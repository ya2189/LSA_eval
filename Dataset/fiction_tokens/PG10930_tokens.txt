the
lease
the
morning
was
bright
after
heavy
rain
and
when
osborn
looked
out
of
the
library
window
a
warm
breeze
shook
the
larches
about
tarnside
hall
now
and
then
a
shadow
sped
across
the
tarn
darkening
the
ripples
that
sparkled
like
silver
when
the
cloud
drove
on
osborn
frowned
for
he
had
meant
to
go
fishing
and
it
was
a
morning
when
the
big
shy
trout
would
rise
his
was
waiting
at
the
boathouse
but
the
postman
had
brought
some
letters
that
made
him
put
off
his
sport
this
was
annoying
because
osborn
hated
to
be
balked
and
seldom
allowed
anything
to
interfere
with
his
amusements
one
letter
from
a
housemaster
at
a
famous
public
school
covered
a
number
of
bills
which
the
writer
stated
somewhat
curtly
ought
to
have
been
paid
another
announced
that
hayes
the
agent
for
the
estate
and
a
tenant
would
wait
upon
osborn
who
knew
what
they
meant
to
talk
about
he
admitted
that
a
landlord
had
duties
but
his
generally
demanded
attention
at
an
inconvenient
time
osborn
was
fifty
years
of
age
he
had
a
ruddy
skin
and
figure
and
was
physically
a
rather
fine
example
of
the
sporting
country
gentleman
for
all
that
there
were
lines
on
his
forehead
and
wrinkles
about
his
eyes
his
mouth
was
loose
and
sensual
and
something
about
him
hinted
at
indulgence
his
manner
as
a
rule
was
abrupt
and
often
overbearing
the
library
was
spacious
the
furniture
in
good
taste
but
getting
shabby
in
fact
a
certain
look
of
age
and
shabbiness
was
typical
of
the
house
although
the
windows
were
open
the
room
had
a
damp
smell
and
the
rows
of
books
that
osborn
never
read
were
touched
with
mildew
rain
was
plentiful
in
the
dale
coal
was
dear
and
osborn
was
forced
to
study
economy
partly
because
her
husband
would
not
by
and
by
osborn
turned
his
glance
from
the
window
and
fixed
it
on
his
son
who
stood
waiting
across
the
big
oak
table
gerald
was
a
handsome
lad
like
his
father
but
marked
by
a
certain
refinement
and
a
hint
of
delicacy
although
he
felt
anxious
his
pose
was
free
and
graceful
and
his
look
undisturbed
osborn
threw
the
bills
on
the
table
this
kind
of
thing
must
stop
he
said
i
have
grumbled
much
perhaps
not
as
much
as
i
ought
about
your
extravagance
but
only
a
fool
imagines
he
can
spend
more
than
he
has
got
we
have
had
such
fools
in
our
family
the
boy
remarked
and
stopped
when
he
saw
osborn
color
rise
it
a
pity
it
true
the
latter
agreed
with
a
patience
he
did
not
often
use
i
paying
for
it
now
and
you
will
pay
a
higher
price
if
you
go
on
as
you
promise
you
must
pull
up
i
done
enough
and
am
getting
tired
of
gerald
smile
faded
he
had
inherited
his
extravagance
from
his
father
but
felt
he
must
be
cautious
although
osborn
sometimes
showed
him
a
forbearance
he
used
to
nobody
else
i
sorry
sir
he
said
perhaps
i
was
extravagant
but
if
you
want
to
be
an
outsider
you
must
do
like
the
rest
and
i
understood
you
expected
me
to
make
friends
among
our
own
set
we
ca
be
shabby
he
struck
the
right
note
for
osborn
was
not
clever
and
perhaps
his
strongest
characteristic
was
his
exaggerated
family
pride
you
had
enough
and
i
paid
your
debts
not
long
since
he
said
in
fact
you
have
had
more
than
your
share
with
the
consequence
that
grace
gets
less
than
hers
he
knitted
his
brows
as
he
indicated
the
curt
letter
then
you
have
given
a
stranger
an
opportunity
for
writing
to
me
like
this
gerald
knowing
his
father
humor
saw
he
was
getting
on
dangerous
ground
brown
a
dry
old
prig
sir
nothing
sporting
about
him
he
hardly
a
gentleman
osborn
was
seldom
logical
and
now
his
annoyance
was
rather
concentrated
on
the
master
who
had
written
to
him
with
jarring
frankness
than
on
the
extravagant
lad
his
letter
implies
it
he
agreed
and
then
pulled
himself
up
gerald
was
clever
and
no
doubt
meant
to
divert
his
thoughts
after
all
this
does
matter
he
went
on
i
pay
these
bills
but
if
you
get
into
debt
at
woolwich
you
had
better
not
come
home
i
have
enough
trouble
about
money
and
your
allowance
is
going
to
be
a
strain
there
another
thing
carter
who
has
had
your
advantages
got
in
as
a
prize
cadet
gerald
smiled
he
has
got
his
commission
old
harry
means
well
but
he
not
our
sort
and
these
plodding
cramming
fellows
seldom
make
good
officers
an
officer
must
pay
his
mess
bills
whether
he
good
or
bad
osborn
rejoined
if
you
go
into
the
horse
artillery
there
wo
be
much
money
left
when
you
have
settled
yours
so
it
might
be
prudent
to
begin
some
now
anyhow
if
you
get
into
debt
again
you
know
the
consequences
he
raised
his
hand
in
dismissal
and
walked
to
the
window
when
the
lad
went
out
he
had
not
taken
the
line
he
meant
to
take
but
gerald
often
so
to
speak
eluded
him
the
lad
had
a
way
of
hinting
that
they
understood
one
another
and
osborn
vaguely
suspected
that
he
worked
upon
his
prejudices
but
he
was
a
sportsman
he
had
pluck
and
knew
what
the
osborn
traditions
demanded
in
fact
gerald
might
go
far
if
he
went
straight
then
osborn
thought
he
needed
a
drink
and
after
ringing
a
bell
he
sat
down
by
the
window
with
the
tray
and
glass
a
servant
brought
it
was
significant
that
he
had
given
no
order
the
servants
knew
what
the
bell
meant
when
he
had
drained
the
glass
he
vacantly
looked
out
boggy
pasture
and
stony
cornfields
ran
back
from
the
tarn
here
and
there
a
white
farmstead
surrounded
by
stunted
trees
stood
at
the
hill
foot
farther
back
a
waterfall
seamed
the
rocks
and
yellow
grass
with
threads
of
foam
and
then
a
lofty
moor
red
with
heather
shut
off
the
view
the
land
was
poor
at
the
dale
head
but
there
was
better
below
where
the
hills
dropped
down
to
the
flat
country
and
with
the
exception
of
ashness
farm
all
was
osborn
from
force
crag
where
the
beck
plunged
from
the
moor
to
the
rich
bottoms
round
allerby
mill
unfortunately
the
estate
was
encumbered
when
he
inherited
it
and
he
had
paid
off
one
mortgage
by
raising
another
he
might
perhaps
have
used
other
means
letting
his
sporting
rights
and
using
economy
but
this
would
have
jarred
the
only
osborn
who
bothered
about
money
was
his
wife
and
alice
was
parsimonious
enough
for
both
money
was
certainly
what
his
agent
called
tight
but
as
long
as
he
could
give
his
friends
some
shooting
and
a
good
dinner
and
live
as
an
osborn
ought
to
live
he
was
satisfied
still
gerald
must
have
his
chance
at
woolwich
and
this
needed
thought
osborn
felt
he
would
like
another
drink
but
glanced
at
his
watch
and
saw
that
his
visitors
would
arrive
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
punctual
and
osborn
got
up
when
his
agent
and
another
man
came
in
hayes
was
tall
urbane
and
dressed
with
rather
fastidious
neatness
bell
was
and
shabby
he
had
a
skin
gray
hair
and
small
cunning
eyes
osborn
indicated
chairs
and
sat
down
at
the
top
of
the
big
table
he
disliked
business
and
knew
the
others
meant
to
persuade
him
to
do
something
he
would
sooner
leave
alone
this
would
have
been
impossible
had
he
not
needed
money
bell
wishes
to
know
if
his
tender
for
the
slate
company
haulage
is
approved
hayes
began
his
traction
engine
is
suited
for
the
work
and
he
is
prepared
to
buy
a
trailer
lurry
which
we
would
find
useful
in
the
dale
mechanical
transport
would
be
a
public
advantage
on
our
hilly
roads
it
needs
a
good
horse
to
bring
half
a
load
from
station
bell
interposed
would
move
as
much
in
yan
day
as
carts
in
four
osborn
agreed
he
was
not
much
of
an
economist
but
it
was
obvious
that
time
and
labor
were
wasted
when
a
farmer
took
a
few
sacks
of
potatoes
to
the
railway
and
another
a
sack
of
wool
there
was
no
difficulty
about
the
tender
because
osborn
was
chairman
of
the
small
slate
company
the
trouble
was
that
the
contract
would
help
bell
to
carry
out
another
plan
the
fellow
was
greedy
and
was
getting
a
rather
dangerous
control
he
had
already
a
lease
of
the
limekilns
and
allerby
mill
but
his
rents
were
regularly
paid
and
it
was
an
advantage
to
deal
with
one
prosperous
tenant
instead
of
several
who
had
not
his
punctuality
and
capital
the
trailer
would
be
useful
if
you
decided
to
make
the
new
terrace
you
thought
about
hayes
suggested
the
cost
of
carting
the
gravel
and
the
slabs
for
the
wall
would
be
heavy
but
i
have
no
doubt
bell
would
undertake
the
work
with
the
trailer
on
very
reasonable
terms
i
might
forget
to
send
in
t
bill
yan
good
turn
deserves
another
bell
remarked
hayes
frowned
he
had
meant
to
imply
something
like
this
but
bell
was
too
blunt
for
all
that
osborn
was
not
very
fastidious
and
had
long
meant
to
make
the
terrace
when
funds
permitted
in
fact
he
hardly
saw
the
thing
as
a
bribe
it
was
rather
a
graceful
recognition
of
his
authority
very
well
he
said
i
sign
the
contract
there
is
another
matter
hayes
resumed
bell
is
willing
to
take
up
harkness
tenancy
of
the
coal
yard
and
seed
store
at
the
station
he
hopes
you
will
grant
him
a
long
lease
osborn
pondered
harkness
had
been
drunken
careless
and
often
behind
with
his
rent
he
had
let
his
business
fall
away
and
it
was
understood
that
bell
who
managed
the
opposition
coal
yard
had
lent
him
small
sums
and
until
recently
kept
him
on
his
feet
this
was
not
because
bell
was
charitable
but
because
if
harkness
came
down
while
he
had
any
trade
left
a
capable
rival
might
take
his
place
in
the
meantime
his
customers
gradually
went
to
bell
and
now
harkness
had
failed
there
was
no
business
to
attract
a
newcomer
i
do
know
said
osborn
i
had
thought
of
advertising
the
yard
and
store
you
get
nobody
to
pay
what
i
offering
bell
replied
a
stranger
would
want
to
see
harkness
books
and
there
nowt
in
them
as
would
tempt
him
to
pay
a
decent
rent
then
with
trailer
going
back
from
station
i
could
beat
him
on
the
haulage
up
the
dale
he
niver
get
his
money
back
if
he
bowt
an
engine
like
mine
this
was
plausible
but
osborn
hesitated
he
saw
that
bell
wanted
a
monopoly
and
had
a
vague
notion
that
he
ought
to
protect
his
tenants
it
sometimes
an
advantage
to
have
two
traders
in
a
place
he
remarked
a
certain
amount
of
competition
is
healthy
i
do
know
if
it
would
be
an
advantage
to
the
estate
and
imagine
you
would
not
get
a
tenant
to
pay
what
bell
offers
hayes
replied
besides
rival
traders
sometimes
agree
to
keep
up
prices
and
competition
does
not
always
make
things
cheap
that
one
of
the
ridiculous
arguments
people
who
want
the
government
to
manage
everything
sometimes
use
said
osborn
with
a
scornful
gesture
hayes
smiled
it
is
very
well
known
that
i
am
not
an
advocate
of
state
ownership
all
the
same
unnecessary
competition
would
be
wasteful
in
the
dale
for
example
if
you
have
two
tenants
at
the
station
the
farmers
who
deal
with
the
new
man
must
use
their
carts
each
coming
separately
for
the
small
load
a
horse
can
take
up
redmire
bank
while
trailer
after
bringing
down
the
slate
would
go
back
empty
then
i
hear
some
talk
about
a
fresh
appeal
to
the
council
to
make
the
loop
road
round
the
hill
for
a
moment
or
two
osborn
did
not
answer
redmire
bank
was
an
obstacle
to
horse
traffic
and
the
road
surveyor
had
plans
for
easing
the
gradient
that
would
necessitate
cutting
down
a
wood
where
osborn
pheasants
found
shelter
he
had
refused
permission
and
the
matter
had
been
dropped
but
if
the
farmers
insisted
the
council
might
be
forced
to
use
their
powers
he
was
obstinate
and
did
not
mean
to
let
them
have
the
wood
unless
he
could
get
his
price
you
know
my
opinion
about
that
he
said
yes
said
hayes
i
imagine
it
would
be
prudent
not
to
have
the
matter
brought
up
however
if
bell
can
send
back
his
lurry
full
the
economy
is
plain
it
will
enable
him
to
sell
his
coal
and
seed
at
a
moderate
price
and
pay
a
higher
rent
that
so
osborn
agreed
and
knitted
his
brows
he
doubted
if
bell
would
give
his
customers
the
benefit
of
the
cheaper
haulage
but
the
advantage
of
getting
a
higher
rent
was
obvious
osborn
knew
he
was
being
persuaded
to
do
a
shabby
thing
and
hesitated
money
however
was
needed
and
must
be
got
very
well
he
said
bell
can
have
the
lease
they
talked
about
something
else
and
when
osborn
went
fishing
after
the
others
left
the
wind
had
dropped
the
sun
was
bright
and
the
trout
would
not
rise
he
felt
rather
injured
because
he
had
paid
for
his
attention
to
duty
when
he
joined
his
wife
and
daughter
at
tea
on
the
lawn
a
copper
beech
threw
a
cool
shadow
across
the
small
table
and
basket
chairs
the
china
and
silver
were
old
and
good
beyond
the
belt
of
wavering
shade
the
recently
mown
grass
gave
out
a
moist
smell
in
the
hot
sun
the
grass
grew
fine
and
close
for
the
turf
was
old
but
there
were
patches
of
ugly
weeds
the
borders
by
the
house
were
thinly
planted
and
the
color
plan
was
rude
but
one
could
not
do
much
with
a
rheumatic
gardener
and
a
boy
there
used
to
be
two
men
but
osborn
had
insisted
on
cutting
wages
down
across
the
yew
hedge
the
tarn
sparkled
like
a
mirror
and
on
its
farther
side
where
a
clump
of
dark
pines
overhung
a
beach
of
silver
sand
the
hillslopes
shone
with
yellow
grass
relieved
by
the
green
of
fern
and
belts
of
moss
the
spot
was
picturesque
the
old
house
with
its
low
straight
front
and
mullioned
windows
round
which
creepers
grew
had
a
touch
of
quiet
beauty
osborn
was
proud
of
tarnside
although
he
sometimes
chafed
because
he
had
not
enough
money
to
care
for
it
as
he
ought
by
and
by
he
glanced
at
his
wife
who
had
silently
filled
the
cups
and
was
cutting
cake
she
was
a
thin
quiet
woman
with
a
hint
of
reserve
in
her
delicately
molded
face
sometimes
she
tactfully
exercised
a
restraining
influence
but
for
the
most
part
acquiesced
for
she
had
found
out
soon
after
her
marriage
that
her
husband
must
not
be
opposed
grace
who
sat
opposite
had
recently
come
home
from
school
and
was
marked
by
an
independence
somewhat
unusual
at
tarnside
she
argued
with
osborn
and
was
firm
when
he
got
angry
then
she
had
a
fresh
enthusiasm
for
change
and
improvement
and
a
generous
faith
in
what
she
thought
was
good
since
osborn
was
obstinately
conventional
this
sometimes
led
to
jars
after
all
i
going
to
have
the
terrace
made
he
remarked
and
waited
for
his
wife
approval
is
it
prudent
she
asked
hesitatingly
if
i
remember
you
thought
the
work
would
cost
too
much
when
we
talked
about
it
last
it
will
cost
very
little
in
fact
i
imagine
the
haulage
of
the
gravel
and
the
slabs
for
the
wall
will
cost
nothing
osborn
replied
bell
has
promised
to
bring
me
all
the
stuff
we
need
with
his
new
trailer
oh
said
grace
rather
sharply
i
suppose
this
means
you
have
given
him
the
lease
of
the
station
coal
yard
no
doubt
he
offered
to
bring
the
gravel
before
you
agreed
he
cunning
and
knew
you
wanted
the
terrace
i
ca
remember
if
he
offered
before
or
afterwards
osborn
replied
with
a
touch
of
embarrassment
anyhow
i
do
think
it
important
because
i
did
not
allow
his
offer
to
persuade
me
for
all
that
it
some
satisfaction
to
get
the
work
done
cheap
grace
pondered
she
was
intelligent
contact
with
her
school
companions
had
developed
her
character
and
she
had
begun
to
understand
osborn
since
she
came
home
she
knew
he
was
easily
deceived
and
sometimes
deceived
himself
no
she
said
i
do
think
the
work
will
really
be
cheap
it
often
expensive
to
take
a
favor
from
a
man
like
bell
he
will
find
a
means
of
making
you
pay
ridiculous
bell
ca
make
me
pay
then
he
will
make
somebody
else
pay
for
what
he
does
for
you
and
hardly
honest
to
let
him
grace
insisted
osborn
gave
her
a
warning
glance
and
osborn
face
got
red
it
a
new
thing
for
a
young
girl
to
criticize
her
father
this
is
what
comes
of
indulging
your
mother
and
making
some
sacrifice
to
send
you
to
an
expensive
modern
school
if
i
had
my
way
you
would
have
gone
to
another
where
they
teach
the
virtues
modesty
obedience
and
respect
for
parents
grace
smiled
because
she
knew
the
school
osborn
meant
and
the
type
it
produced
she
was
grateful
to
her
mother
for
a
better
start
i
sorry
she
said
quietly
but
with
a
hint
of
resolution
i
do
want
to
criticize
but
bell
is
greedy
and
cunning
and
now
he
has
got
both
coal
yards
will
charge
the
farmers
more
than
he
ought
he
has
already
got
too
large
a
share
of
all
the
business
that
is
done
in
the
dale
it
obvious
that
you
have
learned
less
than
you
think
osborn
rejoined
feeling
that
he
was
on
safer
ground
you
do
seem
to
understand
that
concentration
means
economy
bell
for
example
buys
and
stores
his
goods
in
large
quantities
instead
of
handling
a
number
of
small
lots
at
different
times
which
would
cost
him
more
i
can
see
that
grace
admitted
but
i
imagine
he
will
keep
all
he
saves
you
know
the
farmers
are
grumbling
about
his
charges
osborn
frowned
you
talk
too
much
to
the
farm
people
i
do
like
it
you
can
be
polite
but
i
want
you
to
remember
they
are
my
tenants
and
not
to
sympathize
with
their
imaginary
grievances
they
a
grumbling
lot
but
will
keep
their
places
if
you
leave
them
alone
he
got
up
abruptly
and
when
he
went
off
across
the
lawn
osborn
gave
the
girl
a
reproachful
glance
you
are
very
rash
my
dear
on
the
whole
your
father
was
remarkably
patient
grace
laughed
a
rather
strained
laugh
as
osborn
angry
voice
rose
from
behind
a
shrubbery
he
is
patient
now
and
i
afraid
jackson
is
paying
for
my
fault
however
i
really
think
i
was
patient
too
to
talk
about
people
keeping
their
places
is
ridiculous
in
fact
it
piffle
father
notions
are
horribly
out
of
date
one
wonders
he
does
know
things
change
perhaps
we
do
quite
realize
this
when
we
are
getting
old
but
you
must
argue
with
your
father
he
does
like
it
and
when
he
annoyed
everybody
suffers
it
true
but
how
illogical
grace
remarked
and
mused
while
she
looked
dreamily
across
the
grass
she
was
romantic
and
generous
and
had
learned
something
about
social
economy
at
the
famous
school
in
fact
osborn
would
have
been
startled
had
he
suspected
how
much
she
knew
nevertheless
she
was
young
her
studies
were
half
digested
and
her
theories
crude
she
had
come
home
with
a
vague
notion
of
playing
the
part
of
lady
bountiful
and
putting
things
right
but
had
got
a
jar
soon
after
she
began
her
father
idea
of
justice
was
elementary
he
resented
her
meddling
and
was
sometimes
tyrannical
when
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
taken
an
improper
line
he
blamed
his
agent
but
perhaps
the
worst
was
he
seldom
knew
when
he
was
wrong
then
the
agent
main
object
was
to
extort
as
much
money
from
the
tenants
as
possible
grace
did
not
see
what
she
could
do
although
she
felt
that
something
ought
to
be
done
she
had
a
raw
undisciplined
enthusiasm
and
imagined
that
she
was
somehow
responsible
yet
when
she
tried
to
use
some
influence
her
father
got
savage
and
she
felt
hurt
well
she
must
try
to
be
patient
and
tactful
while
she
meditated
osborn
got
up
and
they
went
back
to
the
house
chapter
ii
the
otter
hounds
grace
tweed
dress
was
wet
and
rather
muddy
when
she
stood
with
gerald
on
a
gravel
bank
at
the
head
of
a
pool
where
the
beck
from
the
tarn
joined
a
larger
stream
that
flowed
through
a
neighboring
dale
there
had
been
some
rain
and
the
water
was
stained
a
warm
by
the
peat
bright
sunshine
pierced
the
tossing
alder
branches
and
the
rapid
close
by
sparkled
between
belts
of
moving
shade
large
white
dogs
with
black
and
yellow
spots
swam
uncertainly
about
the
pool
and
searched
the
bank
a
group
of
men
stood
in
the
rapid
while
another
group
watched
the
tail
of
the
pool
somewhere
between
them
a
otter
hid
a
few
of
the
men
wore
red
coats
and
belonged
to
the
hunt
the
rest
were
shepherds
and
farmers
whom
custom
entitled
to
join
in
the
sport
all
carried
long
poles
and
waited
with
keen
expectation
the
reappearance
of
the
otter
grace
was
perhaps
the
only
one
to
feel
a
touch
of
pity
for
the
exhausted
animal
and
she
wondered
whether
this
was
not
a
sentimental
weakness
there
was
not
much
to
be
said
for
the
otter
right
to
live
it
was
stealthy
cruel
and
horribly
destructive
killing
many
more
fish
and
moorhens
than
it
could
eat
indeed
before
she
went
to
school
she
had
followed
the
hunt
with
pleasant
excitement
and
was
now
rather
surprised
to
find
the
sport
had
lost
its
zest
the
odds
against
the
otter
were
too
great
although
it
had
for
some
hours
baffled
men
who
knew
the
river
and
dogs
it
had
stolen
up
shallow
rapids
slipping
between
the
watchers
legs
dived
under
swimming
dogs
made
bold
dashes
along
the
bank
and
hidden
in
belts
of
reeds
its
capture
had
often
looked
certain
and
yet
it
had
escaped
at
first
grace
had
noticed
the
animal
confidence
beauty
of
form
and
strength
but
it
had
gradually
got
slack
hesitating
and
limp
now
when
it
lurked
in
the
depths
of
the
pool
while
its
pitiless
enemies
waited
for
it
to
come
up
to
breathe
she
began
to
wish
it
would
get
away
thorn
the
master
of
the
hounds
was
talking
to
his
huntsman
not
far
off
he
was
a
friend
of
osborn
and
grace
had
once
thought
him
a
dashing
and
accomplished
man
of
the
world
but
had
recently
for
no
obvious
reason
felt
antagonistic
alan
was
not
as
clever
as
she
had
imagined
he
was
smart
sometimes
cheaply
smart
which
was
another
thing
then
he
was
beginning
to
get
fat
and
she
vaguely
shrank
from
the
way
he
now
and
then
looked
at
her
on
the
whole
it
was
a
relief
to
note
that
he
was
occupied
for
a
few
moments
grace
let
her
eyes
wander
up
the
dale
to
the
crags
where
the
force
leaped
down
from
the
red
moor
at
malton
head
belts
of
dry
shone
like
gold
and
mossy
patches
glimmered
luminously
green
the
fall
looked
like
white
lace
drawn
across
the
stones
a
streak
of
mist
touched
the
lofty
crag
and
above
it
a
soft
white
cloud
trailed
across
the
sky
then
she
turned
as
her
brother
spoke
alan
has
given
us
a
good
hunt
and
means
to
make
a
kill
he
rather
a
selfish
beast
and
a
bit
too
sure
of
himself
but
he
runs
the
pack
well
and
knows
how
to
get
the
best
out
of
life
no
woolwich
and
sweating
as
a
snubbed
subaltern
for
him
he
stopped
at
home
saw
his
tenants
farmed
well
and
shot
his
game
that
my
notion
of
a
country
gentleman
father
can
look
after
tarnside
and
a
duty
goes
with
owning
land
grace
remarked
a
landlord
who
need
not
work
ought
to
serve
the
state
that
idea
was
perhaps
the
best
thing
in
the
feudal
system
and
it
not
altogether
forgotten
yet
father
was
right
when
he
decided
to
make
you
a
soldier
he
can
send
me
to
woolwich
but
after
all
that
as
far
as
he
can
go
you
not
at
your
best
when
you
improving
gerald
rejoined
and
added
with
a
grin
you
do
like
old
alan
do
you
i
thought
you
snubbed
him
half
an
hour
since
grace
colored
but
did
not
answer
she
had
hurt
her
foot
by
falling
from
a
mossy
boulder
and
thorn
had
come
to
help
as
she
floundered
across
a
shallow
pool
she
was
draggled
and
her
hair
was
loose
and
thorn
faint
amusement
annoyed
her
somehow
it
hinted
at
familiarity
she
would
not
have
resented
it
once
for
they
had
been
friends
but
when
she
came
home
and
he
had
tried
to
renew
the
friendship
she
had
noted
a
subtle
difference
alan
was
forty
but
now
she
had
left
school
the
disparity
of
their
ages
was
in
a
sense
much
less
marked
then
a
shout
roused
her
and
she
looked
round
where
the
smooth
brown
water
ran
past
the
alder
roots
a
very
small
dark
object
moved
in
advance
of
a
faint
widening
ripple
grace
knew
it
was
the
point
of
the
otter
head
the
animal
lungs
were
empty
since
it
remained
up
so
long
next
moment
plunging
dogs
churned
the
pool
into
foam
the
object
vanished
and
men
ran
along
the
bank
to
the
lower
rapid
while
those
already
there
beat
the
shallow
with
their
poles
the
dogs
bunched
together
and
began
to
swim
up
stream
gerald
and
one
or
two
more
plunged
into
the
water
and
for
a
few
moments
the
otter
showed
itself
again
it
looked
like
a
fish
and
not
an
animal
as
it
broke
the
surface
rising
in
graceful
leaps
then
it
went
down
with
the
dogs
swimming
hard
close
behind
and
grace
thought
it
must
be
caught
it
was
being
steadily
driven
to
the
lower
end
of
the
stopped
rapid
where
the
water
was
scarcely
a
foot
deep
the
animal
reappeared
plunging
in
and
out
among
the
shallows
but
forging
up
stream
and
the
men
who
meant
to
turn
it
back
closed
up
there
was
one
at
every
yard
across
the
belt
of
sparkling
foam
they
had
spiked
poles
to
beat
the
water
and
it
seemed
impossible
that
their
victim
could
get
past
yet
the
otter
vanished
and
for
a
minute
or
two
there
was
silence
until
the
dogs
rushed
up
the
bank
then
somebody
shouted
the
huntsman
blew
his
horn
and
a
small
ripple
trailed
very
slowly
across
the
next
pool
the
otter
had
somehow
stolen
past
the
watchers
legs
and
reached
deep
water
but
its
slowness
told
that
its
strength
had
gone
the
dogs
took
the
water
with
a
splash
and
grace
turned
her
head
she
felt
pitiful
and
did
not
want
to
see
the
end
the
animal
had
made
a
gallant
fight
and
she
shrank
from
the
butchery
the
clatter
of
heavy
boots
on
stones
suddenly
stopped
there
was
a
curious
pause
and
grace
looked
up
as
somebody
shouted
to
holt
ca
off
your
hounds
wheer
t
terrier
the
hunt
swept
up
the
bank
smashed
through
a
hedge
and
spread
along
the
margin
of
the
neighboring
pool
a
few
big
alders
grew
beside
its
edge
sending
down
their
roots
into
deep
water
but
for
the
most
part
the
bank
was
supported
by
timbers
driven
into
the
soil
and
freshly
laid
with
turf
grace
knew
this
had
been
done
to
protect
the
meadow
because
the
stream
is
thrown
against
the
concave
side
when
a
pool
lies
in
a
bend
as
she
stopped
at
the
broken
hedge
a
man
ran
past
carrying
a
small
wet
terrier
and
two
or
three
more
came
up
with
spades
the
otter
could
not
escape
now
since
the
hounds
would
watch
the
underwater
entrance
to
the
cave
among
the
alder
roots
while
the
terrier
would
crawl
down
from
the
other
side
if
a
hole
could
not
be
found
the
men
would
dig
they
were
interrupted
soon
after
they
began
for
somebody
said
put
down
your
spade
tom
hold
the
terrier
grace
studied
the
man
who
had
interfered
he
was
young
and
on
the
whole
attractive
his
face
was
honest
and
sunburned
he
carried
himself
well
and
was
dressed
rather
neatly
in
knickerbockers
and
shooting
jacket
she
knew
christopher
askew
was
the
son
of
a
neighboring
farmer
who
owned
his
land
then
as
the
men
stopped
digging
thorn
pushed
past
what
this
he
asked
haughtily
why
have
you
meddled
askew
looked
hard
at
him
but
answered
in
a
quiet
voice
it
cost
us
some
trouble
to
mend
the
bank
and
if
you
dig
out
the
otter
the
stream
will
soon
make
an
ugly
gap
then
it
a
matter
of
the
cost
said
thorn
how
much
not
altogether
askew
replied
coloring
it
a
matter
of
the
damage
the
next
flood
may
do
we
had
an
awkward
job
to
strengthen
the
bank
and
i
not
going
to
have
it
cut
noo
kit
dinna
spoil
sport
the
old
huntsman
urged
it
none
a
trick
for
a
canny
lad
to
cheat
the
hounds
put
terrier
in
an
niver
mind
him
shouted
another
and
there
were
cries
of
approval
stop
digging
tom
askew
said
with
quiet
firmness
pick
up
the
dog
we
are
wasting
time
thorn
remarked
i
do
like
bargaining
you
had
better
state
your
price
grace
looking
on
across
the
broken
hedge
sympathized
with
the
farmer
for
one
thing
she
wanted
the
otter
to
escape
besides
she
approved
the
man
resolute
quietness
he
had
pluck
since
it
was
plain
that
he
was
taking
an
unpopular
line
and
he
used
some
because
tone
was
strongly
provocative
in
fact
she
thought
thorn
was
not
at
his
best
he
was
not
entitled
to
suggest
that
the
other
was
trying
to
extort
as
much
money
as
he
could
no
more
do
i
like
bargaining
askew
replied
there
will
be
no
digging
here
you
have
smashed
the
hedge
and
that
enough
call
off
your
dogs
so
you
mean
to
spoil
sport
even
if
the
damage
costs
you
nothing
i
know
your
kind
it
getting
common
oh
no
said
askew
i
wo
have
the
bank
cut
down
but
that
is
all
if
you
like
you
can
look
for
another
otter
on
our
part
of
the
stream
thorn
gave
him
a
searching
glance
and
then
seeing
he
was
resolute
shrugged
contemptuously
the
huntsman
blew
his
horn
the
dogs
were
drawn
off
and
gerald
followed
the
others
across
the
field
grace
however
sat
down
on
a
fallen
tree
to
rest
her
foot
and
for
a
minute
or
two
thought
herself
alone
then
she
rose
as
askew
came
through
the
gap
in
the
hedge
he
began
to
pull
about
the
broken
rails
and
thorns
but
saw
her
when
he
looked
up
they
have
left
you
behind
miss
osborn
he
remarked
with
a
smile
i
think
i
had
enough
besides
i
hurt
my
foot
badly
no
said
grace
i
have
only
begun
to
feel
it
hurt
but
i
wish
it
was
quite
so
far
to
the
bridge
askew
looked
at
the
water
measuring
its
height
the
stepping
stones
are
not
far
off
one
or
two
may
be
covered
but
perhaps
i
could
help
you
across
and
it
would
save
you
a
mile
grace
went
on
with
him
and
they
presently
stopped
beneath
the
alder
branches
by
a
sparkling
shallow
tall
brush
grew
up
the
shady
bank
and
briars
trailed
in
the
stream
a
row
of
stones
ran
across
but
there
were
gaps
where
the
current
foamed
over
some
that
were
lower
than
the
rest
grace
foot
was
getting
worse
and
sitting
down
on
a
slab
of
the
slate
stile
she
glanced
at
her
companion
i
imagine
it
needed
some
pluck
to
stop
the
hunt
she
said
for
one
thing
you
were
alone
nobody
agreed
with
you
askew
smiled
opposition
sometimes
makes
one
obstinate
but
do
you
think
it
hard
to
stand
alone
yes
said
grace
impulsively
i
know
it
hard
yet
of
course
if
you
feel
you
are
taking
the
proper
line
you
ought
to
be
daunted
by
what
others
think
she
stopped
remembering
that
the
man
was
a
stranger
and
then
resumed
in
a
different
tone
but
why
did
you
really
stop
the
hunt
are
you
one
of
the
people
who
do
believe
in
sport
no
said
askew
good
humoredly
it
curious
that
thorn
hinted
something
like
that
anyhow
i
not
a
champion
of
the
otter
right
to
destroy
useful
fish
i
think
they
ought
to
be
shot
oh
said
grace
with
a
touch
of
indignation
you
would
shoot
an
otter
well
i
suppose
they
must
be
killed
but
to
use
a
gun
it
better
for
the
otter
which
do
you
imagine
it
would
choose
a
mercifully
sudden
end
or
two
or
three
hours
of
agony
with
men
and
dogs
close
behind
until
the
exhausted
animal
is
torn
to
pieces
or
mangled
by
the
poles
i
suppose
one
must
answer
as
you
expect
you
honest
askew
remarked
i
imagine
it
cost
you
something
to
agree
it
did
grace
admitted
after
all
you
know
our
traditions
and
many
people
not
cruel
people
like
the
sport
that
is
so
but
let
take
the
hunt
for
an
example
there
were
three
or
four
men
without
an
occupation
and
no
doubt
they
find
following
the
hounds
healthy
exercise
the
others
had
left
work
that
ought
to
be
done
in
fact
if
you
think
you
own
that
some
were
men
we
have
not
much
use
for
in
the
dale
yes
said
grace
with
some
reluctance
i
know
the
men
you
mean
all
the
same
it
is
really
not
our
business
to
decide
if
they
ought
to
work
or
hunt
askew
looked
amused
and
she
liked
his
twinkle
he
was
obviously
intelligent
and
on
the
whole
she
approved
his
unconventional
point
of
view
conventional
insincerities
were
the
rule
at
tarnside
besides
although
it
was
possible
she
ought
not
to
talk
to
the
man
with
such
freedom
her
foot
hurt
and
the
stile
made
a
comfortable
seat
she
liked
to
watch
the
shadows
quiver
on
the
stream
and
hear
the
current
brawl
among
the
stones
this
was
an
excuse
for
stopping
since
she
would
not
acknowledge
that
the
young
farmer
society
had
some
charm
after
a
moment
or
two
he
resumed
it
is
not
my
business
anyhow
and
i
do
want
to
argue
if
is
a
proper
sport
it
an
advantage
so
to
speak
to
stick
to
the
point
all
i
objected
to
was
the
hunt
breaking
down
the
mended
bank
there
are
not
many
good
meadows
at
the
and
grass
land
is
too
valuable
to
be
destroyed
do
you
think
this
justifies
my
opposition
i
suppose
it
does
grace
agreed
and
then
decided
that
she
had
talked
to
him
enough
well
i
must
go
on
she
added
with
a
doubtful
glance
at
the
stream
but
it
does
look
as
if
one
could
get
across
you
can
try
askew
replied
and
jumping
down
stood
in
the
water
holding
out
his
hand
come
on
there
not
much
risk
of
a
slip
since
it
was
too
late
to
refuse
grace
took
his
hand
and
he
waded
across
steadying
her
while
the
current
rippled
round
his
legs
some
of
the
stones
were
covered
but
with
his
support
she
sprang
across
the
gaps
and
the
effort
did
not
hurt
her
foot
as
much
as
she
had
thought
he
was
not
awkward
she
liked
his
firm
grasp
and
his
care
that
she
did
not
fall
particularly
since
she
saw
he
was
satisfied
to
give
her
the
help
she
needed
and
knew
when
to
stop
after
she
got
across
she
thanked
him
and
let
him
go
when
she
crossed
the
field
askew
went
home
in
a
thoughtful
mood
though
he
was
conscious
of
a
pleasant
thrill
he
had
felt
the
girl
charm
strongly
as
he
stood
near
her
at
the
stile
and
now
tried
to
recapture
the
scene
the
dark
alder
branches
moving
overhead
the
sparkle
of
the
water
and
the
light
and
shadow
that
touched
his
companion
her
face
was
attractive
although
he
was
not
a
judge
of
female
beauty
he
knew
its
molding
was
good
mouth
nose
and
chin
were
finely
but
firmly
lined
her
color
was
delicate
pink
and
white
and
she
had
rather
grave
blue
eyes
her
figure
was
marked
by
a
touch
of
patrician
grace
askew
smiled
as
he
admitted
that
patrician
was
a
word
he
disliked
but
he
could
not
think
of
another
that
quite
expressed
what
he
meant
anyhow
the
girl
charm
was
strong
she
was
plucky
and
frank
perhaps
because
she
knew
her
value
and
need
not
to
pretend
to
dignity
in
a
sense
this
was
patrician
too
all
the
same
askew
though
young
and
romantic
was
not
a
fool
he
had
had
a
good
education
and
had
then
spent
two
years
at
an
agricultural
college
but
he
was
a
farmer
son
and
he
knew
where
he
stood
from
the
osborns
point
of
view
he
had
been
of
help
but
this
was
no
reason
miss
osborn
should
recognize
him
when
they
next
met
yet
he
somehow
thought
she
would
in
the
meantime
it
was
rash
to
think
about
her
much
although
his
thoughts
returned
to
the
stile
beneath
the
alders
where
he
had
watched
the
sun
and
shadow
play
about
her
face
chapter
iii
a
council
of
defence
the
sun
had
sunk
behind
the
moors
when
peter
askew
sat
by
an
open
window
in
his
big
kitchen
at
ashness
all
was
quiet
outside
except
for
the
hoarse
turmoil
of
the
force
and
a
distant
bleating
of
sheep
in
front
across
a
stony
pasture
the
fellside
ran
up
abruptly
its
summit
edged
with
purple
heath
cut
against
a
belt
of
yellow
sky
the
long
green
slope
was
broken
by
rocky
scars
and
dotted
by
small
herdwick
sheep
that
looked
like
scattered
stones
until
they
moved
the
kitchen
was
shadowy
because
the
house
was
old
and
built
with
low
mullioned
windows
to
keep
out
snow
and
storm
and
a
clump
of
stunted
ash
trees
grew
outside
the
courtyard
wall
a
fire
of
roots
and
peat
however
burned
in
the
deep
hearth
and
now
and
then
a
flickering
glow
touched
old
copper
and
dark
oak
with
red
reflections
collectors
had
sometimes
offered
to
buy
the
tall
clock
and
ponderous
meal
chest
but
askew
would
not
sell
the
most
part
of
his
furniture
had
been
brought
to
ashness
by
his
peter
face
was
brown
and
deeply
lined
and
his
shoulders
were
bent
for
he
had
led
a
life
of
steady
toil
this
was
rather
from
choice
than
stern
necessity
because
he
owned
the
farm
and
had
money
enough
to
cultivate
it
well
as
a
rule
he
was
reserved
and
thoughtful
but
his
neighbors
trusted
him
they
knew
he
was
clever
although
he
used
their
homely
dialect
and
lived
as
frugally
as
themselves
in
the
dale
one
worked
hard
and
spent
no
more
than
one
need
yet
peter
had
broken
the
latter
rule
when
he
resolved
to
give
his
son
a
wider
outlook
than
he
had
had
kit
had
gone
from
the
lonely
farm
to
a
good
school
where
he
had
beaten
by
brains
and
resolution
the
sons
of
professional
and
business
men
his
teachers
said
he
had
talent
and
although
peter
was
often
lonely
since
his
wife
died
he
meant
to
give
the
lad
his
chance
somewhat
to
his
relief
kit
decided
to
return
to
the
soil
and
peter
sent
him
to
an
agricultural
college
since
kit
meant
to
farm
he
should
be
armed
by
such
advantages
as
modern
science
could
give
it
was
obvious
that
he
would
need
them
all
in
the
struggle
against
low
prices
and
the
inclement
weather
that
vexed
the
dale
now
he
had
come
home
in
a
sense
not
much
changed
and
peter
was
satisfied
kit
and
he
seldom
jarred
and
the
dalesfolk
who
did
not
know
how
like
they
were
under
the
surface
sometimes
thought
it
strange
four
or
five
of
their
neighbors
sat
in
the
kitchen
for
the
most
part
smoking
quietly
but
now
and
then
grumbling
about
the
recent
heavy
rain
this
was
not
what
they
had
come
to
talk
about
and
peter
waited
he
knew
their
cautious
reserve
they
were
obstinate
and
slow
to
move
and
if
he
tried
to
hurry
them
might
take
alarm
by
and
by
one
knocked
out
his
pipe
how
are
you
getting
forrad
with
t
he
asked
we
have
cut
enough
to
last
for
three
or
four
months
you
need
it
aw
coal
a
terrible
price
another
remarked
it
will
be
dearer
soon
said
peter
since
bell
has
t
lease
o
both
coal
yards
he
can
charge
what
he
likes
a
grasping
man
yan
canna
get
feeding

unless
yan
pays
his
price
noo
he
has
t
kilns
and
mill
he
own
aw
t
dale
before
lang
it
very
possible
unless
you
stop
him
kit
interposed
landlord
ought
to
stop
him
one
rejoined
kit
smiled
that
too
much
to
expect
it
your
business
to
help
yourselves
osborn
takes
the
highest
rent
that
offered
and
you
missed
your
chance
when
you
let
bell
get
allerby
mill
neabody
else
had
t
money
another
grumbled
two
or
three
of
us
could
have
clubbed
together
and
made
a
profit
after
selling
feeding
stuff
at
a
moderate
price
the
others
were
silent
for
a
minute
of
two
and
kit
let
them
ponder
he
had
learned
something
about
the
wastefulness
of
individual
effort
and
on
his
return
to
ashness
had
urged
the
farmers
to
join
in
bidding
for
a
lease
of
the
mill
they
had
refused
and
would
need
careful
handling
now
for
the
old
cooperative
customs
that
had
ruled
in
the
dale
before
the
railway
came
had
gone
poor
folks
willunt
have
much
left
for
groceries
when
they
have
paid
bell
price
for
coal
said
one
since
he
gets
his
money
for
hauling
in
t
slate
it
costs
him
nowt
to
tak
a
big
load
back
on
t
lurry
but
with
redmire
bank
to
clim
it
a
terrible
loss
o
time
carting
half
a
ton
up
dale
you
wo
be
able
to
buy
the
unless
you
deal
with
bell
i
think
you
find
he
has
a
contract
for
all
the
coal
that
comes
down
the
line
they
pondered
this
and
another
remarked
peat
terrible
messy
stuff
and
bad
to
dry
at
back
end
o
year
it
can
be
dried
said
an
old
man
i
mind
the
time
when
iver
a
load
coals
went
past
allerby
aw
t
folk
clubbed
togedder
to
cut
and
haul
peat
from
malton
browt
it
doon
on
by
the
oad
green
road
howiver
i
reckon
it
cost
them
summat
counting
their
time
kit
gave
him
a
paper
this
is
what
our
peat
has
cost
us
i
charged
our
labor
and
what
the
horses
would
have
earned
if
we
had
been
paid
for
plowing
they
studied
the
figures
passing
the
paper
around
and
then
one
said
but
peat
costs
you
nowt
malton
moor
is
yours
and
i
ken
nea
ither
peat
worth
cutting
mayhappen
yan
could
find
some
soft
trash
on
the
back
moor
but
i
doot
if
osborn
would
let
yan
bring
it
doon
osborn
does
what
his
agent
says
and
it
weel
kent
hayes
is
a
friend
bell
another
agreed
peter
smiled
and
gave
kit
a
warning
glance
he
suspected
the
agent
had
a
private
understanding
that
was
not
to
his
employer
benefit
with
bell
but
this
was
another
matter
peter
had
taught
his
son
to
concentrate
on
the
business
in
hand
weel
he
said
you
can
have
aw
t
peat
you
want
and
we
willunt
fratch
if
you
pay
me
nowt
there
acres
o
good
stuff
on
malton
moor
and
the
value
o
peat
t
labor
it
costs
to
cut
aw
t
same
it
willunt
pay
to
send
a
man
or
two
noo
and
then
you
must
work
in
a
gang
ivery
man
at
his
proper
job
it
was
done
like
that
in
oad
days
said
one
peter
looked
at
kit
who
did
not
speak
for
both
knew
when
enough
was
said
indeed
although
he
was
hardly
conscious
of
it
yet
kit
had
something
of
a
leader
talent
for
a
few
minutes
the
others
smoked
and
thought
they
were
independent
and
suspicious
about
new
plans
but
it
was
obvious
that
the
best
defense
against
a
monopoly
was
a
combine
in
fact
they
began
to
see
it
was
the
only
defense
they
had
then
one
turned
to
peter
if
you
for
stopping
bell
robbing
us
and
starving
poor
folk
at
allerby
i
with
you
one
after
another
promised
his
support
a
plan
was
agreed
upon
and
peter
was
satisfied
when
his
neighbors
went
away
they
were
patient
cautious
and
hard
to
move
but
he
knew
their
obstinacy
when
they
were
roused
now
they
had
started
they
would
go
on
stubbornly
taking
a
road
that
was
new
to
them
bell
of
course
would
make
a
cunning
fight
but
peter
doubted
if
he
would
win
i
reckon
your
plan
will
work
he
said
to
kit
with
a
nod
of
satisfaction
kit
nodded
and
picking
up
his
hat
and
some
letters
went
out
as
he
walked
down
the
dale
the
moon
rose
above
a
shadowy
fell
touching
the
opposite
hillside
with
silver
light
that
reached
the
fields
at
the
bottom
farther
on
tall
pikes
of
wet
hay
threw
dark
shadows
across
a
meadow
and
he
heard
the
roar
of
a
swollen
beck
there
was
too
much
water
in
the
dale
but
kit
knew
something
might
be
done
to
make
farming
pay
in
spite
of
the
weather
land
that
had
gone
sour
might
be
recovered
by
draining
and
a
bank
could
be
built
where
the
river
now
and
then
washed
away
the
crops
osborn
however
was
poor
and
extravagant
and
his
agent
talents
were
rather
applied
to
raising
rents
than
improving
the
soil
kit
stopped
when
he
got
near
allerby
where
the
dale
widens
and
a
cluster
of
low
white
houses
stands
among
old
trees
the
village
glimmered
in
the
moonlight
and
beyond
it
rolling
country
dotted
by
dark
woods
ran
back
to
the
sea
a
beck
plunged
down
the
hillside
with
a
muffled
roar
and
a
building
half
in
light
and
half
in
shadow
occupied
the
hollow
of
the
ghyll
kit
leaning
on
the
bridge
watched
the
glistening
thread
of
water
that
trickled
over
the
new
iron
wheel
and
noted
the
raw
slate
slabs
that
had
been
recently
built
into
the
mossy
wall
a
big
traction
engine
neatly
covered
by
a
tarpaulin
and
a
trailer
lurry
stood
in
front
of
the
sliding
door
osborn
had
spent
some
money
here
for
allerby
mill
with
its
seed
and
chemical
manure
stores
paid
him
a
higher
rent
than
the
best
of
his
small
farms
it
was
obviously
well
managed
by
the
tenant
and
kit
approved
modern
machines
and
methods
although
expensive
were
good
and
were
needed
in
the
dale
the
trouble
was
they
sometimes
gave
the
man
who
could
use
them
power
to
rob
his
poorer
neighbors
kit
saw
that
concentrated
power
was
often
dangerous
and
since
unorganized
individual
effort
was
no
longer
profitable
he
knew
no
cure
but
cooperation
although
young
he
was
seldom
rash
enthusiasm
is
not
common
in
the
bleak
northern
dales
whose
inhabitants
are
for
the
most
part
conservative
and
slow
wind
and
rain
had
hardened
him
and
he
had
inherited
a
reserved
strength
and
quietness
from
ancestors
who
had
braved
the
storms
that
raged
about
ashness
yet
the
north
is
not
always
stern
for
now
and
then
the
gray
sky
breaks
and
fell
and
dale
shine
in
dazzling
light
and
melt
with
mystic
beauty
into
passing
shade
kit
like
his
country
varied
in
his
moods
sometimes
he
forgot
to
be
practical
and
his
caution
vanished
leaving
him
romantic
and
imaginative
he
went
on
and
as
he
reached
the
first
of
the
white
houses
a
girl
came
out
of
a
gate
and
stopped
where
the
moonlight
fell
across
the
road
she
had
some
beauty
and
her
pose
was
graceful
oh
she
exclaimed
with
rather
exaggerated
surprise
it
kit
i
suppose
you
take
this
letter
i
was
going
to
the
post
kit
did
not
know
much
about
young
women
but
hesitated
because
he
doubted
if
she
wanted
him
to
post
the
letter
if
you
like
he
said
i
expect
the
causeway
at
the
will
be
wet
she
gave
him
a
curious
smile
oh
well
here
the
letter
jim
nixon
had
to
help
me
across
the
water
when
i
went
last
night
and
i
do
suppose
you
afraid
of
wetting
your
feet
you
are
used
to
it
at
ashness
yes
said
kit
my
boots
are
stronger
than
yours
canny
lad
she
answered
with
a
mocking
laugh
kit
felt
embarrassed
for
he
thought
he
saw
what
she
meant
janet
bell
was
something
of
a
coquette
i
heard
people
coming
down
the
road
not
long
since
she
resumed
have
you
had
a
supper
party
tell
your
father
i
think
he
shabby
because
he
left
me
out
it
was
a
supper
party
and
there
were
no
women
three
or
four
neighbors
came
in
to
grumble
about
the
weather
or
argue
about
the
sheep
they
did
grumble
about
the
weather
kit
replied
janet
looked
amused
you
very
cautious
my
lad
but
you
need
take
it
for
granted
i
always
on
father
side
do
you
think
i
do
know
why
your
neighbors
came
you
do
know
altogether
the
moonlight
was
clear
enough
to
show
that
janet
colored
and
you
think
i
stopped
you
to
find
out
i
do
said
kit
rather
awkwardly
still
perhaps
it
better
that
you
should
know
oh
said
she
with
some
emotion
i
ca
tell
if
you
mean
to
be
nice
or
not
it
the
lazy
feckless
people
who
dislike
father
because
they
jealous
and
they
try
to
make
things
hard
for
me
why
should
i
suffer
because
he
cleverer
than
them
you
ough
to
suffer
i
really
do
think
people
blame
you
they
do
blame
me
janet
insisted
you
doubted
if
you
could
trust
me
just
now
this
was
true
enough
to
embarrass
kit
but
he
said
i
did
see
why
i
should
talk
to
you
about
our
business
that
was
all
in
fact
i
mean
to
talk
about
it
to
anybody
now
you
nicer
i
did
like
to
feel
you
were
taking
particular
care
not
to
let
me
know
well
of
course
father
no
friend
of
yours
and
perhaps
he
like
you
worse
by
and
by
but
after
all
does
that
matter
not
in
a
way
said
kit
pretending
to
be
dull
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
dispute
and
we
do
want
to
quarrel
with
your
father
although
we
mean
to
carry
out
our
plans
janet
looked
rather
hard
at
him
and
there
was
some
color
in
her
face
but
she
forced
a
smile
oh
well
i
stopped
you
and
expect
you
want
to
get
home
she
went
back
through
the
gate
and
kit
resumed
his
walk
struggling
with
an
annoyance
he
felt
was
illogical
he
knew
something
about
household
and
imagined
that
janet
life
was
not
smooth
he
was
sorry
for
her
and
it
was
of
course
unjust
to
blame
her
for
her
father
deeds
all
the
same
the
favor
she
had
sometimes
shown
him
was
embarrassing
he
was
not
a
philanderer
but
he
was
young
and
she
had
made
him
feel
that
he
had
played
an
ungallant
part
jane
was
a
flirt
but
after
all
it
would
not
have
cost
him
much
so
to
speak
to
play
up
to
her
perhaps
he
had
acted
like
a
prig
this
made
him
angry
although
he
knew
he
had
taken
the
proper
line
by
and
by
he
came
to
the
where
a
beck
crossed
the
road
its
channel
was
paved
so
that
one
could
drive
across
and
at
the
side
a
stone
causeway
had
been
made
for
foot
passengers
sometimes
when
the
beck
was
unusually
swollen
shallow
water
covered
the
stones
and
kit
saw
the
significance
of
a
statement
of
janet
as
he
noted
the
width
of
the
submerged
spot
it
looked
as
if
jim
nixon
had
carried
her
across
then
his
annoyance
vanished
and
he
laughed
gallant
or
not
he
was
satisfied
to
carry
janet
letter
as
he
went
on
in
the
moonlight
he
began
to
see
that
there
were
some
grounds
for
his
reluctance
to
indulge
the
girl
he
had
thought
about
miss
osborn
often
since
he
helped
her
across
the
stepping
stones
he
had
not
hesitated
then
and
although
the
things
were
different
to
dwell
upon
the
incident
was
perhaps
rasher
than
indulging
janet
miss
osborn
had
no
doubt
forgotten
but
he
had
not
the
trouble
was
he
could
not
forget
his
imagination
pictured
her
vividly
sitting
beneath
the
alders
talking
to
him
with
something
of
an
effort
kit
pulled
himself
up
he
was
a
small
farmer
son
and
the
osborns
were
important
people
he
knew
family
pride
which
he
thought
his
daughter
had
inherited
in
osborn
it
was
marked
by
arrogance
in
the
girl
by
a
gracious
calm
for
all
that
the
pride
was
there
and
kit
resolving
that
he
would
not
be
a
fool
went
to
the
post
office
and
put
janet
letter
in
the
box
chapter
iv
the
peat
cutters
osborn
was
dissatisfied
and
moody
when
one
afternoon
he
stood
waiting
for
the
grouse
behind
a
bank
of
turf
on
malton
moor
to
begin
with
he
had
played
cards
until
the
early
morning
with
some
of
his
guests
and
had
been
unlucky
then
he
got
up
with
a
headache
for
which
he
held
his
wife
accountable
alice
was
getting
horribly
parsimonious
and
had
bothered
him
until
he
tried
to
cut
down
his
wine
merchant
bill
by
experimenting
with
cheaper
liquor
his
headache
was
the
consequence
the
whisky
he
had
formerly
kept
never
troubled
him
like
that
moreover
it
was
perhaps
a
mistake
to
invite
jardine
although
he
sometimes
gave
one
a
useful
hint
about
speculations
on
the
stock
exchange
the
fellow
went
to
bigger
shoots
and
looked
bored
when
partridges
were
scarce
and
wild
besides
he
had
broken
rules
in
order
to
get
a
shot
when
they
walked
the
turnip
fields
in
line
osborn
imagined
jardine
would
not
have
done
so
had
he
been
a
guest
at
one
of
the
houses
he
boasted
about
visiting
as
they
climbed
malton
head
another
of
the
party
had
broken
drystone
wall
and
the
farmer
had
said
more
about
the
accident
than
the
damage
justified
in
fact
dowthwaite
was
rather
aggressive
and
now
osborn
came
to
think
of
it
one
or
two
others
had
recently
grumbled
about
things
they
had
hitherto
borne
without
complaint
in
the
meantime
osborn
and
thorn
who
shared
his
butt
looked
about
while
they
waited
for
the
beaters
the
row
of
turf
banks
regularly
spaced
ran
back
to
the
force
crags
at
the
head
of
the
dale
the
red
bloom
of
the
ling
was
fading
from
the
moor
which
had
begun
to
get
brown
sunshine
and
shadow
swept
across
it
and
the
blue
sky
was
dotted
by
flying
clouds
a
keen
wind
swept
the
high
tableland
and
the
grouse
flying
before
it
would
come
over
the
butts
very
fast
in
the
distance
one
could
distinguish
a
row
of
figures
that
were
presently
lost
in
a
hollow
and
got
larger
when
they
reappeared
they
were
beaters
driving
the
grouse
and
by
and
by
osborn
picking
up
his
glasses
saw
clusters
of
small
dark
objects
that
skimmed
and
then
dropped
into
the
heath
it
was
satisfactory
to
note
that
they
were
numerous
although
the
birds
were
rather
wild
he
could
now
give
his
friends
some
sport
after
a
time
however
the
clusters
of
dark
dots
were
seen
first
to
scatter
and
then
vanish
osborn
frowned
as
he
gave
thorn
the
glasses
what
does
that
mean
looks
as
if
the
birds
had
broken
back
some
have
broken
back
said
thorn
if
they
flown
over
the
beaters
we
have
lost
them
for
the
afternoon
he
paused
and
resumed
i
think
the
first
lot
are
dropping
no
they
coming
on
picking
up
his
gun
he
watched
the
advancing
grouse
they
flew
low
but
very
fast
making
a
few
strokes
at
intervals
and
then
sailing
on
stretched
wings
down
the
wind
in
a
few
moments
they
were
large
and
distinct
but
there
were
not
enough
to
cross
more
than
the
first
two
butts
when
they
were
fifty
yards
off
thorn
threw
up
his
gun
and
two
pale
flashes
leaped
out
osborn
was
slower
and
swung
his
barrel
the
sharp
reports
were
echoed
from
the
next
butt
and
a
thin
streak
of
smoke
that
looked
gray
in
the
sunshine
drifted
across
the
bank
of
turf
two
brown
objects
spinning
round
struck
the
heath
and
a
few
light
feathers
followed
the
grouse
that
had
escaped
went
on
and
got
small
again
missed
with
my
right
said
osborn
had
to
shoot
on
the
swing
know
about
the
other
barrel
thorn
did
know
but
used
some
tact
i
may
have
been
a
trifle
slow
my
last
bird
was
going
very
fast
i
expect
you
saw
whose
bird
it
was
osborn
said
to
the
lad
who
took
their
guns
yes
sir
thorn
sir
oh
well
said
osborn
forcing
a
smile
as
he
turned
to
thorn
you
have
youth
upon
your
side
anyhow
i
do
imagine
the
others
have
done
much
better
and
it
looks
as
if
we
might
as
well
go
home
when
the
birds
broke
back
we
lost
the
best
chance
we
get
i
wonder
what
spoiled
the
drive
something
on
the
old
green
road
i
think
the
grouse
turned
as
they
crossed
the
hollow
a
short
distance
off
there
was
a
fold
in
the
moor
and
while
osborn
wondered
whether
he
would
walk
to
the
top
a
man
came
over
the
brow
leading
two
horses
that
hauled
a
clumsy
sledge
another
team
followed
and
presently
four
advanced
across
the
heath
now
you
know
what
spoiled
the
drive
thorn
remarked
with
some
dryness
you
ca
expect
a
good
shoot
on
the
day
your
tenants
move
their
peat
osborn
who
was
very
angry
picked
up
the
glasses
the
first
two
are
not
my
tenants
they
the
askews
and
the
boundary
of
their
sheepwalk
runs
on
this
side
of
the
green
road
then
i
suppose
there
nothing
to
be
said
in
the
meantime
osborn
friends
had
left
the
other
butts
and
come
up
with
jardine
in
front
he
was
a
fat
man
and
as
he
got
nearer
remarked
to
his
companions
i
call
it
wretched
bad
management
somebody
ought
to
have
turned
the
fellows
off
the
moor
osborn
heard
and
glanced
at
thorn
as
he
left
the
butt
there
is
something
to
be
said
i
going
to
relieve
my
mind
he
went
off
and
signaled
the
farmers
to
stop
they
waited
standing
quietly
by
their
horses
on
the
open
moor
their
powerful
figures
had
a
touch
of
grace
and
their
clothes
faded
by
sun
and
rain
harmonized
with
the
color
of
the
heath
peter
askew
brown
face
was
inscrutable
when
he
fixed
his
steady
eyes
on
osborn
you
turned
back
the
grouse
and
spoiled
the
beat
do
you
call
that
sporting
osborn
asked
i
sorry
peter
replied
if
i
kenned
you
were
shooting
mayhappen
we
could
have
put
off
loading
the
peat
you
knew
we
were
shooting
when
you
saw
the
beaters
aw
yis
said
peter
it
was
over
late
then
i
wad
willingly
spoil
any
man
sport
but
we
had
browt
up
eight
horses
and
had
to
get
to
work
you
have
plenty
of
work
at
ashness
it
verra
true
but
the
weather
our
master
and
we
canna
awtogether
do
what
we
like
the
peat
mair
important
than
a
few
brace
of
grouse
important
to
you
osborn
rejoined
but
what
about
me
and
my
friends
one
has
come
from
london
for
a
few
days
sport
then
i
sorry
he
has
lost
the
afternoon
kit
interposed
quietly
but
you
well
know
the
wages
laborers
get
in
the
dale
and
there
are
old
folks
and
some
sick
at
allerby
who
need
a
good
fire
the
winter
hard
and
some
of
the
cottages
are
very
damp
the
farmers
pay
the
wages
none
of
them
make
much
money
they
pay
what
their
rent
allows
i
do
force
up
the
rents
they
fixed
by
the
terms
new
tenants
are
willing
to
offer
when
a
lease
runs
out
that
is
so
kit
agreed
i
do
know
that
my
neighbors
grumble
much
because
the
rule
works
on
your
side
but
peat
is
plentiful
and
we
see
why
it
ca
be
used
when
coal
is
dear
i
imagine
you
can
see
an
opportunity
of
selling
the
right
to
cut
it
osborn
sneered
we
are
willing
to
sell
at
the
buyers
price
anybody
who
ca
pay
may
have
the
peat
for
nothing
none
of
the
day
laborers
has
paid
us
yet
and
none
shall
be
forced
to
pay
osborn
did
not
know
whether
he
could
believe
this
statement
or
not
but
he
said
ironically
then
it
looks
as
if
you
were
generous
however
you
are
not
a
friend
of
my
agent
and
no
doubt
see
a
chance
of
making
trouble
when
you
meddle
with
my
tenants
you
play
a
risky
game
and
they
may
find
they
were
foolish
to
join
you
one
of
the
farmers
who
had
stood
quietly
by
peter
askew
looked
up
with
a
slow
smile
another
face
got
a
little
harder
they
were
seldom
noisily
quarrelsome
but
they
were
stubborn
and
remembered
an
injury
long
peter
however
interposed
we
wo
fratch
there
not
much
in
arguing
you
can
beat
moor
side
o
green
road
good
day
to
you
he
spoke
to
the
horses
and
the
sledge
lurched
forward
with
its
load
the
other
teams
strained
at
the
chains
there
was
a
beat
of
hoofs
and
the
row
of
sledges
moved
noisily
away
osborn
waited
for
a
few
moments
but
his
face
was
very
red
when
he
went
back
to
the
butts
the
farmer
refusal
to
dispute
with
him
was
galling
for
all
that
he
must
try
to
find
his
friends
some
sport
and
after
consulting
with
his
gamekeeper
sent
the
beaters
on
across
the
moor
the
new
drive
was
not
successful
and
in
the
evening
the
party
came
down
the
hill
with
a
very
poor
bag
when
they
reached
the
redmire
wood
osborn
stopped
beside
a
broken
hedge
red
beeches
shone
among
the
yellow
birches
and
dark
firs
the
sun
was
low
and
its
slanting
rays
touched
the
higher
branches
but
the
gaps
between
the
trunks
were
filled
with
shadow
a
few
bent
figures
moved
in
the
gloom
and
osborn
frowned
when
three
or
four
children
came
down
a
drive
dragging
a
heavy
fallen
bough
an
elderly
woman
with
a
sack
upon
her
back
followed
them
slowly
and
it
was
obvious
that
cottagers
from
allerby
were
gathering
fuel
confound
them
this
is
too
much
he
exclaimed
and
beckoned
his
gamekeeper
if
that
is
forsyth
tell
her
to
come
up
the
woman
advanced
and
rested
her
sack
upon
the
hedge
her
wrinkled
face
was
wet
with
sweat
but
she
did
not
look
alarmed
eh
she
said
sticks
is
heavy
and
i
none
so
young
as
i
was
you
have
no
business
in
the
wood
said
osborn
sternly
there
nea
place
else
where
we
can
pick
up
sticks
that
is
your
affair
you
know
you
not
allowed
to
gather
wood
in
my
plantations
we
canna
gan
withoot
some
kindling
when
you
canna
keep
it
dry
peat
is
ill
to
light
terrible
messy
stuff
too
and
mak
nea
end
o
dirt
the
children
came
up
and
when
they
stood
gazing
at
the
party
one
of
the
sportsmen
laughed
then
burn
coal
and
the
dirt
wo
bother
you
osborn
rejoined
hoo
can
we
burn
coal
the
woman
asked
noo
tom
bell
has
lease
o
baith
yards
he
putten
up
t
price
and
when
you
paid
what
he
asking
there
nowt
left
for
meal
i
canna
work
for
osborn
as
i
used
and
with
oad
jim
yearning
nobbut
fifteen
shilling
she
paused
for
breath
and
wiped
her
hot
face
and
osborn
signed
to
the
keeper
the
woman
was
making
him
ridiculous
turn
them
all
out
holliday
he
said
and
went
on
with
his
friends
the
old
lady
talkative
one
remarked
quite
frank
but
not
at
all
angry
i
thought
her
line
was
rather
dignified
i
met
country
folks
who
have
been
servilely
apologetic
and
some
who
would
have
called
you
ugly
names
these
people
are
never
apologetic
osborn
said
dryly
as
a
rule
they
not
truculent
but
they
devilish
obstinate
i
think
i
see
after
all
it
possible
to
stick
to
your
point
without
abusing
your
antagonist
i
suppose
you
turned
them
out
because
of
the
pheasants
yes
good
cover
scarce
and
if
the
birds
are
disturbed
they
move
down
to
rafton
woods
for
a
sporting
neighbor
hayton
hardly
plays
the
game
to
put
down
corn
is
of
course
allowable
but
he
uses
damaged
raisins
then
you
do
feed
very
little
osborn
replied
corn
too
dear
the
tarnside
pheasants
live
on
the
country
i
expect
that
really
means
they
live
on
the
farmers
osborn
frowned
it
was
jardine
habit
to
make
stupid
remarks
like
that
osborn
wondered
whether
the
fellow
thought
them
smart
the
farmers
knew
my
rules
when
they
signed
the
lease
he
said
anyhow
pheasants
do
much
less
damage
than
ground
game
and
i
do
think
my
tenants
have
left
a
hare
in
the
dale
jardine
began
to
talk
about
something
else
and
no
more
was
said
about
osborn
grievances
until
the
party
met
on
the
new
terrace
in
the
twilight
the
tarn
glimmered
with
faint
reflections
from
the
west
but
thin
mist
drifted
across
the
pastures
and
the
hills
rose
vague
and
black
against
the
sky
in
which
a
half
moon
shone
osborn
sitting
at
the
top
of
the
shallow
steps
that
went
down
to
the
lawn
grumbled
to
his
wife
about
the
day
shooting
i
do
think
i
an
exacting
landlord
he
remarked
in
fact
since
i
ask
for
nothing
but
a
little
it
annoying
when
people
spoil
my
sport
dowthwaite
made
himself
unpleasant
about
his
broken
wall
the
askews
turned
the
grouse
back
and
then
i
found
the
allerby
cottage
children
ransacking
redmire
wood
when
the
pheasants
were
going
to
roost
grace
who
stood
close
by
with
thorn
indicated
the
smooth
gravel
and
the
low
wall
on
which
red
geraniums
grew
this
she
said
is
a
great
improvement
on
the
old
grass
bank
the
wide
steps
and
broad
slate
coping
have
an
artistic
effect
however
you
often
get
the
things
you
like
without
paying
very
true
but
rather
trite
osborn
agreed
i
do
see
how
it
applies
well
i
really
sympathetic
about
your
spoiled
day
but
it
looks
as
if
all
your
disappointments
sprang
from
the
same
cause
ah
said
osborn
sharply
i
suppose
you
mean
the
coal
yards
lease
i
think
i
mean
bell
greediness
if
he
did
charge
so
much
for
his
coal
askew
would
not
have
cut
the
peat
and
the
children
would
not
have
been
sent
to
gather
wood
then
dowthwaite
might
not
have
grumbled
about
his
wall
he
feels
the
farmers
have
not
been
treated
justly
and
i
imagine
he
blames
you
osborn
knitted
his
brows
then
it
an
example
of
the
attitude
he
and
one
or
two
others
are
treated
better
than
they
deserve
and
would
not
be
satisfied
with
anything
i
did
if
you
had
to
manage
the
estate
pay
extortionate
taxes
and
make
the
unnecessary
repairs
the
farmers
demand
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
the
line
you
would
take
perhaps
the
right
line
is
easy
grace
admitted
still
if
i
wanted
a
guide
there
the
motto
of
our
county
town
just
and
fear
not
osborn
looked
at
her
with
indignant
surprise
and
then
shrugged
scornfully
thorn
smiled
it
an
excellent
motto
but
they
chose
it
some
time
since
one
imagines
it
out
of
date
now
grace
colored
and
moved
away
feeling
embarrassed
she
had
made
herself
ridiculous
and
perhaps
sentiment
such
as
she
had
indulged
was
cheap
but
it
hurt
to
feel
that
she
so
to
speak
stood
alone
although
she
had
no
doubt
been
imprudent
she
had
said
what
she
felt
and
thorn
had
smiled
she
turned
to
him
angrily
when
he
followed
her
along
the
terrace
i
daresay
i
am
a
raw
sentimentalist
but
i
glad
i
not
up
to
date
she
said
i
hate
your
modern
smartness
thorn
noting
the
hardness
of
her
voice
stopped
with
an
apologetic
gesture
and
let
her
go
chapter
v
railton
tally
winter
had
begun
and
although
the
briars
shone
red
along
the
hedgerows
and
the
stunted
oaks
had
not
lost
all
their
leaves
bitter
sleet
blew
across
the
dale
when
grace
went
up
the
muddy
lonning
to
mireside
farm
railton
daughter
had
for
a
time
helped
the
housekeeper
at
tarnside
and
grace
hearing
that
the
farmer
had
been
ill
was
going
to
ask
about
him
it
was
nearly
dark
when
she
entered
the
big
kitchen
the
lamp
had
not
been
lighted
but
a
peat
fire
burned
in
the
wide
grate
where
irons
for
cooking
pots
hung
above
the
blaze
a
bright
glow
leaped
up
and
spread
about
the
kitchen
touching
the
people
in
the
room
and
then
faded
as
she
shut
the
massive
door
grace
thought
her
arrival
had
embarrassed
the
others
because
nobody
said
anything
for
a
moment
or
two
railton
sat
in
an
old
oak
chair
by
the
fire
with
a
stick
near
his
hand
tom
the
shepherd
occupied
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
kit
askew
leaned
against
the
table
at
which
railton
and
lucy
sat
grace
wished
she
could
see
them
better
but
the
blaze
had
sunk
and
the
fire
burned
low
giving
out
an
aromatic
smell
and
throwing
dull
reflections
on
the
old
oak
furniture
copper
kettles
and
tall
brass
candlesticks
as
a
rule
the
lonely
homesteads
in
the
dales
are
furnished
well
with
objects
made
long
since
and
handed
down
from
father
to
son
then
railton
began
to
talk
rather
nervously
and
grace
turned
to
the
farmer
as
the
light
spread
about
the
room
again
he
had
a
thin
lined
face
his
shoulders
were
bent
and
his
pose
was
slack
sickness
no
doubt
accounted
for
something
but
grace
imagined
his
attitude
hinted
at
dejection
how
are
you
she
asked
no
varra
weel
i
none
so
young
and
the
wet
and
cold
dinna
agree
with
my
oad
bones
mayhappen
i
be
better
soon
but
noo
when
i
needed
i
canna
get
aboot
he
not
can
rest
railton
interposed
he
was
oot
in
sleet
boddering
among
t
sheep
aw
day
and
weel
you
ken
i
had
to
gan
the
farmer
rejoined
railton
silence
implied
agreement
and
grace
curiosity
was
excited
because
of
something
she
had
heard
at
home
railton
lease
of
the
sheepwalk
ran
out
in
a
few
days
but
he
was
by
local
custom
entitled
to
its
renewal
after
a
review
of
the
terms
moreover
it
was
usual
for
the
tenant
to
take
the
sheep
with
the
farm
and
leave
them
equal
in
number
and
condition
when
he
went
the
landlord
could
then
demand
a
valuation
and
payment
of
the
difference
if
the
flocks
had
fallen
below
the
proper
standard
why
are
you
forced
to
go
out
in
this
bitter
weather
she
asked
railton
hesitated
and
then
saw
his
daughter
meaning
glance
lucy
was
clever
and
he
thought
she
wanted
him
to
be
frank
i
had
to
see
how
sheep
were
he
answered
dully
not
that
it
was
mich
use
t
lambs
niver
get
over
wet
spring
and
t
ewes
is
poor
then
flock
is
weel
under
tally
i
lost
two
score
swinset
herdwicks
and
the
next
thursday
but
how
did
you
lose
forty
sheep
grace
asked
there
was
a
hole
in
fell
dyke
and
swinset
sheep
are
thief
sheep
varra
bad
to
hoad
i
bowt
ewes
there
and
t
lambs
followed
when
they
wandert
back
to
their
heaf
grace
pondered
she
had
noted
some
reserve
in
railton
manner
when
he
mentioned
the
broken
dyke
and
knew
the
flockmasters
were
careful
about
their
dry
walls
the
rest
was
plain
the
is
the
hill
pasture
where
a
lamb
is
born
and
swinset
was
fifteen
miles
away
it
was
a
very
large
sheepwalk
and
much
time
would
be
needed
to
find
the
sheep
on
the
wide
belt
of
moor
if
you
know
the
sheep
are
at
swinset
they
would
be
allowed
for
in
the
count
she
said
i
have
my
doubts
hayes
sent
me
notice
tally
would
be
taken
on
thursday
and
he
a
hard
man
grace
colored
although
she
did
not
like
hayes
he
was
osborn
agent
there
was
much
she
wanted
to
know
but
she
could
not
ask
hayes
can
not
do
exactly
as
he
likes
he
must
get
my
consent
she
said
however
as
i
am
going
home
by
the
field
path
i
had
better
start
before
it
dark
there
a
broken
gate
that
awkward
to
open
i
will
come
with
you
until
you
reach
it
kit
remarked
they
went
out
together
the
sleet
had
stopped
but
leaden
clouds
rolled
across
the
hills
that
glimmered
white
in
the
dusk
as
they
struck
across
a
wet
field
grace
said
i
suppose
railton
flock
is
below
the
proper
standard
and
the
count
is
short
yes
the
two
or
three
wet
years
have
hit
hard
and
railton
had
to
sell
more
stock
than
was
prudent
in
order
to
pay
his
debts
then
if
he
ca
pay
the
difference
in
number
and
value
the
lease
can
be
broken
kit
made
a
sign
of
agreement
and
grace
asked
but
do
you
think
hayes
would
break
the
lease
and
turn
him
out
it
possible
kit
answered
cautiously
grace
gave
him
a
sharp
glance
what
do
you
really
think
askew
i
want
to
know
then
my
notion
is
hayes
would
like
to
get
mireside
for
jim
richardson
richardson
is
his
nephew
just
so
said
kit
with
some
dryness
all
the
same
he
make
a
good
tenant
his
father
is
rich
enough
to
start
him
well
grace
eyes
sparkled
for
she
saw
where
the
hint
led
but
she
hid
her
resentment
because
after
all
she
had
doubts
osborn
needed
money
and
hayes
was
cunning
i
imagine
it
would
hurt
railton
to
leave
it
would
hurt
him
much
he
was
born
at
mireside
and
his
father
took
the
farm
from
your
grandfather
a
very
long
time
since
then
he
an
old
man
and
has
not
enough
money
to
begin
again
at
another
place
ah
said
grace
it
would
be
very
hard
if
he
had
to
go
but
if
he
has
money
he
could
carry
on
even
if
we
renewed
the
lease
we
have
had
remarkably
bad
weather
for
two
or
three
years
and
the
cold
rain
killed
the
young
lambs
but
a
change
is
due
a
dry
spring
and
fine
summer
would
put
the
old
man
straight
grace
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
then
looked
at
kit
with
some
color
in
her
face
thank
you
for
making
the
situation
plain
you
were
not
anxious
to
do
so
were
you
i
think
you
do
trust
us
i
do
trust
hayes
kit
said
awkwardly
but
hayes
is
our
agent
we
are
accountable
for
what
he
does
in
a
way
i
suppose
you
are
accountable
for
all
that
when
a
landlord
has
a
capable
agent
it
is
not
the
rule
for
him
to
meddle
i
understand
osborn
leaves
much
to
hayes
grace
pondered
kit
embarrassment
indicated
that
he
was
trying
to
save
her
feelings
but
he
must
know
as
she
knew
that
a
landlord
was
rightly
judged
by
his
agent
deeds
although
she
rather
liked
kit
askew
he
had
humiliated
her
well
she
said
resolutely
something
must
be
done
if
the
strayed
sheep
could
be
found
it
would
help
yes
said
kit
tom
and
i
start
for
swinset
to
try
to
bring
them
back
but
if
you
wait
a
moment
i
open
the
gate
he
walked
through
the
mud
the
cattle
had
churned
up
and
lifting
the
broken
gate
pushed
it
back
so
that
grace
could
cross
a
drier
spot
then
as
he
stood
with
his
hands
on
the
rotten
bars
she
stopped
do
start
for
swinset
until
you
hear
from
me
she
said
thank
you
good
night
grace
went
on
and
kit
turned
back
to
the
farm
with
a
satisfaction
that
made
his
heart
beat
in
a
way
the
girl
had
given
him
her
confidence
she
had
at
least
not
hidden
her
feelings
her
proud
calm
was
only
on
the
surface
it
covered
a
generous
impulsive
nature
then
she
had
pluck
because
he
could
understand
her
difficulties
she
was
loyal
to
her
father
but
hated
injustice
and
was
quickly
moved
to
sympathy
all
the
same
he
had
noted
that
when
she
spoke
of
osborn
renewing
the
lease
she
said
we
and
since
he
knew
why
she
had
done
so
it
gave
him
cause
to
think
it
was
the
code
of
the
old
school
the
family
stood
together
a
compact
unit
to
which
she
belonged
and
for
whose
deeds
she
believed
herself
accountable
in
a
sense
this
was
rather
fine
but
kit
knowing
pride
saw
it
would
confine
their
friendship
to
narrow
limits
still
he
had
no
ground
for
imagining
she
was
his
friend
and
he
tried
to
fix
his
thoughts
upon
the
search
for
the
sheep
grace
obviously
meant
to
talk
to
osborn
but
kit
did
not
believe
the
latter
would
be
moved
by
her
arguments
when
kit
returned
to
the
farm
kitchen
railton
was
sitting
moodily
by
the
fire
and
his
wife
face
was
sternly
set
they
are
not
an
emotional
people
in
the
dales
and
her
trouble
was
too
deep
for
useless
tears
but
as
she
glanced
about
the
room
all
she
saw
wakened
poignant
memories
the
old
china
in
the
rack
had
been
her
mother
she
had
brought
it
and
the
black
oak
to
mireside
thirty
years
since
the
copper
kettles
and
were
wedding
presents
and
tom
her
son
who
died
in
australia
had
sent
the
money
to
buy
the
sewing
machine
now
it
looked
as
if
her
household
treasures
must
be
sold
and
to
leave
mireside
would
mean
the
tearing
up
of
roots
that
had
struck
deep
besides
while
she
would
suffer
it
would
hurt
her
husband
worse
when
kit
came
in
she
gave
him
a
keen
glance
weel
what
had
miss
osborn
to
say
she
did
say
much
i
think
she
means
to
talk
to
osborn
railton
looked
up
gloomily
t
lass
has
a
good
heart
but
talking
to
osborn
will
be
o
nea
use
hayes
is
real
master
and
he
wants
mireside
for
jim
richardson
kit
made
a
sign
of
agreement
the
fellow
getting
dangerous
and
must
be
stopped
i
suspect
he
backing
bell
and
now
he
means
to
use
his
nephew
it
not
altogether
for
richardson
sake
he
wants
to
break
your
lease
some
day
i
imagine
osborn
will
find
his
agent
owns
the
estate
but
not
our
business
well
peter
told
me
to
remind
you
that
you
and
he
are
old
friends
and
if
a
hundred
pounds
would
be
some
help
it
would
be
a
big
help
said
railton
and
kit
turned
to
the
shepherd
when
railton
awkwardly
began
to
thank
him
about
the
broken
dyke
tom
what
think
brought
it
down
i
canna
tell
dyke
good
and
there
was
nea
wind
they
were
all
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
then
kit
said
well
richardson
is
a
cunning
hound
he
paused
and
picked
up
his
hat
before
he
turned
to
railton
i
a
job
at
ashness
that
must
be
finished
there
not
much
time
but
if
it
possible
tom
and
i
will
find
the
sheep
in
the
meantime
grace
walked
home
thinking
hard
kit
was
friend
but
he
had
used
some
tact
until
she
forced
him
to
tell
her
the
truth
this
however
was
not
important
because
she
had
got
a
jar
it
looked
as
if
osborn
had
consented
to
a
cruel
plot
a
landlord
ought
to
help
his
tenants
and
not
take
advantage
of
their
need
she
tried
not
to
blame
him
he
had
a
bad
agent
who
used
a
dangerous
influence
she
must
try
to
protect
him
from
the
fellow
and
in
a
way
from
his
own
carelessness
after
all
it
was
for
the
most
part
carelessness
because
he
did
not
know
hayes
as
she
knew
him
still
she
had
not
undertaken
an
easy
thing
and
she
braced
herself
as
she
went
up
the
steps
of
the
new
terrace
grace
hated
the
terrace
it
was
the
price
they
the
osborns
had
taken
for
a
shabby
deed
and
for
which
poor
people
and
women
paid
grace
knew
about
the
extra
dust
that
peat
fires
caused
and
how
often
the
bread
was
spoiled
when
she
entered
the
library
osborn
was
studying
some
documents
he
looked
up
impatiently
and
she
said
i
was
at
mireside
railton
no
better
and
is
much
disturbed
about
his
lease
not
more
disturbed
than
he
deserves
osborn
rejoined
the
fellow
has
been
getting
slack
for
some
time
he
sold
his
store
sheep
imprudently
and
let
the
flock
run
down
he
has
been
ill
and
the
weather
has
been
bad
for
some
years
exactly
a
cautious
man
provides
for
bad
years
he
knows
they
will
come
grace
was
surprised
her
father
did
not
see
that
his
statement
had
a
humorous
touch
since
improvident
extravagance
was
his
rule
but
it
was
obvious
that
he
did
not
one
can
not
save
much
money
when
rents
are
high
and
prices
are
low
do
you
know
much
about
these
matters
osborn
asked
i
have
heard
the
farmers
talk
sometimes
i
ask
them
questions
osborn
frowned
you
talk
too
much
to
the
farmers
i
do
like
it
you
know
this
well
said
grace
i
think
you
ought
not
to
break
railton
lease
why
grace
hesitated
she
began
to
see
that
osborn
could
not
be
moved
but
she
had
undertaken
to
plead
railton
cause
he
an
old
man
and
has
been
at
mireside
all
his
life
he
has
worked
hard
and
always
paid
his
rent
now
he
ill
and
in
trouble
it
would
be
shabby
to
turn
him
out
because
there
a
risk
it
only
a
risk
that
we
might
lose
something
by
letting
him
stay
you
do
seem
to
understand
a
landlord
duty
osborn
rejoined
he
is
so
to
speak
the
steward
in
charge
of
the
estate
it
belongs
to
the
family
and
is
not
his
he
must
hand
it
on
in
good
order
and
this
means
he
can
not
indulge
his
sentimental
impulses
if
he
keeps
a
bad
tenant
from
pity
or
because
he
afraid
to
seem
harsh
he
robs
his
heir
grace
knew
there
were
other
and
perhaps
worse
ways
of
robbing
heir
but
she
said
are
you
taking
hayes
view
that
railton
is
a
bad
tenant
after
all
we
are
responsible
then
you
suggest
that
hayes
is
mistaken
osborn
asked
ironically
i
do
know
if
he
mistaken
or
not
said
grace
with
a
steady
look
i
know
he
greedy
and
unjust
but
there
a
thing
you
ought
not
to
let
him
do
railton
has
lost
forty
sheep
that
have
strayed
back
to
swinset
and
hayes
does
mean
to
count
them
in
the
tally
osborn
face
got
red
and
he
knitted
his
brows
i
have
tried
to
be
patient
but
this
is
too
much
do
you
know
more
about
managing
an
estate
than
a
clever
agent
or
do
you
think
i
a
fool
and
hayes
leads
me
like
a
child
anyhow
you
are
much
too
young
to
criticize
my
actions
let
us
have
no
more
of
it
an
unmarried
girl
is
not
entitled
to
opinions
that
clash
with
her
parents
grace
went
out
silently
to
know
that
she
had
failed
hurt
her
pride
and
it
hurt
worse
to
suspect
that
her
father
had
got
angry
because
he
knew
she
was
right
besides
she
felt
strangely
alone
as
she
had
often
felt
since
she
came
home
gerald
was
careless
and
thought
about
nothing
but
his
extravagant
amusements
her
mother
main
object
was
to
avoid
jars
and
smooth
over
awkward
situations
then
she
had
household
cares
money
was
scarce
and
since
osborn
hated
she
must
economize
grace
could
not
tell
her
her
troubles
but
there
was
a
way
by
which
railton
might
save
his
lease
and
kit
could
help
getting
a
pencil
and
paper
she
wrote
him
a
very
short
note
you
must
find
railton
sheep
then
knowing
that
she
was
rash
she
went
to
look
for
the
gardener
boy
and
sent
him
to
ashness
chapter
vi
bleatarn
ghyll
it
was
getting
dark
when
kit
and
tom
the
shepherd
stopped
to
rest
behind
a
cairn
on
the
summit
of
swinset
moor
close
by
the
two
score
sheep
stood
in
a
compact
flock
with
heads
towards
the
panting
dogs
they
were
herdwicks
a
small
hardy
breed
that
best
withstands
the
rain
and
snow
that
sweep
the
high
fells
in
the
lambing
season
when
he
had
lighted
his
pipe
kit
thoughtfully
looked
about
on
one
side
the
barren
moor
getting
dim
in
the
distance
rolled
back
to
the
edge
of
the
low
country
here
and
there
patches
of
melting
sleet
gleamed
a
livid
white
among
the
withered
ling
and
hummocks
of
peaty
soil
shone
dark
these
were
the
only
touches
of
color
in
the
dreary
landscape
except
for
the
streak
of
sky
that
glimmered
above
a
long
black
ridge
on
the
other
side
a
line
of
rugged
fells
with
summits
lost
in
snow
clouds
rose
dark
and
forbidding
it
was
very
cold
and
a
biting
wind
swept
the
heath
kit
was
tired
for
he
had
been
on
the
moor
since
morning
and
had
not
eaten
much
it
was
an
awkward
matter
to
find
the
sheep
and
then
the
men
and
dogs
had
some
difficulty
to
keep
the
ewes
moving
because
the
herdwick
never
willingly
leaves
the
neighborhood
where
it
was
born
and
will
if
possible
return
the
lambs
now
grown
large
and
fat
gave
less
trouble
and
when
they
sometimes
stopped
irresolutely
while
the
ewes
tried
to
break
away
kit
understood
their
hesitation
two
instincts
were
at
work
it
was
natural
to
follow
their
dams
but
mireside
was
their
native
heath
and
they
knew
they
were
going
to
be
taken
home
now
they
had
gone
some
distance
kit
had
to
make
a
choice
one
could
reach
mireside
by
a
rough
road
but
it
went
round
the
hills
and
there
was
a
shorter
way
across
the
range
if
he
went
round
he
might
arrive
late
for
the
reckoning
and
some
of
the
lambs
would
get
footsore
and
stop
on
the
other
hand
he
knew
the
fells
and
shrank
from
trying
to
find
his
way
among
the
crags
in
the
dark
it
was
however
important
that
he
should
not
be
late
hayes
was
hard
and
the
herdwicks
must
arrive
in
time
to
be
tallied
with
the
rest
of
railton
flock
in
the
dale
a
tenant
had
a
traditional
right
to
have
his
sheep
valued
by
a
jury
of
his
neighbors
and
hayes
had
fixed
the
time
at
eight
next
day
the
animals
however
must
be
sorted
and
penned
before
this
and
the
work
would
begin
early
in
the
morning
we
had
better
try
the
fells
tom
said
kit
the
shepherd
looked
at
the
threatening
sky
and
fading
line
of
rugged
heights
aw
yes
it
gan
t
be
a
rough
neet
but
we
try
we
can
rest
a
bit
at
oad
this
side
bleatarn
ghyll
now
their
route
was
fixed
kit
mused
about
something
else
railton
was
his
neighbor
but
except
for
this
kit
had
no
particular
grounds
for
helping
him
he
had
obviously
nothing
to
gain
then
the
was
his
plan
he
had
without
altogether
meaning
to
do
so
allowed
himself
to
become
the
leader
of
the
revolt
against
osborn
in
a
way
of
course
he
was
the
proper
man
because
ashness
belonged
to
his
father
and
hayes
could
not
punish
him
for
meddling
still
hayes
could
punish
the
tenant
farmers
and
kit
knew
they
ran
some
risk
on
the
whole
he
thought
the
risk
worth
while
he
had
a
talent
that
was
beginning
to
develop
for
leading
and
saw
when
one
could
negotiate
and
when
one
must
fight
he
did
not
want
to
fight
osborn
but
was
being
forced
into
the
conflict
and
it
was
comforting
to
feel
that
miss
osborn
was
not
against
him
her
note
telling
him
he
must
find
the
sheep
was
in
his
pocket
and
he
thought
it
had
cost
her
something
to
write
she
was
generous
and
plucky
and
he
must
not
hesitate
after
all
the
job
was
his
and
since
he
had
accepted
it
he
must
if
needful
bear
the
consequences
knocking
out
his
pipe
he
got
up
we
make
a
start
tom
he
said
the
shepherd
shouted
to
the
dogs
the
flock
broke
up
and
trailed
out
across
the
heath
the
ewes
moved
slowly
turning
now
and
then
and
kit
thought
it
ominous
that
they
met
other
flocks
coming
down
the
herdwicks
knew
the
weather
and
were
heading
for
the
sheltered
dales
for
all
that
he
pushed
on
with
a
bitter
wind
in
his
face
and
by
and
by
cold
rain
began
to
fall
it
changed
to
sleet
and
the
night
had
got
very
dark
when
they
crossed
the
shoulder
of
a
stony
fell
one
could
not
see
fifty
yards
but
the
steepness
of
the
slope
and
the
click
of
little
hoofs
on
the
wet
rock
told
kit
where
they
were
two
hours
afterwards
he
stopped
for
breath
at
the
bottom
of
a
narrow
valley
the
sleet
had
turned
to
driving
snow
the
wind
howled
in
the
rocks
above
and
a
swollen
beck
brawled
angrily
among
the
stones
tom
was
hardly
distinguishable
a
few
yards
ahead
and
kit
could
not
see
the
sheep
but
the
barking
of
the
dogs
came
faintly
down
the
steep
white
slope
the
herdwicks
were
strung
out
along
the
hillside
with
a
dog
below
and
above
and
it
was
comforting
to
know
they
could
not
leave
the
valley
which
was
shut
in
by
rugged
crags
for
a
time
driving
them
would
be
easy
but
it
would
be
different
when
they
left
the
water
and
climbed
the
rise
to
bleatarn
ghyll
how
far
are
we
off
the
tom
he
shouted
i
dinna
ken
said
the
shepherd
mayhappen
two
miles
ewes
is
travelling
better
is
leading
them
kit
agreed
and
they
pushed
on
through
the
snow
after
a
time
the
ground
got
steeper
and
when
they
crossed
the
noisy
beck
and
scrambled
up
a
shaly
bank
kit
was
glad
to
see
a
broken
wall
loom
among
the
tossing
flakes
this
was
the
of
an
abandoned
mine
and
there
was
a
built
with
material
close
by
he
shouted
and
waited
until
he
heard
the
dogs
bark
and
a
rattle
of
stones
the
herdwicks
were
coming
down
and
presently
broke
out
from
the
snow
in
a
compact
struggling
flock
tom
shouted
and
threw
a
hurdle
across
the
entrance
when
the
dogs
had
driven
the
sheep
into
the
fold
i
dinna
ken
if
snow
tak
off
or
not
but
it
early
yet
and
we
must
have
a
rest
before
we
try
ghyll
he
said
they
went
into
the
and
kit
struck
a
match
one
end
of
the
building
had
been
pulled
down
and
the
snow
blew
in
through
holes
in
the
roof
but
a
pile
of
dry
fern
filled
a
corner
and
rotten
beams
lay
about
with
some
trouble
they
lighted
a
fire
and
sitting
down
close
by
took
out
the
food
they
had
brought
the
wind
screamed
about
the
ruined
walls
the
smoke
eddied
round
them
and
now
and
then
a
shower
of
snow
fell
on
their
heads
but
they
had
some
shelter
and
could
if
forced
wait
for
morning
miss
osborn
a
bonny
lass
and
kind
but
i
reckon
she
could
talk
her
father
round
tom
presently
remarked
no
said
kit
i
believe
she
tried
favors
her
mother
tom
resumed
osborn
heart
is
good
but
at
tarnside
women
dinna
count
it
a
kind
o
pity
because
t
osborn
menfolk
are
lakers
and
always
was
a
is
a
lounging
and
kit
admitted
that
the
remark
was
justified
i
sometimes
think
osborn
means
well
he
said
mayhappen
for
aw
his
ordering
folks
aboot
he
wake
like
his
father
i
mind
him
weel
might
mak
a
fair
landlord
if
he
was
letten
and
had
money
but
oad
hayes
is
grasping
and
always
at
his
tail
the
good
the
estate
could
be
managed
well
there
t
mortgages
and
osborn
canna
keep
money
when
he
has
it
he
must
spend
there
would
be
nea
poor
landlord
if
i
had
my
way
i
let
them
putten
rents
up
if
they
had
money
and
spent
it
on
the
land
low
rent
means
poor
farming
kit
knew
this
was
true
on
the
tarnside
estate
dykes
that
had
kept
the
floods
off
the
meadows
were
falling
down
drains
were
choked
and
land
that
had
grown
good
crops
was
going
sour
the
wise
use
of
capital
would
make
a
wholesome
change
but
kit
did
not
altogether
like
centralized
control
although
it
was
economical
the
landlord
got
the
main
advantage
and
there
was
much
a
farmer
could
do
in
cooperation
with
his
neighbors
to
help
himself
if
his
lease
was
long
enough
then
joint
action
was
once
common
in
the
dale
men
pooled
their
labor
and
implements
at
hay
time
and
harvest
and
combined
for
their
mutual
benefit
in
other
ways
now
it
looked
as
if
they
might
combine
again
are
they
grumbling
much
at
allerby
about
burning
peat
he
asked
t
women
grumble
tom
said
dryly
but
they
willunt
stop
for
aw
the
dirt
peat
maks
an
they
canna
get
ovens
hot
i
reckon
bell
has
mair
coal
coming
in
than
he
can
get
shut
of
when
i
was
at
station
last
t
yards
was
nearly
full
i
rather
think
bell
has
been
too
greedy
he
must
pay
for
the
coal
as
it
arrives
and
his
money
is
probably
getting
short
the
traction
engine
and
trailer
cost
a
good
sum
and
he
has
spent
something
on
the
in
fact
if
we
hold
on
he
bound
to
give
way
then
we
brek
him
our
folks
are
slow
to
fratch
but
they
not
quick
at
letting
go
said
tom
who
paused
and
added
i
wunner
where
bell
got
his
money
he
had
none
when
he
took
a
job
at
mill
in
oad
osborn
time
this
started
kit
on
another
line
of
thought
bell
had
no
doubt
saved
something
for
he
was
parsimonious
and
was
too
keen
a
business
man
to
leave
his
money
in
the
bank
all
he
made
by
one
speculation
was
sunk
in
another
but
after
allowing
for
this
it
was
hard
to
see
where
he
got
the
capital
for
his
numerous
ventures
kit
wondered
whether
hayes
helped
if
he
did
it
was
not
from
friendship
the
agent
was
clever
and
might
be
playing
a
cunning
game
in
which
he
used
both
osborn
and
bell
in
fact
kit
thought
if
he
were
osborn
he
would
watch
hayes
this
however
was
not
his
business
and
getting
up
he
went
to
a
hole
in
the
wall
it
was
snowing
very
hard
he
could
see
nothing
but
a
haze
of
tossing
flakes
and
the
wind
filled
the
valley
with
its
roar
he
could
hardly
hear
the
beck
a
few
yards
off
the
drifts
will
be
getting
deep
but
we
ca
start
yet
he
said
if
we
miss
the
track
at
the
top
there
nothing
to
stop
us
falling
over
the
ling
crag
tom
agreed
and
kit
shivered
when
he
sat
down
again
he
was
cold
and
tired
and
the
worst
part
of
the
journey
must
yet
be
made
looking
at
his
watch
he
resigned
himself
to
wait
and
leaned
back
with
eyes
closed
against
the
wall
while
a
wet
dog
crouched
at
his
feet
an
hour
or
two
passed
and
then
tom
got
up
snow
takin
off
he
said
we
must
try
it
kit
pulling
himself
together
went
out
and
faced
the
storm
the
snow
was
thinner
but
the
wind
had
not
dropped
and
buffeted
him
savagely
as
he
struggled
through
a
drift
to
the
fold
the
dogs
had
some
trouble
to
drive
out
the
sheep
and
when
they
straggled
through
the
opening
kit
imagined
the
lambs
went
in
front
in
a
few
moments
the
flock
vanished
and
he
breathed
hard
as
he
followed
their
track
up
hill
now
and
then
the
dogs
barked
but
for
the
most
part
he
heard
nothing
except
the
roar
of
the
wind
in
the
crags
he
hoped
the
dogs
could
find
the
path
across
the
narrow
tableland
between
two
branching
ghylls
because
it
was
obvious
that
his
judgment
might
be
at
fault
however
there
were
the
lambs
one
could
trust
a
herdwick
to
return
to
its
heaf
when
he
reached
the
top
the
wind
had
blown
away
the
snow
and
he
stood
near
the
middle
of
a
narrow
belt
of
heath
with
his
feet
sinking
in
a
bog
on
each
side
he
got
a
glimpse
of
dark
rocks
streaked
with
white
where
the
wind
had
packed
the
snow
into
the
gullies
in
front
there
was
a
gulf
down
which
his
path
led
scattered
snowflakes
and
rolling
mist
streamed
up
from
the
forbidding
hollow
at
first
he
could
see
nothing
of
the
sheep
but
as
he
floundered
across
the
bog
the
dogs
barked
and
he
found
them
presently
guarding
the
flock
in
a
hollow
among
the
crags
the
sheep
broke
away
and
kit
pushed
on
across
the
narrow
belt
of
bog
that
was
dotted
by
the
marks
of
little
feet
sometimes
he
slackened
his
pace
to
wait
for
tom
the
shepherd
was
getting
old
and
the
long
climb
had
tired
him
both
stopped
for
some
moments
when
they
reached
the
brow
of
the
descent
and
kit
bracing
himself
against
the
storm
tried
to
look
about
he
thought
he
saw
the
flock
close
in
front
they
seem
doubtful
where
to
go
he
said
we
can
do
nowt
but
leave
them
to
find
t
ghyll
the
shepherd
remarked
kit
agreed
bleatarn
ghyll
was
beneath
him
but
there
was
another
hollow
and
it
is
hard
to
walk
straight
down
hill
in
the
dark
he
must
trust
the
sheep
and
huddling
close
together
they
refused
to
leave
the
crag
when
the
dogs
drove
them
out
they
vanished
and
since
the
ground
was
bare
of
snow
they
left
no
tracks
he
stumbled
on
falling
into
pools
and
stumbling
across
banks
of
stones
and
soon
stopped
again
he
had
come
down
the
slope
so
to
speak
blindly
and
now
stood
on
the
edge
of
a
vast
dark
pit
one
could
not
see
beyond
the
edge
but
the
confused
noises
that
came
up
hinted
at
profound
depth
the
gale
shrieked
but
he
heard
the
roar
of
falling
water
and
the
rattle
of
stones
the
wind
dislodged
do
you
think
this
is
beatarn
ghyll
he
asked
i
dinna
ken
tom
answered
and
added
hopefully
if
it
mayhappen
find
oot
before
we
step
over
ling
crag
they
went
down
at
a
venture
whistling
vainly
for
the
dogs
the
drop
was
very
sharp
and
now
they
were
leaving
the
pass
the
snow
had
begun
to
pack
among
the
stones
and
boggy
grass
still
so
far
as
they
could
see
there
were
no
marks
of
little
feet
and
they
wondered
what
had
happened
to
the
flock
until
a
faint
bark
came
out
of
the
mist
the
noise
got
louder
and
kit
knew
the
dogs
were
running
round
the
stopping
sheep
we
right
he
said
they
gone
through
the
broken
wall
and
the
dogs
are
holding
them
at
the
top
of
the
force
a
few
minutes
afterwards
he
scrambled
over
a
pile
of
fallen
stones
shouted
to
tom
and
began
to
run
for
he
understood
what
had
happened
the
broken
wall
marked
the
boundary
of
the
mireside
heaf
and
the
sheep
were
now
on
familiar
ground
it
was
his
business
to
drive
them
to
the
farm
but
they
were
trying
to
turn
off
to
look
for
shelter
among
the
crags
at
the
force
where
the
bleatarn
beck
leaps
in
linked
falls
to
the
valley
one
could
get
down
between
the
water
and
the
rocks
on
the
other
side
a
path
about
a
foot
wide
led
across
the
face
of
a
precipice
in
daylight
if
the
stones
were
dry
a
man
with
steady
nerves
could
use
the
path
but
when
slab
and
scree
were
packed
with
snow
nothing
but
a
herdwick
could
cross
it
safely
the
dogs
knew
this
and
were
trying
to
hold
the
flock
when
the
men
came
up
they
saw
an
indistinct
woolly
mass
on
the
other
side
of
the
beck
the
mass
was
not
level
but
slanted
sharply
and
the
sheep
at
the
bottom
sent
down
showers
of
stones
as
they
surged
to
and
fro
with
heads
turned
to
the
dogs
it
was
obvious
that
they
did
not
mean
to
go
down
the
ghyll
and
herdwicks
born
among
the
crags
can
climb
where
no
dog
can
follow
the
dogs
canna
turn
them
gasped
tom
they
be
away
ower
eel
scar
they
brekkin
noo
the
flock
began
to
open
out
and
three
or
four
sheep
straggled
forward
but
kit
dog
slid
down
a
snowy
slab
and
fell
upon
the
first
the
sheep
ran
back
but
the
others
stood
and
kit
saw
the
dog
could
not
stop
them
long
the
herdwicks
knew
the
advantage
was
theirs
on
ground
like
this
jumping
from
a
boulder
he
fell
into
the
swollen
beck
and
made
his
way
up
the
nearly
perpendicular
slab
at
the
top
he
found
a
dangerous
ledge
and
advanced
upon
the
sheep
which
had
their
backs
to
the
stream
twining
his
fingers
in
a
lamb
wool
he
picked
up
the
animal
and
balancing
himself
precariously
threw
it
as
far
as
he
could
it
fell
into
the
beck
and
scrambled
out
on
the
other
side
where
the
track
led
down
the
ghyll
the
effort
had
cost
him
much
for
his
heart
beat
and
he
gasped
for
breath
but
he
doubted
if
he
had
done
enough
dragging
another
lamb
from
the
flock
he
hurled
it
into
the
water
and
then
his
foot
slipped
and
he
rolled
down
the
slab
and
fell
in
the
snow
he
got
up
badly
shaken
and
saw
that
his
plan
had
worked
sheep
will
follow
a
leader
and
the
flock
was
straggling
down
the
ghyll
behind
the
lambs
kit
recrossed
the
beck
and
descended
cautiously
keeping
close
to
the
rocks
the
ghyll
is
a
rough
climb
in
daylight
and
summer
tourists
trying
to
cross
the
fells
often
turn
back
at
the
bottom
there
is
no
path
and
one
scrambles
over
large
sharp
stones
some
of
which
are
loose
and
fall
at
a
touch
in
places
banks
of
treacherous
gravel
drop
to
the
beck
which
plunges
over
ledges
into
deep
pools
now
the
stones
were
slippery
with
snow
the
wind
raged
and
mist
and
tossing
flakes
hid
the
ground
a
few
yards
ahead
somehow
he
got
down
but
he
was
exhausted
and
breathless
when
he
reached
the
bottom
where
he
was
forced
to
wait
before
he
could
whistle
to
his
dog
he
heard
its
bark
and
stumbling
forward
found
the
flock
bunched
together
in
a
hollow
then
he
sat
down
in
the
snow
while
tom
counted
the
sheep
they
aw
here
said
the
shepherd
a
better
job
than
i
thowt
mak
weel
let
gan
on
kit
was
tired
and
bruised
by
his
fall
but
he
went
forward
behind
the
dogs
his
troubles
were
over
for
a
broad
smooth
path
led
along
the
to
mireside
chapter
vii
the
reckoning
the
morning
was
dark
and
although
the
gale
had
dropped
a
raw
cold
wind
blew
up
the
valley
past
mireside
farm
where
three
or
four
traps
and
some
rusty
bicycles
stood
beneath
the
projecting
roof
of
a
barn
the
bleating
of
sheep
rose
from
a
boggy
pasture
by
the
beck
and
lights
twinkled
as
men
with
lanterns
moved
about
in
the
gloom
now
and
then
somebody
shouted
and
dogs
barked
as
a
flock
of
herdwicks
was
driven
to
the
pens
in
the
flagged
kitchen
railton
and
lucy
bustled
about
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
and
the
glow
of
the
fire
the
table
was
covered
with
used
plates
and
cups
the
men
outside
had
breakfasted
but
one
or
two
more
might
come
and
railton
wondered
when
kit
would
arrive
she
had
lain
awake
for
the
most
part
of
the
night
thinking
about
him
and
the
strayed
herdwicks
while
she
listened
to
the
gale
now
and
then
lucy
went
to
the
door
and
looked
up
the
dale
to
the
glimmering
line
of
foam
that
marked
the
spot
where
bleatarn
beck
came
down
a
path
followed
the
but
she
could
not
see
men
or
sheep
in
the
gloom
and
if
kit
did
not
come
soon
he
would
be
too
late
railton
sat
gloomily
by
the
fire
he
had
had
rheumatic
fever
and
the
damp
cold
racked
his
aching
joints
besides
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
he
had
called
in
his
neighbors
to
value
his
flock
but
he
knew
to
a
few
pounds
what
their
judgment
would
be
hayes
would
presently
arrive
and
railton
would
be
asked
to
pay
or
give
security
for
the
shortage
which
was
impossible
hayes
knew
this
and
meant
to
break
his
lease
perhaps
the
hardest
thing
was
that
the
shortage
was
small
if
the
next
lambing
season
were
good
he
could
pay
but
hayes
would
not
wait
although
railton
was
too
proud
to
beg
for
help
from
his
neighbors
he
had
gone
to
the
bank
osborn
however
used
the
same
bank
and
it
looked
as
if
hayes
had
given
the
manager
a
hint
because
he
refused
a
loan
askew
had
offered
a
hundred
pounds
but
this
was
not
enough
and
even
if
kit
arrived
with
the
sheep
from
swinset
railton
could
not
find
the
rest
of
the
money
however
the
arrival
of
the
herdwicks
would
make
a
difference
and
he
did
not
altogether
give
up
hope
by
and
by
he
tried
to
get
up
and
sitting
down
again
with
a
groan
beckoned
his
wife
martha
you
might
gan
to
door
railton
knowing
what
he
meant
went
to
the
porch
it
was
lighter
outside
and
the
hillside
was
growing
distinct
she
thought
something
moved
on
the
path
beside
the
beck
and
turned
to
her
daughter
who
had
followed
what
yon
by
the
water
lucy
lucy
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
then
said
quietly
i
think
it
sheep
she
watched
the
path
the
mist
made
a
puzzling
background
and
her
eyes
were
getting
dazzled
but
there
was
something
then
she
heard
a
chair
jar
on
the
flags
and
glanced
at
railton
who
leaned
forward
weel
he
said
canna
you
speak
is
neabody
coming
yet
lucy
threw
another
glance
up
the
dale
and
her
heart
beat
an
indistinct
row
of
small
dark
objects
moved
along
the
path
with
two
tall
figures
behind
kit
coming
down
the
beck
he
brought
the
herdwicks
she
cried
canny
lad
said
railton
and
leaning
back
limply
wiped
his
face
his
forehead
was
wet
with
sweat
for
he
was
weak
and
the
suspense
had
been
keen
the
sheep
vanished
behind
a
wall
and
lucy
began
to
put
fresh
food
on
the
table
railton
hung
a
kettle
on
a
hook
above
the
fire
and
then
turned
with
a
start
as
a
girl
came
into
the
porch
miss
osborn
she
exclaimed
grace
advanced
calmly
although
there
was
some
color
in
her
face
because
she
knew
the
others
were
surprised
that
she
had
come
is
hayes
here
she
asked
mayhappen
he
at
the
pens
lucy
replied
i
thought
i
heard
his
car
then
i
missed
him
at
the
said
grace
i
was
going
to
allerby
and
my
father
asked
me
to
give
him
a
note
when
he
stopped
at
lawson
she
hesitated
and
then
resumed
impulsively
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
come
on
but
i
wanted
to
do
so
they
knew
what
she
meant
but
nobody
answered
and
grace
sat
down
on
a
bench
by
the
table
will
you
give
the
note
to
hayes
has
kit
askew
brought
the
swinset
sheep
he
coming
now
said
lucy
picking
up
the
note
and
eyes
sparkled
i
knew
he
would
bring
them
i
told
him
he
must
lucy
went
out
and
grace
asked
railton
about
his
pains
while
they
talked
somebody
shouted
outside
and
the
old
man
getting
up
with
an
effort
hobbled
to
the
door
hoad
on
dinna
close
t
pen
a
man
called
here
kit
and
t
lot
fra
swinset
three
of
four
more
shouted
and
grace
who
had
followed
railton
thought
there
was
a
note
of
triumph
in
their
cries
then
dogs
began
to
bark
somebody
opened
a
gate
and
a
flock
of
herdwicks
leaping
out
with
wet
fleeces
shaking
and
hoofs
clicking
on
stone
ran
across
a
shallow
pool
where
the
beck
had
overflowed
a
few
minutes
afterwards
kit
came
in
he
looked
tired
his
face
was
rather
haggard
and
his
clothes
were
wet
tom
the
shepherd
followed
and
sat
down
by
the
fire
it
was
nea
an
easy
job
but
we
manished
it
he
said
swinset
sheep
is
thief
sheep
but
they
none
a
match
for
kit
oad
dog
kit
stopped
abruptly
as
he
crossed
the
floor
and
his
heart
beat
ah
he
said
miss
osborn
grace
smiled
as
she
got
up
and
gave
him
her
hand
well
done
have
you
brought
them
all
but
of
course
you
have
they
in
the
pen
kit
answered
with
some
embarrassment
then
railton
stood
up
leaning
awkwardly
on
his
stick
i
misdoubted
your
plans
and
ken
that
i
was
wrang
there
nea
ither
lad
in
aw
t
dale
could
ha
browt
herdwicks
doon
bleatarn
ghyll
last
neet
weel
t
oad
ways
for
t
oad
men
but
niver
deny
again
that
the
young
and
new
are
good
he
sat
down
and
while
railton
began
to
bustle
about
the
table
grace
stole
away
she
knew
she
ought
not
to
have
come
and
had
done
so
with
a
feeling
of
rebellion
against
her
father
harshness
although
she
tried
to
persuade
herself
that
hayes
was
most
to
blame
now
she
was
glad
the
note
made
a
pretext
for
the
visit
she
had
shown
the
railtons
her
sympathy
and
had
thanked
kit
after
all
he
had
perhaps
gone
to
look
for
the
sheep
because
she
told
him
she
rather
hoped
he
had
and
rejoiced
with
the
others
at
his
success
grace
admitted
that
she
liked
kit
askew
he
was
resolute
but
modest
and
had
just
done
a
bold
deed
by
which
he
had
nothing
to
gain
praise
had
moved
her
because
she
knew
the
dalesfolk
reserve
and
that
the
farmer
would
not
without
good
grounds
have
spoken
as
he
did
moreover
she
knew
the
fells
and
it
was
something
of
an
exploit
to
bring
the
sheep
from
swinset
in
the
storm
kit
was
of
course
a
farmer
son
but
he
was
plucky
and
generous
besides
she
approved
his
steady
look
muscular
figure
and
clean
brown
skin
then
she
blushed
and
began
to
wonder
what
she
would
say
about
her
visit
to
mireside
when
she
went
home
in
the
meantime
kit
ate
his
breakfast
and
soon
afterwards
peter
askew
came
in
and
began
to
talk
to
railton
until
the
valuation
was
agreed
upon
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
do
and
it
was
some
time
before
the
men
returned
from
the
pens
they
were
plain
farmers
with
rather
hard
brown
faces
and
stood
about
the
fire
in
silence
while
hayes
sat
down
at
the
table
and
opened
his
we
have
made
up
the
tally
he
began
and
railton
interrupted
counting
in
the
lambs
and
ewes
fra
swinset
they
are
counted
hayes
replied
i
give
you
particulars
of
the
different
lots
he
read
out
some
figures
and
then
turned
to
the
group
by
the
fire
i
think
we
are
all
agreed
aw
yis
said
one
it
as
near
as
yan
can
mak
it
withoot
sending
flock
to
auction
hayes
turned
to
railton
are
you
satisfied
we
willunt
fratch
mayhappen
two
or
three
lots
would
fetch
anither
pound
or
two
but
we
ca
it
fair
then
we
must
thank
these
gentlemen
said
hayes
who
shut
his
and
took
out
a
document
as
there
is
some
other
business
and
they
have
given
us
some
time
we
need
not
keep
them
the
men
looked
at
one
another
and
peter
askew
said
if
railton
mind
we
sooner
stop
stop
if
you
like
railton
agreed
you
got
me
a
just
reckoning
and
you
neebors
aw
it
not
necessary
hayes
objected
the
business
we
have
to
transact
is
private
they
ken
it
railton
replied
in
a
stubborn
voice
i
bid
them
stop
and
the
hoose
is
mine
until
osborn
turns
me
oot
very
well
you
know
the
sum
due
to
the
landlord
are
you
ready
to
pay
i
canna
pay
it
weel
you
ken
then
can
you
give
security
for
the
debt
i
canna
and
wad
give
it
if
i
could
there
ways
a
cliver
agent
can
run
up
a
reckoning
and
when
you
want
mireside
i
have
to
gan
then
i
afraid
we
shall
be
forced
to
break
the
lease
and
take
measures
to
recover
the
sum
due
hoad
on
a
minute
said
one
of
the
group
who
turned
to
railton
would
you
like
to
stop
i
would
like
i
lived
at
mireside
sin
i
was
born
there
another
thing
it
none
too
good
a
time
for
a
sale
o
farming
stock
and
when
i
paid
osborn
i
need
some
money
to
mak
anither
start
then
a
dry
spring
wold
put
me
straight
it
ought
to
you
not
much
behind
peter
agreed
weel
you
ken
generally
willing
to
back
my
judgment
and
noo
it
seems
there
others
think
like
me
in
a
sense
the
lease
does
not
run
out
yet
kit
interposed
it
has
rather
reached
the
because
by
our
custom
railton
is
entitled
to
take
it
up
again
for
an
equal
period
if
he
and
the
landlord
agree
about
the
necessary
adjustment
our
leases
really
cover
a
double
term
hayes
turned
to
him
with
an
ironical
smile
do
you
know
much
about
tenant
law
he
asked
no
said
kit
rather
dryly
i
made
some
studies
when
i
could
get
the
books
but
they
did
take
me
far
in
fact
i
imagine
that
in
this
neighborhood
there
very
little
law
and
much
precedent
which
has
generally
been
interpreted
for
the
landlord
advantage
there
are
old
barony
laws
and
manor
rights
and
my
notion
is
that
nobody
knows
exactly
how
he
stands
but
we
let
this
go
if
railton
pays
his
fine
you
will
have
some
trouble
to
get
rid
of
him
hayes
agreed
and
railton
looked
up
with
a
puzzled
air
but
i
canna
pay
he
said
dully
the
farmer
who
had
interrupted
hayes
took
out
a
bulky
envelope
and
crossed
the
floor
well
he
said
i
think
you
wrang
your
friends
have
been
talking
aboot
the
thing
and
wad
like
t
see
you
gan
he
gave
railton
the
envelope
adding
it
a
loan
railton
hand
shook
as
he
took
out
a
bundle
of
you
good
neebors
he
said
in
a
strained
voice
but
i
dinna
think
i
ought
to
your
money
there
a
risk
not
much
risk
in
backing
an
honest
man
the
other
rejoined
and
taking
the
notes
from
railton
gave
them
to
hayes
noo
if
you
count
these
hayes
face
was
inscrutable
as
he
flicked
over
the
notes
the
correct
it
an
awkward
bundle
a
check
would
have
been
simpler
a
check
has
the
drawback
that
it
must
be
signed
kit
remarked
with
a
meaning
smile
we
modest
folk
and
nobody
was
anxious
to
write
himself
down
the
leader
i
see
said
hayes
i
do
know
if
you
modest
but
you
certainly
cautious
anyhow
we
aw
in
this
said
one
of
the
others
so
it
seems
i
hope
you
wo
lose
your
money
hayes
rejoined
dryly
and
took
out
a
fountain
pen
well
here
your
receipt
railton
i
think
there
is
anything
more
to
be
said
he
put
the
receipt
on
the
table
and
when
he
went
away
a
farmer
laughed
hayes
is
quiet
and
cunning
as
a
hill
fox
but
my
lease
has
some
time
to
go
and
he
canna
put
us
aw
oot
railton
tried
to
thank
them
while
railton
smiled
with
tears
in
her
eyes
but
the
dales
folk
dislike
emotion
and
as
soon
as
it
was
possible
the
visitors
went
away
an
hour
or
two
afterwards
grace
heard
about
the
matter
from
the
sick
wife
of
a
farmer
whom
she
had
gone
to
see
and
when
she
went
home
thought
she
had
better
not
confess
that
she
had
taken
hayes
note
to
mireside
when
osborn
joined
his
wife
and
daughter
at
the
in
the
hall
after
some
disappointing
shooting
his
remarks
about
his
tenants
were
rancorous
grace
thought
it
prudent
not
to
talk
and
left
the
table
as
soon
as
she
could
when
she
had
gone
osborn
frowned
and
getting
up
savagely
kicked
a
log
in
the
grate
i
got
a
nasty
knock
this
morning
he
said
it
not
so
much
that
i
mind
letting
railton
stop
i
hate
to
feel
i
been
baffled
and
made
the
victim
of
a
plot
after
all
was
it
rather
hayes
idea
than
yours
that
railton
ought
to
go
osborn
ventured
it
was
there
some
comfort
in
that
you
do
like
hayes
much
i
do
know
that
i
dislike
him
i
not
sure
i
trust
him
well
said
osborn
thoughtfully
i
sometimes
feel
he
keenest
about
my
interests
when
they
do
clash
with
his
and
this
last
affair
was
a
pretty
good
example
of
nepotism
for
all
that
his
nephew
would
have
been
a
better
tenant
and
have
paid
a
higher
rent
he
paused
and
knitted
his
brows
angrily
as
he
resumed
however
it
done
with
and
one
blame
railton
for
holding
on
to
his
lease
what
i
hate
to
feel
is
the
others
plotted
to
baffle
me
the
land
is
mine
but
i
sooner
get
on
well
with
my
tenants
one
can
not
so
to
speak
have
it
both
ways
osborn
remarked
timidly
oh
i
know
what
you
mean
but
i
do
think
i
a
harsh
landlord
if
money
was
not
quite
so
scarce
i
might
be
generous
in
fact
i
know
that
i
have
agreed
to
turning
railton
out
if
it
had
been
for
gerald
confounded
debts
and
his
allowance
at
woolwich
that
a
fresh
expense
osborn
thought
the
expense
did
not
count
for
much
by
comparison
with
her
husband
extravagance
but
he
had
been
rather
patient
and
she
must
not
go
too
far
well
she
said
you
have
got
railton
fine
it
is
not
a
large
sum
osborn
answered
with
a
frown
i
need
the
money
but
in
a
sense
i
sooner
it
had
not
been
paid
anyhow
i
sooner
it
had
not
been
paid
like
that
the
others
confounded
organized
opposition
annoys
me
they
were
forced
to
subscribe
to
a
fund
if
they
wanted
to
help
just
so
but
they
probably
would
have
thought
about
subscribing
if
askew
had
suggested
it
they
an
independent
lot
and
believe
in
standing
on
their
own
feet
for
a
time
after
i
got
tarnside
they
used
a
sensible
attitude
it
only
recently
they
met
with
stupid
sullen
suspicion
perhaps
it
was
rather
a
mistake
to
give
bell
the
coal
yards
lease
the
coal
yards
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
osborn
declared
the
trouble
began
earlier
and
i
grounds
for
believing
it
began
at
ashness
if
i
was
rich
enough
i
buy
the
askews
out
they
know
i
no
power
over
them
and
take
advantage
of
the
situation
the
old
man
was
a
bad
example
for
the
others
but
his
son
with
his
raw
communistic
notions
is
dangerous
if
i
could
get
rid
of
the
meddling
fool
somehow
it
would
be
a
keen
relief
he
came
back
to
the
table
and
picked
up
a
cup
of
tea
then
grumbling
that
it
had
gone
cold
he
put
it
down
noisily
and
went
out
chapter
viii
grace
finds
a
way
soon
after
the
reckoning
at
mireside
the
snow
melted
off
the
fells
and
for
a
month
dark
rain
clouds
from
the
sea
rolled
up
the
dale
they
broke
upon
the
hill
tops
in
heavy
showers
gray
mist
drifted
about
the
wet
slopes
the
becks
roared
in
the
ghylls
and
threads
of
foam
that
wavered
in
the
wind
streaked
the
crags
in
the
bottom
of
the
valley
it
was
never
really
light
water
flowed
across
the
roads
and
the
farmsteads
reeked
with
damp
all
this
was
not
unusual
and
the
dalesfolk
would
have
borne
it
patiently
had
fuel
not
been
short
large
fires
were
needed
to
dry
the
moisture
that
condensed
in
the
flagged
kitchens
and
soaked
the
thick
walls
but
coal
could
not
be
got
at
a
price
the
were
willing
to
pay
some
would
have
had
to
stint
their
families
in
food
had
they
bought
on
terms
and
the
rest
struggled
for
the
common
cause
against
the
mould
that
gathered
on
clothing
and
spoiled
the
meal
they
grumbled
but
their
resolution
hardened
as
the
strain
got
worse
while
bell
waited
rather
anxiously
for
them
to
give
way
his
yards
were
full
and
more
coal
was
coming
in
but
he
saw
that
if
he
let
the
farmers
beat
him
his
power
to
overcharge
them
another
time
would
be
gone
the
new
combine
was
dangerous
since
the
cooperative
plan
might
be
extended
to
the
purchase
of
chemical
manures
seed
and
lime
in
the
meantime
there
was
plenty
of
peat
stacked
so
that
it
would
escape
much
damage
on
malton
head
but
askew
and
his
friends
could
not
get
it
down
carts
could
not
be
used
on
the
fells
and
the
clumsy
wooden
sledges
the
farmers
called
would
not
run
across
the
boggy
moor
the
few
loads
kit
brought
down
at
the
cost
of
heavy
labor
were
carried
off
by
anxious
as
soon
as
they
arrived
the
weather
was
helping
the
monopolist
but
he
could
not
tell
if
a
change
to
frost
would
be
an
advantage
or
not
although
it
would
make
the
need
for
coal
felt
keenly
it
might
simplify
the
transport
of
peat
when
bell
thought
about
it
and
the
colliery
company
bills
came
in
he
felt
disturbed
but
he
was
stubborn
and
would
not
lower
his
price
yet
at
length
the
rain
stopped
and
after
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
keen
frost
began
the
white
fells
glittered
in
cold
sunshine
that
only
touched
the
bottom
of
the
dale
for
an
hour
or
two
the
ice
on
the
tarn
was
covered
so
that
skating
was
impossible
and
thorn
feeling
the
need
for
amusement
had
a
few
sledges
made
he
had
learned
something
about
winter
sports
in
switzerland
and
one
afternoon
stood
with
a
party
of
young
men
and
women
at
the
top
of
malton
head
they
had
practised
with
a
pair
of
skis
farther
down
the
hill
where
one
or
two
were
sliding
on
a
small
swiss
luge
but
thorn
wanted
to
find
a
long
run
for
his
toboggan
grace
stood
near
him
her
face
touched
with
warm
color
and
her
eyes
sparkling
as
she
looked
about
she
did
not
altogether
approve
of
alan
thorn
but
she
was
young
and
vigorous
and
enjoyed
the
sport
besides
she
loved
the
high
fells
and
now
they
looked
majestic
in
the
pale
sunshine
they
were
not
all
white
dark
rocks
with
glittering
veins
edged
the
snowfield
and
the
scarred
face
of
force
crag
ran
down
where
the
shoulder
of
the
moor
broke
off
four
hundred
feet
below
where
the
sun
did
not
strike
the
snow
was
a
curious
delicate
gray
and
the
bottom
of
the
dale
was
colored
an
ethereal
blue
the
riband
winding
in
a
graceful
curve
round
the
crag
marked
the
old
green
road
that
was
sometimes
used
for
bringing
down
dry
fern
and
grace
face
got
thoughtful
as
she
noted
a
row
of
men
and
horses
some
distance
off
she
imagined
they
were
askew
and
his
helpers
in
the
meantime
thorn
studied
her
with
artistic
satisfaction
he
had
an
eye
for
female
beauty
and
the
girl
looked
very
well
in
her
rather
shabby
furs
her
pose
was
light
and
graceful
her
figure
finely
modeled
and
he
liked
the
glow
the
cold
had
brought
to
her
skin
moreover
he
liked
her
joyous
confidence
when
they
tried
the
luge
on
a
risky
slide
she
was
as
and
plucky
as
a
man
and
was
marked
by
a
fine
fastidiousness
that
did
not
characterize
other
girls
he
knew
i
think
this
is
about
the
best
spot
we
have
seen
he
said
the
drop
is
steep
but
regular
although
i
expect
we
be
breathless
when
we
get
to
the
bottom
would
you
like
to
try
if
not
perhaps
somebody
else
will
come
he
looked
at
the
others
and
they
looked
at
the
white
declivity
it
was
much
longer
than
any
they
had
gone
down
and
a
girl
laughed
to
begin
with
we
watch
you
i
was
upset
on
the
last
slide
and
rather
a
long
way
to
roll
down
to
the
dale
grace
lay
down
on
a
cushion
with
her
head
just
behind
the
curved
front
thorn
found
room
farther
back
with
his
legs
in
the
snow
and
amidst
some
laughter
and
joking
the
others
pushed
them
off
the
surface
was
hard
and
for
a
time
the
toboggan
ran
smoothly
and
steadily
then
the
pace
got
faster
and
showers
of
snow
flew
up
like
spray
it
beat
into
grace
eyes
and
whipped
her
face
until
she
bent
her
head
in
the
shelter
of
the
curled
front
the
sharp
hiss
the
steel
runners
made
was
louder
the
wind
began
to
scream
and
she
got
something
of
a
shock
when
she
cautiously
looked
up
it
was
hard
to
see
through
the
snowy
spray
but
the
top
of
the
crag
looked
ominously
near
glancing
down
hill
with
smarting
eyes
she
thought
the
slope
which
from
the
top
had
seemed
to
fall
evenly
to
the
dale
was
also
inclined
towards
the
crag
she
could
not
see
much
of
the
latter
but
there
was
a
fringe
of
dark
rock
where
the
white
declivity
broke
off
are
we
getting
too
near
she
shouted
nearer
than
i
thought
thorn
gasped
not
sure
i
can
swing
the
sledge
can
you
get
back
and
help
grace
braced
herself
alan
nerve
was
good
but
there
was
a
disturbed
note
in
his
voice
besides
he
would
not
have
asked
her
help
unless
it
was
needed
wriggling
back
cautiously
she
got
level
with
thorn
although
there
was
not
much
room
for
them
side
by
side
her
feet
and
the
seam
of
her
short
dress
brushed
in
the
snow
and
tore
up
the
surface
she
felt
the
looser
stuff
beneath
foam
about
her
gaiters
but
this
was
an
advantage
the
drag
would
help
to
stop
the
sledge
and
if
she
could
put
an
extra
pressure
on
one
side
to
some
extent
direct
it
still
they
were
going
very
fast
and
at
first
she
was
nearly
pulled
off
she
tightened
her
grasp
with
her
hands
until
she
felt
her
gloves
split
and
then
risked
another
glance
ahead
the
rocks
were
very
close
but
the
sledge
had
passed
the
top
and
she
could
see
a
few
yards
down
the
dark
side
as
they
followed
the
curving
edge
of
the
crag
the
sledge
was
now
running
nearly
straight
down
the
hill
but
the
curve
bent
in
towards
them
and
she
could
not
tell
if
they
would
shoot
past
the
widest
spot
or
plunge
over
perhaps
you
had
better
let
go
thorn
said
hoarsely
grace
shook
her
head
if
she
dropped
off
it
was
uncertain
whether
she
would
stop
until
she
had
rolled
some
distance
perhaps
she
might
not
stop
before
she
reached
the
edge
of
the
crag
anyhow
she
did
not
mean
to
let
go
and
tried
to
catch
the
snow
with
her
toes
in
an
effort
to
help
thorn
to
steer
the
sledge
it
swerved
a
little
but
rushed
on
again
and
she
saw
that
the
edge
of
the
rock
curved
in
yet
she
doubted
if
they
were
far
enough
off
to
get
past
the
bend
then
she
saw
that
thorn
had
slipped
farther
back
in
order
to
increase
the
drag
of
his
legs
his
face
was
dark
with
blood
and
she
heard
his
heavy
breathing
as
he
tried
to
change
their
course
she
helped
all
she
could
while
the
snow
rolled
across
her
dress
and
then
for
a
moment
lifted
her
head
powdered
snow
beat
into
her
face
and
nearly
blinded
her
but
she
thought
there
was
now
an
unbroken
slant
in
front
they
must
have
passed
the
middle
of
the
bend
although
thorn
was
between
her
and
the
side
on
which
it
lay
and
she
was
not
sure
yet
she
remembered
with
horrible
distinctness
how
she
had
once
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
crag
and
seen
a
stone
that
rolled
over
the
top
smash
upon
the
rocks
try
again
thorn
gasped
swing
her
to
the
right
grace
let
her
body
slip
back
the
thrust
and
drag
were
telling
for
the
sledge
had
swerved
and
then
there
came
a
few
seconds
of
keen
suspense
after
this
she
heard
thorn
draw
a
labored
breath
and
felt
his
hand
on
her
waist
we
past
hitch
yourself
up
before
you
pulled
off
he
said
with
some
trouble
grace
got
back
to
her
place
and
lay
still
while
her
heart
thumped
painfully
and
something
rang
in
her
ears
the
reaction
had
begun
and
she
knew
she
could
not
move
if
thorn
wanted
help
again
it
looked
however
as
if
he
did
not
and
some
moments
afterwards
she
saw
that
the
way
was
clear
ahead
she
wondered
whether
they
would
stop
before
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
dale
and
how
far
it
was
the
round
sheepfold
in
the
first
field
looked
no
larger
than
a
finger
ring
she
was
getting
numb
and
the
rush
of
bitter
air
took
away
her
breath
hold
tight
thorn
shouted
presently
and
she
noted
that
the
hillside
broke
off
not
far
in
front
since
there
were
no
crags
near
the
spot
it
was
obvious
that
they
had
come
to
an
extra
steep
pitch
the
brow
of
which
prevented
her
from
seeing
the
bottom
next
moment
the
sledge
seemed
to
leave
the
ground
and
leap
forward
grace
thought
that
for
some
yards
they
traveled
through
the
air
and
then
the
hiss
of
the
runners
that
had
suddenly
stopped
became
a
scream
the
speed
was
bewildering
and
a
haze
of
fine
snow
streamed
past
by
and
by
however
this
began
to
thin
the
speed
slackened
and
thorn
gave
a
warning
shout
she
felt
him
try
to
turn
the
sledge
but
they
were
going
too
fast
the
light
frame
canted
and
turned
over
and
they
rolled
off
into
the
snow
when
grace
got
up
and
shook
herself
fifty
yards
lower
down
she
saw
thorn
standing
by
the
righted
sledge
he
came
to
meet
her
as
she
toiled
back
and
his
eyes
sparkled
by
george
he
said
you
are
fine
you
a
thorough
sport
grace
colored
the
compliment
was
obviously
frank
and
not
premeditated
perhaps
she
deserved
it
but
she
did
not
want
thorn
to
praise
her
his
manners
were
good
but
somehow
he
often
jarred
he
had
not
within
her
memory
said
anything
that
could
justly
offend
her
and
although
he
was
a
neighbor
and
there
were
no
secrets
in
the
dale
she
had
not
known
him
do
a
shabby
thing
yet
on
the
whole
he
rather
repelled
than
attracted
her
she
studied
him
as
he
came
down
the
hill
he
was
a
big
handsome
man
and
it
was
of
course
ridiculous
to
dislike
him
because
he
was
older
than
she
and
was
getting
fat
he
was
an
amusing
talker
and
a
good
sportsman
but
now
and
then
one
got
a
hint
of
hardness
and
cunning
somehow
so
to
speak
he
did
not
ring
true
i
held
on
because
i
thought
i
might
fall
over
the
crag
if
i
let
go
she
said
with
a
laugh
then
as
i
did
hold
on
it
was
merely
prudent
to
try
to
steer
the
sledge
oh
yes
thorn
agreed
but
the
important
thing
is
you
saw
this
and
did
lose
your
nerve
anyhow
if
you
had
lost
it
i
could
have
blamed
you
i
blame
myself
for
my
confounded
thoughtlessness
that
let
you
run
the
risk
in
fact
i
dreadfully
sorry
and
do
mind
owning
that
i
got
a
fright
grace
noted
that
he
was
rather
shaken
and
felt
vaguely
disturbed
she
had
seen
him
following
the
foxhounds
among
the
crags
for
they
hunt
on
foot
in
the
rugged
dales
and
knew
his
steadiness
and
pluck
he
had
not
been
afraid
for
himself
and
she
did
not
want
him
to
be
afraid
for
her
after
all
she
said
the
hill
seemed
to
run
down
evenly
when
we
stood
at
the
top
if
the
little
slant
towards
the
crag
deceived
you
it
deceived
me
i
know
more
about
tobogganing
and
ought
to
have
been
deceived
it
hurts
to
feel
i
did
take
proper
care
of
you
it
really
does
matter
grace
replied
with
a
smile
and
thorn
gave
her
a
steady
look
oh
but
it
does
matter
you
ought
to
see
that
i
do
see
it
grace
insisted
quietly
although
her
heart
beat
you
were
not
accountable
and
we
got
down
quite
safe
let
talk
about
something
else
thorn
eyes
rested
on
her
for
another
moment
and
then
he
made
a
sign
of
acquiescence
and
they
went
back
up
the
hill
at
the
top
he
marked
a
new
line
for
the
next
day
sport
and
then
as
the
sun
was
getting
low
the
party
started
home
by
the
old
road
near
the
bottom
they
overtook
the
askews
and
one
or
two
others
walking
at
their
horses
heads
as
they
cautiously
descended
a
steep
pitch
grace
noted
that
although
they
were
not
bringing
much
peat
there
was
a
risk
of
the
sledges
running
down
upon
the
teams
you
have
not
got
on
very
fast
she
said
to
peter
if
we
no
verra
careful
we
gan
faster
than
we
like
i
suppose
that
why
you
only
taking
half
a
load
just
that
peter
agreed
it
wad
suit
for
load
to
run
ower
the
team
better
safe
than
sorry
though
it
a
terrible
loss
o
time
then
why
do
you
look
for
an
easier
way
down
there
only
the
oad
green
road
fellside
ower
steep
for
horses
well
if
i
can
think
of
a
better
way
i
tell
you
grace
replied
smiling
and
hurried
on
after
the
others
they
left
her
at
the
tarnside
gate
and
she
stopped
abruptly
as
she
went
up
the
drive
it
had
obviously
taken
askew
a
long
time
to
bring
down
half
a
load
because
of
the
risk
to
his
horses
but
she
had
found
a
better
plan
it
was
not
needful
to
use
horses
after
they
had
pulled
the
sledges
up
the
latter
could
be
heavily
loaded
and
left
to
run
down
alone
she
must
tell
kit
askew
when
she
saw
him
next
but
she
did
not
reflect
that
it
was
curious
she
meant
to
tell
kit
and
not
peter
chapter
ix
the
plan
works
although
the
air
was
bracingly
keen
the
afternoon
was
calm
and
the
scattered
clouds
scarcely
moved
across
the
sky
the
snow
in
the
valley
shone
a
delicate
gray
and
soft
lights
and
shadows
rested
on
the
hills
a
peak
that
rose
above
the
edge
of
the
lofty
moor
gleamed
against
a
background
of
deep
blue
grace
noted
the
tranquil
beauty
of
the
landscape
but
hesitated
now
and
then
as
she
climbed
the
steep
road
out
of
the
dale
she
had
come
to
meet
kit
askew
and
now
she
reviewed
her
reasons
for
doing
so
they
did
not
look
very
sound
in
fact
if
kit
approved
the
plan
she
meant
to
suggest
she
would
perhaps
be
meddling
unjustifiably
with
her
father
business
after
all
however
it
was
really
not
his
business
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
to
help
hayes
and
the
latter
accomplice
bell
without
quite
understanding
what
this
implied
her
plan
would
prevent
his
doing
an
injustice
he
did
not
really
mean
to
do
she
suspected
that
there
was
a
touch
of
sophistry
about
her
arguments
but
would
not
own
that
she
had
come
because
she
wanted
to
meet
kit
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
meet
him
yet
when
she
stopped
at
a
gate
and
heard
the
tramp
of
horses
feet
behind
her
color
came
and
went
for
all
that
she
looked
very
calm
when
kit
pulled
up
his
team
and
went
forward
to
open
the
gate
he
made
an
abrupt
movement
as
he
recognized
her
but
his
eyes
shone
with
satisfaction
i
suppose
you
are
going
for
some
peat
she
said
kit
said
he
was
and
added
that
peter
and
two
or
three
neighbors
were
loading
the
on
the
moor
then
i
wonder
whether
you
could
let
me
have
a
small
quantity
when
you
come
down
you
can
have
a
load
if
you
want
grace
laughed
two
or
three
basketsful
would
be
enough
and
i
do
want
them
for
myself
i
went
to
see
waite
and
found
her
old
father
crippled
by
rheumatism
the
kitchen
was
cold
and
damp
but
she
had
a
very
little
fire
she
said
her
coal
was
nearly
gone
and
she
had
got
no
peat
thank
you
for
telling
me
i
did
know
said
kit
i
take
her
a
sack
as
i
go
down
the
dale
he
paused
and
hesitated
with
his
hand
on
the
open
gate
but
it
rather
cold
am
i
keeping
you
grace
noted
with
some
satisfaction
that
he
did
not
seem
to
think
it
remarkable
she
had
met
him
at
the
lonely
spot
oh
no
she
said
i
am
going
up
the
hill
i
like
the
view
from
the
crag
and
sometimes
go
to
watch
the
sunset
when
it
shines
over
the
shoulder
of
the
pike
it
throws
wonderful
lights
on
the
snow
kit
agreed
and
after
he
started
his
horses
they
went
on
together
by
and
by
grace
resumed
when
i
met
you
yesterday
your
father
said
the
sledges
often
ran
down
too
fast
and
you
could
not
put
up
a
proper
load
that
is
a
drawback
you
see
there
plenty
peat
cut
the
trouble
is
to
bring
it
down
after
the
heavy
rain
we
could
drag
the
across
the
boggy
moor
and
although
the
snow
has
made
this
easy
it
has
helped
much
otherwise
if
we
put
up
a
big
load
there
some
danger
of
the
sledges
overtaking
and
knocking
down
the
horses
where
the
track
is
steep
and
you
ca
see
a
way
of
getting
over
the
difficulty
kit
said
he
could
not
and
grace
eyes
twinkled
then
i
can
i
show
you
a
way
if
you
not
too
proud
to
take
advice
from
a
girl
certainly
not
kit
said
smiling
i
do
know
why
you
think
i
proud
then
perhaps
you
obstinate
some
of
the
dalesfolk
are
we
slow
we
like
to
try
things
properly
and
then
perhaps
we
stick
to
them
longer
than
is
needful
if
we
find
them
good
but
caution
prudent
you
very
cautious
now
grace
rejoined
you
do
seem
curious
about
my
plan
are
you
afraid
it
is
practical
no
said
kit
rather
earnestly
since
it
yours
it
no
doubt
good
then
he
pulled
himself
up
and
added
with
a
twinkle
but
i
have
heard
it
yet
well
while
your
difficulty
is
that
the
peat
comes
down
too
fast
i
think
it
does
not
go
fast
enough
you
are
afraid
about
your
horses
but
you
need
use
them
the
would
run
down
alone
do
you
understand
now
kit
started
i
expect
you
have
found
the
way
miss
osborn
and
we
owe
you
some
thanks
in
fact
you
cleverer
than
the
lot
the
admission
does
seem
to
hurt
you
grace
rejoined
but
i
imagine
to
feel
you
had
to
make
it
was
something
of
a
shock
no
said
kit
with
a
laugh
she
liked
we
often
dull
and
our
womenfolk
have
helped
us
much
but
somehow
i
did
not
expect
he
stopped
and
grace
gave
him
a
level
glance
you
mean
you
did
not
expect
help
from
me
well
he
said
i
suppose
i
did
mean
something
like
that
then
i
glad
you
owned
it
because
it
allows
me
to
clear
the
ground
i
do
want
poor
people
to
be
cold
in
winter
in
order
that
bell
may
get
rich
neither
does
my
father
want
it
you
must
believe
this
he
know
all
that
goes
on
hayes
hides
things
from
him
there
is
no
reason
i
should
help
you
to
spoil
plot
kit
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
the
girl
had
pluck
and
he
liked
her
frankness
she
was
trying
to
persuade
herself
osborn
was
not
unjust
and
although
he
imagined
she
found
it
hard
he
did
not
mean
to
make
it
harder
one
must
respect
her
staunchness
bell
is
our
real
antagonist
and
he
an
awkward
man
to
beat
he
said
however
the
hint
you
have
given
us
ought
to
be
useful
i
look
for
a
way
down
when
we
get
to
the
top
grace
warned
him
about
the
inclination
of
the
hillside
to
the
rocks
and
stopped
at
the
bottom
of
the
crag
i
think
i
go
across
the
hill
and
watch
the
first
sledge
come
down
if
you
not
too
long
she
said
and
paused
for
a
moment
perhaps
you
need
tell
the
others
it
was
my
plan
kit
said
he
would
not
do
so
and
was
strangely
satisfied
as
he
went
on
with
his
horses
he
understood
her
hesitation
it
was
delightful
to
feel
that
she
had
given
him
her
confidence
and
they
shared
a
secret
at
the
top
he
found
the
others
had
loaded
the
sledges
and
were
ready
to
start
since
the
dales
folk
are
conservative
he
had
expected
some
opposition
to
his
plan
but
they
listened
attentively
and
an
old
man
supported
him
i
mind
hearing
my
father
say
that
yan
hard
winter
after
a
wet
back
end
o
year
they
let
peat
run
doon
t
fell
what
has
been
done
yance
can
be
done
again
kit
said
nothing
for
the
other
by
using
a
favorite
motto
had
banished
his
companions
dislike
of
novelties
it
was
deeun
no
so
long
sin
another
remarked
in
my
time
they
browt
slate
doon
on
t
across
the
scree
pushed
them
off
at
top
and
let
them
go
there
was
some
further
talk
and
when
they
resolved
to
make
the
experiment
kit
went
down
the
hill
he
said
he
wanted
to
see
how
the
first
sledge
crossed
an
awkward
pitch
but
it
counted
for
much
that
he
saw
a
small
figure
below
grace
looked
satisfied
with
his
excuse
for
joining
her
and
they
waited
for
a
time
while
the
men
above
moved
the
first
load
to
the
edge
the
sunshine
had
gone
and
it
was
getting
cold
the
shadows
in
the
dale
had
faded
from
blue
to
dusky
gray
and
the
frost
was
keen
all
was
very
quiet
but
now
and
then
distant
voices
and
the
musical
rattle
of
chains
came
down
through
the
nipping
air
it
will
be
dark
before
they
ready
if
they
not
quick
said
kit
and
grace
looked
up
the
hill
i
think
they
starting
the
sledge
if
there
had
been
nobody
about
i
would
have
liked
to
come
down
with
the
peat
you
ca
imagine
how
exciting
it
is
they
watched
the
sledge
slip
over
the
brow
of
the
descent
it
got
larger
as
it
came
down
but
it
did
not
run
as
fast
as
the
toboggan
one
could
see
it
rock
and
swerve
shaking
off
loose
peats
where
the
ground
was
broken
and
grace
glanced
at
the
steep
pitch
kit
had
come
to
watch
it
will
go
down
there
with
a
splendid
rush
but
i
do
think
it
will
upset
she
said
my
plan
is
going
to
work
the
sledge
got
nearer
they
saw
the
snow
fly
up
about
its
front
and
heard
the
scream
the
runners
made
there
was
something
fascinating
about
its
smooth
but
fast
descent
and
as
it
approached
the
top
of
the
dip
they
moved
back
rather
unwillingly
to
let
it
pass
when
it
was
nearly
level
with
them
it
slowed
on
the
changing
incline
and
grace
noted
that
there
was
a
narrow
space
between
the
back
of
the
frame
and
the
peat
she
gave
kit
a
quick
look
as
she
said
if
one
wanted
i
think
one
could
jump
on
let
try
said
kit
impulsively
and
they
ran
forward
he
reached
the
sledge
first
and
throwing
himself
down
held
out
his
hand
to
grace
who
fell
upon
the
runner
log
kit
pulled
her
up
and
although
the
light
was
going
saw
her
face
glow
after
the
effort
she
had
made
her
eyes
sparkled
with
excitement
but
kit
felt
half
embarrassed
because
he
did
not
know
whether
he
had
persuaded
her
to
venture
on
an
undignified
adventure
or
she
had
persuaded
him
it
was
a
relief
to
hear
her
laugh
this
is
rather
ridiculous
and
i
do
know
if
we
can
hold
on
she
said
as
she
tried
to
grasp
the
shaking
peat
the
sledge
ran
faster
and
lurched
violently
as
it
plunged
over
the
edge
of
the
steep
drop
a
shower
of
peat
fell
on
them
the
speed
got
furious
and
they
heard
the
runners
scream
but
they
were
sheltered
from
the
rush
of
wind
and
could
not
see
ahead
after
a
few
moments
grace
looked
up
with
twinkling
eyes
you
could
drop
off
if
you
liked
are
you
sorry
you
came
no
said
kit
i
came
because
i
wanted
and
now
i
here
i
stop
i
really
think
you
mean
to
be
nice
grace
rejoined
with
amusement
and
kit
understood
she
saw
he
did
not
mean
to
admit
that
she
had
suggested
the
adventure
but
this
was
not
important
it
was
something
of
an
adventure
for
a
girl
like
miss
osborn
although
her
having
embarked
on
it
gave
him
a
delightful
feeling
of
partnership
in
a
harmless
folly
i
hope
there
nothing
in
the
way
he
said
we
going
very
fast
and
hindbeck
farm
ca
be
far
off
i
ought
to
have
looked
before
we
jumped
it
is
too
late
now
grace
answered
with
an
excited
laugh
i
imagine
you
not
as
cautious
as
you
think
but
we
wo
talk
it
hard
to
hold
on
and
i
have
much
breath
kit
moved
nearer
and
seizing
the
edge
of
the
frame
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
she
did
not
seem
to
resent
this
and
for
a
time
they
sped
down
hill
with
their
feet
plowing
through
the
snow
kit
did
not
care
how
long
the
swift
rush
lasted
but
by
and
by
he
began
to
get
anxious
the
sledge
had
gone
a
long
way
since
they
jumped
on
and
the
hillside
was
steep
to
the
bottom
where
it
met
the
hindbeck
pastures
while
he
wondered
whether
grace
would
slide
far
and
get
shaken
if
he
made
her
let
go
the
sledge
tilted
up
it
stopped
with
a
violent
shock
he
heard
stones
fall
and
was
thrown
off
amidst
a
shower
of
peat
when
he
got
up
grace
was
sitting
in
the
snow
some
distance
off
and
he
ran
towards
her
she
had
lost
her
small
fur
cap
and
her
hair
was
loose
but
to
his
relief
she
laughed
oh
she
said
it
really
was
ridiculous
but
the
plan
will
work
the
peat
will
run
down
that
is
so
kit
agreed
with
a
breathless
chuckle
i
think
it
would
have
run
into
the
hindbeck
kitchen
but
for
the
wall
then
it
was
a
wall
that
stopped
us
it
felt
like
a
rock
come
and
see
said
kit
holding
out
his
hand
to
help
her
up
i
think
she
said
i
rather
you
looked
for
my
hat
he
went
off
and
it
was
two
or
three
minutes
before
he
found
the
hat
among
the
scattered
peat
when
he
came
back
it
was
nearly
dark
but
hair
was
no
longer
untidy
and
the
snow
that
had
smeared
her
clothes
had
gone
she
walked
with
him
to
where
the
sledge
rested
on
a
pile
of
stones
and
looking
through
the
gap
they
saw
a
woman
with
a
lantern
cross
a
narrow
pasture
between
them
and
a
house
what
t
matter
the
woman
shouted
and
turned
round
janet
gan
on
and
see
what
brokken
t
wa
another
figure
came
out
of
the
gloom
and
grace
looked
at
kit
i
do
know
who
janet
is
but
i
do
know
creighton
she
talks
she
said
if
you
stop
and
explain
matters
i
go
down
the
lonning
it
was
a
glorious
adventure
she
stole
away
round
the
corner
of
the
wall
and
kit
who
understood
that
he
was
so
to
speak
to
cover
her
retreat
waited
until
the
two
women
came
up
the
one
who
carried
the
lantern
was
fat
and
homely
the
other
was
slender
and
looked
like
janet
bell
it
kit
an
stucken
in
t
wa
said
the
first
as
she
held
up
the
light
but
where
team
an
hoo
did
you
get
here
there
nea
road
this
way
kit
laughed
it
lucky
i
left
the
horses
at
the
top
this
is
a
new
plan
for
bringing
down
the
peat
and
it
certainly
works
although
next
time
we
must
try
to
stop
a
little
sooner
creighton
asked
him
some
questions
before
she
understood
what
had
happened
he
was
in
the
light
because
she
had
put
the
lantern
on
the
wall
and
although
he
could
not
see
her
companion
face
he
suspected
from
janet
quietness
that
she
was
studying
him
then
you
left
the
others
on
the
moor
the
girl
remarked
i
did
said
kit
we
sent
the
off
by
itself
and
it
was
down
when
i
jumped
on
then
none
of
the
men
came
with
you
no
said
kit
who
felt
annoyed
because
he
saw
janet
suspected
something
i
went
down
to
watch
the
sledge
and
see
if
we
had
hit
the
best
track
it
strange
said
janet
i
thought
there
was
somebody
else
when
i
first
came
out
still
of
course
it
was
nearly
dark
kit
was
puzzled
because
he
could
not
tell
how
much
janet
had
really
seen
and
thought
the
situation
needed
careful
handling
if
she
knew
miss
osborn
had
been
with
him
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
make
the
thing
look
significant
by
pretending
that
she
had
not
but
it
was
possible
that
janet
did
not
know
then
grace
had
hinted
that
she
did
not
want
their
adventure
talked
about
i
do
expect
you
could
see
very
well
if
you
had
just
come
out
from
the
light
in
the
kitchen
he
replied
anyhow
none
of
the
men
came
with
me
and
i
must
go
back
and
tell
them
not
to
send
off
another
lot
we
see
about
mending
your
wall
mrs
creighton
he
went
off
to
a
gate
that
opened
into
the
lonning
this
was
the
wisest
plan
because
he
did
not
want
to
talk
to
janet
he
was
half
afraid
of
her
but
not
because
he
thought
she
sympathized
with
her
father
plots
it
was
known
that
bell
and
his
daughter
quarreled
the
girl
was
a
dangerous
coquette
and
had
tactfully
hinted
that
she
rather
approved
kit
this
had
alarmed
kit
who
knew
she
was
clever
and
resolute
when
he
reached
the
lane
he
stopped
abruptly
as
he
remembered
something
and
took
out
his
pipe
although
he
did
not
mean
to
smoke
he
must
be
cautious
since
he
was
not
sure
if
janet
had
gone
in
striking
a
match
he
held
it
between
his
hands
as
if
he
were
going
to
light
his
pipe
and
stooped
in
the
shelter
of
a
wall
the
light
shone
on
the
ground
and
he
knitted
his
brows
as
he
saw
sharp
footsteps
in
the
snow
the
farm
people
did
not
wear
boots
that
would
leave
marks
like
these
moreover
the
footsteps
would
lead
anybody
who
thought
it
worth
while
to
follow
them
to
the
spot
where
the
sledge
upset
kit
threw
down
the
match
and
frowned
as
he
went
on
again
chapter
x
janet
meddles
bright
moonlight
sparkled
on
the
snow
when
kit
left
ashness
to
post
some
letters
he
had
written
ordering
new
machines
he
was
young
but
since
he
came
home
peter
had
allowed
much
of
the
business
of
the
farm
to
fall
into
his
hands
kit
judgment
was
sound
he
had
studied
modern
methods
at
the
agricultural
college
and
was
progressive
without
being
rash
for
the
most
part
his
experiments
had
paid
and
peter
sometimes
thought
the
talents
were
wasted
in
the
quiet
dale
kit
had
ability
particularly
for
management
then
although
he
was
rather
reserved
people
trusted
him
and
often
asked
his
advice
peter
knew
kit
was
satisfied
to
stay
at
ashness
but
for
all
that
if
the
lad
felt
he
wanted
a
wider
field
for
his
energies
later
he
would
not
stand
in
his
way
the
time
might
come
when
he
must
let
him
go
for
peter
had
a
brother
who
had
got
rich
in
america
and
was
willing
to
give
his
nephew
a
start
indeed
adam
had
written
again
not
long
since
asking
if
peter
was
going
to
send
him
it
was
a
relief
when
kit
laughed
and
declared
that
he
did
not
mean
to
leave
ashness
yet
when
he
passed
allerby
mill
kit
looked
about
icicles
covered
the
idle
wheel
a
snow
cornice
hung
over
the
flagged
roof
and
water
splashed
softly
in
the
race
farther
on
the
snowy
road
was
checkered
by
the
shadows
of
hedges
and
bare
trees
low
roofs
touched
by
rose
behind
the
trunks
and
here
and
there
a
gleam
of
yellow
light
shone
out
the
road
however
was
empty
as
kit
was
relieved
to
note
he
had
once
or
twice
recently
when
he
went
to
the
post
in
the
evening
met
janet
bell
coming
from
the
little
shop
in
the
village
in
fact
the
thing
began
to
look
significant
kit
was
sorry
for
janet
because
rule
was
harsh
and
his
neighbors
extended
their
dislike
for
him
to
his
family
all
the
same
kit
did
not
trust
the
girl
and
would
sooner
she
left
him
alone
he
might
be
taking
too
much
for
granted
but
romantic
pity
was
a
treacherous
guide
janet
was
pretty
and
clever
and
he
was
human
he
had
thought
about
changing
the
time
he
went
to
the
post
but
felt
it
would
be
cowardly
besides
he
was
occupied
all
day
and
letters
could
not
be
written
until
the
outside
work
was
done
while
a
postman
called
at
allerby
early
in
the
morning
there
was
however
nobody
about
and
for
a
minute
or
two
kit
went
on
at
a
quick
pace
he
passed
bell
house
and
then
hesitated
with
a
frown
as
a
figure
he
thought
he
knew
came
round
a
bend
in
front
close
by
the
tall
hedgerow
was
broken
by
a
stile
from
which
a
path
led
across
a
field
and
joined
the
road
farther
on
he
was
in
the
moonlight
and
if
he
vanished
the
thing
would
look
too
marked
moreover
there
would
be
something
ridiculous
about
his
running
away
kit
went
forward
wondering
whether
janet
had
noted
his
hesitation
and
she
stopped
him
near
a
big
the
shadow
of
the
branches
made
a
black
open
pattern
on
the
snow
and
a
belt
of
gloom
lay
behind
the
wide
trunk
kit
would
sooner
janet
had
stopped
in
the
moonlight
since
the
villagers
often
went
to
the
shop
and
post
in
the
evening
and
his
standing
in
the
shadow
gave
a
hint
of
secrecy
to
the
accidental
meeting
he
thought
it
strange
that
janet
did
not
see
this
you
were
walking
fast
she
said
i
believe
you
have
gone
by
if
i
had
spoken
the
frost
is
sharp
enough
to
make
one
move
briskly
and
i
something
to
do
when
i
get
back
busy
lad
said
janet
in
a
mocking
voice
you
always
in
a
hurry
kit
i
suppose
peter
works
you
hard
he
says
i
work
him
harder
than
he
likes
kit
replied
smiling
perhaps
the
truth
is
he
lets
me
have
my
way
you
lucky
janet
remarked
with
a
sigh
it
nice
to
be
able
to
do
what
you
like
there
only
one
way
at
the
mill
house
and
that
father
but
i
suppose
you
agree
with
him
that
ideas
do
count
i
daresay
their
ideas
are
as
sound
as
ours
but
i
do
know
much
about
it
we
have
no
women
except
old
bella
and
the
dairymaid
at
ashness
and
you
never
miss
them
in
that
big
lonely
house
kit
mused
for
a
moment
sometimes
particularly
on
summer
evenings
when
they
did
not
light
the
lamps
and
the
shadows
of
the
fells
rested
on
the
old
building
ashness
was
lonely
and
drearily
quiet
he
had
thought
now
and
then
the
difference
would
be
marked
if
a
woman
laugh
rang
through
the
dim
rooms
and
a
graceful
figure
sat
by
the
hearth
still
his
imagination
had
not
pictured
janet
there
oh
well
he
said
we
out
all
day
and
when
we
come
home
there
are
letters
to
write
and
books
to
read
letters
and
books
said
janet
kit
i
wonder
if
you
quite
alive
then
she
laughed
provocatively
anyhow
you
do
seem
to
know
when
you
given
a
chance
of
being
nice
kit
did
not
answer
and
wished
she
would
let
him
go
he
felt
awkward
and
thought
janet
knew
this
for
she
resumed
however
one
must
expect
too
much
and
you
want
to
get
back
it
a
habit
of
yours
you
were
in
a
hurry
to
get
away
the
last
time
i
saw
you
when
the
broke
creighton
wall
i
been
at
work
since
morning
in
the
snow
and
miss
osborn
was
waiting
for
you
in
the
lonning
no
said
kit
sharply
she
was
not
anyhow
she
was
with
you
before
she
stole
away
she
did
steal
away
kit
began
indignantly
but
hesitated
now
he
came
to
think
about
it
grace
had
gone
as
quietly
as
possible
you
mean
miss
osborn
does
nothing
undignified
for
all
that
she
want
creighton
to
see
her
i
do
suppose
osborn
would
be
pleased
to
know
his
daughter
and
you
went
for
moonlight
walks
on
the
fells
kit
knew
osborn
would
not
like
it
and
since
the
dales
folk
are
fond
of
gossip
saw
he
must
stop
the
story
going
round
i
had
not
gone
for
a
walk
with
miss
osborn
i
met
her
as
i
came
down
from
the
moor
she
did
know
i
was
coming
so
she
was
waiting
for
you
janet
remarked
with
a
hint
of
mockery
she
stopped
and
putting
her
hand
on
kit
arm
pushed
him
nearer
the
hedgerow
as
a
man
and
woman
came
round
a
neighboring
corner
kit
was
annoyed
but
he
waited
and
watched
the
people
as
they
passed
the
shadow
was
not
very
dark
and
he
thought
the
woman
give
him
a
curious
glance
he
knew
her
and
imagined
that
she
knew
him
when
the
people
went
through
a
gate
janet
laughed
that
was
very
unlucky
kit
old
nanny
fond
of
talking
i
afraid
your
character
is
gone
kit
frowned
he
did
not
see
much
humor
in
the
situation
although
janet
was
amused
oh
she
said
you
are
dull
i
expect
you
could
be
nice
if
you
tried
but
we
were
talking
about
miss
osborn
you
were
not
riding
on
the
when
you
met
her
i
do
suppose
you
could
have
stopped
it
no
said
kit
shortly
i
was
not
but
i
saw
you
and
somebody
else
hardly
a
minute
after
the
hit
the
wall
you
saw
i
did
said
janet
the
snow
was
sticking
to
your
clothes
as
if
you
had
fallen
and
you
looked
angry
when
creighton
put
the
lantern
on
the
wall
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
went
on
i
begin
to
see
you
did
come
down
on
the
and
miss
osborn
came
with
you
you
were
both
thrown
off
by
the
upset
at
the
wall
well
if
you
persuaded
her
to
join
you
in
an
adventure
like
that
it
looks
as
if
you
were
pretty
good
friends
kit
said
nothing
in
a
sense
miss
osborn
had
persuaded
him
and
it
was
difficult
to
explain
that
both
had
really
given
way
to
a
rash
impulse
somewhat
to
his
surprise
janet
gently
touched
his
arm
be
careful
kit
i
would
like
to
see
you
hurt
miss
osborn
friends
are
not
your
kind
of
folk
she
only
wants
to
amuse
herself
when
they
are
not
about
that
ridiculous
kit
declared
miss
osborn
is
not
amusing
herself
with
me
perhaps
you
ought
to
know
janet
rejoined
with
some
dryness
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
you
not
always
very
bright
anyhow
when
she
finds
the
game
tiresome
she
soon
get
rid
of
you
i
meet
miss
osborn
now
and
then
and
sometimes
she
stops
and
speaks
that
is
all
kit
said
sternly
i
imagine
it
enough
janet
remarked
well
i
do
want
to
see
you
made
to
look
a
fool
you
rather
a
good
sort
kit
if
you
not
very
clever
be
careful
and
remember
you
have
been
warned
she
gave
him
a
friendly
nod
and
went
off
but
after
a
few
moments
turned
and
looked
back
kit
was
walking
down
the
road
with
swift
angry
strides
janet
smiled
but
when
she
entered
the
kitchen
her
face
was
flushed
soon
after
she
sat
down
by
the
fire
bell
came
in
and
leaned
against
the
table
with
an
angry
frown
there
two
mair
trucks
o
coal
and
i
canna
find
room
for
t
stuff
he
said
yards
is
full
and
i
only
sold
three
or
four
car
loads
last
week
janet
knew
silence
was
prudent
when
her
father
was
disturbed
but
he
had
given
her
a
lead
kit
was
a
fool
and
although
she
doubted
if
he
were
as
dull
as
he
pretended
she
was
angry
with
him
anyhow
it
might
be
possible
to
stop
his
ridiculous
infatuation
for
miss
osborn
you
ca
sell
coal
when
the
askews
are
giving
peat
away
she
said
looks
like
that
bell
agreed
i
ha
broke
the
others
before
noo
if
i
had
had
peter
and
kit
against
me
hooiver
if
i
canna
sell
coal
i
canna
pay
the
rent
and
landlord
will
have
to
do
something
mayhappen
it
will
be
easier
for
him
if
he
kens
the
askews
started
the
plot
none
too
fond
of
them
he
would
like
them
any
better
if
he
knew
what
i
know
janet
remarked
with
a
malicious
smile
what
do
you
ken
about
them
bell
asked
scornfully
i
do
imagine
osborn
wants
kit
for
his
bell
started
and
then
laughed
harshly
old
wives
crack
kit
not
such
a
fool
you
know
best
said
janet
if
you
like
i
tell
you
what
i
seen
she
did
so
and
bell
mean
face
got
thoughtful
on
the
whole
janet
did
not
exaggerate
much
although
she
now
and
then
made
a
rather
unwarranted
implication
she
threw
a
fresh
light
on
matters
the
gossips
already
talked
about
among
others
were
grace
visit
to
mireside
the
morning
railton
sheep
were
counted
and
her
meeting
with
kit
before
he
went
to
look
for
the
herdwicks
when
she
stopped
bell
knitted
his
brows
if
it
was
used
right
i
might
mak
some
use
o
this
he
observed
we
see
what
osborn
says
about
coal
yards
and
the
alterations
at
mill
he
went
to
his
office
and
janet
sat
quietly
by
the
fire
her
plot
would
work
miss
osborn
should
not
have
kit
bell
made
some
calculations
his
money
was
getting
short
he
had
bills
to
pay
and
his
stock
of
coal
was
large
he
could
not
hold
it
much
longer
and
since
the
askews
were
bringing
down
large
quantities
of
peat
there
was
no
ground
for
imagining
the
dalesfolk
would
give
way
it
looked
as
if
he
must
meet
them
and
he
wrote
a
notice
that
coal
would
be
delivered
by
the
trailer
lurry
at
a
reduction
of
a
ton
when
he
had
put
this
in
an
envelope
for
the
printers
bell
knitted
his
brows
although
his
neighbors
would
sooner
burn
coal
than
peat
he
was
not
sure
the
reduction
would
stimulate
the
demand
for
the
former
and
he
must
look
for
relief
in
some
other
direction
he
paid
a
high
rent
for
the
yards
and
the
landlord
ought
to
help
osborn
would
no
doubt
be
reluctant
but
he
might
be
forced
bell
lease
of
the
mill
would
soon
run
out
nobody
else
could
pay
as
much
as
he
paid
and
he
would
demand
certain
expensive
alterations
furthermore
osborn
did
not
like
the
askews
and
bell
imagined
he
saw
how
to
strike
a
blow
at
kit
janet
had
shown
him
the
way
it
would
be
some
satisfaction
to
punish
the
meddlesome
fellow
two
days
afterwards
the
notice
was
fixed
on
the
gateposts
but
a
week
went
by
without
its
attracting
fresh
customers
then
a
bill
from
the
colliery
arrived
and
bell
put
down
his
price
another
for
a
day
or
two
no
orders
came
in
and
he
resolved
to
wait
until
the
week
was
out
and
then
if
needful
get
hayes
to
arrange
for
a
meeting
with
osborn
on
the
last
evening
of
the
week
a
number
of
the
met
in
the
kitchen
at
ashness
and
for
a
time
talked
about
the
weather
and
the
price
of
sheep
askew
let
them
talk
and
kit
was
too
preoccupied
to
give
them
a
lead
he
had
been
thoughtful
since
he
met
janet
bell
for
she
had
banished
the
he
had
unconsciously
used
and
thrown
a
new
and
disturbing
light
on
his
friendship
with
grace
ridiculous
as
it
was
in
many
ways
he
was
falling
in
love
with
grace
osborn
moreover
he
had
met
her
an
hour
since
and
she
had
talked
with
a
friendly
confidence
that
made
his
heart
beat
the
girl
liked
and
trusted
him
and
although
he
durst
not
look
for
more
this
in
itself
was
much
it
was
plain
that
he
ought
to
conquer
his
infatuation
but
he
doubted
if
he
could
listening
to
the
others
mechanically
he
was
silent
and
absorbed
until
one
asked
weel
what
to
be
done
aboot
coal
noo
are
we
gan
t
buy
i
dinna
ken
said
another
my
womenfolk
are
grumelling
an
lang
sin
we
had
good
light
bread
but
they
none
for
letting
bell
have
his
way
he
come
doon
five
shillings
and
we
peat
enough
to
fall
back
on
if
he
puts
up
price
again
somebody
else
remarked
hooiver
i
reckon
forced
to
sell
and
we
might
get
anither
off
if
we
wait
peter
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
it
a
kittle
point
t
womenfolk
have
been
patient
and
bell
canna
rob
us
much
if
we
buy
from
him
noo
aw
t
same
we
can
beat
him
doon
some
shillings
if
we
hoad
on
then
hoad
on
and
break
the
grasping
skinflint
said
one
of
the
younger
men
i
doot
if
we
can
break
him
and
wad
say
it
wise
to
try
if
come
down
anither
shilling
i
think
we
might
tak
his
coal
that
wad
be
a
just
price
and
we
ought
to
be
satisfied
let
him
smart
urged
the
other
he
robbed
us
lang
enough
well
said
peter
thoughtfully
i
dinna
ken
if
that
a
reason
for
robbing
him
and
it
sometimes
safer
no
to
push
your
enemy
over
hard
when
he
willing
to
give
in
you
must
choose
if
you
hoad
on
and
force
him
to
sell
at
a
big
loss
the
fight
can
only
end
in
yan
o
two
ways
he
mak
you
pay
top
price
for
cattle
food
lime
and
patent
manures
or
you
drive
him
oot
o
dale
you
must
reckon
if
strong
enough
we
hear
what
kit
says
one
of
the
rest
remarked
kit
mood
was
hardly
normal
he
was
not
often
rash
but
he
felt
sore
and
rebellious
and
this
had
a
stronger
influence
than
he
knew
miss
osborn
liked
him
but
her
father
rank
and
traditions
were
daunting
obstacles
kit
felt
this
was
unjust
and
raw
passions
and
prejudices
that
he
was
as
a
rule
too
sensible
to
indulge
got
the
mastery
my
father
is
right
he
said
we
have
started
a
fight
with
bell
he
a
dangerous
man
to
rouse
and
will
make
us
pay
unless
we
beat
him
besides
he
has
made
some
pay
already
old
rheumatic
men
and
young
children
starved
by
grates
when
the
snow
stopped
us
getting
the
peat
and
you
have
seen
the
profits
you
worked
hard
for
melt
before
the
price
bell
charged
for
he
been
getting
greedier
until
he
imagined
he
could
rob
us
as
he
liked
and
since
he
has
forced
us
into
the
quarrel
my
notion
is
we
ought
to
fight
it
out
peter
looked
surprised
but
did
not
speak
and
there
was
silence
for
a
few
moments
then
one
said
i
with
kit
we
hoad
on
until
bell
comes
doon
if
he
does
we
talk
aboot
it
again
after
some
argument
the
rest
agreed
and
when
they
went
away
peter
turned
to
his
son
mayhappen
you
sent
them
t
right
road
but
i
dinna
ken
i
none
fond
o
fratching
unless
i
forced
we
are
forced
kit
answered
moodily
peter
gave
him
a
keen
glance
and
then
spread
out
his
hands
it
possible
for
aw
that
it
wad
ha
done
much
harm
to
give
t
man
his
chance
o
makin
peace
kit
did
not
answer
but
went
out
and
askew
sat
by
the
fire
with
a
thoughtful
look
something
had
happened
to
the
lad
and
peter
wondered
what
it
was
he
felt
vaguely
disturbed
but
could
see
no
light
chapter
xi
osborn
pride
gets
hurt
soon
after
the
farmers
met
at
ashness
bell
feeling
sore
and
resentful
sat
one
evening
in
the
tarnside
library
osborn
after
fixing
a
time
for
his
visit
had
kept
him
waiting
twenty
minutes
and
bell
had
come
to
think
himself
a
man
of
a
little
importance
the
spacious
library
was
very
cold
and
the
end
of
a
small
log
smouldered
among
the
ashes
in
the
grate
bell
knew
he
had
been
brought
into
the
library
because
it
was
business
room
but
the
latter
might
have
ordered
the
fire
to
be
made
up
his
neglect
rankled
although
bell
had
something
else
to
think
about
he
had
lowered
his
price
for
coal
another
shilling
without
attracting
buyers
and
now
admitted
that
the
dales
folks
resistance
was
getting
dangerous
to
some
extent
the
askews
were
accountable
for
this
but
osborn
got
a
large
share
of
the
profit
bell
had
hoped
to
make
one
did
not
pay
a
high
rent
for
nothing
by
and
by
bell
looked
at
hayes
who
stood
by
the
hearth
the
next
time
i
come
to
tarnside
osborn
will
wait
for
me
he
remarked
hayes
made
a
warning
gesture
there
were
steps
in
the
passage
and
osborn
came
in
he
sat
down
at
the
end
of
the
table
and
looked
at
his
watch
i
can
give
you
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
said
perhaps
we
had
better
begin
the
big
room
was
nearly
dark
but
the
men
sat
in
the
light
a
shaded
lamp
threw
across
the
table
osborn
looked
half
bored
and
half
impatient
hayes
was
urbanely
inscrutable
while
bell
mean
face
was
marked
by
greed
bell
finds
his
stock
of
coal
accumulating
faster
than
he
likes
said
hayes
he
must
pay
on
delivery
and
since
his
customers
have
combined
against
him
feels
he
entitled
to
some
relief
i
do
see
how
that
is
my
business
osborn
rejoined
bell
might
get
over
the
difficulty
by
lowering
his
price
i
putten
it
doon
bell
broke
in
the
price
i
can
sell
at
is
fixed
by
my
rent
to
some
extent
the
argument
is
logical
said
hayes
then
am
i
to
understand
that
bell
expects
me
to
reduce
his
rent
not
to
begin
with
hayes
answered
giving
bell
a
warning
glance
he
imagines
he
might
gain
his
object
almost
as
well
if
we
stopped
askew
cutting
peat
you
can
not
stop
him
the
peat
is
his
we
might
embarrass
him
while
the
snow
lasts
it
saves
some
awkward
labor
to
cross
creighton
field
and
use
his
lonning
a
tenant
is
not
entitled
to
grant
a
allowing
a
friend
to
use
the
lane
for
a
week
or
two
can
hardly
be
called
a
well
although
askew
owns
the
moor
it
doubtful
if
he
is
entitled
to
remove
peat
for
sale
unless
by
arrangement
with
the
lord
of
the
manor
i
have
seen
sir
gordon
agent
and
he
is
not
unwilling
to
dispute
the
point
at
my
cost
said
osborn
with
a
sarcastic
smile
enforcing
the
old
manorial
rights
which
nobody
knows
much
about
would
be
an
expensive
business
and
i
have
no
money
to
risk
however
if
bell
is
willing
to
pay
the
lawyers
i
pay
nowt
but
rent
it
high
enough
bell
declared
osborn
shrugged
very
well
it
would
cost
too
much
to
try
to
frighten
askew
off
he
confoundedly
shrewd
and
obstinate
bell
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
but
his
face
got
hard
as
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
osborn
there
another
matter
t
mill
lease
will
soon
fall
in
and
i
canna
it
on
again
unless
i
get
the
repairs
and
improvements
done
hayes
has
t
list
the
agent
took
out
the
list
with
some
builders
and
estimates
and
osborn
frowned
as
he
studied
the
documents
it
was
obvious
that
bell
meant
to
use
pressure
i
do
like
to
be
threatened
he
replied
it
not
a
threat
said
bell
with
a
cunning
smile
if
i
to
lose
my
money
at
coal
yards
i
must
earn
some
at
mill
but
unless
i
get
repairs
and
new
machines
mill
willunt
pay
to
run
he
paused
and
studying
osborn
face
resumed
there
be
nea
peace
for
either
o
us
while
the
askews
gan
aboot
makin
trouble
i
suppose
that
is
so
to
some
extent
osborn
agreed
then
is
it
fair
to
leave
me
to
fratch
wi
them
after
aw
they
mair
your
enemies
than
mine
i
do
understand
you
i
have
no
coal
to
sell
bell
looked
up
with
a
sour
grin
there
worse
ways
o
hurting
a
proud
man
than
touching
his
pocket
if
you
dinna
ken
what
going
on
it
time
you
watched
young
kit
i
say
nea
mair
but
aw
t
wives
are
cracking
and
you
can
ask
hayes
he
kens
osborn
face
got
red
but
he
gave
bell
a
haughty
look
anything
that
touches
me
personally
is
my
private
concern
and
we
are
talking
about
the
lease
of
the
mill
i
can
not
make
all
the
improvements
you
ask
for
but
perhaps
something
can
be
done
when
we
have
studied
the
matter
hayes
will
let
you
know
bell
got
up
and
when
he
went
out
osborn
turned
to
hayes
what
did
the
fellow
mean
he
said
you
knew
it
dangerous
ground
and
i
frankly
wish
he
told
you
to
ask
somebody
else
however
there
is
some
gossip
go
on
said
osborn
sternly
whom
are
they
gossiping
about
miss
osborn
since
you
insist
osborn
clenched
his
fist
and
the
veins
rose
on
his
forehead
as
he
said
and
young
askew
hayes
made
a
sign
of
agreement
and
osborn
getting
up
walked
across
the
floor
he
came
back
with
a
savage
sparkle
in
his
eyes
and
stood
in
front
of
hayes
tell
me
what
you
know
with
a
pretense
of
reluctance
hayes
obeyed
he
told
osborn
about
grace
visit
to
railton
and
hinted
that
she
had
gone
to
find
out
if
kit
had
brought
the
sheep
then
he
narrated
their
meeting
in
the
dark
near
creighton
farm
and
stated
his
grounds
for
imagining
she
had
ridden
down
the
hill
on
the
first
load
of
peat
hayes
was
tactful
and
apologetic
but
he
made
it
plain
that
the
girl
was
in
kit
confidence
and
had
known
his
plans
osborn
stopped
him
with
a
savage
gesture
his
face
was
deeply
flushed
and
his
voice
was
hoarse
as
he
said
that
is
enough
the
thing
looks
impossible
i
must
try
to
find
out
what
foundation
there
is
for
the
ridiculous
tale
i
shall
be
relieved
if
you
do
find
it
is
ridiculous
said
hayes
who
went
off
soon
afterwards
for
some
minutes
osborn
leaned
against
the
mantel
with
his
hands
clenched
for
he
had
got
a
shock
he
admitted
that
the
osborns
had
some
faults
but
they
were
the
tarnside
osborns
and
had
ruled
the
dale
for
a
very
long
time
it
was
something
to
spring
from
such
a
stock
and
the
wilful
girl
had
disgraced
them
all
osborn
had
suspected
grace
of
holding
dangerous
modern
views
but
it
was
unthinkably
humiliating
that
she
had
engaged
in
a
flirtation
with
a
farmer
son
he
had
declared
the
thing
impossible
but
he
feared
it
was
true
hayes
had
been
very
clear
about
her
visit
to
railton
and
her
coming
down
malton
head
on
askew
sledge
was
ominous
she
must
have
been
strongly
attracted
by
kit
since
she
had
done
a
thing
like
that
besides
she
had
obviously
sympathized
with
and
perhaps
helped
his
plans
this
was
treachery
because
it
was
a
tradition
of
the
osborns
that
they
stood
together
by
and
by
he
heard
voices
in
the
hall
and
braced
himself
he
must
go
down
to
receive
his
guests
and
was
glad
that
they
had
come
since
he
did
not
want
to
tell
his
wife
about
the
matter
yet
in
fact
he
did
not
think
he
would
talk
to
grace
the
thing
was
humiliating
and
there
was
a
possibility
that
hayes
had
been
mistaken
osborn
resolved
to
watch
the
girl
and
then
insist
on
a
reckoning
if
she
gave
him
grounds
for
doing
so
he
went
down
and
carried
out
his
hospitable
duties
next
morning
he
arranged
for
a
day
shooting
the
snow
had
nearly
gone
and
there
were
a
few
pheasants
left
in
redmire
wood
the
party
started
early
taking
their
lunch
and
in
the
afternoon
grace
left
tarnside
and
walked
down
the
dale
she
had
no
particular
object
but
the
day
was
fine
and
she
wondered
whether
kit
had
brought
all
the
peat
from
malton
head
there
was
no
wind
and
the
frost
was
not
keen
gray
clouds
trailed
across
the
sky
that
was
touched
with
yellow
in
the
west
and
soft
elusive
lights
played
about
the
dale
patches
of
snow
on
the
fellsides
gleamed
and
faded
mossy
belts
glowed
vivid
green
red
berries
in
the
hedgerows
shone
among
withered
leaves
and
fern
and
then
the
light
passed
on
and
left
the
valley
dim
something
in
its
calm
beauty
reacted
on
the
girl
and
made
her
thoughtful
she
loved
the
dale
and
felt
that
she
might
be
happy
there
if
it
were
not
for
her
father
poverty
and
overbearing
temperament
after
all
they
were
not
really
poor
they
had
enough
to
satisfy
their
needs
their
clinging
to
traditions
caused
the
strain
one
gained
nothing
by
pretending
to
be
rich
and
important
there
was
no
logical
reason
for
trying
to
live
like
one
ancestors
and
the
effort
cost
the
osborns
much
it
meant
stern
private
economy
public
ostentation
and
many
small
deceits
grace
was
getting
tired
of
this
pretense
she
wanted
something
simpler
and
dignified
for
the
most
part
the
dalesfolk
looked
happy
and
she
had
come
to
envy
them
they
had
their
troubles
but
they
were
troubles
all
mankind
must
bear
and
they
had
joys
one
did
not
properly
value
at
tarnside
human
fellowship
and
sympathy
and
freedom
to
follow
their
bent
a
shepherd
daughter
for
example
could
marry
whom
she
liked
and
was
not
forced
to
accept
a
husband
who
had
wealth
enough
to
satisfy
her
parents
grace
blushed
as
she
thought
of
alan
thorn
and
contrasted
him
with
kit
she
did
not
want
to
marry
yet
but
perhaps
if
kit
were
not
a
working
farmer
son
she
pulled
herself
up
with
a
smile
for
it
looked
as
if
she
had
not
broken
free
from
the
family
traditions
after
all
it
did
not
matter
if
kit
were
a
farmer
son
he
was
honest
and
generous
he
had
a
figure
bright
eyes
and
a
clean
brown
skin
but
since
kit
was
not
her
lover
she
was
indulging
in
idle
sentiment
and
then
she
admitted
that
he
might
love
her
although
she
did
not
yet
love
him
indeed
if
she
must
be
honest
the
thing
was
possible
she
had
seen
his
face
brighten
and
remarked
his
satisfaction
when
they
met
then
she
stopped
abruptly
as
she
saw
him
coming
down
the
road
there
was
a
path
across
a
field
close
by
but
it
would
be
admitting
too
much
if
she
tried
to
avoid
him
and
she
went
on
kit
came
up
dressed
in
rough
working
clothes
with
muddy
leggings
and
a
hedge
stick
in
his
hand
two
dogs
ran
before
him
and
it
looked
as
if
he
had
been
driving
sheep
grace
was
very
calm
when
he
took
off
his
cap
and
he
thought
the
hint
of
stateliness
he
sometimes
noted
was
rather
marked
it
did
not
daunt
him
he
felt
it
was
proper
grace
should
look
like
that
she
noted
that
he
was
hot
and
breathless
i
saw
you
as
i
was
bringing
the
sheep
down
burton
ghyll
he
said
then
you
must
have
good
eyes
grace
remarked
it
a
long
way
and
i
do
wear
conspicuous
clothes
kit
laughed
i
have
known
you
much
farther
off
there
nobody
in
the
dale
who
walks
like
you
grace
gave
him
a
quiet
glance
that
he
met
without
embarrassment
she
saw
that
he
had
not
meant
to
offer
her
a
cheap
compliment
yet
the
compliment
was
justified
a
dancing
master
had
told
her
that
she
walked
and
carried
herself
well
but
where
are
the
sheep
she
asked
i
left
them
in
the
field
at
the
beckfoot
he
answered
with
a
touch
of
awkwardness
we
can
bring
them
down
afterwards
i
remembered
i
wanted
something
at
allerby
grace
turned
her
head
to
hide
a
smile
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
remembered
he
wanted
to
go
to
allerby
when
he
saw
her
oh
well
she
said
i
am
going
part
of
the
way
however
i
stop
you
if
you
want
to
get
back
to
the
sheep
it
is
at
all
important
kit
declared
then
he
paused
and
grace
thought
he
was
studying
his
old
and
rather
muddy
clothes
but
of
course
he
resumed
it
possible
you
sooner
go
on
alone
she
laughed
do
be
ridiculous
askew
i
think
you
know
what
i
mean
i
did
want
to
keep
you
from
your
work
he
looked
relieved
yes
although
i
not
very
clever
at
this
sort
of
thing
i
generally
do
know
what
you
mean
i
ca
tell
if
strange
or
not
it
certainly
is
not
worth
while
puzzling
about
i
expect
i
rather
obvious
for
that
matter
so
are
you
frankness
often
saves
you
some
trouble
and
i
do
know
if
it
gives
your
opponent
the
advantage
some
folks
imagine
however
it
not
our
rule
in
the
dale
to
say
all
we
feel
it
not
bell
for
example
how
is
the
coal
campaign
getting
on
well
said
kit
thoughtfully
so
far
as
that
goes
i
believe
we
have
beaten
him
there
a
new
notice
that
lowers
the
price
altogether
and
last
night
we
advised
folks
to
buy
but
i
do
know
if
the
fight
over
bell
may
find
another
way
of
putting
on
the
screw
i
hope
he
will
give
it
up
grace
replied
i
tried
to
help
because
i
felt
i
must
but
of
course
you
see
i
ca
help
again
kit
made
a
sign
of
understanding
yes
you
showed
us
how
to
bring
the
peat
down
now
i
do
know
what
to
say
it
awkward
ground
they
were
silent
for
some
time
afterwards
for
both
had
said
enough
and
knew
that
osborn
resentment
must
be
reckoned
on
it
made
them
feel
like
accomplices
and
drew
them
together
they
were
young
and
not
given
to
looking
far
ahead
but
they
saw
the
threat
that
the
friendship
both
valued
might
be
broken
off
by
and
by
three
or
four
reports
rang
through
the
calm
air
and
grace
came
near
to
stopping
but
did
not
she
had
forgotten
osborn
was
shooting
in
redmire
wood
and
she
and
kit
must
pass
its
edge
for
all
that
she
could
not
turn
back
kit
would
guess
why
she
did
so
it
would
be
an
awkward
admission
that
she
was
afraid
of
being
seen
with
him
by
osborn
or
his
friends
she
was
afraid
but
she
was
proud
and
went
on
hoping
that
kit
had
not
noted
her
hesitation
he
had
not
but
was
puzzled
by
her
resolute
and
look
the
guns
were
silent
when
they
came
to
the
wood
which
rolled
down
the
hillside
below
the
road
here
and
there
a
white
birch
trunk
and
a
yellow
patch
of
oak
leaves
shone
among
the
dark
firs
the
beech
hedge
was
covered
by
withered
brown
foliage
a
belt
of
grass
ran
between
the
wood
and
road
and
grace
took
the
little
path
along
its
edge
her
feet
made
no
noise
and
her
tweed
dress
harmonized
with
the
subdued
coloring
of
dead
leaves
and
trunks
the
light
was
not
good
and
she
thought
she
would
not
be
visible
a
short
distance
off
besides
the
sportsmen
might
be
at
the
other
side
of
the
wood
she
hoped
they
were
since
she
vaguely
perceived
that
if
osborn
saw
her
it
would
force
a
crisis
she
was
not
yet
ready
to
meet
then
her
thoughts
were
disturbed
for
somebody
in
the
wood
shouted
mark
cock
flying
low
to
right
a
gunshot
rang
out
close
by
and
a
small
brown
bird
skimming
the
top
of
the
hedge
fluttered
awkwardly
across
the
road
next
moment
dry
twigs
rustled
and
a
young
man
leaped
on
to
the
grass
with
a
smoking
gun
in
his
hand
as
he
threw
it
to
his
shoulder
kit
ran
forward
and
struck
the
barrel
there
was
a
flash
and
while
the
echoes
of
the
report
rolled
across
the
wood
a
little
puff
of
smoke
floated
about
the
men
grace
stood
still
trembling
for
she
knew
she
had
run
some
risk
of
being
shot
why
do
you
look
before
you
shoot
kit
shouted
in
a
strange
hoarse
voice
you
no
business
to
use
a
gun
on
a
public
road
it
lucky
i
was
quick
that
is
so
my
fault
gasped
the
other
who
took
off
his
cap
as
he
turned
to
grace
very
sorry
miss
osborn
did
see
you
wanted
to
get
the
woodcock
hope
you
not
startled
much
grace
forced
a
smile
she
had
physical
courage
and
was
shaken
rather
by
what
she
saw
in
kit
face
than
the
risk
she
had
run
kit
looked
strangely
white
and
strained
he
had
obviously
got
a
bad
shock
but
she
thought
he
would
not
have
looked
like
that
had
he
saved
anybody
else
from
the
other
gun
my
dress
is
hard
to
see
against
the
trees
you
really
need
be
disturbed
she
said
the
young
man
renewed
his
confused
apologies
and
when
he
pushed
through
the
hedge
and
they
went
on
again
grace
looked
at
kit
he
had
not
got
his
color
back
his
lips
were
set
and
his
gaze
was
fixed
the
shock
had
broken
his
control
and
brought
her
enlightenment
he
loved
her
but
she
needed
time
and
quietness
to
grapple
with
the
situation
her
heart
beat
and
her
nerves
tingled
she
could
not
see
the
line
she
ought
to
take
yet
he
must
be
thanked
you
were
very
quick
she
said
as
calmly
as
possible
although
she
was
conscious
of
a
curious
pride
in
him
somehow
i
knew
if
there
was
need
for
quickness
you
would
act
like
that
i
believe
i
was
stupid
enough
to
stand
still
until
you
jumped
well
of
course
you
know
i
thank
you
she
stopped
for
kit
who
turned
his
head
for
a
moment
turned
it
back
and
looked
straight
in
front
he
durst
not
trust
himself
to
speak
and
they
went
on
silently
chapter
xii
osborn
interferes
when
grace
and
kit
had
gone
a
short
distance
they
heard
voices
and
a
rattle
of
sticks
in
the
wood
but
the
noise
got
fainter
and
she
imagined
the
beaters
were
moving
the
other
way
ferrars
who
shot
at
the
woodcock
had
probably
not
had
time
to
tell
osborn
about
his
carelessness
and
it
looked
as
if
nobody
else
had
been
posted
near
the
road
this
was
something
of
a
relief
but
grace
felt
anxious
a
gate
not
far
off
led
to
a
drive
in
the
wood
and
she
thought
she
had
heard
osborn
voice
she
kept
on
the
belt
of
grass
which
got
narrower
so
that
the
path
ran
close
to
the
hedge
on
the
opposite
side
a
clump
of
threw
a
shadow
across
the
road
and
a
patch
of
sky
shone
behind
an
opening
in
the
trees
the
stiff
cut
sharply
against
the
glow
but
where
she
and
kit
were
the
light
was
dim
for
all
that
she
stopped
abruptly
when
a
man
came
out
of
the
wood
and
turned
as
if
to
look
up
the
road
it
was
osborn
and
she
thought
she
knew
for
whom
he
was
looking
grace
judgment
failed
her
she
pushed
kit
towards
the
beech
hedge
and
they
stepped
into
a
small
hollow
among
the
withered
leaves
kit
like
grace
had
not
had
time
for
thought
but
as
osborn
looking
straight
in
front
went
past
he
felt
he
had
done
wrong
for
one
thing
it
was
rather
shabby
to
hide
and
his
doing
so
reflected
on
his
companion
the
feeling
got
stronger
as
osborn
went
up
the
road
and
kit
was
sorry
he
had
given
way
to
a
cowardly
impulse
yet
since
he
had
hidden
he
must
wait
after
a
few
moments
grace
turned
her
head
and
kit
saw
her
face
was
flushed
it
was
obvious
that
she
felt
much
as
he
felt
she
had
prompted
him
to
hide
but
she
had
done
so
in
sudden
alarm
and
he
ought
to
have
kept
cool
and
thought
for
both
particularly
since
it
was
getting
plain
that
osborn
was
looking
for
them
the
latter
stopped
hesitated
and
came
back
and
grace
turned
sharply
to
kit
her
look
was
strained
but
he
got
a
hint
of
haughtiness
and
resolve
he
made
a
sign
that
he
understood
and
knew
he
had
done
well
when
he
moved
back
from
the
hedge
a
hesitation
would
have
cost
him
the
girl
respect
they
waited
in
the
road
and
kit
heart
beat
fast
but
not
with
fear
osborn
stopped
a
yard
or
two
off
and
looked
at
them
with
sternly
controlled
rage
it
obvious
that
i
passed
you
just
now
he
said
you
did
i
ought
to
have
stopped
you
kit
agreed
for
a
moment
it
did
not
strike
me
that
you
were
looking
for
miss
osborn
osborn
glanced
at
the
hollow
in
the
hedge
it
curious
you
stopped
at
a
spot
where
there
was
not
much
chance
of
your
being
seen
grace
turned
as
if
she
meant
to
speak
but
kit
resumed
after
all
i
do
know
that
you
are
entitled
to
question
what
i
do
on
a
public
road
certainly
not
said
osborn
with
forced
quietness
i
have
however
a
right
to
question
my
daughter
choice
of
her
acquaintances
and
it
looks
as
if
i
had
some
grounds
for
using
my
authority
he
paused
and
turned
to
grace
your
mother
is
waiting
for
you
you
had
better
go
home
grace
hesitated
glancing
at
kit
it
was
her
fault
that
they
had
hidden
and
she
would
have
waited
had
she
thought
he
wanted
her
kit
face
however
was
hard
and
inscrutable
and
with
something
of
an
effort
she
went
away
it
was
a
relief
to
kit
that
she
had
gone
he
had
meant
to
keep
her
out
of
the
quarrel
and
now
he
was
ready
to
talk
to
osborn
the
matter
does
end
here
the
latter
remarked
there
something
to
be
said
that
your
father
ought
to
know
i
am
going
to
ashness
and
expect
you
to
come
with
me
you
must
wait
i
have
some
sheep
at
the
beckfoot
and
it
will
take
me
half
an
hour
to
drive
them
home
kit
said
coolly
osborn
looked
at
him
with
savage
surprise
it
was
unthinkable
that
he
should
be
forced
to
wait
while
the
fellow
went
for
his
sheep
but
he
saw
that
kit
was
not
to
be
moved
and
tried
to
control
his
anger
very
well
i
will
meet
you
at
ashness
in
half
an
hour
kit
braced
himself
as
he
went
up
the
road
in
a
sense
he
was
not
afraid
of
osborn
but
he
had
now
to
meet
a
crisis
that
he
ought
to
have
seen
must
come
in
fact
he
had
seen
it
and
had
rather
weakly
tried
to
cheat
himself
and
put
things
off
he
loved
grace
and
osborn
would
never
approve
kit
knew
osborn
pride
and
admitted
that
his
anger
was
perhaps
not
altogether
unwarranted
for
that
matter
he
doubted
if
grace
knew
how
far
his
rash
hopes
had
led
him
then
he
thrilled
as
he
remembered
that
when
she
pushed
him
back
to
the
hedge
and
afterwards
when
they
left
their
hiding
place
something
had
hinted
that
she
did
know
and
acknowledge
him
her
lover
in
the
meantime
it
was
a
relief
to
drive
the
sheep
down
the
dale
he
could
not
think
while
he
was
occupied
and
thought
was
disturbing
he
put
the
sheep
into
a
field
and
overtook
osborn
as
he
went
up
the
farm
lonning
in
the
dark
a
lamp
burned
in
the
kitchen
and
when
they
went
in
peter
got
up
and
put
his
pipe
on
the
table
he
looked
at
them
with
some
surprise
but
waited
without
embarrassment
indeed
kit
thought
his
father
was
curiously
dignified
osborn
has
something
to
say
he
wants
you
to
hear
kit
remarked
although
the
thing
really
my
business
i
agreed
osborn
refused
the
chair
peter
indicated
and
stood
in
a
stiff
pose
his
face
was
red
and
he
looked
rather
ridiculously
savage
i
found
your
son
and
my
daughter
hiding
from
me
in
the
hedge
at
redmire
wood
he
said
i
imagine
i
entitled
to
ask
for
an
explanation
hiding
said
peter
who
turned
to
kit
that
was
wrong
it
was
wrong
kit
admitted
i
told
osborn
so
in
fact
i
must
have
lost
my
head
when
i
made
a
mistake
like
this
since
i
had
the
honor
of
miss
osborn
acquaintance
who
presented
you
to
my
daughter
osborn
interrupted
nobody
kit
admitted
with
some
embarrassment
the
day
the
otter
hounds
were
hunting
the
alder
pool
miss
osborn
wanted
to
cross
the
stepping
stones
some
of
them
were
covered
and
i
ah
said
osborn
then
the
thing
began
as
long
since
as
that
he
turned
to
peter
the
girl
is
young
and
foolishly
proud
of
being
unconventional
or
she
would
have
known
that
she
could
make
use
of
your
son
help
without
an
obligation
to
speak
to
him
again
it
obvious
that
he
has
worked
on
her
rebellious
humor
until
she
forgot
what
is
due
to
herself
and
her
parents
stop
a
bit
said
peter
she
was
doing
her
parents
no
discredit
by
speaking
to
my
son
no
discredit
osborn
exclaimed
losing
his
self
control
when
i
find
her
and
the
fellow
skulking
out
of
sight
like
a
farm
hand
and
a
kit
raised
his
head
and
his
eyes
sparkled
in
a
sense
i
am
a
farm
hand
but
it
would
be
better
if
you
kept
your
hard
words
for
me
there
are
verra
good
dairymaids
modest
hardworking
lasses
peter
remarked
it
rather
late
to
play
the
part
of
a
rustic
cavalier
if
that
is
what
you
meant
osborn
said
to
kit
with
a
sneer
and
then
turned
to
peter
i
am
forced
to
own
that
the
girl
deserves
some
blame
although
impulsive
and
unconventional
she
ought
to
have
seen
it
was
ridiculous
to
let
your
son
imagine
they
could
be
friends
you
think
that
was
ridiculous
of
course
said
osborn
with
haughty
surprise
the
absurdity
of
the
thing
is
obvious
weel
said
peter
dryly
i
reckon
they
might
be
friends
without
much
harm
though
i
wad
have
them
gan
farther
although
the
lass
is
yours
the
lad
is
mine
osborn
laughed
scornfully
if
i
understand
you
your
attitude
is
humorous
but
do
you
wish
me
to
believe
you
did
know
what
was
going
on
you
have
made
my
tenants
dissatisfied
and
plotted
against
me
and
now
no
doubt
you
saw
another
means
stop
said
peter
with
stern
quietness
we
have
not
been
good
neebors
though
i
dinna
ken
that
much
fault
o
mine
but
if
you
thowt
i
use
a
foolish
girl
to
hurt
a
man
i
did
like
you
varra
wrang
hooiver
you
came
for
an
explanation
and
i
want
one
too
he
turned
to
kit
you
had
better
tell
us
why
you
kept
up
miss
osborn
acquaintance
withoot
her
father
consent
very
well
said
kit
standing
very
straight
and
holding
up
his
head
i
met
miss
osborn
so
to
speak
by
accident
and
afterwards
we
sometimes
talked
her
beauty
and
talent
were
plain
to
me
at
first
but
it
was
some
time
before
i
knew
i
loved
her
and
then
it
was
too
late
i
knew
my
folly
it
was
a
folly
i
could
conquer
and
now
i
think
i
never
shall
well
i
suppose
i
hoped
that
some
day
things
might
change
do
you
imply
that
grace
knew
what
you
hoped
osborn
asked
no
said
kit
quietly
i
gave
her
no
hint
it
was
plain
that
she
was
willing
we
should
meet
and
talk
like
friends
this
was
not
wrong
not
wrong
that
my
daughter
should
meet
you
secretly
osborn
exclaimed
with
sudden
rage
are
you
foolish
enough
to
imagine
you
and
a
member
of
my
family
could
meet
like
equals
i
have
not
pretended
to
be
miss
osborn
equal
but
the
inequality
i
acknowledge
is
not
what
you
mean
osborn
shrugged
with
scornful
impatience
pshaw
we
let
that
go
you
said
you
hoped
things
might
change
do
you
think
any
change
of
fortune
could
give
you
the
tastes
and
feelings
of
a
gentleman
make
you
a
proper
husband
for
my
daughter
you
know
the
thing
impossible
kit
colored
and
hesitated
and
peter
signed
him
to
be
quiet
these
meetings
must
be
stopped
i
as
much
against
such
a
match
as
i
think
you
are
ah
said
osborn
who
looked
puzzled
you
hinted
something
of
the
kind
i
do
know
that
your
point
of
view
important
but
i
understand
my
meaning
no
varra
hard
to
see
peter
answered
the
lass
is
bonny
and
so
far
as
i
ken
and
kind
but
she
has
been
badly
browt
up
at
an
extravagant
hoose
she
not
can
help
her
husband
except
mayhappen
to
waste
and
she
has
niver
learned
to
work
and
gan
withoot
weel
it
seems
we
are
agreed
miss
osborn
is
no
the
lass
i
would
welcome
for
my
son
wife
osborn
looked
at
him
with
frank
surprise
then
he
said
we
make
an
end
and
turned
to
kit
if
you
speak
to
my
daughter
again
she
will
be
forbidden
to
leave
the
tarnside
grounds
if
you
write
to
her
your
letter
will
be
burned
she
can
not
resist
my
control
for
the
next
three
or
four
years
there
nothing
more
to
be
said
he
went
out
and
peter
who
walked
to
the
porch
with
him
came
back
and
looked
quietly
at
kit
a
proud
and
foolish
man
but
he
hit
hard
he
said
mayhappen
it
will
hurt
my
lad
but
you
must
be
done
wi
this
osborn
daughter
is
none
for
you
kit
looked
straight
in
front
with
his
hands
clenched
so
it
seems
for
some
years
it
does
hurt
i
can
not
give
her
up
peter
lighted
his
pipe
and
there
was
silence
for
a
few
minutes
then
as
kit
did
not
move
he
remarked
i
ken
something
o
what
you
feeling
aw
t
same
you
got
to
fratch
there
nowt
against
the
lass
except
that
she
osborn
child
but
she
none
o
our
kind
and
it
sense
and
custom
that
like
gans
to
like
it
would
be
easier
if
i
could
get
away
i
ca
stop
in
the
dale
knowing
she
about
and
i
must
see
her
peter
went
into
the
next
room
and
opened
an
old
desk
he
had
for
some
time
expected
that
the
moment
he
now
shrank
from
would
come
and
his
heart
was
sore
but
he
knew
his
son
steadfast
character
and
meant
to
save
him
pain
going
back
he
gave
kit
his
brother
last
letter
mayhappen
it
better
that
you
should
gan
he
said
quietly
kit
read
the
letter
and
looked
up
with
a
strained
expression
i
never
thought
i
want
to
leave
ashness
and
i
feel
a
selfish
brute
all
the
same
it
would
be
a
relief
just
that
said
peter
i
miss
you
when
you
gone
but
it
my
part
to
stand
in
your
way
we
write
adam
and
tell
him
you
come
kit
crossed
the
floor
and
put
his
hand
on
his
father
arm
thanks
i
think
i
know
what
this
means
to
you
it
will
cost
me
something
but
i
must
go
he
went
out
and
peter
sat
still
looking
gloomily
at
the
fire
he
felt
old
and
knew
he
would
be
very
lonely
soon
the
fire
burned
low
and
the
kitchen
got
cold
but
kit
did
not
come
back
and
when
peter
heard
his
housekeeper
clogs
on
the
stones
outside
he
got
up
and
crossed
the
floor
to
get
his
hat
old
bella
was
curious
and
he
did
not
want
to
talk
but
there
was
something
to
be
done
in
the
barn
and
when
his
heart
was
sore
it
was
a
relief
to
work
part
ii
on
the
caribbean
chapter
i
the
old
buccaneer
it
was
about
four
in
the
afternoon
and
kit
askew
lounged
in
a
chair
on
the
as
the
steamed
slowly
across
the
long
swell
of
the
caribbean
the
wrinkled
undulations
sparkled
with
reflected
light
in
a
dazzling
pattern
of
blue
and
silver
and
then
faded
to
green
and
purple
in
the
shadow
of
the
ship
a
wave
of
snowy
foam
curled
up
as
the
bows
went
down
and
the
throb
of
the
propeller
quickened
as
the
poop
swung
against
the
sky
then
the
lurching
hull
steadied
and
the
clang
of
engines
resumed
its
measured
beat
the
was
old
and
ugly
with
short
iron
masts
from
which
clumsy
derricks
hung
tall
upright
funnel
and
blistered
gray
paint
her
boats
were
dirty
and
stained
by
soot
and
a
belt
of
rust
at
her
waterline
hinted
at
neglect
but
no
barnacles
and
weed
marred
the
smoothness
of
the
plates
below
her
antifouling
paint
was
clean
and
her
lines
beneath
the
swell
of
quarter
and
bows
were
fine
in
fact
the
was
faster
than
she
looked
when
she
carried
her
regular
load
of
two
thousand
tons
and
her
body
was
hidden
she
traded
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
the
caribbean
and
at
certain
ports
customs
officials
carefully
scrutinized
her
papers
at
others
they
smiled
and
allowed
her
captain
privileges
that
strangers
did
not
get
kit
wore
spotless
white
clothes
a
belt
and
a
panama
hat
of
the
expensive
kind
the
indians
weave
holding
the
fine
material
under
water
a
glass
occupied
a
socket
in
his
chair
and
when
the
rolled
a
lump
of
ice
tinkled
against
its
rim
a
box
of
choice
cigars
lay
on
the
deck
kit
however
was
not
smoking
but
drowsily
pondered
the
life
he
had
led
for
the
last
three
years
he
was
thinner
and
looked
older
than
when
he
left
ashness
he
had
lost
something
of
his
frankness
and
his
raw
enthusiasm
had
gone
his
face
was
quieter
and
his
mouth
set
in
a
firm
line
he
remembered
his
surprise
when
he
first
met
his
uncle
at
a
luxurious
florida
hotel
adam
askew
wore
loose
white
clothes
a
tuxedo
jacket
a
diamond
ring
and
another
big
diamond
in
his
scarf
his
skin
was
a
curious
yellowish
brown
and
his
eyes
were
very
black
he
rather
looked
like
a
spanish
creole
than
an
englishman
he
had
nothing
of
his
brother
quiet
manner
although
he
was
getting
old
he
walked
with
a
jaunty
step
he
had
a
humorous
twinkle
and
his
laugh
was
careless
in
fact
he
had
an
exotic
romantic
look
that
harmonized
with
kit
notions
of
the
pirates
who
once
haunted
the
gulf
of
mexico
when
kit
afterwards
learned
why
adam
friends
called
him
the
buccaneer
he
saw
that
his
first
impression
was
not
extravagant
now
he
remembered
that
when
they
sat
behind
the
imitation
moorish
arches
on
the
hotel
veranda
adam
studied
him
and
laughed
you
certainly
peter
son
he
remarked
i
can
imagine
i
just
left
him
at
the
end
of
the
ashness
lonning
thirty
years
since
except
that
he
got
older
i
reckon
he
has
changed
and
for
that
matter
peter
was
never
young
well
you
are
surely
like
him
but
if
you
stop
in
this
country
we
put
a
move
on
you
if
i
like
my
father
i
am
satisfied
kit
rejoined
adam
black
eyes
twinkled
now
i
see
a
difference
there
red
blood
in
you
but
do
take
me
wrong
peter
a
white
man
straight
as
a
one
of
the
best
he
a
year
the
younger
of
us
but
when
the
old
man
died
he
brought
me
up
there
are
two
kinds
of
askews
and
i
belong
to
the
other
lot
i
do
know
why
they
called
you
after
roystering
kit
it
was
obvious
that
adam
knew
the
family
history
for
christopher
askew
was
a
turbulent
jacobite
who
lost
the
most
part
of
his
estate
when
he
joined
prince
charlie
starving
highlanders
in
the
rearguard
fight
at
clifton
moor
afterwards
the
sober
quietness
at
ashness
had
now
and
then
been
disturbed
by
an
askew
who
inherited
the
first
kit
reckless
temperament
three
years
had
gone
since
kit
met
adam
and
he
had
learned
much
to
begin
with
adam
sent
him
to
an
american
business
school
and
made
him
study
castilian
and
french
then
he
sent
him
to
mexico
and
countries
farther
south
where
he
studied
human
nature
of
strangely
varied
kinds
he
met
and
traded
with
men
of
many
colors
french
and
spanish
creoles
negroes
indians
and
with
some
of
the
blood
of
all
he
knew
the
american
gulf
ports
and
their
cosmopolitan
hotels
and
gambling
saloons
but
adam
noted
with
approval
that
while
he
was
not
at
all
a
prig
he
developed
peter
character
and
not
kit
the
jacobite
now
they
were
going
south
across
the
caribbean
on
a
business
venture
by
and
by
adam
came
slowly
along
the
the
three
years
had
marked
a
change
in
him
and
kit
thought
he
did
not
look
well
adam
suffered
now
and
then
from
malarial
ague
caught
in
the
mangrove
swamps
he
was
thin
his
yellow
face
was
haggard
and
his
shoulders
were
bent
sitting
down
close
by
he
lighted
a
cigar
and
turned
to
kit
we
ought
to
raise
the
coast
before
it
dark
and
i
reckon
mayne
will
get
his
bearings
he
remarked
the
lagoon
a
blamed
awkward
place
to
enter
and
i
have
waited
until
only
that
don
hernando
is
expecting
us
it
will
save
us
a
day
if
we
can
get
in
since
you
want
to
land
the
cargo
in
the
dark
kit
said
thoughtfully
we
pay
high
wages
and
the
is
an
expensive
boat
to
run
that
so
adam
agreed
with
a
smile
you
talk
like
a
cumberland
counting
every
cent
you
spend
is
a
safe
plan
but
i
know
that
this
trip
will
pan
out
much
of
a
business
proposition
do
you
feel
better
for
your
sleep
kit
asked
some
though
i
got
a
headache
and
a
pain
in
my
back
guess
shake
off
when
i
get
to
work
i
was
surprised
when
you
said
you
meant
to
sail
with
us
so
i
imagined
adam
rejoined
dryly
you
wondered
why
i
did
as
usual
trust
you
to
deliver
the
goods
well
there
rather
more
to
this
job
than
that
and
i
meant
to
put
you
wise
before
we
landed
you
have
heard
me
called
a
pirate
but
i
do
reckon
on
taking
home
much
plunder
now
kit
mused
while
adam
beckoned
a
mulatto
steward
who
brought
him
a
glass
and
some
ice
his
uncle
character
was
complex
sometimes
he
was
hard
and
exacted
all
that
was
his
sometimes
he
was
rashly
generous
ostensibly
he
was
a
merchant
shipping
tools
and
machines
particularly
supplies
for
sugar
mills
to
the
countries
round
the
caribbean
and
taking
payment
in
native
produce
kit
however
knew
the
cases
landed
from
the
did
not
always
hold
the
goods
the
labels
stated
and
that
adam
money
sometimes
helped
to
float
an
unpopular
government
over
a
crisis
and
sometimes
to
turn
another
out
it
was
a
risky
business
carried
on
with
people
who
had
a
talent
for
dark
revolutionary
intrigue
since
don
hernando
alvarez
is
president
of
the
republic
i
do
quite
see
why
we
need
smuggle
in
his
kit
remarked
on
the
surface
the
reason
is
very
obvious
alvarez
is
president
now
but
may
be
very
long
it
depends
on
whether
he
or
his
rival
galdar
gets
his
blow
in
first
i
reckon
the
chances
are
against
alvarez
if
galdar
puts
up
a
fight
but
the
latter
not
ready
yet
and
alvarez
means
to
arm
his
troops
before
the
fellow
knows
i
imagine
about
half
the
citizens
are
plotters
and
spies
alvarez
has
been
honest
so
far
i
suppose
if
he
wins
he
pay
that
so
said
adam
dryly
if
he
goes
down
we
get
nothing
although
i
do
know
much
about
his
ancestors
and
suspect
that
one
was
an
indian
alvarez
is
white
but
the
other
fellow
a
blamed
poor
sample
of
the
nigger
well
when
alvarez
found
things
were
going
wrong
he
sent
for
me
ah
said
kit
in
a
thoughtful
voice
i
begin
to
understand
he
did
understand
although
he
would
not
have
done
so
when
he
met
his
uncle
first
he
had
known
adam
play
the
part
of
a
merciless
creditor
and
thought
few
men
could
beat
him
at
a
bargain
but
he
kept
his
bargain
when
it
was
made
and
now
and
then
risked
his
money
on
lost
causes
it
looked
as
if
he
had
inherited
something
from
christopher
the
jacobite
you
have
known
alvarez
long
have
you
kit
resumed
when
i
met
him
first
he
was
a
customs
officer
with
some
perquisites
and
a
salary
that
paid
for
liquor
and
tobacco
vanhuyten
and
i
ran
the
old
then
and
van
made
a
mistake
that
put
us
at
the
mercy
there
was
a
good
case
for
confiscating
the
schooner
which
would
have
given
alvarez
a
lift
while
we
went
broke
in
fact
the
night
of
the
crisis
i
dropped
van
pistol
overboard
he
got
malaria
badly
and
was
feeling
desperate
well
all
we
had
given
alvarez
did
cover
that
kind
of
a
job
but
he
promised
to
stand
our
friend
and
kept
his
word
like
a
gentleman
guess
it
needed
some
nerve
and
judgment
to
work
things
the
way
he
did
and
when
we
stole
out
to
sea
at
daybreak
past
the
port
guard
i
knew
there
was
one
man
in
the
rotten
country
i
could
trust
with
my
life
now
he
in
a
tight
place
he
knows
he
can
trust
me
adam
got
up
and
crossing
the
deck
leaned
against
the
rails
in
the
distance
where
the
glitter
faded
there
was
a
long
gray
smear
that
seemed
to
float
like
a
above
the
water
higher
up
a
vague
blue
line
ran
across
the
dazzling
sky
the
first
was
a
fringe
of
mangrove
forest
the
other
lofty
mountains
a
minute
or
two
later
the
fat
captain
came
down
from
his
bridge
looks
like
the
punta
we
hit
her
first
time
he
remarked
in
about
an
hour
i
ought
to
get
my
marks
when
want
her
taken
in
soon
as
it
dark
adam
replied
you
have
to
trust
your
lead
and
compass
ca
have
you
whistling
for
a
pilot
and
i
sooner
you
put
out
your
lights
it
your
risk
and
not
the
first
time
i
broken
rules
i
guess
i
can
keep
her
off
the
ground
we
get
busy
presently
and
heave
the
hatches
off
the
cases
are
right
on
top
adam
nodded
and
beckoned
kit
when
the
captain
went
away
you
been
in
the
santa
marta
lagoon
yet
stand
by
and
watch
the
soundings
and
compass
while
mayne
takes
her
across
the
shoals
you
may
find
it
useful
to
know
the
channel
kit
understood
malaria
and
other
fevers
are
common
on
belts
of
the
caribbean
coast
and
skippers
and
mates
fall
sick
moreover
the
did
not
always
load
at
the
regular
ports
sometimes
she
crept
into
lagoons
and
sometimes
stopped
at
lonely
beaches
and
sent
loaded
boats
ashore
when
her
captain
saw
the
gleam
of
signal
lights
when
it
was
getting
dark
kit
and
adam
went
to
the
bridge
and
the
former
noted
that
his
uncle
breathed
rather
hard
and
seized
the
rails
firmly
as
he
climbed
the
ladder
the
red
glow
of
sunset
had
faded
behind
the
high
land
and
a
gray
haze
spread
across
the
swampy
shore
but
the
water
shone
with
pale
reflections
on
one
side
a
long
dingy
smear
floated
across
the
sky
it
did
not
move
and
kit
thought
it
had
come
from
the
funnel
of
a
steamer
whose
engineer
had
afterwards
cleaned
his
fires
captain
mayne
studied
the
fleecy
trail
with
his
glasses
i
do
know
if
that
a
going
north
i
ca
make
out
her
hull
against
the
land
he
said
sometimes
there
a
hanging
round
the
point
better
take
no
chances
adam
replied
glancing
at
the
funnel
from
which
a
faint
plume
of
vapor
floated
mayne
signed
to
the
quartermaster
in
the
pilot
house
and
the
bows
swung
round
half
an
hour
afterwards
he
rang
his
telegraph
and
the
clang
of
engines
died
away
while
the
throb
of
the
propeller
stopped
in
what
seemed
an
unnatural
silence
a
few
barefooted
began
to
move
about
and
one
stood
on
the
forecastle
where
his
dark
figure
cut
against
the
shining
sea
the
rest
went
aft
with
a
line
the
other
held
and
when
mayne
raised
his
hand
there
was
a
splash
as
the
lead
plunged
a
man
aft
called
the
depth
while
he
gathered
up
the
line
and
mayne
beckoned
another
who
climbed
to
a
little
platform
outside
the
bridge
and
fastened
a
strap
round
his
waist
we
on
the
santa
marta
shelf
but
i
four
miles
off
the
course
i
set
mayne
remarked
i
want
to
work
out
the
angle
from
the
first
bearing
i
got
kit
went
with
him
into
the
for
he
knew
something
about
navigation
they
had
taught
him
the
principles
of
at
the
agricultural
college
and
this
had
made
his
studies
easier
when
he
came
back
the
moon
was
getting
bright
but
the
haze
had
thickened
on
the
low
ground
and
the
heights
behind
had
faded
to
a
vague
formless
blur
the
trail
of
smoke
had
vanished
there
was
no
wind
and
the
smooth
swell
broke
against
the
bows
with
a
monotonous
dull
roar
as
the
went
on
she
was
alone
on
the
heaving
water
and
steaming
slowly
but
the
noise
of
her
progress
carried
far
by
and
by
a
light
twinkled
ahead
leaped
up
into
a
steady
glow
that
lasted
for
some
minutes
and
then
went
out
that
a
relief
remarked
adam
who
had
struck
a
match
and
studied
his
watch
the
ground
clear
and
don
hernando
has
somebody
he
can
trust
waiting
at
the
lagoon
you
can
let
her
go
ahead
captain
mayne
rang
his
telegraph
and
kit
went
into
the
pilot
house
the
dim
light
of
the
binnacle
lamp
touched
the
compass
but
everything
else
was
dark
and
the
windows
were
down
kit
could
see
the
quartermaster
dark
form
behind
the
wheel
and
the
silver
shining
of
the
sea
there
was
a
splash
as
the
man
on
the
platform
released
the
whirling
when
he
called
the
depth
mayne
gave
an
order
and
the
quartermaster
pulled
round
the
wheel
the
swell
was
not
so
smooth
now
it
ran
in
steep
undulations
and
in
one
place
to
starboard
a
broad
foaming
patch
appeared
between
the
rollers
kit
knew
the
water
was
shoaling
fast
as
the
steamed
across
the
inclined
shelf
it
was
risky
work
to
take
her
in
because
the
fire
had
vanished
and
there
were
no
marks
to
steer
for
mayne
must
trust
his
compass
and
his
rough
calculations
tide
running
flood
he
said
to
adam
she
have
steered
handier
if
we
gone
in
against
the
ebb
but
there
a
better
chance
of
coming
off
if
she
touches
ground
you
do
want
to
touch
ground
and
stop
there
with
the
goods
on
board
adam
replied
after
this
there
was
silence
except
when
mayne
gave
an
order
white
upheavals
broke
the
passing
swell
on
both
sides
of
the
ship
she
rolled
with
violent
jerks
and
at
regular
intervals
the
bows
swung
up
when
they
sank
a
dark
mass
with
a
ragged
top
cut
off
the
view
from
the
and
kit
knew
it
was
a
mangrove
forest
he
could
see
no
break
in
the
wall
of
trees
that
grew
out
of
the
water
but
they
were
not
far
off
when
there
was
a
heavy
jar
and
the
rio
negro
stopped
the
floor
of
the
slanted
and
kit
and
the
quartermaster
fell
against
the
wheel
then
there
was
a
roar
as
a
roller
came
up
astern
and
broke
about
the
vessel
rail
in
boiling
foam
she
lifted
struck
again
and
went
on
with
an
awkward
lurch
port
hard
over
mayne
shouted
hoarsely
and
kit
helped
the
quartermaster
to
pull
round
the
wheel
the
order
disturbed
him
since
it
looked
as
if
mayne
was
off
his
course
the
swell
broke
angrily
ahead
but
in
one
place
some
distance
to
one
side
the
wall
of
forest
looked
less
solid
than
the
rest
a
roar
came
out
of
the
mist
and
kit
knew
it
was
the
beat
of
surf
on
a
hidden
beach
this
told
him
where
he
was
because
a
sandy
key
protected
the
mouth
of
the
lagoon
but
he
doubted
if
mayne
could
get
round
the
point
the
tide
was
carrying
the
vessel
on
and
there
was
broken
water
all
about
she
went
on
with
engines
thumping
steadily
the
hollow
in
the
forest
opened
up
until
it
became
a
gap
and
kit
could
not
see
trees
behind
it
mayne
gave
another
sharp
order
and
kit
and
the
quartermaster
pulled
at
the
wheel
the
dark
bows
swung
the
speed
quickened
and
the
rolling
stopped
the
throb
of
the
screw
and
thump
of
engines
echoed
across
misty
woods
and
there
was
a
curious
gurgling
noise
that
kit
thought
was
made
by
the
tide
rippling
among
the
mangrove
roots
the
air
got
damp
and
steamy
and
a
sour
smell
filled
the
kit
knew
the
odors
of
rotting
leaves
spices
and
warm
mud
in
the
meantime
he
was
kept
occupied
at
the
wheel
for
mayne
changed
his
course
as
the
trees
rolled
past
until
the
telegraph
rang
and
the
engines
stopped
then
there
was
silence
until
he
heard
the
splash
of
the
anchor
and
the
roar
of
running
chain
as
the
slowly
swung
round
the
winches
rattled
and
her
boats
were
hoisted
out
kit
got
into
one
with
adam
and
landed
on
a
muddy
beach
dark
figures
came
down
to
meet
them
horses
were
waiting
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
a
few
minutes
later
they
mounted
and
plunged
into
the
gloom
chapter
ii
the
presidio
dazzling
sunshine
flooded
the
belt
of
sand
where
the
shadows
of
dusty
palmettos
quivered
beyond
the
moorish
arch
the
old
presidio
smelt
like
a
and
the
heat
outside
was
nearly
intolerable
in
the
middle
of
the
dirty
patio
a
fountain
splashed
in
a
broken
marble
basin
and
it
was
dim
and
by
contrast
cool
under
the
arcade
where
kit
sat
among
the
crumbling
pillars
the
presidio
was
a
relic
of
spanish
dominion
and
its
founders
had
built
it
well
copying
with
such
materials
as
they
could
get
stately
models
the
moors
had
left
in
the
distant
peninsula
a
part
had
fallen
and
blocks
of
mud
lay
about
in
piles
but
the
long
white
front
with
its
battlemented
top
and
narrow
barred
windows
stood
firm
in
spite
of
the
ruinous
patio
the
presidio
was
the
finest
building
in
the
town
the
others
so
far
as
kit
could
see
were
squares
of
mud
for
the
most
part
whitewashed
although
some
were
colored
pink
and
cream
the
glare
they
reflected
was
dazzling
but
a
row
of
limp
palmettos
ran
between
them
and
the
space
in
front
of
the
presidio
and
here
and
there
kit
noted
rounded
masses
of
vivid
green
except
for
the
splash
of
the
fountain
all
was
very
quiet
and
although
the
shadows
had
lengthened
it
looked
as
if
the
citizens
were
still
enjoying
their
afternoon
sleep
now
and
then
a
barefooted
sentry
noiselessly
passed
the
arch
he
wore
a
dirty
white
uniform
and
ragged
hat
but
carried
a
good
modern
rifle
and
kit
knew
where
the
latter
had
come
from
the
country
was
rich
with
coffee
rubber
sugar
and
dyewoods
its
inhabitants
however
for
the
most
part
preferred
political
intrigue
to
cultivation
its
government
was
corrupt
and
prosperity
had
vanished
with
the
spaniards
firm
rule
a
table
carrying
some
very
small
glasses
and
stood
in
the
arcade
don
hernando
alvarez
occupied
the
other
side
and
kit
imagined
it
was
not
by
accident
he
sat
with
his
back
to
a
whitewashed
pillar
since
he
was
in
the
shadow
and
as
he
wore
white
clothes
could
not
be
seen
a
short
distance
off
don
hernando
hair
was
coarse
and
his
skin
dark
his
face
was
well
molded
although
the
were
prominent
his
black
eyes
were
keen
and
his
thin
lips
firm
he
wore
a
plain
red
sash
with
no
other
touch
of
color
except
a
bit
of
riband
on
his
breast
it
was
obvious
that
he
was
not
a
peninsular
as
spaniards
call
themselves
but
he
looked
like
a
man
who
must
be
reckoned
on
just
then
his
dark
face
was
moody
you
have
come
in
good
time
he
said
to
adam
askew
in
castilian
i
think
the
curtain
will
soon
go
up
for
the
last
act
of
the
drama
but
the
plot
is
obscure
and
i
do
not
know
the
end
i
imagine
the
action
will
be
rapid
adam
replied
unless
you
have
changed
much
you
are
cut
out
for
your
part
ah
said
alvarez
one
gets
cautious
as
one
gets
old
one
loses
the
young
man
quick
sure
touch
that
is
so
to
some
extent
adam
agreed
and
indicated
kit
it
explains
why
i
have
a
partner
my
brother
son
still
perhaps
one
sees
farther
when
one
is
old
alvarez
bowed
to
kit
you
have
a
good
model
señor
a
man
who
seldom
hesitates
and
whose
word
goes
a
rare
thing
in
this
country
i
do
not
know
about
yours
then
he
turned
to
adam
with
a
hint
of
anxiety
how
far
do
you
see
now
i
see
what
i
have
to
do
and
that
is
enough
the
consequences
come
afterwards
alvarez
face
cleared
you
were
always
a
gambler
but
you
run
some
risk
if
you
bet
on
me
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
resumed
in
a
sense
i
envy
you
you
have
a
partner
you
can
trust
but
i
stand
alone
my
son
was
found
in
the
plaza
with
a
knife
in
his
back
and
the
man
who
killed
him
goes
unpunished
galdar
was
somewhere
behind
that
deed
although
i
do
not
see
his
object
yet
adam
remarked
the
people
liked
maccario
and
his
removal
cleared
the
ground
my
enemy
is
cunning
and
i
think
did
not
mean
to
force
a
conflict
until
my
friends
had
gone
now
there
are
not
many
left
and
the
time
has
come
morales
died
of
poison
diaz
of
and
vinoles
was
shot
by
a
curious
accident
so
far
i
have
escaped
perhaps
because
i
was
lucky
and
perhaps
because
it
was
not
certain
the
people
would
choose
galdar
if
i
followed
my
friends
i
have
wondered
why
you
hold
on
for
a
president
of
this
country
you
have
had
a
good
run
i
think
i
would
have
left
after
a
few
prosperous
years
and
located
at
havana
for
example
alvarez
smiled
there
was
a
time
when
we
had
money
in
the
treasury
and
i
might
have
gone
but
it
was
too
late
afterwards
part
of
the
revenue
stopped
in
galdar
hands
that
was
one
way
of
embarrassing
me
and
i
was
forced
to
use
the
rest
to
undermine
his
plots
now
i
am
drawing
on
my
small
private
estate
but
why
did
you
go
while
there
was
something
left
you
are
not
extravagant
and
do
not
need
much
kit
thought
adam
remark
was
justified
alvarez
lived
with
indian
frugality
and
looked
ascetic
besides
he
had
been
long
in
power
and
had
no
doubt
had
opportunities
for
enriching
himself
at
his
expense
kit
liked
alvarez
but
did
not
think
him
much
honester
than
other
rulers
he
had
met
it
was
partly
for
my
daughter
sake
i
remained
alvarez
replied
she
is
at
a
spanish
convent
and
i
would
not
leave
her
poor
then
i
had
my
son
death
to
avenge
he
paused
and
added
with
a
deprecatory
smile
moreover
i
have
thought
i
can
rule
this
country
better
than
my
rival
that
a
sure
thing
adam
agreed
in
english
well
you
had
better
tell
me
how
you
think
matters
are
going
if
i
to
help
you
properly
i
want
to
know
alvarez
looked
about
all
was
very
quiet
there
was
nobody
in
the
patio
and
it
was
some
distance
to
the
nearest
window
in
the
wall
that
faced
the
pillars
for
all
that
he
lowered
his
voice
and
answered
in
hesitating
english
with
an
american
accent
it
is
hard
to
tell
a
gamble
in
which
one
takes
steep
chances
perhaps
half
the
people
with
an
object
are
for
galdar
and
half
for
me
those
who
have
none
will
wait
and
back
the
man
they
think
will
win
so
far
i
have
the
soldiers
but
their
pay
is
behind
and
they
are
badly
armed
and
drilled
they
will
stand
by
me
if
i
can
give
them
and
pay
off
arrears
but
this
must
be
done
soon
without
galdar
knowing
the
next
president
will
be
the
man
who
strikes
before
the
other
is
ready
what
will
the
thing
cost
altogether
adam
asked
he
looked
thoughtful
when
alvarez
told
him
and
then
nodded
all
right
you
get
some
of
the
guns
and
another
lot
is
on
the
way
go
ahead
i
help
you
put
the
business
over
alvarez
filled
the
little
glasses
with
a
liquor
that
had
a
strong
spicy
smell
and
when
his
guests
lifted
them
touched
theirs
with
his
it
is
what
i
had
hoped
my
friend
if
i
live
you
will
not
lose
he
drank
and
then
held
his
glass
slackly
poised
while
he
mused
kit
who
was
nearest
the
arch
turned
and
glanced
out
he
saw
the
reflected
light
quiver
across
the
trampled
sand
and
the
dusty
green
of
the
limp
palmettos
then
below
the
latter
there
was
a
flash
and
the
president
glass
fell
with
a
tinkle
a
rang
out
and
kit
swinging
round
saw
that
a
flake
of
plaster
had
dropped
on
the
table
there
was
some
dust
on
alvarez
brown
face
and
on
his
clothes
but
he
looked
unmoved
next
moment
adam
leaned
on
the
table
steadying
a
heavy
automatic
pistol
and
three
quick
flashes
streamed
from
the
perking
barrel
three
small
puffs
of
dust
leaped
up
about
the
roots
of
a
palmetto
and
as
the
empty
cartridges
rattled
on
the
floor
kit
thought
an
indistinct
figure
stole
through
the
shadow
of
the
leaves
he
was
not
certain
because
the
light
was
dazzling
and
thin
smoke
drifted
about
his
head
he
threw
his
chair
back
and
plunging
through
the
arch
ran
across
the
sand
and
stopped
at
the
top
of
a
narrow
street
men
and
women
of
different
shades
of
color
came
out
of
the
doors
and
began
to
talk
excitedly
but
there
was
nobody
who
looked
like
a
fugitive
kit
went
back
after
he
got
his
breath
and
met
two
or
three
untidy
barefooted
soldiers
who
ran
past
when
he
entered
the
arch
adam
was
coolly
reloading
his
pistol
while
the
president
dusted
his
clothes
it
is
nothing
they
have
tried
again
the
latter
remarked
still
it
looks
as
if
galdar
felt
himself
stronger
than
i
thought
now
with
your
permission
i
will
go
and
give
some
orders
he
smiled
as
he
added
there
will
be
some
prisoners
by
and
by
men
my
guards
do
not
like
but
the
fellow
who
fired
the
shot
will
not
be
caught
what
about
the
sentry
adam
asked
alvarez
shrugged
it
is
hot
and
perhaps
he
was
half
asleep
i
think
the
man
is
faithful
and
just
now
i
am
the
soldier
friend
he
went
off
and
adam
filled
his
glass
and
looked
at
kit
i
feel
getting
old
and
want
another
drink
i
got
the
bead
on
the
fellow
dark
head
and
missed
him
by
a
yard
well
i
guess
you
ca
expect
to
have
steady
fingers
when
you
got
malarial
ague
it
a
dramatic
kind
of
country
anyhow
kit
lighted
a
cigarette
and
mused
he
had
been
startled
but
his
nerve
was
good
and
he
knew
something
about
the
reckless
people
of
the
south
they
were
robbed
by
their
rulers
who
spent
the
most
part
of
the
revenue
to
keep
themselves
in
power
and
sometimes
when
the
vote
was
useless
assassination
seemed
the
only
remedy
but
it
was
on
his
uncle
promise
kit
thoughts
dwelt
although
adam
was
rich
the
sum
alvarez
needed
was
large
the
latter
was
honest
in
a
sense
and
kit
thought
would
not
rob
his
friend
but
he
might
be
unable
to
make
repayment
in
fact
he
had
warned
adam
that
there
was
a
risk
and
the
bullet
that
struck
the
pillar
was
a
significant
hint
the
venture
looked
rash
but
adam
had
stated
that
it
was
not
a
business
proposition
he
and
the
president
were
friends
and
this
counted
for
much
the
old
buccaneer
had
a
sentimental
vein
then
kit
thoughts
strayed
and
he
wondered
what
peter
was
doing
in
the
north
country
dale
kit
had
prospered
since
he
joined
adam
and
the
latter
had
hinted
that
he
might
be
rich
but
he
was
tired
of
intrigue
and
excitement
and
the
glare
of
the
south
he
wanted
the
bracing
winds
and
the
soft
lights
that
chased
the
flying
shadows
across
the
english
hills
he
smiled
as
he
reflected
that
he
was
like
the
herdwicks
that
never
forgot
their
native
heaf
but
while
he
longed
for
the
red
moors
and
valleys
he
felt
a
stronger
call
he
was
young
and
had
seen
the
daughters
of
the
south
louisiana
creoles
with
a
touch
of
old
french
grace
habaneras
with
languid
eyes
whose
movements
were
a
delight
to
watch
octoroons
ready
to
welcome
a
lover
who
was
altogether
white
and
indian
girls
all
had
charm
and
some
had
shown
him
favors
that
meant
much
but
their
charm
had
left
kit
cold
he
thought
about
grace
osborn
and
marked
by
english
calm
she
was
frank
and
sometimes
impulsive
but
even
then
one
got
a
hint
of
proud
reserve
there
was
no
touch
of
southern
coquetry
about
grace
she
was
not
the
girl
to
attract
a
lover
and
let
him
go
but
if
he
came
and
proved
his
worth
she
would
go
forward
with
him
steadfastly
through
the
storms
of
life
kit
sighed
and
pulled
himself
up
grace
was
not
for
him
and
he
must
not
be
a
romantic
fool
he
looked
round
and
saw
that
adam
was
quietly
studying
him
what
are
you
thinking
about
partner
he
asked
and
kit
knew
the
epithet
meant
much
adam
had
not
called
him
partner
at
first
i
was
thinking
about
ashness
he
replied
ah
said
adam
softly
i
often
think
about
it
too
the
old
house
among
the
ash
trees
and
the
herdwicks
feeding
on
the
long
slope
behind
the
red
heath
on
the
and
the
beck
bubbling
in
the
ghyll
everything
clean
and
cool
in
the
quiet
dale
and
the
folk
are
calm
and
slow
he
paused
and
resumed
with
a
curious
smile
once
i
reckoned
go
back
when
i
got
rich
and
make
things
hum
but
when
i
had
the
money
i
saw
that
plan
would
work
those
quiet
folk
would
have
beaten
me
with
their
unchanging
ways
and
ashness
is
too
good
to
spoil
for
all
that
i
allowed
i
see
it
again
before
i
died
but
now
i
do
know
his
smile
faded
and
he
gave
kit
a
keen
glance
why
did
you
pull
out
it
was
for
my
money
you
have
told
me
yet
no
said
kit
with
some
embarrassment
i
hardly
think
it
much
of
a
story
but
if
you
like
i
tell
you
now
after
a
few
moments
he
stopped
awkwardly
and
adam
raised
his
hand
go
on
i
want
to
get
the
girl
properly
fixed
kit
was
not
skilled
at
sketching
character
but
he
drew
grace
portrait
well
and
when
he
stopped
adam
made
a
sign
of
sympathy
you
have
helped
me
place
her
do
know
i
have
trusted
another
judgment
when
he
talked
about
his
sweetheart
but
you
not
a
fool
well
it
seems
to
me
the
girl
worth
getting
miss
osborn
is
not
my
sweetheart
it
is
possible
i
shall
never
see
her
again
but
you
ca
forget
her
no
said
kit
quietly
i
ca
forget
adam
was
silent
for
some
moments
and
then
looked
up
you
like
peter
slow
and
staunch
but
that
one
reason
you
my
partner
well
i
know
osborn
kind
folk
we
have
no
use
for
in
the
united
states
white
trash
we
call
them
men
with
no
abilities
whose
foolish
pride
makes
them
think
it
mean
to
work
reckon
they
first
claim
on
the
soft
jobs
and
do
belong
to
the
world
of
fighting
men
but
i
guess
they
listen
when
money
talks
kit
said
nothing
although
he
thought
adam
concluding
remark
significant
and
the
old
man
went
on
don
hernando
helped
me
on
my
feet
when
vanhuyten
and
i
first
came
along
this
coast
with
about
a
thousand
dollars
and
a
schooner
been
my
friend
ever
since
and
now
he
hard
up
against
it
i
got
to
see
him
out
guess
it
going
to
cost
me
high
but
when
the
job
put
over
there
ought
to
be
some
money
left
and
i
do
know
that
you
need
forget
the
girl
if
she
has
forgotten
you
well
perhaps
i
said
enough
and
now
i
go
and
see
where
don
hernando
is
adam
got
up
and
as
he
crossed
the
patio
kit
noted
that
his
shoulders
were
bent
and
his
movement
slack
adam
had
changed
much
since
their
first
meeting
at
the
florida
hotel
he
had
some
very
obvious
faults
but
kit
knew
what
he
owed
him
and
felt
disturbed
chapter
iii
the
gold
onza
kit
paused
as
he
wound
the
long
silk
sash
round
his
waist
and
looked
out
of
the
window
of
his
room
at
the
presidio
square
blocks
of
houses
colored
white
and
yellow
ran
down
the
hill
here
and
there
a
palm
rose
from
an
opening
and
the
dusty
green
of
the
alameda
broke
the
monotony
of
the
flat
roofs
and
straight
blank
walls
that
gave
the
town
an
eastern
look
kit
noted
the
strength
of
the
presidio
situation
the
old
building
stood
high
its
battlemented
roof
commanded
the
narrow
streets
and
there
was
a
broad
open
space
all
round
he
thought
a
few
would
make
it
impregnable
since
a
revolutionary
mob
was
not
likely
to
be
provided
with
artillery
kit
tucked
the
end
of
the
sash
under
the
folds
some
time
is
required
to
put
on
a
spanish
and
at
first
kit
had
thought
the
trouble
unnecessary
but
had
found
it
is
prudent
to
protect
the
middle
of
the
body
in
a
hot
climate
when
he
was
satisfied
he
turned
and
looked
about
the
room
there
were
no
curtains
or
carpets
and
two
very
crude
religious
pictures
were
fixed
to
the
wall
although
the
air
was
not
yet
hot
it
was
not
fresh
and
a
smell
of
spices
decay
and
burnt
oil
came
in
through
the
window
that
opened
on
the
patio
a
sunbeam
touched
a
small
earthen
jar
holding
a
bunch
of
feather
flowers
the
jar
was
harshly
colored
but
the
outline
was
bold
and
graceful
and
kit
knew
no
pottery
like
that
had
been
made
in
the
country
since
the
spaniards
came
he
had
bought
it
with
the
flowers
for
a
few
dollars
and
remembered
that
the
shopkeeper
had
included
its
contents
when
he
offered
it
to
him
loque
hay
he
said
in
uncouth
castilian
kit
turning
over
the
jar
carelessly
took
out
the
flowers
and
as
he
did
so
something
inside
rattled
and
a
large
coin
fell
into
his
hand
the
coin
was
old
and
heavy
indeed
he
thought
it
weighed
about
an
ounce
taking
it
to
the
window
he
rubbed
its
dull
face
and
when
the
metal
began
to
shine
sat
down
with
a
thoughtful
look
unless
he
was
mistaken
the
coin
was
gold
and
did
weigh
an
ounce
when
he
finished
dressing
he
went
to
the
little
dark
shop
the
shopkeeper
was
making
coffee
with
a
handful
of
charcoal
on
the
doorstep
for
the
sake
of
the
draught
and
took
off
his
hat
politely
as
kit
came
up
i
found
a
piece
of
money
in
the
jar
i
bought
from
you
kit
said
in
castilian
then
your
worship
is
lucky
the
other
remarked
but
the
money
was
not
mine
the
shopkeeper
shrugged
what
matter
it
is
yours
now
was
the
coin
worth
much
it
was
worth
finding
well
said
the
shopkeeper
i
do
not
know
where
the
money
came
from
and
it
may
have
been
there
a
very
long
time
the
jar
is
old
and
i
bought
it
from
an
indian
some
years
since
he
paused
and
gave
kit
a
keen
glance
you
will
remember
that
i
offered
you
the
jar
with
all
there
was
inside
you
did
it
held
some
feather
flowers
still
as
you
did
know
about
the
money
then
you
want
to
give
it
back
if
the
owner
can
be
found
certainly
said
kit
the
shopkeeper
bowed
i
will
make
enquiries
if
you
should
need
anything
i
sell
señor
perhaps
you
will
remember
that
i
am
an
honest
man
kit
went
away
feeling
puzzled
and
somewhat
surprised
it
looked
as
if
the
fellow
was
honest
but
kit
thought
he
had
studied
him
and
there
was
something
curious
about
his
manner
besides
a
remark
he
made
implied
that
he
knew
the
coin
was
old
when
he
ate
his
eleven
breakfast
with
adam
and
the
president
in
the
arcade
he
took
out
the
coin
and
told
them
about
the
refusal
to
take
it
back
a
spanish
onza
adam
remarked
worth
nearly
five
pounds
in
english
money
but
a
collector
might
give
you
more
if
it
as
old
as
it
looks
one
used
to
see
onzas
in
cuba
and
native
merchants
in
central
america
who
had
much
use
for
banks
liked
to
get
them
now
however
getting
scarce
in
this
country
all
gold
coins
are
scarce
alvarez
said
dryly
i
agree
with
the
shopkeeper
that
don
cristoval
is
fortunate
and
expect
he
feels
that
my
people
are
honester
than
he
thought
i
was
puzzled
said
kit
and
stopped
for
he
saw
the
president
smile
and
began
to
understand
you
are
shrewd
señor
but
that
was
to
be
expected
from
my
old
nephew
to
begin
with
the
man
who
keeps
the
shop
is
not
a
supporter
of
the
government
ah
said
kit
i
think
i
see
alvarez
bowed
one
can
trust
your
intelligence
and
you
can
keep
the
coin
it
looks
as
if
my
antagonists
were
curious
about
your
character
the
honor
of
a
man
who
would
take
money
that
does
not
belong
to
him
is
open
to
doubt
the
experiment
was
cheap
kit
said
nothing
and
the
president
filled
a
little
glass
with
scented
liquor
i
know
my
friends
don
cristoval
and
your
uncle
has
stood
much
harder
tests
he
touched
kit
glass
with
his
well
i
am
lucky
because
i
may
need
friends
soon
he
got
up
and
when
he
went
down
the
long
arcade
adam
looked
at
kit
with
a
smile
when
i
was
your
age
i
would
have
taken
the
onza
back
i
have
kept
the
money
and
my
faith
with
the
president
in
fact
in
those
days
i
kept
anything
i
could
get
now
the
other
fellow
knows
what
you
like
i
reckon
he
find
the
owner
of
the
coin
adam
went
off
after
the
president
and
kit
pondered
a
few
days
later
he
sat
one
evening
at
a
small
table
outside
the
café
bolivar
the
café
was
badly
lighted
hot
and
full
of
flies
there
was
no
door
or
window
and
a
few
wooden
pillars
divided
the
low
room
from
the
pavement
which
was
strewn
with
cigarette
ends
and
cardboard
matches
in
front
small
palms
and
eucalyptus
lined
the
dusty
alameda
where
groups
of
citizens
walked
up
and
down
inside
the
café
somebody
sang
a
spanish
song
and
played
a
guitar
it
was
not
cool
on
the
pavement
although
a
faint
breeze
made
the
palms
rustle
the
air
was
heavy
and
a
smell
of
aniseed
and
new
rum
hung
about
the
spot
presently
a
man
who
had
been
playing
dominos
got
up
and
came
to
table
he
was
a
white
man
with
pale
blue
eyes
and
yellow
hair
and
although
rather
fat
he
carried
himself
well
kit
had
met
olsen
before
and
he
nodded
when
he
sat
down
nothing
doing
at
the
casino
and
the
place
was
very
hot
he
said
besides
i
do
quite
trust
the
man
who
runs
the
bank
taking
them
all
round
these
folks
are
clever
crooks
kit
agreed
languidly
and
noted
the
order
olsen
gave
the
landlord
the
fellow
did
not
look
as
if
he
indulged
much
but
kit
thought
a
large
glass
of
the
strong
liquor
was
not
often
asked
for
as
a
rule
the
americans
he
had
met
on
the
caribbean
coast
were
abstemious
while
the
and
spaniards
were
satisfied
with
small
of
fiery
spirits
distilled
from
the
sugar
cane
the
english
german
and
scandinavian
adventurers
consumed
them
freely
and
perhaps
the
germans
drank
the
most
how
do
you
like
it
here
olsen
resumed
when
he
put
down
his
glass
it
a
country
that
soon
palls
are
you
staying
long
i
ca
tell
said
kit
who
decided
not
to
state
that
he
knew
the
country
you
see
i
not
in
command
no
said
olsen
i
suppose
you
a
relation
of
the
buccaneer
a
poor
relation
he
gave
me
a
lift
when
i
needed
it
olsen
laughed
well
i
guess
he
makes
you
hustle
a
pretty
lively
old
pirate
if
all
one
hears
is
true
i
reckon
they
do
call
him
the
buccaneer
for
nothing
but
it
hinted
that
he
beginning
to
lose
his
grip
i
see
your
copita
empty
will
you
take
another
drink
no
thanks
i
had
enough
said
kit
who
distrusted
olsen
he
thought
the
fellow
careless
remarks
covered
some
curiosity
and
had
tried
to
leave
him
in
doubt
olsen
probably
imagined
he
was
adam
clerk
you
cautious
but
one
soon
gets
reckless
here
olsen
resumed
we
are
all
adventurers
out
for
what
we
can
get
and
the
chances
against
our
making
good
are
pretty
steep
my
notion
is
to
have
the
best
time
i
can
pick
up
as
much
money
as
possible
and
quit
before
fever
intrigue
or
a
revolution
knocks
me
out
it
an
exciting
life
kit
agreed
money
does
seem
plentiful
you
have
got
to
hustle
and
back
the
right
man
since
you
stopping
at
the
presidio
it
obvious
that
askew
on
the
president
side
well
i
suppose
everybody
knows
my
employers
have
put
their
money
on
galdar
then
i
imagine
you
run
some
risk
sure
said
olsen
smiling
alvarez
does
like
me
and
if
i
was
an
american
citizen
i
feel
scared
showed
his
secretary
my
naturalization
papers
when
i
put
up
my
shingle
took
them
out
as
soon
as
i
reached
the
united
states
from
norway
kit
pondered
olsen
spoke
english
and
castilian
well
but
his
accent
was
not
american
nor
kit
thought
scandinavian
there
were
a
number
of
germans
in
the
country
engaged
in
extensive
but
rather
dark
commercial
schemes
whom
the
united
states
consuls
watched
with
jealous
eyes
kit
knew
that
no
one
could
transact
much
business
without
to
some
extent
meddling
with
native
politics
but
while
the
other
adventurers
were
satisfied
with
the
money
they
could
get
it
looked
as
if
the
germans
wanted
something
else
it
was
perhaps
significant
that
olsen
had
so
to
speak
insisted
that
he
was
a
naturalized
american
and
came
from
norway
kit
doubted
askew
judgment
is
generally
pretty
good
but
he
getting
old
olsen
remarked
i
do
see
why
he
backing
the
president
my
notion
is
galdar
surely
going
to
win
he
paused
and
looked
at
kit
thoughtfully
in
fact
if
i
was
holding
a
clerk
job
on
the
other
side
i
consider
if
it
would
pay
me
to
change
kit
imagined
this
was
a
cautious
feeler
made
to
find
out
if
he
could
be
bought
but
he
smiled
if
galdar
does
win
he
wo
have
much
to
give
his
friends
he
certainly
wo
have
much
money
olsen
agreed
it
going
to
cost
him
all
he
can
raise
to
turn
alvarez
out
but
he
have
something
to
give
at
the
country
expense
sugar
and
coffee
concessions
and
perhaps
monopolies
if
i
can
get
my
share
it
will
pay
my
employers
well
and
i
allow
they
generous
he
stopped
as
if
he
thought
he
had
said
enough
and
after
ordering
another
drink
looked
up
with
a
grin
two
girls
in
light
dresses
had
passed
the
café
once
or
twice
with
a
male
companion
and
a
fat
old
woman
who
wore
black
clothes
kit
had
not
noticed
them
particularly
because
other
groups
were
moving
about
but
he
now
remarked
that
the
man
had
gone
and
the
was
a
yard
or
two
in
front
one
of
the
girls
looked
round
and
he
thought
her
glance
searched
the
café
and
then
stopped
at
his
table
the
señorita
a
looker
said
olsen
i
wonder
which
of
us
she
fancies
she
been
round
this
way
before
i
not
remarkably
handsome
and
there
are
other
people
in
the
café
kit
replied
anyhow
i
do
want
to
get
a
jealous
señorita
knife
in
my
back
you
a
blamed
cautious
fellow
olsen
rejoined
in
a
meaning
tone
however
you
find
me
at
the
casino
evenings
if
you
feel
you
like
a
talk
and
now
i
get
along
he
went
off
and
kit
smoked
another
cigarette
he
thought
olsen
had
so
to
speak
been
sounding
him
the
fellow
had
certainly
given
him
some
hints
kit
imagined
he
had
taken
a
prudent
line
by
keeping
the
other
in
the
dark
about
his
partnership
with
adam
and
their
plans
when
he
had
smoked
his
cigarette
he
crossed
the
street
to
the
alameda
and
went
up
a
broad
walk
beneath
the
trees
the
sky
had
cleared
the
moon
was
high
and
in
front
of
the
openings
pools
of
silver
light
lay
upon
the
ground
by
and
by
kit
saw
the
group
he
had
noticed
a
few
yards
ahead
they
were
moving
slowly
and
although
he
walked
no
faster
he
soon
came
up
with
them
the
girl
who
had
looked
into
the
café
was
nearest
and
the
moonlight
touched
her
face
as
she
turned
her
head
kit
gave
her
a
half
curious
glance
and
felt
some
surprise
for
he
could
see
her
better
now
and
thought
her
a
spaniard
the
were
aristocrats
the
girl
had
a
touch
of
dignity
and
her
dress
was
rich
it
was
strange
if
a
girl
like
that
was
willing
to
defy
conventions
and
risk
an
intrigue
with
a
stranger
yet
he
imagined
he
had
seen
her
smile
and
she
carried
a
little
bunch
of
purple
flowers
in
the
hand
nearest
him
he
looked
again
and
saw
that
she
was
beautiful
and
moved
with
the
grace
that
generally
marks
the
when
they
are
young
the
path
was
broad
and
he
could
keep
level
with
the
group
without
exciting
curiosity
but
he
thought
it
curious
that
the
fat
old
woman
who
ought
to
have
guarded
the
others
was
in
front
he
resolved
to
go
past
and
just
before
he
did
so
the
girl
gave
him
a
glance
that
he
thought
was
half
amused
and
half
provocative
then
she
turned
her
head
and
next
moment
he
saw
a
flower
near
his
feet
he
noted
a
faint
smell
of
heliotrope
and
knew
she
had
dropped
the
flower
for
him
this
meant
something
although
it
would
not
have
much
significance
unless
he
picked
up
the
heliotrope
he
did
not
and
walking
past
with
a
quicker
step
heard
a
soft
laugh
when
he
reached
the
presidio
he
sat
down
on
the
balcony
that
overlooked
the
patio
outside
his
room
there
was
nobody
about
and
he
began
to
muse
it
was
rash
to
take
things
for
granted
but
he
thought
he
had
been
made
the
subject
of
three
experiments
somebody
had
put
a
gold
onza
in
the
indian
jar
olsen
had
tried
to
find
out
if
he
was
ambitious
and
the
girl
in
the
alameda
meant
to
learn
if
he
could
be
moved
by
beauty
well
they
ought
to
know
something
about
him
now
but
they
were
not
very
clever
or
they
would
have
extended
their
experiments
over
a
longer
time
it
looked
as
if
they
thought
him
something
of
a
fool
and
this
was
perhaps
an
advantage
kit
smiled
as
he
remembered
that
when
janet
bell
tried
to
flirt
with
him
he
had
been
rather
humiliated
and
felt
himself
a
prig
he
was
older
now
and
had
not
been
much
embarrassed
in
the
alameda
although
he
nearly
picked
up
the
flower
his
curiosity
was
excited
and
he
wanted
to
find
out
the
girl
object
indeed
it
was
hard
to
see
why
he
had
left
the
flower
alone
but
he
had
a
vague
feeling
that
it
was
unfair
to
use
a
charming
girl
in
a
dark
intrigue
since
he
had
known
grace
osborn
he
had
given
women
a
higher
place
for
her
sake
he
would
not
try
to
gain
an
advantage
against
his
and
the
president
antagonist
by
embarking
on
an
adventure
with
the
spanish
girl
then
he
began
to
wonder
whether
he
would
see
grace
again
but
presently
got
up
with
an
impatient
shrug
grace
in
all
probability
had
forgotten
their
friendship
and
married
thorn
anyhow
she
was
not
for
him
and
it
was
futile
to
indulge
a
barren
sentiment
chapter
iv
the
president
ball
breakfast
was
over
and
alvarez
sitting
at
a
table
in
the
arcade
smiled
as
he
indicated
the
transformed
patio
the
broken
pavement
had
been
swept
the
fountain
scrubbed
until
the
marble
showed
white
veins
and
the
old
brass
rails
of
the
balconies
gleamed
with
yellow
reflections
where
the
sunshine
fell
small
palms
and
flowering
plants
in
tubs
stood
among
the
pillars
flags
hung
from
crumbling
cornices
and
barefooted
peons
were
fastening
up
colored
lamps
when
the
people
are
discontented
they
must
be
amused
the
president
remarked
in
rome
they
gave
them
circuses
and
i
had
thought
of
a
there
is
a
spanish
quadrilla
in
cuba
but
i
found
it
would
cost
too
much
to
bring
the
company
across
besides
i
do
not
know
if
strong
excitement
would
be
good
for
the
citizens
a
ball
is
safer
adam
agreed
while
they
have
the
function
to
talk
about
they
forget
to
plot
for
a
week
perhaps
well
it
ought
to
be
some
help
if
your
agents
are
prompt
they
hustlers
and
know
they
got
to
get
busy
i
expect
the
back
in
fourteen
days
and
then
it
will
be
your
business
to
rush
her
cargo
up
mule
transport
slow
on
your
swamp
tracks
and
perhaps
unfortunate
you
did
give
my
friends
the
concession
for
the
light
railroad
you
might
have
found
it
useful
now
alvarez
shrugged
a
railroad
can
be
cut
and
locomotives
break
down
at
awkward
times
when
their
drivers
are
bribed
then
i
have
granted
so
many
concessions
that
there
is
not
much
that
foreigners
think
worth
getting
left
in
the
country
one
must
keep
something
to
bargain
with
governing
a
people
like
yours
is
an
expensive
job
however
since
they
make
it
expensive
they
ought
to
grumble
if
you
tax
them
high
they
do
not
always
pay
the
taxes
alvarez
rejoined
with
a
twinkle
if
they
run
me
out
they
will
probably
disown
their
debts
and
then
there
will
be
trouble
with
the
foreigners
still
that
is
not
very
important
because
i
shall
be
gone
and
the
americans
will
not
let
the
consuls
use
much
pressure
the
speculators
understand
the
risks
that
so
said
adam
and
added
meaningly
some
of
the
speculators
are
american
alvarez
put
his
hand
on
adam
arm
my
friend
if
it
is
possible
you
will
be
paid
if
not
it
will
be
because
i
am
dead
i
know
said
adam
i
not
scared
to
take
chances
and
when
they
go
against
me
i
do
grumble
anyhow
time
is
important
and
if
you
work
this
ball
properly
it
ought
to
give
us
another
week
you
get
the
money
for
your
soldiers
shortly
afterwards
and
mayne
will
land
your
guns
the
president
dark
face
softened
and
he
smiled
i
know
whom
i
can
trust
he
said
and
went
away
if
it
possible
for
a
to
be
an
honest
man
don
hernando
meets
the
bill
adam
remarked
anyhow
he
a
better
president
than
these
folks
deserve
and
they
be
blamed
fools
if
they
turn
him
down
he
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
then
resumed
i
gave
you
a
share
in
my
business
kit
and
now
if
you
are
willing
i
buy
you
out
but
i
quite
satisfied
i
much
sooner
stick
to
our
agreement
kit
said
with
surprise
well
i
guess
you
rash
your
share
is
large
but
it
would
go
some
way
to
buy
an
english
farm
raising
herdwick
sheep
is
a
pretty
tame
occupation
but
i
reckon
it
safer
than
backing
alvarez
kit
thought
hard
and
imagined
he
saw
adam
object
of
course
he
said
if
you
want
to
get
rid
of
me
i
do
know
that
i
keen
you
some
help
but
you
came
out
to
forget
the
girl
in
england
and
not
to
stay
well
if
you
mean
to
go
now
your
time
the
trouble
is
i
have
forgotten
her
kit
answered
quietly
adam
eyes
twinkled
if
you
go
home
you
may
get
her
and
i
allow
probably
worth
the
effort
but
you
not
going
to
me
like
that
if
you
quit
now
i
can
buy
you
out
and
you
have
something
to
help
you
make
another
start
afterwards
i
may
be
able
you
hesitate
about
taking
the
money
i
guess
you
earned
it
i
suspected
where
you
were
leading
still
you
see
i
sooner
stay
for
one
thing
i
hate
leaving
an
awkward
job
half
finished
you
beginning
to
feel
the
job
is
bigger
than
you
thought
it
was
when
you
undertook
it
it
certainly
is
adam
agreed
however
since
you
insist
i
talk
plain
alvarez
has
no
claim
on
you
although
he
has
a
claim
on
me
and
i
pay
my
debts
the
last
to
fall
due
is
going
to
strain
my
finances
but
it
must
be
paid
a
hundred
cents
for
every
dollar
all
the
same
the
liability
is
not
yours
there
no
reason
why
you
should
pull
out
while
you
safe
kit
shook
his
head
i
see
a
reason
i
do
know
if
it
sound
but
after
all
one
is
worth
something
oh
well
said
adam
we
wo
quarrel
you
very
like
peter
and
the
staunchest
man
i
know
he
got
up
and
when
he
went
off
kit
feeling
somewhat
moved
lighted
a
cigarette
and
smoked
thoughtfully
it
looked
as
if
adam
did
not
think
the
president
would
win
but
for
all
that
meant
to
stand
by
him
although
not
fastidious
about
his
business
methods
adam
had
his
code
and
was
not
afraid
when
friendship
demanded
it
to
fight
for
a
lost
cause
moreover
kit
meant
to
fight
with
him
then
he
got
up
and
smiled
adam
meant
well
but
he
was
clumsy
if
he
had
wanted
to
save
kit
from
sharing
his
risk
he
might
have
made
a
better
plan
when
evening
came
kit
entered
the
arcade
and
sat
down
in
a
quiet
spot
to
look
about
the
moon
was
nearly
full
and
flooded
half
the
patio
with
silver
light
the
rest
was
in
shadow
and
rows
of
colored
lamps
twinkled
in
the
gloom
a
band
played
behind
the
pillars
the
rattle
of
castanets
breaking
in
on
the
tinkle
of
the
guitars
when
the
beat
was
sharply
marked
the
music
was
seductive
unlike
any
kit
had
heard
in
england
and
he
thought
it
tinged
by
the
melancholy
the
moors
had
brought
long
since
from
the
east
to
spain
at
one
end
of
the
patio
groups
of
young
men
and
women
moved
through
the
changing
figures
of
an
old
spanish
dance
their
poses
were
strangely
graceful
and
some
had
a
touch
of
stateliness
this
vanished
when
the
music
changed
and
the
figures
raising
bent
arms
danced
with
riotous
abandon
in
a
minute
or
two
the
melancholy
note
was
struck
again
and
the
movements
were
marked
by
dignified
reserve
kit
got
a
hint
of
southern
passion
and
by
contrast
of
the
austerity
that
often
goes
with
indian
blood
in
the
meantime
he
noted
the
play
of
moving
color
for
the
women
wore
white
and
pink
and
yellow
some
had
flowers
in
their
dark
hair
and
some
covered
their
heads
with
a
lace
mantilla
the
men
clothes
were
varied
for
a
number
wore
shabby
uniforms
and
others
white
linen
with
red
silk
sashes
while
a
few
had
chosen
the
plain
black
and
wide
sombrero
of
the
spanish
don
at
the
other
end
of
the
patio
portly
señoras
with
powdered
faces
sat
among
the
pillars
and
grave
citizens
moved
about
the
pavement
in
talking
groups
a
man
with
a
very
swarthy
color
and
thick
lips
went
to
and
fro
among
them
bowing
and
smiling
and
kit
knew
this
was
galdar
the
president
rival
kit
did
not
like
the
fellow
and
thought
his
negro
strain
was
marked
he
looked
sensual
cruel
and
cunning
for
the
most
part
the
president
stood
outside
the
crowd
although
now
and
then
a
group
formed
about
him
he
was
tall
and
thin
his
face
was
inscrutable
and
kit
thought
he
looked
lonely
and
austere
by
and
by
an
officer
kit
had
met
told
him
he
must
dance
and
took
him
along
the
arcade
the
officer
stopped
where
two
girls
sat
under
a
string
of
lamps
with
a
man
in
black
clothes
and
a
fat
old
woman
behind
at
first
kit
could
not
see
them
well
but
when
they
got
up
he
started
as
he
recognized
the
girl
who
had
dropped
the
flower
then
he
tried
to
hide
his
embarrassment
as
he
was
presented
to
señorita
francisca
sarmiento
she
was
handsomer
than
he
had
thought
and
as
she
made
him
a
stately
curtsey
her
eyes
twinkled
kit
imagined
the
other
girl
studied
him
carefully
and
wondered
whether
she
knew
about
the
flower
it
was
however
his
duty
to
ask
the
señorita
to
dance
and
after
a
few
moments
they
crossed
the
pavement
kit
had
some
misgivings
because
the
dance
was
involved
and
one
used
a
number
of
different
steps
but
the
girl
guided
him
through
its
intricacies
and
when
he
took
her
back
signed
him
to
sit
down
he
obeyed
for
francisca
sarmiento
had
an
imperious
air
other
young
men
came
up
when
the
music
began
again
but
passed
on
and
kit
imagined
the
girl
had
made
them
understand
they
were
to
do
so
since
one
or
two
frowned
at
him
well
she
said
looking
at
him
across
her
fan
how
do
you
like
this
country
it
has
many
attractions
kit
replied
but
some
drawbacks
the
drawbacks
are
not
very
obvious
now
ah
she
said
giving
him
a
mocking
glance
for
an
englishman
you
are
polite
but
it
looks
as
if
you
were
as
cautious
as
i
thought
i
flattered
that
you
thought
about
me
at
all
kit
rejoined
she
laughed
and
played
with
her
fan
oh
well
we
are
curious
about
strangers
particularly
when
they
are
friends
of
the
president
one
wonders
why
they
come
i
imagine
most
of
us
come
to
get
money
in
this
country
one
gets
nothing
unless
one
runs
some
risk
and
you
are
cautious
francisca
remarked
kit
noted
her
insistence
on
this
trait
of
his
he
thought
her
remarks
had
a
meaning
that
did
not
appear
on
the
surface
i
wonder
what
grounds
you
have
for
thinking
so
he
said
are
they
not
obvious
she
answered
not
long
since
you
hesitated
to
pick
up
a
sprig
of
heliotrope
i
durst
not
think
the
compliment
was
meant
for
me
francisca
glanced
at
him
with
quiet
amusement
you
are
modest
señor
it
looks
as
if
you
had
a
number
of
virtues
for
one
thing
i
imagine
you
are
honest
and
honesty
is
not
very
common
here
she
paused
and
resumed
in
a
meaning
tone
it
is
a
drawback
if
one
wants
to
get
rich
i
do
know
that
my
character
is
worth
your
study
kit
replied
carelessly
you
are
of
some
importance
señor
although
i
have
admitted
that
you
are
modest
it
is
strange
you
do
not
know
why
should
i
know
kit
asked
francisca
studied
him
over
her
ebony
fan
which
hid
half
her
face
and
emphasized
the
curious
glow
of
her
black
eyes
i
do
not
think
you
are
as
dull
as
you
pretend
have
you
not
been
experimented
on
recently
i
think
i
have
said
kit
after
all
a
gold
onza
is
not
a
great
temptation
i
found
another
a
spray
of
heliotrope
harder
to
resist
but
you
did
resist
she
replied
in
a
quiet
voice
yes
said
kit
fixing
his
eyes
on
her
face
i
am
an
adventurer
like
the
rest
but
it
is
rather
a
shabby
thing
to
try
to
gain
an
advantage
in
a
battle
with
a
woman
besides
as
i
not
clever
i
might
have
failed
with
a
languid
movement
of
her
head
francisca
looked
round
and
kit
imagined
she
saw
the
others
were
too
far
off
to
hear
then
she
made
him
a
half
mocking
bow
we
need
not
quarrel
señor
and
i
will
give
you
a
hint
since
you
are
incorruptible
this
town
is
not
the
place
for
you
strangers
from
the
north
sometimes
get
fever
and
i
would
not
like
you
to
suffer
because
you
are
honest
and
have
chosen
the
losing
side
ah
said
kit
you
think
our
side
will
lose
francisca
moved
her
fan
as
if
to
indicate
galdar
who
stood
in
the
moonlight
near
the
fountain
he
was
smiling
urbanely
and
a
number
of
men
and
women
had
gathered
about
him
kit
knew
they
were
people
of
importance
at
the
end
of
the
patio
the
president
stood
alone
in
the
advancing
gloom
you
see
she
said
well
i
am
engaged
for
the
next
dance
you
have
my
leave
to
go
kit
left
her
and
sat
down
in
a
quiet
spot
on
the
whole
he
thought
the
president
antagonists
had
been
foolish
when
they
tried
to
use
the
girl
she
was
so
to
speak
too
good
and
perhaps
too
proud
for
the
part
they
expected
her
to
play
this
however
was
not
important
he
imagined
she
had
meant
well
when
she
gave
him
a
hint
although
the
hint
was
not
worth
much
because
kit
thought
adam
saw
how
things
were
going
then
he
reflected
with
some
amusement
that
he
need
not
bother
much
about
deceiving
the
enemy
since
galdar
friends
would
not
suspect
that
buccaneer
askew
had
knowingly
chosen
the
losing
side
presently
kit
joined
adam
who
sat
near
a
lamp
his
face
was
damp
and
looked
pinched
let
go
and
get
a
drink
he
said
i
thirsty
got
a
dose
of
intermittent
fever
again
some
tables
behind
the
pillars
were
laid
out
with
wine
and
fruit
and
adam
beckoned
a
mulatto
waiter
and
bring
some
ice
there
is
no
señor
we
have
sherry
vermouth
and
some
very
good
anisado
you
have
plenty
adam
declared
go
and
look
the
waiter
went
away
and
adam
frowned
i
ca
stand
for
their
scented
liquors
i
want
a
long
cool
drink
after
a
few
minutes
the
waiter
came
back
with
a
large
glass
in
which
a
lump
of
ice
floated
in
red
wine
and
mineral
water
adam
sending
him
away
remarked
that
a
stupid
fellow
i
wanted
to
mix
the
stuff
myself
he
drank
thirstily
and
put
down
the
glass
tastes
bitter
too
much
resin
in
the
wine
or
perhaps
it
imagination
he
lifted
the
glass
but
stopped
and
threw
the
rest
of
the
liquor
on
the
pavement
reckon
i
had
enough
about
the
meanest
drink
i
struck
give
me
a
cigar
the
taste
stops
in
my
mouth
kit
gave
him
a
cigar
but
after
a
few
minutes
he
threw
it
away
i
do
feel
much
better
and
think
i
go
to
my
room
you
might
come
along
the
stairs
are
steep
he
got
up
awkwardly
and
leaned
upon
the
table
breathing
rather
hard
while
big
drops
of
sweat
started
from
his
forehead
this
confounded
ague
grips
me
tight
do
know
when
i
felt
so
shaky
better
give
me
your
arm
they
started
and
keeping
in
the
shadow
reached
the
outside
stairs
without
exciting
much
curiosity
but
kit
felt
disturbed
adam
went
up
slowly
stopping
now
and
then
and
stumbled
across
the
balcony
at
the
top
bright
moonlight
shone
into
the
bare
room
where
a
small
lamp
burned
and
kit
saw
that
adam
face
was
wet
leave
me
alone
he
said
you
can
come
back
by
and
by
and
see
how
getting
on
kit
did
not
want
to
go
but
gave
way
when
adam
insisted
he
met
the
president
soon
afterwards
where
is
don
adam
the
latter
asked
kit
told
him
and
added
that
his
uncle
had
seemed
to
get
worse
after
drinking
some
wine
ah
said
alvarez
thoughtfully
fresh
is
better
when
one
is
feverish
did
he
drink
anything
else
no
said
kit
the
waiter
wanted
to
bring
some
anisado
but
he
insisted
on
the
wine
alvarez
took
him
to
the
table
where
the
refreshments
were
served
and
clapped
his
hands
a
waiter
came
up
but
kit
said
that
is
not
the
boy
where
are
your
companions
the
president
asked
one
is
washing
the
glasses
señor
i
do
not
know
where
the
other
has
gone
alvarez
opened
a
door
and
kit
saw
a
man
putting
small
into
a
pail
it
was
another
fellow
who
brought
the
wine
he
said
and
alvarez
beckoned
the
waiter
call
the
a
man
dressed
in
plain
black
clothes
came
in
and
alvarez
asked
how
many
of
these
fellows
did
you
send
to
serve
the
wine
two
señor
it
was
enough
three
came
it
will
be
your
business
to
find
the
third
said
the
president
sternly
and
turned
to
kit
what
was
the
fellow
like
kit
described
the
waiter
and
alvarez
said
to
the
you
will
be
held
accountable
if
the
man
has
got
away
send
doctor
martin
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
the
went
away
and
alvarez
knitted
his
brows
galdar
friends
are
bold
but
i
had
not
expected
this
however
don
adam
drinking
wine
may
have
balked
them
and
martin
is
a
good
doctor
kit
asked
no
questions
for
he
could
trust
the
president
and
thought
there
was
no
time
to
lose
they
crossed
the
patio
and
found
a
man
waiting
in
the
shadow
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
alvarez
said
a
word
or
two
and
they
went
up
when
they
entered
the
room
adam
glanced
up
from
the
bed
i
see
you
have
brought
the
doctor
he
said
with
an
effort
in
this
country
one
takes
precautions
alvarez
replied
you
look
ill
my
friend
i
have
looked
worse
if
i
drunk
anisado
adam
remarked
anyhow
you
had
better
light
out
and
let
señor
martin
get
to
work
the
doctor
who
felt
adam
pulse
made
a
sign
of
agreement
and
then
writing
on
a
leaf
of
his
pocketbook
gave
it
to
the
president
will
you
send
that
to
my
house
i
need
the
things
at
once
alvarez
moved
away
and
adam
looked
at
kit
with
a
forced
smile
you
need
be
anxious
partner
i
did
drink
all
the
wine
reckon
they
have
got
me
yet
then
they
went
out
and
left
adam
with
the
doctor
chapter
v
olsen
offer
for
a
time
kit
wandered
about
the
arcade
talking
now
and
then
to
people
he
knew
the
doctor
had
forbidden
him
to
return
to
adam
room
and
the
president
said
it
was
important
the
guests
should
not
know
that
anything
unusual
had
happened
although
kit
watched
the
stairs
anxiously
nobody
came
down
but
he
saw
the
going
quietly
about
and
servants
came
and
went
on
mysterious
errands
when
he
looked
out
he
found
the
sentries
had
been
doubled
on
the
terrace
and
one
stopped
when
for
a
few
moments
kit
left
the
arch
but
the
soldier
knew
him
and
marched
on
while
it
was
obvious
that
the
waiter
was
being
looked
for
kit
thought
the
search
had
begun
too
late
at
length
alvarez
sent
for
him
and
although
his
heart
beat
as
he
followed
the
messenger
he
felt
some
relief
when
he
saw
the
president
i
have
good
news
the
latter
said
the
doctor
is
no
longer
anxious
and
you
may
see
your
uncle
in
the
morning
it
looks
as
if
don
adam
caution
saved
him
you
mean
when
he
refused
the
anisado
alvarez
nodded
it
is
a
liquor
and
one
drinks
a
small
quantity
taking
water
afterwards
if
one
wants
don
adam
knows
the
country
and
after
all
my
enemies
have
not
much
imagination
to
offer
him
anisado
was
a
rather
obvious
trick
i
thankful
they
failed
kit
said
sternly
and
clenched
his
fist
with
sudden
passion
if
they
had
not
one
understands
don
cristoval
i
have
felt
like
that
when
the
plotters
did
not
fail
alvarez
answered
with
grim
sympathy
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
and
kit
imagined
he
was
thinking
about
his
murdered
son
then
he
resumed
well
we
shall
have
a
reckoning
and
it
will
be
bad
for
the
dogs
when
i
send
in
my
bill
but
that
must
wait
and
i
would
like
you
to
dance
i
see
señorita
sarmiento
is
not
engaged
and
she
dances
well
i
doubt
if
dona
francisca
would
care
to
dance
with
me
again
ah
said
alvarez
one
should
not
be
too
modest
francisca
is
a
politician
but
she
is
a
woman
perhaps
you
found
she
is
not
on
my
side
i
imagined
she
was
not
alvarez
shrugged
well
i
do
not
fight
with
women
although
they
are
sometimes
dangerous
try
again
my
friend
just
now
we
are
all
playing
at
kit
obeyed
and
found
francisca
gracious
she
danced
with
him
and
afterwards
allowed
him
to
sit
by
her
by
and
by
she
remarked
i
have
not
seen
señor
askew
for
some
time
he
was
not
very
well
said
kit
francisca
studied
his
face
i
hope
his
illness
is
not
serious
i
thought
i
saw
doctor
martin
fever
my
uncle
gets
it
now
and
then
i
think
i
warned
you
against
our
fevers
francisca
replied
meaningly
there
are
two
or
three
kinds
but
all
are
not
dangerous
some
are
kit
suggested
yes
to
foreigners
we
others
take
precautions
and
are
acclimatized
well
said
kit
in
a
thoughtful
voice
i
have
not
had
fever
yet
but
i
suppose
an
unacclimatized
adventurer
runs
some
risk
francisca
played
with
her
fan
and
kit
imagined
she
was
pondering
a
risk
that
leads
to
nothing
is
not
worth
while
she
remarked
i
think
it
would
be
prudent
if
you
left
the
country
while
you
are
well
i
should
be
sorry
if
i
thought
you
wanted
me
to
go
said
kit
that
is
cheap
señor
i
gave
you
good
advice
oh
well
said
kit
i
really
think
you
did
there
are
matters
about
which
we
do
not
agree
but
i
believe
you
are
too
kind
to
let
a
rather
ignorant
antagonist
get
hurt
franciscans
eyes
twinkled
as
she
rejoined
i
like
the
compliment
better
than
the
other
but
i
am
engaged
for
the
next
dance
and
as
you
are
intelligent
there
is
not
much
more
to
be
said
kit
went
away
thinking
rather
hard
the
girl
had
some
part
in
the
intrigue
against
the
president
and
it
would
obviously
be
an
advantage
to
her
friends
if
he
could
be
persuaded
to
leave
the
country
now
adam
was
ill
admitting
this
he
thought
her
warning
sincere
on
the
whole
he
liked
francisca
sarmiento
and
believed
she
did
not
want
him
to
be
hurt
if
adam
did
not
get
much
better
and
he
had
to
look
after
things
he
would
certainly
run
some
risk
of
a
cunning
attack
by
the
president
enemies
when
the
guests
began
to
leave
kit
went
to
his
room
and
after
some
hours
of
broken
sleep
was
told
that
adam
wanted
him
he
found
alvarez
in
the
room
and
adam
lying
with
a
flushed
face
and
wet
forehead
in
a
big
cane
chair
when
kit
came
in
adam
gave
him
a
friendly
smile
and
turned
to
alvarez
if
i
taken
that
drink
at
a
wineshop
i
have
deserved
all
i
got
he
said
i
allowed
i
was
safe
at
the
presidio
it
is
a
stain
on
my
hospitality
for
which
somebody
shall
pay
that
all
right
said
adam
you
not
accountable
looks
as
if
the
other
fellow
was
too
smart
for
both
of
us
but
i
had
a
feeling
i
better
stick
to
and
you
can
generally
taste
anything
suspicious
in
that
mixture
and
i
been
doped
before
but
as
i
an
american
citizen
and
american
influence
is
powerful
i
did
expect
they
be
bold
enough
to
get
after
me
alvarez
smiled
our
climate
is
unhealthy
but
if
you
had
died
and
suspicion
was
excited
your
countrymen
would
have
made
the
president
responsible
that
would
have
been
another
embarrassment
and
i
have
enough
galdar
friends
are
a
cunning
lot
adam
replied
well
i
think
your
doctor
has
fixed
me
up
for
a
time
what
about
your
plans
i
had
some
talk
with
my
supporters
last
night
and
we
agreed
to
strike
when
the
cargo
arrives
we
need
the
guns
and
money
to
pay
my
troops
and
when
we
get
them
we
will
arrest
the
leading
conspirators
this
will
start
the
revolution
but
it
will
fail
if
my
blow
is
struck
before
galdar
is
ready
yes
said
adam
we
can
trust
mayne
he
knows
he
got
to
hustle
fixed
it
for
him
to
get
the
spanish
money
at
havana
and
that
will
mean
losing
a
day
or
two
but
the
old
can
hit
up
a
pretty
good
pace
and
mayne
wo
spare
his
coal
i
reckon
we
hear
from
him
soon
adam
stopped
and
kit
seeing
that
it
cost
him
an
effort
to
talk
took
the
president
away
they
met
the
doctor
on
the
stairs
and
kit
waited
at
the
bottom
until
he
came
down
señor
martin
was
a
fat
spanish
creole
your
uncle
is
an
obstinate
man
and
will
not
take
a
hint
he
remarked
i
had
some
trouble
to
save
him
and
he
may
not
escape
next
time
then
you
imagine
there
will
be
another
time
señor
martin
shrugged
expressively
i
am
a
doctor
not
a
politician
but
in
this
country
much
depends
upon
the
risk
of
being
found
out
señor
askew
is
old
and
not
strong
one
must
pay
for
leading
a
strenuous
life
and
he
has
had
malaria
for
some
years
he
ought
to
remain
in
the
north
it
is
your
business
to
persuade
him
but
do
not
disturb
him
yet
i
will
try
kit
said
doubtfully
you
think
it
needful
if
he
does
not
go
soon
he
will
not
go
at
all
the
doctor
replied
in
a
meaning
tone
he
went
away
and
some
time
afterwards
kit
returned
to
his
uncle
room
the
shutters
were
pushed
back
from
the
balcony
window
and
the
strong
light
reflected
by
the
white
wall
showed
the
thinness
of
adam
figure
and
the
deep
lines
on
his
face
his
skin
was
a
curious
yellow
color
and
his
eyes
were
dull
you
have
been
well
for
some
time
and
the
stuff
you
got
last
night
has
shaken
you
rather
badly
kit
remarked
with
a
touch
of
embarrassment
i
think
you
ought
to
go
back
with
mayne
you
imagine
you
can
manage
things
better
without
me
adam
rejoined
no
said
kit
coloring
it
a
big
and
awkward
job
but
perhaps
i
can
manage
i
feel
you
ought
to
go
it
looks
as
if
the
doctor
had
put
you
on
my
track
he
been
arguing
with
me
what
did
he
say
kit
hesitated
and
adam
smiled
i
can
guess
partner
and
perhaps
he
was
right
well
i
getting
old
and
have
a
notion
i
wo
live
long
anyway
do
see
that
it
matters
much
if
i
go
or
stay
and
i
a
reason
for
staying
you
do
know
yet
besides
i
hate
to
be
beaten
and
mean
to
put
over
my
last
job
he
paused
and
gave
kit
a
steady
look
there
one
drawback
putting
it
over
may
cost
you
something
that
does
count
kit
said
quietly
what
you
have
is
yours
i
expect
you
earned
it
hard
i
certainly
did
adam
agreed
i
earned
part
of
what
i
got
by
jobs
that
cost
me
more
than
my
health
i
wipe
out
some
of
my
early
deals
if
i
could
well
i
do
know
if
playing
a
straight
game
on
a
losing
hand
will
cancel
past
mistakes
but
i
feel
i
got
to
play
it
out
my
wad
and
yours
are
in
the
pool
it
not
my
wad
kit
objected
you
have
treated
me
generously
oh
well
said
adam
perhaps
i
ask
you
to
remember
that
by
and
by
in
the
meantime
i
no
use
for
arguing
and
am
going
to
stop
we
say
no
more
about
it
but
if
i
too
sick
to
handle
things
you
take
control
you
know
my
plans
and
that
enough
i
do
need
your
promises
that
you
wo
let
me
down
now
you
can
get
out
i
going
to
sleep
kit
went
away
feeling
moved
but
anxious
his
uncle
trusted
him
and
he
had
got
strangely
fond
of
the
buccaneer
adam
had
his
faults
and
his
career
had
been
marked
by
incidents
that
were
hard
to
justify
but
he
was
staunch
to
his
friends
kit
did
not
know
how
far
alvarez
deserved
his
staunch
support
and
suspected
that
adam
was
to
some
extent
moved
by
pride
he
meant
to
make
good
before
he
let
things
go
kit
resolved
that
when
the
old
man
hands
lost
the
grip
he
would
take
firm
hold
next
day
adam
was
obviously
worse
and
when
two
or
three
more
had
passed
the
doctor
looked
anxious
then
one
hot
evening
the
president
brought
kit
a
letter
addressed
to
his
uncle
don
adam
is
asleep
and
must
not
be
disturbed
he
said
perhaps
you
had
better
read
this
it
may
be
about
the
kit
opened
the
envelope
and
frowned
the
letter
was
from
mayne
who
stated
that
he
had
met
bad
weather
soon
after
leaving
port
and
the
racing
of
the
engines
in
a
heavy
sea
had
caused
some
damage
he
had
however
reached
havana
where
he
had
received
the
spanish
money
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
some
time
would
be
required
to
repair
the
damage
but
it
would
be
risky
to
resume
the
voyage
with
disabled
engines
kit
gave
the
letter
to
the
president
whose
dark
face
flushed
and
for
a
few
moments
he
stormed
with
spanish
fury
this
dog
of
a
sailor
has
been
bought
he
cried
clenching
his
hands
as
he
walked
about
the
floor
if
the
money
does
not
arrive
soon
it
will
be
too
late
my
soldiers
will
not
take
our
notes
galdar
has
paid
him
to
ruin
me
kit
knowing
the
emotional
character
of
the
let
him
rage
alvarez
did
not
often
lose
his
and
he
had
some
grounds
for
feeling
disturbed
when
he
stopped
kit
said
quietly
the
captain
is
honest
but
if
he
loses
his
ship
with
the
guns
and
money
on
board
it
will
not
help
us
much
if
my
uncle
is
better
in
the
morning
i
will
see
what
he
thinks
if
not
i
will
decide
about
the
orders
to
send
when
alvarez
left
him
he
went
into
the
town
and
after
walking
about
the
alameda
sat
down
at
a
table
in
front
of
the
café
and
ordered
some
wine
this
was
safer
than
the
black
coffee
and
scented
cordials
the
citizens
drank
but
he
tasted
it
carefully
and
gave
himself
up
to
anxious
thought
without
draining
his
glass
the
insurance
on
the
did
not
cover
all
the
risks
mayne
would
run
if
he
left
port
with
disabled
engines
and
the
coast
was
dangerous
the
loss
of
the
ship
would
be
a
blow
but
if
mayne
did
not
leave
havana
soon
the
freight
might
arrive
after
the
president
fall
kit
feeling
his
responsibility
shrank
from
the
momentous
choice
and
while
he
pondered
olsen
came
up
and
occupied
a
chair
opposite
drinking
he
remarked
well
i
guess
that
prudent
but
the
buccaneer
he
been
looking
shaky
and
i
heard
he
was
kit
wondered
how
much
olsen
knew
he
said
adam
fever
came
and
went
and
he
would
no
doubt
be
better
soon
olsen
smiled
and
shook
his
head
there
no
use
in
giving
me
that
stuff
i
know
the
climate
going
under
fast
and
will
never
be
fit
again
i
reckon
the
old
man
knows
he
got
to
let
up
if
you
do
what
are
you
going
to
do
when
he
pulls
out
it
will
need
some
thought
kit
answered
cautiously
since
he
had
grounds
for
believing
the
other
imagined
he
was
adam
clerk
olsen
ordered
some
vermouth
and
then
remarked
in
a
meaning
tone
i
do
have
to
be
careful
about
my
drinks
there
an
advantage
in
taking
the
popular
side
are
you
sure
yours
is
the
popular
side
wait
and
see
olsen
rejoined
though
that
plan
expensive
because
it
may
be
too
late
when
you
find
out
my
employers
do
often
back
the
wrong
man
and
i
trust
their
judgment
now
if
you
listen
show
you
kit
signed
him
to
go
on
and
olsen
resumed
the
buccaneer
will
drop
out
soon
and
you
be
left
to
do
the
best
you
can
for
yourself
well
i
do
suppose
you
get
another
chance
like
this
we
pay
you
ten
thousand
dollars
if
you
can
keep
the
back
for
a
week
that
does
indicate
that
you
sure
of
winning
kit
remarked
dryly
besides
i
would
trust
galdar
to
put
up
the
money
i
do
ask
you
to
trust
galdar
my
people
will
find
the
money
in
a
sense
it
does
matter
to
us
who
is
president
except
that
we
want
the
concessions
galdar
promised
and
they
worth
an
extra
two
thousand
pounds
we
give
you
american
bills
for
the
sum
if
your
steamer
lands
her
cargo
too
late
to
be
of
use
kit
thought
hard
it
looked
as
if
olsen
knew
the
had
broken
down
if
so
he
was
obviously
well
informed
and
his
employers
were
persuaded
that
the
probability
of
the
president
downfall
was
strong
enough
to
justify
the
bribe
two
thousand
pounds
would
go
some
way
to
making
ashness
a
model
farm
while
it
was
plain
that
adam
might
lose
the
money
he
had
hinted
he
meant
to
leave
kit
kit
however
did
not
feel
tempted
although
he
wanted
to
find
out
something
about
olsen
plans
you
seem
to
take
my
agreement
for
granted
he
remarked
you
must
see
that
i
could
embarrass
you
by
telling
alvarez
olsen
laughed
you
could
put
him
wise
but
you
could
embarrass
us
the
president
knows
whom
he
up
against
the
trouble
is
he
is
strong
enough
to
get
after
us
well
suppose
i
refuse
you
be
a
blame
fool
that
all
there
is
to
it
kit
doubted
he
knew
what
had
happened
to
adam
and
in
spite
of
statement
imagined
galdar
friends
would
not
let
him
warn
the
president
anyhow
you
must
give
me
until
the
morning
i
want
to
think
about
it
he
said
in
order
to
test
his
suspicions
we
ca
wait
the
thing
must
be
put
over
now
there
no
use
in
trying
to
raise
my
offer
you
know
our
limit
oh
well
said
kit
i
afraid
i
have
to
let
it
go
there
are
difficulties
and
if
you
ca
wait
olsen
looked
at
him
with
surprise
and
kit
saw
he
had
not
expected
his
offer
to
be
refused
the
fellow
had
a
cynical
distrust
of
human
nature
that
had
persuaded
him
kit
could
not
resist
the
temptation
his
shallow
cleverness
sometimes
misled
him
and
had
done
so
when
he
took
it
for
granted
that
kit
was
adam
clerk
you
do
mean
you
going
to
turn
my
offer
down
olsen
said
sharply
you
force
me
i
ca
decide
just
yet
olsen
hesitated
knitting
his
brows
oh
he
exclaimed
ridiculous
the
thing
will
cost
you
nothing
and
i
come
up
a
thousand
dollars
you
ought
to
see
you
must
accept
i
do
see
kit
replied
as
carelessly
as
he
could
and
got
up
since
you
ca
wait
i
understand
the
matter
off
he
went
away
and
glancing
back
as
he
crossed
the
street
saw
that
olsen
pose
was
curiously
fixed
and
he
seemed
to
be
gazing
straight
in
front
some
of
the
customers
now
left
the
café
and
kit
lost
sight
of
him
the
moon
was
high
and
clear
but
the
black
shadows
of
the
trees
fell
upon
the
walk
through
the
alameda
and
there
were
not
many
people
about
kit
would
sooner
not
have
crossed
the
alameda
although
this
was
his
nearest
way
but
thought
he
had
better
do
so
olsen
might
be
watching
and
kit
did
not
want
the
fellow
to
imagine
he
was
afraid
since
it
would
indicate
that
he
knew
the
importance
of
his
refusal
yet
he
was
afraid
and
it
cost
him
something
of
an
effort
to
plunge
into
the
gloom
chapter
vi
the
president
watchers
when
kit
was
half
way
across
the
alameda
he
stopped
and
looked
about
dark
trees
rose
against
the
sky
he
could
smell
the
eucalyptus
and
their
thin
shadows
covered
the
ground
with
a
quivering
open
pattern
there
was
a
pool
of
moonlight
and
farther
on
the
solid
reflections
of
palms
nobody
was
near
him
although
he
heard
voices
across
the
alameda
and
he
stood
for
a
few
moments
thinking
while
his
heart
beat
since
he
had
refused
olsen
offer
caution
was
advisable
because
kit
felt
sure
the
fellow
had
expected
him
to
agree
and
it
was
obvious
that
he
knew
enough
to
make
him
dangerous
he
distrusted
olsen
who
was
not
a
native
american
and
probably
not
a
norwegian
as
he
pretended
there
was
a
mystery
about
his
employers
but
kit
suspected
that
they
were
germans
and
as
a
rule
the
latters
commercial
intrigues
were
marked
by
an
unscrupulous
cunning
of
which
few
of
their
rivals
seemed
capable
this
was
admitting
much
since
the
foreign
adventurers
did
not
claim
high
principles
on
the
surface
it
was
obviously
prudent
to
take
the
shortest
line
to
the
presidio
but
kit
reflected
that
olsen
would
expect
him
to
do
so
it
might
be
better
to
put
him
off
the
track
by
going
another
way
and
kit
was
anxious
to
know
if
he
had
left
the
café
stepping
back
into
the
shadow
he
made
for
another
path
and
a
few
minutes
afterwards
returned
to
the
street
he
glanced
at
the
café
as
he
walked
past
and
saw
that
olsen
was
not
there
he
thought
this
ominous
since
it
indicated
that
the
fellow
had
gone
to
consult
his
revolutionary
friends
and
kit
imagined
they
would
try
to
prevent
his
reaching
the
presidio
he
seldom
carried
a
pistol
which
was
difficult
to
hide
when
one
wore
thin
white
clothes
on
the
whole
he
had
found
a
suspicious
bulge
in
one
pocket
rather
apt
to
provoke
than
to
save
one
from
attack
but
he
was
sorry
he
had
not
a
pistol
now
kit
went
back
across
the
alameda
hoping
he
had
put
olsen
friends
off
the
track
if
so
he
would
be
safe
until
he
got
near
the
presidio
when
he
must
be
cautious
he
passed
two
or
three
groups
of
people
and
now
and
then
heard
steps
behind
but
the
steps
were
followed
by
voices
that
relieved
his
anxiety
for
all
that
he
was
glad
to
leave
the
alameda
and
turn
up
a
street
the
street
was
narrow
hot
and
dirty
there
was
a
smell
of
decaying
rubbish
and
the
rancid
oil
used
in
cooking
one
side
was
in
shadow
and
almost
unbroken
walls
rose
from
the
rough
pavement
for
the
most
part
the
outside
windows
were
narrow
slits
since
the
houses
got
light
from
the
central
patio
here
and
there
an
marked
a
corner
but
that
was
all
and
kit
kept
in
the
moonlight
and
looked
about
keenly
when
he
passed
a
shadowy
door
perspiration
trickled
down
his
face
and
he
felt
an
unpleasant
nervous
tension
yet
nobody
came
near
him
and
when
he
cautiously
glanced
round
nobody
was
lurking
in
the
gloom
he
began
to
think
he
had
cheated
olsen
but
admitted
that
it
was
too
soon
to
slacken
his
watchfulness
at
one
corner
he
saw
two
figures
in
shabby
white
uniform
and
hesitated
in
countries
the
government
generally
maintains
a
force
of
carefully
picked
men
entrusted
with
powers
that
are
seldom
given
to
ordinary
police
they
patrol
in
couples
carry
arms
and
are
sometimes
called
and
sometimes
kit
knew
he
could
trust
the
men
but
doubted
if
they
could
leave
their
post
besides
he
did
not
want
olsen
to
know
he
thought
it
needful
to
ask
for
protection
now
he
came
to
think
of
it
he
had
seen
the
outside
the
café
and
at
another
corner
perhaps
this
was
why
he
had
been
left
alone
he
went
on
rather
reluctantly
and
by
and
by
reached
the
broad
square
in
front
of
the
presidio
the
old
building
was
clear
in
the
moonlight
kit
could
see
a
sentry
on
the
terrace
and
a
faint
glow
in
the
slit
in
the
wall
that
marked
adam
room
it
was
hardly
yards
off
and
he
would
be
safe
before
he
reached
the
arch
but
a
grove
of
small
palms
and
shrubs
ran
between
him
and
the
square
there
were
rails
behind
the
trees
and
the
nearest
opening
was
some
distance
off
a
high
blank
wall
threw
a
dark
shadow
that
stretched
across
the
road
by
the
rails
and
met
the
gloom
of
the
trees
kit
looked
about
without
stopping
or
turning
his
head
much
there
was
nobody
in
sight
but
he
somehow
felt
that
he
was
not
alone
it
was
a
disturbing
and
apparently
an
illogical
feeling
that
he
must
not
indulge
and
pulling
himself
together
he
went
on
with
his
fist
clenched
he
was
not
far
from
the
gate
and
although
he
listened
hard
could
only
hear
his
own
steps
and
voices
in
a
neighboring
street
yet
his
nerves
tingled
and
his
muscles
got
tense
in
front
a
thick
dark
mass
that
looked
like
a
clump
of
euphorbia
or
cactus
stood
beside
the
path
and
just
beyond
it
a
bright
beam
of
moonlight
shone
between
the
drooping
branches
of
the
palms
he
thought
the
spot
the
beam
touched
was
dangerous
as
he
crossed
it
his
figure
would
be
strongly
illuminated
and
he
would
have
his
back
to
the
dark
bush
he
wanted
to
move
aside
and
go
round
the
bush
but
this
might
give
somebody
time
to
spring
out
and
get
between
him
and
the
gate
the
gate
was
close
by
and
he
was
strangely
anxious
to
reach
it
for
all
that
he
was
not
going
to
indulge
his
imagination
he
plunged
into
the
gloom
without
deviating
from
his
path
and
conquered
a
nervous
impulse
that
urged
him
to
run
when
he
had
nearly
passed
the
bush
he
thought
he
heard
a
movement
and
a
thick
stalk
of
the
cactus
shook
half
instinctively
kit
leaped
forward
and
felt
something
soft
brush
against
his
shoulder
as
he
swung
round
in
the
moonlight
with
his
mouth
set
and
his
hand
drawn
back
to
strike
he
saw
a
blanket
on
the
ground
there
was
nothing
else
and
he
breathed
hard
as
he
searched
the
gloom
the
blanket
had
not
been
there
before
next
moment
a
dark
figure
sprang
from
the
shadow
and
a
knife
flashed
in
the
moonlight
then
he
heard
a
heavy
report
and
a
puff
of
smoke
blew
past
his
head
the
figure
swerved
and
staggering
awkwardly
fell
with
a
heavy
thud
it
did
not
move
afterwards
and
while
kit
gazed
at
it
dully
a
man
in
white
uniform
ran
past
and
stooped
beside
the
fellow
on
the
ground
kit
vacantly
noted
that
a
little
smoke
curled
from
the
muzzle
of
his
pistol
one
cartridge
is
enough
he
said
coolly
your
worship
did
not
escape
by
much
another
came
out
of
the
bushes
and
when
they
turned
over
the
body
kit
saw
a
dark
face
and
a
long
thin
knife
clenched
in
a
brown
hand
he
understood
now
that
the
blanket
had
been
meant
to
entangle
his
arm
or
head
peons
often
carry
a
blanket
of
good
quality
on
their
shoulder
it
is
gil
ortega
the
remarked
a
good
shot
that
will
save
us
some
trouble
comrade
how
did
you
come
here
when
you
were
wanted
kit
asked
as
calmly
as
he
could
the
smiled
by
the
president
order
señor
we
were
watching
the
café
but
it
looks
as
if
you
had
got
in
front
of
me
it
is
so
señor
we
thought
it
best
to
follow
this
fellow
he
lost
you
when
you
turned
back
kit
nodded
for
he
remembered
that
he
had
instinctively
avoided
one
or
two
dark
lanes
that
would
have
given
him
a
shorter
line
than
the
streets
ortega
and
the
had
taken
the
shorter
way
he
thought
it
curious
the
report
had
not
drawn
a
crowd
but
although
he
heard
voices
nobody
came
near
and
he
imagined
the
citizens
were
used
to
pistol
shots
giving
the
some
money
he
crossed
the
square
to
the
presidio
and
going
to
his
room
lighted
a
cigarette
he
thought
a
smoke
might
be
soothing
for
he
had
got
a
jar
after
a
time
he
went
to
look
for
alvarez
and
found
him
sitting
in
front
of
a
table
in
the
patio
a
soldier
stood
not
far
off
but
the
president
was
alone
and
the
light
of
a
shaded
lamp
fell
upon
a
bundle
of
letters
and
documents
alvarez
worked
hard
and
had
inherited
a
rather
austere
simplicity
from
his
indian
ancestors
kit
thought
his
plain
white
clothes
and
quiet
calm
gave
him
dignity
it
looks
as
if
my
enemies
meant
to
lose
no
time
he
said
in
english
when
kit
told
him
about
his
adventure
it
their
third
try
in
a
few
weeks
kit
agreed
do
you
find
the
uncertainty
about
where
they
strike
next
rather
wearing
alvarez
shrugged
one
gets
used
to
these
affairs
a
custom
of
the
country
and
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
it
if
the
plot
succeeds
it
is
an
easy
way
of
turning
out
a
president
and
changing
the
government
perhaps
it
is
better
to
kill
a
man
or
two
than
fight
round
barricades
and
burn
the
town
in
the
north
we
find
it
possible
to
change
our
government
by
vote
you
are
people
and
do
understand
the
passions
of
the
south
alvarez
rejoined
with
cynical
humor
we
have
tried
your
plan
but
one
must
be
rich
to
buy
the
votes
besides
if
one
is
beaten
at
the
polls
there
remains
the
last
appeal
to
the
knife
but
you
will
let
this
go
we
have
something
else
to
talk
about
that
is
so
said
kit
to
begin
with
i
must
thank
you
for
sending
your
to
look
after
me
it
is
nothing
alvarez
replied
in
a
deprecatory
tone
you
are
my
guest
and
we
try
to
take
care
of
foreigners
because
if
they
meet
with
accidents
their
consuls
ask
embarrassing
questions
besides
watching
them
serves
two
objects
then
i
expect
you
know
i
met
olsen
at
the
café
kit
suggested
dryly
alvarez
smiled
yes
i
know
but
i
was
not
suspicious
after
all
one
does
generally
conspire
in
a
public
place
in
fact
i
do
understand
why
olsen
met
me
there
he
may
have
meant
to
compromise
you
to
put
doubts
in
my
mind
it
possible
now
i
think
of
it
kit
assented
i
hope
he
succeed
i
know
my
friends
don
cristoval
but
what
did
the
fellow
want
i
do
not
know
all
your
spies
are
pretty
smart
but
i
expect
our
colloquial
english
puzzled
them
kit
remarked
smiling
however
i
was
going
to
tell
you
he
narrated
what
olsen
had
said
and
alvarez
looked
thoughtful
galdar
must
be
nearly
ready
he
has
been
quicker
than
i
imagined
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
the
steamer
i
wait
until
tomorrow
if
my
uncle
is
well
enough
he
must
decide
but
if
he
is
no
better
alvarez
asked
kit
gave
him
a
level
glance
then
i
will
send
mayne
orders
to
run
all
risks
and
start
whether
his
engines
are
repaired
or
not
ah
said
alvarez
with
a
bow
olsen
was
foolish
when
he
tried
to
bribe
you
i
suppose
this
is
your
answer
well
it
is
lucky
that
a
fast
schooner
sails
to
a
port
from
which
a
telegram
can
be
sent
when
your
orders
are
ready
i
will
see
that
they
go
next
morning
kit
found
adam
lying
half
awake
after
a
night
of
delirium
the
old
man
eyes
were
heavy
his
brain
was
dull
and
the
doctor
who
came
in
made
kit
a
sign
not
to
disturb
him
kit
went
out
and
spent
some
time
writing
a
message
to
mayne
it
was
necessary
that
the
captain
should
know
what
he
must
do
but
kit
was
anxious
to
give
no
hint
about
the
importance
of
speed
that
others
would
understand
he
meant
to
guard
against
his
orders
being
read
by
spies
in
olsen
pay
when
he
had
sealed
the
envelope
and
addressed
it
as
the
president
had
told
him
he
went
down
to
the
patio
and
found
a
peon
talking
to
a
guard
this
man
is
the
mate
of
the
catalina
and
wants
to
see
you
said
the
guard
and
when
he
went
off
kit
turned
to
the
other
who
looked
like
a
sailor
my
wife
lives
in
the
town
and
i
have
been
at
home
for
a
day
or
two
said
the
man
i
am
going
back
to
the
schooner
now
and
was
told
you
had
a
letter
for
the
patron
kit
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
although
he
had
expected
the
would
come
for
the
message
there
was
not
much
formality
at
the
presidio
and
the
fellow
was
obviously
a
sailor
yet
kit
hesitated
and
as
he
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
envelope
thought
the
other
eyelids
flickered
the
flicker
was
almost
too
slight
to
notice
but
it
hinted
at
nervousness
and
kit
dropped
the
message
back
very
well
he
said
wait
a
few
minutes
he
went
along
the
arcade
and
stopping
near
the
end
looked
back
the
sailor
had
sat
down
on
a
bench
and
was
lighting
a
cigarette
this
looked
as
if
he
did
not
mind
waiting
and
kit
wondered
whether
it
was
worth
while
to
disturb
the
president
who
was
occupied
he
went
on
however
and
alvarez
signed
him
to
sit
down
when
he
entered
his
room
after
a
minute
or
two
he
put
down
the
document
he
was
reading
to
his
secretary
well
he
said
have
you
written
your
message
for
captain
mayne
it
is
here
the
mate
is
waiting
alvarez
turned
to
the
secretary
my
order
was
that
the
should
come
that
is
so
señor
i
sent
him
word
the
man
told
me
his
wife
lived
in
the
town
and
he
was
starting
back
kit
interposed
the
has
a
house
here
alvarez
replied
we
will
see
the
man
but
first
send
an
order
to
the
guard
to
let
nobody
go
out
he
waited
for
a
minute
after
the
secretary
went
off
and
then
beckoned
kit
who
followed
him
downstairs
and
into
the
arcade
when
they
reached
it
kit
stopped
and
alvarez
turned
to
him
with
a
meaning
smile
there
was
nobody
on
the
bench
it
looks
as
if
my
order
was
sent
too
late
alvarez
remarked
you
had
better
tell
me
exactly
what
happened
kit
complied
and
alvarez
sent
for
the
guard
and
asked
how
did
you
know
the
sailor
was
the
mate
he
told
me
he
was
señor
afterwards
when
don
cristoval
did
not
come
back
he
said
it
was
not
important
and
he
would
not
wait
alvarez
dismissed
the
man
and
shrugged
as
he
turned
to
kit
the
plotters
are
clever
but
they
made
a
mistake
the
fellow
was
too
modest
he
ought
to
have
said
he
was
the
well
we
must
try
to
find
him
although
i
expect
we
are
late
now
give
me
the
message
for
captain
mayne
it
looks
as
if
our
antagonists
knew
its
importance
kit
gave
him
the
envelope
and
went
back
to
adam
room
chapter
vii
adam
resumes
control
although
the
shutters
on
the
balcony
window
were
open
no
draught
entered
the
small
bare
room
and
the
heat
that
soaked
through
the
thick
walls
was
nearly
intolerable
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
presidio
and
a
drowsy
quietness
brooded
over
the
dazzling
town
it
was
two
in
the
afternoon
and
the
citizens
were
resting
in
their
darkened
houses
until
the
sun
got
low
and
work
and
intrigue
began
again
adam
and
kit
however
had
been
talking
for
some
time
when
the
former
leaning
back
in
a
big
cane
chair
frowned
at
his
nephew
his
thin
face
was
wet
with
sweat
but
he
shivered
and
his
hands
shook
you
can
quit
arguing
i
got
to
go
he
said
i
do
get
much
better
anyhow
and
ca
stand
for
lying
off
when
there
a
big
job
to
be
done
i
believe
i
could
see
the
job
through
kit
answered
quietly
adam
dull
eyes
sparkled
you
might
i
guess
you
anxious
to
try
your
powers
but
so
long
as
i
can
get
about
i
in
command
it
doubtful
if
you
can
get
about
kit
insisted
i
going
to
try
you
have
a
quiet
mule
ready
when
it
getting
dark
and
i
ride
out
of
town
then
if
the
saddle
shakes
me
i
go
in
a
hammock
you
can
cut
out
your
objections
the
thing
fixed
very
well
said
kit
we
had
better
make
for
corrientes
since
the
point
commands
the
port
and
the
lagoon
mayne
will
stop
for
an
hour
or
two
looking
for
a
signal
when
he
picks
up
his
marks
we
start
for
the
port
and
take
the
other
track
afterwards
there
no
use
in
telling
the
opposition
where
we
going
i
imagine
they
know
if
the
has
sailed
or
not
for
that
matter
we
do
know
kit
remarked
oh
shucks
adam
exclaimed
mayne
understands
what
we
up
against
and
he
pull
out
when
he
got
your
telegram
if
he
ca
use
his
damaged
engine
he
disconnect
and
bring
her
along
with
the
other
he
stopped
kit
with
a
frown
if
you
going
to
tell
me
the
ca
steam
across
on
one
cylinder
you
can
cut
it
out
i
taught
the
men
i
put
in
charge
that
when
a
job
needful
it
has
got
to
be
done
he
paused
and
when
kit
said
nothing
went
on
quietly
well
i
reckon
galdar
crowd
will
expect
the
boat
to
make
for
the
port
it
easier
to
land
cargo
there
and
there
a
better
road
with
good
luck
we
have
the
goods
delivered
before
they
know
she
gone
to
the
lagoon
now
you
can
go
along
and
get
busy
kit
went
away
in
a
thoughtful
mood
he
agreed
with
adam
that
secrecy
and
speed
were
essential
because
if
the
rebels
got
a
hint
of
their
plans
they
might
strike
before
alvarez
could
ensure
the
loyalty
of
his
troops
by
distributing
their
back
pay
much
depended
upon
which
party
got
in
the
first
blow
in
fact
if
the
guns
and
money
reached
the
town
before
the
rebels
knew
they
were
landed
kit
thought
the
president
chance
of
winning
was
good
all
the
same
he
imagined
that
adam
whom
the
doctor
had
forbidden
to
get
up
would
run
a
dangerous
risk
at
dusk
a
few
barefooted
soldiers
paraded
on
the
terrace
with
two
mules
and
three
or
four
peons
since
it
was
impossible
to
evade
the
watchfulness
of
galdar
spies
adam
had
resolved
to
set
off
openly
and
not
to
give
them
a
hint
that
his
journey
had
an
important
object
by
trying
to
hide
it
he
mounted
awkwardly
with
an
obvious
effort
and
when
he
was
in
the
saddle
set
his
lips
for
a
moment
or
two
then
he
turned
to
alvarez
and
smiled
i
not
a
yet
but
it
lucky
the
opposition
do
know
how
hard
it
was
for
me
to
get
up
alvarez
made
a
sign
of
understanding
you
must
dismount
as
soon
as
possible
you
are
very
staunch
my
friend
i
got
to
make
good
if
everything
is
fixed
we
pull
out
said
alvarez
taking
off
his
hat
much
depends
on
you
somebody
gave
an
order
there
was
a
rattle
of
rifles
a
patter
of
naked
feet
and
the
party
moved
away
kit
turning
after
a
few
moments
looked
back
he
saw
the
long
straight
building
pierced
here
and
there
by
lights
rise
against
the
orange
sky
and
the
tall
figure
conspicuous
in
white
clothes
in
front
of
the
arch
his
attendants
had
vanished
he
stood
motionless
as
if
brooding
and
kit
thought
he
looked
pathetic
and
lonely
he
afterwards
remembered
his
glance
at
the
old
presidio
they
rode
down
a
hot
street
the
moon
had
not
risen
and
the
place
was
dark
except
for
the
feeble
gleam
of
an
at
a
corner
the
clatter
of
the
mules
feet
on
the
uneven
stones
echoed
along
the
walls
and
here
and
there
indistinct
figures
looked
out
from
shadowy
doors
for
the
most
part
the
watchers
let
them
pass
in
silence
and
although
kit
imagined
news
of
their
departure
would
travel
fast
he
was
glad
they
passed
none
of
the
lighted
cafés
and
open
squares
it
would
be
hard
to
see
who
was
riding
the
mules
and
while
galdar
spies
would
probably
find
out
this
would
need
time
and
time
was
important
after
leaving
the
streets
they
followed
the
road
to
the
port
for
some
distance
and
then
turned
into
a
track
that
wound
along
a
dark
hillside
among
clumps
of
trees
when
they
entered
it
adam
stopped
his
mule
and
got
down
awkwardly
i
had
about
as
much
as
i
can
stand
for
he
remarked
breathing
hard
looks
as
if
we
had
got
a
start
but
i
reckon
the
other
lot
will
try
to
track
us
to
the
port
when
the
moon
gets
up
then
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
lay
down
in
a
hammock
the
peons
had
got
ready
and
when
two
of
the
latter
took
up
the
poles
they
went
on
again
on
the
second
night
after
leaving
the
presidio
kit
sat
on
the
coaming
of
a
small
steam
launch
that
lurched
across
the
long
undulations
rolling
in
from
the
caribbean
it
had
been
blowing
fresh
and
although
the
wind
had
dropped
the
swell
ran
high
when
the
launch
swung
up
a
vague
hazy
smear
rather
suggested
than
indicated
land
astern
the
sea
ahead
was
dark
but
in
one
place
a
faint
reflection
on
the
sky
told
that
the
moon
would
soon
rise
although
the
beach
was
some
distance
off
a
dull
monotonous
rumble
pierced
now
and
then
by
the
clank
of
the
launch
engines
hinted
at
breaking
surf
the
furnace
door
was
open
and
the
red
light
touched
face
as
he
sat
supported
by
a
cushion
in
a
corner
of
the
cockpit
he
looked
very
haggard
and
kit
thought
him
the
worse
for
his
journey
the
light
in
my
eyes
but
there
was
nothing
on
the
skyline
a
minute
or
two
ago
kit
remarked
it
will
be
awkward
if
mayne
does
get
across
you
seem
persuaded
he
come
i
know
he
start
we
ca
tell
what
may
have
happened
afterwards
and
there
was
more
wind
than
i
liked
he
be
here
on
time
if
he
been
able
to
keep
the
old
boat
off
the
ground
time
is
getting
short
i
expect
the
rebels
have
found
out
we
not
at
the
port
and
galdar
will
have
the
road
watched
when
the
news
gets
to
the
town
it
might
pay
him
to
risk
forcing
a
conflict
if
he
could
seize
the
convoy
and
i
feel
happier
when
the
guns
and
money
are
off
our
hands
it
will
be
the
president
business
to
look
after
them
then
that
so
adam
agreed
our
part
of
the
job
to
land
the
goods
and
it
unlucky
the
tides
are
small
there
wo
be
much
water
on
the
shoals
and
although
we
have
an
extra
few
inches
tomorrow
i
want
mayne
to
wait
kit
pondered
for
he
had
taken
some
soundings
when
coming
out
they
were
probably
not
correct
because
the
launch
had
rolled
among
the
white
combers
that
swept
the
shoals
while
he
used
the
lead
but
the
average
depth
was
about
the
steamer
draught
in
her
usual
trim
mayne
however
ought
to
know
what
depth
to
expect
and
kit
hoped
he
had
loaded
the
vessel
to
correspond
by
and
by
the
mulatto
fireman
shut
the
furnace
door
the
puzzling
light
was
cut
off
and
kit
searched
the
horizon
for
some
minutes
he
saw
nothing
and
then
a
trail
of
red
fire
soared
into
the
sky
he
brought
her
across
said
adam
get
our
rocket
off
the
rocket
swept
up
in
a
wide
curve
and
burst
into
crimson
lights
after
this
there
was
darkness
for
a
time
until
an
indistinct
black
object
appeared
against
the
brightening
sky
then
the
launch
sank
back
into
the
trough
where
the
gloom
was
only
broken
by
the
glimmer
of
the
phosphorescence
that
spangled
the
water
when
she
swung
up
on
the
top
of
the
next
swell
the
steamer
was
plainer
and
kit
blew
the
whistle
as
he
changed
their
course
when
the
moon
rose
slowly
out
of
the
sea
he
stopped
the
clanking
engine
and
the
launch
reeled
up
and
down
some
fifty
yards
off
the
steamer
the
negro
no
lights
but
the
phosphorescence
shone
upon
her
wet
plates
as
she
rolled
them
out
of
the
water
her
side
rose
high
and
black
and
then
sank
until
her
rail
was
nearly
level
with
the
spangled
foam
indistinct
figures
scrambled
about
her
deck
and
when
kit
sheered
the
launch
in
her
ladder
went
down
with
a
rattle
a
on
board
the
launch
caught
it
with
his
boat
hook
and
adam
stood
at
the
bow
waiting
for
a
chance
to
jump
upon
the
narrow
platform
that
lurched
up
above
him
and
then
plunged
into
the
sea
kit
felt
anxious
he
did
not
think
adam
was
equal
to
the
effort
and
dreaded
the
consequences
of
the
shock
if
he
missed
and
fell
stand
by
he
shouted
to
the
seaman
on
the
ladder
when
the
steadied
after
a
violent
roll
and
then
touched
adam
now
before
she
goes
back
adam
jumping
awkwardly
seized
the
seaman
hand
and
kit
leaning
out
pushed
him
on
to
the
platform
as
it
began
to
sink
then
he
jumped
and
coming
down
in
a
foot
or
two
of
water
helped
adam
to
the
deck
mayne
met
them
at
the
gangway
and
took
them
to
his
room
where
adam
sat
down
and
gasped
when
mayne
poured
out
some
liquor
he
clutched
the
glass
with
a
shaking
hand
after
he
drained
it
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
asked
in
a
strained
voice
have
you
brought
the
goods
got
them
all
we
had
a
nice
trip
do
know
how
finlay
kept
her
going
and
i
thought
i
lost
her
on
tortillas
reef
but
we
can
talk
about
that
afterwards
adam
made
a
sign
of
satisfaction
and
leaned
back
feebly
it
some
relief
to
know
the
goods
are
here
finlay
can
drive
her
seven
knots
and
has
plenty
steam
mayne
said
to
kit
i
bothered
about
the
water
there
wo
be
too
much
kit
asked
the
vessel
draught
and
looked
thoughtful
when
he
heard
what
it
was
i
ca
guarantee
my
soundings
but
imagine
she
wo
float
across
and
an
ugly
sea
is
running
on
the
bar
she
certainly
hit
the
bottom
and
the
chances
are
she
hits
it
hard
mayne
remarked
when
kit
told
him
the
depth
he
had
got
i
expect
too
the
mist
will
drift
off
from
the
mangroves
with
the
and
hide
our
marks
he
paused
and
glanced
at
adam
who
leaned
back
in
a
corner
with
his
eyes
half
shut
but
i
reckon
we
have
got
to
take
her
in
yes
said
adam
dully
leave
me
alone
you
can
fix
things
with
kit
mayne
beckoned
kit
and
they
went
to
the
bridge
the
moon
had
risen
and
threw
a
belt
of
silver
light
across
the
sea
but
it
was
a
half
moon
and
would
not
help
them
much
ahead
in
the
distance
gray
haze
obscured
the
water
and
the
dull
roar
that
came
out
of
the
mist
had
become
distinct
mayne
rang
his
telegraph
to
reduce
the
speed
so
far
as
i
can
reckon
it
wo
be
for
most
two
hours
and
on
this
coast
you
ca
calculate
just
how
much
the
tide
will
rise
there
going
to
be
trouble
if
we
find
it
shoaler
than
we
expect
and
i
had
plenty
trouble
coming
along
finlay
could
hardly
drive
her
four
knots
in
last
night
breeze
and
the
current
put
us
on
tortillas
reef
she
stopped
there
twenty
minutes
jambed
down
on
her
bilge
while
the
sea
came
on
board
kit
noted
two
boats
that
had
obviously
been
damaged
while
the
steamer
hammered
on
the
reef
and
the
white
crust
of
salt
on
the
funnel
but
mayne
resumed
say
the
old
man
looks
shaky
never
seen
him
like
that
you
want
to
get
him
home
he
wo
go
however
he
rather
worse
tonight
i
think
he
was
anxious
about
your
turning
up
in
time
to
catch
the
tide
the
journey
tried
him
and
now
a
reaction
has
begun
well
i
allow
there
not
much
use
in
arguing
if
he
means
to
stay
but
he
need
have
bothered
about
my
getting
across
when
the
orders
came
i
knew
i
had
to
bring
her
or
pile
her
up
what
askew
says
goes
they
were
silent
for
a
time
while
the
with
engines
throbbing
slowly
crept
towards
the
coast
the
land
breeze
brought
off
a
steamy
heat
and
a
sour
smell
the
long
undulations
were
wrinkled
by
small
waves
and
a
thin
low
haze
that
obscured
the
moon
spread
across
the
water
kit
looking
up
now
and
then
could
see
the
mastheads
swing
across
the
sky
there
was
however
nothing
to
be
seen
ahead
but
a
gray
line
that
moved
back
as
the
steamer
went
on
it
sure
a
blamed
bad
night
for
our
job
mayne
remarked
as
he
gazed
towards
the
hidden
land
i
glad
i
told
your
dagos
to
burn
a
flare
when
they
hit
the
channel
kit
said
nothing
the
launch
had
vanished
and
there
was
no
guiding
light
in
the
mist
the
turmoil
of
the
surf
had
got
louder
and
rang
through
the
dark
like
the
roar
of
a
heavy
train
presently
mayne
ordered
a
sounding
to
be
taken
and
looked
at
kit
when
the
leadsman
called
the
depth
a
foot
less
than
we
reckoned
and
there
wo
be
much
rise
i
do
like
it
askew
and
if
my
employer
was
not
your
uncle
i
heave
the
old
boat
round
kit
nodded
sympathetically
he
felt
he
hated
the
smothering
haze
that
rolled
in
front
and
hid
the
dangers
but
they
must
go
on
and
trust
to
luck
he
knew
adam
plans
and
no
arguments
would
shake
his
resolve
half
an
hour
later
a
twinkle
broke
out
some
distance
ahead
and
mayne
rang
his
telegraph
i
thankful
for
that
anyhow
he
remarked
we
let
her
go
but
i
have
my
doubts
about
what
will
happen
next
the
throb
of
engines
quickened
the
gurgle
of
water
got
louder
at
the
bows
and
the
lurching
sharply
went
shorewards
with
tide
and
swell
the
twinkle
vanished
and
reappeared
to
starboard
now
and
chains
rattled
as
the
quartermaster
pulled
round
the
wheel
then
the
light
faded
and
they
were
left
without
a
guide
in
the
puzzling
haze
ten
minutes
afterwards
there
was
a
heavy
shock
and
a
rush
of
foam
swept
the
rail
as
the
steamer
listed
down
she
lifted
and
struck
again
with
a
jar
that
tried
kit
nerve
a
hoarse
shout
came
from
the
forecastle
and
men
ran
about
the
slanted
deck
as
a
frothing
sea
rolled
on
board
mayne
clutching
his
telegraph
beckoned
kit
bring
askew
up
he
got
to
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
kit
met
adam
clumsily
climbing
the
ladder
and
when
he
helped
him
to
the
bridge
mayne
remarked
she
on
the
tongue
shoal
do
know
if
i
can
back
her
off
and
steam
out
to
deep
water
but
if
you
consent
i
want
to
try
i
wo
consent
said
adam
we
going
in
what
that
light
to
starboard
the
launch
she
in
the
channel
i
doubt
if
there
water
enough
for
us
if
we
can
get
there
then
shove
her
across
the
sand
or
let
her
go
to
bits
mayne
rang
the
telegraph
and
touched
his
cap
very
well
she
your
ship
and
we
have
some
sound
boats
left
for
the
next
ten
minutes
kit
clung
to
the
bridge
he
wanted
to
help
adam
into
the
but
the
old
man
waved
him
off
clouds
of
spray
swept
the
vessel
and
made
it
hard
to
see
her
rail
where
the
white
combers
leaped
now
and
then
one
broke
on
board
and
poured
in
a
foaming
torrent
across
the
slanted
deck
she
trembled
horribly
as
she
struck
the
sand
it
looked
as
if
she
were
driving
sideways
across
the
shoal
but
the
flare
on
the
launch
had
gone
out
and
kit
doubted
if
mayne
knew
where
he
was
sometimes
the
tall
black
forecastle
swung
in
a
sometimes
the
stern
went
round
for
the
most
part
however
she
lay
with
her
side
to
the
rollers
and
it
was
plain
that
the
struggle
could
not
last
long
if
they
did
not
get
off
in
a
few
minutes
rivets
would
smash
and
butts
open
and
one
must
take
one
chances
in
the
boats
two
were
damaged
but
others
might
be
launched
and
kit
was
relieved
to
note
that
two
or
three
moved
about
as
if
engaged
in
clearing
the
he
sympathized
with
the
men
although
he
did
not
think
mayne
had
given
them
orders
in
the
meantime
adam
clung
to
the
rails
swaying
when
the
bridge
slanted
but
looking
unmoved
and
kit
knew
that
so
long
as
the
engines
turned
he
would
go
on
it
was
not
for
nothing
men
called
him
the
buccaneer
and
now
that
he
was
staking
his
life
and
fortune
on
a
hazardous
chance
there
was
something
daunting
about
his
grim
resolve
a
sea
rolled
up
astern
and
buried
the
poop
kit
felt
the
steamer
lift
and
turn
as
if
on
a
pivot
at
the
middle
of
her
length
the
was
full
of
water
but
the
bows
were
high
and
going
round
and
he
was
conscious
of
a
curious
shiver
that
ran
through
the
straining
hull
as
she
shook
herself
free
from
the
sand
she
crawled
forward
stopped
and
moved
again
with
a
staggering
lurch
the
next
sea
swept
her
on
but
she
did
not
strike
and
after
a
few
moments
kit
knew
she
had
crossed
the
top
of
the
shoal
her
whistle
shrieked
above
the
turmoil
of
the
sea
a
light
blinked
in
the
spray
and
she
lurched
on
before
the
tumbling
combers
by
and
by
the
water
got
smooth
and
an
indistinct
dark
mass
grew
out
of
the
mist
mayne
who
was
pacing
up
and
down
his
bridge
stopped
near
kit
with
a
reckless
laugh
this
is
the
kind
of
navigation
they
break
skippers
for
if
those
are
the
mangroves
on
false
point
i
may
take
her
in
if
they
not
we
make
a
hole
in
the
forest
kit
looked
about
but
could
not
see
the
launch
the
dark
mass
was
a
thick
belt
of
trees
but
he
did
not
know
and
did
not
think
mayne
knew
where
they
were
and
the
easy
motion
indicated
that
the
tide
was
carrying
the
steamer
on
much
to
his
relief
the
indistinct
wall
of
forest
seemed
to
bend
back
away
from
the
sea
it
looked
as
if
they
were
entering
the
lagoon
and
then
he
heard
the
telegraph
and
the
rattle
of
rudder
chains
the
screw
shook
the
vessel
as
it
spun
and
the
bows
began
to
swing
it
was
however
too
late
the
forecastle
would
not
clear
the
mangroves
and
kit
knew
the
water
was
deep
among
their
roots
shouting
to
adam
he
seized
the
rails
and
waited
for
the
shock
it
came
for
there
was
a
crash
and
a
noise
of
branches
breaking
the
steamer
rolled
recoiled
and
forged
on
into
the
forest
some
minutes
later
mayne
stopped
his
engines
and
there
was
a
curious
quietness
as
he
came
up
to
adam
we
are
fast
in
the
mud
sir
although
she
take
a
list
when
the
tide
falls
we
may
be
able
to
work
cargo
i
lay
out
an
anchor
in
the
morning
and
try
to
heave
her
off
but
i
calculate
it
will
be
full
moon
before
she
floats
chapter
vii
the
mangrove
swamp
early
next
morning
kit
went
on
deck
although
it
was
hot
everything
dripped
with
damp
and
mist
drifted
past
the
ship
her
masts
and
funnels
slanted
and
kit
could
hardly
keep
his
footing
on
the
inclined
deck
when
he
looked
over
the
rail
the
rows
of
wet
plates
ran
up
like
a
wall
above
broken
mangrove
roots
and
pools
of
slime
smashed
trunks
and
branches
were
piled
against
the
bows
and
dingy
foliage
overhung
the
vessel
lower
side
kit
walked
aft
the
screw
was
uncovered
and
shallow
muddy
water
dotted
by
floating
scum
surrounded
the
stern
which
projected
into
the
lagoon
in
one
place
however
a
touched
the
bilge
and
three
or
four
men
standing
on
planks
cautiously
tried
its
firmness
they
were
wet
and
splashed
and
one
who
ventured
a
few
yards
from
the
plank
sank
to
his
waist
the
others
pulled
him
out
and
then
they
climbed
a
rope
ladder
kit
thought
the
experiment
proved
that
nothing
useful
could
be
done
until
the
tide
flowed
round
the
ship
another
gang
was
moving
a
across
the
deck
while
a
few
more
coiled
heavy
ropes
beside
the
winch
mayne
obviously
meant
to
try
to
heave
the
vessel
off
but
kit
thought
he
would
not
succeed
until
the
moon
was
full
in
the
meantime
cargo
could
only
be
landed
when
there
was
water
enough
to
float
boats
up
to
the
ship
and
kit
glanced
across
the
lagoon
there
were
no
mangroves
on
the
other
side
although
thick
timber
grew
close
down
to
a
belt
of
sand
below
this
was
mud
across
which
he
imagined
heavy
goods
could
not
be
carried
the
heat
and
steamy
damp
made
him
languid
and
he
went
to
adam
room
adam
had
got
up
and
sat
on
the
lower
berth
with
a
glass
on
the
floor
close
by
his
hands
shook
and
there
was
no
color
in
his
lips
it
rather
early
for
a
strong
cocktail
but
i
felt
i
needed
bracing
he
said
what
do
you
think
about
our
chance
of
getting
her
off
i
imagine
it
impossible
for
another
week
and
do
see
how
we
get
the
cargo
out
do
you
said
adam
grimly
it
has
got
to
be
done
if
mayne
finds
the
job
too
big
i
put
it
through
myself
you
ought
to
leave
before
the
malaria
knocks
you
down
kit
rejoined
if
i
had
the
power
i
make
you
go
adam
smiled
you
mean
well
boy
but
you
do
understand
and
if
you
plot
with
mayne
to
bluff
me
i
surely
break
you
both
now
go
and
see
if
the
president
men
have
arrived
then
you
can
tell
mayne
to
rig
his
derricks
and
take
the
hatches
off
kit
went
out
and
after
a
time
three
or
four
figures
appeared
among
the
trees
across
the
lagoon
they
came
down
to
the
mud
but
when
kit
shouted
asking
if
they
could
launch
a
canoe
one
shrugged
and
they
turned
back
i
reckon
the
old
man
means
us
to
get
busy
with
the
cargo
mayne
remarked
yes
said
kit
i
understand
he
ready
to
undertake
the
job
if
we
find
it
too
much
for
us
he
a
hustler
sure
so
far
as
i
can
see
the
thing
ca
be
done
but
if
askew
wants
it
done
i
guess
we
got
to
try
we
carry
out
the
kedge
and
make
fast
a
warp
or
two
when
the
tide
flows
he
expect
it
though
i
do
reckon
much
on
our
chance
of
floating
her
by
degrees
the
muddy
water
crawled
up
the
plates
and
the
rose
upright
the
haze
melted
and
it
got
fiercely
hot
when
the
sun
shone
a
canoe
manned
by
peons
crossed
the
lagoon
and
with
heavy
labor
the
was
hoisted
out
and
hung
between
two
boats
men
toiled
at
the
oars
until
the
lashings
were
cut
and
the
boats
rocked
as
the
anchor
sank
then
their
crews
dragging
large
stiff
warps
forced
their
way
among
the
mangrove
roots
and
made
the
ropes
fast
where
they
could
they
came
back
exhausted
dripping
with
water
and
daubed
by
slime
and
mayne
went
to
the
bridge
the
sun
pierced
the
narrow
awning
and
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
the
lagoon
shone
with
dazzling
brightness
and
the
iron
deck
threw
up
an
intolerable
heat
kit
felt
the
perspiration
soak
his
thin
clothes
and
big
drops
of
moisture
trickled
down
adam
yellow
face
as
he
sat
with
eyes
in
a
canvas
chair
by
and
by
he
took
out
his
watch
and
kit
noted
that
he
moved
it
once
or
twice
before
he
could
see
the
time
had
you
better
get
busy
he
asked
mayne
the
telegraph
clanged
the
engines
panted
and
the
began
to
shake
as
the
screw
revolved
there
was
no
movement
but
the
racking
throb
until
mayne
raised
his
hand
and
winch
and
windlass
rattled
puffs
of
steam
blew
about
the
cable
rose
from
the
water
with
a
jar
and
the
warps
ran
slowly
across
the
foul
with
greasy
scum
hold
on
to
it
mayne
shouted
get
in
the
last
inch
his
voice
was
drowned
by
the
rattle
of
chain
and
hiss
of
steam
but
the
uproar
began
to
die
away
and
the
sharp
clatter
of
small
engines
changed
to
spasmodic
jars
then
somebody
shouted
there
was
a
crash
and
the
end
of
a
broken
warp
flying
back
tore
up
the
dazzling
water
the
windlass
stopped
and
a
few
moments
later
a
clump
of
mangroves
swayed
kit
heard
green
wood
crack
as
a
rope
that
had
stretched
and
strained
began
to
move
then
mayne
raised
his
hand
let
go
stop
her
you
pulling
up
the
trees
there
was
a
sudden
quietness
except
for
the
insistent
throb
of
the
screw
and
mayne
turned
to
adam
if
the
cable
holds
i
can
smash
the
windlass
but
i
ca
heave
her
off
very
well
you
quit
and
get
the
cargo
out
better
hustle
while
she
upright
mayne
went
down
the
ladder
and
when
he
unlocked
the
iron
door
of
the
after
a
gang
of
men
brought
out
a
row
of
a
mulatto
from
the
beach
who
wore
neat
white
clothes
and
an
expensive
hat
counted
the
boxes
and
then
gave
adam
a
receipt
don
hernando
will
be
glad
to
get
these
goods
and
we
will
start
at
once
he
said
although
i
have
a
guard
it
will
be
safe
to
reach
the
town
before
the
president
enemies
know
that
would
be
prudent
señor
adam
agreed
and
turned
to
kit
when
the
mulatto
went
away
i
have
done
my
part
and
it
alvarez
business
to
see
the
chests
get
through
well
we
have
both
taken
some
chances
since
he
was
a
and
i
a
running
the
old
but
i
reckon
this
is
my
rashest
plunge
anyhow
if
i
get
my
money
back
or
not
i
put
up
the
goods
now
you
can
tell
mayne
to
break
out
the
guns
mayne
gave
orders
swung
from
the
stumpy
masts
pulleys
rattled
and
heavy
cases
rose
from
the
holds
the
boats
however
could
not
get
abreast
of
the
forward
hatch
and
the
cases
had
to
be
moved
across
slippery
iron
plates
to
the
after
derrick
that
hoisted
them
overboard
it
was
exhausting
work
and
the
heat
was
intolerable
the
white
crew
threw
off
their
soaked
clothes
and
toiled
in
the
sun
that
burned
their
skin
but
adam
left
the
awning
and
went
about
in
the
glare
at
first
the
mates
grumbled
with
indignant
surprise
their
employer
was
breaking
rules
working
the
cargo
was
their
business
and
nobody
else
must
meddle
besides
they
had
not
met
a
shipowner
able
to
superintend
the
job
one
who
ventured
a
protest
however
stopped
in
awkward
embarrassment
when
adam
gave
him
a
look
and
the
others
soon
admitted
that
few
captains
knew
more
about
derricks
and
slings
nevertheless
kit
was
anxious
as
he
watched
his
uncle
he
knew
adam
would
pay
for
this
and
wondered
how
long
he
could
keep
it
up
at
noon
the
peons
refused
another
load
and
when
adam
addressed
them
in
virulent
castilian
coolly
pulled
the
boats
away
from
the
ship
when
they
had
rowed
a
short
distance
they
stopped
and
one
got
up
more
is
not
possible
señor
he
said
to
work
in
this
sun
is
not
for
flesh
and
blood
after
we
have
slept
for
an
hour
or
two
we
will
come
back
adam
felt
for
his
pistol
but
hesitated
with
his
hand
at
his
silk
belt
and
kit
thought
he
looked
very
like
a
buccaneer
it
might
pay
to
plug
that
fellow
and
i
have
risked
it
when
i
came
here
in
the
still
i
guess
don
hernando
has
enough
trouble
mayne
standing
behind
him
grinned
i
reckon
that
fixes
the
thing
do
know
i
sorry
the
dagos
have
lit
out
my
crowd
are
used
up
and
ready
to
mutiny
for
two
hours
the
tired
crew
rested
while
the
water
sank
and
the
steamer
resumed
her
awkward
list
then
the
boats
came
back
and
the
men
crawled
languidly
about
the
slanted
deck
until
adam
went
among
them
with
bitter
words
the
sea
breeze
was
blowing
outside
but
no
wind
could
enter
the
gap
in
the
trees
and
foul
exhalations
from
warm
mud
and
slime
poisoned
the
stagnant
air
kit
head
ached
his
eyes
hurt
and
his
joints
were
sore
he
felt
strangely
limp
and
it
cost
him
an
effort
to
get
about
all
the
while
the
winches
hammered
and
pulleys
screamed
as
the
cases
came
up
and
the
empty
slings
went
down
the
heat
got
suffocating
and
the
slant
of
masts
and
deck
made
matters
worse
because
the
men
must
hold
the
derricks
back
with
guys
while
the
heavy
goods
cleared
the
coamings
of
the
hatch
much
judgment
was
needed
to
drop
them
safely
in
the
boats
men
gasped
and
choked
quarreled
with
each
other
and
growled
at
the
mates
but
somehow
held
on
while
the
tide
ebbed
and
the
sun
sank
nearer
the
mangroves
tops
it
dipped
when
the
breathless
peons
pushed
the
last
boat
away
from
the
side
and
the
noisy
machines
stopped
darkness
spread
swiftly
across
the
lagoon
and
a
white
fog
hot
and
damp
as
steam
rose
from
the
forest
and
hung
about
the
ship
everything
was
very
quiet
for
the
men
were
too
limp
to
talk
but
a
murmur
came
out
of
the
distance
where
the
long
swell
beat
upon
the
shoals
kit
and
mayne
sat
in
the
with
a
jug
of
iced
liquor
on
the
table
in
front
sometimes
they
spoke
a
few
words
and
sometimes
smoked
in
silence
while
adam
lay
on
the
settee
saying
nothing
at
length
he
got
up
and
a
steward
helped
him
to
his
room
somehow
the
others
felt
it
a
relief
that
he
had
gone
i
can
hustle
but
your
uncle
makes
me
tired
mayne
remarked
if
you
get
what
i
mean
it
like
watching
a
dead
man
chase
the
boys
about
you
feel
it
unnatural
to
see
him
on
his
feet
well
one
has
to
pay
for
fooling
with
a
climate
like
this
and
i
afraid
the
bill
he
get
will
break
him
ca
you
make
him
quit
i
ca
i
tried
the
curious
thing
is
he
knows
the
cost
mayne
resumed
knows
coming
to
him
unless
he
goes
yes
said
kit
in
a
thoughtful
voice
i
believe
he
does
know
and
does
mind
this
makes
it
rough
on
me
i
powerless
to
send
him
off
and
i
fond
of
the
old
man
mayne
made
a
sign
of
agreement
he
a
pretty
tough
proposition
and
was
worse
when
he
was
young
but
i
risked
my
life
to
serve
him
the
buccaneer
holds
his
friends
kit
said
nothing
he
was
anxious
and
depressed
and
soon
went
off
to
bed
when
work
began
next
morning
adam
was
on
deck
and
superintended
the
landing
of
the
cargo
in
spite
of
kit
protest
kit
thought
the
day
was
hotter
than
the
last
and
after
an
hour
or
two
disturbed
sleep
in
his
stifling
room
found
it
hard
to
drag
himself
about
when
the
exhausted
peons
stopped
at
noon
he
lay
under
the
awning
and
kept
close
to
adam
when
they
resumed
he
did
not
like
his
uncle
fixed
frown
and
thought
it
was
caused
by
the
effort
he
made
to
keep
at
work
if
not
it
was
a
hint
of
pain
he
stubbornly
tried
to
overcome
besides
his
step
was
dragging
and
his
movements
were
awkward
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
adam
stood
near
the
noisy
winch
while
a
case
was
hoisted
the
looked
up
when
the
heavy
load
hanging
from
the
derrick
swung
across
the
slanted
deck
hold
her
while
they
steady
the
boom
adam
shouted
and
seized
the
rope
that
slipped
round
the
drum
the
was
watching
the
others
who
struggled
with
the
guy
and
perhaps
forgot
it
was
not
a
strong
man
who
had
come
to
his
help
for
a
moment
or
two
adam
kept
his
grip
and
then
his
hands
opened
and
he
staggered
back
somebody
shouted
a
pulley
rattled
and
the
case
running
down
crashed
against
the
steamer
rail
kit
ran
forward
but
reached
the
spot
a
moment
too
late
for
adam
lay
unconscious
on
the
iron
deck
they
picked
him
up
and
carried
him
to
the
bridge
where
it
was
a
little
cooler
than
his
room
but
for
some
time
he
did
not
open
his
eyes
then
he
looked
about
dully
and
seeing
kit
gave
him
a
feeble
smile
you
in
charge
now
partner
keep
the
boys
hustling
he
said
there
the
coffee
to
load
up
when
you
have
put
the
guns
ashore
looks
as
if
i
had
got
to
leave
the
job
to
you
he
turned
his
head
drew
a
hard
breath
as
if
it
had
hurt
him
to
speak
and
said
nothing
more
the
work
however
went
on
until
it
got
dark
and
when
the
mist
rose
from
the
mangroves
and
a
heavy
dew
began
to
fall
they
carried
adam
to
his
room
he
slept
for
part
of
the
night
while
kit
watched
but
now
and
then
tossed
about
with
delirious
mutterings
when
morning
came
he
did
not
wake
and
kit
looking
at
his
pinched
wet
face
went
on
deck
with
a
heavy
heart
he
had
sent
for
the
spanish
doctor
but
thought
it
did
not
matter
much
if
señor
martin
came
or
not
in
another
day
or
two
he
would
be
alone
chapter
ix
adam
last
request
it
was
nearly
full
moon
the
night
was
calm
and
the
flowing
tide
rippled
among
the
mangrove
roots
clammy
vapor
drifted
about
the
ship
and
big
drops
fell
from
the
rigging
and
splashed
upon
the
deck
a
plume
of
smoke
went
nearly
straight
up
from
the
funnel
and
now
and
then
the
clang
of
and
shovel
rose
from
the
stokehold
for
mayne
hoped
to
float
the
vessel
next
tide
for
the
most
part
however
the
men
were
asleep
and
it
was
very
quiet
in
the
room
under
the
poop
a
lamp
tilted
at
a
sharp
angle
gave
a
feeble
light
that
touched
adam
face
kit
sat
on
a
locker
opposite
looking
anxious
and
worn
you
loaded
up
some
of
the
coffee
adam
remarked
in
a
strained
voice
half
of
it
i
think
the
rest
on
the
beach
said
kit
it
doubtful
if
we
get
the
next
lot
since
señor
martin
understands
the
fighting
has
begun
the
lot
you
have
shipped
will
be
something
to
score
against
the
account
it
prime
coffee
and
ought
to
sell
well
i
like
you
to
get
the
rubber
but
alvarez
ca
wait
long
for
the
goods
mackellar
has
ready
for
the
boat
another
voyage
and
you
can
pull
out
for
the
old
country
reckoned
on
going
with
you
but
that
done
with
kit
said
nothing
the
doctor
had
come
and
gone
for
he
was
needed
elsewhere
and
could
not
help
the
sick
man
one
could
indulge
him
and
make
things
comfortable
for
a
few
days
but
that
was
all
he
said
and
kit
saw
that
adam
knew
by
and
by
the
latter
resumed
i
been
thinking
about
peter
and
ashness
i
have
liked
to
see
the
old
place
and
the
fells
again
and
when
i
was
half
asleep
i
thought
i
heard
the
beck
splash
among
the
thorns
and
the
crying
well
you
are
going
back
and
you
marry
that
girl
though
it
will
cost
you
something
to
see
alvarez
through
you
ought
to
be
rich
enough
you
must
talk
too
much
said
kit
señor
martin
told
you
to
rest
adam
smiled
it
does
matter
now
if
i
rest
or
not
my
brain
clearer
and
i
talk
while
i
can
i
never
told
you
much
about
my
early
life
but
i
going
to
do
so
because
there
something
i
want
to
ask
then
you
have
only
to
ask
it
kit
replied
i
know
said
adam
feebly
you
staunch
well
you
have
seen
the
in
the
office
marked
though
i
lost
the
old
boat
long
before
you
came
out
she
was
a
and
did
pay
to
run
but
i
kept
her
going
until
she
hit
the
reef
my
first
steamboat
i
got
her
when
she
was
going
cheap
but
she
was
bought
with
my
money
and
called
after
her
i
met
hattie
in
florida
about
the
year
you
were
born
she
was
vanhuyten
cousin
and
the
finest
thing
that
ever
wore
a
woman
shape
northern
grit
and
southern
fire
for
she
sprang
from
new
england
and
good
virginia
stock
i
seen
no
woman
with
her
superb
confidence
well
i
was
a
with
some
ugly
tales
against
my
name
but
i
fell
in
love
with
hattie
and
married
her
in
a
month
adam
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
and
while
kit
mused
shovels
clinked
in
the
stokehold
and
the
vessel
began
to
lift
the
tilted
lamp
straightened
and
its
light
rested
on
adam
wasted
form
his
silk
pyjamas
rather
emphasized
than
hid
his
gauntness
he
looked
strangely
worn
and
weak
but
kit
could
picture
the
strong
passion
of
his
there
was
something
fierce
and
primitive
about
the
old
buccaneer
and
it
was
not
hard
to
see
how
he
had
so
to
speak
swept
the
romantic
girl
off
her
feet
by
the
fiery
spirit
that
had
burned
him
out
yet
he
had
never
talked
about
other
women
and
though
he
knew
the
south
kit
thought
he
had
cared
for
none
i
left
her
in
a
few
weeks
adam
went
on
alvarez
was
putting
up
for
president
and
my
savings
were
at
stake
hattie
went
home
to
virginia
while
i
helped
alvarez
on
the
coast
he
was
hard
up
against
it
though
he
been
president
three
times
since
well
when
things
looked
blackest
i
was
knocked
out
in
salinas
swamps
by
fever
and
a
bullet
that
touched
my
lungs
they
took
me
to
the
old
indian
mission
we
were
cut
off
from
the
ship
and
father
herman
put
the
off
my
track
i
sent
him
wine
and
candles
he
at
the
mission
yet
it
stands
between
thick
forest
and
swamps
like
this
and
the
padre
the
only
white
man
who
has
lived
there
long
get
down
the
chart
and
i
show
you
the
landing
place
kit
did
so
feeling
that
he
ought
to
indulge
a
sick
man
caprice
and
adam
after
giving
him
clear
directions
was
quiet
for
some
minutes
then
he
began
again
with
an
effort
vanhuyten
told
hattie
and
i
found
out
afterwards
that
she
had
had
trouble
at
home
her
folks
had
never
trusted
me
and
wanted
to
keep
her
back
but
she
had
rich
friends
who
sent
her
out
like
an
american
princess
on
a
big
steam
yacht
she
got
to
the
mission
when
i
was
at
my
worst
and
finding
i
could
not
be
moved
sent
the
yacht
away
it
was
some
days
before
i
knew
she
had
come
there
was
no
doctor
to
be
got
alvarez
could
not
send
help
and
the
government
soldiers
were
hunting
for
his
friends
but
father
herman
knew
something
about
medicine
and
hattie
helped
him
better
than
a
trained
nurse
i
can
see
her
now
going
about
the
room
in
her
clean
white
dress
without
a
hint
of
weariness
in
her
gentle
eyes
that
was
when
she
thought
i
was
watching
but
sometimes
at
night
her
head
bent
and
her
figure
drooped
it
was
blisteringly
hot
and
when
the
sun
went
down
the
poisonous
steam
from
the
swamps
drifted
round
the
spot
sometimes
i
begged
her
not
to
stay
and
sometimes
i
raged
but
hattie
could
not
be
moved
and
my
weak
anger
broke
before
her
smiles
she
was
strong
and
would
not
get
fever
she
said
she
had
come
to
nurse
me
and
if
i
insisted
would
go
home
when
i
was
well
adam
stopped
and
asked
for
a
drink
and
afterwards
kit
hoped
he
had
gone
to
sleep
but
he
presently
roused
himself
again
i
have
got
to
finish
partner
because
there
a
reason
you
should
hear
it
all
by
and
by
father
herman
had
to
nurse
us
both
and
when
i
got
better
hattie
died
we
buried
her
by
torchlight
in
the
dusty
mission
yard
she
was
a
catholic
you
see
the
marble
cross
i
been
lonely
ever
since
and
that
partly
why
i
sent
for
you
peter
came
next
to
hattie
and
you
are
peter
son
now
i
ready
to
pull
out
and
somehow
i
think
hattie
will
find
me
when
i
wandering
in
the
dark
love
like
hers
is
strong
but
i
want
you
to
listen
when
you
have
given
me
another
drink
kit
held
the
glass
to
adam
cracked
lips
he
drank
and
lay
still
breathing
hard
and
kit
heard
the
ripple
of
the
tide
the
was
getting
upright
and
as
the
lamp
turned
in
its
socket
the
light
moved
across
the
wall
after
a
time
adam
resumed
in
a
clearer
voice
all
i
have
is
yours
mackellar
will
prove
the
will
but
you
see
alvarez
out
as
i
meant
to
do
another
thing
mayne
will
get
the
old
boat
off
tomorrow
and
when
he
loaded
up
i
want
you
to
take
me
out
and
land
me
on
the
creek
i
marked
behind
salinas
point
he
can
fly
the
flag
i
have
started
on
the
lone
trail
then
you
hire
some
boys
at
the
in
the
swamp
and
take
me
to
the
mission
and
lay
me
beside
my
wife
hattie
was
a
catholic
and
you
can
tell
father
herman
that
what
she
believed
was
good
enough
for
me
afterwards
send
him
now
and
then
the
box
of
candles
he
will
tell
you
about
to
burn
in
the
little
chapel
before
our
lady
of
sorrows
where
hattie
used
to
pray
i
might
get
well
you
do
this
for
me
i
will
kit
answered
with
forced
quietness
then
i
finished
said
adam
i
going
to
sleep
now
and
may
talk
much
again
he
turned
his
head
from
the
light
and
presently
kit
hearing
him
breathe
quietly
went
out
on
deck
at
next
day
the
floated
off
the
mud
and
when
she
swung
to
her
anchor
kit
went
into
adam
room
adam
was
very
weak
but
looked
up
get
the
coffee
on
board
i
afraid
you
wo
have
time
for
the
next
lot
and
the
rubber
he
said
tell
finlay
to
bank
his
fires
you
want
steam
to
take
me
out
kit
understood
and
nodded
because
he
could
not
speak
and
adam
giving
him
a
quiet
smile
went
to
sleep
again
some
hours
later
mayne
joined
kit
who
had
gone
on
deck
for
a
few
minutes
that
the
last
of
the
coffee
he
said
indicating
a
boat
alongside
the
peons
tell
me
the
next
lot
coming
down
but
if
we
ship
it
we
miss
the
tide
you
can
close
the
hatches
the
coffee
must
wait
it
stuff
and
brings
top
price
i
sure
do
like
to
leave
it
to
spoil
we
must
risk
that
kit
said
quietly
there
another
thing
pedro
the
clerk
reckons
they
fighting
near
salinas
and
the
president
not
popular
in
that
neighborhood
looks
as
if
you
might
have
some
trouble
to
take
the
old
man
to
the
mission
it
possible
said
kit
i
going
to
try
have
everything
ready
for
us
to
get
off
mayne
lifted
his
hand
to
his
cap
very
well
sir
we
start
as
soon
as
there
water
enough
he
went
away
but
kit
knew
what
he
meant
the
captain
had
done
his
duty
by
indicating
obstacles
but
he
approved
his
new
master
resolve
and
owned
his
authority
kit
was
persuaded
he
would
have
mayne
loyal
help
and
went
back
to
adam
room
when
it
was
getting
dark
adam
moved
his
head
as
the
engines
began
to
throb
and
the
propeller
churned
noisily
in
the
shallow
water
it
stopped
after
a
few
turns
and
steam
blew
off
finlay
giving
her
a
trial
spin
adam
remarked
in
a
very
faint
voice
i
see
you
got
things
fixed
and
i
ready
to
start
he
stopped
and
shut
his
eyes
for
a
minute
or
two
and
kit
did
not
know
if
he
was
conscious
or
not
then
he
resumed
in
a
strained
whisper
all
ready
ring
for
i
going
to
meet
my
wife
he
drew
a
hard
breath
sighed
and
did
not
speak
again
an
hour
afterwards
mayne
met
kit
coming
out
of
the
room
and
glancing
at
his
face
took
off
his
cap
i
guess
it
hits
you
hard
and
i
miss
him
too
he
said
i
not
get
another
master
like
the
buccaneer
he
went
off
to
give
some
orders
and
kit
sat
down
feeling
very
desolate
when
the
tide
had
risen
and
flowed
past
oily
smooth
under
the
full
moon
the
windlass
began
to
rattle
and
the
cable
clanged
the
anchor
came
up
and
when
the
engines
shook
the
ship
mayne
pulled
the
and
a
long
blast
rolled
across
the
woods
next
moment
a
rocket
soared
and
burst
in
a
shower
of
colored
lights
vanhuyten
and
askew
signal
the
head
of
the
house
is
making
his
last
trip
the
captain
remarked
the
echoes
sank
the
colored
lights
burned
out
and
the
measured
beat
of
engines
jarred
upon
the
silence
as
the
went
to
sea
for
a
time
the
land
breeze
blew
the
steam
of
the
swamps
after
her
and
masts
and
funnels
reeled
through
a
muggy
haze
as
she
lurched
across
the
shoals
she
floated
high
and
light
her
muddy
side
rising
like
a
wall
as
she
steadied
between
the
rolls
that
dipped
her
channels
in
the
foam
outside
the
swell
was
regular
and
the
roll
long
and
rhythmical
the
haze
thinned
the
air
got
sweet
and
cool
and
the
hearts
of
the
crew
got
lighter
as
she
steamed
out
to
open
sea
for
all
that
men
lowered
their
voices
and
trod
quietly
when
they
passed
the
poop
cabin
where
her
dead
owner
lay
at
sunrise
mayne
hoisted
the
and
the
stars
and
stripes
drooped
languidly
half
way
up
the
ensign
staff
until
the
glassy
calm
broke
and
the
sea
breeze
straightened
the
blue
and
silver
folds
by
and
by
he
changed
the
course
and
mountains
rose
ahead
although
a
bank
of
cloud
hid
the
plain
and
mangrove
forest
at
their
feet
in
the
afternoon
he
searched
the
haze
with
his
glasses
and
getting
a
bearing
stopped
the
engines
near
salinas
point
at
dusk
if
the
weather
good
i
wait
three
days
he
said
then
if
you
send
no
word
i
pull
out
for
havana
and
get
the
engines
properly
fixed
better
take
this
bag
of
spanish
money
minted
silver
goes
and
you
may
find
the
dagos
shy
of
the
president
notes
kit
took
the
money
a
boat
was
swung
out
and
four
sailors
carried
the
plain
coffin
down
the
ladder
they
were
rough
men
but
kit
imagined
he
could
trust
them
another
crew
picked
up
the
oars
greasy
caps
were
lifted
the
whistle
screamed
a
last
salute
and
the
boat
stole
away
mayne
steamed
off
to
anchor
on
good
holding
ground
and
kit
sat
at
the
tiller
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
misty
coast
it
was
dark
when
he
heard
breakers
and
saw
the
glimmer
of
surf
there
were
shoals
all
round
him
but
he
had
been
told
about
a
bay
where
a
creek
flowed
through
a
sheltered
channel
he
did
not
know
if
he
could
find
the
channel
and
if
not
the
boat
might
be
wrecked
but
something
must
be
left
to
luck
and
they
pulled
on
before
the
curling
swell
she
struck
and
stopped
until
a
comber
rolled
up
astern
it
broke
and
half
buried
her
in
rushing
foam
but
she
lifted
lurched
ahead
and
did
not
strike
again
the
men
were
nearly
as
they
baled
the
water
out
and
one
was
afterwards
idle
because
his
oar
had
gone
in
spite
of
this
they
made
the
creek
and
drifted
quietly
into
the
gloom
of
the
mangroves
with
the
flowing
tide
after
a
time
the
water
got
shallow
and
they
pushed
her
across
the
mud
while
leaves
and
rotting
branches
floated
up
the
creek
no
light
pierced
the
forest
and
the
feeble
beam
of
kit
lantern
scarcely
touched
the
shadowy
trunks
that
moved
past
until
they
came
to
an
opening
kit
thought
this
was
the
spot
he
had
been
told
about
and
turned
the
boat
she
would
not
float
to
the
bank
and
he
and
his
four
men
got
out
and
lifted
the
coffin
they
sank
in
treacherous
mud
but
reached
a
belt
of
sand
riddled
by
holes
all
was
very
quiet
except
for
the
ripple
of
the
tide
and
the
noise
made
by
the
scuttling
crabs
the
sand
however
was
dry
and
warm
and
they
sat
down
to
wait
for
morning
when
the
boat
went
away
chapter
x
the
road
to
the
mission
the
sun
was
high
when
kit
and
his
tired
men
reached
the
village
he
was
wet
with
sweat
and
the
moisture
that
had
dripped
upon
him
from
the
leaves
in
the
early
morning
and
the
men
gasped
when
they
put
down
their
load
two
wore
greasy
overalls
and
two
ragged
suits
of
duck
their
soft
hats
were
stained
and
battered
and
they
looked
like
ruffians
although
mayne
paid
good
wages
respectable
seamen
avoided
the
and
her
crew
were
as
a
rule
accustomed
to
fight
with
knives
and
sandbags
on
disorderly
now
they
carried
pistols
hidden
as
far
as
possible
but
ready
for
use
small
square
mud
houses
occupied
the
hole
in
the
forest
where
the
plaster
had
not
fallen
off
their
white
fronts
were
dazzling
but
they
were
dirty
and
ruinous
and
the
narrow
street
was
strewn
with
decaying
rubbish
although
the
had
once
prospered
under
spanish
rule
it
was
now
inhabited
by
languid
of
strangely
mixed
blood
engaged
in
smuggling
and
revolutionary
plots
they
stood
about
the
doorways
barefooted
and
ragged
watching
kit
with
furtive
black
eyes
i
want
porters
and
a
guide
to
the
mission
he
told
the
who
lounged
against
a
wall
smoking
a
cigar
it
is
a
long
way
señor
and
the
road
is
bad
besides
one
can
not
travel
when
the
sun
is
high
the
road
is
no
doubt
safer
then
than
in
the
dark
that
is
true
agreed
the
other
with
a
philosophic
shrug
the
country
is
disturbed
i
must
start
at
once
kit
said
firmly
i
am
willing
to
pay
for
the
risk
the
spoke
to
the
others
in
a
harsh
dialect
but
none
of
the
loafing
figures
moved
they
say
the
risk
is
great
he
remarked
there
has
been
fighting
and
the
president
soldiers
are
in
the
woods
the
president
soldiers
will
not
meddle
with
us
kit
answered
incautiously
for
a
moment
the
eyes
were
keen
but
his
dark
face
resumed
its
inscrutable
look
then
the
señor
is
a
friend
of
the
president
if
we
meet
his
soldiers
they
will
let
me
pass
the
soldiers
are
not
the
worst
there
are
the
men
without
shame
who
shoot
and
ask
no
questions
however
we
will
see
if
i
can
find
porters
if
the
señor
will
wait
until
the
afternoon
kit
distrusted
the
fellow
and
thought
he
had
an
object
for
putting
off
the
start
he
had
been
warned
that
the
sympathized
with
the
rebels
and
imagined
that
his
party
safety
depended
on
its
speed
but
he
did
not
want
to
look
impatient
and
imitating
the
carelessness
sat
down
and
lighted
a
cigarette
while
he
pondered
to
begin
with
he
suspected
that
the
would
prevent
his
meeting
any
of
the
president
soldiers
who
might
be
about
and
it
would
be
prudent
to
finish
his
business
and
get
back
to
the
ship
before
galdar
knew
he
was
in
the
woods
his
men
claimed
to
be
american
citizens
and
mayne
knew
where
he
had
gone
but
the
latter
statements
might
be
doubted
if
the
party
disappeared
it
was
known
that
askew
was
engaged
in
a
risky
trade
and
the
captain
story
would
look
more
romantic
than
plausible
kit
saw
he
must
depend
upon
his
own
resources
and
presently
noted
that
a
man
was
leaving
the
village
the
fellow
kept
behind
the
group
in
the
street
as
far
as
he
could
and
moved
quickly
there
was
something
stealthy
about
his
movements
and
when
he
looked
back
as
if
to
see
if
kit
were
watching
the
latter
got
up
stop
that
man
he
said
but
he
is
going
to
his
work
señor
the
objected
in
this
country
one
does
not
work
while
the
sun
is
high
said
kit
who
rather
ostentatiously
pulled
out
his
pistol
call
him
back
the
shouted
and
the
man
returned
but
kit
kept
his
pistol
in
his
hand
nobody
must
leave
the
until
i
start
he
said
i
want
porters
and
am
willing
to
pay
very
well
the
patron
agreed
shrugging
perhaps
i
can
find
a
few
men
but
they
will
want
the
money
before
they
go
for
a
time
kit
bargained
the
sailors
were
tired
and
few
white
men
are
capable
of
much
exertion
in
the
tropic
swamps
he
must
have
help
and
doubting
if
the
could
be
trusted
thought
it
best
to
offer
a
sum
that
would
excite
their
greed
but
stipulated
that
half
would
not
be
paid
until
they
returned
when
the
was
satisfied
kit
turned
to
the
sailors
you
have
to
hustle
boys
he
said
the
sooner
we
make
the
mission
the
sooner
we
get
back
and
i
reckon
nobody
wants
to
stop
in
these
swamps
there
something
beside
your
wages
coming
to
you
that
all
right
boss
one
replied
the
old
man
drove
hard
but
he
paid
well
and
he
was
white
you
can
go
ahead
we
put
the
job
over
the
peons
took
up
the
lashed
to
the
coffin
a
relief
party
went
behind
and
they
set
off
nobody
spoke
and
the
bare
feet
fell
silently
on
the
hot
sand
although
kit
heard
the
dragging
tramp
of
the
sailors
muddy
boots
in
the
open
space
round
the
village
the
sun
burned
their
skin
and
they
pushed
on
as
fast
as
possible
for
the
twilight
of
the
woods
here
and
there
a
bright
gleam
pierced
the
gloom
but
for
the
most
part
deep
shadow
filled
the
gaps
between
the
trunks
creepers
laced
the
great
cottonwoods
tangled
vines
crawled
about
their
tall
buttressed
roots
and
hung
in
festoons
from
the
giant
branches
some
of
the
trees
were
rotten
and
orchids
covered
their
decay
with
fantastic
bloom
the
forest
smelt
like
a
hothouse
but
the
smell
had
an
unwholesome
sourness
growth
ran
riot
green
things
shot
up
choked
each
other
and
sank
in
fermenting
corruption
kit
did
not
know
if
it
was
a
relief
to
escape
from
the
glare
of
the
clearing
or
not
the
sun
no
longer
burned
him
but
he
could
hardly
breathe
the
humid
air
and
effort
was
almost
impossible
all
the
same
he
pushed
on
floundering
in
muddy
pools
and
sinking
in
belts
of
mire
the
road
had
been
made
long
since
by
slave
labor
when
the
spaniards
ruled
and
had
fallen
into
ruin
like
the
country
when
their
yoke
was
broken
kit
could
trace
the
ancient
causeway
across
the
swamps
and
wondered
when
another
strong
race
would
put
their
stamp
on
the
land
the
descendants
of
the
conquerors
had
sunk
into
apathetic
sloth
the
blood
of
the
peoples
that
ran
in
their
veins
had
quenched
the
old
castilian
fire
when
the
light
was
fading
the
porters
declared
the
swamps
in
front
were
dangerous
and
put
down
their
load
and
after
some
trouble
the
white
men
lighted
a
fire
a
heavy
dew
began
to
drip
from
the
leaves
and
the
blaze
was
comforting
in
the
gloom
that
swiftly
settled
down
kit
had
brought
a
piece
of
tarpaulin
and
spread
it
between
the
roots
of
a
cottonwood
he
did
not
mean
to
go
to
sleep
but
his
head
ached
and
he
was
worn
out
by
physical
effort
and
anxious
watching
by
and
by
his
eyes
got
heavy
and
he
sank
down
in
a
corner
of
the
great
roots
the
fire
had
burned
low
when
he
looked
up
and
a
bright
beam
that
touched
a
neighboring
trunk
indicated
that
the
moon
was
high
all
was
very
quiet
but
for
the
splash
of
the
falling
dew
the
glade
was
a
little
brighter
and
rousing
himself
with
an
effort
he
glanced
about
he
saw
the
white
men
figures
stretched
in
ungainly
attitudes
on
a
piece
of
old
canvas
they
were
all
there
but
he
could
not
see
the
getting
up
he
walked
into
the
gloom
and
then
stopped
with
something
of
a
shock
there
was
nobody
about
for
a
few
moments
kit
thought
hard
to
begin
with
he
had
been
rash
to
pay
half
the
porters
wages
before
they
started
the
money
was
a
large
sum
for
them
and
they
had
stolen
away
perhaps
because
they
were
satisfied
and
afraid
of
meeting
the
president
soldiers
or
perhaps
to
betray
the
party
to
the
rebels
for
another
reward
if
the
latter
supposition
were
correct
kit
thought
he
ran
some
risk
galdar
friends
knew
he
could
not
be
bribed
and
that
adam
was
ill
although
it
was
hardly
possible
they
knew
he
was
dead
they
would
see
that
kit
had
now
control
and
since
his
help
was
valuable
to
the
president
might
try
to
kill
him
his
best
plan
was
to
push
on
he
wakened
the
sailors
who
grumbled
but
picked
up
the
coffin
when
he
tersely
explained
the
situation
wet
bushes
brushed
against
them
soaking
their
thin
clothes
trailers
caught
their
heads
and
the
road
got
wetter
and
rougher
until
they
came
to
a
creek
kit
could
not
tell
how
deep
it
was
the
forest
was
very
dark
and
only
a
faint
reflection
marked
the
water
we
must
get
across
boys
he
said
and
the
others
agreed
they
were
hard
men
but
the
dark
and
silence
weighed
them
down
and
excited
vague
superstitious
fears
it
was
a
gruesome
business
in
which
they
were
engaged
and
they
did
not
like
their
load
they
plunged
in
and
one
called
out
hoarsely
when
he
stumbled
and
the
lurching
coffin
struck
his
head
another
gasped
as
if
he
were
choking
while
he
struggled
to
balance
the
poles
the
current
rippled
round
their
legs
it
was
hard
to
pull
their
feet
out
of
the
mud
and
when
there
was
a
splash
in
the
dark
they
stopped
dripping
with
sweat
that
was
not
altogether
caused
by
effort
one
swore
at
the
others
in
a
breathless
voice
shove
on
you
slobs
he
said
the
old
man
getting
heavier
while
you
stop
i
want
to
dump
him
and
be
done
with
the
job
guess
had
enough
splashing
and
stumbling
they
went
forward
and
when
they
struggled
up
the
bank
kit
wiped
his
wet
face
for
a
moment
or
two
he
had
thought
the
men
would
drop
their
load
and
as
it
jolted
vague
and
black
on
their
shoulders
the
creaking
of
the
poles
had
jarred
his
nerves
he
was
going
to
keep
his
promise
but
he
sympathized
with
the
man
who
had
had
enough
after
they
left
the
creek
the
road
got
very
bad
and
in
places
vanished
in
belts
of
swamp
they
sank
in
mud
and
stagnant
water
and
no
light
pierced
the
daunting
gloom
but
it
was
not
hard
to
keep
the
proper
line
because
one
could
not
enter
the
jungle
without
a
cutlass
to
clear
a
path
at
length
when
the
men
were
exhausted
the
trees
got
thinner
and
the
moonlight
shining
through
touched
the
front
of
a
ruined
building
the
rest
was
indistinct
but
the
building
was
large
and
had
evidently
belonged
to
a
sugar
or
coffee
planter
the
sailors
stopped
and
kit
studied
a
gap
in
the
wall
the
gap
did
not
look
inviting
and
there
were
no
doubt
snakes
and
poisonous
spiders
inside
but
he
could
go
no
farther
and
the
broken
walls
offered
some
protection
perhaps
kit
was
moved
by
an
atavistic
fear
of
the
dark
forest
and
he
owned
that
he
was
influenced
by
the
civilized
man
longing
for
the
shelter
of
a
house
they
went
in
and
after
putting
down
the
coffin
in
a
room
where
vines
crawled
about
the
ruined
wall
the
sailors
entered
the
next
one
frankly
stated
that
they
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
coffin
kit
could
stop
and
watch
it
if
he
liked
but
it
bothered
them
to
have
the
thing
about
kit
let
them
go
and
sitting
down
in
a
corner
among
the
rubbish
lighted
a
cigar
a
moonbeam
rested
on
the
opposite
wall
and
the
room
was
not
dark
some
light
came
in
through
holes
although
there
was
impenetrable
gloom
beyond
the
door
by
which
the
men
had
gone
he
could
see
the
wet
leaves
of
the
vines
and
the
black
coffin
covered
by
the
flag
but
he
was
not
afraid
of
it
the
man
who
lay
there
had
been
his
friend
and
claimed
the
fulfilment
of
his
promise
at
the
same
time
it
was
soothing
to
hear
the
sailors
voices
until
they
got
faint
and
stopped
afterwards
the
silence
was
burdensome
although
a
small
creature
began
to
rustle
in
the
wall
kit
did
not
know
if
it
was
a
snake
or
a
spider
and
was
too
tired
to
feel
disturbed
by
and
by
his
cigar
fell
from
his
mouth
he
picked
it
up
but
it
fell
again
and
his
head
drooped
the
moonbeam
had
moved
some
distance
when
he
opened
his
eyes
and
straightened
his
body
with
a
jerk
the
room
was
nearly
dark
and
when
he
thought
about
it
afterwards
he
imagined
he
was
only
half
awake
for
his
heart
beat
and
he
was
conscious
of
an
enervating
fear
a
dark
object
indistinct
but
like
a
man
stood
beside
the
coffin
with
something
of
an
effort
kit
recovered
his
as
the
figure
turned
and
came
towards
him
it
moved
with
a
curious
stealthy
gait
making
no
noise
and
this
was
enough
for
kit
he
had
no
grounds
for
distrusting
the
sailors
and
they
wore
heavy
boots
trying
not
to
change
his
position
he
felt
for
his
automatic
pistol
the
butt
caught
a
fold
of
his
sash
and
he
was
forced
to
bend
his
elbow
in
order
to
get
it
out
it
looked
as
if
he
would
be
too
late
and
he
slipped
as
the
movement
dislodged
the
rubbish
on
which
he
sat
then
as
he
shrank
with
an
instinctive
quiver
from
the
prick
of
the
knife
the
figure
swerved
and
leaped
back
kit
threw
up
the
pistol
and
pulled
the
trigger
there
was
a
flash
that
dazzled
his
eyes
and
a
little
smoke
curled
up
but
when
he
leaned
forward
his
antagonist
had
gone
he
heard
no
movement
when
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
almost
imagined
he
had
been
dreaming
until
the
sailors
shouted
and
their
boots
rattled
on
the
broken
floor
they
ran
in
and
when
kit
told
them
what
had
happened
went
to
the
hole
in
the
wall
the
moonlight
touched
the
front
of
the
building
and
part
of
the
road
was
bright
but
the
shadow
of
the
forest
had
crept
across
the
rest
all
was
very
quiet
there
was
no
sound
in
the
gloom
then
a
flake
of
plaster
fell
close
behind
kit
head
and
a
sharp
report
rolled
across
the
trees
one
of
the
men
shot
at
a
venture
and
two
of
his
companions
ran
savagely
along
the
road
until
kit
called
them
back
come
in
he
said
when
they
returned
you
a
plain
mark
in
the
moonlight
and
ca
see
the
other
fellow
among
the
trees
looks
as
if
it
was
you
he
wanted
one
replied
well
i
guess
we
have
no
use
for
being
left
without
a
boss
and
since
we
do
like
our
camping
ground
you
have
got
to
come
with
us
we
draw
cuts
for
to
watch
kit
went
with
them
he
felt
shaken
for
the
man
who
had
brought
down
the
plaster
was
obviously
a
good
shot
he
imagined
it
was
another
who
had
intended
to
stab
him
in
fact
a
number
of
his
enemies
might
be
lurking
about
he
was
not
as
a
rule
vindictive
but
the
stealthy
attack
had
induced
a
dangerous
mood
and
he
was
sorry
he
had
missed
the
man
it
was
hard
to
see
why
he
had
done
so
but
he
had
perhaps
been
half
asleep
now
however
he
resolved
to
watch
until
day
broke
chapter
xi
kit
keeps
his
promise
it
was
getting
light
when
the
man
on
watch
called
kit
who
went
to
the
gap
in
the
wall
thin
mist
drifted
about
the
trees
and
trailed
across
the
road
there
was
some
open
ground
in
front
of
the
building
but
behind
this
the
forest
loomed
in
a
blurred
shadowy
mass
i
reckon
i
saw
something
move
where
the
fog
on
the
road
the
man
remarked
kit
saw
nothing
his
eyes
were
keen
for
he
had
searched
the
hillsides
for
sheep
but
it
looked
as
if
they
were
not
as
keen
as
the
sailor
and
standing
in
the
shadow
he
watched
the
indicated
spot
after
a
minute
or
two
a
figure
came
out
of
the
fog
and
signaled
with
a
lifted
hand
more
of
them
around
said
the
sailor
grimly
there
trouble
coming
to
them
if
they
mean
to
corral
us
jake
at
the
side
window
and
he
had
to
get
out
of
mobile
because
he
was
too
handy
with
his
gun
not
often
had
to
pull
mine
but
i
can
shoot
some
quit
talking
kit
rejoined
and
his
mouth
set
firm
when
the
figure
vanished
he
thought
the
rebels
meant
to
surround
the
building
if
so
they
were
probably
numerous
and
the
rifle
shot
some
hours
before
justified
the
supposition
they
had
first
tried
to
kill
him
quietly
and
finding
this
impossible
had
resolved
to
seize
the
party
well
there
was
good
cover
behind
the
broken
walls
his
men
were
a
reckless
lot
and
he
meant
to
fight
he
wished
the
others
would
begin
for
standing
in
the
dew
was
nervous
work
the
light
had
got
clearer
when
he
noted
a
movement
in
a
festoon
of
trailing
vines
the
wet
leaves
shook
as
if
somebody
were
cautiously
pulling
them
back
and
kit
stiffened
his
muscles
it
was
a
comfort
to
feel
his
hand
was
steady
and
although
he
had
not
used
a
pistol
much
he
was
a
good
shot
with
a
gun
he
thought
he
could
send
a
bullet
through
the
moving
leaves
but
wanted
his
lurking
enemy
to
begin
the
fight
a
face
appeared
at
an
opening
and
an
arm
pushed
through
the
man
was
coming
out
and
kit
felt
his
nerves
tingle
then
as
the
body
followed
his
arm
the
sailor
said
quietly
do
move
boss
i
fix
him
next
moment
kit
swung
round
for
the
man
who
stepped
out
into
the
road
wore
a
white
uniform
the
sailor
leaned
against
the
wall
to
steady
his
aim
and
his
tense
pose
and
rigid
hand
indicated
that
he
was
pressing
the
trigger
hold
on
kit
shouted
do
shoot
the
sailor
lowered
his
pistol
and
kit
springing
out
of
the
shadow
waved
his
hat
come
forward
we
are
friends
the
turned
and
called
to
somebody
and
then
joining
kit
glanced
at
the
sailor
pistol
with
a
dry
smile
it
looks
as
if
i
had
run
some
risk
you
did
not
mean
to
be
surprised
no
said
kit
one
takes
precautions
i
came
very
near
being
surprised
last
night
so
the
are
about
we
suspected
something
like
this
i
suppose
it
was
why
you
meant
to
search
the
but
did
you
see
us
the
indicated
a
plume
of
smoke
that
curled
up
from
behind
the
ruined
wall
we
saw
when
one
takes
precautions
it
is
prudent
to
see
they
are
complete
kit
nodded
there
was
no
use
in
getting
angry
his
men
were
rash
and
careless
but
to
some
extent
this
was
why
he
had
chosen
them
they
had
no
doubt
lighted
the
fire
to
cook
breakfast
where
is
your
companion
he
asked
there
are
three
of
us
you
will
see
the
others
in
a
few
moments
they
watch
the
road
farther
on
it
is
usual
for
us
to
patrol
in
twos
but
of
late
some
have
not
returned
a
revolution
is
a
bad
time
for
one
pays
old
reckonings
then
kit
smiled
i
imagine
it
would
have
been
bad
for
any
who
had
tried
to
steal
away
down
the
road
but
i
expect
you
know
me
we
have
orders
about
you
señor
you
see
a
servant
of
yours
the
answered
with
a
bow
but
it
might
be
better
if
you
told
us
your
plans
after
giving
him
a
cigarette
kit
sent
the
sailor
to
tell
the
others
and
when
the
came
up
offered
them
a
share
of
the
breakfast
his
men
had
cooked
while
they
ate
he
told
them
what
had
brought
him
there
and
where
he
was
going
so
the
american
is
dead
i
have
seen
him
at
the
presidio
one
remarked
well
señor
it
would
be
prudent
to
finish
your
business
at
salinas
after
that
i
do
not
know
there
has
been
fighting
and
some
of
the
president
soldiers
have
been
killed
in
the
swamps
i
must
finish
the
business
kit
replied
it
does
not
matter
what
happens
afterwards
the
nodded
the
american
talked
like
that
quick
and
short
but
what
he
said
went
however
we
will
go
to
salinas
with
you
when
you
are
ready
kit
got
up
and
gave
his
men
an
order
i
am
ready
now
they
set
off
soon
afterwards
and
reached
the
mission
as
the
light
was
fading
two
small
mud
buildings
and
a
little
church
stood
among
some
ruins
in
an
opening
and
a
frail
old
man
met
the
party
at
the
gate
he
took
off
his
hat
when
the
sailors
put
down
the
coffin
and
then
listened
to
kit
quiet
narrative
this
poor
place
is
yours
it
was
a
prosperous
mission
long
since
he
said
in
this
country
men
no
longer
build
but
plot
and
destroy
it
is
easier
than
the
other
now
we
will
put
the
coffin
in
the
church
and
then
i
will
give
you
food
father
herman
drew
back
an
old
leather
curtain
and
the
smell
of
incense
met
kit
as
he
stood
at
the
door
while
the
sailors
went
forward
with
their
load
the
church
was
nearly
dark
but
kit
saw
it
had
some
beauty
and
there
were
objects
that
hinted
at
more
prosperous
days
at
the
other
end
a
ruby
lamp
glimmered
and
a
wax
candle
burned
with
a
clear
flame
before
a
statue
of
the
virgin
kit
knew
whence
the
candle
came
and
that
hattie
askew
had
knelt
on
the
stones
beneath
it
praying
that
her
husband
might
get
well
then
he
looked
at
father
herman
with
a
doubt
in
his
mind
the
other
met
his
glance
and
smiled
the
greatest
of
these
is
charity
he
said
in
latin
and
resumed
in
fine
castilian
he
was
our
benefactor
a
man
who
kept
his
word
and
with
such
a
wife
i
think
our
faith
was
his
it
is
a
gracious
sentiment
that
they
should
not
be
parted
in
a
sense
kit
said
quietly
i
think
they
have
not
been
parted
yet
at
the
last
he
said
with
confidence
he
was
going
to
meet
his
wife
who
knows
said
father
herman
there
is
much
that
is
dark
but
one
felt
that
his
spirit
reached
out
after
hers
well
i
knew
he
would
come
back
i
have
long
expected
him
he
went
forward
and
lighted
more
candles
when
the
sailors
put
down
the
coffin
and
the
noise
their
boots
made
jarred
kit
nerves
as
they
came
back
the
light
spread
touching
the
bare
walls
and
tawdry
decorations
about
the
shrines
it
was
a
poor
little
church
falling
into
ruin
and
the
beauty
its
pious
builders
had
given
it
was
vanishing
yet
something
redeemed
it
from
being
commonplace
and
kit
felt
a
strange
emotional
stirring
as
his
eyes
rested
on
the
dim
ruby
lamp
and
the
rude
black
coffin
he
thought
the
light
of
love
could
not
be
quenched
and
knew
the
tender
romance
that
had
burned
in
the
heart
of
the
old
buccaneer
it
was
with
something
of
an
effort
he
turned
away
and
followed
father
herman
across
the
corral
two
hours
later
red
torches
flared
in
the
dark
as
they
laid
adam
in
his
grave
and
kit
worn
by
anxiety
and
physical
strain
listened
dully
to
the
solemn
latin
office
then
when
the
old
priest
voice
died
away
he
went
back
to
the
mission
where
he
fell
asleep
and
slept
twelve
hours
in
the
morning
he
sat
beneath
a
broken
arch
that
had
once
formed
part
of
a
cloister
outside
the
patch
of
shadow
the
sun
beat
upon
dazzling
sand
and
a
few
vivid
green
hung
over
a
ruined
wall
beyond
this
the
forest
rose
dark
and
forbidding
against
the
glaring
sky
although
the
rest
had
refreshed
kit
he
felt
as
if
he
had
got
older
in
the
last
few
days
and
now
the
strain
had
slackened
he
was
lonely
so
far
he
had
obeyed
orders
and
when
doubtful
looked
to
adam
for
a
lead
but
adam
had
gone
and
left
him
control
all
that
belonged
to
his
youth
had
vanished
he
was
a
man
with
a
man
responsibilities
and
a
man
problems
to
solve
presently
father
herman
came
up
and
sat
down
opposite
although
he
looked
feeble
his
glance
was
clear
and
kind
this
house
is
yours
señor
and
i
am
your
servant
he
said
yet
i
can
not
hope
that
you
will
remain
long
and
the
times
are
disturbed
if
i
can
help
since
the
rebels
know
i
am
here
it
would
not
be
safe
to
stay
but
i
can
not
reach
salinas
point
before
the
steamer
sails
kit
replied
i
must
get
to
havana
as
soon
as
possible
father
herman
thought
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
resumed
a
small
schooner
is
loading
at
a
beach
not
far
off
and
i
know
the
he
would
take
you
to
arenas
where
the
president
has
supporters
and
you
might
get
a
ship
i
think
he
sails
but
i
will
send
a
message
kit
thanked
him
and
went
on
you
were
my
uncle
friend
and
now
i
have
taken
his
place
you
are
mine
as
you
let
him
send
you
things
the
mission
needed
perhaps
you
will
not
refuse
me
i
had
not
hoped
for
this
father
herman
answered
with
a
grateful
look
the
generous
gifts
meant
much
to
us
for
we
are
very
poor
friendship
has
privileges
besides
it
was
my
uncle
wish
and
will
be
something
i
can
do
for
his
sake
father
herman
worn
face
got
very
soft
and
he
gave
kit
an
approving
glance
you
are
his
kinsman
señor
one
can
not
doubt
that
like
him
you
are
staunch
and
do
not
forget
but
in
some
ways
you
are
different
i
will
take
your
gifts
and
pray
that
yours
may
be
a
less
stormy
life
thank
you
kit
said
gently
and
went
off
to
look
after
his
men
in
the
afternoon
he
left
the
mission
and
a
week
later
reached
havana
where
he
found
a
cablegram
waiting
he
got
a
shock
when
he
opened
it
and
stood
for
a
time
with
the
message
crumpled
in
his
hand
for
it
told
him
that
peter
askew
was
dying
at
ashness
then
he
sat
down
on
the
long
arcaded
veranda
of
the
hotel
with
a
poignant
sense
of
loss
for
the
last
blow
was
heavier
than
the
first
it
would
be
too
late
when
he
got
home
andrew
his
english
relative
would
not
have
sent
the
message
had
there
been
any
hope
after
a
time
kit
began
to
pull
himself
together
he
felt
dull
and
half
stunned
but
saw
that
he
must
brace
up
although
one
duty
was
denied
him
another
was
left
he
could
not
bid
his
father
but
he
could
keep
his
promise
to
adam
and
there
was
much
to
be
done
getting
up
with
a
resolute
movement
he
went
to
the
telegraph
office
although
peter
had
not
hinted
that
he
was
ill
kit
felt
he
ought
to
have
gone
home
before
and
now
blamed
alvarez
for
keeping
him
he
knew
this
was
not
logical
but
he
hated
the
country
with
its
turmoils
and
plots
it
was
not
worth
helping
and
in
very
truth
he
did
not
know
if
by
supporting
the
president
he
were
helping
it
or
not
after
all
however
this
was
not
important
alvarez
needed
a
last
supply
of
munitions
that
adam
had
agreed
to
send
kit
doubted
if
they
would
be
paid
for
but
the
doubt
did
not
count
for
much
adam
knew
the
risk
when
he
agreed
and
his
engagements
bound
his
nephew
the
goods
must
be
delivered
and
then
kit
would
let
the
business
go
when
he
reached
the
office
he
wrote
a
cablegram
to
andrew
at
ashness
and
another
to
mayne
who
had
left
havana
before
kit
arrived
chapter
xii
the
last
cargo
dusk
was
falling
and
kit
urged
his
tired
mule
up
the
winding
road
his
skin
was
grimed
with
dust
for
he
had
ridden
hard
in
scorching
heat
and
was
anxious
and
impatient
to
get
on
the
was
in
the
lagoon
and
some
cargo
had
been
landed
but
kit
stopped
the
work
when
nobody
came
to
take
the
goods
it
looked
as
if
the
message
he
had
sent
through
a
secret
channel
had
not
reached
the
president
and
this
was
ominous
he
had
heard
rumors
of
fighting
when
he
was
in
cuba
and
the
united
states
but
the
newspapers
gave
him
little
information
and
he
had
driven
the
across
at
full
speed
in
order
to
finish
the
contract
before
the
revolution
spread
which
was
all
he
wanted
adam
staunch
loyalty
had
cost
him
his
life
but
the
president
had
no
claim
on
kit
besides
his
stopping
in
the
country
had
kept
him
away
from
ashness
when
he
was
needed
there
he
smiled
as
he
admitted
that
he
was
hardly
logical
since
he
was
stubbornly
pushing
on
when
almost
exhausted
in
order
that
alvarez
might
get
the
goods
he
required
but
after
all
this
was
for
adam
sake
as
he
rode
up
the
hill
the
sky
got
brighter
and
a
flickering
illumination
was
reflected
on
the
clouds
that
hung
about
the
mountains
it
looked
as
if
the
town
were
lighted
up
and
kit
wondered
whether
this
was
to
celebrate
a
victory
he
struck
the
mule
but
the
tired
animal
came
near
throwing
him
when
it
stumbled
and
he
let
it
choose
its
pace
the
jolt
had
shaken
him
and
he
was
very
tired
for
a
time
he
skirted
a
belt
of
trees
and
when
he
came
out
on
the
open
hillside
the
illumination
was
ominously
bright
now
he
was
getting
nearer
the
clouds
looked
different
from
the
mist
that
rolled
down
the
mountains
in
the
evening
they
were
dark
and
trailed
away
from
the
range
still
he
could
go
no
faster
and
he
waited
with
growing
anxiety
until
he
reached
a
narrow
tableland
it
commanded
a
wider
view
and
he
raised
himself
in
the
stirrups
as
he
saw
that
the
light
was
the
reflection
of
a
large
fire
he
sank
back
and
pulling
up
the
mule
let
the
bridle
fall
on
its
drooping
neck
it
looked
as
if
a
number
of
houses
were
burning
in
the
town
which
indicated
that
there
had
been
a
fight
the
trouble
was
he
did
not
know
who
had
won
and
this
was
important
if
the
president
were
badly
beaten
he
would
not
need
the
supplies
at
the
lagoon
although
they
might
be
useful
to
the
rebels
kit
imagined
it
would
be
prudent
to
turn
back
but
he
must
find
out
what
had
happened
and
sent
the
mule
forward
half
an
hour
afterwards
he
rode
into
the
town
the
small
square
houses
were
dark
and
there
was
nobody
in
the
narrow
street
but
he
heard
a
confused
uproar
farther
on
although
the
glare
in
the
sky
was
fainter
it
leaped
up
now
and
then
and
a
cloud
of
smoke
floated
across
the
roofs
a
red
glow
shone
down
the
next
street
and
he
saw
the
pavement
was
torn
up
broken
furniture
lay
among
piles
of
stones
the
walls
were
chipped
and
when
kit
got
down
he
had
some
trouble
to
lead
the
mule
across
the
ruined
barricade
although
he
saw
nobody
yet
the
shouts
that
came
from
the
neighborhood
of
the
presidio
were
ominous
kit
remounted
and
rode
slowly
up
to
the
edge
of
the
sandy
square
where
the
palms
grew
along
the
rails
the
square
was
occupied
by
an
excited
crowd
but
the
presidio
had
gone
a
great
pile
of
smoking
rubbish
and
a
wall
broken
by
wide
cracks
marked
where
it
had
stood
flames
played
about
the
ruin
and
kit
turned
his
mule
he
thought
the
crowd
was
waiting
to
search
for
plunder
and
did
not
expect
to
find
anybody
calm
enough
to
answer
his
questions
besides
he
needed
food
and
drink
and
might
learn
what
had
happened
at
the
café
the
small
tables
stretched
across
the
street
and
were
all
occupied
but
when
kit
had
tied
the
mule
to
the
alameda
railings
opposite
he
found
a
chair
and
ordered
an
omelette
and
wine
the
waiter
looked
at
him
with
some
surprise
and
kit
wondered
whether
it
was
prudent
for
him
to
stay
you
have
been
burning
the
presidio
he
remarked
we
have
got
rid
of
a
tyrant
the
waiter
replied
you
may
get
another
worse
said
kit
as
coolly
as
he
could
what
happened
to
the
president
somebody
shouted
and
when
the
waiter
went
away
kit
rested
his
arms
on
the
table
he
was
very
tired
and
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
come
too
late
since
the
president
was
overthrown
he
had
lost
a
large
sum
of
money
and
wasted
the
efforts
he
had
made
to
carry
out
adam
engagements
he
must
get
back
to
the
lagoon
as
soon
as
possible
but
he
needed
food
and
wanted
to
find
out
if
alvarez
had
escaped
there
was
however
some
risk
in
asking
questions
because
the
café
seemed
to
be
occupied
by
triumphant
rebels
presently
the
men
at
the
next
table
got
up
and
their
place
was
taken
by
another
group
among
which
kit
noted
francisca
sarmiento
and
her
relations
he
thought
they
looked
surprised
but
they
saluted
him
politely
and
soon
afterwards
the
girl
who
was
nearest
looked
round
you
have
courage
señor
she
remarked
in
a
meaning
tone
i
do
not
know
if
courage
is
needed
kit
replied
forcing
a
smile
it
looks
as
if
i
could
no
longer
meddle
with
politics
then
since
you
could
not
help
alvarez
why
did
you
come
i
imagined
i
could
help
him
until
i
saw
the
presidio
was
burnt
kit
replied
in
fact
i
have
found
out
what
has
happened
yet
the
girl
studied
him
with
some
curiosity
but
kit
felt
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
from
her
if
one
did
not
know
that
you
were
incorruptible
one
could
understand
your
rashness
she
said
in
a
mocking
tone
i
suppose
your
steamer
is
in
the
lagoon
kit
looked
round
the
café
was
crowded
but
the
people
were
talking
excitedly
and
nobody
seemed
to
notice
him
and
the
girl
the
noise
would
prevent
their
talk
being
heard
there
is
no
use
in
denying
it
because
galdar
spies
have
no
doubt
seen
her
i
would
be
glad
if
you
can
tell
me
what
has
become
of
the
president
francisca
gave
him
a
keen
glance
you
do
not
know
alvarez
is
dead
ah
said
kit
i
did
not
know
was
he
killed
he
died
soon
after
the
fighting
began
the
doctors
say
it
was
apoplexy
he
had
been
hurrying
about
in
the
burning
sun
i
wonder
he
was
a
strong
man
and
used
to
the
sun
francisca
smiled
one
does
not
ask
questions
at
a
time
like
this
it
is
prudent
to
believe
what
one
is
told
when
the
soldiers
lost
their
leader
they
ran
away
kit
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
he
had
had
a
faint
hope
that
the
president
might
rally
his
supporters
and
begin
the
fight
again
but
the
hope
was
gone
he
knew
all
he
wanted
and
must
leave
the
town
as
soon
as
he
had
had
some
food
alvarez
was
a
friend
of
mine
and
the
news
you
have
given
me
is
something
of
a
shock
he
said
i
think
the
country
will
feel
its
loss
but
that
is
not
my
business
and
since
there
is
nothing
to
keep
me
here
i
shall
be
glad
to
get
away
it
would
be
prudent
to
go
soon
francisca
remarked
in
a
low
voice
i
do
not
see
why
i
am
no
longer
important
enough
for
your
friends
to
meddle
with
me
you
are
very
modest
señor
if
you
are
not
rather
dull
you
have
goods
that
would
be
useful
to
the
new
president
who
has
a
rival
he
did
not
expect
don
felix
muñez
has
turned
traitor
and
there
are
people
who
support
him
in
the
coast
province
another
president
kit
exclaimed
with
a
soft
laugh
and
then
bowed
to
the
girl
i
think
you
mean
well
you
have
given
me
a
useful
hint
and
you
have
my
thanks
i
will
be
rash
and
tell
you
that
galdar
shall
not
have
the
goods
i
brought
franciscans
eyes
got
soft
and
a
touch
of
color
crept
into
her
olive
skin
one
does
not
often
meet
a
man
who
puts
honor
before
money
señor
i
wish
you
well
then
she
turned
to
her
companions
who
presently
left
the
table
and
soon
afterwards
kit
omelette
was
brought
while
he
ate
olsen
came
in
and
sitting
down
opposite
lighted
a
cigarette
you
allow
that
the
buccaneer
backed
the
wrong
man
he
said
i
warned
you
and
reckon
your
obstinacy
has
cost
you
something
that
is
so
kit
agreed
one
must
run
risks
in
a
business
like
this
but
i
do
expect
you
to
sympathize
olsen
smiled
i
do
pretend
i
not
satisfied
but
i
can
show
you
how
to
get
some
of
your
money
back
i
learned
much
about
you
and
askew
since
we
had
our
last
talk
and
am
willing
to
buy
part
of
the
cargo
you
seem
to
know
she
has
arrived
oh
yes
i
knew
some
hours
since
i
been
looking
out
for
you
to
whom
do
you
mean
to
sell
the
goods
kit
asked
does
that
matter
yes
it
rather
important
the
important
thing
is
you
get
paid
olsen
rejoined
kit
frowned
he
imagined
he
could
demand
a
high
price
and
now
alvarez
was
dead
there
was
perhaps
no
reason
for
refusing
to
bargain
but
he
did
not
mean
to
let
galdar
have
the
goods
he
thought
adam
would
not
have
done
so
and
he
held
the
new
president
to
some
extent
accountable
for
adam
last
illness
the
cargo
is
not
for
sale
he
said
oh
shucks
olsen
exclaimed
i
reckon
you
want
to
put
up
the
price
no
said
kit
rather
grimly
i
do
want
to
sell
do
be
a
fool
the
man
you
backed
is
dead
you
carried
out
your
contract
and
it
does
matter
to
him
now
who
gets
the
truck
that
true
kit
replied
but
i
wo
help
his
rival
olsen
looked
hard
at
him
and
saw
he
was
resolute
oh
well
if
determined
there
no
use
in
arguing
you
something
of
a
curiosity
i
have
met
a
man
like
you
before
he
went
away
and
kit
ordered
more
wine
for
he
was
thirsty
after
his
long
ride
and
had
borne
some
strain
he
had
to
wait
for
the
wine
but
had
expected
this
since
the
café
was
crowded
and
in
the
meantime
he
got
up
and
looked
across
the
street
nobody
had
meddled
with
the
mule
which
stood
quietly
by
the
railings
with
drooping
head
kit
wondered
where
he
could
get
it
some
food
and
if
he
could
hire
a
fresh
animal
then
a
waiter
brought
the
wine
and
when
he
had
drunk
some
and
lighted
a
cigarette
kit
listening
to
the
talk
of
the
men
at
the
next
table
got
a
hint
that
threw
some
light
on
olsen
offer
alvarez
had
used
the
vaults
under
the
presidio
for
a
munition
store
and
when
he
was
dead
the
had
blown
up
the
building
as
the
rebels
forced
their
way
in
now
there
was
a
new
president
in
the
field
it
was
obvious
why
galdar
wanted
fresh
supplies
this
however
was
not
important
and
kit
drained
his
glass
and
then
tried
to
rouse
himself
he
must
look
after
the
mule
and
if
it
was
not
fit
for
the
journey
get
another
animal
he
felt
strangely
reluctant
to
move
the
fatigue
he
had
for
a
time
shaken
off
returned
with
puzzling
suddenness
and
threatened
to
overpower
him
his
head
was
very
heavy
he
could
hardly
hear
the
people
talk
and
every
now
and
then
his
eyes
shut
he
could
not
keep
them
open
but
after
a
few
minutes
he
straightened
his
bent
shoulders
with
a
resolute
jerk
and
clenched
his
fist
it
was
not
fatigue
that
was
mastering
him
the
wine
was
drugged
he
had
not
noted
a
suspicious
taste
but
he
was
thirsty
and
the
omelette
was
strongly
flavored
with
garlic
and
red
pepper
holding
himself
stiffly
upright
he
tried
to
think
olsen
had
no
doubt
ordered
the
wine
to
be
drugged
and
his
object
was
plain
he
meant
to
prevent
kit
reaching
the
lagoon
until
he
had
removed
the
cargo
on
the
beach
and
tried
to
persuade
mayne
to
land
the
rest
well
the
plot
would
fail
and
with
an
effort
kit
got
up
and
crossed
the
street
he
suspected
that
he
was
watched
but
nobody
tried
to
stop
him
and
he
mounted
the
mule
the
animal
moved
off
at
a
better
pace
than
he
had
hoped
and
he
tried
to
brace
himself
his
head
ached
and
his
brain
was
very
dull
but
somehow
he
stuck
to
the
saddle
and
although
he
could
hardly
guide
the
mule
the
animal
avoided
the
people
in
its
way
after
a
time
the
street
became
empty
the
noise
behind
was
fainter
and
the
houses
were
dark
nobody
seemed
to
follow
him
and
kit
began
to
hope
he
might
be
able
to
leave
the
town
he
did
not
know
what
he
would
do
then
and
hardly
imagined
he
could
keep
up
the
effort
much
longer
perhaps
when
he
got
away
from
the
houses
he
could
tie
up
the
mule
in
a
quiet
place
and
rest
when
he
rode
down
a
rough
track
into
open
country
he
rocked
in
the
saddle
and
would
have
fallen
but
for
the
high
peak
and
big
stirrups
the
hillside
was
blurred
distorted
objects
that
he
thought
were
rocks
and
cactus
lurched
about
in
the
elusive
moonlight
and
the
sweat
ran
down
his
face
as
he
fought
against
the
drug
he
knew
it
would
conquer
him
but
he
was
going
on
as
long
as
possible
at
length
the
mule
stepped
into
a
hole
kit
foot
came
out
of
the
stirrup
and
he
fell
for
a
moment
or
two
the
mule
dragged
him
along
then
he
got
his
other
foot
loose
and
for
a
time
knew
nothing
more
the
moonlight
was
fading
when
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
that
he
was
lying
beside
a
clump
of
cactus
indistinct
objects
moved
along
the
road
not
far
off
and
he
heard
the
click
of
hoofs
on
stones
a
mule
train
was
passing
and
was
no
doubt
going
to
the
lagoon
he
could
not
get
up
and
was
glad
he
was
in
dark
shadow
the
muleteers
had
probably
been
told
to
look
out
for
him
and
a
blow
from
a
heavy
stone
would
prevent
his
interfering
with
the
rebels
plans
the
indistinct
figures
however
went
on
and
kit
relapsed
into
unconsciousness
it
was
daylight
when
he
wakened
and
saw
a
man
bending
over
him
kit
was
cold
and
wet
with
dew
his
head
ached
horribly
and
he
did
not
try
to
get
up
his
pistol
was
underneath
him
and
if
the
fellow
meant
to
kill
him
he
could
not
resist
what
do
you
want
he
asked
the
man
said
he
had
seen
him
lying
there
and
imagined
he
was
then
he
held
out
his
hand
and
asked
if
kit
could
get
up
kit
was
surprised
when
he
found
himself
on
his
feet
although
he
swayed
as
he
tried
to
keep
his
balance
i
suppose
you
are
a
liberator
he
said
dully
the
other
clenched
his
dark
fist
no
señor
those
dogs
the
are
no
friends
of
mine
but
you
were
for
the
president
it
was
known
in
the
town
kit
admitted
it
the
fellow
scornful
denial
was
comforting
and
after
some
talk
walking
with
a
painful
effort
he
went
with
him
down
the
hill
to
a
small
mud
house
a
few
minutes
after
he
got
there
he
went
to
sleep
but
in
the
meantime
the
man
had
promised
to
help
him
to
reach
the
lagoon
he
kept
his
promise
and
before
it
was
light
next
morning
kit
dismounted
on
the
sandy
beach
there
was
no
moon
and
mist
drifted
about
the
trees
but
the
water
shone
faintly
and
the
tide
was
nearly
full
the
steamer
loomed
in
the
gloom
and
when
kit
shouted
there
was
a
rattle
of
pulley
blocks
and
a
splash
of
oars
ten
minutes
afterwards
mayne
met
him
at
the
gangway
and
gave
him
his
hand
it
some
relief
to
see
you
back
he
said
finlay
has
his
fires
banked
and
can
get
steam
to
take
us
out
in
an
hour
or
two
kit
went
with
him
to
his
room
and
sat
down
limply
he
was
covered
with
dust
and
wet
with
dew
his
face
was
haggard
and
his
eyes
were
dull
i
tell
you
about
my
adventures
later
he
said
what
about
the
cargo
some
dagos
came
along
with
a
mule
train
and
loaded
up
part
of
the
truck
on
the
beach
they
had
an
order
that
looked
as
if
it
had
been
signed
by
you
and
as
they
were
a
pretty
tough
crowd
and
had
their
knives
loose
i
let
them
take
the
goods
when
i
studied
the
order
i
was
sure
about
the
hand
and
brought
off
all
they
had
left
by
and
by
another
gang
came
along
but
i
refused
to
send
a
boat
until
i
seen
you
you
were
prudent
kit
remarked
the
order
was
forged
let
me
see
the
mate
he
studied
the
book
mayne
gave
him
and
then
pondered
olsen
had
no
doubt
forged
the
order
and
kit
imagined
he
would
have
some
trouble
to
get
payment
for
the
goods
the
manufacturers
might
be
persuaded
to
take
back
the
rest
of
the
cargo
at
something
less
than
its
proper
price
but
kit
thought
the
value
of
the
munitions
supplied
to
alvarez
would
be
lost
the
new
president
would
certainly
try
to
disown
the
debt
kit
however
had
known
that
adam
staunchness
might
cost
him
much
and
something
might
perhaps
be
saved
he
had
had
enough
of
the
country
and
as
soon
as
he
could
straighten
out
the
tangle
in
which
the
revolution
had
involved
adam
business
he
was
going
back
to
ashness
heave
your
anchor
when
you
ready
he
said
to
mayne
we
call
at
havana
and
then
steam
for
new
orleans
at
he
stood
on
the
bridge
watching
the
mangroves
fade
into
the
mist
ahead
the
sun
was
rising
out
of
a
smooth
sea
the
air
was
fresh
and
kit
heart
was
lighter
he
had
done
with
plots
and
intrigue
and
was
going
back
to
ashness
and
the
quiet
hills
at
the
same
time
he
felt
a
tender
melancholy
as
he
thought
about
the
little
church
at
salinas
and
the
marble
cross
in
the
sandy
yard
then
he
lifted
his
head
and
the
melancholy
vanished
as
he
looked
across
the
sparkling
water
the
clang
of
engines
rose
and
fell
with
a
measured
beat
and
there
was
a
noisy
splashing
at
the
bows
bright
streaks
of
foam
eddied
about
the
side
and
a
long
smoke
cloud
trailed
astern
as
she
steamed
to
the
north
part

chapter
i
kit
welcome
kit
was
comfortably
tired
when
he
sat
down
by
the
beck
at
the
head
of
the
dale
he
had
been
at
ashness
for
a
week
and
finding
much
to
be
done
had
occupied
himself
with
characteristic
energy
it
was
a
relief
to
feel
that
the
heat
of
the
tropics
had
not
relaxed
his
muscles
as
much
as
he
had
thought
and
that
the
languidness
he
had
sometimes
fought
against
was
vanishing
before
the
bracing
winds
that
swept
his
native
hills
the
ache
in
his
arms
had
come
from
using
the
draining
spade
and
his
knees
were
stiff
after
a
long
walk
through
the
heather
to
examine
the
herdwick
sheep
his
vigor
was
coming
back
and
he
was
conscious
of
a
keen
but
tranquil
satisfaction
with
the
quiet
dale
filling
his
pipe
lazily
he
looked
about
the
sun
was
near
the
summit
of
the
fells
and
the
long
slopes
were
turning
gray
in
the
shadow
the
yellow
light
touched
the
other
side
of
the
valley
and
the
narrow
bottom
through
which
shining
water
ran
was
a
belt
of
cool
a
faint
bleating
of
sheep
came
down
the
hill
and
the
beck
splashed
softly
among
the
stones
kit
found
the
quiet
soothing
he
had
had
enough
excitement
and
adventure
and
had
recognized
that
the
life
he
had
led
in
the
tropics
was
not
for
him
on
the
whole
he
thought
he
had
made
good
one
did
one
best
at
the
work
one
found
but
intrigue
was
not
his
proper
job
for
all
that
he
did
not
mean
to
philosophize
and
had
something
to
think
about
when
he
sold
the
and
paid
his
debts
he
found
a
larger
surplus
than
he
had
hoped
moreover
his
agents
had
not
yet
enforced
all
business
claims
and
might
be
able
to
send
him
a
fresh
sum
the
money
he
brought
home
would
not
have
made
him
a
rich
man
in
america
but
it
would
go
a
long
way
in
the
dale
and
the
soil
and
flocks
at
ashness
could
be
improved
by
modern
methods
and
carefully
spent
capital
kit
had
begun
at
once
and
found
his
task
engrossing
but
when
the
day
work
was
over
he
felt
a
gentle
melancholy
and
a
sense
of
loneliness
adam
and
peter
had
gone
and
he
had
loved
them
both
he
knew
he
would
not
meet
their
like
again
yet
he
had
not
lost
them
altogether
they
had
so
to
speak
blazed
the
trail
for
him
and
he
must
try
to
follow
fronting
obstacles
with
their
fearless
calm
then
he
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
his
heart
beat
as
a
figure
came
round
a
bend
of
the
road
the
girl
was
some
distance
off
and
he
could
not
see
her
face
but
he
knew
her
and
braced
himself
he
had
known
the
meeting
must
come
and
much
depended
on
her
attitude
grace
was
no
longer
a
romantic
girl
and
though
he
had
not
forgotten
her
she
might
have
been
persuaded
that
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
now
she
must
choose
her
line
and
he
sat
still
half
prepared
for
her
to
pass
him
with
a
bow
while
he
waited
his
dog
got
up
and
ran
along
the
road
old
bob
knew
grace
and
it
looked
as
if
she
had
spoken
to
and
perhaps
petted
him
while
his
master
was
away
she
stopped
and
kit
felt
ashamed
when
he
got
up
for
she
gave
him
her
hand
with
a
friendly
look
and
he
saw
she
had
not
changed
as
much
as
he
had
thought
the
proud
calm
he
approved
was
perhaps
more
marked
but
he
imagined
the
generous
rashness
he
had
liked
as
well
still
lurked
beneath
the
surface
he
had
met
attractive
girls
in
the
tropics
who
knew
they
were
beautiful
and
added
by
art
to
their
physical
charm
grace
however
used
hers
unconsciously
he
thought
she
was
too
proud
to
care
if
she
had
such
charm
or
not
i
am
glad
to
see
you
back
she
said
and
stroked
the
dog
that
leaped
upon
her
bob
and
i
are
friends
he
knew
me
when
i
came
round
the
corner
so
did
i
kit
rejoined
quietly
he
thought
he
noted
a
touch
of
color
in
her
face
but
she
smiled
you
did
not
get
up
perhaps
you
were
not
sure
like
bob
i
think
i
was
sure
but
i
have
been
away
some
time
and
it
was
not
my
part
to
force
you
to
acknowledge
me
if
i
did
want
to
grace
suggested
well
i
do
not
forget
my
friends
and
now
if
you
are
satisfied
we
can
let
that
go
she
paused
and
resumed
when
he
went
on
with
her
the
dalesfolk
have
missed
you
particularly
since
your
father
died
it
must
have
been
a
shock
i
felt
it
too
because
i
saw
him
now
and
then
we
were
friends
in
spite
of
all
kit
was
grateful
for
her
frank
sympathy
and
felt
he
could
talk
to
her
about
his
father
he
did
not
tell
me
this
but
he
liked
you
he
was
just
grace
replied
people
knew
and
trusted
him
he
had
none
of
the
rancor
that
often
leads
us
wrong
when
he
was
firm
he
did
not
get
angry
that
kind
of
attitude
is
hard
but
it
makes
things
easier
but
you
were
in
america
with
his
brother
were
you
not
i
was
in
the
united
states
and
afterwards
in
some
of
the
countries
on
the
caribbean
ah
said
grace
with
curiosity
that
must
have
been
interesting
one
understands
that
is
a
beautiful
and
romantic
coast
with
its
memories
of
the
great
elizabethan
sailors
and
the
pirates
it
is
romantic
and
dangerous
in
parts
you
can
land
at
some
of
the
towns
from
modern
and
find
smart
shops
and
cafés
others
have
fallen
into
ruin
and
lie
by
the
forest
beside
lagoons
you
steal
in
through
the
mist
at
the
top
of
a
high
tide
much
as
the
old
pirates
did
and
when
you
land
find
hints
of
a
vanished
civilization
and
the
spaniards
broken
power
but
you
seem
to
know
something
about
the
coast
grace
smiled
you
look
surprised
there
is
a
library
at
tarnside
although
it
is
not
often
used
and
we
have
books
about
the
voyages
of
the
buccaneers
one
book
is
rather
fascinating
but
what
were
you
doing
in
the
lagoons
sometimes
we
loaded
dyewoods
and
rubber
sometimes
we
lent
money
to
ambitious
politicians
in
return
for
unlawful
trading
privileges
and
now
and
then
engaged
in
business
that
was
something
like
that
of
the
old
adventurers
after
that
you
must
find
the
dale
very
tame
grace
remarked
and
quietly
studied
kit
she
had
liked
his
honesty
and
resolution
before
he
went
abroad
but
he
had
gained
something
she
had
not
noted
then
although
he
wore
rough
working
clothes
and
had
obviously
been
digging
he
had
an
elusive
touch
of
distinction
and
there
was
a
hint
of
command
in
his
quiet
look
he
had
seen
the
world
confronted
dangers
and
used
power
and
this
had
put
a
stamp
on
him
it
is
hard
to
imagine
you
a
pirate
she
remarked
with
a
twinkle
you
do
look
the
part
and
no
doubt
like
other
occupations
it
requires
some
study
kit
laughed
one
does
the
best
one
can
i
rather
think
taking
trouble
and
a
determination
to
make
good
are
as
useful
as
specialized
training
perhaps
that
true
it
curious
in
a
way
but
i
expect
a
good
farmer
for
example
might
make
a
successful
buccaneer
one
understands
though
that
the
last
pirate
was
hanged
a
hundred
years
since
there
are
a
few
left
although
their
methods
have
changed
with
the
times
some
day
i
would
like
to
tell
you
about
my
uncle
he
was
so
to
speak
a
survival
and
i
think
you
would
appreciate
him
but
how
have
things
been
going
in
the
dale
grace
twinkle
vanished
her
look
became
serious
and
kit
thought
he
noted
signs
of
strain
after
all
she
had
changed
since
he
left
ashness
it
was
not
that
she
looked
older
although
she
was
now
a
rather
stately
woman
and
not
an
impulsive
girl
he
felt
that
she
had
known
care
on
the
whole
she
said
things
have
not
gone
very
well
we
have
had
wet
summers
and
heavy
snow
in
spring
the
flocks
are
poor
and
rents
have
come
down
bell
has
gone
he
quarreled
with
hayes
about
some
new
machinery
for
the
mill
all
is
much
the
same
at
tarnside
though
my
father
is
not
so
active
gerald
left
woolwich
perhaps
you
knew
and
is
in
a
london
bank
kit
hid
his
surprise
gerald
was
not
the
stuff
of
which
good
bank
clerks
are
made
although
osborn
influence
with
the
local
manager
had
no
doubt
got
him
the
post
kit
imagined
the
lad
had
been
forced
to
leave
woolwich
but
money
must
be
scarce
at
tarnside
since
he
had
gone
into
business
this
threw
some
light
on
the
hint
of
weariness
he
had
noted
about
grace
if
fresh
economy
was
needful
she
and
osborn
must
carry
the
load
hayes
is
still
your
agent
i
met
him
yesterday
and
he
gave
me
a
sour
nod
kit
remarked
yes
said
grace
and
added
quietly
i
sometimes
wish
he
were
not
well
i
never
liked
the
man
all
the
same
he
a
very
good
agent
from
the
landlord
point
of
view
and
your
father
interests
ought
to
be
safe
with
him
i
suppose
so
grace
agreed
but
her
look
was
doubtful
and
they
reached
the
ashness
lonning
a
few
minutes
later
when
kit
stopped
she
gave
him
her
hand
i
hear
you
are
going
to
make
a
number
of
improvements
and
wish
you
good
luck
kit
went
up
the
lonning
and
sitting
down
in
the
porch
lighted
his
pipe
grace
had
not
forgotten
she
had
given
him
his
real
welcome
home
and
he
thrilled
as
he
thought
about
her
quiet
friendliness
perhaps
the
meeting
was
awkward
for
her
but
she
had
struck
the
right
note
with
the
dignified
simplicity
he
had
expected
it
said
something
for
her
pluck
that
she
had
met
him
as
if
the
interview
at
ashness
when
osborn
had
driven
him
away
had
never
taken
place
all
this
was
comforting
but
kit
was
vaguely
disturbed
on
her
account
he
had
noted
a
hint
of
anxiety
and
she
had
implied
that
things
were
not
going
well
for
the
osborns
he
meant
to
marry
grace
his
longing
for
her
was
keener
than
he
had
felt
it
yet
but
it
was
not
altogether
selfish
she
must
be
removed
from
surroundings
in
which
she
could
not
thrive
tarnside
with
its
rash
extravagance
pretense
and
stern
private
economy
was
not
the
place
for
her
but
he
felt
he
must
be
patient
and
cautious
there
were
numerous
obstacles
in
his
way
in
the
meantime
grace
met
thorn
farther
along
the
road
and
tried
to
hide
her
annoyance
as
he
advanced
perhaps
it
was
the
contrast
between
him
and
kit
whose
thin
brown
face
had
a
look
for
alan
was
fat
and
getting
coarse
grace
had
noted
this
before
but
not
so
plainly
as
she
did
now
his
manners
were
urbane
and
he
belonged
to
her
circle
to
some
extent
his
code
was
hers
and
she
had
his
prejudices
and
tastes
all
the
same
she
did
not
like
him
for
one
thing
he
was
a
type
her
father
approved
a
man
of
local
importance
and
strictly
local
ideas
and
osborn
had
forced
her
into
rebellion
alan
managed
the
otter
hounds
well
and
knew
much
about
farming
but
he
was
satisfied
with
this
although
he
belonged
to
a
smart
london
club
grace
imagined
he
only
went
there
because
he
thought
he
ought
yet
he
was
cunning
and
patient
and
knowing
why
he
bore
with
osborn
she
was
sometimes
afraid
was
that
askew
he
inquired
when
he
turned
and
went
on
with
her
grace
said
it
was
and
he
gave
her
a
careless
look
i
heard
he
had
come
back
might
have
been
better
if
he
had
stayed
away
a
fellow
like
that
is
rather
disturbing
i
do
think
he
could
do
much
harm
when
you
and
hayes
are
on
your
guard
grace
rejoined
that
is
so
thorn
agreed
and
she
could
not
tell
if
he
knew
she
had
meant
to
be
ironical
anyhow
i
do
suppose
he
wants
to
do
much
harm
i
was
thinking
about
his
example
is
it
a
dangerous
example
to
improve
one
land
i
thought
you
advocated
scientific
farming
so
i
do
i
do
mean
that
although
i
do
know
if
askew
farming
is
scientific
or
not
one
ca
judge
yet
his
independence
and
habit
of
taking
his
own
line
might
be
dangerous
askew
independence
is
justified
ashness
is
his
yes
said
thorn
thoughtfully
that
the
trouble
if
he
was
a
farming
tenant
things
would
be
easier
grace
laughed
you
are
delightfully
naïve
i
afraid
you
have
to
leave
askew
alone
but
i
do
expect
he
do
anything
alarming
i
think
you
know
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
i
knew
he
was
before
he
went
abroad
if
you
have
renewed
the
friendship
it
means
you
satisfied
about
him
and
perhaps
we
need
be
disturbed
your
judgment
is
generally
sound
thank
you
said
grace
i
have
relations
who
would
not
agree
but
why
do
you
dislike
people
who
take
their
own
line
it
would
be
awkward
if
one
tenants
did
so
but
perhaps
my
feeling
springs
from
envy
the
rest
of
us
ca
do
what
we
want
you
ca
for
example
grace
gave
him
a
keen
glance
and
then
laughed
on
the
whole
that
is
true
we
have
a
number
of
rules
at
tarnside
but
one
now
and
then
gets
some
satisfaction
from
breaking
them
rebellion
does
pay
thorn
rejoined
with
a
touch
of
dry
humor
you
are
young
and
adventurous
but
you
find
it
prudent
so
to
speak
to
accept
your
environment
and
submit
some
people
call
submission
duty
but
that
really
cant
they
mean
it
saves
them
trouble
anyhow
you
can
not
make
your
own
code
when
you
born
at
a
place
like
tarnside
it
made
for
you
ah
said
grace
i
wonder
well
you
know
i
am
sometimes
rash
then
she
was
careful
to
talk
about
something
else
for
she
thought
alan
had
not
philosophized
without
an
object
and
it
was
not
difficult
to
see
where
his
hints
led
when
they
reached
the
lodge
she
firmly
sent
him
away
although
he
looked
as
if
he
wanted
to
come
to
the
house
chapter
ii
a
dangerous
talent
dinner
was
nearly
over
at
tarnside
the
meal
was
served
with
some
ceremony
although
the
bill
of
fare
was
frugal
except
when
game
could
be
shot
and
as
a
rule
nobody
but
osborn
talked
much
now
he
had
satisfied
his
appetite
he
looked
about
the
spacious
room
the
handsome
molded
ceiling
was
dark
from
neglect
and
the
cornice
was
stained
by
damp
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
streamed
in
through
the
long
casement
window
which
commanded
the
shining
tarn
and
the
woods
that
melted
into
shadow
at
the
mouth
of
the
dale
it
was
a
noble
view
but
it
did
not
hold
eyes
for
the
quivering
sunbeams
searched
out
the
faded
spots
on
the
curtains
and
the
worn
patches
on
the
rugs
on
the
polished
floor
we
need
a
number
of
new
things
and
i
do
know
how
they
to
be
got
he
remarked
and
when
osborn
said
nothing
knitted
his
brows
he
had
put
away
some
money
for
renovations
but
it
had
gone
one
could
not
keep
money
at
tarnside
it
vanished
and
left
nothing
to
show
how
it
had
been
spent
i
understand
young
askew
is
back
at
ashness
he
resumed
looking
hard
at
grace
yes
said
grace
i
met
him
not
long
since
osborn
frowned
he
knew
she
had
met
kit
but
did
not
know
if
he
liked
her
candor
the
girl
was
independent
but
he
thought
she
now
understood
the
responsibilities
of
her
rank
the
fellow
is
obviously
prosperous
since
he
spending
a
large
sum
on
draining
i
saw
a
big
stack
of
pipes
and
a
number
of
men
at
work
my
opinion
is
it
a
ridiculous
waste
of
money
perhaps
there
are
worse
extravagances
grace
rejoined
i
expect
he
has
some
hope
of
getting
his
money
back
by
growing
better
crops
ours
goes
and
never
returns
osborn
gave
her
a
warning
glance
osborn
hated
contradiction
and
grace
and
he
often
jarred
but
the
girl
smiled
father
and
i
are
not
going
to
quarrel
about
askew
farming
it
is
not
worth
while
she
said
and
studied
osborn
with
sympathy
the
strong
light
touched
his
face
forcing
up
the
deep
lines
and
wrinkles
and
she
thought
he
was
getting
older
fast
his
eyes
were
dull
and
his
shoulders
were
slightly
bent
she
knew
about
some
of
his
troubles
and
suspected
others
but
the
stamp
of
indulgence
that
had
got
plainer
in
the
last
year
or
two
disturbed
her
the
askews
seem
fated
to
give
me
trouble
he
went
on
now
the
fellow
has
begun
to
drain
his
neighbors
will
expect
me
to
do
so
in
fact
black
and
pattinson
bothered
hayes
about
some
plans
for
buying
pipes
when
they
paid
their
rent
besides
the
contrast
hurts
i
do
see
why
a
fellow
like
askew
should
be
able
to
waste
money
on
rash
experiments
when
we
have
not
enough
however
this
leads
to
another
matter
gerald
comes
back
tomorrow
and
will
no
doubt
grumble
about
his
poverty
if
he
does
you
must
give
him
nothing
he
has
his
pay
and
i
make
him
an
allowance
i
wo
have
his
extravagance
encouraged
grace
smiled
as
osborn
got
up
with
a
disturbed
look
mother
can
not
have
much
to
give
and
i
have
nothing
at
all
i
afraid
gerald
talent
for
begging
will
be
used
in
vain
she
went
out
with
osborn
and
when
they
had
gone
osborn
crossing
the
floor
to
the
sideboard
filled
his
glass
to
the
top
this
was
his
regular
habit
and
its
futility
escaped
him
although
he
knew
his
wife
and
daughter
knew
he
felt
he
did
enough
if
he
exercised
some
when
they
were
about
in
the
meantime
osborn
sat
down
on
the
terrace
and
looked
across
the
untidy
lawn
we
need
a
new
pony
mower
jenkins
can
not
keep
the
grass
in
order
with
the
small
machine
he
was
very
obstinate
about
the
bedding
plants
he
wanted
to
buy
and
the
borders
look
thin
but
i
felt
i
must
be
firm
she
said
and
added
drearily
i
wonder
when
we
shall
be
forced
to
get
a
sporting
tenant
and
live
in
a
smaller
house
father
would
not
leave
tarnside
i
suppose
you
do
know
how
things
are
really
going
i
know
they
are
not
going
well
and
suspect
they
get
worse
but
he
will
not
tell
me
one
could
help
if
one
did
know
i
afraid
i
have
disappointed
father
and
given
you
anxieties
you
need
not
have
had
grace
replied
with
some
bitterness
after
all
however
the
fault
is
hardly
mine
i
wanted
to
make
my
own
career
but
was
not
allowed
to
work
at
a
useful
occupation
would
somehow
have
humiliated
our
ridiculous
pride
and
there
was
of
course
only
one
hope
left
for
you
she
paused
and
colored
as
she
resumed
well
although
i
am
not
sorry
it
looks
as
if
that
hope
had
gone
it
would
have
been
a
relief
if
you
had
made
a
good
marriage
osborn
admitted
still
since
you
met
nobody
you
like
the
men
i
might
perhaps
have
liked
were
poor
father
would
no
doubt
think
it
my
natural
perversity
or
our
bad
luck
but
i
do
believe
in
luck
it
an
excuse
for
weak
makeshifts
and
futilities
one
can
conquer
bad
fortune
if
one
is
resolute
none
of
us
except
you
has
much
resolution
osborn
remarked
and
sighed
so
far
your
firmness
has
not
helped
much
i
imagine
you
know
your
father
has
not
given
up
hope
yes
said
grace
rather
harshly
i
do
know
and
that
is
why
i
am
often
impatient
he
will
not
be
persuaded
the
thing
impossible
after
all
alan
has
some
advantages
he
has
many
drawbacks
grace
rejoined
and
then
her
face
softened
and
she
gave
her
mother
an
appealing
look
i
thought
you
were
on
my
side
i
am
on
your
side
where
you
feel
strongly
perhaps
i
am
reserved
and
you
do
not
often
give
me
your
confidence
i
sorry
we
are
seldom
quite
honest
at
tarnside
somehow
one
ca
be
oneself
but
now
we
must
be
frank
i
do
like
alan
thorn
i
never
liked
him
it
impossible
then
my
dear
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
grace
made
a
sign
of
disagreement
there
may
be
much
that
is
why
i
am
disturbed
you
and
i
do
count
mother
we
are
expected
to
submit
it
is
that
i
do
like
alan
i
shrink
from
him
he
is
cunning
and
knows
how
to
wait
sometimes
his
patience
frightens
me
but
why
should
his
patience
frighten
you
oh
said
grace
ca
you
understand
you
know
father
habits
and
that
gerald
is
following
him
you
know
our
debts
are
mounting
up
and
this
ca
go
on
some
day
we
may
be
ruined
and
then
i
think
alan
will
seize
his
chance
perhaps
i
imaginative
but
such
things
happen
osborn
put
her
hand
on
the
girl
arm
and
her
touch
was
unusually
firm
you
may
be
alarmed
for
nothing
my
dear
but
if
the
time
should
come
when
my
help
is
really
needed
it
will
be
yours
grace
kissed
her
i
can
trust
you
i
was
weak
i
sometimes
a
coward
but
now
i
comforted
they
were
silent
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
osborn
looked
up
is
it
prudent
for
you
to
meet
christopher
askew
again
grace
colored
but
met
her
mother
glance
and
answered
with
a
thoughtful
calm
i
see
no
danger
i
liked
kit
before
he
went
away
but
our
friendship
was
really
not
romantic
when
father
met
us
in
redmire
wood
a
horribly
silly
impulse
made
me
hide
i
blush
when
i
think
about
it
and
imagine
i
forgot
i
had
grown
up
gerald
and
i
used
to
hide
when
father
was
angry
anyhow
i
made
kit
askew
hide
and
he
was
first
to
remember
and
step
into
the
road
but
this
happened
long
since
and
he
is
older
yes
said
grace
he
different
although
one
feels
that
he
has
kept
a
promise
made
in
his
stage
he
has
been
out
in
the
world
and
done
strenuous
things
while
i
stayed
at
home
and
played
at
he
talks
like
a
man
who
knows
his
value
and
there
a
touch
of
distinction
in
his
look
a
stupid
word
but
it
comes
near
what
i
mean
osborn
glanced
at
her
sharply
but
grace
smiled
do
be
disturbed
mother
i
am
trying
to
tell
you
all
i
think
we
were
friends
but
i
imagine
kit
knows
his
drawbacks
from
our
point
of
view
besides
after
father
quarreled
with
peter
askew
i
never
sent
kit
a
message
and
he
must
have
thought
i
acquiesced
in
a
way
i
did
acquiesce
it
was
the
best
thing
to
be
done
you
see
what
this
implied
if
i
had
loved
him
it
meant
i
had
no
pluck
and
was
ashamed
to
acknowledge
a
farmer
son
but
he
knew
i
did
not
love
him
and
understood
that
our
friendship
would
not
bear
the
strain
of
father
disapproval
either
way
it
hinted
that
i
was
weak
and
not
worth
pursuing
well
he
met
me
without
embarrassment
and
we
talked
about
nothing
important
i
may
meet
him
now
and
then
but
that
i
think
is
all
very
well
said
osborn
who
looked
relieved
perhaps
it
would
be
prudent
not
to
meet
him
often
grace
smiled
and
was
silent
for
a
time
she
had
tried
to
be
frank
and
thought
she
had
stated
things
correctly
so
far
as
she
knew
then
she
remembered
kit
look
when
she
stopped
and
spoke
and
began
to
wonder
perhaps
she
had
not
told
all
and
the
little
she
had
left
out
was
important
by
and
by
she
got
up
and
went
into
the
house
gerald
osborn
came
home
next
day
and
not
long
afterwards
kit
found
him
lying
on
the
gravel
beside
a
tarn
on
the
ashness
moor
heavy
rain
had
fallen
but
the
clouds
had
rolled
away
and
the
water
shone
with
dazzling
light
the
sky
was
clear
except
for
a
bank
of
mist
floating
about
the
round
top
of
a
fell
and
a
swollen
beck
sparkled
among
the
heather
the
wind
had
dropped
and
it
was
very
hot
when
he
heard
kit
steps
gerald
looked
up
he
was
a
handsome
young
man
with
some
charm
of
manner
although
it
was
obvious
now
and
then
that
he
had
inherited
a
touch
of
his
father
pride
his
glance
was
keen
and
intelligent
but
his
mouth
and
chin
were
weak
gerald
had
talent
but
was
very
like
osborn
since
he
was
sometimes
rashly
obstinate
and
sometimes
vacillating
hallo
he
said
i
expect
i
ought
to
have
asked
your
leave
before
i
came
to
fish
i
hope
you
do
mind
i
do
mind
nobody
asks
my
leave
kit
replied
have
you
had
much
luck
gerald
opened
his
creel
and
showed
him
a
number
of
small
trout
pretty
good
they
rose
well
until
the
light
got
strong
then
i
thought
i
take
a
rest
will
you
smoke
a
cigarette
kit
sat
down
and
looked
across
the
shining
water
at
the
silver
that
gleamed
among
vivid
green
moss
on
the
side
of
the
hill
you
must
find
this
a
pleasant
change
from
town
are
you
staying
long
a
fortnight
that
all
i
get
i
wish
i
could
stop
for
good
it
rot
to
spend
one
life
working
in
a
bank
i
suppose
one
must
work
at
something
kit
remarked
i
do
see
why
unless
you
forced
the
only
object
for
working
is
when
you
must
work
to
live
and
it
is
mine
because
i
ca
live
on
my
pay
in
fact
the
futility
of
the
thing
is
plain
kit
laughed
gerald
humorous
candor
was
part
of
his
charm
but
kit
thought
it
deceptive
why
did
you
go
to
the
bank
then
because
my
father
thought
i
ought
i
expect
you
know
he
believes
in
the
firm
hand
i
wanted
to
stop
at
tarnside
which
would
have
cost
him
less
besides
i
could
have
looked
after
the
estate
it
will
be
mine
sometime
that
is
as
much
as
is
left
but
hayes
transacts
the
business
just
so
said
gerald
rather
dryly
what
do
you
think
about
hayes
he
your
father
agent
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
i
imagine
he
a
capable
manager
i
sometimes
think
he
too
capable
gerald
rejoined
kit
let
this
go
before
he
went
away
he
had
suspected
that
hayes
had
plans
his
employer
would
not
approve
and
he
knew
gerald
was
shrewd
it
was
however
not
his
business
and
he
remarked
you
wanted
to
go
to
woolwich
did
you
i
did
not
gerald
declared
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
said
so
but
my
objections
did
count
i
might
have
made
a
good
farmer
or
but
a
number
of
us
had
been
soldiers
and
that
was
enough
i
do
know
if
it
was
a
logical
argument
but
i
had
to
go
and
on
the
whole
it
was
a
relief
when
they
turned
me
out
too
many
regulations
for
my
independent
taste
rules
are
good
perhaps
so
long
as
they
made
for
somebody
else
he
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
and
kit
mused
he
thought
there
was
some
bitterness
in
gerald
humor
it
looked
as
if
osborn
had
not
been
wise
when
he
planned
his
son
career
without
consulting
him
this
however
was
typical
osborn
was
satisfied
to
give
orders
and
expected
others
to
accept
his
point
of
view
well
said
gerald
getting
up
i
must
be
off
rather
a
bore
to
walk
to
tarnside
and
the
trout
will
probably
rise
again
if
there
wind
enough
to
make
a
ripple
but
i
forgot
to
ask
for
sandwiches
if
you
lunch
with
me
you
could
come
back
afterwards
kit
suggested
and
they
set
off
down
the
hill
when
they
reached
ashness
gerald
tried
to
hide
his
surprise
kit
had
made
some
changes
in
the
old
house
and
so
far
kept
to
the
spanish
rule
of
meals
lunch
was
a
late
breakfast
well
served
in
china
and
silver
that
were
seldom
used
in
peter
askew
time
the
low
room
had
been
cleverly
painted
and
a
casement
commanding
a
view
of
the
dale
replaced
the
original
narrow
windows
specimens
of
ancient
indian
pottery
stood
on
the
sideboard
and
there
were
curtains
of
embroidered
silk
and
silverwork
that
kit
had
brought
from
spanish
america
the
things
gave
the
lonely
farmstead
an
exotic
touch
but
they
implied
the
command
of
money
and
cultivated
taste
you
have
a
beautiful
room
gerald
remarked
when
the
meal
was
over
do
know
that
i
much
of
a
connoisseur
but
some
of
the
things
look
rather
fine
i
show
them
to
you
presently
kit
replied
and
gave
gerald
a
small
dark
cigar
i
wonder
how
you
like
the
flavor
our
club
cigars
are
dear
and
good
but
the
best
is
nothing
like
this
gerald
declared
after
a
minute
or
two
where
did
they
come
from
they
were
given
me
in
cuba
i
believe
the
make
is
not
offered
for
public
sale
in
a
general
way
cuban
tobacco
is
not
what
it
was
but
there
are
belts
of
soil
that
grow
a
leaf
that
ca
be
equaled
anywhere
else
i
suppose
they
keep
the
crop
for
presidents
and
dictators
the
quality
indicates
it
gerald
suggested
and
kit
smiled
gerald
tasted
his
black
coffee
if
it
not
bad
form
where
did
you
get
this
there
nothing
of
the
kind
in
cumberland
and
it
better
than
the
turkish
they
give
you
in
london
it
came
from
a
costa
rican
and
was
a
gift
i
get
no
more
when
the
bag
is
done
if
you
come
back
in
a
month
you
find
me
living
in
plain
style
i
imagine
you
made
up
for
that
while
you
were
away
said
gerald
who
rose
and
went
to
the
a
curious
little
jar
and
obviously
old
is
this
the
kind
of
thing
the
aztecs
made
i
rather
think
it
is
aztec
though
i
did
buy
it
in
mexico
i
gave
about
a
pound
for
the
jar
and
found
a
gold
onza
inside
an
oh
yes
an
ounce
the
kind
of
coin
some
countries
mint
but
very
seldom
use
something
of
a
bargain
i
suppose
it
was
kit
replied
incautiously
for
all
that
the
onza
was
mine
and
in
a
sense
my
efforts
to
find
the
owner
cost
me
a
very
large
sum
gerald
gave
him
a
keen
glance
askew
was
not
boasting
he
had
enjoyed
the
command
of
money
well
he
said
i
think
i
have
kept
the
onza
whether
it
was
mine
or
not
he
paused
and
pulled
a
knife
from
its
sheath
the
handle
was
ornamented
and
the
narrow
blade
glittered
in
the
light
although
its
point
was
dull
but
what
is
this
has
it
a
story
take
care
said
kit
it
may
be
poisoned
the
use
a
stuff
that
will
kill
you
if
a
very
small
quantity
gets
into
your
blood
the
fellow
who
owned
that
knife
came
near
burying
it
in
my
back
it
looks
as
if
you
had
had
some
adventures
gerald
remarked
and
leaning
against
the
sideboard
he
lighted
a
cigarette
kit
crossed
the
floor
and
stood
by
the
open
window
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
rested
motionless
a
patch
of
cool
neutral
color
on
the
gleaming
yellow
side
of
the
hill
a
tree
hung
over
a
neighboring
wall
and
bees
hummed
drowsily
among
the
flowers
he
was
strangely
satisfied
to
be
at
home
and
it
was
hard
to
realize
that
not
long
since
he
had
been
engaged
in
a
dangerous
trade
among
the
swamps
have
you
any
more
curiosities
gerald
asked
kit
opened
a
drawer
in
his
big
desk
where
he
kept
specimens
of
featherwork
as
he
took
them
out
he
moved
some
documents
and
gerald
indicated
one
your
name
in
castilian
i
suppose
you
write
a
curious
hand
a
matter
of
precaution
anyhow
i
did
sign
this
order
and
that
why
i
kept
it
the
thing
was
rather
important
and
we
were
lucky
to
find
out
the
cheat
in
time
particularly
as
i
imagined
nobody
could
imitate
my
hand
you
see
my
proper
signature
on
the
next
document
it
not
a
very
good
counterfeit
said
gerald
who
compared
the
writing
with
the
other
this
is
a
subject
i
know
something
about
penmanship
is
one
of
my
few
talents
and
i
keep
the
customers
signature
book
at
the
bank
yours
is
an
uncommon
hand
but
it
could
be
forged
let
see
may
i
use
this
paper
kit
nodded
and
gerald
knitting
his
brows
wrote
the
name
three
or
four
times
and
then
looked
up
i
think
i
got
it
hard
to
tell
which
is
genuine
if
you
put
them
side
by
side
yes
said
kit
i
not
sure
i
could
tell
which
is
mine
gerald
laughed
one
has
to
study
these
things
part
of
my
job
you
see
and
banks
are
cheated
oftener
than
people
think
however
i
expect
you
want
to
get
to
work
and
i
go
back
to
the
tarn
he
went
out
and
kit
tore
up
the
paper
he
thought
a
talent
like
might
be
dangerous
if
it
were
used
by
an
unscrupulous
man
chapter
iii
the
horse
show
it
was
a
calm
evening
and
osborn
sat
on
the
terrace
studying
a
printed
notice
osborn
poured
out
coffee
at
a
small
table
and
gerald
and
grace
occupied
the
top
of
the
broad
steps
to
the
lawn
the
sun
was
low
the
air
was
cool
and
except
for
the
soft
splash
of
a
beck
a
deep
quietness
brooded
over
the
dale
it
will
be
a
good
show
osborn
remarked
reaching
for
a
cup
i
insisted
on
the
rather
early
date
because
if
we
had
waited
until
the
hay
was
in
we
might
have
got
wet
weather
two
or
three
objected
but
satisfied
i
took
the
proper
line
one
must
be
firm
with
an
argumentative
committee
gerald
eyes
twinkled
as
he
looked
at
grace
osborn
generally
was
firm
with
people
who
gave
way
and
gerald
had
heard
some
grumbling
about
his
changing
the
date
for
the
horse
show
it
the
last
time
i
be
president
osborn
resumed
i
had
meant
to
resign
but
thorn
could
not
take
the
post
sir
george
is
away
and
a
local
man
is
needed
to
give
the
thing
a
proper
start
rather
an
expensive
honor
gerald
observed
the
president
expected
to
make
up
the
shortage
if
the
day
is
wet
that
was
one
reason
for
my
fixing
the
meeting
early
when
we
often
get
it
fine
osborn
replied
naïvely
the
expense
is
a
drawback
but
the
committee
would
not
let
me
drop
out
mother
and
grace
will
want
new
hats
and
clothes
and
i
expect
the
job
will
cost
you
more
than
you
think
you
have
to
give
them
a
lead
by
bidding
for
the
chapel
sheep
if
that
meddlesome
fellow
drysdale
is
going
to
send
his
sheep
to
the
show
the
arrangement
was
made
without
my
knowing
osborn
replied
angrily
osborn
looked
disturbed
but
gerald
laughed
he
rather
enjoyed
provoking
his
father
when
he
thought
it
safe
drysdale
was
treasurer
for
a
body
of
nonconformists
who
wanted
to
build
a
new
chapel
and
finding
the
farmers
reluctant
to
give
money
had
asked
for
contributions
from
their
flocks
and
herds
the
idea
was
that
the
sale
would
be
an
extra
attraction
gerald
went
on
still
i
admit
it
hard
for
you
because
you
hate
chapels
and
will
have
to
bid
in
fact
you
no
doubt
have
to
buy
the
sheep
at
a
sentimental
price
and
sell
them
at
their
value
i
believe
in
liberty
of
conscience
and
do
not
hate
chapels
osborn
rejoined
for
all
that
i
own
to
a
natural
prejudice
against
people
who
attend
such
places
largely
because
they
mix
up
their
religious
and
political
creeds
it
would
be
strange
if
i
sympathized
with
their
plans
for
robbing
the
landlords
anyhow
drysdale
means
to
bring
his
flock
and
i
afraid
you
have
to
pay
the
situation
has
some
humor
osborn
knitted
his
brows
hayes
had
been
talking
to
him
about
the
estate
accounts
and
he
had
resolved
to
practise
stern
economy
economy
was
needful
unless
he
gave
a
fresh
mortgage
to
pay
the
interest
on
his
other
debts
and
here
was
an
expense
he
had
not
bargained
for
if
i
known
about
drysdale
i
have
resigned
he
said
i
took
the
post
again
because
there
was
nobody
else
they
might
have
tried
askew
gerald
suggested
askew
a
fellow
of
no
importance
unknown
outside
the
dale
i
imagine
he
be
better
known
soon
and
he
rather
a
good
sort
gave
me
a
very
good
lunch
not
long
since
and
has
obviously
spent
something
on
the
farm
his
room
is
like
a
museum
and
he
has
a
number
of
valuable
things
seems
to
have
had
some
adventures
abroad
and
found
them
profitable
you
mean
he
tried
to
impress
you
by
vague
boasting
no
said
gerald
i
do
think
he
did
the
fellow
not
that
kind
in
fact
he
rather
good
form
and
has
somehow
got
the
proper
stamp
grace
looked
at
her
brother
as
if
she
agreed
but
osborn
remarked
ironically
you
imagine
yourself
a
judge
oh
well
said
gerald
smiling
i
had
the
advantage
of
being
brought
up
at
tarnside
and
belong
to
a
good
london
club
anyhow
much
less
provincial
than
some
of
our
exclusive
friends
he
strolled
off
and
osborn
went
to
the
library
where
he
spent
some
time
studying
his
accounts
the
calculations
he
made
were
disturbing
and
he
resented
the
possibility
of
his
being
forced
to
help
drysdale
fund
nevertheless
the
president
of
the
show
would
be
expected
to
lead
the
bidding
and
the
osborns
did
things
properly
a
week
or
two
afterwards
osborn
opened
the
show
in
a
field
by
the
which
stood
in
a
hollow
among
the
moors
the
grass
sloped
to
a
river
that
sparkled
in
the
sun
and
then
vanished
in
the
alders
shade
across
the
stream
old
oak
and
ash
trees
rolled
up
the
side
of
the
moot
hill
and
round
the
latter
gray
walls
and
roofs
showed
among
the
leaves
a
spire
and
a
square
tower
rose
above
the
faint
blue
haze
of
smoke
a
few
white
clouds
floated
in
the
sky
and
their
cool
shadows
crept
slowly
across
the
field
the
horses
were
not
very
numerous
but
the
show
had
other
attractions
and
was
an
excuse
for
a
general
holiday
the
crowd
was
larger
than
usual
osborn
nervous
speech
was
cheered
and
for
a
time
osborn
forgot
that
the
office
he
had
taken
might
cost
him
something
he
was
carrying
out
a
duty
he
owed
the
neighborhood
and
felt
that
he
could
do
so
better
than
anybody
else
he
did
not
admit
that
he
liked
to
take
the
leading
place
his
first
annoyance
came
with
the
trials
he
had
not
known
askew
was
a
competitor
and
frowned
as
he
saw
grace
go
up
to
him
when
a
flock
of
herdwicks
entered
the
field
the
girl
ought
to
have
seen
that
it
was
not
the
proper
thing
for
his
daughter
to
proclaim
her
acquaintance
with
the
fellow
then
gerald
followed
her
and
began
talking
to
askew
as
if
he
knew
him
well
gerald
was
of
course
irresponsibly
eccentric
but
his
folly
jarred
grace
had
found
it
needful
to
get
a
new
dress
and
hat
and
kit
thrilled
and
tried
to
hide
his
delight
in
her
beauty
as
she
advanced
his
dog
ran
to
meet
her
and
she
stroked
its
shaggy
head
i
hope
bob
is
going
to
win
she
remarked
it
doubtful
kit
replied
he
clever
but
they
do
give
us
much
time
and
he
getting
slow
one
or
two
of
his
rivals
are
very
good
you
do
your
best
old
bob
said
grace
and
the
dog
looking
up
at
her
with
friendly
eyes
beat
his
tail
on
the
ground
then
gerald
came
up
and
soon
afterwards
the
judges
tied
a
string
to
a
farmer
leg
and
fastened
the
other
end
to
a
post
this
allowed
him
to
run
a
short
distance
after
which
he
must
direct
his
dog
by
voice
first
trial
forsyth
merry
lad
a
steward
announced
and
the
crowd
gathered
round
when
the
judge
took
out
his
watch
furze
bushes
had
been
stuck
into
the
ground
to
simulate
a
broken
hedge
beyond
these
was
a
row
of
hurdles
with
an
open
gate
and
then
a
number
of
obstacles
while
a
railed
pen
occupied
a
corner
of
the
field
kit
gave
grace
a
card
showing
the
way
the
sheep
must
be
driven
round
the
different
barriers
it
a
good
test
particularly
as
we
ca
follow
the
dogs
and
they
must
take
each
obstacle
in
its
proper
turn
they
are
wonderfully
clever
to
understand
said
grace
and
stopped
when
the
judge
shouted
time
the
farmer
called
his
dog
a
handsome
collie
that
set
off
with
a
bound
and
drove
the
sheep
at
full
speed
towards
the
furze
as
they
came
up
with
fleeces
shaking
and
a
patter
of
little
feet
the
man
ran
to
the
length
of
the
string
and
waved
his
stick
away
back
gan
away
back
slap
ye
fule
people
laughed
when
the
dog
in
desperate
haste
stopped
the
sheep
as
they
packed
outside
a
hole
but
it
drove
them
to
the
next
gap
through
which
they
streamed
forrad
gan
forrad
cried
the
farmer
head
them
merry
lad
the
dog
turned
the
sheep
and
brought
them
back
through
another
opening
after
which
they
raced
towards
the
hurdles
and
the
collie
hesitated
as
if
puzzled
by
its
master
shouts
the
sheep
were
near
the
end
of
the
rails
but
it
was
not
the
end
the
card
indicated
then
the
dog
seemed
to
understand
what
was
required
and
circling
round
the
flock
with
swift
graceful
leaps
drove
them
along
the
hurdles
and
round
the
other
end
there
was
some
applause
from
the
crowd
and
afterwards
banter
when
the
dog
ran
backwards
and
forwards
at
a
loss
the
animal
obviously
knew
the
flock
must
be
taken
round
the
remaining
obstacles
but
had
only
its
master
shouts
for
guide
to
the
order
in
which
they
must
be
passed
sometimes
the
farmer
got
angry
and
sometimes
laughed
but
except
for
a
mistake
or
two
the
collie
drove
the
sheep
in
and
out
among
the
barriers
as
the
card
required
and
put
them
in
the
pen
two
or
three
more
trials
took
place
and
for
the
most
part
the
unoccupied
dogs
strained
at
their
leads
and
whimpered
but
old
bob
sat
at
kit
feet
watching
with
his
head
on
one
side
one
can
see
he
thinking
i
believe
he
wants
to
remember
the
right
way
round
grace
remarked
and
smiled
when
a
steward
beckoned
kit
your
turn
she
said
i
wish
you
good
luck
kit
went
off
with
his
heart
beating
and
felt
half
amused
by
his
keenness
when
the
steward
tied
the
string
to
his
leg
after
his
adventures
on
the
caribbean
and
the
stakes
he
and
adam
had
played
for
it
was
strange
he
should
be
eager
to
win
a
box
of
plated
forks
at
a
rustic
show
yet
he
was
eager
grace
had
wished
him
luck
number
four
askew
old
bob
the
steward
announced
kit
called
and
bob
trotting
away
deliberately
got
the
sheep
together
and
drove
them
correctly
through
the
holes
he
was
doing
well
in
one
sense
and
kit
knew
he
would
make
few
mistakes
but
time
counted
and
old
bob
was
slow
he
had
trouble
at
the
hurdles
where
the
sheep
seemed
resolved
to
go
the
wrong
way
but
he
stopped
them
and
took
them
back
to
the
proper
end
kit
gave
very
few
orders
although
he
looked
at
his
watch
rather
anxiously
bob
understood
and
could
be
trusted
to
do
his
work
the
trouble
was
he
might
not
finish
it
in
time
at
length
kit
drew
a
deep
breath
and
put
back
his
watch
the
sheep
were
in
the
pen
and
there
was
a
minute
left
kit
went
back
to
grace
and
bob
trotted
up
panting
with
his
tongue
hanging
out
he
looked
at
kit
as
if
for
approval
and
then
after
wagging
his
tail
when
his
master
spoke
held
up
his
paw
to
grace
hallo
said
kit
i
have
known
him
to
do
that
before
it
not
a
sheepdog
trick
i
taught
him
grace
replied
with
a
touch
of
color
he
has
not
forgotten
and
really
deserves
to
be
stroked
she
went
away
but
she
gave
kit
a
smile
across
the
railing
behind
which
she
stood
with
osborn
when
the
judge
called
out
first
prize
number
four
askew
bob
when
lunch
was
served
in
a
big
tent
osborn
sat
at
the
top
of
the
table
but
his
satisfaction
had
vanished
for
one
thing
everybody
had
applauded
when
askew
won
the
prize
the
fellow
was
obviously
a
favorite
and
this
annoyed
him
then
drysdale
sheep
were
to
be
sold
by
auction
after
lunch
and
the
committee
had
hinted
that
the
president
was
the
proper
person
to
buy
the
flock
drysdale
sat
next
to
kit
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
he
was
a
little
man
with
a
brown
face
and
a
twinkling
smile
where
are
the
sheep
kit
asked
we
send
t
band
for
them
presently
are
you
gan
t
bid
i
do
know
until
i
seen
them
what
about

young
ram

strain
i
do
know
how

then
i
ca
see
mayson
giving
away

drysdale
grinned
some
big
stanes
fell
on
t
ram
when
mayson
was
bringing
flock
doon
barra
ghyll
he
looks
a
bit
the
waur
o
it
but
you
can
tell
the
carlside
blood
i
see
what
i
think
about
the
animal
kit
said
with
a
laugh
do
you
expect
a
good
sale
the
rich
people
as
a
rule
go
to
church
they
bid
aw
t
same
when
you
canna
stir
their
generosity
you
can
try
their
pride
if
you
look
at
it
one
way
the
thing
humorsome
they
dinna
want
to
help
me
but
they
will
it
possible
kit
agreed
i
do
know
if
the
plan
above
suspicion
but
you
need
the
money
it
will
be
weel
spent
hooiver
i
must
be
off
and
see
the
band
dinna
get
ower
much
to
drink
drysdale
went
away
and
soon
afterwards
a
strange
procession
headed
by
the
band
and
guarded
by
children
entered
the
field
a
row
of
geese
waddling
solemnly
in
single
file
came
first
and
then
turkeys
stalked
among
their
broods
a
boy
led
a
handsome
goat
and
calf
and
in
the
rear
straggled
a
flock
of
sheep
when
all
were
driven
into
pens
the
sale
began
and
the
crowd
laughed
and
bantered
the
men
who
bid
in
the
meantime
kit
examined
the
sheep
some
had
faults
and
the
ram
had
obviously
suffered
from
its
accident
it
was
clear
though
that
it
sprang
from
a
famous
stock
and
kit
knew
an
animal
transmits
to
its
offspring
inherited
qualities
and
not
acquired
defects
he
recognized
the
stamp
of
breeding
and
resolved
to
buy
the
sheep
the
ram
was
worth
much
more
than
he
imagined
the
shepherds
thought
he
went
back
to
the
stand
and
by
and
by
the
auctioneer
praised
the
flock
when
he
stopped
there
was
silence
for
a
few
moments
until
osborn
nodded
a
cautious
beginning
often
makes
a
good
ending
but
we
a
long
way
to
go
yet
the
auctioneer
remarked
who
say
five
pounds
more
thorn
made
a
sign
and
the
auctioneer
raised
his
hammer
we
got
a
start
but
you
must
keep
it
up
the
opportunity
what
folks
call
unique
you
save
money
by
buying
and
help
a
good
cause
know
which
will
appeal
to
you
but
you
can
pay
your
money
and
take
your
choice
he
looked
about
while
the
crowd
laughed
and
after
two
or
three
flockmasters
advanced
the
price
caught
kit
eye
askew
a
judge
of
sheep
we
call
it
ten
pounds
rise
kit
nodded
and
osborn
glanced
at
thorn
who
shrugged
the
latter
had
helped
to
start
the
bidding
which
was
all
he
meant
to
do
and
osborn
would
have
tried
to
draw
out
after
making
another
offer
had
he
not
seen
kit
he
did
not
want
the
sheep
although
he
was
willing
to
buy
them
at
something
above
their
proper
price
now
however
askew
was
his
antagonist
the
fellow
must
be
beaten
we
must
finish
the
sale
before
the
he
said
go
up
twenty
pounds
they
not
sell
near
it
if
you
sent
them
to
the
market
a
farmer
remarked
do
you
sell
pedigree
stock
to
butchers
the
ram
worth
the
money
the
auctioneer
rejoined
on
the
whole
kit
agreed
although
he
saw
that
others
did
not
moreover
he
was
willing
to
run
some
risk
by
helping
drysdale
whom
he
liked
and
he
signed
to
the
auctioneer
the
farmers
stopped
but
osborn
went
on
he
had
not
liked
peter
askew
and
liked
kit
worse
father
and
son
had
opposed
him
and
now
the
young
upstart
was
proud
of
the
money
he
had
no
doubt
got
by
doubtful
means
he
would
not
let
the
fellow
balk
him
and
his
face
got
red
as
he
answered
the
auctioneer
inquiring
glance
presently
he
turned
with
a
frown
as
hayes
touched
his
arm
it
an
extravagant
price
the
agent
remarked
they
want
a
check
and
your
account
is
getting
very
low
you
have
to
cut
down
expenses
then
osborn
answered
haughtily
this
is
not
a
matter
about
which
i
need
your
advice
hayes
shrugged
and
osborn
nodded
to
the
auctioneer
when
kit
made
another
bid
he
felt
hot
and
savage
and
wanted
a
drink
but
could
not
leave
the
stand
askew
meant
to
humiliate
him
and
he
must
hold
out
he
was
the
most
important
man
in
the
neighborhood
and
must
not
be
beaten
by
a
small
farmer
for
all
that
the
sum
he
would
have
to
pay
would
be
a
drain
after
the
next
bid
the
auctioneer
looked
at
kit
who
smiled
and
shook
his
head
osborn
takes
the
lot
the
auctioneer
remarked
he
has
paid
a
high
price
to
help
a
good
object
but
i
think
we
all
hope
the
next
lambing
season
will
give
him
his
money
back
osborn
savage
satisfaction
was
spoiled
by
a
chilling
doubt
and
he
went
off
to
look
for
hayes
give
the
fellow
a
check
for
the
sheep
on
the
estate
account
he
said
how
much
hayes
asked
and
looked
thoughtful
when
osborn
told
him
there
are
a
number
of
bills
to
meet
and
we
have
no
money
coming
in
until
ca
you
put
off
the
bills
i
think
not
hayes
answered
meaningly
it
might
be
prudent
our
credit
is
not
too
good
osborn
was
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
very
well
he
said
i
try
to
sell
the
sheep
to
somebody
who
give
me
what
they
really
worth
come
over
and
we
talk
about
the
new
mortgage
then
he
went
back
moodily
to
join
the
judges
for
the
chapter
iv
the
flood
on
the
morning
after
the
show
osborn
walked
up
and
down
the
terrace
waiting
moodily
for
hayes
it
was
a
rash
extravagance
to
buy
the
sheep
and
he
blamed
kit
for
this
the
fellow
had
gone
on
bidding
in
order
to
force
him
to
pay
a
high
price
besides
the
money
would
help
an
object
osborn
did
not
approve
there
were
enough
chapels
in
the
neighborhood
and
any
legislation
that
interfered
with
the
landlords
privileges
got
its
warmest
support
at
such
places
the
sum
he
had
spent
was
not
remarkably
large
and
he
had
cut
his
loss
by
selling
the
flock
to
a
farmer
at
their
market
price
but
this
was
about
half
what
he
had
given
and
he
had
some
urgent
debts
although
he
had
hoped
to
hold
out
until
when
the
payment
of
rents
would
ease
the
strain
on
his
finances
he
must
have
money
and
did
not
know
where
it
could
be
got
by
prudent
means
in
the
meantime
he
looked
about
gloomily
the
weather
had
changed
a
moist
west
wind
drove
heavy
clouds
across
the
sky
and
the
were
hidden
by
mist
it
threatened
a
wet
and
hay
was
scarce
in
the
dale
where
they
generally
cut
it
late
after
feeding
sheep
on
the
meadows
osborn
farmed
some
of
his
land
and
had
hoped
for
a
good
crop
which
he
needed
the
grass
in
the
big
meadow
by
the
beck
was
long
and
getting
ripe
but
the
red
sorrel
that
grew
among
it
had
lost
its
bright
color
the
filling
heads
rolled
in
waves
before
the
wind
but
there
was
something
dull
and
lifeless
in
the
noise
they
made
and
osborn
knew
what
this
meant
rain
was
coming
and
when
rain
began
in
the
dale
it
did
not
stop
his
glance
rested
on
the
green
embankment
along
the
beck
his
father
had
made
the
dyke
at
a
heavy
cost
but
in
places
the
stones
and
soil
had
gradually
washed
away
if
the
dyke
broke
at
one
spot
the
beck
would
return
to
its
old
channel
and
much
damage
might
be
done
particularly
if
the
floods
rolled
across
the
turnip
fields
osborn
had
meant
to
strengthen
the
dyke
but
had
put
it
off
because
of
the
expense
a
little
later
hayes
came
up
the
steps
osborn
did
not
ask
him
to
sit
down
although
there
was
room
on
the
stone
bench
and
the
agent
leaned
against
the
terrace
wall
his
face
was
inscrutable
but
he
remarked
his
employer
rudeness
i
have
seen
fisher
and
he
is
willing
to
take
a
mortgage
on
ryecote
he
said
the
interest
is
higher
than
i
thought
but
the
money
would
pay
off
urgent
bills
and
cover
the
cost
of
the
farmstead
repairs
how
much
does
fisher
want
osborn
asked
and
frowned
when
he
was
told
it
unjust
two
per
cent
above
the
proper
interest
i
ca
borrow
for
less
however
if
we
use
the
money
judiciously
we
ought
to
get
something
back
by
higher
rents
lang
and
grey
for
example
would
pay
a
little
more
for
the
improvements
they
require
osborn
pondered
he
was
in
a
suspicious
mood
and
thought
hayes
wanted
to
negotiate
the
mortgage
when
i
have
satisfied
the
other
tenants
there
wo
be
much
left
for
lang
and
grey
he
rejoined
my
experience
is
that
the
money
you
sink
in
improvements
is
gone
for
good
they
must
be
made
for
all
that
particularly
just
now
when
a
dissatisfied
spirit
is
spreading
among
the
farmers
askew
is
showing
them
what
can
be
done
by
the
proper
use
of
capital
askew
osborn
exclaimed
father
and
son
the
askews
have
been
the
origin
of
the
worst
trouble
i
had
hayes
was
willing
to
indulge
osborn
rancor
and
derived
a
rather
malicious
satisfaction
from
seeing
him
annoyed
besides
he
did
not
want
to
dwell
upon
the
mortgage
i
wonder
whether
you
know
askew
has
bought
drysdale
sheep
i
did
not
know
i
sold
the
flock
to
graham
then
askew
must
have
bought
them
soon
afterwards
unless
he
sent
graham
to
make
the
deal
with
you
osborn
face
got
red
a
shabby
trick
unthinkably
shabby
after
he
forced
up
the
price
he
paused
and
tried
to
control
his
anger
but
why
did
he
buy
that
lot
there
was
a
carlside
ram
only
fit
for
mutton
i
studied
the
animal
oh
well
askew
no
doubt
thinks
he
is
a
judge
i
imagine
he
bought
the
others
in
order
to
get
the
ram
he
cheated
me
said
osborn
with
a
savage
frown
the
fellow
a
cunning
rogue
i
wish
he
had
come
back
confound
him
he
pulled
himself
up
and
added
however
about
the
mortgage
i
suppose
i
must
agree
to
fisher
terms
see
him
and
arrange
the
thing
as
soon
as
possible
hayes
went
away
and
osborn
lighted
a
cigar
he
had
a
disturbing
feeling
that
he
had
been
rash
the
money
would
not
last
long
and
if
he
had
not
borrowed
it
he
might
have
paid
the
interest
on
other
loans
buying
the
sheep
had
really
decided
him
to
give
the
mortgage
since
it
had
made
him
feel
keenly
the
embarrassment
of
having
very
little
money
at
command
there
was
another
thing
hayes
wanted
him
to
borrow
the
fresh
sum
although
a
prudent
agent
would
try
to
keep
the
estate
out
of
debt
he
could
not
see
hayes
object
and
felt
suspicious
but
while
he
pondered
it
began
to
rain
and
he
went
into
the
house
it
rained
all
day
and
at
dusk
the
mist
had
crept
down
the
hills
the
long
grass
in
the
meadow
bent
before
the
deluge
and
slanted
from
the
wind
the
becks
began
to
roar
in
the
gyhlls
and
threads
of
foam
glimmered
in
the
mist
a
hoarse
turmoil
rose
from
the
stream
that
fed
the
tarn
and
an
angry
flood
stained
brown
by
peat
rose
steadily
up
the
dyke
there
was
no
promise
of
better
weather
when
osborn
went
to
bed
and
he
had
known
rain
like
that
last
for
a
week
in
fact
he
had
known
all
the
hay
crop
and
the
most
part
of
the
young
turnips
washed
down
the
valley
the
rain
was
heavier
when
early
next
morning
kit
went
out
to
move
some
sheep
from
a
spot
where
the
rising
water
might
cut
them
off
he
came
back
along
the
meadow
dyke
and
stopped
for
a
few
minutes
when
he
reached
its
weakest
place
reeds
and
tufts
of
heather
whirled
down
the
brown
flood
wide
patches
of
turf
and
soil
had
fallen
away
uncovering
the
foundation
of
boulders
and
gravel
and
while
kit
looked
down
a
heavy
stone
rolled
out
of
its
place
and
plunged
into
the
stream
others
were
ready
to
go
the
water
was
rising
ominously
fast
and
would
rise
for
some
time
after
the
rain
stopped
there
was
however
nothing
to
indicate
that
it
would
stop
and
kit
knowing
his
native
climate
looked
about
with
some
uneasiness
a
hollow
across
the
meadow
to
a
hedge
behind
which
were
two
large
turnip
fields
and
he
knew
this
marked
a
former
channel
of
the
beck
it
was
long
since
the
water
had
flowed
that
way
but
his
father
had
told
him
that
in
heavy
floods
it
had
some
times
spread
across
the
fields
and
joined
the
other
stream
at
allerby
if
this
happened
again
the
bottom
of
the
dale
would
be
covered
and
the
crops
ruined
when
he
was
going
away
three
or
four
men
with
picks
and
spades
came
up
are
you
going
to
mend
the
dyke
he
asked
we
gan
to
try
said
one
i
reckon
we
not
can
hoad
her
up
if
beck
rises
much
she
rise
three
or
four
feet
said
kit
is
nobody
else
coming
neabody
we
ken
aboot
osborn
sent
to
allerby
first
thing
but
miller
wad
let
him
have
a
man
kit
thought
hard
bell
had
given
up
the
mill
and
his
successor
had
a
dispute
with
hayes
to
repair
the
dyke
properly
would
be
a
long
and
expensive
business
since
there
were
a
number
of
weak
spots
but
a
dozen
men
working
hard
might
perhaps
strengthen
the
threatened
part
sufficiently
to
bear
the
strain
clearly
if
they
were
to
be
of
use
they
must
be
found
and
set
to
work
at
once
in
a
sense
the
risk
was
osborn
who
would
pay
for
his
neglect
but
the
flood
might
damage
his
fields
and
even
if
the
damage
were
confined
to
osborn
kit
hated
to
see
crops
spoiled
you
had
better
begin
he
said
i
try
to
get
help
mayhappen
folks
will
come
for
you
though
they
wad
for
t
maister
one
replied
we
need
aw
you
can
get
before
lang
kit
set
off
as
fast
as
he
could
walk
and
stopping
for
a
minute
at
ashness
sent
his
men
then
he
went
on
to
allerby
and
at
first
found
the
farmers
unwilling
to
move
but
after
some
argument
they
went
with
him
to
the
mill
we
hear
what
miller
has
to
say
one
remarked
he
kens
maist
aboot
the
job
sin
he
had
t
mend
t
lade
when
hayes
refused
for
aw
that
mending
dyke
is
landlord
business
i
not
stir
a
hand
to
save
osborn
crops
the
miller
declared
when
he
met
them
at
the
door
his
oad
rogue
o
an
agent
promised
me
build
up
brocken
lade
but
when
time
came
i
had
to
mysel
two
of
the
others
grumbled
about
promises
hayes
had
not
kept
and
then
kit
said
all
this
is
not
important
i
do
ask
you
to
mend
the
dyke
for
osborn
sake
but
yours
if
the
beck
breaks
through
and
runs
down
to
allerby
it
will
spoil
all
the
hay
and
fill
the
with
rubbish
then
we
get
compensation
landlord
bound
to
keep
dyke
in
order
kit
smiled
you
get
nothing
unless
you
go
to
law
and
i
do
know
if
you
get
much
then
hayes
is
clever
and
the
dispute
would
be
expensive
you
certainly
find
it
cheaper
to
mend
the
dyke
they
pondered
this
until
the
miller
made
a
sign
of
agreement
i
not
can
say
you
wrang
i
coming
with
my
two
men
kit
told
him
to
bring
a
horse
and
cart
and
the
party
set
off
for
the
threatened
bank
the
beck
had
risen
while
kit
was
away
and
stones
and
soil
slipped
down
into
the
flood
an
angry
turmoil
indicated
that
the
current
had
rolled
the
rubbish
into
a
dam
we
gotten
our
job
said
the
miller
as
he
drove
in
his
spade
they
got
to
work
but
the
current
that
undermined
the
bank
brought
down
the
turf
and
soil
with
which
they
tried
to
fill
the
holes
it
was
plain
that
a
stronger
material
was
needed
and
kit
sent
some
men
to
a
roadmaker
quarry
at
the
bottom
of
the
fell
while
he
rearranged
some
harness
when
he
had
finished
he
fastened
an
extra
horse
outside
the
shafts
of
the
carts
and
two
men
drove
the
teams
across
the
field
they
went
off
fast
jolting
the
carts
by
their
clumsy
trot
but
kit
knew
the
extra
horse
would
be
needed
when
they
returned
soon
afterwards
osborn
came
up
the
other
bank
and
stopped
opposite
with
the
rain
running
off
his
mackintosh
has
anybody
given
you
leave
to
meddle
with
the
dyke
he
asked
no
said
kit
we
let
it
alone
if
you
like
but
there
wo
be
much
of
your
hay
left
when
the
flood
breaks
through
and
i
imagine
you
could
be
made
responsible
for
other
damage
osborn
hesitated
and
kit
seeing
his
frown
began
to
wonder
whether
he
would
send
him
away
then
he
resumed
who
engaged
these
men
i
do
know
that
they
are
engaged
anyhow
if
there
a
difficulty
about
their
getting
paid
i
accountable
bring
them
to
tarnside
when
you
have
finished
osborn
answered
and
went
off
kit
resumed
his
work
with
savage
energy
he
thought
osborn
did
not
deserve
to
be
helped
but
this
did
not
matter
much
others
would
suffer
unless
he
finished
the
job
he
had
undertaken
and
it
almost
looked
as
if
the
flood
would
beat
him
the
trench
from
which
they
dug
the
soil
they
needed
filled
with
water
the
spades
got
slippery
with
rain
and
mud
and
the
horses
sank
in
the
trampled
slough
kit
however
had
made
his
plans
while
he
looked
for
help
and
had
forgotten
nothing
that
he
might
want
hammers
drills
and
a
can
of
powder
had
been
brought
and
now
and
then
a
dull
report
rolled
across
the
dale
and
heavy
stones
crashed
in
the
quarry
when
he
had
stone
enough
he
and
one
or
two
others
stood
on
the
front
of
the
bank
with
the
water
washing
round
their
legs
while
they
built
up
the
ragged
blocks
the
pieces
were
hard
to
fit
and
sometimes
the
rude
wall
broke
when
the
men
on
top
threw
down
the
backing
of
soil
kit
tore
his
hand
on
a
sharp
corner
but
persisted
while
the
blood
ran
down
his
fingers
and
his
wet
clothes
stuck
to
his
skin
the
others
supported
him
well
and
he
only
stopped
for
breath
and
to
wipe
from
his
eyes
the
water
that
trickled
off
his
soaked
hat
the
loaded
cart
ploughing
through
the
mire
met
the
other
going
back
the
men
at
the
quarry
kept
him
supplied
and
when
he
had
made
a
foundation
the
bank
began
to
rise
for
all
that
the
beck
rose
almost
as
fast
and
at
noon
they
had
not
gained
much
on
the
flood
kit
was
doubtful
but
on
the
whole
thought
it
prudent
to
let
the
men
stop
they
had
worked
hard
and
could
not
keep
it
up
without
a
rest
when
they
collected
with
their
dinner
cans
under
a
dripping
hedge
one
remarked
mayhappen
we
better
wait
for
osborn
to
send
cold
meat
and
ale
i
mak
a
start
with
bread
and
cheese
the
others
grinned
but
kit
got
up
as
he
heard
a
rattle
of
wheels
begin
just
yet
two
of
you
go
to
the
gate
the
men
came
back
with
a
big
jar
and
a
basket
and
the
others
gathered
round
when
kit
took
off
the
clean
wet
cloth
yon
lunch
niver
came
fra

it
ower

and
liberal
said
one

folk
dinna
believe
in
sending
a
jar
when
they
had
eaten
and
drunk
one
or
two
tried
to
light
their
pipes
but
gave
it
up
and
they
got
to
work
again
kit
hand
hurt
it
was
long
since
he
had
undertaken
much
manual
labor
and
his
muscles
felt
horribly
stiff
he
knew
however
that
the
men
needed
a
leader
not
a
superintendent
and
he
would
not
urge
them
to
efforts
he
shirked
and
a
leader
was
all
they
needed
they
had
no
liking
for
osborn
but
they
were
stubborn
and
now
they
had
begun
they
meant
to
finish
shovels
clinked
stones
rattled
from
the
carts
and
the
pile
of
earth
and
rock
rose
faster
than
the
flood
in
the
meantime
the
mist
got
thicker
and
the
rain
swept
the
valley
the
long
grass
near
the
trench
was
trodden
into
pulp
where
the
turf
was
cut
the
surface
of
the
bank
melted
and
the
men
stumbled
as
they
climbed
it
with
their
loads
the
wheelbarrows
poured
down
water
as
well
as
sticky
soil
and
kit
clothes
got
stiff
with
mud
despite
this
he
held
out
until
in
the
evening
the
strengthened
dyke
stood
high
above
the
stream
then
he
threw
down
his
spade
and
stretched
his
aching
arms
i
think
she
hold
the
water
back
and
we
can
do
no
more
said
kit
the
others
gathered
up
their
tools
and
climbing
into
the
carts
drove
down
the
dale
when
they
reached
the
tarnside
lodge
kit
pulled
up
you
have
done
a
good
job
for
osborn
and
there
no
reason
you
get
your
pay
he
said
two
or
three
jumped
down
without
much
enthusiasm
and
the
old
gardener
came
out
and
gave
one
an
envelope
for
askew
he
remarked
is
that
all
the
other
asked
and
the
gardener
grinned
that
all
what
did
you
expect
the
man
took
the
envelope
to
kit
and
the
rest
waited
with
some
curiosity
they
were
very
tired
and
big
drops
fell
on
them
as
the
wind
shook
the
dripping
trees
kit
opened
the
envelope
and
his
face
flushed
as
he
took
out
a
note
addressed
to
hayes
pay
askew
and
the
men
whose
names
follow
one
day
wages
on
estate
account
it
ran
this
was
all
and
the
sum
noted
at
the
bottom
represented
the

handed
the
note
to
his
companions

laughed

can
mend
his
dyke
himsel
said
one
if
five
minutes
digging
wad
save
tarnside
hall
i
sooner
lose
my
hay
than
stir
a
hand
then
they
got
into
the
carts
and
drove
off
in
the
rain
chapter
v
kit
tells
a
story
the
rain
stopped
at
night
the
next
day
was
fine
and
in
the
afternoon
kit
went
up
the
dale
to
look
at
the
mended
dyke
it
had
stood
better
than
he
had
thought
the
beck
was
falling
and
osborn
fields
were
safe
until
another
flood
came
down
kit
did
not
know
if
he
was
pleased
or
not
there
was
some
satisfaction
in
feeling
that
he
had
done
a
good
job
but
he
did
not
think
osborn
deserved
the
help
his
neighbors
had
given
following
the
dyke
until
he
came
to
the
road
he
sat
down
on
the
bridge
and
lighted
his
pipe
the
sun
was
hot
and
he
was
glad
of
the
shade
of
a
big
alder
whose
leaves
rustled
languidly
overhead
the
on
the
hillside
shone
a
warm
yellow
wet
rocks
glittered
like
silver
in
the
strong
light
and
the
higher
slopes
where
belts
of
green
moss
checkered
the
heather
were
streaked
by
lines
of
snowy
foam
all
was
very
quiet
except
for
the
noise
of
running
water
and
the
joyous
notes
of
a
lark
kit
was
not
much
of
a
philosopher
action
was
easier
to
him
than
abstract
thought
but
he
vaguely
felt
that
the
serenity
of
the
dale
was
marred
by
human
passion
man
was
no
doubt
meant
to
struggle
but
nature
was
his
proper
antagonist
and
while
the
fight
against
floods
and
snow
was
bracing
one
gained
nothing
by
shabby
quarrels
that
sprang
from
pride
and
greed
kit
was
human
however
and
owned
that
he
had
felt
savage
when
he
read
osborn
note
the
fellow
had
meant
to
humiliate
him
and
he
got
hot
again
as
he
thought
about
it
moreover
osborn
had
so
to
speak
for
his
sake
insulted
the
men
he
had
persuaded
to
help
they
had
not
worked
for
wages
when
they
fought
the
swollen
beck
and
some
kindly
acknowledgment
such
as
a
supper
at
the
hall
would
have
gone
far
to
gain
for
osborn
a
good
will
that
money
could
not
buy
anyhow
since
he
offered
pay
the
sum
ought
to
have
been
a
just
reward
for
their
toil
osborn
had
been
led
by
personal
rancor
and
there
was
no
use
in
pretending
he
did
not
resent
it
the
fellow
seemed
to
think
he
had
a
right
to
command
and
got
savage
when
people
would
not
obey
kit
felt
he
had
done
nothing
to
deserve
his
hatred
but
since
osborn
did
hate
him
he
must
brace
himself
for
a
struggle
and
he
meant
to
win
then
as
he
knocked
out
his
pipe
he
saw
grace
for
a
few
moments
kit
hesitated
if
grace
knew
how
osborn
had
rewarded
him
the
meeting
might
be
awkward
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
putting
it
off
he
meant
to
marry
grace
whether
osborn
approved
or
not
and
to
some
extent
frankness
was
needful
he
waited
until
she
reached
the
bridge
and
got
up
when
she
stopped
there
was
some
color
in
her
face
but
she
gave
him
a
steady
look
i
have
been
to
see
the
mended
dyke
she
said
and
he
knew
that
she
had
pluck
it
a
rough
job
there
was
no
time
to
finish
it
neatly
i
surprised
you
were
able
to
finish
it
at
all
i
must
claim
all
the
credit
kit
rejoined
smiling
there
were
a
number
of
others
as
well
as
the
tarnside
men
grace
made
an
impatient
gesture
our
men
could
have
done
nothing
useful
if
they
had
been
left
alone
and
the
others
would
have
helped
if
you
had
not
persuaded
them
why
did
you
to
some
extent
my
object
was
selfish
if
the
flood
had
broken
through
it
might
have
done
much
damage
to
all
the
crops
besides
your
father
it
could
not
have
damaged
yours
oh
well
said
kit
i
hate
to
see
things
spoiled
and
am
afraid
meddlesome
grace
color
rose
but
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
that
is
not
kind
i
hardly
think
it
just
i
have
not
accused
you
of
meddling
no
said
kit
i
sorry
it
was
a
stupid
remark
but
i
expect
you
know
what
your
father
thinks
grace
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
she
did
know
and
would
rather
not
have
met
kit
but
was
too
proud
to
turn
back
besides
she
felt
her
father
was
prejudiced
and
although
it
was
a
family
tradition
that
the
osborns
stood
together
she
rebelled
and
wanted
to
be
just
the
situation
was
embarrassing
but
there
was
no
use
in
pretense
i
think
you
were
generous
and
imagine
my
mother
agrees
she
said
she
wanted
to
send
some
lunch
to
the
beck
but
the
rain
was
very
heavy
and
there
was
nobody
to
go
then
remembering
something
osborn
had
said
she
hesitated
i
understand
your
helpers
were
paid
oh
yes
said
kit
not
with
malice
but
because
he
saw
he
must
be
frank
i
was
not
left
out
grace
turned
her
head
this
was
worse
than
she
had
thought
she
was
angry
and
would
not
let
kit
think
she
approved
her
eyes
sparkled
as
she
looked
up
ah
she
said
you
deserved
something
very
different
i
wish
you
had
not
told
me
i
did
tell
you
because
i
was
hurt
kit
replied
with
grave
quietness
it
looks
as
if
we
had
got
to
face
things
your
father
thinks
me
his
enemy
i
not
i
have
never
tried
to
injure
him
and
if
the
dyke
was
threatened
by
another
flood
i
believe
i
mend
it
but
whatever
happens
i
mean
to
do
what
i
think
proper
and
it
possible
we
may
clash
again
yes
said
grace
i
am
afraid
this
may
happen
well
i
value
your
friendship
and
do
mean
to
give
it
up
but
i
pretend
and
think
you
would
be
deceived
if
i
tried
you
mean
you
would
not
do
what
you
thought
was
shabby
in
order
to
avoid
a
clash
i
mean
something
like
that
now
you
know
how
things
are
you
must
choose
your
line
i
ca
judge
how
far
your
duty
to
your
parents
binds
you
you
can
grace
felt
her
heart
beat
and
was
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
i
can
not
criticize
my
father
deeds
and
agree
with
people
who
are
opposed
to
him
she
said
all
the
same
unless
he
expressly
orders
it
i
can
not
give
up
my
friends
kit
tried
to
hide
his
satisfaction
we
let
it
go
i
understand
he
expected
her
to
move
away
and
wondered
whether
it
was
tactful
for
him
to
stop
but
to
his
surprise
she
smiled
and
sat
down
on
the
bridge
very
well
suppose
we
talk
about
something
else
the
shade
is
nice
and
i
need
not
go
home
yet
you
promised
to
tell
me
about
your
adventures
and
your
uncle
i
think
you
called
him
a
survival
from
the
old
romantic
days
when
the
pirates
haunted
the
gulf
of
mexico
kit
pondered
as
he
leaned
against
the
alder
trunk
he
thought
grace
meant
to
banish
the
strain
anyhow
she
was
willing
to
stay
and
he
wanted
her
to
do
so
it
was
strangely
pleasant
to
loiter
on
the
bridge
with
her
while
the
shadows
trembled
on
the
road
and
the
beck
murmured
in
the
shade
but
if
he
meant
to
keep
her
he
must
talk
and
although
he
did
not
want
to
say
much
about
his
adventures
he
had
a
story
to
tell
the
story
was
moving
if
he
could
tell
it
properly
i
not
clever
at
drawing
a
portrait
but
i
like
to
try
he
said
for
one
thing
my
subject
worth
the
effort
and
then
you
see
i
was
fond
of
adam
in
some
ways
he
was
not
romantic
in
fact
he
was
remarkably
practical
his
bold
strokes
were
made
deliberately
after
calculating
the
cost
but
now
and
then
one
got
a
hint
of
something
strangely
romantic
and
in
a
sense
extravagant
yet
human
curious
when
he
played
out
a
losing
game
knowing
he
would
lose
it
was
not
from
sentimental
impulse
but
a
firm
persuasion
it
was
worth
while
he
paused
and
gave
grace
an
apologetic
glance
i
afraid
this
is
rather
foggy
perhaps
i
better
begin
where
i
met
him
at
a
florida
hotel
if
i
not
boring
you
grace
said
she
was
not
bored
and
kit
gaining
confidence
narrated
how
they
bumped
the
across
the
shoals
landed
the
guns
and
met
alvarez
his
own
part
in
their
adventures
was
lightly
indicated
but
the
girl
imagination
supplied
what
he
left
out
she
felt
strangely
interested
as
kit
portrait
of
his
uncle
grew
into
shape
although
her
thoughts
dwelt
largely
on
the
artist
then
the
background
the
steamy
swamp
old
presidio
and
dazzling
town
had
a
romantic
fascination
and
when
he
told
her
about
the
journey
to
the
mission
and
the
church
where
the
candles
that
adam
sent
burned
before
the
virgin
shrine
her
eyes
shone
ah
she
said
i
am
glad
you
told
me
one
thinks
better
of
human
nature
after
hearing
a
tale
like
that
in
a
way
it
a
rebuke
are
such
men
numerous
i
have
known
two
perhaps
it
a
coincidence
that
both
were
my
relations
they
commoner
than
people
think
you
an
optimist
but
one
likes
optimists
grace
remarked
with
a
gentle
smile
however
what
had
the
president
done
to
deserve
the
sacrifice
your
uncle
made
i
never
knew
but
suspect
it
was
something
against
the
laws
of
his
country
if
i
told
my
story
properly
you
would
understand
that
both
were
buccaneers
but
they
had
their
code
i
like
the
president
and
your
uncle
was
very
fine
one
feels
moved
when
one
thinks
about
the
shabby
little
altar
and
the
candles
love
had
lighted
that
never
went
out
all
those
years
wife
loved
him
she
went
to
nurse
him
although
her
friends
warned
her
and
she
knew
the
risk
grace
mused
for
a
time
and
kit
thought
her
face
disturbed
then
she
looked
up
quietly
one
needs
courage
to
know
the
risk
and
not
to
hesitate
but
you
will
keep
those
candles
burning
yes
said
kit
i
promised
besides
i
like
to
think
they
burning
it
means
something
it
means
much
grace
agreed
and
after
a
pause
resumed
you
had
no
doubt
about
taking
up
your
uncle
engagement
with
the
president
although
you
saw
what
it
might
cost
of
course
not
kit
replied
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
grace
smiled
and
got
up
no
she
said
there
was
nothing
else
you
could
do
well
i
must
go
home
kit
went
back
with
her
for
some
distance
they
talked
but
little
on
the
way
but
when
she
left
him
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
a
look
that
made
his
heart
beat
soon
after
grace
reached
tarnside
osborn
crossed
the
lawn
to
the
where
she
and
osborn
sat
beneath
a
spreading
his
face
was
thoughtful
when
osborn
gave
him
a
cup
i
met
the
post
as
i
was
driving
home
he
said
there
a
letter
from
gerald
has
he
any
news
osborn
asked
nothing
important
he
well
and
says
he
kept
occupied
which
is
fortunate
in
fact
the
harder
they
work
him
the
better
i
sooner
gerald
did
not
have
much
time
on
his
hands
then
why
did
he
write
grace
asked
because
gerald
letters
were
by
no
means
regular
i
hope
he
did
not
want
money
osborn
remarked
no
said
osborn
that
is
he
did
not
want
it
for
himself
he
hesitated
and
then
resumed
he
states
that
if
i
could
raise
a
moderate
sum
he
knows
how
we
could
make
a
very
satisfactory
profit
in
a
short
time
it
seems
he
has
got
a
useful
hint
grace
laughed
about
a
racehorse
gerald
is
always
hopeful
but
his
confidence
in
his
ability
to
spot
the
winner
is
dangerous
it
has
been
so
often
misplaced
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
racing
osborn
rejoined
angrily
gerald
knows
the
consequences
of
indulging
his
folly
again
there
a
difference
between
betting
and
buying
shares
i
do
know
if
the
difference
is
very
marked
said
grace
with
a
curious
feeling
of
annoyance
for
there
was
a
note
in
osborn
voice
that
jarred
he
was
like
gerald
a
gambler
greedy
for
money
he
had
not
earned
and
she
thought
about
the
story
kit
had
told
its
hero
had
risked
and
lost
his
life
and
kit
had
paid
in
health
and
fortune
because
they
put
honor
before
gain
for
all
that
she
knew
she
had
said
enough
when
she
saw
osborn
frown
gerald
is
young
but
he
holds
a
responsible
post
and
has
opportunities
of
meeting
important
and
business
men
osborn
went
on
turning
to
his
wife
he
is
of
course
optimistic
and
has
been
rash
but
after
all
he
may
have
found
out
something
useful
he
declares
the
venture
is
absolutely
safe
but
you
have
no
money
to
invest
osborn
insisted
anxiously
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
some
you
see
i
borrowed
a
sum
not
long
since
on
ryecote
oh
said
osborn
with
a
resigned
gesture
and
then
braced
herself
but
if
you
have
got
the
money
it
ought
not
to
be
used
for
speculation
there
is
much
that
needs
to
be
done
on
the
estate
that
is
so
it
was
my
reason
for
borrowing
all
the
same
it
would
be
a
very
long
time
before
i
got
back
what
i
meant
to
spend
on
drains
and
steadings
besides
the
repairs
and
improvements
need
not
be
made
just
yet
and
i
might
be
able
to
use
the
money
and
earn
a
good
profit
first
you
might
lose
it
all
osborn
insisted
gerald
is
rash
and
business
men
do
tell
young
important
secrets
then
although
it
was
a
shock
to
hear
you
had
mortgaged
ryecote
the
money
is
so
badly
needed
that
it
must
not
be
risked
she
paused
and
resumed
with
some
color
in
her
face
it
is
hard
to
own
but
perhaps
gerald
is
not
altogether
to
be
trusted
osborn
moved
abruptly
his
wife
had
touched
the
doubt
that
made
him
hesitate
in
fact
this
was
a
matter
upon
which
he
wanted
her
advice
she
knew
her
son
and
had
judged
right
when
osborn
had
been
deceived
well
he
said
knitting
his
brows
i
have
quite
decided
i
had
thought
about
asking
for
particulars
but
after
all
gerald
hint
may
not
be
worth
much
and
unless
one
is
really
well
informed
speculation
is
dangerous
he
looked
round
and
saw
thorn
the
latter
had
come
up
without
disturbing
the
group
and
now
joined
them
with
a
smile
i
heard
your
last
remark
he
said
my
opinion
is
your
views
are
sound
it
is
very
rash
to
speculate
on
shares
you
do
know
much
about
osborn
felt
disturbed
because
she
wondered
how
much
he
had
heard
but
he
went
on
carelessly
gerald
too
young
for
one
to
trust
his
judgment
my
advice
is
leave
the
thing
alone
grace
gave
him
a
grateful
glance
she
did
not
like
alan
thorn
but
he
was
cautious
and
she
saw
that
osborn
was
hesitating
it
would
not
need
much
persuasion
to
move
him
one
way
or
the
other
and
she
felt
that
to
let
gerald
have
the
money
would
be
a
dangerous
mistake
you
really
think
i
had
better
keep
out
of
it
osborn
asked
certainly
said
thorn
only
a
few
of
the
big
jobbers
can
form
an
accurate
notion
how
prices
ought
to
go
for
people
like
us
speculation
is
a
plunge
in
the
dark
osborn
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
but
grace
saw
that
he
was
pulled
in
different
ways
by
caution
and
greed
then
to
her
relief
he
made
a
sign
of
agreement
oh
well
i
let
the
thing
alone
thorn
sat
down
and
when
osborn
had
given
him
some
tea
they
talked
about
other
matters
presently
grace
got
up
and
he
walked
with
her
across
the
lawn
were
you
satisfied
with
the
advice
i
gave
your
father
he
asked
yes
said
grace
frankly
i
think
he
was
tempted
i
was
glad
you
came
after
all
a
hint
that
he
better
be
prudent
did
not
cost
me
much
you
know
i
do
more
than
that
to
help
you
you
did
all
that
was
necessary
grace
replied
you
have
my
thanks
thorn
glanced
at
her
keenly
but
there
was
something
chilling
in
her
calm
well
i
going
to
london
in
a
day
or
two
and
it
might
be
advisable
to
look
gerald
up
i
will
if
you
like
yes
said
grace
if
it
does
give
you
much
trouble
she
left
him
and
thorn
stood
still
frowning
grace
was
always
like
that
friendly
but
elusive
no
matter
how
he
tried
he
could
not
break
down
her
reserve
chapter
vi
thorn
makes
a
plan
thorn
went
up
to
town
and
one
evening
loitered
about
the
hall
of
his
club
london
rather
bored
him
but
he
went
there
now
and
then
because
he
felt
one
ought
to
keep
in
touch
with
things
it
was
in
a
sense
duty
to
know
what
was
going
on
and
the
news
he
picked
up
helped
him
to
look
well
informed
thorn
had
not
much
imagination
but
he
was
cautious
calculating
and
generally
saw
where
his
advantage
lay
his
small
estate
was
managed
well
in
general
his
tenants
liked
him
and
his
investments
were
sound
nevertheless
he
was
dissatisfied
he
had
waited
long
for
grace
osborn
and
feared
that
in
spite
of
her
father
approval
he
got
no
nearer
her
alan
thorn
was
not
romantic
but
his
love
for
grace
was
to
some
extent
a
generous
emotion
he
knew
osborn
poverty
and
it
was
plain
that
if
he
married
grace
he
might
have
to
help
him
out
of
his
embarrassments
he
was
fond
of
money
and
had
grounds
for
imagining
that
the
daughter
of
a
rich
neighbor
would
not
refuse
him
but
he
wanted
grace
and
saw
he
could
not
wait
much
longer
he
was
fastidious
about
his
clothes
and
their
color
and
loose
cut
prevented
people
remarking
that
he
was
getting
fat
his
dark
hair
was
carefully
brushed
he
knew
however
that
he
was
getting
heavier
fast
and
that
he
would
soon
be
bald
he
had
meant
to
go
out
but
had
no
particular
object
and
the
streets
were
hot
besides
after
the
quiet
country
he
liked
the
bustle
in
the
hall
people
were
beginning
to
come
in
and
one
could
see
the
crowd
stream
past
the
glass
doors
sitting
down
in
a
corner
he
began
to
muse
although
he
had
been
in
town
some
time
he
had
not
seen
gerald
he
had
called
at
the
latter
lodgings
and
found
him
not
at
home
while
when
he
went
to
the
bank
he
was
told
that
gerald
had
been
sent
to
manage
a
small
branch
office
thorn
thought
it
strange
that
osborn
had
said
nothing
about
this
and
wondered
whether
he
knew
gerald
was
extravagant
and
much
less
frank
than
he
looked
he
might
have
had
an
object
for
hiding
his
promotion
thorn
understood
that
osborn
made
him
some
allowance
but
it
was
hard
to
see
how
the
young
man
was
able
to
belong
to
his
rather
expensive
club
after
a
time
gerald
came
in
and
glanced
at
two
or
three
men
who
stood
about
at
first
thorn
imagined
he
was
looking
for
him
but
saw
he
was
not
gerald
went
into
the
telephone
box
close
by
and
shut
the
door
with
a
jerky
movement
it
jarred
and
then
swung
back
a
few
inches
as
if
the
shock
had
jolted
the
spring
thorn
whose
curiosity
was
excited
listened
and
heard
the
number
gerald
asked
for
then
he
heard
him
say
yes
osborn
is
that
sanderson
yes
i
said
any
chance
of
a
recovery
what
none
at
all
ca
hear
oh
sell
at
once
margin
gone
next
moment
gerald
obviously
saw
that
the
door
was
open
for
he
banged
it
noisily
and
thorn
heard
nothing
more
he
had
however
heard
enough
to
give
him
food
for
thought
and
waited
until
gerald
came
out
the
young
man
stood
still
with
his
mouth
firmly
set
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
wall
as
if
he
saw
nobody
his
clothes
were
in
the
latest
fashion
but
the
look
of
fastidious
languidness
that
generally
marked
him
had
gone
turning
abruptly
he
went
up
the
stairs
and
thorn
entered
the
telephone
box
and
opened
the
directory
when
he
came
out
he
went
up
to
a
man
he
knew
can
you
tell
me
anything
about
short
and
sanderson
stockbrokers
he
asked
not
much
said
the
other
they
outside
brokers
i
imagine
trustworthy
but
it
better
to
do
business
through
a
member
of
the
exchange
you
find
it
a
good
rule
thank
you
said
thorn
who
went
upstairs
to
the
and
found
gerald
sitting
in
front
of
a
table
with
a
newspaper
that
dealt
with
financial
matters
hallo
said
thorn
i
have
been
expecting
you
for
some
days
i
suppose
you
got
my
message
gerald
looked
up
and
his
smile
was
strained
i
did
but
have
been
much
engaged
sit
down
and
join
me
in
a
drink
what
have
you
ordered
thorn
asked
and
shrugged
when
gerald
told
him
that
goes
better
after
dinner
i
sooner
have
something
cool
and
light
oh
well
said
gerald
i
felt
i
needed
bracing
the
fact
is
i
had
a
knock
he
stopped
as
a
waiter
came
up
and
said
nothing
until
the
man
had
gone
then
he
drained
his
glass
and
turned
to
thorn
i
in
a
hole
can
you
lend
me
two
thousand
pounds
thorn
hid
his
surprise
he
thought
urgent
need
had
forced
gerald
to
make
his
blunt
request
it
was
not
his
way
to
plunge
at
things
like
that
you
asked
your
father
for
a
smaller
sum
they
told
you
about
my
letter
well
things
have
changed
since
changed
for
the
worse
they
must
have
changed
rather
quickly
thorn
remarked
for
his
suspicion
was
excited
and
he
thought
he
saw
a
light
gerald
had
been
embarrassed
when
he
wrote
to
osborn
and
had
not
wanted
the
money
to
invest
but
to
help
him
to
escape
the
consequences
of
some
extravagance
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
gerald
rejoined
will
you
let
me
have
the
money
you
can
if
you
like
to
begin
with
you
had
better
tell
me
why
you
want
so
large
a
sum
gerald
hesitated
and
his
eyelids
twitched
nervously
but
he
pulled
himself
together
and
thorn
wondered
how
far
he
would
stick
to
the
truth
he
knew
gerald
and
did
not
trust
him
very
well
i
bought
some
shares
there
was
good
ground
for
expecting
they
go
up
they
went
down
when
did
you
buy
your
meaning
plain
said
gerald
sullenly
if
you
insist
it
was
before
i
wrote
home
i
suspected
something
like
that
however
you
have
the
shares
and
they
may
go
up
again
i
have
got
the
shares
i
bought
on
a
margin
and
the
margin
gone
then
you
rasher
than
i
thought
thorn
rejoined
with
a
searching
look
well
you
have
lost
your
money
and
it
something
of
a
surprise
to
hear
you
had
so
much
anyhow
it
was
yours
and
although
the
loss
is
serious
i
do
understand
how
you
embarrassed
i
borrowed
said
gerald
rather
hoarsely
you
can
wait
the
other
fellow
wo
then
of
course
if
i
renewed
the
margin
the
shares
might
recover
and
put
me
straight
thorn
pondered
gerald
statement
was
plausible
but
he
doubted
if
he
had
told
him
all
two
thousand
pounds
is
a
large
sum
he
said
i
do
know
yet
if
i
can
lend
it
you
gerald
gave
him
a
steady
look
his
face
was
haggard
and
the
sweat
ran
down
his
forehead
it
was
obvious
that
he
was
desperate
if
you
hope
to
marry
my
sister
you
had
better
help
me
out
i
have
much
ground
for
thinking
your
sister
will
agree
thorn
rejoined
with
some
dryness
anyhow
it
doubtful
if
your
influence
would
go
far
with
her
if
that
is
what
you
mean
it
is
not
what
i
mean
gerald
answered
in
a
hoarse
voice
i
have
given
you
a
useful
hint
you
can
spare
two
thousand
pounds
and
if
you
let
me
have
the
money
you
be
glad
you
did
i
must
think
about
it
you
can
call
me
up
on
the
telephone
at
noon
gerald
hesitated
and
then
made
an
abrupt
movement
as
a
man
came
into
the
room
the
latter
crossed
the
floor
and
gerald
got
up
very
well
he
said
and
went
off
soon
after
gerald
had
gone
the
man
thorn
had
met
in
the
hall
came
in
and
he
asked
do
you
know
anything
about
norton
i
suppose
they
mining
shares
i
would
advise
you
to
invest
the
other
replied
the
company
has
seldom
paid
a
dividend
but
not
long
since
a
rumor
got
about
that
a
new
shaft
had
bottomed
on
rich
he
paused
and
shrugged
nobody
knows
how
such
tales
are
started
but
they
appeal
to
optimistic
outsiders
who
like
to
think
they
got
a
secret
tip
anyhow
there
was
some
reckless
buying
by
people
who
expected
developments
at
the
shareholders
meeting
they
were
disappointed
and
are
knocking
prices
down
by
their
anxiety
to
sell
out
thorn
thanked
him
and
began
to
think
he
wondered
where
gerald
had
managed
to
get
two
thousand
pounds
since
he
imagined
that
nobody
would
lend
him
the
sum
he
did
not
know
much
about
banking
but
it
was
possible
that
gerald
had
used
his
employers
money
hoping
to
replace
it
before
he
was
found
out
then
since
two
thousand
pounds
used
for
a
margin
would
cover
a
large
number
of
shares
it
looked
as
if
gerald
had
lost
part
of
the
sum
by
previous
speculations
while
he
pondered
the
man
whose
entry
had
seemed
to
disturb
gerald
came
to
his
table
and
sat
down
opposite
you
obviously
know
young
osborn
he
remarked
thorn
said
nothing
for
a
moment
or
two
hallam
was
not
a
public
but
sometimes
negotiated
private
loans
for
extravagant
young
men
about
town
one
meets
such
people
now
and
then
at
smart
london
clubs
and
thorn
imagined
the
fellow
could
throw
some
light
on
difficulties
we
come
from
the
same
neighborhood
he
replied
his
father
is
a
large
landowner
i
believe
he
has
some
land
said
thorn
who
began
to
see
his
way
he
had
not
yet
decided
to
help
gerald
but
if
he
did
his
help
must
be
made
as
valuable
as
possible
the
rents
are
low
and
the
estate
is
encumbered
he
resumed
on
the
whole
i
do
think
you
would
consider
it
good
security
thank
you
for
the
hint
osborn
looked
as
if
he
had
got
a
jar
i
think
he
had
he
bought
some
shares
that
have
gone
down
sharply
and
since
he
a
i
expect
the
loss
is
a
serious
thing
for
him
hallam
nodded
carelessly
no
doubt
do
you
know
a
man
called
askew
i
know
something
about
him
he
owns
a
farm
in
the
dale
and
has
recently
spent
some
money
on
improvements
although
it
doubtful
if
he
get
much
return
i
ca
tell
you
if
he
has
any
more
or
not
but
imagine
not
worth
your
bothering
about
besides
he
not
the
man
i
expect
to
get
into
debt
askew
has
not
been
trying
to
borrow
hallam
answered
with
a
smile
well
i
promised
to
meet
a
friend
and
must
stop
he
went
away
and
thorn
sat
still
pondering
the
other
men
went
out
by
and
by
and
the
room
was
quiet
except
for
the
rumble
of
traffic
in
the
street
and
the
rattle
of
an
electric
fan
a
waiter
pulled
down
a
blind
to
shut
out
a
bright
sunbeam
and
thorn
found
the
shade
and
softened
noises
from
outside
helpful
to
thought
gerald
had
used
money
belonging
to
the
bank
and
borrowed
from
hallam
in
order
to
pay
it
back
although
thorn
could
not
see
what
had
persuaded
the
latter
to
lend
it
was
strange
certainly
that
hallam
had
inquired
about
askew
but
in
the
meantime
he
could
let
this
go
gerald
was
threatened
by
a
danger
money
could
avert
and
thorn
could
help
if
he
did
help
it
would
give
him
a
claim
to
osborn
gratitude
although
he
could
not
tell
how
far
this
would
influence
grace
the
osborns
cherished
the
traditions
of
their
class
and
anything
that
touched
one
touched
all
grace
however
was
modern
and
rebellious
and
thorn
knew
she
did
not
like
him
much
he
was
not
afraid
to
risk
his
money
but
he
must
not
waste
an
opportunity
he
might
not
get
again
and
the
opportunity
could
be
used
in
one
of
two
ways
he
could
free
gerald
from
his
entanglements
and
using
no
pressure
leave
her
parents
gratitude
to
work
on
grace
this
was
the
proper
line
and
would
enable
him
to
play
a
generous
part
had
he
been
younger
he
would
not
have
hesitated
but
he
saw
a
risk
he
was
beginning
to
look
old
and
unless
grace
married
him
soon
must
give
her
up
the
other
line
although
not
attractive
promised
greater
security
before
he
helped
he
must
state
his
terms
and
force
osborn
to
agree
grace
could
not
struggle
because
her
refusal
would
involve
the
family
in
gerald
disgrace
thorn
saw
the
plan
had
drawbacks
but
grace
was
young
and
if
he
indulged
and
petted
her
she
would
no
doubt
get
to
like
him
and
forget
his
hardness
he
had
heard
of
marriages
made
like
this
that
turned
out
happily
for
a
time
he
sat
with
his
brows
knitted
and
his
mouth
set
he
would
have
liked
to
be
generous
but
he
loved
the
girl
and
could
not
force
himself
to
run
the
risk
of
losing
her
nevertheless
he
honestly
tried
and
afterwards
remembered
with
strange
distinctness
the
soft
rattle
of
the
electric
fan
and
the
dull
roll
of
traffic
that
throbbed
in
the
quiet
room
while
he
fought
the
losing
fight
the
sunbeam
the
waiter
had
shut
out
crept
on
to
another
window
and
shone
on
the
fluted
pillars
before
he
got
up
his
face
was
very
hard
for
he
had
chosen
his
line
and
knew
he
must
take
it
without
doubt
or
pity
going
down
to
the
hall
he
called
up
gerald
branch
bank
a
clerk
who
was
working
late
replied
that
osborn
had
gone
i
know
said
thorn
giving
his
name
make
a
note
to
tell
him
he
need
not
call
on
me
i
find
i
am
unable
to
do
what
he
requires
very
well
said
the
clerk
i
give
him
the
message
in
the
morning
thorn
rang
the
bell
and
leaving
the
box
asked
for
a
railway
guide
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
stopping
in
london
and
he
looked
up
the
best
train
for
the
north
chapter
vii
gerald
return
thorn
went
home
and
waited
confident
that
osborn
would
presently
send
for
him
the
estate
was
heavily
mortgaged
osborn
had
no
rich
friends
and
when
the
blow
fell
would
look
to
thorn
for
the
aid
nobody
else
could
give
in
the
meantime
osborn
enjoying
a
short
relief
from
financial
strain
squandered
in
personal
extravagance
part
of
the
sum
he
had
borrowed
and
then
set
drainers
carpenters
and
builders
to
work
he
liked
spending
and
now
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
the
money
he
was
laying
out
would
give
him
some
return
it
ought
to
last
until
he
had
finished
the
renovations
his
tenants
demanded
and
although
difficulties
might
arise
afterwards
he
would
wait
until
they
did
indeed
his
wife
and
daughter
found
him
better
humored
than
he
had
been
for
long
then
one
evening
when
the
hay
was
harvested
and
the
corn
was
ripening
his
satisfaction
was
rudely
banished
grace
had
gone
to
the
lodge
with
a
message
and
stopped
for
a
few
minutes
by
the
gate
the
evening
was
calm
and
one
side
of
the
placid
tarn
glittered
in
the
light
the
other
was
dark
and
soft
blue
shadows
covered
the
fells
behind
she
heard
the
languid
splash
of
ripples
on
the
stones
and
the
murmur
of
a
beck
in
a
distant
ghyll
a
strange
restful
tranquillity
brooded
over
the
dale
grace
felt
the
calm
soothing
for
her
thoughts
were
not
a
little
disturbed
she
had
met
thorn
in
the
afternoon
and
noted
a
puzzling
change
in
his
manner
so
far
she
had
been
able
to
check
his
cautious
advances
but
she
now
remarked
a
new
confidence
that
seemed
to
indicate
he
had
some
power
in
reserve
she
admitted
that
she
might
have
imagined
this
but
it
troubled
her
afterwards
she
had
met
kit
and
the
comfort
the
meeting
gave
her
had
forced
her
to
think
their
friendship
had
gone
far
in
fact
it
had
reached
a
point
friendship
could
not
pass
kit
was
not
yet
her
lover
but
she
thought
he
waited
for
a
sign
that
she
would
acknowledge
him
when
he
made
his
claim
she
liked
kit
she
had
not
met
a
man
she
liked
so
much
this
however
did
not
imply
that
she
was
willing
to
marry
him
although
she
now
and
then
rebelled
against
conventions
she
had
inherited
some
of
osborn
prejudices
and
her
mother
sprang
from
stock
kit
belonged
to
another
class
the
life
he
led
was
different
she
had
been
taught
to
enjoy
cultivated
idleness
broken
by
outdoor
sports
and
social
amusements
but
kit
was
a
worker
farming
for
money
and
resolved
to
make
his
efforts
pay
his
wife
must
help
and
grace
did
not
know
if
this
daunted
her
or
not
moreover
if
she
married
kit
she
must
quarrel
with
her
parents
she
knew
what
osborn
thought
about
him
had
she
been
sure
she
loved
kit
the
choice
would
have
been
easier
but
although
she
blushed
as
she
mused
this
was
too
much
to
own
yet
he
loved
her
and
after
all
she
let
the
matter
go
and
looked
up
for
there
were
steps
in
the
shadowy
road
then
a
figure
came
into
the
fading
light
and
she
started
and
ran
to
the
gate
gerald
she
exclaimed
why
have
you
come
home
somehow
you
do
feel
flattered
when
people
ask
you
why
you
came
gerald
rejoined
with
a
forced
smile
it
rather
indicates
surprise
than
satisfaction
i
am
surprised
grace
admitted
trying
to
hide
her
vague
alarm
we
did
not
expect
you
how
did
you
getaway
i
took
a
week
leave
i
have
been
very
fit
grace
gave
him
a
sharp
glance
and
thought
he
looked
his
face
was
pinched
his
eyes
were
furtive
and
his
mouth
was
slack
what
has
been
the
matter
she
asked
nothing
very
much
gerald
replied
mental
strain
i
expect
managing
a
bank
is
a
big
job
and
i
not
used
to
responsibility
it
looked
as
if
his
carelessness
cost
him
an
effort
and
grace
said
nothing
when
they
reached
the
house
gerald
resumed
you
hear
all
about
it
later
is
the
chief
at
home
grace
nodded
they
had
seldom
called
osborn
father
but
chief
and
head
of
the
clan
and
she
thought
it
significant
that
gerald
used
the
name
he
often
falteringly
employed
after
boyish
escapades
she
began
to
feel
that
there
was
something
wrong
he
in
the
library
she
said
that
satisfactory
as
far
as
it
goes
gerald
remarked
climbing
the
steps
the
sooner
i
see
him
the
sooner
i
get
through
the
thing
he
paused
and
gave
grace
an
anxious
glance
you
stand
by
me
you
generally
did
i
suppose
so
grace
agreed
but
i
do
know
your
difficulties
and
what
you
want
you
will
know
soon
gerald
rejoined
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
it
an
awkward
business
i
got
to
brace
up
he
left
her
and
went
to
the
library
where
osborn
sat
at
the
big
oak
table
with
some
letters
and
a
wine
glass
in
front
of
him
the
spacious
room
was
mostly
in
shadow
but
a
ray
of
fading
light
shone
in
through
the
tall
west
window
gerald
avoided
the
illumination
as
he
advanced
and
stopped
in
the
gloom
opposite
osborn
who
straightened
his
body
with
a
jerk
and
upset
the
glass
well
he
said
harshly
why
have
you
left
the
bank
the
wine
is
running
across
the
table
and
on
to
your
clothes
shall
i
ring
no
said
osborn
pushing
his
chair
back
noisily
let
it
run
stand
still
or
sit
down
tell
me
why
you
came
to
begin
with
i
have
left
the
bank
for
good
ah
said
osborn
grimly
i
suspected
something
like
this
you
mean
they
turned
you
out
well
you
are
consistent
in
your
habits
you
left
school
in
similar
circumstances
you
left
woolwich
and
now
i
was
not
turned
out
sir
they
gave
me
a
week
leave
but
i
ca
go
back
osborn
frowned
things
had
been
going
well
and
he
had
thought
himself
free
from
trouble
for
a
time
but
it
looked
as
if
he
would
get
his
worst
jar
he
tried
to
preserve
his
calm
and
said
with
a
touch
of
weariness
tell
me
what
has
happened
and
keep
as
near
the
truth
as
is
possible
for
you
gerald
told
him
standing
back
in
the
shadow
and
not
pausing
to
choose
his
words
it
was
an
ugly
story
that
could
not
be
toned
down
and
he
knew
if
he
stopped
he
could
not
go
on
again
although
osborn
said
nothing
his
face
got
red
and
the
veins
on
his
forehead
swelled
and
gerald
found
his
silence
strangely
daunting
when
the
latter
stopped
osborn
got
up
and
stood
rather
shakily
with
his
hand
clenched
get
out
of
my
sight
you
despicable
thief
he
cried
my
control
is
going
if
you
stand
and
fidget
there
i
knock
you
down
there
would
be
much
use
in
that
although
i
deserve
it
gerald
replied
it
too
late
for
excuses
the
situation
dangerous
you
have
got
to
help
me
out
i
ca
help
said
osborn
in
a
strained
hoarse
voice
why
did
you
leave
the
country
instead
of
coming
home
gerald
forced
a
nervous
smile
the
reason
ought
to
be
obvious
sir
i
might
be
brought
back
we
must
get
over
the
need
for
me
to
go
you
see
the
bill
must
be
met
if
it
dishonored
everybody
who
knows
us
will
have
something
to
talk
about
i
thought
you
a
fool
said
osborn
bitterly
you
are
a
fool
but
you
have
a
vein
of
devilish
cunning
you
steal
and
forge
and
then
expect
to
shuffle
off
the
consequences
on
to
your
relatives
he
pulled
himself
up
for
gerald
coolness
was
steadying
however
i
must
understand
what
will
happen
when
the
lender
finds
you
can
not
pay
the
usual
course
would
be
for
him
to
go
to
the
endorser
gerald
replied
and
added
with
some
awkwardness
i
mean
the
man
whose
name
i
used
his
signature
a
guarantee
and
makes
him
liable
still
as
hallam
a
tactful
fellow
it
possible
he
first
come
to
you
do
you
mean
he
suspicious
i
do
know
he
took
off
an
extortionate
discount
for
a
very
short
loan
how
much
did
he
lend
you
the
bill
was
for
two
thousand
pounds
osborn
made
a
helpless
gesture
i
ca
pay
the
money
i
borrowed
is
partly
spent
and
the
rest
must
go
for
wages
and
material
you
ca
put
wages
off
he
stopped
and
sat
down
limply
the
shock
was
beginning
to
tell
he
felt
dull
and
had
no
reserve
of
moral
strength
to
sustain
him
now
his
fury
had
gone
gerald
saw
this
and
knew
that
guidance
must
come
from
him
he
waited
however
and
osborn
went
on
it
ridiculous
that
we
should
be
ruined
for
two
thousand
pounds
but
there
it
is
if
i
try
to
borrow
from
my
friends
i
must
tell
why
i
need
the
money
and
i
do
know
who
would
lend
thorn
might
gerald
suggested
meaningly
i
asked
him
and
he
would
but
i
do
think
his
refusal
was
final
ah
said
osborn
with
a
start
why
do
you
think
it
was
not
i
imagine
he
has
another
plan
he
means
to
wait
until
it
obvious
we
must
have
his
help
then
he
can
ask
what
he
likes
for
a
moment
osborn
anger
blazed
up
again
i
see
where
you
are
leading
you
contemptible
cur
you
expect
your
sister
to
pay
for
you
it
would
be
a
good
marriage
said
gerald
awkwardly
i
thought
you
wanted
it
stop
exclaimed
osborn
and
rested
his
elbows
on
the
table
with
his
shoulders
bent
he
had
wanted
grace
to
marry
thorn
but
his
domineering
temper
did
not
carry
him
as
far
as
gerald
thought
he
had
hoped
that
by
and
by
grace
would
consent
it
was
ridiculous
to
imagine
she
would
long
refuse
to
see
the
advantages
that
were
plain
to
him
but
to
force
her
to
pay
for
her
brother
fault
was
another
thing
although
grace
was
rebellious
he
had
some
love
for
her
in
fact
he
revolted
from
the
plan
and
felt
he
hated
thorn
for
the
pressure
he
could
use
he
was
nearly
resigned
to
letting
things
go
and
facing
the
threatened
disaster
for
a
minute
or
two
he
did
not
move
and
gerald
got
horribly
cramped
as
he
stood
opposite
the
room
was
getting
dark
and
osborn
figure
was
indistinct
but
his
quietness
hinted
at
a
struggle
gerald
began
to
feel
anxious
because
he
had
not
expected
his
father
to
hesitate
at
length
osborn
looked
up
you
have
told
me
whose
name
you
used
askew
said
gerald
with
a
tremor
he
knew
he
could
use
no
stronger
argument
but
felt
afraid
askew
shouted
osborn
straightening
his
bent
shoulders
with
a
savage
jerk
this
is
more
than
i
can
bear
was
there
nobody
you
could
rob
but
the
man
who
has
plotted
against
me
since
he
came
home
from
school
he
stopped
and
gasped
as
if
his
rage
were
choking
him
and
it
was
some
moments
before
he
went
on
you
have
given
the
fellow
power
to
humble
us
and
drag
our
name
in
the
mud
ca
you
imagine
how
he
exult
our
honor
in
askew
hands
it
unthinkable
if
the
bill
is
met
the
holder
will
apply
to
askew
gerald
said
as
coolly
as
he
could
osborn
muscles
relaxed
and
he
sank
back
into
his
limp
pose
his
hand
shook
as
he
wiped
his
wet
forehead
you
have
said
enough
leave
me
alone
i
must
try
to
think
gerald
went
out
and
drew
a
deep
breath
when
he
reached
the
landing
he
felt
shaky
and
ashamed
but
knew
he
had
won
the
shutting
of
the
door
gave
osborn
some
relief
the
anger
and
disgust
gerald
excited
had
confused
his
brain
but
now
the
lad
had
gone
he
saw
no
light
there
was
but
one
way
of
escape
and
this
a
way
it
was
almost
unthinkable
that
he
should
take
the
strange
thing
was
he
should
hate
it
so
much
for
he
had
never
indulged
his
children
or
thought
about
their
happiness
yet
he
shrank
from
forcing
his
daughter
to
marry
thorn
whom
he
approved
while
she
did
not
he
might
perhaps
for
the
girl
sake
have
sacrificed
his
pride
but
there
was
an
obstacle
before
which
his
courage
melted
if
thorn
did
not
help
askew
would
know
his
disgrace
and
osborn
did
not
expect
him
to
be
merciful
his
rancor
against
askew
had
by
degrees
become
a
blind
illogical
hate
that
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
see
anything
kit
did
in
its
proper
light
feeling
as
he
did
he
imagined
kit
would
rejoice
in
the
opportunity
for
humbling
him
all
the
same
knowing
the
fight
was
hopeless
he
struggled
against
the
conviction
that
he
must
beg
help
from
thorn
in
many
ways
he
liked
alan
but
he
was
hard
and
osborn
dreaded
his
firmness
now
yet
he
could
help
and
there
was
nobody
else
it
got
dark
but
osborn
did
not
move
a
faint
breeze
came
up
and
moaned
about
the
house
and
presently
a
moonbeam
stole
into
the
room
osborn
sat
still
with
his
head
bent
and
his
arms
spread
out
across
the
table
sometimes
he
burned
with
anger
against
gerald
and
sometimes
he
scarcely
felt
anything
at
all
at
length
he
got
up
and
with
an
effort
went
upstairs
half
an
hour
later
a
heavy
sleep
that
came
as
a
reaction
after
the
shock
closed
his
eyes
and
banished
his
troubles
for
a
time
chapter
viii
grace
confidence
on
the
day
after
gerald
return
osborn
shut
himself
up
in
his
library
if
he
could
raise
two
thousand
pounds
it
would
save
him
from
agreeing
to
the
demand
thorn
would
no
doubt
make
and
although
he
really
knew
the
thing
was
impossible
he
sought
desperately
for
a
way
of
escape
he
was
careless
about
money
and
for
the
most
part
left
his
business
to
his
agent
but
he
wanted
to
find
out
how
he
stood
before
he
went
to
hayes
there
was
no
obvious
reason
for
his
doing
so
but
he
had
begun
to
suspect
that
hayes
was
not
as
devoted
to
his
interests
as
he
had
thought
his
wife
and
grace
distrusted
the
fellow
and
although
they
knew
nothing
about
business
osborn
admitted
that
the
advice
they
had
sometimes
given
him
had
been
sound
the
involved
calculations
he
made
gave
him
fresh
ground
for
disturbance
it
was
plain
that
he
could
borrow
no
more
money
and
the
sum
he
had
received
for
the
last
mortgage
had
nearly
gone
he
might
perhaps
get
together
three
or
four
hundred
pounds
at
the
risk
of
letting
builders
and
drainers
go
unpaid
but
this
was
not
enough
after
a
time
he
put
away
his
books
in
a
fit
of
hopeless
anger
and
drove
across
to
see
hayes
at
the
market
town
the
interview
was
short
and
disappointing
osborn
could
not
tell
hayes
why
he
needed
money
and
found
him
unusually
firm
he
proved
that
the
estate
was
heavily
overburdened
fresh
loans
were
impossible
and
stern
economy
must
be
used
if
it
was
to
be
saved
from
bankruptcy
to
some
extent
osborn
had
expected
this
but
had
cherished
a
faint
hope
that
hayes
might
lend
him
enough
to
satisfy
gerald
creditor
he
could
not
force
himself
to
ask
for
a
loan
outright
and
hayes
had
been
strangely
dull
about
his
cautious
hints
osborn
believed
the
fellow
could
have
helped
him
but
as
he
had
shown
no
wish
to
do
so
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
he
drove
home
in
a
downcast
mood
and
sent
for
gerald
i
ca
get
the
money
he
said
you
know
the
man
you
dealt
with
is
there
any
hope
of
his
renewing
the
bill
i
afraid
there
is
none
sir
gerald
replied
when
he
made
the
loan
he
knew
you
were
a
and
had
no
money
i
expect
he
did
know
but
thought
you
had
some
osborn
sighed
his
anger
had
gone
and
a
dull
hopeless
dejection
had
taken
its
place
he
felt
as
if
he
and
gerald
were
accomplices
in
a
plot
against
grace
and
did
not
resent
the
lad
insinuation
that
they
stood
together
the
osborns
did
stand
together
and
he
hoped
grace
would
see
her
duty
well
he
said
the
payment
is
not
due
just
yet
i
wait
a
little
and
then
write
to
the
fellow
it
was
a
relief
to
put
the
thing
off
but
he
found
no
comfort
as
the
days
went
by
and
although
he
shrank
from
taking
osborn
into
his
confidence
his
moody
humor
gave
her
a
hint
besides
he
was
not
clever
at
keeping
a
secret
and
now
and
then
made
illuminating
remarks
osborn
although
reserved
was
shrewd
and
she
and
grace
without
consulting
each
other
speculated
about
the
trouble
that
obviously
threatened
the
house
by
degrees
their
conjectures
got
near
the
truth
and
at
length
osborn
nerved
herself
to
ask
her
husband
a
few
blunt
questions
he
had
not
meant
to
tell
her
all
until
he
was
forced
but
was
taken
off
his
guard
and
told
her
much
afterwards
she
sent
for
grace
when
grace
heard
the
story
her
face
got
very
white
and
she
looked
at
her
mother
with
fear
in
her
eyes
i
suspected
something
but
this
is
worse
than
i
thought
she
said
in
a
low
strained
voice
but
alan
is
an
old
friend
it
is
not
very
much
for
him
to
do
and
perhaps
he
will
be
generous
osborn
was
sitting
rather
limply
on
the
stone
bench
on
the
terrace
but
she
roused
herself
he
is
hard
and
i
think
will
understand
what
his
help
is
worth
he
knows
there
is
nobody
else
besides
if
we
accept
this
favor
we
can
not
refuse
oh
said
grace
it
unbearable
i
never
liked
alan
i
feel
i
hate
him
now
she
paused
and
gave
osborn
an
appealing
glance
but
you
can
not
think
i
ought
to
agree
mother
there
must
be
another
way
osborn
shook
her
head
i
can
not
see
another
way
and
many
girls
in
our
class
have
married
men
they
did
not
like
though
i
had
hoped
for
a
better
lot
for
you
with
us
women
do
not
count
the
interests
of
the
family
come
first
that
means
the
men
interests
grace
broke
out
father
has
been
reckless
all
his
life
and
now
gerald
has
dragged
our
name
in
the
mud
he
is
to
be
saved
from
the
consequences
and
i
must
pay
it
is
unjust
osborn
agreed
so
far
as
that
goes
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
but
when
one
thinks
of
the
disgrace
gerald
hiding
in
america
or
perhaps
in
prison
her
voice
broke
she
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
then
resumed
your
father
is
the
conventional
point
of
view
that
i
was
taught
to
accept
but
which
i
begin
to
doubt
i
must
choose
between
my
daughter
and
my
son
the
son
who
carries
on
the
house
if
gerald
escapes
his
punishment
falls
on
you
the
choice
is
almost
too
hard
for
flesh
and
blood
i
know
said
grace
with
quick
sympathy
it
is
horrible
well
said
osborn
the
line
i
ought
to
take
is
plain
tarnside
will
be
gerald
our
honor
must
be
saved
but
i
do
not
know
if
you
shrink
from
alan
if
he
insists
i
shall
hate
him
always
yet
it
looks
as
if
there
was
no
use
in
rebelling
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
caught
in
a
snare
that
tightens
when
i
try
to
break
loose
i
understand
why
a
rabbit
screams
and
struggles
until
it
chokes
when
it
feels
the
wire
like
that
with
me
osborn
bent
her
head
my
dear
my
dear
then
she
looked
up
irresolutely
with
tears
in
her
eyes
i
can
not
see
my
duty
as
i
thought
the
convention
is
that
my
son
should
come
first
but
you
are
nearer
to
me
than
gerald
has
been
for
long
i
feel
numb
and
dull
i
can
not
think
perhaps
i
may
see
grace
got
up
and
kissed
her
then
we
will
wait
if
no
help
comes
i
suppose
i
must
submit
she
went
away
with
a
languid
step
and
osborn
sinking
back
in
a
corner
of
the
bench
looked
across
the
lawn
with
vacant
eyes
in
a
sense
she
had
shirked
her
duty
and
failed
her
husband
but
she
had
long
given
way
to
him
and
was
now
beginning
to
rebel
grace
afterwards
looked
back
with
horror
on
the
disturbed
evening
and
sleepless
night
and
the
morning
brought
her
no
relief
she
could
not
resign
herself
to
the
sacrifice
she
thought
she
would
be
forced
to
make
and
her
mother
told
her
that
osborn
had
sent
a
note
to
thorn
and
a
man
from
london
would
arrive
in
the
evening
it
was
plain
that
alan
must
be
persuaded
to
help
gerald
before
the
other
came
in
the
afternoon
she
walked
up
the
dale
without
an
object
because
it
was
impossible
to
stop
in
the
house
after
a
time
she
heard
a
dog
bark
and
stopping
by
an
open
gate
saw
kit
swinging
a
scythe
where
an
old
thorn
hedge
threw
its
shadow
on
a
field
of
corn
he
was
cutting
a
path
for
the
binder
and
for
a
minute
or
two
she
stood
and
watched
kit
had
taken
off
his
jacket
and
his
thin
blue
shirt
harmonized
with
the
warm
yellow
of
the
corn
and
the
color
of
his
sunburnt
skin
the
thin
material
showed
the
fine
modeling
of
his
figure
as
his
body
followed
the
sweep
of
the
gleaming
scythe
the
forward
stoop
and
recovery
were
marked
by
a
rhythmic
grace
and
the
crackle
of
the
hinted
at
his
strength
his
face
was
calm
and
grace
saw
his
mind
dwelt
upon
his
work
he
looked
honest
clean
and
virile
but
she
turned
her
head
and
struggled
with
a
poignant
sense
of
loss
she
knew
now
what
it
would
cost
her
to
let
him
go
then
his
dog
ran
up
and
kit
putting
down
his
scythe
came
to
the
gate
he
gave
her
a
searching
glance
but
she
was
calm
again
and
began
to
talk
about
the
harvest
he
did
not
seem
to
listen
and
when
she
stopped
said
abruptly
you
are
standing
in
the
sun
come
into
the
shade
i
make
you
a
seat
she
went
with
him
knowing
this
was
imprudent
but
unable
to
resist
and
he
threw
an
against
the
bank
and
covered
it
with
his
coat
grace
sat
down
and
he
studied
her
thoughtfully
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
the
matter
he
said
how
do
you
know
i
have
anything
to
tell
perhaps
it
sympathy
instinct
or
something
like
that
anyhow
i
do
know
and
you
may
feel
better
when
you
have
told
me
it
now
and
then
a
relief
to
talk
about
one
troubles
grace
was
silent
her
heart
beat
fast
and
she
longed
for
his
sympathy
and
his
nearness
gave
her
a
feeling
of
support
but
she
could
not
tell
him
all
her
trouble
he
waited
with
a
patience
that
somehow
indicated
understanding
and
she
looked
about
the
tall
oats
rippled
before
the
wind
and
soft
shadows
trailed
across
the
hillside
when
the
white
clouds
passed
the
dale
was
filled
with
light
that
jarred
her
hopelessness
as
you
have
begun
yet
i
make
a
guess
said
kit
things
have
been
going
wrong
at
tarnside
since
gerald
came
home
well
if
you
can
give
me
a
few
particulars
it
possible
i
can
help
his
steady
glance
was
comforting
and
grace
reserve
gave
way
it
was
humiliating
and
in
a
sense
disloyal
to
talk
about
gerald
but
her
pride
had
gone
and
she
was
suddenly
inspired
by
a
strange
confidence
perhaps
kit
could
help
one
could
trust
him
and
he
was
not
the
man
to
be
daunted
by
obstacles
yes
she
said
vaguely
it
gerald
so
i
thought
kit
remarked
very
well
you
had
better
tell
me
all
you
know
or
anyhow
all
you
can
she
gave
him
a
quick
glance
to
see
what
he
meant
but
his
brown
face
was
inscrutable
and
with
an
effort
talking
fast
in
order
to
finish
before
her
courage
failed
she
narrated
what
she
had
heard
she
could
not
of
course
tell
him
all
and
indeed
osborn
story
left
much
to
be
explained
ah
said
kit
i
begin
to
see
a
light
although
the
thing
not
quite
plain
yet
anyhow
your
father
needs
money
and
must
ask
his
friends
he
paused
and
resumed
in
a
voice
he
tried
to
make
careless
has
he
asked
thorn
grace
hesitated
and
turned
her
head
as
she
felt
the
blood
creep
into
her
face
yes
you
see
there
is
nobody
else
i
not
sure
about
that
however
it
looks
as
if
thorn
had
not
sent
his
answer
yet
and
there
not
much
time
to
lose
you
expect
the
man
from
london
grace
said
they
did
and
studied
kit
while
he
pondered
his
preoccupied
look
indicated
that
he
was
working
out
some
plan
and
did
not
understand
how
bold
she
had
been
he
did
not
seem
at
all
surprised
that
she
had
come
to
him
she
had
broken
the
family
traditions
by
giving
him
her
confidence
but
she
felt
happier
i
like
to
see
gerald
he
said
it
important
and
i
be
at
ashness
at
four
if
he
will
not
come
you
must
let
me
know
i
send
him
if
i
can
said
grace
who
got
up
then
she
hesitated
and
looked
away
across
the
field
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
have
told
you
but
i
felt
i
must
and
i
glad
i
did
kit
smiled
and
after
walking
to
the
gate
with
her
went
on
with
his
mowing
her
story
left
out
much
he
wanted
to
know
but
he
thought
he
saw
where
it
led
and
would
get
the
rest
from
gerald
this
might
be
difficult
but
he
meant
to
insist
when
grace
reached
tarnside
she
met
gerald
on
the
lawn
and
took
him
to
the
bench
under
the
askew
wants
you
to
go
to
ashness
at
four
she
said
askew
wants
me
gerald
exclaimed
with
a
start
and
grace
thought
he
looked
afraid
why
i
do
know
he
said
it
was
important
gerald
looked
hard
at
her
well
i
suppose
it
is
important
but
how
does
he
know
about
the
thing
i
told
him
grace
answered
with
forced
quietness
you
told
him
gerald
gasped
and
then
laughed
harshly
i
knew
you
had
pluck
but
did
expect
this
you
do
seem
to
realize
what
an
extravagant
thing
you
done
i
do
it
does
matter
will
you
go
gerald
pondered
for
a
few
moments
and
then
looked
up
you
owe
me
nothing
grace
in
fact
you
and
mother
have
often
had
to
pay
for
my
folly
but
i
want
you
to
be
honest
now
i
imagine
you
understand
what
alan
expects
if
he
helps
me
out
yes
said
grace
in
a
strange
hard
voice
it
would
be
a
good
marriage
the
kind
of
marriage
you
ought
to
make
alan
rich
and
can
give
you
the
things
you
like
and
ought
to
have
but
with
all
that
i
imagine
you
sooner
let
it
go
i
hate
it
grace
said
quietly
i
do
like
alan
i
never
shall
like
him
he
has
some
drawbacks
gerald
remarked
and
was
silent
he
had
not
often
a
generous
impulse
but
he
was
moved
by
his
sister
distress
and
thought
he
saw
a
plan
the
plan
was
extravagant
and
risky
for
him
i
wonder
whether
you
sooner
marry
askew
he
resumed
grace
moved
abruptly
and
her
face
got
red
she
had
not
expected
the
question
and
was
highly
strung
gerald
saw
her
embarrassment
and
went
on
of
course
he
an
outsider
from
our
point
of
view
but
he
a
good
sort
in
fact
he
much
better
than
alan
besides
there
some
ground
for
believing
you
are
pretty
good
friends
stop
grace
exclaimed
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
unthinkable
that
you
should
meddle
gerald
smiled
i
not
going
to
give
askew
a
hint
if
that
is
what
you
mean
i
wanted
to
find
out
if
you
shrink
from
him
as
you
shrink
from
alan
and
i
think
i
know
you
do
know
grace
declared
and
then
stopped
and
blushed
as
she
met
his
steady
look
after
all
there
was
no
use
in
pretending
gerald
would
not
be
deceived
still
when
he
quietly
got
up
she
asked
with
alarm
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
going
to
ashness
gerald
replied
i
made
things
hard
for
you
and
mother
but
i
wo
bring
you
fresh
embarrassment
now
in
fact
i
think
you
can
trust
me
and
indeed
it
obvious
that
you
must
he
turned
and
looked
back
with
a
smile
if
askew
the
man
i
think
the
chief
will
shortly
get
a
jar
grace
wanted
to
call
him
back
but
somehow
could
not
and
sat
still
while
he
crossed
the
lawn
so
long
as
she
could
see
him
he
moved
carelessly
but
when
he
went
down
the
drive
behind
a
clipped
hedge
his
step
got
slow
and
his
face
was
hard
the
thing
he
meant
to
do
would
need
some
pluck
and
might
be
dangerous
if
he
had
not
judged
askew
right
in
the
meantime
kit
went
back
to
ashness
and
smoked
a
cigarette
while
he
pondered
what
grace
had
told
him
he
had
seen
that
she
did
not
altogether
know
her
brother
offense
but
since
money
was
needed
kit
could
guess
gerald
had
been
betting
or
speculating
and
had
used
money
that
was
not
his
undoubtedly
kit
did
not
think
he
had
robbed
his
employers
because
if
he
had
done
so
he
would
not
have
stayed
at
tarnside
he
had
however
robbed
somebody
and
as
kit
remembered
his
skill
with
the
pen
he
saw
a
light
gerald
had
used
somebody
else
name
on
the
back
of
a
bill
or
promissory
note
and
now
the
bill
must
be
met
presently
he
heard
steps
in
the
passage
and
looking
up
as
gerald
came
in
indicated
a
chair
gerald
sat
down
and
for
a
few
moments
kit
studied
him
quietly
it
was
obvious
that
he
felt
some
strain
but
his
look
was
resolute
and
kit
owned
that
he
had
more
pluck
than
he
had
thought
the
room
was
very
quiet
and
the
shadow
of
a
big
ash
tree
fell
across
the
open
window
the
musical
tinkle
of
a
binder
working
among
the
corn
came
faintly
down
the
dale
well
said
gerald
conscious
of
a
sense
of
relief
in
askew
presence
you
sent
for
me
i
did
your
sister
told
me
something
all
she
knew
perhaps
but
not
enough
anyhow
you
are
in
trouble
about
money
and
i
promised
to
help
for
my
sake
gerald
asked
kit
frowned
not
altogether
but
we
let
that
go
if
i
am
to
be
of
use
you
had
better
state
the
trouble
plainly
i
must
know
how
things
are
i
suppose
if
you
find
the
money
i
need
it
will
give
you
a
claim
on
us
gerald
remarked
meaningly
yes
said
kit
with
a
steady
look
but
that
wo
make
any
difference
i
do
mean
to
urge
my
claim
i
expect
this
clears
the
ground
it
does
it
some
relief
as
a
matter
of
fact
nobody
can
help
quite
as
much
as
you
ah
said
kit
i
think
i
see
you
used
name
what
was
the
sum
for
which
you
made
me
responsible
gerald
told
him
and
waited
anxiously
when
kit
knitted
his
brows
the
sum
was
not
so
large
as
the
latter
had
thought
and
osborn
inability
to
raise
it
indicated
that
he
was
seriously
embarrassed
i
understand
your
father
applied
to
thorn
said
kit
does
he
know
you
have
come
to
me
he
does
not
nobody
knows
but
grace
i
better
state
that
i
did
come
because
i
thought
you
take
a
generous
line
and
i
doubtful
about
thorn
kit
made
a
sign
of
understanding
thorn
has
arrived
yet
he
said
he
sent
a
note
he
come
across
but
when
i
left
he
had
arrived
my
notion
is
he
waiting
until
the
last
moment
with
the
object
of
making
us
realize
we
must
have
his
help
it
possible
said
kit
who
approved
gerald
handling
of
the
matter
the
lad
was
a
wastrel
but
he
had
run
some
risk
in
order
to
save
his
sister
from
being
forced
to
pay
for
his
fault
we
wo
bother
about
thorn
object
he
resumed
tell
me
about
your
difficulties
i
want
a
half
confidence
gerald
hesitated
and
then
began
his
tale
he
had
used
the
bank
money
to
speculate
with
and
had
lost
plunging
again
in
the
hope
of
getting
straight
he
had
got
alarmed
when
the
margin
shrank
and
had
gone
to
hallam
the
the
latter
had
insisted
on
a
guarantee
for
the
bill
and
gerald
had
used
kit
name
he
replaced
the
bank
money
and
had
hoped
the
shares
would
go
up
before
the
bill
fell
due
but
they
had
not
well
said
kit
quietly
i
expected
something
like
this
and
when
the
fellow
brings
the
bill
to
your
father
it
must
be
met
he
stopped
and
picking
up
a
newspaper
studied
the
steamship
advertisements
then
he
turned
to
gerald
there
another
thing
you
ca
get
a
post
in
england
and
for
your
mother
and
sister
sakes
had
better
leave
the
country
a
fast
new
york
boat
sails
from
liverpool
you
must
get
off
by
train
gerald
looked
at
him
with
surprise
but
i
not
going
to
new
york
no
money
and
do
know
what
to
do
when
i
get
there
i
fix
that
kit
said
dryly
you
are
going
anyhow
if
you
deliver
the
letter
i
give
you
to
some
people
in
mobile
they
find
you
a
job
the
rest
will
depend
upon
yourself
for
a
few
moments
gerald
hesitated
and
then
got
up
very
well
perhaps
it
the
best
chance
i
get
and
i
take
it
but
i
must
go
back
and
pack
i
think
not
said
kit
there
not
much
time
i
must
see
the
bank
manager
at
his
house
first
of
all
and
start
soon
you
come
with
me
to
the
town
sit
down
and
write
to
your
mother
i
see
she
gets
the
note
gerald
did
as
he
was
told
and
not
long
afterwards
kit
and
he
drove
out
of
the
ashness
lonning
and
took
the
road
to
the
town
chapter
ix
kit
goes
to
the
rescue
as
the
sun
got
lower
an
apathetic
gloom
began
to
replace
the
anxiety
that
had
kept
the
osborns
highly
strung
osborn
went
dejectedly
about
the
house
sometimes
moving
an
ornament
and
putting
away
a
book
for
her
brain
was
dull
and
she
felt
incapable
of
the
effort
to
rouse
herself
for
her
daughter
sake
thorn
had
not
arrived
and
if
he
did
not
come
soon
he
would
be
too
late
on
the
whole
this
was
some
relief
although
it
meant
that
there
was
no
escape
from
the
disaster
that
threatened
her
home
torn
by
conflicting
emotions
she
had
since
morning
struggled
against
the
binding
force
of
her
traditions
in
a
sense
it
was
grace
duty
to
save
the
family
honor
but
the
duty
would
cost
the
girl
too
much
yet
if
grace
failed
them
gerald
must
suffer
and
she
doubted
if
her
husband
could
bear
the
shame
that
must
fall
on
all
now
however
she
was
conscious
of
a
numbing
resignation
that
blunted
feeling
and
dulled
her
brain
in
the
meantime
grace
stood
at
the
lodge
gate
watching
the
road
to
ashness
while
the
shadows
crept
across
the
dale
gerald
had
not
come
back
and
she
had
not
told
her
mother
where
he
had
gone
the
delay
was
worrying
particularly
since
kit
had
sent
no
message
he
had
said
he
could
help
and
one
could
trust
him
but
he
did
not
come
and
the
confidence
she
had
felt
was
vanishing
if
it
was
not
well
placed
there
was
no
escape
for
her
and
she
shrank
with
horror
from
meeting
thorn
demand
the
shadows
got
longer
but
nothing
moved
on
the
road
that
ran
like
a
white
riband
across
the
fields
until
it
vanished
among
the
trees
at
ashness
presently
however
she
heard
the
throb
of
a
car
coming
up
the
valley
and
a
cloud
of
dust
rolled
up
behind
a
hedge
it
was
thorn
car
she
knew
its
hum
and
as
she
watched
the
dust
get
nearer
her
face
went
white
then
as
the
hum
became
loud
and
menacing
she
clenched
her
hand
and
ran
in
nervous
panic
up
the
drive
she
was
breathless
when
she
reached
the
house
but
pulled
herself
together
and
went
to
a
quiet
room
where
she
would
be
alone
osborn
sitting
in
the
library
heard
the
car
and
got
up
with
a
sense
of
relief
and
shrinking
he
had
been
afraid
that
thorn
would
fail
him
and
now
he
almost
wished
that
the
fellow
had
not
come
he
was
not
in
the
mood
to
be
logical
and
although
it
was
obvious
that
thorn
alone
could
save
him
from
disaster
knowing
what
grace
must
pay
hurt
him
more
than
he
had
thought
yet
she
must
pay
he
could
find
no
other
plan
now
he
was
acquiescent
but
not
resigned
and
his
hopelessness
gave
him
calm
thorn
face
was
hot
when
he
came
in
and
he
glanced
at
osborn
with
an
effort
for
carelessness
when
the
latter
indicated
a
chair
osborn
looked
old
and
broken
but
he
had
a
touch
of
dignity
that
was
new
i
sorry
if
i
late
thorn
remarked
i
had
to
go
to
swinset
and
had
trouble
with
the
car
osborn
wondered
dully
whether
this
was
the
real
ground
for
his
delay
but
he
said
oh
well
it
does
not
matter
now
you
have
arrived
i
gave
you
a
hint
about
my
object
in
sending
for
you
but
you
do
know
all
yet
i
imagine
i
know
enough
gerald
in
trouble
he
or
you
must
meet
the
bill
hallam
will
bring
you
see
the
fellow
belongs
to
my
club
and
i
had
a
talk
with
him
when
i
was
in
town
so
you
knew
what
threatened
us
osborn
remarked
rather
sharply
if
so
it
curious
you
waited
until
i
sent
for
you
thorn
hesitated
he
had
meant
to
be
tactful
but
it
looked
as
if
he
had
been
rash
osborn
suspicions
were
obviously
excited
the
matter
is
delicate
and
i
knew
you
would
send
for
me
if
you
thought
i
could
be
of
use
you
can
be
of
use
unless
i
take
up
the
fellow
bill
gerald
will
go
to
jail
thorn
made
a
sign
of
sympathy
he
was
surprised
by
osborn
bluntness
which
implied
that
the
latter
was
desperate
that
must
be
prevented
i
give
you
a
cheque
he
took
out
his
cheque
book
and
then
stopped
and
osborn
asked
is
this
a
free
loan
alan
i
mean
is
it
made
without
conditions
a
gift
if
you
like
anyhow
i
wo
bother
you
about
repayment
we
ca
talk
about
but
i
have
something
to
ask
grace
said
osborn
rather
hoarsely
yes
said
thorn
with
a
hint
of
embarrassment
i
want
grace
it
an
awkward
situation
i
do
want
to
urge
that
i
deserve
my
reward
but
i
waited
a
long
time
and
thought
you
approved
i
did
approve
i
hoped
she
marry
you
but
i
imagined
she
could
be
persuaded
and
would
do
so
willingly
however
it
looks
as
if
i
was
mistaken
thorn
leaned
forward
fixing
his
eyes
on
osborn
grace
is
young
and
perhaps
i
do
make
a
strong
appeal
to
her
romantic
feelings
but
i
belong
to
her
rank
and
her
views
and
tastes
are
mine
that
is
much
also
i
can
indulge
and
give
her
all
she
likes
the
refinements
and
comforts
to
which
she
is
in
a
sense
entitled
after
all
they
count
for
something
i
trying
to
be
practical
but
i
love
her
if
you
really
love
her
i
think
you
would
do
well
not
to
urge
her
just
now
osborn
remarked
quietly
ah
said
thorn
i
ca
wait
waiting
has
gained
me
nothing
and
there
is
a
risk
if
i
were
young
i
use
all
the
patience
i
could
control
but
i
getting
old
and
farther
away
from
grace
in
another
year
or
two
i
shall
be
bald
and
fat
perhaps
the
argument
humorous
but
it
has
a
cruel
force
for
me
there
are
other
girls
brought
up
as
we
have
brought
up
grace
they
might
be
flattered
thorn
spread
out
his
hands
you
do
understand
i
not
looking
for
a
wife
i
love
her
and
if
she
can
not
be
persuaded
will
never
marry
anybody
else
he
paused
and
resumed
with
some
emotion
i
know
the
shabbiness
of
using
this
opportunity
but
it
the
last
i
get
i
want
to
work
on
her
gratitude
but
i
see
no
other
plan
i
would
like
to
be
generous
but
i
ca
let
her
go
yet
you
seem
to
realize
that
she
does
not
like
you
she
will
get
over
that
her
likes
and
dislikes
have
yet
hardened
into
their
final
mold
she
impulsive
and
generous
i
can
win
her
by
patience
and
kindness
it
is
a
rash
experiment
if
you
are
disappointed
grace
would
have
to
pay
thorn
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
he
had
talked
with
sincere
passion
but
now
began
to
think
osborn
firmness
was
something
of
a
surprise
thorn
had
not
expected
he
would
weigh
his
daughter
feelings
against
the
danger
that
threatened
his
house
his
opposition
must
be
broken
down
i
had
hoped
for
your
consent
he
said
and
his
face
got
hard
to
some
extent
i
took
it
for
granted
osborn
head
sunk
forward
he
had
struggled
but
saw
that
he
was
beaten
to
beg
would
be
useless
and
he
could
not
fight
pulling
himself
together
with
an
effort
he
looked
up
you
mean
you
knew
i
could
not
refuse
yes
said
thorn
awkwardly
i
suppose
i
do
mean
something
like
that
osborn
gave
him
a
long
steady
look
thorn
face
was
set
and
his
mouth
was
firm
there
was
no
hint
of
yielding
and
osborn
got
up
very
well
i
must
tell
my
wife
he
rang
a
bell
and
a
minute
or
two
afterwards
osborn
came
in
she
sat
down
and
osborn
stood
opposite
alan
has
done
us
the
honor
of
asking
my
consent
to
his
marrying
grace
he
said
with
ironical
formality
if
we
approve
he
is
willing
to
help
gerald
he
turned
to
thorn
i
think
i
have
stated
your
terms
thorn
colored
as
he
saw
that
osborn
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
you
exaggerate
i
am
willing
to
do
you
a
service
that
nobody
else
can
render
and
think
i
justified
in
counting
on
your
gratitude
very
well
said
osborn
i
do
see
much
difference
except
that
you
want
to
save
our
pride
he
paused
and
looked
at
his
wife
you
know
grace
best
will
she
consent
something
in
his
manner
moved
osborn
it
was
long
since
he
had
asked
what
she
thought
and
she
felt
encouraged
besides
now
the
crisis
had
come
her
irresolution
had
vanished
she
had
thrown
off
her
reserve
and
meant
to
defend
her
daughter
no
she
said
with
a
determined
note
in
her
quiet
voice
even
if
she
were
willing
i
should
protest
the
fault
is
gerald
and
he
must
suffer
osborn
felt
some
surprise
but
his
humiliation
had
made
him
gentle
gerald
can
not
suffer
alone
his
disgrace
will
reflect
upon
us
all
and
if
he
has
a
son
it
will
follow
him
we
have
been
reckless
and
extravagant
but
we
have
kept
our
good
name
and
now
when
it
is
all
that
is
left
us
it
must
be
protected
that
was
gerald
duty
osborn
rejoined
and
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
to
some
extent
her
husband
point
of
view
was
hers
and
she
knew
his
finest
quality
was
his
exaggerated
family
pride
but
she
would
not
force
her
daughter
to
marry
thorn
i
will
not
consent
she
resumed
grace
has
long
suffered
for
her
brother
extravagance
but
she
shall
not
pay
for
his
folly
now
it
is
unjust
the
price
is
too
high
then
she
gave
thorn
an
appealing
glance
alan
can
you
not
be
generous
i
not
brave
enough
it
might
cost
me
too
much
thorn
answered
in
a
strained
voice
i
can
not
let
grace
go
she
would
be
happy
with
me
after
a
time
osborn
made
a
scornful
gesture
and
there
was
silence
osborn
moved
irresolutely
and
it
looked
as
if
he
were
hesitating
then
steps
echoed
along
the
landing
and
he
started
as
kit
came
in
thorn
face
got
very
dark
but
osborn
looked
up
with
a
strange
sense
of
relief
i
did
stop
to
ask
if
you
were
at
home
kit
remarked
as
you
know
time
is
getting
short
i
understand
a
man
from
london
will
bring
you
a
document
about
a
loan
that
is
so
said
osborn
hoarsely
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
the
document
take
it
up
kit
answered
with
a
look
of
surprise
my
name
on
the
back
he
paused
and
glanced
at
thorn
still
this
is
a
matter
sooner
talk
about
with
you
alone
thorn
got
up
making
an
effort
for
since
askew
has
arrived
i
need
stay
he
bowed
to
osborn
it
looks
as
if
i
had
not
understood
things
you
wo
need
my
help
he
went
out
with
a
curious
heavy
step
and
when
the
door
shut
osborn
sat
down
and
looked
at
kit
as
if
he
had
got
a
shock
then
you
have
come
to
humble
me
certainly
not
said
kit
i
should
have
come
before
but
had
to
find
my
bank
manager
who
had
left
his
office
where
is
gerald
what
have
you
done
with
him
osborn
asked
for
she
began
to
see
a
light
gerald
at
the
station
hotel
waiting
for
the
train
to
liverpool
he
sails
for
new
york
and
takes
a
letter
to
some
friends
of
mine
who
will
give
him
a
good
start
he
sent
a
note
osborn
read
the
note
and
her
eyes
shone
as
she
turned
them
on
kit
it
is
perhaps
the
best
plan
i
would
have
liked
to
see
him
but
i
thank
you
what
i
have
done
cost
me
nothing
and
i
imagine
gerald
will
have
as
good
as
chance
of
making
progress
as
he
had
at
the
bank
while
the
excitement
he
probably
get
will
suit
him
better
but
hallam
will
be
here
soon
if
the
train
is
punctual
and
before
he
comes
i
want
to
know
at
this
moment
they
heard
a
car
come
up
the
drive
a
servant
knocked
at
the
door
and
hallam
was
shown
in
he
sat
down
in
front
of
the
table
where
osborn
told
him
and
glanced
at
kit
this
is
askew
osborn
said
osborn
will
stay
she
knows
your
business
hallam
bowed
and
tried
not
to
look
surprised
very
well
i
have
brought
the
document
about
which
you
wrote
i
am
sorry
i
find
it
impossible
to
renew
the
loan
let
me
see
the
bill
said
kit
who
took
it
from
him
and
afterwards
nodded
yes
that
all
right
cancel
the
thing
and
i
give
you
a
cheque
you
admit
your
liability
then
hallam
asked
of
course
what
did
you
expect
my
name
here
it
not
my
habit
to
disown
my
debts
hallam
did
not
state
what
he
had
expected
he
was
tactful
and
was
satisfied
to
get
his
money
pulling
out
a
fountain
pen
he
cancelled
the
bill
and
put
kit
cheque
in
his
pocket
that
is
all
i
think
and
i
can
get
a
train
if
i
start
at
once
he
said
if
you
should
require
help
to
extend
your
farm
or
improve
your
stock
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
apply
to
me
i
afraid
your
interest
is
too
high
kit
rejoined
with
a
smile
and
hallam
bowed
to
the
others
and
went
out
when
he
had
gone
osborn
turned
to
kit
who
gave
osborn
the
cancelled
bill
i
do
understand
he
said
dully
why
have
you
come
to
my
rescue
to
some
extent
it
was
for
miss
osborn
sake
ah
said
osborn
i
suppose
you
have
a
demand
to
make
now
i
am
in
your
power
you
are
not
in
my
power
osborn
has
the
bill
and
if
you
can
not
repay
me
i
wo
urge
the
debt
but
there
is
so
to
speak
a
stipulation
you
must
use
no
pressure
to
persuade
miss
osborn
to
marry
mr
thorn
i
am
not
likely
to
do
so
osborn
remarked
dryly
he
paused
and
his
face
got
red
as
he
struggled
with
his
dislike
for
kit
you
have
taken
a
very
generous
line
askew
he
resumed
we
have
not
been
friends
but
i
must
confess
it
looks
as
if
i
had
been
unjust
kit
smiled
luck
made
us
antagonists
however
i
hope
the
antagonism
has
gone
for
good
because
after
all
i
have
something
to
ask
i
must
go
to
london
on
some
business
but
with
your
leave
i
will
again
call
in
a
week
you
will
find
us
at
home
when
you
do
come
osborn
answered
with
grave
politeness
and
when
kit
got
up
osborn
gave
him
her
hand
he
went
out
and
osborn
who
felt
limp
now
the
strain
had
slackened
leaned
back
heavily
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
his
wife
the
fellow
is
a
working
farmer
but
he
struck
just
the
right
note
well
he
has
beaten
me
and
it
easier
to
be
beaten
by
him
than
i
thought
but
he
states
he
coming
back
yes
said
osborn
i
think
he
means
to
ask
for
grace
osborn
knitted
his
brows
i
imagined
that
was
done
with
it
is
one
thing
to
take
his
help
and
another
to
give
him
grace
after
all
there
is
not
much
difference
between
his
plan
and
thorn
i
expect
you
will
find
the
difference
important
osborn
replied
with
a
smile
he
has
broken
down
your
unjustified
prejudice
and
if
he
is
the
man
i
think
he
will
leave
grace
free
to
refuse
if
she
likes
then
she
went
out
for
the
strain
had
been
hard
to
bear
and
osborn
sat
at
the
table
with
his
hand
tightly
closed
he
admitted
that
he
had
from
the
beginning
been
wrong
about
kit
but
his
prejudices
were
not
altogether
banished
yet
chapter
x
grace
choice
a
week
after
hallam
visit
kit
one
afternoon
started
for
tarnside
he
had
been
forced
to
go
to
london
about
some
american
business
but
this
was
a
relief
since
it
gave
him
an
excuse
for
delay
at
his
interview
with
osborn
he
had
left
the
most
important
thing
unsaid
because
it
might
have
jarred
osborn
whom
he
thought
his
friend
had
he
asked
for
grace
at
the
moment
he
had
put
her
father
in
his
debt
in
fact
he
saw
it
would
be
tactful
if
he
waited
for
some
time
but
he
did
not
mean
to
do
so
to
some
extent
he
distrusted
osborn
and
resolved
to
make
his
request
before
the
latter
gratitude
began
to
cool
grace
must
have
full
liberty
to
refuse
but
he
did
not
owe
her
father
much
he
wondered
how
she
would
choose
and
his
step
got
slower
until
he
stopped
and
sitting
on
a
broken
wall
looked
up
the
valley
the
day
was
calm
and
the
sun
shone
on
smooth
pasture
and
yellow
corn
the
becks
had
shrunk
in
the
shady
ghylls
and
a
thin
white
line
was
all
that
marked
the
fall
where
the
main
stream
leaped
down
the
force
crag
on
the
steep
slopes
the
heather
made
purple
patches
among
the
and
malton
moor
shone
red
kit
loved
the
quiet
hills
he
had
known
intrigue
and
adventure
and
now
saw
his
work
waiting
in
his
native
dale
the
soil
called
him
his
job
was
to
extend
the
and
improve
his
flocks
this
was
important
because
he
could
not
tell
how
far
grace
would
sympathize
her
father
liked
the
leading
place
an
effort
for
display
and
such
luxury
as
could
be
cheaply
got
were
the
rule
at
tarnside
it
was
possible
that
grace
had
unconsciously
accepted
a
false
standard
of
values
kit
might
for
her
sake
have
changed
his
mode
of
life
had
he
thought
it
good
for
her
but
he
did
not
she
must
have
inherited
something
of
osborn
tastes
and
to
copy
the
tarnside
customs
might
encourage
their
development
it
was
better
to
remove
her
from
insidious
influences
to
fresh
surroundings
where
she
would
so
to
speak
breath
a
bracing
air
but
this
could
not
be
done
unless
she
were
willing
to
go
kit
knitted
his
brows
as
he
mused
because
there
was
not
much
to
indicate
whether
he
would
find
grace
willing
or
not
she
liked
him
well
enough
but
he
had
not
ventured
to
pose
as
her
lover
he
was
too
proud
and
jealous
for
her
knowing
what
osborn
thought
he
would
not
involve
her
in
a
secret
intrigue
yet
she
had
been
kind
and
he
had
now
and
then
got
a
hint
of
an
elusive
tenderness
moreover
in
her
distress
she
had
come
to
him
she
was
proud
and
he
thought
would
not
have
asked
his
help
unless
she
was
willing
to
give
something
in
return
after
a
time
he
got
up
with
a
quick
resolute
movement
he
would
soon
know
if
he
had
set
his
hopes
too
high
and
would
gain
nothing
by
indulging
his
doubts
crossing
a
field
where
the
binders
were
at
work
he
went
up
the
tarnside
drive
with
a
firm
step
and
saw
osborn
and
osborn
sitting
under
the
it
looked
as
if
they
were
waiting
for
him
and
he
braced
himself
as
he
advanced
osborn
smiled
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
osborn
indicated
a
box
of
cigarettes
sit
down
osborn
will
give
you
some
tea
presently
he
said
with
an
effort
for
hospitable
politeness
because
he
could
not
yet
resign
himself
to
the
demand
his
wife
expected
kit
would
make
you
have
been
to
town
on
business
he
resumed
feeling
that
silence
would
be
awkward
i
hope
you
found
things
satisfactory
i
did
said
kit
who
was
glad
that
osborn
had
no
doubt
unconsciously
given
him
a
lead
he
had
gone
to
visit
the
agents
of
his
american
bankers
and
had
learned
that
adam
estate
had
turned
out
to
be
worth
more
than
he
had
thought
it
was
a
relief
because
it
helps
me
to
get
over
some
of
the
hesitation
i
felt
he
resumed
i
want
your
permission
to
ask
miss
osborn
if
she
will
marry
me
osborn
tried
to
hide
his
disturbed
feelings
and
answered
with
forced
quietness
my
wife
warned
me
that
i
might
expect
something
like
this
but
i
must
own
that
i
find
agreement
hard
however
after
the
help
you
have
given
us
it
is
plain
that
i
must
try
to
overcome
my
reluctance
that
is
all
i
ask
in
the
meantime
said
kit
i
do
expect
you
to
influence
miss
osborn
in
fact
she
must
understand
that
i
have
no
claim
and
feel
herself
free
to
refuse
you
are
generous
osborn
remarked
of
course
it
is
obvious
that
her
gratitude
must
count
for
much
i
do
want
her
gratitude
to
count
kit
declared
and
osborn
gave
him
a
puzzled
glance
there
is
something
else
that
must
be
said
grace
has
been
indulged
and
knows
nothing
of
frugality
that
you
think
proper
and
usual
would
be
hardship
to
her
can
you
give
your
wife
the
comforts
and
refinements
she
has
had
at
home
kit
noted
osborn
faint
smile
and
wondered
whether
it
hinted
at
ironical
amusement
but
he
put
a
document
on
the
table
you
are
entitled
to
ask
and
i
have
brought
a
short
draught
of
the
arrangements
i
am
ready
to
make
if
i
am
fortunate
enough
to
win
your
daughter
osborn
picked
up
the
paper
and
gave
it
to
his
wife
then
he
looked
at
kit
with
surprise
this
alters
things
you
are
almost
a
rich
man
if
you
wanted
you
could
buy
a
house
like
tarnside
no
said
kit
firmly
it
alters
nothing
and
leaves
me
where
i
was
satisfied
with
ashness
ah
said
osborn
you
mean
you
would
sooner
be
a
working
farmer
than
a
country
gentleman
the
preference
is
somewhat
remarkable
i
know
where
i
belong
the
important
thing
is
that
if
miss
osborn
marries
me
she
will
be
a
farmer
wife
exactly
said
osborn
from
my
point
of
view
it
an
awkward
drawback
i
doubt
if
my
daughter
is
suited
for
the
part
he
looked
at
osborn
and
resumed
but
this
is
a
matter
grace
must
decide
about
and
you
insisted
that
no
pressure
should
be
used
i
imagine
you
were
afraid
of
my
influence
and
do
not
know
if
i
am
afraid
of
yours
or
not
if
you
agree
i
will
send
for
her
kit
said
he
was
willing
and
was
silent
when
osborn
went
away
although
he
imagined
osborn
was
sympathetic
he
could
not
force
himself
to
talk
since
he
had
insisted
that
persuasion
must
not
be
used
he
could
not
demand
to
meet
grace
alone
and
she
might
find
it
hard
to
accept
his
plans
without
some
explanation
which
would
be
awkward
to
give
when
her
parents
were
there
he
could
if
he
wanted
change
his
mode
of
life
but
if
they
were
to
be
happy
she
must
be
removed
from
influences
he
thought
dangerous
and
he
must
use
his
energy
in
useful
work
he
saw
this
very
clearly
but
whether
grace
would
see
it
was
another
thing
he
felt
some
strain
while
he
waited
and
watched
the
trembling
shadows
move
upon
the
grass
the
rays
of
light
that
pierced
the
dark
foliage
flickered
about
osborn
dress
and
when
he
glanced
at
her
he
thought
her
look
encouraging
but
she
did
not
speak
by
and
by
osborn
returned
and
said
grace
was
coming
and
kit
found
the
suspense
hard
to
bear
at
length
she
came
and
his
heart
beat
as
he
watched
her
cross
the
lawn
she
wore
a
plain
white
dress
and
when
she
stopped
in
front
of
the
others
her
face
was
pale
but
calm
askew
has
asked
my
permission
to
marry
you
and
i
can
not
refuse
if
you
agree
osborn
said
in
a
formal
tone
he
stipulates
that
i
must
not
persuade
you
one
way
or
the
other
and
declares
that
he
does
not
want
to
work
upon
your
gratitude
some
color
came
into
grace
face
as
she
looked
at
kit
then
you
value
my
gratitude
i
value
it
very
much
kit
replied
with
forced
quietness
but
i
feel
it
ought
not
to
count
he
stopped
awkwardly
for
he
noted
a
sparkle
in
grace
eyes
and
felt
that
he
was
badly
handicapped
she
was
proud
and
probably
did
not
understand
his
disinterested
attitude
it
was
a
relief
when
osborn
interposed
askew
is
trying
to
be
just
we
have
agreed
that
you
are
not
to
be
influenced
ah
said
grace
i
think
i
see
she
waited
and
osborn
went
on
since
you
are
to
make
a
free
choice
i
must
state
things
as
plainly
as
i
can
askew
is
not
poor
he
is
able
to
give
you
all
we
think
you
ought
to
have
in
fact
there
is
no
very
obvious
reason
he
should
not
leave
ashness
but
he
does
not
mean
to
do
so
and
although
i
can
not
follow
his
argument
imagines
that
it
would
be
better
for
you
both
if
he
carries
on
his
farming
it
looks
as
if
he
did
not
approve
our
rule
kit
frowned
and
colored
when
grace
turned
to
him
on
the
whole
osborn
had
not
stated
things
incorrectly
but
the
situation
was
embarrassing
grace
would
no
doubt
resent
the
stipulation
he
felt
forced
to
make
and
expect
a
more
attitude
from
the
man
who
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
grace
he
said
appealingly
i
afraid
you
do
understand
but
when
you
must
give
up
so
much
i
durst
not
hide
the
drawbacks
besides
agreed
that
i
must
not
urge
you
she
studied
him
for
a
moment
i
do
understand
she
said
and
then
turned
to
osborn
i
suppose
you
are
trying
to
guard
me
but
i
am
not
afraid
one
gets
tired
of
pretense
and
secret
economy
and
forced
idleness
has
not
much
charm
well
if
askew
knowing
what
he
knows
about
us
is
willing
to
run
the
risk
grace
said
kit
moving
forward
but
she
stopped
him
with
a
proud
gesture
there
is
a
risk
i
think
we
shall
both
need
courage
but
if
you
are
willing
i
need
not
hesitate
i
will
try
to
make
a
good
farmer
wife
she
turned
and
went
away
and
the
blood
came
into
kit
face
as
he
looked
at
osborn
i
have
played
fair
but
it
was
hard
now
you
have
heard
her
answer
at
liberty
to
plead
my
cause
osborn
said
nothing
but
his
wife
gave
kit
a
friendly
smile
and
he
went
off
with
a
resolute
step
in
pursuit
of
grace
he
came
up
with
her
in
a
shrubbery
but
it
looked
as
if
she
did
not
hear
him
for
her
head
was
bent
grace
he
said
putting
his
hand
on
her
arm
i
embarrassed
and
in
a
way
ashamed
she
turned
and
confronted
him
with
her
wonted
calm
i
do
see
why
you
are
ashamed
you
were
just
i
think
i
mean
quite
impartial
you
wanted
me
to
weigh
things
and
would
have
been
resigned
if
i
had
found
the
drawbacks
too
much
it
was
as
easy
as
you
think
said
kit
grimly
in
fact
i
was
burning
with
anger
and
suspense
but
you
see
i
had
promised
your
father
yes
said
grace
that
was
plain
you
were
firm
when
you
thought
i
might
be
forced
to
marry
thorn
and
when
father
agreed
not
to
use
his
influence
i
suppose
you
could
not
use
yours
well
i
glad
you
were
angry
it
was
human
and
your
scrupulous
fairness
was
not
flattering
she
paused
and
to
kit
relief
gave
him
a
smile
after
all
it
would
not
have
hurt
to
be
urged
to
marry
the
man
i
did
like
you
mean
me
said
kit
and
boldly
took
her
in
his
arms
she
drew
back
from
him
blushing
after
a
few
moments
but
kit
was
content
there
was
something
fascinatingly
elusive
about
grace
and
he
could
wait
they
went
on
quietly
down
the
path
until
they
came
to
a
bench
in
a
shady
nook
kit
leaned
against
a
tree
and
grace
sat
down
kit
she
said
i
did
know
you
were
rich
it
really
does
matter
but
i
glad
i
fell
in
love
with
you
when
i
did
know
then
you
were
in
love
with
me
she
smiled
of
course
i
must
have
been
when
i
came
to
you
because
i
was
afraid
of
thorn
love
gave
me
confidence
i
knew
you
would
help
in
a
way
i
did
an
extravagant
thing
because
you
were
not
really
like
a
lover
at
all
the
control
i
used
often
hurt
said
kit
i
was
afraid
i
might
alarm
and
lose
you
it
was
much
to
see
you
now
and
then
he
paused
feeling
there
was
something
to
be
said
that
must
be
said
now
however
about
ashness
oh
said
grace
i
suppose
it
cost
you
an
effort
to
be
firm
and
i
hope
it
did
you
need
be
afraid
though
when
my
father
told
me
i
understood
and
it
wo
hurt
to
leave
tarnside
i
anxious
to
get
away
my
dear
said
kit
ashness
has
some
charm
and
we
will
try
to
make
it
a
proper
home
for
you
it
is
a
home
i
sometimes
went
to
see
your
father
i
liked
him
so
much
kit
one
feels
the
old
house
has
sheltered
sincere
men
and
women
who
loved
each
other
and
something
they
left
haunts
the
quiet
spot
i
want
you
to
alter
it
much
you
shall
alter
it
as
you
like
the
only
rule
at
ashness
will
be
what
pleases
you
now
you
very
nice
i
going
to
be
happy
because
i
can
be
myself
so
far
i
been
forced
to
be
reserved
you
do
really
know
me
kit
perhaps
that
true
kit
remarked
you
wonderful
because
always
some
fresh
charm
to
learn
i
thought
i
knew
you
before
i
went
away
but
when
i
came
back
i
saw
how
foolish
i
was
i
wonder
whether
you
knew
i
loved
you
then
grace
blushed
i
think
i
knew
and
felt
cheated
why
did
you
feel
cheated
oh
said
grace
i
liked
you
i
was
young
and
felt
i
was
entitled
to
love
a
man
who
loved
me
if
i
wanted
but
could
use
my
right
then
not
long
since
when
you
were
so
grave
and
just
i
felt
i
had
been
cheated
worse
i
see
said
kit
and
came
nearer
the
bench
i
was
cheated
too
but
look
at
me
dear
and
i
try
to
tell
you
all
i
think
he
told
her
with
fire
and
passion
and
when
he
stopped
bending
down
to
her
she
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
now
you
ridiculously
romantic
but
you
very
charming
kit
she
said
chapter
xi
osborn
surrender
by
degrees
osborn
accepted
his
daughter
choice
philosophically
kit
was
not
the
he
had
wanted
but
he
was
forced
to
admit
that
the
fellow
jarred
less
than
he
had
thought
for
one
thing
he
never
reminded
osborn
of
the
benefit
he
had
conferred
and
the
latter
noted
that
his
neighbors
opened
their
doors
to
him
they
could
not
of
course
altogether
ignore
the
man
grace
had
promised
to
marry
but
osborn
soon
had
grounds
for
imagining
that
they
liked
kit
for
himself
the
wedding
had
been
fixed
and
osborn
although
not
satisfied
was
resigned
in
the
meantime
it
began
to
look
as
if
the
gloom
that
had
long
ruled
at
tarnside
was
banished
osborn
reserve
was
less
marked
she
smiled
and
her
step
was
lighter
grace
too
had
changed
and
developed
she
had
often
been
impatient
but
now
was
marked
by
a
happy
calm
osborn
found
her
gentler
and
sometimes
strangely
compliant
although
he
felt
he
must
make
no
rash
demands
the
girl
indulged
him
but
she
could
be
firm
her
new
serenity
had
a
charm
moreover
gerald
wrote
cheerful
letters
and
declared
that
he
was
making
better
progress
than
would
have
been
possible
for
him
at
home
osborn
had
seldom
thought
much
about
the
happiness
of
his
family
but
he
felt
a
dull
satisfaction
because
things
were
going
well
with
the
others
it
was
a
against
his
troubles
which
were
getting
worse
the
improvements
his
tenants
and
hayes
had
forced
him
to
make
cost
more
than
he
calculated
and
he
met
stubborn
resistance
when
he
talked
about
putting
up
the
rents
the
money
he
had
got
by
the
last
mortgage
had
gone
he
could
not
borrow
more
and
his
creditors
demanded
payment
of
his
debts
he
put
off
the
reckoning
however
until
one
day
when
he
drove
to
the
market
town
to
consult
his
agent
he
got
a
rude
jar
in
the
first
place
hayes
kept
him
waiting
in
a
cold
room
and
he
stood
for
a
time
by
the
window
looking
out
drearily
at
the
square
the
day
was
bleak
and
wet
and
the
high
moors
that
shut
in
the
little
town
loomed
blurred
and
forbidding
through
drifting
mist
the
square
was
empty
the
fronts
of
the
tall
old
houses
were
dark
with
rain
and
the
drops
from
a
clump
of
bare
trees
fell
in
a
steady
shower
on
the
grass
behind
the
iron
rails
the
gloom
reacted
upon
osborn
disturbed
mood
and
he
frowned
when
hayes
came
in
i
sent
you
word
that
i
would
call
he
said
you
did
hayes
agreed
i
was
occupied
when
my
clerk
told
me
you
were
here
osborn
looked
at
him
with
some
surprise
hayes
was
very
cool
and
not
apologetic
well
he
said
you
know
what
i
want
to
talk
about
i
suppose
you
have
seen
forsyth
and
langdon
about
the
renewal
of
their
leases
yes
both
state
they
go
sooner
than
pay
you
extra
rent
then
they
must
go
osborn
rejoined
trying
to
hide
his
disappointment
since
he
had
spent
some
money
on
the
steadings
in
the
hope
of
raising
the
rent
now
he
came
to
think
of
it
hayes
had
held
this
out
as
an
inducement
when
he
urged
the
expenditure
it
looks
as
if
your
judgment
was
very
good
but
by
comparison
with
other
things
the
matter
not
important
he
resumed
you
know
the
sum
i
need
between
now
and
the
end
of
the
term
i
do
know
in
fact
i
imagine
you
will
need
more
than
you
suspect
hayes
rejoined
you
find
it
impossible
to
borrow
the
money
on
satisfactory
terms
osborn
looked
hard
at
him
the
fellow
manner
was
rather
abrupt
than
sympathetic
but
hayes
went
on
before
we
advertise
for
new
tenants
there
is
something
i
want
to
suggest
although
the
farms
are
mortgaged
i
might
be
able
to
find
a
buyer
at
a
price
no
said
osborn
firmly
the
buyer
would
have
to
undertake
the
debt
and
the
sum
he
would
be
willing
to
pay
would
not
last
me
long
when
it
was
spent
i
have
practically
nothing
left
the
situation
awkward
but
there
it
is
of
course
if
you
were
able
to
carry
on
until
your
rents
come
in
you
know
i
ca
carry
on
i
came
to
you
hoping
you
might
suggest
a
workable
plan
who
is
the
buyer
i
am
said
hayes
osborn
face
got
red
and
he
struggled
for
the
fellow
was
his
servant
but
it
looked
as
if
he
had
cunningly
involved
him
in
entanglements
an
honest
agent
would
have
avoided
osborn
remembered
that
he
had
sometimes
vaguely
suspected
hayes
now
he
knew
him
it
was
too
late
i
may
be
forced
to
sell
but
not
to
you
he
said
haughtily
hayes
shrugged
that
must
be
as
you
like
but
i
able
to
give
you
a
better
price
than
anybody
else
i
have
an
object
for
buying
the
farms
and
if
necessary
would
pay
something
near
their
proper
value
without
taking
off
much
for
the
debt
anyhow
you
had
better
look
at
this
statement
of
your
liabilities
osborn
studied
the
document
with
a
hopeless
feeling
things
were
worse
than
he
had
feared
and
it
cost
him
an
effort
to
pull
himself
together
when
he
looked
up
why
do
you
want
to
buy
he
asked
well
you
see
the
land
between
forsyth
and
the
is
heavily
mortgaged
and
taking
the
two
farms
with
the
others
would
make
a
compact
block
that
could
be
economically
worked
the
new
estate
would
run
down
to
tarnside
and
since
you
may
find
it
needful
to
sell
the
house
i
might
make
you
an
offer
but
the
consolidation
would
help
osborn
remarked
with
a
puzzled
look
it
would
perhaps
be
an
advantage
for
the
mortgage
holders
i
hold
the
mortgages
hayes
said
quietly
osborn
started
but
he
stammered
i
got
the
money
from
somebody
else
that
is
so
i
bought
the
other
debts
and
supplied
the
funds
when
you
raised
new
loans
you
bought
the
debts
with
my
money
osborn
exclaimed
you
used
your
post
to
rob
me
of
my
estate
i
suppose
one
must
make
allowances
but
you
are
unjust
you
got
the
proper
value
for
the
land
you
pawned
and
squandered
the
money
the
consequence
was
inevitable
and
it
futile
to
complain
for
that
matter
it
is
not
altogether
unusual
for
a
landlord
and
his
steward
to
change
places
i
trusted
you
and
you
cheated
me
osborn
resumed
with
poignant
bitterness
you
lived
in
false
security
and
refused
to
think
you
knew
the
reckoning
must
come
but
were
satisfied
if
you
could
put
it
off
now
you
must
bear
the
consequences
it
is
not
my
fault
however
this
is
not
important
will
you
sell
no
said
osborn
hoarsely
i
will
not
sell
to
hayes
smiled
you
must
sell
to
somebody
and
will
not
get
as
good
a
price
osborn
got
up
and
went
out
with
a
dragging
step
the
blow
had
left
him
numb
but
as
he
drove
home
in
the
rain
he
had
a
hazy
notion
that
statements
were
to
some
extent
justified
he
had
lived
in
false
security
seeing
how
things
were
going
and
yet
refusing
to
believe
somehow
it
had
looked
impossible
for
him
to
lose
tarnside
the
estate
was
his
by
the
sacred
right
of
inheritance
for
a
hundred
years
there
had
been
an
osborn
at
the
hall
yet
the
estate
had
gone
and
he
was
to
blame
it
had
so
to
speak
melted
in
his
careless
hands
he
felt
old
and
broken
when
he
told
his
wife
and
daughter
about
the
interview
osborn
did
not
look
as
much
surprised
as
he
had
thought
and
grace
although
sympathetic
was
calm
they
had
known
the
blow
was
coming
and
were
ready
for
the
shock
after
a
time
osborn
left
them
and
grace
looked
at
her
mother
i
must
tell
kit
yes
said
osborn
i
think
he
ought
to
know
though
this
is
not
a
matter
in
which
he
can
help
it
looks
like
that
grace
agreed
and
then
paused
with
a
confident
smile
but
kit
rather
wonderful
you
do
really
know
him
yet
he
always
finds
a
way
when
there
is
something
hard
to
be
done
ah
said
osborn
there
is
comfort
in
our
troubles
since
they
have
given
you
a
man
you
can
trust
grace
went
to
ashness
and
found
kit
studying
some
accounts
in
the
room
she
called
his
museum
put
the
books
away
come
to
the
fire
and
talk
to
me
said
grace
and
stopped
him
when
he
moved
a
chair
i
think
i
take
the
low
stool
wretchedly
cold
and
i
really
came
to
be
comforted
she
sat
down
leaning
against
his
chair
with
her
head
turned
so
that
she
could
look
up
and
held
her
hands
to
the
fire
kit
heart
beat
for
grace
had
developed
recently
her
reserve
had
gone
and
a
curious
frank
tenderness
had
come
instead
this
is
very
nice
she
resumed
there
something
very
homelike
about
ashness
perhaps
i
romantic
but
i
sometimes
feel
as
if
your
father
was
still
at
the
old
house
it
kind
and
quiet
like
him
do
you
think
people
can
leave
an
influence
kit
yours
will
last
so
far
i
have
had
much
quietness
i
afraid
i
come
to
bother
you
again
i
hate
to
bother
you
but
somehow
trouble
seems
to
follow
me
your
troubles
are
mine
kit
said
and
stroked
her
head
tell
me
about
it
grace
told
him
and
although
he
said
nothing
waited
calmly
his
face
was
thoughtful
but
the
silence
was
not
awkward
she
felt
that
it
was
marked
by
an
intimate
confidence
kit
she
resumed
at
length
i
do
know
if
you
can
help
or
if
you
ought
you
must
decide
dear
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
and
comforted
i
can
help
kit
answered
quietly
people
abroad
have
paid
some
debts
i
did
expect
to
get
and
i
richer
than
i
thought
he
paused
and
mused
for
a
moment
or
two
it
strange
the
thing
should
happen
now
when
i
came
home
i
imagined
ashness
would
occupy
all
my
time
but
i
soon
began
to
feel
i
had
scope
enough
you
see
i
been
with
adam
and
he
was
a
hustler
well
it
looks
as
if
i
had
found
a
new
field
you
mean
you
might
buy
tarnside
yes
i
think
the
estate
might
be
made
to
pay
high
farming
a
risky
business
in
our
climate
and
we
have
been
satisfied
to
spend
little
and
get
a
small
return
i
think
there
a
better
plan
than
that
if
one
uses
modern
methods
and
can
invest
the
capital
however
i
see
an
obstacle
to
my
buying
tarnside
father
grace
suggested
well
i
afraid
he
would
never
be
economical
and
he
likes
to
rule
but
i
did
mean
kit
that
you
should
give
him
money
to
squander
i
know
said
kit
gently
although
his
face
was
rather
stern
legacy
must
not
be
wasted
in
extravagance
then
you
see
tarnside
ought
to
have
been
gerald
but
he
ruled
out
grace
looked
up
yes
kit
now
you
have
given
him
a
fresh
start
he
may
make
a
useful
man
but
tarnside
is
not
for
him
she
paused
and
blushed
but
her
glance
was
steady
as
she
went
on
it
must
be
ours
if
you
buy
it
for
us
to
hold
in
trust
she
turned
her
head
and
kit
quietly
touched
her
hair
they
were
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
then
he
said
if
the
estate
is
to
be
properly
managed
my
part
will
need
much
tact
and
i
impatient
now
and
then
but
we
would
live
at
ashness
and
your
mother
would
understand
my
difficulties
she
would
help
father
old
kit
and
might
be
indulged
you
would
try
not
to
hurt
him
and
could
consult
him
about
things
that
did
matter
i
think
he
be
satisfied
if
you
let
him
imagine
he
had
some
control
kit
smiled
very
well
we
will
make
the
plunge
tell
your
father
to
do
nothing
until
hayes
moves
the
fellow
cunning
and
it
might
be
better
if
he
did
know
what
we
mean
to
do
he
bent
down
and
kissed
her
and
she
pressed
her
face
against
his
hand
kit
you
wonderful
things
get
done
when
you
come
on
the
scene
but
perhaps
you
nicest
when
they
done
for
me
after
all
i
am
an
osborn
and
would
have
hated
to
let
tarnside
go
let
plan
what
we
can
do
when
it
belongs
to
us
for
a
time
they
engaged
in
happy
talk
but
kit
reopened
his
account
books
when
grace
went
home
it
looked
as
if
he
were
about
to
make
a
rash
plunge
because
he
would
not
have
much
money
left
when
he
had
carried
out
his
plans
however
he
could
guard
against
the
worst
risks
and
on
the
whole
imagined
the
venture
ought
to
pay
some
weeks
later
osborn
sent
for
him
and
on
reaching
tarnside
he
was
shown
into
the
library
osborn
was
with
her
husband
and
there
was
a
bundle
of
papers
on
the
big
table
i
have
got
the
particulars
you
wanted
osborn
said
hayes
will
arrive
in
half
an
hour
but
that
should
give
us
time
enough
kit
nodded
yes
i
want
a
few
minutes
when
he
had
studied
the
documents
he
looked
up
tarnside
would
soon
be
his
and
he
glanced
about
the
library
with
a
new
curiosity
although
the
day
was
dark
and
rain
beat
upon
the
high
windows
the
light
was
strong
enough
to
show
the
fine
modeling
of
the
old
and
shabby
furniture
it
was
a
noble
room
and
with
well
used
money
could
be
given
a
touch
of
stateliness
but
there
was
something
cold
and
austere
about
tarnside
while
ashness
was
homelike
and
warm
his
short
survey
strengthened
feeling
that
he
belonged
to
the
farm
and
not
the
hall
two
things
are
obvious
he
remarked
the
mortgages
must
be
wiped
off
and
when
other
debts
have
been
paid
the
rents
of
the
land
i
willing
to
redeem
ought
to
keep
you
going
if
they
economically
used
i
doubt
it
osborn
rejoined
so
far
the
rent
of
the
whole
estate
have
failed
to
do
so
they
will
do
so
now
kit
said
rather
dryly
that
is
if
i
to
free
the
land
but
you
must
decide
if
you
will
help
or
not
he
looked
at
osborn
who
made
a
sign
of
agreement
there
will
be
enough
kit
indeed
in
some
ways
we
shall
be
better
off
than
we
were
you
have
pluck
said
kit
and
turned
to
osborn
knowing
he
must
be
firm
the
house
and
grounds
will
be
yours
to
use
as
you
like
and
the
farmers
will
bring
their
complaints
and
requests
first
to
you
you
will
be
the
acknowledged
landlord
and
i
shall
be
glad
of
your
advice
but
the
expenditure
will
be
controlled
by
me
osborn
did
not
reply
but
osborn
said
it
is
a
generous
offer
kit
waited
conscious
of
some
suspense
for
he
doubted
if
osborn
pride
was
quite
humbled
yet
he
did
not
want
to
humble
him
but
for
the
sake
of
grace
and
her
mother
did
not
mean
to
let
him
wreck
his
plans
after
a
few
moments
osborn
looked
up
it
is
a
hard
choice
but
you
have
taken
the
proper
line
and
resigned
he
said
after
all
i
have
had
my
day
and
although
luck
has
been
against
me
can
not
claim
that
i
have
used
it
well
besides
i
not
robbing
gerald
by
agreeing
to
your
plan
gerald
robbed
himself
and
me
he
paused
and
went
on
with
some
emotion
very
well
i
ready
to
abdicate
and
thank
you
for
trying
to
save
my
feelings
by
giving
me
nominal
control
there
was
nothing
more
of
much
importance
to
be
said
and
with
the
object
of
banishing
the
strain
kit
began
to
talk
about
improving
some
of
the
farms
osborn
did
not
help
him
much
but
he
kept
it
up
until
hayes
arrived
the
latter
seemed
surprised
to
see
kit
and
hesitated
when
osborn
indicated
a
chair
osborn
will
stay
and
i
brought
askew
to
meet
you
as
you
like
said
hayes
who
looked
annoyed
but
sat
down
and
took
out
some
documents
you
have
had
formal
notice
that
repayment
of
these
loans
is
due
and
it
would
be
an
advantage
to
make
arrangements
for
taking
up
the
other
mortgages
that
will
soon
run
out
some
time
since
i
made
you
an
offer
that
you
refused
that
is
so
osborn
agreed
your
offer
is
still
unacceptable
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
must
advertise
the
mortgaged
farms
for
public
sale
and
when
arrears
of
interest
various
charges
and
smaller
loans
are
deducted
there
will
probably
be
nothing
left
the
rest
is
not
my
business
but
i
have
managed
the
estate
and
do
not
see
how
you
can
carry
on
it
is
not
your
business
and
askew
has
a
plan
hayes
smiled
as
he
turned
to
kit
you
may
perhaps
resent
my
advice
but
i
think
it
sound
you
would
be
rash
to
meddle
a
small
sum
would
be
swallowed
up
and
make
no
difference
you
would
be
poorer
and
osborn
would
not
gain
that
obvious
if
the
sum
were
small
kit
agreed
but
how
much
do
you
expect
to
get
if
you
sell
the
farms
he
nodded
when
hayes
told
him
a
fair
estimate
i
think
we
can
take
it
as
the
proper
price
you
mean
to
buy
the
farms
in
but
i
want
them
too
and
if
you
force
a
sale
i
bid
higher
can
you
bid
against
me
hayes
asked
with
something
of
a
sneer
i
answer
that
afterwards
in
the
meantime
let
me
state
that
i
want
the
other
farms
when
the
mortgages
run
out
you
can
fight
me
if
you
like
but
i
do
think
it
will
pay
you
and
if
we
run
prices
up
osborn
will
gain
very
well
here
my
offer
to
buy
up
all
his
debts
he
gave
a
document
to
hayes
who
studied
it
with
surprise
i
presume
you
serious
the
latter
said
with
an
effort
you
are
rasher
than
i
thought
if
you
can
make
this
offer
good
i
can
certainly
make
it
good
you
had
better
apply
to
the
bank
manager
if
you
have
doubts
for
a
few
moments
hayes
studied
kit
who
looked
quietly
resolute
then
he
said
you
are
determined
to
oppose
me
if
i
do
consent
yes
said
kit
i
mean
to
buy
all
the
land
osborn
has
pawned
if
you
want
it
you
have
to
pay
the
price
i
fix
since
it
must
be
a
public
sale
do
you
think
it
would
be
prudent
to
accept
my
offer
hayes
clenched
his
fist
but
with
an
effort
preserved
his
i
am
forced
to
agree
very
well
take
the
documents
to
my
lawyers
and
as
soon
as
they
are
satisfied
i
give
you
a
check
hayes
nodded
silently
and
bowing
to
osborn
went
out
when
he
had
gone
osborn
got
up
we
have
not
been
good
friends
kit
he
said
with
some
emotion
old
prejudices
are
hard
to
conquer
but
mine
have
broken
down
at
last
you
have
beaten
me
well
i
suppose
i
would
not
admit
that
the
code
i
clung
to
had
gone
for
good
but
now
i
dropping
out
i
do
know
that
i
could
find
a
better
man
to
step
into
my
place
he
paused
and
gave
kit
his
hand
after
all
tarnside
is
not
lost
to
us
grace
will
follow
me
she
belongs
to
the
new
school
but
i
think
your
children
will
rule
the
old
house
well
then
osborn
advanced
and
kissed
kit
who
went
out
with
her
and
found
grace
waiting
in
the
hall
hayes
has
gone
osborn
remarked
kit
has
forced
him
to
agree
and
your
father
is
reconciled
we
have
had
much
trouble
but
i
think
we
shall
all
be
happy
yet
grace
looked
up
and
her
eyes
shone
ah
she
said
i
knew
long
since
that
kit
was
wonderful
in
one
way
it
would
have
mattered
if
he
had
saved
tarnside
or
not
but
now
you
and
father
know
what
a
dear
he
is
the
end
