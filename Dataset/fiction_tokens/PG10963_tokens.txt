oh
lord
but
my

whence
cometh
thy
sadness
and
wherefore
art
thou
troubled
the
of
the
mass
the
curé
of
althausen
was
reputed
to
be
chaste
was
he
so
really
to
tell
the
truth
i
never
believed
him
so
at
thirty
men
are
not
chaste
they
may
try
to
be
so
they
rarely
succeed
however
that
might
be
he
was
a
singular
man
he
had
a
profound
reverence
for
common
sense
and
it
was
said
that
he
taught
a
strange
doctrine
to
his
flock
for
example
that
a
day
of
work
was
more
pleasing
to
god
than
a
day
of
prayer
that
the
temples
were
for
those
who
labour
not
and
that
a
good
action
was
well
worth
a
mass
he
maintained
too
that
we
purchase
nothing
with
money
in
the
other
world
and
that
the
coins
so
appreciated
among
ourselves
have
no
currency
beyond
the
grave
and
a
hundred
other
oddities
of
this
kind
which
in
the
good
old
times
would
have
brought
him
to
the
stake
the
bishop
had
severely
reprimanded
him
for
all
these
heresies
but
he
seemed
to
pay
no
attention
to
it
every
sunday
from
the
height
of
his
pulpit
he
continued
to
brave
shamelessly
the
thunders
of
his
bishop
and
the
thunders
of
heaven
i
went
one
day
to
hear
him
his
voice
was
sweet
persuasive
with
a
clear
and
harmonious
tone
he
said
simply
love
one
another
that
is
the
true
religion
of
christ
love
one
another
everything
is
there
religion
philosophy
and
morality
charity
properly
understood
that
which
comes
from
the
heart
is
more
pleasing
to
god
than
all
the
prayers
there
are
people
who
in
order
to
pray
neglect
their
home
duties
their
duties
as
wife
and
as
mother
to
them
i
say
of
a
truth
god
remains
deaf
he
wills
before
aught
else
that
you
should
fulfil
your
duties
to
your
own
every
prayer
which
causes
another
to
suffer
is
an
impiety
such
was
pretty
near
the
essence
of
his
sermons
they
were
short
and
simple
no
great
sonorous
words
no
pompous
digressions
no
latin
quotations
which
no
one
would
have
understood
no
declamations
on
our
lady
of
lourdes
or
of
la
salotte
on
the
miracle
of
roses
or
the
immaculate
conception
thus
he
placed
himself
on
a
level
with
the
simple
souls
who
heard
him
addressed
himself
only
to
their
good
sense
and
to
their
heart
and
did
not
waste
their
time
he
thought
that
after
having
worked
hard
throughout
the
week
it
was
well
to
spend
the
sunday
in
rest
and
not
in
fresh
fatigue
but
that
which
struck
me
most
in
him
was
his
intelligent
and
expressive
countenance
and
i
was
astonished
that
a
man
with
such
originality
should
consent
to
vegetate
obscure
and
in
the
care
of
a
poor
village
they
said
he
was
chaste
in
truth
that
must
be
a
task
more
arduous
for
him
than
for
any
other
for
he
bore
on
his
face
the
impress
of
ardent
passions
a
disciple
of
lavater
would
doubtless
have
sought
for
and
found
the
secret
of
hidden
dramas
in
the
fine
pale
face
from
his
looks
now
full
of
feverish
ardour
now
laden
with
sweet
caresses
like
the
limpid
eyes
of
a
bride
the
desires
of
the
flesh
in
rebellion
against
deadly
duty
seemed
to
burst
forth
with
bold
prolific
thoughts
one
saw
at
times
that
his
thoughts
escaped
in
moments
of
forgetfulness
from
the
clerical
fetter
wild
wandering
and
licentious
they
plunged
with
delight
into
the
ocean
of
reverie
they
left
far
behind
them
on
the
misty
shore
our
conventions
our
prejudices
and
our
follies
and
all
those
toils
of
which
beset
and
catch
and
destroy
so
well
the
silly
crowd
and
which
we
call
social
rules
opinion
and
propriety
then
the
priest
was
gone
the
man
alone
remained
the
man
of
thirty
robust
and
full
of
life
and
yearning
for
all
the
joys
of
life
and
beneath
his
chasuble
near
that
altar
laden
with
lustres
and
with
flowers
amidst
the
floods
of
light
and
the
floods
of
perfume
in
that
atmosphere
saturated
with
the
intoxicating
waves
of
incense
and
the
breath
of
maidens
surrounded
by
all
those
women
by
all
these
girls
on
their
knees
before
him
or
hanging
on
his
lips
before
all
these
modest
or
burning
looks
fixed
upon
his
gaze
a
strange
sensation
rose
to
his
brain
the
perspiration
stood
upon
his
forehead
he
blushed
and
grew
pale
by
turns
a
shiver
ran
through
his
frame
and
trying
to
subdue
the
ardour
of
his
gaze
he
turned
towards
the
crowd
of
young
girls
and
said
to
them
in
a
trembling
voice
cum
spiritu
answered
the
choir
of
maidens
oh
how
willingly
instead
of
the
name
of
god
would
he
have
cast
to
them
his
heart
ii
the
confessional
in
the
course
of
the
holy
missions
to
which
i
have
consecrated
a
great
portion
of
my
life
i
have
often
come
across
upright
souls
disposed
to
make
great
progress
in
perfection
if
they
had
found
a
skilful
director
the
rev
father
scaromelli
spiritual
however
almost
in
spite
of
myself
i
was
interested
in
this
young
priest
and
although
disposed
to
believe
that
he
was
a
knave
like
the
rest
i
was
sensible
of
something
in
him
so
upright
and
so
loyal
that
i
was
from
the
very
first
prejudiced
in
his
favour
and
besides
these
flashes
of
fiery
passion
which
at
times
betrayed
him
could
they
serve
as
an
accusation
against
him
could
one
take
offence
at
his
not
having
completely
stifled
at
thirty
years
the
fierce
passions
of
youth
and
his
violent
desires
was
it
not
a
proof
on
the
contrary
of
his
victorious
struggles
and
of
his
energy
and
even
though
he
should
succumb
before
the
imperious
needs
of
potent
nature
which
would
be
the
more
culpable
he
or
the
women
who
surrounded
him
enveloped
him
with
their
gaze
encompassed
him
with
their
seductions
he
or
the
husbands
and
fathers
who
seemed
tacitly
to
say
to
him
you
are
young
ardent
fall
of
passion
and
vigour
there
is
my
daughter
there
is
my
wife
i

into

looks
read
in
their
soul
listen
month
to
month
to
their
most
secret
confidences
but
beware
of
touching
their
lips
fools
and
when
the
priest
succumbs
and
their
shame
is
noised
abroad
they
make
a
great
uproar
and
complain
to
all
the
echoes
instead
of
bowing
their
head
and
humbly
saying
what
silly
fool
you
cast
the
modesty
of
your
young
wife
and
the
virginity
of
your
daughter
as
food
for
that
envious
celibate
you
leave
them
alone
in
the
mysterious
of
the
confessional
with
no
obstacle
between
his
burning
lust
and
the
object
of
that
lost
between
those
mouths
which
speak
so
low
what
will
stop

his
duty

himself
laughable
obstacles
fragile
plank
on
which
you
place
your
honour
her
own
virtue
trust
not
to
it
overmuch
for
he
will
know
how
to
lead
her
to
the
will
of
his
appetite
he
will
form
her
in
such
a
way
that
she
will
pass
by
all
the
roads
by
which
he
will
wish
to
guide
her
it
is
a
gate
which
he
will
contrive
sooner
or
later
to

however
it
may
be
bolted

it

guarded

the

the
pretty
parsonage
encircled
with
verdure
with
its
white
pigeons
cooing
on

roof
assumes
to
the
sun
a
saucy
air

the
parsonage
is
seated
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
and
overlooks
a
part
of
the
village
and
of
the
plain
the
traveller
perceives
from
far
its
white
outline
in
the
midst
of
a
nest
of
verdure
and
feels
delighted
at
the
view
nothing
more
simple
than
this
peaceful
house
a
single
story
above
the
with
four
windows
from
which
the
panes
shine
cheerfully
in
the
first
rays

sun
and
upon
the
roof
two
attics
with
pointed
gable
the
door
which
one
reaches
by
a
broad
stone
stair
is
framed
by
two
vines
their
vigorous
branches
stretching
up
to
the
side
of
the
windows
yielding
to

old
church
with
its
stained
walls
on
which
the
ivy
clings
and
its
pointed
belfry
the
distance
between
is
partly
filled
by
several
rows
of
which
seen
from
a
distance
give
to
the
parsonage
the
calm
and
cheerful
look
of
those
peaceful
retreats
where
we
sometimes
dream
of
burying
our
existence

says
the
oh
how
happy
must
be
the
dweller
in
this
calm
abode

might
enter
he
was
welcome
the
door
was
open
to
all
and
this
house
like
that
of
the
wise
man
seemed
to
be
of
glass
and
all
the
women
young
or
old
knew
hour
by
hour
how
their
curé
spent
his
time
and
in
spite
of
all
the
perseverance
which
according
to
principle
they
had
applied
to
discover
some
mystery
in
his
life
or
the
knot
of
a
secret
intrigue
they
acknowledged
unanimously
that
no
one
could
give
less
hold
for
scandal
than
he
every
day
when
he
had
said
mass
pruned
his
trees
watered
his
flowers
visited
some
poor
or
sick
person
he
shut
himself
up
with
his
books
and
lived
with
them
till
the
evening
until
his
servant
came
and
said
to
him
it
is
time
for
supper
then
he
rose
ate
his
supper
in
silence
after
putting
aside
the
portion
for
the
poor
and
then
returned
to
his
books
that
was
all
his
life
on
sunday
if
the
weather
was
fine
he
took
his
breviary
and
walked
with
slow
steps
along
the
the
children
would
stop
their
games
and
run
forward
to
meet
him
in
order
to
receive
a
caress
from
him
while
the
young
girls
whispered
together
and
seemed
to
avoid
him
the
bolder
ones
met
his
gaze
with
a
blush
perhaps
they
too
would
have
liked
just
as
the
little
children
to
receive
a
caress
from
the
handsome
curé
of
althausen
but
he
passed
on
without
ever
stopping
answering
their
timid
salutations
with
an
almost
frigid
gravity
he
acted
wisely
he
was
full
of
distrust
of
himself
and
kept
himself
in
prudent
reserve
in
face
of
the
enemy
for
he
knew
full
well
that
the
enemy
was
there
in
these
sweet
woman
eyes
and
those
smiles
which
wished
him
welcome
then
the
pagan
intoxications
of
the
catholic
rites
were
no
more
surrounding
him
to
him
and
betray
the
trouble
of
his
heart
and
the
straying
of
his
thoughts
and
if
he
felt
affected
before
the
smiles
of
these
marriageable
girls
he
armed
himself
with
force
sufficient
to
thrust
back
carefully
to
his
inmost
being
his
boldness
and
his
desires
it
was
no
more
the
ardent
passionate
man
who
disclosed
himself
sometimes
in
rapid
moments
of
forgetfulness
it
was
the
priest
austere
and
calm
the
functionary
salaried
by
the
state
to
teach
the
religion
of
the
state
iv
expectation
and
the
days
and
the
hours
glided
on
and
withdrawn
within
itself
affected
by
sorrows
and
joys
unknown
the
soul
stretched
its
mysterious
wing
over
a
new
life
soon
to
dawn
lamennais
voix
de
one
of
his
greatest
pleasures
was
to
plunge
into
the
woods
which
surround
the
village
he
sought
silence
and
solitude
there
and
when
he
heard
the
steps
of
a
keeper
or
of
some
pedestrian
or
even
the
happy
voices
of
young
couples
calling
one
another
he
concealed
himself
behind
the
masses
of
foliage
and
hid
himself
with
a
kind
of
shame
like
a
criminal
he
wished
to
be
alone
completely
alone
so
as
to
dream
at
his
ease
then
he
stretched
himself
in
the
sun
on
the
warm
grass
opened
his
breviary
the
discreet
confidant
of
all
wandering
thoughts
the
screen
for
the
priest
looks
and
thoughts
and
listened
to
the
insects
hum
he
followed
the
goings
and
comings
of
an
ant
or
the
capricious
flight
of
a
then
with
his
eyes
lost
in
space
immersed
in
the
profundity
of
nature
he
dreamed
one
could
have
seen
by
his
smile
that
he
was
wandering
in
spirit
in
the
laughing
and
garden
of
hope
pausing
here
and
there
on
rosy
illusions
and
fair
chimeras
like
a
butterfly
on
flowers
they
were
delicious
hours
which
he
passed
thus
full
of
forgetfulness
and
indolence
he
enjoyed
the
present
moment
the
present
poor
humble
and
obscure
but
which
held
neither
disquietude
nor
care
sometimes
regrets
for
a
past
of
which
no
one
was
aware
came
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
his
dreams
but
he
drove
them
for
away
saying
like
werther
the
past
is
past
the
hand
of
time
revolved
without
his
giving
heed
and
often
night
surprised
him
in
his
fantastic
reveries
the
good
bad
been
sorely
puzzled
by
these
solitary
walks
in
the
depths
of
the
woods
they
talked
at
first
of
some
scandalous
intrigue
and
the
curé
had
no
difficulty
in
discovering
that
he
was
followed
and
watched
by
rigid
parishioners
anxious
about
his
morality
and
his
virtue
more
than
once
through
the
foliage
he
believed
he
saw
vigilant
sentinels
who
watched
him
carefully
lost
labour
never
did
those
who
tried
with
such
unwearied
perseverance
to
detect
his
secret
amours
have
the
pleasure
of
beholding
whom
they
would
have
been
so
happy
to
cover
with
shame
and
scorn
they
were
obliged
to
renounce
it
for
his
mistress
then
was
that
admirable
fairy
invisible
and
dumb
to
the
common
herd
who
displays
her
beauties
to
the
gaze
of
a
chosen
race
alone
as
she
murmurs
her
divine
and
chaste
sonnets
in
their
ear
it
was
nature
all
radiant
which
caressed
his
brow
with
the
breeze
which
sang
by
his
ear
with
the
mysterious
harmony
of
the
woods
which
gladdened
his
sight
with
the
flower
of
the
fields
the
verdant
meadow
the
golden
harvest
his
loves
were
the
hollow
path
which
is
lost
in
the
mountain
the
old
willow
which
leans
over
the
edge
of
the
pool
the
sparrow
which
chatters
among
the
leaves
the
splendours
of
the
starry
sky
the
magic
mirages
of
the
evening
they
were
all
the
melodies
which
poets
have
made
to
vibrate
on
the
strings
of
lyres
and
in
those
moments
of
delicious
ecstasy
he
forgot
the
vexations
the
littlenesses
and
the
miseries
of
the
world
and
if
anyone
had
asked
him
what
was
the
aim
of
his
life
he
would
have
replied
like
anaxagoras
to
love
nature
and
to
contemplate
the
sky
but
among
his
uncouth
surroundings
who
would
have
been
capable
of
understanding
these
sweet
pleasures
and
that
of
soul
and
brain
by
means
of
which
he
sought
to
benumb
his
senses
and
to
change
the
current
of
his
heart
that
heart
which
like
the
body
has
its
imperious
needs
he
had
reached
that
fatal
epoch
when
man
experiences
an
insatiable
hunger
for
love
and
for
want
of
a
woman
will
nourish
some
monstrous
fantasy
or
even
like
the
prisoner
of

emanation
of

forces
continually
takes
place
from
the
eyes
of
impassioned
persons

lovers
or
of
lascivious
women
which
communicates
insensibly
to
those
who
listen
to
or
behold
them
the
same
agitation
by
which
they
are
affected
restif

one
afternoon
while
returning
to
the
village
the
curé
chanced
to
meet
a
young
girl
who
was
unknown
to
him
she
was
but
poorly
dressed
and
her
shoes
were
white
with
dust
but
youth
and
gaiety
shone
forth
beneath
the
glow
of
her
cheeks
her
blue
eye
sparkled
under
the
dark
arch
of
her
eyebrows
and
the
voluptuous
opulence
of
her
shape
made
one
forget
the
poverty
of
her
dress
from
her
straw
hat
with
its
faded
ribbons
escaped
heavy
tresses
which
shone
like
gold
bending
over
his
breviary
the
curé
passed
casting
a
sidelong
look
one
of
those
priestly
looks
which
see
without
being
seen
but
the
stranger
compelled
him
to
raise
his
head
she
had
stood
still
and
was
fixing
on
him
smiling
a
bright
and
confident
look
on
seeing
this
the
curé
stood
still
also
certainly
in
the
white
flock
of
his
congregation
he
counted
just
as
lovely
creatures
every
sunday
he
encountered
just
as
provoking
smiles
nevertheless
he
was
troubled
he
felt
a
secret
flame
course
through
his
veins
a
kind
of
charm
emanated
front
this
girl
he
remembered
reading
that
magnetic
currents
flow
forth
from
certain
women
which
inflame
the
senses
and
he
took
a
step
backwards
but
the
charm
operated
in
spite
of
himself
his
eyes
remained
fixed
on
the
seductive
outlines
of
the
figure
of
the
unknown
she
enquired
of
him
politely
the
way
to
the
in
pointing
it
out
to
her
the
curé
perhaps
displayed
more
earnestness
than
was
necessary
he
even
took
a
few
steps
with
her
as
far
as
the
entrance
to
the
village
then
he
returned
home
thinking
of
this
pretty
girl
during
supper
his
servant
told
him
that
some
mountebanks
had
arrived
in
the
village
and
that
they
were
going
to
give
a
performance
the
same
evening
in
the
in
fact
a
drum
was
heard
beating
the
call
and
the
hoarse
voice
of
the
clown
announcing
a
grand
acrobatic
spectacle
accompanied
with
dances
and
followed
by
a
pantomime
involuntarily
the
curé
thought
turned
to
the
stranger
he
went
upstairs
into
his
study
and
behind
his
shutters
he
could
take
part
in
the
spectacle
as
he
expected
the
pretty
girl
was
there
and
seen
from
this
distance
in
the
night
by
a
few
smoky
lamps
with
her
little
bodice
of
velvet
her
gauze
skirt
spangled
with
gold
her
tights
she
was
really
charming
at
that
moment
she
was
dancing
with
wonderful
lightness
and
grace
some
lascivious
fandango
while
she
accompanied
herself
with
the
castanets
she
was
smiling
at
the
crowd
delighting
in
the
effect
which
she
knew
how
to
produce
with
her
sparkling
eye
and
her
white
teeth
and
her
rosy
lips
and
the
curé
was
intoxicated
by
that
smile
then
he
cast
his
eyes
over
the
rough
crowd
and
ha
was
grieved
at
so
much
cost
for
such
an
audience
ante
he
murmured
ante
in
order
to
admire
her
better
he
had
taken
a
and
lost
none
of
her
gestures
her
bosom
was
boldly
bared
and
he
feasted
his
eyes
upon
the
sweet
furrow
of
her
breasts
he
followed
the
delicious
outline
of
her
leg
and
found
his
heart
melting
before
the
undulating
movements
of
her
graceful
bust
and
her
sturdy
hips
he
abruptly
left
the
window
took
up
a
book
at
random
and
tried
to
read
but
this
was
in
vain
his
eyes
only
were
reading
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
they
were
in
the
which
was
in
frolic
with
the
dancer
he
wished
to
stop
this
libertine
thought
he
read
aloud
the
fall
is
great
after
great
efforts
the
soul
risen
so
high
in
heroism
and
holiness
falls
very
heavily
to
the
earth
sick
and
embittered
it
plunges
into
evil
with
a
savage
hunger
as
though
to
avenge
itself
for
having
believed
at
another
time
he
would
have
said
it
is
a
warning
but
he
saw
not
the
warning
he
only
saw
the
dancer
and
he
murmured
how
beautiful
is
she
he
took
the
hundred
paces
round
his
table
but
his
body
only
was
there
his
thoughts
always
were
hovering
on
the
round
the
spangled
petticoat
he
returned
to
the
window
all
was
over
the
lamps
were
put
out
the
crowd
was
slowly
dispersing
five
or
six
inquisitive
ones
were
standing
round
the
heavy
carriage
of
the
company
from
which
some
gleam
of
light
escaped
he
remained
a
long
time
leaning
on
his
elbow
at
his
window
looking
at
the
stars
and
listening
mechanically
to
all
the
noises
outside
the
became
empty
only
the
stamping
of
the
horses
was
to
be
heard
fastened
near
by
in
the
thick
shade
of
the
old
a
slender
thread
of
light
again
filtered
up
to
hint
vi
the
look
his
pupils
glowed
in
the
dim
twilight
like
burning
coals
léon
claudel
it
was
like
a
lover
attracting
him
a
magic
thread
which
fastened
yonder
was
unwinding
itself
to
his
eye
he
could
not
withdraw
it
thence
and
armed
with
his
glass
he
tried
to
reach
the
bottom
of
the
mysterious
light
two
or
three
times
he
saw
a
figure
which
he
thought
he
recognized
pass
and
repass
in
the
lighted
square
then
the
devil
tempted
him
like
jesus
on
the
mountain
he
did
not
show
him
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
but
he
gave
him
a
glimpse
of
the
mountebank
undressed
go
not
there
his
good
angel
cried
to
him
but
the
curé
turned
a
deaf
ear
he
went
down
noiselessly
from
his
room
and
ventured
into
the
in
order
to
approach
the
carriage
he
displayed
all
the
strategy
of
a
skilful
general
he
first
walked
the
length
of
the
parsonage
then
crossed
the
then
little
by
little
artfully
disappeared
beneath
the
plate
i
the
look
no
one
could
have
detected
him
plunging
his
burning
gaze
into
the
depth
of
the
little
room
where
the
fair
dancer
stripped
of
her
tights
appeared
to
him
illustration
the
house
on
wheels
was
only
a
few
paces
away
silent
motionless
crammed
up
within
those
ten
feet
of
planks
was
perceptible
an
excess
of
lives
passions
miseries
joys
of
comedies
and
dramas
quite
a
world
in
miniature
breathings
and
rustlings
issued
now
and
then
from
this
living
coffin
it
wan
the
heavy
slumber
of
fatigue
of
fever
or
of
drink
one
window
was
lighted
still
and
the
curtain
allowed
a
room
to
be
seen
the
size
of
a
he
passed
slowly
by
and
gave
a
look
a
strange
emotion
seized
him
he
would
have
wished
not
to
have
seen
and
he
felt
full
of
a
delicious
trouble
at
having
seen
he
looked
round
him
with
alarm
he
was
quite
alone
no
one
had
detected
him
no
one
could
have
detected
him
plunging
his
burning
gaze
into
the
depth
of
the
little
room
where
the
fair
dancer
stripped
of
her
tights
appeared
to
him
and
dazzling
like
a
goddess
of
rubens
vii
the
salute
she
is
fair
she
is
white
and
her
golden
hair
sweetly
frames
her
rosy
face
the
limpid
look
of
her
azure
eyes
beguiles
near
as
much
as
her
lip
channard
the
next
day
from
break
of
dawn
the
strolling
players
were
already
making
their
preparations
for
departure
he
saw
the
fair
dancer
again
no
longer
had
she
on
her
gauze
dress
with
golden
spangles
nor
the
tights
which
displayed
her
shape
nor
her
glittering
diadem
nor
the
imitation
pearls
in
her
hair
she
had
resumed
her
poor
dress
of
printed
cotton
her
darned
stockings
and
her
coarse
shoes
but
there
was
still
her
blue
eye
with
its
strange
light
her
pleasant
face
her
silky
hair
falling
in
thick
tresses
on
her
sunburnt
neck
and
beneath
her
cotton
bodice
the
figure
of
an
empress
was
outlined
with
the
same
opulence
a
knot
of
women
was
there
laughing
and
talking
scandal
what
were
these
stupid
peasants
laughing
at
at
length
the
heavy
vehicle
began
to
move
drawn
by
two
horses
the
fair
girl
is
at
the
little
window
and
watches
inquisitive
and
smiling
the
silly
scoffing
crowd
pass
on
daughter
of
bohemia
and
despise
these
men
who
jest
at
your
poverty
these
women
who
cast
a
look
of
scorn
and
hate
they
scorn
and
hate
you
because
they
have
not
your
splendid
hair
nor
the
brightness
of
your
eyes
nor
your
white
teeth
nor
your
fresh
smile
nor
your
suppleness
grace
and
vigour
nor
your
bewitching
shape
despise
them
in
your
turn
but
envy
them
not
them
who
despise
and
envy
you
thus
the
curé
murmured
to
himself
as
the
carriage
was
passing
by
she
is
there
still
at
her
little
window
like
a
youthfull
picture
by
greuze
she
lifts
her
eyes
and
recognizes
the
priest
and
bows
with
that
smile
which
has
already
so
affected
him
what
grace
in
that
simple
gesture
what
promises
in
those
gentle
eyes
in
the
midst
of
the
hostile
scornful
looks
of
that
foolish
crowd
she
has
met
a
friendly
face
she
has
read
sympathy
and
perhaps
a
secret
admiration
on
the
intelligent
countenance
of
the
priest
the
curé
replied
to
her
salute
and
for
a
long
while
his
gaze
pursued
the
carriage
meanwhile
the
good
ladies
whispered
among
themselves
and
said
to
one
another
with
a
scandalized
air
did
you
see
he
bowed
to
the
mountebank
viii
the
fever
who
has
not
had
those
troubled
nights
when
the
storm
rages
within
when
the
soul
miserably
oppressed
with
shameful
desires
floats
in
the
mud
of
a
swamp
michelet
he
was
quite
aware
of
his
imprudence
but
was
unable
to
withdraw
his
eyes
from
the
road
and
his
thoughts
still
followed
the
carriage
long
after
it
had
disappeared
behind
the
tall
poplars
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
a
portion
of
himself
which
was
going
away
for
ever
what
was
the
madman
then
beginning
to
cast
his
heart
thus
on
the
roads
and
could
he
feel
smitten
by
this
creature
whom
he
had
scarcely
met
no
it
was
not
she
whom
he
loved
but
she
had
just
made
the
cup
run
over
she
or
another
it
was
indifferent
to
him
his
altered
feelings
of
desire
needed
at
length
to
drink
freely
he
was
thirsty
what
signified
to
him
the
vessel
hitherto
he
had
only
felt
that
ordinary
confusion
which
the
chaste
man
experiences
in
presence
of
the
woman
for
hitherto
his
sight
bad
only
paused
complacently
upon
pretty
fresh
faces
and
if
his
thought
wandered
beyond
he
drove
it
back
with
care
to
his
very
inmost
being
but
now
that
he
had
seen
the
naked
breast
of
a
pretty
girl
that
he
had
relished
it
with
his
gaze
embraced
it
with
his
desire
that
he
had
yielded
to
a
fatal
forgetfulness
his
flesh
so
long
subdued
and
humiliated
profited
by
that
moment
of
error
and
subdued
him
in
its
turn
a
kind
of
frenzy
had
taken
possession
of
his
being
in
a
moment
and
in
the
sleepless
night
which
he
had
just
passed
he
had
given
himself
up
to
an
absolute
orgy
in
his
imagination
that
wandering
girl
who
had
just
disappeared
had
carried
away
his
modesty
he
felt
his
heart
beating
for
her
but
he
felt
that
his
heart
was
beating
for
all
alike
girls
or
women
he
wanted
them
all
he
defiled
them
all
with
his
thoughts
and
so
after
ten
years
of
struggles
the
virtue
of
the
curé
of
althausen
dissolved
one
evening
before
the
naked
breast
of
a
like
snow
before
the
sun
that
day
was
a
sunday
and
as
he
did
not
come
downstairs
his
servant
came
to
warn
him
that
the
time
for
mass
was
drawing
near
she
stood
struck
with
the
strange
look
on
his
countenance
at
the
fatigue
displayed
on
his
features
and
anxiously
enquired
of
him
the
cause
the
curé
assured
her
that
she
was
mistaken
that
he
bad
never
felt
better
but
at
the
same
time
he
gave
a
glance
at
his
mirror
he
was
frightened
at
his
face
and
he
remained
a
long
time
thoughtful
contemplating
the
gloomy
fire
of
his
own
look
that
sinister
countenance
seemed
to
him
to
presage
some
approaching
calamity
thus
there
are
men
whom
fate
has
marked
on
the
forehead
with
a
fatal
stamp
the
mysterious
sign
is
not
displayed
at
every
time
and
before
all
but
at
certain
epochs
of
life
when
the
unknown
breath
caresses
the
predestinated
or
cursed
head
the
mark
all
at
once
appeals
like
a
tawny
light
in
the
depth
of
night
a
curse
fatality
has
moulded
that
man
brain
it
has
left
its
potent
impress
on
his
skull
with
what
seal
then
am
i
marked
he
cried
is
it
that
of
reprobation
which
god
has
stamped
upon
my
face
no
simpleton
that
thou
art
it
is
the
phosphorus
of
thy
brain

catches
fire

ix
during
vespers
there
is
a
beautiful
girl
of
sixteen
white
as
milk
rosy
as
a
fresh
as
a
spring
morning
and
chaste
as
vesta
delvau
fumier
he
went
up
into
the
pulpit
and
preached
a
sermon
on
this
text
blessed
are
the
pure
in
heart
he
had
prepared
it
the
day
before
previous
to
the
arrival
of
that
enchanting
player
and
his
thoughts
had
been
since
then
too
occupied
with
very
different
subjects
for
him
to
search
for
another
theme
bitter
mockery
what
could
he
say
to
these
good
people
about
hearts
pure
and
chaste
he
tried
all
the
same
and
said
some
excellent
things
he
spoke
above
all
about
temptation
which
following
the
expression
of
a
father
of
the
church
is
only
to
commence
with
an
ant
which
tickles
and
finishes
by
becoming
a
devouring
lion
alas
he
said
how
many
without
meaning
it
have
been
thus
devoured
beginning
perhaps
with
this
pious
individual
his
sermon
took
great
effect
an
old
woman
wept
and
several
members
of
the
congregation
appeared
to
sigh
and
think
that
it
was
a
long
time
since
they
had
been
devoured
thus
he
had
an
inclination
to
laugh
as
he
came
down
from
the
pulpit
at
the
words
which
he
had
just
uttered
on
purity
of
heart
and
he
wondered
that
he
had
been
able
to
bring
so
much
conviction
and
warmth
to
bear
upon
a
subject
to
which
he
was
henceforth
completely
a
stranger
his
own
scepticism
terrified
him
and
he
saw
that
he
had
taken
a
long
step
into
evil
nevertheless
he
did
concern
himself
at
that
and
from
his
place
near
the
pulpit
he
turned
his
impassioned
gaze
with
more
assurance
on
the
group
of
young
girls
passion
is
a
brutal
level
which
equalizes
us
all
there
remained
in
him
nothing
more
of
the
priest
there
only
remained
the
man
full
of
desires
and
he
flung
his
desires
in
riot
upon
that
gyneceum
which
he
thought
belonged
to
him
in
certain
village
churches
all
the
young
girls
are
placed
apart
near
the
choir
sometimes
even
in
the
choir
itself
under
the
eyes
of
the
priest
as
if
they
wished
to
leave
the
most
convenient
choice
to
that
never
satiated
priapus
the
handsome
curé
of
althausen
made
his
choice
therefore
at
his
ease
and
without
the
least
shame
this
one
was
fair
and
pale
that
other
dark
and
high
in
colour
this
one
was
thin
and
delicate
that
one
fat
and
plump
this
one
was
prettier
that
other
more
graceful
he
knew
not
upon
which
to
stop
he
would
have
wished
for
them
all
for
they
all
had
that
provoking
beauty
which
pleases
the
devil
so
much
exuberant
youth
and
he
could
not
grow
weary
of
contemplating
all
these
fresh
faces
his
look
more
than
once
encountered
sweet
looks
and
then
he
experienced
a
delicious
shock
which
stirred
his
heart
it
was
not
only
the
faces
which
excited
his
longings
in
spite
of
himself
the
opulent
breast
of
the
fair
player
entered
his
imagination
and
his
thoughts
seemed
to
search
each
one
neckerchief
seeking
this
powerful
nourishment
for
his
appetite
he
bad
tried
to
drive
away
these
abominable
desires
but
it
was
in
vain
the
forbidden
fruit
was
there
and
something
seemed
to
tell
him
that
he
had
only
to
stretch
out
his
hand
to
seize
it
as
he
tried
to
escape
from
this
diabolical
hallucination
he
remarked
all
at
once
in
the
gallery
set
apart
for
the
wives
of
the
principal
inhabitants
a
young
girl
a
stranger
whose
beauty
struck
him
she
was
pale
and
dark
and
her
full
lips
of
a
brilliant
red
were
lightly
pencilled
with
a
black
down
her
deep
burning
eyes
darted
flames
and
were
fixed
on
the
priest
with
a
persistency
which
made
him
blush
the
erotic
fever
which
had
possessed
him
disappeared
at
once
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
and
of
his
secret
thoughts
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
stranger
read
to
the
bottom
of
his
soul
this
flaming
look
which
he
had
caught
sight
of
weighed
upon
him
like
remorse
in
the
evening
at
the
he
saw
again
the
same
face
and
the
same
burning
eyes
fastened
on
his
own
but
be
thought
he
discovered
that
there
was
nothing
terrible
about
them
and
that
what
in
his
trouble
he
had
taken
for
inquisition
and
wrath
might
in
reality
be
nothing
but
tenderness
and
sweetness
he
made
skilful
enquiries
regarding
the
stranger
she
was
mademoiselle
suzanne
durand
who
had
just
completed
her
education
at
the
daughter
of
captain
durand
a
bad
parishioner
his
servant
told
him
who
paid
little
regard
to
the
service
and
treated
the
priests

the

have
always
made
me
laugh

where
beneath
the
mask
of
the
venerable

the
hood
of

austere
monk
i
discovered
the

stop

their
clamours
and
i
shall
continue

have
undertaken

some
sincere
persons
may
object
what
sort
then
is
this
cynical
priest
which
you
display
to
us
is
there
nothing
then
remaining
to
him
and
in
default
of
modesty
and
morality
in
default
of
his
energy
which
has
foundered
thus
all
at
once
could
he
not
still
lay
hold
of
the
wrecks
of
faith
faith

had
fled
away
long
ago
since
the
day
when
he
had
laid
aside
his
dress
of
catechumen
and
initiated
in
the
secrets
of
the
sanctuary
he
had
laid
hand
on
the
priestly
jugglings
then
he
had
been
filled
with
an
infinite
sorrow
but
he
had
prudently
repressed
it
deep
within
and
in
this
centre
of
devout
hypocrisy
and
holy
intrigue
he
had
covered
himself
again
like
all
the

with
a
varnish

it
saturated
with
bitterness
disgust
weariness
and
regret
and
in
the
midst
of
all
that
something
unknown
was
springing
up
it
was
like
a
germ
of
hope
which
all
at
once
had
risen
out
of
nothingness
a
fleeting
light
which
flickered
in
the
dense
gloom
of
his
life
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
voice
at
some
distance
a
fresh
gay
melodious
voice
to
which
a
deeper
note
was
answering
spring
youth
and
love
were
mingling
their
accents
together
between
the
foliage
he
saw
them
slowly
passing
they
did
not
see
him
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
themselves
arm
in
arm
with
joined
hands
their
faces
together
they
passed
along
with
bright
looks
and
open
hearts
rejoicing
in
the
seventh
heaven
now
and
again
they
stopped
and
he
all
in
play
took
hold
of
her
thick
knot
of
hair
drew
her
head
backwards
and
gave
her
a
long
kiss
on
the
lips
he
did
not
tire
of
it
but
she
pushed
him
back
with
all
her
strength
putting
her
hand
on
his
mouth
and
saying
to
him
that
enough
naughty
boy
that
enough
the
curé
knew
them
well
she
was
the
best
and
prettiest
girl
in
his
congregation
and
he
the
happy
rogue
sang
in
the
choir
and
he
began
to
envy
the
happiness
of
this
rustic
he
would
have
wished
to
be
for
a
moment
this
rude
ignorant
peasant
and
who
knows
for
a
moment
why
not
always
would
he
not
be
happier
going
each
morning
to
till
the
fruitful
soil
to
sow
the
furrow
and
then
to
cut
the
sheaves
of
the
golden
harvest
than
to
vegetate
as
he
was
casting
his
sterile
grain
upon
arid
souls
after
the
hard
toil
of
the
day
when
he
returned
in
the
evening
to
his
roof
of
thatch
he
would
meet
with
a
smile
of
welcome
the
smile
of
a
loved
wife
which
would
compensate
him
for
his
fatigues
he
followed
them
with
his
eyes
full
of
envy
and
bitterness
at
heart
and
when
they
had
buried
themselves
behind
the
young
underwood
when
he
no
longer
heard
the
sound
of
steps
or
fresh
bursts
of
laughter
he
rose
and
sadly
resumed
his
way
to
the
village
evening
had
come
the
twilight
was
stretching
its
dark
veil
over
all
the
peasants
dressed
in
their
sunday
clothes
were
chatting
on
their
while
they
waited
for
supper
near
the
inns
there
rose
the
confused
sound
of
gamblers
voices
and
drunkards
songs
but
here
and
there
through
the
windows
he
saw
the
bright
fire
of
blazing
merrily
on
the
hearth
while
the
mother
or
the
eldest
daughter
poured
the
steaming
soup
into
the
large
plates
ranged
on
the
white
wood
table
he
saw
it
all
and
he
walked
with
slow
steps
to
his
solitary
abode
he
thought
of
his
life
wasted
of
the
years
of
his
prime
which
were
passing
away
without
leaving
any
more
traces
than
the
skimming
of
the
wing
leaves
upon
the
verdant
brook
oh
the
fleeting
time
which
carries
all
away
the
hour
which
glides
away
dull
and
empty
the
barren
youth
which
flies
and
the
white
hairs
which
come
with
disillusion
discouragement
and
despair
stay
stay
oh
youth
stay
but
another
day
but
what
matters
his
youth
to
him
what
joys
has
it
brought
him
what
pleasures
has
he
tasted
has
he
breathed
the
burning
breath
of
life
of
that
fair
life
at
twenty
which
unfolds
like
a
ripe
pomegranate
and
casts
to
the
warm
sun
its
treasures
and
its
perfumes

sat
by

began
to
think
with
terror
of
the
eternal
solitude
of

had
said
to
himself
very
often
that
he
had
chosen
the
wrong
road
that
this
arid
and
desolate
path
was
not
the
one
needful
to
his

soul
that
the
hopes
with
which
he
had
formerly
been
deluded
were
falsehoods
in

and
that
the

they
had
made
him
believe
that

loved
with
such
ardour

his

empty

in
the
heart
of
fools
for
the
amazement
of

how
willingly
would

have
replaced
the
vision
of
this
chimerical
phantom
with
the
likeness
of
some
young
girl
with
sweet
look
and
smile
full
of
promise

the
burning

was
what

called
in
a

a
smart
soldier
which
means
to
say
a
clean
soldier
and
still
one
of
his
most
important
occupations
was
to
brush
his
things
the
son
of
peasants
without
patronage

or
backstairs
influence
he
had
raised
himself
a
rare
and
difficult

proud
of
himself

was
excessively

this
stiffness
and
severity
he
had
brought

very
young
a
rapid

quickly
deceived

the
lucky
millionaire
successively
come
into

these
sprigs
of
lofty
lineage
full
of
brilliancy

naturally
eclipsed
the
modest
qualities
of
the
obscure
upstart
soldier
spending
their
life
in
cafés
overwhelmed
with

loved
by

they
laughed
among
themselves

all
the
of

treated
as

had
respected
become
an
object
of

most
cherished
convictions
turned
into
ridicule

when
they
hear
an
unseemly
oath

impious

tremble

pray
heaven

asked
himself
if

overthrown

was
from
this
period

the
crabbed
character
dated

he
was
known
he
passed
a
long
season
thus
full
of

the

arrived
that

which
all
the

look
forward

pruning

watering

great

were
there

warm
ourselves

with

it
glitters
like
a
sun
for
it
contains
the
magic
word
which
out
of
nothing
is
going
to
make
you
everything
to
draw
you
out
of
the
obscure
ranks
to
place
you
in
the
brilliant
phalanx
which
from
a
passive
despised
instrument
is
going
to
create
you
an
active
and
respected
head
how
you
are
dazzled
as
you
open
it
with
what
palpitations
and
haste
you
look
for
the
blessed
page
skipping
the

glancing
over
the
ranks
flying
over
the
names
in

to

you

where
it

what

that

it

it
is
at

young
and
old

all
were
twenty
once
and
meanwhile
and
meanwhile
the
best
days
of
your
youth
are
lost
in
barren
vulgar
at
times
repulsive
occupations
your
spirit
is
extinguished
your
responsibility
as
an
intelligent
man
is
destroyed
at
settled
hours
by
the
sound
of
the
bugle
or
of
the
trumpet
those
flourishes
of
gilded
servitude
and
beneath
the
heavy
hammer
of
passive
obedience
your
temples
are
already
growing
grey
you
have
wrinkles
on
your

and
on
your
heart
for
you
have
reached
that
part
of
the
cup
of
life
at
which
one
drinks
little
else
than
bitterness
but
you
forget
all
that
a
new
life
full
of
enchantment
is
beginning
you
are
an
officer
an
officer
ah
those
who
have
never
borne
the
harness
do
not
know
what
that
magic
word
contains
but
you
you
know
it
and
you
took
at

name
you
spell
each
letter
of
it
and
you
say
at

it
is

it
is

i

ten

fifteen
years
of
struggles
tribulation
obstacles
humiliations
devotion
dangers
in

to
reach
the
salary
of
a
clerk
but
the
old
captain
what
was
he
looking
for
in
the
columns
of
the
service
newspaper
he
had
nothing
to
expect
no
new
promotion
could
swell
his
aged
breast
he
had
completed
his
career
like
a
rejected
charger
whose
ear
has
been
slit
or
whose
right
flank
has
been
branded
he
had
been
laid
aside
for
ever
henceforth
he
had
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
plant
his
cabbages
until
his
legs
were
seized
by
anchylosis
absolutely
forgotten
and
so
with
all
those
who
go
away
amidst
the
thousand
incidents
of
military
life
so
filled
in
its
leisure
and
so
empty
in
its
employments
has
anyone
the
time
to
give
a
thought
to
the
absent
one
who
must
return
no
more
his
place
is
taken
a
new
face
is
seated
there
where
we
used
to
see
him
and
his
is
no
longer
familiar
to
us
a
few
years
hence
and
his
name
will
be
known
no
more
the
army
is
for
the
young
but
does
he
forget
does
a
man
forget
his
youth
his
glory
his
dearest
memories
his
whole
life
retired
into
some
country
nook
completely
buried
in
an
obscure
or
become
the
modest
citizen
of
some
provincial
city
the
old
officer
follows
afar
off
with
solicitude
and
envy
the
different
fortunes
of
his
brothers
in
arms
living
ever
in
thought
amidst
that
forgetful
and
ungrateful
family
which
he
loves
as
much
as
his
own
the
regiment
and
that
is
why
you
brave
veterans
understand
it
well
that
is
why

himself

lie
and
deceive
barnum

de
but
as
i
have
said
he
was
a
bad
parishioner
a
bunch
of
tare
in
the
field
of
god
a
scabby
sheep
in
the
flock
of
the
lord
taking
no
heed
of
his
religious
duties
reading
the
speaking
evil
of
priests
and
refusing
the
blessed
bread
he
was
the
scandal
of
the
godly
and
not
one
of
them
in
the
village
augured
any
good
of
him
never
did
a
publican
from
belleville
or
a
novice
of
freemasonry
proclaim
with
so
much
boldness
his
contempt
for
the
things
which
everybody
venerates
he
did
not
uncover
himself
in
presence
of
funerals
saying
he
did
not
want
to
bow
to
the
dead
he
called
the
church
the
priests
bank
the
altar
a
parade
of
mountebanks
the
confessional
the
antechamber
to
the
brothel
that
man
will
perish
on
the
scaffold
the
former
curé
of
the
village
cried
out
one
day
in
righteous
indignation
how
had
he
come
by
this
hatred
vigorous
as
that
which
alcestis
demands
from
virtuous
souls
against
hypocrites
and
what
had
the
done
to
him
he
did
not
say
and
perhaps
he
would
have
been
embarrassed
to
say
there
are
certain
natures
which
will
love
at
any
price
there
are
others
on
the
contrary
which
need
to
hate
he
was
doubtless
one
of
the
latter
and
he
discharged
all
his
excess
of
gall
on
the
servants
of
jesus
they
are
criminals
he
cried
all
without
exception
from
the
first
to
the
last
hypocrisy
engenders
wickedness
it
is
a
sore
which
spreads
and
becomes
leprosy
everything
which
touches
it
catches
it
those
who
associate
with
hypocrites
become
hypocrites
and
then
scoundrels
slowly
but
surely
by
infection
that
is
the
logic
of
the
scab
it
is
not
necessary
to
dress
up
in
a
black
gown
and
to
swallow
god
in
public
to
make
a
perfect
priestling
it
is
enough
to
rub
against
the
priest
cap
look
at
the
sacristans
the
beadles
the
lackeys
of
the
bishop
palace
the
hirers
of
chairs
the
the
sellers
of
tapers
the
tradesmen
by
appointment
to
the
religious
houses
the
beggar
who
stretches
out
his
hand
to
you
at
the
door
and
the
man
who
hands
you
the
sprinkler
have
they
not
all
the
same
hypocritical
face
the
same
cunning
devoutly
sanctimonious
look
well
scratch
the
skins
of
the
godly
and
you
will
find
the
hide
of
the
scoundrel
an
honourable
man
and
brutally
frank
like
many
old
soldiers
he
had
kept
in
private
life
the
tone
and
ways
of
barracks
and
camps
as
he
said
himself
he
did
not
mince
the
truth
to
anybody
and
he
repeated
readily
without
understanding
it
the
saying
of
gonsalvo
of
cordova
the
great
captain
cloth
of
honour
should
be
coarsely
when
one
evening
on
returning
home
he
found
the
card
of
the
curé
he
nearly
fell
backwards
what
he
has
had
the
audacity
to
come
to
my
house
this
holy
water
merchant
they
have
not
told
him
then
what
i
am
good
heavens
i
cried
my
dear
captain
what
has
this
poor
man
done
to
you
to
me
nothing
at
all
i
do
know
him
he
is
part
of
the
holy
priesthood
that
is
enough
for
me
he
is
a
scoundrel
like
the
rest
but
it
is
not
enough
to
call
a
man
scoundrel
you
must
prove
that
he
is
do
trouble
me
about
your
proofs
do
you
suppose
i
am
going
to
rummage
into
this
gentleman
private
life
and
see
what
passes
in
his
alcove
no
indeed
i
have
no
desire
to
do
so
and
i
leave
that
care
to
my
cook
come
captain
you
admit
that
this
is
to
vilify
a
man
on
rather
slender
grounds
there
are
fagots
and
fagots
and
so
there
are
curés
and
curés
this
one
i
assure
you
is
an
excellent
fellow
it
may
be
so
but
as
i
have
no
desire
to
make
his
acquaintance
i
laugh
at
his
good
qualities
everybody
is
not
of
your
opinion
and
it
appears
that
all
the
women
are
distracted
about
him
another
reason
why
i
detest
him
women
usually
place
their
affections
very
badly
and
he
turns
the
heads
of
all
the
girls
that
is
good
oh
the
good
curé
he
reminds
me
of
the
one
at
djidjelly
when
i
was
a
officer
the
greatest
that
i
have
ever
known
the
kabyles
used
to
call
him
which
means
capable
of
the
thirteenth
labour
of
hercules
and
they
held
him
in
high
esteem
but
when
he
went
near
their
tents
they
used
to
make
all
the
women
go
inside
ah
that
was
a
famous
curé
i
wish
that
ours
resembled
him
and
that
he
would
get
a
child
out
of
all
the
girls
and
that
he
would
make
cuckolds
of
all
the
husbands
why
so
to
teach
these
idiots
to
let
their
wives
and
their
daughters
be
idle
and
dance
attendance
at
the
churches
and
relate
all
the
details
of
their
household
and
their
little
sins
to
these
bullies
as
to
their
i
grant
there
is
some
danger

the

is

handsome

is
no

of

had

did
with
her

made
her

the
worst

yes
yes

say
that
the

get
over

the
black
gown
bewitches

that
if
you
can
they
want
to
know
what
is
underneath
that
wicked
cassock
something
strange
mysterious
monstrous

enormities
and
besides
it
must
be
said
especially
and
above
all
forbidden
fruit
the
captain

hobby

could

paternal
love
is
egotistic
it
is
for

vanity

the

looks
for

if
he

himself
to
be
an
eagle
his
son
naturally
must
be
an

most
frequently
he
is

a
foolish
gosling

the
father
insists
on
finding
on
him
an
eagle

if
then
he
is
deceived
in
his
hopes
which
are
only
a
deduction

laugh

this

put
him

my

gone

than
going
into
and
coming
out
of
church
then
the
church
is
a
spectacle
like
another
there
are
chants
music
tapers
perfumes
flowers
the
which
comes
through
the
coloured
windows
without
speaking
of
the
fellows
covered
with
who
repeat
in
unknown
language
the
to
which
no
one
listens
it
is
enough
to
make
one
burst
with
laughing
and
if
i
had
not
my
cabbages
to
plant
i
would
go
myself
now
and
again
and
entertain
myself
at
these
masquerades
which
are
as
good
as
the
theatres
at
the
fair
and
to
complete
the
resemblance
it
only
costs
a
couple
of
sous
but
the
principal
person
of
the
troop
attracts
the
looks
and
the
danger
is
there
your
priestling
is
young
then
and
vigorous
strong
appetites
when
i
see
him
rambling
in
the
village
i
begin
to
say
good
people
the
cock
is
loose
take
care
of
your
hens
it
is
like
your
curé
of
djidjelly
i
am
easy
on
that
ground
the
black
cock
will
not
come
and
rub
his
wings
here
he
knows
now
that
he
has
mistaken
the
door
they
have
informed
him
regarding
me
and
he
will
not
be
so
rude
as
to
come
again
but
just
at
that
moment
the
servant
came
into
the
room
quite
scared
and
said
here
is
monsieur
le
curé
who
what
said
durand
and
turning
towards
me
shall
i
receive
him
well
we
shall
have
a
laugh
he
was
still
undecided
when
marcel
glided
into
the
room
xix
hard
words
i
will
speak
madame
with
the
liberty
of
a
soldier
who
knows
but
ill
how
to
varnish
the
truth
racine
the
old
soldier
upright
with
his
hand
leaning
on
the
back
of
his
let
the
priest
come
forward
with
all
the
agreeableness
of
a
mastiff
which
is
making
ready
to
bite
the
latter
bowed
gravely
and
although
he
felt
himself
to
be
in
hostile
quarters
took
the
seat
offered
him
with
an
easy
air
meanwhile
his
bearing
and
pleasant
look
produced
their
usual
effect
imbued
with
the
theories
of
the
army
which
of
all
surroundings
is
that
in
which
one
judges
most
by
the
appearance
where
a
good
carriage
is
the
first
condition
of
success
where
in
fact
they
salute
the
stripes
and
not
the
man
the
captain
was
in
presence
of
this
handsome
young
fellow
recalled
to
less
aggressive
sentiments
hang
it
he
said
to
himself
what
a
splendid
cuirassier
this
fellow
would
have
made
what
devil
of
an
idea
has
shoved
him
into
a
cassock
war
being
the
most
sublime
of
arts
as
maurice
de
saxe
remarked
there
are
few
old
officers
who
understand
how
a
man
can
choose
another
profession
by
inclination
i
come
monsieur
le
capitaine
said
marcel
to
pay
you
my
visit
as
pastor
although
perhaps
a
little
late
but
you
are
aware
doubtless
that
i
have
had
the
honour
of
knocking
once
already
at
your
door
you
should
not
have
troubled
yourself
my
dear
sir
and
you
should
adhere
to
that
i
belong
so
little
to
the
holy
flock
i
owe
myself
to
all
said
marcel
smiling
to
the
bad
sheep
i
mean
to
the
wandering
sheep
just
as
to
the
good
ones
to
watch
over
the
one
to
bring
back
and
cure
the
others
oh
oh
well
sir
shepherd
you
are
losing
your
time
finely
for
i
am
a
goat
there
will
be
more
joys
in
heaven
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
that
is
the
story
of
the
just
persons
that
you
are
going
to
tell
us
we
know
it
and
let
me
tell
you
it
is
not
encouraging
for
the
just
persons
the
curé
seeing
himself
on
dangerous
ground
hastened
to
leap
elsewhere
this
is
a
charming
little
house
captain
it
is
a
sweet
retreat
after
toilsome
and
glorious
years
for
you
have
had
numerous
campaigns
have
you
not
fifteen
years
in
africa
campaigns
thirty
years
service
two
wounds
one
of
them
received
at
rome
when
we
fought
for
that
old
bully
pius
ix
marcel
had
gone
astray
again
he
quickly
seized
hold
of
the
wounds
ah
two
wounds
and
are
they
still
painful
sometimes
when
the
weather
is
stormy
and
yours
mine
captain
but
i
have
none
i
have
not
had
like
you
the
honour
of
shedding
any
blood
for
our
holy
father
a
pretty
cuckoo
it
does
matter
you
may
have
got
a
wound
somewhere
else
where
enquired
marcel
simply
how
do
i
know
we
get
them
right
and
left
when
we
are
least
thinking
of
it
like
all
accidents
well
if
you
had
been
the
chaplain
of
my
regiment
you
would
have
had
a
famous
accident
he
was
a
right
worthy
apostle
he
wanted
to
teach
the
catechism
to
the
daughter
of
our
cantinière
a
bud
of
sixteen
and
the
little
one
put
so
much
ardour
into
the
study
that
the
holy
spirit
made
her
hatch
her
parents
beat
her
unmercifully
and
the
poor
girl
died
of
grief
our
hero
who
knew
how
to
get
himself
out
of
it
with
unction
as
white
as
snow
did
not
all
the
same
betake
himself
to
paradise
a
pretty
italian
gave
him
his
reckoning
and
the
game
finished
he
died
in
the
hospital
pulling
an
ugly
face
that
was
the
best
action
of
his
life
well
old
boy
what
do
you
say
to
that
i
have
not
exactly
understood
replied
marcel
trying
to
keep
his
countenance
you
are
very
hard
of
understanding
i
will
tell
you
another
story
and
i
will
be
clearer
i
see
what
you
want
the
dots
on
the
i
marcel
rose
up
alarmed
no
no
cried
durand
do
get
up
do
go
away
since
you
are
here
we
must
talk
a
little
stay
it
will
not
be
long
it
is
the
story
of
a
cousin
of
mine
or
rather
a
cousin
of
my
wife
another
of
your
confraternity
he
was
curate
or
deacon
or
canon
in
fact
i
do
know
what
rank
in
your
regiment
at
any
rate
a
bitter
hypocrite
you
will
see
under
pretence
of
relationship
he
used
to
pay
us
frequent
visits
you
can
think
if
that
suited
me
who
already
adored
the
cassock
besides
on
principle
i
detested
cousins
it
is
the
sore
of
households
gentlemen
you
must
avoid
it
like
the
plague
monsieur
le
curé
if
you
have
a
pretty
servant
beware
of
cousins
i
only
say
that
my
wife
used
to
say
to
me
what
has
this
poor
boy
done
to
you
that
you
receive
him
so
badly
are
you
jealous
of
him
ah
i
know
very
well
it
is
because
he
belongs
to
my
family
and
you
can
not
endure
my
poor
relations
so
to
have
peace
i
tolerated
my
cousin
he
convinced
that
little
presents
maintain
friendship
used
to
make
us
little
presents
there
were
tickets
for
sacred
concerts
lotteries
for
the
benefit
of
the
little
chinese
rosaries
blessed
by
the
pope
pebbles
from
jerusalem
nothing
wrong
so
far
my
wife
availed
herself
of
the
concert
tickets
the
rosaries
were
put
into
a
drawer
and
i
threw
the
pebbles
into
the
garden
but
soon
his
gifts
changed
their
character
he
brought
us
some
hairs
of
pancratius
a
tooth
of
alacoque
a
rag
which
had
wiped
something
or
other
off
anastasius
or
cunegunda
my
wife
clasped
her
hands
was
in
ecstasy
and
transported
with
joy
and
i
went
and
brought
up
my
dinner
i
foresaw
the
time
when
he
would
bring
us
extraordinary
things
a
louse
of
labre
a
testicle
of
origen
the
coccyx
of
antony
the
parts
of
gudule
or
the
prepuce
of
jesus
christ
the
curé
rose
again
i
see
that
my
presence
is
here
captain
pardon
my
having
disturbed
you
not
at
all
good
lord
not
at
all
sit
down
it
gives
me
extraordinary
pleasure
to
talk
to
you
besides
i
have
not
finished
the
story
of
my
cousin
sit
down
i
pray
you
i
resume
he
had
given
a
very
pretty
engraving
a
reproduction
of
a
picture
by
somebody
and
the
woman
taken
in
my
wife
had
had
it
framed
very
carefully
and
had
hung
it
up
in
our
bedroom
a
bad
sign
that
seemed
to
say
to
me
see
my
friend
imitate
jesus
one
day
returning
home
very
quietly
i
surprised
both
of
them
squeezed
one
against
the
other
holding
each
others
hand
looking
at
the
picture
with
emotion
i
took
the
little
cousin
by
the
shoulders
and
i
threw
him
out
of
doors
i
never
saw
him
again
do
you
understand
the
moral
yes
captain
i
understand
said
marcel
rising
again
and
this
time
fully
decided
to
go
away
but
the
door
opened
and
suzanne
showed
herself
on
the
threshold
xx
kicks
i
should
have
wished
mischievously
to
put
him
in
the
wrong
and
that
a
thoughtless
or
insulting
word
on
his
part
should
serve
as
a
justification
for
the
insult
which
i
meditated
a
de
vigny
et
grandeur
she
had
on
her
dress
of
black
which
made
the
whiteness
of
her
complexion
more
dazzling
and
imparted
something
grave
and
serious
to
her
beauty
she
was
hardly
eighteen
and
already
by
the
harmonious
outlines
of
her
bust
by
the
undulating
movements
of
her
hips
and
above
all
by
the
flash
of
her
great
dark
eyes
one
foresaw
in
this
young
girl
still
a
child
the
woman
of
a
daughter
of
eve
of
our
modern
civilization
forward
precocious
charming
she
was
one
of
those
the
sight
alone
of
whom
is
the
most
radiant
and
the
most
dangerous
of
spectacles
and
who
like
others
distilling
holiness
and
blessings
from
heaven
shed
around
them
a
perfume
of
love
the
bright
fire
of
their
heart
shines
out
in
their
look
it
reveals
itself
in
the
sound
of
their
voice
in
their
gestures
and
in
their
walk
everything
in
them
is
soft
trembling
passionate
sweet
creatures
who
see
only
one
goal
in
life
love
and
when
the
goal
is
missed
death
there
are
women
who
are
but
half
women
they
are
quickly
recognized
vulgar
and
awkward
they
hide
under
their
ungraceful
petticoats
the
instincts
of
man
and
masculinity
is
displayed
up
to
their
corsage
they
form
the
fantastical
cohort
of
learned
women
of
the
disciples
of
stuart
mill
and
rivals
of
miss
taylor
hybrid
natures
which
may
possess
a
heart
of
gold
and
a
manly
soul
but
are
incapable
of
being
the
joy
of
the
hearth
others
are
women
to
the
tips
of
their
rosy
nails
to
the
root
of
their
abundant
hair
women
above
all
by
their
faults
that
is
to
say
their
weaknesses
and
this
weakness
is
one
of
their
attractions
impressionable
and
easily
led
they
become
according
to
the
surroundings
which
hold
them
and
the
destiny
which
urges
them
heroines
or
saints
courtesans
or
nuns
but
invariably
martyrs
of
that
blind
despot
their
heart
they
are
magdalene
or
theresa
madame
de
guyon
or
heloïse
the
nun
in
love
with
jesus
or
the
light
girl
in
love
with
the
in
a
second
the
priest
had
understood
this
sweet
nature
or
rather
he
had
felt
it
and
his
quivering
nostrils
inhaled
the
keen
perfume
of
pleasure
while
his
look
was
lost
in
ecstasy
it
was
but
a
flash
but
if
beneath
the
watchful
eye
of
the
captain
it
appeared
impossible
the
young
girl
could
read
the
dumb
language
which
every
woman
understands
she
came
forward
blushing
this
is
my
daughter
said
the
captain
i
believe
said
the
curé
with
a
bow
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
mademoiselle
several
times
already
in
our
modest
church
and
you
concluded
therefore
that
my
daughter
was
going
to
increase
the
blessed
flock
do
be
misled
comrade
suzanne
cast
a
look
of
reproach
upon
her
father
what
said
marcel
hurt
must
not
mademoiselle
follow
her
religion
work
out
her
salvation
her
salvation
there
is
a
word
which
always
makes
me
laugh
it
reminds
me
of
my
colonel
wife
who
when
her
husband
gave
orders
for
a
review
and
parade
for
sunday
said
my
dear
you
want
then
to
deprive
the
poor
soldiers
of
the
holy
mass
ought
they
not
to
work
out
their
salvation
a
magnificent
creature
sir
but
too
much
inclined
to
the
cassock
her
husband
however
had
nothing
to
complain
of
for
one
fine
morning
he
picked
up
the
stars
of
his
epaulets
in
some
sacristy
or
other
what
have
you
come
for
my
child
nothing
papa
i
knew
monsieur
le
curé
was
there
and
i
came
in
i
was
having
a
little
edifying
conversation
with
monsieur
and
you
have
interrupted
us
but
we
can
talk
of
something
else
you
hold
the
first
rank
now
gentlemen
continued
the
captain
i
must
do
you
that
justice
and
as
times
go
it
is
better
to
be
the
son
of
a
bishop
than
of
a
general
i
myself
if
i
had
only
had
some
high
influential
canon
for
my
father
should
have
reached
the
highest
offices
come
you
seem
to
me
to
be
a
good
fellow
and
i
want
to
give
you
a
word
of
advice
if
papa
is
a
bishop
make
use
of
him
and
do
stagnate
in
this
village
you
will
get
no
good
there
i
tell
you
so
on
my
word
of
honour
i
suppose
that
with
you
promotion
is
as
it
is
with
us
the
cup
of
humiliation
is
full
said
marcel
to
himself
nevertheless
he
answered
i
do
understand
exactly
what
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
by
that
that
promotion
is
a
lottery
from
which
they
begin
by
withdrawing
all
the
big
numbers
to
distribute
them
to
monsieur
cretinard
whose
papa
is
a
millionaire
to
monsieur
tartuffe
whose
papa
is
a
jesuit
or
to
a
marquis
de
carabas
whose
mamma
has
the
good
graces
of
my
lord
the
bishop
and
they
make
the
poor
devils
draw
from
the
rest
it
is
so
in
the
army
and
with
you
among
the
clergy
sir
promotion
is
generally
given
to
merit
i
do
believe
it
for
if
it
were
so
you
would
be
a
bishop
at
least
do
blush
it
is
the
general
report
captain
no
false
modesty
i
hear
your
virtues
praised
everywhere
there
is
a
chorus
of
praises
from
every
quarter
my
friend
here
was
just
declaring
to
me
that
all
the
women
are
wild
about
you
sir
cried
the
curé
blushing
up
to
his
ears
and
not
daring
to
raise
his
eyes
to
suzanne
who
sat
in
a
corner
convulsively
turning
over
the
leaves
of
an
album
do
protest
we
know
that
true
merit
is
modest
besides
i
was
by
way
of
asking
myself
if
i
should
not
beg
you
to
complete
my
education
you
are
making
pleasant
jokes
captain
and
i
ask
your
pardon
for
not
being
able
to
rise
to
the
level
of
these
witticisms
i
see
that
my
visit
has
been
unseasonable
it
only
remains
for
me
to
make
my
excuses
and
to
say
to
mademoiselle
how
pained
i
am
to
have
made
her
acquaintance
under
such
unfavourable
auspices
but
i
hope
stop
that
monsieur
le
curé
interrupted
durand
in
a
curt
tone
marcel
made
a
low
bow
but
as
he
withdraw
he
caught
an
appealing
look
from
suzanne
xxi
the
past
look
not
upon
the
past
with
grief
it
will
not
come
back
wisely
improve
the
present
it
is
thine
and
go
onwards
fearlessly
and
with
a
strong
heart
towards
the
mysterious
future
longfellow
marcel
returned
home
exceedingly
indignant
although
he
had
not
expected
an
reception
from
the
old
captain
whose
irascible
character
and
surly
ways
were
known
to
all
he
did
not
think
that
he
would
have
carried
so
far
his
disregard
of
the
most
elementary
propriety
it
serves
me
right
he
said
to
himself
what
business
had
i
there
nevertheless
on
reflection
i
have
lost
nothing
my
reception
by
this
old
dotard
has
taken
away
for
ever
my
wish
to
go
back
there
and
who
knows
what
might
have
happened
if
i
had
had
free
admission
to
that
house
if
i
had
met
a
friendly
face
and
a
kindly
welcome
oh
fool
i
have
found
all
that
in
the
sweet
look
of
his
adorable
daughter
that
appealing
look
which
seemed
to
implore
my
indulgence
and
pardon
for
the
malevolent
words
of
that
soldier
come
think
no
more
of
it
drive
back
to
the
lowest
depths
those
foolish
thoughts
which
excite
the
brain
all
that
he
does
god
does
well
i
was
on
the
brink
of
the
abyss
one
step
more
and
i
should
have
rolled
to
the
bottom
let
me
stop
then
there
is
still
time
let
me
forget
forget
forget
better
still
i
will
write
and
ask
to
be
changed
could
i
forget
her
if
i
were
to
meet
again
that
burning
look
which
pursues
me
to
the
steps
of
the
altar
and
troubles
me
to
the
bottom
of
my
soul
he
wrote
in
fact
and
began
his
letter
ten
times
afresh
what
could
he
say
what
reason
could
he
bring
he
had
filled
this
cure
for
scarcely
six
months
what
pretext
could
he
raise
before
his
superiors
and
how
would
any
complaint
from
him
be
received
at
the
palace
night
came
he
felt
himself
oppressed
by
a
vague
and
indefinable
grief
then
little
by
little
the
present
vanished
his
infancy
rose
up
before
him
he
saw
it
again
as
in
a
glass
smiling
simple
pure
and
he
forgot
himself
in
these
sweet
memories
in
proportion
as
we
advance
in
life
we
are
attached
to
the
things
of
the
past
it
clothes
itself
then
with
those
brilliant
colours
with
which
we
love
to
invest
what
we
have
lost
youthful
years
bright
with
poetry
and
sunlight
come
and
gild
the
gloomy
and
prosaic
nooks
of
ripened
age
the
twilight
of
the
eternal
night
the
young
man
full
of
illusions
and
dreams
pursues
his
road
without
casting
a
look
backwards
what
matters
indeed
the
past
to
him
he
expects
nothing
but
from
the
future
proud
at
having
escaped
from
infancy
at
arriving
at
the
age
of
man
at
flying
on
his
wings
he
pities
the
years
when
he
was
small
and
weak
ignorant
and
credulous
but
when
he
has
met
with
obstacles
and
ruts
on
that
road
which
appeared
to
him
so
wide
and
so
fair
when
he
has
torn
his
heart
with
the
first
briars
of
life
when
his
thought
has
ripened
beneath
the
sun
of
passions
and
his
soul
stripped
of
its
illusions
feels
all
chilly
and
bare
amidst
the
ice
of
reality
then
he
returns
to
the
joys
of
infancy
he
warms
himself
again
with
the
memory
of
his
mother
and
sits
once
again
in
the
pleasant
corner
of
the
family
on
the
little
stool
of
his
childhood
marcel
saw
himself
again
at
the
little
seminary
of
on
the
benches
all
blackened
with
ink
of
the
studying
with
ardour
the
or
the
beneath
the
paternal
eye
of
father
martin
a
father
aged
a
deacon
with
curly
hair
as
timid
as
a
maid
then
he
ran
in
the
long
corridors
or
in
the
great
square
court
lined
with
galleries
shaded
by
the
chapel
he
remembered
his
joy
when
he
had
slipped
on
some
excuse
into
the
seniors
garden
ah
there
is
little
marcel
come
here
you
brat
and
everyone
wished
to
give
him
a
caress
then
the
first
time
when
he
was
called
to
the
honour
of
serving
the
mass
he
had
thought
of
it
a
week
beforehand
full
of
emotion
and
fear
at
length
the
day
has
come
he
is
dressed
in
the
white
surplice
wearing
on
his
head
the
red
cap
he
would
have
wished
the
whole
world
to
see
him
but
the
pupils
alone
were
present
and
that
diminished
his
happiness
father
barbelin
the
censor
a
severe
but
just
man
officiated
he
trembled
in
every
limb
as
he
responded
the
sacramental
verses
to
this
formidable
functionary
that
was
a
great
business
his
little
comrades
called
him
in
a
whisper
from
behind
marcel
marcel
and
laughed
and
nudged
each
other
while
the
elder
ones
their
nose
in
their
book
with
sanctimonious
face
and
ecstatic
look
were
wrapt
in
god
then
his
success
his
entrance
to
the
great
seminary
at
nancy
his
first
sermon
in
the
chapel
his
voice
trembled
at
the
commencement
but
little
by
little
growing
stronger
taking
courage
inspired
by
the
sacred
text
he
forgot
everything
and
the
superior
old
father
richard
who
watched
him
with
his
little
bright
cunning
eyes
and
the
unmoved
professors
and
his
watchful
jeering
and
scoffing
at
first
then
at
last
astonished
and
jealous
there
is
the
stuff
of
an
orator
in
him
the
professor
of
sacred
eloquence
had
said
we
must
push
this
lad
forward
he
is
full
of
talent
and
virtue
the
superior
had
replied
he
will
get
on
he
is
our
chosen
vessel
and
the
same
day
he
had
dined
at
the
table
and
they
had
spoken
of
him
to
monseigneur
he
had
in
fact
been
pushed
forward
and
with
his
talents
his
learning
his
virtues
and
his
eloquence
he
had
come
to
teaching
the
catechism
to
the
little
peasants
of
althausen
althausen
that
was
the
blow
of
the
hammer
which
recalled
him
to
reality
he
found
himself
again
the
poor
village
curé
and
he
began
to
laugh
poor
fool
he
cried
i
shall
never
be
but
a
common
imbecile
is
not
my
way
all
traced
out
i
must
continue
my
career
and
let
myself
go
with
the
current
of
life
is
it
then
so
hard
why
delude
myself
with
phantoms
i
will
try
to
slay
the
muttering
passions
to
drive
away
the
fits
of
ambition
which
rise
to
my
brain
and
perhaps
by
dint
of
subduing
all
that
is
rebellious
in
me
i
shall
come
to
follow
piously
the
line
marked
out
by
my
superiors
i
will
watch
patiently
amidst
my
flock
by
the
corner
of
my
fire
among
the
fathers
and
my
weariness
weariness
that
cold
demon
with
the
gloomy
eye
but
i
will
remain
chaste
and
after
a
life
filled
with
little
nothingnesses
and
little
works
i
shall
pass
away
in
peace
in
the
bosom
of
the
lord
and
there
is
my
life
nothing
else
to
choose
no
turning
aside
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
i
must
remain
a
martyr
a
martyr
to
my
duty
or
an
apostate
and
infamous
renegade
the
triumph
or
the
shame
and
as
he
just
uttered
these
words
with
bitterness
a
soft
voice
answered
like
an
echo
the
shame
the
curé
started
and
raised
his
head
his
lamp
was
out
and
the
dying
embers
on
the
hearth
cast
only
a
feeble
light
into
the
room
he
distinguished
however
a
few
steps
from
him
the
outline
of
a
form
who
is
there
he
cried
with
a
sort
of
terror
the
shadowy
outline
stood
forth
more
clearly
he
recognized
his
servant
why
the
shame
she
said
xxii
the
servant
i
have
already
said
that
dame
jacinthe
although
little
superannuated
had
still
kept
her
bloom
it
is
true
that
she
spared
nothing
to
preserve
it
besides
taking
a
clyster
every
day
she
swallowed
some
excellent
jelly
during
the
day
and
on
going
to
bed
le
sage
she
looked
at
him
fixedly
with
burning
feverish
eyes
she
was
a
lusty
lass
already
arrived
at
the
age
of
discretion
as
le
sage
says
that
is
to
say
she
had
passed
her
fortieth
year
the
canonical
period
for
the
servants
of
curés
but
was
fair
and
fresh
still
in
spite
of
some
wrinkles
and
her
hair
growing
gray
she
possessed
that
modest
and
appetizing
plumpness
somewhat
rare
among
mature
virgins
the
sign
of
a
quiet
conscience
a
good
digestion
and
feelings
satisfied
what
pious
souls
call
holiness
exuded
from
every
pore
eyes
chaste
deportment
gentle
movements
she
did
not
walk
she
glided
over
the
ground
as
if
she
already
felt
the
wings
of
seraphim
hanging
on
her
shoulders
she
did
not
speak
she
murmured
unctuous
words
with
a
soft
low
mysterious
voice
like
a
prayer
when
she
said
would
monsieur
le
curé
he
pleased
to
come
to
breakfast
perhaps
monsieur
le
curé
could
eat
a
boiled
egg
or
ah
the
sermon
which
monsieur
le
curé
has
been
pleased
to
give
has
gone
to
my
heart
it
was
in
the
same
tone
as
she
would
say
of
god
which
takest
away
the
sins
of
the
and
one
was
tempted
to
answer
and
she
wiped
her
moist
eyelid
and
cast
on
her
master
her
veiled
long
silent
look
she
said
so
well
my
duty
i
wish
to
do
my
duty
that
one
felt
filled
with
admiration
for
this
holy
maid
oh
divine
modesty
perfume
of
woman
sweet
enchantment
which
gently
penetrates
the
heart
of
man
ready
always
to
unfold
besides
what
hearts
had
unfolded
for
her
what
ravages
had
been
caused
by
her
austere
deportment
and
her
substantial
charms
more
than
one
buxom
village
lad
had
made
warm
proposals
with
honourable
intentions
and
the
gallant
corporal
of
gendarmes
had
tried
on
several
occasions
to
enter
upon
this
delicate
subject
with
her
but
she
had
willed
to
remain
a
maid
and
virtuous
and
vowed
herself
body
and
soul
to
the
service
of
the
church
to
the
glory
of
god
and
the
fortune
of
her
pastor
she
approached
the
hearth
with
slow
steps
blew
on
the
embers
relighted
the
lamp
and
placing
it
so
as
to
throw
the
light
on
her
master
face
she
said
to
him
anxiously
you
are
in
pain
are
you
not
you
were
there
then
said
the
curé
dissatisfied
yes
she
answered
him
with
the
affectionate
tone
of
a
mother
i
was
there
pardon
me
i
was
going
to
bed
and
i
heard
you
talking
aloud
there
was
no
light
i
feared
you
were
ill
and
i
ventured
to
come
in
and
you
have
heard
i
have
heard
that
you
were
not
happy
that
is
all
no
one
is
happy
in
this
world
veronica
yes
we
are
so
only
in
the
other
i
know
that
and
yet
happiness
is
so
easy
the
curé
put
his
head
between
his
hands
without
replying
the
servant
went
on
can
it
be
that
i
your
servant
a
poor
ignorant
village
girl
should
say
that
to
you
monsieur
le
curé
what
veronica
but
what
matters
our
condition
on
earth
we
are
in
a
state
of
transition
holy
mary
she
too
was
a
poor
servant
and
now
she
is
far
above
a
queen
without
doubt
said
the
curé
we
must
then
despise
nobody
under
the
most
humble
appearance
god
often
conceals
his
most
faithful
servants
most
certainly
but
what
are
you
driving
at
at
this
monsieur
le
curé
that
we
must
be
good
and
indulgent
to
everybody
that
the
great
sometimes
have
need
of
the
little
and
that
when
we
are
able
to
render
a
service
to
our
neighbour
we
must
do
it
without
hesitation
it
is
jesus
who
commands
it
veronica
but
explain
yourself
i
pray
well
yes
i
will
speak
she
replied
for
i
am
pained
to
see
you
thus
and
the
more
so
as
it
is
certainly
allowed
me
to
tell
you
so
me
who
am
destined
please
god
to
live
with
you
i
have
only
known
you
since
you
were
our
curé
but
you
have
been
so
good
to
me
that
i
love
you
like
a
sister
i
was
all
alone
here
like
a
poor
forsaken
creature
after
the
death
of
my
old
master
the
abbé
fortin
may
god
keep
his
soul
and
you
consented
to
keep
me
when
taking
the
parsonage
it
is
good
of
you
for
you
might
have
brought
with
you
your
former
servant
or
again
some
niece
as
many
do
i
have
no
niece
veronica
a
niece
or
a
sister
or
a
relation
after
all
you
have
kept
me
although
you
could
have
found
a
better
than
myself
oh
very
easily
i
know
and
i
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
yes
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
but
could
you
have
found
one
more
devoted
more
discreet
i
believe
not
as
much
perhaps
but
more
i
believe
not
ah
i
tell
you
here
monsieur
le
curé
you
can
do
everything
you
want
nobody
shall
ever
know
anything
of
it
the
curé
looked
at
his
servant
with
amazement
what
do
you
mean
by
that
veronica
he
asked
in
a
stern
voice
oh
nothing
i
mean
nothing
i
mean
that
you
can
have
entire
confidence
in
your
poor
servant
i
thank
you
veronica
but
i
do
know
what
you
mean
i
explain
myself
badly
doubtless
monsieur
le
curé
ah
pardon
me
i
was
forgetting
here
there
is
a
letter
which
i
have
just
found
and
which
has
been
slipped
under
the
door
at
night
he
looked
at
the
address
it
was
an
elegant
and
bold
hand
the
hand
of
a
woman
xxiii
the
letter
the
beauty
then
to
end
this
war
offers
but
a
single
way
which
we
can
hardly
guess
imbert
a
sweet
perfume
was
exhaled
from
it
he
opened
it
with
a
trembling
hand
that
strange
intuition
of
the
heart
which
is
named
presentiment
told
him
that
it
came
from
suzanne
pale
with
emotion
he
read
monsieur
i
do
not
wish
the
day
to
pass
without
coming
to
ask
your
pardon
for
my
father
conduct
towards
you
and
assure
you
that
he
does
not
think
a
single
one
of
his
wicked
words
do
not
keep
i
pray
an
evil
memory
of
me
and
believe
that
i
should
he
grieved
if
a
single
doubt
were
to
remain
in
your
mind
as
to
the
sympathy
and
respect
which
you
inspire
in
suzanne
durand
i
have
much
need
of
your
counsels
marcel
full
of
a
delicious
trouble
read
and
this
letter
he
did
not
take
careful
note
of
his
sensations
but
he
felt
an
ineffable
joy
overflow
his
heart
and
at
the
same
time
a
vague
anxiety
his
servant
voice
recalled
him
to
himself
doubtless
it
is
a
sick
person
who
asks
for
religious
aid
she
said
was
there
a
slight
irony
in
that
question
the
priest
thought
he
saw
it
he
called
out
sharply
you
are
still
there
veronica
who
has
called
you
i
do
want
you
any
longer
pardon
me
monsieuur
le
curé
she
answered
humbly
and
softly
i
was
waiting
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
were
going
out
visit
this
sick
and
that
then
i
could
be
useful
to
you
in
some
way
you
can
not
be
useful
to
me
in
any
way
veronica
but
truly
you
astonish
me
what
have
you
then
to
say
to
me
come
explain
yourself
at
once
no
monsieur
le
curé
there
is
midnight
striking
it
is
time
to
repose
i
wish
you
sir
veronica
what
a
strange
woman
said
marcel
to
himself
what
can
she
want
with
me
one
would
say
that
she
had
a
secret
to
confide
to
me
and
that
she
does
not
dare
could
she
have
any
suspicion
no
it
is
impossible
how
could
she
know
what
i
want
to
hide
from
myself
she
has
caught
two
or
three
words
perhaps
but
what
could
she
understand
and
what
have
i
let
drop
to
compromise
me
she
has
evidently
heard
others
for
she
was
here
before
me
and
these
old
walls
have
been
witnesses
i
am
sure
of
many
groanings
of
the
soul
let
us
be
cautious
nevertheless
and
repress
within
ourselves
the
thoughts
which
would
come
forth
a
wise
precept
it
was
a
precept
of
my
master
of
rhetoric
yes
let
us
be
cautious
in
spite
of
this
appearance
of
devotion
who
would
trust
to
such
marks
of
affection
the
servant
enemy
is
his
master
and
i
clearly
see
that
independently
of
my
dignity
i
must
not
make
the
least
false
step
what
torments
i
should
reserve
to
myself
for
the
future
and
this
letter
of
suzanne
the
adorable
and
lovely
suzanne
what
an
emotion
suddenly
seized
me
at
the
sight
of
that
unknown
handwriting
which
i
had
a
presentiment
was
here
oh
what
a
strange
mystery
is
man
heart
i
a
priest
with
a
nature
said
to
be
energetic
and
strong
i
trembled
and
was
affected
like
a
child
because
it
has
pleased
a
little
to
write
me
a
couple
of
lines
in
order
to
excuse
her
father
rudeness
what
is
more
natural
than
such
conduct
is
it
not
the
act
of
a
girl
and
yet
already
my
foolish
brain
is
beating
the
country
and
travelling
into
the
land
of
fancies
of
abominable
fancies
she
asks
me
for
counsel
doubtless
i
will
give
it
her
is
it
not
my
duty

as

where
but
when
can
i
see

and
he
went
very
thoughtfully
to
bed
with
his
head
full
of
dreams
xxiv
the
first
meeting
ah
let
him
my
child
ah
let
him
proceed
when
i
was
a
curate
i
did
much
the
same
anonymous
chant
du
the
first
person
he
saw
the
next
day
at
morning
mass
was
suzanne
durand
she
had
not
yet
come
to
these
low
masses
which
are
affected
usually
by
the
devout
because
the
church
is
then
more
empty
and
they
feel
themselves
more
alone
with
god
or
with
the
priest
therefore
the
curé
was
deeply
affected
by
this
pious
eagerness
it
is
doubtful
whether
on
that
day
his
prayers
reached
the
throne
of
the
eternal
for
he
brought
but
little
fervour
to
the
holy
sacrifice
a
good
woman
who
had
given
twenty
sous
to
buy
a
place
in
the
firmament
for
her
defunct
spouse
was
quite
scandalized
to
remark
that
the
curé
was
eating
in
a
heedless
manner
the
wafer
which
for
nearly
years
serves
as
a
lodging
for
christ
his
words
rose
with
the
incense
to
the
arches
of
the
old
church
but
his
soul
remained
below
fluttering
round
that
fair
young
girl
as
if
to
envelop
her
with
embraces
when
he
had
dismissed
the
faithful
with
the
sacramental
words
missa
he
felt
a
momentary
confusion
and
he
felt
his
knees
tremble
he
was
afraid
of
himself
for
he
saw
the
captain
daughter
rise
from
her
seat
and
slowly
make
her
way
to
the
confessional
what
it
was
perfectly
true
then
she
had
asked
for
his
counsel
and
while
he
the
priest
was
hesitating
and
seeking
where
he
could
converse
with
her
without
exposing
himself
to
the
brutal
invective
of
the
father
or
the
senseless
scandals
of
the
village
this
simple
girl
had
found
without
any
aid
from
him
the
safest
spot
the
sanctuary
of
which
he
had
inwardly
dreamed
he
was
then
about
to
listen
all
alone
to
the
divine
accents
of
that
charming
mouth
to
see
her
kneeling
before
him
her
face
wreathed
with
a
modest
blush
before
him
who
had
wished
to
kiss
her
oh
god
supreme
who
could
depict
his
transports
his
emotion
the
thrill
which
ran
through
all
his
frame
she
she
so
near
to
him
so
near
that
her
sweet
breath
caresses
his
face
like
a
breeze
come
from
heaven
he
felt
wild
with
joy
but
she
also
is
affected
she
also
trembles
and
beneath
her
palpitating
breast
he
seems
to
hear
the
beatings
of
her
heart
what
passed
what
avowal
did
this
maiden
of
ardent
feeling
make
to
this
man
there
is
one
of
those
mysteries
which
remain
for
ever
buried
between
priest
and
woman
between
penitent
and
confessor
what
they
said
to
one
another
no
one
knows
but
from
that
confessional
into
which
he
entered
pensive
wavering
it
is
true
but
still
contending
he
went
out
with
his
face
radiant
and
his
heart
intoxicated
with
love
xxv
love
all
loves
around
us
all
around
is
heard
hard
by
the
warbler
quivering
kiss
that
voiceless
song
of
flowers
which
the
lark
by
love
distracted
to
his
mate
translates
emile
dario
he
returned
to
the
parsonage
with
a
light
step
hearing
the
birds
singing
in
the
the
same
joyous
song
which
his
own
heart
was
singing
he
breakfasted
with
a
good
appetite
smiled
at
his
servant
and
gave
pleasant
answers
to
her
questions
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
new
world
was
opening
new
ideas
sprang
up
in
him
and
he
discovered
sensations
till
then
unknown
he
felt
better
life
smiled
upon
him
and
all
the
things
of
life
the
past
had
altogether
vanished
the
present
was
radiant
the
future
was
laden
with
rosy
dreams
that
same
morning
he
had
risen
as
usual
with
no
settled
wish
aimless
and
hopeless
till
then
he
had
acted
like
a
machine
hardly
knowing
whither
he
went
following
his
road
by
chance
walking
onwards
in
the
line
which
had
been
traced
out
for
him
with
no
relish
full
of
weariness
and
sadness
what
was
he
expecting
then
nothing
he
was
clinging
to
the
fragments
of
his
beliefs
he
remained
hanging
there
not
daring
to
stir
to
think
or
to
turn
for
fear
of
rolling
to
the
bottom
of
some
unknown
abyss

said
he
experienced
a

had
had
a

he
was
one
of

delicate

timid
souls
with

some
way
turned
upon
themselves
which
are
terrified
at

with

xxvi
of
young
girls
in
general
you
tell
me
madame
that
this
description
is
neither
in
the
taste
of
ovid
nor
that
of
quinault
i
agree
my
dear
but
i
am
not
in
a
humour
to
say
soft
things
voltaire
the
great
fault
in
my
opinion
both
of
the
writer
and
of
the
poet
is
to
idealize
woman
too
much
and
especially
the
young
girl
on
the
stage
just
as
in
the
novel
the
heroines
are
placed
on
a
sort
of
pedestal
where
they
receive
haughtily
the
incense
and
homage
of
poor
mankind
they
are
perfect
beings
of
superior
essence
gifted
with
all
the
beauties
and
all
the
virtues
whose
white
robes
of
innocence
never
receive
amidst
all
the
impurities
of
our
social
state
the
slightest
splash
why
then
raise
thus
upon
a
pedestal
of
parian
marble
these
statues
of
clay
why
place
reverentially
beneath
a
tabernacle
of
gold
these
pasteboard
divinities
good
heavens
women
are
women
that
is
to
say
the
females
of
man
nothing
more
they
are
above
all
what
men
make
them
and
as
we
are
generally
vicious
and
spoilt
since
from
the
most
tender
age
we
take
care
to
defile
ourselves
in
the
street
in
the
workshop
or
on
the
as
the
atmosphere
we
breathe
is
corrupt
we
have
no
claim
to
believe
that
our
wives
our
sisters
and
our
daughters
can
remain
unspotted
by
our
touch
and
that
this
same
atmosphere
which
they
breathe
will
purify
itself
in
passing
through
their
chaste
nostrils
if
then
the
woman
is
not
worse
than
we
as
some
assert
assuredly
she
is
no
better
and
how
could
they
be
better
who
are
our
pupils
and
when
the
share
we
have
given
them
in
society
is
so
slight
and
so
strangely
ordered
that
if
they
can
not
by
means
of
supreme
efforts
expand
and
grow
in
it
morally
and
intellectually
every
latitude
is
allowed
them
on
the
other
hand
to
corrupt
themselves
in
it
beyond
measure
and
to
fall
lower
than
the
man
into
the
lowest
depths
fools
said
machiavelli
you
sow
hemlock
and
pretend
you
see
ears
of
corn
growing
ripe
why
then
idealize
and
make
a
divinity
of
this
creature
when
we
know
that
the
education
she
ordinarily
receives
takes
away
from
her
little
by
little
all
which
remains
attractive
divine
and
ideal
certainly
a
chaste
and
simple
young
girl
fair
and
fresh
as
a
spring
morning
sweet
as
the
perfume
of
the
violet
and
whose
mind
and
body
alike
are
as
pure
as
the
petals
of
a
lily
is
the
most
heavenly
and
the
most
adorable
thing
in
the
world
but
outside
the
pages
of
your
novel
how
many
of
them
have
you
met
in
the
world
i
have
often
heard
the
modest
virtues
of
the
middle
classes
extolled
and
it
is
from
such
surroundings
that
the
novelist
of
most
frequently
draws
his
feminine
ideal
it
is
among
the
middle
classes
indeed
that
all
the
qualifications
seem
to
unite
at
first
it
is
the
intermediate
condition
the
most
happy
of
all
as
the
excellent
monsieur
daru
said
in
since
it
is
only
disinherited
of
the
highest
favours
of
fortune
and
the
social
and
intellectual
advantages
of
it
are
accessible
to
a
reasonable
ambition
but
they
evidently
benefit
very
little
by
their
advantages
for
i
and
you
also
have
always
found
them
coquettish
ignorant
frivolous
and
vain
bringing
up
their
children
very
badly
but
in
revenge
generally
deceiving
their
husbands
very
well
in
households
bickering
among
fashionable
people
adultery
in
fashionable
households
either
one
or
the
other
and
sometimes
both
and
how
could
it
be
otherwise
the
daughters
of
devout
and
consequently
and
ignorant
mothers
of
sceptical
and
libertine
fathers
they
spend
five
or
six
years
at
school
where
they
consummate
the
loss
of
what
may
have
escaped
the
baneful
example
of
their
family
they
have
taken
from
their
mother
foolish
vanity
ridiculous
prejudices
the
art
of
lying
from
their
father
scepticism
and
an
elastic
conscience
perhaps
they
will
preserve
their
virtue
and
modesty
the
pernicious
contacts
of
the
school
soon
carry
them
away
they
still
have
a
blush
on
their
face
a
eye
a
timid
bearing
but
their
affected
timidity
is
the
token
of
their
knowledge
of
and
like
eve
if
they
have
not
yet
tasted
of
the
forbidden
fruit
they
burn
to
taste
it
for
their
thought
is
sullied
their
imagination
is
vagrant
and
at
the
bottom
of
their
soul
there
is
a
germ
of
corruption
they
leave
the
but
chaste
never
let
us
then
represent
the
world
as
it
la
women
such
as
they
are
and
not
such
as
they
ought
to
be
let
us
call
things
by
their
names
and
when
there
is
moral
deformity
somewhere
let
us
show
that
deformity
when
we
make
wonders
of
the
heroines
of
a
novel
possessing
the
charms
of
the
and
the
virtues
of
the
seven
sages
of
greece
who
when
they
fall
fall
in
spite
of
themselves
impelled
by
a
fatal
concurrence
of
circumstances
but
with
so
much
candour
and
innocence
that
we
can
not
do
otherwise
than
pardon
their
fall
and
even
fail
to
comprehend
that
they
have
fallen
we
are
completely
amazed
when
we
descend
from
this
imaginary
world
to
enter
the
world
of
reality
the
idealization
of
woman
has
therefore
besides
other
faults
that
of
causing
as
to
take
a
dislike
to
our
ordinary
companions
how
indeed
after
being
present
at
the
devotion
of
sophonisba
at
the
suicide
of
the
chaste
lucretia
at
the
display
of
the
virtues
of
mademoiselle
agnes
and
at
that
of
the
form
of
venus
at
the
bath
can
we
contemplate
with
ravished
eye
the
wife
no
less
plain
than
lawful
who
is
sitting
with
sullen
air
at
our
who
has
no
other
care
than
that
of
her
person
no
other
moral
capital
than
a
round
enough
sum
of
prejudices
and
follies
and
whose
charms
finally
resemble
more
those
of
a
hottentot
venus
than
those
of
venus
aphrodite
the
picture
of
virtues
is
an
excellent
thing
but
still
it
is
necessary
that
these
virtues
should
exist
we
must
not
enunciate
an
idea
simply
because
it
is
moral
but
because
it
is
true
plato
sed
magis
amica
that
is
why
i
shall
not
depict
the
little
person
whom
i
am
going
to
make
better
known
to
you
as
a
model
of
virtue
she
is
an
inquisitive
girl
she
is
vehement
she
has
been
brought
up
in
an
atmosphere
where
depravity
is
more
generally
inhaled
than
holiness
i
should
then
be
badly
advised
in
presenting
you
with
an
angel
of
candour
and
wisdom
an
angel
she
is
at
that
age
indeed
at
which
foolish
men
call
women
angels
before
they
are
wed
they
are
angels
so
gentle
but
quickly
they
change
to
vulgarian
scolds
who
truly
make
hell
of
their
homes

this
is
what
i
have
most
surely
gathered
at
this
school
and
is
called
a
brilliant
education
sardou
but
she
was
a
ravishing
demon
this
child
and
more
than
one
saint
might
have
damned
himself
for
her
black
eyes
those
deep
limpid
eyes
which
let
one
read
to
her
soul
and
there
one
paused
perfectly
fascinated
for
this
fresh
resplendent
soul
displayed
in
large
characters
the
radiant
word
love
have
you
never
read
this
word
in
a
maiden
two
eyes
seek
in
your
memory
and
seek
the
fairest
and
you
will
have
the
delightful
portrait
of
suzanne
i
am
unable
to
say
however
that
she
was
a
perfect
girl
what
girl
is
perfect
here
below
she
had
left
school
and
it
would
have
been
a
miracle
if
she
were
and
we
know
that
away
from
lourdes
god
works
no
more
miracles
she
had
even
many
faults
those
of
her
age
doubled
by
those
which
education
gives
to
girls
many
a
time
when
opening
the
holy
bible
the
only
book
capable
of
cheering
me
in
the
hours
of
sadness
i
have
come
across
these
words
of
ezekiel
they
are
proud
full
of
appetites
abounding
in
idleness
it
is
of
the
daughters
of
sodom
that
the
holy
prophet
is
complaining
what
would
he
say
to
young
of
our
modern
sodoms
but
if
the
little
suzanne
had
all
the
darling
faults
of
forward
flowers
forced
in
the
warm
soil
of
our
enervating
education
and
our
decayed
civilization
she
was
better
than
many
plainer
ones
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
sum
total
of
her
errors
could
weigh
heavy
on
her
conscience
perhaps
she
was
culpable
in
thought
but
if
the
imagination
was
sick
the
heart
was
good
and
sound
she
had
not
sinned
but
she
said
to
herself
that
sinning
would
be
sweet
well
there
is
no
great
crime
there
does
not
every
woman
love
instinctive
pleasure
among
them
there
are
few
stoics
they
who
are
so
are
so
by
compulsion
and
so
they
can
not
make
a
virtue
of
it
suzanne
loved
pleasure
then
and
she
loved
it
the
more
because
she
only
knew
it
by
the
education
of
had
contributed
no
little
to
develop
her
natural
disposition

has
been
said

its
curious
system

all
of

poor

brought
up
as
if
when
they
left

they
would
find
an

it
is
known
that
in
this
establishment
intended
for
the
daughters
of
officers
no
everything
is
taught
except
that
which
is
most
necessary
for
a
woman
to
know
they
leave
having
a
barren
superficial
education
principally
composed
of
words
and
in
which
consequently
to
the
exclusion
of

and
the

the
memory
plays
the
principal
part
none
of

none
of

indispensable
for
access

for
the

never
be
invited
to
see
and
they
return
to
their
father
humble
roof
dreaming
of
balls
fêtes
equipages
hotels
the
only
surroundings
in
which
they
could
profitably
display
the
useless
accomplishments
with
which
they
have
been
endowed
but
also
perfectly
incapable
of
darning
their
stockings
or
of
boiling
an
egg
and
so
they
soon
blush
at
their
father
obscure
condition
and
evince
a
mortal
disgust
of
the
modest
joys
of
the
poor
heavens
how
little
it
all
is
such
was
the
first
word
which
escaped
her
when
she
returned
to
her
father
house
she
had
grown
and
everything
she
saw
on
her
return
had
shrank
her
father
like
the
rest
perhaps
more
than
the
rest
she
loved
him
all
the
same
but
she
could
not
help
finding
him
common
she
the
dainty
young
lady
brought
up
with
the
daughters
of
and
generals
she
said
to
herself
that
she
was
only
the
daughter
of
an
obscure
captain
and
it
humiliated
her
ah
if
her
haughty
friends
with
whom
she
had
exchanged
confidences
and
dreams
had
seen
her
coming
down
the
sumptuous
stairs
of
her
castles
in
spain
to
go
and
live
in
a
poor
village
while
her
father
perspired
over
his
her
dreams
you
know
them
well
and
have
also
told
them
in
quiet
at
the
age
when
you
know
how
to
form
them
at
the
age
when
you
cease
to
be
called
a
little
girl
when
the
has
just
lengthened
your
dress
when
your
father
friends
are
no
longer
familiar
but
say
with
a
smile
at
the
age
when
you
feel
the
attraction
of
the
unknown
redouble
its
power
when
for
the
first
time
you
feel
a
conscious
blush
at
the
look
of
a
man
at
the
age
when
the
likeness
of
the
young
cousin
you
saw
yesterday
appears
all
at
once
on
the
page
of
your
history
or
grammar
and
strange
to
say
pursues
you
at
your
games
when
the
noisy
games
of
your
companions
weary
you
and
you
betake
yourself
to
solitude
in
order
to
screen
your
thoughts
and
solitude
a
bad
adviser
takes
possession
of
your
thoughts
isolates
them
from
the
rest
of
the
real
world
in
order
to
immerse
them
in
imaginary
worlds
and
then
agitates
reflects
whirls
polishes
all
that
marvellous
enchanted
universe
in
which
the
daughters
of
eve
wander
with
each
wild
license
whom
the
sons
of
adam
approach
only
a
single
step
but
when
that
step
is
taken
the
enchanted
world
vanishes
the
scaffolding
cracks
and
falls
down
palaces
geail
heroes
and
bounteous
fairies
disappear
into
the
lowest
depth
the
old
farce
of
humanity
the
comedy
of
love
is
played
out
ah
how
ugly
it
all
is
then
under
the
smoky
lamp
of
reality
you
vaguely
distinguish
the
battered
grotesque
shapes
rising
in
the
ruins
suzanne
therefore
like
all
her
young
friends
like
you
mademoiselle
and
also
like
you
formerly
madame
had
commenced
her
little
romance
had
sketched
her
little
plot
she
had
loved
oh
truly
loved
with
a
love
necessarily
confined
to
the
platonic
state
the
handsome
young
men
with
tasty
cravats
whom
she
had
seen
on
days
when
she
walked
out
what
delightful
chapters
were
sketched
upon
their
brown
or
fair
heads
oh
when
would
she
be
free
when
would
she
cease
to
have
the
eye
of
an
inquisitive
upon
her
slightest
gesture
and
then
the
day
of
liberty
had
come
and
under
the
breath
of
that
liberty
so
eagerly
and
impatiently
expected
the
chapters
she
had
begun
were
blotted
out
and
so
was
the
handsome
head
of
a
cherub
or
an
amadis
in
a
sublieutenant
cap
or
in
a
fallen
from
these
enervating
heights
of
fictitious
passions
and
scents
into
the
prosaic
but
generous
and
brave
arms
of
paternal
lore
on
the
breast
of
true
and
mighty
nature
she
had
forgotten
for
a
moment
her
dreams
she
lavished
on
her
father
all
the
treasures
of
affection
which
her
heart
contained
and
treated
him
with
all
manner
of
solicitude
and
caresses
and
the
old
soldier
before
this
youthful
future
which
shone
before
him
himself
forgot
his
dreams
of
the
past
xxviii
the
shadow
troubled
by
a
vague
emotion
i
said
to
myself
i
wanted
to
be
loved
and
i
looked
around
me
i
saw
no
one
who
inspired
me
with
love
no
one
who
appeared
to
me
capable
of
feeling
it
benjamin
constant
but
what
is
the
liberty
that
a
girl
can
enjoy
she
had
run
like
a
wild
thing
in
the
meadows
letting
her
hair
fly
in
the
wind
and
elated
by
the
kisses
of
the
breeze
she
had
relished
the
long
mornings
of
idleness
in
bed
recollecting
in
order
to
double
her
enjoyment
that
at
that
very
moment
the
friends
she
had
left
at
school
were
turning
pale
beneath
the
smoky
lamps
of
the
and
in
the
evening
she
read
the
delightful
novels
of
droz
by
her
lamp
and
thought
with
pleasure
that
her
same
friends
had
been
in
bed
for
a
long
while
then
she
closed
her
book
and
reflected
again
and
said
with
a
yawn
they
are
asleep
poor
little
things
and
i
am
awake
i
am
free
to
be
awake
and
she
wrote
long
letters
to
them
in
which
she
told
them
how
happy
she
was
assuming
a
charming
air
of
superiority
treating
them
as
children
who
knew
nothing
yet
of
life
but
she
thought
that
she
knew
nothing
more
of
it
herself
and
yearned
to
be
instructed
she
felt
that
there
was
something
wanting
and
that
her
father
affection
was
not
enough
to
fill
her
heart
she
had
looked
well
about
her
but
she
had
found
only
what
was
commonplace
no
more
young
clerks
with
curled
hair
who
darted
inflammatory
looks
at
the
women
from
behind
the
no
with
delicate
moustache
no
doctors
of
or
poets
of
eighteen
besides
her
father
and
the
notabilities
of
the
village
dignitaries
nothing
but
peasants
only
she
held
the
belief
which
all
girls
hold
a
nice
little
belief
very
convenient
and
very
simple
the
sweet
jesus
the
paschal
lamb
and
the
immaculate
conception
around
this
trio
gravitated
all
the
rest
but
graceful
and
light
as
the
mists
which
float
at
therefore
the
captain
had
not
thought
it
his
duty
to
disappoint
his
daughter
when
she
said
to
him
one
sunday
morning
my
darling
papa
i
am
going
to
mass
he
let
her
go
grumbling
and
she
noticed
marcel
the
fine
figure
of
the
priest
struck
her
she
was
touched
by
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
while
she
fixed
her
gaze
upon
him
she
encountered
his
and
their
eyes
fell
in
the
days
when
she
took
her
walks
at
and
saw
for
the
first
time
that
she
was
admired
by
some
handsome
young
men
she
had
not
experienced
a
more
delicious
emotion
she
was
astonished
and
almost
ashamed
at
it
and
nevertheless
she
returned
for
vespers
on
purpose
to
see
the
curé
she
soon
gained
the
certainty
that
she
had
attracted
his
attention
and
she
was
flattered
at
it
what
she
a
little
was
she
distracting
from
his
prayers
at
the
very
foot
of
the
altar
a
minister
of
the
altar
she
felt
herself
rise
in
importance
but
her
natural
modesty
made
her
reflect
directly
has
he
looked
at
me
because
i
am
a
stranger
or
because
i
am
pretty
she
was
almost
afraid
that
it
was
not
this
latter
reason
marcel
eyes
reassured
her
nevertheless
the
first
impulse
of
satisfied
what
did
it
concern
her
how
did
this
priest
admiration
affect
her
is
a
priest
a
man
it
must
be
no
more
thought
of
but
she
could
not
prevent
herself
from
thinking
of
him
being
pleased
at
his
finding
her
pretty
others
doubtless
had
found
her
pretty
before
he
did
perhaps
had
told
her
so
in
a
whisper
but
was
that
the
same
thing
the
silent
admiration
of
this
grave
personage
clothed
in
a
sacred
character
raised
her
all
at
once
in
her
own
eyes
more
than
a
thousand
warm
glances
or
timid
declarations
from
insignificant
and
youths
besides
he
was
young
he
was
handsome
and
his
position
his
studies
placed
him
far
above
the
ignorant
and
common
people
whom
she
elbowed
since
her
return
at
night
the
pale
fine
countenance
of
the
curé
of
althausen
crossed
her
dreams
several
times
she
was
not
disturbed
at
it
but
she
said
to
herself
that
she
would
like
to
have
a
closer
acquaintance
with
this
shepherd
of
men
who
had
made
so
deep
an
impression
on
her
she
was
affected
by
his
grave
voice
soft
and
sad
more
than
by
his
look
and
with
a
simplicity
she
asked
herself
if
a
heart
could
not
beat
beneath
that
black
robe
the
visit
of
marcel
filled
her
with
a
strange
trouble
and
she
hesitated
a
long
time
before
showing
herself
to
him
then
the
bitter
raillery
of
her
father
tortured
her
heart
and
wounded
her
in
her
delicate
maidenly
sentiments
she
suffered
more
than
he
from
the
insults
which
he
received
and
she
vowed
to
herself
to
have
them
forgiven
xxix
other
meetings
there
was
no
seduction
on
her
part
or
on
mine
love
simply
came
and
i
was
her
lover
before
i
had
even
thought
that
i
could
become
so
maxime
du
camp
they
saw
one
another
again
very
soon
sometimes
on
the
road
which
leads
to
the
little
chapel
of
saint
anne
sometimes
behind
the
village
gardens
other
times
on
the
lined
with
poplars
from
the
furthest
point
at
which
he
caught
sight
of
her
dress
or
her
large
trimmed
with
red
ribbon
he
trembled
and
became
pale
the
first
time
he
quickened
his
pace
as
he
passed
her
as
though
he
were
afraid
of
being
retained
by
a
force
stronger
than
his
own
will
or
perhaps
from
fear
of
ridicule
and
he
bowed
to
her
as
one
bows
to
a
queen
she
returned
his
bow
graciously
and
that
was
all
he
had
his
sum
of
happiness
for
the
rest
of
the
day
the
second
time
they
met
they
had
both
thought
so
much
of
one
another
that
they
accosted
one
another
like
old
acquaintances
the
heart
of
each
had
broken
the
ice
and
made
all
the
advances
before
they
had
taken
the
first
steps
the
young
girl
had
read
in
the
priest
eyes
the
wish
to
accost
her
and
he
saw
that
he
would
be
welcome
was
anything
more
necessary
therefore
mutually
content
when
they
separated
they
each
had
the
desire
to
see
the
other
again
it
was
very
often
then
that
they
saw
one
another
but
especially
at
the
morning
masses
then
when
he
turned
towards
the
nave
and
raising
his
look
towards
the
gallery
encountered
hers
he
asked
no
other
joy
from
heaven
xxx
seraphic
love
how
many
times
does
it
not
occur
to
me
to
blush
at
my
tastes
to
hide
them
from
myself
to
feign
with
myself
that
i
have
them
not
to
find
some
covering
for
them
beneath
which
i
conceal
them
in
order
to
play
a
part
a
little
less
foolish
in
my
own
conscience
jules
simon
but
one
day
the
curé
awoke
full
of
dismay
the
first
intoxication
had
slightly
dissipated
he
had
taken
time
to
look
closely
within
himself
and
when
he
sought
to
analyze
in
cool
blood
this
new
and
ravishing
sensation
he
saw
the
abyss
beneath
his
feet
what
he
said
to
himself
whither
am
i
going
what
am
i
doing
i
a
priest
a
minister
of
the
altar
i
should
be
at
that
point
a
slave
of
sin
i
shall
continue
to
cast
myself
from
darkness
to
darkness
until
the
definite
and
final
fall
oh
lord
stop
me
come
to
my
aid
suffer
not
this
shame
and
this
crime
but
he
altered
his
mind
when
the
devil
has
succeeded
in
bringing
a
soul
to
sin
there
is
no
artifice
he
does
not
use
to
blind
him
beforehand
and
to
turn
away
his
thought
from
everything
capable
of
making
him
see
the
unhappy
state
in
which
he
is
that
is
what
the
church
teaches
soon
he
viewed
this
passion
under
a
new
aspect
and
he
asked
himself
why
he
had
not
the
right
to
love
had
not
all
the
saints
loved
had
not
jerome
loved
paula
had
not
francis
de
sales
loved
madame
de
chantal
had
not
fénélon
loved
madame
guyon
theresa
her
spiritual
director
and
venillot
his
cook
were
there
not
two
kinds
of
love
the
ethereal
ideal
chaste
seraphic
love
the
love
of
the
creature
grateful
for
the
perfect
work
of
the
creator
platonic
love
free
from
all
impurity
allowed
to
the
virtuous
confessor
for
his
virtuous
penitent
the
love
of
the
wise
man
in
fact
or
the
other
then
with
that
art
of
the
rhetorician
which
sacred
scholasticism
teaches
to
every
levite
he
said
to
himself
yes
i
can
love
for
it
is
the
spotless
love
of
the
angels
but
his
conscience
protested
and
cried
to
him
it
is
the
other
xxxi
the
virgin
in
whatever
place
i
was
whatever
occupation
i
imposed
on
myself
i
could
not
think
of
women
the
sight
of
a
woman
made
me
tremble
how
many
times
have
i
risen
at
night
bathed
in
sweat
to
fasten
my
mouth
on
our
ramparts
feeling
myself
ready
to
suffocate
a
de
musset
enfant
du
it
was
the
other
he
was
soon
obliged
to
confess
this
to
himself
for
slumber
abandoned
his
couch
in
vain
in
the
he
wearied
his
body
under
the
labour
which
kills
thought
he
sought
to
fly
from
the
seductive
image
he
did
not
go
out
for
fear
of
seeing
her
he
rushed
upon
every
hard
and
unfruitful
labour
that
he
could
find
he
rooted
up
his
trees
in
order
to
them
elsewhere
dug
useless
banks
in
his
garden
changed
his
library
from
its
place
and
carried
one
after
another
his
enormous
folios
to
the
upper
story
he
would
have
liked
to
go
upon
the
road
sit
at
the
bottom
of
some
ditch
and
take
the
hammer
but
the
thought
which
he
silenced
by
day
took
its
revenge
by
night
how
many
times
during
the
long
silent
hours
his
servant
heard
him
get
up
all
at
once
and
march
with
long
steps
in
his
room
as
if
he
had
to
accomplish
some
terrible
vow
it
was
the
devil
whispering
low
mysterious
words
in
his
ear
while
his
impetuous
desires
constrained
him
with
all
the
power
of
his
vitality
he
walked
like
a
madman
from
his
bed
to
his
window
which
he
dared
not
open
he
had
often
formerly
leant
his
elbows
there
during
the
hours
of
sleeplessness
and
breathed
with
delight
the
keen
freshness
of
the
valley
but
now
he
dared
no
longer
warm
vapours
rose
up
to
him
and
completed
the
conflagration
of
his
senses
nature
was
from
the
long
slumber
of
winter
and
already
setting
to
work
was
accomplishing
from
every
quarter
the
mysterious
work
of
love
and
within
and
without
he
felt
its
formidable
power
growing
and
enveloping
him
nameless
thoughts
tumultuously
invaded
his
sick
brain
and
ruled
there
as
despots
they
attached
themselves
to
him
like
an
implacable
furious
old
woman
who
attaches
herself
the
more
closely
to
her
young
lover
the
more
she
feels
he
is
going
to
escape
her
he
saw
again
in
continual
hallucinations
sometimes
the
lascivious
player
as
she
had
appeared
to
him
near
her
little
white
bed
sometimes
the
fresh
face
of
the
religious
who
smiled
to
him
from
the
height
of
the
gallery
at
other
times
he
saw
them
both
together
and
each
of
them
called
him
and
said
to
him
come
come
oh
why
all
these
obstacles
these
doors
these
walls
these
prejudices
and
that
formidable
barrier
which
he
dared
not
pass
duty
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
burning
lava
was
escaping
from
his
heart
running
into
his
veins
and
devouring
him
his
limbs
were
heavy
and
bruised
his
head
was
on
fire
like
his
heart
and
his
thoughts
were
enveloped
in
mire
often
with
his
eye
fixed
on
space
he
contemplated
some
phantom
visible
to
himself
alone
then
big
tears
rolled
slowly
on
his
cheeks
and
fell
one
by
one
on
his
bare
chest
and
he
felt
that
they
relieved
him
he
had
placed
a
statue
of
the
virgin
at
the
foot
of

the
one
which
has
a
heart
in
flames
and

he
looked
on
it
as
he
went
to
sleep
and
prayed
the
mother
eternally
chaste
to
watch
over
his
dreams
but
many
times
in
his
delirium
he
saw
the
virgin
come
to
life
and
take
the
face
of
her
from
whom
he
sought
to
flee
and
come
and
find
him
in
his
couch
and
he
woke
with
a
start
full
of
terror
of
himself
at
the
moment
when
in
his
impious
sacrilege
he
felt
the
chaste
bosom
of
the
mother
of
god
quiver
beneath
his
kisses
then
he
opened
his
scared
eyes
and
perceived
before
him
the
sweet
form
which
stretched
its
plaster
arms
to
him
in
the
shadow
and
full
of
agony
he
cried
inviolata

once
he
thought
he
heard
a
voice
which
answered

went
out
by

crossed

and
descended
the
hill
he
had
the
look
of
a
man
who
was
hiding
himself
and
he
went
back
several
times
as
if
he
was
afraid
of
being
followed
he
reached
the
cemetery
took
a
key
from
his
pocket
cautiously
opened
the
gate
and
closed
it
behind
him
at
the
bottom
of
the
principal
path
there
was
a
little
chapel
which
served
for
an
ossuary
in
it
was
a
hideous
accumulation
of
the
remains
of
several
generations
the
cemetery
was
becoming
too
full
and
it
had
been
necessary
to
make
room
here
as
elsewhere
the
cry
was
room
for
the
young
and
it
is
only
justice
what
would
become
of

all
the

remained

the
common
grave
is
again

which
must
be
taken

the

want
everything

lighted

and

then
he
returned
to
the
parsonage
like
a
thief
afraid
of
being
caught
and
shut
himself
up
in

had
a

under

he
opened

broken
up

the

with

and

that

a

while
he
went
to
his

took
the

from
its
pedestal
and
taking
in
his
two
hands
the

he
put
it
in
its
place
between

and
when
the
fever
seized
him
when
he
was
burning
with
all
the
flames
which
the
fiery
of
passion
breathed
on
him
and
he
felt
the

taking

he
turned
towards

looked
at

lighted
up
the
hideous
skull
and
played
in

gloomy
cavities
of
its

eyes
the
head
then
seemed
to
become
animate

gave
an

without

before
the

seized
him
and
shook
him
before
the

it
clothed

again
with

it
planted

upon

shining

forehead
it
placed
in
the

orbits
large
eyes
full
of
love
it
hid
the
wasted
cartillages
under
quivering
nostrils
and
upon
that
horrible
jaw
it
laid
rosy
lips
and
a
sweet
mouth
like
a

it
is
thus
that
it
appeared
to
him
in

in
the

in

sixteen
years
and
he
stretched
his
arms
towards
the
enchanting
vision
while
the
with
its
bare
jaw
gave
its
eternal
grin
he
woke
and
found
himself
kneeling
near
his
bed
facing
the
wreck
of
humanity
horror
soiled
him
his
empty
room
was
filled
with
spectres
he
saw
with
sporting
and
swarming
on
his
bed
at
the
same
time
little
sharp
hasty
shrill
knocks
shook
his
window
fall
of

he
ran
to
open
it
a
gust
of
wind
mingled
with
rain
and

heat
against
his
face
he
was
ashamed
of
his
fears
and
leant
his
head
out
to
catch
the
beneficent
shower
his
brain
cooled
and
his
blood
grew
calm
he
was
there
for
a
few

when
all
at

under

he
distinguished
two
motionless
shadows

thought
for
an
instant
that
his
hallucination
lasted
still
but
soon
the
shadows
drew
near
they
seemed
to
walk
carefully
under
the
young
foliage
of
the
limes
in
order
to
avoid
the
rain
and
in
one
of
them
he
recognized

where

you
are
playing

now
he
said
to
her
do
you
like
this
piece
father
not
at
all
perhaps
said
suzanne
smiling
because
it
is
a
mass
my
dear
child
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
what
you
are
with
all
your
masses
what
where
did
you
go
this
morning
at
what
time
at
the
time
when
you
went
out
i
only
went
out
to
go
to
mass
and
the
day
before
yesterday
why
this
questioning
dearest
papa
ah
dearest
papa
dearest
papa
there
is
no
dearest
papa
here
i
want
to
know
the
truth
but
what
truth
i
have
nothing
wrong
to
hide
from
you
i
went
to
mass
is
that
forbidden
to
mass
good
heavens
to
mass
that
is
most
decidedly
making
up
your
mind
to
disobey
me
but
papa
you
have
not
forbidden
it
to
me
not
in
so
many
words
it
is
true
because
i
counted
on
your
reason
and
good
sense
have
i
not
spoken
loudly
enough
my
way
of
thinking
on
this
subject
but
papa
your
way
of
thinking
is
completely
contrary
to
that
which
i
have
been
taught
you
ought
to
have
said
when
you
sent
me
to
you
are
not
to
teach
my
daughter
any
religion
they
have
taught
me
religion
what
is
more
natural
than
for
me
to
follow
it
and
what
has
your
religion
in
common
with
your
mass
if
you
want
to
pray
to
god
can
you
not
pray
to
him
at
home
am
i
not
a
catholic
before
all
it
was
the
first
time
that
suzanne
had
spoken
to
her
father
in
this
firm
and
decided
tone
nothing
more
was
wanted
to
irritate
the
irascible
soldier
ah
i
know
the
hidden
and
villainous
insinuation
he
cried
catholic
before
all
it
is
that
indeed

being

before
being

before
being

comes
after

the

the

the

with
that
they
cover

do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
what
i
think
of
women
who
frequent
churches
they
are
either
lazy
or
hypocrites
or
idiots
or
finally
hussies
in
love
with
the
curé
there
are
no
others
in
which
category
do
you
want
to
be
placed
my
daughter
and
all
that
because
i
discharge
my
religious
duties
you
have
spoken
to
that
curé
i
see
it
where
have
you
spoken
to
him
i
have
nothing
to
hide
from
you
father
but
monsieur
marcel
had
not
given
me
any
bad
advice
i
ask
you
to
believe
so
it
is
true
then
you
have
spoken
to
this
man
unknown
to
me
in
secret
i
had
no
secret
to
make
of
it
i
went
to
confession
that
is
all
as
i
was
accustomed
to
do
at
school
confession
what
good
heavens
you
went
and
knelt
before
that
rascal
after
what
i
have
told
you
concerning
all
his
like
all
priests
are
not
alike
ah
you
are
under
his
influence
already
doubtless
he
is
the
pearl
the
model
the
saint
thunder
of
heaven
my
daughter
too
but
you
do
not
know
that
your
mother
died
of
remorse
of
soul
because
she
found
a
saint
a
model
of
virtue
in
that
black
crew
of
scoundrels
stay
be
silent
you
make
me
say
too
much
i
do
understand
you
i
will
be
obeyed
and
not
questioned
have
i
the
right
to
expect
that
from
my
daughter
you
have
every
right
father
well
i
forbid
you
for
the
future
to
put
your
foot
inside
the
church
in
truth
father
would
not
one
say
that
you
were
talking
of
some
place
worse
than
that
those
who
enter
a
place
of
know
beforehand
where
they
go
and
to
what
they
expose
themselves
which
the
little
fools
who
frequent
churches
never
know
suzanne
made
no
reply
and
went
down
into
the
garden
the
old
governess
who
bad
brought
her
up
and
who
loved
her
tenderly
came
to
meet
her
your
father
is
after
the
curés
again
what
can
these
poor
people
of
god
have
done
to
the
man
they
walked
a
long
time
round
the
then
they
sat
down
under
an
arbour
of
honeysuckle
what
time
is
it
marianne
the
young
girl
said
all
at
once
fixing
her
eyes
on
the
window
of
her
father
room
it
is
late
my
child
it
is
ten
at
least
everybody
in
the
village
has
gone
to
bed
come
your
father
has
finished
his
newspaper
there
is
no
longer
any
light
in
his
room
he
has
just
blown
out
his
lamp
let
us
go
in
they
were
near
the
little
which
led
out
to
the
meadows
suzanne
opened
it
cautiously
no
let
us
go
out
she
said
xxxv
the
shelter
is
it
a
chance
no
and
besides
chance
what
is
it
after
all
but
the
effect
of
a
cause
which
escapes
us
as
soon
as
marcel
had
recognized
suzanne
he
did
not
take
time
to
reflect
and
say
to
himself
what
is
it
you
are
going
to
do
idiot
he
ran
downstairs
stumbling
like
a
drunken
man
and
gently
opened
the
door
what
did
he
intend
he
did
not
know
was
he
going
to
call
these
women
he
did
not
know
he
opened
his
door
that
was
all
and
his
thought
went
no
further
the
same
morning
at
church
he
had
seen
suzanne
and
said
to
himself
i
will
not
look
at
her
he
did
not
look
at
her
he
kept
his
eyes
lowered
when
he
turned
towards
the
nave
but
he
could
have
said
how
many
times
suzanne
lifted
hers
if
she
were
joyous
or
sad
and
if
she
had
a
red
ribbon
or
a
blue
ribbon
at
her
neck
oh
the
eternal
contradiction
of
mankind
he
had
not
wanted
to
look
at
her
by
day
and
here
he
is
throwing
himself
in
her
path
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
steps
approached
and
his
heart
beat
with
violence
he
was
so
agitated
that
at
the
moment
when
the
two
women
passed
before
his
door
to
reach
the
lane
which
led
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
he
could
hardly
articulate
in
a
hesitating
voice
mademoiselle
durand
they
uttered
a
cry
it
is
i
he
said
coming
forward
is
it
possible
you
here
at
such
an
hour
and
in
the
rain
i
had
gone
out
with
my
maid
said
suzanne
and
the
rain
has
surprised
us
do
not
go
farther
shelter
yourselves
under
my
door
it
is
an
april
shower
it
will
soon
have
passed
at
the
same
time
he
went
down
the
steps
before
the
house
and
took
hand
never
had
he
felt
such
boldness
i
pray
mademoiselle
do
not
refuse
me
the
pleasure
of
offering
you
a
refuge
for
a
few
moments
beneath
my
humble
roof
suzanne
accepted
without
making
him
plead
any
more
she
went
up
the
stairs
and
entered
the
corridor
the
servant
followed
her
at
the
end
on
the
first
steps
of
the
a
lamp
swung
to
and
fro
in
the
wind
the
curé
shut
the
door
again
and
passing
near
the
two
women
drawn
up
against
the
wall
he
brushed
against
the
young
girl
damp
dress
with
his
hand
but
you
are
wet
mademoiselle
he
said
to
her
perhaps
it
would
not
be
wise
to
remain
in
this
cold
passage
should
i
dare
to
ask
you
to
go
upstairs
an
instant
and
warm
yourself
at
my
fire
his
voice
trembled
with
emotion
and
he
found
that
his
hand
was
so
near
hers
that
he
had
only
to
close
his
fingers
to
take
suzanne
he
seized
it
therefore
and
inflicting
on
her
a
gentle
violence
go
up
i
pray
go
up
he
said
she
allowed
him
to
conduct
her
he
showed
them
into
his
library
which
was
his
favourite
apartment
the
sanctuary
of
his
labours
his
griefs
and
his
dreams
he
took
some
which
he
threw
in
the
fireplace
and
soon
a
cheerful
flame
lighted
up
the
hearth

the
hot
wine
i
looked
at
her
she
tried
to
show
nothing
of
what
she
felt
in
her
heart
she
held
herself
straight
like
an
oarsman
who
feels
that
the
current
is
carrying
him
away
and
her
nostrils

sitting
in
the

of

the
seat
of

of
the

her
huge
dark
eyes
followed
the
curling
flames
while

standing
up
against

of
the
sides
of
the
cast
around
her
an
inquisitive
and
timorous
look
the

with

knee
on

ground
was
drawing
up

fire

said
as
he
got
up
come
close
mademoiselle
your
feet
are
doubtless
damp
it
is
cold
do
you
find
it
so
he
was
trembling
in
all
his
limbs
as
if
indeed
he
were
frozen
near
this
blazing
fire

put
forward

any
hour
it
is
open
to
the
poor
man
who
passes
by
it
is
open
sometimes
to
the
vagabond
why
should
it
not
be
to
an
angelic
young
lady
who
seeks
a
shelter
against
the
storm
it
is
true
it
is
the
house
of
god
said
marianne
the
young
girl
looked
at
the
priest
smiled
and
then
became
thoughtful
she
appeared
soon
no
longer
to
be
conscious
where
she
was
nor
of
the
priest
who
remained
standing
before
her
she
knitted
her
eyebrows
and
a
feverish
shudder
ran
through
her
frame
marcel
stooped
down
towards
her
with
anxiety
are
you
in
pain
he
said
she
shook
her
head
as
if
to
drive
away
a
world
of
thought
which
possessed
her
and
answered
with
a
kind
of
hesitation
no
monsieur
thank
you
i
am
not
in
pain
but
i
tremble
to
find
myself
here
what
will
my
father
say
and
you
monsieur
what
will
you
think
of
me
but
what
are
you
frightened
at
mademoiselle
said
marianne
we
are
here
because
monsieur
le
curé
has
had
the
goodness
to
bring
us
in
do
you
hear
the
rain
outside
as
to
your
father
he
is
not
obliged
to
know
that
we
are
at
monsieur
le
curé
reassure
yourself
mademoiselle
your
father
can
not
be
offended
because
you
have
accepted
a
shelter
against
the
bad
weather
you
are
here
as
the
good
marianne
has
just
said
in
the
house
of
god
and
i
will
say
in
my
turn
beneath
the
eye
of
god
these
are
very
great
words
about
so
small
a
matter
he
added
with
a
smile
but
you
are
in
pain
ah
you
see
you
have
a
cold
already
he
proposed
making
her
take
a
little
warm
wine
which
marianne
declared
to
be
a
sovereign
remedy
and
spoke
of
going
to
wake
up
his
servant
marianne
opposed
this
with
all
her
power
since
you
have
the
kindness
to
offer
something
to
our
dear
young
lady
she
said
let
me
make
it
good
heavens
to
wake
up
mademoiselle
veronica
what
would
she
say
that
i
am
good
for
nothing
and
she
would
be
right
well
said
marcel
i
am
going
to
show
you
where
you
will
find
what
is
necessary
they
both
went
down
to
the
kitchen
as
quietly
as
possible
so
as
not
to
disturb
veronica
slumber
and
marianne
declared
that
with
an
armful
of
dry
wood
she
would
have
finished
in
a
few
minutes
then
i
leave
you
said
the
priest
i
must
not
leave
mademoiselle
suzanne
alone
he
remained
several
seconds
longer
hesitating
following
the
movements
of
the
old
governess
without
seeing
them
then
all
at
once
he
quickly
remounted
the
xxxvi
is
yours
to
use
aright
the
hour
which
destiny
may
leave
you
to
drain
the
cup
of

des
he
halted
at
the
threshold
pale
and
trembling
as
if
he
were
about
to
commit
a
crime
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
it
was
damp
with
a
cold
sweat
what
suzanne
was
there
in
his
house
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
his
own
room
beside
his
fire
seated
in
his
oh
blessed
vision
was
it
possible
was
he
dreaming
would
the
charming
picture
disappear
and
he
remained
there
motionless
anxious
not
daring
to
move
a
step
for
fear
of
seeing
her
disappear
but
yes
it
is
she
indeed
she
has
hidden
her
charming
face
in
her
hands
and
it
seems
to
him
that
tears
are
stealing
through
her
fingers
he
sprang
towards
her
oh
mademoiselle
what
is
the
matter
what
is
the
matter
why
these
tears
which
break
my
heart
confide
your
troubles
to
me
and
i
swear
to
you
if
it
be
in
my
power
i
will
alleviate
them
you
can
not
answered
suzanne
sadly
lifting
to
him
her
great
moist
eyes
i
can
not
do
not
believe
that
my
child
the
priest
can
do
many
things
he
knows
how
to
comfort
souls
it
is
the
most
precious
of
his
gifts
do
not
hesitate
to
confide
your
griefs
to
the
priest
to
the
friend
he
sat
down
facing
her
waiting
for
her
to
speak
but
she
remained
silent
he
only
heard
the
rapid
breathing
of
the
young
girl
and
the
storm
which
raged
in
his
own
heart
at
length
he
broke
the
silence
mademoiselle
dear
young
lady
he
said
with
his
most
insinuating
voice
do
you
lack
confidence
then
in
me
ah
i
see
but
too
well
your
prejudices
have
left
their
marks
do
not
believe
it
she
cried
eagerly
do
not
believe
it
thank
you
dear
young
lady
i
should
so
much
wish
to
have
your
confidence
and
in
whom
could
you
better
repose
it
what
others
could
receive
more
discreetly
than
ourselves
the
trust
of
secret
sufferings
ah
that
is
one
of
the
benefits
of
our
holy
religion
it
is
on
that
account
that
she
is
the
consolation
of
those
who
are
sad
the
relief
of
those
who
suffer
the
refuge
of
the
humble
and
the
weak
the
joy
of
all
the
afflicted
her
strong
arms
are
open
to
all
human
kind
but
how
small
is
the
number
of
the
chosen
who
wish
to
profit
by
this
maternal
tenderness
be
one
of
that
number
dear
child
come
to
us
to
us
who
stretch
out
our
arms
to
you
to
me
who
now
say
to
you
open
your
heart
to
me
confide
to
me
your
troubles
however
sick
your
soul
may
be
mine
will
understand
it
the
priest
voice
was
troubled
and
it
went
to
the
bottom
of
heart
she
cast
on
him
a
look
full
of
compassion
you
are
unhappy
she
asked
do
not
say
that
do
not
say
that
unhappy
yes
i
may
have
been
so
but
now
i
am
so
no
longer
are
you
not
there
has
not
your
presence
caused
all
the
dark
clouds
to
fly
away
no
i
am
no
longer
unhappy
it
would
be
a
blasphemy
to
say
so
when
god
has
permitted
you
by
some
way
or
other
of
his
mysterious
and
infinite
wisdom
to
come
and
bring
happiness
to
my
hearth
happiness
i
bring
happiness
to
you
but
who
am
i
a
little
girl
just
out
of
school
who
knows
nothing
of
life
and
that
is
what
makes
you
more
charming
you
are
a
rose
which
the
breath
of
morning
pure
as
it
is
has
not
yet
touched
life
dear
child
do
not
seek
to
know
it
too
soon
it
is
a
vale
of
tears
and
those
who
know
it
best
are
those
who
have
suffered
most
deception
and
weeping
but
a
priest
is
safe
from
deception
and
sorrows
ah
mademoiselle
you
with
that
clear
and
honest
look
you
do
not
know
all
that
passes
at
the
bottom
of
a
man
heart
alas
we
priests
we
are
but
men
more
miserable
than
others
that
is
the
difference
yes
more
miserable
because
we
are
more
alone
ah
you
can
not
understand
how
painful
it
is
never
to
have
anybody
to
whom
you
can
open
your
heart
no
one
to
partake
your
joys
and
mitigate
your
griefs
no
loved
soul
to
respond
to
your
soul
no
intellect
to
understand
your
intellect
alone
eternally
alone
that
is
our
lot
we
are
men
of
all
families
friends
of
all
and
we
have
no
friends
counsellors
to
all
and
no
one
gives
us
salutary
advice
directors
of
all
consciences
and
we
have
no
one
to
direct
ours
but
the
evil
thoughts
which
spring
from
our
weariness
and
our
isolation
but
why
do
i
speak
to
you
of
all
that
am
i
mad
let
us
talk
about
yourself
come
dear
child
i
have
made
my
little
disclosures
to
you
make
yours
to
me
open
your
heart
to
me
speak
speak
well
yes
i
wanted
to
see
you
to
speak
with
you
to
ask
your
advice
i
used
to
meet
you
before
from
time
to
time
in
your
walks
now
you
never
go
out
i
have
gone
to
mass
notwithstanding
the
displeasure
it
causes
my
father
i
thought
your
looks
avoided
mine
what
have
i
done
to
you
i
believe
i
have
done
anything
wrong
this
evening
i
had
a
dispute
with
my
father
i
went
out
not
knowing
where
i
went
the
rain
overtook
us
and
i
met
you
marcel
trembled
he
had
taken
the
young
girl
hand
but
he
quickly
dropped
it
fearing
she
might
observe
his
agitation
ah
suzanne
continued
there
are
hours
when
i
miss
the
school
my
companions
the
long
cold
corridors
our
silent
even
the
i
am
ashamed
of
it
and
angry
with
myself
but
i
it
is
this
then
that
liberty
i
so
desired
i
was
a
prisoner
then
but
i
was
peaceful
i
was
happy
i
see
it
now
weariness
consumes
me
here
i
see
no
aim
for
my
life
i
had
one
consolation
my
religious
duties
that
is
taken
away
from
me
for
my
father
has
formally
forbidden
me
this
evening
to
go
to
church
if
i
go
there
again
i
disobey
my
father
and
i
grieve
him
if
i
obey
his
orders
i
take
away
the
only
happiness
of
my
life
she
had
spoken
with
volubility
and
the
priest
listened
to
her
in
silence
hanging
on
her
look
he
drank
in
her
words
he
heard
them
without
comprehending
exactly
their
meaning
it
was
sweet
music
which
charmed
him
but
he
only
thought
of
one
thing
she
had
said
your
looks
avoided
mine
when
she
had
finished
speaking
he
was
surprised
to
hear
her
no
longer
and
listened
afresh
i
have
spoken
with
open
heart
to
my
confessor
said
suzanne
timidly
astonished
at
this
silence
to
the
confessor
no
no
dear
child
to
the
friend
to
the
friend
is
it
not
do
you
want
him
will
you
trust
yourself
to
me
will
you
let
yourself
be
guided
by
me
i
will
bring
you
by
a
way
from
which
i
will
remove
all
the
thorns
but
my
father
this
was
like
the
blow
from
a
club
to
marcel
your
father
ah
yes
your
father
well
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
i
have
just
asked
you
it
is
written
in
the
gospel
no
one
can
serve
two
masters
at
the
same
time
you
have
a
master
who
is
god
your
father
places
himself
between
god
and
your
duty
you
must
choose
suzanne
did
not
reply
consult
your
conscience
my
child
what
says
your
conscience
my
conscience
says
nothing
to
me
marcel
thought
perhaps
he
had
gone
a
little
too
far
he
added
you
must
decide
nevertheless
it
is
also
written
render
unto
caesar
the
things
that
are
caesar
and
to
god
the
things
that
are
god
how
am
i
to
unite
the
respect
and
submission
which
i
owe
to
my
father
with
my
duties
as
a
christian
that
repeated
suzanne
is
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
and
we
will
solve
the
problem
dear
child
yes
we
will
come
forth
from
this
evil
pass
to
our
advantage
and
to
our
glory
nothing
happens
but
by
the
will
of
god
and
it
is
he
doubt
it
not
who
has
guided
you
into
my
path
in
order
that
i
may
take
care
of
your
young
and
beautiful
soul
the
ancients
were
in
the
habit
of
marking
their
happy
days
i
count
already
two
days
in
my
life
which
i
shall
never
obliterate
from
my
memory
two
days
marked
in
the
golden
book
of
my
remembrances
the
one
is
that
on
which
i
saw
you
for
the
first
time
you
were
in
the
gallery
of
our
church
the
light
was
streaming
behind
you
through
the
painted
windows
and
surrounded
you
with
a
halo
i
said
to
myself
is
it
not
one
of
the
virgins
detached
from
the
window
the
other
is
do
you
believe
in
presentiments
mademoiselle
sometimes
well
i
had
a
presentiment
as
it
were
of
this
visit
yes
shall
i
dare
to
tell
you
so
the
whole
day
i
have
been
wild
with
joy
i
had
an
intuition
of
an
approaching
happiness
a
very
rare
event
with
me
mademoiselle
of
what
happiness
why
of
this
of
this
which
i
enjoy
at
this
moment
this
of
seeing
you
sitting
at
my
hearth
in
front
of
me
near
to
me
this
of
hearing
your
sweet
voice
and
reading
your
pure
eyes
but
what
am
i
saying
pardon
me
mademoiselle
see
how
happiness
make
us
egotistic
i
talk
to
you
about
myself
while
it
is
about
you
that
we
ought
to
occupy
ourselves
of
you
and
of
your
future
and
he
looked
at
her
with
such
glowing
eyes
that
she
was
a
little
frightened
xxxviii
the
kiss
that
strange
kiss
makes
me
shudder
still
a
de
musset
are
you
not
cold
said
marcel
and
he
stooped
down
to
draw
up
the
fire
but
on
sitting
down
again
it
happened
that
his
seat
was
quite
close
to
that
of
suzanne
so
close
that
their
knees
were
touching
and
that
he
had
only
to
make
a
slight
movement
to
take
one
of
her
hands
dear
dear
child
and
he
began
to
talk
to
her
of
god
in
his
unctuous
voice
he
talked
to
her
also
of
her
duties
as
a
christian
and
of
the
probable
struggles
she
would
have
to
undergo
he
talked
to
her
again
of
the
purity
of
her
heart
and
compared
her
to
the
angels
and
while
he
talked
he
began
to
fondle
this
little
soft
white
hand
lifting
delicately
the
slender
fingers
with
their
rosy
nails
drawing
over
the
soft
and
satiny
tips
his
brown
and
muscular
fingers
soon
his
warm
hand
became
burning
magnetic
influences
were
evolved
invisible
sparks
broke
forth
suddenly
at
the
contact
of
these
two
epidermises
ran
through
his
veins
inflamed
his
heart
and
set
his
brain
plate
ii
the
kiss
she
tried
to
release
her
imprisoned
hand
but
he
bent
over
it
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
illustration
he
lost
his
presence
of
mind
his
will
wavered
and
sank
in
the
molten
lava
of
his
desires
he
lost
perception
of
his
surroundings
of
all
those
formidable
things
which
until
then
had
bound
him
with
the
strong
bands
of
moral
authority
he
thought
no
longer
of
anything
he
paused
no
longer
at
anything
he
saw
nothing
but
this
fair
young
girl
whom
he
coveted
who
was
alone
with
him
her
hand
in
his
sitting
by
his
in
the
silence
and
the
mystery
of
the
night
his
clasp
became
convulsive
under
the
fire
of
his
burning
gaze
suzanne
raised
her
head
and
a
second
time
fell
back
in
dismay
she
tried
to
release
her
imprisoned
hand
but
he
bent
over
it
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
the
door
opened
wide
do
get
impatient
said
marianne
there
is
the
hot
wine
i
have
been
a
long
time
but
the
wood
was
green
are
you
better
but
suzanne
trembling
all
over
remained
silent

know
an
infallible
means
of
drawing
you
back
from
the
precipice
on
which
you
stand
charles
illustres
wretch
that
i
am
i
have
defiled
a
pure
confiding
child
who
came
in
all
loyalty
to
sit
at
my
vile
and
cowardly
nature
like
some
base
lovelace
i
have
grossly
abused
the
confidence
which
was
placed
in
me
my
priestly
robe
far
from
being
a
safeguard
is
but
a
cloke
for
my
iniquities
i
have
reached
that
pitch
of
cowardice
that
i
am
no
longer
master
of
myself
incapable
of
commanding
my
feelings
become
the
slave
and
the
plaything
of
my
shameful
desires
and
of
my
lustful
passions
it
must
have
happened
yes
it
must
have
happened
sooner
or
later
i
was
obliged
to
fall
it
is
the
chastisement
of
my
presumption
and
pride
ah
wretch
you
wish
to
subdue
the
flesh
you
wish
to
reform
nature
you
wish
to
be
wiser
than
god
they
tried
at
the
seminary
by
means
of
and
of
to
quench
in
you
the
desires
of
youth
and
its
rebellious
passion
vain
efforts
senseless
attempts
which
served
only
to
retard
your
fall
in
vain
you
try
in
vain
you
struggle
in
vain
you
invoke
the
angels
and
call
god
to
your
aid
there
comes
a
time
a
moment
a
minute
a
second
in
which
all
your
life
of
struggles
and
efforts
is
lost
the
angry
flesh
subdues
you
in
its
turn
baffled
nature
revolts
and
the
creator
whose
laws
you
have
not
recognized
abandons
the
worthless
creature
and
lets
him
roll
over
falling
into
an
abyss
of
iniquity
oh
my
god
where
is
all
this
going
to
bring
me
what
will
become
of
me
how
can
i
show
my
brow
all
covered
with
shame
is
not
my
infamy
written
there
she
she
what
will
she
think
of
me
to
kiss
her
hand
her
soft
perfumed
hand
oh
god
god
where
am
i
where
am
i
going
i
said
it
martyrdom
or
shame
it
is
shame
which
awaits
me
so
spoke
the
curé
when
marianne
had
taken
away
her
young
mistress
and
his
conscience
exaggerated
the
gravity
and
the
consequences
of
his
imprudent
rapture
yes
it
is
shame
it
is
shame
do
not
despair
in
this
way
said
a
jeering
voice
marcel
turned
round
his
servant
was
behind
him
she
had
approached
noiselessly
and
was
looking
at
him
with
her
strange
green
eyes
shame
lies
in
scandal
she
added
sententiously
reassure
yourself
that
pretty
young
lady
will
hold
her
tongue
she
spoke
low
slowly
with
perfect
calm
and
each
word
penetrated
the
priest
heart
like
a
steel
blade
like
all
persons
ashamed
of
having
been
caught
he
put
himself
in
a
passion
you
he
cried
you
here
who
called
you
you
were
not
gone
to
bed
then
what
do
you
want
what
have
you
just
been
doing
you
are
always
listening
then
at
the
doors
that
is
useful
sometimes
the
woman
said
sententiously
what
you
dare
to
admit
that
wretched
fault
without
blushing
at
it
there
are
many
others
who
ought
to
blush
and
yet
do
blush
what
do
you
mean
come
speak
what
do
you
want
only
to
talk
with
you
you
have
had
a
long
talk
with
mademoiselle
suzanne
durand
you
can
well
listen
to
me
a
little
in
my
turn
what
do
you
say
wicked
creature
what
do
you
say
oh
monsieur
le
curé
you
are
wrong
to
call
me
wicked
i
am
not
so
you
are
at
the
very
least
most
indiscreet
oh
sir
it
is
not
my
fault
it
is
quite
involuntarily
that
i
have
been
a
witness
of
what
passed
eh
what
has
passed
then
sir
do
question
me
she
said
in
a
pitying
tone
have
heard
and
you
have
seen
cried
the
priest
in
a
stifled
voice
what
have
you
seen
then
wretched
woman
and
mad
with
anger
with
blazing
eyes
and
clenched
fists
he
sprang
upon
the
servant
who
was
afraid
and
retreated
to
the
door
please
monsieur
le
curé
she
implored
do
hurt
me
these
words
recalled
the
priest
to
himself
no
he
said
as
he
sat
down
again
no
veronica
i
shall
not
hurt
you
i
flew
into
a
passion
i
was
wrong
pardon
me
reassure
yourself
see
i
am
calm
come
closer
and
let
us
talk
come
closer
sit
here
in
front
of
me
i
will
do
so
ah
you
frighten
me
it
is
your
fault
veronica
why
do
you
put
me
into
such
passion
it
was
not
my
intention
far
from
it
i
wanted
to
talk
with
you
very
peaceably
like
the
it
is
so
nice
please
enough
of
that
subject
oh
monsieur
le
curé
it
is
just
about
that
i
want
to
speak
to
you
do
not
jest
veronica
you
have
been
thanks
to
your
culpable
indiscretion
witness
of
a
momentary
error
which
will
not
be
repeated
any
more
a
momentary
error
which
would
have
led
you
to
some
pretty
things
monsieur
le
curé
good
god
if
marianne
had
not
arrived
in
time
who
knows
what
might
have
happened
it
is
not
for
you
to
blame
me
veronica
there
is
only
god
who
is
without
sin
i
know
that
well
therefore
i
have
not
said
that
to
you
in
order
to
blame
you
quite
the
contrary
i
was
astonished
that
with
a
temperament
as
strong
as
yours
you
have
remained
free
from
fault
till
and
please
god
i
will
always
remain
so
oh
god
does
not
ask
for
impossibilities
as
my
old
master
monsieur
le
curé
fortin
used
to
say
he
was
a
man
he
often
repeated
to
me
you
see
veronica
provided
appearances
are
saved
everything
is
saved
god
is
content
he
asks
for
no
more
what
the
abbé
fortin
said
that
yes
and
many
other
things
too
he
was
so
honest
so
delicate
a
man
not
more
than
you
however
monsieur
le
curé
but
he
understood
his
case
better
than
any
other
he
said
again
beware
of
bad
example
keep
yourself
from
scandal
dirty
linen
should
be
washed
at
home
good
rules
are
they
not
monsieur
marcel
certainly
he
knew
so
well
how
to
compassionate
human
infirmities
ah
when
nature
speaks
she
speaks
very
loudly
do
you
know
anything
about
it
veronica
who
does
not
know
it
i
can
certainly
acknowledge
that
to
you
since
you
are
my
curé
and
my
confessor
that
is
true
veronica
and
to
whom
should
a
poor
servant
acknowledge
her
secret
thoughts
if
not
to
her
curé
and
her
confessor
he
is
her
only
friend
in
this
world
is
he
not
the
curé
did
not
reply
he
considered
the
strange
shape
the
conversation
was
taking
and
cast
a
look
of
defiance
at
the
woman
you
do
not
answer
sir
she
said
you
do
not
look
upon
me
as
your
friend
that
is
wrong
is
it
because
i
have
surprised
your
secrets
i
have
no
secrets
yes
suzanne
enough
on
that
subject
do
not
revive
my
shame
since
you
call
yourself
my
friend
oh
sir
it
is
precisely
for
that
it
is
because
i
do
not
want
you
to
distress
yourself
about
so
little
listen
to
me
sir
i
am
older
than
you
and
although
i
am
not
so
learned
i
have
the
experience
which
as
they
say
is
not
picked
up
in
books
well
this
experience
has
taught
me
many
things
which
perhaps
you
do
not
suspect
explain
yourself
i
would
have
explained
already
if
you
had
wished
it
the
other
evening
you
were
quite
sad
sitting
by
that
fireless
grate
you
were
thinking
of
i
do
know
what
but
certainly
it
was
not
of
anything
very
lively
so
much
so
that
it
went
to
my
heart
i
suspected
what
was
vexing
you
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
but
you
repulsed
me
almost
brutally
nevertheless
if
you
had
listened
to
me
that
day
what
has
just
happened
might
not
have
occurred
i
do
understand
you
i
will
make
myself
understood
if
you
allow
me
xl
little
confessions
to
relate
one
misfortunes
often
alleviates
them
corneille
the
curé
laid
his
forehead
between
his
hands
and
rested
his
elbows
on
his
knees
a
common
attitude
among
confessors
i
am
listening
to
you
he
said
i
said
to
you
monsieur
le
curé
do
not
despair
you
will
excuse
a
poor
servant
boldness
but
it
is
the
friendship
i
have
for
you
which
has
urged
me
nothing
else
believe
me
i
am
an
honest
girl
entirely
devoted
to
my
masters
you
are
the
fourth
monsieur
le
curé
yes
the
fourth
master
well
the
three
others
have
never
had
to
complain
about
me
a
single
moment
for
indiscretion
or
for
idleness
or
for
want
of
attention
or
for
anything
in
fact
for
anything
never
a
harsh
word
you
have
done
well
veronica
that
quite
right
veronica
do
as
you
think
proper
veronica
your
advice
is
excellent
veronica
those
are
all
the
rough
words
which
have
been
said
to
me
monsieur
marcel
therefore
i
repeat
really
it
went
to
my
heart
to
hear
you
speaking
harshly
sometimes
to
me
and
to
see
that
you
did
not
appear
satisfied
with
me
i
had
not
been
accustomed
to
that
and
the
servant
picking
up
the
corner
of
her
apron
burst
into
tears
why
veronica
are
you
mad
why
do
you
cry
so
who
has
made
you
suppose
that
i
was
not
satisfied
with
you
i
may
have
spoken
harshly
to
you
it
is
possible
but
it
was
in
a
moment
of
excitement
or
of
impatience
which
i
regret
you
well
know
that
i
am
not
oh
no
sir
that
is
just
what
grieves
me
you
are
so
kind
to
everybody
you
are
only
severe
to
me
you
are
wrong
again
veronica
i
may
have
felt
hurt
at
your
indiscretion
but
that
is
all
put
yourself
in
my
place
and
you
will
allow
that
it
is
humiliating
for
a
priest
do
not
speak
of
that
again
monsieur
le
curé
you
are
very
wrong
to
disturb
yourself
about
it
and
if
you
had
had
confidence
in
me
before
i
should
have
told
you
that
all
have
acted
like
you
all
have
gone
through
that
all
all
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
young
and
old
have
fallen
into
the
same
fault
if
we
can
call
it
a
fault
as
monsieur
fortin
used
to
say
and
the
old
still
more
than
the
young
after
that
perhaps
you
will
say
to
me
that
it
is
the
place
which
is
wicked
be
silent
veronica
what
you
say
is
very
wrong
for
if
i
perfectly
understand
you
you
are
bringing
an
infamous
accusation
against
my
predecessors
perhaps
you
think
to
palliate
my
fault
thus
in
my
own
eyes
i
thank
you
for
the
intention
but
it
is
an
improper
course
and
the
reproach
which
you
try
to
cast
upon
the
worthy
priests
who
have
succeeded
one
another
in
this
parish
takes
away
none
of
my
remorse
monsieur
fortin
had
not
so
many
scruples
he
was
however
a
most
respectable
man
and
one
who
never
dared
to
look
a
young
girl
in
her
face
he
was
so
bashful
well
he
often
used
to
say
god
has
well
done
all
that
he
has
done
and
he
is
too
wise
to
be
angry
when
we
make
use
of
his
benefits
that
is
rather
an
elastic
morality
it
was
monsieur
fortin
who
taught
me
that
after
all
that
is
perhaps
morality
in
word
you
are
morality
in
deed
veronica
you
are
strangely
misusing
the
rights
which
i
have
allowed
you
to
take
do
not
put
yourself
in
a
rage
monsieur
le
curé
if
i
talk
to
you
so
i
wanted
to
persuade
you
thoroughly
that
you
can
rely
upon
me
in
everything
that
i
can
keep
a
secret
though
you
sometimes
call
me
a
tattler
and
that
i
am
not
after
all
such
a
worthless
girl
as
you
believe
we
like
when
the
moment
has
come
to
get
ourselves
appreciated
to
profit
by
it
to
our
utmost
veronica
said
marcel
i
hardly
know
what
you
want
to
arrive
at
but
i
wish
to
speak
frankly
to
you
since
you
have
behaved
frankly
towards
me
i
recognize
all
the
wisdom
of
your
proceeding
although
you
will
agree
it
has
something
offensive
and
humiliating
for
me
but
after
all
it
is
preferable
that
you
should
come
and
tell
me
this
to
my
face
than
that
you
should
go
and
chatter
in
the
village
and
tattle
without
my
knowledge
oh
monsieur
le
curé
veronica
is
not
capable
of
that
therefore
since
you
have
discovered
discovered
a
secret
which
would
ruin
me
what
do
you
calculate
on
making
from
this
secret
and
what
do
you
demand
i
monsieur
le
curé
cried
the
servant
i
demand
nothing
oh
nothing
you
are
hesitating
yes
you
want
something
come
it
is
you
now
who
hang
your
head
and
blush
while
it
is
i
who
am
the
culprit
come
place
yourself
there
close
to
me
oh
monsieur
le
curé
i
shall
never
presume
presume
then
have
you
not
told
me
that
you
were
my
friend
yes
well
then
place
yourself
there
tell
me
veronica
what
is
your
age
mine
monsieur
le
curé
what
a
question
i
am
not
too
old
come
not
so
old
as
you
think
i
am
forty
forty
why
you
are
still
of
an
age
to
get
married
i
quite
think
so
and
you
have
never
intended
to
do
so
to
get
married
oh
upon
my
word
if
i
had
wanted
to
do
so
i
should
not
have
waited
until
now
i
believe
you
veronica
you
could
have
done
very
well
before
now
but
you
may
have
changed
your
ideas
our
characters
our
tastes
change
with
time
and
a
thing
displeases
us
which
will
please
us
there
are
often
it
is
true
certain
considerations
which
stop
us
and
make
us
reflect
perhaps
you
have
not
a
round
enough
sum
with
a
little
money
at
your
age
you
could
still
make
an
excellent
match
and
even
without
money
monsieur
le
curé
if
i
were
willing
somebody
has
been
pestering
me
for
a
long
time
for
that
and
you
are
not
willing
the
person
doubtless
does
not
suit
you
oh
i
have
my
choice
well
and
good
we
can
not
use
too
much
reflection
upon
a
matter
of
this
importance
i
am
not
rich
veronica
but
i
should
like
to
help
you
and
to
increase
if
it
be
possible
your
little
savings
your
dowry
in
fact
you
are
very
good
sir
but
i
do
not
wish
to
get
married
why
so
it
depends
on
tastes
you
know
you
are
in
a
great
hurry
then
to
get
rid
of
me
monsieur
le
curé
not
at
all
do
not
believe
it
come
come
monsieur
le
curé
i
see
your
intentions
you
say
to
yourself
she
holds
a
secret
which
may
prove
troublesome
to
me
with
a
little
money
i
will
put
a
padlock
on
her
tongue
i
will
get
her
married
and
by
this
means
she
will
trouble
me
no
more
is
it
a
bad
guess
you
have
not
guessed
it
the
least
in
world
veronica
oh
it
is
but
it
is
a
bad
calculation
and
for
two
reasons
in
the
first
place
if
i
marry
your
secret
is
more
in
danger
than
if
i
remain
single
you
know
that
a
woman
ought
not
to
hide
anything
from
her
husband
there
are
certain
things
no
nothing
at
all
no
secret
or
mystery
the
husband
ought
to
see
all
to
know
all
to
be
acquainted
with
all
that
concerns
his
wife
ah
i
know
how
to
live
though
i
am
an
old
maid
you
are
a
pearl
veronica
you
want
to
make
fun
of
me
but
others
have
said
that
to
me
before
you
and
they
were
talking
seriously
on
the
other
hand
she
continued
if
you
keep
me
you
need
not
fear
my
slandering
you
since
i
am
in
your
hands
and
the
day
you
hear
any
rumour
you
can
turn
me
away
your
argument
is
just
and
believe
me
that
my
words
had
but
a
single
object
not
that
of
separating
myself
from
you
but
of
being
useful
to
you
since
you
are
desirous
of
remaining
with
me
at
which
i
am
happy
let
us
therefore
try
to
live
on
good
terms
and
do
you
for
your
part
forget
my
weaknesses
i
for
mine
will
forget
your
inquisitiveness
and
let
us
talk
no
more
about
them
oh
yes
we
will
talk
again
i
consent
to
it
let
us
therefore
make
peace
and
give
me
your
hand
here
it
is
monsieur
le
curé
ah
veronica
humanum
yes
i
know
monsieur
fortin
often
repeated
it
that
means
to
say
that
the
devil
is
sly
and
the
flesh
is
weak
it
is
something
like
that
so
then
i
trust
to
your
honesty
you
can
do
so
without
fear
to
your
discretion
you
can
do
so
with
all
confidence
to
your
friendship
for
me
have
you
really
a
little
veronica
i
have
sir
said
the
servant
affected
you
ask
me
that
what
must
i
then
do
to
convince
you
be
discreet
that
is
all
oh
you
might
require
more
than
that
but
could
i
also
in
my
turn
ask
something
of
you
ask
on
it
will
be
perhaps
very
hard
for
you
speak
freely
what
do
you
want
are
you
not
mistress
here
is
not
everything
at
your
disposal
oh
no
no
you
surprise
me
have
i
hurt
you
without
knowing
it
i
do
not
remember
it
i
assure
you
tell
me
then
that
i
may
atone
for
my
fault
i
hardly
know
how

poor

tales
you

the
curé
of
althausen
had
no
need
of
reflection
to
understand
the
kind
of
shameful
bargain
which
his
servant
had
allowed
him
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
lustful
look
of
the
woman
had
spoken
too
clearly
and
when
he
had
taken
her
hand
he
had
felt
it
burn
and
tremble
in
his
then
certain
circumstances
certain
facts
to
which
he
had
not
attended
at
first
came
back
to
his
memory
two
or
three
times
veronica
on
frivolous
pretexts
had
entered
his
bedroom
at
night
and
each
time
he
remembered
well
she
was
in
somewhat
indecent
undress
which
contrasted
strangely
with
her
ordinarily
severe
appearance
he
recalled
to
himself
all
the
stories
of
curés
servants
who
shared
their
masters
bed
stories
told
in
a
whisper
at
certain
when
the
priests
of
the
district
met
together
at
the
senior
house
to
observe
the
feast
of
some
saint
or
other
the
great
saint
priapus
perhaps
and
where
lively
talk
and
sprightly
stories
ran
merrily
round
the
table
and
what
he
had
taken
for
jokes
in
bad
taste
and
refused
to
believe
till
now
he
began
to
understand
for
he
could
no
longer
doubt
that
he
had
set
his
servant
passions
aflame
and
he
must
either
expose
himself
to
her
venomous
tongue
and
incur
the
shame
and
scandal
or
else
appease
the
erotic
rage
of
this
kitchen
messalina
he
tried
to
drive
away
this
horrible
thought
to
believe
that
he
had
been
mistaken
to
persuade
himself
that
he
was
the
dope
of
erroneous
appearances
he
wished
to
convince
himself
that
he
had
been
the
victim
of
errors
engendered
by
his
own
depravity
that
he
judged
according
to
his
secret
sentiments
his
efforts
were
vain
the
woman
feverish
eyes
her
restless
solicitude
her
jealous
rage
her
incessant
watching
the
evidence
in
short
was
there
which
contradicted
all
his
hopes
to
the
contrary
and
then
the
latest
confessions
regarding
his
predecessors
all
have
acted
like
you
all
possessed
his
mind
like
him
what
had
they
done
they
also
had
attempted
then
to
seduce
young
girls
and
perhaps
had
consummated
their
infernal
design
what
respectable
priests
ministers
of
the
gospel
pastors
of
god
flock
was
it
possible
but
was
not
he
a
respectable
priest
and
respected
by
all
a
minister
of
god
a
leader
of
the
holy
flock
a
pastor
of
men
and
yet
how
then
where
is
virtue
virtue
answered
that
voice
which
we
have
within
ourselves
that
voice
odious
to
hypocrites
and
deceivers
which
the
church
calls
the
voice
and
which
is
the
voice
of
reason
virtue
of
which
do
you
speak
fool
without
counting
the
there
are
fifty
thousand
kinds
of
virtues
it
is
like
happiness
institutions
reputations
religions
morals
principles
truth
on
this
side
the
mount
error
on
that
there
are
as
many
kinds
of
virtues
as
there
are
different
peoples
history
swarms
with
virtuous
people
who
have
been
so
in
their
own
way
socrates
was
virtuous
and
yet
what
strange
familiarities
he
allowed
himself
with
the
young
alcibiades
the
virtuous
brutus
virtuously
assassinated
his
father
the
virtuous
elizabeth
of
hungary
had
herself
whipped
by
her
confessor
the
virtuous
conrad
and
the
virtuous
janicot
doted
on
virtuous
little
boys
and
finally
monseigneur
is
virtuous
but
his
old
lady
friends
look
down
and
smile
when
he
talks
of
virtue
see
this
priest
of
austere
countenance
and
whitened
hair
he
too
during
long
years
has
believed
in
that
virtue
which
forms
his
torment
candid
and
trustful
he
felt
the
fervency
of
religion
fill
his
heart
from
his
youth
he
had
faith
he
was
filled
with
the
spirit
of
charity
and
love
he
said
like
the
apostle
charitas
et
amor
deus
ibi
and
he
believed
that
god
was
with
him
and
that
alone
with
god
he
was
peacefully
pursuing
his
road
but
he
had
counted
without
that
troublesome
guest
who
comes
and
places
himself
as
a
third
between
the
creature
and
the
creator
and
who
more
powerful
than
the
god
of
legend
quickly
banishes
him
for
he
is
the
principle
of
life
and
the
other
is
the
principle
of
death
it
is
the
fruitful
love
and
the
other
is
the
wasting
barren
love
it
is
present
and
active
while
the
other
is
inert
dumb
and
in
the
clouds
of
your
sickly
brain
it
is
in
vain
that
in
his
successive
halts
from
parish
to
parish
he
has
resisted
the
thousand
seductions
which
surround
the
priest
from
the
timid
gaze
of
the
simple
smitten
with
a
holy
love
for
the
young
curate
to
the
veiled
smile
of
the
languishing
woman
in
vain
will
he
attempt
like
fénélon
formerly
to
put
the
warmth
of
his
heart
and
the
incitements
of
the
flesh
upon
the
wrong
scent
by
carrying
on
a
platonic
love
with
some
chosen
souls
what
is
the
result
in
the
end
of
his
efforts
and
his
struggles
now
he
is
old
ought
he
not
to
be
appeased
no
weighty
and
imperious
matter
has
regained
the
upper
hand
he
loves
no
longer
he
is
not
able
to
love
any
longer
but
the
fury
urges
him
on
he
seduces
his
cook
or
dishonours
his
niece
and
yet
those
most
courageous
natures
exist
for
they
have
resisted
to
the
end
we
blame
them
we
are
wrong
who
would
have
been
capable
of
such
efforts
and
sacrifices
who
would
sustain
during
ten
fifteen
twenty
years
similar
straggles
between
the
imperious
requirements
of
nature
and
the
miserable
duties
of
convention
they
therefore
who
see
their
hair
fall
before
their
virtue
are
very
rare
the
crowd
of
priests
strike
themselves
against
the
obstacles
of
the
road
from
the
first
steps
they
tear
their
catechumen
robe
with
the
white
thorns
of
may
and
when
they
have
arrived
at
the
end
of
their
career
they
have
stopped
many
a
time
under
some
mysterious
thicket
unknown
by
the
vulgar
relishing
the
forbidden
fruit
let
us
leave
them
in
peace
it
is
not
i
who
will
disturb
their
sweet
xlii
memory
looking
back

can
do
nothing
against

which
must
arrive

léon
cladel
de
la
marcel
was
one
of
those
energetic
natures
who
believe
that
struggle
is
one
of
the
conditions
of
life
he
had
valiantly
accepted
the
task
which
was
incumbent
upon
him
but
there
are
hours
of
discouragement
and
exhaustion
in
which
the
boldest
and
the
strongest
succumb
and
he
had
reached
one
of
those
hours
and
then
it
is
so
difficult
to
struggle
without
ceasing
especially
when
we
catch
no
glimpse
of
calmer
days
weariness
quickly
comes
and
we
sink
down
on
the
road
then
a
friendly
hand
should
be
stretched
towards
us
should
lift
us
up
and
say
to
us
courage
but
marcel
could
not
lean
on
any
friendly
hand
he
had
no
one
to
whom
he
could
confide
his
struggles
his
vexations
and
the
apprehension
of
his
coming
weaknesses
although
his
life
as
priest
had
been
spotless
up
to
then
his
brethren
held
aloof
from
him
for
there
was
a
bad
mark
against
him
at
the
palace
it
had
been
attached
at
the
commencement
of
his
career
he
was
one
of
those
catechumens
on
whom
from
the
very
first
the
most
brilliant
hopes
are
founded
knowledge
intelligence
respectful
obedience
appearance
of
piety
sympathetic
face
everything
was
present
in
him
the
bishop
a
frivolous
old
man
a
great
lover
of
little
girls
who
combined
the
sinecure
of
his
bishopric
with
that
of
almoner
to
a
empress
whose
name
will
remain
celebrated
in
the
annals
of
devout
gallantry
or
of
gallant
devotion
the
bishop
a
worthy
pastor
for
such
a
sheep
passed
the
greater
portion
of
his
time
in
the
intrigues
of
petticoats
and
sacristies
and
left
to
the
young
secretary
the
care
of
matters
spiritual
it
was
he
who
like
composed
the
mandates
and
sometimes
the
sermons
of
monseigneur
this
confidence
did
not
fail
to
arouse
secret
storms
in
the
episcopal
a
jealous
of
the
influence
which
the
young
abbé
was
assuming
over
his
master
mind
had
resolved
upon
his
dismissal
and
fall
with
a
tortuous
diplomacy
he
pried
into
the
young
heart
as
yet
fresh
and
inexperienced
he
insinuated
himself
into
the
most
hidden
recesses
of
his
conscience
seized
so
to
say
in
their
flight
the
timid
fleeting
transports
of
his
thought
of
his
vigorous
imagination
and
soon
discovered
with
secret
satisfaction
that
he
was
straying
from
the
ancient
path
of
orthodoxy
marcel
indeed
belonged
to
that
younger
generation
of
the
clergy
which
believes
that
everything
which
alienates
the
church
from
new
ideas
brings
it
nearer
to
its
ruin
and
the
day
when
the
foolish
pius
ix
presumed
to
proclaim
and
define
to
the
great
joy
of
and
the
enemies
of
catholicism
the
ridiculous
dogma
of
the
immaculate
conception
in
the
presence
of
two
hundred
dumb
complaisant
prelates
on
that
day
he
experienced
profound
grief
according
to
his
ideas
this
was
the
severest
blow
which
had
been
inflicted
on
the
foundations
of
the
church
for
centuries
he
had
studied
theology
deeply
but
he
had
not
confined
himself
to
the
letter
he
believed
he
saw
something
beyond
the
letter
killeth
he
said
the
spirit
giveth
life
the
spirit
giveth
life
when
it
is
wholesome
and
pure
the
answered
him
with
a
smile
but
is
it
healthy
in
a
young
man
who
believes
himself
to
be
wiser
than
his
elders
marcel
then
without
mistrust
and
urged
by
questions
developed
his
theories
he
believed
in
the
absolute
equality
of
men
before
god
in
the
transmutation
of
souls
and
the
resurrection
of
the
flesh
seemed
to
him
the
utmost
absurdity
he
quite
thought
that
there
were
future
rewards
and
penalties
but
he
had
too
much
faith
in
the
goodness
of
god
to
suppose
that
the
expiation
could
be
eternal
he
allied
himself
in
that
to
the
universalists
who
were
he
said
the
most
reasonable
sect
of
american
protestantism
reasonable
reasonable
repeated
the
scoffingly
in
truth
my
poor
friend
you
make
me
doubt
your
reason
can
there
be
anything
reasonable
in
the
turpitude
of
heresy
then
he
hurried
to
find
the
bishop
i
have
emptied
our
young
man
bag
he
said
to
him
do
you
know
monseigneur
what
there
was
at
the
bottom
oh
oh
has
he
been
inclined
to
debauchery
he
is
so
young
would
to
heaven
it
were
only
that
monseigneur
but
it
is
a
hundred
times
worse
what
do
you
tell
me
must
i
fear
then
for
all
my
little
sheep
we
must
look
after
him
then
i
repeat
monseigneur
that
that
would
be
nothing
it
is
the
abomination
of
abomination
a
whole
world
of
turpitude
heresies
in
embryo
heresies
oh
oh
that
is
serious
heresies
which
would
make
the
cursed
shades
of
john
huss
wickliffe
luther
and
calvin
himself
tremble
if
they
appeared
again
what
do
you
say
i
tell
you
monseigneur
that
you
have
warmed
a
viper
in
your
bosom
ah
well
i
will
drive
out
this
wicked
viper
the
bishop
who
kept
two
nieces
in
the
episcopal
seraglio
would
willingly
have
pardoned
his
secretary
if
he
had
been
accused
of
immorality
but
he
could
not
carry
his
condescension
so
far
as
heresy
he
wanted
however
to
assure
himself
personally
and
as
marcel
was
incapable
of
lying
he
quickly
recognized
the
sad
reality
the
young
abbé
was
severely
punished
he
was
compelled
to
make
an
apology
to
retract
his
horrible
ideas
to
stifle
the
germ
of
these
infant
monstrosities
then
he
was
condemned
to
spend
six
months
in
one
of
those
ecclesiastical
prisons
called
of
where
the
guilty
priest
is
exposed
to
every
torment
and
every
vexation
he
was
definitely
marked
and
classed
as
a
dangerous
individual
his
enemy
the
pursued
him
with
his
indefatigable
hatred
so
far
that
from
disgrace
to
disgrace
he
had
reached
the
cure
of
althausen
xliii
espionage
a
sunbeam
had
traversed
his
heart
it
had
just
disappeared
ernest
daudet
duperies
de
since
the
fatal
evening
when
the
secret
of
his
love
had
been
discovered
by
his
servant
marcel
had
observed
the
woman
on
his
steps
watching
his
slightest
proceedings
scrutinizing
his
most
innocent
gestures
he
encountered
everywhere
her
keen
inquisitive
look
he
wished
at
first
to
meet
it
with
the
greatest
circumspection
and
the
most
absolute
reserve
he
avoided
all
conversation
which
he
thought
might
lead
him
into
the
way
of
fresh
confidences
and
he
affected
an
icy
coldness
but
he
was
soon
obliged
to
renounce
this
means
the
woman
irritated
suddenly
became
sullen
and
angry
and
made
the
curé
pay
dear
for
the
reserve
which
he
imposed
on
himself
the
dinner
was
burnt
the
soup
tasted
only
of
warm
water
his
bed
was
hard
his
socks
were
full
of
holes
his
shoes
badly
cleaned
finally
he
was
several
times
awakened
with
a
start
by
terrible
noises
during
the
night
he
attempted
a
few
remonstrances
veronica
replied
with
sharpness
and
threatened
to
leave
him
you
can
look
for
another
maid
she
said
to
him
as
for
me
i
have
had
enough
of
it
oh
you
old
hussy
he
thought
i
would
soon
pack
you
off
to
the
devil
if
i
were
not
afraid
of
your
cursed
tongue
then
for
the
sake
of
peace
he
changed
his
tactics
he
was
affable
and
smiling
and
spoke
to
her
gently
and
the
servant
manners
changed
directly
she
also
became
like
she
had
been
before
attentive
and
submissive
several
days
passed
thus
in
a
continual
constraint
and
hidden
anger
at
the
same
time
a
restlessness
consumed
him
which
he
used
all
his
power
to
conceal
he
had
not
seen
suzanne
again
either
at
the
morning
masses
or
in
her
usual
walks
he
looked
forward
to
sunday
but
at
high
mass
her
place
remained
empty
he
reckoned
on
vespers
vespers
and
then
compline
passed
without
her
in
vain
he
searched
the
nave
and
the
galleries
his
sorrowing
gaze
did
not
find
suzanne
and
he
chanted
the
pueri
with
the
voice
of
the
where
was
she
he
had
no
other
thought
her
father
had
prevented
her
from
coming
to
church
without
any
doubt
but
why
had
he
not
seen
her
as
before
upon
the
roads
which
they
both
liked
he
made
a
thousand
conjectures
and
with
his
thoughts
completely
absorbed
in
suzanne
he
forgot
aught
else
he
saw
no
longer
those
attractive
members
of
his
congregation
who
admired
him
in
secret
as
they
accompanied
him
with
their
fresh
voices
and
were
astonished
at
the
mysterious
trouble
which
agitated
their
sweet
pastor
he
forgot
even
the
odious
spy
who
watched
him
in
some
corner
of
the
church
and
whom
he
would
meet
again
at
his
house
ashamed
of
himself
he
recalled
with
a
blush
the
hand
he
had
kissed
in
a
moment
of
frenzy
which
must
have
let
suzanne
suspect
what
was
the
plague
which
consumed
his
heart
and
he
would
have
sacrificed
ten
years
of
his
life
to
become
again
what
he
was
in
the
eyes
of
this
young
girl
hardly
a
month
ago
only
a
stranger
unaccustomed
to
the
world
he
did
not
yet
know
women
well
enough
to
be
aware
that
they
are
full
of
indulgence
for
follies
committed
for
their
sake
and
more
ready
to
excuse
an
insult
than
to
pardon
indifference
under
these
circumstances
vanity
takes
the
place
of
courage
and
gives
to
the
commonest
girl
the
instincts
of
a
patrician
there
is
no
woman
but
wishes
to
see
the
world
at
her
feet
and
the
espionage
which
laid
so
heavy
on
him
became
every
day
more
irritating
and
more
insupportable
in
vain
he
fled
from
the
house
and
walked
on
straight
before
him
far
very
far
as
far
as
possible
he
felt
his
servant
gaze
following
him
and
weighing
upon
him
with
all
the
burden
of
her
furious
and
jealousy
he
felt
that
lynx
eye
pierce
the
walls
and
watch
him
everywhere
even
when
he
had
put
between
himself
and
the
parsonage
the
streets
the
gardens
the
width
of
the
village
and
the
depth
of
the
woods
she
received
him
on
his
return
with
a
smile
on
her
lips
but
her
eager
eye
searched
him
from
head
to
foot
studied
his
looks
his
gestures
the
folds
of
his
cassock
and
even
the
dust
on
his
shoes
as
though
she
wished
to
strip
him
and
bare
his
heart
in
order
to
feast
upon
his
secret
conflicts

other
days
passed
and
then
others
from
a
in
the
loft
of
the
parsonage
the
eye
commanded
a
view
of
the
whole
village
over
the
roofs
could
be
seen
the
house
of
captain
durand
quite
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
marcel
went
up
there
several
times
and
with
his
gaze
fixed
on
that
white
wall
which
concealed
the
sweet
object
which
had
torn
from
him
his
tranquillity
and
his
peaceful
toil
he
forgot
himself
and
was
lost
in
his
thoughts
then
his
eyes
wandered
over
the
verdant
plain
and
the
length
of
the
stream
edged
with
willows
which
wound
along
as
far
as
the
wood
side
by
side
with
the
little
path
where
often
he
had
met
with
suzanne
sometimes
the
keen
april
wind
blew
violently
through
the
timber
and
the
cracks
of
the
roofing
it
shook
the
joists
and
filled
the
loft
with
that
shrill
sinister
sound
which
is
like
an
echo
of
the
lamentable
complaint
of
the
dead
and
it
appeared
to
him
that
these
groanings
of
the
tempest
mingled
with
the
groanings
of
his
soul
but
he
soon
discovered
that
the
was
also
a
post
of
observation
for
veronica
for
to
their
mutual
embarrassment
they
caught
one
another
climbing
cautiously
up
the
wooden
or
slipping
under
the
dusty
joists
again
he
was
caught
in
fault
what
business
had
he
in
that
loft
he
resumed
his
walks
and
prolonged
them
as
much
as
possible
he
resumed
his
pastoral
visits
with
a
zeal
which
charmed
the
feminine
portion
of
his
flock
but
nowhere
did
he
see
or
hear
anything
of
suzanne
that
name
filled
his
heart
and
he
dreaded
the
least
suspicion
the
slightest
comment
he
was
seen
always
abroad
he
fled
from
his
house
his
books
his
flowers
that
little
home
which
he
loved
so
well
when
it
was
quiet
and
where
now
he
heard
the
muttering
storms
he
suspected
some
infernal
plot
and
the
remembrance
of
that
hand
which
was
surrendered
to
him
and
on
which
he
had
placed
his
lips
that
remembrance
consumed
his
heart
he
saw
again
suzanne
emotion
her
large
dark
eyes
full
of
amazement
yet
without
anger
and
he
would
have
wished
to
see
them
again
were
it
only
for
a
second
in
order
to
read
in
them
the
impression
which
his
presence
left
there
xlv
treacherous
manoeuvre
he
stepped
more
lightly
than
a
bird
love
traced
out
his
progress
champfleury
comédie
i
must
know
he
said
to
himself
where
i
stand
and
one
morning
after
saying
mass
he
went
out
of
the
village
he
took
the
opposite
direction
to
the
part
where
captain
durand
dwelt
but
after
following
the
high
road
for
some
time
sure
that
he
was
not
being
watched
he
retraced
his
steps
quickly
entered
the
little
path
hedged
with
quicksets
which
runs
by
the
side
of
the
gardens
and
rapidly
made
the
circuit
of
althausen
hitherto
in
his
walks
he
had
avoided
from
shame
as
much
as
from
fear
the
captain
house
now
he
directed
his
steps
thither
with
head
erect
resolute
and
assuming
a
careless
air
as
if
the
peasants
whom
he
met
could
suspect
his
secret
agitation
he
hurried
his
steps
desirous
of
settling
the
question
one
way
or
the
other
to
discover
suzanne
that
was
his
only
desire
and
his
heart
beat
as
though
it
would
break
in
spite
of
the
reproaches
and
invectives
which
he
addressed
and
the
fine
argument
which
he
formed
for
himself
he
had
fallen
again
more
than
ever
under
the
yoke
precisely
because
he
saw
obstacles
accumulating
love
had
taken
absolute
possession
of
his
heart
it
had
hollowed
out
its
nest
therein
like
the
viper
in
the
old
norway
ballads
and
while
ever
increasing
consumed
it
to
see
suzanne
simply
the
hem
of
her
gown
or
her
pretty
spring
hat
crowned
with
bluebirds
to
pass
near
the
spot
where
she
breathed
and
to
inhale
there
some
emanation
from
her
was
his
promised
treat
and
he
walked
along
joyously
his
step
was
light
and
he
no
longer
felt
the
load
of
his
grief
his
apprehensions
and
anxiety
disappeared
and
he
was
filled
with
a
wild
hope
a
few
steps
more
and
he
would
see
behind
the
clump
of
old
chestnuts
the
little
house
always
so
smart
and
white
ah
he
knew
it
well
many
a
time
he
had
passed
in
front
of
it
and
behind
it
pensive
and
indifferent
without
dreaming
that
the
sanctuary
of
a
goddess
was
there
the
only
one
henceforth
whom
his
heart
could
adore
there
was
a
little
garden
surrounded
with
palings
with
two
paths
which
crossed
and
placed
in
the
middle
a
statue
of
the
little
corporal
in
a
bed
of
in
one
corner
an
arbour
of
honeysuckle
where
more
than
once
he
had
caught
sight
of
a
crabbed
face
perhaps
the
maid
with
the
sweet
eyes
will
be
sitting
beneath
that
arbour
embroidering
thoughtfully
some
chosen
pattern
what
shall
he
do
if
suzanne
is
there
will
he
dare
to
look
at
her
yes
he
must
he
must
read
the
expression
in
her
look
and
if
that
look
is
sweet
and
free
from
anger
shall
he
stop
certainly
why
should
he
hesitate
what
is
there
surprising
in
a
priest
stopping
to
talk
to
a
young
girl
is
he
not
her
curé
more
than
that
her
confessor
her
confessor
has
he
still
the
right
to
call
himself
so
and
the
soldier
the
disciple
of
voltaire
the
malevolent
unmannerly
father
come
another
blunder
he
sees
clearly
that
he
can
not
dream
of
stopping
and
then
after
what
he
has
done
what
would
he
dare
to
say
he
will
pass
by
therefore
rapidly
without
even
turning
his
head
she
will
see
him
and
that
is
enough
he
quickens
his
step
then
he
slackens
it
where
will
she
be
here
are
the
old
and
behind
is
the
white
house
the
corner
of
paradise
what
is
that
open
window
garnished
with
flowers
that
room
hung
with
rose
and
at
the
back
those
white
curtains
which
the
morning
sun
is
gilding
oh
that
he
might
melt
into
those
subtle
rays
and
penetrate
like
a
ray
of
love
into
that
chaste
virgin
conch
now
he
is
near
the
garden
his
heart
is
beating
he
looks
a
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
path
and
the
rustling
of
a
dress
make
him
start
is
it
she
he
turns
round

behind
him

she
was
red
and
out
of
breath
and
her
large
breasts
rose
and
fell
like
the
bellows
of
a
forge
while
her
air
of
triumph
said
clearly
to
marcel
ah
ah
i
have
caught
you
here
come
monsieur
le
curé
it
is
quite
a
that
i
have
been
looking
for
you
i
ought
to
have
thought
before
where
to
find
you
somebody
is
waiting
for
you
who
but
the
servant
avoided
making
any
reply
as
she
took
the
lead
towards
home
the
curé
followed
her
hanging
his
head
he
reached
the
parsonage
directly
after
her
who
is
waiting
for
me
then
he
said
again
it
the
postman
she
replied
with
an
air
of
frankness
he
could
not
wait
till
he
had
a
letter
for
you
for
only
she
added
lingering
over
these
words
with
a
scornful
smile
marcel
blushed
another
mystery
veronica
went
on
ah
jesus
my
god
what
a
lot
of
mysteries
there
are
here
really
it
worse
than
the
catechism
your
letters
for
you
only
is
that
enough
to
humiliate
me
you
have
reason
then
to
complain
of
my
discretion
that
you
tell
the
postman
to
hand
your
letters
to
holy
virgin
it
a
pretty
thing
what
can
they
think
of
me
then
at
the
they
will
surely
say
that
i
read
your
letters
before
you
do
upon
my
word
your
letters
do
matter
to
me
would
they
not
say
ah
lord
jesus
to
make
a
poor
servant
suffer
martyrdom
in
this
way
there
you
are
with
your
recrimination
again
monsieur
le
curé
i
make
no
recriminations
i
complain
that
is
all
i
certainly
have
the
right
to
complain
my
other
masters
never
acted
in
that
way
with
me
your
masters
acted
as
they
thought
proper
and
i
also
do
as
i
wish
i
see
very
well
that
you
do
ask
advice
from
anyone
and
with
the
insolence
of
a
servant
who
has
got
on
a
footing
with
her
master
she
added
you
have
gone
again
to
the
part
where
durand
lives
after
what
has
happened
are
you
not
afraid
of
compromising
yourself
mind
your
own
business
you
silly
woman
and
leave
me
alone
for
once
i
consider
you
are
very
impudent
in
trying
to
scrutinize
my
actions
my
business
well
monsieur
le
curé
yours
is
mine
just
a
bit
since
i
am
your
confidante
as
to
being
impudent
i
shall
never
be
so
much
as
others
i
know
insolent
woman
ah
you
can
insult
me
monsieur
le
curé
i
let
you
do
as
you
like
with
me
veronica
said
marcel
this
life
is
unendurable
i
hate
to
be
surrounded
with
incessant
spying
what
do
you
want
to
arrive
at
tell
me
what
do
you
want
to
arrive
at
and
the
curé
approached
her
his
fists
clenched
and
with
glaring
eyes
take
care
of
yourself
woman
for
i
am
beginning
to
get
tired
i
am
so
too
i
am
tired
cried
veronica
marcel
wrath
passed
all
bounds
yes
i
understand
you
ought
indeed
to
be
so
tired
of
odious
spying
tired
of
your
unwholesome
curiosity
tired
of
your
useless
do
not
drive
me
too
far
for
your
own
sake
i
warn
you
twice
already
you
have
made
me
beside
myself
beware
you
miserable
woman
beware
of
doing
it
a
third
time
be
quiet
monsieur
le
curé
said
veronica
softly
be
quiet
oh
you
are
driving
me
mad
cried
marcel
throwing
himself
into
an
and
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
the
servant
came
near
him
it
is
you
who
are
making
me
ill
with
your
fits
of
anger
she
said
with
solicitude
shall
i
make
you
a
little
tea
i
do
want
anything
come
monsieur
marcel
be
yourself
i
am
not
what
you
think
no
i
am
not
it
is
my
wish
that
you
leave
me
veronica
everything
i
do
is
for
your
interest
monsieur
le
curé
you
will
understand
it
one
day
leave
me
i
say
the
servant
withdrew
it
can
not
last
thus
he
thought
what
a
scandalous
scene
and
what
a
horrible
fatality
thrusts
me
into
this
ridiculous
and
miserable
situation
ah
the
apostle
is
right
as
soon
as
we
leave
the
straight
path
we
fall
into
the
abyss
and
i
am
in
the
abyss
for
i
am
the
of
this
servant
what
will
become
of
me
with
this
creature
how
can
i
get
rid
of
her
can
i
turn
her
out
she
would
proclaim
everywhere
what
she
has
discovered
ah
if
it
were
only
a
question
of
myself
alone
what
a
dilemma
i
am
involved
in
but
that
letter
that
letter
suzanne
dear
suzanne
no
doubt
it
is
she
who
has
written
to
me
my
heart
tells
me
so
loudly
he
waited
with
feverish
impatience
for
the
postman
return
expecting
news
from
suzanne
and
fearing
with
good
reason
his
inquisitiveness
he
had
indeed
asked
him
for
the
future
to
deliver
his
letters
to
himself
only
he
sought
for
various
pretexts
to
send
veronica
away
but
the
woman
too
discovered
excellent
reasons
for
not
going
out
she
was
present
therefore
in
spite
of
her
master
at
the
delivery
of
the
mysterious
letter
marcel

at
first
displayed

which
enfolds
me
and
was
about
to
hurry
me
on
to
my
ruin
god
be
blessed
and
he
turned
joyfully
to
his
servant
who
was
watching
him
good
news
veronica
i
congratulate
you
sir
she
said
perplexed
and
disturbed
are
you
nominated
to
a
better
cure
does
monseigneur
give
notice
of
his
visit
better
than
that
veronica
my
excellent
and
worthy
uncle
the
abbé
ridoux
gives
notice
of
his
monsieur
le
curé
of
saint
nicholas
himself
do
you
know
him
certainly
he
came
one
day
to
see
monsieur
fortin
may
god
keep
his
soul
regarding
a
collection
for
his
church
ah
he
has
a
fine
church
it
appears
and
a
famous
saint
is
buried
there
my
poor
defunct
master
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
that
there
was
not
a
more
agreeable
man
anywhere
in
the
world
and
i
easily
credited
it
for
he
was
always
in
a
good
temper
he
then
who
has
written
to
you
well
if
he
comes
here
it
will
make
a
little
diversion
for
we
do
often
laugh
that
is
wrong
veronica
a
gentle
gaiety
ought
to
prevail
in
the
house
gaiety
is
the
mark
of
a
pure
heart
and
a
quiet
conscience
where
there
is
hatred
and
division
there
is
more
room
for
the
spirit
of
darkness
our
saviour
has
said
every
house
divided
against
itself
shall
perish
he
has
said
so
yes
monsieur
le
curé
we
must
not
perish
veronica
i
have
no
wish
to
do
so
therefore
i
do
not
cause
the
war
listen
veronica
it
would
be
lamentable
and
scandalous
that
my
uncle
might
possibly
be
troubled
on
his
arrival
here
by
our
little
domestic
differences
and
particularly
that
he
might
suspect
the
nature
of
them
we
are
both
of
us
a
little
in
the
wrong
by
our
each
ascribing
it
to
oneself
it
will
be
easy
for
us
to
come
to
an
understanding
will
it
not
veronica
oh
monsieur
le
curé
we
can
come
to
an
understanding
directly
if
you
wish
it
god
says
that
we
must
forgive
and
i
have
no
malice
then
it
is
agreed
we
will
talk
of
our
little
mutual
complaints
after
supper
i
ask
for
nothing
better
i
am
quite
at
your
service
and
we
will
celebrate
the
good
news
i
will
take
my
share
in
the
celebration
ah
monsieur
le
curé
you
do
not
know
me
yet
i
hope
that
you
will
know
me
better
and
you
will
see
that
i
am
not
an
girl
my
heart
is
as
young
as
another
and
when
we
must
laugh
provided
that
it
is
decent
and
without
offence
i
know
how
to
laugh
and
do
not
give
up
my
share
good
said
marcel
to
himself
let
me
flatter
this
woman
that
is
the
only
way
of
preventing
any
rumour
i
must
leave
althausen
i
will
pass
her
on
to
my
successor
but
i
do
not
want
to
have
an
enemy
behind
me
if
you
have
my
secret
you
old
hypocrite
i
will
have
yours
and
i
will
know
what
there
is
at
the
bottom
of
your
bag
of
iniquity
xlix
confidences
to
thee
i
wish
to
confide
this
secret
speak
of
it
to
we
must
be
discreet
they
love
too
much
to
laugh
in
this
unbelieving
age
babillot
mascarade
that
evening
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
the
curé
of
althausen
had
coffee
served
after
dinner
and
told
his
servant
to
lay
two
cups
you
have
asked
somebody
then
she
enquired
yes
replied
marcel
i
ask
you
veronica
the
woman
smiled
she
went
and
assured
herself
that
the
door
below
was
shut
and
that
the
shutters
were
quite
closed
put
together
a
bundle
of
wood
which
she
placed
partly
on
the
hearth
and
without
further
invitation
sat
down
facing
her
master
we
are
at
home
and
inquisitive
people
will
not
trouble
us
marcel
was
offended
at
thus
being
placed
on
a
footing
of
equality
with
his
servant
nevertheless
he
did
not
allow
it
to
be
seen
it
is
my
fault
he
thought
and
he
answered
quietly
we
have
no
reason
to
dread
inquisitive
persons
we
are
not
going
to
do
anything
wrong
ah
jesus
no
but
you
know
if
they
saw
your
servant
sitting
at
your
table
they
would
not
wait
to
look
for
the
why
and
wherefore
they
would
begin
to
chatter
it
is
true
and
one
likes
to
be
at
home
when
one
has
anything
to
say
is
it
not
so
monsieur
le
curé
marcel
bent
his
head
you
are
a
girl
of
sense
and
that
is
why
i
can
behave
to
you
as
one
can
not
usually
with
a
common
housekeeper
i
am
sure
that
you
understand
me
then
after
a
moment
hesitation
twice
already
i
have
flown
into
a
passion
with
you
veronica
it
is
a
serious
fault
and
i
hope
you
will
consent
to
forgive
it
do
not
speak
of
that
monsieur
le
curé
i
deserved
everything
that
you
have
said
to
me
it
is
for
me
to
ask
your
pardon
for
not
behaving
properly
towards
you
i
acknowledge
all
that
you
do
in
my
interest
i
know
how
to
appreciate
all
your
good
qualities
so
i
pardon
you
freely
monsieur
le
curé
is
too
good
no
i
am
not
too
good
for
if
i
were
so
i
should
have
behaved
differently
towards
you
but
you
know
there
is
always
a
little
germ
of
ingratitude
at
the
bottom
of
a
man
heart
after
all
i
have
considered
and
i
believe
that
with
a
little
good
will
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
we
can
come
to
an
understanding
yes
i
am
easy
to
accommodate
let
us
save
appearances
that
is
essential
you
are
talking
to
me
like
monsieur
fortin
that
suits
me
no
one
could
ever
reproach
me
for
setting
a
bad
example
i
know
it
veronica
your
behaviour
is
full
of
decency
and
dignity
it
is
well
for
the
outside
world
and
as
monsieur
fortin
used
to
say
to
you
we
must
wash
our
dirty
linen
at
home
poor
monsieur
fortin
that
is
what
we
will
do
henceforth
come
veronica
i
have
made
all
my
disclosures
to
you
or
very
nearly
i
have
confessed
to
you
my
errors
and
you
know
some
of
my
faults
as
well
as
i
do
will
you
not
make
your
little
confession
to
me
in
your
turn
you
have
finished
your
coffee
take
a
little
brandy
there
now
sit
close
to
me
monsieur
le
curé
one
only
confesses
on
one
knees
at
the
confessional
before
the
priest
yes
but
it
is
not
thus
that
i
mean
it
is
not
by
right
of
this
that
i
wish
to
know
your
little
secrets
but
by
right
of
a
friend
i
am
quite
confused
monsieur
le
curé
there
is
no
curé
here
there
is
a
friend
a
brother
anything
you
wish
but
not
a
priest
are
you
willing
i
am
quite
willing
you
were
talking
to
me
lately
about
my
predecessors
and
according
to
you
their
conduct
was
not
irreproachable
what
is
there
then
to
say
regarding
them
oh
do
blush
answer
me
what
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
they
committed
faults
then
i
have
told
you
so
sir
sometimes
like
you
ah
veronica
the
greatest
saint
is
he
who
sins
only
seven
times
a
day
seven
times
seven
times
quite
as
much
you
find
no
doubt
that
i
sin
much
more
but
i
am
far
from
being
a
saint
as
to
my
predecessors
were
they
no
greater
saints
saints
ah
jesus
do
you
wish
me
to
tell
you
sir
well
between
ourselves
i
believe
that
there
are
none
but
in
the
calendar
oh
veronica
veronica
yes
sir
i
believe
it
in
my
soul
and
conscience
and
i
can
add
another
thing
still
if
before
they
canonized
all
these
saints
they
had
consulted
their
servant
perhaps
they
would
not
have
found
a
single
one
of
them
what
you
the
pious
veronica
you
say
such
things
one
is
pious
and
staid
and
everything
you
wish
but
one
sees
what
one
sees
monsieur
fortin
was
accustomed
to
say
that
no
one
is
a
great
man
to
his
de
and
i
add
that
no
one
is
a
saint
to
his
cook
i
tell
you
so
but
that
is
blasphemy
veronica
blasphemy
possibly
but
it
is
the
truth
monsieur
marcel
have
you
then
surprised
my
predecessors
in
some
act
of
culpable
weakness
oh
holy
virgin
i
did
not
surprise
them
it
was
they
on
the
contrary
who
surprised
me
you
and
how
then
monsieur
le
curé
you
do
understand
me
you
were
speaking
of
their
weakness
i
meant
to
say
that
they
had
taken
advantage
of
mine
ah
here
we
are
thought
marcel
is
it
possible
what
of
your
weakness
these
ecclesiastics
sir
you
are
an
ecclesiastic
too
and
yet
if
mademoiselle
suzanne
durand
do
go
on
veronica
i
have
asked
you
not
to
recall
that
remembrance
to
me
it
is
wrong
of
you
to
forget
that
sweet
jesus
i
do
want
to
offend
you
i
wanted
to
make
you
understand
that
since
you
you
have
erred
the
others
and
what
have
they
done
ah
it
is
very
simple
lord
jesus
let
us
see
i
hardly
know
if
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
i
am
quite
ashamed
of
it
come
let
us
see
speak
you
have
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
before
me
speak
veronica
speak
where
must
i
begin
where
you
like
at
the
beginning
i
suppose
there
are
several
of
them
several
beginnings
yes
i
have
had
three
masters
you
know
well
with
the
last
one
with
monsieur
fortin
that
worthy
man
whom
i
knew
slightly
he
was
no
better
than
the
rest
jesus
no
the
abbé
fortin
lord
god
yes
the
abbé
fortin
what
has
he
done
then
my
god
you
know
well
that
which
one
does
when
one
is
a
man
and
has
a
warm
temperament
to
you
veronica
to
you
alas
sweet
jesus
ah
monsieur
le
curé
i
am
so
i
know
how
to
resist
and
then
you
know
it
is
so
hard
for
a
poor
servant
to
resist
her
master
particularly
when
he
is
a
priest
who
holds
all
your
confidence
and
possesses
all
your
secrets
and
with
whom
you
live
in
a
certain
kind
of
intimacy
and
besides
a
priest
is
cautious
and
one
may
be
quite
sure
that
nothing
of
what
goes
on
inside
the
parsonage
will
get
out
through
the
parsonage
door
assuredly
he
will
not
go
and
noise
his
faults
abroad
and
so
with
us
the
priests
servants
who
could
be
more
cautious
than
we
are
we
have
as
much
in
it
as
our
masters
have
we
not
and
a
sin
concealed
is
a
sin
half
pardoned
yes
veronica
it
was
said
long
ago
the
scandal
of
the
world
is
what
causes
the
offence
and
is
not
sinning
to
sin
in
silence
those
are
words
of
wisdom
who
is
it
who
said
so
a
very
clever
man
called
monsieur
tartuffe
i
see
that
be
must
have
been
a
priest
at
least
he
was
not
an
ecclesiastic
but
he
was
somewhat
of
a
churchman
that
is
just
as
i
thought
certainly
we
must
hide
our
faults
who
would
believe
in
us
without
that
i
say
for
i
am
also
somewhat
a
undoubtedly
i
have
spent
my
life
among
ecclesiastics
my
father
was
beadle
at
eprive
and
my
mother
the
curé
housekeeper
that
is
your
title
is
it
not
then
i
have
the
honour
to
be
your
and
i
am
the
head
of
the
association
of
the
holy
virgin
no
one
could
contest
your
claims
veronica
add
to
that
you
are
a
worthy
and
cautious
person
and
let
us
return
to
monsieur
fortin
ah
i
can
not
contain
my
astonishment
monsieur
fortin
and
how
did
he
go
to
work
to
seduce
you
he
must
have
used
much
deceit
all
the
angels
of
heavens
are
witnesses
to
it
sir
and
you
shall
judge
mammosa
virgo
the
monk
could
not
refrain
from
admiring
the
freshness
and
plumpness
of
this
woman
for
a
long
time
he
made
his
eyes
speak
and
he
managed
it
so
well
that
in
the
end
he
inspired
the
lady
with
the
same
desire
with
which
he
was
burning
boccacio
veronica
took
several
sips
of
the
brandy
which
remained
at
the
bottom
of
the
cup
collected
her
thoughts
for
a
moment
and
casting
her
eyes
down
with
a
modest
air
she
proceeded
the
good
monsieur
fortin
as
perhaps
you
know
used
to
drink
a
little
of
an
evening
oh
he
used
to
drink
yes
not
every
day
but
every
now
and
then
two
or
three
times
a
week
but
you
know
quite
nicely
properly
without
making
any
noise
he
was
gayer
than
usual
that
was
all
but
when
he
reached
that
point
though
he
was
ordinarily
as
timid
as
a
he
became
as
bold
as
a
gendarme
and
he
was
very
how
shall
i
say
very
enterprising
i
may
say
that
between
ourselves
monsieur
le
curé
you
understand
that
strangers
never
knew
anything
about
it
if
by
chance
anyone
came
and
asked
for
him
at
these
times
i
used
to
say
that
he
had
gone
out
or
that
he
was
one
day
i
was
finely
put
out
christopher
gilquin
daughter
came
to
call
him
to
her
mother
who
was
at
the
point
of
death
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
try
and
kiss
her
the
little
one
who
was
hardly
fifteen
did
not
know
what
it
meant
i
made
her
understand
that
it
was
to
console
her
and
through
pure
affection
for
her
and
for
her
mamma
it
passed
muster
but
when
she
had
gone
i
gave
it
to
him
finely
and
i
made
him
go
to
bed
and
sharply
too
and
he
obeyed
you
i
should
think
so
and
without
a
word
he
saw
very
well
he
was
wrong
one
evening
then
i
had
been
in
his
service
hardly
six
months
i
must
tell
you
first
that
he
had
looked
at
me
very
queerly
for
some
time
i
let
him
do
so
and
said
to
myself
here
is
another
of
them
who
will
do
like
the
rest
and
i
waited
for
it
to
happen
i
was
then
than
i
am
now
i
was
ten
years
younger
monsieur
le
curé
ten
years
younger
but
you
were
thirty
then
how
could
you
be
a
servant
at
that
age
our
rules
are
opposed
to
it
i
passed
as
his
relation
and
that
was
tolerated
besides
when
monseigneur
made
his
visitation
i
did
not
show
myself
for
form
sake
for
monseigneur
knew
very
well
that
i
was
there
i
met
him
once
on
the
stairs
he
took
hold
of
my
chin
looked
at
me
very
hard
and
said
in
a
sly
way
here
is
this
little
then
faith
she
is
a
pretty
little
rogue
i
was
so
bashful
i
asked
monsieur
fortin
what
a
was
and
he
told
me
that
they
used
formerly
to
call
women
so
who
lived
with
priests
they
say
that
all
had
two
or
three
what
indecency
i
should
not
have
allowed
that
spiritual
sister
is
not
exactly
the
expression
said
marcel
it
is
because
they
were
adopted
alas
veronica
the
clergy
were
slightly
dissolute
in
former
times
it
is
no
longer
so
in
our
days
in
which
so
many
holy
ecclesiastics
give
an
example
of
the
rarest
virtues
oh
three
wives
monsieur
le
curé
three
wives
sweet
jesus
they
must
have
torn
out
each
other
eyes
no
veronica
they
agreed
very
well
among
themselves
they
had
different
ideas
at
that
time
to
what
we
have
now
one
evening
then
monsieur
fortin
had
drunk
at
table
a
little
more
than
usual
i
was
going
to
bring
the
dessert
and
i
leaned
over
to
take
up
a
dish
which
was
before
him
as
the
dish
was
heavy
and
rather
far
from
my
hand
i
supported
myself
on
the
back
of
his
chair
and
involuntarily
i
rubbed
against
his
body
with
my
stomach
oh
oh
he
said
if
that
happens
again
i
shall
pinch
that
big
breast
what
monsieur
fortin
used
that
expression
yes
sir
and
many
others
besides
i
blush
when
i
think
of
it
then
i
looked
at
him
quite
astounded
he
began
to
laugh
i
went
to
look
for
the
cheese
and
i
passed
again
beside
him
on
purpose
and
supported
myself
on
his
chair
again
to
place
it
on
the
table
ah
he
cried
she
is
beginning
again
mammosa
he
repeated
it
so
many
times
to
me
that
i
remember
it
so
much
the
worse
i
keep
my
promises
and
he
pinched
me
where
where
he
had
said
he
made
no
error
i
blushed
for
shame
and
drew
back
as
quickly
as
possible
how
can
he
i
said
to
myself
use
latin
words
to
deceive
poor
women
then
he
cried
are
you
ticklish
yes
sir
ah
you
are
ticklish
the
big
veronica
is
ticklish
who
would
have
believed
it
and
he
laughed
but
i
saw
clearly
that
his
laugh
was
put
on
and
that
something
else
preoccupied
him
and
from
that
moment
each
time
that
i
passed
near
him
and
stooped
down
to
clear
away
he
tried
to
pinch
me
where
he
could
and
there
he
said
are
you
ticklish
are
you
ticklish
there
i
was
so
stupefied
that
i
could
not
get
over
it
it
is
a
little
too
much
holy
mother
of
god
i
said
to
myself
a
man
like
him
to
pinch
me
in
this
way
who
would
believe
it
one
would
not
credit
it
if
one
saw
it
ah
i
will
see
how
far
he
will
go
and
i
will
give
him
an
account
at
last
when
i
saw
that
he
would
not
stop
it
and
that
he
was
going
too
far
i
said
to
him
severely
monsieur
le
curé
if
you
continue
to
tease
me
in
this
way
you
shall
see
something
what
shall
i
see
he
said
getting
up
suddenly
i
want
to
see
it
directly
ah
you
threaten
your
master
wait
wait
i
will
teach
you
respect
and
pretending
to
punish
me
he
caught
hold
of
as
much
as
he
could
grasp
with
both
hands
yes
sir
as
much
as
he
could
ah
i
was
very
angry
god
can
tell
you
so
and
did
he
stop
not
at
all
sir
quite
the
contrary
i
escaped
from
his
hands
and
i
turned
round
the
table
saying
ah
sweet
jesus
what
is
going
to
happen
divine
saviour
how
far
will
he
dare
to
go
to
complete
the
misfortune
i
let
the
lamp
fall
and
it
went
out
then
he
put
himself
into
a
great
passion
and
soon
caught
me
you
have
upset
the
oil
he
cried
i
will
teach
you
to
spill
the
oil
he
held
me
with
all
his
might
then
i
got
angry
in
earnest
in
earnest
you
know
well
well
that
was
useless
i
was
taken
like
a
poor
fly
it
was
too
late
it
was
all
over
all
over
all
over
monsieur
fortin
let
me
go
then
ah
sir
if
you
knew
how
ashamed
i
was
footnote
they
are
still
called
or
women
perhaps
it
is
not
unnecessary
to
recall
the
fact
that
gregory
vii
was
the
first
of
the
popes
to
impose
celibacy
on
the
clergy
he
nullified
acts
performed
by
married
priests
and
compelled
them
to
choose
between
their
wives
and
the
priesthood
in
spite
of
this
and
in
spite
of
excommunication
with
which
he
threatened
them
many
kept
their
wives
secretly
the
rest
contented
themselves
with
concubines
besides
the
majority
of
the
bishops
who
lived
after
the
same
manner
tolerated
for
bribes
infractions
of
the
rule
by
the
lower
and
higher
clergy
the
council
of
paris
in
forbade
them
to
receive
money
proceeding
from
this

the

not

must

the
rev
father
laurent
scupoli
combat
what
a
strange
story
said
marcel
oh
veronica
but
did
you
not
make
more
resistance
resistance
i
was
lame
from
it
for
more
than
a
fortnight
i
walked
like
a
duck
people
said
to
me
what
is
the
matter
with
you
mademoiselle
veronica
they
say
you
have
broken
something
ah
if
they
had
suspected
what
it
was
what
a
scandal
monsieur
fortin
he
was
stronger
than
i
but
i
do
give
him
all
the
blame
we
must
be
just
it
was
my
fault
too
that
is
what
comes
of
playing
with
fire
but
it
seems
to
me
veronica
that
you
displayed
a
little
willingness
ah
monsieur
le
curé
you
are
scolding
me
for
telling
you
all
this
so
plainly
was
it
not
better
for
me
to
act
thus
than
to
let
monsieur
fortin
run
right
and
left
and
expose
himself
to
all
sorts
of
affronts
as
some
do
that
man
had
a
temperament
of
fire
and
that
temperament
must
have
expended
itself
on
someone
the
business
about
little
gilquin
made
me
reflect
i
sacrificed
myself
and
i
acted
as
much
in
his
interests
as
in
the
interests
of
religion
and
does
not
temperament
speak
in
you
also
veronica
ah
that
is
only
told
in
confession
nevertheless
it
is
fine
to
rule
your
passions
to
be
chaste
ah
yes
as
you
were
saying
once
when
i
came
in
chaste
without
hope
all
that
is
rubbish
god
has
well
done
all
that
he
has
done
i
ca
get
away
from
that
how
can
you
bring
the
holy
name
of
god
into
these
abominable
things
abominable
that
is
rubbish
again
monsieur
fortin
and
i
often
asked
ourselves
what
evil
that
could
do
to
god
when
neither
of
us
did
any
to
other
people
monsieur
fortin
used
to
say
to
me
are
we
doing
evil
to
our
neighbours
veronica
not
that
i
know
of
monsieur
le
curé
are
we
causing
a
scandal
ah
jesus
no
monsieur
le
curé
are
we
setting
a
bad
example
no
monsieur
le
curé
no
are
we
populating
the
land
with
orphans
oh
as
to
that
no
well
then
in
what
way
can
we
be
offending
god
that
was
very
well
said
all
the
same
the
more
so
as
his
health
depended
on
it
but
replied
marcel
wishing
to
change
the
conversation
which
was
verging
upon
dangerous
ground
have
you
not
told
me
that
you
have
been
in
the
service
of
ecclesiastics
for
nearly
years
that
appears
to
me
to
be
very
extraordinary
for
after
all
you
are
hardly
forty
corrected
veronica
who
was
past
reason
the
more
that
is
true
monsieur
le
curé
but
i
began
early
at
fifteen
i
went
to
the
abbé
braqueminet
i
was
acquainted
with
a
braqueminet
who
was
bishop
a
very
worthy
prelate
that
he
is
sir
he
went
to
america
come
this
is
too
much
veronica
you
want
to
make
a
fool
of
me
at
fifteen
do
you
say
that
is
too
much
at
thirty
you
were
with
the
abbé
fortin
i
have
no
objection
to
that
since
you
passed
as
his
relation
although
with
regard
to
this
our
rules
are
precise
and
we
can
not
take
a
housekeeper
till
she
is
over
a
certain
age
sometimes
it
is
true
they
smuggle
in
a
few
years
but
fifteen
years
it
is
the
exact
truth
however
sir
i
was
fifteen
years
old
and
no
more
at
the
abbé
braqueminet
and
you
will
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
i
was
his
niece
braqueminet
niece
you
veronica
sir
his
niece
the
holy
virgin
who
hears
me
will
tell
you
that
i
was
his
niece
and
i
will
explain
to
you
how
lii
the
posset
this
little
maid
so
fair
with
teasing
ways
was
made
to
be
a
lovely
man
support
for
many
a
foolish
thing
in
former
days
he
did
to
gain
a
face
less
fair
than
thine
béranger
my
father
as
i
have
told
you
was
beadle
at
saint
eprive
and
my
mother
was
servant
to
monsieur
le
curé
these
were
two
good
situations
but
they
had
a
number
of
children
and
not
much
time
to
attend
to
them
therefore
when
i
was
thirteen
they
entrusted
me
to
an
old
aunt
who
was
willing
to
take
charge
of
me
she
was
servant
to
monsieur
braqueminet
who
was
then
at
mirecourt
she
placed
me
at
first
with
a
lady
who
made
me
look
after
her
little
children
at
the
end
of
a
year
monsieur
had
a
change
and
went
away
to
a
village
near
he
said
to
my
aunt
you
can
not
leave
veronica
alone
at
mirecourt
she
will
soon
be
fifteen
she
is
tall
and
she
will
run
too
much
risk
and
we
must
take
her
with
us
but
as
it
would
make
these
foolish
peasants
chatter
if
their
curé
had
a
strange
young
girl
in
the
house
she
shall
pass
as
my
niece
what
do
you
say
to
this
proposal
my
aunt
was
delighted
and
agreed
to
it
directly
and
all
the
more
because
i
would
have
to
assist
her
in
the
household
work
and
that
her
labour
would
thus
be
lightened
they
took
me
away
from
my
situation
they
taught
me
my
lesson
and
i
went
away
with
them
very
pleased
to
be
monsieur
le
curé
niece
ah
that
was
the
best
time
of
my
life
my
aunt
spoilt
me
monsieur
le
curé
was
excessively
fond
of
me
i
had
all
my
wishes
all
the
ladies
in
the
neighbourhood
spoke
to
me
civilly
the
collector
wife
the
lawyer
wife
the
mayoress
the
wife
of
the
exciseman
they
all
in
short
made
much
of
me
mademoiselle
veronica
here
mademoiselle
veronica
there
i
had
my
place
in
the
gallery
they
invited
me
to
dinner
and
they
were
rivals
as
to
who
should
make
me
little
presents
as
if
i
were
really
his
true
niece
everybody
believed
it
and
my
aunt
herself
by
dint
of
hearing
it
said
ended
by
believing
it
herself
for
she
never
called
me
anything
else
than
mademoiselle
veronica
unfortunately
after
some
time
my
aunt
died
when
we
had
both
of
us
wept
copiously
for
her
monsieur
le
curé
said
to
me
now
your
aunt
is
dead
veronica
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
made
no
answer
and
burst
again
into
tears
you
must
not
cry
like
that
little
one
you
will
spoil
your
pretty
eyes
will
you
remain
with
me
will
you
continue
to
be
my
niece
that
was
my
dream
i
asked
for
nothing
more
i
thanked
monsieur
braqueminet
with
all
my
soul
and
told
him
that
as
he
wanted
me
to
be
his
niece
i
would
remain
his
niece
all
my
that
is
agreed
he
said
to
me
you
shall
keep
my
little
house
for
me
and
i
will
take
another
for
the
heavy
work
only
for
he
was
so
nice
to
me
that
he
would
not
allow
me
to
fatigue
myself
in
anything
ah
the
men
monsieur
le
curé
who
can
trust
the
men
see
what
he
has
made
of
me
after
all
his
fine
promises
a
poor
servant
nothing
more
had
he
then
any
reason
to
complain
of
you
to
complain
of
me
ah
sweet
paschal
lamb
never
has
he
said
a
word
of
reproach
but
since
i
am
in
the
mood
to
tell
you
everything
i
may
as
well
do
so
at
once
it
was
he
who
had
my
innocence
what
it
was
not
the
abbé
fortin
then
monsieur
le
curé
it
was
the
abbé
braqueminet
and
how
did
he
go
to
work
to
have
your
innocence
ah
he
was
a
very
clever
man
first
he
knew
how
to
inspire
affection
he
was
so
kind
to
me
it
was
i
who
managed
everything
i
was
mistress
of
all
although
so
young
and
pray
believe
me
everything
proceeded
well
but
one
fine
day
a
real
niece
turned
up
no
one
knows
whence
and
faith
i
was
obliged
to
retire
i
might
have
made
an
exposure
but
i
preferred
to
sacrifice
myself
was
she
younger
than
you
then
the
same
age
sir
but
she
was
fresh
fruit
she
appeared
so
innocent
that
one
would
have
given
her
the
sacrament
without
confession
monsieur
braqueminet
he
undertook
to
give
her
the
sacrament
yes
he
undertook
it
that
man
but
was
she
really
his
niece
yes
sir
his
own
sister
daughter
i
have
had
proofs
of
it
do
you
think
i
should
have
gone
away
without
that
this
sister
hated
me
and
i
thoroughly
returned
it
but
when
i
saw
her
daughter
arrive
i
said
to
myself
i
am
well
revenged
but
your
innocence
how
did
he
have
it
ah
you
are
anxious
to
know
that
i
must
tell
you
everything
then
everything
this
is
how
it
happened
he
suffered
a
little
from
his
chest
and
every
evening
my
aunt
used
to
carry
him
up
a
posset
when
my
aunt
was
dead
i
was
obliged
to
take
her
place
for
the
servant
we
had
taken
was
married
and
went
home
at
the
end
of
the
day
he
knew
very
well
what
he
was
doing
and
i
poor
little
lamb
of
god
believed
everything
i
was
like
a
child
it
is
not
right
to
be
so
silly
as
that
god
has
punished
me
for
it
it
is
quite
right
i
do
complain
at
it
so
i
used
to
take
him
up
his
posset
every
evening
then
he
used
to
kiss
me
and
squeeze
me
to
his
heart
calling
me
his
dear
niece
and
charging
me
to
be
good
you
will
always
be
good
he
used
to
say
to
me
yes
uncle
always
you
promise
me
yes
uncle
ah
let
me
kiss
you
for
that
kind
promise
i
found
that
he
kissed
me
for
rather
a
long
time
and
although
it
was
very
pleasant
to
me
still
it
used
to
give
me
reason
for
reflection
how
can
he
love
me
so
much
i
thought
when
he
is
not
my
uncle
you
can
judge
by
that
if
i
was
not
silly
but
it
is
perfectly
conceivable
for
i
had
never
been
to
school
so
who
was
there
then
to
teach
me
naughtiness
a
young
girl
brain
is
active
and
i
formed
a
thousand
fancies
of
every
kind
perhaps
he
has
some
interest
concealed
underneath
i
said
artlessly
to
myself
and
perhaps
he
does
not
love
me
as
he
wishes
me
to
believe
i
was
hardly
fifteen
and
you
see
i
was
quite
candid
and
simple
i
thought
i
would
pretend
to
be
ill
in
order
to
make
a
trial
of
him
and
see
if
he
would
be
grieved
and
if
he
would
come
and
nurse
me
so
one
evening
when
he
had
finished
supper
i
told
him
that
i
was
not
well
and
that
i
was
going
to
bed
he
was
reading
his
newspaper
and
did
not
appear
to
hear
me
at
least
he
made
no
reply
i
went
away
very
sadly
and
sorrowfully
thinking
that
his
affection
for
me
was
not
very
great
as
he
did
not
give
the
least
attention
to
my
complaints
in
short
i
went
to
bed
he
will
go
to
bed
too
very
soon
i
said
to
myself
he
will
call
for
his
posset
and
he
will
be
obliged
to
get
up
to
see
why
i
do
not
bring
it
to
him
indeed
about
an
hour
after
i
heard
his
bell
i
wrapped
myself
up
in
the
sheets
and
pretended
to
be
asleep
he
rang
a
second
time
veronica
veronica
he
cried
my
posset
what
are
you
doing
then
have
you
forgotten
it
veronica
i
turned
a
deaf
ear
liii
the
leg
one
is
compelled
sometimes
to
say
to
oneself
what
does
ruin
or
safety
depend
tourgueneff
eaux
then
i
heard
him
come
upstairs
cautiously
and
stop
at
the
door
of
my
room
all
at
once
he
opened
it
he
remained
standing
still
for
a
moment
then
he
came
near
my
bed
on
i
my
eyes
quickly
and
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
his
naked
legs
my
word
he
had
a
very
leg
i
looked
again
and
saw
that
he
was
covered
with
an
old
black
cloak
which
served
him
as
a
i
closed
my
eyes
again
quickly
and
without
giving
an
account
of
my
feelings
i
was
overcome
by
a
strong
emotion
my
uncle
passed
his
hand
over
my
forehead
he
found
it
burning
for
he
cried
out
directly
but
she
is
really
ill
she
is
really
ill
poor
child
then
leaning
over
me
little
one
little
one
where
are
you
in
pain
i
pretended
to
wake
up
with
a
start
and
i
stared
wildly
at
him
as
if
i
was
much
surprised
to
see
him
there
we
women
have
the
instinct
of
deceit
from
birth
believe
me
what
i
tell
you
is
true
monsieur
le
curé
it
is
possible
veronica
well
then
be
said
to
me
where
are
you
in
pain
little
one
i
put
my
finger
on
the
pit
of
my
stomach
and
replied
in
a
feeble
voice
here
he
put
his
hand
there
and
i
saw
that
he
moved
it
about
with
complacency
on
that
part
this
touch
seemed
to
make
him
beside
himself
oh
the
pretty
little
girl
the
pretty
little
girl
he
said
she
is
ill
poor
dear
child
and
his
hand
continued
to
caress
me
you
may
think
how
i
was
trembling
although
he
did
it
very
decently
i
said
to
myself
that
it
was
not
altogether
proper
but
i
took
good
care
not
to
utter
a
word
a
girl
is
inquisitive
you
know
and
i
was
not
displeased
to
see
what
he
would
come
to
will
you
have
a
fomentation
he
said
to
me
after
a
moment
no
uncle
i
answered
i
feel
i
am
getting
better
it
is
not
worth
while
i
am
even
going
to
get
up
to
make
you
your
posset
to
get
up
do
you
dream
of
it
all
the
same
perhaps
you
are
right
there
is
still
some
fire
in
my
room
will
you
come
there
you
will
warm
yourself
better
than
in
your
bed
i
will
if
it
does
not
disturb
you
disturb
me
no
no
do
be
afraid
of
disturbing
me
come
put
on
a
dress
and
come
i
sat
up
in
bed
thinking
that
he
would
go
out
of
the
room
to
let
me
dress
but
he
remained
standing
in
front
of
me
and
his
looks
frightened
me
i
remained
sitting
on
the
bed
without
stirring
well
well
little
girl
you
are
not
getting
up
i
dare
not
get
up
before
you
uncle
are
you
silly
what
are
you
afraid
of
are
you
not
my
niece
come
come
out
of
bed
little
stupid
he
said
that
in
a
gentle
insinuating
voice
and
i
dared
not
hesitate
any
more
i
put
one
leg
out
of
bed
he
followed
my
movements
with
the
greatest
attention
well
well
and
that
other
leg
i
put
out
the
other
leg
blushing
all
over
with
shame
and
i
wanted
to
take
my
petticoat
but
he
came
near
directly
and
said
oh
the
lovely
little
lass
how
pretty
she
is
like
this
you
will
always
be
good
will
you
not
yes
uncle
how
pretty
you
are
when
you
are
good
you
will
always
be
so
you
promise
yes
uncle
oh
i
want
to
kiss
you
for
that
kind
promise
i
held
out
my
cheek
to
him
without
resistance
but
it
was
my
mouth
which
received
the
kiss
it
was
followed
by
a
thousand
others
one
is
not
of
iron
monsieur
le
curé
and
that
was
how
i
lost
my
innocence
what
veronica
you
fell
so
easily
they
say
that
it
is
only
the
first
step
which
is
painful
but
it
seems
hardly
to
have
been
painful
to
you
oh
monsieur
le
curé
we
women
are
full
of
faults
and
we
deserve
only
eternal
damnation
i
do
not
say
that
veronica
certainly
in
this
circumstance
all
the
fault
lies
on
your
seducer
but
i
should
have
preferred
more
struggle
on
your
part
you
men
are
very
good
with
your
struggle
to
hear
you
we
never
make
enough
resistance
would
one
not
say
that
the
poor
women
are
made
of
another
paste
than
you
and
that
they
ought
to
be
harder
no
but
it
is
necessary
to
know
how
to
govern
one
passions
that
is
the
noble
the
lofty
the
meritorious
thing
resist
temptation
everything
lies
in
that
plate
iii
the
leg
oh
the
lovely
little
lass
how
pretty
she
is
like
this
illustration
everything
lies
in
that
i
know
it
well
but
what
would
you
i
had
lost
my
head
entirely
like
monsieur
braqueminet
and
i
did
not
know
what
he
wanted
or
what
he
was
going
to
do
i
only
understood
when
it
was
too
late
ah
veronica
you
singular
woman
you
have
made
me
quite
beside
myself
with
your
stories
it
was
you
who
wished
it
the
abbé
fortin
the
abbé
braqueminet
god
of
heaven
and
who
besides
the
abbé
marcel
yes
it
is
true
i
also
i
have
been
on
the
point
of
transgressing
ah
temptation
is
sometimes
very
strong
veronica
my
good
veronica
the
noble
thing
is
to
resist
the
greatest
saints
have
succumbed
origen
was
obliged
to
employ
a
grand
means
you
know
what
my
daughter
monsieur
fortin
has
told
me
but
you
must
not
act
like
that
saint
that
would
be
a
pity
it
would
be
better
to
succumb
dear
monsieur
marcel
how
i
like
your
name
marcel
marcel
it
is
so
soft
to
the
mouth
to
resist
temptation
like
jesus
on
the
mountain
there
was
but
one
jesus
like
antony
in
the
desert
that
is
rubbish
in
the
desert
no
one
could
tempt
him
leave
the
room
veronica
since
you
have
talked
to
me
i
understand
the
fault
of
your
former
masters
leave
the
room
are
you
afraid
of
me
then
angels
of
heaven
a
woman
like
me
is
it
possible
ah
i
should
have
been
very
proud
of
it
proud
to
make
me
sin
sin
sin
monsieur
le
curé
why
do
we
call
that
a
sin
she
came
nearer
to
him
he
wished
to
rise
from
his
chair
but
his
hand
went
astray
he
never
knew
how
on
his
servant
waist
oh
vow
of
chastity
sentiments
of
modesty
manly
dignity
and
priestly
virtue
where
were
you
where
were
you
liv
mater
saeva
cupidinum
well
you
have
found
it
this
ephemeral
happiness
babillot
mascarade
sadness
succeeds
to
joy
deception
to
illusion
the
awakening
to
the
dream
the
to
the
debauch
when
the
crime
is
perpetrated
remorse
the
avenging
lash
of
virtue
comes
and
scourges
the
conscience
come
up
vile
thing
thou
hast
slept
over
long
and
it
exposes
to
the
wretch
the
emptiness
of
pleasures
purchased
at
the
price
of
honour
the
dawn
found
the
curé
of
althausen
groaning
secretly
to
himself
on
his
couch
he
had
made
himself
guilty
of
an
abominable
wickedness
he
had
just
committed
an
inexcusable
crime
he
had
succumbed
cowardly
ignominiously
he
had
betrayed
his
faith
abjured
his
priestly
oaths
forgotten
his
duties
prostituted
his
dignity
on
the
withered
breast
of
an
old
corrupted
suzanne
the
adorable
young
girl
who
in
the
first
place
had
insensibly
and
involuntarily
drawn
him
on
the
road
of
perjury
for
whom
he
would
have
sacrificed
honour
reputation
the
universe
and
his
god
he
had
abjured
her
also
in
the
arms
of
this
drab
and
that
was
the
wound
which
consumed
his
heart
the
most
for
as
soon
as
we
have
yielded
to
the
infernal
temptation
the
lying
prism
vanishes
the
halo
disappears
and
there
only
remains
vice
in
all
its
hideousness
and
repulsive
nudity
it
is
then
that
we
hear
a
threatening
voice
mutter
secretly
in
the
depths
of
our
being
happy
is
he
who
already
slipping
on
the
fatal
descent
listens
to
that
voice
stop
stop
there
is
still
time
raise
thyself
up
but
most
frequently
we
remain
deaf
to
that
importunate
cry
and
weary
of
crying
in
vain
conscience
is
silent
it
no
more
casts
its
solemn
serious
note
into
the
intoxicating
music
of
facile
love
and
the
wretch
devoured
by
insatiable
desire
pursues
his
coarse
and
looks
not
back
he
goes
on
he
ever
goes
on
leaving
right
and
left
like
the
trees
on
the
his
vigour
and
his
youth
which
he
scatters
behind
him
he
set
forth
young
robust
and
strong
and
he
arrives
at
the
soiled
and
blemished
there
is
the
ditch
and
he
tumbles
headlong
into
it
he
falls
into
the
common
grave
of
cowardice
and
infamy
the
lowest
depths
receive
him
and
restore
him
not
again
seek
no
more
for
there
is
no
more
the
worms
which
consume
him
to
his
gums
have
already
consumed
his
brain
and
his
heart
is
but
gangrened
disturb
not
this
corpse
it
is
only
putrefaction
the
poet
has
said
evil
to
him
who
has
permitted
lewdness
beneath
his
breast
its
foremost
nail
to
delve

pure

a
goblet

the
first
water

therin
is

the
sea
itself
could
not
wash
out
the
spot
so
deep
the
chasm
where
the
stain
doth
lie
marcel
had
not
reached
that
point
but
he
felt
that
he
was
on
a
rapid
descent
and
made
these
tardy
reflections
to
himself
shall
i
ever
be
able
to
see
the
light
of
day
shall
i
ever
dare
to
raise
my
eyes
after
this
filthy
crime
oh
heaven

overwhelm
me

omnipotent
god
reduce
me
to
ashes
restore
me
again
to
the
nothingness
from
which
i
ought
never
to
have
come
forth

heaven
did
not
overwhelm
him

day
nor
was
there
the
slightest
rumbling
of
thunder
nature
continued
her
work

as
if
no
minister

god
had
sinned
the
sun
a
glorious
sun
of
spring
came
and
danced
on
his
window
and
he
heard
as
usual
the
happy
cries
of
the
pillaging
sparrows
as
they
fluttered
in
his
garden
there
was
a
movement
by
his
side
and
he
felt
close
to
his
flesh
the
burning
flesh
of
veronica
she
was
awake
and
looking
at
him
with
a
smile
she
felt
no
remorse
she
was
proud
and
happy
and
her
eyes
burning
with
pleasure
and
want
of
sleep
were
fixed
on
her
new

him

reeked

there
was

summoned
him
to
his
morning
mass

it
cheerfully
filled
the
air

its
silver
notes
the
morning
was
as
bright
as
the
face
of
a
bride
may
was
shedding
its
perfumes
and
flowers
on
the
paths
and
displaying
everywhere
its
marvellous
adornments
of
universal
life

and

tumbling
about

the
birds
were
warbling
in

grasshopper
was
saluting

rising
sun
and
he
in
the
midst
of
all
this
joy
and
all
this
life
was
walking
on
with
his
head
filled
with
vague
ideas
of
suicide
a
few
peasants
passed
near
him
and
sainted
him
he
saw
them
not
he
saw
not
the
children
who
stopped
still
and
gazed
in
bewilderment
at
his
strange
appearance
he
saw
not

who
was
approaching
at
the
end
of
the
path

was
only
a
few
paces
away
when
he
raised
his
head
and
all
his
blood
rushed
to
his
heart
vision
blessed
and
cursed
at
the
same
time
she
she
there
at
the
vary
moment
of
the
consummation
of
his
shame
she
before
him
when
he
had
just
dug
an
abyss
between
them
what
should
he
say
would
she
not
read
on
his
troubled
face
the
shameful
secret
of
the
drama
within
was
not
his
crime
written
on
his
sullied
brow
in
indelible
soars
he
would
have
wished
the
earth
to
open
under
his
feet

she
advanced
blushing
perhaps
as
greatly
agitated
as
himself
and
from
the
smile
on
her
rosy
lips
from
the
brightness
of
her
dark
eyes
from
the
gram
of
her
carriage
from
the
chaste
swelling
of
her
bosom
from
the
folds
of
her
dress
which
blown
by
the
morning
breeze
revealed
the
harmonious
outlines
of
her
fairy
leg
from
all
those
inexpressible
maiden
charms
there
breathed
forth
that
for
which
there
is
no
name
in
the
language
of
men
but
which
accelerates
the
beating
of
the
heart
which
pours
into
the
veins
an
unknown
fluid
and
bids
us
murmur
low
to
the
stranger
who
passes
by
and
whom
perhaps
we
may
never
see
again
my
life
is
thine
is
thine
mysterious
sensation
which
in
the
golden
days
of
youth
we
have
all
experienced
once
at
least
with
ravishing
delight
and
everything
seemed
to
say
to
marcel
fool
if
thou
hadst
wished
it
we
were
thine
the
delights
of
paradise
were
thine
and
thou
hast
preferred
the
impurities
of
hell
oh
if
he
had
been
able
if
he
had
dared
he
would
have
cast
himself
at
this
maiden
feet
he
would
have
kissed
her
knees
he
would
have
grovelled
on
the
ground
and
cried
with
tears
pardon
pardon
fate
has
caused
it
all
almighty
god
will
never
pardon
me
but
it
is
thou
whom
i
implore
and
what
matters
it
if
thou
thou
dost
pardon
me
the
feeling
of
the
reality
recalled
him
to
himself
who
was
aware
of
his
fault
and
what
was
there
besides
in
common
between
this
young
girl
and
himself
one
evening
when
alone
with
her
he
had
acted
imprudently
that
was
all
and
it
was
now
long
ago
then
through
desperation
and
also
to
show
that
he
attached
no
importance
to
that
act
of
imprudence
which
he
had
almost
forgotten
he
assumed
an
icy
demeanour
she
advanced
with
a
smile
but
she
felt
it
congeal
on
her
lips
before
this
insolent
coldness
while
he
gravely
bowing
to
her
as
before
a
stranger
passed
on
lvi
double
remorse
ah
how
much
better
are
the
which
we
spelt
in
our
eyes
with
our
hearts
camille
lemonnier
his
mass
said
marcel
did
not
want
to
return
to
the
parsonage
he
made
his
way
slowly
to
the
wood
absorbed
by
a
world
of
thoughts
all
was
quite
changed
since
the
day
before
and
what
a
revolution
had
been
wrought
in
his
soul
in
one
day
the
day
before
there
was
still
time
to
stop
there
was
time
to
cast
far
away
temptations
and
impure
desires
to
avoid
the
infernal
snares
and
ambushes
to
take
refuge
according
to
the
apostle
advice
in
the
bosom
of
god
now
it
was
too
late
it
was
no
longer
in
his
power
he
found
himself
hemmed
in
within
the
circle
of
abominations
and
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
get
forth
a
double
remorse
tormented
him
and
wrung
his
conscience
with
fierce
fingers
on
the
one
hand
there
was
his
servant
become
his
accomplice
and
his
mistress
an
odious
thing
his
servant
defiling
his
couch
hitherto
immaculate
his
couch
of
a
virtuous
priest
then
on
the
other
there
was
the
fair
pale
face
of
suzanne
full
of
reproaches
surprised
and
sad
why
had
he
not
stopped
what
fury
had
urged
him
forward
cold
and
scornful
when
he
burned
to
hear
once
again
the
sound
of
that
voice
which
stirred
his
heart
and
the
memory
of
that
meeting
at
the
very
moment
of
the
consummation
of
his
infamy
was
the
blow
of
the
lash
which
laid
bare
the
open
wound
of
his
remorse
he
did
not
curse
his
crime
more
than
the
inopportuneness
and
the
awkwardness
of
that
crime
what
be
had
given
himself
up
to
a
despicable
old
woman
he
had
slaked
the
thirst
of
that
ghoul
with
his
generous
blood
he
had
abandoned
to
that
the
promises
of
his
young
body
and
his
virgin
soul
while
a
young
girl
whose
like
he
had
never
seen
but
in
fairy
tales
and
dreams
came
to
him
and
seemed
to
say
to
him
you
may
love
me
and
he
had
repulsed
her
in
order
to
give
himself
up
to
the
former
that
horrible
creature
that
hypocrite
that
sorceress
and
now
that
his
judgment
was
calm
he
could
not
understand
how
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
carried
away
by
such
clumsy
manoeuvres
that
he
had
fallen
in
so
cowardly
a
way
and
for
such
an
object
if
at
least
it
had
been
in
the
arms
of
the
lovely
if
his
virtue
had
melted
under
the
kisses
of
her
charming
lips
but
no
none
of
all
that
none
of
those
unparalleled
joys
of
those
ineffable
delights
of
those
divine
and
sweet
pleasures
unclean
touches
a
withered
body
an
impure
mouth
lewdness
instead
of
love
and
his
servant
caresses
recurred
to
him
and
froze
him
like
the
infernal
spectres
of
a
hideous
nightmare
he
saw
again
her
face
lighted
up
by
amorous
fever
her
fiery
lecherous
look
fastening
on
him
with
all
the
wild
fury
of
her
years
with
the
cynicism
of
the
sham
saint
who
has
thrown
away
her
mask
and
who
after
long
fasting
continence
and
privation
finds
at
length
the
means
of
glutting
herself
and
wallows
more
than
any
other
in
the
sewer
of
obscenities
and
saturnalia
he
saw
her
again
like
the
old
courtesan
of
horace
nigris
dignissima
soliciting
horribly
her
too
avaricious
caresses
and
employing
all
the
arsenal
of
her
filthy
seduction
to
excite
him
meanwhile
the
hours
were
passing
away
the
spirit
travels
in
vain
into
the
land
of
phantoms
nature
performs
her
modest
functions
without
caring
for
the
wanderings
of
the
spirit
he
felt
by
the
pangs
of
his
stomach
that
he
had
as
yet
only
breakfasted
on
the
body
of
christ
a
meagre
repast
after
a
night
consecrated
to
venus
in
short
he
was
hungry
and
he
decided
to
return
to
the
parsonage
lvii
the
explosion
what
dost
thou
want
with
me
old
vixen
worthy
to
have
black
elephants
for
thy
lovers
with
what
passion
dost
thou
reproach
me
for
my
disgust
horace
veronica
was
waiting
for
him
with
a
puckered
smile
at
another
time
she
would
have
made
a
great
uproar
for
the
hour
for
the
meal
had
struck
long
ago
but
she
did
not
wish
to
abuse
her
freshly
conquered
rights
and
she
contended
herself
with
asking
in
accents
of
soft
reproach
how
late
you
are
where
have
you
come
from
i
was
beginning
to
be
anxious
marcel
made
no
reply
you
do
answer
me
why
this
silence
are
you
vexed
already
where
have
you
come
from
i
have
just
been
reading
my
breviary
replied
marcel
sharply
the
servant
smiled
and
pointed
out
to
him
his
breviary
lying
on
the
table
why
tell
a
lie
she
said
i
do
bear
you
any
because
you
went
towards
the
wood
although
i
should
have
preferred
to
see
you
return
here
quickly
ah
you
are
not
like
me
you
have
not
my
impatience
but
men
are
all
like
that
they
do
all
they
can
to
have
a
woman
and
afterwards
they
scorn
her
this
sentence
struck
the
curé
to
the
heart
like
a
pin
prick
it
opened
his
wounds
already
bleeding
overmuch
it
recalled
the
shameful
memory
which
he
wished
to
drive
away
and
which
rose
up
obstinately
before
him
you
are
changing
our
parts
in
a
strange
manner
he
cried
indignantly
there
you
are
vexed
why
are
you
vexed
what
have
i
done
to
you
have
i
said
anything
wrong
to
you
do
you
then
regret
ah
doubtless
i
am
not
young
enough
or
pretty
enough
for
you
i
pray
enough
upon
that
shameful
subject
you
are
revolting
what
do
you
say
replied
the
woman
wounded
to
the
quick
i
have
no
need
to
repeat
it
you
heard
me
i
think
i
heard
you
it
is
true
but
i
thought
i
was
mistaken
ah
i
am
revolting
revolting
well
i
am
content
to
learn
it
from
your
mouth
but
it
is
not
that
you
ought
to
tell
me
that
sir
it
was
yesterday
yesterday
she
cried
insolently
yesterday
yesterday
oh
let
us
forget
yesterday
i
implore
you
i
would
that
there
were
between
yesterday
and
the
night
and
the
oblivion
of
the
tomb
yes
is
that
your
thought
well
for
my
part
i
will
forget
nothing
oh
you
are
pleased
to
wish
to
forget
are
you
therefore
you
give
yourself
up
to
all
your
passions
you
make
use
of
a
poor
girl
in
order
to
satiate
them
and
the
next
day
when
you
are
tired
and
weary
from
your
debauchery
with
no
pity
for
the
unhappy
one
who
has
trusted
you
you
say
let
us
forget
ah
i
know
you
all
well
you
virtuous
gentlemen
you
fine
priests
who
preach
continency
and
morality
you
are
all
just
the
same
all
of
you
do
you
hear
veronica
be
silent
in
the
name
of
heaven
i
will
not
be
silent
i
will
not
so
much
the
worse
if
they
hear
me
what
does
that
matter
to
me
poor
unhappy
creature
that
i
am
it
is
not
i
who
am
guilty
it
is
you
it
is
not
i
who
am
charged
to
teach
morality
it
is
you
it
is
not
i
who
preach
fine
sermons
on
sunday
about
chastity
and
purity
and
morals
and
who
hide
myself
behind
the
shutters
to
watch
tumblers
dancing
in
the
who
entice
little
girls
at
night
under
some
pretest
or
other
and
who
kiss
them
when
the
servant
has
turned
her
back
yes
yes
you
have
done
that
i
blush
for
you
and
you
are
monsieur
le
curé
monsieur
le
curé
if
that
would
make
the
hens
laugh
ah
what
does
it
matter
to
me
that
they
hear
me
telling
you
the
truth
it
is
not
i
who
will
be
despised
by
everybody
it
will
be
you
have
i
gone
and
sought
for
you
have
i
you
have
made
me
tell
you
a
lot
of
stories
which
ought
not
to
be
told
except
in
confession
you
have
made
me
sit
down
beside
you
drink
brandy
and
then
afterwards
you
have
taken
advantage
of
me
yes
you
have
taken
advantage
of
your
a
poor
girl
who
has
been
all
her
life
the
victim
of
priests
like
you
no
i
will
not
be
silent
i
will
cry
it
upon
the
if
i
must
ah
you
have
taken
me
like
a
thing
which
one
makes
use
of
when
convenient
and
which
one
throws
away
when
one
has
no
more
need
of
it
i
understand
you
but
i
have
more
than
that
although
i
am
only
a
poor
servant
you
want
to
forget
very
good
but
i
do
not
want
to
forget
and
i
shall
not
forget
oh
i
well
know
what
it
is
your
want
messieurs
les
curés
you
want
young
girls
quite
young
girls
green
fruit
which
you
pick
like
that
at
the
confessional
or
in
some
corner
without
appearing
to
touch
it
and
all
the
while
praying
to
god
i
am
aware
of
that
you
know
you
can
not
teach
any
tricks
to
me
you
did
not
get
up
early
enough
my
good
master
your
suzanne
there
is
what
would
please
you
you
would
not
tell
her
that
she
is
revolting
affected
thing
but
they
will
give
you
them
wait
a
little
and
see
if
they
are
coming
the
little
girls
come
like
that
and
throw
themselves
at
your
neck
you
would
allow
it
perhaps
that
is
what
would
be
revolting
but
the
mammas
are
watching
and
the
papas
are
opening
their
eyes
you
hear
monsieur
le
curé
the
papas
that
is
what
annoys
you
papa
durand
here
cried
a
voice
of
thunder
from
the
bottom
of
the
and
it
resounded
in
marcel
ears
like
the
trumpet
of
the
last
judgment
pale
and
terrified
he
questioned
veronica
with
his
eyes
it
is
he
she
said
hurrying
to
the
lviii
provocation
for
her
for
her
i
will
drink
the
cup
to
the
dregs
a
de
vigny
a
thousand
pardons
said
the
captain
but
the
door
was
open
and
i
have
knocked
twice
monsieur
le
curé
i
have
the
honour
to
salute
you
i
am
not
disturbing
you
not
at
all
monsieur
le
capitaine
quite
the
contrary
i
am
happy
to
see
you
please
come
in
stammered
marcel
trying
to
conceal
his
confusion
and
to
look
pleasantly
at
the
old
soldier
he
eagerly
brought
forward
an
for
him
the
one
on
which
suzanne
had
sat
ah
he
thought
if
he
knew
that
his
daughter
was
there
at
this
same
place
the
captain
sat
down
and
tapping
his
cane
on
the
floor
seemed
to
be
seeking
for
a
way
of
entering
on
his
subject
he
appeared
anxious
and
marcel
noticed
that
he
no
longer
had
his
decisive
scoffing
manner
monsieur
le
curé
he
said
after
a
moment
silence
you
must
be
a
little
surprised
to
see
me
although
after
what
i
believe
i
heard
i
may
not
be
altogether
a
stranger
here
my
parishioners
are
no
strangers
captain
parishioner
oh
i
am
hardly
that
i
was
not
making
allusion
to
that
title
but
to
my
name
which
was
uttered
at
the
very
moment
when
i
was
at
your
door
your
name
captain
said
marcel
growing
red
but
there
are
several
persons
of
your
name
that
is
what
i
said
to
myself
there
is
more
than
one
donkey
which
is
called
neddy
and
more
than
one
durand
in
the
world
that
recalls
to
me
my
position
as
father
sir
and
the
purpose
of
my
presence
here
marcel
trembled
for
you
may
guess
that
independently
of
the
pleasure
of
paying
you
a
call
i
have
moreover
another
object
in
view
proceed
captain
yes
sir
i
wish
to
talk
to
you
about
my
daughter
about
your
daughter
cried
marcel
about
my
daughter
if
you
allow
me
do
so
i
beg
of
you
monsieur
le
curé
you
have
been
in
this
neighbourhood
some
six
or
eight
months
people
have
certainly
spoken
to
you
about
me
they
have
told
you
who
i
am
a
miscreant
a
man
without
religion
who
regards
neither
law
or
gospel
that
is
to
say
only
worth
hanging
in
spite
of
that
you
came
to
see
me
very
good
you
know
that
i
do
not
pick
and
choose
my
words
that
i
do
not
seek
a
lot
of
little
twisting
ways
to
express
my
meaning
you
have
had
a
proof
of
it
i
am
blunt
and
even
brutal
that
is
well
known
but
i
am
open
and
true
i
do
not
doubt
it
captain
after
our
little
conversation
the
other
day
you
must
have
decided
on
my
sentiments
with
regard
to
those
of
your
profession
are
those
sentiments
right
or
wrong
that
is
my
business
i
am
not
come
to
begin
a
controversy
i
am
come
to
ask
for
an
explanation
please
go
on
said
marcel
alarmed
not
liking
the
priests
i
should
have
wished
to
bring
up
my
daughter
in
these
principles
you
see
i
am
straightforward
unfortunately
like
many
other
things
her
education
has
slipped
out
of
my
hands
we
soldiers
do
not
accumulate
property
and
those
who
have
the
best
share
if
they
have
no
private
fortune
remain
as
poor
as
job
we
are
not
able
therefore
to
bring
up
our
children
as
we
intend
the
state
in
its
solicitude
is
willing
to
undertake
this
care
we
are
glad
of
it
and
we
are
thankful
to
the
state
but
our
children
slip
out
of
our
hands
they
become
what
the
state
wishes
them
to
be
that
is
to
say
its
humble
servants
and
if
they
are
daughters
anything
but
what
their
father
has
ever
dreamed
marcel
breathed
again
the
vocation
of
children
he
said
softly
is
often
in
contradiction
to
the
wishes
of
parents
and
that
is
precisely
the
sign
of
the
real
vocation
to
shatter
obstacles
where
is
the
great
artist
the
great
man
the
hero
the
saint
the
martyr
who
has
not
had
to
struggle
with
his
own
family
i
am
not
speaking
of
a
vocation
sir
but
of
prejudices
of
fatal
habits
of
disheartening
nonsense
which
children
and
especially
young
girls
imbibe
in
certain
surroundings
the
education
which
my
daughter
has
received
has
inoculated
her
with
ideas
which
i
am
far
from
blaming
in
a
woman
i
have
my
religion
myself
too
but
the
abuse
of
which
i
resent
i
am
not
then
at
war
with
my
daughter
because
she
has
her
own
and
her
own
is
more
receptive
but
what
i
blame
with
all
my
power
and
what
i
am
determined
to
oppose
with
all
my
power
is
the
excessive
attendance
at
church
and
on
the
priest
on
the
priest
above
all
you
are
a
man
sir
and
you
understand
me
do
you
not
i
understand
captain
that
you
do
not
wish
your
daughter
to
go
to
church
as
little
as
possible
sir
nevertheless
as
a
christian
and
as
a
catholic
she
has
duties
to
perform
what
do
you
mean
by
duties
why
the
first
elements
which
the
catechism
prescribes
i
do
not
remember
exactly
what
your
catechism
prescribes
but
if
you
mean
by
that
the
little
box
where
they
tell
their
sins
that
is
exactly
what
i
absolutely
forbid
nevertheless
a
young
person
has
need
of
counsel
undoubtedly
but
that
counsel
i
intend
to
give
myself
there
is
also
the
priest
part
captain
allow
me
to
have
another
opinion
besides
the
adviser
is
too
young
that
is
why
monsieur
le
curé
i
ask
you
to
abstain
in
the
future
from
all
advice
and
undertake
to
abandon
any
intention
you
may
have
with
regard
to
the
direction
of
this
young
soul
such
is
the
purport
of
my
visit
monsieur
le
capitaine
answered
marcel
relieved
from
a
great
weight
i
am
an
honourable
man
another
perhaps
might
be
offended
at
this
proceeding
i
will
take
no
offence
at
it
another
perhaps
might
answer
it
is
a
soul
to
contend
for
with
satan
it
is
the
struggle
between
the
church
and
the
family
an
old
struggle
sir
an
eternal
struggle
you
are
master
to
impose
your
will
among
your
own
just
as
among
us
we
are
masters
to
act
according
to
our
conscience
as
a
father
of
a
family
your
rights
are
sacred
but
they
stop
at
the
entrance
to
the
holy
place
you
desire
the
struggle
it
lies
between
us
for
myself
i
simply
reply
let
it
be
done
according
to
your
wish
and
may
the
will
of
god
equally
be
done
and
what
does
that
mean
that
your
daughter
is
and
shall
be
in
my
eyes
like
all
the
souls
which
heaven
has
willed
to
entrust
to
my
care
if
she
does
not
come
to
church
i
will
not
go
to
seek
her
but
if
she
comes
there
i
can
not
ask
her
to
depart
you
are
really
too
good
and
if
she
comes
and
kneels
in
the
little
box
then
the
will
of
god
will
be
stronger
than
the
paternal
will
that
is
no
answer
well
what
can
i
do
humbly
replied
marcel
allow
me
sir
i
ask
you
what
you
would
do
in
such
a
case
i
make
you
the
judge
of
it
can
i
treat
your
daughter
differently
to
the
other
ladies
of
the
parish
that
is
to
say
that
you
will
receive
her
confession
that
will
be
my
duty
captain
i
am
frank
also
you
see
but
monsieur
le
curé
the
first
of
your
duties
is
not
to
encourage
the
disobedience
of
children
and
not
to
place
yourself
between
a
father
and
his
daughter
i
place
myself
on
no
side
captain
i
confine
myself
as
far
as
i
can
to
the
very
obscure
and
modest
character
of
a
poor
priest
i
am
charged
with
an
office
is
it
possible
i
ask
you
yourself
for
me
to
repel
those
who
address
themselves
to
that
office
very
good
sir
said
the
captain
rising
i
know
henceforth
what
to
rely
on
pardon
me
captain
but
allow
me
to
say
that
your
proceedings
and
apprehensions
appear
to
me
a
trifle
superfluous
for
indeed
if
you
have
a
reproach
to
make
your
daughter
it
is
not
that
of
excessive
devotion
for
it
is
a
long
time
since
she
has
come
to
church
i
have
forbidden
it
to
her
sir
but
my
daughter
is
grieved
and
that
pains
me
i
came
to
address
myself
to
you
man
to
man
and
as
you
see
i
am
disappointed
believe
me
captain
let
the
thing
alone
do
nothing
in
a
hurry
young
people
are
irritated
by
obstacles
they
need
freedom
and
diversion
think
of
this
young
lady
position
dropped
from
her
school
into
the
midst
of
this
solitude
having
neither
friends
or
companions
any
longer
at
that
age
the
family
is
not
everything
books
walks
music
are
not
sufficient
what
harm
is
there
in
her
coming
sometimes
on
sunday
to
hear
divine
service
we
do
not
conceal
it
from
ourselves
sir
that
many
women
whom
we
see
at
service
come
there
for
relaxation
and
it
is
precisely
that
relaxation
which
ruins
them
not
in
the
church
sir
not
there
no
but
behind
in
the
sacristy
or
at
the
back
of
some
room
adieu
sir
i
do
not
want
to
criticize
your
language
captain
but
one
word
more
i
ask
is
your
daughter
acquainted
with
your
proceeding
why
that
question
because
then
my
task
will
be
all
traced
out
what
task
to
avoid
every
sort
of
intercourse
do
what
honour
counsels
you
and
trust
to
me
for
the
rest
i
will
act
with
my
daughter
as
it
will
be
suitable
for
me
to
act
as
for
you
you
have
asserted
that
any
other
priest
would
have
said
to
me
we
are
going
to
engage
in
the
struggle
it
lies
between
us
i
see
now
that
in
your
mouth
the
word
signifies
for
you
have
been
polite
but
the
other
alone
would
have
been
frank
and
honourable
between
us
is
better
between
us
pleases
me
it
is
plainer
and
shorter
again
i
have
the
honour
to
salute
you
lix
acts
and
words
intrigues
of
heavy
dreams
we
go
to
the
right
darkness
we
go
to
the
left
darkness
in
front
darkness
the
thread
which
you
think
you
hold
escapes
out
of
your
hand
and
triumphant
for
a
moment
you
set
yourself
again
to
grope
your
way
to
the
catastrophe
which
is
a
denseness
of
shadows
camille
lemonniere
when
the
captain
had
gone
away
marcel
perceived
the
triumphant
face
of
his
servant
mad
with
shame
and
rage
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
room
and
asked
himself
what
was
going
to
become
of
him
what
am
i
to
do
he
said
to
himself
here
is
the
punishment
already
nevertheless
on
serious
reflection
he
saw
a
way
all
traced
out
before
him
it
was
the
ancient
the
good
the
old
way
which
he
had
followed
until
then
and
into
which
the
captain
had
just
brutally
driven
him
back
the
way
of
his
duty
to
forget
suzanne
he
had
that
very
morning
without
wishing
it
almost
unknowingly
commenced
the
rapture
the
father
visit
had
just
completed
the
work
to
forget
suzanne
yes
he
would
forget
her
he
must
not
only
his
honour
his
reputation
but
his
very
existence
were
involved
in
it
material
impossibilities
rose
up
before
him
in
every
direction
where
he
tried
to
deviate
from
the
straight
path
his
servant
the
father
he
was
compelled
to
be
an
honourable
man
anyhow
not
lost
sight
of
watched
and
spied
upon
by
these
two
enemies
to
forget
suzanne
how
after
what
had
passed
the
previous
day
would
he
dream
for
a
moment
of
remembering
her
he
was
almost
thankful
to
his
servant
for
having
stopped
him
in
time
on
a
descent
at
the
end
of
which
was
scandal
and
dishonour
in
any
other
circumstances
his
pride
would
have
revolted
at
the
menaces
of
the
foolish
father
he
would
have
been
stung
in
his
and
he
would
have
disputed
with
him
for
his
treasure
but
where
was
his
pride
where
was
his
dignity
he
had
left
all
that
on
the
lap
of
a
cook
reputation
was
safe
that
was
henceforth
the
only
good
which
he
must
keep
at
any
price
come
said
he
keep
it
have
courage
stand
up
son
of
saints
and
martyrs
yield
not
hesitate
not
march
forward
without
being
anxious
for
what
is
on
the
right
or
left
do
thy
duty
in
one
direction
since
in
the
other
thou
hast
failed
is
a
man
then
lost
because
he
has
for
one
moment
deviated
from
his
way
is
he
dead
for
one
false
step
peter
denied
his
master
three
times
thou
hast
done
so
but
once
the
postman
ring
drew
him
from
his
reverie
he
ran
to
receive
the
letter
recognized
the
writing
hastily
put
it
into
his
pocket
took
up
his
hat
and
his
breviary
and
went
out
without
saying
a
word
when
he
was
in
the
little
hollow
road
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
he
turned
round
and
certain
that
he
was
not
being
followed
only
then
did
he
open
the
letter
which
follows
monsieur
le
curé
why
are
you
vexed
with
me
if
you
have
not
seen
me
any
more
at
mass
it
is
that
i
have
had
to
contend
with
my
father
and
that
i
have
been
obliged
to
yield
nevertheless
i
am
unhappy
and
more
than
ever
have
i
need
of
your
counsel
you
have
said
can
not
serve
two
masters
and
is
very
difficult
to
render
to
caesar
that
which
is
caesar
and
to
god
that
which
is
god
one
word
if
you
please
through
the
medium
of
marianne
to
your
very
devoted
he
tore
up
the
letter
into
the
smallest
fragments
and
returned
home
in
all
haste
a
few
hours
after
marianne
received
the
following
notice
evening
at
in
honour
of
the
holy
virgin
there
will
be
salutation
and
benediction
at
the
chapel
of
anne
the
faithful
are
besought
to
attend
footnote
thou
art
man
and
not
god
says
the
holy
book
of
consolation
thou
art
flesh
and
not
an
angel
how
canst
thou
always
continue
in
very
virtue
lx
talks
when
from
the
hills
fell
balmy
night
the
dark
foliage
of
the
lofty
trees
starred
by
the
placid
light
often
we
wandered
by
the
water
side
camille
delthil
as
he
expected
she
did
not
fail
to
be
at
the
she
was
unaware
of
her
father
proceedings
it
was
marcel
who
informed
her
of
them
she
was
quite
terrified
but
he
reassured
her
and
knew
how
to
soothe
her
young
conscience
and
meeting
followed
meeting
dear
and
innocent
meetings
the
most
prudish
old
woman
would
have
found
nothing
to
find
fault
with
the
mystery
and
their
being
forbidden
formed
all
their
charm
the
chapel
of
anne
distant
from
the
village
was
a
charming
object
for
a
walk
you
cross
the
meadow
as
far
as
the
little
river
bordered
with
willows
then
the
chapel
is
reached
by
a
hollow
lane
hedged
with
quicksets
the
sweet
month
of
may
had
begun
three
evenings
a
week
the
little
nave
was
in
festal
dress
and
filled
with
light
and
perfumes
and
flowers
suzanne
went
no
more
to
mass
but
she
had
said
to
her
father
will
you
not
let
me
go
instead
and
take
a
walk
sometimes
beside
saint
anne
to
hear
the
music
and
the
singing
of
the
congregation
marianne
shall
accompany
you
replied
durand
they
were
always
the
last
to
leave
the
chapel
and
marcel
soon
rejoined
them
it
was
at
some
winding
of
the
path
that
he
used
to
meet
them
and
every
time
he
showed
great
surprise
they
walked
slowly
along
talking
of
one
thing
and
another
the
spring
the
latest
books
the
captain
rheumatism
were
themes
of
inexhaustible
variety
the
future
sometimes
attracted
their
thoughts
her
own
future
and
the
priest
tried
to
cause
a
few
fresh
rays
to
shine
into
the
young
unquiet
soul
they
talked
also
of
the
school
and
of
friends
who
had
gone
out
into
the
world
one
of
them
a
fair
child
with
blue
eyes
was
her
and
the
fairest
of
the
fair
and
marcel
sometimes
felt
jealous
of
these
warm
friendships
he
did
not
disdain
to
talk
of
fashions
it
is
one
way
of
pleasing
and
he
admired
aloud
the
elegant
cut
of
the
waist
the
twig
of
lilac
fastened
to
the
body
of
her
dress
and
the
graceful
art
which
had
twined
her
long
jetty
plaits
she
smiled
and
said
what
you
too
you
too
you
pay
attention
to
these
woman
trifles
but
what
matters
the
topic
of
their
conversations
all
they
could
say
was
not
worth
the
joyous
note
which
sang
at
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
when
they
drew
near
the
village
he
bowed
to
her
respectfully
and
each
one
returned
by
a
different
way
marianne
was
then
profuse
in
her
praises
a
fine
curé
she
said
so
kind
and
civil
if
your
father
only
knew
him
better
and
suzanne
who
returned
very
thoughtful
said
once
the
curé
can
it
be
it
is
the
curé
then
lxi
le
père
hyacinthe
she
still
preserved
for
herself
that
little
scene
thus
little
by
little
we
accumulate
within
ourselves
all
the
elements
of
the
inner
life
emile
leclercq
fille
du
she
had
shown
marcel
the
portrait
of
her
beloved
rose
yes
she
is
very
pretty
he
had
replied
but
i
prefer
dark
girls
suzanne
blushed
he
opened
his
breviary
and
drew
out
a
card
are
you
going
to
show
me
a
dark
girl
she
said
he
handed
it
to
her
without
answering
it
was
the
photograph
of
a
man
of
about
forty
with
and
characteristic
features
the
eyes
prominent
and
slightly
veiled
were
surrounded
with
a
dark
ring
a
token
of
struggle
fatigue
and
deception
a
profile
out
of
a
picture
of
holbein
in
dress
it
is
a
priest
she
cried
it
is
a
priest
indeed
answered
marcel
we
are
recognized
in
any
costume
we
can
not
conceal
our
identity
do
you
know
who
that
is
is
it
not
that
monk
who
has
made
such
a
noise
that
dominican
who
has
married
and
broken
with
the
church
yes
mademoiselle
the
young
girl
regarded
it
with
curiosity
it
must
have
been
a
violent
passion
to
come
to
that
she
said
no
it
was
an
idea
well
resolved
upon
and
matured
no
transport
of
youth
carried
him
away
see
he
is
no
longer
young
and
the
companion
he
has
chosen
is
very
nearly
his
own
age
and
he
had
for
her
only
a
tender
and
holy
feeling
why
then
this
uproar
and
scandal
in
order
to
protest
aloud
against
a
rule
which
he
did
not
approve
in
our
days
there
are
so
many
cowardly
and
degenerate
characters
that
we
can
not
too
greatly
admire
those
who
have
the
courage
to
proclaim
their
opinion
in
the
presence
of
the
mob
especially
when
those
opinions
shock
the
brutalized
mob
for
my
part
i
admire
this
man
but
what
i
admire
still
more
is
the
woman
who
has
dared
to
put
her
hand
in
his
and
brave
the
derision
of
the
vulgar
and
the
calumnies
of
hypocrites
but
his
vows
what
is
a
vow
when
it
is
a
question
of
the
duty
which
your
conscience
dictates
i
heard
him
say
one
day
if
after
reaching
middle
age
i
have
decided
after
long
reflection
to
choose
a
companion
it
is
not
in
response
to
the
cry
of
the
senses
but
in
order
to
sanctify
my
life
he
has
taken
back
the
word
which
he
had
given
as
we
all
do
at
an
age
when
we
are
ignorant
of
the
import
and
the
consequence
of
that
word
be
assured
that
his
conscience
does
not
reproach
him
for
you
can
see
on
this
fine
countenance
that
his
conscience
is
at
rest
besides
is
it
the
case
that
god
enjoins
celibacy
the
celibacy
of
priests
dates
only
from
the
year
christ
never
speaks
about
it
and
so
he
has
broken
with
all
his
past
his
relations
his
world
he
has
ruined
what
you
men
call
his
future
he
must
begin
his
life
again
and
he
begins
it
again
in
accordance
with
his
inclinations
his
needs
and
his
heart
it
is
never
too
late
to
change
the
road
when
we
discover
that
we
have
taken
the
wrong
way
it
takes
longer
time
there
is
more
hardship
but
what
matters
it
provided
we
attain
happiness
the
end
which
we
all
have
in
view
ah
mademoiselle
how
many
like
he
would
wish
to
begin
their
life
again
if
they
found
a
courageous
soul
who
was
willing
to
accompany
them
the
future
do
you
say
but
the
future
the
present
the
past
the
whole
life
lies
in
the
sweet
union
of
hearts
to
devote
oneself
to
renounce
everything
to
give
up
everything
even
one
illusions
one
beliefs
one
dreams
for
the
loved
object
is
not
a
sacrifice
it
is
the
sweetest
of
joys
and
the
noblest
of
duties
he
stopped
fearing
that
he
had
gone
too
far
and
did
not
dare
to
look
at
suzanne
she
answered
coldly
ah
monsieur
le
curé
you
approve
of
that
i
did
not
think
you
would
have
approved
of
père
hyacinth
truly
i
am
astonished
le
it
was
the
first
time
suzanne
had
called
him
le
that
name
wounded
him
like
an
affront
he
remembered
what
he
was
and
what
he
must
not
cease
to
be
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
girl
the
curé
nothing
but
the
curé
and
he
was
sick
at
heart
for
several
days
but
one
fine
morning
on
coming
out
from
mass
his
countenance
lit
up
he
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
and
fell
into
the
arms
of
abbé
ridoux
lxii
the
happy
curé
such
was
socrates
said
to
have
been
because
the
outside
beholders
and
those
estimating
him
by
his
external
appearance
would
not
have
given
the
slice
of
an
onion
so
plain
was
he
in
his
person
and
ridiculous
in
his
bearing
simple
in
habits
poor
in
fortune
unfortunate
with
women
unfit
for
all
the
offices
of
the
republic
always
laughing
always
drinking
with
one
or
another
always
sporting
always
concealing
his
divine
wisdom
rabelais
monsieur
ridoux
was
a
very
good
fellow
but
he
was
not
handsome
a
big
nose
a
big
belly
blinking
eyes
an
enormous
mouth
hair
on
end
the
arm
of
a
chimpanzee
and
the
legs
of
a
greenlander
at
first
sight
he
gave
me
the
impression
of
a
monkey
with
young
but
what
is
a
man
outward
form
the
vessel
more
or
less
regular
filled
with
a
baneful
or
beneficent
liquid
and
you
all
know
that
the
shape
of
the
flagon
has
no
influence
on
the
quality
of
the
wine
the
outward
form
is
the
wrapper
of
the
goods
very
often
that
wrapper
is
brilliant
and
gilded
of
satin
or
watered
silk
and
the
goods
are
adulterated
and
spoiled
at
other
times
the
wrapper
is
rough
and
coarse
but
it
enfolds
precious
commodities
the
stamp
of
genius
is
usually
found
only
on
countenances
with
fantastic
features
have
you
ever
seen
on
the
fair
insipid
faces
of
our
the
imprint
of
a
powerful
and
fertile
intelligence
the
body

the
vincent
voiture
who
had
as
he
confessed
himself
the
silly
face
of
a
dreaming
sheep
used
to
say
that
nature
usually
likes
to
place
the
most
precious
souls
in
puny
bodies
as
jewellers
set
the
richest
diamonds
in
a
small
quantity
of
gold
accordingly
the
pitiful
wrapper
of
the
abbé
ridoux
covered
an
excellent
soul
with
his
ugly
face
and
his
old
stained
cassock
he
reminded
me
of
those
dirty
bottles
coated
with
and
dust
which
we
place
daintily
on
the
table
on
days
of
rejoicing
and
which
lord
it
majestically
among
the
glittering
decanters
soon
to
be
despised
when
their
dusty
sides
appear
thus
monsieur
ridoux
lorded
it
amongst
his
curates
younger
handsomer
fresher
more
tasty
than
himself
and
eclipsed
them
by
all
the
brilliancy
of
his
his
tact
and
his
experience
he
had
certainly
his
little
failings
who
can
say
that
he
is
exempt
from
them
but
his
mind
was
sound
a
good
companion
besides
and
of
a
cheerful
disposition
we
have
reached
a
period
he
used
to
say
when
the
priest
must
lay
aside
the
stern
front
and
the
anathema
there
is
already
much
to
obtain
pardon
for
in
the
colour
of
his
robe
let
us
be
cheerful
let
us
be
insinuating
let
us
be
compassionate
to
human
weaknesses
let
us
sin
if
need
be
with
discretion
and
propriety
but
in
heaven
name
let
us
not
terrify
let
us
promise
paradise
to
all
there
are
always
plenty
enough
whose
life
is
a
hell
in
that
he
was
not
of
veuillot
opinion
that
rigid
saint
who
wished
to
see
all
the
world
damned
for
the
love
of
god
therefore
on
seeing
this
cheerful
countenance
this
openness
of
manner
this
freedom
of
speech
this
unrestrained
even
those
who
had
been
warned
could
not
help
saying
well
indeed
this
curé
has
a
pleasant
phiz
slanderous
tongues
voltairians
who
is
sheltered
from
the
stings
of
that
race
of
vipers
slanderous
tongues
affirmed
that
beneath
this
rabelaisian
exterior
he
was
profoundly
vicious
artful
and
hypocritical
marcel
who
had
been
brought
up
by
him
and
was
acquainted
with
the
most
secret
details
of
his
inmost
life
has
always
assured
me
that
he
was
nothing
of
the
kind
and
that
his
uncle
ridoux
endowed
with
the
ugliness
of
socrates
had
also
his
wisdom
nevertheless
i
would
not
dare
to
assert
that
he
did
not
like
to
pinch
the
young
girls
chins
especially
of
those
who
had
made
their
first
communion
and
were
near
to
the
marriageable
age
a
familiarity
which
thanks
to
his
gray
hairs
and
the
development
of
his
abdomen
he
thought
was
permitted
him
but
which
however
is
not
always
without
danger
cazotte
a
wise
man
used
to
say
to
his
daughters
when
you
are
alone
with
young
people
distrust
yourselves
but
if
you
find
yourselves
with
old
men
distrust
them
and
avoid
allowing
them
to
take
hold
of
your
chin
cazotte
was
right
for
old
men
begin
with
that
i
would
not
dare
either
to
assert
that
the
charms
of
his
cook
were
safe
from
his
indiscreet
curiosity
for
it
is
there
too
that
old
men
finish
and
we
must
swear
not
at
all
everybody
knows
the
wise
man
precept
when
in
doubt
abstain
at
the
period
of
which
i
am
speaking
to
you
he
reigned
in
a
good
parish
well
frequented
by
devout
ladies
both
young
and
where
from
the
height
of
his
pulpit
he
laid
down
his
laws
to
his
kneeling
people
without
hindrance
or
control
he
was
happy
as
all
wise
men
ought
to
be
happy
to
be
in
the
world
satisfied
to
be
a
curé
it
is
the
first
of
professions
he
often
used
to
say
and
there
is
not
one
of
them
which
can
be
compared
to
it
i
am
a
village
curé
where
i
live
most
modestly
i
no
important
person
but
i
happy
and
content
no
i
do
not
envy
aught
for
my
wants
they
are
but
small
how
i
love
to
pass
my
days
within
the
house
of
god
but
if
he
had
complained
it
would
have
been
very
hard
and
everybody
in
the
diocese
from
monseigneur
the
bishop
to
his
sexton
would
have
risen
with
indignation
and
called
him
ungrateful
wretch
for
ridoux
was
favoured
above
all
his
colleagues
above
all
his
colleagues
divine
providence
bad
overwhelmed
him
with
its
favours
he
possessed
in
his
parish
in
his
very
church
at
his
door
beneath
his
eyes
beneath
his
hand
a
real
blessing
from
heaven
a
grace
of
god
a
pactolus
always
rolling
down
a
mine
of
peru
a
secret
of
an
alchemist
the
veritable
philosopher
stone
caught
sight
of
by
nicolas
flamel
and
vainly
sought
for
till
the
time
of
cagliostro
a
marvel
which
made
him
at
once
honoured
and
envied
which
made
his
name
celebrated
which
gave
him
a
preponderant
voice
in
the
chapter
and
a
place
in
the
episcopal
council
which
swelled
his
heart
with
pride
and
his
with
crowns
he
had
in
the
choir
of
his
church
behind
the
mother
altar
in
a
splendid
laid
on
a
bed
of
blue
velvet
an
old
yellow
skeleton
the
relics
of
a
saint
but
there
are
saints
and
saints
those
which
do
miracles
and
those
which
do
them
not
those
which
work
and
those
which
rest
monsieur
ridoux
saint
worked
lxiii
the
miracles
miracles
have
served
for
the
foundation
and
will
serve
for
the
continuation
of
the
church
until
antichrist
until
the
end
de
the
miserable
herd
of
people
who
have
no
faith
those
who
are
still
plunged
in
the
rut
of
unbelief
are
ignorant
perhaps
that
all
the
saints
have
done
miracles
that
they
have
all
begun
in
that
way
that
that
is
the
condition
qua
for
entrance
into
the
blessed
confraternity
no
money
no
swiss
no
miracles
no
saint
it
is
in
vain
that
during
all
your
life
you
shall
have
been
a
model
of
candour
and
virtue
it
is
in
vain
that
you
shall
edify
the
universe
by
your
piety
and
your
good
works
that
you
shall
have
resisted
like
antony
the
temptations
of
the
flesh
that
you
shall
have
covered
yourself
with
like
theresa
with
venom
like
veuillot
with
filth
like
alacoque
or
with
lice
like
labre
it
is
in
vain
that
you
shall
have
been
beaten
with
rods
like
roche
been
scourged
by
your
confessor
like
elizabeth
that
finally
you
shall
have
sinned
only
six
instead
of
seven
times
a
day
if
at
your
death
you
should
not
succeed
in
performing
some
fine
miracle
you
will
never
be
admitted
into
the
calendar
the
pope
causes
your
shade
to
appear
before
his
sacred
tribunal
and
according
as
the
number
of
the
dead
whom
you
have
raised
to
life
is
judged
sufficient
or
not
as
the
touch
of
your
tibia
or
coccyx
has
cured
the
itch
or
scrofula
or
not
you
are
admitted
or
excluded
it
is
a
difficult
profession
to
be
a
saint
and
is
not
for
anyone
who
wishes
it
therefore
the
candidates
who
die
in
the
odour
of
sanctity
hasten
to
accomplish
their
regular
total
of
prodigies
in
order
that
our
father
the
pope
may
be
pleased
to
assign
them
a
place
in
the
highest
heaven
they
have
hardly
closed
their
eyes
before
they
begin
to
allured
by
the
hope
of
being
crowned
with
a
glorious
halo
they
display
infinite
zeal
and
we
have
seen
them
from
their
to
their
prepuce
effecting
the
most
marvellous
miracles
that
of
jesus
christ
i
speak
of
the
prepuce
is
preserved
thus
in
several
churches
all
of
which
contend
for
the
honour
of
possessing
the
veritable
one
it
is
not
yet
exactly
known
which
is
the
best
but
all
without
distinction
work
wonders
and
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
are
kissed
by
pious
young
women
but
this
noble
zeal
of
the
saints
lasts
but
for
a
time
and
this
is
a
proof
of
the
imperfection
of
human
kind
that
our
faults
and
whims
follow
us
even
beyond
the
tomb
the
saints
themselves
fall
into
all
the
little
meannesses
so
common
with
the
most
ordinary
sinners
like
candidates
who
solicit
the
votes
of
the
mob
in
order
to
gain
power
and
make
the
most
brilliant
promises
which
they
hasten
to
forget
as
soon
as
they
have
climbed
the
stairs
so
the
candidates
for
canonization
perform
marvels
at
first
but
once
admitted
into
the
seventh
heaven
they
appear
to
trouble
themselves
no
more
concerning
lowly
mortals
or
perhaps
miraculous
properties
are
like
all
other
faculties
as
they
grow
old
they
become
and
an
who
has
stoutly
brought
the
dead
to
life
when
he
was
only
an
aspirant
for
honours
is
now
only
capable
of
curing
the
ringworm
but
as
i
have
said
it
was
a
zealous
candidate
that
the
abbé
ridoux
had
in
his
church
his
bones
had
been
there
for
fifty
years
and
as
the
time
for
his
canonization
had
not
yet
arrived
and
he
had
as
yet
only
the
rank
of
his
zeal
had
not
grown
cold
each
saint
we
all
know
has
his
medical
speciality
like
ricord
for
instance
or
ollivier
suppose
you
are
suffering
from
ophthalmia
and
instead
of
consulting
a
physician
you
pray
to
god
in
hopes
that
god
will
cure
you
you
are
wrong
that
does
not
concern
god
it
is
the
business
of
claire
who
has
the
principal
management
of
the
sight
of
the
faithful
you
are
paralyzed
and
you
commend
yourself
to
your
patron
saint
you
must
not
address
yourself
to
me
that
one
answers
go
to
the
other
office
see
marcel
or
to
make
the
impotent
walk
is
entrusted
to
him
and
so
one
after
another
st
cloud
cures
the
boils
cornet
the
deaf
denis
anemia
marcou
diseases
in
the
neck
eutropus
the
dropsy
aignan
the
ringworm
and
it
is
generally
admitted
that
we
ought
to
pray
on
all
saints
day
to
be
preserved
from
a
cough
and
observe
how
the
good
people
of
france
are
always
the
most
enlightened
and
intelligent
people
in
the
universe
the
speciality
of
monsieur
ridoux
candidate
was
broken
legs
girls
in
complaints
of
childhood
and
fluxes
of
the
womb
that
was
what
he
healed
but
he
must
not
be
asked
for
anything
else
besides
fluxes
of
the
womb
sprains
and
girls
in
complaints
of
childhood
he
did
not
attend
to
anything
that
is
conceivable
one
can
not
do
everything
it
is
quite
unnecessary
to
state
that
he
did
not
give
all
his
consultations
free
and
that
he
did
not
work
for
fame
alone
no
one
was
constrained
to
pay
it
is
true
but
it
would
have
been
a
very
unhandsome
thing
not
to
make
a
preliminary
contribution
to
monsieur
le
curé
little
presents
have
always
maintained
friendship
and
there
is
nothing
like
sterling
silver
to
predispose
the
benevolence
of
the
saints
and
the
love
of
heaven
in
our
favour
while
on
the
contrary
a
poorly
furnished
niche
affronts
the
saint
the
god
deserts
and
when
we
enter
shows
his
anger
from
the
door
of
his
poor
shrine
he
no
longer
worked
but
on
all
the
cripples
came
from
twenty
leagues
round
and
there
were
miracles
then
for
crutches
as
in
the
time
of
paris
the
deacon
when
cardinal
de
noailles
kept
a
register
of
the
wonders
of
médard
cemetery
a
churchwarden
of
the
place
assisted
by
two
secretaries
and
the
corporal
of
gendarmes
religiously
inscribed
the
miraculous
cures
of
the
saint
on
a
magnificent
volume
witnesses
attested
these
prodigies
and
if
necessary
gave
details
to
the
incredulous
if
all
were
not
cured
they
had
the
hope
of
being
so
which
was
a
consolation
and
then
whispered
monsieur
ridoux
in
the
ear
of
sceptics
if
the
touching
of
these
blessed
bones
produces
no
benefit
you
are
sure
it
will
do
no
harm
and
you
can
not
say
the
same
of
your
doctor

you
have

seems
to

you

are

are

stubborn
and
claim
to
be
the

of

younger

themselves
that
is
the

what

you
we
must
pass

tell
me
she
is
not
so
as
that
ah
come

i
do
not

you

about

and
that
together

my

you

therefore
you
can
explain
my

wrath
at

at
seeing
you
extinguishing

the
day
before

a
letter
reached
me
from

it
was
monseigneur
secretary
little
gaudinet
who
wrote
to
me
you
know
gaudinet
no
uncle
he
is
not
a
bad
fellow
but
a
devil
to
intrigue
well
as
he
knows
the
interest
i
take
in
you
and
as
he
wants
to
creep
up
my
sleeve
because
he
hopes
soon
to
take
the
place
of
one
of
my
curates
he
wrote
to
me
that
monseigneur
had
spoken
of
you
with
interest
and
that
he
proposed
to
put
an
end
to
your
exile
i
recognize
there
the
comtesse

good

you
see
that

so

and
take
yourself
off

why
already
have
you
any

do
at
nancy
that
is
just
why
i
have
come
you
impatient
young
man
to
point
out
to
you
what
line
of
conduct
to
follow
and
as
i
know
you
are
rather
more
scrupulous
than
there
is
any
need
for
in
our
profession
to
assist
you
in
removing
certain
scruples
which
might
stand
in
the
way
of
your
promotion
heavens
what
scruples
we
will
talk
about
them
at
table
meanwhile
this
is
the
question
i
have
told
you
that
i
will
move
heaven
and
earth
for
you
you
however
must
help
me
a
little
on
your
side
for
whatever
i
may
do
i
can
effect
nothing
without
you
in
his
letter
gaudinet
informs
me
that
the
parish
of
mary
nancy
is
deprived
of
its
pastor
it
came
into
my
head
directly
that
you
must
take
the
place
of
the
defunct

is
an
excellent

indeed
which
constitutes

from
for
a
poor
priest
you
are
young
you
are
handsome
you
are
intelligent
you
are
energetic
while
you
are
waiting
for
something
better
i
promise
you
an
existence
there
of
which
the
most
ambitions
of
village
curés
has
never
dared
to
dream
but
we
most
hasten

presses
gaudinet
tells
me
that
there
are
already
at
least
a
dozen
candidates
in
earnest
and
although
old
collard
intentions
and
he
intends
to
atone
for
his
former
injustice
regarding
you
are
favourable
you
are
well
aware
that
he
allows
himself
to
be
led
by
the
nose
and
generally
the
last
one
who
talks
to
him
is
right
you
must
be
then
both
the
first
and
the
last
and
you
must
not
let
him
slip
not
you
but
your
second
your
your
or
rather
your
protectress
the
comtesse
de
montluisant
but
i
do
not
know
this
lady
it
is
precisely
for
that
reason
that
it
is
indispensable
for
you
to
hasten
to
go
and
see
her
in
order
to
make
her
acquaintance
you
have
only
to
present
yourself
and
i
assure
you
even
if
you
were
not
sent
by
me
she
would
receive
you
with
the
greatest
pleasure
for
between
ourselves
be
it
said
she
is
an
elderly
coquette
but
she
is
and
knows
how
to
remember
her
old
friends
you
will
have
therefore
to
be
amiable
insinuating
respectful
assiduous
you
might
even
tell
her
that
she
is
charming
and
that
one
sees
she
has
been
very
pretty
which
is
true
old

dote
on
young
people
and
devout
old

on
young

on
those
with

friend
there
is
a
precious
soul
what
a
misfortune
that
she
is
a
little
it
is
all
the
same
to
you
and
if
you
are
wise
you
will
pass
over
that
defect
which
she
amply
atones
for
by
her
amiable
qualities
she
has
the
complete
mastery
of
monseigneur
she
is
the
maintenon
of
that
old
louis

her
what
she
is
to
him
and

the
mastery
of
her
in
your
turn
i
was
talking
to
you
a
little
while
ago
about
scruples
for
once
you
must
leave
them
at
home
or
put
them
in
the
bottom
of
your
cassock
you
have
understood
me
i
hope
no
uncle

do

talking

i
declare

that
i
do
understand
you

face

the
white
of
my
eyes
yes

and
dare
to
tell
me
that
you
have
not
understood
me
and
keep
serious
ah
ah
you
are
laughing
you
are
laughing
you

i
allow
that
it
is

to
be

ch
lemesles
they
sat
down
to
table
it
was
an
excellent
meal
and
the
worthy
ridoux
tried
to
make
it
cheerful
but
a
vague
feeling
of
sorrow
oppressed
marcel
that
departure
which
he
had
so
eagerly
desired
before
and
the
hope
of
which
he
had
clung
to
as
one
lays
hold
of
a
means
of
safety
he
could
not
think
of
without
grief
when
he
saw
it
near
and
practicable
undoubtedly
he
would
leave
without
regret
this
village
where
his
youth
was
buried
where
his
abilities
were
rendered
unfruitful
where
his
sanguine
aspirations
were
slowly
killing
themselves
but
suzanne
that
sweet
name
which
he
murmured
low
with
love
that
sweet
young
girl
the
sight
of
whom
was
as
pleasant
as
a
he
was
going
to
leave
her
for
ever
it
was
for
his
good
his
honour
his
quiet
his
future
he
knew
it
he
felt
it
but
he
was
full
of
sorrow
meanwhile
he
overwhelmed
his
uncle
with
marks
of
attention
and
friendship
he
made
every
effort
to
cope
with
his
guest
cheerful
discourse
who
after
relating
the
flight
of
the
surprised
in
criminal
conversation
with
the
wife
of
the
captain
of
gendarmerie
acquainted
him
all
the
little
ecclesiastical
scandals
but
he
gave
only
a
partial
attention
his
thoughts
were
absorbed
in
his
inmost
preoccupations
now
and
again
only
did
he
let
fall
a
few
observations
in
reply
how
horrible
or
how
shocking
or
again
how
abominable
ridoux
did
not
appear
at
first
to
pay
attention
to
his
nephew
gloomy
thoughts
he
laughed
and
joked
all
alone
but
he
did
not
miss
a
mouthful
old
priests
are
generally
greedy
good
cheer
is
one
of
the
joys
which
is
left
to
them
with
no
serious
preoccupation
with
no
anxiety
for
the
future
exempt
from
family
cares
they
transfer
all
their
solicitude
to
themselves
and
make
a
divinity
of
their
belly
but
when
his
appetite
sharpened
by
his
journey
was
appeased
he
examined
marcel
with
curiosity
and
what
he
observed
combined
with
a
few
indiscreet
words
of
veronica
confirmed
him
in
his
suspicions
that
a
drama
was
being
enacted
in
the
young
man
soul
do
you
know
he
said
to
him
that
you
are
a
pitiable
companion
you
scarcely
eat
you
scarcely
speak
you
do
not
drink
and
you
laugh
still
less
why
what
the
matter
with
you
are
you
not
gratified
at
my
visit
forgive
me
uncle
but
i
am
rather
poorly
said
marcel
that
is
my
excuse
that
is
what
the
told
me
but
you
declared
to
me
that
you
were
quite
well
how
can
you
suppose
that
i
am
not
happy
to
see
you
you
know
my
feelings
well
i
know
that
you
have
excellent
feelings
but
i
find
you
quite
changed
it
is
scarcely
a
year
since
i
saw
you
and
you
bear
marks
of
weariness
you
stoop
like
an
old
man
look
at
me
always
the
same
firm
as
a
rock
god
smites
the
wicked
with
many
plagues
but
he
encompasseth
with
his
help
those
that
hope
in
him
second
penitential
psalm
you
are
not
wicked
what
plague
consumes
you
ambition
patience
everything
will
be
changed
since
your
enemy
is
vanquished
is
it
your
conscience
which
is
ill
at
ease
but
conscience
should
be
cheerful
that
is
its
true
sign
is
it
anything
else
come
tell
me
well
yes
uncle
there
is
something
the
same
complaint
as
before
you
know
when
i
hesitated
to
enter
the
seminary
when
i
had
doubts
about
my
vocation
you
ended
my
hesitation
and
silenced
my
doubts
you
have
made
a
priest
of
me
well
now
more
than
ever
i
have
moments
of
lassitude
which
make
me
disgusted
with
my
calling
really
yes
there
are
hours
when
this
priest
robe
devours
me
like
the
robe
of
nessus
i
wish
that
i
could
tear
it
off
but
i
feel
that
i
should
tear
off
pieces
of
my
flesh
at
the
same
time
for
it
is
too
late
and
it
has
become
a
portion
of
myself
i
am
ashamed
to
make
this
confession
to
you
but
you
wished
it
and
i
have
opened
my
heart
to
you
may
it
not
be
that
the
heart
is
sick
come
i
see
that
i
am
come
to
take
you
away
from
here
at
a
seasonable
time
do
not
believe
that
uncle
so
much
the
better
if
i
am
mistaken
i
should
be
delighted
to
be
mistaken
to
be
in
love
my
son
is
the
greatest
act
of
stupidity
which
a
priest
can
commit
make
use
of
women
if
you
will
for
your
health
and
your
satisfaction
and
not
for
theirs
otherwise
you
are
a
lost
man
in
truth
uncle
you
have
singular
theories
cried
marcel
have
you
not
then
taken
your
calling
seriously
my
calling
i
have
taken
it
so
seriously
that
you
will
never
see
me
handling
it
but
in
the
practical
way
therefore
among
those
who
surround
me
i
enjoy
a
fine
reputation
for
wisdom
to
be
wise
is
to
be
happy
and
i
have
contrived
so
as
to
pass
my
existence
in
the
most
pleasant
manner
possible
i
counsel
you
to
make
as
much
of
it
and
i
am
going
to
tell
what
i
mean
by
being
wise
make
use
of
the
things
of
life
with
moderation
discretion
and
prudence
now
what
constitutes
life
spirit
and
matter
well
i
wisely
make
the
enjoyments
of
matter
and
spirit
march
abreast
i
obtain
the
equilibrium
health
of
body
and
health
of
soul
as
soon
as
the
equilibrium
is
broken
the
mental
faculties
are
deranged
or
the
constitution
declines
you
are
in
one
of
these
two
cases
my
dear
fellow
i
yes
you
and
in
spite
of
all
your
denials
i
wager
that
you
are
in
love
ah
ah
ah
it
is
a
good
story

keeps
his
countenance
like
a
thrashed
donkey
come

the
lord
in
his
benefits
your
glass
is
always
full
enjoy
yourself
you
do
entertain
your
uncle
every
day
marcel
emptied
his
glass

she
possessed
of
a
husband
but
uncle
i
do
know
what
you
want
to
talk
about
oh
how
well
dissimulation
is
grafted
in
this
young
man
heart
i
congratulate
you
on
it
it
is
good
for
strangers
for
the
profane
but
i
marcel
i
am
i
a
stranger
brought
up
in
the
seraglio
i
know
its
windings
come
another
drop
of
this
wine
which
could
make
the
dead
laugh
listen
uncle
you
are
my
second
father
my
master
my
first
director
my
only
true
friend
yes
i
want
to
ask
your
advice
i
am
afraid
of
soiling
one
day
the
robe
which
i
wear
i
am
afraid
of
becoming
an
object
of
shame
and
compassion
ah
i
am
unhappy
here
we
are
cried
ridoux
speak
the
only
point
is
to
understand
one
another
lxvi
good
counsel
ah
my
friend
have
not
all
young
people
ridiculous
passions
my
son
is
enamoured
of
virtue
the
customs
of
the
word
the
need
of
pleasure
and
the
facilities
of
satisfying
himself
will
bring
him
insensibly
to
a
moderate
state
of
feeling
and
at
thirty
he
will
be
just
like
any
other
man
he
will
enjoy
life
and
shut
his
eyes
to
many
things
which
shock
him
blanc
et
le
at
that
moment
veronica
came
in
to
serve
coffee
in
honour
of
her
master
guest
she
had
put
on
her
black
dress
of
associate
and
her
silver
medal
and
on
her
head
she
wore
coquettishly
an
embroidered
cap
trimmed
with
tulle
of
dazzling
whiteness
the
old
curé
threw
himself
into
his
with
his
head
back
in
order
to
contemplate
her
with
admiration
she
went
and
came
clearing
the
table
and
he
followed
her
movements
with
the
eye
of
a
connoisseur
estimating
the
value
of
an
article
he
smiled
sanctimoniously
and
the
smile
and
attention
which
the
bashful
veronica
noticed
made
her
blush
and
cast
her
eyes
modestly
down
eh
he
seemed
to
say
here
is
a
girl
who
is
still
fit
to
adorn
a
bed
when
the
servant
had
left
the
room
he
rose
drew
the
screen
between
the
table
and
the
door
and
then
came
and
sat
down
again
facing
marcel
i
do
understand
he
said
why
a
man
should
go
and
search
away
from
home
amid
perils
and
obstacles
for
a
pleasure
which
he
can
obtain
comfortably
quietly
with
no
fear
or
disquietude
at
his
own
to
what
are
you
pleased
to
allude
there
is
a
girl
ridoux
continued
who
certainly
has
merit
and
i
am
convinced
that
many
younger
ones
are
not
worth
as
much
as
she
she
is
there
in
your
hands
at
your
door
in
your
home
ready
i
am
sure
to
satisfy
all
your
requirements
avail
yourself
of
her
willingness
no
make
use
of
this
blessing
which
you
possess
again
no
you
throw
it
aside
to
run
after
phantoms
alas
all
the
men
of
your
age
are
the
same
like
the
dog
in
the
fable
they
let
go
their
prey
to
seize
the
shadow
you
are
like
the
fool
who
spends
his
life
in
vainly
following
fortune
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
world
and
who
when
he
returns
to
his
hearth
wearied
and
aged
finds
it
sitting
at
his
door
but
he
is
too
late
to
be
able
to
enjoy
it
that
girl
is
really
very
well
handsome
fresh
very
with
a
decent
and
respectable
appearance
why
then
do
you
disdain
her
why
tell
me
because
she
is
a
few
years
older
than
you
but
that
is
just
what
you
young
priests
require
you
require
women
of
that
age
matrons
with
more
sense
than
yourselves
she
is
staid
she
is
ripe
she
is
experienced
a
mistress
of
love
science
and
above
all
she
has
a
great
quality
an
inestimable
quality
she
is
cautious
and
will
never
compromise
you
uncle
i
implore
you
let
me
finish
another
thing
which
is
very
valuable
she
is
full
of
little
attentions
for
her
master
ah
you
are
not
aware
with
what
tender
solicitude
with
what
kindness
with
what
jealous
affection
an
old
mistress
surrounds
you
she
fears
more
for
your
health
than
for
her
own
she
is
acquainted
with
your
tastes
and
knows
how
to
anticipate
them
she
satisfies
all
your
desires
and
lends
herself
to
all
your
fancies
what
a
conversation
if
anyone
heard
us
be
easy
i
have
drawn
the
screen
the
young
mistress
is
fickle
egotistical
capricious
she
exacts
adoration
and
most
frequently
loves
you
for
a
whim
and
for
want
of
occupation
the
old
one
devotes
herself
entirely
to
you
and
does
not
ask
you
sublime
that
you
should
love
her
but
only
that
you
should
let
her
love
you
balzac
extolled
the
women
of
thirty
that
was
because
he
had
not
tasted
those
of
forty
ah
the
women
of
forty
they
are
the
only
women
who
are
of
value
to
the

my
friend
you
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
one
here
and
instead
of
profiting
by
it
of
thinking
yourself
fortunate
of
thanking
heaven
and
piously
and
devoutly
enjoying
the
good
which
god
grants
you
you
cast
it
away
you
disdain
you
despise
it
and
why
for
some
giddy
little
thing
who
will
bring
upon
you
every
kind
of
vexation
and
unpleasantness
you
can
speak
now
marcel
made
no
reply
with
his
elbows
resting
on
the
table
and
his
head
in
his
hands
he
stared
at
his
uncle
he
asked
himself
if
he
was
really
awake
if
it
was
really
his
adopted
father
the
mentor
of
his
childhood
the
wise
and
virtuous
curé
of
nicholas
who
was
talking
to
him
so
he
knew
the
worthy
man
somewhat
eccentric
character
his
coarse
witticisms
in
bad
taste
but
he
never
could
have
believed
that
he
would
have
stated
such
theories
before
him
with
a
cynisism
like
that
he
quite
understood
that
a
man
might
commit
faults
he
even
excused
certain
crimes
and
he
excused
them
the
more
willingly
because
he
himself
had
been
guilty
of
them
but
he
did
not
understand
how
a
man
could
dare
to
talk
about
them
he
was
rather
of
that
class
of
persons
who
are
modest
in
words
but
not
in
deeds
who
are
offended
at
the
talk
while
they
delight
in
the
acts
we
hear
them
utter
cries
of
horror
and
indignation
at
the
slightest
equivocal
word
we
see
them
stop
their
ears
at
the
recital
of
a
racy
tale
chastely
cover
their
face
before
the
figure
of
the
callipygean
venus
treating
molière
as
obscene
and
rabelais
as
debauched
yet
out
of
sight
sheltered
by
the
curtains
of
the
alcove
they
love
to
strip
in
silence
some
lascivious
maritorne
and
cautiously
abandon
themselves
to
disgusting
orgies
with
phrynes
whom
they
chance
to
encounter
therefore
the
curé
of
althausen
was
offended
and
indignant
at
his
cynicism
who
had
so
crudely
broached
the
chapter
about
the
love
of
women
to
him
who
the
evening
before
had
abandoned
himself
to
all
the
furies
of
a
passion
in
the
arms
of
a
debauched
old
at
the
same
he
felt
that
his
brain
was
confused
and
that
he
was
gradually
losing
the
exact
idea
of
things
the
wine
he
had
drunk
was
more
than
he
was
accustomed
to
it
was
rising
to
his
head
and
he
was
becoming
intoxicated
well
said
ridoux
you
give
me
no
answer
and
you
stare
at
me
like
an
dog
what
answer
do
you
wish
me
to
give
you
except
that
i
believe
i
am
dreaming
in
truth
i
believe
i
am
dreaming
be
more
sincere
i
do
not
like
hypocrisy
you
talk
of
a
giddy
little
thing
i
know
no
giddy
thing
as
to
the
rest
i
have
not
quite
made
out
what
it
is
you
wanted
to
tell
me
i
think
that
you
have
intended
to
make
a
joke
about
your
old
women
ah
you
you
never
understand
anything
where
did
you
come
from
why
from
your
school
from
the
seminary
and
neither
you
nor
my
masters
taught
me
that
there
to
me
to
me
to
me
you
speak
in
such
a
manner
to
me
oh
clever
fox
well
you
are
sharper
than
i
am
cried
the
old
curé
striking
the
table
and
looking
at
marcel
with
astonishment
mingled
with
admiration
why
should
i
concern
myself
about
your
future
you
will
succeed
my
dear
fellow
you
will
succeed
oh
oh
you
are
a
master
a
like
i
can
not
teach
you
anything
jesus
mary
joseph
that
is
my
nephew
my
dear
old
ridoux
curé
of
nicholas
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
monsieur
le
curé
of
althausen
i
swear
you
will
become
a
bishop
monseigneur
i
drink
your
health
lxvii
in
a
glass
the
fumes
of
the
wine
were
working
in
my
veins
it
was
one
of
those
moments
of
intoxication
when
everything
one
sees
everything
one
hears
speaks
to
us
of
the
beloved
a
de
musset
enfant
du
they
conversed
for
a
long
time
still
and
they
drank
too
so
much
so
that
marcel
went
to
his
room
with
his
brain
charged
with
the
fumes
of
the
wine
he
opened
his
window
and
breathed
with
delight
the
fresh
air
of
night
while
he
gazed
on
the
stars
which
were
rising
slowly
in
the
sky
he
tried
to
analyze
the
new
sensation
which
he
experienced
how
a
few
mouthfuls
of
liquor
alter
a
man
he
said
to
himself
he
felt
himself
to
be
totally
different
and
he
allowed
his
thoughts
to
wander
in
an
ocean
of
delights
his
ardent
and
ecstatic
imagination
launched
itself
into
space
bright
unknown
worlds
rose
before
him
with
their
atmosphere
saturated
with
warmth
with
caresses
and
with
perfumes
he
saw
the
future
and
it
appeared
to
him
radiant
there
were
sons
without
number
and
feasts
without
end
the
entire
universe
belonged
to
him
he
flew
from
planet
to
planet
without
effort
or
fatigue
borne
by
a
mysterious
wing
into
the
fields
of
the
infinite
he
discovered
an
unknown
audacity
and
all
obstacles
subsided
before
his
powerful
will
no
more
barriers
no
more
bolts
no
more
doors
no
more
pretences
no
more
social
chains
no
more
terrible
father
no
more
suzanne
alone
remained
in
all
her
youthful
grace
and
her
chaste
nudity
for
after
having
wandered
in
boundless
space
it
was
towards
her
that
his
hopes
his
desires
his
aspirations
inclined
there
was
the
soul
and
the
body
happiness
and
life
sacred
symbolical
wedlock
the
chosen
vessel
the
nubile
maid
ready
for
the
husband
and
he
murmured
the
song
of
songs
let
her
kiss
me
with
kisses
of
her
mouth
for
her
teats
are
better
than
wine
and
it
was
at
the
very
moment
when
he
was
about
perhaps
to
be
able
to
taste
this
exquisite
cup
that
he
must
go
away
go
away
that
is
to
say
leave
her
she
who
had
just
cast
a
ray
into
his
life
go
away
to
obey
a
culpable
ambition
to
lose
for
ever
this
ravishing
young
girl
and
the
promises
which
he
had
made
to
himself
and
the
unsatisfied
desires
and
the
boundless
joys
the
delicious
troubles
the
sweet
evening
talks
the
hand
sometimes
squeezed
in
a
moment
of
audacity
of
all
that
but
the
memory
would
remain
of
all
the
intoxications
of
soul
of
heart
of
sense
of
all
those
joys
which
should
repay
him
for
his
wasted
youth
for
his
fair
years
lost
he
would
preserve
but
remorse
remorse
for
having
so
senselessly
let
them
go
and
all
at
once
in
the
whirlwind
of
his
ideas
he
seized
one
as
it
passed
by
he
noticed
during
the
day
the
captain
entering
the
for
vic
it
was
in
fact
the
time
at
which
he
drew
his
pay
he
could
not
return
till
the
following
day
suzanne
then
was
alone
with
the
old
she
went
to
bed
late
he
knew
perhaps
she
was
still
awake
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
not
yet
eleven
he
still
had
a
chance
of
seeing
her
he
cherished
this
idea
it
pleased
him
and
he
was
surprised
that
he
had
not
thought
of
it
before
yes
certainly
he
must
see
her
in
order
that
she
might
keep
the
remembrance
of
him
as
he
was
bearing
away
the
memory
of
her
what
would
be
more
delightful
than
to
say
to
himself
i
hold
the
thoughts
of
a
beautiful
young
girl
i
hold
her
simple
confidences
i
possess
the
treasure
of
her
sweet
secrets
and
although
there
would
never
be
between
her
and
him
but
the
pure
and
chaste
sympathy
of
two
souls
was
not
that
enough
was
not
that
a
compensation
sufficient
for
the
step
which
he
was
venturing
and
with
the
audacity
of
conception
and
the
temerity
of
conduct
of
a
man
on
the
border
of
intoxication
he
determined
to
put
his
fine
project
into
execution
immediately
his
sense
became
inflamed
the
more
he
thought
of
it
and
what
had
at
first
presented
itself
to
him
as
a
vague
desire
soon
became
firmly
fixed
in
his
brain
and
in
less
than
ten
seconds
he
had
conceived
the
plan
and
weighed
all
the
chances
he
decided
that
nothing
was
more
simple
and
that
the
only
serious
difficulty
was
to
get
out
of
the
house
without
being
heard
he
still
felt
a
few
scruples
he
poured
himself
out
a
glass
of
brandy
let
me
swallow
some
courage
he
said
what
a
singular
piece
of
machinery
is
man
who
imbibes
in
a
few
drops
of
liquid
the
dose
of
bravery
which
he
lacks
and
spirit
which
he
needs
and
in
fact
he
soon
felt
a
generous
warmth
which
ascended
to
his
head
and
his
heart
became
anew
surrounded
little
by
little
with
that
triple
breast
plate
of
brass
without
which
there
is
no
hero
he
listened
inside
and
out
all
sounds
were
hushed
in
the
parsonage
as
in
the
village
everybody
was
asleep
he
heard
only
the
croaking
of
a
legion
of
frogs
which
were
sporting
in
the
neighbouring
marsh
and
far
away
the
bark
of
some
the
night
was
splendid
the
moon
was
rising
behind
the
woods
that
was
a
serious
obstacle
but
are
there
any
serious
obstacles
for
a
man
by
drink
he
did
not
even
think
of
it
his
mind
was
cheerful
and
content
if
anyone
encountered
him
in
the
night
wandering
along
the
roads
what
could
they
say
had
he
not
a
perfect
right
like
anybody
else
to
take
the
fresh
air
of
evening
and
besides
might
he
not
have
been
summoned
by
a
sick
person
on
the
other
hand
no
more
favourable
moment
would
ever
present
itself
for
talking
with
suzanne
his
uncle
was
snoring
in
the
next
room
and
his
servant
supposing
she
was
still
awake
would
she
dare
while
there
was
a
guest
at
the
parsonage
to
come
and
assure
herself
if
he
was
in
his
bed
he
took
off
his
shoes
opened
the
door
noiselessly
and
glided
into
the
street
he
rapidly
went
round
the
parsonage
and
he
put
on
his
shoes
again
only
when
he
was
at
some
distance
under
the
discreet
shade
of
the
limes
then
he
walked
boldly
on
keeping
to
the
middle
of
the
road
on
the
side
however
where
the
houses
cast
their
shadow
and
advanced
with
the
step
of
a
man
who
is
going
to
accomplish
a
duty
he
arrived
without
any
hindrance
at
the
captain
house
it
was
fully
lighted
up
by
the
pale
and
all
the
shutters
were
closed
consequently
the
side
looking
upon
the
garden
was
in
the
shadow
and
there
was
suzanne
room
the
room
hung
with
rose
so
he
pursued
his
way
at
a
rapid
pace
entered
the
little
path
bordered
with
hawthorn
and
soon
reached
the
clump
of
old
lxviii
the
rose
chamber
they
are
women
already
they
were
so
when
they
were
born
but
one
guesses
them
so
still
one
reads
it
in
their
little
thought
one
comes
across
an
end
of
thread
here
and
there
which
is
like
a
revelation
they
are
but
forgive
me
young
ladies
i
am
afraid
of
going
too
far
droz
what
man
is
there
who
has
not
experienced
a
delicious
emotion
on
entering
for
the
first
time
a
young
girl
room
who
has
not
breathed
with
voluptuous
delight
its
sweet
and
chaste
perfumes
and
felt
his
heart
soften
in
its
fresh
and
fragrant
atmosphere
how
pretty
neat
and
harmonious
is
everything
there
the
most
insignificant
objects
the
most
common
articles
of
furniture
have
a
mysterious
and
secret
aspect
there
which
makes
one
dream
one
contemplates
with
transport
all
those
nothings
all
those
little
trifles
all
those
trinkets
which
young
girls
delight
in
and
because
they
have
been
touched
by
a
white
hand
they
appear
clothed
in
enchanting
colours
the
fairy
who
lodges
in
this
place
has
left
a
of
herself
on
all
which
surrounds
her
and
transforms
all
into
jewels
even
the
least
pin
but
that
which
above
all
else
arrests
the
gaze
that
which
drives
the
blood
to
the
head
and
causes
the
heart
to
beat
is
the
bed
the
young
girl
bed
the
sanctuary
the
delicious
nest
of
love
there
is
the
pillow
on
which
her
head
reposes
and
then
the
question
comes
what
passes
in
the
young
head
when
softly
leaning
on
the
warm
down
she
lets
her
thoughts
travel
into
the
land
of
dreams
when
slumber
soft
on
all
around
thee
is
outpoured
oh
pepita
charming
maid
my
love
of
what
thou
here
is
the
place
of
her
body
yes
it
is
there
beneath
the
discreet
that
she
hides
her
naked
charms
and
we
begin
to
dream
as
well
and
we
say
to
ourselves
that
we
would
give
much
to
be
able
to
penetrate
into
this
sanctuary
at
the
hour
when
the
divinity
is
going
to
bed
happy
gyges
lend
me
your
ring
that
i
may
assist
mutely
and
invisibly
at
the
sweet
mysteries
of
the
night
toilette
she
is
here
she
has
given
and
received
the
evening
kiss
sleep
well
her
father
and
mother
have
said
and
the
child
replies
oh
yes
i
am
very
sleepy
then
she
quickly
shuts
the
door
and
breathes
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
she
is
in
her
own
room
she
is
alone
alone
do
you
believe
it
if
so
you
would
be
greatly
mistaken
for
this
is
the
time
when
she
receives
her
own
visitors
and
often
there
is
a
numerous
company
oh
be
reassured
these
guests
will
not
be
able
to
compromise
her
they
are
secret
silent
and
invisible
for
all
else
but
her
she
alone
sees
them
talks
to
them
and
listens
to
them
it
is
at
the
summons
of
her
thought
that
they
hasten
there
passive
and
obedient
then
she
passes
them
in
review
one
by
one
she
examines
them
from
head
to
foot
she
clothes
and
unclothes
them
at
her
will
never
has
a
captain
of
infantry
under
orders
for
parade
made
a
more
minute
inspection
of
his
conscripts
sometimes
they
come
all
in
a
crowd
giving
themselves
up
with
her
in
the
mysterious
comers
of
her
imagination
to
the
wildest
frolics
young
people
with
a
stiff
collar
beardless
sublieutenants
coxcombs
with
red
hands
swells
with
white
cuffs
little
heads
of
wax
and
little
souls
of
cardboard
run
up
ran
up
ye
pretty
puppets
dance
my
loves
you
are
but
dolls
and
she
makes
them
dance
on
every
cord
and
every
tune
but
soon
the
figures
are
effaced
and
blend
into
one
the
pomatumed
band
disappear
into
space
whence
there
rises
clearly
the
image
of
the
chosen
one
he
is
young
he
is
dark
or
fair
she
has
seen
him
she
looked
at
him
he
smiled
at
her
he
thinks
her
pretty
is
she
then
always
pretty
and
quickly
she
goes
to
her
mirror
heavens
how
badly
her
hair
is
done
how
badly
that
ribbon
sets
if
she
had
put
it
in
another
place
and
that
little
wandering
lock
decidedly
it
must
set
off
that
perhaps
he
would
like
me
better
if
instead
of
plaits
i
had
curls
and
if
instead
of
the
brown
dress
i
put
on
the
blue
he
who
is
he
he
is
the
imaginary
lover
the
handsome
young
man
whom
she
has
met
in
the
street
he
who
turned
round
to
look
at
her
or
the
one
who
was
so
charming
at
the
last
ball
or
again
the
one
who
has
just
passed
the
window
who
is
he
does
she
know
it
is
the
one
she
is
waiting
for
the
first
who
presents
himself
who
is
young
intelligent
and
what
does
the
rest
matter
provided
he
possesses
all
these
qualities
and
all
these
qualities
he
must
possess
often
she
has
never
even
seen
him
but
he
is
charming
and
she
feels
that
she
loves
him
already
and
there
are
the
brilliant
displays
of
the
future
appearing
the
enchanted
palaces
which
are
built
out
of
the
chapters
of
novels
which
never
will
be
finished
and
thus
every
evening
wild
adventures
in
the
young
brain
intrigues
in
embryo
meetings
full
of
mystery
delightful
terrors
with
phantom
lovers
until
at
length
a
very
palpable
one
presents
himself
and
comes
and
knocks
at
the
door
of
reality
sometimes
he
is
very
far
from
the
cherished
dream
he
is
neither
young
nor
handsome
nor
rich
nor
intelligent
she
rather
makes
a
face
but
she
ends
by
taking
him
it
is
a
man
and
meanwhile
mamma
has
said
as
she
kisses
her
daughter
forehead
sleep
well
my
daughter
and
she
murmurs
to
papa
what
an
angel
of
candour
lxix
the
gust
of
wind
i
turned
my
eyes
instinctively
towards
the
lighted
window
and
through
the
curtains
which
were
drawn
i
distinctly
caught
sight
of
a
woman
dressed
in
white
with
her
hair
undone
and
moving
like
one
who
knows
that
she
is
alone
droz
madame
et
suzanne
room
but
why
should
i
describe
the
room
let
me
describe
suzanne
to
you
at
this
secret
hour
i
am
sure
that
you
would
prefer
me
to
do
so
the
young
people
who
read
this
will
do
well
to
skip
this
chapter
it
interests
the
men
alone
like
the
preacher
who
one
day
turned
the
women
out
of
church
as
he
wanted
to
keep
the
men
only
i
warn
young
ladies
that
these
lines
may
shock
suzanne
was
preparing
to
go
to
bed
to
go
to
bed
that
is
not
done
quickly
you
have
mesdames
so
many
little
things
to
do
before
going
to
bed
so
suzanne
was
going
to
and
fro
in
her
small
room
attending
to
all
these
little
details
she
was
in
a
short
petticoat
with
her
legs
and
arms
bare
and
her
little
feet
in
slippers
i
warned
you
that
i
had
borrowed
the
ring
of
gyges
and
i
can
tell
you
that
i
saw
her
calf
and
right
above
the
knee
and
all
was
like
a
sculptor
model
beneath
the
thin
cambric
her
budding
bosom
rose
and
fell
marking
a
voluptuous
valley
on
which
like
the
lover
one
would
never
be
weary
to
let
one
kisses
wander
but
on
seeing
the
white
plump
shoulders
the
graceful
throat
and
the
neck
on
which
was
twisted
a
mass
of
little
brown
curls
and
the
back
of
velvet
which
had
no
other
covering
than
the
thick
rolls
of
hair
and
the
delicate
hips
which
the
little
petticoat
closely
pressed
one
asked
oneself
where
the
kisses
would
run
on
for
the
longest
time
she
was
delicious
like
this
and
under
every
aspect
and
undoubtedly
she
knew
it
for
every
time
she
passed
before
the
large
glass
of
her
wardrobe
she
looked
at
herself
in
it
and
smiled
and
she
was
quite
right
for
it
was
indeed
the
sweetest
of
sights
a
pretty
woman
is
never
insensible
to
the
sight
of
her
own
charms
see
therefore
what
a
love
they
have
for
mirrors
habit
which
palls
in
so
many
things
never
palls
in
this
for
her
it
is
a
sight
always
charming
and
always
fresh
very
different
to
the
forgetful
lover
or
the
sated
husband
whose
eyes
and
senses
are
so
quickly
habituated
she
never
grows
weary
of
finding
out
that
she
is
pretty
and
making
herself
so
in
truth
a
constant
homage
earnest
and
conscientious
suzanne
then
examined
herself
full
face
in
profile
in
view
and
behind
attentively
and
conscientiously
like
an
amateur
judging
a
work
of
art
who
cries
at
length
yes
it
is
all
good
it
is
all
perfect
there
is
nothing
amiss
one
could
have
believed
that
she
saw
herself
again
for
the
first
time
after
many
years
at
length
when
the
survey
was
completed
and
the
toilette
finished
she
let
her
petticoat
slip
down
opened
her
bed
put
one
knee
upon
it
and
the
upper
part
of
her
body
leaning
forward
on
her
hands
prepared
to
get
in
the
lamp
on
the
close
beside
her
threw
its
light
no
longer
on
her
face
but
at
the
same
instant
a
little
zephyr
taking
her
astern
caused
the
white
tissue
which
never
mention
to
gently
undulate
she
noticed
then
that
she
had
forgotten
to
shut
her
window
heavens
cried
marcel
to
himself
for
it
was
he
who
perched
on
the
rise
of
the
road
and
armed
with
his
good
had
just
been
witness
of
what
i
have
narrated
lxx
the
ambuscade
be
not
discouraged
either
before
obstacles
or
before
wait
patiently
the
sacred
hour
will
sound
for
you
and
all
the
ways
will
be
made
smooth
of
mgr
de
drawing
near
to
the
window
suzanne
distinguished
in
front
of
her
behind
the
palisade
a
dark
motionless
figure
she
immediately
recognized
the
curé
alarmed
and
trembling
she
hastily
drew
back
but
she
heard
a
gentle
cough
as
if
someone
was
calling
and
was
afraid
of
being
surprised
what
is
happening
she
said
to
herself
what
is
he
doing
there
she
covered
herself
hurriedly
with
a
and
drew
near
the
casement
again
marcel
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
bowed
to
her
and
appeared
to
invite
her
by
a
sign
to
come
down
again
she
drew
back
she
knew
not
what
to
think
or
what
to
do
she
hesitated
to
comply
with
the
priest
desire
and
on
the
other
hand
she
was
afraid
lest
marianne
or
some
neighbour
should
happen
to
wake
and
catch
the
curé
of
the
village
making
signs
at
that
unseasonable
hour
before
her
door
during
her
father
absence
god
only
knew
what
a
scandal
there
would
be
then
and
as
tongues
would
wag
her
father
perhaps
might
hear
of
it
and
what
explanation
could
she
give
already
they
were
beginning
to
chatter
about
her
absence
from
the
services
and
their
meetings
on
the
road
she
was
seized
with
terror
and
ran
to
put
out
the
lamp
calculating
that
the
curé
would
withdraw
but
the
curé
of
althausen
had
not
undertaken
this
adventurous
expedition
to
abandon
it
at
the
moment
when
he
was
attaining
his
object
excited
by
the
alcohol
by
the
dishabille
of
the
charming
young
girl
and
by
all
that
he
had
just
caught
a
sight
of
emboldened
by
the
night
and
the
solitary
place
he
was
waiting
with
impatience
therefore
when
suzanne
trembling
all
over
drew
near
a
second
time
to
see
if
he
was
gone
he
was
at
the
same
place
still
bowing
to
her
and
calling
her
by
signs
he
was
not
tired
and
with
perfectly
clerical
obstinacy
multiplied
his
salutes
and
his
signs
she
said
to
herself
that
there
was
doubtless
some
important
motive
for
him
to
have
decided
in
spite
of
dangers
and
the
proprieties
to
require
an
interview
with
her
in
the
middle
of
the
night
good
god
could
some
misfortune
have
happened
to
my
father
the
thought
oppressed
her
mind
she
hesitated
no
longer
put
on
a
light
petticoat
threw
a
shawl
over
her
shoulders
and
went
downstairs
lxxi
the
breach
who
art
thou
who
knockest
so
loudly
art
thou
great
love
to
whom
all
must
yield
for
whom
heroes
sacrificed
more
than
life
their
very
heart
ah
if
thou
art
he
let
the
door
be
opened
wide
michelet
she
saw
at
once
that
he
was
all
in
a
fever
what
has
happened
she
said
you
have
seen
my
father
nothing
has
happened
mademoiselle
as
to
your
father
i
saw
him
this
morning
getting
into
a
carriage
i
believe
that
he
is
well
but
what
is
it
then
what
is
it
do
not
hide
anything
from
me
i
am
hiding
nothing
from
you
mademoiselle
nothing
grievous
has
happened
be
comforted
i
was
passing
by
in
my
walk
i
saw
the
light
i
observed
you
your
window
was
partly
open
i
stopped
and
said
to
myself
perhaps
i
can
make
a
sign
to
mademoiselle
durand
that
i
am
going
away
oh
heavens
i
am
trembling
all
over
what
you
are
going
away
and
where
and
when
morning
mademoiselle
after
mass
for
ever
perhaps
you
are
leaving
althausen
so
without
saying
to
your
parishioners
to
your
friends
i
have
no
friends
mademoiselle
i
have
only
you
who
are
willing
to
hear
me
some
friendship
only
you
who
have
sometimes
thought
of
the
poor
solitary
at
the
parsonage
therefore
i
thank
you
for
it
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
and
i
wanted
to
bid
you
farewell
but
why
this
sudden
and
unexpected
departure
a
more
important
cure
is
offered
me
mademoiselle
and
i
have
like
others
a
little
grain
of
ambition
oh
i
understand
monsieur
and
let
me
congratulate
you
on
this
change
in
your
fortune
is
it
far
nancy
mademoiselle
nancy
i
am
glad
of
it
on
your
account
you
will
have
distractions
there
which
you
have
not
here
i
almost
envy
you
do
not
envy
me
mademoiselle
for
i
carry
away
death
in
my
soul
i
am
sorrowful
as
christ
at
golgotha
i
spoke
to
you
of
ambition
it
is
false
i
have
no
ambition
other
motives
than
miserable
calculations
compel
me
to
depart
motives
serious
you
will
understand
them
mademoiselle
for
i
must
confess
it
to
you
and
that
i
should
not
do
if
i
was
to
remain
in
this
parish
but
from
the
day
i
saw
you
i
have
felt
myself
drawn
towards
you
by
an
invincible
sympathy
oh
be
not
disturbed
let
not
my
words
offend
you
it
is
the
fondness
which
i
should
have
felt
for
a
sister
if
god
had
given
me
one
believe
it
truly
mademoiselle
the
spotless
calyx
of
the
lily
the
emblem
of
purity
is
not
more
chaste
than
my
thoughts
when
they
fly
towards
you
for
when
i
think
of
you
i
think
of
the
queen
of
angels
that
is
why
i
wished
to
see
you
again
and
bid
you
farewell
i
thank
you
sir
i
wished
to
say
to
you
farewell
i
go
away
but
tell
me
not
if
i
may
ask
to
see
you
sometimes
again
i
dare
not
ask
so
great
a
favour
but
if
i
shall
have
the
right
to
mingle
my
memory
with
yours
my
thought
with
your
thought
tell
me
if
you
wish
me
to
remain
your
friend
though
far
away
we
leave
one
another
we
separate
but
is
that
a
reason
why
all
should
end
may
we
not
write
give
one
another
advice
follow
one
another
from
afar
on
the
arduous
road
of
life
it
is
so
sweet
when
we
are
alone
when
the
heart
is
sad
when
the
heaven
is
dark
and
the
tears
come
slowly
to
the
eyes
to
dream
that
away
there
in
a
little
corner
behind
the
horizon
there
is
a
to
our
soul
which
perhaps
at
that
very
moment
leaps
towards
us
also
and
murmurs
across
space
friend
i
think
of
you
we
feel
less
abandoned
and
less
alone
yes
that
is
true
i
understand
you
it
is
the
communion
of
souls
dear
suzanne
sweeter
than
all
the
pleasures
of
the
body
because
it
is
holy
and
pure
it
is
the
ark
of
the
covenant
the
gate
of
heaven
tell
me
will
you
are
you
willing
that
we
should
follow
one
another
thus
in
life
you
do
not
answer
listen
sir
listen
there
is
someone
in
the
road
there
are
footsteps
said
marcel
after
he
had
listened
yes
there
are
footsteps
someone
comes
i
must
not
be
seen
here
farewell
mademoiselle
farewell
do
not
go
away
that
would
be
the
means
of
compromising
us
both
for
they
must
have
heard
our
voices
and
your
departure
would
attract
suspicions
what
shall
i
do
i
can
not
remain
here
they
can
not
have
seen
us
yet
come
in
under
this
arbour
you
will
be
safe
from
any
gaze
what
said
marcel
you
wish
i
beseech
you
come
this
village
is
full
of
people
it
is
more
prudent
for
both
of
us
she
turned
the
key
and
marcel
glided
like
a
shadow
through
the
gate
quickly
crossed
the
borders
and
threw
himself
under
the
arbour
suzanne
closed
the
gate
again
and
rejoined
him
lxxii
the
assault
be
mine
be
my
sister
for
i
am
all
thine
and
well
i
deserve
thee
for
long
have
i
loved
a
de
vigny
they
were
standing
up
under
the
dark
arbour
one
close
to
the
other
excited
panting
they
could
scarce
get
their
breath
again
does
their
heart
beat
so
hard
because
there
is
someone
in
the
path
silence
the
cricket
just
by
their
side
sends
forth
from
under
the
grass
his
soft
monotonous
cry
and
down
there
in
the
neighbouring
ditch
the
toad
lifts
his
harsh
voice
silence
a
noise
in
the
road
faint
at
first
as
the
murmur
of
the
wind
increases
it
comes
near
it
is
the
cautious
hesitating
step
of
someone
listening
it
comes
nearer
and
stops
silence
the
philosopher
cricket
continues
his
song
the
amorous
toad
his
poem
behind
the
branches
of
honeysuckle
they
watch
attentively
and
can
see
without
being
seen
a
shadow
passes
slowly
by
with
its
head
turned
towards
the
dark
arbour
suzanne
made
a
movement
of
surprise
your
servant
she
said
silence
murmured
marcel
and
he
seizes
a
hand
which
he
keeps
within
his
own
veronica
slowly
walked
on
when
she
reached
the
gate
she
pushed
it
as
if
to
assure
herself
if
it
was
open
well
there
is
an
impertinence
said
suzanne
who
can
have
made
her
suspect
that
you
were
here
marcel
for
reply
pressed
the
hand
which
he
was
holding
finding
the
gate
closed
the
servant
continued
her
road
then
all
at
once
returned
stopped
for
a
few
seconds
facing
the
arbour
and
at
length
disappeared
behind
the
they
followed
the
sound
of
her
footsteps
which
was
soon
lost
in
the
silence
and
found
themselves
alone
hearing
nothing
but
the
beatings
of
their
own
heart
let
us
remain
said
suzanne
in
a
low
voice
we
must
not
go
out
yet
really
that
is
the
most
impertinent
creature
i
have
ever
seen
by
what
right
does
she
spy
on
you
thus
dear
child
do
you
not
know
that
these
old
servants
are
on
the
track
of
every
scandal
jealous
of
all
beauty
and
all
virtue
she
will
have
noticed
our
frequent
interviews
and
has
imagined
a
world
of
iniquities
nevertheless
i
bless
her
yes
i
bless
her
since
i
owe
to
her
the
joy
of
finding
myself
in
this
with
you
see
dear
child
how
strange
is
destiny
which
is
none
other
but
the
hand
of
god
for
we
must
be
blind
not
to
recognize
in
all
these
things
the
finger
of
divine
providence
it
is
precisely
the
efforts
made
to
put
an
obstacle
between
us
to
prevent
us
me
from
fulfilling
my
duties
of
a
pastor
you
those
of
a
christian
which
have
been
the
cause
of
our
sweet
intimacy
your
father
forbids
you
to
assist
at
the
holy
sacrifice
and
you
come
to
me
to
ask
for
counsel
this
servant
pursues
us
with
her
envious
hate
and
obliges
us
to
take
refuge
like
guilty
lovers
beneath
this
dark
arbour
almighty
god
thanks
thanks
but
what
a
strange
situation
if
anyone
were
to
surprise
us
the
whole
world
would
accuse
us
and
yet
what
is
surer
than
our
conscience
you
see
plainly
dear
child
that
we
can
not
separate
thus
and
that
whatever
happens
we
must
not
remain
strangers
to
one
another
suzanne
did
not
answer
and
he
emboldened
by
this
silence
pressed
between
his
the
hand
which
she
abandoned
to
him
i
was
so
much
accustomed
to
see
you
in
our
church
that
when
you
ceased
to
come
there
it
seemed
to
me
that
everything
was
in
mourning
you
were
the
most
charming
and
the
chastest
ornament
of
it
when
i
went
up
into
the
pulpit
it
was
for
you
that
i
preached
and
when
i
turned
towards
my
flock
to
bless
them
it
was
you
alone
sweet
lamb
that
i
blessed
in
the
name
of
the
father
you
understand
now
why
i
shall
go
away
enveloped
in
sorrow
but
sir
i
do
not
deserve
the
honour
which
you
do
me
and
i
am
unworthy
to
occupy
your
thoughts
in
this
way
do
not
say
that
for
since
i
have
seen
you
you
have
become
without
my
knowing
how
the
joy
of
my
life
the
source
from
which
i
draw
my
sweetest
and
most
holy
pleasures
with
the
memory
of
you
i
lull
myself
in
the
infinite
i
see
heaven
and
the
angels
i
dream
of
seraphims
who
resemble
you
who
bear
me
on
their
diaphanous
wings
into
the
abode
where
all
is
joy
and
love
heavenly
love
dear
suzanne
love
like
that
of
the
angels
for
the
virgin
the
mother
eternally
pure
of
our
sweet
saviour
you
see
you
have
no
reasons
to
be
offended
with
my
dreams
you
are
not
offended
at
them
are
you
why
should
i
be
offended
at
them
said
suzanne
softly
can
one
be
offended
with
dreams
you
remember
that
night
when
alone
as
we
are
now
i
allowed
myself
in
a
moment
of
pious
transport
to
bear
to
my
lips
your
lovely
hand
i
have
often
blushed
at
it
i
have
blushed
at
it
because
i
thought
that
you
might
have
mistaken
that
respectful
kiss
i
kissed
it
as
i
should
have
kissed
the
hem
of
a
queen
robe
if
that
queen
had
been
a
saint
as
i
should
have
kissed
the
feet
of
the
virgin
as
magdalena
kissed
those
of
christ
as
i
kiss
it
at
this
moment
dear
dear
suzanne
and
his
lips
rested
on
that
little
warm
quivering
feverish
hand
and
they
could
no
more
be
separated
from
it
and
when
at
length
he
withdrew
his
mouth
from
it
he
found
that
suzanne
was
so
near
to
him
that
he
heard
the
beatings
of
her
heart
leave
me
said
the
imprudent
girl
i
entreat
you
leave
me
oh
why
are
you
doing
that
and
she
tried
with
vain
efforts
to
loosen
herself
from
the
embrace
but
he
murmured
softly
leave
you
oh
never
you
shall
be
my
companion
in
life
as
you
are
my
betrothed
before
the
eternal
leave
you
dear
suzanne
sweet
mystic
rose
chosen
vessel
see
there
is
something
stronger
than
all
the
laws
and
all
the
proprieties
it
is
a
look
from
you
why
do
you
repulse
me
i
speak
to
you
as
to
the
virgin
and
i
kiss
your
knees
chaste
betrothed
of
the
levite
let
me
espouse
you
before
god
she
struggled
with
all
her
might
excited
and
maddened
but
what
can
the
dove
do
in
the
talons
of
the
hawk
pressed
to
his
breast
by
his
vigorous
arms
it
was
in
vain
that
she
asked
for
pity
hell
might
have
opened
ere
he
would
have
dropped
his
prey
the
struggle
lasted
several
minutes
passionate
silent
ardent
woman
is
weak
soon
nothing
was
heard
a
sob
and
all
died
away
in
the
dense
shade
the
startled
cricket
was
silent
and
it
alone
might
have
counted
the
sighs
while
in
the
neighbouring
ditch
the
toad
unwearied
continued
its

reached
the
parsonage
without
hindrance
veronica
had
not
yet
returned
he
congratulated
himself
on
that
and
went
up
the
which
led
to
his
room
with
the
light
step
of
a
happy
man
locked
his
door
and
began
to
laugh
like
a
madman
everything
was
safe
only
there
was
down
there
in
a
corner
of
the
village
an
honour
lost
is
it
really
you
marcel
is
it
really
you
he
said
who
have
just
played
so
great
a
game
and
won
the
trick
and
he
laughed
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
he
would
willingly
have
danced
a
wild
saraband
if
he
had
not
been
afraid
of
making
a
noise
he
listened
in
the
next
room
where
his
uncle
was
in
bed
and
heard
his
loud
breathing
and
the
hag
who
is
watching
still
beneath
the
limes
and
the
father
who
is
at
vic
and
who
i
doubt
not
is
snoring
too
come
all
goes
well
all
goes
well
but
he
stopped
ashamed
of
himself
decidedly
he
said
to
himself
i
have
become
in
a
few
days
utterly
bad
i
did
not
believe
that
it
was
possible
to
make
such
rapid
progress
in
evil
but
nonsense
is
it
evil
has
not
god
made
wine
to
be
drunk
flowers
to
be
plucked
and
women
to
be
loved
as
to
that
old
soldier
why
should
i
feel
any
pity
on
his
account
he
has
been
insolent
he
has
detested
me
without
my
ever
having
done
anything
to
him
i
have
loved
his
daughter
his
daughter
has
loved
me
we
are
quits
i
do
not
see
why
i
should
distress
myself
about
an
adventure
which
would
make
so
many
people
happy
and
for
which
all
my
brethren
would
have
very
quickly
sold
the
sacred
host
and
the
holy
pyx
besides
ah
my
dear
uncle
good
father
ridoux
sleep
sleep
in
peace
how
greatly
am
i
your
debtor
for
what
you
have
done
for
me
unwittingly
and
in
spite
of
yourself
for
have
you
not
by
urging
me
to
drink
more
than
is
my
custom
in
order
to
draw
my
secret
from
me
given
me
the
courage
to
undertake
what
i
should
never
have
dared
to
dream
of
fortuna
oh
providence
providence
she
is
mine
the
girl
with
the
dark
eyes
is
mine
he
heard
a
slight
noise
in
the
corridor
good
never
comes
alone
he
continued
it
always
has
evil
for
an
escort
behind
the
sweet
form
of
the
angel
the
grinning
face
of
satan
he
is
coming
upstairs
and
knocks
at
the
door
he
had
not
lighted
his
lamp
again
and
he
carefully
refrained
from
answering
he
heard
veronica
trying
to
open
the
door
and
calling
him
in
a
low
voice
but
he
pretended
to
be
deaf
and
quietly
got
into
bed
all
the
while
cursing
his
accomplice
and
thinking
of
the
clumsy
trap
into
which
he
had
fallen
like
a
fool
and
of
that
thick
and
filthy
spider
web
where
like
an
unwary
and
silly
fly
he
had
daubed
his
wings
what
a
difference
between
the
chaste
resistance
of
suzanne
her
tears
and
her
defeat
and
the
hideous
advances
of
that
old
courtesan
of
the
sacristy
in
place
of
that
unclean
creature
accomplished
in
crime
oozing
hypocrisy
from
every
pore
he
had
an
adorable
loving
charming
mistress
such
as
he
had
never
dared
to
dream
of
and
all
this
alteration
in
a
few
hours
because
he
had
faced
it
out
because
excited
by
intoxication
he
had
taken
his
courage
in
both
hands
and
because
he
had
dared
oh
why
had
he
not
dared
ere
this
he
would
not
be
under
the
infamous
yoke
of
his
servant
and
how
many
priests
he
said
to
himself
for
want
of
a
little
boldness
are
devoted
to
a
degrading
concubinage
with
faded
old
spinsters
he
was
not
without
uneasiness
how
could
he
see
suzanne
again
situated
as
he
was
between
the
jealous
watching
of
the
servant
and
the
vigilance
of
the
father
and
above
all
how
could
he
discard
his
uncle
entreaties
and
refuse
an
unexpected
promotion
without
arousing
suspicion
in
high
quarters
for
more
than
ever
he
wished
to
remain
at
althausen
and
keep
the
treasure
which
had
just
caused
him
so
much
anxiety
yes
he
saw
them
accumulating
on
his
head
swooping
from
all
parts
and
under
all
aspects
veronica
durand
ridoux
the
bishop
the
gossips
scandal
dishonour
but
after
all
what
did
it
matter
to
him
the
essential
is
that
he
was
in
possession
of
suzanne
that
suzanne
was
his
that
he
had
the
most
charming
of
mistresses
and
he
was
indifferent
to
all
the
rest
to
see
her
again
readily
and
without
danger
to
contrive
other
interviews
and
above
all
to
act
prudently
was
what
he
must
think
of
the
chief
step
was
taken
the
rest
would
come
of
its
own
accord
with
suzanne
consent
all
obstacles
could
be
smoothed
away
and
clever
is
he
who
succeeds
in
barring
the
way
to
two
lovers
who
are
determined
to
see
one
another
again
the
old
counsellor
lamblin

in

capacity
of

was
aware
of

there
it
was
on
this
indeed
that
marcel
calculated
and
smiling
he
slept
the
sleep
of
the
just
and
dreamed
the
most
rosy
dreams
lxxiv
before
mass
you
think
that
we
ought
not
to
break
in
two
this
puppet
which
is
called

sit
upon
it

a
loud
and
voice
roused
him
unpleasantly
from
his
dreams
well
well
still
in
bed
when
the
sun
is
risen
you
are
not
thinking
then
of
going
away
you
go
to
bed
the
first
and
you
get
up
the
last
i
a
poor
old
invalid
am
giving
you
an
example
of
activity
ah
young
people
young
people
you
are
not
equal
to
us
come
come
you
can
rub
your
eyes
get
up
get
up
how
early
you
are
my
dear
uncle
my
mass
has
not
yet
rang
have
you
no
preparations
to
make
for
departure
for
departure
is
it
for
then
do
you
wish
to
put
it
off
to
the
greek
kalends
repeated
marcel
i
did
not
think
really
that
it
was
so
soon
he
dressed
with
the
prudent
delays
of
a
man
who
says
to
himself
let
us
see
let
us
consider
carefully
what
we
must
do
you
do
look
satisfied
resumed
ridoux
i
bring
you
honour
fortune
and
success
and
you
look
sulky
honour
fortune
and
success
those
are
very
fine
words
it
is
with
fine
words
that
we
do
fine
things
and
one
of
them
is
it
appears
to
unmoor
you
from
this
place
the
fact
is
replied
marcel
that
i
have
reflected
and
after
well
considering
everything
i
am
perfectly
well
off
and
have
no
desire
to
go
away
to
be
worse
off
elsewhere
hey
what
do
you
say
my
parish
humble
as
it
is
is
not
so
bad
as
you
think
the
people
are
simple
kind
and
affable
i
love
peace
and
tranquillity
and
i
tell
you
between
ourselves
that
to
be
curé
in
a
large
town
has
no
attractions
for
me
what
stuff
are
you
telling
me
now
your
town
curés
are
full
of
meanness
and
intrigues
the
little
i
have
seen
of
them
has
disgusted
me
for
ever
they
spy
one
upon
another
it
is
who
shall
prejudice
a
in
order
to
supplant
him
or
play
the
zealot
in
monseigneur
presence
when
i
was
the
bishop
secretary
hardly
a
day
passed
without
my
being
witness
to
some
shameful
piece
of
tale
bearing
you
must
weigh
all
your
words
cover
your
looks
and
have
a
care
even
of
your
gestures
the
slightest
imprudence
is
immediately
commented
on
exaggerated
embellished
and
retailed
at
the
vicar
general
is
the
spy
in
general
marcel
uttered
the
truth
the
position
of
the
priest
is
a
difficult
one
he
is
surrounded
with
the
malevolence
of
enemies
but
the
priest
chief
enemy
is
the
priest
as
a
body
they
march
together
close
compact
disciplined
defending
their
rights
and
the
honour
of
the
flag
resenting
individually
the
insults
offered
to
all
and
all
rejoicing
at
the
success
of
each
as
individuals
they
spy
on
one
another
are
jealous
of
one
another
fight
accuse
and
judge
one
another
and
they
do
all
this
hypocritically
and
by
occult
ways
these
hatreds
and
intrigues
do
not
go
outside
the
sanctuary
domains
it
is
a
strange
world
which
stirs
within
our
world
a
society
within
a
society
a
state
within
the
state
it
is
the
of
the
temple
and
it
stretches
from
the
sacristy
to
the
parsonage
from
the
parsonage
to
the
palace
the
profane
world
suspects
nothing
it
passes
unconcernedly
by
without
dreaming
that
tempests
are
rumbling
by
its
side
but
like
the
revolutions
raised
by
the
eunuchs
of
the
seraglio
the
intrigues
of
the
sacristy
have
been
known
to
change
the
face
of
nations
the
priest
is
the
spy
upon
the
priest
misfortune
to
the
cassock
which
unbuttons
itself
before
another
cassock
the
old
priests
are
aware
of
this
and
when
they
are
among
themselves
they
draw
the
folds
of
their
black
robe
close
carefully
hiding
the
least
opening
but
the
young
ones
simple
and
unreserved
often
let
themselves
be
taken
they
sound
them
and
turn
them
up
and
soon
know
what
they
have
underneath
in
order
to
please
monseigneur
and
to
deserve
the
good
graces
of
the
palace
there
are
few
priests
who
resist
the
temptation
to
sell
their
and
are
not
ready
to
deny
jesus
like
peter
the
good
apostle
the
first
and
the
model
of
the
roman
pontiffs
three
times
before
that
is
to
say
before
monseigneur
gets
up
no
that
will
not
do
for
me
added
marcel
if
i
am
poor
here
at
least
i
am
free
pshaw
you
did
not
raise
all
those
objections
to
me
yesterday
i
have
reflected
my
dear
uncle
as
i
have
had
the
honour
of
telling
you
your
reflections
are
fine
well
whether
you
have
reflected
or
not
is
all
the
same
to
me
i
have
taken
it
into
my
head
that
you
should
go
and
you
shall
go
i
will
make
you
happy
in
spite
of
yourself
for
i
have
reflected
also
and
more
than
ever
i
said
to
myself
that
you
most
go
do
you
want
me
to
enumerate
the
reasons
the
same
as
yesterday
i
have
no
doubt
no
there
is
one
more
and
that
is
worth
all
the
rest
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
to
me
but
i
have
my
answer
all
ready
speak
what
at
your
age
in
your
position
are
you
not
ashamed
to
fall
into
errors
which
would
scarcely
be
pardonable
in
a
seminarist
ah
you
want
the
dots
on
the
i
well
i
am
going
to
place
them
place
them
uncle
place
them
had
you
not
enough
girls
then
in
the
village
without
going
to
lay
a
claim
on
the
one
yonder
on
a
young
lady
whose
fall
will
cause
a
scandal
the
daughter
of
an
enemy
of
a
voltairian
almost
a
radical
a
in
fine
who
will
be
happy
to
seize
the
occasion
to
raise
a
terrible
outcry
and
to
proclaim
your
conduct
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
horizon
you
see
i
know
all
and
who
has
informed
you
so
correctly
i
know
all
i
tell
you
you
can
therefore
keep
your
temper
will
you
act
like
the
curé
of
larriques
what
is
there
in
common
between
the
curé
of
larriques
and
me
you
ought
to
humble
yourself
before
god
if
you
wanted
a
young
girl
if
your
immoderate
appetites
were
not
satisfied
with
what
you
had
under
your
nose
is
there
no
cautious
person
in
the
village
who
would
have
been
proud
and
happy
to
be
of
service
to
you
and
whom
you
could
have
married
to
some
clodhopper
or
to
some
chrysostom
ready
for
the
opportunity
whilst
that
one
whom
will
you
give
her
to
there
will
be
an
uproar
i
tell
you
and
that
will
be
abomination
really
uncle
said
marcel
pale
with
anger
if
anyone
heard
us
would
they
believe
that
they
were
listening
to
the
conversation
of
two
ecclesiastics
you
talk
of
these
shameful
things
as
if
you
were
talking
of
the
gospel
in
fact
i
do
not
know
which
to
be
the
more
astonished
at
the
freedom
of
your
talk
or
the
sad
opinion
which
you
have
of
me
but
i
see
whence
all
this
emanates
do
you
take
me
then
for
a
bad
priest
what
is
that
do
you
take
me
for
a
simpleton
for
one
of
uncles
enough
of
playing
a
farce
you
do
not
take
me
in
my
good
fellow
i
told
you
yesterday
that
you
were
cleverer
than
i
you
did
not
see
then
that
i
was
joking
your
mask
is
still
too
transparent
one
sees
the
tears
behind
the
grinning
face
no
tragic
aim
come
down
from
this
stage
on
which
you
strut
in
such
a
ridiculous
manner
and
let
us
talk
seriously
like
plain
citizens
or
bad
priests
be
silent
the
bad
priests
that
is
to
say
the
clumsy
priests
which
is
all
the
same
are
in
your
cassock
and
the
clumsy
ones
are
those
who
allow
themselves
to
be
caught
you
have
been
caught
my
son
and
caught
by
whom
by
your
cook
ha
ha
are
you
not
ashamed
to
listen
to
the
and
calumny
of
that
horrible
woman
horrible
be
quiet
you
are
blind
it
is
your
conduct
which
is
horrible
to
concoct
such
intrigues
i
concoct
no
intrigue
and
when
that
does
occur
when
my
feelings
of
respect
of
esteem
of
friendship
for
a
young
person
endowed
with
virtues
and
graces
change
into
a
sweeter
feeling
at
all
events
if
my
position
compels
me
to
conceal
my
inclinations
from
the
world
i
shall
have
no
need
to
blush
for
them
when
face
to
face
with
myself
that
is
to
say
with
my
dignity
as
a
man
while
your
allusions
your
instigation
to
certain
intimacies
which
in
order
to
be
more
closely
hidden
are
only
the
more
abominable
and
degrading
inspire
me
only
with
disgust
oh
holy
spirit
enlighten
him
he
is
wandering
he
is
a
triple
fool
when
i
suspected
when
i
discovered
when
i
saw
that
you
were
entering
on
a
perilous
path
i
gave
you
yesterday
the
advice
which
a
priest
of
my
age
has
the
right
to
give
to
one
of
yours
especially
when
he
is
as
i
am
regardful
of
his
future
i
am
as
regardful
of
it
as
you
cease
your
idle
words
have
you
decided
to
go
no
uncle
i
am
well
off
here
and
i
stay
here
well
off
mouldy
in
your
vices
and
obscurity
wallowing
like
job
on
your
roll
yourself
in
your
filth
for
my
part
i
know
what
course
remains
for
me
to
take
you
will
do
what
you
think
proper
i
am
sure
of
it
but
you
instead
of
having
the
excellent
cure
which
was
destined
for
you
you
shall
have
one
lower
still
than
this
where
you
can
wallow
at
your
ease
in
your
idleness
your
nothingness
and
your
vices
for
i
swear
to
you
by
my
blessed
patron
that
if
i
go
away
without
you
you
shall
not
remain
here
for
hours
i
will
have
you
recalled
by
the
bishop
you
laugh
you
know
me
all
the
same
you
know
when
i
say
it
is
a
word
is
enough
for
monseigneur
you
know
marcel
knew
the
character
of
the
old
curé
well
enough
to
know
that
he
was
capable
of
keeping
his
word
fearing
to
irritate
him
more
by
his
obstinacy
he
thought
it
better
to
appear
to
yield
it
is
time
for
mass
he
said
we
will
talk
about
that
again
go
my
son
and
pray
to
the
holy
spirit
lxxv
during
mass
i
have
my
rights
of
love
and
portion
of
the
sun
let
us
together
flee
a
de
vigny
it
will
easily
be
credited
that
marcel
thoughts
had
little
in
common
with
the
holy
eucharist
he
would
have
been
a
very
ungrateful
lover
if
his
whole
soul
had
not
flown
towards
suzanne
this
was
then
his
chief
preoccupation
while
he
murmured
the
long
partook
of
christ
and
recited
his
prayers
what
should
he
decide
that
was
his
second
should
he
go
away
that
meant
fortune
reconciliation
with
the
bishop
putting
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
of
honours
young
intelligent
learned
what
was
there
to
stop
him
but
that
meant
separation
from
suzanne
saying
farewell
to
all
those
divine
delights
which
he
had
just
tasted
he
had
hardly
time
to
moisten
his
parched
lips
in
the
cup
before
the
cup
was
shattered
he
was
truly
in
love
for
he
should
have
said
to
himself
there
are
other
cups
but
for
him
there
was
but
one
uncle
ridoux
the
bishop
and
greatness
might
go
to
the
devil
the
promised
cure
and
the
episcopal
mitre
might
go
to
the
devil
too
did
he
not
possess
the
most
precious
of
treasures
the
most
enviable
blessing
the
supplement
and
complement
of
everything
the
ambition
of
every
young
man
the
desire
of
every
old
man
of
every
man
who
has
a
heart
a
young
lovely
modest
loving
intelligent
and
adored
mistress
but
what
might
not
be
the
result
of
that
love
what
drama
what
tragedy
and
perhaps
what
ludicrous
comedy
in
which
he
the
priest
would
play
the
odious
and
ridiculous
character
this
love
which
plunged
him
into
an
ocean
of
delights
would
it
not
plunge
him
also
into
an
abyss
of
misfortunes
could
it
proceed
for
long
without
being
known
and
remarked
scandal
shame
and
death
perhaps
a
terrible
trinity
were
they
waiting
not
at
his
door
for
the
viper
which
harboured
at
his
hearth
had
its
piercing
glassy
eye
fixed
unweariedly
on
him
and
how
could
he
crush
the
viper
what
could
he
do
what
could
he
venture
he
remembered
hearing
of
priests
who
had
fled
away
with
young
girls
whom
they
had
seduced
and
he
thought
for
an
instant
that
he
would
carry
off
suzanne
and
fly
willingly
would
he
have
left
behind
him
his
honour
and
his
reputation
willingly
would
he
have
torn
his
priestly
robe
on
the
sharp
points
of
infamy
and
scandal
willingly
would
he
have
quitted
for
ever
that
cursed
parsonage
where
shame
and
humiliation
vice
and
remorse
were
henceforth
installed
but
suzanne
would
she
follow
him
then
had
he
well
weighed
the
mortifications
which
await
the
apostate
priest
to
be
nameless
in
society
with
no
future
repulsed
despised
scoffed
at
by
all
should
he
like
the
père
hyacinth
go
and
found
a
free
church
in
some
corner
of
the
republic
and
rove
through
europe
like
him
to
confer
about
morality
the
rights
of
women
and
virtue
would
not
poverty
come
and
knock
at
his
door
poverty
with
a
beloved
wife
it
would
appear
a
hideous
and
terrifying
spectre
chilling
in
its
livid
approach
and
in
its
kisses
of
love
to
struggle
against
these
obstacles
he
would
need
high
energy
and
high
courage
and
he
felt
that
courage
and
energy
were
lacking
in
him
the
miserable
coward
who
had
shamefully
succumbed
to
the
clumsy
artifices
of
a
lascivious
woman
who
had
allowed
the
first
fruits
of
his
virginity
and
his
youth
to
be
lost
in
shameful
debauch
while
close
by
there
was
an
adorable
maiden
whose
heart
was
beating
in
unison
with
his
own
thus
did
his
reflection
lead
him
till
the
end
of
the
gospel
and
when
he
said
the
he
had
as
yet
decided

never

with

on
those
deep
and
troublesome
matters
which
are

in

every

when
marcel
had
gone
away
suzanne
when
she
had
quietly
shut
the
by
which
she
had
gone
out
went
upstairs
to
her
room
and
sat
down
on
the
side
of
her
bed
she
asked
herself
if
she
had
not
just
been
the
sport
of
an
hallucination
if
it
was
really
true
that
a
man
had
gone
out
of
the
house
who
had
held
her
in
his
arms
to
whom
she
had
yielded
herself
everything
had
happened
so
rapidly
that
she
had
had
no
time
to
think
to
reflect
to
say
to
herself
what
does

want
with
me
no
time
even
to
recover
herself
a

a
violent
emotion
a
transient
indignation
a
struggle
for
a
few
seconds
a
sharp
pain
and
that
was
all
the
crime
was
consummated
she
had
lost
her
honour
and
that
was
love
she
wished
not
to
believe
it
but
her
disordered
corsage
her
dishevelled
hair
upon
her
bare
shoulders
her
crumpled
and
more
than
all
that
the
violent
leaping
of
her
heart
told
her
that
she
was
not
dreaming
he
was
gone
the
priest
he
had
fled
away
into
the
night
happy
and
light
of
heart
leaving
her
alone
with
her
shame
and
the
ulcer
of
remorse
in
her
soul
and
then
big
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
and
fell
upon
her
breasts
still
burning
with
his
feverish
caresses
it
is
all
over
it
is
all
over
where
is
my
virginity
weep
poor
girl
weep
for
that
virginity
is
already
far
away
and
nothing
it
is
said
flees
faster
than
the
illusion
which
departs
if
it
be
not
a
virginity
which
flies
away
and
a
vague
terror
was
mingled
with
her
remorse
the
first
apprehension
which
strikes
brutally
against
the
edifice
of
illusions
of
the
woman
who
has
committed
a
fault
is
the
anxiety
regarding
the
opinion
of
the
man
who
has
incited
her
to
that
fault
i
am
speaking
be
it
understood
of
one
in
whom
there
remains
the
feeling
of
modesty
without
which
she
is
not
a
woman
but
an
unclean
female
when
she
awakes
from
her
short
delirium
she
says
to
herself
what
will
he
think
of
me
what
will
he
believe
will
he
not
despise
me
and
she
has
good
grounds
for
apprehension
for
often
i
believe
i
have
said
so
already
the
contempt
of
her
accomplice
is
all
that
remains
to
her
and
then
what
man
is
there
who
after
having
at
length
possessed
the
wife
or
the
maiden
so
long
pursued
and
desired
does
not
say
to
himself
in
the
morning
when
his
fever
is
dissipated
when
the
bandage
which
hitherto
has
covered
the
eyes
of
love
is
unbound
from
the
eyes
of
love
when
the
which
has
so
many
charms
has
become
the
that
we
despise
when
of
the
rosy
inflated
illusion
there
remains
but
a
yellow
skeleton
she
has
given
herself
to
me
trustingly
and
artlessly
but
might
she
not
have
given
herself
with
equal
facility
to
another
if
i
had
not
been
there
for
in
fact
what
devil
a
strange
question
but
one
which
unavoidably
takes
up
its
abode
in
the
heart
and
waits
to
come
forth
and
be
present
one
day
on
the
lips
at
the
time
when
satiety
gives
the
last
kick
to
the
last
house
of
cards
erected
by
pleasure
and
it
is
thus
that
after
doing
everything
to
draw
a
woman
into
our
own
fall
we
are
discontented
with
her
for
her
sacrifice
and
for
her
love
for
there
comes
a
moment
when
the
for
whom
one
would
have
given
one
life
the
for
whom
one
would
have
sacrificed
country
family
fortune
future
is
no
more
than
a
common
mistress
ranked
in
the
ordinary
lot
with
the
rest
and
for
whom
one
would
hesitate
to
spend
have
you
not
chanced
sometimes
to
follow
with
an
envious
eye
on
some
fresh
morning
in
spring
or
on
a
lovely
autumn
evening
the
solitary
walk
of
a
loving
couple
they
go
slowly
hand
in
hand
avoiding
notice
selecting
the
shady
and
secret
paths
or
the
darkest
walks
in
the
woods
he
is
handsome
young
and
strong
she
is
pretty
and
charming
pale
with
emotion
or
blushing
with
modesty
what
things
they
murmur
as
they
lean
one
towards
another
what
sweet
projects
of
an
endless
future
what
oaths
which
ought
to
be
eternal
sworn
untiringly
lip
on
lip
one
of
those
noble
loves
which
have
no
end
happy
egotists
they
think
but
of
themselves
all
except
themselves
is
insupportable
to
them
all
but
themselves
wearies
and
weighs
upon
them
the
universe
is
themselves
life
is
the
present
which
glides
along
and
in
order
to
delay
the
present
and
enjoy
it
at
their
ease
they
have
no
scruple
in
mortgaging
the
future
and
they
go
on
listening
to
the
divine
harmony
the
mysterious
poem
which
sings
in
their
own
heart
of
youth
and
love
you
have
envied
them
who
would
not
envy
them
it
is
happiness
which
passes
by
make
way
respectfully
what
you
smiled
sorrowfully
ah
it
is
because
like
me
you
have
seen
behind
these
poor
trustful
children
following
them
as
the
used
to
follow
the
triumphal
chariot
of
old
a
demon
with
sinister
countenance
who
with
his
brutal
hands
will
soon
roughly
tear
the
veil
woven
of
fancies
the
reality
who
is
there
with
his
rags
getting
ready
to
cast
them
upon
their
bright
tinsels
of
gauze
and
spangles
wait
a
few
years
a
few
months
perhaps
only
a
few
weeks
what
has
become
of
those
handsome
lovers
so
tenderly
entwined
they
swore
mouth
to
mouth
an
endless
love
where
are
they
where
are
their
loves
as
well
would
it
be
worth
to
ask
where
are
the
leaves
of
autumn
which
the
evening
breeze
carried
away
last
year
but
where
are
the
snows
of
what
already
it
is
finished
and
yet
he
had
sworn
to
love
her
always
yes
but
she
also
had
sworn
to
be
always
amiable
which
of
the
two
first
forfeited
the
oath
there
has
been
then
a
tragedy
a
drama
despair
tears
nonsense
those
who
had
sworn
to
die
one
for
the
other
one
fine
day
parted
as
strangers
the
charming
young
girl
whom
you
saw
passing
by
proud
and
radiant
on
the
arm
of
that
artless
stripling
see
here
she
comes
a
little
weary
a
little
faded
but
still
charming
on
the
arm
of
that
cynical
bohemian
that
poetical
who
smiled
and
scattered
daisies
on
the
head
of
her
lover
as
he
knelt
before
her
has
become
the
adored
wife
of
a
dull
and
the
other
one
who
took
the
ivy
for
her
emblem
and
who
said
to
her
sweetheart
i
cling
till
death
has
clung
to
and
separated
from
others
without
dying
and
has
finished
by
fastening
herself
to
a
rheumatical
old
churchwarden
peevish
but
substantial
and
the
lover
he
is
no
better
he
has
loved
twenty
since
the
deep
sea
of
oblivion
has
passed
between
them
and
among
so
many
vanished
mistresses
can
he
precisely
remember
her
name
suzanne
did
not
say
all
this
to
herself
she
was
ignorant
of
the
whirlpools
of
life
but
she
felt
instinctively
that
she
was
about
to
be
precipated
into
an
abyss
she
was
not
perverse
she
was
merely
frivolous
and
coquettish
but
she
had
received
a
vicious
education
her
imagination
only
had
been
corrupted
her
heart
had
remained
till
then
untainted
it
was
a
good
ear
of
corn
which
somehow
or
another
had
made
its
way
into
the
field
of
tares
she
reproached
herself
bitterly
therefore
for
the
shameful
facility
with
which
she
had
yielded
herself
to
the
priest
and
she
sought
for
an
excuse
to
try
and
palliate
her
fault
in
her
own
eyes
but
she
was
unable
to
discover
any
genuine
excuses
a
young
girl
is
pardoned
for
yielding
herself
to
her
lover
in
a
moment
of
forgetfulness
and
excitement
because
she
hopes
that
marriage
will
atone
for
her
fault
but
what
had
she
to
claim
what
could
she
expect
from
this
curé
again
a
young
wife
is
pardoned
for
deceiving
an
old
husband
or
a
husband
who
is
worthless
debauched
and
brutal
and
for
seeking
a
friend
abroad
whom
she
can
not
find
at
her
but
she
whom
had
she
deceived
her
father
who
though
severe
adored
her
whom
had
she
dishonoured
the
white
hairs
of
that
worthy
brave
old
man
she
saw
clearly
that
she
could
find
no
excuse
and
she
was
compelled
to
confess
that
she
ought
to
feel
ashamed
of
herself
but
what
affected
her
most
was
the
thought
that
her
lover
the
priest
must
have
been
extremely
surprised
at
his
victory
himself
and
that
if
he
too
were
to
attempt
to
find
an
excuse
for
her
conduct
he
could
discover
none
either
but
in
proportion
as
she
felt
astonished
at
her
shame
as
she
saw
into
what
a
corner
she
had
been
driven
as
she
dreaded
the
man
scorn
for
whom
she
had
fallen
so
low
did
she
feel
her
love
grow
greater
lxxvii
consolations
every
fault
finds
its
excuse
in
itself
this
is
the
sophistry
in
which
we
are
richest
the
struggle
of
good
and
evil
is
serious
and
really
painful
only
in
the
case
of
a
man
who
has
been
brought
up
in
a
position
where
actions
deeds
and
thoughts
have
had
the
power
of
emile
leclercq
fille
du
before
her
fault
or
if
you
prefer
it
her
fall
this
was
but
the
odd
caprice
of
an
ardent
amorous
passionate
young
girl
whose
feelings
are
exhilarated
and
excited
by
a
licentious
imagination
continually
nourished
by
the
senseless
reading
of
the
adventures
of
heroes
who
have
existed
nowhere
but
in
the
brain
of
novelists
therefore
eager
for
the
unknown
she
hastens
to
lay
hold
of
the
first
rascal
who
comes
forward
having
a
little
talkativeness
and
good
looks
and
who
will
be
for
one
day
the
ideal
she
has
dreamed
of
if
he
knows
how
to
brazen
it
out
every
woman
is
at
heart
a
rake
said
the
great
poet
alexander
pope
and
as
for
those
who
in
spite
of
the
heat
of
an
ungovernable
temperament
remain
virtuous
and
chaste
we
must
scarcely
be
pleased
at
them
on
that
account
it
is
simply
because
they
have
not
had
the
opportunity
to
sin
the
opportunity
which
makes
the
thief
is
also
the
touchstone
of
virtue
therefore
when
this
blessed
opportunity
presents
itself
although
it
is
said
to
be
bald
they
well
know
how
to
find
other
hairs
on
it
by
which
they
seize
and
do
not
let
it
go
again
certainly
there
are
exceptions
and
i
am
far
from
saying
una
disce
you
madame
for
instance
who
read
me
i
am
convinced
that
you
are
not
in
that
category
of
women
of
whom
the
englishman
pope
made
this
wicked
remark
suzanne
felt
now
possessed
by
a
wild
infatuation
for
the
man
to
whom
she
had
yielded
herself
almost
without
love
and
do
not
young
girls
frequently
yield
themselves
in
this
manner
she
felt
herself
attracted
towards
him
by
the
purely
physical
and
magnetic
phenomenon
which
impels
the
female
towards
the
male
for
we
shall
try
in
vain
and
talk
in
vain
raise
ourselves
on
our
dwarfish
heels
talk
of
the
ethereal
essence
of
our
soul
and
the
quintessence
of
our
feelings
idealize
woman
and
deify
love
there
always
comes
a
moment
when
we
become
like
the
brute
and
when
the
passion
of
seraphims
can
not
be
distinguished
in
anything
from
that
of
man
goes
by
night
in
some
street
obscure
to
a
lodging
low
and
dark
suzanne
certainly
had
not
taken
note
of
her
impressions
attracted
towards
marcel
by
his
sympathetic
beauty
by
his
sweet
and
unctuous
voice
and
especially
by
the
vague
sorrow
displayed
on
his
countenance
perhaps
still
more
by
the
opposition
and
slanders
of
her
father
she
had
allowed
herself
to
be
won
before
she
know
where
she
was
going
she
was
far
from
any
carnal
thought
and
she
would
have
been
considerably
surprised
if
anyone
had
told
her
that
the
priest
loved
her
otherwise
than
as
a
sister
is
loved
but
that
is
not
what
we
men
understand
by
love
the
werthers
who
regard
their
mistress
as
a
sacred
divinity
whom
we
ought
to
touch
with
trembling
are
rare
they
are
not
met
again
after
eighteen
marcel
was
more
than
eighteen
therefore
he
had
found
his
desires
become
more
inflamed
than
ever
in
the
presence
of
his
mistress
if
he
had
been
hesitating
and
timid
like
charlotte
lover
i
do
not
doubt
that
she
would
have
found
time
to
gather
within
herself
the
force
necessary
to
resist
him
but
she
felt
herself
mastered
before
even
she
had
recovered
from
her
terror
and
confusion
i
do
not
wish
to
try
and
excuse
her
but
she
repented
and
how
far
more
worthy
of
respect
is
the
repentance
of
certain
fallen
women
than
the
haughty
virtue
of
certain
others
and
perceiving
that
she
found
no
excuse
for
her
fault
suzanne
tried
to
deceive
herself
by
exalting
above
measure
the
worth
of
the
man
who
had
ruined
her
he
is
no
ordinary
man
after
all
she
said
to
herself
and
we
do
not
love
the
man
we
wish
it
does
honour
to
the
heart
to
repose
its
love
rightly
it
is
natural
then
that
i
should
say
that
i
should
confess
to
myself
since
i
can
not
confess
it
to
others
yes
i
love
him
who
would
not
love
him
yes
i
have
given
myself
to
him
but
who
in
my
place
would
have
had
the
power
to
resist
him
is
it
not
a
fact
that
everybody
here
loves
him
have
i
not
observed
the
looks
of
all
these
village
girls
fixed
on
him
with
eager
desire
it
would
have
been
easy
for
him
to
make
his
choice
among
the
prettiest
but
he
has
seen
me
only
he
is
a
priest
but
what
does
that
matter
is
he
not
a
man
and
this
man
as
handsome
as
a
god
i
feel
that
i
love
him
much
more
than
a
lover
ought
to
be
loved
for
i
love
not
only
for
the
happiness
of
loving
him
and
being
loved
by
him
but
also
from
pride
because
i
am
proud
of
him
because
i
admire
his
fine
and
noble
nature
so
open
so
sweet
so
charming
so
audacious
which
led
astray
into
this
false
and
thankless
position
must
find
itself
so
unhappy
then
i
was
so
affected
the
first
time
that
my
look
met
his
i
felt
that
all
my
being
was
his
but
especially
my
inward
feelings
my
spirit
my
soul
and
my
sentiments
and
in
this
way
there
is
a
great
difference
in
man
and
in
woman
in
their
love
in
man
possession
most
frequently
causes
passion
to
disappear
the
reality
kills
the
ideal
the
awakening
the
dream
in
woman
on
the
other
hand
it
nearly
always
enhances
for
the
first
time
at
any
rate
the
fascination
of
being
loved
for
she
attaches
herself
to
him
in
proportion
to
the
trouble
the
shame
the
sacrifice
for
with
man
love
is
but
an
episode
while
with
woman
it
is
her
whole
life
lxxviii
false
alarm
she
there
thou
what
can
that
be
the
maid
whose
pure
fresh
face
attracted
me
but
now
when
i
beheld
her
in
her
home
alas
and
can
the
flower
so
quickly
fade
delphine
gay
suzanne
who
had
passed
a
sleepless
night
was
fast
asleep
in
the
morning
when
her
father
burst
into
her
room
like
a
hurricane
she
woke
with
a
start
all
pale
and
trembling
she
tried
nevertheless
to
assume
the
most
innocent
and
the
calmest
air
what
is
the
matter
papa
but
durand
did
not
answer
he
surveyed
the
room
with
a
scrutinizing
eye
apparently
interrogating
the
furniture
and
the
walls
as
if
he
were
asking
them
if
they
had
not
been
witnesses
of
some
unusual
event
but
if
walls
at
times
have
eyes
and
ears
they
have
no
tongue
they
can
not
relate
the
things
they
have
seen
then
he
turned
towards
his
daughter
in
such
a
singular
way
that
suzanne
dropped
her
eyes
and
felt
she
was
going
to
faint
suzanne
he
demanded
of
her
abruptly
did
you
hear
anything
in
the
night
i
she
said
with
the
most
profound
astonishment
yes
you
suzanne
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
speaking
to
you
did
you
hear
anything
in
the
night
she
thought
she
saw
at
first
that
her
father
knew
nothing
and
in
spite
of
herself
a
long
sigh
of
relief
escaped
her
breast
therefore
she
replied
with
the
most
natural
air
in
the
world
what
do
you
mean
that
i
have
heard
father
something
has
happened
my
daughter
this
very
night
in
the
garden
said
durand
scanning
his
words
something
extraordinary
this
time
suzanne
was
terrified
nevertheless
she
collected
all
her
courage
fully
determined
to
lie
to
the
last
extremity
well
well
father
you
puzzle
me
and
leaning
her
pretty
pale
head
on
her
plump
arm
she
looked
at
her
father
with
perfect
assurance
she
was
charming
thus
her
black
hair
long
and
curling
partly
covered
her
round
polished
shoulders
and
her
velvety
eye
was
frankly
fixed
on
durand
the
old
soldier
was
moved
he
looked
at
his
daughter
with
admiration
and
reproached
himself
doubtlessly
for
his
wrongful
suspicions
for
he
said
gently
do
not
lie
to
me
suzanne
and
answer
my
questions
frankly
i
know
very
well
that
you
are
not
guilty
that
you
can
not
be
guilty
that
you
have
nothing
to
reproach
yourself
with
you
quite
see
then
that
i
am
not
angry
but
sometimes
young
girls
allow
themselves
to
be
led
into
acts
of
thoughtlessness
which
they
believe
to
be
of
no
consequence
and
which
yet
have
a
gravity
which
they
do
not
foresee
last
night
a
man
entered
the
garden
the
garden
said
suzanne
alarmed
afresh
and
ever
feeling
the
fixed
and
scrutinizing
look
dwelling
upon
her
no
doubt
it
is
a
thief
no
father
no
i
have
heard
nothing
i
have
several
reasons
for
believing
that
it
is
not
a
thief
thieves
take
more
precautions
this
one
walked
heavily
in
my
ah
what
a
pity
in
the
he
has
crushed
some
no
doubt
yes
in
the
the
mark
of
his
feet
is
distinctly
visible
suzanne
could
contain
herself
no
longer
her
deserted
her
and
she
felt
that
her
strength
was
going
also
she
believed
that
her
father
knew
all
she
saw
herself
lost
and
to
conceal
her
shame
and
hide
her
terror
she
buried
herself
under
the
sobbing
and
saying
ah
papa
ah
papa
the
old
soldier
mistook
her
terror
her
despair
and
her
tears
come
he
cried
confound
it
suzanne
are
you
mad
do
cry
like
this
little
girl
do
cry
like
this
like
a
fool
i
only
wanted
to
know
if
you
had
heard
anything
no
father
sobbed
suzanne
under
her
you
did
not
hear
him
well
very
good
that
is
all
confound
it
another
time
we
will
keep
our
eyes
open
that
is
all
but
the
shock
had
been
too
great
and
suzanne
continued
to
utter
sobs
she
decided
however
to
show
her
face
all
bathed
in
tears
and
said
to
her
father
in
a
reproachful
tone
and
besides
i
did
not
know
what
you
meant
with
your
and
your
i
was
fast
asleep
and
you
woke
me
up
with
a
start
to
tell
me
that
true
i
have
been
rather
abrupt
i
was
wrong
well
do
let
us
talk
about
it
any
more
hang
it
but
suzanne
having
recovered
herself
wanted
to
enjoy
her
triumph
to
the
end
i
do
know
what
you
could
have
meant
she
added
still
in
tears
by
coming
and
telling
me
in
an
angry
tone
that
a
man
had
been
walking
in
your
asparagus
as
if
it
were
my
fault
it
is
true
nevertheless
suzanne
it
is
quite
plain
i
arrived
this
morning
quite
dusty
from
my
journey
and
went
down
into
the
garden
very
quietly
as
i
usually
do
thinking
of
nothing
when
all
at
once
i
stopped
what
did
i
behold
footsteps
child
a
man
footsteps
right
in
the
middle
of
my
borders
hang
it
i
cried
here
is
a
blackguard
who
makes
himself
at
home
i
followed
their
track
which
led
me
to
the
wall
of
the
house
and
right
up
to
the
that
was
rather
bad
you
know
there
was
still
some
fresh
soil
on
the
steps
good
heavens
i
asked
myself
then
what
it
meant
and
i
came
to
you
to
learn
to
me
father
but
i
know
no
more
about
it
than
you
do
why
do
you
suppose
that
i
know
more
about
it
than
you
durand
had
great
confidence
in
his
daughter
he
knew
her
to
be
giddy
and
frivolous
but
he
did
not
suppose
for
an
instant
her
giddiness
and
frivolity
amounted
to
the
forgetfulness
of
duty
many
fathers
in
this
manner
allow
themselves
to
be
deceived
by
their
children
with
the
same
blindness
and
meekness
as
foolish
husbands
are
deceived
by
their
wives
till
the
day
when
the
bandage
which
covered
their
eyes
falls
at
length
and
they
discover
to
their
amazement
that
the
which
they
had
brought
up
with
so
much
care
and
love
and
whose
long
roll
of
good
qualities
talents
and
virtues
they
loved
to
recount
before
strangers
is
nothing
but
a
little
being
saturated
with
vice
and
in
overweening
vanity
he
embraced
her
with
a
father
tender
and
affectionate
look
and
for
some
time
gazed
upon
suzanne
clear
eyes
no
he
said
to
himself
there
can
be
no
vice
in
this
young
soul
is
not
this
calm
brow
and
these
pure
eyes
the
evidence
of
the
purity
of
her
soul
and
taking
one
of
her
hands
in
his
he
remained
near
her
bed
and
said
to
her
gently
it
is
a
fact
i
say
again
my
child
that
i
know
young
people
sometimes
without
thinking
or
intending
any
evil
commit
imprudent
acts
which
are
nothing
at
first
but
which
often
have
dangerous
consequences
sometimes
carelessly
they
fasten
their
eyes
on
a
young
man
whom
they
meet
at
church
at
a
ball
during
a
walk
or
no
matter
where
well
that
is
enough
for
him
to
construe
the
look
as
an
advance
which
is
made
to
him
or
at
least
as
an
encouragement
and
to
believe
himself
authorized
then
to
undertake
some
enterprise
good
heavens
all
seductions
begin
in
the
same
way
we
men
are
for
the
most
part
very
infatuated
with
ourselves
i
my
dearest
child
can
make
that
confession
without
any
shame
for
i
have
long
since
passed
the
age
of
although
we
still
come
across
some
old
rascals
who
want
to
gobble
up
chickens
and
forget
that
they
have
lost
their
teeth
men
are
very
foolish
young
men
particularly
and
willingly
imagine
that
all
the
ladies
are
dying
of
love
for
their
little
persons
a
young
woman
passes
by
and
happens
to
look
at
them
as
one
looks
at
a
dog
or
a
pig
good
they
say
directly
stop
stop
that
woman
wants
me
and
immediately
they
try
the
knot
of
their
tie
arrange
their
collar
and
assuming
a
triumphant
air
begin
to
follow
her
and
consider
themselves
authorized
to
address
her
impertinently
ah
ah
said
suzanne
i
can
see
that
now
father
there
were
some
young
fellows
who
used
to
follow
us
always
at
school
with
their
moustaches
well
waxed
and
a
fine
parting
in
their
hair
behind
heavens
how
they
have
amused
us
at
other
times
said
durand
a
young
girl
is
at
her
window
a
gentleman
passing
by
all
at
once
lifts
his
nose
the
young
girl
sees
him
their
eyes
meet
eh
eh
says
the
gentleman
there
is
a
little
thing
who
is
rather
nice
my
word
she
is
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
and
i
believe
that
it
would
not
be
difficult
the
devil
it
would
be
charming
what
a
look
she
gave
me
let
us
have
a
try
and
the
rogue
commences
to
walk
up
and
down
under
the
windows
doing
all
he
can
to
compromise
the
girl
and
all
these
young
fellows
my
dear
are
like
that
they
have
the
most
deplorable
opinion
of
women
that
one
would
say
that
their
mothers
had
all
been
very
ladies
and
now
that
is
enough
together
they
passed
in
minute
review
all
the
young
village
but
durand
suspicion
did
not
rest
on
any

during
this
time
the
for
nancy
was
carrying
away
marcel
and
ridoux
at
full
trot
marcel
had
appeared
to
yield
to
his
exhortations
and
said
to
himself
let
us
go
that
does
not
bind
me
to
anything
in
a
couple
of
days
at
the
latest
i
shall
be
on
my
way
back
and
this
had
made
the
worthy
ridoux
quite
happy
they
were
alone
in
the
and
could
converse
at
their
ease
look
at
this
lovely
country
that
valley
those
little
hills
and
away
there
the
large
woods
and
do
you
not
think
that
i
shall
feel
some
regret
at
leaving
this
part
and
that
little
white
house
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
is
it
there
ah
so
veronica
has
pointed
it
out
to
you
reluctantly
my
son
but
i
wanted
to
know
all
she
is
a
cautious
and
trustworthy
person
who
is
entirely
devoted
to
you
not
a
word
more
about
that
cautious
woman
uncle
i
pray
let
us
rather
talk
about
your
promotion
my
promotion
i
assure
you
uncle
that
i
am
no
longer
ambitious
what
are
you
saying
there
you
are
no
longer
ambitious
you
are
going
perhaps
to
make
me
believe
that
you
are
happy
in
your
shell
come
rouse
yourself
has
a
moral
torpor
already
seized
you
you
are
no
longer
ambitious
well
i
will
be
so
for
you
and
i
intend
yes
i
intend
do
you
hear
that
you
should
make
your
way
what
happiness
for
a
poor
old
man
like
me
when
i
hear
them
say
monsieur
ridoux
i
have
just
seen
your
nephew
monseigneur
marcel
go
by
i
shall
answer
then
it
is
i
however
who
have
made
him
who
have
formed
him

me
your
patronage

you
not
dear
uncle
said
marcel
softened
pressing
the
old
curé
hands

have
those
ideas
then
you
always
think
then
that
i
shall
become
a
bishop

i
think
so
i
do
more
than
that
i
am
sure
of
it
are
you
not
of
the
stuff
of
which
they
make
them
why

one
as
well
as
another
a
bishopric

not
for
the
do
worry
me
are
you

dear
fellow

really
must
get
this
into
your
head
that
in
order
to
succeed
in
our
profession
evangelical
virtues
are
more
detrimental
than
useful
and
that
there
are
two
things
indispensable
first
to
have
a
good
outside
show
to
stir
yourself
and
to
know
how
to
intrigue
to
the
utmost
as
for
talent
that
is
an
accessory
which
can
do
no
harm
but
after
all
it
is
merely
an
accessory
now
you
have
a
good
outside
show
you
have
more
talent
than
is
necessary
there
is
only
one
thing
in
which
you
are
faulty
you
are
not
sufficiently
intriguing
well
i
will
be
so
for
you
and
i
will
stir
myself
up
for
you
success
wholly
lies
in
that
you
say
that
a
bishopric
is
not
for
the
you
make
me
laugh
look
at
ours
monseigneur
collard
what
transcendant
genius
does
he
possess
is
not
his
morality
somewhat
elastic
and
his
virtues
very
doubtful
but
he
has
a
magnificent
head
and
that
from
all
time
has
pleased
the
world
in
general
and
the
women
in
particular
ah
the
women
my
dear
friend
the
women
you
do
not
know
what
a
weight
they
are
in
the
scales
of
our
destinies
and
in
the
choice
of
our
superiors
i
know
something
about
it
and
if
i
had
had
a
smaller
nose
and
a
mouth
i
should
not
be
now
curé
of
nicholas
but
i
am
ugly
and
they
despise
me
how
many
i
know
who
owe
their
cross
and
their
mitre
to
the
way
in
which
they
say
in
the
pulpit
my
sisters
and
to
the
amiable
manner
in
which
they
receive
the
confessions
of
influential
sheep
you
confess
uncle
that
it
is
abominable
i
confess
that
it
is
in
human
nature
that
is
all
i
confess
is
it
not
logical
to
befriend
people
whose
appearance
pleases
you
rather
than
those
whose
face
is
disagreeable
to
you
good
heavens
it
has
always
been
the
case
since
the
commencement
of
the
world
all
that
you
could
say
on
the
subject
would
not
make
the
slightest
change
let
us
therefore
profit
by
our
advantages
when
we
have
advantages
and
leave
fruitless
jeremiads
to
the
foolish
and
envious
birth
also
counts
for
much
in
our
fortune
often
but
not
always
look
at
collard
again
who
is
the
son
of
a
journeyman
baker
he
has
that
in
common
with
pope
benedict
xii
yes
but
he
has
that
only
therefore
since
it
is
neither
his
birth
nor
his
genius
nor
his
virtues
which
have
helped
him
on
it
is
then
something
else
in
fact
ecclesiastical
history
abounds
in
similar
instances
men
starting
from
the
most
humble
condition
have
attained
the
supreme
dignity
benedict
xi
had
tended
sheep
the
great
sixtus
v
was
a
swineherd
urban
vi
was
the
son
of
a
cobbler
alexander
v
had
been
a
beggar
and
a
host
of
others
of
the
same
feather
well
that
ought
to
encourage
you
who
are
the
son
neither
of
a
cobbler
or
of
a
would
to
heaven
that
i
were
a
cobbler
or
a
shepherd
myself
i
could
have
married
according
to
my
taste
and
have
become
the
worthy
father
of
a
family
an
honest
artisan
rather
than
a
bad
curé
yes
but
mademoiselle
durand
would
not
have
wanted
you
oh
uncle
do
not
speak
of
that
young
person
with
whom
you
are
not
acquainted
and
regarding
whom
you
are
strangely
mistaken
for
you
see
her
through
the
dirty
spectacles
of
my
servant
you
want
to
take
me
away
on
her
account
but
are
there
not
young
persons
everywhere
you
know
as
well
as
i
to
what
dangers
young
priests
are
exposed
shall
i
be
safe
from
those
dangers
by
going
away
no
and
since
it
is
agreed
between
us
that
no
more
than
others
can
we
avoid
certain
necessities
of
nature
alas
human
infirmity
omnia
vincit
amor
et
nos
cadamus
amori
then
then
we
choose
our
company
for
instance
that
pretty
girl
there
and
ridoux
leant
his
head
out
of
the
door
they
had
just
reached
vic
where
they
changed
horses
lxxx
an
old
acquaintance
methinks
queen
mab
upon
your
cheek
doth
blend
the
tints
of
cream
and
rose
and
lends
the
pearls
which
deck
her
hat
and
rubies
too
from
off
her
gown
to
be
your
own
fit
ornament
dario
before
the
des
a
young
girl
modestly
dressed
was
waiting
for
the
with
an
old
in
her
hand
marcel
who
had
also
put
his
head
out
of
the
looked
at
her
with
surprise
he
had
seen
this
girl
somewhere
yes
he
remembered
her
he
had
seen
that
charming
countenance
he
had
already
admired
that
fair
hair
and
those
blue
eyes
but
the
face
had
grown
pale
the
cheeks
had
lost
their
freshness
with
the
and
the
bosom
its
opulence
marcel
thought
her
prettier
and
more
delicate
like
this
for
it
was
really
she
the
mountebank
daughter
whom
he
had
seen
a
few
weeks
before
dancing
in
the
of
althausen
by
what
chance
was
she
still
in
the
neighbourhood
this
travelling
swallow
was
the
house
on
wheels
then
in
the
vicinity
with
its
two
horses
and
the
clown
with
the
cracked
voice
and
the
big
woman
with
the
red
face
and
the
thin
and
hungry
little
children
he
looked
if
he
could
not
see
them
all
but
he
saw
only
the
pretty
fair
girl
who
had
recognized
him
also
and
made
him
a
friendly
bow
mademoiselle
zulma
called
the
conductor
it
is
i
she
said
this
way
this
way
my
little
dear
said
the
conductor
with
a
familiarity
which
disgusted
marcel
there
is
no
room
inside
and
to
the
priest
great
delight
he
opened
the
coupé
the
young
girl
seemed
surprised
for
she
hesitated
a
little
and
said
what
in
the
coupé
yes
my
imp
of
satan
in
the
coupé
and
in
good
hands
too
do
you
complain
if
you
are
not
converted
yet
here
are
two
gentlemen
who
will
undertake
your
conversion
well
i
ask
for
nothing
better
she
answered
laughing
and
addressing
herself
to
marcel
will
you
take
my
for
me
he
took
the
box
and
at
the
same
time
offered
his
hand
to
help
her
to
get
up
she
leant
on
it
prettily
and
bowing
to
him
and
to
ridoux
also
she
sat
down
beside
marcel
you
have
come
back
then
into
the
country
mademoiselle
i
have
not
left
it
sir
i
have
been
ill
i
am
coming
out
of
the
hospital
oh
really
and
what
has
been
the
matter
with
you
my
word
i
do
know
i
caught
a
chill
after
an
evening
performance
and
when
i
woke
up
the
next
morning
i
could
not
move
arm
or
leg
my
father
was
obliged
to
leave
me
here
in
the
hospital
they
have
been
very
kind
to
me
and
an
old
gentleman
has
even
paid
my
oh
there
are
good
people
everywhere
and
you
are
going
to
nancy
to
nancy
first
then
i
shall
rejoin
the
company
which
ought
to
be
at
epinal
ridoux
was
listening
in
his
corner
you
know
this
young
person
then
he
said
i
know
her
through
having
seen
her
once
at
althausen
twice
the
young
girl
corrected
him
when
i
arrived
and
when
i
went
away
you
remember
we
were
both
of
us
at
our
window
marcel
remembered
it
very
well
he
remembered
still
better
the
fantastic
sight
in
the
and
the
lascivious
dance
and
the
theatrical
dress
of
the
mountebank
which
had
awakened
all
at
once
the
passion
of
his
feelings
but
as
he
was
afraid
of
allowing
the
young
girl
to
suspect
that
the
memory
of
her
had
left
too
deep
a
mark
upon
him
he
answered
i
do
remember
meanwhile
a
throng
of
beggars
besieged
the
allured
by
the
sight
of
the
two
cassocks
they
recited
all
at
the
same
time
and
in
undefinable
accents
and
in
lamentable
voices
ridoux
and
marcel
with
much
ostentation
distributed
a
few
among
the
most
and
importunate
that
is
to
say
among
the
most
expert
beggars
and
consequently
those
who
least
deserved
attention
then
they
threw
themselves
back
into
the
carriage
and
shut
their
ears
i
have
nothing
more
said
ridoux
i
have
nothing
more
go
and
work
you
set
of
idlers
poor
things
murmured
the
player
no
doubt
among
the
number
there
are
some
who
can
not
work
there
said
ridoux
is
where
the
old
order
of
things
is
ever
to
be
lamented
formerly
there
were
convents
which
fed
all
the
beggars
while
now
these
starving
creatures
will
soon
eat
us
all
up
ah
it
makes
the
heart
bleed
to
see
such
misery
and
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
a
poor
woman
pale
and
sickly
with
a
child
on
her
arm
kept
timidly
behind
the
greedy
crowd
zulma
perceived
her
and
made
her
a
sign
then
taking
a
pie
out
of
her
she
cut
it
into
two
and
gave
her
one
half
you
are
giving
away
your
breakfast
said
marcel
yes
sir
it
is
a
present
from
the
kind
sisters
i
should
have
eaten
it
yesterday
but
i
preferred
to
keep
it
for
you
see
i
have
done
a
good
action
she
added
laughing
i
see
that
the
sisters
were
very
kind
to
you
yes
sir
they
have
converted
me
they
made
me
confess
and
take
the
communion
which
i
had
not
done
for
a
long
time
that
is
well
said
ridoux
the
had
started
again
a
tiny
child
emaciated
in
rags
and
with
bare
feet
was
running
cap
in
hand
he
was
quite
out
of
breath
and
with
a
little
panting
plaintive
voice
he
cried
charity
kind
monsieur
le
curé
charity
if
you
please
go
away
said
ridoux
go
away
little
rascal
mother
is
very
ill
said
the
little
one
there
is
no
bread
at
home
wait
wait
i
am
going
to
point
you
out
to
the
the
child
stopped
short
and
sadly
put
on
his
cap
again
poor
little
fellow
said
the
dancer
and
she
threw
him
the
other
half
of
the
pie
ridoux
thought
he
saw
an
offensive
meaning
in
this
quite
spontaneous
action
for
he
cried
angrily
would
you
tell
us
then
mademoiselle
that
you
have
taken
the
communion
no
doubt
it
was
with
that
piece
of
meat
why
sir
in
what
religion
have
you
been
brought
up
in
the
catholic
religion
is
it
possible
really
you
are
a
catholic
and
you
keep
some
pie
for
your
meals
on
a
on
a
friday
a
friday
he
repeated
with
an
accent
of
the
deepest
indignation
has
not
your
curé
then
taught
that
it
is
forbidden
to
eat
meat
the
day
on
which
our
lord
jesus
christ
died
to
redeem
you
from
your
sins
i
know
it
answered
the
young
girl
colouring
but
we
are
not
able
to
attend
to
religion
much
we
do
not
belong
to
any
parish
what
do
you
mean
by
we
what
is
your
calling
i
am
a
travelling
artiste
sir
a
travelling
artiste
what
is
that
i
dance
character
dances
and
i
appear
in
and
at
your
age
are
you
not
ashamed
to
follow
that
calling
that
is
the
calling
which
i
was
taught
sir
i
know
no
other
replied
the
young
girl
whose
eyes
filled
with
tears
i
have
always
heard
it
said
that
when
we
gain
our
living
honourably
we
have
nothing
to
reproach
ourselves
with
honourably
that
a
fine
word
i
mean
to
say
without
wronging
our
neighbour
and
you
are
talking
nonsense
can
you
think
your
life
is
honourable
when
you
do
not
discharge
even
the
most
elementary
duty
of
a
good
catholic
which
is
to
keep
the
friday
as
a
and
not
only
that
you
encourage
others
in
your
vices
in
short
that
wretched
woman
to
whom
you
have
given
that
piece
of
meat
you
incite
her
to
disobey
the
church
i
did
not
think
of
that
and
that
little
child
he
continued
with
growing
anger
that
little
child
to
whom
you
have
given
this
bad
example
whom
you
lead
into
a
disorderly
life
by
throwing
him
before
two
ecclesiastics
some
pie
on
a
friday
you
have
caused
this
little
child
to
offend
do
you
not
know
then
what
our
lord
jesus
christ
has
said
about
those
who
cause
the
little
children
to
offend
but
you
know
nothing
about
it
do
you
take
heed
of
the
divine
master
words
you
who
at
the
beginning
of
your
life
display
your
youth
in
sinful
dances
for
the
lewd
pleasure
of
i
make
my
living
as
i
can
replied
zulma
wounded
by
the
rebuke
a
fine
way
of
making
your
living
you
would
do
better
to
pray
to
the
holy
virgin
will
the
holy
virgin
give
me
what
i
want
to
eat
ah
they
are
all
like
that
eating
eating
they
only
think
of
eating
it
appeals
that
they
have
said
everything
when
they
have
said
who
will
give
me
to
eat
that
is
the
great
argument
to
excuse
the
lowest
callings
and
work
on
sundays
eating
eating
eh
unhappy
child
and
your
soul
you
must
not
think
only
of
your
body
which
will
be
one
day
eaten
by
worms
your
soul
also
requires
to
eat
marcel
interrupted
uncle
i
ask
you
to
excuse
this
young
person
she
is
ignorant
of
the
duties
of
a
christian
and
it
is
not
her
fault
this
is
a
soul
to
guide
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
not
i
wish
then
that
she
may
find
someone
to
guide
her
thereupon
he
opened
his
breviary
but
he
had
not
finished
the
second
page
of
that
potent
narcotic
before
he
was
sound
asleep
lxxxi
a
little
confession
let
us
not
ask
of
the
tree
what
fruit
it
bears
camille
lemonnier
monsieur
le
curé
is
a
trifle
abrupt
said
marcel
bat
he
has
an
excellent
heart
yes
he
seems
to
be
quickly
offended
it
is
quite
different
with
the
old
gentleman
who
came
to
see
me
at
the
hospital
there
is
a
good
sort
of
a
man
the
chaplain
no
doubt
no
he
is
a
judge
when
i
knew
it
i
was
quite
alarmed
at
it
a
judge
that
makes
one
think
of
the
i
was
quite
in
order
fortunately
besides
he
is
the
president
of
a
great
society
which
enters
everywhere
and
knows
what
is
going
on
everywhere
ah
he
is
a
man
who
frightened
me
very
much
the
first
time
i
saw
him
but
he
is
as
kind
as
can
be
you
are
talking
no
doubt
of
monsieur
tibulle
president
of
the
society
of
vincent
de
paul
and
judge
of
the
court
at
vic
monsieur
tibulle
that
is
he
a
benevolent
man
but
who
does
good
only
to
people
who
are
religious
and
honest
and
as
he
says
as
i
am
an
artiste
the
sister
was
afraid
that
he
would
not
trouble
himself
about
me
but
he
saw
plainly
that
i
was
an
honest
girl
what
do
you
mean
by
honest
girl
she
looked
at
him
attentively
you
know
very
well
she
said
but
it
is
not
enough
to
receive
the
communion
once
by
chance
to
be
honest
was
i
not
obliged
to
go
to
confession
before
ah
i
can
explain
it
all
now
you
have
been
washed
from
your
sins
that
is
well
my
daughter
but
you
must
not
fall
into
them
again
fall
where
into
your
sins
that
will
be
very
hard
said
zulma
with
a
sigh
for
i
commit
so
many
of
them
many
so
young
how
old
are
you
sixteen
sixteen
and
so
already
but
what
are
the
sins
that
you
can
commit
at
sixteen
many
the
curé
of
the
hospital
has
assured
me
so
he
said
to
me
that
i
was
a
cup
of
iniquity
oh
he
has
exaggerated
i
feel
sure
that
he
has
exaggerated
what
sins
do
you
commit
then
i
do
not
say
my
prayers
i
do
not
fast
on
friday
i
do
not
go
to
mass
what
then
others
besides
what
are
they
i
do
not
know
there
are
so
many
which
are
those
that
you
commit
by
preference
the
sins
which
you
have
just
related
to
me
are
infractions
of
the
church
laws
but
the
others
you
do
not
know
what
are
the
sins
which
you
take
pleasure
in
committing
they
all
give
me
pleasure
if
i
sin
it
is
because
it
gives
me
pleasure
is
it
not
if
it
did
not
give
me
pleasure
i
should
not
sin
but
after
all
there
are
pleasures
which
you
love
more
than
others
assuredly
are
not
all
pleasures
sins
all
those
which
are
not
innocent
yes
how
can
i
distinguish
innocent
pleasures
from
those
which
are
not
so
your
conscience
is
the
best
judge
and
when
my
conscience
says
nothing
that
is
not
a
sin
well
monsieur
le
curé
of
the
hospital
has
accused
me
of
a
heap
of
sins
for
which
my
conscience
does
not
reproach
me
at
all
my
child
habit
sometimes
hardens
the
heart
but
you
are
not
of
an
age
to
have
a
hardened
heart
i
feel
certain
that
your
heart
on
the
contrary
is
kind
and
tender
and
that
if
you
commit
faults
it
is
through
ignorance
what
are
then
those
great
faults
must
i
tell
you
them
in
order
to
be
an
honest
girl
yes
i
should
like
to
hear
them
i
might
be
able
to
give
you
some
good
advice
advice
is
not
to
be
despised
particularly
in
your
condition
exposed
as
you
are
young
and
pretty
as
you
are
pretty
you
think
me
pretty
yes
said
marcel
smiling
am
i
the
first
to
tell
you
so
and
do
you
know
it
oh
no
you
are
not
the
first
when
i
am
passing
by
somewhere
or
when
i
am
taking
part
in
the
outside
show
i
often
hear
them
say
eh
the
pretty
girl
but
you
are
the
first
from
whom
it
has
given
me
so
much
pleasure
to
hear
it
is
that
a
sin
too
a
little
sin
of
vanity
but
extremely
pardonable
if
you
have
no
greater
ones
than
that
you
are
really
an
honest
girl
he
looked
at
her
and
smiled
zulma
caught
his
look
and
blushed
where
are
you
going
to
stay
at
nancy
the
gentleman
who
paid
my
fare
gave
me
also
the
address
of
a
house
where
i
can
rest
for
a
day
or
two
while
i
am
waiting
for
news
from
my
company
the
du
cygne
de
la
i
know
it
said
ridoux
who
had
just
woke
up
it
is
a
respectable
house
the
best
which
a
young
person
like
you
could
meet
with
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
you
will
be
welcomed
there
and
at
a
moderate
price
being
recommended
by
the
worthy
monsieur
tibulle
the
mistress
of
the
establishment
is
a
conscientious
lady
and
observing
her
religious
duties
she
is
not
one
who
will
give
you
meat
on
a
friday
monsieur
tibulle
takes
a
great
interest
in
you
then
yes
sir
he
has
even
said
that
if
i
wished
he
would
find
a
more
suitable
position
for
me
but
what
position
could
he
give
me
he
might
find
you
some
he
is
an
influential
man
i
invite
you
to
follow
his
advice
he
is
a
member
of
the
for
the
protection
of
poor
young
but
no
doubt
i
shall
not
see
him
again
then
said
marcel
i
for
my
part
would
wish
to
be
useful
to
you
but
unfortunately
you
are
only
passing
through
and
i
also
am
not
here
for
long
nevertheless
if
for
one
cause
or
another
you
should
have
need
of
anyone
you
understand
a
young
girl
might
find
herself
at
a
loss
in
a
huge
town
you
will
enquire
for
the
abbé
marcel
at
this
address
thanks
sir
they
had
arrived
the
travellers
separated
the
young
girl
with
her
small
amount
of
luggage
directed
her
steps
in
all
confidence
towards
the
inn
which
the
old
member
of
the
society
of
vincent
de
paul
had
acquainted
her
with
while
ridoux
and
marcel
took
their
way
to
the
place
where
resided
the
comtesse
de
montluisant
lxxxii
the
devotion
is
the
sole
resource
of
coquettes
when
they
are
become
old
god
becomes
the
last
resource
of
all
women
who
know
not
aught
else
to
do
mme
de
reux
as
had
foreseen
the
young
curé
pleased
the
old
lady
greatly
she
examined
him
with
satisfaction
and
predicted
that
he
would
make
his
way
you
have
not
deceived
me
she
said
to
ridoux
here
is
a
priest
such
as
we
require
we
are
encumbered
with
awkward
ridiculous
men
who
bring
religion
into
disrepute
why
not
send
all
those
peasants
back
to
their
village
and
select
men
like
monsieur
it
is
a
shame
an
absolute
shame
to
allow
you
to
stagnate
in
this
way
i
shall
reproach
monseigneur
severely
for
it
it
is
the
fault
of
the
gobin
said
ridoux
he
had
taken
a
dislike
to
my
nephew
i
have
known
that
he
was
a
very
harsh
and
a
very
tiresome
man
too
frozen
virtue
which
has
melted
i
am
told
i
do
not
want
to
believe
it
he
is
the
talk
of
the
town
it
is
abominable
but
i
do
not
pity
him
that
is
what
comes
of
not
making
religion
amiable
although
we
are
old
monsieur
marcel
we
are
of
the
new
school
we
firmly
believe
that
religion
and
agreeable
gaiety
ought
to
proceed
in
harmony
we
want
conciliatory
and
amiable
priests
in
this
way
the
women
let
themselves
be
won
over
i
may
confess
it
to
you
i
who
am
double
your
age
and
in
so
far
as
we
shall
have
the
women
the
world
is
ours
while
asking
himself
what
influence
this
more
than
lady
could
exercise
over
the
bishop
decisions
marcel
quickly
perceived
that
in
order
to
be
successful
he
had
only
to
be
in
the
good
graces
of
this
estimable
dowager
and
in
spite
of
the
remembrance
of
suzanne
he
tried
to
be
amiable
and
witty
but
soon
his
ideas
of
ambition
returned
to
him
in
this
sumptuous
surrounded
with
comfort
and
luxury
he
thought
that
he
had
only
to
wish
it
in
order
to
become
himself
too
one
of
the
great
of
the
earth
and
it
appeared
to
him
that
the
comtesse
do
montluisant
ought
to
be
the
instrument
of
a
rapid
fortune
the
old
lady
was
one
of
those
women
very
numerous
in
the
world
who
make
of
religion
a
convenient
chaperone
for
their
intrigues
and
their
affairs
of
gallantry
when
they
are
old
and
can
scarcely
any
longer
on
their
own
account
they
generously
place
their
experience
and
their
small
talents
at
another
service
and
willingly
assist
the
intrigues
of
others
that
is
called
the
and
more
than
once
the
old
lady
had
countenanced
through
perfectly
christian
charity
the
secret
interviews
of
sweet
sheep
with
their
tender
pastor
the
deduction
must
not
be
made
from
this
that
all
the
devout
are
courtesans
when
they
are
young
and
procuresses
in
their
ripened
age
whatever
may
be
said
all
are
not
hypocritical
and
vicious
vice
usually
comes
in
the
long
run
and
hypocrisy
which
oozes
from
the
old
arches
of
the
temples
and
from
the
antique
wainscoting
of
the
sacristies
falls
at
length
upon
their
shoulders
like
an
unwholesome
drizzling
rain
but
for
the
most
part
they
begin
with
conviction
and
good
faith
they
attend
church
frequently
not
only
because
it
is
not
only
through
want
of
occupation
and
through
habit
but
from
inclination
the
melodies
of
the
organ
the
odour
of
incense
the
singing
of
the
choir
the
meditation
and
silence
the
flowers
the
the
gilding
the
pictures
the
mysterious
light
which
filters
through
the
windows
the
radiant
face
of
the
virgin
the
sweet
and
pale
countenance
of
christ
the
statues
of
the
saints
the
niches
the
old
pillars
the
small
chapels
all
this
mystic
poetry
pleases
them
everything
enchants
and
intoxicates
them
even
to
the
sanctimonious
and
hypocritical
face
of
the
beadle
and
the
sacristan
it
is
their
element
their
centre
their
world
they
attach
themselves
to
the
old
nave
as
sailors
attach
themselves
to
their
ship
they
know
all
the
little
corners
and
recesses
of
the
temple
they
have
knelt
at
all
the
chapels
and
burnt
tapers
before
all
the
saints
but
there
is
always
one
place
which
they
have
an
affection
for
and
where
they
are
invariably
to
be
found
why
mystery
what
do
they
do
there
mystery
again
they
remain
there
for
whole
hours
motionless
dreaming
their
eyes
fixed
on
vacancy
their
thoughts
one
knows
not
where
and
in
their
hands
a
book
of
prayers
which
they
open
from
time
to
time
as
if
to
recall
themselves
to
reality
a
young
priest
passes
by
he
recognizes
them
he
bows
and
smiles
to
them
like
old
acquaintances
in
fact
he
sees
them
there
every
day
at
the
same
place
godly
sheep
they
look
at
him
passing
by
and
while
pretending
to
read
their
psalms
they
follow
him
with
that
deep
undefinable
mysterious
look
which
inspires
fear
what
connection
is
there
between
their
prayers
and
reveries
and
the
lively
behaviour
of
this
abbé
how
he
must
laugh
and
how
he
must
inwardly
despise
these
women
who
can
find
no
better
employment
for
the
day
than
to
mutter
devoid
of
meaning
before
an
image
of
wood
or
stone
or
to
remain
in
the
vague
sanctimonious
contemplation
of
a
poor
women
who
better
led
better
instructed
in
their
duties
and
mission
in
life
would
have
become
excellent
mothers
might
have
been
the
light
and
joy
of
some
hearth
which
now
remains
deserted
and
who
lost
and
misled
by
a
false
education
and
a
detestable
system
of
morality
fall
into
wasting
mysticism
hysterical
ecstasies
a
contemplative
and
useless
existence
into
degrading
practices
and
shameful
superstitions
and
instead
of
being
the
fruitful
animating
springs
of
moral
and
social
progress
become
the
passive
instruments
the
unfruitful
of
the
priest
that
is
to
say
the
agents
of
reaction
it
is
they
who
have
caused
thinkers
to
doubt
the
noble
part
which
woman
is
called
to
fulfil
who
have
compelled
proudhon
to
say
woman
is
the
desolation
of
the
just
and
that
other
apostle
of
socialism
bebel
that
she
is
incapable
of
helping
in
the
reconstitution
of
society
of
every
prejudice
affected

every
moral
and
physical
malady
she

the
arab
proverb
says
she
is
a
sick
child
foolishly
spoiled
who
requires
only
to
be
cured
and
reformed
by
another
education
the
comtesse
was
not
like
this
skilful
and
intelligent
she
knew
talking
and
how
to
read
in
wise
eyes
and
between
the
lines
of
letters
therefore
she
had
learnt
in
good
time
how
to
bring
together
two
things
which
the
profane
suppose
to
be
so
opposed
to
one
another
and
which
form
the
secret
of

they
took
a
light
repast
and
it
was
decided
that
marcel
should
repair
to
the
palace
that
very
day
there
is
no
time
to
lose
said
the
comtesse
the
curé
of
marie
is
much
coveted
and
we
have
competitors
in
earnest
there
is
firstly
the
abbé
matou
who
is
supported
by
all
the
fraternity
of
the
sacred
heart
he
is
young
active
wheedling
and
he
is
the
man
i
should
choose
myself
if
i
did
not
know
you
he
has
had
certainly
a
funny
little
story
formerly
with
some
communicants
but
that
is
passed
and
gone
and
as
after
all
he
is
an
intelligent
priest
and
very
ultramontane
monseigneur
would
he
desirous
of
nominating
him
in
order
to
rehabilitate
him
in
public
esteem
he
is
dangerous
now
we
have
little
kock
he
has
rendered
important
services
but
he
is
the
son
of
an
and
he
has
common
manners
let
us
pass
him
by
there
is
yet
the
do
you
know
the
sweet
jesus
abbé
ridoux
yes
it
is
the
abbé
simonet
the
abbé
simonet
said
marcel
i
know
him
we
were
together
at
the
seminary
do
they
call
him
the
sweet
jesus
he
was
a
terrible
lazy
fellow
well
he
is
not
so
among
the
ladies
i
assure
you
they
all
are
madly
in
love
with
him
he
confesses
the
wives
of
the
large
and
small
and
he
has
enough
to
do
the
gentry
used
to
go
to
the
abbé
gobin
now
he
has
gone
away
what
will
become
of
all
the
sinners
of
the
supposing
they
were
all
to
fall
upon
that
poor
simonet
it
is
enough
to
make
one
shudder
dear
when
i
see
him
wandering
in
the
cathedral
with
his
long
fair
hair
and
his
eyes
i
understand
the
infatuation
of
the
women
he
is
nice
enough
to
eat
yes
gentlemen
to
eat
ah
you
do
not
know
as
well
as
we
do
how
religion
gains
by
young
and
handsome
pastors
for
its
interpreters
and
with
what
rapidity
the
holy
flock
increases
it
is
an
astonishing
thing
i
fear
that
we
must
strive
very
hard
against
the
we
will
strive
said
ridoux
and
we
will
employ
every
means
go
dear
abbé
hasten
to
monseigneur
he
is
warned
of
your
visit
and
before
entering
on
the
struggle
it
is
well
to
reconnoitre
the
ground
go
i
have
good
hopes
that
we
shall
have
marie
thus
marcel
found
himself
enlisted
in
spite
of
himself
the
curé
of
marie
was
to
tell
the
truth
perfectly
indifferent
to
him
that
one
or
another
mattered
to
him
but
little
he
had
considered
that
it
was
perhaps
indispensable
that
he
should
quit
althausen
for
the
sake
of
his
reputation
and
the
tranquillity
of
his
heart
his
heart
was
it
then
no
longer
suzanne
more
than
ever
but
he
thought
by
this
time
that
if
there
are
reconciliations
with
heaven
there
were
none
such
with
his
and
that
to
rid
himself
of
her
he
must
first
quit
althausen
suzanne
from
time
to
time
could
come
to
nancy
and
it
was
much
more
easy
and
less
perilous
for
him
to
contrive
interviews
with
her
there
than
in
that
village
where
they
were
spied
upon
by
all
afterwards
they
would
see

at
the

this
world
is
a
great
ball
where
fools
disguised
under
the
laughable
names
of
eminence
and
highness
think
to
swell
out
their
being
and
exalt
their
baseness
in
vain
does
the
equipage
of
vanity
amaze
us
mortals

but
their
mark
is
different
voltaire
sur
marcel
felt
oppressed
at
heart
when
he
put
his
foot
again
for
the
first
time
after
five
years
within
the
episcopal
palace
it
was
there
formerly
five
years
ago
quite
an
abyss
he
had
dreamed
of
a
future
embroidered
with
gold
and
silk
but
it
was
there
also
that
he
had
seen
his
first
illusions
and
his
inmost
beliefs
flee
away
nothing
had
changed
the
palace
was
always
the
same
there
were
the
same
faces
the
same
porter
with
the
wan
complexion
the
same
attendants
at
once
haughty
and
servile
nevertheless
nobody
recognized
him
this
priest
browned
by
the
sun
old
before
his
years
through
disappointment
almost
bent
beneath
the
load
of
his
secret
troubles
was
different
from
the
young
and
brilliant
curate
who
full
of
hope
had
launched
himself
formerly
into
the
illimitable
future
the
lacqueys
of
the
episcopal
palace
saluted
him
respectfully
for
his
good
looks
but
when
he
gave
his
name
they
eyed
from
head
to
foot
with
disdain
and
insolence
this
obscure
country
curé
of
whose
disgrace
they
were
aware
monseigneur
is
much
engaged
said
a
kind
of
de
with
a
sneaking
look
i
do
think
he
can
receive
you
you
will
call
again
monseigneur
has
given
orders
not
to
be
disturbed
then
i
will
wait
wait
if
you
wish
to
replied
the
lacquey
but
you
run
the
risk
of
waiting
a
long
time
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
valet
insolence
marcel
would
no
doubt
have
gone
away
and
perhaps
would
have
abandoned
the
affair
but
humiliated
at
hearing
himself
addressed
in
that
tone
he
became
obstinate
can
you
not
then
inform
monseigneur
that
the
curé
of
althausen
desires
to
speak
with
him
althausen
ah
well
i
believe
that
the
curé
of
mattaincourt
and
monsieur
le
curé
of
the
cathedral
have
called
and
not
been
received
replied
the
valet
consequently
he
added
we
shall
not
disturb
ourselves
for
a
junior
like
you
can
i
speak
with
the
secretary
monsieur
gaudinet
does
not
like
to
be
disturbed
and
i
believe
besides
that
he
is
in
conference
with
his
lordship
marcel
was
aware
that
in
the
episcopal
palace
the
village
curés
are
treated
with
less
regard
than
the
dogs
in
the
therefore
he
took
his
own
part
and
he
had
just
sat
down
on
a
bench
without
saying
a
word
deliberating
with
himself
whether
be
ought
to
wait
or
to
go
away
when
a
little
priest
with
a
busy
and
important
air
with
spectacles
on
his
nose
and
a
pen
behind
his
ear
quickly
crossed
the
anteroom
is
it
not
monsieur
gaudinet
said
marcel
rising
ah
cried
the
former
monsieur
le
curé
of
althausen
i
think
it
was
the
secretary
and
he
aspired
as
may
be
remembered
to
the
envied
post
of
curate
at
nicholas
he
thought
to
obtain
the
good
graces
of
ridoux
by
rendering
a
service
to
marcel
monseigneur
is
really
too
much
engaged
said
he
but
i
will
obtain
admittance
for
you
anyhow
and
he
made
him
go
into
a
small
apartment
next
to
the
bishop
private
cabinet
i
will
call
you
when
it
is
time
he
said
to
him
and
went
out
marcel
left
alone
heard
the
sound
of
a
voice
in
monseigneur
cabinet
and
he
recognized
perfectly
old
collard
he
would
have
been
failing
in
good
clerical
traditions
if
he
had
not
gently
drawn
near
the
door
and
listened
with
all
his
ears
struck
with
amazement
he
heard
the
singular
conversation
which
follows
lxxxv
little
pastimes
one
thing
which
it
is
necessary
to
take
into
account
is
that
they
are
very
precocious
a
french
girl
of
fifteen
is
as
much
developed
as
regards
the
sex
and
love
as
an
english
girl
of
eighteen
this
is
accounted
for
essentially
by
catholic
education
and
by
the
confessional
which
brings
forward
young
girls
to
so
great
an
extent
michelet
let
us
see
little
one
look
me
right
in
the
face
madame
de
montinisant
has
assured
me
that
you
were
very
nice
very
sweet
very
submissive
very
modest
in
fact
ail
the
good
qualities
in
the
superlative
and
that
you
were
worthy
of
entering
into
the
sisterhood
of
the
holy
virgin
in
spite
of
your
youth
is
that
quite
true
yes
monseigneur
ah
ah
it
is
true
do
you
say
i
am
going
to
know
exactly
i
am
going
to
know
if
you
are
truthful
or
not
god
has
bestowed
on
bishops
the
gift
of
divining
everything
did
you
know
that
no
monseigneur
ah
ah
you
are
smiling
you
believe
perhaps
that
it
is
not
true
wait
wait
you
shall
see
indeed
is
it
long
since
she
made
her
first
communion
nearly
two
years
monseigneur
two
years
ah
ah
then
the
little
girl
is
fourteen
only
thirteen
monseigneur
thirteen
thirteen
that
is
very
nice
at
thirteen
one
is
already
a
girl
are
you
already
a
girl
little
rogue
i
do
know
you
do
know
ah
ah
we
are
going
to
see
first
if
you
are
modest
come
close
to
me
see
little
girl
give
me
your
chin
and
this
pretty
little
dimple
oh
oh
you
are
laughing
stay
stay
she
has
some
pretty
little
dimples
on
her
cheeks
too
the
little
naughty
thing
we
are
going
to
make
a
little
confession
ah
you
are
blushing
why
are
you
blushing
you
have
then
some
great
sins
on
your
conscience
come
you
are
going
to
tell
me
all
that
quite
low
in
my
ear
but
monseigneur
there
is
no
it
is
the
condition
qua
of
entering
the
sisterhood
you
understand
that
in
order
to
admit
a
sheep
into
his
flock
the
shepherd
must
be
completely
edified
regarding
that
fresh
sheep
the
sheep
then
must
relate
all
her
wicked
sins
to
her
bishop
it
is
god
who
wills
it
it
is
not
i
little
girl
what
enters
by
one
ear
goes
out
directly
by
the
other
i
should
be
much
puzzled
after
the
confession
to
repeat
a
single
word
of
what
you
have
told
me
you
know
what
a
is
yes
monseigneur
well
the
confessor
ear
is
the
of
the
ear
of
god
has
not
your
confessor
taught
you
that
oh
yes
monseigneur
well
then
we
have
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
and
she
must
not
hesitate
to
confide
to
us
her
little
faults
even
were
there
very
great
sins
i
shall
hear
them
without
making
any
remonstrance
for
that
will
prove
to
me
that
you
have
confidence
in
your
bishop
come
place
yourself
there
near
me
on
your
knees
you
have
no
need
to
recite
your
it
is
only
an
examination
of
conscience
that
we
are
both
going
to
make
there
very
well
put
this
little
cushion
under
your
knees
you
will
be
less
tired
see
where
are
we
going
to
begin
one
god
only
thou
shalt
adore
no
no
that
is
unnecessary
i
am
fully
persuaded
that
you
love
god
and
your
parents
with
all
your
heart
the
goods
of
others
thou
shalt
not
take
ta
ta
ta
i
am
quite
aware
that
you
are
not
a
thief
a
thief
has
not
a
pretty
little
face
like
that
let
us
go
on
at
once
to
the
sixth
commandment
the
works
of
the
flesh
thou
shalt
not
desire
but
in
marriage
only
there
that
is
what
moat
concerns
little
girls
do
you
know
what
are
the
works
of
the
flesh
no
monseigneur
oh
it
is
something
very
abominable
and
i
do
not
know
how
to
explain
it
to
you
nevertheless
in
order
to
know
if
you
have
sinned
against
this
commandment
i
must
make
myself
understood
has
not
your
confessor
already
spoken
to
you
about
it
no
monseigneur
ah
do
not
tell
a
falsehood
it
is
a
mortal
sin
to
tell
a
falsehood
in
confession
who
is
your
confessor
he
is
monsieur
matou
ah
matou
the
abbé
matou
yes

he
has
spoken
to
you
about
it
i
know
him
he
must
have
spoken
to
you
about
it
come

me
all
about
that
well
once
he
asked
me
ah
ah
well
well
do
not
stop
what
is
it
he
asked
you
he
asked
me
ah
it
is
a
long
time
ago
before
my
first
communion
well
he
asked
me
if
i
did
not
go
and
play
with
the
little
boys
and
then
if
i
had
not
culpable
relations
with
them
culpable
relations
with
little
boys
well
and
what
did
you
answer
him
i
answered
him
that
i
had
not
that
you
had
not
was
that
quite
true
do
not
blush
and
do
not
tell
a
falsehood
i
shall
see
if
you
are
going
to
tell
a
falsehood
yes
monseigneur
it
was
quite
true
i
did
not
even
know
what
monsieur
matou
meant
and
you
know
it
now
yes
he
explained
it
to
me
oh
oh
he
explained
it
to
you
and
how
did
he
explain
that
to
you
he
told
me
let
us
see
what
he
told
you
come
come
you
most
not
hang
down
your
head
see
lift
up
this
pretty
face
and
show
me
this
little
dimple
what
did
the
abbé
matou
say
to
you
eh
eh
who
is
there
who
is
knocking
at
the
door
is
it
you
gaudinet
rise
up
my
little
daughter
and
go
and
sit
down
there
in
the
corner
come
in
gaudinet
come
in
then
gaudinet
put
his
head
discreetly
inside
monseigneur
i
came
to
inform
you
that
the
curé
of
althausen
has
been
there
for
some
time
there
where
is
that
in
the
cabinet
what
in
the
cabinet
ah
are
you
mad
gaudinet
to
send
people
in
this
way
into
my
cabinet
i
do
not
approve
of
that
i
do
not
approve
of
that
at
all
what
does
that
curé
of
althausen
want
with
me
lxxxvi
serious
talk
such
were
the
words
of
the
man
of
the
rock
his
authority
was
too
great
his
wisdom
too
deep
not
to
obey
him
chateaubriand
marcel
had
not
heard
these
last
words
at
gaudinet
first
word
he
had
quickly
vanished
foreseeing
that
a
terrible
tempest
would
burst
upon
his
head
if
the
bishop
should
suspect
that
he
had
been
a
witness
of
his
way
of
hearing
little
girls
confessions
the
usual
way
however
of
nearly
all
priests
i
appeal
to
the
memories
of
the
lord
sheep
monsieur
le
curé
cried
gaudinet
opening
the
door
ah
he
is
no
longer
there
he
has
gone
away
monseigneur
i
had
told
him
in
fact
that
your
lordship
was
very
busy
and
no
doubt
he
wished
not
to
trouble
you
i
was
in
fact
expecting
him
he
will
return
but
for
sake
gaudinet
never
let
anybody
enter
that
room
without
warning
me
beforehand
marcel
was
already
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
a
valet
called
him
back
and
gaudinet
after
bringing
out
the
little
girl
introduced
him
to
monseigneur
presence
ah
there
you
are
said
the
latter
in
a
harsh
tone
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
why
did
you
go
away
i
was
told
that
monseigneur
was
engaged
and
i
feared
to
disturb
your
lordship
who
told
you
that
the
abbé
gaudinet
you
are
much
changed
i
should
not
have
recognized
you
i
have
received
a
letter
from
monsieur
le
curé
of
nicholas
he
added
searching
on
his
desk
here
it
is
he
says
that
you
have
returned
to
better
sentiments
that
you
are
amended
humbled
before
god
that
you
wish
henceforth
to
follow
the
good
way
is
that
so
that
is
my
desire
monseigneur
it
is
not
enough
to
desire
sir
you
must
intend
firmly
intend
i
intend
also
i
intend
to
believe
it
i
ask
nothing
better
than
to
oblige
my
old
friend
ridoux
by
doing
something
for
you
sit
down
we
are
in
want
of
priests
that
is
to
say
intelligent
active
priests
on
whom
we
can
absolutely
rely
times
are
becoming
difficult
evil
doctrines
are
spreading
faith
is
passing
away
infamous
writers
wretched
pamphleteers
are
spreading
everywhere
at
so
much
a
line
the
seeds
of
doubt
and
perversity
and
to
crown
the
evil
imprudent
and
maladroit
priests
are
indulging
their
vices
and
creating
scandal
but
we
are
not
discouraged
is
the
holy
arch
in
danger
because
a
few
nails
are
rusty
because
a
few
cords
are
rotten
other
nails
and
cords
are
supplied
in
their
place
and
the
rottenness
is
cast
away
but
we
must
not
hide
from
ourselves
that
we
are
passing
through
a
melancholy
period
this
is
what
priests
for
the
greater
part
do
not
clearly
see
they
slumber
in
their
priesthood
take
their
emoluments
grow
fat
go
their
small
way
and
believe
they
have
discharged
their
duty
that
is
not
the
case
when
a
man
has
the
honour
to
be
a
priest
he
must
be
active
it
is
necessary
as
in
the
time
of
the
persecutions
to
make
proselytes
and
win
souls
to
confront
the
irreligious
propaganda
with
our
propaganda
lampoons
with
lampoons
speeches
with
sermons
acts
with
acts
in
short
we
must
struggle
can
we
remain
still
and
idle
when
our
holy
father
is
imprisoned
in
a
den
of
thieves
the
time
has
come
we
are
fighting
for
our
very
existence
we
must
close
the
ranks
take
count
of
ourselves
and
above
all
see
on
what
and
on
whom
we
can
count
let
us
see
what
we
can
expect
from
you
what
do
you
ask
you
wish
to
come
to
the
town
i
warn
you
that
it
will
be
hard
if
you
intend
to
do
what
i
expect
of
you
the
trouble
does
not
frighten
me
monseigneur
you
will
have
a
difficult
parish
you
will
have
to
run
foul
of
a
thousand
different
interests
and
not
give
the
slightest
pretext
for
slander
you
understand
me
there
are
five
or
six
influential
liberals
whose
wives
or
daughters
you
must
win
over
adroitly
and
at
any
cost
at
any
cost
you
understand
do
you
feel
yourself
qualified
for
this
work
are
you
the
man
we
need
i
will
try
monseigneur
you
will
try
that
is
not
on
answer
it
is
not
enough
to
try
you
most
succeed
we
are
surrounded
with
men
who
commit
nothing
but
follies
while
intending
to
do
well
hell
you
know
is
paved
with
good
intentions
he
looked
at
marcel
attentively
and
the
latter
asked
himself
if
this
were
really
the
man
he
had
heard
only
a
few
moments
before
talking
lightly
with
a
little
girl
you
have
good
manners
continued
the
bishop
you
are
intelligent
i
know
you
will
succeed
therefore
if
you
intend
it
seriously
our
misfortune
is
that
we
are
encumbered
with
dull
and
stupid
peasants
whom
the
seminary
has
been
able
only
partly
to
refine
and
who
render
us
ridiculous
you
must
certainly
have
gone
to
sleep
in
your
village
no
monseigneur
i
have
worked
we
shall
see
that
and
what
sort
of
people
are
they
do
they
perform
their
religious
duties
a
good
and
population
do
they
perform
their
religious
duties
yes
monseigneur
i
was
satisfied
with
them
what
society
very
little
the
lawyer
the
doctor
tolerably
so
and
the
women
much
the
same
as
all
ignorant
and
no
you
were
not
the
man
needed
there
you
would
lose
your
time
and
your
powers
i
will
send
one
of
those
brutes
of
whom
i
have
just
been
speaking
well
go
you
can
tell
the
abbé
ridoux
that
you
will
have
the
cure
come
again
i
even
think
it
will
be
useless
for
you
to
return
to
althausen
lxxxvii
the
seminary
i
turned
my
head
and
i
saw
a
number
of
the
dead
in
living
bodies
these
are
the
worst
spectres
because
they
must
be
subdued
you
touch
them
they
touch
you
and
in
order
to
drag
you
away
to
their
tomb
they
seize
you
with
an
arm
of
flesh
which
is
no
better
than
the
marble
hand
of
the
commendatore
eugene
pelletan
élisée
homme
à
la
recherche
de
marcel
went
away
disconsolate
so
it
was
done
he
was
changed
another
put
in
his
place
at
althausen
he
had
hoped
for
opposition
he
had
counted
on
objections
from
the
bishop
he
thought
in
short
that
he
would
remain
in
suspense
for
some
weeks
perhaps
for
some
months
during
which
he
would
have
the
time
to
look
before
him
and
reflect
but
no
all
at
once
go
and
tell
the
abbé
ridoux
that
you
have
the
cure
well
and
suzanne
could
he
leave
suzanne
in
this
way
he
had
it
is
true
informed
her
of
his
departure
the
day
before
but
had
not
everything
changed
since
the
day
before
could
be
abandon
thus
his
heart
which
he
had
left
behind
there
more
than
his
heart
his
whole
soul
his
life
the
maiden
who
had
yielded
herself
strange
contradictions
when
he
had
believed
his
change
far
distant
and
still
but
slightly
probable
he
had
thought
he
could
leave
suzanne
easily
arrange
far
away
from
her
for
secret
interviews
and
await
events
now
that
this
change
was
certain
and
had
just
become
an
accomplished
fact
he
looked
upon
it
as
a
catastrophe
instead
of
hastening
to
announce
good
to
ridoux
he
proceeded
to
roam
through
the
streets
assailed
by
his
thoughts
and
i
shall
be
obliged
to
live
in
this
world
which
i
have
just
caught
a
glimpse
of
to
elbow
these
men
at
every
hour
to
mingle
in
their
intrigues
to
blend
myself
in
their
life
that
unscrupulous
old
comtesse
that
insolent
prelate
gaudinet
matou
simonet
and
the
rest
all
oozing
forth
hypocrisy
intrigue
and
vice
dreaming
of
one
thing
alone
to
satisfy
their
ambition
their
passions
and
their
appetites
and
these
are
the
ministers
of
god
veronica
was
quite
right
the
same
we
are
all
the
same
all
and
i
am
one
of
the
least
bad
i
was
blind
and
idiotic
not
to
have
cast
my
gaze
earlier
into
this
filthy
blind
idiotic
and
deaf
he
passed
near
a
lofty
gloomy
building
it
was
the
seminary
the
desire
came
upon
him
to
go
in
some
of
his
old
had
remained
there
as
masters
or
professors
but
he
altered
his
mind
what
was
the
good
what
would
he
do
what
would
he
say
to
them
there
was
henceforth
an
abyss
between
him
and
these
men
who
remained
encrusted
in
the
vessel
of
clericalism
the
most
uncrossable
of
all
abysses
that
which
divides
the
thoughts
they
were
perhaps
happy
he
recalled
to
mind
the
long
hours
he
had
passed
beneath
the
sacred
heart
in
the
little
chapel
of
an
evening
amidst
the
the
incense
and
the
flowers
mingling
his
voice
in
exaltation
with
the
voices
of
the
young
levites
and
singing
senseless
hymns
with
his
heart
melting
with
love
of
god
and
he
began
to
envy
those
young
fanatics
whose
blind
and
unintelligent
faith
killed
every
rising
thought
and
who
were
ready
to
suffer
martyrdom
to
support
the
ridiculous
beliefs
which
they
had
been
taught
and
which
they
were
called
upon
to
teach
blind
idiotic
and
deaf
why
am
i
not
so
still
he
said
i
should
believe
myself
the
only
guilty
one
the
only
wicked
and
perverse
one
among
all
those
apostles
i
should
curse
my
weaknesses
and
myself
but
at
least
i
should
have
faith
i
should
walk
onward
with
a
star
upon
my
brow
the
star
of
sublime
follies
which
gives
light
and
life
whereas
i
see
nought
around
me
but
desolation
and
death
i
should
humble
myself
before
the
almighty
and
i
should
cry
to
him
like
the
poet
lord
oh
lord
my
god
thou
art
our
father
pity
for
thou
art
kind
pity
for
thou
art
great
and
instead
of
that
i
am
obliged
to
humble
myself
before
that
bishop
whom
i
despise
to
endure
the
scorn
of
his
lacqueys
and
the
offensive
patronage
of
his
secretary
to
have
the
opportunity
of
saying
little
place
in
your
good
graces
monseigneur
no
a
thousand
times
no
my
village
my
poor
belfry
my
humble
parsonage
my
liberty
and
my
suzanne
by
his
dejected
look
his
uncle
and
the
comtesse
believed
he
had
not
succeeded
too
late
they
cried
the
cure
is
given
away
yes
he
answered
to
whom
to
the
i
wager
ah
the
tartuffe
to
me
and
that
is
why
you
have
a
funereal
expression
yes
uncle
for
i
am
burying
for
ever
my
tranquillity
and
my
happiness
is
it
only
that
madame
la
comtesse
i
present
to
you
the
oddest
and
the
most
extraordinary
man
you
have
ever
met
judge
him
yourself
he
has
just
carried
off
at
the
first
onset
what
he
was
eagerly
desiring
and
there
he
is
as
cheerful
as
a
flogged
donkey
ah
my
dear
madame
how
difficult
it
is
to
benefit
people
in
spite
of
themselves
that
is
my
opinion
also
said
the
comtesse
looking
tenderly
with
her
little
eyes
still
brilliant
in
spite
of
their
long
service
at
the
young
priest
for
whom
she
felt
that
vague
unfruitful
passion
which
old
courtesans
have
for
every
young
and
handsome
man
and
she
made
him
relate
minutely
all
the
details
of
the
interview
bravo
bravo
she
cried
it
is
more
than
i
hoped
but
do
not
alarm
yourself
at
the
difficulties
of
the
task
monseigneur
wishes
to
prove
you
i
am
acquainted
with
the
parish
the
radicals
have
no
influence
there
one
of
them
the
other
day
took
it
into
his
head
to
die
and
in
spite
of
the
protestations
of
some
low
scoundrels
he
has
been
buried
in
the
early
morning
without
drum
or
trumpet
in
the
criminals
hole
two
primary
schools
are
in
our
hands
and
with
a
little
skill
we
shall
have
the
third
how
by
taking
away
all
the
means
of
work
from
the
workmen
who
send
their
children
there
it
is
a
task
monsieur
le
curé
which
is
incumbent
upon
you
and
so
said
marcel
bitterly
i
must
try
to
take
away
their
bread
from
the
fathers
i
suppose
said
ridoux
severely
that
when
the
interest
of
religion
is
in
question
there
is
no
reason
to
hesitate
madame
la
comtesse
pardon
this
young
priest
he
comes
out
from
his
village
and
he
is
still
imbued
with
certain
prejudices
which
we
will
root
out
said
the
old
lady
smiling
that
shall
be
the
task
for
us
women
lxxxviii
the
fair
one
pretty
to
paint
as
graceful
as
an
ear
of
corn
slender
and
yet
robust
never
was
seen
a
morsel
of
flesh
so
delicate
or
better
rounded
her
hair
a
wonderful
fleece
smelt
as
sweet
and
fresh
as
the
grass
and
shone
red
like
the
sun
léon
cladel
de
la
it
was
with
a
great
feeling
of
relief
that
in
the
evening
after
supper
marcel
retired
to
the
room
which
in
spite
of
his
protests
the
countess
had
caused
to
be
made
ready
for
him
he
had
need
to
be
alone
events
had
hurried
on
in
such
an
astounding
and
rapid
manner
and
he
had
had
no
time
to
think
about
them
his
resolution
was
fully
taken
he
would
refuse
the
new
core
the
odious
part
which
he
was
called
upon
to
play
there
decided
him
he
was
about
to
shatter
his
future
it
meant
a
disagreement
with
his
uncle
the
hatred
of
this
influential
woman
the
formidable
persecution
of
the
bishop
but
what
was
all
that
he
saw
suzanne
again
amiable
gracious
smiling
looking
at
him
with
her
soft
dark
eyes
suzanne
approving
of
his
conduct
and
saying
to
him
you
are
a
man
of
courage
let
us
go
away
together
cast
your
frock
into
the
ditch
and
he
wrote
three
letters
one
to
his
uncle
the
other
to
the
comtesse
and
the
third
to
the
bishop
entreating
them
to
excuse
him
and
telling
them
that
he
did
not
feel
qualified
to
perform
his
ministry
in
a
large
town
he
implored
monseigneur
to
leave
him
at
althausen
and
to
think
no
more
about
him
but
the
night
brings
counsel
and
when
he
woke
up
the
next
morning
and
saw
his
three
letters
on
the
table
he
thought
that
he
could
not
do
a
more
awkward
thing
he
threw
them
in
the
fire
dressed
and
went
out
the
idea
came
to
him
of
going
to
see
the
parish
which
was
destined
for
him
he
followed
the
streets
drawn
in
a
straight
line
of
that
too
regular
city
and
when
he
arrived
at
the
corner
of
the
des
he
heard
his
name
pronounced
be
turned
round
and
saw
the
landlord
of
the
inn
where
he
was
accustomed
to
stay
when
he
came
to
nancy
what
you
are
passing
before
my
door
without
coming
in
monsieur
le
curé
i
was
expecting
you
however
i
had
prepared
your
room
you
were
expecting
me
monsieur
patin
and
who
told
you
that
i
was
here
who
told
me
that
it
was
a
young
person
who
is
very
pretty
upon
my
word
she
came
to
ask
for
you
yesterday
evening
and
we
expected
you
up
to
ten
dark
said
marcel
much
disturbed
no
fair
the
prettiest
fair
complexion
which
i
have
ever
seen
marcel
remembered
immediately
the
little
mountebank
whom
he
had
altogether
forgotten
and
to
whom
he
had
given
the
address
of
monsieur
patin
hotel
where
he
had
expected
to
stay
it
is
a
young
girl
who
is
recommended
to
me
he
said
i
regret
that
i
did
not
see
her
you
are
not
coming
in
no
for
perhaps
i
am
going
to
set
out
again
for
althausen
for
althausen
that
is
impossible
i
have
just
seen
the
go
by
come
you
will
sleep
once
more
at
my
house
monsieur
marcel
your
room
is
quite
ready
and
my
wife
who
has
a
fancy
for
you
will
not
let
you
go
away
stay
here
she
comes
she
has
recognized
your
voice
the
little
madame
patin
plump
brown
active
and
pretty
hastened
up
indeed
and
compelled
marcel
to
come
in
almost
in
spite
of
himself
you
shall
remain
you
shall
remain
she
said
to
him
relieving
him
of
his
hat
no
he
answered
smiling
i
shall
not
remain
and
i
will
tell
you
the
reason
i
came
with
my
uncle
and
i
have
my
room
at
madame
de
montluisant
before
that
declaration
monsieur
and
madame
patin
bowed
ah
that
is
not
right
said
madame
patin
madame
de
montluisant
is
opposing
us
she
is
drawing
our
clients
to
her
house
my
dear
have
you
told
monsieur
marcel
that
a
young
person
has
come
your
husband
has
told
me
madame
and
that
proves
to
you
that
i
certainly
had
the
intention
of
staying
with
you
since
i
showed
her
your
address
it
had
escaped
my
memory
otherwise
i
should
have
called
to
ask
you
to
send
the
young
person
to
madame
de
montluisant
she
will
certainly
come
back
again
for
she
seemed
very
desirous
of
seeing
you
must
i
send
her
to
you
at
that
lady
no
but
tell
her
to
come
again
this
evening
late
i
have
a
thousand
things
to
do
and
i
can
scarcely
see
any
moment
but
that
when
i
shall
be
free
that
evening
at
eight
he
was
at
monsieur
patin
where
he
found
a
good
fire
in
a
small
well
closed
with
the
newspapers
and
a
cup
of
coffee
the
young
girl
had
called
again
during
the
day
and
would
return
marcel
installed
himself
comfortably
in
an
and
waited
for
her
he
had
seen
the
bishop
again
who
had
flashed
before
his
eyes
a
future
full
of
golden
rays
the
visit
of
ridoux
and
the
comtesse
had
preceded
his
own
and
in
the
sudden
change
of
manner
of
the
prelate
towards
him
he
recognized
the
good
offices
of
his
new
friend
a
good
dinner
had
completed
the
happy
day
and
life
appeared
to
him
after
all
to
have
some
sweetness
lxxxix
love
again
oh
folly
which
we
call
love
what
dost
thou
make
of
us
out
of
thou
dost
make
us
slaves
thou
dost
breathe
into
us
all
the
vices
it
is
thou
who
dost
supply
the
altars
of
disloyalty
and
fear
it
is
thou
who
dost
extract
from
thought
the
art
and
from
enthusiasm
a
vile
profession
how
many
young
people
have
you
blighted
all
the
fairest
ah
siren
thy
voice
is
sweet
thou
speakest
to
us
the
language
of
the
gods
but
thou
are
only
an
impure
beast
jean
laroque
a
kind
of
emotion
seized
him
he
was
almost
ashamed
of
it
and
tried
to
give
an
account
of
it
to
himself
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
affected
as
if
at
the
approach
of
sin
he
restrained
his
feelings
and
enquired
of
himself
what
this
young
girl
could
want
with
him
perhaps
she
was
but
a
common
courtesan
who
attracted
by
the
handsome
appearance
and
tender
look
of
the
priest
counted
on
speculating
profitably
in
a
clandestine
intrigue
nevertheless
he
was
not
terrified
at
the
prospect
and
he
recalled
complacently
the
scene
in
the
open
air
in
the
at
althausen
with
his
eyes
closed
he
saw
her
again
playing
the
castanets
rounding
her
hips
and
shooting
forward
her
little
foot
in
order
to
make
the
enraptured
rustics
admire
the
sculptural
beauty
of
her
leg
he
saw
again
that
bosom
free
from
all
covering
which
had
plunged
him
into
such
confusion
ah
if
instead
of
his
love
for
suzanne
so
full
of
fever
and
danger
he
had
picked
up
on
his
way
some
pretty
girl
like
this
bohemian
who
while
calming
his
feelings
would
have
left
his
heart
in
peace
with
a
common
peasant
girl
vigorous
and
sensual
like
this
dancer
at
the
fair
he
would
have
gratified
the
only
low
permissible
to
a
priest
for
it
was
the
most
unpardonable
folly
he
recognized
now
to
surrender
his
heart
the
curé
of
nicholas
was
a
thousand
times
right
let
the
priest
make
use
of
woman
nothing
is
more
proper
as
an
instrument
as
a
pastime
hygienic
and
aperient
but
let
him
stop
there
at
certain
periods
when
the
brain
is
heavy
the
digestion
is
inactive
and
the
bowels
are
confined
when
dizziness
occurs
when
the
blood
becoming
too
plentiful
grows
thick
and
congested
in
the
veins
and
rises
to
the
head
then
it
is
that
nature
needs
to
accomplish
her
work
then
one
seeks
for
a
woman
one
throws
oneself
on
her
who
happens
to
be
there
and
is
willing
to
lend
herself
to
this
hygienic
and
benevolent
part
servant
or
mistress
girl
or
wife
lady
or
young
or
old
courtesan
from
a
or
the
pavement
one
takes
her
has
one
pleasure
of
her
and
goes
away
but
to
love
long
to
make
of
the
woman
the
aim
of
our
life
the
spring
of
our
actions
the
ideal
of
our
existence
to
believe
in
happiness
together
to
put
faith
in
these
fragile
vain
and
ignorant
dolls
what
trickery
to
believe
in
happiness
through
love
dream
of
the
it
is
permissible
to
the
neophyte
who
puts
on
for
the
first
time
the
white
surplice
and
the
golden
chasuble
with
so
much
joy
and
pride
the
sweet
young
girls
the
youthful
wives
the
grave
matrons
regard
you
with
softened
eyes
then
you
have
faith
you
have
confidence
you
see
the
future
illumined
by
angels
with
virgin
bodies
who
murmur
mysterious
words
in
your
ear
which
melt
your
heart
you
dare
hardly
lift
your
eyes
and
you
say
to
yourself
which
one
shall
i
love
in
this
legion
of
seraphims
oh
i
will
love
them
all
all
presumptuous
youth
which
doubts
of
nothing
but
when
you
have
loved
one
two
three
of
them
afterwards
afterwards
after
having
experienced
the
nothingness
of
all
these
trifles
of
all
these
follies
of
the
heart
of
all
these
caprices
of
the
imagination
of
all
these
abortions
of
the
thought
of
all
these
voids
of
the
soul
of
all
these
impurities
of
the
body
of
all
the
uncleanness
of
the
woman
with
whom
you
are
satiated
and
whose
couch
you
are
leaving
then
go
and
speak
of
eternal
love
oh
how
right
diogenes
was
to
call
love
a
short
epilepsy
how
right
that
imperial
sophist
of
the
decline
to
call
it
a
convulsion
and
the
first
bonaparte
an
affair
of
the
sopha
thus
marcel
moralized
like
an
old
prelate
coming
out
from
a
closed
room
when
some
filthy
scene
has
been
enacted
the
fact
is
that
for
some
time
he
had
been
the
hero
of
a
comedy
and
of
a
drama
the
grotesque
comedy
which
he
had
unrolled
with
his
servant
the
terrible
drama
in
which
he
saw
himself
involved
with
suzanne
durand
and
he
was
wearied
and
satiated
the
satisfaction
of
his
senses
left
him
by
way
of
retaliation
shame
trouble
and
fear
daniel
defoe
has
written
in
his
admirable
book
from
how
many
mysterious
sources
opposed
one
to
the
other
do
not
different
circumstances
cause
our
passions
to
proceed
we
hate
in
the
evening
what
we
cherished
in
the
morning
we
avoid
what
we
sought
for
yesterday
we
desire
an
object
passionately
and
a
few
moments
after
we
shall
not
know
how
to
endure
the
idea
of
it
thus
marcel
was
cursing
love
when
zulma
came
and
knocked
at
his
door
xc
le
cygne
de
la
croix
as
soon
as
she
comes
the
hostess
looks
hard
my
beauty
no
ceremony
the
supper
is
ready
come
in
come
in
my
beauty
come
in
and
no
more
noise
with
three
gallant
captains
you
shall
spend
the
night
songs
of
madame
connard
a
widow
and
the
landlady
of
the
cygne
de
la
croix
a
godly
and
person
made
a
significant
grimace
when
she
saw
a
young
girl
quietly
dressed
entering
her
house
with
no
other
luggage
than
an
old
but
when
she
handed
her
the
card
of
monsieur
tibulle
judge
of
the
court
at
vic
president
of
the
society
of
vincent
de
paul
and
member
of
the
committee
for
the
protection
of
poor
young
girls
her
grimace
changed
into
a
gracious
smile
she
soon
gave
her
a
room
and
asked
her
what
she
wanted
to
eat
informing
her
however
that
it
was
a
and
that
consequently
she
had
not
much
choice
whatever
you
like
said
the
dancer
i
am
convalescent
i
have
a
good
appetite
and
i
accommodate
myself
to
everything
do
give
then
the
best
which
you
have
but
the
cheapest
the
little
thing
is
sharp
thought
madame
connard
and
she
added
aloud
a
young
lady
recommended
by
monsieur
tibulle
need
not
fear
that
she
will
want
for
anything
consider
what
you
would
like
my
little
dear
and
disturb
yourself
about
the
rest
and
since
you
are
ill
the
church
allows
us
to
give
you
meat
to
eat
she
went
out
in
the
meantime
and
an
hour
afterwards
she
herself
served
a
dinner
which
would
have
made
the
most
greedy
of
curates
envious
and
washed
down
with
that
light
wine
acrid
but
heady
which
the
slopes
of
the
meurthe
produce
the
dancer
like
a
true
child
of
bohemia
dined
heartily
and
without
needing
to
be
asked
she
was
at
her
coffee
when
she
heard
a
whispering
in
the
corridor
and
a
little
cracked
voice
which
said
i
am
a
little
late
dear
madame
but
i
have
been
kept
by
monseigneur
has
the
little
one
behaved
well
like
an
angel
monsieur
tibulle
and
a
demon
for
beauty
yes
yes
this
will
be
a
fine
acquisition
for
the
church
a
soul
snatched
from
satan
dear
madame
snatched
from
satan
we
shall
make
something
of
her
ah
how
happy
you
gentlemen
are
to
snatch
in
this
way
pretty
little
souls
from
hell
we
poor
women
have
not
that
power
but
you
prepare
the
ways

open
them
dear
madame
connard
everything
has
its
purpose

purpose

purpose
well
monsieur
tibulle

to
yours

is
number
i
leave
you
and
she
quietly
the
door
of
no
into
which
monsieur
glided
like
a
shadow
saying
in
his
tremulous
voice
eh
eh
it
is
i

my
little
dear

to

little
queen

madame
connard
put
her
head
in
for
an
instant
smiled
and
cautiously
closed
the
door
he
is
still
pretty
young
for
his
age
she
said
to
herself

forward

lot
of
strings
under
their
petticoats

sometimes
there

knots

know
that
so

it
but
i
do

i
tell
you
nevertheless
just
to
show
me
your
calves
your
fine
big
calves
you
have
seen
them

what
cried
monsieur
tibulle
indignant
at
length
at
such
obstinacy
you
refuse
to
show
to
me
what
you
exhibit
in
public
to
everybody
in
the
in
the
streets
to
the
first
who

when
i
am
all
alone
in
this
little
room
where
nobody
sees
us
ah

is
very
wrong
wrong
wrong

intend
to
punish
you
for
that
naughty
act
in
public
that
is
my
profession
and
besides
i
have
a
costume
she
is
nice
enough
to
eat
a
costume
if
you
only
want
that
it
is
very
easy
to
find
i
know
of
a
little
costume
very
nice
and
not
dear
and
if
you
like
we
will
both
of
us
put
it
on
what
is
it
that
which
god
gave
us
it
is
the
best
of
all
and
besides
it
is
that
which
will
become
you
the
best
ah
my
little
dear
nothing
is
equal
to
the
gifts
of
god
and
all
the
fripperies
of
women
will
never
serve
them
as
well
as
the
simple
attire
of
our
first
mother
we
are
going
then
to
try
the
costume
of
adam
and
eve
does
that
suit
you

your
calves

it
is
eve

long
since

of
the
forbidden
fruit

it
not
you
little
rogue

me
alone

ask
you

quick
into
the
costume
of
your
part
i
will
play
adam
and
you
shall
see
what
a
fine
apple
we
will
eat
sir
a
man
of
your
age
old
men
are
always
more
amorous
than
the
young
ones
you
will
see
you
will
see
i
do
want
to
see
anything
let
me
go
go
and
where
do
you
want
to
go
to
a
man
does
not
let
a
little
duck
like
you
go
away
when
he
has
hold
of
her
for
i
have
you
you
little
rogue
yes
yes
i
have
you
listen
we
will
go
away
morning
each
our
own
way
neither
seen

known
and
i
assure
you
that
you
will
be
satisfied
my
wife
does
not
expect
me
till
your
wife
what
you
are
married
does
that
surprise
you
my
wife
is
an
old
who

good
for
nothing
more
therefore
i
make
no
more
use
of
her
come

be
quick
into
the
costume
of
eve
and
if
you
absolutely
keep
to
it
i
will
fasten
a
on
to
you
but
zulma
was
not
the
girl
to
allow
herself
to
be
forced
in
this
way
and
the
worthy
old
man
who
wanted
to
add
deeds
to
words
received
a
vigorous
slap
on
the
face
he
stopped
quite
confused
and
rubbed
his
cheek
she
has
a
strong
wrist
he
said
who
would
suspect
that
such
a
little
hand
could
hit
so
hard
but
the
ice
is
broken
now
and
you
are
going
to
pay
me
for
it
xcii
the
scapular
and
the
old
bearded
fellow
rubbed
away
pushed
with
his
hips
embracing
her
in
front
clasped
with
his
arms
embracing
her
behind
stuffing
at
the
chancellery
throwing
her
gently
and
collecting
his
strength
labouring
with
his
chest
and
even
tripping
her
up
he
made
use
of
all
léon
cladel
i
shall
scream
said
zulma
who
was
defending
herself
valiantly
i
shall
scream
if
you
do
not
loose
me
scream
as
much
as
you
will
said
the
holy
man
as
he
recovered
breath
here
the
walls
are
deaf
and
you
will
have
to
deal
with
me
i
just
laugh
at
you
you
old
punch
old
punch
punch
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
you
insult
me
take
care
let
me
go
directly
or
i
shall
know
whom
to
complain
to
ah
you
assume
that
tone
you
want
to
make
a
complaint
do
you
and
to
whom
you
little
wretch
to
whom
it
may
concern
ah
what
a
fine
expression
you
have
learnt
by
heart
who
is
it
may
i
do
not
know
him
whoever
he
may
be
it
may
will
laugh
in
your
face
you
a
daughter
of
the
streets
a
a
clown
a
ragged
slut
you
would
lodge
a
complaint
against
me
surely
you
do
not
know
who
i
am
i
am
an
honourable
man
known
everywhere
respected
everywhere
come
you
see
clearly
that
you
are
talking
nonsense
be
more
reasonable
again
what
it
pleases
me
to
cast
my
eyes
upon
you
to
want
to
pass
a
little
while
with
you
agreeably
i
honour
you
by
stooping
myself
to
a
girl
of
your
kind
and
you
refuse
and
are
fastidious
has
one
ever
seen
such
a
thing
it
is
enough
to
make
god
laugh
come
come
now
not
so
many
affectations
for
the
lost
time
how
much
do
you
want
a
hundred
francs
you
horrify
me
let
me
go
away
he
cast
a
fearful
look
upon
her
and
said
with
a
laugh
which
chilled
her
blood
oh
you
want
to
go
away
well
how
about
the
money
i
have
spent
on
you
and
on
your
journey
your
money
i
did
not
ask
you
for
it
but
i
will
let
you
have
it
back
again
be
assured
when
i
have
worked
and
earned
it
and
you
believe
that
i
shall
be
satisfied
with
this
fine
promise
you
will
let
me
have
my
money
back
immediately
or
i
shall
certainly
accuse
you
of
being
a
thief
an
adventuress
i
will
say
what
happened
it
was
you
who
compelled
me
to
take
the
money
for
the
i
make
you
a
present
of
that
but
you
will
have
to
pay
all
that
you
have
spent
here
if
not
you
will
be
put
in
prison
you
understand
little
do
you
think
people
are
going
to
keep
you
and
let
you
enjoy
yourself
for
nothing
and
who
has
told
you
that
i
shall
not
pay
replied
zulma
struck
by
the
logic
of
this
objection
then
you
will
pay
immediately
said
the
worthy
man
for
i
have
been
answerable
for
you
and
it
is
on
my
recommendation
that
they
have
received
a
trollop
like
you
into
this
respectable
house
madame
connard
he
cried
at
the
door
dear
madame
connard
will
you
bring
up
the
bill
the
little
bill
madame
connard
appeared
at
once
what
mademoiselle
is
going
away
is
she
not
sleeping
here
no
mademoiselle
is
going
to
try
her
fortune
elsewhere
madame
connard
handed
the
bill
to
monsieur
tibulle
no
no
it
is
mademoiselle
who
is
going
to
settle
it
this
young
lady
zulma
glanced
at
it
and
grew
pale
she
had
hardly
francs
and
the
bill
amounted
to
francs
centimes
and
besides
it
is
so
little
because
it
is
you
everything
is
so
dear
here
and
one
does
not
know
what
to
do
for
a
living
the
poor
girl
remained
silent
she
looked
at
the
bill
without
seeing
it
for
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
well
said
monsieur
tibulle
in
a
wheedling
tone
is
there
some
little
hindrance
to
your
settling
that
madame
said
zulma
i
have
not
enough
money
with
me
no
i
do
not
believe
i
have
enough
money
but
i
can
find
it
i
know
where
to
find
it
and
in
an
hour
or
two
oh
oh
cried
madame
connard
in
an
hour
or
two
that
is
a
very
fine
tale
but
i
know
it
my
girl
and
people
do
tell
me
that
sort
of
thing
well
dear
madame
i
leave
you
said
monsieur
tibulle
making
her
a
knowing
sign
i
am
going
to
see
if
my
horse
is
put
to
for
i
am
setting
off
directly
little
one
no
malice
well
mademoiselle
said
madame
connard
what
do
you
decide
i
have
told
you
madame
i
can
give
you
five
or
six
francs
and
although
it
is
a
downright
robbery
i
will
find
you
the
rest
a
robbery
you
little
thief
you
little
hussy
you
dare
to
call
me
a
thief
you
little
you
are
going
to
pay
me
immediately
or
i
will
hand
you
over
to
the
police
very
well
call
the
police
if
you
wish
i
ask
for
nothing
better
i
will
relate
what
has
occurred
she
considered
no
doubt
that
she
was
wrong
for
she
cried
look
that
is
not
all
pay
me
immediately
and
take
yourself
off
somewhere
else
has
one
ever
seen
anything
like
you
believed
perhaps
that
i
was
going
to
lodge
you
and
keep
you
for
your
pretty
face
no
my
dear
i
have
been
done
already
in
that
way
and
you
do
catch
me
any
more
there
was
a
respectable
gentleman
very
polite
rich
and
wearing
a
red
ribbon
who
was
answerable
for
you
if
you
had
been
willing
to
make
an
arrangement
with
him
but
instead
of
making
an
arrangement
with
him
you
have
a
dispute
so
much
the
worse
for
you
your
family
quarrels
do
concern
me
what
i
want
is
the
money
that
is
all
that
i
know
pay
me
my
bill
and
get
out
you
little
prostitute
come
dear
madame
i
will
try
and
arrange
this
little
matter
said
monsieur
tibulle
appearing
again
the
little
one
is
going
to
think
better
of
it
i
feel
sure
let
me
reason
with
her
madame
connard
withdrew
complacently
you
see
you
see
in
what
a
position
you
are
placing
yourself
said
the
excellent
old
gentleman
crossing
his
arms
and
looking
at
the
young
girl
with
all
the
dignity
and
sorrow
of
a
father
who
has
detected
his
child
in
some
shameful
act
say
rather
into
what
an
ambush
you
have
driven
me
you
old
scoundrel
oh
oh
oh
no
bad
word
my
girl
bad
words
are
no
use
i
am
going
away
to
pay
the
bill
a
fig
for
you
and
your
money
what
a
fig
for
me
and
my
money
in
the
first
place
you
should
never
despise
money
my
girl
we
can
do
nothing
without
money
in
this
world
and
then
you
are
wrong
to
despise
me
who
only
wish
you
well
my
dear
yes
yes
wish
you
well
i
tell
you
to
leave
me
alone
look
now
do
be
naughty
for
i
am
going
to
settle
the
matter
i
do
want
you
do
touch
me
and
how

going
to
get
yourself
out
of
this
scrape
if
you
will
not
let
me
get
you
out

rebuff
me
again
though
i
only
want
to
make
you
happy

tell
you
not
to
come
near
me

pacified
you
little
angry
cat
only
a
kiss
and
that
shall
be
all
he
wanted
to
take
hold
of
her
waist
but
she
pushed
him
back
but
he
had
gone
too
far
to
believe
that
he
ought
to
beat
a
retreat
and
he
retained
to
the
charge
with
renewed
vigour
in
the
struggle
she
seized
him
by
the
neck
his
waistcoat
came
undone
and
a
little
square
bit
of
painted
canvas
of
a
dubious
colour
remained
in
her
hand
she
threw
it
back
in
his
face
in
disgust
my
scapular
he
cried
you
throw
my
scapular
about
in
this
way
stay
you
are
a
little
wretch
a
a
hussy
a
reprobate
you
will
perish
miserably
and
i
leave
you
to
your
fate
ah
you
throw
away
my
scapular
when
he
had
said
this
the
good
gentleman
piously
recovered
his
scapular
buttoned
up
his
overcoat
and
retired
full
of
dignity
xciii
from
the
dark
to
the
fair
moderation
should
preside
over
pleasure
let
us
seek
in
new
pleasures
a
refuge
against
the
satiety
of
our
souls
kalvos
de
zante
zulma
had
remembered
marcel
and
had
gone
to
him
boldly
you
have
been
crying
then
my
child
said
the
priest
who
noticed
her
red
eyes
the
young
girl
in
a
few
words
informed
him
of
her
adventure
who
would
ever
have
believed
that
she
said
such
a
kind
man
such
an
obliging
lady
the
old
gentleman
said
to
me
at
vic
i
shall
not
concern
myself
about
you
if
you
do
not
go
to
confession
if
you
do
not
receive
the
communion
if
you
do
not
say
your
prayers
whom
can
one
trust
and
that
madame
connard
eat
what
you
like
and
do
stand
on
ceremony
monsieur
tibulle
wishes
it
so
old
men
are
made
to
pay
and
with
all
these
fine
words
i
owe
her
ten
marcel
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
girl
artlessness
then
you
have
come
to
ask
me
for
them
yes
said
zulma
blushing
have
i
not
done
right
she
has
kept
my
the
old
thief
what
it
contains
is
not
worth
ten
but
i
do
want
to
leave
it
with
her
and
what
will
you
give
me
in
exchange
everything
you
want
that
is
a
great
deal
to
promise
but
you
have
nothing
it
is
true
i
have
nothing
she
said
piteously
well
i
will
kiss
you
and
will
love
you
very
much
one
may
kiss
a
curé
may
one
not
marcel
thought
she
was
getting
to
business
very
quickly
priests
do
not
receive
kisses
from
anybody
he
replied
from
nobody
not
even
from
a
sister
but
you
are
not
my
sister
well
i
will
be
your
comrade
no
more
do
they
have
a
comrade
oh
well
if
i
were
a
man
i
should
not
like
to
be
in
your
position
one
must
get
awfully
tired
of
being
all
alone
what
are
you
able
to
do
all
the
blessed
day
for
my
part
in
the
first
place
i
must
have
a
lover
ha
ha
and
who
is
your
lover
a
rider
at
the
loyal
circus
a
handsome
boy
too
a
tall
dark
fellow
like
you
he
is
a
little
too
proud
but
i
like
that
in
a
man
and
for
how
long
has
he
been
your
lover
ever
since
i
have
seen
him
it
is
nearly
two
years
ago
at
the
fête
at
mirecourt
our
booth
was
beside
the
circus
two
years
cried
marcel
but
at
what
age
did
you
begin
begin
what
to
dance
on
the
to
have
lovers
but
i
have
only
had
one
and
that
is
he
well
how
old
were
you
when
you
had
him
i
have
never
had
him
look
dear
child
you
have
told
me
that
you
are
sixteen
yes
sir
then
you
began
at
fourteen
began
what
with
your
lover
we
never
began
anything
i
have
told
you
that
he
was
too
proud
i
wanted
to
speak
to
him
once
and
he
answered
go
along
but
he
is
not
your
lover
but
he
is
because
i
love
him
and
you
have
not
had
others
no
because
i
love
him
well
you
are
a
good
girl
and
if
what
you
have
said
is
true
you
are
worth
your
weight
in
gold
my
weight
in
gold
cried
zulma
laughing
then
buy
me
for
it
is
true
and
i
shall
be
rich
but
how
shall
i
know
if
what
you
say
is
true
ah
that
is
embarrassing
she
said
thoughtfully
what
can
i
do
to
prove
it
i
believe
you
without
proof
but
i
am
not
rich
enough
to
pay
you
it
does
matter
to
you
i
give
myself
for
nothing
marcel
was
bewildered
and
hurriedly
gave
her
the
ten
how
kind
you
are
i
should
like
all
the
same
to
do
something
for
you
you
wish
to
please
me
well
remain
good
only
that
and
till
when
until
i
give
you
permission
not
to
be
so
any
longer
i
will
certainly
she
took
a
few
steps
towards
the
door
opened
it
then
turning
back
suddenly
she
advanced
her
bust
as
though
she
were
making
a
bow
to
the
crowd
and
placing
the
tips
of
her
fingers
on
her
lips
she
wafted
a
gracious
kiss
to
the
priest
there
is
pleasant
and
easy
said
marcel
to
himself
why
did
i
not
know
it
sooner
he
ran
to
the
door
wait
my
child
where
are
you
going
to
sleep
it
is
late
have
you
a
lodging
stay
my
word
no
i
had
forgotten
it
this
is
what
you
will
do
first
settle
your
account
with
this
landlady
without
making
allusion
to
anything
a
scandal
must
always
be
avoided
monsieur
tibulle
is
a
man
highly
esteemed
with
a
considerable
position
in
the
world
and
anything
you
might
say
against
him
would
only
turn
against
you
do
not
tell
this
story
then
to
anybody
and
do
not
tell
anybody
that
you
know
me
now
take
these
two
my
dear
child
and
buy
yourself
a
few
little
articles
of
dress
you
must
be
dressed
properly
go
and
come
back
here
monsieur
patin
the
landlord
appeared
monsieur
patin
said
marcel
i
confide
this
young
person
to
you
or
rather
to
madame
patin
here
she
has
been
recommended
specially
to
me
by
some
ladies
of
high
rank
she
is
going
to
fetch
her
small
articles
of
luggage
and
will
soon
be
back
again
be
careful
of
her
give
her
a
room
and
her
meals
i
am
answerable
for
her
mademoiselle
i
shall
see
you
again
what
were
marcel
intentions
had
he
felt
the
appetite
for
the
unknown
awakening
he
who
had
just
poured
forth
his
bitterness
upon
woman
and
upon
love
had
be
come
to
the
conclusion
in
the
presence
of
this
stranger
that
he
could
not
do
without
woman
or
without
love
but
the
other
the
other
was
not
there
and
the
absent
are
in
the
wrong
could
this
one
make
him
forget
the
other
could
a
new
fancy
destroy
the
strong
love
which
bound
him
and
was
ruining
him
could
a
love
facile
and
without
risk
soothe
the
hidden
mischief
and
diminish
the
fury
of
a
dangerous
passion
she
had
all
that
was
required
for
that
this
little
fair
girl
with
the
tempting
lips
like
suzanne
she
was
young
and
charming
like
suzanne
she
would
be
loving
and
unlike
suzanne
she
would
be
submissive
her
eyes
swimming
in
their
azure
her
aquiline
nose
with
its
mobile
nostrils
her
scarlet
fleshly
lips
her
golden
hair
like
ripened
corn
her
rosy
cheeks
in
which
coursed
health
and
life
the
slimness
of
her
waist
the
delicacy
and
whiteness
of
her
hand
it
all
said
love
me
and
she
was
a
fresh
woman
a
fresh
woman
eternal
temptation
when
he
returned
to
the
hotel
he
found
the
comtesse
anxiously
waiting
for
him
with
a
smile
she
handed
a
large
packet
sealed
with
the
episcopal
arms
it
was
his
nomination
to
the
curé
of
marie
he
would
have
to
take
possession
of
it
immediately
xciv
the
change
prayer
on
that
day
is
said
within
the
gothic
church
the
old
men

beneath
the
ancient
oak

are
the
games
but
just
begun
the
village
maidens
will
no
longer
dance
mme
de
girardin
the
worshippers
at
althausen
were
much
surprised
the
next
day
to
see
a
priest
whom
they
did
not
know
officiating
without
ceremony
in
the
place
of
their
curé
he
was
stout
and
plain
with
an
inflamed
face
bloated
lips
a
cynical
look
and
a
thundering
voice
he
said
mass
in
such
a
hasty
and
indecorous
manner
that
they
went
away
scandalized
the
handsome
marcel
certainly
was
no
longer
there
with
his
sweet
and
unctuous
voice
his
evangelic
piety
and
his
eyes
which
stirred
their
hearts
the
report
spread
through
the
village
that
the
handsome
curé
had
gone
away
and
all
the
gossips
at
bay
grouped
in
the
and
watched
for
veronica
to
assail
her
with
questions
but
the
old
to
her
mortification
knew
no
more
about
it
than
the
gossips
she
ventured
to
interrogate
her
new
master
but
he
slapped
her
on
the
back
and
sent
her
away
to
her
he
is
disgusting
this
old
fellow
she
said
for
my
part
i
am
not
going
to
remain
here
i
prefer
the
corporal
durand
had
just
sat
down
at
table
with
his
daughter
when
marianne
with
a
scared
air
looked
at
suzanne
in
a
mysterious
way
and
said
to
the
captain
do
you
know
monsieur
le
curé
has
gone
away
pleasant
journey
said
durand
there
is
a
new
curé
already
in
his
place
he
said
mass
this
morning
a
new
curé
cried
suzanne
then
he
has
gone
away
not
to
return
again
gone
away
without
hope
of
coming
back
said
the
captain
that
is
discouraging
it
surprises
you
then
little
girl
that
the
handsome
priest
has
disappeared
with
neither
drum
nor
trumpet
and
with
no
touching
farewells
to
his
flock
for
my
part
i
am
not
surprised
at
it
and
i
wager
that
he
has
committed
some
act
of
blackguardism
and
has
absconded
oh
father
he
has
not
absconded
marianne
said
quickly
he
went
away
on
friday
very
quietly
with
another
curé
let
him
go
to
the
devil
suzanne
had
difficulty
in
hiding
her
palor
and
her
distress
she
pretended
to
have
a
left
the
table
ran
to
her
room
and
burst
into
tears
why
this
decisive
departure
why
had
she
not
received
a
single
warning
from
marcel
no
doubt
he
had
done
it
for
the
best
but
that
best
was
incomprehensible
to
her
her
heart
was
broken
and
her
received
a
cruel
wound
soon
the
news
arrived
the
new
curé
announced
marcel
change
in
the
sermon
and
said
farewell
for
him
to
his
parishioners
everybody
was
in
consternation
he
might
have
announced
the
seven
plagues
of
egypt
for
her
part
marianne
received
a
mysterious
packet
which
was
intended
for
suzanne
the
priest
in
cautious
terms
informed
her
of
his
change
and
said
it
was
necessary
to
wait
wait
for
what
suzanne
waited
but
one
morning
she
awoke
full
of
dismay
she
had
felt
something
give
a
start
in
her
entrails
she
wrote
a
long
letter
to
marcel
and
marcel
answered
wait
wait
for
what
she
waited
again
xcv
the
curé
of
marie
the
white
ground
and
the
gloomy
sky
blended
their
heads
sepulchral
the
rough
north
winds
of
winter
breathed
to
the
heart
despair
camille
delthil
weeks
and
then
months
passed
away
one
rainy
winter
evening
a
young
woman
in
deep
mourning
with
her
face
covered
with
a
thick
veil
stopped
at
the
curé
of
marie
door
she
had
hesitated
for
a
long
time
several
times
she
had
passed
in
front
of
the
tall
gray
house
casting
a
furtive
glance
on
the
lofty
windows
slackening
her
walk
and
seeming
to
say
ought
i
to
go
in
yes
i
must
go
in
but
each
time
she
pursued
her
way
again
at
length
as
the
rain
kept
falling
ever
colder
as
night
came
on
she
controlled
herself
by
en
effort
slowly
retraced
her
step
and
rang
gently
the
door
was
opened
at
once
and
an
old
woman
with
a
face
the
colour
of
leather
invited
her
in
mysteriously
whom
shall
i
announce
she
do
not
announce
me
i
am
expected
the
old
woman
smiled
discreetly
and
showed
her
into
a
large
parlour
the
door
of
which
she
closed
upon
her
it
was
a
bare
wainscoted
room
gloomy
lighted
by
two
a
a
table
some
straw
chairs
a
few
rows
of
old
books
on
shelves
painted
black
composed
all
the
furniture
a
large
crucifix
of
wood
which
stretched
its
thin
arms
from
one
window
to
the
other
contributed
no
little
to
give
a
sorrowful
and
monastic
look
to
the
room
the
young
girl
approached
the
where
a
few
brands
were
burning
at
the
bottom
of
a
huge
grate
she
shivered
perhaps
more
from
emotion
than
from
cold
for
she
remained
there
thoughtful
forgetting
even
to
warm
her
feet
soaked
by
the
rain
a
door
opened
soon
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
marcel
entered
he
had
greatly
changed
during
these
few
months
his
eye
shot
forth
a
gloomy
fire
his
cheeks
were
hollow
and
numerous
threads
of
silver
showed
themselves
in
his
dark
locks
it
was
evident
that
anxiety
watchings
and
cares
contended
on
his
wrinkled
brow
at
the
sight
of
the
young
woman
he
assumed
a
livid
palor
you
he
murmured
in
a
stifled
voice
you
here
mademoiselle
i
am
replied
suzanne
did
you
not
reckon
then
on
seeing
me
again
not
now
dear
child
i
confess
to
you
i
had
said
to
you
wait
and
i
have
waited
and
weary
of
waiting
i
decided
to
come
and
to
know
finally
from
your
own
mouth
what
i
must
wait
for
and
on
what
i
most
count
but
sir
i
am
tired
will
you
allow
me
to
sit
down
pardon
me
mademoiselle
i
mean
to
say
dear
suzanne
but
your
coming
has
filled
me
with
such
confusion
he
handed
her
a
chair
and
sat
down
facing
her
ah
dear
child
you
do
not
know
with
what
cares
i
am
overwhelmed
they
must
indeed
be
very
serious
sir
since
they
have
made
you
forgetful
of
your
duties
even
to
the
care
of
your
honour
and
of
mine
for
the
moment
is
approaching
when
i
shall
no
longer
he
able
to
hide
the
consequences
of
your
of
our
fault
dear
suzanne
of
both
our
faults
do
not
overwhelm
me
alone
for
it
was
your
pretty
face
which
made
me
mad
but
is
it
really
possible
can
it
be
true
what
you
are
i
have
let
you
know
it
sir
a
long
time
ago
and
you
have
not
deigned
to
give
any
answer
on
that
subject
i
have
read
and
read
again
your
letters
many
times
seeking
for
a
word
which
might
console
me
for
a
hope
for
a
light
but
there
was
nothing
you
have
told
me
to
wait
you
have
tried
like
a
coward
to
gain
time
you
have
reckoned
on
something
unforeseen
occurring
which
might
settle
the
question
without
your
aid
and
you
would
have
washed
your
hands
of
it
in
peace
in
your
broad
conscience
but
the
time
has
gone
on
the
unexpected
has
not
come
and
now
here
i
am
and
i
come
to
ask
you
what
do
you
intend
to
do
with
me
in
truth
dear
suzanne
i
had
not
believed
ah
you
are
more
beautiful
than
ever
no
i
had
not
believed
that
the
case
was
so
desperate
you
have
not
believed
no
doubt
amidst
your
life
of
lies
surrounded
by
hypocrites
and
criminals
you
have
included
me
charitably
in
the
number
and
supposed
that
i
lied
suzanne
dear
suzanne
do
not
be
offended
i
believed
that
you
wished
to
terrify
me
ah
how
lovely
you
are
like
this
ah
it
is
a
terrible
misfortune
we
must
guard
against
it
and
your
father
does
he
suspect
not
yet
sir
but
the
moment
is
approaching
when
i
shall
no
longer
be
able
to
hide
the
truth
it
is
true
then
what
is
to
be
done
what
is
to
be
done
stop
you
would
make
me
laugh
if
i
did
not
pity
you
i
am
come
to
ask
you
for
the
last
time
if
i
ought
to
count
upon
you
count
upon
me
but
my
dear
child
upon
whom
would
you
count
if
not
upon
me
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
you
have
only
me
to
count
on
i
am
your
friend
your
only
friend
always
the
same
dear
suzanne
i
am
ready
for
anything
in
order
to
get
you
out
of
this
scrape
but
judge
yourself
i
am
observed
by
all
here
the
slightest
report
would
terribly
and
would
ruin
me
i
am
surrounded
by
those
who
envy
me
and
consequently
are
my
enemies
in
a
year
or
two
perhaps
i
may
be
you
see
how
careful
i
have
to
be
of
my
position
i
will
do
everything
be
well
assured
of
it
it
is
my
interest
as
well
as
yours
but
i
can
not
do
the
impossible
what
do
you
ask
you
have
a
short
memory
sir
but
i
remember
i
remember
with
what
infernal
art
you
induced
me
not
to
yield
to
you
for
you
well
know
and
god
is
witness
to
it
that
i
yielded
only
to
violence
but
to
listen
to
you
with
a
too
trustful
ear
no
i
see
you
do
not
remember
it
you
have
forgotten
so
many
things
that
it
would
be
lost
time
to
try
and
refresh
your
memory
you
do
not
answer
for
in
truth
sir
the
parts
are
strangely
altered
and
if
i
am
ashamed
of
it
for
myself
i
blush
still
more
for
your
sake
but
since
you
are
so
careful
of
your
future
and
of
your
fortune
i
am
come
to
tell
you
this
i
am
rich
sir
do
not
then
fear
anything
do
not
dread
poverty
i
have
inherited
from
an
aunt
who
leaves
me
enough
to
provide
me
with
a
husband
but
what
i
want
is
a
father
for
my
child
mademoiselle
dear
and
suzanne
yes
ever
suzanne
i
am
full
of
confusion
and
remorse
i
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
for
your
generous
offer
but
can
i
accept
it
i
make
you
the
judge
of
it
yourself
do
i
belong
to
myself
i
am
the
church
bound
from
head
to
foot
body
and
soul
not
a
thought
belongs
to
myself
i
am
but
the
infinitesimal
portion
of
an
immense
wheel
which
carries
me
away
in
spite
of
myself
how
can
i
loosen
myself
from
the
gear
can
i
do
it
can
i
defy
such
a
scandal
my
honour
my
dignity
as
a
man
ah
you
are
appealing
to
your
honour
now
but
sir
your
duty
is
not
that
your
honour
and
what
is
your
duty
stay
you
are
a
wretch
as
she
uttered
these
words
a
young
girl
head
fair
charming
rosy
looked
inquisitively
through
the
door
suzanne
saw
it
and
grew
pale
her
brows
contracted
and
a
bitter
smile
passed
across
her
lips
i
understand
she
said
i
understand
your
hesitation
your
honour
and
your
scruples
farewell
sir
and
she
went
out
without
turning
her
head
stifling
her
sobs
marcel
followed
her
with
his
eyes
and
ran
to
the
door
suzanne
mademoiselle
you
shall
have
an
answer
another
word
she
made
no
reply
and
he
heard
the
close
a
tear
rolled
to
the
edge
of
his
eyelid
he
rushed
to
the
window
to
call
her
back
but
a
hand
laid
hold
of
his
and
the
fair
girl
stood
before
him
well
monsieur
my
uncle
well
and
who
is
that
handsome
dark
girl
ah
my
poor
zulma
do
not
be
jealous
of
her
i
am
jealous
of
everything
and
i
want
to
know

let
none
despair
comrades
good
night
byron
the
following
evening
the
canal
on
the
malzeville
road
discerned
a
black
shadow
which
despite
the
icy
rain
remained
for
a
long
time
leaning
on
the
parapet
of
the
then
all
at
once
disappeared
he
called
for
help
and
a
few
minutes
afterwards
they
drew
out
of
the
water
the
body
of
a
young
girl
of
remarkable
beauty
a
portion
of
a
letter
was
found
upon
her
which
at
first
aroused
a
thousand
comments
this
is
what
was
written
i
have
just
celebrated
the
holy
sacrifice
of
the
mass
and
during
the
elevation
i
prayed
god
to
inspire
me
with
a
good
idea
i
likewise
asked
of
the
queen
of
angels
what
i
could
do
for
this
unfortunate
one
the
god
and
the
mother
chaste
and
pure
hearkened
to
me
let
my
sister
in
jesus
christ
whose
image
will
never
be
effaced
from
the
heart
of
her
spiritual
friend
go
and
knock
at
the
gate
of
the
convent
of
our
lady
of
the
seven
sorrows
in
the
parish
of
marie
there
the
cares
which
her
interesting
condition
demand
will
be
afforded
her
it
will
be
easy
to
explain
her
temporary
absence
and
in
case
of
need
to
obtain
the
permission
of
a
parent
who
wished
to
place
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
this
pious
necessity
divine
providence
will
assist
in
this
as
it
assists
all
those
who
have
recourse
to
it
the
ladies
of
the
seven
sorrows
are
informed
and
they
await
the
new
sheep
with
mothers
and
sisters
hearts
let
it
be
thus
done
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
jesus
mary
joseph
on
applying
at
the
convent
of
the
seven
sorrows
the
good
sisters
said
that
in
fact
they
had
received
a
letter
sealed
with
the
episcopal
arms
announcing
the
arrival
of
a
young
lady
they
were
unable
to
say
more
monseigneur
when
questioned
summoned
the
abbé
marcel
who
gave
the
examining
magistrate
the
most
satisfactory
explanations
acknowledging
that
he
was
the
author
of
the
letter
and
that
she
was
a
young
girl
whose
honour
he
desired
to
save
this
event
did
the
greatest
good
to
the
reputation
of
the
former
curé
of
althausen
his
discretion
his
wisdom
and
his
virtue
were
lauded
more
than
ever

the
author
and
his
works
hector
france
alighted
upon
this
planet
some
fifty
years
ago
and
chose
his
home
in
the
midst
of
a
family
renowned
for
generations
as
fighters
from
this
preliminary
statement
we
may
deduce
two
facts
firstly
that
baby
hector
was
not
destined
by
his
paternal
sire
for
any
other
than
the
martial
profession
and
secondly
that
the
squealing
youngster
of
those
days
is
now
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
upright
and
vigorous
hector
france
looks
every
inch
just
what
he
really
is
a
soldier
and
a
gentleman
as
ready
to
handle
the
sword
as
to
smite
lie
and
hypocrisy
with
the
pen
the
qualities
of
his
mind
are
faithfully
delineated
in
his
features
he
has
the
same
leonine
look
that
distinguished
the
famous
english
iconoclast
charles
bradlaugh
the
massive
brow
the
firm
determined
jaw
the
large
luminous
eyes
the
wavy
hair
and
big
shoulders
would
anywhere
mark
him
out
at
once
though
unknown
as
a
philosopher
fighter
orator
and
leader
of
men
the
career
of
the
two
men
also
offers
points
in
common
if
charles
bradlaugh
was
a
soldier
so
was
hector
france
with
the
difference
that
the
latter
really
did
face
and
whereas
his
english
prototype
early
bought
himself
out
of
the
service
both
men
too
mixed
in
the
game
of
politics
only
bradlaugh
luck
landed
him
at
last
in
parliament
while
france
led
a
forlorn
hope
that
ended
after
many
a
narrow
escape
for
life
in
twenty
years
of
weary
exile
from
his
beloved
country
finally
both
men
hold
nearly
identical
opinions
with
regard
to
religious
questions
only
bradlaugh
imagined
he
had
a
special
mission
to
assail
the
world
historic
faiths
and
hector
france
like
ernest
renan
smiles
in
a
curious
oriental
way
when
these
things
are
broached
quite
content
for
you
to
believe
anything
you
please
so
that
you
do
not
bother
him
overmuch
with
your
reasons
hector
france
must
not
be
confounded
as
is
often
done
by
ignorant
persons
with
the
gentleman
who
has
elected
to
call
himself
anatole
france
and
who
writes
under
that
name
the
real
patronym
of
anatole
france
is
i
am
informed
monsieur
chaussepied
which
interpreted
into
english
means
it
is
unnecessary
to
state
that
hector
france
is
content
with
his
own
name
and
would
not
have
changed
it
even
had
it
been
less
noble
than
it
really
is
believing
with
us
that
a
man
work
are
sufficient
title
to
nobility
however
odd
may
be
the
cognomen
bequeathed
him
from
bygone
sires
the
appearance
of
this
book
in
english
will
prove
a
godsend
to
protestants
who
may
see
in
it
only
an
attack
on
catholicism
let
them
hug
no
such
flattering
unction
to
their
souls
hector
france
is
no
savage
iconoclast
gone
mad
with
sectarian
hatred
he
recognizes
the
good
in
all
religions
as
answering
a
temporary
need
in
the
evolution
of
humanity
and
for
none
has
he
a
more
profound
respect
than
the
catholic
church
indeed
the
pomp
and
magnificence
the
architectural
grandeur
the
vast
learning
wealth
and
influence
of
this
institution
appeal
to
the
imagination
of
both
ignorant
and
cultured
alike
the
aim
of
the
distinguished
writer
of
the
grip
of
desire
is
far
removed
from
that
of
vulgar
and
gratuitous
he
seeks
to
show
the
danger
to
human
character
that
comes
through
meddling
with
one
of
the
most
imperious
of
natural
instincts
if
in
the
chastisement
of
mansour
he
bodies
forth
the
consequences
of
unbridled
libertinism
in
the
grip
of
desire
he
demonstrates
the
evils
attendant
on
a
life
of
forced
celibacy
in
the
first
we
have
the
autocratic
reign
of
the
flesh
in
the
second
the
subjection
of
legitimate
carnal
desire
the
union
of
the
female
to
the
male
is
a
law
of
nature
as
solid
as
the
granite
bases
of
the
world
no
normally
constituted
man
can
disregard
that
law
without
doing
violence
to
himself
and
to
his
kind
kant

man
and
woman
constitute
when
united

whole
and
entire

completes
the
other
schopenhauer
asserts
the
sexual
impulse
is
the
most
complete
expression
of
the
will
to
live
in
other
words
it
is
the
concentration
of
all
volition
and
in
another
passage
the
affirmation
of
the
will
to
live
concentrates
itself
in
the
act
of
procreation
which
is
its
most
positive
expression
mainländer
gives
utterance
to
the
opinion
when
he
says
the
sexual
impulse
is
the
centre
of
gravity
for
human
existence
it
alone
secures
to
the
individual
the
life
which
he
above
all
desires
man
devotes
himself
more
seriously
to
the
business
of
procreation
than
to
any
other
in
the
achievement
of
nothing
else
does
he
condense
and
concentrate
the
intensity
of
his
will
in
so
remarkable
a
manner
as
in
the
act
of
generation
and
before
all
those
buddha
wrote
sexual
desire
is
sharper
than
the
hook
with
which
wild
elephants
are
tamed
hotter
than
flame
it
is
like
an
arrow
that
is
shot
into
the
heart
of
man
the
present
work
if
it
teach
anything
at
all
teaches
that
celibacy
is
a
crime
and
the
mother
of
crime
just
as
a
venomous
plant
is
a
producer
of
poison
the
needs
of
his
organization
torment
the
single
man
until
he
robs
from
others
that
which
he
lacks
hence
seduction
rape
adultery
the
invasion
of
trouble
into
families
and
furious
jealousies
with
all
their
prolific
brood
of
and
woe
this
is
not
the
place
to
praise
or
to
blame
the
book
before
us
each
man
will
judge
it
according
to
his
individual
tastes
temperament
and
character
the
embryonic
man
may
consider
it
bold
far
too
outspoken
the
reader
more
conversant
with
the
realities
of
life
will
be
inclined
to
look
upon
it
with
larger
charity
having
regard
to
what
the
author
has
from
rather
than
to
what
he
has
said
at
the
outset
says
camille
lemonnier
himself
a
writer
these
pages
are
conspicuously
chaste
temptation
takes
the
form
of
mystical
sensuality
at
first
beaten
back
and
then
surging
forwards
victorious
then
as
the
fire
of
passion
grows
more
intense
the
lamp
of
the
tabernacle
dies
gradually
out
and
humanity
with
the
unchaining
of
instinct
breaks
forth
cries
and
howls
like
a
mad
gorilla
from
his
cage
here
again
we
witness
the
triumph
of
eve
entangled
in
her
long
flaxen
tresses
she
sweeps
away
the
sinner
conscience
and
while
the
church
closes
the
door
against
them
both
nature
opens
out
wide
her
own
with
a
kindly
come
