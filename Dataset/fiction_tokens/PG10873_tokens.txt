jack
nugent
first
idea
on
seeing
a
letter
from
his
father
asking
him
to
meet
him
at
samson
wilks
was
to
send
as
impolite
a
refusal
as
a
strong
sense
of
undutifulness
and
a
not
inapt
pen
could
arrange
but
the
united
remonstrances
of
the
kybird
family
made
him
waver
you
go
said
kybird
solemnly
take
the
advice
of
a
man
wot
seen
life
and
go
who
knows
but
wot
he
a
thinking
of
doing
something
for
you
startin
of
you
in
business
or
somethin
said
kybird
but
if
tries
to
break
it
off
between
you
and
i
hope
you
know
what
to
say
he
wo
do
that
said
her
husband
if
he
wants
to
see
me
said
nugent
let
him
come
here
i
would
in
my
house
retorted
kybird
quickly
an
englishman
is
his
castle
and
i
wo
him
in
mine
why
not
asked
his
wife
if
the
two
families
is
to
be
connected
kybird
shook
his
head
and
catching
her
eye
winked
at
her
with
much
significance
it
your
own
way
said
kybird
who
was
always
inclined
to
make
concessions
in
minor
matters
it
your
own
way
but
do
blame
me
that
all
i
ask
urged
on
by
his
friends
nugent
at
last
consented
and
in
a
reply
to
his
father
agreed
to
meet
him
at
the
house
of
wilks
on
thursday
evening
he
was
not
free
from
a
slight
curiosity
as
to
the
reasons
which
had
made
the
captain
unbend
in
so
unusual
a
fashion
nathan
smith
put
in
an
appearance
at
six
on
the
fatal
evening
he
was
a
short
slight
man
with
a
face
mapped
with
tiny
wrinkles
and
a
pair
of
colourless
eyes
the
blankness
of
whose
expression
defied
research
in
conversation
especially
conversation
of
a
diplomatic
nature
smith
seemed
to
be
looking
through
his
opponent
at
something
beyond
an
uncomfortable
habit
which
was
a
source
of
much
discomfort
to
his
victims
here
we
are
then
wilks
he
said
putting
his
head
in
the
door
and
smiling
at
the
agitated
steward
come
in
said
wilks
shortly
smith
obliged
nice
night
outside
he
said
taking
a
chair
clear
wot
a
morning
it
be
for
a
sail
if
we
was
only
young
enough
is
that
terbacker
in
that
canister
there
the
other
pushed
it
towards
him
if
i
was
only
young
enough
and
silly
enough
said
the
master
producing
a
pipe
with
an
unusually
large
bowl
and
slowly
filling
it
there
nothing
i
should
enjoy
more
than
a
three
years
cruise
nothing
to
do
and
everything
of
the
best
you
made
all
the
arrangements
inquired
wilks
in
a
tone
of
cold
superiority
smith
glanced
affectionately
at
a
of
bulky
appearance
which
stood
on
the
floor
between
his
feet
all
ready
he
said
cheerfully
an
if
you
like
a
yourself
i
can
manage
it
for
you
in
two
twos
you
got
to
say
the
word

do
want

said
the
steward
fiercely
do
you
try
none
your
larks
on
me
nathan
smith

pounds

retorted
wilks
who
by
no
means
relished
these
remarks
if
i
was
getting
as
much
out
of
it
as
you
are
i
be
a
man
sighed
smith
me
cried
the
other

this
why

i
sooner
wot

i
tapping
it
demanded
smith
in
surprise
well

i
glad

me

quite
welcome
said
the
steward
sharply
crimping
ai
in
my
line
i
sooner
sweep
the
roads
exclaimed
smith
approvingly
ah
wot
a
thing
it
is
to
come
acrost
an
honest
man
wot
a
good
thing
it
is
for
the
eyesight
he
stared
stonily
somewhere
in
the
direction
of
wilks
and
then
blinking
rapidly
shielded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
as
though
overcome
by
the
sight
of
so
much
goodness
the
steward
wrath
rose
at
the
performance
and
he
glowered
back
at
him
until
his
eyes
watered
twenty
past
six
said
smith
suddenly
as
he
fumbled
in
his
and
drew
out
a
small
folded
paper
it
time
i
made
a
start
i
you
got
some
salt
in
the
house

said
wilks
and
beer
inquired
the
other
yes

is
some
beer

the
steward
bring
me
a
quart
of
it
said
the
slowly
and
impressively
i
want

drawed
in
a
china
mug
with
a
nice
foaming
on
it
wot
do
you
want
it
for
inquired
wilks
eyeing
him
very
closely
bisness
purposes
said
smith
if
you
very
good
you
shall
see
i
do
it
still
the
steward
made
no
move
i
thought
you
brought
the
stuff
with
you
he
remarked
smith
looked
at
him
with
mild
reproach
are
you
managing
this
affair
or
am
i
he
inquired
the
steward
went
out
reluctantly
and
drawing
a
quart
mug
of
beer
set
it
down
on
the
table
and
stood
watching
his
visitor
and
now
i
want
a
spoonful
o
sugar
a
spoonful
o
salt
and
a
spoonful
o
vinegar
said
smith
make
haste
afore
the
goes
off
of
it
wilks
withdrew
grumbling
and
came
back
in
a
wonderfully
short
space
of
time
considering
with
the
articles
required
thankee
said
the
other
you
been
quick
i
wish
i
could
move
as
quick
as
you
do
but
you
can
take
back
now
i
find
i
can
do
without
where
the
beer
demanded
the
incensed
wilks
where
the
beer
you
underhanded
swab
i
altered
my
mind
said
smith
and
not
liking
waste
and
seeing
by
your
manner
that
you
more
than
enough
already
i
drunk
it
there
is
another
man
in
sunwich
i
could
ha
played
that
trick
on
no
nor
a
boy
neither
wilks
was
about
to
speak
but
thinking
better
of
it
threw
the
three
spoons
in
the
kitchen
and
resuming
his
seat
by
the
fire
sat
with
his
back
half
turned
to
his
visitor
bright
cheerful
young
chap
is
said
smith
you
knowed
ever
since
he
was
a
baby
have
you
wilks
made
no
reply
the
conqueror
sailing
morning
too
continued
his
tormentor
his
father
old
ship
strange
it
seem
to
following
it
out
aboard
a
whaler
life
is
full
o
surprises
wilks
and
wot
a
big
surprise
it
would
be
to
you
if
you
could
wot
he
says
about
you
when
he
comes
to
senses
i
obeying
orders
growled
the
other
quite
right
said
smith
approvingly
as
he
drew
a
bottle
of
whisky
from
his
bag
and
placed
it
on
the
table
two
glasses
and
there
we
are
we
do
want
any
salt
and
vinegar
this
time
wilks
turned
a
deaf
ear
but
are
you
going
to
manage
so
as
to
make
one
silly
and
not
the
other
he
inquired
it
a
trade
secret
said
the
other
but
i
do
mind
telling
you
i
sent
the
something
to
take
afore
he
comes
and
i
shall
be
in
your
kitchen
looking
arter
things
i
you
know
wot
you
about
said
wilks
doubtfully
i
so
rejoined
the
other
young
trusts
you
and
of
course
he
take
anything
from
your
that
the
beauty
of
a
character
wilks
a
good
character
and
a
face
like
a
baby
with
grey
whiskers
wilks
bent
down
and
taking
up
a
small
brush
carefully
tidied
up
the
hearth
like
as
not
if
my
part
in
it
gets
to
be
known
pursued
smith
mournfully
i
that
gal
of
kybird
scratching
my
eyes
out
or
sticking
a
into
me
i
had
that
once
the
longest
that
ever
was
made
i
should
think
he
shook
his
head
over
the
perils
of
his
calling
and
then
after
another
glance
at
the
clock
withdrew
to
the
kitchen
with
his
bag
leaving
wilks
waiting
in
a
state
of
intense
nervousness
for
the
arrival
of
the
others
captain
nugent
was
the
first
to
put
in
an
appearance
and
by
way
of
setting
a
good
example
poured
a
little
of
the
whisky
in
his
glass
and
sat
there
waiting
then
jack
nugent
came
in
fresh
and
glowing
and
wilks
after
standing
about
helplessly
for
a
few
moments
obeyed
the
captain
significant
nod
and
joined
smith
in
the
kitchen
you
better
go
for
a
walk
said
that
regarding
him
kindly
that
wot
the
thought
wilks
acquiesced
eagerly
and
tapping
at
the
door
passed
through
the
room
again
into
the
street
a
glance
as
he
went
through
showed
him
that
jack
nugent
was
drinking
and
he
set
off
in
a
panic
to
get
away
from
the
scene
which
he
had
contrived
he
slackened
after
a
time
and
began
to
pace
the
streets
at
a
rate
which
was
less
noticeable
as
he
passed
the
kybirds
he
shivered
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
consumed
a
pint
or
two
of
the
strongest
brew
procurable
at
the
that
he
began
to
regain
some
of
his
old
he
felt
almost
maudlin
at
the
sacrifice
of
character
he
was
enduring
for
the
sake
of
his
old
master
and
the
fact
that
he
could
not
narrate
it
to
sympathetic
friends
was
not
the
least
of
his
troubles
illustration
it
was
not
until
he
had
consumed
a
pint
or
two
of
the
strongest
brew
that
he
began
to
regain
some
of
his
old
the
shops
had
closed
by
the
time
he
got
into
the
street
again
and
he
walked
down
and
watched
with
much
solemnity
the
reflection
of
the
quay
lamps
in
the
dark
water
of
the
harbour
the
air
was
keen
and
the
various
craft
distinct
in
the
starlight
perfect
quiet
reigned
aboard
the
seabird
and
after
a
vain
attempt
to
screw
up
his
courage
to
see
the
victim
taken
aboard
he
gave
it
up
and
walked
back
along
the
beach
by
the
time
he
turned
his
steps
homewards
it
was
nearly
eleven
fullalove
alley
was
quiet
and
after
listening
for
some
time
at
his
window
he
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
and
passed
in
the
nearly
empty
bottle
stood
on
the
table
and
an
tumbler
accounted
for
a
large
dark
patch
on
the
as
he
entered
the
room
the
kitchen
door
opened
and
nathan
smith
with
a
broad
smile
on
his
face
stepped
briskly
in
all
over
he
said
rubbing
his
hands
he
went
off
like
a
lamb
no
trouble
nor
fighting
he
was
a
example
to
all
of
us
did
the
see
aboard
inquired
wilks
certainly
not
said
the
other
as
a
matter
o
fact
the
took
a
little
more
than
i
told
to
take
and
i
to
help
up
to
your
bed
accidents
will
but
he
be
all
right
in
the
morning
if
nobody
goes
near
leave
perfectly
quiet
and
when
comes
downstairs
give
a
strong
cup
o
tea
in
my
bed
repeated
the
staring
wilks
he
as
right
as
rain
said
the
boarding
master
i
brought
down
a
pillow
and
blankets
for
you
and
put
in
the
kitchen
and
now
take
the
other
two
pound
ten
and
be
getting
off
it
ought
to
be
ten
pounds
really
with
the
trouble
i
wilks
laid
the
desired
amount
on
the
table
and
nathan
smith
placing
it
in
his
pocket
rose
to
go
do
disturb
till
he
sleep
out
mind
he
said
pausing
at
the
door
else
i
ca
answer
for
the
consequences
if
should
get
up
in
the
night
and
come
down
raving
mad
try
and
soothe
and
pleasant
dreams
he
closed
the
door
after
him
quietly
and
the
horrified
steward
after
fetching
the
on
tiptoe
from
the
kitchen
locked
the
door
which
led
to
the
staircase
and
after
making
up
a
bed
on
the
floor
lay
down
in
his
clothes
and
tried
to
get
to
sleep
he
dozed
off
at
last
but
woke
up
several
times
during
the
night
with
the
cold
the
lamp
burnt
itself
out
and
in
the
dark
he
listened
intently
for
any
sounds
of
life
in
the
room
above
then
he
fell
asleep
again
until
at
about
seven
in
the
morning
a
loud
crash
overhead
awoke
him
with
a
start
in
a
moment
he
was
sitting
up
with
every
faculty
on
the
alert
footsteps
blundered
about
in
the
room
above
and
a
large
and
rapidly
widening
patch
of
damp
showed
on
the
ceiling
it
was
evident
that
the
sleeper
in
his
haste
to
quench
an
abnormal
thirst
had
broken
the
water
jug
wilks
shivering
with
dread
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stood
irresolute
judging
by
the
noise
the
captain
was
evidently
in
a
fine
temper
and
smith
remarks
about
insanity
occurred
to
him
with
redoubled
interest
then
he
heard
a
hoarse
shout
the
latch
of
the
bedroom
door
clicked
and
the
prisoner
stumbled
heavily
downstairs
and
began
to
fumble
at
the
handle
of
the
door
at
the
bottom
trembling
with
excitement
wilks
dashed
forward
and
turned
the
key
and
then
retreating
to
the
street
door
prepared
for
instant
flight
he
opened
the
door
so
suddenly
that
the
man
on
the
other
side
with
a
sudden
cry
fell
on
all
fours
into
the
room
and
raising
his
face
stared
stupidly
at
the
steward
wilks
hands
dropped
to
his
sides
and
his
tongue
refused
its
office
for
in
some
strange
fashion
quite
in
keeping
with
the
lawless
proceedings
of
the
previous
night
captain
nugent
had
changed
into
a
most
excellent
likeness
of
his
own
son
illustration
the
man
on
the
other
side
fell
on
all
fours
into
the
room
chapter
xii
for
some
time
wilks
stood
gazing
at
this
unexpected
apparition
and
trying
to
collect
his
scattered
senses
its
face
was
pale
and
flabby
while
its
glassy
eyes
set
in
rims
of
red
eyelids
were
beginning
to
express
unmistakable
signs
of
suspicion
and
wrath
the
shock
was
so
sudden
that
the
steward
could
not
even
think
coherently
was
the
captain
upstairs
and
if
so
what
was
his
condition
where
was
nathan
smith
and
where
was
the
five
pounds
a
voice
a
husky
and
discordant
voice
broke
in
upon
his
meditations
jack
nugent
was
also
curious
what
does
all
this
mean
he
demanded
angrily
how
did
i
get
here
you
you
came
downstairs
stammered
wilks
still
racking
his
brains
in
the
vain
effort
to
discover
how
matters
stood
nugent
was
about
to
speak
but
thinking
better
of
it
turned
and
blundered
into
the
kitchen
sounds
of
splashing
and
puffing
ensued
and
the
steward
going
to
the
door
saw
him
with
his
head
under
the
tap
he
followed
him
in
and
at
the
right
time
handed
him
a
towel
despite
the
disordered
appearance
of
his
hair
the
improvement
in
condition
was
so
manifest
that
the
steward
hoping
for
similar
results
turned
the
tap
on
again
and
followed
his
example
your
head
wants
cooling
i
should
think
said
the
young
man
returning
him
the
towel
what
it
all
about
wilks
hesitated
a
bright
thought
occurred
to
him
and
murmuring
something
about
a
dry
towel
he
sped
up
the
narrow
stairs
to
his
bedroom
the
captain
was
not
there
he
pushed
open
the
small
lattice
window
and
peered
out
into
the
alley
no
sign
of
either
the
captain
or
the
ingenious
nathan
smith
with
a
heavy
heart
he
descended
the
stairs
again
illustration
he
pushed
open
the
small
lattice
window
and
peered
out
into
the
alley
now
said
nugent
who
was
sitting
down
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
perhaps
you
be
good
enough
to
explain
what
all
this
means
you
were
last
night
said
wilks
you
and
the
i
know
that
said
nugent
how
is
it
i
did
go
home
i
understand
that
it
was
an
invitation
where
is
my
father
the
steward
shook
his
head
helplessly
he
was
when
i
went
out
last
night
he
said
slowly
when
i
came
back
the
room
was
empty
and
i
was
told
as
was
upstairs
in
my
bed
told
he
was
in
your
bed
repeated
the
other
who
told
you
he
pushed
open
the
small
lattice
window
and
peered
out
into
the
alley
wilks
caught
his
breath
i
mean
i
told
myself
was
in
my
bed
he
stammered
because
when
i
came
in
i
see
these
on
the
floor
an
i
thought
as
the
put
them
there
for
me
and
taken
my
bed
nugent
regarded
the
litter
of
as
though
hoping
that
they
would
throw
a
little
light
on
the
affair
and
then
shot
a
puzzled
glance
at
wilks
why
should
you
think
my
father
wanted
your
bed
he
inquired
i
do
know
was
the
reply
i
thought
maybe
taken
a
little
more
than
ought
to
have
taken
but
it
all
a
to
me
i
more
astonished
than
wot
you
are
well
i
ca
make
head
or
tail
of
it
said
nugent
rising
and
pacing
the
room
i
came
here
to
meet
my
father
so
far
as
i
remember
i
had
one
drink
of
whisky
your
whisky
and
then
i
woke
up
in
your
bedroom
with
a
splitting
headache
and
a
tongue
like
a
piece
of
leather
can
you
account
for
it
wilks
shook
his
head
again
i
was
here
he
said
plucking
up
courage
why
not
go
an
see
your
father
seems
to
me
is
the
one
that
would
know
most
about
it
nugent
stood
for
a
minute
considering
and
then
raising
the
latch
of
the
door
opened
it
slowly
and
inhaled
the
cold
morning
air
a
subtle
and
delicate
aroma
of
coffee
and
herrings
which
had
escaped
from
neighbouring
invaded
the
room
and
reminded
him
of
an
appetite
he
turned
to
go
but
had
barely
quitted
the
step
before
he
saw
kingdom
and
his
sister
enter
the
alley
wilks
saw
them
too
and
turning
if
anything
a
shade
paler
supported
himself
by
the
kate
nugent
quickened
her
pace
as
she
saw
them
and
after
a
surprised
greeting
to
her
brother
breathlessly
informed
him
that
the
captain
was
missing
has
been
home
all
night
panted
kingdom
joining
them
i
do
know
what
to
think
they
formed
an
excited
little
group
round
the
steward
door
and
wilks
with
an
instinctive
feeling
that
the
matter
was
one
to
be
discussed
in
private
led
the
way
indoors
he
began
to
apologize
for
the
disordered
condition
of
the
room
but
jack
nugent
interrupting
him
brusquely
began
to
relate
his
own
adventures
of
the
past
few
hours
kingdom
listened
to
the
narrative
with
unexpected
calmness
she
knew
the
cause
of
her
nephew
discomfiture
it
was
the
glass
of
whisky
acting
on
a
system
unaccustomed
to
alcohol
and
she
gave
a
vivid
and
moving
account
of
the
effects
of
a
stiff
glass
of
hot
rum
which
she
had
once
taken
for
a
cold
it
was
quite
clear
to
her
that
the
captain
had
put
his
son
to
bed
the
thing
to
discover
now
was
where
he
had
put
himself
sam
knows
something
about
it
said
her
nephew
darkly
something
wrong
i
know
no
more
than
a
babe
unborn
declared
wilks
the
last
i
see
of
the
was
at
this
table
opposite
you
sam
would
hurt
a
fly
said
miss
nugent
with
a
kind
glance
at
her
favourite
well
where
is
the
governor
then
inquired
her
brother
why
he
go
home
last
night
he
has
never
stayed
out
before
yes
he
has
said
kingdom
folding
her
hands
in
her
lap
when
you
were
children
he
came
home
at
eleven
next
morning
and
when
i
asked
him
where
he
been
he
nearly
bit
my
head
off
i
been
walking
the
floor
all
night
and
i
shall
never
forget
his
remarks
when
he
opened
the
door
to
the
police
who
come
to
say
they
could
find
him
never
a
ghostly
grin
flitted
across
the
features
of
wilks
but
he
passed
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
mouth
and
became
serious
again
as
he
thought
of
his
position
he
was
almost
dancing
with
anxiety
to
get
away
to
nathan
smith
and
ask
for
an
explanation
of
the
proceedings
of
the
night
before
i
go
and
have
a
look
round
for
the
he
said
eagerly
he
ca
be
far
i
come
with
you
said
nugent
i
should
like
to
see
him
too
there
are
one
or
two
little
things
that
want
explaining
you
take
aunt
home
kate
and
i
follow
on
as
soon
as
there
is
any
news
as
he
spoke
the
door
opened
a
little
way
and
a
head
appeared
only
to
be
instantly
withdrawn
at
the
sight
of
so
many
people
wilks
stepped
forward
hastily
and
throwing
the
door
wide
open
revealed
the
interesting
features
of
nathan
smith
how
do
you
do
mr
wilks
said
that
gentleman
softly
i
just
walked
round
to
see
whether
you
was
in
i
got
a
message
for
you
i
know
you
got
company
he
stepped
into
the
room
and
tapping
the
steward
on
the
chest
with
a
confidential
finger
backed
him
into
a
corner
and
having
got
him
there
gave
an
expressive
wink
with
one
eye
and
gazed
into
space
with
the
other
illustration
tapping
the
steward
on
the
chest
with
a
confidential
finger
he
backed
him
into
a
corner
i
thought
you
be
alone
he
said
looking
round
but
just
as
well
as
it
is
they
got
to
know
so
they
may
as
well
know
now
as
later
on
know
what
inquired
jack
nugent
abruptly
what
are
you
making
that
face
for
sam
wilks
mumbled
something
about
a
decayed
tooth
and
to
give
colour
to
the
statement
continued
a
series
of
contortions
which
made
his
face
ache
you
should
take
something
for
that
tooth
said
the
with
great
solicitude
wot
do
you
say
to
a
glass
o
whisky
he
motioned
to
the
fatal
bottle
which
still
stood
on
the
table
the
steward
caught
his
breath
and
then
rising
to
the
occasion
said
that
he
had
already
had
a
couple
of
glasses
and
they
had
done
no
good
what
your
message
inquired
jack
nugent
impatiently
i
just
going
to
tell
you
said
smith
i
was
out
early
this
morning
strolling
down
by
the
harbour
to
get
a
little
appetite
for
breakfast
when
who
should
i
see
coming
along
looking
as
though
just
come
from
a
funeral
but
nugent
i
was
going
to
pass
but
he
stopped
me
and
asked
me
to
take
a
message
from
to
old
and
faithful
steward
mr
wilks
why
has
he
gone
away
exclaimed
kingdom
his
old
and
faithful
steward
repeated
smith
motioning
her
to
silence
he
says
i
am
heartily
ashamed
of
myself
for
wot
took
place
last
night
and
him
too
tell
that
after
my
father
proved
too
much
for
me
i
walked
the
streets
all
night
and
now
i
ca
face
may
injured
son
and
family
yet
awhile
and
i
off
to
london
till
it
has
blown
over
but
what
it
all
about
demanded
nugent
why
do
you
get
to
the
point
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
replied
smith
with
the
studious
care
of
one
who
desires
to
give
exact
information
nugent
and
wilks
a
little
plan
for
giving
you
a
sea
blow
me
interrupted
the
unfortunate
steward
now
look
nathan
smith
them
was
the
words
said
the
giving
him
a
glance
of
great
significance
are
you
going
to
take
away
or
add
to
wot
the
says
wilks
collapsed
and
avoiding
the
indignant
eyes
of
the
nugent
family
tried
to
think
out
his
position
it
seems
from
wot
the
told
me
continued
smith
that
there
was
some
objection
to
your
marrying
old
kybird
gal
so
and
wilks
after
putting
their
together
decided
to
get
you
and
after
giving
you
a
little
whisky
that
wilks
knows
the
trick
of
me
interrupted
the
unfortunate
steward
again
them
was
the
words
said
smith
coldly
after
you
it
they
was
going
to
stow
you
away
in
the
seabird
which
sailed
this
morning
however
when
the
see
you
overcome
his
melted
and
instead
o
putting
you
aboard
the
whaler
he
took
your
feet
and
wilks
your
and
after
a
great
deal
o
trouble
got
you
upstairs
and
put
you
to
bed
you
miserable
scoundrel
said
the
astonished
nugent
addressing
the
shrinking
steward
you
infernal
old
reprobate
you
you
i
did
think
you
got
it
in
you
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
said
smith
kindly
wilks
was
only
obeying
orders
it
was
the
plan
and
wilks
was
aboard
ship
with
for
a
very
long
time
o
course
he
ought
to
ha
done
it
but
the
a
masterful
man
an
i
can
quite
understand
wilks
givin
way
i
dessay
i
should
myself
if
i
been
in
place
he
all
is
wilks
no
it
a
good
job
for
you
you
an
old
man
sam
said
nugent
i
can
hardly
believe
it
of
you
sam
said
miss
nugent
i
can
hardly
think
you
could
have
been
so
deceitful
why
we
trusted
you
all
our
lives
the
unfortunate
steward
quailed
beneath
the
severity
of
her
glance
even
if
he
gave
a
full
account
of
the
affair
it
would
not
make
his
position
better
it
was
he
who
had
made
all
the
arrangements
with
smith
and
after
an
indignant
glance
at
that
gentleman
he
lowered
his
gaze
and
remained
silent
it
is
rather
odd
that
my
father
should
take
you
into
his
confidence
said
miss
nugent
turning
to
the
just
wot
i
thought
miss
said
the
complaisant
smith
but
i
there
was
nobody
else
and
he
wanted
message
to
go
for
fear
you
should
get
worrying
the
police
about
or
something
he
wants
it
quiet
and
last
words
to
me
as
left
me
was
this
affair
gets
known
i
shall
never
come
back
tell
to
keep
it
quiet
i
do
think
anybody
will
want
to
go
bragging
about
it
said
jack
nugent
rising
unless
it
is
sam
wilks
come
along
kate
miss
nugent
followed
him
obediently
only
pausing
at
the
door
to
give
a
last
glance
of
mingled
surprise
and
reproach
at
wilks
then
they
were
outside
and
the
door
closed
behind
them
well
that
all
right
said
smith
easily
all
right
vociferated
the
steward
wot
did
you
put
it
all
on
to
me
for
why
did
you
tell
your
part
in
it
would
ha
done
any
good
said
smith
would
ha
done
you
any
good
besides
i
did
just
wot
the
told
me
when
he
coming
back
inquired
the
steward
smith
shook
his
head
could
say
he
returned
he
could
say
between
you
an
me
i
expect
gone
up
to
have
a
fair
spree
why
did
you
tell
me
last
night
he
was
inquired
the
other
orders
repeated
smith
with
relish
ask
not
me
as
a
matter
o
fact
he
spent
the
night
at
my
place
and
went
off
this
morning
an
wot
about
the
five
pounds
inquired
wilks
spitefully
you
ai
earned
it
i
know
i
ai
said
smith
mournfully
that
wot
worrying
me
it
like
a
gnawing
pain
in
my
side
think
it
conscience
biting
of
me
i
never
felt
it
before
or
d
think
it
sorrow
to
think
that
i
done
the
whole
job
too
cheap
you
think
it
out
and
let
me
know
later
on
so
long
he
waved
his
hand
cheerily
to
the
steward
and
departed
wilks
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
ignoring
the
cold
and
the
general
air
of
desolation
of
his
best
room
gave
way
to
a
fit
of
melancholy
which
would
have
made
edward
silk
green
with
envy
chapter
xiii
days
passed
but
no
word
came
from
the
missing
captain
and
only
the
determined
opposition
of
kate
nugent
kept
her
aunt
from
advertising
in
the
agony
columns
of
the
london
press
miss
nugent
was
quite
as
desirous
of
secrecy
in
the
affair
as
her
father
and
it
was
a
source
of
great
annoyance
to
her
when
in
some
mysterious
manner
it
leaked
out
in
a
very
short
time
the
news
was
common
property
and
wilks
appearing
to
his
neighbours
in
an
entirely
new
character
was
besieged
for
information
his
own
friends
were
the
most
tiresome
their
open
admiration
of
his
lawlessness
and
their
readiness
to
trace
other
mysterious
disappearances
to
his
agency
being
particularly
galling
to
a
man
whose
respectability
formed
his
most
cherished
possession
other
people
regarded
the
affair
as
a
joke
and
he
sat
gazing
one
evening
at
the
two
schooners
at
the
insensible
figures
of
three
men
who
had
each
had
a
modest
at
his
expense
it
was
a
pretty
conceit
and
well
played
but
the
steward
owing
to
the
frenzied
efforts
of
one
of
the
sleeper
whom
he
had
awakened
with
a
quart
pot
did
not
stay
to
admire
it
he
finished
up
the
evening
at
the
chequers
and
after
getting
wet
through
on
the
way
home
fell
asleep
in
his
wet
clothes
before
the
dying
fire
illustration
he
finished
up
the
evening
at
the
chequers
he
awoke
with
a
bad
cold
and
pains
in
the
limbs
a
headache
was
not
unexpected
but
the
other
symptoms
were
with
trembling
hands
he
managed
to
light
a
fire
and
prepare
a
breakfast
which
he
left
untouched
this
last
symptom
was
the
most
alarming
of
all
and
going
to
the
door
he
bribed
a
small
boy
with
a
penny
to
go
for
murchison
and
sat
cowering
over
the
fire
until
he
came
well
you
got
a
bad
cold
said
the
doctor
after
examining
him
you
better
get
to
bed
for
the
present
you
be
safe
there
is
it
dangerous
faltered
the
steward
and
keep
yourself
warm
said
the
doctor
who
was
not
in
the
habit
of
taking
his
patients
into
his
confidence
i
send
round
some
medicine
i
should
like
miss
nugent
to
know
i
bad
said
wilks
in
a
weak
voice
she
knows
that
replied
murchison
she
was
telling
me
about
you
the
other
day
he
put
his
hand
up
to
his
neat
black
moustache
to
hide
a
smile
and
met
the
steward
indignant
gaze
without
flinching
i
mean
ill
said
the
latter
sharply
oh
yes
said
the
other
well
you
get
to
bed
now
good
morning
he
took
up
his
hat
and
stick
and
departed
wilks
sat
for
a
little
while
over
the
fire
and
then
rising
hobbled
slowly
upstairs
to
bed
and
forgot
his
troubles
in
sleep
he
slept
until
the
afternoon
and
then
raising
himself
in
bed
listened
to
the
sounds
of
stealthy
sweeping
in
the
room
below
chairs
were
being
moved
about
and
the
tinkle
of
ornaments
on
the
mantelpiece
announced
that
dusting
operations
were
in
progress
he
lay
down
again
with
a
satisfied
smile
it
was
like
a
tale
in
a
the
faithful
old
servant
and
his
master
daughter
he
closed
his
eyes
as
he
heard
her
coming
upstairs
ah
pore
dear
said
a
voice
wilks
opened
his
eyes
sharply
and
beheld
the
meagre
figure
of
mrs
silk
in
one
hand
she
held
a
and
a
glass
and
in
the
other
paper
and
firewood
illustration
the
meagre
figure
of
mrs
silk
i
only
of
it
half
an
hour
ago
she
said
reproachfully
i
saw
the
doctor
boy
and
i
left
my
work
and
came
over
at
once
why
you
let
me
know
wilks
muttered
that
he
did
know
and
lay
crossly
regarding
his
attentive
neighbour
as
she
knelt
down
and
daintily
lit
the
fire
this
task
finished
she
proceeded
to
make
the
room
tidy
and
then
set
about
making
in
a
little
saucepan
you
lay
still
and
get
well
she
remarked
with
tender
playfulness
that
all
you
got
to
do
me
and
teddy
look
after
you
i
could
think
of
troubling
you
said
the
steward
earnestly
it
no
trouble
was
the
reply
you
do
think
i
leave
you
here
alone
helpless
do
you
i
was
going
to
send
for
old
jackson
if
i
did
get
well
said
wilks
mrs
silk
shook
her
head
at
him
and
after
punching
up
his
pillow
took
an
easy
chair
by
the
fire
and
sat
there
musing
edward
silk
came
in
to
tea
and
after
remarking
that
wilks
was
very
flushed
and
had
got
a
nasty
look
about
the
eyes
and
a
cough
which
he
did
like
fell
to
discoursing
on
good
nursing
is
the
principal
thing
said
his
mother
i
nursed
my
pore
dear
all
through
his
last
illness
he
could
bear
me
to
be
out
of
the
room
i
nursed
my
mother
right
up
to
the
last
and
your
pore
aunt
jane
went
off
in
my
arms
wilks
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
and
his
eyes
shone
feverishly
in
the
lamplight
i
think
i
get
a
nurse
he
said
decidedly
nonsense
said
mrs
silk
it
no
trouble
to
me
at
all
i
like
nursing
always
did
wilks
lay
back
again
and
closing
his
eyes
determined
to
ask
the
doctor
to
provide
a
duly
qualified
nurse
on
the
morrow
to
his
disappointment
however
the
doctor
failed
to
come
and
although
he
felt
much
better
mrs
silk
sternly
negatived
a
desire
on
his
part
to
get
up
not
till
the
doctor
been
she
said
firmly
i
could
think
of
it
i
do
believe
there
anything
the
matter
with
me
now
he
declared
odd
very
odd
that
you
should
say
that
said
mrs
silk
clasping
her
hands
odd
repeated
the
steward
somewhat
crustily
how
do
you
mean
odd
they
was
the
very
last
words
my
uncle
benjamin
ever
uttered
in
this
life
said
mrs
silk
with
dramatic
impressiveness
the
steward
was
silent
then
with
the
ominous
precedent
of
uncle
benjamin
before
him
he
began
to
talk
until
scores
of
words
stood
between
himself
and
a
similar
ending
teddy
asked
to
be
remembered
to
you
as
went
off
this
morning
said
mrs
silk
pausing
in
her
labours
at
the
grate
i
much
obliged
muttered
the
invalid
he
did
time
to
come
in
pursued
the
widow
you
can
believe
what
a
lot
thinks
of
you
wilks
the
last
words
he
said
to
me
was
me
know
at
once
if
there
any
change
wilks
distinctly
felt
a
cold
clammy
sensation
down
his
spine
and
little
quivering
thrills
ran
up
and
down
his
legs
he
glared
indignantly
at
the
back
of
the
industrious
mrs
silk
teddy
very
fond
of
you
continued
the
unconscious
woman
i
it
not
a
father
but
he
seems
to
me
to
think
more
of
you
than
else
in
the
wide
wide
world
i
get
quite
jealous
sometimes
only
the
other
day
i
said
to
joking
like
you
better
go
and
live
with
if
you
so
fond
of
i
said
ha
ha
laughed
wilks
uneasily
you
never
guess
what
said
then
said
mrs
silk
dropping
her
dustpan
and
brush
and
gazing
at
the
hearth
said
could
leave
you
i
guessed
the
steward
gruffly
well
now
exclaimed
mrs
silk
clapping
her
hands
if
you
nearly
guessed
it
well
there
i
never
did
i
would
told
you
for
anything
if
you
said
that
the
exact
words
what
did
say
was
without
you
mother
wilks
closed
his
eyes
with
a
snap
and
his
heart
turned
to
water
he
held
his
breath
and
his
brain
in
vain
for
a
reply
which
should
ignore
the
inner
meaning
of
the
fatal
words
something
careless
and
jocular
he
wanted
combined
with
a
voice
which
should
be
perfectly
under
control
failing
these
things
he
kept
his
eyes
closed
and
very
indeed
feigned
sleep
he
slept
straight
away
from
eleven
in
the
morning
until
edward
silk
came
in
at
seven
in
the
evening
i
feel
like
a
new
man
he
said
rubbing
his
eyes
and
yawning
i
do
see
no
change
in
your
appearance
said
the
comforting
youth
much
better
declared
his
mother
that
what
comes
o
good
nursing
some
nurses
would
woke
up
to
take
food
but
i
just
let
sleep
on
people
do
feel
hunger
while
they
asleep
she
busied
herself
over
the
preparation
of
a
basin
of
arrowroot
and
the
steward
despite
his
distaste
for
this
dish
devoured
it
in
a
twinkling
and
a
glass
of
milk
in
addition
failed
to
take
more
than
the
edge
off
his
appetite
we
shall
pull
through
said
mrs
silk
smiling
as
she
put
down
the
empty
glass
in
a
fortnight
he
be
on
feet
it
is
a
matter
of
history
that
wilks
was
on
his
feet
at
five
the
next
morning
and
not
only
on
his
feet
but
dressed
and
ready
for
a
journey
after
such
a
breakfast
as
he
had
not
made
for
many
a
day
the
discourtesy
involved
in
the
disregard
of
the
doctor
instructions
did
not
trouble
him
and
he
smirked
with
some
satisfaction
as
he
noiselessly
closed
his
door
behind
him
and
looked
at
the
drawn
blinds
opposite
the
stars
were
paling
as
he
quitted
the
alley
and
made
his
way
to
the
railway
station
a
note
on
his
tumbled
pillow
after
thanking
mrs
silk
for
her
care
of
him
informed
her
that
he
was
quite
well
and
had
gone
to
london
in
search
of
the
missing
captain
hardy
who
had
heard
from
edward
silk
of
the
steward
indisposition
and
had
been
intending
to
pay
him
a
visit
learnt
of
his
departure
later
on
in
the
morning
and
being
ignorant
of
the
particulars
discoursed
somewhat
eloquently
to
his
partner
on
the
old
man
devotion
h
may
be
said
swann
taking
off
his
glasses
and
looking
at
him
but
you
do
think
captain
nugent
is
in
london
do
you
why
not
inquired
hardy
somewhat
startled
if
what
wilks
told
you
is
true
nathan
smith
knows
said
the
other
i
ask
him
you
do
expect
to
get
the
truth
out
of
him
do
you
inquired
hardy
superciliously
i
do
said
his
partner
serenely
and
when
i
got
it
i
shall
go
and
tell
them
at
equator
lodge
it
will
be
doing
those
two
poor
ladies
a
service
to
let
them
know
what
has
really
happened
to
the
captain
i
walk
round
to
nathan
smith
with
you
said
hardy
i
should
like
to
hear
what
the
fellow
has
to
say
no
i
go
alone
said
his
partner
smith
a
very
shy
man
painfully
shy
i
run
across
him
once
or
twice
before
he
almost
as
bashful
and
retiring
as
you
are
hardy
grunted
if
the
captain
is
in
london
where
is
he
he
inquired
the
other
shook
his
head
i
got
an
idea
he
replied
but
i
want
to
make
sure
kybird
and
smith
are
old
friends
as
nugent
might
have
known
only
he
was
always
too
high
and
mighty
to
take
any
interest
in
his
inferiors
there
something
for
you
to
go
on
he
bent
over
his
desk
again
and
worked
steadily
until
one
his
hour
for
lunching
then
he
put
on
his
hat
and
coat
and
after
a
comfortable
meal
sallied
out
in
search
of
smith
illustration
in
search
of
mr
smith
the
an
old
and
dilapidated
building
was
in
a
bystreet
convenient
to
the
harbour
the
front
door
stood
open
and
a
couple
of
seamen
lounging
on
the
broken
steps
made
way
for
him
civilly
as
he
entered
and
rapped
on
the
bare
boards
with
his
stick
smith
clattering
down
the
stairs
in
response
had
some
difficulty
in
concealing
his
surprise
at
the
visit
but
entered
genially
into
a
conversation
about
the
weather
a
subject
in
which
he
was
much
interested
when
the
began
to
discuss
the
object
of
his
visit
he
led
him
to
a
small
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
repeated
the
information
he
had
given
to
wilks
that
all
there
is
to
tell
he
concluded
artlessly
the
was
that
ashamed
of
hisself
he
laying
low
for
a
bit
we
all
make
mistakes
sometimes
i
do
myself
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
said
swann
gratefully
you
quite
welcome
sir
said
the
and
now
said
the
visitor
musingly
now
for
the
police
police
repeated
smith
almost
hastily
what
for
why
to
find
the
captain
said
swann
in
a
surprised
voice
smith
shook
his
head
you
offend
the
bitter
if
you
go
to
the
police
about
sir
he
declared
his
last
words
to
me
was
this
kept
quiet
it
be
a
little
job
for
the
police
urged
the
shipbroker
they
do
have
much
to
do
down
here
they
be
as
pleased
as
possible
they
worry
your
life
out
of
you
sir
said
the
other
you
know
what
they
are
i
like
a
little
excitement
returned
swann
i
do
suppose
they
trouble
me
much
but
they
turn
your
place
i
expect
still
that
ca
be
helped
you
know
what
fools
the
police
are
they
think
you
murdered
the
captain
and
hidden
his
body
under
the
boards
they
have
all
the
floors
up
ha
ha
ha
floors
up
do
seem
to
me
to
be
so
amusing
as
wot
it
does
to
you
remarked
smith
coldly
they
may
find
all
sorts
of
treasure
for
you
continued
his
visitor
it
a
very
old
house
smith
and
there
may
be
bags
of
guineas
hidden
away
under
the
flooring
you
may
be
able
to
retire
you
a
gentleman
as
is
fond
of
his
joke
swann
returned
the
lugubriously
i
wish
i
got
that
way
of
looking
at
things
you
i
not
joking
smith
said
the
other
quietly
smith
pondered
and
stealing
a
at
him
stood
scraping
his
foot
along
the
floor
there
ai
nothing
much
to
tell
he
grumbled
and
mind
the
worst
favour
you
could
do
to
the
would
be
to
put
it
about
how
he
was
done
he
gone
for
a
little
trip
instead
of
son
that
all
little
trip
repeated
the
other

call
a
whaling
cruise

little
trip

said
smith
in
a
shocked
voice
i
ai
so
bad
as
that

got
some

little
trip

was

it
punishable
demanded
the
shipbroker
recovering
smith
shook
his
head
and
became
serious
the
fell
into
own
trap
he
said
slowly
there
no
lor
for
he
only
get
laughed
at
the
idea
of
trying
to
get
me
to
put
little
amelia
young
man
away
why
i
was
swann
stared
at
him
and
then
with
a
friendly
good
morning
departed
along
the
passage
he
stopped
and
retracing
his
steps
produced
his
and
offered
the
astonished
a
cigar
i
said
that
gentleman
as
he
watched
the
other
retreating
figure
and
dubiously
smelt
the
cigar
i
it
all
right
but
a
larky
sort
and
i
heard
of
exploding
i
give
it
to
kybird
in
case

i
heard
of
exploding
to
smith
great
surprise
his
visitor
sat
down
suddenly
and
began
to
laugh
tears
of
honest
mirth
suffused
his
eyes
and
dimmed
his
glasses
smith
regarding
him
with
an
air
of
kindly
interest

to
laugh

keep
him
company
chapter
xiv
captain
nugent
awoke
the
morning
after
his
attempt
to
crimp
his
son
with
a
bad
headache
not
an
ordinary
headache
to
disappear
with
a
little
cold
water
and
fresh
air
but
a
splitting
racking
affair
which
made
him
feel
all
head
and
dulness
weights
pressed
upon
his
and
the
back
of
his
head
seemed
glued
to
his
pillow
he
groaned
faintly
and
raising
himself
upon
his
elbow
opened
his
eyes
and
sat
up
with
a
sharp
exclamation
his
bed
was
higher
from
the
floor
than
usual
and
moreover
the
floor
was
different
in
the
dim
light
he
distinctly
saw
a
ship
forecastle
untidy
bunks
with
frouzy
bedclothes
and
shiny
hanging
from
the
bulkhead
for
a
few
moments
he
stared
about
in
mystification
he
was
certainly
ill
and
no
doubt
the
forecastle
was
an
hallucination
it
was
a
strange
symptom
and
the
odd
part
of
it
was
that
everything
was
so
distinct
even
the
smell
he
stared
harder
in
the
hope
that
his
surroundings
would
give
place
to
the
usual
ones
and
leaning
a
little
bit
more
on
his
elbow
nearly
rolled
out
of
the
bunk
resolved
to
probe
this
mystery
to
the
bottom
he
lowered
himself
to
the
floor
and
felt
distinctly
the
motion
of
a
ship
at
sea
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
he
staggered
to
the
door
and
holding
by
the
side
looked
on
to
the
deck
the
steamer
was
rolling
in
a
fresh
sea
and
a
sweet
strong
wind
blew
refreshingly
into
his
face
funnels
bridge
and
masts
swung
with
a
rhythmical
motion
loose
gear
rattled
and
every
now
and
then
a
distant
tinkle
sounded
faintly
from
the
pantry
he
stood
bewildered
trying
to
piece
together
the
events
of
the
preceding
night
and
to
try
and
understand
by
what
miracle
he
was
back
on
board
his
old
ship
the
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
her
identity
he
knew
every
inch
of
her
and
any
further
confirmation
that
might
be
required
was
fully
supplied
by
the
appearance
of
the
long
lean
figure
of
captain
hardy
on
the
bridge
captain
nugent
took
his
breath
sharply
and
began
to
realize
the
situation
he
stepped
to
the
side
and
looked
over
the
harbour
was
only
a
little
way
astern
and
sunwich
itself
looking
cold
and
cheerless
beyond
the
dirty
tumbling
seas
little
more
than
a
mile
distant
at
the
sight
his
spirits
revived
and
with
a
hoarse
cry
he
ran
shouting
towards
the
bridge
captain
hardy
turned
sharply
at
the
noise
and
recognizing
the
intruder
stood
peering
down
at
him
in
undisguised
amazement
illustration
he
stepped
to
the
side
and
looked
over
put
back
cried
nugent
waving
up
at
him
put
back
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
on
my
ship
inquired
the
astonished
hardy
put
me
ashore
cried
nugent
imperiously
do
waste
time
talking
d
hear
put
me
ashore
the
amazement
died
out
of
hardy
face
and
gave
way
to
an
expression
of
anger
for
a
time
he
regarded
the
red
and
threatening
visage
of
captain
nugent
in
silence
then
he
turned
to
the
second
officer
this
man
is
not
one
of
the
crew
mr
prowle
he
said
in
a
puzzled
voice
no
sir
said
prowle
how
did
he
get
aboard
here
captain
nugent
answered
the
question
himself
i
was
crimped
by
you
and
your
drunken
bullies
he
said
sternly
how
did
this
man
get
aboard
here
repeated
captain
hardy
ignoring
him
he
must
have
concealed
somewhere
sir
said
the
mate
this
is
the
first
i
seen
of
him
a
stowaway
said
the
captain
bending
his
brows
he
must
have
got
some
of
the
crew
to
hide
him
aboard
you
better
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
my
lad
who
are
your
confederates
captain
nugent
shook
with
fury
the
second
mate
had
turned
away
with
his
hand
over
his
mouth
and
a
suspicious
hunching
of
his
shoulders
while
the
steward
who
had
been
standing
by
beat
a
hasty
retreat
and
collapsed
behind
the
if
you
do
put
me
ashore
said
nugent
restraining
his
passion
by
a
strong
effort
i
take
proceedings
against
you
for
crimping
me
the
moment
i
reach
port
get
a
boat
out
and
put
me
aboard
that
smack
he
pointed
as
he
spoke
to
a
smack
which
was
just
on
their
beam
making
slowly
for
the
harbour
when
you
done
issuing
orders
said
the
captain
in
an
indifferent
voice
perhaps
you
explain
what
you
are
doing
aboard
my
crag
captain
nugent
gazed
at
the
stern
of
the
smack
sunwich
was
getting
dim
in
the
distance
and
there
was
no
other
sail
near
he
began
to
realize
that
he
was
in
for
a
long
voyage
i
awoke
this
morning
and
found
myself
in
a
bunk
in
vow
he
said
regarding
hardy
steadily
however
i
got
there
is
probably
best
known
to
yourself
i
hold
you
responsible
for
the
affair
look
here
my
lad
said
captain
hardy
in
patronizing
tones
i
know
how
you
got
aboard
my
ship
and
i
do
care
i
am
willing
to
believe
that
it
was
not
intentional
on
your
part
but
either
the
outcome
of
a
drunken
freak
or
else
a
means
of
escaping
from
some
scrape
you
have
got
into
ashore
that
being
so
i
shall
take
a
merciful
view
of
it
and
if
you
behave
yourself
and
make
yourself
useful
you
will
not
hear
anything
more
of
it
he
has
something
the
look
of
a
seafaring
man
prowle
see
what
you
can
make
of
him
come
along
with
me
my
lad
said
the
grinning
prowle
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
the
captain
turned
with
a
snarl
and
clenching
his
huge
horny
fist
let
drive
full
in
the
other
face
and
knocked
him
off
his
feet
take
that
man
cried
captain
hardy
sharply
take
him
willing
men
sprang
forward
captain
nugent
views
concerning
sailormen
were
well
known
in
sunwich
and
two
of
the
men
present
had
served
under
him
he
went
forward
the
centre
of
an
attentive
and
rotating
circle
and
sadly
out
of
breath
was
bestowed
in
the
forecastle
and
urged
to
listen
to
reason
for
the
remainder
of
the
morning
he
made
no
sign
the
land
was
almost
out
of
sight
and
he
sat
down
quietly
to
consider
his
course
of
action
for
the
next
few
weeks
found
him
still
engrossed
in
thought
and
the
way
in
which
he
received
an
intimation
from
a
seaman
that
his
dinner
was
getting
cold
showed
that
his
spirits
were
still
unquelled
by
the
time
afternoon
came
he
was
faint
with
hunger
and
having
determined
upon
his
course
of
action
he
sent
a
fairly
polite
message
to
captain
hardy
and
asked
for
an
interview
the
captain
who
was
resting
from
his
labours
in
the
received
him
with
the
same
air
of
cold
severity
which
had
so
endeared
captain
nugent
himself
to
his
subordinates
you
have
come
to
explain
your
extraordinary
behaviour
of
this
morning
i
suppose
he
said
curtly
i
have
come
to
secure
a
berth
aft
said
captain
nugent
i
will
pay
a
small
deposit
now
and
you
will
of
course
have
the
balance
as
soon
as
we
get
back
this
is
without
prejudice
to
any
action
i
may
bring
against
you
later
on
oh
indeed
said
the
other
raising
his
eyebrows
we
do
take
passengers
i
am
here
against
my
will
said
captain
and
i
demand
the
treatment
due
to
my
position
if
i
had
treated
you
properly
said
captain
hardy
i
should
have
put
you
in
irons
for
knocking
down
my
second
officer
i
know
nothing
about
you
or
your
position
you
a
stowaway
and
you
must
do
the
best
you
can
in
the
circumstances
are
you
going
to
give
me
a
cabin
demanded
the
other
menacingly
certainly
not
said
captain
hardy
i
have
been
making
inquiries
and
i
find
that
you
have
only
yourself
to
thank
for
the
position
in
which
you
find
yourself
i
am
sorry
to
be
harsh
with
you
harsh
repeated
the
other
hardly
able
to
believe
his
ears
you
harsh
to
me
but
it
is
for
your
own
good
pursued
captain
hardy
it
is
no
pleasure
to
me
to
punish
you
i
shall
keep
an
eye
on
you
while
you
aboard
and
if
i
see
that
your
conduct
is
improving
you
will
find
that
i
am
not
a
hard
man
to
get
on
with
captain
nugent
stared
at
him
with
his
lips
parted
three
times
he
essayed
to
speak
and
failed
then
he
turned
sharply
and
gaining
the
open
air
stood
for
some
time
trying
to
regain
his
composure
before
going
forward
again
the
first
mate
who
was
on
the
bridge
regarded
him
curiously
and
then
with
an
insufferable
air
of
authority
ordered
him
away
the
captain
obeyed
mechanically
and
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
the
inquiries
of
the
men
prepared
to
make
the
best
of
an
intolerable
situation
and
began
to
cleanse
his
bunk
first
of
all
he
took
out
the
bedding
and
shook
it
thoroughly
and
then
soap
and
a
bucket
of
water
began
to
scrub
with
a
will
hostile
comments
followed
the
action
we
ai
clean
enough
for
said
one
voice
partikler
old
party
ai
he

said
another

the
man
addressed
surveying
the
efforts
with
a
smile
of
approval

you

there
a
little
bit
there
you

you

keep
your
head
out
of
the
way
unless
you
want
it
knocked
off
said
the
incensed
captain
ho
said
the
aggrieved
bill
ho
indeed
d
that
mates
a
man
mus
look
at
own
bunk
now
the
captain
turned
as
though
he
had
been
stung
this
is
my
bunk
he
said
sharply
ho
is
it
said
bill
beggin
of
your
pardon
an
apologizing
for
of
you
but
it
mine
you
have
got
no
bunk
i
slept
in
it
last
night
said
the
captain
conclusively
i
know
you
did
said
bill
but
that
was
all
my
and
a
quid
bill
a
voice
reminded
him
and
a
quid
assented
bill
graciously
and
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
mate
for
the
careful
and
tidy
way
in
which
you
cleaned
up
arter
the
captain
eyed
him
many
years
of
command
at
sea
had
given
him
a
fine
manner
and
force
of
habit
was
for
a
moment
almost
too
much
for
bill
and
his
friends
but
only
for
a
moment
i
going
to
keep
this
bunk
said
the
captain
deliberately
no
you
ai
mate
said
bill
shaking
his
head
do
you
believe
it
you
nobody
down
here
not
even
a
ordinary
seaman
i
afraid
you
to
clean
a
place
for
yourself
on
the
carpet
there
a
nice
corner
over
there
when
i
get
back
said
the
furious
captain
some
of
you
will
go
to
gaol
for
last
night
work
do
be
hard
on
us
said
a
mocking
voice
we
did
our
best
it
our
fault
that
you
look
so
ridikerlously
young
that
we
took
you
for
your
own
son
and
you
was
in
that
state
that
you
could
contradict
us
said
another
man
if
it
is
your
bunk
said
the
captain
sternly
i
suppose
you
have
a
right
to
it
but
perhaps
you
sell
it
to
me
how
much
now
you
talking
bisness
said
the
highly
gratified
bill
turning
with
a
threatening
gesture
upon
a
speculator
opposite
wot
do
you
say
to
a
couple
o
pounds
the
captain
nodded
couple
o
pounds
money
down
said
bill
holding
out
his
hand
the
captain
examined
the
contents
of
his
pocket
and
after
considerable
friction
bought
the
bunk
for
a
pound
cash
and
an
i
o
u
for
the
balance
a
more
humane
man
would
have
shown
a
little
concern
as
to
his
benefactor
but
the
captain
never
gave
the
matter
a
thought
in
fact
it
was
not
until
three
days
later
that
he
discovered
there
was
a
spare
bunk
in
the
forecastle
and
that
the
unscrupulous
seaman
was
occupying
it
it
was
only
one
of
many
annoyances
but
the
captain
realizing
his
impotence
made
no
sign
from
certain
remarks
let
fall
in
his
hearing
he
had
no
difficulty
in
connecting
kybird
with
his
discomfiture
and
of
his
own
desire
he
freely
included
the
unfortunate
wilks
he
passed
his
time
in
devising
schemes
of
vengeance
and
when
captain
hardy
relenting
offered
him
a
cabin
aft
he
sent
back
such
a
message
of
refusal
that
the
steward
spent
half
an
hour
preparing
a
paraphrase
the
offer
was
not
repeated
and
the
captain
despite
the
strong
representations
of
bill
and
his
friends
continued
to
eat
the
bread
of
idleness
before
the
mast
chapter
xv
adolphus
swann
spent
a
very
agreeable
afternoon
after
his
interview
with
nathan
smith
in
refusing
to
satisfy
what
he
termed
the
idle
curiosity
of
his
partner
the
secret
of
captain
nugent
whereabouts
he
declared
was
not
to
be
told
to
everybody
but
was
to
be
confided
by
a
man
of
insinuating
address
and
appearance
here
he
looked
at
himself
in
a
to
miss
nugent
to
be
broken
to
her
by
a
man
with
no
ulterior
motives
for
his
visit
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
but
not
too
old
for
a
little
tender
sympathy
i
had
hoped
to
have
gone
this
afternoon
he
said
with
a
glance
at
the
clock
but
i
afraid
i
ca
get
away
have
you
got
much
to
do
hardy
no
said
his
partner
briskly
i
finished
then
perhaps
you
would
mind
doing
my
work
for
me
so
that
i
can
go
said
swann
mildly
hardy
played
with
his
pen
the
senior
partner
had
been
amusing
himself
at
his
expense
for
some
time
and
in
the
hope
of
a
favour
at
his
hands
he
had
endured
it
with
unusual
patience
four
murmured
the
senior
partner
had
you
better
see
about
making
yourself
presentable
hardy
illustration
had
you
better
see
about
making
yourself
presentable
hardy
thanks
said
the
other
with
alacrity
as
he
took
off
his
coat
and
crossed
over
to
the
little
washstand
in
five
minutes
he
had
finished
his
toilet
and
giving
his
partner
a
little
friendly
pat
on
the
shoulder
locked
up
his
desk
well
he
said
at
last
well
repeated
swann
with
a
little
surprise
what
am
i
to
tell
them
inquired
hardy
struggling
to
keep
his
temper
tell
them
repeated
the
innocent
swann
lor
bless
my
soul
how
you
do
jump
at
conclusions
hardy
i
only
asked
you
to
tidy
yourself
for
my
sake
i
have
an
artistic
eye
i
thought
you
had
done
it
to
please
me
when
you
tired
of
this
nonsense
said
the
indignant
hardy
i
shall
be
glad
swann
looked
him
over
carefully
and
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
his
patience
was
exhausted
told
him
the
result
of
his
inquiries
his
immediate
reward
was
the
utter
incredulity
of
hardy
together
with
some
pungent
criticisms
of
his
veracity
when
the
young
man
did
realize
at
last
that
he
was
speaking
the
truth
he
fell
to
wondering
blankly
what
was
happening
aboard
the
never
mind
about
that
said
the
older
man
for
a
few
weeks
you
have
got
a
clear
field
it
is
quite
a
bond
between
you
both
your
fathers
on
the
same
ship
but
whatever
you
do
do
remind
her
of
the
fate
of
the
kilkenny
cats
draw
a
fancy
picture
of
the
two
fathers
sitting
with
their
arms
about
each
other
waists
and
wondering
whether
their
children
hardy
left
hurriedly
in
fear
that
his
indignation
at
such
frivolity
should
overcome
his
gratitude
and
he
regretted
as
he
walked
briskly
along
that
the
diffidence
peculiar
to
young
men
in
his
circumstances
had
prevented
him
from
acquainting
his
father
with
the
state
of
his
feelings
towards
kate
nugent
the
idea
of
taking
advantage
of
the
captain
enforced
absence
had
occurred
to
other
people
besides
james
hardy
murchison
who
had
found
the
captain
despite
his
bias
in
his
favour
a
particularly
tiresome
third
was
taking
the
fullest
advantage
of
it
and
kybird
had
also
judged
it
an
admirable
opportunity
for
paying
a
first
call
kybird
who
had
not
taken
her
into
his
confidence
in
the
affair
protested
in
vain
the
lady
was
determined
and
moreover
had
the
warm
support
of
her
daughter
i
know
what
i
doing
she
said
to
her
husband
kybird
doubted
it
but
held
his
peace
and
the
objections
of
jack
nugent
who
found
to
his
dismay
that
he
was
to
be
of
the
party
were
deemed
too
trivial
to
be
worthy
of
serious
consideration
they
started
shortly
after
jem
hardy
had
left
his
office
despite
the
fact
that
kybird
who
was
troubled
with
asthma
was
suffering
untold
agonies
in
a
black
satin
dress
which
had
been
originally
made
for
a
much
smaller
woman
and
had
come
into
her
husband
hands
in
the
way
of
business
it
got
into
hers
in
what
the
defrauded
kybird
considered
an
extremely
unbusinesslike
manner
and
it
was
not
without
a
certain
amount
of
satisfaction
that
he
regarded
her
discomfiture
as
the
party
sallied
out
illustration
it
was
not
without
a
certain
amount
of
satisfaction
that
he
regarded
her
discomfiture
nugent
was
not
happy
kybird
in
the
snug
seclusion
of
the
back
parlour
was
one
thing
kybird
in
black
satin
at
its
utmost
tension
and
a
circular
hat
set
with
sable
ostrich
plumes
nodding
in
the
breeze
was
another
he
felt
that
the
public
eye
was
upon
them
and
that
it
twinkled
his
gaze
wandered
from
mother
to
daughter
what
are
you
staring
at
demanded
miss
kybird
pertly
i
was
thinking
how
well
you
are
looking
was
the
reply
miss
kybird
smiled
she
had
hoisted
some
daring
colours
but
she
was
of
a
bold
type
and
carried
them
fairly
well
if
i
the
woman
what
made
this
dress
gasped
kybird
as
she
stopped
with
her
hand
on
her
side
i
give
her
a
bit
o
my
mind
i
never
saw
you
look
so
well
in
anything
before
ma
said
her
daughter
kybird
smiled
faintly
and
continued
her
pilgrimage
jem
hardy
coming
up
rapidly
behind
composed
his
amused
features
and
stepped
into
the
road
to
pass
halloa
hardy
said
nugent
going
home
i
am
calling
on
your
sister
said
hardy
bowing
by
jove
so
are
we
said
nugent
relieved
to
find
this
friend
in
need
we
go
together
you
know
kybird
and
miss
kybird
that
is
mrs
kybird
kybird
bade
him
go
along
do
and
acknowledged
the
introduction
with
as
stately
a
bow
as
the
black
satin
would
permit
and
before
the
dazed
jem
quite
knew
how
it
all
happened
he
was
leading
the
way
with
kybird
while
the
young
people
as
she
called
them
followed
behind
we
ai
looking
at
you
she
said
playfully
over
her
shoulder
and
we
trying
to
shut
our
eyes
to
your
goings
on
retorted
nugent
kybird
stopped
and
with
a
reached
for
him
with
her
umbrella
the
exertion
and
the
joke
combined
took
the
remnant
of
her
breath
away
and
she
stood
still
panting
you
had
better
take
hardy
arm
i
think
said
nugent
with
affected
solicitude
it
my
breath
explained
kybird
turning
to
the
fuming
young
man
by
her
side
i
can
get
along
for
it
i
much
obliged
to
you
i
sure
hardy
with
a
vain
attempt
to
catch
jack
nugent
eye
resigned
himself
to
his
fate
and
with
his
fair
burden
on
his
arm
walked
with
painful
slowness
towards
equator
lodge
a
ribald
voice
from
the
other
side
of
the
road
addressing
his
companion
as
mother
kybird
told
her
not
to
hug
the
man
and
a
small
boy
whom
they
met
loudly
asseverated
his
firm
intention
of
going
straight
off
to
tell
kybird
illustration
hardy
resigned
himself
to
his
fate
by
the
time
they
reached
the
house
hardy
entertained
views
on
homicide
which
would
have
appeared
impossible
to
him
half
an
hour
before
he
flushed
crimson
as
he
saw
the
astonished
face
of
kate
nugent
at
the
window
and
pausing
at
the
gate
to
wait
for
the
others
discovered
that
they
had
disappeared
a
rooted
dislike
to
scenes
of
any
kind
together
with
a
keen
eye
for
the
ludicrous
had
prompted
jack
nugent
to
suggest
a
pleasant
stroll
to
amelia
and
put
in
an
appearance
later
on
we
wo
wait
for
said
kybird
with
decision
if
i
do
get
a
sit
down
soon
i
shall
drop
still
clinging
to
the
reluctant
hardy
she
walked
up
the
path
farther
back
in
the
darkness
of
the
room
the
unfortunate
young
gentleman
saw
the
faces
of
murchison
and
kingdom
and
are
you
bella
inquired
kybird
with
kindly
condescension
is
kingdom
at
she
pushed
her
way
past
the
astonished
bella
and
followed
by
hardy
entered
the
room
kingdom
with
a
red
spot
on
each
cheek
rose
to
receive
them
i
ought
to
come
before
said
kybird
subsiding
thankfully
into
a
chair
but
i
such
a
bad
walker
i
i
see
you
well
we
are
very
well
thank
you
said
kingdom
stiffly
that
right
said
her
visitor
cordially
what
a
blessing
is
what
should
we
do
without
it
i
wonder
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
shook
her
head
at
the
prospect
there
was
an
awkward
lull
and
in
the
offended
gaze
of
miss
nugent
hardy
saw
only
too
plainly
that
he
was
held
responsible
for
the
appearance
of
the
unwelcome
visitor
i
was
coming
to
see
you
he
said
leaving
his
chair
and
taking
one
near
her
i
met
your
brother
coming
along
and
he
introduced
me
to
kybird
and
her
daughter
and
suggested
we
should
come
together
miss
nugent
received
the
information
with
a
civil
bow
and
renewed
her
conversation
with
murchison
whose
face
showed
such
a
keen
appreciation
of
the
situation
that
hardy
had
some
difficulty
in
masking
his
feelings
they
a
long
time
said
kybird
smiling
archly
but
there
when
young
people
are
keeping
company
they
forget
everything
and
everybody
they
did
trouble
about
me
if
it
been
for
giving
me
arm
i
should
never
got
here
there
was
a
prolonged
silence
murchison
gave
a
whimsical
glance
at
miss
nugent
and
meeting
no
response
in
that
lady
indignant
eyes
stroked
his
moustache
and
awaited
events
it
looks
as
though
your
brother
is
not
coming
said
hardy
to
miss
nugent
he
turn
up
interposed
kybird
looking
somewhat
morosely
at
the
company
they
do
notice
the
time
flies
all
time
does
go
murmured
kingdom
with
a
glance
at
the
clock
kybird
started
ah
and
we
notice
it
too
at
our
age
she
said
sweetly
as
she
settled
herself
in
her
chair
and
clasped
her
hands
in
her
lap
i
ca
looking
at
you
my
dear
she
continued
looking
over
at
miss
nugent
there
such
a
wonderful
likeness
between
jack
and
you
do
you
think
so
kingdom
in
a
freezing
voice
said
that
she
had
not
noticed
it
of
course
said
kybird
glancing
at
her
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
jack
has
to
rough
it
pore
feller
and
that
left
its
mark
on
i
sure
when
we
took
in
he
was
quite
done
up
so
to
speak
he
only
got
what
stood
up
in
and
the
only
pair
of
socks
he
got
to
his
feet
was
in
such
a
state
of
that
they
had
to
be
throwed
away
i
throwed
away
myself
dear
me
said
kingdom
he
do
look
like
the
same
feller
now
continued
the
amiable
kybird
good
living
and
good
clothes
worked
wonders
in
sure
if
he
been
my
own
son
i
could
done
more
for
and
as
for
kybird
he
like
a
father
to
him
dear
me
said
kingdom
again
kybird
looked
at
her
it
was
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
to
call
her
a
poll
parrot
she
was
a
woman
as
a
rule
and
it
was
terrible
to
have
to
sit
still
and
waste
all
the
good
things
she
could
have
said
to
her
in
favour
of
unsatisfying
she
sat
smouldering
i
you
miss
the
very
much
she
said
at
last
very
much
was
the
reply
and
i
should
think
misses
you
retorted
kybird
unable
to
restrain
herself
must
miss
your
conversation
and
what
i
might
call
your
liveliness
kingdom
turned
and
regarded
her
and
the
red
stole
back
to
her
cheeks
again
she
smoothed
down
her
dress
and
her
hands
trembled
both
ladies
were
now
regarding
each
other
in
a
fashion
which
caused
serious
apprehension
to
the
rest
of
the
company
i
am
not
a
great
talker
but
i
am
very
careful
whom
i
converse
with
said
kingdom
in
her
most
stately
manner
i
knew
a
lady
like
that
once
said
kybird
leastways
she
a
lady
she
added
meditatively
kingdom
fidgeted
and
looked
over
piteously
at
her
niece
kybird
with
a
satisfied
sniff
sat
bolt
upright
and
meditated
further
assaults
there
were
at
least
a
score
of
things
she
could
have
said
about
her
adversary
cap
alone
plain
straightforward
remarks
which
would
have
torn
it
to
shreds
the
cap
fascinated
her
and
her
fingers
itched
as
she
gazed
at
it
in
more
congenial
surroundings
she
might
have
snatched
at
it
but
being
a
woman
of
strong
character
she
suppressed
her
natural
instincts
and
confined
herself
to
more
polite
methods
of
attack
your
nephew
do
seem
to
be
in
no
hurry
she
remarked
at
length
but
there
direckly
gets
along
o
my
daughter
forgits
everything
and
everybody
i
really
do
think
he
is
coming
said
hardy
moved
to
speech
by
the
glances
of
miss
nugent
i
shall
give
him
a
little
longer
said
kybird
i
only
came
to
please
and
to
get
alone
is
more
than
i
can
do
miss
nugent
looked
at
hardy
and
her
eyes
were
soft
and
expressive
as
plainly
as
eyes
could
speak
they
asked
him
to
take
kybird
home
lest
worse
things
should
happen
would
it
be
far
out
of
your
way
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
quite
the
opposite
direction
returned
hardy
firmly
how
i
got
i
do
know
said
kybird
addressing
the
room
in
general
it
a
wonder
to
me
well
once
is
enough
in
a
lifetime
hardy
said
kate
nugent
again
in
a
low
voice
i
should
be
so
much
obliged
if
you
would
take
kybird
away
she
seems
bent
on
quarrelling
with
my
aunt
it
is
very
awkward
it
was
difficult
to
resist
the
entreaty
but
hardy
had
a
very
fair
idea
of
the
duration
of
miss
nugent
gratitude
and
besides
that
murchison
was
only
too
plainly
enjoying
his
discomfiture
she
can
get
home
alone
all
right
he
whispered
miss
nugent
drew
herself
up
disdainfully
murchison
looking
scandalized
at
his
brusqueness
hastened
to
the
rescue
as
a
medical
man
he
said
with
a
considerable
appearance
of
gravity
i
do
think
that
kybird
ought
to
go
home
alone
think
not
inquired
hardy
grimly
certain
of
it
breathed
the
doctor
well
why
do
you
take
her
retorted
hardy
it
all
on
your
way
i
have
some
news
for
miss
nugent
miss
nugent
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
mischievous
lights
appeared
in
her
eyes
as
she
gazed
at
the
carefully
groomed
and
fastidious
murchison
from
them
she
looked
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
where
kybird
was
stolidly
eyeing
kingdom
who
was
trying
in
vain
to
appear
ignorant
of
the
fact
illustration
the
carefully
groomed
and
fastidious
murchison
thank
you
very
much
said
miss
nugent
turning
to
the
doctor
i
sorry
began
murchison
with
an
indignant
glance
at
his
rival
oh
as
you
please
said
the
girl
coldly
pray
forgive
me
for
asking
you
if
you
really
wish
it
said
the
doctor
rising
miss
nugent
smiled
upon
him
and
hardy
also
gave
him
a
smile
of
kindly
encouragement
but
this
he
ignored
he
crossed
the
room
and
bade
kingdom
and
then
in
a
few
disjointed
words
asked
kybird
whether
he
could
be
of
any
assistance
in
seeing
her
home
i
sure
i
much
obliged
to
you
said
that
lady
as
she
rose
it
do
seem
much
use
for
me
waiting
for
my
future
i
wish
you
good
afternoon
i
can
understand
now
why
jack
did
come
with
this
parting
shot
she
quitted
the
room
and
leaning
on
the
arm
sailed
majestically
down
the
path
to
the
gate
every
feather
on
her
hat
trembling
in
response
to
the
excitement
below
of
him
said
hardy
glancing
from
the
window
with
a
triumphant
smile
very
said
miss
nugent
coldly
as
she
took
a
seat
by
her
aunt
what
is
the
news
to
which
you
referred
just
now
is
it
about
my
father
