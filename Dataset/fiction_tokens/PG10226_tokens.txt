preface
beautiful
joe
is
a
real
dog
and
beautiful
joe
is
his
real
name
he
belonged
during
the
first
part
of
his
life
to
a
cruel
master
who
mutilated
him
in
the
manner
described
in
the
story
he
was
rescued
from
him
and
is
now
living
in
a
happy
home
with
pleasant
surroundings
and
enjoys
a
wide
local
celebrity
the
character
of
laura
is
drawn
from
life
and
to
the
smallest
detail
is
truthfully
depicted
the
morris
family
has
its
counterparts
in
real
life
and
nearly
all
of
the
incidents
of
the
story
are
founded
on
the
author
introduction
the
wonderfully
successful
book
entitled
black
beauty
came
like
a
living
voice
out
of
the
animal
kingdom
but
it
spake
for
the
horse
and
made
other
books
necessary
it
led
the
way
after
the
ready
welcome
that
it
received
and
the
good
it
has
accomplished
and
is
doing
it
followed
naturally
that
some
one
should
be
inspired
to
write
a
book
to
interpret
the
life
of
a
dog
to
the
humane
feeling
of
the
world
such
a
story
we
have
in
beautiful
joe
the
story
speaks
not
for
the
dog
alone
but
for
the
whole
animal
kingdom
through
it
we
enter
the
animal
world
and
are
made
to
see
as
animals
see
and
to
feel
as
animals
feel
the
sympathetic
sight
of
the
author
in
this
interpretation
is
ethically
the
strong
feature
of
the
book
such
books
as
this
is
one
of
the
needs
of
our
progressive
system
of
education
the
the
and
all
libraries
for
the
young
demand
the
influence
that
shall
teach
the
reader
how
to
live
in
sympathy
with
the
animal
world
how
to
understand
the
languages
of
the
creatures
that
we
have
long
been
accustomed
to
call
dumb
and
the
sign
language
of
the
lower
orders
of
these
dependent
beings
the
church
owes
it
to
her
mission
to
preach
and
to
teach
the
enforcement
of
the
nest
commandment
the
principle
recognized
by
moses
in
the
hebrew
world
and
echoed
by
cowper
in
english
poetry
and
burns
in
the
meadow
mouse
and
by
our
own
longfellow
in
songs
of
many
keys
kindness
to
the
animal
kingdom
is
the
first
or
a
first
principle

the
growth
of
true
philanthropy
young
lincoln
once
waded
across
a
river
to
rescue
a
dog
and
stopped
in
a
walk
with
a
statesman
to
put
back
a
bird
that
had
fallen
out
of
its
nest
such
a
heart
was
trained
to
be
a
leader
of
men
and
to
be
crucified
for
a
cause
the
conscience
that
runs
to
the
call
of
an
animal
in
distress
is
girding
itself
with
power
to
do
manly
work
in
the
world
the
story
of
beautiful
joe
awakens
an
intense
interest
and
sustains
it
through
a
series
of
vivid
incidents
and
episodes
each
of
which
is
a
lesson
the
story
merits
the
widest
circulation
and
the
universal
reading
and
response
accorded
to
black
beauty
to
circulate
it
is
to
do
good
to
help
the
human
heart
as
well
as
the
creatures
of
quick
feelings
and
simple
language
when
as
one
of
the
committee
to
examine
the
manuscripts
offered
for
prizes
to
the
humane
society
i
read
the
story
i
felt
that
the
writer
had
a
higher
motive
than
to
compete
for
a
prize
that
the
story
was
a
stream
of
sympathy
that
flowed
from
the
heart
that
it
was
genuine
that
it
only
needed
a
publisher
who
should
be
able
to
command
a
wide
influence
to
make
its
merits
known
to
give
it
a
strong
educational
mission
i
am
pleased
that
the
manuscript
has
found
such
a
publisher
and
am
sure
that
the
issue
of
the
story
will
honor
the
publication
society
in
the
development
of
the
book
i
believe
that
the
humane
cause
has
stood
above
any
speculative
thought
or
interest
the
book
comes
because
it
is
called
for
the
times
demand
it
i
think
that
the
publishers
have
a
right
to
ask
for
a
little
unselfish
service
on
the
part
of
the
public
in
helping
to
give
it
a
circulation
commensurate
with
its
opportunity
need
and
influence

only
a
cur
my
name
is
beautiful
joe
and
i
am
a
brown
dog
of
medium
size
i
am
not
called
beautiful
joe
because
i
am
a
beauty
morris
the
clergyman
in
whose
family
i
have
lived
for
the
last
twelve
years
says
that
he
thinks
i
must
be
called
beautiful
joe
for
the
same
reason
that
his
grandfather
down
south
called
a
very
ugly
colored
cupid
and
his
mother
venus
i
do
not
know
what
he
means
by
that
but
when
he
says
it
people
always
look
at
me
and
smile
i
know
that
i
am
not
beautiful
and
i
know
that
i
am
not
a
thoroughbred
i
am
only
a
cur
when
my
mistress
went
every
year
to
register
me
and
pay
my
tax
and
the
man
in
the
office
asked
what
breed
i
was
she
said
part
and
part
but
he
always
put
me
down
a
cur
i
do
think
she
liked
having
him
call
me
a
cur
still
i
have
heard
her
say
that
she
preferred
curs
for
they
have
more
character
than
dogs
her
father
said
that
she
liked
ugly
dogs
for
the
same
reason
that
a
nobleman
at
the
court
of
a
certain
king
did
namely
that
no
one
else
would
i
am
an
old
dog
now
and
am
writing
or
rather
getting
a
friend
to
write
the
story
of
my
life
i
have
seen
my
mistress
laughing
and
crying
over
a
little
book
that
she
says
is
a
story
of
a
horse
life
and
sometimes
she
puts
the
book
down
close
to
my
nose
to
let
me
see
the
pictures
i
love
my
dear
mistress
i
can
say
no
more
than
that
i
love
her
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
and
i
think
it
will
please
her
if
i
write
the
story
of
a
dog
life
she
loves
dumb
animals
and
it
always
grieves
her
to
see
them
treated
cruelly
i
have
heard
her
say
that
if
all
the
boys
and
girls
in
the
world
were
to
rise
up
and
say
that
there
should
be
no
more
cruelty
to
animals
they
could
put
a
stop
to
it
perhaps
it
will
help
a
little
if
i
tell
a
story
i
am
fond
of
boys
and
girls
and
though
i
have
seen
many
cruel
men
and
women
i
have
seen
few
cruel
children
i
think
the
more
stories
there
are
written
about
dumb
animals
the
better
it
will
be
for
us
in
telling
my
story
i
think
i
had
better
begin
at
the
first
and
come
right
on
to
the
end
i
was
born
in
a
stable
on
the
outskirts
of
a
small
town
in
maine
called
fairport
the
first
thing
i
remember
was
lying
close
to
my
mother
and
being
very
snug
and
warm
the
next
thing
i
remember
was
being
always
hungry
i
had
a
number
of
brothers
and
sisters
six
in
all
and
my
mother
never
had
enough
milk
for
us
she
was
always
half
starved
herself
so
she
could
not
feed
us
properly
i
am
very
unwilling
to
say
much
about
my
early
life
i
have
lived
so
long
in
a
family
where
there
is
never
a
harsh
word
spoken
and
where
no
one
thinks
of
anybody
or
anything
that
it
seems
almost
wrong
even
to
think
or
speak
of
such
a
matter
as
hurting
a
poor
dumb
beast
the
man
that
owned
my
mother
was
a
milkman
he
kept
one
horse
and
three
cows
and
he
had
a
shaky
old
cart
that
he
used
to
put
his
milk
cans
in
i
do
think
there
can
be
a
worse
man
in
the
world
than
that
milkman
it
makes
me
shudder
now
to
think
of
him
his
name
was
jenkins
and
i
am
glad
to
think
that
he
is
getting
punished
now
for
his
cruelty
to
poor
dumb
animals
and
to
human
beings
if
you
think
it
is
wrong
that
i
am
glad
you
must
remember
that
i
am
only
a
dog
the
first
notice
that
he
took
of
me
when
i
was
a
little
puppy
just
able
to
stagger
about
was
to
give
me
a
kick
that
sent
me
into
a
corner
of
the
stable
he
used
to
beat
and
starve
my
mother
i
have
seen
him
use
his
heavy
whip
to
punish
her
till
her
body
was
covered
with
blood
when
i
got
older
i
asked
her
why
she
did
not
run
away
she
said
she
did
not
wish
to
but
i
soon
found
out
that
the
reason
she
did
not
run
away
was
because
she
loved
jenkins
cruel
and
savage
as
he
was
she
yet
loved
him
and
i
believe
she
would
have
laid
down
her
life
for
him
now
that
i
am
old
i
know
that
there
are
more
men
in
the
world
like
jenkins
they
are
not
crazy
they
are
not
drunkards
they
simply
seem
to
be
possessed
with
a
spirit
of
wickedness
there
are
people
yes
and
rich
people
who
will
treat
animals
and
even
little
children
with
such
terrible
cruelty
that
one
can
not
even
mention
the
things
that
they
are
guilty
of
one
reason
for
jenkins
cruelty
was
his
idleness
after
he
went
his
rounds
in
the
morning
with
his
milk
cans
he
had
nothing
to
do
till
late
in
the
afternoon
but
take
care
of
his
stable
and
yard
if
he
had
kept
them
neat
and
groomed
his
horse
and
cleaned
the
cows
and
dug
up
the
garden
it
would
have
taken
up
all
his
time
but
he
never
tidied
the
place
at
all
till
his
yard
and
stable
got
so
littered
up
with
things
he
threw
down
that
he
could
not
make
his
way
about
his
house
and
stable
stood
in
the
middle
of
a
large
field
and
they
were
at
some
distance
from
the
road
could
not
see
how
untidy
the
place
was
occasionally
a
man
came
to
look
at
the
premises
and
see
that
they
were
in
good
order
but
jenkins
always
knew
when
to
expect
him
and
had
things
cleaned
up
a
little
i
used
to
wish
that
some
of
the
people
that
took
milk
from
him
would
come
and
look
at
his
cows
in
the
spring
and
summer
he
drove
them
out
to
pasture
but
during
the
winter
they
stood
all
the
time
in
the
dirty
dark
stable
where
the
chinks
in
the
wall
were
so
big
that
the
snow
swept
through
almost
in
drifts
the
ground
was
always
muddy
and
wet
there
was
only
one
small
window
on
the
north
side
where
the
sun
only
shone
in
for
a
short
time
in
the
afternoon
they
were
very
unhappy
cows
but
they
stood
patiently
and
never
complained
though
sometimes
i
know
they
must
have
nearly
frozen
in
the
bitter
winds
that
blew
through
the
stable
on
winter
nights
they
were
lean
and
poor
and
were
never
in
good
health
besides
being
cold
they
were
fed
on
very
poor
food
jenkins
used
to
come
home
nearly
every
afternoon
with
a
great
tub
in
the
back
of
his
cart
that
was
full
of
what
he
called
peelings
it
was
kitchen
stuff
that
he
asked
the
cooks
at
the
different
houses
where
he
delivered
milk
to
save
for
him
they
threw
rotten
vegetables
fruit
parings
and
scraps
from
the
table
into
a
tub
and
gave
them
to
him
at
the
end
of
a
few
days
a
sour
nasty
mess
it
always
was
and
not
fit
to
give
any
creature
sometimes
when
he
had
not
many
peelings
he
would
go
to
town
and
get
a
load
of
decayed
vegetables
that
grocers
were
glad
to
have
him
take
off
their
hands
this
food
together
with
poor
hay
made
the
cows
give
very
poor
milk
and
jenkins
used
to
put
some
white
powder
in
it
to
give
it
body
as
he
said
once
a
very
sad
thing
happened
about
the
milk
that
no
one
knew
about
but
jenkins
and
his
wife
she
was
a
poor
unhappy
creature
very
frightened
at
her
husband
and
not
daring
to
speak
much
to
him
she
was
not
a
clean
woman
and
i
never
saw
a
house
than
she
kept
she
used
to
do
very
queer
things
that
i
know
now
no
housekeeper
should
do
i
have
seen
her
catch
up
the
broom
to
pound
potatoes
in
the
pot
she
pounded
with
the
handle
and
the
broom
would
fly
up
and
down
in
the
air
dropping
dust
into
the
pot
where
the
potatoes
were
her
pan
of
bread
she
often
left
uncovered
in
the
kitchen
and
sometimes
the
hens
walked
in
and
sat
in
it
the
children
used
to
play
in
mud
puddles
about
the
door
it
was
the
youngest
of
them
that
sickened
with
some
kind
of
fever
early
in
the
spring
before
jenkins
began
driving
the
cows
out
to
pasture
the
child
was
very
ill
and
jenkins
wanted
to
send
for
a
doctor
but
her
husband
would
not
let
her
they
made
a
bed
in
the
kitchen
close
to
the
stove
and
jenkins
nursed
the
child
as
best
she
could
she
did
all
her
work
near
by
and
i
saw
her
several
times
wiping
the
child
face
with
the
cloth
that
she
used
for
washing
her
milk
pans
nobody
knew
outside
the
family
that
the
little
girl
was
jenkins
had
such
a
bad
name
that
none
of
the
neighbors
would
visit
them
the
child
got
well
and
a
week
or
two
later
jenkins
came
home
with
quite
a
frightened
face
and
told
his
wife
that
the
husband
of
one
of
his
customers
was
very
ill
with
typhoid
fever
after
a
time
the
gentleman
died
and
the
cook
told
jenkins
that
the
doctor
wondered
how
he
could
have
taken
the
fever
for
there
was
not
a
case
in
town
there
was
a
widow
left
with
three
orphans
and
they
never
knew
that
they
had
to
blame
a
dirty
careless
milkman
for
taking
a
kind
husband
and
father
from
them
chapter
ii
the
cruel
milkman
i
have
said
that
jenkins
spent
most
of
his
days
in
idleness
he
had
to
start
out
very
early
in
the
morning
in
order
to
supply
his
customers
with
milk
for
breakfast
oh
how
ugly
he
used
to
be
when
he
came
into
the
stable
on
cold
winter
mornings
before
the
sun
was
up
he
would
hang
his
lantern
on
a
hook
and
get
his
milking
stool
and
if
the
cows
did
not
step
aside
just
to
suit
him
he
would
seize
a
broom
or
fork
and
beat
them
cruelly
my
mother
and
i
slept
on
a
heap
of
straw
in
the
corner
of
the
stable
and
when
she
heard
his
step
in
the
morning
she
always
roused
me
so
that
we
could
run
as
soon
as
he
opened
the
stable
door
he
always
aimed
a
kick
at
us
as
we
passed
but
my
mother
taught
me
how
to
dodge
him
after
he
finished
milking
he
took
the
pails
of
milk
up
to
the
house
for
jenkins
to
strain
and
put
in
the
cans
and
he
came
back
and
harnessed
his
horse
to
the
cart
his
horse
was
called
toby
and
a
poor
miserable
creature
he
was
he
was
weak
in
the
knees
and
weak
in
the
back
and
weak
all
over
and
jenkins
had
to
beat
him
all
the
time
to
make
him
go
he
had
been
a
cab
horse
and
his
mouth
had
been
jerked
and
twisted
and
sawed
at
till
one
would
think
there
could
be
no
feeling
left
in
it
still
i
have
seen
him
wince
and
curl
up
his
lip
when
jenkins
thrust
in
the
frosty
bit
on
a
winter
morning
poor
old
toby
i
used
to
lie
on
my
straw
sometimes
and
wonder
he
did
not
cry
out
with
pain
cold
and
half
starved
he
always
was
in
the
winter
time
and
often
with
raw
sores
on
his
body
that
jenkins
would
try
to
hide
by
putting
bits
of
cloth
under
the
harness
but
toby
never
murmured
and
he
never
tried
to
kick
and
bite
and
he
minded
the
least
word
from
jenkins
and
if
he
swore
at
him
toby
would
start
back
or
step
up
quickly
he
was
so
anxious
to
please
him
after
jenkins
put
him
in
the
cart
and
took
in
the
cans
he
set
out
on
his
rounds
my
mother
whose
name
was
jess
always
went
with
him
i
used
to
ask
her
why
she
followed
such
a
brute
of
a
man
and
she
would
hang
her
head
and
say
that
sometimes
she
got
a
bone
from
the
different
houses
they
stopped
at
but
that
was
not
the
whole
reason
she
liked
jenkins
so
much
that
she
wanted
to
be
with
him
i
had
not
her
sweet
and
patient
disposition
and
i
would
not
go
with
her
i
watched
her
out
of
sight
and
then
ran
up
to
the
house
to
see
if
jenkins
had
any
scraps
for
me
i
nearly
always
got
something
for
she
pitied
me
and
often
gave
me
a
kind
word
or
look
with
the
bits
of
food
that
she
threw
to
me
when
jenkins
come
home
i
often
coaxed
mother
to
run
about
and
see
some
of
the
neighbors
dogs
with
me
but
she
never
would
and
i
would
not
leave
her
so
from
morning
to
night
we
had
to
sneak
about
keeping
out
of
jenkins
way
as
much
as
we
could
and
yet
trying
to
keep
him
in
sight
he
always
sauntered
about
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
growling
first
at
his
wife
and
children
and
then
at
his
dumb
creatures
i
have
not
told
what
became
of
my
brothers
and
sisters
one
rainy
day
when
we
were
eight
weeks
old
jenkins
followed
by
two
or
three
of
his
ragged
dirty
children
came
into
the
stable
and
looked
at
us
then
he
began
to
swear
because
we
were
so
ugly
and
said
if
we
had
been
he
might
have
sold
some
of
us
mother
watched
him
anxiously
and
fearing
some
danger
to
her
puppies
ran
and
jumped
in
the
middle
of
us
and
looked
pleadingly
up
at
him
it
only
made
him
swear
the
more
he
took
one
pup
after
another
and
right
there
before
his
children
and
my
poor
distracted
mother
put
an
end
to
their
lives
some
of
them
he
seized
by
the
legs
and
knocked
against
the
stalls
till
their
brains
were
dashed
out
others
he
killed
with
a
fork
it
was
very
terrible
my
mother
ran
up
and
down
the
stable
screaming
with
pain
and
i
lay
weak
and
trembling
and
expecting
every
instant
that
my
turn
would
come
next
i
do
know
why
he
spared
me
i
was
the
only
one
left
his
children
cried
and
he
sent
them
out
of
the
stable
and
went
out
himself
mother
picked
up
all
the
puppies
and
brought
them
to
our
nest
in
the
straw
and
licked
them
and
tried
to
bring
them
back
to
life
but
it
was
of
no
use
they
were
quite
dead
we
had
them
in
our
corner
of
the
stable
for
some
days
till
jenkins
discovered
them
and
swearing
horribly
at
us
he
took
his
stable
fork
and
threw
them
out
in
the
yard
and
put
some
earth
over
them
my
mother
never
seemed
the
same
after
this
she
was
weak
and
miserable
and
though
she
was
only
four
years
old
she
seemed
like
an
old
dog
this
was
on
account
of
the
poor
food
she
had
been
fed
on
she
could
not
run
after
jenkins
and
she
lay
on
our
heap
of
straw
only
turning
over
with
her
nose
the
scraps
of
food
i
brought
her
to
eat
one
day
she
licked
me
gently
wagged
her
tail
and
died
as
i
sat
by
her
feeling
lonely
and
miserable
jenkins
came
into
the
stable
i
could
not
bear
to
look
at
him
he
had
killed
my
mother
there
she
lay
a
little
gaunt
scarred
creature
starved
and
worried
to
death
by
him
her
mouth
was
half
open
her
eyes
were
staring
she
would
never
again
look
kindly
at
me
or
curl
up
to
me
at
night
to
keep
me
warm
oh
how
i
hated
her
murderer
but
i
sat
quietly
even
when
he
went
up
and
turned
her
over
with
his
foot
to
see
if
she
was
really
dead
i
think
he
was
a
little
sorry
for
he
turned
scornfully
toward
me
and
said
she
was
worth
two
of
you
why
did
you
go
instead
still
i
kept
quiet
till
he
walked
up
to
me
and
kicked
at
me
my
heart
was
nearly
broken
and
i
could
stand
no
more
i
flew
at
him
and
gave
him
a
savage
bite
on
the
ankle
oho
he
said
so
you
are
going
to
be
a
fighter
are
you
i
fix
you
for
that
his
face
was
red
and
furious
he
seized
me
by
the
back
of
the
neck
and
carried
me
out
to
the
yard
where
a
log
lay
on
the
ground
bill
he
called
to
one
of
his
children
bring
me
the
hatchet
he
laid
my
head
on
the
log
and
pressed
one
hand
on
my
struggling
body
i
was
now
a
year
old
and
a
dog
there
was
a
quick
dreadful
pain
and
he
had
cut
off
my
ear
not
in
the
way
they
cut
puppies
ears
but
close
to
my
head
so
close
that
he
cut
off
some
of
the
skin
beyond
it
then
he
cut
off
the
other
ear
and
turning
me
swiftly
round
cut
off
my
tail
close
to
my
body
then
he
let
me
go
and
stood
looking
at
me
as
i
rolled
on
the
ground
and
yelped
in
agony
he
was
in
such
a
passion
that
he
did
not
think
that
people
passing
by
on
the
road
might
hear
me
chapter
iii
my
kind
deliverer
and
miss
laura
there
was
a
young
man
going
by
on
a
bicycle
he
heard
my
screams
and
springing
off
his
bicycle
came
hurrying
up
the
path
and
stood
among
us
before
jenkins
caught
sight
of
him
in
the
midst
of
my
pain
i
heard
him
in
say
fiercely
what
have
you
been
doing
to
that
dog
i
been
cuttin
his
ears
for
fightin
my
young
gentleman
said
jenkins
there
is
no
law
to
prevent
that
is
there
and
there
is
no
law
to
prevent
my
giving
you
a
beating
said
the
young
man
angrily
in
a
trice
he
had
seized
jenkins
by
the
throat
and
was
pounding
him
with
all
his
might
jenkins
came
and
stood
at
the
house
door
crying
but
making
no
effort
to
help
her
husband
bring
me
a
towel
the
young
man
cried
to
her
after
he
had
stretched
jenkins
bruised
and
frightened
on
the
ground
she
snatched
off
her
apron
and
ran
down
with
it
and
the
young
man
wrapped
me
in
it
and
taking
me
carefully
in
his
arms
walked
down
the
path
to
the
gate
there
were
some
little
boys
standing
there
watching
him
their
mouths
wide
open
with
astonishment
sonny
he
said
to
the
largest
of
them
if
you
will
come
behind
and
carry
this
dog
i
will
give
you
a
quarter
the
boy
took
me
and
we
set
out
i
was
all
smothered
up
in
a
cloth
and
moaning
with
pain
but
still
i
looked
out
occasionally
to
see
which
way
we
were
going
we
took
the
road
to
the
town
and
stopped
in
front
of
a
house
on
washington
street
the
young
man
leaned
his
bicycle
up
against
the
house
took
a
quarter
from
his
pocket
and
put
it
in
the
boy
hand
and
lifting
me
gently
in
his
arms
went
up
a
lane
leading
to
the
back
of
the
house
there
was
a
small
stable
there
he
went
into
it
put
me
down
on
the
floor
and
uncovered
my
body
some
boys
were
playing
about
the
stable
and
i
heard
them
say
in
horrified
tones
oh
cousin
harry
what
is
the
matter
with
that
dog
hush
he
said
do
make
a
fuss
you
jack
go
down
to
the
kitchen
and
ask
mary
for
a
basin
of
warm
water
and
a
sponge
and
do
let
your
mother
or
laura
hear
you
a
few
minutes
later
the
young
man
had
bathed
my
bleeding
ears
and
tail
and
had
rubbed
something
on
them
that
was
cool
and
pleasant
and
had
bandaged
them
firmly
with
strips
of
cotton
i
felt
much
better
and
was
able
to
look
about
me
i
was
in
a
small
stable
that
was
evidently
not
used
for
a
stable
but
more
for
a
there
were
various
kinds
of
toys
scattered
about
and
a
swing
and
bar
such
as
boys
love
to
twist
about
on
in
two
different
corners
in
a
box
against
the
wall
was
a
guinea
pig
looking
at
me
in
an
interested
way
this
guinea
pig
name
was
jeff
and
he
and
i
became
good
friends
a
french
rabbit
was
hopping
about
and
a
tame
white
rat
was
perched
on
the
shoulder
of
one
of
the
boys
and
kept
his
foothold
there
no
matter
how
suddenly
the
boy
moved
there
were
so
many
boys
and
the
stable
was
so
small
that
i
suppose
he
was
afraid
he
would
get
stepped
on
if
he
went
on
the
floor
he
stared
hard
at
me
with
his
little
red
eyes
and
never
even
glanced
at
a
gray
cat
that
was
watching
me
too
from
her
bed
in
the
back
of
the
vacant
horse
stall
out
in
the
sunny
yard
some
pigeons
were
pecking
at
grain
and
a
spaniel
lay
asleep
in
a
corner
i
had
never
seen
anything
like
this
before
and
my
wonder
at
it
almost
drove
the
pain
away
mother
and
i
always
chased
rats
and
birds
and
once
we
killed
a
kitten
while
i
was
puzzling
over
it
one
of
the
boys
cried
out
here
is
laura
take
that
rag
out
of
the
way
said
harry
kicking
aside
the
old
apron
i
had
been
wrapped
in
and
that
was
stained
with
my
blood
one
of
the
boys
stuffed
it
into
a
barrel
and
then
they
all
looked
toward
the
house
a
young
girl
holding
up
one
hand
to
shade
her
eyes
from
the
sun
was
coming
up
the
walk
that
led
from
the
house
to
the
stable
i
thought
then
that
i
never
had
seen
such
a
beautiful
girl
and
i
think
so
still
she
was
tall
and
slender
and
had
lovely
brown
eyes
and
brown
hair
and
a
sweet
smile
and
just
to
look
at
her
was
enough
to
make
one
love
her
i
stood
in
the
stable
door
staring
at
her
with
all
my
might
why
what
a
funny
dog
she
said
and
stopped
short
to
looked
at
me
up
to
this
i
had
not
thought
what
a
sight
i
must
be
now
i
twisted
round
my
head
saw
the
white
bandage
on
my
tail
and
knowing
i
was
not
a
fit
spectacle
for
a
pretty
young
lady
like
that
i
slunk
into
a
corner
poor
doggie
have
i
hurt
your
feelings
she
said
and
with
a
sweet
smile
at
the
boys
she
passed
by
them
and
came
up
to
the
guinea
box
behind
which
i
had
taken
refuge
what
is
the
matter
with
your
head
good
dog
she
said
curiously
as
she
stooped
over
me
he
has
a
cold
in
it
said
one
of
the
boys
with
a
laugh
so
we
put
a
nightcap
on
she
drew
back
and
turned
very
pale
cousin
harry
there
are
drops
of
blood
on
this
cotton
who
has
hurt
this
dog
dear
laura
and
the
young
man
coming
up
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
he
got
hurt
and
i
have
been
bandaging
him
who
hurt
him
i
had
rather
not
tell
you
but
i
wish
to
know
her
voice
was
as
gentle
as
ever
but
she
spoke
so
decidedly
that
the
young
man
was
obliged
to
tell
her
everything
all
the
time
he
was
speaking
she
kept
touching
me
gently
with
her
fingers
when
he
had
finished
his
account
of
rescuing
me
from
jenkins
she
said
quietly
you
will
have
the
man
punished
what
is
the
use
that
wo
stop
him
from
being
cruel
it
will
put
a
check
on
his
cruelty
i
do
think
it
would
do
any
good
said
the
young
man
doggedly
cousin
harry
and
the
young
girl
stood
up
very
straight
and
tall
her
brown
eyes
flashing
and
one
hand
pointing
at
me
will
you
let
that
pass
that
animal
has
been
wronged
it
looks
to
you
to
right
it
the
coward
who
has
maimed
it
for
life
should
be
punished
a
child
has
a
voice
to
tell
its
wrong
a
poor
dumb
creature
must
suffer
in
silence
in
bitter
bitter
silence
and
eagerly
as
the
young
man
tried
to
interrupt
her
you
are
doing
the
man
himself
an
injustice
if
he
is
bad
enough
to
his
dog
he
will
his
wife
and
children
if
he
is
checked
and
punished
now
for
his
cruelty
he
may
reform
and
even
if
his
wicked
heart
is
not
changed
he
will
be
obliged
to
treat
them
with
outward
kindness
through
fear
of
punishment
the
young
man
looked
convinced
and
almost
as
ashamed
as
if
he
had
been
the
one
to
crop
my
ears
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
he
said
slowly
and
looking
sheepishly
at
the
boys
who
were
staring
at
him
and
the
young
girl
the
girl
pulled
a
little
watch
from
her
belt
i
want
you
to
report
that
man
immediately
it
is
now
five
i
will
go
down
to
the
police
station
with
you
if
you
like
very
well
he
said
his
face
brightening
and
together
they
went
off
to
the
house
chapter
iv
the
morris
boys
add
to
my
name
the
boys
watched
them
out
of
sight
then
one
of
them
whose
name
i
afterward
learned
was
jack
and
who
came
next
to
miss
laura
in
age
gave
a
low
whistle
and
said
does
the
old
lady
come
out
strong
when
any
one
or
anything
gets
abused
i
never
forget
the
day
she
found
me
setting
jim
on
that
black
cat
of
the
wilsons
she
scolded
me
and
then
she
cried
till
i
did
know
where
to
look
plague
on
it
how
was
i
going
to
know
he
kill
the
old
cat
i
only
wanted
to
drive
it
out
of
the
yard
come
on
let
look
at
the
dog
they
all
came
and
bent
over
me
as
i
lay
on
the
floor
in
my
corner
i
was
much
used
to
boys
and
i
did
know
how
they
would
treat
me
but
i
soon
found
by
the
way
they
handled
me
and
talked
to
me
that
they
knew
a
good
deal
about
dogs
and
were
accustomed
to
treat
them
kindly
it
seemed
very
strange
to
have
them
pat
me
and
call
me
good
dog
no
one
had
ever
said
that
to
me
before
he
not
much
of
a
beauty
is
he
said
one
of
the
boys
whom
they
called
tom
not
by
a
long
shot
said
jack
morris
with
a
laugh
not
any
nearer
the
beauty
mark
than
yourself
tom
tom
flew
at
him
and
they
had
a
scuffle
the
other
boys
paid
no
attention
to
them
but
went
on
looking
at
me
one
of
them
a
little
boy
with
eyes
like
miss
laura
said
what
did
cousin
harry
say
the
name
was
joe
answered
another
boy
the
little
chap
that
carried
him
home
told
him
we
might
call
him
joe
then
said
a
lad
with
a
round
fat
face
and
laughing
eyes
i
wondered
very
much
who
this
boy
was
and
later
on
i
found
out
that
he
was
another
of
miss
laura
brothers
and
his
name
was
ned
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
the
morris
boys
i
do
think
laura
would
like
that
said
jack
morris
suddenly
coming
up
behind
him
he
was
very
hot
and
was
breathing
fast
but
his
manner
was
as
cool
as
if
he
had
never
left
the
group
about
me
he
had
beaten
tom
who
was
sitting
on
a
box
ruefully
surveying
a
hole
in
his
jacket
you
see
he
went
on
gaspingly
if
you
call
him
joe
her
ladyship
will
say
that
you
are
wounding
the
dear
dog
feelings
joe
would
be
more
to
her
liking
a
shout
went
up
from
the
boys
i
did
wonder
that
they
laughed
i
naturally
was
but
i
must
have
been
hideous
in
those
bandages
joe
then
let
it
be
they
cried
let
us
go
and
tell
mother
and
ask
her
to
give
us
something
for
our
beauty
to
eat
they
all
trooped
out
of
the
stable
and
i
was
very
sorry
for
when
they
were
with
me
i
did
not
mind
so
much
the
tingling
in
my
ears
and
the
terrible
pain
in
my
back
they
soon
brought
me
some
nice
food
but
i
could
not
touch
it
so
they
went
away
to
their
play
and
i
lay
in
the
box
they
put
me
in
trembling
with
pain
and
wishing
that
the
pretty
young
lady
was
there
to
stroke
me
with
her
gentle
fingers
it
got
dark
the
boys
finished
their
play
and
went
into
the
house
and
i
saw
lights
twinkling
in
the
windows
i
felt
lonely
and
miserable
in
this
strange
place
i
would
not
have
gone
back
to
for
the
world
still
it
was
the
only
home
i
had
known
and
though
i
felt
that
i
should
be
happy
here
i
had
not
yet
gotten
used
to
the
change
then
the
pain
all
through
my
body
was
dreadful
my
head
seemed
to
be
on
fire
and
there
were
sharp
darting
pains
up
and
down
my
backbone
i
did
not
dare
to
howl
lest
i
should
make
the
big
dog
jim
angry
he
was
sleeping
in
a
kennel
out
in
the
yard
the
stable
was
very
quiet
up
in
the
loft
above
some
rabbits
that
i
had
heard
running
about
had
now
gone
to
sleep
the
guinea
pig
was
nestling
in
the
corner
of
his
box
and
the
cat
and
the
tame
rat
had
scampered
into
the
house
long
ago
at
last
i
could
bear
the
pain
no
longer
i
sat
up
in
my
box
and
looked
about
me
i
felt
as
if
i
was
going
to
die
and
though
i
was
very
weak
there
was
something
inside
me
that
made
me
feel
as
if
i
wanted
to
crawl
away
somewhere
out
of
sight
i
slunk
out
into
the
yard
and
along
the
stable
wall
where
there
was
a
thick
clump
of
raspberry
bushes
i
crept
in
among
them
and
lay
down
in
the
damp
earth
i
tried
to
scratch
off
my
bandages
but
they
were
fastened
on
too
firmly
and
i
could
not
do
it
i
thought
about
my
poor
mother
and
wished
she
was
here
to
lick
my
sore
ears
though
she
was
so
unhappy
herself
she
never
wanted
to
see
me
suffer
if
i
had
not
disobeyed
her
i
would
not
now
be
suffering
so
much
pain
she
had
told
me
again
and
again
not
to
snap
at
jenkins
for
it
made
him
worse
in
the
midst
of
my
trouble
i
heard
a
soft
voice
calling
joe
joe
it
was
miss
laura
voice
but
i
felt
as
if
there
were
weights
on
my
paws
and
i
could
not
go
to
her
joe
joe
she
said
again
she
was
going
up
the
walk
to
the
stable
holding
up
a
lighted
lamp
in
her
hand
she
had
on
a
white
dress
and
i
watched
her
till
she
disappeared
in
the
stable
she
did
not
stay
long
in
there
she
came
out
and
stood
on
the
gravel
joe
joe
beautiful
joe
where
are
you
you
are
hiding
somewhere
but
i
shall
find
you
then
she
came
right
to
the
spot
where
i
was
poor
doggie
she
said
stooping
down
and
patting
me
are
you
very
miserable
and
did
you
crawl
away
to
die
i
have
had
dogs
to
do
that
before
but
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
die
joe
and
she
set
her
lamp
on
the
ground
and
took
me
in
her
arms
i
was
very
thin
then
not
nearly
so
fat
as
i
am
now
still
i
was
quite
an
armful
for
her
but
she
did
not
seem
to
find
me
heavy
she
took
me
right
into
the
house
through
the
back
door
and
down
a
long
flight
of
steps
across
a
hall
and
into
a
snug
kitchen
for
the
land
sakes
miss
laura
said
a
woman
who
was
bending
over
a
stove
what
have
you
got
there
a
poor
sick
dog
mary
said
miss
laura
seating
herself
on
a
chair
will
you
please
warm
a
little
milk
for
him
and
have
you
a
box
or
a
basket
down
here
that
he
can
lie
in
i
guess
so
said
the
woman
but
he
awful
dirty
you
not
going
to
let
him
sleep
in
the
house
are
you
only
for
he
is
very
a
dreadful
thing
happened
to
him
mary
and
miss
laura
went
on
to
tell
her
how
my
ears
had
been
cut
off
oh
that
the
dog
the
boys
were
talking
about
said
the
woman
poor
creature
he
welcome
to
all
i
can
do
for
him
she
opened
a
closet
door
and
brought
out
a
box
and
folded
a
piece
of
blanket
for
me
to
lie
on
then
she
heated
some
milk
in
a
saucepan
and
poured
it
in
a
saucer
and
watched
me
while
miss
laura
went
upstairs
to
get
a
little
bottle
of
something
that
would
make
me
sleep
they
poured
a
few
drops
of
this
medicine
into
the
milk
and
offered
it
to
me
i
lapped
a
little
but
i
could
not
finish
it
even
though
miss
laura
coaxed
me
very
gently
to
do
so
she
dipped
her
finger
in
the
milk
and
held
it
out
to
me
and
though
i
did
not
want
it
i
could
not
be
ungrateful
enough
to
refuse
to
lick
her
finger
as
often
as
she
offered
it
to
me
after
the
milk
was
gone
mary
lifted
up
my
box
and
carried
me
into
the
washroom
that
was
off
the
kitchen
i
soon
fell
sound
asleep
and
could
not
rouse
myself
through
the
night
even
though
i
both
smelled
and
heard
some
one
coming
near
me
several
times
the
next
morning
i
found
out
that
it
was
miss
laura
whenever
there
was
a
sick
animal
in
the
house
no
matter
if
it
was
only
the
tame
rat
she
would
get
up
two
or
three
times
in
the
night
to
see
if
there
was
anything
she
could
do
to
make
it
more
comfortable
chapter
v
my
new
home
and
a
selfish
lady
i
do
believe
that
a
dog
could
have
fallen
into
a
happier
home
than
i
did
in
a
week
thanks
to
good
nursing
good
food
and
kind
words
i
was
almost
well
harry
washed
and
dressed
my
sore
ears
and
tail
every
day
till
he
went
home
and
one
day
he
and
the
boys
gave
me
a
bath
out
in
the
stable
they
carried
out
a
tub
of
warm
water
and
stood
me
in
it
i
had
never
been
washed
before
in
my
life
and
it
felt
very
queer
miss
laura
stood
by
laughing
and
encouraging
me
not
to
mind
the
streams
of
water
trickling
all
over
me
i
could
help
wondering
what
jenkins
would
have
said
if
he
could
have
seen
me
in
that
tub
that
reminds
me
to
say
that
two
days
after
i
arrived
at
the
morrises
jack
followed
by
all
the
other
boys
came
running
into
the
stable
he
had
a
newspaper
in
his
hand
and
with
a
great
deal
of
laughing
and
joking
read
this
to
me
daily
news
june
in
the
police
court
this
morning
james
jenkins
for
cruelly
torturing
and
mutilating
a
dog
fined
ten
dollars
and
costs
then
he
said
what
do
you
think
of
that
joe
five
dollars
apiece
for
your
ears
and
your
tail
thrown
in
that
all
they
worth
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
jenkins
has
had
his
fun
and
you
go
through
life
worth
about
of
a
dog
i
lash
rascals
like
that
tie
them
up
and
flog
them
till
they
were
scarred
and
mutilated
a
little
bit
themselves
just
wait
till
i
president
but
there
some
more
old
fellow
listen
reporter
visited
the
house
of
the
jenkins
and
found
a
most
deplorable
state
of
affairs
the
house
yard
and
stable
were
indescribably
filthy
his
horse
bears
the
marks
of
and
is
in
an
emaciated
condition
his
cows
are
plastered
up
with
mud
and
filth
and
are
covered
with
vermin
where
is
our
health
inspector
that
he
does
not
exercise
a
more
watchful
supervision
over
establishments
of
this
kind
to
allow
milk
from
an
unclean
place
like
this
to
be
sold
in
the
town
is
endangering
the
health
of
its
inhabitants
upon
inquiry
it
was
found
that
the
man
jenkins
bears
a
very
bad
character
steps
are
being
taken
to
have
his
wife
and
children
removed
from
him
jack
threw
the
paper
into
my
box
and
he
and
the
other
boys
gave
three
cheers
for
the
news
and
then
ran
away
how
glad
i
was
it
did
not
matter
so
much
for
me
for
i
had
escaped
him
but
now
that
it
had
been
found
out
what
a
cruel
man
he
was
there
would
be
a
restraint
upon
him
and
poor
toby
and
the
cows
would
have
a
happier
time
i
was
going
to
tell
about
the
morris
family
there
were
morris
who
was
a
clergyman
and
preached
in
a
church
in
fairport
morris
his
wife
miss
laura
who
was
the
eldest
of
the
family
then
jack
ned
carl
and
willie
i
think
one
reason
why
they
were
such
a
good
family
was
because
morris
was
such
a
good
woman
she
loved
her
husband
and
children
and
did
everything
she
could
to
make
them
happy
morris
was
a
very
busy
man
and
rarely
interfered
in
household
affairs
morris
was
the
one
who
said
what
was
to
be
done
and
what
was
not
to
be
done
even
then
when
i
was
a
young
dog
i
used
to
think
that
she
was
very
wise
there
was
never
any
noise
or
confusion
in
the
house
and
though
there
was
a
great
deal
of
work
to
be
done
everything
went
on
smoothly
and
pleasantly
and
no
one
ever
got
angry
and
scolded
as
they
did
in
the
jenkins
family
morris
was
very
particular
about
money
matters
whenever
the
boys
came
to
her
for
money
to
get
such
things
as
candy
and
ice
cream
expensive
toys
and
other
things
that
boys
often
crave
she
asked
them
why
they
wanted
them
if
it
was
for
some
selfish
reason
she
said
firmly
no
my
children
we
are
not
rich
people
and
we
must
save
our
money
for
your
education
i
can
not
buy
you
foolish
things
if
they
asked
her
for
money
for
books
or
something
to
make
their
pet
animals
more
comfortable
or
for
their
outdoor
games
she
gave
it
to
them
willingly
her
ideas
about
the
bringing
up
of
children
i
can
not
explain
as
clearly
as
she
can
herself
so
i
will
give
part
of
a
conversation
that
she
had
with
a
lady
who
was
calling
on
her
shortly
after
i
came
to
washington
street
i
happened
to
be
in
the
house
at
the
time
indeed
i
used
to
spend
the
greater
part
of
my
time
in
the
house
jack
one
day
looked
at
me
and
exclaimed
why
does
that
dog
stalk
about
first
after
one
and
then
after
another
looking
at
us
with
such
solemn
eyes
i
wished
that
i
could
speak
to
tell
him
that
i
had
so
long
been
used
to
seeing
animals
kicked
about
and
trodden
upon
that
i
could
not
get
used
to
the
change
it
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
i
could
scarcely
believe
that
dumb
animals
had
rights
but
while
it
lasted
and
human
beings
were
so
kind
to
me
i
wanted
to
be
with
them
all
the
time
miss
laura
understood
she
drew
my
head
up
to
her
lap
and
put
her
face
down
to
me
you
like
to
be
with
us
do
you
joe
stay
in
the
house
as
much
as
you
like
jack
does
mind
though
he
speaks
so
sharply
when
you
get
tired
of
us
go
out
in
the
garden
and
have
a
romp
with
jim
but
i
must
return
to
the
conversation
i
referred
to
it
was
one
fine
june
day
and
morris
was
sewing
in
a
by
the
window
i
was
beside
her
sitting
on
a
hassock
so
that
i
could
look
out
into
the
street
dogs
love
variety
and
excitement
and
like
to
see
what
is
going
on
as
well
as
human
beings
a
carriage
drove
up
to
the
door
and
a
lady
got
out
and
came
up
the
steps
morris
seemed
glad
to
see
her
and
called
her
montague
i
was
pleased
with
her
for
she
had
some
kind
of
perfume
about
her
that
i
liked
to
smell
so
i
went
and
sat
on
the
hearth
rug
quite
near
her
they
had
a
little
talk
about
things
i
did
not
understand
and
then
the
lady
eyes
fell
on
me
she
looked
at
me
through
a
bit
of
glass
that
was
hanging
by
a
chain
from
her
neck
and
pulled
away
her
beautiful
dress
lest
i
should
touch
it
i
did
not
care
any
longer
for
the
perfume
and
went
away
and
sat
very
straight
and
stiff
at
morris
feet
the
lady
eyes
still
followed
me
i
beg
your
pardon
morris
she
said
but
that
is
a
very
dog
you
have
there
yes
said
morris
quietly
he
is
not
a
handsome
dog
and
he
is
a
new
one
is
he
said
montague
yes
and
that
makes
two
dogs
a
cat
fifteen
or
twenty
rabbits
a
rat
about
a
dozen
canaries
and
two
dozen
goldfish
i
do
know
how
many
pigeons
a
few
bantams
a
guinea
pig
and
well
i
do
think
there
is
anything
more
they
both
laughed
and
montague
said
you
have
quite
a
menagerie
my
father
would
never
allow
one
of
his
children
to
keep
a
pet
animal
he
said
it
would
make
his
girls
rough
and
noisy
to
romp
about
the
house
with
cats
and
his
boys
would
look
like
rowdies
if
they
went
about
with
dogs
at
their
heels
i
have
never
found
that
it
made
my
children
more
rough
to
play
with
their
pets
said
morris
no
i
should
think
not
said
the
lady
languidly
your
boys
are
the
most
gentlemanly
lads
in
fairport
and
as
for
laura
she
is
a
perfect
little
lady
i
like
so
much
to
have
them
come
and
see
charlie
they
wake
him
up
and
yet
do
make
him
naughty
they
enjoyed
their
last
visit
very
much
said
morris
by
the
way
i
have
heard
them
talking
about
getting
charlie
a
dog
oh
cried
the
lady
with
a
little
shudder
beg
them
not
to
i
can
not
sanction
that
i
hate
dogs
why
do
you
hate
them
asked
morris
gently
they
are
such
dirty
things
they
always
smell
and
have
vermin
on
them
a
dog
said
morris
is
something
like
a
child
if
you
want
it
clean
and
pleasant
you
have
got
to
keep
it
so
this
dog
skin
is
as
clean
as
yours
or
mine
hold
still
joe
and
she
brushed
the
hair
on
my
back
the
wrong
way
and
showed
montague
how
pink
and
free
from
dust
my
skin
was
montague
looked
at
me
more
kindly
and
even
held
out
the
tips
of
her
fingers
to
me
i
did
not
lick
them
i
only
smelled
them
and
she
drew
her
hand
back
again
you
have
never
been
brought
in
contact
with
the
lower
creation
as
i
have
said
morris
just
let
me
tell
you
in
a
few
words
what
a
help
dumb
animals
have
been
to
me
in
the
of
my
children
my
boys
especially
when
i
was
a
young
married
woman
going
about
the
slums
of
new
york
with
my
husband
i
used
to
come
home
and
look
at
my
two
babies
as
they
lay
in
their
little
cots
and
say
to
him
are
we
going
to
do
to
keep
these
children
from
selfishness
the
curse
of
the
world
them
to
do
something
for
somebody
outside
themselves
he
always
said
and
i
have
tried
to
act
on
that
principle
laura
is
naturally
unselfish
with
her
tiny
baby
fingers
she
would
take
food
from
her
own
mouth
and
put
it
into
jack
if
we
did
not
watch
her
i
have
never
had
any
trouble
with
her
but
the
boys
were
born
selfish
tiresomely
disgustingly
selfish
they
were
good
boys
in
many
ways
as
they
grew
older
they
were
respectful
obedient
they
were
not
untidy
and
not
particularly
rough
but
their
one
thought
was
for
themselves
each
one
for
himself
and
they
used
to
quarrel
with
each
other
in
regard
to
their
rights
while
we
were
in
new
york
we
had
only
a
small
back
yard
when
we
came
here
i
said
am
going
to
try
an
experiment
we
got
this
house
because
it
had
a
large
garden
and
a
stable
that
would
do
for
the
boys
to
play
in
then
i
got
them
together
and
had
a
little
serious
talk
i
said
i
was
not
pleased
with
the
way
in
which
they
were
living
they
did
nothing
for
any
one
but
themselves
from
morning
to
night
if
i
asked
them
to
do
an
errand
for
me
it
was
done
unwillingly
of
course
i
knew
they
had
their
school
for
a
part
of
the
day
but
they
had
a
good
deal
of
leisure
time
when
they
might
do
something
for
some
one
else
i
asked
them
if
they
thought
they
were
going
to
make
real
manly
christian
boys
at
this
rate
and
they
said
no
then
i
asked
them
what
we
should
do
about
it
they
all
said
tell
us
mother
and
we
do
as
you
say
i
proposed
a
series
of
tasks
each
one
to
do
something
for
somebody
outside
and
apart
from
himself
every
day
of
his
life
they
all
agreed
to
this
and
told
me
to
allot
the
tasks
if
i
could
have
afforded
it
i
would
have
gotten
a
horse
and
cow
and
had
them
take
charge
of
them
but
i
could
not
do
that
so
i
invested
in
a
pair
of
rabbits
for
jack
a
pair
of
canaries
for
carl
pigeons
for
ned
and
bantams
for
willie
i
brought
these
creatures
home
put
them
into
their
hands
and
told
them
to
provide
for
them
they
were
delighted
with
my
choice
and
it
was
very
amusing
to
see
them
scurrying
about
to
provide
food
and
shelter
for
their
pets
and
hear
their
consultations
with
other
boys
the
end
of
it
all
is
that
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
with
my
experiment
my
boys
in
caring
for
these
dumb
creatures
have
become
unselfish
and
thoughtful
they
had
rather
go
to
school
without
their
own
breakfast
than
have
the
inmates
of
the
stable
go
hungry
they
are
getting
a
humane
education
a
heart
education
added
to
the
intellectual
education
of
their
schools
then
it
keeps
them
at
home
i
used
to
be
worried
with
the
lingering
about
street
corners
the
dawdling
around
with
other
boys
and
the
idle
often
worse
than
idle
talk
indulged
in
now
they
have
something
to
do
they
are
men
of
business
they
are
always
hammering
and
pounding
at
boxes
and
partitions
out
there
in
the
stable
or
cleaning
up
and
if
they
are
sent
out
on
an
errand
they
do
it
and
come
right
home
i
do
mean
to
say
that
we
have
deprived
them
of
liberty
they
have
their
days
for
and
and
excursions
to
the
woods
but
they
have
so
much
to
do
at
home
that
they
wo
go
away
unless
for
a
specific
purpose
while
morris
was
talking
her
visitor
leaned
forward
in
her
chair
and
listened
attentively
when
she
finished
montague
said
quietly
thank
you
i
am
glad
that
you
told
me
this
i
shall
get
charlie
a
dog
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
replied
morris
it
will
be
a
good
thing
for
your
little
boy
i
should
not
wish
my
boys
to
be
without
a
good
faithful
dog
a
child
can
learn
many
a
lesson
from
a
dog
this
one
pointing
to
me
might
be
held
up
as
an
example
to
many
a
human
being
he
is
patient
quiet
and
obedient
my
husband
says
that
he
reminds
him
of
three
words
in
the
bible
much
tribulation
why
does
he
say
that
asked
montague
curiously
because
he
came
to
us
from
a
very
unhappy
home
and
morris
went
on
to
tell
her
friend
what
she
knew
of
my
early
days
when
she
stopped
montague
face
was
shocked
and
pained
how
dreadful
to
think
that
there
are
such
creatures
as
that
man
jenkins
in
the
world
and
you
say
that
he
has
a
wife
and
children
morris
tell
me
plainly
are
there
many
such
unhappy
homes
in
fairport
morris
hesitated
for
a
minute
then
she
said
earnestly
my
dear
friend
if
you
could
see
all
the
wickedness
and
cruelty
and
vileness
that
is
practised
in
this
little
town
of
ours
in
one
night
you
could
not
rest
in
your
bed
montague
looked
dazed
i
did
not
dream
that
it
was
as
bad
as
that
she
said
are
we
worse
than
other
towns
no
not
worse
but
bad
enough
over
and
over
again
the
saying
is
true
the
world
does
not
know
how
the
other
half
lives
how
can
all
this
misery
touch
you
you
live
in
your
lovely
house
out
of
the
town
when
you
come
in
you
drive
about
do
your
shopping
make
calls
and
go
home
again
you
never
visit
the
poorer
streets
the
people
from
them
never
come
to
you
you
are
rich
your
people
before
you
were
rich
you
live
in
a
state
of
isolation
but
that
is
not
right
said
the
lady
in
a
wailing
voice
i
have
been
thinking
about
this
matter
lately
i
read
a
great
deal
in
the
papers
about
the
misery
of
the
lower
classes
and
i
think
we
richer
ones
ought
to
do
something
to
help
them
morris
what
can
i
do
the
tears
came
in
morris
eyes
she
looked
at
the
little
frail
lady
and
said
simply
dear
montague
i
think
the
root
of
the
whole
matter
lies
in
this
the
lord
made
us
all
one
family
we
are
all
brothers
and
sisters
the
lowest
woman
is
your
sister
and
my
sister
the
man
lying
in
the
gutter
is
our
brother
what
should
we
do
to
help
these
members
of
our
common
family
who
are
not
as
well
off
as
we
are
we
should
share
our
last
crust
with
them
you
and
i
but
for
god
grace
in
placing
us
in
different
surroundings
might
be
in
their
places
i
think
it
is
wicked
neglect
criminal
neglect
in
us
to
ignore
this
fact
it
is
it
is
said
montague
in
a
despairing
voice
i
ca
help
feeling
it
tell
me
something
i
can
do
to
help
some
one
morris
sank
back
in
her
chair
her
face
very
sad
and
yet
with
something
like
pleasure
in
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
her
caller
your
washerwoman
she
said
has
a
drunken
husband
and
a
cripple
boy
i
have
often
seen
her
standing
over
her
tub
washing
your
delicate
muslins
and
laces
and
dropping
tears
into
the
water
i
will
never
send
her
anything
more
she
shall
not
be
troubled
said
montague
hastily
morris
could
not
help
smiling
i
have
not
made
myself
clear
it
is
not
the
washing
that
troubles
her
it
is
her
husband
who
beats
her
and
her
boy
who
worries
her
if
you
and
i
take
our
work
from
her
she
will
have
that
much
less
money
to
depend
upon
and
will
suffer
in
consequence
she
is
a
and
capable
woman
and
makes
a
fair
living
i
would
not
advise
you
to
give
her
money
for
her
husband
would
find
it
out
and
take
it
from
her
it
is
sympathy
that
she
wants
if
you
could
visit
her
occasionally
and
show
that
you
are
interested
in
her
by
talking
or
reading
to
her
poor
foolish
boy
or
showing
him
a
you
have
no
idea
how
grateful
she
would
be
to
you
and
how
it
would
cheer
her
on
her
dreary
way
i
will
go
to
see
her
said
montague
can
you
think
of
any
one
else
i
could
visit
a
great
many
said
morris
but
i
do
think
you
had
better
undertake
too
much
at
once
i
will
give
you
the
addresses
of
three
or
four
poor
families
where
an
occasional
visit
would
do
untold
good
that
is
it
will
do
them
good
if
you
treat
them
as
you
do
your
richer
friends
do
give
them
too
much
money
or
too
many
presents
till
you
find
out
what
they
need
try
to
feel
interested
in
them
find
out
their
ways
of
living
and
what
they
are
going
to
do
with
their
children
and
help
them
to
get
situations
for
them
if
you
can
and
be
sure
to
remember
that
poverty
does
not
always
take
away
one
i
will
i
will
said
montague
eagerly
when
can
you
give
me
these
addresses
morris
smiled
again
and
taking
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
pencil
from
her
work
basket
wrote
a
few
lines
and
handed
them
to
montague
the
lady
got
up
to
take
her
leave
and
in
regard
to
the
dog
said
morris
following
her
to
the
door
if
you
decide
to
allow
charlie
to
have
one
you
had
better
let
him
come
in
and
have
a
talk
with
my
boys
about
it
they
seem
to
know
all
the
dogs
that
are
for
sale
in
the
town
thank
you
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
do
so
he
shall
have
his
dog
when
can
you
have
him
the
next
day
any
day
at
all
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
let
him
spend
an
afternoon
and
evening
with
the
boys
if
you
do
not
object
it
will
give
me
much
pleasure
and
the
little
lady
bowed
and
smiled
and
after
stooping
down
to
pat
me
tripped
down
the
steps
and
got
into
her
carriage
and
drove
away
morris
stood
looking
after
her
with
a
beaming
face
and
i
began
to
think
that
i
should
like
montague
too
if
i
knew
her
long
enough
two
days
later
i
was
quite
sure
i
should
for
i
had
a
proof
that
she
really
liked
me
when
her
little
boy
charlie
came
to
the
house
he
brought
something
for
me
done
up
in
white
paper
morris
opened
it
and
there
was
a
handsome
collar
with
my
name
on
it
beautiful
joe
was
i
pleased
they
took
off
the
little
shabby
leather
strap
that
the
boys
had
given
me
when
i
came
and
fastened
on
my
new
collar
and
then
morris
held
me
up
to
a
glass
to
look
at
myself
i
felt
so
happy
up
to
this
time
i
had
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
my
cropped
ears
and
docked
tail
but
now
that
i
had
a
fine
new
collar
i
could
hold
up
my
head
with
any
dog
dear
old
joe
said
morris
pressing
my
head
tightly
between
her
hands
you
did
a
good
thing
the
other
day
in
helping
me
to
start
that
little
woman
out
of
her
selfish
way
of
living
i
did
not
know
about
that
but
i
knew
that
i
felt
very
grateful
to
montague
for
my
new
collar
and
ever
afterward
when
i
met
her
in
the
street
i
stopped
and
looked
at
her
sometimes
she
saw
me
and
stopped
her
carriage
to
speak
to
me
but
i
always
wagged
my
tail
or
rather
my
body
for
i
had
no
tail
to
wag
whenever
i
saw
her
whether
she
saw
me
or
not
her
son
got
a
beautiful
irish
setter
called
brisk
he
had
a
silky
coat
and
soft
brown
eyes
and
his
young
master
seemed
very
fond
of
him
chapter
vi
the
fox
terrier
billy
when
i
came
to
the
morrises
i
knew
nothing
about
the
proper
way
of
bringing
up
a
puppy
i
once
heard
of
a
little
boy
whose
sister
beat
him
so
much
that
he
said
he
was
brought
up
by
hand
so
i
think
as
jenkins
kicked
me
so
much
i
may
say
that
i
was
brought
up
by
foot
shortly
after
my
arrival
in
my
new
home
i
had
a
chance
of
seeing
how
one
should
bring
up
a
little
puppy
one
day
i
was
sitting
beside
miss
laura
in
the
parlor
when
the
door
opened
and
jack
came
in
one
of
his
hands
was
laid
over
the
other
and
he
said
to
his
sister
guess
what
i
got
here
a
bird
she
said
no
a
rat
no
a
mouse
no
a
pup
oh
jack
she
said
reprovingly
for
she
thought
he
was
telling
a
story
he
opened
his
hands
and
there
lay
the
tiniest
morsel
of
a
fox
terrier
puppy
that
i
ever
saw
he
was
white
with
black
and
tan
markings
his
body
was
pure
white
his
tail
black
with
a
dash
of
tan
his
ears
black
and
his
face
evenly
marked
with
black
and
tan
we
could
not
tell
the
color
of
his
eyes
as
they
were
not
open
later
on
they
turned
out
to
be
a
pretty
brown
his
nose
was
pale
pink
and
when
he
got
older
it
became
jet
black
why
jack
exclaimed
miss
laura
his
eyes
are
open
why
did
you
take
him
from
his
mother
she
dead
said
jack
poisoned
left
her
pups
to
run
about
the
yard
for
a
little
exercise
some
brute
had
thrown
over
a
piece
of
poisoned
meat
and
she
ate
it
four
of
the
pups
died
this
is
the
only
one
left
robinson
says
his
man
does
understand
raising
pups
without
their
mothers
and
as
he
is
going
away
he
wants
us
to
have
it
for
we
always
had
such
luck
in
nursing
sick
animals
robinson
i
knew
was
a
friend
of
the
morrises
and
a
gentleman
who
was
fond
of
fancy
stock
and
imported
a
great
deal
of
it
from
england
if
this
puppy
came
from
him
it
was
sure
to
be
good
one
miss
laura
took
the
tiny
creature
and
went
upstairs
very
thoughtfully
i
followed
her
and
watched
her
get
a
little
basket
and
line
it
with
cotton
wool
she
put
the
puppy
in
it
and
looked
at
him
though
it
was
midsummer
and
the
house
seemed
very
warm
to
me
the
little
creature
was
shivering
and
making
a
low
murmuring
noise
she
pulled
the
wool
all
over
him
and
put
the
window
down
and
set
his
basket
in
the
sun
then
she
went
to
the
kitchen
and
got
some
warm
milk
she
dipped
her
finger
in
it
and
offered
it
to
the
puppy
but
he
went
nosing
about
it
in
a
stupid
way
and
would
touch
it
too
young
miss
laura
said
she
got
a
little
piece
of
muslin
put
some
bread
in
it
tied
a
string
round
it
and
dipped
it
in
the
milk
when
she
put
this
to
the
puppy
mouth
he
sucked
it
greedily
he
acted
as
if
he
was
starving
but
miss
laura
only
let
him
have
a
little
every
few
hours
for
the
rest
of
the
day
she
gave
him
some
more
milk
and
i
heard
the
boys
say
that
for
many
nights
she
got
up
once
or
twice
and
heated
milk
over
a
lamp
for
him
one
night
the
milk
got
cold
before
he
took
it
and
he
swelled
up
and
became
so
ill
that
miss
laura
had
to
rouse
her
mother
and
get
some
hot
water
to
plunge
him
in
that
made
him
well
again
and
no
one
seemed
to
think
it
was
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
take
for
a
creature
that
was
nothing
but
a
dog
he
fully
repaid
them
for
all
his
care
for
he
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
prettiest
and
most
lovable
dogs
that
i
ever
saw
they
called
him
billy
and
the
two
events
of
his
early
life
were
the
opening
of
his
eyes
and
the
swallowing
of
his
muslin
rag
the
rag
did
not
seem
to
hurt
him
but
miss
laura
said
that
as
he
had
got
so
strong
and
so
greedy
he
must
learn
to
eat
like
other
dogs
he
was
very
amusing
when
he
was
a
puppy
he
was
full
of
tricks
and
he
crept
about
in
a
mischievous
way
when
one
did
not
know
he
was
near
he
was
a
very
small
puppy
and
used
to
climb
inside
miss
laura
jersey
sleeve
up
to
her
shoulder
when
he
was
six
weeks
old
one
day
when
the
whole
family
was
in
the
parlor
morris
suddenly
flung
aside
his
newspaper
and
began
jumping
up
and
down
morris
was
very
much
alarmed
and
cried
out
my
dear
william
what
is
the
matter
there
a
rat
up
my
leg
he
said
shaking
it
violently
just
then
little
billy
fell
out
on
the
floor
and
lay
on
his
back
looking
up
at
morris
with
a
surprised
face
he
had
felt
cold
and
thought
it
would
be
warm
inside
morris
trouser
leg
however
billy
never
did
any
real
mischief
thanks
to
miss
training
she
began
to
punish
him
just
as
soon
as
he
began
to
tear
and
worry
things
the
first
thing
he
attacked
was
morris
felt
hat
the
wind
blew
it
down
the
hall
one
day
and
billy
came
along
and
began
to
try
it
with
his
teeth
i
dare
say
it
felt
good
to
them
for
a
puppy
is
very
like
a
baby
and
loves
something
to
bite
miss
laura
found
him
and
he
rolled
his
eyes
at
her
quite
innocently
not
knowing
that
he
was
doing
wrong
she
took
the
hat
away
and
pointing
from
it
to
him
said
bad
billy
then
she
gave
him
two
or
three
slaps
with
a
bootlace
she
never
struck
a
little
dog
with
her
hand
or
a
stick
she
said
clubs
were
for
big
dogs
and
switches
for
little
dogs
if
one
had
to
use
them
the
best
way
was
to
scold
them
for
a
good
dog
feels
a
severe
scolding
as
much
as
a
whipping
billy
was
very
much
ashamed
of
himself
nothing
would
induce
him
even
to
look
at
a
hat
again
but
he
thought
it
was
no
harm
to
worry
other
things
he
attacked
one
thing
after
another
the
rugs
on
the
floor
curtains
anything
flying
or
fluttering
and
miss
laura
patiently
scolded
him
for
each
one
till
at
last
it
dawned
upon
him
that
he
must
not
worry
anything
but
a
bone
then
he
got
to
be
a
very
good
dog
there
was
one
thing
that
miss
laura
was
very
particular
about
and
that
was
to
have
him
fed
regularly
we
both
got
three
meals
a
day
we
were
never
allowed
to
go
into
the
dining
room
and
while
the
family
was
at
the
table
we
lay
in
the
hall
outside
and
watched
what
was
going
on
dogs
take
a
great
interest
in
what
any
one
gets
to
eat
it
was
quite
exciting
to
see
the
morrises
passing
each
other
different
dishes
and
to
smell
the
nice
hot
food
billy
often
wished
that
he
could
get
up
on
the
table
he
said
that
he
would
make
things
fly
when
he
was
growing
he
hardly
ever
got
enough
to
eat
i
used
to
tell
him
that
he
would
kill
himself
if
he
could
eat
all
he
wanted
to
as
soon
as
meals
were
over
billy
and
i
scampered
after
miss
laura
to
the
kitchen
we
each
had
our
own
plate
for
food
mary
the
cook
often
laughed
at
miss
laura
because
she
would
not
let
her
dogs
dish
together
miss
laura
said
that
if
she
did
the
larger
one
would
get
more
than
his
share
and
the
little
one
would
starve
it
was
quite
a
sight
to
see
billy
eat
he
spread
his
legs
apart
to
steady
himself
and
gobbled
at
his
food
like
a
duck
when
he
finished
he
always
looked
up
for
more
and
miss
laura
would
shake
her
head
and
say
no
billy
better
longing
than
loathing
i
believe
that
a
great
many
little
dogs
are
killed
by
over
feeding
i
often
heard
the
morrises
speak
of
the
foolish
way
in
which
some
people
stuffed
their
pets
with
food
and
either
kill
them
by
it
or
keep
them
in
continual
ill
health
a
case
occurred
in
our
neighborhood
while
billy
was
a
puppy
some
people
called
dobson
who
lived
only
a
few
doors
from
the
morrises
had
a
fine
bay
mare
and
a
little
colt
called
sam
they
were
very
proud
of
this
colt
and
dobson
had
promised
it
to
his
son
james
one
day
dobson
asked
morris
to
come
in
and
see
the
colt
and
i
went
too
i
watched
morris
while
he
examined
it
it
was
a
pretty
little
creature
and
i
did
not
wonder
that
they
thought
so
much
of
it
when
morris
went
home
his
wife
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
it
i
think
he
said
that
it
wo
live
long
why
papa
exclaimed
jack
who
overheard
the
remark
it
is
as
fat
as
a
seal
it
would
have
a
better
chance
for
its
life
if
it
were
lean
and
scrawny
said
morris
they
are
it
and
i
told
dobson
so
but
he
was
inclined
to
believe
me
now
morris
had
been
brought
up
in
the
country
and
knew
a
great
deal
about
animals
so
i
was
inclined
to
think
he
was
right
and
sure
enough
in
a
few
days
we
heard
that
the
colt
was
dead
poor
james
dobson
felt
very
badly
a
number
of
the
neighbors
boys
went
into
see
him
and
there
he
stood
gazing
at
the
dead
colt
and
looking
as
if
he
wanted
to
cry
jack
was
there
and
i
was
at
his
heels
and
though
he
said
nothing
for
a
time
i
knew
he
was
angry
with
the
dobsons
for
sacrificing
the
colt
life
presently
he
said
you
wo
need
to
have
that
colt
stuffed
now
he
dead
dobson
what
do
you
mean
why
do
you
say
that
asked
the
boy
peevishly
because
you
stuffed
him
while
he
was
alive
said
jack
saucily
then
we
had
to
run
for
all
we
were
worth
for
the
dobson
boy
was
after
us
and
as
he
was
a
big
fellow
he
would
have
whipped
jack
soundly
i
must
not
forget
to
say
that
billy
was
washed
regularly
once
a
week
with
soap
and
once
a
month
with
disagreeable
carbolic
soap
he
had
his
own
towels
and
wash
cloths
and
after
being
rubbed
and
scrubbed
he
was
rolled
in
a
blanket
and
put
by
the
fire
to
dry
miss
laura
said
that
a
little
dog
that
has
been
petted
and
kept
in
the
house
and
has
become
tender
should
never
be
washed
and
allowed
to
run
about
with
a
wet
coat
unless
the
weather
was
very
warm
for
he
would
be
sure
to
take
cold
jim
and
i
were
more
hardy
than
billy
and
we
took
our
baths
in
the
sea
every
few
days
the
boys
took
us
down
to
the
shore
and
we
went
in
swimming
with
them
chapter
vii
training
a
puppy
ned
dear
said
miss
laura
one
day
i
wish
you
would
train
billy
to
follow
and
retrieve
he
is
four
months
old
now
and
i
shall
soon
want
to
take
him
out
in
the
street
very
well
sister
said
mischievous
ned
and
catching
up
a
stick
he
said
come
out
into
the
garden
dogs
though
he
was
brandishing
his
stick
very
fiercely
i
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
him
and
as
for
billy
he
loved
ned
the
morris
garden
was
really
not
a
garden
but
a
large
piece
of
ground
with
the
grass
worn
bare
in
many
places
a
few
trees
scattered
about
and
some
raspberry
and
currant
bushes
along
the
fence
a
lady
who
knew
that
morris
had
not
a
large
salary
said
one
day
when
she
was
looking
out
of
the
window
my
dear
morris
why
you
have
this
garden
dug
up
you
could
raise
your
own
vegetables
it
would
be
so
much
cheaper
than
buying
them
morris
laughed
in
great
amusement
think
of
the
hens
and
cats
and
dogs
and
rabbits
and
above
all
the
boys
that
i
have
what
sort
of
a
garden
would
there
be
and
do
you
think
it
would
be
fair
to
take
their
playground
from
them
the
lady
said
no
she
did
not
think
it
would
be
fair
i
am
sure
i
do
know
what
the
boys
would
have
done
without
this
strip
of
ground
many
a
frolic
and
game
they
had
there
in
the
present
case
ned
walked
around
and
around
it
with
his
stick
on
his
shoulder
billy
and
i
strolling
after
him
presently
billy
made
a
dash
aside
to
get
a
bone
ned
turned
around
and
said
firmly
to
heel
billy
looked
at
him
innocently
not
knowing
what
he
meant
to
heel
exclaimed
ned
again
billy
thought
he
wanted
to
play
and
putting
his
head
on
his
paws
he
began
to
bark
ned
laughed
still
he
kept
saying
to
heel
he
would
not
say
another
word
he
knew
if
he
said
come
here
or
follow
or
go
behind
it
would
confuse
billy
finally
as
ned
kept
saying
the
words
over
and
over
and
pointing
to
me
it
seemed
to
dawn
upon
billy
that
he
wanted
him
to
follow
him
so
he
came
beside
me
and
together
we
followed
ned
around
the
garden
again
and
again
ned
often
looked
behind
with
a
pleased
face
and
i
felt
so
proud
to
think
i
was
doing
well
but
suddenly
i
got
dreadfully
confused
when
he
turned
around
and
said
hie
out
the
morrises
all
used
the
same
words
in
training
their
dogs
and
i
had
heard
miss
laura
say
this
but
i
had
forgotten
what
it
meant
good
joe
said
ned
turning
around
and
patting
me
you
have
forgotten
i
wonder
where
jim
is
he
would
help
us
he
put
his
fingers
in
his
mouth
and
blew
a
shrill
whistle
and
soon
jim
came
trotting
up
the
lane
from
the
street
he
looked
at
us
with
his
large
intelligent
eyes
and
wagged
his
tail
slowly
as
if
to
say
well
what
do
you
want
of
me
come
and
give
me
a
hand
at
this
training
business
old
sobersides
said
ned
with
a
laugh
it
too
slow
to
do
it
alone
now
young
gentlemen
attention
to
heel
he
began
to
march
around
the
garden
again
and
jim
and
i
followed
closely
at
his
heels
while
little
billy
seeing
that
he
could
not
get
us
to
play
with
him
came
lagging
behind
soon
ned
turned
around
and
said
hie
out
old
jim
sprang
ahead
and
ran
off
in
front
as
if
he
was
after
something
now
i
remembered
what
hie
out
meant
we
were
to
have
a
lovely
race
wherever
we
liked
little
billy
loved
this
we
ran
and
scampered
hither
and
thither
and
ned
watched
us
laughing
at
our
antics
after
tea
he
called
us
out
in
the
garden
again
and
said
he
had
something
else
to
teach
us
he
turned
up
a
tub
on
the
wooden
platform
at
the
back
door
and
sat
on
it
and
then
called
jim
to
him
he
took
a
small
leather
strap
from
his
pocket
it
had
a
nice
strong
smell
we
all
licked
it
and
each
dog
wished
to
have
it
no
joe
and
billy
said
ned
holding
us
both
by
our
collars
you
wait
a
minute
here
jim
jim
watched
him
very
earnestly
and
ned
threw
the
strap
across
the
garden
and
said
fetch
it
jim
never
moved
till
he
heard
the
words
fetch
it
then
he
ran
swiftly
brought
the
strap
and
dropped
it
in
ned
hand
ned
sent
him
after
it
two
or
three
times
then
he
said
to
jim
lie
down
and
turned
to
me
here
joe
it
is
your
turn
he
threw
the
strap
under
the
raspberry
bushes
then
looked
at
me
and
said
fetch
it
i
knew
quite
well
what
he
meant
and
ran
joyfully
after
it
i
soon
found
it
by
the
strong
smell
but
the
queerest
thing
happened
when
i
got
it
in
my
mouth
i
began
to
gnaw
it
and
play
with
it
and
when
ned
called
out
fetch
it
i
dropped
it
and
ran
toward
him
i
was
not
obstinate
but
i
was
stupid
ned
pointed
to
the
place
where
it
was
and
spread
out
his
empty
hands
that
helped
me
and
i
ran
quickly
and
got
it
he
made
me
get
it
for
him
several
times
sometimes
i
could
not
find
it
and
sometimes
i
dropped
it
but
he
never
stirred
he
sat
still
till
i
brought
it
to
him
after
a
while
he
tried
billy
but
it
soon
got
dark
and
we
could
not
see
so
he
took
billy
and
went
into
the
house
i
stayed
out
with
jim
for
a
while
and
he
asked
me
if
i
knew
why
ned
had
thrown
a
strap
for
us
instead
of
a
bone
or
something
hard
of
course
i
did
not
know
so
jim
told
me
it
was
on
his
account
he
was
a
bird
dog
and
was
never
allowed
to
carry
anything
hard
in
his
mouth
because
it
would
make
him
and
he
would
be
apt
to
bite
the
birds
when
he
was
bringing
them
back
to
any
person
who
was
shooting
with
him
he
said
that
he
had
been
so
carefully
trained
that
he
could
even
carry
three
eggs
at
a
time
in
his
mouth
i
said
to
him
jim
how
is
it
that
you
never
go
out
shooting
i
have
always
heard
that
you
were
a
dog
for
that
and
yet
you
never
leave
home
he
hung
his
head
a
little
and
said
he
did
not
wish
to
go
and
then
for
he
was
an
honest
dog
he
gave
me
the
true
reason
chapter
viii
a
ruined
dog
i
was
a
sporting
dog
he
said
bitterly
for
the
first
three
years
of
my
life
i
belonged
to
a
man
who
keeps
a
livery
stable
here
in
fairport
and
he
used
to
hire
me
out
to
shooting
parties
i
was
a
favorite
with
all
the
gentlemen
i
was
crazy
with
delight
when
i
saw
the
guns
brought
out
and
would
jump
up
and
bite
at
them
i
loved
to
chase
birds
and
rabbits
and
even
now
when
the
pigeons
come
near
me
i
tremble
all
over
and
have
to
turn
away
lest
i
should
seize
them
i
used
often
to
be
in
the
woods
from
morning
till
night
i
liked
to
have
a
hard
search
after
a
bird
after
it
had
been
shot
and
to
be
praised
for
bringing
it
out
without
biting
or
injuring
it
i
never
got
lost
for
i
am
one
of
those
dogs
that
can
always
tell
where
human
beings
are
i
did
not
smell
them
i
would
be
too
far
away
for
that
but
if
my
master
was
standing
in
some
place
and
i
took
a
long
round
through
the
woods
i
knew
exactly
where
he
was
and
could
make
a
short
cut
back
to
him
without
returning
in
my
tracks
but
i
must
tell
you
about
my
trouble
one
saturday
afternoon
a
party
of
young
men
came
to
get
me
they
had
a
dog
with
them
a
cocker
spaniel
called
bob
but
they
wanted
another
for
some
reason
or
other
my
master
was
very
unwilling
to
have
me
go
however
he
at
last
consented
and
they
put
me
in
the
back
of
the
wagon
with
bob
and
the
lunch
baskets
and
we
drove
off
into
the
country
this
bob
was
a
happy
dog
and
as
we
went
along
he
told
me
of
the
fine
time
we
should
have
next
day
the
young
men
would
shoot
a
little
then
they
would
get
out
their
baskets
and
have
something
to
eat
and
drink
and
would
play
cards
and
go
to
sleep
under
the
trees
and
we
would
be
able
to
help
ourselves
to
legs
and
wings
of
chickens
and
anything
we
liked
from
the
baskets
i
did
not
like
this
at
all
i
was
used
to
working
hard
through
the
week
and
i
liked
to
spend
my
sundays
quietly
at
home
however
i
said
nothing
that
night
we
slept
at
a
country
hotel
and
drove
the
next
morning
to
the
banks
of
a
small
lake
where
the
young
men
were
told
there
would
be
plenty
of
wild
ducks
they
were
in
no
hurry
to
begin
their
sport
they
sat
down
in
the
sun
on
some
flat
rocks
at
the
water
edge
and
said
they
would
have
something
to
drink
before
setting
to
work
they
got
out
some
of
the
bottles
from
the
wagon
and
began
to
take
long
drinks
from
them
then
they
got
quarrelsome
and
mischievous
and
seemed
to
forget
all
about
their
shooting
one
of
them
proposed
to
have
some
fun
with
the
dogs
they
tied
us
both
to
a
tree
and
throwing
a
stick
in
the
water
told
us
to
get
it
of
course
we
struggled
and
tried
to
get
free
and
chafed
our
necks
with
the
rope
after
a
time
one
of
them
began
to
swear
at
me
and
say
that
he
believed
i
was
he
staggered
to
the
wagon
and
got
out
his
fowling
piece
and
said
he
was
going
to
try
me
he
loaded
it
went
to
a
little
distance
and
was
going
to
fire
when
the
young
man
who
owned
bob
said
he
was
going
to
have
his
dog
legs
shot
off
and
coming
up
he
unfastened
him
and
took
him
away
you
can
imagine
my
feelings
as
i
stood
there
tied
to
the
tree
with
that
stranger
pointing
his
gun
directly
at
me
he
fired
close
to
me
a
number
of
times
over
my
head
and
under
my
body
the
earth
was
cut
up
all
around
me
i
was
terribly
frightened
and
howled
and
begged
to
be
freed
the
other
young
men
who
were
sitting
laughing
at
me
thought
it
such
good
fun
that
they
got
their
guns
too
i
never
wish
to
spend
such
a
terrible
hour
again
i
was
sure
they
would
kill
me
i
dare
say
they
would
have
done
so
for
they
were
all
quite
drunk
by
this
time
if
something
had
not
happened
poor
bob
who
was
almost
as
frightened
as
i
was
and
who
lay
shivering
under
the
wagon
was
killed
by
a
shot
by
his
own
master
whose
hand
was
the
most
unsteady
of
all
he
gave
one
loud
howl
kicked
convulsively
then
turned
over
on
his
side
and
lay
quite
still
it
sobered
them
all
they
ran
up
to
him
but
he
was
quite
dead
they
sat
for
a
while
quite
silent
then
they
threw
the
rest
of
the
bottles
into
the
lake
dug
a
shallow
grave
for
bob
and
putting
me
in
the
wagon
drove
slowly
back
to
town
they
were
not
bad
young
men
i
do
think
they
meant
to
hurt
me
or
to
kill
bob
it
was
the
nasty
stuff
in
the
bottles
that
took
away
their
reason
i
was
never
the
same
dog
again
i
was
quite
deaf
in
my
right
ear
and
though
i
strove
against
it
i
was
so
terribly
afraid
of
even
the
sight
of
a
gun
that
i
would
run
and
hide
myself
whenever
one
was
shown
to
me
my
master
was
very
angry
with
those
young
men
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
me
one
day
he
took
me
very
kindly
and
brought
me
here
and
asked
morris
if
he
did
not
want
a
dog
to
play
with
the
children
i
have
a
happy
home
here
and
i
love
the
morris
boys
but
i
often
wish
that
i
could
keep
from
putting
my
tail
between
my
legs
and
running
home
every
time
i
hear
the
sound
of
a
gun
never
mind
that
jim
i
said
you
should
not
fret
over
a
thing
for
which
you
are
not
to
blame
i
am
sure
you
must
be
glad
for
one
reason
that
you
have
left
your
old
life
what
is
that
he
said
on
account
of
the
birds
you
know
miss
laura
thinks
it
is
wrong
to
kill
the
pretty
creatures
that
fly
about
the
woods
so
it
is
he
said
unless
one
kills
them
at
once
i
have
often
felt
angry
with
men
for
killing
a
bird
i
hated
to
pick
up
the
little
warm
body
and
see
the
bright
eye
looking
so
reproachfully
at
me
and
feel
the
flutter
of
life
we
animals
or
rather
the
most
of
us
kill
mercifully
it
is
only
human
beings
who
butcher
their
prey
and
seem
some
of
them
to
rejoice
in
their
agony
i
used
to
be
eager
to
kill
birds
and
rabbits
but
i
did
not
want
to
keep
them
before
me
long
after
they
were
dead
i
often
stop
in
the
street
and
look
up
at
fine
ladies
bonnets
and
wonder
how
they
can
wear
little
dead
birds
in
such
dreadful
positions
some
of
them
have
their
heads
twisted
under
their
wings
and
over
their
shoulders
and
looking
toward
their
tails
and
their
eyes
are
so
horrible
that
i
wish
i
could
take
those
ladies
into
the
woods
and
let
them
see
how
easy
and
pretty
a
live
bird
is
and
how
unlike
the
stuffed
creatures
they
wear
have
you
ever
had
a
good
run
in
the
woods
joe
no
never
i
said
some
day
i
will
take
you
and
now
it
is
late
and
i
must
go
to
bed
are
you
going
to
sleep
in
the
kennel
with
me
or
in
the
stable
i
think
i
will
sleep
with
you
jim
dogs
like
company
you
know
as
well
as
human
beings
i
curled
up
in
the
straw
beside
him
and
soon
we
were
fast
asleep
i
have
known
a
good
many
dogs
but
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
such
a
good
one
as
jim
he
was
gentle
and
kind
and
so
sensitive
that
a
hard
word
hurt
him
more
than
a
blow
he
was
a
great
pet
with
morris
and
as
he
had
been
so
well
trained
he
was
able
to
make
himself
very
useful
to
her
when
she
went
shopping
he
often
carried
a
parcel
in
his
mouth
for
her
he
would
never
drop
it
nor
leave
it
anywhere
one
day
she
dropped
her
purse
without
knowing
it
and
jim
picked
it
up
and
brought
it
home
in
his
mouth
she
did
not
notice
him
for
he
always
walked
behind
her
when
she
got
to
her
own
door
she
missed
the
purse
and
turning
around
saw
it
in
jim
mouth
another
day
a
lady
gave
jack
morris
a
canary
cage
as
a
present
for
carl
he
was
bringing
it
home
when
one
of
the
little
seed
boxes
fell
out
jim
picked
it
up
and
carried
it
a
long
way
before
jack
discovered
it
chapter
ix
the
parrot
bella
i
often
used
to
hear
the
morrises
speak
about
vessels
that
ran
between
fairport
and
a
place
called
the
west
indies
carrying
cargoes
of
lumber
and
fish
and
bringing
home
molasses
spices
fruit
and
other
things
on
one
of
these
vessels
called
the
mary
jane
was
a
cabin
boy
who
was
a
friend
of
the
morris
boys
and
often
brought
them
presents
one
day
after
i
had
been
with
the
morrises
for
some
months
this
boy
arrived
at
the
house
with
a
bunch
of
green
bananas
in
one
hand
and
a
parrot
in
the
other
the
boys
were
delighted
with
the
parrot
and
called
their
mother
to
see
what
a
pretty
bird
she
was
morris
seemed
very
much
touched
by
the
boy
thoughtfulness
in
bringing
a
present
such
a
long
distance
to
her
boys
and
thanked
him
warmly
the
cabin
boy
became
very
shy
and
all
he
could
say
was
go
way
over
and
over
again
in
a
very
awkward
manner
morris
smiled
and
left
him
with
the
boys
i
think
that
she
thought
he
would
be
more
comfortable
with
them
jack
put
me
up
on
the
table
to
look
at
the
parrot
the
boy
held
her
by
a
string
tied
around
one
of
her
legs
she
was
a
gray
parrot
with
a
few
red
feathers
in
her
tail
and
she
had
bright
eyes
and
a
very
knowing
air
the
boy
said
he
had
been
careful
to
buy
a
young
one
that
could
not
speak
for
he
knew
the
morris
boys
would
not
want
one
chattering
foreign
gibberish
nor
yet
one
that
would
swear
he
had
kept
her
in
his
bunk
in
the
ship
and
had
spent
all
his
leisure
time
in
teaching
her
to
talk
then
he
looked
at
her
anxiously
and
said
show
off
now
ca
ye
i
did
know
what
he
meant
by
all
this
until
afterward
i
had
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
as
birds
talking
i
stood
on
the
table
staring
hard
at
her
and
she
stared
hard
at
me
i
was
just
thinking
that
i
would
not
like
to
have
her
sharp
little
beak
fastened
in
my
skin
when
i
heard
some
one
say
beautiful
joe
the
voice
seemed
to
come
from
the
room
but
i
knew
all
the
voices
there
and
this
was
one
i
had
never
heard
before
so
i
thought
i
must
be
mistaken
and
it
was
some
one
in
the
hall
i
struggled
to
get
away
from
jack
to
run
and
see
who
it
was
but
he
held
me
fast
and
laughed
with
all
his
might
i
looked
at
the
other
boys
and
they
were
laughing
too
presently
i
heard
again
beautiful
joe
beautiful
joe
the
sound
was
close
by
and
yet
it
did
not
come
from
the
cabin
boy
for
he
was
all
doubled
up
laughing
his
face
as
red
as
a
beet
it
the
parrot
joe
cried
ned
look
at
her
you
gaby
i
did
look
at
her
and
with
her
head
on
one
side
and
the
sauciest
air
in
the
world
she
was
saying
joe
joe
i
had
never
heard
a
bird
talk
before
and
i
felt
so
sheepish
that
i
tried
to
get
down
and
hide
myself
under
the
table
then
she
began
to
laugh
at
me
ha
ha
ha
good
dog
sic
boy
rats
rats
joe
joe
she
cried
rattling
off
the
words
as
fast
as
she
could
i
never
felt
so
queer
before
in
my
life
and
the
boys
were
just
roaring
with
delight
at
my
puzzled
face
then
the
parrot
began
calling
for
jim
where
jim
where
good
old
jim
poor
old
dog
give
him
a
bone
the
boys
brought
jim
in
the
parlor
and
when
he
heard
her
funny
little
cracked
voice
calling
him
he
nearly
went
crazy
jimmy
jimmy
james
augustus
she
said
which
was
jim
long
name
he
made
a
dash
out
of
the
room
and
the
boys
screamed
so
that
morris
came
down
from
his
study
to
see
what
the
noise
meant
as
soon
as
the
parrot
saw
him
she
would
not
utter
another
word
the
boys
told
him
though
what
she
had
been
saying
and
he
seemed
much
amused
to
think
that
the
cabin
boy
should
have
remembered
so
many
sayings
his
boys
made
use
of
and
taught
them
to
the
parrot
clever
polly
he
said
kindly
good
polly
the
cabin
boy
looked
at
him
shyly
and
jack
who
was
a
very
sharp
boy
said
quickly
is
not
that
what
you
call
her
henry
no
said
the
boy
i
call
her
bell
short
for
bellzebub
i
beg
your
pardon
said
jack
very
politely
bell
short
for
bellzebub
repeated
the
boy
ye
see
i
thought
like
a
name
from
the
bible
bein
a
minister
sons
i
had
my
bible
with
me
on
this
cruise
savin
yer
presence
an
i
could
think
of
any
girls
names
out
of
it
but
eve
or
queen
of
sheba
an
they
did
seem
very
fit
so
i
asked
one
of
me
mates
an
he
says
for
his
part
he
guessed
bellzebub
was
as
pretty
a
girl
name
as
any
so
i
guv
her
that
been
better
to
let
you
name
her
but
ye
see
been
handy
not
to
call
her
somethin
where
i
was
teachin
her
every
day
jack
turned
away
and
walked
to
the
window
his
face
a
deep
scarlet
i
heard
him
mutter
beelzebub
prince
of
devils
so
i
suppose
the
cabin
boy
had
given
his
bird
a
bad
name
morris
looked
kindly
at
the
cabin
boy
do
you
ever
call
the
parrot
by
her
whole
name
no
sir
he
replied
i
always
give
her
bell
but
she
calls
herself
bella
bella
repeated
morris
that
is
a
very
pretty
name
if
you
keep
her
boys
i
think
you
had
better
stick
to
that
yes
father
they
all
said
and
then
morris
started
to
go
back
to
his
study
on
the
doorsill
he
paused
to
ask
the
cabin
boy
when
his
ship
sailed
finding
that
it
was
to
be
in
a
few
days
he
took
out
his
and
wrote
something
in
it
the
next
day
he
asked
jack
to
go
to
town
with
him
and
when
they
came
home
jack
said
that
his
father
had
bought
an
coat
for
henry
smith
and
a
handsome
bible
in
which
they
were
all
to
write
their
names
after
morris
left
the
room
the
door
opened
and
miss
laura
came
in
she
knew
nothing
about
the
parrot
and
was
very
much
surprised
to
see
it
seating
herself
at
the
table
she
held
out
her
hands
to
it
she
was
so
fond
of
pets
of
all
kinds
that
she
never
thought
of
being
afraid
of
them
at
the
same
time
she
never
laid
her
hand
suddenly
on
any
animal
she
held
out
her
fingers
and
talked
gently
so
that
if
it
wished
to
come
to
her
it
could
she
looked
at
the
parrot
as
if
she
loved
it
and
the
queer
little
thing
walked
right
up
and
nestled
its
head
against
the
lace
in
the
front
of
her
dress
pretty
lady
she
said
in
a
cracked
whisper
give
bella
a
kiss
the
boys
were
so
pleased
with
this
and
set
up
such
a
shout
that
their
mother
came
into
the
room
and
said
they
had
better
take
the
parrot
out
to
the
stable
bella
seem
to
enjoy
the
fun
come
on
boys
she
screamed
as
henry
smith
lifted
her
on
his
finger
ha
ha
ha
come
on
let
have
some
fun
where
the
guinea
pig
where
davy
the
rat
where
pussy
pussy
pussy
come
here
pussy
pussy
dear
pretty
puss
her
voice
was
shrill
and
distinct
and
very
like
the
voice
of
an
old
woman
who
came
to
the
house
for
rags
and
bones
i
followed
her
out
to
the
stable
and
stayed
there
until
she
noticed
me
and
screamed
out
ha
joe
beautiful
joe
where
your
tail
who
cut
your
ears
off
i
do
think
it
was
kind
in
the
cabin
boy
to
teach
her
this
and
i
think
she
knew
it
teased
me
for
she
said
it
over
and
over
again
and
laughed
and
chuckled
with
delight
i
left
her
and
did
not
see
her
till
the
next
day
when
the
boys
had
got
a
fine
large
cage
for
her
the
place
for
her
cage
was
by
one
of
the
hall
windows
but
everybody
in
the
house
got
so
fond
of
her
that
she
was
moved
about
from
one
room
to
another
she
hated
her
cage
and
used
to
put
her
head
close
to
the
bars
and
plead
let
bella
out
bella
will
be
a
good
girl
bella
wo
run
away
after
a
time
the
morrises
did
let
her
out
and
she
kept
her
word
and
never
tried
to
get
away
jack
put
a
little
handle
on
her
cage
door
so
that
she
could
open
and
shut
it
herself
and
it
was
very
amusing
to
hear
her
say
in
the
morning
clear
the
track
children
bella
going
to
take
a
walk
and
see
her
turn
the
handle
with
her
claw
and
come
out
into
the
room
she
was
a
very
clever
bird
and
i
have
never
seen
any
creature
but
a
human
being
that
could
reason
as
she
did
she
was
so
petted
and
talked
to
that
she
got
to
know
a
great
many
words
and
on
one
occasion
she
saved
the
morrises
from
being
robbed
it
was
in
the
winter
time
the
family
was
having
tea
in
the
dining
room
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
billy
and
i
were
lying
in
the
hall
watching
what
was
going
on
there
was
no
one
in
the
front
of
the
house
the
hall
lamp
was
lighted
and
the
hall
door
closed
but
not
locked
some
sneak
thieves
who
had
been
doing
a
great
deal
of
mischief
in
fairport
crept
up
the
steps
and
into
the
house
and
opening
the
door
of
the
hall
closet
laid
their
hands
on
the
boys
winter
overcoats
they
thought
no
one
saw
them
but
they
were
mistaken
bella
had
been
having
a
nap
upstairs
and
had
not
come
down
when
the
tea
bell
rang
now
she
was
hopping
down
on
her
way
to
the
dining
room
and
hearing
the
slight
noise
below
stopped
and
looked
through
the
railing
any
pet
creature
that
lives
in
a
nice
family
hates
a
dirty
shabby
person
bella
knew
that
those
beggar
boys
had
no
business
in
that
closet
bad
boys
she
screamed
angrily
get
out
get
out
here
joe
joe
beautiful
joe
come
quick
billy
billy
rats
hie
out
jim
sic
boys
where
the
police
call
the
police
billy
and
i
sprang
up
and
pushed
open
the
door
leading
to
the
front
hall
the
thieves
in
a
terrible
fright
were
just
rushing
down
the
front
steps
one
of
them
got
away
but
the
other
fell
and
i
caught
him
by
the
coat
till
morris
ran
and
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
was
a
young
fellow
about
jack
age
but
not
so
manly
and
he
was
sniffling
and
scolding
about
that
pesky
parrot
morris
made
him
come
back
into
the
house
and
had
a
talk
with
him
he
found
out
that
he
was
a
poor
ignorant
lad
half
starved
by
a
drunken
father
he
and
his
brother
stole
clothes
and
sent
them
to
his
sister
in
boston
who
sold
them
and
returned
part
of
the
money
morris
asked
him
if
he
would
not
like
to
get
his
living
in
an
honest
way
and
he
said
he
had
tried
to
but
no
one
would
employ
him
morris
told
him
to
go
home
and
take
leave
of
his
father
and
get
his
brother
and
bring
him
to
washington
street
the
next
day
he
told
him
plainly
that
if
he
did
not
he
would
send
a
policeman
after
him
the
boy
begged
morris
not
to
do
that
and
early
the
next
morning
he
appeared
with
his
brother
morris
gave
them
a
good
breakfast
and
fitted
them
out
with
clothes
and
they
were
sent
off
in
the
train
to
one
of
her
brothers
who
was
a
kind
farmer
in
the
country
and
who
had
been
telegraphed
to
that
these
boys
were
coming
and
wished
to
be
provided
with
situations
where
they
would
have
a
chance
to
make
honest
men
of
themselves
chapter
x
billy
training
continued
when
billy
was
five
months
old
he
had
his
first
walk
in
the
street
miss
laura
knew
that
he
had
been
well
trained
so
she
did
not
hesitate
to
take
him
into
the
town
she
was
not
the
kind
of
a
young
lady
to
go
into
the
street
with
a
dog
that
would
not
behave
himself
and
she
was
never
willing
to
attract
attention
to
herself
by
calling
out
orders
to
any
of
her
pets
as
soon
as
we
got
down
the
front
steps
she
said
quietly
to
billy
to
heel
it
was
very
hard
for
little
playful
billy
to
keep
close
to
her
when
he
saw
so
many
new
and
wonderful
things
about
him
he
had
gotten
acquainted
with
everything
in
the
house
and
garden
but
this
outside
world
was
full
of
things
he
wanted
to
look
at
and
smell
of
and
he
was
fairly
crazy
to
play
with
some
of
the
pretty
dogs
he
saw
running
about
but
he
did
just
as
he
was
told
soon
we
came
to
a
shop
and
miss
laura
went
in
to
buy
some
ribbons
she
said
to
me
stay
out
but
billy
she
took
in
with
her
i
watched
them
through
the
glass
door
and
saw
her
go
to
a
counter
and
sit
down
billy
stood
behind
her
till
she
said
lie
down
then
he
curled
himself
at
her
feet
he
lay
quietly
even
when
she
left
him
and
went
to
another
counter
but
he
eyed
her
very
anxiously
till
she
came
back
and
said
up
to
him
then
he
sprang
up
and
followed
her
out
to
the
street
she
stood
in
the
shop
door
and
looked
lovingly
down
on
us
as
we
fawned
on
her
good
dogs
she
said
softly
you
shall
have
a
present
we
went
behind
her
again
and
she
took
us
to
a
shop
where
we
both
lay
beside
the
counter
when
we
heard
her
ask
the
clerk
for
solid
rubber
balls
we
could
scarcely
keep
still
we
both
knew
what
ball
meant
taking
the
parcel
in
her
hand
she
came
out
into
the
street
she
did
not
do
any
more
shopping
but
turned
her
face
toward
the
sea
she
was
going
to
give
us
a
nice
walk
along
the
beach
although
it
was
a
dark
disagreeable
cloudy
day
when
most
young
ladies
would
have
stayed
in
the
house
the
morris
children
never
minded
the
weather
even
in
the
pouring
rain
the
boys
would
put
on
rubber
boots
and
coats
and
go
out
to
play
miss
laura
walked
along
the
high
wind
blowing
her
cloak
and
dress
about
and
when
we
got
past
the
houses
she
had
a
little
run
with
us
we
jumped
and
frisked
and
barked
till
we
were
tired
and
then
we
walked
quietly
along
a
little
distance
ahead
of
us
were
some
boys
throwing
sticks
in
the
water
for
two
newfoundland
dogs
suddenly
a
quarrel
sprang
up
between
the
dogs
they
were
both
powerful
creatures
and
fairly
matched
as
regarded
size
it
was
terrible
to
hear
their
fierce
growling
and
to
see
the
way
in
which
they
tore
at
each
other
throats
i
looked
at
miss
laura
if
she
had
said
a
word
i
would
have
run
in
and
helped
the
dog
that
was
getting
the
worst
of
it
but
she
told
me
to
keep
back
and
ran
on
herself
the
boys
were
throwing
water
on
the
dogs
and
pulling
their
tails
and
hurling
stones
at
them
but
they
could
not
separate
them
their
heads
seemed
locked
together
and
they
went
back
and
forth
over
the
stones
the
boys
crowding
around
them
shouting
and
beating
and
kicking
at
them
stand
back
boys
said
miss
laura
i
stop
them
she
pulled
a
little
parcel
from
her
purse
bent
over
the
dogs
scattered
a
powder
on
their
noses
and
the
next
instant
the
dogs
were
yards
apart
nearly
sneezing
their
heads
off
i
say
missis
what
did
you
do
what
that
stuff
whew
it
pepper
the
boys
exclaimed
miss
laura
sat
down
on
a
flat
rock
and
looked
at
them
with
a
very
pale
face
oh
boys
she
said
why
did
you
make
those
dogs
fight
it
is
so
cruel
they
were
playing
happily
till
you
set
them
on
each
other
just
see
how
they
have
torn
their
handsome
coats
and
how
the
blood
is
dripping
from
them
my
fault
said
one
of
the
lads
sullenly
jim
jones
there
said
his
dog
could
lick
my
dog
and
i
said
he
could
and
he
could
neither
yes
he
could
cried
the
other
boy
and
if
you
say
he
could
smash
your
head
the
two
boys
began
sidling
up
to
each
other
with
clenched
fists
and
a
third
boy
who
had
a
mischievous
face
seized
the
paper
that
had
had
the
pepper
in
it
and
running
up
to
them
shook
it
in
their
faces
there
was
enough
left
to
put
all
thoughts
of
fighting
out
of
their
heads
they
began
to
cough
and
choke
and
splutter
and
finally
found
themselves
beside
the
dogs
where
the
four
of
them
had
a
lively
time
the
other
boys
yelled
with
delight
and
pointed
their
fingers
at
them
a
sneezing
concert
thank
you
gentlemen
angcore
miss
laura
laughed
too
she
could
not
help
it
and
even
billy
and
i
curled
up
our
lips
after
a
while
they
sobered
down
and
then
finding
that
the
boys
had
a
handkerchief
between
them
miss
laura
took
her
own
soft
one
and
dipping
it
in
a
spring
of
fresh
water
near
by
wiped
the
red
eyes
of
the
sneezers
their
ill
humor
had
gone
and
when
she
turned
to
leave
them
and
said
coaxingly
you
wo
make
those
dogs
fight
any
more
will
you
they
said
no
sirree
bob
miss
laura
went
slowly
home
and
ever
afterward
when
she
met
any
of
those
boys
they
called
her
miss
pepper
when
we
got
home
we
found
willie
curled
up
by
the
window
in
the
hall
reading
a
book
he
was
too
fond
of
reading
and
his
mother
often
told
him
to
put
away
his
book
and
run
about
with
the
other
boys
this
afternoon
miss
laura
laid
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
said
i
was
going
to
give
the
dogs
a
little
game
of
ball
but
i
rather
tired
gammon
and
spinach
he
replied
shaking
off
her
hand
you
always
tired
she
sat
down
in
a
hall
chair
and
looked
at
him
then
she
began
to
tell
him
about
the
dog
fight
he
was
much
interested
and
the
book
slipped
to
the
floor
when
she
finished
he
said
you
a
daisy
every
day
go
now
and
rest
yourself
then
snatching
the
balls
from
her
he
called
us
and
ran
down
to
the
basement
but
he
was
not
quick
enough
though
to
escape
her
arm
she
caught
him
to
her
and
kissed
him
repeatedly
he
was
the
baby
and
pet
of
the
family
and
he
loved
her
dearly
though
he
spoke
impatiently
to
her
oftener
than
either
of
the
other
boys
we
had
a
grand
game
with
willie
miss
laura
had
trained
us
to
do
all
kinds
of
things
with
balls
jumping
for
them
playing
and
catching
them
billy
could
do
more
things
than
i
could
one
thing
he
did
which
i
thought
was
very
clever
he
played
ball
by
himself
he
was
so
crazy
about
ball
play
that
he
could
never
get
enough
of
it
miss
laura
played
all
she
could
with
him
but
she
had
to
help
her
mother
with
the
sewing
and
the
housework
and
do
lessons
with
her
father
for
she
was
only
seventeen
years
old
and
had
not
left
off
studying
so
billy
would
take
his
ball
and
go
off
by
himself
sometimes
he
rolled
it
over
the
floor
and
sometimes
he
threw
it
in
the
air
and
pushed
it
through
the
staircase
railings
to
the
hall
below
he
always
listened
till
he
heard
it
drop
then
he
ran
down
and
brought
it
back
and
pushed
it
through
again
he
did
this
till
he
was
tired
and
then
he
brought
the
ball
and
laid
it
at
miss
laura
feet
we
both
had
been
taught
a
number
of
tricks
we
could
sneeze
and
cough
and
be
dead
dogs
and
say
our
prayers
and
stand
on
our
heads
and
mount
a
ladder
and
say
the
alphabet
this
was
the
hardest
of
all
and
it
took
miss
laura
a
long
time
to
teach
us
we
never
began
till
a
book
was
laid
before
us
then
we
stared
at
it
and
miss
laura
said
begin
joe
and
billy
say
a
for
a
we
gave
a
little
squeal
b
was
louder
c
was
louder
still
we
barked
for
some
letters
and
growled
for
others
we
always
turned
a
summersault
for
when
we
got
to
z
we
gave
the
book
a
push
and
had
a
frolic
around
the
room
when
any
one
came
in
and
miss
laura
had
us
show
off
any
of
our
tricks
the
remark
always
was
what
clever
dogs
they
are
not
like
other
dogs
that
was
a
mistake
billy
and
i
were
not
any
brighter
than
many
a
miserable
cur
that
skulked
about
the
streets
of
fairport
it
was
kindness
and
patience
that
did
it
all
when
i
was
with
jenkins
he
thought
i
was
a
very
stupid
dog
he
would
have
laughed
at
the
idea
of
any
one
teaching
me
anything
but
i
was
only
sullen
and
obstinate
because
i
was
kicked
about
so
much
if
he
had
been
kind
to
me
i
would
have
done
anything
for
him
i
loved
to
wait
on
miss
laura
and
morris
and
they
taught
both
billy
and
me
to
make
ourselves
useful
about
the
house
morris
did
like
going
up
and
down
the
three
long
staircases
and
sometimes
we
just
raced
up
and
down
waiting
on
her
how
often
i
have
heard
her
go
into
the
hall
and
say
please
send
me
down
a
clean
duster
laura
joe
you
get
it
i
would
run
gayly
up
the
steps
and
then
would
come
billy
turn
billy
i
have
forgotten
my
keys
go
get
them
after
a
time
we
began
to
know
the
names
of
different
articles
and
where
they
were
kept
and
could
get
them
ourselves
on
sweeping
days
we
worked
very
hard
and
enjoyed
the
fun
if
morris
was
too
far
away
to
call
to
mary
for
what
she
wanted
she
wrote
the
name
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
told
us
to
take
it
to
her
billy
always
took
the
letters
from
the
postman
and
carried
the
morning
paper
up
to
morris
study
and
i
always
put
away
the
clean
clothes
after
they
were
mended
morris
folded
each
article
and
gave
it
to
me
mentioning
the
name
of
the
owner
so
that
i
could
lay
it
on
his
bed
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
tell
me
the
names
i
knew
by
the
smell
all
human
beings
have
a
strong
smell
to
a
dog
even
though
they
notice
it
themselves
morris
never
knew
how
she
bothered
me
by
giving
away
miss
laura
clothes
to
poor
people
once
i
followed
her
track
all
through
the
town
and
at
last
found
it
was
only
a
pair
of
her
boots
on
a
ragged
child
in
the
gutter
i
must
say
a
word
about
billy
tail
before
i
close
this
chapter
it
is
the
custom
to
cut
the
ends
of
fox
terrier
tails
but
leave
their
ears
untouched
billy
came
to
miss
laura
so
young
that
his
tail
had
not
been
cut
off
and
she
would
not
have
it
done
one
day
robinson
came
in
to
see
him
and
he
said
you
have
made
a
dog
of
him
but
his
appearance
is
ruined
by
the
length
of
his
tail
robinson
said
morris
patting
little
billy
who
lay
on
her
lap
do
you
think
that
this
little
dog
has
a
beautifully
proportioned
body
yes
i
do
said
the
gentleman
his
points
are
all
correct
save
that
one
but
she
said
if
our
creator
made
that
beautiful
little
body
you
think
he
is
wise
enough
to
know
what
length
of
tail
would
be
in
proportion
to
it
robinson
would
not
answer
her
he
only
laughed
and
said
that
he
thought
she
and
miss
laura
were
both
cranks
chapter

carl
was
a
born

he

books
with

and
they
never
got
the
better
of
him
in

bargain
he
said
that
when
he
grew
up
he
was
going
to
be
a
merchant
and
he
had
already
begun
to
carry
on
a
trade
in
canaries
and
goldfish
he
was
very
fond
of
what
he
called
his
yellow
pets
yet
he
never
kept
a
pair
of
birds
or
a
goldfish
if
he
had
a
good
offer
for
them
he
slept
alone
in
a
large
sunny
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
by
his
own
request
it
was
barely
furnished
and
there
he
raised
his
canaries
and
kept
his
goldfish
he
was
not
fond
of
having
visitors
coming
to
his
room
because
he
said
they
frightened
the
canaries
after
morris
made
his
bed
in
the
morning
the
door
was
closed
and
no
one
was
supposed
to
go
in
till
he
came
from
school
once
billy
and
i
followed
him
upstairs
without
his
knowing
it
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
us
he
sent
us
down
in
a
great
hurry
one
day
bella
walked
into
his
room
to
inspect
the
canaries
she
was
quite
a
spoiled
bird
by
this
time
and
i
heard
carl
telling
the
family
afterward
that
it
was
as
good
as
a
play
to
see
miss
bella
strutting
in
with
her
breast
stuck
out
and
her
little
conceited
air
and
hear
her
say
shrilly
good
morning
birds
good
morning
how
do
you
do
carl
glad
to
see
you
boy
well
i
not
glad
to
see
you
he
said
decidedly
and
do
you
ever
come
up
here
again
you
frighten
my
canaries
to
death
and
he
sent
her
flying
downstairs
how
cross
she
was
she
came
shrieking
to
miss
laura
bella
loves
birds
bella
would
hurt
birds
carl
a
bad
boy
miss
laura
petted
and
soothed
her
telling
her
to
go
find
davy
and
he
would
play
with
her
bella
and
the
rat
were
great
friends
it
was
very
funny
to
see
them
going
about
the
house
together
from
the
very
first
she
had
liked
him
and
coaxed
him
into
her
cage
where
he
soon
became
quite
at
home
so
much
so
that
he
always
slept
there
about
nine
every
evening
if
he
was
not
with
her
she
went
all
over
the
house
crying
davy
davy
time
to
go
to
bed
come
sleep
in
cage
he
was
very
fond
of
the
nice
sweet
cakes
she
got
to
eat
but
she
never
could
get
him
to
eat
coffee
grounds
the
food
she
liked
best
miss
laura
spoke
to
carl
about
bella
and
told
him
he
had
hurt
her
feelings
so
he
petted
her
a
little
to
make
up
for
it
then
his
mother
told
him
that
she
thought
he
was
making
a
mistake
in
keeping
his
canaries
so
much
to
themselves
they
had
become
so
timid
that
when
she
went
into
the
room
they
were
uneasy
till
she
left
it
she
told
him
that
petted
birds
or
animals
are
sociable
and
like
company
unless
they
are
kept
by
themselves
when
they
become
shy
she
advised
him
to
let
the
other
boys
go
into
the
room
and
occasionally
to
bring
some
of
his
pretty
singers
downstairs
where
all
the
family
could
enjoy
seeing
and
hearing
them
and
where
they
would
get
used
to
other
people
besides
himself
carl
looked
thoughtful
and
his
mother
went
on
to
say
that
there
was
no
one
in
the
house
not
even
the
cat
that
would
harm
his
birds
you
might
even
charge
admission
for
a
day
or
two
said
jack
gravely
and
introduce
us
to
them
and
make
a
little
money
carl
was
rather
annoyed
at
this
but
his
mother
calmed
him
by
showing
him
a
letter
she
had
just
gotten
from
one
of
her
brothers
asking
her
to
let
one
of
her
boys
spend
his
christmas
holidays
in
the
country
with
him
i
want
you
to
go
carl
she
said
he
was
very
much
pleased
but
looked
sober
when
he
thought
of
his
pets
laura
and
i
will
take
care
of
them
said
his
mother
and
start
the
new
management
of
them
very
well
said
carl
i
will
go
then
i
no
young
ones
now
so
you
will
not
find
them
much
trouble
i
thought
it
was
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
take
care
of
them
the
first
morning
after
carl
left
billy
and
bella
and
davy
and
i
followed
miss
laura
upstairs
she
made
us
sit
in
a
row
by
the
door
lest
we
should
startle
the
canaries
she
had
a
great
many
things
to
do
first
the
canaries
had
their
baths
they
had
to
get
them
at
the
same
time
every
morning
miss
laura
filled
the
little
white
dishes
with
water
and
put
them
in
the
cages
and
then
came
and
sat
on
a
stool
by
the
door
bella
and
billy
and
davy
climbed
into
her
lap
and
i
stood
close
by
her
it
was
so
funny
to
watch
those
canaries
they
put
their
heads
on
one
side
and
looked
first
at
their
little
baths
and
then
at
us
they
knew
we
were
strangers
finally
as
we
were
all
very
quiet
they
got
into
the
water
and
what
a
good
time
they
had
fluttering
their
wings
and
splashing
and
cleaning
themselves
so
nicely
then
they
got
up
on
their
perches
and
sat
in
the
sun
shaking
themselves
and
picking
at
their
feathers
miss
laura
cleaned
each
cage
and
gave
each
bird
some
mixed
rape
and
canary
seed
i
heard
carl
tell
her
before
he
left
not
to
give
them
much
hemp
seed
for
that
was
too
fattening
he
was
very
careful
about
their
food
during
the
summer
i
had
often
seen
him
taking
up
nice
green
things
to
them
celery
chickweed
tender
cabbage
peaches
apples
pears
bananas
and
now
at
christmas
time
he
had
green
stuff
growing
in
pots
on
the
window
ledge
besides
that
he
gave
them
crumbs
of
coarse
bread
crackers
lumps
of
sugar
to
peck
at
and
a
number
of
other
things
miss
laura
did
everything
just
as
he
told
her
but
i
think
she
talked
to
the
birds
more
than
he
did
she
was
very
particular
about
their
drinking
water
and
washed
out
the
little
glass
cups
that
held
it
most
carefully
after
the
canaries
were
clean
and
comfortable
miss
laura
set
their
cages
in
the
sun
and
turned
to
the
goldfish
they
were
in
large
glass
globes
on
the
she
took
a
tin
cup
and
dipped
out
the
fish
from
one
into
a
basin
of
water
then
she
washed
the
globe
thoroughly
and
put
the
fish
back
and
scattered
wafers
of
fish
food
on
the
top
the
fish
came
up
and
snapped
at
it
and
acted
as
if
they
were
glad
to
get
it
she
did
each
globe
and
then
her
work
was
over
for
one
morning
she
went
away
for
a
while
but
every
few
hours
through
the
day
she
ran
up
to
carl
room
to
see
how
the
fish
and
canaries
were
getting
on
if
the
room
was
too
chilly
she
turned
on
more
heat
but
she
did
not
keep
it
too
warm
for
that
would
make
the
birds
tender
after
a
time
the
canaries
got
to
know
her
and
hopped
gayly
around
their
cages
and
chirped
and
sang
whenever
they
saw
her
coming
then
she
began
to
take
some
of
them
downstairs
and
to
let
them
out
of
their
cages
for
an
hour
or
two
every
day
they
were
very
happy
little
creatures
and
chased
each
other
about
the
room
and
flew
on
miss
laura
head
and
pecked
saucily
at
her
face
as
she
sat
sewing
and
watching
them
they
were
not
at
all
afraid
of
me
nor
of
billy
and
it
was
quite
a
sight
to
see
them
hopping
up
to
bella
she
looked
so
large
beside
them
one
little
bird
became
ill
while
carl
was
away
and
miss
laura
had
to
give
it
a
great
deal
of
attention
she
gave
it
plenty
of
hemp
seed
to
make
it
fat
and
very
often
the
yolk
of
a
egg
and
kept
a
nail
in
its
drinking
water
and
gave
it
a
few
drops
of
alcohol
in
its
bath
every
morning
to
keep
it
from
taking
cold
the
moment
the
bird
finished
taking
its
bath
miss
laura
took
the
dish
from
the
cage
for
the
alcohol
made
the
water
poisonous
then
vermin
came
on
it
and
she
had
to
write
to
carl
to
ask
him
what
to
do
he
told
her
to
hang
a
muslin
bag
full
of
sulphur
over
the
swing
so
that
the
bird
would
dust
it
down
on
her
feathers
that
cured
the
little
thing
and
when
carl
came
home
he
found
it
quite
well
again
one
day
just
after
he
got
back
montague
drove
up
to
the
house
with
a
canary
cage
carefully
done
up
in
a
shawl
she
said
that
a
housemaid
in
cleaning
the
cage
that
morning
had
gotten
angry
with
the
bird
and
struck
it
breaking
its
leg
she
was
very
much
annoyed
with
the
girl
for
her
cruelty
and
had
dismissed
her
and
now
she
wanted
carl
to
take
her
bird
and
nurse
it
as
she
knew
nothing
about
canaries
carl
had
just
come
in
from
school
he
threw
down
his
books
took
the
shawl
from
the
cage
and
looked
in
the
poor
little
canary
was
sitting
in
a
corner
it
eyes
were
half
shut
one
leg
hung
loose
and
it
was
making
faint
chirps
of
distress
carl
was
very
much
interested
in
it
he
got
montague
to
help
him
and
together
they
split
matches
tore
up
strips
of
muslin
and
bandaged
the
broken
leg
he
put
the
little
bird
back
in
the
cage
and
it
seemed
more
comfortable
i
think
he
will
do
now
he
said
to
montague
but
had
you
better
leave
him
with
me
for
a
few
days
she
gladly
agreed
to
this
and
went
away
after
telling
him
that
the
bird
name
was
dick
the
next
morning
at
the
breakfast
table
i
heard
carl
telling
his
mother
that
as
soon
as
he
woke
up
he
sprang
out
of
bed
and
went
to
see
how
his
canary
was
during
the
night
poor
foolish
dick
had
picked
off
the
splints
from
his
leg
and
now
it
was
as
bad
as
ever
i
shall
have
to
perform
a
surgical
operation
he
said
i
did
not
know
what
he
meant
so
i
watched
him
when
after
breakfast
he
brought
the
bird
down
to
his
mother
room
she
held
it
while
he
took
a
pair
of
sharp
scissors
and
cut
its
leg
right
off
a
little
way
above
the
broken
place
then
he
put
some
vaseline
on
the
tiny
stump
bound
it
up
and
left
dick
in
his
mother
care
all
the
morning
as
she
sat
sewing
she
watched
him
to
see
that
he
did
not
pick
the
bandage
away
when
carl
came
home
dick
was
so
much
better
that
he
had
managed
to
fly
up
on
his
perch
and
was
eating
seeds
quite
gayly
poor
dick
said
carl
leg
and
a
stump
dick
imitated
him
in
a
few
little
chirps
a
leg
and
a
stump
why
he
is
saying
it
too
exclaimed
carl
and
burst
out
laughing
dick
seemed
cheerful
enough
but
it
was
very
pitiful
to
see
him
dragging
his
poor
little
stump
around
the
cage
and
resting
it
against
the
perch
to
keep
him
from
falling
when
montague
came
the
next
day
she
could
not
bear
to
look
at
him
oh
dear
she
exclaimed
i
can
not
take
that
disfigured
bird
home
i
could
not
help
thinking
how
different
she
was
from
miss
laura
who
loved
any
creature
all
the
more
for
having
some
blemish
about
it
what
shall
i
do
said
montague
i
miss
my
little
bird
so
much
i
shall
have
to
get
a
new
one
carl
will
you
sell
me
one
i
will
you
one
montague
said
the
boy
eagerly
i
would
like
to
do
so
morris
looked
pleased
to
hear
carl
say
this
she
used
to
fear
sometimes
that
in
his
love
for
making
money
he
would
become
selfish
montague
was
very
kind
to
the
morris
family
and
carl
seemed
quite
pleased
to
do
her
a
favor
he
took
her
up
to
his
room
and
let
her
choose
the
bird
she
liked
best
she
took
a
handsome
yellow
one
called
barry
he
was
a
good
singer
and
a
great
favorite
of
carl
the
boy
put
him
in
the
cage
wrapped
it
up
well
for
it
was
a
cold
snowy
day
and
carried
it
out
to
montague
sleigh
she
gave
him
a
pleasant
smile
and
drove
away
and
carl
ran
up
the
steps
into
the
house
it
all
right
mother
he
said
giving
morris
a
hearty
boyish
kiss
as
she
stood
waiting
for
him
i
do
mind
letting
her
have
it
but
you
expected
to
sell
that
one
did
you
she
asked
smith
said
maybe
she
take
it
when
she
came
home
from
boston
but
i
dare
say
she
change
her
mind
and
get
one
there
how
much
were
you
going
to
ask
for
him
well
i
would
sell
barry
for
less
than
ten
dollars
or
rather
i
would
have
sold
him
and
he
ran
out
to
the
stable
morris
sat
on
the
hall
chair
patting
me
as
i
rubbed
against
her
in
rather
an
absentminded
way
then
she
got
up
and
went
into
her
husband
study
and
told
him
what
carl
had
done
morris
seemed
very
pleased
to
hear
about
it
but
when
his
wife
asked
him
to
do
something
to
make
up
the
loss
to
the
boy
he
said
i
had
rather
not
do
that
to
encourage
a
child
to
do
a
kind
action
and
then
to
reward
him
for
it
is
not
always
a
sound
principle
to
go
upon
but
carl
did
not
go
without
his
reward
that
evening
coachman
brought
a
note
to
the
house
addressed
to
carl
morris
he
read
it
aloud
to
the
family
my
dear
carl
i
am
charmed
with
my
little
bird
and
he
has
whispered
to
me
one
of
the
secrets
of
your
room
you
want
fifteen
dollars
very
much
to
buy
something
for
it
i
am
sure
you
wo
be
offended
with
an
old
friend
for
supplying
you
the
means
to
get
this
something
ada
montague
just
the
thing
for
my
stationary
tank
for
the
goldfish
exclaimed
carl
i
wanted
it
for
a
long
time
it
is
good
to
keep
them
in
globes
but
how
in
the
world
did
she
find
out
i
never
told
any
one
morris
smiled
and
said
barry
must
have
told
her
as
she
took
the
money
from
carl
to
put
away
for
him
montague
got
to
be
very
fond
of
her
new
pet
she
took
care
of
him
herself
and
i
have
heard
her
tell
morris
most
wonderful
stories
about
him
stories
so
wonderful
that
i
should
say
they
were
not
true
if
i
did
not
how
intelligent
dumb
creatures
get
to
be
under
kind
treatment
she
only
kept
him
in
his
cage
at
night
and
when
she
began
looking
for
him
at
bedtime
to
put
him
there
he
always
hid
himself
she
would
search
a
short
time
and
then
sit
down
and
he
always
came
out
of
his
chirping
in
a
saucy
way
to
make
her
look
at
him
she
said
that
he
seemed
to
take
delight
in
teasing
her
once
when
he
was
in
the
with
her
she
was
called
away
to
speak
to
some
one
at
the
telephone
when
she
came
back
she
found
that
one
of
the
servants
had
come
into
the
room
and
left
the
door
open
leading
to
a
veranda
the
trees
outside
were
full
of
yellow
birds
and
she
was
in
despair
thinking
that
barry
had
flown
out
with
them
she
looked
out
but
could
not
see
him
then
lest
he
had
not
left
the
room
she
got
a
chair
and
carried
it
about
standing
on
it
to
examine
the
walls
and
see
if
barry
was
hidden
among
the
pictures
and
but
no
barry
was
there
she
at
last
sank
down
exhausted
on
a
sofa
she
heard
a
wicked
little
peep
and
looking
up
saw
barry
sitting
on
one
of
the
rounds
of
the
chair
that
she
had
been
carrying
about
to
look
for
him
he
had
been
there
all
the
time
she
was
so
glad
to
see
him
that
she
never
thought
of
scolding
him
he
was
never
allowed
to
fly
about
the
dining
room
during
meals
and
the
table
maid
drove
him
out
before
she
set
the
table
it
always
annoyed
him
and
he
perched
on
the
staircase
watching
the
door
through
the
railings
if
it
was
left
open
for
an
instant
he
flew
in
one
evening
before
tea
he
did
this
there
was
a
chocolate
cake
on
the
sideboard
and
he
liked
the
look
of
it
so
much
that
he
began
to
peck
at
it
montague
happened
to
come
in
and
drove
him
back
to
the
hall
while
she
was
having
tea
that
evening
with
her
husband
and
little
boy
barry
flew
into
the
room
again
montague
told
charlie
to
send
him
out
but
her
husband
said
wait
he
is
looking
for
something
he
was
on
the
sideboard
peering
into
every
dish
and
trying
to
look
under
the
covers
he
is
after
the
chocolate
cake
exclaimed
mrs
montague
here
charlie
put
this
on
the
staircase
for
him
she
cut
off
a
little
scrap
and
when
charlie
took
it
to
the
hall
barry
flew
after
him
and
ate
it
up
as
for
poor
little
lame
dick
carl
never
sold
him
and
he
became
a
family
pet
his
cage
hung
in
the
parlor
and
from
morning
till
night
his
cheerful
voice
was
heard
chirping
and
singing
as
if
he
had
not
a
trouble
in
the
world
they
took
great
care
of
him
he
was
never
allowed
to
be
too
hot
or
too
cold
everybody
gave
him
a
cheerful
word
in
passing
his
cage
and
if
his
singing
was
too
loud
they
gave
him
a
little
mirror
to
look
at
himself
in
he
loved
this
mirror
and
often
stood
before
it
for
an
hour
at
a
time
chapter
xii
malta
the
cat
the
first
time
i
had
a
good
look
at
the
morris
cat
i
thought
she
was
the
animal
i
had
ever
seen
she
was
dark
gray
just
the
color
of
a
mouse
her
eyes
were
a
yellowish
green
and
for
the
first
few
days
i
was
at
the
morrises
they
looked
very
unkindly
at
me
then
she
got
over
her
dislike
and
we
became
very
good
friends
she
was
a
beautiful
cat
and
so
gentle
and
affectionate
that
the
whole
family
loved
her
she
was
three
years
old
and
she
had
come
to
fairport
in
a
vessel
with
some
sailors
who
had
gotten
her
in
a
place
her
name
was
malta
and
she
was
called
a
maltese
cat
i
have
seen
a
great
many
cats
but
i
never
saw
one
as
kind
as
malta
once
she
had
some
little
kittens
and
they
all
died
it
almost
broke
her
heart
she
cried
and
cried
about
the
house
till
it
made
one
feel
sad
to
hear
her
then
she
ran
away
to
the
woods
she
came
back
with
a
little
squirrel
in
her
mouth
and
putting
it
in
her
basket
she
nursed
it
like
a
mother
till
it
grew
old
enough
to
run
away
from
her
she
was
a
very
knowing
cat
and
always
came
when
she
was
called
miss
laura
used
to
wear
a
little
silver
whistle
that
she
blew
when
she
wanted
any
of
her
pets
it
was
a
shrill
whistle
and
we
could
hear
it
a
long
way
from
home
i
have
seen
her
standing
at
the
back
door
whistling
for
malta
and
the
pretty
creature
head
would
appear
somewhere
always
high
up
for
she
was
a
great
climber
and
she
would
come
running
along
the
top
of
the
fence
saying
meow
meow
in
a
funny
short
way
miss
laura
would
pet
her
or
give
her
something
to
eat
or
walk
around
the
garden
carrying
her
on
her
shoulder
malta
was
a
most
affectionate
cat
and
if
miss
laura
would
not
let
her
lick
her
face
she
licked
her
hair
with
her
little
rough
tongue
often
malta
lay
by
the
fire
licking
my
coat
or
little
billy
to
show
her
affection
for
us
mary
the
cook
was
very
fond
of
cats
and
used
to
keep
malta
in
the
kitchen
as
much
as
she
could
but
nothing
would
make
her
stay
down
there
if
there
was
any
music
going
on
upstairs
the
morris
pets
were
all
fond
of
music
as
soon
as
miss
laura
sat
down
to
the
piano
to
sing
or
play
we
came
from
all
parts
of
the
house
malta
cried
to
get
upstairs
davy
scampered
through
the
hall
and
bella
hurried
after
him
if
i
was
outdoors
i
ran
in
the
house
and
jim
got
on
a
box
and
looked
through
the
window
davy
place
was
on
miss
laura
shoulder
his
pink
nose
run
in
the
curls
at
the
back
of
her
neck
i
sat
under
the
piano
beside
malta
and
bella
and
we
never
stirred
till
the
music
was
over
then
we
went
quietly
away
malta
was
a
beautiful
cat
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
while
i
was
with
jenkins
i
thought
cats
were
vermin
like
rats
and
i
chased
them
every
chance
i
got
mrs
jenkins
had
a
cat
a
gaunt
yellow
creature
that
ran
whenever
we
looked
at
it
malta
had
been
so
kindly
treated
that
she
never
ran
from
any
one
except
from
strange
dogs
she
knew
they
would
be
likely
to
hurt
her
if
they
came
upon
her
suddenly
she
faced
them
and
she
was
a
pretty
good
fighter
when
she
was
put
to
it
i
once
saw
her
having
a
brush
with
a
big
mastiff
that
lived
a
few
blocks
from
us
and
giving
him
a
good
fright
which
just
served
him
right
i
was
shut
up
in
the
parlor
some
one
had
closed
the
door
and
i
could
not
get
out
i
was
watching
malta
from
the
window
as
she
daintily
picked
her
way
across
the
muddy
street
she
was
such
a
soft
pretty
cat
she
did
look
that
way
though
when
the
mastiff
rushed
out
of
the
alleyway
at
her
she
sprang
back
and
glared
at
him
like
a
little
fierce
tiger
her
tail
was
enormous
her
eyes
were
like
balls
of
fire
and
she
was
spitting
and
snarling
as
if
to
say
if
you
touch
me
i
tear
you
to
pieces
the
dog
big
as
he
was
did
not
dare
attack
her
he
walked
around
and
around
like
a
great
clumsy
elephant
and
she
turned
her
small
body
as
he
turned
his
and
kept
up
a
dreadful
hissing
and
spitting
suddenly
i
saw
a
spitz
dog
hurrying
down
the
street
he
was
going
to
help
the
mastiff
and
malta
would
be
badly
hurt
i
had
barked
and
no
one
had
come
to
let
me
out
so
i
sprang
through
the
window
just
then
there
was
a
change
malta
had
seen
the
second
dog
and
she
knew
she
must
get
rid
of
the
mastiff
with
an
agile
bound
she
sprang
on
his
back
dug
her
sharp
claws
in
till
he
put
his
tail
between
his
legs
and
ran
up
the
street
howling
with
pain
she
rode
a
little
way
then
sprang
off
and
ran
up
the
lane
to
the
stable
i
was
very
angry
and
wanted
to
fight
something
so
i
pitched
into
the
spitz
dog
he
was
a
snarly
creature
no
friend
to
jim
and
me
and
he
would
have
been
only
too
glad
of
a
chance
to
help
kill
malta
i
gave
him
one
of
the
worst
beatings
he
ever
had
i
do
suppose
it
was
quite
right
for
me
to
do
it
for
miss
laura
says
dogs
should
never
fight
but
he
had
worried
malta
before
and
he
had
no
business
to
do
it
she
belonged
to
our
family
jim
and
i
never
worried
cat
i
had
been
longing
to
give
him
a
shaking
for
some
time
and
now
i
felt
for
his
throat
through
his
thick
hair
and
dragged
him
all
around
the
street
then
i
let
him
go
and
he
was
a
civil
dog
ever
afterward
malta
was
very
grateful
and
licked
a
little
place
where
the
spitz
bit
me
i
did
not
get
scolded
for
the
broken
window
mary
had
seen
me
from
the
kitchen
window
and
told
morris
that
i
had
gone
to
help
malta
malta
was
a
very
wise
cat
she
knew
quite
well
that
she
must
not
harm
the
parrot
nor
the
canaries
and
she
never
tried
to
catch
them
even
though
she
was
left
alone
in
the
room
with
them
i
have
seen
her
lying
in
the
sun
blinking
sleepily
and
listening
with
great
pleasure
to
dick
singing
miss
laura
even
taught
her
not
to
hunt
the
birds
outside
for
a
long
time
she
had
tried
to
get
it
into
malta
head
that
it
was
cruel
to
catch
the
little
sparrows
that
came
about
the
door
and
just
after
i
came
she
succeeded
in
doing
so
malta
was
so
fond
of
miss
laura
that
whenever
she
caught
a
bird
she
came
and
laid
it
at
her
feet
miss
laura
always
picked
up
the
little
dead
creature
pitied
it
and
stroked
it
and
scolded
malta
till
she
crept
into
a
corner
then
miss
laura
put
the
bird
on
a
limb
of
a
tree
and
malta
watched
her
attentively
from
her
corner
one
day
miss
laura
stood
at
the
window
looking
out
into
the
garden
malta
was
lying
on
the
platform
staring
at
the
sparrows
that
were
picking
up
crumbs
from
the
ground
she
trembled
and
half
rose
every
few
minutes
as
if
to
go
after
them
then
she
lay
down
again
she
was
trying
very
hard
not
to
creep
on
them
presently
a
neighbor
cat
came
stealing
along
the
fence
keeping
one
eye
on
malta
and
the
other
on
the
sparrows
malta
was
so
angry
she
sprang
up
and
chased
her
away
and
then
came
back
to
the
platform
where
she
lay
down
again
and
waited
for
the
sparrows
to
come
back
for
a
long
time
she
stayed
there
and
never
once
tried
to
catch
them
miss
laura
was
so
pleased
she
went
to
the
door
and
said
softly
come
here
malta
the
cat
put
up
her
tail
and
meowing
gently
came
into
the
house
miss
laura
took
her
up
in
her
arms
and
going
down
to
the
kitchen
asked
mary
to
give
her
a
saucer
of
her
very
sweetest
milk
for
the
best
cat
in
the
united
states
of
america
malta
got
great
praise
for
this
and
i
never
knew
of
her
catching
a
bird
afterward
she
was
well
fed
in
the
house
and
had
no
need
to
hurt
such
harmless
creatures
she
was
very
fond
of
her
home
and
never
went
far
away
as
jim
and
i
did
once
when
willie
was
going
to
spend
a
few
weeks
with
a
little
friend
who
lived
fifty
miles
from
fairport
he
took
it
into
his
head
that
malta
should
go
with
him
his
mother
told
him
that
cats
did
not
like
to
go
away
from
home
but
he
said
he
would
be
good
to
her
and
begged
so
hard
to
take
her
that
at
last
his
mother
consented
he
had
been
a
few
days
in
this
place
when
he
wrote
home
to
say
that
malta
had
run
away
she
had
seemed
very
unhappy
and
though
he
had
kept
her
with
him
all
the
time
she
had
acted
as
if
she
wanted
to
get
away
when
the
letter
was
read
to
morris
he
said
malta
is
on
her
way
home
cats
have
a
wonderful
cleverness
in
finding
their
way
to
their
own
dwelling
she
will
be
very
tired
let
us
go
out
and
meet
her
willie
had
gone
to
this
place
in
a
coach
morris
got
a
buggy
and
took
miss
laura
and
me
with
him
and
we
started
out
we
went
slowly
along
the
road
every
little
while
miss
laura
blew
her
whistle
and
called
malta
malta
and
i
barked
as
loudly
as
i
could
morris
drove
for
several
hours
then
we
stopped
at
a
house
had
dinner
and
then
set
out
again
we
were
going
through
a
thick
wood
where
there
was
a
pretty
straight
road
when
i
saw
a
small
dark
creature
away
ahead
trotting
toward
us
it
was
malta
i
gave
a
joyful
bark
but
she
did
not
know
me
and
plunged
into
the
wood
i
ran
in
after
her
barking
and
yelping
and
miss
laura
blew
her
whistle
as
loudly
as
she
could
soon
there
was
a
little
gray
head
peeping
at
us
from
the
bushes
and
malta
bounded
out
gave
me
a
look
of
surprise
and
then
leaped
into
the
buggy
on
miss
laura
lap
what
a
happy
cat
she
was
she
purred
with
delight
and
licked
miss
laura
gloves
over
and
over
again
then
she
ate
the
food
they
had
brought
and
went
sound
asleep
she
was
very
thin
and
for
several
days
after
getting
home
she
slept
the
most
of
the
time
malta
did
not
like
dogs
but
she
was
very
good
to
cats
one
day
when
there
was
no
one
about
and
the
garden
was
very
quiet
i
saw
her
go
stealing
into
the
stable
and
come
out
again
followed
by
a
cat
that
had
been
deserted
by
some
people
that
lived
in
the
next
street
she
led
this
cat
up
to
her
catnip
bed
and
watched
her
kindly
while
she
rolled
and
rubbed
herself
in
it
then
malta
had
a
roll
in
it
herself
and
they
both
went
back
to
the
stable
catnip
is
a
favorite
plant
with
cats
and
miss
laura
always
kept
some
of
it
growing
for
malta
for
a
long
time
this
sick
cat
had
a
home
in
the
stable
malta
carried
her
food
every
day
and
after
a
time
miss
laura
found
out
about
her
and
did
what
she
could
to
make
her
well
in
time
she
got
to
be
a
strong
cat
and
miss
laura
got
a
home
for
her
with
an
invalid
lady
it
was
nothing
new
for
the
morrises
to
feed
deserted
cats
some
summers
morris
said
that
she
had
a
dozen
to
take
care
of
careless
and
cruel
people
would
go
away
for
the
summer
shutting
up
their
houses
and
making
no
provision
for
the
poor
cats
that
had
been
allowed
to
sit
snugly
by
the
fire
all
winter
at
last
morris
got
into
the
habit
of
putting
a
little
notice
in
the
fairport
paper
asking
people
who
were
going
away
for
the
summer
to
provide
for
their
cats
during
their
absence
chapter
xiii
the
beginning
of
an
adventure
the
first
winter
i
was
at
the
morrises
i
had
an
adventure
it
was
a
week
before
christmas
and
we
were
having
cold
frosty
weather
not
much
snow
had
fallen
but
there
was
plenty
of
skating
and
the
boys
were
off
every
day
with
their
skates
on
a
little
lake
near
fairport
jim
and
i
often
went
with
them
and
we
had
great
fun
scampering
over
the
ice
after
them
and
slipping
at
every
step
on
this
saturday
night
we
had
just
gotten
home
it
was
quite
dark
outside
and
there
was
a
cold
wind
blowing
so
when
we
came
in
the
front
door
and
saw
the
red
light
from
the
big
hall
stove
and
the
blazing
fire
in
the
parlor
they
looked
very
cheerful
i
was
quite
sorry
for
jim
that
he
had
to
go
out
to
his
kennel
however
he
said
he
did
mind
the
boys
got
a
plate
of
nice
warm
meat
for
him
and
a
bowl
of
milk
and
carried
them
out
and
afterward
he
went
to
sleep
jim
kennel
was
a
very
snug
one
being
a
spaniel
he
was
not
a
very
large
dog
but
his
kennel
was
as
roomy
as
if
he
was
a
great
dane
he
told
me
that
morris
and
the
boys
made
it
and
he
liked
it
very
much
because
it
was
large
enough
for
him
to
get
up
in
the
night
and
stretch
himself
when
he
got
tired
of
lying
in
one
position
it
was
raised
a
little
from
the
ground
and
it
had
a
thick
layer
of
straw
over
the
floor
above
was
a
broad
shelf
wide
enough
for
him
to
lie
on
and
covered
with
an
old
catskin
sleigh
robe
jim
always
slept
here
in
cold
weather
because
it
was
farther
away
from
the
ground
to
return
to
this
december
evening
i
can
remember
yet
how
hungry
i
was
i
could
scarcely
lie
still
till
miss
laura
finished
her
tea
morris
knowing
that
her
boys
would
be
very
hungry
had
mary
broil
some
beefsteak
and
roast
some
potatoes
for
them
and
did
they
smell
good
they
ate
all
the
steak
and
potatoes
it
did
matter
to
me
for
i
would
have
gotten
any
if
they
had
been
left
morris
could
not
afford
to
give
to
the
dogs
good
meat
that
she
had
gotten
for
her
children
so
she
used
to
get
the
butcher
to
send
her
liver
and
bones
and
tough
meat
and
mary
cooked
them
and
made
soup
and
broth
and
mixed
porridge
with
them
for
us
we
never
got
meat
three
times
a
day
miss
laura
said
it
was
all
very
well
to
feed
hunting
dogs
on
meat
but
dogs
that
are
kept
about
a
house
get
ill
if
they
are
fed
too
well
so
we
had
meat
only
once
a
day
and
bread
and
milk
porridge
or
dog
biscuits
for
our
other
meals
i
made
a
dreadful
noise
when
i
was
eating
ever
since
jenkins
cut
my
ears
off
i
had
had
trouble
in
breathing
the
flaps
had
kept
the
wind
and
dust
from
the
inside
of
my
ears
now
that
they
were
gone
my
head
was
stuffed
up
all
the
time
the
cold
weather
made
me
worse
and
sometimes
i
had
such
trouble
to
get
my
breath
that
it
seemed
as
if
i
would
choke
if
i
had
opened
my
mouth
and
breathed
through
it
as
i
have
seen
some
people
doing
i
would
have
been
more
comfortable
but
dogs
always
like
to
breathe
through
their
noses
you
have
taken
more
cold
said
miss
laura
this
night
as
she
put
my
plate
of
food
on
the
floor
for
me
finish
your
meat
and
then
come
and
sit
by
the
fire
with
me
what
do
you
want
more
i
gave
a
little
bark
so
she
filled
my
plate
for
the
second
time
miss
laura
never
allowed
any
one
to
meddle
with
us
when
we
were
eating
one
day
she
found
willie
teasing
me
by
snatching
at
a
bone
that
i
was
gnawing
willie
she
said
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
just
sitting
down
to
the
table
feeling
very
hungry
and
just
as
you
began
to
eat
your
meat
and
potatoes
i
would
come
along
and
snatch
the
plate
from
you
i
do
know
what
i
he
said
laughingly
but
i
to
wallop
you
well
she
said
i
afraid
that
joe
will
you
some
day
if
you
worry
him
about
his
food
for
even
a
gentle
dog
will
sometimes
snap
at
any
one
who
disturbs
him
at
his
meals
so
you
had
better
not
try
his
patience
too
far
willie
never
teased
me
after
that
and
i
was
very
glad
for
two
or
three
times
i
had
been
tempted
to
snarl
at
him
after
i
finished
my
tea
i
followed
miss
laura
upstairs
she
took
up
a
book
and
sat
down
in
a
low
chair
and
i
lay
down
on
the
hearth
rug
beside
her
do
you
know
joe
she
said
with
a
smile
why
you
scratch
with
your
paws
when
you
lie
down
as
if
to
make
yourself
a
hollow
bed
and
turn
around
a
great
many
times
before
you
lie
down
of
course
i
did
not
know
so
i
only
stared
at
her
years
and
years
ago
she
went
on
gazing
down
at
me
there
were
any
dogs
living
in
people
houses
as
you
are
joe
they
were
all
wild
creatures
running
about
the
woods
they
always
scratched
among
the
leaves
to
make
a
comfortable
bed
for
themselves
and
the
habit
has
come
down
to
you
joe
for
you
are
descended
from
them
this
sounded
very
interesting
and
i
think
she
was
going
to
tell
me
some
more
about
my
wild
forefathers
but
just
then
the
rest
of
the
family
came
in
i
always
thought
that
this
was
the
snuggest
time
of
the
day
when
the
family
all
sat
around
the
fire
morris
sewing
the
boys
reading
or
studying
and
morris
with
his
head
buried
in
a
newspaper
and
billy
and
i
on
the
floor
at
their
feet
this
evening
i
was
feeling
very
drowsy
and
had
almost
dropped
asleep
when
ned
gave
me
a
push
with
his
foot
he
was
a
great
tease
and
he
delighted
in
getting
me
to
make
a
simpleton
of
myself
i
tried
to
keep
my
eyes
on
the
fire
but
i
could
not
and
just
had
to
turn
and
look
at
him
he
was
holding
his
book
up
between
himself
and
his
mother
and
was
opening
his
mouth
as
wide
as
he
could
and
throwing
back
his
head
pretending
to
howl
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
help
giving
a
loud
howl
morris
looked
up
and
said
bad
joe
keep
still
the
boys
were
all
laughing
behind
their
books
for
they
knew
what
ned
was
doing
presently
he
started
off
again
and
i
was
just
beginning
another
howl
that
might
have
made
morris
send
me
out
of
the
room
when
the
door
opened
and
a
young
girl
called
bessie
drury
came
in
she
had
a
cap
on
and
a
shawl
thrown
over
her
shoulders
and
she
had
just
run
across
the
street
from
her
father
house
oh
morris
she
said
will
you
let
laura
come
over
and
stay
with
me
mamma
has
just
gotten
a
telegram
from
bangor
saying
that
her
aunt
cole
is
very
ill
and
she
wants
to
see
her
and
papa
is
going
to
take
her
there
by
train
and
she
is
afraid
i
will
be
lonely
if
i
do
have
laura
can
you
not
come
and
spend
the
night
here
said
morris
no
thank
you
i
think
mamma
would
rather
have
me
stay
in
our
house
very
well
said
morris
i
think
laura
would
like
to
go
yes
indeed
said
miss
laura
smiling
at
her
friend
i
will
come
over
in
half
an
hour
thank
you
so
much
said
miss
bessie
and
she
hurried
away
after
she
left
morris
looked
up
from
his
paper
there
will
be
some
one
in
the
house
besides
those
two
girls
oh
yes
said
morris
drury
has
her
old
nurse
who
has
been
with
her
for
twenty
years
and
there
are
two
maids
besides
and
donald
the
coachman
who
sleeps
over
the
stable
so
they
are
well
protected
very
good
said
morris
and
he
went
back
to
his
paper
of
course
dumb
animals
do
not
understand
all
that
they
hear
spoken
of
but
i
think
human
beings
would
be
astonished
if
they
knew
how
much
we
can
gather
from
their
looks
and
voices
i
knew
that
morris
did
not
quite
like
the
idea
of
having
his
daughter
go
to
the
drury
when
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
house
were
away
so
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
go
with
her
when
she
came
down
stairs
with
her
little
satchel
on
her
arm
i
got
up
and
stood
beside
her
dear
old
joe
she
said
you
must
not
come
i
pushed
myself
out
the
door
beside
her
after
she
had
kissed
her
mother
and
father
and
the
boys
go
back
joe
she
said
firmly
i
had
to
step
back
then
but
i
cried
and
whined
and
she
looked
at
me
in
astonishment
i
will
be
back
in
the
morning
joe
she
said
gently
do
squeal
in
that
way
then
she
shut
the
door
and
went
out
i
felt
dreadfully
i
walked
up
and
down
the
floor
and
ran
to
the
window
and
howled
without
having
to
look
at
ned
morris
peered
over
her
glasses
at
me
in
utter
surprise
boys
she
said
did
you
ever
see
joe
act
in
that
way
before
no
mother
they
all
said
morris
was
looking
at
me
very
intently
he
had
always
taken
more
notice
of
me
than
any
other
creature
about
the
house
and
i
was
very
fond
of
him
now
i
ran
up
and
put
my
paws
on
his
knees
mother
he
said
turning
to
his
wife
let
the
dog
go
very
well
she
said
in
a
puzzled
way
jack
just
run
over
with
him
and
tell
drury
how
he
is
acting
and
that
i
will
be
very
much
obliged
if
she
will
let
him
stay
all
night
with
laura
jack
sprang
up
seized
his
cap
and
raced
down
the
front
steps
across
the
street
through
the
gate
and
up
the
gravelled
walk
where
the
little
stones
were
all
hard
and
fast
in
the
frost
the
drurys
lived
in
a
large
white
house
with
trees
all
around
it
and
a
garden
at
the
back
they
were
rich
people
and
had
a
great
deal
of
company
through
the
summer
i
had
often
seen
carriages
at
the
door
and
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
light
clothes
walking
over
the
lawn
and
sometimes
i
smelled
nice
things
they
were
having
to
eat
they
did
not
keep
any
dogs
nor
pets
of
any
kind
so
jim
and
i
never
had
an
excuse
to
call
there
jack
and
i
were
soon
at
the
front
door
and
he
rang
the
bell
and
gave
me
in
charge
of
the
maid
who
opened
it
the
girl
listened
to
his
message
for
drury
then
she
walked
upstairs
smiling
and
looking
at
me
over
her
shoulder
there
was
a
trunk
in
the
upper
hall
and
an
elderly
woman
was
putting
things
in
it
a
lady
stood
watching
her
and
when
she
saw
me
she
gave
a
little
scream
oh
nurse
look
at
that
horrid
dog
where
did
he
come
from
put
him
out
susan
i
stood
quite
still
and
the
girl
who
had
brought
me
upstairs
gave
her
jack
message
certainly
certainly
said
the
lady
when
the
maid
finished
speaking
if
he
is
one
of
the
morris
dogs
he
is
sure
to
be
a
one
tell
the
little
boy
to
thank
his
mamma
for
letting
laura
come
over
and
say
that
we
will
keep
the
dog
with
pleasure
now
nurse
we
must
hurry
the
cab
will
be
here
in
five
minutes
i
walked
softly
into
a
front
room
and
there
i
found
my
dear
miss
laura
miss
bessie
was
with
her
and
they
were
cramming
things
into
a
portmanteau
they
both
ran
out
to
find
out
how
i
came
there
and
just
then
a
gentleman
came
hurriedly
upstairs
and
said
the
cab
had
come
there
was
a
scene
of
great
confusion
and
hurry
but
in
a
few
minutes
it
was
all
over
the
cab
had
rolled
away
and
the
house
was
quiet
nurse
you
must
be
tired
you
had
better
go
to
bed
said
miss
bessie
turning
to
the
elderly
woman
as
we
all
stood
in
the
hall
susan
will
you
bring
some
supper
to
the
for
miss
morris
and
me
what
will
you
have
laura
what
are
you
going
to
have
asked
miss
laura
with
a
smile
hot
chocolate
and
tea
biscuits
then
i
will
have
the
same
bring
some
cake
too
susan
said
miss
bessie
and
something
for
the
dog
i
dare
say
he
would
like
some
of
that
turkey
that
was
left
from
dinner
if
i
had
had
any
ears
i
would
have
pricked
them
up
at
this
for
i
was
very
fond
of
fowl
and
i
never
got
any
at
the
morrises
unless
it
might
be
a
stray
bone
or
two
what
fun
we
had
over
our
supper
the
two
girls
sat
at
the
big
dining
table
and
sipped
their
chocolate
and
laughed
and
talked
and
i
had
the
skeleton
of
a
whole
turkey
on
a
newspaper
that
susan
spread
on
the
carpet
i
was
very
careful
not
to
drag
it
about
and
miss
bessie
laughed
at
me
till
the
tears
came
in
her
eyes
that
dog
is
a
gentleman
she
said
see
how
he
holds
bones
on
the
paper
with
his
paws
and
strips
the
meat
off
with
his
teeth
oh
joe
joe
you
are
a
funny
dog
and
you
are
having
a
funny
supper
i
have
heard
of
quail
on
toast
but
i
never
heard
of
turkey
on
newspaper
had
we
better
go
to
bed
said
miss
laura
when
the
hall
clock
struck
eleven
yes
i
suppose
we
had
said
miss
bessie
where
is
this
animal
to
sleep
i
do
know
said
miss
laura
he
sleeps
in
the
stable
at
home
or
in
the
kennel
with
jim
suppose
susan
makes
him
a
nice
bed
by
the
kitchen
stove
said
miss
bessie
susan
made
the
bed
but
i
was
not
willing
to
sleep
in
it
i
barked
so
loudly
when
they
shut
me
up
alone
that
they
had
to
let
me
go
upstairs
with
them
miss
laura
was
almost
angry
with
me
but
i
could
not
help
it
i
had
come
over
there
to
protect
her
and
i
was
going
to
leave
her
if
i
could
help
it
miss
bessie
had
a
handsomely
furnished
room
with
a
soft
carpet
on
the
floor
and
pretty
curtains
at
the
windows
there
were
two
single
beds
in
it
and
the
two
girls
dragged
them
close
together
so
that
they
could
talk
after
they
got
in
bed
before
miss
bessie
put
out
the
light
she
told
miss
laura
not
to
be
alarmed
if
she
heard
any
one
walking
about
in
the
night
for
the
nurse
was
sleeping
across
the
hall
from
them
and
she
would
probably
come
in
once
or
twice
to
see
if
they
were
sleeping
comfortably
the
two
girls
talked
for
a
long
time
and
then
they
fell
asleep
just
before
miss
laura
dropped
off
she
forgave
me
and
put
down
her
hand
for
me
to
lick
as
i
lay
on
a
fur
rug
close
by
her
bed
i
was
very
tired
and
i
had
a
very
soft
and
pleasant
bed
so
i
soon
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
but
i
waked
up
at
the
slightest
noise
once
miss
laura
turned
in
bed
and
another
time
miss
bessie
laughed
in
her
sleep
and
again
there
were
queer
crackling
noises
in
the
frosty
limbs
of
the
trees
outside
that
made
me
start
up
quickly
out
of
my
sleep
there
was
a
big
clock
in
the
hall
and
every
time
it
struck
i
waked
up
once
just
after
it
had
struck
some
hour
i
jumped
up
out
of
a
sound
nap
i
had
been
dreaming
about
my
early
home
jenkins
was
after
me
with
a
whip
and
my
limbs
were
quivering
and
trembling
as
if
i
had
been
trying
to
get
away
from
him
i
sprang
up
and
shook
myself
then
i
took
a
turn
around
the
room
the
two
girls
were
breathing
gently
i
could
scarcely
hear
them
i
walked
to
the
door
and
looked
out
into
the
hall
there
was
a
dim
light
burning
there
the
door
of
the
nurse
room
stood
open
i
went
quietly
to
it
and
looked
in
she
was
breathing
heavily
and
muttering
in
her
sleep
i
went
back
to
my
rug
and
tried
to
go
to
sleep
but
i
could
not
such
an
uneasy
feeling
was
upon
me
that
i
had
to
keep
walking
about
i
went
out
into
the
hall
again
and
stood
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
i
thought
i
would
take
a
walk
through
the
lower
hall
and
then
go
to
bed
again
the
drurys
carpets
were
all
like
velvet
and
my
paws
did
not
make
a
rattling
on
them
as
they
did
on
the
oil
cloth
at
the
morrises
i
crept
down
the
stairs
like
a
cat
and
walked
along
the
lower
hall
smelling
under
all
the
doors
listening
as
i
went
there
was
no
night
light
burning
down
here
and
it
was
quite
dark
but
if
there
had
been
any
strange
person
about
i
would
have
smelled
him
i
was
surprised
when
i
got
near
the
farther
end
of
the
hall
to
see
a
tiny
gleam
of
light
shine
for
an
instant
from
under
the
door
then
it
went
away
again
the
was
the
place
to
eat
surely
none
of
the
people
in
the
house
would
be
there
after
the
supper
we
had
i
went
and
sniffed
under
the
door
there
was
a
smell
there
a
strong
smell
like
beggars
and
poor
people
it
smelled
like
jenkins
it
jenkins
chapter
xiv
how
we
caught
the
burglar
what
was
the
wretch
doing
in
the
house
with
my
dear
miss
laura
i
thought
i
would
go
crazy
i
scratched
at
the
door
and
barked
and
yelped
i
sprang
up
on
it
and
though
i
was
quite
a
heavy
dog
by
this
time
i
felt
as
light
as
a
feather
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
would
go
mad
if
i
could
not
get
that
door
open
every
few
seconds
i
stopped
and
put
my
head
down
to
the
doorsill
to
listen
there
was
a
rushing
about
inside
the
room
and
a
chair
fell
over
and
some
one
seemed
to
be
getting
out
of
the
window
this
made
me
worse
than
ever
i
did
not
stop
to
think
that
i
was
only
a
dog
and
that
jenkins
would
probably
kill
me
if
he
got
his
hands
on
me
i
was
so
furious
that
i
thought
only
of
getting
hold
of
him
in
the
midst
of
the
noise
that
i
made
there
was
a
screaming
and
a
rushing
to
and
fro
upstairs
i
ran
up
and
down
the
hall
and
up
the
steps
and
back
again
i
did
not
want
miss
laura
to
come
down
but
how
was
i
to
make
her
understand
there
she
was
in
her
white
gown
leaning
over
the
railing
and
holding
back
her
long
hair
her
face
a
picture
of
surprise
and
alarm
the
dog
has
gone
mad
screamed
miss
bessie
nurse
pour
a
pitcher
of
water
on
him
the
nurse
was
more
sensible
she
ran
downstairs
her
flying
and
a
blanket
that
she
had
seized
from
her
bed
trailing
behind
her
there
are
thieves
in
the
house
she
shouted
at
the
top
of
her
voice
and
the
dog
has
found
it
out
she
did
not
go
near
the
door
but
threw
open
the
front
one
crying
policeman
policeman
help
help
thieves
murder
such
a
screaming
as
that
old
woman
made
she
was
worse
than
i
was
i
dashed
by
her
out
through
the
hall
door
and
away
down
to
the
gate
where
i
heard
some
one
running
i
gave
a
few
loud
yelps
to
call
jim
and
leaped
the
gate
as
the
man
before
me
had
done
there
was
something
savage
in
me
that
night
i
think
it
must
have
been
the
smell
of
jenkins
i
felt
as
if
i
could
tear
him
to
pieces
i
have
never
felt
so
wicked
since
i
was
hunting
him
as
he
had
hunted
me
and
my
mother
and
the
thought
gave
me
pleasure
old
jim
soon
caught
up
with
me
and
i
gave
him
a
push
with
my
nose
to
let
him
know
i
was
glad
he
had
come
we
rushed
swiftly
on
and
at
the
corner
caught
up
with
the
miserable
man
who
was
running
away
from
us
i
gave
an
angry
growl
and
jumping
up
bit
at
his
leg
he
turned
around
and
though
it
was
not
a
very
bright
night
there
was
light
enough
for
me
to
see
the
ugly
face
of
my
old
master
he
seemed
so
angry
to
think
that
jim
and
i
dared
to
snap
at
him
he
caught
up
a
handful
of
stones
and
with
some
bad
words
threw
them
at
us
just
then
away
in
front
of
us
was
a
queer
whistle
and
then
another
one
like
it
behind
us
jenkins
made
a
strange
noise
in
his
throat
and
started
to
run
down
a
side
street
away
from
the
direction
of
the
two
whistles
i
was
afraid
that
he
was
going
to
get
away
and
though
i
could
not
hold
him
i
kept
springing
up
on
him
and
once
i
tripped
him
up
oh
how
furious
he
was
he
kicked
me
against
the
side
of
a
wall
and
gave
me
two
or
three
hard
blows
with
a
stick
that
he
caught
up
and
kept
throwing
stones
at
me
i
would
not
give
up
though
i
could
scarcely
see
him
for
the
blood
that
was
running
over
my
eyes
old
jim
got
so
angry
whenever
jenkins
touched
me
that
he
ran
up
behind
and
nipped
his
calves
to
make
him
turn
on
him
soon
jenkins
came
to
a
high
wall
where
he
stopped
and
with
a
hurried
look
behind
began
to
climb
over
it
the
wall
was
too
high
for
me
to
jump
he
was
going
to
escape
what
shall
i
do
i
barked
as
loudly
as
i
could
for
some
one
to
come
and
then
sprang
up
and
held
him
by
the
leg
as
he
was
getting
over
i
had
such
a
grip
that
i
went
over
the
wall
with
him
and
left
jim
on
the
other
side
jenkins
fell
on
his
face
in
the
earth
then
he
got
up
and
with
a
look
of
deadly
hatred
on
his
face
pounced
upon
me
if
help
had
not
come
i
think
he
would
have
dashed
out
my
brains
against
the
wall
as
he
dashed
out
my
poor
little
brothers
against
the
stall
but
just
then
there
was
a
running
sound
two
men
came
down
the
street
and
sprang
upon
the
wall
just
where
jim
was
leaping
up
and
down
and
barking
in
distress
i
saw
at
once
by
their
uniform
and
the
clubs
in
their
hands
that
they
were
policemen
in
one
short
instant
they
had
hold
of
jenkins
he
gave
up
then
but
he
stood
snarling
at
me
like
an
ugly
dog
if
it
been
for
that
cur
i
never
a
been
caught
why
and
he
staggered
back
and
uttered
a
bad
word
it
me
own
dog
more
shame
to
you
said
one
of
the
policemen
sternly
what
have
you
been
up
to
at
this
time
of
night
to
have
your
own
dog
and
a
quiet
minister
spaniel
dog
a
chasing
you
through
the
street
jenkins
began
to
swear
and
would
not
tell
them
anything
there
was
a
house
in
the
garden
and
just
at
this
minute
some
one
opened
a
window
and
called
out
hallo
there
what
are
you
doing
we
catching
a
thief
sir
said
one
of
the
policemen
leastwise
i
think
that
what
he
been
up
to
could
you
throw
us
down
a
bit
of
rope
we
no
handcuffs
here
and
one
of
us
has
to
go
to
the
and
the
other
to
washington
street
where
there
a
woman
yelling
blue
murder
and
hurry
up
please
sir
the
gentleman
threw
down
a
rope
and
in
two
minutes
jenkins
wrists
were
tied
together
and
he
was
walked
through
the
gate
saying
bad
words
as
fast
as
he
could
to
the
policeman
who
was
leading
him
good
dogs
said
the
other
policeman
to
jim
and
me
then
he
ran
up
the
street
and
we
followed
him
as
we
hurried
along
washington
street
and
came
near
our
house
we
saw
lights
gleaming
through
the
darkness
and
heard
people
running
to
and
fro
the
nurse
shrieking
had
alarmed
the
neighborhood
the
morris
boys
were
all
out
in
the
street
only
half
clad
and
shivering
with
cold
and
the
drurys
coachman
with
no
hat
on
and
his
hair
sticking
up
all
over
his
head
was
running
about
with
a
lantern
the
neighbors
houses
were
all
lighted
up
and
a
good
many
people
were
hanging
out
of
their
windows
and
opening
their
doors
and
calling
to
each
other
to
know
what
all
this
noise
meant
when
the
policeman
appeared
with
jim
and
me
at
his
heels
quite
a
crowd
gathered
around
him
to
hear
his
part
of
the
story
jim
and
i
dropped
on
the
ground
panting
as
hard
as
we
could
and
with
little
streams
of
water
running
from
our
tongues
we
were
both
pretty
well
used
up
jim
back
was
bleeding
in
several
places
from
the
stones
that
jenkins
had
thrown
at
him
and
i
was
a
mass
of
bruises
presently
we
were
discovered
and
then
what
a
fuss
was
made
over
us
brave
dogs
noble
dogs
everybody
said
and
patted
and
praised
us
we
were
very
proud
and
happy
and
stood
up
and
wagged
our
tails
at
least
jim
did
and
i
wagged
what
i
could
then
they
found
what
a
state
we
were
in
morris
cried
and
catching
me
up
in
her
arms
ran
in
the
house
with
me
and
jack
followed
with
old
jim
we
all
went
into
the
parlor
there
was
a
good
fire
there
and
miss
laura
and
miss
bessie
were
sitting
over
it
they
sprang
up
when
they
saw
us
and
right
there
in
the
parlor
washed
our
wounds
and
made
us
lie
down
by
the
fire
you
saved
our
silver
brave
joe
said
miss
bessie
just
wait
till
my
papa
and
mamma
come
home
and
see
what
they
will
say
well
jack
what
is
the
latest
as
the
morris
boys
came
trooping
into
the
room
the
policeman
has
been
questioning
your
nurse
and
examining
the
and
has
gone
down
to
the
station
to
make
his
report
and
do
you
know
what
he
has
found
out
said
jack
excitedly
no
what
asked
miss
bessie
why
that
villain
was
going
to
burn
your
house
miss
bessie
gave
a
little
shriek
why
what
do
you
mean
well
said
jack
they
think
by
what
they
discovered
that
he
planned
to
pack
his
bag
with
silver
and
carry
it
off
but
just
before
he
did
so
he
would
pour
oil
around
the
room
and
set
fire
to
it
so
people
would
not
find
out
that
he
had
been
robbing
you
why
we
might
have
all
been
burned
to
death
said
miss
bessie
he
could
burn
the
without
setting
fire
to
the
rest
of
the
house
certainly
not
said
jack
that
shows
what
a
villain
he
is
do
they
know
this
for
certain
jack
asked
miss
laura
well
they
suppose
so
they
found
some
bottles
of
oil
along
with
the
bag
he
had
for
the
silver
how
horrible
you
darling
old
joe
perhaps
you
saved
our
lives
and
pretty
miss
bessie
kissed
my
ugly
swollen
head
i
could
do
nothing
but
lick
her
little
hand
but
always
after
that
i
thought
a
great
deal
of
her
it
is
now
some
years
since
all
this
happened
and
i
might
as
well
tell
the
end
of
it
the
next
day
the
drurys
came
home
and
everything
was
found
out
about
jenkins
the
night
they
left
fairport
he
had
been
hanging
about
the
station
he
knew
just
who
were
left
in
the
house
for
he
had
once
supplied
them
with
milk
and
knew
all
about
their
family
he
had
no
customers
at
this
time
for
after
harry
rescued
me
and
that
piece
came
out
in
the
paper
about
him
he
found
that
no
one
would
take
milk
from
him
his
wife
died
and
some
kind
people
put
his
children
in
an
asylum
and
he
was
obliged
to
sell
toby
and
the
cows
instead
of
learning
a
lesson
from
all
this
and
leading
a
better
life
he
kept
sinking
lower
he
was
therefore
ready
for
any
kind
of
mischief
that
turned
up
and
when
he
saw
the
drurys
going
away
in
the
train
he
thought
he
would
steal
a
bag
of
silver
from
their
sideboard
then
set
fire
to
the
house
and
run
away
and
hide
the
silver
after
a
time
he
would
take
it
to
some
city
and
sell
it
he
was
made
to
confess
all
this
then
for
his
wickedness
he
was
sent
to
prison
for
ten
years
and
i
hope
he
will
get
to
be
a
better
man
there
and
be
one
after
he
comes
out
i
was
sore
and
stiff
for
a
long
time
and
one
day
drury
came
over
to
see
me
she
did
not
love
dogs
as
the
morrises
did
she
tried
to
but
she
could
not
dogs
can
see
fun
in
things
as
well
as
people
can
and
i
buried
my
muzzle
in
the
so
that
she
would
not
see
how
i
was
curling
up
my
lip
and
smiling
at
her
you
are
a
good
dog
she
said
slowly
you
are
then
she
stopped
and
could
not
think
of
anything
else
to
say
to
me
i
got
up
and
stood
in
front
of
her
for
a
dog
should
not
lie
down
when
a
lady
speaks
to
him
i
wagged
my
body
a
little
and
i
would
gladly
have
said
something
to
help
her
out
of
her
difficulty
but
i
could
if
she
had
stroked
me
it
might
have
helped
her
but
she
did
want
to
touch
me
and
i
knew
she
did
want
me
to
touch
her
so
i
just
stood
looking
at
her
morris
she
said
turning
from
me
with
a
puzzled
face
i
like
animals
and
i
ca
pretend
to
for
they
always
find
me
out
but
ca
you
let
that
dog
know
that
i
shall
feel
eternally
grateful
to
him
for
saving
not
only
our
property
for
that
is
a
trifle
but
my
darling
daughter
from
fright
and
annoyance
and
a
possible
injury
or
loss
of
life
i
think
he
understands
said
morris
he
is
a
very
wise
dog
and
smiling
in
great
amusement
she
called
me
to
her
and
put
my
paws
on
her
lap
look
at
that
lady
joe
she
is
pleased
with
you
for
driving
jenkins
away
from
her
house
you
remember
jenkins
i
barked
angrily
and
limped
to
the
window
how
intelligent
he
is
said
drury
my
husband
has
sent
to
new
york
for
a
watchdog
and
he
says
that
from
this
on
our
house
shall
never
be
without
one
now
i
must
go
your
dog
is
happy
morris
and
i
can
do
nothing
for
him
except
to
say
that
i
shall
never
forget
him
and
i
wish
he
would
come
over
occasionally
to
see
us
perhaps
when
we
get
our
dog
he
will
i
shall
tell
my
cook
whenever
she
sees
him
to
give
him
something
to
eat
this
is
a
souvenir
for
laura
of
that
dreadful
night
i
feel
under
a
deep
obligation
to
you
so
i
am
sure
you
will
allow
her
to
accept
it
then
she
gave
morris
a
little
box
and
went
away
when
miss
laura
came
in
she
opened
the
box
and
found
in
it
a
handsome
diamond
ring
on
the
inside
of
it
was
engraved
laura
in
memory
of
december
from
her
grateful
friend
bessie
the
diamond
was
worth
hundreds
of
dollars
and
morris
told
miss
laura
that
she
had
rather
she
would
not
wear
it
then
while
she
was
a
young
girl
it
was
not
suitable
for
her
and
she
knew
drury
did
not
expect
her
to
do
so
she
wished
to
give
her
a
valuable
present
and
this
would
always
be
worth
a
great
deal
of
money
chapter
xv
our
journey
to
riverdale
every
other
summer
the
morris
children
were
sent
to
some
place
in
the
country
so
that
they
could
have
a
change
of
air
and
see
what
country
life
was
like
as
there
were
so
many
of
them
they
usually
went
different
ways
the
summer
after
i
came

to
an
uncle
in
vermont

a
lovely
place
in

and
many
people
came
there

some
of
their
pets
with
them
and
the
others
they
left
at
home
for
their
mother
to
take
care
of
she
never
allowed
them
to
take
a
pet
animal
anywhere
unless
she
knew
it
would
be
perfectly
welcome
do
let
your
pets
be
a
worry
to
other
people
she
often
said
to
them
or
they
will
dislike
them
and
you
too
miss
laura
went
away
earlier
than
the
others
for
she
had
run
down
through
the
spring
and
was
pale
and
thin
one
day
early
in
june
we
set
out
i
say
we
for
after

should
never
be
parted
from
her
if
any
one
invited
her
to
come
and
see
them
and
did
want
me
she
would
stay
at
home

to
the
station

see
us

her
purse
then
i
was
put
in
a
baggage
car
and
chained
in
a
corner
i
heard
morris
say
that
as
we
were
only
going
a
short
distance
it
was
not
worth
while
to
get
an
express
ticket
for
me
there
was
a
dreadful
noise
and
bustle
at
the
station
whistles
were
blowing
and
people
were
rushing
up
and
down
the
platform
some
men
were
tumbling
baggage
so
fast
into
the
car
where
i
was
that
i
was
afraid
some
of
it
would
fall
on
me
for
a
few
minutes
miss
laura
stood
by
the
door
and
looked
in
but
soon
the
men
had
piled
up
so
many
boxes
and
trunks
that
she
could
not
see
me
then
she
went
away
morris
asked
one
of
the
men
to
see
that
i
did
not
get
hurt
and
i
heard
some
money
rattle
then
he
went
away
too
it
was
the
beginning
of
june
and
the
weather
had
suddenly
become
very
hot
we
had
a
long
cold
spring
and
not
being
used
to
the
heat
it
seemed
very
hard
to
bear
before
the
train
started
the
doors
of
the
baggage
car
were
closed
and
it
became
quite
dark
inside
the
darkness
and
the
heat
and
the
close
smell
and
the
noise
as
we
went
rushing
along
made
me
feel
sick
and
frightened
i
did
not
dare
to
lie
down
but
sat
up
trembling
and
wishing
that
we
might
soon
come
to
riverdale
station
but
we
did
not
get
there
for
some
time
and
i
was
to
have
a
great
fright
i
was
thinking
of
all
the
stories
that
i
knew
of
animals
traveling
in
february
the
drurys
newfoundland
pluto
had
arrived
from
new
york
and
he
told
jim
and
me
that
he
had
a
miserable
journey
a
gentleman
friend
of
drury
had
brought
him
from
new
york
he
saw
him
chained
up
in
his
car
and
he
went
into
his
pullman
first
tipping
the
handsomely
to
look
after
him
pluto
said
that
the
had
a
very
red
nose
and
he
was
always
getting
drinks
for
himself
when
they
stopped
at
a
station
but
he
never
once
gave
him
a
drink
or
anything
to
eat
from
the
time
they
left
new
york
till
they
got
to
fairport
when
the
train
stopped
there
and
pluto
chain
was
unfastened
he
sprang
out
on
the
platform
and
nearly
knocked
drury
down
he
saw
some
snow
that
had
sifted
through
the
station
roof
and
he
was
so
thirsty
that
he
began
to
lick
it
up
when
the
snow
was
all
gone
he
jumped
up
and
licked
the
frost
on
the
windows
drury
friend
was
so
angry
he
found
the
and
said
to
him
what
did
you
mean
by
coming
into
my
car
every
few
hours
to
tell
me
that
the
dog
was
fed
and
watered
and
comfortable
i
shall
report
you
he
went
into
the
office
at
the
station
and
complained
of
the
man
and
was
told
that
he
was
a
drinking
man
and
was
going
to
be
dismissed
i
was
not
afraid
of
suffering
like
pluto
because
it
was
only
going
to
take
us
a
few
hours
to
get
to
riverdale
i
found
that
we
always
went
slowly
before
we
came
in
to
a
station
and
one
time
when
we
began
to
slacken
speed
i
thought
that
surely
we
must
be
at
our
journey
end
however
it
was
not
riverdale
the
car
gave
a
kind
of
jump
then
there
was
a
crashing
sound
ahead
and
we
stopped
i
heard
men
shouting
and
running
up
and
down
and
i
wondered
what
had
happened
it
was
all
dark
and
still
in
the
car
and
nobody
came
in
but
the
noise
kept
up
outside
and
i
knew
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
train
perhaps
miss
laura
had
got
hurt
something
must
have
happened
to
her
or
she
would
come
to
me
i
barked
and
pulled
at
my
chain
till
my
neck
was
sore
but
for
a
long
long
time
i
was
there
alone
the
men
running
about
outside
must
have
heard
me
if
ever
i
hear
a
man
in
trouble
and
crying
for
help
i
go
to
him
and
see
what
he
wants
after
such
a
long
time
that
it
seemed
to
me
it
must
be
the
middle
of
the
night
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
car
opened
and
a
man
looked
in
this
is
all
through
baggage
for
new
york
miss
i
heard
him
say
they
would
put
your
dog
in
here
yes
they
did
i
am
sure
this
is
the
car
i
heard
in
the
voice
i
knew
so
well
and
wo
you
get
him
out
please
he
must
be
terribly
frightened
the
man
stooped
down
and
unfastened
my
chain
grumbling
to
himself
because
i
had
not
been
put
in
another
car
some
folks
tumble
a
dog
round
as
if
he
was
a
junk
of
coal
he
said
patting
me
kindly
i
was
nearly
wild
with
delight
to
get
with
miss
laura
again
but
i
had
barked
so
much
and
pressed
my
neck
so
hard
with
my
collar
that
my
voice
was
all
gone
i
fawned
on
her
and
wagged
myself
about
and
opened
and
shut
my
mouth
but
no
sound
came
out
of
it
it
made
miss
laura
nervous
she
tried
to
laugh
and
cry
at
the
same
time
and
then
bit
her
lip
hard
and
said
oh
joe
do
he
lost
his
bark
has
he
said
the
man
looking
at
me
curiously
it
is
a
wicked
thing
to
confine
an
animal
in
a
dark
and
closed
car
said
miss
laura
trying
to
see
her
way
down
the
steps
through
her
tears
the
man
put
out
his
hand
and
helped
her
he
not
suffered
much
miss
he
said
do
you
distress
yourself
now
if
you
been
a
brakeman
on
a
chicago
train
as
i
was
a
few
years
ago
and
seen
the
animals
run
in
for
the
stock
yards
you
might
talk
about
cruelty
cars
that
ought
to
hold
a
certain
number
of
pigs
or
sheep
or
cattle
jammed
full
with
twice
as
many
and
half
of
thrown
out
choked
and
smothered
to
death
seen
a
man
running
up
and
down
raging
and
swearing
because
the
railway
people
had
let
him
get
in
to
tend
to
his
pigs
on
the
road
miss
laura
turned
and
looked
at
the
man
with
a
very
white
face
is
it
like
that
now
she
asked
no
no
he
said
hastily
it
better
now
they
got
new
regulations
about
taking
care
of
the
stock
but
mind
you
miss
the
cruelty
to
animals
is
all
done
on
the
railways
there
a
great
lot
of
dumb
creatures
suffering
all
round
everywhere
and
if
they
could
speak
be
a
hard
showing
for
some
other
people
besides
the
railway
men
he
lifted
his
cap
and
hurried
down
the
platform
and
miss
laura
her
face
very
much
troubled
picked
her
way
among
the
bits
of
coal
and
wood
scattered
about
the
platform
and
went
into
the
waiting
room
of
the
little
station
she
took
me
up
to
the
filter
and
let
some
water
run
in
her
hand
and
gave
it
to
me
to
lap
then
she
sat
down
and
i
leaned
my
head
against
her
knees
and
she
stroked
my
throat
gently
there
were
some
people
sitting
about
the
room
and
from
their
talk
i
found
out
what
had
taken
place
there
had
been
a
freight
train
on
a
side
track
at
this
station
waiting
for
us
to
get
by
the
switchman
had
carelessly
left
the
switch
open
after
this
train
went
by
and
when
we
came
along
afterward
our
train
instead
of
running
in
by
the
platform
went
crashing
into
the
freight
train
if
we
had
been
going
fast
great
damage
might
have
been
done
as
it
was
our
engine
was
smashed
so
badly
that
it
could
not
take
us
on
the
passengers
were
frightened
and
we
were
having
a
tedious
time
waiting
for
another
engine
to
come
and
take
us
to
riverdale
after
the
accident
the
trainmen
were
so
busy
that
miss
laura
could
get
no
one
to
release
me
while
i
sat
by
her
i
noticed
an
old
gentleman
staring
at
us
he
was
such
a
old
gentleman
he
looked
like
a
poodle
he
had
bright
brown
eyes
and
a
pointed
face
and
a
shock
of
white
hair
that
he
shook
every
few
minutes
he
sat
with
his
hands
clasped
on
the
top
of
his
cane
and
he
scarcely
took
his
eyes
from
miss
laura
face
suddenly
he
jumped
up
and
came
and
sat
down
beside
her
an
ugly
dog
that
he
said
pointing
to
me
most
young
ladies
would
have
resented
this
but
miss
laura
only
looked
amused
he
seems
beautiful
to
me
she
said
gently
h
because
he
your
dog
said
the
old
man
darting
a
sharp
look
at
me
what
the
matter
with
him
this
is
his
first
journey
by
rail
and
he
a
little
frightened
no
wonder
the
lord
only
knows
the
suffering
of
animals
in
transportation
said
the
old
gentleman
my
dear
young
lady
if
you
could
see
what
i
have
seen
you
never
eat
another
bit
of
meat
all
the
days
of
your
life
miss
laura
wrinkled
her
forehead
i
know
i
have
heard
she
faltered
it
must
be
terrible
terrible
it
awful
said
the
gentleman
think
of
the
cattle
on
the
western
plains
choked
with
thirst
in
summer
and
starved
and
frozen
in
winter
dehorned
and
goaded
on
to
trains
and
steamers
tossed
about
and
wounded
and
suffering
on
voyages
many
of
them
dying
and
being
thrown
into
the
sea
others
landed
sick
and
frightened
some
of
them
slaughtered
on
docks
and
wharves
to
keep
them
from
dropping
dead
in
their
tracks
what
kind
of
food
does
their
flesh
make
it
rank
poison
three
of
my
family
have
died
of
cancer
i
am
a
vegetarian
the
strange
old
gentleman
darted
from
his
seat
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
i
was
very
glad
he
had
gone
for
miss
laura
hated
to
hear
of
cruelty
of
any
kind
and
her
tears
were
dropping
thick
and
fast
on
my
brown
coat
the
gentleman
had
spoken
very
loudly
and
every
one
in
the
room
had
listened
to
what
he
said
among
them
was
a
very
young
man
with
a
cold
handsome
face
he
looked
as
if
he
was
annoyed
that
the
older
man
should
have
made
miss
laura
cry
do
you
think
sir
he
said
as
the
old
gentleman
passed
near
him
in
walking
up
and
down
the
floor
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
mock
sentiment
about
this
business
of
taking
care
of
the
dumb
creation
they
were
made
for
us
they
got
to
suffer
and
be
killed
to
supply
our
wants
the
cattle
and
sheep
and
other
animals
would
the
earth
if
we
did
kill
them
granted
said
the
old
man
stopping
right
in
front
of
him
granted
young
man
if
you
take
out
that
word
suffer
the
lord
made
the
sheep
and
the
cattle
and
the
pigs
they
are
his
creatures
just
as
much
as
we
are
we
can
kill
them
but
we
no
right
to
make
them
suffer
but
we
ca
help
it
sir
yes
we
can
my
young
man
it
a
possible
thing
to
raise
healthy
stock
treat
it
kindly
kill
it
mercifully
eat
it
decently
when
men
do
that
i
for
one
will
cease
to
be
a
vegetarian
you
only
a
boy
you
have
traveled
as
i
have
i
been
from
one
end
of
this
country
to
the
other
up
north
down
south
and
out
west
i
seen
sights
that
made
me
shudder
and
i
tell
you
the
lord
will
punish
this
great
american
nation
if
it
does
change
its
treatment
of
the
dumb
animals
committed
to
its
care
the
young
man
looked
thoughtful
and
did
not
reply
a
very
sweet
faced
old
lady
sitting
near
him
answered
the
old
gentleman
i
do
think
i
have
ever
seen
such
a
old
lady
as
she
was
her
hair
was
snowy
white
and
her
face
was
deeply
wrinkled
yet
she
was
tall
and
stately
and
her
expression
was
as
pleasing
as
my
dear
miss
laura
i
do
not
think
we
are
a
wicked
nation
she
said
softly
we
are
a
younger
nation
than
many
of
the
nations
of
the
earth
and
i
think
that
many
of
our
sins
arise
from
ignorance
and
thoughtlessness
yes
madame
yes
madame
said
the
fiery
old
gentleman
staring
hard
at
her
i
agree
with
you
there
she
smiled
very
pleasantly
at
him
and
went
on
i
too
have
been
a
traveler
and
i
have
talked
to
a
great
many
wise
and
good
people
on
the
subject
of
the
cruel
treatment
of
animals
and
i
find
that
many
of
them
have
never
thought
about
it
they
themselves
never
knowingly
a
dumb
creature
and
when
they
are
told
stories
of
inhuman
conduct
they
say
in
surprise
these
things
surely
ca
exist
you
see
they
have
never
been
brought
in
contact
with
them
as
soon
as
they
learn
about
them
they
begin
to
agitate
and
say
must
have
this
thing
stopped
where
is
the
remedy
and
what
is
it
what
is
it
madame
in
your
opinion
said
the
old
gentleman
pawing
the
floor
with
impatience
just
the
remedy
that
i
would
propose
for
the
great
evil
of
intemperance
said
the
old
lady
smiling
at
him
legislation
and
education
legislation
for
the
old
and
hardened
and
education
for
the
young
and
tender
i
would
tell
the
schoolboys
and
schoolgirls
that
alcohol
will
destroy
the
framework
of
their
beautiful
bodies
and
that
cruelty
to
any
of
god
living
creatures
will
blight
and
destroy
their
innocent
young
souls
the
young
man
spoke
again
do
you
think
he
said
that
you
temperance
and
humane
people
lay
too
much
stress
upon
the
education
of
our
youth
in
all
lofty
and
noble
sentiments
the
human
heart
will
always
be
wicked
your
bible
tells
you
that
does
it
you
ca
educate
all
the
badness
out
of
children
we
do
expect
to
do
that
said
the
old
lady
turning
her
pleasant
face
toward
him
but
even
if
the
human
heart
is
desperately
wicked
should
that
make
us
much
more
eager
to
try
to
educate
to
ennoble
and
restrain
however
as
far
as
my
experience
goes
and
i
have
lived
in
this
wicked
world
for
years
i
find
that
the
human
heart
though
wicked
and
cruel
as
you
say
has
yet
some
soft
and
tender
spots
and
the
impressions
made
upon
it
in
youth
are
never
never
effaced
do
you
not
remember
better
than
anything
else
standing
at
your
knee
the
pressure
of
her
hand
her
kiss
on
your
forehead
by
this
time
our
engine
had
arrived
a
whistle
was
blowing
and
nearly
every
one
was
rushing
from
the
room
the
impatient
old
gentleman
among
the
first
miss
laura
was
hurriedly
trying
to
do
up
her
shawl
strap
and
i
was
standing
by
wishing
that
i
could
help
her
the
old
lady
and
the
young
man
were
the
only
other
people
in
the
room
and
we
could
not
help
hearing
what
they
said
yes
i
do
he
said
in
a
thick
voice
and
his
face
got
very
red
she
is
dead
now
i
have
no
mother
poor
boy
and
the
old
lady
laid
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
they
were
standing
up
and
she
was
taller
than
he
was
may
god
bless
you
i
know
you
have
a
kind
heart
i
have
four
stalwart
boys
and
you
remind
me
of
the
youngest
if
you
are
ever
in
washington
come
to
see
me
she
gave
him
some
name
and
he
lifted
his
hat
and
looked
as
if
he
was
astonished
to
find
out
who
she
was
then
he
too
went
away
and
she
turned
to
miss
laura
shall
i
help
you
my
dear
if
you
please
said
my
young
mistress
i
ca
fasten
this
strap
in
a
few
seconds
the
bundle
was
done
up
and
we
were
joyfully
hastening
to
the
train
it
was
only
a
few
miles
to
riverdale
so
the
conductor
let
me
stay
in
the
car
with
miss
laura
she
spread
her
coat
out
on
the
seat
in
front
of
her
and
i
sat
on
it
and
looked
out
of
the
car
window
as
we
sped
along
through
a
lovely
country
all
green
and
fresh
in
the
june
sunlight
how
light
and
pleasant
this
car
was
so
different
from
the
baggage
car
what
frightens
an
animal
most
of
all
things
is
not
to
see
where
it
is
going
not
to
know
what
is
going
to
happen
to
it
i
think
that
they
are
very
like
human
beings
in
this
respect
the
lady
had
taken
a
seat
beside
miss
laura
and
as
we
went
along
she
too
looked
out
of
the
window
and
said
in
a
low
voice
what
is
so
rare
as
a
day
in
june
then
if
ever
come
perfect
days
that
is
very
true
said
miss
laura
how
sad
that
the
autumn
must
come
and
the
cold
winter
no
my
dear
not
sad
it
is
but
a
preparation
for
another
summer
yes
i
suppose
it
is
said
miss
laura
then
she
continued
a
little
shyly
as
her
companion
leaned
over
to
stroke
my
cropped
ears
you
seem
very
fond
of
animals
i
am
my
dear
i
have
four
horses
two
cows
a
tame
squirrel
three
dogs
and
a
cat
you
should
be
a
happy
woman
said
miss
laura
with
a
smile
i
think
i
am
i
must
not
forget
my
horned
toad
diego
that
i
got
in
california
i
keep
him
in
the
and
he
is
very
happy
catching
flies
and
holding
his
horny
head
to
be
scratched
whenever
any
one
comes
near
i
do
see
how
any
one
can
be
unkind
to
animals
said
miss
laura
thoughtfully
nor
i
my
dear
child
it
has
always
caused
me
intense
pain
to
witness
the
torture
of
dumb
animals
nearly
seventy
years
ago
when
i
was
a
little
girl
walking
the
streets
of
boston
i
would
tremble
and
grow
faint
at
the
cruelty
of
drivers
to
horses
i
was
timid
and
did
not
dare
speak
to
them
very
often
i
ran
home
and
flung
myself
in
my
mother
arms
with
a
burst
of
tears
and
asked
her
if
nothing
could
be
done
to
help
the
poor
animals
with
mistaken
motherly
kindness
she
tried
to
put
the
subject
out
of
my
thoughts
i
was
carefully
guarded
from
seeing
or
hearing
of
any
instances
of
cruelty
but
the
animals
went
on
suffering
just
the
same
and
when
i
became
a
woman
i
saw
my
cowardice
i
agitated
the
matter
among
my
friends
and
told
them
that
our
whole
dumb
creation
was
groaning
together
in
pain
and
would
continue
to
groan
unless
merciful
human
beings
were
willing
to
help
them
i
was
able
to
assist
in
the
formation
of
several
societies
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
animals
and
they
have
done
good
service
good
service
not
only
to
the
horses
and
cows
but
to
the
nobler
animal
man
i
believe
that
in
saying
to
a
cruel
man
shall
not
overwork
torture
mutilate
nor
kill
your
animal
or
neglect
to
provide
it
with
proper
food
and
shelter
we
are
making
him
a
little
nearer
the
kingdom
of
heaven
than
he
was
before
for
a
man
soweth
that
shall
he
also
reap
if
he
sows
seeds
of
unkindness
and
cruelty
to
man
and
beast
no
one
knows
what
the
blackness
of
the
harvest
will
be
his
poor
horse
quivering
under
a
blow
is
not
the
worst
sufferer
oh
if
people
would
only
understand
that
their
unkind
deeds
will
recoil
upon
their
own
heads
with
tenfold
force
but
my
dear
child
i
am
fancying
that
i
am
addressing
a
meeting
and
here
we
are
at
your
station
keep
your
happy
face
and
gentle
ways
i
hope
that
we
may
meet
again
some
day
she
pressed
miss
laura
hand
gave
me
a
farewell
pat
and
the
next
minute
we
were
outside
on
the
platform
and
she
was
smiling
through
the
window
at
us
chapter
xvi
dingley
farm
my
dear
niece
and
a
stout
woman
with
a
red
lively
face
threw
both
her
arms
around
miss
laura
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
and
this
is
the
dog
good
joe
i
have
a
bone
waiting
for
you
here
is
uncle
john
a
tall
man
stepped
up
and
put
out
a
big
hand
in
which
my
mistress
little
fingers
were
quite
swallowed
up
i
am
glad
to
see
you
laura
well
joe
how
d
do
old
boy
i
heard
about
you
it
made
me
feel
very
welcome
to
have
them
both
notice
me
and
i
was
so
glad
to
be
out
of
the
train
that
i
frisked
for
joy
around
their
feet
as
we
went
to
the
wagon
it
was
a
big
double
one
with
an
awning
over
it
to
shelter
it
from
the
sun
rays
and
the
horses
were
drawn
up
in
the
shade
of
a
spreading
tree
they
were
two
powerful
black
horses
and
as
they
had
no
blinders
on
they
could
see
us
coming
their
faces
lighted
up
and
they
moved
their
ears
and
pawed
the
ground
and
whinnied
when
wood
went
up
to
them
they
tried
to
rub
their
heads
against
him
and
i
saw
plainly
that
they
loved
him
steady
there
cleve
and
pacer
he
said
now
back
back
up
by
this
time
wood
miss
laura
and
i
were
in
the
wagon
then
wood
jumped
in
took
up
the
reins
and
off
we
went
how
the
two
black
horses
did
spin
along
i
sat
on
the
seat
beside
wood
and
sniffed
in
the
delicious
air
and
the
lovely
smell
of
flowers
and
grass
how
glad
i
was
to
be
in
the
country
what
long
races
i
should
have
in
the
green
fields
i
wished
that
i
had
another
dog
to
run
with
me
and
wondered
very
much
whether
wood
kept
one
i
knew
i
should
soon
find
out
for
whenever
miss
laura
went
to
a
place
she
wanted
to
know
what
animals
there
were
about
we
drove
a
little
more
than
a
mile
along
a
country
road
where
there
were
scattered
houses
miss
laura
answered
questions
about
her
family
and
asked
questions
about
harry
who
was
away
at
college
and
had
got
home
i
do
think
i
have
said
before
that
harry
was
son
she
was
a
widow
with
one
son
when
she
married
wood
so
that
harry
though
the
morrises
called
him
cousin
was
not
really
their
cousin
i
was
very
glad
to
hear
them
say
that
he
was
soon
coming
home
for
i
had
never
forgotten
that
but
for
him
i
should
never
have
known
miss
laura
and
gotten
into
my
pleasant
home
i
heard
miss
laura
say
uncle
john
have
you
a
dog
yes
laura
he
said
i
have
one
but
i
have
one
oh
uncle
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
well
laura
he
replied
you
know
animals
are
pretty
much
like
people
there
are
some
good
ones
and
some
bad
ones
now
this
dog
is
a
snarling
cantankerous
beast
and
when
i
heard
joe
was
coming
i
said
we
have
a
good
dog
about
the
place
and
an
end
to
the
bad
one
so
i
tied
bruno
up
and
i
shall
shoot
him
something
got
to
be
done
or
he
be
biting
some
one
uncle
said
miss
laura
people
do
always
die
when
they
are
bitten
by
dogs
do
they
no
certainly
not
replied
wood
in
my
humble
opinion
there
a
great
lot
of
nonsense
talked
about
the
poison
of
a
dog
bite
and
people
dying
of
hydrophobia
ever
since
i
was
born
i
had
dogs
snap
at
me
and
stick
their
teeth
in
my
flesh
and
i
never
had
a
symptom
of
hydrophobia
and
never
intend
to
have
i
believe
half
the
people
that
are
bitten
by
dogs
frighten
themselves
into
thinking
they
are
fatally
poisoned
i
was
reading
the
other
day
about
the
policemen
in
a
big
city
in
england
that
have
to
catch
stray
dogs
and
dogs
supposed
to
be
mad
and
all
kinds
of
dogs
and
they
get
bitten
over
and
over
again
and
never
think
anything
about
it
but
let
a
lady
or
a
gentleman
walking
along
the
street
have
a
dog
bite
them
and
they
worry
themselves
till
their
blood
is
in
a
fever
and
they
have
to
hurry
across
to
france
to
get
pasteur
to
cure
them
they
imagine
they
got
hydrophobia
and
they
got
it
because
they
imagine
it
i
believe
if
i
fixed
my
attention
on
that
right
thumb
of
mine
and
thought
i
had
a
sore
there
and
picked
at
it
and
worried
it
in
a
short
time
a
sore
would
come
and
i
be
off
to
the
doctor
to
have
it
cured
at
the
same
time
dogs
have
no
business
to
bite
and
i
do
recommend
any
one
to
get
bitten
but
uncle
said
miss
laura
is
there
such
a
thing
as
hydrophobia
oh
yes
i
dare
say
there
is
i
believe
that
a
careful
examination
of
the
records
of
death
reported
in
boston
from
hydrophobia
for
the
space
of
years
shows
that
two
people
actually
died
from
it
dogs
are
like
all
other
animals
they
liable
to
sickness
and
they
got
to
be
watched
i
think
my
horses
would
go
mad
if
i
starved
them
or
them
or
them
or
let
them
stand
in
laziness
or
kept
them
dirty
or
did
give
them
water
enough
they
get
some
disease
anyway
if
a
person
owns
an
animal
let
him
take
care
of
it
and
it
all
right
if
it
shows
signs
of
sickness
shut
it
up
and
watch
it
if
the
sickness
is
incurable
kill
it
here
a
sure
way
to
prevent
hydrophobia
kill
off
all
ownerless
and
vicious
dogs
if
you
ca
do
that
have
plenty
of
water
where
they
can
get
at
it
a
dog
that
has
all
the
water
he
wants
will
never
go
mad
this
dog
of
mine
has
not
one
single
thing
the
matter
with
him
but
pure
ugliness
yet
if
i
let
him
loose
and
he
ran
through
the
village
with
his
tongue
out
i
warrant
you
there
be
a
cry
of
dog
however
i
going
to
kill
him
no
use
for
a
bad
dog
have
plenty
of
animals
i
say
and
treat
them
kindly
but
if
there
a
vicious
one
among
them
put
it
out
of
the
way
for
it
is
a
constant
danger
to
man
and
beast
it
queer
how
ugly
some
people
are
about
their
dogs
they
keep
them
no
matter
how
they
worry
other
people
and
even
when
they
snatching
the
bread
out
of
their
neighbors
mouths
but
i
say
that
is
not
the
fault
of
the
dog
a
human
dog
is
the
worst
of
all
there
a
band
of
dogs
here
in
riverdale
that
their
owners
ca
or
wo
keep
out
of
mischief
fellows
some
of
them
are
the
owners
go
to
bed
at
night
and
the
dogs
pretend
to
go
too
but
when
the
house
is
quiet
and
the
family
asleep
off
goes
rover
or
fido
to
worry
poor
defenseless
creatures
that
ca
defend
themselves
their
taste
for
sheep
blood
is
like
the
taste
for
liquor
in
men
and
the
dogs
will
travel
as
far
to
get
their
fun
as
the
men
will
travel
for
theirs
they
got
it
in
them
and
you
ca
get
it
out
windham
cured
his
dog
said
wood
wood
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
so
he
did
so
he
did
i
must
tell
laura
about
that
windham
is
a
neighbor
of
ours
and
last
summer
i
kept
telling
him
that
his
collie
was
worrying
my
shropshires
he
believe
me
but
i
knew
i
was
right
and
one
night
when
harry
was
home
he
lay
in
wait
for
the
dog
and
lassoed
him
i
tied
him
up
and
sent
for
windham
you
should
have
seen
his
face
and
the
dog
face
he
said
two
words
scoundrel
and
the
dog
cowered
at
his
feet
as
if
he
had
been
shot
he
was
a
fine
dog
but
he
got
corrupted
by
evil
companions
then
windham
asked
me
where
my
sheep
were
i
told
him
in
the
pasture
he
asked
me
if
i
still
had
my
old
ram
bolton
i
said
yes
and
then
he
wanted
eight
or
ten
feet
of
rope
i
gave
it
to
him
and
wondered
what
on
earth
he
was
going
to
do
with
it
he
tied
one
end
of
it
to
the
collar
and
holding
the
other
in
his
hand
set
out
for
the
pasture
he
asked
us
to
go
with
him
and
when
he
got
there
he
told
harry
he
like
to
see
him
catch
bolton
there
was
any
need
to
catch
him
he
come
to
us
like
a
dog
harry
whistled
and
when
bolton
came
up
windham
fastened
the
rope
end
to
his
horns
and
let
him
go
the
ram
was
frightened
and
ran
dragging
the
dog
with
him
we
let
them
out
of
the
pasture
into
an
open
field
and
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
such
a
racing
and
chasing
over
that
field
as
i
never
saw
before
harry
leaned
up
against
the
bars
and
laughed
till
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
then
bolton
got
mad
and
began
to
make
battle
with
the
dog
pitching
into
him
with
his
horns
we
soon
stopped
that
for
the
spirit
had
all
gone
out
of
dash
windham
unfastened
the
rope
and
told
him
to
get
home
and
if
ever
i
saw
a
dog
run
that
one
did
windham
set
great
store
by
him
and
her
husband
did
want
to
kill
him
but
he
said
dash
had
got
to
give
up
his
if
he
wanted
to
live
that
cured
him
he
never
worried
a
sheep
from
that
day
to
this
and
if
you
offer
him
a
bit
of
sheep
wool
now
he
tucks
his
tail
between
his
legs
and
runs
for
home
now
i
must
stop
my
talk
for
we
in
sight
of
the
farm
yonder
our
boundary
line
and
there
the
house
you
see
a
difference
in
the
trees
since
you
were
here
before
we
had
come
to
a
turn
in
the
road
where
the
ground
sloped
gently
upward
we
turned
in
at
the
gate
and
drove
between
rows
of
trees
up
to
a
long
low
red
house
with
a
veranda
all
round
it
there
was
a
wide
lawn
in
front
and
away
on
our
right
were
the
farm
buildings
they
too
were
painted
red
and
there
were
some
trees
by
them
that
wood
called
his
windbreak
because
they
kept
the
snow
from
drifting
in
the
winter
time
i
thought
it
was
a
beautiful
place
miss
laura
had
been
here
before
but
not
for
some
years
so
she
too
was
looking
about
quite
eagerly
welcome
to
dingley
farm
joe
said
wood
with
her
jolly
laugh
as
she
watched
me
jump
from
the
carriage
seat
to
the
ground
come
in
and
i
introduce
you
to
pussy
aunt
hattie
why
is
the
farm
called
dingley
farm
said
miss
laura
as
we
went
into
the
house
it
ought
to
be
wood
farm
dingley
is
made
out
of
laura
you
know
that
pretty
hollow
back
of
the
pasture
it
is
what
they
call
a
so
this
farm
was
called
dingle
farm
till
the
people
around
about
got
saying
instead
i
suppose
they
found
it
easier
why
here
is
lolo
coming
to
see
joe
walking
along
the
wide
hall
that
ran
through
the
house
was
a
large
cat
she
had
a
prettily
marked
face
and
she
was
waving
her
large
tail
like
a
flag
and
mewing
kindly
to
greet
her
mistress
but
when
she
saw
me
what
a
face
she
made
she
flew
on
the
hall
table
and
putting
up
her
back
till
it
almost
lifted
her
feet
from
the
ground
began
to
spit
at
me
and
bristle
with
rage
poor
lolo
said
wood
going
up
to
her
joe
is
a
good
dog
and
not
like
bruno
he
wo
hurt
you
i
wagged
myself
about
a
little
and
looked
kindly
at
her
but
she
did
nothing
but
say
bad
words
to
me
it
was
weeks
and
weeks
before
i
made
friends
with
that
cat
she
was
a
young
thing
and
had
known
only
one
dog
and
he
was
a
bad
one
so
she
supposed
all
dogs
were
like
him
there
was
a
number
of
rooms
opening
off
the
hall
and
one
of
them
was
the
dining
room
where
they
had
tea
i
lay
on
a
rug
outside
the
door
and
watched
them
there
was
a
small
table
spread
with
a
white
cloth
and
it
had
pretty
dishes
and
glassware
on
it
and
a
good
many
different
kinds
of
things
to
eat
a
little
french
girl
called
adele
kept
coming
and
going
from
the
kitchen
to
give
them
hot
cakes
and
fried
eggs
and
hot
coffee
as
soon
as
they
finished
their
tea
wood
gave
me
one
of
the
best
meals
that
i
ever
had
in
my
life
chapter
xvii
wood
and
his
horses
the
morning
after
we
arrived
in
riverdale
i
was
up
very
early
and
walking
around
the
house
i
slept
in
the
woodshed
and
could
run
outdoors
whenever
i
liked
the
woodshed
was
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
near
it
was
the
tool
shed
then
there
was
a
carriage
house
and
a
plank
walk
leading
to
the
barnyard
i
ran
up
this
walk
and
looked
into
the
first
building
i
came
to
it
was
the
horse
stable
a
door
stood
open
and
the
morning
sun
was
glancing
in
there
were
several
horses
there
some
with
their
heads
toward
me
and
some
with
their
tails
i
saw
that
instead
of
being
tied
up
there
were
gates
outside
their
stalls
and
they
could
stand
in
any
way
they
liked
there
was
a
man
moving
about
at
the
other
end
of
the
stable
and
long
before
he
saw
me
i
knew
that
it
was
wood
what
a
nice
clean
stable
he
had
there
was
always
a
foul
smell
coming
out
of
jenkins
stable
but
here
the
air
seemed
as
pure
inside
as
outside
there
was
a
number
of
little
gratings
in
the
wall
to
let
in
the
fresh
air
and
they
were
so
placed
that
drafts
would
not
blow
on
the
horses
wood
was
going
from
one
horse
to
another
giving
them
hay
and
talking
to
them
in
a
cheerful
voice
at
last
he
spied
me
and
cried
out
the
top
of
the
morning
to
you
joe
you
are
up
early
do
come
too
near
the
horses
good
dog
as
i
walked
in
beside
him
they
might
think
you
are
another
bruno
and
give
you
a
sly
bite
or
kick
i
should
have
shot
him
long
ago
is
hard
to
make
a
good
dog
suffer
for
a
bad
one
but
that
the
way
of
the
world
well
old
fellow
what
do
you
think
of
my
horse
stable
pretty
fair
is
it
and
wood
went
on
talking
to
me
as
he
fed
and
groomed
his
horses
till
i
soon
found
out
that
his
chief
pride
was
in
them
i
like
to
have
human
beings
talk
to
me
morris
often
reads
his
sermons
to
me
and
miss
laura
tells
me
secrets
that
i
do
think
she
would
tell
to
any
one
else
i
watched
wood
carefully
while
he
groomed
a
huge
gray
that
he
called
dutchman
he
took
a
brush
in
his
right
hand
and
a
in
his
left
and
he
curried
and
brushed
every
part
of
the
horse
skin
and
afterward
wiped
him
with
a
cloth
a
good
grooming
is
equal
to
two
quarts
of
oats
joe
he
said
to
me
then
he
stooped
down
and
examined
the
horse
hoofs
your
shoes
are
too
heavy
dutchman
he
said
but
that
blacksmith
thinks
he
knows
more
about
horses
than
i
do
cut
the
sole
nor
the
frog
i
say
to
him
pare
the
hoof
so
much
and
do
rasp
it
and
fit
your
shoe
to
the
foot
and
not
the
foot
to
the
shoe
and
he
looks
as
if
he
wanted
to
say
your
own
business
we
not
go
to
him
again
tis
hard
to
teach
an
old
dog
new
tricks
i
got
you
to
work
for
me
not
to
wear
out
your
strength
in
lifting
about
his
weighty
shoes
wood
stopped
talking
for
a
few
minutes
and
whistled
a
tune
then
he
began
again
i
made
a
study
of
horses
joe
over
forty
years
studied
them
and
it
my
opinion
that
the
average
horse
knows
more
than
the
average
man
that
drives
him
when
i
think
of
the
stupid
fools
that
are
goading
patient
horses
about
beating
them
and
misunderstanding
them
and
thinking
they
are
only
clods
of
earth
with
a
little
life
in
them
i
like
to
take
their
horses
out
of
the
shafts
and
harness
them
in
and
i
trot
them
off
at
a
pace
and
slash
them
and
jerk
them
till
i
guess
they
come
out
with
a
little
less
patience
than
the
animal
does
look
at
this
dutchman
see
the
size
of
him
you
think
he
had
any
more
nerves
than
a
bit
of
granite
yet
he
got
a
skin
as
sensitive
as
a
girl
see
how
he
quivers
if
i
run
the
too
harshly
over
him
the
idiot
i
got
him
from
did
know
what
was
the
matter
with
him
bought
him
for
a
reliable
horse
and
there
he
was
kicking
and
stamping
whenever
the
boy
went
near
him
boy
got
too
heavy
a
hand
deacon
jones
said
i
when
he
described
the
horse
actions
to
me
may
depend
upon
it
a
creature
unlike
a
one
has
a
reason
for
everything
he
does
he
only
a
draught
horse
said
deacon
jones
horse
or
no
draught
horse
said
i
describing
a
horse
with
a
tender
skin
to
me
and
i
do
care
if
he
as
big
as
an
elephant
well
the
old
man
grumbled
and
said
he
did
want
any
thoroughbred
airs
in
his
stable
so
i
bought
you
did
i
dutchman
and
wood
stroked
him
kindly
and
went
to
the
next
stall
in
each
stall
was
a
small
tank
of
water
with
a
sliding
cover
and
i
found
out
afterward
that
these
covers
were
put
on
when
a
horse
came
in
too
heated
to
have
a
drink
at
any
other
time
he
could
drink
all
he
liked
wood
believed
in
having
plenty
of
pure
water
for
all
his
animals
and
they
all
had
their
own
place
to
get
a
drink
even
i
had
a
little
bowl
of
water
in
the
woodshed
though
i
could
easily
have
run
up
to
the
barnyard
when
i
wanted
a
drink
as
soon
as
i
came
wood
asked
adele
to
keep
it
there
for
me
and
when
i
looked
up
gratefully
at
her
she
said
every
animal
should
have
its
own
feeding
place
and
its
own
sleeping
place
joe
that
is
only
fair
the
next
horses
wood
groomed
were
the
black
ones
cleve
and
pacer
pacer
had
something
wrong
with
his
mouth
and
wood
turned
back
his
lips
and
examined
it
carefully
this
he
was
able
to
do
for
there
were
large
windows
in
the
stable
and
it
was
as
light
as
wood
house
was
no
dark
corners
here
eh
joe
said
wood
as
he
came
out
of
the
stall
and
passed
me
to
get
a
bottle
from
a
shelf
when
this
stable
was
built
i
said
no
dirt
holes
for
careless
men
here
i
want
the
sun
to
shine
in
the
corners
and
i
do
want
my
horses
to
smell
bad
smells
for
they
hate
them
and
i
do
want
them
starting
when
they
go
into
the
light
of
day
just
because
they
been
kept
in
a
black
hole
of
a
stable
and
i
never
had
a
sick
horse
yet
he
poured
something
from
a
bottle
into
a
saucer
and
went
back
to
pacer
with
it
i
followed
him
and
stood
outside
wood
seemed
to
be
washing
a
sore
in
the
horse
mouth
pacer
winced
a
little
and
wood
said
steady
steady
my
beauty
soon
be
over
the
horse
fixed
his
intelligent
eyes
on
his
master
and
looked
as
if
he
knew
that
he
was
trying
to
do
him
good
just
look
at
these
lips
joe
said
wood
delicate
and
fine
like
our
own
and
yet
there
are
brutes
that
will
jerk
them
as
if
they
were
made
of
iron
i
wish
the
lord
would
give
horses
voices
just
for
one
week
i
tell
you
they
scare
some
of
us
now
pacer
that
over
not
going
to
dose
you
much
for
i
do
believe
in
it
if
a
horse
has
got
a
serious
trouble
get
a
good
horse
doctor
say
i
if
it
a
simple
thing
try
a
simple
remedy
there
been
many
a
good
horse
drugged
and
dosed
to
death
well
scamp
my
beauty
how
are
you
this
morning
in
the
stall
next
to
pacer
was
a
small
mare
with
a
lean
head
slender
legs
and
a
curious
restless
manner
she
was
a
regular
greyhound
of
a
horse
no
spare
flesh
yet
wiry
and
able
to
do
a
great
deal
of
work
she
was
a
wicked
looking
little
thing
so
i
thought
i
had
better
keep
at
a
safe
distance
from
her
heels
wood
petted
her
a
great
deal
and
i
saw
that
she
was
his
favorite
saucebox
he
exclaimed
when
she
pretended
to
bite
him
you
know
if
you
bite
me
i
bite
back
again
i
think
i
conquered
you
he
said
proudly
as
he
stroked
her
glossy
neck
but
what
a
dance
you
led
me
do
you
remember
how
i
bought
you
for
a
mere
song
because
you
had
a
bad
habit
of
turning
around
like
a
flash
in
front
of
anything
that
frightened
you
and
bolting
off
the
other
way
and
how
did
i
cure
you
my
beauty
beat
you
and
make
you
stubborn
not
i
let
you
go
round
and
round
i
turned
you
and
twisted
you
the
oftener
the
better
for
me
till
at
last
i
got
it
into
your
pretty
head
that
turning
and
twisting
was
addling
your
brains
and
you
had
better
let
me
be
master
you
minded
me
from
that
day
have
you
horse
or
man
or
dog
are
much
good
till
they
learn
to
obey
and
i
thrown
you
down
and
i
do
it
again
if
you
bite
me
so
take
care
scamp
tossed
her
pretty
head
and
took
little
pieces
of
wood
shirt
sleeve
in
her
mouth
keeping
her
cunning
brown
eye
on
him
as
if
to
see
how
far
she
could
go
but
she
did
not
bite
him
i
think
she
loved
him
for
when
he
left
her
she
whinnied
shrilly
and
he
had
to
go
back
and
stroke
and
caress
her
after
that
i
often
used
to
watch
her
as
she
went
about
the
farm
she
always
seemed
to
be
tugging
and
striving
at
her
load
and
trying
to
step
out
fast
and
do
a
great
deal
of
work
wood
was
usually
driving
her
the
men
did
like
her
and
could
manage
her
she
had
not
been
properly
broken
in
after
wood
finished
his
work
he
went
and
stood
in
the
doorway
there
were
six
horses
altogether
dutchman
cleve
pacer
scamp
a
bay
mare
called
ruby
and
a
young
horse
belonging
to
harry
whose
name
was
fleetfoot
what
do
you
think
of
them
all
said
wood
looking
down
at
me
a
pretty
lot
of
horses
are
they
not
a
thoroughbred
there
but
worth
as
much
to
me
as
if
each
had
pedigree
as
long
as
this
plank
walk
there
a
lot
of
humbug
about
this
pedigree
business
in
horses
mine
have
their
manes
and
tails
anyway
and
the
proper
use
of
their
eyes
which
is
more
liberty
than
some
thoroughbreds
get
i
like
to
see
the
man
that
would
persuade
me
to
put
blinders
or
or
any
other
instrument
of
torture
on
my
horses
do
the
simpletons
know
that
blinders
are
the
cause
of
well
i
would
like
to
say
how
many
of
our
accidents
joe
for
fear
you
think
me
extravagant
and
the
drags
up
a
horse
head
out
of
its
fine
natural
curve
and
presses
sinews
bones
and
joints
together
till
the
horse
is
mad
ah
joe
this
is
a
cruel
world
for
man
or
beast
you
a
standing
token
of
that
with
your
missing
ears
and
tail
and
now
got
to
go
and
be
cruel
and
shoot
that
dog
he
must
be
disposed
of
before
anyone
else
is
astir
how
i
hate
to
take
life
he
sauntered
down
the
walk
to
the
tool
shed
went
in
and
soon
came
out
leading
a
large
brown
dog
by
a
chain
this
was
bruno
he
was
snapping
and
snarling
and
biting
at
his
chain
as
he
went
along
though
wood
led
him
very
kindly
and
when
he
saw
me
he
acted
as
if
he
could
have
torn
me
to
pieces
after
wood
took
him
behind
the
barn
he
came
back
and
got
his
gun
i
ran
away
so
that
i
would
not
hear
the
sound
of
it
for
i
could
not
help
feeling
sorry
for
bruno
miss
laura
room
was
on
one
side
of
the
house
and
in
the
second
story
there
was
a
little
balcony
outside
it
and
when
i
got
near
i
saw
that
she
was
standing
out
on
it
wrapped
in
a
shawl
her
hair
was
streaming
over
her
shoulders
and
she
was
looking
down
into
the
garden
where
there
were
a
great
many
white
and
yellow
flowers
in
bloom
i
barked
and
she
looked
at
me
dear
old
joe
i
will
get
dressed
and
come
down
she
hurried
into
her
room
and
i
lay
on
the
veranda
till
i
heard
her
step
then
i
jumped
up
she
unlocked
the
front
door
and
we
went
for
a
walk
down
the
lane
to
the
road
until
we
heard
the
breakfast
bell
as
soon
as
we
heard
it
we
ran
back
to
the
house
and
miss
laura
had
such
an
appetite
for
her
breakfast
that
her
aunt
said
the
country
had
done
her
good
already
chapter
xviii
wood
poultry
after
breakfast
wood
put
on
a
large
apron
and
going
into
the
kitchen
said
have
you
any
scraps
for
the
hens
adele
be
sure
and
not
give
me
anything
salty
the
french
girl
gave
her
a
dish
of
food
then
wood
asked
miss
laura
to
go
and
see
her
chickens
and
away
we
went
to
the
poultry
house
on
the
way
we
saw
wood
he
was
sitting
on
the
step
of
the
tool
shed
cleaning
his
gun
is
the
dog
dead
asked
miss
laura
yes
he
said
she
sighed
and
said
poor
creature
i
am
sorry
he
had
to
be
killed
uncle
what
is
the
most
merciful
way
to
kill
a
dog
sometimes
when
they
get
old
they
should
be
put
out
of
the
way
you
can
shoot
them
he
said
or
you
can
poison
them
i
shot
bruno
through
his
head
into
his
neck
there
a
right
place
to
aim
at
it
a
little
one
side
of
the
top
of
the
skull
if
you
remind
me
i
show
you
a
circular
i
have
in
the
house
it
tells
the
proper
way
to
kill
animals
the
american
humane
education
society
in
boston
puts
it
out
and
it
a
merciful
thing
you
do
know
anything
about
the
slaughtering
of
animals
laura
and
it
well
you
do
there
an
awful
amount
of
cruelty
practised
and
practised
by
some
people
that
think
themselves
pretty
good
i
have
my
lambs
killed
the
way
my
father
had
his
for
a
kingdom
i
never
forget
the
first
one
i
saw
butchered
i
would
feel
worse
at
a
hanging
now
and
that
white
ox
hattie
you
remember
my
telling
you
about
him
he
had
to
be
killed
and
father
sent
for
the
butcher
i
was
only
a
lad
and
i
was
all
of
a
shudder
to
have
the
life
of
the
creature
i
had
known
taken
from
him
the
butcher
stupid
clown
gave
him
eight
blows
before
he
struck
the
right
place
the
ox
bellowed
and
turned
his
great
black
eyes
on
my
father
and
i
fell
in
a
faint
miss
laura
turned
away
and
wood
followed
her
saying
if
ever
you
want
to
kill
a
cat
laura
give
it
cyanide
of
potassium
i
killed
a
poor
old
sick
cat
for
windham
the
other
day
we
put
half
a
teaspoonful
of
pure
cyanide
of
potassium
in
a
wooden
spoon
and
dropped
it
on
the
cat
tongue
as
near
the
throat
as
we
could
poor
pussy
she
died
in
a
few
seconds
do
you
know
i
was
reading
such
a
funny
thing
the
other
day
about
giving
cats
medicine
they
hate
it
and
one
can
scarcely
force
it
into
their
mouths
on
account
of
their
sharp
teeth
the
way
is
to
smear
it
on
their
sides
and
they
lick
it
off
a
good
idea
is
it
here
we
are
at
the
hen
house
or
rather
one
of
the
hen
houses
do
you
keep
your
hens
all
together
asked
miss
laura
only
in
the
winter
time
said
wood
i
divide
my
flock
in
the
spring
part
of
them
stay
here
and
part
go
to
the
orchard
to
live
in
little
movable
houses
that
we
put
about
in
different
places
i
feed
each
flock
morning
and
evening
at
their
own
little
house
they
know
get
no
food
even
if
they
come
to
my
house
so
they
stay
at
home
and
they
know
they
get
no
food
between
times
so
all
day
long
they
pick
and
scratch
in
the
orchard
and
destroy
so
many
bugs
and
insects
that
it
more
than
pays
for
the
trouble
of
keeping
them
there
does
this
flock
want
to
mix
up
with
the
other
asked
miss
laura
as
she
stepped
into
the
little
wooden
house
no
they
seem
to
understand
i
keep
my
eye
on
them
for
a
while
at
first
and
they
soon
find
out
that
they
not
to
fly
either
over
the
garden
fence
or
the
orchard
fence
they
roam
over
the
farm
and
pick
up
what
they
can
get
there
a
good
deal
of
sense
in
hens
if
one
manages
them
properly
i
love
them
because
they
are
such
good
mothers
we
were
in
the
little
wooden
house
by
this
time
and
i
looked
around
it
with
surprise
it
was
better
than
some
of
the
poor
people
houses
in
fairport
the
walls
were
white
and
clean
so
were
the
little
ladders
that
led
up
to
different
kinds
of
roosts
where
the
fowls
sat
at
night
some
roosts
were
thin
and
round
and
some
were
broad
and
flat
wood
said
that
the
broad
ones
were
for
a
heavy
fowl
called
the
brahma
every
part
of
the
little
house
was
almost
as
light
as
it
was
out
doors
on
account
of
the
large
windows
miss
laura
spoke
of
it
why
auntie
i
never
saw
such
a
light
hen
house
wood
was
diving
into
a
partly
place
where
it
was
not
so
light
and
where
the
nests
were
she
straightened
herself
up
her
face
redder
than
ever
and
looked
at
the
windows
with
a
pleased
smile
yes
there
not
a
hen
house
in
new
hampshire
with
such
big
windows
whenever
i
look
at
them
i
think
of
my
mother
hens
and
wish
that
they
could
have
had
a
place
like
this
they
would
have
thought
themselves
in
a
hen
paradise
when
i
was
a
girl
we
did
know
that
hens
loved
light
and
heat
and
all
winter
they
used
to
sit
in
a
dark
hencoop
and
the
cold
was
so
bad
that
their
combs
would
freeze
stiff
and
the
tops
of
them
would
drop
off
we
never
thought
about
it
if
we
had
any
sense
we
might
have
watched
them
on
a
fine
day
go
and
sit
on
the
compost
heap
and
sun
themselves
and
then
have
concluded
that
if
they
liked
light
and
heat
outside
they
like
it
inside
poor
biddies
they
were
so
cold
that
they
would
lay
us
any
eggs
in
winter
you
take
a
great
interest
in
your
poultry
do
you
auntie
said
miss
laura
yes
indeed
and
well
i
may
i
show
you
my
brown
leghorn
jenny
that
lay
eggs
enough
in
a
year
to
pay
for
the
newspapers
i
take
to
keep
myself
posted
in
poultry
matters
i
buy
all
my
own
clothes
with
my
hen
money
and
lately
i
started
a
bank
account
for
i
want
to
save
up
enough
to
start
a
few
stands
of
bees
even
if
i
did
want
to
be
kind
to
my
hens
it
would
pay
me
to
be
so
for
sake
of
the
profit
they
yield
of
course
they
quite
a
lot
of
trouble
sometimes
they
get
vermin
on
them
and
i
have
to
grease
them
and
dust
carbolic
acid
on
them
and
try
some
of
my
numerous
cures
then
i
must
keep
ashes
and
dust
wallows
for
them
and
be
very
particular
about
my
eggs
when
hens
are
sitting
and
see
that
the
hens
come
off
regularly
for
food
and
exercise
oh
there
are
a
hundred
things
i
have
to
think
of
but
i
always
say
to
any
one
that
thinks
of
raising
poultry
you
are
going
into
the
business
for
the
purpose
of
making
money
it
pays
to
take
care
of
them
there
one
thing
i
notice
said
miss
laura
and
that
is
that
your
drinking
fountains
must
be
a
great
deal
better
than
the
shallow
pans
that
i
have
seen
some
people
give
their
hens
water
in
dirty
things
they
are
said
wood
i
would
use
one
of
them
i
do
think
there
is
anything
worse
for
hens
than
drinking
dirty
water
my
hens
must
have
as
clean
water
as
i
drink
myself
and
in
winter
i
heat
it
for
them
if
it
poured
boiling
into
the
fountains
in
the
morning
it
keeps
warm
till
night
speaking
of
shallow
drinking
dishes
i
would
use
them
even
before
i
ever
heard
of
a
drinking
fountain
john
made
me
something
that
we
read
about
he
used
to
take
a
powder
keg
and
bore
a
little
hole
in
the
side
about
an
inch
from
the
top
then
fill
it
with
water
and
cover
with
a
pan
a
little
larger
round
than
the
keg
then
he
turned
the
keg
upside
down
without
taking
away
the
pan
the
water
ran
into
the
pan
only
as
far
as
the
hole
in
the
keg
and
it
would
have
to
be
used
before
more
would
flow
in
now
let
us
go
and
see
my
beautiful
bronze
turkeys
they
do
need
any
houses
for
they
roost
in
the
trees
the
year
round
we
found
the
flock
of
turkeys
and
miss
laura
admired
their
changeable
colors
very
much
some
of
them
were
very
large
and
i
did
not
like
them
for
the
gobblers
ran
at
me
and
made
a
dreadful
noise
in
their
throats
afterward
wood
showed
us
some
ducks
that
she
had
shut
up
in
a
yard
she
said
that
she
was
feeding
them
on
vegetable
food
to
give
their
flesh
a
pure
flavor
and
she
would
send
them
to
market
and
get
a
high
price
for
them
every
place
she
took
us
to
was
as
clean
as
possible
no
one
can
be
successful
in
raising
poultry
in
large
numbers
she
said
unless
they
keep
their
quarters
clean
and
comfortable
as
yet
we
had
seen
no
hens
except
a
few
on
the
nests
and
miss
laura
said
where
are
they
i
should
like
to
see
them
they
are
coming
said
wood
it
is
just
their
breakfast
time
and
they
are
as
punctual
as
clockwork
they
go
off
early
in
the
morning
to
scratch
about
a
little
for
themselves
first
as
she
spoke
she
stepped
off
the
plank
walk
and
looked
off
towards
the
fields
miss
laura
burst
out
laughing
away
beyond
the
barns
the
hens
were
coming
seeing
wood
standing
there
they
thought
they
were
late
and
began
to
run
and
fly
jumping
over
each
other
backs
and
stretching
out
their
necks
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
some
of
their
legs
seemed
sticking
straight
out
behind
it
was
very
funny
to
see
them
they
were
a
lot
of
poultry
mostly
white
with
glossy
feathers
and
bright
eyes
they
greedily
ate
the
food
scattered
to
them
and
wood
said
they
think
i
changed
their
breakfast
time
and
they
come
a
good
bit
earlier
and
yet
some
people
say
hens
have
no
sense
chapter
xix
a
band
of
mercy
a
few
evenings
after
we
came
to
dingley
farm
wood
and
miss
laura
were
sitting
out
on
the
veranda
and
i
was
lying
at
their
feet
auntie
said
miss
laura
what
do
those
letters
mean
on
that
silver
pin
that
you
wear
with
that
piece
of
ribbon
you
know
what
the
white
ribbon
means
do
you
asked
wood
yes
that
you
are
a
temperance
woman
does
it
it
does
and
the
star
pin
means
that
i
am
a
member
of
a
band
of
mercy
do
you
know
what
a
band
of
mercy
is
no
said
miss
laura
how
strange
i
should
think
that
you
would
have
several
in
fairport
a
cripple
boy
the
son
of
a
boston
artist
started
this
one
here
it
has
done
a
great
deal
of
good
there
is
a
meeting
and
i
will
take
you
to
it
if
you
like
it
was
on
monday
that
wood
had
this
talk
with
miss
laura
and
the
next
afternoon
after
all
the
work
was
done
they
got
ready
to
go
to
the
village
may
joe
go
asked
miss
laura
certainly
said
wood
he
is
such
a
good
dog
that
he
wo
be
any
trouble
i
was
very
glad
to
hear
this
and
trotted
along
by
them
down
the
lane
to
the
road
the
lane
was
a
very
cool
and
pleasant
place
there
were
tall
trees
growing
on
each
side
and
under
them
among
the
grass
pretty
wild
flowers
were
peeping
out
to
look
at
us
as
we
went
by
wood
and
miss
laura
talked
all
the
way
about
the
band
of
mercy
miss
laura
was
much
interested
and
said
that
she
would
like
to
start
one
in
fairport
it
is
a
very
simple
thing
said
wood
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
write
the
pledge
at
the
top
of
a
piece
of
paper
will
try
to
be
kind
to
all
harmless
living
creatures
and
try
to
protect
them
from
cruel
usage
and
get
thirty
people
to
sign
it
that
makes
a
band
i
have
formed
two
or
three
bands
by
keeping
slips
of
paper
ready
and
getting
people
that
come
to
visit
me
to
sign
them
i
call
them
bands
for
they
are
too
far
apart
to
meet
i
send
the
members
of
mercy
papers
and
i
get
such
nice
letters
from
them
telling
me
of
kind
things
they
do
for
animals
a
band
of
mercy
in
a
place
is
a
splendid
thing
there
the
greatest
difference
in
riverdale
since
this
one
was
started
a
few
years
ago
when
a
man
beat
or
raced
his
horse
and
any
one
interfered
he
said
horse
is
mine
i
do
what
i
like
with
him
most
people
thought
he
was
right
but
now
they
all
for
the
poor
horse
and
there
is
a
man
anywhere
around
who
would
dare
to
abuse
any
animal
it
all
the
children
they
doing
a
grand
work
and
i
say
it
a
good
thing
for
them
since
we
studied
this
subject
it
enough
to
frighten
one
to
read
what
is
sent
us
about
our
american
boys
and
girls
do
you
know
laura
that
with
all
our
brag
about
our
schools
and
colleges
that
really
are
wonderful
we
turning
out
more
criminals
than
any
other
civilized
country
in
the
world
except
spain
and
italy
the
cause
of
it
is
said
to
be
lack
of
proper
training
for
the
youth
of
our
land
immigration
has
something
to
do
with
it
too
we
thinking
too
much
about
educating
the
mind
and
forgetting
about
the
heart
and
soul
so
i
say
now
while
we
got
all
our
future
population
in
our
schools
saints
and
sinners
good
people
and
bad
people
let
us
try
to
slip
in
something
between
the
geography
and
history
and
grammar
that
will
go
a
little
deeper
and
touch
them
so
much
that
when
they
are
grown
up
and
go
out
in
the
world
they
will
carry
with
them
lessons
of
love
and
to
men
a
little
child
is
such
a
tender
thing
you
can
bend
it
anyway
you
like
speaking
of
this
heart
education
of
children
as
set
over
against
mind
education
i
see
that
many
say
that
there
is
nothing
better
than
to
give
them
lessons
on
kindness
to
animals
children
who
are
taught
to
love
and
protect
dumb
creatures
will
be
kind
to
their
when
they
grow
up
i
was
very
much
pleased
with
this
talk
between
wood
and
miss
laura
and
kept
close
to
them
so
that
i
would
not
miss
a
word
as
we
went
along
houses
began
to
appear
here
and
there
set
back
from
the
road
among
the
trees
soon
they
got
quite
close
together
and
i
saw
some
shops
this
was
the
village
of
riverdale
and
nearly
all
the
buildings
were
along
this
winding
street
the
river
was
away
back
of
the
village
we
had
already
driven
there
several
times
we
passed
the
school
on
our
way
it
was
a
square
white
building
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
large
yard
boys
and
girls
with
their
arms
full
of
books
were
hurrying
down
the
steps
and
coming
into
the
street
two
quite
big
boys
came
behind
us
and
wood
turned
around
and
spoke
to
them
and
asked
if
they
were
going
to
the
band
of
mercy
oh
yes
said
the
younger
one
i
got
a
recitation
do
you
remember
yes
yes
excuse
me
for
forgetting
said
wood
with
her
jolly
laugh
and
here
are
dolly
and
jennie
and
martha
she
went
on
as
some
little
girls
came
running
out
of
a
house
that
we
were
passing
the
little
girls
joined
us
and
looked
so
hard
at
my
head
and
stump
of
a
tail
and
my
fine
collar
that
i
felt
quite
shy
and
walked
with
my
head
against
miss
laura
dress
she
stooped
down
and
patted
me
and
then
i
felt
as
if
i
did
care
how
much
they
stared
miss
laura
never
forgot
me
no
matter
how
earnestly
she
was
talking
or
playing
a
game
or
doing
anything
she
always
stopped
occasionally
to
give
me
a
word
or
look
to
show
that
she
knew
i
was
near
wood
paused
in
front
of
a
building
on
the
main
street
a
great
many
boys
and
girls
were
going
in
and
we
went
with
them
we
found
ourselves
in
a
large
room
with
a
platform
at
one
end
of
it
there
were
some
chairs
on
this
platform
and
a
small
table
a
boy
stood
by
this
table
with
his
hand
on
a
bell
presently
he
rang
it
and
then
every
one
kept
still
wood
whispered
to
miss
laura
that
this
boy
was
the
president
of
the
band
and
the
young
man
with
the
pale
face
and
curly
hair
who
sat
in
front
of
him
was
maxwell
the
artist
son
who
had
formed
this
band
of
mercy
the
lad
who
presided
had
a
ringing
pleasant
voice
he
said
they
would
begin
their
meeting
by
singing
a
hymn
there
was
an
organ
near
the
platform
and
a
young
girl
played
on
it
while
all
the
other
boys
and
girls
stood
up
and
sang
very
sweetly
and
clearly
after
they
had
sung
the
hymn
the
president
asked
for
the
report
of
their
last
meeting
a
little
girl
blushing
and
hanging
her
head
came
forward
and
read
what
was
written
on
a
paper
that
she
held
in
her
hand
the
president
made
some
remarks
after
she
had
finished
and
then
every
one
had
to
vote
it
was
just
like
a
meeting
of
grown
people
and
i
was
surprised
to
see
how
good
those
children
were
they
did
not
frolic
nor
laugh
but
all
seemed
sober
and
listened
attentively
after
the
voting
was
over
the
president
called
upon
john
turner
to
give
a
recitation
this
was
the
boy
whom
we
saw
on
the
way
there
he
walked
up
to
the
platform
made
a
bow
and
said
that
he
had
learned
two
stories
for
his
recitation
out
of
the
paper
dumb
animals
one
story
was
about
a
horse
and
the
other
was
about
a
dog
and
he
thought
that
they
were
two
of
the
best
animal
stories
on
record
he
would
tell
the
horse
story
first
a
man
in
missouri
had
to
go
to
nebraska
to
see
about
some
land
he
went
on
horseback
on
a
horse
that
he
had
trained
himself
and
that
came
at
his
whistle
like
a
dog
on
getting
into
nebraska
he
came
to
a
place
where
there
were
two
roads
one
went
by
a
river
and
the
other
went
over
the
hill
the
man
saw
that
the
travel
went
over
the
hill
but
thought
he
take
the
river
road
he
did
know
that
there
was
a
quicksand
across
it
and
that
people
could
use
it
in
spring
and
summer
there
used
to
be
a
sign
board
to
tell
strangers
about
it
but
it
had
been
taken
away
the
man
got
off
his
horse
to
let
him
graze
and
walked
along
till
he
got
so
far
ahead
of
the
horse
that
he
had
to
sit
down
and
wait
for
him
suddenly
he
found
that
he
was
on
a
quicksand
his
feet
had
sunk
in
the
sand
and
he
could
not
get
them
out
he
threw
himself
down
and
whistled
for
his
horse
and
shouted
for
help
but
no
one
came
he
could
hear
some
young
people
singing
out
on
the
river
but
they
could
not
hear
him
the
terrible
sand
drew
him
in
almost
to
his
shoulders
and
he
thought
he
was
lost
at
that
moment
the
horse
came
running
up
and
stood
by
his
master
the
man
was
too
low
down
to
get
hold
of
the
saddle
or
bridle
so
he
took
hold
of
the
horse
tail
and
told
him
to
go
the
horse
gave
an
awful
pull
and
landed
his
master
on
safe
ground
everybody
clapped
his
hands
and
stamped
when
this
story
was
finished
and
called
out
the
dog
story
the
dog
story
the
boy
bowed
and
smiled
and
began
again
you
all
know
what
a
of
cattle
is
so
i
need
not
explain
once
a
man
down
south
was
going
to
have
one
and
he
and
his
boys
and
friends
were
talking
it
over
there
was
an
ugly
black
steer
in
the
herd
and
they
were
wondering
whether
their
old
yellow
dog
would
be
able
to
manage
him
the
dog
name
was
tige
and
he
lay
and
listened
wisely
to
their
talk
the
next
day
there
was
a
scene
of
great
confusion
the
steer
raged
and
tore
about
and
would
allow
no
one
to
come
within
whip
touch
of
him
tige
who
had
always
been
brave
skulked
about
for
a
while
and
then
as
if
he
had
got
up
a
little
spirit
he
made
a
run
at
the
steer
the
steer
sighted
him
gave
a
bellow
and
lowering
his
horns
ran
at
him
tige
turned
tail
and
the
young
men
that
owned
him
were
frantic
they
been
praising
him
and
thought
they
were
going
to
have
it
proven
false
their
father
called
out
shoot
tige
till
you
see
where
he
running
to
the
dog
ran
right
to
the
cattle
pen
the
steer
was
so
enraged
that
he
never
noticed
where
he
was
going
and
dashed
in
after
him
tige
leaped
the
wall
and
came
back
to
the
gate
barking
and
yelping
for
the
men
to
come
and
shut
the
steer
in
they
shut
the
gate
and
petted
tige
and
bought
him
a
collar
with
a
silver
plate
the
boy
was
loudly
cheered
and
went
to
his
seat
the
president
said
he
would
like
to
have
remarks
made
about
these
two
stories
several
children
put
up
their
hands
and
he
asked
each
one
to
speak
in
turn
one
said
that
if
that
man
horse
had
had
a
docked
tail
his
master
would
have
been
able
to
reach
it
and
would
have
perished
another
said
that
if
the
man
had
treated
his
horse
kindly
he
never
would
have
come
at
his
whistle
and
stood
over
him
to
see
what
he
could
do
to
help
him
a
third
child
said
that
the
people
on
the
river
as
quick
at
hearing
the
voice
of
the
man
in
trouble
as
the
horse
was
when
this
talk
was
over
the
president
called
for
some
stories
of
foreign
animals
another
boy
came
forward
made
his
bow
and
said
in
a
short
abrupt
voice
my
uncle
name
is
henry
worthington
he
is
an
englishman
and
once
he
was
a
soldier
in
india
one
day
when
he
was
hunting
in
the
punjab
he
saw
a
mother
monkey
carrying
a
little
dead
baby
monkey
six
months
after
he
was
in
the
same
jungle
saw
same
monkey
still
carrying
dead
baby
monkey
all
shriveled
up
mother
monkey
loved
her
baby
monkey
and
would
give
it
up
the
boy
went
to
his
seat
and
the
president
with
a
queer
look
in
his
face
said
that
a
very
good
story
ronald
if
it
is
true
none
of
the
children
laughed
but
wood
face
got
like
a
red
poppy
and
miss
laura
bit
her
lip
and
maxwell
buried
his
head
in
his
arms
his
whole
frame
shaking
the
boy
who
told
the
story
looked
very
angry
he
jumped
up
again
my
uncle
a
true
man
phil
dodge
and
never
told
a
lie
in
his
life
the
president
remained
standing
his
face
a
deep
scarlet
and
a
tall
boy
at
the
back
of
the
room
got
up
and
said
president
what
would
be
impossible
in
this
climate
might
be
possible
in
a
hot
country
like
india
does
heat
sometimes
draw
up
and
preserve
things
the
president
face
cleared
thank
you
for
the
suggestion
he
said
i
do
want
to
hurt
anybody
feelings
but
you
know
there
is
a
rule
in
the
band

be
told

a
merry
face

up
just
behind
miss
laura
and
made
her
way
to
the
front
my
dranfadder

began
in
a
piping
little
voice
dat
when

a
little
boy
his
fadder

him
a
little
monkey
from
de

and
shook

wid
de
man
my
dranfadder
saw
him
she
said
with
a
shake
of
her
head
at
the
president
as
if
she
was
afraid
he
would
doubt
her
there
was
great
laughing
and
clapping
of
hands
when
this
little
girl
took
her
seat
and
she
hopped
right
up
again
and
ran
back
oh
i
fordot
she
went
on
in
her
squeaky
little
voice
dat
my
dranfadder
says
dat
afterward
de
monkey
upset
de
painter
can
of
oil
and
rolled
in
it
and
den
jumped
down
in
my
dranfadder
flour
barrel
the
president
looked
very
much
amused
and
said
we
have
had
some
good
stories
about
monkeys
now
let
us
have
some
more
about
our
home
animals
who
can
tell
us
another
story
about
a
horse
three
or
four
boys
jumped
up
but
the
president
said
they
would
take
one
at
a
time
the
first
one
was
this
a
riverdale
boy
was
walking
along
the
bank
of
a
canal
in
hoytville
he
saw
a
boy
driving
two
horses
which
were
towing
a
the
first
horse
was
lazy
and
the
boy
got
angry
and
struck
him
several
times
over
the
head
with
his
whip
the
riverdale
boy
shouted
across
to
him
begging
him
not
to
be
so
cruel
but
the
boy
paid
no
attention
suddenly
the
horse
turned
seized
his
tormentor
by
the
shoulder
and
pushed
him
into
the
canal
the
water
was
not
deep
and
the
boy
after
floundering
about
for
a
few
seconds
came
out
dripping
with
mud
and
filth
and
sat
down
on
the
tow
path
and
looked
at
the
horse
with
such
a
comical
expression
that
the
riverdale
boy
had
to
stuff
his
handkerchief
in
his
mouth
to
keep
from
laughing
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
he
would
learn
a
lesson
said
the
president
and
be
kinder
to
his
horse
in
the
future
now
bernard
howe
your
story
the
boy
was
a
brother
to
the
little
girl
who
had
told
the
monkey
story
and
he
too
had
evidently
been
talking
to
his
grandfather
he
told
two
stories
and
miss
laura
listened
eagerly
for
they
were
about
fairport
the
boy
said
that
when
his
grandfather
was
young
he
lived
in
fairport
maine
on
a
certain
day
he
stood
in
the
market
square
to
see
their
first
put
together
it
had
come
from
boston
in
pieces
for
there
was
no
one
in
fairport
that
could
make
one
the
coach
went
away
up
into
the
country
one
day
and
came
back
the
next
for
a
long
time
no
one
understood
driving
the
horses
properly
and
they
came
in
day
after
day
with
the
blood
streaming
from
them
the
would
swing
round
and
hit
them
and
when
their
collars
were
taken
off
their
necks
would
be
raw
and
bloody
after
a
time
the
men
got
to
understand
how
to
drive
a
coach
and
the
horses
did
not
suffer
so
much
the
other
story
was
about
a
not
a
steamboat
more
than
seventy
years
ago
they
had
no
steamers
running
between
fairport
and
the
island
opposite
where
people
went
for
the
summer
but
they
had
what
they
called
a
that
is
a
boat
with
machinery
to
make
it
go
that
could
be
worked
by
horses
there
were
eight
horses
that
went
around
and
around
and
made
the
boat
go
one
afternoon
two
dancing
masters
who
were
wicked
fellows
that
played
the
fiddle
and
never
went
to
church
on
sundays
got
on
the
boat
and
sat
just
where
the
horses
had
to
pass
them
as
they
went
around
every
time
the
horses
went
by
they
jabbed
them
with
their
penknives
the
man
who
was
driving
the
horses
at
last
saw
the
blood
dripping
from
them
and
the
dancing
masters
were
found
out
some
young
men
on
the
boat
were
so
angry
that
they
caught
up
a
rope
end
and
gave
the
dancing
masters
a
lashing
and
then
threw
them
into
the
water
and
made
them
swim
to
the
island
when
this
boy
took
a
seat
a
young
girl
read
some
verses
that
she
had
clipped
from
a
newspaper
do
kill
the
toads
the
ugly
toads
that
hop
around
your
door
each
meal
the
little
toad
doth
eat
a
hundred
bugs
or
more
he
sits
around
with
aspect
meek
until
the
bug
hath
neared
then
shoots
he
forth
his
little
tongue
like
lightning
and
then
he
soberly
doth
wink
and
shut
his
ugly
mug
and
patiently
doth
wait
until
there
comes
another
bug
maxwell
told
a
good
dog
story
after
this
he
said
the
president
need
not
have
any
fears
as
to
its
truth
for
it
had
happened
in
his
boarding
house
in
the
village
and
he
had
seen
it
himself
monday
the
day
before
being
his
landlady
had
put
out
a
large
washing
among
the
clothes
on
the
line
was
a
gray
flannel
shirt
belonging
to
her
husband
the
young
dog
belonging
to
the
house
had
pulled
the
shirt
from
the
line
and
torn
it
to
pieces
the
woman
put
it
aside
and
told
him
master
would
beat
him
when
the
man
came
home
to
his
dinner
he
showed
the
dog
the
pieces
of
the
shirt
and
gave
him
a
severe
whipping
the
dog
ran
away
visited
all
the
clothes
lines
in
the
village
till
he
found
a
gray
shirt
very
like
his
master
he
seized
it
and
ran
home
laying
it
at
his
master
feet
joyfully
wagging
his
tail
meanwhile
maxwell
story
done
a
boy
called
simon
grey
got
up
and
said
you
all
know
our
old
gray
horse
ned
last
week
father
sold
him
to
a
man
in
hoytville
and
i
went
to
the
station
when
he
was
shipped
he
was
put
in
a
box
car
the
doors
were
left
a
little
open
to
give
him
air
and
were
locked
in
that
way
there
was
a
narrow
sliding
door
four
feet
from
the
floor
of
the
car
and
in
some
way
or
other
old
ned
pushed
this
door
open
crawled
through
it
and
tumbled
out
on
the
ground
when
i
was
coming
from
school
i
saw
him
walking
along
the
track
he
had
hurt
himself
except
for
a
few
cuts
he
was
glad
to
see
me
and
followed
me
home
he
must
have
gotten
off
the
train
when
it
was
going
full
speed
for
he
had
been
seen
at
any
of
the
stations
and
the
trainmen
were
astonished
to
find
the
doors
locked
and
the
car
empty
when
they
got
to
hoytville
father
got
the
man
who
bought
him
to
release
him
from
his
bargain
for
he
says
if
ned
is
so
fond
of
riverdale
he
shall
stay
here
the
president
asked
the
boys
and
girls
to
give
three
cheers
for
old
ned
and
then
they
had
some
more
singing
after
all
had
taken
their
seats
he
said
he
would
like
to
know
what
the
members
had
been
doing
for
animals
during
the
past
fortnight
one
girl
had
kept
her
brother
from
shooting
two
owls
that
came
about
their
barnyard
she
told
him
that
the
owls
would
destroy
the
rats
and
mice
that
bothered
him
in
the
barn
but
if
he
hunted
them
they
would
go
to
the
woods
a
boy
said
that
he
had
persuaded
some
of
his
friends
who
were
going
fishing
to
put
their
bait
worms
into
a
dish
of
boiling
water
to
kill
them
before
they
started
and
also
to
promise
him
that
as
soon
as
they
took
their
fish
out
of
the
water
they
would
kill
them
by
a
sharp
blow
on
the
back
of
the
head
they
were
all
the
more
ready
to
do
this
when
he
told
them
that
their
fish
would
taste
better
when
cooked
if
they
had
been
killed
as
soon
as
they
were
taken
from
the
water
into
the
air
a
little
girl
had
gotten
her
mother
to
say
that
she
would
never
again
put
lobsters
into
cold
water
and
slowly
boil
them
to
death
she
had
also
stopped
a
man
in
the
street
who
was
carrying
a
pair
of
fowls
with
their
heads
down
and
asked
him
if
he
would
kindly
reverse
their
position
the
man
told
her
that
the
fowls
did
mind
and
she
pursed
up
her
small
mouth
and
showed
the
band
how
she
said
to
him
i
would
prefer
the
opinion
of
the
hens
then
she
said
he
had
laughed
at
her
and
said
certainly
little
lady
and
had
gone
off
carrying
them
as
she
wanted
him
to
she
had
also
reasoned
with
different
boys
outside
the
village
who
were
throwing
stones
at
birds
and
frogs
and
sticking
butterflies
and
had
invited
them
to
come
to
the
band
of
mercy
this
child
seemed
to
have
done
more
than
any
one
else
for
dumb
animals
she
had
taken
around
a
petition
to
the
village
boys
asking
them
not
to
search
for
birds
eggs
and
she
had
even
gone
into
her
father
stable
and
asked
him
to
hold
her
up
so
that
she
could
look
into
the
mouths
to
see
if
their
teeth
wanted
filing
or
were
decayed
when
her
father
laughed
at
her
she
told
him
that
horses
often
suffer
terrible
pain
from
their
teeth
and
that
sometimes
a
runaway
is
caused
by
a
metal
bit
striking
against
the
exposed
nerve
in
the
tooth
of
a
horse
that
has
become
almost
frantic
with
pain
she
was
a
very
gentle
girl
and
i
think
by
the
way
that
she
spoke
that
her
father
loved
her
dearly
for
she
told
how
much
trouble
he
had
taken
to
make
some
tiny
houses
for
her
that
she
wanted
for
the
wrens
that
came
about
their
farm
she
told
him
that
those
little
birds
are
so
good
at
catching
insects
that
they
ought
to
give
all
their
time
to
it
and
not
have
any
worry
about
making
houses
her
father
made
their
homes
very
small
so
that
the
english
sparrows
could
not
get
in
and
crowd
them
out
a
boy
said
that
he
had
gotten
a
pot
of
paint
and
painted
in
large
letters
on
the
fences
around
his
father
farm
spare
the
toads
kill
the
birds
every
bird
killed
is
a
loss
to
the
country
that
reminds
me
said
the
president
to
ask
the
girls
what
they
have
done
about
the
millinery
business
i
have
told
my
mother
said
a
tall
girl
that
i
think
it
is
wrong
to
wear
bird
feathers
and
she
has
promised
to
give
up
wearing
any
of
them
except
ostrich
plumes
wood
asked
permission
to
say
a
few
words
just
here
and
the
president
said
certainly
we
are
always
glad
to
hear
from
you
she
went
up
on
the
platform
and
faced
the
roomful
of
children
dear
boys
and
girls
she
began
i
have
had
some
papers
sent
me
from
boston
giving
some
facts
about
the
killing
of
our
birds
and
i
want
to
state
a
few
of
them
to
you
you
all
know
that
nearly
every
tree
and
plant
that
grows
swarms
with
insect
life
and
that
they
could
grow
if
the
birds
did
eat
the
insects
that
would
devour
their
foliage
all
day
long
the
little
beaks
of
the
birds
are
busy
the
dear
little
carefully
examines
the
potato
plants
and
picks
off
the
beetles
the
martins
destroy
weevil
the
quail
and
grouse
family
eats
the
the
woodpeckers
dig
the
worms
from
the
trees
and
many
other
birds
eat
the
flies
and
gnats
and
mosquitoes
that
torment
us
so
no
flying
or
crawling
creature
escapes
their
sharp
little
eyes
a
great
frenchman
says
that
if
it
were
for
the
birds
human
beings
would
perish
from
the
face
of
the
earth
they
are
doing
all
this
for
us
and
how
are
we
rewarding
them
all
over
america
they
are
hunted
and
killed
five
million
birds
must
be
caught
every
year
for
american
women
to
wear
in
their
hats
and
bonnets
just
think
of
it
girls
is
it
dreadful
five
million
innocent
hardworking
beautiful
birds
killed
that
thoughtless
girls
and
women
may
ornament
themselves
with
their
little
dead
bodies
one
million
bobolinks
have
been
killed
in
one
month
near
philadelphia
seventy
were
sent
from
one
long
island
village
to
new
york
milliners
in
florida
cruel
men
shoot
the
mother
birds
on
their
nests
while
they
are
rearing
their
young
because
their
plumage
is
prettiest
at
that
time
the
little
ones
cry
pitifully
and
starve
to
death
every
bird
of
the
rarer
kinds
that
is
killed
such
as
humming
birds
orioles
and
kingfishers
means
the
death
of
several
others
that
is
the
young
that
starve
to
death
the
wounded
that
fly
away
to
die
and
those
whose
plumage
is
so
torn
that
it
is
not
fit
to
put
in
a
fine
lady
bonnet
in
some
cases
where
birds
have
gay
wings
and
the
hunters
do
not
wish
the
rest
of
the
body
they
tear
off
the
wings
from
the
living
bird
and
throw
it
away
to
die
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
such
painful
things
but
i
think
you
ought
to
know
them
you
will
soon
be
men
and
women
do
what
you
can
to
stop
this
horrid
trade
our
beautiful
birds
are
being
taken
from
us
and
the
insect
pests
are
increasing
the
state
of
massachusetts
has
lost
over
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
because
it
did
not
protect
its
birds
the
gypsy
moth
stripped
the
trees
near
boston
and
the
state
had
to
pay
out
all
this
money
and
even
then
could
not
get
rid
of
the
moths
the
birds
could
have
done
it
better
than
the
state
but
they
were
all
gone
my
last
words
to
you
are
the
birds
wood
went
to
her
seat
and
though
the
boys
and
girls
had
listened
very
attentively
none
of
them
cheered
her
their
faces
looked
sad
and
they
kept
very
quiet
for
a
few
minutes
i
saw
one
or
two
little
girls
wiping
their
eyes
i
think
they
felt
sorry
for
the
birds
has
any
boy
done
anything
about
blinders
and
asked
the
president
after
a
time
a
boy
stood
up
i
had
a
picnic
last
monday
he
said
father
let
me
cut
all
the
blinders
off
our
with
my
penknife
how
did
you
get
him
to
consent
to
that
asked
the
president
i
told
him
said
the
boy
that
i
could
get
to
sleep
for
thinking
of
him
you
know
he
drives
a
good
deal
late
at
night
i
told
him
that
every
dark
night
he
came
from
sudbury
i
thought
of
the
deep
ditch
alongside
the
road
and
wished
his
horses
had
blinders
on
and
every
night
he
comes
from
the
junction
and
has
to
drive
along
the
river
bank
where
the
water
has
washed
away
the
earth
till
the
wheels
of
the
wagon
are
within
a
foot
or
two
of
the
edge
i
wished
again
that
his
horses
could
see
each
side
of
them
for
i
knew
they
have
sense
enough
to
keep
out
of
danger
if
they
could
see
it
father
said
that
might
be
very
true
and
yet
his
horses
had
been
broken
in
with
blinders
and
did
i
think
they
would
be
inclined
to
shy
if
he
took
them
off
and
would
they
be
frightened
to
look
around
and
see
the
wagon
wheels
so
near
i
told
him
that
for
every
accident
that
happened
to
a
horse
without
blinders
several
happened
to
a
horse
with
them
and
then
i
gave
him
opinion
wood
out
at
dingley
farm
he
says
that
the
worst
thing
against
blinders
is
that
a
frightened
horse
never
knows
when
he
has
passed
the
thing
that
scared
him
he
always
thinks
it
is
behind
him
the
blinders
are
there
and
he
ca
see
that
he
has
passed
it
and
he
turn
his
head
to
have
a
good
look
at
it
so
often
he
goes
tearing
madly
on
and
sometimes
lives
are
lost
all
on
account
of
a
little
bit
of
leather
fastened
over
a
beautiful
eye
that
ought
to
look
out
full
and
free
at
the
world
that
finished
father
he
said
he
take
off
his
blinders
and
if
he
had
an
accident
he
send
the
bill
for
damages
to
wood
but
we
had
no
accident
the
horses
did
act
rather
queerly
at
first
and
started
a
little
but
they
soon
got
over
it
and
now
they
go
as
steady
without
blinders
as
they
ever
did
with
them
the
boy
sat
down
and
the
president
said
i
think
it
is
time
that
the
whole
nation
threw
off
this
foolishness
of
half
covering
their
eyes
just
put
your
hands
up
to
your
eyes
members
of
the
band
half
cover
them
and
see
how
shut
in
you
will
feel
and
how
curious
you
will
be
to
know
what
is
going
on
beside
you
suppose
a
girl
saw
a
mouse
with
her
eyes
half
covered
would
she
run
everybody
laughed
and
the
president
asked
some
one
to
tell
him
who
invented
blinders
an
english
nobleman
shouted
a
boy
who
had
a
horse
he
wanted
to
cover
up
the
defect
and
i
think
it
is
a
great
shame
that
all
the
american
horses
have
to
suffer
because
that
english
one
had
an
ugly
eye
so
do
i
said
the
president
three
groans
for
blinders
boys
all
the
children
in
the
room
made
three
dreadful
noises
away
down
in
their
throats
then
they
had
another
good
laugh
and
the
president
became
sober
again
seven
more
minutes
he
said
this
meeting
has
got
to
be
let
out
at
five
sharp
a
tall
girl
at
the
back
of
the
room
rose
and
said
my
little
cousin
has
two
stories
that
she
would
like
to
tell
the
band
very
well
said
the
president
bring
her
right
along
the
big
girl
came
forward
leading
a
tiny
child
that
she
placed
in
front
of
the
boys
and
girls
the
child
stared
up
into
her
cousin
face
turning
and
twisting
her
white
pinafore
through
her
fingers
every
time
the
big
girl
took
her
pinafore
away
from
her
she
picked
it
up
again
begin
nannie
said
the
big
girl
kindly
well
cousin
eleanor
said
the
child
you
know
topsy
graham
pony
well
topsy
run
away
and
a
big
big
man
came
out
to
papa
and
said
he
would
train
topsy
so
he
drove
her
every
day
and
beat
her
and
beat
her
till
he
was
tired
but
still
topsy
would
run
away
then
papa
said
he
would
not
have
the
poor
pony
whipped
so
much
and
he
took
her
out
a
piece
of
bread
every
day
and
he
petted
her
and
now
topsy
is
very
gentle
and
never
runs
away
tell
about
tiger
said
the
girl
well
cousin
eleanor
said
the
child
you
know
tiger
our
big
dog
he
used
to
be
a
bad
dog
and
when
fairchild
drove
up
to
the
house
he
jumped
up
and
bit
at
him
fairchild
used
to
speak
kindly
to
him
and
throw
out
bits
of
meat
and
now
when
he
comes
tiger
follows
behind
and
wags
his
tail
now
give
me
a
kiss
the
girl
had
to
give
her
a
kiss
right
up
there
before
every
one
and
what
a
stamping
the
boys
made
the
larger
girl
blushed
and
hurried
back
to
her
seat
with
the
child
clinging
to
her
hand
there
was
one
more
story
about
a
brave
newfoundland
dog
that
saved
eight
lives
by
swimming
out
to
a
wrecked
sailing
vessel
and
getting
a
rope
by
which
the
men
came
ashore
and
then
a
lad
got
up
whom
they
all
greeted
with
cheers
and
cries
of
the
poet
the
poet
i
did
know
what
they
meant
till
wood
whispered
to
miss
laura
that
he
was
a
boy
who
made
rhymes
and
the
children
had
rather
hear
him
speak
than
any
one
else
in
the
room
he
had
a
snub
nose
and
freckles
and
i
think
he
was
the
plainest
boy
there
but
that
did
matter
if
the
other
children
loved
him
he
sauntered
up
to
the
front
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
a
very
grand
manner
the
beautiful
poetry
recited
here
he
drawled
put
some
verses
in
my
mind
that
i
never
had
till
i
came
here
everyone
present
cheered
wildly
and
he
began
in
a
singsong
voice
i
am
a
band
of
mercy
boy
i
would
not
hurt
a
fly
i
always
speak
to
dogs
and
cats
i
pass
them
by
i
always
let
the
birdies
sing
i
never
throw
a
stone
i
always
give
a
hungry
dog
a
nice
fat
meaty
bone
i
would
drive
a
horse
nor
hurry
up
a
cow
i
then
he
forgot
the
rest
the
boys
and
girls
were
so
sorry
they
called
out
pig
goat
calf
sheep
hens
ducks
and
all
the
other
animals
names
they
could
think
of
but
none
of
them
was
right
and
as
the
boy
had
just
made
up
the
poetry
no
one
knew
what
the
next
could
be
he
stood
for
a
long
time
staring
at
the
ceiling
then
he
said
i
guess
i
have
to
give
it
up
the
children
looked
dreadfully
disappointed
perhaps
you
will
remember
it
by
our
next
meeting
said
the
president
anxiously
possibly
said
the
boy
but
probably
not
i
think
it
is
gone
forever
and
he
went
to
his
seat
the
next
thing
was
to
call
for
new
members
miss
laura
got
up
and
said
she
would
like
to
join
their
band
of
mercy
i
followed
her
up
to
the
platform
while
they
pinned
a
little
badge
on
her
and
every
one
laughed
at
me
then
they
sang
god
bless
our
native
land
and
the
president
told
us
that
we
might
all
go
home
it
seemed
to
me
a
lovely
thing
for
those
children
to
meet
together
to
talk
about
kindness
to
animals
they
all
had
bright
and
good
faces
and
many
of
them
stopped
to
pat
me
as
i
came
out
one
little
girl
gave
me
a
biscuit
from
her
school
bag
wood
waited
at
the
door
till
maxwell
came
limping
out
on
his
crutches
she
introduced
him
to
miss
laura
and
asked
him
if
he
go
and
take
tea
with
them
he
said
he
would
be
very
happy
to
do
so
and
then
wood
laughed
and
asked
him
if
he
had
better
empty
his
pockets
first
she
did
want
a
little
toad
jumping
over
her
tea
table
as
one
did
the
last
time
he
was
there
chapter
xxi
maxwell
and
harry
maxwell
wore
a
coat
with
loose
pockets
and
while
she
was
speaking
he
rested
on
his
crutches
and
began
to
slap
them
with
his
hands
no
there
nothing
here
he
said
i
think
i
emptied
my
pockets
before
i
went
to
the
meeting
just
as
he
said
that
there
was
a
loud
squeal
oh
my
guinea
pig
he
exclaimed
i
forgot
him
and
he
pulled
out
a
little
spotted
creature
a
few
inches
long
poor
derry
did
i
hurt
you
and
he
soothed
it
very
tenderly
i
stood
and
looked
at
maxwell
for
i
had
never
seen
any
one
like
him
he
had
thick
curly
hair
and
a
white
face
and
he
looked
just
like
a
girl
while
i
was
staring
at
him
something
peeped
up
out
of
one
of
his
pockets
and
ran
out
its
tongue
at
me
so
fast
that
i
could
scarcely
see
it
and
then
drew
back
again
i
was
thunderstruck
i
had
never
seen
such
a
creature
before
it
was
long
and
thin
like
a
boy
cane
and
of
a
bright
green
color
like
grass
and
it
had
queer
shiny
eyes
but
its
tongue
was
the
strangest
part
of
it
it
came
and
went
like
lightning
i
was
uneasy
about
it
and
began
to
bark
what
the
matter
joe
said
wood
the
pig
wo
hurt
you
but
it
was
the
pig
i
was
afraid
of
and
i
kept
on
barking
and
all
the
time
that
strange
live
thing
kept
sticking
up
its
head
and
putting
out
its
tongue
at
me
and
neither
of
them
noticed
it
its
getting
on
toward
six
said
wood
we
must
be
going
home
come
mr
maxwell
the
young
man
put
the
guinea
pig
in
his
pocket
picked
up
his
crutches
and
we
started
down
the
sunny
village
street
he
left
his
guinea
pig
at
his
boarding
house
as
he
went
by
but
he
said
nothing
about
the
other
creature
so
i
knew
he
did
not
know
it
was
there
i
was
very
much
taken
with
maxwell
he
seemed
so
bright
and
happy
in
spite
of
his
lameness
which
kept
him
from
running
about
like
other
young
men
he
looked
a
little
older
than
miss
laura
and
one
day
a
week
or
two
later
when
they
were
sitting
on
the
veranda
i
heard
him
tell
her
that
he
was
just
nineteen
he
told
her
too
that
his
lameness
made
him
love
animals
they
never
laughed
at
him
or
slighted
him
or
got
impatient
because
he
could
not
walk
quickly
they
were
always
good
to
him
and
he
said
he
loved
all
animals
while
he
liked
very
few
people
on
this
day
as
he
was
limping
along
he
said
to
wood
i
am
getting
more
every
day
have
you
heard
of
my
latest
escapade
no
she
said
i
am
glad
he
replied
i
was
afraid
that
it
would
be
all
over
the
village
by
this
time
i
went
to
church
last
sunday
with
my
poor
guinea
pig
in
my
pocket
he
has
been
well
and
i
was
attending
to
him
before
church
and
put
him
in
there
to
get
warm
and
forgot
about
him
unfortunately
i
was
late
and
the
back
seats
were
all
full
so
i
had
to
sit
farther
up
than
i
usually
do
during
the
first
hymn
i
happened
to
strike
piggy
against
the
side
of
the
seat
such
an
squeal
as
he
set
up
it
sounded
as
if
i
was
murdering
him
the
people
stared
and
stared
and
i
had
to
leave
the
church
overwhelmed
with
confusion
wood
and
miss
laura
laughed
and
then
they
got
talking
about
other
matters
that
were
not
interesting
to
me
so
i
did
not
listen
but
i
kept
close
to
miss
laura
for
i
was
afraid
that
green
thing
might
hurt
her
i
wondered
very
much
what
its
name
was
i
do
think
i
should
have
feared
it
so
much
if
i
had
known
what
it
was
there
something
the
matter
with
joe
said
miss
laura
when
we
got
into
the
lane
what
is
it
dear
old
fellow
she
put
down
her
little
hand
and
i
licked
it
and
wished
so
much
that
i
could
speak
sometimes
i
wish
very
much
that
i
had
the
gift
of
speech
and
then
at
other
times
i
see
how
little
it
would
profit
me
and
how
many
foolish
things
i
should
often
say
and
i
do
believe
human
beings
would
love
animals
as
well
if
they
could
speak
when
we
reached
the
house
we
got
a
joyful
surprise
there
was
a
trunk
standing
on
the
veranda
and
as
soon
as
wood
saw
it
she
gave
a
little
shriek
my
dear
boy
harry
was
there
sure
enough
and
stepped
out
through
the
open
door
he
took
his
mother
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
then
he
shook
hands
with
miss
laura
and
maxwell
who
seemed
to
be
an
old
friend
of
his
they
all
sat
down
on
the
veranda
and
talked
and
i
lay
at
miss
laura
feet
and
looked
at
harry
he
was
such
a
handsome
young
man
and
had
such
a
noble
face
he
was
older
and
graver
looking
than
when
i
saw
him
last
and
he
had
a
light
brown
moustache
that
he
did
not
have
when
he
was
in
fairport
he
seemed
very
fond
of
his
mother
and
of
miss
laura
and
however
grave
his
face
might
be
when
he
was
looking
at
maxwell
it
always
lighted
up
when
he
turned
to
them
what
dog
is
that
he
said
at
last
with
a
puzzled
face
and
pointing
to
me
why
harry
exclaimed
miss
laura
do
you
know
beautiful
joe
that
you
rescued
from
that
wretched
milkman
is
it
possible
he
said
that
this
creature
is
the
bundle
of
dirty
skin
and
bones
that
we
nursed
in
fairport
come
here
sir
do
you
remember
me
indeed
i
did
remember
him
and
i
licked
his
hands
and
looked
up
gratefully
into
his
face
you
almost
handsome
now
he
said
caressing
me
with
a
firm
kind
hand
and
of
a
solid
build
too
you
look
like
a
fighter
but
i
suppose
you
would
let
him
fight
even
if
he
wanted
to
laura
and
he
smiled
and
glanced
at
her
no
she
said
i
do
think
i
should
but
he
can
fight
when
the
occasion
requires
it
and
she
told
him
about
our
night
with
jenkins
all
the
time
she
was
speaking
harry
held
me
by
the
paws
and
stroked
my
body
over
and
over
again
when
she
finished
he
put
his
head
down
to
me
and
murmured
good
dog
and
i
saw
that
his
eyes
were
red
and
shining
that
a
capital
story
we
must
have
it
at
the
band
of
mercy
said
maxwell
wood
had
gone
to
help
prepare
the
tea
so
the
two
young
men
were
alone
with
miss
laura
when
they
had
done
talking
about
me
she
asked
harry
a
number
of
questions
about
his
college
life
and
his
trip
to
new
york
for
he
had
not
been
studying
all
the
time
that
he
was
away
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
yourself
gray
when
your
college
course
is
ended
asked
maxwell
i
am
going
to
settle
right
down
here
said
harry
what
be
a
farmer
asked
his
friend
yes
why
not
nothing
only
i
imagined
that
you
would
take
a
profession
the
professions
are
overstocked
and
we
have
not
farmers
enough
for
the
good
of
the
country
there
is
nothing
like
farming
to
my
mind
in
no
other
employment
have
you
a
surer
living
i
do
not
like
the
cities
the
heat
and
dust
and
crowds
of
people
and
buildings
overtopping
one
another
and
the
rush
of
living
take
my
breath
away
suppose
i
did
go
to
a
city
i
would
sell
out
my
share
of
the
farm
and
have
a
few
thousand
dollars
you
know
i
am
not
an
intellectual
giant
i
would
never
distinguish
myself
in
any
profession
i
would
be
a
poor
lawyer
or
doctor
living
in
a
back
street
all
the
days
of
my
life
and
never
watch
a
tree
or
flower
grow
or
tend
an
animal
or
have
a
drive
unless
i
paid
for
it
no
thank
you
i
agree
with
president
eliot
of
harvard
he
says
scarcely
one
person
in
ten
thousand
betters
himself
permanently
by
leaving
his
rural
home
and
settling
in
a
city
if
one
is
a
millionaire
city
life
is
agreeable
enough
for
one
can
always
get
away
from
it
but
i
am
beginning
to
think
that
it
is
a
dangerous
thing
in
more
ways
than
one
to
be
a
millionaire
i
believe
the
safety
of
the
country
lies
in
the
hands
of
the
farmers
for
they
are
seldom
very
poor
or
very
rich
we
stand
between
the
two
dangerous
classes
the
wealthy
and
the
paupers
but
most
farmers
lead
such
a
dog
life
said
maxwell
so
they
do
farming
is
made
as
attractive
as
it
should
be
said
harry
maxwell
smiled
attractive
farming
just
sketch
an
outline
of
that
will
you
gray
in
the
first
place
said
harry
i
would
like
to
tear
out
of
the
heart
of
the
farmer
the
thing
that
is
as
firmly
implanted
in
him
as
it
is
in
the
heart
of
his
city
brother
the
thing
that
is
doing
more
to
harm
our
nation
than
anything
else
under
the
sun
what
is
that
asked
maxwell
curiously
the
thirst
for
gold
the
farmer
wants
to
get
rich
and
he
works
so
hard
to
do
it
that
he
wears
himself
out
soul
and
body
and
the
young
people
around
him
get
so
disgusted
with
that
way
of
getting
rich
that
they
go
off
to
the
cities
to
find
out
some
other
way
or
at
least
to
enjoy
themselves
for
i
do
think
many
young
people
are
animated
by
a
desire
to
heap
up
money
maxwell
looked
amused
there
is
certainly
a
great
exodus
from
country
places
cityward
he
said
what
would
be
your
plan
for
checking
it
i
would
make
the
farm
so
pleasant
that
you
could
hire
the
boys
and
girls
to
leave
it
i
would
have
them
work
and
work
hard
too
but
when
their
work
was
over
i
would
let
them
have
some
fun
that
is
what
they
go
to
the
city
for
they
want
amusement
and
society
and
to
get
into
some
kind
of
a
crowd
when
their
work
is
done
the
young
men
and
young
women
want
to
get
together
as
is
only
natural
now
that
could
be
done
in
the
country
if
farmers
would
be
contented
with
smaller
profits
and
smaller
farms
their
houses
could
be
nearer
together
their
children
would
have
opportunities
of
social
intercourse
there
could
be
societies
and
clubs
and
that
would
tend
to
a
distribution
of
literature
a
farmer
ought
to
take
five
or
six
papers
and
two
or
three
magazines
he
would
find
it
would
pay
him
in
the
long
run
and
there
ought
to
be
a
law
made
compelling
him
to
go
to
the
post
office
once
a
day
maxwell
burst
out
laughing
and
another
to
make
him
mend
his
roads
as
well
as
mend
his
ways
i
tell
you
gray
the
bad
roads
would
put
an
end
to
all
these
fine
schemes
of
yours
imagine
farmers
calling
on
each
other
on
a
dark
evening
after
a
spring
freshet
i
can
see
them
mired
and
bogged
and
the
house
a
mile
ahead
of
them
that
is
true
said
harry
the
road
question
is
a
serious
one
do
you
know
how
father
and
i
settle
it
no
said
maxwell
we
got
so
tired
of
the
whole
business
and
the
farmers
around
here
spent
so
much
time
in
discussing
the
art
of
roadmaking
as
to
whether
it
should
be
viewed
from
the
engineering
point
of
view
or
the
practical
point
of
view
and
whether
we
would
require
this
number
of
stump
extractors
or
that
number
and
how
many
shovels
and
crushers
and
ditchers
would
be
necessary
to
keep
our
roads
in
order
and
so
on
that
we
simply
withdrew
we
keep
our
own
roads
in
order
once
a
year
father
gets
a
gang
of
men
and
tackles
every
section
of
the
road
that
borders
upon
our
land
and
our
roads
are
the
best
around
here
i
wish
the
government
would
take
up
this
matter
of
making
roads
and
settle
it
if
we
had
good
smooth
country
roads
such
as
they
have
in
some
parts
of
europe
we
would
be
able
to
travel
comfortably
over
them
all
through
the
year
and
our
draught
animals
would
last
longer
for
they
would
not
have
to
expend
so
much
energy
in
drawing
their
loads
chapter
xxii
what
happened
at
the
tea
table
from
my
station
under
miss
laura
chair
i
could
see
that
all
the
time
harry
was
speaking
maxwell
although
he
spoke
rather
as
if
he
was
laughing
at
him
was
yet
glancing
at
him
admiringly
when
harry
was
silent
he
exclaimed
you
are
right
you
are
right
gray
with
your
smooth
highways
and
plenty
of
schools
and
churches
and
libraries
and
meetings
for
young
people
you
would
make
country
life
a
paradise
and
i
tell
you
what
you
would
do
too
you
would
empty
the
slums
of
the
cities
it
is
the
slowness
and
dullness
of
country
life
and
not
their
poverty
alone
that
keep
the
poor
in
dirty
lanes
and
tenement
houses
they
want
stir
and
amusement
too
poor
souls
when
their
day
work
is
over
i
believe
they
would
come
to
the
country
if
it
were
made
more
pleasant
for
them
that
is
another
question
said
harry
a
burning
question
in
my
mind
the
labor
and
capital
one
when
i
was
in
new
york
maxwell
i
was
in
a
hospital
and
saw
a
number
of
men
who
had
been
day
laborers
some
of
them
were
old
and
feeble
and
others
were
young
men
broken
down
in
the
prime
of
life
their
limbs
were
shrunken
and
drawn
they
had
been
digging
in
the
earth
and
working
on
high
buildings
and
confined
in
dingy
basements
and
had
done
all
kinds
of
hard
labor
for
other
men
they
had
given
their
lives
and
strength
for
others
and
this
was
the
end
of
it
to
die
poor
and
forsaken
i
looked
at
them
and
they
reminded
me
of
the
martyrs
of
old
ground
down
living
from
hand
to
mouth
separated
from
their
families
in
many
cases
they
had
had
a
bitter
lot
they
had
never
had
a
chance
to
get
away
from
their
fate
and
had
to
work
till
they
dropped
i
tell
you
there
is
something
wrong
we
do
do
enough
for
the
people
that
slave
and
toil
for
us
we
should
take
better
care
of
them
we
should
not
herd
them
together
like
cattle
and
when
we
get
rich
we
should
carry
them
along
with
us
and
give
them
a
part
of
our
gains
for
without
them
we
would
be
as
poor
as
they
are
good
harry
i
with
you
there
said
a
voice
behind
him
and
looking
around
we
saw
wood
standing
in
the
doorway
gazing
down
proudly
at
his
harry
smiled
and
getting
up
said
wo
you
have
my
chair
sir
no
thank
you
your
mother
wishes
us
to
come
to
tea
there
are
muffins
and
you
know
they
wo
improve
with
keeping
they
all
went
to
the
and
i
followed
them
on
the
way
wood
said
right
on
top
of
that
talk
of
yours
harry
i
got
to
tell
you
of
another
person
who
is
going
to
boston
to
live
who
is
it
said
harry
lazy
dan
wilson
i
been
to
see
him
this
afternoon
you
know
his
wife
is
sick
and
they
half
starved
he
says
he
is
going
to
the
city
for
he
hates
to
chop
wood
and
work
and
he
thinks
maybe
he
get
some
light
job
there
harry
looked
grave
and
maxwell
said
he
will
starve
what
he
will
do
precisely
said
wood
spreading
out
his
hard
brown
hands
as
he
sat
down
at
the
table
i
do
know
why
it
is
but
the
present
generation
has
a
marvelous
way
of
skimming
around
any
kind
of
work
with
their
hands
they
work
their
brains
till
they
have
got
any
more
backbone
than
a
caterpillar
but
as
for
manual
labor
it
and
out
of
fashion
i
wonder
how
these
farms
would
ever
have
been
carved
out
of
the
backwoods
if
the
old
puritans
had
sat
down
on
the
rocks
with
their
noses
in
a
lot
of
books
and
tried
to
figure
out
just
how
little
work
they
could
do
and
yet
exist
now
father
said
wood
you
are
trying
to
insinuate
that
the
present
generation
is
lazy
and
i
sure
it
is
look
at
harry
he
works
as
hard
as
you
do
is
that
like
a
woman
said
wood
with
a
laugh
the
present
generation
consists
of
her
son
and
the
past
of
her
husband
i
do
think
all
our
young
people
are
lazy
hattie
but
how
in
creation
unless
the
lord
rains
down
a
few
farmers
are
we
going
to
support
all
our
young
lawyers
and
doctors
they
say
the
world
is
getting
healthier
and
better
but
we
got
to
fight
a
little
more
and
raise
some
more
criminals
and
we
got
to
take
to
eating
pies
and
doughnuts
for
breakfast
again
or
some
of
our
young
sprouts
from
the
colleges
will
go
a
begging
you
do
mean
to
undervalue
the
advantages
of
a
good
education
do
you
mr
wood
said
maxwell
no
no
look
at
harry
there
is
he
pegging
away
at
his
studies
with
my
hearty
approval
and
he
going
to
be
nothing
but
a
plain
common
farmer
but
he
be
a
better
one
than
i
been
though
because
got
a
trained
mind
i
found
that
out
when
he
was
a
lad
going
to
the
village
school
he
lay
out
his
little
garden
by
geometry
and
dig
his
ditches
by
algebra
education
a
help
to
any
man
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is
this
that
in
some
way
or
other
we
running
more
to
brains
and
less
to
hard
work
than
our
forefathers
did
wood
was
beating
on
the
table
with
his
forefinger
while
he
talked
and
every
one
was
laughing
at
him
when
you
quite
finished
speechifying
john
said
wood
perhaps
you
serve
the
berries
and
pass
the
cream
and
sugar
do
you
get
yellow
cream
like
this
in
the
village
mr
maxwell
no
wood
he
said
ours
is
a
much
paler
yellow
and
then
there
was
a
great
tinkling
of
china
and
passing
of
dishes
and
talking
and
laughing
and
no
one
noticed
that
i
was
not
in
my
usual
place
in
the
hall
i
could
not
get
over
my
dread
of
the
green
creature
and
i
had
crept
under
the
table
so
that
if
it
came
out
and
frightened
miss
laura
i
could
jump
up
and
catch
it
when
tea
was
half
over
she
gave
a
little
cry
i
sprang
up
on
her
lap
and
there
gliding
over
the
table
toward
her
was
the
green
thing
i
stepped
on
the
table
and
had
it
by
the
middle
before
it
could
get
to
her
my
hind
legs
were
in
a
dish
of
jelly
and
my
front
ones
were
in
a
plate
of
cake
and
i
was
very
uncomfortable
the
tail
of
the
green
thing
hung
in
a
milk
pitcher
and
its
tongue
was
still
going
at
me
but
i
held
it
firmly
and
stood
quite
still
drop
it
drop
it
cried
miss
laura
in
tones
of
distress
and
maxwell
struck
me
on
the
back
so
i
let
the
thing
go
and
stood
sheepishly
looking
about
me
wood
was
leaning
back
in
his
chair
laughing
with
all
his
might
and
wood
was
staring
at
her
untidy
table
with
rather
a
long
face
miss
laura
told
me
to
jump
on
the
floor
and
then
she
helped
her
aunt
to
take
the
spoiled
things
off
the
table
i
felt
that
i
had
done
wrong
so
i
slunk
out
into
the
hall
maxwell
was
sitting
on
the
lounge
tearing
his
handkerchief
in
strips
and
tying
them
around
the
creature
where
my
teeth
had
stuck
in
i
had
been
careful
not
to
hurt
it
much
for
i
knew
it
was
a
pet
of
his
but
he
did
not
know
that
and
scowled
at
me
saying
you
rascal
you
hurt
my
poor
snake
terribly
i
felt
so
badly
to
hear
this
that
i
went
and
stood
with
my
head
in
a
corner
i
had
almost
rather
be
whipped
than
scolded
after
a
while
maxwell
went
back
into
the
room
and
they
all
went
on
with
their
tea
i
could
hear
wood
loud
cheery
voice
the
dog
did
quite
right
a
snake
is
mostly
a
poisonous
creature
and
his
instinct
told
him
to
protect
his
mistress
where
is
he
joe
joe
i
would
not
move
till
miss
laura
came
and
spoke
to
me
dear
old
dog
she
whispered
you
knew
the
snake
was
there
all
the
time
did
you
her
words
made
me
feel
better
and
i
followed
her
to
the
dining
room
where
wood
made
me
sit
beside
him
and
eat
scraps
from
his
hand
all
through
the
meal
maxwell
had
got
over
his
ill
humor
and
was
chatting
in
a
lively
way
good
joe
he
said
i
was
cross
to
you
and
i
beg
your
pardon
it
always
riles
me
to
have
any
of
my
pets
injured
you
did
know
my
poor
snake
was
only
after
something
to
eat
wood
has
pinned
him
in
my
pocket
so
he
wo
come
out
again
do
you
know
where
i
got
that
snake
mrs
wood
no
she
said
you
never
told
me
it
was
across
the
river
by
blue
ridge
he
said
one
day
last
summer
i
was
out
rowing
and
getting
very
hot
tied
my
boat
in
the
shade
of
a
big
tree
some
village
boys
were
in
the
woods
and
hearing
a
great
noise
i
went
to
see
what
it
was
all
about
they
were
band
of
mercy
boys
and
finding
a
country
boy
beating
a
snake
to
death
they
were
remonstrating
with
him
for
his
cruelty
telling
him
that
some
kinds
of
snakes
were
a
help
to
the
farmer
and
destroyed
large
numbers
of
field
mice
and
other
vermin
the
boy
was
obstinate
he
had
found
the
snake
and
he
insisted
upon
his
right
to
kill
it
and
they
were
having
rather
a
lively
time
when
i
appeared
i
persuaded
them
to
make
the
snake
over
to
me
apparently
it
was
already
dead
thinking
it
might
revive
i
put
it
on
some
grass
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
it
lay
there
motionless
for
a
long
time
and
i
picked
up
my
oars
and
started
for
home
i
had
got
half
way
across
the
river
when
i
turned
around
and
saw
that
the
snake
was
gone
it
had
just
dropped
into
the
water
and
was
swimming
toward
the
bank
we
had
left
i
turned
and
followed
it
it
swam
slowly
and
with
evident
pain
lifting
its
head
every
few
seconds
high
above
the
water
to
see
which
way
it
was
going
on
reaching
the
bank
it
coiled
itself
up
throwing
up
blood
and
water
i
took
it
up
carefully
carried
it
home
and
nursed
it
it
soon
got
better
and
has
been
a
pet
of
mine
ever
since
after
tea
was
over
and
wood
and
miss
laura
had
helped
adele
finish
the
work
they
all
gathered
in
the
parlor
the
day
had
been
quite
warm
but
now
a
cool
wind
had
sprung
up
and
wood
said
that
it
was
blowing
up
rain
wood
said
that
she
thought
a
fire
would
be
pleasant
so
they
lighted
the
sticks
of
wood
in
the
open
grate
and
all
sat
round
the
blazing
fire
maxwell
tried
to
get
me
to
make
friends
with
the
little
snake
that
he
held
in
his
hands
toward
the
blaze
and
now
that
i
knew
that
it
was
harmless
i
was
not
afraid
of
it
but
it
did
not
like
me
and
put
out
its
funny
little
tongue
whenever
i
looked
at
it
the
rain
began
to
strike
against
the
windows
and
maxwell
said
this
is
just
the
night
for
a
story
tell
us
something
out
of
your
experience
wo
you
mr
wood
what
shall
i
tell
you
he
said
he
was
sitting
between
his
wife
and
harry
and
had
his
hand
on
harry
knee
something
about
animals
said
maxwell
we
seem
to
be
on
that
subject
well
said
wood
i
talk
about
something
that
has
been
running
in
my
head
for
many
a
day
there
is
a
good
deal
of
talk
nowadays
about
kindness
to
domestic
animals
but
i
do
not
hear
much
about
kindness
to
wild
ones
the
same
creator
formed
them
both
i
do
not
see
why
you
should
not
protect
one
as
well
as
the
other
i
have
no
more
right
to
torture
a
bear
than
a
cow
our
wild
animals
around
here
are
getting
pretty
well
killed
off
but
there
are
lots
in
other
places
i
used
to
be
fond
of
hunting
when
i
was
a
boy
but
i
have
got
rather
disgusted
with
killing
these
late
years
and
unless
the
wild
creatures
ran
in
our
streets
i
would
lift
no
hand
to
them
shall
i
tell
you
some
of
the
sport
we
had
when
i
was
a
youngster
yes
yes
they
all
exclaimed
chapter
xxiii
trapping
wild
animals
well
wood
began
i
was
brought
up
as
you
all
know
in
the
eastern
part
of
maine
and
we
often
used
to
go
over
into
new
brunswick
for
our
sport
moose
were
our
best
game
did
you
ever
see
one
laura
no
uncle
she
said
well
when
i
was
a
boy
there
was
no
more
beautiful
sight
to
me
in
the
world
than
a
moose
with
his
dusky
hide
and
long
legs
and
branching
antlers
and
shoulders
standing
higher
than
a
horse
their
legs
are
so
long
that
they
ca
eat
close
to
the
ground
they
browse
on
the
tops
of
plants
and
the
tender
shoots
and
leaves
of
trees
they
walk
among
the
thick
underbrush
carrying
their
horns
adroitly
to
prevent
their
catching
in
the
branches
and
they
step
so
well
and
aim
so
true
that
you
scarcely
hear
a
twig
fall
as
they
go
they
a
timid
creature
except
at
times
then
they
attack
with
hoofs
and
antlers
whatever
comes
in
their
way
they
hate
mosquitoes
and
when
they
tormented
by
them
it
just
as
well
to
be
careful
about
approaching
them
like
all
other
creatures
the
lord
has
put
into
them
a
wonderful
amount
of
sense
and
when
a
female
moose
has
her
one
or
two
fawns
she
goes
into
the
deepest
part
of
the
forest
or
swims
to
islands
in
large
lakes
till
they
are
able
to
look
out
for
themselves
well
we
used
to
like
to
catch
a
moose
and
we
had
different
ways
of
doing
it
one
way
was
to
snare
them
we
d
make
a
loop
in
a
rope
and
hide
it
on
the
ground
under
the
dead
leaves
in
one
of
their
paths
this
was
connected
with
a
young
sapling
whose
top
was
bent
down
when
the
moose
stepped
on
the
loop
it
would
release
the
sapling
and
up
it
would
bound
catching
him
by
the
leg
these
snares
were
always
set
deep
in
the
woods
and
we
could
visit
them
very
often
sometimes
the
moose
would
be
there
for
days
raging
and
tearing
around
and
scratching
the
skin
off
his
legs
that
was
cruel
i
would
catch
a
moose
in
that
way
now
for
a
hundred
dollars
another
way
was
to
hunt
them
on
snow
shoes
with
dogs
in
february
and
march
the
snow
was
deep
and
would
carry
men
and
dogs
moose
do
go
together
in
herds
in
the
summer
they
wander
about
over
the
forest
and
in
the
autumn
they
come
together
in
small
groups
and
select
a
hundred
or
two
of
acres
where
there
is
plenty
of
heavy
undergrowth
and
to
which
they
usually
confine
themselves
they
do
this
so
that
their
tracks
tell
their
enemies
where
they
are
any
of
these
places
where
there
were
several
moose
we
called
a
moose
yard
we
went
through
the
woods
till
we
got
on
to
the
tracks
of
some
of
the
animals
belonging
to
it
then
the
dogs
smelled
them
and
went
ahead
to
start
them
if
i
shut
my
eyes
now
i
can
see
one
of
our
moose
hunts
the
moose
running
and
plunging
through
the
snow
crust
and
occasionally
rising
up
and
striking
at
the
dogs
that
hang
on
to
his
bleeding
flanks
and
legs
the
hunters
rifles
going
crack
crack
crack
sometimes
killing
or
wounding
dogs
as
well
as
moose
that
too
was
cruel
two
other
ways
we
had
of
hunting
moose
calling
and
stalking
the
calling
was
done
in
this
way
we
took
a
bit
of
birch
bark
and
rolled
it
up
in
the
shape
of
a
horn
we
took
this
horn
and
started
out
either
on
a
bright
moonlight
night
or
just
at
evening
or
early
in
the
morning
the
man
who
carried
the
horn
hid
himself
and
then
began
to
make
a
lowing
sound
like
a
female
moose
he
had
to
do
it
pretty
well
to
deceive
them
away
in
the
distance
some
moose
would
hear
it
and
with
answering
grunts
would
start
off
to
come
to
it
if
a
young
male
moose
was
coming
he
mind
his
steps
i
can
assure
you
on
account
of
fear
of
the
old
ones
but
if
it
was
an
old
fellow
you
hear
him
stepping
out
bravely
and
rapping
his
horns
against
the
trees
and
plunging
into
any
water
that
came
in
his
way
when
he
got
pretty
near
he
stop
to
listen
and
then
the
caller
had
to
be
very
careful
and
put
his
trumpet
down
close
to
the
ground
so
as
to
make
a
lower
sound
if
the
moose
felt
doubtful
turn
if
not
he
come
on
and
unlucky
for
him
if
he
did
for
he
got
a
warm
reception
either
from
the
rifles
in
our
hands
as
we
lay
hid
near
the
caller
or
from
some
of
the
party
stationed
at
a
distance
in
stalking
we
crept
on
them
the
way
a
cat
creeps
on
a
mouse
in
the
daytime
a
moose
is
usually
lying
down
we
find
their
tracks
and
places
where
they
been
nipping
off
the
ends
of
branches
and
twigs
and
follow
them
up
they
easily
take
the
scent
of
men
and
we
have
to
keep
well
to
the
leeward
sometimes
we
come
upon
them
lying
down
but
if
in
walking
along
we
broken
a
twig
or
made
the
slightest
noise
think
it
was
one
of
their
mortal
enemies
a
bear
creeping
on
them
and
they
be
up
and
away
their
sense
of
hearing
is
very
keen
but
not
so
quick
to
see
a
fox
is
like
that
too
his
eyes
are
equal
to
his
nose
stalking
is
the
most
merciful
way
to
kill
a
moose
then
they
the
fright
and
suffering
of
the
chase
i
do
see
why
they
need
to
be
killed
at
all
said
wood
if
i
knew
that
forest
back
of
the
mountains
was
full
of
wild
creatures
i
think
i
be
glad
of
it
and
not
want
to
hunt
them
that
is
if
they
were
harmless
and
beautiful
creatures
like
the
deer
you
a
woman
said
wood
and
women
are
more
merciful
than
men
men
want
to
kill
and
slay
they
like
the
englishman
who
said
a
fine
day
it
is
let
go
out
and
kill
something
please
tell
us
some
more
about
the
dogs
that
helped
you
catch
the
moose
uncle
said
miss
laura
i
was
sitting
up
very
straight
beside
her
listening
to
every
word
wood
said
and
she
was
fondling
my
head
well
laura
when
we
camped
out
on
the
snow
and
slept
on
spruce
boughs
while
we
were
after
the
moose
the
dogs
used
to
be
a
great
comfort
to
us
they
slept
at
our
feet
and
kept
us
warm
poor
brutes
they
mostly
had
a
rough
time
of
it
they
enjoyed
the
running
and
chasing
as
much
as
we
did
but
when
it
came
to
broken
ribs
and
sore
heads
it
was
another
matter
then
the
porcupines
bothered
them
our
dogs
would
never
learn
to
let
them
alone
if
they
were
going
through
the
woods
where
there
were
no
signs
of
moose
and
found
a
porcupine
they
kill
it
the
quills
would
get
in
their
mouths
and
necks
and
chests
and
we
have
to
gag
them
and
take
bullet
molds
or
nippers
or
whatever
we
had
sometimes
our
and
pull
out
the
nasty
things
if
we
got
hold
of
the
dogs
at
once
we
could
pull
out
the
quills
with
our
fingers
sometimes
the
quills
had
worked
in
and
the
dogs
would
go
home
and
lie
by
the
fire
with
running
sores
till
they
worked
out
i
seen
quills
work
right
through
dogs
go
in
on
one
side
and
come
out
on
the
other
poor
brutes
said
wood
i
wonder
you
took
them
we
once
lost
a
valuable
hound
while
moose
hunting
said
wood
the
moose
struck
him
with
his
hoof
and
the
dog
was
terribly
injured
and
lay
in
the
woods
for
days
till
a
neighbor
of
ours
who
was
looking
for
timber
found
him
and
brought
him
home
on
his
shoulders
was
there
rejoicing
among
us
boys
to
see
old
lion
coming
back
we
took
care
of
him
and
he
got
well
again
it
was
good
sport
to
see
the
dogs
when
we
were
hunting
a
bear
with
them
bears
are
good
runners
and
when
dogs
get
after
them
there
is
great
skirmishing
they
nip
the
bear
behind
and
when
they
turn
the
dogs
run
like
mad
for
a
hug
from
a
bear
means
sure
death
to
a
dog
if
they
got
a
slap
from
his
paws
over
they
go
dogs
new
to
the
business
were
often
killed
by
the
bears
were
there
many
bears
near
your
home
mr
wood
asked
maxwell
lots
of
them
more
than
we
wanted
they
used
to
bother
us
fearfully
about
our
sheep
and
cattle
i
often
had
to
get
up
in
the
night
and
run
out
to
the
cattle
the
bears
would
come
out
of
the
woods
and
jump
on
to
the
young
heifers
and
cows
and
strike
them
and
beat
them
down
and
the
cattle
would
roar
as
if
the
evil
one
had
them
if
the
cattle
were
too
far
away
from
the
house
for
us
to
hear
them
the
bears
would
worry
them
till
they
were
dead
as
for
the
sheep
they
never
made
any
resistance
they
meekly
run
in
a
corner
when
they
saw
a
bear
coming
and
huddle
together
and
strike
at
them
and
scratch
them
with
his
claws
and
perhaps
wound
a
dozen
before
he
got
one
firmly
then
he
seize
it
in
his
paws
and
walk
off
on
his
hind
legs
over
fences
and
anything
else
that
came
in
his
way
till
he
came
to
a
nice
retired
spot
and
there
he
d
sit
down
and
skin
that
sheep
just
like
a
butcher
he
gorge
himself
with
the
meat
and
in
the
morning
we
find
the
other
sheep
that
he
torn
and
we
vow
vengeance
against
that
bear
he
be
almost
sure
to
come
back
for
more
so
for
a
while
after
that
we
always
put
the
sheep
in
the
barn
at
nights
and
set
a
trap
by
the
remains
of
the
one
he
had
eaten
everybody
hated
bears
and
had
much
pity
for
them
still
they
were
only
getting
their
meat
as
other
wild
animals
do
and
we
no
right
to
set
such
cruel
traps
for
them
as
the
steel
ones
they
had
a
clog
attached
to
them
and
had
long
sharp
teeth
we
put
them
on
the
ground
and
strewed
leaves
over
them
and
hung
up
some
of
the
carcass
left
by
the
bear
near
by
when
he
attempted
to
get
this
meat
he
would
tread
on
the
trap
and
the
teeth
would
spring
together
and
catch
him
by
the
leg
they
always
fought
to
get
free
i
once
saw
a
bear
that
had
been
making
a
desperate
effort
to
get
away
his
leg
was
broken
the
skin
and
flesh
were
all
torn
away
and
he
was
held
by
the
tendons
it
was
a
foreleg
that
was
caught
and
he
would
put
his
hind
feet
against
the
jaws
of
the
trap
and
then
draw
by
pressing
with
his
feet
till
he
would
stretch
those
tendons
to
their
utmost
extent
i
have
known
them
to
work
away
till
they
really
pulled
these
tendons
out
of
the
foot
and
got
off
it
was
a
great
event
in
our
neighborhood
when
a
bear
was
caught
whoever
caught
him
blew
a
horn
and
the
men
and
boys
came
trooping
together
to
see
the
sight
i
known
them
to
blow
that
horn
on
a
sunday
morning
and
i
seen
the
men
turn
their
backs
on
the
meeting
house
to
go
and
see
the
bear
was
there
no
more
merciful
way
of
catching
them
than
by
this
trap
asked
miss
laura
oh
yes
by
the
deadfall
that
is
by
driving
heavy
sticks
into
the
ground
and
making
a
place
open
on
one
side
where
two
logs
were
so
arranged
with
other
heavy
logs
upon
them
that
when
the
bear
seized
the
bait
the
upper
log
fell
down
and
crushed
him
to
death
another
way
was
to
fix
a
bait
in
a
certain
place
with
cords
tied
to
it
which
cords
were
fastened
to
triggers
of
guns
placed
at
a
little
distance
when
the
bear
took
the
bait
the
guns
went
off
and
he
shot
himself
sometimes
it
took
a
good
many
bullets
to
kill
them
i
remember
one
old
fellow
that
we
put
eleven
into
before
he
keeled
over
it
was
one
fall
over
on
pike
hill
the
snow
had
come
earlier
than
usual
and
this
old
bear
had
got
into
his
den
for
his
winter
sleep
a
lot
of
us
started
out
after
him
the
hill
was
covered
with
beech
trees
and
he
been
living
all
the
fall
on
the
nuts
till
he
got
as
fat
as
butter
we
took
dogs
and
worried
him
and
ran
him
from
one
place
to
another
and
shot
at
him
till
at
last
he
dropped
we
took
his
meat
home
and
had
his
skin
tanned
for
a
sleigh
robe
one
day
i
was
in
the
woods
and
looking
through
the
trees
espied
a
bear
he
was
standing
up
on
his
hind
legs
snuffing
in
every
direction
and
just
about
the
time
i
espied
him
he
espied
me
i
had
no
dog
and
no
gun
so
i
thought
i
had
better
be
getting
home
to
my
dinner
i
was
a
small
boy
then
and
the
bear
probably
thinking
i
be
a
mouthful
for
him
anyway
began
to
come
after
me
in
a
leisurely
way
i
can
see
myself
now
going
through
those
woods
hat
gone
jacket
flying
arms
out
eyes
rolling
over
my
shoulder
every
little
while
to
see
if
the
bear
was
gaining
on
me
he
was
a
old
fellow
and
his
face
seemed
to
say
hurry
little
boy
he
was
doing
his
prettiest
and
i
soon
got
away
from
him
but
i
made
up
my
mind
then
that
it
was
more
fun
to
be
the
chaser
than
the
chased
another
time
i
was
out
in
our
cornfield
and
hearing
a
rustling
looked
through
the
stalks
and
saw
a
brown
bear
with
two
cubs
she
was
slashing
down
the
corn
with
her
paws
to
get
at
the
ears
she
smelled
me
and
getting
frightened
began
to
run
i
had
a
dog
with
me
this
time
and
shouted
and
rapped
on
the
fence
and
set
him
on
her
he
jumped
up
and
snapped
at
her
flanks
and
every
few
instants
she
turn
and
give
him
a
cuff
that
would
send
him
yards
away
i
followed
her
up
and
just
back
of
the
farm
she
and
her
cubs
took
into
a
tree
i
sent
my
dog
home
and
my
father
and
some
of
the
neighbors
came
it
had
gotten
dark
by
this
time
so
we
built
a
fire
under
the
tree
and
watched
all
night
and
told
stories
to
keep
each
other
awake
toward
morning
we
got
sleepy
and
the
fire
burnt
low
and
did
that
old
bear
and
one
cub
drop
right
down
among
us
and
start
off
to
the
woods
that
waked
us
up
we
built
up
the
fire
and
kept
watch
so
that
the
one
cub
still
in
the
tree
get
away
until
daylight
the
mother
bear
hung
around
calling
to
the
cub
to
come
down
did
you
let
it
go
uncle
asked
miss
laura
no
my
dear
we
shot
it
how
cruel
cried
wood
yes
were
we
brutes
said
her
husband
but
there
was
some
excuse
for
us
hattie
the
bears
ruined
our
farms
this
kind
of
hunting
that
hunts
and
kills
for
the
mere
sake
of
slaughter
is
very
different
from
that
i
tell
you
what
i
no
patience
with
and
that
with
these
english
folks
that
dress
themselves
up
and
take
fine
horses
and
packs
of
dogs
and
tear
over
the
country
after
one
little
fox
or
rabbit
bah
it
contemptible
now
if
they
were
hunting
cruel
tigers
or
animals
that
destroy
property
it
would
be
a
different
thing
chapter
xxiv
the
rabbit
and
the
hen
you
had
foxes
up
in
maine
i
suppose
wood
had
you
asked
maxwell
heaps
of
them
i
always
want
to
laugh
when
i
think
of
our
foxes
for
they
were
so
cute
never
a
fox
did
i
catch
in
a
trap
though
i
set
many
a
one
i
take
the
carcass
of
some
creature
that
had
died
a
sheep
for
instance
and
put
it
in
a
field
near
the
woods
and
the
foxes
would
come
and
eat
it
after
they
got
accustomed
to
come
and
eat
and
no
harm
befell
them
they
would
be
unsuspecting
so
just
before
a
snowstorm
i
take
a
trap
and
put
it
in
this
spot
i
handle
it
with
gloves
and
i
smoke
it
and
rub
fir
boughs
on
it
to
take
away
the
human
smell
and
then
the
snow
would
come
and
cover
it
up
and
yet
those
foxes
would
know
it
was
a
trap
and
walk
all
around
it
it
a
wonderful
thing
that
sense
of
smell
in
animals
if
it
is
a
sense
of
smell
joe
here
has
got
a
good
bit
of
it
what
kind
of
traps
were
they
father
asked
harry
cruel
ones
steel
ones
they
catch
an
animal
by
the
leg
and
sometimes
break
the
bone
the
leg
would
bleed
and
below
the
jaws
of
he
trap
it
would
freeze
there
being
no
circulation
of
the
blood
those
steel
traps
are
an
abomination
the
people
around
here
use
one
made
on
the
same
principle
for
catching
rats
i
would
have
them
on
my
place
for
any
money
i
believe
we
got
to
give
an
account
for
all
the
unnecessary
suffering
we
put
on
animals
you
have
some
to
answer
for
john
according
to
your
own
story
said
wood
i
have
suffered
already
he
said
many
a
night
i
lain
on
my
bed
and
groaned
when
i
thought
of
needless
cruelties
i
put
upon
animals
when
i
was
a
young
unthinking
boy
and
i
was
pretty
carefully
brought
up
too
according
to
our
light
in
those
days
i
often
think
that
if
i
was
cruel
with
all
the
instruction
i
had
to
be
merciful
what
can
be
expected
of
the
children
that
get
no
good
teaching
at
all
when
young
tell
us
some
more
about
the
foxes
wood
said
maxwell
well
we
used
to
have
rare
sport
hunting
them
with
often
go
off
for
the
day
with
my
hounds
sometimes
in
the
early
morning
they
find
a
track
in
the
snow
the
leader
for
scent
would
go
back
and
forth
to
find
out
which
way
the
fox
was
going
i
can
see
him
now
all
the
time
that
he
ran
now
one
way
and
now
another
on
the
track
of
the
fox
he
was
silent
but
kept
his
tail
aloft
wagging
it
as
a
signal
to
the
hounds
behind
he
was
leader
in
scent
but
he
did
not
like
bloody
dangerous
fights
he
would
decide
which
way
the
fox
had
gone
then
his
tail
still
kept
high
in
the
air
would
wag
more
violently
the
rest
followed
him
in
single
file
going
pretty
slow
so
as
to
enable
us
to
keep
up
to
them
they
would
come
to
a
place
where
the
fox
was
sleeping
for
the
day
as
soon
as
he
was
disturbed
he
would
leave
his
bed
under
some
thick
fir
or
spruce
branches
near
the
ground
this
flung
his
fresh
scent
into
the
air
as
soon
as
the
hounds
sniffed
it
they
gave
tongue
in
good
earnest
it
was
a
mixed
deep
baying
that
made
the
blood
quicken
in
my
veins
while
in
the
excitement
of
his
first
fright
the
fox
would
run
fast
for
a
mile
or
two
till
he
found
it
an
easy
matter
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
hounds
then
he
cunning
creature
would
begin
to
bother
them
he
would
mount
to
the
top
pole
of
the
worm
fence
dividing
the
fields
from
the
woods
he
could
trot
along
here
quite
a
distance
and
then
make
a
long
jump
into
the
woods
the
hounds
would
come
up
but
could
not
walk
the
fence
and
they
would
have
difficulty
in
finding
where
the
fox
had
left
it
then
we
saw
generalship
the
hounds
scattered
in
all
directions
and
made
long
detours
into
the
woods
and
fields
as
soon
as
the
track
was
lost
they
ceased
to
bay
but
the
instant
a
hound
found
it
again
he
bayed
to
give
the
signal
to
the
others
all
would
hurry
to
the
spot
and
off
they
would
go
baying
as
they
went
then
fox
would
try
a
new
trick
he
would
climb
a
leaning
tree
and
then
jump
to
the
ground
this
trick
would
soon
be
found
out
then
try
another
he
would
make
a
circle
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
circumference
by
making
a
loop
in
his
course
he
would
come
in
behind
the
hounds
and
puzzle
them
between
the
scent
of
his
first
and
following
tracks
if
the
snow
was
deep
the
hounds
had
made
a
good
track
for
him
over
this
he
could
run
easily
and
they
would
have
to
feel
their
way
along
for
after
he
had
gone
around
the
circle
a
few
times
he
would
jump
from
the
beaten
path
as
far
as
he
could
and
make
off
to
other
cover
in
a
straight
line
before
this
was
done
it
was
my
plan
to
get
near
the
circle
taking
care
to
approach
it
on
the
leeward
side
if
the
fox
got
a
sniff
of
human
scent
he
would
leave
his
circle
very
quickly
and
make
tracks
fast
to
be
out
of
danger
by
the
baying
of
the
hounds
the
circle
in
which
the
race
was
kept
up
could
be
easily
known
the
last
runs
to
get
near
enough
to
shoot
had
to
be
done
when
the
hounds
baying
came
from
the
side
of
the
circle
nearest
to
me
for
then
the
fox
would
be
on
the
opposite
side
farthest
away
as
soon
as
i
got
near
enough
to
see
the
hounds
when
they
passed
i
stopped
when
they
got
on
the
opposite
side
i
then
kept
a
bright
lookout
for
the
fox
sometimes
when
the
brush
was
thick
the
sight
of
him
would
be
indistinct
the
shooting
had
to
be
quick
as
soon
as
the
report
of
the
gun
was
heard
the
hounds
ceased
to
bay
and
made
for
the
spot
if
the
fox
was
dead
they
enjoyed
the
scent
of
his
blood
if
only
wounded
they
went
after
him
with
all
speed
sometimes
he
was
overtaken
and
killed
and
sometimes
he
got
into
his
burrow
in
the
earth
or
in
a
hollow
log
or
among
the
rocks
one
day
i
remember
when
i
was
standing
on
the
outside
of
the
circle
the
fox
came
in
sight
i
fired
he
gave
a
shrill
bark
and
came
toward
me
then
he
stopped
in
the
snow
and
fell
dead
in
his
tracks
i
was
a
pretty
good
shot
in
those
days
poor
little
fox
said
miss
laura
i
wish
you
had
let
him
get
away
here
one
that
nearly
got
away
said
wood
one
winter
day
i
was
chasing
him
with
the
hounds
there
was
a
crust
on
the
snow
and
the
fox
was
light
while
the
dogs
were
heavy
they
ran
along
the
fox
trotting
nimbly
on
the
top
of
the
crust
and
the
dogs
breaking
through
and
every
few
minutes
that
fox
would
stop
and
sit
down
to
look
at
the
dogs
they
were
in
a
fury
and
the
wickedness
of
the
fox
in
teasing
them
made
me
laugh
so
much
that
i
was
very
unwilling
to
shoot
him
you
said
your
steel
traps
were
cruel
things
uncle
said
miss
laura
why
did
you
have
a
deadfall
for
the
foxes
as
you
had
for
the
bears
they
were
too
cunning
to
go
into
deadfalls
there
was
a
better
way
to
catch
them
though
foxes
hate
water
and
never
go
into
it
unless
they
are
obliged
to
so
we
used
to
find
a
place
where
a
tree
had
fallen
across
a
river
and
made
a
bridge
for
them
to
go
back
and
forth
on
here
we
set
snares
with
spring
poles
that
would
throw
them
into
the
river
when
they
made
struggles
to
get
free
and
drown
them
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
fox
laura
that
wanted
to
cross
a
river
and
lay
down
on
the
bank
pretending
that
he
was
dead
and
a
countryman
came
along
and
thinking
he
had
a
prize
threw
him
in
his
boat
and
rowed
across
when
the
fox
got
up
and
ran
away
now
uncle
said
miss
laura
you
laughing
at
me
that
could
be
true
no
no
said
wood
chuckling
but
they
mighty
cute
at
pretending
they
dead
i
once
shot
one
in
the
morning
carried
him
a
long
way
on
my
shoulders
and
started
to
skin
him
in
the
afternoon
when
he
turned
around
and
bit
me
enough
to
draw
blood
at
another
time
i
dug
one
out
of
a
hole
in
the
ground
he
feigned
death
i
took
him
up
and
threw
him
down
at
some
distance
and
he
jumped
up
and
ran
into
the
woods
what
other
animals
did
you
catch
when
you
were
a
boy
asked
maxwell
oh
a
number
otters
and
beavers
we
caught
them
in
deadfalls
and
in
steel
traps
the
mink
we
usually
took
in
deadfalls
smaller
of
course
than
the
ones
we
used
for
the
bears
the
we
caught
in
box
traps
like
a
mouse
trap
the
we
ran
down
like
the
cervier
what
kind
of
an
animal
is
that
asked
maxwell
it
is
a
lynx
belonging
to
the
cat
species
they
used
to
prowl
about
the
country
killing
hens
geese
and
sometimes
sheep
they
fix
their
tushes
in
the
sheep
neck
and
suck
the
blood
they
did
not
think
much
of
the
sheep
flesh
we
ran
them
down
with
dogs
they
often
run
up
trees
and
we
shoot
them
then
there
were
rabbits
that
we
caught
mostly
in
snares
for
we
put
a
parsnip
or
an
apple
on
the
spindle
of
a
box
trap
when
we
snared
a
rabbit
i
always
wanted
to
find
it
caught
around
the
neck
and
strangled
to
death
if
they
got
half
through
the
snare
and
were
caught
around
the
body
or
by
the
hind
legs
they
live
for
some
time
and
they
cry
just
like
a
child
i
like
shooting
them
better
just
because
i
hated
to
hear
their
pitiful
cries
it
a
bad
business
this
of
killing
dumb
creatures
and
the
older
i
get
the
more
i
am
about
it
i
should
think
you
are
said
wood
do
you
know
laura
he
wo
even
kill
a
fowl
for
dinner
he
gives
it
to
one
of
the
men
to
do
blessed
are
the
merciful
said
miss
laura
throwing
her
arm
over
her
uncle
shoulder
i
love
you
dear
uncle
john
because
you
are
so
kind
to
every
living
thing

said
her
uncle
and
send
you
to
bed

tired
very
well
she
said
with
a
smile
then
bidding
them
all
she
went
upstairs
wood
turned
to
maxwell

to
stay
all
night
with
us

replied
the
young
man
with
a
smile
of
course
she
said
i

think
of
letting

go
back
to
the
village
such
a
night
as

cats

dogs

to
harry
and
she
bustled
away
the
two
young
men
went
to
the
pantry
for
doughnuts
and
milk
and
wood
stood
gazing
down
at
me
good
dog
he
said
you
look
as
if
you
sensed
that
talk
come
get
a
bone
and
then
away
to
bed
he
gave
me
a
very
large
mutton
bone
and
i
held
it
in
my
mouth
and
watched
him
opening
the
woodshed
door
i
love
human
beings
and
the
saddest
time
of
day
for
me
is
when
i
have
to
be
separated
from
them
while
they
sleep
now
go
to
bed
and
rest
well
beautiful
joe
said
wood
and
if
you
hear
any
stranger
round
the
house
run
out
and
bark
do
be
chasing
wild
animals
in
your
sleep
though
they
say
a
dog
is
the
only
animal
that
dreams
i
wonder
whether
it
true
then
he
went
into
the
house
and
shut
the
door
i
had
a
sheepskin
to
lie
on
and
a
very
good
bed
it
made
i
slept
soundly
for
a
long
time
then
i
waked
up
and
found
that
instead
of
rain
pattering
against
the
roof
and
darkness
everywhere
it
was
quite
light
the
rain
was
over
and
the
moon
was
shining
beautifully
i
ran
to
the
door
and
looked
out
it
was
almost
as
light
as
day
the
moon
made
it
very
bright
all
around
the
house
and
farm
buildings
and
i
could
look
all
about
and
see
that
there
was
no
one
stirring
i
took
a
turn
around
the
yard
and
walked
around
to
the
side
of
the
house
to
glance
up
at
miss
laura
window
i
always
did
this
several
times
through
the
night
just
to
see
if
she
was
quite
safe
i
was
on
my
way
back
to
my
bed
when
i
saw
two
small
white
things
moving
away
down
the
lane
i
stood
on
the
veranda
and
watched
them
when
they
got
nearer
i
saw
that
there
was
a
white
rabbit
hopping
up
the
road
followed
by
a
white
hen
it
seemed
to
me
a
very
strange
thing
for
these
creatures
to
be
out
this
time
of
night
and
why
were
they
coming
to
dingley
farm
this
their
home
i
ran
down
on
the
road
and
stood
in
front
of
them
just
as
soon
as
the
hen
saw
me
she
fluttered
in
front
of
the
rabbit
and
spreading
out
her
wings
clucked
angrily
and
acted
as
if
she
would
peck
my
eyes
out
if
i
came
nearer
i
saw
that
they
were
harmless
creatures
and
remembering
my
adventure
with
the
snake
i
stepped
aside
besides
that
i
knew
by
their
smell
that
they
had
been
near
maxwell
so
perhaps
they
were
after
him
they
understood
quite
well
that
i
would
not
hurt
them
and
passed
by
me
the
rabbit
went
ahead
again
and
the
hen
fell
behind
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
hen
was
sleepy
and
did
like
to
be
out
so
late
at
night
and
was
only
following
the
rabbit
because
she
thought
it
was
her
duty
he
was
going
along
in
a
very
queer
fashion
putting
his
nose
to
the
ground
and
rising
up
on
his
hind
legs
and
sniffing
the
air
first
on
this
side
and
then
on
the
other
and
his
nose
going
going
all
the
time
he
smelled
all
around
the
house
till
he
came
to
maxwell
room
at
the
back
it
opened
on
the
veranda
by
a
glass
door
and
the
door
stood
ajar
the
rabbit
squeezed
himself
in
and
the
hen
stayed
out
she
watched
for
a
while
and
when
he
did
come
back
she
flew
upon
the
back
of
a
chair
that
stood
near
the
door
and
put
her
head
under
her
wing
i
went
back
to
my
bed
for
i
knew
they
would
do
no
harm
early
in
the
morning
when
i
was
walking
around
the
house
i
heard
a
great
shouting
and
laughing
from
maxwell
room
he
and
harry
had
just
discovered
the
hen
and
the
rabbit
and
harry
was
calling
his
mother
to
come
and
look
at
them
the
rabbit
had
slept
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
harry
was
chaffing
maxwell
very
much
and
was
telling
him
that
any
one
who
entertained
him
was
in
for
a
traveling
menagerie
they
had
a
great
deal
of
fun
over
it
and
maxwell
said
that
he
had
had
that
pretty
white
hen
as
a
pet
for
a
long
time
in
boston
once
when
she
ha
some
little
chickens
a
frightened
rabbit
that
was
being
chased
by
a
dog
ran
into
the
yard
in
his
terror
he
got
right
under
the
wings
and
she
sheltered
him
and
pecked
at
the
dog
eyes
and
kept
him
off
till
help
came
the
rabbit
belonged
to
a
neighbor
boy
and
maxwell
bought
it
from
him
from
the
day
the
hen
protected
him
she
became
his
friend
and
followed
him
everywhere
i
did
not
wonder
that
the
rabbit
wanted
to
see
his
master
there
was
something
about
that
young
man
that
made
dumb
animals
just
delight
in
him
when
wood
mentioned
this
to
him
he
said
i
do
know
why
they
should
i
do
do
anything
to
fascinate
them
you
love
them
she
said
and
they
know
it
that
is
the
reason
chapter
xxv
a
happy
horse
for
a
good
while
after
i
went
to
dingley
farm
i
was
very
shy
of
the
horses
for
i
was
afraid
they
might
kick
me
thinking
that
i
was
a
bad
dog
like
bruno
however
they
all
had
such
good
faces
and
looked
at
me
so
kindly
that
i
was
beginning
to
get
over
my
fear
of
them
fleetfoot
harry
colt
was
my
favorite
and
one
afternoon
when
harry
and
miss
laura
were
going
out
to
see
him
i
followed
them
fleetfoot
was
amusing
himself
by
rolling
over
and
over
on
the
grass
under
a
tree
but
when
he
saw
harry
he
gave
a
shrill
whinny
and
running
to
him
began
nosing
about
his
pockets
wait
a
bit
said
harry
holding
him
by
the
forelock
let
me
introduce
you
to
this
young
lady
miss
laura
morris
i
want
you
to
make
her
a
bow
he
gave
the
colt
some
sign
and
immediately
he
began
to
paw
the
ground
and
shake
his
head
harry
laughed
and
went
on
here
is
her
dog
joe
i
want
you
to
like
him
too
come
here
joe
i
was
not
at
all
afraid
for
i
knew
mr
harry
would
not
let
him
hurt
me
so
i
stood
in
front
of
him
and
for
the
first
time
had
a
good
look
at
him
they
called
him
the
colt
but
he
was
really
a
horse
and
had
already
been
put
to
work
he
was
of
a
dark
chestnut
color
and
had
a
body
and
a
long
handsome
head
and
i
never
saw
in
the
head
of
a
man
or
beast
a
more
beautiful
pair
of
eyes
than
that
colt
had
large
full
brown
eyes
they
were
that
he
turned
on
me
almost
as
a
person
would
he
looked
me
all
over
as
if
to
say
are
you
a
good
dog
and
will
you
treat
me
kindly
or
are
you
a
bad
one
like
bruno
and
will
you
chase
me
and
snap
at
my
heels
and
worry
me
so
that
i
shall
want
to
kick
you
i
looked
at
him
very
earnestly
and
wagged
my
body
and
lifted
myself
on
my
hind
legs
toward
him
he
seemed
pleased
and
put
down
his
nose
to
sniff
at
me
and
then
we
were
friends
friends
and
such
good
friends
for
next
to
jim
and
billy
i
have
loved
fleetfoot
harry
pulled
some
lumps
of
sugar
out
of
his
pocket
and
giving
them
to
miss
laura
told
her
to
put
them
on
the
palm
of
her
hand
and
hold
it
out
flat
toward
fleetfoot
the
colt
ate
the
sugar
and
all
the
time
eyed
her
with
his
quiet
observing
glance
that
made
her
exclaim
what
a
colt
he
is
like
an
old
horse
said
harry
when
he
hears
a
sudden
noise
he
stops
and
looks
all
about
him
to
find
an
explanation
he
has
been
well
trained
said
miss
laura
i
have
brought
him
up
carefully
said
harry
really
he
has
been
treated
more
like
a
dog
than
a
colt
he
follows
me
about
the
farm
and
smells
everything
i
handle
and
seems
to
want
to
know
the
reason
of
things
your
mother
says
replied
miss
laura
that
she
found
you
both
asleep
on
the
lawn
one
day
last
summer
and
the
colt
head
was
on
your
arm
harry
smiled
and
threw
his
arm
over
the
colt
neck
we
been
comrades
have
we
fleetfoot
i
been
almost
ashamed
of
his
devotion
he
has
followed
me
to
the
village
and
he
always
wants
to
go
fishing
with
me
he
four
years
old
now
so
he
ought
to
get
over
those
coltish
ways
i
driven
him
a
good
deal
we
going
out
in
the
buggy
this
afternoon
will
you
come
where
are
you
going
asked
miss
laura
just
for
a
short
drive
back
of
the
river
to
collect
some
money
for
father
i
be
home
long
before
tea
time
yes
i
should
like
to
go
said
miss
laura
i
will
go
to
the
house
and
get
my
other
hat
come
on
fleetfoot
said
harry
and
he
led
the
way
from
the
pasture
the
colt
following
behind
with
me
i
waited
about
the
veranda
and
in
a
short
time
harry
drove
up
to
the
front
door
the
buggy
was
black
and
shining
and
fleetfoot
had
on
a
harness
that
made
him
look
very
fine
he
stood
gently
switching
his
long
tail
to
keep
the
flies
away
and
with
his
head
turned
to
see
who
was
going
to
get
into
the
buggy
i
stood
by
him
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
miss
laura
and
harry
had
seated
themselves
he
acted
as
if
he
wanted
to
be
off
harry
spoke
to
him
and
away
he
went
i
racing
down
the
lane
by
his
side
so
happy
to
think
he
was
my
friend
he
liked
having
me
beside
him
and
every
few
seconds
put
down
his
head
toward
me
animals
can
tell
each
other
things
without
saying
a
word
when
fleetfoot
gave
his
head
a
little
toss
in
a
certain
way
i
knew
that
he
wanted
to
have
a
race
he
had
a
beautiful
even
gait
and
went
very
swiftly
harry
kept
speaking
to
him
to
check
him
you
do
like
him
to
go
too
fast
do
you
said
miss
laura
no
he
returned
i
think
we
could
make
a
racer
of
him
if
we
liked
but
father
and
i
do
go
in
for
fast
horses
there
is
too
much
said
about
fast
trotters
and
race
horses
on
some
of
the
farms
around
here
the
people
have
gone
mad
on
breeding
fast
horses
an
old
farmer
out
in
the
country
had
a
common
that
he
suddenly
found
out
had
great
powers
of
speed
and
endurance
he
sold
him
to
a
speculator
for
a
big
price
and
it
has
set
everybody
wild
if
the
people
who
give
all
their
time
to
it
ca
raise
fast
horses
i
do
see
how
the
farmers
can
a
fast
horse
on
a
farm
is
ruination
to
the
boys
for
it
starts
them
racing
and
betting
father
says
he
is
going
to
offer
a
prize
for
the
fastest
walker
that
can
be
bred
in
new
hampshire
that
dutchman
of
ours
heavy
as
he
is
is
a
fair
walker
and
cleve
and
pacer
can
each
walk
four
and
a
half
miles
an
hour
why
do
you
lay
such
stress
on
their
walking
fast
asked
miss
laura
because
so
much
of
the
farm
work
must
be
done
at
a
walk
ploughing
teaming
and
drawing
produce
to
market
and
going
up
and
down
hills
even
for
the
cities
it
is
good
to
have
fast
walkers
trotting
on
city
pavements
is
very
hard
on
the
dray
horses
if
they
are
allowed
to
go
at
a
quick
walk
their
legs
will
keep
strong
much
longer
it
is
shameful
the
way
horses
are
used
up
in
big
cities
our
pavements
are
so
bad
that
cab
horses
are
used
up
in
three
years
in
many
ways
we
are
a
great
deal
better
off
in
this
new
country
than
the
people
in
europe
but
we
are
not
in
respect
of
cab
horses
for
in
london
and
paris
they
last
for
five
years
i
have
seen
horses
drop
down
dead
in
new
york
just
from
hard
usage
poor
brutes
there
is
a
better
time
coming
for
them
though
when
electricity
is
more
fully
developed
we
see
some
wonderful
changes
as
it
is
last
year
in
different
places
about
thirty
thousand
horses
were
released
from
those
abominable
horse
cars
by
having
electricity
introduced
on
the
roads
well
fleetfoot
do
you
want
another
spin
all
right
my
boy
go
ahead
away
we
went
again
along
a
bit
of
level
road
fleetfoot
had
no
on
his
beautiful
neck
and
when
he
trotted
he
could
hold
his
head
in
an
easy
natural
position
with
his
wonderful
eyes
and
flowing
mane
and
tail
and
his
glossy
body
i
thought
that
he
was
the
handsomest
horse
i
had
ever
seen
he
loved
to
go
fast
and
when
harry
spoke
to
him
to
slow
up
again
he
tossed
his
head
with
impatience
but
he
was
too
to
disobey
in
all
the
years
that
i
have
known
fleetfoot
i
have
never
once
seen
him
refuse
to
do
as
his
master
told
him
you
have
forgotten
your
whip
have
you
harry
i
heard
miss
laura
say
as
we
jogged
slowly
along
and
i
ran
by
the
buggy
panting
and
with
my
tongue
hanging
out
i
never
use
one
said
harry
if
i
saw
any
man
lay
one
on
fleetfoot
i
knock
him
down
his
voice
was
so
severe
that
i
glanced
up
into
the
buggy
he
looked
just
as
he
did
the
day
that
he
stretched
jenkins
on
the
ground
and
gave
him
a
beating
i
am
so
glad
you
do
said
miss
laura
you
are
like
the
russians
many
of
them
control
their
horses
by
their
voices
and
call
them
such
pretty
names
but
you
have
to
use
a
whip
for
some
horses
do
you
cousin
harry
yes
laura
there
are
many
vicious
horses
that
ca
be
controlled
otherwise
and
then
with
many
horses
one
requires
a
whip
in
case
of
necessity
for
urging
them
forward
i
suppose
fleetfoot
never
balks
said
miss
laura
no
replied
harry
dutchman
sometimes
does
and
we
have
two
cures
for
him
both
equally
good
we
take
up
a
forefoot
and
strike
his
shoe
two
or
three
times
with
a
stone
the
operation
always
interests
him
greatly
and
he
usually
starts
if
he
does
go
for
that
we
pass
a
line
round
his
forelegs
at
the
knee
joint
then
go
in
front
of
him
and
draw
on
the
line
father
wo
let
the
men
use
a
whip
unless
they
are
driven
to
it
fleetfoot
has
had
a
happy
life
has
he
said
miss
laura
looking
admiringly
at
him
how
did
he
get
to
like
you
so
much
harry
i
broke
him
in
after
a
fashion
of
my
own
father
gave
him
to
me
and
the
first
time
i
saw
him
on
his
feet
i
went
up
carefully
and
put
my
hand
on
him
his
mother
was
rather
shy
of
me
for
we
had
had
her
long
and
it
made
him
shy
too
so
i
soon
left
him
the
next
time
i
stroked
him
the
next
time
i
put
my
arm
around
him
soon
he
acted
like
a
big
dog
i
could
lead
him
about
by
a
strap
and
i
made
a
little
halter
and
a
bridle
for
him
i
did
see
why
i
should
train
him
a
little
while
he
was
young
and
manageable
i
think
it
is
cruel
to
let
colts
run
till
one
has
to
employ
severity
in
mastering
them
of
course
i
did
not
let
him
do
much
work
colts
are
like
boys
a
boy
should
do
a
work
but
he
had
exercise
every
day
and
i
trained
him
to
draw
a
light
cart
behind
him
i
used
to
do
all
kinds
of
things
to
accustom
him
to
unusual
sounds
father
talked
a
good
deal
to
me
about
rarey
the
great
and
it
put
ideas
into
my
head
he
said
he
once
saw
rarey
come
on
a
stage
in
boston
with
a
timid
horse
that
he
was
going
to
accustom
to
a
loud
noise
first
a
bugle
was
blown
then
some
louder
instrument
and
so
on
till
there
was
a
whole
brass
band
going
rarey
reassured
the
animal
and
it
was
not
afraid
you
like
horses
better
than
any
other
animals
do
you
harry
asked
miss
laura
i
believe
i
do
though
i
am
very
fond
of
that
dog
of
yours
i
think
i
know
more
about
horses
than
dogs
have
you
noticed
scamp
very
much
oh
yes
i
often
watched
her
she
is
such
an
amusing
little
creature
she
the
most
interesting
one
we
got
that
is
after
fleetfoot
father
got
her
from
a
man
who
could
manage
her
and
she
came
to
us
with
a
legion
of
bad
tricks
father
has
taken
solid
comfort
though
in
breaking
her
of
them
she
is
his
pet
among
our
stock
i
suppose
you
know
that
horses
more
than
any
other
animals
are
creatures
of
habit
if
they
do
a
thing
once
they
will
do
it
again
when
she
came
to
us
she
had
a
trick
of
biting
at
a
person
who
gave
her
oats
she
would
do
it
without
fail
so
father
put
a
little
stick
under
his
arm
and
every
time
she
would
bite
he
would
give
her
a
rap
over
the
nose
she
soon
got
tired
of
biting
and
gave
it
up
sometimes
now
you
see
her
make
a
snap
at
father
as
if
she
was
going
to
bite
and
then
look
under
his
arm
to
see
if
the
stick
is
there
he
cured
some
of
her
tricks
in
one
way
and
some
in
another
one
bad
one
she
had
was
to
start
for
the
stable
the
minute
one
of
the
traces
was
unfastened
when
we
were
unharnessing
she
pulled
father
over
once
and
another
time
she
ran
the
shaft
of
the
sulky
clean
through
the
barn
door
the
next
time
father
brought
her
in
he
got
ready
for
her
he
twisted
the
lines
around
his
hands
and
the
minute
she
began
to
bolt
he
gave
a
tremendous
jerk
that
pulled
her
back
upon
her
haunches
and
shouted
it
cured
her
and
she
never
started
again
till
he
gave
her
the
word
often
now
you
see
her
throw
her
head
back
when
she
is
being
unhitched
he
only
did
it
once
yet
she
remembers
if
we
had
the
training
of
scamp
she
be
a
very
different
animal
it
nearly
all
in
the
bringing
up
of
a
colt
whether
it
will
turn
out
vicious
or
gentle
if
any
one
were
to
strike
fleetfoot
he
would
not
know
what
it
meant
he
has
been
brought
up
differently
from
scamp
she
was
probably
trained
by
some
brutal
man
who
inspired
her
with
distrust
of
the
human
species
she
never
bites
an
animal
and
seems
attached
to
all
the
other
horses
she
loves
fleetfoot
and
cleve
and
pacer
those
three
are
her
favorites
i
love
to
go
for
drives
with
cleve
and
pacer
said
miss
laura
they
are
so
steady
and
good
uncle
says
they
are
the
most
trusty
horses
he
has
he
has
told
me
about
the
man
you
had
who
said
that
those
two
horses
knew
more
than
most
that
was
old
davids
said
harry
when
we
had
him
he
was
courting
a
widow
who
lived
over
in
hoytville
about
once
a
fortnight
he
ask
father
for
one
of
the
horses
to
go
over
to
see
her
he
always
stayed
pretty
late
and
on
the
way
home
he
tie
the
reins
to
the
and
go
to
sleep
and
never
wake
up
till
cleve
or
pacer
whichever
one
he
happened
to
have
would
draw
up
in
the
barnyard
they
would
pass
any
rigs
they
happened
to
meet
and
turn
out
a
little
for
a
man
if
davids
was
asleep
he
could
always
tell
by
the
difference
in
their
gait
which
they
were
passing
they
go
quickly
past
a
man
and
much
slower
with
more
of
a
turn
out
if
it
was
a
team
but
i
dare
say
father
told
you
this
he
has
a
great
stock
of
horse
stories
and
i
am
almost
as
bad
you
will
have
to
cry
when
we
bore
you
you
never
do
replied
miss
laura
i
love
to
talk
about
animals
i
think
the
best
story
about
cleve
and
pacer
is
the
one
that
uncle
told
me
last
evening
i
do
think
you
were
there
it
was
about
stealing
the
oats
cleve
and
pacer
never
steal
said
harry
do
you
mean
scamp
she
the
thief
no
it
was
pacer
that
stole
he
got
out
of
his
box
uncle
says
and
found
two
bags
of
oats
and
he
took
one
in
his
teeth
and
dropped
it
before
cleve
and
ate
the
other
himself
and
uncle
was
so
amused
that
he
let
them
eat
a
long
time
and
stood
and
watched
them
that
a
clever
trick
said
harry
father
must
have
forgotten
to
tell
me
those
two
horses
have
been
mates
ever
since
i
can
remember
and
i
believe
if
they
were
separated
they
pine
away
and
die
you
have
noticed
how
low
the
partitions
are
between
the
boxes
in
the
horse
stable
father
says
you
would
put
a
lot
of
people
in
separate
boxes
in
a
room
where
they
could
see
each
other
and
horses
are
just
as
fond
of
company
as
we
are
cleve
and
pacer
are
always
nosing
each
other
a
horse
has
a
long
memory
father
has
had
horses
recognize
him
that
he
has
been
parted
from
for
twenty
years
speaking
of
their
memories
reminds
me
of
another
good
story
about
pacer
that
i
never
heard
till
yesterday
and
that
i
would
not
talk
about
to
any
one
but
you
and
mother
father
would
write
me
about
it
for
he
never
will
put
a
line
on
paper
where
any
one
reputation
is
concerned
chapter
xxvi
the
box
of
money
this
story
said
harry
is
about
one
of
the
hired
men
we
had
last
winter
whose
name
was
jacobs
he
was
a
cunning
fellow
with
a
hangdog
look
and
a
great
cleverness
at
stealing
farm
produce
from
father
on
the
sly
and
selling
it
father
knew
perfectly
well
what
he
was
doing
and
was
wondering
what
would
be
the
best
way
to
deal
with
him
when
one
day
something
happened
that
brought
matters
to
a
climax
father
had
to
go
to
sudbury
for
farming
tools
and
took
pacer
and
the
cutter
there
are
two
ways
of
going
there
one
the
sudbury
road
and
the
other
the
old
post
road
which
is
longer
and
seldom
used
on
this
occasion
father
took
the
post
road
the
snow
was
deep
and
he
wanted
to
inquire
after
an
old
man
who
had
been
robbed
and
half
frightened
to
death
a
few
days
before
he
was
a
miserable
old
creature
known
as
miser
jerrold
and
he
lived
alone
with
his
daughter
he
had
saved
a
little
money
that
he
kept
in
a
box
under
his
bed
when
father
got
near
the
place
he
was
astonished
to
see
by
pacer
actions
that
he
had
been
on
this
road
before
and
recently
too
father
is
so
sharp
about
horses
that
they
never
do
a
thing
that
he
does
attach
a
meaning
to
so
he
let
the
reins
hang
a
little
loose
and
kept
his
eye
on
pacer
the
horse
went
along
the
road
and
seeing
father
did
direct
him
turned
into
the
lane
leading
to
the
house
there
was
an
old
red
gate
at
the
end
of
it
and
he
stopped
in
front
of
it
and
waited
for
father
to
get
out
then
he
passed
through
and
instead
of
going
up
to
the
house
turned
around
and
stood
with
his
head
toward
the
road
father
never
said
a
word
but
he
was
doing
a
lot
of
thinking
he
went
into
the
house
and
found
the
old
man
sitting
over
the
fire
rubbing
his
hands
and
about
few
poor
dollars
that
he
said
he
had
had
stolen
from
him
father
had
never
seen
him
before
but
he
knew
he
had
the
name
of
being
half
silly
and
question
him
as
much
as
he
liked
he
could
make
nothing
of
him
the
daughter
said
that
they
had
gone
to
bed
at
dark
the
night
her
father
was
robbed
she
slept
up
stairs
and
he
down
below
about
ten
she
heard
him
scream
and
running
down
stairs
she
found
him
sitting
up
in
bed
and
the
window
wide
open
he
said
a
man
had
sprung
in
upon
him
stuffed
the
bedclothes
into
his
mouth
and
dragging
his
box
from
under
the
bed
had
made
off
with
it
she
ran
to
the
door
and
looked
out
but
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
it
was
dark
and
snowing
a
little
so
no
traces
of
footsteps
were
to
be
perceived
in
the
morning
father
found
that
the
neighbors
were
dropping
in
to
bear
the
old
man
company
so
he
drove
on
to
sudbury
and
then
returned
home
when
he
got
back
he
said
jacobs
was
hanging
about
the
stable
in
a
nervous
kind
of
a
way
and
said
he
wanted
to
speak
to
him
father
said
very
good
but
put
the
horse
in
first
jacobs
unhitched
and
father
sat
on
one
of
the
stable
benches
and
watched
him
till
he
came
lounging
along
with
a
straw
in
his
mouth
and
said
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
west
and
he
like
to
set
off
at
once
father
said
again
very
good
but
first
he
had
a
little
account
to
settle
with
him
and
he
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
paper
where
he
had
jotted
down
as
far
as
he
could
every
quart
of
oats
and
every
bag
of
grain
and
every
quarter
of
a
dollar
of
market
money
that
jacobs
had
defrauded
him
of
father
said
the
fellow
turned
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
for
he
thought
he
had
covered
up
his
tracks
so
cleverly
that
he
would
never
be
found
out
then
father
said
down
jacobs
for
i
have
got
to
have
a
long
talk
with
you
he
had
him
there
about
an
hour
and
when
he
finished
the
fellow
was
completely
broken
down
father
told
him
that
there
were
just
two
courses
in
life
for
a
young
man
to
take
and
he
had
gotten
on
the
wrong
one
he
was
a
young
smart
fellow
and
if
he
turned
right
around
now
there
was
a
chance
for
him
if
he
there
was
nothing
but
the
state
prison
ahead
of
him
for
he
think
he
was
going
to
gull
and
cheat
all
the
world
and
never
be
found
out
father
said
he
give
him
all
the
help
in
his
power
if
he
had
his
word
that
he
try
to
be
an
honest
man
then
he
tore
up
the
paper
and
said
there
was
an
end
of
his
indebtedness
to
him
jacobs
is
only
a
young
fellow
or
thereabout
and
father
says
he
sobbed
like
a
baby
then
without
looking
at
him
father
gave
an
account
of
his
afternoon
drive
just
as
if
he
was
talking
to
himself
he
said
that
pacer
never
to
his
knowledge
had
been
on
that
road
before
and
yet
he
seemed
perfectly
familiar
with
it
and
that
he
stopped
and
turned
already
to
leave
again
quickly
instead
of
going
up
to
the
door
and
how
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
started
on
a
run
down
the
lane
the
minute
father
foot
was
in
the
cutter
again
in
the
course
of
his
remarks
father
mentioned
the
fact
that
on
monday
the
evening
that
the
robbery
was
committed
jacobs
had
borrowed
pacer
to
go
to
the
junction
but
had
come
in
with
the
horse
steaming
and
looking
as
if
he
had
been
driven
a
much
longer
distance
than
that
father
said
that
when
he
got
done
jacobs
had
sunk
down
all
in
a
heap
on
the
stable
floor
with
his
hands
over
his
face
father
left
him
to
have
it
out
with
himself
and
went
to
the
house
the
next
morning
jacobs
looked
just
the
same
as
usual
and
went
about
with
the
other
men
doing
his
work
but
saying
nothing
about
going
west
late
in
the
afternoon
a
farmer
going
by
hailed
father
and
asked
if
he
heard
the
news
old
miser
jerrold
box
had
been
left
on
his
doorstep
some
time
through
the
night
and
he
found
it
in
the
morning
the
money
was
all
there
but
the
old
fellow
was
so
cute
that
he
would
tell
any
one
how
much
it
was
the
neighbors
had
persuaded
him
to
bank
it
and
he
was
coming
to
town
the
next
morning
with
it
and
that
night
some
of
them
were
going
to
help
him
mount
guard
over
it
father
told
the
men
at
milking
time
and
he
said
jacobs
looked
as
unconscious
as
possible
however
from
that
day
there
was
a
change
in
him
he
never
told
father
in
so
many
words
that
he
d
resolved
to
be
an
honest
man
but
his
actions
spoke
for
him
he
had
been
a
kind
of
sullen
unwilling
fellow
but
now
he
turned
handy
and
obliging
and
it
was
a
real
trial
to
father
to
part
with
him
miss
laura
was
intensely
interested
in
this
story
where
is
he
now
cousin
harry
she
asked
eagerly
what
became
of
him
harry
laughed
in
such
amusement
that
i
stared
up
at
him
and
even
fleetfoot
turned
his
head
around
to
see
what
the
joke
was
we
were
going
very
slowly
up
a
long
steep
hill
and
in
the
clear
still
air
we
could
hear
every
word
spoken
in
the
buggy
the
last
part
of
the
story
is
the
best
to
my
mind
said
harry
and
as
romantic
as
even
a
girl
could
desire
the
affair
of
the
stolen
box
was
much
talked
about
along
sudbury
way
and
miss
jerrold
got
to
be
considered
quite
a
desirable
young
person
among
some
of
the
youth
near
there
though
she
is
a
creature
and
not
as
neat
in
her
personal
attire
as
a
young
girl
should
be
among
her
suitors
was
jacobs
he
cut
out
a
blacksmith
and
a
painter
and
several
young
farmers
and
father
said
he
never
in
his
life
had
such
a
time
to
keep
a
straight
face
as
when
jacobs
came
to
him
this
spring
and
said
he
was
going
to
marry
old
miser
jerrold
daughter
he
wanted
to
quit
father
employ
and
he
thanked
him
in
a
real
manly
way
for
the
manner
in
which
he
had
always
treated
him
well
jacobs
left
and
mother
says
that
father
would
sit
and
speculate
about
him
as
to
whether
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
eliza
jerrold
or
whether
he
was
determined
to
regain
possession
of
the
box
and
was
going
to
do
it
honestly
or
whether
he
was
sorry
for
having
frightened
the
old
man
into
a
greater
degree
of
imbecility
and
was
marrying
the
girl
so
that
he
could
take
care
of
him
or
whether
it
was
something
else
and
so
on
and
so
on
he
had
a
dozen
theories
and
then
mother
says
he
would
burst
out
laughing
and
say
it
was
one
of
the
cutest
tricks
that
he
had
ever
heard
of
in
the
end
jacobs
got
married
and
father
and
mother
went
to
the
wedding
father
gave
the
bridegroom
a
yoke
of
oxen
and
mother
gave
the
bride
a
lot
of
household
linen
and
i
believe
they
as
happy
as
the
day
is
long
jacobs
makes
his
wife
comb
her
hair
and
he
waits
on
the
old
man
as
if
he
was
his
son
and
he
is
improving
the
farm
that
was
going
to
rack
and
ruin
and
i
hear
he
is
going
to
build
a
new
house
harry
exclaimed
miss
laura
ca
you
take
me
to
see
them
yes
indeed
mother
often
drives
over
to
take
them
little
things
and
we
go
too
sometime
i
like
to
see
jacobs
myself
now
that
he
is
a
decent
fellow
strange
to
say
though
he
had
the
best
of
character
no
one
has
ever
suspected
him
of
the
robbery
and
he
been
cunning
enough
never
to
say
a
word
about
it
father
says
jacobs
is
like
all
the
rest
of
us
there
mixture
of
good
and
evil
in
him
and
sometimes
one
predominates
and
sometimes
the
other
but
we
must
get
on
and
not
talk
here
all
day
get
up
fleetfoot
where
did
you
say
we
were
going
asked
miss
laura
as
we
crossed
the
bridge
over
the
river
a
little
way
back
here
in
the
woods
he
replied
there
an
englishman
on
a
small
clearing
that
he
calls
penhollow
father
loaned
him
some
money
three
years
ago
and
he
wo
pay
either
interest
or
principal
i
think
i
heard
of
him
said
miss
laura
is
he
the
man
whom
the
boys
call
lord
chesterfield
the
same
one
he
a
queer
specimen
of
a
man
father
has
always
stood
up
for
him
he
has
a
great
liking
for
the
english
he
says
we
ought
to
be
as
ready
to
help
an
englishman
as
an
american
for
we
spring
from
common
stock
oh
not
englishmen
only
said
miss
laura
warmly
chinamen
and
negroes
and
everybody
there
ought
to
be
a
brotherhood
of
nations
harry
yes
miss
enthusiasm
i
suppose
there
ought
to
be
and
looking
up
i
could
see
that
harry
was
gazing
admiringly
into
his
cousin
face
please
tell
me
some
more
about
the
englishman
said
miss
laura
there
is
much
to
tell
he
lives
alone
only
coming
occasionally
to
the
village
for
supplies
and
though
he
is
poorer
than
poverty
he
despises
every
soul
within
a
radius
of
him
and
looks
upon
us
as
no
better
than
an
order
of
thrifty
lower
animals
why
is
that
asked
miss
laura
in
surprise
he
is
a
gentleman
laura
and
we
are
only
common
people
my
father
ca
hand
a
lady
in
and
out
of
a
carriage
as
lord
chesterfield
can
nor
can
he
make
so
grand
a
bow
nor
does
he
put
on
evening
dress
for
a
late
dinner
and
we
never
go
to
the
opera
nor
to
the
theatre
and
know
nothing
of
polite
society
nor
can
we
tell
exactly
whom
our
sprang
from
i
tell
you
there
is
a
gulf
between
us
and
that
englishman
wider
than
the
one
young
curtius
leaped
into
miss
laura
was
laughing
merrily
how
funny
that
sounds
harry
so
he
despises
you
and
she
glanced
at
her
cousin
and
his
handsome
buggy
and
horse
and
then
burst
into
another
merry
peal
of
laughter
harry
laughed
too
it
does
seem
absurd
sometimes
when
i
pass
him
jogging
along
to
town
in
his
rickety
old
cart
and
look
at
his
pale
cruel
face
and
know
that
he
is
a
gambler
and
man
of
the
world
and
yet
considers
himself
infinitely
superior
to
me
a
young
man
in
the
prime
of
life
with
a
good
constitution
and
happy
prospects
it
makes
me
turn
away
to
hide
a
smile
by
this
time
we
had
left
the
river
and
the
meadows
far
behind
us
and
were
passing
through
a
thick
wood
the
road
was
narrow
and
very
broken
and
fleetfoot
was
obliged
to
pick
his
way
carefully
why
does
the
englishman
live
in
this
place
if
he
is
so
fond
of
city
life
said
miss
laura
i
do
know
said
harry
father
is
afraid
that
he
has
committed
some
misdeed
and
is
in
hiding
but
we
say
nothing
about
it
we
have
not
seen
him
for
some
weeks
and
to
tell
the
truth
this
trip
is
as
much
to
see
what
has
become
of
him
as
to
make
a
demand
upon
him
for
the
money
as
he
lives
alone
he
might
lie
there
ill
and
no
one
would
know
anything
about
it
the
last
time
that
we
knew
of
his
coming
to
the
village
was
to
draw
quite
a
sum
of
money
from
the
bank
it
annoyed
father
for
he
said
he
might
take
some
of
it
to
pay
his
debts
i
think
his
relatives
in
england
supply
him
with
funds
here
we
are
at
the
entrance
to
the
mansion
of
penhollow
i
must
get
out
and
open
the
gate
that
will
admit
us
to
the
winding
avenue
we
had
arrived
in
front
of
some
bars
which
were
laid
across
an
opening
in
the
snake
fence
that
ran
along
one
side
of
the
road
i
sat
down
and
looked
about
it
was
a
strange
lonely
place
the
trees
almost
met
overhead
and
it
was
very
dim
and
quiet
the
sun
could
only
send
little
straggling
beams
through
the
branches
there
was
a
muddy
pool
of
water
before
the
bars
that
harry
was
letting
down
and
he
got
his
feet
wet
in
it
confound
that
englishman
he
said
backing
out
of
the
water
and
wiping
his
boots
on
the
grass
he
has
even
gumption
enough
to
throw
down
a
load
of
stone
there
drive
in
laura
and
i
put
up
the
bars
fleetfoot
took
us
through
the
opening
and
then
harry
jumped
into
the
buggy
and
took
up
the
reins
again
we
had
to
go
very
slowly
up
a
narrow
rough
road
the
bushes
scratched
and
scraped
against
the
buggy
and
harry
looked
very
much
annoyed
no
man
liveth
to
himself
said
miss
laura
softly
this
carelessness
is
giving
you
trouble
why
does
he
cut
these
branches
that
overhang
the
road
he
ca
do
it
because
his
abominable
laziness
wo
let
him
said
harry
i
like
to
be
behind
him
for
a
week
and
i
make
him
step
a
little
faster
we
have
arrived
at
last
thank
goodness
there
was
a
small
grass
clearing
in
the
midst
of
the
woods
chips
and
bits
of
wood
were
littered
about
and
across
the
clearing
was
a
house
of
unpainted
boards
the
front
door
was
propped
open
by
a
stick
some
of
the
panes
of
glass
in
the
windows
were
broken
and
the
whole
house
had
a
melancholy
dilapidated
look
i
thought
that
i
had
never
seen
such
a
place
it
seems
as
if
there
was
no
one
about
said
harry
with
a
puzzled
face
barron
must
be
away
will
you
hold
fleetfoot
laura
while
i
go
and
see
he
drew
the
buggy
up
near
a
small
log
building
that
had
evidently
been
used
for
a
stable
and
i
lay
down
beside
it
and
watched
miss
laura
chapter
xxvii
a
neglected
stable
i
had
not
been
on
the
ground
more
than
a
few
seconds
before
i
turned
my
eyes
from
miss
laura
to
the
log
hut
it
was
deathly
quiet
there
was
not
a
sound
coming
from
it
but
the
air
was
full
of
queer
smells
and
i
was
so
uneasy
that
i
could
not
lie
still
there
was
something
the
matter
with
fleetfoot
too
he
was
pawing
the
ground
and
whinnying
and
looking
not
after
harry
but
toward
the
log
building
joe
said
miss
laura
what
is
the
matter
with
you
and
fleetfoot
why
do
you
stand
still
is
there
any
stranger
about
and
she
peered
out
of
the
buggy
i
knew
there
was
something
wrong
somewhere
but
i
did
know
what
it
was
so
i
stretched
myself
up
on
the
step
of
the
buggy
and
licked
her
hand
and
barking
to
ask
her
to
excuse
me
i
ran
off
to
the
other
side
of
the
log
hut
there
was
a
door
there
but
it
was
closed
and
propped
firmly
up
by
a
plank
that
i
could
not
move
scratch
as
hard
as
i
liked
i
was
determined
to
get
in
so
i
jumped
against
the
door
and
tore
and
bit
at
the
plank
till
miss
laura
came
to
help
me
you
wo
find
anything
but
rats
in
that
ramshackle
old
place
beautiful
joe
she
said
as
she
pulled
the
plank
away
and
as
you
do
hurt
them
i
do
see
what
you
want
to
get
in
for
however
you
are
a
sensible
dog
and
usually
have
a
reason
for
having
your
own
way
so
i
am
going
to
let
you
have
it
the
plank
fell
down
as
she
spoke
and
she
pulled
open
the
rough
door
and
looked
in
there
was
no
window
inside
only
the
light
that
streamed
through
the
door
so
that
for
an
instant
she
could
see
nothing
is
any
one
here
she
asked
in
her
clear
sweet
voice
there
was
no
answer
except
a
low
moaning
sound
why
some
poor
creature
is
in
trouble
joe
said
miss
laura
cheerfully
let
us
see
what
it
is
and
she
stepped
inside
i
shall
never
forget
seeing
my
dear
miss
laura
going
into
that
wet
and
filthy
log
house
holding
up
her
white
dress
in
her
hands
her
face
a
picture
of
pain
and
horror
there
were
two
rough
stalls
in
it
and
in
the
first
one
was
tied
a
cow
with
a
calf
lying
beside
her
i
could
never
have
believed
if
i
had
not
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
that
an
animal
could
get
so
thin
as
that
cow
was
her
backbone
rose
up
high
and
sharp
her
hip
bones
stuck
away
out
and
all
her
body
seemed
shrunken
in
there
were
sores
on
her
sides
and
the
smell
from
her
stall
was
terrible
miss
laura
gave
one
cry
of
pity
then
with
a
very
pale
face
she
dropped
her
dress
and
seizing
a
little
penknife
from
her
pocket
she
hacked
at
the
rope
that
tied
the
cow
to
the
manger
and
cut
it
so
that
the
cow
could
lie
down
the
first
thing
the
poor
cow
did
was
to
lick
her
calf
but
it
was
quite
dead
i
used
to
think
jenkins
cows
were
thin
enough
but
he
never
had
one
that
looked
like
this
her
head
was
like
the
head
of
a
skeleton
and
her
eyes
had
such
a
famished
look
that
i
turned
away
sick
at
heart
to
think
that
she
had
suffered
so
when
the
cow
lay
down
the
moaning
noise
stopped
for
she
had
been
making
it
miss
laura
ran
outdoors
snatched
a
handful
of
grass
and
took
it
in
to
her
the
cow
ate
it
gratefully
but
slowly
for
her
strength
seemed
all
gone
miss
laura
then
went
into
the
other
stall
to
see
if
there
was
any
creature
there
there
had
been
a
horse
there
was
now
a
lean
animal
lying
on
the
ground
that
seemed
as
if
he
was
dead
there
was
a
heavy
rope
knotted
round
his
neck
and
fastened
to
his
empty
rack
miss
laura
stepped
carefully
between
his
feet
cut
the
rope
and
going
outside
the
stall
spoke
kindly
to
him
he
moved
his
ears
slightly
raised
his
head
tried
to
get
up
fell
back
again
tried
again
and
succeeded
in
staggering
outdoors
after
miss
laura
who
kept
encouraging
him
and
then
he
fell
down
on
the
grass
fleetfoot
stared
at
the
creature
as
if
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
the
horse
had
no
sores
on
his
body
as
the
cow
had
nor
was
he
quite
so
lean
but
he
was
the
weakest
most
animal
that
i
ever
saw
the
flies
settled
on
him
and
miss
laura
had
to
keep
driving
them
away
he
was
a
white
horse
with
some
kind
of
eyes
and
whenever
he
turned
them
on
miss
laura
she
would
look
away
she
did
not
cry
as
she
often
did
over
the
sick
and
suffering
animals
this
seemed
too
bad
for
tears
she
just
hovered
over
that
poor
horse
with
her
face
as
white
as
her
dress
and
an
expression
of
fright
in
her
eyes
oh
how
dirty
he
was
i
would
never
have
imagined
that
a
horse
could
get
in
such
a
condition
all
this
had
only
taken
a
few
minutes
and
just
after
she
got
the
horse
out
harry
appeared
he
came
out
of
the
house
with
a
slow
step
that
quickened
to
a
run
when
he
saw
miss
laura
laura
he
exclaimed
what
are
you
doing
then
he
stopped
and
looked
at
the
horse
not
in
amazement
but
very
sorrowfully
barron
is
gone
he
said
and
crumpling
up
a
piece
of
paper
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
what
is
to
be
done
for
these
animals
there
is
a
cow
is
there
he
stepped
to
the
door
of
the
log
hut
glanced
in
and
said
quickly
do
you
feel
able
to
drive
home
yes
said
miss
laura
sure
and
he
eyed
her
anxiously
yes
yes
she
returned
what
shall
i
get
just
tell
father
that
barron
has
run
away
and
left
a
starving
pig
cow
and
horse
there
not
a
thing
to
eat
here
he
know
what
to
do
drive
you
to
the
road
miss
laura
got
into
the
buggy
and
harry
jumped
in
after
her
he
drove
her
to
the
road
and
put
down
the
bars
then
he
said
go
straight
on
you
soon
be
on
the
open
road
and
there
nothing
to
harm
you
joe
will
look
after
you
meanwhile
i
go
back
to
the
house
and
heat
some
water
miss
laura
let
fleetfoot
go
as
fast
as
he
liked
on
the
way
home
and
it
only
seemed
a
few
minutes
before
we
drove
into
the
yard
adele
came
out
to
meet
us
where
uncle
asked

laura

of
those
tin
kettles
with
covers
for
a
few
minutes
miss
laura
and
adele
flew
about
the
kitchen
then
we
set
off
again
miss
laura
took
me
in
the
buggy
for
i
was
out
of
breath
and
wheezing
greatly
i
had
to
sit
on
the
seat
beside
her
for
the
bottom
of
the
buggy
and
the
back
were
full
of
eatables
for
the
poor
sick
animals
just
as
we
drove
into
the
road
we
met
wood
are
you
running
away
with
the
farm
he
said
with
a
laugh
pointing
to
the
carrot
tops
that
were
gaily
waving
over
the
dashboard
miss
laura
said
a
few
words
to
him
and
with
a
very
grave
face
he
got
in
beside
her
in
a
short
time
we
were
back
on
the
lonely
road
harry
was
waiting
at
the
gate
for
us
and
when
he
saw
miss
laura
he
said
why
did
you
come
jack
again
you
be
tired
out
this
is
a
place
for
a
sensitive
girl
like
you
i
thought

she
gently
so
you
can
said
wood

go
into
the
house
and
sit

and
harry

i
will
come
to
you

have
you
been
doing
harry
i
watered
them
a
little
and
got
a
good
fire
going
i
scarcely
think
the

think
we

the
horse
i
tried
to
get
the
cow
but
she
ca
move

her
alone
said
wood
give
her
some
food
and
her
strength
will

to
her
what
have
you
got

and
he
began
to
take
the
things
out
of
the
buggy
bless
the
child
she
thought
of
everything
even
the
salt
bring
those
things
into
the
house
harry
and
we
make
a
bran
mash
for
more
than
an
hour
they
were
fussing
over
the
animals
then
they
came
in
and
sat
down
the
inside
of
the
englishman
house
was
as
untidy
as
the
outside
there
was
no
upstairs
to
it

sitting
in
a
few
hanging
shelves
with
some
dishes
and
books
on
them
and
two
or
three
small
boxes
that
had
evidently
been
used
for
seats
on
the
walls
were
tacked
some
pictures
of
grand
houses
and
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
fine
clothes
and
miss

said
that
some
of
them
were
noble

i
glad
this
particular
nobleman
has
left

esq
dear
sir
it
is
a
matter
of
great
regret
to
me
that
i
am
suddenly
called
away
from
my
place
at
penhollow
and
will
therefore
not
be
able
to
do
myself
the
pleasure
of
calling
on
you
and
settling
my
little
account
i
sincerely
hope
that
the
possession
of
my
live
stock
which
i
make
entirely
over
to
you
will
more
than
reimburse
you
for
any
trifling
expense
which
you
may
have
incurred
on
my
account
if
it
is
any
gratification
to
you
to
know
that
you
have
rendered
a
slight
assistance
to
the
son
of
one
of
england
noblest
noblemen
you
have
it
with
expressions
of
the
deepest
respect
and
hoping
that
my
stock
may
be
in
good
condition

take
possession

dropped
the
paper
uncle
did
he
leave
those
animals
to
starve
did
you
notice
said
wood
grimly
that
there
was
a
wisp
of
hay
inside
that
shanty
and
that
where
the
poor
beasts
were
tied
up
the
wood
was
knawed
and
bitten
by
them
in
their
torture
for
food
he
have
sent
me
that
note
instead
of
leaving
it
here
on
the
table
if
he
wanted
me
to
know
the
note
is
dated
but
i
judge
he
been
gone
five
or
six
days
he
has
had
a
spite
against
me
ever
since
i
lent
him
that
hundred
dollars
i
do
know
why
for
i
stood
up
for
him
when
others
would
have
run
him
out
of
the
place
he
intended
me
to
come
here
and
find
every
animal
lying
dead
he
even
had
a
rope
around
the
pig
neck
harry
my
boy
let
us
go
and
look
after
them
again
i
love
a
dumb
brute
too
well
to
let
it
suffer
but
in
this
case
i
give
two
hundred
dollars
more
if
i
could
make
them
live
and
have
barron
know
it
they
left
the
room
and
miss
laura
sat
turning
the
sheet
of
paper
over
and
over
with
a
kind
of
horror
in
her
face
it
was
a
very
dirty
piece
of
paper
but
she
made
a
discovery
she
took
it
in
her
hand
and
went
i
am
sure
that
the
poor
horse
lying
on
the
grass
knew
her
he
lifted
his
head
and
what
a
different
expression
he
had
now
that
his
hunger
had
been
partly
satisfied
miss
laura
stroked
and
patted
him
then
she
called
to
her
cousin
harry
will
you
look
at
this
he
took
the
paper
from
her
and
said
that
is
a
crest
shining
through
the
different
strata
of
dust
and
grime
probably
that
of
his
own
family
we
have
it
cleaned
and
it
will
enable
us
to
track
the
villain
you
want
him
punished
do
you
he
said
with
a
little
sly
laugh
at
miss
laura
she
made
a
gesture
in
the
direction
of
the
suffering
horse
and
said
frankly
yes
i
do
well
my
dear
girl
he
said
father
and
i
are
with
you
if
we
can
hunt
barron
down
we
do
it
then
he
muttered
to
himself
as
she
turned
away
she
is
a
real
puritan
gentle
and
sweet
and
good
and
yet
severe
rewards
for
the
virtuous
punishments
for
the
vicious
and
he
repeated
some
poetry
she
was
so
charitable
and
so
piteous
she
would
weep
if
that
she
saw
a
mouse
caught
in
a
trap
if
it
were
dead
or
bled
miss
laura
saw
that
wood
and
harry
were
doing
all
that
could
be
done
for
the
cow
and
horse
so
she
wandered
down
to
a
hollow
at
the
back
of
the
house
where
the
englishman
had
kept
his
pig
just
now
he
looked
more
like
a
greyhound
than
a
pig
his
legs
were
so
long
his
nose
so
sharp
and
hunger
instead
of
making
him
stupid
like
the
horse
and
cow
had
made
him
more
lively
i
think
he
had
probably
not
suffered
so
much
as
they
had
or
perhaps
he
had
had
a
greater
store
of
fat
to
nourish
him
harry
said
that
if
he
had
been
a
girl
he
would
have
laughed
and
cried
at
the
same
time
when
he
discovered
that
pig
he
must
have
been
asleep
or
exhausted
when
we
arrived
for
there
was
not
a
sound
out
of
him
but
shortly
afterward
he
had
set
up
a
yelling
that
attracted
harry
attention
and
made
him
run
down
to
him
harry
said
he
was
raging
around
his
pen
digging
the
ground
with
his
snout
falling
down
and
getting
up
again
and
by
a
miracle
escaping
death
by
choking
from
the
rope
that
was
tied
around
his
neck
now
that
his
hunger
had
been
satisfied
he
was
gazing
contentedly
at
his
little
trough
that
was
half
full
of
good
sweet
milk
harry
said
that
a
starving
animal
like
a
starving
person
should
only
be
fed
a
little
at
a
time
but
the
englishman
animals
had
always
been
fed
poorly
and
their
stomachs
had
contracted
so
that
they
could
not
eat
much
at
one
time
miss
laura
got
a
stick
and
scratched
poor
piggy
back
a
little
and
then
she
went
back
to
the
house
in
a
short
time
we
went
home
with
wood
harry
was
going
to
stay
all
night
with
the
sick
animals
and
his
mother
would
send
him
things
to
make
him
comfortable
she
was
better
by
the
time
we
got
home
and
was
horrified
to
hear
the
tale
of
barron
neglect
later
in
the
evening
she
sent
one
of
the
men
over
with
a
whole
box
full
of
things
for
her
darling
boy
and
a
nice
hot
tea
done
up
for
him
in
a
covered
dish
when
the
man
came
home
he
said
that
harry
would
not
sleep
in
the
englishman
dirty
house
but
had
slung
a
hammock
out
under
the
trees
however
he
would
not
be
able
to
sleep
much
for
he
had
his
lantern
by
his
side
all
ready
to
jump
up
and
attend
to
the
horse
and
cow
it
was
a
very
lonely
place
for
him
out
there
in
the
woods
and
his
mother
said
that
she
would
be
glad
when
the
sick
animals
could
be
driven
to
their
own
farm
chapter
xxviii
the
end
of
the
englishman
in
a
few
days
thanks
to
harry
constant
care
the
horse
and
cow
were
able
to
walk
it
was
a
mournful
procession
that
came
into
the
yard
at
dingley
farm
the
horse
and
lean
cow
and
funny
little
thin
pig
staggering
along
in
such
a
shaky
fashion
their
hoofs
were
diseased
and
had
partly
rotted
away
so
that
they
could
not
walk
straight
though
it
was
only
a
mile
or
two
from
penhollow
to
dingley
farm
they
were
tired
out
and
dropped
down
exhausted
on
their
comfortable
beds
miss
laura
was
so
delighted
to
think
that
they
had
all
lived
that
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
her
eyes
were
bright
and
shining
and
she
went
from
one
to
another
with
such
a
happy
face
the
queer
little
pig
that
harry
had
christened
daddy
longlegs
had
been
washed
and
he
lay
on
his
heap
of
straw
in
the
corner
of
his
neat
little
pen
and
surveyed
his
clean
trough
and
abundance
of
food
with
the
air
of
a
prince
why
he
would
be
clean
and
dry
here
and
all
his
life
he
had
been
used
to
dirty
damp
penhollow
with
the
trees
hanging
over
him
and
his
little
feet
in
a
mass
of
filth
and
dead
leaves
happy
little
pig
his
ugly
eyes
seemed
to
blink
and
gleam
with
gratitude
and
he
knew
miss
laura
and
harry
as
well
as
i
did
his
tiny
tail
was
curled
so
tight
that
it
was
almost
in
a
knot
wood
said
that
was
a
sign
that
he
was
healthy
and
happy
and
that
when
poor
daddy
was
at
penhollow
he
had
noticed
that
his
tail
hung
as
limp
and
as
loose
as
the
tail
of
a
rat
he
came
and
leaned
over
the
pen
with
miss
laura
and
had
a
little
talk
with
her
about
pigs
he
said
they
were
by
no
means
the
stupid
animals
that
some
people
considered
them
he
had
had
pigs
that
were
as
clever
as
dogs
one
little
black
pig
that
he
had
once
sold
to
a
man
away
back
in
the
country
had
found
his
way
home
through
the
woods
across
the
river
up
hill
and
down
dale
and
he
been
taken
to
the
place
with
a
bag
over
his
head
wood
said
that
he
kept
that
pig
because
he
knew
so
much
he
said
the
most
knowing
pigs
he
ever
saw
were
canadian
pigs
one
time
he
was
having
a
trip
on
a
sailing
vessel
and
it
anchored
in
a
long
narrow
harbor
in
canada
where
the
tide
came
in
with
a
front
four
or
five
feet
high
called
the
bore
there
was
a
village
opposite
the
place
where
the
ship
was
anchored
and
every
day
at
low
tide
a
number
of
pigs
came
down
to
look
for
sometimes
they
went
out
for
half
a
mile
over
the
mud
flats
but
always
a
few
minutes
before
the
tide
came
rushing
in
they
turned
and
hurried
to
the
shore
their
instincts
warned
them
that
if
they
stayed
any
longer
they
would
be
drowned
wood
had
a
number
of
pigs
and
after
a
while
daddy
was
put
in
with
them
and
a
fine
time
he
had
of
it
making
friends
with
the
other
little
grunters
they
were
often
let
out
in
the
pasture
or
orchard
and
when
they
were
there
i
could
always
single
out
daddy
from
among
them
because
he
was
the
smartest
though
he
had
been
brought
up
in
such
a
miserable
way
he
soon
learned
to
take
very
good
care
of
himself
at
dingley
farm
and
it
was
amusing
to
see
him
when
a
storm
was
coming
on
running
about
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
carrying
little
bundles
of
straw
in
his
mouth
to
make
himself
a
bed
he
was
a
white
pig
and
was
always
kept
very
clean
wood
said
that
it
is
wrong
to
keep
pigs
dirty
they
like
to
be
clean
as
well
as
other
animals
and
if
they
were
kept
so
human
beings
would
not
get
so
many
diseases
from
eating
their
flesh
the
cow
poor
unhappy
creature
never
as
long
as
she
lived
on
dingley
farm
lost
a
strange
melancholy
look
from
her
eyes
i
have
heard
it
said
that
animals
forget
past
unhappiness
and
perhaps
some
of
them
do
i
know
that
i
have
never
forgotten
my
one
miserable
year
with
jenkins
and
i
have
been
a
sober
thoughtful
dog
in
consequence
of
it
and
not
playful
like
some
dogs
who
have
never
known
what
it
is
to
be
really
unhappy
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
the
englishman
cow
was
thinking
of
her
poor
dead
calf
starved
to
death
by
her
cruel
master
she
got
well
herself
and
came
and
went
with
the
other
cows
seemingly
as
happy
as
they
but
often
when
i
watched
her
standing
chewing
her
cud
and
looking
away
in
the
distance
i
could
see
a
difference
between
her
face
and
the
faces
of
the
cows
that
had
always
been
happy
on
dingley
farm
even
the
farm
hands
called
her
old
melancholy
and
soon
she
got
to
be
known
by
that
name
or
mel
for
short
until
she
got
well
she
was
put
into
the
cow
stable
where
wood
cows
all
stood
at
night
upon
raised
platforms
of
earth
covered
over
with
straw
litter
and
she
was
tied
with
a
dutch
halter
so
that
she
could
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
when
she
wanted
to
when
she
got
well
she
was
put
out
to
pasture
with
the
other
cows
the
horse
they
named
scrub
because
he
could
never
be
under
any
circumstance
anything
but
a
animal
he
was
put
into
the
horse
stable
in
a
stall
next
fleetfoot
and
as
the
partition
was
low
they
could
look
over
at
each
other
in
time
by
dint
of
much
doctoring
scrub
hoofs
became
clean
and
sound
and
he
was
able
to
do
some
work
miss
laura
petted
him
a
great
deal
she
often
took
out
apples
to
the
stable
and
fleetfoot
would
throw
up
his
beautiful
head
and
look
reproachfully
over
the
partition
at
her
for
she
always
stayed
longer
with
scrub
than
with
him
and
scrub
always
got
the
larger
share
of
whatever
good
thing
was
going
poor
old
scrub
i
think
he
loved
miss
laura
he
was
a
stupid
sort
of
a
horse
and
always
acted
as
if
he
was
blind
he
would
run
his
nose
up
and
down
the
front
of
her
dress
nip
at
the
buttons
and
be
very
happy
if
he
could
get
a
bit
of
her
between
his
strong
teeth
if
he
was
in
the
field
he
never
seemed
to
know
her
till
she
was
right
under
his
eyes
then
he
would
be
delighted
to
see
her
he
was
not
blind
though
for
wood
said
he
was
not
he
said
he
had
probably
not
been
an
horse
to
start
with
and
had
been
made
more
dull
by
cruel
usage
as
for
the
englishman
the
master
of
these
animals
a
very
strange
thing
happened
to
him
he
came
to
a
terrible
end
but
for
a
long
time
no
one
knew
anything
about
it
wood
and
harry
were
so
very
angry
with
him
that
they
said
they
would
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
have
him
punished
or
at
least
to
have
it
known
what
a
villain
he
was
they
sent
the
paper
with
the
crest
on
it
to
boston
some
people
there
wrote
to
england
and
found
out
that
it
was
the
crest
of
a
noble
and
highly
esteemed
family
and
some
earl
was
at
the
head
of
it
they
were
all
honorable
people
in
this
family
except
one
man
a
nephew
not
a
son
of
the
late
earl
he
was
the
black
sheep
of
them
all
as
a
young
man
he
had
led
a
wild
and
wicked
life
and
had
ended
by
forging
the
name
of
one
of
his
friends
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
leave
england
and
take
refuge
in
america
by
the
description
of
this
man
wood
knew
that
he
must
be
barron
so
he
wrote
to
these
english
people
and
told
them
what
a
wicked
thing
their
relative
had
done
in
leaving
his
animals
to
starve
in
a
short
time
he
got
an
answer
from
them
which
was
at
the
same
time
very
proud
and
very
touching
it
came
from
barron
cousin
and
he
said
quite
frankly
that
he
knew
his
relative
was
a
man
of
evil
habits
but
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
could
be
done
to
reform
him
his
family
was
accustomed
to
send
a
quarterly
allowance
to
him
on
condition
that
he
led
a
quiet
life
in
some
retired
place
but
their
last
remittance
to
him
was
lying
unclaimed
in
boston
and
they
thought
he
must
be
dead
could
wood
tell
them
anything
about
him
wood
looked
very
thoughtful
when
he
got
this
letter
then
he
said
harry
how
long
is
it
since
barron
ran
away
about
eight
weeks
said
harry
that
strange
said
wood
the
money
these
english
people
sent
him
would
get
to
boston
just
a
few
days
after
he
left
here
he
is
not
the
man
to
leave
it
long
unclaimed
something
must
have
happened
to
him
where
do
you
suppose
he
would
go
from
penhollow
i
have
no
idea
sir
said
harry
and
how
would
he
go
said
wood
he
did
not
leave
riverdale
station
because
he
would
have
been
spotted
by
some
of
his
creditors
perhaps
he
would
cut
through
the
woods
to
the
junction
said
harry
just
what
he
would
do
said
wood
slapping
his
knee
i
be
driving
over
there
to
see
thompson
and
i
make
inquiries
harry
spoke
to
his
father
the
next
night
when
he
came
home
and
asked
him
if
he
had
found
out
anything
only
this
said
wood
there
no
one
answering
to
barron
description
who
has
left
riverdale
junction
within
a
twelvemonth
he
must
have
struck
some
other
station
we
let
him
go
the
lord
looks
out
for
fellows
like
that
we
will
look
out
for
him
if
he
ever
comes
back
to
riverdale
said
harry
quietly
all
through
the
village
and
in
the
country
it
was
known
what
a
dastardly
trick
the
englishman
had
played
and
he
would
have
been
roughly
handled
if
he
had
dared
return
months
passed
away
and
nothing
was
heard
of
him
late
in
the
autumn
after
miss
laura
and
i
had
gone
back
to
fairport
wood
wrote
her
about
the
end
of
the
englishman
some
riverdale
lads
were
beating
about
the
woods
looking
for
lost
cattle
and
in
their
wanderings
came
to
an
old
stone
quarry
that
had
been
disused
for
years
on
one
side
there
was
a
smooth
wall
of
rock
many
feet
deep
on
the
other
the
ground
and
rock
were
broken
away
and
it
was
quite
easy
to
get
into
it
they
found
that
by
some
means
or
other
one
of
their
cows
had
fallen
into
this
deep
pit
over
the
steep
side
of
the
quarry
of
course
the
poor
creature
was
dead
but
the
boys
out
of
curiosity
resolved
to
go
down
and
look
at
her
they
clambered
down
found
the
cow
and
to
their
horror
and
amazement
discovered
the
skeleton
of
a
man
there
was
a
heavy
by
his
side
which
they
recognized
as
one
that
the
englishman
had
carried
he
was
a
drinking
man
and
perhaps
he
had
taken
something
that
he
thought
would
strengthen
him
for
his
morning
walk
but
which
had
on
the
contrary
bewildered
him
and
made
him
lose
his
way
and
fall
into
the
quarry
or
he
might
have
started
before
daybreak
and
in
the
darkness
have
slipped
and
fallen
down
this
steep
wall
of
rock
one
leg
was
doubled
under
him
and
if
he
had
not
been
instantly
killed
by
the
fall
he
must
have
been
so
disabled
that
he
could
not
move
in
that
lonely
place
he
would
call
for
help
in
vain
so
he
may
have
perished
by
the
terrible
death
of
starvation
the
death
he
had
thought
to
mete
out
to
his
suffering
animals
wood
said
that
there
was
never
a
sermon
preached
in
riverdale
that
had
the
effect
that
the
death
of
this
wicked
man
had
and
it
reminded
her
of
a
verse
in
the
bible
he
made
a
pit
and
he
digged
it
and
is
fallen
into
the
ditch
which
he
made
wood
said
that
her
husband
had
written
about
the
finding
of
barron
body
to
his
english
relatives
and
had
received
a
letter
from
them
in
which
they
seemed
relieved
to
hear
that
he
was
dead
they
thanked
wood
for
his
plain
speaking
in
telling
them
of
their
relative
misdeeds
and
said
that
from
all
they
knew
of
barron
past
conduct
his
influence
would
be
for
evil
and
not
for
good
in
any
place
that
he
choose
to
live
in
they
were
having
their
money
sent
from
boston
to
wood
and
they
wished
him
to
expend
it
in
the
way
he
thought
best
fitted
to
counteract
the
evil
effects
of
their
namesake
doings
in
riverdale
when
this
money
came
it
amounted
to
some
hundreds
of
dollars
wood
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
handed
it
over
to
the
band
of
mercy
and
they
formed
what
they
called
the
barron
fund
which
they
drew
upon
when
they
wanted
money
for
buying
and
circulating
humane
literature
wood
said
that
the
fund
was
being
added
to
and
the
children
were
sending
all
over
the
state
leaflets
and
little
books
which
preached
the
gospel
of
kindness
to
god
lower
creation
a
stranger
picking
one
of
them
up
and
seeing
the
name
of
the
wicked
englishman
printed
on
the
would
think
that
he
was
a
friend
and
benefactor
to
the
riverdale
people
the
very
opposite
of
what
he
gloried
in
being
chapter
xxix
a
talk
about
sheep
miss
laura
was
very
much
interested
in
the
sheep
on
dingley
farm
there
was
a
flock
in
the
orchard
near
the
house
that
she
often
went
to
see
she
always
carried
roots
and
vegetables
to
them
turnips
particularly
for
they
were
very
fond
of
them
but
they
would
not
come
to
her
to
get
them
for
they
did
not
know
her
voice
they
only
lifted
their
heads
and
stared
at
her
when
she
called
them
but
when
they
heard
voice
they
ran
to
the
fence
bleating
with
pleasure
and
trying
to
push
their
noses
through
to
get
the
carrot
or
turnip
or
whatever
he
was
handing
to
them
he
called
them
his
little
southdowns
and
he
said
he
loved
his
sheep
for
they
were
the
most
gentle
and
inoffensive
creatures
that
he
had
on
his
farm
one
day
when
he
came
into
the
kitchen
inquiring
for
salt
miss
laura
said
is
it
for
the
sheep
yes
he
replied
i
am
going
up
to
the
woods
pasture
to
examine
my
shropshires
you
would
like
to
go
too
laura
said
wood
take
your
hands
right
away
from
that
cake
i
finish
frosting
it
for
you
run
along
and
get
your
hat
it
very
hot
miss
laura
danced
out
into
the
hall
and
back
again
and
soon
we
were
walking
up
back
of
the
house
along
a
path
that
led
us
through
the
fields
to
the
pasture
what
are
you
going
to
do
uncle
she
said
and
what
are
those
funny
things
in
your
hands
he
replied
and
i
am
going
to
examine
the
hoofs
you
know
we
had
warm
moist
weather
all
through
july
and
afraid
of
then
they
sometimes
troubled
with
overgrown
hoofs
what
do
you
do
if
they
get
asked
miss
laura
i
various
cures
he
said
paring
and
clipping
and
dipping
the
hoof
in
blue
vitriol
and
vinegar
or
rubbing
it
on
as
the
english
shepherds
do
it
destroys
the
diseased
part
but
does
affect
the
sound
do
sheep
have
many
diseases
asked
miss
laura
i
know
one
of
them
myself
that
is
the
scab
a
nasty
thing
that
said
wood
vigorously
and
a
man
that
builds
up
a
flock
from
a
stockyard
often
finds
it
out
to
his
cost
what
is
it
like
asked
miss
laura
the
sheep
get
scabby
from
a
microbe
under
the
skin
which
causes
them
to
itch
fearfully
and
they
lose
their
wool
and
ca
it
be
cured
oh
yes
with
time
and
attention
there
are
different
remedies
i
believe
petroleum
is
the
best
by
this
time
we
had
got
to
a
wide
gate
that
opened
into
the
pasture
as
wood
let
miss
laura
go
through
and
then
closed
it
behind
her
he
said
you
are
looking
at
that
gate
you
want
to
know
why
it
is
so
long
do
you
yes
uncle
she
said
but
i
ca
bear
to
ask
so
many
questions
ask
as
many
as
you
like
he
said
i
do
mind
answering
them
have
you
ever
seen
sheep
pass
through
a
gate
or
door
oh
yes
often
and
how
do
they
act
oh
so
silly
uncle
they
hang
back
and
one
waits
for
another
and
finally
they
all
try
to
go
at
once
precisely
when
one
goes
they
all
want
to
go
if
it
was
to
jump
into
a
bottomless
pit
many
sheep
are
injured
by
overcrowding
so
i
have
my
gates
and
doors
very
wide
now
let
us
call
them
up
there
was
one
in
sight
but
when
wood
lifted
up
his
voice
and
cried
ca
nan
nan
nan
black
faces
began
to
peer
out
from
among
the
bushes
and
little
black
legs
carrying
white
bodies
came
hurrying
up
the
stony
paths
from
the
cooler
parts
of
the
pasture
oh
how
glad
they
were
to
get
the
salt
wood
let
miss
laura
spread
it
on
some
flat
rocks
then
they
sat
down
on
a
log
under
a
tree
and
watched
them
eating
it
and
licking
the
rocks
when
it
was
all
gone
miss
laura
sat
fanning
herself
with
her
hat
and
smiling
at
them
you
funny
woolly
things
she
said
you
not
so
stupid
as
some
people
think
you
are
lie
still
joe
if
you
show
yourself
they
may
run
away
i
crouched
behind
the
log
and
only
lifted
my
head
occasionally
to
see
what
the
sheep
were
doing
some
of
them
went
back
into
the
woods
for
it
was
very
hot
in
this
bare
part
of
the
pasture
but
the
most
of
them
would
not
leave
wood
and
stood
staring
at
him
that
a
fine
sheep
is
it
said
miss
laura
pointing
to
one
with
the
blackest
face
and
the
blackest
legs
and
largest
body
of
those
near
us
yes
that
old
jessica
do
you
notice
how
she
holding
her
head
close
to
the
ground
yes
is
there
any
reason
for
it
there
is
she
afraid
of
the
grub
fly
you
often
see
sheep
holding
their
noses
in
that
way
in
the
summer
time
it
is
to
prevent
the
fly
from
going
into
their
nostrils
and
depositing
an
egg
which
will
turn
into
a
grub
and
annoy
and
worry
them
when
the
fly
comes
near
they
give
a
sniff
and
run
as
if
they
were
crazy
still
holding
their
noses
close
to
the
ground
when
i
was
a
boy
and
the
sheep
did
that
we
thought
that
they
had
colds
in
their
heads
and
used
to
rub
tar
on
their
noses
we
knew
nothing
about
the
fly
then
but
the
tar
cured
them
and
is
just
what
i
use
now
two
or
three
times
a
month
during
hot
weather
we
put
a
few
drops
of
it
on
the
nose
of
every
sheep
in
the
flock
i
suppose
farmers
are
like
other
people
and
are
always
finding
out
better
ways
of
doing
their
work
are
they
uncle
said
miss
laura
yes
my
child
the
older
i
grow
the
more
i
find
out
and
the
better
care
i
take
of
my
stock
my
grandfather
would
open
his
eyes
in
amazement
and
ask
me
if
i
was
an
old
women
petting
her
cats
if
he
were
alive
and
could
know
the
care
i
give
my
sheep
he
used
to
let
his
flock
run
till
the
fields
were
covered
with
snow
and
bite
as
close
as
they
liked
till
there
was
a
scrap
of
feed
left
then
he
would
give
them
an
open
shed
to
run
under
and
throw
down
their
hay
outside
grain
they
scarcely
knew
the
taste
of
that
they
would
fall
off
in
flesh
and
half
of
them
lose
their
lambs
in
the
spring
was
an
expected
thing
he
would
say
i
had
them
kennelled
if
he
could
see
my
big
closed
sheds
with
the
sunny
windows
that
my
flock
spend
the
winter
in
i
even
house
them
during
the
bad
fall
storms
they
can
run
out
again
indeed
i
like
to
get
them
in
and
have
a
snack
of
dry
food
to
break
them
in
to
it
they
are
in
and
out
of
those
sheds
all
winter
you
must
go
in
laura
and
see
the
racks
on
bright
winter
days
they
get
a
run
in
the
cornfields
cold
does
hurt
sheep
it
the
heavy
rain
that
soaks
their
fleeces
with
my
way
i
seldom
lose
a
sheep
and
they
the
most
profitable
stock
i
have
if
i
could
not
keep
them
i
think
i
give
up
farming
last
year
my
lambs
netted
me
eight
dollars
each
the
fleeces
of
the
ewes
average
eight
pounds
and
sell
for
two
dollars
each
that
something
to
brag
of
in
these
days
when
so
many
are
giving
up
the
sheep
industry
how
many
sheep
have
you
uncle
asked
miss
laura
only
fifty
now
here
and
down
below
in
the
orchard
i
been
selling
a
good
many
this
spring
these
sheep
are
larger
than
those
in
the
orchard
are
they
said
miss
laura
yes
i
keep
those
few
southdowns
for
their
fine
quality
i
do
make
as
much
on
them
as
i
do
on
these
shropshires
for
an
sheep
i
like
the
shropshire
it
good
for
mutton
for
wool
and
for
rearing
lambs
there
a
great
demand
for
mutton
nowadays
all
through
our
eastern
cities
people
want
more
and
more
of
it
and
it
has
to
be
tender
and
juicy
and
finely
flavored
so
a
person
has
to
be
particular
about
the
feed
the
sheep
get
do
you
hate
to
have
these
creatures
killed
that
you
have
raised
and
tended
so
carefully
said
miss
laura
with
a
little
shudder
i
do
said
her
uncle
but
never
an
animal
goes
off
my
place
that
i
do
know
just
how
it
going
to
be
put
to
death
none
of
your
sending
sheep
to
market
with
their
legs
tied
together
and
jammed
in
a
cart
and
sweating
and
suffering
for
me
they
got
to
go
standing
comfortably
on
their
legs
or
go
not
at
all
and
i
going
to
know
the
butcher
that
kills
my
animals
that
have
been
petted
like
children
i
said
to
davidson
over
there
in
hoytville
i
thought
you
would
herd
my
sheep
and
lambs
and
calves
together
and
take
them
one
by
one
in
sight
of
the
rest
and
stick
your
knife
into
them
or
stun
them
and
have
the
others
lowing
and
bleating
and
crying
in
their
misery
this
is
the
last
consignment
you
would
ever
get
from
me
he
said
i
do
like
my
business
but
on
the
word
of
an
honest
man
my
butchering
is
done
as
well
as
it
can
be
come
and
see
for
yourself
he
took
me
to
his
and
though
i
did
stay
long
i
saw
enough
to
convince
me
that
he
spoke
the
truth
he
has
different
pens
and
sheds
and
the
killing
is
done
as
quietly
as
possible
the
animals
are
taken
in
one
by
one
and
though
the
others
suspect
what
is
going
on
they
ca
see
it
these
sheep
are
a
long
way
from
the
house
said
miss
laura
do
the
dogs
that
you
were
telling
me
about
attack
them
no
for
since
i
had
that
brush
with
windham
dog
i
trained
them
to
go
and
come
with
the
cows
it
a
queer
thing
but
cows
that
will
run
from
a
dog
when
they
are
alone
will
fight
him
if
he
meddles
with
their
calves
or
the
sheep
there
not
a
dog
around
that
would
dare
to
come
into
this
pasture
for
he
knows
the
cows
would
be
after
him
with
lowered
horns
and
a
business
look
in
their
eyes
the
sheep
in
the
orchard
are
safe
enough
for
they
near
the
house
and
if
a
strange
dog
came
around
joe
would
settle
him
would
you
joe
and
wood
looked
behind
the
log
at
me
i
got
up
and
put
my
head
on
his
arm
and
he
went
on
by
and
by
the
southdowns
will
be
changed
up
here
and
the
shropshires
will
go
down
to
the
orchard
i
like
to
keep
one
flock
under
my
fruit
trees
you
know
there
is
an
old
proverb
sheep
has
a
golden
hoof
they
save
me
the
trouble
of
ploughing
i
have
ploughed
my
orchard
for
ten
years
and
do
expect
to
plough
it
for
ten
years
more
then
your
aunt
hens
are
so
obliging
that
they
keep
me
from
the
worry
of
finding
ticks
at
shearing
time
all
the
year
round
i
let
them
run
among
the
sheep
and
they
nab
every
tick
they
see
how
closely
sheep
bite
exclaimed
miss
laura
pointing
to
one
that
was
nibbling
almost
at
his
master
feet
very
close
and
they
eat
a
good
many
things
that
cows
relish
bitter
weeds
and
briars
and
shrubs
and
the
young
ferns
that
come
up
in
the
spring
i
wish
i
could
get
hold
of
one
of
those
dear
little
lambs
said
miss
laura
see
that
sweet
little
blackie
back
in
the
alders
could
you
not
coax
him
up
he
would
come
here
said
her
uncle
kindly
but
i
try
and
get
him
for
you
he
rose
and
after
several
efforts
succeeded
in
capturing
the
creature
and
bringing
him
up
to
the
log
he
was
very
shy
of
miss
laura
but
wood
held
him
firmly
and
let
her
stroke
his
head
as
much
as
she
liked
you
call
him
little
said
wood
if
you
put
your
arm
around
him
you
find
he
a
pretty
substantial
lamb
he
was
born
in
march
this
is
the
last
of
july
he
be
shorn
the
middle
of
next
month
and
think
he
quite
grown
up
poor
little
animal
he
had
quite
a
struggle
for
life
the
sheep
were
turned
out
to
pasture
in
april
they
ca
bear
confinement
as
well
as
the
cows
and
as
they
bite
closer
they
can
be
turned
out
earlier
and
get
on
well
by
having
good
rations
of
corn
in
addition
to
the
grass
which
is
thin
and
poor
so
early
in
the
spring
this
young
creature
was
running
by
his
side
rather
a
poor
specimen
of
a
lamb
every
night
the
flock
was
put
under
shelter
for
the
ground
was
cold
and
though
the
sheep
might
not
suffer
from
lying
the
lambs
would
get
chilled
one
night
this
fellow
mother
got
astray
and
as
ben
neglected
to
make
the
count
she
was
missed
i
always
anxious
about
my
lambs
in
the
spring
and
often
get
up
in
the
night
to
look
after
them
that
night
i
went
out
about
two
i
took
it
into
my
head
for
some
reason
or
other
to
count
them
i
found
a
sheep
and
lamb
missing
took
my
lantern
and
bruno
who
was
some
good
at
tracking
sheep
and
started
out
bruno
barked
and
i
called
and
the
foolish
creature
came
to
me
the
little
lamb
staggering
after
her
i
wrapped
the
lamb
in
my
coat
took
it
to
the
house
made
a
fire
and
heated
some
milk
your
aunt
hattie
heard
me
and
got
up
she
wo
let
me
give
brandy
even
to
a
dumb
beast
so
i
put
some
ground
ginger
which
is
just
as
good
in
the
milk
and
forced
it
down
the
lamb
throat
then
we
wrapped
an
old
blanket
round
him
and
put
him
near
the
stove
and
the
next
evening
he
was
ready
to
go
back
to
his
mother
i
petted
him
all
through
april
and
gave
him
extras
different
kinds
of
meal
till
i
found
what
suited
him
best
now
he
does
me
credit
dear
little
lamb
said
miss
laura
patting
him
how
can
you
tell
him
from
the
others
uncle
i
know
all
their
faces
laura
a
flock
of
sheep
is
just
like
a
crowd
of
people
they
all
have
different
expressions
and
have
different
dispositions
they
all
look
alike
to
me
said
miss
laura
i
dare
say
you
are
not
accustomed
to
them
do
you
know
how
to
tell
a
sheep
age
no
uncle
here
open
your
mouth
cosset
he
said
to
the
lamb
that
he
still
held
at
one
year
they
have
two
teeth
in
the
centre
of
the
jaw
they
get
two
teeth
more
every
year
up
to
five
years
then
we
say
they
have
full
mouth
after
that
you
ca
tell
their
age
exactly
by
the
teeth
now
run
back
to
your
mother
and
he
let
the
lamb
go
do
they
always
know
their
own
mothers
asked
miss
laura
usually
sometimes
a
ewe
will
not
own
her
lamb
in
that
case
we
tie
them
up
in
a
separate
stall
till
she
recognizes
it
do
you
see
that
sheep
over
there
by
the
blueberry
bushes
the
one
with
the
very
pointed
ears
yes
uncle
said
miss
laura
that
lamb
by
her
side
is
not
her
own
hers
died
and
we
took
its
fleece
and
wrapped
it
around
a
twin
lamb
that
we
took
from
another
ewe
and
gave
to
her
she
soon
adopted
it
now
come
this
way
and
i
show
you
our
movable
feeding
troughs
he
got
up
from
the
log
and
miss
laura
followed
him
to
the
fence
these
big
troughs
are
for
the
sheep
sad
wood
and
those
shallow
ones
in
the
enclosure
are
for
the
lambs
see
there
is
just
room
enough
for
them
to
get
under
the
fence
you
should
see
the
small
creatures
rush
to
them
whenever
we
appear
with
their
oats
and
wheat
or
bran
or
whatever
we
are
going
to
give
them
if
they
are
going
to
the
butcher
they
get
corn
meal
and
oil
meal
whatever
it
is
they
eat
it
up
clean
i
do
believe
in
cramming
animals
i
feed
them
as
much
as
is
good
for
them
and
not
any
more
now
you
go
sit
down
over
there
behind
those
bushes
with
joe
and
i
attend
to
business
miss
laura
found
a
shady
place
and
i
curled
myself
up
beside
her
we
sat
there
a
long
time
but
we
did
not
get
tired
for
it
was
amusing
to
watch
the
sheep
and
lambs
after
a
while
wood
came
and
sat
down
beside
us
he
talked
some
more
about
then
he
said
you
may
stay
here
longer
if
you
like
but
i
must
get
down
to
the
house
the
work
must
be
done
if
the
weather
is
hot
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
asked
miss
laura
jumping
up
oh
more
sheep
business
i
set
out
some
young
trees
in
the
orchard
and
unless
i
get
chicken
wire
around
them
my
sheep
will
be
barking
them
for
me
i
seen
them
said
miss
laura
standing
up
on
their
hind
legs
and
nibbling
at
the
trees
taking
off
every
shoot
they
can
reach
they
do
hurt
the
old
trees
said
wood
but
the
young
ones
have
to
be
protected
it
pays
me
to
take
care
of
my
fruit
trees
for
i
get
a
splendid
crop
from
them
thanks
to
the
sheep
little
lambs
and
dear
old
sheep
said
miss
laura
as
her
uncle
opened
the
gate
for
her
to
leave
the
pasture
i
come
and
see
you
again
some
time
now
you
had
better
go
down
to
the
brook
in
the
dingle
and
have
a
drink
you
look
hot
in
your
warm
coats
you
mastered
one
detail
of
said
wood
as
he
slowly
walked
along
beside
his
niece
to
raise
healthy
sheep
one
must
have
pure
water
where
they
can
get
to
it
whenever
they
like
give
them
good
water
good
food
and
a
variety
of
it
good
quarters
cool
in
summer
comfortable
in
winter
and
keep
them
quiet
and
you
make
them
happy
and
make
money
on
them
i
think
i
like
said
miss
laura
wo
you
have
me
for
your
flock
mistress
uncle
he
laughed
and
said
he
thought
not
for
she
would
cry
every
time
any
of
her
charge
were
sent
to
the
butcher
after
this
miss
laura
and
i
often
went
up
to
the
pasture
to
see
the
sheep
and
the
lambs
we
used
to
get
into
a
shady
place
where
they
could
not
see
us
and
watch
them
one
day
i
got
a
great
surprise
about
the
sheep
i
had
heard
so
much
about
their
meekness
that
i
never
dreamed
that
they
would
fight
but
it
turned
out
that
they
did
and
they
went
about
it
in
such
a
way
that
i
could
not
help
smiling
at
them
i
suppose
that
like
most
other
animals
they
had
a
spice
of
wickedness
in
them
on
this
day
a
quarrel
arose
between
two
sheep
but
instead
of
running
at
each
other
like
two
dogs
they
went
a
long
distance
apart
and
then
came
rushing
at
each
other
with
lowered
heads
their
object
seemed
to
be
to
break
each
other
skull
but
miss
laura
soon
stopped
them
by
calling
out
and
frightening
them
apart
i
thought
that
the
lambs
were
more
interesting
than
the
sheep
sometimes
they
fed
quietly
by
their
mothers
sides
and
at
other
times
they
all
huddled
together
on
the
top
of
some
flat
rock
or
in
a
bare
place
and
seemed
to
be
talking
to
each
other
with
their
heads
close
together
suddenly
one
would
jump
down
and
start
for
the
bushes
or
the
other
side
of
the
pasture
they
would
all
follow
then
in
a
few
minutes
they
would
come
rushing
back
again
it
was
pretty
to
see
them
playing
together
and
having
a
good
time
before
the
sorrowful
day
of
their
death
came
chapter
xxx
a
jealous
ox
wood
had
a
dozen
calves
that
he
was
raising
and
miss
laura
sometimes
went
up
to
the
stable
to
see
them
each
calf
was
in
a
crib
and
it
was
fed
with
milk
they
had
gentle
patient
faces
and
beautiful
eyes
and
looked
very
meek
as
they
stood
quietly
gazing
about
them
or
sucking
away
at
their
milk
they
reminded
me
of
big
gentle
dogs
i
never
got
a
very
good
look
at
them
in
their
cribs
but
one
day
when
they
were
old
enough
to
be
let
out
i
went
up
with
miss
laura
to
the
yard
where
they
were
kept
such
queer
ungainly
creatures
they
were
and
such
a
good
time
they
were
having
running
and
jumping
and
throwing
up
their
heels
wood
was
with
us
and
she
said
that
it
was
not
good
for
calves
to
be
closely
penned
after
they
got
to
be
a
few
weeks
old
they
were
better
for
getting
out
and
having
a
frolic
she
stood
beside
miss
laura
for
a
long
time
watching
the
calves
and
laughing
a
great
deal
at
their
awkward
gambols
they
wanted
to
play
but
they
did
not
seem
to
know
how
to
use
their
limbs
they
were
lean
calves
and
miss
laura
asked
her
aunt
why
all
the
nice
milk
they
had
taken
had
not
made
them
fat
the
fat
will
come
all
in
good
time
said
wood
a
fat
calf
makes
a
poor
cow
and
a
fat
small
calf
is
profitable
to
fit
for
sending
to
the
butcher
better
to
have
a
bony
one
and
fatten
it
if
you
come
here
next
summer
you
see
a
fine
show
of
young
cattle
with
fat
sides
and
big
open
horns
and
a
good
coat
of
hair
can
you
imagine
she
went
on
indignantly
that
any
one
could
be
cruel
enough
to
torture
such
a
harmless
creature
as
a
calf
no
indeed
replied
miss
laura
who
has
been
doing
it
who
has
been
doing
it
repeated
wood
bitterly
they
are
doing
it
all
the
time
do
you
know
what
makes
the
nice
white
veal
one
gets
in
big
cities
the
calves
are
bled
to
death
they
linger
for
hours
and
moan
their
lives
away
the
first
time
i
heard
it
i
was
so
angry
that
i
cried
for
a
day
and
made
john
promise
that
he
never
send
another
animal
of
his
to
a
big
city
to
be
killed
that
why
all
of
our
stock
goes
to
hoytville
and
small
country
places
oh
those
big
cities
are
awful
places
laura
it
seems
to
me
that
it
makes
people
wicked
to
huddle
them
together
i
rather
live
in
a
desert
than
a
city
ch
o
every
night
since
i
been
there
i
pray
to
the
lord
either
to
change
the
hearts
of
some
of
the
wicked
people
in
it
or
to
destroy
them
off
the
face
of
the
earth
you
know
three
years
ago
i
got
run
down
and
your
uncle
said
i
got
to
have
a
change
so
he
sent
me
off
to
my
brother
in
ch
i
stayed
and
enjoyed
myself
pretty
well
for
it
is
a
wonderful
city
till
one
day
some
western
men
came
in
who
had
been
visiting
the
slaughter
houses
outside
the
city
i
sat
and
listened
to
their
talk
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
hearing
the
description
of
a
great
battle
these
men
were
cattle
dealers
and
had
been
sending
stock
to
ch
o
and
they
were
furious
that
men
in
their
rage
for
wealth
would
so
utterly
ignore
and
trample
on
all
decent
and
humane
feelings
as
to
torture
animals
as
the
ch
o
men
were
doing
it
is
too
dreadful
to
repeat
the
sights
they
saw
i
listened
till
they
were
describing
texan
steers
kicking
in
agony
under
the
torture
that
was
practised
and
then
i
gave
a
loud
scream
and
fainted
dead
away
they
had
to
send
for
your
uncle
and
he
brought
me
home
and
for
days
and
days
i
heard
nothing
but
shouting
and
swearing
and
saw
animals
dripping
with
blood
and
crying
and
moaning
in
their
anguish
and
now
laura
if
you
lay
down
a
bit
of
ch
o
meat
and
cover
it
with
gold
spurn
it
from
me
but
what
am
i
saying
you
as
white
as
a
sheet
come
and
see
the
cow
stable
john
just
had
it
whitewashed
miss
laura
took
her
aunt
arm
and
i
walked
slowly
behind
them
the
cow
stable
was
a
long
building
and
with
no
chinks
in
the
walls
as
jenkins
stable
had
there
were
large
windows
where
the
afternoon
sun
came
streaming
in
and
a
number
of
ventilators
and
a
great
many
stalls
a
pipe
of
water
ran
through
the
stalls
from
one
end
of
the
stable
to
the
other
the
floor
was
covered
with
sawdust
and
leaves
and
the
ceiling
and
tops
of
the
walls
were
whitewashed
wood
said
that
her
husband
would
not
have
the
walls
a
glare
of
white
right
down
to
the
floor
because
he
thought
it
injured
the
animals
eyes
so
the
lower
parts
of
the
walls
were
stained
a
dark
brown
color
there
were
doors
at
each
end
of
the
stable
and
just
now
they
stood
open
and
a
gentle
breeze
was
blowing
through
but
wood
said
that
when
the
cattle
stood
in
the
stalls
both
doors
were
never
allowed
to
be
open
at
the
same
time
wood
was
most
particular
to
have
no
drafts
blowing
upon
his
cattle
he
would
not
have
them
chilled
and
he
would
not
have
them
overheated
one
thing
was
as
bad
as
the
other
and
during
the
winter
they
were
never
allowed
to
drink
icy
water
he
took
the
chill
off
the
water
for
his
cows
just
as
wood
did
for
her
hens
you
know
laura
wood
went
on
that
when
cows
are
kept
dry
and
warm
they
eat
less
than
when
they
are
cold
and
wet
they
are
so
that
if
they
are
cold
they
have
to
eat
a
great
deal
to
keep
up
the
heat
of
their
bodies
so
it
pays
better
to
house
and
feed
them
well
they
like
quiet
too
i
never
knew
that
till
i
married
your
uncle
on
our
farm
the
boys
always
shouted
and
screamed
at
the
cows
when
they
were
driving
them
and
sometimes
they
made
them
run
never
allowed
to
do
that
here
i
have
noticed
how
quiet
this
farm
seems
said
miss
laura
you
have
so
many
men
about
and
yet
there
is
so
little
noise
your
uncle
whistles
a
great
deal
said
wood
have
you
noticed
that
he
whistles
when
he
about
his
work
and
then
he
has
a
calling
whistle
that
nearly
all
of
the
animals
know
and
the
men
run
when
they
hear
it
you
see
every
cow
in
this
stable
turn
its
head
if
he
whistled
in
a
certain
way
outside
he
says
that
he
got
into
the
way
of
doing
it
when
he
was
a
boy
and
went
for
his
father
cows
he
trained
them
so
that
he
just
stand
in
the
pasture
and
whistle
and
they
come
to
him
i
believe
the
first
thing
that
inclined
me
to
him
was
his
clear
happy
whistle
i
hear
him
from
our
house
away
down
on
the
road
jogging
along
with
his
cart
or
driving
in
his
buggy
he
says
there
is
no
need
of
screaming
at
any
animal
it
only
frightens
and
angers
them
they
will
mind
much
better
if
you
speak
clearly
and
distinctly
he
says
there
is
only
one
thing
an
animal
hates
more
than
to
be
shouted
at
and
that
to
be
crept
on
to
have
a
person
sneak
up
to
it
and
startle
it
john
says
many
a
man
is
kicked
because
he
comes
up
to
his
horse
like
a
thief
a
startled
animal
first
instinct
is
to
defend
itself
a
dog
will
spring
at
you
and
a
horse
will
let
his
heels
fly
john
always
speaks
or
whistles
to
let
the
stock
know
when
he
approaching
where
is
uncle
this
afternoon
asked
miss
laura
oh
up
to
his
eyes
in
hay
he
even
got
one
of
the
oxen
harnessed
to
a
hay
cart
i
wonder
whether
it
duke
said
miss
laura
yes
it
is
i
saw
the
star
on
his
forehead
replied
wood
i
do
know
when
i
have
laughed
at
anything
as
much
as
i
did
at
him
the
other
day
said
miss
laura
uncle
asked
me
if
i
had
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
as
a
jealous
ox
and
i
said
no
he
said
to
the
barnyard
and
i
show
you
one
the
oxen
were
both
there
duke
with
his
broad
face
and
bright
so
much
sharper
and
more
intelligent
looking
duke
was
drinking
at
the
trough
there
and
uncle
said
look
at
him
is
he
a
great
fat
creature
and
does
he
look
as
if
he
thought
the
world
owed
him
a
living
and
he
ought
to
get
it
then
he
got
the
card
and
went
up
to
bright
and
began
scratching
him
duke
lifted
his
head
from
the
trough
and
stared
at
uncle
who
paid
no
attention
to
him
but
went
on
carding
bright
and
stroking
and
petting
him
duke
looked
so
angry
he
left
the
trough
and
with
the
water
dripping
from
his
lips
went
up
to
uncle
and
gave
him
a
push
with
his
horns
still
uncle
took
no
notice
and
duke
almost
pushed
him
over
then
uncle
left
off
petting
bright
and
turned
to
him
he
said
duke
would
have
treated
him
roughly
if
he
had
i
never
saw
a
creature
look
as
satisfied
as
duke
did
when
uncle
began
to
card
him
bright
did
seem
to
care
and
only
gazed
calmly
at
them
i
seen
duke
do
that
again
and
again
said
wood
he
the
most
jealous
animal
that
we
have
and
it
makes
him
perfectly
miserable
to
have
your
uncle
pay
attention
to
any
animal
but
him
what
queer
creatures
these
dumb
brutes
are
they
pretty
much
like
us
in
most
ways
they
jealous
and
resentful
and
they
can
love
or
hate
equally
well
and
forgive
too
for
that
matter
and
suffer
how
they
can
suffer
and
so
patiently
too
where
is
the
human
being
that
would
put
up
with
the
tortures
that
animals
endure
and
yet
come
out
so
patient
nowhere
said
miss
laura
in
a
low
voice
we
could
do
it
and
there
does
seem
to
be
an
animal
wood
went
on
no
matter
how
ugly
and
repulsive
it
is
but
what
has
some
lovable
qualities
i
have
just
been
reading
about
some
sewer
rats
louise
michel
rats
who
is
she
asked
miss
laura
a
celebrated
frenchwoman
my
dear
child
priestess
of
pity
and
vengeance
stead
calls
her
you
are
too
young
to
know
about
her
but
i
remember
reading
of
her
in
during
the
commune
troubles
in
france
she
is
an
anarchist
and
she
used
to
wear
a
uniform
and
shoulder
a
rifle
and
help
to
build
barricades
she
was
arrested
and
sent
as
a
convict
to
one
of
the
french
penal
colonies
she
has
a
most
wonderful
love
for
animals
in
her
heart
and
when
she
went
home
she
took
four
cats
with
her
she
was
put
into
prison
again
in
france
and
took
the
cats
with
her
rats
came
about
her
cell
and
she
petted
them
and
taught
her
cats
to
be
kind
to
them
before
she
got
the
cats
thoroughly
drilled
one
of
them
bit
a
rat
paw
louise
nursed
the
rat
till
it
got
well
then
let
it
down
by
a
string
from
her
window
it
went
back
to
its
sewer
and
i
suppose
told
the
other
rats
how
kind
louise
had
been
to
it
for
after
that
they
came
to
her
cell
without
fear
mother
rats
brought
their
young
ones
and
placed
them
at
her
feet
as
if
to
ask
her
protection
for
them
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
them
was
their
affection
for
each
other
young
rats
would
chew
the
crusts
thrown
to
old
toothless
rats
so
that
they
might
more
easily
eat
them
and
if
a
young
rat
dared
help
itself
before
an
old
one
the
others
punished
it
that
sounds
very
interesting
auntie
said
miss
laura
where
did
you
read
it
i
have
just
got
the
magazine
said
wood
you
shall
have
it
as
soon
as
you
come
into
the
house
i
love
to
be
with
you
dear
auntie
said
miss
laura
putting
her
arm
affectionately
around
her
as
they
stood
in
the
doorway
because
you
understand
me
when
i
talk
about
animals
i
ca
explain
it
went
on
my
dear
young
mistress
laying
her
hand
on
her
heart
the
feeling
i
have
here
for
them
i
just
love
a
dumb
creature
and
i
want
to
stop
and
talk
to
every
one
i
see
sometimes
i
worry
poor
bessie
drury
and
i
so
sorry
but
i
ca
help
it
she
says
makes
you
so
silly
laura
miss
laura
was
standing
just
where
the
sunlight
shone
through
her
hair
and
made
her
face
all
in
a
glow
i
thought
she
looked
more
beautiful
than
i
had
ever
seen
her
before
and
i
think
wood
thought
the
same
she
turned
around
and
put
both
hands
on
miss
shoulders
laura
she
said
earnestly
there
are
enough
cold
hearts
in
the
world
do
you
ever
stifle
a
warm
or
tender
feeling
toward
a
dumb
creature
that
is
your
chief
attraction
my
child
your
love
for
everything
that
breathes
and
moves
tear
out
the
selfishness
from
your
heart
if
there
is
any
there
but
let
the
love
and
pity
stay
and
now
let
me
talk
a
little
more
to
you
about
the
cows
i
want
to
interest
you
in
dairy
matters
this
stable
is
new
since
you
were
here
and
we
made
a
number
of
improvements
do
you
see
those
bits
of
rock
salt
in
each
stall
they
are
for
the
cows
to
lick
whenever
they
want
to
now
come
here
and
i
show
you
what
we
call
black
hole
it
was
a
tiny
stable
off
the
main
one
and
it
was
very
dark
and
cool
is
this
a
place
of
punishment
asked
miss
laura
in
surprise
wood
laughed
heartily
no
no
a
place
of
pleasure
sometimes
when
the
flies
are
very
bad
and
the
cows
are
brought
into
the
yard
to
be
milked
and
a
fresh
swarm
settles
on
them
they
are
nearly
frantic
and
though
they
are
the
best
cows
in
new
hampshire
they
will
kick
a
little
when
they
do
those
that
are
the
worst
are
brought
in
here
to
be
milked
where
there
are
no
flies
the
others
have
big
strips
of
cotton
laid
over
their
backs
and
tied
under
them
and
the
men
brush
their
legs
with
tansy
tea
or
water
with
a
little
carbolic
acid
in
it
that
keeps
the
flies
away
and
the
cows
know
just
as
well
that
it
is
done
for
their
comfort
and
stand
quietly
till
the
milking
is
over
i
must
ask
john
to
have
their
nightdresses
put
on
sometimes
for
you
to
see
harry
calls
them
ghosts
and
they
do
look
queer
enough
standing
all
round
the
barnyard
robed
in
white
chapter
xxxi
in
the
cow
stable
is
it
a
strange
thing
said
miss
laura
that
a
little
thing
like
a
fly
can
cause
so
much
annoyance
to
animals
as
well
as
to
people
sometimes
when
i
am
trying
to
get
more
sleep
in
the
morning
their
little
feet
tickle
me
so
that
i
am
nearly
frantic
and
have
to
fly
out
of
bed
you
shall
have
some
netting
to
put
over
your
bed
said
wood
but
suppose
laura
you
had
no
hands
to
brush
away
the
flies
suppose
your
whole
body
was
covered
with
them
and
you
were
tied
up
somewhere
and
could
not
get
loose
i
ca
imagine
more
exquisite
torture
myself
last
summer
the
flies
here
were
dreadful
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
getting
worse
and
worse
every
year
and
worry
the
animals
more
i
believe
it
is
because
the
birds
are
getting
thinned
out
all
over
the
country
there
are
not
enough
of
them
to
catch
the
flies
john
says
that
the
next
improvements
we
make
on
the
farm
are
to
be
wire
gauze
at
all
the
stable
windows
and
screen
doors
to
keep
the
little
pests
from
the
horses
and
cattle
one
afternoon
last
summer
maxwell
mother
came
for
me
to
go
for
a
drive
with
her
the
heat
was
intense
and
when
we
got
down
by
the
river
she
proposed
getting
out
of
the
phaeton
and
sitting
under
the
trees
to
see
if
it
would
be
any
cooler
she
was
driving
a
horse
that
she
had
got
from
the
hotel
in
the
village
a
roan
horse
that
was
clipped
and
and
had
his
tail
docked
i
would
drive
behind
a
tailless
horse
now
then
i
was
so
particular
however
i
made
her
unfasten
the
before
i
set
foot
in
the
carriage
well
i
thought
that
horse
would
go
mad
he
tremble
and
shiver
and
look
so
pitifully
at
us
the
flies
were
nearly
eating
him
up
then
he
start
a
little
maxwell
had
a
weight
at
his
head
to
hold
him
but
he
could
easily
have
dragged
that
he
was
a
good
dispositioned
horse
and
he
did
want
to
run
away
but
he
could
not
stand
still
i
soon
jumped
up
and
slapped
him
and
rubbed
him
till
my
hands
were
dripping
wet
the
poor
brute
was
so
grateful
and
would
keep
touching
my
arm
with
his
nose
maxwell
sat
under
the
trees
fanning
herself
and
laughing
at
me
but
i
did
care
how
could
i
enjoy
myself
with
a
dumb
creature
writhing
in
pain
before
me
a
docked
horse
can
neither
eat
nor
sleep
comfortably
in
the
fly
season
in
one
of
our
new
england
villages
they
have
a
sign
up
taken
in
to
grass
long
tails
one
dollar
and
fifty
cents
short
tails
one
dollar
and
it
just
means
that
the
ones
are
taken
cheaper
because
they
are
so
bothered
by
the
flies
that
they
ca
eat
much
while
the
ones
are
able
to
brush
them
away
and
eat
in
peace
i
read
the
other
day
of
a
buffalo
coal
dealer
horse
that
was
in
such
an
agony
through
flies
that
he
committed
suicide
you
know
animals
will
do
that
i
read
of
horses
and
dogs
drowning
themselves
this
horse
had
been
clipped
and
his
tail
was
docked
and
he
was
turned
out
to
graze
the
flies
stung
him
till
he
was
nearly
crazy
he
ran
up
to
a
picket
fence
and
sprang
up
on
the
sharp
spikes
there
he
hung
making
no
effort
to
get
down
some
men
saw
him
and
they
said
it
was
a
clear
case
of
suicide
i
would
like
to
have
the
power
to
take
every
man
who
cuts
off
a
tail
and
tie
his
hands
and
turn
him
out
in
a
field
in
the
hot
sun
with
little
clothing
on
and
plenty
of
flies
about
then
we
would
see
if
he
would
sympathize
with
the
poor
dumb
beast
it
the
most
senseless
thing
in
the
world
this
docking
fashion
they
a
few
flimsy
arguments
about
a
horse
with
a
docked
tail
being
like
a
sheep
but
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
the
horse
was
made
strong
enough
to
do
the
work
he
got
to
do
and
man
ca
improve
on
him
docking
is
a
cruel
wicked
thing
now
there
a
ghost
of
an
argument
in
favor
of
on
certain
occasions
a
fiery
young
horse
ca
run
away
with
an
overdrawn
check
and
in
speeding
horses
a
tight
will
make
them
hold
their
heads
up
and
keep
them
from
choking
but
i
do
believe
in
raising
colts
in
a
way
to
make
them
fiery
and
i
wish
there
was
a
race
horse
on
the
face
of
the
earth
so
if
it
depended
on
me
every
kind
of
would
go
it
a
pity
we
women
ca
vote
laura
we
do
away
with
a
good
many
abuses
miss
laura
smiled
but
it
was
a
very
faint
almost
an
unhappy
smile
and
wood
said
hastily
let
us
talk
about
something
else
did
you
ever
hear
that
cows
will
give
less
milk
on
a
dark
day
than
on
a
bright
one
no
i
never
did
said
miss
laura
well
they
do
they
are
most
sensitive
animals
one
finds
out
all
manners
of
curious
things
about
animals
if
he
makes
a
study
of
them
cows
are
wonderful
creatures
i
think
and
so
grateful
for
good
usage
that
they
return
every
scrap
of
care
given
them
with
interest
have
you
ever
heard
anything
about
dehorning
laura
not
much
auntie
does
uncle
approve
of
it
no
indeed
he
just
as
soon
think
of
cutting
their
tails
off
as
of
dehorning
them
he
says
he
guesses
the
creator
knew
how
to
make
a
cow
better
than
he
does
sometimes
i
tell
john
that
his
argument
hold
good
for
a
man
in
some
ways
can
improve
on
nature
in
the
natural
course
of
things
a
cow
would
be
feeding
her
calf
for
half
a
year
but
we
take
it
away
from
her
and
raise
it
as
well
as
she
could
and
get
an
extra
quantity
of
milk
from
her
in
addition
i
do
know
what
to
think
myself
about
dehorning
windham
cattle
are
all
polled
and
he
has
an
open
space
in
his
barn
for
them
instead
of
keeping
them
in
stalls
and
he
says
they
more
comfortable
and
not
so
confined
i
suppose
in
sending
cattle
to
sea
it
necessary
to
take
their
horns
off
but
when
they
going
to
be
turned
out
to
grass
it
seems
like
mutilating
them
our
cows
could
keep
the
dogs
away
from
the
sheep
if
they
did
have
their
horns
their
horns
are
their
means
of
defense
do
your
cattle
stand
in
these
stalls
all
winter
asked
miss
laura
oh
yes
except
when
they
turned
out
in
the
barnyard
and
then
john
usually
has
to
send
a
man
to
keep
them
moving
or
they
take
cold
sometimes
on
very
fine
days
they
get
out
all
day
you
know
cows
like
horses
john
says
they
like
great
milk
machines
you
got
to
keep
them
quiet
only
exercising
enough
to
keep
them
in
health
if
a
cow
is
hurried
or
worried
or
chilled
or
heated
it
stops
her
milk
yield
and
bad
usage
poisons
it
john
says
you
ca
take
a
stick
and
strike
a
cow
across
the
back
without
her
milk
being
that
much
worse
and
as
for
drinking
the
milk
that
comes
from
a
cow
that
is
kept
clean
better
throw
it
away
and
drink
water
when
i
was
in
chicago
my
kept
complaining
to
her
milkman
about
what
she
called
the
smell
to
her
milk
the
animal
odor
he
said
it
ca
be
helped
all
milk
smells
like
that
dirt
i
said
when
she
asked
my
opinion
about
it
wager
my
best
bonnet
that
that
man
cows
are
kept
dirty
their
skins
are
plastered
up
with
filth
and
as
the
poison
in
them
ca
escape
that
way
it
coming
out
through
the
milk
and
you
helping
to
dispose
of
it
she
was
astonished
to
hear
this
and
she
got
her
milkman
address
and
one
day
dropped
in
upon
him
she
said
that
his
cows
were
standing
in
a
stable
that
was
comparatively
clean
but
that
their
bodies
were
in
just
the
state
that
i
described
them
as
living
in
she
advised
the
man
to
card
and
brush
his
cows
every
day
and
said
that
he
need
bring
her
no
more
milk
that
shows
how
you
city
people
are
imposed
upon
with
regard
to
your
milk
i
should
think
you
be
poisoned
with
the
treatment
your
cows
receive
and
even
when
your
milk
is
examined
you
ca
tell
whether
it
is
pure
or
not
in
new
york
the
law
only
requires
thirteen
per
cent
of
solids
in
milk
that
absurd
for
you
can
feed
a
cow
on
swill
and
still
get
fourteen
per
cent
of
solids
in
it
oh
you
city
people
are
queer
miss
laura
laughed
heartily
what
a
prejudice
you
have
against
large
towns
auntie
yes
i
have
said
wood
honestly
i
often
wish
we
could
break
up
a
few
of
our
cities
and
scatter
the
people
through
the
country
look
at
the
lovely
farms
all
about
here
some
of
them
with
only
an
old
man
and
woman
on
them
the
boys
are
off
to
the
cities
slaving
in
stores
and
offices
and
growing
pale
and
sickly
it
would
have
broken
my
heart
if
harry
had
taken
to
city
ways
i
had
a
plain
talk
with
your
uncle
when
i
married
him
and
said
my
boy
only
a
baby
and
i
want
him
to
be
brought
up
so
that
he
will
love
country
life
how
are
we
going
to
manage
it
your
uncle
looked
at
me
with
a
sly
twinkle
in
his
eye
and
said
i
was
a
pretty
fair
specimen
of
a
country
girl
suppose
we
brought
up
harry
the
way
i
been
brought
up
i
knew
he
was
only
joking
yet
i
got
quite
excited
i
said
as
my
father
and
mother
did
have
a
farm
about
twice
as
large
as
you
can
manage
do
keep
a
hired
man
get
up
at
daylight
and
slave
till
dark
never
take
a
holiday
have
the
girls
do
the
housework
and
take
care
of
the
hens
and
help
pick
the
fruit
and
make
the
boys
tend
the
colts
and
the
calves
and
put
all
the
money
they
make
in
the
bank
do
take
any
papers
for
they
would
waste
their
time
reading
them
and
it
too
far
to
go
the
postoffice
oftener
than
once
a
week
and
but
i
do
remember
the
rest
of
what
i
said
anyway
your
uncle
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
he
said
farm
too
big
i
going
to
sell
some
of
it
and
enjoy
myself
a
little
more
that
very
week
he
sold
fifty
acres
and
he
hired
an
extra
man
and
got
me
a
good
girl
and
twice
a
week
he
left
his
work
in
the
afternoon
and
took
me
for
a
drive
harry
held
the
reins
in
his
tiny
fingers
and
john
told
him
that
dolly
the
old
mare
we
were
driving
should
be
called
his
and
the
very
next
horse
he
bought
should
be
called
his
too
and
he
should
name
it
and
have
it
for
his
own
and
he
would
give
him
five
sheep
and
he
should
have
his
own
bank
book
and
keep
his
accounts
and
harry
understood
mere
baby
though
he
was
and
from
that
day
he
loved
john
as
his
own
father
if
my
father
had
had
the
wisdom
that
john
has
his
boys
would
be
the
one
a
poor
lawyer
and
the
other
a
poor
doctor
in
two
different
cities
and
our
farm
would
be
in
the
hands
of
strangers
it
makes
me
sick
to
go
there
i
think
of
my
poor
mother
lying
with
her
tired
hands
crossed
out
in
the
churchyard
and
the
boys
so
far
away
and
my
father
always
hurrying
and
driving
us
i
can
tell
you
laura
the
thing
cuts
both
ways
it
is
all
the
fault
of
the
boys
that
they
leave
the
country
wood
was
silent
for
a
little
while
after
she
made
this
long
speech
and
miss
laura
said
nothing
i
took
a
turn
or
two
up
and
down
the
stable
thinking
of
many
things
no
matter
how
happy
human
beings
seem
to
be
they
always
have
something
to
worry
them
i
was
sorry
for
wood
for
her
face
had
lost
the
happy
look
it
usually
wore
however
she
soon
forgot
her
trouble
and
said
now
i
must
go
and
get
the
tea
this
is
adele
afternoon
out
i
come
too
said
miss
laura
for
i
promised
her
i
make
the
biscuits
for
tea
this
evening
and
let
you
rest
they
both
sauntered
slowly
down
the
plank
walk
to
the
house
and
i
followed
them
chapter
xxxii
our
return
home
in
october
the
most
beautiful
of
all
the
months
we
were
obliged
to
go
back
to
fairport
miss
laura
could
not
bear
to
leave
the
farm
and
her
face
got
very
sorrowful
when
any
one
spoke
of
her
going
away
still
she
had
gotten
well
and
strong
and
was
as
brown
as
a
berry
and
she
said
that
she
knew
she
ought
to
go
home
and
get
back
to
her
lessons
wood
called
october
the
golden
month
everything
was
quiet
and
still
and
at
night
and
in
the
morning
the
sun
had
a
yellow
misty
look
the
trees
in
the
orchard
were
loaded
with
fruit
and
some
of
the
leaves
were
floating
down
making
a
soft
covering
on
the
ground
in
the
garden
there
were
a
great
many
flowers
in
bloom
in
flaming
red
and
yellow
colors
miss
laura
gathered
bunches
of
them
every
day
to
put
in
the
parlor
one
day
when
she
was
arranging
them
she
said
regretfully
they
will
soon
be
gone
i
wish
it
could
always
be
summer
you
would
get
tired
of
it
said
harry
who
had
come
up
softly
behind
her
there
only
one
place
where
we
could
stand
perpetual
summer
and
that
in
heaven
do
you
suppose
that
it
will
always
be
summer
there
said
miss
laura
turning
around
and
looking
at
him
i
do
know
i
imagine
it
will
be
but
i
do
think
anybody
knows
much
about
it
we
got
to
wait
miss
laura
eyes
fell
on
me
harry
she
said
do
you
think
that
dumb
animals
will
go
to
heaven
i
shall
have
to
say
again
i
do
know
he
replied
some
people
hold
that
they
do
in
a
michigan
paper
the
other
day
i
came
across
one
writer
opinion
on
the
subject
he
says
that
among
the
best
people
of
all
ages
have
been
some
who
believed
in
the
future
life
of
animals
homer
and
the
later
greeks
some
of
the
romans
and
early
christians
held
this
view
the
last
believing
that
god
sent
angels
in
the
shape
of
birds
to
comfort
sufferers
for
the
faith
francis
called
the
birds
and
beasts
his
brothers
johnson
believed
in
a
future
life
for
animals
as
also
did
wordsworth
shelley
coleridge
jeremy
taylor
agassiz
lamartine
and
many
christian
scholars
it
seems
as
if
they
ought
to
have
some
compensation
for
their
terrible
sufferings
in
this
world
then
to
go
to
heaven
animals
would
only
have
to
take
up
the
thread
of
their
lives
here
man
is
a
god
to
the
lower
creation
joe
worships
you
much
as
you
worship
your
maker
dumb
animals
live
in
and
for
their
masters
they
hang
on
our
words
and
looks
and
are
dependent
on
us
in
almost
every
way
for
my
own
part
and
looking
at
it
from
an
earthly
point
of
view
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
we
may
find
our
dumb
friends
in
paradise
and
in
the
bible
said
miss
laura
animals
are
often
spoken
of
the
dove
and
the
raven
the
wolf
and
the
lamb
and
the
leopard
and
the
cattle
that
god
says
are
his
and
the
little
sparrow
that
ca
fall
to
the
ground
without
our
father
knowing
it
still
there
nothing
definite
about
their
immortality
said
harry
however
we
got
nothing
to
do
with
that
if
it
right
for
them
to
be
in
heaven
we
find
them
there
all
we
have
to
do
now
is
to
deal
with
the
present
and
the
bible
plainly
tells
us
that
righteous
man
regardeth
the
life
of
his
beast
i
think
i
would
be
happier
in
heaven
if
dear
old
joe
were
there
said
miss
laura
looking
wistfully
at
me
he
has
been
such
a
good
dog
just
think
how
he
has
loved
and
protected
me
i
think
i
should
be
lonely
without
him
that
reminds
me
of
some
poetry
or
rather
doggerel
said
harry
that
i
cutout
of
a
newspaper
for
you
yesterday
and
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
little
slip
of
paper
and
read
this
do
doggies
gang
to
heaven
dad
will
oor
auld
donald
gang
for
noo
to
tak
him
faither
wi
us
wad
be
maist
awfu
wrang
there
was
a
number
of
other
verses
telling
how
many
kind
things
old
donald
the
dog
had
done
for
his
master
family
and
then
it
closed
with
these
lines
withoot
are
dogs
eh
faither
man
be
an
awfu
sin
to
leave
oor
faithfu
doggie
he
to
win
in
oor
donald
no
like
ither
dogs
he
be
lockit
oot
if
donald
no
let
into
heaven
i
no
gang
there
one
foot
my
sentiments
exactly
said
a
merry
voice
behind
miss
laura
and
harry
and
looking
up
they
saw
maxwell
he
was
holding
out
one
hand
to
them
and
in
the
other
kept
back
a
basket
of
large
pears
that
harry
promptly
took
from
him
and
offered
to
miss
laura
i
been
dependent
upon
animals
for
the
most
part
of
my
comfort
in
this
life
said
maxwell
and
i
be
happy
without
them
in
heaven
i
do
see
how
you
would
get
on
without
joe
miss
morris
and
i
want
my
birds
and
my
snake
and
my
horse
how
can
i
live
without
them
almost
all
my
life
here
if
some
animals
go
to
heaven
and
not
others
i
think
that
the
dog
has
the
first
claim
said
miss
laura
he
the
friend
of
man
the
oldest
and
best
have
you
ever
heard
the
legend
about
him
and
adam
no
said
maxwell
well
when
adam
was
turned
out
of
paradise
all
the
animals
shunned
him
and
he
sat
bitterly
weeping
with
his
head
between
his
hands
when
he
felt
the
soft
tongue
of
some
creature
gently
touching
him
he
took
his
hands
from
his
face
and
there
was
a
dog
that
had
separated
himself
from
all
the
other
animals
and
was
trying
to
comfort
him
he
became
the
chosen
friend
and
companion
of
adam
afterward
of
all
men
there
is
another
legend
said
harry
about
our
saviour
and
a
dog
have
you
ever
heard
it
we
tell
you
that
later
said
maxwell
when
we
know
what
it
is
harry
showed
his
white
teeth
in
an
amused
smile
and
began
once
upon
a
time
our
lord
was
going
through
a
town
with
his
disciples
a
dead
dog
lay
by
the
wayside
and
every
one
that
passed
along
flung
some
offensive
epithet
at
him
eastern
dogs
are
not
like
our
dogs
and
seemingly
there
was
nothing
good
about
this
loathsome
creature
but
as
our
saviour
went
by
he
said
gently
can
not
equal
the
whiteness
of
his
teeth
what
was
the
name
of
that
old
fellow
said
maxwell
abruptly
who
had
a
beautiful
swan
that
came
every
day
for
fifteen
years
to
bury
its
head
in
his
bosom
and
feed
from
his
hand
and
would
go
near
no
other
human
being
saint
hugh
of
lincoln
we
heard
about
him
at
the
band
of
mercy
the
other
day
said
miss
laura
i
should
think
that
he
would
have
wanted
to
have
that
swan
in
heaven
with
him
said
maxwell
what
a
beautiful
creature
it
must
have
been
speaking
about
animals
going
to
heaven
i
dare
say
some
of
them
would
object
to
going
on
account
of
the
company
that
they
would
meet
there
think
of
the
dog
kicked
to
death
by
his
master
the
horse
driven
into
his
grave
the
thousands
of
cattle
starved
to
death
on
the
plains
will
they
want
to
meet
their
owners
in
heaven
according
to
my
reckoning
their
owners
wo
be
there
said
harry
i
firmly
believe
that
the
lord
will
punish
every
man
or
woman
who
a
dumb
creature
just
as
surely
as
he
will
punish
those
who
their
if
a
man
life
has
been
a
long
series
of
cruelty
to
dumb
animals
do
you
suppose
that
he
would
enjoy
himself
in
heaven
which
will
be
full
of
kindness
to
every
one
not
he
he
rather
be
in
the
other
place
and
there
he
go
i
fully
believe
when
you
quite
disposed
of
all
your
and
the
dumb
creation
harry
perhaps
you
will
condescend
to
go
out
into
the
orchard
and
see
how
your
father
is
getting
on
with
picking
the
apples
said
wood
joining
miss
laura
and
the
two
young
men
her
eyes
twinkling
and
sparkling
with
amusement
the
apples
will
keep
mother
said
harry
putting
his
arm
around
her
i
just
came
in
for
a
moment
to
get
laura
come
maxwell
we
all
go
and
not
another
word
about
animals
wood
called
after
them
laura
will
go
crazy
some
day
through
thinking
of
their
sufferings
if
some
one
does
do
something
to
stop
her
miss
laura
turned
around
suddenly
dear
aunt
hattie
she
said
you
must
not
say
that
i
am
a
coward
i
know
about
hearing
of
pains
but
i
must
get
over
it
i
want
to
know
how
they
suffer
i
to
know
for
when
i
get
to
be
a
woman
i
am
going
to
do
all
i
can
to
help
them
and
i
join
you
said
maxwell
stretching
out
his
hand
to
miss
laura
she
did
not
smile
but
looking
very
earnestly
at
him
she
held
it
clasped
in
her
own
you
will
help
me
to
care
for
them
will
you
she
said
yes
i
promise
he
said
gravely
i
give
myself
to
the
service
of
dumb
animals
if
you
will
and
i
too
said
harry
in
his
deep
voice
laying
his
hand
across
theirs
wood
stood
looking
at
their
three
fresh
eager
young
faces
with
tears
in
her
eyes
just
as
they
all
stood
silently
for
an
instant
the
old
village
clergyman
came
into
the
room
from
the
hall
he
must
have
heard
what
they
said
for
before
they
could
move
he
had
laid
his
hands
on
their
three
brown
heads
bless
you
my
children
he
said
god
will
lift
up
the
light
of
his
countenance
upon
you
for
you
have
given
yourselves
to
a
noble
work
in
serving
dumb
creatures
you
are
ennobling
the
human
race
then
he
sat
down
in
a
chair
and
looked
at
them
he
was
a
venerable
old
man
and
had
long
white
hair
and
the
woods
thought
a
great
deal
of
him
he
had
come
to
get
wood
to
make
some
nourishing
dishes
for
a
sick
woman
in
the
village
and
while
he
was
talking
to
her
miss
laura
and
the
two
young
men
went
out
of
the
house
they
hurried
across
the
veranda
and
over
the
lawn
talking
and
laughing
and
enjoying
themselves
as
only
happy
young
people
can
and
with
not
a
trace
of
their
seriousness
of
a
few
moments
before
on
their
faces
they
were
going
so
fast
that
they
ran
right
into
a
flock
of
geese
that
were
coming
up
the
lane
they
were
driven
by
a
little
boy
called
tommy
the
son
of
one
of
wood
farm
laborers
and
they
were
chattering
and
gabbling
and
seemed
very
angry
what
all
this
about
said
harry
stopping
and
looking
at
the
boy
what
the
matter
with
your
feathered
charges
tommy
my
lad
if
it
the
geese
you
mean
said
the
boy
half
crying
and
looking
very
much
put
out
it
all
them
nasty
potatoes
they
wo
keep
away
from
them
so
the
potatoes
chase
the
geese
do
they
said
maxwell
teasingly
no
no
said
the
child
pettishly
wood
he
sets
me
to
watch
the
geese
and
they
runs
in
among
the
buckwheat
and
the
potatoes
and
i
tries
to
drive
them
out
and
they
does
want
to
come
and
shamefacedly
i
has
to
switch
their
feet
and
i
hates
to
do
it
i
a
band
of
mercy
boy
tommy
my
son
said
maxwell
solemnly
you
will
go
right
to
heaven
when
you
die
and
your
geese
will
go
with
you
hush
hush
said
miss
laura
do
tease
him
and
putting
her
arm
on
the
child
shoulder
she
said
you
are
a
good
boy
tommy
not
to
want
to
hurt
the
geese
let
me
see
your
switch
dear
he
showed
her
a
little
stick
he
had
in
his
hand
and
she
said
i
think
you
could
hurt
them
much
with
that
and
if
they
will
be
naughty
and
steal
the
potatoes
you
have
to
drive
them
out
take
some
of
my
pears
and
eat
them
and
you
will
forget
your
trouble
the
child
took
the
fruit
and
miss
laura
and
the
two
young
men
went
on
their
way
smiling
and
looking
over
their
shoulders
at
tommy
who
stood
in
the
lane
devouring
his
pears
and
keeping
one
eye
on
the
geese
that
had
gathered
a
little
in
front
of
him
and
were
gabbling
noisily
and
having
a
kind
of
indignation
meeting
because
they
had
been
driven
out
of
the
potato
field
tommy
father
and
mother
lived
in
a
little
house
down
near
the
road
wood
never
had
his
hired
men
live
in
his
own
house
he
had
two
small
houses
for
them
to
live
in
and
they
were
required
to
keep
them
as
neat
as
wood
own
house
was
kept
he
said
that
he
did
see
why
he
should
keep
a
boarding
house
if
he
was
a
farmer
nor
why
his
wife
should
wear
herself
out
waiting
on
strong
hearty
men
that
had
just
as
soon
take
care
of
themselves
he
wished
to
have
his
own
family
about
him
and
it
was
better
for
his
men
to
have
some
kind
of
family
life
for
themselves
if
one
of
his
men
was
unmarried
he
boarded
with
the
married
one
but
slept
in
his
own
house
on
this
october
day
we
found
wood
hard
at
work
under
the
fruit
trees
he
had
a
good
many
different
kind
of
apples
enormous
red
ones
and
long
yellow
ones
that
they
called
pippins
and
little
brown
ones
and
sweet
ones
and
bright
red
ones
and
others
more
than
i
could
mention
miss
laura
often
pared
one
and
cut
off
little
bits
for
me
for
i
always
wanted
to
eat
whatever
i
saw
her
eating
just
a
few
days
after
this
miss
laura
and
i
returned
to
fairport
and
some
of
wood
apples
traveled
along
with
us
for
he
sent
a
good
many
to
the
boston
market
and
wood
came
to
the
station
to
see
us
off
harry
could
not
come
for
he
had
left
riverdale
the
day
before
to
go
back
to
his
college
wood
said
that
she
would
be
very
lonely
without
her
two
young
people
and
she
kissed
miss
laura
over
and
over
again
and
made
her
promise
to
come
back
again
the
next
summer
i
was
put
in
a
box
in
the
express
car
and
wood
told
the
agent
that
if
he
knew
what
was
good
for
him
he
would
speak
to
me
occasionally
for
i
was
a
very
knowing
dog
and
if
he
did
treat
me
well
i
be
apt
to
write
him
up
in
the
newspapers
the
agent
laughed
and
quite
often
on
the
way
to
fairport
he
came
to
my
box
and
spoke
kindly
to
me
so
i
did
not
get
so
lonely
and
frightened
as
i
did
on
my
way
to
riverdale
how
glad
the
morrises
were
to
see
us
coming
back
the
boys
had
all
gotten
home
before
us
and
such
a
fuss
as
they
did
make
over
their
sister
they
loved
her
dearly
and
never
wanted
her
to
be
long
away
from
them
i
was
rubbed
and
stroked
and
had
to
run
about
offering
my
paw
to
every
one
jim
and
little
billy
licked
my
face
and
bella
croaked
out
glad
to
see
you
joe
had
a
good
time
how
your
health
we
soon
settled
down
for
the
winter
miss
laura
began
going
to
school
and
came
home
every
day
with
a
pile
of
books
under
her
arm
the
summer
in
the
country
had
done
her
so
much
good
that
her
mother
often
looked
at
her
fondly
and
said
the
child
she
sent
away
had
come
home
a
maid
chapter
xxxiii
performing
animals
a
week
or
two
after
we
got
home
i
heard
the
morris
boys
talking
about
an
italian
who
was
coming
to
fairport
with
a
troupe
of
trained
animals
and
i
could
see
for
myself
whenever
i
went
to
town
great
flaming
pictures
on
the
fences
of
monkeys
sitting
at
tables
dogs
and
ponies
and
goats
climbing
ladders
and
rolling
balls
and
doing
various
tricks
i
wondered
very
much
whether
they
would
be
able
to
do
all
those
extraordinary
things
but
it
turned
out
that
they
did
the
italian
name
was
bellini
and
one
afternoon
the
whole
morris
family
went
to
see
him
and
his
animals
and
when
they
came
home
i
heard
them
talking
about
it
i
wish
you
could
have
been
there
joe
said
jack
pulling
up
my
paws
to
rest
on
his
knees
now
listen
old
fellow
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
first
of
all
there
was
a
perfect
jam
in
the
town
hall
i
sat
up
in
front
with
a
lot
of
fellows
and
had
a
splendid
view
the
old
italian
came
out
dressed
in
his
best
suit
of
clothes
black
broadcloth
flower
in
his
buttonhole
and
so
on
he
made
a
fine
bow
and
he
said
he
was
too
see
ze
fine
audience
and
he
was
going
to
show
zem
ze
fine
animals
ze
finest
animals
in
ze
world
then
he
shook
a
little
whip
that
he
carried
in
his
hand
and
he
said
zat
whip
did
mean
zat
he
was
cruel
he
cracked
it
to
show
his
animals
when
to
begin
end
or
change
their
tricks
some
boy
yelled
you
do
whip
them
sometimes
and
the
old
man
made
another
bow
and
said
he
whipped
zem
just
as
ze
mammas
whip
ze
naughty
boys
to
make
zem
keep
still
when
zey
was
noisy
or
stubborn
then
everybody
laughed
at
the
boy
and
the
italian
said
the
performance
would
begin
by
a
grand
procession
of
all
the
animals
if
some
lady
would
kindly
step
up
to
the
piano
and
play
a
march
nina
smith
you
know
nina
joe
the
girl
that
has
black
eyes
and
wears
blue
ribbons
and
lives
around
the
corner
stepped
up
to
the
piano
and
banged
out
a
fine
loud
march
the
doors
at
the
side
of
the
platform
opened
and
out
came
the
animals
two
by
two
just
like
noah
ark
there
was
a
pony
with
a
monkey
walking
beside
it
and
holding
on
to
its
mane
another
monkey
on
a
pony
back
two
monkeys
hand
in
hand
a
dog
with
a
parrot
on
his
back
a
goat
harnessed
to
a
little
carriage
another
goat
carrying
a
birdcage
in
its
mouth
with
two
canaries
inside
different
kinds
of
cats
some
doves
and
pigeons
half
a
dozen
white
rats
with
red
harness
and
dragging
a
little
chariot
with
a
monkey
in
it
and
a
common
white
gander
that
came
in
last
of
all
and
did
nothing
but
follow
one
of
the
ponies
about
the
italian
spoke
of
the
gander
and
said
it
was
a
stupid
creature
and
could
learn
no
tricks
and
he
only
kept
it
on
account
of
its
affection
for
the
pony
he
had
got
them
both
on
a
vermont
farm
when
he
was
looking
for
show
animals
the
pony
master
had
made
a
pet
of
him
and
had
taught
him
to
come
whenever
he
whistled
for
him
though
the
pony
was
only
a
scrub
of
a
creature
he
had
a
gentle
disposition
and
every
other
animal
on
the
farm
liked
him
a
gander
in
particular
had
such
an
admiration
for
him
that
he
followed
him
wherever
he
went
and
if
he
lost
him
for
an
instant
he
would
mount
one
of
the
knolls
on
the
farm
and
stretch
out
his
neck
looking
for
him
when
he
caught
sight
of
him
he
gabbled
with
delight
and
running
to
him
waddled
up
and
down
beside
him
every
little
while
the
pony
put
his
nose
down
and
seemed
to
be
having
a
conversation
with
the
goose
if
the
farmer
whistled
for
the
pony
and
he
started
to
run
to
him
the
gander
knowing
he
could
not
keep
up
would
seize
the
pony
tail
in
his
beak
and
flapping
his
wings
would
get
along
as
fast
as
the
pony
did
and
the
pony
never
kicked
him
the
italian
saw
that
this
pony
would
be
a
good
one
to
train
for
the
stage
so
he
offered
the
farmer
a
large
price
for
him
and
took
him
away
oh
joe
i
forgot
to
say
that
by
this
time
all
the
animals
had
been
sent
off
the
stage
except
the
pony
and
the
gander
and
they
stood
looking
at
the
italian
while
he
talked
i
never
saw
anything
as
human
in
dumb
animals
as
that
pony
face
he
looked
as
if
he
understood
every
word
that
his
master
was
saying
after
this
story
was
over
the
italian
made
another
bow
and
then
told
the
pony
to
bow
he
nodded
his
head
at
the
people
and
they
all
laughed
then
the
italian
asked
him
to
favor
us
with
a
waltz
and
the
pony
got
up
on
his
hind
legs
and
danced
you
should
have
seen
that
gander
skirmishing
around
so
as
to
be
near
the
pony
and
yet
keep
out
of
the
way
of
his
heels
we
fellows
just
roared
and
we
would
have
kept
him
dancing
all
the
afternoon
if
the
italian
had
begged
young
gentlemen
not
to
make
ze
noise
but
let
ze
pony
do
ze
rest
of
his
tricks
pony
number
two
came
on
the
stage
and
it
was
too
queer
for
anything
to
see
the
things
the
two
of
them
did
they
helped
the
italian
on
with
his
coat
they
pulled
off
his
rubbers
they
took
his
coat
away
and
brought
him
a
chair
and
dragged
a
table
up
to
it
they
brought
him
letters
and
papers
and
rang
bells
and
rolled
barrels
and
swung
the
italian
in
a
big
swing
and
jumped
a
rope
and
walked
up
and
down
steps
they
just
went
around
that
stage
as
handy
with
their
teeth
as
two
boys
would
be
with
their
hands
and
they
seemed
to
understand
every
word
their
master
said
to
them
the
best
trick
of
all
was
telling
the
time
and
doing
questions
in
arithmetic
the
italian
pulled
his
watch
out
of
his
pocket
and
showed
it
to
the
first
pony
whose
name
was
diamond
and
said
time
is
it
the
pony
looked
at
it
then
scratched
four
times
with
his
forefoot
on
the
platform
the
italian
said
good
four
but
it
a
few
minutes
after
four
how
many
the
pony
scratched
again
five
times
the
italian
showed
his
watch
to
the
audience
and
said
that
it
was
just
five
minutes
past
four
then
he
asked
the
pony
how
old
he
was
he
scratched
four
times
that
meant
four
years
he
asked
him
how
many
days
in
a
week
there
were
how
many
months
in
a
year
and
he
gave
him
some
questions
in
addition
and
subtraction
and
the
pony
answered
them
all
correctly
of
course
the
italian
was
giving
him
some
sign
but
though
we
watched
him
closely
we
could
make
out
what
it
was
at
last
he
told
the
pony
that
he
had
been
very
good
and
had
done
his
lessons
well
if
it
would
rest
him
he
might
be
naughty
a
little
while
all
of
a
sudden
a
wicked
look
came
into
the
creature
eyes
he
turned
around
and
kicked
up
his
heels
at
his
master
he
pushed
over
the
table
and
chairs
and
knocked
down
a
blackboard
where
he
had
been
rubbing
out
figures
with
a
sponge
held
in
his
mouth
the
italian
pretended
to
be
cross
and
said
come
this
wo
do
and
he
called
the
other
pony
to
him
and
told
him
to
take
that
troublesome
fellow
off
the
stage
the
second
one
nosed
diamond
and
pushed
him
about
finally
bit
him
by
the
ear
and
led
him
squealing
off
the
stage
the
gander
followed
gabbling
as
fast
as
he
could
and
there
was
a
regular
roar
of
applause
after
that
there
were
ladders
brought
in
joe
and
dogs
came
on
not
thoroughbreds
but
curs
something
like
you
the
italian
says
he
teach
tricks
to
pedigree
animals
as
well
as
to
scrubs
those
dogs
jumped
the
ladders
and
climbed
them
and
went
through
them
and
did
all
kinds
of
things
the
man
cracked
his
whip
once
and
they
began
twice
and
they
did
backward
what
they
had
done
forward
three
times
and
they
stopped
and
every
animal
dogs
goats
ponies
and
monkeys
after
they
had
finished
their
tricks
ran
up
to
their
master
and
he
gave
them
a
lump
of
sugar
they
seemed
fond
of
him
and
often
when
they
performing
went
up
to
him
and
licked
his
hands
or
his
sleeve
there
was
one
boss
dog
joe
with
a
head
like
yours
bob
they
called
him
and
he
did
all
his
tricks
alone
the
italian
went
off
the
stage
and
the
dog
came
on
and
made
his
bow
and
climbed
his
ladders
and
jumped
his
hurdles
and
went
off
again
the
audience
howled
for
an
encore
and
did
he
come
out
alone
make
another
bow
and
retire
i
saw
old
judge
brown
wiping
the
tears
from
his
eyes
he
laughed
so
much
one
of
the
last
tricks
was
with
a
goat
and
the
italian
said
it
was
the
best
of
all
because
the
goat
is
such
a
hard
animal
to
teach
he
had
a
big
ball
and
the
goat
got
on
it
and
rolled
it
across
the
stage
without
getting
off
he
looked
as
nervous
as
a
cat
shaking
his
old
beard
and
trying
to
keep
his
four
hoofs
close
enough
together
to
keep
him
on
the
ball
we
had
a
funny
little
play
at
the
end
of
the
performance
a
monkey
dressed
as
a
lady
in
a
white
satin
suit
and
a
bonnet
with
a
white
veil
came
on
the
stage
she
was
miss
green
and
the
dog
bob
was
going
to
elope
with
her
he
was
all
rigged
out
as
smith
and
had
on
a
light
suit
of
clothes
and
a
tall
hat
on
the
side
of
his
head
high
collar
long
cuffs
and
he
carried
a
cane
he
was
a
regular
dude
he
stepped
up
to
miss
green
on
his
hind
legs
and
helped
her
on
to
a
pony
back
the
pony
galloped
off
the
stage
then
a
crowd
of
monkeys
chattering
and
wringing
their
hands
came
on
smith
had
run
away
with
their
child
they
were
all
dressed
up
too
there
were
the
father
and
mother
with
gray
wigs
and
black
clothes
and
the
young
greens
in
bibs
and
tuckers
they
were
a
crowd
while
they
were
going
on
in
this
way
the
pony
trotted
back
on
the
stage
and
they
all
flew
at
him
and
pulled
off
their
daughter
from
has
back
and
laughed
and
chattered
and
boxed
her
ears
and
took
off
her
white
veil
and
her
satin
dress
and
put
on
an
old
brown
thing
and
some
of
them
seized
the
dog
and
kicked
his
hat
and
broke
his
cane
and
stripped
his
clothes
off
and
threw
them
in
a
corner
and
bound
his
legs
with
cords
a
goat
came
on
harnessed
to
a
little
cart
and
they
threw
the
dog
in
it
and
wheeled
him
around
the
stage
a
few
times
then
they
took
him
out
and
tied
him
to
a
hook
in
the
wall
and
the
goat
ran
off
the
stage
and
the
monkeys
ran
to
one
side
and
one
of
them
pulled
out
a
little
revolver
pointed
it
at
the
dog
fired
and
he
dropped
down
as
if
he
was
dead
the
monkeys
stood
looking
at
him
and
then
there
was
the
most
awful
hullabaloo
you
ever
heard
such
a
barking
and
yelping
and
half
a
dozen
dogs
rushed
on
the
stage
and
did
they
trundle
those
monkeys
about
they
nosed
them
and
pushed
them
and
shook
them
till
they
all
ran
away
all
but
miss
green
who
sat
shivering
in
a
corner
after
a
while
she
crept
up
to
the
dead
dog
pawed
him
a
little
and
did
he
jump
up
as
much
alive
as
any
of
them
everybody
in
the
room
clapped
and
shouted
and
then
the
curtain
dropped
and
the
thing
was
over
i
wish
he
give
another
performance
early
in
the
morning
he
has
to
go
to
boston
jack
pushed
my
paws
from
his
knees
and
went
outdoors
and
i
began
to
think
that
i
would
very
much
like
to
see
those
performing
animals
it
was
not
yet
tea
time
and
i
would
have
plenty
of
time
to
take
a
run
down
to
the
hotel
where
they
were
staying
so
i
set
out
it
was
a
lovely
autumn
evening
the
sun
was
going
down
in
a
haze
and
it
was
quite
warm
earlier
in
the
day
i
had
heard
morris
say
that
this
was
our
indian
summer
and
that
we
should
soon
have
cold
weather
fairport
was
a
pretty
little
town
and
from
the
principal
street
one
could
look
out
upon
the
blue
water
of
the
bay
and
see
the
island
opposite
which
was
quite
deserted
now
for
all
the
summer
visitors
had
gone
home
and
the
island
house
was
shut
op
i
was
running
down
one
of
the
steep
side
streets
that
led
to
the
water
when
i
met
a
cart
coming
up
it
must
have
been
coming
from
one
of
the
vessels
for
it
was
full
of
boxes
and
packages
a
nervous
horse
was
drawing
it
and
he
was
straining
every
nerve
to
get
it
up
the
steep
hill
his
driver
was
a
burly
man
and
instead
of
letting
his
horse
stop
a
minute
to
rest
he
kept
urging
him
forward
the
poor
horse
kept
looking
at
his
master
his
eyes
almost
starting
from
his
head
in
terror
he
knew
that
the
whip
was
about
to
descend
on
his
quivering
body
and
so
it
did
and
there
was
no
one
by
to
interfere
no
one
but
a
woman
in
a
ragged
shawl
who
would
have
no
influence
with
the
driver
there
was
a
very
good
humane
society
in
fairport
and
none
of
the
teamsters
dared
their
horses
if
any
of
the
members
were
near
this
was
a
quiet
street
with
only
poor
houses
on
it
and
the
man
probably
knew
that
none
of
the
members
of
the
society
would
be
likely
to
be
living
in
them
he
whipped
his
horse
and
whipped
him
till
every
lash
made
my
heart
ache
and
if
i
had
dared
i
would
have
bitten
him
severely
suddenly
there
was
a
dull
thud
in
the
street
the
horse
had
fallen
down
the
driver
ran
to
his
head
but
he
was
quite
dead
thank
god
said
the
woman
bitterly
one
more
out
of
this
world
of
misery
then
she
turned
and
went
down
the
street
i
was
glad
for
the
horse
he
would
never
be
frightened
or
miserable
again
and
i
went
slowly
on
thinking
that
death
is
the
best
thing
that
can
happen
to
tortured
animals
the
fairport
hotel
was
built
right
in
the
centre
of
the
town
and
the
shops
and
houses
crowded
quite
close
about
it
it
was
a
high
brick
building
and
it
was
called
the
fairport
house
as
i
was
running
along
the
sidewalk
i
heard
some
one
speak
to
me
and
looking
up
i
saw
charlie
montague
i
had
heard
the
morrises
say
that
his
parents
were
staying
at
the
hotel
for
a
few
weeks
while
their
house
was
being
repaired
he
had
his
irish
setter
brisk
with
him
and
a
handsome
dog
he
was
as
he
stood
waving
his
silky
tail
in
the
sunlight
charlie
patted
me
and
then
he
and
his
dog
went
into
the
hotel
i
turned
into
the
stable
yard
it
was
a
small
place
and
as
i
picked
my
way
under
the
cabs
and
wagons
standing
in
the
yard
i
wondered
why
the
hotel
people
did
buy
some
of
the
old
houses
near
by
and
tear
them
down
and
make
a
stable
yard
worthy
of
such
a
nice
hotel
the
hotel
horses
were
just
getting
rubbed
down
after
their
day
work
and
others
were
coming
in
the
men
were
talking
and
laughing
and
there
was
no
sign
of
strange
animals
so
i
went
around
to
the
back
of
the
yard
here
they
were
in
an
empty
cow
stable
under
a
hay
loft
there
were
two
little
ponies
tied
up
in
a
stall
two
goats
beyond
them
and
dogs
and
monkeys
in
strong
traveling
cages
i
stood
in
the
doorway
and
stared
at
them
i
was
sorry
for
the
dogs
to
be
shut
up
on
such
a
lovely
evening
but
i
suppose
their
master
was
afraid
of
their
getting
lost
or
being
stolen
if
he
let
them
loose
they
all
seemed
very
friendly
the
ponies
turned
around
and
looked
at
me
with
their
gentle
eyes
and
then
went
on
munching
their
hay
i
wondered
very
much
where
the
gander
was
and
went
a
little
farther
into
the
stable
something
white
raised
itself
up
out
of
the
brownest
crib
and
there
was
the
gander
close
up
beside
the
open
mouth
of
his
friend
the
monkeys
make
a
jabbering
noise
and
held
on
to
the
bars
of
their
cage
with
their
little
black
hands
while
they
looked
out
at
me
the
dogs
sniffed
the
air
and
wagged
their
tails
and
tried
to
put
their
muzzles
through
the
bars
of
their
cage
i
liked
the
dogs
best
and
i
wanted
to
see
the
one
they
called
bob
so
i
went
up
quite
close
to
them
there
were
two
little
white
dogs
something
like
billy
two
mongrel
spaniels
an
irish
terrier
and
a
brown
dog
asleep
in
the
corner
that
i
knew
must
be
bob
he
did
look
a
little
like
me
but
he
was
not
quite
so
ugly
for
he
had
his
ears
and
his
tail
while
i
was
peering
through
the
bars
at
him
a
man
came
in
the
stable
he
noticed
me
the
first
thing
but
instead
of
driving
me
out
he
spoke
kindly
to
me
in
a
language
that
i
did
not
understand
so
i
knew
that
he
was
the
italian
how
glad
the
animals
were
to
see
him
the
gander
fluttered
out
of
his
nest
the
ponies
pulled
at
their
halters
the
dogs
whined
and
tried
to
reach
his
hands
to
lick
them
and
the
monkeys
chattered
with
delight
he
laughed
and
talked
back
to
them
in
queer
words
then
he
took
out
of
a
bag
on
his
arm
bones
for
the
dogs
nuts
and
cakes
for
the
monkeys
nice
juicy
carrots
for
the
ponies
some
green
stuff
for
the
goats
and
corn
for
the
gander
it
was
a
pretty
sight
to
see
the
old
man
feeding
his
pets
and
it
made
me
feel
quite
hungry
so
i
trotted
home
i
had
a
run
down
town
again
that
evening
with
morris
who
went
to
get
something
from
a
shop
for
his
wife
he
never
let
his
boys
go
to
town
after
tea
so
if
there
were
errands
to
be
done
he
or
morris
went
the
town
was
bright
and
lively
that
evening
and
a
great
many
people
were
walking
about
and
looking
into
the
shop
windows
when
we
came
home
i
went
into
the
kennel
with
jim
and
there
i
slept
till
the
middle
of
the
night
then
i
started
up
and
ran
outside
there
was
a
distant
bell
ringing
which
we
often
heard
in
fairport
and
which
always
meant
fire
chapter
xxxiv
a
fire
in
fairport
i
had
several
times
run
to
a
fire
with
the
boys
and
knew
that
there
was
always
a
great
noise
and
excitement
there
was
a
light
in
the
house
so
i
knew
that
somebody
was
getting
up
i
do
think
indeed
i
know
for
they
were
good
boys
that
they
ever
wanted
anybody
to
lose
property
but
they
did
enjoy
seeing
a
blaze
and
one
of
their
greatest
delights
when
there
had
been
a
fire
for
some
time
was
to
build
a
bonfire
in
the
garden
jim
and
i
ran
around
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
waited
in
a
few
minutes
some
one
came
rattling
at
the
front
door
and
i
was
sure
it
was
jack
but
it
was
morris
and
without
a
word
to
us
he
set
off
almost
running
toward
the
town
we
followed
after
him
and
as
we
hurried
along
other
men
ran
out
from
the
houses
along
the
streets
and
either
joined
him
or
dashed
ahead
they
seemed
to
have
dressed
in
a
hurry
and
were
thrusting
their
arms
in
their
coats
and
buttoning
themselves
up
as
they
went
some
of
them
had
hats
and
some
of
them
had
none
and
they
all
had
their
faces
toward
the
great
red
light
that
got
brighter
and
brighter
ahead
of
us
where
the
fire
they
shouted
to
each
other
know
afraid
it
the
hotel
or
the
town
hall
it
such
a
blaze
hope
not
how
the
water
supply
now
bad
time
for
a
fire
it
was
the
hotel
we
saw
that
as
soon
as
we
got
on
to
the
main
street
there
were
people
all
about
and
a
great
noise
and
confusion
and
smoke
and
blackness
and
up
above
bright
tongues
of
flame
were
leaping
against
the
sky
jim
and
i
kept
close
to
morris
heels
as
he
pushed
his
way
among
the
crowd
when
we
got
nearer
the
burning
building
we
saw
men
carrying
ladders
and
axes
and
others
were
shouting
directions
and
rushing
out
of
the
hotel
carrying
boxes
and
bundles
and
furniture
in
their
arms
from
the
windows
above
came
a
steady
stream
of
articles
thrown
among
the
crowd
a
mirror
struck
morris
on
the
arm
and
a
whole
package
of
clothes
fell
on
his
head
and
almost
smothered
him
but
he
brushed
them
aside
and
scarcely
noticed
them
there
was
something
the
matter
with
morris
i
knew
by
the
worried
sound
of
his
voice
when
he
spoke
to
any
one
i
could
not
see
his
face
though
it
was
as
light
as
day
about
us
for
we
had
got
jammed
in
the
crowd
and
if
i
had
not
kept
between
his
feet
i
should
have
been
trodden
to
death
jim
being
larger
than
i
was
had
got
separated
from
us
presently
morris
raised
his
voice
above
the
uproar
and
called
is
every
one
out
of
the
hotel
a
voice
shouted
back
i
going
up
to
see
it
jim
watson
the
fireman
cried
some
one
near
he
risking
his
life
to
go
into
that
pit
of
flame
do
go
watson
i
do
think
that
the
brave
fireman
paid
any
attention
to
this
warning
for
an
instant
later
the
same
voice
said
he
planting
his
ladder
against
the
third
story
he
bound
to
go
he
not
get
any
farther
than
the
second
anyway
where
are
the
montagues
shouted
morris
has
any
one
seen
the
montagues
morris
mr
morris
said
a
frightened
voices
and
young
charlie
montague
pressed
through
the
people
to
us
where
papa
i
do
know
where
did
you
leave
him
said
morris
taking
his
hand
and
drawing
him
closer
to
him
i
was
sleeping
in
his
room
said
the
boy
and
a
man
knocked
at
the
door
and
said
on
fire
five
minutes
to
dress
and
get
out
and
papa
told
me
to
put
on
my
clothes
and
go
downstairs
and
he
ran
up
to
mamma
where
was
she
asked
morris
quickly
on
the
fourth
flat
she
and
her
maid
blanche
were
up
there
you
know
mamma
has
been
well
and
could
sleep
and
our
room
was
so
noisy
that
she
moved
upstairs
where
it
was
quiet
morris
gave
a
kind
of
groan
oh
i
so
hot
and
there
such
a
dreadful
noise
said
the
little
boy
bursting
into
tears
and
i
want
mamma
morris
soothed
him
as
best
he
could
and
drew
him
a
little
to
the
edge
of
the
crowd
while
he
was
doing
this
there
was
a
piercing
cry
i
could
not
see
the
person
making
it
but
i
knew
it
was
the
italian
voice
he
was
screaming
in
broken
english
that
the
fire
was
spreading
to
the
stables
and
his
animals
would
be
burned
would
no
one
help
him
to
get
his
animals
out
there
was
a
great
deal
of
confused
language
some
voices
shouted
look
after
the
people
first
let
the
animals
go
and
others
said
for
shame
get
the
horses
out
but
no
one
seemed
to
do
anything
for
the
italian
went
on
crying
for
help
i
heard
a
number
of
people
who
were
standing
near
us
say
that
it
had
just
been
found
out
that
several
persons
who
had
been
sleeping
in
the
top
of
the
hotel
had
not
got
out
they
said
that
at
one
of
the
top
windows
a
poor
housemaid
was
shrieking
for
help
here
in
the
street
we
could
see
no
one
at
the
upper
windows
for
smoke
was
pouring
from
them
the
air
was
very
hot
and
heavy
and
i
did
wonder
that
charlie
montague
felt
ill
he
would
have
fallen
on
the
ground
if
morris
had
taken
him
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
out
of
the
crowd
he
put
him
down
on
the
brick
sidewalk
and
unfastened
his
little
shirt
and
left
me
to
watch
him
while
he
held
his
hands
under
a
leak
in
a
hose
that
was
fastened
to
a
hydrant
near
us
he
got
enough
water
to
dash
on
charlie
face
and
breast
and
then
seeing
that
the
boy
was
reviving
he
sat
down
on
the
curbstone
and
took
him
on
his
knee
charlie
lay
in
his
arms
and
moaned
he
was
a
delicate
boy
and
he
could
not
stand
rough
usage
as
the
morris
boys
could
morris
was
terribly
uneasy
his
face
was
deathly
white
and
he
shuddered
whenever
there
was
a
cry
from
the
burning
building
poor
souls
god
help
them
oh
this
is
awful
he
said
and
then
he
turned
his
eyes
from
the
great
sheets
of
flame
and
strained
the
little
boy
to
his
breast
at
last
there
were
wild
shrieks
that
i
knew
came
from
no
human
throats
the
fire
must
have
reached
the
horses
morris
sprang
up
then
sank
back
again
he
wanted
to
go
yet
he
could
be
of
no
use
there
were
hundreds
of
men
standing
about
but
the
fire
had
spread
so
rapidly
and
they
had
so
little
water
to
put
on
it
that
there
was
very
little
they
could
do
i
wondered
whether
i
could
do
anything
for
the
poor
animals
i
was
not
afraid
of
fire
as
most
dogs
for
one
of
the
tricks
that
the
morris
boys
had
taught
me
was
to
put
out
a
fire
with
my
paws
they
would
throw
a
piece
of
lighted
paper
on
the
floor
and
i
would
crush
it
with
my
forepaws
and
if
the
blaze
was
too
large
for
that
i
would
drag
a
bit
of
old
carpet
over
it
and
jump
on
it
i
left
mr
morris
and
ran
around
the
corner
of
the
street
to
the
back
of
the
hotel
it
was
not
burned
as
much
here
as
in
the
front
and
in
the
houses
all
around
people
were
out
on
their
roofs
with
wet
blankets
and
some
were
standing
at
the
windows
watching
the
fire
or
packing
up
their
belongings
ready
to
move
if
it
should
spread
to
them
there
was
a
narrow
lane
running
up
a
short
distance
toward
the
hotel
and
i
started
to
go
up
this
when
in
front
of
me
i
heard
such
a
wailing
piercing
noise
that
it
made
me
shudder
and
stand
still
the
italian
animals
were
going
to
be
burned
up
and
they
were
calling
to
their
master
to
come
and
let
them
out
their
voices
sounded
like
the
voices
of
children
in
mortal
pain
i
could
not
stand
it
i
was
seized
with
such
an
awful
horror
of
the
fire
that
i
turned
and
ran
feeling
so
thankful
that
i
was
not
in
it
as
i
got
into
the
street
i
stumbled
over
something
it
was
a
large
bird
a
parrot
and
at
first
i
thought
it
was
bella
then
i
remembered
hearing
jack
say
that
the
italian
had
a
parrot
it
was
not
dead
but
seemed
stupid
with
the
smoke
i
seized
it
in
my
mouth
and
ran
and
laid
it
at
morris
feet
he
wrapped
it
in
his
handkerchief
and
laid
it
beside
him
i
sat
and
trembled
and
did
not
leave
him
again
i
shall
never
forget
that
dreadful
night
it
seemed
as
if
we
were
there
for
hours
but
in
reality
it
was
only
a
short
time
the
hotel
soon
got
to
be
all
red
flames
and
there
was
very
little
smoke
the
inside
of
the
building
had
burned
away
and
nothing
more
could
be
gotten
out
the
firemen
and
all
the
people
drew
back
and
there
was
no
noise
everybody
stood
gazing
silently
at
the
flames
a
man
stepped
quietly
up
to
morris
and
looking
at
him
i
saw
that
it
was
montague
he
was
usually
a
man
with
a
kind
face
and
a
head
of
thick
hair
now
his
face
was
black
and
grimy
his
hair
was
burnt
from
the
front
of
his
head
and
his
clothes
were
half
torn
from
his
back
morris
sprang
up
when
he
saw
him
and
said
where
is
your
wife
the
gentleman
did
not
say
a
word
but
pointed
to
the
burning
building
impossible
cried
morris
is
there
no
mistake
your
beautiful
young
wife
montague
can
it
be
so
morris
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
it
is
true
said
montague
quietly
give
me
the
boy
charlie
had
fainted
again
and
his
father
took
him
in
his
arms
and
turned
away
montague
cried
morris
my
heart
is
sore
for
you
can
i
do
nothing
no
thank
you
said
the
gentleman
without
turning
around
but
there
was
more
anguish
in
his
voice
than
in
morris
and
though
i
am
only
a
dog
i
knew
that
his
heart
was
breaking
chapter
xxxv
billy
and
the
italian
morris
stayed
no
longer
he
followed
montague
along
the
sidewalk
a
little
way
and
then
exchanged
a
few
hurried
words
with
some
men
who
were
standing
near
and
hastened
home
through
streets
that
seemed
dark
and
dull
after
the
splendor
of
the
fire
though
it
was
still
the
middle
of
the
night
morris
was
up
and
dressed
and
waiting
for
him
she
opened
the
hall
door
with
one
hand
and
held
a
candle
in
the
other
i
felt
frightened
and
miserable
and
did
want
to
leave
morris
so
i
crept
in
after
him
do
make
a
noise
said
morris
laura
and
the
boys
are
sleeping
and
i
thought
it
better
not
to
wake
them
it
has
been
a
terrible
fire
has
it
was
it
the
hotel
morris
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
speak
to
me
william
said
morris
in
a
startled
tone
you
are
not
hurt
are
you
and
she
put
her
candle
on
the
table
and
came
and
sat
down
beside
him
he
dropped
his
hands
from
his
face
and
tears
were
running
down
his
cheeks
ten
lives
lost
he
said
among
them
mrs
montague
morris
looked
horrified
and
gave
a
little
cry
william
it
be
so
it
seemed
as
if
morris
could
not
sit
still
he
got
up
and
walked
to
and
fro
on
the
floor
it
was
an
awful
scene
margaret
i
never
wish
to
look
upon
the
like
again
do
you
remember
how
i
protested
against
the
building
of
that
deathtrap
look
at
the
wide
open
streets
around
it
and
yet
they
persisted
in
running
it
up
to
the
sky
god
will
require
an
account
of
those
deaths
at
the
hands
of
the
men
who
put
up
that
building
it
is
terrible
this
disregard
of
human
lives
to
think
of
that
delicate
woman
and
her
death
agony
he
threw
himself
in
a
chair
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
where
was
she
how
did
it
happen
was
her
husband
saved
and
charlie
said
morris
in
a
broken
voice
yes
charlie
and
montague
are
safe
charlie
will
recover
from
it
montague
life
is
done
you
know
his
love
for
his
wife
oh
margaret
when
will
men
cease
to
be
fools
what
does
the
lord
think
of
them
when
they
say
i
my
brother
keeper
and
the
other
poor
creatures
burned
to
death
their
lives
are
as
precious
in
his
sight
as
mrs
montague
morris
looked
so
weak
and
ill
that
morris
like
a
sensible
woman
questioned
him
no
further
but
made
a
fire
and
got
him
some
hot
tea
then
she
made
him
lie
down
on
the
sofa
and
she
sat
by
him
till
when
she
persuaded
him
to
go
to
bed
i
followed
her
about
and
kept
touching
her
dress
with
my
nose
it
seemed
so
good
to
me
to
have
this
pleasant
home
after
all
the
misery
i
had
seen
that
night
once
she
stopped
and
took
my
head
between
her
hands
dear
old
joe
she
said
tearfully
this
a
suffering
world
it
well
there
a
better
one
beyond
it
in
the
morning
the
boys
went
down
town
before
breakfast
and
learned
all
about
the
fire
it
started
in
the
top
story
of
the
hotel
in
the
room
of
some
fast
young
men
who
were
sitting
up
late
playing
cards
they
had
smuggled
wine
into
their
room
and
had
been
drinking
till
they
were
stupid
one
of
them
upset
the
lamp
and
when
the
flames
began
to
spread
so
that
they
could
not
extinguish
them
instead
of
rousing
some
one
near
them
they
rushed
downstairs
to
get
some
one
there
to
come
up
and
help
them
put
out
the
fire
when
they
returned
with
some
of
the
hotel
people
they
found
that
the
flames
had
spread
from
their
room
which
was
in
an
l
at
the
back
of
the
house
to
the
front
part
where
room
was
and
where
the
housemaids
belonging
to
the
hotel
slept
by
this
time
montague
had
gotten
upstairs
but
he
found
the
passageway
to
his
wife
room
so
full
of
flames
and
smoke
that
though
he
tried
again
and
again
to
force
his
way
through
he
could
not
he
disappeared
for
a
time
then
he
came
to
morris
and
got
his
boy
and
took
him
to
some
rooms
over
his
bank
and
shut
himself
up
with
him
for
some
days
he
would
let
no
one
in
then
he
came
out
with
the
look
of
an
old
man
on
his
face
and
his
hair
as
white
as
snow
and
went
out
to
his
beautiful
house
in
the
outskirts
of
the
town
nearly
all
the
horses
belonging
to
the
hotel
were
burned
a
few
were
gotten
out
by
having
blankets
put
over
their
heads
but
the
most
of
them
were
so
terrified
that
they
would
not
stir
the
morris
boys
said
that
they
found
the
old
italian
sitting
on
an
empty
box
looking
at
the
smoking
ruins
of
the
hotel
his
head
was
hanging
on
his
breast
and
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
his
ponies
were
burned
up
he
said
and
the
gander
and
the
monkeys
and
the
goats
and
his
wonderful
performing
dogs
he
had
only
his
birds
left
and
he
was
a
ruined
man
he
had
toiled
all
his
life
to
get
this
troupe
of
trained
animals
together
and
now
they
were
swept
from
him
it
was
cruel
and
wicked
and
he
wished
he
could
die
the
canaries
and
pigeons
and
doves
the
hotel
people
had
allowed
him
to
take
to
his
room
and
they
were
safe
the
parrot
was
lost
an
educated
parrot
that
could
answer
forty
questions
and
among
other
things
could
take
a
watch
and
tell
the
time
of
day
jack
morris
told
him
that
they
had
it
safe
at
home
and
that
it
was
very
much
alive
quarreling
furiously
with
his
parrot
bella
the
old
face
brightened
at
this
and
then
jack
and
carl
finding
that
he
had
had
no
breakfast
went
off
to
a
restaurant
near
by
and
got
him
some
steak
and
coffee
the
italian
was
very
grateful
and
as
he
ate
jack
said
the
tears
ran
into
his
coffee
cup
he
told
them
how
much
he
loved
his
animals
and
how
it
made
ze
heart
bitter
to
hear
zem
crying
to
him
to
deliver
zem
from
ze
raging
fire
the
boys
came
home
and
got
their
breakfast
and
went
to
school
miss
laura
did
not
go
out
she
sat
all
day
with
a
very
quiet
pained
face
she
could
neither
read
nor
sew
and
and
morris
were
just
as
unsettled
they
talked
about
the
fire
in
low
tones
and
i
could
see
that
they
felt
more
sad
about
montague
death
than
if
she
had
died
in
an
ordinary
way
her
dear
little
canary
barry
died
with
her
she
would
never
be
separated
from
him
and
his
cage
had
been
taken
up
to
the
top
of
the
hotel
with
her
he
probably
died
an
easier
death
than
his
poor
mistress
charley
dog
escaped
but
was
so
frightened
that
he
ran
out
to
their
house
outside
the
town
at
tea
time
morris
went
down
town
to
see
that
the
italian
got
a
comfortable
place
for
the
night
when
he
came
back
he
said
that
he
had
found
out
that
the
italian
was
by
no
means
so
old
a
man
as
he
looked
and
that
he
had
talked
to
him
about
raising
a
sum
of
money
for
him
among
the
fairport
people
till
he
had
become
quite
cheerful
and
said
that
if
morris
would
do
that
he
would
try
to
gather
another
troupe
of
animals
together
and
train
them
now
what
can
we
do
for
this
italian
asked
morris
we
give
him
much
money
but
we
might
let
him
have
one
or
two
of
our
pets
there
billy
he
a
bright
little
dog
and
not
two
years
old
yet
he
could
teach
him
anything
there
was
a
blank
silence
among
the
morris
children
billy
was
such
a
gentle
lovable
little
dog
that
he
was
a
favorite
with
every
one
in
the
house
i
suppose
we
ought
to
do
it
said
miss
laura
at
last
but
how
can
we
give
him
up
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
but
the
end
of
it
was
that
billy
was
given
to
the
italian
he
came
up
to
get
him
and
was
very
grateful
and
made
a
great
many
bows
holding
his
hat
in
his
hand
billy
took
to
him
at
once
and
the
italian
spoke
so
kindly
to
him
that
we
knew
he
would
have
a
good
master
morris
got
quite
a
large
sum
of
money
for
him
and
when
he
handed
it
to
him
the
poor
man
was
so
pleased
that
he
kissed
his
hand
and
promised
to
send
frequent
word
as
to
progress
and
welfare
chapter
xxxvi
dandy
the
tramp
about
a
week
after
billy
left
us
the
morris
family
much
to
its
surprise
became
the
owner
of
a
new
dog
he
walked
into
the
house
one
cold
wintry
afternoon
and
lay
calmly
down
by
the
fire
he
was
a
brindled
and
he
had
on
a
collar
with
dandy
engraved
on
it
he
lay
all
the
evening
by
the
fire
and
when
any
of
the
family
spoke
to
him
he
wagged
his
tail
and
looked
pleased
i
growled
a
little
at
him
at
first
but
he
never
cared
a
bit
and
just
dozed
off
to
sleep
so
i
soon
stopped
he
was
such
a
dog
that
the
morrises
were
afraid
that
some
one
had
lost
him
they
made
some
inquiries
the
next
day
and
found
that
he
belonged
to
a
new
york
gentleman
who
had
come
to
fairport
in
the
summer
in
a
yacht
this
dog
did
not
like
the
yacht
he
came
ashore
in
a
boat
whenever
he
got
a
chance
and
if
he
could
not
come
in
a
boat
he
would
swim
he
was
a
tramp
his
master
said
and
he
would
stay
long
in
any
place
the
morrises
were
so
amused
with
his
impudence
that
they
did
not
send
him
away
but
said
every
day
surely
he
will
be
gone
however
dandy
had
gotten
into
comfortable
quarters
and
he
had
no
intention
of
changing
them
for
a
while
at
least
then
he
was
very
handsome
and
had
such
a
pleasant
way
with
him
that
the
family
could
not
help
liking
him
i
never
cared
for
him
he
fawned
on
the
morrises
and
pretended
he
loved
them
and
afterward
turned
around
and
laughed
and
sneered
at
them
in
a
way
that
made
me
very
angry
i
used
to
lecture
him
sometimes
and
growl
about
him
to
jim
but
jim
always
said
let
him
alone
you
ca
do
him
any
good
he
was
born
bad
his
mother
good
he
tells
me
that
she
had
a
bad
name
among
all
the
dogs
in
her
neighborhood
she
was
a
thief
and
a
runaway
though
he
provoked
me
so
often
yet
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
some
of
his
stories
they
were
so
funny
we
were
lying
out
in
the
sun
on
the
platform
at
the
back
of
the
house
one
day
and
he
had
been
more
than
usually
provoking
so
i
got
up
to
leave
him
he
put
himself
in
my
way
however
and
said
coaxingly
do
be
cross
old
fellow
i
tell
you
some
stories
to
amuse
you
old
boy
what
shall
they
be
about
i
think
the
story
of
your
life
would
be
about
as
interesting
as
anything
you
could
make
up
i
said
dryly

and
they

why
did
they
cut

i
said
looking
at
his
long
slim
tail
which
was
like

the
fashion

a
ears

i
said
not
i
too
much
trouble
i
believe
in
taking
things
easy
i
should
think
you
did
i
said
scornfully
you
never
put
yourself
out
for
any
one
i
notice
but
speaking
of
cropping
ears
what
do
you
think
of
it
well
he
said
with
a
sly
glance
at
my
head
it
is
a
pleasant
operation
but
one
might
as
well
be
out
of
the
world
as
out
of
the
fashion
i
do
care
now
my
ears
are
done
but
i
said
think
of
the
poor
dogs
that
will
come
after
you
what
difference
does
that
make
to
me
he
said
i
be
dead
and
out
of
the
way
men
can
cut
off
their
ears
and
tails
and
legs
too
if
they
want
to
dandy
i
said
angrily
you
the
most
selfish
dog
that
i
ever
saw
do
excite
yourself
he
said
coolly
let
me
get
on
with
my
story
when
i
was
a
few
months
old
i
began
to
find
the
stable
yard
narrow
and
wondered
what
there
was
outside
of
it
i
discovered
a
hole
in
the
garden
wall
and
used
to
sneak
out
nights
oh
what
fun
it
was
i
got
to
know
a
lot
of
street
dogs
and
we
had
gay
times
barking
under
people
windows
and
making
them
mad
and
getting
into
back
yards
and
chasing
cats
we
used
to
kill
a
cat
nearly
every
night
policeman
would
chase
us
and
we
would
run
and
run
till
the
water
just
ran
off
our
tongues
and
we
a
bit
of
breath
left
then
i
go
home
and
sleep
all
day
and
go
out
again
the
next
night
when
i
was
about
a
year
old
i
began
to
stay
out
days
as
well
as
nights
they
could
keep
me
home
then
i
ran
away
for
three
months
i
got
with
an
old
lady
on
fifth
avenue
who
was
very
fond
of
dogs
she
had
four
white
poodles
and
her
servants
used
to
wash
them
and
tie
up
their
hair
with
blue
ribbons
and
she
used
to
take
them
for
drives
in
her
phaeton
in
the
park
and
they
wore
gold
and
silver
collars
the
biggest
poodle
wore
a
ruby
in
his
collar
worth
five
hundred
dollars
i
went
driving
too
and
sometimes
we
met
my
master
he
often
smiled
and
shook
his
head
at
me
i
heard
him
tell
the
coachman
one
day
that
i
was
a
little
blackguard
and
he
was
to
let
me
come
and
go
as
i
liked
if
they
had
whipped
you
soundly
i
said
it
might
have
made
a
good
dog
of
you
i
good
enough
now
said
dandy
airily
the
young
ladies
who
drove
with
my
master
used
to
say
that
it
was
priggish
and
tiresome
to
be
too
good
to
go
on
with
my
story
i
stayed
with
judge
tibbett
till
i
got
sick
of
her
fussy
ways
she
made
a
simpleton
of
herself
over
those
poodles
each
one
had
a
high
chair
at
the
table
and
a
plate
and
they
always
sat
in
these
chairs
and
had
meals
with
her
and
the
servants
all
called
them
master
bijou
and
master
tot
and
miss
tiny
and
miss
fluff
one
day
they
tried
to
make
me
sit
in
a
chair
and
i
got
cross
and
bit
tibbett
and
she
beat
me
cruelly
and
her
servants
stoned
me
away
from
the
house
speaking
about
fools
dandy
i
said
if
it
is
polite
to
call
a
lady
one
i
should
say
that
that
lady
was
one
dogs
should
be
put
out
of
their
place
why
did
she
have
some
poor
children
at
her
table
and
in
her
carriage
and
let
the
dogs
run
behind
easy
to
see
you
do
know
new
york
said
dandy
with
a
laugh
poor
children
do
live
with
rich
old
ladies
tibbett
hated
children
anyway
then
dogs
like
poodles
would
get
lost
in
the
mud
or
killed
in
the
crowd
if
they
ran
behind
a
carriage
only
knowing
dogs
like
me
can
make
their
way
about
i
rather
doubted
this
speech
but
i
said
nothing
and
he
went
on
patronizingly
however
joe
thou
hast
reason
as
the
french
say
judge
tibbett
give
her
dogs
exercise
enough
their
claws
were
as
long
as
chinamen
nails
and
the
hair
grew
over
their
pads
and
they
had
red
eyes
and
were
always
sick
and
she
had
to
dose
them
with
medicine
and
call
them
her
poor
little
doggies
bah
i
got
disgusted
with
her
when
i
left
her
i
ran
away
to
her
niece
miss
ball
she
was
a
sensible
young
lady
and
she
used
to
scold
her
aunt
for
the
way
in
which
she
brought
up
her
dogs
she
was
almost
too
sensible
for
her
pug
and
i
were
rubbed
and
scrubbed
within
an
inch
of
our
lives
and
had
to
go
for
such
long
walks
that
i
got
thoroughly
sick
of
them
a
woman
whom
the
servants
called
trotsey
came
every
morning
and
took
the
pug
and
me
by
our
chains
and
sometimes
another
dog
or
two
and
took
us
for
long
tramps
in
quiet
streets
that
was
trotsey
business
to
walk
dogs
and
miss
ball
got
a
great
many
fashionable
young
ladies
who
could
not
exercise
their
dogs
to
let
trotsey
have
them
and
they
said
that
it
made
a
great
difference
in
the
health
and
appearance
of
their
pets
trotsey
got
fifteen
cents
an
hour
for
a
dog
goodness
what
appetites
those
walks
gave
us
and
did
we
make
the
dog
biscuits
disappear
but
it
was
a
slow
life
at
miss
ball
we
only
saw
her
for
a
little
while
every
day
she
slept
till
noon
after
lunch
she
played
with
us
for
a
little
while
in
the
greenhouse
then
she
was
off
driving
or
visiting
and
in
the
evening
she
always
had
company
or
went
to
a
dance
or
to
the
theatre
i
soon
made
up
my
mind
that
i
run
away
i
jumped
out
of
a
window
one
fine
morning
and
ran
home
i
stayed
there
for
a
long
time
my
mother
had
been
run
over
by
a
cart
and
killed
and
i
was
sorry
my
master
never
bothered
his
head
about
me
and
i
could
do
as
i
liked
one
day
when
i
was
having
a
walk
and
meeting
a
lot
of
dogs
that
i
knew
a
little
boy
came
behind
me
and
before
i
could
tell
what
he
was
doing
he
had
snatched
me
up
and
was
running
off
with
me
i
could
bite
him
for
he
had
stuffed
some
of
his
rags
in
my
mouth
he
took
me
to
a
tenement
house
in
a
part
of
the
city
that
i
had
never
been
in
before
he
belonged
to
a
very
poor
family
my
faith
were
they
badly
off
six
children
and
a
mother
and
father
all
living
in
two
tiny
rooms
scarcely
a
bit
of
meat
did
i
smell
while
i
was
there
i
hated
their
bread
and
molasses
and
the
place
smelled
so
badly
that
i
thought
i
should
choke
they
kept
me
shut
up
in
their
dirty
rooms
for
several
days
and
the
brat
of
a
boy
that
caught
me
slept
with
his
arm
around
me
at
night
the
weather
was
hot
and
sometimes
we
could
sleep
and
they
had
to
go
up
on
the
roof
after
a
while
they
chained
me
up
in
a
filthy
yard
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
there
i
thought
i
should
go
mad
i
would
have
liked
to
bite
them
all
to
death
if
i
had
dared
it
awful
to
be
chained
especially
for
a
dog
like
me
that
loves
his
freedom
the
flies
worried
me
and
the
noises
distracted
me
and
my
flesh
would
fairly
creep
from
getting
no
exercise
i
was
there
nearly
a
month
while
they
were
waiting
for
a
reward
to
be
offered
but
none
came
and
one
day
the
boy
father
who
was
a
street
peddler
took
me
by
my
chain
and
led
me
about
the
streets
till
he
sold
me
a
gentleman
got
me
for
his
little
boy
but
i
did
like
the
look
of
him
so
i
sprang
up
and
bit
his
hand
and
he
dropped
the
chain
and
i
dodged
boys
and
policemen
and
finally
got
home
more
dead
than
alive
and
looking
like
a
skeleton
i
had
a
good
time
for
several
weeks
and
then
i
began
to
get
restless
and
was
off
again
but
i
getting
tired
i
want
to
go
to
sleep
you
not
very
polite
i
said
to
offer
to
tell
a
story
and
then
go
to
sleep
before
you
finish
it
look
out
for
number
one
my
boy
said
dandy
with
a
yawn
for
if
you
do
no
one
else
will
and
he
shut
his
eyes
and
was
fast
asleep
in
a
few
minutes
i
sat
and
looked
at
him
what
a
handsome
worthless
dog
he
was
a
few
days
later
he
told
me
the
rest
of
his
history
after
a
great
many
wanderings
he
happened
home
one
day
just
as
his
master
yacht
was
going
to
sail
and
they
chained
him
up
till
they
went
on
board
so
that
he
could
be
an
amusement
on
the
passage
to
fairport
it
was
in
november
that
dandy
came
to
us
and
he
stayed
all
winter
he
made
fun
of
the
morrises
all
the
time
and
said
they
had
a
dull
poky
old
house
and
he
only
stayed
because
miss
laura
was
nursing
him
he
had
a
little
sore
on
his
back
that
she
soon
found
out
was
mange
her
father
said
it
was
a
bad
disease
for
dogs
to
have
and
dandy
had
better
be
shot
but
she
begged
so
hard
for
his
life
and
said
she
would
cure
him
in
a
few
weeks
that
she
was
allowed
to
keep
him
dandy
was
capable
of
getting
really
angry
but
he
was
as
disturbed
about
having
this
disease
as
he
could
be
about
anything
he
said
that
he
had
got
it
from
a
little
mangy
dog
that
he
had
played
with
a
few
weeks
before
he
was
only
with
the
dog
a
little
while
and
did
think
he
would
take
it
but
it
seemed
he
knew
what
an
easy
thing
it
was
to
get
until
he
got
well
he
was
separated
from
us
miss
laura
kept
him
up
in
the
loft
with
the
rabbits
where
we
could
not
go
and
the
boys
ran
him
around
the
garden
for
exercise
she
tried
all
kind
of
cures
for
him
and
i
heard
her
say
that
though
it
was
a
skin
disease
his
blood
must
be
purified
she
gave
him
some
of
the
pills
that
she
made
out
of
sulphur
and
butter
for
jim
and
billy
and
me
to
keep
our
coats
silky
and
smooth
when
they
did
cure
him
she
gave
him
a
few
drops
of
arsenic
every
day
and
washed
the
sore
and
indeed
his
whole
body
with
tobacco
water
or
carbolic
soap
it
was
the
tobacco
water
that
cured
him
miss
laura
always
put
on
gloves
when
she
went
near
him
and
used
a
brush
to
wash
him
for
if
a
person
takes
mange
from
a
dog
they
may
lose
their
hair
and
their
eyelashes
but
if
they
are
careful
no
harm
comes
from
nursing
a
mangy
dog
and
i
have
never
known
of
any
one
taking
the
disease
after
a
time
dandy
sore
healed
and
he
was
set
free
he
was
right
glad
he
said
for
he
had
got
heartily
sick
of
the
rabbits
he
used
to
bark
at
them
and
make
them
angry
and
they
would
run
around
the
loft
stamping
their
hind
feet
at
him
in
the
funny
way
that
rabbits
do
i
think
they
disliked
him
as
much
as
he
disliked
them
jim
and
i
did
not
get
the
mange
dandy
was
not
a
strong
dog
and
i
think
his
irregular
way
of
living
made
him
take
diseases
readily
he
would
stuff
himself
when
he
was
hungry
and
he
always
wanted
rich
food
if
he
could
get
what
he
wanted
at
the
morrises
he
went
out
and
stole
or
visited
the
dumps
at
the
back
of
the
town
when
he
did
get
ill
he
was
more
stupid
about
doctoring
himself
than
any
dog
that
i
have
ever
seen
he
never
seemed
to
know
when
to
eat
grass
or
herbs
or
a
little
earth
that
would
have
kept
him
in
good
condition
a
dog
should
never
be
without
grass
when
dandy
got
ill
he
just
suffered
till
he
got
well
again
and
never
tried
to
cure
himself
of
his
small
troubles
some
dogs
even
know
enough
to
amputate
their
limbs
jim
told
me
a
very
interesting
story
of
a
dog
the
morrises
once
had
called
gyp
whose
leg
became
paralyzed
by
a
kick
from
a
horse
he
knew
the
leg
was
dead
and
gnawed
it
off
nearly
to
the
shoulder
and
though
he
was
very
sick
for
a
time
yet
in
the
end
he
got
well
to
return
to
dandy
i
knew
he
was
only
waiting
for
the
spring
to
leave
us
and
i
was
not
sorry
the
first
fine
day
he
was
off
and
during
the
rest
of
the
spring
and
summer
we
occasionally
met
him
running
about
the
town
with
a
set
of
fast
dogs
one
day
i
stopped
and
asked
him
how
he
contented
himself
in
such
a
quiet
place
as
fairport
and
he
said
he
was
dying
to
get
back
to
new
york
and
was
hoping
that
his
master
yacht
would
come
and
take
him
away
poor
dandy
never
left
fairport
after
all
he
was
not
such
a
bad
dog
there
was
nothing
really
vicious
about
him
and
i
hate
to
speak
of
his
end
his
master
yacht
did
not
come
and
soon
the
summer
was
over
and
the
winter
was
coming
and
no
one
wanted
dandy
for
he
had
such
a
bad
name
he
got
hungry
and
cold
and
one
day
sprang
upon
a
little
girl
to
take
away
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
that
she
was
eating
he
did
not
see
the
large
on
the
door
sill
and
before
he
could
get
away
the
dog
had
seized
him
and
bitten
and
shaken
him
till
he
was
nearly
dead
when
the
dog
threw
him
aside
he
crawled
to
the
morrises
and
miss
laura
bandaged
his
wounds
and
made
him
a
bed
in
the
stable
one
sunday
morning
she
washed
and
fed
him
very
tenderly
for
she
knew
he
could
not
live
much
longer
he
was
so
weak
that
he
could
scarcely
eat
the
food
that
she
put
in
his
mouth
so
she
let
him
lick
some
milk
from
her
finger
as
she
was
going
to
church
i
could
not
go
with
her
but
i
ran
down
the
lane
and
watched
her
out
of
sight
when
i
came
back
dandy
was
gone
i
looked
till
i
found
him
he
had
crawled
into
the
darkest
corner
of
the
stable
to
die
and
though
he
was
suffering
very
much
he
never
uttered
a
sound
i
sat
by
him
and
thought
of
his
master
in
new
york
if
he
had
brought
dandy
up
properly
he
might
not
now
be
here
in
his
silent
death
agony
a
young
pup
should
be
trained
just
as
a
child
is
and
punished
when
he
goes
wrong
dandy
began
badly
and
not
being
checked
in
his
evil
ways
had
come
to
this
poor
dandy
poor
handsome
dog
of
a
rich
master
he
opened
his
dull
eyes
gave
me
one
last
glance
then
with
a
convulsive
shudder
his
torn
limbs
were
still
he
would
never
suffer
any
more
when
miss
laura
came
home
she
cried
bitterly
to
know
that
he
was
dead
the
boys
took
him
away
from
her
and
made
him
a
grave
in
the
corner
of
the
garden
chapter
xxxvii
the
end
of
my
story
i
have
come
now
to
the
last
chapter
of
my
story
i
thought
when
i
began
to
write
that
i
would
put
down
the
events
of
each
year
of
my
life
but
i
fear
that
would
make
my
story
too
long
and
neither
miss
laura
nor
any
boys
and
girls
would
care
to
read
it
so
i
will
stop
just
here
though
i
would
gladly
go
on
for
i
have
enjoyed
so
much
talking
over
old
times
that
i
am
very
sorry
to
leave
off
every
year
that
i
have
been
at
the
morrises
something
pleasant
has
happened
to
me
but
i
can
not
put
all
these
things
down
nor
can
i
tell
how
miss
laura
and
the
boys
grew
and
changed
year
by
year
till
now
they
are
quite
grown
up
i
will
just
bring
my
tale
down
to
the
present
time
and
then
i
will
stop
talking
and
go
lie
down
in
my
basket
for
i
am
an
old
dog
now
and
get
tired
very
easily
i
was
a
year
old
when
i
went
to
the
morrises

i
have
been
with
them

says
that
she
hates

a
farmer
wife
but
she

i

that
she
must
be
mistaken

laura
we
are
great
friends
he
and
i
but
he
can
get
about
much
better
than
i
can
one
day
a
friend
of
miss
laura
came
with
a
little
boy
and
girl
and
collie
sat
between
the
two
children
and
their
father
took
their
picture
with
a
kodak
i
like
him
so
much
that
i
told
him
i
would
get
them
to
put
his
picture
in
my
book
when
the
morris
boys
are
all
here
in
the
summer
we
have
gay
times
all
through
the
winter
we
look
forward
to
their
coming
for
they
make
the
old
farmhouse
so
lively
maxwell
never
misses
a
summer
in
coming
to
riverdale
he
has
such
a
following
of
dumb
animals
now
that
he
says
he
ca
move
them
any
farther
away
from
boston
than
this
and
he
know
what
he
will
do
with
them
unless
he
sets
up
a
menagerie
he
asked
miss
laura
the
other
day
if
she
thought
that
the
old
italian
would
take
him
into
partnership
he
did
not
know
what
had
happened
to
poor
bellini
so
miss
laura
told
him
a
few
years
ago
the
italian
came
to
riverdale
to
exhibit
his
new
stock
of
performing
animals
they
were
almost
as
good
as
the
old
ones
but
he
had
not
quite
so
many
as
he
had
before
the
morrises
and
a
great
many
of
their
friends
went
to
his
performance
and
miss
laura
said
afterward
that
when
cunning
little
billy
came
on
the
stage
and
made
his
bow
and
went
through
his
antics
of
jumping
through
hoops
and
catching
balls
that
she
almost
had
hysterics
the
italian
had
made
a
special
pet
of
him
for
the
morrises
sake
and
treated
him
more
like
a
human
being
than
a
dog
billy
rather
put
on
airs
when
he
came
up
to
the
farm
to
see
us
but
he
was
such
a
dear
little
dog
in
spite
of
being
almost
spoiled
by
his
master
that
jim
and
i
could
not
get
angry
with
him
in
a
few
days
they
went
away
and
we
heard
nothing
but
good
news
from
them
till
last
winter
then
a
letter
came
to
miss
laura
from
a
nurse
in
a
new
york
hospital
she
said
that
the
italian
was
very
near
his
end
and
he
wanted
her
to
write
to
gray
to
tell
her
that
he
had
sold
all
his
animals
but
the
little
dog
that
she
had
so
kindly
given
him
he
was
sending
him
back
to
her
and
with
his
latest
breath
he
would
pray
for
blessing
on
the
kind
lady
and
her
family
that
had
befriended
him
when
he
was
in
trouble
the
next
day
billy
arrived
a
thin
white
scarecrow
of
a
dog
he
was
sick
and
unhappy
and
would
eat
nothing
and
started
up
at
the
slightest
sound
he
was
listening
for
the
italian
footsteps
but
he
never
came
and
one
day
harry
looked
up
from
his
newspaper
and
said
laura
bellini
is
dead
miss
laura
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
billy
who
had
jumped
up
when
he
heard
his
master
name
fell
back
again
he
knew
what
they
meant
and
from
that
instant
he
ceased
listening
for
footsteps
and
lay
quite
still
till
he
died
miss
laura
had
him
put
in
a
little
wooden
box
and
buried
him
in
a
corner
of
the
garden
and
when
she
is
working
among
her
flowers
she
often
speaks
regretfully
of
him
and
of
poor
dandy
who
lies
in
the
garden
at
fairport
bella
the
parrot
lives
with
morris
and
is
as
smart
as
ever
i
have
heard
that
parrots
live
to
a
very
great
age
some
of
them
even
get
to
be
a
hundred
years
old
if
that
is
the
case
bella
will
outlive
all
of
us
she
notices
that
i
am
getting
blind
and
feeble
and
when
i
go
down
to
call
on
morris
she
calls
out
to
me
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
beautiful
joe
never
say
die
beautiful
joe
keep
the
game
beautiful
joe
morris
says
that
she
does
know
where
bella
picks
up
her
slang
words
i
think
it
is
ned
who
teaches
her
for
when
he
comes
home
in
the
summer
he
often
says
with
a
sly
twinkle
in
his
eye
come
out
into
the
garden
bella
and
he
lies
in
a
hammock
under
the
trees
and
bella
perches
on
a
branch
near
him
and
he
talks
to
her
by
the
hour
anyway
it
is
in
the
autumn
after
he
leaves
riverdale
that
bella
always
shocks
morris
with
her
slang
talk
i
am
glad
that
i
am
to
end
my
days
in
riverdale
fairport
was
a
very
nice
place
but
it
was
not
open
and
free
like
this
farm
i
take
a
walk
every
morning
that
the
sun
shines
i
go
out
among
the
horses
and
cows
and
stop
to
watch
the
hens
pecking
at
their
food
this
is
a
happy
place
and
i
hope
my
dear
miss
laura
will
live
to
enjoy
it
many
years
after
i
am
gone
i
have
very
few
worries
the
pigs
bother
me
a
little
in
the
spring
by
rooting
up
the
bones
that
i
bury
in
the
fields
in
the
fall
but
that
is
a
small
matter
and
i
try
not
to
mind
it
i
get
a
great
many
bones
here
and
i
should
be
glad
if
i
had
some
poor
city
dogs
to
help
me
eat
them
i
do
think
bones
are
good
for
pigs
then
there
is
harry
tame
squirrel
out
in
one
of
the
barns
that
teases
me
considerably
he
knows
that
i
ca
chase
him
now
that
my
legs
are
so
stiff
with
rheumatism
and
he
takes
delight
in
showing
me
how
spry
he
can
be
darting
around
me
and
whisking
his
tail
almost
in
my
face
and
trying
to
get
me
to
run
after
him
so
that
he
can
laugh
at
me
i
do
think
that
he
is
a
very
thoughtful
squirrel
but
i
try
not
to
notice
him
the
sailor
boy
who
gave
bella
to
the
morrises
has
got
to
be
a
large
stout
man
and
is
the
first
mate
of
a
vessel
he
sometimes
comes
here
and
when
he
does
he
always
brings
the
morrises
presents
of
foreign
fruits
and
curiosities
of
different
kinds
malta
the
cat
is
still
living
and
is
with
morris
davy
the
rat
is
gone
so
is
poor
old
jim
he
went
away
one
day
last
summer
and
no
one
ever
knew
what
became
of
him
the
morrises
searched
everywhere
for
him
and
offered
a
large
reward
to
any
one
who
would
find
him
but
he
never
turned
up
again
i
think
that
he
felt
he
was
going
to
die
and
went
into
some
place
he
remembered
how
badly
miss
laura
felt
when
dandy
died
and
he
wanted
to
spare
her
the
greater
sorrow
of
his
death
he
was
always
such
a
thoughtful
dog
and
so
anxious
not
to
give
trouble
i
am
more
selfish
i
could
not
go
away
from
miss
laura
even
to
die
when
my
last
hour
comes
i
want
to
see
her
gentle
face
bending
over
me
and
then
i
shall
not
mind
how
much
i
suffer
she
is
just
as
as
ever
but
she
tries
not
to
feel
too
badly
about
the
sorrow
and
suffering
in
the
world
because
she
says
that
would
weaken
her
and
she
wants
all
her
strength
to
try
to
put
a
stop
to
some
of
it
she
does
a
great
deal
of
good
in
riverdale
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
one
in
all
the
country
around
who
is
as
much
beloved
as
she
is
she
has
never
forgotten
the
resolve
that
she
made
some
years
ago
that
she
would
do
all
that
she
could
to
protect
dumb
creatures
harry
and
maxwell
have
helped
her
nobly
maxwell
work
is
largely
done
in
boston
and
miss
laura
and
harry
have
to
do
the
most
of
theirs
by
writing
for
riverdale
has
got
to
be
a
model
village
in
respect
of
the
treatment
of
all
kinds
of
animals
it
is
a
model
village
not
only
in
that
respect
but
in
others
it
has
seemed
as
if
all
other
improvements
went
hand
in
hand
with
the
humane
treatment
of
animals
thoughtfulness
toward
lower
creatures
has
made
the
people
more
and
more
thoughtful
toward
themselves
and
this
little
town
is
getting
to
have
quite
a
name
through
the
state
for
its
good
schools
good
society
and
good
business
and
religious
standing
many
people
are
moving
into
it
to
educate
their
children
the
riverdale
people
are
very
particular
about
what
sort
of
strangers
come
to
live
among
them
a
man
who
came
here
two
years
ago
and
opened
a
shop
was
seen
kicking
a
small
kitten
out
of
his
house
the
next
day
a
committee
of
riverdale
citizens
waited
on
him
and
said
they
had
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
root
out
cruelty
from
their
village
and
they
did
want
any
one
to
come
there
and
introduce
it
again
and
they
thought
he
had
better
move
on
to
some
other
place
the
man
was
utterly
astonished
and
said
he
never
heard
of
such
particular
people
he
had
had
no
thought
of
being
cruel
he
did
think
that
the
kitten
cared
but
now
when
he
turned
the
thing
over
in
his
mind
he
did
suppose
cats
liked
being
kicked
about
any
more
than
he
would
like
it
himself
and
he
would
promise
to
be
kind
to
them
in
future
he
said
too
that
if
they
had
no
objection
he
would
just
stay
on
for
if
the
people
there
treated
dumb
animals
with
such
consideration
they
would
certainly
treat
human
beings
better
and
he
thought
it
would
be
a
good
place
to
bring
up
his
children
in
of
course
they
let
him
stay
and
he
is
now
a
man
who
is
celebrated
for
his
kindness
to
every
living
thing
and
he
never
refuses
to
help
miss
laura
when
she
goes
to
him
for
money
to
carry
out
any
of
her
humane
schemes
there
is
one
most
important
saying
of
miss
laura
that
comes
out
of
her
years
of
service
for
dumb
animals
that
i
must
put
in
before
i
close
and
it
is
this
she
says
that
cruel
and
vicious
owners
of
animals
should
be
punished
but
to
merely
thoughtless
people
do
say
do
so
much
do
go
to
them
and
say
do
overfeed
your
animals
and
do
starve
them
and
do
overwork
them
and
do
beat
them
and
so
on
through
the
long
list
of
hardships
that
can
be
put
upon
suffering
animals
but
say
simply
to
them
be
kind
make
a
study
of
your
animals
wants
and
see
that
they
are
satisfied
no
one
can
tell
you
how
to
treat
your
animal
as
well
as
you
should
know
yourself
for
you
are
with
it
all
the
time
and
know
its
disposition
and
just
how
much
work
it
can
stand
and
how
much
rest
and
food
it
needs
and
just
how
it
is
different
from
every
other
animal
if
it
is
sick
or
unhappy
you
are
the
one
to
take
care
of
it
for
nearly
every
animal
loves
its
own
master
better
than
a
stranger
and
will
get
well
quicker
under
his
care
miss
laura
says
that
if
men
and
women
are
kind
in
every
respect
to
their
dumb
servants
they
will
be
astonished
to
find
how
much
happiness
they
will
bring
into
their
lives
and
how
faithful
and
grateful
their
dumb
animals
will
be
to
them
now
i
must
really
close
my
story
to
the
boys
and
girls
who
may
read
it
and
if
it
is
not
wrong
for
a
dog
to
say
it
i
should
like
to
add
god
bless
you
all
if
in
my
feeble
way
i
have
been
able
to
impress
you
with
the
fact
that
dogs
and
many
other
animals
love
their
masters
and
mistresses
and
live
only
to
please
them
my
little
story
will
not
be
written
in
vain
my
last
words
are
boys
and
girls
be
kind
to
dumb
animals
not
only
because
you
will
lose
nothing
by
it
but
because
you
ought
to
for
they
were
placed
on
the
earth
by
the
same
kind
hand
that
made
all
living
creatures
