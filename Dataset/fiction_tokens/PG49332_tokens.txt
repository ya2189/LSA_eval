a
letter
to
the
translator
from
esq
june
my
dear
sir
in
a
visit
i
lately
paid
to
the
monastery
of
macarius
is
situated
as
you
know
in
the
valley
of
the
lakes
of
natron
was
lucky
enough
to
obtain
possession
of
a
curious
greek
manuscript
which
in
the
hope
that
you
may
be
induced
to
translate
it
i
herewith
send
you
observing
one
of
the
monks
very
busily
occupied
in
tearing
up
into
a
variety
of
fantastic
shapes
some
papers
which
had
the
appearance
of
being
the
leaves
of
old
books
i
enquired
of
him
the
meaning
of
his
task
and
received
the
following
explanation
the
arabs
it
seems
who
are
as
fond
of
pigeons
as
the
ancient
egyptians
have
a
superstitious
notion
that
if
they
place
in
their
small
scraps
of
paper
written
over
with
learned
characters
the
birds
are
always
sure
to
thrive
the
better
for
the
charm
and
the
monks
who
are
never
slow
in
profiting
by
superstition
have
at
all
times
a
supply
of
such
amulets
for
purchasers
in
general
the
holy
fathers
have
been
in
the
habit
of
scribbling
these
mystic
fragments
themselves
but
a
discovery
which
they
have
lately
made
saves
them
this
trouble
having
dug
up
as
my
informant
stated
a
chest
of
old
manuscripts
which
being
chiefly
on
the
subject
of
alchemy
must
have
been
buried
in
the
time
of
dioclesian
thought
we
could
not
added
the
monk
such
rubbish
more
properly
than
in
tearing
it
up
as
you
see
for
the
of
the
on
my
expressing
a
wish
to
rescue
some
part
of
these
treasures
from
the
fate
to
which
his
indolent
fraternity
had
consigned
them
he
produced
the
manuscript
which
i
have
now
the
pleasure
of
sending
you
only
one
he
said
remaining
entire
i
very
readily
paid
him
the
price
he
demanded
for
it
you
will
find
the
story
i
think
not
altogether
uninteresting
and
the
coincidence
in
many
respects
of
the
curious
details
in
chap
vi
with
the
description
of
the
same
ceremonies
in
the
romance
of
will
i
have
no
doubt
strike
you
hoping
that
you
may
be
tempted
to
give
a
translation
of
this
tale
to
the
world
i
am
my
dear
sir
very
truly
yours
the
epicurean
chapter
i
it
was
in
the
fourth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
late
emperor
valerian
that
the
followers
of
epicurus
who
were
at
that
time
numerous
in
athens
proceeded
to
the
election
of
a
person
to
fill
the
vacant
chair
of
their
sect
by
the
unanimous
voice
of
the
school
i
was
the
individual
chosen
for
their
chief
i
was
just
then
entering
on
my
year
and
no
instance
had
ever
before
occurred
of
a
person
so
young
being
selected
for
that
office
youth
however
and
the
personal
advantages
that
adorn
it
were
not
it
may
be
supposed
among
the
least
valid
recommendations
to
a
sect
that
included
within
its
circle
all
the
beauty
as
well
as
wit
of
athens
and
which
though
dignifying
its
pursuits
with
the
name
of
philosophy
was
little
else
than
a
pretext
for
the
more
refined
cultivation
of
pleasure
the
character
of
the
sect
had
indeed
much
changed
since
the
time
of
its
wise
and
virtuous
founder
who
while
he
asserted
that
pleasure
is
the
only
good
inculcated
also
that
good
is
the
only
source
of
pleasure
the
purer
part
of
this
doctrine
had
long
evaporated
and
the
temperate
epicurus
would
have
as
little
recognised
his
own
sect
in
the
assemblage
of
refined
voluptuaries
who
now
usurped
its
name
as
he
would
have
known
his
own
quiet
garden
in
the
luxurious
groves
and
bowers
among
which
the
meetings
of
the
school
were
now
held
many
causes
besides
the
attractiveness
of
its
doctrines
concurred
at
this
period
to
render
our
school
the
most
popular
of
any
that
still
survived
the
glory
of
greece
it
may
generally
be
observed
that
the
prevalence
in
one
half
of
a
community
of
very
rigid
notions
on
the
subject
of
religion
produces
the
opposite
extreme
of
laxity
and
infidelity
in
the
other
and
this
kind
of
it
was
that
now
mainly
contributed
to
render
the
doctrines
of
the
garden
the
most
fashionable
philosophy
of
the
day
the
rapid
progress
of
the
christian
faith
had
alarmed
all
those
who
either
from
piety
or
worldliness
were
interested
in
the
continuance
of
the
old
established
who
believed
in
the
deities
of
olympus
and
all
who
lived
by
them
the
consequence
was
a
considerable
increase
of
zeal
and
activity
throughout
the
constituted
authorities
and
priesthood
of
the
whole
heathen
world
what
was
wanting
in
sincerity
of
belief
was
made
up
in
rigour
weakest
parts
of
the
mythology
were
those
of
course
most
angrily
defended
and
any
reflections
tending
to
bring
saturn
or
his
wife
ops
into
contempt
were
punished
with
the
utmost
severity
of
the
law
in
this
state
of
affairs
between
the
alarmed
bigotry
of
the
declining
faith
and
the
simple
sublime
austerity
of
her
rival
it
was
not
wonderful
that
those
lovers
of
ease
and
pleasure
who
had
no
interest
reversionary
or
otherwise
in
the
old
religion
and
were
too
indolent
to
enquire
into
the
sanctions
of
the
new
should
take
refuge
from
the
severities
of
both
under
the
shelter
of
a
luxurious
philosophy
which
leaving
to
others
the
task
of
disputing
about
the
future
centered
all
its
wisdom
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
the
present
the
sectaries
of
the
garden
had
ever
since
the
death
of
their
founder
been
accustomed
to
dedicate
to
his
memory
the
twentieth
day
of
every
month
to
these
monthly
rites
had
for
some
time
been
added
a
grand
annual
festival
in
commemoration
of
his
birth
the
feasts
given
on
this
occasion
by
my
predecessors
in
the
chair
had
been
invariably
distinguished
for
their
taste
and
splendour
and
it
was
my
ambition
not
merely
to
imitate
this
example
but
even
to
render
the
anniversary
now
celebrated
under
my
auspices
so
brilliant
as
to
efface
the
recollection
of
all
that
went
before
it
seldom
indeed
had
athens
witnessed
such
a
scene
the
grounds
that
formed
the
original
site
of
the
garden
had
from
time
to
time
received
considerable
additions
and
the
whole
extent
was
laid
out
with
that
perfect
taste
which
knows
how
to
wed
nature
to
art
without
sacrificing
her
simplicity
to
the
alliance
walks
leading
through
wildernesses
of
shade
and
opening
as
if
to
afford
a
for
the
rising
on
the
very
spots
where
imagination
herself
would
have
called
them
up
and
fountains
and
lakes
in
alternate
motion
and
repose
either
wantonly
courting
the
verdure
or
calmly
sleeping
in
its
embrace
was
the
variety
of
feature
that
diversified
these
fair
gardens
and
animated
as
they
were
on
this
occasion
by
all
the
living
wit
and
loveliness
of
athens
it
afforded
a
scene
such
as
my
own
youthful
fancy
rich
as
it
was
then
in
images
of
luxury
and
beauty
could
hardly
have
anticipated
the
ceremonies
of
the
day
began
with
the
very
dawn
when
according
to
the
form
of
simpler
and
better
times
those
among
the
disciples
who
had
apartments
within
the
garden
bore
the
image
of
our
founder
in
procession
from
chamber
to
chamber
chanting
verses
in
praise
had
long
ceased
to
be
objects
of
our
frugality
and
temperance
round
a
beautiful
lake
in
the
centre
of
the
garden
stood
four
white
doric
temples
in
one
of
which
was
collected
a
library
containing
all
the
flowers
of
grecian
literature
while
in
the
remaining
three
conversation
the
song
and
the
dance
held
uninterrupted
by
each
other
their
respective
rites
in
the
library
stood
busts
of
all
the
most
illustrious
epicureans
both
of
rome
and
atticus
pliny
the
elder
the
poet
lucretius
lucian
and
the
biographer
of
the
philosophers
lately
lost
to
us
diogenes
laertius
there
were
also
the
portraits
in
marble
of
all
the
eminent
female
votaries
of
the
and
her
fair
daughter
danae
themista
philænis
and
others
it
was
here
that
in
my
capacity
of
heresiarch
on
the
morning
of
the
festival
i
received
the
felicitations
of
the
day
from
some
of
the
fairest
lips
of
athens
and
in
pronouncing
the
customary
oration
to
the
memory
of
our
master
in
which
it
was
usual
to
dwell
on
the
doctrines
he
inculcated
endeavoured
to
attain
that
art
so
useful
before
such
an
audience
of
diffusing
over
the
gravest
subjects
a
charm
which
secures
them
listeners
even
among
the
simplest
and
most
volatile
though
study
as
may
easily
be
supposed
engrossed
but
little
of
the
mornings
of
the
garden
yet
the
lighter
part
of
learning
portion
of
its
attic
honey
for
which
the
bee
is
not
obliged
to
go
very
deep
into
the
zealously
cultivated
even
here
however
the
student
had
to
encounter
distractions
which
are
of
all
others
least
favourable
to
composure
of
thought
and
with
more
than
one
of
my
fair
disciples
there
used
to
occur
such
scenes
as
the
following
which
a
poet
of
the
garden
taking
his
picture
from
the
life
described
the
lake
in
glow
that
temple
threw
its
lengthening
shade
upon
the
marble
steps
below
there
sate
a
fair
corinthian
maid
gracefully
some
volume
bending
while
by
her
side
the
youthful
sage
held
back
her
ringlets
lest
descending
they
should
all
the
but
it
was
for
the
evening
of
that
day
that
the
richest
of
our
luxuries
were
reserved
every
part
of
the
garden
was
illuminated
with
the
most
skilful
variety
of
lustre
while
over
the
lake
of
the
temples
were
scattered
wreaths
of
flowers
through
which
boats
filled
with
beautiful
children
floated
as
through
a
liquid
parterre
between
two
of
these
boats
a
perpetual
combat
was
maintained
respective
commanders
two
blooming
youths
being
habited
to
represent
eros
and
anteros
the
former
the
celestial
love
of
the
platonists
and
the
latter
that
more
earthly
spirit
which
usurps
the
name
of
love
among
the
epicureans
throughout
the
evening
their
conflict
was
carried
on
with
various
success
the
timid
distance
at
which
eros
kept
from
his
more
lively
antagonist
being
his
only
safeguard
against
those
darts
of
fire
with
showers
of
which
the
other
continually
assailed
him
but
which
luckily
falling
short
of
their
mark
upon
the
lake
only
scorched
the
flowers
upon
which
they
fell
and
were
extinguished
in
another
part
of
the
gardens
on
a
wide
verdant
glade
lighted
only
by
the
moon
an
imitation
of
the
of
the
panathenæa
was
performed
by
young
boys
chosen
for
their
fleetness
and
arrayed
with
wings
like
cupids
while
not
far
off
a
group
of
seven
nymphs
with
each
a
star
on
her
forehead
represented
the
movements
of
the
planetary
choir
and
embodied
the
dream
of
pythagoras
into
real
motion
and
song
at
every
turning
some
new
enchantment
broke
upon
the
ear
or
eye
sometimes
from
the
depth
of
a
grove
from
which
a
fountain
at
the
same
time
issued
there
came
a
strain
of
music
which
mingling
with
the
murmur
of
the
water
seemed
like
the
voice
of
the
spirit
that
presided
over
its
flow
sometimes
the
strain
rose
breathing
from
among
flowers
and
again
would
appear
to
come
suddenly
from
under
ground
as
if
the
foot
had
just
touched
some
spring
that
set
it
in
motion
it
seems
strange
that
i
should
now
dwell
upon
these
minute
descriptions
but
every
thing
connected
with
that
memorable
its
for
ever
live
sacredly
in
my
memory
the
festival
concluded
with
a
banquet
at
which
i
of
course
presided
and
feeling
myself
to
be
the
ascendant
spirit
of
the
whole
scene
gave
life
to
all
around
me
and
saw
my
own
happiness
reflected
in
that
of
others
chap
ii
the
festival
was
over
sounds
of
the
song
and
dance
had
ceased
and
i
was
now
left
in
those
luxurious
gardens
alone
though
so
ardent
and
active
a
votary
of
pleasure
i
had
by
nature
a
disposition
full
of
melancholy
imagination
that
presented
sad
thoughts
even
in
the
midst
of
mirth
and
happiness
and
threw
the
shadow
of
the
future
over
the
gayest
illusions
of
the
present
melancholy
was
indeed
in
my
soul
with
passion
and
not
even
in
the
fullest
fervour
of
the
latter
were
they
separated
from
the
first
moment
that
i
was
conscious
of
thought
and
feeling
the
same
dark
thread
had
run
across
the
web
and
images
of
death
and
annihilation
mingled
themselves
with
the
most
smiling
scenes
through
which
my
career
of
enjoyment
led
me
my
very
passion
for
pleasure
but
deepened
these
gloomy
fancies
for
shut
out
as
i
was
by
my
creed
from
a
future
life
and
having
no
hope
beyond
the
narrow
horizon
of
this
every
minute
of
delight
assumed
a
mournful
preciousness
in
my
eyes
and
pleasure
like
the
flower
of
the
cemetery
grew
but
more
luxuriant
from
the
neighbourhood
of
death
this
very
night
my
triumph
my
happiness
had
seemed
complete
i
had
been
the
presiding
genius
of
that
voluptuous
scene
both
my
ambition
and
my
love
of
pleasure
had
drunk
deep
of
the
cup
for
which
they
thirsted
looked
up
to
by
the
learned
and
loved
by
the
beautiful
and
the
young
i
had
seen
in
every
eye
that
met
mine
either
the
acknowledgment
of
triumphs
already
won
or
the
promise
of
others
still
brighter
that
awaited
me
yet
even
in
the
midst
of
all
this
the
same
dark
thoughts
had
presented
themselves
perishableness
of
myself
and
all
around
me
every
instant
recurred
to
my
mind
those
hands
i
had
eyes
in
which
i
had
seen
sparkling
a
spirit
of
light
and
life
that
should
never
voices
that
had
talked
of
eternal
all
i
felt
were
but
a
mockery
of
the
moment
and
would
leave
nothing
eternal
but
the
silence
of
their
dust
oh
were
it
not
for
this
sad
voice
stealing
amid
our
mirth
to
say
that
all
in
which
we
most
rejoice
ere
night
may
be
the
prey
for
this
full
as
the
world
is
with
bliss
and
capable
as
feels
my
soul
of
draining
to
its
depth
the
whole
i
should
turn
earth
to
heaven
and
be
if
bliss
made
gods
a
deity
such
was
the
description
i
gave
of
my
own
feelings
in
one
of
those
wild
passionate
songs
to
which
this
ferment
of
my
spirits
between
mirth
and
melancholy
gave
birth
seldom
had
my
heart
more
fully
abandoned
itself
to
such
vague
sadness
than
at
the
present
moment
when
as
i
paced
thoughtfully
among
the
fading
lights
and
flowers
of
the
banquet
the
echo
of
my
own
step
was
all
that
sounded
where
so
many
gay
forms
had
lately
been
revelling
the
moon
was
still
up
the
morning
had
not
yet
glimmered
and
the
calm
glories
of
night
still
rested
on
all
around
unconscious
whither
my
pathway
led
i
wandered
along
till
i
at
length
found
myself
before
that
fair
statue
of
venus
with
which
the
chisel
of
alcamenes
had
embellished
our
garden
image
of
deified
woman
the
only
idol
to
which
i
had
ever
bent
the
knee
leaning
against
the
pedestal
i
raised
my
eyes
to
heaven
and
fixing
them
sadly
and
intently
on
the
stars
as
if
i
sought
to
read
the
mournful
secret
in
their
light
asked
wherefore
was
it
that
man
alone
must
perish
while
they
less
wonderful
less
glorious
than
he
lived
on
in
light
unchangeable
and
for
ever
that
there
were
some
spell
some
talisman
i
exclaimed
make
the
spirit
within
us
deathless
as
those
stars
and
open
to
its
desires
a
career
like
theirs
burning
and
boundless
throughout
all
time
while
i
gave
myself
up
to
this
train
of
thought
that
lassitude
which
earthly
pleasure
however
sweet
leaves
behind
if
to
show
how
earthly
it
is
drowsily
over
me
and
i
sunk
at
the
base
of
the
statue
to
sleep
even
in
sleep
however
my
fancy
was
still
busy
and
a
dream
so
vivid
as
to
leave
behind
it
the
impression
of
reality
thus
passed
through
my
mind
i
thought
myself
transported
to
a
wide
desert
plain
where
nothing
seemed
to
breathe
or
move
or
live
the
very
sky
above
it
looked
pale
and
extinct
giving
the
idea
not
of
darkness
but
of
light
that
had
died
and
had
that
region
been
the
remains
of
some
older
world
left
broken
up
and
sunless
it
could
not
have
looked
more
dead
and
desolate
the
only
thing
that
bespoke
life
in
this
melancholy
waste
was
a
small
moving
spark
that
at
first
glimmered
in
the
distance
but
at
length
slowly
approached
the
spot
where
i
stood
as
it
drew
nearer
i
could
perceive
that
its
feeble
gleam
was
from
a
taper
in
the
hand
of
a
pale
venerable
man
who
now
stood
like
a
messenger
from
the
grave
before
me
after
a
few
moments
of
awful
silence
during
which
he
looked
at
me
with
a
sadness
that
thrilled
my
very
soul
he
said
who
seekest
eternal
life
go
unto
the
shores
of
the
dark
unto
the
shores
of
the
dark
nile
and
thou
wilt
find
the
eternal
life
thou
seekest
no
sooner
had
he
said
these
words
than
the
hue
of
his
cheek
brightened
into
a
smile
of
more
than
human
promise
the
small
torch
that
he
held
sent
forth
a
radiance
by
which
suddenly
the
whole
surface
of
the
desert
was
illuminated
even
to
the
far
edge
along
whose
line
were
now
seen
gardens
palaces
and
spires
all
bright
and
golden
like
the
architecture
of
the
clouds
at
sunset
sweet
music
too
was
heard
every
where
floating
around
and
from
all
sides
such
varieties
of
splendour
poured
that
with
the
excess
both
of
harmony
and
of
light
i
woke
that
infidels
should
be
superstitious
is
an
anomaly
neither
unusual
nor
strange
a
belief
in
superhuman
agency
seems
natural
and
necessary
to
the
mind
and
if
not
suffered
to
flow
in
the
obvious
channels
it
will
find
a
vent
in
some
other
hence
many
who
have
doubted
the
existence
of
a
god
have
yet
implicitly
placed
themselves
under
the
patronage
of
fate
or
the
stars
much
the
same
inconsistency
i
was
conscious
of
in
my
own
feelings
though
rejecting
all
belief
in
a
divine
providence
i
had
yet
a
faith
in
dreams
that
all
my
philosophy
could
not
conquer
nor
was
experience
wanting
to
confirm
me
in
my
delusion
for
by
some
of
those
accidental
coincidences
which
make
the
fortune
of
soothsayers
and
prophets
dreams
more
than
once
had
been
to
me
oracles
truer
far
than
oak
or
dove
or
tripod
ever
spoke
it
was
not
wonderful
therefore
that
the
vision
of
that
night
touching
as
it
did
a
chord
so
ready
to
vibrate
should
have
affected
me
with
more
than
ordinary
power
and
sunk
deeper
into
my
memory
with
every
effort
i
made
to
forget
it
in
vain
did
i
mock
at
my
own
weakness
derision
is
seldom
sincere
in
vain
did
i
pursue
my
accustomed
pleasures
their
zest
was
as
usual
for
ever
new
but
still
came
the
saddening
consciousness
of
mortality
and
with
it
the
recollection
of
this
visionary
promise
to
which
my
fancy
in
defiance
of
my
reason
still
clung
sometimes
indulging
in
reveries
that
were
little
else
than
a
continuation
of
my
dream
i
even
contemplated
the
possible
existence
of
some
secret
by
which
youth
might
be
if
not
perpetuated
at
least
prolonged
and
that
dreadful
vicinity
of
death
within
whose
circle
love
pines
and
pleasure
sickens
might
be
for
a
while
averted
knows
i
would
ask
that
in
egypt
that
land
of
wonders
where
mystery
hath
yet
unfolded
but
half
her
treasures
so
many
dark
secrets
of
the
antediluvian
world
still
remain
undeciphered
upon
the
pillars
of
knows
but
some
charm
some
amulet
may
lie
hid
whose
discovery
as
this
phantom
hath
promised
but
waits
my
compound
of
the
same
pure
atoms
that
scintillate
in
the
eternal
stars
and
whose
infusion
into
the
frame
of
man
might
make
him
too
fadeless
and
immortal
thus
did
i
fondly
speculate
in
those
rambling
moods
when
the
life
of
excitement
which
i
led
acting
upon
a
warm
heart
and
vivid
fancy
produced
an
intoxication
of
spirit
during
which
i
was
not
wholly
myself
this
bewilderment
too
was
not
a
little
increased
by
the
constant
struggle
between
my
own
natural
feelings
and
the
cold
mortal
creed
of
my
sect
in
endeavouring
to
escape
from
whose
deadening
bondage
i
but
broke
loose
into
the
realms
of
romance
and
fantasy
even
however
in
my
calmest
and
soberest
moments
that
strange
vision
perpetually
haunted
me
in
vain
were
all
my
efforts
to
chase
it
from
my
mind
and
the
deliberate
conclusion
to
which
i
came
at
last
was
that
without
at
least
a
visit
to
egypt
i
could
not
rest
nor
till
convinced
of
my
folly
by
disappointment
be
reasonable
i
therefore
announced
without
delay
to
my
associates
of
the
garden
the
intention
which
i
had
formed
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
land
of
pyramids
to
none
of
them
did
i
dare
to
confess
the
vague
visionary
impulse
that
actuated
me
knowledge
was
the
object
that
i
alleged
while
pleasure
was
that
for
which
they
gave
me
credit
the
interests
of
the
school
it
was
apprehended
would
suffer
by
my
absence
and
there
were
some
tenderer
ties
which
had
still
more
to
fear
from
separation
but
for
the
former
inconvenience
a
temporary
remedy
was
provided
while
the
latter
a
skilful
distribution
of
vows
and
sighs
alleviated
being
furnished
with
recommendatory
letters
to
all
parts
of
egypt
in
the
summer
of
the
year
i
set
sail
for
alexandria
chap
iii
to
one
who
extracted
such
sweets
from
every
moment
on
land
a
however
smooth
and
favourable
appeared
the
least
agreeable
mode
of
losing
time
that
could
be
devised
often
did
my
imagination
in
passing
some
isle
of
those
seas
people
it
with
fair
forms
and
kind
hearts
to
whom
most
willingly
if
i
might
would
i
have
paused
to
pay
homage
but
the
wind
blew
direct
towards
the
land
of
mystery
and
still
more
i
heard
a
voice
within
me
whispering
for
ever
as
we
approached
the
coast
of
egypt
our
course
became
less
prosperous
and
we
had
a
specimen
of
the
benevolence
of
the
divinities
of
the
nile
in
the
shape
of
a
storm
or
rather
whirlwind
which
had
nearly
sunk
our
vessel
and
which
the
egyptians
on
board
said
was
the
work
of
their
god
typhon
after
a
day
and
night
of
danger
during
which
we
were
driven
out
of
our
course
to
the
eastward
some
benigner
influence
prevailed
above
and
at
length
as
the
morning
freshly
broke
we
saw
the
beautiful
city
of
alexandria
rising
from
the
sea
with
its
palace
of
kings
its
portico
of
four
hundred
columns
and
the
fair
pillar
of
pillars
towering
up
to
heaven
in
the
midst
after
passing
in
review
this
splendid
vision
we
shot
rapidly
round
the
rock
of
pharos
and
in
a
few
minutes
found
ourselves
in
the
harbour
of
eunostus
the
sun
had
risen
but
the
light
on
the
great
tower
of
the
rock
was
still
burning
and
there
was
a
languor
in
the
first
waking
movements
of
that
voluptuous
houses
and
temples
lay
shining
in
silence
round
the
sufficiently
attested
the
festivities
of
the
preceding
night
we
were
soon
landed
on
the
quay
and
as
i
walked
through
a
line
of
palaces
and
shrines
up
the
street
which
leads
from
the
sea
to
the
gate
of
canopus
fresh
as
i
was
from
the
contemplation
of
my
own
lovely
athens
i
felt
a
glow
of
admiration
at
the
scene
around
me
which
its
novelty
even
more
than
its
magnificence
inspired
nor
were
the
luxuries
and
delights
which
such
a
city
promised
among
the
least
of
the
considerations
on
which
my
fancy
at
that
moment
dwelt
on
the
contrary
every
thing
around
seemed
prophetic
of
future
pleasure
the
very
forms
of
the
architecture
to
my
epicurean
imagination
appeared
to
call
up
images
of
living
grace
and
even
the
dim
seclusion
of
the
temples
and
groves
spoke
only
of
tender
mysteries
to
my
mind
as
the
whole
bright
scene
grew
animated
around
me
i
felt
that
though
egypt
might
not
enable
me
to
lengthen
life
she
could
teach
the
next
best
art
of
multiplying
its
enjoyments
the
population
of
alexandria
at
this
period
consisted
of
the
most
motley
miscellany
of
nations
religions
and
sects
that
had
ever
been
brought
together
in
one
city
beside
the
school
of
the
grecian
platonist
was
seen
the
oratory
of
the
cabalistic
jew
while
the
church
of
the
christian
stood
undisturbed
over
the
crypts
of
the
egyptian
hierophant
here
the
adorer
of
fire
from
the
east
laughed
at
the
superstition
of
the
worshipper
of
cats
from
the
west
here
christianity
too
unluckily
had
learned
to
emulate
the
vagaries
of
paganism
and
while
on
one
side
her
ophite
professor
was
seen
kneeling
down
gravely
before
his
serpent
on
the
other
a
nicosian
was
as
gravely
contending
that
there
was
no
chance
of
salvation
out
of
the
pale
of
the
greek
alphabet
still
worse
the
uncharitableness
of
christian
schism
was
already
distinguishing
itself
with
equal
vigour
and
i
heard
of
nothing
on
my
arrival
but
the
rancour
and
hate
with
which
the
greek
and
latin
churchmen
persecuted
each
other
because
forsooth
the
one
fasted
on
the
seventh
day
of
the
week
and
the
others
fasted
upon
the
fourth
and
sixth
to
none
of
those
religions
or
sects
however
except
for
purposes
of
ridicule
did
i
pay
much
attention
i
was
now
in
the
most
luxurious
city
of
the
universe
and
gave
way
without
reserve
to
the
seductions
that
surrounded
me
my
reputation
as
a
philosopher
and
a
man
of
pleasure
had
preceded
me
and
alexandria
the
second
athens
of
the
world
welcomed
me
as
her
own
my
celebrity
indeed
was
as
a
talisman
that
opened
hearts
and
doors
at
my
approach
the
usual
noviciate
of
acquaintance
was
dispensed
with
in
my
favour
and
not
only
intimacies
but
loves
and
friendships
ripened
in
my
path
as
rapidly
as
vegetation
springs
up
where
the
nile
has
flowed
the
dark
beauty
of
the
egyptian
women
had
a
novelty
in
my
eyes
that
enhanced
its
other
charms
and
that
hue
of
the
sun
on
their
rounded
cheeks
was
but
an
earnest
of
the
ardour
he
had
kindled
in
their
imbrowning
of
the
fruit
that
tells
how
rich
within
the
soul
of
sweetness
dwells
some
weeks
rolled
on
in
such
perpetual
and
pleasures
that
even
the
melancholy
voice
in
my
heart
though
it
still
spoke
was
but
seldom
listened
to
and
soon
died
away
in
the
sound
of
the
siren
songs
that
surrounded
me
at
length
however
as
the
novelty
of
these
scenes
wore
off
the
same
gloomy
bodings
began
to
mingle
with
all
my
joys
and
an
incident
that
occurred
during
one
of
my
gayest
revels
conduced
still
more
to
deepen
their
gloom
the
celebration
of
the
annual
festival
of
serapis
took
place
during
my
stay
and
i
was
more
than
once
induced
to
mingle
with
the
gay
multitudes
that
crowded
to
his
shrine
at
canopus
on
the
occasion
day
and
night
while
this
festival
lasted
the
canal
which
led
from
alexandria
to
canopus
was
covered
with
boats
full
of
pilgrims
of
both
sexes
all
hastening
to
avail
themselves
of
this
pious
licence
which
lent
the
zest
of
a
religious
sanction
to
pleasure
and
gave
a
holiday
to
the
passions
of
earth
in
honour
of
heaven
i
was
returning
one
lovely
night
to
alexandria
the
north
wind
that
welcome
visitor
freshened
the
air
while
the
banks
on
either
side
sent
forth
from
groves
of
orange
and
henna
the
most
delicious
odours
as
i
had
left
all
the
crowd
behind
me
at
canopus
there
was
not
a
boat
to
be
seen
on
the
canal
but
my
own
and
i
was
just
yielding
to
the
thoughts
which
solitude
at
such
an
hour
inspires
when
my
reveries
were
broken
by
the
sound
of
some
female
voices
coming
mingled
with
laughter
and
screams
from
the
garden
of
a
pavilion
that
stood
brilliantly
illuminated
upon
the
bank
of
the
canal
on
rowing
nearer
i
perceived
that
both
the
mirth
and
the
alarm
had
been
caused
by
the
efforts
of
some
playful
girls
to
reach
a
hedge
of
jasmin
which
grew
near
the
water
and
in
bending
towards
which
they
had
nearly
fallen
into
the
stream
hastening
to
proffer
my
assistance
i
soon
recognised
the
voice
of
one
of
my
fair
alexandrian
friends
and
springing
on
the
bank
was
surrounded
by
the
whole
group
who
insisted
on
my
joining
their
party
in
the
pavilion
and
flinging
the
tendrils
of
jasmin
which
they
had
just
plucked
around
me
led
me
no
unwilling
captive
to
the
i
found
here
an
assemblage
of
the
very
flower
of
alexandrian
society
the
unexpectedness
of
the
meeting
gave
it
an
additional
zest
on
both
sides
and
seldom
had
i
felt
more
enlivened
myself
or
contributed
more
successfully
to
circulate
life
among
others
among
the
company
were
some
greek
women
who
according
to
the
fashion
of
their
country
wore
veils
but
as
usual
rather
to
set
off
than
conceal
their
beauty
some
gleams
of
which
were
continually
escaping
from
under
the
cloud
there
was
however
one
female
who
particularly
attracted
my
attention
on
whose
head
was
a
chaplet
of
flowers
and
who
sat
veiled
and
silent
during
the
whole
of
the
banquet
she
took
no
share
i
observed
in
what
was
passing
around
the
viands
and
the
wine
went
by
her
untouched
nor
did
a
word
that
was
spoken
seem
addressed
to
her
ear
this
abstraction
from
a
scene
so
sparkling
with
gaiety
though
apparently
unnoticed
by
any
one
but
myself
struck
me
as
mysterious
and
strange
i
inquired
of
my
fair
neighbour
the
cause
of
it
but
she
looked
grave
and
was
silent
in
the
mean
time
the
lyre
and
the
cup
went
round
and
a
young
maid
from
athens
as
if
inspired
by
the
presence
of
her
countryman
took
her
lute
and
sung
to
it
some
of
the
songs
of
greece
with
a
feeling
that
bore
me
back
to
the
banks
of
the
ilissus
and
even
in
the
bosom
of
present
pleasure
drew
a
sigh
from
my
heart
for
that
which
had
passed
away
it
was
daybreak
ere
our
delighted
party
rose
and
unwillingly
to
return
to
the
city
scarcely
were
we
afloat
when
it
was
discovered
that
the
lute
of
the
young
athenian
had
been
left
behind
and
with
my
heart
still
full
of
its
sweet
sounds
i
most
readily
sprung
on
shore
to
seek
it
i
hastened
to
the
which
was
now
dim
and
solitary
except
to
my
astonishment
still
sat
that
silent
figure
which
had
awakened
my
curiosity
so
strongly
during
the
night
a
vague
feeling
of
awe
came
over
me
as
i
now
slowly
approached
it
there
was
no
motion
no
sound
of
breathing
in
that
form
a
leaf
of
the
dark
chaplet
on
its
brow
stirred
by
the
light
of
a
dying
lamp
which
stood
before
the
figure
i
raised
with
a
hesitating
hand
the
veil
and
my
fancy
had
already
the
shape
underneath
was
lifeless
was
a
skeleton
startled
and
shocked
i
hurried
back
with
the
lute
to
the
boat
and
was
almost
as
silent
as
that
shape
for
the
remainder
of
the
voyage
this
custom
among
the
egyptians
of
placing
a
mummy
or
skeleton
at
the
had
been
for
some
time
disused
except
at
particular
ceremonies
and
even
on
such
occasions
it
had
been
the
practice
of
the
luxurious
alexandrians
to
disguise
this
memorial
of
mortality
in
the
manner
just
described
but
to
me
who
was
wholly
unprepared
for
such
a
spectacle
it
gave
a
shock
from
which
my
imagination
did
not
speedily
recover
this
silent
and
ghastly
witness
of
mirth
seemed
to
embody
as
it
were
the
shadow
in
my
own
heart
the
features
of
the
grave
were
now
stamped
on
the
idea
that
haunted
me
and
this
picture
of
what
i
to
mingled
itself
with
the
sunniest
aspect
of
what
i
the
memory
of
the
dream
now
recurred
to
me
more
livelily
than
ever
the
bright
assuring
smile
of
that
venerable
spirit
and
his
words
to
the
shores
of
the
dark
nile
and
thou
wilt
find
the
eternal
life
thou
seekest
were
for
ever
before
my
mind
but
as
yet
alas
i
had
done
nothing
towards
realising
this
splendid
promise
alexandria
was
not
egypt
very
soil
on
which
it
stood
was
not
in
existence
when
thebes
and
memphis
already
counted
ages
of
glory
is
beneath
the
pyramids
of
memphis
i
exclaimed
in
the
mystic
halls
of
the
labyrinth
that
i
must
seek
those
holy
arcana
of
science
of
which
the
antediluvian
world
has
made
egypt
its
heir
and
among
thought
key
to
eternal
life
may
having
formed
my
determination
i
took
leave
of
my
many
alexandrian
friends
and
departed
for
memphis
chap
iv
egypt
was
the
country
of
all
others
from
that
mixture
of
the
melancholy
and
the
voluptuous
which
marked
the
character
of
her
people
her
religion
and
her
scenery
to
affect
deeply
a
temperament
and
fancy
like
mine
and
keep
tremblingly
alive
the
sensibilities
of
both
wherever
i
turned
i
saw
the
desert
and
the
garden
mingling
their
bloom
and
desolation
together
i
saw
the
and
the
tomb
standing
side
by
side
and
pleasure
and
death
keeping
hourly
watch
upon
each
other
in
the
very
luxury
of
the
climate
there
was
the
same
saddening
influence
the
monotonous
splendour
of
the
days
the
solemn
radiance
of
the
tended
to
cherish
that
ardent
melancholy
the
offspring
of
passion
and
of
thought
which
had
so
long
been
the
inmate
of
my
soul
when
i
sailed
from
alexandria
the
inundation
of
the
nile
was
at
its
full
the
whole
valley
of
egypt
lay
covered
by
its
flood
and
as
i
saw
around
me
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
shrines
palaces
and
monuments
encircled
by
the
waters
i
could
almost
fancy
that
i
beheld
the
sinking
island
of
atalantis
on
the
last
evening
its
temples
were
visible
above
the
wave
such
varieties
too
of
animation
as
presented
themselves
on
every
side
while
far
as
sight
can
reach
beneath
as
clear
and
blue
a
heaven
as
ever
this
sphere
gardens
and
streets
and
porphyry
domes
and
temples
fit
to
be
the
homes
of
mighty
gods
and
pyramids
whose
hour
outlasts
all
time
above
the
waters
tower
then
too
the
scenes
of
pomp
and
joy
that
make
one
theatre
of
this
vast
peopled
lake
where
all
that
love
religion
commerce
gives
of
life
and
motion
ever
moves
and
lives
here
up
the
steps
of
temples
from
the
wave
ascending
in
procession
slow
and
grave
priests
in
white
garments
go
with
sacred
wands
and
silver
cymbals
gleaming
in
their
hands
while
there
rich
from
those
sunny
tracts
far
off
beyond
the
sounding
glide
with
their
precious
lading
to
the
sea
plumes
of
bright
birds
ivory
gems
from
the
isle
of
meröe
and
those
grains
of
gold
down
by
abyssinian
rains
here
where
the
waters
wind
into
a
bay
shadowy
and
cool
some
pilgrims
on
their
way
to
saïs
or
bubastus
among
beds
of
that
close
above
their
heads
push
their
light
barks
and
hid
as
in
a
bower
sing
talk
or
sleep
away
the
sultry
hour
while
haply
not
far
off
beneath
a
bank
of
blossoming
acacias
many
a
prank
is
in
the
cool
current
by
a
train
of
laughing
nymphs
lovely
as
she
whose
chain
around
two
conquerors
of
the
world
was
cast
but
for
a
third
too
feeble
broke
at
last
enchanted
with
the
whole
scene
i
lingered
on
my
voyage
visiting
all
those
luxurious
and
venerable
places
whose
names
have
been
consecrated
by
the
wonder
of
ages
at
saïs
i
was
present
during
her
festival
of
lamps
and
read
by
the
blaze
of
innumerable
lights
those
sublime
words
on
the
temple
of
neitha
am
all
that
has
been
that
is
and
that
will
be
and
no
man
hath
ever
lifted
my
i
wandered
among
the
prostrate
obelisks
of
heliopolis
and
saw
not
without
a
sigh
the
sun
smiling
over
her
ruins
as
if
in
mockery
of
the
mass
of
perishable
grandeur
that
had
once
called
itself
in
its
pride
city
of
the
but
to
the
isle
of
the
golden
venus
was
my
fondest
pilgrimage
as
i
explored
its
shades
where
bowers
are
the
only
temples
i
felt
how
far
more
fit
to
form
the
shrine
of
a
deity
are
the
stems
of
the
garden
and
the
grove
than
the
most
precious
columns
that
the
inanimate
quarry
can
supply
every
where
new
pleasures
new
interests
awaited
me
and
though
melancholy
as
usual
stood
always
near
her
shadow
fell
but
over
my
vagrant
path
and
left
the
rest
more
welcomely
brilliant
from
the
contrast
to
relate
my
various
adventures
during
this
short
voyage
would
only
detain
me
from
events
far
far
more
worthy
of
record
amidst
such
endless
variety
of
attractions
the
great
object
of
my
journey
was
forgotten
mysteries
of
this
land
of
the
sun
were
to
me
as
much
mysteries
as
ever
and
i
had
as
yet
been
initiated
in
nothing
but
its
pleasures
it
was
not
till
that
evening
when
i
first
stood
before
the
pyramids
of
memphis
and
saw
them
towering
aloft
like
the
of
time
from
whose
summit
when
he
expires
he
will
look
his
last
was
not
till
this
moment
that
the
great
secret
of
which
i
had
dreamed
again
rose
in
all
its
inscrutable
darkness
upon
my
thoughts
there
was
a
solemnity
in
the
sunshine
that
rested
upon
those
stillness
as
of
reverence
in
the
air
around
them
that
stole
like
the
music
of
past
times
into
my
heart
i
thought
what
myriads
of
the
wise
the
beautiful
and
the
brave
had
sunk
into
dust
since
earth
first
beheld
those
wonders
and
in
the
sadness
of
my
soul
i
exclaimed
man
alone
then
perish
must
minds
and
hearts
be
annihilated
while
pyramids
endure
death
death
even
on
these
everlasting
tablets
only
approach
to
immortality
that
kings
themselves
could
purchase
hast
written
our
doom
saying
awfully
and
intelligibly
is
for
man
no
eternal
mansion
but
the
tomb
my
heart
sunk
at
the
thought
and
for
the
moment
i
yielded
to
that
desolate
feeling
which
overspreads
the
soul
that
hath
no
light
from
the
future
but
again
the
buoyancy
of
my
nature
prevailed
and
again
the
willing
dupe
of
vain
dreams
i
deluded
myself
into
the
belief
of
all
that
i
most
wished
with
that
happy
facility
which
makes
imagination
stand
in
place
of
happiness
i
cried
be
within
reach
and
as
wisdom
alone
is
worthy
of
such
a
blessing
to
the
wise
alone
must
the
secret
have
been
revealed
deep
it
is
said
under
yonder
pyramid
has
for
ages
lain
concealed
the
table
of
emerald
on
which
the
hermes
engraved
before
the
flood
the
secret
of
alchemy
that
gives
gold
at
will
why
may
not
the
mightier
the
more
secret
that
gives
life
at
will
be
recorded
there
also
it
was
by
the
power
of
gold
of
endless
gold
that
the
kings
who
repose
in
those
massy
structures
scooped
earth
to
the
centre
and
raised
quarries
into
the
air
to
provide
themselves
with
tombs
that
might
outstand
the
world
who
can
tell
but
that
the
gift
of
immortality
was
also
theirs
who
knows
but
that
they
themselves
triumphant
over
decay
still
mansions
which
we
call
tombs
being
rich
and
everlasting
palaces
within
whose
depths
concealed
from
this
withering
world
they
still
wander
with
the
few
who
are
sharers
of
their
gift
through
a
sunless
but
illuminated
elysium
of
their
own
else
wherefore
those
structures
wherefore
that
subterraneous
realm
by
which
the
whole
valley
of
egypt
is
undermined
why
else
those
labyrinths
which
none
of
earth
hath
ever
none
of
heaven
except
that
god
with
the
finger
on
his
hushed
lip
hath
trodden
while
i
indulged
in
these
dreams
the
sun
half
sunk
beneath
the
horizon
was
taking
calmly
and
gloriously
his
leave
of
the
pyramids
he
had
done
evening
after
evening
for
ages
till
they
had
become
familiar
to
him
as
the
earth
itself
on
the
side
turned
to
his
ray
they
now
presented
a
front
of
dazzling
whiteness
while
on
the
other
their
great
shadows
lengthening
to
the
eastward
looked
like
the
first
steps
of
night
hastening
to
envelope
the
hills
of
araby
in
her
shade
no
sooner
had
the
last
gleam
of
the
sun
disappeared
than
on
every
top
in
memphis
gay
gilded
banners
were
seen
waving
aloft
to
proclaim
his
setting
a
full
burst
of
harmony
pealed
from
all
the
temples
along
the
shores
startled
from
my
musing
by
these
sounds
i
at
once
recollected
that
on
that
very
evening
the
great
festival
of
the
moon
was
to
be
celebrated
on
a
little
island
over
between
the
gardens
of
memphis
and
the
eastern
shore
stood
the
temple
of
that
goddess
whose
beams
bring
the
sweet
time
of
and
dreams
the
cold
dian
of
the
north
who
chains
in
vestal
ice
the
current
of
young
veins
but
she
who
haunts
the
gay
bubastian
grove
and
owns
she
sees
from
her
bright
above
nothing
on
earth
to
match
that
but
love
thus
did
i
exclaim
in
the
words
of
one
of
their
own
egyptian
poets
as
anticipating
the
various
delights
of
the
festival
i
cast
away
from
my
mind
all
gloomy
thoughts
and
hastening
to
my
little
bark
in
which
i
now
lived
like
a
on
the
waters
steered
my
course
to
the
temple
of
the
moon
chap
the
rising
of
the
moon
slow
and
majestic
as
if
conscious
of
the
honours
that
awaited
her
upon
earth
was
welcomed
with
a
loud
acclaim
from
every
eminence
where
multitudes
stood
watching
for
her
first
light
and
seldom
had
she
risen
upon
a
scene
more
beautiful
memphis
grand
though
no
longer
the
unrivalled
memphis
that
had
borne
away
from
thebes
the
crown
of
supremacy
and
worn
it
undisputed
through
so
many
centuries
softened
by
the
moonlight
that
harmonised
with
her
decline
shone
forth
among
her
lakes
her
pyramids
and
her
shrines
like
a
dream
of
glory
that
was
soon
to
pass
away
ruin
even
now
was
but
too
visible
around
her
the
sands
of
the
libyan
desert
gained
upon
her
like
a
sea
and
among
solitary
columns
and
sphinxes
already
half
sunk
from
sight
time
seemed
to
stand
waiting
till
all
that
now
flourished
around
should
fall
beneath
his
desolating
hand
like
the
rest
on
the
waters
all
was
life
and
gaiety
as
far
as
eye
could
reach
the
lights
of
innumerable
boats
were
seen
studding
like
rubies
the
surface
of
the
stream
vessels
of
all
kinds
the
light
coracle
built
for
shooting
down
the
cataracts
to
the
large
yacht
that
glides
to
the
sound
of
flutes
were
afloat
for
this
sacred
festival
filled
with
crowds
of
the
young
and
the
gay
not
only
from
memphis
and
babylon
but
from
cities
still
farther
removed
from
the
scene
as
i
approached
the
island
i
could
see
glittering
through
the
trees
on
the
bank
the
lamps
of
the
pilgrims
hastening
to
the
ceremony
landing
in
the
direction
which
those
lights
pointed
out
i
soon
joined
the
crowd
and
passing
through
a
long
alley
of
sphinxes
whose
spangling
marble
shone
out
from
the
dark
sycamores
around
them
in
a
short
time
reached
the
grand
vestibule
of
the
temple
where
i
found
the
ceremonies
of
the
evening
already
commenced
in
this
vast
hall
which
was
surrounded
by
a
double
range
of
columns
and
lay
open
to
the
stars
of
heaven
i
saw
a
group
of
young
maidens
moving
in
a
sort
of
measured
step
between
walk
and
dance
round
a
small
shrine
upon
which
stood
one
of
those
sacred
birds
that
on
account
of
the
variegated
colour
of
their
wings
are
dedicated
to
the
moon
the
vestibule
was
dimly
lighted
being
but
one
lamp
of
naptha
on
each
of
the
great
pillars
that
encircled
it
but
having
taken
my
station
beside
one
of
those
pillars
i
had
a
distinct
view
of
the
young
dancers
as
in
succession
they
passed
me
their
long
graceful
drapery
was
as
white
as
snow
and
each
wore
loosely
beneath
the
rounded
bosom
a
zone
or
bandelet
studded
like
the
skies
at
midnight
with
little
silver
stars
through
their
dark
locks
was
wreathed
the
white
lily
of
the
nile
flower
being
accounted
as
welcome
to
the
moon
as
the
golden
blossoms
of
the
are
to
the
sun
as
they
passed
under
the
lamp
a
gleam
of
light
flashed
from
their
bosoms
which
i
could
perceive
was
the
reflection
of
a
small
mirror
that
in
the
manner
of
the
women
of
the
east
each
wore
beneath
her
left
shoulder
there
was
no
music
to
regulate
their
steps
but
as
they
gracefully
went
round
the
bird
on
the
shrine
some
by
the
beat
of
the
castanet
some
by
the
shrill
ring
of
the
sistrum
they
held
uplifted
in
the
attitude
of
their
own
divine
isis
timed
the
cadence
of
their
feet
while
others
at
every
step
shook
a
small
chain
of
silver
whose
sound
mingling
with
those
of
the
castanets
and
sistrums
produced
a
wild
but
not
an
unpleasing
harmony
they
seemed
all
lovely
but
there
was
face
the
light
had
not
yet
reached
so
downcast
she
held
it
attracted
and
at
length
riveted
all
my
attention
i
knew
not
why
but
there
was
a
something
in
those
seen
features
charm
in
the
very
shadow
that
hung
over
their
imagined
beauty
took
me
more
than
all
the
loveliness
of
her
companions
so
enchained
was
my
fancy
by
this
coy
mystery
that
her
alone
of
all
the
group
could
i
either
see
or
think
alone
i
watched
as
with
the
same
downcast
brow
she
glided
round
the
altar
gently
and
aërially
as
if
her
presence
like
that
of
a
spirit
was
something
to
be
felt
not
seen
suddenly
while
i
gazed
the
loud
crash
of
a
thousand
cymbals
was
heard
massy
gates
of
the
temple
flew
open
as
if
by
magic
and
a
flood
of
radiance
from
the
illuminated
aisle
filled
the
whole
vestibule
while
at
the
same
instant
as
if
the
light
and
the
sounds
were
born
together
a
peal
of
rich
harmony
came
mingling
with
the
radiance
it
was
then
that
light
which
shone
full
upon
the
young
features
as
starting
at
the
blaze
she
raised
her
eyes
to
the
portal
and
as
suddenly
let
fall
their
lids
again
was
then
i
beheld
what
even
my
own
ardent
imagination
in
its
most
vivid
dreams
of
beauty
had
never
pictured
not
psyche
herself
when
pausing
on
the
threshold
of
heaven
while
its
first
glories
fell
on
her
dazzled
lids
could
have
looked
more
beautiful
or
blushed
with
a
more
innocent
shame
often
as
i
had
felt
the
power
of
looks
none
had
ever
entered
into
my
soul
so
far
it
was
a
new
new
as
suddenly
as
that
radiance
into
the
vestibule
and
at
once
filling
my
whole
being
had
that
vision
but
lingered
another
moment
before
my
eyes
i
should
have
wholly
forgotten
who
i
was
and
where
and
thrown
myself
in
prostrate
adoration
at
her
feet
but
scarcely
had
that
gush
of
harmony
been
heard
when
the
sacred
bird
which
had
till
now
stood
motionless
as
an
image
expanded
his
wings
and
flew
into
the
temple
while
his
graceful
young
worshippers
with
a
fleetness
like
his
own
followed
she
who
had
left
a
dream
in
my
heart
never
to
be
forgotten
vanished
with
the
rest
as
she
went
rapidly
past
the
pillar
against
which
i
leaned
the
ivy
that
encircled
it
caught
in
her
drapery
and
disengaged
some
ornament
which
fell
to
the
ground
it
was
the
small
mirror
which
i
had
seen
shining
on
her
bosom
hastily
and
tremulously
i
picked
it
up
and
hurried
to
restore
it
she
was
already
lost
to
my
eyes
in
the
crowd
in
vain
i
tried
to
follow
aisles
were
already
filled
and
numbers
of
eager
pilgrims
pressed
towards
the
portal
but
the
servants
of
the
temple
prevented
all
further
entrance
and
still
as
i
presented
myself
their
white
wands
barred
the
way
perplexed
and
irritated
amid
that
crowd
of
faces
regarding
all
as
enemies
that
impeded
my
progress
i
stood
on
tiptoe
gazing
into
the
busy
aisles
and
with
a
heart
beating
as
i
caught
from
time
to
time
a
glimpse
of
some
spangled
zone
or
lotus
wreath
which
led
me
to
fancy
that
i
had
discovered
the
object
of
my
search
but
it
was
all
in
vain
every
direction
files
of
sacred
nymphs
were
moving
but
nowhere
could
i
see
her
whom
alone
i
sought
in
this
state
of
breathless
agitation
did
i
stand
for
some
time
with
the
confusion
of
faces
and
lights
as
well
as
with
the
clouds
of
incense
that
rolled
around
me
fevered
and
impatient
i
could
endure
it
no
longer
forcing
my
way
out
of
the
vestibule
into
the
cool
air
i
hurried
back
through
the
alley
of
sphinxes
to
the
shore
and
flung
myself
into
my
boat
there
is
to
the
north
of
memphis
a
solitary
lake
which
at
this
season
of
the
year
mingles
with
the
rest
of
the
waters
upon
whose
shores
stands
the
necropolis
or
city
of
the
place
of
melancholy
grandeur
covered
over
with
shrines
and
pyramids
where
many
a
kingly
head
proud
even
in
death
has
for
ages
awaited
the
resurrection
of
its
glories
through
a
range
of
sepulchral
grots
underneath
the
humbler
denizens
of
the
tomb
are
deposited
out
on
each
successive
generation
that
visits
them
with
the
same
face
and
features
they
wore
centuries
ago
every
plant
and
tree
that
is
consecrated
to
death
from
the
flower
to
the
mystic
plantain
lends
its
sweetness
or
shadow
to
this
place
of
tombs
and
the
only
noise
that
disturbs
its
eternal
calm
is
the
low
humming
sound
of
the
priests
at
prayer
when
a
new
inhabitant
is
added
to
the
silent
city
it
was
towards
this
place
of
death
that
in
a
mood
of
mind
as
usual
half
bright
half
gloomy
i
now
almost
unconsciously
directed
my
bark
the
form
of
the
young
priestess
was
continually
before
me
that
one
bright
look
of
hers
the
very
memory
of
which
was
worth
all
the
actual
smiles
of
others
never
left
my
mind
absorbed
in
such
thoughts
i
rowed
on
scarce
knowing
whither
i
went
till
startled
by
finding
myself
within
the
shadow
of
the
city
of
the
dead
i
looked
up
and
saw
rising
in
succession
before
me
pyramid
beyond
pyramid
each
towering
more
loftily
than
the
other
all
were
in
grandeur
by
one
upon
whose
summit
the
moon
seemed
to
rest
as
on
a
pedestal
drawing
near
to
the
shore
which
was
sufficiently
elevated
to
raise
this
city
of
monuments
above
the
level
of
the
inundation
i
lifted
my
oar
and
let
the
boat
rock
idly
on
the
water
while
my
thoughts
left
equally
without
direction
fluctuated
as
idly
how
various
and
vague
were
the
dreams
that
then
passed
through
my
bright
vision
of
the
temple
mingling
itself
with
all
sometimes
she
stood
before
me
like
an
aërial
spirit
as
pure
as
if
that
element
of
music
and
light
into
which
i
had
seen
her
vanish
was
her
only
dwelling
sometimes
animated
with
passion
and
kindling
into
a
creature
of
earth
she
seemed
to
lean
towards
me
with
looks
of
tenderness
which
it
were
worth
worlds
but
for
one
instant
to
inspire
and
the
dark
fancies
that
ever
haunted
me
saw
her
cold
parched
and
blackening
amid
the
gloom
of
those
eternal
sepulchres
before
me
turning
away
with
a
shudder
from
the
cemetery
at
this
thought
i
heard
the
sound
of
an
oar
plying
swiftly
through
the
water
and
in
a
few
moments
saw
shooting
past
me
towards
the
shore
a
small
boat
in
which
sat
two
female
figures
muffled
up
and
veiled
having
landed
them
not
far
from
the
spot
where
i
lay
by
the
shadow
of
a
monument
on
the
bank
boat
again
departed
with
the
same
fleetness
over
the
flood
never
had
the
prospect
of
an
adventure
come
more
welcome
than
at
this
moment
when
my
fancy
was
weaving
such
chains
for
my
heart
as
threatened
a
bondage
of
all
others
the
most
difficult
to
break
to
become
enamoured
thus
of
a
creature
of
my
own
imagination
was
the
worst
because
the
most
lasting
of
follies
reality
alone
gives
a
chance
of
dissolving
such
spells
and
the
idol
i
was
now
creating
to
myself
must
for
ever
remain
ideal
any
pursuit
therefore
that
seemed
likely
to
divert
me
from
such
bring
back
my
imagination
to
earth
and
reality
from
the
vague
region
in
which
it
was
wandering
was
a
relief
too
seasonable
not
to
be
welcomed
with
eagerness
i
had
watched
the
course
which
the
two
figures
took
and
having
hastily
fastened
my
boat
to
the
bank
stepped
gently
on
shore
and
at
a
little
distance
followed
them
the
windings
through
which
they
led
were
intricate
but
by
the
bright
light
of
the
moon
i
was
enabled
to
keep
their
forms
in
view
as
with
rapid
step
they
glided
among
the
monuments
at
length
in
the
shade
of
a
small
pyramid
whose
peak
barely
surmounted
the
that
grew
nigh
they
vanished
from
my
sight
i
hastened
to
the
spot
but
there
was
not
a
sign
of
life
around
and
had
my
creed
extended
to
another
world
i
might
have
fancied
that
these
forms
were
spirits
sent
from
thence
to
mock
me
instantaneously
they
disappeared
i
searched
through
the
neighbouring
grove
but
all
there
was
still
as
death
at
length
in
examining
one
of
the
sides
of
the
pyramid
which
for
a
few
feet
from
the
ground
was
furnished
with
steps
i
found
midway
between
peak
and
base
a
part
of
the
surface
which
though
presenting
an
appearance
of
smoothness
to
the
eye
gave
to
the
touch
i
thought
indications
of
a
concealed
opening
after
a
variety
of
efforts
and
experiments
i
at
last
more
by
accident
than
skill
pressed
the
spring
that
commanded
this
mysterious
aperture
in
an
instant
the
portal
slid
aside
and
disclosed
a
narrow
within
the
two
or
three
first
steps
of
which
were
discernible
by
the
moonlight
while
the
rest
were
lost
in
utter
darkness
though
it
was
difficult
to
conceive
that
the
persons
whom
i
had
followed
would
have
ventured
to
pass
through
this
gloomy
opening
yet
to
account
for
their
disappearance
otherwise
was
still
more
difficult
at
all
events
my
curiosity
was
now
too
eager
in
the
chase
to
relinquish
it
spirit
of
adventure
once
raised
could
not
be
so
easily
laid
accordingly
having
sent
up
a
gay
prayer
to
that
queen
whose
eye
alone
was
upon
me
i
passed
through
the
portal
and
descended
into
the
pyramid
chap
vi
at
the
bottom
of
the
i
found
myself
in
a
low
narrow
passage
through
which
without
stooping
almost
to
earth
it
was
impossible
to
proceed
though
leading
through
a
multiplicity
of
dark
windings
this
way
seemed
but
little
to
advance
my
progress
course
i
perceived
being
chiefly
circular
and
gathering
at
every
turn
but
a
deeper
intensity
of
darkness
this
i
thought
the
sojourn
of
any
thing
human
had
scarcely
asked
myself
the
question
when
the
path
opened
into
a
long
gallery
at
the
farthest
end
of
which
a
gleam
of
light
was
visible
this
welcome
glimmer
appeared
to
come
from
some
cell
or
alcove
in
which
the
wall
of
the
gallery
terminated
and
breathless
with
expectation
i
stole
gently
towards
it
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
a
scene
presented
itself
to
my
eyes
for
which
my
fondest
expectations
of
adventure
could
not
have
prepared
me
the
place
from
which
the
light
proceeded
was
a
small
chapel
of
whose
interior
from
the
dark
recess
in
which
i
stood
i
had
unseen
myself
a
full
and
distinct
view
over
the
walls
of
this
oratory
were
painted
some
of
those
various
symbols
by
which
the
mystic
wisdom
of
the
egyptians
loves
to
shadow
out
the
history
of
the
winged
globe
with
a
serpent
rays
descending
from
above
like
a
glory
and
the
theban
beetle
as
he
comes
forth
after
the
waters
have
passed
away
and
the
first
sunbeam
falls
on
his
regenerated
wings
in
the
middle
of
the
chapel
stood
a
low
altar
of
granite
on
which
lay
a
lifeless
female
form
enshrined
within
a
case
of
crystal
they
preserve
their
dead
in
ethiopia
looking
as
freshly
beautiful
as
if
the
soul
had
but
a
few
hours
departed
among
the
emblems
of
death
on
the
front
of
the
altar
were
a
slender
broken
in
two
and
a
bird
just
winging
its
flight
from
the
spray
to
these
memorials
of
the
dead
however
i
but
little
attended
for
there
was
a
living
object
there
upon
which
my
eyes
were
most
intently
fixed
the
lamp
by
which
the
whole
of
the
chapel
was
illuminated
was
placed
at
the
head
of
the
pale
image
in
the
shrine
and
between
its
light
and
me
stood
a
female
form
bending
over
the
monument
as
if
to
gaze
upon
the
silent
features
within
the
position
in
which
this
figure
was
placed
intercepting
a
strong
light
afforded
me
at
first
but
an
imperfect
and
shadowy
view
of
it
yet
even
at
this
mere
outline
my
heart
beat
high
memory
as
it
proved
had
as
much
share
in
this
feeling
as
imagination
for
on
the
head
changing
its
position
so
as
to
let
a
gleam
fall
on
the
features
i
saw
with
a
transport
which
had
almost
led
me
to
betray
my
that
it
was
young
worshipper
of
same
the
very
same
whom
i
had
seen
brightening
the
holy
place
where
she
stood
and
looking
like
an
inhabitant
of
some
purer
world
the
movement
by
which
she
had
now
given
me
an
opportunity
of
recognising
her
was
made
in
raising
from
the
shrine
a
small
cross
of
silver
which
lay
directly
over
the
bosom
of
the
lifeless
figure
bringing
it
close
to
her
lips
she
kissed
it
with
a
religious
fervour
then
turning
her
eyes
mournfully
upwards
held
them
fixed
with
an
inspired
earnestness
as
if
at
that
moment
in
direct
communion
with
heaven
they
saw
neither
roof
nor
any
other
earthly
barrier
between
them
and
the
skies
what
a
power
hath
innocence
whose
very
helplessness
is
its
whose
presence
even
passion
himself
stands
abashed
and
turns
worshipper
at
the
altar
which
he
came
to
despoil
she
who
but
a
short
hour
before
had
presented
herself
to
my
imagination
as
something
i
could
have
risked
immortality
to
whom
gladly
from
the
floor
of
her
own
lighted
temple
in
the
very
face
of
its
proud
ministers
i
would
have
borne
away
in
triumph
and
defied
all
punishments
both
human
and
sacred
to
make
her
mine
was
now
before
me
thrown
as
if
by
fate
itself
into
my
there
beautiful
and
alone
with
nothing
but
her
innocence
for
her
guard
yet
touching
was
the
purity
of
the
whole
scene
so
calm
and
august
that
protection
which
the
dead
seemed
to
extend
over
the
living
that
every
earthlier
feeling
was
forgotten
as
i
gazed
and
love
itself
became
exalted
into
reverence
entranced
indeed
as
i
felt
in
witnessing
such
a
scene
thus
to
enjoy
it
by
stealth
seemed
a
wrong
a
rather
than
let
her
eyes
meet
the
flash
of
mine
or
disturb
by
a
whisper
that
sacred
silence
in
which
youth
and
death
held
communion
through
love
i
would
have
let
my
heart
break
without
a
murmur
where
i
stood
gently
as
if
life
depended
upon
every
movement
i
stole
away
from
that
tranquil
and
holy
it
still
tranquil
and
holy
as
i
found
gliding
back
through
the
same
passages
and
windings
by
which
i
had
entered
regained
the
narrow
way
and
again
ascended
into
light
the
sun
had
just
risen
and
from
the
summit
of
the
arabian
hills
was
pouring
down
his
beams
into
that
vast
valley
of
waters
if
proud
of
the
homage
that
had
been
paid
to
his
own
isis
now
fading
away
in
the
superior
light
of
her
lord
my
first
impulse
was
to
fly
from
this
dangerous
spot
and
in
new
loves
and
pleasures
seek
forgetfulness
of
the
scene
which
i
had
witnessed
out
of
the
circle
of
this
enchantment
i
exclaimed
know
my
own
susceptibility
to
new
impressions
too
well
to
doubt
that
i
shall
soon
break
the
spell
that
is
around
but
vain
were
my
efforts
and
resolves
even
while
i
swore
to
fly
my
steps
were
still
lingering
round
the
eyes
still
turned
towards
the
secret
portal
which
severed
this
enchantress
from
the
world
of
the
living
hour
after
hour
did
i
wander
through
that
city
of
silence
already
it
was
noon
and
under
the
meridian
eye
the
mighty
pyramid
of
pyramids
stood
like
a
great
spirit
shadowless
again
did
those
wild
and
passionate
feelings
which
had
for
a
moment
been
subdued
into
reverence
by
her
presence
return
to
kindle
up
my
imagination
and
senses
i
even
reproached
myself
for
the
awe
that
had
held
me
before
her
would
my
companions
of
the
garden
say
did
they
know
that
their
chief
whose
path
love
had
strewed
with
now
pining
for
a
simple
egyptian
girl
in
whose
presence
he
had
not
dared
to
give
utterance
to
a
sigh
and
who
had
vanquished
the
victor
without
even
knowing
her
triumph
a
blush
came
over
my
cheek
at
the
humiliating
thought
and
my
determination
was
fixed
to
await
her
coming
that
she
should
be
an
inmate
of
those
gloomy
caverns
seemed
inconceivable
nor
did
there
appear
to
be
any
issue
from
their
depths
but
by
the
pyramid
again
therefore
like
a
sentinel
of
the
dead
did
i
pace
up
and
down
among
these
tombs
contrasting
in
many
a
mournful
reflection
the
burning
fever
within
my
own
veins
with
the
cold
quiet
of
those
who
slept
around
at
length
the
fierce
glow
of
the
sun
over
my
head
and
still
more
that
ever
restless
agitation
in
my
heart
were
too
much
for
even
strength
like
mine
to
bear
exhausted
i
lay
down
at
the
base
of
the
myself
directly
under
the
portal
where
even
should
slumber
surprise
me
my
heart
if
not
my
ear
might
still
be
on
the
watch
and
her
footstep
light
as
it
was
could
not
fail
to
awake
me
after
many
an
ineffectual
struggle
against
drowsiness
i
at
length
sunk
into
not
into
forgetfulness
the
same
image
still
haunted
me
in
every
variety
of
shape
with
which
imagination
assisted
by
memory
could
invest
it
now
like
neïtha
upon
her
throne
at
saïs
she
seemed
to
sit
with
the
veil
just
raised
from
that
brow
which
mortal
had
never
till
then
beheld
now
like
the
beautiful
enchantress
rhodope
i
saw
her
rise
out
of
the
pyramid
in
which
she
had
dwelt
for
ages
rhodope
as
story
tells
the
bright
unearthly
nymph
who
dwells
mid
sunless
gold
and
jewels
hid
the
lady
of
the
pyramid
so
long
amid
that
unbroken
silence
did
my
sleep
continue
that
i
found
the
moon
again
shining
above
the
horizon
when
i
awoke
all
around
was
silent
and
lifeless
as
before
nor
did
a
print
upon
the
herbage
betray
that
any
foot
had
passed
it
since
my
own
refreshed
by
rest
and
with
a
fancy
still
more
excited
by
the
mystic
wonders
of
which
i
had
been
dreaming
i
now
resolved
to
revisit
the
chapel
in
the
pyramid
and
put
an
end
if
possible
to
this
illusion
that
haunted
me
having
learned
from
the
experience
of
the
preceding
night
the
inconvenience
of
encountering
those
labyrinths
without
a
light
i
now
hastened
to
provide
myself
with
a
lamp
from
my
boat
tracking
my
way
back
with
some
difficulty
to
the
shore
i
there
found
not
only
my
lamp
but
some
dates
and
dried
fruits
with
a
store
of
which
for
my
roving
life
upon
the
waters
i
was
always
supplied
which
now
after
so
many
hours
of
abstinence
were
a
welcome
and
necessary
relief
thus
prepared
i
again
ascended
the
pyramid
and
was
proceeding
to
search
out
the
secret
spring
when
a
loud
dismal
noise
was
heard
at
a
distance
to
which
all
the
echoes
of
the
cemetery
answered
it
came
i
knew
from
the
great
temple
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
and
was
the
shriek
which
its
gates
of
oblivion
as
they
were
forth
from
their
hinges
in
opening
at
night
to
receive
within
their
precincts
the
landed
dead
i
had
heard
that
sound
before
and
always
with
sadness
but
at
this
moment
it
thrilled
through
me
like
a
voice
of
ill
omen
and
i
almost
doubted
whether
i
should
not
abandon
my
enterprise
the
hesitation
however
was
but
momentary
while
it
passed
through
my
mind
i
had
touched
the
spring
of
the
portal
in
a
few
seconds
more
i
was
again
in
the
passage
beneath
the
pyramid
and
being
enabled
by
my
lamp
to
follow
the
windings
of
the
way
more
rapidly
soon
found
myself
at
the
door
of
the
small
chapel
in
the
gallery
i
entered
still
awed
though
there
was
now
nothing
living
within
the
young
priestess
had
vanished
like
a
spirit
into
the
darkness
all
the
rest
was
as
i
had
left
it
on
the
preceding
night
the
lamp
still
stood
burning
upon
the
crystal
cross
lay
where
the
hands
of
the
young
mourner
had
placed
it
and
the
cold
image
beneath
wore
the
same
tranquil
look
as
if
resigned
to
the
solitude
of
all
lone
things
the
loneliest
remembering
the
lips
that
i
had
seen
kiss
that
cross
and
kindling
with
the
recollection
i
raised
it
passionately
to
my
own
at
the
same
moment
i
fancied
the
dead
eyes
met
mine
and
saddened
in
the
midst
of
my
ardour
i
replaced
the
cross
upon
the
shrine
i
had
now
lost
all
clue
to
the
object
of
my
pursuit
and
was
preparing
slowly
to
retrace
my
steps
to
earth
with
that
gloomy
satisfaction
which
certainty
even
when
unwelcome
brings
as
i
held
forth
my
lamp
on
leaving
the
chapel
i
could
perceive
that
the
gallery
instead
of
terminating
here
took
a
sudden
bend
to
the
left
which
had
before
eluded
my
eye
and
which
gave
a
promise
of
leading
still
further
into
those
recesses
by
this
discovery
which
opened
a
new
source
of
hope
to
my
heart
i
cast
but
one
hesitating
look
at
my
lamp
as
if
to
ask
whether
it
would
be
faithful
through
the
gloom
i
was
about
to
encounter
and
without
further
thought
rushed
eagerly
forward
chap
vii
the
path
led
for
some
time
through
the
same
sort
of
narrow
windings
as
those
which
i
had
encountered
in
descending
the
and
at
length
opened
in
a
similar
manner
into
a
straight
and
steep
gallery
along
each
side
of
which
stood
closely
ranged
and
upright
a
file
of
lifeless
bodies
whose
glassy
eyes
threw
a
preternatural
glare
upon
me
as
i
passed
arrived
at
the
end
of
this
gallery
i
found
my
hopes
a
second
time
vanish
the
path
i
perceived
extended
no
further
the
only
object
that
i
could
discern
by
the
glimmering
of
my
lamp
which
now
every
minute
burned
fainter
and
fainter
was
the
mouth
of
a
huge
well
that
lay
gaping
before
reservoir
of
darkness
black
and
unfathomable
it
now
crossed
my
memory
that
i
had
heard
of
such
wells
as
being
used
occasionally
for
passages
by
the
priests
leaning
down
therefore
over
the
edge
i
looked
anxiously
within
to
discover
whether
it
was
possible
to
descend
into
the
chasm
but
the
sides
were
hard
and
smooth
as
glass
being
varnished
all
over
with
that
dark
pitch
which
the
dead
sea
throws
out
on
its
slimy
shore
after
a
more
attentive
scrutiny
however
i
observed
at
the
depth
of
a
few
feet
a
sort
of
iron
step
projecting
dimly
from
the
side
and
below
it
another
which
though
hardly
perceptible
was
just
sufficient
to
encourage
an
adventurous
foot
to
the
trial
though
all
hope
of
tracing
the
young
priestess
was
at
an
end
being
impossible
that
female
foot
should
have
dared
this
descent
as
i
had
so
far
engaged
in
the
adventure
and
there
was
at
least
a
mystery
to
be
unravelled
i
determined
at
all
hazards
to
explore
the
chasm
placing
my
lamp
which
was
hollowed
at
the
bottom
so
as
to
fit
like
a
helmet
firmly
on
my
head
and
having
thus
both
hands
at
liberty
for
exertion
i
set
my
foot
cautiously
on
the
iron
step
and
descended
into
the
well
i
found
the
same
footing
at
regular
intervals
to
a
considerable
depth
and
had
already
counted
near
a
hundred
of
these
steps
when
the
ladder
altogether
ceased
and
i
could
descend
no
farther
in
vain
did
i
stretch
down
my
foot
in
search
of
hard
slippery
sides
were
all
that
it
encountered
at
length
stooping
my
head
so
as
to
let
the
light
fall
below
i
observed
an
opening
or
window
directly
above
the
step
on
which
i
stood
and
taking
for
granted
that
the
way
must
lie
in
that
direction
with
some
little
difficulty
clambered
through
the
aperture
i
now
found
myself
on
a
rude
and
narrow
the
steps
of
which
were
cut
out
of
the
living
rock
and
wound
spirally
downward
in
the
same
direction
as
the
well
almost
dizzy
with
the
descent
which
seemed
as
if
it
would
never
end
i
at
last
reached
the
bottom
where
a
pair
of
massy
iron
gates
closed
directly
across
my
path
as
if
to
forbid
any
further
progress
massy
however
and
gigantic
as
they
were
i
found
to
my
surprise
that
the
hand
of
an
infant
might
have
opened
them
with
readily
did
their
great
folds
give
way
to
my
touch
as
a
that
receives
some
wandering
bird
among
its
no
sooner
however
had
i
passed
through
than
the
din
with
which
the
gates
clashed
together
again
was
such
as
might
have
awakened
death
itself
it
seemed
as
if
every
echo
throughout
that
vast
subterranean
world
from
the
catacombs
of
alexandria
to
valley
of
kings
had
caught
up
and
repeated
the
thundering
sound
startled
however
as
i
was
not
even
this
supernatural
clangour
could
divert
my
attention
from
the
light
that
now
broke
upon
warm
and
welcome
as
are
the
stars
of
his
own
south
to
the
mariner
who
has
been
wandering
through
the
seas
of
the
north
looking
for
the
source
of
this
splendour
i
saw
through
an
archway
opposite
a
long
illuminated
alley
stretching
away
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
fenced
on
one
side
with
thickets
of
odoriferous
shrubs
while
along
the
other
extended
a
line
of
lofty
arcades
from
which
the
light
that
filled
the
whole
area
issued
as
soon
too
as
the
din
of
the
deep
echoes
had
subsided
there
stole
gradually
on
my
ear
a
strain
of
choral
music
which
appeared
to
come
mellowed
and
sweetened
in
its
passage
through
many
a
spacious
hall
within
those
shining
arcades
among
the
voices
i
could
distinguish
some
female
tones
towering
high
and
clear
over
all
the
rest
and
forming
the
spire
as
it
were
into
which
the
harmony
tapered
as
it
rose
so
excited
was
my
fancy
by
this
sudden
enchantment
never
had
i
caught
a
sound
from
the
young
lips
yet
persuaded
myself
that
the
voice
i
now
heard
was
hers
sounding
highest
and
most
heavenly
of
all
that
choir
and
calling
to
me
like
a
distant
spirit
out
of
its
sphere
animated
by
this
thought
i
flew
forward
to
the
archway
but
found
to
my
mortification
that
it
was
guarded
by
a
whose
bars
though
invisible
at
a
distance
resisted
all
my
efforts
to
force
them
while
occupied
in
these
ineffectual
struggles
i
perceived
to
the
left
of
the
archway
a
dark
cavernous
opening
which
seemed
to
lead
in
a
direction
parallel
to
the
lighted
arcades
notwithstanding
my
impatience
however
the
aspect
of
this
passage
as
i
looked
shudderingly
into
it
chilled
my
very
blood
it
was
not
so
much
darkness
as
a
sort
of
livid
and
ghastly
twilight
from
which
a
damp
like
that
of
exhaled
and
through
which
if
my
eyes
did
not
deceive
me
pale
shapes
were
at
that
very
moment
hovering
looking
anxiously
round
to
discover
some
less
formidable
outlet
i
saw
over
the
vast
through
which
i
had
just
passed
a
blue
tremulous
flame
which
after
playing
for
a
few
seconds
over
the
dark
ground
of
the
pediment
settled
gradually
into
characters
of
light
and
formed
the
following
words
you
who
would
try
yon
terrible
track
to
live
or
to
die
but
to
look
you
who
aspire
to
be
purified
there
by
the
terrors
of
fire
of
water
and
air
if
danger
and
pain
and
death
you
despise
again
into
light
you
shall
rise
rise
into
light
with
that
secret
divine
now
shrouded
from
sight
by
the
veils
of
the
shrine
but
here
the
letters
faded
away
into
a
dead
blank
more
awfully
intelligible
than
the
most
eloquent
words
a
new
hope
now
flashed
across
me
the
dream
of
the
garden
which
had
been
for
some
time
almost
forgotten
returned
to
my
mind
i
then
i
exclaimed
the
path
to
the
promised
mystery
and
shall
the
great
secret
of
eternal
life
be
mine
seemed
to
answer
out
of
the
air
that
which
still
was
heard
crowning
the
choir
with
its
single
sweetness
i
hailed
the
omen
with
transport
love
and
immortality
both
beckoning
me
could
give
a
thought
to
fear
with
two
such
bright
hopes
in
view
having
invoked
and
blessed
that
unknown
enchantress
whose
steps
had
led
me
to
this
abode
of
mystery
and
knowledge
i
plunged
into
the
chasm
instead
of
that
vague
spectral
twilight
which
had
at
first
met
my
eye
i
now
found
as
i
entered
a
thick
darkness
which
though
far
less
horrible
was
at
this
moment
still
more
disconcerting
as
my
lamp
which
had
been
for
some
time
almost
useless
was
fast
expiring
resolved
however
to
make
the
most
of
its
last
gleam
i
hastened
with
rapid
step
through
this
gloomy
region
which
seemed
wider
and
more
open
to
the
air
than
any
that
i
had
yet
passed
nor
was
it
long
before
the
appearance
of
a
bright
blaze
in
the
distance
announced
to
me
that
my
first
great
trial
was
at
hand
as
i
drew
nearer
the
flames
burst
high
and
wide
on
all
sides
the
spectacle
that
now
presented
itself
was
such
as
might
have
appalled
even
hearts
more
habituated
to
dangers
than
mine
there
lay
before
me
extending
completely
across
my
path
a
thicket
or
grove
of
the
most
combustible
trees
of
pine
and
arabian
balm
around
their
stems
and
branches
were
coiled
serpents
of
fire
which
twisting
themselves
rapidly
from
bough
to
bough
spread
their
own
fire
as
they
went
and
involved
tree
after
tree
in
one
general
blaze
it
was
indeed
rapid
as
the
burning
of
those
of
ethiopia
whose
light
brightens
at
night
the
distant
cataracts
of
the
nile
through
the
middle
of
this
blazing
grove
i
perceived
my
only
pathway
lay
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
conflagration
gained
rapidly
on
either
side
and
already
the
narrowing
path
between
was
strewed
with
fire
casting
away
my
now
useless
lamp
and
holding
my
robe
as
some
protection
over
my
head
with
a
tremor
i
own
in
every
limb
i
ventured
through
the
blaze
instantly
as
if
my
presence
had
given
new
life
to
the
flames
a
fresh
outbreak
of
combustion
arose
on
all
sides
the
trees
clustered
into
a
bower
of
fire
above
my
head
while
the
serpents
that
hung
hissing
from
the
red
branches
shot
showers
of
sparkles
down
upon
me
as
i
passed
never
were
decision
and
activity
more
serviceable
minute
later
and
i
must
have
perished
the
narrow
opening
of
which
i
had
so
promptly
availed
myself
closed
instantly
behind
me
and
as
i
looked
back
to
contemplate
the
ordeal
which
i
had
passed
i
saw
that
the
whole
grove
was
already
one
mass
of
fire
happy
at
having
escaped
this
first
trial
i
plucked
from
one
of
the
trees
a
bough
that
was
but
just
kindled
and
with
this
for
my
only
guide
hastened
breathlessly
forward
i
had
gone
but
a
few
paces
when
the
path
turned
suddenly
off
downwards
as
i
could
see
by
the
glimmer
of
my
brand
into
a
more
confined
space
through
which
a
chilling
air
as
if
from
some
neighbouring
waters
blew
over
my
brow
nor
had
i
proceeded
very
far
when
the
sound
of
torrents
fell
on
my
ear
as
i
thought
from
time
to
time
with
shrill
wailings
like
the
cries
of
persons
in
danger
or
distress
at
every
step
the
noise
of
the
dashing
waters
increased
and
i
now
perceived
that
i
had
entered
an
immense
rocky
cavern
through
the
middle
of
which
headlong
as
a
the
flood
to
whose
roar
i
had
been
listening
rushed
upon
its
surface
too
there
floated
strange
shapes
which
as
they
went
by
sent
forth
those
dismal
shrieks
as
if
in
fear
of
some
precipice
to
whose
brink
they
were
hurrying
i
saw
too
plainly
that
my
course
must
be
across
that
torrent
it
was
fearful
but
in
courage
lay
my
only
hope
what
awaited
me
on
the
opposite
shore
i
knew
not
for
all
there
was
wrapped
in
impenetrable
gloom
nor
could
the
weak
light
i
held
reach
half
so
far
dismissing
however
all
thoughts
but
that
of
pressing
onward
i
sprung
from
the
rock
on
which
i
stood
into
the
flood
that
with
my
right
hand
i
should
be
able
to
buffet
the
current
while
with
the
other
i
might
contrive
to
hold
my
brand
aloft
as
long
as
a
glimmer
of
it
remained
to
guide
me
to
the
shore
long
and
formidable
was
the
struggle
i
had
to
maintain
more
than
once
overpowered
by
the
rush
of
the
waters
i
had
almost
given
myself
up
as
destined
to
follow
those
apparitions
that
still
passed
me
hurrying
with
mournful
cries
to
their
doom
in
some
invisible
gulf
before
them
at
length
just
as
my
strength
was
nearly
exhausted
and
the
last
remains
of
the
were
falling
from
my
hand
i
saw
outstretching
towards
me
into
the
water
a
light
double
balustrade
with
a
flight
of
steps
between
ascending
almost
perpendicularly
from
the
wave
till
they
seemed
lost
in
a
dense
mass
of
clouds
above
this
it
was
no
more
as
my
light
expired
in
giving
new
spring
to
my
courage
having
now
both
hands
at
liberty
so
desperate
were
my
efforts
that
after
a
few
struggle
i
felt
my
brow
strike
against
the
stairway
and
in
an
instant
more
my
feet
were
on
the
steps
rejoiced
at
my
rescue
from
that
perilous
flood
though
i
knew
not
whither
the
stairway
led
i
promptly
ascended
it
but
this
feeling
of
confidence
was
of
short
duration
i
had
not
mounted
far
when
to
my
horror
i
perceived
that
each
successive
step
as
my
foot
left
it
broke
away
from
beneath
me
me
in
midair
with
no
other
alternative
than
that
of
mounting
still
by
the
same
momentary
footing
and
with
the
dreadful
doubt
whether
it
would
even
endure
my
tread
and
thus
did
i
for
a
few
seconds
continue
to
ascend
with
nothing
beneath
me
but
that
awful
river
in
tranquil
it
had
could
hear
the
plash
of
the
falling
fragments
as
every
step
in
succession
gave
way
under
my
feet
it
was
a
trying
moment
but
still
worse
remained
i
now
found
the
balustrade
by
which
i
had
held
during
my
ascent
and
which
had
hitherto
seemed
firm
grow
tremulous
in
my
hand
the
step
to
which
i
was
about
to
trust
myself
tottered
under
my
foot
just
then
a
momentary
flash
as
if
of
lightning
broke
around
and
i
saw
hanging
out
of
the
clouds
within
my
reach
a
huge
brazen
ring
instinctively
i
stretched
forth
my
arm
to
seize
it
and
at
the
same
instant
both
balustrade
and
steps
gave
way
beneath
me
and
i
was
left
swinging
by
my
hands
in
the
dark
void
as
if
too
this
massy
ring
which
i
grasped
was
by
some
magic
power
linked
with
all
the
winds
in
heaven
no
sooner
had
i
seized
it
than
like
the
touching
of
a
spring
it
seemed
to
give
loose
to
every
variety
of
gusts
and
tempests
that
ever
strewed
the
with
wrecks
or
dead
and
as
i
swung
about
the
sport
of
this
elemental
strife
each
new
burst
of
its
fury
threatened
to
shiver
me
like
a
to
atoms
nor
was
even
this
the
worst
holding
i
know
not
how
by
the
ring
i
felt
myself
caught
up
as
if
by
a
thousand
whirlwinds
and
round
and
round
like
a
in
a
sling
whirled
in
the
midst
of
all
this
deafening
chaos
till
my
brain
grew
dizzy
and
my
recollection
confused
and
i
almost
fancied
myself
on
that
wheel
of
the
infernal
world
whose
rotations
it
is
said
eternity
alone
can
number
human
strength
could
no
longer
sustain
such
a
trial
i
was
on
the
point
at
last
of
loosing
my
hold
when
suddenly
the
violence
of
the
storm
moderated
whirl
through
the
air
gradually
ceased
and
i
felt
the
ring
slowly
descend
with
me
as
a
shipwrecked
mariner
at
the
first
touch
of
found
my
feet
once
more
upon
firm
ground
at
the
same
moment
a
light
of
the
most
delicious
softness
filled
the
whole
air
music
such
as
is
heard
in
dreams
came
floating
at
a
distance
and
as
my
eyes
gradually
recovered
their
powers
of
vision
a
scene
of
glory
was
revealed
to
them
almost
too
bright
for
imagination
and
yet
living
and
real
as
far
as
the
sight
could
reach
enchanting
gardens
were
seen
opening
away
through
long
tracts
of
light
and
verdure
and
sparkling
every
where
with
fountains
that
circulated
like
streams
of
life
among
the
flowers
not
a
charm
was
here
wanting
that
the
imagination
of
poet
or
prophet
in
their
pictures
of
elysium
ever
yet
dreamed
or
promised
vistas
opening
into
scenes
of
indistinct
grandeur
shining
out
at
intervals
in
their
shadowy
course
labyrinths
of
flowers
leading
by
mysterious
windings
to
green
spacious
glades
full
of
splendour
and
repose
over
all
this
too
there
fell
a
light
from
some
unseen
source
resembling
nothing
that
illumines
our
upper
sort
of
golden
moonlight
mingling
the
warm
radiance
of
day
with
the
calm
and
melancholy
lustre
of
night
nor
were
there
wanting
inhabitants
for
this
sunless
paradise
through
all
the
bright
gardens
were
wandering
with
the
serene
air
and
step
of
happy
spirits
groups
both
of
young
and
old
of
venerable
and
of
lovely
forms
bearing
most
of
them
the
white
flowers
on
their
heads
and
branches
of
the
eternal
palm
in
their
hands
while
over
the
verdant
turf
fair
children
and
maidens
went
dancing
to
aërial
music
whose
source
was
like
that
of
the
light
invisible
but
which
filled
the
whole
air
with
its
mystic
sweetness
exhausted
as
i
was
by
the
trials
i
had
undergone
no
sooner
did
i
perceive
those
fair
groups
in
the
distance
than
my
weariness
both
of
frame
and
spirit
was
forgotten
a
thought
crossed
me
that
she
whom
i
sought
might
be
among
them
and
notwithstanding
the
awe
with
which
that
unearthly
scene
inspired
me
i
was
about
to
fly
on
the
instant
to
ascertain
my
hope
but
in
the
act
of
making
the
effort
i
felt
my
robe
gently
pulled
and
turning
beheld
an
aged
man
before
me
whom
by
the
sacred
hue
of
his
garb
i
knew
to
be
a
hierophant
placing
a
branch
of
the
consecrated
palm
in
my
hand
he
said
in
a
solemn
voice
of
the
mysteries
welcome
regarding
me
for
a
few
seconds
with
grave
attention
added
in
a
tone
of
courteousness
and
interest
victory
over
the
body
hath
been
gained
me
young
greek
to
thy
resting
i
obeyed
in
silence
the
priest
turning
away
from
this
scene
of
splendour
into
a
secluded
path
where
the
light
faded
away
as
we
advanced
conducted
me
to
a
small
pavilion
by
the
side
of
a
whispering
stream
where
the
very
spirit
of
slumber
seemed
to
preside
and
pointing
to
a
bed
of
dried
within
it
left
me
to
repose
chap
viii
though
the
sight
of
that
splendid
scene
which
opened
upon
me
like
a
momentary
glimpse
into
another
world
had
for
an
instant
my
strength
and
spirit
so
completely
had
fatigue
overmastered
my
whole
frame
that
even
had
the
form
of
the
young
priestess
stood
before
me
my
limbs
would
have
sunk
in
the
effort
to
reach
her
no
sooner
had
i
fallen
on
my
leafy
couch
than
sleep
like
a
sudden
death
came
over
me
and
i
lay
for
hours
in
the
deep
and
motionless
rest
which
not
even
a
shadow
of
life
disturbs
on
awaking
i
saw
beside
me
the
same
venerable
personage
who
had
welcomed
me
to
this
subterranean
world
on
the
preceding
night
at
the
foot
of
my
couch
stood
a
statue
of
grecian
workmanship
representing
a
boy
with
wings
seated
gracefully
on
a
and
having
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
pressed
to
his
lips
this
action
together
with
the
glory
round
his
brows
denoted
as
i
already
knew
the
god
of
silence
and
light
impatient
to
know
what
further
trials
awaited
me
i
was
about
to
speak
when
the
priest
exclaimed
anxiously
pointing
to
this
statue
at
the
foot
of
the
couch
the
spell
of
that
spirit
be
on
thy
lips
young
stranger
till
the
wisdom
of
thy
instructors
shall
think
fit
to
remove
it
not
unaptly
doth
the
same
god
preside
over
silence
and
light
since
it
is
only
out
of
the
depth
of
contemplative
silence
that
the
great
light
of
the
soul
truth
arises
little
used
to
the
language
of
dictation
or
instruction
i
was
now
preparing
to
rise
when
the
priest
again
restrained
me
and
at
the
same
moment
two
boys
beautiful
as
the
young
genii
of
the
stars
entered
the
pavilion
they
were
habited
in
long
garments
of
the
purest
white
and
bore
each
a
small
golden
chalice
in
his
hand
advancing
towards
me
they
stopped
on
opposite
sides
of
the
couch
and
one
of
them
presenting
to
me
his
chalice
of
gold
said
in
a
tone
between
singing
and
speaking
of
this
sips
the
same
in
his
halls
below
and
the
same
he
gives
to
cool
the
lips
of
the
dead
who
downward
go
of
this
water
within
is
fresh
from
stream
make
the
past
with
all
its
sin
and
all
its
pain
and
sorrows
seem
like
a
dream
pleasure
whose
charms
are
in
woe
the
knowledge
that
harms
the
soul
to
know
hope
that
bright
as
the
lake
of
the
waste
allures
the
sight
but
mocks
the
taste
love
that
binds
its
innocent
wreath
where
the
serpent
winds
in
venom
beneath
that
of
evil
or
false
by
thee
hath
ever
been
known
or
seen
shall
melt
away
in
this
cup
and
be
forgot
as
it
never
had
been
unwilling
to
throw
a
slight
on
this
strange
ceremony
i
leaned
forward
with
all
due
gravity
and
tasted
the
cup
which
i
had
no
sooner
done
than
the
young
on
the
other
side
invited
my
attention
and
in
his
turn
presenting
the
chalice
which
he
held
sung
with
a
voice
still
sweeter
than
that
of
his
companion
the
following
strain
of
this
isis
led
her
boy
of
old
to
the
beaming
sky
she
mingled
a
draught
divine
and
of
this
cup
never
die
do
i
say
and
sing
to
thee
heir
of
that
boundless
on
high
though
frail
and
and
lost
thou
be
drink
of
this
cup
never
die
much
as
i
had
endeavoured
to
keep
my
philosophy
on
its
guard
against
the
illusions
with
which
i
knew
this
region
abounded
the
young
had
here
touched
a
spring
of
imagination
over
which
as
has
been
seen
my
philosophy
had
but
little
controul
no
sooner
had
the
words
shalt
never
die
struck
on
my
ear
than
the
dream
of
the
garden
came
fully
to
my
mind
and
starting
from
the
couch
i
stretched
forth
my
hands
to
the
cup
recollecting
myself
however
and
fearful
of
having
betrayed
to
others
a
weakness
only
fit
for
my
own
secret
indulgence
with
an
affected
smile
of
indifference
i
sunk
back
again
on
my
couch
the
young
minstrel
but
little
interrupted
by
my
movement
still
continued
his
strain
of
which
i
heard
but
the
concluding
words
memory
too
with
her
dreams
shall
come
dreams
of
a
former
happier
day
when
heaven
was
still
the
home
and
her
wings
had
not
yet
fallen
away
of
glory
forgot
that
tell
like
gleams
on
a
sunset
sea
what
once
hath
been
what
now
is
not
but
oh
what
again
shall
brightly
be
though
the
assurances
of
immortality
contained
in
these
verses
would
at
any
other
moment
and
visionary
as
i
thought
them
sent
my
fancy
wandering
into
reveries
of
the
future
the
effort
of
i
had
just
made
enabled
me
to
hear
them
with
indifference
having
gone
through
the
form
of
tasting
this
second
cup
i
again
looked
anxiously
to
the
hierophant
to
ascertain
whether
i
might
be
permitted
to
rise
his
assent
having
been
given
the
young
pages
brought
to
my
couch
a
robe
and
tunic
which
like
their
own
were
of
linen
of
the
purest
white
and
having
assisted
to
clothe
me
in
this
sacred
garb
they
then
placed
upon
my
head
a
chaplet
of
myrtle
in
which
the
symbol
of
initiation
a
golden
grasshopper
was
seen
shining
out
from
among
the
dark
leaves
though
sleep
had
done
much
to
refresh
my
frame
something
more
was
still
wanting
to
restore
its
strength
and
it
was
not
without
a
smile
at
my
own
reveries
i
reflected
how
much
more
welcome
than
the
young
cup
of
immortality
was
the
unpretending
but
real
repast
now
set
before
me
fruits
from
the
isle
of
gardens
in
the
nile
the
delicate
flesh
of
the
desert
antelope
and
wine
from
the
vineyard
of
the
queens
at
anthylla
fanned
by
one
of
the
pages
with
a
to
keep
it
cool
having
done
justice
to
these
dainties
it
was
with
pleasure
i
heard
the
proposal
of
the
priest
that
we
should
now
walk
forth
together
and
meditate
among
the
scenes
without
i
had
not
forgotten
the
elysium
that
welcomed
me
last
night
enchanted
gardens
that
mysterious
music
and
light
and
the
fair
forms
i
saw
wandering
about
if
in
the
very
midst
of
happiness
still
seeking
it
the
hope
which
had
then
occurred
to
me
that
perhaps
among
those
sparkling
groups
might
be
the
maiden
i
sought
now
returned
with
increased
strength
i
had
little
doubt
that
my
guide
was
about
to
lead
to
the
same
elysian
scene
and
that
the
form
so
fit
to
inhabit
it
would
again
appear
before
my
eyes
but
far
different
was
the
region
to
which
he
conducted
me
nor
could
the
whole
world
produce
a
scene
more
gloomy
or
more
strange
it
had
the
appearance
of
a
small
solitary
valley
inclosed
on
every
side
by
rocks
which
seemed
to
rise
almost
perpendicularly
to
the
very
sky
it
was
indeed
the
blue
sky
that
i
saw
shining
between
their
summits
and
whose
light
dimmed
and
half
lost
in
its
descent
thus
far
formed
the
melancholy
daylight
of
this
nether
world
down
the
side
of
these
rocky
walls
fell
a
cataract
whose
source
was
upon
earth
and
on
whose
waters
as
they
rolled
glassily
over
the
edge
above
a
gleam
of
radiance
rested
that
showed
how
brilliant
was
the
sunshine
they
left
from
thence
gradually
darkening
and
broken
in
its
long
descent
by
alternate
chasms
and
projections
the
stream
fell
at
last
in
a
pale
and
thin
phantom
of
what
it
had
been
on
a
small
lake
that
lay
at
the
base
of
the
rock
to
receive
it
nothing
could
be
more
bleak
and
saddening
than
the
appearance
of
this
lake
the
usual
ornaments
of
the
waters
of
egypt
were
not
wanting
the
lotus
here
uplifted
her
silvery
flowers
and
the
crimson
flamingo
floated
over
the
tide
but
they
were
neither
of
them
the
same
as
in
the
upper
world
flower
had
exchanged
its
whiteness
for
a
livid
hue
and
the
wings
of
the
bird
hung
heavy
and
colourless
every
thing
wore
the
same
aspect
and
the
only
sounds
that
disturbed
the
mournful
stillness
were
the
wailing
cry
of
a
heron
among
the
sedges
and
that
din
of
the
waters
in
their
midway
struggle
above
there
was
an
unearthly
sadness
in
the
whole
scene
of
which
no
heart
however
light
could
resist
the
influence
perceiving
how
i
was
affected
by
it
scenes
said
the
priest
best
suited
to
that
solemn
complexion
of
mind
which
becomes
him
who
approaches
the
great
secret
of
futurity
behold
in
saying
thus
he
pointed
to
the
opening
over
our
heads
through
which
i
could
perceive
a
star
or
two
twinkling
in
the
heavens
though
the
sun
had
but
a
short
time
passed
his
meridian
from
this
gloomy
depth
we
can
see
those
stars
which
are
now
invisible
to
the
dwellers
upon
the
bright
earth
even
so
to
the
sad
and
spirit
doth
many
a
mystery
of
heaven
reveal
itself
of
which
they
who
walk
in
the
light
of
the
proud
world
know
not
he
now
led
me
towards
a
rustic
seat
or
alcove
beside
which
stood
an
image
of
that
dark
deity
that
god
without
a
smile
who
presides
over
the
kingdom
of
the
dead
the
same
livid
and
lifeless
hue
was
upon
his
features
that
hung
over
every
thing
in
this
dim
valley
and
with
his
right
hand
he
pointed
directly
downwards
to
denote
that
his
melancholy
kingdom
lay
there
a
favourite
tree
of
the
genii
of
behind
the
statue
and
spread
its
branches
over
the
alcove
in
which
the
priest
now
seating
himself
signified
that
i
should
take
my
place
by
his
side
after
a
long
pause
as
if
of
thought
and
preparation
said
he
greek
hast
thou
sustained
the
first
trials
of
initiation
what
remains
though
of
vital
import
to
the
soul
brings
with
it
neither
pain
nor
peril
to
the
body
having
now
proved
and
chastened
thy
mortal
frame
by
the
three
ordeals
of
fire
of
water
and
of
air
the
next
task
to
which
we
are
called
is
the
purification
of
thy
spirit
cleansing
of
that
inward
and
immortal
part
so
as
to
render
it
fit
for
the
reception
of
the
last
luminous
revealment
when
the
veils
of
the
sanctuary
shall
be
thrown
aside
and
the
great
secret
of
secrets
unfolded
to
thee
this
object
the
primary
and
most
essential
step
is
instruction
what
the
three
purifying
elements
through
which
thou
hast
passed
have
done
for
thy
body
instruction
will
effect
that
lovely
maiden
i
exclaimed
bursting
from
my
silence
having
fallen
during
his
speech
into
a
deep
revery
in
which
i
had
forgotten
him
myself
the
great
secret
every
her
startled
by
this
profane
interruption
he
cast
a
look
of
alarm
towards
the
statue
as
if
fearful
lest
the
god
should
have
heard
my
words
then
turning
to
me
in
a
tone
of
mild
solemnity
is
but
too
plain
said
he
thoughts
of
the
upper
world
and
of
its
vain
delights
still
engross
thee
too
much
to
let
the
lessons
of
truth
sink
profitably
into
thy
heart
a
few
hours
of
meditation
amid
this
solemn
that
wholesome
meditation
which
purifies
by
haply
dispose
thee
to
receive
with
reverence
the
holy
and
immortal
knowledge
that
is
in
store
for
thee
with
this
hope
i
now
leave
thee
to
thy
own
thoughts
and
to
that
god
before
whose
calm
and
mournful
eye
the
vanities
of
the
world
from
which
thou
comest
wither
thus
saying
he
turned
slowly
away
and
passing
behind
the
statue
towards
which
he
had
pointed
during
the
last
sentence
suddenly
and
as
if
by
enchantment
disappeared
from
my
sight
chap
ix
being
left
to
my
own
solitary
thoughts
i
had
now
leisure
to
reflect
with
coolness
on
the
inconveniences
if
not
dangers
of
the
situation
into
which
my
love
of
adventure
had
hurried
me
however
ready
my
imagination
was
to
kindle
in
its
own
ideal
sphere
i
have
ever
found
that
when
brought
into
contact
with
reality
it
as
suddenly
cooled
those
meteors
that
seem
stars
in
the
air
but
the
moment
they
touch
earth
are
extinguished
such
was
the
disenchantment
that
now
succeeded
to
the
dreams
in
which
i
had
been
indulging
as
long
as
fancy
had
the
field
of
the
future
to
herself
even
immortality
did
not
seem
too
distant
a
race
for
her
but
when
human
instruments
interposed
the
illusion
vanished
from
mortal
lips
the
promise
of
immortality
seemed
a
mockery
and
imagination
herself
had
no
wings
that
could
carry
beyond
the
grave
nor
was
this
disappointment
the
only
feeling
that
occupied
me
imprudence
of
the
step
which
i
had
taken
now
appeared
in
its
full
extent
before
my
eyes
i
had
thrown
myself
into
the
power
of
the
most
artful
priesthood
in
the
world
without
a
chance
of
being
able
to
escape
from
their
toils
or
to
resist
any
machinations
with
which
they
might
beset
me
it
seemed
evident
from
the
state
of
preparation
in
which
i
had
found
all
that
wonderful
apparatus
by
which
the
terrors
and
splendours
of
initiation
are
produced
that
my
descent
into
the
pyramid
was
not
unexpected
numerous
indeed
and
active
as
were
the
spies
of
the
sacred
college
of
memphis
there
could
be
but
little
doubt
that
all
my
movements
since
my
arrival
had
been
tracked
and
the
many
hours
i
had
passed
in
watching
and
wandering
round
the
pyramid
betrayed
a
curiosity
which
might
well
inspire
these
wily
priests
with
the
hope
of
drawing
an
epicurean
into
their
superstitious
toils
i
well
knew
their
hatred
to
the
sect
of
which
i
was
chief
they
considered
the
epicureans
as
next
to
the
christians
the
most
formidable
enemies
of
their
craft
and
power
thoughtless
then
i
exclaimed
have
placed
myself
in
a
situation
where
i
am
equally
helpless
against
their
fraud
and
violence
and
must
either
seem
to
be
the
dupe
of
their
impostures
or
submit
to
become
the
victim
of
their
of
these
alternatives
bitter
as
they
were
the
latter
appeared
by
far
the
more
welcome
i
blushed
even
to
think
of
the
mockeries
to
which
i
already
had
yielded
and
the
prospect
of
being
put
through
still
further
ceremonials
and
of
being
tutored
and
preached
to
by
hypocrites
i
despised
appeared
to
me
in
my
present
temper
a
trial
of
patience
to
which
the
flames
and
the
whirlwinds
i
had
already
encountered
were
pastime
often
and
impatiently
did
i
look
up
between
those
rocky
walls
to
the
bright
sky
that
appeared
to
rest
upon
their
summits
as
round
and
round
through
every
part
of
the
valley
i
endeavoured
to
find
an
outlet
from
its
gloomy
precincts
but
in
vain
i
endeavoured
rocky
barrier
which
seemed
to
end
but
in
heaven
interposed
itself
every
where
neither
did
the
image
of
the
young
maiden
though
constantly
in
my
mind
now
bring
with
it
the
least
consolation
or
hope
of
what
avail
was
it
that
she
perhaps
was
an
inhabitant
of
this
region
if
i
could
neither
see
her
smile
nor
catch
the
sound
of
her
voice
while
among
preaching
priests
i
wasted
away
my
hours
her
presence
diffused
its
enchantment
elsewhere
at
length
exhausted
i
lay
down
by
the
brink
of
the
lake
and
gave
myself
up
to
all
the
melancholy
of
my
fancy
the
pale
semblance
of
daylight
which
had
hitherto
shone
around
grew
every
moment
more
dim
and
dismal
even
the
rich
gleam
at
the
summit
of
the
cascade
had
faded
and
the
sunshine
like
the
water
exhausted
in
its
descent
had
now
dwindled
into
a
ghostly
glimmer
far
worse
than
darkness
the
birds
upon
the
lake
as
if
about
to
die
with
the
dying
light
sunk
down
their
heads
and
as
i
looked
to
the
statue
the
deepening
shadows
gave
an
expression
to
its
mournful
features
that
chilled
my
very
soul
the
thought
of
death
ever
ready
to
present
itself
to
my
imagination
now
came
with
a
disheartening
weight
such
as
i
had
never
before
felt
i
almost
fancied
myself
already
in
the
dark
vestibule
of
the
grave
for
ever
from
the
world
above
and
with
nothing
but
the
blank
of
an
eternal
sleep
before
me
it
had
often
i
knew
happened
that
the
visitants
of
this
mysterious
realm
were
after
their
descent
from
earth
never
seen
or
heard
of
condemned
for
some
failure
in
their
initiatory
trials
to
pine
away
their
lives
in
the
dark
dungeons
with
which
as
well
as
with
altars
this
region
abounded
such
i
shuddered
to
think
might
probably
be
my
destiny
and
so
appalling
was
the
thought
that
even
the
spirit
of
defiance
died
within
me
and
i
was
already
giving
myself
up
to
helplessness
and
despair
at
length
after
some
hours
of
this
gloomy
musing
i
heard
a
rustling
in
the
sacred
grove
behind
the
statue
and
soon
after
the
sound
of
the
welcome
than
i
had
ever
thought
such
voice
could
the
assurance
that
i
was
not
yet
at
least
wholly
abandoned
finding
his
way
to
me
through
the
gloom
he
now
led
me
to
the
same
spot
on
which
we
had
parted
so
many
hours
before
and
in
a
voice
that
retained
no
trace
of
displeasure
bespoke
my
attention
while
he
should
reveal
to
me
some
of
those
divine
truths
by
whose
infusion
he
said
into
the
soul
of
man
its
purification
can
alone
be
effected
the
valley
had
now
become
so
wholly
dark
that
we
could
no
longer
discern
each
faces
as
we
sat
there
was
a
melancholy
in
the
voice
of
my
instructor
that
well
accorded
with
the
gloom
around
us
and
saddened
and
subdued
i
now
listened
with
resignation
if
not
with
interest
to
those
sublime
but
alas
i
thought
vain
tenets
which
with
the
warmth
of
a
believer
this
hierophant
expounded
to
me
he
spoke
of
the
of
the
soul
its
abode
from
all
eternity
in
a
place
of
bliss
of
which
all
that
we
have
most
beautiful
in
our
conceptions
here
is
but
a
dim
transcript
a
clouded
remembrance
in
the
blue
depths
of
ether
he
said
lay
that
of
the
soul
boundary
alone
visible
in
the
line
of
milky
light
that
separates
it
as
by
a
barrier
of
stars
from
the
dark
earth
realm
of
purity
home
of
the
yet
unfallen
spirit
in
the
days
of
her
primal
innocence
she
wandered
ere
her
beauty
was
soiled
by
the
touch
of
earth
or
her
resplendent
wings
had
withered
away
methinks
he
cried
see
at
this
moment
those
fields
of
radiance
look
back
through
the
mists
of
life
into
that
luminous
world
where
the
souls
that
have
never
lost
their
high
heavenly
rank
still
soar
without
a
stain
above
the
shadowless
stars
and
dwell
together
in
infinite
perfection
and
bliss
as
he
spoke
these
words
a
burst
of
pure
brilliant
light
like
a
sudden
opening
of
heaven
broke
through
the
valley
and
as
soon
as
my
eyes
were
able
to
endure
the
splendour
such
a
vision
of
loveliness
and
glory
opened
upon
them
as
took
even
my
sceptical
spirit
by
surprise
and
made
it
yield
at
once
to
the
potency
of
the
spell
suspended
as
i
thought
in
air
and
occupying
the
whole
of
the
opposite
region
of
the
valley
there
appeared
an
immense
orb
of
light
within
which
through
a
haze
of
radiance
i
could
see
distinctly
groups
of
young
female
spirits
who
in
silent
but
harmonious
movement
like
that
of
the
stars
wound
slowly
through
a
variety
of
fanciful
evolutions
and
as
they
linked
and
unlinked
each
arms
formed
a
living
labyrinth
of
beauty
and
grace
though
their
feet
seemed
to
tread
along
a
field
of
light
they
had
also
wings
of
the
richest
hue
which
like
rainbows
over
waterfalls
when
played
with
by
the
breeze
at
every
moment
reflected
a
new
variety
of
glory
as
i
stood
gazing
with
wonder
the
orb
with
all
its
ethereal
inmates
gradually
receded
into
the
dark
void
lessening
as
it
went
and
growing
more
bright
as
it
lessened
at
length
distant
apparently
as
a
retiring
comet
this
little
world
of
spirits
in
one
small
point
of
intense
radiance
shone
its
last
and
vanished
exclaimed
the
rapt
priest
happy
souls
of
whose
dwelling
a
glimpse
is
thus
given
to
our
eyes
go
wander
in
your
orb
through
the
boundless
heaven
nor
ever
let
a
thought
of
this
perishable
world
come
to
mingle
its
dross
with
your
divine
nature
or
tempt
you
to
that
earthward
fall
by
which
spirits
as
bright
have
been
ruined
a
pause
ensued
during
which
still
under
the
influence
of
wonder
i
sent
my
fancy
wandering
after
the
inhabitants
of
that
orb
wishing
myself
credulous
enough
to
believe
in
a
heaven
of
which
creatures
so
like
all
that
i
most
loved
on
earth
were
inmates
at
length
the
priest
with
a
sigh
at
the
contrast
he
was
about
to
draw
between
the
happy
spirits
we
had
just
seen
and
the
fallen
ones
of
earth
resumed
his
melancholy
history
of
the
soul
tracing
it
from
the
first
moment
of
earthward
desire
to
its
final
eclipse
in
the
shadows
of
this
world
he
dwelt
upon
every
stage
of
its
darkening
descent
with
a
pathos
that
sent
sadness
into
the
very
depths
of
the
heart
the
first
downward
look
of
the
spirit
towards
tremble
of
her
wings
on
the
edge
of
giddy
slide
at
length
down
that
fatal
descent
and
the
lethæan
cup
midway
in
the
sky
of
which
when
she
has
once
tasted
heaven
is
forgot
all
these
gradations
he
mournfully
traced
her
fall
to
the
last
stage
of
darkness
when
wholly
immersed
in
this
world
her
celestial
nature
is
changed
she
can
no
longer
rise
above
earth
nor
remembers
her
home
but
by
glimpses
so
vague
that
mistaking
for
hope
what
is
only
memory
she
believes
them
to
be
a
light
from
the
future
not
the
past
retrieve
this
ruin
of
the
once
blessed
clear
away
from
around
her
the
clouds
of
earth
and
restoring
her
lost
wings
facilitate
their
return
to
said
the
reverend
man
the
great
task
of
our
religion
and
such
the
triumph
of
those
divine
mysteries
in
which
the
life
and
essence
of
our
religion
lie
however
sunk
and
changed
and
clouded
may
be
the
spirit
as
long
as
a
single
trace
of
her
original
light
remains
there
is
yet
hope
here
his
voice
was
interrupted
by
a
strain
of
mournful
music
of
which
the
low
distant
breathings
had
been
for
some
minutes
heard
but
which
now
gained
upon
the
ear
too
thrillingly
to
let
it
listen
to
any
more
earthly
sound
a
faint
light
too
at
that
instant
broke
through
the
valley
i
could
perceive
not
far
from
the
spot
where
we
sat
a
female
figure
veiled
and
crouching
to
earth
as
if
subdued
by
sorrow
or
under
the
influence
of
shame
the
light
by
which
i
saw
her
was
from
a
pale
meteor
which
had
formed
itself
in
the
air
as
the
music
approached
and
shed
over
the
rocks
and
the
lake
a
glimmer
as
cold
as
that
by
which
the
dead
in
their
own
realm
gaze
on
each
other
the
music
too
which
appeared
to
rise
directly
out
of
the
lake
and
to
come
full
of
the
breath
of
its
dark
waters
spoke
a
despondency
in
every
note
which
no
language
could
express
as
i
listened
to
its
tones
and
looked
upon
that
fallen
spirit
for
such
the
holy
man
whispered
was
the
form
before
us
so
entirely
did
the
illusion
of
the
scene
take
possession
of
me
that
with
breathless
anxiety
i
waited
the
result
nor
had
i
gazed
long
before
that
form
rose
slowly
from
its
drooping
position
air
around
it
grew
bright
and
the
pale
meteor
overhead
assumed
a
more
cheerful
and
living
light
the
veil
which
had
before
shrouded
the
face
of
the
figure
became
gradually
transparent
and
the
features
one
by
one
disclosed
themselves
through
it
having
tremblingly
watched
the
progress
of
the
apparition
i
now
started
from
my
seat
and
half
exclaimed
is
she
in
another
minute
this
veil
had
like
a
thin
mist
melted
away
and
the
young
priestess
of
the
moon
stood
for
the
third
time
revealed
before
my
eyes
to
rush
instantly
towards
her
was
my
first
the
arm
of
the
priest
held
me
firmly
back
the
fresh
light
which
had
begun
to
flow
in
from
all
sides
collected
itself
in
a
glory
round
the
spot
where
she
stood
instead
of
melancholy
music
strains
of
the
most
exalted
rapture
were
heard
and
the
young
maiden
buoyant
as
the
inhabitants
of
the
fairy
orb
amid
a
blaze
of
light
like
that
which
fell
upon
her
in
the
temple
ascended
into
the
air
beautiful
vision
stay
i
exclaimed
as
breaking
from
the
hold
of
the
priest
i
flung
myself
prostrate
on
the
ground
only
mode
by
which
i
could
express
the
admiration
even
to
worship
with
which
i
was
filled
but
the
vanishing
spirit
heard
me
not
into
the
darkness
like
that
orb
whose
track
she
seemed
to
follow
her
form
lessened
away
till
she
was
seen
no
more
gazing
till
the
last
luminous
speck
had
disappeared
i
suffered
myself
unconsciously
to
be
led
away
by
my
reverend
guide
who
placing
me
once
more
on
my
bed
of
left
me
to
such
repose
as
it
was
possible
after
such
a
scene
to
enjoy
chap
x
the
apparition
with
which
i
had
been
blessed
in
that
valley
of
the
place
where
i
had
witnessed
these
wonders
was
back
to
my
heart
all
the
hopes
and
fancies
in
which
i
had
indulged
during
my
descent
from
earth
i
had
now
seen
once
more
that
matchless
creature
who
had
been
my
guiding
star
into
this
mysterious
world
and
that
she
was
in
some
way
connected
with
the
further
revelations
that
awaited
me
i
saw
no
reason
to
doubt
there
was
a
sublimity
too
in
the
doctrines
of
my
reverend
teacher
and
even
a
hope
in
the
promises
of
immortality
held
out
by
him
which
in
spite
of
reason
won
insensibly
both
upon
my
fancy
and
my
pride
the
future
however
was
now
but
of
secondary
consideration
present
and
that
deity
of
the
present
woman
were
the
objects
that
engrossed
my
whole
soul
for
the
sake
indeed
of
such
beings
alone
did
i
think
immortality
desirable
nor
without
them
would
eternal
life
have
appeared
to
me
worth
a
prayer
to
every
further
trial
of
my
patience
and
faith
i
now
made
up
my
mind
to
submit
without
a
murmur
some
propitious
chance
i
fondly
persuaded
myself
might
yet
bring
me
nearer
to
the
object
of
my
adoration
and
enable
me
to
address
as
mortal
woman
her
who
had
hitherto
been
to
me
but
as
a
vision
a
shade
the
period
of
my
probation
however
was
nearly
at
an
end
both
frame
and
spirit
had
now
been
tried
and
as
the
crowning
test
of
the
purification
of
the
latter
was
that
power
of
seeing
into
the
world
of
spirits
with
which
in
the
valley
of
visions
i
had
proved
myself
to
be
endowed
there
remained
now
to
perfect
my
initiation
but
this
one
night
more
when
in
the
temple
of
isis
and
in
the
presence
of
her
unveiled
image
the
last
grand
revelation
of
the
secret
of
secrets
was
to
open
upon
me
i
passed
the
morning
of
this
day
in
company
with
the
same
venerable
personage
who
had
from
the
first
presided
over
the
ceremonies
of
my
instruction
and
who
to
inspire
me
with
due
reverence
for
the
power
and
magnificence
of
his
religion
now
conducted
me
through
the
long
range
of
illuminated
galleries
and
shrines
that
extend
under
the
site
upon
which
memphis
and
the
pyramids
stand
and
form
a
counterpart
under
ground
to
that
mighty
city
of
temples
upon
earth
he
then
descended
with
me
still
lower
into
those
winding
crypts
where
lay
the
seven
tables
of
stone
found
by
hermes
in
the
valley
of
hebron
these
tables
said
he
written
all
the
knowledge
of
the
antediluvian
race
decrees
of
the
stars
from
the
beginning
of
time
the
annals
of
a
still
earlier
world
and
all
the
marvellous
secrets
both
of
heaven
and
earth
which
would
have
been
for
this
key
lost
in
the
universal
returning
to
the
region
from
which
we
had
descended
we
next
visited
in
succession
a
series
of
small
shrines
representing
the
various
objects
of
adoration
through
egypt
and
thus
furnishing
to
the
priest
an
occasion
for
explaining
the
mysterious
nature
of
animal
worship
and
the
refined
doctrines
of
theology
that
lay
veiled
under
its
forms
every
shrine
was
consecrated
to
a
particular
faith
and
contained
a
living
image
of
the
deity
which
it
adored
beside
the
goat
of
mendes
with
his
refulgent
star
upon
his
breast
i
saw
the
crocodile
as
presented
to
the
eyes
of
its
idolaters
at
arsinoë
with
costly
gems
in
its
loathsome
ears
and
rich
bracelets
of
gold
encircling
its
feet
here
floating
through
a
tank
in
the
centre
of
a
temple
the
sacred
carp
of
lepidotum
exhibited
its
silvery
scales
while
there
the
isiac
serpents
trailed
languidly
over
the
altar
with
that
movement
which
most
inspires
the
hopes
of
their
votaries
in
one
of
the
small
chapels
we
found
a
beautiful
child
feeding
and
watching
over
those
golden
beetles
which
are
adored
for
their
brightness
as
emblems
of
the
sun
while
in
another
stood
a
sacred
ibis
upon
its
pedestal
so
like
in
plumage
and
attitude
to
the
bird
of
the
young
priestess
that
i
could
gladly
have
knelt
down
and
worshipped
it
for
her
sake
after
visiting
these
various
shrines
and
listening
to
the
reflections
which
they
suggested
i
was
next
led
by
my
guide
to
the
great
hall
of
the
zodiac
on
whose
ceiling
in
bright
and
undying
colours
was
delineated
the
map
of
the
firmament
as
it
appeared
at
the
first
dawn
of
time
here
in
pointing
out
the
track
of
the
sun
among
the
spheres
he
spoke
eloquently
of
the
analogy
that
exists
between
moral
and
physical
the
sympathy
with
which
all
spiritual
creatures
regard
the
sun
so
as
to
sadden
and
droop
when
he
sinks
into
his
wintry
hemisphere
and
to
rejoice
when
he
resumes
his
own
empire
of
light
hence
the
festivals
and
hymns
with
which
most
of
the
nations
of
the
earth
are
wont
to
welcome
the
resurrection
of
his
orb
in
spring
as
an
emblem
and
pledge
of
the
of
the
soul
to
heaven
hence
the
songs
of
sorrow
the
mournful
ceremonies
those
mysteries
of
the
night
upon
the
lake
of
saïs
which
they
brood
over
his
autumnal
descent
into
the
shades
as
a
type
of
the
fall
into
this
world
of
death
in
discourses
such
as
these
the
hours
passed
away
and
though
there
was
nothing
in
the
light
of
this
sunless
region
to
mark
to
the
eye
the
decline
of
day
my
own
feelings
told
me
that
the
night
drew
near
in
spite
of
my
incredulity
could
i
refrain
from
a
flutter
of
hope
as
that
promised
moment
of
revelation
approached
when
the
mystery
of
mysteries
was
to
be
made
all
my
own
this
consummation
however
was
less
near
than
i
expected
my
patience
had
still
further
trials
to
encounter
it
was
necessary
i
now
found
that
i
should
keep
watch
during
the
greater
part
of
the
night
in
the
sanctuary
of
the
temple
alone
and
in
darkness
thus
prepare
myself
by
meditation
for
the
awful
moment
when
the
irradiation
from
behind
the
sacred
veils
was
to
burst
upon
me
at
the
appointed
hour
we
left
the
hall
of
the
zodiac
and
proceeded
through
a
line
of
long
marble
galleries
where
the
lamps
were
more
thinly
scattered
as
we
advanced
till
at
length
we
found
ourselves
in
total
darkness
here
the
priest
taking
me
by
the
hand
and
leading
me
down
a
flight
of
steps
into
a
place
where
the
same
deep
gloom
prevailed
said
with
a
voice
trembling
as
if
from
excess
of
awe
art
now
in
the
sanctuary
of
our
goddess
isis
and
the
dark
veils
that
hang
over
her
image
are
before
thee
after
exhorting
me
earnestly
to
that
train
of
thought
which
best
accorded
with
the
spirit
of
the
place
where
i
stood
and
above
all
to
that
full
and
unhesitating
faith
with
which
alone
he
said
the
manifestation
of
such
mysteries
should
be
approached
the
holy
man
took
leave
of
me
and
the
steps
so
did
i
feel
by
that
deep
darkness
that
the
last
sound
of
his
footsteps
died
upon
my
ear
before
i
ventured
to
stir
a
limb
from
the
position
in
which
he
had
left
me
the
prospect
of
the
long
watch
now
before
me
was
dreadful
even
danger
itself
in
an
active
form
would
have
been
preferable
to
this
sort
of
safe
but
dull
probation
by
which
patience
was
the
only
virtue
put
to
the
proof
having
ascertained
how
far
the
space
around
me
was
free
from
obstacles
i
endeavoured
to
beguile
the
time
by
pacing
up
and
down
within
those
limits
till
i
became
tired
of
the
echoes
of
my
own
tread
finding
my
way
then
to
what
i
felt
to
be
a
massive
pillar
and
leaning
wearily
against
it
i
surrendered
myself
to
a
train
of
thoughts
and
feelings
far
different
from
those
with
which
the
hierophant
had
hoped
to
inspire
me
i
again
asked
these
priests
possess
the
secret
of
life
why
are
they
themselves
the
victims
of
death
why
sink
into
the
grave
with
the
cup
of
immortality
in
their
hands
but
no
safe
boasters
the
eternity
they
so
lavishly
promise
is
reserved
for
a
future
ready
resource
of
all
priestly
depository
of
the
airy
pledges
of
all
creeds
another
world
where
does
it
lie
or
what
spirit
hath
ever
come
to
say
that
life
is
there
the
conclusion
to
which
half
sadly
half
passionately
i
arrived
was
that
life
being
but
a
dream
of
the
moment
never
to
come
again
every
bliss
that
is
promised
for
hereafter
should
be
secured
by
the
wise
man
here
and
as
no
heaven
i
had
ever
heard
of
from
these
visionary
priests
opened
half
such
certainty
of
happiness
as
that
smile
which
i
beheld
last
night
me
i
exclaimed
impatiently
striking
the
massy
pillar
till
it
rung
me
but
make
that
beautiful
priestess
my
own
and
i
here
willingly
exchange
for
her
every
chance
of
immortality
that
the
combined
wisdom
of
twelve
temples
can
offer
me
no
sooner
had
i
uttered
these
words
than
a
tremendous
peal
like
that
of
thunder
rolled
over
the
sanctuary
and
seemed
to
shake
its
walls
on
every
side
too
a
succession
of
blue
vivid
flashes
pierced
like
so
many
lances
of
light
through
the
gloom
revealing
to
me
at
intervals
the
mighty
dome
in
which
i
ceiling
of
azure
studded
with
stars
its
colossal
columns
towering
aloft
and
those
dark
mysterious
veils
which
hung
in
massy
drapery
from
the
roof
to
the
floor
and
covered
the
rich
glories
of
the
shrine
under
their
folds
so
weary
had
i
grown
of
my
tedious
watch
that
this
stormy
and
fitful
illumination
during
which
the
sanctuary
seemed
to
rock
to
its
base
was
by
no
means
an
unwelcome
interruption
of
the
monotony
under
which
my
impatience
suffered
after
a
short
interval
however
the
flashes
ceased
sounds
died
away
like
exhausted
thunder
through
the
abyss
and
darkness
and
silence
like
that
of
the
grave
succeeded
resting
my
back
once
more
against
the
pillar
and
fixing
my
eyes
upon
that
side
of
the
sanctuary
from
which
the
promised
irradiation
was
to
burst
i
now
resolved
to
await
the
awful
moment
in
patience
resigned
and
immovable
i
had
remained
thus
for
nearly
another
hour
when
suddenly
along
the
edges
of
the
mighty
veils
i
perceived
a
thin
rim
of
light
as
if
from
some
brilliant
object
under
them
that
border
which
encircles
a
cloud
at
sunset
when
the
radiance
from
behind
is
escaping
at
its
edges
this
indication
of
concealed
glories
grew
every
instant
more
strong
till
at
last
vividly
marked
as
it
was
upon
the
darkness
the
narrow
fringe
of
lustre
almost
pained
the
eye
giving
promise
of
a
splendour
too
bright
to
be
endured
my
expectations
were
now
wound
to
the
highest
pitch
and
all
the
scepticism
into
which
i
had
been
cooling
down
my
mind
was
forgotten
the
wonders
that
had
been
presented
to
me
since
my
descent
from
glimpse
into
elysium
on
the
first
night
of
my
visitants
from
the
land
of
spirits
in
the
mysterious
valley
led
me
to
expect
in
this
last
and
brightest
revelation
such
visions
of
glory
and
knowledge
as
might
transcend
even
fancy
itself
nor
leave
a
doubt
that
they
belonged
less
to
earth
than
heaven
while
with
an
imagination
thus
excited
i
stood
waiting
the
result
an
increased
gush
of
light
still
more
awakened
my
attention
and
i
saw
with
an
intenseness
of
interest
which
made
my
heart
beat
aloud
one
of
the
corners
of
the
mighty
veil
slowly
raised
up
i
now
felt
that
the
great
it
might
at
hand
a
vague
hope
even
crossed
my
wholly
had
imagination
resumed
her
the
splendid
promise
of
my
dream
was
on
the
point
of
being
realised
with
surprise
however
a
disappointment
i
perceived
that
the
massy
corner
of
the
veil
was
but
raised
sufficiently
to
allow
a
female
figure
to
emerge
from
under
it
then
fell
again
over
its
mystic
splendours
as
dark
as
before
by
the
strong
light
too
that
issued
when
the
drapery
was
lifted
and
illuminated
the
profile
of
the
emerging
figure
i
either
saw
or
fancied
that
i
saw
the
same
bright
features
that
had
already
mocked
me
so
often
with
their
momentary
charm
and
seemed
destined
to
haunt
my
heart
as
unavailingly
as
the
fond
vain
dream
of
immortality
itself
dazzled
as
i
had
been
by
that
short
gush
of
splendour
and
distrusting
even
my
senses
when
under
the
influence
of
a
fancy
so
excited
i
had
hardly
time
to
question
myself
as
to
the
reality
of
my
impression
when
i
heard
the
sounds
of
light
footsteps
approaching
me
through
the
gloom
in
a
second
or
two
more
the
figure
stopped
before
me
and
placing
the
end
of
a
riband
gently
in
my
hand
said
in
a
tremulous
whisper
and
be
so
sudden
and
strange
was
the
adventure
that
for
a
moment
i
hesitated
lest
my
eyes
should
have
been
deceived
as
to
the
object
they
had
seen
casting
a
look
towards
the
veil
which
seemed
bursting
with
its
luminous
secret
i
was
almost
doubting
to
which
of
the
two
chances
i
should
commit
myself
when
i
felt
the
riband
in
my
hand
pulled
softly
at
the
other
extremity
this
movement
at
once
like
a
touch
of
magic
decided
me
without
further
deliberation
i
yielded
to
the
silent
summons
and
following
my
guide
who
was
already
at
some
distance
before
me
found
myself
led
up
the
same
flight
of
marble
steps
by
which
the
priest
had
conducted
me
into
the
sanctuary
arrived
at
their
summit
i
felt
the
pace
of
my
conductress
quicken
and
giving
one
more
look
to
the
veiled
shrine
whose
glories
we
left
burning
ineffectually
behind
us
hastened
into
the
gloom
full
of
confidence
in
the
belief
that
she
who
now
held
the
other
end
of
that
clue
was
one
whom
i
could
follow
devotedly
through
the
world
chap
xi
so
rapidly
was
i
hurried
along
by
my
unseen
conductress
full
of
wonder
at
the
speed
with
which
she
ventured
through
these
labyrinths
that
i
had
but
little
time
to
reflect
upon
the
strangeness
of
the
adventure
to
which
i
had
committed
myself
my
knowledge
of
the
character
of
the
priests
as
well
as
the
fearful
rumours
that
had
reached
me
of
the
fate
that
often
attended
unbelievers
in
their
hands
waked
a
momentary
suspicion
of
treachery
in
my
mind
but
when
i
recalled
the
face
of
my
guide
as
i
had
seen
it
in
the
chapel
with
that
divine
look
the
very
memory
of
which
brought
purity
into
the
heart
this
suspicion
all
vanished
and
i
felt
shame
at
having
harboured
it
but
an
instant
in
the
mean
while
our
course
continued
uninterrupted
through
windings
more
capriciously
intricate
than
any
that
i
had
yet
passed
and
whose
darkness
seemed
never
to
have
been
disturbed
by
a
single
glimmer
my
conductress
still
continued
at
some
distance
before
me
and
the
clue
to
which
i
clung
as
if
it
were
the
thread
of
destiny
herself
was
still
kept
by
her
speed
at
full
stretch
between
us
at
length
suddenly
stopping
she
said
in
a
breathless
whisper
thyself
here
and
at
the
same
moment
led
me
by
the
hand
to
a
sort
of
low
car
in
which
i
lost
not
a
moment
in
placing
myself
as
desired
while
the
maiden
as
promptly
took
her
seat
by
my
side
a
sudden
click
like
the
touching
of
a
spring
was
then
heard
and
the
car
as
i
had
felt
in
entering
it
leaned
over
a
steep
descent
being
loosed
from
its
station
shot
down
almost
perpendicularly
into
the
darkness
with
a
rapidity
which
at
first
nearly
deprived
me
of
breath
the
wheels
slid
smoothly
and
noiselessly
in
grooves
and
the
impetus
which
the
car
acquired
in
descending
was
sufficient
i
perceived
to
carry
it
up
an
eminence
that
succeeded
the
summit
of
which
it
again
rushed
down
another
declivity
even
still
more
long
and
precipitous
than
the
former
in
this
manner
we
proceeded
by
alternate
falls
and
rises
till
at
length
from
the
last
and
steepest
elevation
the
car
descended
upon
a
level
of
deep
sand
where
after
running
for
a
few
yards
it
by
degrees
lost
its
motion
and
stopped
here
the
maiden
alighting
again
placed
the
riband
in
my
hands
again
i
followed
her
though
with
more
slowness
and
difficulty
than
before
as
our
way
led
up
a
flight
of
damp
and
steps
whose
ascent
seemed
to
the
weary
and
insecure
foot
interminable
perceiving
with
what
languor
my
guide
now
advanced
i
was
on
the
point
of
making
an
effort
to
assist
her
progress
when
the
creak
of
an
opening
door
above
and
a
faint
gleam
of
light
which
at
the
same
moment
shone
upon
her
figure
apprised
me
that
we
were
arrived
within
reach
of
sunshine
joyfully
i
followed
through
this
opening
and
by
the
dim
light
could
discern
that
we
were
now
in
the
sanctuary
of
a
vast
ruined
temple
entered
by
a
passage
under
the
lofty
pedestal
upon
which
an
image
of
the
idol
of
the
place
once
stood
the
first
movement
of
the
maiden
after
replacing
the
portal
under
the
pedestal
was
without
even
a
look
towards
me
to
cast
herself
down
on
her
knees
with
her
hands
clasped
and
uplifted
as
if
for
the
purpose
of
thanksgiving
or
prayer
but
she
was
unable
to
sustain
herself
in
this
position
strength
could
hold
out
no
longer
overcome
by
agitation
and
fatigue
she
sunk
senseless
upon
the
pavement
bewildered
as
i
was
myself
by
the
events
of
the
night
i
stood
for
some
minutes
looking
upon
her
in
a
state
of
helplessness
and
alarm
but
reminded
by
my
own
feverish
sensations
of
the
reviving
effects
of
the
air
i
raised
her
gently
in
my
arms
and
crossing
the
corridor
that
surrounded
the
sanctuary
found
my
way
to
the
outer
vestibule
of
the
temple
here
shading
her
eyes
from
the
sun
i
placed
her
reclining
upon
the
steps
where
the
cool
wind
then
blowing
freshly
from
the
north
might
play
with
free
draught
between
the
pillars
over
her
brow
it
was
indeed
now
saw
with
certainty
same
beautiful
and
mysterious
girl
who
had
been
the
cause
of
my
descent
into
that
subterranean
world
and
who
now
under
such
strange
and
unaccountable
circumstances
was
my
guide
back
again
to
the
realms
of
day
i
looked
round
to
discover
where
we
were
and
beheld
such
a
scene
of
grandeur
my
eyes
have
wandered
to
any
other
object
from
the
pale
form
reclining
at
my
well
have
won
them
to
dwell
on
its
splendid
beauties
i
was
now
standing
i
found
on
the
small
island
in
the
centre
of
lake
mœris
and
that
sanctuary
where
we
had
emerged
from
darkness
formed
part
of
the
ruins
of
a
temple
which
as
i
have
since
learned
was
in
the
grander
days
of
memphis
a
place
of
pilgrimage
for
worshippers
from
all
parts
of
egypt
the
fair
lake
itself
out
of
whose
waters
once
rose
pavilions
palaces
and
even
lofty
pyramids
was
still
though
divested
of
many
of
these
wonders
a
scene
of
interest
and
splendour
such
as
the
whole
world
could
not
equal
while
the
shores
still
sparkled
with
mansions
and
temples
that
bore
testimony
to
the
luxury
of
a
living
race
the
voice
of
the
past
speaking
out
of
unnumbered
ruins
whose
summits
here
and
there
rose
blackly
above
the
wave
told
of
times
long
fled
and
generations
long
swept
away
before
whose
giant
remains
all
the
glory
of
the
present
stood
humbled
over
the
southern
bank
of
the
lake
hung
the
dark
relics
of
the
labyrinth
twelve
royal
palaces
like
the
mansions
of
the
zodiac
thundering
portals
and
constellated
halls
having
left
nothing
behind
but
a
few
frowning
ruins
which
contrasted
with
the
soft
groves
of
olive
and
acacia
around
them
seemed
to
rebuke
the
luxuriant
smiles
of
nature
and
threw
a
melancholy
grandeur
over
the
whole
scene
the
effects
of
the
air
in
the
young
priestess
were
less
speedy
than
i
had
expected
eyes
were
still
closed
and
she
remained
pale
and
insensible
alarmed
i
now
rested
her
head
which
had
been
for
some
time
supported
by
my
arm
against
the
base
of
a
column
with
my
cloak
for
its
pillow
while
i
hastened
to
procure
some
water
from
the
lake
the
temple
stood
high
and
the
descent
to
the
shore
was
precipitous
but
my
epicurean
habits
having
but
little
impaired
my
activity
i
soon
descended
with
the
lightness
of
a
desert
deer
to
the
bottom
here
plucking
from
a
lofty
whose
flowers
stood
shining
like
gold
above
the
water
one
of
those
large
hollowed
leaves
that
serve
as
cups
for
the
hebes
of
the
nile
i
filled
it
from
the
lake
and
hurried
back
with
the
cool
draught
to
the
temple
it
was
not
without
some
difficulty
and
delay
that
i
succeeded
in
bearing
my
rustic
chalice
steadily
up
the
steep
more
than
once
did
an
unlucky
slip
waste
its
contents
and
as
often
did
i
impatiently
return
to
refill
it
during
this
time
the
young
maiden
was
fast
recovering
her
animation
and
consciousness
and
at
the
moment
when
i
appeared
above
the
edge
of
the
steep
was
just
rising
from
the
steps
with
her
hand
pressed
to
her
forehead
as
if
confusedly
recalling
the
recollection
of
what
had
occurred
no
sooner
did
she
observe
me
than
a
short
cry
of
alarm
broke
from
her
lips
looking
anxiously
round
as
though
she
sought
for
protection
and
half
audibly
uttering
the
words
is
he
she
made
an
effort
as
i
approached
to
retreat
into
the
temple
already
however
i
was
by
her
side
and
taking
her
hand
gently
as
she
turned
away
dost
thou
seek
fair
priestess
i
asked
the
first
time
breaking
through
the
silence
she
had
enjoined
and
in
a
tone
that
might
have
the
most
timid
spirit
but
my
words
had
no
effect
in
calming
her
apprehension
trembling
and
with
her
eyes
still
averted
towards
the
temple
she
continued
in
a
voice
of
suppressed
alarm
he
be
venerable
athenian
that
philosopher
here
i
exclaimed
anxiously
interrupting
her
him
still
by
thy
same
the
very
same
who
saw
thee
steal
from
under
the
lighted
veils
of
the
sanctuary
whom
thou
hast
guided
by
a
clue
through
those
labyrinths
below
and
who
now
but
waits
his
command
from
those
lips
to
devote
himself
through
life
and
death
to
thy
as
i
spoke
these
words
she
turned
slowly
round
and
looking
timidly
in
my
face
while
her
own
burned
with
blushes
said
in
a
tone
of
doubt
and
wonder
and
hid
her
eyes
in
her
hands
i
knew
not
how
to
interpret
a
reception
so
unexpected
that
some
mistake
or
disappointment
had
occurred
was
evident
but
so
inexplicable
did
the
whole
adventure
appear
that
it
was
in
vain
to
think
of
unravelling
any
part
of
it
weak
and
agitated
she
now
tottered
to
the
steps
of
the
temple
and
there
seating
herself
with
her
forehead
against
the
cold
marble
seemed
for
some
moments
absorbed
in
the
most
anxious
thought
silent
and
watchful
i
waited
her
decision
with
a
prophetic
feeling
however
that
my
destiny
would
be
henceforth
linked
with
hers
the
inward
struggle
by
which
she
was
agitated
though
violent
was
not
of
long
continuance
starting
suddenly
from
her
seat
with
a
look
of
terror
towards
the
temple
as
if
the
fear
of
immediate
pursuit
had
alone
decided
her
she
pointed
eagerly
towards
the
east
and
exclaimed
the
nile
without
delay
her
hands
when
she
had
spoken
with
the
most
suppliant
fervour
as
if
to
soften
the
abruptness
of
the
mandate
she
had
given
and
appealing
to
me
with
a
look
that
would
have
taught
stoics
tenderness
i
lost
no
time
in
obeying
the
welcome
command
while
a
thousand
wild
hopes
and
wishes
crowded
upon
my
fancy
at
the
prospect
which
a
voyage
under
such
auspices
presented
i
descended
rapidly
to
the
shore
and
hailing
one
of
the
numerous
boats
that
ply
upon
the
lake
for
hire
arranged
speedily
for
a
passage
down
the
canal
to
the
nile
having
learned
too
from
the
boatmen
a
more
easy
path
up
the
rock
i
hastened
back
to
the
temple
for
my
fair
charge
and
without
a
word
a
look
that
could
alarm
even
by
its
kindness
or
disturb
that
innocent
confidence
which
she
now
placed
in
me
led
her
down
by
the
winding
path
to
the
boat
every
thing
looked
smiling
around
us
as
we
embarked
the
morning
was
now
in
its
first
freshness
and
the
path
of
the
breeze
might
be
traced
over
the
lake
wakening
up
its
waters
from
their
sleep
of
the
night
the
gay
birds
that
haunt
these
shores
were
in
every
direction
skimming
along
the
lake
while
with
a
graver
consciousness
of
beauty
the
swan
and
the
pelican
were
seen
dressing
their
white
plumage
in
the
mirror
of
its
wave
to
add
to
the
animation
of
the
scene
a
sweet
tinkling
of
musical
instruments
came
at
intervals
on
the
breeze
from
boats
at
a
distance
employed
thus
early
in
pursuing
the
fish
of
these
waters
that
suffer
themselves
to
be
decoyed
into
the
nets
by
music
the
vessel
which
i
selected
for
our
voyage
was
one
of
those
small
or
yachts
much
in
use
among
the
luxurious
navigators
of
the
nile
the
centre
of
which
rises
a
pavilion
of
cedar
or
cypress
wood
gilded
gorgeously
without
with
religious
emblems
and
fitted
up
within
for
all
the
purposes
of
feasting
and
repose
to
the
door
of
this
pavilion
i
now
led
my
companion
and
after
a
few
words
of
with
as
much
respectful
reserve
as
the
deep
tenderness
which
i
felt
would
admit
her
in
solitude
to
court
that
restoring
rest
which
the
agitation
of
her
spirits
but
too
much
required
for
myself
though
repose
was
hardly
less
necessary
to
me
the
ferment
in
which
my
thoughts
had
been
kept
seemed
to
render
it
hopeless
throwing
myself
upon
the
deck
under
an
awning
which
the
sailors
had
raised
for
me
i
continued
for
some
hours
in
a
sort
of
vague
passing
in
review
the
scenes
of
that
subterranean
drama
and
sometimes
with
my
eyes
fixed
in
drowsy
vacancy
receiving
passively
the
impressions
of
the
bright
scenery
through
which
we
passed
the
banks
of
the
canal
were
then
luxuriantly
wooded
under
the
tufts
of
the
light
and
towering
palm
were
seen
the
orange
and
the
citron
interlacing
their
boughs
while
here
and
there
huge
tamarisks
thickened
the
shade
and
at
the
very
edge
of
the
bank
the
willow
of
babylon
stood
bending
its
graceful
branches
into
the
water
occasionally
out
of
the
depth
of
these
groves
there
shone
a
small
temple
or
house
now
and
then
an
opening
in
their
line
of
foliage
allowed
the
eye
to
wander
over
extensive
fields
all
covered
with
beds
of
those
pale
sweet
roses
for
which
this
district
of
egypt
is
so
celebrated
the
activity
of
the
morning
hour
was
visible
every
where
flights
of
doves
and
lapwings
were
fluttering
among
the
leaves
and
the
white
heron
which
had
roosted
all
night
in
some
now
stood
sunning
its
wings
upon
the
green
bank
or
floated
like
living
silver
over
the
flood
the
flowers
too
both
of
land
and
water
looked
freshly
awakened
most
of
all
the
superb
lotus
which
had
risen
with
the
sun
from
the
wave
and
was
now
holding
up
her
chalice
for
a
full
draught
of
his
light
such
were
the
scenes
that
now
passed
before
my
eyes
and
mingled
with
the
reveries
that
floated
through
my
mind
as
our
boat
with
its
high
capacious
sail
swept
over
the
flood
though
the
occurrences
of
the
last
few
days
appeared
to
me
one
series
of
wonders
yet
by
far
the
most
miraculous
wonder
of
all
was
that
she
whose
first
look
had
sent
fire
into
my
heart
i
had
thought
of
ever
since
with
a
restlessness
of
passion
that
would
have
dared
any
thing
on
earth
to
obtain
its
object
now
sleeping
sacredly
in
that
small
pavilion
while
guarding
her
even
from
myself
i
lay
calmly
at
its
threshold
meanwhile
the
sun
had
reached
his
meridian
the
busy
hum
of
the
morning
had
died
gradually
away
and
all
around
was
sleeping
in
the
hot
stillness
of
noon
the
folding
her
splendid
wings
was
lying
motionless
on
the
shadow
of
the
sycamores
in
the
water
even
the
nimble
lizards
upon
the
bank
seemed
to
move
more
languidly
as
the
light
fell
upon
their
gold
and
azure
hues
overcome
as
i
was
with
watching
and
weary
with
thought
it
was
not
long
before
i
yielded
to
the
becalming
influence
of
the
hour
looking
fixedly
at
the
pavilion
if
once
more
to
assure
my
senses
that
i
was
not
already
in
a
dream
but
that
the
young
egyptian
was
really
there
felt
my
eyes
close
as
i
looked
and
in
a
few
minutes
sunk
into
a
profound
sleep
chap
xii
it
was
by
the
canal
through
which
we
now
sailed
that
in
the
more
prosperous
days
of
memphis
the
commerce
of
upper
egypt
and
nubia
was
transported
to
her
magnificent
lake
and
from
thence
having
paid
tribute
to
the
queen
of
cities
was
poured
out
again
through
the
nile
into
the
ocean
the
course
of
this
canal
to
the
river
was
not
direct
but
ascending
in
a
direction
towards
the
saïd
and
in
calms
or
with
adverse
winds
the
passage
was
tedious
but
as
the
breeze
was
now
blowing
freshly
from
the
north
there
was
every
prospect
of
our
reaching
the
river
before
rapidly
too
as
our
galley
swept
along
the
flood
its
motion
was
so
smooth
as
to
be
hardly
felt
and
the
quiet
gurgle
of
the
waters
underneath
and
the
drowsy
song
of
the
boatman
at
the
prow
alone
disturbed
the
deep
silence
that
prevailed
the
sun
indeed
had
nearly
sunk
behind
the
libyan
hills
before
the
sleep
in
which
these
sounds
lulled
me
was
broken
and
the
first
object
on
which
my
eyes
rested
in
waking
was
that
fair
young
priestess
under
a
porch
by
which
the
door
of
the
pavilion
was
shaded
and
bending
intently
over
a
small
volume
that
lay
unrolled
on
her
lap
her
face
was
but
half
turned
towards
me
and
as
once
or
twice
she
raised
her
eyes
to
the
warm
sky
whose
light
fell
softened
through
the
trellis
over
her
cheek
i
found
every
feeling
of
reverence
with
which
she
had
inspired
me
in
the
chapel
return
there
was
even
a
purer
and
holier
charm
around
her
countenance
thus
seen
by
the
natural
light
of
day
than
in
those
dim
and
unhallowed
regions
below
she
could
now
too
look
direct
to
the
glorious
sky
and
that
heaven
and
her
eyes
so
worthy
of
each
other
met
after
contemplating
her
for
a
few
moments
with
little
less
than
adoration
i
rose
gently
from
my
and
approached
the
pavilion
but
the
mere
movement
had
startled
her
from
her
devotion
and
blushing
and
confused
she
covered
the
volume
with
the
folds
of
her
robe
in
the
art
of
winning
upon
female
confidence
i
had
long
been
schooled
and
now
that
to
the
lessons
of
gallantry
the
inspiration
of
love
was
added
my
ambition
to
please
and
to
interest
could
hardly
it
may
be
supposed
fail
of
success
i
soon
found
however
how
much
less
fluent
is
the
heart
than
the
fancy
and
how
very
distinct
are
the
operations
of
making
love
and
feeling
it
in
the
few
words
of
greeting
now
exchanged
between
us
it
was
evident
that
the
gay
the
enterprising
epicurean
was
little
less
embarrassed
than
the
secluded
priestess
after
one
or
two
ineffectual
efforts
to
bring
our
voices
acquainted
with
each
other
the
eyes
of
both
turned
bashfully
away
and
we
relapsed
into
silence
from
this
result
of
timidity
on
one
side
and
of
a
feeling
altogether
new
on
the
were
at
length
after
an
interval
of
estrangement
relieved
by
the
boatmen
announcing
that
the
nile
was
in
sight
the
countenance
of
the
young
egyptian
brightened
at
this
intelligence
and
the
smile
with
which
i
congratulated
her
on
the
speed
of
our
voyage
was
answered
by
another
so
full
of
gratitude
that
already
an
instinctive
sympathy
seemed
established
between
us
we
were
now
on
the
point
of
entering
that
sacred
river
of
whose
sweet
waters
the
exile
drinks
in
his
dreams
a
draught
of
whose
flood
the
daughters
of
the
ptolemies
when
wedded
to
foreign
kings
sighed
in
the
midst
of
their
splendour
as
our
boat
with
slackened
sail
glided
into
the
current
an
enquiry
from
the
boatmen
whether
they
should
anchor
for
the
night
in
the
nile
first
reminded
me
of
the
ignorance
in
which
i
still
remained
with
respect
to
either
the
motive
or
destination
of
our
voyage
embarrassed
by
their
question
i
directed
my
eyes
towards
the
priestess
whom
i
saw
waiting
for
my
answer
with
a
look
of
anxiety
which
this
silent
reference
to
her
wishes
at
once
dispelled
eagerly
unfolding
the
volume
with
which
i
had
seen
her
occupied
she
took
from
its
folds
a
small
leaf
of
papyrus
on
which
there
appeared
to
be
some
faint
lines
of
drawing
and
after
thoughtfully
looking
upon
it
herself
for
a
moment
placed
it
with
an
agitated
hand
in
mine
in
the
mean
time
the
boatmen
had
taken
in
their
sail
and
the
yacht
drove
slowly
down
the
river
with
the
current
while
by
a
light
which
had
been
kindled
at
sunset
on
the
deck
i
stood
examining
the
leaf
that
the
priestess
had
given
me
dark
eyes
fixed
anxiously
on
my
countenance
all
the
while
the
lines
traced
upon
the
papyrus
were
so
faint
as
to
be
almost
invisible
and
i
was
for
some
time
at
a
loss
to
divine
their
import
at
length
i
could
perceive
that
they
were
the
outlines
or
slightly
and
unsteadily
with
a
memphian
a
part
of
that
mountainous
ridge
by
which
upper
egypt
is
bounded
to
the
east
together
with
the
names
or
rather
emblems
of
the
chief
towns
in
the
neighbourhood
it
was
thither
i
could
not
doubt
that
the
young
priestess
wished
to
pursue
her
course
without
a
delay
therefore
i
gave
orders
to
the
boatmen
to
set
our
yacht
before
the
wind
and
ascend
the
current
my
command
was
promptly
obeyed
the
white
sail
again
rose
into
the
region
of
the
breeze
and
the
satisfaction
that
beamed
in
every
feature
of
the
fair
egyptian
showed
that
the
quickness
with
which
i
had
obeyed
her
wishes
was
not
unfelt
by
her
the
moon
had
now
risen
and
though
the
current
was
against
us
the
etesian
wind
of
the
season
blew
strongly
up
the
river
and
we
were
soon
floating
before
it
through
the
rich
plains
and
groves
of
the
saïd
the
love
with
which
this
simple
girl
had
inspired
me
from
the
mystic
scenes
and
situations
in
which
i
had
seen
unmingled
with
a
tinge
of
superstitious
awe
under
the
influence
of
which
i
felt
the
buoyancy
of
my
spirit
checked
the
few
words
that
had
passed
between
us
on
the
subject
of
our
route
had
somewhat
loosened
this
spell
and
what
i
wanted
of
vivacity
and
confidence
was
more
than
made
up
by
the
tone
of
deep
sensibility
which
love
had
awakened
in
their
place
we
had
not
proceeded
far
before
the
glittering
of
lights
at
a
distance
and
the
shooting
up
of
fireworks
at
intervals
into
the
air
apprised
us
that
we
were
approaching
one
of
those
or
marts
which
it
is
the
custom
at
this
season
to
hold
upon
the
nile
to
me
the
scene
was
familiar
but
to
my
young
companion
it
was
evidently
a
new
world
and
the
mixture
of
alarm
and
delight
with
which
she
gazed
from
under
her
veil
upon
the
busy
scene
into
which
we
now
sailed
gave
an
air
of
innocence
to
her
beauty
which
still
more
heightened
its
every
charm
it
was
one
of
the
widest
parts
of
the
river
and
the
whole
surface
from
one
bank
to
the
other
was
covered
with
boats
along
the
banks
of
a
green
island
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
lay
anchored
the
galleys
of
the
principal
traders
floating
bazaars
bearing
each
the
name
of
its
owner
emblazoned
in
letters
of
flame
upon
the
stern
over
their
decks
were
spread
out
in
gay
confusion
the
products
of
the
loom
and
needle
of
egypt
carpets
of
memphis
and
those
variegated
veils
for
which
the
female
embroiderers
of
the
nile
are
so
celebrated
and
to
which
the
name
of
cleopatra
lends
a
traditional
value
in
each
of
the
other
galleys
was
exhibited
some
branch
of
egyptian
workmanship
of
the
fragrant
porcelain
of
on
of
that
frail
crystal
whose
hues
change
like
those
of
the
plumage
amulets
graven
with
the
head
of
anubis
and
necklaces
and
bracelets
of
the
black
beans
of
abyssinia
while
commerce
thus
displayed
her
luxuries
in
one
quarter
in
every
other
direction
pleasure
multiplied
into
her
thousand
shapes
swarmed
over
the
waters
nor
was
the
festivity
confined
to
the
river
only
all
along
the
banks
of
the
island
and
on
the
shores
lighted
up
mansions
were
seen
through
the
trees
from
which
sounds
of
music
and
merriment
came
in
some
of
the
boats
were
bands
of
minstrels
who
from
time
to
time
answered
each
other
like
echoes
across
the
wave
and
the
notes
of
the
lyre
the
flageolet
and
the
sweet
flute
were
heard
in
the
pauses
of
revelry
dying
along
the
waters
meanwhile
from
other
boats
stationed
in
the
least
lighted
places
the
workers
of
fire
sent
forth
their
wonders
into
the
air
bursting
out
from
time
to
time
as
if
in
the
very
exuberance
of
joy
these
sallies
of
flame
seemed
to
reach
the
sky
and
there
breaking
into
a
shower
of
sparkles
shed
such
a
splendour
round
as
brightened
even
the
white
arabian
hills
them
shine
like
the
brow
of
mount
atlas
at
night
when
the
fire
from
his
own
bosom
is
playing
around
its
snows
the
opportunity
which
this
luxurious
mart
afforded
us
of
providing
ourselves
with
other
and
less
remarkable
habiliments
than
those
in
which
we
had
escaped
from
that
nether
world
was
too
seasonable
not
to
be
gladly
taken
advantage
of
by
both
for
myself
the
strange
mystic
garb
that
i
wore
was
sufficiently
concealed
by
my
grecian
mantle
which
i
had
luckily
thrown
round
me
on
the
night
of
my
watch
but
the
thin
veil
of
my
companion
was
a
far
less
efficient
disguise
she
had
indeed
flung
away
the
golden
beetles
from
her
hair
but
the
sacred
robe
of
her
order
was
still
too
visible
and
the
stars
of
the
bandelet
shone
brightly
through
her
veil
most
gladly
therefore
did
she
avail
herself
of
this
opportunity
of
a
change
and
as
she
took
from
a
with
the
volume
i
had
seen
her
reading
appeared
to
be
her
only
small
jewel
to
exchange
for
the
simple
garments
she
had
chosen
there
fell
out
at
the
same
time
the
very
cross
of
silver
which
i
had
seen
her
kiss
as
may
be
remembered
in
the
monumental
chapel
and
which
was
afterwards
pressed
to
my
own
lips
this
link
for
such
it
appeared
to
my
imagination
between
us
now
revived
in
my
heart
all
the
burning
feelings
of
that
moment
had
i
not
abruptly
turned
away
my
agitation
would
but
too
plainly
have
betrayed
itself
the
object
for
which
we
had
delayed
in
this
gay
scene
being
accomplished
the
sail
was
again
spread
and
we
proceeded
on
our
course
up
the
river
the
sounds
and
the
lights
we
left
behind
died
gradually
away
and
we
now
floated
along
in
moonlight
and
silence
once
more
sweet
dews
worthy
of
being
called
tears
of
isis
fell
through
the
air
and
every
plant
and
flower
sent
its
fragrance
to
meet
them
the
wind
just
strong
enough
to
bear
us
smoothly
against
the
current
scarcely
stirred
the
shadow
of
the
tamarisks
on
the
water
as
the
inhabitants
from
all
quarters
were
collected
at
the
the
nile
was
more
than
usually
still
and
solitary
such
a
silence
indeed
prevailed
that
as
we
glided
near
the
shore
we
could
hear
the
rustling
of
the
acacias
as
the
chameleons
ran
up
their
stems
it
was
altogether
a
night
such
as
only
the
clime
of
egypt
can
boast
when
every
thing
lies
lulled
in
that
sort
of
bright
tranquillity
which
we
may
imagine
shines
over
the
sleep
of
those
happy
spirits
who
are
supposed
to
rest
in
the
valley
of
the
moon
on
their
way
to
heaven
by
such
a
light
and
at
such
an
hour
seated
side
by
side
on
the
deck
of
that
bark
did
we
pursue
our
course
up
the
lonely
a
mystery
to
the
thoughts
our
objects
our
very
names
a
secret
too
till
now
by
destinies
so
different
the
one
a
gay
voluptuary
of
the
garden
of
athens
the
other
a
secluded
priestess
of
the
temples
of
memphis
the
only
relation
yet
established
between
us
being
that
dangerous
one
of
love
passionate
love
on
one
side
and
the
most
feminine
and
confiding
dependence
on
the
other
the
passing
adventure
of
the
had
not
only
dispelled
still
more
our
mutual
reserve
but
had
supplied
us
with
a
subject
on
which
we
could
converse
without
embarrassment
from
this
topic
i
took
care
to
lead
on
without
interruption
to
others
lest
our
former
silence
should
return
and
the
music
of
her
voice
again
be
lost
to
me
it
was
indeed
only
by
thus
indirectly
unburdening
my
heart
that
i
was
enabled
to
refrain
from
the
full
utterance
of
all
i
thought
and
felt
and
the
restless
rapidity
with
which
i
flew
from
subject
to
subject
was
but
an
effort
to
escape
from
the
only
one
in
which
my
heart
was
interested
bright
and
happy
said
i
up
to
sothis
the
fair
star
of
the
waters
which
was
just
then
sparkling
brilliantly
over
our
heads
bright
and
happy
this
world
ought
to
be
your
egyptian
sages
pure
and
beautiful
luminary
was
its
then
still
leaning
back
and
letting
my
eyes
wander
over
the
firmament
as
if
seeking
to
disengage
them
from
the
fascination
which
they
the
study
i
said
for
ages
of
skies
like
this
may
the
pensive
and
mystic
character
of
your
nation
be
traced
that
mixture
of
pride
and
melancholy
which
naturally
arises
at
the
sight
of
those
eternal
lights
shining
out
of
darkness
sublime
but
saddened
anticipation
of
a
future
which
comes
over
the
soul
in
the
silence
of
such
an
hour
when
though
death
seems
to
reign
in
the
repose
of
earth
there
are
those
beacons
of
immortality
burning
in
the
pausing
as
i
uttered
the
word
with
a
sigh
to
think
how
little
my
heart
echoed
to
my
lips
i
looked
in
the
face
of
the
maiden
and
saw
that
it
had
lighted
up
as
i
spoke
into
a
glow
of
holy
animation
such
as
faith
alone
as
hope
herself
wears
when
she
is
dreaming
of
heaven
touched
by
the
contrast
and
gazing
upon
her
with
mournful
tenderness
i
found
my
arms
half
opened
to
clasp
her
to
my
heart
while
the
words
died
away
inaudibly
upon
my
lips
too
beautiful
maiden
must
thou
too
die
for
ever
my
i
felt
had
nearly
deserted
me
rising
abruptly
from
my
seat
i
walked
to
the
middle
of
the
deck
and
stood
for
some
moments
unconsciously
gazing
upon
one
of
those
fires
which
is
the
custom
of
all
who
travel
by
night
upon
the
nile
boatmen
had
just
kindled
to
scare
away
the
crocodiles
from
the
vessel
but
it
was
in
vain
that
i
endeavoured
to
compose
my
spirit
every
effort
i
made
but
more
deeply
convinced
me
that
till
the
mystery
which
hung
round
that
maiden
should
be
the
secret
with
which
my
own
bosom
laboured
should
be
was
fruitless
to
attempt
even
a
semblance
of
tranquillity
my
resolution
was
therefore
taken
lay
open
at
least
my
own
heart
as
far
as
such
a
revelation
might
be
risked
without
startling
the
timid
innocence
of
my
companion
thus
resolved
i
returned
with
more
composure
to
my
seat
by
her
side
and
taking
from
my
bosom
the
small
mirror
which
she
had
dropped
in
the
temple
and
which
i
had
ever
since
worn
suspended
round
my
neck
with
a
trembling
hand
presented
it
to
her
view
the
boatmen
had
just
kindled
one
of
their
near
us
and
its
light
as
she
leaned
forward
towards
the
mirror
fell
on
her
face
the
quick
blush
of
surprise
with
which
she
recognised
it
to
be
hers
and
her
look
of
bashful
yet
eager
inquiry
in
raising
her
eyes
to
mine
were
appeals
to
which
i
was
not
of
course
slow
in
answering
beginning
with
the
first
moment
when
i
saw
her
in
the
temple
and
passing
hastily
but
with
words
that
burned
as
they
went
over
the
impression
which
she
had
then
left
upon
my
heart
and
fancy
i
proceeded
to
describe
the
particulars
of
my
descent
into
the
surprise
and
adoration
at
the
door
of
the
encounter
with
the
trials
of
initiation
so
mysteriously
prepared
for
me
and
all
the
various
visionary
wonders
i
had
witnessed
in
that
region
till
the
moment
when
i
had
seen
her
stealing
from
under
the
veils
to
approach
me
though
in
detailing
these
events
i
had
said
but
little
of
the
feelings
they
had
awakened
in
me
my
lips
had
sent
back
many
a
sentence
unuttered
there
was
still
enough
that
could
neither
be
subdued
or
disguised
and
which
like
that
light
from
under
the
veils
of
her
own
isis
glowed
through
every
word
that
i
spoke
when
i
told
of
the
scene
in
the
chapel
the
silent
interview
which
i
had
witnessed
between
the
dead
and
the
living
maiden
leaned
down
her
head
and
wept
as
from
a
heart
full
of
tears
it
seemed
a
pleasure
to
her
however
to
listen
and
when
she
looked
at
me
again
there
was
an
earnest
and
affectionate
cordiality
in
her
eyes
as
if
the
knowledge
of
my
having
been
present
at
that
mournful
scene
had
opened
a
new
source
of
sympathy
and
intelligence
between
us
so
neighbouring
are
the
fountains
of
love
and
of
sorrow
and
so
imperceptibly
do
they
often
mingle
their
streams
little
indeed
as
i
was
guided
by
art
or
design
in
my
manner
and
conduct
to
this
innocent
girl
not
all
the
most
experienced
gallantry
of
the
garden
could
have
dictated
a
policy
half
so
seductive
as
that
which
my
new
master
love
now
taught
me
the
ardour
which
shown
at
once
and
without
reserve
might
have
startled
a
heart
so
little
prepared
for
it
thus
checked
and
softened
by
the
timidity
of
real
love
won
its
way
without
alarm
and
when
most
diffident
of
success
most
triumphed
like
one
whose
sleep
is
gradually
broken
by
music
the
heart
was
awakened
without
being
disturbed
she
followed
the
charm
unconscious
whither
it
led
nor
was
aware
of
the
flame
she
had
lighted
in
bosom
till
she
perceived
the
reflection
of
it
glimmering
in
her
own
impatient
as
i
was
to
appeal
to
her
generosity
and
sympathy
for
a
similar
proof
of
confidence
to
that
which
i
had
just
given
the
night
was
now
too
far
advanced
for
me
to
impose
such
a
task
upon
her
after
exchanging
a
few
words
in
which
though
little
was
said
there
was
a
tone
and
manner
that
spoke
far
more
than
language
we
took
a
lingering
leave
of
each
other
for
the
night
with
every
prospect
of
still
being
together
in
our
dreams
chap
xiii
it
was
so
near
the
dawn
of
day
when
we
parted
that
we
again
found
the
sun
sinking
westward
when
we
rejoined
each
other
the
smile
with
which
she
met
me
frankly
cordial
have
been
taken
for
the
greeting
of
a
long
mellowed
friendship
did
not
the
blush
and
the
castdown
eyelid
that
followed
give
symptoms
of
a
feeling
newer
and
less
calm
for
myself
lightened
as
i
was
in
some
degree
by
the
confession
which
i
had
made
i
was
yet
too
conscious
of
the
new
aspect
thus
given
to
our
intercourse
to
feel
altogether
unembarrassed
at
the
prospect
of
returning
to
the
theme
it
was
therefore
willingly
we
both
suffered
our
attention
to
be
diverted
by
the
variety
of
objects
that
presented
themselves
on
the
way
from
a
subject
that
both
equally
trembled
to
approach
the
river
was
now
full
of
life
and
motion
every
moment
we
met
with
boats
descending
the
current
so
independent
of
aid
from
sail
or
oar
that
the
sailors
sat
idly
upon
the
deck
as
they
shot
along
singing
or
playing
upon
their
pipes
of
these
boats
the
greater
number
came
loaded
with
merchandise
from
coptos
with
those
large
emeralds
from
the
mine
in
the
desert
whose
colours
it
is
said
are
brightest
at
the
full
of
the
moon
and
some
laden
with
frankincense
from
the
near
the
red
sea
on
the
decks
of
others
that
had
been
to
the
golden
mountains
beyond
syene
were
heaped
blocks
and
fragments
of
that
wood
which
the
green
nile
of
nubia
washes
down
in
the
season
of
the
floods
our
companions
up
the
stream
were
far
less
numerous
occasionally
a
boat
returning
lightened
from
the
fair
of
last
night
with
those
high
sails
that
catch
every
breeze
from
over
the
hills
shot
past
us
now
and
then
we
overtook
one
of
those
barges
full
of
bees
that
at
this
season
of
the
year
are
sent
to
colonise
the
gardens
of
the
south
and
take
advantage
of
the
first
flowers
after
the
inundation
has
passed
away
by
these
various
objects
we
were
for
a
short
time
enabled
to
divert
the
conversation
from
lighting
and
settling
upon
the
one
subject
round
which
it
continually
hovered
but
the
effort
as
might
be
expected
was
not
long
successful
as
evening
advanced
the
whole
scene
became
more
solitary
we
less
frequently
ventured
to
look
upon
each
other
and
our
intervals
of
silence
grew
more
long
it
was
near
sunset
when
in
passing
a
small
temple
on
the
shore
whose
porticoes
were
now
full
of
the
evening
light
we
saw
issuing
from
a
thicket
of
acanthus
near
it
a
train
of
young
maids
linked
together
in
the
dance
by
held
at
length
between
them
their
tresses
were
also
wreathed
with
this
emblem
of
the
season
and
such
a
profusion
of
the
white
flowers
were
twisted
round
their
waists
and
arms
that
they
might
have
been
taken
as
they
gracefully
bounded
along
the
bank
for
nymphs
of
the
nile
risen
freshly
from
their
gardens
under
the
wave
after
looking
for
a
few
moments
at
this
sacred
dance
the
maid
turned
away
her
eyes
with
a
look
of
pain
as
if
the
remembrances
it
recalled
were
of
no
welcome
nature
this
momentary
retrospect
this
glimpse
into
the
past
seemed
to
offer
a
sort
of
clue
to
the
secret
for
which
i
panted
gradually
and
delicately
as
my
impatience
would
allow
i
availed
myself
of
it
her
frankness
however
saved
me
the
embarrassment
of
much
questioning
she
even
seemed
to
feel
that
the
confidence
i
sought
was
due
to
me
and
beyond
the
natural
hesitation
of
maidenly
modesty
not
a
shade
of
reserve
or
evasion
appeared
to
attempt
to
repeat
in
her
own
touching
words
the
simple
story
which
she
now
related
to
me
would
be
like
endeavouring
to
note
down
some
strain
of
unpremeditated
music
with
those
fugitive
graces
those
felicities
of
the
moment
which
no
art
can
restore
as
they
first
met
the
ear
from
a
feeling
too
of
humility
she
had
omitted
in
her
narrative
some
particulars
relating
to
herself
which
i
afterwards
learned
others
not
less
important
she
but
slightly
passed
over
from
a
fear
of
wounding
the
prejudices
of
her
heathen
hearer
i
shall
therefore
give
her
story
as
the
outline
which
she
herself
sketched
was
afterwards
filled
up
by
a
pious
and
venerable
hand
far
more
worthy
than
mine
of
being
associated
with
the
memory
of
such
purity
story
of
alēthe
mother
of
this
maiden
was
the
beautiful
theora
of
alexandria
who
though
a
native
of
that
city
was
descended
from
grecian
parents
when
very
young
theora
was
one
of
the
seven
maidens
selected
to
note
down
the
discourses
of
the
eloquent
origen
who
at
that
period
presided
over
the
school
of
alexandria
and
was
in
all
the
fulness
of
his
fame
both
among
pagans
and
christians
endowed
richly
with
the
learning
of
both
creeds
he
brought
the
natural
light
of
philosophy
to
elucidate
the
mysteries
of
faith
and
was
only
proud
of
his
knowledge
of
the
wisdom
of
this
world
inasmuch
as
it
ministered
to
the
triumph
of
divine
truth
he
had
courted
in
vain
the
crown
of
martyrdom
it
was
held
throughout
his
life
suspended
over
his
head
and
in
more
than
one
persecution
he
had
evinced
his
readiness
to
die
for
that
faith
which
he
lived
but
to
testify
and
adorn
on
one
of
these
occasions
his
tormentors
having
habited
him
like
an
egyptian
priest
placed
him
upon
the
steps
of
the
temple
of
serapis
and
commanded
that
he
should
in
the
manner
of
the
pagan
ministers
present
to
the
multitude
who
went
up
to
the
shrine
but
the
courageous
christian
disappointed
their
views
holding
forth
the
branches
with
an
unshrinking
hand
he
cried
aloud
hither
and
take
the
branch
not
of
an
idol
temple
but
of
indefatigable
was
this
learned
father
in
his
studies
that
while
composing
his
commentary
on
the
scriptures
he
was
attended
by
seven
scribes
or
notaries
who
relieved
each
other
in
taking
down
the
dictates
of
his
eloquent
tongue
while
the
same
number
of
young
females
selected
for
the
beauty
of
their
penmanship
were
employed
in
arranging
and
transcribing
the
precious
leaves
the
scribes
so
selected
was
the
fair
young
theora
whose
parents
though
attached
to
the
pagan
worship
were
not
unwilling
to
profit
by
the
accomplishments
of
their
daughter
thus
devoted
to
a
task
which
they
considered
purely
mechanical
to
the
maid
herself
however
her
task
brought
far
other
feelings
and
consequences
she
read
anxiously
as
she
wrote
and
the
divine
truths
so
eloquently
illustrated
found
their
way
by
degrees
from
the
page
to
her
heart
deeply
too
as
the
written
words
affected
her
the
discourses
from
the
lips
of
the
great
teacher
himself
which
she
had
frequent
opportunities
of
hearing
sunk
still
more
deeply
into
her
mind
there
was
at
once
a
sublimity
and
gentleness
in
his
views
of
religion
which
to
the
tender
hearts
and
lively
imaginations
of
women
never
failed
to
appeal
with
convincing
power
accordingly
the
list
of
his
female
pupils
was
numerous
and
the
names
of
barbara
juliana
heraïs
and
others
bear
honourable
testimony
to
his
influence
over
that
sex
theora
the
feeling
with
which
his
discourses
inspired
her
was
like
a
new
soul
consciousness
of
spiritual
existence
unfelt
before
by
the
eloquence
of
the
comment
she
was
awakened
into
admiration
of
the
text
and
when
by
the
kindness
of
a
catechumen
of
the
school
who
had
been
struck
by
her
innocent
zeal
she
for
the
first
time
became
possessor
of
a
copy
of
the
scriptures
she
could
not
sleep
for
thinking
of
her
sacred
treasure
with
a
mixture
of
pleasure
and
fear
she
hid
it
from
all
eyes
and
was
like
one
who
had
received
a
divine
guest
under
her
roof
and
felt
fearful
of
betraying
its
divinity
to
the
world
heart
so
awake
would
have
been
easily
secured
to
the
faith
had
her
opportunities
of
hearing
the
sacred
word
continued
but
circumstances
arose
to
deprive
her
of
this
advantage
the
mild
origen
long
harassed
and
thwarted
in
his
labours
by
the
tyranny
of
the
bishop
of
alexandria
demetrius
was
obliged
to
relinquish
his
school
and
fly
from
egypt
the
occupation
of
the
fair
scribe
was
therefore
at
an
end
her
intercourse
with
the
followers
of
the
new
faith
ceased
and
the
growing
enthusiasm
of
her
heart
gave
way
to
more
worldly
impressions
among
the
rest
had
its
share
in
alienating
her
thoughts
from
religion
while
still
very
young
she
became
the
wife
of
a
greek
adventurer
who
had
come
to
egypt
as
a
purchaser
of
that
rich
tapestry
in
which
the
needles
of
persia
are
rivalled
by
the
looms
of
the
nile
having
taken
his
young
bride
to
memphis
which
was
still
the
great
mart
of
this
merchandise
he
there
in
the
midst
of
his
speculations
died
his
widow
on
the
point
of
becoming
a
mother
while
as
yet
but
in
her
nineteenth
year
single
and
unprotected
females
it
has
been
at
all
times
a
favourite
resource
to
seek
admission
into
the
service
of
some
of
those
great
temples
which
absorb
so
much
of
the
wealth
and
power
of
egypt
in
most
of
these
institutions
there
exists
an
order
of
priestesses
which
though
not
hereditary
like
that
of
the
priests
is
provided
for
by
ample
endowments
and
confers
that
rank
and
station
with
which
in
a
government
so
theocratic
religion
is
sure
to
invest
even
her
humblest
handmaids
from
the
general
policy
of
the
sacred
college
of
memphis
it
may
be
concluded
that
an
accomplished
female
like
theora
found
but
little
difficulty
in
being
chosen
one
of
the
priestesses
of
isis
and
it
was
in
the
service
of
the
subterranean
shrines
that
her
ministry
chiefly
lay
a
month
or
two
after
her
admission
she
gave
birth
to
alethe
who
first
opened
her
eyes
among
the
unholy
pomps
and
specious
miracles
of
this
mysterious
region
though
theora
as
we
have
seen
had
been
diverted
by
other
feelings
from
her
first
enthusiasm
for
the
christian
faith
she
had
never
wholly
forgot
the
impression
then
made
upon
her
the
sacred
volume
which
the
pious
catechumen
had
given
her
was
still
treasured
with
care
and
though
she
seldom
opened
its
pages
there
was
an
idea
of
sanctity
associated
with
it
in
her
memory
and
often
would
she
sit
to
look
upon
it
with
reverential
pleasure
recalling
the
happiness
she
felt
when
it
was
first
made
her
own
leisure
of
her
new
retreat
and
the
lone
melancholy
of
widowhood
led
her
still
more
frequently
to
indulge
in
such
thoughts
and
to
recur
to
those
consoling
truths
which
she
had
heard
in
the
school
of
alexandria
she
now
began
to
peruse
eagerly
the
sacred
book
drinking
deep
of
the
fountain
of
which
she
before
but
tasted
and
thousands
of
mourners
since
her
have
christianity
is
the
true
religion
of
the
sorrowful
study
of
her
secret
hours
became
still
more
dear
to
her
from
the
peril
with
which
at
that
period
it
was
attended
and
the
necessity
she
was
under
of
concealing
from
those
around
her
the
precious
light
that
had
been
kindled
in
her
heart
too
timid
to
encounter
the
fierce
persecution
which
awaited
all
who
were
suspected
of
a
leaning
to
christianity
she
continued
to
officiate
in
the
pomps
and
ceremonies
of
the
temple
often
with
such
remorse
of
soul
that
she
would
pause
in
the
midst
of
the
rites
and
pray
inwardly
to
god
that
he
would
forgive
this
profanation
of
his
spirit
the
mean
time
her
daughter
the
young
alethe
grew
up
still
lovelier
than
herself
and
added
every
hour
to
her
happiness
and
her
fears
when
arrived
at
a
sufficient
age
she
was
taught
like
the
other
children
of
the
priestesses
to
take
a
share
in
the
service
and
ceremonies
of
the
shrines
the
duty
of
some
of
these
young
servitors
was
to
look
after
the
flowers
for
the
altar
others
to
take
care
that
the
sacred
vases
were
filled
every
day
with
fresh
water
from
the
nile
the
task
of
some
was
to
preserve
in
perfect
polish
those
silver
images
of
the
moon
which
the
priests
carried
in
processions
while
others
were
as
we
have
seen
employed
in
feeding
the
consecrated
animals
and
in
keeping
their
plumes
and
scales
bright
for
the
admiring
eyes
of
their
worshippers
office
allotted
to
most
honourable
of
these
minor
to
wait
upon
the
sacred
birds
of
the
moon
to
feed
them
with
those
eggs
from
the
nile
which
they
loved
and
provide
for
their
use
that
purest
water
which
alone
these
delicate
birds
will
touch
this
employment
was
the
delight
of
her
childish
hours
and
that
ibis
which
alciphron
the
epicurean
saw
her
dance
round
in
the
temple
was
her
favourite
of
all
the
sacred
flock
and
had
been
daily
fondled
and
fed
by
her
from
infancy
as
being
one
of
the
chief
spells
of
this
enchanted
region
was
an
accomplishment
required
of
all
its
ministrants
and
the
harp
the
lyre
and
the
sacred
flute
sounded
nowhere
so
sweetly
as
that
through
these
subterranean
gardens
the
chief
object
indeed
in
the
education
of
the
youth
of
the
temple
was
to
fit
them
by
every
grace
of
art
and
nature
to
give
effect
to
the
illusion
of
those
shows
and
phantasms
in
which
the
whole
charm
and
secret
of
initiation
lay
the
means
employed
to
support
the
old
system
of
superstition
against
the
infidelity
and
still
more
the
new
faith
that
menaced
it
was
an
increased
display
of
splendour
and
marvels
in
those
mysteries
for
which
egypt
has
so
long
been
celebrated
of
these
ceremonies
so
many
imitations
had
under
various
names
been
multiplied
through
europe
that
the
parent
superstition
ran
a
risk
of
being
eclipsed
by
its
progeny
and
in
order
still
to
retain
their
rank
of
the
first
priesthood
in
the
world
those
of
egypt
found
it
necessary
to
continue
still
the
best
impostors
every
contrivance
that
art
could
devise
or
labour
resource
that
the
wonderful
knowledge
of
the
priests
in
pyrotechny
mechanics
and
dioptrics
could
command
was
brought
into
action
to
heighten
the
effect
of
their
mysteries
and
give
an
air
of
enchantment
to
every
thing
connected
with
them
final
scene
of
elysium
into
which
the
initiate
was
received
of
course
the
leading
attraction
of
these
ceremonies
and
to
render
it
captivating
alike
to
the
senses
of
the
man
of
pleasure
and
the
imagination
of
the
spiritualist
was
the
object
to
which
the
whole
skill
and
attention
of
the
sacred
college
were
devoted
by
the
influence
of
the
priests
of
memphis
over
those
of
the
other
temples
they
had
succeeded
in
extending
their
subterranean
frontier
both
to
the
north
and
south
so
as
to
include
within
their
paradise
some
of
the
gardens
excavated
for
the
use
of
the
other
twelve
shrines
beauty
of
the
young
alethe
the
touching
sweetness
of
her
voice
and
the
sensibility
that
breathed
throughout
her
every
look
and
movement
rendered
her
a
powerful
auxiliary
in
such
appeals
to
the
imagination
she
was
accordingly
from
her
childhood
selected
from
among
her
fair
companions
as
the
most
worthy
representative
of
spiritual
loveliness
in
those
pictures
of
scenes
of
another
which
not
only
the
fancy
but
the
reason
of
the
excited
aspirants
was
dazzled
the
innocent
child
herself
these
shows
were
pastime
but
to
theora
who
knew
too
well
the
imposition
to
which
they
were
subservient
this
profanation
of
all
that
she
loved
was
a
perpetual
source
of
horror
and
remorse
often
would
alethe
stood
smiling
before
her
arrayed
perhaps
as
a
spirit
of
the
elysian
world
away
with
a
shudder
from
the
happy
child
almost
fancying
that
she
already
saw
the
shadows
of
sin
descending
over
that
innocent
brow
as
she
gazed
on
it
the
intellect
of
the
young
maid
became
more
active
and
inquiring
the
apprehensions
and
difficulties
of
the
mother
increased
afraid
to
communicate
her
own
precious
secret
lest
she
should
involve
her
child
in
the
dangers
that
encompassed
it
she
yet
felt
it
to
be
no
less
a
cruelty
than
a
crime
to
leave
her
wholly
immersed
in
the
darkness
of
paganism
in
this
dilemma
the
only
resource
that
remained
to
her
was
to
select
and
disengage
from
the
dross
that
surrounded
them
those
pure
particles
of
truth
which
lie
at
the
bottom
of
all
religions
feelings
rather
than
doctrines
which
god
has
never
left
his
creatures
without
and
which
in
all
ages
have
furnished
to
those
who
sought
it
some
clue
to
his
glory
unity
and
perfect
goodness
of
the
creator
the
fall
of
the
human
soul
into
corruption
its
struggles
with
the
darkness
of
this
world
and
its
final
redemption
and
to
the
source
of
all
spirit
natural
solutions
of
the
problem
of
our
existence
these
elementary
grounds
of
all
religion
and
virtue
which
theora
had
heard
illustrated
by
her
christian
teacher
lay
also
she
knew
veiled
under
the
theology
of
egypt
and
to
impress
them
in
all
their
abstract
purity
upon
the
mind
of
her
susceptible
pupil
was
in
default
of
more
heavenly
lights
her
sole
ambition
and
care
was
their
habit
after
devoting
their
mornings
to
the
service
of
the
temple
to
pass
their
evenings
and
nights
in
one
of
those
small
mansions
above
ground
allotted
to
some
of
the
most
favoured
priestesses
in
the
precincts
of
the
sacred
college
here
out
of
the
reach
of
those
gross
superstitions
which
pursued
them
at
every
step
below
she
endeavoured
to
inform
as
far
as
she
might
the
mind
of
her
beloved
girl
and
found
it
lean
as
naturally
and
instinctively
to
truth
as
plants
that
have
been
long
shut
up
in
darkness
will
when
light
is
let
in
incline
themselves
to
its
ray
as
they
sat
together
on
the
terrace
at
night
contemplating
that
assembly
of
glorious
stars
whose
beauty
first
misled
mankind
into
idolatry
she
would
explain
to
the
young
listener
by
what
gradations
it
was
that
the
worship
thus
transferred
from
the
creator
to
the
creature
sunk
lower
and
lower
in
the
scale
of
being
till
man
at
length
presumed
to
deify
man
and
by
the
most
monstrous
of
inversions
heaven
was
made
the
mirror
of
earth
reflecting
all
its
most
earthly
features
in
the
temple
itself
the
anxious
mother
would
endeavour
to
interpose
her
purer
lessons
among
the
idolatrous
ceremonies
in
which
they
were
engaged
when
the
favourite
ibis
of
alethe
took
its
station
on
the
shrine
and
the
young
maiden
was
seen
approaching
with
all
the
gravity
of
worship
the
very
bird
which
she
had
played
with
but
an
hour
before
the
which
she
herself
had
plucked
seemed
to
acquire
a
sudden
sacredness
in
her
eyes
as
soon
as
the
priest
had
breathed
on
it
all
such
occasions
theora
though
with
fear
and
trembling
would
venture
to
suggest
to
the
youthful
worshipper
the
distinction
that
should
be
drawn
between
the
sensible
object
of
adoration
and
that
spiritual
unseen
deity
of
which
it
was
but
the
remembrancer
or
type
sorrow
however
she
soon
discovered
that
in
thus
but
partially
enlightening
a
mind
too
ardent
to
be
satisfied
with
such
glimmerings
she
only
bewildered
the
heart
that
she
meant
to
guide
and
cut
down
the
hope
round
which
its
faith
twined
without
substituting
any
other
support
in
its
place
as
the
beauty
too
of
alethe
began
to
attract
all
eyes
new
fears
crowded
upon
the
heart
in
which
she
was
but
too
much
justified
by
the
characters
of
some
of
those
around
her
this
sacred
abode
as
may
easily
be
conceived
morality
did
not
always
go
hand
in
hand
with
religion
the
hypocritical
and
ambitious
orcus
who
was
at
this
period
high
priest
of
memphis
was
a
man
in
every
respect
qualified
to
preside
over
a
system
of
such
splendid
fraud
he
had
reached
that
effective
time
of
life
when
enough
of
the
warmth
of
youth
remains
to
give
animation
to
the
counsels
of
age
but
in
his
instance
youth
had
only
the
baser
passions
to
bequeath
while
age
but
contributed
a
more
refined
maturity
of
mischief
the
advantages
of
a
faith
appealing
so
wholly
to
the
senses
were
well
understood
by
him
nor
was
he
ignorant
that
the
only
way
of
making
religion
subservient
to
his
own
interests
was
by
shaping
it
adroitly
to
the
passions
of
others
state
of
misery
and
remorse
in
which
the
mind
of
theora
was
kept
by
the
scenes
however
veiled
by
hypocrisy
which
she
witnessed
around
her
became
at
length
intolerable
no
perils
that
the
cause
of
truth
could
bring
with
it
would
be
half
so
dreadful
as
this
endurance
of
sinfulness
and
deceit
her
child
was
as
yet
pure
and
innocent
without
that
sentinel
of
the
soul
religion
how
long
might
she
continue
so
thought
at
once
decided
her
other
fears
vanished
before
it
she
resolved
instantly
to
lay
open
to
alethe
the
whole
secret
of
her
soul
to
make
her
who
was
her
only
hope
on
earth
the
sharer
of
all
her
hopes
in
heaven
and
then
fly
with
her
as
soon
as
possible
from
this
unhallowed
place
to
the
the
any
place
however
desolate
where
god
and
the
consciousness
of
innocence
might
be
with
them
promptitude
with
which
her
young
pupil
caught
from
her
the
divine
truths
was
even
beyond
what
she
expected
it
was
like
the
lighting
of
one
torch
at
another
prepared
was
mind
for
the
illumination
amply
was
the
mother
now
repaid
for
all
her
misery
by
this
perfect
communion
of
love
and
faith
and
by
the
delight
with
which
she
saw
her
beloved
the
young
antelope
when
first
led
by
her
dam
to
the
well
thirstily
by
her
side
at
the
source
of
all
life
and
truth
such
happiness
was
not
long
to
last
the
anxieties
that
theora
had
suffered
preyed
upon
her
health
she
felt
her
strength
daily
decline
and
the
thoughts
of
leaving
alone
and
unguarded
in
the
world
that
treasure
which
she
had
just
devoted
to
heaven
gave
her
a
feeling
of
despair
which
but
hastened
the
ebb
of
life
had
she
put
in
practice
her
resolution
of
flying
from
this
place
her
child
might
have
been
now
beyond
the
reach
of
all
she
dreaded
and
in
the
solitude
of
the
wilderness
would
have
found
at
least
safety
from
wrong
but
the
very
happiness
she
had
felt
in
her
new
task
diverted
her
from
this
project
it
was
now
too
late
for
she
was
already
dying
concealed
however
her
state
from
the
tender
and
sanguine
girl
who
though
she
saw
the
traces
of
disease
on
her
cheek
little
knew
that
they
were
the
hastening
footsteps
of
death
nor
thought
even
of
the
possibility
of
losing
what
was
so
dear
to
her
too
soon
however
the
moment
of
separation
arrived
and
while
the
anguish
and
dismay
of
alethe
were
in
proportion
to
the
security
in
which
she
had
indulged
theora
too
felt
with
bitter
regret
that
she
had
sacrificed
to
her
fond
consideration
much
precious
time
and
that
there
now
remained
but
a
few
brief
and
painful
moments
for
the
communication
of
all
those
wishes
and
instructions
on
which
the
future
destiny
of
the
young
orphan
depended
had
indeed
time
for
little
more
than
to
place
the
sacred
volume
solemnly
in
her
hands
to
implore
that
she
would
at
all
risks
fly
from
this
unholy
place
and
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
mountains
of
the
saïd
to
name
with
her
last
breath
the
holy
man
to
whom
under
heaven
she
trusted
for
the
protection
and
salvation
of
her
child
first
violence
of
feeling
to
which
alethe
gave
way
was
succeeded
by
a
fixed
and
tearless
grief
which
rendered
her
insensible
for
some
time
to
the
dangers
of
her
situation
her
only
comfort
was
in
visiting
that
monumental
chapel
where
the
beautiful
remains
of
theora
lay
there
night
after
night
in
contemplation
of
those
placid
features
and
in
prayers
for
the
peace
of
the
departed
spirit
did
she
pass
her
lonely
as
they
hours
though
the
mystic
emblems
that
decorated
that
chapel
were
but
ill
suited
to
the
slumber
of
a
christian
saint
there
was
one
among
them
the
cross
which
by
a
remarkable
coincidence
is
an
emblem
common
alike
to
the
gentile
and
the
christian
to
the
former
a
shadowy
type
of
that
immortality
of
which
to
the
latter
it
is
a
substantial
and
assuring
pledge
upon
this
cross
which
she
had
often
seen
her
lost
mother
kiss
did
she
breathe
forth
a
solemn
and
heartfelt
vow
never
to
abandon
the
faith
which
that
departed
spirit
had
bequeathed
to
her
to
such
enthusiasm
indeed
did
her
heart
at
such
moments
rise
that
but
for
the
last
injunctions
from
those
pallid
lips
she
would
at
once
have
avowed
her
perilous
secret
and
spoken
out
the
words
am
a
christian
among
those
benighted
shrines
the
will
of
her
to
whom
she
owed
more
than
life
was
to
be
obeyed
to
escape
from
this
haunt
of
superstition
must
now
she
felt
be
her
first
object
and
in
devising
the
means
of
effecting
it
her
mind
day
and
night
was
employed
it
was
with
a
loathing
not
to
be
concealed
she
now
found
herself
compelled
to
resume
her
idolatrous
services
at
the
shrine
to
some
of
the
offices
of
theora
she
succeeded
as
is
the
custom
by
inheritance
and
in
the
performance
of
as
they
were
in
her
eyes
by
the
pure
spirit
she
had
seen
engaged
in
was
a
sort
of
melancholy
pleasure
in
which
her
sorrow
found
relief
but
the
part
she
was
again
forced
to
take
in
the
scenic
shows
of
the
mysteries
brought
with
it
a
sense
of
wrong
and
degradation
which
she
could
no
longer
bear
had
already
formed
in
her
own
mind
a
plan
of
escape
in
which
her
knowledge
of
all
the
windings
of
this
subterranean
realm
gave
her
confidence
when
the
reception
of
alciphron
as
an
initiate
took
place
the
first
moment
of
the
landing
of
that
philosopher
at
alexandria
he
had
become
an
object
of
suspicion
and
watchfulness
to
the
inquisitorial
orcus
whom
philosophy
in
any
shape
naturally
alarmed
but
to
whom
the
sect
over
which
the
young
athenian
presided
was
particularly
obnoxious
the
accomplishments
of
alciphron
his
popularity
wherever
he
went
and
the
freedom
with
which
he
indulged
his
wit
at
the
expense
of
religion
was
all
faithfully
reported
to
the
high
priest
by
his
spies
and
stirred
up
within
him
no
kindly
feelings
towards
the
stranger
in
dealing
with
an
infidel
such
a
personage
as
orcus
could
know
no
alternative
but
that
of
either
converting
or
destroying
him
and
though
his
spite
as
a
man
would
have
been
more
gratified
by
the
latter
proceeding
his
pride
as
a
priest
led
him
to
prefer
the
triumph
of
the
former
first
descent
of
the
epicurean
into
the
pyramid
was
speedily
known
and
the
alarm
immediately
given
to
the
priests
below
as
soon
as
it
was
discovered
that
the
young
philosopher
of
athens
was
the
intruder
and
that
he
still
continued
to
linger
round
the
pyramid
looking
often
and
wistfully
towards
the
portal
it
was
concluded
that
his
curiosity
would
impel
him
to
try
a
second
descent
and
orcus
blessing
the
good
chance
which
had
thus
brought
the
wild
bird
to
his
net
determined
not
to
allow
an
opportunity
so
precious
to
be
wasted
the
whole
of
that
wonderful
machinery
by
which
the
phantasms
and
illusions
of
initiation
are
produced
were
put
in
active
preparation
throughout
that
subterranean
realm
and
the
increased
stir
and
watchfulness
excited
among
its
inmates
by
this
more
than
ordinary
display
of
all
the
resources
of
priestcraft
rendered
the
accomplishment
of
design
at
such
a
moment
peculiarly
difficult
wholly
ignorant
of
the
share
which
had
fallen
to
herself
in
attracting
the
young
philosopher
down
to
this
region
she
but
heard
of
him
vaguely
as
the
chief
of
a
great
grecian
sect
who
had
been
led
by
either
curiosity
or
accident
to
expose
himself
to
the
first
trials
of
initiation
and
whom
the
priests
she
saw
were
endeavouring
to
ensnare
in
their
toils
by
every
art
and
skill
with
which
their
science
of
darkness
had
gifted
them
her
mind
the
image
of
a
philosopher
such
as
alciphron
had
been
represented
to
her
came
associated
with
ideas
of
age
and
reverence
and
more
than
once
the
possibility
of
his
being
made
instrumental
to
her
deliverance
flashed
a
hope
across
her
heart
in
which
she
could
not
help
indulging
often
had
she
been
told
by
theora
of
the
many
gentile
sages
who
had
laid
their
wisdom
down
humbly
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
and
though
this
initiate
she
feared
could
hardly
be
among
the
number
yet
the
rumours
which
she
had
gathered
from
the
servants
of
the
temple
of
his
undisguised
contempt
for
the
errors
of
heathenism
led
her
to
hope
she
might
find
tolerance
if
not
sympathy
in
her
appeal
to
him
was
it
solely
with
a
view
to
her
own
chance
of
deliverance
that
she
thus
connected
him
in
her
thoughts
with
the
plan
which
she
meditated
the
look
of
proud
and
malice
with
which
the
high
priest
had
mentioned
this
as
he
styled
him
when
instructing
her
in
the
scene
she
was
to
enact
before
the
philosopher
in
the
valley
but
too
plainly
informed
her
of
the
destiny
that
hung
over
him
she
knew
how
many
were
the
hapless
candidates
for
initiation
who
had
been
doomed
to
a
durance
worse
than
that
of
the
grave
for
but
a
word
a
whisper
breathed
against
the
sacred
absurdities
which
they
witnessed
and
it
was
evident
to
her
that
the
venerable
greek
for
such
her
fancy
represented
alciphron
was
no
less
interested
in
escaping
from
this
region
than
herself
own
resolution
was
at
all
events
fixed
that
visionary
scene
in
which
she
had
appeared
before
alciphron
knowing
how
ardent
were
the
heart
and
imagination
over
which
her
beauty
at
that
moment
shed
its
whole
influence
she
solemnly
resolved
the
very
last
unholy
service
that
superstition
or
imposture
should
ever
command
of
her
the
following
night
the
aspirant
was
to
watch
in
the
great
temple
of
isis
such
an
opportunity
of
approaching
and
addressing
him
might
never
come
again
should
he
from
compassion
for
her
situation
or
a
sense
of
the
danger
of
his
own
consent
to
lend
his
aid
to
her
flight
most
gladly
would
she
accept
it
that
no
danger
or
treachery
she
might
risk
could
be
half
so
dreadful
as
those
she
left
behind
should
he
on
the
contrary
refuse
her
determination
was
equally
trust
to
that
god
who
watches
over
the
innocent
and
go
forth
alone
reach
the
island
in
lake
mœris
was
her
first
object
and
there
occurred
luckily
at
this
time
a
mode
of
accomplishing
it
by
which
the
difficulty
and
dangers
of
the
attempt
would
be
in
a
great
degree
diminished
the
day
of
the
annual
visitation
of
the
high
priest
to
the
place
of
that
island
in
the
centre
of
the
lake
is
now
fast
approaching
and
alethe
well
knew
that
the
car
by
which
the
high
priest
and
one
of
the
hierophants
are
conveyed
to
the
chambers
under
the
lake
stood
waiting
in
readiness
by
availing
herself
of
this
expedient
she
would
gain
the
double
advantage
both
of
facilitating
her
own
flight
and
retarding
the
speed
of
her
pursuers
paid
a
last
visit
to
the
tomb
of
her
beloved
mother
and
wept
there
long
and
passionately
till
her
heart
almost
failed
in
the
struggle
paused
too
to
give
a
kiss
to
her
favourite
ibis
which
though
too
much
a
christian
to
worship
she
was
still
child
enough
to
love
a
trembling
step
she
went
early
to
the
sanctuary
and
hid
herself
in
one
of
the
recesses
of
the
shrine
her
intention
was
to
steal
out
from
thence
to
alciphron
while
it
was
yet
dark
and
before
the
illumination
of
the
great
statue
behind
the
veils
had
begun
but
her
fears
delayed
her
till
it
was
almost
too
late
was
the
image
lighted
up
and
still
she
remained
trembling
in
her
hiding
place
a
few
minutes
more
the
mighty
veils
would
have
been
withdrawn
and
the
glories
of
that
scene
of
enchantment
laid
open
at
length
summoning
up
courage
and
taking
advantage
of
a
momentary
absence
of
those
employed
in
the
preparations
of
this
splendid
mockery
she
stole
from
under
the
veil
and
found
her
way
through
the
gloom
to
the
epicurean
there
was
then
no
time
for
explanation
had
but
to
trust
to
the
simple
words
and
be
silent
and
the
implicit
readiness
with
which
she
found
them
obeyed
filled
her
with
no
less
surprise
than
the
philosopher
himself
felt
in
hearing
them
a
second
or
two
they
were
on
their
way
through
the
subterranean
windings
leaving
the
ministers
of
isis
to
waste
their
splendours
on
vacancy
through
a
long
series
of
miracles
and
visions
which
they
now
exhibited
that
he
whom
they
took
such
pains
to
dazzle
was
already
under
the
guidance
of
the
young
christian
removed
beyond
the
reach
of
their
chap
xiv
such
was
the
story
of
which
this
innocent
girl
gave
me
in
her
own
touching
language
the
outline
the
sun
was
just
rising
as
she
finished
her
narrative
fearful
of
encountering
the
expression
of
those
feelings
with
which
she
could
not
but
observe
i
was
affected
by
her
recital
scarcely
had
she
concluded
the
last
sentence
when
rising
abruptly
from
her
seat
she
hurried
into
the
pavilion
leaving
me
with
the
words
already
crowding
for
utterance
to
my
lips
oppressed
by
the
various
emotions
thus
sent
back
upon
my
heart
i
lay
down
on
the
deck
in
a
state
of
agitation
that
defied
even
the
most
distant
approaches
of
sleep
while
every
word
she
had
uttered
every
feeling
she
expressed
but
ministered
new
fuel
to
that
flame
within
me
to
describe
which
passion
is
too
weak
a
word
there
was
also
much
of
her
recital
that
disheartened
that
alarmed
me
to
find
a
christian
thus
under
the
garb
of
a
memphian
priestess
was
a
discovery
that
had
my
heart
been
less
deeply
interested
would
but
have
more
powerfully
stimulated
my
imagination
and
pride
but
when
i
recollected
the
austerity
of
the
faith
she
had
embraced
tender
and
sacred
tie
associated
with
it
in
her
memory
and
the
devotion
of
heart
to
objects
thus
consecrated
very
perfections
but
widened
the
distance
between
us
and
all
that
most
kindled
my
passion
at
the
same
time
chilled
my
hopes
were
we
left
to
each
other
as
on
this
silent
river
in
this
undisturbed
communion
of
thoughts
and
feelings
i
knew
too
well
i
thought
both
her
nature
and
my
own
to
feel
a
doubt
that
love
would
ultimately
triumph
but
the
severity
of
the
guardianship
to
which
i
must
resign
her
monk
of
the
desert
some
stern
solitary
influence
such
a
monitor
would
gain
over
her
mind
and
the
horror
with
which
ere
long
she
would
be
taught
to
regard
the
reprobate
infidel
on
whom
she
now
smiled
all
this
prospect
i
saw
nothing
but
despair
after
a
few
short
hours
my
happiness
would
be
at
an
end
and
such
a
dark
chasm
open
between
our
fates
as
must
sever
them
far
as
earth
is
from
heaven
asunder
it
was
true
she
was
now
wholly
in
my
power
i
feared
no
witnesses
but
those
of
earth
and
the
solitude
of
the
desert
was
at
hand
but
though
i
acknowledged
not
a
heaven
i
worshipped
her
who
was
to
me
its
type
and
substitute
if
at
any
moment
a
single
thought
of
wrong
or
deceit
towards
a
creature
so
sacred
arose
in
my
mind
one
look
from
her
innocent
eyes
averted
the
sacrilege
even
passion
itself
felt
a
holy
fear
in
her
presence
the
flame
trembling
in
the
breeze
of
the
sanctuary
love
pure
love
stood
in
place
of
religion
as
long
as
i
knew
not
her
story
i
might
indulge
at
least
in
dreams
of
the
future
but
hope
what
prospect
remained
my
sole
chance
of
happiness
lay
in
the
feeble
hope
of
beguiling
away
her
thoughts
from
the
plan
which
she
meditated
of
weaning
her
by
persuasion
from
that
austere
faith
which
i
had
before
hated
and
now
feared
and
her
perhaps
alone
and
unlinked
as
she
was
in
the
world
to
my
own
fortunes
for
ever
in
the
agitation
of
these
thoughts
i
had
started
from
my
and
continued
to
pace
up
and
down
under
a
burning
sun
till
exhausted
both
by
thought
and
feeling
i
sunk
down
amid
its
blaze
into
a
sleep
which
to
my
fevered
brain
seemed
a
sleep
of
fire
on
awaking
i
found
the
veil
of
alethe
laid
carefully
over
my
brow
while
she
herself
sat
near
me
under
the
shadow
of
the
sail
looking
anxiously
at
that
leaf
which
her
mother
had
given
her
and
apparently
employed
in
comparing
its
outlines
with
the
course
of
the
river
and
the
forms
of
the
rocky
hills
by
which
we
passed
she
looked
pale
and
troubled
and
rose
eagerly
to
meet
me
as
if
she
had
long
and
impatiently
waited
for
my
waking
her
heart
it
was
plain
had
been
disturbed
from
its
security
and
was
beginning
to
take
alarm
at
its
own
feelings
but
though
vaguely
conscious
of
the
peril
to
which
she
was
exposed
her
reliance
as
is
usually
the
case
increased
with
her
danger
and
on
me
far
more
than
on
herself
did
she
depend
for
saving
her
from
it
to
reach
as
soon
as
possible
her
asylum
in
the
desert
was
now
the
urgent
object
of
her
entreaties
and
wishes
and
the
she
expressed
at
having
permitted
her
thoughts
to
be
diverted
for
a
single
moment
from
this
sacred
purpose
not
only
revealed
the
truth
that
she
had
forgotten
it
but
betrayed
even
a
glimmering
consciousness
of
the
cause
her
sleep
she
said
had
been
broken
by
dreams
every
moment
the
shade
of
her
mother
had
stood
before
her
rebuking
her
with
mournful
looks
for
her
delay
and
pointing
as
she
had
done
in
death
to
the
eastern
hills
bursting
into
tears
at
this
accusing
recollection
she
hastily
placed
the
leaf
which
she
had
been
examining
in
my
hands
and
implored
that
i
would
ascertain
without
a
delay
what
portion
of
our
voyage
was
still
unperformed
and
in
what
space
of
time
we
might
hope
to
accomplish
it
i
had
still
less
than
herself
taken
note
of
either
place
or
distance
and
had
we
been
left
to
glide
on
in
this
dream
of
happiness
should
never
have
thought
of
pausing
to
ask
where
it
would
end
but
such
confidence
i
felt
was
too
sacred
to
be
deceived
reluctant
as
i
was
naturally
to
enter
on
an
inquiry
which
might
so
soon
dissipate
even
my
last
hope
her
wish
was
sufficient
to
supersede
even
the
selfishness
of
love
and
on
the
instant
i
proceeded
to
obey
her
will
there
is
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
nile
to
the
north
of
antinöe
a
high
and
steep
rock
impending
over
the
flood
which
for
ages
from
a
prodigy
connected
with
it
has
borne
the
name
of
the
mountain
of
the
birds
yearly
it
is
said
at
a
certain
season
and
hour
large
flocks
of
birds
assemble
in
the
ravine
of
which
this
rocky
mountain
forms
one
of
the
sides
and
are
there
observed
to
go
through
the
mysterious
ceremony
of
inserting
each
its
beak
into
a
particular
cleft
of
the
rock
till
the
cleft
closes
upon
one
of
their
number
when
the
rest
taking
wing
leave
the
selected
victim
to
die
through
the
ravine
where
this
such
the
multitude
consider
worked
there
ran
in
ancient
times
a
canal
from
the
nile
to
some
great
and
forgotten
city
that
now
lies
buried
in
the
desert
to
a
short
distance
from
the
river
this
canal
still
exists
but
soon
after
having
passed
through
the
defile
its
scanty
waters
disappear
altogether
and
are
lost
under
the
sands
it
was
in
the
neighbourhood
of
this
place
as
i
could
collect
from
the
delineations
on
the
leaf
a
flight
of
birds
represented
the
name
of
the
mountain
the
dwelling
of
the
solitary
to
whom
alethe
was
bequeathed
lay
imperfect
as
was
my
knowledge
of
the
geography
of
egypt
it
at
once
struck
me
that
we
had
long
since
left
this
mountain
behind
and
on
inquiring
of
our
boatmen
i
found
my
conjecture
confirmed
we
had
indeed
passed
it
as
appeared
on
the
preceding
night
and
as
the
wind
had
ever
since
blown
strongly
from
the
north
and
the
sun
was
already
declining
towards
the
horizon
we
must
now
be
at
least
an
ordinary
sail
to
the
southward
of
the
spot
at
this
discovery
i
own
my
heart
felt
a
joy
which
i
could
with
difficulty
conceal
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
fortune
was
conspiring
with
love
and
by
thus
delaying
the
moment
of
our
separation
afforded
me
at
least
a
chance
of
happiness
her
look
too
and
manner
when
informed
of
our
mistake
rather
encouraged
than
chilled
this
secret
hope
in
the
first
moment
of
astonishment
her
eyes
opened
upon
me
with
a
suddenness
of
splendour
under
which
i
felt
my
own
wink
as
if
lightning
had
crossed
them
but
she
again
as
suddenly
let
their
lids
fall
and
after
a
quiver
of
her
lip
which
showed
the
conflict
of
feeling
within
crossed
her
arms
upon
her
bosom
and
looked
silently
down
upon
the
deck
whole
countenance
sinking
into
an
expression
sad
but
resigned
as
if
she
felt
with
me
that
fate
was
on
the
side
of
wrong
and
saw
love
already
stealing
between
her
soul
and
heaven
i
was
not
slow
in
availing
myself
of
what
i
fancied
to
be
the
irresolution
of
her
mind
but
fearful
of
exciting
alarm
by
any
appeal
to
tenderer
feelings
i
but
addressed
myself
to
her
imagination
and
to
that
love
of
novelty
which
is
for
ever
fresh
in
the
youthful
breast
we
were
now
approaching
that
region
of
wonders
thebes
a
day
or
two
said
i
shall
see
towering
above
the
waters
the
colossal
avenue
of
sphinxes
and
the
bright
obelisks
of
the
sun
we
shall
visit
the
plain
of
memnon
and
those
mighty
statues
that
fling
their
shadows
at
sunrise
over
the
libyan
hills
we
shall
hear
the
image
of
the
son
of
the
morning
answering
to
the
first
touch
of
light
from
thence
in
a
few
hours
a
breeze
like
this
will
transport
us
to
those
sunny
islands
near
the
cataracts
there
to
wander
among
the
sacred
of
philæ
or
sit
at
hour
in
those
cool
alcoves
which
the
waterfall
of
syene
shadows
under
its
arch
oh
who
with
such
scenes
of
loveliness
within
reach
would
turn
coldly
away
to
the
bleak
desert
and
leave
this
fair
world
with
all
its
enchantments
shining
behind
them
unseen
and
unenjoyed
at
least
added
tenderly
taking
her
by
the
hand
least
let
a
few
more
days
be
stolen
from
the
dreary
fate
to
which
thou
hast
devoted
thyself
and
she
had
heard
but
the
last
few
words
rest
had
been
lost
upon
her
startled
by
the
tone
of
tenderness
into
which
in
spite
of
all
my
resolves
my
voice
had
softened
she
looked
for
an
instant
in
my
face
with
passionate
earnestness
dropping
upon
her
knees
with
her
clasped
hands
upraised
me
not
in
the
name
of
god
i
implore
thee
tempt
me
not
to
swerve
from
my
sacred
duty
oh
take
me
instantly
to
that
desert
mountain
and
i
will
bless
thee
for
this
appeal
i
felt
be
resisted
my
heart
were
to
break
for
it
having
silently
expressed
my
assent
to
her
prayer
by
a
pressure
of
her
hand
as
i
raised
her
from
the
deck
i
hastened
as
we
were
still
in
full
career
for
the
south
to
give
orders
that
our
sail
should
be
instantly
lowered
and
not
a
moment
lost
in
retracing
our
course
in
proceeding
however
to
give
these
directions
it
for
the
first
time
occurred
to
me
that
as
i
had
hired
this
yacht
in
the
neighbourhood
of
memphis
where
it
was
probable
that
the
flight
of
the
young
fugitive
would
be
most
vigilantly
tracked
we
should
act
imprudently
in
betraying
to
the
boatmen
the
place
of
her
retreat
the
present
seemed
the
most
favourable
opportunity
of
evading
such
a
danger
desiring
therefore
that
we
should
be
landed
at
a
small
village
on
the
shore
under
pretence
of
paying
a
visit
to
some
shrine
in
the
neighbourhood
i
there
dismissed
our
barge
and
was
relieved
from
fear
of
further
observation
by
seeing
it
again
set
sail
and
resume
its
course
fleetly
up
the
current
from
the
boats
of
all
descriptions
that
lay
idle
beside
the
bank
i
now
selected
one
which
in
every
respect
suited
my
purpose
in
its
shape
and
accommodations
a
miniature
of
our
former
vessel
but
so
small
and
light
as
to
be
manageable
by
myself
alone
and
with
the
advantage
of
the
current
requiring
little
more
than
a
hand
to
steer
it
this
boat
i
succeeded
without
much
difficulty
in
purchasing
and
after
a
short
delay
we
were
again
afloat
down
the
current
sun
just
then
sinking
in
conscious
glory
over
his
own
golden
shrines
in
the
libyan
waste
the
evening
was
more
calm
and
lovely
than
any
that
yet
had
smiled
upon
our
voyage
and
as
we
left
the
bank
there
came
soothingly
over
our
ears
a
strain
of
sweet
rustic
melody
from
the
shore
it
was
the
voice
of
a
young
nubian
girl
whom
we
saw
kneeling
on
the
bank
before
an
acacia
and
singing
while
her
companions
stood
round
the
wild
song
of
invocation
which
in
her
country
they
address
to
that
enchanted
tree
abyssinian
tree
we
pray
we
pray
to
thee
by
the
glow
of
thy
golden
fruit
and
the
violet
hue
of
thy
flower
and
the
greeting
mute
of
thy
salute
to
the
stranger
who
seeks
thy
bower
ii
abyssinian
tree
how
the
traveller
blesses
thee
when
the
night
no
moon
allows
and
the
hour
is
near
and
thou
thy
boughs
to
kiss
his
brows
saying
rest
thee
oh
abyssinian
tree
thus
bow
thy
head
to
me
in
the
burden
of
this
song
the
companions
of
the
young
nubian
joined
and
we
heard
the
words
abyssinian
tree
dying
away
on
the
breeze
long
after
the
whole
group
had
been
lost
to
our
eyes
whether
in
this
new
arrangement
which
i
had
made
for
our
voyage
any
motive
besides
those
which
i
professed
had
a
share
i
can
scarcely
even
myself
so
bewildered
were
my
feelings
determine
but
no
sooner
had
the
current
borne
us
away
from
all
human
dwellings
and
we
were
alone
on
the
waters
with
not
a
soul
near
than
i
felt
how
closely
such
solitude
draws
hearts
together
and
how
much
more
we
seemed
to
belong
to
each
other
than
when
there
were
eyes
around
the
same
feeling
but
without
the
same
sense
of
its
danger
was
manifest
in
every
look
and
word
of
alethe
the
consciousness
of
the
one
great
effort
she
had
made
appeared
to
have
satisfied
her
heart
on
the
score
of
duty
the
devotedness
with
which
she
saw
i
attended
to
her
every
wish
was
felt
with
all
that
gratitude
which
in
woman
is
the
of
love
she
was
therefore
happy
innocently
happy
and
the
confiding
and
even
affectionate
unreserve
of
her
manner
while
it
rendered
my
trust
more
sacred
made
it
also
far
more
difficult
it
was
only
however
on
subjects
unconnected
with
our
situation
or
fate
that
she
yielded
to
such
interchange
of
thought
or
that
her
voice
ventured
to
answer
mine
the
moment
i
alluded
to
the
destiny
that
awaited
us
all
her
cheerfulness
fled
and
she
became
saddened
and
silent
when
i
described
to
her
the
beauty
of
my
own
native
founts
of
inspiration
and
fields
of
eyes
sparkled
with
sympathy
and
sometimes
even
softened
into
fondness
but
when
i
ventured
to
whisper
that
in
that
glorious
country
a
life
full
of
love
and
liberty
awaited
her
when
i
proceeded
to
contrast
the
adoration
and
bliss
she
might
command
with
the
gloomy
austerities
of
the
life
to
which
she
was
hastening
was
like
the
coming
of
a
sudden
cloud
over
a
summer
sky
her
head
sunk
as
she
listened
waited
in
vain
for
an
answer
and
when
half
playfully
reproaching
her
for
this
silence
i
stooped
to
take
her
hand
i
could
feel
the
warm
tears
fast
falling
over
it
but
even
hope
as
it
held
happiness
though
it
foreboded
that
i
should
lose
her
it
also
whispered
that
i
was
loved
like
that
lake
in
the
land
of
roses
whose
waters
are
half
sweet
half
bitter
i
felt
my
fate
to
be
a
compound
of
bliss
and
pain
the
very
pain
well
worth
all
ordinary
bliss
and
thus
did
the
hours
of
that
night
pass
along
while
every
moment
shortened
our
happy
dream
and
the
current
seemed
to
flow
with
a
swifter
pace
than
any
that
ever
yet
hurried
to
the
sea
not
a
feature
of
the
whole
scene
but
is
at
this
moment
freshly
in
my
memory
broken
on
the
water
rippling
sound
of
the
boat
as
without
oar
or
sail
it
went
like
a
thing
of
enchantment
down
the
stream
scented
fire
burning
beside
us
on
the
deck
and
oh
that
face
on
which
its
light
fell
still
revealing
as
it
turned
some
new
charm
some
blush
or
look
more
beautiful
than
the
last
often
while
i
sat
gazing
forgetful
of
all
else
in
this
world
our
boat
left
wholly
to
itself
would
drive
from
its
course
and
bearing
us
to
the
bank
get
entangled
in
the
or
be
caught
in
some
eddy
ere
i
perceived
where
we
were
once
too
when
the
rustling
of
my
oar
among
the
flowers
had
startled
away
from
the
bank
some
wild
antelopes
that
had
stolen
at
that
still
hour
to
drink
of
the
nile
what
an
emblem
i
thought
it
of
the
young
heart
beside
me
for
the
first
time
of
hope
and
love
and
so
soon
alas
to
be
scared
from
their
sweetness
for
ever
chap
xv
the
night
was
now
far
advanced
bend
of
our
course
towards
the
left
and
the
closing
in
of
the
eastern
hills
upon
the
river
gave
warning
of
our
approach
to
the
dwelling
every
minute
now
seemed
like
the
last
of
existence
and
i
felt
a
sinking
of
despair
at
my
heart
which
would
have
been
intolerable
had
not
a
resolution
that
suddenly
and
as
if
by
inspiration
occurred
to
me
presented
a
glimpse
of
hope
which
in
some
degree
calmed
my
feelings
much
as
i
had
all
my
life
despised
hypocrisy
very
sect
i
had
embraced
being
chiefly
recommended
to
me
by
the
war
which
they
waged
on
the
cant
of
all
others
was
nevertheless
in
hypocrisy
that
i
now
scrupled
not
to
take
refuge
from
what
i
dreaded
more
than
shame
or
death
my
separation
from
alethe
in
my
despair
i
adopted
the
humiliating
humiliating
as
i
felt
it
to
be
even
amid
the
joy
with
which
i
welcomed
offering
myself
to
this
hermit
as
a
convert
to
his
faith
and
thus
becoming
the
of
alethe
under
his
care
from
the
moment
i
resolved
upon
this
plan
my
spirit
felt
lightened
though
having
fully
before
my
eyes
the
labyrinth
of
imposture
into
which
it
would
lead
me
i
thought
of
nothing
but
the
chance
of
our
being
still
together
this
hope
all
pride
all
philosophy
was
forgotten
and
every
thing
seemed
tolerable
but
the
prospect
of
losing
her
thus
resolved
it
was
with
somewhat
less
reluctant
feelings
that
i
now
undertook
at
the
anxious
desire
of
alethe
to
ascertain
the
site
of
that
mountain
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
the
dwelling
of
the
anchoret
lay
we
had
already
passed
one
or
two
stupendous
rocks
which
stood
detached
like
fortresses
over
the
brink
and
which
in
some
degree
corresponded
with
the
description
on
the
leaf
so
little
was
there
of
life
now
stirring
along
the
shores
that
i
had
begun
almost
to
despair
of
any
assistance
from
inquiry
when
on
looking
to
the
western
bank
i
saw
a
boatman
among
the
sedges
towing
his
small
boat
with
some
difficulty
up
the
current
hailing
him
as
we
passed
i
asked
stands
the
mountain
of
the
birds
he
had
hardly
time
to
answer
pointing
above
our
heads
when
we
perceived
that
we
were
just
then
entering
into
the
shadow
which
this
mighty
rock
flings
across
the
whole
of
the
flood
in
a
few
moments
we
had
reached
the
mouth
of
the
ravine
of
which
the
mountain
of
the
birds
forms
one
of
the
sides
and
through
which
the
scanty
canal
from
the
nile
flows
at
the
sight
of
this
chasm
in
some
of
whose
gloomy
we
had
rightly
interpreted
the
dwelling
of
the
solitary
lay
our
voices
at
once
sunk
into
a
low
whisper
while
alethe
looked
round
upon
me
with
a
superstitious
fearfulness
as
if
doubtful
whether
i
had
not
already
disappeared
from
her
side
a
quick
movement
however
of
her
hand
towards
the
ravine
told
too
plainly
that
her
purpose
was
still
unchanged
with
my
oars
therefore
checking
the
career
of
our
boat
i
succeeded
after
no
small
exertion
in
turning
it
out
of
the
current
of
the
river
and
steering
into
this
bleak
and
stagnant
canal
our
transition
from
life
and
bloom
to
the
very
depth
of
desolation
was
immediate
while
the
water
and
one
side
of
the
ravine
lay
buried
in
shadow
the
white
crags
of
the
other
stood
aloft
in
the
pale
glare
of
moonlight
the
sluggish
stream
through
which
we
moved
yielded
sullenly
to
the
oar
and
the
shriek
of
a
few
which
we
had
roused
from
their
fastnesses
was
succeeded
by
a
silence
so
dead
and
awful
that
our
lips
seemed
afraid
to
disturb
it
by
a
breath
and
whispered
exclamations
dreary
dismal
almost
the
only
words
exchanged
between
us
we
had
proceeded
for
some
time
through
this
gloomy
defile
when
at
a
distance
before
us
among
the
rocks
on
which
the
moonlight
fell
we
perceived
upon
a
ledge
but
little
elevated
above
the
canal
a
small
hut
or
cave
which
from
a
tree
or
two
planted
around
it
had
some
appearance
of
being
the
abode
of
a
human
being
then
thought
i
the
home
to
which
alethe
is
destined
chill
of
despair
came
again
over
my
heart
and
the
oars
as
i
gazed
lay
motionless
in
my
hands
i
found
alethe
too
whose
eyes
had
caught
the
same
object
drawing
closer
to
my
side
than
she
had
yet
ventured
laying
her
hand
agitatedly
upon
mine
must
here
she
said
for
i
turned
to
her
as
she
spoke
there
was
a
tenderness
a
despondency
in
her
countenance
that
at
once
saddened
and
inflamed
my
soul
i
exclaimed
passionately
same
god
shall
receive
us
both
thy
faith
alethe
shall
from
this
hour
be
mine
and
i
will
live
and
die
in
this
desert
with
thee
her
surprise
her
delight
at
these
words
was
like
a
momentary
delirium
the
wild
anxious
smile
with
which
she
looked
into
my
face
as
if
to
ascertain
whether
she
had
indeed
heard
my
words
aright
bespoke
a
happiness
too
much
for
reason
to
bear
at
length
the
fulness
of
her
heart
found
relief
in
tears
and
murmuring
forth
an
incoherent
blessing
on
my
name
she
let
her
head
fall
languidly
and
powerlessly
on
my
arm
the
light
from
our
shone
upon
her
face
i
saw
her
eyes
which
she
had
closed
for
a
moment
again
opening
upon
me
with
the
same
tenderness
providence
how
i
remember
that
moment
on
the
point
of
bending
down
my
lips
towards
hers
when
suddenly
in
the
air
above
our
heads
as
if
it
came
from
heaven
there
burst
forth
a
strain
from
a
choir
of
voices
that
with
its
solemn
sweetness
filled
the
whole
valley
breaking
away
from
my
caress
at
these
supernatural
sounds
the
maiden
threw
herself
trembling
upon
her
knees
and
not
daring
to
look
up
exclaimed
wildly
mother
oh
my
mother
it
was
the
morning
hymn
that
we
heard
same
as
i
learned
afterwards
that
on
their
high
terrace
at
memphis
alethe
had
been
often
taught
by
her
mother
to
sing
to
the
rising
sun
scarcely
less
startled
than
my
companion
i
looked
up
and
at
the
very
summit
of
the
rock
above
us
saw
a
light
appearing
to
come
from
a
small
opening
or
window
through
which
also
the
sounds
that
had
appeared
so
supernatural
issued
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
we
had
now
not
the
dwelling
of
the
least
the
haunt
of
some
of
the
christian
brotherhood
of
these
rocks
by
whose
assistance
we
could
not
fail
to
find
the
place
of
his
retreat
the
agitation
into
which
alethe
had
been
thrown
by
the
first
burst
of
that
psalmody
soon
yielded
to
the
softening
recollections
which
it
brought
back
and
a
calm
came
over
her
brow
such
as
it
had
never
before
worn
since
our
meeting
she
seemed
to
feel
that
she
had
now
reached
her
destined
haven
and
to
hail
as
the
voice
of
heaven
itself
those
sounds
by
which
she
was
welcomed
to
it
in
her
tranquillity
however
i
could
not
now
sympathize
impatient
to
know
all
that
awaited
her
and
myself
i
pushed
our
boat
close
to
the
base
of
the
rock
under
that
lighted
window
on
the
summit
to
find
my
way
up
to
which
was
my
first
object
having
hastily
received
my
instructions
from
alethe
and
made
her
repeat
again
the
name
of
the
christian
whom
we
sought
i
sprang
upon
the
bank
and
was
not
long
in
discovering
a
sort
of
rude
cut
out
of
the
rock
but
leading
i
found
by
easy
windings
up
the
steep
after
ascending
for
some
time
i
arrived
at
a
level
space
or
ledge
which
the
hand
of
labour
had
succeeded
in
converting
into
a
garden
and
which
was
planted
here
and
there
with
and
palms
around
it
too
i
could
perceive
through
the
glimmering
light
a
number
of
small
caves
or
grottos
into
some
of
which
human
beings
might
find
entrance
while
others
appeared
no
larger
than
the
tombs
of
the
sacred
birds
round
lake
mœris
i
was
still
i
found
but
up
the
ascent
to
the
summit
nor
could
perceive
any
further
means
of
continuing
my
course
as
the
mountain
from
hence
rose
almost
perpendicularly
like
a
wall
at
length
however
on
exploring
around
i
discovered
behind
the
shade
of
a
sycamore
a
large
ladder
of
wood
resting
firmly
against
the
rock
and
affording
an
easy
and
secure
ascent
up
the
steep
having
ascertained
thus
far
i
again
descended
to
the
boat
for
alethe
i
found
trembling
already
at
her
short
solitude
having
led
her
up
the
steps
to
this
quiet
garden
left
her
safely
lodged
amid
its
holy
silence
while
i
pursued
my
way
upward
to
the
light
on
the
rock
at
the
top
of
the
long
ladder
i
found
myself
on
another
ledge
or
platform
somewhat
smaller
than
the
first
but
planted
in
the
same
manner
with
trees
and
as
i
could
perceive
by
the
mingled
light
of
morning
and
the
moon
embellished
with
flowers
i
was
now
near
the
summit
remained
but
another
short
ascent
and
as
a
ladder
against
the
rock
as
before
supplied
the
means
of
scaling
it
i
was
in
a
few
minutes
at
the
opening
from
which
the
light
issued
i
had
ascended
gently
as
well
from
a
feeling
of
awe
at
the
whole
scene
as
from
an
unwillingness
to
disturb
too
rudely
the
rites
on
which
i
intruded
my
approach
was
therefore
unheard
and
an
opportunity
during
some
moments
afforded
me
of
observing
the
group
within
before
my
appearance
at
the
window
was
discovered
in
the
middle
of
the
apartment
which
seemed
once
to
have
been
a
pagan
oratory
there
was
an
assembly
of
seven
or
eight
persons
some
male
some
female
kneeling
in
silence
round
a
small
altar
among
them
as
if
presiding
over
their
ceremony
stood
an
aged
man
who
at
the
moment
of
my
arrival
was
presenting
to
one
of
the
female
worshippers
an
alabaster
cup
which
she
applied
with
much
reverence
to
her
lips
on
the
countenance
of
the
venerable
minister
as
he
pronounced
a
short
prayer
over
her
head
there
was
an
expression
of
profound
feeling
that
showed
how
wholly
he
was
absorbed
in
that
rite
and
when
she
had
drank
of
the
cup
i
saw
had
engraven
on
its
side
the
image
of
a
head
with
a
glory
round
it
holy
man
bent
down
and
kissed
her
forehead
after
this
parting
salutation
the
whole
group
rose
silently
from
their
knees
and
it
was
then
for
the
first
time
that
by
a
cry
of
terror
from
one
of
the
women
the
appearance
of
a
stranger
at
the
window
was
discovered
the
whole
assembly
seemed
startled
and
alarmed
except
him
that
superior
person
who
advancing
from
the
altar
with
an
unmoved
look
raised
the
latch
of
the
door
which
was
adjoining
to
the
window
and
admitted
me
there
was
in
this
old
features
a
mixture
of
elevation
and
sweetness
of
simplicity
and
energy
which
commanded
at
once
attachment
and
homage
and
half
hoping
half
fearing
to
find
in
him
the
destined
guardian
of
alethe
i
looked
anxiously
in
his
face
as
i
entered
and
pronounced
the
name
is
my
name
young
stranger
he
answered
whether
in
friendship
or
in
enmity
thou
comest
melanius
blesses
thus
saying
he
made
a
sign
with
his
right
hand
above
my
head
while
with
involuntary
respect
i
bowed
beneath
the
benediction
this
volume
i
replied
for
the
peacefulness
of
my
mission
the
same
time
placing
in
his
hands
the
copy
of
the
scriptures
which
had
been
his
own
gift
to
the
mother
of
alethe
and
which
her
child
now
brought
as
the
credential
of
her
claims
on
his
protection
at
the
sight
of
this
sacred
pledge
which
he
recognized
instantly
the
solemnity
that
had
marked
his
first
reception
of
me
softened
into
tenderness
thoughts
of
other
times
seemed
to
pass
through
his
mind
and
as
with
a
sigh
of
recollection
he
took
the
book
from
my
hands
some
words
on
the
outer
leaf
caught
his
eye
they
were
few
contained
perhaps
the
last
wishes
of
the
dying
theora
for
as
he
eagerly
read
them
over
i
saw
the
tears
in
his
aged
eyes
trust
he
said
with
a
faltering
voice
sacred
and
god
will
i
hope
enable
his
servant
to
guard
it
during
this
short
dialogue
the
other
persons
of
the
assembly
had
as
i
afterwards
learned
brethren
from
the
neighbouring
bank
of
the
nile
who
came
thus
secretly
before
to
join
in
worshipping
god
fearful
lest
their
descent
down
the
rock
might
alarm
alethe
i
hurried
briefly
over
the
few
words
of
explanation
that
remained
and
leaving
the
venerable
christian
to
follow
at
his
leisure
hastened
anxiously
down
to
rejoin
the
maiden
chap
xvi
melanius
was
among
the
first
of
those
christians
of
egypt
who
after
the
recent
example
of
the
hermit
paul
renouncing
all
the
comforts
of
social
existence
betook
themselves
to
a
life
of
contemplation
in
the
desert
less
selfish
however
in
his
piety
than
most
of
these
ascetics
melanius
forgot
not
the
world
in
leaving
it
he
knew
that
man
was
not
born
to
live
wholly
for
himself
that
his
relation
to
human
kind
was
that
of
the
link
to
the
chain
and
that
even
his
solitude
should
be
turned
to
the
advantage
of
others
in
flying
therefore
from
the
din
and
disturbance
of
life
he
sought
not
to
place
himself
beyond
the
reach
of
its
sympathies
but
selected
a
retreat
where
he
could
combine
the
advantage
of
solitude
with
those
opportunities
of
serving
his
which
a
neighbourhood
to
their
haunts
would
afford
that
taste
for
the
gloom
of
subterranean
recesses
which
the
race
of
misraim
inherit
from
their
ethiopian
ancestors
had
by
hollowing
out
all
egypt
into
caverns
and
crypts
furnished
these
christian
anchorets
with
a
choice
of
retreats
accordingly
some
found
a
shelter
in
the
grottos
of
elethya
among
the
royal
tombs
of
the
thebaïd
in
the
middle
of
the
seven
valleys
where
the
sun
rarely
shines
a
few
have
fixed
their
dim
and
melancholy
retreat
while
others
have
sought
the
neighbourhood
of
the
red
lakes
of
nitria
and
there
those
pagan
solitaries
of
old
who
dwelt
among
the
near
the
dead
sea
amid
the
sterility
of
nature
and
seem
to
find
in
her
desolation
peace
it
was
on
one
of
the
mountains
of
the
saïd
to
the
east
of
the
river
that
melanius
as
we
have
seen
chose
his
place
of
seclusion
the
life
and
fertility
of
the
nile
on
the
one
side
and
the
lone
dismal
barrenness
of
the
desert
on
the
other
down
this
mountain
where
it
impends
over
the
ravine
he
found
a
series
of
caves
or
grottos
dug
out
of
the
rock
which
had
in
other
times
ministered
to
some
purpose
of
mystery
but
whose
use
had
been
long
forgotten
and
their
recesses
abandoned
to
this
place
after
the
banishment
of
his
great
master
origen
melanius
with
a
few
faithful
followers
retired
and
by
the
example
of
his
innocent
life
no
less
than
by
his
fervid
eloquence
succeeded
in
winning
crowds
of
converts
to
his
faith
placed
as
he
was
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
rich
city
antinoë
though
he
mingled
not
with
its
multitude
his
name
and
his
fame
were
among
them
and
to
all
who
sought
instruction
or
consolation
the
cell
of
the
hermit
was
ever
open
notwithstanding
the
rigid
abstinence
of
his
own
habits
he
was
yet
careful
to
provide
for
the
comforts
of
others
contented
with
a
rude
bed
of
straw
himself
for
the
stranger
he
had
always
a
less
homely
from
his
grotto
the
wayfaring
and
the
indigent
never
went
unrefreshed
and
with
the
assistance
of
some
of
his
brethren
he
had
formed
gardens
along
the
ledges
of
the
mountain
which
gave
an
air
of
cheerfulness
to
his
rocky
dwelling
and
supplied
him
with
the
chief
necessaries
of
such
a
climate
fruit
and
shade
though
the
acquaintance
which
he
had
formed
with
the
mother
of
alethe
during
the
short
period
of
her
attendance
at
the
school
of
origen
was
soon
interrupted
and
never
afterwards
renewed
the
interest
which
he
had
then
taken
in
her
fate
was
too
lively
to
be
forgotten
he
had
seen
the
zeal
with
which
her
young
heart
welcomed
instruction
and
the
thought
that
such
a
candidate
for
heaven
should
have
relapsed
into
idolatry
came
often
with
disquieting
apprehension
over
his
mind
it
was
therefore
with
true
pleasure
that
but
a
year
or
two
before
her
death
he
had
learned
by
a
private
communication
from
theora
transmitted
through
a
christian
embalmer
of
memphis
that
only
her
own
heart
had
taken
root
in
the
faith
but
that
a
new
bud
had
flowered
with
the
same
divine
hope
and
that
ere
long
he
might
see
them
both
transplanted
to
the
the
coming
therefore
of
alethe
was
far
less
a
surprise
to
him
than
her
coming
thus
alone
was
a
shock
and
a
sorrow
and
the
silence
of
their
meeting
showed
how
deeply
each
remembered
that
the
tie
which
had
brought
them
together
was
no
longer
of
this
world
the
hand
which
should
have
been
joined
with
theirs
was
in
the
tomb
i
now
saw
that
not
even
religion
was
proof
against
the
sadness
of
mortality
for
as
the
old
man
put
the
ringlets
aside
from
her
forehead
and
contemplated
in
that
clear
countenance
the
reflection
of
what
her
mother
had
been
there
was
a
mournfulness
mingled
with
his
piety
as
he
said
rest
her
soul
which
showed
how
little
even
the
certainty
of
a
heaven
for
those
we
love
can
subdue
our
regret
for
having
lost
them
on
earth
the
full
light
of
day
had
now
risen
upon
the
desert
and
our
host
reminded
by
the
faint
looks
of
alethe
of
the
many
anxious
hours
we
had
passed
without
sleep
proposed
that
we
should
seek
in
the
chambers
of
the
rock
such
rest
as
the
dwelling
of
a
hermit
could
offer
pointing
to
one
of
the
largest
openings
as
he
addressed
me
wilt
find
he
said
that
grotto
a
bed
of
fresh
doum
leaves
and
may
the
consciousness
of
having
protected
the
orphan
sweeten
thy
sleep
i
felt
how
dearly
this
praise
had
been
earned
and
already
almost
repented
of
having
deserved
it
there
was
a
sadness
in
the
countenance
of
alethe
as
i
took
leave
of
her
to
which
the
forebodings
of
my
own
heart
but
too
faithfully
responded
nor
could
i
help
fearing
as
her
hand
parted
lingeringly
from
mine
that
i
had
by
this
sacrifice
placed
her
beyond
my
reach
for
ever
having
lighted
me
a
lamp
which
in
these
recesses
even
at
noon
is
necessary
the
holy
man
led
me
to
the
entrance
of
the
grotto
here
i
blush
to
say
my
career
of
hypocrisy
began
with
the
sole
view
of
obtaining
another
glance
at
alethe
i
turned
humbly
to
solicit
the
benediction
of
the
christian
and
having
conveyed
to
her
as
i
bent
reverently
down
as
much
of
the
deep
feeling
of
my
soul
as
looks
could
express
with
a
desponding
spirit
i
hurried
into
the
cavern
a
short
passage
led
me
to
the
chamber
within
walls
of
which
i
found
covered
like
those
of
the
grottos
of
lycopolis
with
paintings
which
though
executed
long
ages
ago
looked
fresh
as
if
their
colours
were
but
laid
on
yesterday
they
were
all
of
them
representations
of
rural
and
domestic
scenes
and
in
the
greater
number
the
melancholy
imagination
of
the
artist
had
called
death
in
as
usual
to
throw
his
shadow
over
the
picture
my
attention
was
particularly
drawn
to
one
series
of
subjects
throughout
the
whole
of
which
the
same
youth
a
maiden
and
two
aged
persons
who
appeared
to
be
the
father
and
mother
of
the
girl
represented
in
all
the
details
of
their
daily
life
the
looks
and
attitudes
of
the
young
people
denoted
that
they
were
lovers
and
sometimes
they
were
seen
sitting
under
a
canopy
of
flowers
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
each
faces
as
though
they
could
never
look
away
sometimes
they
appeared
walking
along
the
banks
of
the
nile
one
of
those
sweet
nights
when
isis
the
pure
star
of
lovers
lights
her
bridal
crescent
the
holy
stream
when
wandering
youths
and
maidens
watch
her
beam
and
number
the
nights
she
hath
to
run
ere
she
again
embrace
her
bridegroom
sun
through
all
these
scenes
of
endearment
the
two
elder
persons
stood
by
calm
countenances
touched
with
a
share
of
that
bliss
in
whose
perfect
light
the
young
lovers
were
basking
thus
far
all
was
happiness
the
sad
lesson
of
mortality
was
to
come
in
the
last
picture
of
the
series
one
of
the
figures
was
missing
it
was
that
of
the
young
maiden
who
had
disappeared
from
among
them
on
the
brink
of
a
dark
lake
stood
the
three
who
remained
while
a
boat
just
departing
for
the
city
of
the
dead
told
too
plainly
the
end
of
their
dream
of
happiness
this
memorial
of
a
sorrow
of
other
a
sorrow
ancient
as
death
itself
not
wanting
to
deepen
the
melancholy
of
my
mind
or
to
add
to
the
weight
of
the
many
bodings
that
pressed
on
it
after
a
night
as
it
seemed
of
anxious
and
unsleeping
thought
i
rose
from
my
bed
and
returned
to
the
garden
i
found
the
christian
alone
under
the
shade
of
one
of
his
trees
at
a
small
table
with
a
volume
unrolled
before
him
while
a
beautiful
antelope
lay
sleeping
at
his
feet
struck
forcibly
by
the
contrast
which
he
presented
to
those
haughty
priests
whom
i
had
seen
surrounded
by
the
pomp
and
gorgeousness
of
temples
this
then
thought
i
faith
before
which
the
world
temple
the
desert
its
treasury
a
book
and
its
high
priest
the
solitary
dweller
of
the
rock
he
had
prepared
for
me
a
simple
but
hospitable
repast
of
which
fruits
from
his
own
garden
the
white
bread
of
olyra
and
the
juice
of
the
cane
were
the
most
costly
luxuries
his
manner
to
me
was
even
more
cordial
than
before
but
the
absence
of
alethe
and
still
more
the
ominous
reserve
with
which
he
not
only
himself
refrained
from
all
mention
of
her
name
but
eluded
the
few
inquiries
by
which
i
sought
to
lead
to
it
seemed
to
confirm
all
the
fears
i
had
felt
in
parting
from
her
she
had
acquainted
him
it
was
evident
with
the
whole
history
of
our
flight
my
reputation
as
a
desire
to
become
a
was
already
known
to
the
zealous
anchoret
and
the
subject
of
my
conversion
was
the
very
first
on
which
he
entered
o
pride
of
philosophy
how
wert
thou
then
humbled
and
with
what
shame
did
i
stand
casting
down
my
eyes
before
that
venerable
man
as
with
ingenuous
trust
in
the
sincerity
of
my
intention
he
welcomed
me
to
a
participation
of
his
holy
hope
and
imprinted
the
kiss
of
charity
on
my
infidel
brow
embarrassed
as
i
felt
by
the
consciousness
of
hypocrisy
i
was
even
still
more
perplexed
by
my
total
ignorance
of
the
real
tenets
of
the
faith
to
which
i
professed
myself
a
convert
abashed
and
confused
and
with
a
heart
sick
at
its
own
deceit
i
heard
the
animated
and
eloquent
gratulations
of
the
christian
as
though
they
were
words
in
a
dream
without
link
or
meaning
nor
could
disguise
but
by
the
mockery
of
a
reverential
bow
at
every
pause
the
entire
want
of
and
even
of
speech
under
which
i
laboured
a
few
minutes
more
of
such
trial
and
i
must
have
avowed
my
imposture
but
the
holy
man
saw
my
embarrassment
whether
mistaking
it
for
awe
or
knowing
it
to
be
ignorance
relieved
me
from
my
perplexity
by
at
once
changing
the
theme
having
gently
awakened
his
antelope
from
its
sleep
have
heard
he
said
doubt
not
of
my
paul
who
from
his
cave
in
the
marble
mountains
near
the
red
sea
sends
hourly
sacrifice
of
to
heaven
of
walks
they
tell
me
a
lion
is
the
companion
but
for
me
he
added
with
a
playful
and
significant
smile
try
my
powers
of
taming
but
on
the
gentler
animals
this
feeble
child
of
the
desert
is
a
far
fitter
then
taking
his
staff
and
putting
the
volume
which
he
had
been
reading
into
a
large
pouch
that
hung
by
his
side
will
now
said
he
thee
over
my
rocky
kingdom
thou
mayst
see
in
what
drear
and
barren
places
that
of
the
spirit
peace
may
be
to
speak
of
peace
to
a
heart
like
mine
at
that
moment
was
like
talking
of
some
distant
harbour
to
the
mariner
sinking
at
sea
in
vain
did
i
look
round
for
some
sign
of
alethe
vain
make
an
effort
even
to
utter
her
name
consciousness
of
my
own
deceit
as
well
as
a
fear
of
awakening
in
melanius
any
suspicion
that
might
frustrate
my
only
hope
threw
a
fetter
over
my
spirit
and
checked
my
tongue
in
silence
therefore
i
followed
while
the
cheerful
old
man
with
slow
but
firm
step
ascended
the
rock
by
the
same
ladders
which
i
had
mounted
on
the
preceding
night
during
the
time
when
the
decian
persecution
was
raging
many
christians
of
this
neighbourhood
he
informed
me
had
taken
refuge
under
his
protection
in
these
grottos
and
the
chapel
on
the
summit
where
i
had
found
them
at
prayer
was
in
those
times
of
danger
their
place
of
retreat
where
by
drawing
up
these
ladders
they
were
enabled
to
secure
themselves
from
pursuit
from
the
top
of
the
rock
the
view
on
either
side
embraced
the
two
extremes
of
fertility
and
desolation
nor
could
the
epicurean
and
the
anchoret
who
now
gazed
from
that
height
be
at
any
loss
to
indulge
their
respective
tastes
between
the
living
luxuriance
of
the
world
on
one
side
and
the
dead
repose
of
the
desert
on
the
other
when
we
turned
to
the
river
what
a
picture
of
animation
presented
itself
near
us
to
the
south
were
the
graceful
colonnades
of
antinoë
its
proud
populous
streets
and
triumphal
monuments
on
the
opposite
shore
rich
plains
teeming
with
cultivation
to
the
edge
offered
up
as
from
verdant
altars
their
fruits
to
the
sun
while
beneath
us
the
nile
glorious
stream
that
late
between
its
banks
was
seen
to
glide
with
shrines
and
marble
cities
on
each
side
glittering
like
jewels
strung
along
a
chain
had
now
sent
forth
its
waters
and
plain
and
valley
like
a
giant
from
his
bed
rising
with
limbs
superbly
spread
from
this
scene
on
one
side
of
the
mountain
we
had
but
to
turn
round
our
eyes
and
it
was
as
if
nature
herself
had
become
suddenly
extinct
wide
waste
of
sands
bleak
and
interminable
wearying
out
the
sun
with
its
sameness
of
desolation
rocks
that
stood
as
barriers
at
which
life
stopped
the
only
signs
of
animation
past
or
present
were
the
here
and
there
of
an
antelope
or
ostrich
or
the
bones
of
dead
camels
as
they
lay
whitening
at
a
distance
marking
out
the
track
of
the
caravans
over
the
waste
after
listening
while
he
contrasted
in
a
few
eloquent
words
the
two
regions
of
life
and
death
on
whose
confines
we
stood
i
again
descended
with
my
guide
to
the
garden
we
had
left
from
thence
turning
into
a
path
along
the
he
conducted
me
to
another
row
of
grottos
facing
the
desert
which
had
once
he
said
been
the
abode
of
those
brethren
in
christ
who
had
fled
with
him
to
this
solitude
from
the
crowded
world
which
death
had
within
a
few
months
rendered
tenantless
a
cross
of
red
stone
and
a
few
faded
trees
were
the
only
traces
these
solitaries
had
left
behind
a
silence
of
some
minutes
succeeded
while
we
descended
to
the
edge
of
the
canal
and
i
saw
opposite
among
the
rocks
that
solitary
cave
which
had
so
chilled
me
with
its
aspect
on
the
preceding
night
by
the
bank
we
found
one
of
those
rustic
boats
which
the
egyptians
construct
of
planks
of
wild
thorn
bound
rudely
together
with
bands
of
papyrus
placing
ourselves
in
this
boat
and
rather
impelling
than
rowing
it
across
we
made
our
way
through
the
foul
and
shallow
flood
and
landed
directly
under
the
site
of
the
cave
this
dwelling
as
i
have
already
mentioned
was
situated
upon
a
ledge
of
the
rock
and
being
provided
with
a
sort
of
window
or
aperture
to
admit
the
light
of
heaven
was
accounted
i
found
more
cheerful
than
the
grottos
on
the
other
side
of
the
ravine
but
there
was
a
dreariness
in
the
whole
region
around
to
which
light
only
lent
more
horror
the
dead
whiteness
of
the
rocks
as
they
stood
like
ghosts
in
the
sunshine
melancholy
pool
half
lost
in
the
sands
gave
me
the
idea
of
a
wasting
world
to
dwell
in
such
a
place
seemed
to
me
like
a
living
death
and
when
the
christian
as
we
entered
the
cave
said
is
to
be
thy
home
prepared
as
i
was
for
the
worst
my
resolution
gave
way
feeling
of
disappointed
passion
and
humbled
pride
which
had
been
gathering
round
my
heart
for
the
last
few
hours
found
a
vent
at
once
and
i
burst
into
tears
well
accustomed
to
human
weakness
and
perhaps
guessing
at
some
of
the
sources
of
mine
the
good
hermit
without
appearing
to
notice
this
emotion
expatiated
with
a
cheerful
air
on
what
he
called
the
many
comforts
of
my
dwelling
sheltered
he
said
from
the
dry
burning
wind
of
the
south
my
porch
would
inhale
the
fresh
breeze
of
the
fruits
from
his
own
should
furnish
my
repast
the
well
of
the
neighbouring
rock
would
supply
my
beverage
and
he
continued
his
voice
into
a
more
solemn
tone
as
he
placed
upon
the
table
the
volume
which
he
had
brought
my
son
is
that
of
living
waters
in
which
alone
thou
wilt
find
lasting
refreshment
or
peace
thus
saying
he
descended
the
rock
to
his
boat
and
after
a
few
plashes
of
his
oar
had
died
upon
my
ear
the
solitude
and
silence
around
me
was
complete
chap
xvii
what
a
fate
was
mine
a
few
weeks
since
presiding
over
that
splendid
festival
of
the
garden
with
all
the
luxuries
of
existence
tributary
in
my
train
and
now
into
a
solitary
outcast
hypocritical
pupil
of
a
christian
anchoret
even
the
excuse
of
fanaticism
or
of
any
other
madness
but
that
of
love
wild
love
to
extenuate
my
fall
were
there
a
hope
that
by
this
humiliating
waste
of
existence
i
might
purchase
but
a
glimpse
now
and
then
of
alethe
even
the
depths
of
the
desert
with
such
a
chance
would
be
welcome
but
to
live
her
was
a
misery
which
i
neither
foresaw
nor
could
endure
hating
even
to
look
upon
the
den
to
which
i
was
doomed
i
hurried
out
into
the
air
and
found
my
way
along
the
rocks
to
the
desert
the
sun
was
going
down
with
that
hue
which
he
so
frequently
wears
in
this
clime
at
his
setting
i
saw
the
sands
stretching
out
like
a
sea
to
the
horizon
as
if
their
waste
extended
to
the
very
verge
of
the
world
in
the
bitterness
of
my
feelings
rejoiced
to
see
so
much
of
creation
rescued
even
by
this
barren
liberty
from
the
grasp
of
man
the
thought
seemed
to
relieve
my
wounded
pride
and
as
i
wandered
over
the
dim
and
boundless
solitude
to
be
thus
free
even
amid
blight
and
desolation
appeared
a
blessing
the
only
living
thing
i
saw
was
a
restless
swallow
whose
wings
were
of
the
hue
of
the
grey
sands
over
which
he
fluttered
may
not
the
mind
like
this
bird
take
the
colour
of
the
desert
and
sympathise
in
its
austerity
its
freedom
and
its
calm
between
despondence
and
defiance
did
i
ask
myself
endeavouring
to
face
with
fortitude
what
yet
my
heart
sickened
to
contemplate
but
the
effort
was
unavailing
overcome
by
that
vast
solitude
whose
repose
was
not
the
slumber
of
peace
but
the
sullen
and
burning
silence
of
hate
i
felt
my
spirit
give
way
and
even
love
itself
yield
to
despair
seating
myself
on
a
fragment
of
a
rock
and
covering
my
eyes
with
my
hands
i
made
an
effort
to
shut
out
the
overwhelming
prospect
but
in
was
still
before
me
deepened
by
all
that
fancy
could
add
and
when
again
looking
up
i
saw
the
last
red
ray
of
the
sun
shooting
across
that
melancholy
and
lifeless
waste
it
seemed
to
me
like
the
light
of
the
comet
that
once
desolated
this
world
shining
out
luridly
over
the
ruin
that
it
had
made
appalled
by
my
own
gloomy
imaginations
i
turned
towards
the
ravine
and
notwithstanding
the
disgust
with
which
i
had
left
my
dwelling
was
not
ill
pleased
to
find
my
way
over
the
rocks
to
it
again
on
approaching
the
cave
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
a
light
within
at
such
a
moment
any
vestige
of
life
was
welcome
and
i
hailed
the
unexpected
appearance
with
pleasure
on
entering
however
i
found
the
chamber
as
lonely
as
i
had
left
it
the
light
came
from
a
lamp
that
burned
brightly
on
the
table
beside
it
was
unfolded
the
volume
which
melanius
had
brought
and
upon
the
joy
and
the
cross
of
alethe
what
hand
but
her
own
could
have
prepared
this
reception
for
me
very
thought
sent
a
hope
into
my
heart
before
which
all
despondency
fled
even
the
gloom
of
the
desert
was
forgotten
and
my
cave
at
once
brightened
into
a
bower
she
had
here
reminded
me
herself
by
this
sacred
memorial
of
the
vow
which
i
had
pledged
to
her
under
the
rock
and
i
now
scrupled
not
to
reiterate
the
same
daring
promise
though
conscious
that
through
hypocrisy
alone
i
could
fulfil
it
eager
to
prepare
myself
for
my
task
of
imposture
i
sat
down
to
the
volume
which
i
now
found
to
be
the
hebrew
scriptures
and
the
first
sentence
on
which
my
eyes
fell
lord
hath
commanded
the
blessing
even
life
for
evermore
startled
by
these
words
in
which
the
spirit
of
my
dream
seemed
again
to
pronounce
his
assuring
prediction
i
raised
my
eyes
from
the
page
and
repeated
the
sentence
over
and
over
as
if
to
try
whether
the
sounds
had
any
charm
or
spell
to
reawaken
that
faded
illusion
in
my
soul
but
rank
frauds
of
the
memphian
priesthood
had
dispelled
all
my
trust
in
the
promises
of
religion
my
heart
had
again
relapsed
into
its
gloom
of
scepticism
and
to
the
word
of
the
only
answer
it
sent
back
was
impatient
however
to
possess
myself
of
the
elements
of
a
faith
on
which
it
might
promise
for
hereafter
felt
that
my
happiness
here
depended
i
turned
over
the
pages
with
an
earnestness
and
avidity
such
as
never
even
the
most
favourite
of
my
studies
had
awakened
in
me
though
like
all
who
seek
but
the
surface
of
learning
i
flew
desultorily
over
the
leaves
lighting
only
on
the
more
prominent
and
shining
points
i
yet
found
myself
even
in
this
undisciplined
career
arrested
at
every
page
by
the
awful
the
supernatural
sublimity
the
alternate
melancholy
and
grandeur
of
the
images
that
crowded
upon
me
i
had
till
now
known
the
hebrew
theology
but
through
the
platonising
refinements
of
philo
in
like
manner
for
my
knowledge
of
the
christian
doctrine
i
was
indebted
to
my
brother
epicureans
lucian
and
celsus
little
therefore
was
i
prepared
for
the
simple
majesty
the
high
tone
of
inspiration
poetry
in
short
of
heaven
that
breathed
throughout
these
oracles
could
admiration
have
kindled
faith
i
should
that
night
have
been
a
believer
so
elevated
so
awed
was
my
imagination
by
that
wonderful
book
warnings
of
woe
its
announcements
of
glory
and
its
unrivalled
strains
of
adoration
and
sorrow
hour
after
hour
with
the
same
eager
and
desultory
curiosity
did
i
turn
over
the
leaves
when
at
length
i
lay
down
to
rest
my
fancy
was
still
haunted
by
the
impressions
it
had
received
i
went
again
through
the
various
scenes
of
which
i
had
read
again
called
up
in
sleep
the
bright
images
that
had
charmed
me
and
when
wakened
at
by
the
hymn
from
the
chapel
fancied
myself
still
listening
to
the
sound
of
the
winds
sighing
mournfully
through
the
harps
of
israel
on
the
willows
starting
from
my
bed
i
hurried
out
upon
the
rock
with
a
hope
that
among
the
tones
of
that
morning
choir
i
might
be
able
to
distinguish
the
sweet
voice
of
alethe
but
the
strain
had
ceased
caught
only
the
last
notes
of
the
hymn
as
echoing
up
that
lonely
valley
they
died
away
into
the
silence
of
the
desert
with
the
first
glimpse
of
light
i
was
again
at
my
study
and
notwithstanding
the
distraction
both
of
my
thoughts
and
looks
towards
the
grottos
of
the
anchoret
pursued
it
perseveringly
through
the
day
still
alive
however
but
to
the
eloquence
the
poetry
of
what
i
read
of
its
connection
or
authenticity
as
a
history
i
never
paused
to
consider
my
fancy
being
alone
interested
by
it
to
fancy
i
referred
all
it
contained
and
passing
rapidly
from
annals
to
prophecy
from
narration
to
song
regarded
the
whole
but
as
a
tissue
of
splendid
allegories
in
which
the
melancholy
of
egyptian
associations
was
interwoven
with
the
rich
imagery
of
the
east
towards
sunset
i
saw
the
boat
of
melanius
on
its
way
across
the
canal
to
my
cave
though
he
had
no
other
companion
than
his
graceful
antelope
that
stood
snuffing
the
wild
air
of
the
desert
as
if
scenting
its
home
i
felt
his
visit
even
thus
to
be
a
most
welcome
relief
it
was
the
hour
he
said
of
his
evening
ramble
up
the
mountain
his
accustomed
visit
to
those
cisterns
of
the
rock
from
which
he
nightly
drew
his
most
precious
beverage
while
he
spoke
i
observed
in
his
hand
one
of
those
earthen
cups
in
which
the
inhabitants
of
the
wilderness
are
accustomed
to
collect
the
fresh
dew
among
the
rocks
having
proposed
that
i
should
accompany
him
in
his
walk
he
led
me
in
the
direction
of
the
desert
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
that
rose
above
my
dwelling
and
which
formed
the
southern
wall
or
screen
of
the
defile
near
the
summit
we
found
a
seat
where
the
old
man
paused
to
rest
it
commanded
a
full
view
over
the
desert
and
was
by
the
side
of
one
of
those
hollows
in
the
rock
those
natural
reservoirs
in
which
the
dews
of
night
are
treasured
up
for
the
refreshment
of
the
dwellers
in
the
wilderness
having
learned
from
me
how
far
i
had
proceeded
in
my
study
that
light
said
he
pointing
to
a
small
cloud
in
the
east
which
had
been
formed
on
the
horizon
by
the
haze
of
the
desert
and
was
now
faintly
reflecting
the
splendours
of
sunset
that
light
stands
mount
sinai
of
whose
glory
thou
hast
read
on
whose
summit
was
the
scene
of
one
of
those
awful
revelations
in
which
the
almighty
has
from
time
to
time
renewed
his
communication
with
man
and
kept
alive
the
remembrance
of
his
own
providence
in
this
after
a
pause
as
if
absorbed
in
the
immensity
of
the
subject
the
holy
man
continued
his
sublime
theme
looking
back
to
the
earliest
annals
of
time
he
showed
how
constantly
every
relapse
of
the
human
race
into
idolatry
has
been
followed
by
some
manifestation
of
divine
power
chastening
the
proud
by
punishment
and
winning
back
the
humble
by
love
it
was
to
preserve
he
said
unextinguished
upon
earth
that
vital
truth
creation
of
the
world
by
one
supreme
being
god
chose
from
among
the
nations
an
humble
and
enslaved
race
he
brought
them
out
of
their
captivity
wings
and
surrounding
every
step
of
their
course
with
miracles
placed
them
before
the
eyes
of
all
succeeding
generations
as
the
depositaries
of
his
will
and
the
memorials
of
his
power
passing
then
in
review
the
long
train
of
inspired
interpreters
whose
pens
and
whose
tongues
were
made
the
echoes
of
the
divine
voice
he
traced
through
the
events
of
successive
ages
the
gradual
unfolding
of
the
dark
scheme
of
without
but
all
light
and
glory
within
the
glimpses
of
a
coming
redemption
visible
even
through
the
wrath
of
heaven
long
series
of
prophecy
through
which
this
hope
runs
burning
and
alive
like
a
spark
through
a
chain
merciful
preparation
of
the
hearts
of
mankind
for
the
great
trial
of
their
faith
and
obedience
that
was
at
hand
not
only
by
miracles
that
appealed
to
the
living
but
by
predictions
launched
into
futurity
to
carry
conviction
to
the
yet
unborn
all
these
glorious
and
beneficent
gradations
we
may
track
said
he
manifest
footsteps
of
a
creator
advancing
to
his
grand
ultimate
end
the
salvation
of
his
after
some
hours
devoted
to
these
holy
instructions
we
returned
to
the
ravine
and
melanius
left
me
at
my
cave
praying
as
he
parted
from
me
a
benevolence
i
but
ill
alas
deserved
my
soul
under
these
lessons
might
be
a
watered
garden
and
ere
long
bear
unto
life
next
morning
i
was
again
at
my
study
and
even
more
eager
in
the
task
than
before
with
the
commentary
of
the
hermit
freshly
in
my
memory
i
again
read
through
with
attention
the
book
of
the
law
but
in
vain
did
i
seek
the
promise
of
immortality
in
its
pages
tells
me
said
i
a
god
coming
down
to
earth
but
of
the
ascent
of
man
to
heaven
it
speaks
not
the
rewards
the
punishments
it
announces
lie
all
on
this
side
of
the
grave
nor
did
even
the
omnipotent
offer
to
his
own
chosen
servants
a
hope
beyond
the
impassable
limits
of
this
world
where
then
is
the
salvation
of
which
the
christian
spoke
or
if
death
be
at
the
root
of
the
faith
can
life
spring
out
of
it
again
in
the
bitterness
of
disappointment
did
i
mock
at
my
own
willing
rail
at
the
arts
of
that
traitress
fancy
ever
ready
like
the
delilah
of
this
book
to
steal
upon
the
slumbers
of
reason
and
deliver
him
up
shorn
and
powerless
to
his
foes
if
i
with
a
necessary
at
least
let
me
not
practise
it
on
myself
the
desperate
alternative
before
me
let
me
rather
be
even
hypocrite
than
dupe
these
reflections
cheerless
as
they
rendered
my
task
did
not
abate
for
a
single
moment
my
industry
in
pursuing
it
i
read
on
and
on
with
a
sort
of
sullen
apathy
neither
charmed
by
style
nor
transported
by
imagery
fatal
blight
in
my
heart
having
communicated
itself
to
my
fancy
and
taste
the
curses
and
the
blessings
the
glory
and
the
ruin
which
the
historian
recorded
and
the
prophet
predicted
seemed
all
of
this
world
temporal
and
earthly
that
mortality
of
which
the
had
tasted
tinged
the
whole
stream
and
when
i
read
the
words
are
of
the
dust
and
all
turn
to
dust
again
a
feeling
like
the
wind
of
the
desert
came
witheringly
over
me
love
beauty
glory
every
thing
most
bright
upon
earth
appeared
sinking
before
my
eyes
under
this
dreadful
doom
into
one
general
mass
of
corruption
and
silence
possessed
by
the
image
of
desolation
i
had
called
up
i
laid
my
head
on
the
book
in
a
paroxysm
of
despair
death
in
all
his
most
ghastly
varieties
passed
before
me
and
i
had
continued
thus
for
some
time
as
under
the
influence
of
a
fearful
vision
when
the
touch
of
a
hand
upon
my
shoulder
roused
me
looking
up
i
saw
the
anchoret
standing
by
my
side
countenance
beaming
with
that
sublime
tranquillity
which
a
hope
beyond
this
earth
alone
can
bestow
how
i
envied
him
we
again
took
our
way
to
the
seat
upon
the
mountain
gloom
in
my
own
mind
making
every
thing
around
me
more
gloomy
forgetting
my
hypocrisy
in
my
feelings
i
at
once
avowed
to
him
all
the
doubts
and
fears
which
my
study
of
the
morning
had
awakened
art
yet
my
son
he
answered
on
the
threshold
of
our
faith
thou
hast
seen
but
the
first
rudiments
of
the
divine
plan
full
and
consummate
perfection
hath
not
yet
opened
upon
thee
however
glorious
that
manifestation
of
divinity
on
mount
sinai
it
was
but
the
forerunner
of
another
still
more
glorious
that
in
the
fulness
of
time
was
to
burst
upon
the
world
when
all
that
had
seemed
dim
and
incomplete
was
to
be
perfected
and
the
promises
shadowed
out
by
the
of
prophecy
realized
the
silence
that
lay
as
a
seal
on
the
future
was
to
be
broken
and
the
glad
tidings
of
life
and
immortality
proclaimed
to
the
world
observing
my
features
brighten
at
these
words
the
pious
man
continued
anticipating
some
of
the
holy
knowledge
that
was
in
store
for
me
he
traced
through
all
its
wonders
and
mercies
the
great
work
of
redemption
dwelling
on
every
miraculous
circumstance
connected
with
it
exalted
nature
of
the
being
by
whose
ministry
it
was
accomplished
the
noblest
and
first
created
of
the
sons
of
god
inferior
only
to
the
one
existent
father
mysterious
incarnation
of
this
heavenly
messenger
miracles
that
authenticated
his
divine
mission
example
of
obedience
to
god
and
love
to
man
which
he
set
as
a
shining
light
before
the
world
for
ever
lastly
and
chiefly
his
death
and
resurrection
by
which
the
covenant
of
mercy
was
sealed
and
and
immortality
brought
to
continued
the
hermit
the
mediator
promised
through
all
time
to
reconciliation
for
iniquity
to
change
death
into
life
and
bring
on
his
to
a
darkened
world
such
was
the
last
crowning
dispensation
of
that
god
of
benevolence
in
whose
hands
sin
and
death
are
but
instruments
of
everlasting
good
and
who
through
apparent
evil
and
temporary
retribution
bringing
all
things
of
darkness
into
his
marvellous
light
proceeds
watchfully
and
unchangingly
to
the
great
final
object
of
his
providence
restoration
of
the
whole
human
race
to
purity
and
happiness
with
a
mind
astonished
if
not
touched
by
these
discourses
i
returned
to
my
cave
and
found
the
lamp
as
before
ready
lighted
to
receive
me
the
volume
which
i
had
been
reading
was
replaced
by
another
which
lay
open
upon
the
table
with
a
branch
of
fresh
palm
between
its
leaves
though
i
could
not
have
a
doubt
to
whose
gentle
hand
i
was
indebted
for
this
invisible
superintendence
over
my
studies
there
was
yet
a
something
in
it
so
like
spiritual
interposition
that
it
awed
me
never
more
than
at
this
moment
when
on
approaching
the
volume
i
saw
as
the
light
glistened
over
its
silver
letters
that
it
was
the
very
book
of
life
of
which
the
hermit
had
spoken
the
orison
of
the
christians
had
sounded
through
the
valley
before
i
raised
my
eyes
from
that
sacred
volume
and
the
second
hour
of
the
sun
found
me
again
over
its
pages
chap
xviii
in
this
mode
of
existence
did
i
pass
some
days
mornings
devoted
to
reading
my
nights
to
listening
under
the
canopy
of
heaven
to
the
holy
eloquence
of
melanius
the
perseverance
with
which
i
enquired
and
the
quickness
with
which
i
learned
soon
succeeded
in
deceiving
my
benevolent
instructor
who
mistook
curiosity
for
zeal
and
knowledge
for
belief
alas
cold
and
barren
and
earthly
was
that
knowledge
word
without
the
spirit
the
shape
without
the
life
even
when
as
a
relief
from
hypocrisy
i
persuaded
myself
that
i
believed
it
was
but
a
brief
delusion
a
faith
whose
hope
crumbled
at
the
touch
the
fruit
of
the
shining
and
empty
but
though
my
soul
was
still
dark
the
good
hermit
saw
not
into
its
depths
the
very
facility
of
my
belief
which
might
have
suggested
some
doubt
of
its
sincerity
was
but
regarded
by
his
innocent
zeal
as
a
more
signal
triumph
of
the
truth
his
own
ingenuousness
led
him
to
a
ready
trust
in
others
and
the
examples
of
such
conversion
as
that
of
the
philosopher
justin
who
received
the
light
into
his
soul
during
a
walk
by
the
had
prepared
him
for
illuminations
of
the
spirit
even
more
rapid
than
mine
during
this
time
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
of
alethe
could
my
patience
have
endured
so
long
a
privation
had
not
those
mute
vestiges
of
her
presence
that
welcomed
me
every
night
on
my
return
made
me
feel
that
i
was
still
living
under
her
gentle
influence
and
that
her
sympathy
hung
round
every
step
of
my
progress
once
too
when
i
ventured
to
speak
her
name
to
melanius
though
he
answered
not
my
enquiry
there
was
a
smile
i
thought
of
promise
upon
his
countenance
which
love
more
alive
than
faith
interpreted
as
it
wished
at
length
was
on
the
sixth
or
seventh
evening
of
my
solitude
when
i
lay
resting
at
the
door
of
my
cave
alter
the
study
of
the
day
was
startled
by
hearing
my
name
called
loudly
from
the
opposite
rocks
and
looking
up
saw
on
the
cliff
near
the
deserted
grottos
melanius
i
could
not
alethe
by
his
side
though
i
had
never
ceased
since
the
first
night
of
my
return
from
the
desert
to
flatter
myself
with
the
fancy
that
i
was
still
living
in
her
presence
the
actual
sight
of
her
again
made
me
feel
what
an
age
we
had
been
separated
she
was
clothed
all
in
white
and
as
she
stood
in
the
last
remains
of
the
sunshine
appeared
to
my
too
prophetic
fancy
like
a
parting
spirit
whose
last
footsteps
on
earth
that
glory
encircled
with
a
delight
only
to
be
imagined
i
saw
them
descend
the
rocks
and
placing
themselves
in
the
boat
proceed
towards
my
cave
to
disguise
from
melanius
the
feelings
with
which
we
met
was
impossible
did
alethe
even
attempt
to
make
a
secret
of
her
innocent
joy
though
blushing
at
her
own
happiness
she
could
as
little
conceal
it
as
the
clear
waters
of
ethiopia
can
hide
their
gold
every
look
too
every
word
spoke
a
fulness
of
affection
to
which
doubtful
as
i
was
of
our
tenure
of
happiness
i
knew
not
how
to
answer
i
was
not
long
however
left
ignorant
of
the
bright
fate
that
awaited
me
but
as
we
wandered
or
rested
among
the
rocks
learned
every
thing
that
had
been
arranged
since
our
parting
she
had
made
the
hermit
i
found
acquainted
with
all
that
had
passed
between
us
had
told
him
without
reserve
every
incident
of
our
voyage
avowals
the
demonstrations
of
affection
on
one
side
and
the
deep
sentiment
that
gratitude
had
awakened
on
the
other
too
wise
to
regard
feelings
so
natural
with
severity
that
they
were
of
heaven
and
but
made
evil
by
man
good
hermit
had
heard
of
our
attachment
with
pleasure
and
proved
as
he
thought
the
purity
of
my
views
had
been
by
the
fidelity
with
which
i
had
delivered
up
my
trust
into
his
hands
saw
in
my
affection
for
the
young
orphan
but
a
providential
resource
against
that
friendless
solitude
in
which
his
death
must
soon
leave
her
as
i
collected
these
particulars
from
their
discourse
i
could
hardly
trust
my
ears
it
seemed
too
much
happiness
to
be
real
nor
can
words
give
an
idea
of
the
wonder
with
which
i
listened
while
the
holy
man
himself
declared
that
he
awaited
but
the
moment
when
he
should
find
me
worthy
of
becoming
a
member
of
the
christian
church
to
give
me
also
the
hand
of
alethe
in
that
sacred
union
which
alone
sanctifies
love
and
makes
the
faith
which
it
pledges
heavenly
it
was
but
yesterday
he
added
that
his
young
charge
herself
after
a
preparation
of
prayer
and
repentance
such
as
even
her
pure
spirit
required
had
been
admitted
by
the
sacred
ordinance
of
baptism
into
the
bosom
of
the
faith
the
white
garment
she
wore
and
the
ring
of
gold
on
her
finger
symbols
he
said
that
new
life
into
which
she
had
been
i
raised
my
eyes
to
her
as
he
spoke
but
withdrew
them
again
dazzled
and
confused
even
her
beauty
to
my
imagination
seemed
to
have
undergone
some
brightening
change
and
the
contrast
between
that
open
and
happy
countenance
and
the
unblest
brow
of
the
infidel
that
stood
before
her
abashed
me
into
a
sense
of
unworthiness
and
almost
checked
my
rapture
to
that
night
however
i
look
back
as
an
epoch
in
my
existence
it
proved
that
sorrow
is
not
the
only
awakener
of
devotion
but
that
joy
may
sometimes
call
the
holy
spark
into
life
returning
to
my
cave
with
a
heart
full
even
to
oppression
of
its
happiness
i
knew
no
other
relief
to
my
overcharged
feelings
than
that
of
throwing
myself
on
my
knees
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
uttering
a
prayer
that
if
indeed
there
were
a
being
who
watched
over
mankind
he
would
send
down
one
ray
of
his
truth
into
my
soul
and
make
it
worthy
of
the
blessings
both
here
and
hereafter
proffered
to
me
my
days
now
rolled
on
in
a
perfect
dream
of
happiness
every
hour
of
the
morning
was
welcomed
as
bringing
nearer
and
nearer
the
blest
time
of
sunset
when
the
hermit
and
alethe
never
failed
to
pay
their
visit
to
my
now
charmed
cave
where
her
smile
left
a
light
at
each
parting
that
lasted
till
her
return
then
our
rambles
by
over
the
mountain
pauses
on
the
way
to
contemplate
the
bright
wonders
of
that
heaven
above
us
repose
by
the
cistern
of
the
rock
and
our
silent
listening
through
hours
that
seemed
minutes
to
the
holy
eloquence
of
our
teacher
all
was
happiness
of
the
most
heartfelt
kind
and
such
as
even
the
doubts
the
cold
lingering
doubts
that
still
hung
like
a
mist
around
my
heart
could
neither
cloud
nor
chill
when
the
moonlight
nights
returned
we
used
to
venture
into
the
desert
and
those
sands
which
but
lately
had
appeared
to
me
so
desolate
now
wore
even
a
cheerful
and
smiling
aspect
to
the
light
innocent
heart
of
alethe
every
thing
was
a
source
of
enjoyment
for
her
even
the
desert
had
its
jewels
and
flowers
and
sometimes
her
delight
was
to
search
among
the
sands
for
those
beautiful
pebbles
of
jasper
that
abound
in
them
her
eyes
sparkled
on
finding
perhaps
a
stunted
marigold
or
one
of
those
bitter
scarlet
flowers
that
lend
their
mockery
of
ornament
to
the
desert
in
all
these
pursuits
and
pleasures
the
good
hermit
took
a
share
with
them
occasionally
the
reflections
of
a
benevolent
piety
that
lent
its
own
cheerful
hue
to
all
the
works
of
creation
and
saw
the
consoling
truth
is
love
written
legibly
every
where
such
was
for
a
few
weeks
my
blissful
life
oh
mornings
of
hope
oh
nights
of
happiness
with
what
mournful
pleasure
do
i
retrace
your
flight
and
how
reluctantly
pass
to
the
sad
events
that
followed
during
this
time
in
compliance
with
the
wishes
of
melanius
who
seemed
unwilling
that
i
should
become
wholly
estranged
from
the
world
i
occasionally
paid
a
visit
to
the
neighbouring
city
antinoë
which
as
the
capital
of
the
thebaid
is
the
centre
of
all
the
luxury
of
upper
egypt
here
changed
was
my
every
feeling
by
the
passion
that
possessed
me
wandered
unamused
and
uninterested
by
either
the
scenes
or
the
people
that
surrounded
me
and
sighing
for
that
rocky
solitude
where
alethe
breathed
felt
to
be
the
wilderness
and
the
world
even
the
thoughts
of
my
own
native
athens
that
were
called
up
at
every
step
by
the
light
grecian
architecture
of
this
imperial
city
did
not
awaken
one
single
regret
in
my
wish
to
exchange
even
an
hour
of
my
desert
for
the
best
luxuries
and
honours
that
awaited
me
in
the
garden
i
saw
the
arches
of
triumph
walked
under
the
superb
portico
which
encircles
the
whole
city
with
its
marble
shade
stood
in
the
circus
of
the
sun
by
whose
pillars
the
mysterious
movements
of
the
nile
are
measured
these
bright
ornaments
of
glory
and
art
as
well
as
the
gay
multitude
that
enlivened
them
i
saw
with
an
unheeding
eye
if
they
awakened
in
me
any
thought
it
was
the
mournful
idea
that
one
day
like
thebes
and
heliopolis
this
pageant
would
pass
away
leaving
nothing
behind
but
a
few
mouldering
ruins
the
found
where
the
ocean
has
been
tell
that
the
great
tide
of
life
was
once
there
but
though
indifferent
thus
to
all
that
had
formerly
attracted
me
there
were
subjects
once
alien
to
my
heart
on
which
it
was
now
most
tremblingly
alive
and
some
rumours
which
had
reached
me
in
one
of
my
visits
to
the
city
of
an
expected
change
in
the
policy
of
the
emperor
towards
the
christians
filled
me
with
apprehensions
as
new
as
they
were
dreadful
to
me
the
peace
and
even
favour
which
the
christians
enjoyed
during
the
first
four
years
of
the
reign
of
valerian
had
removed
from
them
all
fear
of
a
renewal
of
those
horrors
which
they
had
experienced
under
the
rule
of
his
predecessor
decius
of
late
however
some
less
friendly
dispositions
had
manifested
themselves
the
bigots
of
the
court
taking
alarm
at
the
spread
of
the
new
faith
had
succeeded
in
filling
the
mind
of
the
monarch
with
that
religious
jealousy
which
is
the
parent
of
cruelty
and
injustice
among
these
counsellors
of
evil
was
macrianus
the
prætorian
prefect
who
was
by
birth
an
egyptian
akin
is
superstition
to
long
made
himself
notorious
by
his
addiction
to
the
dark
practices
of
and
magic
from
this
minister
who
was
now
high
in
the
favour
of
valerian
the
expected
measures
of
severity
against
the
christians
it
was
supposed
would
emanate
all
tongues
in
all
quarters
were
busy
with
the
news
in
the
streets
in
the
public
gardens
on
the
steps
of
the
temples
i
saw
every
where
groups
of
enquirers
collected
and
heard
the
name
of
macrianus
upon
every
tongue
it
was
dreadful
too
to
observe
in
the
countenances
of
those
who
spoke
the
variety
of
feeling
with
which
the
rumour
was
discussed
according
as
they
desired
or
dreaded
its
truth
as
they
were
likely
to
be
among
the
torturers
or
the
victims
alarmed
though
still
ignorant
of
the
whole
extent
of
the
danger
i
hurried
back
to
the
ravine
and
going
at
once
to
the
grotto
of
melanius
detailed
to
him
every
particular
of
the
intelligence
i
had
collected
he
heard
me
with
a
composure
which
i
mistook
alas
for
confidence
in
his
security
and
naming
the
hour
for
our
evening
walk
retired
into
his
grotto
at
the
accustomed
time
alethe
and
he
were
at
my
cave
it
was
evident
that
he
had
not
communicated
to
her
the
intelligence
which
i
had
brought
for
never
did
brow
wear
such
a
happiness
as
that
which
now
played
round
hers
was
alas
of
this
earth
melanius
himself
though
composed
was
thoughtful
and
the
solemnity
almost
approaching
to
melancholy
with
which
he
placed
the
hand
of
alethe
in
the
performance
too
of
a
ceremony
that
to
have
filled
my
heart
with
and
alarmed
me
this
ceremony
was
our
betrothment
plighting
of
our
faith
to
each
other
we
now
solemnized
on
the
rock
before
the
door
of
my
cave
in
the
face
of
that
sunset
heaven
with
its
one
star
standing
as
witness
after
a
blessing
from
the
hermit
on
our
spousal
pledge
i
placed
the
ring
earnest
of
our
future
her
finger
and
in
the
blush
with
which
she
surrendered
her
whole
heart
to
me
at
that
instant
forgot
every
thing
but
my
happiness
and
felt
secure
even
against
fate
we
took
our
accustomed
walk
over
the
rocks
and
on
the
desert
the
moon
was
so
bright
the
daylight
indeed
of
other
we
could
see
plainly
the
tracks
of
the
wild
antelopes
in
the
sand
and
it
was
not
without
a
slight
tremble
of
feeling
in
his
voice
as
if
some
melancholy
analogy
occurred
to
him
as
he
spoke
that
the
good
hermit
said
have
observed
in
my
walks
that
the
track
of
that
gentle
animal
is
seen
there
is
almost
always
the
of
a
beast
of
prey
near
he
regained
however
his
usual
cheerfulness
before
we
parted
and
fixed
the
following
evening
for
an
excursion
on
the
other
side
of
the
ravine
to
a
point
looking
he
said
that
northern
region
of
the
desert
where
the
hosts
of
the
lord
encamped
in
their
departure
out
of
though
in
the
presence
of
alethe
my
fears
even
for
herself
were
forgotten
in
that
perpetual
element
of
happiness
which
encircled
her
like
the
air
that
she
breathed
no
sooner
was
i
alone
than
vague
terrors
and
bodings
crowded
upon
me
in
vain
did
i
try
to
reason
myself
out
of
my
fears
by
dwelling
on
the
most
cheering
circumstances
reverence
with
which
melanius
was
regarded
even
by
the
pagans
and
the
inviolate
security
with
which
he
had
lived
through
the
most
perilous
periods
not
only
safe
himself
but
affording
sanctuary
in
his
grottos
to
others
when
somewhat
calmed
by
these
considerations
i
sunk
off
to
sleep
dark
horrible
dreams
took
possession
of
my
mind
scenes
of
death
and
of
torment
passed
confusedly
before
me
and
when
i
awoke
it
was
with
the
fearful
impression
that
all
these
horrors
were
real
chap
xix
at
length
the
day
dawned
dreadful
day
impatient
to
be
relieved
from
my
suspense
i
threw
myself
into
my
boat
same
in
which
we
had
performed
our
happy
voyage
as
fast
as
oars
could
speed
me
hurried
away
to
the
city
i
found
the
suburbs
silent
and
solitary
but
as
i
approached
the
forum
loud
yells
like
those
of
barbarians
in
combat
struck
on
my
ear
and
when
i
entered
it
god
what
a
spectacle
presented
itself
the
imperial
edict
against
the
christians
had
arrived
during
the
night
and
already
the
wild
fury
of
bigotry
was
let
loose
under
a
canopy
in
the
middle
of
the
forum
was
the
tribunal
of
the
governor
two
statues
one
of
apollo
the
other
of
osiris
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
that
led
up
to
his
before
these
idols
were
shrines
to
which
the
devoted
christians
were
dragged
from
all
quarters
by
the
soldiers
and
mob
and
there
compelled
to
recant
by
throwing
incense
into
the
flame
or
on
their
refusal
hurried
away
to
torture
and
death
it
was
an
appalling
scene
consternation
the
cries
of
some
of
the
victims
pale
silent
resolution
of
others
fierce
shouts
of
laughter
that
broke
from
the
multitude
when
the
frankincense
dropped
on
the
altar
proclaimed
some
denier
of
christ
and
the
triumph
with
which
the
courageous
confessors
who
avowed
their
faith
were
led
away
to
the
flames
could
i
have
conceived
such
an
assemblage
of
horrors
though
i
gazed
but
for
a
few
minutes
in
those
minutes
i
felt
enough
for
years
already
did
the
form
of
alethe
flit
before
me
through
that
tumult
heard
them
shout
her
name
shriek
fell
on
my
ear
and
the
very
thought
so
palsied
me
with
terror
that
i
stood
fixed
and
on
the
spot
recollecting
however
the
fearful
preciousness
of
every
moment
and
at
this
very
emissaries
of
blood
might
be
on
their
way
to
the
grottos
i
rushed
wildly
out
of
the
forum
and
made
my
way
to
the
quay
the
streets
were
now
crowded
but
i
ran
headlong
through
the
multitude
and
was
already
under
the
portico
leading
down
to
the
river
saw
the
boat
that
was
to
bear
me
to
alethe
a
centurion
stood
sternly
in
my
path
and
i
was
surrounded
and
arrested
by
soldiers
it
was
in
vain
that
i
implored
that
i
struggled
with
them
as
for
life
assuring
them
that
i
was
a
stranger
i
was
an
athenian
i
a
christian
the
precipitation
of
my
flight
was
sufficient
evidence
against
me
and
unrelentingly
and
by
force
they
bore
me
away
to
the
quarters
of
their
chief
it
was
enough
to
drive
me
to
madness
two
hours
two
frightful
hours
was
i
kept
waiting
the
arrival
of
the
tribune
of
their
legion
brain
burning
with
a
thousand
fears
and
imaginations
which
every
passing
minute
made
more
likely
to
be
realised
every
thing
too
that
i
could
collect
from
the
conversations
around
me
but
added
to
the
agonising
apprehensions
with
which
i
was
racked
troops
it
was
said
had
been
sent
in
all
directions
through
the
neighbourhood
to
bring
in
the
rebellious
christians
and
make
them
bow
before
the
gods
of
the
empire
with
horror
too
i
heard
of
orcus
the
high
priest
of
memphis
one
of
the
principal
instigators
of
this
sanguinary
edict
and
as
here
present
in
antinoë
animating
and
directing
its
execution
in
this
state
of
torture
i
remained
till
the
arrival
of
the
tribune
absorbed
in
my
own
thoughts
i
had
not
perceived
his
entrance
hearing
a
voice
in
a
tone
of
friendly
surprise
exclaim
i
looked
up
and
in
this
legionary
chief
recognised
a
young
roman
of
rank
who
had
held
a
military
command
the
year
before
at
athens
and
was
one
of
the
most
distinguished
visitors
of
the
garden
it
was
no
time
however
for
courtesies
was
proceeding
with
cordiality
to
greet
me
but
having
heard
him
order
my
instant
release
i
could
wait
for
no
more
acknowledging
his
kindness
but
by
a
grasp
of
the
hand
i
flew
off
like
one
frantic
through
the
streets
and
in
a
few
minutes
was
on
the
river
my
sole
hope
had
been
to
reach
the
grottos
before
any
of
the
detached
parties
should
arrive
and
by
a
timely
flight
across
the
desert
rescue
at
least
alethe
from
their
fury
the
delay
that
had
occurred
rendered
this
hope
almost
desperate
but
the
tranquillity
i
found
every
where
as
i
proceeded
down
the
river
and
the
fond
confidence
i
still
cherished
in
the
sacredness
of
the
retreat
kept
my
heart
from
giving
way
altogether
under
its
terrors
between
the
current
and
my
oars
the
boat
flew
like
wind
along
the
waters
and
i
was
already
near
the
rocks
of
the
ravine
when
i
saw
turning
out
of
the
canal
into
the
river
a
barge
crowded
with
people
and
glittering
with
arms
how
did
i
ever
survive
the
shock
of
that
sight
the
oars
dropped
as
if
struck
out
of
my
hands
into
the
water
and
i
sat
helplessly
gazing
as
that
terrific
vision
approached
in
a
few
minutes
the
current
brought
us
together
i
saw
on
the
deck
of
the
barge
alethe
and
the
hermit
surrounded
by
soldiers
we
were
already
passing
each
other
when
with
a
desperate
effort
i
sprang
from
my
boat
and
lighted
upon
the
edge
of
their
vessel
i
knew
not
what
i
did
for
despair
was
my
only
prompter
snatching
at
the
sword
of
one
of
the
soldiers
as
i
stood
tottering
on
the
edge
i
had
succeeded
in
wresting
it
out
of
his
hands
when
at
the
same
moment
i
received
a
thrust
of
a
lance
from
one
of
his
comrades
and
fell
backward
into
the
river
i
can
just
remember
rising
again
and
making
a
grasp
at
the
side
of
the
vessel
the
shock
the
faintness
from
my
wound
deprived
me
of
all
consciousness
and
a
shriek
from
alethe
as
i
sunk
is
all
i
can
recollect
of
what
followed
would
i
had
then
died
no
almighty
being
should
have
died
in
darkness
and
i
have
lived
to
know
thee
on
returning
to
my
senses
i
found
myself
reclined
on
a
couch
in
a
splendid
apartment
the
whole
appearance
of
which
being
grecian
i
for
a
moment
forgot
all
that
had
passed
and
imagined
myself
in
my
own
home
at
athens
but
too
soon
the
whole
dreadful
certainty
flashed
upon
me
and
starting
as
i
my
couch
i
called
loudly
and
with
the
shriek
of
a
maniac
on
alethe
i
was
in
the
house
i
found
of
my
friend
and
disciple
the
young
tribune
who
had
made
the
governor
acquainted
with
my
name
and
condition
and
had
received
me
under
his
roof
when
brought
bleeding
and
insensible
to
antinoë
from
him
i
now
learned
at
once
i
could
not
wait
for
details
sum
of
all
that
had
happened
in
that
dreadful
interval
melanius
was
no
more
still
alive
but
in
prison
me
to
had
but
time
to
me
to
her
instantly
and
let
me
die
by
her
side
nature
again
failing
under
such
shocks
i
relapsed
into
insensibility
in
this
state
i
continued
for
near
an
hour
and
on
recovering
found
the
tribune
by
my
side
the
horrors
he
said
of
the
forum
were
for
that
day
over
what
the
morrow
might
bring
he
shuddered
to
contemplate
his
nature
it
was
plain
revolted
from
the
inhuman
duties
in
which
he
was
engaged
touched
by
the
agonies
he
saw
me
suffer
he
in
some
degree
relieved
them
by
promising
that
i
should
at
be
conveyed
to
the
prison
and
if
possible
through
his
influence
gain
access
to
alethe
she
might
yet
he
added
be
saved
could
i
succeed
in
persuading
her
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
edict
and
make
sacrifice
to
the
said
he
is
no
hope
vindictive
orcus
who
has
resisted
even
this
short
respite
of
mercy
will
inexorably
demand
his
he
then
related
to
me
at
my
own
request
every
word
was
torture
the
harrowing
details
of
the
proceeding
before
the
tribunal
have
seen
courage
said
he
its
noblest
forms
in
the
field
but
the
calm
intrepidity
with
which
that
aged
hermit
endured
it
was
hardly
less
torment
to
all
that
i
could
have
conceived
of
human
fortitude
my
poor
alethe
too
describing
to
me
her
conduct
the
brave
man
wept
like
a
child
overwhelmed
he
said
at
first
by
her
apprehensions
for
my
safety
she
had
given
way
to
a
full
burst
of
womanly
weakness
but
no
sooner
was
she
brought
before
the
tribunal
and
the
declaration
of
her
faith
was
demanded
of
her
than
a
spirit
almost
supernatural
seemed
to
animate
her
whole
form
raised
her
eyes
said
he
but
with
fervour
to
heaven
while
a
blush
was
the
only
sign
of
mortal
feeling
on
her
features
the
clear
sweet
and
untrembling
voice
with
which
she
pronounced
her
dooming
words
am
a
christian
sent
a
thrill
of
admiration
and
pity
throughout
the
multitude
her
youth
her
loveliness
affected
all
hearts
and
a
cry
of
the
young
maiden
was
heard
in
all
the
implacable
orcus
however
would
not
hear
of
mercy
resenting
as
it
appeared
with
all
his
deadliest
rancour
not
only
her
own
escape
from
his
toils
but
the
aid
with
which
so
fatally
to
his
views
she
had
assisted
mine
he
demanded
loudly
and
in
the
name
of
the
insulted
sanctuary
of
isis
her
instant
death
it
was
but
by
the
firm
intervention
of
the
governor
who
shared
the
general
sympathy
in
her
fate
that
the
delay
of
another
day
was
accorded
to
give
a
chance
to
the
young
maiden
of
yet
recalling
her
confession
and
thus
affording
some
pretext
for
saving
her
even
in
yielding
reluctantly
to
this
brief
respite
the
inhuman
priest
would
accompany
it
with
some
mark
of
his
vengeance
whether
for
the
pleasure
observed
the
tribune
of
mingling
mockery
with
his
cruelty
or
as
a
warning
to
her
of
the
doom
she
must
ultimately
expect
he
gave
orders
that
there
should
be
tied
round
her
brow
one
of
those
chaplets
of
coral
with
which
it
is
the
custom
of
young
christian
maidens
to
array
themselves
on
the
day
of
their
martyrdom
thus
fearfully
adorned
said
he
was
led
away
amid
the
gaze
of
the
pitying
multitude
to
with
these
details
the
short
interval
till
minute
of
which
seemed
an
age
occupied
as
soon
as
it
grew
dark
i
was
placed
upon
a
litter
wound
though
not
dangerous
requiring
such
a
conveyance
conducted
under
the
guidance
of
my
friend
to
the
prison
through
his
interest
with
the
guard
we
were
without
difficulty
admitted
and
i
was
borne
into
the
chamber
where
the
maiden
lay
immured
even
the
veteran
guardian
of
the
place
seemed
touched
with
compassion
for
his
prisoner
and
supposing
her
to
be
asleep
had
the
litter
placed
gently
near
her
she
was
half
reclining
with
her
face
hid
in
her
hands
upon
a
couch
the
foot
of
which
stood
an
idol
over
whose
hideous
features
a
lamp
of
naptha
hanging
from
the
ceiling
shed
a
wild
and
ghastly
glare
on
a
table
before
the
image
stood
a
censer
with
a
small
vessel
of
incense
beside
it
grain
of
which
thrown
voluntarily
into
the
flame
would
even
now
save
that
precious
life
so
strange
so
fearful
was
the
whole
scene
that
i
almost
doubted
its
reality
alethe
my
own
happy
alethe
it
i
thought
be
thou
that
i
look
upon
she
now
slowly
and
with
difficulty
raised
her
head
from
the
couch
on
observing
which
the
kind
tribune
withdrew
and
we
were
left
alone
there
was
a
paleness
as
of
death
over
her
features
and
those
eyes
which
when
last
i
saw
them
were
but
too
bright
too
happy
for
this
world
looked
dim
and
sunken
in
raising
herself
up
she
put
her
hand
as
if
from
pain
to
her
forehead
whose
marble
hue
but
appeared
more
from
those
red
bands
that
lay
so
awfully
across
it
after
wandering
vaguely
for
a
minute
her
eyes
rested
upon
me
with
a
shriek
half
terror
half
joy
she
sprung
from
the
couch
and
sunk
upon
her
knees
by
my
side
she
had
believed
me
dead
and
even
now
scarcely
trusted
her
senses
husband
my
love
she
exclaimed
if
thou
comest
to
call
me
from
this
world
behold
i
am
ready
in
saying
thus
she
pointed
wildly
to
that
ominous
wreath
and
then
dropped
her
head
down
upon
my
knee
as
if
an
arrow
had
pierced
it
cried
terrified
to
the
very
soul
by
that
mysterious
pang
the
sound
of
my
voice
seemed
to
reanimate
her
looked
up
with
a
faint
smile
in
my
face
her
thoughts
which
had
evidently
been
wandering
became
collected
and
in
her
joy
at
my
safety
her
sorrow
at
my
suffering
she
forgot
wholly
the
fate
that
impended
over
herself
love
innocent
love
alone
occupied
all
her
thoughts
and
the
tenderness
with
which
she
spoke
at
any
other
moment
how
i
would
have
listened
have
lingered
upon
have
blessed
every
word
but
the
time
flew
dreadful
morrow
was
approaching
already
i
saw
her
writhing
in
the
hands
of
the
torturer
flames
the
racks
the
wheels
were
before
my
eyes
half
frantic
with
the
fear
that
her
resolution
was
fixed
i
flung
myself
from
the
litter
in
an
agony
of
weeping
and
supplicated
her
by
the
love
she
bore
me
by
the
happiness
that
awaited
us
by
her
own
merciful
god
who
was
too
good
to
require
such
a
sacrifice
all
that
the
most
passionate
anxiety
could
dictate
i
implored
that
she
would
avert
from
us
the
doom
that
was
coming
for
with
the
vain
ceremony
demanded
of
her
shrinking
from
me
as
i
spoke
with
a
look
more
of
sorrow
than
reproach
thou
too
she
said
mournfully
into
whose
spirit
i
had
fondly
hoped
the
same
heavenly
truth
had
descended
as
into
my
own
oh
be
not
thou
leagued
with
those
who
would
tempt
me
to
shipwreck
of
my
faith
thou
who
couldst
alone
bind
me
to
life
use
not
thy
power
but
let
me
die
as
he
i
serve
hath
commanded
for
the
truth
remember
the
holy
lessons
we
heard
on
those
nights
those
happy
nights
when
both
the
present
and
future
smiled
upon
us
even
the
gift
of
eternal
life
came
more
welcome
to
my
soul
from
the
blessed
conviction
that
thou
wert
to
be
a
sharer
in
it
i
forfeit
now
that
divine
privilege
shall
i
deny
the
true
god
whom
we
then
learned
to
love
my
own
betrothed
she
continued
to
the
two
rings
on
her
finger
these
pledges
are
both
sacred
i
should
have
been
as
true
to
thee
as
i
am
now
to
heaven
in
that
life
to
which
i
am
hastening
shall
our
love
be
forgotten
should
the
baptism
of
fire
through
which
i
shall
pass
make
me
worthy
to
be
heard
before
the
throne
of
grace
i
will
intercede
for
thy
will
pray
that
it
may
yet
share
with
mine
that
immortal
and
undefiled
which
mercy
offers
and
that
thou
dear
mother
she
here
dropped
her
voice
the
momentary
animation
with
which
devotion
and
affection
had
inspired
her
vanished
a
darkness
overspread
all
her
features
a
livid
darkness
the
coming
of
made
me
shudder
through
every
limb
seizing
my
hand
convulsively
and
looking
at
me
with
a
fearful
eagerness
as
if
anxious
to
hear
some
consoling
assurance
from
my
own
lips
me
she
continued
all
the
torments
they
are
preparing
for
me
even
this
deep
burning
pain
in
my
brow
which
they
will
hardly
equal
be
half
so
dreadful
to
me
as
the
thought
that
i
leave
here
her
voice
again
failed
her
head
sunk
upon
my
arm

let
me
forget
what
i
then
felt
saw
that
she
was
dying
whether
i
uttered
any
cry

know
not
the
tribune
came
rushing
into
the
chamber
and
looking
on
the
maiden
said
with
a
face
full
of
horror
is
but
too
true
he
then
told
me
in
a
low
voice
what
he
had
just
learned
from
the
guardian
of
the
prison
that
the
band
round
the
young
brow
horrible
cruelty

most
deadly
poison
hellish
invention
of
orcus
to
satiate
his
vengeance
and
make
the
fate
of
his
poor
victim
secure
my
first
movement
was
to
untie
that
fatal
wreath
it
would
not
come
would
not
come
away
roused
by
the
pain
she
again
looked
in
my
face
but
unable
to
speak
took
hastily
from
her
bosom
the
small
silver
cross
which
she
had
brought
with
her
from
my
cave
having
prest
it
to
her
own
lips
she
held
it
anxiously
to
mine
and
seeing
me
kiss
the
holy
symbol
with
fervour
looked
happy
and
smiled
the
agony
of
death
seemed
to
have
passed
away
came
suddenly
over
her
features
a
heavenly
light
some
share
of
which
i
felt
descending
into
my
own
soul
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
she
expired

egyptian

philosopher
converted
to
christianity
by
a
young
egyptian
maiden
who
suffered
martyrdom
in
that
year

upon

death
he
betook
himself
to
the
desert
and
lived
a
life
it
is
said
of
much
holiness
and
penitence
during
the
persecution
under
dioclesian
his
sufferings
for
the
faith
were
most
exemplary
and
being
at
length
at
an
advanced
age
condemned
to
hard
labour
for
refusing
to
comply
with

imperial
edict

opinions
maintained

charges
accuse
him
of
having

for
this
calumny
however
there
appears
to
be
no
better
foundation
than
a
circumstance
recorded
by
one
of

that

way
of
treating

by
either
endeavouring

noblest

opinion
of

be
supposed
to
have

from

it
is
not
easy
to
ascertain

exact
doctrine

of
the
authorities

what
priestley
says
is
perhaps
the
best
solution
of
these
inconsistencies
as
well
as
clemens
alexandrinus
has
been
thought
to
favour
the
arian
principle
but
he
did
it
only
in
words

not
in
whatever
uncertainty
however
there
may
exist
with
respect
to
the
opinion
of
origen
himself
on
this
subject
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
doctrines
of
his
immediate
followers
were
at
least
many
bishops
of
africa
says
priestley
at
this
period
between
the
years
and
unitarians

says
son
of

scarcely
any

physical
evil

which
would
if
received

modern

from

preached
before
the
queen
paley

supposed
to
have
held
the

amiable
doctrine
