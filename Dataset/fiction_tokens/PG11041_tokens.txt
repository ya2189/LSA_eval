the
boy
in
the
straw
hat
how
craps
country
shut
up
bart
he
may
hear
you
what
if
he
does
ninny
i
want
him
to
say
spinach
do
you
suppose
he
going
to
try
and
play
football
bart
not
he
he
looking
for
a
rake
thinks
this
is
a
hayfield
wall
the
speakers
were
lying
on
the
turf
back
of
the
north
goal
on
the
campus
at
hillton
academy
the
elder
and
larger
of
the
two
was
a
rather
youth
of
seventeen
his
name
was
bartlett
cloud
shortened
by
his
acquaintances
to
bart
for
the
sake
of
that
brevity
beloved
of
the
schoolboy
his
companion
wallace
clausen
was
a
handsome
though
rather
boy
a
year
his
junior
the
two
were
roommates
and
friends
he
better
rake
his
hair
responded
the
latter
youth
jeeringly
bet
there
lots
of
hayseed
in
it
the
subject
of
their
derisive
remarks
although
standing
but
a
scant
distance
away
apparently
heard
none
of
them
hi
west
shouted
bartlett
cloud
as
a
youth
attired
in
a
finely
fitting
golf
costume
and
swinging
a
brassie
approached
the
newcomer
hesitated
then
joined
the
two
friends
hello
you
fellows
what
up
thought
it
was
golf
from
the
crowd
over
here
he
stretched
himself
beside
them
on
the
grass
golf
answered
bartlett
cloud
contemptuously
i
do
believe
you
ever
think
of
anything
except
golf
out
do
you
ever
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
trying
to
drive
the
pillow
out
of
the
window
with
a
oh
sometimes
answered
outfield
west
smilingly
there
a
heap
more
sense
in
being
daft
over
a
decent
game
like
golf
than
in
going
crazy
about
football
it
just
a
kid
game
oh
is
it
growled
bartlett
cloud
i
just
like
to
have
you
opposite
me
in
a
good
stiff
game
for
about
five
minutes
i
show
you
something
about
the
game
well
i
do
say
you
could
knock
me
down
a
few
times
and
walk
over
me
but
who
wants
to
play
such
games
except
a
lot
of
bullies
like
yourself
plenty
of
fellows
apparently
answered
the
third
member
of
the
group
wallace
clausen
hastening
to
avert
the
threatening
quarrel
just
look
around
you
i
never
seen
more
fellows
turn
out
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
than
are
here
there
must
be
sixty
here
more
like
a
hundred
grunted
bart
cloud
not
yet
won
over
to
good
temper
every
little
freshman
thinks
he
can
buy
a
pair
of
moleskins
and
be
a
football
man
look
at
that
fellow
over
yonder
the
one
with
the
baggy
trousers
and
straw
hat
the
idea
of
that
fellow
coming
down
here
just
out
of
the
hayfield
and
having
the
cheek
to
report
for
football
practice
what
do
you
suppose
he
would
do
if
some
one
threw
a
ball
at
him
catch
it
in
his
hat
suggested
wallace
clausen
he
look
a
bit
er
rural
said
outfield
west
eying
the
youth
in
question
i
fear
he
does
know
a
bulger
from
a
baffy
he
added
sorrowfully
what
more
to
the
subject
said
wallace
clausen
is
that
he
probably
does
know
a
from
a
referee
there
where
the
fun
will
come
in
well
i
no
judge
of
football
thank
goodness
answered
west
but
from
the
length
of
that
chap
i
bet
he
a
bully
kicker
nonsense
that
what
a
fellow
always
thinks
who
does
know
anything
about
the
game
it
takes
something
more
than
long
legs
to
make
a
good
punter
perhaps
but
there
one
thing
sure
bart
that
hayseed
will
be
a
better
player
than
you
at
the
end
of
two
months
that
is
if
he
gets
taken
on
i
bet
you
he
wo
be
able
to
catch
a
punt
growled
cloud
a
fool
like
him
can
no
more
learn
football
than
than
than
you
could
learn
golf
continued
west
sweetly
oh
shut
up
i
know
a
mule
that
plays
golf
better
than
you
do
well
i
attempt
to
compete
with
your
friends
bart
there
you
both
go
quarreling
again
cried
clausen
if
you
do
shut
up
i
have
to
whip
the
pair
of
you
wallace
clausen
was
about
two
thirds
the
size
of
cloud
and
lacked
both
the
height
and
breadth
of
shoulder
that
made
west
popular
nickname
of
out
west
seem
so
appropriate
clausen
threat
was
so
absurd
that
cloud
came
back
to
good
humor
with
a
laugh
and
even
west
grinned
come
on
wall
there
blair
said
cloud
you
better
come
too
out
and
learn
something
about
a
decent
game
west
shook
his
head
and
the
other
two
arose
and
hurried
away
to
where
the
captain
of
the
school
eleven
was
standing
beneath
the
west
goal
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
variously
attired
football
aspirants
west
left
to
himself
sighed
lazily
and
fell
to
digging
holes
in
the
turf
with
his
brassie
tiring
of
this
amusement
in
a
trice
he
arose
and
sauntered
over
to
the
and
watched
the
operations
some
sixty
boys
varying
in
age
from
fifteen
to
nineteen
some
clothed
in
full
football
rig
some
wearing
the
ordinary
dress
in
which
they
had
stepped
from
the
school
rooms
an
hour
before
all
laughing
or
talking
with
the
high
spirits
produced
upon
healthy
youth
by
the
tonic
breezes
of
late
september
were
standing
about
the
gridiron
i
have
said
that
all
were
laughing
or
talking
this
is
not
true
one
among
them
was
silent
for
standing
near
by
was
the
youth
who
had
aroused
the
merriment
of
cloud
and
clausen
and
who
west
had
shortly
before
dubbed
rural
and
rural
he
looked
his
gray
and
rather
wrinkled
trousers
and
his
black
coat
and
vest
of
cheap
goods
were
in
the
cut
of
two
seasons
gone
and
his
discolored
straw
hat
looked
sadly
out
of
place
among
so
many
warm
caps
but
as
he
watched
the
scene
with
intent
and
earnest
face
there
was
that
about
him
that
held
west
attention
he
looked
to
be
about
seventeen
his
height
was
above
the
ordinary
and
in
the
broad
shoulders
and
hips
lay
promise
of
great
strength
and
vigor
but
it
was
the
face
that
attracted
west
most
so
earnest
honest
and
fearless
was
it
that
west
unconsciously
wished
to
know
it
better
and
found
himself
drawing
nearer
to
the
straw
hat
and
baggy
gray
trousers
but
their
owner
appeared
to
be
unconscious
of
his
presence
and
west
paused
i
do
believe
that
chap
knows
golf
from
mused
west
but
i
bet
a
dozen
silvertowns
that
he
could
learn
and
more
than
most
chaps
here
can
i
almost
believe
that
i
loan
him
my
new
dogwood
driver
wesley
blair
captain
of
the
eleven
was
bringing
order
out
of
chaos
blair
was
one
of
the
leaders
in
school
life
at
hillton
a
strongly
built
manly
fellow
beloved
of
the
higher
class
boys
adored
from
a
distance
by
the
youngsters
blair
was
serving
his
second
term
as
football
captain
having
been
elected
to
succeed
himself
the
previous
fall
at
this
moment
attired
in
the
crimson
sweater
moleskin
trousers
and
black
and
crimson
stockings
that
made
up
the
school
uniform
he
looked
every
inch
the
commander
of
the
motley
array
that
surrounded
him
warren
you
take
a
dozen
or
so
of
these
fellows
over
there
out
of
the
way
and
pass
the
ball
awhile
get
their
names
christie
you
take
another
dozen
farther
down
the
field
the
crowd
began
to
melt
away
squad
after
squad
moving
off
down
the
field
to
take
position
and
learn
the
rudiments
of
the
game
blair
assembled
the
experienced
players
about
him
and
dividing
them
into
two
groups
put
them
to
work
at
passing
and
falling
the
youth
with
the
straw
hat
still
stood
unnoticed
on
the
when
the
last
of
the
squads
had
moved
away
he
stepped
forward
and
addressed
the
captain
where
do
you
want
me
blair
suppressing
a
smile
of
amusement
as
he
looked
the
applicant
over
asked
ever
played
any
some
i
was
right
end
on
the
felton
grammar
school
team
last
year
where
felton
grammar
school
please
maine
near
auburn
oh
what
your
name
joel
march
can
you
kick
pretty
fair
well
show
me
what
you
consider
pretty
fair
he
turned
to
the
nearest
squad
toss
me
the
ball
a
minute
ned
here
a
chap
who
wants
to
try
a
kick
ned
post
threw
the
ball
and
his
squad
of
veterans
turned
to
observe
the
country
boy
toe
the
pigskin
several
audible
remarks
were
made
none
of
them
at
all
flattering
to
the
subject
of
them
but
if
the
latter
heard
them
he
made
no
sign
but
accepted
the
ball
from
blair
without
fumbling
it
much
to
the
surprise
of
the
onlookers
among
these
were
clausen
and
cloud
their
mouths
prepared
for
the
burst
of
ironical
laughter
that
was
expected
to
follow
the
country
boy
effort
drop
or
punt
asked
the
latter
as
he
settled
the
oval
in
a
rather
ample
hand
which
can
you
kick
best
questioned
blair
the
youth
considered
a
moment
i
guess
i
can
punt
best
he
stepped
back
balancing
the
ball
in
his
right
hand
took
a
long
stride
forward
swung
his
right
leg
in
a
wide
arc
dropped
the
ball
and
sent
it
sailing
down
the
field
toward
the
distant
goal
a
murmur
of
applause
took
the
place
of
the
derisive
laugh
and
blair
glanced
curiously
at
the
former
right
of
the
felton
grammar
school
yes
that
pretty
fair
some
day
with
hard
practice
you
may
make
a
kicker
several
of
the
older
fellows
smiled
knowingly
it
was
way
of
nipping
conceit
in
the
bud
what
class
are
you
in
upper
middle
replied
the
youth
under
the
straw
hat
displaying
no
disappointment
at
the
scant
praise
well
march
kindly
go
down
the
field
to
that
last
squad
and
tell
tom
warren
that
i
sent
you
and
say
he
continued
as
the
candidate
started
off
and
he
was
struck
anew
with
the
oddity
of
the
straw
hat
and
wrinkled
trousers
you
had
better
tell
him
that
you
are
the
man
that
punted
that
ball
that
chap
has
got
to
learn
golf
said
outfield
west
to
himself
as
he
turned
away
after
witnessing
the
incident
even
if
i
have
to
him
and
teach
it
to
him
what
did
he
say
his
name
was
february
march
that
was
it
it
kind
of
a
chilly
name
i
make
it
a
point
to
scrape
acquaintance
with
him
he
a
born
golfer
his
calm
indifference
when
blair
tried
to
him
down
was
beautiful
to
see
he
the
sort
of
fellow
that
would
smile
if
he
made
a
foozle
in
a
medal
play
west
drew
a
golf
ball
from
his
pocket
and
throwing
it
on
the
turf
gave
it
a
off
toward
the
river
following
leisurely
after
it
and
pondering
on
the
possibility
of
making
a
crack
golfer
out
of
a
country
lad
in
a
straw
hat
over
on
the
gridiron
meanwhile
the
candidates
for
football
honors
were
limbering
up
in
a
way
that
greatly
surprised
not
a
few
of
the
inexperienced
it
is
one
thing
to
watch
the
game
from
the
grand
stand
or
and
another
to
have
an
awkward
wobbly
elusive
spheroid
tossed
to
the
ground
a
few
feet
from
you
and
be
required
to
straightway
throw
yourself
upon
it
in
such
manner
that
when
it
stops
rolling
it
will
be
snugly
stowed
between
you
and
the
ground
if
the
reader
has
played
football
he
will
know
what
this
means
if
he
has
not
well
there
is
no
use
trying
to
explain
it
to
him
he
must
get
a
ball
and
try
it
for
himself
but
even
this
exercise
may
lose
its
terrors
after
a
while
and
when
at
the
end
of
an
hour
or
more
the
lads
were
dismissed
there
were
many
among
them
who
limped
back
to
their
rooms
sore
and
bruised
but
proudly
elated
over
their
first
day
with
the
pigskin
even
to
the
youth
in
the
straw
hat
it
was
tiresome
work
although
not
new
to
him
and
after
practice
was
over
instead
of
joining
in
the
little
stream
that
eddied
back
to
the
academy
grounds
he
struck
off
to
where
a
long
straggling
row
of
cedars
and
firs
marked
the
course
of
the
river
once
there
he
found
himself
standing
on
a
bluff
with
the
broad
placid
stream
stretching
away
to
the
north
and
south
at
his
feet
the
bank
was
some
twenty
feet
high
and
covered
sparsely
with
grass
and
weeds
and
a
few
feet
below
him
a
granite
bowlder
stuck
its
lichened
head
outward
from
the
cliff
forming
an
inviting
seat
from
which
to
view
the
sunset
across
the
lowland
opposite
the
boy
half
scrambled
half
fell
the
short
distance
and
settling
himself
in
comfort
on
the
ledge
became
at
once
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
perhaps
he
was
thinking
a
trifle
sadly
of
the
home
which
he
had
left
back
there
among
the
maine
hills
and
which
must
have
seemed
a
very
long
way
off
or
perhaps
he
was
dwelling
in
awe
upon
the
erudition
of
that
excellent
greek
gentleman
xenophon
whose
acquaintance
by
means
of
the
anabasis
he
was
just
making
or
perhaps
he
was
thinking
of
no
more
serious
a
subject
than
football
and
the
intricate
art
of
punting
but
whatever
his
thoughts
may
have
been
they
were
doomed
to
speedy
interruption
as
will
be
seen
outfield
west
left
the
campus
behind
and
with
the
little
white
ball
soaring
ahead
took
his
way
leisurely
to
the
woods
that
bordered
the
tiny
lake
here
he
spent
a
quarter
of
an
hour
amid
the
tall
grass
and
bushes
fighting
his
way
patiently
out
of
awkward
lies
and
finally
driving
off
by
the
river
bank
where
a
stretch
of
close
hard
sod
offered
excellent
chances
for
long
shots
again
and
again
the
ball
flew
singing
on
its
way
till
at
last
the
campus
was
at
hand
again
and
stony
bunker
intervened
between
west
and
home
stony
bunker
lay
close
to
the
river
bluff
and
was
the
terror
of
all
hillton
golfers
for
while
a
too
short
stroke
was
likely
to
leave
you
in
the
sand
pit
a
too
vigorous
one
was
just
as
likely
to
land
you
in
the
river
west
knew
stony
bunker
well
by
reason
of
former
meetings
and
he
knew
equally
well
what
amount
of
swing
was
necessary
to
land
just
over
the
hazard
but
well
short
of
the
bluff
perhaps
it
was
the
brassie
that
was
to
blame
for
a
wooden
driver
would
have
been
what
you
or
i
would
have
chosen
for
that
stroke
or
perhaps
west
himself
was
to
blame
that
as
it
may
be
the
fact
remains
that
that
provoking
ball
flew
clear
over
the
bunker
as
though
possessed
of
wings
and
disappeared
over
the
bluff
with
an
exclamation
of
disgust
west
hurried
after
for
when
they
cost
cents
apiece
golf
balls
are
not
willingly
lost
even
by
lads
who
like
outfield
west
possess
allowances
far
in
excess
of
their
needs
but
the
first
glance
down
the
bank
reassured
him
for
there
was
the
runaway
ball
snugly
ensconced
on
the
tiny
strip
of
sandy
beach
that
intervened
between
the
bank
and
the
water
west
grasped
an
overhanging
fir
branch
and
swung
himself
over
the
ledge
now
that
particular
branch
was
no
longer
youthful
and
strong
and
consequently
when
it
felt
the
full
weight
of
west
one
hundred
and
pounds
it
simply
broke
in
his
hand
and
the
boy
started
down
the
steep
slope
with
a
rapidity
that
rather
unnerved
him
and
brought
an
involuntary
cry
of
alarm
to
his
lips
it
was
the
cry
that
was
the
means
of
saving
him
from
painful
results
since
at
the
bottom
of
the
bank
lay
a
bed
of
rocks
that
would
have
caused
many
an
ugly
bruise
had
he
fallen
among
them
but
suddenly
as
he
went
falling
slipping
clutching
wildly
at
the
elusive
weeds
he
was
brought
up
with
a
suddenness
that
drove
the
breath
from
his
body
weak
and
panting
he
struggled
up
to
the
top
of
the
jutting
ledge
assisted
by
two
strong
arms
and
throwing
himself
upon
it
looked
wonderingly
around
for
his
rescuer
above
him
towered
the
boy
in
the
straw
hat
chapter

path
traveling
north
by
rail
up
the
hudson
valley
you
will
come
when
some
two
hours
from
new
york
to
a
little
stone
depot
nestling
at
the
shoulder
of
a
high
wooded
hill
to
reach
it
the
train
suddenly
leaves
the
river
a
mile
back
scurries
across
a
level
meadow
shrills
a
long
blast
on
the
whistle
and
pauses
for
an
instant
at
hillton
if
your
seat
chances
to
be
on
the
left
side
of
the
car
and
if
you
look
quickly
just
as
the
whistle
sounds
you
will
see
in
the
foreground
a
broad
field
running
away
to
the
river
and
in
it
an
oval
track
a
gayly
colored
grand
stand
and
just
beyond
at
some
distance
from
each
other
what
appear
to
the
uninitiated
to
be
two
gallows
farther
on
rises
a
gentle
hill
crowned
with
massive
elms
from
among
which
tower
the
tops
of
a
number
of
picturesque
buildings
then
the
train
hurries
on
again
under
the
shadow
of
mount
adam
where
in
the
deep
maple
woods
the
squirrels
leap
all
day
among
the
tree
tops
and
where
the
sunlight
strives
year
after
year
to
find
its
way
through
the
thick
shade
and
once
more
the
river
is
beside
you
the
train
is
speeding
due
north
again
and
you
have
perhaps
without
knowing
it
caught
a
glimpse
of
hillton
academy
from
the
little
stone
station
a
queer
old
coach
rumbles
away
down
a
wide
country
road
it
carries
the
mail
and
the
village
supplies
and
less
often
a
traveler
and
the
driver
old
joe
pike
has
grown
gray
between
the
station
and
the

if
instead
of
going
on
to
the
north
you
had
descended
from
the
train
and
had
mounted
to
the
seat
beside
old
joe
you
would
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
very
worthy
member
of
hillton
society
and
besides
have
received
a
deal
of
information
as
the
two
stout
grays
trotted
along
yes
that
the
up
there
among
them
trees
that
buildin
with
the

the
buildin
and
the
squatty
one
that
you
can
just
see
is
one
of
the
halls

they
call
it
after
the
man
that
founded
the
school
the
big
new
buildin
is
another
of

here
where
we
turn

your
foot
on
that
if
you
please

the
right
kind

that

we
comin
to
academy
road
this
well
they
used
to
call
it
elm
street
but
it
generally
just
station
nowadays
now
you
can
see
the
school
pretty
well
sir
that
squatty
place
the
gymnasium
and
them
two
littler
houses
of
brick
the
laboratories
then
the
house
with
the
wide
piazza
that
professor
wheeler
house
he
the
principal
you

the
one
next
it
the
yellow
wooden
house
i
mean
that
what
they
call
hampton
house
it
a
dormatory
same
as
the
others
but
it
smaller
and
more
select
as
you
might
say
hold
tight
sir
around
this
corner
most
of
them
the
lads
sir
live
in
the
village
however
you
see
there
ai
rooms
enough
in
the
grounds
i
heard
the
other
day
that
there
nigh
on
to
two
hundred
and
twenty
boys
in
the
school
this
year
i
can
remember
when
they
but
sixty
and
it
was
the
biggest
boardin
school
for
boys
in
new
york
state
and
that
many
years
ago
neither
the
boys
oh
they
a
fine
lot
sir
a
bit
mischievous
at
times
of
course
but
we
used
to
in
the
village
and
bless
you
sir
what
can
you
expect
from
a
boy
anyhow
there
ai
none
of
perfect
by
a
long
shot
and
i
guess
i
ought
to
know
i
raised
eight
on
there
the
town
hall
and
courthouse
and
the
methodist
church
beyond
and
here
we
are
sir
at
the
eagle
and
an
hour
before
supper
thank
you
sir
get
ap
hillton
academy
claims
the
distinction
of
being
well
over
a
century
old
founded
in
by
one
peter
masters
a
very
good
and
learned
pedagogue
it
has
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
maintained
its
high
estate
among
boys
schools
the
original
charter
provides
that
there
be
and
hereby
is
established
an
academy
for
promoting
piety
and
virtue
and
for
the
education
of
youth
in
the
english
latin
and
greek
languages
in
writing
arithmetic
music
and
the
art
of
speaking
practical
geometry
logic
and
geography
and
such
other
of
the
liberal
arts
and
sciences
or
languages
as
opportunity
may
hereafter
permit
and
as
the
trustees
hereinafter
provided
shall
direct
in
the
catalogue
of
hillton
academy
you
may
find
a
proud
list
of
graduates
that
includes
ministers
plenipotentiary
members
of
cabinets
governors
senators
representatives
supreme
court
judges
college
presidents
authors
and
many
many
other
equally
creditable
to
their
alma
mater
the
founder
and
first
principal
of
the
academy
passed
away
in
as
an
old
record
says
full
of
honor
and
commanding
the
respect
and
love
of
all
who
knew
him
he
was
succeeded
by
that
of
american
schoolmasters
hosea
bradley
whose
portrait
showing
a
tall
dignified
and
hale
old
gentleman
with
white
hair
and
dressed
in
ceremonious
broadcloth
still
hangs
behind
the
chancel
of
the
school
chapel
bradley
resigned
a
few
years
before
his
death
in
and
the
present
principal
john
ross
wheeler
professor
of
latin
took
the
chair
as
professor
wheeler
is
a
man
of
inordinate
modesty
and
as
he
is
quite
likely
to
read
these
words
i
can
say
but
little
about
him
perhaps
the
statement
of
a
member
of
the
upper
middle
class
upon
his
return
from
a
visit
to
the
office
will
serve
to
throw
some
light
on
his
character
said
the
boy
i
tell
i
do
want
to
go
through
with
that
again
i
take
a
licking
first
he
says
things
that
count
you
see
has
been
a
boy
himself
and
he
has
forgotten
it
and
that
that
makes
a
difference
somehow
yes
that
disrespectful
lad
said
wheels
i
have
no
excuse
to
offer
for
him
i
only
relate
the
incident
as
it
occurred
the
buildings
many
of
them
a
hundred
years
old
are
with
one
exception
of
red
brick
the
gymnasium
is
built
of
red
sandstone
ivy
has
almost
entirely
hidden
the
walls
of
the
academy
building
and
of
masters
hall
the
grounds
are
given
over
to
sod
and
the
massive
elms
throw
a
tapestry
of
grateful
shade
in
summer
and
in
winter
hold
the
snow
upon
their
great
limbs
and
transform
the
green
into
a
fairyland
of
white
from
the
cluster
of
buildings
the
land
slopes
away
southward
and
along
the
river
bluff
a
footpath
winds
past
the
society
house
past
the
boathouse
steps
down
to
the
campus
the
path
is
bordered
by
firs
and
here
and
there
a
stunted
maple
bends
and
nods
to
the
passing
skiffs
opposite
the
boat
house
a
modest
bit
of
architecture
lies
long
isle
just
where
the
river
seemingly
pauses
for
a
deep
breath
after
its
bold
sweep
around
the
promontory
crowned
by
the
academy
buildings
here
and
there
along
the
path
are
little
wooden
benches
to
tempt
the
passer
to
rest
and
view
from
their
hospitable
seats
the
grand
panorama
of
gently
flowing
river
of
broad
marsh
and
meadow
beyond
of
tiny
villages
dotting
the
distances
and
of
the
purple
wall
of
haze
marking
the
line
of
the
distant
mountains
opposite
long
isle
a
wonderful
fairyland
inaccessible
to
the
scholars
save
on
rare
occasions
the
river
path
meets
the
angle
of
the
station
road
where
the
coach
makes
its
first
turn
then
the
path
grows
indistinct
merges
into
a
broad
plot
whereon
are
the
track
gridiron
baseball
ground
and
the
beginning
of
the
golf
links
this
is
the
campus
and
here
is
stony
bunker
and
beyond
it
is
the
bluff
and
the
granite
ledge
and
lo
here
we
are
back
again
at
the
point
from
which
we
started
on
our
journey
of
discovery
back
to
outfield
west
and
to
the
boy
in
the
ridiculous
straw
hat
chapter
iii
outfield
west
it
was
several
moments
before
west
recovered
his
breath
enough
to
speak
during
which
time
he
sat
and
gazed
at
his
rescuer
in
amazement
not
unmixed
with
curiosity
and
the
rescuer
looked
down
at
west
in
simple
amusement
thanks
gasped
west
at
length
i
suppose
i
have
broke
my
silly
neck
if
you
had
given
me
a
hand
just
when
you
did
the
other
nodded
you
welcome
of
course
but
i
do
believe
have
been
very
much
hurt
what
that
thing
nodding
toward
the
brassie
still
tightly
clutched
in
west
hand
a
bras
a
golf
club
i
was
knocking
a
ball
around
a
bit
and
it
went
over
the
cliff
here
i
should
think
golf
was
a
rather
funny
sort
of
a
game
it
is
funny
at
all
if
you
know
anything
about
it
replied
west
a
trifle
sharply
the
rescuer
was
on
dangerous
ground
had
he
but
known
it
is
it
well
i
guess
it
is
all
in
getting
used
to
it
i
believe
i
care
much
for
tumbling
over
cliffs
that
way
i
should
think
it
would
use
a
fellow
up
after
a
while
look
here
exclaimed
west
you
saved
me
an
ugly
fall
and
i
very
much
obliged
and
all
that
but
but
you
do
know
the
first
thing
about
golf
and
so
you
had
better
not
talk
about
it
he
made
an
effort
to
gain
his
feet
but
sat
down
again
with
a
groan
you
sit
still
a
while
said
the
boy
in
the
straw
hat
and
i
drop
down
and
get
that
ball
for
you
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
he
lowered
himself
over
the
ledge
and
slid
down
the
bank
to
the
beach
he
dropped
the
golf
ball
in
his
pocket
after
examining
it
with
deep
curiosity
and
started
back
but
the
return
was
less
easy
than
the
descent
had
been
the
bank
was
gravelly
and
his
feet
could
gain
no
hold
several
times
he
struggled
up
a
yard
or
so
only
to
slip
back
again
to
the
bottom
i
tell
you
what
you
do
called
west
leaning
over
you
get
a
bit
of
a
run
and
get
up
as
high
as
you
can
and
try
and
catch
hold
of
this
stick
then
i
pull
you
up
the
other
obeyed
and
succeeded
in
getting
a
firm
hold
of
the
brassie
but
the
rest
was
none
so
easy
west
pulled
and
the
other
boy
struggled
and
then
at
last
when
both
were
out
of
breath
the
straw
hat
rose
above
the
ledge
and
its
wearer
scrambled
up
sitting
down
beside
west
he
drew
the
ball
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
over
what
do
they
make
those
of
he
asked
gutta
percha
answered
west
then
they
molded
and
painted
this
way
you
never
played
golf
have
you
no
we
do
know
much
about
it
down
our
way
i
played
baseball
and
football
some
do
you
play
football
no
i
should
say
not
answered
west
scornfully
you
see
more
graciously
golf
takes
up
about
all
my
time
when
i
have
got
some
lesson
on
and
this
is
the
worst
place
for
lessons
you
ever
saw
a
chap
does
get
time
for
anything
else
the
other
boy
looked
puzzled
well
do
you
want
to
study
west
stared
in
amazement
study
want
to
of
course
i
do
do
you
very
much
that
what
i
came
to
school
for
oh
west
studied
the
strange
youth
dubiously
plainly
he
was
not
at
all
the
sort
of
boy
one
could
teach
golf
to
then
why
were
you
trying
for
the
football
team
awhile
ago
because
next
to
studying
i
want
to
play
football
more
than
anything
else
do
you
think
i
have
time
for
it
you
bet
and
say
you
ought
to
learn
golf
it
the
finest
sport
going
west
hopes
revived
a
fellow
that
wanted
sport
if
only
football
could
not
be
a
bad
sort
besides
he
would
get
over
wanting
to
study
that
to
west
was
a
most
unnatural
desire
there
is
half
a
dozen
really
players
in
school
you
get
some
clubs
and
teach
you
the
game
that
very
good
of
you
answered
the
boy
in
the
straw
hat
and
very
much
obliged
but
i
do
think
i
have
time
you
see
i
in
the
upper
middle
and
they
say
that
it
awfully
hard
to
keep
up
with
still
i
should
really
like
to
try
my
hand
at
it
and
if
i
have
time
i
ask
you
to
show
me
a
little
about
it
i
expect
you
the
best
player
here
are
you
west
extremely
gratified
tried
to
conceal
his
pleasure
oh
i
do
know
there
wesley
blair
he
captain
of
the
school
eleven
you
know
he
plays
a
very
good
game
only
he
has
a
way
of
missing
short
puts
and
then
there
louis
whipple
the
only
thing
about
whipple
is
that
he
tries
to
play
with
too
few
clubs
he
says
a
fellow
can
play
just
as
well
with
a
driver
and
a
putter
and
a
niblick
as
he
can
with
a
dozen
clubs
of
course
that
nonsense
if
whipple
would
use
some
brains
about
his
clubs
he
make
a
rather
fair
player
there
are
one
or
two
other
fellows
in
school
who
are
not
so
bad
but
i
believe
magnanimously
that
if
blair
had
more
time
for
practicing
he
could
beat
west
allowed
his
hearer
a
moment
in
which
to
digest
this
the
straw
hat
was
tilted
down
over
the
eyes
of
its
wearer
who
was
gazing
thoughtfully
over
the
river
i
suppose
he
kept
pretty
busy
with
football
yes
he
daft
about
it
otherwise
he
a
fine
chap
by
the
way
where
you
learn
to
kick
a
ball
that
way
on
the
farm
i
used
to
practice
when
i
did
have
much
to
do
which
was
very
often
jerry
green
and
i
jerry
our
hired
man
we
used
to
get
out
in
the
cow
pasture
and
kick
then
i
played
a
year
with
our
eleven
well
that
was
great
work
if
you
could
only
drive
a
golf
ball
like
that
say
what
your
name
joel
march
mine
outfield

all
right
now
though
i
a
bit
lame
after
that
tumble
the
two
boys
scrambled
up
the
bank
and
set
out
along
the
river
path
the
sun
had
gone
down
behind
the
mountains
and
purple
shadows
were
creeping
up
from
the
river
the

glowed

now

you
can
get
a
better
room
too
although
some
of
the
rooms
in

not
half
bad
they
cost
too
much
replied
march

very
well

much
he
pays
my
tuition
and
i
enough
money

so
of
course

be
careful

you
a
queer
chap
exclaimed
west
why

joel
march

of

he
gobs
i

of
the
year
west
stared

why
i
dead

this
minute
and
i
owe
three

rules
to

the
good
of
saving

lots
more
it
was
march
turn
to
stare
what
do
you
spend
it
for
he
asked
oh
golf
clubs
and
balls
and
cakes
and
pies
and
things
answered
west
carelessly
then
a
fellow
has
to
dress
a
little
or
the
other
fellows
look
down
on
you
do
they
march
cast
a
glance
over
his
own
worn
apparel
then
i
guess
i
must
try
their
eyes
a
good
deal
well
i
would
care
much
answered
west
halfheartedly
though
of
course
that
hat
yes
i
suppose
it
is
a
little
late
for
straws
west
nodded
heartily
i
was
going
to
get
a
felt
in
boston
but
well
i
saw
something
else
i
wanted
worse
and
it
was
my
own
money
what
was
it
asked
west
curiously
a
book
west
whistled
well
you
can
get
a
pretty
fair
one
in
the
village
at
grove
and
and
a
pair
of
trousers
if
you
want
them
march
nodded
noncommittingly
they
had
reached
the
gymnasium
i
going
in
for
a
shower
said
west
you
better
come
along
march
shook
his
head
i
guess
not
it
most
supper
time
and
i
want
to
read
a
little
first
answered
west
i
awfully
much
obliged
for
what
you
did
you
know
come
and
see
me
if
you
can
number
hampton
joel
march
turned
and
retraced
his
steps
to
his
dormitory
he
found
his
roommate
reading
at
the
table
when
he
entered
number
sproule
looked
up
and
observed
i
saw
you
with
outfield
west
a
moment
ago
it
looks
rather
funny
for
a
as
you
profess
to
be
hobnobbing
with
a
hampton
house
swell
i
have
professed
to
be
a
answered
joel
quietly
as
he
opened
his
greek
well
your
actions
profess
it
and
west
will
drop
you
quicker
than
a
hot
cake
when
he
finds
it
out
why
he
never
studies
a
lick
none
of
those
hampton
house
fellows
do
march
made
no
answer
but
presently
asked
in
an
effort
to
be
sociable
what
are
you
reading
the
three
cutters
ever
read
it
no
what
it
about
oh
pirates
and
smuggling
and
such
i
should
think
it
would
be
first
rate
it
is
i
let
you
take
it
after
i
through
only
it
is
mine
i
borrowed
it
from
billy
cozzens
thanks
answered
joel
but
i
do
believe
i
have
time
for
it
humph
grunted
sproule
there
you
are
again
putting
on
airs
just
wait
until
you
been
here
two
or
three
months
i
guess
i
wo
hear
so
much
about
study
then
joel
received
this
taunt
in
silence
and
burying
his
head
in
his
hands
tackled
the
story
of
cyrus
the
younger
joel
had
already
come
to
a
decision
regarding
richard
sproule
a
decision
far
from
flattering
to
that
youth
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
two
were
destined
to
spend
much
of
their
time
together
joel
recognized
the
necessity
of
making
the
best
of
his
roommate
and
of
what
appeared
to
be
an
unsatisfactory
condition
during
the
two
days
that
joel
had
been
in
school
sproule
had
nagged
him
incessantly
upon
one
subject
or
another
and
so
far
joel
had
borne
the
persecution
in
silence
but
some
day
mused
joel
i
just
to
punch
his
head
richard
sproule
was
a
member
of
the
senior
class
and
monitor
for
the
floor
upon
which
he
had
his
room
he
had
perhaps
no
positive
meanness
in
him
most
of
his
unpleasantness
was
traceable
to
envy
just
at
present
he
was
cultivating
a
dislike
for
joel
because
of
the
enviable
success
at
lessons
and
because
a
resident
of
hampton
house
had
taken
him
up
sproule
cared
nothing
for
amusements
and
hated
lessons
his
whole
time
except
when
study
was
absolutely
compulsory
was
taken
up
with
the
reading
of
books
of
adventure
and
captain
marryat
and
fenimore
cooper
were
far
closer
acquaintances
than
either
cicero
or
caesar
richard
sproule
was
popularly
disliked
and
shunned
in
the
dining
hall
that
evening
joel
ate
and
relished
his
first
hearty
meal
since
he
had
arrived
at
hillton
the
exercise
had
brought
back
a
naturally
good
appetite
which
had
been
playing
truant
the
dining
hall
takes
up
most
of
the
ground
floor
of
warren
hall
eight
long
roomy
tables
are
arranged
at
intervals
with
broad
aisles
between
through
which
the
waiters
hurry
noiselessly
about
there
was
a
cheerful
clatter
of
spoons
and
forks
and
a
loud
babel
of
voices
and
joel
found
himself
hugely
enjoying
the
novelty
of
eating
in
the
presence
of
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
other
lads
outfield
west
and
his
neighbors
in
hampton
house
occupied
a
far
table
and
there
the
noise
was
loudest
west
was
dressed
like
a
young
prince
and
his
associates
were
equally
as
splendid
as
joel
observed
them
west
glanced
across
and
saw
him
and
waved
a
hilarious
greeting
with
a
soup
spoon
joel
nodded
laughingly
back
and
then
settled
in
his
chair
with
an
agreeable
sensation
of
being
among
friends
this
feeling
grew
when
toward
the
end
of
his
meal
wesley
blair
in
leaving
the
hall
saw
him
and
stopped
beside
his
chair
how
did
you
get
on
this
afternoon
blair
asked
pleasantly
very
well
thanks
joel
replied
that
good
by
the
way
go
and
see
beck
and
get
examined
tell
him
i
sent
you
you
find
him
at
the
gym
at
about
eleven
and
do
forget
to
show
up
at
practice
the
elder
youth
passed
on
leaving
joel
the
center
of
interest
for
several
moments
his
neighbor
a
boy
who
affected
very
red
neckties
and
who
had
hitherto
displayed
no
interest
in
his
presence
now
turned
and
asked
if
he
knew
blair
no
replied
joel
i
met
him
only
on
the
football
field
are
you
on
the
no
but
i
trying
for
it
well
i
guess
you
make
it
blair
does
often
go
out
of
his
way
to
encourage
any
one
i
hope
i
shall
answered
joel
who
is
beck
please
he
director
of
the
gym
you
have
to
be
examined
you
know
if
you
do
come
up
to
requirements
you
ca
go
in
for
football
oh
thank
you
and
joel
applied
himself
to
his
pudding
and
wondered
if
there
was
any
possibility
of
his
not
passing
apparently
there
was
not
for
when
on
the
following
day
he
presented
himself
at
the
gymnasium
he
came
through
the
ordeal
of
measurement
and
test
with
flying
colors
and
with
the
command
to
pay
special
attention
to
the
was
released
at
liberty
to
go
in
for
any
sport
he
liked
despite
his
forebodings
the
studies
proved
not
formidable
and
at
four
joel
reported
for
football
practice
with
a
comforting
knowledge
of
duties
performed
an
hour
and
a
half
of
steady
practice
consisting
of
passing
falling
and
catching
punts
left
the
inexperienced
candidates
in
a
state
of
breathless
collapse
when
blair
dismissed
the
field
west
did
not
turn
up
at
the
gridiron
but
a
tiny
scarlet
speck
far
off
on
the
golf
links
proclaimed
his
whereabouts
on
the
way
back
to
the
grounds
a
number
of
youthful
juniors
bravely
arrayed
in
their
first
suits
of
football
togs
loudly
denounced
the
vigor
of
the
practice
and
pantingly
made
known
to
each
other
their
intentions
to
let
the
school
get
along
as
best
it
might
without
their
assistance
on
its
eleven
they
would
be
no
great
loss
thought
joel
as
he
trudged
along
in
the
rear
of
the
procession
and
their
resignation
would
probably
save
blair
the
necessity
of
incurring
their
dislikes
when
the
process
of
began
although
no
special
attention
had
been
given
to
joel
during
practice
yet
he
had
been
constantly
aware
of
blair
observation
and
had
known
that
several
of
the
older
fellows
were
watching
his
work
with
interest
his
feat
of
the
previous
day
had
already
secured
to
him
a
reputation
throughout
the
school
and
as
the
little
groups
of
boys
passed
him
he
heard
himself
alluded
to
as
the
country
fellow
that
punted
fifty
yards
yesterday
or
the
chap
that
made
that
kick
and
when
the
three
long
steep
flights
of
masters
confronted
him
he
took
them
two
steps
at
a
time
and
arrived
before
the
door
of
number
breathless
but
as
happy
as
a
schoolboy
can
be
chapter
iv
the
head
coach
upper
middle
class
members
will
meet
at
the
gym
at
to
march
to
depot
and
meet
mr
remsen
louis
whipple
this
was
the
notice
pasted
on
the
board
in
academy
building
the
morning
of
joel
fifth
day
at
school
beside
it
were
similar
announcements
to
members
of
the
other
classes
as
he
stood
in
front
of
the
board
joel
felt
a
hand
laid
on
his
shoulder
and
turned
to
find
outfield
west
by
his
side
are
you
going
along
asked
that
youth
i
do
believe
so
answered
joel
i
have
a
latin
recitation
at
two
well
chuck
it
everybody
is
going
and
the
band
worse
luck
is
there
a
band
west
threw
up
his
hands
in
mock
despair
is
there
a
there
a
band
march
your
ignorance
surprises
and
pains
me
it
is
quite
evident
that
you
have
never
heard
the
hillton
academy
band
no
one
who
has
ever
heard
it
forgets
yes
my
boy
there
a
band
and
it
plays
washington
post
and
hail
columbia
and
hilltonians
and
then
it
plays
them
all
over
again
but
i
thought
remsen
was
not
coming
until
saturday
that
replied
west
confidentially
was
his
intention
but
he
heard
of
a
youngster
up
here
who
is
such
an
astonishingly
fine
punter
that
he
decided
to
come
at
once
and
see
for
himself
and
so
he
telegraphed
to
blair
this
morning
and
you
and
i
my
lad
will
march
see
with
the
procession
and
sing
hilltonians
your
crimson
banner
fling
unto
the
breeze
and
its
folds
your
anthem
loudly
sing
hilltonians
hilltonians
we
stand
to
do
or
die
beneath
the
flag
the
crimson
flag
that
waves
for
victory
and
seizing
joel
by
the
arm
west
dragged
him
out
of
the
corridor
and
down
the
steps
into
the
warm
sunlight
of
a
september
noon
chanting
the
school
song
at
the
top
of
his
voice
a
group
of
boys
on
the
green
shouted
lustily
back
and
the
occupant
of
a
neighboring
window
threw
a
cushion
with
unerring
precision
at
west
head
stopping
to
deposit
this
safely
amid
the
branches
halfway
up
an
elm
tree
the
two
youths
sped
across
the
yard
toward
warren
hall
and
the
dinner
table
you
sit
at
our
table
march
announced
west
digbee
away
and
you
can
have
his
seat
come
on
joel
followed
and
found
himself
in
the
coveted
precincts
of
the
hampton
house
table
and
was
introduced
to
five
youths
who
received
him
very
graciously
and
invited
him
to
partake
of
such
luxuries
as
pickled
walnuts
and
peach
marmalade
joel
was
fast
making
the
discovery
that
to
be
vouched
for
by
outfield
west
invariably
secured
the
highest
consideration
i
been
telling
march
here
that
it
is
his
bounden
duty
to
go
to
the
station
announced
west
to
the
table
at
large
of
course
it
is
answered
cooke
and
cartwright
and
somers
and
two
others
whose
names
joel
did
not
catch
the
wealth
beauty
and
fashion
will
attend
in
a
body
continued
cooke
a
stout
boy
of
about
nineteen
who
as
joel
afterward
learned
was
universally
acknowledged
to
be
the
dullest
scholar
in
school
patriotism
and
er
school
spirit
you
know
march
demand
it
and
cooke
helped
himself
bountifully
to
west
cherished
bottle
of
catsup
this
is
remsen
last
year
as
coach
you
see
explained
west
as
he
rescued
the
catsup
i
believe
every
fellow
feels
that
we
ought
to
show
our
appreciation
of
his
work
by
turning
out
in
force
it
the
least
we
can
do
i
think
mind
you
i
do
fancy
football
a
little
bit
but
remsen
taught
us
to
win
from
eustace
last
year
and
any
one
that
helps
down
eustace
is
all
right
and
deserves
the
gratitude
of
the
school
and
all
honest
folk
hear
hear
cried
somers
i
like
very
well
to
go
said
joel
but
i
got
a
recitation
at
two
cooke
looked
across
at
him
sorrowfully
are
you
going
in
for
study
he
asked
i
afraid
so
answered
joel
laughingly
my
boy
do
do
it
there
nothing
gained
i
tried
it
and
i
speak
from
sad
experience
but
how
do
you
get
through
questioned
joel
i
will
tell
you
the
stout
youth
leaned
over
and
lowered
his
voice
to
a
confidential
whisper
i
belong
to
the
same
society
as
and
he
does
dare
expel
me
i
wish
said
joel
in
the
laugh
that
followed
that
i
could
join
that
society
easy
enough
answered
cooke
earnestly
i
will
put
your
name
up
at
our
next
meeting
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
forget
all
the
greek
and
latin
and
higher
mathematics
you
ever
knew
give
your
oath
never
to
study
again
and
appear
at
chapel
two
consecutive
mornings
in
thigh
boots
and
a
plaid
ulster
despite
west
pleas
joel
refused
to
cut
his
recitation
promising
however
to
follow
to
the
station
as
soon
as
he
might
it
only
a
long
mile
west
asserted
if
you
cut
across
meadow
you
make
it
in
no
time
and
the
train
is
due
until
three
you
see
me
standing
on
the
truck
and
so
joel
had
promised
and
later
from
the
seclusion
of
the
schoolroom
which
was
empty
had
heard
the
procession
take
its
way
down
the
road
headed
by
the
school
band
which
woke
the
echoes
with
the
brave
strains
of
the
washington
post
march
the
aeneid
lost
much
of
its
interest
and
when
the
recitation
was
over
joel
clapped
his
new
brown
felt
hat
on
his
head
for
west
had
conducted
him
to
the
village
outfitter
the
preceding
day
and
hurried
up
to
his
room
to
leave
his
book
and
pad
dickey
sproule
was
stretched
out
upon
the
lounge
a
piece
of
personal
property
of
which
he
was
very
proud
reading
kenilworth
hello
cried
joel
why
are
you
over
at
the
lab
is
this
your
day
for
exploding
things
sproule
looked
up
and
yawned
oh
i
cut
it
what
the
good
of
knowing
a
lot
of
silly
chemistry
stuff
when
you
going
to
be
an
author
i
should
say
it
might
be
very
useful
to
you
but
i
never
been
an
author
and
perhaps
i
mistaken
want
to
go
to
the
station
what
to
meet
that
remsen
i
guess
not
catch
me
walking
a
mile
and
a
half
to
see
him
well
i
going
answered
joel
an
inarticulate
growl
was
the
only
response
and
joel
took
the
stairs
at
leaps
and
bounds
and
nearly
upset
cowles
in
the
lower
hall
dear
me
mr
march
she
exclaimed
as
together
they
gathered
up
a
load
of
towels
is
it
only
you
then
i
thought
surely
it
was
a
dozen
boys
at
least
i
very
sorry
laughed
joel
i
going
to
the
station
remsen
is
coming
you
know
have
i
spoiled
these
no
indeed
so
remsen
coming
well
run
along
i
go
myself
if
i
was
an
old
woman
i
knew
remsen
ten
years
ago
and
a
more
bothersome
lad
we
never
had
he
had
number
and
we
never
knew
what
to
expect
next
one
week
he
set
the
building
on
fire
with
his
experiments
and
the
next
he
break
all
the
panes
in
the
window
with
his
football
but
then
he
was
such
a
nice
boy
and
with
this
seemingly
contradictory
statement
the
matron
trudged
away
with
her
armful
of
towels
and
joel
took
up
his
flight
again
across
the
yard
to
academy
road
and
thence
over
the
fence
into
turner
meadows
where
the
hill
starts
on
its
rise
to
the
village
skirting
the
hill
he
trudged
on
until
presently
the
station
could
be
seen
in
the
distance
and
as
he
went
he
reviewed
the
five
days
of
his
school
existence
he
remembered
the
strange
feeling
of
loneliness
that
had
oppressed
him
on
his
arrival
when
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
over
the
river
he
had
dropped
down
from
the
old
stage
coach
in
front
of
academy
hall
a
shabbily
dressed
country
boy
with
a
dilapidated
leather
valise
and
a
brown
paper
parcel
almost
as
big
he
remembered
the
looks
of
scorn
and
derision
that
had
met
him
as
he
had
taken
his
way
to
the
office
and
with
a
glow
at
his
heart
the
few
simple
kindly
words
of
welcome
and
the
firm
grasp
of
the
hand
from
the
principal
then
came
the
first
day
at
school
with
the
dread
examinations
which
after
all
turned
out
to
be
fairly
easy
thanks
to
joel
faculty
for
remembering
what
he
had
once
learned
he
remembered
too
the
disparaging
remarks
of
dickey
sproule
who
had
predicted
joel
failure
at
the
who
ever
heard
sproule
had
asked
scornfully
of
a
fellow
making
the
upper
middle
class
straight
out
of
a
country
grammar
school
without
any
coaching
but
when
the
lists
were
posted
joel
name
was
down
and
sproule
had
taken
deep
offense
thereat
the
school
going
to
the
dogs
he
had
complained
examinations
are
nearly
as
hard
as
they
were
when
entered
the
third
day
when
he
had
kicked
that
football
down
the
field
and
later
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
outfield
west
seemed
now
to
have
been
the
turning
point
from
gloom
to
sunshine
since
then
joel
had
changed
from
the
unknown
derided
youth
in
the
straw
hat
to
some
one
of
importance
a
some
one
to
whom
the
captain
of
the
school
eleven
spoke
whenever
they
met
a
chum
of
the
most
envied
boy
in
the
academy
and
a
candidate
for
the
football
team
for
whom
every
fellow
predicted
success
but
best
of
all
in
those
few
days
he
had
gained
the
liking
of
all
of
the
teachers
by
the
hearty
way
in
which
he
pursued
knowledge
for
he
went
at
caesar
as
though
he
were
trying
for
a
and
tackled
the
foundations
of
rhetoric
as
though
that
study
was
an
opponent
on
the
gridiron
even
professor
durkee
known
familiarly
among
the
disrespectful
as
turkey
lowered
his
tones
and
spoke
with
something
approaching
to
mildness
when
addressing
joel
march
altogether
the
world
looked
very
bright
to
joel
and
when
as
presently
he
drew
near
to
the
little
stone
depot
the
sounds
of
singing
and
cheering
that
greeted
his
ears
chimed
in
well
with
his
mood
truly
all
hillton
had
turned
out
the
station
platform
and
the
trim
graveled
road
surrounding
it
were
dark
with
hilltonian
humanity
and
gay
with
crimson
bunting
afar
down
the
road
a
shrill
long
whistle
announced
the
approach
of
the
train
and
a
comparative
hush
fell
on
the
crowd
joel
descried
outfield
west
at
once
and
pushed
his
way
to
him
through
the
throng
just
as
the
train
came
into
sight
down
the
track
west
was
surrounded
on
the
narrow
baggage
truck
by
some
half
dozen
of
the
choice
spirits
from
hampton
house
and
joel
advent
was
made
the
occasion
for
much
sport
ah
he
comes
the
professor
comes
shouted
west
he
tears
himself
from
his
studies
and
joins
us
in
our
frivolity
declaimed
cooke
that
something
you
never
have
a
chance
of
doing
tom
answered
cartwright
as
joel
was
hauled
on
to
the
truck
you
never
get
near
enough
to
a
study
to
have
to
be
torn
away
study
my
respected
young
friend
answered
cooke
gravely
is
the
bane
of
the
present
unenlightened
age
in
the
good
old
days
when
everybody
was
either
a
greek
or
a
roman
or
a
barbarian
and
so
have
to
study
languages
and
shut
up
here
the
train
cried
west
now
every
fellow
cheer
or
he
have
me
to
fight
hooray
hooray
hooray
yelled
cooke
somebody
punch
him
please
begged
west
and
somers
and
another
obliging
youth
thrust
the
offender
off
the
truck
and
sat
on
his
head
the
train
slowed
down
stopped
and
a
porter
appeared
laden
with
a
huge
valise
this
was
the
signal
for
a
rush
and
the
darkey
was
instantly
relieved
of
his
burden
and
hustled
back
grinning
to
the
platform
then
joel
caught
sight
of
a
gentleman
in
a
neat
suit
of
gray
tweed
descending
the
steps
and
saw
the
pupils
heave
and
push
their
ways
toward
him
and
for
a
sight
the
arrival
was
hidden
from
view
then
the
cheers
for
coach
burst
enthusiastically
forth
the
train
was
speeding
from
sight
up
the
track
the
band
was
playing
hilltonians
and
the
procession
took
up
its
march
back
to
the
academy
when
he
at
last
caught
a
fair
sight
of
stephen
remsen
joel
saw
a
man
of
about
years
gayly
trudging
at
the
head
of
the
line
his
handsome
face
smiling
brightly
as
he
replied
to
the
questions
and
sallies
of
the
more
elderly
youths
who
surrounded
him
joel
heart
went
out
to
stephen
remsen
at
once
and
neither
then
nor
at
any
future
time
did
he
wonder
at
it
that
thought
joel
is
the
kind
of
fellow
i
like
for
a
big
brother
although
i
never
grow
big
enough
to
lick
him
chapter
a
rainy
afternoon
the
following
day
joel
arrived
on
the
football
field
to
discover
the
head
coach
in
full
charge
he
was
talking
earnestly
to
wesley
blair
his
dress
was
less
immaculate
than
upon
the
preceding
afternoon
although
not
a
whit
less
attractive
to
joel
a
pair
of
faded
and
striped
stockings
were
surmounted
by
a
pair
of
soiled
and
patched
moleskin
trousers
his
crimson
jersey
had
faded
at
the
shoulders
to
a
pathetic
shade
of
pink
and
one
sleeve
was
missing
having
long
since
gone
over
to
the
enemy
in
contrast
to
these
articles
of
apparel
was
his
new
immaculate
canvas
jacket
laced
for
the
first
time
but
a
moment
before
but
he
looked
the
football
man
that
he
was
from
head
to
toe
and
joel
admired
him
immensely
and
was
extremely
proud
when
as
he
was
passing
blair
called
him
over
and
introduced
him
to
remsen
the
latter
shook
hands
cordially
and
allowed
his
gaze
to
travel
appreciatingly
over
joel
five
feet
eight
inches
of
bone
and
muscle
i
glad
to
know
you
march
he
said
and
glad
that
you
are
going
to
help
us
win
the
greeting
was
so
simple
and
sincere
that
joel
ran
down
the
field
a
moment
later
feeling
that
football
honors
were
even
more
desirable
than
before
the
throng
of
candidates
had
dwindled
down
to
some
forty
of
whom
perhaps
twenty
were
new
men
the
first
and
second
elevens
were
lined
up
for
the
first
time
and
joel
was
placed
at
left
half
in
the
latter
an
hour
of
slow
practice
followed
the
ball
was
given
to
the
first
eleven
on
almost
every
play
and
as
the
second
eleven
were
kept
entirely
on
the
defensive
joel
had
no
chance
to
show
his
ability
at
either
rushing
or
kicking
remsen
was
everywhere
at
once
scolding
warning
and
encouraging
in
a
breath
and
the
play
took
on
a
snap
and
vim
which
wesley
blair
unassisted
had
not
been
able
to
introduce
after
it
was
over
joel
trotted
back
with
the
others
to
the
gymnasium
and
took
his
first
shower
bath
on
the
steps
outside
was
west
and
the
two
boys
took
their
way
together
to
the
academy
building
did
you
hear
remsen
getting
after
bart
cloud
asked
west
no
who
is
cloud
he
plays
right
half
or
left
half
i
forget
which
on
the
first
eleven
answered
west
and
he
about
the
biggest
cad
in
the
school
his
father
an
alderman
in
new
york
they
say
and
has
lots
of
money
but
he
does
let
bart
handle
much
of
it
for
him
he
played
on
the
team
last
year
and
did
good
work
but
this
season
he
got
a
swelled
head
and
thinks
he
does
have
to
play
to
keep
his
place
thinks
it
mortgaged
to
him
you
see
remsen
opened
his
eyes
i
guess
whipple
says
remsen
called
him
down
twice
and
then
told
him
if
he
did
take
a
big
brace
he
lose
his
position
cloud
got
mad
and
told
clausen
his
chum
that
if
he
went
off
the
team
he
leave
school
i
guess
few
of
us
would
be
sorry
bartlett
cloud
a
coward
from
the
toes
up
march
and
if
he
tries
to
make
it
unpleasant
for
you
why
just
offer
to
knock
him
down
and
he
change
his
tune
thank
you
for
telling
me
responded
joel
but
i
do
expect
to
have
much
to
do
with
him
i
do
like
his
looks
i
know
the
boy
you
mean
now
he
the
fellow
that
called
me
names
you
know
and
such
the
first
day
we
had
practice
i
heard
him
but
did
let
on
i
did
mind
much
but
it
did
win
my
love
west
laughed
uproariously
and
slapped
joel
on
the
back
oh
you
a
queer
sort
march
i
have
had
a
fight
on
the
spot
but
you
say
you
going
to
be
an
awful
grind
march
if
you
keep
on
in
your
present
terrible
course
you
wo
have
time
for
any
fun
at
all
and
i
was
going
to
teach
you
golf

know
it

of
you

i
play
golf
with
you
the
first
afternoon
we
do
have
practice
west
honestly
i
awfully
sorry
i
such
a
crank
about
lessons
but
you
see
i
made
up
my
mind
to
try
for
the
the
what
scholarship
is
that
carmichael
suggested
west
joel
shook
his
head
no
the
big
one
west
stared
do
you
mean
the
goodwin
scholarship
yes
that
the
one
answered
joel
west
whistled
well
you
not
modest
to
hurt
march
why
man
that
a
terror
you
have
to
have
the
greek
alphabet
backward
and
never
miss
chapel
all
term
to
get
a
show
at
that
the
goodwin
brings
two
hundred
and
forty
dollars
that
why
i
want
it
answered
joel
if
i
win
it
it
will
pay
my
expenses
for
this
year
and
part
of
next
well
of
course
i
hope
you
make
it
answered
west
but
i
believe
you
have
much
show
there
knox
and
reeves
and
and
two
or
three
others
all
trying
for
it
knox
won
the
schall
scholarship
last
year
that
carries
two
hundred
even
well
anyhow
i
try
hard
answered
joel
resolutely
of
course
you
ought
to
have
it
you
need
it
did
i
tell
you
that
i
won
a
masters
scholarship
in
my
junior
year
yes
i
did
really
it
was
forty
dollars
i
remember
that
i
bought
two
new
putters
and
a
jolly
fine
caddie
bag
you
could
do
better
than
that
if
you
try
west
you
awfully
smart
who
me
laughed
west
pshaw
i
ca
do
any
more
than
pass
my
exams
of
course
i
smart
enough
when
it
comes
to
lofting
out
of
a
bad
lie
or
choosing
a
good
club
but
he
shook
his
head
doubtfully
but
nevertheless
seemed
pleased
at
the
idea
no
i
mean
in
other
ways
continued
joel
earnestly
you
could
do
better
than
half
the
fellows
if
you
tried
and
i
wish
you
would
try
west
you
rich
fellows
in
hampton
house
could
set
such
a
good
example
for
the
youngsters
if
you
only
would
as
it
is
they
admire
you
and
envy
you
and
think
that
it
smart
to
give
all
their
time
to
play
i
know
because
i
heard
some
of
them
talking
about
it
the
other
day
have
to
study
said
one
at
those
swells
in
hampton
they
just
go
in
for
football
and
golf
and
tennis
and
all
that
and
they
never
have
any
trouble
about
passing
exams
west
whistled
in
puzzled
amazement
why
march
you
setting
out
as
a
reformer
and
you
talking
just
like
one
of
those
good
boys
in
the
story
books
what
up
joel
smiled
at
the
other
boy
look
of
wonderment
nothing
up
except
that
i
want
you
to
promise
to
study
more
of
course
i
know
it
sounds
cheeky
west
but
i
do
mean
to
meddle
in
your
business
only
only
joel
hesitated
only
what
out
with
it
said
west
they
had
reached
the
academy
building
and
had
paused
on
the
steps
well
only
that
you
been
very
kind
to
me
west
and
i
hate
to
see
you
wasting
your
time
and
know
that
you
will
wish
you
had
later
when
you
left
school
you
know
that
all
it
is
that
i
want
to
meddle
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
then
the
idea
of
your
caring
answered
west
you
a
good
chap
march
and
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
go
in
more
for
lessons
after
next
week
you
see
there
the
golf
tournament
next
saturday
week
and
i
got
to
put
in
a
lot
of
hard
practice
between
now
and
then
but
after
that
i
try
and
buckle
down
you
right
about
it
march
i
ought
to
do
more
studying
and
i
will
although
i
do
believe
i
make
much
of
a
success
as
a
and
as
to
the
the
the
rest
that
you
said
why
i
have
been
extraordinarily
kind
i
just
sort
of
took
to
you
that
day
on
the
campus
because
you
looked
to
be
such
a
plucky
chap
you
know
i
thought
i
rescue
you
from
the
ranks
of
the
lowly
and
teach
you
golf
and
make
a
man
of
you
generally
instead
of
that
west
gave
one
of
his
expressive
whistles
instead
of
that
why
here
you
are
turning
me
into
a
regular
hall
grind
thus
do
our
brightest
dreams
fade
well
i
oil
do
forget
the
upper
middle
class
meeting
they
going
to
vote
on
the
class
crew
question
and
we
want
all
the
votes
we
can
get
to
down
the
fellows
that
do
want
to
pay
the
assessment
and
outfield
west
took
himself
off
toward
his
room
his
broad
shoulders
well
back
and
his
clear
merry
voice
singing
the
school
song
as
he
strode
along
joel
turned
into
the
library
feeling
well
satisfied
with
the
result
of
his
meddling
to
pore
over
a
reference
book
until
supper
time
the
following
morning
joel
awoke
to
find
a
cold
rain
falling
from
a
dull
sky
the
elms
in
the
yard
were
dripping
from
every
leaf
and
branch
and
the
walks
held
little
gray
pools
that
made
the
trip
to
breakfast
a
series
of
splashes
in
the
afternoon
joel
got
into
his
oldest
clothes
and
tramped
over
to
hampton
house
the
window
of
west
room
looked
bright
and
cheerful
for
a
big
wood
fire
was
blazing
on
the
hearth
within
joel
kicked
the
mud
from
his
shoes
and
passing
through
the
great
white
door
with
its
fanlight
above
tapped
at
room
a
faint
response
from
beyond
the
portal
summoned
him
in
the
owner
of
the
room
was
sandpapering
a
golf
shaft
before
the
fire
and
a
deep
expression
of
discontent
was
on
his
face
but
his
countenance
lighted
up
at
sight
of
his
visitor
and
he
leaped
to
his
feet
and
drew
a
second
armchair
before
the
hearth
you
a
brick
march
i
was
just
wishing
you
roomed
near
enough
so
that
i
could
ask
you
to
come
over
and
talk
a
bit
is
it
a
horrible
day
it
awfully
wet
but
then
it
has
to
rain
sometimes
i
suppose
answered
joel
as
he
took
off
his
overcoat
yes
but
it
does
have
to
rain
just
when
a
fellow
has
fixed
to
practice
golf
does
it
west
growled
joel
laughed
i
thought
the
real
golfer
did
mind
the
weather
he
does
as
long
as
he
can
get
over
the
ground
but
the
links
here
is
like
a
quagmire
when
it
rains
but
never
mind
we
have
a
good
chummy
afternoon
and
i
got
some
bully
gingersnaps
do
you
like
gingersnaps
joel
replied
in
the
affirmative
and
west
produced
a
box
of
them
from
under
the
bed
i
have
to
keep
these
kinds
of
things
hid
you
know
because
blair
and
cooke
and
the
rest
of
the
fellows
would
eat
them
all
up
by
the
way
i
made
up
a
list
of
the
things
you
have
to
get
if
you
going
in
for
golf
here
it
is
of
course
i
only
put
down
one
of
each
and
only
a
dozen
balls
i
get
the
catalogue
and
we
reckon
up
and
see
how
much
they
come
to
but
i
do
think
i
can
afford
to
buy
anything
like
this
west
answered
joel
doubtfully
nonsense
you
got
to
a
fellow
has
to
have
what
the
first
thing
on
the
list
read
off
will
you
driving
cleek
read
joel
yes
but
never
mind
the
clubs
there
are
seven
of
them
on
the
list
and
you
can
get
pretty
fair
ones
for
a
dollar
and
a
half
each
what
next
but
that
makes
ten
dollars
and
a
half
cried
joel
of
course
it
does
and
cheap
enough
too
why
some
of
mine
cost
three
dollars
apiece
what
next
one
dozen
silvertowns
correct
four
dollars
mark
it
down
next
caddie
bag
responded
joel
faintly
a
dollar
and
a
half
next
but
west
i
ca
afford
these
things
nonsense
march
still
well
you
can
call
the
bag
a
dollar
even
though
the
dollar
ones
are
worth
much
mine
cost
five
but
you
have
coat
and
trousers
down
and
shoes
and
well
you
can
leave
the
shoes
out
and
get
some
hobnails
and
put
them
on
the
soles
of
any
good
heavy
shoes
then
there
gloves
they
cost
about
a
dollar
and
a
half
as
for
trousers
you
do
with
ordinary
ones
but
you
got
to
have
a
coat
march
a
chap
ca
swing
a
club
in
a
jacket
like
the
one
you
got
on
now
reckon
up
there
no
use
in
doing
that
west
laughed
joel
i
ca
buy
one
of
these
things
to
say
nothing
of
the
whole
list
i
saving
up
for
my
football
togs
and
after
i
have
those
i
be
able
to
buy
anything
else
for
months
west
settled
his
chin
in
his
hand
and
scowled
at
the
flames
it
too
bad
march
and
i
put
your
name
up
for
the
golf
club
too
you
will
join
that
wo
you
you
must
now
that
i
put
you
up
it
only
a
dollar
initiation
fee
and
fifty
cents
dues
very
well
then
i
join
the
club
answered
joel
though
i
see
what
use
there
is
in
it
since
i
have
anything
to
play
with
and
would
know
how
to
play
if
i
had
well
i
going
to
teach
you
you
know
and
as
for
clubs
and
things
why
i
got
some
oldish
ones
that
will
do
fairly
well
a
beginner
does
need
extra
good
ones
you
see
and
then
for
clothes
well
i
guess
fellows
played
in
ordinary
trousers
and
coat
and
played
myself
in
tennis
shoes
and
if
you
do
mind
cold
hands
why
you
need
have
gloves
so
after
all
we
get
on
all
right
west
was
quite
cheerful
again
and
with
a
wealth
of
clubs
divers
spoons
bulgers
putters
baps
niblicks
and
many
other
sorts
on
the
rug
before
him
chattered
on
about
past
deeds
of
prowess
on
the
links
until
the
room
grew
dark
and
the
lamps
in
the
yard
shone
fitfully
through
the
rain
by
which
time
a
dozen
clubs
in
various
states
of
repair
had
been
laid
aside
the
gingersnaps
had
been
totally
demolished
and
west
had
forgotten
all
about
the
meanness
of
the
weather
and
his
lost
practice
then
cooke
and
somers
demanded
admission
to
the
annoyance
of
both
west
and
joel
and
the
lamps
were
lighted
and
joel
said
and
hurried
back
to
his
room
in
order
to
secure
a
half
hour
study
ere
supper
time
chapter
vi
the
practice
game
first
and
second
eleven
rushes
and
quarters
down
the
field
and
practice
formations
backs
remain
here
to
kick
shouted
wesley
blair
it
was
a
dull
and
cold
afternoon
the
last
recitation
was
over
and
half
the
school
stood
shivering
about
the
gridiron
or
played
leapfrog
to
keep
warm
stephen
remsen
in
the
grimiest
of
moleskins
stood
talking
to
the
captain
and
in
obedience
to
the
command
of
the
latter
some
fifteen
youths
clad
for
the
coming
fray
were
trotting
down
the
field
while
eight
others
backs
and
substitute
backs
on
the
two
teams
passed
and
dropped
on
the
pigskin
in
an
endeavor
to
keep
warm
the
first
and
second
elevens
were
to
play
their
first
real
game
of
the
season
at
four
and
meanwhile
the
players
were
down
for
a
stiff
thirty
minutes
of
practice
joel
march
shivered
with
the
rest
of
the
backs
and
waited
for
the
coach
and
the
captain
to
finish
their
consultation
presently
blair
trotted
off
down
the
field
and
remsen
turned
to
the
backs
browne
meach
and
turner
go
down
to
about
the
middle
of
the
field
and
return
the
balls
cloud
take
a
ball
over
nearer
the
and
try
some
post
you
do
the
same
please
and
let
me
see
what
is
your
name
addressing
a
and
rather
slight
youth
ah
yes
clausen
well
clausen
you
and
wills
try
some
punts
over
there
and
do
try
and
get
the
leg
swing
right
march
take
that
ball
and
let
me
see
you
punt
then
began
a
time
of
sore
tribulation
for
joel
for
not
until
ten
minutes
had
passed
did
the
ball
touch
his
toe
his
handling
was
wrong
his
stepping
out
was
wrong
and
his
was
very
very
wrong
but
he
heard
never
a
cross
word
from
his
instructor
and
so
shut
his
lips
tight
and
bore
the
lecture
in
silence
there
announced
remsen
finally
that
a
lot
better
now
kick
joel
caught
the
ball
nicely
and
sent
it
sailing
far
down
the
field
that
a
good
kick
but
it
would
have
been
better
had
you
landed
higher
up
on
your
foot
try
and
catch
the
ball
just
in
front
of
the
arch
of
the
foot
you
take
it
about
on
the
remember
that
the
broader
the
surface
that
propels
the
ball
the
greater
will
be
the
accuracy
that
is
the
ball
has
less
chance
of
sliding
off
to
one
side
when
the
striking
surface
is
large
here
your
ball
coming
now
try
again
and
remember
what
i
have
said
about
the
swing
at
the
hip
forget
that
you
have
any
joints
at
all
and
just
let
the
right
side
of
you
swing
round
as
it
will
then
remsen
passed
on
to
the
next
man
and
joel
pegged
away
doing
better
and
better
as
he
soon
discovered
every
try
until
a
whistle
blew
from
the
middle
of
the
field
and
the
players
gathered
about
the
captains
on
the
line
joel
was
down
to
play
left
half
on
the
second
eleven
and
beside
him
at
right
was
wills
a
promising
lower
middle
boy
who
was
an
excellent
runner
but
who
so
far
had
failed
to
develop
any
aptitude
for
kicking
cloud
and
clausen
occupied
similar
positions
on
the
first
eleven
and
behind
them
stood
wesley
blair
the
best
that
hillton
academy
had
possessed
for
many
years
the
on
the
second
eleven
was
ned
post
a
veteran
player
but
as
erratic
as
a
mule
to
use
the
words
of
stephen
remsen
the
first
eleven
was
about
six
pounds
heavier
in
the
line
than
the
team
captained
by
louis
whipple
who
played
at
quarter
and
about
the
same
weight
behind
the
line
it
was
a
foregone
conclusion
that
the
first
would
win
but
whether
the
second
would
score
was
a
mooted
point
joel
felt
a
bit
nervous
now
that
he
was
in
his
first
game
of
consequence
but
forgot
all
about
it
a
moment
later
when
the
whistle
blew
and
greer
the
big
first
eleven
center
tore
through
their
line
for
six
yards
followed
by
wallace
clausen
with
the
ball
then
there
was
a
delay
for
the
right
half
when
he
tried
to
arise
found
that
his
ankle
was
strained
and
so
had
to
limp
off
the
ground
supported
by
greer
and
barnard
the
right
tackle
turner
a
new
player
went
on
and
the
ball
was
put
in
play
again
this
time
for
a
try
through
left
tackle
but
the
second
line
held
like
a
stone
wall
and
the
runner
was
forced
back
with
the
loss
of
a
yard
then
the
first
eleven
guards
fell
back
and
when
the
formation
hit
the
second
line
the
latter
broke
like
paper
and
the
first
streamed
through
for
a
dozen
yards
and
so
it
went
until
the
second
found
itself
only
a
few
yards
from
its
goal
line
there
with
the
backs
pressed
close
against
the
forwards
the
second
held
and
secured
the
ball
on
downs
only
to
lose
it
again
by
a
fumble
on
the
part
of
post
then
a
delayed
pass
gained
two
yards
for
the
first
and
a
mass
at
left
tackle
found
another
but
the
next
play
resulted
disastrously
for
when
the
ball
was
passed
back
there
was
no
one
to
take
it
and
the
quarter
was
borne
back
several
yards
before
his
own
astounded
players
could
come
to
his
assistance
that
about
settles
cloud
whispered
post
to
joel
as
they
hurried
up
to
take
the
new
position
that
was
his
signal
to
take
the
leather
through
right
end
and
he
was
fast
asleep
remsen
laying
for
him
but
the
advantage
to
the
second
was
of
short
duration
for
back
went
the
first
guards
again
and
down
came
the
ball
to
their
goal
line
with
short
remorseless
gains
and
presently
when
their
quarter
knelt
on
the
last
white
line
the
dreaded
happened
and
blair
lay
between
the
posts
with
half
the
second
eleven
on
top
of
him
but
with
the
ball
a
yard
over
the
line
an
easy
goal
resulted
and
just
as
the
teams
trotted
back
to
the
whistle
sounded
and
the
first
half
was
done
the
players
wrapped
themselves
warmly
in
blankets
and
squatted
in
the
protection
of
the
fence
and
were
immediately
surrounded
by
the
spectators
remsen
and
blair
talked
with
this
player
and
that
explaining
his
faults
or
saying
a
good
word
for
his
work
in
the
second
half
many
of
the
second
eleven
went
into
the
first
the
deposed
boys
retiring
to
the
and
several
substitutes
were
put
into
the
second
joel
went
back
to
full
ned
post
taking
clausen
place
at
right
half
on
the
first
eleven
and
turner
becoming
once
more
a
spectator
it
was
the
second
eleven
ball
and
joel
raced
down
the
field
after
the
as
far
as
their
line
and
there
caught
return
punt
very
neatly
ran
three
yards
under
poor
interference
and
was
then
seized
by
the
mighty
greer
and
hurled
to
earth
with
a
shock
that
completely
took
the
breath
out
of
him
for
a
moment
but
he
was
soon
on
his
feet
again
and
whipple
gave
him
an
encouraging
slap
as
he
trotted
back
to
his
place
the
next
play
was
an
ordinary
formation
with
the
ends
back
and
the
ball
passed
to
left
end
for
a
run
back
of
quarter
and
through
the
line
outside
of
guard
it
worked
like
a
charm
and
left
end
sped
through
with
joel
bracing
him
at
the
turn
and
the
left
half
going
ahead
four
yards
were
netted
meach
the
substitute
left
half
being
tackled
by
post
in
the
that
followed
joel
found
himself
sprawling
over
the
runner
with
cloud
sitting
astride
the
small
of
his
back
a
very
uncomfortable
part
of
the
body
with
which
to
support
a
weighty
opponent
but
he
would
not
have
minded
that
alone
but
when
cloud
arose
his
foot
came
into
violent
contact
with
joel
head
which
caused
that
youth
to
see
stars
and
left
a
small
cut
back
of
his
ear
that
was
an
accident
muttered
joel
as
he
picked
himself
up
and
eyed
cloud
but
the
latter
was
unconcernedly
moving
to
his
position
and
joel
gave
his
head
a
shake
or
two
and
resolved
to
forgive
and
forget
a
play
similar
to
the
last
was
next
tried
with
an
outlet
on
the
other
side
outside
tackle
but
it
resulted
in
a
loss
of
a
yard
and
at
the
next
down
the
ball
was
thrown
back
to
joel
who
made
a
poor
catch
and
followed
it
with
a
short
high
punt
to
the
opponent
forty
yards
your
head
cut
march
said
wills
as
they
took
up
the
new
position
joel
nodded
cloud
he
answered
briefly
punch
him
answered
wills
he
mad
because
he
made
such
a
bull
of
his
play
in
the
other
half
if
he
tries
tricks
with
me
if
he
does
let
him
alone
if
you
want
to
stay
on
the
team
said
joel
that
sort
of
thing
does
help
watch
your
chance
and
spoil
a
play
of
his
that
the
best
way
to
get
even
the
next
ten
minutes
were
spent
in
desperate
attack
on
the
part
of
the
first
and
an
equally
desperate
defense
by
the
second
eleven
twenty
yards
of
gain
for
the
former
was
the
result
and
the
half
was
nearly
up
on
a
first
down
blair
ran
back
and
joel
whispering
kick
to
himself
turned
and
raced
farther
back
from
the
line
then
the
ball
was
snapped
there
was
a
crossing
of
backs
and
suddenly
far
out
around
the
right
end
came
cloud
with
the
pigskin
tightly
clutched
guarded
by
post
and
the
left
end
it
was
an
unexpected
play
and
the
second
halfs
saw
it
too
late
meach
and
wills
were
shouldered
out
of
the
way
and
cloud
ran
free
from
his
interference
and
bore
down
on
joel
looking
very
big
and
ugly
it
was
cloud
opportunity
to
redeem
himself
and
with
only
a
green
between
him
and
the
goal
line
his
chances
looked
bright
indeed
but
he
was
reckoning
without
his
host
joel
started
gingerly
up
to
meet
him
the
field
was
streaming
down
on
cloud
heels
but
too
far
away
to
be
in
the
running
ten
yards
distant
from
joel
cloud
right
arm
stretched
out
to
ward
off
a
tackle
and
his
face
grew
ugly
keep
off
he
hissed
as
joel
prepared
for
a
tackle
but
joel
had
no
mind
for
keeping
off
that
cut
in
his
head
was
aching
like
everything
and
his
own
advice
to
wills
occurred
to
him
and
made
him
grin
cloud
swerved
sharply
but
he
was
too
heavy
to
be
a
good
dodger
and
with
a
leap
joel
was
on
him
tackling
hard
and
true
about
the
runner
hips
cloud
struggled
made
a
yard
another
then
came
to
earth
with
head
snugly
pillowed
on
his
shoulder
a
shout
arose
from
the
crowd
the
field
came
up
and
joel
scrambled
to
his
feet
cloud
his
face
red
with
chagrin
and
anger
leaped
to
his
feet
and
stepping
toward
joel
aimed
a
vicious
blow
at
his
face
the
latter
ducked
and
involuntarily
raised
his
fist
then
ere
greer
and
some
of
the
others
stepped
between
turned
and
walked
away
that
will
do
cloud
said
remsen
in
sharp
incisive
tones
you
may
leave
and
with
a
muttered
word
of
anger
cloud
strode
from
the
field
passing
through
the
silent
and
unsympathetic
throng
with
pale
face
and
black
looks
first
ball
down
here
cried
greer
and
play
went
on
but
joel
had
lost
his
taste
for
it
and
when
a
few
minutes
later
neither
side
having
scored
again
time
was
called
he
trotted
back
to
the
gymnasium
in
a
depressed
mood
you
did
great
work
exclaimed
outfield
west
as
he
joined
joel
on
the
river
path
that
settles
cloud
chances
remsen
was
laying
for
him
anyhow
you
know
and
then
that
remsen
hates
dirty
playing
worse
than
anything
they
say
i
sorry
it
happened
though
returned
joel
pshaw
do
you
be
afraid
of
cloud
he
all
bluster
i
not
afraid
of
him
but
i
sorry
he
lost
the
team
through
me
of
course
i
could
have
let
him
go
by
and
i
do
suppose
it
could
have
been
helped
but
i
wish
some
one
else
had
tackled
him
of
course
it
could
have
been
helped
responded
west
cheerfully
and
i
glad
it
could
my
is
cloud
mad
i
passed
him
a
minute
or
two
ago
ought
to
try
golf
bart
said
i
you
should
have
seen
the
look
he
gave
me
i
guess
it
was
rather
like
it
in
and
west
grinned
hugely
at
the
recollection
how
about
the
tournament
west
asked
joel
fine
there
are
twelve
entries
and
we
going
to
begin
at
nine
in
the
morning
i
did
the
fourth
hole
this
afternoon
in
two
and
the
eighth
in
three
no
one
has
ever
done
the
fourth
in
two
before
it
the
bogey
score
do
forget
that
you
have
promised
to
go
around
with
me
they
say
whipple
is
practicing
every
morning
over
in
turner
meadow
what
with
that
and
football
he
a
pretty
busy
lad
i
dare
say
do
forget
nine
day
after
and
outfield
west
waved
his
hand
gayly
and
swung
off
toward
hampton
house
while
joel
entered
the
gymnasium
and
was
soon
enjoying
the
luxury
of
a
shower
bath
and
listening
to
the
conversation
of
the
others
there
be
a
observed
warren
as
he
rubbed
himself
dry
with
a
big
towel
remsen
was
any
too
well
pleased
he
going
to
put
greer
on
the
scrub
that
where
you
might
as
well
be
answered
the
big
center
the
idea
of
playing
a
with
your
right
end
on
the
we
took
two
yards
just
the
same
replied
warren
we
gave
it
to
you
my
lad
because
we
knew
that
if
you
lost
on
such
a
fool
play
your
name
would
be
well
anything
but
thomas
warren
the
reply
to
this
sally
was
a
boot
launched
at
the
center
rush
for
tom
warren
middle
name
was
in
reality
saalfield
and
stumpy
was
a
cognomen
rather
too
descriptive
to
be
relished
by
the
greer
returned
the
missile
with
interest
and
the
fight
grew
warm
and
boots
and
footballs
and
filled
the
air
in
the
dining
hall
that
evening
interest
was
divided
between
the
golf
match
to
be
played
on
the
following
saturday
morning
and
the
football
game
with
the
westvale
grammar
school
in
the
afternoon
golf
had
fewer
admirers
than
had
the
other
sport
but
what
there
were
were
fully
as
enthusiastic
and
the
coming
tournament
was
discussed
until
joel
head
whirled
with
such
apparently
outlandish
terms
as
bogey
baffy
put
green
foozle
and
tee
whipple
blair
and
west
all
had
their
supporters
and
joel
learned
a
number
of
marvelous
facts
as
for
instance
that
whipple
had
driven
from
purgatory
to
the
hill
in
five
that
blair
was
putting
better
than
grimes
did
last
year
and
that
west
had
taken
four
to
get
out
of
sandy
all
of
which
was
undoubtedly
intensely
interesting
but
was
as
so
much
sanskrit
to
joel
and
he
walked
back
to
his
room
after
supper
with
a
greatly
increased
respect
for
the
game
of
golf
chapter
vii
a
letter
home
one
of
joel
letters
written
to
his
mother
at
about
this
time
contains
much
that
will
prove
of
interest
to
the
reader
who
has
followed
the
fortunes
of
that
youth
thus
far
it
supplied
a
certain
amount
of
information
appreciated
only
by
its
author
and
its
recipient
facts
regarding
woolen
stockings
items
about
the
manner
in
which
the
washing
was
done
a
short
statement
of
his
financial
condition
a
weak
but
very
natural
expression
of
but
such
i
will
omit
as
being
too
private
in
character
for
these
pages
i
do
think
you
need
worry
outfield
west
is
rather
idle
about
study
but
he
does
give
satan
much
of
a
show
for
he
about
the
busiest
fellow
i
know
in
school
he
usually
up
a
good
hour
before
breakfast
which
we
have
at
eight
and
puts
in
a
half
hour
practicing
golf
before
chapel
then
in
the
afternoon
he
at
it
again
when
the
weather
will
let
him
and
he
generally
spends
his
evenings
when
not
studying
in
mending
his
clubs
or
painting
balls
then
he
one
of
the
canvassers
for
the
class
crew
and
belongs
to
the
senior
debating
club
which
draws
its
members
from
the
two
upper
classes
and
president
of
the
golf
club
so
you
can
see
that
he
anything
but
idle
even
if
he
does
bother
much
about
lessons
he
naturally
a
very
bright
fellow
otherwise
he
could
get
along
with
his
classes
i
grow
to
like
him
better
every
day
he
such
a
manly
fellow
and
one
of
the
most
popular
in
school
rather
big
with
fine
broad
shoulders
and
awfully
he
has
hair
about
the
color
of
cousin
george
and
bright
blue
eyes
and
he
always
looks
as
though
he
had
just
got
out
of
the
only
stopped
of
course
to
put
his
clothes
on
i
guess
we
must
be
pretty
in
our
notions
we
maine
country
folks
because
so
many
of
my
pet
ideas
and
beliefs
have
been
changed
since
i
came
here
you
know
with
us
it
has
always
gone
without
dispute
that
rich
boys
are
mean
and
worthless
if
not
really
immoral
but
here
they
not
that
way
i
guess
we
never
had
much
chance
to
study
rich
people
up
our
way
mother
at
the
grammar
school
all
the
fellows
looked
down
on
wealthy
boys
but
we
never
had
any
of
them
around
the
richest
chap
was
gilbert
whose
father
was
a
lumberman
and
gilbert
used
to
wear
shoes
that
you
would
give
to
a
tramp
i
suppose
west
father
could
buy
gilbert
out
twenty
times
and
not
miss
the
money
outfield
is
it
a
queer
name
spends
a
lot
of
money
but
not
foolishly
i
mean
he
has
no
bad
habits
like
a
few
of
the
fellows
i
hope
you
will
meet
him
some
time
perhaps
i
could
have
him
up
to
stay
a
few
days
with
me
next
summer
he
be
glad
to
come
no
my
roommate
sproule
does
improve
any
on
acquaintance
but
got
so
i
do
mind
him
much
i
do
think
he
really
as
mean
as
he
makes
you
believe
he
having
hard
work
with
his
studies
nowadays
and
has
less
time
to
find
fault
with
things
you
ask
how
i
spend
my
time
dear
little
mother
you
do
know
what
life
in
a
big
boarding
school
like
hillton
is
why
i
have
an
idle
moment
from
one
day
end
to
the
next
here
a
sample
this
morning
i
got
up
just
in
time
for
chapel
i
getting
to
be
a
terrible
chap
for
sleeping
late
and
then
had
breakfast
by
that
time
it
was
quarter
to
nine
at
nine
i
went
to
my
mathematics
then
came
latin
then
english
at
twelve
i
reported
on
the
green
and
practiced
signals
with
the
second
squad
until
half
past
then
came
lunch
after
lunch
i
scurried
up
to
my
room
and
dug
up
on
chemistry
which
was
at
then
came
greek
at
half
past
two
then
i
had
an
hour
of
loafing
that
is
i
should
have
had
it
but
i
was
afraid
of
my
history
so
put
in
part
of
the
time
studying
that
at
a
little
before
four
i
hurried
over
to
the
gymnasium
got
into
football
togs
and
reached
the
campus
in
time
to
be
in
time
we
had
a
stiff
hour
practice
with
the
ball
and
learned
two
new
formations
when
i
got
back
to
the
it
was
a
quarter
past
five
i
had
my
bath
rubbed
down
did
two
miles
on
the
track
exercised
with
the
weights
and
got
to
supper
ten
minutes
late
west
came
over
to
the
room
with
me
and
stayed
until
i
put
him
out
which
was
hard
work
because
he
heavier
than
i
am
and
i
got
my
books
out
and
studied
until
half
an
hour
ago
it
is
now
just
ten
and
as
soon
as
i
finish
this
i
shall
tumble
into
bed
and
sleep
like
a
top
i
ca
answer
your
question
about
remsen
because
i
do
not
know
him
well
enough
to
ask
about
his
home
or
relatives
but
his
first
name
is
stephen
perhaps
he
is
a
relative
of
the
remsens
you
mention
some
day
i
find
out
anyhow
he
the
grandest
kind
of
a
fellow
i
suppose
he
about
thirty
he
has
plenty
of
money
west
says
and
is
a
lawyer
by
profession
he
has
coached
hillton
for

is
played
here

much
for

many
many
smart
fellows
here

i
think
i
have
a
ghost
of

doing
my
best
and
after

that
are
worth
getting

do
believe

shall
be
satisfied
with
any
other
west

i
cheeky
to
even
expect
a
show

very
nice
even
his
real
name

durkee
and
he
is
professor

he
is
not
popular
among
the
fellows
but
is
an
awfully
good
instructor
the
principal
professor
wheeler

called
but
it
sounds
worse
than
it

every
one
likes
him
he
is
not
at
all
old
and
talks
to
the
fellows
about
football

and
in
this
way
it
will
be
sure
to
fit
right
thank
father
for
me
please
your
loving
son
joel
the
opportunity
to
inquire
regarding
stephen
remsen
family
connections
presented
itself
to
joel
on
the
day
preceding
the
golf
tournament
and
the
football
game
with
westvale
on
account
of
the
latter
there
had
been
only
a
half
hour
of
light
practice
for
the
two
squads
and
joel
at
half
past
four
had
gone
to
his
room
to
study
but
when
it
came
time
to
puzzle
out
some
problems
in
geometry
joel
found
that
his
paper
was
used
up
and
rather
than
borrow
of
his
neighbors
he
pulled
on
his
cap
and
started
for
the
village
store
october
had
brought
warm
weather
and
this
afternoon
as
he
went
along
the
road
that
leads
to
the
post
office
he
found
himself
dawdling
over
the
dusty
grasses
and
bushes
recognizing
old
friends
and
making
new
ones
as
folks
will
when
the
sun
is
warm
and
the
birds
sing
beside
the
way
he
watched
a
tiny
chipmunk
scamper
along
the
top
of
the
stone
wall
and
disappear
in
the
branches
of
a
maple
looked
upward
and
saw
a
mass
of
fluffy
white
clouds
going
northward
and
thought
wistfully
of
spring
and
the
delights
it
promised
here
in
the
hudson
valley
the
had
passed
its
prime
though
here
and
there
a
yellow
torch
yet
lighted
the
shadowed
tangles
of
shrub
and
vine
beneath
the
wall
but
the
asters
still
bloomed
on
and
it
was
while
bending
over
a
clump
of
them
that
joel
heard
the
whir
of
wheels
on
the
smooth
road
and
turned
to
see
a
bicyclist
speeding
toward
him
from
the
direction
of
the
academy
when
the
rider
drew
near
joel
recognized
stephen
remsen
and
he
withdrew
toward
the
wall
that
the
coach
might
have
the
benefit
of
the
level
footpath
and
avoid
the
ruts
but
instead
of
speeding
by
remsen
slowed
down
a
few
feet
distant
and
jumped
from
his
wheel
hello
march
was
his
greeting
as
he
came
up
to
that
youth
are
you
studying
botany
joel
explained
that
he
had
been
only
trying
to
identify
the
aster
a
spray
of
which
he
had
broken
off
and
still
held
in
his
hand
perhaps
i
can
tell
you
what
it
is
answered
remsen
as
he
took
it
yes
it
the
is
it
common
where
you
live
i
never
noticed
it
answered
joel
we
have
lots
of
the
and
in
maine
and
some
of
the
white
asters
it
must
be
very
lovely
about
here
in
spring
yes
it
is
spring
is
beautiful
here
as
it
is
everywhere
the
valley
of
the
hudson
is
especially
rich
in
flora
i
believe
i
used
to
be
very
fond
of
the
woods
on
mount
adam
when
i
was
a
boy
here
at
hillton
and
knew
every
tree
in
it
they
were
walking
on
toward
the
village
remsen
rolling
his
bicycle
beside
him
it
a
long
while
since
then
i
suppose
sir
queried
joel
i
graduated
from
hillton
ten
years
ago
this
coming
june
i
rowed
stroke
in
the
boat
that
spring
and
we
won
from
eustace
by
an
eighth
of
a
mile
and
we
nearly
burned
old
masters
down
to
the
ground
with
our
roman
candles
and
sky
rockets
you
room
there
do
you
march
yes
sir
number
that
was
billy
mathews
room
that
year
some
time
if
you
look
under
the
carpet
you
find
a
depression
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
where
billy
made
a
bonfire
one
night
and
offered
up
in
sacrifice
all
his
it
took
half
an
hour
to
put
that
fire
out
remsen
was
smiling
reminiscently
but
what
did
he
burn
his
books
for
sir
was
it
the
end
of
the
year
no
but
billy
had
been
expelled
that
day
and
was
celebrating
the
fact
he
was
a
nice
old
chap
was
billy
mathews
he
president
of
a
western
railroad
now
joel
laughed
that
bonfire
must
have
made
as
much
commotion
as
some
of
the
explosions
in
number
mr
remsen
hello
are
my
efforts
in
pursuit
of
science
still
remembered
here
who
told
you
about
that
march
cowles
she
said
you
were
forever
doing
something
terrible
but
that
you
were
such
a
boy
remsen
laughed
heartily
as
he
replied
well
do
pattern
your
conduct
on
mine
or
mathews
march
we
were
a
very
lot
i
fear
but
i
do
believe
our
pranks
did
much
harm
in
those
days
football
was
as
popular
as
it
is
at
hillton
and
fellows
could
work
off
their
surplus
animal
spirits
thumping
a
pigskin
as
they
can
now
football
is
a
great
benefactor
in
that
way
march
it
has
done
away
with
hazing
and
street
brawls
and
gate
stealing
and
lots
of
other
deviltry
by
the
way
how
are
you
getting
on
with
the
game
i
think
i
getting
the
hang
of
it
sir
i
having
a
hard
time
with
drop
kicking
but
i
guess
i
learn
after
a
while
i
sure
you
will
i
going
to
have
blair
give
you
a
bit
of
coaching
in
it
next
week
he
have
more
time
then
after
he
has
finished
with
this
golf
business
do
get
discouraged
peg
away
it
worth
the
work
march
and
you
have
the
making
of
a
good
back
as
soon
as
you
learn
how
to
kick
a
goal
and
run
a
little
faster
and
whenever
you
puzzled
about
anything
come
to
me
and
we
work
it
out
together
will
you
yes
sir
thank
you
that
right
well
here
where
i
turn
off
have
you
time
to
come
and
pay
me
a
visit
not
i
afraid
remsen
i
just
going
to
the
post
office
for
some
paper
and
well
come
and
see
me
some
time
i
pretty
nearly
always
at
home
in
the
evenings
and
will
be
very
glad
to
see
you
and
bring
your
friend
west
with
you
that
my
headquarters
down
there
the
yellow
house
hutchins
if
you
cut
across
the
field
here
it
will
save
you
quite
a
distance
and
get
to
bed
early
march
if
you
can
there
nothing
like
a
good
sleep
before
a
game
answered
joel
then
remsen
one
minute
please
sir
he
called
are
you
any
relation
to
the
remsens
that
live
near
clairmont
in
maine
sir
why
i
should
wonder
answered
remsen
with
a
smile
i
think
heard
my
father
speak
of
relatives
in
maine
but
i
do
recollect
where
why
do
you
ask
my
mother
wrote
me
to
find
out
she
very
much
interested
in
relatives
remsen
and
so
i
thought
i
ask
and
let
her
know
you
did
mind
my
asking
you
did
you
certainly
not
tell
your
mother
march
that
i
hope
those
remsens
are
some
of
my
folks
because
i
should
like
to
be
related
to
her
friends
and
say
march
when
you
writing
to
your
mother
about
me
you
say
anything
about
those
explosions
need
you
i
do
think
it
will
be
necessary
sir
laughed
joel
very
well
then
just
mention
me
as
a
dignified
and
reverend
and
we
keep
the
rest
a
secret
between
us
chapter
viii
the
golf
tournament
it
was
saturday
afternoon
the
day
was
bright
and
sunny
and
in
the
shelter
of
the
grand
stand
on
the
campus
where
the
little
east
wind
could
not
rustle
it
was
comfortably
warm
the
grass
still
held
much
of
its
summer
verdancy
and
the
sky
overhead
was
as
deeply
blue
as
on
the
mildest
spring
day
after
a
week
of
dull
or
stormy
weather
yesterday
and
with
their
fair
skies
were
as
welcome
as
flowers
in
may
and
gladness
and
were
in
the
very
air
on
the
gridiron
westvale
grammar
school
and
hillton
academy
were
trying
conclusions
on
the
grand
stand
all
hillton
academy
and
village
was
assembled
and
here
and
there
a
bright
dress
or
wrap
indicated
the
presence
of
a
mother
or
sister
in
the
throng
the
westvale
team
had
arrived
accompanied
by
a
coterie
of
enthusiastic
supporters
armed
with
tin
horns
banners
and
mighty
voices
which
with
small
hopes
of
winning
on
the
field
were
resolved
to
accomplish
a
notable
victory
of
sound
on
the
with
a
dozen
other
substitutes
whose
greatest
desire
was
to
be
taken
on
the
first
eleven
sat
joel
outfield
west
was
sprawled
beside
him
with
his
caddie
bag
clutched
to
his
breast
and
the
two
boys
were
discussing
the
game
west
had
arrived
upon
the
scene
but
a
moment
before
we
beat
them
by
about
a
dozen
points
i
guess
joel
was
prophesying
they
say
the
score
was
twenty
to
nothing
last
year
but
remsen
declares
the
first
is
nearly
as
far
advanced
as
it
was
this
time
last
season
just
hear
the
racket
those
fellows
are
making
you
ought
to
have
seen
blair
kick
down
the
field
a
while
ago
i
thought
the
ball
never
would
come
down
and
i
guess
westvale
thought
so
too
their
nearly
killed
himself
running
backward
and
finally
caught
it
on
their
line
and
had
it
down
there
then
greer
walked
through
lugging
andrews
for
a
after
westvale
had
tried
three
times
to
move
the
ball
there
the
whistle
half
up
how
is
the
golf
getting
along
somers
and
whipple
were
at
look
off
when
i
came
away
i
asked
billy
jones
to
come
over
and
call
me
when
they
got
to
the
hill
i
think
whipple
will
win
by
a
couple
of
strokes
somers
is
too
nervous
i
wish
they
hurry
up
we
not
get
through
the
last
round
before
dark
if
they
do
finish
soon
you
go
round
with
me
wo
you
if
the
game
over
they
playing
halves
you
know
so
i
guess
it
will
be
i
hope
blair
will
let
me
on
this
half
have
you
seen
cloud
yes
he
over
on
the
seats
who
has
his
place
ned
post
and
clausen
playing
at
right
i
glad
that
blair
is
doing
such
good
work
i
think
he
was
rather
cut
up
about
getting
beaten
this
morning
yes
was
that
hard
luck
to
think
of
his
being
downed
by
a
cub
of
a
junior
though
that
same
junior
is
going
to
be
a
fine
player
some
day
he
drives
just
grand
he
had
too
much
handicap
he
did
remsen
know
anything
about
him
and
allowed
him
ten
here
they
come
again
the
two
elevens
were
trotting
out
on
the
field
once
more
and
joel
stood
up
in
the
hope
that
blair
might
see
him
and
decide
to
take
him
on
but
joel
was
doomed
to
disappointment
for
the
second
half
of
the
game
began
with
practically
the
same
the
score
stood
six
to
nothing
in
favor
of
hillton
the
playing
had
been
decidedly
ragged
on
both
sides
and
remsen
as
he
left
the
team
after
administering
a
severe
lecture
walked
past
with
a
slight
frown
on
his
face
well
i
guess
i
go
over
and
see
if
i
can
hurry
those
chumps
up
some
west
swung
his
bag
over
his
shoulder
and
turned
away
when
the
game
done
hurry
over
march
you
find
us
somewhere
on
the
course
joel
nodded
and
west
sauntered
away
toward
the
links
the
second
half
of
the
game
was
similar
to
the
first
save
in
that
remsen
scolding
had
accomplished
an
awakening
and
the
first
put
more
snap
into
its
playing
six
more
points
were
scored
from
a
by
the
hillton
right
end
after
a
run
followed
by
a
difficult
goal
by
blair
but
the
westvale
rooters
kept
up
their
cheering
bravely
to
the
end
and
took
defeat
with
smiling
faces
and
upraised
voices
and
long
after
the
coach
containing
them
had
passed
from
sight
their
cheers
could
still
be
heard
in
the
distance
toward
the
station
the
bulk
of
the
spectators
turned
at
the
conclusion
of
the
match
toward
the
links
and
joel
followed
in
his
football
togs
at
home
hole
he
found
whipple
and
west
preparing
for
the
deciding
round
of
the
tournament
and
the
latter
greeted
him
with
a
shout
and
put
his
clubs
into
his
keeping
then
whipple
went
to
the
tee
and
led
off
with
a
long
drive
for
the
first
hole
and
the
round
began
west
followed
with
a
shorter
shot
and
the
march
was
taken
up
the
links
at
hilton
consists
of
nine
holes
five
out
and
four
in
the
entire
length
of
the
course
is
a
trifle
over
one
and
a
half
mile
and
although
the
land
is
upland
meadow
and
given
to
growing
long
grass
yet
the
course
is
generally
conceded
to
be
excellent
the
holes
are
short
allowing
the
round
to
be
accomplished
by
a
capable
player
in
strokes
the
course
has
thirteen
bunkers
of
varying
sizes
besides
two
water
hazards
at
the
inlet
and
outlet
of
the
lake
the
lake
itself
is
spoiled
as
a
hazard
by
the
thick
grove
of
trees
on
the
side
nearest
the
academy
sometimes
a
poor
drive
lands
a
ball
in
that
same
grove
and
there
is
much
trial
and
tribulation
ere
the
player
has
succeeded
in
dislodging
it
from
the
underbrush
while
generally
level
the
course
is
diversified
by
slight
elevations
upon
which
are
the
putting
greens
their
red
and
white
flags
visible
from
all
parts
of
the
links
as
has
been
said
the
holes
are
short
the
longest
lake
hole
being
four
hundred
and
yards
and
the
shortest
the
first
but
one
hundred
and
outfield
west
once
spent
the
better
part
of
two
weeks
at
great
cost
to
his
class
standing
in
making
a
plan
of
the
links
and
while
it
is
not
warranted
accurate
as
to
distances
it
is
reproduced
here
with
his
permission
as
giving
a
clearer
idea
of
the
ground
than
any
verbal
description
play
had
begun
this
morning
at
nine
and
by
noon
only
somers
whipple
and
west
had
been
left
in
the
match
blair
had
encountered
defeat
most
unexpectedly
at
the
hands
of
greene
a
junior
of
whose
prowess
but
little
had
been
known
by
the
handicapper
for
although
blair
had
done
the
round
in
three
strokes
less
than
his
gross
score
the
latter
allowance
of
six
strokes
had
placed
him
an
easy
winner
but
blair
had
been
avenged
later
by
west
who
had
defeated
the
youngster
by
three
strokes
in
the
net
in
the
afternoon
somers
and
whipple
had
met
and
as
west
had
predicted
the
latter
won
by
two
strokes
and
now
west
and
whipple
both
excellent
players
and
sworn
enemies
of
the
links
were
fighting
it
out
and
on
this
round
depended
the
possession
of
the
title
of
champion
and
the
ownership
for
one
year
of
the
handicap
cup
a
modest
but
highly
prized
pewter
tankard
medal
play
rules
governed
and
the
scoring
was
by
strokes
illustration
plan
of
hilton
academy
golf
links
whipple
reached
the
first
green
in
one
stroke
but
used
two
more
to
west
took
two
short
drives
to
reach
a
lie
from
which
he
dropped
his
ball
into
the
hole
in
one
try
and
the
honors
were
even
the
next
hole
was
forty
yards
longer
and
was
played
either
in
two
short
drives
or
one
long
drive
and
an
approach
shot
it
contained
two
hazards
track
bunker
and
high
bunker
the
latter
alone
being
formidable
whipple
led
off
with
a
long
shot
that
went
soaring
up
against
the
blue
and
then
settled
down
as
gently
as
a
bird
just
a
few
yards
in
front
of
high
bunker
he
had
reversed
his
play
of
the
last
hole
and
was
now
relying
on
his
approach
shot
for
position
west
played
a
rather
short
drive
off
an
iron
which
left
his
ball
midway
between
the
two
bunkers
next
stroke
took
him
neatly
out
of
danger
and
on
to
the
putting
green
but
west
had
fared
not
so
well
there
was
a
great
deal
of
noise
from
the
younger
boys
who
were
looking
on
much
discussion
of
the
methods
of
play
and
much
loud
boasting
of
what
some
one
else
would
have
done
under
existing
circumstances
west
glanced
up
once
and
glared
at
one
offending
junior
and
an
admonitory
was
heard
but
he
was
plainly
disturbed
and
when
the
little
white
sphere
made
its
flight
it
went
sadly
aglee
and
dropped
to
earth
far
to
the
right
of
the
green
and
where
rough
and
cuppy
ground
made
exact
putting
impossible
professor
beck
promptly
laid
down
a
command
of
absolute
silence
during
shots
and
some
of
the
smaller
youths
left
the
course
in
favor
of
another
portion
of
the
campus
where
a
right
to
make
all
the
noise
he
likes
could
not
be
disputed
but
the
harm
was
done
and
when
play
for
the
third
hole
began
the
score
was
whipple
west
even
to
one
of
such
intense
ignorance
of
the
science
of
golf
as
joel
march
there
was
a
perceptible
difference
in
the
style
of
the
two
competitors
outfield
west
was
a
great
stickler
for
form
and
imitated
the
full
andrews
swing
to
the
best
of
his
ability
in
addressing
the
ball
he
stood
as
squarely
to
it
as
was
possible
without
the
use
of
a
measuring
tape
and
drove
off
the
right
leg
as
the
expression
is
despite
an
almost
exaggerated
adherence
to
nicety
of
style
west
play
had
an
ease
and
grace
much
envied
by
other
golf
disciples
in
the
school
and
his
shots
were
nearly
always
successful
whipple
manner
of
driving
was
very
different
from
his
opponent
his
swing
was
short
and
often
stopped
too
soon
his
stance
was
rather
awkward
after
west
and
even
his
hold
on
the
club
was
not
according
to
established
precedent
yet
notwithstanding
all
this
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
whipple
drives
had
a
way
of
carrying
straight
and
far
and
landing
well
joel
followed
the
play
with
much
interest
if
small
appreciation
of
its
intricacies
and
carried
west
bag
and
hoped
all
the
time
that
that
youth
would
win
knowing
how
greatly
he
had
set
his
heart
upon
so
doing
there
is
no
bunker
between
second
and
third
holes
but
the
brook
which
supplies
the
lake
runs
across
the
course
and
is
about
six
yards
wide
from
bank
to
bank
but
it
has
no
terrors
for
a
long
drive
and
both
the
players
went
safely
over
and
won
academy
hole
in
three
strokes
west
still
held
the
odd
two
long
strokes
carried
whipple
a
scant
distance
from
railroad
bunker
which
fronts
ditch
hole
a
dangerous
lie
since
railroad
bunker
is
high
and
the
putting
green
is
on
an
elevation
almost
meriting
the
title
of
hill
directly
back
of
it
but
if
whipple
erred
in
judgment
or
skill
west
found
himself
in
even
a
sorrier
plight
when
two
more
strokes
had
been
laid
to
his
score
his
first
drive
with
a
brassie
had
fallen
rather
short
and
for
the
second
he
had
chosen
an
iron
the
ball
sailed
off
on
a
long
flight
that
brought
words
of
delight
from
the
spectators
but
which
caused
joel
to
look
glum
and
west
to
grind
the
turf
under
his
heel
in
anger
for
like
a
thing
possessed
that
ball
fell
straight
into
the
very
middle
of
the
bunker
and
when
it
was
found
lay
up
to
its
middle
in
gravel
west
groaned
as
he
lifted
the
ball
replaced
it
loosely
in
its
cup
and
carefully
selected
a
club
whipple
meanwhile
cleared
the
bunker
in
the
best
of
style
and
landed
on
the
green
in
a
good
position
to
hole
out
in
two
shots
great
gobble
muttered
west
as
he
swung
his
club
and
fixed
his
eye
on
a
point
an
inch
and
a
half
back
of
the
imbedded
ball
if
i
do
get
this
out
of
here
on
this
shot
i
a
gone
goose
march
grinned
sympathetically
but
anxiously
and
the
onlookers
held
their
breath
then
back
went
the
club
there
was
a
scattering
of
sand
and
gravel
and
the
ball
dropped
dead
on
the
green
four
yards
from
the
hole
excellent
shouted
professor
beck
and
joel
jumped
in
the
air
from
sheer
delight
good
for
you
out
yelled
dave
somers
and
the
rest
of
the
watchers
echoed
the
sentiment
in
various
ways
even
those
who
desired
to
see
whipple
triumphant
yielding
their
meed
of
praise
for
the
performance
and
i
guess
out
said
whipple
ruefully
you
might
as
well
take
the
cup
but
outfield
west
only
smiled
silently
in
response
and
followed
his
ball
with
businesslike
attention
to
the
game
whipple
was
weak
on
putting
and
his
first
stroke
with
an
iron
failed
to
carry
his
ball
to
the
hole
west
on
the
contrary
was
a
sure
player
on
the
green
and
now
with
his
ball
but
four
yards
from
the
hole
he
had
just
the
opportunity
he
desired
to
better
his
score
the
green
was
level
and
clean
and
west
selected
a
small
iron
putter
and
addressed
the
ball
with
all
the
attention
to
form
that
the
oldest
andrews
veteran
might
desire
playing
on
the
principle
that
it
is
better
to
go
too
far
than
not
far
enough
since
the
hole
is
larger
than
the
ball
west
gave
a
long
stroke
and
the
disappeared
from
view
whipple
holed
out
on
his
next
try
adopting
a
wooden
putter
this
time
and
the
score
stood
fifteen
strokes
each
the
honor
was
west
and
he
led
off
for
end
hole
with
a
beautiful
brassie
drive
that
cleared
the
first
two
bunkers
with
room
to
spare
whipple
for
the
first
time
in
the
round
drove
poorly
toeing
his
ball
badly
and
dropping
it
almost
off
of
the
course
and
just
short
of
the
second
bunker
west
second
drive
was
a
loft
over
halfway
bunker
that
fell
fairly
on
the
green
and
rolled
within
ten
feet
of
the
hole
from
there
on
the
next
shot
he
holed
out
very
neatly
in
eighteen
whipple
meanwhile
had
redeemed
himself
with
a
high
lofting
stroke
that
carried
past
the
threatening
dangers
of
masters
bunker
and
back
on
to
the
course
within
a
few
yards
of
west
lie
but
again
skill
on
the
putting
green
was
wanting
and
he
required
two
strokes
to
make
the
hole
once
more
the
honor
was
west
and
that
youth
turned
toward
home
with
a
short
and
high
stroke
the
subsequent
hole
left
the
score
the
like
at
and
the
seventh
gave
whipple
west
but
here
where
west
takes
the
lead
confided
that
young
gentleman
to
joel
as
they
walked
to
the
teeing
ground
from
here
to
lake
hole
is
four
hundred
and
yards
and
i
going
to
do
it
in
three
shots
on
to
the
green
you
watch
four
hundred
and
yards
is
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
an
older
player
but
to
a
lad
of
seventeen
it
is
a
creditable
distance
to
do
in
three
drives
yet
that
is
what
west
did
it
in
and
strange
to
relate
and
greatly
to
that
young
gentleman
surprise
whipple
duplicated
the
performance
and
amid
the
excited
whispers
of
the
onlookers
the
two
youths
holed
out
on
their
next
strokes
and
the
score
still
gave
the
odd
to
west
to
i
did
think
he
could
do
it
whispered
west
to
joel
and
that
makes
it
look
bad
for
your
uncle
out
but
never
mind
my
lad
there
still
rocky
bunker
ahead
of
us
and
west
did
not
complete
his
remark
but
his
face
took
on
a
very
determined
look
as
he
teed
his
ball
the
last
hole
was
in
sight
and
victory
hovered
overhead
now
the
distance
from
lake
hole
to
the
home
hole
is
but
a
few
yards
over
three
hundred
and
it
can
be
accomplished
comfortably
in
two
long
brassie
drives
midway
lies
the
hill
a
small
elevation
rising
from
about
the
middle
of
the
course
to
the
river
bluff
and
there
falling
off
sheer
to
the
beach
below
it
is
perhaps
thirty
yards
across
and
if
the
ball
reaches
it
safely
it
forms
an
excellent
place
from
which
to
make
the
second
drive
so
both
boys
tried
for
the
hill
whipple
landed
at
the
foot
of
it
while
west
came
plump
upon
the
side
some
five
yards
from
the
summit
and
his
next
drive
took
him
cleanly
over
rocky
bunker
and
to
the
right
of
the
home
green
but
whipple
summoned
discretion
to
his
aid
and
instead
of
trying
to
make
the
green
on
the
next
drive
played
short
and
landed
far
to
the
right
of
the
bunker
this
necessitated
a
short
approach
and
by
the
time
he
had
gained
the
green
and
was
made
within
holing
distance
of
the
flag
the
score
was
once
more
even
and
the
end
was
in
sight
and
now
the
watchers
moved
about
restlessly
and
joel
found
his
heart
in
his
throat
but
west
gripped
his
wooden
putter
firmly
and
studied
the
situation
it
was
quite
possible
for
a
skillful
player
to
hole
out
on
the
next
stroke
from
whipple
lie
west
on
the
contrary
was
too
far
distant
to
possess
more
than
one
chance
in
ten
of
winning
the
hole
in
one
play
whether
to
take
that
one
chance
or
to
use
his
next
play
in
bettering
his
lie
was
the
question
whipple
west
knew
was
weak
on
putting
but
it
is
ever
risky
to
rely
on
your
opponent
weakness
while
west
pondered
whipple
studied
the
lay
of
the
green
with
eyes
that
strove
to
show
no
triumph
and
the
little
throng
kept
silence
save
for
an
occasional
nervous
whisper
then
west
leaned
down
and
cleared
a
pebble
from
before
his
ball
it
was
the
veriest
atom
of
a
pebble
that
ever
showed
on
a
putting
green
but
west
was
willing
to
take
no
chances
beyond
those
that
already
confronted
him
his
mind
was
made
up
gripping
his
iron
putter
firmly
rather
low
on
the
shaft
and
bending
far
over
west
slowly
cautiously
swung
the
club
above
the
gutty
glancing
once
and
only
once
as
he
did
so
at
the
distant
goal
then
there
was
a
pause
whipple
no
longer
studied
his
own
play
his
eyes
were
on
that
other
sphere
that
nestled
there
so
innocently
against
the
grass
joel
leaned
breathlessly
forward
professor
beck
muttered
under
his
breath
and
then
cried
s
sh
to
himself
in
an
angry
whisper
and
then
west
club
swung
back
gently
easily
paused
an
instant
and
forward
sped
the
ball
on
and
on
slower
slower
but
straight
as
an
arrow
and
then
presto
it
was
gone
from
sight
a
moment
of
silence
followed
ere
the
applause
broke
out
and
in
that
moment
professor
beck
announced
the
odd
to
whipple
to
then
the
group
became
silent
again
whipple
addressed
his
ball
it
was
yet
possible
to
tie
the
score
his
face
was
pale
and
for
the
first
time
during
the
tournament
he
felt
nervous
a
better
player
could
scarce
have
missed
the
hole
from
whipple
lie
but
for
once
that
youth
nerve
forsook
him
and
he
hit
too
short
the
ball
stopped
a
foot
from
the
hole
the
game
was
decided
professor
beck
again
announced
the
score
the
two
more
to
whipple
to
again
whipple
addressed
his
ball
and
this
time
but
too
late
to
win
the
victory
the
tiny
sphere
dropped
neatly
into
the
hole
and
the
throng
broke
silence
and
as
west
and
whipple
victor
and
vanquished
shook
hands
over
the
home
hole
professor
beck
announced
to
west
wins
the
cup
chapter
ix
an
evening
call
the
last
week
of
october
brought
chilling
winds
and
flying
clouds
life
at
hillton
academy
had
gone
on
serenely
since
west
victory
on
the
links
the
little
pewter
tankard
reposed
proudly
upon
his
mantel
beside
a
bottle
of
and
bore
his
name
as
the
third
winner
of
the
trophy
but
west
had
laid
aside
his
clubs
save
for
an
occasional
hour
at
noon
and
abiding
by
his
promise
to
joel
he
had
taken
up
his
books
again
with
much
resolution
if
little
ardor
hillton
had
met
and
defeated
two
more
football
teams
and
the
first
eleven
was
growing
gradually
stronger
remsen
was
seen
to
smile
now
quite
frequently
during
practice
and
there
was
a
general
air
of
prosperity
about
the
gridiron
the
first
had
gone
to
its
training
table
at
mother
burke
in
the
village
and
the
second
ate
its
meals
in
the
center
of
the
school
dining
hall
with
an
illy
concealed
sense
of
and
the
grinds
sneered
at
its
appetites
and
the
obscure
juniors
admired
reverently
from
afar
joel
had
attended
both
recitations
and
practice
with
exemplary
and
impartial
regularity
and
as
a
result
his
class
standing
was
growing
better
and
better
on
one
hand
and
on
the
other
his
muscles
were
becoming
stronger
his
flesh
firmer
and
his
brain
clearer
the
friendship
between
him
and
outfield
west
had
ripened
steadily
until
now
they
were
scarcely
separable
and
that
they
might
be
more
together
west
had
lately
made
a
proposition
that
fellow
sproule
is
a
regular
cad
joel
and
i
tell
you
what
do
after
christmas
you
move
over
to
hampton
and
room
with
me
you
have
to
make
an
application
before
recess
you
know
what
do
you
say
i
should
like
to
first
rate
but
i
ca
pay
the
rent
there
joel
had
objected
then
pay
the
same
as
you
paying
for
your
den
in
masters
replied
west
you
see
joel
i
have
to
pay
the
rent
for
number
hampton
anyhow
and
it
wo
make
any
difference
whether
i
have
another
fellow
in
with
me
or
not
only
if
you
pay
as
much
of
my
rent
as
you
paying
now
why
that
will
make
it
so
much
cheaper
for
me
do
you
see
yes
but
if
i
use
half
the
room
i
ought
to
pay
half
the
rent
and
to
this
joel
stood
firm
until
west
constant
entreaties
led
to
a
compromise
west
was
to
put
the
matter
before
his
father
and
joel
before
his
if
their
parents
sanctioned
it
joel
was
to
apply
for
the
change
of
abode
as
yet
the
matter
was
still
in
abeyance
richard
sproule
as
west
had
suggested
rather
more
forcibly
than
politely
was
becoming
more
and
more
objectionable
and
joel
was
not
a
bit
grieved
at
the
prospect
of
leaving
him
of
late
intercourse
between
the
roommates
had
become
reduced
to
rare
monosyllables
this
was
the
outcome
of
a
refusal
on
joel
part
to
give
a
portion
of
his
precious
study
time
to
helping
sproule
with
his
lessons
once
or
twice
joel
had
consented
to
assist
his
roommate
and
had
done
so
to
the
detriment
of
his
own
affairs
but
the
result
to
both
had
proved
so
unsatisfactory
that
joel
had
stoutly
refused
the
next
request
thereupon
sproule
had
considered
himself
deeply
aggrieved
and
usually
spent
the
time
when
joel
was
present
in
sulking
bartlett
cloud
since
his
encounter
with
joel
on
the
field
the
afternoon
that
he
was
put
off
the
team
had
had
nothing
to
say
to
him
though
his
looks
when
they
met
were
always
dark
and
threatening
but
in
a
school
as
large
as
hillton
there
is
plenty
of
room
to
avoid
an
objectionable
acquaintance
so
long
as
you
are
not
under
the
same
roof
with
him
and
consequently
cloud
and
joel
seldom
met
the
latter
constantly
regretted
having
made
an
enemy
of
the
other
but
beyond
this
regret
his
consideration
of
cloud
seldom
went
so
far
joel
had
not
found
an
opportunity
to
accept
the
invitation
that
remsen
had
extended
to
him
though
that
invitation
had
since
been
once
or
twice
repeated
but
west
and
he
had
made
arrangement
to
visit
remsen
at
his
room
and
had
obtained
permission
from
professor
wheeler
to
do
so
the
two
boys
met
at
the
gymnasium
after
supper
was
over
and
took
their
way
toward
the
village
west
had
armed
himself
with
a
formidable
stick
in
the
hope
loudly
expressed
at
intervals
that
they
would
be
set
upon
by
tramps
but
remsen
lodgings
were
reached
without
adventure
and
the
lads
were
straightway
admitted
to
a
cosey
study
wherein
before
an
open
fire
sat
remsen
and
a
guest
after
a
cordial
welcome
from
remsen
the
guest
was
introduced
as
albert
digbee
yes
we
know
each
other
said
west
as
he
shook
hands
we
both
room
in
hampton
but
digbee
a
grind
you
know
and
does
care
to
waste
his
time
on
us
idlers
digbee
smiled
it
is
inclination
west
i
do
have
the
time
and
so
do
attempt
to
keep
up
with
you
fellows
he
shook
joel
hand
i
glad
to
meet
you
i
heard
of
you
before
then
the
quartet
drew
chairs
up
to
the
blaze
and
as
remsen
talked
joel
examined
his
new
acquaintance
digbee
was
a
year
older
than
west
and
joel
he
was
in
the
senior
class
and
was
spoken
of
as
one
of
the
smartest
boys
in
the
school
although
a
hampton
house
resident
he
seldom
was
seen
with
the
others
save
at
the
table
and
was
usually
referred
to
among
themselves
as
dig
both
because
that
suggested
his
christian
name
and
because
as
they
said
he
was
forever
digging
at
his
books
in
appearance
albert
digbee
was
a
tall
slender
but
scarcely
frail
youth
with
a
cleanly
cut
face
that
looked
in
the
firelight
far
too
pale
his
eyes
were
strikingly
bright
and
though
his
smiles
were
infrequent
his
habitual
expression
was
one
of
eager
and
kindly
interest
joel
had
often
come
across
him
in
class
and
had
long
wanted
to
know
him
you
see
boys
remsen
was
saying
digbee
here
is
of
the
opinion
that
athletics
in
general
and
football
in
particular
are
harmful
to
schools
and
colleges
as
tending
to
draw
the
attention
of
pupils
from
their
studies
and
i
maintain
the
opposite
now
what
your
opinion
west
digbee
and
i
have
gone
over
it
so
often
that
we
would
like
to
hear
some
one
else
on
the
subject
oh
i
do
know
replied
west
if
fellows
would
give
up
football
and
go
in
for
golf
there
would
be
any
talk
about
athletics
being
hurtful
golf
a
game
that
a
chap
can
play
and
get
through
with
and
have
some
time
for
study
you
do
have
to
train
a
month
to
play
for
an
hour
it
a
sport
that
has
become
a
business
i
can
testify
said
joel
gravely
that
out
is
a
case
in
point
he
plays
golf
and
has
time
left
to
study
how
to
play
more
golf
well
anyhow
you
know
i
study
some
lately
joel
laughed
west
joel
nodded
with
serious
mien
i
think
you
made
a
very
excellent
point
in
favor
of
golf
west
said
digbee
it
has
been
made
a
business
at
least
in
this
school
but
wo
it
eventually
become
quite
as
much
of
a
pursuit
as
football
now
is
oh
it
may
become
as
popular
but
do
you
see
it
will
never
become
as
er
exacting
on
the
fellows
that
play
it
you
can
play
golf
without
having
to
go
into
training
for
it
nevertheless
west
replied
the
head
coach
if
a
fellow
can
play
golf
without
being
in
training
does
it
stand
to
reason
that
the
same
fellow
can
play
a
better
game
if
he
is
in
training
that
is
wo
he
play
a
better
game
if
he
is
in
better
trim
yes
i
guess
so
but
he
will
play
a
game
if
he
train
but
not
as
good
a
game
as
he
will
if
he
does
train
i
suppose
not
admitted
west
well
now
a
fellow
can
play
a
very
good
game
of
football
if
he
in
training
continued
remsen
but
that
same
fellow
if
he
goes
to
bed
and
gets
up
at
regular
hours
and
eats
decent
food
at
decent
times
and
takes
care
of
himself
in
such
a
way
as
to
improve
his
mental
moral
and
physical
person
will
play
a
still
better
game
and
derive
more
benefit
from
it
when
golf
gets
a
firmer
hold
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
schools
and
colleges
will
have
their
golf
teams
of
say
from
two
to
a
dozen
players
of
course
the
team
will
not
play
as
a
team
but
the
members
of
it
will
play
singly
or
in
couples
against
representatives
of
other
schools
and
when
that
happens
it
is
sure
to
follow
that
the
players
will
go
into
almost
as
strict
training
as
the
football
men
do
now
well
that
sounds
funny
exclaimed
west
digbee
thinks
one
of
the
most
objectionable
features
of
football
is
the
fact
that
the
players
go
into
it
so
thoroughly
that
they
train
for
it
and
study
it
and
spend
a
good
deal
of
valuable
time
thinking
about
it
but
to
me
that
is
one
of
its
most
admirable
features
when
a
boy
or
a
man
goes
in
for
athletics
whether
football
or
rowing
or
hockey
he
desires
if
he
is
a
real
being
to
excel
in
it
to
do
that
it
is
necessary
that
he
put
himself
in
the
condition
that
will
allow
of
his
doing
his
very
best
and
to
that
end
he
trains
he
gives
up
pastry
and
takes
to
cereals
he
abandons
his
cigarettes
and
takes
to
fresh
air
he
gives
up
late
hours
at
night
and
substitutes
early
hours
in
the
morning
and
he
is
better
for
doing
so
he
feels
better
looks
better
works
better
plays
better
but
responded
digbee
can
a
boy
who
has
come
to
school
to
study
and
who
has
to
study
to
make
his
schooling
pay
for
itself
can
such
a
boy
afford
the
time
that
all
that
training
and
practicing
requires
usually
yes
answered
remsen
of
course
there
are
boys
and
men
too
for
that
matter
who
are
incapable
of
occupying
their
minds
with
two
distinct
interests
that
kind
should
leave
athletics
alone
and
there
are
others
who
are
naturally
i
guess
i
stupid
and
who
should
they
attempt
to
sandwich
football
or
baseball
into
their
school
life
would
simply
make
a
mess
of
both
study
and
recreation
but
they
need
not
enter
into
the
question
of
the
harm
or
benefit
of
athletics
since
at
every
school
or
college
those
boys
are
not
allowed
to
take
up
with
athletics
yes
generally
speaking
the
boy
who
comes
to
school
to
study
can
afford
to
play
football
train
for
football
and
think
football
because
instead
of
interfering
with
his
studies
it
really
helps
him
with
them
it
makes
him
healthy
strong
and
clearheaded
some
time
i
shall
be
glad
to
show
you
a
whole
stack
of
careful
statistics
which
prove
that
football
men
at
least
rather
than
being
backward
with
studies
are
nearly
always
above
the
average
in
class
standing
march
you
a
football
enthusiast
and
i
understand
that
you
keeping
well
up
with
your
lessons
do
you
have
trouble
to
attend
to
both
do
you
have
to
skimp
your
studies
i
know
you
give
full
attention
to
the
pigskin
i
hard
put
some
days
to
find
time
for
everything
answered
joel
but
i
always
manage
to
make
it
somehow
and
i
have
all
the
sleep
i
want
or
need
perhaps
if
i
gave
up
football
i
might
get
higher
marks
in
recitations
but
i
not
feel
so
well
and
it
possible
that
i
only
get
lower
marks
i
agree
with
you
remsen
that
athletics
or
at
least
football
is
far
more
likely
to
benefit
a
chap
than
to
hurt
him
because
a
fellow
ca
study
well
unless
he
is
in
good
health
and
spirits
are
you
convinced
digbee
asked
remsen
digbee
shook
his
head
smilingly
i
do
believe
i
am
quite
but
you
know
more
about
such
things
than
i
do
in
fact
it
cheeky
for
me
to
argue
about
them
why
i
never
played
anything
but
tennis
and
never
did
even
that
well
you
know
the
ground
you
argue
from
and
because
i
have
overwhelmed
you
with
talk
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
i
am
right
responded
his
host
courteously
but
enough
of
such
dull
themes
there
west
most
march
have
you
heard
from
your
mother
lately
yes
i
received
a
letter
from
her
yesterday
morning
she
writes
that
she
glad
the
relationship
is
settled
finally
says
she
certain
that
any
kin
of
the
maine
remsens
is
a
person
of
good
strong
moral
character
when
the
laugh
had
subsided
remsen
turned
to
west
have
you
ever
heard
of
tommy
collingwood
was
he
baseball
captain
a
good
many
years
ago
yes
and
used
to
row
in
the
boat
well
tommy
was
a
good
deal
better
at
spinning
top
on
academy
steps
than
doing
lessons
and
a
deal
fonder
of
playing
shinney
than
writing
letters
but
tommy
mother
always
insisted
that
tommy
should
write
home
once
a
week
and
tommy
father
wrote
and
explained
what
would
happen
to
tommy
if
he
did
obey
his
mother
and
as
tommy
folks
lived
just
over
in
albany
it
was
a
small
thing
for
tommy
father
to
run
over
some
day
with
a
strap
so
tommy
obeyed
his
parents
and
every
week
wrote
home
his
letters
were
long
nor
were
they
filled
with
a
wealth
of
detail
but
they
answered
the
purpose
in
lieu
of
better
each
one
ran
academy
hillton
with
the
date
father
and
mother
i
am
well
and
studying
hard
your
loving
son
thomas
collingwood
well
when
christmas
recess
came
tommy
went
home
and
one
day
his
mother
complimented
tommy
on
the
regularity
of
his
correspondence
tommy
looked
sheepish
tell
the
truth
mother
i
did
write
one
of
those
letters
each
week
explained
tommy
just
after
school
opened
i
was
sick
for
a
week
and
did
have
anything
to
do
so
i
wrote
am
twelve
times
and
dated
each
ahead
digbee
accompanied
the
other
two
lads
back
to
the
yard
and
he
and
march
discussed
studies
while
west
mooned
along
whistling
half
aloud
and
thrashing
the
weeds
and
rocks
with
his
cudgel
for
the
tramps
refused
to
appear
on
the
scene
he
and
digbee
went
out
of
their
way
to
see
joel
safely
to
his
dormitory
and
then
joel
accompanied
them
on
their
homeward
way
as
far
as
academy
building
there
were
said
and
joel
feeling
but
little
inclined
for
sleep
drew
his
collar
up
and
strolled
to
the
front
of
the
building
where
from
the
high
steps
the
river
was
visible
for
several
miles
in
either
direction
the
moon
was
struggling
out
from
a
mass
of
somber
clouds
overhead
and
the
sound
of
the
waters
as
they
swirled
around
the
rocky
point
was
plainly
heard
joel
sat
there
on
the
steps
under
the
shadow
of
the
dark
building
thinking
of
many
things
and
feeling
very
happy
and
peaceful
until
a
long
shrill
sound
from
the
north
told
of
the
coming
of
the
train
then
he
made
his
way
back
to
masters
up
the
dim
stairs
and
into
his
room
where
dickey
sproule
lay
huddled
in
bed
reading
the
three
guardsmen
by
the
screened
light
of
a
guttering
candle
chapter
x
the
broken
bell
rope
joel
arrived
at
chapel
the
following
morning
just
as
the
doors
were
being
closed
duffy
the
doorkeeper
was
not
on
duty
and
the
youth
upon
whom
his
duties
had
devolved
allowed
joel
to
pass
without
giving
his
name
for
report
as
tardy
during
prayers
there
was
an
evident
atmosphere
of
suppressed
excitement
among
the
pupils
but
not
until
chapel
was
over
did
joel
discover
the
cause
were
you
here
when
it
happened
asked
west
when
what
happened
responded
joel
have
you
heard
why
some
one
cut
the
bell
rope
and
when
went
to
ring
chapel
bell
the
rope
broke
up
in
the
tower
and
came
down
on
his
head
and
laid
him
out
there
on
the
floor
and
some
of
the
fellows
found
him
knocked
senseless
and
they
taken
him
to
the
infirmary
you
know
the
rope
as
big
as
your
wrist
and
it
hit
him
on
top
of
the
head
i
guess
he
is
much
hurt
but
is
as
mad
as
never
was
and
whoever
did
it
will
have
a
hard
time
i
bet
poor
old
duffy
said
joel
let
go
over
and
find
out
if
he
much
hurt
it
was
a
dirty
sort
of
a
joke
to
play
though
i
suppose
whoever
did
it
did
think
it
would
hurt
any
one
at
the
infirmary
they
found
professor
gibbs
in
the
office
no
boys
he
is
damaged
much
he
be
all
right
in
a
few
hours
i
hope
that
the
ones
who
did
it
will
be
severely
punished
it
was
a
most
contemptible
trick
to
put
up
on
duffy
i
hope
so
too
answered
west
indignantly
you
may
depend
that
no
upper
middle
boy
did
it
sir
the
professor
smiled
i
hope
you
are
right
west
at
noon
hour
joel
was
summoned
to
the
principal
office
professor
wheeler
the
secretary
and
professor
durkee
were
present
and
as
joel
entered
he
scented
an
air
of
hostility
the
secretary
closed
the
door
behind
him
march
i
have
sent
for
you
to
ask
whether
you
can
give
us
any
information
which
will
lead
to
the
apprehension
of
the
perpetrators
of
the
trick
which
has
resulted
in
injury
to
duffy
can
you
no
sir
responded
joel
you
know
absolutely
nothing
about
it
nothing
sir
except
what
i
have
been
told
by
whom
outfield
west
sir
after
chapel
we
went
to
the
infirmary
to
inquire
about
about
duffy
sir
the
secretary
repressed
a
smile
the
principal
was
observing
joel
very
closely
and
professor
durkee
moved
impatiently
in
his
seat
i
can
not
suppose
continued
the
principal
that
the
thing
was
done
simply
as
a
school
joke
the
boy
who
cut
the
rope
must
have
known
when
he
did
so
that
the
result
would
be
harmful
to
whoever
rang
the
chapel
bell
this
morning
i
wish
it
understood
that
i
have
no
intention
of
dealing
leniently
with
the
culprit
but
at
the
same
time
a
confession
if
made
now
will
have
the
effect
of
mitigating
his
punishment
he
paused
joel
turned
an
astonished
look
from
him
to
professor
durkee
who
meeting
it
frowned
and
turned
impatiently
away
you
have
nothing
more
to
tell
me
march
why
no
sir
answered
joel
in
a
troubled
voice
i
do
understand
am
i
suspected
of
of
this
thing
sir
dear
me
sir
exclaimed
professor
durkee
explosively
turning
to
the
principal
it
quite
evident
that
one
moment
please
answered
the
latter
firmly
the
other
you
had
town
leave
last
night
march
yes
sir
you
went
with
outfield
west
yes
sir
what
time
did
you
return
to
your
room
at
about
a
quarter
to
ten
sir
you
are
certain
as
to
the
time
i
only
know
that
i
heard
the
down
train
whistle
as
i
left
academy
building
i
went
right
to
my
room
sir
was
the
door
of
academy
building
unlocked
last
night
i
do
know
i
did
try
it
sir
what
time
did
you
leave
remsen
house
a
few
minutes
after
nine
you
came
right
back
here
yes
sir
we
came
as
far
as
academy
building
and
west
and
digbee
went
home
i
sat
on
the
front
steps
here
until
i
heard
the
whistle
blow
then
i
went
to
my
room
why
did
you
sit
on
the
steps
march
i
was
sleepy
and
the
moon
was
coming
out
and
i
wanted
to
think
do
you
hear
from
home
very
often
once
or
twice
a
week
sir
when
did
you
get
a
letter
last
and
from
whom
was
it
from
my
mother
about
three
days
ago
have
you
that
letter
yes
sir
it
is
in
my
room
you
sometimes
carry
your
letters
in
your
pocket
why
yes
but
not
often
if
i
receive
them
on
the
way
out
of
the
building
i
put
them
in
my
pocket
and
then
put
them
away
when
i
get
back
where
do
you
keep
them
in
my
bureau
drawer
it
is
kept
locked
no
sir
i
never
lock
it
do
you
remember
what
was
in
that
last
letter
yes
sir
was
any
one
mentioned
in
it
yes
sir
remsen
was
mentioned
and
outfield
west
and
my
brother
and
father
is
this
your
letter
professor
wheeler
extended
it
across
the
desk
and
joel
took
it
wonderingly
why
yes
sir
but
where
i
do
understand
again
he
looked
toward
professor
durkee
in
bewilderment
nor
do
i
answered
that
gentleman
dryly
march
continued
the
principal
as
he
took
the
letter
again
this
was
found
this
morning
after
the
accident
on
the
floor
of
the
bell
tower
do
you
know
how
it
came
there
joel
cheeks
reddened
and
then
grew
white
as
the
full
meaning
of
the
words
reached
him
his
voice
suddenly
grew
husky
no
sir
i
do
not
the
words
were
spoken
very
stoutly
and
rang
with
sincerity
a
silence
fell
on
the
room
professor
wheeler
glanced
inquiringly
at
professor
durkee
and
the
latter
made
a
grimace
of
impatience
that
snarled
his
homely
face
into
a
mass
of
wrinkles
look
here
boy
he
snapped
who
do
you
think
dropped
that
letter
there
i
ca
think
sir
i
ca
understand
it
at
all
i
never
been
in
the
tower
since
i
been
in
school
do
you
know
of
any
one
who
might
like
to
get
you
into
trouble
in
such
a
way
as
this
no
sir
answered
joel
promptly
then
a
sudden
recollection
of
bartlett
cloud
came
to
him
and
he
hesitated
professor
durkee
observed
it
well
he
said
sharply
i
know
of
no
one
sir
humph
grunted
the
professor
you
do
but
you
wo
say
if
you
suspect
any
one
it
will
be
best
to
tell
us
march
said
professor
wheeler
more
kindly
you
must
see
that
the
evidence
is
much
against
you
and
while
i
myself
can
not
believe
that
you
are
guilty
i
shall
be
obliged
to
consider
you
so
until
proof
of
your
innocence
is
forthcoming
have
you
any
enemy
in
school
i
think
not
sir
the
door
opened
and
remsen
appeared
he
said
you
wished
to
see
me
professor
yes
in
a
moment
sit
down
please
remsen
remsen
nodded
to
joel
and
the
secretary
shook
hands
with
professor
durkee
and
took
a
chair
the
principal
turned
again
to
joel
you
wish
me
to
understand
then
that
you
have
no
explanation
to
offer
as
to
how
the
letter
came
to
be
in
the
bell
tower
recollect
that
shielding
a
friend
or
any
other
pupil
will
do
neither
you
nor
him
any
service
joel
was
hesitating
was
it
right
to
throw
suspicion
on
bartlett
cloud
by
mentioning
the
small
occurrence
on
the
football
field
so
long
before
it
was
inconceivable
that
cloud
would
go
to
such
a
length
in
mere
spite
and
yet
remsen
interrupted
his
thoughts
professor
if
you
will
dismiss
march
for
a
while
perhaps
i
can
throw
some
light
on
the
matter
let
him
return
in
half
an
hour
or
so
professor
wheeler
nodded
come
back
at
one
march
he
said
outside
joel
hesitated
where
to
go
he
must
tell
some
one
his
trouble
and
there
was
only
one
who
would
really
care
he
turned
toward
hampton
house
then
remembered
that
it
was
dinner
hour
and
that
outfield
would
be
at
table
he
had
forgotten
his
own
dinner
until
that
moment
in
the
dining
hall
west
was
still
lingering
over
his
dessert
joel
took
his
seat
at
the
training
table
explaining
his
absence
by
saying
that
he
had
been
called
to
the
office
and
hurried
through
a
dinner
of
beef
and
rice
and
milk
when
west
arose
joel
overtook
him
at
the
door
and
as
the
friends
took
their
way
toward
joel
room
he
told
everything
to
west
in
words
that
tumbled
over
each
other
outfield
west
heard
him
in
silence
after
one
exclamation
of
surprise
and
when
joel
had
finished
cried
why
did
you
tell
about
cloud
do
you
see
that
this
is
his
doing
that
he
is
getting
even
with
you
for
his
losing
the
football
team
i
thought
of
that
out
but
it
seemed
too
silly
to
suppose
that
he
would
do
such
a
thing
just
for
for
that
you
know
well
you
may
be
certain
that
he
did
do
it
or
at
least
if
he
cut
the
rope
himself
found
some
one
to
do
it
for
him
it
just
the
kind
of
a
revenge
that
a
fellow
of
his
meanness
would
think
of
he
stand
up
and
fight
like
a
man
here
let
go
and
find
him
no
wait
i
tell
professor
wheeler
about
him
when
i
go
back
then
if
he
thinks
if
he
did
do
it
out
i
lick
him
good
for
it
hooray
and
when
you
get
through
i
take
a
hand
too
but
what
do
you
suppose
remsen
was
going
to
tell
joel
shook
his
head
they
found
sproule
in
the
room
and
to
him
west
spoke
as
follows
hello
dickey
you
not
studying
it
not
good
for
you
these
sudden
changes
should
be
avoided
sproule
laughed
but
looked
annoyed
at
the
banter
joel
and
i
have
come
up
for
a
chat
dickey
continued
west
now
you
take
your
robinson
crusoe
and
read
somewhere
else
for
a
while
like
a
nice
boy
sproule
grew
and
turned
to
west
angrily
do
you
see
i
studying
if
you
and
march
want
to
talk
why
either
go
somewhere
else
or
talk
here
but
our
talk
is
private
dickey
and
not
intended
for
little
ears
you
know
the
saying
about
little
pitchers
dickey
well
i
not
going
out
so
you
can
talk
or
not
as
you
like
oh
yes
you
are
going
out
dickey
politeness
requires
it
and
i
shall
see
that
you
maintain
that
delightful
courteousness
for
which
you
are
noted
now
dickey
west
indicated
the
door
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
sproule
bent
his
head
over
his
book
and
growled
a
response
that
sounded
anything
but
polite
then
west
still
smiling
seized
the
unobliging
youth
by
the
shoulders
pinioning
his
arms
to
his
sides
and
pushed
him
away
from
the
table
and
toward
the
door
joel
rescued
the
lamp
at
a
critical
moment
the
chairs
went
over
on
to
the
floor
and
a
minute
later
sproule
was
on
the
farther
side
of
the
bolted
door
and
west
was
adjusting
his
rumpled
attire
i
report
you
for
this
outfield
west
howled
sproule
through
the
door
in
a
passion
of
resentment
report
away
answered
west
mockingly
and
if
i
miss
my
latin
i
tell
why
too
well
you
miss
it
all
right
enough
unless
you
changed
mightily
but
here
i
shy
your
book
through
the
transom
this
was
done
and
the
sound
of
ascending
feet
on
the
stairway
reaching
sproule
ears
at
that
moment
he
grabbed
his
book
and
took
himself
off
muttering
vengeance
have
you
looked
asked
west
yes
it
not
there
but
there
are
no
others
missing
who
could
have
taken
it
any
one
my
boy
bartlett
cloud
for
preference
your
door
is
unlocked
he
comes
in
when
he
knows
you
are
out
looks
on
the
table
sees
nothing
there
that
will
serve
goes
to
the
bureau
opens
the
top
drawer
and
finds
a
pile
of
letters
he
takes
the
first
one
which
is
of
course
the
last
received
and
sneaks
out
then
he
climbs
into
the
bell
tower
at
night
cuts
the
rope
through
all
but
one
small
strand
and
puts
your
letter
on
the
floor
where
it
will
be
found
in
the
morning
is
that
plain
enough
joel
nodded
forlornly
but
cheer
up
joel
your
uncle
out
will
see
your
innocence
established
firmly
and
beyond
all
question
and
now
come
on
it
one
and
you
got
to
go
back
to
the
office
while
i
got
a
class
come
over
to
my
room
at
four
joel
and
tell
me
what
happens
remsen
and
the
secretary
were
no
longer
in
the
office
when
joel
returned
professor
durkee
was
standing
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
apparently
about
to
leave
march
began
the
principal
remsen
tells
us
that
you
were
struck
at
by
bartlett
cloud
on
the
football
field
one
day
at
practice
is
that
so
joel
replied
affirmatively
does
he
speak
to
you
or
you
to
him
no
sir
but
then
i
never
been
acquainted
with
him
do
you
believe
that
he
could
have
stolen
that
letter
from
your
room
i
know
that
he
could
have
done
so
sir
but
i
do
like
to
think
that
he
did
well
possibly
he
did
and
possibly
he
did
i
shall
endeavor
to
find
out
meanwhile
i
must
ask
you
to
let
this
go
no
further
you
will
go
on
as
though
this
conversation
had
never
occurred
if
i
find
that
you
are
unjustly
suspected
i
will
summon
you
and
ask
your
pardon
and
the
guilty
one
will
be
punished
professor
durkee
here
has
pointed
out
to
me
that
such
conduct
is
totally
foreign
to
his
conception
of
your
character
and
has
reminded
me
that
your
standing
in
class
has
been
of
the
best
since
the
beginning
of
the
term
i
agree
with
him
in
all
this
but
duty
in
the
affair
is
very
plain
and
i
have
been
performing
it
unpleasant
as
it
is
you
may
go
now
march
and
kindly
remember
that
this
affair
must
be
kept
quiet
joel
turned
with
a
surprised
but
grateful
look
toward
professor
durkee
but
was
met
with
a
wrathful
scowl
joel
hurried
to
his
recitation
and
later
before
west
fireplace
the
friends
discussed
the
unfortunate
affair
in
all
its
phases
and
resolved
with
vehemence
to
know
the
truth
sooner
or
later
but
joel
cup
was
not
yet
filled
when
he
returned
to
the
dormitory
after
supper
he
found
two
missives
awaiting
him
the
first
was
from
wesley
blair
dear
march
it
read
please
show
up
in
the
morning
at
burke
for
breakfast
with
the
first
eleven
you
are
to
take
the
place
of
post
at
it
will
be
necessary
for
you
to
report
at
the
gym
at
eleven
each
day
for
noon
signals
please
arrange
your
recitations
to
this
end
i
am
writing
this
because
i
could
see
you
this
afternoon
hope
you
are
all
right
yours
wesley
blair
joel
read
this
with
a
loudly
beating
heart
and
flushing
cheeks
it
was
as
unexpected
as
it
was
welcome
that
news
he
hoped
for
an
occasional
chance
to
substitute
post
or
blair
or
clausen
on
the
first
team
in
some
minor
game
but
to
be
taken
on
as
a
member
was
more
than
he
had
even
thought
of
since
he
had
found
how
very
far
from
perfect
was
his
playing
he
seized
his
cap
with
the
intention
of
racing
across
to
hampton
and
informing
west
of
his
luck
then
he
remembered
the
other
note
it
was
from
the
office
and
it
was
with
a
sinking
heart
that
he
tore
it
open
and
read
you
are
placed
upon
probation
until
further
notice
from
the
faculty
the
rules
and
regulations
require
that
pupils
on
probation
abstain
from
all
sports
and
keep
their
rooms
in
the
evenings
except
upon
permission
from
the
principal
respectfully
curtis
gordon
secretary
chapter
xi
two
heroes
one
afternoon
a
week
later
outfield
west
and
joel
march
were
seated
on
the
ledge
where
nearly
two
months
before
they
had
begun
their
friendship
the
sun
beat
warmly
down
and
the
hill
at
their
backs
kept
off
the
east
wind
below
them
the
river
was
brightly
blue
and
a
skiff
dipping
its
way
up
stream
caught
the
sunlight
on
sail
and
hull
until
as
it
danced
from
sight
around
the
headland
it
looked
like
a
white
gull
hovering
over
the
water
above
on
the
campus
the
football
field
was
noisy
with
voices
and
the
pipe
of
the
referee
whistle
and
farther
up
the
river
at
the
boathouse
moving
figures
showed
that
some
of
the
boys
were
about
to
take
advantage
of
the
pleasant
afternoon
some
one
going
rowing
observed
outfield
can
you
row
joel
i
guess
so
i
never
tried
west
laughed
then
i
guess
you
ca
i
tried
it
like
trying
to
write
with
both
hands
while
you
looking
after
one
the
other
has
fits
and
runs
all
over
the
paper
if
you
pull
with
the
left
oar
the
right
oar
goes
up
in
the
air
or
tries
to
throw
you
out
of
the
boat
by
getting
caught
in
the
water
paddling
suits
me
better
say
you
see
a
bully
race
next
spring
when
we
meet
eustace
last
spring
they
walked
away
from
us
but
the
crew
is
to
have
a
new
boat
next
year
look
those
two
fellows
row
well
do
they
remsen
says
a
chap
can
never
learn
to
row
unless
he
has
been
born
near
the
water
that
lets
me
out
in
iowa
we
have
any
water
nearer
than
the
mississippi
except
the
red
cedar
and
that
does
count
by
the
way
joel
what
did
remsen
say
to
you
last
night
about
playing
again
he
said
to
keep
in
condition
so
that
in
case
i
got
off
probation
i
could
go
right
back
to
work
he
says
he
do
all
he
can
to
help
me
and
i
know
he
will
but
it
wo
do
any
good
wo
let
me
play
until
he
found
out
who
did
that
trick
it
bad
enough
out
to
be
blamed
for
the
thing
when
i
did
do
it
but
to
lose
the
football
team
like
this
is
a
hundred
times
worse
i
almost
wish
i
cut
that
old
rope
continued
joel
savagely
then
i
at
least
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
i
was
only
getting
what
i
deserved
west
looked
properly
sympathetic
it
a
beastly
shame
that
what
i
think
what
the
good
of
you
innocent
as
says
if
he
goes
ahead
and
punishes
you
for
the
affair
what
why
there
is
any
of
course
if
it
was
me
i
cut
the
pesky
rope
every
chance
i
got
until
they
let
up
on
me
joel
smiled
despite
his
ill
humor
and
i
lost
half
my
interest
in
lessons
out
i
try
not
to
but
i
ca
help
it
i
guess
my
chance
at
the
scholarship
is
gone
higher
than
a
kite
oh
hang
the
scholarship
exclaimed
west
but
there
the
eustace
game
in
three
weeks
if
you
do
play
in
that
joel
i
go
to
and
tell
him
what
i
think
about
it
it
awfully
rough
on
a
fellow
out
but
professor
wheeler
is
only
doing
what
is
right
i
suppose
he
ca
let
the
thing
go
unnoticed
you
see
and
as
long
as
i
ca
prove
my
innocence
i
guess
he
right
to
hold
me
to
blame
for
it
tommyrot
answered
west
explosively
the
faculty
just
trying
to
have
us
beaten
why
say
do
tell
a
soul
joel
but
blair
worried
half
crazy
they
had
him
up
yesterday
and
told
him
that
if
he
did
get
better
marks
from
now
on
he
could
play
what
do
you
think
of
that
they
not
about
it
they
trying
to
put
us
on
probation
why
how
do
i
know
but
what
they
put
on
outfield
hit
his
shoe
violently
with
the
driver
he
held
until
it
hurt
him
for
although
joel
was
debarred
from
playing
golf
there
was
nothing
to
keep
him
from
watching
west
play
and
this
afternoon
the
two
had
been
half
over
the
course
together
west
explaining
the
game
and
joel
listening
intently
and
all
the
while
longing
to
take
a
club
in
hand
and
have
a
whack
at
the
ball
himself
that
bad
answered
joel
thoughtfully
it
would
be
all
up
with
us
if
blair
should
play
and
that
just
what
going
to
happen
if
keeps
up
his
present
game
responded
outfield
who
are
those
chaps
in
that
shell
joel
one
looks
like
cloud
the
fellow
in
front
joel
watched
the
approaching
craft
for
a
moment
it
is
cloud
he
answered
and
that
looks
like
clausen
with
him
why
is
he
practicing
i
wonder
have
you
heard
he
was
dropped
from
the
team
yesterday
wills
has
his
place
post
says
by
the
way
that
he
sorry
you
in
such
a
fix
but
he
mighty
glad
to
get
back
on
the
first
he
an
awfully
decent
chap
is
post
did
you
see
that
thing
he
has
in
this
month
hilltonian
about
cooke
says
the
fac
going
to
establish
a
class
in
bakery
and
put
cooke
in
as
teacher
because
he
such
a
fine
say
what
the
matter
down
there
the
shell
containing
cloud
and
clausen
had
reached
a
point
almost
opposite
to
where
west
and
joel
were
perched
and
as
the
latter
looked
toward
it
at
west
exclamation
he
saw
cloud
throw
aside
his
oars
and
stand
upright
in
the
boat
clausen
had
turned
and
was
looking
at
his
friend
but
still
held
his
oars
by
jove
joel
she
sinking
cried
outfield
look
why
clausen
get
out
there
goes
cloud
over
i
wonder
if
clausen
can
swim
swim
come
on
and
half
tumbling
half
climbing
west
sped
down
the
bank
on
to
the
tiny
strip
of
rocks
and
gravel
that
lay
along
the
water
joel
followed
cloud
now
was
in
the
water
at
a
little
distance
from
the
shell
which
had
settled
to
the
gunwales
clausen
plainly
in
a
state
of
terror
was
kneeling
in
the
sinking
boat
and
crying
to
the
other
lad
for
help
the
next
moment
he
was
in
the
water
and
his
shouts
reached
the
two
lads
on
the
beach
cloud
swam
toward
him
but
before
he
could
reach
him
clausen
had
gone
from
sight
what
shall
we
do
cried
west
he
drowning
can
you
swim
for
joel
had
already
divested
himself
of
his
coat
and
vest
and
was
cutting
the
lacings
of
his
shoes
west
hesitated
an
instant
only
then
followed
suit
yes
off
went
the
last
shoe
and
joel
ran
into
the
water
west
pale
of
face
but
with
a
determined
look
in
his
blue
eyes
followed
a
moment
later
a
yard
or
two
behind
and
the
two
set
out
with
desperate
strokes
to
reach
the
scene
of
the
disaster
as
he
had
taken
the
water
joel
had
cast
a
hurried
glance
toward
the
spot
where
clausen
had
sunk
and
had
seen
nothing
of
that
youth
only
cloud
was
in
sight
and
he
seemed
to
be
swimming
hurriedly
toward
shore
joel
went
at
the
task
hand
over
hand
and
heard
behind
him
west
laboring
greatly
at
his
swimming
presently
joel
heard
his
name
cried
in
an
exhausted
voice
i
ca
make
it
joel
shouted
west
i
have
to
turn
back
all
right
joel
called
go
up
to
the
field
and
send
some
one
for
help
then
he
turned
his
attention
again
to
his
strokes
and
raising
his
head
once
saw
an
open
river
before
him
with
nothing
in
sight
between
him
and
the
opposite
bank
save
farther
down
stream
a
floating
oar
he
had
made
some
allowance
for
the
current
and
when
in
another
moment
he
had
reached
what
seemed
to
him
to
be
near
the
scene
of
the
catastrophe
yet
a
little
farther
down
stream
he
trod
water
and
looked
about
under
the
bluff
to
the
right
cloud
was
crawling
from
the
river
west
was
gone
from
sight
about
him
ran
the
stream
and
save
for
its
noise
no
sound
came
to
him
and
nothing
rewarded
his
eager
searching
gaze
save
a
branch
that
floated
slowly
by
with
despair
at
his
heart
he
threw
up
his
arms
and
sank
with
eyes
peering
about
him
in
the
hazy
depths
above
him
the
surface
water
bubbled
and
eddied
below
him
was
darkness
around
him
was
only
green
twilight
for
a
moment
he
tarried
there
and
then
arose
to
the
surface
and
dashed
the
water
from
his
eyes
and
face
and
suddenly
some
thirty
feet
away
an
arm
clad
in
a
white
sweater
sleeve
came
slowly
into
sight
with
a
frantic
leap
through
the
water
joel
sped
toward
it
a
bare
head
followed
the
upstretched
arm
two
wild
eyes
opened
and
looked
despairingly
at
the
peaceful
blue
heavens
the
white
lips
moved
but
no
sound
came
from
them
and
then
just
as
the
eyes
closed
and
just
as
the
body
began
to
sink
as
slowly
as
it
had
arisen
and
for
the
last
time
joel
reached
it
there
was
no
time
left
in
which
to
pause
and
select
a
hold
of
the
drowning
boy
and
joel
caught
savagely
at
his
arm
and
struck
toward
the
bank
and
the
inert
body
came
to
the
surface
like
a
plank
clausen
shouted
joel
clausen
can
you
hear
brace
up
strike
out
with
your
right
hand
and
do
grab
me
do
you
hear
but
there
was
no
answer
clausen
was
like
stone
in
the
water
joel
cast
a
despairing
glance
toward
the
bluff
then
his
eyes
brightened
for
there
sliding
down
the
bank
he
saw
a
crowd
of
boys
and
as
he
looked
another
on
the
bluff
threw
down
a
coil
of
new
rope
that
shone
in
the
afternoon
sunlight
as
it
fell
and
was
seized
by
some
one
in
the
throng
below
nerved
afresh
joel
took
a
firm
grasp
on
clausen
elbow
and
struck
out
manfully
for
shore
it
was
hard
going
and
when
a
bare
dozen
long
strokes
had
been
made
his
burden
so
dragged
him
down
that
he
was
obliged
to
stop
and
floundering
desperately
to
keep
the
white
face
above
water
take
a
fresh
store
of
breath
into
his
aching
lungs
then
drawing
the
other
boy
to
him
so
that
his
weight
fell
on
his
back
he
brought
one
limp
arm
about
his
shoulder
and
holding
it
there
with
his
left
hand
started
swimming
once
more
a
dozen
more
strokes
were
accomplished
slowly
painfully
and
then
as
encouraging
shouts
came
from
shore
he
felt
the
body
above
him
stir
into
life
heard
a
low
cry
of
terror
in
his
ear
and
then
they
were
sinking
together
clausen
and
he
struggling
there
beneath
the
surface
clausen
had
his
arm
about
joel
neck
and
was
pulling
him
down
down
and
just
as
his
lungs
seemed
upon
the
point
of
bursting
the
grasp
relaxed
around
his
neck
the
body
began
to
sink
and
joel
to
rise
with
a
deafening
noise
as
of
rushing
water
in
his
ears
joel
reached
caught
a
handful
of
cloth
and
struggled
half
drowned
himself
to
the
surface
and
then
some
one
caught
him
by
the
chin
and
he
knew
no
more
until
he
awoke
as
from
a
bad
dream
to
find
himself
lying
in
the
sun
on
the
narrow
beach
while
several
faces
looked
down
into
his
did
you
get
him
he
asked
weakly
yep
answered
outfield
west
with
something
that
sounded
like
a
sob
in
his
voice
he
over
there
he
all
right
do
get
up
he
continued
as
joel
tried
to
move
stay
where
you
are
the
fellows
are
bringing
a
boat
and
we
take
you
both
back
in
it
all
right
answered
joel
but
i
guess
i
just
look
around
a
bit
and
he
sat
up
at
a
little
distance
a
group
among
which
joel
recognized
the
broad
back
of
professor
gibbs
were
still
working
over
clausen
but
even
as
he
looked
joel
was
delighted
to
see
clausen
legs
move
and
hear
his
weak
voice
speaking
to
the
professor
then
the
boat
was
rowed
in
the
occupants
panting
with
their
hurried
pull
from
the
boathouse
and
joel
clambered
aboard
disdaining
the
proffered
help
of
west
and
others
and
clausen
was
lifted
to
a
seat
in
the
bow
on
the
way
up
river
joel
told
how
it
happened
west
throwing
in
an
eager
word
here
and
there
and
clausen
in
a
low
whisper
explaining
that
the
shell
had
struck
on
a
sunken
rock
or
snag
when
passing
the
island
and
had
begun
to
sink
almost
immediately
and
cloud
asked
professor
gibbs
there
was
no
reply
from
either
joel
or
clausen
only
one
of
the
rowers
answered
coldly
he
safe
i
saw
him
on
the
path
near
the
society
building
he
was
running
toward
warren
a
silence
followed
then
you
never
learned
to
swim
clausen
no
sir
but
it
is
the
rule
that
no
boy
is
allowed
on
the
river
who
can
not
swim
how
is
that
i
i
said
i
could
sir
humph
your
lie
came
near
to
costing
you
dear
clausen
then
no
more
was
said
in
the
boat
until
the
float
was
reached
although
each
occupant
was
busy
with
his
thoughts
clausen
was
helped
pale
and
shaking
to
his
room
and
west
and
joel
accompanied
by
several
of
their
schoolmates
trotted
away
to
the
gymnasium
where
joel
was
put
through
an
invigorating
bath
and
a
subsequent
rubbing
that
left
him
none
the
worse
for
his
adventure
the
story
had
to
be
told
over
and
over
to
each
new
group
that
came
in
after
practice
and
finally
the
two
friends
escaped
to
west
room
where
they
discussed
the
affair
from
the
of
participants
when
i
got
back
to
the
bluff
with
the
other
fellows
you
were
to
be
seen
joel
west
was
saying
and
i
thought
it
was
all
up
with
poor
old
joel
march
that
just
what
i
thought
a
bit
later
responded
joel
when
that
fellow
had
me
round
the
neck
and
was
trying
to
show
me
the
bottom
of
the
river
and
then
when
they
brought
you
in
whipple
and
christie
and
you
were
all
white
and
and
ghastly
like
you
know
outfield
west
whistled
long
and
expressively
then
i
thought
you
a
goner
joel
nodded
and
cloud
he
asked
presently
cloud
has
settled
himself
responded
west
when
he
thought
clausen
was
drowning
he
just
cut
and
ran
i
mean
swam
to
shore
the
fellows
are
madder
than
hornets
as
whipple
said
you
ca
insist
on
a
fellow
saving
another
fellow
from
drowning
but
you
can
insist
on
his
not
running
away
they
planning
to
show
cloud
what
they
think
of
him
somehow
they
would
talk
about
it
while
i
was
around
i
wonder
why
outfield
stopped
suddenly
and
frowned
perplexedly
why
a
month
or
six
weeks
ago
i
would
have
been
one
of
the
first
they
would
have
asked
to
help
i
afraid
it
associating
with
you
joel
you
corrupting
me
say
did
i
make
a
mess
of
it
this
afternoon
i
got
about
ten
yards
off
the
beach
and
just
had
to
give
up
and
pull
back
and
pull
hard
blessed
if
i
did
begin
to
wonder
once
if
i
make
it
the
fact
is
joel
i
an
awful
dab
at
swimming
and
i
ought
to
be
punched
for
letting
you
go
out
there
all
alone
nonsense
out
you
could
help
getting
tired
especially
if
you
are
much
of
a
swimmer
and
now
you
speak
of
it
i
remember
you
saying
once
that
you
could
joel
stopped
short
and
looked
at
west
in
wondering
amazement
and
west
grew
red
and
his
eyes
sought
the
floor
and
for
almost
a
minute
there
was
silence
in
the
room
then
joel
arose
and
stood
over
the
other
lad
with
shining
eyes
out
he
muttered
huskily
you
a
brick
west
made
no
reply
but
his
feet
shuffled
nervously
on
the
hearth
to
think
of
you
starting
out
there
after
me
why
you
the
the
hero
out
not
me
at
all
oh
shut
up
muttered
west
i
not
i
tell
every
one
in
school
cried
joel
i
if
you
do
joel
march
i
thrash
you
cried
west
you
ca
you
ca
out
then
he
paused
and
laid
a
hand
affectionately
on
the
other
shoulder
as
he
asked
softly
and
it
really
so
out
you
ca
west
shook
his
head
i
afraid
it
so
joel
he
answered
apologetically
you
see
out
in
iowa
there
is
much
chance
for
a
chap
to
learn
and
and
so
before
this
afternoon
joel
i
never
swam
a
stroke
in
my
life
chapter
xii
the
probation
of
blair
wallace
clausen
narrow
escape
from
death
and
joel
heroic
rescue
were
wonders
in
the
little
world
of
the
academy
and
village
in
every
room
that
night
the
incident
was
discussed
from
a
to
z
foolhardiness
march
grit
and
courage
west
coolness
cowardice
and
next
morning
at
chapel
when
joel
fearing
to
be
late
hurried
in
and
down
the
side
aisle
to
his
seat
his
appearance
was
the
signal
for
such
an
enthusiastic
outburst
of
cheers
and
acclamations
that
he
stopped
looked
about
in
bewilderment
and
then
slipped
with
crimson
cheeks
into
his
seat
the
very
uncomfortable
cynosure
of
all
eyes
older
boys
who
were
supposed
to
know
stoutly
averred
that
such
a
desecration
of
the
sacred
solitude
of
chapel
had
never
before
been
heard
of
and
long
since
recovered
from
his
contact
with
the
bell
rope
shook
his
gray
head
doubtfully
and
joined
his
feeble
tones
with
the
cheers
of
the
others
and
then
professor
wheeler
made
his
voice
heard
and
commanded
silence
very
sternly
yet
with
a
lurking
smile
and
silence
was
almost
secured
when
just
as
the
door
was
being
closed
outfield
west
slipped
through
smiling
his
handsome
face
flushed
from
his
tear
across
the
yard
and
again
the
applause
burst
forth
scarcely
less
great
in
volume
or
enthusiasm
and
west
literally
bolted
back
to
the
door
found
it
closed
was
met
with
a
grinning
shake
of
the
head
from
duffy
looked
wildly
about
for
an
avenue
of
escape
and
finding
none
slunk
to
his
seat
at
joel
side
while
the
boys
joined
laughter
at
his
plight
to
their
cheers
for
his
courage
you
promised
not
to
tell
hissed
west
with
blazing
cheek
i
did
out
not
a
word
whispered
joel
many
eyes
were
still
turned
toward
the
door
but
their
owners
were
doomed
to
disappointment
for
bartlett
cloud
failed
to
appear
at
chapel
that
morning
preferring
to
accept
the
penalty
of
absence
rather
than
face
his
assembled
there
in
a
body
but
he
did
not
escape
public
degradation
for
although
he
waited
until
the
last
moment
to
go
to
breakfast
he
found
the
hall
filled
and
so
passed
to
his
seat
amid
a
storm
of
hisses
that
plainly
told
the
contempt
in
which
his
schoolmates
held
him
and
then
as
though
scorning
to
remain
in
his
presence
the
place
emptied
as
though
by
magic
and
he
was
left
with
burning
cheeks
to
eat
his
breakfast
in
solitude
joel
and
outfield
were
publicly
thanked
and
commended
by
the
principal
and
every
master
had
a
handshake
and
a
kind
and
earnest
word
for
them
the
boys
learned
that
clausen
had
taken
a
severe
cold
from
his
immersion
in
the
icy
water
and
had
gone
to
the
infirmary
thither
they
went
and
made
inquiry
he
would
be
up
in
a
day
or
two
said
creelman
but
they
could
not
see
him
since
professor
gibbs
had
charged
that
the
patient
was
not
to
be
disturbed
and
so
leaving
word
for
him
when
he
should
awake
joel
and
west
took
themselves
away
relieved
at
not
having
to
receive
any
more
thanks
just
then
but
three
days
later
clausen
left
the
infirmary
fully
recovered
and
joel
came
face
to
face
with
him
on
the
steps
of
academy
building
a
number
of
fellows
on
their
way
to
recitations
stopped
and
watched
the
meeting
clausen
colored
painfully
appeared
to
hesitate
for
a
moment
and
then
went
to
joel
and
held
out
his
hand
which
was
taken
and
gripped
warmly
march
it
hard
work
thanking
a
fellow
for
saving
your
life
and
i
do
know
how
to
do
it
very
well
but
i
guess
you
understand
that
that
oh
hang
it
march
you
know
what
i
like
to
say
i
more
grateful
than
i
could
tell
you
ever
we
have
been
friends
but
it
was
my
fault
i
know
and
if
you
let
me
i
like
to
be
to
know
you
better
you
more
than
welcome
clausen
for
what
i
did
i
awfully
glad
west
and
i
happened
to
be
on
hand
but
there
was
anything
that
you
or
any
fellow
could
have
done
just
as
well
or
better
because
i
came
plaguey
near
making
a
mess
of
it
anyhow
it
well
through
with
as
for
being
friends
i
be
very
glad
to
be
clausen
and
if
you
mind
climbing
stairs
and
have
a
chance
come
up
and
see
me
this
evening
will
you
yes
thanks
er
well
then
and
clausen
strode
off
after
supper
west
and
clausen
came
up
to
joel
room
and
the
four
boys
sat
and
discussed
all
the
topics
known
to
school
richard
sproule
was
at
his
best
and
strove
to
do
his
share
of
the
entertaining
succeeding
quite
beyond
joel
expectations
when
the
conversation
drew
around
to
the
subject
of
the
upsetting
on
the
river
clausen
seemed
willing
enough
to
tell
his
own
experiences
but
became
silent
when
cloud
name
was
mentioned
i
changed
my
room
and
have
seen
cloud
since
to
speak
to
he
said
and
so
cloud
name
was
omitted
from
discussion
i
sorry
said
clausen
that
i
made
such
a
dunce
of
myself
when
you
were
trying
to
get
me
out
i
do
believe
i
knew
what
i
was
doing
i
do
remember
it
at
all
i
sure
you
did
answered
joel
i
guess
a
fellow
just
naturally
would
you
know
but
i
was
glad
when
you
let
go
yes
you
must
have
been
the
fellows
all
say
you
were
terribly
plucky
to
keep
at
it
the
way
you
did
when
they
got
you
it
was
all
they
could
do
to
make
you
let
go
of
me
they
say
the
queerest
thing
said
west
with
a
laugh
was
to
see
post
standing
on
shore
and
trying
to
throw
a
line
to
you
all
it
never
came
within
twenty
yards
of
you
but
he
kept
on
shouting
hold
catch
hold
ca
you
why
do
you
catch
hold
you
stupid
apes
and
some
one
told
me
said
sproule
that
whipple
took
his
shoes
sweater
and
breeches
off
and
swam
out
there
with
his
on
used
it
for
a
suggested
did
you
get
lectured
clausen
yes
he
gave
it
to
me
hard
but
he
a
nice
old
duffer
after
all
said
i
had
had
pretty
near
punishment
enough
but
i
got
to
keep
in
bounds
all
term
and
ca
go
on
the
river
again
until
i
learn
how
to
swim
should
think
you
want
to
answered
sproule
are
you
still
on
probation
march
asked
clausen
yes
and
it
does
look
as
though
i
ever
get
off
if
i
could
find
out
who
cut
that
rope
i
i
well
i
must
be
going
back
exclaimed
clausen
hurriedly
i
wish
march
you
come
and
see
me
some
time
my
room
warren
i
in
with
a
junior
by
the
name
of
bowler
know
him
joel
did
know
the
junior
but
promised
to
call
and
west
and
clausen
said
and
stumbled
down
the
stairway
together
the
next
morning
joel
dashed
out
from
his
history
recitation
plump
into
stephen
remsen
who
was
on
his
way
to
the
office
well
march
congratulations
i
just
back
from
a
trip
home
and
was
going
to
look
you
up
this
afternoon
and
shake
hands
with
you
i
do
it
now
you
a
hero
march
i
do
feel
like
a
hero
either
laughed
joel
in
an
endeavor
to
change
the
subject
i
just
out
from
greek
history
and
if
i
could
tell
oman
what
i
think
yes
but
tell
me
how
did
you
manage
but
we
talk
about
that
some
other
time
you
feeling
all
right
after
the
wetting
are
you
and
as
joel
answered
yes
he
continued
do
you
think
you
could
go
to
work
again
on
the
team
if
i
could
manage
to
get
you
off
probation
try
me
cried
joel
do
you
think
they
let
up
on
me
i
almost
certain
of
it
i
on
my
way
now
to
see
professor
wheeler
and
i
ask
him
about
you
i
have
scarcely
any
doubt
but
that
after
your
conduct
the
other
day
he
will
consent
to
reinstate
you
march
if
i
ask
him
and
i
shall
be
mighty
glad
to
do
so
to
tell
the
truth
worried
pretty
badly
about
well
never
mind
never
cross
a
river
until
you
come
to
it
but
remsen
sir
said
joel
do
you
mean
that
he
will
let
me
play
just
because
just
on
account
of
what
happened
the
other
day
on
account
of
that
and
because
your
general
conduct
has
been
of
the
best
and
also
because
they
have
all
along
believed
you
innocent
of
the
charge
march
you
know
i
told
you
that
when
cloud
and
clausen
were
examined
each
swore
that
the
other
had
not
left
the
room
that
evening
and
accounted
for
each
other
every
moment
all
that
day
but
nevertheless
i
am
positive
that
professor
wheeler
took
little
stock
in
their
testimony
and
as
for
professor
durkee
why
he
the
whole
thing
you
seem
to
have
made
a
conquest
of
professor
durkee
march
he
was
very
kind
answered
joel
thoughtfully
i
do
believe
remsen
that
i
want
to
be
let
off
that
way
he
went
on
i
no
less
guilty
of
cutting
the
bell
rope
than
i
was
before
the
accident
on
the
river
and
until
i
can
prove
that
i
am
not
guilty
or
until
they
let
me
off
of
their
own
free
wills
i
rather
stay
on
probation
but
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
mr
remsen
and
to
this
resolve
joel
adhered
despite
all
remsen
powers
of
persuasion
and
finally
that
gentleman
continued
on
his
way
to
the
office
looking
very
worried
the
cause
of
his
worry
was
known
to
the
whole
school
two
days
later
when
the
news
was
circulated
that
wesley
blair
was
on
probation
and
great
was
the
consternation
the
football
game
with
eustace
academy
was
fast
approaching
and
there
was
no
time
to
train
a
satisfactory
substitute
for
blair
position
at
even
had
one
been
in
reach
and
whipple
as
temporary
captain
was
well
enough
but
whipple
as
captain
during
the
big
game
was
not
to
be
thought
of
with
equanimity
the
backs
had
already
been
weakened
by
the
loss
of
cloud
who
despite
his
poor
showing
the
first
of
the
season
had
it
in
him
to
put
up
a
rattling
game
and
now
to
lose
blair
what
did
the
faculty
mean
did
it
want
hillton
to
lose
but
presently
hope
took
the
place
of
despair
among
the
pupils
he
was
going
to
coach
up
and
pass
a
special
exam
the
day
before
the
game
professor
ludlow
was
to
help
him
with
his
modern
languages
and
remsen
with
his
mathematics
while
digbee
that
confirmed
old
grind
had
offered
to
coach
him
on
greek
and
so
it
would
be
all
right
said
the
school
you
could
down
blair
he
pass
when
the
time
came
but
remsen
and
blair
himself
had
the
truth
been
known
were
not
so
hopeful
and
remsen
went
to
west
and
besought
him
to
induce
joel
to
allow
him
remsen
to
ask
for
his
reinstatement
and
this
west
very
readily
did
bringing
to
bear
a
whole
host
of
arguments
which
slid
off
from
joel
like
water
from
a
duck
back
and
remsen
groaned
and
shook
his
head
but
always
presented
a
smiling
cheerful
countenance
in
public
those
were
hard
days
for
the
first
eleven
despair
and
discouragement
threatened
on
all
sides
and
as
every
thoughtful
one
expected
there
was
such
a
slump
in
the
practice
as
kept
remsen
and
whipple
and
poor
blair
awake
o
nights
during
the
next
week
but
whipple
toiled
like
a
trojan
and
remsen
beamed
contentment
and
scattered
alternately
and
blair
ever
armed
with
a
watched
from
the
whenever
the
chance
offered
joel
seldom
went
to
the
field
those
days
the
sight
of
a
player
made
him
ready
to
weep
and
a
soaring
pigskin
sent
him
wandering
away
by
himself
along
the
river
bluff
in
no
enviable
state
of
mind
but
one
day
he
did
find
his
way
to
the
gridiron
during
practice
and
he
and
blair
sat
side
by
side
or
raced
down
the
field
even
with
a
runner
and
received
much
consolation
in
the
sort
of
company
that
misery
loves
and
deep
in
discussion
of
the
faults
and
virtues
of
the
players
forgot
their
troubles
why
it
would
have
mattered
if
you
were
playing
march
said
blair
for
there
no
harm
in
telling
you
now
that
we
were
depending
on
you
for
half
the
punting
remsen
thinks
you
are
fine
and
so
do
i
march
to
take
half
the
punting
off
your
hands
said
he
one
day
have
plenty
of
time
to
run
the
team
to
the
queen
taste
why
we
had
you
running
on
the
track
there
so
you
would
get
your
lungs
filled
out
and
be
able
to
run
with
the
ball
as
well
as
kick
it
if
you
were
playing
we
be
all
right
but
as
it
is
there
is
a
player
there
that
can
be
depended
on
to
punt
twenty
yards
if
pushed
some
of
ca
even
catch
the
ball
if
they
happen
to
see
the
line
breaking
eustace
is
eight
pounds
heavier
in
the
line
than
we
are
and
three
or
four
pounds
heavier
back
of
it
so
what
will
happen
why
they
get
the
ball
and
push
us
right
down
the
field
with
a
lot
of
measly
mass
plays
and
we
wo
be
able
to
kick
and
we
wo
be
able
to
go
through
their
line
and
dollars
to
doughnuts
that
we
wo
often
get
round
their
ends
it
a
hard
outlook
of
course
if
i
can
pass
but
there
blair
stopped
and
sighed
dolefully
and
joel
echoed
the
sigh
the
last
few
days
before
the
event
of
the
term
came
and
found
the
first
eleven
in
something
approaching
their
old
form
blair
continued
to
burn
the
midnight
oil
and
consume
page
after
page
of
greek
and
mathematics
and
german
which
as
he
confided
despondently
to
digbee
he
promptly
forgot
the
next
moment
remsen
made
up
a
certain
amount
of
lost
sleep
and
whipple
gained
the
confidence
of
the
team
joel
studied
hard
and
refound
his
old
interest
in
lessons
and
dreamed
nightly
of
the
goodwin
scholarship
west
too
put
in
some
hard
licks
as
he
phrased
it
and
found
himself
climbing
slowly
up
in
the
class
scale
and
so
the
day
of
the
game
came
round
the
night
preceding
it
two
things
of
interest
happened
the
eleven
and
substitutes
assembled
in
the
gymnasium
and
listened
to
a
talk
by
remsen
which
was
designed
less
for
instruction
than
to
take
the
boys
mind
off
the
morrow
game
and
wesley
blair
took
his
examination
in
the
four
neglected
studies
and
made
very
hard
work
of
it
and
finally
crawled
off
to
a
sleepless
night
leaving
the
professors
to
make
their
decision
alone
and
as
the
chapel
bell
began
to
ring
on
thanksgiving
day
morning
digbee
entered
blair
room
and
finding
that
youth
in
a
deep
slumber
sighed
wrote
a
few
words
on
a
sheet
of
paper
placed
this
in
plain
sight
upon
the
table
and
tiptoed
noiselessly
out
and
the
message
read
we
failed
on
the
greek
i
sorrier
than
i
can
tell
digbee
chapter
xiii
the
game
with
eustace
there
is
a
tradition
at
hillton
almost
as
firmly
inwrought
as
that
which
credits
professor
durkee
with
wearing
a
wig
to
the
effect
that
thanksgiving
day
is
always
rainy
proved
an
exception
to
the
rule
the
sun
shone
quite
warmly
and
scarce
a
cloud
was
to
be
seen
at
two
the
grand
stand
was
filled
and
late
arrivals
had
perforce
to
find
accommodations
on
the
grass
along
the
some
fifty
lads
had
accompanied
their
team
from
eustace
and
the
portion
of
the
stand
where
they
sat
was
blue
from
top
to
bottom
but
the
crimson
of
hillton
fluttered
and
waved
on
either
side
and
dotted
the
field
with
little
spots
of
vivid
color
wherever
a
hilltonian
youth
or
ally
sat
strolled
or
lay
yard
and
village
were
alike
deserted
here
was
the
staid
professor
the
corpulent
grocer
the
irrepressible
small
boy
the
senior
the
shouting
careless
junior
the
giggling
sister
the
smiling
mother
the
patronizing
papa
the
waitress
from
the
boarding
house
the
the
band
yes
by
all
means
the
band
there
was
no
chance
of
overlooking
the
band
it
stood
at
the
upper
end
of
the
field
and
played
and
played
and
played
the
band
never
did
things
by
halves
when
it
played
it
played
and
as
outfield
west
affirmed
it
played
till
the
cows
came
home
there
were
plenty
of
familiar
faces
here
professor
gibbs
old
duffy
professor
durkee
the
village
postmaster
old
joe
pike
and
many
many
others
on
the
ground
just
outside
the
rope
sat
west
and
a
throng
of
boys
from
hampton
house
there
were
cooke
and
cartwright
and
somers
and
digbee
and
yes
wesley
blair
looking
very
glum
and
unhappy
he
had
donned
his
football
clothes
perhaps
from
force
of
habit
and
sat
there
taking
little
part
in
the
conversation
but
studying
attentively
the
youths
who
were
on
the
gridiron
a
very
stalwart
lot
of
youngsters
those
same
youths
looked
to
be
and
handled
the
ball
as
though
to
the
manner
born
and
passed
and
fell
and
kicked
short
high
punts
with
discouraging
ease
and
vim
but
one
acquaintance
at
least
was
missing
not
bartlett
cloud
for
he
sat
with
his
sister
and
mother
on
the
seats
not
clausen
for
he
sat
among
the
substitutes
not
sproule
since
he
was
present
but
a
moment
since
but
joel
march
was
missing
in
his
room
at
masters
hall
joel
sat
by
the
table
with
a
greek
history
open
before
him
i
fear
he
was
doing
but
little
studying
for
now
and
then
he
arose
from
his
chair
walked
impatiently
to
the
window
from
which
he
could
see
in
the
distance
the
thronged
field
bright
with
life
and
color
turned
impatiently
away
sighed
and
so
returned
again
to
his
book
but
surely
we
can
not
tarry
there
with
joel
when
hillton
and
eustace
are
about
to
meet
in
gallant
if
bloodless
combat
on
the
campus
let
us
leave
him
to
sigh
and
sulk
and
return
to
the
gridiron
a
murmur
that
rapidly
grows
to
a
shout
arises
from
the
grand
stand
and
suddenly
every
eye
is
turned
up
the
river
path
toward
the
school
they
are
coming
a
little
band
of
knights
are
trotting
toward
the
campus
the
shouting
grows
in
volume
and
the
band
changes
its
tune
to
hilltonians
nearer
and
nearer
they
come
and
then
are
swinging
on
to
the
field
leaping
the
rope
and
throwing
aside
sweaters
and
coats
big
greer
is
in
the
lead
and
smiling
then
comes
whipple
then
warren
and
the
others
are
in
a
bunch
post
christie
fenton
littlefield
barnard
turner
cote
wills
the
eustace
contingent
gives
them
a
royal
welcome
and
west
and
cooke
and
somers
and
others
take
their
places
in
front
of
the
seats
and
lead
the
cheering
hillton
the
mighty
chorus
sweeps
across
the
campus
and
causes
more
than
one
player
heart
to
swell
within
him
saint
eustace
what
the
cheer
lacks
in
volume
is
atoned
for
by
good
will
and
a
clapping
of
hands
from
the
hostile
seats
attests
admiration
hillton
is
warming
for
the
fray
greer
and
whipple
are
practicing
the
latter
passing
the
ball
to
warren
who
seizes
it
and
runs
a
few
steps
to
a
new
position
where
the
play
is
repeated
the
guards
and
tackles
are
throwing
themselves
on
to
the
ground
and
clutching
rolling
footballs
in
a
way
that
draws
a
shudder
of
alarm
from
the
feminine
observer
stephen
remsen
is
talking
with
the
ends
very
earnestly
under
the
goal
posts
and
post
and
wills
are
aiming
balls
at
the
goal
with
it
must
be
acknowledged
small
success
then
a
whistle
blows
the
two
teams
congregate
in
the
center
of
the
field
the
opposing
captains
flip
a
coin
the
referee
a
yates
college
man
utters
a
few
words
of
warning
and
the
teams
separate
eustace
taking
the
ball
and
the
home
team
choosing
the
northern
goal
then
the
cheering
lessens
eustace
spreads
out
cantrell
their
center
places
the
ball
the
referee
whistle
sounds
the
pigskin
soars
aloft
and
the
game
is
on
in
charity
toward
hillton
let
us
pass
over
the
first
half
as
soon
as
may
be
suffice
to
tell
that
the
wearers
of
the
crimson
fought
their
best
that
whipple
ran
the
team
as
well
as
even
remsen
could
desire
that
post
made
a
startling
run
of
forty
yards
had
only
the
eustace
between
him
and
the
goal
and
then
ran
plump
into
that
arms
that
greer
and
barnard
and
littlefield
stood
like
a
stone
wall
and
went
down
like
one
that
wills
kicked
and
post
kicked
and
warren
kicked
and
none
of
them
accomplished
aught
save
to
wring
groans
from
the
souls
of
all
who
looked
on
in
short
it
was
eustace
half
from
to
call
of
time
and
all
because
hillton
had
never
a
youth
behind
the
line
to
kick
out
of
danger
or
gain
them
a
yard
for
eustace
was
heavier
in
the
line
than
hillton
and
heavier
back
of
it
and
with
the
ball
once
in
her
possession
eustace
had
only
to
hammer
away
at
center
guard
or
tackle
with
guards
back
or
tandem
to
score
eventually
and
that
is
what
she
did
and
yet
four
times
did
hillton
hold
eustace
literally
on
her
and
take
the
ball
and
each
time
by
hook
or
crook
by
a
short
weak
punt
or
a
clever
dashing
run
around
end
did
hillton
win
back
a
portion
of
her
lost
territory
only
to
lose
it
again
at
the
second
or
third
attempt
to
advance
the
ball
the
halves
were
minutes
long
and
in
that
first
minutes
eustace
scored
but
once
though
near
it
thrice
that
many
times
allen
eustace
right
had
plunged
over
the
line
for
a
at
the
end
of
fifteen
minutes
of
play
and
terrill
had
missed
an
easy
goal
then
the
grand
stand
was
silent
save
for
one
small
patch
whereon
blue
flags
went
crazy
and
swirled
and
leaped
and
danced
up
and
down
as
though
possessed
of
life
and
over
the
field
sped
sharp
and
triumphant
the
eustace
cheer
and
the
score
stood
eustace
hillton
o
the
first
half
ended
with
the
leather
but
ten
yards
from
the
north
goal
and
a
great
murmuring
sigh
of
relief
went
up
from
the
seats
and
from
along
the
when
the
whistle
sounded
then
the
hillton
players
pale
dirty
half
defeated
trotted
lamely
off
the
field
and
around
the
corner
of
the
stand
to
the
little
shed
which
served
for
dressing
room
and
the
team
trotted
joyfully
down
to
their
stage
and
there
behind
the
canvas
protections
were
rubbed
down
and
plastered
up
and
slapped
on
the
back
by
their
delighted
coach
and
trainer
in
the
hillton
quarters
life
was
less
cheerful
during
the
ten
minutes
of
intermission
after
the
fellows
had
rubbed
and
redressed
remsen
talked
for
a
minute
or
two
there
was
no
scolding
and
no
signs
of
either
disappointment
or
discouragement
but
he
cautioned
the
team
against
carelessness
predicted
a
tied
score
at
the
end
of
fifteen
minutes
and
called
for
for
hillton
which
was
given
with
reviving
enthusiasm
a
moment
later
the
team
trotted
back
to
the
field
touch
her
down
touch
her
down
touch
her
down
again
chanted
the
wearers
of
the
crimson
and
eustace
eustace
st
eustace
shouted
the
visitors
as
they
waved
their
bright
blue
banners
in
air
the
whistle
piped
merrily
the
ball
took
its
flight
and
it
was
now
or
never
for
old
hillton
stephen
remsen
joined
the
string
of
substitutes
and
found
a
seat
on
the
big
gray
blanket
which
held
browne
and
clausen
from
there
he
followed
the
progress
of
the
game
outwardly
he
was
as
happy
and
contented
as
cool
and
disinterested
as
one
of
the
goal
posts
inwardly
he
was
railing
against
the
fate
that
had
deprived
hillton
of
both
the
players
who
had
they
been
in
the
team
could
have
saved
the
crimson
from
defeat
wesley
blair
joined
him
and
with
scarce
a
word
they
watched
eustace
revert
to
her
previous
tactics
and
tear
great
gaping
holes
in
the
hillton
line
holes
often
large
enough
to
admit
of
a
coach
and
four
and
more
than
large
enough
to
allow
allen
or
jansen
to
go
tearing
galloping
through
with
the
ball
safe
clutched
for
three
five
or
even
a
dozen
yards
no
line
can
long
stand
such
treatment
and
while
the
greer
still
held
out
barnard
the
big
was
already
showing
signs
of
distress
eustace
next
play
was
a
small
wedge
on
tackle
and
although
barnard
threw
himself
with
all
his
remaining
strength
into
the
breach
he
was
tossed
aside
like
a
bag
of
feathers
and
through
went
the
right
and
left
followed
by
full
with
the
ball
and
pushed
onward
by
and
quarter
when
down
was
called
the
ball
was
eight
yards
nearer
goal
and
barnard
lay
still
on
the
ground
whipple
held
up
his
hand
thistelweight
a
youth
of
some
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds
struggled
agitatedly
with
his
sweater
and
bounded
into
the
field
and
barnard
white
and
weak
was
helped
limping
off
for
awhile
eustace
fought
shy
of
and
then
again
the
weight
of
all
the
backs
was
suddenly
massed
at
that
point
and
though
a
yard
resulted
the
crimson
wearers
found
cause
for
joy
and
a
ringing
cheer
swept
over
the
field
but
littlefield
at
was
also
weakening
and
the
tackle
beside
him
was
in
scarce
better
plight
and
so
with
tandem
on
tackle
wedge
or
guard
back
eustace
plowed
along
toward
the
hillton
goal
and
a
deep
silence
held
the
field
save
for
the
squad
of
cheerers
on
the
seats
remsen
looked
at
his
watch
eighteen
minutes
to
play
he
announced
quietly
blair
nodded
he
made
no
attempt
to
disguise
his
dejection
clausen
heard
and
suddenly
turned
toward
the
coach
he
was
pale
and
remsen
wondered
at
his
excitement
ca
we
tie
them
sir
he
asked
breathlessly
i
afraid
not
and
even
if
we
could
they
break
loose
clausen
paid
no
heed
to
the
sorry
joke
but
they
win
sir
is
there
anything
to
do
remsen
stared
then
he
smiled
failing
an
extraordinary
piece
of
luck
my
lad
already
beaten
our
line
ca
hold
them
we
have
no
one
to
kick
even
should
we
get
a
chance
and
but
if
blair
was
there
sir
or
march
it
might
make
a
difference
hello
there
they
go
through
hole
again
lord
six
yards
if
an
inch
blair
groaned
and
rolled
over
in
despair
the
whistle
sounded
and
as
the
pile
of
writhing
youths
dissolved
it
was
seen
that
tom
warren
was
hurt
out
trotted
the
rubber
the
players
sank
exhausted
to
the
ground
and
lay
stretched
upon
the
sward
puffing
and
panting
two
minutes
went
by
then
whipple
called
for
clausen
clausen
cried
remsen
turning
go
in
and
but
clausen
was
not
to
be
seen
clausen
cried
a
dozen
voices
there
was
no
response
and
browne
was
taken
on
instead
and
warren
with
an
ankle
that
failed
him
at
every
step
struggled
off
the
field
what
become
of
clausen
asked
remsen
but
no
one
could
answer
the
play
went
on
with
the
ball
on
hillton
line
a
fumble
gave
it
to
the
home
team
and
on
the
first
down
browne
gathered
it
in
his
arms
and
tried
to
skirt
eustace
left
end
but
was
thrown
with
a
loss
of
a
yard
a
similar
play
with
wills
as
the
runner
was
tried
around
the
other
end
and
netted
a
yard
and
a
half
it
was
the
third
down
and
four
and
a
half
yards
to
gain
back
went
the
ball
to
post
and
he
kicked
but
it
was
a
poor
performance
that
kick
and
only
drove
the
pigskin
down
the
to
the
line
where
it
bounded
in
touch
but
it
delayed
the
evil
moment
of
another
score
for
eustace
and
the
seats
cheered
twelve
minutes
left
announced
remsen
relentless
as
fate
the
eustace
forwards
surged
on
toward
the
opposing
goal
two
yards
three
yards
one
yard
five
yards
half
a
yard
always
a
gain
never
a
check
until
once
more
the
leather
reposed
just
in
front
of
the
hillton
goal
and
midway
between
the
ten
and
line
then
a
plunge
through
the
hole
followed
by
a
tandem
on
guard
and
another
five
yards
was
passed
the
cheering
from
the
wearers
of
the
blue
was
now
frantic
and
continuous
there
was
two
years
of
defeat
to
make
up
for
and
victory
was
hovering
over
the
azure
banner
eight
minutes
to
play
said
remsen
if
we
can
only
keep
them
from
scoring
again
suddenly
there
was
a
murmur
from
the
seats
then
a
cry
of
surprise
from
remsen
side
then
a
shout
of
exultation
that
gathered
and
grew
as
it
traveled
along
the
line
and
around
the
corner
of
the
stand
came
a
youth
who
strove
to
lace
his
torn
and
tattered
canvas
jacket
as
he
ran
remsen
leaped
to
his
feet
dropping
his
pipe
unnoticed
and
hastened
toward
him
they
met
and
for
a
moment
conversed
in
whispers
it
joel
march
cried
blair
he
going
to
play
exclaimed
a
dozen
voices
but
he
ca
cried
a
dozen
others
he
on
probation
he
is
he
is
he
going
on
he
going
to
play
and
so
he
was
whipple
had
already
seen
him
and
had
sunk
to
the
ground
nursing
an
ankle
which
had
suddenly
gone
lame
time
he
cried
and
obedient
to
his
demand
the
referee
whistle
piped
give
your
place
to
post
wills
he
commanded
and
then
limping
to
joel
he
led
that
youth
apart
can
you
play
he
asked
hoarsely
yes
then
get
in
there
at
and
o
march
kick
us
out
of
this
bloody
place
i
give
you
the
ball
on
the
next
down
kick
it
for
all
you
worth
he
gave
joel
a
shove
all
right
mr
referee
the
whistle
sounded
forward
charged
eustace
but
gathering
encouragement
from
the
knowledge
that
back
of
them
stood
a
full
who
would
put
them
out
of
danger
if
the
opportunity
were
given
him
hillton
stood
fast
second
down
five
yards
to
gain
cried
the
umpire
again
the
wearers
of
bedraggled
blue
stockings
surged
and
broke
against
the
line
and
again
there
was
no
gain
back
of
hillton
less
than
eight
yards
away
lay
the
desperation
lends
strength
huddled
together
shoulder
to
shoulder
the
backs
bracing
from
behind
the
youths
awaited
the
next
charge
it
was
the
thin
red
line
again
then
back
went
the
ball
there
was
a
moment
of
grinding
canvas
of
muttered
words
and
smothered
gasps
of
swaying
clutching
falling
and
down
was
heard
hillton
ball
first
down
announced
the
umpire
what
a
cheer
went
up
from
the
grand
stand
what
joy
was
in
heart
as
the
eustace
went
trotting
up
the
field
and
greer
stooped
over
the
ball
then
came
a
pause
a
silence
every
one
knew
what
to
look
for
squarely
between
the
posts
and
directly
under
the
stood
joel
march
his
left
foot
on
the
back
came
the
ball
straight
and
low
into
joel
outstretched
hands
the
line
blocked
long
and
hard
one
step
forward
an
easy
long
swing
of
his
right
leg
and
joel
sent
the
ball
sailing
a
yard
over
the
upstretched
hands
of
the
opposing
line
and
far
and
high
down
the
field
there
it
was
gathered
into
the
arms
of
the
eustace
but
ere
that
player
had
put
his
foot
twice
to
ground
he
was
thrown
and
the
teams
lined
up
on
eustace
line
then
it
was
that
the
god
of
battle
befriended
hillton
for
on
the
next
play
eustace
made
her
first
disastrous
fumble
and
christie
hillton
right
end
darted
through
seized
the
rolling
spheroid
and
started
down
the
field
five
ten
fifteen
twenty
yards
he
sped
the
eustace
backs
trailing
after
him
a
cried
remsen
no
the
half
gaining
he
got
him
no
missed
him
by
jove
the
run
was
over
and
christie
lay
panting
on
the
ground
with
the
triumphant
eustace
sitting
serenely
on
his
head
for
although
the
latter
had
missed
his
tackle
christie
had
slipped
in
avoiding
him
but
cheers
for
christie
and
hillton
filled
the
afternoon
air
and
the
two
elevens
lined
up
near
eustace
line
yet
well
over
toward
the
side
of
the
field
if
it
was
only
in
the
middle
of
the
field
groaned
blair
a
would
tie
the
score
how
much
time
is
there
mr
remsen
about
two
and
a
half
minutes
answered
remsen
but
i
an
idea
that
middle
or
no
middle
whipple
going
to
signal
a
kick
it
ca
be
done
answered
blair
with
conviction
drop
or
placement
march
is
only
fair
at
goals
and
at
that
angle
what
the
matter
with
the
man
cried
remsen
what
he
up
to
for
the
hillton
backs
were
clustered
well
up
behind
the
line
as
though
for
a
wedge
attack
and
as
remsen
wondered
the
ball
was
put
in
play
the
line
blocked
sharply
and
christie
left
his
place
at
right
end
and
skirting
behind
the
backs
received
the
ball
by
a
double
pass
right
and
ran
for
the
middle
of
the
field
the
backs
helping
the
end
and
tackle
to
hold
the
eustace
right
line
christie
gained
the
center
of
the
gridiron
and
advanced
a
yard
toward
the
opponent
goal
ere
the
eustace
right
reached
him
then
there
was
a
quick
and
joel
took
up
his
position
for
a
kick
well
done
whipple
cried
remsen
and
blair
in
a
breath
but
the
time
muttered
remsen
does
he
know
one
minute
to
play
came
the
ominous
announcement
then
while
a
snap
of
the
fingers
could
have
been
heard
the
length
of
the
field
whipple
glanced
deliberately
around
at
the
backs
slapped
the
broad
back
of
the
center
sharply
seized
the
snapped
ball
and
made
a
swift
straight
pass
to
joel
then
through
the
hillton
line
went
the
eustace
players
breaking
down
with
vigor
born
of
desperation
the
blocking
of
their
opponents
with
a
leap
into
the
air
the
eustace
bore
down
straight
upon
joel
there
was
a
concussion
and
the
latter
went
violently
to
earth
but
not
before
his
toe
had
met
the
rebounding
ball
and
the
latter
describing
a
high
arc
sailed
safely
cleanly
over
the
bar
and
between
the
posts
and
then
almost
before
the
ball
had
touched
the
ground
the
whistle
blew
shrilly
and
apparent
defeat
had
been
turned
into
what
was
as
good
as
victory
to
the
triumphant
wearers
of
the
hillton
crimson
hillton
and
eustace
had
played
a
tie
and
over
the
ropes
rushing
leaping
shouting
broke
the
tide
of
humanity
crimson
flags
swirled
over
a
sea
of
heads
and
pandemonium
ruled
the
campus
and
on
the
ground
where
he
had
fallen
lay
joel
march
chapter
xiv
the
goodwin
scholarship
but
how
did
it
all
happen
asked
outfield
west
breathlessly
he
had
just
entered
and
was
seated
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
whereon
joel
lay
propped
up
eating
his
thanksgiving
dinner
from
a
tray
it
was
seven
in
the
evening
and
dickey
sproule
was
not
yet
back
the
yard
was
noisy
with
the
shouts
of
lads
returning
from
the
dining
hall
and
an
occasional
cheer
floated
up
an
echo
of
the
afternoon
event
joel
moved
a
dish
of
pudding
away
from
outfield
elbow
as
he
answered
between
mouthfuls
of
turkey
i
was
up
here
studying
at
the
table
there
when
i
heard
some
one
coming
up
stairs
two
steps
at
a
time
it
was
clausen
he
threw
open
the
door
and
cried
winning

the
office
and
i
tell
everything
only
come
hurry
well
of
course
i
thought
first
he
was
crazy
then
i
guessed
what
was
up
because
i
knew
that
eustace
had
scored
you
could
have
known
you
were
studying
well
i
i
was
studying
all
the
time
out
so
up
i
jumped
and
we
raced
over
to
the
office
and
found
professor
wheeler
there
asleep
on
the
leather
couch
under
the
window
was
cloud
and
i
sir

with
it
sir
he
even
know
anything
about
it
sir
professor
wheeler
was
about
half
awake
and
he
thought
something
terrible
was
the
matter
and
it
took
the
longest
time
to
explain
what
clausen
was
talking
about
then
he
said
he
was
glad
to
learn
that
i
was
innocent
and
i
thanked
him
and
he
started
to
ask
clausen
a
lot
of
questions
eustace
is
winning
sir
i
cried
he
looked
at
me
in
astonishment
i
very
sorry
to
hear
it
he
said
it

too
late
now
sir
said
clausen
what

last
and

i
explain
to
the
faculty
and
by
the
way
march
remember
that
a
kick
into
touch
is
always
the
safest
is
he
a
rummy
old
guy
exclaimed
west
and
then
then
i
struck
out
for
the
gym
got
into
my
canvas
togs
somehow
or
other
and
reached
the
field
just
about
in
time
luckily
i
knew
the
signals
and
then
after
i
kicked
that
goal
that
big
eustace
chap
struck
me
like
a
locomotive
and
i
went
down
on
the
back
of
my
head
and
that
all
except
that
they
brought
me
up
here
and
professor
gibbs
plastered
me
up
and
gave
me
a
lot
of
nasty
sweet
water
to
take
and
clausen
from
the
little
i
heard
i
think
cloud
cut
the
rope
and
made
clausen
promise
not
to
tell
and
he
kept
his
promise
until
he
saw
hillton
getting
beaten
yesterday
and
then
he
could
stand
it
and
just
up
and
told
everything
and
saved
us
a
licking
did
i
tell
you
cloud
did
it
did
i
there
came
a
knock
on
the
door
and
in
response
to
joel
invitation
professor
wheeler
and
stephen
remsen
entered
west
leaped
off
the
bed
there
is
a
rule
at
hillton
forbidding
occupying
beds
save
for
sleep
and
upset
joel
tea
professor
wheeler
smiled
as
he
said
west
you
rather
an
uneasy
fellow
to
have
in
a
get
something
and
dry
that
off
the
floor
there
well
march
i
understand
you
got
there
in
the
nick
of
time
remsen
says
you
saved
us
from
defeat
indeed
he
did
professor
no
one
else
save
blair
could
have
done
it
that
goal
from
the
line
was
as
pretty
a
performance
as
i
ever
how
are
you
feeling
lad
all
right
answered
joel
i
got
a
bit
of
a
headache
but
i
be
better
in
the
morning
your
appetite
does
seem
to
have
failed
you
said
the
principal
no
sir
i
was
terribly
hungry
that
a
good
sign
they
west
you
may
take
your
seat
again
the
professor
and
stephen
remsen
occupied
the
two
chairs
and
west
without
hesitation
sat
down
again
on
the
bed
march
i
have
learned
the
truth
of
that
affair
bartlett
cloud
it
appears
cut
the
bell
rope
simply
in
order
to
throw
suspicion
on
you
he
managed
to
secure
a
letter
of
yours
through
hem
through
your
roommate
who
it
seems
also
bears
you
a
grudge
for
some
real
or
fancied
slight
clausen
while
a
party
to
the
affair
appears
to
have
taken
no
active
part
in
it
and
only
remained
silent
because
threatened
with
bodily
punishment
by
cloud
these
boys
will
be
dealt
with
as
they
deserve
but
i
wish
to
say
to
you
that
all
along
it
has
been
the
belief
of
the
faculty
the
entire
faculty
that
you
had
no
hand
in
the
matter
and
we
are
all
glad
to
have
our
judgments
vindicated
an
announcement
will
be
made
which
will
set
you
right
again
before
the
school
and
now
in
regard
to
richard
sproule
do
you
know
of
any
reason
why
he
should
wish
you
harm
no
sir
we
do
get
along
very
well
but
i
see
now
it
will
be
best
for
you
to
change
either
your
room
or
your
roommate
have
you
any
preference
which
you
do
i
should
like
to
change
my
room
sir
i
should
like
to
go
in
with
west
he
has
a
room
to
himself
in
hampton
and
wants
to
have
me
join
him
but
do
you
realize
that
the
rent
will
be
very
much
greater
march
yes
sir
but
west
wants
me
to
pay
only
what
i
have
paid
for
this
room
sir
he
says
he
have
to
pay
for
the
whole
room
if
i
did
go
in
with
him
and
so
it
fair
that
way
do
you
think
it
is
sir
what
would
your
father
say
west
i
asked
him
sir
he
says
to
go
ahead
and
do
as
i
please
the
principal
smiled
as
he
replied
well
march
then
move
over
to
west
room
it
will
be
all
fair
enough
and
i
shall
be
rather
glad
to
have
you
in
hampton
house
digbee
is
an
example
of
splendid
isolation
there
it
will
be
well
to
have
some
one
help
him
maintain
the
dignity
of
study
amid
such
a
number
of
er
well
say
lilies
of
the
field
west
they
toil
not
if
you
remember
and
neither
do
they
spin
do
get
up
in
the
morning
if
your
head
still
hurts
march
we
do
want
you
to
get
keep
a
watch
on
him
west
and
by
the
way
if
he
wants
more
tea

over
to
the
dining
hall
and
tell
the
steward
i
said
he
was
to
have
it
boys
sir
remsen
shook
hands
with
joel
march
i
hope
i
shall
be
able
to
repay
you
some
day
for
what
you
did
this
afternoon
it
meant
more
to
me
i
believe
than
it
did
to
even
you
fellows
i
going
thursday
next
come
and
see
me
before
then
if
you
can
when
the
door
had
closed
outfield
shouted
hurrah
in
three
different
keys
and
pirouetted
about
the
room
it
all
fixed
joel
welcome
to
hampton
my
lad
welcome
to
the
classic
shades
of
donothing
hall
we
will
live
on
pickles
and
and
feast
like
the
romans
of
old
we
he
paused
say
joel
i
guess
cloud
will
be
expelled
eh
joel
considered
thoughtfully
with
a
spoonful
of
rice
pudding
midway
between
saucer
and
mouth
then
he
swallowed
the
delicacy
yes
he
replied
and
i
awful
glad
of
it
but
joel
was
mistaken
for
cloud
was
not
to
be
found
the
next
morning
and
the
condition
of
his
room
pointed
to
hasty
flight
he
had
taken
alarm
and
saved
himself
from
the
degradation
of
public
dismissal
and
so
he
passed
from
hillton
life
and
was
known
there
no
more
clausen
escaped
with
a
light
punishment
for
which
both
joel
and
west
were
heartily
glad
because
when
you
get
him
away
from
cloud
said
west
not
a
bad
sort
you
know
richard
sproule
was
suspended
for
the
balance
of
the
fall
term
and
was
no
longer
monitor
of
his
floor
perhaps
the
heaviest
punishment
was
the
amount
of
study
he
was
required
to
do
in
order
to
return
after
christmas
recess
entailing
as
it
did
a
total
relinquishment
of
mayne
reid
scott
and
cooper
and
when
he
did
return
his
ways
led
far
from
joel
very
naturally
that
youth
had
now
risen
to
the
position
of
popular
hero
and
unapproachable
seniors
slapped
him
warmly
on
the
shoulder
a
bit
of
familiarity
joel
was
too
to
resent
and
little
juniors
admired
him
as
he
passed
them
but
joel
bore
himself
modestly
withal
and
was
in
no
danger
of
being
spoiled
by
a
state
of
things
that
might
well
have
turned
the
head
of
a
more
experienced
lad
than
he
it
is
a
question
if
outfield
did
not
derive
more
real
pleasure
and
pride
out
of
joel
popularity
than
did
joel
himself
every
new
evidence
of
the
liking
and
admiration
in
which
the
latter
was
held
filled
outfield
heart
with
joy
at
last
joel
found
time
to
begin
his
course
in
golf
and
almost
any
day
the
two
lads
might
have
been
seen
on
the
links
formidably
armed
with
a
confusing
assortment
of
clubs
outfield
quite
happy
to
be
exhibiting
the
science
of
his
favorite
sport
and
joel
plowing
up
the
sod
in
a
way
to
cause
a
had
there
been
such
a
person
on
hand
the
most
excruciating
pain
but
joel
went
at
golf
as
he
went
at
everything
else
bending
all
his
energies
thereto
and
driving
thought
of
all
else
from
his
mind
and
so
soon
became
if
not
an
expert
at
least
a
very
acceptable
player
who
won
commendation
from
even
west
and
where
golf
was
concerned
outfield
was
a
most
unbiased
and
unsympathetic
judge
one
afternoon
whipple
and
blair
the
latter
once
more
free
from
probation
played
a
match
with
joel
and
west
and
were
fairly
beaten
by
three
holes
a
fact
due
less
it
is
true
to
joel
execution
with
the
driver
than
west
playing
but
joel
nevertheless
derived
not
a
little
encouragement
from
that
result
and
bade
fair
to
become
almost
if
not
quite
as
enthusiastic
a
golfer
as
west
at
first
in
the
earlier
stages
of
his
initiation
joel
was
often
discouraged
whereupon
west
was
wont
to
repeat
the
famous
reply
of
the
old
andrews
player
to
the
college
professor
who
did
not
understand
why
when
he
could
teach
latin
and
greek
he
failed
so
dismally
at
golf
ay
i
ken
well
ye
can
teach
the
latin
and
greek
said
the
veteran
but
it
takes
mon
to
play
the
gowf
and
joel
more
than
half
agreed
with
him
remsen
departed
a
week
after
thanksgiving
being
accompanied
to
the
train
by
almost
as
enthusiastic
a
throng
as
had
welcomed
him
upon
his
arrival
he
had
consented
to
return
to
hillton
the
following
year
and
coach
the
eleven
once
more
i
had
expected
to
make
this
the
last
year
he
said
but
now
i
shall
coach
if
you
will
have
me
until
we
win
a
decisive
victory
from
eustace
i
ca
break
off
my
coaching
career
with
a
tie
game
you
see
and
christie
occasioned
laughter
and
applause
by
replying
i
afraid
you
putting
a
premium
on
defeat
sir
because
if
we
win
next
year
game
you
wo
come
back
he
shook
hands
cordially
with
joel
and
said
when
the
election
of
next
year
captain
comes
off
my
boy
it
a
pretty
sure
thing
that
you
have
a
chance
at
it
but
if
you
take
my
advice
you
let
it
alone
i
tell
you
this
because
i
your
friend
all
through
next
fall
will
be
time
enough
for
the
honors
this
year
should
go
to
hard
work
without
any
of
the
trouble
that
falls
to
the
lot
of
captain
thank
you
remsen
joel
answered
i
had
thought
of
their
doing
such
a
thing
i
do
see
why
they
should
want
me
but
if
it
offered
you
may
be
sure
i
decline
i
be
totally
unfitted
for
it
and
besides
i
have
got
the
time
and
so
when
two
weeks
later
the
election
was
held
in
the
gymnasium
one
evening
joel
did
decline
to
the
evident
regret
of
all
the
team
and
the
honor
went
to
christie
since
both
blair
and
whipple
were
seniors
and
would
not
be
in
school
the
next
autumn
and
christie
made
a
very
manly
earnest
speech
and
subsequently
called
for
three
times
three
for
blair
and
three
times
three
for
remsen
and
nine
times
three
for
hillton
all
of
which
were
given
with
a
will
as
the
christmas
recess
approached
joel
spent
a
great
deal
of
valuable
time
in
unnecessary
conjecture
as
to
his
chance
of
winning
the
goodwin
scholarship
and
undoubtedly
lessened
his
chance
of
success
by
worrying
the
winners
were
each
year
announced
in
school
hall
on
the
last
day
of
the
term
the
morning
of
that
day
found
outfield
west
very
busy
packing
a
heap
of
unnecessary
golf
clubs
and
wearing
apparel
into
his
trunk
and
bags
and
found
joel
seated
rather
despondently
on
the
lounge
looking
on
for
west
was
to
spend
his
vacation
with
an
uncle
in
boston
and
joel
although
outfield
had
begged
him
to
go
along
asserting
positively
that
his
uncle
would
be
proud
and
happy
to
see
him
joel
was
to
spend
the
recess
at
school
since
he
felt
he
could
not
afford
the
expense
of
the
trip
home
west
hesitated
long
over
a
waistcoat
and
at
length
sighed
and
left
it
out
is
it
most
time
to
go
over
asked
joel
no
do
you
be
in
a
hurry
there
a
half
hour
yet
and
if
going
to
get
the
goodwin
you
get
it
and
there
is
any
use
stewing
over
it
replied
west
severely
as
for
me
i
glad
i
not
a
grind
and
do
have
to
bother
my
head
about
such
tommyrot
just
sit
on
the
lid
of
this
pesky
thing
joel
will
you
i
afraid
that
last
coat
was
almost
too
much
for
it
but
even
suspense
comes
to
an
end
and
presently
joel
found
himself
seated
by
west
in
the
crowded
hall
and
felt
his
face
going
red
and
pale
by
turns
and
knew
that
his
heart
was
beating
with
unaccustomed
violence
beneath
his
shabby
vest
professor
wheeler
made
his
speech
and
what
a
long
one
it
seemed
to
many
a
lad
and
then
the
fateful
list
was
lifted
from
the
table
senior
class
scholarships
have
been
awarded
as
follows
announced
the
principal
the
calvin
scholarship
to
albert
park
digbee
waltham
massachusetts
joel
forgot
his
unpleasant
emotions
while
he
clapped
and
applauded
but
they
soon
returned
as
the
list
went
on
every
announcement
met
with
uproarous
commendation
and
boy
after
boy
arose
from
his
seat
and
more
or
less
awkwardly
bowed
his
recognition
the
principal
had
almost
completed
the
senior

joel
hands
were
cold
and
his
feet
just
would
keep
still
the
principal
leaned
down
and
took
up
the
upper
middle
class
list
west
nudged
joel
smartly
in
the
ribs
and
whispered
excitedly
now
keep
cool
my
boy
keep
cool
then
joel
heard
professor
wheeler
voice
reading
from
the
list
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
come
from
a
great
distance
upper
middle
class
scholarships
have
been
awarded
as
follows
there
was
a
pause
while
he
found
his
place
goodwin
scholarship
to
harold
burke
reeves
saginaw
michigan
west
subsided
in
his
seat
with
a
dismal
groan
joel
did
not
hear
it
it
is
doubtful
if
he
heard
anything
until
several
minutes
later
when
the
pronouncement
of
his
name
awoke
him
from
the
lethargy
into
which
he
had
fallen
masters
scholarships
to
joel
march
marchdale
maine
it
better
than
nothing
joel
whispered
outfield
it
fifty
dollars
you
know
but
joel
made
no
reply
what
was
a
masters
to
him
who
had
set
his
heart
on
the
first
prize
of
all
presently
when
the
lists
were
over
he
stole
quietly
out
unnoticed
by
his
chum
and
when
west
returned
to
the
room
he
found
joel
at
the
table
head
in
hands
an
open
book
before
him
west
closed
the
door
and
walked
noiselessly
forward
in
the
manner
of
one
in
a
at
length
he
asked
in
a
voice
which
strove
to
be
natural
and
unconcerned
what
are
you
doing
joel
the
head
over
the
book
only
bent
closer
as
its
owner
answered
doggedly
studying
greek
chapter
xv
the
boat
race
the
balance
of
that
school
year
was
a
season
of
hard
study
for
joel
it
was
not
in
his
nature
to
remain
long
despondent
over
the
loss
of
the
goodwin
scholarship
and
a
week
after
the
winter
term
commenced
he
was
as
cheerful
and
as
ever
but
his
failure
served
to
spur
him
on
to
renewed
endeavors
and
as
a
result
he
soon
found
himself
at
the
head
of
the
upper
middle
rightly
or
wrongly
and
there
is
much
to
be
said
on
both
sides
he
gave
up
sports
almost
entirely
now
and
then
west
persuaded
him
to
an
afternoon
on
the
links
but
this
was
infrequent
the
hockey
season
opened
with
the
first
hard
ice
on
the
river
and
west
joined
the
team
that
met
and
defeated
eustace
in
january
there
was
one
result
of
his
application
to
study
that
joel
had
not
looked
for
outfield
west
perhaps
from
a
mere
desire
to
be
companionable
took
to
lessons
and
much
to
his
own
pretended
dismay
began
to
earn
the
reputation
of
a
diligent
student
you
wo
talk
growled
west
you
wo
play
chess
you
wo
eat
things
you
just
drive
a
chap
to
study
as
spring
came
in
the
school
talk
turned
to
baseball
and
rowing
for
the
former
joel
had
little
desire
but
rowing
attracted
him
and
he
began
to
allow
himself
the
unusual
pleasure
of
an
hour
away
from
lessons
in
the
afternoon
that
he
might
go
down
to
the
boathouse
with
west
and
there
in
a
sunny
angle
of
the
building
watch
the
crews
at
work
upon
the
stream
hillton
was
trying
very
hard
to
turn
out
a
winning
crew
and
whipple
who
was
captain
of
the
first
eight
toiled
as
no
captain
had
toiled
before
in
the
history
of
hillton
aquatics
the
baseball
season
ended
disastrously
with
a
severe
drubbing
for
the
hillton
nine
at
the
hands
of
eustace
on
the
latter
home
ground
the
fellows
said
little
but
promised
to
atone
for
it
when
the
boat
race
came
off
this
occurred
two
days
before
class
day
which
this
year
came
on
june
and
very
nearly
every
pupil
traveled
down
the
river
to
marshall
to
witness
it
the
day
away
from
school
came
as
a
welcome
relief
after
the
worry
and
of
the
spring
examination
and
joel
although
he
knew
for
a
certainty
that
he
had
passed
with
the
highest
marks
was
glad
to
obey
outfield
stern
decree
and
accompany
that
youth
to
the
scene
of
the
race
they
went
by
train
and
arrived
at
the
little
town
at
noon
after
a
regal
repast
of
soup
and
sandwiches
ice
cream
and
chocolate
éclairs
the
two
set
out
for
the
river
side
the
hillton
crew
had
come
down
the
day
before
with
their
new
shell
and
had
spent
the
night
at
the
only
hotel
in
the
village
the
race
was
to
be
started
at
three
and
west
and
joel
spent
the
intervening
time
in
exploring
the
river
banks
for
a
mile
in
each
direction
from
the
bridge
and
in
getting
their
feet
wet
and
their
trousers
muddy
by
the
hour
set
for
the
start
the
river
sides
were
thronged
with
spectators
and
rival
cheers
floated
across
the
sparkling
stream
from
bank
to
bank
that
side
of
the
river
whereon
eustace
academy
lies
hidden
behind
a
hill
held
the
eustace
supporters
while
upon
the
other
bank
the
hillton
lads
and
their
friends
congregated
but
the
long
bridge
something
more
than
a
mile
below
was
common
ground
and
here
the
foes
mingled
and
strove
to
outshout
each
other
the
river
is
broad
here
below
marshall
and
forms
what
is
almost
a
basin
hemmed
in
on
either
side
by
low
wooded
bluffs
from
where
joel
and
west
with
a
crowd
of
hillton
fellows
stood
midway
upon
the
bridge
the
starting
point
nearly
a
mile
and
a
half
up
stream
was
plainly
visible
and
the
finish
line
was
a
few
rods
above
them
west
was
acquainted
with
several
of
the
eustace
boys
and
to
these
joel
was
introduced
and
was
welcomed
by
them
with
much
cordiality
and
examined
with
some
curiosity
he
had
accomplished
the
defeat
of
their
eleven
and
they
would
know
what
sort
of
youth
he
was
while
they
were
talking
leaning
against
the
railing
of
the
bridge
joel
suddenly
caught
west
arm
and
drew
his
attention
to
a
boy
some
distance
away
who
was
looking
toward
the
starting
point
through
a
pair
of
field
glasses
west
indulged
in
a
long
whistle
plainly
indicative
of
amazement
who
that
fellow
over
there
he
asked
one
of
the
eustace
boys
followed
the
direction
of
his
gaze
well
you
ought
to
know
him
he
knows
you
that
bartlett
cloud
he
was
at
hillton
last
term
and
left
because
he
was
put
off
the
eleven
or
so
he
says
humph
ejaculated
outfield
west
he
left
to
keep
from
being
expelled
he
did
he
left
because
he
was
mixed
up
in
some
mighty
dirty
work
and
knew
that
even
if
they
let
him
stay
in
school
no
decent
fellow
would
associate
with
him
and
you
can
tell
him
from
me
that
if
he
says
i
know
him
he
a
liar
i
do
know
him
from
from
mud
i
should
think
you
be
proud
of
him
at
eustace
we
did
know
that
answered
the
eustace
boy
in
perplexity
we
thought
what
demanded
west
as
the
other
paused
well
he
said
that
the
coach
was
down
on
him
and
gave
his
place
to
your
friend
here
and
no
answered
joel
quietly
i
did
take
his
place
he
tried
to
strike
me
one
day
at
practice
and
remsen
our
coach
put
him
off
that
was
all
afterward
he
he
but
it
is
worth
talking
about
but
i
did
know
that
eustace
made
a
practice
of
taking
in
scamps
from
other
schools
said
west
the
other
lad
flushed
as
he
answered
apologetically
we
did
know
west
he
said
he
was
a
friend
of
yours
and
so
but
the
other
fellows
shall
know
about
him
then
there
was
a
stir
on
the
bridge
and
a
voice
cried
there
they
go
to
the
float
up
the
stream
at
the
starting
point
two
shells
were
seen
leisurely
paddling
toward
a
float
anchored
a
few
yards
off
the
right
bank
the
colors
were
easily
distinguishable
and
especially
did
the
crimson
of
hillton
show
up
to
the
eager
watchers
on
the
bridge
every
eye
was
turned
toward
the
two
boats
and
a
silence
held
the
throng
a
silence
which
lasted
until
sixteen
caught
the
water
almost
together
and
the
two
boats
began
to
leave
the
float
behind
then
cries
of
they
off
were
raised
and
there
was
a
general
shoving
and
pushing
for
places
of
observation
on
the
side
of
the
structure
while
along
the
banks
the
crowds
began
to
move
about
again
it
was
joel
first
sight
of
a
boat
race
and
he
found
himself
becoming
very
excited
while
west
veteran
though
he
was
breathed
a
deal
faster
and
talked
in
disjointed
monosyllables
side
by
side
no
hillton
ahead
is
she
eh
you
ca
see
from
here
which
is
leading
get
another
hold
on
my
arm
joel
that
one
black
and
blue
ahead
hillton
ahead
by
a
half
length
but
she
was
side
by
side
the
two
shells
swept
on
toward
the
first
mark
they
were
both
rowing
steadily
with
no
endeavor
to
draw
away
hillton
at
thirty
strokes
eustace
at
the
course
was
two
miles
almost
straight
away
down
the
river
the
buoy
was
not
distinguishable
from
where
joel
stood
but
the
mile
was
plainly
in
sight
some
one
who
held
a
behind
joel
uttered
an
impatient
growl
at
the
slow
time
the
crews
were
making
there
be
no
record
broken
he
said
they
eight
seconds
behind
already
for
the
first
quarter
but
joel
did
care
about
that
if
only
those
eight
swaying
forms
might
pass
first
beyond
the
finish
line
he
cared
but
little
what
the
time
might
be
the
cheering
which
had
ceased
as
the
boats
left
the
start
now
began
again
as
they
approached
the
finish
of
the
first
quarter
of
the
course
hillton
rang
out
from
the
right
bank
s
e
a
s

a
s
e
a
saint
eustace
replied
the
left
bank
with
a
defiant
roar
of
sound
that
was
caught
by
the
hills
and
flung
back
in
echoes
across
the
water
saint
eustace

hillton
then
the
cheering
grew
louder
and
more
frenzied
as
boat
to
boat
the
rival
eights
passed
the
buoy
swinging
along
with
no
perceptible
effort
over
the
blue
dancing
water
anybody
race
said
outfield
west
as
he
lowered
his
glasses
but
hillton
got
the
outside
course
on
the
turn
the
turn
was
no
more
than
a
slight
divergence
from
the
straight
line
at
the
mark
but
it
might
mean
from
a
half
to
three
quarters
of
a
length
to
the
outside
boat
should
they
maintain
their
present
relative
positions
for
the
next
half
mile
the
same
moderate
strokes
were
used
until
the
buoy
was
almost
reached
when
hillton
struck
up
to
and
then
to
and
eustace
increased
her
stroke
to
the
latter
number
it
was
a
race
for
the
position
nearest
the
buoy
and
eustace
won
it
hillton
falling
back
a
half
length
as
the
course
was
changed
then
the
strokes
in
both
boats
went
back
to
hillton
seemingly
willing
to
keep
in
the
rear
on
and
on
they
came
the
oars
taking
the
water
in
unison
and
shining
like
silver
when
the
sun
caught
the
wet
blades
and
back
the
wakes
seemed
like
two
ruled
marks
so
straight
they
were
there
was
no
let
up
of
the
cheering
now
back
and
forth
went
challenge
and
reply
across
the
stream
while
the
watchers
on
the
bridge
fairly
shook
that
structure
with
the
fury
of
their
slogans
as
the
boats
neared
the
buoy
it
was
plain
to
all
who
looked
that
the
real
race
was
yet
to
come
hillton
suddenly
hit
up
her
stroke
to
to
to
and
a
bit
ragged
perhaps
but
nevertheless
at
a
beautiful
speed
drew
up
to
eustace
shoved
her
nose
a
quarter
length
past
and
hung
there
despite
eustace
best
efforts
to
shake
her
off
both
boats
were
now
straining
their
uttermost
and
from
now
on
to
the
finish
it
was
to
be
the
stiffest
rowing
of
which
each
was
capable
hillton
ragged
on
the
port
side
and
bow
was
plainly
tuckered
but
eustace
also
showed
signs
of
wear
and
there
was
an
evident
disposition
the
length
of
the
boat
to
hurry
through
the
stroke
joel
was
straining
his
eyes
on
the
crimson
backs
and
west
was
vainly
and
unconsciously
endeavoring
to
see
through
the
glasses
from
the
wrong
end
the
mark
swept
past
the
boats
and
hillton
still
maintained
her
lead
the
judges
boat
a
tiny
saucy
naphtha
launch
had
steamed
down
to
the
finish
and
now
quivered
there
as
though
from
impatience
and
excitement
and
awaited
the
victor
suddenly
there
was
a
groan
of
dismay
from
the
eustace
supporters
and
no
wonder
their
boat
had
suddenly
dropped
behind
until
its
nose
was
barely
lapping
the
rival
shell
number
four
was
rowing
out
of
time
and
tune
as
joel
shouted
triumphantly
and
although
he
soon
steadied
down
the
damage
was
hard
to
repair
for
hillton
encouraged
by
the
added
lead
was
rowing
magnificently
but
with
strokes
that
brought
cries
of
admiration
even
from
her
foes
eustace
struggled
gloriously
to
recover
her
lost
water
little
by
little
the
nose
of
her
boat
crept
up
and
up
until
it
was
almost
abreast
with
number
three
oar
while
cries
of
encouragement
from
bridge
and
shore
urged
her
on
but
now
green
the
hillton
coxswain
turned
his
head
slightly
studied
the
position
of
the
rival
eight
glanced
ahead
at
the
judges
boat
and
spoke
a
short
sharp
command
and
instantly
ragged
port
oars
notwithstanding
the
crimson
crew
seemed
to
lift
their
boat
from
the
water
at
every
stroke
and
eustace
struggling
gamely
heroically
to
the
last
moment
fell
farther
and
farther
behind
a
half
length
of
clear
water
showed
between
them
then
a
length
then
and
now
the
line
was
but
a
away
two
fair
lengths
separated
the
contestants
and
amid
the
deafening
frenzied
shrieks
of
their
schoolmates
their
backs
rising
and
falling
like
all
signs
of
raggedness
gone
the
eight
heroes
swept
over
the
line
winners
by
two
and
a
half
lengths
from
the
eustace
crew
and
disappeared
under
the
bridge
to
emerge
on
the
other
side
with
trailing
oars
and
wearied
limbs
and
as
they
went
from
sight
joel
stooping
yelling
over
the
railing
saw
with
the
piercing
shriek
of
the
launch
whistle
in
his
ears
the
upraised
face
of
green
the
coxswain
smiling
placidly
up
at

chapter

to

joel
took
the
preliminary
examination
for
harwell
university
in
june
and
left
class
day
morning
for
home
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
his
name
in
the
list
of
honor
men
for
the
year
having
attained
a
or
b
in
all
studies
for
the
three
terms
the
parting
with
outfield
west
was
shorn
of
much
of
its
melancholy
by
reason
of
the
latter
promise
to
visit
joel
in
august
the
suggestion
had
been
made
by
outfield
and
joel
had
at
once
warmly
pressed
him
to
come
only
you
know
out
joel
had
said
we
do
live
in
much
style
and
i
have
to
work
a
good
deal
so
there
wo
be
much
time
for
fun
what
do
you
have
to
do
asked
west
well
milk
and
go
to
mill
and
perhaps
there
will
be
threshing
to
do
before
i
leave
and
then
there
lots
of
other
little
things
around
the
farm
that
i
generally
do
when
i
home
that
all
right
answered
west
cheerfully
i
help
i
milked
a
cow
once
only
say
what
do
you
hit
a
cow
with
when
you
milk
her
i
do
hit
her
at
all
laughed
joel
do
you
i
i
hit
her
with
a
plank
and
she
up
and
kicked
me
eight
times
before
i
could
move
off
perhaps
i
riled
her
i
thought
you
should
always
hit
them
before
you
begin
joel
had
not
seen
his
parents
since
he
had
left
home
in
the
preceding
fall
and
naturally
a
warm
welcome
awaited
him
march
to
relief
did
not
appear
to
regret
the
loss
of
the
goodwin
scholarship
nearly
as
much
as
joel
himself
had
done
and
seemed
rather
proud
than
otherwise
of
the
lad
first
year
at
the
academy
in
august
outfield
west
descended
at
the
little
station
accompanied
by
two
trunks
a
a
photograph
camera
and
a
case
and
farmer
march
regarded
the
pile
of
luggage
apprehensively
and
undoubtedly
thought
many
unflattering
thoughts
of
west
but
as
no
one
could
withstand
that
youth
for
long
at
the
end
of
three
days
both
joel
father
and
mother
had
accepted
him
unreservedly
into
their
hearts
as
for
joel
brother
ezra
and
his
sister
they
had
never
hesitated
for
a
single
instant
march
absolutely
forbade
joel
from
doing
any
of
the
chores
after
west
arrived
at
the
farm
and
sent
the
boys
off
on
a
week
hunting
and
fishing
excursion
with
black
betty
and
the
democrat
wagon
west
took
his
camera
along
but
was
prevailed
on
to
leave
his
golf
clubs
at
the
farm
and
the
two
had
eight
days
of
ideal
fun
in
the
maine
woods
and
returned
home
with
marvelous
stories
of
adventure
and
a
goodly
store
of
game
and
fish
west
was
somewhat
disappointed
in
the
golfing
facilities
afforded
by
the
country
about
marchdale
but
politely
refrained
from
allowing
the
fact
to
be
known
by
joel
outside
of
the
pasture
and
the
the
ground
was
too
rocky
and
broken
to
make
driving
a
pleasure
and
after
losing
half
a
dozen
balls
outfield
restricted
himself
to
the
pasture
where
he
created
intense
interest
on
the
part
of
the
cows
he
found
that
he
got
along
much
more
peaceably
with
them
when
he
appeared
without
his
red
coat
in
september
happy
healthy
and
well
browned
the
two
boys
returned
to
hillton
with
all
the
dignity
becoming
the
reverend
senior
west
had
abandoned
his
original
intention
of
entering
yates
college
and
had
taken
with
joel
the
preliminary
examination
for
harwell
and
they
were
full
of
great
plans
for
the
future
and
spent
whole
hours
telling
each
other
what
marvelous
things
awaited
them
at
the
university
joel
senior
year
at
hillton
was
crowded
with
hard
work
and
filled
with
incident
but
as
it
was
more
or
less
a
repetition
of
the
preceding
year
it
must
needs
be
told
of
briefly
if
space
permitted
i
should
like
to
tell
of
joel
first
debate
in
the
senior
debating
society
in
which
he
proved
conclusively
and
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
present
that
the
political
privileges
of
a
citizen
of
athens
under
the
constitution
of
cleisthenes
were
far
superior
to
those
of
a
citizen
of
rome
at
the
time
of
the
second
punic
war
and
i
should
like
to
tell
of
the
arduous
training
on
the
football
field
and
in
the
gymnasium
by
means
of
which
joel
increased
his
sphere
of
usefulness
on
the
eleven
and
learned
to
run
with
the
ball
as
well
as
kick
it
so
proving
the
truth
of
an
assertion
made
by
stephen
remsen
who
had
said
with
such
long
legs
as
those
march
you
should
be
as
fine
a
runner
as
you
are
a
kicker
and
i
should
like
to
go
into
tiresome
detail
over
the
game
with
eustace
in
which
joel
made
no
star
plays
but
worked
well
and
steadily
at
the
position
of
left
and
thereby
aided
in
the
decisive
victory
for
hillton
that
remsen
had
spoken
of
for
the
score
at
the
end
of
the
first
half
was
hillton
eustace
and
at
the
end
of
the
game
hillton
eustace
joel
and
remsen
became
fast
and
familiar
friends
during
that
term
and
when
a
few
days
after
the
eustace
game
remsen
took
his
departure
from
the
academy
no
more
to
coach
the
teams
to
glorious
victory
or
honorable
defeat
joel
of
all
the
school
was
perhaps
the
sorriest
to
have
him
go
but
remsen
spoke
hopefully
of
future
meetings
at
harwell
and
joel
and
west
waved
him
farewell
from
the
station
platform
and
walked
back
to
the
yard
in
the
manner
of
chief
mourners
at
a
funeral
outfield
west
again
emerged
triumphant
from
the
golf
tournament
and
the
little
pewter
mug
remained
securely
upon
his
mantel
a
receptacle
for
damaged
balls
for
some
time
the
two
missed
the
familiar
faces
of
digbee
and
blair
and
whipple
and
some
few
others
somers
and
cooke
still
remained
the
latter
with
radiant
hopes
of
graduation
the
coming
june
the
former
to
take
advanced
courses
in
several
studies
clausen
was
a
frequent
visitor
to
number
four
hampton
and
both
west
and
joel
had
conceived
a
liking
for
him
which
as
the
year
went
by
grew
into
sincere
friendship
those
who
had
been
intimate
with
wallace
clausen
when
he
was
under
the
influence
of
bartlett
cloud
saw
a
great
difference
in
the
lad
at
this
period
he
had
grown
manlier
more
earnest
in
tone
and
attainments
and
had
apparently
shaken
off
his
old
habit
of
weak
carelessness
as
some
insects
shed
their
skins
he
too
was
to
enter
harwell
the
coming
fall
a
fact
which
strengthened
the
bond
between
the
three
youths
one
resolve
was
uppermost
in
joel
heart
when
he
began
his
last
year
at
hillton
and
that
was
to
gain
the
goodwin
scholarship
his
failure
the
year
before
had
only
strengthened
his
determination
to
win
this
time
and
win
he
did
and
was
a
very
proud
and
happy
lad
when
the
lists
were
read
and
the
name
of
joel
march
marchdale
maine
led
all
the
rest
and
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
there
was
much
happiness
in
the
great
rambling
farmhouse
up
north
when
joel
telegram
was
received
for
joel
could
not
wait
for
the
mail
to
carry
the
good
news
but
must
needs
run
at
once
to
the
village
and
spend
a
bit
of
his
prospective
fortune
on
a
night
message
despite
this
fortune
of
two
hundred
and
forty
dollars
joel
elected
to
spend
his
christmas
holidays
again
at
hillton
and
outfield
when
he
learned
of
the
intention
declined
his
uncle
invitation
and
remained
also
the
days
passed
quickly
and
merrily
there
was
excellent
skating
on
the
river
and
joel
showed
west
the
methods
of

with

small
results

found
joel
with
two
honor
terms
behind
him
and
as
sure
as
might
be
of
passing
his
final
examination
for
college
again
in
june
eustace
and
hillton
met
on
the
river
and
as
though
to
atone
for
her
defeat
on
the
gridiron
fate
gave
the
victory
to
eustace
the
wearers
of
the
blue
crossing
the
finish
a
full
length
ahead
of
the
hillton
eight
the
baseball
team
journeyed
down
to
marshall
and
won
by
an
overwhelming
majority
of
runs
and
journeyed
home
again
in
the
still
of
a
june
evening
bringing
another
soiled
and
battered
ball
to
place
in
the
trophy
case
of
the
gymnasium
and
finally
one
bright
day
in
early
summer
joel
put
on
his
best
clothes
and
accompanied
by
west
and
clausen
took
his
way
to
the
chapel
where
amid
an
eloquent
silence
professor
wheeler
made
his
farewell
address
and
old
temple
preached
the
valedictory
sermon
then
the
diplomas
were
presented
and
save
for
the
senior

exercises
in
the
school
hall
in
the
afternoon
class
day
was
over
and
joel
march
school
days
were
past
joel
was
graduated
at
the
head
of
the

an
honor
man
once

and
outfield

greatly
to
every
one
amazement
not
excepting
his
own
was
also
on
the
honor
list
cooke
passed
at

and
later
confided
to
west
that
he
did
know
what
he
do
now
that
they
would
let
him
stay
longer
at

he
was
certain
he
would
feel
terribly
homesick
at
harwell
west
playfully
suggested
that
he
stay
at
hillton
and
take
an
advanced
course
and
cooke
seemed
quite
in
the
notion
until
he
found
that
he
would
be
obliged
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
both
livy
and
horace
a
lad
can
not
stay
two
years
at
a
school
without
becoming
deeply
attached
to
it
and
both
joel
and
west
took
their
departures
from
hillton
feeling
very
melancholy
as
the
wooded
hill
crowned
by
the
tower
faded
from
sight
west
went
directly
to
his
home
although
joel
had
tried
to
persuade
him
to
visit
at
marchdale
for
a
few
weeks
in
july
joel
received
a
letter
from
outfield
asking
him
to
visit
him
in
iowa
and
at
the
solicitation
of
his
parents
he
decided
to
accept
the
invitation
the
west
was
terra
incognita
to
joel
and
he
found
much
to
interest
and
puzzle
him
the
methods
of
farming
were
so
different
from
those
to
which
he
had
been
accustomed
that
he
spent
the
first
week
of
his
stay
in
trying
to
revolutionize
them
much
to
the
amusement
of
both
outfield
and
his
father
he
at
length
learned
that
eastern
ways
are
not
western
ways
and
so
became
content
to
see
wheat
harvested
by
machinery
and
corn
cultivated
with
strange
new
implements
he
received
one
day
a
letter
forwarded
from
marchdale
which
bore
the
signature
of
the
captain
of
the
harwell
varsity
football
eleven
it
asked
him
to
keep
in
practice
during
the
summer
and
if
convenient
to
report
on
the
field
two
days
before
the
commencement
of
the
term
remsen
name
was
mentioned
and
joel
knew
that
he
had
him
to
thank
for
the
letter
the
friends
had
decided
to
take
a
room
together
and
had
applied
for
one
in
the
spring
much
to
their
gratification
they
were
given
a
third
floor
room
in
mayer
one
of
the
best
of
the
older
college
dormitories
when
the
time
came
for
going
east
both
west
and
joel
were
impatient
to
be
on
the
way
west
accompanied
the
boys
and
the
little
party
reached
the
old
college
town
four
days
before
the
opening
of
the
term
agreeably
to
the
request
of
the
football
captain
joel
reported
on
the
field
in
football
togs
the
day
after
reaching
town
and
was
given
a
cordial
welcome
captain
button
was
not
there
but
returned
with
the
varsity
squad
from
a
week
practice
at
a
neighboring
village
two
days
later
west
meanwhile
toiled
ceaselessly
at
furnishing
the
boys
room
and
the
result
was
a
revelation
to
joel
to
whom
luxurious
lounges
and
chairs
and
attractive
engravings
were
things
hitherto
admired
and
longed
for
from
a
distance
and
then
bidding
a
farewell
to
the
lads
outfield
mother
took
her
departure
for
home
and
they
were
left
practically
rulers
of
all
they
surveyed
and
if
the
truth
were
told
a
trifle
sobered
by
the
suddenness
of
their
plunge
into
independence
and
one
warm
september
day
the
college
bell
rang
for
chapel
and
the
two
lads
had
begun
a
new
important
and
to
them
exciting
chapter
of
their
lives

picture
a
mild
golden
afternoon
in
early
october
the
yellowing
green
of
sailors
field
mellow
and
warm
in
the
sunlight
the
river
winding
its
sluggish
way
through
the
broad
level
marshes
like
a
ribbon
of
molten
gold
and
the
few
great
fleecy
bundles
of
white
clouds
sailing
across
the
deep

of
the
sky

a
little
distance
from
where
to
and
fro
walking
trotting
darting

ever
moving
like
the
particles
in
a
kaleidoscope
many
squads
of
players
were
practicing
on
the
football
field
such
then
is
the
picture
that
would
have
rewarded
your
gaze
had
you
passed
through
the
gate
and
stood
near
the
simple
granite
shaft
which
rises
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
to
commemorate
the
little
handful
of
names
it
bears
had
you
gone
on
across
the
intervening
turf
until
the
lengthened
shadow
of
the
nearest
goal
post
was
reached
you
would
have
seen
first
a
squad
a
veritable
awkward
squad
arranged
in
a
ragged
circle
and
passing
a
football
with
much
mishandling
and
many
fumbles
further
along
you
would
have
seen
a
long
line
of
youths
standing
their
general
expression
was
one
of
alertness
bordering
on
alarm
the
casual
observer
would
have
thought
each
and
every
one
insane
as
suddenly
darting
from
the
line
one
after
another
they
flung
themselves
upon
the
ground
rolled
frantically
about
as
though
in
spasms
and
then
arose
and
went
back
into
the
rank
but
had
you
observed
carefully
you
would
have
noticed
that
each
spasm
was
caused
by
a
rolling
ball
wobbling
its
erratic
way
across
the
turf
before
them
around
about
in
and
out
forms
darted
after
descending
spheroids
or
seized
a
ball
from
outstretched
hands
started
desperately
into
motion
charged
a
few
yards
and
then
as
though
reconsidering
turned
and
trotted
back
only
to
repeat
the
performance
the
next
moment
and
footballs
banged
against
broad
backs
with
hollow
sounds
or
rolled
about
between
stoutly
clad
feet
or
ascended
into
the
air
in
great
arching
flights
and
a
babel
of
voices
was
on
all
sides
cries
of
warning
sharp
commands
scathing
denouncements

the
period
was
that
exasperating
one
known
as
the
first
two
weeks
when
coaches
are
continually
upon
the
border
of
insanity
and
players
wonder
dumbly
if
the
game
is
worth
the
candle
joel
one
of
a
squad
of
unfortunates
was
relearning
the
art
of
tackling
it
was
first
experience
with
that
marvelous
contrivance
the
dummy
one
after
another
the
squad
was
sent
at
a
sharp
spurt
to
grapple
the
inanimate
bag
hanging
inoffensively
there
like
a
body
from
a
gallows
between
the
uprights
there
are
supposed
to
be
two
ways
to
tackle
but
the
coach
who
was
conducting
the
operations
undoubtedly
believed
in
the
existence
of
at
least
thrice
that
number
for
each
candidate
for
varsity
honors
tackled
the
dummy
in
a
totally
different
style
the
lift
tackle
is
performed
by
seizing
the
opponent
around
the
legs
below
the
hips
bringing
his
knees
together
so
that
further
locomotion
is
an
impossibility
to
him
and
lifting
him
upward
off
the
ground
and
depositing
him
as
far
backward
toward
his
own
goal
as
circumstances
and
ability
will
permit
the
lift
tackle
is
the
easiest
to
make
the
dive
tackle
pertains
to
swimming
and
suicide
running
toward
the
opponent
the
tackler
leaves
the
ground
when
at
a
distance
of
a
length
and
a
half
and
dives
at
the
runner
aiming
to
tackle
a
few
inches
below
the
hips
a
dive
tackle
well
done
always
accomplishes
a
pause
in
the
runner
progress
joel
was
having
hard
work
of
it
time
and
again
he
launched
himself
at
the
swaying
legs
bringing
the
canvas
man
to
earth
but
always
picking
himself
up
to
find
the
coach
observing
him
very
very
coldly
and
to
hear
that
exasperating
gentleman
ask
sarcastically
if
he
joel
thinks
he
is
playing
squat
tag
and
then
the
dummy
would
swing
back
into
place
harboring
no
malice
or
resentment
for
the
rough
handling
and
joel
would
take
his
place
once
more
and
watch
the
next
man
attempt
finding
i
fear
some
consolation
in
the
roast
accorded
to
the
latter
it
was
toward
the
latter
part
of
the
second
week
of
college
joel
had
practiced
every
day
except
sundays
and
had
just
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
football
as
played
at
harwell
was
no
relation
not
even
a
distant
cousin
to
the
game
of
a
similar
name
played
at
hillton
of
course
he
was
wrong
since
intercollegiate
football
whether
played
by
schoolboys
or
college
students
is
still
intercollegiate
football
the
difference
lies
only
in
the
state
of
development
at
hillton
the
game
very
properly
was
restricted
to
its
more
primary
methods
at
harwell
it
is
developed
to
its
uttermost
limits
it
is
the
difference
between
whist
over
the
library
table
and
whist
at
the
whist
club
but
all
things
come
to
an
end
and
at
length
the
coach
rather
ungraciously
declared
he
could
stand
no
more
and
bade
them
join
the
rest
of
the
candidates
for
the
run
that
run
was
two
miles
and
joel
finally
stumbled
into
the
gymnasium
tuckered
out
and
in
no
very
good
temper
just
as
the
five
whistle
on
the
great
printing
house
sounded
after
dinner
in
the
dining
hall
that
evening
joel
confided
his
doubts
and
vexations
to
outfield
as
they
walked
back
to
their
room
i
care
if
i
thought
i
was
making
any
progress
he
wailed
but
each
day
it
gets
worse
i
could
seem
to
do
a
start
right
and
as
for
tackling
that
old
dummy
why
well
you
did
as
well
as
the
other
chaps
did
you
asked
outfield
i
suppose
so
he
gave
it
to
us
all
impartially
well
there
you
are
he
ca
tell
you
you
the
finest
young
tacklers
that
ever
happened
because
you
all
get
swelled
craniums
and
not
do
another
lick
of
work
i
know
the
sort
of
fellow
he
is
he
never
tell
you
that
you
are
doing
well
only
when
he
satisfied
with
you
pass
you
on
you
see
and
do
you
care
what
he
says
just
go
on
and
do
the
best
you
know
how
blair
told
me
that
if
you
tried
you
could
make
the
varsity
before
the
season
is
over
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
says
the
coaches
are
puzzling
their
brains
to
find
a
man
that
fit
to
take
the
place
of
dangfield
who
was
last
year
i
dare
say
answered
joel
despondently
but
durston
will
never
let
me
stop
tackling
that
dummy
arrangement
i
be
taking
falls
out
of
it
all
by
myself
when
the
yates
game
is
going
on
who
invented
that
thing
anyhow
but
nevertheless
joel
spirits
were
very
much
better
when
the
two
lads
reached
the
room
and
west
had
turned
on
the
soft
light
of
the
argand
and
taking
their
books
in
hand
and
settling
comfortably
back
in
the
two
great
cozy
armchairs
they
were
soon
busily
reading
hazing
has
gone
out
at
harwell
and
so
when
at
about
nine
the
two
boys
beard
many
footfalls
outside
their
door
and
when
in
response
to
west
loud
come
five
mysterious
and
muffled
figures
in
black
masks
entered
they
were
somewhat
puzzled
what
to
think
march
asked
a
deep
voice
yes
answered
joel
with
a
wondering
frown
west
yep
what
in
thunder
do
you
want
and
who
in
thunder
are
you
freshies
are
you
continued
the
inexorable
voice
the
maskers
had
closed
and
locked
the
door
behind
them
and
now
stood
in
rigid
inquisitorial
postures
between
it
and
the
table
none
of
your
business
answered
west
crossly
get
out
will
you
not
until
our
duties
are
done
answered
the
mask
you
are
freshies
nice
new
tender
little
freshies
we
are
here
to
initiate
you
into
the
mysteries
of
the
sacred
order
of
hullabalooloo
stand
up
neither
moved
they
were
already
standing
west
puzzled
and
angry
joel
wondering
and
amused
well
sit
down
then
commanded
the
voice
joel
looked
meaningly
at
outfield
and
as
the
latter
nodded
the
two
rushed
at
the
members
of
the
sacred
order
of
hullabalooloo
but
the
latter
were
prepared
over
went
the
nearest
armchair
down
from
the
wall
with
a
clatter
came
a
rack
of
books
and
this
way
and
that
swayed
the
forms
of
the
maskers
and
the
two
roommates
the
battle
was
short
but
decisive
and
when
it
was
done
joel
lay
gasping
on
the
floor
and
outfield
sprawled
breathless
on
the
couch
will
you
give
up
asked
the
first
mask
yes
growled
west
and
joel
echoed
him
then
you
may
get
up
responded
the
mask
but
mind
you
no
tricks
joel
thought
he
heard
the
sound
of
muffled
laughter
from
one
of
the
masks
as
he
arose
and
arranged
his
damaged
attire
freshman
march
will
favor
us
with
a
song
announced
the
mask
i
ca
sing
a
word
answered
joel
you
must
hullabalooloo
decrees
it
then
hullabalooloo
can
come
and
make
me
retorted
joel
stubbornly
what
asked
the
mask
in
a
deep
grewsome
voice
what
is
the
penalty
for
disobedience
tossed
in
the
blanket
answered
the
other
four
in
unison
you
hear
freshman
march
asked
the
mask
choose
i
sing
i
guess
answered
joel
with
a
grin
but
west
jumped
up
do
you
do
it
joel
they
ca
make
you
sing
and
they
ca
make
me
sing
and
the
first
one
that
comes
in
reach
will
get
knocked
down
oh
well
i
do
mind
singing
answered
joel
that
is
i
do
mind
trying
if
they
can
stand
it
i
can
what
shall
i
sing
what
do
you
know
i
only
know
one
song
i
sing
that
but
on
one
condition
name
it
answered
the
mask
that
you
join
in
and
sing
the
chorus
there
was
a
moment
of
hesitation
then
the
masks
nodded
and
joel
mounted
to
a
chair
and
with
a
comical
grimace
of
despair
at
west
who
sat
scowling
on
the
couch
he
began
there
is
a
flag
of
crimson
hue
the
fairest
flag
that
flieth
whose
folds
wave
over

to

or
far
or
near
that
loves
the
flag
of
hillton
joel
was
not
much
of
a
singer
but
his
voice
was
good
and
he
sang
as
though
he
meant
it
outfield
sat
unresponsive
until
the
verse
was
nearly
done
then
he
moved
restlessly
and
waited
for
the
chorus
and
when
it
came
joined
in
with
the
rest
and
the
strains
of
hilltonians
rang
triumphantly
through
the
building

the

the

the
knights
of
the
sacred
order
of
hullabalooloo
signified
their
approval
and
demanded
the
next
verse
and
joel
sang
it
and
when
the
chorus
came
the
maskers
lost
much
of
their
dignity
and
waved
their
arms
about
and
shouted
the
refrain
so
loud
that
doors
up
and
down
the
hall
opened
and
wondering
voices
shouted
shut
up
or
more
for
two
minutes
after
as
the
last
word
was
reached
joel
leaned
quickly
forward
toward
an
unsuspicious
singer
and
snatching
the
mask
from
his
face
revealed
the
countenance
of
louis
whipple
and
then
amid
much
laughter
the
other
masks
were
slipped
off
and
the
remaining
members
of
the
sacred
order
of
hullabalooloo
stood
revealed
as
blair
cartwright
somers
and
cooke
and
outfield
joining
in
the
laugh
at
his
own
expense
was
seized
by
cooke
and
waltzed
madly
around
the
table
while
the
rest
once
more
raised
the
strains
of
hilltonians

your

visitors
from
marchdale
despite
joel
dark
forebodings
he
was
at
last
released
from
tackling
practice
and
with
that
moment
he
began
to
take
hope
for
better
things
under
the
charge
of
kent
one
of
the
coaches
and
an
old
harwell
half
joel
was
instructed
in
catching
punts
till
his
arms
ached
and
his
eyes
watered
and
in
kicking
until
he
seemed
to
be
starting
with
the
ball
he
no
longer
dreaded
since
he
had
mastered
that
science
and
could
now
delight
the
coach
by
leaping
from
a
stand
as
though
shot
from
the
mouth
of
a
cannon
signals
he
had
no
trouble
with
his
memory
was
excellent
and
he
possessed
the
faculty
of
rapid
computation
though
as
yet
his
brain
had
been
but
little
taxed
since
the
practice
code
was
still
in
use
at
the
end
of
the
third
week
both
varsity
and
scrub
teams
were
at
length
selected
and
joel
to
his
delight
found
himself
playing
on
the
latter
two
match
games
a
week
was
now
the
rule
for
the
varsity
and
joel
each
wednesday
and
saturday
might
have
been
found
seated
under
the
fence
dividing
the
gridiron
from
the
grand
stand
wrapped
nearly
from
sight
if
the
afternoon
was
chilly
in
a
great
gray
blanket
and
watching
the
play
with
all
the
excited
ardor
of
the
veriest
schoolboy
on
the
stand
behind
one
saturday
prince
the
varsity
twisted
his
ankle
and
joel
was
taken
on
in
his
place
they
were
playing
amherst
and
joel
has
ever
since
held
that
college
in
high
esteem
for
that
it
was
against
its
eleven
he
made
his
into
harwell
football
life
and
how
he
played
the
captain
smiled
as
he
watched
him
prance
down
the
field
after
a
punt
never
content
to
be
there
in
time
but
always
striving
to
get
there
first
and
not
seldom
succeeding
once
he
succeeded
too
well
it
was
in
the
second
half
blair
it
was
his
first
year
on
the
team
was
playing
on
a
first
down
he
punted
the
ball
a
long
and
rather
low
kick
into
amherst
territory
joel
bowled
over
an
amherst
end
who
was
foolish
enough
to
get
in
the
way
and
started
down
the
field
like
an
indian
warrior
on
the
war
path
the
harwell
ends
were
a
little
in
advance
but
off
to
the
sides
and
joel
sprinted
hard
and
easily
passed
them
both
kingdon
the
right
half
gave
him
a
good
run
but
he
too
was
passed
and
joel
reached
the
amherst
just
as
that
gentleman
turned
for
the
ball
which
had
passed
unexpectedly
over
his
head
the
goal
line
was
but
thirty
yards
distant
joel
saw
only
the
the
ball
and
the
goal
line
he
forgot
everything
else
a
small
cyclone
struck
the
full
and
when
he
picked
himself
up
it
was
to
see
a
player
depositing
the
pigskin
back
of
goal
and
to
hear
a
roar
of
laughter
from
the
seats
then
he
yelled
off
side
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
and
tore
down
on
joel
and
much
to
that
young
gentleman
surprise
strove
to
wrest
the
ball
from
him
it
was
quite
uncalled
for
and
joel
naturally
resented
it
to
the
extent
of
pushing
violently
palms
open
against
the
amherst
man
jacket
with
the
result
that
the
amherst
gentleman
sat
down
backward
forcibly
upon
the
turf
at
some
distance
and
again
the
stands
laughed
but
joel
gravely
lifted
the
ball
and
walked
back
to
the
line
with
it
the
center
took
it
with
a
grin
and
as
the
five
yards
of
penalty
for
off
side
was
paced
joel
was
rewarded
for
his
play
with
the
muttered
query
from
the
captain
what
were
you
doing
you
idiot
but
too
great
zeal
is
far
more
excusable
than
too
small
and
joel
was
quickly
forgiven
and
all
the
more
readily
perhaps
since
amherst
was
held
for
downs
and
the
ball
went
over
on
the
second
next
play
but
joel
called
himself
a
great
many
unpleasant
names
during
the
rest
of
the
game
and
for
a
long
while
after
could
not
think
of
his
first
without
feeling
his
cheeks
redden
nevertheless
his
manner
of
getting
down
the
field
under
kicks
undoubtedly
impressed
the
coaches
favorably
for
when
the
scrub
was
further
pruned
to
allow
it
to
go
to
training
table
joel
was
retained
one
bright
october
day
joel
and
outfield
went
into
town
to
meet
the
former
parents
at
the
station
for
and
march
had
long
before
made
up
their
minds
to
the
visit
and
the
two
boys
had
been
looking
forward
to
it
for
some
time
it
was
worth
going
a
long
way
to
see
the
pleasure
with
which
the
old
farmer
and
his
wife
greeted
the
great
youth
who
towered
so
far
above
them
there
on
the
station
platform
joel
kissed
his
mother
fondly
patted
his
father
patronizingly
but
affectionately
on
the
back
and
asked
fifty
questions
in
as
many
minutes
and
all
his
mother
could
do
was
to
gaze
at
him
in
reverent
admiration
and
sigh
over
and
over
land
sakes
joel
march
how
you
do
grow
it
must
not
be
thought
that
west
was
neglected
farmer
march
in
especial
showed
the
greatest
pleasure
at
meeting
him
again
and
shook
hands
with
him
four
times
before
the
street
was
reached
and
the
car
that
was
to
carry
them
to
the
college
town
gained
the
boys
conducted
the
visitors
to
their
room
and
made
lunch
for
them
on
a
gas
stove
outfield
drawing
generously
on
his
private
larder
situated
under
the
foot
of
his
bed
then
the
four
hunted
up
a
pleasant
room
in
one
of
the
student
boarding
houses
and
afterward
showed
the
old
people
through
the
college
there
was
a
good
deal
to
see
and
many
questions
to
answer
since
father
was
not
a
man
to
leave
an
object
of
interest
until
he
had
learned
all
there
was
to
be
told
about
it
the
elms
in
the
yard
were
fast
losing
their
yellow
leaves
but
the
grass
yet
retained
much
of
its
verdancy
and
as
for
the
sky
it
was
as
sweetly
blue
as
on
the
fairest
day
in
spring
up
one
side
of
the
yard
and
down
the
other
went
the
sightseers
poking
into
dark
hallways
reading
tablets
and
inscriptions
the
latter
translated
by
west
into
the
most
startling
english
pausing
before
the
bulletins
to
have
the
numerous
announcements
of
society
and
club
meetings
explained
drinking
from
the
old
pump
in
the
corner
and
so
completing
the
circuit
and
storming
the
gymnasium
where
at
last
powers
of
reply
were
exhausted
and
outfield
promptly
sprang
into
the
breech
explaining
gravely
that
the
mattresses
on
the
floor
were
used
by
doctor
major
the
director
of
the
gymnasium
who
invariably
took
a
during
the
afternoon
that
the
suspended
rings
were
used
to
elevate
sophomores
while
corporeal
punishment
was
administered
by
freshmen
and
that
the
queer
little
weights
in
the
boxes
around
the
walls
were
reserve
paper
weights
then
the
line
of
march
was
taken
up
toward
sailors
field
where
they
arrived
just
in
time
to
see
the
beginning
of
the
practice
game
between
the
varsity
and
the
scrub
joel
had
been
excused
from
attendance
that
day
and
so
he
took
his
seat
beside
the
others
on
the
grand
stand
and
strove
to
elucidate
the
philosophy
of
football
you
see
the
scrubs
have
the
ball
they
must
get
it
past
the
varsity
down
to
the
end
of
the
field
where
they
can
either
put
it
down
over
the
line
or
kick
it
over
that
there
that
center
that
fellow
that
arranging
the
ball
he
kicks
off
there
it
goes
and
a
good
kick
too
sometimes
the
is
a
good
kicker
then
some
one
else
kicks
off
blair
has
the
ball
look
see
him
dodge
with
it
he
gained
ten
yards
that
time
oh
it
was
joel
mother
who
exclaimed
why
joel
that
other
man
threw
him
down
that
part
of
the
game
mother
he
did
that
to
keep
blair
from
getting
the
ball
any
nearer
the
scrub
goal
he
is
hurt
you
see
and
do
you
mean
that
they
do
that
all
the
time
pretty
often
and
do
get
thrown
around
that
way
joel
sometimes
mother
when
i
lucky
enough
to
get
the
ball
well
i
never
football
not
a
bad
game
march
west
was
saying
but
it
come
up
to
golf
you
know
it
too
rough
it
does
look
a
little
rough
answered
march
do
they
often
get
hurt
seems
as
though
when
a
boy
had
another
fellow
on
his
head
and
another
on
his
stomach
and
another
on
his
feet
and
the
whole
lot
of
them
banging
away
at
once
seems
like
that
boy
would
be
a
little
uncomfortable
west
laughed
sometimes
a
fellow
has
his
ankle
sprained
or
a
knee
twisted
or
a
bust
or
something
like
that
but
it
is
often
anything
worse
occurs
well
i
suppose
it
all
right
then
only
when
i
was
a
boy
we
never
went
round
trying
to
get
our
ankles
sprained
or
our
broke
you
young
fellows
are
tougher
than
we
were
i
guess
i
should
wonder
sir
i
believe
joel
has
been
feeling
pretty
bad
for
a
long
time
because
he
got
nothing
worse
than
a
broken
finger
what
broke
his
finger
did
he
eh
he
did
write
anything
about
it
what
he
mean
getting
broken
to
pieces
and
not
telling
his
parents
about
it
west
glanced
apprehensively
at
joel
but
the
latter
had
missed
the
conversation
being
busy
following
the
progress
of
barton
of
the
scrub
who
was
doing
a
long
run
along
the
side
line
well
it
was
much
of
a
break
sir
it
all
right
now
and
i
think
he
thought
you
be
worried
you
know
i
sure
if
it
had
been
anything
important
he
would
have
written
at
once
humph
grunted
joel
father
if
he
going
to
break
himself
in
pieces
he
better
stop
football
i
wo
have
him
taking
risks
tell
him
so
the
half
had
come
to
an
end
and
the
players
were
either
resting
on
the
ground
or
going
through
some
pass
or
start
under
the
tuition
of
a
coach
suddenly
joel
looked
down
to
see
briscom
the
scrub
captain
climbing
the
seats
he
ducked
his
bare
head
to
the
others
and
sank
into
the
seat
at
joel
side
look
here
march
can
you
help
us
out
the
next
half
they
taken
webster
on
the
varsity
and
he
lowered
his
voice
to
a
confidential
roar
we
want
to
make
a
good
showing
of
course
answered
joel
i
come
at
once
can
i
get
some
togs
from
some
fellow
yes
i
ask
whitman
to
find
some
i
sorry
to
take
you
away
from
your
folks
but
it
only
fifteen
minutes
you
know
so
when
the
whistle
blew
joel
was
at
left
on
the
scrub
attired
in
borrowed
plumage
that
came
far
from
fitting
him
and
march
was
in
a
tremor
of
dismay
lest
some
one
should
throw
joel
down
as
she
had
seen
blair
thrown
march
had
not
quite
recovered
from
his
resentment
over
his
son
failure
to
apprise
him
of
the
broken
finger
which
after
all
was
only
broken
in
west
imagination
and
viewed
his
advent
on
the
field
with
disfavor
outfield
began
to
wonder
if
his
pleasant
fiction
regarding
joel
finger
was
to
lead
to
unpleasant
results
when
march
relieved
his
mind
somewhat
by
suddenly
taking
interest
in
the
career
of
his
son
who
was
trying
to
make
an
end
run
inside
dutton
with
half
the
scrub
hauling
pushing
pulling
shoving
him
along
er
is
that
likely
to
be
bad
for
that
finger
of
his
oh
no
sir
answered
west
he
looks
out
for
his
finger
all
right
enough
there
he
made
the
distance
bully
work
good
old
joel
did
he
do
well
then
mr
west
asked
joel
mother
of
course
he
did
mother
answered
march
disdainfully
did
you
see
him
lugging
all
those
fellows
along
with
him
how
much
does
that
count
west
well
that
does
score
anything
but
it
helps
the
scrub
has
to
pass
that
line
down
there
before
it
can
score
what
they
trying
to
do
now
is
to
get
down
there
and
joel
helping
you
watch
him
now
i
think
they
going
to
give
him
the
ball
again
for
another
try
around
end
west
was
right
in
his
surmise
kicks
were
barred
save
as
a
last
resort
and
the
game
was
favoring
the
scrub
as
a
consequence
the
ball
was
passed
to
the
right
joel
darted
forward
like
an
arrow
took
the
ball
from
right
made
a
quick
swerve
as
he
neared
the
end
of
the
line
and
ran
outside
of
the
varsity
right
end
captain
dutton
who
had
been
playing
pretty
well
in
in
the
expectation
of
another
try
through
hole
as
joel
got
safely
by
it
is
more
than
likely
that
he
found
added
satisfaction
in
the
feat
as
he
recalled
that
remark
of
dutton
the
week
before
what
were
you
doing
you
idiot
joel
got
safely
by
dutton
and
fooled
the
sprightly
prince
but
very
nearly
ran
into
the
arms
of
kingdon
who
missed
his
tackle
by
a
bare
six
inches
then
the
race
began
joel
path
lay
straight
down
by
the
side
line
the
field
followed
him
at
a
distance
and
the
most
he
could
hope
for
was
a
near
the
corner
of
the
field
which
would
require
a
ai
that
joel
cried
march
forgetting
his
grammar
and
his
dignity
at
one
and
the
same
moment
and
jumping
excitedly
to
his
feet
ai
that
joel
there
running
hey
they
ca
catch
him
i
lay
joel
to
outrun
the
whole
blame
pack
of
every
day
sir
hey
what
i
think
he
all
right
sir
for
a
answered
west
gayly
hello
there
blair
leaving
the
bunch
i
do
care
if
it
a
shouted
march
he
ca
i
do
know
but
as
he
gaining
a
little
that
fellow
eh
looks
like
it
answered
west
while
march
with
her
hand
on
her
husband
arm
begged
him
to
sit
down
and
stop
acting
so
silly
geewhillikins
cried
march
joel
caught
no
not
yet
eh
too
bad
too
bad
run
joel
he
got
ye
suddenly
march
who
had
almost
subsided
on
his
seat
jumped
again
to
his
feet
here
stop
that
you
fellow
hi
he
turned
angrily
to
outfield
his
eyes
blazing
what
he
knock
him
down
for
eh
what
he
sitting
on
my
boy
for
is
that
fair
eh
west
and
march
calmed
him
down
and
explained
that
tackling
was
quite
within
the
law
and
that
he
only
sat
on
him
to
prevent
him
from
going
on
again
for
blair
had
cut
short
joel
triumph
fifteen
yards
from
the
goal
line
and
the
spectators
of
the
dash
down
the
field
were
slowly
settling
again
in
their
seats
march
was
presently
relieved
to
see
joel
arise
shake
himself
like
a
dog
coming
out
of
water
and
trot
back
to
his
position
another
five
minutes
during
which
the
scrub
tried
desperately
to
force
the
ball
over
the
varsity
goal
line
but
without
success
and
the
match
was
over
and
briscom
was
happy
for
the
varsity
had
scored
but
once
and
that
on
a
fumble
by
the
scrub
joel
trotted
off
with
the
teams
for
a
shower
and
a
and
west
conducted
his
parents
back
to
the
gate
where
they
awaited
him
on
the
way
march
confided
to
west
that
football
was
what
he
call
a
parlor
game
but
on
the
whole
it
appeared
to
be
rather
interesting
in
the
evening
the
quartet
went
into
town
to
the
theater
and
mother
cried
happily
over
the
homely
pathos
of
the
old
homestead
and
outfield
laughed
uproariously
upon
the
slightest
provocation
and
every
one
was
extremely
happy
and
afterward
they
electriced
back
to
college
as
west
put
it
and
the
two
boys
stayed
awake
very
very
late
laughing
and
giggling
over
the
humors
of
the
play
and
broken
finger
and
march
left
the
next
day
at
noon
and
joel
accompanied
them
to
the
depot
west
having
a
golf
engagement
which
he
could
not
break
and
when
had
been
said
and
the
long
train
had
disappeared
from
sight
joel
returned
to
college
on
foot
over
the
long
bridge
spanning
the
river
busy
with
craft
past
the
factories
noisy
with
the
buzz
of
wheels
and
the
clang
of
iron
and
on
along
the
avenue
until
the
tower
of
the
dining
hall
loomed
above
the
tops
of
the
autumn
branches
entering
the
yard
just
as
the
two
bell
was
ringing
chapter
xix
a
varsity
sub
give
a
boy
the
name
of
being
a
hero
and
it
will
stick
joel
was
still
pointed
out
by
admiring
hillton
graduates
to
their
friends
at
harwell
as
march
the
fellow
who
kicked
the
winning
in
the
eustace
game
two
years
ago
and
while
joel
had
performed
of
late
no
doughty
deed
to
sustain
his
reputation
for
valor
the
freshman
class
accepted
him
in
all
faith
as
a
sort
of
class
hero
off
duty
for
the
moment
perchance
but
ever
ready
to
shed
glory
upon
the
class
by
some
act
consequently
when
it
was
told
through
college
that
joel
march
had
been
taken
on
to
the
varsity
eleven
as
substitute
left
no
one
was
surprised
unless
it
was
joel
himself
the
freshman
class
wagged
its
head
knowingly
and
said
i
told
you
they
could
get
on
without
march
and
held
its
head
higher
for
that
one
of
its
members
was
a
varsity
player
it
is
not
a
frequent
thing
to
find
a
freshman
on
the
varsity
team
even
as
substitute
and
joel
fame
grew
apace
and
many
congratulations
were
extended
to
him
in
classroom
and
out
blair
was
one
of
the
first
to
climb
the
stairs
of
mayer
and
express
pleasure
at
the
event
he
found
joel
seated
in
the
window
propped
up
with
half
a
dozen
crimson
pillows
attempting
to
sketch
the
view
across
the
yard
to
send
home
to
his
sister
west
was
splicing
a
golf
shaft
and
whistling
blithely
over
the
task
hello
sophy
cried
that
youth
have
you
come
to
initiate
us
into
the
sacred
order
of
hullabalooloo
dump
those
books
off
the
chair
and
be
seated
march
is
such
a
beastly
untidy
chap
he
sighed
he
leave
his
books
around
that
way
despite
all
i
can
say
these
books
out
replied
blair
bear
the
name
of
one
west
on
their
title
pages
and
in
fact
on
a
good
many
other
pages
too
what
say
you
a
look
of
intense
surprise
overspread
the
face
of
outfield
how
passing
strange
he
muttered
and
is
there
a
chemistry
among
them
i
think
so
here
is
one
that
contains
mention
of
and
other
mystic
emblems
which
appear
very
tiresome
it
also
contains
several
pages
filled
with
diagrams
of
the
yard
and
plans
of
pompeii
before
the
devastation
yes
answered
west
that
my
chem
it
been
missing
ever
since
tuesday
but
those
are
not
diagrams
of
the
yard
my
sophomoric
friend
they
plans
of
the
golf
course
well
just
as
you
say
catch
say
march
i
just
heard
that
made
the
varsity

most
splendidly
glad
my
young
friend

three
hillton
fellows
on
the
team

selkirk
and
you
and
yours
tenderly
and
we
show
them

when
yates
faces

and
tell
you
a
little
fact
that
may
interest
you
prince
wo
last
until
the
yates
game
my
lad
he
going
silly
in
his
ankle
but
do
say
i
told
you
for
of
course
it
a
dead
secret
and
if
he
gives
out
get
the
posish
and
then
if
you
can
make
another
one
of
those
in
the
yates
game
shut
up
please
blair
groaned
joel
nonsense
you
all
right
i
heard
button
saying
last
week
that
nothing
short
of
a
house
could
have
stopped
you
that
day
he
must
think
me
an
awful
fool
responded
joel
the
idea
of
not
remembering
that
i
was
pshaw
why
the
first
time
i
played
against
eustace
at
hillton
i
tackled
the
referee
in
mistake
for
the
man
with
the
ball
and
threw
him
too
and
sat
on
his
head
west
grinned
and
they
say
blair
that
you
were
feeling
aggrieved
against
that
referee
because
he
had
called
you
down
for
holding
and
i
heard
that
you
were
such
a
fool
as
you
looked
nothing
in
it
my
boy
answered
wesley
blair
airily
mere
calumny
am
i
one
to
entertain
feelings
of
anger
and
resentment
against
my
fellow
men
verily
very
much
not
but
he
put
me
off
did
that
referee
chap
he
was
incapable
of
accepting
the
joke
what
is
more
depressing
than
a
fellow
who
ca
see
a
joke
march
two
fellows
who
ca
see
et
cetera
answered
joel
promptly
wrong
very
wrong
i
do
know
what
the
answer
is
but
i
quite
certain
it
is
that
well
i
must
be
going
have
studies
do
waste
the
golden
moments
in
idleness
i
grind
my
young
and
thoughtless
friends
i
grind
well
i
only
came
up
to
congratulate
you
march
of
maine
i
have
done
so
i
now
depart
farewell
never
allow
the
mere
fact
of
being
interfere
with
blair
slammed
the
door
just
in
front
of
a
whizzing
golf
ball
and
clattered
downstairs
presently
he
appeared
on
the
walk
beneath
the
window
and
wiggled
his
fingers
derisively
with
the
thumb
against
a
prominent
feature
of
his
face
but
at
the
first
squeak
of
the
window
being
pushed
up
he
disappeared
around
the
corner
joel
days
were
now
become
very
busy
ones
every
morning
he
was
awakened
at
seven
and
at
eight
was
required
to
be
on
hand
at
the
training
table
for
breakfast
the
quarters
were
at
old
a
boarding
house
opposite
the
college
yard
and
here
in
a
big
sunny
front
room
the
two
long
tables
were
laid
with
numerous
great
dishes
of
oatmeal
or
hominy
platters
of
smoking
steak
chops
or
crisp
bacon
plates
of
toast
while
potatoes
usually
baked
flanked
the
meat
the
beverage
was
always
milk
and
tall
pitchers
of
it
were
constantly
filled
and
emptied
during
this
as
well
as
the
other
meals
and
then
there
were
eggs
eggs
hard
boiled
eggs
soft
boiled
eggs
medium
eggs
poached
until
at
the
end
of
the
season
the
mere
mention
of
eggs
caused
joel
stomach
to
writhe
in
disgust
during
breakfast
disabilities
were
inquired
after
men
who
were
known
to
have
nerves
were
questioned
as
to
their
night
rest
and
orders
for
the
day
were
given
out
this
man
was
instructed
to
see
the
doctor
another
to
interview
the
trainer
a
third
to
report
to
the
head
coach
the
meal
over
save
for
a
half
hour
of
practice
for
the
backs
behind
the
gymnasium
the
men
were
free
to
give
all
their
energies
to
lessons
and
so
hurried
away
to
recitation
hall
or
room
at
one
the
team
assembled
again
for
lunch
with
books
in
hand
and
at
speed
devoured
the
somewhat
elaborate
repast
each
man
rushing
in
eating
and
rushing
out
with
no
attempt
at
sociability
or
heed
to
the
laws
of
digestion
afternoon
practice
was
at
four
individual
practice
was
followed
by
team
practice
against
an
imaginary
foe
and
this
in
turn
gave
place
to
a
against
the
second
eleven
two
stiff
halves
were
played
then
again
individuals
were
seized
on
by
captain
and
coaches
and
put
through
paces
to
remedy
some
fault
or
other
and
then
the
last
player
trots
off
the
field
and
the
coaches
conversing
earnestly
among
themselves
follow
and
the
day
work
is
done
there
are
still
the
bath
and
the
and
the
weighing
but
these
are
gone
through
with
leisurely
while
the
day
work
is
discussed
and
the
coaches
circulating
among
the
fellows
inflict
an
epilogue
of
criticism
and
instruction
there
remained
usually
the
better
part
of
an
hour
before
dinner
and
this
period
joel
spent
in
his
room
where
with
the
lamp
throwing
its
glow
over
his
shoulder
he
strove
to
take
his
mind
from
the
subject
of
tackling
and
starting
of
punting
and
passing
and
fix
it
upon
his
studies
for
the
morrow
for
life
was
far
from
being
all
play
that
fall
if
hard
practice
and
strict
training
can
be
called
play
and
joel
found
it
necessary
to
occupy
every
moment
not
taken
up
by
eating
sleeping
and
practicing
on
the
gridiron
with
hard
study
it
can
scarcely
be
truthfully
asserted
that
joel
lessons
suffered
by
reason
of
his
adherence
to
athletics
though
a
lecture
now
and
then
was
slighted
that
he
might
use
the
time
in
pursuing
some
study
that
lack
of
leisure
had
necessitated
his
neglecting
but
a
clear
head
a
good
digestion
and
racing
blood
render
studying
a
pleasure
rather
than
a
task
and
joel
found
that
while
giving
less
time
than
before
to
lessons
he
learned
them
fully
as
well
one
thing
is
certain
his
standing
in
class
did
not
suffer
even
when
the
coaches
were
more
than
usually
severe
joel
experience
that
fall
and
many
a
time
later
led
him
to
conclude
that
the
amount
of
outdoor
athletics
indulged
in
and
the
capability
for
study
are
in
direct
ratio
west
too
was
a
most
studious
young
gentleman
that
term
and
began
to
pride
himself
on
his
recently
discovered
ability
to
learn
to
be
sure
golf
was
a
hard
taskmaster
but
with
commendable
he
did
not
allow
it
to
interfere
with
his
progress
in
class
both
he
and
joel
had
earned
the
name
of
being
studious
ere
the
end
of
the
fall
term
and
neither
of
them
resented
it
unlike
the
preceding
meal
dinner
at
the
training
table
was
a
sociable
and
cheerful
affair
when
every
man
at
the
board
tried
his
best
to
be
entertaining
and
when
shop
either
study
or
football
was
usually
tabooed
the
menu
was
elaborate
there
were
soup
two
or
three
kinds
of
meat
a
half
dozen
vegetables
sauces
the
toast
pudding
or
cream
and
plenty
of
fruit
and
for
drinkables
why
there
was
the
milk
and
sometimes
light
ale
in
lesser
quantities
at
one
end
of
the
table
whether
head
or
foot
is
yet
undecided
sat
the
captain
at
the
other
end
the
head
coach
other
coaches
were
present
as
well
and
the
trainer
sat
at
the
captain
left
there
was
always
lots
of
noise
for
weighty
things
were
seldom
touched
upon
in
the
conversation
and
jokes
were
given
and
taken
in
good
part
when
all
other
means
of
amusement
failed
there
were
still
the
potatoes
to
throw
and
a
butter
chip
well
laden
can
be
tossed
upward
in
such
a
manner
that
it
will
remain
stuck
more
or
less
securely
to
the
ceiling
this
is
a
trick
that
comes
only
with
long
practice
but
any
one
may
try
it
and
the
ceiling
above
the
training
table
that
year
was
always
well
studded
with
suspended
disks
of
crockery
bread
fights
so
named
because
the
ammunition
is
more
likely
to
be
potatoes
were
extremely
popular
and
the
dinner
often
came
to
an
end
with
a
pitched
battle
in
which
coats
were
decorated
from
collar
to
hem
with
particles
of
that
clinging
vegetable
his
evenings
usually
belonged
to
joel
to
spend
as
he
wished
though
not
unfrequently
a
blackboard
talk
by
the
head
coach
or
a
lecture
by
some
visiting
authority
curtailed
them
considerably
he
had
always
to
be
in
bed
by
ten
but
sleep
sometimes
especially
after
a
day
of
hard
practice
did
not
readily
come
and
he
often
laid
awake
until
midnight
had
sounded
out
on
the
bell
in
the
old
church
tower
thinking
over
the
events
of
the
day
and
wondering
what
fate
in
the
person
of
the
head
coach
held
in
view
for
him
and
one
night
he
awoke
to
find
outfield
shaking
him
violently
by
the
shoulder
the
row
he
asked
sleepily
you
answered
outfield
you
been
yelling
for
half
an
hour
what
the
matter
with
you
anyhow
the
signals
muttered
joel
turning
sleepily
over
that
a
run
around
left
end
by
left
and
do
forget
to
start
when
the
ball
snapped
and
jump
high
if
you
blocked
and
do
forget
to
snore
snore
well
muttered
west
as
he
stumbled
against
an
armchair
and
climbed
into
bed
of
all
crazy
games
but
west
was
not
in
training
and
so
possessed
the
faculty
of
going
to
sleep
when
his
head
struck
the
pillow
as
a
consequence
the
rest
of
his
remark
was
never
heard
chapter
xx
an
old
friend
march
joel
march
joel
was
striding
along
under
the
shadow
of
the
chapel
on
his
way
from
a
recitation
to
mayer
and
his
room
the
familiar
tones
came
from
the
direction
of
the
library
and
turning
he
saw
stephen
remsen
trotting
toward
him
with
no
regard
for
the
grass
joel
hurdled
the
wire
barrier
and
strode
to
meet
him
the
two
shook
hands
warmly
almost
affectionately
in
the
manner
of
those
who
are
glad
to
meet
march
i
delighted
to
see
you
again
i
was
just
going
to
look
you
up
which
way
were
you
going
up
to
the
room
ca
you
come
up
for
a
while
when
you
arrive
are
you
going
to
stay
now
third
down
laughed
remsen
no
gain
what
a
fellow
you
are
for
questions
march
i
got
in
this
morning
and
i
going
to
stay
until
after
the
yates
game
they
telegraphed
me
to
come
and
coach
the
tackles
instead
of
going
to
your
room
let
go
to
mine
i
taken
a
suite
of
one
room
and
a
closet
at
dixon
on
the
avenue
i
have
unpacked
my
toothbrush
yet
come
over
with
me
and
take
lunch
and
we
talk
it
all
over
so
joel
stuck
his
books
under
his
arm
and
the
two
crossed
the
yard
traversing
the
quadrangle
in
front
of
university
and
debouching
on
to
the
avenue
near
where
the
tall
shaft
of
the
soldiers
monument
gleams
in
the
sunlight
but
they
did
not
wait
until
remsen
room
was
gained
to
talk
it
all
over
joel
had
lots
to
tell
about
the
hillton
fellows
whom
he
had
not
lost
sight
of
of
how
clausen
was
captain
of
the
freshman
eleven
and
was
displaying
a
wonderful
faculty
for
generalship
how
west
was
still
golfing
and
had
at
last
met
foemen
worthy
of
his
steel
how
dicky
sproule
was
in
college
taking
a
special
course
and
struggling
along
under
popular
dislike
how
whipple
and
cooke
were
rooming
together
in
peck
the
former
playing
on
the
sophomore
class
team
and
going
in
for
rowing
and
the
latter
still
the
same
idle
ignoramus
and
liked
by
every
fellow
who
knew
him
how
digbee
was
grinding
in
lanter
with
somers
how
cartwright
had
joined
the
glee
club
and
how
christie
had
left
college
and
gone
into
business
with
his
father
and
cloud
asked
remsen
have
you
seen
him
yes
once
or
twice
i
heard
that
he
was
very
well
liked
when
he
left
eustace
last
year
i
dare
say
he
has
turned
over
a
new
leaf
since
his
father
died
indeed
i
had
heard
of
that
west
heard
it
he
died
last
spring
and
left
cloud
pretty
near
penniless
they
say
i
have
an
idea
that
he
has
taken
a
brace
and
is
studying
more
than
he
used
to
the
chap
has
plenty
of
good
qualities
i
suppose
we
all
have
our
bad
ones
you
know
perhaps
it
only
needed
some
misfortune
to
wake
up
the
lad
better
nature
they
say
virtue
thrives
best
on
homely
fare
and
like
lots
of
other
proverbs
i
guess
it
sometimes
true
then
remsen
told
of
his
visit
to
hillton
a
few
weeks
previous
the
eleven
this
year
was
in
pretty
good
shape
he
thought
greene
an
upper
middle
man
was
captain
they
expected
to
have
an
easy
time
with
eustace
who
was
popularly
supposed
to
be
in
a
bad
way
for
veteran
players
that
same
greene
was
winning
the
golf
tournament
when
he
was
there
remsen
continued
and
the
golf
club
was
in
better
shape
than
ever
before
thanks
to
the
hard
work
of
west
whipple
blair
and
a
few
others
in
building
it
up
the
two
friends
reached
the
house
and
remsen
led
the
way
into
his
room
and
set
about
unpacking
his
things
joel
took
up
a
position
on
the
bed
and
gave
excellent
advice
as
to
the
disposal
of
everything
from
a
pair
of
stockings
to
a
typewriter
it
a
strange
fact
said
remsen
as
he
thrust
a
suit
of
pajamas
under
the
pillow
that
outfield
west
is
missed
at
hillton
more
than
any
fellow
who
has
graduated
from
there
for
several
years
past
perhaps
i
do
mean
exactly
strange
either
for
of
course
he
a
fellow
that
every
one
naturally
likes
what
i
do
mean
is
that
one
would
naturally
suppose
fellows
like
blair
or
whipple
would
leave
the
most
regrets
behind
them
for
blair
was
generally
conceded
to
be
the
most
popular
fellow
in
school
the
last
two
years
of
his
stay
and
whipple
was
surely
running
him
a
close
second
and
certainly
their
memories
are
still
green
but
everywhere
i
went
it
was
you
heard
from
outfield
west
west
getting
on
at
college
and
strange
to
say
such
inquiries
were
not
confined
to
the
fellows
alone
professor
wheeler
asked
after
west
particularly
and
so
did
briggs
and
several
others
of
the
faculty
and
cowles
as
well
but
you
are
still
the
hero
there
march
the
classic
history
of
hillton
still
recounts
the
prowess
of
one
joel
the
first
who
kicked
a
goal
from
field
and
defeated
thereby
the
hosts
of
eustace
and
professor
durkee
shakes
his
head
and
says
he
will
never
have
another
so
attentive
and
appreciative
member
of
his
class
and
now
tell
me
how
are
you
getting
on
with
dutton
so
joel
recited
his
football
adventures
in
full
not
omitting
the
ludicrous
which
received
laughing
applause
from
his
listener
and
recounting
his
promotion
to
the
position
of
varsity
substitute
yes
i
saw
in
the
paper
last
week
that
you
had
been
placed
on
the
sub
list
of
the
varsity
i
hope
you
have
a
chance
to
play
against
yates
although
i
do
wish
prince
any
harm
he
a
good
fellow
and
a
hard
worker
hello
it
let
get
some
lunch
a
half
hour
later
they
parted
joel
hurrying
off
to
recitation
and
remsen
remaining
behind
to
keep
an
appointment
with
a
friend
after
this
they
met
almost
every
day
and
remsen
was
a
frequent
caller
at
room
where
he
with
joel
and
outfield
held
long
cosy
chats
about
every
subject
from
enameling
golf
balls
to
the
philosophy
of
kant
and
the
original
protoplasm
meanwhile
the
season
hurried
along
harwell
met
and
defeated
the
usual
string
of
minor
opponents
by
varying
scores
and
ran
up
against
the
red
and
blue
of
keystone
college
with
disastrous
results
but
one
important
contest
intervened
between
the
present
time
and
the
game
with
yates
and
the
hardest
sort
of
hard
work
went
on
daily
inside
the
inclosed
field
a
small
army
of
graduates
had
returned
to
coach
the
different
players
and
the
daily
papers
were
filled
according
to
their
wont
with
columns
of
sensational
speculation
and
misinformation
regarding
the
merits
of
the
team
and
the
work
they
were
performing
out
of
the
mass
of
clashing
facts
contained
in
the
daily
journals
but
one
thing
was
absolutely
apparent
to
wit
the
work
of
the
harwell
eleven
was
known
only
to
the
men
and
the
coaches
and
neither
would
tell
about
it
at
last
when
chill
november
had
been
for
a
few
days
in
the
land
the
game
with
the
red
and
white
clad
warriors
from
ithaca
took
place
on
a
wet
and
muddy
field
and
joel
played
the
game
through
from
start
to
finish
prince
being
engaged
in
nursing
his
treacherous
ankle
which
had
developed
alarming
symptoms
with
the
advent
of
wet
weather
the
game
resulted
in
a
score
of
to
five
the
ithacans
scoring
a
neat
but
inexcusable
goal
from
field
in
the
first
half
joel
played
like
a
trojan
and
went
around
the
left
end
of
the
opposing
line
time
and
again
for
good
gains
until
the
mere
placing
of
the
ball
in
his
hands
was
accepted
by
the
spectators
as
equal
to
an
accomplished
gain
wesley
blair
made
a
dashing
charge
through
a
crowded
field
for
twelve
yards
and
scored
a
that
brought
the
onlookers
to
their
feet
cheering
dutton
the
captain
played
a
steady
brilliant
interfering
game
and
kingdon
at
right
plunged
through
the
holes
time
and
again
with
the
ball
hugged
to
his
stomach
and
kept
his
feet
in
a
manner
truly
marvelous
until
the
last
inch
had
been
gained
but
critics
nevertheless
said
unkind
things
of
the
team
work
as
they
wended
their
way
back
over
the
sodden
turf
and
shook
their
heads
dubiously
over
the
scored
by
the
opponents
there
would
be
a
general
shaking
up
on
the
morrow
they
predicted
and
we
should
see
what
we
should
see
and
the
coaches
too
although
they
dissembled
their
feelings
under
cheerful
countenances
found
much
to
condemn
and
the
operations
of
bathing
dressing
and
weighing
that
afternoon
were
less
enjoyable
to
the
breathless
tattered
men
the
next
day
the
team
went
into
executive
session
as
joel
called
it
and
the
predicted
took
place
murdoch
the
left
guard
was
deemed
too
slight
for
the
place
and
was
sent
to
the
side
line
from
where
he
presently
crawled
to
a
seat
on
the
great
empty
stand
and
hiding
his
blanketed
head
wept
like
a
child
and
there
were
other
changes
made
joel
kept
his
place
at
left
half
pending
the
bettering
of
prince
ankle
and
blair
was
secure
at
full
but
when
the
practice
game
began
many
of
the
old
forms
were
either
missing
or
to
be
seen
in
the
second
eleven
line
and
the
coaches
hovered
over
the
field
of
battle
with
dark
forbidding
looks
and
said
mean
things
whenever
the
opportunity
presented
itself
and
were
icily
polite
to
each
other
as
men
will
be
when
they
know
themselves
to
be
in
the
right
and
every
one
else
in
the
wrong
and
so
practice
that
thursday
was
an
unpleasant
affair
and
had
the
desired
effect
for
the
men
played
the
game
for
all
that
was
in
them
and
attended
strictly
to
the
matter
in
hand
forgetting
for
the
time
the
intricacies
of
latin
compositions
and
the
terrors
of
coming
examinations
when
it
was
over
joel
crawled
off
of
the
scale
with
the
emotions
of
a
weary
draught
horse
and
took
his
way
slowly
toward
home
in
the
square
he
ran
against
outfield
who
armed
with
a
monstrous
bag
of
golf
requisites
had
just
leaped
off
a
car
hello
joel
he
cried
what
happened
another
have
you
broken
that
finger
again
honest
injun
what
up
nothing
out
i
just
kind
of
half
dead
we
had
two
halves
with
coaches
yelling
at
us
every
second
and
a
field
like
a
turnip
patch
just
before
seeding
oh
no
there
nothing
the
matter
only
if
you
know
of
any
quiet
corner
where
i
can
die
in
peace
lead
me
there
out
i
wo
keep
you
long
it
will
soon
be
over
no
i
do
my
flippant
young
friend
but
i
know
something
a
heap
better
nothing
can
be
better
any
more

still
well
what
is
it
a
couple
of
hot
lemonades
and
a
pair
of
fat
sandwiches
at
noster

so

with
a

a

here
now
is
there
anything
not
clear
to
you
apparently
there
was
a
great

for
the
questions

fast
and
furious
the
coaches
all
taking
a
hand
in
the
discussion

the

being
explained
all
over
again
very
patiently
by

another

was
tackled

the
third
of

from
an
ordinary
formation

the

coach
it
is
intended
to
give
the
idea
of
a
kick
or
failing
that
of
a
run
around
left

it
will
very
probably
be
used
as
a
separate
play
in
the
last
few
minutes
of
a
half
especially
where
the
is
near
the
side
line

the
short
side
of

you
will
be

the

calling
this
as

when
the
signal
is

moves
in
a
step
or
two
toward
quarter
as
unnoticeably
as
possible
position
in
the
diagram
he
must
be
careful
to
come
to
a
full
stop
before
the
ball
is
snapped
back
and
should
time
himself
so
that
he
will
not
have
to
stay
there
more
than

the
diversion

much
of
the
success
of

it
must
be
practiced
until
there
is
no

questions
fellows
after
the
discussion
of
the
last
play
a
half
hour
talk
on
interference
was
given
to
the
rest
of
the
eleven
and
substitutes
who
had
arrived
meanwhile
remsen
and
joel
left
bancroft
together
and
crossed
the
yard
toward
the
latter
room
the
sky
was
bright
with
myriads
of
stars
and
the
buildings
seemed
magnified
by
the
wan
radiance
to
giant
castles
under
the
shadow
of
university
remsen
paused
to
light
his
pipe
and
without
considering
the
two
found
themselves
a
moment
later
seated
on
the
steps
from
the
avenue
the
of
car
gongs
sounded
sharp
and
clear
and
red
and
white
and
purple
lights
flitted
like
strange
through
the
half
light
and
disappeared
into
the
darkness
beyond
the
common
the
lights
in
the
stores
beamed
dimly
a
green
shade
in
threw
a
sickly
shaft
athwart
the
pavement
but
even
as
they
looked
a
tall
figure
weariness
emanating
from
every
movement
stepped
between
window
and
light
book
in
hand
and
drew
close
the
blinds
poor
devil
sighed
remsen
three
hours
more
of
work
i
dare
say
before
he
stumbles
half
blind
into
bed
and
all
for
what
joel
that
or
that
he
pointed
with
his
to
where
jupiter
shone
with
steady
radiance
high
in
the
depths
then
indicated
a
faint
yellow
glow
that
flared
for
an
instant
in
the
darkness
across
the
yard
where
a
passer
had
paused
to
light
his
pipe
we
ca
all
be
jupiters
remsen
answered
joel
calmly
some
of
us
have
to
be
little
sticks
of
wood
with
brimstone
tips
but
they
very
useful
little
things
matches
and
after
all
does
it
matter
as
long
as
we
do
what
we
have
to
do
as
well
as
we
can
old
jupiter
up
there
is
a
very
fine
chap
undoubtedly
and
if
he
shirked
a
minute
or
two
something
unpleasant
would
probably
occur
but
he
is
performing
his
task
any
better
than
the
little
match
performed
his
pouf
and
the
match
work
done
but
it
has
lighted
a
fire
can
you
do
better
mr
jupiter
remsen
made
no
reply
for
a
moment
but
joel
knew
that
he
was
smiling
there
beside
him
a
little
throng
of
students
passed
by
humming
softly
a
song
in
time
with
their
echoing
footsteps
and
glanced
curiously
at
the
forms
on
the
steps
then
remsen
struck
a
match
on
the
stone
pouf
he
said
musingly
relighting
his
pipe
in
the
act
of
tossing
the
charred
splinter
away
he
stopped
then
he
laid
it
beside
him
on
the
step
good
little
match
he
muttered
joel
laughed
softly
march
asked
remsen
presently
have
you
changed
your
mind
yet
about
studying
law
no
but
sometimes
i
get
discouraged
when
i
think
of
what
a
time
it
will
take
to
arrive
anywhere
and
sometimes
too
i
begin
to
think
that
a
fellow
who
ca
talk
more
readily
than
i
ought
to
go
into
the
hardware
business
or
raise
chickens
for
a
living
instead
of
trying
to
make
a
lawyer
out
of
himself
it
is
altogether
talk
march
answered
remsen
that
makes
a
good
lawyer
brains
count
some
if
you
get
where
you
can
conduct
a
case
to
a
successful
result
you
will
never
miss
the
o
the
gab
the
little
end
of
the
horn
in
my
profession
despite
tradition
i
asked
for
a
reason
march
he
went
on
what
do
you
say
to
our
forming
a
partnership
when
you
get
through
the
law
school
you
come
to
me
if
you
wish
and
tell
me
that
you
are
ready
to
enter
my
office
and
i
answer
very
glad
to
have
you
mr
march
of
course
we
could
arrange
for
a
regular
partnership
a
year
or
so
later
meanwhile
the
usual
arrangement
would
be
made
it
may
be
that
you
know
of
some
very
much
better
office
which
you
would
prefer
to
go
to
if
you
do
all
right
if
you
do
come
to
me
what
do
you
say
but
but
what
good
would
i
do
you
joel
asked
puzzled
at
the
offer
i
like
it
very
much
of
course
but
i
ca
see
i
tell
you
march
i
have
a
good
deal
of
faith
in
your
future
my
boy
you
have
a
great
deal
of
a
most
valuable
thing
called
application
which
i
have
not
worse
luck
you
are
also
and
to
a
remarkable
degree
and
some
day
twenty
or
thirty
years
from
now
you
likely
be
but
i
risk
that
by
the
time
out
of
college
i
shall
be
wanting
a
younger
man
to
take
hold
with
me
there
will
be
plenty
of
them
but
i
shall
want
a
good
one
and
that
is
why
i
make
this
offer
it
is
entirely
selfish
and
you
need
not
go
searching
for
any
philanthropy
in
it
i
only
looking
a
bit
ahead
and
buttering
my
toast
while
it
hot
march
what
do
you
say
or
no
you
need
say
anything
think
it
over
for
a
while
and
let
me
know
later
but
i
do
want
to
think
it
over
answered
joel
eagerly
i
ready
to
sign
such
a
partnership
agreement
now
if
you
really
believe
that
i
would
could
be
of
use
to
you
i
like
it
mightily
and
i
know
all
about
your
and
i
very
grateful
to
you
for
for
buttering
your
toast
later
when
they
arose
and
went
on
remsen
consented
to
accompany
joel
to
his
room
bribed
thereto
with
a
promise
of
hot
chocolate
they
found
outfield
diligently
poring
over
a
greek
history
but
he
immediately
discarded
it
in
favor
of
a
new
book
on
the
royal
game
which
lay
in
his
lap
hidden
under
a
note
book
you
see
he
explained
old
pratt
has
taken
a
shine
to
me
and
i
expected
him
to
call
this
evening
and
i
thought
at
first
that
you
were
he
or
him
which
is
it
and
of
course
i
did
want
to
disappoint
the
old
gentleman
he
has
such
a
fine
opinion
of
me
you
know
while
outfield
boiled
the
water
and
laid
bare
the
contents
of
the
larder
joel
told
him
of
remsen
offer
a
box
of
biscuits
went
down
with
a
crash
and
outfield
turned
indignantly
that
all
very
fine
he
exclaimed
but
where
do
i
come
in
how
about
west
where
does
he
get
his
show
in
this
arrangement
you
promised
that
if
i
studied
law
too
joel
you
go
into
partnership
with
now
did
you
but
it
was
all
in
fun
protested
joel
distressedly
i
suppose
you
meant
it
you
know
meant
it
answered
outfield
indignantly
of
course
i
meant
it
you
expect
i
appreciate
and
and
applicationousness
just
as
much
as
remsen
why
i
had
it
all
fixed
we
were
to
have
an
office
fitted
with
cherry
railings
and
revolving
bookcases
near
near
a
good
links
suggested
remsen
smilingly
well
yes
admitted
outfield
that
would
be
a
half
bad
idea
but
now
you
two
have
gone
and
spoiled
it
all
well
i
tell
you
west
suggested
remsen
you
come
in
with
us
and
supply
the
picturesque
element
of
the
business
you
might
look
after
the
golf
cases
you
know
injuries
to
gentlemen
by
gutties
trespassing
by
players
forfeiting
of
leases
and
so
forth
what
do
you
say
all
right
answered
outfield
cheerfully
but
it
must
be
understood
that
the
afternoons
belong
to
the
links
and
not
to
the
law
so
stephen
remsen
and
joel
march
sealed
their
agreement
by
shaking
hands
and
outfield
grinned
approval
one
afternoon
a
few
days
later
outfield
pranced
into
the
room
just
as
dusk
was
falling
brandishing
aloft
a
mug
and
uttering
a
series
of
loud
cheers
for
me
joel
who
had
returned
but
a
moment
before
from
a
hard
afternoon
practice
and
was
now
studying
in
the
window
seat
by
the
waning
light
looked
languidly
curious
a
trophy
joel
a
trophy
from
the
links
cried
west
won
by
the
great
me
by
two
holes
from
jenkins
jenkins
the
previously
great
jenkins
the
defeated
and
devastated

tossed
the
mug
into
joel
lap

team

lapham

open

oh

my
lad
it
was
quite
the
most
wonderful
young
match
jenkins
led
all
the
way
to
the
fifteenth
hole
then
he
foozled
like
a
schoolboy
and
i
holed
out
in
one
and
went
on
to
the
cheese
box
in
two
i
awfully
glad
repeated
joel
smiling
up
into
the
flushed
and
triumphant
face
of
his
chum
if

go
to
new
york
it
will
be
after
the
big
game
and
if

and

outfield
west
executed
a
and
whooped
ecstatically
will
you
joel
honest
injun
cross
your
heart
and
hope
to
die
then
shake
hands
my
lad
it
a
bargain
now
where
my
chemistry
the
days
flew
by
and
the
date
of
the
yates
game
rapidly
approached
the
practice
was
secret
every
afternoon
and
the
coaches
lost
weight
eluding
the
newspaper
reporters
prince
disappointed
joel
by
returning
to
the
varsity
with
his
ankle
apparently
as
well
as
ever
although
he
was
generally
played
easy
and
joel
often
took
his
place
in
the
second
half
of
the
practice
games
and
at
last
the
thursday
preceding
the
big
game
arrived
and
the
team
and
substitutes
together
with
the
trainer
and
the
manager
and
the
head
coach
and
two
canine
mascots
assembled
in
the
early
morning
in
the
square
and
were
hustled
into
coaches
and
driven
into
town
to
their
train
and
half
the
college
heroically
arose
phenomenally
early
and
stood
in
the
first
snow
storm
of
the
year
and
cheered
and
cheered
for
the
team
individually
and
collectively
for
the
head
coach
and
the
trainer
for
the
rubbers
and
the
mascots
and
between
times
for
the
college
the
players
went
to
a
little
country
town
a
few
miles
distant
from
the
seat
of
yates
university
and
spent
the
afternoon
in
practicing
signals
on
the
hotel
grounds
the
next
day
friday
was
a
day
of
rest
save
for
running
through
a
few
formations
and
trick
plays
after
lunch
and
taking
a
long
walk
at
dusk
the
yates
glee
club
journeyed
over
in
the
evening
and
gave
an
impromptu
entertainment
in
the
parlor
a
courtesy
well
appreciated
by
the
harwell
team
whose
nerves
were
now
beginning
to
make
themselves
felt
and
the
next
morning
the
journey
was
continued
and
the
college
town
was
reached
at
half
past
eleven
the
men
were
welcomed
at
the
station
by
a
crowd
of
harwell
fellows
who
had
already
arrived
and
the
harwell
band
did
its
best
until
the
team
was
driven
off
to
the
hotel
there
for
the
first
time
the
men
were
allowed
to
see
the
for
the
game
it
was
a
long
list
containing
the
names
ages
heights
and
weights
of
players
and
substitutes
and
was
immediately
the
center
of
interest
to
all
thunder
growled
joel
ruefully
as
he
finished
reading
the
list
over
blair
shoulder
it
a
thumpin
long
ways
down
to
chapter
xxii
before
the
battle
harwell
harwell
harwell
harwell
the
lobby
grew
empty
on
the
instant
and
outside
on
the
steps
and
on
the
sidewalk
the
crowd
spread
itself
the
procession
had
just
turned
the
corner
the
college
band
leading
the
freshmen
won
cried
a
voice
on
the
edge
of
the
throng
and
the
news
was
passed
along
from
man
to
man
until
it
swept
up
the
steps
through
the
lobby
and
to
the
dining
room
upstairs
where
the
football
men
of
the
varsity
team
were
impatiently
awaiting
lunch
a
good
omen
said
the
head
coach
below
in
the
street
admonitory
thumps
upon
the
great
drum
with
its
college
on
the
head
were
heard
and
a
moment
later
the
shouts
of
the
exuberant
freshmen
and
their
allies
were
drowned
in
the
first
strains
of
the
college
song
off
came
the
silk
hats
of
the
graduates
and
the
plaided
golf
caps
of
the
students
and
side
by
side
there
in
the
street
they
lifted
their
voices
in
the
sweet
measured
strains
of
the
dear
familiar
hymn
and
stout
men
of
fifty
with
comfortable
bank
accounts
and
incipient
twinges
of
gout
felt
the
unaccustomed
dimming
of
the
sight
that
presages
tears
and
boyish
carefree
students
to
whom
the
song
was
as
much
an
everyday
affair
as
d
marks
and
unpaid
bills
felt
strange
stirrings
in
their
breasts
and
with
voices
that
stumbled
strangely
over
the
top
notes
sang
louder
and
louder
and
upstairs
in
the
dining
room
many
a
throat
grew
hard
and
lumpy
as
the
refrain
came
in
at
the
open
windows
but
as
the
trainer
muttered
presently
it
was
only
the
freshmen
who
had
won
and
the
real
battle
of
the
day
was
yet
to
come
and
soon
the
band
and
the
shouting
parade
wheeled
away
from
beneath
the
windows
and
swung
off
up
the
street
to
make
known
far
and
wide
the
greatness
of
harwell
her
freshmen
and
the
grandeur
of
their
victory
over
the
youngsters
of
yates
and
as
the
last
cheer
floated
up
from
the
procession
as
it
disappeared
around
a
far
corner
lunch
was
served
and
player
and
coach
trainer
and
rubber
substitute
and
mascot
drew
up
to
the
last
meal
before
what
victory
or
defeat
it
was
not
a
merry
repast
that
lunch
before
the
fray
some
men
could
not
bring
themselves
to
eat
at
all
until
the
coaches
commanded
with
dire
threats
others
as
though
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
was
about
to
take
place
ate
heartily
hungrily
of
everything
set
before
them
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
joel
march
played
with
his
steak
and
tried
to
delude
himself
into
thinking
he
was
eating
he
felt
rather
upset
and
weak
in
the
joints
and
as
for
the
lad
stomach
it
had
revolted
at
sight
of
the
very
first
egg
but
luckily
the
last
meal
before
a
game
has
little
effect
one
way
or
the
other
upon
the
partaker
since
he
is
already
keyed
up
mentally
and
physically
to
a
certain
pitch
and
nothing
short
of
cold
poison
can
alter
it
in
the
streets
below
for
blocks
in
all
directions
the
crowds
surged
up
and
down
and
shouts
for
harwell
and
yells
for
yates
arose
like
challenges
in
the
afternoon
air
friends
met
who
had
not
done
so
for
years
enemies
accorded
enemies
bows
of
recognition
ere
they
remembered
their
enmity
the
deep
blue
and
the
deeper
crimson
passed
and
counterpassed
brushed
and
fluttered
side
by
side
and
lighted
up
the
little
college
city
till
it
looked
like
a
garden
of
roses
and
violets
and
everywhere
over
all
was
the
tensity
that
ever
reigns
before
a
battle
the
voices
of
the
ticket
speculator
and
of
the
merchant
of
score
cards
were
heard
upon
every
side
the
street
cars
poked
their
blunt
noses
through
the
crowd
which
closed
in
again
behind
them
like
water
about
the
stern
of
a
ship
violets
blossomed
or
crimson
chrysanthemums
bloomed
upon
every
coat
and
wrap
or
hung
pendant
from
the
handle
of
cane
and
umbrella
the
flags
of
harwell
and
yates
the
white
h
and
white
y
were
everywhere
shop
windows
were
partisan
to
the
blue
but
held
dashes
of
crimson
as
a
sop
to
the
demands
of
hospitality
and
welcome
at
one
the
exodus
from
town
began
along
the
road
that
leads
to
the
football
field
hurried
the
sellers
of
rush
cushions
and
badges
of
score
cards
and
pencils
of
blue
and
crimson
flags
and
cheap
canes
of
peanuts
and
sandwiches
of
soda
water
and
sarsaparilla
bent
upon
securing
advantageous
stands
about
the
entrance
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
spectators
were
on
the
way
the
cars
filled
in
and
out
with
shouting
humanity
crept
slowly
along
a
bare
half
block
separating
them
roystering
students
swung
arm
in
arm
in
eccentric
dance
from
side
to
side
across
the
street
ladies
with
their
escorts
hurried
along
the
sidewalks
carriages
bright
with
fluttering
flags
rolled
by
bicycles
darted
in
and
out
their
riders
throwing
words
of
salutation
over
their
shoulders
to
friends
by
the
way
in
the
windows
along
the
route
was
displayed
the
bravery
of
blue
banners
a
window
in
a
college
hall
was
piled
high
with
great
pillows
each
bearing
a
great
challenging
y
in
white
ribbon
or
embroidery
and
overhead
the
sky
arched
a
broad
blue
expanse
from
horizon
to
horizon
in
this
manner
on
some
fair
morning
centuries
ago
did
all
greece
wend
its
way
to
the
stadium
and
the
games
of
olympia
in
the
hotel
the
lunch
was
over
and
that
terrible
age
between
it
and
the
arrival
of
the
coaches
was
dragging
its
weary
length
along
joel
and
blair
were
standing
by
the
window
talking
in
voices
that
tried
to
be
calm
cool
and
indifferent
but
which
were
neither
they
offering
bets
of
ten
to
nine
downstairs
that
yates
wins
remarked
blair
with
elaborate
composure
are
they
responded
joel
thinking
the
while
of
the
signal
for
the
second
sequence
i
thought
the
odds
were
even
they
were
until
the
news
about
chesney
shoulder
got
about
but
there
is
really
anything
the
matter
with
his
shoulder
is
there
no
no
one
knows
how
the
story
got
out
whipple
was
taking
all
he
could
get
a
while
ago
some
one
wants
to
see
you
at
the
door
march
called
the
trainer
and
joel
found
outfield
west
smiling
and
happy
waiting
there
how
are
you
he
whispered
all
right
how
are
the
rest
great
gobble
joel
but
these
yates
johnnies
are
so
sure
of
winning
that
they
keep
still
there
a
rumor
here
in
the
lobby
that
yates
center
is
sick
know
anything
about
it
joel
shook
his
head
well
i
see

at
the
field
we
going
out
now
cooke
and
caldwell
and
some
of
the
others
so
long
my
valiant
lad
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
and
never
say
die
and
all
that
you
know
adios
there
was
a
cheer
below
and
blair
at
the
window
announced
the
arrival
of
the
conveyances
instantly
the
lethargy
of
a
minute
before
was
turned
to
excited
bustle
and
confusion
pads
and
jerseys
and
coats
balls
and
satchels
were
seized
and
laid
aside
and
grabbed
up
again
cries
for
missing
apparel
and
paraphernalia
were
heard
on
every
side
and
only
a
loud
peremptory
command
to
shut
up
from
the
head
coach
restored
order
and
quietude
then
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
down
the
narrow
stairs
they
trooped
through
the
crowded
lobby
where
friends
hemmed
them
about
patting
the
broad
backs
shouting
words
of
cheer
into
their
ears
and
delaying
them
in
their
passage
into
the
coaches
they
hurried
and
as
the
crowd
about
the
hotel
burst
into
loud
ringing
cheers
the
whips
were
cracked
and
the
journey
to
the
field
began
the
route
lay
along
quiet
unfrequented
streets
where
only
an
occasional
cheer
from
a
college
window
met
their
advent
restraint
had
worn
off
now
and
the
fellows
were
chatting
fast
and
furiously
joel
looked
out
at
the
handsome
homes
and
sunny
street
and
was
aware
only
of
a
longing
to
be
in
the
fray
an
impatient
desire
to
be
doing
briscom
the
substitute
centre
a
youth
of
summers
and
one
hundred
and
pounds
sat
beside
him
i
was
here
two
years
ago
with
the
freshman
team
he
was
saying
we
did
do
a
thing
to
them
we
youngsters
although
the
varsity
was
licked
badly
and
all
during
the
afternoon
game
we
sat
together
and
cheered
until
at
five
i
could
speak
above
a
whisper
that
was
a
great
game
that
freshman
contest
it
took
three
hours
and
a
half
to
settle
it
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
half
there
were
only
three
men
on
our
team
who
had
played
in
the
first
i
was
one
of
them
i
was
playing
left
guard
story
there
was
another
he
gave
up
before
the
game
was
through
though
i
held
out
and
when
the
whistle
sounded
down
i
went
on
the
grass
and
did
stir
for
ten
minutes
we
had
two
referees
that
day
the
first
chap
got
hurt
in
a
rush
and
it
took
us
half
an
hour
to
find
a
fellow
brave
enough
to
take
his
place
that
a
game
football
tame
nowadays
across
the
coach

right

disappeared
into
the
quarters

time

still
thronged

the
people
already
on
the
stands
it
was
a
puzzle
where
the
newcomers
were
going
to
find
seats
on
the
east
side
of
the
field
yates
held
open
house
from
end
to
end
and
overflowing
half
way
around
both
north
and
south
stands
the
blue
of
yates
fluttered
in
the
little
afternoon
breeze
till
that
portion
of
the
field
looked
like
a
bank
of
violets
on
the
west
stand
tier
after
tier
of
crimson
arose
until
it
waved
against
the
limitless
blue
of
the
sky
countless
flags
dipped
and
circled
crimson
bonnets
gleamed
everywhere
and
great
bunches
of
swaying
chrysanthemums
nodded
and
becked
to
each
other
all
collegedom
with
its
friends
and
relations
was
here
all
collegedom
that
is
within
traveling
distance
beyond
that
eager
eyes
were
watching
the
bulletin
boards
from
maine
to
mojave
the
cheering
had
begun
starting
at
one
end
of
the
west
stand
the
slogan
sped
section
by
section
growing
in
volume
as
it
went
and
causing
the
crimson
flags
and
banners
to
dance
and
leap
in
the
sunlight
across
the
field
answering
cheers
thundered
out
and
the
bank
of
violets
trembled
as
though
a
wind
ruffled
it
in
front
of
the
north
stand
the
yates
college
band
added
the
martial
strains
of
the
stars
and
stripes
forever
to
the
general
pandemonium
of
enthusiasm
then
along
the
west
stand
a
ripple
of
laughter
which
grew
into
a
loud
cheer
traveled
as
a
bent
and
decrepit
figure
attired
in
a
long
black
frock
coat
and
high
silk
hat
the
latter
banded
with
crimson
ribbon
came
into
sight
down
the
field
it
was
the
old
fruit
seller
of
harwell
whose
years
are
beyond
reckoning
and
who
is
remembered
by
the
oldest
graduates
on
he
came
his
old
wrinkled
face
grimacing
in
toothless
smiles
his
ribboned
cane
waving
in
his
trembling
hand
and
his
bald
head
bowing
a
welcome
to
the
watchers
for
it
was
not
he
who
was
the
guest
for
from
time
almost
immemorial
the
old
fruit
seller
has
presided
at
the
contests
of
harwell
rejoicing
in
her
victories
lamenting
over
her
defeats
down
the
line
he
limped
while
graduates
and
undergrads
cheered
him
loyally
calling
his
name
over
and
over
and
so
back
to
a
seat
in
the
middle
of
the
stand
from
where
all
through
the
battle
his
cane
waved
unceasingly
he
was
not
the
only
one
welcomed
by
the
throng
a
great
jurist
chrysanthemumed
from
collar
to
waist
bowed
jovial
acknowledgment
of
the
applause
his
appearance
summoned
the
governor
of
a
state
came
too
to
see
once
more
the
crimson
of
his
alma
mater
clashing
with
the
blue
of
her
old
enemy
professors
who
had
put
aside
their
books
beamed
benevolently
through
their
glasses
as
they
walked
somewhat
embarrassedly
past
the
grinning
faces
of
their
pupils
old
football
players
former
captains
bygone
masters
of
rowing
commanders
of
olden
baseball
teams
all
these
and
many
more
were
there
and
were
welcomed
heartily
tumultuously
by
the
wearers
of
the
red
and
through
it
all
the
cheers
went
on
the
college
songs
were
sung
and
the
hearts
of
youth
and
age
were
happy
and
glad
together
then
the
cry
of
here
they
come
traveled
along
the
field
and
the
warriors
leaped
into
the
arena
at
the
far
end
and
the
east
stand
went
delirious
and
flags
waved
and
a
tempest
shook
the
bank
of
violets
yates
and
almost
simultaneously
the
west
stand
arose
and
its
voice
arose
to
the
sky
in
wild
frenzied
shouts
of
for
over
the
fence
came
the
head
coach
and
big
chesney
and
captain
dutton
story
the
little
and
all
the
others
a
long
line
of
warriors
with
joel
march
briscom
bedford
and
the
other
substitutes
flocking
along
in
the
tag
end
of
the
procession
over
the
field
the
two
elevens
spread
while
cheer
after
cheer
met
in
clashed
and
rolled
upward
to
the
blue
then
came
a
bare
five
minutes
of
punting
dropping
passing
snapping
ere
the
officials
appeared
from
somewhere
and
gathered
the
opposing
captains
to
them
a
coin
flashed
in
the
sunlight
spun
aloft
descended
and
was
caught
in
the
referee
palm
heads
cried
ferguson
the
yates
captain
heads
it
is
announced
the
referee
the
substitutes
retreated
unwillingly
to
the
side
lines
the
harwell
men
spread
themselves
over
the
north
end
of
the
gridiron
elton
the
yates
ground
his
heel
into
the
turf
and
pointed
the
ball
the
cheering
ceased
the
whistle
piped
merrily
the
bright
new
ball
soared
aloft
on
its
arching
flight
and
the
game
of
the
year
was
on
chapter
xxiii
harwell
yates
the
first
half
that
game
will
live
in
history
it
was
a
battle
royal
between
giant
foes
on
one
hand
was
the
confidence
begat
of
fifteen
years
of
almost
continuous
victory
over
the
crimson
on
the
other
the
desperation
that
such
defeat
brings
yates
had
a
proud
record
to
sustain
harwell
a
decade
of
worsting
to
atone
for
and
thousand
persons
watched
and
hoped
and
feared
as
the
battle
raged
down
settled
the
soaring
ball
into
the
arms
of
kingdon
who
tucked
it
under
his
arm
and
started
with
it
toward
the
distant
goal
but
eight
yards
was
all
he
found
ere
a
yates
forward
crashed
down
upon
him
then
came
a
quick
on
harwell
forty
yards
and
first
prince
then
kingdon
then
blair
was
put
through
the
line
each
for
a
small
gain
and
the
harwell
benches
shouted
their
triumph
again
the
pigskin
was
given
to
prince
for
a
try
through
the
hole
between
tackle
and
guard
but
this
time
he
was
hurled
back
for
a
loss
the
next
try
was
kingdon
and
he
made
a
yard
around
the
yates
left
end
it
was
the
third
down
and
five
yards
were
lacking
back
went
the
ball
for
a
kick
and
a
moment
later
it
was
yates
on
her
yards
and
again
the
teams
were
lining
up
it
was
now
the
turn
of
the
east
stand
to
cheer
and
mightily
the
shout
rolled
across
the
field
through
came
the
yates
full
the
ball
safely
stowed
in
the
crook
of
his
elbow
the
whole
force
of
the
backs
shoving
him
on
three
yards
was
his
another
again
the
yates
was
given
the
ball
and
again
he
gained
and
it
was
the
first
down
on
yates
line
then
began
a
rout
in
which
harwell
retreated
and
yates
pursued
until
the
leather
had
crossed
the
middle
of
the
field
the
gains
were
made
anywhere
everywhere
it
seemed
allardyce
yielded
time
and
again
and
selkirk
beside
him
lacking
the
other
support
was
thrust
aside
almost
at
will
the
yates
shouters
were
wild
with
joy
and
the
cheers
of
harwell
were
drowned
beneath
the
greater
outbursts
from
the
supporters
of
the
blue
harwell
appeared
to
be
outclassed
so
far
as
her
rush
line
was
concerned
past
the
line
went
the
ball
and
between
it
and
the
next
white
streak
harwell
at
last
made
a
desperate
stand
and
secured
the
ball
at
the
first
play
it
was
sent
speeding
away
from
blair
toe
to
the
yates
a
long
clean
high
kick
that
led
the
forwards
down
under
it
in
time
to
throw
the
waiting
back
ere
he
had
taken
a
step
and
that
brought
shouts
of
almost
tearful
delight
from
the
harwell
sympathizers
back
to
her
returned
yates
and
slowly
but
very
surely
the
contest
moved
over
the
lost
ground
back
toward
the
harwell
goal
the
line
was
passed
again
the
fifty
the
and
here
or
there
holes
were
being
torn
in
the
harwell
line
and
the
crimson
was
going
down
before
the
blue
at
her
line
harwell
stayed
again
for
a
while
the
onslaught
of
the
enemy
and
tried
thrice
to
make
ground
through
the
yates
line
then
back
to
the
hands
of
wilkes
went
the

not

enough
to

out

it

the

chaos

paled
into

beside
the
outbursts
of
cheers
that
followed
each
other
like
claps
of
thunder
up
and
down
the
long
bank
of
fluttering
color
upon
the
other
side
of
the
field
no
rival
shouts
were
heard
it
was
useless
to
try
and
drown
that
niagara
of
sound
but
here
and
there
crimson
flags
waved
defiantly
at
the
triumphant
blue
the
goal
was
an
easy
one
though
it
is
probable
that
it
would
have
been
made
had
it
been
five
times
more
difficult
for
elton
was
the
acknowledged
goal
kicker
par
excellence
of
the

then
back
trotted
the
teams
and
as
the
harwell
eleven
lined
up
for
the
allardyce
at
left
guard
gave
place
to
murdoch
the
big
fellow
had
given
out
and
had
limped
and
choking
from
the
field
the
whistle
sounded
and
the
ball
rose
into
air
corkscrewing
toward
the
yates
goal
down
the
field
under
it
went
the
harwell
runners
like
bolts
from
a
bow
and
the
yates
half
who
secured
the
pigskin
was
downed
where
he
caught
the
two
teams
lined
up
quickly
then
back
foot
by
foot
yard
by
yard
went
the
struggling
harwell
men
yet
the
retreat
was
less
like
a
rout
than
before
and
yates
was
having
harder
work
her
players
were
twice
piled
up
against
the
harwell
center
and
she
was
at
last
forced
to
send
a
youth
around
the
left
end
an
experiment
which
netted
her
twelve
yards
and
which
brought
the
east
stand
to
its
feet
yelling
like
mad
but
here
the
crimson
line
at
length
braced
and
the
ball
went
to
its
center
on
three
downs
and
the
tide
turned
for
a
while
the
backs
and
the
right
end
were
hurled
one
after
another
at
the
opposing
line
and
shouts
of
joy
arose
from
the
crimson
seats
as
gain
after
gain
resulted
thrice
in
quick
succession
captain
dutton
shot
through
the
left
end
of
the
blue
line
the
second
time
for
a
gain
of
five
yards
the
cheering
along
the
west
side
of
the
great
field
was
now
continuous
and
the
leaders
their
crimson
badges
fluttering
agitatedly
were
waving
their
arms
like
tireless
semaphores
and
exciting
the
supporters
of
harwell
to
greater
and
greater
efforts
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
coveted
crept
the
crimson
line
with
precision
the
ball
was
snapped
the
quarter
passed
the
half
leaped
forward
the
rush
line
plunged
and
strove
and
then
from
somewhere
a
faint
down
was
cried
and
the
panting
players
staggered
to
their
feet
leaving
the
ball
yet
nearer
to
the
threatened
goal
line
on
the
blue
yards
the
whistle
shrilled
and
a
murmur
of
dismay
crept
over
the
yates
seats
as
it
was
seen
that
captain
ferguson
lay
motionless
on
the
ground
but
a
moment
rubbing
brought
him
to
his
feet
again
he
not
much
hurt
explained
the
knowing
ones
he
wants
to
rest
a
bit
a
minute
later
while
the
ball
still
hovered
about
the
line
yates
secured
it
on
a
fumbled
pass
and
the
tide
ebbed
away
from
the
beleagured
posts
back
as
before
were
borne
the
crimson
warriors
while
the
yates
forwards
opened
holes
in
the
opposing
line
and
the
yates
halves
dashed
and
wormed
through
for
small
gains
then
fate
again
aided
the
crimson
and
on
the
blue
line
a
fake
kick
went
sadly
aglee
and
the
runner
was
borne
struggling
back
toward
his
own
goal
before
he
could
cry
down
and
big
chesney
grinned
gleefully
as
he
received
the
leather
and
bent
his
broad
back
above
it
canes
crysanthemums
umbrellas
flags
carnations
hats
all
these
and
many
other
things
waved
frantically
above
the
great
bank
of
crimson
as
the
little
knot
of
gallant
knights
in
moleskin
crept
back
over
their
recent
path
of
retreat
and
took
the
war
again
into
the
enemy
country
every
inch
of
the
way
was
stubbornly
contested
by
the
defenders
but
slowly
they
were
pushed
back
staggering
under
the
shocks
of
the
crimson
attack
chesney
rutland
and
murdoch
worked
together
side
by
side
like
one
man
or
forty
and
when
time
was
called
for
an
instant
on
the
yates
yards
it
was
to
bring
galt
the
blue
left
tackle
back
to
consciousness
and
send
him
limping
off
the
gridiron
his
place
in
the
line
was
taken
by
an
old
hilltonian
one
dunsmore
and
the
game
went
on
and
now
it
was
the
blue
that
was
in
full
retreat
and
the
crimson
that
pursued
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
yates
goal
line
went
the
resisting
besieged
and
the
conquering
besiegers
and
the
great
black
announced
but
eight
more
minutes
of
the
first
half
remaining
but
even
eight
were
three
more
than
were
needed
for
harwell
crossed
the
twenty
yards
by
tandem
on
tackle
gained
the
fifteen
in
two
downs
by
wedges
between
tackle
and
guard
and
from
there
on
until
the
goal
line
was
reached
never
paused
in
her
breathless
resistless
onslaught
it
was
wesley
blair
who
at
last
put
the
ball
over
for
a
going
through
between
center
and
left
guard
with
all
the
weight
of
the
harwell
eleven
behind
him
his
smothered
down
was
never
heard
for
the
west
stand
was
a
swaying
tumultuous
unit
of
thunderous
acclaim
up
went
the
flags
and
banners
of
crimson
hues
loud
sounded
the
paean
of
praise
and
thanksgiving
from
thousands
of
straining
throats
while
below
on
the
side
lines
the
coaches
leaped
for
joy
and
strained
each
other
to
their
breasts
in
unspeakable
delight
and
while
the
shouting
went
on
as
though
never
would
the
frenzied
shouters
cease
the
grim
panting
yates
players
lined
up
back
of
their
goal
line
on
tiptoe
ready
at
the
first
touch
of
the
ball
to
the
earth
to
spring
forward
and
leaping
upward
strive
to
arrest
the
speeding
oval
prone
upon
the
ground
the
ball
in
his
hands
lay
story
a
yard
or
two
distant
blair
directed
the
pointing
of
it
the
goal
was
a
most
difficult
one
from
an
angle
and
long
the
studied
and
directed
until
faint
groans
of
derision
arose
from
the
impatient
east
stand
and
the
men
behind
the
goal
line
moved
restively
lacing
to
you
said
blair
quietly
story
shifted
the
ball
imperceptibly
more
the
obeyed
cock
it
higher
went
the
end
toward
the
goal
not
so
much
it
was
lowered
carefully
slowly
steady
blair
stepped
back
glanced
once
swiftly
at
the
and
stepped
forward
again
down
story
left
hand
touched
the
grass
the
yates
men
surged
forward
there
was
a
thud
and
upward
sped
the
ball
rising
rising
until
it
topped
the
bar
then
slowly
turning
over
over
in
its
quickening
descent
but
the
nearly
silent
west
stand
had
broke
again
into
loud
cries
of
triumph
and
upon
the
face
of
the
scoreboard
appeared
the
momentous
word
goal
again
the
ball
was
put
in
play
but
the
half
was
soon
over
and
the
players
snatching
their
blankets
trotted
to
the
dressing
rooms
and
the
announced
opponents
yates
as
the
little
swinging
door
closed
behind
him
joel
found
himself
in
a
seething
mass
of
players
rubbers
and
coaches
while
a
babel
of
voices
greetings
commands
laughter
and
lament
confused
him
it
was
a
busy
scene
the
trainer
and
his
assistants
were
working
like
mad
the
doctor
and
the
head
coach
were
talking
twenty
to
the
second
everybody
was
explaining
everything
and
the
indefatigable
coaches
were
hurrying
from
man
to
man
instructing
reminding
and
scolding
joel
had
only
to
look
on
save
when
he
lent
a
hand
at
removing
some
torn
and
stubborn
jersey
or
at
finding
lost
and
nose
masks
and
so
he
found
a
seat
out
of
the
way
and
searching
the
room
with
his
gaze
at
length
found
prince
that
gentleman
was
having
a
nice
new
pink
elastic
bandage
put
about
his
ankle
he
was
grinning
sturdily
but
at
every
clutch
of
the
web
his
lips
twitched
and
his
brow
puckered
joel
watching
him
wondered
how
much
more
he
would
stand
and
whether
his
joel
chance
would
come
ere
the
fatal
whistle
piped
the
end
of
the
match
time
up
cried
the
head
coach
suddenly
and
the
confusion
redoubled
until
he
mounted
to
a
bench
and
clapped
his
hands
loudly
above
the
din
comparative
silence
ensued
fellows
he
began
here
the
list
for
the
next
half
answer
to
your
names
please
and
go
over
to
the
door
fellows
you
have
to
make
less
noise

murdoch
right
the
voice
emerged
from
the
folds
of
a
woolen
sweater
which
had
stubbornly
refused
to
go
on
or
off
with
a
smile
the
head
coach
continued
the
list
each
man
responding
as
his
name
was
announced
and
crowding
to
the
doorway
chesney

a
murmur
arose
from
the
listening
throng
and
chase
a
tall
youth
his
cheek
exhibiting
the
marks
of
a
contact
with
some
one
shoe
cleats
groaned
loudly
and
flung
himself
on
to
a
bench
where
he
sat
looking
blindly
before
him
until
the
list
was
finished
story
prince
here
called
the
latter
jumping
from
his
seat
then
a
sharp
agonized
cry
followed
and
prince
toppled
over
clutching
vainly
at
the
air
the
head
coach
paused
the
doctor
and
the
trainer
pushed
toward
the
fallen
man
and
a
moment
later
the
former
announced
quietly
he
fainted
sir
can
he
go
on
asked
the
head
coach
he
is
out
of
the

too
painful
i
could
allow
it
very
well
answered
the

as
he
amended

joel
heart
leaped
as
he

his

pronounced
and
he

demanded
the

impatiently
and
here
sir
gulped
joel
rushing
to
the
door
all
right
continued
the
head
coach
there
is
time
for
any
fine
phrases
fellows
and
if
there
was
i
could
say
them
so
that
they
do
any
good
you
know
what
you
got
to
do
go
ahead
and
do
it
you
have
the
chance
of
wiping
out
a
good
many
defeats
more
than
it
pleasant
to
think
about
the
college
expects
a
great
deal
from
you
do
disappoint
it

keep
your

now
fellows
times
three
for

and
what
a
cheer
that
was
the
little
building
shook
the
men
stood
on
their
toes
the
head
coach
cheered
himself
off
the
bench
and
joel
yelled
so
desperately
that
his
breath
gave
out
at
the
last
rah
and
did
come
back
until
the
little
door
was
burst
open
and
he
found
himself
leaping
the
fence
into
the
gridiron
and
what
a
burst
of
sound
greeted
their
reappearance
the
west
stand
shook
from
end
to
end
crimson
banners
broke
out
on
the
breeze
every
one
was
on
his
feet
hats
waved
umbrellas
clashed
canes
swirled
a
youth
in
a
plaid
ulster
went
purple
in
the
face
at
the
small
end
of
a
horn
and
for
all
the
sound
it
seemed
to
make
it
might
as
well
have
been
a
penny
whistle
the
ushers
waved
their
arms
but
to
no
purpose
since
the
seats
heeded
them
not
at
all
but
shouted
as
their
hearts
dictated
and
as
their
throats
and
lungs
allowed
joel
gazing
about
him
from
the
field
felt
a
shiver
of
emotion
pass
through
him
they
were
cheering
he
was
one
of
the
little
band
in
honor
of
which
the
flags
waved
the
voices
shouted
and
the
songs
were
sung
he
felt
a
lump
growing
in
his
throat
and
to
keep
down
the
tears
that
for
some
reason
were
creeping
into
his
eyes
he
let
drive
at
a
ball
that
came
bumping
toward
him
and
kicked
it
so
hard
that
selkirk
had
to
chase
it
half
down
the
field
harwell
harwell
harwell
harwell
the
leaders
of
the
cheering
had
again
gotten
control
of
their
sections
and
the
long
deliberate
cheer
majestic
in
its
intensity
of
sound
crashed
across
the
space
rebounded
from
the
opposite
stand
and
went
echoing
upward
into
the
clear
afternoon
air
harwell
muttered
joel
then
he
gathered
with
the
others
about
dutton
to
listen
to
that
leader
last
instructions
and
at
the
same
moment
the
east
stand
broke
into
cheers
as
the
gallant
sons
of
yates
bounded
on
to
the
grass
back
and
forth
rolled
the
mighty
torrents
of
sound
meeting
in
midair
breaking
and
crashing
back
in
fainter
reverberations
they
were
singing
the
college
songs
now
and
the
merits
and
virtues
of
both
colleges
were
being
chanted
defiantly
to
the
tunes
of
popular
airs
thousands
of
feet
keeping
time
against
the
stands
the
yates
band
and
the
harwell
band
were
striving
from
opposite
ends
of
the
field
to
drown
each
other
strains
and
the
blue
and
crimson
fluttered
and
waved
the
sun
sank
lower
toward
the
western
horizon
and
the
shadows
crept
along
the
ground
there
will
be
just
one
more
score
predicted
the
knowing
ones
as
they
buttoned
their
ulsters
and
overcoats
up
at
the
throat
and
crouched
along
the
side
lines
like
so
many
toads
but
who
will
make
it
i
blessed
if
i
know
then
harwell
lined
up
along
the
line
with
the
ball
in
their
possession
and
the
south
goal
behind
them
and
yates
scattered
down
the
field
in
front
and
the
linesmen
placed
their
canes
in
the
turf
the
referee
and
the
umpire
walked
into
the
field
and
the
stands
grew
silent
save
for
the
shrill
voice
of
a
little
freshman
on
the
west
stand
who
had
fallen
two
bars
behind
in
this
is
harwell
day
and
needs
must
finish
out
while
his
breath
lasted
are
you
all
ready
asked
the
referee
there
was
no
reply
only
here
and
there
a
foot
moved
uneasily
as
weights
were
thrown
forward
and
there
was
a
general
almost
imperceptible
tightening
of
nerves
and
muscles
and
then
the
whistle
blew
chapter

harwell
yates
a
fault
and
a
requital
the
came
into

the
interference
formed
quickly
and
the
sped
down
the
field
one
white
line
passed
under

another
joel
felt
blair
hand
laid
lightly
upon
his
shoulder
and
ran
as
though
life
itself
depended
upon
getting
that
precious
ball
past
the
third
mark
but
the
yates
ends
were
upon
them
joel
gave
the
shoulder
to
one
but
the
second
dived
through
kingdon
and
the
runner
came
to
earth
on
the
line
with
joel
tugging
at
him
in
the
hope
of
advancing
the
pigskin
another

up
quickly
fellows
called

the
players
jumped
to
their
places
joel
crept
back
a
bare
yard
kingdon
leaped
forward
snugged
the
ball
under
his
arm
and
followed
by
joel
tried
to
find
a
hole
inside
left
end
but
the
hole
was
not
there
and
the
ball
was
instantly
in
the
center
of
a
pushing
grinding
mass
down
no
gain
story
worming
his
way
through
the
jumble
clapped
his
hands
chesney
was
already
stooping
over
the
ball
joel
ran
to
his
position
and
the
quarter
threw
a
rapid
glance
behind
him
he
placed
his
hand
on
the
center
broad
back
the
ball
was
snapped
joel
darted
toward
the
center
took
the
leather
at
a
hand
pass
crushed
it
against
the
pit
of
his
stomach
and
followed
the
left
end
through
a
breach
in
the
living
wall
strong
hands
pushed
him
on
then
he
came
bang
against
a
huge
shoulder
was
seized
by
the
yates
right
half
and
thrown
he
hugged
the
ball
as
the
players
crashed
down
upon
him
third
down
called
the
referee
three
yards
to
gain
line
up
fellows
line
up
called
the
impatient
story
and
joel
jumped
to
his
feet
upsetting
the
last
man
in
the
and
scurried
back
back
sped
blair
up
ran
joel
and
kingdon
the
line
blocked
desperately
a
streak
of
brown
flew
by
and
a
moment
later
joel
heard
the
thud
as
the
shoe
struck
the
ball
then
down
the
field
he
sped
through
the
great
gap
made
by
the
yates
forwards
the
harwell
ends
were
well
under
the
kick
and
stood
waiting
grimly
beside
the
yates
as
the
ball
settled
to
earth
as
it
thudded
against
his
canvas
jacket
and
as
he
started
to
run
three
pairs
of
arms
closed
about
him
and
he
went
down
in
his
tracks
the
ball
lay
on
line
the
field
streamed
up
the
big
yates
center
took
the
ball
joel
crept
up
behind
the
line
his
hands
on
the
broad
forms
in
front
dodging
back
and
forth
behind
murdoch
and
selkirk
the
opposing
left
half
started
across
took
the
ball
and
then
why
then
joel
was
at
the
very
bottom
of
some
seven
hundred
pounds
of
writhing
humanity
trying
his
best
to
get
his
breath
and
wondering
where
the
ball
was
second
down
three
and
a
half
yards
to
gain
again
the
lines
faced
joel
was
crouched
close
to
quarter
obeying
that
player
gesture
they
were
going
to
try
murdoch
again
joel
heard
the
breathless
tones
of
the
yates
quarter
as
he
stooped
behind
the
opposing
line
a
tandem
on
guard
whispered
joel
to
himself
the
next
moment
there
was
a
crash
the
man
in
front
of
him
gave
then
joel
and
story
gripping
the
turf
with
their
toes
braced
hard
there
was
a
moment
of
heaving
panting
suspense
then
a
smothered
voice
cried
down
third
down
cried
the
referee
three
and
a
half
yards
to
gain
look
out
for
a
fake
kick
muttered
story
as
joel
fell
back
the
opposing
line
was
quickly
formed
and
again
the
signal
was
given
the
rush
line
heaved
joel
sprang
into
the
air
settling
with
a
crash
against
the
shoulders
of
chesney
and
murdoch
who
went
forward
carrying
the
defense
before
them
but
the
ball
was
passed
and
even
as
the
yates
line
broke
the
thud
of
leather
against
leather
was
heard
joel
scrambled
to
his
feet
assisted
by
chesney
and
streaked
up
the
field
the
ball
was
overhead
describing
a
high
short
arch
blair
was
awaiting
it
and
kingdon
was
behind
and
to
the
right
of
him
down
it
came
out
shot
blair
hands
and
catching
it
like
a
baseball
he
was
off
at
a
jump
kingdon
beside
him
joel
swung
about
gave
a
shoulder
to
an
oncoming
rusher
ran
slowly
until
the
two
backs
were
hard
behind
him
and
then
dashed
on
surely
there
was
no
way
through
that
crowded
field
yet
even
as
he
studied
his
path
a
pair
of
blue
stockings
went
into
the
air
and
a
threatening
obstacle
was
out
of
the
way
bowled
over
by
a
harwell
forward
the
ends
were
now
scouting
ahead
of
the
runners
engaging
the
enemy
the
line
was
traversed
at
an
angle
near
the
east
side
of
the
field
and
joel
saw
the
touch
line
growing
instantly
more
imminent
but
a
waiting
yates
man
crouchingly
running
up
the
line
was
successfully
passed
and
the
trio
bore
farther
infield
putting
ten
more
precious
yards
behind
them
the
west
stand
was
wild
with
exultant
excitement
and
joel
found
himself
speeding
onward
in
time
with
the
rhythmic
sway
of
the
deep
that
boomed
across
from
the
farther
side
but
the
enemy
was
fast
closing
in
about
them
the
yates
right
half
was
plunging
down
from
the
long
side
a
pertinacious
forward
was
almost
at
their
heels
and
now
the
yates
full
was
charging
obliquely
at
them
with
his
eyes
staring
his
jaw
set
and
determination
in
every
feature
and
line
the
hand
on
joel
shoulder
dropped
blair
eased
his
pace
by
ever
so
little
and
joel
shot
forward
in
the
track
of
the
full
his
head
down
and
the
next
moment
was
sprawling
on
the
turf
with
the
enemy
above
him
but
he
saw
and
heard
blair
and
kingdon
hurdling
over
felt
a
sharp
pain
that
was
instantly
forgotten
and
knew
that
the
ball
was
safely
by
but
the
run
was
over
at
the
next
line
kingdon
made
a
heroic
effort
to
down
the
half
and
would
have
succeeded
had
it
not
been
for
the
persevering
forward
who
reached
him
with
his
long
arms
and
pulled
him
to
earth
and
blair
the
ball
safe
beneath
him
lay
at
the
yates
yards
the
holding
his
head
to
earth
joel
arose
and
as
he
trotted
to
his
position
he
looked
curiously
at
the
first
finger
of
his
left
hand
it
bore
the
imprint
of
a
and
pained
dully
he
tried
to
stretch
it
but
could
not
then
he
shook
his
hand
the
finger
wobbled
crazily
joel
grinned
bust
he
whispered
laconically
his
first
impulse
was
to
ask
for
time
to
have
it
bound
then
he
recollected
that
some
one
had
said
the
doctor
was
very
strict
about
injuries
perhaps
the
latter
would
consider
the
break
sufficient
cause
for
joel
leaving
the
field
that
would
do
better
to
play
with
a
broken
arm
than
not
to
play
at
all
so
he
tried
to
stick
the
offending
hand
in
his
pocket
found
there
was
no
pocket
there
and
put
the
finger
in
his
mouth
instead
then
he
forgot
all
about
it
for
harwell
was
hammering
the
blue
line
desperately
and
joel
had
all
he
could
do
to
remember
the
signals
and
play
his
position
for
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
the
ball
hovered
about
yates
danger
territory
twice
by
the
hardest
kind
of
line
bucking
it
was
placed
within
the
line
and
twice
by
the
grimmest
most
desperate
resistance
it
was
lost
on
downs
and
sent
hurtling
back
to
near
but
yates
was
on
the
defensive
even
when
the
oval
was
in
her
possession
and
harwell
experienced
the
pleasurable
and
in
truth
unaccustomed
exultation
that
comes
with
the
assurance
of
superiority
harwell
greatest
plays
now
were
the
two
sequences
from
ordinary
formation
and
forward
these
were
used
over
and
over
ever
securing
territory
and
ever
puzzling
the
opponents
joel
was
hard
worked
he
was
used
not
only
to
wriggle
around
the
line
inside
of
ends
and
to
squirm
through
difficult
outlets
but
to
charge
the
line
as
well
a
feat
of
which
his
height
and
strong
legs
rendered
him
well
capable
he
proved
a
consistant
and
with
blair
who
worked
like
a
hero
and
kingdon
who
won
laurels
for
himself
that
remained
fresh
many
years
gained
the
distance
time
and
again
but
although
the
spectacular
performances
belonged
here
to
the
backs
the
line
it
was
that
made
such
work
possible
chesney
with
his
six
feet
four
and
a
half
inches
of
muscle
and
his
two
hundred
and
pounds
of
weight
stood
like
a
veritable
gibraltar
of
strength
beside
him
rutland
was
scarcely
less
invulnerable
and
murdoch
on
the
other
side
played
like
a
veteran
which
he
was
not
being
only
a
sophomore
with
but
one
hundred
and
pounds
to
keep
him
from
blowing
away
selkirk
gave
way
to
lee
when
the
half
was
two
thirds
over
but
burbridge
played
it
out
and
then
owned
up
to
a
broken
shoulder
bone
and
was
severely
lectured
by
the
trainer
the
head
coach
and
the
doctor
in
turn
and
worshiped
by
the
whole
college
captain
dutton
played
a
dashing
brilliant
game
at
left
end
and
secured
for
himself
a
that
held
no
dissenting
vote
and
barton
at
the
other
end
of
the
red
line
tried
his
best
to
fill
the
place
of
the
deposed
chase
and
if
he
did
not
fully
succeed
at
least
failed
not
from
want
of
trying
but
it
was
little
story
the
who
won
unfading
glory
a
mass
of
nerves
from
his
head
down
his
brain
was
as
clear
and
cool
as
the
farthest
goal
post
and
he
ran
the
team
in
a
manner
that
made
the
coaches
hopping
and
scrambling
along
on
the
side
lines
hug
themselves
and
each
other
in
glee
so
much
for
the
harwell
men
as
for
yates
what
words
are
eloquent
enough
to
do
justice
to
the
heroic
determined
defense
she
made
there
under
the
shadow
of
her
own
goal
when
defeat
seemed
every
moment
waiting
to
overwhelm
her
every
man
in
that
line
and
back
of
it
was
a
hero
the
kind
that
history
loves
to
tell
of
the
right
guard
morris
was
a
pitiable
sight
as
with
white
drawn
face
he
stood
up
under
the
terrific
assault
staggering
with
eyes
to
hold
the
line
joel
was
heartily
glad
when
presently
he
fell
up
against
the
big
yates
center
after
a
fierce
attack
at
his
position
and
was
supported
half
fainting
from
the
field
the
substitute
was
a
lighter
man
as
the
next
try
at
his
position
showed
and
the
gains
through
the
hole
still
went
on
yates
team
now
held
four
substitutes
although
with
the
exception
of
douglas
the
substitute
none
of
them
was
perceptibly
inferior
to
the
men
whose
places
they
took
the
cheering
from
the
harwell
seats
was
now
continuous
and
the
refrain
of
glory
glory
for
the
crimson
was
repeated
over
and
over
on
the
east
stand
the
yates
supporters
were
neither
hopeless
nor
silent
their
cheers
were
given
with
a
will
and
encouraged
their
gallant
warriors
to
renewed
and
ever
more
desperate
defense
the
proclaimed
the
game
almost
done
with
six
minutes
left
it
only
remained
as
it
seemed
for
yates
to
hold
the
plunging
crimson
once
more
at
the
last
ditch
to
keep
the
game
a
tie
and
so
win
what
would
under
the
circumstances
have
been
as
good
as
a
victory
down
came
the
harwell
line
once
more
to
the
twenty
yards
but
here
they
stopped
for
on
a
pass
from
quarter
to
left
half
the
latter
one
joel
march
of
our
acquaintance
fumbled
the
ball
dived
quickly
after
it
and
landed
on
the
yates
left
guard
who
had
plunged
through
and
now
lay
with
the
pigskin
safe
beneath
him
it
is
difficult
to
either
describe
or
appreciate
the
full
depth
of
joel
agony
as
he
picked
himself
up
and
limped
back
to
his
place
it
was
a
blinding
sensation
that
left
him
weak
and
limp
but
there
was
nothing
for
it
save
to
go
on
and
try
to
retrieve
his
fatal
error
the
white
face
of
story
turned
toward
him
and
joel
read
in
the
brief
glance
no
anger
only
an
almost
tearful
grief
he
swung
upon
his
heel
with
a
muttered
word
that
sounded
ill
from
his
lips
but
he
was
only
a
boy
and
the
provocation
was
great
let
us
not
remember
it
against
him
the
yates
center
threw
back
the
ball
for
a
kick
and
joel
went
down
the
field
after
it
as
he
ran
he
wondered
if
story
would
try
him
again
it
seemed
doubtful
but
if
he
did
joel
ground
his
teeth
he
would
take
it
through
the
line
they
would
see
just
give
him
one
chance
to
retrieve
that
fumble
a
year
later
and
he
had
learned
that
a
misplay
even
though
it
lose
the
game
for
your
side
may
in
time
be
lived
down
but
now
that
knowledge
was
not
his
and
a
picture
of
disgrace
before
the
whole
college
presented
itself
to
him
then
blair
had
the
ball
was
off
was
tackled
near
the
side
line
under
the
yates
stand
and
the
two
teams
were
quickly
lined
up
again
the
cheers
from
the
friends
of
the
blue
were
so
loud
that
the
voice
giving
the
signal
was
scarcely
to
be
heard
joel
crept
nearer
then
his
heart
leaped
up
into
his
throat
and
stood
still
there
was
no
mistake
it
was
left
half
ball
on
a
double
pass
for
a
run
around
right
end
the
was
within
eight
yards
of
the
east
side
line
the
play
was
the
third
of
the
second
sequence
in
which
joel
with
the
other
backs
had
been
well
instructed
and
its
chance
of
success
lay
in
the
fact
that
it
had
the
appearance
of
a
punt
or
a
run
around
the
long
side
of
the
field
joel
leaned
forward
facing
the
left
end
blair
crept
a
few
feet
in
began
the
quarter
the
ball
was
snapped
blair
ran
three
strides
nearer
the
quarter
turned
and
the
pigskin
flew
back
joel
started
like
a
shot
seized
the
ball
from
the
outstretched
hands
and
sped
toward
the
right
end
of
the
line
the
right
half
crossed
in
front
of
him
the
right
end
and
tackle
thrust
back
their
opponents
the
left
tackle
and
guard
blocked
hard
and
long
blair
helped
the
right
half
in
his
diversion
at
the
left
end
and
joel
with
dutton
interfering
and
blair
a
stride
behind
swept
around
the
end
the
only
danger
was
in
being
forced
over
the
touch
line
but
the
play
worked
well
and
the
opposing
tackle
seemed
anchored
the
yates
end
from
his
place
back
of
the
line
leaped
at
them
but
was
upset
by
dutton
and
the
two
went
down
together
the
opposing
left
half
bore
down
upon
joel
and
blair
the
latter
speeding
along
at
the
runner
side
and
came
at
them
with
outstretched
arms
another
moment
and
joel
was
alone
story
and
the
half
were
just
a
mass
of
waving
legs
and
arms
many
yards
behind
joy
was
the
supreme
sensation
in
joel
breast
only
the
yates
threatened
the
ball
was
safely
clutched
in
his
right
arm
his
breath
came
easily
his
legs
were
strong
and
the
loomed
far
down
the
field
and
beckoned
him
on
this
he
thought
exultingly
was
the
best
moment
that
life
could
give
him
behind
although
he
could
not
hear
it
for
the
din
of
shouting
from
the
harwell
stand
he
knew
the
pursuit
to
be
in
full
cry
he
edged
farther
out
from
the
dangerous
touch
line
and
sped
on
the
yates
had
been
deceived
by
the
play
and
had
gone
far
up
the
field
for
a
kick
and
now
down
he
came
and
joel
found
a
chill
creeping
over
him
as
he
remembered
the
player
wide
reputation
he
was
the
finest
so
report
had
it
of
the
year
and
of
a
sudden
joel
found
his
breath
growing
labored
and
his
long
legs
began
to
ache
and
seemed
stiffening
at
the
thighs
and
knees
but
he
only
ran
the
faster
and
prepared
for
the
threatened
tackle
harwell
hearts
sank
for
the
runner
appeared
to
waver
to
be
slowing
down
suddenly
when
only
his
own
length
separated
him
from
his
prey
the
yates
left
the
ground
and
like
a
swimmer
diving
into
the
sea
dove
for
the
hesitating
runner
there
was
but
one
thing
that
day
more
beautiful
to
see
than
that
fearless
attempt
to
tackle
and
that
one
thing
was
the
leap
high
into
the
air
that
the
harwell
left
half
made
just
in
the
nick
of
time
clearing
the
tackler
barely
avoiding
a
fall
and
again
running
free
with
the
ball
still
safe
the
yates
player
quickly
recovered
and
took
up
the
chase
and
the
momentary
pause
had
served
to
bring
the
foremost
of
the
other
pursuers
almost
to
joel
heels
and
now
began
a
contest
that
will
ever
live
in
the
memories
of
those
who
witnessed
it
panting
weary
his
legs
aching
at
every
bound
his
throat
parching
with
the
hot
breath
joel
struggled
on
joy
had
given
place
to
fear
and
desperation
time
and
again
he
choked
down
the
sobs
behind
him
sounded
the
thud
of
relentless
feet
he
dared
not
look
back
lest
he
stumble
every
second
he
expected
to
feel
the
clutch
of
the
enemy
every
second
he
thought
that
he
must
give
up
but
recollection
of
that
fumble
crushed
down
each
time
the
inclination
to
yield
and
one
after
another
the
nearly
obliterated
lines
passed
under
foot
he
gave
up
trying
to
breathe
it
was
too
hard
his
head
was
swimming
and
his
lungs
seemed
bursting
then
his
wandering
faculties
rushed
back
at
a
bound
as
he
felt
a
touch
just
the
lightest
fingering
on
his
shoulder
and
gathering
all
his
remaining
strength
he
increased
his
pace
for
a
few
steps
and
the
hand
was
gone
and
the
line
passed
slowly
reluctantly
one
more
he
thought
one
more
the
great
stands
were
hoarse
with
shouting
for
here
ended
the
game
the
figures
on
the
had
changed
since
the
last
play
and
now
relentlessly
proclaimed
one
minute
left
nearer
and
nearer
crept
the
line
nearer
and
nearer
crept
the
pursuing
then
and
at
the
same
instant
the
scattered
breadth
of
lime
was
gone
and
a
hand
clutched
at
the
canvas
jacket
of
the
harwell
runner
once
more
joel
called
upon
his
strength
and
tried
to
draw
away
but
it
was
no
use
and
with
the
goal
line
but
four
yards
distant
stout
arms
were
clasped
tightly
about
his
waist
one
two
three
strides
he
made
the
goal
line
writhed
before
his
dizzy
sight
relentlessly
the
clutching
grasp
fastened
tighter
and
tighter
about
him
like
steel
bands
and
settled
lower
and
lower
until
his
legs
were
clasped
and
he
could
move
no
farther
despairingly
he
thrust
the
ball
out
at
arms
length
and
tried
to
throw
himself
forward
the
trampled
turf
rose
to
meet
him
the
ball
is
over
pronounced
the
referee
it
was
a
nice
decision
for
an
inch
would
have
made
a
world
of
difference
but
it
has
never
been
disputed
then
dutton
leaped
into
the
air
waving
his
arms
rutland
turned
a
somersault
and
the
west
stand
arose
as
one
man
and
went
mad
with
delight
hats
and
cushions
soared
into
air
the
great
structure
shook
and
trembled
from
end
to
end
and
the
last
few
golden
rays
of
the
setting
sun
glorified
the
waving
fluttering
bank
of
triumphant
crimson

the

the

marched
after

perhaps
not
all
the
college
i
have
heard
that
a
senior
living
in
lanter
was
too
ill
to
be
present
but
the
incoming
platform
was
thronged
from
wall
to
track
so
it
was
perhaps
as
well
that
he
did
come
because
there
positively
room
for
him
what
is

asked
a
citizen
in
a
silk
hat
of
a
gayly
decorated
youth
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
the
latter
stared
for
full
a
minute
ere
the
words
came
then
he
cried
here
a
fellow
who
wants
to
know
what
we
here
for
and
a
great
groan
of
derision
went
up
to
the
arching
roof
and
the
ignorant
person
slunk
away
yet
not
before
his
silk
hat
had
been
pushed
gently
but
firmly
far
down
over
his
eyes

the

crashed
up
against

and
thundered
back
and
none
heard
the
shriek
of
the
incoming
train
as
it
clattered
over
the
switches
at
the
entrance
of
the
shed
and
none
saw
it
until
it
was
creeping
in
the
engineer
leaning
far
out
of
the
cab
window
and
waving
a
red
bandanna
handkerchief
a
courtesy
that
won
him
a
cheer
all
to
himself
then
out
tumbled
the
returning
heroes
bags
in
hands
followed
by
the
head
coach
and
all
the
rest
of
the
attendant
train
and
then
what
a
pushing
and
shouting
and
struggling
there
was
there
were
forty
men
to
every
player
and
the
result
was
that
some
of
the
latter
were
nearly
torn
limb
from
limb
ere
they
were
safe
out
of
reach
on
the
shoulders
of
lucky
contestants
for
the
honor
of
carrying
them
the
first
stage
of
the
journey
to
college
there
were
some
who
tried
to
hide
some
who
tried
to
run
others
who
enjoyed
the
whole
thing
hugely
and
thumped
the
heads
of
their
bearers
heartily
just
to
show
good
feeling
joel
was
one
of
the
last
to
leave
the
car
and
as
he
set
foot
on
the
platform
a
hundred
voices
went
up
in
cheers
and
a
hundred
students
struggled
for
possession
of
him
but
one
there
was
who
from
his
place
of
vantage
halfway
up
the
steps
repelled
all
oncomers
and
assisted
by
a
second
youth
of
large
proportions
seized
upon
joel
and
setting
him
upon
their
shoulders
bore
him
off
in
triumph
boom
boom
said
the
big
drum
and
the
procession
started
down
the
long
platform
it
went
past
the
waiting
room
doors
where
a
crowd
of
onlookers
waved
hats
and
handkerchiefs
and
so
out
into
the
city
street
joel
turned
his
head
away
from
the
observers
ashamed
and
happy
there
was
no
to
the
cheering
one
after
another
the
names
of
the
players
and
substitutes
coaches
and
trainer
were
cheered
and
cheered
again
out
of
the
way
there
cried
joel
bearers
and
the
marching
throng
looked
about
moved
apart
and
as
joel
was
borne
through
cheered
him
to
the
echo
reaching
eager
hands
toward
him
crying
words
of
commendation
and
praise
into
his
buzzing
ears
march
one
shrieked
a
youth
near
where
joel
soon
found
himself
at
the
head
of
the
procession
and
the
slogan
was
taken
up

now
give

joel
cried
the
youth
upon
whose
left
shoulder
he
was
swaying
joel
obeyed
smiling
affectionately
down
into
the
upraised
face
then
he
uttered
a
cry
of
pain
one
of
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
was
bandaged
and
outfield
west
dropped
it
gingerly
not
not
he
asked
wonderingly
joel
nodded
are
you
of
it
whispered
his
chum
yes
answered
joel
simply
and
earnestly
may
i
take
it
too
asked
the
other
youth
joel
started
and
looked
down
into
the
anxious
and
entreating
face
of
bartlett
cloud
he
grasped
the
hesitating
hand
that
was
held
up
yes
he
answered
smilingly
and
the
big
drum
boomed
and
the
shrill
fifes
tootled
and
the
crimson
banners
waved
upon
the
breeze
and
every
one
cheered
himself
hoarse
and
thus
the
conquering
heroes
came
back
to
the
college
that
loved
them
and
joel
a
little
tearful
when
no
one
was
looking
and
very
happy
always
was
borne
on
the
shoulders
of
west
and
cloud
friend
and
enemy
at
the
very
head
of
the
procession
