of

by

chapter
i
no
on
a
small
headland
of
the
distant
island
of
lewis
an
old
man
stood
looking
out
on
a
desolate
waste
of
sea
it
was
a
wild
and
wet
day
from
out
of
the
lowering
southwest
fierce
gusts
of
wind
were
driving
up
volumes
and
flying
rags
of
clouds
and
sweeping
onward
at
the
same
time
the
gathering
waves
that
fell
hissing
and
thundering
on
the
shore
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
sea
and
the
air
and
the
sky
seemed
to
be
one
indistinguishable
mass
of
whirling
and
hurrying
vapor
as
if
beyond
this
point
there
were
no
more
land
but
only
wind
and
water
and
the
confused
and
awful
voice
of
their
strife
the
short
man
who
stood
on
this
solitary
point
paid
little
attention
to
the
rain
that
ran
off
the
peak
of
his
cap
or
to
the
gusts
of
wind
that
blew
about
his
bushy
gray
beard
he
was
still
following
with
an
eye
accustomed
to
pick
out
objects
far
at
sea
one
speck
of
purple
that
was
now
fading
into
the
gray
mist
of
the
rain
and
the
longer
he
looked
the
less
it
became
until
the
mingled
sea
and
sky
showed
only
the
smoke
that
the
great
steamer
left
in
its
wake
as
he
stood
there
motionless
and
regardless
of
everything
around
him
did
he
cling
to
the
fancy
that
he
could
still
trace
out
the
path
of
the
vanished
ship
a
little
while
before
it
had
passed
almost
close
to
him
he
had
watched
it
steam
out
of
stornoway
harbor
as
the
sound
of
the
engines
came
nearer
and
the
big
boat
went
by
so
that
he
could
have
almost
called
to
it
there
was
no
sign
of
emotion
on
the
hard
and
stern
face
except
perhaps
that
the
lips
were
held
firm
and
a
sort
of
frown
appeared
over
the
eyes
he
saw
a
tiny
white
handkerchief
being
waved
to
him
from
the
deck
of
the
vessel
and
he
said
almost
as
though
he
were
addressing
some
one
there
good
little
girl
but
in
the
midst
of
that
roaring
of
the
sea
and
the
wind
how
could
any
such
message
be
delivered
and
already
the
steamer
was
away
from
the
land
standing
out
to
the
lonely
plain
of
waters
and
the
sound
of
the
engines
had
ceased
and
the
figures
on
the
deck
had
grown
faint
and
visionary
but
still
there
was
that
one
speck
of
white
visible
and
the
man
knew
that
a
pair
of
eyes
that
had
many
a
time
looked
into
his
own
as
if
with
a
faith
that
such
intercommunion
could
never
be
broken
were
now
trying
through
overflowing
and
blinding
tears
to
send
him
a
last
look
of
farewell
the
gray
mists
of
the
rain
gathered
within
their
folds
the
big
vessel
and
all
the
beating
hearts
it
contained
and
the
fluttering
of
that
little
token
disappeared
with
it
all
that
remained
was
the
sea
whitened
by
the
rushing
of
the
wind
and
the
thunder
of
waves
on
the
beach
the
man
who
had
been
gazing
so
long
down
into
the
southeast
turned
his
face
landward
and
set
out
to
walk
over
a
tract
of
wet
grass
and
sand
toward
a
road
that
ran
near
by
there
was
a
large
wagonette
of
varnished
oak
and
a
pair
of
small
powerful
horses
waiting
for
him
there
and
having
dismissed
the
boy
who
had
been
in
charge
he
took
the
reins
and
got
up
but
even
yet
the
fascination
of
the
sea
and
of
that
sad
farewell
was
upon
him
and
he
turned
once
more
as
if
now
that
sight
could
yield
him
no
further
tidings
he
would
send
her
one
more
word
of
poor
little
sheila
that
was
all
he
said
and
then
he
turned
to
the
horses
and
sent
them
on
with
his
head
down
to
escape
the
rain
and
a
look
on
his
face
like
that
of
a
dead
man
as
he
drove
through
the
town
of
stornoway
the
children
playing
within
the
shelter
of
the
cottage
doors
called
to
each
other
in
a
whisper
and
said
is
the
king
of
but
the
elderly
people
said
to
each
other
with
a
shake
of
the
head
iss
a
bad
day
this
day
for
mackenzie
that
he
will
be
going
home
to
an
empty
house
and
it
will
be
a
ferry
bad
thing
for
the
poor
folk
of
borva
and
they
will
know
a
great
difference
now
that
miss
sheila
iss
gone
away
and
there
is
nobody
not
anybody
at
all
left
in
the
island
to
tek
the
side
of
the
poor
he
looked
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
though
he
was
known
to
many
of
the
people
as
he
drove
away
from
the
town
into
the
heart
of
the
lonely
and
desolate
land
the
wind
had
so
far
died
down
and
the
rain
had
considerably
lessened
but
the
gloom
of
the
sky
was
deepened
by
the
drawing
on
of
the
afternoon
and
lay
heavily
over
the
dreary
wastes
of
moor
and
hill
what
a
wild
and
dismal
country
was
this
which
lay
before
and
all
around
him
now
that
the
last
traces
of
human
occupation
were
passed
there
was
not
a
cottage
not
a
stone
wall
not
a
fence
to
break
the
monotony
of
the
long
undulations
of
moorland
which
in
the
distance
rose
into
a
series
of
hills
that
were
black
under
the
darkened
sky
down
from
those
mountains
ages
ago
glaciers
had
slowly
crept
to
eat
out
hollows
in
the
plains
below
and
now
in
those
hollows
were
lonely
lakes
with
not
a
tree
to
break
the
line
of
their
melancholy
shores
everywhere
around
were
the
traces
of
this
glacier
drift
great
gray
boulders
of
gneiss
fixed
fast
into
the
black
peat
moss
or
set
amid
the
browns
and
greens
of
the
heather
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
in
this
wilderness
of
rock
and
morass
was
the
rushing
of
various
streams
and
turbid
that
plunged
down
their
narrow
channels
to
the
sea
the
rain
now
ceased
altogether
but
the
mountains
in
the
far
south
had
grown
still
darker
and
to
the
fishermen
passing
by
the
coast
it
must
have
seemed
as
though
the
black
peaks
were
holding
converse
with
the
lowering
clouds
and
that
the
silent
moorland
beneath
was
waiting
for
the
first
roll
of
the
thunder
the
man
who
was
driving
along
this
lonely
route
sometimes
cast
a
glance
down
toward
this
threatening
of
a
storm
but
he
paid
little
heed
to
it
the
reins
lay
loose
on
the
backs
of
the
horses
and
at
their
own
pace
they
followed
hour
after
hour
the
rising
and
falling
road
that
led
through
the
moorland
and
past
the
gloomy
lakes
he
may
have
recalled
mechanically
the
names
of
those
stretches
of
water
the
lake
of
the
sheiling
the
lake
of
the
oars
the
lake
of
the
fine
sand
and
so
forth
to
measure
the
distance
he
had
traversed
but
he
seemed
to
pay
little
attention
to
the
objects
around
him
and
it
was
with
a
glance
of
something
like
surprise
that
he
suddenly
found
himself
overlooking
that
great
on
the
western
side
of
the
island
in
which
was
his
home
he
drove
down
the
hill
to
the
solitary
little
inn
of
at
the
door
muffled
up
in
a
warm
woolen
plaid
stood
a
young
girl
and
diffident
in
look
mackenzie
she
said
with
that
peculiar
and
pleasant
intonation
that
marks
the
speech
of
the
hebridean
who
has
been
taught
english
in
the
schools
was
miss
sheila
wrote
to
me
to
suainabost
and
she
said
i
might
come
down
from
suainabost
and
see
if
i
can
be
of
any
help
to
you
in
the
the
girl
was
crying
although
the
blue
eyes
looked
bravely
through
the
tears
as
if
to
disprove
the
fact
my
good
lass
he
said
putting
his
hand
gently
on
her
head
it
wass
sheila
wrote
to
you
sir
and
i
hef
come
down
from
is
a
lonely
house
you
will
be
going
to
he
said
absently
miss
sheila
said
i
wass
i
wass
to
but
here
the
young
girl
failed
in
her
effort
to
explain
that
miss
sheila
had
asked
her
to
go
down
to
make
the
house
less
lonely
the
elderly
man
in
the
wagonette
seemed
scarcely
to
notice
that
she
was
crying
he
bade
her
come
up
beside
him
and
when
he
had
got
her
into
the
wagonette
he
left
some
message
with
the
innkeeper
who
had
come
to
the
door
and
drove
off
again
they
drove
along
the
high
land
that
overlooks
a
portion
of
loch
roag
with
its
wonderful
network
of
islands
and
straits
and
then
they
stopped
on
the
lofty
plateau
of
callernish
where
there
was
a
man
waiting
to
take
the
wagonette
and
horses
you
would
be
seeing
miss
sheila
away
sir
said
the
man
it
was
duncan
macdonald
will
say
that
she
will
not
come
back
no
more
to
the
old
man
with
the
big
gray
beard
only
frowned
and
passed
on
he
and
the
girl
made
their
way
down
the
side
of
the
rocky
hill
to
the
shore
and
here
there
was
an
open
boat
awaiting
them
when
they
approached
a
man
considerably
over
six
feet
in
height
and
sinewy
in
frame
jumped
into
the
big
and
rough
boat
and
began
to
get
ready
for
their
departure
there
was
just
enough
wind
to
catch
the
brown
mainsail
and
the
king
of
borva
took
the
tiller
his
henchman
sitting
down
by
the
mast
and
no
sooner
had
they
left
the
shore
and
stood
out
towards
one
of
the
channels
of
this
arm
of
the
sea
than
the
tall
spare
keeper
began
to
talk
of
that
which
made
his
eye
grow
dark
well
he
said
in
the
plaintive
drawling
of
his
race
it
iss
an
empty
house
you
will
be
going
to
mackenzie
and
it
iss
a
bad
thing
for
us
all
that
miss
sheila
hass
gone
away
and
it
iss
ta
time
she
will
hef
been
wiss

this
very
boat

mackenzie

access
of
fury

and
child
on
the
island

of
nothing
but
sheila
i
will
drive
my
foot
through
the
bottom
of
the
boat
if
you
do
not
hold
your
peace
the
tall
gillie
patiently
waited
until
his
master
had
exhausted
his
passion
and
then
he
said
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
it
will
not
do
much
good
mackenzie
to
tek
ta
name
god
in
vain
and
there
will
be
much
more
of
trinking
in
ta
island
and
it
will
be
a
great
difference
mirover
and
she
will
be
so
far
away
that
no
one
will
see
her
no
more
far
away
beyond
ta
sound
of
sleat
and
far
away
beyond
oban
as
i
hef
heard
people
say
and
what
will
she
do
in
london
when
she
has
no
boat

she
will
never
go
out
to

fishing
and
i
will
hear
people
say
that
you
will
walk
a
whole
day
and
never
come
to
ta
sea
and
what
will
miss
sheila
do
for
that
and
she
will
tame
no
more
ta
wild
young
things
and
she
will
find
out
no
more
ta
nests
in
the
rocks
and
she
will
hef
no
more
horns
when
the
deer
is
killed
and
she
will
go
out
no
more
to
see
ta
cattle
swim
across

roag
when
they
go
to

sheilings
it
will
be
all
different
all
different
now
and
she
will
never
see

no
more
and
it
iss
as
bad
as
if
you
was
a
poor
man
mackenzie
and
had
to
let
your
sons
and
your
daughters
go
away
to
america
and
never
come

no
more
and
she
ta
only
one
in
your
house
and
it
wass
the
son
of
macintyre
of
sutherland
he
would
have
married

and
come
to
live

ta
island
and
not
have
miss
sheila
go
away
among
strangers
that
doesna
ken
her
family
and
will
put
no
store
by
her
no
more
than
if
she
was
a
lass
it
wass
miss
sheila
herself
had
a
sore
heart
tis
morning
when
she
went
away
and
she
turned
and
she
looked
at
borva
as
the
boat
came
away
and
i
said
iss
the
last
time
miss
sheila
will
be
in
her
boat
and
she
will
not
come
no
more
again
to
mackenzie
heard
not
one
word
or
syllable
of
all
this
the
dead
passionless
look
had
fallen
over
the
powerful
features
and
the
eyes
were
gazing
not
on
the
actual
loch
roag
before
them
but
on
a
stormy
sea
that
lies
between
lewis
and
skye
and
on
a
vessel
disappearing
in
the
midst
of
the
rain
it
was
by
a
sort
of
instinct
that
he
guided
this
open
boat
through
the
channels
which
were
now
getting
broader
as
they
neared
the
sea
and
the
tall
and
keeper
might
have
kept
up
his
garrulous
talk
for
hours
without
attracting
a
look
or
a
word
it
was
now
the
dusk
of
the
evening
and
wild
and
strange
indeed
was
the
scene
around
the
solitary
boat
as
it
slowly
moved
along
large
islands
so
large
that
any
one
of
them
might
have
been
mistaken
for
the
mainland
lay
over
the
dark
waters
of
the
sea
remote
untenanted
and
silent
there
were
no
white
cottages
along
these
rocky
shores
only
a
succession
of
rugged
cliffs
and
sandy
bays
but
half
mirrored
in
the
sombre
water
below
down
in
the
south
the
mighty
shoulders
and
peaks
of
suainabhal
and
its
sister
mountains
were
still
darker
than
the
darkening
sky
and
when
at
length
the
boat
had
got
well
out
from
the
network
of
islands
and
fronted
the
broad
waters
of
the
atlantic
the
great
plain
of
the
western
sea
seemed
already
to
have
drawn
around
it
the
solemn
mantle
of
the
night
you
go
to
borvapost
mackenzie
or
will
we
run
her
into
your
own
house
asked
duncan
borvapost
being
the
name
of
the
chief
village
on
the
island
will
not
go
on
to
borvapost
said
the
old
man
peevishly
they
not
have
plenty
to
talk
about
at
borvapost
it
iss
no
harm
tat
ta
folk
will
speak
of
miss
sheila
said
the
gillie
with
some
show
of
resentment
iss
no
harm
tey
will
be
sorry
she
is
gone
away
no
harm
at
all
for
it
was
many
things
tey
had
to
thank
miss
sheila
for
and
now
it
will
be
all
ferry
different
tell
you
duncan
macdonald
to
hold
your
peace
said
the
old
man
with
a
savage
glare
of
the
eyes
and
then
duncan
relapsed
into
a
sulky
silence
and
the
boat
held
on
its
way
in
the
gathering
twilight
a
long
gray
curve
of
sand
became
visible
and
into
the
bay
thus
indicated
mackenzie
turned
his
small
craft
this
indentation
of
the
island
seemed
as
blank
of
human
occupation
as
the
various
points
and
bays
they
had
passed
but
as
they
neared
the
shore
a
house
came
into
sight
about
half
way
up
the
slope
rising
from
the
sea
to
the
pasture
land
above
there
was
a
small
stone
pier
jutting
out
at
one
portion
of
the
bay
where
a
mass
of
rocks
was
embedded
in
the
white
sand
and
here
at
length
the
boat
was
run
in
and
mackenzie
helped
the
young
girl
ashore
the
two
of
them
leaving
the
gillie
to
moor
the
little
vessel
that
had
brought
them
from
callernish
went
silently
toward
the
shore
and
up
the
narrow
road
leading
to
the
house
it
was
a
square
substantial
building
of
stone
but
the
stone
had
been
liberally
oiled
to
keep
out
the
wet
and
the
blackness
thus
produced
had
not
a
very
cheerful
look
then
on
this
particular
evening
the
scant
bushes
surrounding
the
house
hung
limp
and
dark
in
the
rain
and
amid
the
prevailing
hues
of
purple
and
blue
the
bit
of
scarlet
coping
running
around
the
black
house
was
wholly
ineffective
in
relieving
the
general
impression
of
dreariness
and
desolation
the
king
of
borva
walked
into
a
large
room
which
was
but
partially
lit
by
two
candles
on
the
table
and
by
the
blaze
of
a
mass
of
peats
in
the
stone
and
threw
himself
into
a
big
then
he
suddenly
seemed
to
recollect
his
companion
who
was
timidly
standing
near
the
door
with
her
shawl
still
around
her
head
he
said
and
ask
them
to
give
you
some
dry
clothes
your
box
it
will
not
be
here
for
half
an
hour
then
he
turned
to
the
fire

lass

and
get

began
the
girl
diffidently
wass
miss
sheila
asked
me
she
asked
me
to
look
after
you
sir
with
that
he
rose
abruptly
and
advanced
to
her
and
caught
her
by
the
wrist
he
spoke
quite
quietly
to
her
but
the
eyes
looking
up
at
the
stern
face
were
a
trifle
frightened
are
a
ferry
good
little
girl
mairi
he
said
slowly
you
will
mind
what
i
say
to
you
you
will
do
what
you
like
in
the
house
you
will
take
place

much

macdonald
and
she
will
give

and
bring
up

the
piper
and
and
the
lads
of
the
if
they
are
not
gone
home
to
habost
yet
but
it
iss
john
the
piper
must
come
the
girl
went
away
to
seek
counsel
of
scarlett
macdonald
wife
and
mackenzie
proceeded
to
walk
up
and
down
the
big
and
chamber
then
he
went
to
the
cupboard
and
put
out
on
the
table
a
number
of
tumblers
and
glasses
with
two
or
three
bottles
of
norwegian
make
consisting
of
four
semicircular
tubes
of
glass
meeting
at
top
and
bottom
leaving
the
center
of
the
vessel
thus
formed
open
he
stirred
up
the
blazing
peats
in
the
he
brought
down
from
a
shelf
a
box
filled
with
coarse
tobacco
and
put
it
on
the
table
but
he
was
evidently
growing
impatient
and
at
last
he
put
on
his
cap
again
and
went
out
into
the
night
the
air
blew
cold
in
from
the
sea
and
whistled
through
the
bushes
that
sheila
had
trained
about
the
porch
there
was
no
rain
now
but
a
great
and
heavy
darkness
brooded
overhead
and
in
the
silence
he
could
hear
the
breaking
of
the
waves
along
the
hard
coast
but
what
was
this
other
sound
he
heard
wild
and
strange
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
a
shrill
and
plaintive
cry
that
the
distance
softened
until
it
almost
seemed
to
be
the
calling
of
a
human
voice
surely
those
were
words
he
heard
or
was
it
only
that
the
old
sad
air
spoke
to
him
for
lochaber
no
more
lochaber
no
more
maybe
to
return
to
lochaber
no
more
that
was
the
message
that
came
to
him
out
of
the
darkness
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
sea
and
the
night
and
the
sky
were
wailing
over
the
loss
of
his
sheila
he
walked
away
from
the
house
and
up
the
hill
behind
led
by
the
sound
of
the
pipes
that
grew
louder
and
more
unearthly
as
he
approached
he
found
himself
at
length
on
a
bit
of
high
overlooking
the
sea
where
sheila
had
had
a
rude
bench
of
iron
and
wood
fixed
into
the
rock
on
this
bench
sat
a
little
old
man
humpbacked
and
bent
and
with
long
white
hair
falling
down
to
his
shoulders
he
was
playing
the
pipes
not
wildly
and
fiercely
as
if
he
were
at
a
of
the
lads
come
home
from
the
caithness
fishing
nor
yet
gaily
and
proudly
as
if
he
were
marching
at
the
head
of
a
bridal
procession
but
slowly
mournfully
monotonously
as
though
he
were
having
the
pipes
talk
to
him
mackenzie
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
and
the
old
man
started
it
you
mckenzie
he
said
in
gaelic
is
a
great
fright
you
have
given
down
to
the
house
john
the
lads
from
habost
and
alister
and
some
more
will
be
coming
and
you
will
get
a
ferry
good
dram
john
to
put
wind
in
the
no
dram
thinking
of
mackenzie
said
the
old
man
you
will
have
plenty
of
company
without
me
but
i
will
come
down
to
the
house
mackenzie
oh
yes
i
will
come
down
to
the
house
but
a
little
i
will
come
to
the
mackenzie
turned
from
him
with
a
petulant
exclamation
and
went
along
and
down
the
hill
rapidly
as
he
could
hear
voices
in
the
darkness
he
had
just
got
into
the
house
when
his
visitors
arrived
the
door
of
the
room
was
opened
and
there
appeared
some
six
or
eight
tall
and
stalwart
men
mostly
with
profuse
brown
beards
and
faces
who
advanced
into
the
chamber
with
some
show
of
shyness
mackenzie
offered
them
a
rough
and
hearty
welcome
and
as
soon
as
their
eyes
had
got
accustomed
to
the
light
bade
them
help
themselves
to
the
whisky
on
the
table
with
a
certain
solemnity
each
poured
out
a
glass
and
drank
to
his
host
as
if
it
were
some
funeral
rite
but
when
he
bade
them
replenish
their
glasses
and
got
them
seated
with
their
faces
to
the
blaze
of
the
peats
then
the
flood
of
gaelic
broke
loose
had
the
wise
little
girl
from
suainabost
warned
these
big
men
there
was
not
a
word
about
sheila
uttered
all
their
talk
was
of
the
reports
that
had
come
from
caithness
and
of
the
improvements
of
the
small
harbor
near
the
butt
and
of
the
black
that
had
been
seen
in
lock
suainabhal
and
of
some
more
sheep
having
been
found
dead
on
the
pladda
isles
shot
by
the
men
of
the
english
smacks
pipes
were
lit
the
peat
stirred
up
anew
another
glass
or
two
of
whisky
drunk
and
then
through
the
haze
of
the
smoke
the
brown
faces
of
the
men
could
be
seen
in
eager
controversy
each
talking
faster
than
the
other
and
comparing
facts
and
fancies
that
had
been
brooded
over
through
solitary
nights
of
waiting
on
the
sea
mackenzie
did
not
sit
down
with
them
he
did
not
even
join
them
in
their
attention
to
the
curious
he
paced
up
and
down
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
occasionally
being
appealed
to
with
a
story
or
question
and
showing
by
his
answers
that
he
was
but
vaguely
hearing
the
vociferous
talk
of
his
companions
at
last
he
said
the
teffle
does
not
john
the
piper
come
here
you
men
you
sing
a
song
quick
none
of
your
funeral
songs
but
a
good
brisk
one
of
trinking
and
but
were
not
nearly
all
their
songs
like
those
of
all
dwellers
on
a
rocky
and
dangerous
coast
of
a
sad
and
sombre
hue
telling
of
maidens
whose
lovers
were
drowned
and
of
wives
bidding
farewell
to
husbands
they
were
never
to
see
again
slow
and
mournful
are
the
songs
that
the
northern
fishermen
sing
as
they
set
out
in
the
evening
with
the
creaking
of
the
long
oars
keeping
time
to
the
music
until
they
get
out
beyond
the
shore
to
hoist
the
red
mainsail
and
catch
the
breeze
blowing
over
from
the
regions
of
the
sunset
not
one
of
these
habost
fishermen
could
sing
a
brisk
song
but
the
nearest
approach
to
it
was
a
ballad
in
praise
of
a
girl
which
they
owning
the
were
bound
to
know
and
so
one
young
fellow
began
to
sing
nighean
dubh
boidheach
dubh
mo
nighean
dubhna
treig
mi
in
a
slow
and
doleful
fashion
and
the
others
joined
in
the
chorus
with
a
like
solemnity
in
order
to
keep
time
four
of
the
men
followed
the
common
custom
of
taking
a
pocket
handkerchief
in
this
case
an
immense
piece
of
brilliant
red
silk
which
was
evidently
the
pride
of
its
owner
and
holding
it
by
the
four
corners
letting
it
slowly
rise
and
fall
as
they
sang
the
other
three
men
laid
hold
of
a
bit
of
rope
which
they
used
for
the
same
purpose
nighean
dubh
unlike
most
of
the
gaelic
songs
has
but
a
few
verses
and
as
soon
as
they
were
finished
the
young
fellow
who
seemed
pleased
with
his
performance
started
another
ballad
perhaps
he
had
forgotten
his
injunction
perhaps
he
knew
no
merrier
song
but
at
any
rate
he
began
to
sing
the
of
it
was
one
of
songs
she
had
sung
it
the
night
before
in
this
very
room
and
her
father
had
listened
to
her
describing
the
fate
of
young
monaltrie
as
if
she
had
been
foretelling
her
own
and
scarcely
dared
to
ask
himself
if
ever
again
he
should
hear
the
voice
that
he
loved
so
well
he
could
not
listen
to
the
song
he
abruptly
left
the
room
and
went
out
once
more
into
the
cool
and
the
darkness
but
even
here
he
was
not
allowed
to
forget
the
sorrow
he
had
been
vainly
endeavoring
to
banish
for
in
the
far
distance
the
pipes
still
played
the
melancholy
wail
of
lochaber
lochaber
no
more
lochaber
no
more
that
was
the
only
solace
brought
him
by
the
winds
from
the
sea
and
there
were
tears
running
down
the
hard
gray
face
as
he
said
to
himself
in
a
broken
voice
my
little
girl
why
did
you
go
away
from
borva
chapter
ii
the
stranger
you
must
be
in
love
with
her
yourself
in
love
with
her
sheila
and
i
are
too
old
friends
for
that
the
speakers
were
two
young
men
seated
in
the
stern
of
the
steamer
clansman
as
she
ploughed
her
way
across
the
blue
and
rushing
waters
of
the
minch
one
of
them
was
a
tall
young
fellow
of
with
fair
hair
and
light
blue
eyes
whose
delicate
and
mobile
features
were
handsome
enough
in
their
way
and
gave
evidence
of
a
nature
at
once
sensitive
nervous
and
impulsive
he
was
clad
in
light
gray
from
head
to
heel
a
color
that
suited
his
fair
complexion
and
yellow
hair
and
he
lounged
about
the
white
deck
in
the
glare
of
the
sunlight
steadying
himself
from
time
to
time
as
an
unusually
big
wave
carried
the
clansman
aloft
for
a
second
or
two
and
then
sent
her
staggering
and
groaning
into
a
hissing
trough
of
foam
now
and
again
he
would
pause
in
front
of
his
companion
and
talk
in
a
rapid
playful
and
even
eloquent
fashion
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
apparently
a
trifle
annoyed
by
the
slow
and
patient
attention
which
greeted
his
oratorical
efforts
would
start
off
once
more
on
his
unsteady
journey
up
and
down
the
white
planks
the
other
was
a
man
of
of
middle
height
sallow
complexion
and
generally
insignificant
appearance
his
hair
was
becoming
prematurely
gray
he
rarely
spoke
he
was
dressed
in
a
suit
of
rough
blue
cloth
and
indeed
looked
somewhat
like
a
pilot
who
had
gone
ashore
taken
to
study
and
never
recovered
himself
a
stranger
would
have
noticed
the
tall
and
fair
young
man
who
walked
up
and
down
the
gleaming
deck
evidently
enjoying
the
brisk
breeze
that
blew
about
his
yellow
hair
and
the
sunlight
that
touched
his
pale
and
fine
face
or
sparkled
on
his
teeth
when
he
laughed
but
would
have
paid
little
attention
to
the
smaller
man
who
lay
back
on
the
bench
with
his
two
hands
clasped
around
his
knee
and
with
his
eye
fixed
on
the
southern
heavens
while
he
murmured
to
himself
the
lines
of
some
ridiculous
old
devonshire
ballad
or
replied
in
monosyllables
to
the
rapid
and
eager
talk
of
his
friend
both
men
were
good
sailors
and
they
had
need
to
be
for
although
the
sky
above
them
was
as
blue
and
clear
as
the
heart
of
the
sapphire
and
although
the
sunlight
shone
on
the
decks
and
the
rigging
a
strong
had
been
blowing
all
the
morning
and
there
was
a
considerable
sea
on
the
far
blue
plain
was
whitened
with
the
tumbling
crests
of
the
waves
that
shone
and
sparkled
in
the
sun
and
ever
and
anon
a
volume
of
water
would
strike
the
bow
rise
high
in
the
air
with
the
shock
and
fall
in
heavy
showers
over
the
forward
decks
sometimes
too
a
wave
caught
her
broadside
and
sent
a
handful
of
spray
over
the
two
or
three
passengers
who
were
safe
in
the
stern
but
the
decks
here
remained
silvery
and
white
for
the
sun
and
wind
speedily
dried
up
the
traces
of
the
at
length
the
taller
of
the
young
men
came
and
sat
down
by
his
companion
far
to
stornoway
yet
jove
what
a
distance
all
day
yesterday
getting
up
from
oban
to
skye
all
last
night
churning
our
way
up
to
loch
gair
all
crossing
to
this
outlandish
island
that
seems
as
far
away
as
iceland
and
for
what
you
remember
the
moonlight
last
night
as
we
sailed
by
the
cuchullins
and
the
sunrise
this
morning
as
we
lay
in
loch
gair
were
not
these
worth
coming
that
was
not
what
you
came
for
my
dear
friend
no
you
came
to
carry
off
this
wonderful
miss
sheila
of
yours
and
of
course
you
wanted
somebody
to
look
on
and
here
i
am
ready
to
carry
the
ladder
and
the
dark
lantern
and
the
i
will
saddle
your
steeds
for
you
and
row
you
over
lakes
and
generally
do
anything
to
help
you
in
so
romantic
an
is
very
kind
of
you
lavender
said
the
other
with
a
smile
such
adventures
are
not
for
old
fogies
like
me
they
are
the
exclusive
right
of
young
fellows
like
you
who
are
tall
and
have
plenty
of
money
and
good
spirits
and
have
a
way
with
you
that
all
the
world
admires
of
course
the
bride
will
tread
a
measure
with
you
of
course
all
the
bridesmaids
would
like
to
see
you
marry
her
of
course
she
will
taste
the
cup
you
offer
her
then
a
word
in
her
ear
and
away
you
go
as
if
it
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
and
as
if
the
bridegroom
was
a
despicable
creature
merely
because
god
had
only
given
him
five
feet
six
inches
but
you
have
a
lochinvar
five
feet
the
younger
man
blushed
like
a
girl
and
laughed
a
little
and
was
evidently
greatly
pleased
nay
in
the
height
of
his
generosity
he
began
to
protest
he
would
not
have
his
friend
imagine
that
women
cared
only
for
stature
and
good
looks
there
were
other
qualities
he
himself
had
observed
the
most
singular
conquests
made
by
men
who
were
not
but
who
had
a
certain
fascination
about
them
his
own
experience
of
women
was
considerable
and
he
was
quite
certain
that
the
best
women
now
the
sort
of
women
whom
a
man
would
respect
the
women
who
had
brains
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
the
other
listened
quite
gravely
to
these
kindly
blundering
explanations
and
only
one
who
watched
his
face
narrowly
could
have
detected
in
the
brown
eyes
a
sort
of
amused
consciousness
of
the
intentions
of
the
amiable
and
ingenuous
youth
you
really
mean
to
tell
me
ingram
continued
lavender
in
his
rapid
and
impetuous
way
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
are
not
in
love
with
this
highland
princess
for
ages
back
you
have
talked
of
nothing
but
sheila
how
many
an
hour
have
i
spent
in
clubs
up
the
river
down
at
the
coast
everywhere
listening
to
your
stories
of
sheila
and
your
praises
of
sheila
and
your
descriptions
of
sheila
it
was
always
sheila
and
again
sheila
and
still
again
sheila
but
do
you
know
either
you
exaggerated
or
i
failed
to
understand
your
descriptions
for
the
sheila
i
came
to
construct
out
of
your
talk
is
a
most
incongruous
and
incomprehensible
creature
first
sheila
knows
about
stone
and
lime
and
building
and
then
i
suppose
her
to
be
a
practical
young
woman
who
is
a
sort
of
overseer
to
her
father
but
sheila
again
is
romantic
and
mysterious
and
believes
in
visions
and
dreams
and
then
i
take
her
to
be
an
affected
but
then
sheila
can
throw
a
fly
and
play
her
and
sheila
can
adventure
upon
the
lochs
in
an
open
boat
managing
the
sail
herself
and
then
i
find
her
to
be
a
but
again
sheila
is
shy
and
rarely
speaks
but
looks
unutterable
things
with
her
soft
and
magnificent
eyes
and
what
does
that
mean
but
that
she
is
an
ordinary
young
lady
who
has
not
been
in
society
and
who
is
a
little
interesting
if
a
little
stupid
while
she
is
unmarried
and
who
after
marriage
calmly
and
complacently
sinks
into
the
dull
domestic
hind
whose
only
thought
is
of
bills
and
perambulators
this
was
a
fairly
long
speech
but
it
was
no
longer
than
many
which
frank
lavender
was
accustomed
to
utter
when
in
the
vein
for
talking
his
friend
and
companion
did
not
pay
much
heed
his
hands
were
still
clasped
around
his
knee
his
head
leaning
back
and
all
the
answer
he
made
was
to
repeat
apparently
to
himself
these
not
very
pertinent
lines
ockington
in
devonsheer
my
vather
he
lived
vor
many
a
yeer
and
i
his
son
with
him
did
dwell
to
tend
his
sheep
doleful
well
know
ingram
it
must
be
precious
hard
for
man
who
has
to
knock
about
in
society
and
take
his
wife
with
him
to
have
to
explain
to
everybody
that
she
is
in
reality
a
most
unusual
and
gifted
young
person
and
that
she
must
not
be
expected
to
talk
it
is
all
very
well
for
him
in
his
own
house
that
is
to
say
if
he
can
preserve
all
the
sentiment
that
made
her
shyness
fine
and
wonderful
before
their
marriage
but
a
man
owes
a
little
to
society
even
in
choosing
a
another
pause
happened
on
a
zartin
day
the
sheep
they
rinned
astray
says
vather
to
i
rin
arter
du
says
i
to
vather
darned
if
i
du
you
are
the
sort
of
a
man
i
should
think
who
would
never
get
careless
about
your
wife
you
would
always
believe
about
her
what
you
believed
at
first
and
i
dare
say
you
would
live
very
happily
in
your
own
house
if
she
was
a
decent
sort
of
woman
but
you
would
have
to
go
out
into
society
sometimes
and
the
very
fact
that
you
had
not
got
careless
as
many
men
would
leaving
their
wives
to
produce
any
sort
of
impression
they
might
would
make
you
vexed
that
the
world
could
not
value
your
wife
as
you
fancy
she
ought
to
be
valued
you
see
this
was
the
answer
much
at
my
rude
tongue
a
dish
brath
at
me
he
vlung
which
so
incensed
me
to
wrath
that
i
up
knack
un
instantly
to
arth
for
your
princess
sheila
i
firmly
believe
you
have
some
romantic
notion
of
marrying
her
and
taking
her
up
to
london
with
you
if
you
seriously
intend
such
a
thing
i
shall
not
argue
with
you
i
shall
praise
her
by
the
hour
together
for
i
may
have
to
depend
on
edward
ingram
for
my
admission
to
your
house
but
if
you
only
have
the
fancy
as
a
fancy
consider
what
the
result
would
be
you
say
she
has
never
been
to
a
school
that
she
has
never
had
the
companionship
of
a
girl
of
her
own
age
that
she
has
never
read
a
newspaper
that
she
has
never
been
out
of
this
island
and
that
almost
her
sole
society
has
been
that
of
her
mother
who
educated
her
and
tended
her
and
left
her
as
ignorant
of
the
real
world
as
if
she
had
lived
all
her
life
in
a
lighthouse
goodness
gracious
what
a
figure
such
a
girl
would
cut
in
south
kensington
dear
fellow
said
ingram
at
last
be
absurd
you
will
soon
see
what
are
the
relations
between
sheila
mackenzie
and
me
and
you
will
be
satisfied
i
marry
her
do
you
think
i
would
take
the
child
to
london
to
show
her
its
extravagance
and
shallow
society
and
break
her
heart
with
thinking
of
the
sea
and
of
the
rude
islanders
she
knew
and
of
their
hard
and
bitter
struggle
for
life
no
i
should
not
like
to
see
my
wild
highland
doe
shut
up
in
one
of
your
southern
parks
among
your
tame
she
would
look
at
them
askance
she
would
separate
herself
from
them
and
by
and
by
she
would
make
one
wild
effort
to
escape
and
kill
herself
that
is
not
the
fate
in
store
for
our
good
little
sheila
so
you
need
not
make
yourself
unhappy
about
her
or
me
all
ye
young
men
of
every
persuasion
never
quarl
your
vather
upon
any
occasion
for
instead
of
being
better
vind
be
wuss
for
kick
you
out
doors
without
a
varden
in
your
puss
of
devonshire
how
is
that
young
american
lady
you
met
at
torquay
in
the
spring
now
is
the
sort
of
woman
a
man
would
be
safe
in
marrying
how
well
you
know
said
frank
lavender
mean
the
sort
of
woman
who
would
do
you
credit
hold
her
own
in
society
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
must
meet
her
some
day
i
tell
you
ingram
you
will
be
delighted
and
charmed
with
her
manners
and
her
grace
and
the
clever
things
she
says
at
least
everybody
else
well
seem
to
care
much
for
brilliant
women
remarked
the
other
rather
disappointed
that
his
companion
showed
so
little
interest
yes
i
like
brilliant
women
very
well
a
clever
woman
is
always
a
pleasanter
companion
than
a
clever
man
but
you
were
talking
of
the
choice
of
a
wife
and
pertness
in
a
girl
although
it
may
be
amusing
at
the
time
may
become
something
else
by
and
by
indeed
i
advise
a
young
man
to
marry
an
epigrammatist
for
you
see
her
shrewdness
and
smartness
are
generally
the
result
of
experiences
in
which
has
had
no
may
be
something
in
that
said
lavender
of
course
you
know
with
a
widow
it
is
different
and
lorraine
never
does
go
in
for
the
the
pale
blue
cloud
that
had
for
some
time
been
lying
faintly
along
the
horizon
now
came
nearer
and
more
near
until
they
could
pick
out
something
like
the
configuration
of
the
island
its
bays
and
promontories
and
mountains
the
day
seemed
to
become
warmer
as
they
got
out
of
the
driving
wind
of
the
channel
and
the
heavy
roll
of
the
sea
had
so
far
subsided
through
comparatively
calm
water
the
great
clansman
drove
her
away
until
on
getting
near
the
land
and
under
shelter
of
the
peninsula
of
eye
the
voyagers
found
themselves
on
a
beautiful
blue
plain
with
the
spacious
harbor
of
stornoway
opening
out
before
them
there
on
the
one
side
lay
a
white
and
cleanly
town
with
its
shops
and
quays
and
shipping
above
the
bay
in
front
stood
a
great
gray
castle
surrounded
by
and
terraces
and
gardens
while
on
the
southern
side
the
harbor
was
overlooked
by
a
of
hills
planted
with
every
variety
of
tree
the
white
houses
the
blue
bay
and
the
large
gray
building
set
amid
green
terraces
and
overlooked
by
wooded
hills
formed
a
bright
and
lively
little
picture
on
this
fresh
and
brilliant
forenoon
and
young
lavender
who
had
a
quick
eye
for
compositions
which
he
was
always
about
to
undertake
but
which
never
appeared
on
canvas
declared
enthusiastically
that
he
would
spend
a
day
or
two
in
stornoway
on
his
return
from
borva
and
take
home
with
him
some
sketch
of
the
place
is
miss
sheila
on
the
quay
yonder
he
asked
likely
said
ingram
is
a
long
drive
across
the
island
and
i
suppose
she
would
remain
at
home
to
look
after
our
dinner
in
the
the
wonderful
princess
sheila
look
after
our
dinner
has
she
visions
among
the
pots
and
pans
and
does
she
look
unutterable
things
when
she
is
peeling
potatoes
ingram
laughed
will
a
pretty
alteration
in
your
tune
in
a
couple
of
days
you
are
sure
to
fall
in
love
with
her
and
sigh
desperately
for
a
week
or
two
you
always
do
when
you
meet
a
woman
anywhere
but
it
hurt
you
much
and
she
wont
know
anything
about
should
rather
like
to
fall
in
love
with
her
to
see
how
furiously
jealous
you
would
become
however
here
we
there
is
mackenzie
the
man
with
the
big
gray
beard
and
the
peaked
cap
and
he
is
talking
to
the
chamberlain
of
the
does
he
get
up
on
his
wagonette
for
instead
of
coming
on
board
to
meet
you
that
is
one
of
his
little
tricks
said
ingram
with
a
smile
means
to
receive
us
in
state
and
impress
you
a
stranger
with
his
dignity
the
good
old
fellow
has
a
hundred
harmless
ways
like
that
and
you
must
humor
him
he
has
been
accustomed
to
be
treated
you
the
papa
of
the
mysterious
princess
is
not
perfect
i
ought
to
tell
you
now
that
oddest
notion
is
that
he
has
a
wonderful
skill
in
managing
men
and
in
concealing
the
manner
of
his
doing
it
i
tell
you
this
that
you
laugh
and
hurt
him
when
he
is
attempting
something
that
he
considers
particularly
crafty
and
that
a
child
could
see
what
is
the
aim
of
it
all
does
not
do
a
little
bet
occasionally
dear
no
he
is
the
best
and
honestest
fellow
in
the
world
but
it
pleases
him
to
fancy
that
he
is
profoundly
astute
and
that
other
people
see
the
artfulness
with
which
he
reaches
some
little
result
that
is
not
of
the
least
consequence
to
seems
to
me
remarked
mr
lavender
with
a
coolness
and
shrewdness
that
rather
surprised
his
companion
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
get
the
king
of
borva
to
assume
the
honors
of
a
the
steamer
was
moored
at
last
the
crowd
of
fishermen
and
loungers
drew
near
to
meet
their
friends
who
had
come
up
from
glasgow
for
there
are
few
strangers
as
a
rule
arriving
at
stornoway
to
whet
the
curiosity
of
the
islanders
and
the
tall
gillie
who
had
been
standing
by
horses
came
on
board
to
get
the
luggage
of
the
young
men
duncan
said
the
elder
of
them

lavender
giving
duncan
a
and
a
bag
he
had
brought
from
the
cabin
suppose
in
a
time
i
shall
begin
to
rave
about
her
too
look
sharp
ingram
and
let
us
have
audience
of
his
the
king
of
borva
fixed
his
eye
on
young
lavender
and
scanned
him
narrowly
as
he
was
being
introduced
his
welcome
of
ingram
had
been
most
gracious
and
friendly
but
he
received
his
companion
with
something
of
a
severe
politeness
he
requested
him
to
take
a
seat
beside
him
so
that
he
might
see
the
country
as
they
went
across
to
borva
and
lavender
having
done
so
ingram
and
duncan
got
into
the
body
of
the
wagonette
and
the
party
drove
off
passing
through
the
clean
and
bright
little
town
mackenzie
suddenly
pulled
up
his
horses
in
front
of
a
small
shop
in
the
windows
of
which
some
cheap
bits
of
jewelry
were
visible
the
man
came
out
and
mackenzie
explained
with
some
care
and
precision
that
he
wanted
a
silver
brooch
of
a
particular
sort
while
the
jeweler
had
returned
to
seek
the
article
in
question
frank
lavender
was
gazing
around
him
in
some
wonder
at
the
appearance
of
so
much
civilization
on
this
remote
and
rarely
visited
island
there
were
no
haggard
savages
unkempt
and
scantily
clad
coming
forth
from
their
dens
in
the
rocks
to
stare
wildly
at
the
strangers
on
the
contrary
there
was
a
prevailing
air
of
comfort
and
about
the
people
and
their
houses
he
saw
handsome
girls
with
hair
and
fresh
complexions
who
wore
short
and
thick
blue
petticoats
with
a
scarlet
tartan
shawl
wrapped
around
their
bosom
and
fastened
at
the
waist
stalwart
men
in
loose
blue
jacket
and
trowsers
and
scarlet
cap
many
of
them
with
bushy
red
beards
and
women
of
extraordinary
breadth
of
shoulder
who
carried
enormous
loads
in
a
creel
strapped
on
their
backs
while
they
employed
their
hands
in
contentedly
knitting
stockings
as
they
passed
along
but
what
was
the
purpose
of
these
mighty
loads
of
they
carried
burdens
that
would
have
appalled
a
railway
porter
of
the
south
will
see
sir
observed
the
king
of
borva
in
reply
to
question
is
not
much
of
the
phosphates
in
the
grass
of
this
island
and
the
cows
they
are
mad
to
get
the
to
lick
and
it
is
many
of
them
you
can
not
milk
unless
you
put
the
bones
before
why
do
the
lazy
fellows
lounging
about
there
let
the
women
carry
those
enormous
loads
mackenzie
stared
fellows
they
hef
harder
work
than
any
who
will
know
of
in
your
country
and
besides
the
fishing
they
will
do
the
ploughing
and
much
of
the
farm
work
and
iss
the
women
to
do
none
at
all
that
iss
the
nonsense
that
my
daughter
talks
but
she
has
got
it
out
of
books
and
what
do
they
know
how
the
poor
people
hef
to
live
at
this
moment
the
jeweler
returned
with
some
half
dozen
brooches
displayed
on
a
plate
and
shining
with
all
the
brilliancy
of
cairngorm
stones
polished
silver
and
pebbles
john
mackintyre
this
is
a
gentleman
from
london
said
mackenzie
regarding
the
jeweler
sternly
he
will
know
all
apout
such
fine
things
and
you
will
not
put
a
big
price
on
it
was
now
turn
to
stare
but
he
accepted
the
duties
of
referee
and
eventually
a
brooch
was
selected
and
paid
for
the
price
being
six
shillings
then
they
drove
on
again
will
know
nothing
of
this
it
will
be
a
great
surprise
for
her
said
mackenzie
almost
to
himself
as
he
opened
the
white
box
and
saw
the
glaring
piece
of
jewelry
lying
on
the
white
cotton
heavens
sir
cried
frank
lavender
mean
to
say
you
bought
that
brooch
for
your
daughter
why
not
said
the
king
of
borva
in
great
surprise
the
young
man
perceived
his
mistake
grew
considerably
confused
and
only
said
i
should
have
thought
that
that
some
small
piece
of
gold
jewelry
now
would
be
better
suited
for
a
young
mackenzie
smiled
shrewdly
had
something
to
go
on
it
was
sheila
herself
was
in
stornoway
three
weeks
ago
and
she
was
wanting
to
buy
a
brooch
for
a
young
girl
who
had
come
down
to
us
from
suainabost
and
is
very
useful
in
the
kitchen
and
it
wass
a
brooch
just
like
this
one
she
gave
to
to
a
said
the
young
man
meekly
mairi
is
cousin
said
mackenzie
with
continued
surprise
does
not
understand
highland
ways
yet
mackenzie
said
ingram
from
behind
know
we
in
the
south
have
different
fashions
our
servants
are
nearly
always
strangers
to
us
not
relations
and
i
hef
peen
in
london
myself
said
mackenzie
in
somewhat
of
an
injured
tone
and
then
he
added
with
a
touch
of
satisfaction
i
hef
been
in
paris
miss
sheila
has
she
been
in
london
asked
lavender
feigning
ignorance
has
never
been
out
of
the
you
think
the
education
of
a
young
lady
should
include
some
little
experience
of
traveling
she
will
be
educated
quite
enough
and
is
she
going
to
london
or
paris
without
me
might
take
have
too
much
to
do
on
the
island
now
and
sheila
has
much
to
do
i
do
not
think
she
will
ever
see
any
of
those
places
and
she
will
not
be
much
the
two
young
men
off
for
their
holidays
a
brilliant
day
shining
all
around
them
the
sweet
air
of
the
sea
and
the
moorland
blowing
about
them
this
little
party
that
now
drove
away
from
stornoway
ought
to
have
been
in
the
best
of
spirits
and
indeed
the
young
fellow
who
sat
beside
mackenzie
was
bent
on
pleasing
his
host
by
praising
everything
he
saw
he
praised
the
gallant
little
horses
that
whirled
them
past
the
plantations
and
into
the
open
country
he
praised
the
rich
black
peat
that
was
visible
in
long
lines
and
heaps
where
the
townspeople
were
slowly
eating
into
the
moorland
then
all
these
traces
of
occupation
were
left
behind
and
the
travelers
were
alone
in
the
untenanted
heart
of
the
island
where
the
only
sounds
audible
were
the
humming
of
insects
in
the
sunlight
and
the
falling
of
the
streams
away
in
the
south
the
mountains
were
of
a
silvery
and
transparent
blue
nearer
at
hand
the
rich
reds
and
browns
of
the
moorland
softened
into
a
tender
and
beautiful
green
on
nearing
the
margins
of
the
lakes
and
these
stretches
of
water
were
now
as
fair
and
bright
as
the
sky
above
them
and
were
scarcely
ruffled
by
the
moorfowl
moving
out
from
the
green
rushes
still
nearer
at
hand
great
masses
of
white
rock
lay
embedded
in
the
soft
soil
and
what
could
have
harmonized
better
with
the
rough
and
surface
than
the
patches
of
that
grew
up
in
the
clefts
or
hung
over
their
summits
the
various
and
beautiful
colors
around
seemed
to
tingle
with
light
and
warmth
as
the
clear
sun
shone
on
them
and
the
keen
mountain
air
blew
over
them
and
the
king
of
borva
was
so
far
thawed
by
the
enthusiasm
of
his
companions
that
he
regarded
the
fair
country
with
a
pleased
smile
as
if
the
enchanted
land
belonged
to
him
and
as
if
the
wonderful
colors
and
the
exhilarating
air
and
the
sweet
perfumes
were
of
his
own
creation
mackenzie
did
not
know
much
about
tints
and
hues
but
he
believed
what
he
heard
and
it
was
perhaps
after
all
not
very
surprising
that
a
gentleman
from
london
who
had
skill
of
pictures
and
other
delicate
matters
should
find
strange
marvels
in
a
common
stretch
of
moor
with
a
few
lakes
here
and
there
and
some
lines
of
mountains
only
good
for
sheilings
it
was
not
for
him
to
check
the
raptures
of
his
guest
he
began
to
be
friendly
with
the
young
man
and
could
not
help
regarding
him
as
a
more
cheerful
companion
than
his
neighbor
ingram
who
would
sit
by
your
side
for
an
hour
at
a
time
without
breaking
the
monotony
of
the
tramp
with
a
single
remark
he
had
formed
a
poor
opinion
of
physique
from
the
first
glimpse
he
had
of
his
white
fingers
and
complexion
but
surely
a
man
who
had
such
a
vast
amount
of
good
spirits
and
such
a
rapidity
of
utterance
must
have
something
corresponding
to
these
qualities
in
substantial
bone
and
muscle
there
was
something
pleasing
and
ingenuous
too
about
this
flow
of
talk
men
who
had
arrived
at
years
of
wisdom
and
knew
how
to
study
and
use
their
fellows
were
not
to
be
led
into
these
betrayals
of
their
secret
opinions
but
for
a
young
man
what
could
be
more
pleasing
than
to
see
him
lay
open
his
soul
to
the
observant
eye
of
a
master
of
men
mackenzie
began
to
take
a
great
fancy
to
young
lavender
said
lavender
with
a
fine
color
mantling
in
his
cheeks
as
the
wind
caught
them
on
a
higher
portion
of
the
road
had
heard
of
lewis
as
a
most
bleak
and
desolate
island
flat
moorland
and
lake
without
a
hill
to
be
seen
and
everywhere
i
see
hills
and
yonder
are
great
mountains
which
i
hope
to
get
nearer
before
we
have
mountains
in
this
island
remarked
mackenzie
slowly
as
he
kept
his
eye
on
his
companion
have
mountains
in
this
island
sixteen
thousand
feet
lavender
looked
sufficiently
astonished
and
the
old
man
was
pleased
he
paused
for
a
moment
or
two
and
said
this
iss
the
way
of
it
you
will
see
that
the
middle
of
the
mountains
it
has
all
been
washed
away
by
the
weather
and
you
will
only
have
the
sides
now
dipping
one
way
and
the
other
at
each
side
the
island
but
it
iss
a
very
clever
man
in
stornoway
will
tell
me
that
you
can
make
out
what
wass
the
height
the
mountain
by
watching
the
dipping
of
the
rocks
on
each
side
and
it
iss
an
older
country
this
island
than
any
you
will
know
of
and
there
were
the
mountains
sixteen
thousand
feet
high
long
before
all
this
country
and
all
scotland
and
england
wass
covered
with
the
young
man
was
very
desirous
to
show
his
interest
in
this
matter
but
did
not
know
very
well
how
at
last
he
ventured
to
ask
whether
there
were
any
fossils
in
the
blocks
of
gneiss
that
were
scattered
over
the
moorland
said
mackenzie
i
will
not
care
much
about
such
small
things
if
you
will
ask
sheila
she
will
tell
you
all
about
it
and
about
the
small
things
she
finds
growing
on
the
hills
that
is
not
of
much
consequence
to
me
but
i
will
tell
you
what
is
the
best
thing
the
island
grows
it
is
good
girls
and
strong
men
men
that
can
go
to
the
fishing
and
come
back
to
plough
the
fields
and
cut
the
peat
and
build
the
houses
and
leave
the
women
to
look
after
the
fields
and
the
gardens
when
they
go
back
again
to
the
fisheries
but
it
is
the
old
people
they
are
ferry
cunning
and
they
will
not
put
their
money
in
the
bank
at
stornoway
but
will
hide
it
away
about
the
house
and
then
they
will
come
to
sheila
and
ask
for
money
to
put
a
pane
of
glass
in
their
house
and
she
has
promised
that
to
every
one
who
will
make
a
window
in
the
wall
of
their
house
and
she
is
very
simple
with
them
and
does
not
understand
the
old
people
that
tell
lies
but
when
i
hear
of
it
i
say
nothing
to
sheila
she
will
know
nothing
about
it
but
i
have
a
watch
put
upon
the
people
and
it
was
only
yesterday
i
will
take
back
two
shillings
she
gave
to
an
old
woman
of
borvabost
that
told
many
lies
what
does
a
young
thing
know
of
these
old
people
she
will
know
nothing
at
all
and
it
is
better
for
some
one
else
to
look
after
them
but
not
to
speak
one
word
of
it
to
must
require
great
astuteness
to
manage
a
primitive
people
like
that
said
young
lavender
with
an
air
of
conviction
and
the
old
man
eagerly
and
proudly
assented
and
went
on
to
tell
of
the
manifold
diplomatic
arts
he
used
in
reigning
over
his
small
kingdom
and
how
his
subjects
lived
in
blissful
ignorance
that
this
controlling
power
was
being
exercised
they
were
startled
by
an
exclamation
from
ingram
who
called
to
mackenzie
to
pull
up
the
horses
just
as
they
were
passing
over
a
small
bridge
there
lavender
did
you
ever
see
salmon
jumping
like
that
look
at
the
size
of
them
it
iss
nothing
said
mackenzie
driving
on
again
you
will
see
the
salmon
it
is
in
the
narrows
of
loch
roag
where
they
come
into
the
rivers
and
the
tide
is
low
then
you
will
see
them
jumping
and
if
the
water
wass
too
low
for
a
long
time
they
will
die
in
hundreds
and
what
makes
them
jump
before
they
get
into
the
rivers
old
mackenzie
smiled
a
crafty
smile
as
if
he
had
found
out
all
the
ways
and
the
secrets
of
the
salmon
will
jump
to
look
about
them
that
iss
you
think
a
salmon
can
see
where
he
is
going
maybe
you
will
explain
this
to
me
then
said
the
king
with
a
compassionate
air
iss
it
the
salmon
will
try
to
jump
over
some
stones
in
the
river
and
he
will
see
he
go
over
them
but
does
he
fall
straight
down
on
the
stones
and
kill
himself
neffer
no
neffer
he
will
get
back
to
the
pool
he
left
by
turning
in
the
air
that
is
what
i
hef
seen
hundreds
of
times
they
must
be
able
to
fly
as
well
as
see
in
the
may
say
about
it
what
you
will
please
but
that
is
what
i
know
that
is
what
i
know
ferry
well
i
should
think
there
were
not
many
people
in
the
country
who
knew
more
about
salmon
than
you
said
frank
lavender
i
hear
too
that
your
daughter
is
a
great
but
this
was
a
blunder
the
old
man
frowned
will
tell
you
such
nonsense
sheila
has
gone
out
many
times
with
duncan
and
he
will
put
a
rod
in
her
hand
yes
and
she
will
have
caught
a
fish
or
two
but
it
iss
not
a
story
to
tell
my
daughter
she
will
have
plenty
to
do
about
the
house
without
any
of
such
nonsense
you
will
expect
to
find
us
all
savages
with
such
stories
of
am
sure
not
said
lavender
warmly
have
been
very
much
struck
with
the
civilization
of
the
island
so
far
as
i
have
seen
it
and
i
can
assure
you
i
have
always
heard
of
miss
sheila
as
a
singularly
accomplished
young
said
mackenzie
somewhat
mollified
has
been
well
brought
up
she
is
not
a
lass
running
about
wild
and
catching
the
salmon
i
can
not
listen
to
such
nonsense
and
it
iss
duncan
will
tell
can
assure
you
no
i
have
never
spoken
to
duncan
the
fact
is
ingram
mentioned
that
your
daughter
had
caught
a
salmon
or
two
as
a
tribute
to
her
skill
you
i
know
it
wass
duncan
said
mackenzie
with
a
deeper
frown
coming
over
his
face
will
hef
some
means
taken
to
stop
duncan
from
talking
such
the
young
man
knowing
nothing
as
yet
of
the
childlike
obedience
paid
to
the
king
of
borva
by
his
islanders
thought
to
himself
you
are
a
strong
and
old
gentleman
but
if
i
were
you
i
should
not
meddle
much
with
that
tall
keeper
with
the
eagle
beak
and
the
gray
eyes
i
should
not
like
to
be
a
stag
and
know
that
fellow
was
watching
me
somewhere
with
a
rifle
in
his
at
length
they
came
upon
the
brow
of
the
hill
overlooking
and
the
panorama
of
the
western
lochs
and
mountains
down
there
on
the
side
of
the
hill
was
the
small
inn
with
its
little
patch
of
garden
then
a
few
moist
meadows
leading
over
to
the
estuary
of
the
black
river
and
beyond
that
an
illimitable
prospect
of
heathy
undulations
rising
into
the
mighty
peaks
of
cracabhal
mealasabhal
and
suainabhal
then
on
the
right
leading
away
to
the
as
yet
invisible
atlantic
lay
the
blue
plain
of
loch
roag
with
a
margin
of
yellow
seaweed
along
its
shores
where
the
rocks
revealed
themselves
at
low
water
and
with
a
multitude
of
large
variegated
and
verdant
islands
which
hid
from
sight
the
still
greater
borva
beyond
they
stopped
to
have
a
glass
of
whisky
at
and
mackenzie
got
down
from
the
wagonette
and
went
into
the
inn
this
is
a
highland
loch
said
lavender
turning
to
his
companion
from
the
south
is
an
enchanted
sea
you
could
fancy
yourself
in
the
pacific
if
only
there
were
some
palm
trees
on
the
shores
of
the
islands
no
wonder
you
took
for
an
eve
any
sort
of
woman
you
met
in
such
a
paradise
seem
to
be
thinking
a
good
deal
about
that
young
who
would
not
wish
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
pretty
girl
especially
when
you
have
plenty
of
time
on
your
hands
and
nothing
to
do
but
pay
her
little
attentions
you
know
and
so
forth
as
being
the
daughter
of
your
host
there
was
no
particular
answer
to
such
an
incoherent
question
but
ingram
did
not
seem
so
well
pleased
as
he
had
been
with
the
prospect
of
introducing
his
friend
to
the
young
highland
girl
whose
praises
he
had
been
reciting
for
many
a
day
however
they
drank
their
whisky
drove
on
to
callernish
and
here
paused
for
a
minute
or
two
to
show
the
stranger
a
series
of
large
druidical
stones
which
occupy
a
small
station
overlooking
the
loch
could
anything
have
been
more
impressive
than
the
sight
of
these
solitary
gray
pillars
placed
on
this
bit
of
high
over
the
sea
and
telling
of
a
race
that
vanished
ages
ago
and
left
the
surrounding
plains
and
hills
and
shores
a
wild
and
untenanted
solitude
but
somehow
lavender
did
not
care
to
remain
among
those
voiceless
monuments
of
a
forgotten
past
he
said
he
would
come
and
sketch
them
some
other
day
he
praised
the
picture
all
around
and
then
came
back
to
the
stretch
of
ruffled
blue
water
lying
at
the
base
of
the
hill
was
boat
he
asked
they
left
the
high
plain
with
its
or
stones
of
mourning
and
descended
to
the
side
of
the
loch
in
a
few
moments
duncan
who
had
been
disposing
of
the
horses
and
the
wagonette
overtook
them
got
ready
the
boat
and
presently
they
were
cutting
asunder
the
bright
blue
plain
of
summer
waves
at
last
they
were
nearing
the
king
of
home
and
ingram
began
to
study
the
appearance
of
the
neighboring
shores
as
if
he
would
pick
out
some
feature
of
the
island
he
remembered
the
white
foam
hissed
down
the
side
of
the
open
boat
the
sun
burned
hot
on
the
brown
sail
far
away
over
the
shining
plain
the
salmon
were
leaping
into
the
air
catching
a
quick
glint
of
silver
on
their
scales
before
they
splashed
again
into
the
water
half
a
dozen
with
their
beautiful
black
and
white
plumage
and
scarlet
beaks
and
feet
flew
screaming
out
from
the
rocks
and
swept
in
rapid
circles
above
the
boat
a
long
flight
of
solan
geese
could
just
be
seen
slowly
sailing
along
the
westward
horizon
as
the
small
craft
got
out
toward
the
sea
the
breeze
freshened
slightly
and
she
lay
over
somewhat
as
the
winds
caught
her
and
tingled
on
the
cheeks
of
her
passengers
from
the
softer
south
finally
as
the
great
channel
widened
out
and
the
various
smaller
islands
disappeared
behind
ingram
touched
his
companion
on
the
shoulder
looked
over
to
a
long
and
low
line
of
rock
and
hill
and
said
and
this
was
borva
nothing
visible
but
an
indefinite
extent
of
rocky
shore
with
here
and
there
a
bay
of
white
sand
and
over
that
a
of
green
pasture
apparently
uninhabited
are
not
many
people
on
the
island
said
lavender
who
seemed
rather
disappointed
with
the
look
of
the
place
are
three
hundred
said
mackenzie
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
experienced
the
difficulties
of
ruling
over
three
hundred
islanders
he
had
scarcely
spoken
when
his
attention
was
called
by
duncan
to
some
object
that
the
gillie
had
been
regarding
for
some
minutes
back
it
is
miss
sheila
said
duncan
a
sort
of
flush
of
expectation
passed
over
face
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
ingram
laughed
did
the
foolish
youth
fancy
he
could
see
half
as
far
as
this
man
who
had
now
sunk
into
his
accustomed
seat
by
the
mast
there
was
nothing
visible
to
ordinary
eyes
but
a
speck
of
a
boat
with
a
single
sail
up
which
was
apparently
in
the
distance
running
in
for
borva
ay
ay
said
mackenzie
in
a
vexed
way
is
sheila
true
enough
and
what
will
she
do
out
in
the
boat
at
this
time
when
she
wass
to
be
at
home
to
receive
the
gentlemen
that
hef
come
all
the
way
from
london
mackenzie
said
lavender
should
be
sorry
to
think
that
our
coming
had
interfered
in
any
way
whatever
with
your
said
the
old
man
with
a
look
of
surprise
iss
not
amusements
she
will
go
for
that
is
no
amusements
for
her
it
is
for
some
teffle
of
a
purpose
she
will
go
when
it
iss
the
house
that
is
the
proper
place
for
her
with
friends
coming
from
so
great
a
presently
it
became
clear
that
a
race
between
the
two
boats
was
inevitable
both
of
them
making
for
the
same
point
mackenzie
would
take
no
notice
of
such
a
thing
but
there
was
a
grave
smile
on
face
and
something
like
a
look
of
pride
in
his
keen
eyes
iss
no
one
not
one
he
said
almost
to
himself
take
her
in
better
that
miss
sheila
not
one
in
ta
island
and
it
wass
me
tat
learnt
her
every
bit
ta
steering
about
the
strangers
could
now
make
out
that
in
the
other
boat
there
were
two
girls
one
seated
in
the
stern
the
other
by
the
mast
ingram
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
waved
it
a
similar
token
of
recognition
was
floated
out
from
the
other
vessel
but
boat
presently
had
the
better
of
the
wind
and
slowly
drew
on
ahead
until
when
her
passengers
landed
on
the
rude
stone
quay
they
found
the
other
and
smaller
craft
still
some
little
distance
off
lavender
paid
little
attention
to
his
luggage
he
let
duncan
do
with
it
what
he
liked
he
was
watching
the
small
boat
coming
in
and
getting
a
little
impatient
and
perhaps
a
little
nervous
in
waiting
for
a
glimpse
of
the
young
lady
in
the
stern
he
could
vaguely
make
out
that
she
had
an
abundance
of
dark
hair
looped
up
that
she
wore
a
small
straw
hat
with
a
short
white
feather
in
it
and
that
for
the
rest
she
seemed
to
be
habited
entirely
in
some
rough
and
costume
of
dark
blue
or
was
there
a
glimmer
of
a
band
of
around
her
neck
the
small
boat
was
cleverly
run
alongside
the
jetty
duncan
caught
her
bow
and
held
her
fast
and
miss
sheila
with
a
heavy
string
of
lythe
in
her
right
hand
stepped
laughing
and
blushing
on
to
the
quay
ingram
was
there
she
dropped
the
fish
on
the
stones
and
took
his
two
hands
in
hers
and
without
uttering
a
word
looked
a
glad
welcome
into
his
face
it
was
a
face
capable
of
saying
unwritten
things
fine
and
delicate
in
form
and
yet
full
of
an
abundance
of
health
and
good
spirits
that
shone
in
deep
eyes
first
emotion
was
one
of
surprise
that
he
should
have
heard
this
handsome
and
girl
called
sheila
and
spoken
of
in
a
pretty
and
caressing
way
he
thought
there
was
something
almost
majestic
in
her
figure
in
the
poising
of
her
head
and
the
outline
of
her
face
but
presently
he
began
to
perceive
some
singular
suggestions
of
sensitiveness
and
meekness
in
the
low
sweet
brow
in
the
short
and
exquisitely
curved
upper
lip
and
in
the
look
of
the
tender
blue
eyes
which
had
long
black
eyelashes
to
give
them
a
peculiar
and
indefinable
charm
all
this
he
noticed
hastily
and
timidly
as
he
heard
ingram
who
still
held
the
hands
in
his
saying
sheila
and
you
quite
forgotten
me
and
you
are
grown
such
a
woman
now
why
i
call
you
sheila
any
more
i
think
but
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
friend
who
has
come
all
the
way
from
london
to
see
all
the
wonderful
things
at
if
there
was
any
embarrassment
or
blushing
during
that
simple
ceremony
it
was
not
on
the
side
of
the
highland
girl
for
she
frankly
shook
hands
with
him
and
said
you
very
well
the
second
impression
which
lavender
gathered
from
her
was
that
nowhere
in
the
world
was
english
pronounced
so
beautifully
as
in
the
island
of
lewis
the
gentle
intonation
with
which
she
spoke
was
so
tender
and
touching
the
slight
dwelling
on
the
in
and
seemed
to
have
such
a
sound
of
sincerity
about
it
that
he
could
have
fancied
he
had
been
a
friend
of
hers
for
a
lifetime
and
if
she
said
for
what
then
it
was
the
most
beautiful
english
he
had
ever
heard
the
party
now
moved
off
toward
the
shore
above
the
long
white
curve
of
which
house
was
visible
the
old
man
himself
led
the
way
and
had
by
his
silence
apparently
not
quite
forgiven
his
daughter
for
having
been
absent
from
home
when
his
guests
arrived
sheila
said
ingram
me
all
about
yourself
what
have
you
been
doing
morning
said
the
girl
walking
beside
him
with
her
hand
laid
on
his
arm
and
with
the
happiest
look
on
her
face
morning
to
begin
with
did
you
catch
those
fish
yourself
no
there
was
no
time
for
that
and
it
was
mairi
and
i
saw
a
boat
coming
in
and
it
was
going
to
mevaig
but
we
overtook
it
and
got
some
of
the
fish
and
we
thought
we
should
be
back
before
you
came
however
it
is
no
matter
since
you
are
here
and
you
have
been
very
well
and
did
you
see
any
differences
in
stornoway
when
you
came
over
lavender
began
to
think
that
styornoway
sounded
ever
so
much
more
pleasant
than
mere
stornoway
had
not
a
minute
to
wait
in
stornoway
but
tell
me
sheila
all
about
borva
and
yourself
that
is
better
than
stornoway
how
are
your
schools
getting
on
and
have
you
bribed
or
frightened
all
the
children
into
giving
up
gaelic
yet
how
is
john
the
piper
and
does
the
free
church
minister
still
complain
of
him
and
have
you
caught
any
more
wild
ducks
and
tamed
them
and
are
there
any
gray
geese
up
at
that
is
too
many
at
once
said
sheila
laughing
i
am
afraid
your
friend
will
find
borva
very
lonely
and
dull
there
is
not
much
there
at
all
for
all
the
lads
are
away
at
the
caithness
fishing
and
you
should
have
shown
him
all
about
stornoway
and
taken
him
up
to
the
castle
and
the
beautiful
has
seen
all
sorts
of
castles
sheila
and
all
sorts
of
gardens
in
every
part
of
the
world
he
has
seen
everything
to
be
seen
in
the
great
cities
and
countries
that
are
only
names
to
you
he
has
traveled
in
france
italy
russia
germany
and
seen
all
the
big
towns
that
you
hear
of
in
is
what
i
should
like
to
do
if
i
were
a
man
said
sheila
many
and
many
a
time
i
wished
i
had
been
a
man
that
i
could
go
to
the
fishing
and
work
in
the
fields
and
then
when
i
had
enough
money
go
away
and
see
other
countries
and
strange
if
you
were
a
man
i
should
not
have
come
all
the
way
from
london
to
see
you
said
ingram
patting
the
hand
that
lay
on
his
arm
if
i
were
a
man
said
the
girl
quite
frankly
should
go
up
to
london
to
see
mackenzie
smiled
grimly
and
said
it
is
nonsense
you
will
at
this
moment
sheila
turned
around
and
said
we
have
forgotten
poor
mairi
mairi
why
did
you
not
leave
the
fish
for
duncan
they
are
too
heavy
for
you
i
will
carry
them
to
the
but
lavender
sprang
forward
and
insisted
on
taking
possession
of
the
thick
cord
with
its
considerable
weight
of
lythe
is
my
cousin
mairi
said
sheila
and
forthwith
the
young
girl
shook
hands
with
the
gentlemen
and
said
just
as
if
she
had
been
watching
sheila
are
you
ferry
well
sir
for
the
rest
of
the
way
up
to
the
house
lavender
walked
by
the
side
of
sheila
and
as
the
string
of
lythe
had
formed
the
introduction
to
their
talk
it
ran
pretty
much
upon
natural
history
in
about
five
minutes
she
had
told
him
more
about
and
fish
than
ever
he
knew
in
his
life
and
she
wound
up
this
information
by
offering
to
take
him
out
on
the
following
morning
that
he
might
himself
catch
some
lythe
i
am
a
wretchedly
bad
fisherman
miss
mackenzie
he
said
is
some
years
since
i
tried
to
throw
a
there
is
no
need
for
good
fishing
when
you
catch
lythe
she
said
earnestly
will
see
ingram
catch
them
it
is
only
a
big
white
fly
you
will
need
and
a
long
line
and
when
the
fish
takes
the
fly
down
he
goes
a
great
depth
then
when
you
have
got
him
and
he
is
killed
you
must
cut
the
sides
as
you
see
that
is
done
and
string
him
to
a
rope
and
trail
him
behind
the
boat
all
the
way
home
if
you
do
not
do
that
it
is
no
use
at
all
to
eat
but
if
you
like
the
my
papa
will
teach
you
that
there
is
no
one
she
added
proudly
catch
salmon
like
my
papa
not
even
duncan
and
the
gentlemen
who
come
in
the
autumn
to
stornoway
they
are
quite
surprised
when
my
papa
goes
to
fish
with
suppose
he
is
a
good
shot
too
said
the
young
man
amused
to
notice
the
proud
way
in
which
the
girl
spoke
of
her
father
he
can
shoot
anything
he
will
shoot
a
seal
if
he
comes
up
but
for
one
moment
above
the
water
and
all
the
birds
he
will
get
you
all
the
birds
if
you
will
wish
to
take
any
away
with
you
we
have
no
deer
on
the
island
it
is
too
small
for
that
but
in
the
lewis
and
in
harris
there
are
many
many
thousands
of
deer
and
my
papa
has
many
invitations
when
the
gentlemen
come
up
in
the
autumn
and
if
you
look
in
the
of
the
lodges
you
will
see
there
is
not
any
one
who
has
shot
so
many
deer
as
my
papa
not
any
one
at
length
they
reached
the
building
of
dark
and
rude
with
its
red
coping
its
spacious
porch
and
its
small
enclosure
of
garden
in
front
lavender
praised
the
flowers
in
this
enclosure
he
guessed
they
were
particular
care
but
in
truth
there
was
nothing
rare
or
delicate
among
the
plants
growing
in
this
exposed
situation
there
were
a
few
clusters
of
large
yellow
pansies
a
calceolaria
or
two
plenty
of
wallflower
some
and
an
abundance
of
in
all
manner
of
colors
but
the
chief
beauty
of
the
small
garden
was
a
magnificent
which
grew
in
front
of
one
of
the
windows
and
was
covered
with
deep
flowers
set
amid
its
small
and
leaves
for
the
rest
a
bit
of
honeysuckle
was
turned
up
one
side
of
the
porch
and
at
the
small
wooden
gate
there
were
two
bushes
of
sweetbrier
that
filled
the
warm
air
with
fragrance
just
before
entering
the
house
the
two
strangers
turned
to
have
a
look
at
the
spacious
landscape
lying
all
around
in
the
perfect
calm
of
a
summer
day
and
lo
before
them
there
was
but
a
blinding
mass
of
white
that
glared
upon
their
eyes
and
caused
them
to
see
the
far
sea
and
the
shores
and
hills
as
but
faint
shadows
appearing
through
a
silvery
haze
a
thin
fleece
of
cloud
lay
across
the
sun
but
the
light
was
nevertheless
so
intense
that
the
objects
near
at
hand
a
disused
boat
lying
bottom
upward
an
immense
anchor
of
foreign
make
and
some
such
things
seemed
to
be
as
black
as
night
as
they
lay
on
the
warm
road
but
when
the
eye
got
beyond
the
house
and
the
garden
and
the
rough
hillside
leading
down
to
loch
roag
all
the
world
appeared
to
be
a
blaze
of
calm
silent
and
luminous
heat
suainabhal
and
its
brother
mountains
were
only
as
clouds
in
the
south
along
the
western
horizon
the
portion
of
the
atlantic
that
could
be
seen
lay
like
a
silent
lake
under
a
white
sky
to
get
any
touch
of
color
they
had
to
turn
eastward
and
there
the
sunlight
faintly
fell
on
the
green
shores
of
borva
on
the
narrows
of
loch
roag
and
the
loose
red
sail
of
a
solitary
smack
that
was
slowly
coming
round
a
headland
they
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
long
oars
a
pale
line
of
shadow
lay
in
the
wake
of
the
boat
but
otherwise
the
black
hull
and
the
red
sail
seemed
to
be
coming
through
a
plain
of
molten
silver
when
the
young
men
turned
to
go
into
the
house
the
hall
seemed
a
cavern
of
impenetrable
darkness
and
there
was
a
flush
of
crimson
light
dancing
before
their
eyes
when
ingram
had
his
room
pointed
out
lavender
followed
him
into
it
and
shut
the
door
jove
ingram
he
said
with
a
singular
light
of
enthusiasm
on
his
handsome
face
a
beautiful
voice
that
girl
has
i
have
never
heard
anything
so
soft
and
musical
in
all
my
life
and
then
when
she
smiles
what
perfect
teeth
she
has
and
then
you
know
there
is
an
appearance
a
style
a
grace
about
her
figure
but
i
say
do
you
seriously
mean
to
tell
me
you
are
not
in
love
with
her
course
i
am
not
said
the
other
impatiently
as
he
was
busily
engaged
with
his
portmanteau
let
me
give
you
a
word
of
information
said
the
young
man
with
an
air
of
profound
shrewdness
is
in
love
with
ingram
rose
with
some
little
touch
of
vexation
on
his
face
here
lavender
i
am
going
to
talk
to
you
seriously
i
wish
you
fancy
that
every
one
is
in
that
condition
of
simmering
you
delight
in
you
never
were
in
love
i
believe
i
doubt
whether
you
ever
will
be
but
you
are
always
fancying
yourself
in
love
and
writing
very
pretty
verses
about
it
and
painting
very
pretty
heads
i
like
the
verses
and
the
paintings
well
enough
however
they
are
come
by
but
mislead
yourself
into
believing
that
you
know
anything
whatever
of
a
real
or
serious
passion
by
having
engaged
in
all
sorts
of
imaginative
and
dreams
it
is
a
much
more
serious
thing
than
that
mind
you
when
it
comes
to
a
man
and
for
sake
attribute
any
of
that
sort
of
sentimental
to
either
sheila
mackenzie
or
myself
we
are
not
romantic
folks
we
have
no
imaginative
gifts
whatever
but
we
are
very
glad
you
know
to
be
attentive
and
grateful
to
those
who
have
the
fact
is
i
think
it
quite
fair
us
suppose
i
am
lectured
enough
said
the
other
somewhat
stiffly
suppose
i
am
as
good
a
judge
of
the
character
of
women
as
most
other
men
although
i
am
no
great
student
and
have
no
hard
and
dried
rules
of
philosophy
at
my
ends
perhaps
however
one
may
learn
more
by
mixing
with
other
people
and
going
out
into
the
world
than
by
sitting
in
a
room
with
a
dozen
of
books
and
persuading
self
that
men
and
women
are
to
be
studied
in
that
away
you
stupid
boy
and
unpack
your
portmanteau
and
quarrel
with
me
said
ingram
putting
out
on
the
table
some
things
he
had
brought
for
sheila
if
you
are
friendly
with
sheila
and
treat
her
like
a
human
being
instead
of
trying
to
put
a
lot
of
romance
and
sentiment
about
her
she
will
teach
you
more
than
you
could
learn
in
a
hundred
in
a
thousand
chapter
iii
there
was
a
king
in
thule
he
never
took
that
advice
he
had
already
transformed
sheila
into
a
heroine
during
the
half
hour
of
their
stroll
from
the
beach
and
around
the
house
not
that
he
fell
in
love
with
her
at
first
sight
or
anything
even
approaching
to
that
he
merely
made
her
the
central
figure
of
a
little
speculative
romance
as
he
had
made
many
another
woman
before
of
course
in
these
little
fanciful
dramas
written
along
the
as
it
were
of
his
life
he
invariably
pictured
himself
as
the
fitting
companion
of
the
fair
creatures
he
saw
there
who
but
himself
could
understand
the
sentiment
of
her
eyes
and
teach
her
little
and
express
unbounded
admiration
of
her
more
than
one
practical
young
woman
indeed
in
certain
circles
of
london
society
had
been
informed
by
her
friends
that
mr
lavender
was
dreadfully
in
love
with
her
and
had
been
much
surprised
after
this
confirmation
of
her
suspicions
that
he
sought
no
means
of
bringing
the
affair
to
a
reasonable
and
sensible
issue
he
did
not
even
amuse
himself
by
flirting
with
her
as
men
would
willingly
do
who
could
not
be
charged
with
any
serious
purpose
whatever
his
devotion
was
more
mysterious
and
remote
a
rumor
would
get
about
that
mr
lavender
had
finished
another
of
those
charming
heads
in
pastel
which
at
a
distance
reminded
one
of
greuze
and
that
lady
who
had
bought
it
forthwith
had
declared
that
it
was
the
image
of
this
young
lady
who
was
partly
puzzled
and
partly
vexed
by
the
incomprehensible
conduct
of
her
reputed
admirer
it
was
the
fashion
in
these
social
circles
to
buy
those
heads
of
lavender
when
he
chose
to
paint
them
he
had
achieved
a
great
reputation
by
them
the
good
people
liked
to
have
genius
in
their
own
set
whom
they
had
discovered
and
who
was
only
to
be
appreciated
by
persons
of
exceptional
taste
and
penetration
lavender
the
uninitiated
were
assured
was
a
most
brilliant
and
cultivated
young
man
he
had
composed
some
charming
songs
he
had
written
from
time
to
time
some
quite
delightful
little
poems
over
which
fair
eyes
had
grown
full
and
liquid
who
had
not
heard
of
the
face
that
he
painted
for
a
certain
young
lady
whom
every
one
expected
him
to
marry
the
young
man
escaped
a
great
deal
of
the
ordinary
consequences
of
this
petting
but
not
all
he
was
at
bottom
really
frank
and
generous
generous
even
to
an
extreme
but
he
had
a
habit
of
producing
striking
impressions
which
dogged
and
perverted
his
every
action
and
speech
he
disliked
losing
a
few
shillings
at
billiards
but
he
did
not
mind
losing
a
few
pounds
the
latter
was
good
for
a
story
had
he
possessed
any
money
to
invest
in
shares
he
would
have
been
irritated
by
small
rises
or
small
falls
but
he
would
have
been
vain
of
a
big
rise
and
he
would
have
regarded
a
big
fall
with
equanimity
as
placing
him
in
a
dramatic
light
the
exaggerations
produced
by
this
habit
of
his
fostered
strange
delusions
in
the
minds
of
people
who
did
not
know
him
very
well
and
sometimes
the
practical
results
in
the
way
of
expected
charities
or
what
not
amazed
him
he
could
not
understand
why
people
should
have
made
such
mistakes
and
resented
them
as
an
injustice
and
as
they
sat
at
dinner
on
this
still
brilliant
evening
in
summer
it
was
turn
to
be
clothed
in
the
garments
of
romance
her
father
with
his
great
gray
beard
and
heavy
brow
became
the
king
of
thule
living
in
this
solitary
house
overlooking
the
sea
and
having
memories
of
a
dead
sweetheart
his
daughter
the
princess
had
the
glamor
of
a
thousand
legends
dwelling
in
her
beautiful
eyes
and
when
she
walked
by
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
that
were
now
getting
yellow
under
the
sunset
what
strange
and
unutterable
thoughts
must
appear
in
the
wonder
of
her
face
he
remembered
no
more
how
he
had
pulled
to
pieces
praises
of
sheila
what
had
become
of
the
young
lady
who
would
be
a
little
interesting
if
a
little
stupid
before
marriage
and
after
marriage
sink
into
the
dull
domestic
hind
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
sheila
often
sat
silent
for
a
considerable
time
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
face
when
he
spoke
or
turning
to
look
at
some
other
speaker
had
lavender
now
been
asked
if
this
silence
had
not
a
trifle
of
dullness
in
it
he
would
have
replied
by
asking
if
there
were
dullness
in
the
stillness
and
the
silence
of
the
sea
he
grew
to
regard
her
calm
and
thoughtful
look
as
a
sort
of
spell
and
if
you
had
asked
him
what
sheila
was
like
he
would
have
answered
by
saying
that
there
was
moonlight
in
her
face
the
room
too
in
which
this
mystic
princess
sat
was
strange
and
wonderful
there
were
no
doors
visible
for
the
four
walls
were
throughout
covered
by
paper
of
foreign
manufacture
representing
spacious
tyrolese
landscapes
and
incidents
of
the
chase
when
lavender
had
first
entered
this
chamber
his
eye
had
been
shocked
by
these
coarse
and
prominent
pictures
by
the
green
rivers
the
blue
lakes
and
the
that
rose
above
certain
ruddy
chalets
here
a
chamois
was
stumbling
down
a
ravine
and
there
an
operatic
peasant
some
eight
or
ten
inches
in
actual
length
was
pointing
a
gun
the
large
figures
the
coarse
colors
the
impossible
scenes
all
this
looked
at
first
sight
to
be
in
the
worst
possible
taste
and
lavender
was
convinced
that
sheila
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
introduction
of
this
abominable
decoration
but
somehow
when
he
turned
to
the
line
of
ocean
that
was
visible
from
the
window
to
the
lonely
shores
of
the
island
and
the
monotony
of
colors
showing
in
the
still
picture
without
he
began
to
fancy
that
there
might
be
a
craving
up
in
these
latitudes
for
some
presentation
however
rude
and
glaring
of
the
richer
and
more
variegated
life
of
the
south
the
figures
and
mountains
on
the
walls
became
less
prominent
he
saw
no
incongruity
in
a
whole
chalet
giving
way
and
allowing
duncan
who
waited
at
table
to
bring
from
this
aperture
to
the
kitchen
a
steaming
dish
of
salmon
while
he
spoke
some
words
in
gaelic
to
the
servants
at
the
other
end
of
the
tube
he
even
forgot
to
be
surprised
at
the
appearance
of
little
mairi
with
whom
he
had
shaken
hands
a
little
while
before
coming
round
the
table
with
potatoes
he
did
not
as
a
rule
shake
hands
with
but
was
not
this
girl
some
relative
friend
or
companion
of
and
had
he
not
already
begun
to
lose
all
perception
of
the
incongruous
or
the
absurd
in
the
strange
pervading
charm
with
which
presence
filled
the
place
he
suddenly
found
eyes
fixed
upon
him
and
became
aware
that
the
old
man
had
been
mysteriously
announcing
to
ingram
that
there
were
more
political
movements
abroad
than
people
fancied
sheila
sat
still
and
listened
to
her
father
as
he
expounded
these
things
and
showed
that
although
at
a
distance
he
could
perceive
the
signs
of
the
times
was
it
not
incumbent
moreover
on
a
man
who
had
to
look
after
a
number
of
poor
people
and
simple
folks
that
he
should
be
on
the
alert
iss
not
bekass
you
will
live
in
london
you
will
know
everything
said
the
king
of
borva
with
a
certain
significance
in
his
tone
iss
many
things
a
man
does
not
see
at
his
feet
that
another
man
will
see
who
is
a
good
way
off
the
international
now
he
glanced
furtively
at
lavender
i
hef
been
told
there
will
be
agents
going
out
every
day
to
all
parts
of
this
country
and
other
countries
and
they
will
hef
plenty
of
money
to
live
like
gentlemen
and
get
among
the
poor
people
and
fill
their
minds
with
foolish
nonsense
about
a
revolution
oh
yes
i
hear
about
it
all
and
there
iss
many
members
of
parliament
in
it
and
it
is
every
day
they
will
get
farther
and
farther
all
working
hard
though
no
one
sees
them
who
does
not
understand
to
be
on
the
here
again
the
young
man
received
a
quiet
scrutinizing
glance
and
it
began
to
dawn
upon
him
to
his
infinite
astonishment
that
mackenzie
half
suspected
him
of
being
an
emissary
of
the
international
in
the
case
of
any
other
man
he
would
have
laughed
and
paid
no
heed
but
how
could
he
permit
father
to
regard
him
with
any
such
suspicion
you
think
sir
he
said
boldly
those
internationalists
are
a
lot
of
incorrigible
idiots
as
if
a
shrewd
observer
of
men
and
motives
were
to
be
deceived
by
such
a
protest
mackenzie
regarded
him
with
increased
suspicion
although
he
endeavored
to
conceal
the
fact
that
he
was
watching
the
young
man
from
time
to
time
lavender
saw
all
the
favor
he
had
won
during
the
day
disappearing
and
moodily
wondered
when
he
should
have
a
chance
of
explanation
after
dinner
they
went
outside
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
in
the
garden
and
the
men
lit
their
cigars
it
was
a
cool
and
pleasant
evening
the
sun
had
gone
down
in
the
red
fire
behind
the
atlantic
and
there
was
still
left
a
rich
glow
of
crimson
in
the
west
while
overhead
in
the
pale
yellow
of
the
sky
some
filmy
clouds
of
lay
motionless
how
calm
was
the
sea
out
there
and
the
whiter
stretch
of
water
coming
into
loch
roag
the
cool
air
of
the
twilight
was
scented
with
sweetbrier
the
wash
of
the
ripples
along
the
coast
could
be
heard
in
the
stillness
it
was
a
time
for
lovers
to
sit
by
the
sea
careless
of
the
future
or
the
past
but
why
would
this
old
man
keep
prating
of
his
political
prophecies
lavender
asked
of
himself
sheila
had
spoken
scarcely
a
word
all
the
evening
and
of
what
interest
could
it
be
to
her
to
listen
to
theories
of
revolution
and
the
dangers
besetting
our
youth
she
merely
stood
by
the
side
of
her
father
with
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
noticed
however
that
she
paid
particular
attention
whenever
ingram
spoke
and
he
wondered
whether
she
perceived
that
ingram
was
partly
humoring
the
old
man
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
pleasing
himself
with
a
series
of
monologues
interrupted
only
by
his
cigar
is
true
enough
mackenzie
ingram
would
say
laying
back
with
his
two
hands
clasped
around
his
knee
as
usual
got
to
be
careful
of
the
opinions
that
are
spread
abroad
even
in
borva
where
not
much
danger
is
to
be
expected
but
i
suppose
our
young
men
are
more
destructive
in
their
notions
than
young
men
always
have
been
you
know
every
fellow
starts
in
life
by
knocking
down
all
the
beliefs
he
finds
before
him
and
then
spends
the
rest
of
his
life
in
setting
them
up
again
it
is
only
after
some
years
he
gets
to
know
that
all
the
wisdom
of
the
world
lies
in
the
old
commonplaces
he
once
despised
he
finds
that
the
old
familiar
ways
are
the
best
and
he
sinks
into
being
a
commonplace
person
with
much
satisfaction
to
himself
my
friend
lavender
now
is
continually
charging
me
with
being
commonplace
i
admit
the
charge
i
have
drifted
back
into
all
the
old
ways
and
beliefs
about
religion
and
marriage
and
patriotism
and
what
not
that
ten
years
ago
i
should
have
treated
with
the
process
continues
suggested
lavender
with
some
evidence
of
pique
it
does
continues
ingram
carelessly
years
hence
i
may
be
proud
to
become
a
vestryman
and
have
the
most
anxious
care
about
the
administration
of
the
rates
i
shall
be
looking
after
the
drainage
of
houses
and
the
treatment
of
paupers
and
the
management
of
but
all
this
is
an
invasion
of
your
province
sheila
he
suddenly
added
looking
up
to
her
the
girl
laughed
and
said
i
have
been
commonplace
from
the
beginning
ingram
was
about
to
make
all
manner
of
protests
and
apologies
when
mackenzie
said
it
wass
time
you
go
if
you
have
nothing
about
your
head
go
in
and
sing
a
song
to
us
and
we
will
listen
to
you
and
not
a
sad
song
but
a
good
merry
song
these
teffles
of
the
fishermen
it
iss
always
drownings
they
will
sing
about
from
the
morning
till
the
was
sheila
about
to
sing
in
this
clear
strange
twilight
while
they
sat
there
and
watched
the
yellow
moon
come
up
behind
the
southern
hills
lavender
had
heard
so
much
of
her
singing
of
these
ballads
that
he
could
think
of
nothing
more
to
add
to
the
enchantment
of
this
wonderful
night
but
he
was
disappointed
the
girl
put
her
hand
on
her
head
and
reminded
him
that
she
had
had
her
big
greyhound
bras
imprisoned
all
the
afternoon
that
she
had
to
go
down
to
borvapost
with
a
message
for
some
people
who
were
leaving
by
the
boat
in
the
morning
and
would
the
gentleman
therefore
excuse
her
not
singing
to
them
for
this
one
evening
you
can
not
go
away
down
to
borvapost
by
yourself
sheila
said
ingram
will
be
dark
before
you
will
not
be
darker
than
this
all
the
night
through
said
the
girl
i
hope
you
will
let
us
go
with
you
said
lavender
rather
anxiously
and
she
assented
with
a
gracious
smile
and
went
to
fetch
the
great
deerhound
that
was
her
constant
companion
and
lo
he
found
himself
walking
with
a
princess
in
the
wonderland
through
that
magic
twilight
that
prevails
in
northern
latitudes
mackenzie
and
ingram
had
gone
on
in
front
the
large
deerhound
after
regarding
him
attentively
had
gone
to
his
side
and
remained
closely
there
lavender
could
scarcely
believe
his
ears
that
the
girl
was
talking
to
him
lightly
and
frankly
as
though
she
had
known
him
for
years
and
was
telling
him
of
all
her
troubles
with
the
folks
at
the
borvapost
and
of
those
poor
people
whom
she
was
now
going
to
see
no
sooner
did
he
understand
that
they
were
emigrants
and
that
they
were
going
to
glasgow
before
leaving
finally
for
america
than
in
quite
an
honest
and
enthusiastic
fashion
he
began
to
bewail
the
sad
fate
of
such
poor
wretches
as
have
to
forsake
their
native
land
and
to
accuse
the
aristocracy
of
the
country
of
every
act
of
selfishness
and
to
charge
the
government
of
shameful
indifference
but
sheila
brought
him
up
suddenly
in
the
gentlest
fashion
she
told
him
that
she
knew
of
these
poor
people
and
how
emigration
affected
them
and
so
forth
until
he
was
ready
to
curse
the
hour
in
which
he
had
blundered
into
taking
a
side
on
a
question
about
which
he
cared
nothing
and
knew
less
some
other
time
continued
sheila
will
tell
you
what
we
do
here
and
i
will
show
you
a
great
many
letters
i
have
from
friends
of
mine
who
have
gone
to
greenock
and
to
new
york
and
canada
oh
yes
it
is
very
bad
for
the
old
people
they
never
get
reconciled
to
the
change
never
but
it
is
very
good
for
the
young
people
and
they
are
glad
of
it
and
are
much
better
off
than
they
were
here
you
will
see
how
proud
they
are
of
the
better
clothes
they
have
and
of
good
food
and
of
money
to
put
in
the
bank
and
how
could
they
get
that
in
the
highlands
where
the
land
is
so
poor
that
a
small
piece
is
no
use
and
they
have
not
money
to
rent
the
large
sheep
farms
it
is
very
bad
to
have
people
go
away
it
is
very
hard
on
many
of
them
but
what
can
they
do
the
piece
of
ground
that
was
very
good
for
the
one
family
that
is
expected
to
keep
the
daughters
when
they
marry
and
the
sons
when
they
marry
and
then
there
are
five
or
six
families
to
live
on
it
and
hard
work
that
will
not
do
much
with
very
bad
land
and
the
bad
weather
we
have
here
the
people
get
downhearted
when
they
have
their
crops
spoiled
by
the
long
rain
and
they
can
not
get
their
peats
dried
and
very
often
the
fishing
turns
out
bad
and
they
have
no
money
at
all
to
carry
on
the
farm
but
now
you
will
see
lavender
had
to
confess
that
this
wonderful
princess
would
persist
in
talking
in
a
very
way
all
the
afternoon
while
he
was
weaving
a
luminous
web
of
imagination
around
her
she
was
continually
cutting
it
asunder
and
stepping
forth
as
an
authority
on
the
growing
of
some
wretched
plants
or
the
means
by
which
rain
was
to
be
excluded
from
and
now
in
this
strange
twilight
when
she
ought
to
have
been
singing
of
the
cruelties
of
the
sea
or
listening
to
legends
of
mermaids
she
was
engaged
with
the
petty
fortunes
of
men
and
girls
who
were
pleased
to
find
themselves
prospering
in
the
glasgow
police
force
or
educating
themselves
in
a
shop
in
edinburgh
she
did
not
appear
conscious
that
she
was
a
princess
indeed
she
seemed
to
have
no
consciousness
of
herself
at
all
and
was
altogether
occupied
in
giving
him
information
about
practical
subjects
in
which
he
professed
a
profound
interest
he
certainly
did
not
feel
but
even
sheila
when
they
had
reached
the
loftiest
part
of
their
route
and
could
see
beneath
them
the
island
and
the
water
surrounding
it
was
struck
by
the
exceeding
beauty
of
the
twilight
and
as
for
her
companion
he
remembered
it
many
a
time
thereafter
as
if
it
were
a
dream
of
the
sea
before
them
lay
the
atlantic
a
pale
line
of
blue
still
silent
and
remote
overhead
the
sky
was
of
a
clear
pale
gold
with
heavy
masses
of
violet
cloud
stretched
across
from
north
to
south
and
thickening
as
they
got
near
to
the
horizon
down
at
their
feet
near
the
shore
a
dusky
line
of
huts
and
houses
was
scarcely
visible
and
over
these
lay
a
pale
blue
film
of
that
did
not
move
in
the
still
air
then
they
saw
the
bay
into
which
the
white
water
runs
and
they
could
trace
the
yellow
glimmer
of
the
river
stretching
into
the
island
through
a
level
valley
of
bog
and
morass
far
away
toward
the
east
lay
the
bulk
of
the
island
dark
green
undulations
of
moorland
and
pasture
and
there
in
the
darkness
the
gable
of
one
white
house
had
caught
the
clear
light
of
the
sky
and
was
gleaming
westward
like
a
star
but
all
this
was
as
nothing
to
the
glory
that
began
to
shine
in
the
southeast
where
the
sky
was
of
a
pale
violet
over
the
peaks
of
melasabhal
and
suainabhal
there
into
the
beautiful
dome
rose
the
golden
crescent
of
the
moon
warm
in
color
as
though
it
still
retained
the
last
rays
of
the
sunset
a
line
of
quivering
gold
fell
across
loch
roag
and
touched
the
black
hull
and
spars
of
the
boat
in
which
sheila
had
been
sailing
in
the
morning
that
bay
down
there
with
its
white
sands
and
massive
rocks
its
still
expanse
of
water
and
its
background
of
mountain
peaks
palely
colored
by
the
yellow
moonlight
seemed
really
a
home
for
a
magic
princess
who
was
shut
off
from
all
the
world
but
here
in
front
of
them
was
another
sort
of
sea
and
another
sort
of
life
a
small
fishing
village
hidden
under
a
cloud
of
pale
and
fronting
the
great
waters
of
the
atlantic
itself
which
lay
under
a
gloom
of
violet
clouds
said
sheila
with
a
smile
have
not
always
weather
as
good
as
this
in
the
island
will
you
not
sit
on
the
bench
over
there
with
ingram
and
wait
until
my
papa
and
i
come
up
from
the
village
again
not
i
go
down
with
you
the
dogs
would
learn
you
were
a
stranger
and
there
would
be
a
great
deal
of
noise
and
there
will
be
many
of
the
poor
people
so
sheila
had
her
way
and
she
and
her
father
went
down
the
hillside
into
the
gloom
of
the
village
while
lavender
went
to
join
his
friend
ingram
who
was
sitting
on
the
wooden
bench
silently
smoking
a
clay
pipe
i
have
never
seen
the
like
of
this
said
lavender
in
his
impetuous
way
is
worth
going
a
thousand
miles
to
see
such
colors
and
such
clearness
and
then
the
splendid
outlines
of
those
mountains
and
the
grand
sweep
of
this
loch
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
drives
me
to
despair
and
might
make
one
vow
never
to
touch
a
brush
again
and
sheila
says
it
will
be
like
this
all
the
night
he
was
unaware
that
he
had
spoken
of
her
in
a
very
familiar
way
but
ingram
noticed
it
he
said
suddenly
is
the
first
girl
i
have
ever
seen
whom
i
should
like
to
it
is
true
i
have
never
seen
any
one
like
her
so
handsome
so
gentle
and
yet
so
very
frank
in
setting
you
right
and
then
she
is
so
sensible
you
know
and
not
too
proud
to
have
much
interest
in
all
sorts
of
common
affairs
there
was
a
smile
in
face
and
his
companion
stopped
in
some
vexation
are
not
a
very
sympathetic
i
know
the
story
of
old
you
have
told
it
me
about
twenty
women
and
it
is
always
the
same
i
tell
you
you
know
anything
at
all
about
sheila
mackenzie
yet
perhaps
you
never
may
i
suppose
you
will
make
a
heroine
of
her
and
will
fall
in
love
with
her
for
a
fortnight
and
then
go
back
to
london
and
get
cured
by
listening
to
the
witticisms
of
you
very
i
mean
to
offend
you
some
day
no
doubt
you
will
love
a
woman
for
what
she
is
not
for
what
you
fancy
her
to
be
but
that
is
a
piece
of
good
fortune
that
seldom
occurs
to
a
youth
of
your
age
to
marry
in
a
dream
and
wake
up
six
months
afterwards
that
is
the
fate
of
ingenuous
but
you
let
mackenzie
hear
you
talk
of
marrying
sheila
or
have
some
of
his
fishermen
throw
you
into
loch
now
that
one
point
i
understand
about
her
said
lavender
eagerly
can
a
girl
of
her
shrewdness
and
good
sense
have
such
a
belief
in
that
humbugging
old
idiot
of
a
father
of
hers
who
fancies
me
a
political
emissary
and
plays
small
tricks
to
look
like
diplomacy
it
is
always
papa
can
do
this
and
papa
can
do
that
and
is
no
one
at
all
like
my
and
she
is
continually
fondling
him
and
giving
little
demonstrations
of
affection
of
which
he
takes
no
more
notice
than
if
he
were
an
arctic
ingram
looked
up
with
some
surprise
in
his
face
mean
to
say
lavender
he
said
slowly
you
are
already
jealous
of
the
own
father
he
could
not
answer
for
at
this
moment
sheila
her
father
and
the
big
greyhound
came
up
the
hill
and
again
it
was
good
fortune
to
walk
with
sheila
across
the
moorland
path
they
had
traversed
some
little
time
before
and
now
the
moon
was
still
higher
in
the
heavens
and
the
yellow
lane
of
light
that
crossed
the
violet
waters
of
loch
roag
quivered
in
a
deeper
gold
the
night
air
was
scented
with
the
dutch
clover
growing
down
by
the
shore
they
could
hear
the
curlew
whistling
and
the
plover
calling
amid
that
monotonous
plash
of
the
waves
that
murmured
all
around
the
coast
when
they
returned
to
the
house
the
darker
waters
of
the
atlantic
and
the
purple
clouds
of
the
west
were
shut
out
of
sight
and
before
them
there
was
only
the
liquid
plain
of
loch
roag
with
its
pathway
of
yellow
fire
and
far
away
on
the
other
side
the
shoulders
and
peaks
of
the
southern
mountains
that
had
grown
gray
and
clear
and
sharp
in
the
beautiful
twilight
and
this
was
home
part
ii
chapter
iv
early
morning
at
borva
fresh
luminous
and
rare
the
mountains
in
the
south
grown
pale
and
under
a
sapphire
sky
the
sea
ruffled
into
a
darker
blue
by
a
light
breeze
from
the
west
and
the
sunlight
lying
hot
on
the
red
gravel
and
white
shells
around
house
there
is
an
odor
of
sweetbrier
about
hovering
in
the
warm
still
air
except
at
such
times
as
the
breeze
freshens
a
bit
and
brings
around
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
the
cold
strange
scent
of
the
rocks
and
the
sea
beyond
and
on
this
fresh
and
pleasant
morning
sheila
sat
in
the
big
in
front
of
the
house
talking
to
the
stranger
to
whom
she
had
been
introduced
the
day
before
he
was
no
more
a
stranger
however
to
all
appearance
for
what
could
be
more
frank
and
friendly
than
their
conversation
or
more
bright
and
winning
than
the
smile
with
which
she
frequently
turned
to
speak
or
to
listen
of
course
this
stranger
could
not
be
her
friend
as
ingram
was
that
was
impossible
but
he
talked
a
great
deal
more
than
ingram
and
was
apparently
more
anxious
to
please
and
be
pleased
and
indeed
was
altogether
very
winning
and
courteous
and
pleasant
in
his
ways
beyond
this
vague
impression
sheila
ventured
upon
no
further
comparison
between
the
two
men
if
her
older
friend
had
been
down
she
would
doubtless
have
preferred
talking
to
him
about
all
that
had
happened
in
the
island
since
his
last
visit
but
here
was
this
newer
friend
thrown
as
it
were
upon
her
hospitality
and
eager
with
a
most
respectful
and
yet
simple
and
friendly
interest
to
be
taught
all
that
ingram
already
knew
was
he
not
too
in
mere
appearance
like
one
of
the
princes
she
had
read
of
in
many
an
ancient
ballad
tall
and
handsome
and
fit
to
have
come
sailing
over
the
sea
with
a
dozen
merry
comrades
to
carry
off
some
daughter
to
be
his
bride
sheila
began
to
regret
that
the
young
man
knew
so
little
about
the
sea
and
the
northern
islands
and
those
stories
but
then
he
was
very
anxious
to
learn
must
say
instead
of
macleod
she
was
saying
to
him
you
like
better
than
stornoway
it
is
the
gaelic
that
is
it
is
ever
so
much
prettier
said
young
lavender
with
a
quite
genuine
enthusiasm
in
his
face
not
altogether
begotten
of
the
letter
indeed
i
think
you
can
possibly
tell
how
singularly
pleasant
and
quaint
it
is
to
an
english
ear
to
hear
just
that
little
softening
of
the
vowels
that
the
people
have
here
i
suppose
you
notice
that
they
say
for
garden
as
if
he
had
paid
attention
to
the
pronunciation
of
any
one
except
sheila
herself
not
quite
so
hard
as
i
pronounce
it
and
so
with
a
great
many
other
words
that
are
softened
and
sweetened
and
made
almost
poetical
in
their
sound
by
the
least
bit
of
inflection
how
surprised
and
pleased
english
ladies
would
be
to
hear
you
speak
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
not
mean
to
i
i
beg
your
pardon
sheila
seemed
a
little
astonished
by
her
evident
mortification
and
said
with
a
smile
others
speak
so
in
the
island
of
course
i
must
too
and
you
say
it
does
not
shock
his
distress
at
his
own
rudeness
now
found
an
easy
vent
he
protested
that
no
people
could
talk
english
like
the
people
of
lewis
he
gave
sheila
to
understand
that
the
speech
of
english
folks
was
as
the
croaking
of
ravens
compared
with
the
sweet
tones
of
the
northern
isles
and
this
drew
him
on
to
speak
of
his
friends
in
the
south
and
of
london
and
the
chances
of
sheila
ever
going
thither
must
be
so
strange
never
to
have
seen
london
he
said
you
ever
dream
of
what
it
is
like
you
ever
try
to
think
of
a
great
space
nearly
as
big
as
this
island
all
covered
over
with
large
houses
the
roads
between
the
houses
all
made
of
stone
and
great
bridges
going
over
the
rivers
with
railway
trains
standing
by
the
way
you
have
never
seen
a
railway
engine
he
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
in
astonishment
as
if
he
had
not
hitherto
realized
to
himself
the
absolute
ignorance
of
the
remote
princess
sheila
with
some
little
touch
of
humor
appearing
in
her
calm
eyes
said
i
am
not
quite
ignorant
of
all
these
things
i
have
seen
pictures
of
them
and
my
papa
has
described
them
so
often
that
i
will
feel
as
if
i
had
seen
them
all
and
i
do
not
think
that
i
should
be
surprised
except
perhaps
by
the
noise
of
the
big
towns
it
was
many
a
time
my
papa
told
me
of
that
but
he
says
i
can
not
understand
it
nor
the
great
distance
of
land
you
travel
over
to
get
to
london
that
is
what
i
do
not
wish
to
see
i
was
often
thinking
of
it
and
that
to
pass
so
many
places
that
you
do
not
know
would
make
you
very
can
be
easily
avoided
he
said
lightly
you
go
to
london
you
must
go
from
glasgow
or
edinburgh
in
a
night
train
and
fall
fast
asleep
and
in
the
morning
you
will
find
yourself
in
london
without
having
seen
as
if
one
had
gone
across
a
great
distance
of
sea
and
come
to
another
island
you
will
never
see
before
said
sheila
with
the
eyes
under
the
black
eyelashes
grown
strange
and
distant
you
must
not
think
of
it
as
a
melancholy
thing
he
said
almost
anxiously
will
find
yourself
among
all
sorts
of
gaities
and
amusements
you
will
have
cheerful
people
around
you
and
plenty
of
things
to
see
you
will
drive
in
beautiful
parks
and
go
to
theatres
and
meet
people
in
large
and
brilliant
rooms
filled
with
flowers
and
silver
and
light
and
all
through
the
winter
that
must
be
so
cold
and
dark
up
here
you
will
find
an
abundance
of
warmth
and
light
and
plenty
of
flowers
and
every
sort
of
pleasant
thing
you
will
hear
no
more
of
those
songs
of
drowned
people
and
you
will
be
afraid
no
longer
of
storms
or
listen
to
the
waves
at
night
and
when
you
have
got
quite
accustomed
to
london
and
got
a
great
many
friends
you
might
be
disposed
to
stay
there
altogether
and
you
would
grow
to
think
of
this
island
as
a
desolate
and
melancholy
place
and
never
seek
to
come
the
girl
rose
suddenly
and
turned
to
a
fuchsia
tree
pretending
to
pick
some
of
its
flowers
tears
had
sprung
to
her
eyes
unbidden
and
it
was
in
rather
an
uncertain
voice
that
she
said
still
managing
to
conceal
her
face
like
to
hear
you
talk
of
those
places
but
but
i
will
never
leave
what
possible
interest
could
he
have
in
combating
this
decision
so
anxiously
almost
so
imploringly
he
renewed
his
complaints
against
the
melancholy
of
the
sea
and
the
dreariness
of
the
northern
winters
he
described
again
and
again
the
brilliant
lights
and
colors
of
town
life
in
the
south
as
a
mere
matter
of
experience
and
education
she
ought
to
go
to
london
and
had
not
her
papa
as
good
as
intimated
his
intention
of
taking
her
in
the
midst
of
these
representations
a
step
was
heard
in
the
hall
and
then
the
girl
looked
around
with
a
bright
light
on
her
face
sheila
said
ingram
according
to
his
custom
and
both
the
hands
were
in
his
the
next
minute
are
down
early
what
have
you
been
about
have
you
been
telling
mr
lavender
about
the
black
horse
of
loch
suainabhal
mr
lavender
has
been
telling
me
of
i
have
been
trying
to
induce
miss
mackenzie
to
pay
us
a
visit
so
that
we
may
show
her
the
difference
between
a
city
and
an
island
but
all
to
no
purpose
miss
mackenzie
seems
to
like
hard
winters
and
darkness
and
cold
and
as
for
that
perpetual
and
melancholy
and
cruel
sea
that
in
the
winter
time
i
should
fancy
might
drive
anybody
into
a
lunatic
asylum
you
must
not
talk
badly
of
the
sea
said
the
girl
with
all
her
courage
and
brightness
returned
to
her
face
is
our
very
good
friend
it
gives
us
food
and
keeps
many
people
alive
it
carries
the
lads
away
to
other
places
and
brings
them
back
with
money
in
their
pockets
sometimes
it
smashes
a
few
of
them
on
the
rocks
or
swallows
up
a
dozen
families
and
the
next
morning
it
is
as
smooth
and
treacherous
and
fair
as
if
nothing
had
that
is
not
the
sea
at
all
said
sheila
is
the
storms
that
will
wreck
the
boats
and
how
can
the
sea
help
that
when
the
sea
is
left
alone
the
sea
is
very
good
to
ingram
laughed
aloud
and
patted
the
head
fondly
and
lavender
blushing
a
little
confessed
he
was
beaten
and
that
he
would
never
again
in
miss
presence
say
anything
against
the
sea
the
king
of
borva
now
appearing
they
all
went
in
to
breakfast
and
sheila
sat
opposite
the
window
so
that
all
the
light
coming
in
from
the
clear
sky
and
the
sea
was
reflected
upon
her
face
and
lit
up
every
varying
expression
that
crossed
it
or
that
shone
up
in
the
beautiful
deeps
of
her
eyes
lavender
his
own
face
in
shadow
could
look
at
her
from
time
to
time
himself
unseen
and
as
he
sat
in
almost
absolute
silence
and
noticed
how
she
talked
with
ingram
and
what
deference
she
paid
him
and
how
anxious
she
was
to
please
him
he
began
to
wonder
if
he
should
ever
be
admitted
to
a
like
friendship
with
her
it
was
so
strange
too
that
this
handsome
girl
should
so
devote
herself
to
the
amusement
of
a
man
like
ingram
and
forgetting
all
the
court
that
should
have
been
paid
to
a
pretty
woman
seem
determined
to
persuade
him
that
he
was
conferring
a
favor
upon
her
by
every
word
and
look
of
course
lavender
admitted
to
himself
ingram
was
a
very
good
sort
of
a
fellow
a
very
good
sort
of
a
fellow
indeed
if
any
one
was
in
a
scrape
about
money
ingram
would
come
to
the
rescue
without
a
hesitation
although
the
salary
of
a
clerk
in
the
board
of
trade
might
have
been
made
the
excuse
by
any
other
man
for
a
very
justifiable
refusal
he
was
very
clever
too
had
read
much
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
but
he
was
not
the
sort
of
man
you
might
expect
to
get
on
well
with
women
unless
with
very
intimate
friends
he
was
a
trifle
silent
and
reserved
often
he
was
inclined
to
be
pragmatic
and
sententious
and
had
a
habit
of
saying
unpleasantly
better
things
when
some
careless
joke
was
being
made
he
was
a
little
dingy
in
appearance
and
a
man
who
had
a
somewhat
cold
manner
who
was
sallow
of
face
who
was
obviously
getting
gray
and
who
was
generally
insignificant
in
appearance
was
not
the
sort
of
man
one
would
think
to
fascinate
an
exceptionally
handsome
girl
who
had
brains
enough
to
know
the
fineness
of
her
own
face
but
here
was
this
princess
paying
attentions
to
him
such
as
must
have
driven
a
more
impressionable
man
out
of
his
senses
while
ingram
sat
quiet
and
pleased
sometimes
making
fun
of
her
and
generally
talking
to
her
as
if
she
were
a
child
sheila
had
chatted
very
pleasantly
with
him
lavender
in
the
morning
but
it
was
evident
that
her
relations
with
ingram
were
of
a
very
different
kind
such
as
he
could
not
well
understand
for
it
was
scarcely
possible
that
she
could
be
in
love
with
ingram
and
yet
surely
the
pleasure
that
dwelt
in
her
expressive
face
when
she
spoke
to
him
or
listened
to
him
was
not
the
result
of
a
mere
friendship
if
lavender
had
been
told
at
that
moment
that
these
two
were
lovers
and
that
they
were
looking
forward
to
an
early
marriage
he
would
have
rejoiced
with
an
enthusiasm
of
joy
he
would
have
honestly
and
cordially
shaken
ingram
by
the
hand
he
would
have
made
plans
for
introducing
the
young
bride
to
all
the
people
he
knew
and
he
would
have
gone
straight
off
on
reaching
london
to
buy
sheila
a
diamond
necklace
even
if
he
had
to
borrow
the
money
from
ingram
himself
have
you
got
rid
of
the
sheila
said
ingram
suddenly
breaking
in
upon
these
dreams
does
every
owner
of
hens
still
pay
his
annual
shilling
to
the
lord
of
lewis
is
not
away
yet
said
the
girl
when
sir
james
comes
in
the
autumn
i
will
go
over
to
stornoway
and
ask
him
to
take
away
the
tax
and
i
know
he
will
do
it
for
what
is
the
shilling
worth
to
him
when
he
has
spent
thousands
and
thousands
of
pounds
on
the
lewis
but
it
will
be
very
hard
on
some
of
the
poor
people
that
only
keep
one
or
two
hens
and
i
will
tell
sir
james
of
all
that
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
sheila
said
her
father
impatiently
is
the
to
you
that
you
will
go
over
to
stornoway
only
to
be
laughed
at
and
make
a
fool
of
yourself
is
nothing
not
anything
at
all
said
the
girl
sir
james
will
only
take
away
the
sheila
they
would
treat
you
as
another
lady
godiva
said
ingram
with
a
smile
miss
mackenzie
is
quite
right
exclaimed
lavender
with
a
sudden
flush
of
color
leaping
into
his
handsome
face
and
an
honest
glow
of
admiration
into
his
eyes
think
it
is
a
very
noble
thing
for
her
to
do
and
nobody
either
in
stornoway
or
anywhere
else
would
be
such
a
brute
as
to
laugh
at
her
for
trying
to
help
those
poor
people
who
have
not
too
many
friends
and
defenders
god
ingram
looked
surprised
since
when
had
the
young
gentleman
across
the
table
acquired
such
a
singular
interest
in
the
poorer
classes
of
whose
very
existence
he
had
for
the
most
part
seemed
unaware
but
the
enthusiasm
in
his
face
seemed
quite
honest
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
that
as
for
sheila
with
a
beating
heart
she
ventured
to
send
to
her
companion
a
brief
and
timid
glance
of
gratitude
which
the
young
man
observed
and
never
forgot
will
not
know
what
it
is
all
about
said
the
king
of
borva
with
a
peevish
air
as
though
it
were
too
bad
that
a
person
of
his
authority
should
have
to
descend
to
details
about
a
petty
is
many
and
many
a
tax
and
a
due
sir
james
will
take
away
from
his
tenants
in
the
lewis
and
he
will
spend
more
money
a
thousand
times
than
ever
he
will
get
back
and
it
was
this
it
will
stand
in
the
place
of
a
great
many
things
taken
away
just
to
remind
the
folk
that
they
have
not
their
land
all
in
their
own
right
it
is
many
things
you
will
have
to
do
in
managing
the
poor
people
not
to
let
them
get
too
proud
or
forgetful
of
what
they
owe
to
you
and
now
there
is
no
more
tacksmen
to
be
the
masters
of
the
small
crofters
and
the
crofters
they
would
think
they
were
landlords
themselves
if
there
were
no
dues
for
them
to
have
heard
of
those
middlemen
they
were
dreadful
tyrants
and
thieves
they
said
lavender
ingram
kicked
his
foot
under
the
table
mean
that
was
the
popular
impression
of
them
a
vulgar
error
i
presume
continued
the
young
man
in
the
coolest
manner
so
you
have
got
rid
of
them
well
i
dare
say
many
of
them
were
honest
men
and
suffered
very
unjustly
in
common
mackenzie
answered
nothing
but
his
daughter
said
quickly
you
know
mr
lavender
they
have
not
gone
away
merely
because
they
cease
to
have
the
letting
of
the
land
to
the
crofters
they
have
still
their
old
holdings
and
so
have
the
crofters
in
most
cases
every
one
now
holds
direct
from
the
proprietor
that
is
that
there
is
no
difference
between
the
former
tacksman
and
his
serf
except
the
relative
size
of
their
farms
the
crofters
have
no
leases
but
the
tacksmen
have
said
the
girl
somewhat
timidly
and
then
she
added
you
have
not
decided
yet
ingram
what
you
will
do
it
is
too
clear
for
the
salmon
fishing
will
you
go
over
to
meavig
and
show
mr
lavender
the
bay
of
uig
and
the
seven
hunters
we
must
show
him
borvapost
first
sheila
said
ingram
saw
nothing
of
it
last
night
in
the
dark
and
i
think
if
you
offered
to
take
mr
lavender
around
in
your
boat
and
show
him
what
a
clever
sailor
you
are
he
would
prefer
that
to
walking
over
the
can
take
you
all
around
in
the
boat
certainly
said
the
girl
with
a
quick
blush
of
pleasure
and
forthwith
a
message
was
sent
to
duncan
that
cushions
should
be
taken
down
to
the
the
little
vessel
of
which
sheila
was
both
skipper
and
pilot
how
beautiful
was
the
fair
that
lay
around
them
as
the
stood
out
to
the
mouth
of
loch
roag
on
this
bright
summer
morning
sheila
sat
in
the
stern
of
the
small
boat
her
hand
on
the
tiller
lufrath
lay
at
her
feet
his
nose
between
the
long
and
shaggy
paws
duncan
grave
and
watchful
as
to
the
wind
and
the
points
of
the
coast
sat
amidships
with
the
sheets
of
the
mainsail
held
fast
and
superintended
the
seamanship
of
his
young
mistress
with
a
respectful
but
most
evident
pride
and
as
ingram
had
gone
off
with
mackenzie
to
walk
over
the
white
water
before
going
down
to
borvapost
frank
lavender
was
sole
companion
out
in
this
wonderland
of
rock
and
sea
and
blue
sky
he
did
not
talk
much
to
her
and
she
was
so
well
occupied
with
the
boat
that
he
could
regard
with
impunity
the
shifting
lights
and
graces
of
her
face
and
all
the
wonder
and
winning
depths
of
her
eyes
the
sea
was
blue
around
them
the
sky
overhead
had
not
a
speck
of
cloud
in
it
the
white
the
green
stretches
of
pasture
and
the
far
and
spectral
mountains
trembled
in
a
haze
of
sunlight
then
there
was
all
the
delight
of
the
fresh
and
cool
wind
the
hissing
of
the
water
along
the
boat
and
the
joyous
rapidity
with
which
the
small
vessel
lying
over
a
little
ran
through
the
crisply
curling
waters
and
brought
into
view
the
newer
wonders
of
the
opening
sea
was
it
not
all
a
dream
that
he
should
be
sitting
by
the
side
of
this
who
was
attended
only
by
her
deerhound
and
the
tall
keeper
and
if
a
dream
why
should
it
not
go
on
forever
to
live
forever
in
this
magic
land
to
have
the
princess
herself
carry
him
in
this
little
boat
into
the
quiet
bays
of
the
islands
or
out
at
night
in
the
moonlight
on
the
open
sea
to
forget
forever
the
godless
south
and
its
social
phantasmagoria
and
live
in
this
beautiful
and
distant
solitude
with
the
solemn
secrets
of
the
hills
and
the
moving
deep
forever
present
to
the
imagination
might
not
that
be
a
nobler
life
and
some
day
or
other
he
would
take
this
up
to
london
and
he
would
bid
the
women
that
he
knew
the
scheming
mothers
and
the
daughters
stand
aside
from
before
this
perfect
work
of
god
she
would
carry
with
her
the
mystery
of
the
sea
in
the
deeps
of
her
eyes
and
the
music
of
the
far
hills
would
be
heard
in
her
voice
and
all
the
sweetness
and
purity
and
brightness
of
the
clear
summer
skies
would
be
mirrored
in
her
innocent
soul
she
would
appear
in
london
as
some
bird
hailing
from
distant
climes
and
before
she
had
lived
there
long
enough
to
grow
sad
and
have
the
weight
of
the
city
cloud
the
brightness
of
her
eyes
she
would
be
spirited
away
again
into
this
strange
where
there
seemed
to
be
perpetual
sunshine
and
the
light
music
of
the
waves
poor
sheila
she
little
knew
what
was
expected
of
her
or
the
sort
of
drama
into
which
she
was
being
thrown
as
a
central
figure
she
little
knew
that
she
a
simple
highland
girl
was
being
transformed
into
a
wonderful
creature
of
romance
who
was
to
put
to
shame
the
gentle
dames
and
maidens
of
london
society
and
do
many
other
extraordinary
things
but
what
would
have
appeared
the
most
extraordinary
of
all
these
speculations
if
she
had
only
known
of
them
was
the
assumption
that
she
would
marry
frank
lavender
the
young
man
had
quite
naturally
taken
for
granted
but
perhaps
only
as
a
basis
for
his
imaginative
scenes
in
order
to
do
these
fine
things
she
would
have
to
be
married
to
somebody
and
why
not
to
himself
think
of
the
pride
he
would
have
in
leading
this
beautiful
girl
with
her
quaint
manners
and
fashion
of
speech
into
a
london
would
not
every
one
wish
to
know
her
would
not
everyone
listen
to
her
singing
of
those
gaelic
songs
for
of
course
she
must
sing
well
would
not
all
his
artist
friends
be
anxious
to
paint
her
and
she
would
go
to
the
academy
to
convince
the
loungers
there
how
utterly
the
canvas
had
failed
to
catch
the
light
and
dignity
and
sweetness
of
her
face
when
sheila
spoke
he
started
you
not
see
it
seal
it
rose
for
a
moment
just
over
there
said
the
girl
with
a
great
interest
visible
in
her
eyes
the
beautiful
dreams
he
had
been
dreaming
were
considerably
shattered
by
this
interruption
how
could
a
fairy
princess
be
so
interested
in
some
common
animal
showing
its
head
out
of
the
sea
it
also
occurred
to
him
just
at
this
moment
that
if
sheila
and
mairi
went
out
in
this
boat
by
themselves
they
must
be
in
the
habit
of
hoisting
up
the
mainsail
and
was
such
rude
and
coarse
work
befitting
the
character
of
a
princess
looks
very
like
a
black
man
in
the
water
when
his
head
comes
up
said
sheila
the
water
is
smooth
so
that
you
will
see
him
look
at
you
but
i
have
not
told
you
yet
about
the
black
horse
that
saw
at
loch
suainabhal
one
night
loch
suainabhal
that
is
inland
and
fresh
water
so
it
was
not
a
seal
but
alister
was
going
along
the
shore
and
he
saw
it
lying
up
by
the
road
and
he
looked
at
it
for
a
long
time
it
was
quite
black
and
he
thought
it
was
a
boat
but
when
he
came
near
he
saw
it
begin
to
move
and
then
it
went
down
across
the
shore
and
splashed
into
the
loch
and
it
had
a
head
bigger
than
a
horse
and
quite
black
and
it
made
a
noise
as
it
went
down
the
shore
to
the
you
think
alister
must
have
been
taking
a
little
whisky
miss
mackenzie
not
that
for
he
came
to
me
just
after
he
will
see
the
do
you
really
believe
he
saw
such
an
animal
said
lavender
with
a
smile
do
not
know
said
the
girl
gravely
it
was
only
a
fright
and
he
imagined
he
saw
it
but
i
do
not
know
it
is
impossible
there
can
be
such
an
animal
at
loch
suainabhal
but
that
is
nothing
it
is
of
no
consequence
but
i
have
seen
stranger
things
than
the
black
horse
that
many
people
will
not
i
ask
what
they
are
he
said
gently
other
time
perhaps
i
will
tell
you
but
there
is
much
explanation
about
it
and
you
see
we
are
going
in
to
was
this
then
the
capital
of
the
small
empire
over
which
the
princess
ruled
he
saw
before
him
but
a
long
row
of
small
huts
or
hovels
resembling
beehives
which
stood
above
the
curve
of
a
white
bay
and
at
one
portion
of
the
bay
was
a
small
creek
near
which
a
number
of
large
boats
bottom
upward
lay
on
the
beach
what
odd
little
dwellings
those
were
the
walls
a
few
feet
high
were
built
of
rude
blocks
of
stone
or
slices
of
turf
and
from
those
low
supports
rose
a
rounded
roof
of
straw
which
was
thatched
over
by
a
further
layer
of
turf
there
were
few
windows
and
no
chimneys
at
all
not
even
a
hole
in
the
roof
and
what
was
meant
by
the
two
men
who
standing
on
one
of
the
turf
walls
were
busily
engaged
in
digging
into
the
rich
brown
and
black
thatch
and
heaving
it
into
a
cart
sheila
had
to
explain
to
him
that
while
she
was
doing
everything
in
her
power
to
get
the
people
to
suffer
the
introduction
of
windows
it
was
hopeless
to
think
of
chimneys
for
by
carefully
guarding
against
the
egress
of
the
peat
smoke
it
slowly
saturated
the
thatch
of
the
roof
which
at
certain
periods
of
the
year
was
then
taken
off
to
dress
the
fields
and
a
new
roof
of
straw
put
on
by
this
time
they
had
run
the
the
into
a
creek
and
were
climbing
up
the
steep
beach
of
shingle
that
had
been
worn
smooth
by
the
unquiet
waters
of
the
atlantic
will
you
want
to
speak
to
me
ailasa
said
sheila
turning
to
a
small
girl
who
had
approached
her
somewhat
diffidently
she
was
a
pretty
little
thing
with
a
round
fair
face
tanned
by
the
sun
brown
hair
and
soft
dark
eyes
she
was
and
but
she
was
otherwise
smartly
dressed
and
she
held
in
her
hand
an
enormous
flounder
apparently
about
half
as
heavy
as
herself
ye
hef
the
fesh
miss
sheila
said
the
small
ailasa
holding
out
the
flounder
but
looking
down
all
the
same
you
catch
it
yourself
ailasa
it
wass
donald
and
me
we
wass
out
in
a
boat
and
donald
had
a
it
is
a
present
for
me
said
sheila
patting
the
small
head
and
its
wild
and
soft
hair
you
ailasa
but
you
must
ask
donald
to
carry
it
up
to
the
house
and
give
it
to
mairi
i
can
not
take
it
with
me
just
now
you
there
was
a
small
boy
cowering
behind
one
of
the
upturned
boats
and
by
his
furtive
peepings
showing
that
he
was
in
league
with
his
sister
ailasa
not
thinking
that
she
was
discovering
his
whereabouts
turned
quite
naturally
in
that
direction
until
she
was
suddenly
stopped
by
lavender
who
called
to
her
and
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
but
he
was
too
late
sheila
had
stepped
in
and
with
a
quick
look
which
was
all
the
protest
that
was
needed
shut
her
hand
over
the
half
crown
he
had
in
his
fingers
mind
ailasa
she
said
away
and
get
donald
and
bid
him
carry
the
fish
up
to
lavender
put
up
the
in
his
pocket
in
a
somewhat
dazed
fashion
what
he
chiefly
knew
was
that
sheila
had
for
a
moment
held
his
hand
in
hers
and
that
her
eyes
had
met
his
well
that
little
incident
of
ailasa
and
the
flounder
was
rather
pleasant
to
him
it
did
not
shock
the
romantic
associations
he
had
begun
to
weave
around
his
fair
companion
but
when
they
had
gone
up
to
the
cottages
mackenzie
and
ingram
not
yet
having
arrived
and
when
sheila
proceeded
to
tell
him
about
the
circumstances
of
the
lives
and
to
explain
how
such
and
such
things
were
done
in
the
fields
and
and
so
forth
lavender
was
a
little
disappointed
sheila
took
him
into
some
of
the
cottages
or
rather
hovels
and
he
vaguely
knew
in
the
darkness
that
she
sat
down
by
the
low
glow
of
the
and
began
to
ask
the
women
about
all
sorts
of
improvements
in
the
walls
and
windows
and
gardens
and
what
not
surely
it
was
not
for
a
princess
to
go
advising
people
about
particular
sorts
of
soap
or
offering
to
pay
for
a
pane
of
glass
if
the
husband
of
the
woman
would
make
the
necessary
aperture
in
the
the
picture
of
sheila
appearing
as
a
in
a
london
was
all
very
beautiful
in
its
way
but
here
she
was
discussing
as
to
the
quality
given
to
broth
by
the
addition
of
a
certain
vegetable
which
she
offered
to
send
down
from
her
own
garden
if
the
cottager
in
question
would
try
to
grow
it
wonder
miss
mackenzie
he
said
at
length
when
they
got
outside
his
eyes
dazed
with
the
light
and
smarting
with
the
wonder
you
can
trouble
yourself
with
such
little
matters
that
those
people
should
find
out
for
the
girl
looked
up
with
some
surprise
is
the
work
i
have
to
do
my
papa
can
not
do
everything
in
the
what
is
the
necessity
for
your
bothering
yourself
about
such
things
surely
they
ought
to
be
able
to
look
after
their
own
gardens
and
houses
it
is
no
degradation
certainly
not
for
anything
you
interested
yourself
in
would
become
worthy
of
attention
by
the
very
fact
but
after
all
it
seems
such
a
pity
you
should
give
up
your
time
to
these
commonplace
some
one
must
do
it
said
the
girl
quite
innocently
my
papa
has
no
time
and
they
will
be
very
good
in
doing
what
i
ask
them
everyone
in
the
was
this
a
willful
affectation
he
said
to
himself
or
was
she
really
incapable
of
understanding
that
there
was
anything
incongruous
in
a
young
lady
of
her
position
education
and
refinement
busying
herself
with
the
curing
of
fish
and
the
cost
of
lime
he
had
himself
marked
the
incongruity
long
ago
when
ingram
had
been
telling
him
of
the
remote
and
beautiful
maiden
whose
only
notions
of
the
world
had
been
derived
from
literature
who
was
more
familiar
with
the
magic
land
in
which
endymion
wandered
than
with
any
other
and
that
at
the
same
time
she
was
about
as
good
as
her
father
at
planning
a
wooden
bridge
over
a
stream
when
lavender
had
got
outside
again
when
he
found
himself
walking
with
her
along
the
white
beach
in
front
of
the
blue
atlantic
she
was
again
the
princess
of
his
dreams
he
looked
at
her
face
and
he
saw
in
her
eyes
that
she
must
be
familiar
with
all
the
romantic
nooks
and
glades
of
english
poetry
the
plashing
of
the
waves
down
there
and
the
music
of
her
voice
recalled
the
sad
legends
of
the
fishermen
he
hoped
to
hear
her
sing
but
ever
and
anon
there
occurred
a
jarring
recollection
whether
arising
from
a
contradiction
between
his
notion
of
sheila
and
the
actual
sheila
or
whether
from
some
incongruity
in
itself
he
did
not
stop
to
consider
he
only
knew
that
a
beautiful
maiden
who
had
lived
by
the
sea
all
her
life
and
who
had
followed
the
wanderings
of
endymion
in
the
enchanted
forest
need
not
have
been
so
particular
about
a
method
of
boiling
potatoes
or
have
shown
so
much
interest
in
a
pattern
for
frocks
mackenzie
and
ingram
met
them
there
was
the
usual
sheila
followed
by
a
thousand
questions
about
the
very
things
she
had
been
inquiring
into
that
was
one
of
the
odd
points
about
ingram
that
puzzled
and
sometimes
vexed
lavender
for
if
you
are
walking
home
at
night
it
is
inconvenient
to
be
accompanied
by
a
friend
who
would
stop
to
ask
about
the
circumstances
of
some
old
crone
hobbling
along
the
pavement
or
who
could
on
his
own
stop
to
have
a
chat
with
a
garrulous
policeman
ingram
was
about
as
odd
as
sheila
herself
in
the
attention
he
paid
to
those
wretched
cotters
and
their
doings
he
could
not
advise
on
the
important
subject
of
broth
but
he
would
have
tasted
it
by
way
of
discovery
even
if
it
had
been
presented
to
him
in
a
he
had
already
been
prowling
around
the
place
with
mackenzie
he
had
inspected
the
apparatus
in
the
creek
for
hauling
up
the
boats
he
had
visited
the
curing
houses
he
had
examined
the
heaps
of
fish
drying
on
the
beach
he
had
drunk
whisky
with
john
the
piper
and
shaken
hands
with
and
now
he
had
come
to
tell
sheila
that
the
piper
was
bringing
down
luncheon
from
house
and
that
after
they
had
eaten
and
drunk
on
the
white
beach
they
would
put
out
the
once
more
to
sea
and
sail
over
to
mevaig
that
the
stranger
might
see
the
wondrous
sands
of
the
bay
of
uig
but
it
was
not
in
consonance
with
the
dignity
of
a
king
that
his
guests
should
eat
from
off
the
pebbles
like
so
many
fishermen
and
when
mairi
and
another
girl
brought
down
the
baskets
luncheon
was
placed
in
the
stern
of
the
small
vessel
while
duncan
got
up
the
sails
and
put
out
from
the
stone
quay
as
for
john
the
piper
was
he
insulted
for
having
been
sent
on
a
menial
errand
they
had
scarcely
got
away
from
the
shore
when
the
sounds
of
the
pipes
were
wafted
to
them
from
the
hillside
above
and
it
was
the
of
that
followed
them
out
to
sea
mackrimmon
shall
no
more
return
oh
never
never
more
return
that
was
the
wild
and
ominous
air
that
was
skirling
up
on
the
hillside
and
face
as
he
heard
it
grew
wroth
teffle
of
a
piper
john
he
said
be
playing
till
mi
tuiligh
is
out
of
mischief
papa
said
sheila
is
will
be
more
than
mischief
if
i
burn
his
pipes
and
drive
him
out
of
borva
then
there
will
be
no
more
of
is
very
bad
of
john
to
do
that
said
sheila
to
lavender
apparently
in
explanation
of
her
anger
we
have
given
him
shelter
here
when
there
will
be
no
more
pipes
in
all
the
lewis
it
was
the
free
church
ministers
they
put
down
the
pipes
for
there
was
too
much
wildness
at
the
marriages
when
the
pipes
would
what
do
the
people
dance
to
now
asked
the
young
gentleman
who
seemed
to
resent
this
paternal
government
sheila
laughed
in
an
embarrassed
way
mackenzie
would
rather
not
tell
you
said
ingram
fact
is
the
noble
mountaineers
of
these
districts
have
had
to
fall
back
on
the
harp
the
ministers
allow
the
instrument
to
be
used
i
suppose
because
there
is
a
look
of
piety
in
the
name
but
the
dancing
get
very
mad
when
you
have
two
or
three
young
fellows
playing
a
strathspey
on
a
bit
of
a
trembling
teffle
of
a
piper
john
growled
mackenzie
under
his
breath
and
so
the
lightly
sped
on
her
way
opening
out
the
various
headlands
of
the
islands
until
at
last
she
got
into
the
narrows
by
and
ran
up
the
long
arm
of
the
sea
to
mevaig
they
landed
and
went
up
the
rocks
they
passed
two
or
three
small
white
houses
overlooking
the
still
green
waters
of
the
sea
and
then
following
the
line
of
a
river
plunged
into
the
heart
of
a
strange
and
lonely
district
in
which
there
appeared
to
be
no
life
the
river
track
took
them
up
a
green
glen
the
sides
of
which
were
about
as
sheer
as
a
railway
cutting
there
were
no
trees
or
bushes
about
but
the
green
pasture
along
the
bed
of
the
valley
wore
its
brightest
colors
in
the
warm
sunlight
and
far
up
on
the
hillsides
the
browns
and
crimsons
of
the
heather
and
the
silver
gray
of
the
rocks
trembled
in
the
white
haze
of
the
heat
over
that
again
the
blue
sky
as
still
and
silent
as
the
world
below
they
wandered
on
content
with
idleness
and
a
fine
day
mackenzie
was
talking
with
some
little
loudness
so
that
lavender
might
hear
of
john
stuart
mill
and
was
anxious
to
convey
to
ted
ingram
that
a
wise
man
who
is
responsible
for
the
of
his
fellow
creatures
will
study
all
sides
of
all
questions
however
dangerous
sheila
was
doing
her
best
to
entertain
the
stranger
and
he
in
a
dream
of
his
own
was
listening
to
the
information
she
gave
him
how
much
of
it
did
he
carry
away
he
was
told
that
the
gray
goose
built
its
nest
in
the
rushes
at
the
edge
of
lakes
sheila
knew
several
nests
in
borva
sheila
also
caught
the
young
of
the
wild
duck
when
the
mother
was
guiding
them
down
the
to
the
sea
she
had
tamed
many
of
them
catching
them
thus
before
they
could
fly
the
names
of
most
of
the
mountains
about
here
ended
in
which
was
a
gaelic
corruption
of
the
norse
a
mountain
there
were
many
norse
names
all
through
the
lewis
but
more
particularly
towards
the
butt
the
termination
for
example
at
the
end
of
many
words
meant
an
inhabited
place
but
she
fancied
was
danish
and
did
mr
lavender
know
of
the
legend
connected
with
the
air
of
till
cha
till
mi
tuille
lavender
started
as
from
a
trance
with
an
impression
that
he
had
been
desperately
rude
he
was
about
to
say
that
the
gray
gosling
in
the
legend
could
not
speak
scandinavian
when
he
was
interrupted
by
mackenzie
turning
and
asking
him
if
he
knew
from
what
ports
the
english
smacks
hailed
that
came
up
hither
to
the
cod
and
the
ling
fishing
for
a
couple
of
months
in
the
autumn
the
young
man
said
he
did
not
know
there
were
many
fishermen
at
brighton
and
when
the
king
of
borva
turned
to
ingram
to
see
why
he
was
shouting
with
laughter
sheila
suddenly
announced
to
the
party
that
before
them
lay
the
great
bay
of
uig
it
was
certainly
a
strange
and
impressive
scene
they
stood
on
the
top
of
a
lofty
range
of
hills
and
underneath
them
lay
a
vast
semicircle
miles
in
extent
of
gleaming
white
sand
that
had
in
ages
been
washed
in
by
the
atlantic
into
this
vast
plain
of
silver
whiteness
the
sea
entering
by
a
somewhat
narrow
portal
stretched
in
long
arms
of
a
pale
blue
elsewhere
the
great
crescent
of
sand
was
surrounded
by
a
low
line
of
rocky
hill
showing
a
thousand
tints
of
and
gray
and
heather
purple
and
beyond
that
again
rose
the
giant
bulk
of
mealasabhal
grown
pale
in
the
heat
into
the
southern
sky
there
was
not
a
ship
visible
along
the
blue
plain
of
the
atlantic
the
only
human
habitation
to
be
seen
in
the
strange
world
beneath
them
was
a
solitary
manse
but
away
toward
the
summit
of
mealasabhal
two
specks
slowly
circled
in
the
air
which
sheila
thought
were
eagles
and
far
out
on
the
western
sea
lying
like
dusky
whales
in
the
vague
blue
were
the
plada
islands
the
remote
and
unvisited
seven
hunters
whose
only
inhabitants
are
certain
flocks
of
sheep
belonging
to
dwellers
on
the
main
land
of
lewis
the
travelers
sat
down
on
a
low
rock
of
gneiss
to
rest
themselves
and
then
and
there
did
the
king
of
borva
recite
his
grievances
and
rage
against
the
english
smacks
was
it
not
enough
that
they
should
in
passing
steal
the
sheep
but
that
they
should
also
in
mere
wantonness
stalk
them
as
deer
wounding
them
with
rifle
bullets
and
leaving
them
to
die
among
the
rocks
sheila
said
bravely
that
no
one
could
tell
that
it
was
the
english
fishermen
who
did
that
why
not
the
crews
of
merchant
vessels
who
might
be
of
any
nation
it
was
unfair
to
charge
upon
any
body
of
men
such
a
despicable
act
when
there
was
no
proof
of
it
whatever
sheila
said
ingram
with
some
surprise
never
doubted
before
that
it
was
the
english
smacks
that
killed
the
sheila
cast
down
her
eyes
and
said
nothing
was
the
sinister
prophecy
of
john
the
piper
to
be
fulfilled
mackenzie
was
so
much
engaged
in
expounding
politics
to
ingram
and
sheila
was
so
proud
to
show
her
companion
all
the
wonders
of
uig
that
when
they
returned
to
mevaig
in
the
evening
the
wind
had
altogether
gone
down
and
the
sea
was
as
a
sea
of
glass
but
if
john
the
piper
had
been
ready
to
foretell
for
mackenzie
the
fate
of
mackrimmon
he
had
taken
means
to
defeat
destiny
by
bringing
over
from
borvapost
a
large
and
heavy
boat
pulled
by
six
rowers
these
were
not
strapping
young
fellows
clad
in
the
best
blue
cloth
to
be
got
in
stornoway
but
elderly
men
gray
wrinkled
and
hard
of
face
who
sat
stolidly
in
the
boat
and
listened
with
a
sort
of
bovine
gaze
to
the
old
wicked
stories
and
jokes
john
was
in
a
mischievous
mood
but
lavender
in
a
confidential
whisper
informed
sheila
that
her
father
would
speedily
be
avenged
on
the
inconsiderate
piper
men
sing
us
a
song
quick
said
mackenzie
as
the
party
took
their
seats
in
the
stern
and
the
great
oars
splashed
into
the
sea
of
gold
sharp
john
and
no
teffle
of
a
drowning
song
in
a
shrill
high
querulous
voice
the
piper
who
was
himself
pulling
one
of
the
two
stroke
oars
began
to
sing
and
then
the
men
behind
him
gathering
courage
joined
in
an
octave
lower
their
voices
being
even
more
uncertain
and
lugubrious
than
his
own
these
poor
fishermen
had
not
had
the
musical
education
of
warriors
the
performance
was
not
enlivening
and
as
the
monotonous
and
melancholy
that
kept
time
to
the
oars
told
its
story
in
gaelic
all
that
the
english
strangers
could
make
out
was
an
occasional
reference
to
jura
or
scarba
or
isla
it
was
indeed
the
song
of
an
exile
shut
up
in
mull
who
was
complaining
of
the
wearisome
look
of
the
neighboring
islands
why
do
you
sing
such
gaelic
as
that
john
said
young
lavender
confidently
should
have
thought
a
man
in
your
position
the
last
of
the
hebridean
bards
would
have
known
the
classical
gaelic
you
know
the
classical
gaelic
iss
only
the
wan
sort
of
kâllic
and
it
is
a
ferry
goot
sort
of
kâllic
said
the
piper
with
some
show
of
petulance
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
know
your
own
tongue
do
you
not
know
what
the
greatest
of
all
the
bards
wrote
about
your
own
island
et

et
dulce
decus
meum
tityre
tu

recubans
sub
tegmine
arma
virumque
cano
et
sub

fagi
not
only
john
the
piper
but
all
the
men
behind
him
began
to
look
amazed
and
sorely
troubled
and
all
the
more
so
that
ingram
who
had
picked
up
more
gaelic
words
than
his
friend
came
to
his
assistance
and
began
to
talk
to
him
in
this
unknown
tongue
they
heard
references
in
the
conversation
to
persons
and
things
with
which
they
were
familiar
in
their
own
language
but
still
accompanied
by
much
more
they
could
not
understand
the
men
now
began
to
whisper
questions
to
each
other
and
at
last
john
the
piper
could
not
restrain
his
curiosity
in
the
name
of
kott
is
tat
sort
of
kâllic
he
asked
with
some
look
of
fear
in
his
eyes
are
not
such
a
student
john
said
lavender
carelessly
still
a
man
in
your
position
should
know
something
of
your
own
language
a
bard
a
poet
and
not
know
the
classical
form
of
your
own
tongue
it
ta
welsh
kâllic
cried
john
in
desperation
for
he
knew
that
the
men
behind
him
would
carry
the
story
of
his
ignorance
all
over
borvapost
welsh
gaelic
no
i
see
you
will
have
to
go
to
school
iss
no
more
kâllic
in
ta
schools
said
the
piper
eagerly
seizing
the
excuse
iss
miss
sheila
she
will
hef
put
away
all
ta
kâllic
from
ta
you
were
born
half
a
century
before
miss
sheila
how
is
it
that
you
neglected
to
learn
that
form
of
gaelic
that
has
been
sacred
to
the
use
of
the
bards
and
poets
since
the
time
of
ossian
there
were
no
more
quips
or
cranks
for
john
the
piper
during
the
rest
of
the
pull
home
the
wretched
man
relapsed
into
a
moody
silence
and
worked
methodically
at
his
oar
brooding
over
this
mysterious
language
of
which
he
had
not
even
heard
as
for
lavender
he
turned
to
mackenzie
and
begged
to
know
what
he
thought
of
affairs
in
france
and
so
they
sailed
back
to
borvapost
over
the
smooth
water
that
lay
like
a
lake
of
gold
was
it
not
a
strange
sight
to
see
the
atlantic
one
vast
and
smooth
yellow
plain
under
the
great
glow
of
saffron
that
spread
across
the
regions
of
the
sunset
it
was
a
world
of
light
unbroken
but
by
the
presence
of
a
heavy
coaster
that
had
anchored
in
the
bay
and
that
sent
a
long
line
of
trembling
black
down
on
the
perfect
mirror
of
the
sea
as
they
got
near
the
shore
the
portions
that
were
in
shadow
showed
with
a
strange
distinctness
the
dark
green
of
the
pasture
and
the
sharp
outlines
of
the
rocks
and
there
was
a
cold
scent
of
in
the
evening
air
the
six
heavy
oars
plashed
into
the
smooth
bay
the
big
boat
was
moored
to
the
quay
and
its
passengers
landed
once
more
in
borva
and
when
they
turned
on
their
way
home
to
look
from
the
brow
of
the
hill
on
which
sheila
had
placed
a
garden
seat
lo
all
the
west
was
on
fire
the
mountains
in
the
south
had
grown
dark
on
their
eastern
side
and
the
plain
of
the
sea
was
like
a
lake
of
blood
with
the
heavy
hull
and
masts
of
the
coaster
grown
large
and
solemn
and
distant
there
was
scarcely
a
ripple
around
the
rocks
at
their
feet
to
break
the
stillness
of
the
approaching
twilight
so
another
day
had
passed
devoid
of
adventure
or
incident
lavender
had
not
rescued
his
wonderful
princess
from
an
angry
sea
nor
had
he
shown
prowess
in
slaying
a
dozen
stags
nor
in
any
way
distinguished
himself
to
all
outward
appearance
the
relations
of
the
party
were
the
same
at
night
as
they
had
been
in
the
morning
but
the
greatest
crises
of
life
steal
on
us
imperceptibly
and
have
sometimes
occurred
and
wound
us
in
their
consequences
before
we
know
the
memorable
things
in
a
career
are
not
always
marked
by
some
sharp
convulsion
the
youth
does
not
necessarily
marry
the
girl
whom
he
happens
to
fish
out
of
a
his
life
may
be
far
more
definitely
shaped
for
him
at
a
prosaic
where
he
fancies
he
is
only
thinking
of
the
wines
we
are
indeed
but
as
children
seated
on
the
shore
watching
the
ripples
that
come
on
to
our
feet
and
while
the
ripples
unceasingly
repeat
themselves
and
while
the
hour
that
passes
is
but
as
the
hour
before
it
constellation
after
constellation
has
gone
by
over
our
heads
unheeded
and
we
wake
with
a
start
to
find
ourselves
in
a
new
day
with
all
our
former
life
cut
off
from
us
and
become
as
a
dream
chapter
sheila
sings
a
knocking
at
door
the
matter
ye
be
to
ta
ingram
that
you
duncan
how
the
devil
have
you
got
over
from
mevaig
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
there
wass
a
bit
breeze
tis
morning
and
i
hef
prought
over
ta
and
there
iss
a
very
good
ripple
on
ta
water
if
you
will
tak
ta
other
gentleman
to
try
for
ta
right
hammer
at
his
door
until
he
gets
up
i
shall
be
ready
in
ten
about
half
an
hour
thereafter
the
two
young
men
were
standing
at
the
front
of
house
examining
the
enormous
rod
that
duncan
had
placed
against
the
porch
it
was
still
early
morning
and
there
was
a
cold
wind
blowing
in
from
the
sea
but
there
was
not
a
speck
of
cloud
in
the
sky
and
the
day
promised
to
be
hot
the
plain
of
the
atlantic
was
no
longer
a
sheet
of
glass
it
was
rough
and
gray
and
far
out
an
occasional
quiver
of
white
showed
where
a
wave
was
hissing
over
there
was
not
much
of
a
sea
on
but
the
heavy
wash
of
the
water
around
the
rocks
and
sandy
bays
could
be
distinctly
heard
in
the
silence
of
the
morning
and
what
was
this
moving
object
down
there
by
the
shore
where
the
lay
at
anchor
both
the
young
men
at
once
recognized
the
glimmer
of
the
small
white
feather
and
the
blue
dress
of
the
there
is
sheila
cried
ingram
in
all
the
world
is
she
about
at
such
an
hour
at
this
moment
duncan
came
out
with
a
book
of
flies
in
his
hand
and
he
said
in
rather
a
petulant
way
it
iss
no
wonder
miss
sheila
will
be
out
and
it
was
miss
sheila
herself
will
tell
me
to
see
if
you
will
go
to
ta
white
water
and
try
for
a
she
is
bringing
up
something
from
the
boat
i
must
go
and
carry
it
for
her
said
lavender
making
down
the
path
to
the
shore
with
the
speed
of
a
deer
when
sheila
and
he
came
up
the
hill
there
was
a
fine
color
in
the
face
from
her
exertions
but
she
was
not
disposed
to
go
to
rest
on
the
contrary
she
was
soon
engaged
in
helping
mairi
to
bring
in
some
coffee
to
the
parlor
while
duncan
cut
slices
of
ham
and
cold
beef
big
enough
to
have
provisioned
a
bound
for
caithness
sheila
had
had
her
breakfast
so
she
devoted
all
her
time
to
waiting
upon
her
guests
until
lavender
could
scarcely
eat
through
the
embarrassment
produced
by
her
noble
servitude
ingram
was
not
so
sensitive
and
made
a
very
good
meal
indeed
your
father
sheila
said
ingram
when
the
last
of
their
preparations
had
been
made
and
they
were
about
to
start
for
the
river
he
up
yet
father
said
the
girl
with
the
least
possible
elevation
of
her
eyebrows
will
be
down
at
borvapost
an
hour
ago
and
i
hope
that
john
the
piper
will
not
see
him
this
morning
but
we
must
make
haste
ingram
for
the
wind
will
fall
when
the
sun
gets
stronger
and
then
your
friend
will
have
no
more
of
the
so
they
set
out
and
ingram
put
hand
on
his
arm
and
took
her
along
with
him
in
that
fashion
while
the
tall
gillie
walked
behind
with
lavender
who
was
or
was
not
pleased
with
the
arrangement
the
young
man
indeed
was
a
trifle
silent
but
duncan
was
in
an
amiable
and
communicative
mood
and
passed
the
time
in
telling
him
stories
of
the
salmon
he
had
caught
and
of
the
people
who
had
tried
to
catch
them
and
failed
sheila
and
ingram
certainly
went
a
good
pace
up
the
hill
and
around
the
summit
of
it
and
down
again
into
the
valley
of
the
white
water
the
light
step
of
the
girl
seemed
to
be
as
full
of
spring
as
the
heather
on
which
she
trod
and
as
for
her
feet
getting
wet
the
dew
must
have
soaked
them
long
ago
she
was
in
the
brightest
of
spirits
lavender
could
hear
her
laughing
in
a
low
pleased
fashion
and
then
presently
her
head
would
be
turned
up
toward
her
companion
and
all
the
light
of
some
humorous
anecdote
would
appear
in
her
face
and
in
her
eloquent
eyes
and
it
would
be
turn
to
break
out
into
one
of
those
short
abrupt
laughs
that
had
something
sardonic
in
them
but
hark
from
the
other
side
of
the
valley
comes
another
sound
the
faint
and
distant
skirl
of
the
pipes
and
yonder
is
the
hunchback
a
mere
speck
in
a
waste
of
brown
and
green
morass
what
is
he
playing
to
himself
now
is
a
foolish
fellow
that
john
said
the
tall
keeper
if
he
comes
down
to
borvapost
this
morning
it
iss
mackenzie
will
fling
his
pipes
in
ta
sea
and
he
will
haf
to
go
away
and
work
in
ta
steamboat
he
iss
a
very
foolish
fellow
and
it
wass
him
tat
wass
in
ta
steamboat
before
and
he
went
to
a
tailor
in
styornoway
and
he
said
to
him
want
a
pair
and
the
tailor
said
to
him
sort
troosers
iss
it
you
will
want
and
he
said
to
him
want
a
pair
troosers
for
a
a
pair
troosers
for
a
steamboat
he
is
a
teffle
of
a
foolish
fellow
and
it
wass
him
that
went
in
ta
steamboat
with
a
lot
freens
his
that
wass
a
to
skye
to
a
big
there
and
it
wass
a
very
bad
passage
and
when
tey
got
into
portree
the
captain
said
to
him
where
iss
all
your
freens
that
tey
do
not
come
ashore
and
he
said
to
him
hef
peen
down
below
sir
and
ta
whole
them
are
and
sick
and
ta
whole
them
and
he
iss
just
the
ferry
man
to
laugh
at
every
other
pody
when
it
iss
a
mistake
you
will
make
in
ta
suppose
said
lavender
found
it
rather
difficult
to
learn
good
english
sir
i
hefna
got
ta
good
english
yet
but
miss
sheila
she
has
put
away
all
the
gaelic
from
the
schools
and
the
young
ones
they
will
learn
more
of
ta
good
english
after
wish
i
knew
as
much
gaelic
as
you
know
english
said
the
young
man
you
will
soon
learn
it
iss
ferry
easy
if
you
will
only
stay
in
ta
would
take
me
several
months
to
pick
it
up
i
suppose
yes
nine
or
six
that
will
do
said
duncan
will
begin
to
learn
ta
names
ta
islands
and
ta
places
there
now
as
far
as
you
can
see
is
ta
seann
bheinn
and
it
means
ta
old
hill
and
there
is
a
rock
there
it
is
here
duncan
looked
rather
perplexed
said
lavender
does
that
mean
means
it
means
said
duncan
in
still
greater
perplexity
and
getting
a
little
impatient
means
tat
iss
a
steep
rock
it
means
well
sir
is
ower
deep
for
ta
the
tone
of
mortification
in
which
duncan
uttered
these
words
warned
lavender
that
his
philological
studies
might
as
well
cease
and
indeed
sheila
and
ingram
had
by
this
time
reached
the
banks
of
the
white
water
and
were
waiting
duncan
and
his
majestic
rod
it
was
much
too
bright
and
pleasant
a
morning
for
good
fishing
but
there
was
a
fair
ripple
on
the
pools
of
the
stream
where
ever
and
anon
a
salmon
fresh
run
from
the
sea
would
leap
into
the
air
showing
a
gleaming
curve
of
silver
to
the
sunlight
the
splash
of
the
big
fish
seemed
an
invitation
and
duncan
was
all
anxiety
to
teach
the
stranger
who
as
he
fancied
knew
nothing
about
throwing
a
fly
ingram
lay
down
on
a
rock
some
little
distance
back
from
the
banks
and
put
his
hands
beneath
his
head
and
watched
the
operations
going
forward
but
was
it
really
duncan
who
was
to
teach
the
stranger
it
was
sheila
who
picked
out
flies
for
him
it
was
sheila
who
held
the
rod
while
he
put
them
on
the
line
it
was
sheila
who
told
where
the
bigger
salmon
usually
lay
under
the
opposite
bank
of
the
broad
and
almost
pool
into
which
the
small
but
rapid
white
water
came
tumbling
and
foaming
down
its
narrow
channel
of
rocks
and
stones
then
sheila
waited
to
see
her
pupil
begin
he
had
evidently
a
little
difficulty
about
the
big
rod
a
somewhat
more
formidable
engine
of
destruction
than
the
supple
little
thing
with
which
he
had
whipped
the
streams
of
devonshire
and
cornwall
the
first
cast
sent
both
flies
and
a
lump
of
line
tumbling
on
to
the
pool
and
would
have
driven
the
boldest
of
salmon
out
of
its
wits
the
second
pretty
nearly
took
a
piece
out
of
ear
and
made
him
shift
his
quarters
with
rapidity
duncan
gave
him
up
in
despair
the
third
cast
dropped
both
flies
with
the
lightness
of
a
feather
in
the
running
waters
of
the
other
side
of
the
pool
and
the
next
second
there
was
a
slight
wave
along
the
surface
a
dexterous
jerk
with
the
butt
and
presently
the
line
was
whirled
out
into
the
middle
of
the
pool
running
rapidly
off
the
reel
from
the
straining
rod
line
sir
plenty
line
shouted
duncan
in
a
wild
fever
of
anxiety
for
the
fish
had
plunged
suddenly
ingram
had
come
running
down
to
the
bank
sheila
was
all
excitement
and
interest
as
she
stood
and
watched
every
slackening
or
tightening
of
the
line
as
the
fish
went
up
the
pool
and
down
the
pool
and
crossed
the
current
in
his
efforts
to
escape
the
only
person
indeed
was
lavender
himself
who
presently
said
mackenzie
you
take
the
rod
now
and
have
the
honor
of
landing
him
i
think
he
will
show
much
more
at
this
moment
however
the
line
slackened
suddenly
and
the
fish
threw
himself
clean
out
of
the
water
turning
a
complete
somersault
it
was
a
dangerous
moment
but
the
captive
was
well
hooked
and
in
his
next
plunge
lavender
was
admonished
by
duncan
to
keep
a
good
strain
on
him
will
take
the
second
one
sheila
promised
you
like
but
you
must
surely
land
your
first
salmon
i
suppose
nobody
but
a
fisherman
can
understand
the
generosity
of
the
offer
made
by
the
young
man
to
have
hooked
your
first
salmon
to
have
its
first
wild
rushes
and
plunges
safely
over
and
to
offer
to
another
the
delight
of
bringing
him
victoriously
to
bank
but
sheila
knew
and
what
could
have
surpassed
the
cleverness
with
which
he
had
hooked
the
fish
and
the
coolness
and
courage
he
showed
throughout
the
playing
of
him
except
this
more
than
royal
offer
on
the
part
of
the
young
hero
the
fish
was
losing
strength
all
the
line
had
been
got
in
although
the
forefinger
of
the
fisherman
felt
the
pulse
of
his
captive
as
it
were
ready
for
any
expiring
plunge
they
caught
occasional
glimpses
of
a
large
white
body
gliding
through
the
water
duncan
was
down
on
his
knees
more
than
once
with
the
in
his
hand
but
again
and
again
the
big
fish
would
sheer
off
with
just
such
indications
of
power
as
to
make
his
conqueror
cautious
at
length
he
was
guided
slowly
in
to
the
bank
behind
him
the
was
gently
let
into
the
water
then
a
quick
forward
movement
and
a
fourteen
pounder
was
scooped
up
and
flung
upon
the
bank
and
all
cried
ingram
and
lavender
blushed
like
a
and
sheila
quite
naturally
and
without
thinking
shook
hands
with
him
and
said
congratulate
you
and
there
was
more
congratulation
in
her
glad
eyes
than
in
that
simple
little
gesture
it
was
a
good
beginning
and
of
course
the
young
man
was
very
much
pleased
to
show
sheila
that
he
was
no
mere
idler
about
town
he
buckled
to
his
work
in
earnest
with
a
few
more
casts
he
soon
got
into
the
way
of
managing
the
big
rod
and
every
time
the
flies
fell
lightly
on
the
other
side
of
the
pool
to
be
dragged
with
gentle
jerks
across
the
foaming
current
of
the
stream
ingram
went
back
to
his
couch
on
the
rock
he
lay
and
watched
the
monotonous
flinging
back
of
the
long
rod
the
light
whistle
of
the
line
through
the
air
and
the
careful
manipulation
of
the
flies
through
the
water
or
was
it
something
else
that
he
was
watching
something
that
awakened
in
his
mind
a
sudden
sense
of
surprise
and
fear
and
a
new
and
strange
consciousness
that
he
had
been
guiltily
remiss
sheila
was
wholly
with
her
companion
and
his
efforts
he
had
had
one
or
two
rises
but
had
struck
either
too
soon
or
too
late
until
at
last
there
was
a
terrific
plunge
and
rush
and
again
the
line
was
whirled
out
but
duncan
did
not
like
the
look
of
it
somehow
the
fish
had
been
sheering
off
when
it
was
hooked
and
the
deep
plunge
at
the
outset
was
ugly
will
you
take
the
rod
said
lavender
to
sheila
but
before
she
could
answer
the
fish
had
come
rushing
up
to
the
surface
and
had
thrown
itself
out
of
the
water
so
that
it
fell
on
the
opposite
bank
it
was
a
splendid
animal
and
duncan
despite
his
doubts
called
out
to
lavender
to
slacken
his
hold
there
was
another
spring
into
the
air
the
fish
fell
with
a
splash
into
the
water
and
the
line
was
flying
helplessly
into
the
air
with
the
two
flies
floating
about
said
duncan
with
a
sigh
wass
it
wass
no
chance
of
catching
him
lavender
was
most
successful
next
time
however
with
a
pretty
little
grilse
of
about
half
a
dozen
pounds
that
seemed
to
have
in
him
the
spirit
and
fight
of
a
dozen
salmon
how
he
rushed
and
struggled
how
he
plunged
and
sulked
how
he
burrowed
along
the
banks
and
then
ran
out
to
the
middle
of
the
pool
and
then
threw
himself
into
the
air
with
the
line
apparently
but
not
really
doubling
up
under
him
all
these
things
can
only
be
understood
by
the
fisherman
who
has
played
in
a
highland
stream
a
wild
and
powerful
little
grilse
fresh
in
from
the
salt
water
and
it
was
sheila
who
held
him
captive
who
humored
him
when
he
sulked
and
gently
guided
him
away
from
dangerous
places
and
kept
him
well
in
hand
when
he
tried
to
cross
the
current
until
at
last
all
the
fierceness
gone
out
of
him
he
let
himself
be
tenderly
inveigled
into
the
side
of
the
pool
where
duncan
by
a
dexterous
movement
surrounded
him
with
network
and
placed
his
shining
body
among
the
bright
green
grass
but
ingram
was
not
so
overjoyed
this
time
he
complimented
sheila
in
a
friendly
way
but
he
was
rather
grave
and
obviously
did
not
care
for
this
business
of
fishing
and
so
sheila
fancying
that
he
was
rather
dull
because
he
was
not
joining
in
the
sport
proposed
that
he
should
walk
back
to
the
house
with
her
leaving
mr
lavender
with
duncan
and
ingram
was
quite
ready
to
do
so
but
lavender
protested
that
he
cared
very
little
for
he
suggested
that
they
should
all
go
back
together
the
sun
was
killing
the
wind
and
soon
the
pools
would
be
as
clear
as
glass
had
they
not
better
try
in
the
afternoon
when
perhaps
the
breeze
would
freshen
and
so
they
walked
back
to
the
house
on
the
a
book
lay
open
it
was
on
liberty
and
it
had
evidently
been
left
there
by
mackenzie
perhaps
who
knows
to
hint
to
his
friends
from
the
south
that
he
was
familiar
with
the
problems
of
the
age
lavender
winked
to
ingram
but
somehow
his
companion
seemed
in
no
humor
for
a
joke
they
had
luncheon
then
and
after
luncheon
ingram
touched
lavender
on
the
shoulder
and
said
want
to
have
a
word
with
you
privately
walk
down
to
the
and
so
they
did
and
when
they
had
got
some
little
distance
from
the
house
ingram
said
here
lavender
i
mean
to
be
frank
with
you
i
think
it
fair
that
you
should
try
to
drag
sheila
mackenzie
into
a
flirtation
i
knew
you
would
fall
in
love
with
her
for
a
week
or
two
that
does
not
matter
it
harms
no
one
but
i
never
thought
of
the
chance
of
her
being
led
into
such
a
thing
for
what
is
a
mere
passing
amusement
to
you
would
be
a
very
serious
thing
to
is
not
that
enough
do
you
think
it
fair
to
take
advantage
of
this
innocence
of
the
world
lavender
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
path
and
said
somewhat
stiffly
may
be
as
well
settled
at
once
you
have
talked
of
flirtation
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
may
regard
it
as
you
please
but
before
i
leave
this
island
i
mean
to
ask
sheila
mackenzie
to
be
my
you
are
mad
cried
ingram
amazed
to
see
that
the
young
man
was
perfectly
serious
the
other
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
mean
to
say
continued
ingram
even
supposing
sheila
would
consent
which
is
impossible
you
would
try
to
take
away
that
girl
from
her
father
must
leave
their
fathers
sometime
or
other
said
lavender
somewhat
sullenly
unless
they
are
well
they
are
sure
to
be
asked
and
they
are
sure
to
go
if
their
mothers
had
not
done
so
before
them
where
would
they
be
all
very
well
for
you
to
talk
about
it
and
argue
it
out
as
a
theory
but
i
know
what
the
facts
of
the
case
are
and
what
any
man
in
my
position
would
do
and
i
know
that
i
am
careless
of
any
consequences
so
long
as
i
can
secure
her
for
my
you
are
careless
of
any
consequences
to
herself
or
those
about
what
is
your
objection
ingram
said
the
young
man
suddenly
abandoning
his
defiant
manner
should
you
object
do
you
think
i
would
make
a
bad
husband
to
the
woman
i
married
believe
nothing
of
the
sort
i
believe
you
would
make
a
very
good
husband
if
you
were
to
marry
a
woman
whom
you
know
something
about
and
whom
you
had
really
learned
to
love
and
respect
through
your
knowledge
of
her
i
tell
you
you
know
nothing
about
sheila
mackenzie
as
yet
if
you
were
to
marry
her
you
would
discover
in
six
months
she
was
a
woman
wholly
different
from
what
you
had
well
then
said
lavender
with
an
air
of
triumph
deny
this
you
think
so
much
of
her
that
the
real
woman
i
would
discover
must
be
better
than
the
one
i
imagine
and
so
you
expect
i
shall
be
disappointed
you
marry
sheila
mackenzie
you
will
be
disappointed
not
through
her
fault
but
your
own
why
a
more
preposterous
notion
never
entered
a
head
she
knows
nothing
of
your
friends
or
your
ways
of
life
you
know
nothing
of
hers
she
would
be
miserable
in
london
even
if
you
could
persuade
her
father
to
go
with
her
which
is
the
most
unlikely
thing
in
the
world
do
give
up
this
foolish
idea
like
a
good
fellow
and
do
it
before
sheila
is
dragged
into
a
flirtation
that
may
have
the
most
serious
consequences
to
lavender
would
not
promise
but
all
that
afternoon
various
resolutions
and
emotions
were
struggling
within
him
for
mastery
insomuch
that
duncan
could
not
understand
the
blundering
way
in
which
he
whipped
the
pools
mackenzie
sheila
and
ingram
had
gone
off
to
pay
a
visit
to
an
old
crone
who
lived
in
a
neighboring
island
and
in
whom
ingram
had
been
much
interested
a
few
years
before
so
that
lavender
had
an
opportunity
of
practicing
the
art
of
without
interruptions
but
all
the
skill
he
had
shown
in
the
morning
seemed
to
have
deserted
him
and
at
last
he
gave
the
rod
to
duncan
and
sitting
down
on
a
flung
on
the
wet
heather
indolently
watched
the
operations
should
he
at
once
fly
from
temptation
and
return
to
london
would
it
not
be
heroic
to
leave
this
old
man
in
possession
of
his
only
daughter
sheila
would
never
know
of
the
sacrifice
but
what
of
that
it
might
be
for
her
happiness
that
he
should
go
but
when
a
young
man
is
in
love
or
fancies
himself
in
love
with
a
young
girl
it
is
hard
for
him
to
persuade
himself
that
anybody
else
can
make
her
as
happy
as
he
might
who
could
be
so
tender
to
her
so
watchful
over
her
as
himself
he
does
not
reflect
that
her
parents
have
had
the
experience
of
years
in
taking
care
of
her
while
he
would
be
a
mere
novice
at
the
business
the
pleasure
with
which
he
regards
the
prospect
of
being
constantly
with
her
he
transfers
to
her
and
she
seems
to
demand
it
of
him
as
a
duty
that
he
should
confer
upon
her
this
new
happiness
lavender
met
sheila
in
the
evening
and
he
was
yet
undecided
sometimes
he
fancied
when
their
eyes
met
unexpectedly
that
there
was
something
wistful
as
well
as
friendly
in
her
look
was
she
too
dreaming
of
the
vague
possibilities
of
the
future
this
was
strange
too
that
after
each
of
these
little
chance
reveries
she
seemed
to
be
moved
by
a
resolution
to
be
more
than
usually
affectionate
toward
her
father
and
would
go
around
the
table
and
place
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
talk
to
him
perhaps
these
things
were
but
delusions
begotten
of
his
own
imaginings
but
the
possibility
of
their
being
real
agitated
him
not
a
little
and
he
scarcely
dared
to
think
what
might
follow
that
evening
sheila
sang
and
all
his
resolutions
vanished
into
air
he
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
curious
and
chamber
and
lying
back
in
the
chair
abandoned
himself
to
dreams
as
sheila
sang
the
mystic
songs
of
the
northern
coast
there
was
something
strangely
suggestive
of
the
sea
in
the
room
itself
and
all
her
songs
were
of
the
sea
it
was
a
smaller
room
than
the
large
apartment
in
which
they
had
dined
and
it
was
filled
with
curiosities
from
distant
shores
and
with
the
strange
captures
made
by
the
borva
fishermen
everywhere
too
were
the
trophies
of
skill
with
rod
and
rifle
horns
seal
skins
stuffed
birds
salmon
in
glass
cases
masses
of
coral
enormous
shells
and
a
thousand
similar
things
made
the
little
a
sort
of
grotto
but
it
was
a
grotto
within
hearing
of
the
sound
of
the
sea
and
there
was
no
musty
atmosphere
in
a
room
that
was
open
all
day
to
the
cold
winds
of
the
atlantic
with
a
smoking
tumbler
of
whisky
and
water
before
him
the
king
of
borva
sat
at
the
table
poring
over
a
large
volume
containing
plans
for
bridges
ingram
was
seated
at
the
piano
in
continual
consultation
with
sheila
about
her
songs
lavender
in
the
dusky
corner
lay
and
listened
with
all
sorts
of
fancies
crowding
in
upon
him
as
sheila
sang
of
the
sad
and
wild
legends
of
her
home
was
it
by
chance
then
he
asked
himself
that
these
songs
seemed
so
frequently
to
be
the
lamentation
of
a
highland
girl
for
a
lover
beyond
the
sea
first
of
all
she
sang
the
of
dunevegan
and
how
strangely
her
voice
thrilled
with
the
sadness
of
the
song
morn
oh
mantle
thy
smiles
of
gladness
night
oh
come
with
thy
clouds
of
sadness
earth
thy
pleasures
to
me
seem
madness
macleod
my
leal
love
since
thou
art
gone
dunevegan
oh
dunevegan
oh
dunevegan
dunevegan
it
was
as
in
a
dream
that
he
heard
ingram
talking
in
a
way
about
the
airs
and
asking
the
meaning
of
certain
lines
of
gaelic
to
compare
them
with
the
stiff
and
phrases
of
the
translation
surely
this
girl
must
have
sat
by
the
shore
and
waited
for
her
absent
lover
or
how
could
she
sing
with
such
feeling
say
my
love
why
didst
thou
tarry
far
over
the
deep
sea
thou
not
my
heart
was
weary
thou
not
how
i
sighed
for
thee
did
no
light
wind
bear
my
wild
despair
far
over
the
deep
sea
he
could
imagine
that
beautiful
face
grown
pale
and
wild
with
anguish
and
then
some
day
as
she
went
along
the
lonely
island
with
all
the
light
of
hope
gone
out
of
her
eyes
and
with
no
more
wistful
glances
cast
across
the
desolate
sea
might
not
the
lover
come
at
last
and
leap
ashore
to
clasp
her
in
his
arms
and
hide
the
eyes
and
the
glad
face
in
his
bosom
but
sheila
sang
of
no
such
meeting
the
girl
was
always
alone
her
lover
gone
away
from
her
across
the
sea
or
into
the
wilds
oh
long
on
the
mountain
he
tarries
he
tarries
why
tarries
the
youth
with
the
bright
yellow
hair
oh
long
on
the
mountain
he
tarries
he
tarries
why
seeks
he
the
hill
when
his
flock
is
not
there
that
was
what
he
heard
her
sing
until
it
seemed
to
him
that
her
singing
was
a
cry
to
be
taken
away
from
these
melancholy
surroundings
of
sea
and
shore
and
carried
to
the
secure
and
comfortable
south
to
be
cherished
and
tended
and
loved
why
should
this
girl
be
left
to
live
a
cruel
life
up
in
these
wilds
and
to
go
through
this
world
without
knowing
anything
of
the
happy
existence
that
might
have
been
hers
it
was
well
for
harder
and
stronger
natures
to
withstand
the
buffetings
of
wind
and
rain
and
be
indifferent
to
the
melancholy
influences
of
the
lonely
sea
and
the
darkness
of
the
northern
winters
but
for
her
for
this
beautiful
sensitive
girl
surely
some
other
and
gentler
fate
was
in
store
what
he
at
least
could
do
he
would
he
would
lay
his
life
at
her
feet
and
if
she
chose
to
go
away
from
this
bleak
and
cruel
home
to
the
sunnier
south
would
not
he
devote
himself
as
never
a
man
had
given
himself
to
a
woman
before
to
the
constant
duty
of
enriching
her
life
with
all
the
treasures
of
admiration
and
respect
and
love
it
was
getting
late
and
sheila
retired
as
she
bade
to
him
lavender
fancied
her
manner
was
a
little
less
frank
toward
him
than
usual
and
her
eyes
were
cast
down
all
the
light
of
the
room
seemed
to
go
with
her
when
she
went
mackenzie
mixed
another
tumbler
of
toddy
and
began
to
expound
to
ingram
his
views
upon
and
ingram
lit
a
cigar
stretched
out
his
legs
and
proceeded
to
listen
with
much
complacent
attention
as
for
lavender
he
sat
awhile
hearing
vaguely
the
sounds
of
his
voices
and
then
saying
he
was
a
trifle
tired
he
left
and
went
to
his
own
room
the
moon
was
then
clearly
shining
over
suainabhal
and
a
pathway
of
glimmering
light
lay
across
loch
roag
he
went
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
he
had
resolved
to
ask
sheila
mackenzie
to
be
his
wife
and
a
thousand
conjectures
as
to
the
future
were
floating
about
his
imagination
in
the
first
place
would
she
listen
to
his
prayer
she
knew
nothing
of
him
beyond
what
she
might
have
heard
from
ingram
he
had
had
no
opportunity
during
their
friendly
talking
of
revealing
to
her
what
he
thought
of
herself
but
might
she
not
have
guessed
it
then
her
father
what
action
might
not
this
determined
old
man
take
in
the
matter
would
his
love
for
his
daughter
prompt
him
to
consider
her
happiness
alone
all
these
things
however
were
mere
preliminaries
and
the
imagination
of
the
young
man
soon
overleapt
them
he
began
to
draw
pictures
of
sheila
as
his
wife
in
their
london
home
among
his
friends
at
hastings
at
ascot
in
hyde
park
what
would
people
say
of
the
beautiful
with
the
proud
air
the
fearless
eye
and
the
gentle
and
musical
voice
hour
after
hour
he
lay
and
could
not
sleep
a
fever
of
anticipation
of
fear
and
hope
combined
seemed
to
stir
in
his
blood
and
throb
in
his
brain
at
last
in
a
paroxysm
of
unrest
he
rose
hastily
dressed
himself
stole
down
stairs
and
made
his
way
out
into
the
cool
air
of
the
night
it
could
not
be
the
coming
dawn
that
revealed
to
him
the
outlines
of
the
shore
and
the
mountains
and
the
loch
the
moon
had
already
sunk
in
the
southwest
not
from
her
came
that
strange
clearness
by
which
all
these
objects
were
defined
then
the
young
man
bethought
him
of
what
sheila
had
said
of
the
twilight
in
these
latitudes
and
turning
to
the
north
he
saw
there
a
pale
glow
which
looked
as
if
it
were
the
last
faint
traces
of
some
former
sunset
all
over
the
rest
of
the
heavens
something
of
the
same
metallic
clearness
reigned
so
that
the
stars
were
pale
and
a
gray
hue
lay
over
the
sea
and
over
the
island
the
white
bays
the
black
rocks
and
the
valleys
in
which
lay
a
scarcely
perceptible
mist
he
left
the
house
and
went
vaguely
down
to
the
sea
the
cold
air
scented
strongly
with
the
seaweed
blew
about
him
and
was
sweet
and
fresh
on
the
lips
and
the
forehead
how
strange
was
the
monotonous
sound
of
the
waves
mournful
and
distant
like
the
sound
in
a
that
alone
spoke
in
the
awful
stillness
of
the
night
and
it
seemed
to
be
telling
of
those
things
which
the
silent
stars
and
the
silent
hills
had
looked
down
on
for
ages
and
ages
did
sheila
really
love
this
terrible
thing
with
its
strange
voice
talking
in
the
night
or
did
she
not
secretly
dread
it
and
shudder
at
it
when
she
sang
of
all
that
old
sadness
there
was
ringing
in
his
ears
the
of
as
he
listened
for
a
while
to
the
melancholy
plashing
of
the
waves
all
around
the
lonely
shores
and
there
was
a
cry
of
oh
dunevegan
oh
weaving
itself
curiously
with
those
wild
pictures
of
sheila
in
london
which
were
still
floating
before
his
imagination
he
walked
away
around
the
coast
seeing
almost
nothing
of
the
objects
around
him
but
conscious
of
the
solemn
majesty
of
the
mountains
and
the
stillness
of
the
throbbing
stars
he
could
have
called
aloud
sheila
but
that
all
the
place
seemed
associated
with
her
presence
and
might
he
not
turn
suddenly
to
find
her
figure
standing
by
him
with
her
face
grown
wild
and
pale
as
it
was
in
the
ballad
and
a
piteous
and
awful
look
in
her
eyes
he
scarcely
dared
look
around
lest
there
should
be
a
phantom
sheila
appealing
to
him
for
compassion
and
complaining
against
him
with
her
speechless
eyes
for
a
wrong
that
he
could
not
understand
he
fled
from
her
but
he
knew
that
she
was
there
and
all
the
love
in
his
heart
went
out
to
her
as
if
beseeching
her
to
go
away
and
forsake
him
and
forgive
him
the
injury
of
which
she
seemed
to
accuse
him
what
wrong
had
he
done
her
that
he
should
be
haunted
by
this
spectre
that
did
not
threaten
but
only
looked
piteously
toward
him
with
eyes
full
of
entreaty
and
pain
he
left
the
shore
and
blindly
made
his
way
up
to
the
above
careless
whither
he
went
he
knew
not
how
long
he
had
been
away
from
the
house
but
here
was
a
small
lake
set
around
about
with
rushes
and
far
over
there
in
the
east
lay
a
glimmer
of
the
channels
between
borva
and
lewis
but
soon
there
was
another
light
in
the
east
high
over
the
low
mists
that
lay
along
the
land
a
pale
arose
in
the
cloudless
sky
and
the
stars
went
out
one
by
one
the
mists
were
seen
to
lie
in
thicker
folds
along
the
desolate
valleys
then
a
faintly
stole
up
into
the
sky
and
broadened
and
widened
and
behold
the
little
moorland
loch
caught
a
reflection
of
the
glare
and
there
was
a
streak
of
crimson
here
and
there
on
the
surface
of
the
water
loch
roag
began
to
brighten
suainabhal
was
touched
with
on
its
eastern
slopes
the
atlantic
seemed
to
rise
out
of
its
purple
sleep
with
the
new
light
of
a
new
dawn
and
then
there
was
a
chirruping
of
birds
over
the
heath
and
the
first
shafts
of
the
sunlight
ran
along
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
lit
up
the
white
wavelets
that
were
breaking
on
the
beach
the
new
day
struck
upon
him
with
a
strange
sense
of
wonder
where
was
he
whither
had
gone
the
wild
visions
of
the
night
the
feverish
dread
the
horrible
forebodings
the
strong
mental
emotion
that
had
driven
him
out
now
produced
its
natural
reaction
he
looked
about
in
a
dazed
fashion
at
the
revelation
of
light
around
him
and
felt
himself
trembling
with
weakness
slowly
blindly
and
hopelessly
he
set
to
walk
back
across
the
island
with
the
sunlight
of
the
fresh
morning
calling
into
life
ten
thousand
audible
things
of
the
moorland
around
him
and
who
was
this
that
stood
at
the
porch
of
the
house
in
the
clear
sunshine
not
the
pale
and
ghastly
creature
who
had
haunted
him
during
those
wild
hours
but
sheila
herself
singing
some
snatches
of
a
song
and
engaged
in
watering
the
two
bushes
of
at
the
gate
how
bright
and
roseate
and
happy
she
looked
with
the
fine
color
of
her
face
lit
up
by
the
fresh
sunlight
and
the
brisk
breeze
from
the
sea
stirring
now
and
again
the
loose
masses
of
her
hair
haggard
and
faint
as
he
was
he
would
have
startled
her
if
he
had
gone
up
to
her
then
he
dared
not
approach
her
he
waited
until
she
had
gone
around
to
the
gable
of
the
house
to
water
the
plants
there
and
then
he
stole
into
the
house
and
upstairs
and
threw
himself
upon
the
bed
and
outside
he
still
heard
sheila
singing
lightly
to
herself
as
she
went
about
her
ordinary
duties
little
thinking
in
how
strange
and
wild
a
drama
her
wraith
had
that
night
taken
part
part
iii
chapter
vi
at
barvas
bridge
very
soon
indeed
ingram
began
to
see
that
his
friend
had
spoken
to
him
quite
frankly
and
that
he
was
really
bent
on
asking
sheila
to
become
his
wife
ingram
contemplated
this
prospect
with
some
dismay
and
with
some
vague
consciousness
that
he
was
himself
responsible
for
what
he
could
not
help
regarding
as
a
disaster
he
had
half
expected
that
frank
lavender
would
in
his
ordinary
fashion
fall
in
love
with
sheila
for
about
a
fortnight
he
had
joked
him
about
it
even
before
they
came
within
sight
of
home
he
had
listened
with
a
grim
humor
to
outbursts
of
admiration
and
only
asked
himself
how
many
times
he
had
heard
the
same
phrases
before
but
now
things
were
looking
more
serious
for
the
young
man
had
thrown
himself
into
the
prosecution
of
his
new
project
with
all
the
generous
poetic
enthusiasm
of
a
highly
impulsive
nature
ingram
saw
that
everything
a
young
man
could
do
to
win
the
heart
of
a
young
girl
lavender
would
do
and
nature
had
dowered
him
richly
with
various
means
of
fascination
most
dangerous
of
all
of
these
was
a
gift
of
sincerity
that
deceived
himself
he
could
assume
an
opinion
or
express
an
emotion
at
will
with
such
genuine
fervor
that
he
himself
forgot
how
recently
he
had
acquired
it
and
was
able
to
convince
his
companion
for
the
moment
that
it
was
a
revelation
of
his
inmost
soul
it
was
this
charm
of
impetuous
sincerity
which
had
fascinated
ingram
himself
years
before
and
made
him
cultivate
the
acquaintance
of
a
young
man
whom
he
at
first
regarded
as
a
somewhat
facile
talkative
and
histrionic
person
ingram
perceived
for
example
that
young
lavender
had
so
little
regard
for
public
affairs
that
he
would
have
been
quite
content
to
see
our
indian
empire
go
for
the
sake
of
eliciting
a
sarcasm
from
lord
westbury
but
at
the
same
time
if
you
had
appealed
to
his
nobler
instincts
and
placed
before
him
the
condition
of
a
certain
populace
suffering
from
starvation
he
would
have
done
all
in
his
power
to
aid
them
he
would
have
written
letters
to
the
newspapers
would
have
headed
subscriptions
and
would
have
ended
by
believing
that
he
had
been
the
constant
friend
of
the
people
of
india
throughout
his
life
and
was
bound
to
stick
to
them
to
the
end
of
it
as
often
as
not
he
borrowed
his
fancies
and
opinions
from
edward
ingram
himself
who
was
amused
and
gratified
at
the
same
time
to
find
his
humdrum
notions
receive
a
dozen
new
lights
and
colors
when
transferred
to
the
warmer
atmosphere
of
his
imagination
ingram
would
even
consent
to
receive
from
his
younger
companion
advice
impetuously
urged
and
richly
illustrated
which
he
had
himself
offered
in
similar
terms
months
before
at
this
very
moment
he
could
see
that
much
of
romantic
conceptions
of
character
was
only
an
exaggeration
of
some
passing
hints
he
ingram
had
dropped
as
the
clansman
was
steaming
into
stornoway
but
then
they
were
ever
so
much
more
beautiful
ingram
held
to
his
conviction
that
he
himself
was
a
distinctly
commonplace
person
he
had
grown
reconciled
to
the
ordinary
grooves
of
life
but
young
lavender
was
not
commonplace
he
fancied
he
could
see
in
him
an
occasional
flash
of
something
that
looked
like
genius
and
many
and
many
a
time
in
regarding
the
brilliant
and
facile
powers
the
generous
impulses
and
the
occasional
ambitions
of
his
companion
he
wondered
whether
these
would
ever
lead
to
anything
in
the
way
of
production
or
even
of
consideration
of
character
or
whether
they
would
merely
remain
the
passing
sensations
of
an
indifferent
idler
sometimes
indeed
he
devoutly
wished
that
lavender
had
been
born
a
stonemason
but
all
these
pleasant
and
graceful
qualities
which
had
made
the
young
man
an
agreeable
companion
were
a
serious
danger
now
for
was
it
not
but
too
probable
that
sheila
accustomed
to
the
rude
and
homely
ways
of
the
islanders
would
be
attracted
and
pleased
and
fascinated
by
one
who
had
about
him
so
much
of
a
soft
and
southern
brightness
with
which
she
was
wholly
unfamiliar
this
frankness
of
his
placed
all
his
best
qualities
in
the
sunshine
as
it
were
she
could
not
fail
to
see
the
singular
modesty
and
courtesy
of
his
bearing
towards
women
his
gentle
manners
his
his
passionate
admiration
of
the
of
others
and
his
sympathy
with
their
sufferings
ingram
would
not
have
minded
much
if
lavender
alone
had
been
concerned
in
the
dilemma
now
growing
imminent
he
would
have
left
him
to
flounder
out
as
he
had
got
out
of
previous
ones
but
he
had
been
surprised
and
pained
and
even
frightened
to
detect
in
manner
some
faint
indications
so
faint
that
he
was
doubtful
what
construction
to
put
on
them
of
a
special
interest
in
the
young
stranger
whom
he
had
brought
with
him
to
borva
what
could
he
do
in
the
matter
supposing
his
suspicions
were
correct
caution
sheila
it
would
be
an
insult
warn
mackenzie
the
king
of
borva
would
fly
into
passion
with
everybody
concerned
and
bring
endless
humiliation
on
his
daughter
who
had
probably
never
dreamed
of
regarding
lavender
except
as
a
chance
acquaintance
insist
upon
lavender
going
south
at
once
that
would
merely
goad
the
young
man
into
obstinacy
ingram
found
himself
in
a
grievous
difficulty
afraid
to
say
how
much
of
it
was
of
his
own
creation
he
had
no
selfish
sentiments
of
his
own
to
consult
if
it
were
to
become
evident
that
the
happiness
of
sheila
and
of
his
friend
depended
on
their
marrying
each
other
he
was
ready
to
forward
such
a
project
with
all
the
influence
at
his
command
but
there
were
a
hundred
reasons
why
he
should
dread
such
a
marriage
he
had
already
mentioned
several
of
them
to
lavender
in
trying
to
dissuade
the
young
man
from
his
purpose
a
few
days
had
passed
since
then
and
it
was
clear
that
lavender
had
abandoned
all
notion
of
fulfilling
those
resolutions
he
had
vaguely
formed
but
the
more
ingram
thought
over
the
matter
and
the
further
he
recalled
the
ancient
proverbs
and
stories
about
the
fate
of
intermeddlers
the
more
evident
it
became
to
him
that
he
could
take
no
immediate
action
in
the
affair
he
would
trust
to
the
chapter
of
accidents
to
save
sheila
from
what
he
considered
a
disastrous
fate
perhaps
lavender
would
repent
perhaps
mackenzie
continually
on
the
watch
for
small
secrets
would
discover
something
and
bid
his
daughter
stay
in
borva
while
his
guests
proceeded
on
their
tour
through
lewis
in
any
case
it
was
not
all
certain
that
lavender
would
be
successful
in
his
suit
was
the
heart
of
a
intelligent
and
girl
to
be
won
in
a
matter
of
three
weeks
or
a
month
lavender
would
go
south
and
no
more
would
be
heard
of
it
this
tour
around
the
island
of
lewis
however
was
not
likely
to
favor
much
any
such
easy
escape
from
the
difficulty
on
a
certain
morning
the
larger
of
boats
carried
the
holiday
party
away
from
borva
and
even
at
this
early
stage
as
they
sat
at
the
stern
of
the
heavy
craft
lavender
had
arrogated
to
himself
the
exclusive
right
of
waiting
upon
sheila
he
had
constituted
himself
her
companion
in
all
their
excursions
about
borva
which
they
had
undertaken
and
now
on
this
longer
journey
they
were
to
be
once
more
thrown
together
it
did
seem
a
little
hard
that
ingram
should
be
relegated
to
mackenzie
and
his
theories
of
government
but
did
he
not
profess
to
prefer
that
like
most
men
who
have
got
beyond
he
was
rather
proud
of
considering
himself
an
observer
of
life
he
stood
aside
as
a
spectator
and
let
other
people
engaged
in
all
manner
of
eager
pursuits
pass
before
him
for
review
toward
young
folks
indeed
he
assumed
a
paternal
air
as
if
they
were
but
as
children
to
be
humored
were
not
their
love
affairs
a
pretty
spectacle
as
for
himself
he
was
far
beyond
all
that
the
illusions
of
the
devotion
and
ambition
and
dreams
of
courtship
were
no
longer
possible
to
him
but
did
they
not
constitute
on
the
whole
a
beautiful
and
charming
study
that
had
about
it
at
times
some
little
touches
of
pathos
at
odd
moments
when
he
saw
sheila
and
lavender
walking
together
in
the
evening
he
was
himself
half
inclined
to
wish
that
something
might
come
of
the
young
determination
it
would
be
so
pleasant
to
play
the
part
of
a
friendly
counselor
to
humor
the
follies
of
the
young
folks
to
make
jokes
at
their
expense
and
then
in
the
midst
of
their
embarrassment
and
resentment
to
go
forward
and
pet
them
a
little
and
assure
them
of
a
real
and
earnest
sympathy
time
is
to
come
lavender
said
to
him
suddenly
after
he
had
been
exhibiting
some
of
his
paternal
forbearance
and
consideration
will
get
a
dreadful
twist
some
day
my
boy
you
have
been
doing
nothing
but
dreaming
about
women
but
some
day
or
other
you
will
wake
up
and
find
yourself
captured
and
fascinated
beyond
anything
you
have
ever
seen
in
other
people
and
then
you
will
discover
what
a
desperately
real
thing
it
ingram
had
a
misty
impression
that
he
had
heard
something
like
this
before
had
he
not
given
lavender
some
warning
of
the
same
kind
but
he
was
so
much
accustomed
to
hear
those
vague
repetitions
of
his
own
remarks
and
was
on
the
whole
so
well
pleased
to
think
that
his
commonplace
notions
should
take
root
and
flourish
in
this
goodly
soil
that
he
never
thought
of
asking
lavender
to
quote
his
authority
for
those
profound
observations
on
men
and
things
miss
mackenzie
said
the
young
man
as
the
big
boat
was
drawing
near
to
callernish
is
to
be
our
first
sketch
in
lewis
callernish
stones
of
course
said
mackenzie
himself
iss
more
than
one
hass
come
to
the
lewis
to
see
the
callernish
lavender
had
promised
to
the
king
of
borva
a
series
of
drawings
of
lewis
and
sheila
was
to
choose
the
subjects
from
day
to
day
mackenzie
was
gratified
by
this
proposal
and
accepted
it
with
much
magnanimity
but
sheila
knew
that
before
the
offer
was
made
lavender
had
come
to
her
and
asked
her
if
she
cared
about
sketches
and
whether
he
might
be
allowed
to
take
a
few
on
this
journey
and
present
them
to
her
she
was
very
grateful
but
suggested
that
it
might
please
her
papa
if
they
were
given
to
him
would
she
superintend
them
then
and
choose
the
topics
for
illustration
yes
she
would
do
that
and
so
the
young
man
was
furnished
with
a
roving
commission
he
brought
her
a
little
sepia
sketch
of
borvapost
its
huts
its
bay
and
its
upturned
boats
on
the
beach
expressions
of
praise
the
admiration
and
pleasure
that
shone
in
her
eyes
would
have
turned
any
young
head
but
her
papa
looked
at
the
picture
with
a
critical
eye
and
remarked
yes
it
is
ferry
good
but
is
not
the
color
of
loch
roag
at
all
it
is
the
color
of
a
river
where
there
is
a
flood
of
rain
i
have
neffer
at
all
seen
loch
roag
a
brown
color
neffer
at
it
was
clear
then
that
the
subsequent
sketches
could
not
be
taken
in
sepia
and
so
lavender
proposed
to
make
a
series
of
which
could
be
washed
in
with
color
afterward
there
was
one
subject
indeed
which
since
his
arrival
in
lewis
he
had
tried
to
fix
on
paper
by
every
conceivable
means
in
his
power
and
that
was
sheila
herself
he
had
spoiled
innumerable
sheets
of
paper
in
trying
to
get
some
likeness
of
her
which
would
satisfy
himself
but
all
his
usual
skill
seemed
somehow
to
have
gone
from
him
he
could
not
understand
it
in
ordinary
circumstances
he
could
have
traced
in
a
dozen
lines
a
portrait
that
would
at
least
have
shown
a
superficial
likeness
he
could
have
multiplied
portraits
by
the
dozen
of
old
mackenzie
or
ingram
or
duncan
but
here
he
seemed
to
fail
utterly
he
invited
no
criticism
certainly
these
efforts
were
made
in
his
own
room
and
he
asked
no
opinion
as
to
the
likeness
he
could
indeed
certify
to
himself
that
the
drawing
of
the
features
was
correct
enough
there
was
the
sweet
and
placid
forehead
with
its
low
masses
of
dark
hair
there
the
short
upper
lip
the
finely
carved
mouth
the
chin
and
throat
and
there
the
frank
clear
proud
eyes
with
their
long
lashes
and
eyebrows
sometimes
too
a
touch
of
color
added
warmth
to
the
complexion
put
a
glimmer
of
the
blue
sea
beneath
the
long
black
eyelashes
and
drew
a
thread
of
scarlet
around
the
white
neck
but
was
this
sheila
could
he
take
this
sheet
of
paper
to
his
friends
in
london
and
say
here
is
the
magical
princess
whom
i
hope
to
bring
to
you
from
the
north
with
all
the
glamour
of
the
sea
around
her
he
felt
instinctively
that
there
would
be
an
awkward
pause
the
people
would
praise
the
handsome
frank
courageous
head
and
look
upon
the
bit
of
red
ribbon
around
the
neck
as
an
effective
artistic
touch
they
would
hand
him
back
the
paper
with
a
compliment
and
he
would
find
himself
in
an
agony
of
unrest
because
they
had
misunderstood
the
portrait
and
seen
nothing
of
the
wonder
that
encompassed
this
highland
girl
as
if
with
a
garment
of
mystery
and
dreams
so
he
tore
up
portrait
after
portrait
more
than
one
of
which
would
have
startled
ingram
by
its
truth
and
then
to
prove
to
himself
that
he
was
not
growing
mad
he
resolved
to
try
a
portrait
of
some
other
person
he
drew
a
head
of
old
mackenzie
in
chalk
and
was
amazed
at
the
rapidity
and
facility
with
which
he
executed
the
task
then
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
success
of
the
likeness
nor
as
to
the
effect
of
the
picture
the
king
of
borva
with
his
heavy
eyebrows
his
aquiline
nose
his
keen
gray
eyes
and
flowing
beard
offered
a
fine
subject
and
there
was
something
really
royal
and
massive
and
noble
in
the
head
that
lavender
well
satisfied
with
his
work
took
down
stairs
one
evening
sheila
was
alone
in
the
turning
over
some
music
mackenzie
he
said
rather
kindly
you
look
at
this
sheila
turned
around
and
the
sudden
light
of
pleasure
that
leapt
to
her
face
was
all
the
praise
and
all
the
assurance
he
wanted
but
he
had
more
than
that
the
girl
was
grateful
to
him
beyond
all
the
words
she
could
utter
and
when
he
asked
her
if
she
would
accept
the
picture
she
thanked
him
by
taking
his
hand
for
a
moment
and
then
she
left
the
room
to
call
in
ingram
and
her
father
all
the
evening
there
was
a
singular
look
of
happiness
on
her
face
when
she
met
eyes
with
hers
there
was
a
frank
and
friendly
look
of
gratitude
ready
to
reward
him
when
had
he
earned
so
much
before
by
a
simple
sketch
many
and
many
a
portrait
carefully
executed
and
elaborately
framed
had
he
presented
to
his
lady
friends
in
london
to
receive
from
them
a
pretty
note
and
a
few
words
of
thanks
when
next
he
called
here
with
a
rough
chalk
sketch
he
had
awakened
an
amount
of
gratitude
that
almost
surprised
him
in
the
most
beautiful
and
tender
soul
in
this
world
and
had
not
this
princess
among
women
taken
his
hand
for
a
moment
as
a
childlike
way
of
expressing
her
thanks
while
her
eyes
spoke
more
than
her
lips
and
the
more
he
looked
at
those
eyes
the
more
he
grew
to
despair
of
ever
being
able
to
put
down
the
magic
of
them
in
lines
and
colors
at
length
duncan
got
the
boat
into
the
small
creek
at
callernish
and
the
party
got
out
on
the
shore
as
they
were
going
up
the
steep
path
leading
to
the
plain
above
a
young
girl
met
them
who
looked
at
them
in
rather
a
strange
way
she
had
a
fair
pretty
wondering
face
with
singularly
high
eyebrows
and
clear
light
blue
eyes
are
you
eily
said
mackenzie
as
he
passed
on
with
ingram
but
sheila
on
making
the
same
inquiry
shook
hands
with
the
girl
who
smiled
in
a
confidential
way
and
coming
quite
close
nodded
and
pointed
down
to
the
edge
you
seen
them
eily
said
sheila
still
holding
the
girl
by
the
hands
and
looking
at
the
fair
pretty
strange
face
wass
sa
day
before
yesterday
she
answered
in
a
whisper
while
a
pleased
smile
appeared
on
her
face
sey
will
be
here
sa
eily
take
care
you
stay
out
at
night
and
catch
cold
you
know
said
sheila
and
then
with
another
little
nod
and
a
smile
the
young
girl
went
down
the
path
is
eily
as
they
call
her
said
sheila
to
lavender
as
they
went
on
poor
thing
fancies
she
sees
little
people
about
the
rocks
and
watches
for
them
but
she
is
very
good
and
quiet
and
she
is
not
afraid
of
them
and
she
does
no
harm
to
any
one
she
does
not
belong
to
the
lewis
i
think
she
is
from
islay
but
she
sometimes
comes
to
pay
us
a
visit
at
borva
and
my
papa
is
very
kind
to
ingram
does
not
appear
to
know
her
i
thought
he
was
acquainted
with
every
one
in
the
island
said
lavender
was
not
here
when
he
has
been
in
the
lewis
before
said
sheila
eily
does
not
like
to
speak
to
strangers
and
i
do
not
think
you
could
get
her
to
speak
to
you
if
you
lavender
had
paid
but
little
attention
to
the
of
callernish
when
first
he
saw
them
but
now
he
approached
the
long
lines
of
big
stones
upon
this
lonely
plateau
with
a
new
interest
for
sheila
had
talked
to
him
about
them
many
a
time
in
borva
and
had
asked
his
opinion
about
their
origin
and
their
age
was
the
central
circle
of
stones
an
altar
with
the
other
series
marking
the
approaches
to
it
or
was
it
the
grave
of
some
great
chieftain
with
the
remaining
stones
indicating
the
graves
of
his
relations
and
friends
or
was
it
the
commemoration
of
some
battle
in
olden
times
or
the
record
of
astronomical
or
geometrical
discoveries
or
a
temple
once
devoted
to
or
what
lavender
who
knew
absolutely
nothing
at
all
about
the
matter
was
probably
as
well
qualified
as
anybody
else
to
answer
these
questions
but
he
forebore
the
interest
however
that
sheila
showed
in
such
things
he
very
rapidly
acquired
when
he
came
to
see
the
rows
of
stones
a
second
time
he
was
much
impressed
by
their
position
on
this
bit
of
hill
overlooking
the
sea
he
sat
down
on
his
with
the
determination
that
although
he
could
not
satisfy
wistful
questions
he
would
present
her
with
some
little
sketch
of
these
monuments
and
their
surroundings
which
might
catch
up
something
of
the
mysterious
loneliness
of
the
scene
he
would
not
of
course
have
the
picture
as
it
then
presented
itself
the
sun
was
glowing
on
the
grass
around
him
and
lighting
up
the
tall
gray
pillars
of
stone
with
a
cheerful
radiance
over
there
the
waters
of
loch
roag
were
bright
and
blue
and
beyond
the
lake
the
undulations
of
moorland
were
green
and
beautiful
and
the
mountains
in
the
south
grown
pale
as
silver
in
the
heat
here
was
a
pretty
young
lady
in
a
rough
blue
traveling
dress
and
a
hat
and
feather
who
was
engaged
in
picking
up
wild
flowers
from
the
warm
heath
there
was
a
gentleman
from
the
office
of
the
board
of
trade
who
was
sitting
on
the
grass
nursing
his
knees
and
whistling
from
time
to
time
the
chief
figure
in
the
foreground
was
an
elderly
gentleman
who
evidently
expected
that
he
was
going
to
be
put
into
the
picture
and
who
was
occasionally
dropping
a
cautious
hint
that
he
did
not
always
wear
this
costume
mackenzie
was
also
most
anxious
to
point
out
to
the
artist
the
names
of
the
hills
and
districts
lying
to
the
south
of
loch
roag
apparently
with
the
hope
that
the
sketch
would
have
a
certain
topographical
interest
for
future
visitors
no
lavender
was
content
at
that
moment
to
take
down
the
outlines
of
the
great
stones
and
the
configuration
of
the
lake
and
hill
beyond
but
by
and
by
he
would
give
another
sort
of
atmosphere
to
this
wild
scene
he
would
have
rain
and
darkness
spread
over
the
island
with
the
low
hills
in
the
south
grown
desolate
and
remote
and
the
waters
of
the
sea
covered
with
gloom
no
human
figure
should
be
visible
on
this
remote
plain
where
these
strange
memorials
had
stood
for
centuries
exposed
to
western
gales
and
the
stillness
of
the
winter
nights
and
the
awful
silence
of
the
stars
would
not
sheila
at
least
understand
the
bleakness
and
desolation
of
the
picture
of
course
her
father
would
like
to
have
everything
blue
and
green
he
seemed
a
little
disappointed
when
it
was
clear
that
no
distant
glimpse
of
borva
could
be
introduced
into
the
sketch
but
imagination
would
be
captured
by
this
sombre
picture
and
perhaps
by
and
by
in
some
other
land
amid
fairer
scenes
and
in
a
more
generous
climate
she
might
be
less
inclined
to
hunger
for
the
dark
and
melancholy
north
when
she
looked
on
this
record
of
its
gloom
and
sadness
he
going
to
put
any
people
in
the
pictures
said
mackenzie
in
a
confidential
whisper
to
ingram
ingram
got
up
from
the
grass
and
said
with
a
yawn
know
if
he
does
it
will
be
afterward
suppose
we
go
along
to
the
wagonette
and
see
if
duncan
has
brought
everything
up
from
the
boat
the
old
man
seemed
rather
unwilling
to
be
cut
out
of
this
particular
sketch
but
he
went
nevertheless
and
sheila
seeing
the
young
man
left
alone
and
thinking
that
not
quite
fair
went
over
to
him
and
asked
if
she
might
be
permitted
to
see
as
much
as
he
had
done
lavender
shut
up
the
book
he
said
with
a
laugh
shall
see
it
i
have
sufficient
memoranda
to
work
something
out
of
by
and
by
shall
we
have
another
look
at
the
circle
up
there
he
folded
up
and
shouldered
his
and
they
walked
up
to
the
point
at
which
the
lines
of
the
converged
perhaps
he
was
moved
by
a
great
antiquarian
curiosity
at
all
events
he
showed
a
singular
interest
in
the
monuments
and
talked
to
his
companion
about
all
the
possible
theories
connected
with
such
stones
in
a
fashion
that
charmed
her
greatly
she
was
easily
persuaded
that
the
callernish
were
the
most
interesting
relics
in
the
world
he
had
seen
stonehenge
but
stonehenge
was
too
scattered
to
be
impressive
there
was
more
mystery
about
the
means
by
which
the
inhabitants
of
a
small
island
could
have
hewn
and
carved
and
erected
these
blocks
there
was
moreover
the
mystery
about
the
vanished
population
itself
yes
he
had
been
to
carnac
also
he
had
driven
down
from
auray
in
a
lumbering
old
trap
his
coachman
being
unable
to
talk
french
he
had
seen
the
plain
on
which
there
were
rows
and
rows
of
small
stones
scarcely
to
be
distinguished
from
the
stone
walls
of
the
adjoining
farms
what
was
there
impressive
about
such
a
sight
when
you
went
into
a
house
and
paid
a
franc
to
be
shown
the
gold
ornaments
picked
up
about
the
place
here
however
was
a
perfect
series
of
those
strange
memorials
with
the
long
lanes
leading
up
to
a
circle
and
the
tallest
of
all
the
stones
placed
on
the
western
side
of
the
circle
perhaps
as
the
headstone
of
the
buried
chief
look
at
the
position
too
the
silent
hill
the
waters
of
the
around
it
and
beyond
that
the
desolation
of
miles
of
untenanted
moorland
sheila
looked
pleased
that
her
companion
after
coming
so
far
should
have
found
something
worth
looking
at
in
the
lewis
it
not
seem
strange
he
said
suddenly
think
of
young
folks
of
the
present
day
picking
up
wild
flowers
from
among
these
old
stones
he
was
looking
at
a
tiny
bouquet
which
she
had
gathered
you
take
them
she
said
quite
simply
and
naturally
offering
him
the
flowers
may
remind
you
some
time
of
he
took
the
flowers
and
regarded
them
for
a
moment
in
silence
and
then
he
said
gently
do
not
think
i
shall
want
these
to
remind
me
of
callernish
i
shall
never
forget
our
being
at
this
moment
perhaps
fortunately
duncan
appeared
and
came
along
toward
the
young
people
with
a
basket
in
his
hand
wass
mackenzie
will
ask
if
ye
will
tek
a
glass
whisky
sir
and
a
bit
bread
and
cheese
and
he
wass
there
was
no
hurry
at
all
and
he
will
wait
for
you
for
two
hours
or
half
an
hour
right
duncan
go
back
and
tell
him
i
have
finished
and
we
shall
be
there
directly
no
thank
you
take
out
the
whisky
unless
miss
mackenzie
added
the
young
man
with
a
smile
can
persuade
duncan
looked
with
amazement
at
the
man
who
dared
to
joke
about
miss
sheila
taking
whisky
and
without
waiting
for
any
further
commands
indignantly
shut
the
lid
of
the
basket
and
walked
off
wonder
miss
mackenzie
said
lavender
as
they
went
along
the
path
down
the
hill
wonder
what
you
would
say
if
i
happened
to
call
you
sheila
by
mistake
should
be
glad
if
you
did
that
every
one
calls
me
sheila
said
the
girl
quietly
enough
would
not
be
vexed
he
said
regarding
her
with
a
little
surprise
why
should
i
be
vexed
she
answered
and
she
happened
to
look
up
and
he
saw
what
a
clear
light
of
sincerity
there
was
shining
in
her
eyes
i
then
call
you
sheila
but
he
said
with
a
timidity
and
embarrassment
of
which
she
showed
no
trace
whatever
people
might
think
it
strange
you
know
and
yet
i
should
greatly
like
to
call
you
sheila
only
not
before
other
people
why
not
she
said
with
her
eyebrows
just
raised
a
little
should
you
wish
to
call
me
sheila
at
one
time
and
not
at
the
other
it
is
no
difference
whatever
and
every
one
calls
me
lavender
was
a
little
disappointed
he
had
hoped
when
she
consented
in
so
friendly
a
manner
to
his
calling
her
by
any
name
he
chose
that
he
could
have
established
this
little
arrangement
which
would
have
had
about
it
something
of
the
nature
of
a
personal
confidence
sheila
would
evidently
have
none
of
that
was
it
that
she
was
really
so
simple
and
frank
in
her
ways
that
she
did
not
understand
why
there
should
be
such
a
difference
and
what
it
might
imply
or
was
she
well
aware
of
everything
he
had
been
wishing
and
able
to
assume
this
air
of
simplicity
and
ignorance
with
a
perfect
grace
ingram
he
reflected
would
have
said
at
once
that
to
suspect
sheila
of
such
duplicity
was
to
insult
her
but
then
ingram
was
perhaps
himself
a
trifle
too
easily
imposed
on
and
he
had
notions
about
women
despite
all
his
philosophical
reading
and
such
like
that
a
little
more
mingling
in
society
might
have
caused
him
to
alter
frank
lavender
confessed
to
himself
that
sheila
was
either
a
miracle
of
ingenuousness
or
a
thorough
mistress
of
the
art
of
assuming
it
on
the
one
hand
he
considered
it
almost
impossible
for
a
woman
to
be
so
disingenuous
on
the
other
hand
how
could
this
girl
have
taught
herself
in
the
solitude
of
a
savage
island
a
species
of
histrionicism
which
women
in
london
circles
strove
for
years
to
acquire
and
rarely
acquired
in
any
perfection
at
all
events
he
said
to
himself
while
he
reserved
his
opinion
on
this
point
he
was
not
going
to
call
sheila
sheila
before
folks
who
would
know
what
that
meant
mackenzie
was
evidently
a
most
irascible
old
gentleman
goodness
only
knew
what
sort
of
law
prevailed
in
these
wild
parts
and
to
be
seized
at
midnight
by
a
couple
of
brawny
fishermen
to
be
carried
down
to
a
projecting
ledge
of
rock
had
not
ingram
already
hinted
that
mackenzie
would
straightway
throw
into
loch
roag
the
man
who
should
offer
to
carry
away
sheila
from
him
but
how
could
these
doubts
of
sincerity
last
he
sat
opposite
her
in
the
wagonette
and
the
perfect
truth
of
her
face
of
her
frank
eyes
and
of
her
ready
smile
met
him
at
every
moment
whether
he
talked
to
her
or
to
ingram
or
listened
to
old
mackenzie
who
turned
from
time
to
time
from
the
driving
of
the
horses
to
inform
the
stranger
of
what
he
saw
around
him
it
was
the
most
brilliant
of
mornings
the
sun
burned
on
the
white
road
on
the
green
moorland
on
the
gray
lichened
rocks
with
their
crimson
patches
of
heather
as
they
drove
by
the
curious
convolutions
of
this
rugged
coast
the
sea
that
lay
beyond
these
recurring
bays
and
points
was
of
a
windy
green
with
here
and
there
a
streak
of
white
and
the
fresh
breeze
blowing
across
to
them
tempered
the
fierce
heat
of
the
sun
how
cool
too
were
those
little
lakes
they
passed
the
clear
blue
and
white
of
them
stirred
into
wavelets
that
moved
the
reeds
and
left
about
the
stones
were
not
those
wild
geese
over
there
flapping
in
the
water
with
their
huge
wings
and
taking
no
notice
of
the
passing
strangers
lavender
had
never
seen
this
lonely
coast
in
times
of
gloom
with
those
little
lakes
becoming
sombre
pools
and
the
outline
of
the
rocks
beyond
lost
in
the
driving
mist
of
the
sea
and
the
rain
it
was
altogether
a
bright
and
beautiful
world
he
had
got
into
and
there
was
in
it
but
one
woman
beautiful
beyond
his
dreams
to
doubt
her
was
to
doubt
all
women
when
he
looked
at
her
he
forgot
the
caution
and
distrust
and
sardonic
his
southern
training
had
given
him
he
believed
and
the
world
seemed
to
be
filled
with
a
new
light
is
mackenzie
was
saying
it
iss
the
loch
of
the
mill
and
over
there
that
is
and
that
iss
the
loch
of
the
town
but
where
iss
the
loch
and
the
town
now
it
wass
many
hundreds
of
years
before
there
will
be
numbers
of
people
in
this
place
and
you
will
come
to
dun
charlobhaidh
which
is
a
great
castle
by
and
by
and
what
wass
it
will
drive
away
the
people
and
leave
the
land
to
the
moss
but
that
there
wass
no
one
to
look
after
them
the
natives
will
leave
islay
farewell
to
the
peace
of
that
iss
a
good
proverb
and
if
they
have
no
one
to
mind
them
they
will
go
away
altogether
and
there
is
no
people
more
obedient
than
the
people
of
the
highlands
not
anywhere
for
you
know
that
we
say
it
the
truth
as
if
you
were
speaking
before
kings
and
now
there
is
the
castle
and
there
wass
many
people
living
here
when
they
could
build
it
was
in
truth
one
of
those
circular
forts
the
date
of
which
has
given
rise
to
endless
conjecture
and
discussion
perched
up
on
a
hill
it
overlooked
a
number
of
deep
and
narrow
valleys
that
ran
landward
while
the
other
side
of
the
hill
sloped
down
to
the
it
was
a
striking
object
this
tumbling
mass
of
dark
stones
standing
high
over
the
green
hollows
and
over
the
light
plain
of
the
sea
was
there
not
here
material
for
another
sketch
for
sheila
while
lavender
had
gone
away
over
the
heights
and
hollows
to
choose
his
point
of
view
a
rough
and
ready
luncheon
had
been
spread
out
in
the
wagonette
and
when
he
returned
perspiring
and
considerably
blown
he
found
old
mackenzie
measuring
out
equal
portions
of
and
whisky
duncan
flicking
the
enormous
from
off
the
necks
ingram
trying
to
persuade
sheila
to
have
some
sherry
out
of
a
flask
he
carried
and
everybody
in
very
good
spirits
over
such
an
exciting
event
as
a
roadside
luncheon
on
a
summer
forenoon
the
king
of
borva
had
by
this
time
become
excellent
friends
with
the
young
stranger
who
had
ventured
into
his
dominions
when
the
old
gentleman
had
sufficiently
impressed
on
everybody
that
he
had
observed
all
necessary
precautions
in
studying
the
character
and
inquiring
into
the
antecedents
of
lavender
he
could
not
help
confessing
to
a
sense
of
lightness
and
vivacity
that
the
young
man
seemed
to
bring
with
him
and
shed
around
him
nor
was
this
matter
of
the
sketches
the
only
thing
that
had
particularly
recommended
lavender
to
the
old
man
mackenzie
had
a
most
distinct
dislike
to
gaelic
songs
he
could
not
bear
the
monotonous
melancholy
of
them
when
sheila
sitting
by
herself
would
sing
these
strange
old
ballads
of
an
evening
he
would
suddenly
enter
the
room
probably
find
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
then
he
would
in
his
inmost
heart
devote
the
whole
of
gaelic
minstrelsy
and
all
its
authors
to
the
infernal
gods
why
should
people
be
forever
maddening
themselves
with
the
stories
of
other
misfortunes
it
was
bad
enough
for
those
poor
people
but
they
had
borne
their
sorrows
and
died
and
were
at
peace
surely
it
was
better
that
we
should
have
songs
about
ourselves
drinking
or
fighting
if
you
like
to
keep
up
the
spirits
to
lighten
the
serious
cares
of
life
and
drown
for
a
while
the
responsibility
of
looking
after
a
whole
population
of
poor
unphilosophical
creatures
now
he
would
say
speaking
of
his
own
tongue
at
this
teffle
of
a
language
it
has
no
present
tense
to
its
verbs
the
people
they
are
always
looking
forward
to
a
melancholy
future
or
looking
back
to
a
melancholy
past
in
the
name
of
kott
hef
we
not
got
ourselves
to
live
this
day
we
live
in
is
better
than
any
day
that
wass
before
or
iss
to
come
bekass
it
is
here
we
are
alive
and
i
will
hef
no
more
of
these
songs
about
crying
and
crying
and
crying
now
sheila
and
lavender
in
their
musical
mutual
confidences
had
at
an
early
period
discovered
that
each
of
them
knew
something
of
the
older
english
duets
and
forthwith
they
tried
a
few
of
them
to
extreme
delight
here
at
last
was
a
sort
of
music
he
could
understand
none
of
your
moanings
of
widows
and
cries
of
luckless
girls
to
the
sea
but
good
commonsense
songs
in
which
the
lads
kissed
the
lasses
with
a
will
and
had
a
good
drink
afterward
and
a
dance
on
the
green
on
their
homeward
way
there
was
fun
in
those
happy
and
good
health
and
briskness
in
the
choruses
and
throughout
them
all
a
prevailing
cheerfulness
and
contentment
with
the
conditions
of
life
certain
to
recommend
itself
to
the
contemplative
mind
mackenzie
never
grew
tired
of
hearing
those
simple
ditties
he
grew
confidential
with
the
young
man
and
told
him
that
those
fine
commonsense
songs
recalled
pleasant
scenes
to
him
he
himself
knew
something
of
english
village
life
when
he
had
been
up
to
see
the
great
exhibition
he
had
gone
to
visit
a
friend
living
in
brighton
and
he
had
surveyed
the
country
with
an
observant
eye
he
had
remarked
several
with
the
standing
here
and
there
in
front
of
the
cottages
emblazoned
with
beautiful
banners
he
had
it
is
true
fancied
that
the
should
be
in
the
centre
of
the
green
but
the
manner
in
which
the
waves
of
population
swept
here
and
there
swallowing
up
open
spaces
and
so
forth
would
account
to
a
philosophical
person
for
the
fact
that
the
were
now
close
to
the
village
shops
to
me
only
with
thine
eyes
hummed
the
king
of
borva
to
himself
as
he
sent
the
two
little
horses
along
the
coast
road
on
this
warm
summer
day
he
had
heard
the
song
for
the
first
time
on
the
previous
evening
he
had
no
voice
to
speak
of
he
had
missed
the
air
and
these
were
all
the
words
he
remembered
but
it
was
a
notable
compliment
all
the
same
to
the
young
man
who
had
brought
these
pleasant
tunes
to
the
island
and
so
they
drove
on
through
the
keen
salt
air
with
the
sea
shining
beside
them
and
the
sky
shining
over
them
and
in
the
afternoon
they
arrived
at
the
small
remote
and
solitary
inn
of
barvas
placed
near
the
confluence
of
several
rivers
that
flow
through
loch
barvas
or
barabbas
to
the
sea
here
they
proposed
to
stop
the
night
so
that
lavender
when
his
room
had
been
assigned
to
him
begged
to
be
left
alone
for
an
hour
or
two
that
he
might
throw
a
little
color
into
his
sketch
of
callernish
what
was
there
to
see
at
barvas
why
nothing
but
the
channels
of
the
brown
streams
some
pasture
land
and
a
few
huts
then
the
unfrequented
lake
and
beyond
that
some
ridges
of
white
sand
standing
over
the
shingly
beach
of
the
sea
he
would
join
them
at
dinner
mackenzie
protested
in
a
mild
way
he
really
wanted
to
see
how
the
island
was
to
be
illustrated
by
the
stranger
there
was
a
greater
protest
mingled
with
compassion
and
regret
in
eyes
but
the
young
man
was
firm
so
they
let
him
have
his
way
and
gave
him
full
possession
of
the
common
while
they
set
off
to
visit
the
school
and
the
free
church
manse
and
what
not
in
the
neighborhood
mackenzie
had
ordered
dinner
at
eight
to
show
that
he
was
familiar
with
the
ways
of
civilized
life
and
when
they
returned
at
that
hour
lavender
had
two
sketches
finished
they
are
very
good
said
ingram
who
was
seldom
enthusiastic
about
his
work
but
old
mackenzie
was
so
vastly
pleased
with
the
picture
which
represented
his
native
place
in
the
brightest
of
sunshine
and
colors
that
he
forgot
to
assume
a
critical
air
he
said
nothing
against
the
rainy
and
desolate
version
of
the
scene
that
had
been
given
to
sheila
it
was
good
enough
to
please
the
child
but
here
was
something
brilliant
effective
cheerful
and
he
alarmed
lavender
not
a
little
by
proposing
to
get
one
of
the
natives
to
carry
this
treasure
then
and
there
back
to
borvapost
both
sketches
were
ultimately
returned
to
his
book
and
then
sheila
helped
him
to
remove
his
artistic
apparatus
from
the
table
on
which
their
plain
and
homely
meal
was
to
be
placed
as
she
was
about
to
follow
her
father
and
ingram
who
had
left
the
room
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
said
to
lavender
with
a
look
of
frank
gratitude
in
her
eyes
is
very
good
of
you
to
have
pleased
my
papa
so
much
i
know
when
he
is
pleased
though
he
does
not
speak
of
it
and
it
is
not
often
he
will
be
so
much
you
sheila
said
the
young
man
unconscious
of
the
familiarity
he
was
using
and
only
remembering
that
she
had
scarcely
thanked
him
for
the
other
sketch
there
is
nothing
that
will
please
me
so
much
as
to
see
him
pleased
she
said
with
a
smile
he
was
about
to
open
the
door
for
her
but
he
kept
his
hand
on
the
handle
and
said
earnestly
enough
that
is
such
a
small
matter
an
work
if
you
only
knew
how
gladly
i
would
live
all
my
life
here
if
only
i
could
do
you
some
greater
service
she
looked
a
little
surprised
and
then
for
one
brief
second
reflected
english
was
not
wholly
familiar
to
her
perhaps
she
had
failed
to
catch
what
he
really
meant
but
at
all
events
she
said
gravely
and
simply
would
soon
tire
of
living
here
it
is
not
always
a
and
then
without
lifting
her
eyes
to
his
face
she
turned
to
the
door
and
he
opened
it
for
her
and
she
was
gone
it
was
about
ten
when
they
went
outside
for
their
evening
stroll
and
all
the
world
had
grown
enchanted
since
they
had
seen
it
in
the
colors
of
the
sunset
there
was
no
night
but
a
strange
clearness
over
the
sky
and
the
earth
and
down
in
the
south
the
moon
was
rising
over
the
barvas
hills
in
the
meadows
the
cattle
were
still
grazing
voices
of
children
could
be
heard
in
the
far
distance
with
the
rumbling
of
a
cart
coming
through
the
silence
and
the
murmur
of
the
streams
flowing
down
to
the
loch
the
loch
itself
lay
like
a
line
of
dusky
yellow
in
a
darkened
hollow
near
the
sea
having
caught
on
its
surface
the
pale
glow
of
the
northern
heavens
where
the
sun
had
gone
down
hours
before
the
air
was
warm
and
yet
fresh
with
the
odors
of
the
atlantic
and
there
was
a
scent
of
dutch
clover
coming
across
from
the
sandy
pastures
nearer
the
coast
the
huts
of
the
small
hamlet
could
but
faintly
be
made
out
beyond
the
dark
and
pastures
but
a
long
pale
line
of
blue
smoke
lay
in
the
motionless
air
and
the
voices
of
the
children
told
of
open
doors
night
after
night
this
same
picture
with
slight
variations
of
position
had
been
placed
before
the
stranger
who
had
come
to
view
these
solitudes
and
night
after
night
it
seemed
to
him
to
grow
more
beautiful
he
could
put
down
on
paper
the
outlines
of
an
landscape
and
give
them
a
dash
of
brilliant
color
to
look
well
on
a
wall
but
how
to
carry
away
except
in
the
memory
any
impression
of
the
strange
lambent
darkness
the
tender
hues
the
loneliness
and
the
pathos
of
those
northern
twilights
they
walked
down
by
the
side
of
one
of
the
streams
towards
the
sea
but
sheila
was
not
his
companion
on
this
occasion
her
father
laid
hold
of
him
and
was
expounding
to
him
the
rights
of
capitalists
and
various
other
matters
but
by
and
by
lavender
drew
his
companion
on
to
talk
of
mother
and
here
at
least
mackenzie
was
neither
tedious
nor
ridiculous
nor
unnecessarily
garrulous
it
was
with
a
strange
interest
the
young
man
heard
the
elderly
man
talk
of
his
courtship
his
marriage
the
character
of
his
wife
and
her
goodness
and
beauty
was
it
not
like
looking
at
a
former
sheila
and
would
not
this
sheila
now
walking
before
him
go
through
the
same
tender
experiences
and
be
admired
and
loved
and
petted
by
everybody
as
this
other
girl
had
been
who
brought
with
her
the
charm
of
winning
ways
and
a
gentle
nature
into
these
rude
wilds
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
heard
mackenzie
speak
of
his
wife
and
it
turned
out
to
be
the
last
but
from
that
moment
the
older
man
had
something
of
dignity
in
the
eyes
of
this
younger
man
who
had
merely
judged
him
by
his
little
foibles
and
eccentricities
and
would
have
been
ready
to
dismiss
him
contemptuously
as
a
buffoon
there
was
something
then
behind
that
powerful
face
with
its
deep
cut
lines
its
heavy
eyebrows
and
piercing
and
sometimes
sad
eyes
besides
a
mere
liking
for
tricks
of
childish
diplomacy
lavender
began
to
have
some
respect
for
father
and
made
a
resolution
to
guard
against
the
impertinence
of
humoring
him
too
ostentatiously
was
it
not
hard
though
that
ingram
who
was
so
cold
and
unimpressionable
who
smiled
at
the
notion
of
marrying
and
who
was
probably
enjoying
his
pipe
quite
as
much
as
familiar
talk
should
have
the
girl
all
to
himself
on
this
witching
night
they
reached
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
coming
in
from
that
sea
but
the
air
seemed
even
sweeter
and
cooler
as
they
sat
down
on
the
great
bank
of
shingle
here
and
there
birds
were
calling
and
sheila
could
distinguish
each
one
of
them
as
the
moon
rose
a
faint
golden
light
began
to
tremble
here
and
there
on
the
waves
as
if
some
subterranean
caverns
were
lit
up
and
sending
up
to
the
surface
faint
and
fitful
rays
of
their
splendor
farther
along
the
coast
the
tall
banks
of
white
sand
grew
white
in
the
twilight
and
the
outlines
of
the
dark
behind
grew
more
distinct
but
when
they
rose
to
go
back
to
barvas
the
moonlight
had
grown
full
and
clear
and
the
long
and
narrow
loch
had
a
pathway
of
gold
across
stretching
from
the
reeds
and
sedges
of
the
one
side
to
the
reeds
and
sedges
of
the
other
and
now
ingram
had
gone
on
to
join
mackenzie
and
sheila
walked
behind
with
lavender
and
her
face
was
pale
and
beautiful
in
the
moonlight
shall
be
very
sorry
when
i
have
to
leave
lewis
he
said
as
they
walked
along
the
path
leading
through
the
sand
and
the
clover
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
felt
the
regret
expressed
in
the
words
it
is
no
use
to
speak
of
leaving
us
yet
said
sheila
cheerfully
is
a
long
time
before
you
will
go
away
from
the
i
fancy
i
shall
always
think
of
the
island
just
as
it
is
now
with
the
moonlight
over
there
and
a
loch
near
and
you
walking
through
the
stillness
we
have
had
so
many
evening
walks
like
will
make
us
very
vain
of
our
island
said
the
girl
with
a
smile
you
will
speak
like
that
always
to
us
is
there
no
moonlight
in
england
i
have
pictures
of
english
scenery
that
will
be
far
more
beautiful
than
any
we
have
here
and
if
there
is
the
moon
here
it
will
be
there
too
think
of
the
pictures
of
the
river
thames
that
my
papa
showed
you
last
night
but
there
is
nothing
like
this
in
the
south
said
the
young
man
impetuously
do
not
believe
there
is
in
the
world
anything
so
beautiful
as
this
sheila
what
would
you
say
if
i
resolved
to
come
and
live
here
always
should
like
that
very
much
more
than
you
would
like
it
perhaps
she
said
with
a
bright
laugh
would
please
you
better
than
for
you
to
go
always
and
live
in
england
would
it
not
that
is
impossible
she
said
papa
would
never
think
of
living
in
for
some
time
after
he
was
silent
the
two
figures
in
front
of
them
walked
steadily
on
an
occasional
roar
of
laughter
from
the
deep
chest
of
mackenzie
startling
the
night
air
and
telling
of
being
in
a
communicative
mood
at
last
lavender
said
seems
to
me
a
great
pity
that
you
should
live
in
this
remote
place
and
have
so
little
amusement
and
see
so
few
people
of
tastes
and
education
like
your
own
your
papa
is
so
much
occupied
he
is
so
much
older
than
you
too
that
you
must
be
left
to
yourself
so
much
whereas
if
you
had
a
companion
of
your
own
age
who
could
have
the
right
to
talk
frankly
to
you
and
go
about
with
you
and
take
care
of
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
little
wooden
bridge
crossing
the
stream
and
mackenzie
and
ingram
had
got
to
the
inn
where
they
stood
in
front
of
the
door
in
the
moonlight
before
ascending
the
steps
of
the
bridge
lavender
without
pausing
in
his
speech
took
hand
and
said
suddenly
let
me
alarm
you
sheila
but
suppose
at
some
distant
day
as
far
away
as
you
please
i
came
and
asked
you
to
let
me
be
your
companion
then
and
always
you
try
she
looked
up
with
a
startled
glance
of
fear
in
her
eyes
and
withdrew
her
hand
from
him
be
frightened
he
said
quite
gently
ask
you
for
any
promise
sheila
you
must
know
i
love
you
you
must
have
seen
it
will
you
not
let
me
come
to
you
at
some
future
time
a
long
way
off
that
you
may
tell
me
then
you
try
to
do
that
there
was
more
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
than
in
his
words
the
girl
stood
irresolute
for
a
second
or
two
regarding
him
with
a
strange
wistful
earnest
look
and
then
a
great
gentleness
came
into
her
eyes
and
she
put
out
her
hand
to
him
and
said
in
a
low
voice
but
there
was
something
so
grave
and
simple
about
her
manner
at
this
moment
that
he
dared
not
somehow
receive
it
as
a
lover
receives
the
first
admission
of
love
from
the
lips
of
a
maiden
there
had
been
something
of
a
strange
inquiry
in
her
face
as
she
regarded
him
for
a
second
or
two
and
now
that
her
eyes
were
bent
on
the
ground
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
trying
to
realize
the
full
effect
of
the
concession
she
had
made
he
would
not
let
her
think
he
took
her
hand
and
raised
it
respectfully
to
his
lips
and
then
he
led
her
forward
to
the
bridge
not
a
word
was
spoken
between
them
while
they
crossed
the
shining
space
of
moonlight
to
the
shadow
of
the
house
and
as
they
went
he
caught
but
one
glimpse
of
her
eyes
and
they
were
friendly
and
kind
toward
him
but
evidently
troubled
he
saw
no
more
that
night
so
he
had
asked
sheila
to
be
his
wife
and
she
had
given
him
some
timid
encouragement
as
to
the
future
many
a
time
within
these
last
few
days
had
he
sketched
out
an
imaginative
picture
of
the
scene
he
was
familiar
with
the
passionate
rapture
of
lovers
on
the
stage
in
books
and
in
pictures
and
he
had
described
himself
to
himself
as
intoxicated
with
joy
anxious
to
let
the
whole
world
know
of
his
good
fortune
and
above
all
to
confide
the
tidings
of
his
happiness
to
his
constant
friend
and
companion
but
now
as
he
sat
in
one
corner
of
the
room
he
almost
feared
to
be
spoken
to
by
the
two
men
who
sat
at
the
table
with
steaming
glasses
before
them
he
dared
not
tell
ingram
he
had
no
wish
to
tell
him
even
if
he
had
got
him
alone
and
as
he
sat
there
and
recalled
the
incident
that
had
just
occurred
by
the
side
of
the
little
bridge
he
could
not
wholly
understand
its
meaning
there
had
been
none
of
the
eagerness
the
coyness
the
tumult
of
joy
he
had
expected
all
he
could
remember
clearly
was
the
long
look
that
the
large
earnest
troubled
eyes
had
fixed
upon
him
while
the
face
grown
pale
in
the
moonlight
seemed
somehow
and
strange
chapter
vii
an
intermeddler
but
in
the
morning
all
these
idle
fancies
fled
with
the
life
and
color
and
freshness
of
a
new
day
loch
barvas
was
ruffled
into
a
dark
blue
by
the
westerly
wind
and
doubtless
the
sea
out
there
was
running
in
green
and
cold
to
the
shore
the
sunlight
was
warm
about
the
house
the
trout
were
leaping
in
the
shallow
brown
streams
and
here
and
there
a
white
butterfly
fluttered
across
the
damp
meadows
was
not
that
duncan
down
by
the
river
accompanied
by
ingram
there
was
a
glimmer
of
a
rod
in
the
sunshine
the
two
poachers
were
after
trout
for
breakfast
lavender
dressed
went
outside
and
looked
about
for
the
nearest
way
down
to
the
stream
he
wished
to
have
a
chance
of
saying
a
word
to
his
friend
before
sheila
or
her
father
should
appear
and
at
last
he
thought
he
could
do
no
better
than
go
across
to
the
bridge
and
so
make
his
way
down
to
the
banks
of
the
river
what
a
fresh
morning
it
was
with
all
sorts
of
sweet
scents
in
the
air
and
here
sure
enough
was
a
pretty
picture
in
the
early
light
a
young
girl
coming
over
the
bridge
carrying
a
load
of
green
grass
on
her
back
what
would
she
say
if
he
asked
her
to
stop
for
a
moment
that
he
might
sketch
her
pretty
costume
her
was
a
scarlet
handkerchief
tied
behind
she
wore
a
bodice
of
flannel
and
petticoats
of
gray
flannel
while
she
had
a
and
pouch
of
brilliant
blue
did
she
know
of
these
harmonies
of
color
or
of
the
picturesqueness
of
her
appearance
as
she
came
across
the
bridge
in
the
sunlight
as
she
drew
near
she
stared
at
the
stranger
with
the
big
dumb
eyes
of
a
wild
animal
there
was
no
fear
only
a
sort
of
surprised
observation
in
them
and
as
she
passed
she
uttered
without
a
smile
some
brief
and
laconic
salutation
in
gaelic
which
of
course
the
young
man
could
not
understand
he
raised
his
cap
however
and
said
morning
and
went
on
with
a
fixed
resolve
to
learn
all
the
gaelic
that
duncan
could
teach
him
surely
the
tall
keeper
was
in
excellent
spirits
this
morning
long
before
he
drew
near
lavender
could
hear
in
the
still
of
the
morning
that
he
was
telling
stories
about
john
the
piper
and
of
his
adventures
in
such
distant
parts
as
portree
and
oban
and
even
in
glasgow
it
was
allan
of
styornoway
duncan
was
saying
as
he
industriously
whipped
the
shallow
runs
of
the
stream
go
to
glasgow
with
john
and
they
went
through
ta
crinan
canal
wass
you
through
ta
crinan
canal
sir
a
jist
that
and
i
hef
been
told
it
iss
like
a
river
with
ta
sides
a
house
to
it
and
what
would
allan
care
for
a
thing
like
that
when
he
hass
been
to
america
more
than
twice
or
four
times
and
it
wass
when
he
fell
into
the
canal
he
was
ferry
nearly
trooned
for
all
that
and
when
they
pulled
him
to
ta
shore
he
wass
a
ferry
angry
man
and
this
iss
what
john
says
that
allan
will
say
when
he
wass
on
the
side
of
the
canal
says
he
i
was
trooned
here
i
would
show
my
face
in
styornoway
no
but
perhaps
it
iss
not
true
for
he
will
tell
many
lies
does
john
the
piper
to
hef
a
laugh
at
a
crinan
canal
is
not
to
be
despised
duncan
said
ingram
who
was
sitting
on
the
red
sand
of
the
bank
you
are
in
do
you
know
what
john
says
that
allan
will
say
to
him
the
first
time
they
went
ashore
at
glasgow
am
sure
i
was
many
years
ago
before
that
allan
will
be
going
many
times
to
america
and
he
will
neffer
hef
seen
such
fine
shops
and
ta
big
houses
and
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
people
every
one
with
shoes
on
their
feet
and
he
will
say
to
john
ef
i
had
known
in
time
i
should
hef
been
born
but
no
one
will
believe
it
iss
true
he
is
such
a
teffle
of
a
liar
that
john
and
he
will
hef
some
stories
about
mackenzie
himself
as
i
hef
been
told
that
he
will
tell
when
he
goes
to
styornoway
but
john
is
a
ferry
cunning
fellow
and
will
not
tell
any
such
stories
in
suppose
if
he
did
duncan
you
would
dip
him
in
loch
there
iss
more
than
one
said
duncan
with
a
grim
twinkle
in
his
eye
iss
more
than
one
that
would
hef
a
joke
with
him
if
he
was
to
tell
stories
about
lavender
had
been
standing
listening
unknown
to
both
he
now
went
forward
and
bade
them
and
then
having
had
a
look
at
the
trout
that
duncan
had
caught
pulled
ingram
up
from
the
bank
put
his
arm
in
his
and
walked
away
with
him
he
said
suddenly
with
a
laugh
and
a
shrug
know
i
always
come
to
you
when
in
a
suppose
you
do
said
the
other
you
are
always
welcome
to
whatever
help
i
can
give
you
but
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
you
rush
into
fixes
with
the
sort
of
notion
that
i
am
responsible
for
getting
you
can
assure
you
nothing
of
the
kind
is
the
case
i
could
not
be
so
ungrateful
however
in
the
meantime
that
is
the
fact
is
i
asked
sheila
last
night
if
she
should
marry
devil
you
did
ingram
dropped
his
arm
and
stood
looking
at
him
i
knew
you
would
be
angry
said
the
younger
man
in
a
tone
of
apology
i
know
i
have
been
too
precipitate
but
i
thought
of
the
short
time
we
should
be
remaining
here
and
of
the
difficulty
of
getting
an
explanation
made
at
an
another
time
and
it
was
really
only
to
give
her
a
hint
as
to
my
own
feelings
that
i
spoke
i
could
not
bear
to
wait
any
mind
about
yourself
said
ingram
somewhat
curtly
did
sheila
say
nothing
definite
what
could
you
expect
a
girl
to
say
after
so
short
an
acquaintance
but
this
i
can
tell
you
that
the
proposal
is
not
altogether
distasteful
to
her
and
that
i
have
permission
to
speak
to
her
at
some
future
time
when
we
have
known
each
other
have
are
quite
sure
is
no
mistake
about
her
silence
for
example
that
might
have
led
you
into
misinterpreting
her
wishes
altogether
of
the
kind
is
possible
of
course
i
could
not
ask
the
girl
for
any
promise
or
anything
of
that
sort
all
i
asked
was
whether
she
would
allow
me
at
some
future
time
to
ask
her
more
definitely
and
i
am
so
well
satisfied
with
her
reply
that
i
am
convinced
i
shall
marry
is
this
the
fix
you
wish
me
to
help
you
out
of
said
ingram
rather
coldly
ingram
said
the
younger
man
in
penitential
tones
cut
up
rough
about
it
you
know
what
i
mean
perhaps
i
have
been
hasty
and
inconsiderate
about
it
but
one
thing
you
may
be
sure
that
sheila
will
never
have
to
complain
of
me
if
she
marries
me
you
say
i
know
her
yet
but
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
before
we
are
married
i
propose
to
carry
her
off
morning
now
ingram
you
know
what
i
mean
about
helping
me
in
the
fix
helping
me
with
her
father
you
know
and
with
herself
for
the
matter
of
that
you
can
do
anything
with
her
she
has
such
a
belief
in
you
you
should
hear
how
she
talks
of
you
you
never
heard
anything
like
it
was
an
innocent
bit
of
flattery
and
ingram
smiled
at
the
ingenuousness
after
all
was
he
not
more
loveable
and
more
sincere
in
this
little
bit
of
simple
craft
used
in
the
piteousness
of
his
appeal
than
when
he
was
giving
himself
the
airs
of
a
and
talking
of
women
in
a
fashion
which
to
do
him
justice
expressed
nothing
of
his
real
sentiments
ingram
walked
on
and
said
in
his
slow
and
deliberate
way
know
i
opposed
this
project
of
yours
from
the
first
i
think
you
have
acted
fairly
by
sheila
or
her
father
or
myself
who
brought
you
out
here
but
if
sheila
has
been
drawn
into
it
why
then
the
whole
affair
is
altered
and
got
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
was
sure
you
would
say
that
exclaimed
the
younger
man
with
a
brighter
light
appearing
on
his
face
may
call
me
all
the
hard
names
you
like
i
deserve
them
all
and
more
but
then
as
you
say
since
sheila
is
in
it
do
your
best
you
frank
lavender
could
not
make
out
why
the
taciturn
and
man
walking
beside
him
seemed
to
be
greatly
amused
by
this
speech
but
he
was
in
no
humor
to
take
offence
he
knew
that
once
ingram
had
promised
him
his
help
he
would
not
lack
all
the
advocacy
the
advice
and
even
the
money
should
that
become
necessary
that
a
and
disinterested
friend
could
offer
many
and
many
a
time
ingram
had
helped
him
and
now
he
was
to
come
to
his
assistance
in
the
most
serious
crisis
of
his
life
ingram
would
remove
doubts
ingram
would
persuade
old
mackenzie
that
girls
had
to
get
married
some
time
or
other
and
that
sheila
ought
to
live
in
london
ingram
would
be
commissioned
to
break
the
news
to
mrs
lavender
but
here
when
the
young
man
thought
of
the
interview
with
his
aunt
which
he
would
have
to
encounter
a
cold
shiver
passed
through
his
frame
he
would
not
think
of
it
he
would
enjoy
the
present
hour
difficulties
only
grew
the
bigger
the
more
they
were
looked
at
when
they
were
left
to
themselves
they
frequently
disappeared
it
was
another
proof
of
kindness
that
he
had
not
even
mentioned
the
old
lady
down
in
kensington
who
was
likely
to
have
something
to
say
about
this
marriage
are
a
great
many
difficulties
in
the
way
said
ingram
thoughtfully
said
lavender
with
much
eagerness
then
look
you
may
be
sure
that
if
we
get
over
these
sheila
will
know
well
who
managed
it
and
she
will
not
be
ungrateful
to
you
i
think
if
we
ever
should
be
married
i
am
certain
she
will
always
look
on
you
as
her
greatest
is
a
big
bribe
said
the
elder
man
perhaps
a
trifle
sadly
and
lavender
looked
at
him
with
some
vague
return
of
a
suspicion
that
some
time
or
other
ingram
must
himself
have
been
in
love
with
sheila
they
returned
to
the
inn
where
they
found
mackenzie
busy
with
a
heap
of
letters
and
newspapers
that
had
been
sent
across
to
him
from
stornoway
the
whole
of
the
was
littered
with
wrappers
and
big
blue
envelopes
where
was
sheila
who
usually
waited
on
her
father
at
such
times
to
keep
his
affairs
in
order
sheila
was
outside
and
lavender
saw
her
through
the
open
window
was
she
not
waiting
for
him
that
she
should
pace
up
and
down
by
herself
with
her
face
turned
away
from
the
house
he
immediately
went
out
and
went
over
to
her
and
she
turned
to
him
as
he
approached
he
fancied
she
looked
a
trifle
pale
and
far
less
bright
and
joyous
than
the
ordinary
sheila
lavender
she
said
walking
away
from
the
house
wish
very
much
to
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
last
night
it
was
all
a
misfortune
that
i
did
not
understand
and
i
wish
you
to
forget
that
a
word
was
ever
spoken
about
her
head
was
bent
down
and
her
speech
was
low
and
broken
what
she
failed
to
explain
in
words
her
manner
explained
for
her
but
her
companion
said
to
her
with
alarm
and
surprise
in
his
tone
sheila
you
can
not
be
so
cruel
surely
you
need
not
feel
any
embarrassment
through
so
slight
a
promise
it
pledges
you
to
nothing
it
leaves
you
quite
free
and
some
day
if
i
come
and
ask
you
then
a
question
i
have
not
asked
you
yet
then
will
be
time
enough
to
give
me
an
no
no
said
the
girl
obviously
in
great
distress
can
not
do
that
it
is
unjust
to
you
to
let
you
think
of
it
and
hope
about
it
it
was
last
night
everything
was
strange
to
me
i
did
not
understand
then
but
i
have
thought
about
it
all
the
night
through
and
now
i
called
her
father
from
the
inside
of
the
inn
and
she
turned
to
go
you
do
not
ask
that
do
you
he
said
are
only
frightened
a
little
bit
just
now
but
that
will
go
away
there
is
nothing
to
be
frightened
about
you
have
been
thinking
over
it
and
imagining
impossible
things
you
have
been
thinking
of
leaving
borva
altogether
that
i
can
never
do
she
said
with
a
pathetic
earnestness
why
think
of
such
a
thing
he
said
need
not
look
at
all
the
possible
troubles
of
life
when
you
take
such
a
simple
step
as
this
sheila
be
hasty
in
any
such
resolve
you
may
be
sure
all
the
gloomy
things
you
have
been
thinking
of
will
disappear
when
we
get
close
to
them
and
this
is
such
a
simple
thing
i
ask
you
to
say
you
will
be
my
wife
i
have
no
right
to
ask
you
yet
but
i
have
only
asked
permission
of
you
to
let
me
think
of
it
and
even
ingram
sees
no
great
harm
in
know
she
said
with
a
start
of
surprise
and
fear
said
lavender
wishing
he
had
bitten
his
tongue
in
two
before
he
had
uttered
the
word
know
we
have
no
secrets
from
each
other
and
to
whom
could
i
go
for
advice
but
to
your
oldest
friend
what
did
he
say
she
asked
with
a
strange
look
in
her
eyes
he
sees
a
great
many
difficulties
but
he
thinks
they
will
easily
be
got
she
said
with
her
eyes
again
cast
down
and
a
certain
sadness
in
her
tone
must
explain
to
him
too
and
tell
him
i
had
no
understanding
of
what
i
said
last
you
do
that
urged
the
young
man
means
nothing
it
pledges
you
to
sheila
cried
her
father
cheerily
from
the
window
in
and
let
us
hef
our
papa
said
the
girl
and
she
went
into
the
house
followed
by
her
companion
but
how
could
she
find
an
opportunity
of
making
this
explanation
shortly
after
breakfast
the
wagonette
was
at
the
door
of
the
little
barvas
inn
and
sheila
came
out
of
the
house
and
took
her
place
in
it
with
an
unusual
quietness
of
manner
and
hopelessness
of
look
ingram
sitting
opposite
to
her
and
knowing
nothing
of
what
had
taken
place
fancied
that
this
was
but
an
expression
of
girlish
timidity
and
that
it
was
his
business
to
interest
her
and
amuse
her
until
she
should
forget
the
strangeness
and
newness
of
her
position
nay
as
he
had
resolved
to
make
the
best
of
matters
as
they
stood
and
as
he
believed
that
sheila
had
half
confessed
to
a
special
liking
for
his
friend
from
the
south
what
more
fitting
thing
could
he
do
than
endeavor
to
place
lavender
in
the
most
favorable
light
in
her
eyes
he
began
to
talk
of
all
the
brilliant
and
successful
things
the
young
man
had
done
as
fully
as
he
could
before
himself
he
contrived
to
introduce
pretty
anecdotes
of
generosity
and
there
were
plenty
of
these
for
the
young
fellow
had
never
a
thought
of
consequences
if
he
was
touched
by
a
tale
of
distress
and
if
he
could
help
the
sufferer
either
with
his
own
or
any
one
money
ingram
talked
of
all
their
excursions
together
in
devonshire
in
brittany
and
elsewhere
to
impress
on
sheila
how
well
he
knew
his
friend
and
how
long
their
intimacy
had
lasted
at
first
the
girl
was
singularly
reserved
and
silent
but
somehow
as
pleasant
recollections
were
multiplied
and
as
lavender
seemed
to
have
been
always
the
associate
and
companion
of
this
old
friend
of
hers
some
brighter
expression
came
into
her
face
and
she
grew
more
interested
lavender
not
knowing
whether
or
not
to
take
her
decision
of
that
morning
as
final
and
not
wholly
perceiving
the
aim
of
this
kindly
chat
on
the
part
of
his
friend
began
to
see
at
least
that
sheila
was
pleased
to
hear
the
two
men
help
out
each
stories
about
their
pedestrian
excursions
and
that
she
at
last
grew
bold
enough
to
look
up
and
meet
his
eyes
in
a
timid
fashion
when
she
asked
him
a
question
so
they
drove
along
by
the
side
of
the
sea
the
level
and
road
leading
them
through
miles
and
miles
of
rough
moorland
with
here
and
there
a
few
huts
or
a
to
break
the
monotony
of
the
undulating
here
and
there
too
there
were
great
cuttings
of
the
with
a
thin
line
of
water
in
the
foot
of
the
deep
black
trenches
sometimes
again
they
would
escape
altogether
from
any
traces
of
human
habitation
and
duncan
would
grow
excited
in
pointing
out
to
miss
sheila
the
young
grouse
that
had
run
off
the
road
into
the
heather
where
they
stood
and
eyed
the
passing
carriage
with
anything
but
a
frightened
air
and
while
mackenzie
hummed
something
resembling
but
very
vaguely
resembling
in
thine
eyes
sits
beaming
and
while
ingram
in
his
quiet
desultory
and
often
sardonic
fashion
amused
the
young
girl
with
stories
of
her
bravery
and
kindness
and
escapades
the
merry
trot
of
the
horses
beat
time
to
the
bells
on
their
necks
the
fresh
west
wind
blew
a
cloud
of
white
dust
away
over
the
moorland
behind
them
there
was
a
blue
sky
shining
all
around
them
and
the
blue
atlantic
basking
in
the
light
they
stopped
a
few
moments
at
both
the
hamlets
of
suainabost
and
tabost
to
allow
sheila
to
pay
a
hurried
visit
to
one
or
two
of
the
huts
while
mackenzie
laying
hold
of
some
of
the
fishermen
he
knew
got
them
to
show
lavender
the
in
which
the
young
gentleman
professed
himself
profoundly
interested
they
also
visited
the
and
lavender
found
himself
beginning
to
look
upon
a
building
with
windows
as
something
imposing
and
a
decided
triumph
of
human
skill
and
enterprise
but
what
was
the
of
tabost
to
the
grand
building
at
the
butt
they
had
driven
away
from
the
by
a
path
leading
through
long
and
pastures
of
dutch
clover
they
had
got
up
from
these
sandy
swathes
to
a
of
rock
and
here
and
there
they
got
glimpses
of
fearful
precipices
leading
sheer
down
to
the
boiling
and
dashing
sea
the
curious
contortions
of
the
rocks
the
sharp
needles
of
them
springing
in
isolated
pillars
from
out
of
the
water
the
roar
of
the
eddying
currents
that
swept
through
the
chasms
and
dashed
against
the
shore
the
wild
that
flew
about
and
screamed
over
the
rushing
waves
and
the
surge
naturally
enough
drew
the
attention
of
the
strangers
altogether
away
from
the
land
and
it
was
with
a
start
of
surprise
they
found
themselves
before
an
immense
mass
of
yellow
walls
house
and
tower
that
shone
in
the
sunlight
and
here
were
the
and
his
wife
delighted
to
see
strange
faces
and
most
hospitably
inclined
insomuch
that
lavender
who
cared
little
for
luncheon
at
any
time
was
constrained
to
take
as
much
bread
and
cheese
and
butter
and
whisky
as
would
have
made
a
dinner
it
was
a
strange
sort
of
a
meal
this
away
out
at
the
end
of
the
world
as
it
were
the
snug
little
room
might
have
been
in
the
marylebone
road
there
were
photographs
about
a
gay
label
on
the
whisky
bottle
and
other
signs
of
an
advanced
civilization
but
outside
nothing
but
the
wild
precipices
of
the
coast
a
surging
sea
that
seemed
almost
to
surround
the
place
the
wild
screaming
of
the
and
a
single
ship
appearing
like
a
mere
speck
on
the
northern
horizon
they
had
not
noticed
the
wind
much
as
they
drove
along
but
now
when
they
went
out
on
the
high
of
rock
it
seemed
to
be
blowing
half
a
gale
across
the
sea
the
sunlight
sparkled
on
the
glass
of
the
lighthouse
and
the
great
yellow
shaft
of
stone
stretched
away
upward
into
a
perfect
blue
as
clear
a
blue
lay
far
beneath
them
when
the
sea
came
rushing
in
among
the
lofty
crags
and
sharp
pinnacles
of
rock
bursting
into
foam
at
their
feet
and
sending
long
jets
of
white
spray
up
into
the
air
in
front
of
the
great
wall
of
rock
the
wheeled
and
screamed
and
on
the
points
of
some
of
the
islands
stood
several
scarts
motionless
figures
of
jet
black
on
the
soft
brown
and
green
of
the
rock
and
what
was
this
island
they
looked
down
upon
from
over
one
of
the
bays
surely
a
mighty
reproduction
by
nature
herself
of
the
sphynx
of
the
egyptian
plains
could
anything
have
been
more
striking
and
unexpected
and
impressive
than
the
sudden
discovery
of
this
great
mass
of
rock
resting
in
the
wild
sea
its
hooded
head
turned
away
toward
the
north
and
hidden
from
the
spectator
on
land
its
gigantic
bulk
surrounded
by
a
foam
of
breakers
lavender
with
his
teeth
set
hard
against
the
wind
must
needs
take
down
the
outlines
of
this
strange
scene
upon
paper
while
sheila
crouched
at
her
side
for
shelter
and
ingram
was
chiefly
engaged
in
holding
on
to
his
cap
blows
here
a
bit
said
lavender
amid
the
roar
of
the
waves
suppose
in
the
the
sea
will
sometimes
break
across
this
place
and
over
the
top
of
the
too
said
mackenzie
with
a
laugh
as
though
he
was
rather
proud
of
the
way
his
native
seas
behaved
said
ingram
never
saw
take
refuge
from
the
wind
is
because
we
will
be
standing
still
said
the
girl
with
a
smile
which
was
scarcely
visible
because
she
had
half
hidden
her
face
in
her
great
gray
beard
when
mr
lavender
is
finished
we
will
go
down
to
the
great
hole
in
the
rocks
that
you
will
have
seen
before
and
perhaps
he
will
make
a
picture
of
that
mean
to
say
you
would
go
down
there
sheila
said
ingram
in
this
wind
have
been
down
many
times
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
sheila
said
her
father
will
go
back
to
the
if
you
like
yes
you
may
do
that
and
i
will
go
down
the
rocks
with
mr
lavender
but
it
iss
not
for
a
young
lady
to
go
about
among
the
rocks
like
a
lad
that
wants
the
eggs
or
such
it
was
quite
evident
that
mackenzie
had
very
little
fear
of
his
daughter
not
being
able
to
accomplish
the
descent
of
the
rocks
safely
enough
it
was
a
matter
of
dignity
and
so
sheila
was
at
length
persuaded
to
go
across
the
plain
to
a
sheltered
place
to
await
there
until
the
others
should
clamber
down
to
the
great
and
tunnel
through
the
rocks
that
the
artist
was
to
sketch
lavender
was
ill
at
ease
he
followed
his
guide
mechanically
as
they
made
their
way
in
zigzag
fashion
down
the
precipitous
slopes
and
over
slippery
plateaus
and
when
at
last
he
came
in
sight
of
the
mighty
arch
the
long
cavern
and
the
glimmer
of
sea
and
shore
that
could
be
seen
through
it
he
began
to
put
down
the
outlines
of
the
picture
as
rapidly
as
possible
but
with
little
interest
in
the
matter
ingram
was
sitting
on
the
bare
rocks
beside
him
mackenzie
was
some
distance
off
should
he
tell
his
friend
of
what
sheila
had
said
in
the
morning
strict
honesty
perhaps
demanded
as
much
but
the
temptation
to
say
nothing
was
great
for
it
was
evident
that
ingram
was
now
well
inclined
to
the
project
and
would
do
his
best
to
help
it
on
whereas
if
once
he
knew
that
sheila
had
resolved
against
it
he
too
might
take
some
sudden
step
such
as
insisting
on
their
immediate
return
to
the
midland
which
would
settle
the
matter
forever
sheila
had
said
she
would
herself
make
the
necessary
explanation
to
ingram
but
she
had
not
done
so
perhaps
she
might
lack
the
courage
or
an
opportunity
to
do
so
and
in
the
meantime
was
not
the
interval
altogether
favorable
to
his
chances
doubtless
she
was
a
little
frightened
at
first
she
would
soon
get
less
timid
and
would
relent
and
revoke
her
decision
of
the
morning
he
would
not
at
present
at
any
rate
say
anything
to
ingram
but
when
they
had
got
up
again
to
the
summit
of
the
rocks
an
incident
occurred
that
considerably
startled
him
out
of
these
vague
and
anxious
speculations
he
walked
straight
over
to
the
sheltered
spot
in
which
sheila
was
waiting
the
rushing
of
the
wind
doubtless
drowned
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
so
that
he
came
on
her
unawares
and
on
seeing
him
she
rose
suddenly
from
the
rock
on
which
she
had
been
sitting
with
some
effort
to
hide
her
face
away
from
him
but
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
in
her
eyes
that
filled
him
with
remorse
he
said
going
forward
to
her
is
the
matter
what
are
you
unhappy
about
she
could
not
answer
she
held
her
face
turned
from
him
and
cast
down
and
then
seeing
her
father
and
ingram
in
the
distance
she
set
out
to
follow
them
to
the
lighthouse
lavender
walking
by
her
side
and
wondering
how
he
could
deal
with
the
distress
that
was
only
too
clearly
written
on
her
face
know
it
is
i
who
have
grieved
you
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
am
very
sorry
but
if
you
will
tell
me
what
i
can
do
to
remove
this
unhappiness
i
will
do
it
now
shall
i
consider
our
talking
together
of
last
night
as
if
it
had
not
taken
place
at
all
she
said
in
as
low
a
voice
but
clear
and
sad
and
determined
in
its
tone
i
shall
speak
no
more
to
you
about
this
affair
until
i
go
away
altogether
and
again
she
signified
her
assent
gravely
and
firmly
then
he
said
will
soon
forget
all
about
it
for
of
course
i
shall
never
come
back
to
lewis
the
word
had
escaped
her
unwillingly
and
it
was
accompanied
by
a
quick
upturning
of
the
face
and
a
frightened
look
in
the
beautiful
eyes
you
wish
me
to
come
back
he
said
should
not
wish
you
to
go
way
from
the
lewis
through
any
fault
of
mine
and
say
that
we
should
never
see
you
again
said
the
girl
in
measured
tones
as
if
she
were
nerving
herself
to
make
the
admission
and
yet
fearful
of
saying
too
much
by
this
time
mackenzie
and
ingram
had
gone
around
the
big
wall
of
the
there
were
no
human
beings
on
this
lonely
bit
of
heath
but
themselves
lavender
stopped
her
and
took
her
hand
and
said
you
see
sheila
how
i
must
never
come
back
to
lewis
if
all
this
is
to
be
forgotten
and
all
i
want
you
to
say
is
that
i
may
come
some
day
to
see
if
you
can
make
up
your
mind
to
be
my
wife
i
ask
that
yet
it
is
out
of
the
question
seeing
how
short
a
time
you
have
known
anything
about
me
and
i
can
not
wish
you
to
trust
me
as
i
can
trust
you
it
is
a
very
little
thing
i
ask
only
to
give
me
a
chance
at
some
future
time
and
then
if
you
care
for
me
sufficiently
to
marry
me
or
if
anything
stands
in
the
way
all
you
need
do
is
to
send
me
a
single
word
and
that
will
suffice
this
is
no
terrible
thing
that
i
beg
from
you
sheila
you
be
afraid
of
but
she
was
afraid
there
was
nothing
but
fear
and
doubt
and
grief
in
her
eyes
as
she
gazed
in
the
unknown
world
laid
open
before
her
you
ask
someone
to
tell
you
that
it
is
nothing
dreadful
ingram
for
example
could
papa
then
he
said
driven
to
this
desperate
resource
by
his
anxiety
to
save
her
from
pain
yet
not
just
yet
she
said
almost
wildly
how
could
i
explain
to
him
he
would
ask
me
what
my
wishes
were
what
could
i
say
i
do
not
know
i
can
not
tell
myself
and
and
i
have
no
mother
to
and
here
all
the
strain
of
gave
way
and
the
girl
burst
into
tears
dear
sheila
he
said
you
trust
your
own
heart
and
let
that
be
your
guide
you
say
this
one
word
and
tell
me
that
i
am
to
come
back
to
lewis
some
day
and
ask
to
see
you
and
get
a
message
from
one
look
of
your
eyes
sheila
may
not
i
come
back
if
there
was
a
reply
it
was
so
low
that
he
scarcely
heard
it
but
somehow
whether
from
the
small
hand
that
lay
in
his
or
from
the
eyes
that
sent
one
brief
message
of
trust
and
hope
through
their
tears
his
question
was
answered
and
from
that
moment
he
felt
no
more
misgivings
but
let
his
love
for
sheila
shine
out
and
blossom
in
whatever
light
of
fancy
and
imagination
he
could
bring
to
bear
on
it
without
any
doubts
as
to
the
future
how
the
young
fellow
laughed
and
joked
as
the
party
drove
away
again
from
the
butt
down
the
long
to
barvas
he
was
tenderly
respectful
and
a
little
moderate
in
tone
when
he
addressed
sheila
but
with
the
others
he
gave
way
to
a
wild
exuberance
of
spirits
that
delighted
mackenzie
beyond
measure
he
told
stories
of
the
odd
old
gentlemen
of
his
club
of
their
opinions
their
ways
their
dress
he
sang
the
song
of
the
arethusa
and
the
wilds
of
lewis
echoed
with
a
chorus
which
was
not
just
as
harmonious
as
it
might
have
been
he
sang
the
of
punch
and
mackenzie
said
that
was
a
teffle
of
a
good
song
he
gave
imitations
of
some
of
companions
at
the
board
of
trade
and
showed
sheila
what
the
inside
of
a
government
office
was
like
he
paid
mackenzie
the
compliment
of
asking
him
for
a
drop
of
something
out
of
his
flask
and
in
return
he
insisted
on
the
king
smoking
a
cigar
which
in
point
of
age
and
sweetness
and
fragrance
was
really
the
sort
of
a
cigar
you
would
naturally
give
to
the
man
whose
only
daughter
you
wanted
to
marry
ingram
understood
all
this
and
was
pleased
to
see
the
happy
look
that
sheila
wore
he
talked
to
her
with
even
a
greater
assumption
than
usual
of
fatherly
fondness
and
if
she
was
a
little
shy
was
it
not
because
she
was
conscious
of
so
great
a
secret
he
was
even
unusually
complaisant
to
lavender
and
lost
no
opportunity
of
paying
him
indirect
compliments
that
sheila
could
overhear
poor
young
things
he
seemed
to
be
saying
to
himself
got
all
your
troubles
before
you
but
in
the
meantime
you
can
make
yourselves
as
happy
as
you
was
the
weather
at
last
about
to
break
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
the
heavens
became
overcast
for
the
wind
had
gone
back
from
the
course
of
the
sun
and
had
brought
up
great
masses
of
cloud
from
the
rainy
southwest
we
going
to
have
a
storm
said
lavender
looking
along
the
southern
sky
where
the
barvas
hills
were
momentarily
growing
blacker
under
the
gathering
darkness
overhead
said
mackenzie
whose
notions
of
what
constituted
a
storm
were
probably
different
from
those
of
his
guest
there
will
be
no
storm
but
it
is
no
bad
thing
if
we
get
back
to
barvas
very
duncan
sent
the
horses
on
and
ingram
looked
out
and
the
rugs
the
southern
sky
certainly
looked
ominous
there
was
a
strange
intensity
of
color
in
the
dark
landscape
from
the
deep
purple
of
the
barvas
hills
coming
forward
to
the
deep
green
of
the
around
them
and
the
rich
reds
and
browns
of
the
heather
and
the
at
one
point
of
the
clouded
and
hurrying
sky
however
there
was
a
soft
and
vaporous
line
of
yellow
in
the
gray
and
under
that
miles
away
in
the
west
a
great
dash
of
silver
light
struck
upon
the
sea
and
glowed
there
so
that
the
eye
could
scarcely
bear
it
was
it
the
damp
that
brought
the
perfumes
of
the
moorlands
so
distinctly
toward
them
the
the
and
the
wild
thyme
there
were
no
birds
to
be
heard
the
crimson
masses
of
heather
on
the
gray
rocks
seemed
to
have
grown
richer
and
deeper
in
color
and
the
barvas
hills
had
become
large
and
weird
in
the
gloom
you
afraid
of
thunder
said
lavender
to
sheila
said
the
girl
looking
frankly
toward
him
with
her
glad
eyes
as
though
he
had
pleased
her
by
asking
that
not
very
striking
question
and
then
she
looked
around
at
the
sea
and
the
sky
in
the
south
and
said
quietly
there
will
be
no
thunder
it
is
too
much
ingram
with
a
smile
which
he
could
scarcely
conceal
hereupon
remarked
sorry
lavender
i
know
you
like
to
shelter
somebody
in
danger
or
attempt
a
rescue
or
do
something
heroic
mr
lavender
would
do
that
if
there
was
any
need
said
the
girl
bravely
then
it
would
be
nothing
to
laugh
you
bad
girl
how
dare
you
talk
like
that
to
me
said
ingram
and
he
put
his
arm
within
hers
and
said
he
would
tell
her
a
story
but
this
race
to
escape
the
storm
was
needless
for
they
were
just
getting
within
sight
of
barvas
when
a
surprising
change
came
over
the
dark
and
thunderous
afternoon
the
hurrying
masses
of
cloud
in
the
west
parted
for
a
little
space
and
there
was
a
sudden
and
fitful
glimmer
of
a
stormy
blue
sky
then
a
strange
soft
yellow
and
vaporous
light
shone
across
to
the
barvas
hills
and
touched
up
palely
the
great
slopes
rendering
them
distant
ethereal
and
then
a
shaft
or
two
of
wild
light
flashed
down
upon
the
landscape
beside
them
the
cattle
shone
red
in
the
brilliant
green
pastures
the
gray
rocks
glowed
in
their
setting
of
moss
the
stream
going
by
barvas
inn
was
a
streak
of
gold
in
its
sandy
bed
and
then
the
sky
above
them
broke
into
great
billows
of
cloud
tempestuous
and
rounded
masses
of
golden
vapor
that
burned
with
the
wild
glare
of
the
sunset
the
clear
spaces
in
the
sky
widened
and
from
time
to
time
the
wind
sent
ragged
bits
of
yellow
cloud
across
the
shining
blue
all
the
world
seemed
to
be
on
fire
and
the
very
smoke
of
it
the
majestic
masses
of
vapor
that
rolled
by
overhead
burned
with
a
bewildering
glare
then
as
the
wind
still
blew
hard
and
kept
veering
around
to
the
northwest
the
clouds
were
driven
over
one
by
one
leaving
a
pale
and
serene
sky
to
look
down
on
the
sinking
sun
and
the
sea
the
atlantic
caught
the
yellow
glow
on
its
tumbling
waves
and
a
deeper
color
stole
across
the
slopes
and
peaks
of
the
barvas
hills
whither
had
gone
the
storm
there
were
still
some
banks
of
clouds
away
up
in
the
northeast
and
in
the
clear
green
of
the
evening
sky
they
had
their
distant
grays
and
purples
faintly
tinged
with
rose
so
you
are
anxious
and
frightened
and
a
little
pleased
said
ingram
to
sheila
that
evening
after
he
had
frankly
told
her
what
he
knew
and
invited
her
further
confidence
is
all
i
can
gather
from
you
but
it
is
enough
now
you
can
leave
the
rest
to
you
said
the
girl
with
a
blush
of
pleasure
and
surprise
i
like
new
experiences
i
am
going
to
become
an
intermeddler
now
i
am
going
to
arrange
this
affair
and
become
the
negotiator
between
all
the
parties
and
then
when
i
have
secured
the
happiness
of
the
whole
of
you
you
will
all
set
upon
me
and
beat
me
with
sticks
and
thrust
me
out
of
your
do
not
think
said
sheila
looking
down
you
need
have
much
fear
of
that
the
world
going
to
alter
because
of
me
would
rather
not
have
you
try
to
do
anything
that
is
likely
to
get
you
into
unhappiness
she
said
but
that
is
absurd
you
timid
young
folks
act
for
yourselves
you
want
agents
and
instruments
that
have
got
hardened
by
use
fancy
the
condition
of
our
ancestors
you
know
before
they
had
the
sense
to
invent
steel
claws
to
tear
their
food
in
pieces
what
could
they
do
with
their
fingers
i
am
going
to
be
your
knife
and
fork
sheila
and
see
what
i
shall
carve
out
for
you
all
got
to
do
is
to
keep
your
spirits
up
and
believe
that
nothing
dreadful
is
going
to
take
place
merely
because
some
day
you
will
be
asked
to
marry
you
let
things
take
their
ordinary
course
keep
your
spirits
up
neglect
your
music
or
your
dinner
or
your
poor
people
down
in
borvapost
and
see
it
will
all
come
right
enough
in
a
year
or
two
or
less
than
that
you
will
marry
contentedly
and
happily
and
your
papa
will
drink
a
good
glass
of
whisky
at
the
wedding
and
make
jokes
about
it
and
everything
will
be
as
right
as
the
mail
my
advice
see
you
attend
to
are
very
kind
to
me
said
the
girl
in
a
low
voice
if
you
begin
to
cry
sheila
then
i
throw
up
my
duties
do
you
hear
now
look
there
goes
mr
lavender
down
to
the
boat
with
a
bundle
of
rugs
and
i
suppose
you
mean
me
to
imperil
my
precious
life
by
sailing
about
these
rocky
channels
in
the
moonlight
come
along
down
to
the
shore
and
mind
you
please
your
papa
by
singing
in
thine
with
mr
lavender
and
if
you
would
add
to
that
minute
gun
at
sea
why
you
know
i
may
as
well
have
my
little
rewards
for
intermeddling
now
as
i
shall
have
to
suffer
through
me
said
sheila
in
rather
an
uncertain
voice
and
then
they
went
down
to
the
part
iv
chapter
viii
terque
quaterque
beate
consider
what
a
task
this
unhappy
man
ingram
had
voluntarily
undertaken
here
were
two
young
people
presumably
in
love
one
of
them
was
laid
under
suspicion
by
several
previous
love
affairs
though
none
of
these
doubtless
had
been
so
serious
as
the
present
the
other
scarcely
knew
her
own
mind
or
perhaps
was
afraid
to
question
herself
too
closely
lest
all
the
conflict
between
duty
and
inclination
with
its
fears
and
anxieties
and
troubles
should
be
too
suddenly
revealed
moreover
this
girl
was
the
only
daughter
of
a
solitary
and
irascible
old
gentleman
living
in
a
remote
island
and
ingram
had
not
only
undertaken
that
the
love
affairs
of
the
young
folks
should
come
all
right
thus
assuming
a
responsibility
which
might
have
appalled
the
bravest
but
was
also
expected
to
inform
the
king
of
borva
that
his
daughter
was
about
to
be
taken
away
from
him
of
course
if
sheila
had
been
a
properly
brought
up
young
lady
nothing
of
this
sort
would
have
been
necessary
we
all
know
what
the
properly
brought
up
young
lady
does
under
such
circumstances
she
goes
straight
to
her
papa
and
mamma
and
says
dear
papa
and
mamma
i
have
been
taught
by
my
various
instructors
that
i
ought
to
have
no
secrets
from
my
dear
parents
and
i
therefore
hasten
to
lay
aside
any
little
shyness
or
modesty
or
doubt
of
my
own
wishes
i
might
feel
for
the
purpose
of
explaining
to
you
the
extent
to
which
i
have
become
a
victim
to
the
tender
passion
and
of
soliciting
your
advice
i
also
place
before
you
these
letters
i
have
received
from
the
gentleman
in
question
probably
they
were
sent
in
confidence
to
me
but
i
must
banish
any
scruples
that
do
not
coincide
with
my
duty
to
you
i
may
say
that
i
respect
and
even
admire
and
i
should
be
unworthy
of
the
care
bestowed
upon
my
education
by
my
dear
parents
if
i
were
altogether
insensible
to
the
advantages
of
his
worldly
position
but
beyond
this
point
i
am
at
a
loss
to
define
my
sentiments
and
so
i
ask
you
my
dear
papa
and
mamma
for
permission
to
study
the
question
for
some
little
time
longer
when
i
may
be
able
to
furnish
you
with
a
more
accurate
report
of
my
feelings
at
the
same
time
if
the
interest
i
have
in
this
young
man
is
likely
to
conflict
with
the
duty
i
owe
to
my
dear
parents
i
ask
to
be
informed
of
the
fact
and
i
shall
then
teach
myself
to
guard
against
the
approach
of
that
insidious
passion
which
might
make
me
indifferent
to
the
higher
calls
and
interests
of
happy
the
man
who
marries
such
a
woman
no
agonizing
quarrels
and
delirious
reconciliations
no
piteous
entreaties
and
fits
of
remorse
and
impetuous
await
him
but
a
beautiful
methodical
placid
life
as
calm
and
accurate
and
steadily
progressive
as
the
multiplication
table
his
household
will
be
a
miracle
of
perfect
arrangement
the
relations
between
the
members
of
it
will
be
as
strictly
defined
as
the
pattern
of
the
paper
on
the
walls
and
how
can
a
quarrel
arise
when
a
dissecter
of
the
emotions
is
close
at
hand
to
say
where
the
divergence
of
opinion
or
interest
began
and
how
can
a
fit
of
jealousy
be
provoked
in
the
case
of
a
person
who
will
split
up
her
affections
into
fifteen
parts
give
to
her
children
to
her
parents
and
the
remainder
to
her
husband
should
there
be
any
dismal
fractions
going
about
friends
and
acquaintances
may
come
in
for
them
but
how
was
sheila
to
go
to
her
father
and
explain
to
him
what
she
could
not
explain
to
herself
she
had
never
dreamed
of
marriage
she
had
never
thought
of
having
to
leave
borva
and
her
house
but
she
had
some
vague
feeling
that
in
the
future
lay
many
terrible
possibilities
that
she
did
not
as
yet
dare
to
look
at
until
at
least
she
was
more
satisfied
as
to
the
present
and
how
could
she
go
to
her
father
with
such
a
chaos
of
unformed
wishes
and
fears
to
place
before
him
that
such
a
duty
should
have
devolved
upon
ingram
was
certainly
odd
enough
but
it
was
not
her
doing
his
knowledge
of
the
position
of
these
young
people
was
not
derived
from
her
but
having
got
it
he
had
himself
asked
her
to
leave
the
whole
affair
in
his
hands
with
that
kindness
and
generosity
which
had
more
than
once
filled
her
heart
with
an
unspeakable
gratitude
toward
him
you
a
good
fellow
said
lavender
to
him
when
he
heard
of
this
decision
said
the
other
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
mean
to
amuse
myself
i
shall
move
you
about
like
pieces
on
a
and
have
a
pretty
game
with
you
how
to
checkmate
the
king
with
a
knight
and
a
princess
in
any
number
of
moves
you
like
that
is
the
problem
and
my
princess
has
a
strong
power
over
the
king
where
she
is
just
an
uncommonly
awkward
business
you
know
ingram
said
lavender
ruefully
it
is
old
mackenzie
is
a
tough
old
fellow
to
deal
with
and
do
no
good
by
making
a
fight
of
it
wait
difficulties
look
so
formidable
when
you
take
them
one
by
one
as
they
turn
up
if
you
really
love
the
girl
and
mean
to
take
your
chance
of
getting
her
and
if
she
cares
enough
for
you
to
sacrifice
a
good
deal
for
your
sake
there
is
nothing
to
can
answer
for
myself
anyway
said
lavender
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
ingram
rather
liked
the
young
man
did
not
always
speak
with
the
same
quietness
thoughtfulness
and
modesty
and
how
naturally
and
easily
it
came
about
after
all
they
were
back
again
at
borva
they
had
driven
around
and
about
lewis
and
had
finished
up
with
stornoway
and
now
that
they
had
got
back
to
the
island
in
loch
roag
the
quaint
little
had
even
to
lavender
a
homely
and
friendly
look
the
big
stuffed
fishes
and
the
sponge
shells
were
old
acquaintances
and
he
went
to
hunt
up
music
just
as
if
he
had
known
that
dusky
corner
for
years
yes
called
mackenzie
iss
the
english
songs
we
will
try
he
had
a
notion
that
he
was
himself
rather
a
good
hand
at
a
part
song
just
as
sheila
had
innocently
taught
him
to
believe
that
he
was
a
brilliant
whist
player
when
he
had
mastered
the
art
of
returning
his
lead
but
fortunately
at
this
moment
he
was
engaged
with
a
long
pipe
and
a
big
tumbler
of
hot
whisky
and
water
ingram
was
similarly
employed
lying
back
in
a
and
placidly
watching
the
smoke
ascending
to
the
roof
sometimes
he
cast
an
eye
to
the
young
folks
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
they
formed
a
pretty
sight
he
thought
lavender
was
a
fellow
enough
and
there
was
something
pleasing
in
the
quiet
and
assiduous
fashion
in
which
he
waited
upon
sheila
and
in
the
almost
timid
way
in
which
he
spoke
to
her
sheila
herself
sat
at
the
piano
clad
all
in
silk
with
a
narrow
band
of
scarlet
velvet
around
her
neck
and
it
was
only
by
a
chance
turning
of
the
head
that
ingram
caught
the
tender
and
handsome
profile
broken
only
by
the
onward
sweep
of
the
long
eyelashes
in
thine
eyes
for
ever
plays
sheila
sang
with
her
father
keeping
time
by
patting
his
forefinger
on
the
table
in
thy
snowy
bosom
strays
sang
lavender
and
then
the
two
voices
joined
together
makes
thy
rosy
lips
his
care
and
walks
the
mazes
of
thy
or
were
there
not
three
voices
surely
from
the
back
part
of
the
room
the
musicians
could
hear
a
wandering
bass
come
in
from
time
to
time
especially
at
such
portions
as
he
never
ah
he
never
touched
thy
heart
which
old
mackenzie
considered
very
touching
but
there
was
something
quaint
and
friendly
and
pleasant
in
the
pathos
of
those
english
songs
which
made
them
far
more
acceptable
to
him
than
wild
and
melancholy
legends
of
the
sea
he
sang
he
never
never
touched
thy
heart
with
an
outward
expression
of
grief
but
with
much
inward
satisfaction
was
it
the
quaint
phraseology
of
the
old
duets
that
awoke
in
him
some
faint
ambition
after
histrionic
effect
at
all
events
sheila
proceeded
to
another
of
his
favorites
well
and
here
amid
the
brisk
music
the
old
man
had
an
excellent
opportunity
of
striking
in
at
random
the
careful
watch
patrols
the
deck
to
guard
the
ship
from
foes
or
wreck
these
two
lines
he
had
absolutely
mastered
and
always
sang
them
whatever
might
be
the
key
he
happened
to
light
on
with
great
vigor
he
soon
went
to
the
length
of
improvising
a
part
for
himself
in
the
closing
passages
and
laid
down
his
pipe
altogether
as
he
sang
what
cheer
brother
quickly
tell
above
below
all
well
from
that
point
however
sheila
and
her
companion
wandered
away
into
fields
of
melody
whither
the
king
of
borva
could
not
follow
them
so
he
was
content
to
resume
his
pipe
and
listen
placidly
to
the
pretty
airs
he
caught
but
bits
and
fragments
of
phrases
and
sentiments
but
they
evidently
were
comfortable
merry
songs
for
the
young
folks
to
sing
there
was
a
good
deal
of
and
rosy
morns
appearing
and
merry
zephyrs
and
such
odd
things
which
sung
briskly
and
gladly
by
two
young
and
fresh
voices
rather
drew
the
hearts
of
contemplative
listeners
to
the
musicians
sing
very
well
whatever
said
mackenzie
with
a
critical
air
to
ingram
when
the
young
people
were
so
busily
engaged
with
their
own
affairs
as
apparently
to
forget
the
presence
of
the
others
yes
they
sing
very
well
whatever
and
what
should
the
young
folks
sing
about
but
making
love
and
courting
and
all
that
enough
said
ingram
looking
rather
wistfully
at
the
two
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
suppose
sheila
will
have
a
sweetheart
some
day
yes
sheila
will
hef
a
sweetheart
some
day
said
her
father
is
a
girl
she
will
hef
a
sweetheart
some
will
be
marrying
too
i
suppose
said
ingram
cautiously
yes
she
will
marry
sheila
will
marry
what
will
be
the
life
of
a
young
girl
if
she
does
not
marry
at
this
moment
as
ingram
afterward
described
it
a
sort
of
of
darted
in
upon
him
and
he
resolved
there
and
then
to
brave
the
wrath
of
the
old
king
and
place
all
the
conspiracy
before
him
if
only
the
music
kept
loud
enough
to
prevent
his
being
overheard
will
be
hard
on
you
to
part
with
sheila
when
she
marries
said
ingram
scarcely
daring
to
look
up
ay
it
will
be
that
said
mackenzie
cheerfully
enough
it
iss
every
one
will
hef
to
do
that
and
no
great
harm
comes
of
it
oh
no
it
will
not
be
much
whatever
and
sheila
she
will
be
very
glad
in
a
little
while
after
and
it
will
be
enough
for
me
to
see
that
she
is
ferry
contented
and
happy
the
young
folk
must
marry
you
will
see
and
what
is
the
use
of
marrying
if
it
is
not
when
they
are
young
but
sheila
she
will
think
of
none
of
these
things
it
was
young
macintyre
of
sutherland
you
hef
seen
him
last
year
in
stornoway
he
has
three
thousand
acres
of
a
deer
forest
in
sutherland
and
he
will
be
ferry
glad
to
marry
my
sheila
but
i
will
say
to
him
is
not
for
me
to
say
yes
or
no
to
you
macintyre
it
is
sheila
herself
will
tell
you
but
he
was
afraid
to
speak
to
her
and
sheila
herself
will
know
nothing
of
why
he
came
twice
to
borva
the
last
is
very
good
of
you
to
leave
sheila
quite
unbiased
in
her
choice
said
ingram
fathers
would
have
been
sorely
tempted
by
that
deer
old
mackenzie
laughed
a
loud
laugh
of
derision
that
fortunately
did
not
stop
execution
of
would
that
my
love
would
the
teffle
said
mackenzie
i
to
want
a
deer
forest
for
my
sheila
sheila
is
no
lass
she
has
plenty
for
herself
and
she
will
marry
just
the
young
man
she
wants
to
marry
and
no
other
one
that
is
what
she
will
do
by
kott
all
this
was
most
hopeful
if
mackenzie
had
himself
been
advocating
suit
could
he
have
said
more
but
notwithstanding
all
these
frank
and
generous
promises
dealing
with
a
future
which
the
old
man
considered
as
indefinitely
remote
ingram
was
still
afraid
of
the
announcement
he
was
about
to
make
is
fortunately
situated
he
said
having
a
father
who
thinks
only
of
her
happiness
but
i
suppose
she
has
never
yet
shown
a
preference
for
any
one
for
any
one
but
yourself
said
her
father
with
a
laugh
and
ingram
laughed
too
but
in
an
embarrassed
way
and
his
sallow
face
grew
darker
with
a
blush
was
there
not
something
painful
in
the
unintentional
implication
that
of
course
ingram
could
not
be
considered
a
possible
lover
of
and
that
the
girl
herself
was
so
well
aware
of
it
that
she
could
openly
testify
to
her
regard
for
him
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
sheila
continued
her
father
more
gravely
there
was
any
young
man
about
the
lewis
that
she
would
tek
a
liking
to
for
it
will
be
some
day
i
can
no
more
look
after
her
and
it
would
be
bad
for
her
to
be
left
alone
all
by
herself
in
the
you
think
you
see
before
you
now
some
one
who
might
take
on
him
the
charge
of
future
said
ingram
looking
toward
lavender
english
gentleman
said
mackenzie
with
a
smile
that
anyway
is
not
fancy
it
is
more
than
possible
said
ingram
resolved
to
go
straight
at
it
know
for
a
fact
that
he
would
like
to
marry
your
daughter
and
i
think
that
sheila
without
knowing
it
herself
almost
is
well
inclined
toward
the
old
man
started
up
from
his
chair
what
my
sheila
papa
said
the
girl
turning
around
at
once
she
caught
sight
of
a
strange
look
on
his
face
and
in
an
instant
was
by
his
side
what
is
the
matter
with
you
sheila
nothing
he
said
impatiently
am
a
little
tired
of
the
music
that
is
all
but
go
on
with
the
music
go
back
to
the
piano
sheila
and
go
on
with
the
music
and
ingram
and
me
we
will
go
outside
for
a
little
mackenzie
walked
out
of
the
room
and
said
aloud
in
the
hall
are
you
coming
ingram
it
iss
a
fine
night
this
night
and
the
wind
is
in
a
very
good
way
for
the
and
then
as
he
went
out
to
the
front
he
hummed
aloud
so
that
sheila
should
hear
who
goes
there
stranger
quickly
tell
a
friend
the
word
well
well
well
ingram
followed
the
old
man
outside
with
a
somewhat
guilty
conscience
suggesting
odd
things
to
him
would
it
not
be
possible
now
to
shut
ears
for
the
next
half
hour
angry
words
were
only
little
perturbations
in
the
air
if
you
shut
your
ears
till
they
were
all
over
what
harm
could
be
done
all
the
big
facts
of
life
would
remain
the
same
the
sea
the
sky
the
hills
the
human
beings
around
you
even
your
desire
of
sleep
for
the
night
and
your
wholesome
longing
for
breakfast
in
the
morning
would
all
remain
and
the
angry
words
would
have
passed
away
but
perhaps
it
was
a
proper
punishment
that
he
should
now
go
out
and
bear
all
the
wrath
of
this
fierce
old
gentleman
whose
daughter
he
had
conspired
to
carry
off
mackenzie
was
walking
up
and
down
the
path
outside
in
the
cool
and
silent
night
there
was
not
much
moon
now
but
a
clear
and
lambent
twilight
showed
all
the
familiar
features
of
loch
roag
and
the
southern
hills
and
down
there
in
the
bay
you
could
vaguely
make
out
the
rocking
in
the
tiny
waves
that
washed
in
on
the
white
shore
ingram
had
never
looked
on
this
pretty
picture
with
a
less
feeling
of
delight
you
see
mackenzie
he
was
beginning
must
make
this
excuse
for
him
but
mackenzie
put
aside
lavender
at
once
it
was
all
about
sheila
that
he
wanted
to
know
there
was
no
anger
in
his
words
only
a
great
anxiety
and
sometimes
an
extraordinary
and
pathetic
effort
to
take
a
philosophical
view
of
the
situation
what
had
sheila
said
was
sheila
deeply
interested
in
the
young
man
would
it
please
sheila
if
he
was
to
go
and
give
at
once
his
free
consent
to
her
marrying
this
mr
lavender
you
must
not
think
said
mackenzie
with
a
certain
loftiness
of
air
even
amidst
his
great
perturbation
and
anxiety
must
not
think
i
hef
not
foreseen
all
this
it
wass
some
day
or
other
sheila
will
be
sure
to
marry
and
although
i
did
not
expect
no
i
did
not
expect
that
she
would
marry
a
stranger
and
an
englishman
if
it
will
please
her
that
is
enough
you
can
not
tell
a
young
lass
the
one
she
should
marry
it
iss
all
a
chance
the
one
she
likes
and
if
she
does
not
marry
him
it
is
better
she
will
not
marry
at
all
oh
yes
i
know
that
ferry
well
and
i
hef
known
there
wass
a
time
coming
when
i
would
give
away
my
sheila
to
some
young
man
and
there
iss
no
use
complaining
of
it
but
you
hef
not
told
me
much
about
this
young
man
or
i
hef
forgotten
it
is
the
same
thing
whatever
he
has
not
much
money
you
said
he
is
waiting
for
some
money
well
this
is
what
i
will
do
i
will
give
him
all
my
money
if
he
will
come
and
live
in
the
all
the
philosophy
he
had
been
mustering
up
fell
away
from
that
last
sentence
it
was
like
the
cry
of
a
drowning
man
who
sees
the
last
lifeboat
set
out
for
shore
leaving
him
to
his
fate
and
ingram
had
not
a
word
to
say
in
reply
to
that
piteous
entreaty
do
not
ask
him
to
stop
in
borva
no
it
iss
a
small
place
for
one
that
hass
lived
in
a
town
but
the
lewis
that
is
quite
different
and
there
iss
very
good
houses
in
surely
sir
said
ingram
need
not
consider
all
this
just
yet
i
am
sure
neither
of
them
has
thought
any
such
said
mackenzie
recovering
himself
not
but
we
hef
our
duties
to
look
at
the
future
of
young
folks
and
you
will
say
that
mr
lavender
hass
only
expectations
of
money
the
expectation
is
almost
a
certainty
his
aunt
i
have
told
you
is
a
very
rich
old
lady
who
has
no
other
near
relations
and
she
is
extremely
fond
of
him
and
would
do
anything
for
him
i
am
sure
the
allowance
he
has
now
is
greatly
in
excels
of
what
she
spends
on
they
might
quarrel
you
know
they
might
quarrel
you
hef
always
to
look
to
the
future
they
might
quarrel
and
what
will
he
do
then
you
suppose
he
support
himself
if
the
worst
were
to
come
to
the
worst
he
is
an
amazingly
clever
fellow
that
is
very
good
said
mackenzie
in
a
cautious
sort
of
way
has
he
ever
made
any
money
i
fancy
not
nothing
to
speak
of
he
has
sold
some
pictures
but
i
think
he
has
given
more
it
iss
not
easy
tek
my
word
for
it
ingram
to
begin
a
new
trade
when
you
are
years
of
age
and
the
people
who
will
tek
your
pictures
for
nothing
will
they
pay
for
them
if
you
wanted
the
money
it
was
obviously
the
old
eager
wish
to
prove
to
himself
that
somehow
or
other
lavender
might
come
to
have
no
money
and
be
made
dependent
on
his
so
far
indeed
from
sharing
the
sentiments
ordinarily
attributed
to
that
important
relative
he
would
have
welcomed
with
a
heartfelt
joy
the
information
that
the
man
who
as
he
expected
was
about
to
marry
his
daughter
was
absolutely
penniless
not
even
all
the
attractions
of
that
deer
forest
in
sutherlandshire
particularly
fascinating
as
they
must
have
been
to
a
man
of
his
education
and
surroundings
had
been
able
to
lead
the
old
king
of
borva
even
into
hinting
to
his
daughter
that
the
owner
of
that
property
would
like
to
marry
her
sheila
was
to
choose
for
herself
she
was
not
like
a
lass
bound
to
consider
ways
and
means
and
now
that
she
had
chosen
or
at
least
indicated
the
possibility
of
her
doing
so
her
chief
desire
was
that
his
future
should
come
and
take
and
enjoy
his
money
so
only
that
sheila
might
not
be
carried
away
from
him
forever
i
will
see
about
it
said
mackenzie
with
an
affectation
of
cheerful
and
practical
shrewdness
yes
i
will
see
about
it
when
sheila
has
made
up
her
mind
he
is
a
very
good
young
man
whatever
is
the
fellow
i
know
said
ingram
warmly
think
sheila
has
much
to
fear
if
she
marries
him
if
you
had
known
him
as
long
as
i
have
you
would
know
how
considerate
he
is
to
everybody
about
him
how
generous
he
is
how
and
cheerful
and
so
forth
in
short
he
is
a
thorough
good
fellow
and
what
i
have
to
say
about
iss
well
for
him
he
will
hef
such
a
champion
said
mackenzie
with
a
smile
is
not
many
sheila
will
pay
attention
to
as
she
does
to
they
went
indoors
again
ingram
scarcely
knowing
how
he
had
got
so
easily
through
the
ordeal
but
very
glad
it
was
over
sheila
was
still
at
the
piano
and
on
their
entering
she
said
here
is
a
song
you
must
learn
to
sing
with
what
iss
it
sheila
he
said
going
over
to
her
has
not
thinned
my
flowing
he
put
his
hand
on
her
head
and
said
hope
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
he
will
thin
your
hair
the
girl
looked
up
surprised
scotch
folks
are
as
a
rule
somewhat
reticent
in
their
display
of
affection
and
it
was
not
often
that
her
father
talked
to
her
in
that
way
what
was
there
in
his
face
that
made
her
glance
instinctively
toward
ingram
somehow
or
other
her
hand
sought
her
hand
and
she
rose
and
went
away
from
the
piano
with
her
head
bent
down
and
tears
beginning
to
tell
in
her
eyes
that
is
a
capital
song
said
ingram
loudly
arethusa
lavender
the
saucy
lavender
knowing
what
had
taken
place
and
not
daring
to
follow
with
his
eyes
sheila
and
her
father
who
had
gone
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
sang
the
song
never
was
a
gallant
and
sung
so
hopelessly
without
spirit
but
the
piano
made
a
noise
and
the
verses
took
up
time
when
he
had
finished
he
almost
feared
to
turn
around
and
yet
there
was
nothing
dreadful
in
the
picture
that
presented
itself
sheila
was
sitting
on
her
knee
with
her
head
buried
in
his
bosom
while
he
was
patting
her
head
and
talking
in
a
low
voice
to
her
the
king
of
borva
did
not
look
particularly
fierce
it
iss
a
teffle
of
a
good
song
he
said
suddenly
get
up
sheila
and
go
and
tell
mairi
we
will
have
a
bit
of
bread
and
cheese
before
going
to
bed
and
there
will
be
a
little
hot
water
wanted
in
the
other
room
for
this
room
it
iss
too
full
of
the
sheila
as
she
went
out
of
the
room
had
her
head
cast
down
and
perhaps
an
extra
tinge
of
color
in
her
young
and
pretty
face
but
surely
lavender
thought
to
himself
as
he
watched
her
anxiously
she
did
not
look
grieved
as
for
her
father
what
should
he
do
now
turn
suddenly
around
and
beg
pardon
and
throw
himself
on
his
generosity
when
he
did
with
much
inward
trembling
venture
to
approach
the
old
man
he
found
no
such
explanation
possible
the
king
of
borva
was
in
one
of
his
grandest
moods
dignified
courteous
cautious
and
yet
inclined
to
treat
everybody
and
everything
with
a
sort
of
lofty
good
humor
he
spoke
to
lavender
in
the
most
friendly
way
but
it
was
about
the
singular
and
startling
fact
that
modern
research
had
proved
many
of
the
roman
legends
to
be
utterly
untrustworthy
mackenzie
observed
that
the
man
was
wanting
in
proper
courage
who
feared
to
accept
the
results
of
such
inquiries
it
was
better
that
we
should
know
the
truth
and
then
the
kings
who
had
really
made
rome
great
might
emerge
from
the
fog
of
tradition
in
their
proper
shape
there
was
something
quite
sympathetic
in
the
way
he
talked
of
those
sovereigns
whom
the
vulgar
mind
had
clothed
in
mist
lavender
was
sorely
beset
by
the
rival
claims
of
rome
and
borva
upon
his
attention
he
was
inwardly
inclined
to
curse
numa
pompilius
which
would
have
been
ineffectual
when
he
found
that
personage
interfering
with
a
wild
effort
to
discover
why
mackenzie
should
treat
him
in
this
way
and
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
as
he
had
never
said
a
word
to
mackenzie
about
this
affair
it
was
too
much
to
expect
that
father
should
himself
open
the
subject
on
the
contrary
mackenzie
was
bent
on
extending
a
grave
courtesy
to
his
guest
so
that
the
latter
should
not
feel
ill
at
ease
until
it
suited
himself
to
make
any
explanations
he
might
choose
it
was
not
business
to
ask
this
young
man
if
he
wanted
to
marry
sheila
no
the
daughter
if
she
were
to
be
won
at
all
was
to
be
won
by
a
suitor
and
it
was
not
for
her
father
to
be
in
a
hurry
about
it
so
lavender
got
back
into
the
region
of
early
roman
history
and
tried
to
recall
what
he
had
learned
in
livy
and
quite
coincided
with
everything
that
niebuhr
had
said
or
proved
and
with
everything
that
mackenzie
thought
niebuhr
had
said
or
proved
he
was
only
too
glad
indeed
to
find
himself
talking
to
father
in
this
friendly
fashion
then
sheila
came
in
and
told
them
that
supper
was
laid
in
the
adjoining
room
at
that
modest
meal
a
great
good
humor
prevailed
sometimes
it
is
true
it
occurred
to
ingram
that
sheila
occasionally
cast
an
anxious
glance
to
her
father
as
if
she
were
trying
to
discover
whether
he
was
really
satisfied
or
whether
he
were
not
merely
pretending
satisfaction
to
please
her
but
for
the
rest
the
party
was
a
most
friendly
and
merry
one
lavender
naturally
enough
was
in
the
highest
of
spirits
and
nothing
could
exceed
the
endeavors
he
made
to
amuse
and
interest
and
cheer
his
companions
sheila
indeed
sat
up
later
than
usual
even
although
pipes
were
lit
again
and
the
silk
likely
to
bear
witness
to
the
fact
in
the
morning
how
comfortable
and
homely
was
this
sort
of
life
in
the
remote
stone
building
overlooking
the
sea
he
began
to
think
that
he
could
live
always
in
borva
if
only
sheila
were
with
him
as
his
companion
was
it
an
actual
fact
then
he
asked
himself
next
morning
that
he
stood
confessed
to
the
small
world
of
borva
as
accepted
lover
not
a
word
on
the
subject
had
passed
between
mackenzie
and
himself
and
yet
he
found
himself
assuming
the
position
of
a
younger
relative
and
rather
expecting
advice
from
the
old
man
he
began
to
take
a
great
interest
too
in
the
local
administration
of
the
island
he
examined
the
of
house
and
saw
that
they
would
be
useful
in
the
winter
and
expressed
to
father
his
confidential
opinion
that
the
girl
should
not
be
allowed
to
go
out
in
the
without
duncan
will
know
as
much
about
boats
as
duncan
himself
said
her
father
with
a
smile
sheila
will
not
go
out
when
the
rough
weather
course
you
keep
her
indoors
then
said
the
younger
man
already
assuming
some
little
charge
over
comfort
the
father
laughed
aloud
at
this
simplicity
on
the
part
of
the
englishman
we
wass
to
keep
indoors
in
the
bad
weather
it
would
be
all
the
winter
we
would
be
indoors
there
iss
no
day
at
all
sheila
will
not
be
out
some
time
or
other
and
she
is
never
so
well
as
in
the
hard
weather
when
she
will
be
out
always
in
the
snow
and
the
frost
and
hef
plenty
of
exercise
and
is
not
often
ailing
i
suppose
said
lavender
is
as
strong
as
a
young
pony
what
sheila
is
said
her
father
proudly
no
one
in
the
island
will
run
so
fast
or
walk
so
long
without
tiring
or
carry
things
from
the
shore
as
she
will
not
but
here
he
suddenly
checked
himself
is
he
said
with
some
little
expression
of
annoyance
wass
saying
sheila
could
do
that
if
it
wass
any
use
but
she
will
not
do
such
things
like
a
lass
that
hass
to
keep
in
the
of
course
not
said
lavender
hastily
still
you
know
it
is
pleasant
to
know
she
is
so
strong
and
and
at
this
moment
sheila
herself
appeared
accompanied
by
her
great
deerhound
and
testifying
by
the
bright
color
in
her
face
to
the
assurances
of
her
health
her
father
had
been
giving
she
had
just
come
up
and
over
the
hill
at
borvapost
while
as
yet
breakfast
had
not
been
served
somehow
or
other
lavender
fancied
she
never
looked
so
bright
and
bold
and
handsome
as
in
the
early
morning
with
the
fresh
tingling
the
color
of
her
cheeks
and
the
sunlight
shining
in
the
clear
eyes
or
giving
from
time
to
time
a
glimpse
of
her
perfect
teeth
but
this
morning
she
did
not
seem
quite
so
frankly
merry
as
usual
she
patted
her
head
and
rather
kept
her
eyes
away
from
her
father
and
his
companions
and
then
she
took
brass
away
to
give
him
his
breakfast
just
as
ingram
appeared
to
bid
her
and
ask
her
what
she
meant
by
being
about
so
early
how
anxiously
lavender
now
began
to
calculate
on
the
remaining
days
of
their
stay
in
borva
they
seemed
so
few
he
got
up
at
preposterously
early
hours
to
make
each
day
as
long
as
possible
but
it
slipped
away
with
a
fatal
speed
and
already
he
began
to
think
of
stornoway
and
the
clansman
and
his
bidding
to
sheila
he
had
said
no
more
to
her
of
any
pledge
as
regarded
the
future
he
was
content
to
see
that
she
was
pleased
to
be
with
him
and
happy
indeed
were
their
rambles
about
the
island
their
excursions
in
boat
their
visits
to
the
white
water
in
search
of
salmon
nor
had
he
yet
spoken
to
father
he
knew
that
mackenzie
knew
and
both
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
no
good
could
come
of
a
formal
explanation
until
sheila
herself
should
make
her
wishes
known
that
indeed
was
the
only
aspect
of
the
case
that
apparently
presented
itself
to
the
old
king
of
borva
he
forgot
altogether
those
precautions
and
investigations
which
are
supposed
to
occupy
the
mind
of
a
future
and
only
sought
to
see
how
sheila
was
affected
toward
the
young
man
who
was
soon
about
to
leave
the
island
when
he
saw
her
pleased
to
be
walking
with
lavender
and
talking
with
him
of
an
evening
he
was
pleased
and
would
rather
have
a
cold
dinner
than
break
in
upon
them
to
hurry
them
home
when
he
saw
her
disappointed
because
lavender
had
been
unfortunate
in
his
he
was
ready
to
swear
at
duncan
for
not
having
had
the
fish
in
better
temper
and
the
most
of
his
conversation
with
ingram
consisted
of
an
endeavor
to
convince
himself
that
after
all
what
had
happened
was
for
the
best
and
that
sheila
seemed
to
be
happy
but
somehow
or
other
when
the
time
for
their
departure
was
drawing
near
mackenzie
showed
a
strange
desire
that
his
guests
should
spend
the
last
two
days
in
stornoway
when
lavender
first
heard
this
proposal
he
glanced
towards
sheila
and
his
face
showed
clearly
his
disappointment
sheila
will
go
with
us
too
said
her
father
replying
to
that
unuttered
protest
in
the
most
innocent
fashion
and
then
face
brightened
again
and
he
said
that
nothing
would
give
him
greater
pleasure
than
to
spend
two
days
in
stornoway
you
must
not
think
said
mackenzie
anxiously
one
day
or
two
days
or
a
great
many
days
will
show
you
all
the
fine
things
about
stornoway
and
if
you
were
to
live
in
stornoway
you
would
find
very
good
acquaintances
and
friends
there
and
in
the
autumn
when
the
shooting
begins
there
are
many
english
who
will
come
up
and
there
will
be
ferry
great
doings
at
the
castle
and
there
is
some
gentlemen
now
at
grimersta
whom
you
hef
not
seen
and
they
are
ferry
fine
gentlemen
and
at
there
iss
two
more
gentlemen
for
the
oh
there
iss
a
great
many
fine
people
in
the
lewis
and
it
is
not
all
as
lonely
as
it
is
half
as
pleasant
a
place
to
live
in
as
borva
it
will
do
said
lavender
with
a
flush
of
enthusiasm
in
his
face
as
he
looked
toward
sheila
and
saw
her
pleased
and
downcast
eyes
it
iss
not
to
be
compared
said
mackenzie
eagerly
that
is
nothing
at
all
but
the
lewis
it
is
a
ferry
different
thing
to
live
in
the
lewis
and
many
english
gentlemen
hef
told
me
they
would
like
to
live
always
in
the
think
i
should
too
said
lavender
lightly
and
carelessly
little
thinking
what
importance
the
old
man
immediately
and
gladly
put
upon
the
admission
from
that
moment
lavender
though
unconscious
of
what
had
happened
had
nothing
to
fear
in
the
way
of
opposition
from
father
if
he
had
there
and
then
boldly
asked
mackenzie
for
his
daughter
the
old
man
would
have
given
his
consent
freely
and
bade
lavender
to
go
to
sheila
herself
and
so
they
set
sail
one
pleasant
afternoon
from
borvapost
and
the
light
wind
that
ruffled
the
blue
of
loch
roag
gently
filled
the
mainsail
of
the
as
she
lightly
ran
down
the
tortuous
channel
like
to
go
away
from
borva
said
lavender
in
a
low
voice
to
sheila
i
might
have
been
leaving
the
island
with
greater
regret
for
you
know
i
expect
to
be
back
shall
always
be
glad
to
see
you
said
the
girl
although
he
would
rather
have
had
her
say
than
there
was
something
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
that
contented
him
at
mackenzie
pointed
out
with
a
great
interest
to
lavender
a
tall
man
who
was
going
down
through
some
meadows
to
the
amhuinn
dhubh
black
he
had
a
long
rod
over
his
shoulder
and
behind
him
at
some
distance
followed
a
shorter
man
who
carried
a
gaff
and
mackenzie
anxiously
explained
to
lavender
that
the
tall
figure
was
that
of
an
englishman
lavender
accepted
the
statement
but
would
he
not
go
down
to
the
river
and
make
his
acquaintance
lavender
could
not
understand
why
he
should
be
expected
to
take
so
great
an
interest
in
an
ordinary
english
sportsman
well
said
mackenzie
a
trifle
disappointed
you
would
find
several
of
the
english
in
the
lewis
if
you
was
living
these
two
days
in
stornoway
were
very
pleasant
on
their
previous
visit
to
the
town
mackenzie
had
given
up
much
of
his
time
to
business
affairs
and
was
a
good
deal
away
from
his
guests
but
now
he
devoted
himself
to
making
them
particularly
comfortable
in
the
place
and
amusing
them
in
every
possible
way
he
introduced
lavender
in
especial
to
all
his
friends
there
and
was
most
anxious
to
impress
on
the
young
man
that
life
in
stornoway
was
on
the
whole
rather
a
brilliant
affair
then
was
there
a
finer
point
from
which
you
could
start
at
will
for
inverness
oban
and
such
great
centres
of
civilization
very
soon
there
would
even
be
a
telegraphic
cable
laid
to
the
mainland
was
mr
lavender
aware
that
frequently
you
could
see
the
sutherland
hills
from
this
very
town
of
stornoway
there
sheila
laughed
and
lavender
who
kept
watching
her
face
always
to
read
all
her
fancies
and
sentiments
and
wishes
in
the
shifting
lights
of
it
immediately
demanded
an
explanation
is
no
good
thing
said
sheila
see
the
sutherland
hills
often
for
when
you
see
them
it
means
to
but
lavender
had
not
been
taught
to
fear
the
rain
of
the
western
isles
the
weather
seemed
to
have
conspired
with
mackenzie
to
charm
the
young
man
with
the
island
at
this
moment
for
example
they
were
driving
away
from
stornoway
along
the
side
of
the
great
bay
northward
until
it
finds
its
furtherest
promontory
in
tiumpan
head
what
magnificence
of
color
shone
around
them
in
the
hot
sunlight
where
the
ruffled
blue
sea
came
near
the
long
sweep
of
yellow
sand
it
grew
to
a
bright
transparent
green
the
splendid
curve
of
the
bay
showed
a
gleaming
line
of
white
where
the
waves
broke
in
masses
of
hissing
foam
and
beyond
that
curve
again
long
promontories
of
dark
red
conglomerate
ran
out
into
the
darker
waters
of
the
sea
with
their
summits
shining
with
the
bright
here
close
at
hand
were
warm
meadows
with
calves
and
lambs
cropping
the
dutch
clover
a
few
huts
shaped
like
stood
by
the
roadside
close
by
some
deep
peat
cuttings
there
was
a
cutting
in
the
yellow
sand
of
the
bay
for
the
pulling
up
of
the
captured
whales
now
and
then
you
could
see
a
solan
dart
down
from
the
blue
heavens
into
the
deep
blue
of
the
sea
sending
up
a
spurt
of
water
twenty
feet
high
as
he
disappeared
and
far
onward
between
the
red
precipices
and
the
ruffled
waters
herds
of
white
flew
from
crag
to
crag
or
dropped
upon
the
sea
to
rise
and
fall
with
the
waves
at
the
small
hamlet
of
gress
they
got
a
large
manned
by
sturdy
fishermen
and
set
out
to
explore
the
great
caves
formed
in
the
mighty
wall
of
conglomerate
that
here
fronts
the
sea
the
flew
about
them
screaming
and
yelling
at
being
disturbed
the
long
swell
of
the
sea
lifted
the
boat
passed
from
under
it
and
went
on
with
majestic
force
to
crash
on
the
glowing
red
crags
and
send
jets
of
foam
flying
up
the
face
of
them
they
captured
one
of
the
a
young
thing
about
as
big
as
a
hen
with
staring
eyes
scant
feathers
and
a
long
beak
with
which
it
instinctively
tried
to
bite
its
enemies
and
the
parents
of
it
kept
swooping
down
over
the
boat
uttering
shrill
cries
until
their
offspring
was
restored
to
the
surface
of
the
water
they
went
into
the
great
caverns
getting
a
new
impression
of
the
extraordinary
clearness
of
the
by
the
depth
at
which
the
bottom
was
visible
and
here
their
shouts
occasionally
called
up
from
some
dim
twilight
recess
far
in
among
the
perilous
rocks
the
head
of
a
young
seal
which
would
instantly
dive
again
and
be
seen
no
more
they
watched
the
salmon
splash
in
the
shallower
creeks
where
the
sea
had
scooped
out
a
tiny
bay
of
ruddy
sand
and
then
a
slowly
rolling
porpoise
would
show
his
black
back
above
the
water
and
silently
disappear
again
all
this
was
pleasant
enough
on
a
pleasant
morning
in
fresh
and
sunlight
in
holiday
time
and
was
there
any
reason
mackenzie
may
fairly
have
thought
why
this
young
man
if
he
did
marry
sheila
should
not
come
and
live
in
a
place
where
so
much
healthy
amusement
was
to
be
found
and
in
the
evening
too
when
they
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
hills
on
the
south
of
stornoway
harbor
did
not
the
little
town
look
sufficiently
picturesque
with
its
white
houses
its
shipping
its
great
castle
and
plantations
lying
in
shadow
under
the
green
of
the
eastern
sky
then
away
to
the
west
what
a
strange
picture
presented
itself
thick
bands
of
gray
cloud
lay
across
the
sky
and
the
sunlight
from
behind
them
sent
down
great
rays
of
misty
yellow
on
the
endless
miles
of
moor
but
how
was
it
that
as
these
shafts
of
sunlight
struck
on
the
far
and
successive
ridges
of
the
moorland
each
long
undulation
seemed
to
become
transparent
and
all
the
island
appeared
to
consist
of
great
shells
heaped
up
behind
each
other
with
the
sunlight
shining
through
have
tried
a
good
many
new
effects
since
coming
up
here
said
lavender
i
shall
not
try
it
iss
nothing
it
iss
nothing
at
all
said
mackenzie
with
a
stupid
air
of
unconcern
iss
much
more
beautiful
things
than
that
in
the
island
but
you
will
hef
need
of
a
ferry
long
time
before
you
will
find
it
all
out
that
that
iss
nothing
at
will
perhaps
make
a
picture
of
it
some
other
time
said
sheila
with
her
eyes
cast
down
and
as
he
was
standing
by
her
at
the
time
he
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
and
said
hope
then
that
night
did
not
every
hour
produce
some
new
and
wonderful
scene
or
was
it
only
that
each
minute
grew
to
be
so
precious
and
that
the
enchantment
of
presence
filled
the
air
around
him
there
was
no
moon
but
the
stars
shone
over
the
bay
and
the
harbor
and
the
dusky
hills
beyond
the
castle
every
few
seconds
the
at
arnish
point
sent
out
its
wild
glare
of
orange
fire
into
the
heart
of
the
clear
darkness
and
then
as
suddenly
faded
out
and
left
the
eyes
too
bewildered
to
make
out
the
configuration
of
the
rocks
all
over
the
northwest
there
still
remained
the
pale
glow
of
the
twilight
and
somehow
lavender
seemed
to
think
that
that
strange
glow
belonged
to
home
in
the
west
and
that
the
people
in
stornoway
knew
nothing
of
the
wonders
of
loch
roag
and
of
the
nights
there
was
he
likely
ever
to
forget
sheila
he
said
next
morning
when
the
last
signal
had
been
given
and
the
clansman
was
about
to
move
from
her
moorings
she
had
bidden
to
ingram
already
but
somehow
she
could
not
speak
to
his
companion
just
at
this
last
moment
she
pressed
his
hand
and
turned
away
and
went
ashore
with
her
father
then
the
big
steamer
throbbed
its
way
out
of
the
harbor
and
by
and
by
the
island
of
lewis
lay
but
as
a
thin
blue
cloud
along
the
horizon
and
who
could
tell
that
human
beings
with
strange
hopes
and
fancies
and
griefs
were
hidden
away
in
that
pale
line
of
vapor
chapter
ix
mackrimmon
a
night
journey
from
greenock
to
london
is
a
sufficiently
prosaic
affair
in
ordinary
circumstances
but
it
need
not
be
always
so
what
if
a
young
man
apparently
occupied
in
making
himself
comfortable
and
in
talking
nonsense
to
his
friend
and
companion
should
be
secretly
calculating
how
the
journey
could
be
made
most
pleasant
to
a
bride
and
that
bride
his
bride
lavender
made
experiments
with
regard
to
the
ways
and
tempers
of
guards
he
borrowed
planks
of
wood
with
which
to
make
of
an
ordinary
carriage
he
bribed
a
certain
official
to
have
the
compartment
secured
he
took
note
of
the
time
when
and
the
place
where
refreshments
could
be
procured
all
these
things
he
did
thinking
of
sheila
and
when
ingram
sometimes
surprised
by
his
and
occasionally
remonstrating
against
his
extravagance
at
last
fell
asleep
on
the
more
or
less
comfortable
cushions
stretched
across
the
planks
lavender
would
have
him
wake
up
again
that
he
might
be
induced
to
talk
once
more
about
sheila
ingram
would
make
use
of
some
wicked
words
rub
his
eyes
ask
what
was
the
last
station
they
had
passed
and
then
begin
to
preach
to
lavender
about
the
great
obligations
he
was
under
to
sheila
and
what
would
be
expected
of
him
in
after
times
are
coming
away
just
now
he
would
say
while
lavender
who
could
not
sleep
at
all
was
only
anxious
that
name
should
be
mentioned
with
a
greater
treasure
than
falls
to
the
lot
of
most
men
if
you
know
how
to
value
that
treasure
there
is
not
a
king
or
emperor
in
europe
who
should
not
envy
you
think
i
value
it
the
other
would
say
anxiously
see
about
that
afterwards
by
what
you
do
but
in
the
meantime
you
know
what
you
have
won
you
know
the
magnificent
of
that
girl
her
keen
sense
of
honor
nor
the
strength
of
character
of
judgment
and
decision
that
lies
beneath
her
apparent
simplicity
why
i
have
known
sheila
now
but
the
use
of
talking
wish
you
would
talk
though
ingram
said
his
companion
quite
submissively
have
known
her
longer
than
i
am
willing
to
believe
all
you
say
of
her
and
anxious
indeed
to
know
as
much
about
her
as
possible
you
suppose
i
fancy
she
is
anything
less
than
you
say
said
ingram
doubtfully
not
the
worst
of
it
is
that
you
take
such
odd
readings
of
people
however
when
you
marry
her
as
i
now
hope
you
may
you
will
soon
find
out
and
then
if
you
are
not
grateful
if
you
understand
and
appreciate
the
fine
qualities
of
this
girl
the
sooner
you
put
a
millstone
around
your
neck
and
drop
over
chelsea
bridge
the
will
always
have
in
you
a
good
friend
to
look
after
her
when
she
comes
to
imagine
i
mean
to
thrust
myself
in
at
your
breakfast
table
to
give
you
advice
if
a
husband
and
wife
can
not
manage
their
own
affairs
satisfactorily
no
third
person
can
and
i
am
getting
to
be
an
elderly
man
who
likes
peace
and
comfort
and
his
own
wish
you
talk
such
nonsense
said
lavender
impetuously
know
you
are
bound
to
marry
and
the
woman
you
ask
to
marry
you
will
be
a
precious
fool
if
she
refuses
i
know
indeed
how
you
and
sheila
ever
escaped
here
lavender
said
his
companion
speaking
in
a
somewhat
more
earnest
fashion
you
marry
sheila
mackenzie
i
suppose
i
may
see
something
of
both
of
you
from
time
to
time
but
you
are
naturally
jealous
and
exacting
as
is
the
way
with
many
good
fellows
who
have
had
too
much
of
their
own
will
in
the
world
and
if
you
start
off
with
the
notion
now
that
sheila
and
i
might
ever
have
married
or
that
such
a
thing
was
ever
thought
of
by
either
of
us
the
certain
consequence
will
be
that
you
will
become
jealous
of
me
and
that
in
time
i
shall
have
to
stop
seeing
either
of
you
if
you
happen
to
be
living
in
if
ever
the
time
comes
said
lavender
lightly
i
prove
myself
such
a
fool
i
hope
i
shall
remember
that
a
millstone
can
be
bought
in
victoria
road
and
that
chelsea
bridge
is
right
going
to
for
sometime
after
ingram
was
permitted
to
rest
in
peace
and
it
was
not
until
they
had
reached
some
big
station
or
other
toward
morning
that
he
woke
lavender
had
never
closed
his
eyes
you
been
asleep
the
matter
now
seemed
to
have
acquired
a
trick
recently
of
looking
at
all
the
difficulties
of
your
position
at
once
why
you
take
them
singly
just
got
rid
of
opposition
that
might
have
contented
you
for
a
think
the
best
plan
will
be
to
say
nothing
of
this
to
my
aunt
at
present
i
think
we
ought
to
get
married
first
and
when
i
take
sheila
to
see
her
as
my
wife
what
can
she
say
then
what
is
sheila
likely
to
say
before
then
and
father
you
must
be
out
of
your
will
be
a
pretty
scene
then
when
i
tell
hurt
anybody
unless
when
they
end
in
brickbats
or
decanters
your
aunt
must
know
you
would
marry
some
but
you
know
whom
she
wished
me
to
nothing
every
old
lady
has
a
fancy
for
imagining
possible
marriages
but
your
aunt
is
a
reasonable
woman
and
could
not
possibly
object
to
your
marrying
a
girl
like
she
then
you
know
her
my
dear
what
are
the
arms
borne
by
your
family
dear
aunt
i
will
describe
them
to
you
as
becomes
a
dutiful
nephew
the
arms
are
quarterly
first
and
fourth
vert
a
herring
argent
second
and
third
azure
a
volant
or
the
crest
out
of
a
crown
vallery
argent
a
cask
of
whisky
gules
supporters
dexter
a
gillie
sinister
a
a
very
good

you
might
add
the

or
regum
to
think
that
your
aunt
would
forbid
you
wedding
a
daughter
should
wed
the
daughter
aunt
or
no
aunt
in
any
case
but
you
see
it
would
be
uncommonly
awkward
just
as
old
mackenzie
would
want
to
know
something
more
particular
about
my
circumstances
and
he
might
ask
for
references
to
the
old
lady
herself
just
as
if
i
were
a
tenant
about
to
take
a
have
given
him
enough
references
go
to
sleep
and
bother
but
now
ingram
found
himself
just
as
unable
as
his
companion
to
escape
into
unconsciousness
and
so
he
roused
himself
thoroughly
and
began
to
talk
about
lewis
and
borva
and
the
mackenzies
and
the
duties
and
responsibilities
lavender
would
undertake
in
marrying
sheila
he
said
expect
you
to
live
in
stornoway
at
least
half
the
year
and
it
will
be
very
hard
on
him
if
you
as
to
that
said
the
other
should
have
no
objection
but
you
see
if
i
am
to
get
married
i
really
think
i
ought
to
try
to
get
into
some
position
of
earning
my
own
living
or
helping
toward
it
you
know
i
begin
to
see
how
galling
this
sort
of
dependence
on
my
aunt
might
be
if
i
wished
to
act
for
myself
now
if
i
were
to
begin
to
do
anything
i
could
not
go
and
bury
myself
in
lewis
for
half
the
year
just
at
first
by
and
by
you
know
it
might
be
different
but
you
think
i
ought
to
begin
and
do
something
certainly
i
have
often
wished
you
had
been
born
a
carpenter
or
painter
or
are
not
born
carpenters
or
glaziers
but
sometimes
they
are
born
painters
i
think
i
have
been
born
nothing
but
i
am
willing
to
try
more
especially
as
i
think
sheila
would
like
know
she
will
write
and
tell
her
the
moment
i
get
to
would
fix
first
what
your
occupation
was
to
be
if
i
were
you
there
is
no
hurry
about
telling
sheila
although
she
will
be
very
glad
to
get
as
much
news
of
you
as
possible
and
i
hope
you
will
spare
no
time
or
trouble
in
pleasing
her
in
that
line
what
an
infamous
shame
it
was
of
you
to
go
and
gammon
old
mackenzie
into
the
belief
that
he
can
read
poetry
why
he
will
make
that
life
a
burden
to
her
i
heard
him
propose
to
read
to
her
as
soon
as
the
rain
set
gammon
him
said
lavender
with
a
laugh
man
thinks
he
can
read
poetry
better
than
every
other
man
even
as
every
man
fancies
that
no
one
gets
cigars
as
good
and
as
cheap
as
he
does
and
that
no
one
can
drive
a
horse
safely
but
himself
my
talking
about
his
reading
was
not
as
bad
as
persuading
him
that
he
can
play
whist
did
you
ever
know
a
man
who
did
not
believe
that
everybody
reading
of
poetry
was
affected
stilted
and
unbearable
i
know
mackenzie
must
have
been
reading
poetry
to
sheila
long
before
i
mentioned
it
to
that
suggestion
about
his
resonant
voice
and
the
crystal
palace
was
a
did
not
take
it
as
a
joke
and
neither
did
sheila
would
believe
that
her
father
could
command
the
channel
fleet
or
turn
out
the
present
ministry
or
build
a
bridge
to
america
if
only
anybody
hinted
it
to
her
touching
that
crystal
palace
did
you
observe
how
little
notion
of
size
she
could
have
got
from
pictures
when
she
asked
me
if
the
crystal
palace
was
much
bigger
than
the
at
lewis
castle
a
world
of
wonder
the
girl
is
coming
into
said
the
other
meditatively
it
will
be
all
lit
up
by
one
sun
if
only
you
take
care
of
her
and
justify
her
belief
in
have
not
much
doubt
said
lavender
with
a
certain
modest
confidence
in
his
manner
which
had
repeatedly
of
late
pleased
his
friend
even
sheila
herself
could
scarcely
have
found
london
more
strange
than
did
the
two
men
who
had
just
returned
from
a
sojourn
in
the
northern
hebrides
the
dingy
trees
in
euston
square
the
pale
sunlight
that
shone
down
on
the
gray
pavements
the
noise
of
the
omnibuses
and
carts
the
multitude
of
strangers
the
blue
and
smoke
that
hung
about
tottenham
court
road
all
were
as
strange
to
them
as
the
sensation
of
sitting
in
a
hansom
and
being
driven
along
by
an
unseen
driver
lavender
confessed
afterward
that
he
was
pervaded
by
an
odd
sort
of
desire
to
know
whether
there
was
anybody
in
london
at
all
like
sheila
now
and
again
a
girl
passed
along
the
pavement
what
was
it
that
made
the
difference
between
her
and
the
other
girl
whom
he
had
just
left
yet
he
wished
to
have
the
difference
as
decided
as
possible
when
some
bright
girl
passed
he
was
anxious
to
prove
to
himself
that
she
was
not
to
be
compared
with
sheila
where
in
all
london
could
you
find
eyes
that
told
so
much
he
forgot
to
place
the
specialty
of
eyes
in
the
fact
of
their
being
a
dark
under
black
eyelashes
what
he
did
remember
was
that
no
eyes
could
possibly
say
the
same
things
to
him
as
they
had
said
and
where
in
all
london
was
the
same
sweet
aspect
to
be
found
or
the
same
unconsciously
proud
and
gentle
demeanor
or
the
same
tender
friendliness
expressed
in
a
beautiful
face
he
would
not
say
anything
against
london
women
for
all
that
it
was
no
fault
of
theirs
that
they
could
not
be
daughters
with
the
courage
and
frankness
and
sweetness
of
the
sea
gone
into
their
blood
he
was
only
too
pleased
to
have
proved
to
himself
by
looking
at
some
pretty
that
not
in
london
was
there
any
one
to
compare
with
princess
sheila
for
many
a
day
thereafter
ingram
had
to
suffer
a
good
deal
of
this
sort
of
logic
and
bore
it
with
great
fortitude
indeed
nothing
pleased
him
more
than
to
observe
that
affection
so
far
from
waning
engrossed
more
and
more
of
his
thought
and
his
time
and
he
listened
with
unfailing
and
patience
to
the
perpetual
talk
of
his
friend
about
sheila
and
her
home
and
the
future
that
might
be
in
store
for
both
of
them
if
he
had
accepted
half
the
invitations
to
dinner
sent
down
to
him
at
the
board
of
trade
by
his
friend
he
would
scarcely
ever
have
been
out
of
club
many
a
long
evening
they
passed
in
this
way
either
in
rooms
in
king
street
or
in
lodgings
in
sloane
street
ingram
quite
consented
to
lie
in
a
chair
and
smoke
sometimes
putting
in
a
word
of
caution
to
bring
lavender
back
from
the
romantic
sheila
to
the
real
sheila
sometimes
smiling
at
some
wild
proposal
or
statement
on
the
part
of
his
friend
but
always
glad
to
see
that
the
pretty
idealisms
planted
during
their
stay
in
the
far
north
were
in
no
danger
of
dying
out
down
here
in
the
south
those
were
great
days
too
when
a
letter
arrived
from
sheila
nothing
had
been
said
about
their
corresponding
but
lavender
had
written
shortly
after
his
arrival
in
london
and
sheila
had
answered
for
her
father
and
herself
it
wanted
but
a
very
little
amount
of
ingenuity
to
continue
the
interchange
of
letters
thus
begun
and
when
the
envelope
arrived
high
holiday
was
immediately
proclaimed
by
the
recipient
of
it
he
did
not
show
ingram
these
letters
of
course
but
the
contents
of
them
were
soon
bit
by
bit
revealed
he
was
also
permitted
to
see
the
envelope
as
if
handwriting
had
some
magical
charm
about
it
sometimes
indeed
ingram
had
himself
a
letter
from
sheila
and
that
was
immediately
shown
to
lavender
was
he
pleased
to
find
that
these
communications
were
excessively
describing
how
the
fishing
was
going
on
what
was
doing
in
the
schools
and
how
john
the
piper
was
conducting
himself
with
talk
about
the
projected
telegraphic
cable
the
shooting
in
harris
the
health
of
bras
and
other
esoteric
matters
communications
with
the
king
of
borva
were
of
a
different
nature
wonderful
volumes
on
building
agriculture
and
what
not
tobacco
hailing
from
certain
royal
sources
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
pyramids
and
now
and
again
a
new
sort
of
rifle
or
some
fresh
invention
in
these
were
the
sort
of
things
that
found
their
way
to
lewis
and
then
in
reply
came
haunches
of
venison
and
kegs
of
rare
whisky
and
skins
of
wild
animals
which
all
very
admirable
in
their
way
were
a
trifle
cumbersome
in
a
couple
of
moderate
rooms
in
king
street
but
here
lavender
hit
upon
a
happy
device
he
had
long
ago
talked
to
his
aunt
about
the
mysterious
potentate
in
the
far
north
who
was
the
ruler
of
man
beast
and
fish
and
who
had
an
only
daughter
when
these
presents
arrived
mrs
lavender
was
informed
that
they
were
meant
for
her
and
was
given
to
understand
that
they
were
the
propitiatory
gifts
of
a
monarch
who
wished
to
seek
her
friendship
in
vain
did
ingram
warn
lavender
of
the
possible
danger
of
this
foolish
joke
the
young
man
laughed
and
would
come
down
to
sloane
street
with
another
story
of
his
success
as
an
envoy
of
the
distant
king
and
so
the
months
went
slowly
by
and
lavender
raved
about
sheila
and
dreamed
about
sheila
and
was
always
going
to
begin
some
splendid
achievement
for
sake
but
never
just
managed
to
begin
after
all
the
future
did
not
look
very
terrible
and
the
present
was
satisfactory
enough
mrs
lavender
had
no
objection
whatever
to
listening
to
his
praises
of
sheila
and
had
even
gone
the
length
of
approving
of
the
photograph
when
it
was
shown
her
but
at
the
end
of
six
months
lavender
suddenly
went
down
to
sloane
street
found
ingram
in
his
lodgings
and
said
i
start
for
lewis
more
fool
you
was
the
complacent
reply
bear
this
any
longer
i
must
go
and
see
have
to
bear
worse
if
you
go
you
know
what
getting
to
lewis
is
in
the
winter
be
killed
with
cold
before
you
see
the
can
stand
a
good
bit
of
cold
when
a
reason
for
it
said
the
young
man
i
have
written
to
sheila
to
say
i
should
start
that
case
i
had
better
make
use
of
you
i
suppose
you
mind
taking
up
to
sheila
a
sealskin
jacket
that
i
have
bought
for
her
you
have
bought
for
her
said
the
other
how
could
he
have
spared
fifteen
pounds
out
of
his
narrow
income
for
such
a
present
and
yet
he
laughed
at
the
idea
of
his
ever
having
been
in
love
with
sheila
lavender
took
the
sealskin
jacket
with
him
and
started
on
his
journey
to
the
north
it
was
certainly
all
that
ingram
had
prophesied
in
the
way
of
discomfort
hardship
and
delay
but
one
forenoon
lavender
coming
up
from
the
cabin
of
the
steamer
into
which
he
had
descended
to
escape
from
the
bitter
wind
and
the
sleet
saw
before
him
a
strange
thing
in
the
middle
of
the
black
sea
and
under
a
dark
gray
sky
lay
a
long
of
gleaming
snow
far
as
the
eye
could
see
the
successive
headlands
of
pale
white
jutted
out
into
the
dark
ocean
until
in
the
south
they
faded
into
a
gray
mist
and
became
invisible
and
when
they
got
into
stornoway
harbor
how
black
seemed
the
waters
of
the
little
bay
and
the
hulls
of
the
boats
and
the
windows
of
the
houses
against
the
blinding
white
of
the
encircling
hills
said
lavender
to
the
captain
will
be
a
cold
drive
across
to
loch
roag
i
shall
give
man
a
good
dram
before
we
but
it
was
not
notion
of
hospitality
to
send
duncan
to
meet
an
honored
guest
and
ere
the
vessel
was
fast
moored
lavender
had
caught
sight
of
the
pair
of
horses
and
the
brown
wagonette
and
mackenzie
stamping
up
and
down
in
the
trampled
snow
and
this
figure
close
down
to
the
edge
of
the
quay
surely
there
was
something
about
the
thick
gray
shawl
the
white
feather
the
set
of
the
head
that
he
knew
sheila
he
cried
jumping
ashore
before
the
gangway
was
shoved
across
made
you
come
to
stornoway
on
such
a
day
it
is
not
much
my
coming
to
stornoway
if
you
will
come
all
the
way
from
england
to
the
lewis
said
sheila
looking
up
with
her
bright
and
glad
eyes
for
six
months
he
had
been
trying
to
recall
the
tones
of
her
voice
in
looking
at
her
picture
and
had
failed
now
he
fancied
that
she
spoke
more
sweetly
and
musically
than
ever
ay
said
mackenzie
when
he
had
shaken
hands
with
the
young
man
wass
a
piece
of
foolishness
her
coming
over
to
meet
you
in
styornoway
but
the
girl
will
be
neither
to
hold
nor
to
bind
when
she
teks
a
foolishness
into
her
this
the
character
i
hear
of
you
sheila
he
said
and
mackenzie
laughed
at
his
embarrassment
and
said
she
was
a
good
lass
for
all
that
and
bundled
both
the
young
folks
into
the
inn
where
luncheon
had
been
provided
with
a
blazing
fire
in
the
room
and
a
kettle
of
hot
water
steaming
beside
it
when
they
got
to
borva
lavender
began
to
see
that
mackenzie
had
laid
the
most
subtle
plans
for
reconciling
him
to
the
hard
weather
of
these
northern
winters
and
the
young
man
nothing
loth
fell
into
his
ways
and
was
astonished
at
the
amusement
and
interest
that
could
be
got
out
of
a
residence
in
this
bleak
island
at
such
a
season
mackenzie
discarded
at
once
the
feeble
protection
against
cold
and
wet
which
his
guest
had
brought
with
him
he
gave
him
a
pair
of
his
own
knickerbockers
and
enormous
boots
he
made
him
wear
a
frieze
coat
borrowed
from
duncan
he
insisted
on
his
turning
down
the
flap
of
a
sealskin
cap
and
tying
the
ends
under
his
chin
and
thus
equipped
they
started
on
many
a
rare
expedition
around
the
coast
but
on
their
first
going
out
mackenzie
looking
at
him
said
with
some
chagrin
they
wear
gloves
when
they
go
shooting
in
your
country
said
lavender
are
only
a
pair
of
old
dogskins
i
use
chiefly
to
keep
my
hands
clean
you
see
i
have
cut
out
the
trigger
finger
and
they
keep
your
hands
from
being
numbed
you
know
with
the
cold
or
the
will
be
not
much
need
of
that
after
a
little
while
said
mackenzie
and
indeed
after
half
an
tramping
over
snow
and
climbing
over
rocks
lavender
was
well
inclined
to
please
the
old
man
by
tossing
the
gloves
into
the
sea
for
his
hands
were
burning
with
heat
then
the
pleasant
evenings
after
all
the
fatigues
of
the
day
were
over
clothes
changed
dinner
despatched
and
sheila
at
the
open
piano
in
that
warm
little
with
its
strange
shells
and
fishes
and
birds
love
in
thine
eyes
for
ever
plays
he
in
thy
snowy
bosom
strays
they
sang
just
as
in
the
times
of
summer
and
now
old
mackenzie
had
got
on
a
bit
further
in
his
musical
studies
and
could
hum
with
the
best
of
them
he
makes
thy
rosy
lips
his
care
and
walks
the
mazes
of
thy
hair
there
was
no
winter
at
all
in
the
snug
little
room
with
its
crimson
fire
and
closed
shutters
and
songs
of
happier
times
the
rosy
morn
had
nothing
inappropriate
in
it
and
if
they
particularly
studied
the
words
of
wert
thou
in
the
cauld
blast
it
was
only
that
sheila
might
teach
her
companion
the
scotch
pronunciation
as
far
as
she
knew
it
and
once
half
in
joke
lavender
said
he
could
believe
it
was
summer
again
if
sheila
had
only
on
her
silk
dress
with
the
red
ribbon
around
her
neck
and
sure
enough
after
dinner
she
came
down
in
that
dress
and
lavender
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
in
gratitude
just
at
that
moment
too
mackenzie
began
to
swear
at
duncan
for
not
having
brought
him
his
pipe
and
not
only
went
out
of
the
room
for
it
but
was
a
full
half
hour
in
finding
it
when
he
came
in
again
he
was
singing
carelessly
love
in
thine
eyes
for
ever
plays
just
as
if
he
had
got
his
pipe
around
the
corner
for
it
had
been
all
explained
by
this
time
you
know
and
sheila
had
in
a
couple
of
trembling
words
pledged
away
her
life
and
her
father
had
given
his
consent
more
than
that
he
would
have
done
for
the
girl
if
need
were
and
when
he
saw
the
perfect
happiness
shining
in
her
eyes
when
he
saw
that
through
some
vague
feelings
of
compunction
or
gratitude
or
even
exuberant
joy
she
was
more
than
usually
affectionate
toward
himself
he
grew
reconciled
to
the
ways
of
providence
and
was
ready
to
believe
that
ingram
had
done
them
all
a
good
turn
in
bringing
his
friend
from
the
south
with
him
if
there
was
any
haunting
fear
at
all
it
was
about
the
possibility
of
husband
refusing
to
live
in
stornoway
even
for
half
the
year
or
a
portion
of
the
year
but
did
not
the
young
man
express
himself
as
delighted
beyond
measure
with
lewis
and
the
lewis
people
and
the
sports
and
scenery
and
climate
of
the
island
if
mackenzie
could
have
bought
fine
weather
at
twenty
pounds
a
day
lavender
would
have
gone
back
to
london
with
the
conviction
that
there
was
only
one
thing
better
than
lewis
in
and
that
was
lewis
in
time
of
snow
and
frost
the
blow
fell
one
evening
a
distinct
thaw
set
in
during
the
night
the
wind
went
around
to
southwest
and
in
the
morning
lo
the
very
desolation
of
desolation
suainabhal
mealasabhal
cracabhal
were
all
hidden
away
behind
dreary
folds
of
mist
a
slow
and
steady
rain
poured
down
from
the
lowering
skies
on
the
wet
rocks
the
marshy
pasture
land
and
the
leafless
bushes
the
atlantic
lay
dark
under
a
gray
fog
and
you
could
scarcely
see
across
the
loch
in
front
of
the
house
sometimes
the
wind
freshened
a
bit
and
howled
about
the
house
or
dashed
showers
against
the
streaming
panes
but
ordinarily
there
was
no
sound
but
the
ceaseless
hissing
of
the
rain
on
the
wet
gravel
at
the
door
and
the
rush
of
the
waves
along
the
black
rocks
all
signs
of
life
seemed
to
have
fled
from
the
earth
and
the
sky
bird
and
beast
had
alike
taken
shelter
and
not
even
a
gull
or
a
crossed
the
melancholy
lines
of
moorland
which
were
half
obscured
by
the
mist
of
the
rain
it
be
fine
weather
always
said
lavender
cheerfully
when
mackenzie
was
affecting
to
be
greatly
surprised
to
find
such
a
thing
as
rain
in
the
island
of
lewis
that
iss
quite
true
said
the
old
man
wass
ferry
good
weather
we
were
having
since
you
hef
come
here
and
what
iss
a
little
rain
oh
nothing
at
all
you
will
see
it
will
go
away
whenever
the
wind
goes
with
that
mackenzie
would
again
go
out
to
the
front
of
the
house
take
a
turn
up
and
down
the
wet
gravel
and
pretend
to
be
scanning
the
horizon
for
signs
of
a
change
sheila
a
good
deal
more
honest
went
about
her
household
duties
saying
merely
to
lavender
am
very
sorry
the
weather
has
broken
but
it
may
clear
before
you
go
away
from
i
go
do
you
expect
it
to
rain
for
a
week
it
will
not
but
it
is
looking
very
bad
said
sheila
i
care
said
the
young
man
it
should
rain
the
skies
down
if
only
you
would
keep
in
doors
sheila
but
you
do
go
out
in
such
a
reckless
fashion
you
seem
to
reflect
that
it
is
do
not
get
wet
she
said
when
you
came
up
from
the
shore
half
an
hour
ago
your
hair
was
as
wet
as
possible
and
your
face
all
red
and
gleaming
with
the
i
am
none
the
worse
and
i
am
not
wet
now
it
is
impossible
that
you
will
always
keep
in
a
room
if
you
have
things
to
do
and
a
little
rain
does
not
hurt
any
occurs
to
me
sheila
he
observed
slowly
you
are
an
exceedingly
obstinate
and
young
person
and
that
no
one
has
ever
exercised
any
proper
control
over
she
looked
up
for
a
moment
with
a
sudden
glance
of
surprise
and
pain
but
she
saw
in
his
eyes
that
he
meant
nothing
and
she
went
forward
to
him
putting
her
hand
in
his
hand
and
saying
with
a
smile
am
very
willing
to
be
you
really
hear
my
commands
you
shall
go
out
in
time
of
rain
without
putting
something
over
your
head
or
taking
an
umbrella
you
shall
go
out
in
the
without
taking
some
one
with
you
besides
mairi
you
shall
never
if
you
are
away
from
home
go
within
fifty
yards
of
the
sea
so
long
as
there
is
snow
on
the
that
is
so
very
many
things
already
is
it
not
enough
said
sheila
will
faithfully
remember
and
observe
these
rules
you
are
a
more
obedient
girl
then
i
imagined
or
expected
and
you
may
now
if
you
are
good
have
the
satisfaction
of
offering
me
a
glass
of
sherry
and
a
biscuit
for
rain
or
no
rain
lewis
is
a
dreadful
place
for
making
people
mackenzie
need
not
have
been
afraid
strange
as
it
may
appear
lavender
was
well
content
with
the
wet
weather
no
depression
or
impatience
or
remonstrance
was
visible
on
his
face
when
he
went
to
the
blurred
windows
day
after
day
to
see
only
the
same
desolate
picture
the
dark
sea
the
wet
rocks
the
gray
mists
over
the
moorland
and
the
shining
of
the
red
gravel
before
the
house
he
would
stand
with
his
hands
in
his
pocket
and
whistle
in
thine
eyes
forever
plays
just
as
if
he
were
looking
out
on
a
cheerful
summer
sunrise
when
he
and
sheila
went
to
the
door
and
were
received
by
a
cold
blast
of
wet
wind
and
a
driving
shower
of
rain
he
would
slam
the
door
to
again
with
a
laugh
and
pull
the
girl
back
into
the
house
sometimes
she
would
not
be
controlled
and
then
he
would
accompany
her
about
the
garden
as
she
attended
to
her
duties
or
would
go
down
to
the
shore
with
her
to
give
bras
a
run
from
these
excursions
he
returned
in
the
best
of
spirits
with
a
fine
color
in
his
face
until
having
got
accustomed
to
heavy
boots
impervious
frieze
and
the
discomfort
of
wet
hands
he
grew
to
be
about
as
indifferent
to
the
rain
as
sheila
herself
and
went
fishing
or
shooting
or
boating
with
much
content
whether
it
was
wet
or
dry
has
been
the
happiest
month
of
my
life
i
know
that
he
said
to
mackenzie
as
they
stood
together
on
the
quay
at
stornoway
i
hope
you
will
hef
many
like
it
in
the
lewis
said
the
old
man
cheerfully
think
i
should
soon
learn
to
become
a
highlander
up
here
said
lavender
sheila
would
only
teach
me
the
gaelic
cried
mackenzie
impatiently
gaelic
it
is
none
of
the
gentlemen
who
will
come
here
in
the
autumn
will
want
the
gaelic
and
what
for
would
you
want
the
gaelic
ay
if
you
was
staying
here
all
the
year
round
sheila
will
teach
me
all
the
same
you
sheila
he
said
turning
to
his
companion
who
was
gazing
somewhat
blankly
at
the
rough
steamer
and
at
the
rough
gray
sea
beyond
the
harbor
said
the
girl
she
seemed
in
no
mood
for
joking
lavender
returned
to
town
more
in
love
than
ever
and
soon
the
news
of
his
engagement
was
spread
abroad
he
nothing
loath
most
of
his
laughed
and
prophesied
it
would
come
to
nothing
how
could
a
man
in
position
marry
anybody
but
an
heiress
he
could
not
afford
to
go
and
marry
a
daughter
others
came
to
the
conclusion
that
artists
and
writers
and
all
that
sort
of
people
were
incomprehensible
and
said
beggar
when
they
thought
of
the
fashion
in
which
lavender
had
ruined
his
chances
in
life
his
lady
friends
however
were
much
more
sympathetic
there
was
a
dash
of
romance
in
the
story
and
would
not
the
highland
girl
be
a
curiosity
a
little
while
after
she
came
to
town
was
she
like
any
of
the
pictures
mr
lavender
had
hanging
up
in
his
rooms
had
he
not
even
a
sketch
of
her
an
artist
and
yet
not
have
a
portrait
of
the
girl
he
had
chosen
to
marry
lavender
had
no
portrait
of
sheila
to
show
some
little
photographs
he
had
he
kept
for
his
own
while
in
vain
had
he
tried
to
get
some
sketch
or
picture
that
would
convey
to
the
world
of
his
friends
and
acquaintances
some
notion
of
his
future
bride
they
were
left
to
draw
on
their
imagination
for
some
presentment
of
the
coming
princess
he
told
mrs
lavender
of
course
she
said
little
but
sent
for
edward
ingram
him
she
questioned
in
a
cautious
close
and
yet
apparently
indifferent
way
and
then
merely
said
that
frank
was
very
impetuous
that
it
was
a
pity
he
had
resolved
on
marrying
out
of
his
own
sphere
of
life
but
that
she
hoped
the
young
lady
from
the
highlands
would
prove
a
good
wife
to
him
hope
he
will
prove
a
good
husband
to
her
said
ingram
with
unusual
sharpness
is
very
that
was
all
mrs
lavender
would
say
by
and
by
as
the
spring
grew
on
and
the
time
of
the
marriage
was
coming
nearer
the
important
business
of
taking
and
furnishing
a
house
for
reception
occupied
the
attention
of
the
young
man
from
morning
till
night
he
had
been
somewhat
disappointed
at
the
cold
fashion
in
which
his
aunt
looked
upon
his
choice
admitting
everything
he
had
to
say
in
praise
of
sheila
but
never
expressing
any
approval
of
his
conduct
or
hope
about
the
future
but
now
she
showed
herself
most
amiably
and
generously
disposed
she
supplied
the
young
man
with
abundant
funds
wherewith
to
furnish
the
house
according
to
his
own
fancy
it
was
a
small
place
fronting
a
somewhat
commonplace
square
in
notting
hill
but
it
was
to
be
a
miracle
of
artistic
adornment
inside
he
tortured
himself
for
days
over
rival
shades
and
hues
he
drew
designs
for
the
chairs
he
himself
painted
a
good
deal
of
paneling
and
in
short
gave
up
his
whole
time
to
making
future
home
beautiful
his
aunt
regarded
these
preparations
with
little
interest
but
she
certainly
gave
her
nephew
ample
means
to
indulge
the
eccentricities
of
his
fancy
she
a
dear
old
lady
said
lavender
one
night
to
ingram
here
a
check
received
this
morning
for
two
hundred
pounds
for
plate
and
ingram
looked
at
the
bit
of
pale
green
paper
wish
you
had
earned
the
money
yourself
or
done
without
the
plate
until
you
could
buy
it
with
your
own
confound
it
ingram
you
carry
your
puritanical
theories
too
far
doubtless
i
shall
earn
my
own
living
by
and
by
give
me
is
now
nearly
a
year
since
you
thought
of
marrying
sheila
mackenzie
and
you
have
not
done
a
stroke
of
work
beg
your
pardon
i
have
worked
a
good
deal
of
late
as
you
will
see
when
you
come
up
to
my
you
sold
a
single
picture
since
last
summer
can
not
make
people
buy
my
pictures
if
they
choose
to
do
you
made
any
effort
to
get
them
sold
or
to
come
to
any
arrangement
with
any
of
the
dealers
have
been
too
busy
of
late
looking
after
this
house
you
know
said
lavender
with
an
air
of
apology
were
not
too
busy
to
paint
a
fan
for
lorraine
that
people
say
must
have
occupied
you
for
lavender
laughed
you
know
ingram
i
think
you
are
jealous
of
lorraine
on
account
of
sheila
come
you
shall
go
and
see
thank
you
afraid
of
your
puritan
principles
giving
way
am
afraid
that
you
are
a
very
foolish
boy
said
the
other
with
a
shrug
of
resignation
i
hope
to
see
you
mend
when
you
then
you
see
a
difference
said
lavender
seriously
and
so
the
dispute
ended
it
had
been
arranged
that
ingram
should
go
up
to
lewis
to
the
marriage
and
after
the
ceremony
in
stornoway
return
to
borva
with
mackenzie
to
remain
with
him
a
few
days
but
at
the
last
moment
ingram
was
summoned
down
to
devonshire
on
account
of
the
serious
illness
of
some
near
relative
and
accordingly
frank
lavender
started
by
himself
to
bring
back
with
him
his
highland
bride
his
stay
in
borva
was
short
enough
on
this
occasion
at
the
end
of
it
there
came
a
certain
wet
and
boisterous
day
the
occurrences
in
which
he
afterwards
remembered
as
if
they
had
taken
place
in
a
dream
there
were
many
faces
about
a
confusion
of
tongues
a
good
deal
of
a
skirl
of
pipes
and
a
hurry
through
the
rain
but
all
these
things
gave
place
to
the
occasional
glance
he
got
from
a
pair
of
timid
and
trusting
and
beautiful
eyes
yet
sheila
was
not
sheila
in
that
dress
of
white
with
her
face
a
trifle
pale
she
was
more
his
own
sheila
when
she
had
donned
her
rough
garments
of
blue
and
when
she
stood
on
the
wet
deck
of
the
vessel
with
a
great
gray
shawl
around
her
talking
to
her
father
with
a
brave
effort
at
cheerfulness
although
her
lip
would
occasionally
quiver
as
one
or
other
of
her
friends
from
borva
many
of
them
barefooted
children
came
up
to
bid
her
her
father
talked
rapidly
with
a
grand
affectation
of
indifference
he
swore
at
the
weather
he
bade
her
see
that
bras
was
properly
fed
and
if
the
sea
broke
over
his
box
in
the
night
he
was
to
be
rubbed
dry
and
let
out
in
the
morning
for
a
run
up
and
down
the
deck
she
was
not
to
forget
the
parcel
directed
to
an
innkeeper
at
oban
they
would
find
oban
a
very
nice
place
at
which
to
break
the
journey
to
london
but
as
for
greenock
mackenzie
could
find
no
words
with
which
to
describe
greenock
and
then
in
the
midst
of
all
this
sheila
suddenly
said
when
does
the
steamer
leave
a
few
minutes
they
have
got
nearly
all
the
cargo
on
you
do
me
a
great
favor
papa
but
what
is
it
sheila
want
you
not
to
stay
here
till
the
boat
sails
and
then
you
will
have
all
the
people
on
the
quay
vexing
you
when
you
are
going
away
i
want
you
to
bid
to
us
now
and
drive
away
around
to
the
point
and
we
shall
see
you
the
last
of
all
when
the
steamer
has
got
out
of
the
well
sheila
i
will
do
that
he
said
knowing
well
why
the
girl
wished
it
so
father
and
daughter
bade
to
each
other
and
mackenzie
went
on
shore
with
his
face
down
and
said
not
a
word
to
any
of
his
friends
on
the
quay
but
got
into
the
wagonette
and
lashing
his
horses
drove
rapidly
away
as
he
had
shaken
hands
with
lavender
lavender
had
said
to
him
we
shall
soon
be
back
in
borva
again
to
see
you
and
the
old
man
had
merely
tightened
the
grip
of
his
hand
as
he
left
the
roar
of
the
ceased
the
throb
of
the
engines
struck
the
water
and
the
great
steamer
steamed
away
from
the
quay
and
out
of
the
plain
of
the
harbor
into
a
wide
world
of
gray
waves
and
wind
and
rain
there
stood
mackenzie
as
they
passed
the
dark
figure
clearly
seen
against
the
pallid
colors
of
the
dismal
day
and
sheila
waved
a
handkerchief
to
him
until
stornoway
and
its
lighthouse
and
all
the
promontories
and
bays
of
the
great
island
had
faded
into
the
white
mists
that
lay
along
the
horizon
and
then
her
arm
fell
to
her
side
and
for
a
moment
she
stood
bewildered
with
a
strange
look
in
her
eyes
of
grief
and
almost
of
despair
my
darling
you
must
go
below
now
said
her
companion
are
almost
dead
with
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
as
though
she
had
scarcely
heard
what
he
said
but
his
eyes
were
full
of
pity
for
her
he
drew
her
closer
to
him
and
put
his
arms
around
her
and
then
she
hid
her
head
in
his
bosom
and
sobbed
there
like
a
child
part
chapter
to
london
he
was
about
to
add
but
suddenly
stopped
the
girl
who
had
hastily
come
forward
to
meet
him
with
a
glad
look
in
her
eyes
and
with
both
hands
doubtless
perceived
the
brief
embarrassment
of
the
moment
and
was
perhaps
a
little
amused
by
it
but
she
took
no
notice
of
it
she
merely
advanced
to
him
and
caught
both
his
hands
and
said
are
you
very
well
it
was
the
old
and
familiar
salutation
uttered
in
the
same
odd
gentle
insinuating
fashion
and
in
the
same
low
and
sweet
voice
stay
in
oban
and
the
few
days
she
had
already
spent
in
london
had
not
taught
her
the
difference
between
and
is
so
strange
to
hear
you
speak
in
london
lavender
he
said
with
rather
a
wry
face
as
he
pronounced
her
full
and
proper
title
and
now
it
was
turn
to
look
a
bit
embarrassed
and
color
and
appear
uncertain
whether
to
be
vexed
or
pleased
when
her
husband
himself
broke
in
in
his
usual
impetuous
fashion
say
ingram
be
a
fool
of
course
you
must
call
her
sheila
unless
when
there
are
people
here
and
then
you
must
please
yourself
why
the
poor
girl
has
enough
of
strange
things
and
names
about
her
already
i
know
how
she
keeps
her
head
it
would
bewilder
me
i
know
but
i
can
see
that
after
she
has
stood
at
the
window
for
a
time
and
begun
to
get
dazed
by
all
the
wonderful
sights
and
sounds
outside
she
suddenly
withdraws
and
fixes
all
her
attention
on
some
little
domestic
duty
just
as
if
she
were
hanging
on
to
the
practical
things
of
life
to
assure
herself
it
all
a
dream
that
so
sheila
he
said
putting
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
ought
not
to
watch
me
like
that
she
said
with
a
smile
it
is
the
noise
that
is
most
bewildering
there
are
many
places
i
will
know
already
when
i
see
them
many
places
and
things
i
have
known
in
pictures
but
now
the
size
of
them
and
the
noise
of
carriages
and
the
people
always
passing
always
different
always
strangers
so
that
you
never
see
the
same
people
any
more
but
i
am
getting
very
much
accustomed
to
are
trying
very
hard
to
get
accustomed
to
it
any
way
my
good
girl
said
her
husband
need
not
be
in
a
hurry
you
may
begin
to
regret
some
day
that
you
have
not
a
little
of
that
feeling
of
wonder
left
said
ingram
you
have
not
told
me
anything
of
what
you
think
about
london
and
of
how
you
like
it
and
how
you
like
your
house
and
what
you
have
done
with
bras
and
a
thousand
other
well
tell
you
all
that
directly
when
i
have
got
for
you
some
wine
and
some
you
can
ring
for
them
said
her
husband
but
she
had
by
that
time
departed
on
her
mission
presently
she
returned
and
waited
upon
ingram
just
as
if
she
had
been
in
her
house
in
borva
with
the
gentlemen
in
a
hurry
to
go
out
to
the
fishing
and
herself
the
only
one
who
could
serve
them
she
put
a
small
table
close
by
the
french
window
she
drew
back
the
curtains
as
far
as
they
would
go
to
show
the
sunshine
of
a
bright
forenoon
in
may
lighting
up
the
trees
in
the
square
and
gleaming
on
the
pale
and
tall
fronts
of
the
houses
beyond
and
she
wheeled
in
three
low
so
as
to
front
this
comparatively
cheerful
prospect
somehow
or
other
it
seemed
quite
natural
that
sheila
should
wheel
in
those
chairs
it
was
certainly
no
disrespect
on
the
part
of
either
her
husband
or
her
visitor
which
caused
both
of
them
to
sit
still
and
give
her
her
own
way
about
such
things
indeed
lavender
had
not
as
yet
ever
attempted
to
impress
upon
sheila
the
necessity
of
cultivating
the
art
of
helplessness
that
with
other
social
graces
would
perhaps
come
in
good
time
she
would
soon
acquire
the
habits
and
ways
of
her
friends
and
acquaintances
without
his
trying
to
force
upon
her
a
series
of
affectations
which
would
only
embarrass
her
and
cloud
the
perfect
frankness
and
spontaneity
of
her
nature
of
one
thing
he
was
quite
assured
that
whatever
mistakes
sheila
might
make
in
society
they
would
never
render
her
ridiculous
strangers
might
not
know
the
absolute
sincerity
of
every
word
and
act
which
gave
her
a
courage
that
had
no
fear
of
criticism
but
they
could
at
least
see
the
simple
grace
and
dignity
of
the
girl
and
that
natural
ease
of
manner
which
is
beyond
the
reach
of
cultivation
being
mainly
the
result
of
a
thorough
consciousness
of
honesty
to
burden
her
with
rules
and
regulations
of
conduct
would
be
to
produce
the
very
catastrophes
he
wished
to
avoid
where
no
attempt
is
made
failure
is
impossible
and
he
was
meanwhile
well
content
that
sheila
should
simply
appear
as
sheila
even
although
she
might
draw
in
a
chair
for
a
guest
or
so
far
forget
her
dignity
as
to
pour
out
some
wine
for
her
husband
all
sheila
said
lavender
i
better
begin
and
tell
ingram
about
your
surprise
and
delight
when
you
came
near
oban
and
saw
the
tall
hotels
and
the
trees
it
was
the
trees
i
think
that
struck
you
most
because
you
know
those
in
lewis
well
to
tell
the
truth
the
fact
is
the
trees
of
lewis
as
i
was
saying
the
trees
of
lewis
are
not
just
they
can
not
be
said
to
be
bad
boy
to
say
anything
against
the
lewis
exclaimed
sheila
and
ingram
held
that
she
was
right
and
that
there
were
certain
sorts
of
ingratitude
more
disgraceful
than
others
and
that
this
was
just
about
the
worst
i
have
brought
all
the
good
away
from
lewis
said
lavender
with
a
careless
impertinence
said
sheila
proudly
have
not
brought
away
my
papa
and
there
is
not
any
one
in
this
country
i
have
seen
as
good
as
he
dear
your
experience
of
the
thirty
millions
of
folks
in
these
islands
is
quite
convincing
i
was
wholly
in
the
wrong
and
if
you
forgive
me
we
shall
celebrate
our
reconciliation
in
a
cigarette
that
is
to
say
ingram
and
i
will
perform
the
rites
and
you
can
look
so
sheila
went
away
to
get
the
cigarettes
also
say
you
smoke
in
your
lavender
said
ingram
mindful
of
the
fastidious
ways
of
his
friend
even
when
he
had
rooms
in
king
street
i
though
i
smoke
everywhere
all
over
the
place
you
see
we
have
no
visitors
yet
no
one
is
supposed
to
know
we
have
come
south
sheila
must
get
all
sorts
of
things
before
she
can
be
introduced
to
my
friends
and
my
friends
and
the
house
must
be
put
to
rights
too
you
have
her
go
to
see
my
aunt
in
that
costume
she
used
to
rush
about
in
up
in
lewis
is
precisely
what
i
would
have
said
ingram
can
not
look
more
handsome
in
any
other
my
aunt
would
fancy
i
had
married
a
savage
i
believe
she
fears
something
of
the
sort
you
told
even
her
that
you
are
in
london
lavender
that
is
a
precious
silly
performance
suppose
she
hears
of
your
being
in
town
what
will
you
say
to
her
should
tell
her
i
wanted
a
few
days
to
get
my
wife
properly
dressed
before
taking
her
ingram
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
are
right
perhaps
indeed
it
would
be
better
if
you
waited
six
months
before
you
introduced
sheila
to
your
friends
at
present
you
seem
to
be
keeping
the
turned
down
until
everything
is
ready
for
the
first
scene
and
then
sheila
is
to
burst
upon
society
in
a
blaze
of
light
and
color
well
that
is
harmless
enough
but
look
here
you
know
much
about
her
yet
you
will
be
mainly
anxious
to
hear
what
the
audience
as
it
were
say
of
her
and
there
is
just
a
chance
of
your
adopting
their
impressions
and
opinions
of
sheila
seeing
that
you
have
no
very
fixed
ones
of
your
own
now
what
your
social
circle
may
think
about
her
is
a
difficult
thing
to
decide
and
i
confess
i
would
rather
have
seen
you
remain
six
months
in
lewis
before
bringing
her
up
ingram
was
at
least
a
candid
friend
it
was
not
the
first
nor
the
hundredth
time
that
frank
lavender
had
to
endure
small
lectures
uttered
in
a
slow
deliberate
voice
and
yet
with
an
indifference
of
manner
which
showed
that
ingram
cared
very
little
how
sharply
his
words
struck
home
he
rarely
even
apologized
for
his
bluntness
these
were
his
opinions
lavender
could
take
them
or
leave
them
as
he
liked
and
the
younger
man
after
finding
his
face
flush
a
bit
on
being
accused
of
wishing
to
make
a
dramatic
impression
with
entrance
into
london
society
laughed
in
an
embarrassed
way
and
said
is
impossible
to
be
angry
with
you
ingram
and
yet
you
do
talk
so
absurdly
i
wonder
who
is
likely
to
know
more
about
the
character
of
a
girl
than
her
own
husband
may
in
time
you
now
said
ingram
carefully
balancing
a
biscuit
on
the
point
of
his
finger
fact
is
said
lavender
with
impatience
are
the
most
romantic
card
i
know
and
there
is
no
pleasing
you
you
have
all
sorts
of
exalted
notions
about
things
about
sentiments
and
duties
and
so
forth
well
all
that
is
true
enough
and
would
be
right
enough
if
the
world
were
filled
with
men
and
women
like
yourself
but
then
it
you
see
and
one
has
to
give
in
to
conventionalities
of
dress
and
living
and
ceremonies
if
one
wants
to
retain
friends
now
i
like
to
see
you
going
about
with
that
it
suits
your
brown
complexion
and
beard
and
that
stick
that
would
do
for
herding
sheep
and
the
costume
looks
well
and
is
and
excellent
when
off
for
a
walk
over
the
surrey
downs
or
lying
on
the
about
henley
or
cookham
but
it
you
know
the
sort
of
costume
for
a
stroll
in
the
god
withdraws
from
me
my
small
share
of
common
sense
said
ingram
slowly
far
that
i
shall
begin
to
think
of
having
my
clothes
made
for
the
purpose
of
walking
in
hyde
park
well
you
see
said
lavender
one
must
meet
friends
especially
when
one
is
married
and
when
you
know
that
at
a
certain
hour
in
the
forenoon
they
are
all
to
be
found
in
a
particular
place
and
that
a
very
pleasant
place
and
that
you
will
do
yourself
good
by
having
a
walk
in
the
fresh
air
and
so
forth
i
really
see
anything
very
immoral
in
going
down
for
an
hour
or
so
to
the
you
think
the
pleasure
of
seeing
friends
might
be
postponed
till
one
had
done
some
sort
of
good
work
now
cried
lavender
is
another
of
your
delusions
you
are
always
against
superstitions
and
yet
you
make
work
a
fetish
you
do
with
work
just
as
women
do
with
duty
they
carry
about
with
them
a
convenient
little
god
and
they
are
always
worshiping
it
with
small
sacrifices
and
complimenting
themselves
on
a
series
of
little
martyrdoms
that
are
of
no
good
to
anybody
of
course
duty
be
duty
if
it
disagreeable
and
when
they
go
nursing
the
sick
and
they
could
get
it
better
done
for
fifteen
shillings
a
week
by
somebody
else
they
mind
coming
back
to
their
families
with
the
seeds
of
typhus
about
their
gowns
and
when
they
crush
the
affections
in
order
to
worship
at
the
shrine
of
duty
they
consider
that
they
may
be
making
martyrs
of
other
folks
who
want
martyrdom
and
get
no
sort
of
pleasure
out
of
it
now
what
in
all
the
world
is
the
good
of
work
as
work
i
believe
that
work
is
an
unmistakable
evil
but
when
it
is
a
necessity
i
suppose
you
get
some
sort
of
selfish
satisfaction
in
overcoming
it
and
doubtless
if
there
was
any
immediate
necessity
in
my
case
i
deny
the
necessity
may
arise
and
that
i
should
like
nothing
better
than
to
work
for
sake
you
are
coming
to
the
point
said
ingram
who
had
been
listening
with
his
usual
patience
to
his
somewhat
chaotic
speculations
you
may
have
to
work
for
your
sake
and
your
own
and
i
confess
i
am
surprised
to
see
you
so
content
with
your
present
circumstances
if
your
property
legally
reverted
to
you
if
you
had
any
sort
of
family
claim
on
it
that
would
make
some
little
difference
but
you
know
that
any
sudden
quarrel
between
you
might
leave
you
penniless
which
case
i
should
begin
to
work
and
i
should
come
to
you
for
my
first
you
have
it
i
would
leave
you
to
go
and
fight
the
world
for
yourself
without
which
a
man
knows
nothing
of
himself
or
of
his
relations
with
those
around
dear
here
are
the
cigarettes
said
sheila
at
this
point
and
as
she
came
and
sat
down
the
discussion
ceased
for
sheila
began
to
tell
her
friend
of
all
the
strange
adventures
that
had
befallen
her
since
she
left
the
far
island
of
lewis
how
she
had
seen
with
fear
the
great
mountains
of
skye
lit
up
by
the
wild
glare
of
a
stormy
sunrise
how
she
had
seen
with
astonishment
the
great
fir
woods
of
armadale
and
how
green
and
beautiful
were
the
shores
of
the
sound
of
mull
and
then
oban
with
its
shining
houses
its
blue
bay
and
its
magnificent
trees
all
lit
up
by
a
fair
and
still
sunshine
she
had
not
imagined
there
was
anywhere
in
the
world
so
beautiful
a
place
and
could
scarcely
believe
that
london
itself
was
more
rich
and
noble
and
impressive
for
there
were
beautiful
ladies
walking
along
the
broad
pavements
and
there
were
shops
with
large
windows
that
seemed
to
contain
everything
that
the
mind
could
desire
and
there
was
a
whole
fleet
of
yachts
in
the
bay
but
it
was
the
trees
above
all
that
captivated
her
and
she
asked
if
they
were
lords
who
owned
those
beautiful
houses
built
up
on
the
hill
and
half
smothered
among
lilacs
and
ash
trees
and
rowan
trees
and
ivy
darling
lavender
had
said
to
her
your
papa
were
to
come
and
live
here
he
could
buy
half
a
dozen
of
those
cottages
gardens
and
all
they
are
mostly
the
property
of
shopkeepers
if
this
little
place
takes
your
fancy
what
will
you
say
when
you
go
south
when
you
see
wimbledon
and
richmond
and
kew
with
their
grand
old
commons
and
trees
why
you
could
hide
oban
in
a
corner
of
richmond
park
my
papa
has
seen
all
those
places
you
think
it
strange
he
should
have
seen
them
all
and
known
he
could
live
in
any
one
of
them
and
then
gone
away
back
to
borva
what
would
the
poor
people
have
done
if
he
had
never
gone
back
some
one
else
would
have
taken
his
then
if
he
were
living
here
or
in
london
he
might
have
got
tired
and
he
might
have
wished
to
go
back
to
the
lewis
and
see
all
the
people
he
knew
and
then
he
would
come
among
them
like
a
stranger
and
have
no
house
to
go
then
lavender
said
quite
gently
you
think
sheila
you
will
ever
tire
of
living
in
the
south
the
girl
looked
up
quickly
and
said
with
a
sort
of
surprised
questioning
in
her
eyes
not
with
you
but
then
we
shall
often
go
to
the
lewis
yes
her
husband
said
often
as
we
can
conveniently
but
it
will
take
some
time
at
first
you
know
before
you
get
to
know
all
my
friends
who
are
to
be
your
friends
and
before
you
get
properly
fitted
into
our
social
circle
that
will
take
you
a
long
time
sheila
and
you
may
have
many
annoyances
or
embarrassments
to
encounter
but
you
be
very
much
afraid
my
girl
sheila
merely
looked
up
to
him
there
was
no
fear
in
the
frank
brave
eyes
the
first
large
town
she
saw
struck
a
cold
chill
to
her
heart
on
a
wet
and
dismal
afternoon
they
sailed
into
greenock
a
heavy
smoke
hung
about
the
black
and
the
dirty
quays
the
narrow
and
squalid
streets
were
filled
with
mud
and
only
the
poorer
sections
of
the
population
waded
through
the
mire
or
hung
disconsolately
about
the
corners
of
the
thoroughfares
a
gloomier
picture
could
not
well
be
conceived
and
sheila
chilled
with
the
long
and
wet
sail
and
bewildered
by
the
noise
and
bustle
of
the
harbor
was
driven
to
the
hotel
with
a
sore
heart
and
a
downcast
face
is
not
like
london
frank
she
said
pretty
nearly
ready
to
cry
with
disappointment
no
well
it
is
like
a
part
of
london
certainly
but
not
the
part
you
will
live
how
can
we
live
in
the
one
place
without
passing
the
other
and
being
made
miserable
by
it
there
was
no
part
of
oban
like
you
will
live
miles
away
from
the
docks
and
quays
of
london
you
might
live
for
a
lifetime
in
london
without
ever
knowing
it
had
a
harbor
you
be
afraid
sheila
you
will
live
in
a
district
where
there
are
far
finer
houses
than
any
you
saw
in
oban
and
far
finer
trees
and
within
a
few
walk
you
will
find
great
gardens
and
parks
with
lakes
in
them
and
wild
fowls
and
you
will
be
able
to
teach
the
boys
about
how
to
set
the
helm
and
the
sails
when
they
are
launching
their
small
should
like
that
said
sheila
her
face
brightening
you
would
like
a
boat
yourself
she
said
frankly
there
were
not
many
people
there
we
might
go
out
sometimes
in
the
evening
her
husband
laughed
and
took
her
hand
understand
sheila
the
boats
the
boys
have
are
little
things
a
foot
or
two
long
like
the
one
in
your
bedroom
in
borva
but
many
of
the
boys
would
be
greatly
obliged
to
you
if
you
would
teach
them
how
to
manage
the
sails
properly
for
sometimes
dreadful
shipwrecks
must
bring
them
to
our
house
i
am
very
fond
of
little
boys
when
they
begin
to
forget
to
be
shy
and
let
you
become
acquainted
with
said
lavender
know
many
of
the
boys
who
sail
boats
in
the
serpentine
you
will
have
to
make
their
acquaintance
yourself
but
i
know
one
boy
whom
i
must
bring
to
the
house
he
is
a
boy
who
is
going
to
be
another
mendelssohn
his
friends
say
he
is
a
pretty
boy
with
hair
big
black
eyes
and
a
fine
forehead
and
he
really
sings
and
plays
delightfully
but
you
know
sheila
you
must
not
treat
him
as
a
boy
for
he
is
over
fourteen
i
should
think
and
if
you
were
to
kiss
him
might
be
angry
said
sheila
with
perfect
simplicity
might
said
lavender
and
then
noticing
that
she
seemed
a
little
surprised
he
merely
patted
her
head
and
bade
her
go
and
get
ready
for
dinner
then
came
the
great
climax
of
southward
journey
her
arrival
in
london
she
was
all
anxiety
to
see
her
future
home
and
as
luck
would
have
it
there
was
a
fair
spring
morning
shining
over
the
city
for
a
couple
of
hours
before
she
had
sat
and
looked
out
of
the
as
the
train
whirled
rapidly
through
the
scarcely
awakened
country
and
she
had
seen
the
soft
and
beautiful
landscapes
of
the
south
lit
up
by
the
early
sunlight
how
the
bright
little
villages
shone
with
here
and
there
a
gilt
weathercock
glittering
on
the
spire
of
some
small
gray
church
while
as
yet
in
many
valleys
a
pale
gray
mist
lay
along
the
bed
of
the
level
streams
or
clung
to
the
dense
woods
on
the
upland
heights
which
was
the
more
beautiful
the
sharp
clear
picture
with
its
brilliant
colors
and
its
awakening
life
or
the
more
mystic
landscape
over
which
was
still
drawn
the
tender
veil
of
the
morning
haze
she
could
not
tell
she
only
knew
that
england
as
she
then
saw
it
seemed
a
great
country
that
was
very
beautiful
that
had
few
inhabitants
and
that
was
still
and
sleepy
and
bathed
in
sunshine
how
happy
must
the
people
be
who
lived
in
those
quiet
green
valleys
by
the
side
of
slow
and
smooth
rivers
and
amid
great
woods
and
avenues
and
stately
trees
the
like
of
which
she
had
not
imagined
in
her
dreams
but
from
the
moment
they
got
out
at
euston
square
she
seemed
a
trifle
bewildered
and
could
only
do
implicitly
as
her
husband
bade
her
clinging
to
his
hand
for
the
most
part
as
if
to
make
sure
of
guidance
she
did
indeed
glance
somewhat
nervously
at
the
hansom
into
which
lavender
put
her
apparently
asking
how
such
a
tall
and
narrow
vehicle
could
be
prevented
toppling
over
but
when
he
having
sent
on
all
their
luggage
by
a
respectable
old
got
into
the
hansom
beside
her
and
put
his
hand
inside
her
arm
and
bade
her
be
of
good
cheer
that
she
should
have
such
a
pleasant
morning
to
welcome
her
to
london
she
said
mechanically
and
only
looked
out
in
a
wistful
fashion
at
the
great
houses
and
trees
of
euston
square
the
mighty
and
roaring
stream
of
omnibuses
the
droves
of
strangers
mostly
clad
in
black
as
if
they
were
going
to
church
and
the
pale
blue
smoke
that
seemed
to
mix
with
the
sunshine
and
make
it
cold
and
distant
they
were
in
no
hurry
these
two
on
that
still
morning
and
so
to
impress
sheila
all
at
once
with
a
sense
of
the
greatness
and
grandeur
of
london
he
made
the
cabman
cut
down
by
park
crescent
and
portland
place
to
regent
circus
then
they
went
along
oxford
street
and
there
were
crowded
omnibuses
taking
young
men
into
the
city
while
all
the
pavements
were
busy
with
hurrying
passersby
what
multitudes
of
unknown
faces
unknown
to
her
and
unknown
to
each
other
these
people
did
not
speak
they
only
hurried
on
each
intent
upon
his
own
affairs
caring
nothing
apparently
for
the
din
around
them
and
looking
so
strange
and
sad
in
their
black
clothes
in
the
pale
and
misty
sunlight
are
in
a
trance
sheila
he
said
she
did
not
answer
surely
she
had
wandered
into
some
magical
city
for
now
the
houses
on
one
side
of
the
way
suddenly
ceased
and
she
saw
before
her
a
great
and
undulating
extent
of
green
with
a
border
of
beautiful
flowers
and
with
groups
of
trees
that
met
the
sky
all
along
the
southern
horizon
did
the
green
and
beautiful
country
she
had
seen
shoot
in
thus
into
the
heart
of
the
town
or
was
there
another
city
far
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
trees
the
place
was
almost
as
deserted
as
those
still
valleys
she
had
passed
by
in
the
morning
here
in
the
street
there
was
the
roar
of
a
passing
crowd
but
there
was
a
long
and
almost
deserted
stretch
of
park
with
winding
roads
and
umbrageous
trees
on
which
the
wan
sunlight
fell
from
between
loose
masses
of
cloud
then
they
passed
kensington
gardens
and
there
were
more
people
walking
down
the
broad
highways
between
the
elms
are
getting
nearly
home
now
sheila
he
said
you
will
be
able
to
come
and
walk
in
these
avenues
whenever
you
was
this
then
her
home
this
section
of
a
of
dwellings
all
alike
in
steps
pillars
doors
and
windows
when
she
got
inside
the
servant
who
had
opened
the
door
bobbed
a
curtsey
to
her
should
she
shake
hands
with
her
and
say
are
you
ferry
well
but
at
this
moment
lavender
came
running
up
the
steps
playfully
hurried
her
into
the
house
and
up
the
stairs
and
led
her
into
her
own
darling
what
do
you
think
of
your
home
now
that
you
see
it
sheila
looked
around
timidly
it
was
not
a
big
room
but
it
was
a
palace
in
height
and
grandeur
and
color
compared
with
that
little
museum
in
borva
in
which
piano
stood
it
was
all
so
strange
and
beautiful
the
split
pomegranates
and
quaint
leaves
on
the
upper
part
of
the
walls
and
underneath
a
dull
where
the
pictures
hung
the
curious
paintings
on
the
frames
of
the
mirrors
the
brilliant
curtains
with
their
stiff
and
formal
patterns
it
was
not
very
much
like
a
home
as
yet
it
was
more
like
a
picture
that
had
been
carefully
planned
and
executed
but
she
knew
how
he
had
thought
of
pleasing
her
in
choosing
these
things
and
without
saying
a
word
she
took
his
hand
and
kissed
it
and
then
she
went
to
one
of
the
three
tall
french
windows
and
looked
out
on
the
square
there
between
the
trees
was
a
space
of
beautiful
soft
green
and
some
children
dressed
in
bright
dresses
and
attended
by
a
governess
in
sober
black
had
just
begun
to
play
croquet
an
elderly
lady
with
a
small
white
dog
was
walking
along
one
end
of
the
graveled
paths
an
old
man
was
pruning
some
bushes
is
very
still
and
quiet
here
said
sheila
was
afraid
that
we
should
have
to
live
in
that
terrible
noise
hope
you
find
it
dull
my
darling
he
said
when
you
are
here
i
can
not
always
be
here
you
know
she
looked
up
see
a
man
is
so
much
in
the
way
if
he
is
dawdling
about
the
house
all
day
long
you
would
begin
to
regard
me
as
a
nuisance
sheila
and
would
be
for
sending
me
out
to
play
croquet
with
those
young
carruthers
merely
that
you
might
get
the
rooms
dusted
besides
you
know
i
work
here
i
must
have
a
studio
of
some
sort
in
the
neighborhood
of
course
and
then
you
will
give
me
your
orders
in
the
morning
as
to
when
i
am
to
come
round
for
luncheon
or
you
will
be
alone
all
day
at
your
work
i
will
come
and
sit
with
you
my
poor
boy
she
said
work
i
should
do
in
that
case
he
said
see
in
the
meantime
go
up
stairs
and
get
your
things
off
that
young
person
below
has
breakfast
ready
i
dare
you
have
not
shown
me
yet
where
ingram
lives
said
sheila
before
she
went
to
the
door
that
is
miles
away
you
have
only
seen
a
little
bit
of
london
yet
ingram
lives
about
as
far
away
from
here
as
the
distance
you
have
just
come
but
in
another
is
like
a
world
made
of
houses
said
sheila
all
filled
with
strangers
but
you
will
take
me
to
see
ingram
yes
but
he
is
sure
to
drop
in
on
you
as
soon
as
he
fancies
you
are
settled
in
your
new
and
here
at
last
was
ingram
come
and
the
mere
sound
of
his
voice
seemed
to
carry
her
back
to
borva
so
that
in
talking
to
him
and
waiting
on
him
as
of
old
she
would
scarcely
have
been
surprised
if
her
father
had
walked
in
to
say
that
a
coaster
was
making
for
the
harbor
or
that
duncan
was
going
over
to
stornoway
and
sheila
would
have
to
give
him
commissions
her
husband
did
not
take
the
same
interest
in
the
social
and
political
affairs
of
borva
that
ingram
did
lavender
had
made
a
pretence
of
assisting
sheila
in
her
work
among
the
poor
people
but
the
effort
was
a
hopeless
failure
he
could
not
remember
the
name
of
a
poor
family
that
wanted
a
new
boat
and
was
visibly
impatient
when
sheila
would
sit
down
to
write
out
for
some
aged
crone
a
letter
to
her
grandson
in
canada
now
ingram
for
the
mere
sake
of
occupation
had
qualified
himself
during
his
various
visits
to
lewis
so
that
he
might
have
become
the
home
minister
of
the
king
of
borva
and
sheila
was
glad
to
have
one
attentive
listener
as
she
described
all
the
wonderful
things
that
had
happened
in
the
island
since
the
previous
summer
but
ingram
had
got
a
full
and
complete
holiday
on
which
to
come
up
and
see
sheila
and
he
had
brought
with
him
the
wild
and
startling
proposal
that
in
order
that
she
should
take
her
first
plunge
into
the
pleasures
of
civilized
life
her
husband
and
herself
should
drive
down
to
richmond
and
dine
at
the
star
and
garter
is
that
said
sheila
dear
girl
said
the
husband
seriously
ignorance
is
something
fearful
to
contemplate
it
is
quite
bewildering
how
can
a
person
who
does
not
know
what
the
star
and
garter
is
be
told
what
the
star
and
garter
is
i
am
willing
to
go
and
see
said
sheila
i
must
look
after
getting
a
brougham
said
lavender
rising
brougham
on
such
a
day
as
this
exclaimed
ingram
get
an
open
trap
of
some
sort
and
sheila
just
to
please
me
will
put
on
that
very
blue
dress
she
used
to
wear
in
borva
and
the
hat
and
the
white
feather
if
she
has
got
you
would
like
me
to
put
on
a
sealskin
cap
and
a
red
handkerchief
instead
of
a
collar
observed
lavender
calmly
may
do
as
you
please
sheila
and
i
are
going
to
dine
at
the
star
and
i
put
on
that
blue
dress
said
the
girl
going
up
to
her
husband
of
course
if
you
like
said
lavender
meekly
going
off
to
order
the
carriage
and
wondering
by
what
route
he
could
drive
those
two
maniacs
down
to
richmond
so
that
none
of
his
friends
should
see
them
when
he
came
back
again
bringing
with
him
a
landau
which
could
be
shut
up
for
the
homeward
journey
at
night
he
had
to
confess
that
no
costume
seemed
to
suit
sheila
so
well
as
the
rough
and
he
was
so
pleased
with
her
appearance
that
he
consented
at
once
to
let
bras
go
with
them
in
the
carriage
on
condition
that
sheila
should
be
responsible
for
him
indeed
after
the
first
shiver
of
driving
away
from
the
square
was
over
he
forgot
that
there
was
much
unusual
about
the
look
of
his
odd
if
you
had
told
him
eighteen
months
before
that
on
a
bright
day
in
may
just
as
the
people
were
going
home
from
the
park
for
luncheon
he
would
go
for
a
drive
in
a
hired
trap
with
one
horse
his
companions
being
a
man
with
a
brown
a
girl
dressed
as
though
she
were
the
owner
of
a
yacht
and
an
immense
deerhound
and
that
in
this
fashion
he
would
dare
to
drive
up
to
the
star
and
garter
and
order
dinner
he
would
have
bet
five
hundred
to
one
that
such
a
thing
would
never
occur
so
long
as
he
preserved
his
senses
but
somehow
he
did
not
mind
much
he
was
very
much
at
home
with
those
two
people
beside
him
the
day
was
bright
and
fresh
the
horse
went
a
good
pace
and
once
they
were
over
hammersmith
bridge
and
out
among
fields
and
trees
the
country
looked
exceedingly
pretty
and
the
beauty
of
it
was
mirrored
in
eyes
quite
make
you
out
in
that
dress
sheila
he
said
am
not
sure
whether
it
is
real
and
or
a
theatrical
costume
i
have
seen
girls
on
ryde
pier
with
something
of
the
same
sort
on
only
a
good
deal
more
pronounced
you
know
and
they
looked
like
sham
yachtsmen
and
i
have
seen
stewardesses
wearing
that
color
and
texture
of
cloth
why
not
have
it
as
it
is
said
ingram
solitary
costume
produced
by
certain
conditions
of
climate
and
duties
acting
in
conjunction
with
a
natural
taste
for
harmonious
coloring
and
simple
form
that
dress
i
will
maintain
sprang
as
naturally
from
the
salt
sea
as
aphrodite
did
and
the
man
who
suspects
artifice
in
it
or
invention
has
had
his
mind
perverted
by
the
skepticism
of
modern
my
dress
so
very
wonderful
said
sheila
with
a
grave
complaisance
am
pleased
that
the
lewis
has
produced
such
a
fine
thing
and
perhaps
you
would
like
me
to
tell
you
its
history
it
was
my
papa
bought
a
piece
of
blue
serge
in
stornoway
it
cost
three
shillings
sixpence
a
yard
and
a
dressmaker
in
stornoway
cut
it
for
me
and
i
made
it
myself
that
is
all
the
history
of
the
wonderful
suddenly
sheila
seized
her
arm
they
had
got
down
to
the
river
by
mortlake
and
there
on
the
broad
bosom
of
the
stream
a
long
and
slender
boat
was
shooting
by
pulled
by
four
oarsmen
clad
in
white
flannel
can
they
go
out
in
such
a
boat
said
sheila
with
great
alarm
visible
in
her
eyes
is
scarcely
a
boat
at
all
and
if
they
touch
a
rock
or
the
wind
catches
them
be
frightened
sheila
said
her
husband
are
quite
safe
there
are
no
rocks
in
our
rivers
and
the
wind
does
not
give
us
squalls
here
like
those
on
loch
roag
you
will
see
hundreds
of
those
boats
by
and
by
and
perhaps
you
yourself
will
go
out
in
never
never
she
said
almost
with
a
shudder
if
the
people
here
heard
you
they
would
not
know
how
brave
a
sailor
you
are
you
are
not
afraid
to
go
out
at
night
by
yourself
on
the
sea
and
you
go
on
a
smooth
inland
river
those
boats
if
you
touch
them
they
must
go
she
seemed
glad
to
get
away
from
the
river
she
could
not
be
persuaded
of
the
safety
of
the
slender
craft
of
the
thames
and
indeed
for
some
time
after
seemed
so
strangely
depressed
that
lavender
begged
and
prayed
of
her
to
tell
him
what
was
the
matter
it
was
simple
enough
she
had
heard
him
speak
of
his
boating
adventures
was
it
in
such
boats
as
that
she
had
just
seen
and
might
he
not
be
some
day
going
out
in
one
of
them
and
an
accident
the
breaking
of
an
oar
a
gust
of
wind
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
reassure
her
by
a
solemn
promise
that
in
no
circumstances
whatever
would
he
lavender
go
into
a
boat
without
her
express
permission
whereupon
sheila
was
as
grateful
to
him
as
though
he
had
dowered
her
with
a
kingdom
this
was
not
the
richmond
hill
of
her
fancy
this
spacious
height
with
its
great
mansions
its
magnificent
elms
and
its
view
of
all
the
westward
and
wooded
country
with
the
streak
of
the
river
winding
through
the
green
foliage
where
was
the
farm
the
famous
lass
of
richmond
hill
must
have
lived
on
a
farm
but
here
surely
were
the
houses
of
great
lords
and
nobles
which
had
apparently
been
there
for
years
and
years
and
was
this
really
a
hotel
that
they
stopped
at
this
great
building
that
she
could
only
compare
to
stornoway
castle
sheila
said
lavender
after
they
had
ordered
dinner
and
gone
out
you
keep
a
tight
hold
on
that
leash
for
bras
will
see
strange
things
in
the
is
i
who
will
see
strange
things
she
said
and
the
prophecy
was
amply
fulfilled
for
as
they
went
along
the
broad
path
and
came
better
into
view
of
the
splendid
undulation
of
woodland
and
pasture
and
fern
when
on
the
one
hand
they
saw
the
thames
far
below
them
flowing
through
the
green
and
spacious
valley
and
on
the
other
hand
caught
some
dusky
glimpse
of
the
far
white
houses
of
london
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
got
into
a
new
world
and
that
this
world
was
far
more
beautiful
than
the
great
city
she
had
left
she
did
not
care
so
much
for
the
famous
view
from
the
hill
she
had
cast
one
quick
look
to
the
horizon
with
one
throb
of
expectation
that
the
sea
might
be
there
there
was
no
sea
there
only
the
faint
blue
of
long
lines
of
country
apparently
without
limit
moreover
over
the
western
landscape
a
faint
haze
prevailed
that
increased
in
the
distance
and
softened
down
the
more
distant
woods
into
a
sober
gray
that
great
extent
of
wooded
plain
lying
sleepily
in
its
pale
mists
was
not
so
cheerful
as
the
scene
around
her
where
the
sunlight
was
sharp
and
clear
the
air
fresh
the
trees
flooded
with
a
pure
and
bright
color
here
indeed
was
a
cheerful
and
beautiful
world
and
she
was
full
of
curiosity
to
know
all
about
it
and
its
strange
features
what
was
the
name
of
this
tree
and
how
did
it
differ
from
that
were
not
these
rabbits
over
by
the
fence
and
did
rabbits
live
in
the
midst
of
trees
and
bushes
what
sort
of
wood
was
the
fence
made
of
and
was
it
not
terribly
expensive
to
have
such
a
protection
could
not
he
tell
the
cost
of
a
wooden
fence
why
did
they
not
use
wire
netting
was
not
that
a
loch
away
down
there
and
what
was
its
name
a
loch
without
a
name
did
the
salmon
come
up
to
it
and
did
any
sea
birds
ever
come
inland
and
build
their
nests
on
its
margin
bras
you
must
come
and
look
at
the
loch
it
is
a
long
time
since
you
will
see
a
and
away
she
went
through
the
thick
breckan
holding
on
to
the
swaying
leash
that
held
the
galloping
grayhound
and
running
swiftly
as
though
she
had
been
making
down
for
the
shore
to
get
out
the
called
her
husband
be
foolish
called
ingram
pity
on
an
old
man
suddenly
she
stopped
a
brace
of
partridges
had
sprung
up
at
some
distance
and
with
a
wild
whirr
of
their
wings
were
now
directing
their
low
and
rapid
flight
toward
the
bottom
of
the
valley
birds
are
those
she
said
peremptorily
she
took
no
notice
of
the
fact
that
her
companions
were
pretty
nearly
too
blown
to
speak
there
was
a
brisk
life
and
color
in
her
face
and
all
her
attention
was
absorbed
in
watching
the
flight
of
the
birds
lavender
fancied
he
saw
in
the
fixed
and
keen
look
something
of
old
gray
eye
it
was
the
first
trace
of
a
likeness
to
her
father
he
had
seen
bad
girl
he
said
are
she
paid
no
heed
to
this
reproach
for
what
were
those
other
things
over
there
underneath
the
trees
bras
had
pricked
up
his
ears
and
there
was
a
strange
excitement
in
his
look
and
in
his
trembling
frame
she
cried
with
her
eyes
as
fixed
as
were
those
of
the
dog
beside
her
said
the
husband
calmly
although
they
are
deer
bras
she
said
and
with
that
she
caught
the
leash
with
both
her
hands
mind
them
if
you
keep
him
quiet
i
suppose
you
can
manage
him
better
than
i
can
i
wish
we
had
brought
a
would
rather
let
him
kill
every
deer
in
the
park
than
touch
him
with
a
whip
said
sheila
proudly
fearful
creature
you
know
what
you
say
that
is
high
treason
if
george
ranger
heard
you
he
would
have
you
hanged
in
front
of
the
star
and
is
george
ranger
said
sheila
with
an
air
as
if
she
had
said
you
know
that
i
am
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
borva
and
whoever
touches
me
will
have
to
answer
to
my
papa
who
is
not
afraid
of
any
george
ranger
is
a
great
lord
who
hangs
all
persons
who
disturb
the
deer
in
this
why
do
they
not
go
away
said
sheila
impatiently
have
never
seen
any
deer
so
stupid
it
is
their
own
fault
if
they
are
disturbed
why
do
they
remain
so
near
to
people
and
to
houses
dear
child
if
bras
here
you
would
probably
find
some
of
those
deer
coming
up
to
see
if
you
had
any
bits
of
sugar
or
pieces
of
bread
about
your
they
are
like
sheep
they
are
not
like
deer
she
said
with
some
contempt
i
could
only
tell
bras
that
it
is
sheep
he
will
be
looking
at
he
would
not
look
any
more
and
so
small
they
are
they
are
as
small
as
the
roe
but
they
have
horns
as
big
as
many
of
the
red
deer
do
people
eat
them
suppose
what
will
they
cost
am
sure
i
tell
they
as
good
as
the
roe
or
the
big
deer
know
that
either
i
think
i
ever
ate
but
you
know
they
are
not
kept
here
for
that
purpose
a
great
many
gentlemen
in
this
country
keep
a
lot
of
them
in
their
parks
merely
to
look
pretty
they
cost
a
great
deal
more
than
they
must
eat
up
a
great
deal
of
fine
grass
said
sheila
almost
sorrowfully
is
a
beautiful
ground
for
sheep
no
rushes
no
only
fine
good
grass
and
dry
land
i
should
like
my
papa
to
see
all
this
beautiful
fancy
he
has
seen
my
papa
here
think
he
said
did
he
see
those
deer
never
told
me
of
by
this
time
they
had
pretty
nearly
got
down
to
the
little
lake
and
bras
had
been
alternately
coaxed
and
threatened
into
a
quiescent
mood
sheila
evidently
expected
to
hear
a
flapping
of
wings
when
they
got
near
the
margin
and
looked
all
around
for
the
first
sudden
dart
from
the
banks
but
a
dead
silence
prevailed
and
as
there
were
neither
fish
nor
birds
to
watch
she
went
along
to
a
wooden
bench
and
sat
down
there
one
of
her
companions
on
each
hand
it
was
a
pretty
scene
that
lay
before
her
the
small
stretch
of
water
ruffled
with
the
wind
but
showing
a
dash
of
blue
sky
here
and
there
the
trees
in
the
inclosure
beyond
clad
in
their
summer
foliage
the
smooth
green
sward
shining
in
the
afternoon
sunlight
here
at
least
was
absolute
quiet
after
the
roar
of
london
and
it
was
somewhat
wistfully
that
she
asked
her
husband
how
far
this
place
was
from
her
home
and
whether
when
he
was
at
work
she
could
not
come
down
here
by
herself
he
said
never
dreaming
that
she
would
think
of
doing
such
a
thing
they
returned
to
the
hotel
and
while
they
sat
at
dinner
a
great
fire
of
sunset
spread
over
the
west
and
the
far
woods
became
of
a
rich
purple
streaked
here
and
there
with
lines
of
a
pale
white
mist
the
river
caught
the
glow
of
the
crimson
clouds
above
and
shone
duskily
red
amid
the
dark
green
of
the
trees
deeper
and
deeper
grew
the
color
of
the
sun
as
it
sank
to
the
horizon
until
it
disappeared
behind
one
low
bar
of
purple
cloud
and
the
wild
glow
in
the
west
slowly
faded
away
the
river
became
pallid
and
indistinct
the
white
mists
over
the
distant
woods
seemed
to
grow
denser
and
then
as
here
and
there
a
lamp
was
lit
far
down
in
the
valley
one
or
two
pale
stars
appeared
in
the
sky
overhead
and
the
night
came
on
apace
is
so
strange
sheila
said
find
the
darkness
coming
on
and
not
to
hear
the
sound
of
the
waves
i
wonder
if
it
is
a
fine
night
at
borva
her
husband
went
over
to
her
and
led
her
back
to
the
table
where
the
candles
shining
over
the
white
cloth
and
the
colored
glasses
offered
a
more
cheerful
picture
than
the
deepening
landscape
outside
they
were
in
a
private
room
so
that
when
dinner
was
over
sheila
was
allowed
to
amuse
herself
with
the
fruit
while
her
two
companions
lit
their
cigars
where
was
the
quaint
old
piano
now
and
the
glass
of
hot
whisky
and
water
and
the
of
or
in
thine
eyes
for
ever
plays
it
seemed
but
for
the
greatness
of
the
room
to
be
a
repetition
of
one
of
those
evenings
at
borva
that
now
belonged
to
a
far
off
past
here
was
sheila
not
minding
the
smoke
listening
to
ingram
as
of
old
and
sometimes
saying
something
in
that
sweetly
inflected
speech
of
hers
here
was
ingram
talking
as
it
were
out
of
a
brown
study
and
morosely
objecting
to
pretty
nearly
everything
lavender
said
but
always
ready
to
prove
sheila
right
and
lavender
himself
as
unlike
a
married
man
as
ever
talking
impatiently
impetuously
and
wildly
except
at
such
times
as
he
said
something
to
his
young
wife
and
then
some
brief
smile
and
look
or
some
pat
on
the
hand
said
more
than
words
but
where
sheila
may
have
thought
was
the
one
wanting
to
complete
the
group
has
he
gone
down
to
borvapost
to
see
about
the
cargoes
of
fish
to
be
sent
off
in
the
morning
perhaps
he
is
talking
to
duncan
outside
about
the
cleaning
of
the
guns
or
making
up
cartridges
in
the
kitchen
when
attention
wandered
away
from
the
talk
of
her
companions
she
could
not
help
listening
for
the
sound
of
the
waves
and
as
there
was
no
such
message
coming
to
her
from
the
great
wooded
plain
without
her
fancy
took
her
away
across
that
mighty
country
she
had
traveled
through
and
carried
her
up
to
the
island
of
loch
roag
until
she
almost
fancied
she
could
smell
the
in
the
night
air
and
listen
to
the
sea
and
hear
her
father
pacing
up
and
down
the
gravel
outside
the
house
perhaps
thinking
of
her
as
she
was
thinking
of
him
this
little
excursion
to
richmond
was
long
remembered
by
those
three
it
was
the
last
of
their
meetings
before
sheila
was
ushered
into
the
big
world
to
busy
herself
with
new
occupations
and
cares
it
was
a
pleasant
little
journey
throughout
for
as
they
got
into
the
landau
to
drive
back
to
town
the
moon
was
shining
high
up
in
the
southern
heavens
and
the
air
was
mild
and
fresh
so
that
they
had
the
carriage
opened
and
sheila
well
wrapped
up
lay
and
looked
around
her
with
a
strange
wonder
and
joy
as
they
drove
underneath
the
shadow
of
the
trees
and
out
again
into
the
clear
sheen
of
the
night
they
saw
the
river
too
flowing
smoothly
and
palely
down
between
its
dark
banks
and
somehow
here
the
silence
checked
them
and
they
hummed
no
more
those
duets
they
used
to
sing
up
at
borva
of
what
were
they
thinking
then
as
they
drove
through
the
clear
night
along
the
lonely
road
lavender
at
least
was
rejoicing
at
his
great
good
fortune
that
he
had
secured
for
ever
to
himself
the
girl
who
now
sat
opposite
to
him
with
the
moonlight
touching
her
face
and
hair
and
he
was
laughing
to
himself
at
the
notion
that
he
did
not
properly
appreciate
her
or
understand
her
or
perceive
her
real
character
if
not
he
who
then
had
he
not
watched
every
turn
of
her
disposition
every
expression
of
her
wishes
every
grace
of
her
manner
and
look
of
her
eyes
and
was
he
not
overjoyed
to
find
that
the
more
he
knew
of
her
the
more
he
loved
her
marriage
had
increased
rather
than
diminished
the
mystery
and
wonder
he
had
woven
about
her
he
was
more
her
lover
now
than
he
had
been
before
his
marriage
who
could
see
in
her
eyes
what
he
saw
elderly
folks
can
look
at
a
eyes
and
see
that
they
are
brown
or
blue
or
green
as
the
case
may
be
but
the
lover
looks
at
them
and
sees
in
them
the
magic
mirror
of
a
hundred
possible
worlds
how
can
he
fathom
the
sea
of
dreams
that
lies
there
or
tell
what
strange
fancies
or
reminiscences
may
be
involved
in
an
absent
look
is
she
thinking
of
starlit
nights
on
some
distant
lake
or
of
the
old
days
on
the
hills
all
her
former
life
is
told
there
and
yet
but
half
told
and
he
longs
to
become
possessed
of
all
the
beautiful
past
that
she
has
seen
here
is
a
constant
mystery
to
him
and
there
is
a
singular
and
wistful
attraction
for
him
in
those
still
deeps
where
the
thoughts
and
dreams
of
an
innocent
soul
lie
but
half
revealed
he
does
not
see
those
things
in
the
eyes
of
women
he
is
not
in
love
with
but
when
in
after
years
he
is
carelessly
regarding
this
or
the
other
woman
some
chance
look
some
brief
and
sudden
turn
of
expression
will
recall
to
him
as
with
a
stroke
of
lightning
all
the
old
and
his
heart
will
go
nigh
to
breaking
to
think
that
he
has
grown
old
and
that
he
has
forgotten
so
much
and
that
the
fair
wild
days
of
romance
and
longing
are
passed
away
forever
thinks
i
understand
you
yet
sheila
he
said
to
her
after
they
had
got
home
and
their
friends
had
gone
sheila
only
laughed
and
said
understand
myself
what
he
cried
you
mean
to
say
that
i
have
married
a
conundrum
if
i
have
i
mean
to
give
you
up
anyway
so
you
may
go
and
get
a
biscuit
and
a
drop
of
the
whisky
we
brought
from
the
north
with
chapter
xi
the
first
plunge
frank
lavender
was
a
good
deal
more
concerned
than
he
chose
to
show
about
the
effect
that
sheila
was
likely
to
produce
on
his
aunt
and
when
at
length
the
day
arrived
on
which
the
young
folks
were
to
go
down
to
kensington
gore
he
had
inwardly
to
confess
that
sheila
seemed
a
great
deal
less
perturbed
than
himself
her
perfect
calmness
and
surprised
him
the
manner
in
which
she
had
dressed
herself
with
certain
modifications
which
he
could
not
help
approving
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
time
seemed
to
him
a
miracle
of
dexterity
and
how
had
she
acquired
the
art
of
looking
at
ease
in
this
attire
which
was
much
more
cumbrous
than
she
had
usually
worn
in
borva
if
lavender
had
but
known
the
truth
he
would
have
begun
to
believe
something
of
what
ingram
had
vaguely
hinted
this
poor
girl
was
looking
toward
her
visit
to
kensington
gore
as
the
most
painful
trial
of
her
life
while
she
was
outwardly
calm
and
firm
and
even
cheerful
her
heart
sank
within
her
as
she
thought
of
the
dreaded
interview
those
garments
which
she
wore
with
such
an
appearance
of
ease
and
comfort
had
been
the
result
of
many
an
hour
of
anxiety
for
how
was
she
to
tell
from
her
raillery
what
colors
the
terrible
old
lady
in
kensington
would
probably
like
he
did
not
know
that
every
word
he
said
in
joke
about
his
temper
her
peevish
ways
the
awful
consequences
of
offending
her
and
so
forth
were
like
so
many
needles
stuck
into
the
heart
until
she
was
ready
to
cry
out
to
be
released
from
this
fearful
ordeal
moreover
as
the
day
came
near
what
he
could
not
see
in
her
she
saw
in
him
was
she
likely
to
be
reassured
when
she
perceived
that
her
husband
in
spite
of
all
his
fun
was
really
anxious
and
when
she
knew
that
some
blunder
on
her
part
might
ruin
him
in
fact
if
he
had
suspected
for
a
moment
that
she
was
really
trembling
to
think
of
what
might
happen
he
might
have
made
some
effort
to
give
her
courage
but
apparently
sheila
was
as
cool
and
collected
as
if
he
had
been
going
to
see
john
the
piper
he
believed
she
could
have
gone
to
be
presented
to
the
queen
without
a
single
tremor
of
heart
still
he
was
a
man
and
therefore
bound
to
assume
an
air
of
patronage
eat
you
really
he
said
to
sheila
as
they
were
driving
in
a
hansom
down
kensington
palace
gardens
you
have
got
to
do
is
to
believe
in
her
theories
of
food
she
make
you
a
martyr
to
them
she
measures
every
half
ounce
of
what
she
eats
but
she
starve
you
and
i
am
glad
to
think
sheila
that
you
have
brought
a
remarkably
good
and
sensible
appetite
with
you
from
the
lewis
oh
by
the
way
take
care
you
say
nothing
against
marcus
know
who
he
was
dear
observed
sheila
meekly
was
a
roman
emperor
and
a
philosopher
i
suppose
it
was
because
he
was
an
emperor
that
he
found
it
easy
to
be
a
philosopher
however
my
aunt
is
nuts
on
marcus
aurelius
i
beg
your
pardon
you
know
the
phrase
my
aunt
makes
marcus
aurelius
her
bible
and
she
is
sure
to
read
you
bits
from
him
which
you
must
believe
you
will
try
said
sheila
doubtfully
if
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
religion
i
think
anybody
knows
what
marcus
aurelius
means
so
you
may
as
well
believe
it
ingram
swears
by
him
but
he
is
always
full
of
odd
ingram
believe
in
marcus
aurelius
said
sheila
with
some
accession
of
interest
he
gave
my
aunt
the
book
years
ago
confound
him
and
ever
since
she
has
been
a
nuisance
to
her
friends
for
my
own
part
you
know
i
believe
that
marcus
aurelius
was
quite
such
an
ass
as
plato
he
talks
the
same
sort
of
perpetual
commonplaces
but
it
about
the
true
the
good
and
the
beautiful
would
you
like
me
to
repeat
one
of
the
dialogues
of
plato
about
the
immorality
of
cole
and
the
moral
effect
of
the
south
kensington
museum
dear
i
said
sheila
deprive
yourself
of
a
treat
but
never
mind
here
we
are
at
my
sheila
timidly
glanced
at
the
place
while
her
husband
paid
the
cabman
it
was
a
tall
narrow
house
of
dark
brick
with
some
ivy
at
the
foot
of
the
walls
and
with
crimson
curtains
formally
arranged
in
every
one
of
the
windows
if
mrs
lavender
was
a
rich
old
lady
why
did
she
live
in
such
a
gloomy
building
sheila
had
seen
beautiful
white
houses
in
all
parts
of
london
her
own
house
for
example
was
ever
so
much
more
cheerful
than
this
one
and
yet
she
had
heard
with
awe
of
the
value
of
this
depressing
little
mansion
in
kensington
gore
the
door
was
opened
by
a
man
who
showed
them
upstairs
and
announced
their
names
heart
beat
quickly
she
entered
the
with
a
sort
of
mist
before
her
eyes
and
found
herself
going
forward
to
a
lady
who
sat
at
the
farther
end
she
had
a
strangely
vivid
impression
amid
all
her
alarm
that
this
old
lady
looked
like
the
withered
kernel
of
a
nut
or
was
she
not
like
a
cockatoo
it
was
through
no
anticipation
of
dislike
to
mrs
lavender
that
the
imagination
of
the
girl
got
hold
of
that
notion
but
the
old
lady
held
her
head
like
a
cockatoo
what
was
there
moreover
about
the
decorations
of
her
head
that
reminded
one
of
a
cockatoo
when
it
puts
up
its
crest
and
causes
its
feathers
to
look
like
sticks
of
celery
caroline
this
is
my
am
glad
to
see
you
dear
said
the
old
lady
giving
her
hand
but
not
rising
down
when
you
are
a
little
nervous
you
ought
to
sit
down
frank
give
me
that
ammonia
from
the
it
was
a
small
glass
phial
and
labeled
she
smelt
the
stopper
and
then
handed
it
to
sheila
telling
her
to
do
the
same
did
your
maid
do
your
hair
in
such
a
way
she
asked
suddenly
got
a
maid
said
sheila
i
always
do
my
hair
be
offended
i
like
it
but
you
must
not
make
a
fool
of
yourself
your
hair
is
too
much
that
of
a
country
beauty
going
to
a
ball
paterson
will
show
you
how
to
do
your
i
say
aunt
cried
lavender
with
a
fine
show
of
carelessness
go
and
spoil
her
hair
i
think
it
is
very
pretty
as
it
is
and
that
woman
of
yours
would
simply
go
and
make
a
mop
of
it
think
the
girls
nowadays
dressed
their
hair
by
shoving
their
head
into
a
furze
bush
and
giving
it
a
couple
of
she
paid
no
heed
to
him
but
turned
to
sheila
and
said
are
an
only
child
did
you
leave
your
father
the
question
was
rather
a
cruel
one
and
it
stung
sheila
into
answering
bravely
my
husband
wished
you
think
your
husband
is
to
be
the
first
law
of
your
life
i
when
he
is
only
silly
frank
lavender
sheila
rose
there
was
a
quivering
of
her
lips
but
no
weakness
in
the
proud
indignant
look
of
her
eyes
you
may
say
of
me
that
i
do
not
care
but
i
will
not
remain
to
hear
my
husband
said
lavender
vexed
and
anxious
and
yet
pleased
at
the
same
time
by
the
courage
of
the
girl
it
is
only
a
joke
you
must
not
mind
it
is
only
a
bit
of
do
not
understand
such
jests
she
said
calmly
down
like
a
good
girl
said
the
old
lady
with
an
air
of
absolute
indifference
did
not
mean
to
offend
you
sit
down
and
be
quiet
you
will
destroy
your
nervous
system
if
you
give
way
to
such
impulses
i
think
you
are
healthy
i
like
the
look
of
you
but
you
will
never
reach
a
good
age
as
i
hope
to
do
except
by
moderating
your
passions
that
is
well
now
take
the
ammonia
again
and
give
it
to
me
you
wish
to
die
young
i
suppose
am
not
afraid
of
dying
said
sheila
the
bell
he
did
so
and
a
tall
spare
woman
appeared
you
must
put
luncheon
on
at
i
ordered
it
at
did
i
not
that
it
is
served
at
and
take
this
young
lady
and
get
her
hair
properly
done
you
understand
my
nephew
and
i
will
wait
luncheon
for
sheila
rose
with
a
great
swelling
in
her
throat
all
her
courage
had
ebbed
away
she
had
reflected
how
pained
her
husband
would
be
if
she
did
not
please
this
old
lady
and
she
was
now
prepared
to
do
anything
she
was
told
to
receive
meekly
any
remarks
that
might
be
made
to
her
to
be
quite
obedient
and
gentle
and
submissive
but
what
was
this
tall
and
terrible
woman
going
to
do
to
her
did
she
really
mean
to
cut
away
those
great
masses
of
hair
to
which
mrs
lavender
had
objected
sheila
would
have
let
her
hair
be
cut
willingly
for
her
sake
but
as
she
went
to
the
door
some
wild
and
despairing
notions
came
into
her
head
of
what
her
husband
might
think
of
her
when
once
she
was
shorn
of
this
beautiful
personal
feature
would
he
look
at
her
with
surprise
perhaps
even
with
disappointment
you
keep
luncheon
late
he
said
to
her
as
she
passed
him
she
but
indistinctly
heard
him
so
great
was
the
trembling
within
her
her
father
would
scarcely
know
his
altered
sheila
when
she
went
back
to
borva
and
what
would
mairi
say
mairi
who
had
many
a
time
helped
her
to
arrange
those
long
tresses
and
who
was
as
proud
of
them
as
if
they
were
her
own
she
followed
tall
maid
she
entered
a
small
and
glanced
nervously
around
then
she
suddenly
turned
looked
for
a
moment
at
the
woman
and
said
with
tears
rushing
up
into
her
eyes
mrs
lavender
wish
me
to
cut
my
hair
the
woman
regarded
her
with
astonishment
miss
i
beg
your
pardon
no
not
at
all
i
suppose
it
is
only
some
difference
in
the
arrangement
mrs
lavender
is
very
particular
about
the
hair
and
she
has
asked
me
to
show
several
ladies
how
to
dress
the
hair
in
the
way
she
likes
but
perhaps
you
would
prefer
letting
it
remain
as
it
is
no
not
at
all
said
sheila
should
like
to
have
it
just
as
mrs
lavender
wishes
in
every
way
just
as
she
wishes
only
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
cut
any
no
miss
and
it
would
be
a
great
pity
if
i
may
say
so
to
cut
sheila
was
pleased
to
hear
that
here
was
a
woman
who
had
a
large
experience
in
such
matters
among
those
very
ladies
of
her
social
circle
whom
she
had
been
a
little
afraid
to
meet
paterson
seemed
to
admire
her
hair
as
much
as
the
simple
mairi
had
done
and
sheila
soon
began
to
have
less
fear
of
the
terrible
tiring
woman
who
forthwith
proceeded
with
her
task
the
young
wife
went
down
stairs
with
a
tower
upon
her
head
she
was
very
uncomfortable
she
had
seen
it
is
true
that
this
method
of
dressing
the
hair
really
became
her
or
rather
would
become
her
in
certain
circumstances
it
was
grand
imposing
statuesque
but
then
she
did
not
feel
statuesque
just
at
this
moment
she
could
have
dressed
herself
to
suit
this
style
of
hair
she
could
have
worn
it
with
confidence
if
she
had
got
it
up
herself
but
here
she
was
the
victim
of
an
experiment
she
felt
like
a
school
girl
about
for
the
first
time
to
appear
in
public
in
a
long
dress
and
she
was
terribly
afraid
her
husband
would
laugh
at
her
if
he
had
any
such
inclination
he
courteously
suppressed
it
he
said
the
massive
simplicity
of
this
dressing
of
the
hair
suited
her
admirably
mrs
lavender
said
that
paterson
was
an
invaluable
woman
and
then
they
went
down
to
the
on
the
ground
floor
where
luncheon
had
been
laid
the
man
who
had
opened
the
door
waited
on
the
two
strangers
the
invaluable
paterson
acted
as
a
sort
of
to
her
mistress
standing
by
her
chair
and
supplying
her
wants
she
also
had
the
management
of
a
small
pair
of
silver
scales
in
which
pretty
nearly
everything
that
mrs
lavender
took
in
the
way
of
solid
food
was
carefully
and
accurately
weighed
the
conversation
was
chiefly
alimentary
and
sheila
listened
with
a
growing
wonder
to
the
description
of
the
devices
by
which
the
ladies
of
acquaintances
were
wont
to
cheat
fatigue
or
win
an
appetite
or
preserve
their
color
when
by
accident
the
girl
herself
was
appealed
to
she
had
to
confess
to
an
astonishing
ignorance
of
all
such
resources
she
knew
nothing
of
the
relative
strengths
and
effects
of
wines
though
she
was
frankly
ready
to
make
any
experiment
her
husband
recommended
she
knew
what
camphor
was
but
had
never
heard
of
bismuth
on
she
had
to
admit
that
did
not
seem
to
her
likely
to
be
a
pleasant
liquor
before
going
to
a
ball
did
she
not
know
the
effect
on
brown
hair
of
washing
it
in
every
night
she
was
equably
confessing
her
ignorance
on
all
such
points
when
she
was
startled
by
a
sudden
question
from
mrs
lavender
did
she
know
what
she
was
doing
she
looked
at
her
plate
there
was
on
it
a
piece
of
cheese
to
which
she
had
thoughtlessly
helped
herself
somebody
had
called
it
roquefort
that
was
all
she
knew
have
as
much
there
child
as
would
kill
a
ploughman
and
i
suppose
you
would
not
have
had
the
sense
to
leave
it
poison
said
sheila
regarding
her
plate
with
horror
cheese
is
paterson
my
she
had
plate
brought
to
her
and
the
proper
modicum
of
cheese
cut
weighed
and
sent
back
whatever
house
you
are
in
never
to
have
more
roquefort
than
would
be
simpler
to
do
without
said
sheila
would
be
simple
enough
to
do
without
a
great
many
things
said
mrs
lavender
severely
the
wisdom
of
living
is
to
enjoy
as
many
different
things
as
possible
so
long
as
you
do
so
in
moderation
and
preserve
your
health
you
are
young
you
think
of
such
things
you
think
because
you
have
good
teeth
and
a
clear
complexion
you
can
eat
anything
but
that
last
a
time
will
come
do
you
not
know
what
the
great
emperor
marcus
antoninus
says
a
little
while
thou
wilt
be
nobody
and
nowhere
like
hadrianus
and
said
sheila
she
had
not
enjoyed
her
luncheon
much
she
would
rather
have
had
a
ham
sandwich
and
a
glass
of
spring
water
on
the
side
of
a
highland
hill
than
this
varied
and
fastidious
repast
accompanied
by
a
good
deal
of
physiology
but
it
was
too
bad
that
having
successfully
got
through
it
she
should
be
threatened
with
annihilation
immediately
afterward
it
was
no
sort
of
consolation
to
her
to
know
that
she
would
be
in
the
same
plight
with
two
emperors
you
can
go
and
smoke
a
cigar
in
the
conservatory
if
you
please
your
wife
will
come
with
me
and
have
a
sheila
would
much
rather
have
gone
into
the
conservatory
also
but
she
obediently
followed
mrs
lavender
and
into
the
it
was
rather
a
melancholy
chamber
the
curtains
shutting
out
most
of
the
daylight
and
leaving
you
in
a
that
made
the
place
look
big
and
vague
and
spectral
the
little
shrivelled
woman
with
the
hard
and
staring
eyes
and
hair
bade
sheila
sit
down
beside
her
she
herself
sat
by
a
small
table
on
which
there
were
a
tiny
pair
of
scales
a
bottle
of
ammonia
a
fan
and
a
book
bound
in
an
binding
of
scarlet
morocco
and
gold
sheila
wished
this
old
woman
would
not
look
at
her
so
she
wished
there
was
a
window
open
or
a
glint
of
sunlight
coming
in
somewhere
but
she
was
glad
that
her
husband
was
enjoying
himself
in
the
conservatory
and
that
for
two
reasons
one
of
them
was
that
she
did
not
like
the
tone
of
his
talk
while
he
and
his
aunt
had
been
conversing
together
about
the
cosmetics
and
such
matters
not
only
did
he
betray
a
marvelous
acquaintance
with
such
things
but
he
seemed
to
take
an
odd
sort
of
pleasure
in
exhibiting
his
knowledge
he
talked
about
the
tricks
of
fashionable
women
in
a
mocking
way
that
sheila
did
not
quite
like
and
of
course
she
naturally
threw
the
blame
on
mrs
lavender
it
was
only
when
this
old
lady
exerted
a
godless
influence
over
him
that
her
good
boy
talked
in
such
a
fashion
there
was
nothing
of
that
about
him
in
lewis
nor
yet
at
home
in
a
certain
snug
little
which
these
two
had
come
to
consider
the
most
comfortable
corner
in
the
house
sheila
began
to
hate
women
who
used
and
silently
recorded
a
vow
that
never
never
never
would
she
wear
hair
but
her
own
you
suffer
from
headaches
said
mrs
lavender
abruptly
said
sheila
often
what
is
an
average
two
a
week
sometimes
i
have
not
a
headache
for
three
or
four
months
at
a
toothache
did
your
mother
die
of
was
a
fever
said
sheila
in
a
low
voice
she
caught
it
while
she
was
helping
a
family
that
was
very
bad
with
the
your
father
ever
suffer
from
rheumatism
said
sheila
papa
is
the
strongest
man
in
the
lewis
i
am
sure
of
the
strongest
of
us
you
know
said
mrs
lavender
looking
hardly
at
the
girl
strongest
of
us
will
die
and
go
into
the
general
order
of
the
universe
and
it
is
a
good
thing
for
you
that
as
you
say
you
are
not
afraid
why
should
you
be
afraid
listen
to
this
she
opened
the
red
book
and
guided
herself
to
a
certain
page
by
one
of
a
series
of
colored
ribbons
who
fears
death
either
fears
the
loss
of
sensation
or
a
different
kind
of
sensation
but
if
thou
shalt
have
no
sensation
neither
wilt
thou
feel
any
harm
and
if
thou
shalt
acquire
another
kind
of
sensation
thou
will
be
a
different
kind
of
living
being
and
thou
wilt
not
cease
to
do
you
perceive
the
wisdom
of
that
said
sheila
and
her
own
voice
seemed
hollow
and
strange
to
her
in
this
big
and
chamber
mrs
lavender
turned
over
a
few
more
pages
and
proceeded
to
read
again
and
as
she
did
so
in
a
slow
unsympathetic
monotonous
voice
a
spell
came
over
the
girl
the
weight
at
her
heart
grew
more
and
more
intolerable
and
the
room
seemed
to
grow
darker
then
is
the
time
which
every
man
lives
and
small
the
nook
of
the
earth
where
he
lives
and
short
too
the
longest
posthumous
fame
and
even
this
only
continued
by
a
succession
of
poor
human
beings
who
will
very
soon
die
and
who
know
not
even
themselves
much
less
him
who
died
long
you
can
not
do
better
than
ask
your
husband
to
buy
you
a
copy
of
this
book
and
give
it
special
study
it
will
comfort
you
in
affliction
and
reconcile
you
to
whatever
may
happen
to
you
listen
will
the
earth
cover
us
all
then
the
earth
too
will
change
and
the
things
also
which
result
from
change
will
continue
to
change
forever
and
these
again
forever
for
if
a
man
reflects
on
the
changes
and
transformations
which
follow
one
another
like
wave
after
wave
and
with
their
rapidity
he
will
despise
everything
which
is
do
you
understand
that
said
sheila
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
being
suffocated
would
not
the
gray
walls
burst
asunder
and
show
her
one
glimpse
of
the
blue
sky
before
she
sank
into
unconsciousness
the
monotonous
tones
of
this
old
voice
sounded
like
the
repetition
of
a
psalm
over
a
coffin
it
was
as
if
she
was
already
shut
out
of
life
and
could
only
hear
in
a
vague
way
the
dismal
words
being
chanted
over
her
by
the
people
in
the
other
world
she
rose
steadied
herself
for
a
moment
by
placing
her
hand
on
the
back
of
the
chair
and
managed
to
say
lavender
forgive
me
for
one
moment
i
wish
to
speak
to
my
she
went
to
the
door
mrs
lavender
being
too
surprised
to
follow
her
and
made
her
way
down
stairs
she
had
seen
the
conservatory
at
the
end
of
a
certain
passage
she
reached
it
and
then
she
scarcely
knew
any
more
except
that
her
husband
caught
her
in
his
arms
as
she
cried
frank
frank
take
me
away
from
this
house
i
am
afraid
it
terrifies
me
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
here
come
out
into
the
fresh
air
by
jove
how
pale
you
are
will
you
have
some
water
he
could
not
get
to
understand
thoroughly
what
had
occurred
what
he
clearly
did
learn
from
disjointed
and
timid
explanations
was
that
there
had
been
another
and
he
knew
that
of
all
things
in
the
world
his
aunt
hated
the
worst
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
there
was
little
the
matter
with
sheila
beyond
considerable
mental
perturbation
he
could
not
help
addressing
some
little
remonstrance
to
her
and
reminding
her
how
necessary
it
was
that
she
should
not
offend
the
old
lady
should
not
be
so
excitable
sheila
he
said
take
such
exaggerated
notions
about
things
i
am
sure
my
aunt
meant
nothing
unkind
and
what
did
you
say
when
you
came
away
said
i
wanted
to
see
you
are
you
angry
with
me
of
course
not
but
then
you
see
it
is
a
little
vexing
just
at
this
moment
well
let
us
go
at
once
and
try
to
make
up
some
excuse
like
a
good
girl
say
you
felt
faint
you
will
come
with
me
now
do
try
sheila
to
make
friends
with
my
aunt
she
is
not
such
a
bad
sort
of
creature
as
you
seem
to
think
been
very
kind
to
me
be
very
kind
to
you
when
she
knows
you
fortunately
no
excuse
was
necessary
for
mrs
lavender
in
absence
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
the
temporary
faintness
was
due
to
that
piece
of
roquefort
see
you
must
be
careful
she
said
when
they
entered
the
room
are
unaccustomed
to
a
great
many
things
you
will
like
the
room
is
a
little
close
said
lavender
think
so
said
his
aunt
sharply
at
the
mean
for
you
and
me
aunt
caroline
he
said
for
her
sheila
has
been
accustomed
to
live
almost
wholly
in
the
open
open
air
in
moderation
is
an
excellent
thing
i
go
out
myself
every
afternoon
wet
or
dry
and
i
was
going
to
propose
frank
that
you
should
leave
her
here
with
me
for
the
afternoon
and
come
back
and
dine
with
us
at
seven
i
am
going
out
at
and
she
could
go
with
very
kind
of
you
aunt
caroline
but
we
have
promised
to
call
on
some
people
close
by
here
at
sheila
looked
up
frightened
the
statement
was
an
audacious
perversion
of
the
truth
but
then
frank
lavender
knew
very
well
what
his
aunt
meant
by
going
into
the
open
air
every
afternoon
wet
or
dry
at
one
certain
hour
her
brougham
was
brought
around
she
got
into
it
and
had
both
doors
and
windows
hermetically
sealed
and
then
in
a
state
she
was
driven
slowly
and
monotonously
around
the
park
how
would
sheila
fare
if
she
were
shut
up
in
this
box
he
told
a
lie
with
great
equanimity
and
saved
her
then
sheila
was
taken
away
to
get
on
her
things
and
her
husband
waited
with
some
little
trepidation
to
hear
what
his
aunt
would
say
about
her
he
had
not
long
to
wait
got
a
bad
temper
i
think
so
aunt
caroline
he
said
considerably
startled
my
words
got
a
bad
temper
and
she
is
not
nearly
so
soft
as
she
tries
to
make
out
that
girl
has
a
great
deal
of
firmness
find
her
as
gentle
and
submissive
as
a
girl
could
be
a
little
too
gentle
perhaps
and
anxious
to
study
the
wishes
of
other
is
all
very
well
with
you
you
are
her
master
she
is
not
likely
to
quarrel
with
her
bread
and
butter
but
see
if
she
does
not
hold
her
own
when
she
gets
among
your
hope
she
will
hold
her
the
old
lady
only
shook
her
head
am
sorry
you
should
have
taken
a
prejudice
against
her
aunt
caroline
said
the
young
man
humbly
take
a
prejudice
let
me
hear
the
word
again
frank
you
know
i
have
no
prejudices
if
i
can
not
give
you
a
reason
for
anything
i
believe
then
i
cease
to
believe
have
not
heard
her
sing
he
said
suddenly
remembering
that
this
means
of
conquering
the
old
lady
had
been
neglected
have
no
doubt
she
has
many
accomplishments
said
aunt
caroline
coldly
time
i
suppose
she
will
get
over
that
extraordinary
accent
she
people
like
dare
say
you
do
at
present
but
you
may
tire
of
it
you
married
her
in
a
hurry
and
you
have
not
got
rid
of
your
romance
yet
at
the
same
time
i
dare
say
she
is
a
very
good
sort
of
girl
and
will
not
disgrace
you
if
you
instruct
and
manage
her
properly
but
remember
my
words
she
has
a
temper
and
you
will
find
it
out
if
you
thwart
how
sweet
and
fresh
the
air
was
even
in
kensington
when
sheila
having
dressed
and
come
down
stairs
and
after
having
dutifully
kissed
mrs
lavender
and
bade
her
went
outside
with
her
husband
it
was
like
coming
back
to
the
light
of
day
from
inside
the
imaginary
coffin
in
which
she
had
fancied
herself
placed
a
soft
west
wind
was
blowing
over
the
park
and
a
fairly
clear
sunlight
shining
on
the
may
green
of
the
trees
and
then
she
hung
on
her
arm
and
she
had
him
to
speak
to
instead
of
the
terrible
old
woman
who
talked
about
dying
and
yet
she
hoped
she
had
not
offended
mrs
lavender
for
sake
what
he
thought
about
the
matter
he
prudently
resolved
to
conceal
you
know
that
you
have
greatly
pleased
my
aunt
he
said
without
the
least
compunction
he
knew
that
if
he
breathed
the
least
hint
about
what
had
actually
been
said
any
possibly
amity
between
the
two
women
would
be
rendered
impossible
forever
i
really
said
sheila
very
much
astonished
but
never
thinking
for
a
moment
of
doubting
anything
said
by
her
husband
she
likes
you
awfully
he
said
with
an
infinite
coolness
am
so
glad
said
sheila
with
her
face
brightening
was
so
afraid
dear
i
had
offended
her
she
did
not
look
pleased
with
by
this
time
they
had
got
into
a
hansom
and
were
driving
down
to
the
south
kensington
museum
lavender
would
have
preferred
going
into
the
park
but
what
if
his
aunt
in
driving
by
were
to
see
them
he
explained
to
sheila
the
absolute
necessity
of
his
having
to
tell
that
fib
about
the
four
engagement
and
when
she
heard
described
the
drive
in
the
closed
brougham
which
she
had
escaped
perhaps
she
was
not
so
greatly
inclined
as
she
ought
to
have
been
to
protest
against
that
piece
of
wickedness
yes
she
likes
you
awfully
he
repeated
you
must
get
to
like
her
be
frightened
at
her
harsh
way
of
saying
things
it
is
only
a
mannerism
she
is
really
a
woman
and
would
do
anything
for
me
her
best
feature
looking
at
her
character
from
my
point
of
often
must
we
go
to
see
her
asked
sheila
not
very
often
but
she
will
get
up
dinner
parties
at
which
you
will
be
introduced
to
batches
of
her
friends
and
then
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
put
yourself
under
her
instructions
and
take
her
advice
about
your
dress
and
such
matters
just
as
you
did
about
your
hair
that
was
very
good
of
am
glad
you
were
pleased
with
me
said
sheila
will
do
what
i
can
to
like
her
but
she
must
talk
more
respectfully
of
lavender
laughed
that
little
matter
off
as
a
joke
but
it
was
no
joke
to
sheila
she
would
try
to
like
that
old
woman
yes
her
duty
to
her
husband
demanded
that
she
should
but
there
are
some
things
that
a
wife
especially
a
girl
who
has
been
newly
made
a
wife
will
never
forget
which
on
the
contrary
she
will
remember
with
burning
cheeks
and
anger
and
indignation

transformation
had
sheila
then
lavender
could
not
help
asking
himself
a
bad
temper
or
any
other
qualities
and
characteristics
which
were
apparent
to
other
people
but
not
to
him
was
it
possible
that
after
all
ingram
was
right
and
that
he
had
yet
to
learn
the
nature
of
the
girl
he
had
married
it
would
be
unfair
to
say
that
he
suspected
something
wrong
about
his
wife
that
he
fancied
she
had
managed
to
conceal
something
merely
because
mrs
lavender
had
said
that
sheila
had
a
bad
temper
but
here
was
another
person
who
maintained
that
when
the
days
of
his
romance
were
over
he
would
see
the
girl
in
another
light
nay
as
he
continued
to
ask
himself
had
not
the
change
already
begun
he
grew
less
and
less
accustomed
to
see
in
sheila
a
beautiful
wild
that
had
fluttered
down
for
a
time
into
a
strange
home
in
the
south
he
had
not
quite
forgotten
or
abandoned
those
imaginative
scenes
in
which
the
wonderful
was
to
enter
crowded
and
have
all
the
world
standing
back
to
regard
her
and
admire
her
and
sing
her
praises
but
now
he
was
not
so
sure
that
that
would
be
the
result
of
entrance
into
society
as
the
date
of
a
certain
drew
near
he
began
to
wish
she
was
more
like
the
women
he
knew
he
did
not
object
to
her
strange
sweet
ways
of
speech
nor
to
her
odd
likes
and
dislikes
nor
even
to
an
unhesitating
frankness
that
nearly
approached
rudeness
sometimes
in
its
scorn
of
all
compromise
with
the
truth
but
how
would
others
regard
these
things
he
did
not
wish
to
gain
the
reputation
of
having
married
an
oddity
he
said
on
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
they
were
going
to
this
should
not
say
there
are
only
two
syllables
in
it
really
does
sound
absurd
to
hear
you
say
she
looked
up
to
him
with
a
quick
trouble
in
her
eyes
when
had
he
spoken
to
her
so
petulantly
before
and
then
she
cast
down
her
eyes
again
and
said
submissively
will
try
not
to
speak
like
that
when
you
go
out
i
take
a
book
and
read
aloud
and
try
to
speak
like
you
but
i
can
not
learn
all
at
mind
he
said
you
know
other
people
must
think
it
so
odd
i
wonder
why
you
should
always
say
for
now
when
it
is
just
as
easy
to
say
once
upon
a
time
he
had
said
there
was
no
english
like
the
english
spoken
in
lewis
and
had
singled
out
this
very
word
as
typical
of
one
peculiarity
in
the
pronunciation
but
she
did
not
remind
him
of
that
she
only
said
in
the
same
simple
fashion
you
will
tell
me
my
faults
i
will
try
to
correct
she
turned
away
from
him
to
get
an
envelope
for
a
letter
she
had
been
writing
to
her
father
he
fancied
something
was
wrong
and
perhaps
some
touch
of
compunction
smote
him
for
he
went
after
her
and
took
her
hand
and
said
here
sheila
when
i
point
out
any
trifles
like
that
you
must
not
call
them
faults
and
fancy
that
i
have
any
serious
complaint
to
make
it
is
for
your
own
good
that
you
should
meet
the
people
who
will
be
your
friends
on
equal
terms
and
give
them
as
little
as
possible
to
talk
should
not
mind
their
talking
about
me
said
sheila
with
her
eyes
still
cast
down
it
is
your
wife
they
must
not
talk
about
and
if
you
will
tell
me
anything
i
do
wrong
i
will
correct
you
must
not
think
it
is
anything
so
serious
as
that
you
will
soon
pick
up
from
the
ladies
you
will
meet
some
notion
of
how
you
differ
from
them
and
if
you
should
startle
or
puzzle
them
a
little
at
first
by
talking
about
the
chances
of
the
fishing
or
the
catching
of
wild
duck
or
the
way
to
reclaim
you
will
soon
get
over
all
sheila
said
nothing
but
she
made
a
mental
memorandum
of
three
things
she
was
not
to
speak
about
she
did
not
know
why
these
subjects
should
be
forbidden
but
she
was
in
a
strange
land
and
going
to
see
strange
people
whose
habits
were
different
from
hers
moreover
when
her
husband
had
gone
she
reflected
that
these
people
having
no
fishing
and
and
no
could
not
possibly
be
interested
in
such
affairs
and
thus
she
fancied
she
perceived
the
reason
why
she
should
avoid
all
mention
of
these
things
when
in
the
evening
sheila
came
down
dressed
and
ready
to
go
out
lavender
had
to
admit
to
himself
that
he
had
married
an
exceedingly
beautiful
girl
and
that
there
was
no
country
gawkiness
about
her
manner
and
no
placid
insipidity
about
her
proud
and
handsome
face
for
one
brief
moment
he
triumphed
in
his
heart
and
had
some
wild
glimpse
of
his
old
project
of
startling
his
small
world
with
this
vision
from
the
northern
seas
but
when
he
got
into
the
hired
brougham
and
thought
of
the
people
he
was
about
to
meet
and
of
the
manner
in
which
they
would
carry
away
such
and
such
impressions
of
the
girl
he
lost
faith
in
that
admiration
he
would
much
rather
have
had
sheila
unnoticeable
and
unnoticed
one
who
would
quietly
take
her
place
at
the
and
attract
no
more
special
attention
than
the
flowers
for
example
which
every
one
would
glance
at
with
some
satisfaction
and
then
forget
in
the
interest
of
talking
and
dining
he
was
quite
conscious
of
his
own
weakness
in
thus
fearing
social
criticism
he
knew
that
ingram
would
have
taken
sheila
anywhere
in
her
blue
serge
dress
and
been
quite
content
and
oblivious
of
observation
but
then
ingram
was
independent
of
these
social
circles
in
which
a
married
man
must
move
and
in
which
his
position
is
often
defined
for
him
by
the
disposition
and
manners
of
his
wife
ingram
did
not
know
how
women
talked
it
was
for
own
sake
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
was
anxious
about
the
impression
she
should
make
and
that
he
had
drilled
her
in
all
that
she
should
do
and
say
all
things
he
said
you
take
no
notice
of
me
another
man
will
take
you
in
to
dinner
of
course
and
i
shall
take
in
somebody
else
and
we
shall
not
be
near
each
other
but
after
dinner
i
mean
when
the
men
go
into
the
you
come
and
speak
to
me
or
take
any
notice
of
me
i
look
at
you
frank
you
do
have
half
a
dozen
people
all
watching
you
saying
to
themselves
or
to
each
other
thing
she
got
over
her
infatuation
yet
it
pretty
to
see
how
naturally
her
eyes
turn
toward
him
i
mind
them
saying
that
said
sheila
with
a
smile
you
be
pitied
in
that
fashion
let
them
keep
their
compassion
to
you
know
dear
said
sheila
very
quietly
i
think
you
exaggerate
the
interest
people
will
take
in
me
i
think
i
can
be
of
such
importance
to
them
i
think
they
will
be
watching
me
as
you
you
know
he
said
know
they
fancy
i
have
done
something
romantic
heroic
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
and
they
are
curious
to
see
can
not
hurt
me
by
looking
at
me
said
sheila
simply
they
will
soon
find
out
how
little
there
is
to
the
house
being
in
holland
park
they
had
not
far
to
go
and
just
as
they
were
driving
up
to
the
door
a
young
man
slight
and
stooping
got
out
of
a
hansom
and
crossed
the
pavement
jove
said
lavender
is
redburn
i
did
not
know
he
knew
lorraine
and
her
mother
that
is
lord
arthur
redburn
sheila
mind
if
you
should
talk
to
him
not
to
call
him
sheila
laughed
and
said
am
i
to
remember
all
these
things
they
got
into
the
house
and
lavender
found
himself
with
sheila
on
his
arm
entering
a
to
present
her
to
certain
of
his
friends
it
was
a
large
room
with
a
great
deal
of
gilding
and
color
about
it
and
with
a
conservatory
at
the
further
end
but
the
blaze
of
light
had
not
so
bewildering
an
effect
on
eyes
as
the
appearance
of
two
ladies
to
whom
she
was
now
introduced
she
had
heard
much
about
them
she
was
curious
to
see
them
many
a
time
had
she
thought
over
the
strange
story
lavender
had
told
her
of
the
woman
who
heard
that
her
husband
was
dying
in
a
hospital
during
the
war
and
started
off
herself
and
her
daughter
to
find
him
out
how
there
was
in
the
same
hospital
another
dying
man
whom
they
had
known
some
years
before
and
who
had
gone
away
because
the
girl
would
not
listen
to
him
how
this
man
being
very
near
to
death
begged
that
the
girl
would
do
him
the
last
favor
he
would
ask
of
her
of
wearing
his
name
and
inheriting
his
property
and
how
some
few
hours
after
the
strange
and
sad
ceremony
had
been
performed
he
breathed
his
last
happy
in
holding
her
hand
the
father
died
next
day
and
the
two
widows
were
thrown
upon
the
world
almost
without
friends
but
not
without
means
this
man
lorraine
had
been
possessed
of
considerable
wealth
and
the
girl
who
had
suddenly
become
mistress
of
it
found
herself
able
to
employ
all
possible
means
in
assuaging
her
grief
they
began
to
travel
the
two
women
went
from
capital
to
capital
until
at
last
they
came
to
london
and
here
having
gathered
around
them
a
considerable
number
of
friends
they
proposed
to
take
up
their
residence
permanently
lavender
had
often
talked
to
sheila
about
lorraine
about
her
shrewdness
her
sharp
sayings
and
the
odd
contrast
between
this
clever
keen
frank
woman
of
the
world
and
the
woman
one
would
have
expected
to
be
the
heroine
of
a
pathetic
tale
but
were
there
two
lorraines
that
had
been
first
question
to
herself
when
after
having
been
introduced
to
one
lady
under
that
name
she
suddenly
saw
before
her
another
who
was
introduced
to
her
as
kavanagh
the
mother
and
daughter
were
singularly
alike
they
had
the
same
slight
and
graceful
figure
which
made
them
appear
taller
than
they
really
were
the
same
pale
fine
and
rather
handsome
features
the
same
large
clear
gray
eyes
and
apparently
the
same
abundant
mass
of
soft
fair
hair
heavily
plaited
in
the
latest
fashion
they
were
both
dressed
entirely
in
black
except
that
the
daughter
had
a
band
of
blue
round
her
slender
waist
it
was
soon
apparent
too
that
the
manner
of
the
two
women
was
singularly
different
kavanagh
bearing
herself
with
a
certain
sad
reserve
that
almost
approached
melancholy
at
times
while
her
daughter
with
more
life
and
spirit
in
her
face
passed
rapidly
through
all
sorts
of
varying
moods
until
one
could
scarcely
tell
whether
the
affectation
lay
in
a
certain
cynical
audacity
in
her
speech
or
whether
it
lay
in
her
assumption
of
a
certain
coyness
and
archness
or
whether
there
was
any
affectation
at
all
in
the
matter
however
that
might
be
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
the
sincerity
of
those
gray
eyes
of
hers
there
was
something
almost
cruelly
frank
in
the
clear
look
of
them
and
when
her
face
was
not
lit
by
some
passing
smile
the
pale
and
fine
features
seemed
to
borrow
something
of
severity
from
her
unflinching
calm
and
dispassionate
habit
of
regarding
those
around
her
sheila
was
prepared
to
like
lorraine
from
the
first
moment
she
had
caught
sight
of
her
the
honesty
of
the
gray
eyes
attracted
her
and
indeed
the
young
widow
seemed
very
much
interested
in
the
young
wife
and
so
far
as
she
could
in
that
awkward
period
just
before
dinner
strove
to
make
friends
with
her
sheila
was
introduced
to
a
number
of
people
but
none
of
them
pleased
her
as
well
as
lorraine
then
dinner
was
announced
and
sheila
found
that
she
was
being
escorted
across
the
passage
to
the
room
on
the
other
side
by
the
young
man
whom
she
had
seen
get
out
of
the
hansom
this
lord
arthur
redburn
was
the
younger
son
of
a
great
tory
duke
he
represented
in
the
house
a
small
country
borough
which
his
father
practically
owned
he
had
a
fair
amount
of
ability
an
uncommonly
high
opinion
of
himself
and
a
certain
affectation
of
being
bored
by
the
frivolous
ways
and
talk
of
ordinary
society
he
gave
himself
credit
for
being
the
clever
member
of
the
family
and
if
there
was
any
cleverness
going
he
had
it
but
there
were
some
who
said
that
his
reputation
in
the
house
and
elsewhere
as
a
good
speaker
was
mainly
based
on
the
fact
that
he
had
an
abundant
assurance
and
was
not
easily
put
out
unfortunately
the
public
could
come
to
no
decision
on
the
point
for
the
reporters
were
not
kind
to
lord
arthur
and
the
substance
of
his
speeches
was
as
unknown
to
the
world
as
his
manner
of
delivering
them
now
lorraine
had
intended
to
tell
this
young
man
something
about
the
girl
whom
he
was
to
take
in
to
dinner
but
she
herself
had
been
so
occupied
with
sheila
that
the
opportunity
escaped
her
lord
arthur
accordingly
knew
only
that
he
was
beside
a
very
pretty
woman
who
was
a
somebody
the
exact
name
he
had
not
caught
and
that
the
few
words
she
had
spoken
were
pronounced
in
a
curious
way
probably
he
thought
she
was
from
dublin
he
also
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
she
was
too
pretty
to
know
anything
about
the
deceased
sister
bill
in
which
he
was
for
family
reasons
deeply
interested
and
considered
it
more
likely
that
she
would
prefer
to
talk
about
theatres
and
such
things
you
at
covent
garden
last
night
he
said
answered
sheila
i
was
there
two
days
ago
and
it
is
very
pretty
to
see
the
flowers
and
the
fruit
and
then
they
smell
so
sweetly
as
you
walk
yes
it
is
delightful
said
lord
arthur
i
was
speaking
of
the
there
a
theatre
in
there
he
stared
at
her
and
inwardly
hoped
she
was
not
mad
in
among
the
shops
no
but
you
know
covent
garden
theatre
have
never
been
in
any
theatre
not
yet
said
sheila
and
then
it
began
to
dawn
upon
him
that
he
must
be
talking
to
frank
wife
was
there
not
some
rumor
about
the
girl
having
come
from
a
remote
part
of
the
highlands
he
determined
on
a
bold
stroke
have
not
been
long
enough
in
london
to
see
the
theatres
i
suppose
and
then
sheila
taking
it
for
granted
that
he
knew
her
husband
very
well
and
that
he
was
quite
familiar
with
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
began
to
chat
to
him
freely
enough
he
found
that
this
highland
girl
of
whom
he
heard
vaguely
was
not
at
all
shy
he
began
to
feel
interested
by
and
by
he
actually
made
efforts
to
assist
her
frankness
by
becoming
equally
frank
and
by
telling
her
all
he
knew
of
the
things
with
which
they
were
mutually
acquainted
of
course
by
this
time
they
had
got
up
into
the
highlands
the
young
man
had
himself
been
in
the
highlands
frequently
indeed
he
had
never
crossed
to
lewis
but
he
had
seen
the
island
from
the
sutherlandshire
coast
there
were
very
many
deer
in
sutherlandshire
were
there
not
yes
he
had
been
out
a
great
many
times
and
had
had
his
share
of
adventures
had
he
not
gone
out
there
before
daylight
and
waited
on
the
top
of
a
hill
hidden
by
some
rocks
to
watch
the
mist
clear
along
the
hillsides
and
in
the
valley
below
did
he
not
tremble
when
he
fired
his
first
shot
and
had
not
something
passed
before
his
eyes
so
that
he
could
not
see
for
a
moment
whether
the
stag
had
fallen
or
was
away
like
lightning
down
the
bed
of
the
stream
somehow
or
other
lord
arthur
found
himself
relating
all
his
experiences
as
if
he
were
a
novice
begging
for
the
good
opinion
of
a
master
she
knew
all
about
it
obviously
and
he
would
tell
her
his
small
adventures
if
only
that
she
might
laugh
at
him
but
sheila
did
not
laugh
she
was
greatly
delighted
to
have
this
talk
about
the
hills
and
the
deer
and
the
wet
mornings
she
forgot
all
about
the
dinner
before
her
the
servants
whipped
off
successive
plates
without
her
seeing
anything
of
them
they
received
random
answers
about
wine
so
that
she
had
three
full
glasses
standing
by
her
untouched
she
was
no
more
in
holland
park
at
that
moment
than
were
the
wild
animals
of
which
she
spoke
so
proudly
and
lovingly
if
the
great
and
frail
masses
of
flowers
on
the
table
brought
her
any
perfume
at
all
it
was
a
scent
of
lord
arthur
thought
that
his
companion
was
a
little
too
frank
and
confiding
or
rather
that
she
would
have
been
had
she
been
talking
to
any
one
but
himself
he
rather
liked
it
he
was
pleased
to
have
established
friendly
relations
with
a
pretty
woman
in
so
short
a
space
but
ought
not
her
husband
to
give
her
a
hint
about
not
admitting
all
and
sundry
to
the
enjoyment
of
these
favors
perhaps
too
lord
arthur
felt
bound
to
admit
to
himself
there
were
some
men
who
more
than
others
inspired
confidence
in
women
he
laid
no
claims
to
being
a
fascinating
person
but
he
had
had
his
share
of
success
and
considered
that
sheila
showed
discrimination
as
well
as
good
nature
in
talking
so
to
him
there
was
after
all
no
necessity
for
her
husband
to
warn
her
she
would
know
how
to
guard
against
admitting
all
men
to
a
like
intimacy
in
the
meantime
he
was
very
well
pleased
to
be
sitting
beside
this
pretty
and
agreeable
companion
who
had
an
abundant
fund
of
good
spirits
and
who
showed
no
sort
of
conscious
embarrassment
in
thanking
you
with
a
bright
look
of
her
eyes
or
by
a
smile
when
you
told
her
something
that
pleased
or
amused
her
but
these
flattering
little
speculations
were
doomed
to
receive
a
sudden
check
the
juvenile
began
to
remark
that
a
shade
occasionally
crossed
the
face
of
his
fair
companion
and
that
she
sometimes
looked
a
little
anxiously
across
the
table
where
mr
lavender
and
lorraine
were
seated
half
hidden
from
view
by
a
heap
of
silver
and
flowers
in
the
middle
of
the
board
but
though
they
could
not
easily
be
seen
except
at
such
moments
as
they
turned
to
address
some
neighbor
they
could
be
distinctly
enough
heard
when
there
was
any
lull
in
the
general
conversation
and
what
sheila
heard
did
not
please
her
she
began
to
like
that
fair
young
woman
less
perhaps
her
husband
meant
nothing
by
the
fashion
in
which
he
talked
of
marriage
and
the
condition
of
a
married
man
but
she
would
rather
have
not
heard
him
talk
so
moreover
she
was
aware
that
in
the
gentlest
possible
fashion
lorraine
was
making
fun
of
her
companion
and
exposing
him
to
small
and
graceful
shafts
of
ridicule
while
he
seemed
on
the
whole
to
enjoy
these
attacks
the
ingenuous
of
lord
arthur
redburn
was
severely
wounded
by
the
notion
that
after
all
he
had
been
made
a
paw
of
by
a
jealous
wife
he
had
been
flattered
by
this
exceeding
friendliness
he
had
given
her
credit
for
genuine
impulsiveness
which
seemed
to
him
as
pleasing
as
it
was
uncommon
and
he
had
with
the
moderation
expected
of
a
man
in
politics
who
hoped
some
day
to
assist
in
the
government
of
the
nation
by
accepting
a
junior
lordship
admired
her
but
was
it
all
pretence
was
she
paying
court
to
him
merely
to
annoy
her
husband
had
her
enthusiasm
about
the
shooting
of
red
deer
been
prompted
by
a
wish
to
attract
a
certain
pair
of
eyes
at
the
other
side
of
the
table
lord
arthur
began
to
sneer
at
himself
for
having
been
duped
he
ought
to
have
known
women
were
as
much
women
in
a
hebridean
island
as
in
bayswater
he
began
to
treat
sheila
with
a
little
more
coolness
while
she
became
more
and
more
with
the
couple
across
the
table
and
sometimes
was
innocently
rude
in
answering
his
questions
somewhat
at
random
when
the
ladies
were
going
into
the
lorraine
put
her
hand
within
arm
and
led
her
to
the
entrance
to
the
conservatory
hope
we
shall
be
friends
she
said
hope
so
said
sheila
not
very
warmly
you
get
better
acquainted
with
your
friends
you
will
feel
rather
lonely
at
being
left
as
at
present
i
little
said
sheila
is
a
silly
thing
altogether
if
men
smoked
after
dinner
i
could
understand
it
but
they
merely
sit
looking
at
wine
they
drink
talking
a
few
commonplaces
and
do
they
do
it
then
said
sheila
do
it
everywhere
but
here
we
keep
to
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
do
you
know
about
the
manners
of
the
ancients
said
kavanagh
tapping
her
shoulder
as
she
passed
with
a
sheet
of
music
have
studied
them
frequently
mamma
said
the
daughter
with
composure
the
at
the
zoological
the
mamma
smiled
and
passed
on
to
place
the
music
on
the
piano
sheila
did
not
understand
what
her
companion
had
said
and
indeed
lorraine
immediately
turned
with
the
same
calm
fair
face
and
fearless
eyes
to
ask
sheila
whether
she
would
not
by
and
by
sing
one
of
those
northern
songs
of
which
mr
lavender
had
told
her
a
tall
girl
with
her
back
hair
tied
in
a
knot
and
her
costume
copied
from
a
drawing
sat
down
to
the
piano
and
sang
a
mystic
song
of
the
present
day
in
which
the
moon
the
stars
and
other
natural
objects
behaved
strangely
and
were
somehow
mixed
up
with
the
appeal
of
a
maiden
who
demanded
that
her
dead
lover
should
be
reclaimed
from
the
sea
you
ever
go
down
to
your
studio
said
lorraine
she
glanced
toward
the
lady
at
the
piano
you
may
talk
said
lorraine
with
the
least
expression
of
contempt
in
her
gray
eyes
is
singing
to
gratify
herself
not
i
sometimes
go
down
said
sheila
in
as
low
a
voice
as
she
could
manage
without
falling
into
a
whisper
it
is
such
a
dismal
place
it
is
very
hard
on
him
to
have
to
work
in
a
big
bare
room
like
that
with
the
windows
half
blinded
but
sometimes
i
think
frank
would
rather
have
me
out
of
the
what
would
he
do
if
both
of
us
were
to
pay
him
a
visit
said
lorraine
should
so
like
to
see
the
studio
you
call
for
me
some
day
and
take
me
with
you
take
her
with
her
indeed
sheila
began
to
wonder
that
she
did
not
propose
to
go
alone
fortunately
there
was
no
need
to
answer
the
question
for
at
this
moment
the
song
came
to
an
end
and
there
was
a
general
movement
and
murmur
of
gratitude
you
said
lorraine
to
the
lady
who
had
sung
the
song
and
was
now
returning
to
the
photographs
she
had
left
you
very
much
i
knew
some
one
would
instantly
ask
you
to
sing
that
song
it
is
the
most
charming
of
all
your
songs
i
think
and
how
well
it
suits
your
voice
too
then
she
turned
to
sheila
again
did
you
like
lord
arthur
redburn
think
he
is
a
very
good
young
men
are
never
good
but
they
may
be
very
amiable
said
lorraine
not
perceiving
that
sheila
had
blundered
on
a
wrong
adjective
and
that
she
had
really
meant
that
she
thought
him
honest
and
pleasant
did
not
speak
at
all
i
think
to
your
neighbor
on
the
right
that
was
wise
of
you
he
is
a
most
insufferable
person
but
mamma
bears
with
him
for
the
sake
of
his
daughter
who
sang
just
now
he
is
too
rich
and
he
smiles
blandly
and
takes
a
sort
of
view
of
things
as
if
he
coincided
with
the
arrangements
of
providence
you
take
coffee
tea
then
i
have
met
your
aunt
i
mean
aunt
such
a
dear
old
lady
she
like
her
said
sheila
you
really
at
present
but
i
shall
try
to
like
said
lorraine
calmly
know
she
has
her
peculiarities
i
wish
she
talk
so
much
about
marcus
antoninus
and
doses
of
medicine
i
fancy
i
smell
calomel
when
she
comes
near
i
suppose
if
she
were
in
a
pantomime
dress
her
up
as
a
phial
tie
a
string
around
her
neck
and
label
her
dear
me
how
languid
one
gets
in
this
climate
let
us
sit
down
i
wish
i
was
as
strong
as
they
sat
down
together
and
lorraine
evidently
expected
to
be
petted
and
made
much
of
by
her
new
companion
she
gave
herself
pretty
little
airs
and
graces
and
said
no
more
cutting
things
about
anybody
and
sheila
somehow
found
herself
being
drawn
to
the
girl
so
that
she
could
scarcely
help
taking
her
hand
and
saying
how
sorry
she
was
to
see
her
so
pale
and
fine
and
delicate
the
hand
too
was
so
small
that
the
tiny
white
fingers
seemed
scarcely
bigger
than
the
claws
of
a
bird
was
not
that
slender
waist
to
which
some
little
attention
was
called
by
a
belt
of
bold
blue
just
a
little
too
slender
for
health
although
the
bust
and
shoulders
were
exquisitely
and
finely
proportioned
were
at
the
academy
all
the
morning
and
mamma
is
not
a
bit
tired
why
has
not
mr
lavender
anything
at
the
academy
oh
i
forgot
she
added
with
a
smile
course
he
has
been
very
much
engaged
but
now
i
suppose
he
will
settle
down
to
sheila
wished
that
this
girl
would
not
so
continually
refer
to
her
husband
but
how
was
any
one
to
find
fault
with
her
when
she
put
a
little
air
of
plaintiveness
into
the
ordinarily
cold
gray
eyes
and
looked
at
her
small
hand
as
much
as
to
say
fingers
there
are
very
small
and
even
whiter
than
the
glove
that
covers
them
they
are
the
fingers
of
a
child
who
ought
to
be
then
the
men
came
in
from
the
lavender
looked
around
to
see
where
sheila
was
perhaps
with
a
trifle
of
disappointment
that
she
was
not
the
most
prominent
figure
there
had
he
expected
to
find
all
the
women
surrounding
her
and
admiring
her
and
all
the
men
going
up
to
pay
court
to
her
sheila
was
seated
near
a
small
table
and
lorraine
was
showing
her
something
she
was
just
like
anybody
else
if
she
was
a
wonderful
who
had
come
into
a
new
world
no
one
seemed
to
observe
her
the
only
thing
that
distinguished
her
from
the
women
around
her
was
her
freshness
of
color
and
the
unusual
combination
of
black
eyelashes
and
dark
blue
eyes
lavender
had
arranged
that
first
appearance
in
public
should
be
at
a
very
quiet
little
dinner
party
but
even
here
she
failed
to
create
any
profound
impression
she
was
as
he
had
to
confess
to
himself
again
just
like
anybody
else
he
went
over
to
where
lorraine
was
and
sat
down
beside
her
sheila
remembering
his
injunctions
felt
bound
to
leave
him
there
and
as
she
rose
to
speak
to
kavanagh
who
was
standing
by
that
lady
came
and
begged
her
to
sing
a
highland
song
by
this
time
lavender
had
succeeded
in
interesting
his
companion
about
something
or
other
and
neither
of
them
had
noticed
that
sheila
had
gone
to
the
piano
attended
by
the
young
politician
who
had
taken
her
in
to
dinner
nor
did
they
interrupt
their
talk
merely
because
some
one
had
played
a
few
bars
of
prelude
but
what
was
this
that
suddenly
startled
lavender
to
the
heart
causing
him
to
look
up
with
surprise
he
had
not
heard
the
air
since
he
was
in
borva
and
when
sheila
sang
hark
hark
the
horn
on
borne
awake
it
is
morn
awake
monaltrie
all
sorts
of
reminiscences
came
rushing
in
upon
him
how
often
had
he
heard
that
wild
story
of
flight
sung
out
in
the
small
chamber
over
the
sea
with
a
sound
of
the
waves
outside
and
a
scent
of
coming
in
at
the
door
and
the
window
it
was
from
the
shores
of
borva
that
young
monaltrie
must
have
fled
it
must
have
been
in
borva
that
his
sweetheart
sat
in
her
bower
and
sang
the
burden
of
all
her
singing
being
monaltrie
and
then
as
sheila
sang
now
making
the
monotonous
and
plaintive
air
wild
and
strange
what
cries
of
wild
despair
awake
the
sultry
air
frenzied
with
anxious
care
she
seeks
monaltrie
he
heard
no
more
of
the
song
he
was
thinking
of
days
in
borva
and
of
old
mackenzie
living
in
his
lonely
house
there
when
sheila
had
finished
singing
he
looked
at
her
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
still
that
beautiful
princess
whom
he
had
wooed
on
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
and
if
those
people
did
not
see
her
as
he
saw
her
ought
he
to
be
disappointed
because
of
their
blindness
but
if
they
saw
nothing
mystic
or
wonderful
about
sheila
they
at
all
events
were
considerably
surprised
by
the
strange
sort
of
music
she
sang
it
was
not
of
a
sort
commonly
heard
in
a
london
the
pathos
of
its
minor
chords
its
abrupt
intervals
startling
and
wild
in
their
effect
and
the
slowly
subsiding
wail
in
which
it
closed
did
not
much
resemble
the
ordinary
here
at
least
sheila
had
produced
an
impression
and
presently
there
was
a
heap
of
people
around
the
piano
expressing
their
admiration
asking
questions
and
begging
her
to
continue
but
she
rose
she
would
rather
not
sing
just
then
whereupon
lavender
came
to
her
and
said
you
sing
that
wild
one
about
the
farewell
that
has
the
sound
of
the
pipes
in
it
you
know
yes
she
said
directly
lavender
went
back
to
his
companion
is
very
obedient
to
you
said
lorraine
with
a
smile
at
present
he
said
and
he
thought
meanly
of
himself
for
saying
it
the
moment
the
words
were
uttered
oh
soft
be
thy
slumbers
by
tigh
waters
thy
was
sung
by
fair
daughters
but
far
in
lochaber
the
true
heart
was
weeping
whose
hopes
are
entombed
in
the
grave
where
sleeping
so
sheila
sang
and
it
seemed
to
the
people
that
this
ballad
was
even
more
strange
than
its
predecessor
when
the
song
was
over
sheila
seemed
rather
anxious
to
get
out
of
the
crowd
and
indeed
walked
away
into
the
conservatory
to
have
a
look
at
the
flowers
yes
lavender
had
to
confess
to
himself
sheila
was
just
like
anybody
else
in
this
his
had
produced
no
startling
impression
he
forgot
that
he
had
just
been
teaching
her
the
necessity
of
observing
the
ways
and
customs
of
the
people
around
her
so
that
she
might
avoid
singularity
on
one
point
at
least
she
was
resolved
she
would
attend
to
his
counsels
she
would
not
make
him
ridiculous
by
any
show
of
affection
before
the
eyes
of
strangers
she
did
not
go
near
him
the
whole
evening
she
remained
for
the
most
part
in
that
at
the
end
of
the
and
when
any
one
talked
to
her
she
answered
and
when
she
was
left
alone
she
turned
to
the
flowers
all
this
time
however
she
could
observe
that
lavender
and
lorraine
were
very
much
engrossed
in
their
conversation
that
she
seemed
very
much
amused
and
he
at
times
a
trifle
embarrassed
and
that
both
of
them
had
apparently
forgotten
her
existence
kavanagh
was
continually
coming
to
sheila
and
trying
to
coax
her
back
into
the
larger
room
but
in
vain
she
would
rather
not
sing
any
more
that
night
she
liked
to
look
at
the
flowers
she
was
not
tired
at
all
and
she
had
already
seen
those
wonderful
photographs
about
which
everybody
was
talking
sheila
how
did
you
enjoy
yourself
said
her
husband
as
they
were
driving
home
wish
ingram
had
been
there
said
sheila
he
would
not
have
stopped
in
the
place
five
minutes
unless
he
could
play
the
part
of
diogenes
and
say
rude
things
to
everybody
all
around
were
you
at
all
dull
somebody
look
after
you
yes
many
persons
were
very
kind
but
but
seemed
to
be
better
off
than
myself
they
all
seemed
to
be
wanting
something
to
do
and
i
am
sure
they
were
all
very
glad
to
come
no
no
sheila
that
is
only
your
fancy
you
were
not
much
interested
that
is
evident
but
you
will
get
on
better
when
know
more
of
the
people
you
were
a
stranger
that
is
what
disappointed
you
but
you
will
not
always
be
a
sheila
did
not
answer
perhaps
she
contemplated
with
no
great
hope
or
longing
the
possibility
of
her
coming
to
like
such
a
method
of
getting
through
an
evening
at
all
events
she
looked
forward
with
no
great
pleasure
to
the
chance
of
her
having
to
become
friends
with
lorraine
all
the
way
home
sheila
was
examining
her
own
heart
to
try
to
discover
why
such
bitter
feelings
should
be
there
surely
that
girl
was
honest
there
was
honesty
in
her
eyes
she
had
been
most
kind
to
sheila
herself
and
was
there
not
at
times
when
she
abandoned
the
ways
and
speech
of
a
woman
of
the
world
a
singular
coy
fascination
about
her
that
any
man
might
be
excused
for
yielding
to
even
as
any
woman
might
yield
to
it
sheila
fought
with
herself
and
resolved
that
she
would
cast
forth
from
her
heart
those
harsh
fancies
and
indignant
feelings
that
seemed
to
have
established
themselves
there
she
would
hate
lorraine
as
for
lavender
what
was
he
thinking
of
now
that
he
and
his
young
wife
were
driving
home
from
their
first
experiment
in
society
he
had
to
confess
to
a
certain
sense
of
failure
his
dreams
had
not
been
realized
every
one
who
had
spoken
to
him
had
conveyed
to
him
as
freely
as
good
manners
would
admit
their
congratulations
and
their
praises
of
his
wife
but
the
impressive
scenes
he
had
been
forecasting
were
out
of
the
question
there
was
a
little
curiosity
about
her
on
the
part
of
those
who
knew
her
story
and
that
was
all
sheila
bore
herself
very
well
she
made
no
blunders
she
had
a
good
presence
she
sang
well
and
every
one
could
see
that
she
was
handsome
gentle
and
honest
surely
he
argued
with
himself
that
ought
to
content
the
most
exacting
but
in
spite
of
all
argument
he
was
not
content
he
did
not
regret
that
he
had
sacrificed
his
liberty
in
a
freak
of
romance
he
did
not
even
regard
the
fact
of
a
man
in
his
position
having
dared
to
marry
a
penniless
girl
as
anything
very
meritorious
or
heroic
but
he
had
hoped
that
the
dramatic
circumstances
of
the
case
would
be
duly
recognized
by
his
friends
and
that
sheila
would
be
an
object
of
interest
and
wonder
and
talk
in
a
whole
series
of
social
circles
but
the
result
of
his
venture
was
different
there
was
only
one
married
man
the
more
in
london
and
london
was
not
disposed
to
pay
any
particular
heed
to
that
circumstance
chapter
xiii
by
the
waters
of
babylon
if
frank
lavender
had
been
told
that
his
love
for
his
wife
was
in
danger
of
waning
he
would
have
laughed
the
suggestion
to
scorn
he
was
as
fond
of
her
and
as
proud
of
her
as
ever
who
knew
as
well
as
himself
the
tenderness
of
her
heart
the
delicate
sensitiveness
of
her
conscience
the
generosity
of
she
was
always
ready
to
bestow
and
was
he
likely
to
become
blind
so
that
he
should
fail
to
see
how
fair
and
frank
and
handsome
she
was
he
had
been
disappointed
it
is
true
in
his
fancies
about
the
impression
she
would
produce
on
his
friends
but
what
a
trifle
was
that
the
folly
of
those
fancies
was
his
own
for
the
rest
he
was
glad
that
sheila
was
not
so
different
from
the
other
women
whom
he
knew
he
hit
upon
the
profound
reflection
as
he
sat
alone
in
his
studio
that
a
wife
like
his
costume
should
not
be
so
remarkable
as
to
attract
attention
the
perfection
of
dress
was
that
you
should
be
unconscious
of
its
presence
might
that
not
be
so
with
marriage
after
all
it
was
better
he
had
not
bound
himself
to
lug
about
a
lion
whenever
he
visited
houses
still
there
was
something
he
found
himself
a
good
deal
alone
sheila
did
not
seem
to
care
much
for
going
into
society
and
although
he
did
not
much
like
the
notion
of
going
by
himself
nevertheless
one
had
certain
duties
towards
friends
to
perform
she
did
not
even
care
to
go
down
to
the
park
of
a
forenoon
she
always
professed
her
readiness
to
go
but
he
fancied
it
was
a
trifle
tiresome
for
her
and
so
when
there
was
nothing
particular
going
on
in
the
studio
he
would
walk
down
through
kensington
gardens
himself
and
have
a
chat
with
some
friends
followed
generally
by
luncheon
with
this
or
the
other
party
of
them
sheila
had
been
taught
that
she
ought
not
to
come
so
frequently
to
that
studio
bras
would
not
lie
quiet
moreover
if
dealers
or
other
strangers
should
come
in
would
they
not
take
her
for
a
model
so
sheila
stayed
at
home
and
mr
lavender
after
having
dressed
with
care
in
the
morning
with
very
singular
care
indeed
considering
that
he
was
going
to
his
work
used
to
go
down
to
his
studio
to
smoke
a
cigarette
the
chances
were
that
he
was
not
in
the
humor
for
working
he
would
sit
down
in
an
and
kick
his
heels
on
the
floor
for
a
time
watching
perhaps
the
sunlight
come
in
through
the
upper
part
of
the
windows
and
paint
yellow
squares
on
the
opposite
wall
then
he
would
go
out
and
lock
the
door
behind
him
leaving
no
message
whatever
for
those
crowds
of
importunate
dealers
who
as
sheila
fancied
were
besieging
him
with
offers
in
one
hand
and
purses
of
gold
in
the
other
one
morning
after
she
had
been
for
two
or
three
days
and
had
grown
hopelessly
tired
of
the
monotony
of
watching
that
sunlit
square
she
was
filled
with
an
unconquerable
longing
to
go
away
for
however
brief
a
space
from
the
sight
of
houses
the
morning
was
sweet
and
clear
and
bright
white
clouds
were
slowly
crossing
a
fair
blue
sky
and
a
fresh
and
cool
breeze
was
blowing
in
at
the
open
french
windows
she
said
going
down
stairs
and
out
into
the
small
garden
are
going
into
the
the
great
deerhound
seemed
to
know
and
rose
and
came
to
her
with
great
gravity
while
she
clasped
on
the
leash
he
was
no
frisky
animal
to
show
his
delight
by
yelping
and
gamboling
but
he
laid
his
long
nose
in
her
hand
and
slowly
wagged
the
curve
of
his
shaggy
tail
and
then
he
placidly
walked
by
her
side
up
into
the
hall
where
he
stood
awaiting
her
she
would
go
along
and
beg
of
her
husband
to
leave
his
work
for
a
day
and
go
with
her
for
a
walk
down
to
richmond
park
she
had
often
heard
ingram
speak
of
walking
down
and
she
remembered
that
much
of
the
road
was
pretty
why
should
not
her
husband
have
one
holiday
is
such
a
shame
she
had
said
to
him
that
morning
as
he
left
you
will
be
going
into
that
gloomy
place
with
its
bare
walls
and
chairs
and
the
windows
so
that
you
can
not
see
out
of
them
must
get
some
work
done
somehow
sheila
he
said
although
he
did
not
tell
her
that
he
had
not
finished
a
picture
since
his
marriage
wish
i
could
do
some
of
it
for
you
she
said
all
the
work
good
for
is
catching
fish
and
feeding
ducks
and
planting
things
in
gardens
why
you
come
down
and
feed
the
ducks
in
the
serpentine
should
like
to
do
that
she
answered
will
go
any
day
with
he
said
see
i
know
until
i
get
along
to
the
studio
whether
i
can
get
away
for
the
forenoon
and
then
if
i
were
to
come
back
here
you
would
have
little
or
no
time
to
dress
she
said
to
him
giving
up
the
serpentine
without
much
regret
but
the
forenoon
had
turned
out
so
delightful
that
she
thought
she
would
go
along
to
the
studio
and
hale
him
out
of
that
gaunt
and
dingy
apartment
she
should
take
him
away
from
town
therefore
she
might
put
on
that
rough
blue
dress
in
which
she
used
to
go
boating
in
loch
roag
she
had
lately
smartened
it
up
a
bit
with
some
white
braid
and
she
hoped
he
would
approve
did
the
big
hound
know
the
dress
he
rubbed
his
head
against
her
arm
and
hand
when
she
came
down
and
looked
up
and
whined
almost
inaudibly
are
going
out
bras
and
you
must
be
a
good
dog
and
not
try
to
go
after
the
deer
then
i
will
send
a
very
good
story
of
you
to
mairi
and
when
she
comes
to
london
after
the
harvest
is
over
she
will
bring
you
a
present
from
the
lewis
and
you
will
be
very
she
went
out
into
the
square
and
was
perhaps
a
little
glad
to
get
away
from
it
as
she
was
not
sure
of
the
blue
dress
and
the
small
hat
with
its
feather
being
precisely
the
costume
which
she
ought
to
wear
when
she
got
into
the
uxbridge
road
she
breathed
more
freely
and
in
the
lightness
of
her
heart
she
continued
the
conversation
with
bras
giving
that
attentive
animal
a
vast
amount
of
information
partly
in
english
partly
in
gaelic
which
he
answered
only
by
a
low
whine
or
a
shake
of
his
shaggy
head
but
these
confidences
were
suddenly
interrupted
she
had
got
down
to
addison
terrace
and
was
contentedly
looking
at
the
trees
and
chatting
to
the
dog
when
by
accident
her
eyes
happened
to
light
on
a
brougham
that
was
driving
past
in
it
she
beheld
them
both
clearly
for
a
brief
second
were
her
husband
and
lorraine
so
engaged
in
conversation
that
neither
of
them
saw
her
sheila
stood
on
the
pavement
for
a
couple
of
minutes
absolutely
bewildered
all
sorts
of
wild
fancies
and
recollections
came
crowding
in
upon
her
reasons
why
her
husband
was
unwilling
that
she
should
visit
his
studio
why
lorraine
never
called
on
her
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
she
did
not
know
what
to
think
for
a
time
but
presently
all
this
tumult
was
stilled
and
she
had
resolved
her
doubts
and
made
up
her
mind
as
to
what
she
should
do
she
would
not
suspect
her
husband
that
was
the
one
sweet
security
to
which
she
clung
he
had
made
use
of
no
duplicity
if
there
were
duplicity
in
the
case
at
all
he
could
not
be
the
author
of
it
the
reasons
for
his
having
of
late
left
her
so
much
alone
were
the
true
reasons
and
if
this
lorraine
should
amuse
him
and
interest
him
who
ought
to
grudge
him
this
break
in
the
monotony
of
his
work
sheila
knew
that
she
herself
disliked
going
to
those
fashionable
gatherings
to
which
lorraine
went
and
to
which
lavender
had
been
accustomed
to
go
before
he
was
married
how
could
she
expect
him
to
give
up
all
his
old
habits
and
pleasures
for
her
sake
she
would
be
more
generous
it
was
her
own
fault
that
she
was
not
a
better
companion
for
him
then
to
think
hardly
of
him
because
he
went
to
the
park
with
a
friend
instead
of
going
alone
yet
there
was
a
great
bitterness
and
grief
in
her
heart
as
she
turned
and
walked
on
she
spoke
no
more
to
the
deerhound
by
her
side
there
seemed
to
be
less
sunlight
in
the
air
and
the
people
and
carriages
passing
were
hardly
so
busy
and
cheerful
and
interesting
as
they
had
been
but
all
the
same
she
would
go
to
richmond
park
and
by
herself
for
what
was
the
use
in
calling
in
at
the
studio
and
how
could
she
go
back
home
and
sit
in
the
house
knowing
that
her
husband
was
away
at
some
or
morning
concert
or
some
such
thing
with
that
young
american
lady
she
knew
no
other
road
to
richmond
than
that
by
which
they
had
driven
shortly
after
her
arrival
in
london
and
so
it
was
that
she
went
down
and
over
hammersmith
bridge
and
around
by
mortlake
and
so
on
by
east
sheen
the
road
seemed
terribly
long
she
was
an
excellent
walker
and
in
ordinary
circumstances
would
have
done
the
distance
without
fatigue
but
when
at
length
she
saw
the
gates
of
the
park
before
her
she
was
at
once
exceedingly
tired
and
almost
faint
from
hunger
here
was
the
hotel
in
which
they
had
dined
should
she
enter
the
place
seemed
very
grand
and
forbidding
she
had
scarcely
even
looked
at
it
as
she
went
up
the
steps
with
her
husband
by
her
side
however
she
would
venture
and
accordingly
she
went
up
into
the
vestibule
looking
rather
timidly
about
a
young
gentleman
apparently
not
a
waiter
approached
her
and
seemed
to
wait
for
her
to
speak
it
was
a
terrible
moment
what
was
she
to
ask
for
and
could
she
ask
it
of
this
young
man
fortunately
he
spoke
first
and
asked
her
if
she
wished
to
go
into
the
and
if
she
expected
any
one
i
do
not
expect
any
one
she
said
and
she
knew
that
he
would
perceive
the
peculiarity
of
her
accent
if
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
where
i
may
have
a
biscuit
it
occurred
to
her
that
to
go
into
the
star
and
garter
for
a
biscuit
was
absurd
and
she
added
wildly
anything
to
the
young
man
obviously
regarded
her
with
some
surprise
but
was
very
courteous
and
showed
her
into
the
and
called
a
waiter
to
her
moreover
he
gave
permission
for
bras
to
be
admitted
into
the
room
sheila
promising
that
he
would
lie
under
the
table
and
not
budge
an
inch
then
she
looked
around
there
were
only
three
persons
in
the
room
one
an
old
lady
seated
by
herself
in
a
far
corner
the
other
two
being
a
couple
of
young
folks
too
much
engrossed
with
each
other
to
mind
any
one
else
she
began
to
feel
more
at
home
the
waiter
suggested
various
things
for
lunch
and
she
made
her
choice
of
something
cold
then
she
mustered
up
courage
to
ask
for
a
glass
of
sherry
how
she
would
have
enjoyed
all
this
as
a
story
to
tell
to
her
husband
but
for
that
incident
of
the
morning
she
would
have
gloried
in
her
outward
bravery
and
made
him
smile
with
a
description
of
her
inward
terror
she
would
have
written
about
it
to
the
old
man
in
borva
and
bid
him
consider
how
she
had
been
transformed
and
what
strange
scenes
bras
was
now
witnessing
but
all
that
was
over
she
felt
as
if
she
could
no
longer
ask
her
husband
to
be
amused
by
her
childish
experiences
and
as
for
writing
to
her
father
she
dared
not
write
to
him
in
her
present
mood
perhaps
some
happier
time
would
come
sheila
paid
her
bill
she
had
heard
her
husband
and
ingram
talking
about
tipping
waiters
and
knew
that
she
ought
to
give
something
to
the
man
who
had
attended
on
her
but
how
much
he
was
a
very
person
with
whiskers
and
a
severe
expression
of
face
when
he
had
brought
back
the
change
to
her
she
timidly
selected
a
and
offered
it
to
him
there
was
a
little
glance
of
surprise
she
feared
she
had
not
given
him
enough
then
he
said
you
in
a
vague
and
distant
fashion
and
she
knew
that
she
had
not
given
him
enough
but
it
was
too
late
bras
was
summoned
from
under
the
table
and
again
she
went
out
into
the
fresh
air
my
good
dog
she
said
to
him
as
they
together
walked
up
to
the
gates
and
into
the
park
is
a
very
extravagant
country
you
have
to
pay
to
a
servant
for
bringing
you
a
piece
of
cold
pie
and
then
he
looks
as
if
he
were
not
paid
enough
and
duncan
who
will
do
everything
about
the
house
and
will
give
us
all
our
dinners
only
a
pound
a
week
he
will
get
and
scarlett
has
to
be
kept
out
of
that
and
you
like
to
see
poor
old
scarlett
again
bras
whined
as
if
he
understood
every
word
suppose
now
she
is
hanging
out
the
washing
on
the
gooseberry
bushes
and
you
know
the
song
she
always
used
to
sing
then
you
know
that
scarlett
carried
me
about
long
before
you
were
born
for
you
are
a
mere
infant
compared
with
me
and
she
used
to
sing
to
me
bheirte
bhas
so
mho
sheila
bheag
òg
and
that
is
what
she
is
singing
just
now
in
the
garden
and
mairi
she
is
bringing
the
things
out
of
the
washing
house
papa
is
over
in
stornoway
this
morning
arranging
his
accounts
with
the
people
there
and
perhaps
he
is
down
at
the
quay
looking
at
the
clansman
and
wondering
when
she
is
to
bring
me
into
the
harbor
the
castle
is
all
shut
up
you
know
with
cloths
over
all
the
wonderful
things
and
the
curtains
all
down
and
most
of
the
shutters
shut
do
you
think
papa
has
got
my
letter
in
his
pocket
and
does
he
read
it
over
and
over
again
as
i
read
all
his
letters
to
me
over
and
over
again
you
bad
dog
bras
had
forgotten
to
listen
to
his
mistress
in
the
excitement
of
seeing
in
the
distance
a
large
herd
of
deer
under
certain
trees
she
felt
by
the
leash
that
he
was
trembling
in
every
limb
with
expectation
and
straining
hard
on
the
collar
again
and
again
she
admonished
him
in
vain
until
she
had
at
last
to
drag
him
away
down
the
hill
putting
a
small
plantation
between
him
and
the
herd
here
she
found
a
large
umbrageous
chestnut
tree
with
a
wooden
seat
around
its
trunk
and
so
she
sat
down
in
the
green
twilight
of
the
leaves
while
bras
came
and
put
his
head
in
her
lap
out
beyond
the
shadow
of
the
tree
all
the
world
lay
bathed
in
sunlight
and
a
great
silence
brooded
over
the
long
undulations
of
the
park
where
not
a
human
being
was
within
sight
how
strange
it
was
she
fell
to
thinking
that
within
a
short
distance
there
were
millions
of
men
and
women
while
here
she
was
absolutely
alone
did
they
not
care
then
for
the
sunlight
and
the
trees
and
the
sweet
air
were
they
so
wrapped
up
in
those
social
observances
that
seemed
to
her
so
barren
of
interest
have
a
beautiful
country
here
she
said
talking
in
a
rambling
and
wistful
way
to
bras
and
scarcely
noticing
the
eager
light
in
his
eyes
as
if
he
were
trying
to
understand
have
no
rain
and
no
fog
almost
always
blue
skies
and
the
clouds
high
up
and
far
away
and
the
beautiful
trees
they
have
too
you
never
saw
anything
like
that
in
the
lewis
not
even
at
stornoway
and
the
people
are
so
rich
and
beautiful
in
their
dress
and
all
the
day
they
have
only
to
think
how
to
enjoy
themselves
and
what
new
amusements
is
for
the
morrow
but
i
think
they
are
tired
of
having
nothing
to
do
or
perhaps
you
know
they
are
tired
because
they
have
nothing
to
fight
against
no
hard
weather
and
hunger
and
poverty
they
do
not
care
for
each
other
as
they
would
if
they
were
working
on
the
same
farm
and
trying
to
save
up
for
the
winter
or
if
they
were
going
out
to
the
fishing
and
very
glad
to
come
home
again
from
caithness
to
find
all
the
old
people
very
well
and
the
young
ones
ready
for
a
dance
and
a
dram
and
much
joy
and
laughing
and
telling
of
stories
it
is
a
very
great
difference
there
will
be
in
the
people
very
bras
whined
perhaps
he
understood
her
better
now
that
she
had
involuntarily
fallen
into
something
of
her
old
accent
and
habit
of
speech
you
like
bras
to
be
up
in
borva
again
only
for
this
afternoon
all
the
people
would
come
running
out
and
it
is
little
ailasa
she
would
put
her
arms
around
your
neck
and
old
peter
mctavish
he
would
hear
who
it
was
and
come
out
of
his
house
groping
by
the
wall
and
he
would
say
me
iss
it
you
miss
sheila
indeed
and
mirover
it
iss
a
long
time
since
you
hef
left
the
yes
it
is
a
long
time
a
long
time
and
i
will
be
almost
forgotten
what
it
is
like
sometimes
when
i
try
to
think
of
it
here
it
is
always
the
same
the
same
houses
the
same
soft
air
the
same
still
sunlight
the
same
things
to
do
and
places
to
see
no
storms
shaking
the
windows
or
ships
running
into
the
harbor
and
you
can
not
go
down
to
the
shore
to
see
what
has
happened
or
up
the
hill
to
look
how
the
sea
is
raging
but
it
is
one
day
we
will
go
back
to
the
lewis
oh
yes
we
will
go
back
to
the
lewis
she
rose
and
looked
wistfully
around
her
and
then
turned
with
a
sigh
to
make
her
way
to
the
gates
it
was
with
no
especial
sort
of
gladness
that
she
thought
of
returning
home
here
in
the
great
stillness
she
had
been
able
to
dream
of
the
far
island
which
she
knew
and
to
fancy
herself
for
a
few
minutes
there
now
she
was
going
back
to
the
dreary
monotony
of
her
life
in
that
square
and
to
the
doubts
and
anxieties
which
had
been
suggested
to
her
in
the
morning
the
world
she
was
about
to
enter
once
more
seemed
so
much
less
homely
so
much
less
full
of
interest
and
purpose
than
that
other
and
distant
world
she
had
been
wistfully
regarding
for
a
time
the
people
around
her
hid
neither
the
joys
nor
the
sorrows
with
which
she
had
been
taught
to
sympathize
their
cares
seemed
to
her
to
be
exaggeration
of
trifles
she
could
feel
no
pity
for
them
their
satisfaction
was
derived
from
sources
unintelligible
to
her
and
the
social
atmosphere
around
her
seemed
still
and
close
and
suffocating
so
that
she
was
like
to
cry
out
at
times
for
one
breath
of
clear
wind
for
a
shaft
of
lightning
even
to
cut
through
the
sultry
and
drowsy
sameness
of
her
life
she
had
almost
forgotten
the
dog
by
her
side
while
sitting
under
the
chestnut
she
had
carelessly
and
loosely
wound
the
leash
around
his
neck
in
the
semblance
of
a
collar
and
when
she
arose
and
came
away
she
let
the
dog
walk
by
her
side
without
undoing
the
leash
and
taking
proper
charge
of
him
she
was
thinking
of
far
other
things
indeed
when
she
was
startled
by
some
one
calling
to
her
out
miss
or
have
your
dog
shot
she
turned
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
what
sent
a
thrill
of
terror
to
her
heart
bras
had
sneaked
off
from
her
side
had
trotted
lightly
over
the
breckans
and
was
now
in
full
chase
of
a
herd
of
deer
which
were
flying
down
the
slope
on
the
other
side
of
the
plantation
he
rushed
now
at
one
now
at
another
the
very
number
of
chances
presented
to
him
proving
the
safety
of
the
whole
herd
but
as
sheila
with
a
swift
flight
that
would
have
astonished
most
girls
followed
the
wild
chase
and
came
to
the
crest
of
the
slope
she
could
see
that
the
hound
had
at
length
singled
out
a
particular
deer
a
fine
buck
with
handsome
horns
that
was
making
straight
for
the
foot
of
the
valley
the
herd
that
had
been
much
scattered
were
now
drawing
together
again
though
checking
nothing
of
their
speed
but
this
single
buck
had
been
driven
from
his
companions
and
was
doing
his
utmost
to
escape
from
the
fangs
of
the
powerful
animal
behind
him
what
could
she
do
but
run
wildly
and
breathlessly
on
the
dog
was
now
far
beyond
the
reach
of
her
voice
she
had
no
whistle
all
sorts
of
fearful
anticipations
rushed
in
on
her
mind
the
most
prominent
of
all
being
the
anger
of
her
father
if
bras
were
shot
how
could
she
go
back
to
borva
with
such
a
tale
and
how
could
she
live
in
london
without
this
companion
who
had
come
with
her
from
the
far
north
then
what
terrible
things
were
connected
with
the
killing
of
deer
in
a
royal
park
she
remembered
vaguely
what
ingram
and
her
husband
had
been
saying
and
while
these
things
had
been
crowding
in
upon
her
she
felt
her
strength
beginning
to
fail
while
both
the
dog
and
the
deer
had
disappeared
altogether
from
sight
strange
too
that
in
the
midst
of
her
fatigue
and
fright
while
she
still
managed
to
struggle
on
with
a
sharp
pain
at
her
heart
and
a
sort
of
mist
before
her
eyes
she
had
a
vague
consciousness
that
her
husband
would
be
deeply
vexed
not
by
the
conduct
or
the
fate
of
bras
but
by
her
being
the
heroine
of
so
mad
an
adventure
she
knew
that
he
wished
her
to
be
serious
and
subdued
and
proper
like
the
ladies
whom
she
met
while
an
evil
destiny
seemed
to
dog
her
footsteps
and
precipitate
her
into
all
sorts
of
erratic
mishaps
and
however
this
adventure
was
likely
soon
to
have
an
end
she
could
go
no
further
whatever
had
become
of
bras
it
was
in
vain
for
her
to
think
of
pursuing
him
when
she
at
length
reached
a
broad
and
smooth
road
leading
through
the
pasture
she
could
only
stand
still
and
press
her
two
hands
over
her
heart
while
her
head
seemed
giddy
and
she
did
not
see
two
men
who
had
been
standing
on
the
road
close
by
until
they
came
up
and
addressed
her
then
she
started
and
looked
around
finding
before
her
two
men
who
were
apparently
laborers
of
some
sort
one
of
them
having
a
shovel
over
his
shoulder
your
pardon
miss
but
wur
that
your
dawg
she
said
eagerly
you
get
him
did
you
see
him
go
by
do
you
know
where
he
is
and
my
mate
saw
him
go
by
sure
enough
but
as
for
getting
him
why
the
have
shot
him
by
this
no
cried
sheila
almost
in
tears
must
not
shoot
him
it
was
my
fault
i
will
pay
them
for
all
the
harm
he
has
done
you
tell
me
which
way
he
will
go
past
think
miss
said
the
spokesman
quite
respectfully
you
can
go
much
furder
if
you
would
sit
down
and
rest
yourself
and
keep
an
eye
on
this
shovel
me
and
my
mate
will
have
a
hunt
arter
the
sheila
not
only
accepted
the
offer
gratefully
but
promised
to
give
them
all
the
money
she
had
if
only
they
would
bring
back
the
dog
unharmed
she
made
this
offer
in
consequence
of
some
talk
between
her
husband
and
her
father
which
she
had
overheard
lavender
was
speaking
of
the
civility
he
had
frequently
experienced
at
the
hands
of
scotch
shepherds
and
of
the
independence
with
which
they
refused
to
accept
any
compensation
even
for
services
which
cost
them
a
good
deal
of
time
and
trouble
perhaps
it
was
to
please
father
but
at
any
rate
the
picture
the
young
man
drew
of
the
venality
and
the
cupidity
of
the
folks
in
the
south
was
a
desperately
dark
one
ask
the
name
of
a
village
have
your
stick
picked
up
for
you
from
the
pavement
get
into
a
cab
or
get
out
of
it
and
directly
there
was
a
touch
of
the
cap
and
an
unspoken
request
for
coppers
then
as
the
services
rendered
rose
in
importance
so
did
the
fees
to
waiters
to
coachmen
to
gamekeepers
these
things
and
many
more
sank
into
heart
she
heard
and
believed
and
came
down
to
the
south
with
the
notion
that
every
man
and
woman
who
did
you
the
least
service
expected
to
be
paid
handsomely
for
it
what
therefore
could
she
give
those
two
men
if
they
brought
back
her
deerhound
but
all
the
money
she
had
it
was
a
hard
thing
to
wait
here
in
the
greatest
doubt
and
uncertainty
while
the
afternoon
was
visibly
waning
she
began
to
grow
afraid
perhaps
the
men
had
stolen
the
dog
and
left
her
with
this
shovel
as
a
blind
her
husband
must
have
come
home
and
would
be
astonished
and
perplexed
by
her
absence
surely
he
would
have
the
sense
to
dine
by
himself
instead
of
waiting
for
her
and
she
reflected
with
some
glimpse
of
satisfaction
that
she
had
left
everything
connected
with
dinner
properly
arranged
so
that
he
should
have
nothing
to
grumble
at
she
said
to
herself
as
she
sat
there
watching
the
light
on
the
grass
and
the
trees
getting
more
and
more
yellow
i
am
very
wicked
or
very
wretched
to
think
of
his
grumbling
in
any
case
if
he
grumbles
it
is
because
i
will
attend
too
much
to
the
affairs
of
the
house
and
not
amuse
myself
enough
he
is
very
good
to
me
and
i
have
no
right
to
think
of
his
grumbling
and
i
wish
i
cared
to
amuse
myself
more
to
be
more
of
a
companion
to
him
but
it
is
so
difficult
among
all
those
the
revery
was
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
grass
behind
and
she
turned
quickly
to
find
the
two
men
approaching
her
one
of
them
leading
the
captive
bras
by
the
leash
sheila
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
great
gladness
she
did
not
care
even
to
accuse
the
culprit
whose
consciousness
of
guilt
was
evident
in
his
look
and
in
the
droop
of
his
tail
bras
did
not
once
turn
his
eyes
to
his
mistress
he
hung
down
his
head
while
he
panted
rapidly
and
she
fancied
she
saw
some
smearing
of
blood
on
his
tongue
and
on
the
side
of
his
jaw
her
fears
on
this
head
were
speedily
confirmed
think
miss
as
better
take
him
out
the
park
as
soon
as
may
be
for
got
a
deer
killed
close
by
the
robin
hood
gate
in
the
trees
there
and
if
the
keepers
happen
on
it
afore
you
leave
the
park
get
into
thank
you
said
sheila
retaining
her
composure
bravely
but
with
a
terrible
sinking
of
the
heart
how
can
i
get
to
the
nearest
railway
station
going
to
london
miss
i
suppose
the
nearest
is
richmond
but
it
would
be
quieter
for
you
you
see
miss
if
you
was
to
go
along
to
the
roehampton
gate
and
go
to
you
show
me
the
gate
said
sheila
choosing
the
quieter
route
at
once
but
the
men
themselves
did
not
at
all
like
the
look
of
accompanying
her
and
this
dog
through
the
park
had
they
not
already
condoned
a
felony
or
done
something
equally
dreadful
in
handing
to
her
a
dog
that
had
been
found
keeping
watch
and
ward
over
a
slain
buck
they
showed
her
the
road
to
the
roehampton
gate
and
then
they
paused
before
continuing
on
their
journey
the
pause
meant
money
sheila
took
out
her
purse
there
were
three
sovereigns
and
some
silver
in
it
and
the
entire
sum
in
fulfillment
of
her
promise
she
held
out
to
him
who
had
so
far
conducted
the
negotiations
both
men
looked
frightened
it
was
quite
clear
that
either
good
feeling
or
some
indefinite
fear
of
being
implicated
in
the
killing
of
the
deer
caused
them
to
regard
this
big
bribe
as
something
they
could
not
meddle
with
and
at
length
after
a
pause
of
a
second
or
two
the
spokesman
said
with
great
hesitation
miss
you
kept
your
word
but
me
and
my
mate
well
if
so
be
as
the
same
to
you
rather
have
summut
to
drink
your
you
think
it
is
too
much
the
man
looked
at
his
neighbor
who
nodded
was
only
for
of
a
dawg
miss
you
see
he
remarked
slowly
as
if
to
impress
upon
her
that
they
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
deer
you
take
this
then
and
she
offered
them
half
a
crown
each
their
faces
lightened
considerably
they
took
the
money
and
with
a
formal
expression
of
thanks
moved
off
but
not
before
they
had
taken
a
glance
around
to
see
that
no
one
had
been
a
witness
of
this
interview
and
so
sheila
had
to
walk
away
by
herself
knowing
that
she
had
been
guilty
of
a
dreadful
offence
and
that
at
any
moment
she
might
be
arrested
by
the
officers
of
the
law
what
would
the
old
king
of
borva
say
if
he
saw
his
only
daughter
in
the
hands
of
two
policemen
and
would
not
all
fastidious
and
talkative
and
wondering
friends
pass
about
the
newspaper
report
of
her
trial
and
conviction
a
man
was
approaching
her
as
he
drew
near
her
heart
failed
her
for
might
not
this
be
the
mysterious
george
ranger
himself
about
whom
her
husband
and
ingram
had
been
talking
should
she
drop
on
her
knees
at
once
and
confess
her
sins
and
beg
him
to
let
her
off
if
duncan
were
with
her
or
mairi
or
even
old
scarlett
macdonald
she
would
not
have
cared
so
much
but
it
seemed
so
terrible
to
meet
this
man
alone
however
as
he
drew
near
he
did
not
seem
a
fierce
person
he
was
an
old
gentleman
with
voluminous
white
hair
who
was
dressed
all
in
black
and
carried
an
umbrella
on
this
warm
and
bright
afternoon
he
regarded
her
and
the
dog
in
a
distant
and
contemplative
fashion
as
though
he
would
probably
try
to
remember
some
time
after
that
he
had
really
seen
them
and
then
he
passed
on
sheila
began
to
breathe
more
freely
moreover
here
was
the
gate
and
once
she
was
in
the
high
road
who
could
say
anything
to
her
tired
as
she
was
she
still
walked
rapidly
on
and
in
due
time
having
had
to
ask
the
way
once
or
twice
she
found
herself
at
barnes
station
the
train
came
in
bras
was
committed
to
the
care
of
the
guard
and
she
found
herself
alone
in
a
railway
carriage
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
her
husband
had
told
her
that
whenever
she
felt
uncertain
of
her
whereabouts
if
in
the
country
she
was
to
ask
for
the
nearest
station
and
get
a
train
to
london
if
in
town
she
was
to
get
into
a
cab
and
give
the
driver
her
address
and
indeed
sheila
had
been
so
much
agitated
and
perplexed
during
this
afternoon
that
she
acted
in
a
sort
of
mechanical
fashion
and
really
escaped
the
nervousness
which
otherwise
would
have
attended
the
novel
experience
of
purchasing
a
ticket
and
arranging
about
the
carriage
of
a
dog
in
the
even
now
when
she
found
herself
traveling
alone
and
shortly
to
arrive
at
a
part
of
london
she
had
never
seen
her
crowding
thoughts
and
fancies
were
not
about
her
own
situation
but
about
the
reception
she
would
receive
from
her
husband
would
he
be
vexed
with
her
or
pity
her
had
he
called
with
lorraine
to
take
her
somewhere
and
found
her
gone
had
he
brought
home
some
bachelor
friends
to
dinner
and
been
chagrined
to
find
her
not
in
the
house
it
was
getting
dusk
when
the
slow
approached
home
the
hour
for
dinner
had
long
gone
by
perhaps
her
husband
had
gone
away
somewhere
looking
for
her
and
she
would
find
the
house
empty
but
frank
lavender
came
to
meet
his
wife
in
the
hall
and
said
have
you
been
she
could
not
tell
whether
there
was
anger
or
kindness
in
his
voice
and
she
could
not
well
see
his
face
she
took
his
hand
and
went
into
the
which
was
also
dusk
and
standing
there
told
him
all
her
story
is
too
bad
sheila
he
said
in
atone
of
deep
vexation
jove
go
and
thrash
the
dog
within
an
inch
of
his
she
said
drawing
herself
up
and
for
one
brief
second
could
he
have
but
seen
her
face
there
was
a
touch
of
old
pride
and
firmness
about
the
ordinarily
gentle
lips
it
was
but
for
a
second
she
cast
down
her
eyes
and
said
meekly
hope
you
do
that
frank
the
dog
is
not
to
blame
it
was
my
really
sheila
he
said
are
very
thoughtless
i
wish
you
would
take
some
little
trouble
to
act
as
other
women
act
instead
of
constantly
putting
yourself
and
me
in
the
most
awkward
positions
suppose
i
had
brought
any
one
home
to
dinner
now
and
what
am
i
to
say
to
ingram
for
of
course
i
went
direct
to
his
lodgings
when
i
discovered
that
you
were
nowhere
to
be
found
i
fancied
some
mad
freak
had
taken
you
there
and
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
indeed
i
think
i
should
be
surprised
at
anything
you
do
do
you
know
who
was
in
the
hall
when
i
came
in
this
afternoon
said
sheila
that
wretched
old
hag
who
keeps
the
and
it
seems
you
gave
her
and
all
her
family
tea
and
cake
in
the
kitchen
last
is
a
poor
woman
said
sheila
humbly
poor
old
woman
he
said
impatiently
have
no
doubt
she
is
a
lying
old
thief
who
would
take
an
umbrella
or
a
coat
if
only
she
could
get
the
chance
it
is
really
too
bad
sheila
you
having
all
those
persons
about
you
and
demeaning
yourself
by
attending
on
them
what
must
the
servants
think
of
you
do
not
heed
what
any
servants
think
of
me
she
said
she
was
now
standing
erect
with
her
face
quite
calm
not
he
said
you
would
not
go
and
make
yourself
ridiculous
before
sheila
hesitated
for
a
moment
as
if
she
did
not
understand
and
then
she
said
as
calmly
as
before
but
with
a
touch
of
indignation
about
the
proud
and
beautiful
lips
if
i
make
myself
ridiculous
by
attending
to
poor
people
it
is
not
my
husband
who
should
tell
me
she
turned
and
walked
out
and
he
was
too
surprised
to
follow
her
she
went
up
stairs
to
her
own
room
locked
herself
in
and
threw
herself
on
the
bed
and
then
all
the
bitterness
of
her
heart
rose
up
as
if
in
a
flood
not
against
him
but
against
the
country
in
which
he
lived
and
the
society
which
had
contaminated
him
and
the
ways
and
habits
which
seemed
to
create
a
barrier
between
herself
and
him
so
that
she
was
a
stranger
to
him
and
incapable
of
becoming
anything
else
it
was
a
crime
that
she
should
interest
herself
in
the
unfortunate
creatures
round
about
her
that
she
should
talk
to
them
as
if
they
were
not
human
beings
like
herself
and
have
a
great
sympathy
with
their
small
hopes
and
aims
but
she
would
not
have
been
led
into
such
a
crime
if
she
had
cultivated
from
her
infancy
upward
a
consistent
making
herself
the
centre
of
a
world
of
mean
desires
and
petty
gratifications
and
then
she
thought
of
the
old
and
beautiful
days
up
in
the
lewis
where
the
young
english
stranger
seemed
to
approve
of
her
simple
ways
and
her
charitable
work
and
where
she
was
taught
to
believe
that
in
order
to
please
him
she
had
only
to
continue
to
be
what
she
was
then
there
was
no
great
gulf
of
time
between
that
period
and
this
but
what
had
not
happened
in
the
interval
she
had
not
changed
at
least
she
hoped
she
had
not
changed
she
loved
her
husband
with
her
whole
heart
and
soul
her
devotion
was
as
true
and
constant
as
she
herself
could
have
wished
it
to
be
when
she
dreamed
of
the
duties
of
a
wife
in
the
days
of
her
maidenhood
but
all
around
her
was
changed
she
had
no
longer
the
old
freedom
the
old
delight
in
living
from
day
to
day
the
active
work
and
the
enjoyment
of
seeing
where
she
could
help
and
how
she
could
help
the
people
around
her
when
as
if
by
the
same
sort
of
instinct
that
makes
a
wild
animal
retain
in
captivity
the
habits
which
were
necessary
to
its
existence
when
it
lived
in
freedom
she
began
to
find
out
the
circumstances
of
such
unfortunate
people
as
were
in
her
neighborhood
some
little
solace
was
given
to
her
but
these
people
were
not
friends
to
her
as
the
poor
folk
of
borvapost
had
been
she
knew
too
that
her
husband
would
be
displeased
if
he
found
her
talking
with
a
washerwoman
over
her
family
matters
or
even
advising
one
of
her
own
servants
about
the
disposal
of
her
wages
so
that
while
she
concealed
nothing
from
him
these
things
nevertheless
had
to
be
done
exclusively
in
his
absence
and
was
she
in
so
doing
really
making
herself
ridiculous
did
he
consider
her
ridiculous
or
was
it
not
merely
the
false
and
enervating
influences
of
the
indolent
society
in
which
he
lived
that
had
poisoned
his
mind
and
drawn
him
away
from
her
as
though
into
another
world
alas
if
he
were
in
this
other
world
was
not
she
quite
alone
what
companionship
was
there
possible
between
her
and
the
people
in
this
new
and
strange
land
into
which
she
had
ventured
as
she
lay
on
the
bed
with
her
head
hidden
down
in
the
darkness
the
pathetic
wail
of
the
captive
jews
seemed
to
come
and
go
through
the
bitterness
of
her
thoughts
like
some
mournful
refrain
the
rivers
of
babylon
there
we
sat
down
yea
we
wept
when
we
remembered
she
almost
heard
the
words
and
the
reply
that
rose
up
in
her
heart
was
a
great
yearning
to
go
back
to
her
own
land
so
that
her
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
in
thinking
of
it
and
she
lay
and
sobbed
there
in
the
dusk
would
not
the
old
man
living
all
by
himself
in
that
lonely
island
be
glad
to
see
his
little
girl
back
again
in
the
old
house
and
she
would
sing
to
him
as
she
used
to
sing
not
as
she
had
been
singing
to
those
people
whom
her
husband
knew
there
they
that
carried
us
away
captive
required
of
us
a
song
and
they
that
wasted
us
required
of
us
mirth
saying
sing
us
one
of
the
songs
of
and
she
had
sung
in
the
strange
land
among
the
strange
people
with
her
heart
breaking
with
thoughts
of
the
sea
and
the
hills
and
the
rude
and
sweet
and
simple
ways
of
the
old
life
she
had
left
behind
her
she
thought
it
was
her
father
calling
to
her
and
she
rose
with
a
cry
of
joy
for
one
wild
moment
she
fancied
that
outside
were
all
the
people
she
knew
duncan
and
scarlett
and
mairi
and
that
she
was
once
more
at
home
with
the
sea
all
around
her
and
the
salt
cold
air
i
want
to
speak
to
it
was
her
husband
she
went
to
the
door
opened
it
and
stood
there
penitent
and
with
downcast
face
you
must
not
be
silly
he
said
with
some
kindness
in
his
voice
have
had
no
dinner
you
must
be
do
not
care
for
any
there
is
no
use
troubling
the
servants
when
i
would
rather
lie
down
she
said
servants
you
surely
take
so
seriously
what
i
said
about
them
sheila
of
course
you
need
to
care
what
the
servants
think
and
in
any
case
they
have
to
bring
up
dinner
for
me
so
you
may
as
well
come
and
you
not
had
dinner
she
said
timidly
you
think
i
could
sit
down
and
eat
with
the
notion
that
you
might
have
tumbled
into
the
thames
or
been
kidnapped
or
something
am
very
sorry
she
said
in
a
low
voice
and
in
the
gloom
he
felt
his
hand
taken
and
carried
to
her
lips
then
they
went
down
stairs
in
the
which
was
now
lit
up
by
a
blaze
of
gas
and
candles
during
dinner
of
course
no
very
confidential
talking
was
possible
and
indeed
sheila
had
plenty
to
tell
of
her
adventures
at
richmond
lavender
was
now
in
a
more
amiable
mood
and
was
disposed
to
look
on
the
killing
of
the
roebuck
as
rather
a
good
joke
he
complimented
sheila
on
her
good
sense
in
having
gone
in
at
the
star
and
garter
for
lunch
and
altogether
better
relations
were
established
between
them
but
when
dinner
was
finally
over
and
the
servants
dismissed
lavender
placed
for
her
as
usual
drew
his
own
near
hers
and
lit
a
cigarette
tell
me
sheila
he
said
you
really
vexed
with
me
when
you
went
up
stairs
and
locked
yourself
in
your
room
did
you
think
i
meant
to
displease
you
or
say
anything
harsh
to
you
not
any
of
those
things
she
said
calmly
wished
to
be
alone
to
think
over
what
had
happened
and
i
was
grieved
by
what
you
said
for
i
think
you
can
not
help
looking
at
many
things
not
as
i
will
look
at
them
that
is
all
it
is
my
bringing
up
in
the
highlands
you
know
sheila
it
sometimes
occurs
to
me
that
you
are
not
quite
comfortable
here
and
i
make
out
what
is
the
matter
i
think
you
have
a
perverse
fancy
that
you
are
different
from
the
people
you
meet
and
that
you
can
not
be
like
them
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
now
dear
that
is
only
a
fancy
there
need
be
no
difference
if
you
only
will
take
a
little
frank
she
said
going
over
and
putting
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
can
not
take
that
trouble
i
can
not
try
to
be
like
those
people
and
i
see
a
great
difference
in
you
since
you
have
come
back
to
london
and
you
are
getting
to
be
like
them
and
say
the
things
they
say
if
i
could
only
see
you
my
own
darling
up
in
the
lewis
again
with
rough
clothes
on
and
a
gun
in
your
hand
i
should
be
happy
you
were
yourself
up
there
when
you
were
helping
us
in
the
boat
or
when
you
were
bringing
home
the
salmon
or
when
we
were
all
together
at
night
in
the
little
parlor
you
know
dear
get
excited
now
sit
down
and
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
you
seem
to
have
the
notion
that
people
lose
all
their
finer
sentiments
simply
because
they
in
society
burst
into
raptures
over
them
you
imagine
all
those
people
are
selfish
and
callous
merely
because
they
preserve
a
decent
reticence
to
tell
you
the
truth
that
constant
profession
of
noble
feelings
you
would
like
to
see
would
have
something
of
ostentation
about
sheila
only
sighed
do
not
wish
them
to
be
altered
she
said
by
and
by
with
her
eyes
growing
pensive
i
know
is
that
i
could
not
live
the
same
life
and
you
you
seemed
to
be
happier
up
in
the
highlands
than
you
have
ever
been
you
see
a
man
ought
to
be
happy
when
he
is
enjoying
a
holiday
in
the
country
along
with
the
girl
he
is
engaged
to
but
if
i
had
lived
all
my
life
killing
salmon
and
shooting
wild
duck
i
should
have
grown
up
an
ignorant
boor
with
no
more
sense
of
he
stopped
for
he
saw
that
the
girl
was
thinking
of
her
father
look
here
sheila
you
see
how
you
are
placed
how
we
are
placed
rather
it
be
more
sensible
to
get
to
understand
those
people
you
look
askance
at
and
establish
better
relations
with
them
since
you
have
got
to
live
among
them
i
help
thinking
you
are
too
much
alone
and
you
expect
me
to
stay
in
the
house
always
with
you
a
husband
and
wife
can
not
be
continually
in
each
company
unless
they
want
to
grow
heartily
tired
of
each
other
now
if
you
would
only
lay
aside
those
suspicions
of
yours
you
would
find
the
people
just
as
honest
and
generous
and
friendly
as
any
other
sort
of
people
you
ever
met
although
they
happen
to
be
fond
of
expressing
their
goodness
in
their
have
tried
dear
i
will
try
again
said
sheila
she
resolved
that
she
would
go
down
and
visit
mrs
lavender
next
day
and
try
to
be
interested
in
the
talk
of
such
people
as
might
be
there
she
would
bring
away
some
story
about
this
or
the
other
fashionable
woman
or
noble
lord
just
to
show
her
husband
that
she
was
doing
her
best
to
learn
she
would
drive
patiently
around
the
park
in
that
close
little
brougham
and
listen
attentively
to
the
moralities
of
marcus
aurelius
she
would
make
an
appointment
to
go
with
mrs
lavender
to
a
morning
concert
and
she
would
endeavor
to
muster
up
courage
to
ask
any
ladies
who
might
be
there
to
lunch
with
her
on
that
day
and
go
afterward
to
this
same
entertainment
all
these
things
and
many
more
sheila
silently
vowed
to
herself
she
would
do
while
her
husband
sat
and
expounded
to
her
his
theories
of
the
obligations
which
society
demanded
of
its
members
but
her
plans
were
suddenly
broken
asunder
met
lorraine
accidentally
he
said
it
was
his
first
mention
of
the
young
american
lady
sheila
sat
in
mute
expectation
always
asks
very
kindly
after
is
very
he
did
not
say
however
that
lorraine
had
more
than
once
made
distinct
propositions
when
in
his
company
that
they
should
call
in
for
sheila
and
take
her
out
for
a
drive
or
to
a
flower
show
or
some
such
place
while
lavender
had
always
some
excuse
ready
is
going
to
brighton
and
she
was
wondering
whether
you
would
care
to
run
down
for
a
day
or
her
said
sheila
recoiling
from
such
a
proposal
instinctively
course
not
i
should
go
and
then
at
last
you
know
you
would
see
the
sea
about
which
you
have
been
dreaming
for
ever
so
the
sea
there
was
a
magic
in
the
very
word
that
could
almost
at
any
moment
summon
tears
to
her
eyes
of
course
she
accepted
right
gladly
if
her
duties
were
so
pressing
that
the
journey
to
lewis
and
borva
had
to
be
repeatedly
and
indefinitely
postponed
here
at
least
would
be
a
chance
of
looking
again
at
the
sea
of
drinking
in
the
freshness
and
light
and
color
of
it
of
renewing
her
old
and
intimate
friendship
with
it
that
had
been
broken
off
for
so
long
by
her
stay
in
this
city
of
perpetual
houses
and
still
sunshine
can
tell
her
you
will
go
when
you
see
her
at
lady
by
the
way
it
time
for
you
to
begin
to
dress
lady
repeated
sheila
mechanically
who
had
quite
forgotten
about
her
engagement
for
that
evening
you
are
too
tired
to
go
said
her
husband
she
was
a
little
tired
in
truth
but
surely
just
after
her
promises
spoken
and
unspoken
some
little
effort
was
demanded
of
her
so
she
bravely
went
to
dress
and
in
about
of
an
hour
was
ready
to
drive
down
to
curzon
street
her
husband
had
never
seen
her
look
so
pleased
before
in
going
out
to
any
party
he
flattered
himself
that
his
lecture
had
done
her
some
good
there
was
fair
common
sense
in
what
he
had
said
and
although
doubtless
a
romanticism
was
a
pretty
thing
it
would
have
to
yield
to
the
actual
requirements
of
society
in
time
he
should
educate
sheila
but
he
did
not
know
what
brightened
the
face
all
that
night
and
put
a
new
life
into
the
beautiful
eyes
so
that
even
those
who
knew
her
best
were
struck
by
her
singular
beauty
it
was
the
sea
that
was
coloring
eyes
the
people
around
her
the
glare
of
the
candles
the
hum
of
talking
and
the
motion
of
certain
groups
dancing
over
there
in
the
middle
of
the
throng
all
were
faint
and
visionary
for
she
was
busily
wondering
what
the
sea
would
be
like
the
next
morning
and
what
strange
fancies
would
strike
her
when
once
more
she
walked
on
sand
and
heard
the
roar
of
waves
that
indeed
was
the
sound
that
was
present
in
her
ears
while
the
music
played
and
the
people
murmured
around
her
lorraine
talked
to
her
and
was
surprised
and
amused
to
notice
the
eager
fashion
in
which
the
girl
spoke
of
their
journey
of
the
next
day
the
gentleman
who
took
her
in
to
supper
found
himself
catechised
about
brighton
in
a
manner
which
afforded
him
more
occupation
than
enjoyment
and
when
sheila
drove
away
from
the
house
at
two
in
the
morning
she
declared
to
her
husband
that
she
had
enjoyed
herself
extremely
and
he
was
glad
to
hear
it
and
she
was
particularly
kind
to
himself
in
getting
him
his
slippers
and
fetching
him
that
final
cigarette
which
he
always
had
on
reaching
home
and
then
she
went
off
to
bed
to
dream
of
ships
and
flying
clouds
and
cold
winds
and
a
great
and
beautiful
blue
plain
of
waves
part

xiv
deeper
and
deeper
next
morning
sheila
was
busy
with
her
preparations
for
departure
when
she
heard
a
hansom
drive
up
she
looked
out
and
saw
ingram
step
out
and
before
he
had
time
to
cross
the
pavement
she
had
run
around
and
opened
the
door
and
stood
at
the
top
of
the
steps
to
receive
him
how
often
had
her
husband
cautioned
her
not
to
forget
herself
in
this
monstrous
fashion
you
think
i
had
run
away
have
you
come
to
see
me
she
said
with
a
bright
roseate
gladness
on
her
face
which
reminded
him
of
many
a
pleasant
morning
in
borva
did
not
think
you
had
run
away
for
you
see
i
have
brought
you
some
flowers
but
there
was
a
sort
of
blush
in
the
sallow
face
and
perhaps
the
girl
had
some
quick
fancy
or
suspicion
that
he
had
brought
this
bouquet
to
prove
that
he
knew
everything
was
right
and
that
he
expected
to
see
her
it
was
only
a
part
of
his
universal
kindness
and
thoughtfulness
she
considered
is
up
stairs
she
said
ready
some
things
to
go
to
brighton
will
you
come
into
the
have
you
had
breakfast
you
were
going
to
brighton
she
said
and
somehow
something
moved
her
to
add
quickly
not
for
long
you
know
only
a
few
days
it
is
many
a
time
you
will
have
told
me
of
brighton
long
ago
in
the
lewis
but
i
can
not
understand
a
large
town
being
beside
the
sea
and
it
will
be
a
great
surprise
to
me
i
am
sure
of
sheila
he
said
falling
into
the
old
habit
quite
naturally
will
find
it
different
from
borvapost
you
will
have
no
scampering
about
the
rock
with
your
head
bare
and
your
hair
flying
about
you
will
have
to
dress
more
correctly
there
than
here
even
and
by
the
way
you
must
be
busy
getting
ready
so
i
will
no
she
said
with
a
quick
look
of
disappointment
will
not
go
yet
if
i
had
known
you
were
coming
but
it
was
very
late
when
we
got
home
this
morning
two
it
ball
said
the
girl
but
not
very
joyfully
sheila
he
said
with
a
grave
smile
on
his
face
are
becoming
quite
a
woman
of
fashion
now
and
you
know
i
keep
up
an
acquaintance
with
a
fine
lady
who
goes
to
all
these
grand
places
and
knows
all
sorts
of
swell
people
so
have
to
cut
me
hope
i
shall
be
dead
before
that
time
ever
comes
said
the
girl
with
a
sudden
flash
of
indignation
in
her
eyes
then
she
softened
it
is
not
kind
for
you
to
laugh
at
course
i
did
not
laugh
at
you
he
said
taking
both
her
hands
in
his
i
used
to
sometimes
when
you
were
a
little
girl
and
talked
very
wild
english
you
remember
how
vexed
you
used
to
be
and
how
pleased
you
were
when
your
papa
turned
the
laugh
against
me
by
getting
me
to
say
that
awful
gaelic
sentence
about
young
calf
ate
a
raw
egg
you
say
it
now
said
sheila
with
her
face
getting
bright
and
pleased
again
it
after
me
now
she
uttered
some
half
dozen
of
the
most
extraordinary
sounds
that
any
language
ever
contained
but
ingram
would
not
attempt
to
follow
her
she
reproached
him
with
having
forgotten
all
that
he
had
learnt
in
lewis
and
said
she
should
no
longer
look
on
him
as
a
possible
highlander
what
are
now
he
asked
are
no
longer
that
wild
girl
who
used
to
run
out
to
sea
in
the
whenever
there
was
the
excitement
of
a
storm
coming
times
she
said
slowly
and
wistfully
will
wish
that
i
could
be
that
again
for
a
little
you
enjoy
then
all
those
fine
gatherings
you
go
to
try
to
like
you
succeed
he
was
looking
at
her
gravely
and
earnestly
and
she
turned
away
her
head
and
did
not
answer
at
this
moment
lavender
came
down
stairs
and
entered
the
room
ingram
my
boy
glad
to
see
you
what
pretty
flowers
a
pity
we
take
them
to
brighton
with
i
intend
to
take
them
said
sheila
firmly
very
well
if
you
mind
the
bother
said
her
husband
should
have
thought
your
hands
would
have
been
full
you
know
have
to
take
everything
with
you
you
would
want
in
london
you
will
find
that
brighton
a
dirty
little
in
which
only
to
tuck
up
your
dress
and
run
about
never
saw
a
dirty
little
said
sheila
quietly
her
husband
laughed
meant
no
offense
i
was
not
thinking
of
borvapost
at
all
well
ingram
you
run
down
and
see
us
while
we
are
at
brighton
do
ingram
said
sheila
with
quite
a
new
interest
in
her
face
and
she
came
forward
as
though
she
would
have
gone
down
on
her
knees
and
begged
this
great
favor
of
him
ingram
we
should
try
to
amuse
you
some
way
and
the
weather
is
sure
to
be
fine
shall
we
keep
a
room
for
you
can
you
come
on
friday
and
stay
till
monday
it
is
a
great
difference
there
will
be
in
the
place
if
you
come
ingram
looked
at
sheila
and
was
on
the
point
of
promising
when
lavender
added
we
shall
introduce
you
to
that
young
american
lady
whom
you
are
so
anxious
to
is
she
to
be
there
he
said
looking
rather
curiously
at
lavender
and
her
mother
we
are
going
down
see
whether
i
can
in
a
day
or
two
he
said
but
in
a
tone
which
pretty
nearly
convinced
sheila
that
she
should
not
have
her
stay
at
brighton
made
pleasant
by
the
company
of
her
old
friend
and
associate
however
the
mere
anticipation
of
seeing
the
sea
was
much
and
when
they
had
got
into
a
cab
and
were
going
down
to
victoria
station
eyes
were
filled
with
a
joyful
anticipation
she
had
discarded
altogether
the
descriptions
of
brighton
that
had
been
given
her
it
is
one
thing
to
receive
information
and
another
to
reproduce
it
in
an
imaginative
picture
and
in
fact
her
imagination
was
busy
with
its
own
work
while
she
sat
and
listened
to
this
person
or
the
other
speaking
of
the
seaside
town
she
was
going
to
when
they
spoke
of
promenades
and
drives
and
miles
of
hotels
and
lodging
houses
she
was
thinking
of
the
and
of
the
boats
and
of
the
with
its
distant
ships
when
they
told
her
of
private
theatricals
and
concerts
and
balls
she
was
thinking
of
being
out
on
the
open
sea
with
a
light
breeze
filling
the
sails
and
a
curl
of
white
foam
rising
at
the
bow
and
sweeping
and
hissing
down
the
sides
of
the
boat
she
would
go
down
among
the
fishermen
when
her
husband
and
his
friends
were
not
by
and
talk
to
them
and
get
to
know
what
they
sold
their
fish
for
down
here
in
the
south
she
would
find
out
what
their
nets
cost
and
if
there
was
anybody
in
authority
to
whom
they
could
apply
for
an
advance
of
a
few
pounds
in
case
of
hard
times
had
they
their
cuttings
of
peat
free
from
the
nearest
mossland
and
did
they
dress
their
fields
with
the
thatch
that
had
got
saturated
with
the
smoke
perhaps
some
of
them
could
tell
her
where
the
crews
hailed
from
that
had
repeatedly
shot
the
sheep
of
the
flannen
isles
all
these
and
a
hundred
other
things
she
would
get
to
know
and
she
might
procure
and
send
to
her
father
some
rare
bird
or
curiosity
of
the
sea
that
might
be
added
to
the
little
museum
in
which
she
used
to
sing
in
days
gone
by
when
he
was
busy
with
his
pipe
and
his
whisky
are
not
much
tired
then
by
your
dissipation
of
last
night
said
kavanagh
to
her
at
the
station
as
the
slender
grave
lady
looked
admiringly
at
the
fresh
color
and
bright
eyes
makes
one
envy
you
to
see
you
looking
so
strong
and
in
such
good
happy
you
must
be
always
said
lorraine
and
the
younger
lady
had
the
same
sweet
low
and
kindly
voice
as
her
mother
am
very
well
thank
you
said
sheila
blushing
somewhat
and
not
lifting
her
eyes
while
lavender
was
impatient
that
she
had
not
answered
with
a
laugh
and
some
light
retort
such
as
would
have
occurred
to
almost
any
woman
in
the
circumstances
on
the
journey
down
lavender
and
lorraine
seated
opposite
each
other
in
two
corner
seats
kept
up
a
continual
of
small
pleasantries
in
which
the
young
american
lady
had
distinctly
the
best
of
it
chiefly
by
reason
of
her
perfect
manner
the
keenest
thing
she
said
was
said
with
a
look
of
great
innocence
and
candor
in
the
large
gray
eyes
and
then
directly
afterward
she
would
say
something
very
nice
and
pleasant
in
precisely
the
same
voice
as
if
she
could
not
understand
that
there
was
any
effort
on
the
part
of
either
to
assume
an
advantage
the
mother
sometimes
turned
and
listened
to
this
aimless
talk
with
an
amused
gravity
as
of
a
cat
watching
the
gambols
of
a
kitten
but
generally
she
devoted
herself
to
sheila
who
sat
opposite
her
she
did
not
talk
much
and
sheila
was
glad
of
that
but
the
girl
felt
that
she
was
being
observed
with
some
little
curiosity
she
wished
that
kavanagh
would
turn
those
observant
gray
eyes
of
hers
away
in
some
other
direction
now
and
again
sheila
would
point
out
what
she
considered
strange
or
striking
in
the
country
outside
and
for
a
moment
the
elderly
lady
would
look
out
but
directly
afterward
the
gray
eyes
would
come
back
to
sheila
and
the
girl
knew
they
were
upon
her
at
last
she
so
persistently
stared
out
of
the
window
that
she
fell
to
dreaming
and
all
the
trees
and
the
meadows
and
the
and
the
distant
heights
and
hollows
went
past
her
as
though
they
were
in
a
sort
of
mist
while
she
replied
to
chance
remarks
in
a
mechanical
fashion
and
could
only
hear
as
a
monotonous
murmur
the
talk
of
the
two
people
at
the
other
side
of
the
carriage
how
much
of
the
journey
did
she
remember
she
was
greatly
struck
by
the
amount
of
open
land
in
the
neighborhood
of
london
the
commons
between
wandsworth
and
streatham
and
so
forth
and
she
was
pleased
with
the
appearance
of
the
country
about
red
hill
for
the
rest
a
succession
of
fair
green
pictures
passed
by
her
all
bathed
in
a
calm
summer
sunlight
then
they
pierced
the
which
sheila
at
first
sight
fancied
were
of
granite
and
rumbled
through
the
tunnels
finally
with
just
a
glimpse
of
a
great
mass
of
gray
houses
filling
a
vast
hollow
and
stretching
up
the
bare
green
downs
beyond
they
found
themselves
in
brighton
sheila
what
do
you
think
of
the
place
her
husband
said
to
her
with
a
laugh
as
they
were
driving
down
the
road
she
did
not
answer
is
not
like
borvapost
is
it
she
was
too
bewildered
to
speak
she
could
only
look
about
her
with
a
vague
wonder
and
disappointment
but
surely
this
great
city
was
not
the
place
they
had
come
to
live
in
would
it
not
disappear
somehow
and
they
would
get
away
to
the
sea
and
the
rocks
and
the
boats
they
passed
into
the
upper
part
of
west
street
and
here
was
another
thoroughfare
down
to
which
sheila
glanced
with
no
great
interest
but
the
next
moment
there
was
a
quick
catching
of
her
breath
which
almost
resembled
a
sob
and
a
strange
glad
light
sprang
into
her
eyes
here
at
last
was
the
sea
away
beyond
the
narrow
thoroughfare
she
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
great
green
plain
it
was
in
the
sunlight
that
the
wind
was
whitening
here
and
there
with
tumbling
waves
she
had
not
noticed
that
there
was
any
wind
there
everything
seemed
asleep
but
here
there
was
a
fresh
breeze
from
the
south
and
the
sea
had
been
rough
the
day
before
and
now
it
was
of
this
strange
olive
color
streaked
with
the
white
curls
of
foam
that
shone
in
the
sunlight
was
there
not
a
cold
scent
of
too
blown
up
this
narrow
passage
between
the
houses
and
now
the
carriage
cut
around
the
corner
and
whirled
out
into
the
glare
of
the
parade
and
before
her
the
great
sea
stretched
out
its
leagues
of
tumbling
and
shining
waves
and
she
heard
the
water
roaring
along
the
beach
and
far
away
at
the
horizon
she
saw
a
phantom
ship
she
did
not
even
look
at
the
row
of
splendid
hotels
and
houses
at
the
folks
on
the
pavement
at
the
brilliant
flags
that
were
flapping
and
fluttering
on
the
new
pier
and
about
the
beach
it
was
the
great
world
of
shining
water
beyond
that
fascinated
her
and
awoke
in
her
a
strange
yearning
and
longing
so
that
she
did
not
know
whether
it
was
grief
or
joy
that
burned
in
her
heart
and
blinded
her
eyes
with
tears
kavanagh
took
her
arm
as
they
were
going
up
the
steps
of
the
hotel
and
said
in
a
friendly
way
suppose
you
have
some
sad
memories
of
the
sea
said
sheila
bravely
is
always
pleasant
to
me
to
think
of
the
sea
but
it
is
a
long
time
since
since
said
her
husband
abruptly
tell
me
if
all
your
things
are
here
and
then
the
girl
turned
calm
and
to
look
after
rugs
and
boxes
when
they
were
finally
established
in
the
hotel
lavender
went
off
to
negotiate
for
the
hire
of
a
carriage
for
kavanagh
during
her
stay
and
sheila
was
left
with
the
two
ladies
they
had
tea
in
their
and
they
had
it
at
one
of
the
windows
so
that
they
could
look
out
on
the
stream
of
people
and
carriages
now
beginning
to
flow
by
in
the
clear
yellow
light
of
the
afternoon
but
neither
the
people
nor
the
carriages
had
much
interest
for
sheila
who
indeed
sat
for
the
most
part
silent
intently
watching
the
various
boats
that
were
putting
out
or
coming
in
and
busy
with
conjectures
which
she
knew
there
was
no
use
placing
before
her
two
companions
seems
to
surprise
you
very
much
said
lorraine
said
sheila
have
been
told
all
about
it
but
you
will
forget
all
that
and
this
is
very
different
from
the
sea
at
home
at
my
home
is
in
london
now
said
the
elder
lady
with
a
smile
no
said
sheila
most
anxiously
and
earnestly
that
is
not
our
home
at
all
we
live
there
for
a
time
that
will
be
quite
necessary
but
we
shall
go
back
to
the
lewis
some
day
soon
not
to
stay
altogether
but
enough
to
make
it
as
much
our
home
as
do
you
think
mr
lavender
will
enjoy
living
in
the
hebrides
said
lorraine
with
a
look
of
innocent
and
friendly
inquiry
in
her
eyes
was
many
a
time
that
he
has
said
he
never
liked
any
place
so
much
said
sheila
with
something
of
a
blush
and
then
she
added
with
growing
courage
you
must
not
think
he
is
always
like
what
he
is
here
oh
no
when
he
is
in
the
highlands
there
is
no
day
that
is
nearly
long
enough
for
what
has
to
be
done
in
it
and
he
is
up
very
early
and
away
to
the
hills
or
the
loch
with
a
gun
or
a
he
can
catch
the
salmon
very
well
oh
very
well
for
one
that
is
not
accustomed
and
he
will
shoot
as
well
as
any
one
that
is
in
the
island
except
my
papa
it
is
a
great
deal
to
do
there
will
be
in
the
island
and
plenty
of
amusement
and
there
is
not
much
chance
not
any
whatever
of
his
being
lonely
or
tired
when
we
go
to
live
in
the
kavanagh
and
her
daughter
were
both
amused
and
pleased
by
the
earnest
and
rapid
fashion
in
which
sheila
talked
they
had
generally
considered
her
to
be
a
trifle
shy
and
silent
not
knowing
how
afraid
she
was
of
using
wrong
idioms
or
pronunciations
but
here
was
one
subject
on
which
her
heart
was
set
and
she
had
no
more
thought
as
to
whether
she
said
or
or
whether
she
said
or
indeed
she
forgot
more
than
that
she
was
somewhat
excited
by
the
presence
of
the
sea
and
the
sound
of
the
waves
and
she
was
pleased
to
talk
about
her
life
in
the
north
and
about
her
stay
there
and
how
they
should
pass
the
time
when
she
returned
to
borva
she
neglected
altogether
instructions
that
she
should
not
talk
about
fishing
or
cooking
or
farming
to
his
friends
she
incidentally
revealed
to
kavanagh
and
her
daughter
a
great
deal
more
about
the
household
at
borva
than
he
would
have
wished
to
be
known
for
how
could
they
understand
about
his
wife
having
her
own
cousin
to
serve
at
table
and
what
would
they
think
of
a
young
lady
who
was
proud
of
making
her
shirts
whatever
these
two
ladies
may
have
thought
they
were
very
obviously
interested
and
if
they
were
amused
it
was
in
a
far
from
unfriendly
fashion
lorraine
professed
herself
quite
charmed
with
descriptions
of
her
and
wished
she
could
go
up
to
lewis
to
see
all
these
strange
things
but
when
she
spoke
of
visiting
the
island
when
sheila
and
her
husband
were
staying
there
sheila
was
not
nearly
so
ready
to
offer
her
a
welcome
as
the
daughter
of
a
hospitable
old
highland
man
ought
to
have
been
will
you
go
out
in
a
boat
now
said
sheila
looking
down
to
the
beach
a
boat
what
sort
of
a
boat
said
kavanagh
of
those
little
sailing
boats
it
is
very
good
they
are
as
far
as
i
can
thank
you
said
the
elder
lady
with
a
smile
am
not
fond
of
small
boats
and
the
company
of
the
men
who
go
with
you
might
be
a
little
objectionable
i
should
you
need
not
take
any
men
said
sheila
sailing
of
one
of
those
little
boats
it
is
very
you
mean
to
say
you
could
manage
the
boat
by
yourself
yes
it
is
very
simple
and
my
husband
he
will
help
what
would
you
do
if
you
went
out
might
try
the
fishing
i
do
not
see
where
the
rocks
are
but
we
would
go
off
to
the
rocks
and
put
down
the
anchor
and
try
the
lines
you
would
have
some
ferry
good
fish
for
breakfast
in
the
dear
child
said
kavanagh
know
what
you
propose
to
us
to
go
and
roll
about
in
an
open
boat
in
these
waves
we
should
be
ill
in
five
minutes
but
i
suppose
you
know
what
seasickness
is
said
sheila
i
will
hear
my
husband
speak
of
it
often
and
it
is
only
in
crossing
the
channel
that
people
will
get
this
is
the
sheila
stared
then
she
endeavored
to
recall
her
geography
of
course
this
must
be
a
part
of
the
channel
but
if
the
people
in
the
south
became
ill
in
this
weather
they
must
be
feeble
creatures
her
speculations
on
this
point
were
cut
short
by
the
entrance
of
her
husband
who
came
to
announce
that
he
had
not
only
secured
a
carriage
for
a
month
but
that
it
would
be
around
at
the
hotel
door
in
half
an
hour
whereupon
the
two
american
ladies
said
they
would
be
ready
and
left
the
room
go
off
and
get
dressed
sheila
said
lavender
she
stood
for
a
moment
irresolute
you
mind
she
said
after
a
hesitation
you
would
allow
me
to
go
by
myself
if
you
would
go
to
the
driving
and
let
me
go
down
to
the
shore
nonsense
he
said
will
have
people
fancying
you
are
only
a
how
can
you
go
down
to
the
beach
by
yourself
among
all
those
loafing
vagabonds
who
would
pick
your
pockets
or
throw
stones
at
you
you
must
behave
like
an
ordinary
christian
now
do
like
a
good
girl
get
dressed
and
submit
to
the
restraints
of
civilized
life
it
hurt
you
so
she
left
to
lay
aside
with
some
regret
her
rough
blue
dress
and
he
went
to
see
about
ordering
dinner
had
she
come
down
to
the
sea
then
only
to
live
the
life
that
had
nearly
broken
her
heart
in
london
it
seemed
so
they
drove
up
and
down
the
parade
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
and
the
roar
of
the
carriages
drowned
the
rush
of
the
waves
then
they
dined
in
the
quiet
of
this
still
summer
evening
and
she
could
only
see
the
sea
as
a
distant
and
silent
picture
through
the
windows
while
the
talk
of
her
companions
was
either
about
the
people
whom
they
had
seen
while
driving
or
about
matters
of
which
she
knew
nothing
then
the
blinds
were
drawn
and
the
candles
lit
and
still
their
conversation
murmured
around
her
unheeding
ears
after
dinner
her
husband
went
down
to
the
of
the
hotel
to
have
a
cigar
and
she
was
left
with
kavanagh
and
her
daughter
she
went
to
the
window
and
looked
through
a
chink
in
the
venetian
blinds
there
was
a
beautiful
clear
twilight
abroad
the
darkness
still
of
a
soft
gray
and
up
in
the
pale
of
the
sky
a
large
planet
burned
and
throbbed
soon
the
sea
and
the
sky
would
darken
the
stars
would
come
forth
in
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
and
the
moving
water
would
be
struck
with
a
million
trembling
spots
of
silver
as
the
waves
came
onward
to
the
beach
we
go
out
for
a
walk
till
frank
has
finished
his
cigar
said
sheila
go
out
walking
at
this
time
of
night
said
kavanagh
in
a
kindly
way
would
meet
the
most
unpleasant
persons
besides
going
out
into
the
night
air
would
be
most
is
a
beautiful
night
said
sheila
with
a
sigh
she
was
still
standing
at
the
window
said
kavanagh
going
over
to
her
and
putting
her
hand
in
her
arm
can
not
have
any
moping
you
know
you
must
be
content
to
be
dull
with
us
for
one
night
and
after
we
shall
see
what
we
can
do
to
amuse
but
i
want
to
be
amused
cried
sheila
almost
in
terror
for
some
vision
flashed
on
her
mind
of
a
series
of
parties
would
much
rather
be
left
alone
and
allowed
to
go
about
by
myself
but
it
is
very
kind
of
you
she
hastily
added
fancying
that
her
speech
had
been
somewhat
ungracious
is
very
kind
of
you
i
promised
to
teach
you
cribbage
i
said
sheila
with
much
resignation
and
she
walked
to
the
table
and
sat
down
perhaps
after
all
she
could
have
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
with
some
little
equanimity
in
patiently
trying
to
learn
this
game
in
which
she
had
no
interest
whatever
but
her
thoughts
and
fancies
were
soon
drawn
away
from
cribbage
her
husband
returned
lorraine
had
been
for
some
little
time
at
the
big
piano
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
amusing
herself
by
playing
snatches
of
anything
she
happened
to
remember
but
when
mr
lavender
returned
she
seemed
to
wake
up
he
went
over
to
her
and
sat
down
by
the
piano
she
said
have
all
the
duets
and
songs
you
spoke
of
and
i
am
quite
delighted
with
those
i
have
tried
i
wish
mamma
would
sing
a
second
to
me
how
can
one
learn
without
practising
and
there
are
some
of
those
duets
i
really
should
like
to
learn
after
what
you
have
said
of
i
become
a
substitute
for
your
mamma
he
said
sing
the
second
so
that
i
may
practise
your
cigar
must
have
left
you
in
a
very
amiable
suppose
we
try
he
said
and
he
proceeded
to
open
out
the
roll
of
music
which
she
had
brought
down
shall
we
take
first
he
asked
does
not
much
matter
she
answered
indifferently
and
indeed
she
took
up
one
of
the
duets
at
haphazard
what
was
it
made
companion
suddenly
lift
her
eyes
from
the
and
look
with
surprise
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
she
had
recognized
the
little
prelude
to
one
of
her
own
duets
and
it
was
being
played
by
lorraine
and
it
was
lorraine
who
began
to
sing
in
a
sweet
expressive
and
voice
of
no
great
power
love
in
thine
eyes
forever
plays
and
it
was
she
to
whom
the
answer
was
given
he
in
thy
snowy
bosom
strays
and
then
sheila
sitting
stupefied
and
pained
and
confused
heard
them
sing
together
he
makes
thy
rosy
lips
his
care
and
walks
the
mazes
of
thy
hair
she
had
not
heard
the
short
conversation
which
had
introduced
this
music
and
she
could
not
tell
but
that
her
husband
had
been
practising
these
duets
her
duets
with
some
one
else
for
presently
they
sang
the
rosy
morn
appearing
and
would
that
my
love
could
silently
and
others
all
of
them
in
eyes
sacred
to
the
time
when
she
and
lavender
used
to
sit
in
the
little
room
in
borva
it
was
no
consolation
to
her
that
lorraine
had
but
an
imperfect
acquaintance
with
them
that
oftentimes
she
stumbled
and
went
back
over
a
bit
of
the
accompaniment
that
her
voice
was
far
from
being
striking
lavender
at
all
events
seemed
to
heed
none
of
these
things
it
was
not
as
a
music
master
that
he
sang
with
her
he
put
as
much
expression
of
love
into
his
voice
as
ever
he
had
done
in
the
old
days
when
he
sang
with
his
future
bride
and
it
seemed
so
cruel
that
this
woman
should
have
taken
own
duets
from
her
to
sing
before
her
with
her
own
husband
sheila
learnt
little
more
cribbage
that
evening
kavanagh
could
not
understand
how
her
pupil
had
become
embarrassed
inattentive
and
even
sad
and
asked
her
if
she
was
tired
sheila
said
she
was
very
tired
and
would
go
and
when
she
got
her
candle
lorraine
and
lavender
had
just
discovered
another
duet
which
they
felt
bound
to
try
together
as
the
last
this
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
been
more
or
less
vaguely
pained
by
her
attentions
to
this
young
american
lady
and
yet
she
would
not
admit
to
herself
that
he
was
any
in
the
wrong
she
would
entertain
no
suspicion
of
him
she
would
have
no
jealousy
in
her
heart
for
how
could
jealousy
exist
with
a
perfect
faith
and
so
she
had
repeatedly
reasoned
herself
out
of
these
tentative
feelings
and
resolved
that
she
would
do
neither
her
husband
nor
lorraine
the
injustice
of
being
vexed
with
them
so
it
was
now
what
more
natural
than
that
frank
should
recommend
to
any
one
the
duets
of
which
he
was
particularly
fond
what
more
natural
than
that
this
young
lady
should
wish
to
show
her
appreciation
of
those
songs
by
singing
them
and
who
was
to
sing
with
her
but
he
sheila
would
have
no
suspicion
of
either
and
so
she
came
down
next
morning
determined
to
be
very
friendly
with
lorraine
but
that
forenoon
another
thing
occurred
which
nearly
broke
down
all
her
resolves
said
her
husband
think
i
ever
asked
you
whether
you
rode
used
to
ride
many
times
at
home
she
said
i
suppose
rather
not
ride
here
he
said
lorraine
and
i
propose
to
go
out
presently
be
able
to
amuse
yourself
somehow
till
we
come
lorraine
had
indeed
gone
to
put
on
her
habit
and
her
mother
was
with
her
suppose
i
may
go
out
said
sheila
is
so
very
dull
indoors
and
kavanagh
is
afraid
of
the
east
wind
and
she
is
not
going
no
harm
about
your
going
out
answered
lavender
i
should
have
thought
have
liked
the
comfort
of
watching
the
people
pass
from
the
she
said
nothing
but
went
off
to
her
own
room
and
dressed
to
go
out
why
she
knew
not
but
she
felt
that
she
would
rather
not
see
her
husband
and
lorraine
start
from
the
she
stole
without
going
into
the
and
then
going
through
the
great
hall
and
down
the
steps
found
herself
free
and
alone
in
brighton
it
was
a
beautiful
bright
clear
day
though
the
wind
was
a
trifle
chilly
and
all
around
her
there
was
a
sense
of
space
and
light
and
motion
in
the
shining
skies
the
far
clouds
and
the
heaving
and
noisy
sea
yet
she
had
none
of
the
gladness
of
heart
with
which
she
used
to
rush
out
of
the
house
at
borva
to
drink
in
the
fresh
salt
air
and
feel
the
sunlight
on
her
cheeks
she
walked
away
with
her
face
wistful
and
pensive
along
the
road
scarcely
seeing
any
of
the
people
who
passed
her
and
the
noise
of
the
crowd
and
of
the
waves
hummed
in
her
ears
in
a
distant
fashion
even
as
she
walked
along
the
wooden
railing
over
the
beach
she
stopped
and
watched
some
men
putting
off
a
heavy
and
she
still
stood
and
looked
long
after
the
boat
was
launched
she
would
not
confess
to
herself
that
she
felt
lonely
and
miserable
it
was
the
sight
of
the
sea
that
was
melancholy
it
seemed
so
different
from
the
sea
off
borva
that
had
always
to
her
a
familiar
and
friendly
look
even
when
it
was
raging
and
rushing
before
a
southwest
wind
here
this
sea
looked
vast
and
calm
and
sad
and
the
sound
of
it
was
not
pleasant
to
her
ears
as
was
the
sound
of
the
waves
on
the
rocks
at
borva
she
walked
on
in
a
blind
and
unthinking
fashion
until
she
had
got
far
up
the
parade
and
could
see
the
long
line
of
monotonous
white
cliff
meeting
the
dull
blue
plain
of
the
waves
until
both
disappeared
in
the
horizon
she
returned
to
the
road
a
trifle
tired
and
sat
down
on
one
of
the
benches
there
the
passing
of
the
people
would
amuse
her
and
now
the
pavement
was
thronged
with
a
crowd
of
folks
and
the
centre
of
the
thoroughfare
brisk
with
the
constant
going
and
coming
of
riders
she
saw
strange
old
women
painted
powdered
and
bewigged
in
hideous
imitation
of
youth
pounding
up
and
down
the
level
street
and
she
wondered
what
wild
hallucinations
possessed
the
brains
of
these
poor
creatures
she
saw
troops
of
beautiful
young
girls
with
flowing
hair
clear
eyes
and
bright
complexions
riding
by
a
goodly
company
under
charge
of
a
and
the
world
seemed
to
grow
sweeter
when
they
came
into
view
but
while
she
was
vaguely
gazing
and
wondering
and
speculating
her
eyes
were
suddenly
caught
by
two
riders
whose
appearance
sent
a
throb
to
her
heart
frank
lavender
rode
well
so
did
lorraine
and
though
they
were
paying
no
particular
attention
to
the
crowd
of
they
doubtless
knew
that
they
could
challenge
criticism
with
an
easy
confidence
they
were
laughing
and
talking
to
each
other
as
they
went
rapidly
by
neither
of
them
saw
sheila
the
girl
did
not
look
after
them
she
rose
and
walked
in
the
other
direction
with
a
greater
pain
at
her
heart
than
had
been
there
for
many
a
day
what
was
this
crowd
some
dozen
or
so
of
people
were
standing
around
a
small
girl
who
accompanied
by
a
man
was
playing
a
violin
and
playing
it
very
well
too
but
it
was
not
the
music
that
attracted
sheila
to
the
child
but
partly
that
there
was
a
look
about
the
timid
pretty
face
and
modest
and
honest
eyes
that
reminded
her
of
little
ailasa
and
partly
because
just
at
this
moment
her
heart
seemed
to
be
strangely
sensitive
and
sympathetic
she
took
no
thought
of
the
people
looking
on
she
went
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
pavement
and
found
that
the
small
girl
and
her
companion
were
about
to
go
away
sheila
stopped
the
man
you
let
your
little
girl
come
with
me
into
this
shop
it
was
a
shop
were
going
home
to
dinner
said
the
man
while
the
small
girl
looked
up
with
wondering
eyes
you
let
her
have
dinner
with
me
and
you
will
come
back
in
a
half
an
hour
the
man
looked
at
the
little
girl
he
seemed
to
be
really
fond
of
her
and
saw
that
she
was
very
willing
to
go
sheila
took
her
hand
and
led
her
into
the
shop
putting
her
violin
on
one
of
the
small
marble
tables
while
they
sat
down
at
another
she
was
probably
not
aware
that
two
or
three
idlers
had
followed
them
and
were
staring
with
might
and
main
in
at
the
door
of
the
shop
what
could
this
child
have
thought
of
the
beautiful
and
yet
lady
who
was
so
kind
to
her
who
got
her
all
sorts
of
things
with
her
own
hands
and
asked
her
all
manner
of
questions
in
a
low
gentle
and
sweet
voice
there
was
not
much
in
appearance
to
provoke
fear
or
awe
the
little
girl
shy
at
first
got
to
be
a
little
more
frank
and
told
her
hostess
when
she
rose
in
the
morning
how
she
practised
the
number
of
hours
they
were
out
during
the
day
and
many
of
the
small
incidents
of
her
daily
life
she
had
been
photographed
too
and
her
photograph
was
sold
in
one
of
the
shops
she
was
very
well
content
she
liked
playing
the
people
were
kind
to
her
and
she
did
not
often
get
tired
i
shall
see
you
often
if
i
stay
in
brighton
said
sheila
go
out
every
day
when
it
does
not
rain
very
some
wet
day
you
will
come
and
see
me
and
you
will
have
some
tea
with
me
would
you
like
that
very
much
said
the
small
musician
looking
up
frankly
just
at
this
moment
the
half
hour
having
fully
expired
the
man
appeared
at
the
door
hurry
said
sheila
to
the
little
girl
still
and
drink
out
the
lemonade
then
i
will
give
you
some
little
parcels
which
you
must
put
in
your
she
was
about
to
rise
to
go
to
the
counter
when
she
suddenly
met
the
eyes
of
her
husband
who
was
calmly
staring
at
her
he
had
come
out
after
their
ride
with
lorraine
to
have
a
stroll
up
and
down
the
pavements
and
had
in
looking
in
at
the
various
shops
caught
sight
of
sheila
quietly
having
luncheon
with
this
girl
whom
she
had
picked
up
in
the
streets
you
ever
see
the
like
of
that
he
said
to
lorraine
open
day
with
people
staring
in
and
she
has
not
even
taken
the
trouble
to
put
the
violin
out
of
sight
poor
child
means
no
harm
said
his
companion
we
must
get
her
out
of
this
somehow
he
said
and
so
they
entered
the
shop
sheila
knew
she
was
guilty
the
moment
she
met
her
look
though
she
had
never
dreamed
of
it
before
she
had
indeed
acted
quite
thoughtlessly
perhaps
chiefly
moved
by
a
desire
to
speak
to
some
one
and
to
befriend
some
one
in
her
own
loneliness
you
better
let
this
little
girl
go
said
lavender
to
sheila
somewhat
coldly
as
soon
as
he
had
ordered
an
ice
for
his
companion
she
has
finished
her
lemonade
she
will
go
said
sheila
meekly
i
have
to
buy
some
things
for
her
have
got
a
whole
lot
of
people
around
the
door
he
said
is
very
kind
of
the
people
to
wait
for
her
answered
sheila
with
the
same
composure
have
been
here
half
an
hour
i
suppose
they
will
like
her
music
very
the
little
violiniste
was
now
taken
to
the
counter
and
her
pockets
stuffed
with
packages
of
sugared
fruits
and
other
deadly
delicacies
then
she
was
permittted
to
go
with
half
a
crown
in
her
hand
lorraine
patted
her
shoulder
in
passing
and
said
she
was
a
pretty
little
thing
they
went
home
to
luncheon
nothing
was
said
about
the
incident
of
the
forenoon
except
that
lavender
complained
to
kavanagh
in
a
humorous
way
that
his
wife
had
a
most
extraordinary
fondness
for
beggars
and
that
he
never
went
home
of
an
evening
without
expecting
to
find
her
dining
with
the
nearest
scavenger
and
his
family
lavender
indeed
was
in
an
amiable
frame
of
mind
at
the
meal
during
the
progress
of
which
sheila
sat
by
the
window
of
course
for
she
had
already
lunched
in
company
with
the
tiny
violiniste
and
was
bent
on
making
himself
as
agreeable
as
possible
to
his
two
companions
their
talk
had
drifted
toward
the
wanderings
of
the
two
ladies
on
the
continent
from
that
to
the
niebelungen
frescoes
in
munich
from
that
to
the
niebelungen
itself
and
then
by
easy
transition
to
the
ballads
of
uhland
and
heine
lavender
was
in
one
of
his
most
impulsive
and
brilliant
moods
gay
and
jocular
tender
and
sympathetic
by
turns
and
so
obviously
sincere
in
all
that
his
listeners
were
delighted
with
his
speeches
and
assertions
and
stories
and
believed
them
as
implicitly
as
he
did
himself
sheila
sitting
at
a
distance
saw
and
heard
and
could
not
help
recalling
many
an
evening
in
the
far
north
when
lavender
used
to
fascinate
every
one
around
him
by
the
infection
of
his
warm
and
poetic
enthusiasm
how
he
talked
too
telling
the
stories
of
these
quaint
and
pathetic
ballads
in
his
own
rough
and
ready
translations
while
there
was
no
in
his
face
but
a
thorough
warmth
of
earnestness
and
sometimes
too
she
would
notice
a
quiver
of
the
under
lip
that
she
knew
of
old
when
some
pathetic
point
or
phrase
had
to
be
indicated
rather
than
described
he
was
drawing
pictures
for
them
as
well
as
telling
stories
of
the
three
students
entering
the
room
in
which
the
daughter
lay
dead
of
barbarossa
in
his
cave
of
the
child
who
used
to
look
up
at
heine
as
he
passed
her
in
the
street
by
his
pale
and
strange
face
of
the
last
of
the
band
of
companions
who
sat
in
the
solitary
room
in
which
they
had
sat
and
drank
to
their
memory
of
the
king
of
thule
and
the
deserter
from
strasburg
and
a
thousand
others
is
there
any
of
them
is
there
anything
in
the
world
more
pitiable
than
that
pilgrimage
to
kevlaar
he
said
know
it
of
course
no
oh
you
must
surely
you
remember
the
mother
who
stood
by
the
bedside
of
her
sick
son
and
asked
him
whether
he
would
not
rise
to
see
the
great
procession
go
by
the
window
and
he
tells
her
that
he
can
not
he
is
so
ill
his
heart
is
breaking
for
thinking
of
his
dead
gretchen
know
the
story
sheila
the
mother
begs
him
to
rise
and
come
with
her
and
they
will
join
the
band
of
pilgrims
going
to
kevlaar
to
be
healed
there
of
their
wounds
by
the
mother
of
god
then
you
find
them
at
kevlaar
and
all
the
maimed
and
the
lame
people
have
come
to
the
shrine
and
whichever
limb
is
diseased
they
make
a
waxen
image
of
that
and
lay
it
on
the
altar
and
then
they
are
healed
well
the
mother
of
this
poor
lad
takes
wax
and
forms
a
heart
out
of
it
and
says
to
her
son
that
to
the
mother
of
god
and
she
will
heal
your
sighing
he
takes
the
wax
heart
in
his
hand
and
sighing
he
goes
to
the
shrine
and
there
with
tears
running
down
his
face
he
says
beautiful
queen
of
heaven
i
am
come
to
tell
you
my
grief
i
lived
with
my
mother
in
cologne
near
us
lived
gretchen
who
is
dead
now
blessed
mary
i
bring
you
this
wax
heart
heal
the
wound
in
my
and
then
and
then
sheila
saw
his
lip
tremble
but
he
frowned
and
said
impatiently
a
shame
it
is
to
destroy
such
a
beautiful
story
you
can
have
no
idea
of
it
of
its
simplicity
and
tenderness
pray
let
us
hear
the
rest
of
it
said
lorraine
gently
the
last
scene
you
know
is
a
small
chamber
and
the
mother
and
her
sick
son
are
asleep
the
blessed
mary
glides
into
the
chamber
and
bends
over
the
young
man
and
puts
her
hand
lightly
on
his
heart
then
she
smiles
and
disappears
the
unhappy
mother
has
seen
all
this
in
a
dream
and
now
she
awakes
for
the
dogs
are
barking
loudly
the
mother
goes
over
to
the
bed
of
her
son
and
he
is
dead
and
the
morning
light
touches
his
pale
face
and
then
the
mother
folds
her
hands
and
says
he
rose
hastily
with
a
gesture
of
fretfulness
and
walked
over
to
the
window
at
which
sheila
sat
and
looked
out
she
put
her
hand
up
to
his
he
took
it
next
time
i
try
to
translate
heine
he
said
making
it
appear
that
he
had
broken
off
through
vexation
strange
will
is
a
beautiful
story
said
lorraine
who
had
herself
been
crying
a
little
bit
in
a
covered
way
wonder
i
have
not
seen
a
translation
of
it
come
mamma
lady
leveret
said
we
were
not
to
be
after
so
they
rose
and
left
and
sheila
was
alone
with
her
husband
and
still
holding
his
hand
she
looked
up
at
him
timidly
wondering
perhaps
in
her
simple
way
as
to
whether
she
should
not
now
pour
out
her
heart
to
him
and
tell
him
all
her
griefs
and
fears
and
yearnings
he
had
obviously
been
deeply
moved
by
the
story
he
had
told
so
roughly
surely
now
was
a
good
opportunity
of
appealing
to
him
and
begging
for
sympathy
and
compassion
she
said
and
she
rose
and
came
close
and
bent
down
her
head
to
hide
the
color
in
her
face
he
answered
a
trifle
coldly
be
vexed
with
me
she
said
in
a
low
voice
and
with
her
heart
beginning
to
beat
rapidly
with
you
about
what
he
said
abruptly
alas
all
her
hopes
had
fled
she
shrank
from
the
cold
stare
with
which
she
knew
he
was
regarding
her
she
felt
it
to
be
impossible
that
she
should
place
before
him
those
confidences
with
which
she
had
approached
him
and
so
with
a
great
effort
she
merely
said
we
to
go
to
lady
course
we
are
he
said
you
would
rather
go
to
see
some
blind
fiddler
or
beggar
it
is
really
too
bad
of
you
sheila
to
be
so
forgetful
what
if
lady
leveret
for
example
had
come
into
that
shop
it
seems
to
me
you
are
never
satisfied
with
meeting
the
people
you
ought
to
meet
but
that
you
must
go
and
associate
with
all
the
wretched
cripples
and
beggars
you
can
find
you
should
remember
you
are
a
woman
and
not
a
child
that
people
will
talk
about
what
you
do
if
you
go
on
in
this
mad
way
do
you
ever
see
kavanagh
or
her
daughter
do
any
of
these
things
sheila
had
let
go
his
hand
her
eyes
were
still
turned
toward
the
ground
she
had
fancied
that
a
little
of
that
emotion
that
had
been
awakened
in
him
by
the
story
of
the
german
mother
and
her
son
might
warm
his
heart
toward
herself
and
render
it
possible
for
her
to
talk
to
him
frankly
about
all
that
she
had
been
dimly
thinking
and
more
definitely
suffering
she
was
mistaken
that
was
all
will
try
to
do
better
and
please
you
she
said
and
then
she
went
away
chapter
xv
a
friend
in
need
was
it
a
delusion
that
had
grown
up
in
the
mind
and
held
full
possession
of
it
that
she
was
in
a
world
with
which
she
had
no
sympathy
that
she
should
never
be
able
to
find
a
home
there
that
the
influences
of
it
were
gradually
and
surely
stealing
from
her
her
love
and
confidence
or
was
this
longing
to
get
away
from
the
people
and
the
circumstances
that
surrounded
her
but
the
unconscious
promptings
of
an
incipient
jealousy
she
did
not
question
her
own
mind
closely
on
these
points
she
only
vaguely
knew
that
she
was
miserable
and
that
she
could
not
tell
her
husband
of
the
weight
that
pressed
on
her
heart
here
too
as
they
drove
along
to
have
tea
with
a
certain
lady
leveret
who
was
one
of
especial
patrons
and
to
whom
he
had
introduced
kavanagh
and
her
daughter
sheila
felt
that
she
was
a
stranger
an
interloper
a
wheel
to
the
she
scarcely
spoke
a
word
she
looked
at
the
sea
but
she
had
almost
grown
to
regard
that
great
plain
of
smooth
water
as
a
melancholy
and
monotonous
thing
not
the
bright
and
boisterous
sea
of
her
youth
with
its
winding
channels
its
secret
bays
and
rocks
its
salt
winds
and
rushing
waves
she
was
disappointed
with
the
perpetual
wall
of
white
cliff
where
she
had
expected
to
see
something
of
the
black
and
rugged
shore
of
the
north
she
had
as
yet
made
no
acquaintance
with
the
of
the
place
she
did
not
know
where
the
curers
lived
whether
they
gave
the
fishermen
credit
and
cheated
them
whether
the
people
about
here
made
any
use
of
the
back
of
the
or
could
in
hard
seasons
cook
any
of
the
what
the
ling
and
the
cod
and
the
skate
fetched
where
the
wives
and
the
daughters
sat
and
spun
and
carded
their
wool
whether
they
knew
how
to
make
a
good
dish
of
cockles
boiled
in
milk
she
smiled
to
herself
when
she
thought
of
asking
lorraine
about
any
such
things
but
she
still
cherished
some
vague
hope
that
before
she
left
brighton
she
would
have
some
little
chance
of
getting
near
to
the
sea
and
learning
a
little
of
the
down
in
the
south
and
as
they
drove
along
the
road
on
this
afternoon
she
suddenly
called
out
frank
on
the
steps
of
the
old
ship
hotel
stood
a
small
man
with
a
brown
face
a
brown
beard
and
a
beaver
hat
who
was
calmly
smoking
a
wooden
pipe
and
looking
at
an
old
woman
selling
oranges
in
front
of
him
is
ingram
said
sheila
is
ingram
asked
lorraine
with
considerable
interest
for
she
had
often
heard
lavender
speak
of
his
friend
that
little
man
said
lavender
coldly
he
could
have
wished
that
ingram
had
had
some
little
more
regard
for
appearances
in
so
public
a
place
as
the
main
thoroughfare
of
brighton
you
stop
and
speak
to
him
said
sheila
with
great
surprise
are
late
already
said
her
husband
if
you
would
rather
go
back
and
speak
to
him
than
go
on
with
us
you
sheila
said
nothing
more
and
so
they
drove
on
to
the
end
of
the
parade
where
lady
leveret
held
possession
of
a
big
white
house
with
pillars
overlooking
the
broad
street
and
the
sea
but
next
morning
she
said
to
him
suppose
you
will
be
riding
with
lorraine
this
morning
suppose
should
like
to
go
and
see
ingram
if
he
is
still
there
she
said
generally
call
at
hotels
and
ask
to
see
gentlemen
but
of
course
you
care
for
shall
not
go
if
you
do
not
wish
nonsense
you
may
as
well
go
what
is
the
use
of
professing
to
keep
observances
that
you
understand
and
it
will
be
some
amusement
for
you
for
i
dare
say
both
of
you
will
immediately
go
and
ask
some
old
to
have
luncheon
with
you
or
buy
a
nosegay
of
flowers
for
his
the
permission
was
not
very
gracious
but
sheila
accepted
it
and
very
shortly
after
breakfast
she
changed
her
dress
and
went
out
how
pleasant
it
was
to
know
that
she
was
going
to
see
her
old
friend
to
whom
she
could
talk
freely
the
morning
seemed
to
know
of
her
gladness
and
to
share
in
it
for
there
was
a
brisk
southerly
breeze
blowing
fresh
in
from
the
sea
and
the
leaves
were
leaping
white
in
the
sunlight
there
was
no
more
sluggishness
in
the
air
or
the
gray
sky
or
the
leaden
plain
of
the
sea
sheila
knew
that
the
blood
was
mantling
in
her
cheeks
that
her
heart
was
full
of
joy
that
her
whole
frame
so
tingled
with
life
and
spirit
that
had
she
been
in
borva
she
would
have
challenged
her
deerhound
to
a
race
and
fled
down
the
side
of
the
hill
with
him
to
the
small
bay
of
white
sand
below
the
house
she
did
not
pause
for
a
minute
when
she
reached
the
hotel
she
went
up
the
steps
opened
the
door
and
entered
the
square
hall
there
was
an
odor
of
tobacco
in
the
place
and
several
gentlemen
standing
about
rather
confused
her
for
she
had
to
glance
at
them
in
looking
for
a
waiter
another
minute
would
probably
have
found
her
a
trifle
embarrassed
but
that
just
at
this
crisis
she
saw
ingram
himself
come
out
of
a
room
with
a
cigarette
in
his
hand
he
threw
away
the
cigarette
and
came
forward
to
her
with
amazement
in
his
eyes
is
mr
lavender
has
he
gone
into
the
for
me
he
asked
is
not
here
said
sheila
have
come
for
you
by
for
a
moment
too
ingram
felt
the
eyes
of
the
men
on
him
but
directly
he
said
with
a
fine
air
of
carelessness
that
is
very
good
of
you
shall
we
go
out
for
a
stroll
until
your
husband
comes
so
he
opened
the
door
and
followed
her
outside
into
the
fresh
air
and
the
roar
of
the
waves
sheila
he
said
is
very
good
of
you
really
where
is
mr
lavender
generally
rides
with
lorraine
in
the
what
do
you
do
sit
at
the
you
go
boating
i
have
not
been
in
a
boat
they
do
not
care
for
it
and
yesterday
it
was
a
letter
to
papa
i
was
writing
and
i
could
tell
him
nothing
about
the
people
here
or
the
you
could
not
in
any
case
sheila
i
suppose
you
would
like
to
know
what
they
pay
for
their
lines
and
how
they
dye
their
wool
and
so
on
but
you
would
find
the
fishermen
here
live
in
that
way
at
all
they
are
all
civilized
you
know
they
buy
their
clothing
in
the
shops
they
never
eat
any
sort
of
seaweed
or
dye
with
it
either
however
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
at
present
i
suppose
you
are
returning
to
your
a
quick
look
of
pain
and
disappointment
passed
over
her
face
as
she
turned
to
him
for
a
moment
with
something
of
entreaty
in
her
eyes
came
to
see
you
she
said
perhaps
you
have
an
engagement
i
do
not
wish
to
take
up
any
of
your
time
if
you
please
i
will
go
back
alone
to
sheila
he
said
with
a
smile
and
with
the
old
friendly
look
she
knew
so
well
must
not
talk
like
that
to
me
i
have
it
you
know
i
came
down
to
brighton
because
you
asked
me
to
come
and
my
time
is
altogether
at
your
you
have
no
engagement
just
now
said
sheila
with
her
face
brightening
you
will
take
me
down
to
the
shore
to
see
the
boats
and
nets
or
could
we
go
out
and
run
along
the
coast
for
a
few
miles
it
is
a
very
good
i
should
be
very
glad
said
ingram
slowly
should
be
delighted
but
you
see
your
husband
think
it
he
you
know
it
seem
just
a
little
odd
to
him
if
you
were
to
go
away
like
that
is
to
go
riding
with
lorraine
said
sheila
quite
simply
does
not
want
course
you
told
him
you
were
coming
to
see
you
were
going
to
call
at
the
old
ship
and
i
am
sure
he
would
not
be
surprised
if
i
did
not
return
for
a
long
you
quite
sure
sheila
i
am
quite
well
now
i
shall
tell
you
what
i
am
going
to
do
with
you
i
shall
first
go
and
bribe
some
mercenary
boatman
to
let
us
have
one
of
those
small
boats
committed
to
our
own
exclusive
charge
i
shall
constitute
you
skipper
and
pilot
of
the
craft
and
hold
you
responsible
for
my
safety
i
shall
smoke
a
pipe
to
prepare
me
for
whatever
may
no
said
sheila
must
work
very
hard
and
i
will
see
whether
you
remember
all
that
i
taught
you
in
the
lewis
and
if
we
can
have
some
long
lines
we
might
get
some
fish
will
they
pay
more
than
thirty
shillings
for
their
long
lines
in
this
country
know
said
ingram
believe
most
of
the
fishermen
here
live
upon
the
shillings
they
get
from
the
after
a
little
conversation
about
the
weather
and
their
hard
lot
in
life
so
that
one
talk
to
them
more
than
one
can
why
do
they
need
the
money
are
there
no
fish
know
that
either
i
suppose
there
is
some
good
fishing
in
the
winter
and
sometimes
in
the
summer
they
get
some
big
shoals
of
was
a
letter
i
had
last
week
from
the
sister
of
one
of
the
men
of
the
and
she
will
tell
me
that
they
have
been
very
lucky
all
through
the
last
season
and
it
was
near
six
thousand
ling
they
i
suppose
they
are
in
debt
to
some
curer
up
about
habost
no
not
at
all
it
is
their
own
boat
it
is
not
hired
to
them
and
it
is
a
very
good
boat
that
unlucky
had
slipped
out
inadvertently
the
moment
she
had
uttered
it
she
blushed
and
looked
timidly
toward
her
companion
fearing
that
he
had
noticed
it
he
had
not
how
could
she
have
made
such
a
blunder
she
asked
herself
she
had
been
most
particular
about
the
avoidance
of
the
word
even
in
the
lewis
the
girl
did
not
know
that
from
the
moment
she
had
left
the
steps
of
the
old
ship
in
company
with
that
good
friend
of
hers
she
had
unconsciously
fallen
into
much
of
her
old
pronunciation
and
her
old
habit
of
speech
while
ingram
much
more
familiar
with
the
sheila
of
borvapost
and
loch
roag
than
with
the
sheila
of
notting
hill
and
kensington
gardens
did
not
perceive
the
difference
but
was
mightily
pleased
to
hear
her
talk
in
any
fashion
whatsoever
by
fair
means
or
foul
ingram
managed
to
secure
a
pretty
little
sailing
vessel
which
lay
at
anchor
out
near
the
new
pier
and
when
the
pecuniary
negotiations
were
over
sheila
was
invited
to
walk
down
over
the
loose
stones
of
the
beach
and
take
command
of
the
craft
the
boatman
was
still
very
doubtful
when
he
had
pulled
them
out
to
the
boat
however
and
put
them
on
board
he
speedily
perceived
that
his
handsome
young
lady
not
only
knew
everything
that
had
to
be
done
in
the
way
of
getting
the
small
vessel
ready
but
had
a
very
smart
and
way
of
doing
it
it
was
very
obvious
that
her
companion
did
not
know
half
as
much
about
the
matter
as
she
did
but
he
was
obedient
and
watchful
and
presently
they
were
ready
to
start
the
man
put
off
in
his
boat
to
shore
again
much
relieved
in
mind
but
not
a
little
puzzled
to
understand
where
the
young
lady
had
picked
up
not
merely
her
knowledge
of
boats
but
the
ready
way
in
which
she
put
her
delicate
hands
to
hard
work
and
the
prompt
and
effectual
fashion
in
which
she
accomplished
it
i
belay
away
the
jib
or
reef
the
upper
hatchways
ingram
called
out
to
sheila
when
they
had
fairly
got
under
way
she
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
she
was
still
watching
with
a
critical
eye
the
manner
in
which
the
boat
answered
to
her
wishes
and
then
when
everything
promised
well
and
she
was
quite
satisfied
she
said
you
will
take
my
place
for
a
moment
and
keep
a
good
lookout
i
will
put
on
my
she
surrendered
the
tiller
and
the
mainsail
sheets
into
his
care
and
with
another
glance
ahead
pulled
out
her
gloves
did
not
use
to
fear
the
saltwater
or
the
sun
on
your
hands
sheila
said
her
companion
do
not
now
she
said
frank
would
be
displeased
to
see
my
hands
brown
he
has
himself
such
pretty
what
ingram
thought
about
frank
delicate
hands
he
was
not
going
to
say
to
his
wife
and
indeed
he
was
called
upon
at
this
moment
to
let
sheila
resume
her
post
which
she
did
with
an
air
of
great
satisfaction
and
content
and
so
they
ran
lightly
through
the
curling
and
dashing
water
on
this
brilliant
day
caring
little
indeed
for
the
great
town
that
lay
away
to
leeward
with
its
shining
terraces
surmounted
by
a
faint
cloud
of
smoke
here
all
the
roar
of
carriages
and
people
was
unheard
the
only
sound
that
accompanied
their
talk
was
the
splashing
of
the
waves
at
the
prow
and
the
hissing
and
gurgling
of
the
water
along
the
boat
the
south
wind
blew
fresh
and
sweet
around
them
filling
the
broad
white
sails
and
fluttering
the
small
pennon
up
there
in
the
blue
it
seemed
strange
to
sheila
that
she
should
be
so
much
alone
with
so
great
a
town
close
by
that
under
the
boom
she
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
noisy
parade
without
hearing
any
of
its
noise
and
there
away
to
windward
there
was
no
mere
trace
of
city
life
only
the
great
blue
sea
with
its
waves
flowing
on
toward
them
from
out
of
the
far
horizon
and
with
here
and
there
a
pale
ship
just
appearing
on
the
line
where
the
sky
and
ocean
met
sheila
how
do
you
like
being
on
the
sea
again
said
ingram
getting
out
his
pipe
very
well
but
you
must
not
smoke
ingram
you
must
attend
to
the
you
feel
at
home
in
her
yet
he
asked
am
not
afraid
of
her
said
sheila
regarding
the
lines
of
the
small
craft
with
the
eye
of
a
shipbuilder
she
is
very
narrow
in
the
beam
and
she
carries
too
much
sail
for
so
small
a
thing
i
suppose
they
have
not
any
squalls
on
this
coast
where
you
have
no
hills
and
no
narrows
to
go
remind
you
of
lewis
does
it
he
said
filling
his
pipe
all
the
same
little
out
there
it
does
she
said
turning
to
the
broad
plain
of
the
sea
it
is
not
much
that
is
in
this
country
that
is
like
the
lewis
sometimes
i
think
that
i
shall
be
a
stranger
when
i
go
back
to
the
lewis
and
the
people
will
scarcely
know
me
and
everything
will
be
he
looked
at
her
for
a
second
or
two
then
he
laid
down
his
pipe
which
had
not
been
lit
and
said
to
her
gravely
want
you
to
tell
me
sheila
why
you
have
got
into
a
habit
lately
of
talking
about
many
things
and
especially
about
your
home
in
the
north
in
that
sad
way
you
did
not
do
that
when
you
came
to
london
first
and
yet
it
was
then
that
you
might
have
been
struck
and
shocked
by
the
difference
you
had
no
for
a
long
time
but
is
it
sheila
how
was
she
to
tell
him
for
an
instant
she
was
on
the
point
of
giving
him
all
her
confidence
and
then
somehow
or
other
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
would
be
wronging
her
husband
in
seeking
such
sympathy
from
a
friend
as
she
had
been
expecting
and
expecting
in
vain
from
him
it
is
she
said
in
a
low
voice
while
she
pretended
to
be
busy
tightening
up
the
mainsail
sheet
should
like
to
see
borva
you
want
to
live
there
all
your
life
he
said
know
that
would
be
unreasonable
sheila
even
if
your
husband
could
manage
it
and
i
suppose
he
can
surely
your
papa
does
not
expect
you
to
go
and
live
in
lewis
always
no
she
said
eagerly
must
not
think
my
papa
wishes
anything
like
that
it
will
be
much
less
than
that
he
was
thinking
of
when
he
used
to
speak
to
mr
lavender
about
it
and
i
do
not
wish
to
live
in
the
lewis
always
i
have
no
dislike
to
london
none
at
all
only
that
that
and
here
she
paused
sheila
he
said
in
the
old
paternal
way
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
to
yield
up
all
her
own
wishes
in
the
old
days
of
their
friendship
want
you
to
be
frank
with
me
and
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
i
know
there
is
something
wrong
i
have
seen
it
for
some
time
back
now
you
know
i
took
the
responsibility
of
your
marriage
on
my
shoulders
and
i
am
responsible
to
you
and
to
your
papa
and
myself
for
your
comfort
and
happiness
do
you
understand
she
still
hesitated
grateful
in
her
inmost
heart
but
still
doubtful
as
to
what
she
should
do
look
on
me
as
an
intermeddler
he
said
with
a
smile
no
she
said
have
always
been
our
best
i
have
intermeddled
none
the
less
you
remember
when
i
told
you
that
i
was
prepared
to
accept
the
consequences
it
seemed
so
long
a
time
since
then
once
having
to
intermeddle
i
stop
it
you
see
now
sheila
be
a
good
little
girl
and
do
what
i
tell
you
take
the
boat
a
long
way
out
put
her
head
around
take
down
the
sails
and
let
her
tumble
about
and
drift
for
a
time
till
you
tell
me
all
about
your
troubles
and
then
see
what
can
be
she
obeyed
in
silence
with
her
face
grown
grave
enough
in
anticipation
of
the
coming
disclosures
she
knew
that
the
first
plunge
into
them
would
be
keenly
painful
to
her
but
there
was
a
feeling
at
her
heart
that
this
penance
over
a
great
relief
would
be
at
hand
she
trusted
this
man
as
she
would
have
trusted
her
own
father
she
knew
that
there
was
nothing
on
earth
he
would
not
attempt
if
he
fancied
it
would
help
her
and
she
knew
too
that
having
experienced
so
much
of
his
great
unselfishness
and
kindness
and
thoughtfulness
she
was
ready
to
obey
him
implicitly
in
anything
that
he
could
assure
her
was
right
for
her
to
do
how
far
away
seemed
the
white
cliffs
now
and
the
faint
green
downs
above
them
brighton
lying
farther
to
the
west
had
become
dim
and
yellow
and
over
it
a
cloud
of
smoke
lay
thick
and
brown
in
the
sunlight
a
mere
streak
showed
the
line
of
the
road
and
all
its
carriages
and
people
the
beach
beneath
could
just
be
made
out
by
the
white
dots
of
the
the
brown
seemed
to
be
close
in
shore
the
two
piers
were
foreshortened
into
small
dusky
masses
marking
the
beginning
of
the
sea
and
then
from
these
distant
and
objects
out
here
to
the
side
of
the
small
white
and
pink
boat
that
lay
lightly
in
the
lapping
water
stretched
that
great
and
moving
network
of
waves
with
here
and
there
a
sharp
gleam
of
white
foam
curling
over
amid
the
dark
ingram
took
his
seat
by
side
so
that
he
should
not
have
to
look
in
her
downcast
face
and
then
with
some
little
preliminary
nervousness
and
hesitation
the
girl
told
her
story
she
told
it
to
sympathetic
ears
and
yet
ingram
having
partly
guessed
how
matters
stood
and
anxious
perhaps
to
know
whether
much
of
her
trouble
might
not
be
merely
the
result
of
fancies
which
could
be
reasoned
and
explained
away
was
careful
to
avoid
anything
like
corroboration
he
let
her
talk
in
her
own
simple
and
artless
way
and
the
girl
spoke
to
him
after
a
little
while
with
an
earnestness
which
showed
how
deeply
she
felt
her
position
at
the
very
outset
she
told
him
that
her
love
for
her
husband
had
never
altered
for
a
moment
that
all
the
prayers
and
desire
of
her
heart
were
that
they
two
might
be
to
each
other
as
she
had
at
one
time
hoped
they
would
be
when
he
got
to
know
her
better
she
went
over
all
the
story
of
her
coming
to
london
of
her
first
experiences
there
of
the
conviction
that
grew
upon
her
that
her
husband
was
somehow
disappointed
with
her
and
was
anxious
now
that
she
should
conform
to
the
ways
and
habits
of
the
people
with
whom
he
associated
she
spoke
of
her
efforts
to
obey
his
wishes
and
how
heartsick
she
was
with
her
failures
and
of
the
dissatisfaction
which
he
showed
she
spoke
of
the
people
to
whom
he
devoted
his
life
of
the
way
in
which
he
passed
his
time
and
of
the
impossibility
of
her
showing
him
so
long
as
he
thus
remained
apart
from
her
the
love
she
had
in
her
heart
for
him
and
the
longing
for
sympathy
which
that
love
involved
and
then
she
came
to
the
question
of
lorraine
and
here
it
seemed
to
ingram
she
was
trying
at
once
to
put
her
conduct
in
the
most
favorable
light
and
to
blame
herself
for
her
unreasonableness
lorraine
was
a
pleasant
companion
to
him
she
could
talk
cleverly
and
brightly
she
was
pretty
and
she
knew
a
large
number
of
his
friends
sheila
was
anxious
to
show
that
it
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
that
her
husband
finding
her
so
out
of
communion
with
his
ordinary
surroundings
should
make
an
especial
friend
of
this
graceful
and
fascinating
woman
and
if
at
times
it
hurt
her
to
be
left
alone
but
here
the
girl
broke
down
somewhat
and
ingram
pretended
not
to
know
that
she
was
crying
these
were
strange
things
to
be
told
to
a
man
and
they
were
difficult
to
answer
but
out
of
these
revelations
which
rather
took
the
form
of
a
cry
than
of
any
distinct
statement
he
formed
a
notion
of
position
sufficiently
exact
and
the
more
he
looked
at
it
the
more
alarmed
and
pained
he
grew
for
he
knew
more
of
her
than
her
husband
did
he
knew
the
latent
force
of
character
that
underlay
all
her
submissive
gentleness
he
knew
the
keen
sense
of
pride
her
highland
birth
had
given
her
and
he
feared
what
might
happen
if
this
sensitive
and
proud
heart
of
hers
were
driven
into
rebellion
by
some
possibly
unintentional
wrong
and
this
fearless
girl
who
was
gentle
and
obedient
not
through
any
timidity
or
limpness
of
character
but
because
she
considered
it
her
duty
to
be
gentle
and
obedient
was
to
be
cast
aside
and
have
her
tenderest
feelings
outraged
and
wounded
for
the
sake
of
an
unscrupulous
woman
of
fashion
who
was
not
fit
to
be
ingram
had
never
seen
lorraine
but
he
had
formed
his
own
opinion
of
her
the
opinion
based
upon
nothing
was
wholly
wrong
but
it
served
to
increase
if
that
were
possible
his
sympathy
with
sheila
and
his
resolve
to
interfere
on
her
behalf
at
whatever
cost
he
said
gravely
putting
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
as
if
she
were
still
the
little
girl
who
used
to
run
wild
with
him
about
the
borva
rocks
are
a
good
he
added
to
himself
that
lavender
knew
little
of
the
value
of
the
wife
he
had
got
but
he
dared
not
say
that
to
sheila
who
would
suffer
no
imputation
against
her
husband
to
be
uttered
in
her
presence
however
true
it
might
be
or
however
much
she
had
cause
to
know
it
to
be
true
after
all
he
said
in
a
lighter
voice
think
i
can
do
something
to
mend
all
this
i
will
say
for
frank
lavender
that
he
is
a
thoroughly
good
fellow
at
heart
and
that
when
you
appeal
to
him
and
put
things
fairly
before
him
and
show
him
what
he
ought
to
do
there
is
not
a
more
honorable
and
straightforward
man
in
the
world
he
has
been
forgetful
sheila
he
has
been
led
away
by
these
people
you
know
and
has
not
been
aware
of
what
you
were
suffering
when
i
put
the
matter
before
him
you
will
see
it
will
be
all
right
and
i
hope
to
persuade
him
to
give
up
this
constant
idling
and
take
to
his
work
and
have
something
to
live
for
i
wish
you
and
i
together
could
get
him
to
go
away
from
london
altogether
get
him
to
take
to
serious
landscape
painting
on
some
wild
coast
the
galway
coast
for
not
the
lewis
said
sheila
her
heart
turning
to
the
north
as
naturally
as
the
needle
the
lewis
and
i
should
like
you
and
him
to
live
away
from
hotels
and
luxuries
and
all
such
things
and
he
would
work
all
day
and
you
would
do
the
cooking
in
some
small
cottage
you
could
rent
you
make
me
so
happy
in
thinking
of
that
she
said
with
her
eyes
growing
well
again
why
should
he
not
do
so
there
is
nothing
romantic
or
idyllic
about
it
but
a
good
wholesome
plain
sort
of
life
that
is
likely
to
make
an
honest
painter
of
him
and
bring
both
of
you
some
money
and
you
might
have
a
boat
like
are
drifting
too
far
in
said
sheila
suddenly
rising
we
go
back
now
all
means
he
said
and
so
the
small
boat
was
put
under
canvas
again
and
was
soon
making
way
through
the
breezy
water
all
this
seems
simple
enough
it
said
ingram
said
the
girl
with
her
face
full
of
hope
then
of
course
when
you
are
quite
comfortable
together
and
making
heaps
of
money
you
can
turn
around
and
abuse
me
and
say
i
made
all
the
misery
to
begin
we
do
so
before
when
you
were
very
kind
to
us
she
said
in
a
low
voice
but
that
was
different
to
interfere
on
behalf
of
two
young
folks
who
are
in
love
with
each
other
is
dangerous
but
to
interfere
between
two
people
who
are
married
that
is
a
certain
quarrel
i
wonder
what
you
will
say
when
you
are
scolding
me
sheila
and
bidding
me
get
out
of
the
house
i
have
never
heard
you
scold
is
it
gaelic
or
english
you
prefer
prefer
whichever
can
say
the
nicest
things
to
my
very
good
friends
and
tell
them
how
grateful
i
am
for
their
kindness
to
well
when
they
got
back
to
shore
it
was
one
will
come
and
have
some
luncheon
with
us
said
sheila
when
they
had
gone
up
the
steps
and
into
the
road
that
lady
be
there
lorraine
come
some
other
why
not
come
now
said
sheila
is
not
necessary
that
you
will
see
us
only
to
speak
about
those
things
we
have
been
talking
over
no
not
at
all
if
you
and
mr
lavender
were
by
yourselves
i
should
come
at
are
you
afraid
of
lorraine
said
sheila
with
a
smile
is
a
very
nice
lady
indeed
you
have
no
cause
to
dislike
i
want
to
meet
her
sheila
that
is
all
he
said
and
she
knew
well
by
the
precision
of
his
manner
that
there
was
no
use
trying
to
persuade
him
further
he
walked
along
to
the
hotel
with
her
meeting
a
considerable
stream
of
folks
on
the
way
and
neither
he
nor
she
seemed
to
remember
that
his
costume
a
blue
pilot
jacket
not
a
little
worn
and
soiled
with
the
salt
water
and
a
beaver
hat
that
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
rough
weather
in
the
highlands
was
a
good
deal
more
comfortable
than
elegant
he
said
to
her
as
he
left
her
at
the
hotel
you
mind
telling
lavender
i
shall
drop
in
at
three
and
that
i
expect
to
see
him
in
the
i
keep
him
five
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
and
he
saw
that
she
knew
what
this
appointment
meant
for
her
eyes
were
full
of
gladness
and
gratitude
he
went
away
pleased
at
heart
that
she
put
so
much
trust
in
him
and
in
this
case
he
should
be
able
to
reward
that
confidence
for
lavender
was
really
a
good
sort
of
fellow
and
would
at
once
be
sorry
for
the
wrong
he
had
unintentionally
done
and
be
only
too
anxious
to
set
it
right
he
ought
to
leave
brighton
at
once
and
london
too
he
ought
to
go
away
into
the
country
or
by
the
seaside
and
begin
working
hard
to
earn
money
and
at
the
same
time
and
then
in
his
friendly
solitude
he
would
get
to
know
something
about
character
and
begin
to
perceive
how
much
more
valuable
were
these
genuine
qualities
of
heart
and
mind
than
any
social
graces
such
as
might
lighten
up
a
dull
had
lavender
yet
learnt
to
know
the
worth
of
an
honest
perfect
love
and
unquestioning
devotion
let
these
things
be
put
before
him
and
he
would
go
and
do
the
right
thing
as
he
had
many
a
time
done
before
in
obedience
to
the
lecturing
of
his
friend
ingram
called
at
three
and
went
into
the
there
was
no
one
in
the
long
large
room
and
he
sat
down
at
one
of
the
small
tables
by
the
windows
from
which
a
bit
of
lawn
the
road
and
the
sea
beyond
were
visible
he
had
scarcely
taken
his
seat
when
lavender
came
in
ingram
how
are
you
he
said
in
his
freest
and
friendliest
way
you
come
have
you
had
lunch
why
did
you
go
to
the
ship
always
go
to
the
ship
he
said
thank
you
i
go
are
a
most
unsociable
sort
of
brute
said
lavender
frankly
you
take
a
glass
of
sherry
thank
you
have
a
game
of
billiards
thank
you
you
mean
to
say
you
would
play
billiards
on
such
a
day
as
this
a
fine
day
it
said
lavender
turning
carelessly
to
look
at
the
sunlit
road
and
the
blue
sea
the
way
sheila
tells
me
you
and
she
were
out
sailing
this
morning
it
must
have
been
very
pleasant
especially
for
her
for
she
is
mad
about
such
things
what
a
curious
girl
she
is
to
be
sure
you
think
so
know
what
you
mean
by
curious
said
ingram
coldly
you
know
strange
odd
unlike
other
people
in
her
ways
and
her
fancies
did
i
tell
you
about
my
aunt
taking
her
to
see
some
friends
of
hers
at
norwood
no
well
sheila
had
got
out
of
the
house
somehow
i
suppose
their
talking
did
not
interest
her
and
when
they
went
in
search
of
her
they
found
her
in
the
cemetery
crying
like
a
about
said
lavender
with
a
smile
because
so
many
people
had
died
she
had
never
seen
anything
like
that
before
you
know
the
small
up
in
lewis
with
their
inscriptions
in
norwegian
and
danish
and
german
i
suppose
the
first
sight
of
all
the
white
stones
at
norwood
was
too
much
for
i
see
much
of
a
joke
in
that
said
ingram
said
there
was
any
joke
in
it
cried
lavender
impatiently
never
knew
such
a
cantankerous
fellow
as
you
are
you
are
always
fancying
i
am
finding
fault
with
sheila
and
i
never
do
anything
of
the
kind
she
is
a
very
good
girl
indeed
i
have
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
the
way
our
marriage
has
turned
she
the
words
were
not
important
but
there
was
something
in
the
tone
in
which
they
were
spoken
that
suddenly
checked
frank
careless
flow
of
speech
he
looked
at
ingram
for
a
moment
with
some
surprise
and
then
he
said
do
you
mean
i
will
tell
you
what
i
mean
said
ingram
slowly
is
an
awkward
thing
for
a
man
to
interfere
between
husband
and
wife
i
am
aware
he
gets
something
else
than
thanks
for
his
pains
ordinarily
but
sometimes
it
has
to
be
done
thanks
or
kicks
now
you
know
lavender
i
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
helping
forward
your
marriage
in
the
north
and
i
remind
you
of
that
to
claim
anything
in
the
way
of
consideration
but
to
explain
why
i
think
i
am
called
on
to
speak
to
you
lavender
was
at
once
a
little
frightened
and
a
little
irritated
he
half
guessed
what
might
be
coming
from
the
slow
and
precise
manner
in
which
ingram
talked
that
form
of
speech
had
vexed
him
many
a
time
before
for
he
would
rather
have
had
any
amount
of
wild
contention
and
bandying
about
of
reproaches
than
the
calm
unimpassioned
and
sententious
setting
forth
of
his
shortcomings
to
which
this
sallow
little
man
was
perhaps
too
much
addicted
suppose
sheila
has
been
complaining
to
you
then
said
lavender
hotly
may
suppose
what
absurdities
you
like
said
ingram
quietly
it
would
be
a
good
deal
better
if
you
would
listen
to
me
patiently
and
deal
in
a
common
sense
fashion
with
what
i
have
got
to
say
it
is
nothing
very
desperate
nothing
has
happened
that
is
not
of
easy
remedy
while
the
remedy
would
leave
you
and
her
in
a
much
better
position
both
as
regards
your
own
estimation
of
yourselves
and
the
opinion
of
your
are
a
little
roundabout
ingram
said
lavender
ornate
but
i
suppose
all
lectures
begin
so
go
ingram
laughed
i
am
too
formal
it
is
because
i
want
to
make
mischief
by
any
exaggeration
look
here
a
long
time
before
you
were
married
i
warned
you
that
sheila
had
very
keen
and
sensitive
notions
about
the
duties
that
people
ought
to
perform
about
the
dignity
of
labor
about
the
proper
occupations
of
a
man
and
so
forth
these
notions
you
may
regard
as
romantic
and
absurd
if
you
like
but
you
might
as
well
try
to
change
the
color
of
her
eyes
as
attempt
to
alter
any
of
her
beliefs
in
that
she
thinks
that
i
am
idle
and
indolent
because
i
care
what
a
washerwoman
pays
for
her
candles
said
lavender
with
impetuous
contempt
be
it
so
she
is
welcome
to
her
opinion
but
if
she
is
grieved
at
heart
because
i
make
boots
it
seems
to
me
that
she
might
as
well
come
and
complain
to
myself
instead
of
going
and
detailing
her
wrongs
to
a
third
person
and
calling
for
his
sympathy
in
the
character
of
an
injured
for
an
instant
the
dark
eyes
of
the
man
opposite
him
blazed
with
a
quick
fire
for
a
sneer
at
sheila
was
worse
than
an
insult
to
himself
but
he
kept
quite
calm
and
said
unfortunately
is
not
what
is
troubling
lavender
rose
abruptly
took
a
turn
up
and
down
the
empty
room
and
said
there
is
anything
the
matter
i
prefer
to
hear
it
from
herself
it
is
not
respectful
to
me
that
she
should
call
in
a
third
person
to
humor
her
whims
and
and
fancies
said
ingram
with
that
dark
light
returning
to
his
eyes
you
know
what
you
are
talking
about
do
you
know
that
while
you
are
living
on
the
charity
of
a
woman
you
despise
and
dawdling
about
the
skirts
of
a
woman
who
laughs
at
you
you
are
breaking
the
heart
of
a
girl
who
has
not
her
equal
in
england
whims
and
fancies
good
god
i
wonder
how
she
ever
could
have
he
stopped
but
the
mischief
was
done
these
were
not
prudent
words
to
come
from
a
man
who
wished
to
step
in
as
a
mediator
between
husband
and
wife
but
blaze
of
wrath
kindled
by
what
he
considered
the
insufferable
insolence
of
lavender
in
thus
speaking
of
sheila
had
swept
all
notions
of
prudence
before
it
lavender
indeed
was
much
cooler
than
he
was
and
said
with
an
affectation
of
carelessness
am
sorry
you
should
vex
yourself
so
much
about
sheila
one
would
think
you
had
had
the
ambition
yourself
at
some
time
or
other
to
play
the
part
of
husband
to
her
and
doubtless
then
you
would
have
made
sure
that
all
her
idle
fancies
were
gratified
as
it
is
i
was
about
to
relieve
you
from
the
trouble
of
further
explanation
by
saying
that
i
am
quite
competent
to
manage
my
own
affairs
and
that
if
sheila
has
any
complaint
to
make
she
must
make
it
to
ingram
rose
and
was
silent
for
a
moment
he
said
does
not
matter
much
whether
you
and
i
quarrel
i
was
prepared
for
that
in
any
case
but
i
ask
you
to
give
sheila
a
chance
of
telling
you
what
i
had
intended
to
tell
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
i
never
invite
confidence
when
she
wishes
to
tell
me
anything
she
knows
i
am
ready
to
listen
but
i
am
quite
satisfied
with
the
position
of
affairs
as
they
are
at
help
you
then
said
his
friend
and
went
away
scarcely
daring
to
confess
to
himself
how
dark
the
future
looked

exchanges
just
as
frank
lavender
went
down
stairs
to
meet
ingram
a
letter
which
had
been
forwarded
from
london
was
brought
to
sheila
it
bore
the
lewis
postmark
and
she
guessed
it
was
from
duncan
for
she
had
told
mairi
to
ask
the
tall
keeper
to
write
and
she
knew
he
would
hasten
to
obey
her
request
at
any
sacrifice
of
comfort
to
himself
sheila
sat
down
to
read
the
letter
in
a
happy
frame
of
mind
she
had
every
confidence
that
all
her
troubles
were
about
to
be
removed
now
that
her
good
friend
ingram
had
come
to
her
husband
and
here
was
a
message
to
her
from
her
home
that
seemed
even
before
she
read
it
to
beg
of
her
to
come
thither
and
joyous
this
was
what
she
read
the
island
of
lewis

it

day
for

or

lines
to

this
summer
or
before
the
winter
is
over
whatever
i
remain
honored
mrs
lavender
your
obedient
servant
summer
or
winter
said
sheila
to
herself
with
a
happy
light
on
her
face
not
now
why
should
she
not
go
down
stairs
to
the
of
the
hotel
and
place
this
invitation
in
the
hand
of
her
husband
and
his
friend
would
not
its
garrulous
simplicity
recall
to
both
of
them
the
island
they
used
to
find
so
pleasant
would
not
they
suddenly
resolve
to
leave
london
and
its
ways
and
people
even
this
monotonous
sea
out
there
and
speed
away
northwardly
till
they
came
in
sight
of
the
great
and
rolling
minch
with
its
majestic
breadth
of
sky
and
its
pale
blue
islands
lying
far
away
at
the
horizon
then
the
happy
landing
at
the
stornoway
her
father
and
duncan
and
mairi
all
on
the
quay
the
rapid
drive
over
to
loch
roag
and
the
first
glimpse
of
the
rocky
bays
and
clear
water
and
white
sand
about
borva
and
borvabost
and
sheila
would
once
more
having
cast
aside
this
cumbrous
attire
that
she
had
to
change
so
often
and
having
got
out
that
neat
and
simple
costume
that
was
so
good
for
walking
or
driving
or
sailing
be
proud
to
wait
upon
her
guests
and
help
mairi
in
her
household
ways
and
have
a
pretty
table
ready
for
the
gentlemen
when
they
returned
from
the
shooting
her
husband
came
up
the
hotel
stairs
and
entered
the
room
she
rose
to
meet
him
with
the
open
letter
in
her
hand
he
said
and
the
light
slowly
died
away
from
her
face
have
something
to
ask
of
she
knew
by
the
sound
of
his
voice
that
she
had
nothing
to
hope
it
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
been
disappointed
and
yet
this
time
it
seemed
especially
bitter
somehow
the
awakening
from
these
illusions
was
sudden
she
did
not
answer
so
he
said
in
the
same
measured
voice
have
to
ask
that
you
will
have
henceforth
no
communication
with
ingram
i
do
not
wish
him
to
come
to
the
she
stood
for
a
moment
apparently
not
understanding
the
meaning
of
what
he
said
then
when
the
full
force
of
this
decision
and
request
came
upon
her
a
quick
color
sprang
to
her
face
the
cause
of
which
if
it
had
been
revealed
to
him
in
words
would
have
considerably
astonished
her
husband
but
that
moment
of
doubt
of
surprise
and
of
inward
indignation
was
soon
over
she
cast
down
her
eyes
and
said
meekly
well
it
was
now
his
turn
to
be
astonished
and
mortified
as
well
he
could
not
have
believed
it
possible
that
she
should
so
calmly
acquiesce
in
the
dismissal
of
one
of
her
dearest
friends
he
had
expected
a
more
or
less
angry
protest
if
not
a
distinct
refusal
which
would
have
given
him
an
opportunity
for
displaying
the
injuries
he
conceived
himself
to
have
suffered
at
their
hands
why
had
she
not
come
to
himself
this
man
ingram
was
presuming
upon
his
ancient
friendship
and
on
the
part
he
had
taken
in
forwarding
the
marriage
up
at
borva
he
had
always
moreover
been
somewhat
too
much
of
a
schoolmaster
with
his
severe
judgments
his
sententious
fashion
of
criticising
and
warning
people
and
his
readiness
to
prove
the
whole
world
wrong
in
order
to
show
himself
to
be
right
all
these
and
many
other
things
lavender
meant
to
say
to
sheila
so
soon
as
she
had
protested
against
his
forbidding
ingram
to
come
any
more
to
the
house
but
there
was
no
protest
sheila
did
not
even
seem
surprised
she
went
back
to
her
seat
by
the
window
folded
up
letter
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
and
then
she
turned
to
look
at
the
sea
lavender
regarded
her
for
a
moment
apparently
doubting
whether
he
should
himself
prosecute
the
subject
then
he
turned
and
left
the
room
sheila
did
not
cry
or
otherwise
seek
to
compassionate
herself
her
husband
had
told
her
to
do
a
certain
thing
and
she
would
do
it
perhaps
she
had
been
imprudent
in
having
confided
in
ingram
and
if
so
it
was
right
that
she
should
be
punished
but
the
regret
and
pain
that
lay
deep
in
her
heart
were
that
ingram
should
have
suffered
through
her
and
that
she
had
no
opportunity
of
telling
him
that
though
they
might
not
see
each
other
she
would
never
forget
her
friendship
for
him
or
cease
to
be
grateful
to
him
for
his
unceasing
and
generous
kindness
to
her
next
morning
lavender
was
summoned
to
london
by
a
telegram
which
announced
that
his
aunt
was
seriously
ill
he
and
sheila
got
ready
at
once
left
by
a
forenoon
train
had
some
brief
luncheon
at
home
and
then
went
to
see
the
old
lady
in
kensington
gore
during
their
journey
lavender
had
been
rather
more
kind
and
courteous
toward
sheila
than
was
his
wont
was
he
pleased
that
she
had
so
readily
obeyed
him
in
this
matter
of
giving
up
about
the
only
friend
she
had
in
london
or
was
he
moved
by
some
visitation
of
compunction
sheila
tried
to
show
that
she
was
grateful
for
his
kindness
but
there
was
that
between
them
which
could
not
be
removed
by
chance
phrases
or
attentions
mrs
lavender
was
in
her
own
room
paterson
brought
word
that
she
wanted
to
see
sheila
first
alone
so
lavender
sat
down
in
the
gloomy
by
the
window
and
watched
the
people
riding
or
driving
past
and
the
sunshine
on
the
dusty
green
trees
in
the
park
frank
lavender
below
said
the
thin
old
woman
who
was
propped
up
in
bed
with
some
scarlet
garment
around
her
that
made
her
resemble
more
than
ever
the
cockatoo
of
which
sheila
had
thought
on
first
seeing
her
said
sheila
want
to
see
you
alone
i
bear
him
dawdling
about
a
room
and
staring
at
things
and
saying
nothing
does
he
speak
to
you
sheila
did
not
wish
to
enter
into
any
controversy
about
the
habits
of
her
husband
so
she
said
hope
you
will
see
him
before
he
goes
mrs
lavender
he
is
very
anxious
to
know
how
you
are
and
i
am
glad
to
find
you
looking
so
well
you
do
not
look
like
an
invalid
at
not
going
to
die
yet
said
the
little
dried
old
woman
with
the
harsh
voice
the
staring
eyes
and
the
tightly
twisted
gray
hair
hope
you
come
to
read
the
bible
to
me
you
find
one
about
in
any
case
i
should
think
if
you
like
to
sit
down
and
read
the
sayings
of
the
emperor
marcus
antoninus
i
should
enjoy
that
but
i
suppose
you
are
too
busy
thinking
what
dress
wear
at
my
i
was
thinking
of
no
such
thing
said
sheila
indignantly
but
feeling
all
the
same
that
the
hard
glittering
expressionless
eyes
were
watching
her
you
think
i
believe
you
said
mrs
lavender
i
hope
i
am
able
to
recognize
the
facts
of
life
if
you
were
to
die
this
afternoon
i
should
get
a
black
silk
trimmed
with
crape
the
moment
i
got
on
my
feet
again
and
go
to
your
funeral
in
the
ordinary
way
i
hope
you
will
pay
me
the
same
respect
do
you
think
i
am
afraid
to
speak
of
these
things
should
you
speak
of
them
said
sheila
despairingly
it
does
you
good
to
contemplate
the
worst
that
can
befall
you
and
if
it
does
not
happen
you
may
rejoice
and
it
will
happen
i
know
i
shall
be
lying
in
this
bed
with
half
a
dozen
of
you
around
about
trying
to
cry
and
wondering
which
will
have
the
courage
to
turn
and
go
out
of
the
room
first
then
there
will
be
the
funeral
day
and
paterson
will
be
careful
about
the
blinds
and
go
about
the
house
on
her
as
if
i
were
likely
to
hear
then
there
will
be
a
pretty
service
up
in
the
cemetery
and
a
man
who
never
saw
me
will
speak
of
his
dear
sister
departed
and
then
all
go
home
and
have
your
dinner
am
i
afraid
of
it
should
you
talk
like
that
said
sheila
piteously
are
not
going
to
die
you
distress
yourself
and
others
by
thinking
of
those
horrible
dear
child
there
is
nothing
horrible
in
nature
everything
is
part
of
the
universal
system
which
you
should
recognize
and
accept
if
you
had
but
trained
yourself
now
by
the
study
of
philosophical
works
to
know
how
helpless
you
are
to
alter
the
facts
of
life
and
how
it
is
the
best
wisdom
to
be
prepared
for
the
worst
you
would
find
nothing
horrible
in
thinking
of
your
own
funeral
you
are
not
looking
sheila
was
startled
by
the
suddenness
of
the
announcement
i
am
a
little
tired
with
the
traveling
we
have
done
frank
lavender
kind
to
you
what
was
she
to
say
with
those
two
eyes
scanning
her
face
is
too
soon
to
expect
him
to
be
anything
else
she
said
with
an
effort
at
a
smile
so
you
are
beginning
to
talk
in
that
way
i
thought
you
were
full
of
sentimental
notions
of
life
when
you
came
to
london
it
is
not
a
good
place
for
maturing
such
is
not
said
sheila
surprised
into
a
sigh
nearer
be
afraid
i
shall
bite
you
i
am
not
so
ferocious
as
i
sheila
rose
and
went
closer
to
the
bedside
and
the
old
woman
stretched
out
a
lean
and
withered
hand
to
her
i
thought
that
that
silly
fellow
behaving
well
to
you
will
not
listen
to
you
said
sheila
suddenly
withdrawing
her
hand
while
a
quick
color
leapt
to
her
face
will
not
listen
to
you
if
you
speak
of
my
husband
in
that
will
speak
of
him
any
way
i
like
get
into
a
rage
i
have
known
frank
lavender
a
good
deal
longer
than
you
have
what
i
was
going
to
say
is
this
that
if
i
thought
he
was
not
behaving
well
to
you
i
would
play
him
a
trick
i
would
leave
my
money
which
is
all
he
has
got
to
live
on
to
you
and
when
i
died
he
would
find
himself
dependent
on
you
for
every
farthing
he
wanted
to
and
the
old
woman
laughed
with
very
little
of
the
weakness
of
an
invalid
in
the
look
of
her
face
but
sheila
when
she
had
mastered
her
surprise
and
resolved
not
to
be
angry
said
calmly
i
have
whatever
i
might
have
that
belongs
to
my
husband
not
to
you
speak
like
a
sensible
girl
said
mrs
lavender
is
the
misfortune
of
a
wife
that
she
can
not
keep
her
own
money
to
herself
but
there
are
means
by
which
the
law
may
be
defeated
my
dear
i
have
been
thinking
it
over
i
have
been
speaking
of
it
to
ingram
for
i
have
suspected
for
some
time
that
my
nephew
frank
was
not
behaving
lavender
said
sheila
with
a
face
too
proud
and
indignant
for
tears
do
not
understand
me
no
one
has
the
right
to
imagine
anything
against
my
husband
and
to
seek
to
punish
him
through
me
and
when
i
said
that
everything
i
have
belongs
to
him
i
was
not
thinking
of
the
law
no
but
only
this
that
everything
i
have
or
might
have
would
belong
to
him
as
i
myself
belong
to
him
of
my
own
free
will
and
gift
and
i
would
have
no
money
or
anything
else
that
was
not
entirely
are
a
said
sheila
struggling
to
repress
her
tears
if
i
were
to
leave
every
farthing
of
my
property
to
a
hospital
where
would
frank
lavender
be
then
could
earn
his
own
living
without
any
such
help
said
sheila
proudly
for
she
had
never
yet
given
up
the
hope
that
her
husband
would
fulfill
the
fair
promise
of
an
earlier
time
and
win
great
renown
for
himself
in
striving
to
please
her
as
he
had
many
a
time
vowed
he
would
do
has
taken
great
care
to
conceal
his
powers
in
that
way
said
the
old
woman
with
a
sneer
if
he
has
whose
fault
is
it
the
girl
said
warmly
has
kept
him
in
idleness
but
yourself
and
now
you
blame
him
for
it
i
wish
he
had
never
had
any
of
your
money
i
wish
he
were
never
to
have
any
more
of
and
then
sheila
stopped
with
a
terrible
dread
falling
over
her
what
had
she
not
said
the
pride
of
her
race
had
carried
her
so
far
and
she
had
given
expression
to
all
the
tumult
of
her
heart
but
had
she
not
betrayed
her
duty
as
a
wife
and
grievously
compromised
the
interests
of
her
husband
and
yet
the
indignation
in
her
bosom
was
too
strong
to
admit
of
her
retracting
those
fatal
phrases
and
begging
forgiveness
she
stood
for
a
moment
irresolute
and
she
knew
that
the
invalid
was
regarding
her
curiously
as
though
she
were
some
wild
animal
and
not
an
ordinary
resident
in
bayswater
are
a
little
mad
but
you
are
a
good
girl
and
i
want
to
be
friends
with
you
you
have
in
you
the
spirit
of
a
dozen
frank
will
never
make
friends
with
me
by
speaking
ill
of
my
husband
said
sheila
with
the
same
proud
and
indignant
look
when
he
you
does
not
me
what
has
ingram
been
saying
to
you
the
sudden
question
would
certainly
have
brought
about
a
disclosure
if
any
were
to
have
been
made
but
mrs
lavender
assured
sheila
that
ingram
had
told
her
nothing
that
she
had
been
forming
her
own
conclusions
and
that
she
still
doubted
that
they
were
right
sit
down
and
read
to
me
you
will
find
marcus
antoninus
on
the
top
of
those
is
in
the
observed
sheila
mildly
can
wait
said
the
old
woman
sharply
but
you
can
not
expect
me
to
keep
him
waiting
with
a
smile
which
did
not
conceal
her
very
definite
purpose
ring
and
bid
him
come
up
you
will
soon
get
rid
of
those
absurd
sheila
rang
the
bell
and
sent
paterson
down
for
lavender
but
she
did
not
betake
herself
to
marcus
antoninus
she
waited
a
few
minutes
and
then
her
husband
made
his
appearance
whereupon
she
sat
down
and
left
to
him
the
agreeable
duty
of
talking
with
this
toothless
old
heathen
about
funerals
and
lingering
death
aunt
lavender
i
am
sorry
to
hear
you
have
been
ill
but
i
suppose
you
are
getting
all
right
again
to
judge
by
your
am
not
nearly
as
ill
as
you
wonder
you
did
not
say
remarked
lavender
carelessly
are
always
attributing
the
most
charitable
feelings
to
your
lavender
said
the
old
lady
who
was
a
little
pleased
by
this
bit
of
flattery
you
come
here
to
make
yourself
impertinent
and
disagreeable
you
can
go
again
your
wife
and
i
get
on
very
well
without
am
glad
to
hear
it
he
said
suppose
you
have
been
telling
her
what
is
the
matter
with
have
not
i
know
i
have
had
a
pain
in
the
head
and
two
fits
and
i
dare
say
the
next
will
carry
me
off
the
doctors
tell
me
anything
about
it
so
i
suppose
it
is
cried
lavender
to
look
at
you
one
would
say
you
never
had
been
ill
in
your
tell
stories
frank
lavender
i
know
i
look
like
a
corpse
but
i
mind
it
for
i
avoid
the
and
keep
the
spectacle
for
my
friends
i
expect
the
next
fit
will
kill
tell
you
what
it
is
aunt
lavender
if
you
would
only
get
up
and
come
with
us
for
a
drive
in
the
park
you
would
find
there
was
nothing
of
an
invalid
about
you
and
we
should
take
you
home
to
a
quiet
dinner
at
notting
hill
and
sheila
would
sing
to
you
all
the
evening
and
you
would
receive
the
doctors
in
state
in
your
and
tell
them
you
were
going
for
a
month
to
husband
has
a
fine
imagination
my
dear
said
mrs
lavender
to
sheila
is
a
pity
he
puts
it
to
no
use
now
i
shall
let
both
of
you
go
three
breathing
in
this
room
are
too
many
for
the
cubic
feet
of
air
it
contains
frank
bring
over
those
scales
and
put
them
on
the
table
and
send
paterson
to
me
as
you
go
and
so
they
went
down
stairs
and
out
of
the
house
just
as
they
stood
on
the
steps
looking
for
a
hansom
a
young
lad
came
forward
and
shook
hands
with
lavender
glancing
nervously
at
sheila
mosenberg
said
lavender
come
back
from
leipsic
at
last
we
got
your
card
when
we
came
home
this
morning
from
brighton
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
the
boy
looked
at
the
beautiful
face
before
him
with
something
of
a
distant
wonder
and
reverence
in
his
regard
sheila
had
heard
of
the
lad
before
of
the
mendelssohn
that
was
to
be
and
liked
his
appearance
at
first
sight
he
was
a
rather
handsome
boy
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
of
the
fair
jew
type
with
large
dark
expressive
eyes
and
long
wavy
hair
he
spoke
english
fluently
and
well
his
slight
german
accent
was
indeed
scarcely
so
distinct
as
highland
one
the
chief
peculiarity
of
his
speaking
being
a
preference
for
short
sentences
as
if
he
were
afraid
to
venture
upon
elaborate
english
he
had
not
addressed
a
dozen
sentences
to
sheila
before
she
had
begun
to
have
a
liking
for
the
lad
perhaps
on
account
of
his
soft
and
musical
voice
perhaps
on
account
of
the
respectful
and
almost
wondering
admiration
that
dwelt
in
his
eyes
he
spoke
to
her
as
if
she
were
some
saint
who
had
but
to
smile
to
charm
and
bewilder
the
humble
worshipper
at
her
shrine
was
intending
to
call
upon
mrs
lavender
madame
he
said
heard
that
she
was
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
if
she
is
seems
to
be
very
well
and
in
very
good
spirits
sheila
answered
i
will
not
go
in
did
you
propose
to
take
a
walk
in
the
park
madame
lavender
inwardly
laughed
at
the
audacity
of
the
lad
and
seeing
that
sheila
hesitated
humored
him
by
saying
we
were
thinking
of
calling
on
one
or
two
people
before
going
home
to
dinner
but
i
seen
you
for
a
long
time
mosenberg
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me
how
you
succeeded
at
the
conservatoire
if
you
like
to
walk
with
us
for
a
bit
we
can
give
you
something
to
eat
at
would
be
very
pleasant
for
me
said
the
boy
blushing
somewhat
it
does
not
incommode
you
madame
no
i
hope
you
will
come
said
sheila
most
heartily
and
so
they
set
out
for
a
walk
through
kensington
gardens
northward
precious
little
did
lavender
learn
about
leipsic
during
that
walk
the
boy
devoted
himself
wholly
to
sheila
he
had
heard
frequently
of
her
and
he
knew
of
her
coming
from
the
wild
and
romantic
hebrides
and
he
began
to
tell
her
of
all
the
experiments
that
composers
had
made
in
representing
the
sound
of
seas
and
storms
and
winds
howling
through
caverns
washed
by
the
waves
lavender
liked
music
well
enough
and
could
himself
play
and
sing
a
little
but
this
enthusiasm
rather
bored
him
he
wanted
to
know
if
the
yellow
wine
was
still
as
cool
and
clear
as
ever
down
in
the
twilight
of
cellar
what
burlesques
had
lately
been
played
at
the
theatre
and
whether
such
and
such
a
was
still
to
the
fore
whereas
he
heard
only
analyses
of
overtures
and
descriptions
of
the
uses
of
particular
musical
instruments
and
a
wild
rhapsody
about
moonlit
seas
the
sweetness
of
french
horns
the
king
of
thule
and
a
dozen
other
matters
he
said
you
go
calling
on
people
you
ought
to
visit
an
english
tailor
people
will
think
you
belong
to
a
german
have
been
to
a
tailor
said
the
lad
with
a
frank
laugh
parents
madame
wish
me
to
be
quite
english
that
is
why
i
am
sent
to
live
in
london
while
they
are
in
frankfort
i
stay
with
some
very
good
friends
of
mine
who
are
very
musical
and
they
are
not
annoyed
by
my
practising
as
other
people
would
hope
you
will
sing
something
to
us
this
evening
said
sheila
will
sing
and
play
for
you
all
the
evening
he
said
lightly
you
are
tired
but
you
must
tell
me
when
you
are
tired
for
who
can
tell
how
much
music
will
be
enough
sometimes
two
or
three
songs
are
more
than
enough
to
make
people
wish
you
need
have
no
fear
of
tiring
me
said
sheila
when
you
are
tired
i
will
sing
for
of
course
you
sing
madame
he
said
casting
down
his
eyes
knew
that
when
i
saw
sheila
had
got
a
sweetheart
and
lavender
saw
it
and
smiled
the
awe
and
reverence
with
which
this
lad
regarded
the
beautiful
woman
beside
him
was
something
new
and
odd
in
kensington
gardens
yet
it
was
the
way
of
those
boys
he
had
himself
had
his
imaginative
fits
of
worship
in
which
some
very
ordinary
young
woman
who
ate
a
good
breakfast
and
spent
an
hour
and
a
half
in
arranging
her
hair
before
going
out
was
regarded
as
some
beautiful
goddess
fresh
risen
from
the
sea
or
descended
from
the
clouds
young
mosenberg
was
just
at
the
proper
age
for
these
foolish
dreams
he
could
sing
songs
to
sheila
and
reveal
to
her
in
that
way
a
passion
of
which
he
dared
not
otherwise
speak
he
would
compose
pieces
of
music
for
her
and
dedicate
them
to
her
and
spend
half
his
quarterly
allowance
in
having
them
printed
he
would
grow
to
consider
him
lavender
a
heartless
brute
and
cherish
dark
notions
of
poisoning
him
but
for
the
pain
it
might
cause
to
her
remember
whether
you
smoke
mosenberg
lavender
said
after
dinner
a
cigarette
sometimes
said
the
lad
if
mrs
lavender
is
going
away
perhaps
she
will
let
me
go
into
the
with
her
there
is
that
sonata
of
muzio
clementi
madame
which
i
will
try
to
remember
for
you
if
you
right
said
lavender
find
me
in
the
next
room
on
the
left
when
you
will
get
tired
of
your
music
and
want
a
cigar
i
think
you
used
to
beat
me
at
chess
you
do
not
know
we
will
try
once
more
then
sheila
and
he
went
into
the
by
themselves
and
while
she
took
a
seat
near
the
he
opened
the
piano
at
once
and
sat
down
he
turned
up
his
cuffs
he
took
a
look
at
the
pedals
he
threw
back
his
head
shaking
his
long
brown
hair
and
then
with
a
crash
like
thunder
his
two
hands
struck
the
keys
he
had
forgotten
all
about
that
sonata
it
was
a
fantasia
of
his
own
based
on
the
airs
in
that
he
played
and
as
he
played
poor
little
piano
suffered
somewhat
never
before
had
it
been
so
battered
about
and
she
wished
the
small
chamber
were
a
great
hall
to
temper
the
voluminous
noise
of
this
opening
passage
but
presently
the
music
softened
the
white
lithe
fingers
ran
lightly
over
the
keys
so
that
the
notes
seemed
to
ripple
out
like
the
prattling
of
a
stream
and
then
again
some
stately
and
majestic
air
or
some
joyous
burst
of
song
would
break
upon
this
light
accompaniment
and
lead
up
to
another
roar
and
rumble
of
noise
it
was
a
very
fine
performance
doubtless
but
what
sheila
remarked
most
was
the
enthusiasm
of
the
lad
she
was
to
see
more
of
that
he
said
is
nothing
it
is
to
get
fingers
accustomed
to
the
keys
you
play
anything
that
is
loud
and
rapid
but
if
you
please
madame
shall
i
sing
you
something
do
said
sheila
will
sing
for
you
a
little
german
song
which
i
believe
jenny
lind
used
to
sing
but
i
never
heard
her
sing
you
know
german
little
is
only
the
cry
of
some
one
who
is
far
away
about
his
sweetheart
it
is
very
simple
both
in
the
words
and
the
and
he
began
to
sing
in
a
voice
so
rich
so
tender
and
expressive
that
sheila
sat
amazed
and
bewildered
to
hear
him
where
had
this
boy
caught
such
a
trick
of
passion
or
was
it
really
a
trick
that
threw
into
his
voice
all
the
pathos
of
a
strong
love
and
grief
he
had
a
powerful
baritone
of
unusual
compass
and
rare
sweetness
but
it
was
not
the
art
of
his
singing
but
the
passionate
abandonment
of
it
that
thrilled
sheila
and
indeed
brought
tears
to
her
eyes
how
had
this
mere
lad
learned
all
the
yearning
and
despair
of
love
that
he
sang
dir
debt
die
brust
dir
schlägt
dies
herz
du
meine
lust
o
du
mein
schmerz
nur
an
den
winden
den
sternen
der
höh
muss
ich
verkünden
mein
süsses
weh
as
though
his
heart
were
breaking
when
he
had
finished
he
paused
for
a
moment
or
two
before
leaving
the
piano
and
then
he
came
over
to
where
sheila
sat
she
fancied
there
was
a
strange
look
in
his
face
as
of
one
who
had
been
really
experiencing
the
wild
emotions
of
which
he
sang
but
he
said
in
his
ordinary
careful
way
of
speaking
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
translate
the
words
for
you
into
english
they
are
too
simple
and
they
have
what
is
common
in
most
german
songs
a
mingling
of
the
pleasure
and
the
sadness
of
being
in
love
that
would
not
read
natural
perhaps
in
english
when
he
says
to
her
that
she
is
his
greatest
delight
and
also
his
greatest
grief
it
is
quite
right
in
the
german
but
not
in
the
where
have
you
learned
all
these
things
she
said
to
him
talking
to
him
as
if
he
were
a
mere
child
and
looking
without
fear
into
his
handsome
boyish
face
and
fine
eyes
down
and
tell
me
that
is
the
song
of
some
one
whose
sweetheart
is
far
away
you
said
but
you
sang
it
as
if
you
yourself
had
some
sweetheart
far
i
have
madame
he
said
seriously
i
sing
the
song
i
think
of
her
then
so
that
i
almost
cry
for
who
is
she
said
sheila
gently
she
very
far
away
do
not
know
said
the
lad
absently
do
not
know
who
she
is
sometimes
i
think
she
is
a
beautiful
woman
away
at
petersburg
singing
in
the
opera
house
there
or
i
think
she
has
sailed
away
in
a
ship
from
you
do
not
sing
about
any
particular
person
said
sheila
with
an
innocent
wonder
appearing
in
her
eyes
no
not
at
all
said
the
boy
and
then
he
added
with
some
suddenness
you
think
madame
any
fine
songs
like
that
or
any
fine
words
that
go
to
the
heart
of
people
are
written
about
any
one
person
oh
no
the
man
has
a
great
desire
in
him
to
say
something
beautiful
or
sad
and
he
says
it
not
to
one
person
but
to
all
the
world
and
all
the
world
takes
it
from
him
as
a
gift
sometimes
yes
he
will
think
of
one
woman
or
he
will
dedicate
the
music
to
her
or
he
will
compose
it
for
her
wedding
but
the
feeling
in
his
heart
is
greater
than
any
that
he
has
for
her
can
you
believe
madame
that
mendelssohn
wrote
the
hochzeitm
the
wedding
march
for
any
one
wedding
no
it
was
all
the
marriage
joy
of
the
world
he
put
into
his
music
and
every
one
knows
that
and
you
hear
it
at
this
wedding
at
that
wedding
but
you
know
it
belongs
to
something
far
away
and
more
beautiful
than
the
marriage
of
any
one
bride
with
her
sweetheart
and
if
you
will
pardon
me
madame
speaking
about
myself
it
is
about
some
one
i
never
knew
who
is
far
more
beautiful
and
precious
to
me
than
any
one
i
ever
knew
that
i
try
to
think
when
i
sing
these
sad
songs
and
then
i
think
of
her
far
away
and
not
likely
ever
to
see
me
some
day
you
will
find
that
you
have
met
her
in
real
life
sheila
said
you
will
find
her
far
more
beautiful
and
kind
to
you
than
anything
you
dreamed
about
and
you
will
try
to
write
your
best
music
to
give
to
her
and
then
if
you
should
be
unhappy
you
will
find
how
much
worse
is
the
real
unhappiness
about
one
you
love
than
the
sentiment
of
a
song
you
can
lay
aside
at
any
the
lad
looked
at
her
can
you
know
about
unhappiness
madame
he
said
with
a
frank
and
gentle
simplicity
that
she
liked
said
sheila
people
get
married
and
begin
to
experience
the
cares
of
the
world
they
must
expect
to
be
unhappy
not
you
he
said
with
some
touch
of
protest
in
his
voice
as
if
it
were
impossible
the
world
should
deal
harshly
with
so
young
and
beautiful
and
tender
a
creature
can
have
nothing
but
enjoyment
around
you
every
one
must
try
to
please
you
you
need
only
condescend
to
speak
to
people
and
they
are
grateful
to
you
for
a
great
favor
perhaps
madame
you
think
i
am
impertinent
he
stopped
and
blushed
while
sheila
herself
with
a
little
touch
of
color
answered
him
that
she
hoped
he
would
always
speak
to
her
quite
frankly
and
then
suggested
that
he
might
sing
once
more
for
her
well
he
said
as
he
sat
down
to
the
piano
is
not
any
more
a
sad
song
it
is
about
a
young
lady
who
will
not
let
her
sweetheart
kiss
her
except
on
conditions
you
shall
hear
the
conditions
and
what
he
sheila
began
to
wonder
whether
this
lad
had
been
imposing
on
her
the
song
was
acted
as
well
as
sung
it
consisted
chiefly
of
a
dialogue
between
the
two
lovers
and
the
boy
with
a
wonderful
ease
and
grace
and
skill
mimicked
the
shy
coquetries
of
the
girl
her
fits
of
petulance
and
dictation
and
the
pathetic
remonstrances
of
her
companion
his
humble
entreaties
and
his
final
sullenness
which
is
only
conquered
by
her
sudden
and
ample
consent
a
rare
faculty
of
artistic
representation
this
precocious
boy
must
have
she
thought
he
really
exhibits
all
those
moods
and
whims
and
tricks
of
manner
without
having
himself
been
in
the
position
of
the
despairing
and
imploring
lover
were
not
thinking
of
the
beautiful
lady
in
petersburg
when
you
were
singing
just
now
sheila
said
on
his
coming
back
to
her
no
he
said
carelessly
is
nothing
you
have
not
to
imagine
anything
these
people
you
see
them
on
every
stage
in
the
comedies
and
that
might
happen
in
actual
life
said
sheila
still
not
quite
sure
about
him
you
know
that
many
people
would
think
you
must
have
yourself
been
teased
in
that
way
or
you
could
not
imitate
it
so
naturally
oh
no
madame
he
said
seriously
should
not
act
that
way
if
i
were
in
love
with
a
woman
if
i
found
her
a
liking
to
make
her
amusement
out
of
our
relations
i
should
say
to
her
mademoiselle
we
have
both
made
a
little
you
might
be
so
much
in
love
with
her
that
you
could
not
leave
her
without
being
very
might
be
very
much
in
love
with
her
yes
but
i
would
rather
go
away
and
be
miserable
than
be
humiliated
by
such
a
girl
why
do
you
smile
madame
do
you
think
i
am
vain
or
that
i
am
too
young
to
know
anything
about
that
perhaps
both
are
true
but
one
can
not
help
said
sheila
with
a
grandly
maternal
air
of
sympathy
and
interest
must
always
remember
this
that
you
have
something
more
important
to
attend
to
than
merely
looking
out
for
a
beautiful
sweetheart
that
is
the
fancy
of
a
foolish
girl
you
have
your
profession
and
you
must
become
great
and
famous
in
that
and
then
some
day
when
you
meet
this
beautiful
woman
and
ask
her
to
be
your
wife
she
will
be
bound
to
do
that
and
you
will
confer
honor
on
her
as
well
as
secure
happiness
to
yourself
now
if
you
were
to
fall
in
love
with
some
coquettish
girl
like
her
you
were
singing
about
you
would
have
no
more
ambition
to
become
famous
you
would
lose
all
interest
in
everything
except
her
and
she
would
be
able
to
make
you
miserable
by
a
single
word
when
you
have
made
a
name
for
yourself
and
got
a
good
many
more
years
you
will
be
better
able
to
bear
anything
that
happens
to
you
in
your
love
or
in
your
are
very
kind
to
take
so
much
trouble
said
young
mosenberg
looking
up
with
big
grateful
eyes
madame
if
you
are
not
very
busy
during
the
day
you
will
let
me
call
in
sometimes
and
if
there
is
no
one
here
i
will
tell
you
about
what
i
am
doing
and
play
for
you
or
sing
for
you
if
you
the
afternoons
i
am
always
free
she
said
you
never
go
out
he
asked
often
my
husband
is
at
his
studio
most
of
the
the
boy
looked
at
her
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
said
with
a
sudden
rush
of
color
to
his
face
should
not
stay
so
much
in
the
house
will
you
sometimes
go
for
a
little
walk
with
me
madame
to
kensington
gardens
if
you
are
not
busy
in
the
afternoon
certainly
said
sheila
without
a
embarrassment
you
live
near
them
i
live
in
sloane
street
but
the
underground
railways
brings
me
here
in
a
very
short
that
mention
of
sloane
street
gave
a
twinge
to
heart
ought
she
have
been
so
ready
to
accept
offers
of
new
friendship
just
as
her
old
friend
had
been
banished
from
her
sloane
street
do
you
know
ingram
yes
very
well
do
you
is
one
of
my
oldest
friends
said
sheila
bravely
she
would
not
acknowledge
that
their
intimacy
was
a
thing
of
the
past
is
a
very
good
friend
to
me
i
know
that
said
young
mosenberg
with
a
laugh
hired
a
piano
merely
because
i
used
to
go
into
his
rooms
at
night
and
now
he
makes
me
play
over
my
most
difficult
music
when
i
go
in
and
he
sits
and
smokes
a
pipe
and
pretends
to
like
it
i
do
not
think
he
does
but
i
have
got
to
do
it
all
the
same
and
then
afterward
i
sing
for
him
songs
that
i
know
he
likes
madame
i
think
i
can
surprise
he
went
to
the
piano
and
began
to
sing
in
a
very
quiet
way
oh
soft
be
thy
slumbers
by
waters
thy
was
sung
by
fair
daughters
but
far
in
lochaber
the
true
heart
was
weeping
whose
hopes
are
entombed
in
the
grave
where
sleeping
it
was
the
lament
of
the
young
girl
whose
lover
had
been
separated
from
her
by
false
reports
and
who
died
before
he
could
get
back
to
lochaber
when
the
deception
was
discovered
and
the
wild
sad
air
the
girl
is
supposed
to
sing
seemed
so
strange
with
those
new
chords
that
this
gave
it
that
sheila
sat
down
and
listened
to
it
as
though
it
were
the
sound
of
the
seas
about
borva
coming
to
her
with
a
new
voice
and
finding
her
altered
and
a
stranger
know
nearly
all
of
those
highland
songs
that
ingram
has
got
said
the
lad
did
not
know
that
he
had
any
sheila
said
he
tries
to
sing
one
himself
said
the
boy
with
a
smile
he
does
not
sing
very
well
and
he
gets
vexed
with
himself
in
fun
and
flings
things
about
the
room
but
you
will
sing
some
of
these
songs
madame
and
let
me
hear
how
they
are
sung
in
the
north
time
said
sheila
would
rather
listen
just
now
to
all
you
can
tell
me
of
ingram
he
is
such
a
very
old
friend
of
mine
and
i
do
not
know
how
he
the
lad
speedily
discovered
that
there
was
at
least
one
way
of
keeping
his
new
and
beautiful
friend
profoundly
interested
and
indeed
he
went
on
talking
until
lavender
came
into
the
room
in
evening
dress
it
was
eleven
and
young
mosenberg
started
up
with
a
thousand
apologies
and
hopes
that
he
had
not
detained
mrs
lavender
no
mrs
lavender
was
not
going
out
her
husband
was
going
around
for
an
hour
to
a
ball
that
kavanagh
was
giving
but
she
preferred
to
stay
at
home
i
call
upon
you
afternoon
madame
said
the
boy
as
he
was
leaving
shall
be
very
glad
if
you
will
sheila
answered
and
as
he
went
along
the
pavement
young
mosenberg
observed
to
his
companion
that
mrs
lavender
did
not
seem
to
have
gone
out
much
and
that
it
was
very
good
of
her
to
have
promised
to
go
with
him
occasionally
into
kensington
gardens
has
she
said
lavender
said
the
lad
with
some
surprise
are
lucky
to
be
able
to
get
her
to
leave
the
house
her
husband
said
perhaps
he
had
not
tried
so
much
as
the
words
seemed
to
imply
chapter
xvii
guesses
ingram
cried
young
mosenberg
bursting
into
the
room
of
his
friend
you
know
that
i
have
seen
your
princess
from
the
island
of
the
atlantic
yes
i
met
her
yesterday
and
i
went
up
to
the
house
and
i
dined
there
and
spent
all
the
evening
ingram
was
not
surprised
nor
apparently
much
interested
he
was
cutting
open
the
leaves
of
a
quarterly
review
and
a
pipe
lay
on
the
table
beside
him
a
fire
had
been
lit
for
the
evenings
were
getting
chill
occasionally
the
shutters
were
shut
there
was
some
whiskey
on
the
table
so
that
this
small
apartment
seemed
to
have
its
share
of
comforts
said
ingram
quietly
you
play
for
her
sing
for
her
too
you
play
and
sing
your
very
best
for
her
i
did
but
i
have
not
told
you
half
yet
this
afternoon
i
went
up
and
she
went
out
for
a
walk
with
me
and
we
went
down
through
kensington
gardens
and
all
around
by
the
serpentine
she
go
into
that
parade
of
people
said
ingram
looking
up
with
some
surprise
said
the
lad
looking
rather
crestfallen
for
he
would
have
liked
to
show
off
sheila
to
some
of
his
friends
would
not
go
she
preferred
to
watch
the
small
boats
on
the
serpentine
and
she
was
very
kind
too
in
speaking
to
the
children
and
helping
them
with
their
boats
although
some
people
stared
at
her
and
what
is
more
than
all
these
things
night
she
comes
with
me
to
a
concert
in
the
hall
are
very
fortunate
said
ingram
with
a
smile
for
he
was
well
pleased
to
hear
that
sheila
had
taken
a
fancy
to
the
boy
and
was
likely
to
find
his
society
amusing
you
have
not
told
me
yet
what
you
think
of
i
think
of
her
said
the
lad
pausing
in
a
bewildered
way
as
if
he
could
find
no
words
to
express
his
opinion
of
sheila
and
then
he
said
suddenly
think
she
is
like
the
mother
of
irreverent
young
rascal
said
ingram
lighting
his
pipe
dare
you
say
such
a
thing
mean
in
the
pictures
in
the
tall
pictures
you
see
in
some
churches
abroad
far
up
in
a
half
darkness
she
has
the
same
sweet
compassionate
look
and
her
eyes
are
sometimes
a
little
sad
and
when
she
speaks
to
you
you
think
you
have
known
her
for
a
long
time
and
that
she
wishes
to
be
very
kind
to
you
but
she
is
not
a
princess
at
all
as
you
told
me
i
expected
to
find
her
a
grand
haughty
willful
yes
but
she
is
much
too
friendly
for
that
and
when
she
laughs
you
see
she
could
not
sweep
about
a
room
and
stare
at
people
but
if
she
was
angry
or
proud
perhaps
then
you
make
her
angry
then
said
ingram
go
and
play
over
all
you
were
practicing
in
the
morning
no
stop
a
bit
sit
down
and
tell
me
something
more
about
your
experiences
of
shei
of
young
mosenberg
laughed
and
sat
down
you
know
ingram
that
the
same
thing
occurred
the
night
before
last
i
was
about
to
sing
some
more
or
i
was
asking
mrs
lavender
to
sing
some
more
i
forget
which
but
she
said
to
me
just
now
i
wish
you
to
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
you
know
about
she
no
sooner
honors
you
with
her
confidence
than
you
carry
it
to
every
one
said
ingram
somewhat
fearful
of
the
tongue
as
to
that
said
the
lad
delighted
to
see
that
his
friend
was
a
little
embarrassed
to
that
i
believe
she
is
in
love
with
said
ingram
with
a
flash
of
anger
in
the
dark
eyes
you
were
half
a
dozen
years
older
i
would
thrash
the
life
out
of
you
do
you
think
that
is
a
pretty
sort
of
joke
to
make
about
a
woman
you
know
the
mischief
your
gabbling
tongue
might
make
for
how
is
every
one
to
know
that
you
are
talking
merely
impertinent
nonsense
said
the
boy
audaciously
did
not
mean
anything
of
the
kind
you
see
in
comedies
or
in
operas
breaking
up
marriages
and
causing
duels
oh
no
i
think
she
is
in
love
with
you
as
i
am
in
love
with
her
and
i
am
ever
since
i
will
say
this
for
you
remarked
ingram
slowly
you
are
the
cheekiest
young
beggar
i
have
the
pleasure
to
know
you
are
in
love
with
her
are
you
a
lady
admits
you
to
her
house
is
particularly
kind
to
you
talks
to
you
in
confidence
and
then
you
go
and
tell
people
you
are
in
love
with
her
did
not
tell
people
said
mosenberg
flushing
under
the
severity
of
the
reproof
told
you
only
and
i
thought
you
would
understand
what
i
meant
i
should
have
told
lavender
himself
just
as
soon
yes
only
he
would
not
do
you
know
said
the
boy
impatiently
can
not
one
see
it
you
have
a
pretty
wife
much
prettier
than
any
one
you
would
see
at
a
ball
at
and
you
leave
her
at
home
and
you
go
to
the
ball
to
amuse
this
boy
ingram
perceived
was
getting
to
see
too
clearly
how
matters
stood
he
bade
him
go
and
play
some
music
having
first
admonished
him
gravely
about
the
necessity
of
keeping
some
watch
and
ward
over
his
tongue
then
the
pipe
was
and
a
fury
of
sound
arose
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
so
lavender
forgetful
of
the
girl
who
loved
him
forgetful
of
his
own
generous
instincts
forgetful
of
the
future
that
his
fine
abilities
promised
was
still
dangling
after
this
alien
woman
and
sheila
was
left
at
home
with
her
troubles
and
piteous
yearnings
and
fancies
as
her
only
companions
once
upon
a
time
ingram
could
have
gone
straight
up
to
him
and
admonished
him
and
driven
him
to
mend
his
ways
but
now
that
was
impossible
what
was
still
possible
one
wild
project
occurred
to
him
for
a
moment
but
he
laughed
at
it
and
dismissed
it
it
was
that
he
should
go
boldly
to
lorraine
herself
ask
her
plainly
if
she
knew
what
cruel
injury
she
was
doing
to
this
young
wife
and
force
her
to
turn
lavender
adrift
but
what
enterprise
of
the
days
of
old
romance
could
be
compared
with
this
mad
proposal
to
ride
up
to
a
castle
blow
a
trumpet
and
announce
that
unless
a
certain
lady
were
released
forthwith
death
and
destruction
would
begin
all
that
was
simple
enough
easy
and
according
to
rule
but
to
go
into
a
without
an
introduction
and
request
her
to
stop
a
certain
flirtation
that
was
a
much
more
awful
undertaking
but
ingram
could
not
altogether
dismiss
this
notion
from
his
head
mosenberg
went
on
playing
no
longer
his
but
all
manner
of
airs
which
he
knew
ingram
liked
while
the
small
sallow
man
with
the
brown
beard
lay
in
his
and
smoked
his
pipe
and
gazed
attentively
at
his
toes
on
the
fender
know
kavanagh
and
her
daughter
you
mosenberg
he
said
during
an
interval
in
the
music
much
said
the
boy
were
in
england
only
a
little
while
before
i
went
to
should
like
to
know
is
very
easy
mr
lavender
will
introduce
you
to
them
mrs
lavender
said
he
went
there
very
would
they
do
do
you
think
if
i
went
up
and
asked
to
see
them
servant
would
ask
if
it
was
about
beer
or
coals
that
you
a
man
will
do
much
for
a
woman
who
is
his
friend
but
to
be
suspected
of
being
a
traveler
to
have
to
push
way
into
a
strange
to
have
to
confront
the
awful
stare
of
the
inmates
and
then
to
have
to
deliver
a
message
which
they
will
probably
consider
as
the
very
extreme
of
audacious
and
meddling
impertinence
the
prospect
was
not
pleasant
and
yet
ingram
as
he
sat
and
thought
over
it
that
evening
finally
resolved
to
encounter
all
these
dangers
and
wounds
he
could
help
sheila
in
no
other
way
he
was
banished
from
her
house
perhaps
he
might
induce
this
american
girl
to
release
her
captive
and
give
lavender
back
to
his
own
wife
what
were
a
few
twinges
of
or
risks
of
a
humiliating
failure
compared
with
the
possibility
of
befriending
sheila
in
some
small
way
next
morning
he
went
early
into
whitehall
and
about
one
in
the
forenoon
started
off
for
holland
park
he
wore
a
tall
hat
a
black
and
yellow
kid
gloves
he
went
in
a
hansom
so
that
the
person
who
opened
the
door
should
know
that
he
was
not
a
traveler
in
this
wise
he
reached
house
which
lavender
had
frequently
pointed
out
to
him
in
passing
about
one
and
with
some
internal
tremors
but
much
outward
calmness
went
up
the
broad
stone
steps
a
small
boy
in
buttons
opened
the
door
lorraine
at
home
sir
answered
the
boy
it
was
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
in
a
few
seconds
he
found
himself
in
a
big
and
the
youth
had
taken
his
card
ingram
was
not
very
sure
whether
his
success
so
far
was
due
to
the
hansom
or
to
his
tall
hat
or
to
a
cane
which
his
grandfather
had
brought
home
from
india
however
here
he
was
in
the
house
just
like
the
hero
of
one
of
those
fine
old
farces
of
our
youth
who
jumps
from
the
street
into
a
strange
flirts
with
the
maid
hides
behind
a
screen
confronts
the
master
and
marries
his
daughter
all
in
half
an
hour
the
most
exacting
unities
of
time
and
place
being
faithfully
observed
presently
the
door
was
opened
and
a
young
lady
pale
and
calm
and
sweet
of
face
approached
him
and
not
only
bowed
to
him
but
held
out
her
hand
have
much
pleasure
in
making
your
acquaintance
ingram
she
said
gently
and
somewhat
slowly
lavender
has
frequently
promised
to
bring
you
to
see
us
for
he
has
spoken
to
us
so
much
about
you
that
we
begun
to
think
we
already
knew
you
will
you
come
with
me
up
stairs
that
i
may
introduce
you
to
mamma
ingram
had
come
prepared
to
state
harsh
truths
bluntly
and
was
ready
to
meet
any
sort
of
anger
or
opposition
with
a
perfect
frankness
of
intention
but
he
certainly
had
not
come
prepared
to
find
the
and
fascinating
american
widow
of
whom
he
had
heard
so
much
a
quiet
self
possessed
and
gracious
young
lady
of
singularly
winning
manners
and
clear
and
resolutely
honest
eyes
had
lavender
been
quite
accurate
or
even
conscientious
in
his
garrulous
talk
about
lorraine
you
will
excuse
me
said
ingram
with
a
smile
that
had
less
of
embarrassment
about
it
than
he
could
have
expected
would
rather
speak
to
you
for
a
few
minutes
first
the
fact
is
i
have
come
on
a
errand
and
that
must
be
my
apology
for
for
thrusting
myself
am
sure
no
apology
is
needed
said
the
girl
have
always
been
expecting
to
see
you
will
you
sit
down
he
put
his
hat
and
his
cane
on
the
table
and
as
he
did
so
he
recorded
a
mental
resolution
not
to
be
led
away
by
the
apparent
innocence
and
sweetness
of
this
woman
what
a
fool
he
had
been
to
expect
her
to
appear
in
the
guise
of
some
forward
and
giggling
coquette
as
if
frank
lavender
with
all
his
faults
could
have
suffered
anything
like
coarseness
of
manners
but
was
this
woman
any
the
less
dangerous
that
she
was
refined
and
courteous
and
had
the
speech
and
bearing
of
a
gentlewoman
lorraine
he
said
lowering
his
eyebrows
somewhat
may
as
well
be
frank
with
you
i
have
come
upon
an
unpleasant
errand
an
affair
indeed
which
ought
to
be
no
business
of
mine
but
sometimes
when
you
care
a
little
for
some
one
you
mind
running
the
risk
of
being
treated
as
an
intermeddler
you
know
that
i
know
mrs
lavender
she
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
she
was
almost
a
child
when
i
knew
her
first
and
i
still
have
a
sort
of
notion
that
she
is
a
child
and
that
i
should
look
after
her
and
so
and
so
she
sat
quite
still
there
was
no
surprise
no
alarm
no
anger
when
name
was
mentioned
she
was
merely
attentive
but
now
seeing
that
he
hesitated
she
said
do
not
know
what
you
have
to
say
but
if
it
is
serious
may
not
i
ask
mamma
to
join
us
you
please
no
i
would
rather
speak
with
you
alone
as
this
matter
concerns
yourself
only
well
the
fact
is
i
have
seen
for
some
time
back
that
mrs
lavender
is
very
unhappy
she
is
left
alone
she
knows
no
one
in
london
perhaps
she
does
not
care
to
join
much
in
those
social
amusements
that
her
husband
enjoys
i
say
this
poor
girl
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
i
can
not
help
trying
to
do
something
to
make
her
less
wretched
and
so
i
have
ventured
to
come
to
you
to
see
if
you
could
assist
me
mr
lavender
comes
very
much
to
your
house
and
sheila
is
left
all
by
herself
and
doubtless
she
begins
to
fancy
that
her
husband
is
neglectful
perhaps
indifferent
to
her
and
may
get
to
imagine
things
that
are
quite
wrong
you
know
and
that
could
be
explained
away
by
a
little
kindness
on
your
was
this
then
the
fashion
in
which
jonah
had
gone
up
to
curse
the
wickedness
of
nineveh
as
he
had
spoken
he
had
been
aware
that
those
sincere
somewhat
and
far
from
unfriendly
eyes
that
were
fixed
on
him
had
undergone
no
change
whatever
here
was
no
vile
creature
who
would
start
up
with
a
guilty
conscience
to
repel
the
remotest
hint
of
an
accusation
and
indeed
quite
unconsciously
to
himself
he
had
been
led
on
to
ask
for
her
help
not
that
he
feared
her
not
but
that
he
could
have
said
the
harshest
things
to
her
which
there
was
any
reason
for
saying
but
somehow
there
seemed
to
be
no
occasion
for
the
utterance
of
any
cruel
truths
the
wonder
of
it
was
too
that
instead
of
being
wounded
indignant
and
angry
as
he
had
expected
her
to
be
she
betrayed
a
very
friendly
interest
in
sheila
as
though
she
herself
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
matter
have
undertaken
a
very
difficult
task
ingram
she
said
with
a
smile
think
there
are
many
married
ladies
in
london
who
have
a
friend
who
would
do
as
much
for
them
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
both
my
mamma
and
myself
have
come
to
the
same
conclusion
as
yourself
about
mr
lavender
it
is
really
too
bad
the
way
in
which
he
allows
that
pretty
young
thing
to
remain
at
home
for
i
suppose
she
would
go
more
into
society
if
he
were
to
coax
her
and
persuade
her
we
have
done
what
we
could
in
sending
her
invitations
in
calling
on
her
and
in
begging
mr
lavender
to
bring
her
with
him
but
he
has
always
some
excuse
for
her
so
that
we
never
see
her
and
yet
i
am
sure
he
does
not
mean
to
give
her
pain
for
he
is
very
proud
of
her
and
madly
extravagant
wherever
she
is
concerned
and
sometimes
he
takes
sudden
fits
of
trying
to
please
her
and
be
kind
to
her
that
are
quite
odd
in
their
way
can
you
tell
me
what
we
should
do
ingram
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
and
said
gravely
and
slowly
we
talk
anymore
about
that
i
must
clear
my
conscience
i
perceive
that
i
have
done
you
a
wrong
i
came
here
prepared
to
accuse
you
of
drawing
away
mr
lavender
from
his
wife
of
seeking
amusement
and
perhaps
some
social
distinction
by
keeping
him
continually
dangling
after
you
and
i
meant
to
reproach
you
or
even
threaten
you
until
you
promised
never
to
see
him
a
quick
flush
partly
of
shame
partly
of
annoyance
sprang
to
fair
and
pale
face
but
she
answered
calmly
is
perhaps
as
well
that
you
did
not
tell
me
this
a
few
minutes
ago
may
i
ask
what
has
led
you
to
change
your
opinion
of
me
if
it
has
changed
course
it
has
changed
he
said
promptly
and
emphatically
can
see
that
i
did
you
a
great
injury
and
i
apologize
for
it
and
beg
your
forgiveness
but
when
you
ask
me
what
has
led
me
to
change
my
opinion
what
am
i
to
say
your
manner
perhaps
more
than
what
you
have
said
has
convinced
me
that
i
was
you
are
again
mistaken
she
said
coldly
get
rapidly
to
reproof
is
just
he
said
are
quite
right
i
have
made
a
blunder
there
is
no
mistake
about
do
you
think
it
was
fair
she
said
with
some
spirit
you
think
it
was
fair
to
believe
all
this
harm
about
a
woman
you
had
never
seen
now
listen
a
hundred
times
i
have
begged
mr
lavender
to
be
more
attentive
to
his
wife
not
in
these
words
of
course
but
as
directly
as
i
could
mamma
has
given
parties
made
arrangements
for
visits
drives
and
all
sorts
of
things
to
tempt
mrs
lavender
to
come
to
us
and
all
in
vain
of
course
you
thrust
yourself
on
any
one
like
that
though
mamma
and
myself
like
mrs
lavender
very
well
it
is
asking
too
much
that
we
should
encounter
the
humiliation
of
here
she
stopped
suddenly
with
the
least
show
of
embarrassment
then
she
said
frankly
are
an
old
friend
of
hers
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
have
risked
so
much
for
the
sake
of
that
girl
there
are
very
few
gentlemen
whom
one
meets
who
would
do
as
ingram
could
say
nothing
and
was
a
little
impatient
with
himself
was
he
to
be
first
reproved
and
then
treated
with
an
indulgent
kindness
by
a
mere
girl
said
lorraine
as
an
elderly
lady
entered
the
room
me
introduce
you
to
ingram
whom
you
must
already
know
he
proposes
we
should
join
in
some
conspiracy
to
inveigle
mrs
lavender
into
society
and
make
the
poor
little
thing
amuse
said
kavanagh
with
a
smile
is
a
good
deal
taller
than
you
are
my
dear
but
i
am
afraid
ingram
you
have
undertaken
a
hopeless
task
will
you
stay
to
luncheon
and
talk
it
over
with
us
hope
you
will
said
lorraine
and
naturally
enough
he
consented
luncheon
was
just
ready
as
they
were
going
into
the
room
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hall
the
younger
lady
said
to
ingram
in
a
quiet
undertone
but
with
much
indifference
of
manner
know
if
you
think
i
ought
to
give
up
acquaintance
altogether
i
will
do
so
at
once
but
perhaps
that
will
not
be
so
this
was
the
house
in
which
husband
spent
so
much
of
his
time
and
these
were
the
two
ladies
of
whom
so
much
had
been
said
and
surmised
there
were
three
of
pictures
on
the
walls
of
the
and
as
ingram
inadvertently
glanced
at
them
lorraine
said
to
him
you
think
it
is
a
pity
mr
lavender
should
continue
drawing
those
imaginative
sketches
of
heads
i
do
not
think
myself
that
he
does
himself
justice
in
that
way
some
bits
of
landscape
now
that
i
have
seen
seemed
to
me
to
have
quite
a
definite
character
about
them
and
promised
far
more
than
anything
else
of
his
i
have
is
precisely
what
i
think
said
ingram
partly
amused
and
partly
annoyed
to
find
that
this
girl
with
her
clear
gray
eyes
her
soft
and
musical
voice
and
her
singular
delicacy
of
manner
had
an
evil
trick
of
saying
the
very
things
he
would
himself
have
said
and
leaving
him
with
nothing
but
a
helpless
think
he
ought
to
have
given
up
his
club
when
he
married
most
english
gentlemen
do
that
when
they
marry
do
they
not
said
kavanagh
said
ingram
a
good
deal
of
nonsense
is
talked
about
the
influence
of
clubs
in
that
way
it
is
really
absurd
to
suppose
that
the
size
or
the
shape
of
a
building
can
alter
a
moral
does
though
said
lorraine
confidently
can
tell
directly
if
a
gentleman
has
been
accustomed
to
spend
his
time
in
clubs
when
he
is
surprised
or
angry
or
impatient
you
can
perceive
blanks
in
his
conversation
which
in
a
club
i
suppose
would
be
filled
up
you
know
poor
old
colonel
way
of
talking
mamma
this
old
gentleman
ingram
is
very
fond
of
speaking
to
you
about
political
liberty
and
the
rights
of
conscience
and
he
generally
becomes
so
confused
that
he
gets
vexed
with
himself
and
makes
odd
pauses
as
if
he
were
invariably
addressing
himself
in
very
rude
language
indeed
sometimes
you
would
think
he
was
like
a
railway
engine
going
blindly
and
helplessly
on
through
a
thick
and
choking
mist
and
you
can
see
that
if
there
were
no
ladies
present
he
would
let
off
a
few
crackers
as
it
were
just
to
bring
himself
up
a
bit
and
let
people
know
where
he
was
then
he
will
go
on
again
talking
away
until
you
fancy
yourself
in
a
tunnel
with
a
throbbing
noise
in
your
ears
and
all
the
daylight
shut
out
and
you
perhaps
getting
to
wish
that
on
the
whole
you
were
beg
your
pardon
mamma
said
the
younger
lady
with
a
quiet
smile
look
so
surprised
that
ingram
will
give
me
credit
for
not
often
erring
in
that
way
you
look
as
though
a
hare
had
turned
and
attacked
would
give
most
people
a
fright
said
ingram
with
a
laugh
he
was
rapidly
forgetting
the
object
of
his
mission
the
almost
childish
softness
of
voice
of
this
girl
and
the
perfect
composure
with
which
she
uttered
little
sayings
that
showed
considerable
sharpness
of
observation
and
a
keen
enjoyment
of
the
grotesque
had
an
odd
sort
of
fascination
for
him
he
totally
forgot
that
lavender
had
been
fascinated
by
it
too
if
he
had
been
reminded
of
the
fact
at
this
moment
he
would
have
said
that
the
boy
had
as
usual
got
sentimental
about
a
pretty
pair
of
big
gray
eyes
and
a
fine
profile
while
he
ingram
was
possessed
by
nothing
but
a
purely
intellectual
admiration
of
certain
fine
qualities
of
wit
sincerity
of
speech
and
womanly
shrewdness
luncheon
indeed
was
over
before
any
mention
was
made
of
the
lavenders
and
when
they
returned
to
that
subject
it
appeared
to
ingram
that
their
relations
had
in
the
meantime
got
to
be
very
friendly
and
that
they
were
really
discussing
this
matter
as
if
they
formed
a
little
family
conclave
have
told
ingram
mamma
lorraine
said
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
will
do
whatever
he
thinks
i
ought
to
do
mr
lavender
has
been
a
friend
of
ours
for
some
time
and
of
course
he
can
not
be
treated
with
rudeness
or
incivility
but
if
we
are
wounding
the
feelings
of
any
one
by
asking
him
to
come
here
and
he
certainly
visited
us
pretty
often
why
it
would
be
easy
to
lessen
the
number
of
his
calls
is
that
what
we
should
do
ingram
you
would
not
have
us
quarrel
with
him
said
kavanagh
with
a
smile
there
is
no
certainty
he
will
spend
more
of
his
time
with
his
wife
merely
because
he
spends
less
of
it
here
and
yet
i
fancy
he
is
a
very
very
said
ingram
with
decision
have
known
him
for
years
and
i
know
that
he
is
exceedingly
unselfish
and
that
he
would
do
a
ridiculously
generous
thing
to
serve
a
friend
and
that
a
fellow
does
not
breathe
in
the
world
but
he
is
at
times
i
admit
very
thoughtless
and
sort
of
said
lorraine
in
her
gentlest
voice
very
good
in
its
way
but
rather
uncertain
so
long
as
it
shines
in
one
direction
it
is
all
right
and
quite
trustworthy
for
you
want
a
hard
brush
to
brush
sunlight
off
a
wall
but
when
the
sunlight
shifts
you
know
wall
is
left
in
the
cold
well
said
ingram
am
afraid
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
dictate
to
you
what
you
ought
to
do
i
do
not
wish
to
draw
you
into
any
interference
between
husband
and
wife
or
even
to
let
mr
lavender
know
that
you
think
he
is
not
treating
shei
mrs
lavender
properly
but
if
you
were
to
hint
to
him
that
he
ought
to
pay
some
attention
to
her
that
he
should
not
be
going
everywhere
as
if
he
were
a
young
bachelor
in
chambers
if
you
would
discourage
his
coming
to
see
you
without
bringing
her
also
and
so
forth
surely
he
would
see
what
you
mean
perhaps
i
ask
too
much
of
you
but
i
had
intended
to
ask
more
the
fact
is
kavanagh
i
had
done
your
daughter
the
injustice
of
supposing
thought
we
had
agreed
to
say
no
more
about
that
said
lorraine
quickly
and
ingram
was
silent
half
an
hour
thereafter
he
was
walking
back
though
holland
park
through
the
warm
light
of
an
autumn
afternoon
the
place
seemed
much
changed
since
he
had
seen
it
a
couple
of
hours
before
the
double
curve
of
big
houses
had
a
more
friendly
and
hospitable
look
the
very
air
seemed
to
be
more
genial
and
comfortable
since
he
had
driven
up
here
in
the
hansom
perhaps
ingram
was
at
this
moment
a
little
more
perturbed
pleased
and
bewildered
than
he
would
have
liked
to
confess
he
had
discovered
a
great
deal
in
these
two
hours
been
much
surprised
and
fascinated
and
had
come
away
fairly
stupefied
with
the
result
of
his
mission
he
had
indeed
been
successful
lavender
would
now
find
a
different
welcome
awaiting
him
in
the
house
in
which
he
had
been
spending
nearly
all
his
time
to
the
neglect
of
his
wife
but
the
fact
is
that
as
edward
ingram
went
rapidly
over
in
his
own
mind
everything
that
had
occurred
since
his
entrance
into
that
house
as
he
anxiously
recalled
the
remarks
made
to
him
the
tone
and
looks
accompanying
them
and
his
own
replies
it
was
not
of
affairs
alone
that
he
thought
he
confessed
to
himself
frankly
that
he
had
never
yet
met
any
woman
who
had
so
surprised
him
into
admiration
on
their
first
meeting
yet
what
had
she
said
nothing
very
particular
was
it
the
bright
intelligence
of
the
gray
eyes
that
seemed
to
see
everything
he
meant
with
an
instant
quickness
and
that
seemed
to
agree
with
him
even
before
he
spoke
he
reflected
now
that
he
was
in
the
open
air
that
he
must
have
persecuted
these
two
women
dreadfully
in
getting
away
from
affairs
they
had
touched
on
pictures
books
and
what
not
on
the
young
poet
who
was
playing
alfred
de
musset
in
england
on
the
great
philosopher
who
had
gone
into
the
house
to
confuse
and
bewilder
the
country
gentlemen
there
on
all
sorts
of
topics
indeed
except
those
which
as
ingram
had
anticipated
such
a
creature
as
lorraine
would
naturally
have
found
interesting
and
he
had
to
confess
to
himself
that
he
had
lectured
his
two
helpless
victims
most
unmercifully
he
was
quite
conscious
that
he
sometimes
laid
down
the
law
in
an
authoritative
and
even
sententious
manner
on
first
going
into
the
house
certain
things
said
by
lorraine
had
almost
surprised
him
into
a
mood
of
mere
acquiescence
but
after
luncheon
he
had
assumed
his
ordinary
manner
of
tutor
in
general
to
the
universe
and
had
informed
these
two
women
in
a
distinct
fashion
what
their
opinions
ought
to
be
on
half
the
social
conundrums
of
the
day
he
now
reflected
with
much
compunction
that
this
was
highly
improper
he
ought
to
have
asked
about
and
inquired
whether
the
princess
of
wales
was
looking
well
of
late
some
reference
to
the
late
parisian
comedy
might
have
introduced
a
disquisition
on
the
new
grays
and
greens
of
the
french
milliners
with
a
passing
mention
made
of
the
price
paid
for
a
pair
of
ponies
by
a
certain
marquise
unattached
he
had
not
spoken
of
one
of
these
things
perhaps
he
could
not
if
he
had
tried
he
remembered
with
an
awful
consciousness
of
guilt
that
he
had
actually
discoursed
of
woman
suffrage
of
the
public
conscience
of
new
york
of
the
extirpation
of
the
indians
and
a
dozen
different
things
not
only
taking
no
heed
of
any
opinions
that
his
audience
of
two
might
hold
but
insisting
on
their
accepting
his
opinions
as
the
expression
of
absolute
and
incontrovertible
truth
he
became
more
and
more
dissatisfied
with
himself
if
he
could
only
go
back
now
he
would
be
much
more
wary
more
submissive
and
complaisant
more
anxious
to
please
what
right
had
he
to
abuse
the
courtesy
and
hospitality
of
those
two
strangers
and
lecture
them
on
the
constitution
of
their
own
country
he
was
annoyed
beyond
expression
that
they
had
listened
to
him
with
so
much
patience
and
yet
he
could
not
have
seriously
offended
them
for
they
had
earnestly
besought
him
to
dine
with
them
on
the
following
tuesday
evening
to
meet
an
american
judge
and
when
he
had
consented
lorraine
had
written
down
on
a
card
the
date
and
hour
lest
he
should
forget
he
had
the
card
in
his
pocket
surely
he
could
not
have
offended
them
if
he
had
pursued
this
series
of
questions
he
might
have
gone
on
to
ask
himself
why
he
should
be
so
anxious
not
to
have
offended
these
two
new
friends
he
was
not
ordinarily
very
sensitive
to
the
opinions
that
might
be
formed
of
him
more
especially
by
persons
living
out
of
his
own
sphere
with
whom
he
was
not
likely
to
associate
he
did
not
indeed
as
a
general
rule
suffer
himself
to
be
perturbed
about
anything
and
yet
as
he
went
along
the
busy
thoroughfare
at
this
moment
he
was
conscious
that
rarely
in
his
life
had
he
been
so
ill
at
ease
something
now
occurred
that
startled
him
out
of
his
reverie
communing
with
himself
he
was
staring
blankly
ahead
taking
little
note
of
the
people
whom
he
saw
but
somehow
in
a
vague
and
way
he
seemed
to
become
aware
that
there
was
some
one
in
front
of
him
a
long
way
ahead
as
yet
whom
he
knew
he
was
still
thinking
of
lorraine
and
unconsciously
postponing
the
examination
of
this
approaching
figure
or
rather
pair
of
figures
when
with
a
sudden
start
he
found
sad
and
earnest
eyes
fixed
upon
him
he
woke
up
as
from
a
dream
he
saw
that
young
mosenberg
was
with
her
and
naturally
the
boy
would
have
approached
ingram
and
stopped
and
spoken
but
ingram
paid
no
attention
to
him
he
was
with
a
quick
pang
at
his
heart
regarding
sheila
with
the
knowledge
that
on
her
rested
the
cruel
decision
as
to
whether
she
should
come
forward
or
not
he
was
not
aware
that
her
husband
had
forbidden
her
to
have
any
communication
with
him
yet
he
had
guessed
as
much
partly
from
his
knowledge
of
impatient
disposition
and
partly
from
the
glance
he
caught
of
her
eyes
when
he
woke
up
from
his
trance
young
mosenberg
turned
with
surprise
to
his
companion
she
was
passing
on
he
did
not
even
see
that
she
had
bowed
to
ingram
with
a
face
flushed
with
shame
and
pain
and
with
eyes
cast
down
ingram
too
was
passing
on
without
even
shaking
hands
with
her
or
uttering
a
word
mosenberg
was
too
bewildered
to
attempt
any
protest
he
merely
followed
sheila
with
a
conviction
that
something
desperate
had
occurred
and
that
he
would
best
consult
her
feelings
by
making
no
reference
to
it
but
that
one
look
that
the
girl
had
directed
to
her
old
friend
before
she
bowed
and
passed
on
had
filled
him
with
despair
it
was
somehow
like
the
piteous
look
of
a
wounded
animal
incapable
of
expressing
its
pain
all
thoughts
and
fancies
of
his
own
little
vexations
or
embarrassments
were
instantly
banished
from
him
he
could
only
see
before
him
those
sad
and
piteous
eyes
full
of
kindness
to
him
he
thought
and
of
grief
that
she
should
be
debarred
from
speaking
to
him
and
of
resignation
to
her
own
lot
gwdyr
house
did
not
get
much
work
out
of
him
that
day
he
sat
in
a
small
room
in
a
back
part
of
the
building
looking
out
on
a
lonely
little
square
silent
and
ruddy
with
the
reflected
light
of
the
sunset
hundred
kavanaghs
he
was
thinking
to
himself
bitterly
enough
not
save
my
poor
sheila
she
will
die
of
a
broken
heart
i
can
see
it
in
her
face
and
it
is
i
who
have
done
it
from
first
to
last
it
is
i
who
have
done
it
and
now
i
can
do
nothing
to
help
that
became
the
burden
and
refrain
of
all
his
reflections
it
was
he
who
had
done
this
frightful
thing
it
was
he
who
had
taken
away
the
young
highland
girl
his
good
sheila
from
her
home
and
ruined
her
life
and
broken
her
heart
and
he
could
do
nothing
to
help
her
chapter
xviii
stratagem
met
ingram
said
young
mosenberg
ingeniously
he
was
dining
with
lavender
not
at
home
but
at
a
club
in
street
and
either
his
curiosity
was
too
great
or
he
had
forgotten
altogether
warnings
to
him
that
he
should
hold
his
tongue
did
you
said
lavender
showing
no
great
interest
some
french
mustard
what
did
ingram
say
to
you
the
question
was
asked
with
much
apparent
indifference
and
the
boy
stared
he
said
at
length
suppose
there
is
some
misunderstanding
between
mrs
lavender
and
ingram
for
they
both
saw
each
other
and
they
both
passed
on
without
speaking
i
was
very
sorry
yes
i
thought
they
were
friends
i
thought
ingram
knew
mrs
lavender
even
before
you
did
but
they
did
not
speak
to
each
other
not
one
lavender
was
in
one
sense
pleased
to
hear
this
he
liked
to
hear
that
his
wife
was
obedient
to
him
but
he
said
to
himself
with
a
sharp
twinge
of
conscience
she
was
carrying
her
obedience
too
far
he
had
never
meant
that
she
should
not
even
speak
to
her
old
friend
he
would
talk
to
her
about
it
as
soon
as
he
got
home
and
in
as
kindly
a
way
as
was
possible
mosenberg
did
not
play
billiards
but
they
remained
late
in
the
lavender
playing
pool
and
getting
out
of
it
rather
successfully
he
could
not
speak
to
sheila
that
night
but
next
morning
before
going
out
he
did
he
said
told
me
last
night
that
you
met
ingram
and
did
not
speak
to
him
now
i
mean
anything
like
that
you
must
not
think
me
unreasonable
all
i
want
is
that
he
shall
not
interfere
with
our
affairs
and
try
to
raise
some
unpleasantness
between
you
and
me
such
as
might
arise
from
the
interference
of
even
the
kindest
of
friends
when
you
meet
him
outside
or
at
any
house
i
hope
you
will
treat
him
just
as
sheila
replied
calmly
i
am
not
allowed
to
receive
ingram
here
i
can
not
treat
him
as
a
friend
elsewhere
i
would
rather
not
have
friends
whom
i
can
only
speak
to
in
the
well
said
lavender
wincing
under
the
rebuke
but
fancying
that
she
would
soon
repent
her
of
this
resolve
in
the
meantime
if
she
would
have
it
so
she
would
have
it
so
so
that
was
an
end
of
this
question
of
interference
for
the
present
but
very
soon
in
a
couple
of
days
indeed
lavender
perceived
the
change
that
had
been
wrought
in
the
house
in
holland
park
to
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
resort
kavanagh
had
said
on
leaving
must
not
be
rude
to
she
knew
the
perfect
independence
of
that
gentle
young
lady
and
was
rather
afraid
it
might
carry
her
too
far
course
i
shall
not
be
mamma
lorraine
had
said
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
courageous
act
as
that
man
coming
up
to
two
strangers
and
challenging
them
all
on
account
of
a
girl
married
to
some
one
else
you
know
that
was
the
object
of
his
visit
he
thought
i
was
flirting
with
mr
lavender
and
keeping
him
from
his
wife
i
wonder
how
many
men
there
are
in
london
who
would
have
walked
twenty
yards
to
help
in
such
a
matter
dear
he
may
have
been
in
love
with
that
pretty
young
lady
before
she
was
no
said
the
daughter
quietly
but
quite
confidently
would
not
be
so
ready
to
show
his
interest
in
her
if
that
were
so
either
he
would
be
modest
and
ashamed
of
his
rejection
or
vain
and
attempt
to
make
a
mystery
about
you
are
right
said
the
mother
she
seldom
found
her
daughter
wrong
on
such
points
am
sure
i
am
right
mamma
he
talks
about
her
as
fondly
and
frequently
and
openly
as
a
man
might
talk
about
his
own
daughter
besides
you
can
see
that
he
is
talking
honestly
the
man
deceive
a
child
if
he
were
to
try
you
see
everything
in
his
seem
to
have
been
much
interested
in
him
said
kavanagh
with
no
appearance
of
sarcasm
i
think
i
meet
such
men
often
and
that
is
the
truth
do
you
this
was
carrying
the
war
into
the
country
like
him
very
well
raid
kavanagh
think
he
is
honest
i
do
not
think
he
dresses
very
carefully
and
he
is
perhaps
too
intent
on
convincing
you
that
his
opinions
are
for
my
part
said
her
daughter
with
just
the
least
tinge
of
warmth
in
her
manner
confess
i
like
a
man
who
has
opinions
and
is
not
afraid
to
say
so
i
find
many
who
have
and
for
his
dressing
one
gets
rather
tired
of
men
who
come
to
you
every
evening
to
impress
you
with
the
excellence
of
their
tailor
as
if
women
were
to
be
captured
by
millinery
we
know
the
value
of
linen
and
woolen
fabrics
dear
child
you
are
throwing
away
your
vexation
on
some
one
whom
i
know
it
mr
lavender
dear
no
he
is
not
so
silly
as
that
he
dresses
well
but
there
is
perfect
freedom
about
his
dress
he
is
too
much
of
an
artist
to
sacrifice
himself
to
his
am
glad
you
have
a
good
word
for
him
at
last
i
think
you
have
been
rather
hard
on
him
since
ingram
called
and
that
is
the
reason
i
asked
you
to
be
she
was
quite
careful
but
as
explicit
as
good
manners
would
allow
lorraine
was
most
particular
in
asking
about
mrs
lavender
and
in
expressing
her
regret
that
they
so
seldom
saw
her
has
been
brought
up
in
the
country
you
know
said
lavender
with
a
smile
there
the
daughters
of
a
house
are
taught
a
number
of
domestic
duties
that
they
would
consider
it
a
sin
to
neglect
she
would
be
unhappy
if
you
caused
her
to
neglect
them
she
would
take
her
pleasure
with
a
bad
she
can
not
be
occupied
with
them
all
dear
lorraine
how
often
have
we
discussed
the
question
and
you
know
you
have
me
at
a
disadvantage
for
how
can
i
describe
to
you
what
those
mysterious
duties
are
i
only
know
that
she
is
pretty
nearly
always
busy
with
something
or
other
and
in
the
evening
of
course
she
is
generally
too
tired
to
think
of
going
out
but
you
must
try
to
get
her
out
next
tuesday
now
judge
is
going
to
dine
with
us
and
you
know
how
amusing
he
is
if
you
have
no
other
engagement
you
bring
mrs
lavender
to
dine
with
us
on
that
evening
now
on
former
occasions
something
of
the
same
sort
of
invitation
had
frequently
been
given
and
it
was
generally
answered
by
lavender
giving
an
excuse
for
his
wife
and
promising
to
come
himself
what
was
his
astonishment
to
find
lorraine
plainly
and
most
courteously
intimating
that
the
invitation
was
addressed
distinctly
to
and
mrs
lavender
as
a
couple
when
he
regretted
that
mrs
lavender
could
not
come
she
said
quietly
i
am
so
sorry
you
would
have
met
an
old
friend
of
yours
here
as
well
as
the
judge
lavender
made
no
further
sign
of
surprise
or
curiosity
than
to
lift
his
eyebrows
and
say
but
when
he
left
the
house
certain
dark
suspicions
were
troubling
his
mind
nothing
had
been
said
as
to
the
manner
in
which
ingram
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
kavanagh
and
her
daughter
but
there
was
that
in
manner
which
convinced
lavender
that
something
had
happened
had
ingram
carried
his
interference
to
the
extent
of
complaining
to
them
had
he
overcome
a
repugnance
which
he
had
repeatedly
admitted
and
thrust
himself
upon
these
two
people
for
this
very
purpose
of
making
him
lavender
odious
and
contemptible
cheeks
burned
as
he
thought
of
this
possibility
lorraine
had
been
most
courteous
to
him
but
the
longer
he
dwelt
on
these
vague
surmises
the
deeper
grew
his
consciousness
that
he
had
been
turned
out
of
the
place
morally
if
not
physically
what
was
that
excess
of
courtesy
but
a
cloak
if
she
had
meant
less
she
would
have
been
more
careless
and
all
through
the
interview
he
had
remarked
that
instead
of
the
free
warfare
of
talk
that
generally
went
on
between
them
lorraine
was
most
formally
polite
and
apparently
watchful
of
her
words
he
went
home
in
a
passion
which
was
all
the
more
consuming
that
it
could
not
be
vented
on
any
one
as
sheila
had
not
spoken
to
ingram
as
she
had
even
nerved
herself
to
wound
him
by
passing
him
without
notice
in
the
street
she
could
not
be
held
responsible
and
yet
he
wished
that
he
could
have
upbraided
some
one
for
this
mischief
that
had
been
done
should
he
go
straight
down
to
lodgings
and
have
it
out
with
him
at
first
he
was
strongly
inclined
to
do
so
but
wiser
counsels
prevailed
ingram
had
a
keen
and
ready
tongue
and
a
way
of
saying
things
that
made
them
rankle
afterward
in
the
memory
besides
he
would
go
into
court
with
a
defective
case
he
could
say
nothing
unless
ingram
admitted
that
he
had
tried
to
poison
the
mind
of
lorraine
against
him
and
of
course
if
there
was
a
quarrel
who
would
be
so
foolish
as
to
make
such
an
admission
ingram
would
laugh
at
him
would
refuse
to
admit
or
deny
would
increase
his
anger
without
affording
him
an
opportunity
of
revenging
himself
sheila
could
see
that
her
husband
was
troubled
but
could
not
divine
the
cause
and
had
long
ago
given
up
any
habit
of
inquiry
he
ate
his
dinner
almost
in
silence
and
then
said
he
had
to
make
a
call
on
a
friend
and
that
he
would
perhaps
drop
in
to
the
club
on
his
way
home
so
that
she
was
not
to
sit
up
for
him
she
was
not
surprised
or
hurt
at
the
announcement
she
was
accustomed
to
spend
her
evenings
alone
she
fetched
down
his
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
brought
him
the
coat
then
he
kissed
her
and
went
out
but
this
evening
at
least
she
had
abundant
occupation
and
that
of
a
sufficiently
pleasant
kind
for
some
little
time
she
had
been
harboring
in
her
mind
a
dark
and
mysterious
plot
and
she
was
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
think
it
out
and
arrange
its
details
mairi
was
coming
to
london
and
she
had
carefully
concealed
the
fact
from
her
husband
a
little
surprise
of
a
dramatic
sort
was
to
be
prepared
for
him
with
what
result
who
could
tell
all
of
a
sudden
lavender
was
to
be
precipitated
into
the
island
of
lewis
as
nearly
as
that
could
be
imitated
in
a
house
at
notting
hill
this
was
scheme
and
on
these
lonely
evenings
she
could
sit
by
herself
with
much
satisfaction
and
ponder
over
the
little
points
of
it
and
its
possible
success
mairi
was
coming
to
london
under
the
escort
of
a
worthy
glasgow
fishmonger
whom
mackenzie
knew
she
would
arrive
after
lavender
had
left
for
his
studio
then
she
and
sheila
would
set
to
work
to
transform
the
that
was
sometimes
called
a
library
into
something
resembling
the
quaint
little
in
home
mairi
was
bringing
up
a
quantity
of
heather
gathered
fresh
from
the
rocks
beside
the
white
water
she
was
bringing
up
some
feathers
too
for
the
and
two
or
three
big
shells
and
best
of
all
she
was
to
put
in
her
trunk
a
real
and
veritable
lump
of
peat
well
dried
and
easy
to
light
then
you
must
know
that
sheila
had
already
sketched
out
the
meal
that
was
to
be
placed
on
the
table
so
soon
as
the
room
had
been
done
up
in
highland
fashion
and
this
peat
lit
so
as
to
send
its
fragrant
smoke
abroad
a
large
salmon
was
to
make
its
appearance
first
of
all
there
would
be
bottles
of
beer
on
the
table
also
one
of
those
odd
bottles
of
norwegian
make
filled
with
whisky
and
when
lavender
went
with
wonder
into
the
small
room
when
he
smelt
the
fragrant
peat
smoke
and
every
one
knows
how
powerful
the
sense
of
smell
is
in
recalling
associations
when
he
saw
the
smoking
salmon
and
the
bottled
beer
and
the
whisky
and
when
he
suddenly
found
mairi
coming
into
the
room
and
saying
to
him
in
her
sweet
highland
fashion
are
you
ferry
well
sir
would
not
his
heart
warm
to
the
old
ways
and
kindly
homeliness
of
the
house
in
borva
and
would
not
some
glimpse
of
the
happy
and
time
that
was
now
so
sadly
and
strangely
remote
cause
him
to
break
down
that
barrier
between
himself
and
sheila
that
this
artificial
life
in
the
south
had
placed
there
so
the
child
dreamed
and
was
happy
in
dreaming
of
it
sometimes
she
grew
afraid
of
her
project
she
had
not
had
much
experience
in
deception
and
the
mere
concealment
of
coming
was
a
hard
thing
to
bear
but
surely
her
husband
would
take
this
trick
in
good
part
it
was
only
after
all
a
joke
to
put
a
little
barbaric
splendor
of
decoration
into
the
little
to
have
a
scent
of
in
the
air
and
to
have
a
timid
pretty
highland
girl
suddenly
make
her
appearance
with
an
odor
of
the
sea
about
her
as
it
were
and
a
look
of
fresh
breezes
in
the
color
of
her
cheeks
what
mortal
man
could
find
fault
with
this
innocent
jest
moments
of
doubt
were
succeeded
by
long
hours
of
joyous
confidence
in
which
a
happy
light
shone
on
her
face
she
went
through
the
house
with
a
brisk
step
she
sang
to
herself
as
she
went
she
was
kinder
than
ever
to
the
small
children
who
came
into
the
square
every
forenoon
and
whose
acquaintance
she
had
very
speedily
made
she
gave
each
of
her
threepence
instead
of
twopence
in
passing
the
servants
had
never
seen
her
in
such
good
spirits
she
was
exceptionally
generous
in
presenting
them
with
articles
of
attire
they
might
have
had
half
the
week
in
holidays
if
mr
lavender
had
not
to
be
attended
to
a
small
gentleman
of
three
years
of
age
lived
next
door
and
his
acquaintance
also
she
had
made
by
means
of
his
nurse
at
this
time
his
stock
of
toys
which
sheila
had
kept
carefully
renewed
became
so
big
that
he
might
with
proper
management
have
set
up
a
stall
in
the
lowther
arcade
just
before
she
left
lewis
her
father
had
called
her
to
him
and
said
i
wass
wanting
to
tell
you
about
something
it
is
not
every
one
that
will
care
to
hef
his
money
given
away
to
poor
folk
and
it
wass
many
a
time
i
said
to
myself
that
when
you
were
married
maybe
your
husband
would
think
you
were
giving
too
much
money
to
the
poor
folk
as
you
wass
doing
in
borva
and
it
iss
this
fifty
pounds
i
hef
got
for
you
sheila
in
ten
bank
notes
and
you
will
take
them
with
you
for
your
own
money
that
you
will
not
hef
any
trouble
about
giving
things
to
people
and
when
the
fifty
pounds
will
be
gone
i
will
send
you
another
fifty
pounds
and
it
will
be
no
difference
to
me
whatever
and
if
there
is
any
one
in
borva
you
would
be
for
sending
money
to
there
is
your
own
money
for
there
is
many
a
one
would
take
the
money
from
sheila
mackenzie
that
would
not
be
for
taking
it
from
an
english
stranger
in
london
and
when
you
will
send
it
to
them
you
will
send
it
to
me
and
i
will
tek
it
to
them
and
will
tell
them
that
this
money
is
from
my
sheila
and
from
no
one
else
this
was
all
the
dowry
that
sheila
carried
with
her
to
the
south
mackenzie
would
willingly
have
given
her
half
his
money
if
she
would
have
taken
it
or
if
her
husband
had
desired
it
but
the
old
king
of
borva
had
profound
and
schemes
in
his
head
about
the
small
fortune
he
might
otherwise
have
accorded
to
his
daughter
this
wealth
such
as
it
was
was
to
be
a
magnet
to
draw
this
young
english
gentleman
back
to
the
hebrides
it
was
all
very
well
for
mr
lavender
to
have
plenty
of
money
at
present
he
might
not
always
have
it
then
the
time
would
come
for
mackenzie
to
say
here
young
man
i
can
support
myself
easily
and
comfortably
by
farming
and
fishing
the
money
i
have
is
at
your
disposal
so
long
as
you
consent
to
remain
in
lewis
in
stornoway
if
you
please
elsewhere
if
you
please
only
in
lewis
and
while
you
are
painting
pictures
and
making
as
much
money
as
you
can
that
way
you
can
have
plenty
of
fishing
and
shooting
and
amusement
and
my
guns
and
boats
and
rods
are
all
at
your
mackenzie
considered
that
no
man
could
resist
such
an
offer
sheila
of
course
told
her
husband
of
the
sum
of
money
she
owned
and
for
a
long
time
it
was
a
standing
joke
between
them
he
addressed
her
with
much
respect
and
was
careful
to
inform
her
of
the
fluctuations
of
the
sometimes
he
borrowed
a
sovereign
of
her
and
never
without
giving
her
an
i
o
u
which
was
faithfully
reclaimed
but
by
and
by
she
perceived
that
he
grew
less
and
less
to
like
the
mention
of
this
money
perhaps
it
resembled
too
closely
the
savings
which
the
folks
about
borvapost
would
not
entrust
to
a
bank
but
kept
hid
about
their
huts
in
the
heel
of
a
stocking
at
all
events
sheila
saw
that
her
husband
did
not
like
her
to
go
to
this
fund
for
her
charities
and
so
the
fifty
pounds
that
her
father
had
given
her
had
lasted
a
long
time
during
this
period
of
jubilation
in
which
she
looked
forward
to
touching
her
heart
by
an
innocent
little
strategem
more
frequent
appeals
were
made
to
the
drawer
in
which
the
treasure
was
locked
up
so
that
in
the
end
her
private
dowry
was
reduced
to
thirty
pounds
if
ingram
could
have
but
taken
part
in
this
plan
of
hers
the
only
regret
that
was
mingled
with
her
anticipations
of
a
happier
future
concerned
this
faithful
friend
of
hers
who
seemed
to
have
been
cut
off
from
them
forever
and
it
soon
became
apparent
to
her
that
her
husband
so
far
from
inclining
to
forget
the
misunderstanding
that
had
arisen
between
ingram
and
himself
seemed
to
feel
increased
resentment
insomuch
that
she
was
most
careful
to
avoid
mentioning
his
name
she
was
soon
to
meet
him
however
lavender
was
resolved
that
he
would
not
appear
to
have
retired
from
the
field
merely
because
ingram
had
entered
it
he
would
go
to
this
dinner
on
the
tuesday
evening
and
sheila
would
accompany
him
first
he
asked
her
much
as
she
would
have
preferred
not
visiting
these
particular
people
she
cheerfully
acquiesced
she
was
not
going
to
be
churlish
or
inconsiderate
on
the
very
eve
of
her
dramatic
then
he
went
to
lorraine
and
said
he
had
persuaded
sheila
to
come
with
him
and
the
young
american
lady
and
her
mamma
were
good
enough
to
say
how
glad
they
were
she
had
come
to
this
decision
they
appeared
to
take
it
for
granted
that
it
was
sheila
alone
who
had
declined
former
invitations
ingram
will
be
there
on
tuesday
evening
said
lavender
to
his
wife
was
not
aware
he
knew
them
said
sheila
remembering
indeed
how
scrupulously
ingram
had
refused
to
know
them
has
made
their
acquaintance
for
his
own
purposes
doubtless
said
lavender
suppose
he
will
appear
in
a
with
a
bright
blue
tie
and
he
will
say
to
the
waiters
when
he
does
not
understand
thought
you
said
ingram
belonged
to
a
very
good
family
said
sheila
quietly
is
so
but
each
man
is
responsible
for
his
own
manners
and
as
all
the
society
he
sees
consists
of
a
cat
and
some
wooden
pipes
in
a
couple
of
dingy
rooms
in
sloane
street
you
expect
him
not
to
make
an
ass
of
have
never
seen
him
make
himself
ridiculous
i
do
not
think
it
possible
said
sheila
with
a
certain
precision
of
speech
which
lavender
had
got
to
know
meant
much
that
is
a
matter
for
himself
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
when
i
meet
him
at
course
you
must
meet
him
as
you
would
any
one
else
you
know
if
you
wish
to
speak
to
him
you
need
not
do
so
saying
costs
he
takes
me
into
dinner
she
asked
calmly
you
must
talk
to
him
as
you
would
to
any
stranger
he
said
impatiently
him
if
he
has
been
to
the
opera
and
he
know
there
is
no
opera
going
on
tell
him
that
the
town
is
very
full
and
he
know
that
everybody
has
left
say
you
may
meet
him
again
at
and
see
that
he
know
they
mean
to
start
for
the
tyrol
in
a
fortnight
i
think
you
and
i
must
also
be
settling
soon
where
we
mean
to
go
i
think
we
can
do
better
than
go
to
the
she
did
not
answer
it
was
clear
that
he
had
given
up
all
intention
of
going
up
to
lewis
for
that
year
at
least
but
she
would
not
beg
him
to
alter
his
decision
just
yet
mairi
was
coming
and
that
experiment
of
the
enchanted
room
has
still
to
be
tried
as
they
drove
around
to
house
on
that
tuesday
evening
she
thought
with
much
bitterness
of
heart
of
the
possibility
of
her
having
to
meet
ingram
in
the
fashion
her
husband
had
suggested
would
it
not
be
better
if
he
did
take
her
in
to
dinner
to
throw
herself
entirely
on
his
mercy
and
ask
him
not
to
talk
to
her
at
all
she
would
address
herself
when
there
was
a
chance
to
her
neighbor
on
the
other
side
if
she
remained
silent
altogether
no
great
harm
would
be
done
when
she
went
into
the
her
first
glance
around
was
for
him
and
he
was
the
first
person
whom
she
saw
for
instead
of
withdrawing
into
a
corner
to
make
one
neighbor
the
victim
of
his
shyness
or
concealing
his
embarrassment
in
studying
the
photographic
albums
ingram
was
coolly
standing
on
the
with
both
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
while
he
was
engaged
in
giving
the
american
judge
a
great
deal
of
authoritative
information
about
america
the
judge
was
a
tall
fair
stout
man
fond
of
joking
and
a
good
dinner
and
he
was
content
at
this
moment
to
sit
quietly
in
an
with
a
pleasant
smile
on
his
face
and
be
lectured
about
his
own
country
by
this
sallow
little
man
whom
he
took
to
be
a
professor
of
modern
history
at
some
college
or
other
ingram
as
soon
as
he
found
that
sheila
was
in
the
room
relieved
her
from
any
doubt
as
to
his
intentions
he
merely
came
forward
shook
hands
with
her
and
said
do
you
do
mrs
lavender
and
went
back
to
the
judge
she
might
have
been
an
acquaintance
of
yesterday
or
a
friend
of
twenty
standing
no
one
could
tell
by
his
manner
as
for
sheila
she
parted
with
his
hand
reluctantly
she
tried
to
look
too
what
she
dared
not
say
but
whatever
of
regret
and
kindness
and
assurance
of
friendship
was
in
her
eyes
he
did
not
see
he
scarcely
glanced
at
her
face
he
went
off
at
once
and
plunged
again
into
the
cincinnati
convention
kavanagh
and
lorraine
were
exceedingly
and
almost
obtrusively
kind
to
her
but
she
scarcely
heard
what
they
said
to
her
it
seemed
so
strange
and
so
sad
to
her
that
her
old
friend
should
be
standing
near
her
and
she
so
far
removed
from
him
that
she
dared
not
go
and
speak
to
him
she
could
not
understand
it
sometimes
everything
around
her
seemed
to
get
confused
until
she
felt
as
if
she
were
sinking
in
a
great
sea
and
could
utter
but
one
despairing
cry
as
she
saw
the
light
disappear
above
her
head
when
they
went
in
to
dinner
she
saw
that
seat
was
on
right
hand
and
although
she
could
hear
him
speak
as
he
was
almost
right
opposite
to
her
it
seemed
to
her
that
his
voice
sounded
as
if
it
were
far
away
the
man
who
had
taken
her
in
was
a
tall
and
faultlessly
dressed
person
who
never
spoke
so
that
she
was
allowed
to
sit
and
listen
to
the
conversation
between
lorraine
and
ingram
they
appeared
to
be
on
excellent
terms
you
would
have
fancied
they
had
known
each
other
for
years
and
as
sheila
sat
and
saw
how
and
pleased
with
his
companion
ingram
was
perhaps
now
and
again
the
bitter
question
arose
to
her
mind
whether
this
woman
who
had
taken
away
her
husband
was
seeking
to
take
away
her
friend
also
sheila
knew
nothing
of
all
that
happened
within
these
past
few
days
she
knew
only
that
she
was
alone
without
either
husband
or
friend
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
this
pale
american
girl
had
taken
both
away
from
her
ingram
was
in
one
of
his
happiest
moods
and
was
seeking
to
prove
to
lorraine
that
this
present
ought
to
be
an
especially
pleasant
one
everybody
was
going
away
somewhere
and
of
course
she
must
know
that
the
expectation
of
traveling
was
much
more
delightful
than
the
reality
of
it
what
could
surpass
the
sense
of
freedom
of
power
of
hope
enjoyed
by
the
happy
folks
who
sat
down
to
an
open
atlas
and
began
to
sketch
out
routes
for
their
coming
holidays
where
was
he
going
oh
he
was
going
to
the
north
had
lorraine
never
seen
edinburgh
castle
rising
out
of
a
gray
fog
like
the
ghost
of
some
great
building
belonging
to
the
times
of
arthurian
romance
had
she
never
seen
the
northern
twilights
and
the
awful
gloom
and
wild
colors
of
lock
coruisk
and
the
skye
hills
there
was
no
so
healthy
so
free
from
restraint
as
that
among
the
far
highland
hills
and
glens
where
the
clear
mountain
air
scented
with
miles
and
miles
of
heather
seemed
to
produce
a
sort
of
intoxication
of
good
spirits
within
one
then
the
yachting
around
the
wonderful
islands
of
the
west
the
rapid
runs
of
a
bright
forenoon
the
shooting
of
the
wild
the
scrambled
dinners
in
the
small
cabin
the
still
nights
in
the
small
harbors
with
a
scent
of
aboard
and
the
white
stars
shining
down
on
the
trembling
water
yes
he
was
going
yachting
this
autumn
in
about
a
fortnight
he
hoped
to
start
his
friend
was
at
present
away
up
loch
boisdale
in
south
uist
and
he
did
not
know
how
to
get
there
except
by
going
to
skye
and
taking
his
chance
of
some
boat
going
over
where
would
they
go
then
he
did
not
know
wherever
his
friend
liked
it
would
be
enough
for
him
if
they
kept
always
moving
about
seeing
the
strange
sights
of
the
sea
and
the
air
and
the
lonely
shores
of
those
northern
islands
perhaps
they
might
even
try
to
reach
kilda
ingram
you
go
and
see
my
papa
the
cry
that
suddenly
reached
him
was
like
the
cry
of
a
broken
heart
he
started
as
from
a
trance
and
found
sheila
regarding
him
with
a
piteous
appeal
in
her
face
she
had
been
listening
intently
to
all
he
had
said
yes
sheila
he
said
kindly
and
quite
forgetting
that
he
was
speaking
to
her
before
strangers
course
i
must
go
and
see
your
papa
if
we
are
any
way
near
the
lewis
perhaps
you
may
be
there
then
said
sheila
looking
down
you
go
to
the
highlands
this
autumn
lorraine
asked
in
a
friendly
way
said
sheila
in
a
measured
voice
as
she
looked
her
enemy
fair
in
the
face
think
we
are
going
to
the
if
the
child
had
only
known
what
occurred
to
mind
at
this
moment
not
a
triumphant
sense
of
infatuation
as
sheila
probably
fancied
but
a
very
definite
resolution
that
if
frank
lavender
went
to
the
tyrol
it
was
not
with
either
her
or
her
mother
he
should
go
father
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
said
ingram
loud
enough
for
all
to
hear
hospitable
as
all
highlanders
are
i
have
never
met
his
equal
in
that
way
and
i
have
tried
his
patience
a
good
many
times
what
do
you
think
lorraine
of
a
man
who
would
give
up
his
best
gun
to
you
even
though
you
shoot
a
bit
and
he
particularly
proud
of
his
shooting
and
so
if
you
lived
with
him
for
a
month
or
six
months
each
day
the
best
of
everything
for
you
the
second
best
for
your
friend
the
worst
for
himself
it
so
lavender
it
was
a
direct
challenge
sent
across
the
table
and
heart
beat
quick
lest
her
husband
should
say
something
ungracious
certainly
said
lavender
with
a
readiness
that
pleased
sheila
at
least
have
no
right
to
complain
of
his
papa
is
a
very
handsome
man
said
lorraine
to
sheila
bringing
the
conversation
back
to
their
own
end
of
the
table
have
seen
few
finer
heads
than
that
drawing
you
have
mr
lavender
did
that
did
he
not
why
has
he
never
done
one
of
you
is
too
busy
i
think
just
now
sheila
said
perhaps
not
knowing
that
from
at
that
moment
depended
a
fan
which
might
have
given
evidence
as
to
the
extreme
scarcity
of
time
under
which
lavender
was
supposed
to
labor
has
a
splendid
head
said
ingram
you
know
that
he
is
called
the
king
of
borva
up
there
have
heard
of
him
being
called
the
king
of
thule
said
lorraine
turning
with
a
smile
to
sheila
of
his
daughter
being
styled
a
princess
do
you
know
the
ballad
of
the
king
of
thule
in
mrs
lavender
the
opera
yes
said
sheila
you
sing
it
for
us
after
dinner
you
the
promise
was
fulfilled
in
a
fashion
the
notion
that
ingram
was
about
to
go
away
up
to
lewis
to
the
people
who
knew
her
and
to
her
house
with
no
possible
answer
to
the
questions
which
would
certainly
be
showered
upon
him
as
to
why
she
had
not
come
also
troubled
sheila
deeply
the
ladies
went
into
the
and
lorraine
got
out
the
song
sheila
sat
down
to
the
piano
thinking
far
more
of
that
small
stone
house
at
borva
than
of
the
king
of
castle
overlooking
the
sea
and
yet
somehow
the
first
lines
of
the
song
though
she
knew
them
well
enough
sent
a
pang
to
her
heart
as
she
glanced
at
them
she
touched
the
first
notes
of
the
accompaniment
and
she
looked
at
the
words
again
the
sea
in
thule
of
old
reigned
a
king
who
was
who
in
remembrance
of
one
departed
a
mist
came
over
her
eyes
was
she
the
one
who
had
departed
leaving
the
old
king
in
his
desolate
house
by
the
sea
where
he
could
only
think
of
her
as
he
sat
in
his
solitary
chamber
with
the
night
winds
howling
around
the
shore
outside
when
her
birthday
had
come
around
she
knew
that
he
must
have
silently
drank
to
her
though
not
out
of
a
beaker
of
gold
and
now
when
mere
friends
and
acquaintances
were
free
to
speed
away
to
the
north
and
get
a
welcome
from
the
folks
in
borva
and
listen
to
the
atlantic
waves
dashing
lightly
in
among
the
rocks
her
hope
of
getting
thither
had
almost
died
out
among
such
people
as
landed
on
stornoway
quay
from
the
big
clansman
her
father
would
seek
one
face
and
seek
it
in
vain
and
duncan
and
scarlett
and
even
john
the
piper
all
the
folks
who
lived
far
away
across
the
minch
they
would
ask
why
miss
sheila
was
never
coming
back
lorraine
had
been
standing
aside
from
the
piano
noticing
that
sheila
had
played
the
introduction
to
the
song
twice
over
in
an
undetermined
manner
she
came
forward
a
step
or
two
and
pretended
to
be
looking
at
the
music
tears
were
running
down
face
lorraine
put
her
hand
on
the
shoulder
and
sheltered
her
from
observation
and
said
aloud
have
it
in
a
different
key
have
you
not
pray
sing
it
sing
something
else
do
you
know
any
of
sacred
songs
let
me
see
if
we
can
find
anything
for
you
in
this
they
were
a
long
time
finding
anything
in
that
volume
when
they
did
find
it
behold
it
was
one
of
songs
and
that
young
lady
said
if
mrs
lavender
would
only
allow
herself
to
be
superseded
for
a
few
minutes
and
so
sheila
walked
with
her
head
down
to
the
conservatory
which
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
piano
and
lorraine
not
only
sung
this
french
song
but
sang
every
one
of
the
verses
and
at
the
end
of
it
she
had
quite
forgotten
that
sheila
had
promised
to
sing
are
very
sensitive
she
said
to
sheila
coming
into
the
conservatory
am
very
stupid
sheila
said
with
her
face
burning
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
will
see
the
highlands
and
ingram
was
talking
of
the
places
i
know
and
and
so
understand
well
enough
said
lorraine
tenderly
as
if
sheila
was
a
mere
child
in
her
hands
you
must
not
get
your
eyes
red
you
have
to
sing
some
of
those
highland
songs
for
us
when
the
gentlemen
come
in
come
up
to
my
room
and
i
will
make
your
eyes
all
right
oh
do
not
be
afraid
i
shall
not
bring
you
down
like
lady
leveret
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
that
face
it
reminds
me
of
the
window
of
an
oil
and
color
shop
i
wonder
she
does
not
catch
flies
with
her
so
all
the
people
sheila
learned
that
night
were
going
away
from
london
and
she
and
her
husband
would
join
in
the
general
stampede
of
the
very
last
dwellers
in
town
but
mairi
what
was
to
become
of
her
after
that
little
plot
had
been
played
out
sheila
could
not
leave
mairi
to
see
london
by
herself
she
had
been
enjoying
beforehand
the
delight
of
taking
the
young
girl
about
and
watching
the
wonder
of
her
eyes
nor
could
she
fairly
postpone
visit
and
mairi
was
coming
up
in
another
couple
of
days
on
the
morning
on
which
the
visitor
from
the
far
hebrides
was
to
make
her
appearance
in
london
sheila
felt
conscious
of
a
great
hypocrisy
in
bidding
to
her
husband
on
some
excuse
or
other
she
had
had
breakfast
ordered
early
and
he
found
himself
ready
at
nine
to
go
out
for
the
day
she
said
you
come
in
to
lunch
at
two
he
asked
he
did
not
often
have
luncheon
at
home
will
go
into
the
park
with
you
in
the
afternoon
if
you
like
she
said
all
the
scene
had
been
diligently
rehearsed
on
one
side
before
lavender
was
a
little
surprised
but
he
was
in
an
amiable
mood
right
he
said
something
with
olives
in
it
two
with
that
he
went
out
and
sheila
with
a
wild
commotion
at
her
heart
saw
him
walk
away
through
the
square
she
was
afraid
mairi
might
have
arrived
before
he
left
and
indeed
he
had
not
gone
above
a
few
minutes
when
a
drove
up
and
an
elderly
man
got
out
and
waited
for
the
girl
inside
to
alight
with
rush
like
that
of
a
startled
deer
sheila
was
down
the
stairs
along
the
hall
and
on
the
pavement
and
it
was
mairi
and
have
you
come
at
last
and
are
you
very
well
and
how
are
all
the
people
in
borva
and
how
are
you
and
will
you
come
into
the
house
certainly
that
was
a
strange
sight
for
a
decorous
london
square
the
mistress
of
a
house
a
young
girl
with
bare
head
coming
out
on
the
pavement
to
shake
hands
in
a
frantic
fashion
with
a
young
and
an
elderly
man
whose
clothes
had
been
pretty
well
tanned
by
sunlight
and
and
sheila
would
herself
help
to
carry
luggage
in
and
she
would
take
no
denial
from
whose
luggage
was
also
carried
in
and
she
would
herself
pay
the
cabman
as
strangers
did
not
know
about
these
things
knowledge
being
exhibited
by
her
hastily
giving
the
man
five
shillings
for
driving
from
euston
station
and
there
was
breakfast
waiting
for
them
both
as
soon
as
mairi
could
get
her
face
washed
and
would
have
a
glass
of
whisky
after
the
traveling
and
it
was
very
good
whisky
whatever
as
it
had
come
all
the
way
from
stornoway
was
nothing
loath
wass
you
pretty
well
miss
sheila
said
mairi
looking
timidly
and
hastily
up
and
forgetting
altogether
that
sheila
had
another
name
now
will
be
a
great
thing
for
me
to
go
back
to
sa
lewis
and
tell
them
i
wass
seeing
you
and
you
wass
looking
so
well
and
i
will
be
thinking
i
wass
neffer
coming
to
any
one
i
knew

more
and
it
is
a
great
fright
i
hef
had
since
we
came
away
from
sa
lewis
and
i
wass
thinking
we
would
neffer
find
you
among
all
sa
people
and
so
far
away
across
sa
sea
and
sa
land
eh
the
girl
stopped
in
astonishment
her
eyes
had
wandered
up
to
a
portrait
on
the
walls
and
here
in
this
very
room
after
she
had
traveled
over
all
this
great
distance
apparently
leaving
behind
her
everything
but
the
memory
of
her
home
was
mackenzie
himself
looking
at
her
from
under
his
shaggy
eyebrows
must
have
seen
that
picture
in
borva
mairi
sheila
said
come
with
me
like
a
good
girl
and
get
yourself
ready
for
breakfast
do
you
know
mairi
it
does
my
heart
good
to
hear
you
talk
again
i
think
i
shall
be
able
to
let
you
go
back
to
the
you
hef
changed
ferry
much
in
your
way
of
speaking
miss
lavender
said
mairi
with
an
effort
will
speak
just
like
sa
english
english
say
so
replied
sheila
with
a
smile
leading
the
way
up
stairs
had
his
business
to
attend
to
but
being
a
sensible
man
he
took
advantage
of
the
profuse
breakfast
placed
before
him
mairi
was
a
little
too
frightened
and
nervous
and
happy
to
eat
much
but
was
an
old
traveler
not
to
be
put
out
by
the
mere
meeting
of
two
girls
he
listened
in
a
grave
and
complacent
manner
to
the
rapid
questions
and
answers
of
mairi
and
her
hostess
but
he
himself
was
too
busy
to
join
in
the
conversation
much
at
the
end
of
breakfast
he
accepted
after
a
little
pressing
half
a
glass
of
whisky
and
then
much
comforted
and
in
a
thoroughly
good
humor
with
himself
and
the
world
got
his
luggage
out
again
and
went
on
his
way
toward
a
certain
inn
in
high
holborn
and
where
does
the
queen
live
miss
sheila
said
mairi
she
had
been
looking
at
the
furniture
in
house
and
wondering
if
the
queen
lived
in
a
place
still
more
beautiful
than
this
long
way
from
it
iss
no
wonder
said
mairi
will
neffer
hef
been
in
sa
lewis
i
wass
neffer
thinking
the
world
wass
so
big
and
it
wass
many
a
time
since
me
and
hef
come
away
from
styornoway
i
wass
thinking
it
wass
too
far
for
me
effer
to
get
back
again
but
it
iss
many
a
one
will
say
to
me
before
i
hef
left
the
lewis
that
i
wass
not
to
come
home
unless
you
wass
coming
too
and
i
wass
to
bring
you
back
with
me
miss
sheila
and
where
is
bras
miss
sheila
will
see
him
by
and
by
he
is
out
in
the
garden
she
said
without
knowing
it
will
he
understand
the
gaelic
yet
yes
sheila
said
he
is
sure
to
remember
there
was
no
mistake
about
that
when
mairi
went
into
the
back
garden
the
demonstrations
of
delight
on
the
part
of
the
great
deerhound
were
as
pronounced
as
his
dignity
and
gravity
would
allow
and
mairi
fairly
fell
upon
his
neck
and
kissed
him
and
addressed
to
him
a
hundred
endearing
phrases
in
gaelic
every
word
of
which
it
was
quite
obvious
that
the
dog
understood
london
was
already
beginning
to
be
less
terrible
to
her
she
had
met
and
talked
with
sheila
here
was
bras
a
portrait
of
the
king
of
borva
was
hung
up
inside
and
all
around
the
rooms
were
articles
which
she
had
known
in
the
north
before
sheila
had
married
and
brought
them
away
into
this
strange
land
have
never
asked
after
my
husband
mairi
said
sheila
thinking
to
confuse
the
girl
but
mairi
was
not
confused
probably
she
had
been
fancying
that
mr
lavender
was
down
at
the
shore
or
had
gone
out
fishing
or
something
of
that
sort
and
would
return
soon
enough
it
was
sheila
not
he
whom
she
was
concerned
about
indeed
mairi
had
caught
up
a
little
of
that
jealousy
of
lavender
which
was
rife
among
the
borva
folks
they
would
speak
no
ill
of
mr
lavender
the
young
gentleman
whom
miss
sheila
had
chosen
had
by
that
very
fact
a
claim
upon
their
respect
was
a
person
of
importance
and
yet
in
their
secret
hearts
they
bore
a
grudge
against
him
what
right
had
he
to
come
away
up
to
the
north
and
carry
off
the
very
pride
of
the
island
were
english
girls
not
good
enough
for
him
that
he
must
needs
come
up
and
take
away
sheila
mackenzie
and
keep
her
there
in
the
south
so
that
her
friends
and
acquaintances
saw
no
more
of
her
before
the
marriage
mairi
had
a
great
liking
and
admiration
for
mr
lavender
she
was
so
pleased
to
see
miss
sheila
pleased
that
she
approved
of
the
young
man
and
thanking
him
in
her
heart
for
making
her
cousin
and
mistress
so
obviously
happy
perhaps
indeed
mairi
managed
to
fall
in
love
with
him
a
little
bit
herself
merely
by
force
of
example
and
through
sympathy
with
sheila
and
she
was
rapidly
forming
very
good
opinions
of
the
english
race
and
their
ways
and
their
looks
but
when
lavender
took
away
sheila
from
borva
a
change
came
over
sentiments
she
gradually
fell
in
with
the
current
opinions
of
the
island
that
it
was
a
great
pity
sheila
had
not
married
young
macintyre
of
sutherland
or
some
one
who
would
have
allowed
her
to
remain
among
her
own
people
mairi
began
to
think
that
the
english
though
they
were
handsome
and
and
free
with
their
money
were
on
the
whole
a
selfish
race
inconsiderate
and
forgetful
of
promises
she
began
to
dislike
the
english
and
wished
they
would
stay
in
their
own
country
and
not
interfere
with
other
people
hope
he
is
very
well
said
mairi
dutifully
she
could
at
least
say
that
honestly
will
see
him
at
two
he
is
coming
in
to
luncheon
and
he
does
not
know
you
are
here
and
you
are
to
be
a
great
surprise
to
him
mairi
and
there
is
to
be
a
greater
surprise
still
for
we
are
going
to
make
one
of
the
rooms
into
the
at
home
and
you
must
open
your
boxes
and
bring
me
down
the
heather
and
the
peat
mairi
and
the
two
bottles
and
then
you
know
when
the
salmon
is
on
the
table
and
the
whisky
and
the
beer
and
bras
lying
on
the
and
the
all
through
the
room
then
you
will
come
in
and
shake
hands
with
him
and
he
will
think
he
is
in
borva
mairi
was
a
little
puzzled
she
did
not
understand
the
intention
of
this
strange
thing
but
she
went
and
fetched
the
materials
she
had
brought
with
her
from
lewis
and
sheila
and
she
set
to
work
it
was
a
pleasant
enough
occupation
for
this
bright
forenoon
and
sheila
as
she
had
heard
sweet
highland
speech
and
as
she
brought
from
all
parts
of
the
house
the
curiosities
sent
her
from
the
hebrides
would
almost
have
fancied
she
was
superintending
a
of
that
little
at
borva
skins
of
foxes
seals
and
deer
stuffed
eagles
and
strange
fishes
masses
of
coral
and
wonderful
carvings
in
wood
brought
from
abroad
shells
of
every
size
from
every
clime
all
these
were
brought
together
into
frank
the
ordinary
ornaments
of
the
mantelpiece
gave
way
to
fanciful
arrangements
of
feathers
ling
and
the
beautiful
spikes
of
the
formed
the
staple
of
the
decorations
and
mairi
had
brought
enough
to
adorn
an
assembly
room
is
like
the
lewis
people
sheila
said
with
a
laugh
she
had
not
been
in
as
happy
a
mood
for
many
a
day
asked
you
to
bring
one
peat
and
of
course
you
brought
two
tell
the
truth
mairi
could
you
have
forced
yourself
to
bring
one
peat
wass
thinking
it
was
safer
to
bring
sa
two
replied
mairi
blushing
all
over
the
fair
and
pretty
face
and
indeed
there
being
two
peats
sheila
thought
she
might
as
well
try
an
experiment
with
one
she
crumbled
down
some
pieces
put
them
on
a
plate
lit
them
and
placed
the
plate
outside
the
open
window
on
the
soil
presently
a
new
sweet
fragrance
came
floating
in
and
sheila
almost
forgot
the
success
of
the
experiment
in
the
reminiscences
called
up
by
the
scent
of
the
peat
mairi
failed
to
see
how
any
one
could
willfully
smoke
a
house
any
one
that
is
to
say
who
did
not
save
the
smoke
for
his
thatch
and
who
was
so
particular
as
sheila
had
been
about
having
the
clothes
come
in
from
the
washing
dried
so
that
they
should
not
retain
this
very
odor
that
seemed
now
to
delight
her
at
last
the
room
was
finished
and
sheila
contemplated
it
with
much
satisfaction
the
table
was
laid
and
on
the
white
cloth
stood
the
bottles
most
familiar
to
borva
the
still
lingered
in
the
air
she
could
not
have
wished
anything
to
be
better
then
she
went
off
to
look
after
the
luncheon
and
mairi
was
permitted
to
go
down
and
explore
the
mysteries
of
the
kitchen
the
servants
were
not
accustomed
to
this
interference
and
oversight
and
might
have
resented
it
only
that
sheila
had
proved
a
very
good
mistress
to
them
and
had
shown
too
that
she
would
have
her
own
way
when
she
wanted
it
suddenly
as
sheila
was
explaining
to
mairi
the
use
of
some
particular
piece
of
mechanism
she
heard
a
sound
that
made
her
heart
jump
it
was
now
but
one
and
yet
that
was
surely
her
foot
in
the
hall
for
a
moment
she
was
too
bewildered
to
know
what
to
do
she
heard
him
go
straight
into
the
very
room
she
had
been
decorating
the
door
of
which
she
had
left
open
then
as
she
went
upstairs
with
her
heart
still
beating
fast
the
first
thing
that
met
her
eyes
was
a
tartan
shawl
belonging
to
mairi
that
had
been
accidentally
left
in
the
passage
her
husband
must
have
seen
it
what
nonsense
is
this
he
said
he
was
evidently
in
a
hurry
and
yet
she
could
not
answer
her
heart
was
throbbing
too
quickly
here
he
said
wish
give
up
this
till
kavanagh
lorraine
and
lord
arthur
redmond
are
coming
here
to
luncheon
at
two
i
suppose
you
can
get
something
decent
for
them
what
is
the
matter
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
and
then
his
eyes
rested
on
the
tartan
shawl
which
he
had
really
not
noticed
before
is
in
the
house
he
said
you
asked
some
washerwoman
to
lunch
sheila
managed
at
last
to
say
is
mairi
come
from
stornoway
i
was
thinking
you
would
be
surprised
to
see
her
when
you
came
these
preparations
are
for
her
sheila
said
nothing
there
was
that
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
which
was
gradually
bringing
her
to
herself
and
giving
her
quite
sufficient
firmness
now
that
this
girl
has
come
up
i
suppose
you
mean
to
introduce
her
to
all
your
friends
and
i
suppose
you
expect
those
people
who
are
coming
in
half
an
hour
to
sit
down
at
table
with
a
said
sheila
standing
quite
erect
but
with
her
eyes
cast
down
my
cousin
be
ridiculous
sheila
you
know
very
well
that
mairi
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
and
i
suppose
you
mean
to
take
her
out
of
the
kitchen
and
introduce
her
to
people
and
expect
her
to
sit
down
at
table
with
them
is
not
that
so
she
did
not
answer
and
he
went
on
impatiently
was
i
not
told
that
this
girl
was
coming
to
stay
at
my
house
surely
i
have
some
right
to
know
what
guests
you
invite
that
i
may
be
able
at
least
to
ask
my
friends
not
to
come
near
the
house
while
they
are
in
i
did
not
tell
you
before
yes
that
was
a
pity
said
sheila
sadly
and
calmly
it
will
be
no
trouble
to
you
when
lorraine
comes
up
at
two
there
will
be
luncheon
for
her
and
for
her
friends
she
will
not
have
to
sit
down
with
any
of
my
relations
or
with
me
for
if
they
are
not
fit
to
meet
her
i
am
not
and
it
is
not
any
great
matter
that
i
do
not
meet
her
at
two
there
was
no
passion
of
any
sort
in
the
measured
and
sad
voice
nor
in
the
somewhat
pale
face
and
downcast
eyes
perhaps
it
was
this
composure
that
deceived
frank
lavender
at
all
events
he
turned
and
walked
out
of
the
house
satisfied
that
he
would
not
have
to
introduce
this
highland
cousin
to
his
friends
and
just
as
certain
that
sheila
would
repent
of
her
resolve
and
appear
in
the
as
usual
sheila
went
down
stairs
to
the
kitchen
where
mairi
still
stood
awaiting
her
she
gave
orders
to
one
of
the
servants
about
having
luncheon
laid
in
the
at
two
and
then
she
bade
mairi
follow
her
she
said
when
they
were
alone
want
you
to
put
your
things
in
your
trunk
at
once
in
five
minutes
if
you
can
i
shall
be
waiting
for
sheila
cried
the
girl
looking
up
to
her
face
with
a
sudden
fright
seizing
her
heart
is
the
matter
with
you
you
are
going
to
die
is
nothing
the
matter
mairi
i
am
going
she
uttered
the
words
placidly
but
there
was
a
pained
look
about
the
lips
that
could
not
be
concealed
and
her
face
unknown
to
herself
had
the
whiteness
of
despair
in
it
away
said
mairi
in
a
bewildered
way
are
you
going
miss
sheila
will
tell
you
by
and
by
get
your
trunk
ready
mairi
you
are
keeping
me
then
she
called
for
a
servant
who
was
sent
for
a
cab
and
by
the
time
the
vehicle
appeared
mairi
was
ready
to
get
into
it
and
her
trunk
was
put
on
the
top
then
clad
in
the
rough
blue
dress
she
used
to
wear
in
borva
and
with
no
appearance
of
haste
or
fear
in
the
calm
and
face
sheila
came
out
from
her
house
and
found
herself
alone
in
the
world
there
were
two
little
girls
the
daughters
of
a
neighbor
passing
by
at
the
time
she
patted
them
on
the
head
and
bade
them
could
she
recollect
five
minutes
thereafter
having
seen
them
there
was
a
strange
and
distant
look
in
her
eyes
she
got
into
the
cab
and
sat
down
by
mairi
and
then
took
the
hand
am
sorry
to
take
you
away
mairi
she
said
but
she
was
apparently
not
thinking
of
mairi
nor
of
the
house
she
was
leaving
nor
yet
of
the
vehicle
in
which
she
was
so
strangely
placed
was
she
thinking
of
a
certain
wild
and
wet
day
in
the
far
hebrides
when
a
young
bride
stood
on
the
decks
of
a
great
vessel
and
saw
the
home
of
her
childhood
and
the
friends
of
her
youth
fade
back
into
the
desolate
waste
of
the
sea
perhaps
there
may
have
been
some
unconscious
influence
in
this
picture
to
direct
her
movements
at
this
moment
for
of
definite
resolves
she
had
none
when
mairi
told
her
that
the
cabman
wanted
to
know
whither
he
was
to
drive
she
merely
answered
yes
mairi
we
will
go
to
the
station
and
mairi
added
addressing
the
man
was
the
euston
then
they
drove
away
you
going
home
said
the
young
girl
looking
up
with
a
strange
foreboding
and
sinking
of
the
heart
to
the
pale
face
and
distant
eyes
you
going
home
miss
sheila
yes
we
are
going
home
mairi
was
the
answer

the
tone
in
which
it
was
uttered
filled
her
mind
with
doubt

something
like
despair

chapter
xix
a
new
day
breaks
was
this
then
the
end
of
the
fair
and
beautiful
romance
that
had
sprung
up
and
blossomed
so
hopefully
in
the
remote
and
bleak
island
amid
the
silence
of
the
hills
and
moors
and
the
wild
twilights
of
the
north
and
set
around
about
as
it
were
by
the
cold
and
the
sound
of
the
atlantic
waves
who
could
have
fancied
looking
at
those
two
young
folks
as
they
wandered
about
the
shores
of
the
island
as
they
sailed
on
the
still
moonlight
nights
through
the
channels
of
loch
roag
or
as
they
sang
together
of
an
evening
in
the
little
parlor
of
the
house
at
borvapost
that
all
the
delight
and
wonder
of
life
then
apparently
opening
out
before
them
was
so
soon
and
so
suddenly
to
collapse
leaving
them
in
outer
darkness
and
despair
all
their
difficulties
had
been
got
over
from
one
side
and
from
another
they
had
received
generous
help
friendly
advice
to
start
them
on
a
path
that
seemed
to
be
strewn
with
flowers
and
here
was
the
end
a
wretched
girl
blinded
and
bewildered
flying
from
her
house
and
seeking
refuge
in
the
great
world
of
london
careless
whither
she
went
whose
was
the
fault
which
of
them
had
been
mistaken
up
there
in
the
north
laying
the
way
open
for
a
bitter
disappointment
or
had
either
of
them
failed
to
carry
out
that
unwritten
contract
entered
into
in
the
halcyon
period
of
courtship
by
which
young
people
promise
to
be
and
remain
to
each
other
all
that
they
then
appeared
lavender
at
least
had
no
right
to
complain
if
the
real
sheila
turned
out
to
be
something
different
from
the
sheila
of
his
fancy
he
had
been
abundantly
warned
that
such
would
be
the
case
he
had
even
accepted
it
as
probable
and
said
that
as
the
sheila
whom
he
might
come
to
know
must
doubtless
be
better
than
the
sheila
whom
he
had
imagined
there
was
little
danger
in
store
for
either
he
would
love
the
true
sheila
even
better
than
the
creature
of
his
brain
had
he
done
so
he
found
beside
him
this
proud
and
sensitive
highland
girl
full
of
generous
impulses
that
craved
for
the
practical
work
of
helping
other
people
longing
with
the
desire
of
a
caged
bird
for
the
free
winds
and
light
of
heaven
the
sight
of
hills
and
the
sound
of
seas
and
he
could
not
understand
why
she
could
not
conform
to
the
usages
of
city
life
he
was
disappointed
that
she
did
not
do
so
the
imaginative
sheila
who
was
to
appear
as
a
wonderful
in
london
had
disappeared
now
and
the
real
sheila
who
did
not
care
to
go
with
him
into
that
society
which
he
loved
or
affected
to
love
he
had
not
learned
to
know
and
had
she
been
mistaken
in
her
estimate
of
frank
character
at
the
very
moment
of
her
leaving
her
house
if
she
had
been
asked
the
question
she
would
have
turned
and
proudly
answered
she
had
been
disappointed
so
grievously
disappointed
that
her
heart
seemed
to
be
breaking
over
it
but
the
manner
in
which
frank
lavender
had
fallen
away
from
all
the
promises
he
had
given
was
due
not
to
himself
but
to
the
influence
of
the
society
around
him
of
that
she
was
quite
assured
he
had
shown
himself
careless
indifferent
inconsiderate
to
the
verge
of
cruelty
but
he
was
not
she
had
convinced
herself
consciously
cruel
nor
yet
selfish
nor
radically
in
any
way
in
her
opinion
at
least
he
was
courageously
sincere
to
the
verge
of
shocking
people
who
mistook
his
frankness
for
impudence
he
was
recklessly
generous
he
would
have
given
the
coat
off
his
back
to
a
beggar
at
the
instigation
of
a
sudden
impulse
provided
he
could
have
got
into
a
cab
before
any
of
his
friends
saw
him
he
had
rare
abilities
and
at
times
wildly
ambitious
dreams
not
of
his
own
glorification
but
of
what
he
would
do
to
celebrate
the
beauty
and
the
graces
of
the
princess
whom
he
fancied
he
had
married
it
may
seem
hard
of
belief
that
this
man
judging
him
by
his
actions
at
this
time
could
have
had
anything
of
thorough
and
manliness
in
his
nature
but
when
things
were
at
their
very
worst
when
he
appeared
to
the
world
as
a
idler
careless
of
a
noble
unbounded
love
when
his
indifference
or
worse
had
actually
driven
from
his
house
a
young
wife
who
had
especial
claims
on
his
forbearance
and
consideration
there
were
two
people
who
still
believed
in
frank
lavender
they
were
sheila
mackenzie
and
edward
ingram
and
a
wife
and
his
oldest
friend
generally
know
something
about
his
real
nature
its
besetting
temptations
its
weakness
its
strength
and
its
possibilities
of
course
ingram
was
speedily
made
aware
of
all
that
had
happened
lavender
went
home
at
the
appointed
hour
to
luncheon
accompanied
by
his
three
acquaintances
he
had
met
them
accidentally
in
the
forenoon
and
as
lorraine
was
most
particular
in
her
inquiries
about
sheila
he
thought
he
could
not
do
better
than
ask
her
there
and
then
with
her
mother
and
lord
arthur
to
have
luncheon
at
two
what
followed
on
his
carrying
the
announcement
to
sheila
we
know
he
left
the
house
taking
it
for
granted
that
there
would
be
no
trouble
when
he
returned
perhaps
he
reproached
himself
for
having
spoken
so
sharply
but
sheila
was
really
very
thoughtless
in
such
matters
at
two
everything
would
be
right
sheila
must
see
how
it
would
be
impossible
to
introduce
a
young
highland
to
two
fastidious
ladies
and
the
son
of
a
great
conservative
peer
lavender
met
his
three
friends
once
more
and
walked
up
to
the
house
with
them
letting
them
in
indeed
with
his
own
passing
the
he
saw
that
the
table
was
laid
there
this
was
well
sheila
had
been
reasonable
they
went
to
the
sheila
was
not
there
lavender
rang
the
bell
and
bade
the
servant
tell
her
mistress
she
was
wanted
lavender
has
gone
out
sir
said
the
servant
indeed
he
said
taking
the
matter
quite
coolly
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
sir
she
went
out
with
the
the
young
lady
who
came
this
well
let
me
know
when
luncheon
is
lavender
turned
to
his
guests
feeling
a
little
awkward
but
appearing
to
treat
the
matter
in
a
light
and
humorous
way
he
imagined
that
sheila
resenting
what
he
had
said
had
resolved
to
take
mairi
away
and
find
her
lodgings
elsewhere
perhaps
that
might
be
done
in
time
to
let
sheila
come
back
to
receive
his
guests
sheila
did
not
appear
however
and
luncheon
was
announced
suppose
we
may
as
well
go
down
said
lavender
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
is
impossible
to
say
when
she
may
come
back
she
is
such
a
creature
that
she
would
never
think
of
herself
or
her
own
affairs
in
looking
after
this
girl
from
they
went
down
stairs
and
took
their
places
at
the
table
my
part
said
lorraine
think
it
is
very
unkind
not
to
wait
for
poor
mrs
lavender
she
may
come
in
dreadfully
tired
and
that
would
not
vex
her
so
much
as
the
notion
that
you
had
waited
on
her
account
said
husband
with
a
smile
and
lorraine
was
pleased
to
hear
him
sometimes
speak
in
a
kindly
way
of
the
highland
girl
whom
he
had
married
guests
were
going
somewhere
after
luncheon
and
he
had
to
go
with
them
lorraine
stipulating
that
sheila
should
be
induced
to
come
also
but
when
luncheon
was
over
and
sheila
had
not
appeared
he
changed
his
intention
he
would
remain
at
home
he
saw
his
three
friends
depart
and
went
into
the
study
and
lit
a
cigar
how
odd
the
place
seemed
sheila
had
left
no
instructions
about
the
removal
of
those
barbaric
decorations
she
had
placed
in
the
chamber
and
here
around
him
seemed
to
be
the
walls
of
the
little
room
at
borvapost
with
its
big
shells
its
feathers
its
skins
and
stuffed
fish
and
masses
of
crimson
was
there
not
too
an
odor
of
in
the
air
and
then
his
eyes
caught
sight
of
the
plate
that
still
stood
on
the
windowsill
with
the
ashes
of
the
burned
peat
on
it
odd
child
she
is
he
thought
with
a
smile
go
playing
at
and
trying
to
fancy
she
was
up
in
lewis
again
i
suppose
she
would
like
to
let
her
hair
down
again
and
take
off
her
shoes
and
stockings
and
go
wading
along
the
sand
in
search
of
and
then
somehow
his
fancies
went
back
to
the
old
time
when
he
had
first
seen
and
admired
her
wild
ways
her
fearless
occupations
by
sea
and
shore
and
the
delight
of
active
work
that
shone
on
her
bright
face
and
in
her
beautiful
eyes
how
lithe
and
handsome
her
figure
used
to
be
in
that
blue
dress
when
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
boat
her
head
bent
back
her
arms
upstretched
and
pulling
at
some
rope
or
other
and
all
the
fine
color
of
exertion
in
the
bloom
of
her
cheeks
then
the
pride
with
which
she
saw
her
little
vessel
cutting
through
the
water
how
she
tightened
her
lips
with
a
joyous
determination
as
the
sheets
were
hauled
close
and
the
gunwale
of
the
small
boat
heeled
over
so
that
it
almost
touched
the
hissing
and
gurgling
foam
how
she
laughed
at
anxiety
as
she
rounded
some
rocky
point
and
sent
the
boat
spinning
into
the
clear
and
smooth
waters
of
the
bay
perhaps
after
all
it
was
too
bad
to
keep
the
poor
child
so
long
shut
up
in
a
city
she
was
evidently
longing
for
a
breath
of
sea
air
and
for
some
brief
dash
of
that
brisk
fearless
life
on
the
that
she
used
to
love
it
was
a
happy
life
after
all
and
he
had
himself
enjoyed
it
when
his
hands
and
face
got
browned
by
the
sun
when
he
grew
to
wonder
how
any
human
being
could
wear
black
garments
and
drink
foreign
wines
and
smoke
cigars
at
eighteenpence
a
piece
so
long
as
frieze
coats
whisky
and
a
pipe
were
procurable
how
one
slept
up
in
that
remote
island
after
all
the
laughing
and
drinking
and
singing
of
the
evening
were
over
how
sharp
was
the
monition
of
hunger
when
the
keen
sea
air
blew
about
your
face
on
issuing
out
in
the
morning
and
how
fresh
and
cool
and
sweet
was
that
early
breeze
with
the
scent
of
flowers
in
it
then
the
long
bright
day
at
the
with
the
black
pools
rippling
in
the
wind
and
in
the
silence
of
the
rapid
whistle
of
the
silken
line
through
the
air
with
now
and
then
the
of
a
big
salmon
rising
to
a
fly
further
down
the
pool
where
was
there
any
rest
like
the
rest
of
the
luncheon
when
duncan
had
put
the
big
fish
wrapped
in
rushes
under
the
shadow
of
the
nearest
rock
when
you
sat
down
on
the
warm
heather
and
lit
your
pipe
and
began
to
inquire
where
you
had
been
bitten
on
hands
and
neck
by
the
ferocious
while
you
are
too
busy
in
playing
a
to
care
then
perhaps
as
you
were
sitting
there
in
the
warm
sunlight
with
all
the
fresh
scents
of
moorland
around
you
would
hear
a
light
footstep
on
the
soft
moss
and
turning
around
here
was
sheila
herself
with
a
bright
look
in
her
pretty
eyes
and
a
half
blush
on
her
cheek
and
a
friendly
inquiry
as
to
the
way
the
fish
had
been
behaving
then
the
beautiful
strange
cool
evenings
on
the
shores
of
loch
roag
with
the
wild
clear
light
still
shining
in
the
northern
heavens
and
the
sound
of
the
waves
getting
to
be
lonely
and
distant
or
still
later
out
in
boat
with
the
great
yellow
moon
rising
up
over
suainabhal
and
mealasabhal
into
a
lambent
vault
of
violet
sky
a
pathway
of
quivering
gold
lying
across
the
loch
a
mild
radiance
glittering
here
and
there
on
the
spars
of
the
small
vessel
and
out
there
the
great
atlantic
lying
still
and
distant
as
in
a
dream
as
he
sat
in
this
little
room
and
thought
of
all
these
things
he
grew
to
think
he
had
not
acted
quite
fairly
to
sheila
she
was
so
fond
of
that
beautiful
island
life
and
she
had
not
even
visited
the
lewis
since
her
marriage
she
should
go
now
he
would
abandon
the
trip
to
the
tyrol
and
as
soon
as
arrangements
could
be
made
they
would
together
start
for
the
north
and
some
day
find
themselves
going
up
the
steep
shore
to
home
with
the
old
king
of
borva
standing
in
the
porch
of
the
house
and
endeavoring
to
conceal
his
nervousness
by
swearing
at
method
of
carrying
the
luggage
had
not
stratagem
succeeded
that
pretty
trick
of
hers
in
decorating
the
room
so
as
to
resemble
the
house
at
borvapost
had
done
all
that
she
could
have
desired
but
where
was
she
lavender
rose
hastily
and
looked
at
his
watch
then
he
rang
the
bell
and
a
servant
appeared
not
mrs
lavender
say
when
she
would
return
he
asked
know
where
she
went
sir
the
young
luggage
was
put
in
the
cab
and
they
drove
away
without
leaving
any
he
scarcely
dared
confess
to
himself
what
fears
began
to
assail
him
he
went
to
room
and
there
everything
appeared
to
be
in
its
usual
place
even
to
the
smallest
article
on
the
they
were
all
there
except
one
that
was
a
locket
too
large
and
clumsy
to
be
worn
which
some
one
had
given
her
years
before
she
left
lewis
and
in
which
her
portrait
had
been
somewhat
rudely
set
just
after
their
marriage
lavender
had
taken
out
this
portrait
touched
it
up
a
bit
into
somewhat
of
a
better
likeness
and
put
it
back
and
then
she
had
persuaded
him
to
have
a
photograph
of
himself
colored
and
placed
on
the
opposite
side
this
locket
open
and
showing
both
portraits
she
had
fixed
on
to
a
small
stand
and
in
ordinary
circumstances
it
always
stood
on
one
side
of
her
the
stand
was
there
the
locket
was
gone
he
went
again
the
afternoon
was
drawing
on
a
servant
came
to
ask
him
at
what
hour
he
wished
to
dine
he
bade
her
wait
till
her
mistress
came
home
and
consult
her
then
he
went
out
it
was
a
beautiful
quiet
afternoon
with
a
warm
light
from
the
west
shining
over
the
now
yellowing
trees
of
the
squares
and
gardens
he
walked
down
toward
notting
hill
gate
station
endeavoring
to
convince
himself
that
he
was
not
perturbed
and
yet
looking
somewhat
anxiously
at
the
cabs
that
passed
people
were
now
coming
out
from
their
business
in
the
city
by
train
and
omnibus
and
hansom
and
they
seemed
to
be
hurrying
home
in
very
good
spirits
as
if
they
were
sure
of
the
welcome
awaiting
them
there
now
and
again
you
would
see
a
meeting
some
demure
young
person
who
had
been
furtively
watching
the
railway
station
suddenly
showing
a
brightness
in
her
face
as
she
went
forward
to
shake
hands
with
some
new
arrival
and
then
tripping
briskly
away
with
him
her
hand
on
his
arm
there
were
men
carrying
home
fish
in
small
bags
or
baskets
of
fruit
presents
to
their
wives
doubtless
from
town
occasionally
an
open
carriage
would
go
by
containing
one
grave
and
elderly
gentleman
and
a
group
of
small
girls
probably
his
daughters
who
had
gone
into
the
city
to
accompany
their
papa
homeward
why
did
these
scenes
and
incidents
cheerful
in
themselves
seem
to
him
somewhat
saddening
as
he
walked
vaguely
on
he
knew
at
least
that
there
was
little
use
in
returning
home
there
was
no
one
in
that
silent
house
in
the
square
the
rooms
would
be
dark
in
the
twilight
probably
dinner
would
be
laid
with
no
one
to
sit
down
at
the
table
he
wished
sheila
had
left
word
where
she
was
going
then
he
bethought
himself
the
way
in
which
they
had
parted
and
of
the
sense
of
fear
that
had
struck
him
the
moment
he
left
the
house
that
after
all
he
had
been
too
harsh
with
the
child
now
at
least
he
was
ready
to
apologize
to
her
if
only
he
could
see
sheila
coming
along
in
one
of
those
hansoms
if
he
could
see
at
any
distance
the
figure
he
knew
so
well
walking
toward
him
on
the
pavement
would
he
not
instantly
confess
to
her
that
he
had
been
wrong
even
grievously
wrong
and
beg
her
to
forgive
him
she
should
have
it
all
her
own
way
about
going
up
to
lewis
he
would
cast
aside
this
society
life
he
had
been
living
and
to
please
her
he
would
go
in
for
any
sort
of
work
or
amusement
of
which
she
approved
he
was
so
anxious
indeed
to
put
these
virtuous
resolutions
into
force
that
he
suddenly
turned
and
walked
rapidly
back
to
the
house
with
the
wild
hope
that
sheila
might
have
already
come
back
the
windows
were
dark
the
curtains
were
yet
drawn
and
by
this
time
the
evening
had
come
on
and
the
lamps
in
the
square
had
been
lit
he
let
himself
into
the
house
by
his
he
walked
into
all
the
rooms
and
up
to
room
everything
remained
as
he
had
left
it
the
white
cloth
glimmered
in
the
dusk
of
the
and
the
light
of
the
lamp
outside
in
the
street
touched
here
and
there
the
angles
of
the
crystal
and
showed
the
pale
colors
of
the
glasses
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
ticked
in
the
silence
if
sheila
had
been
lying
dead
in
that
small
room
the
house
could
not
have
appeared
more
silent
and
solemn
he
could
not
bear
this
horrible
solitude
he
called
one
of
the
servants
and
left
a
message
for
sheila
if
she
came
in
in
the
interval
that
he
would
be
back
at
ten
then
he
went
out
got
into
a
hansom
and
drove
down
to
his
club
in
street
most
of
the
men
were
dining
the
other
rooms
were
almost
deserted
he
did
not
care
to
dine
just
then
he
went
into
the
library
it
was
occupied
by
an
old
gentleman
who
was
fast
asleep
in
an
he
went
into
the
in
the
vague
hope
that
some
exciting
game
might
be
going
on
there
was
not
a
soul
in
the
place
the
gases
were
down
and
an
odor
of
stale
smoke
pervaded
the
dismal
chambers
should
he
go
to
the
theatre
his
sitting
there
would
be
a
mockery
while
this
vague
and
terrible
fear
was
present
to
his
heart
or
go
down
to
see
ingram
as
had
been
his
wont
in
previous
hours
of
trouble
he
dared
not
go
near
ingram
without
some
more
definite
news
about
sheila
in
the
end
he
went
out
into
the
open
air
as
if
he
were
in
danger
of
being
stifled
and
walking
indeterminately
on
found
himself
once
more
at
his
own
house
the
place
was
still
quite
dark
he
knew
before
entering
that
sheila
had
not
returned
and
he
did
not
seem
to
be
surprised
it
was
now
long
after
their
ordinary
dinner
hour
when
he
went
into
the
house
he
bade
the
servants
light
the
gas
and
bring
up
dinner
he
would
himself
sit
down
at
this
solitary
table
if
only
for
the
purpose
of
finding
occupation
and
passing
this
terrible
time
of
suspense
it
never
occurred
to
him
as
it
might
have
occurred
to
him
at
one
time
that
sheila
had
made
some
blunder
somewhere
and
been
unavoidably
detained
he
did
not
think
of
any
possible
repetition
of
her
adventures
in
richmond
park
he
was
too
conscious
of
the
probable
reason
of
remaining
away
from
her
own
home
and
yet
from
minute
to
minute
he
fought
with
that
consciousness
and
sought
to
prove
to
himself
that
after
all
she
would
soon
be
heard
driving
up
to
the
door
he
ate
his
dinner
in
silence
and
then
drew
a
chair
up
to
the
fire
and
lit
a
cigar
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
driven
to
go
over
the
events
that
had
occurred
since
his
marriage
and
to
ask
himself
how
it
had
all
come
about
that
sheila
and
he
were
not
as
they
once
had
been
he
recalled
the
early
days
of
their
friendship
at
borva
the
beautiful
period
of
their
courtship
the
appearance
of
the
young
wife
in
london
and
the
close
relegation
of
sheila
to
the
domestic
affairs
of
the
house
while
he
had
chosen
for
himself
other
companions
other
interests
other
aims
there
was
no
attempt
at
in
these
communings
but
an
effort
sincere
enough
in
its
way
to
understand
how
all
this
had
happened
he
sat
and
dreamed
there
before
the
warmth
of
the
fire
with
the
slow
and
monotonous
ticking
of
the
clock
unconsciously
acting
on
his
brain
in
time
the
silence
the
warmth
the
monotonous
sound
produced
their
natural
effects
and
he
fell
fast
asleep
he
awoke
with
a
start
the
small
bell
on
the
mantelpiece
had
struck
the
hour
of
twelve
he
looked
around
and
knew
that
the
evil
had
come
upon
him
for
sheila
had
not
returned
and
all
his
most
dreadful
fears
of
that
evening
were
confirmed
sheila
had
gone
away
and
left
him
whither
had
she
gone
now
there
was
no
more
indecision
in
his
actions
he
got
his
hat
plunged
into
the
cold
night
air
and
finding
a
hansom
bade
the
man
drive
as
hard
as
he
could
go
down
to
sloane
street
there
was
a
light
in
windows
which
were
on
the
ground
floor
he
tapped
with
his
stick
on
one
of
the
panes
an
old
signal
that
had
been
in
constant
use
when
he
and
ingram
were
close
companions
and
friends
ingram
came
to
the
door
and
opened
it
the
light
of
a
lamp
glared
in
on
his
face
lavender
he
said
in
a
tone
of
surprise
the
other
could
not
speak
but
he
went
into
the
house
and
ingram
shutting
the
door
and
following
him
found
that
the
face
was
deadly
pale
he
said
and
stopped
what
about
her
said
ingram
keeping
quite
calm
but
with
wild
fancies
about
some
terrible
accident
almost
stopping
the
pulsations
of
his
heart
has
gone
ingram
did
not
seem
to
understand
has
gone
away
ingram
said
lavender
in
an
excited
way
know
anything
about
it
you
know
where
she
has
gone
what
am
i
to
do
ingram
how
am
i
to
find
her
good
god
you
understand
what
i
tell
you
and
now
it
is
past
midnight
and
my
poor
girl
may
be
wandering
about
the
streets
he
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
paying
almost
no
attention
in
his
excitement
to
the
small
man
who
stood
quite
quiet
a
trifle
afraid
perhaps
but
with
his
heart
full
of
a
blaze
of
anger
has
gone
away
from
your
house
he
said
slowly
made
her
do
that
did
said
lavender
in
a
hurried
way
have
acted
like
a
brute
to
her
that
is
true
enough
you
say
anything
to
me
ingram
i
feel
myself
far
more
guilty
than
anything
you
could
say
you
may
heap
reproaches
on
me
afterward
but
tell
me
ingram
what
am
i
to
do
you
know
what
a
proud
spirit
she
has
who
can
tell
what
she
might
do
she
go
home
she
would
be
too
proud
she
may
have
gone
and
drowned
you
control
yourself
and
tell
me
what
has
happened
how
am
i
to
help
you
said
ingram
stiffly
and
yet
disposed
somehow
perhaps
for
the
sake
of
sheila
perhaps
because
he
saw
that
the
young
and
distress
were
genuine
enough
not
to
be
too
rough
with
him
you
know
mairi
said
lavender
still
walking
up
and
down
the
room
in
an
excited
way
had
got
the
girl
up
here
without
telling
me
some
friends
of
mine
were
coming
home
to
luncheon
we
had
some
disagreement
about
mairi
being
present
and
then
sheila
said
something
about
not
remaining
in
the
house
if
mairi
did
not
something
of
that
sort
i
know
what
it
was
but
i
know
it
was
all
my
fault
and
if
she
has
been
driven
from
the
house
i
did
it
that
is
true
enough
and
where
do
you
think
she
has
gone
ingram
if
i
could
only
see
her
for
three
minutes
i
would
explain
everything
i
would
tell
her
how
sorry
i
am
for
everything
that
has
happened
and
she
would
see
when
she
went
back
how
everything
would
be
right
again
i
had
no
idea
that
she
would
go
away
it
was
mere
peevishness
that
made
me
object
to
mairi
meeting
those
people
and
i
had
no
idea
that
sheila
would
take
it
so
much
to
heart
now
tell
me
what
you
think
should
be
done
ingram
all
i
want
is
to
see
her
just
for
three
minutes
to
tell
her
it
was
all
a
mistake
and
that
she
will
never
have
to
fear
anything
like
that
ingram
heard
him
out
and
said
with
some
precision
you
mean
to
say
that
you
fancy
all
this
trouble
is
to
be
got
over
that
way
do
you
know
so
little
of
sheila
after
the
time
you
have
been
married
to
her
as
to
imagine
that
she
has
taken
this
step
out
of
some
momentary
caprice
and
that
a
few
words
of
apology
and
promise
will
cause
her
to
rescind
it
you
must
be
crazed
lavender
or
else
you
are
actually
as
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
that
girl
as
you
were
up
in
the
the
young
man
seemed
to
calm
down
his
excitement
and
impatience
but
it
was
because
of
a
new
fear
that
had
struck
him
and
that
was
visible
in
his
face
you
think
she
will
never
come
back
ingram
he
said
looking
aghast
know
she
may
not
at
all
events
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
once
having
resolved
to
leave
your
house
she
is
not
to
be
pacified
and
cajoled
by
a
few
phrases
and
a
promise
of
repentance
on
your
part
that
is
quite
sure
and
what
is
quite
as
sure
is
this
that
if
you
knew
just
now
where
she
was
the
most
foolish
thing
you
could
do
would
be
to
go
and
see
i
must
go
and
see
her
i
must
find
her
out
ingram
he
said
passionately
care
what
becomes
of
me
if
she
go
back
home
so
much
the
worse
for
me
but
i
find
her
out
and
know
that
she
is
safe
think
of
it
ingram
perhaps
she
is
walking
about
the
streets
somewhere
at
this
moment
and
you
know
her
proud
spirit
if
she
were
to
go
near
the
river
go
near
the
river
said
ingram
quietly
she
be
walking
about
the
streets
she
is
either
in
the
scotch
going
up
to
glasgow
or
else
she
has
got
some
lodgings
somewhere
along
with
mairi
has
she
any
money
said
lavender
and
then
he
thought
for
a
minute
was
some
money
her
father
gave
her
in
case
she
might
want
it
at
a
pinch
she
may
have
that
i
hope
she
has
that
i
was
to
have
given
her
money
morning
but
i
better
go
to
the
and
see
just
by
way
of
precaution
that
she
has
not
been
heard
of
i
may
as
well
do
that
as
nothing
i
could
not
go
home
to
that
empty
house
i
could
not
is
a
sensible
girl
she
is
safe
enough
said
ingram
if
you
care
about
going
home
you
may
as
well
remain
here
i
can
give
you
a
room
when
you
want
it
in
the
meantime
if
you
will
pull
a
chair
to
the
table
and
calm
yourself
and
take
it
for
granted
that
you
will
soon
be
assured
of
safety
i
will
tell
you
what
i
think
you
should
do
here
is
a
cigar
to
keep
you
occupied
there
are
whiskey
and
cold
water
back
there
if
you
like
you
will
do
no
good
by
punishing
yourself
in
small
matters
for
your
trouble
is
likely
to
be
serious
enough
i
can
tell
you
before
you
get
sheila
back
if
ever
you
get
her
back
take
the
chair
with
the
it
was
so
like
the
old
days
when
these
two
used
to
be
companions
many
and
many
a
time
had
the
younger
man
come
down
to
these
lodgings
with
all
his
troubles
and
wild
impulses
and
pangs
of
contrition
ready
to
be
revealed
and
then
ingram
concealing
the
liking
he
had
for
the
generous
waywardness
his
brilliant
and
facile
cleverness
and
his
dashes
of
honest
self
depreciation
would
gravely
lecture
him
and
put
him
right
and
send
him
off
comforted
frank
lavender
had
changed
much
since
then
the
handsome
boy
had
grown
into
a
man
of
the
world
there
was
less
in
his
manner
and
he
was
less
sensitive
to
the
opinions
and
criticisms
of
his
old
friend
but
ingram
who
was
not
prone
to
idealism
of
any
sort
had
never
ceased
to
believe
that
this
change
was
but
superficial
and
that
in
different
circumstances
and
with
different
aims
lavender
might
still
fulfill
the
best
promise
of
his
youth
have
been
a
good
friend
to
me
ingram
he
said
with
a
hot
blush
i
have
treated
you
as
badly
as
i
have
treated
by
jove
what
a
chance
i
had
at
one
time
he
was
looking
back
on
all
the
fair
pictures
his
imagination
had
drawn
while
yet
sheila
and
he
were
wandering
about
that
island
in
the
northern
seas
had
said
ingram
decisively
one
time
i
thought
you
the
most
fortunate
man
in
the
world
there
was
nothing
left
for
you
to
desire
so
far
as
i
could
see
you
were
young
and
strong
with
plenty
of
good
spirits
and
sufficient
ability
to
earn
yourself
an
honorable
living
and
you
had
won
the
love
of
the
most
beautiful
and
woman
i
have
known
you
never
seemed
to
me
to
know
what
that
meant
men
marry
women
there
is
no
difficulty
about
that
and
you
can
generally
get
an
amiable
sort
of
person
to
become
your
wife
and
have
a
sort
of
affection
for
you
and
so
on
but
how
many
have
bestowed
on
them
the
pure
and
exalted
passion
of
a
young
and
innocent
girl
who
is
ready
to
worship
with
all
the
fervor
of
a
warmly
imaginative
and
emotional
nature
the
man
she
has
chosen
to
love
and
suppose
he
is
young
too
and
capable
of
understanding
all
the
tender
sentiments
of
a
sensitive
and
loyal
woman
and
suppose
that
he
fancies
himself
as
much
in
love
with
her
as
she
with
him
these
conditions
are
not
often
fulfilled
i
can
tell
you
it
is
a
happy
fluke
when
they
are
many
a
day
ago
i
told
you
that
you
should
consider
yourself
more
fortunate
than
if
you
had
been
made
an
emperor
and
indeed
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
had
everything
in
the
shape
of
worldly
happiness
easily
within
your
reach
how
you
came
to
kick
away
the
ball
from
your
feet
well
god
only
knows
the
thing
is
inconceivable
to
me
you
are
sitting
here
as
you
used
to
sit
two
or
three
years
ago
and
in
the
interval
you
have
had
every
chance
in
life
and
now
if
you
are
not
the
most
wretched
man
in
london
you
ought
at
least
to
be
the
most
ashamed
and
head
was
buried
in
his
hands
he
did
not
speak
it
is
not
only
your
own
happiness
you
have
destroyed
when
you
saw
that
girl
first
she
was
as
and
contented
with
her
lot
as
any
human
being
could
be
from
one
end
to
the
other
not
the
slightest
care
disturbed
her
mind
and
then
when
she
intrusted
her
whole
life
to
you
when
she
staked
her
faith
in
human
nature
on
you
and
gave
you
all
the
treasures
of
hope
and
reverence
and
love
that
lay
in
her
pure
and
innocent
soul
my
god
what
have
you
done
with
these
it
is
not
that
you
have
shamed
and
insulted
her
as
a
wife
and
driven
her
out
of
her
home
there
are
other
homes
than
yours
where
she
would
be
welcome
a
thousand
times
over
but
you
have
destroyed
her
belief
in
everything
she
had
taught
herself
to
trust
you
have
outraged
the
tenderest
sentiments
of
her
heart
you
have
killed
her
faith
as
well
as
ruined
her
life
i
talk
plainly
i
can
not
do
otherwise
if
i
help
you
now
imagine
i
condone
what
you
have
done
i
would
cut
my
right
hand
off
first
for
sake
i
will
try
to
help
he
stopped
just
then
however
and
checked
the
indignation
that
had
got
the
better
of
his
ordinarily
restrained
manner
and
curt
speech
the
man
before
him
was
crying
bitterly
his
face
hidden
in
his
hands
here
lavender
he
said
presently
want
to
be
hard
on
you
i
tell
you
plainly
what
i
think
of
your
conduct
so
that
no
delusions
may
exist
between
us
and
i
will
say
this
for
you
that
the
only
excuse
you
have
is
no
excuse
said
the
other
sadly
enough
have
no
excuse
and
i
know
only
thing
then
you
can
say
in
mitigation
of
what
you
have
done
is
that
you
never
seem
to
have
understood
the
girl
whom
you
married
you
started
with
giving
her
a
fancy
character
when
you
first
went
to
the
lewis
and
once
you
had
got
the
bit
in
your
teeth
there
was
no
stopping
you
if
you
seek
now
to
get
sheila
back
to
you
the
best
thing
you
can
do
i
presume
would
be
to
try
to
see
her
as
she
is
to
win
her
regard
that
way
to
abandon
that
operatic
business
and
learn
to
know
her
as
a
thoroughly
good
woman
who
has
her
own
ways
and
notions
about
things
and
who
has
a
very
definite
character
underlying
that
extreme
gentleness
which
she
fancies
to
be
one
of
her
duties
the
child
did
her
dead
best
to
accommodate
herself
to
your
idea
of
her
and
failed
when
she
would
rather
have
been
living
a
brisk
and
active
life
in
the
country
or
by
the
seaside
running
wild
about
a
hillside
or
reading
strange
stories
in
the
evening
or
nursing
some
child
that
had
got
ill
you
had
her
dragged
into
a
sort
of
society
with
which
she
had
no
sympathy
whatever
and
the
odd
thing
to
me
is
that
you
yourself
seemed
to
be
making
an
effort
that
way
you
did
not
always
devote
yourself
to
fashionable
life
where
are
all
the
old
ambitions
you
used
to
talk
about
in
the
very
chair
you
are
now
sitting
in
there
any
hope
of
my
getting
sheila
back
he
said
looking
up
at
last
there
was
a
vague
and
bewildered
look
in
his
eyes
he
seemed
incapable
of
thinking
of
anything
but
that
know
said
ingram
one
thing
is
certain
you
will
never
get
her
back
to
repeat
the
experiment
that
has
just
ended
in
this
desperate
should
not
ask
that
he
said
hurriedly
should
not
ask
that
at
all
if
i
could
but
see
her
for
a
moment
i
would
ask
her
to
tell
me
everything
she
wanted
everything
she
demanded
as
conditions
and
i
would
obey
her
i
will
promise
to
do
everything
that
she
you
saw
her
you
could
give
her
nothing
but
promises
said
ingram
what
if
you
were
to
try
to
do
what
you
know
she
wishes
and
then
go
to
her
mean
said
lavender
glancing
up
with
another
startled
look
on
his
face
mean
that
i
am
to
remain
away
from
her
a
long
time
go
into
banishment
as
it
were
and
then
some
day
come
back
to
sheila
and
beg
her
to
forget
all
that
happened
long
before
mean
something
very
like
that
said
ingram
with
composure
know
that
it
would
be
successful
i
have
no
means
of
ascertaining
what
sheila
would
think
of
such
a
project
whether
she
would
think
that
she
could
ever
live
with
you
lavender
seemed
fairly
stunned
by
the
possibility
of
resolving
never
to
see
him
again
and
began
to
recall
what
ingram
had
many
a
time
said
about
the
strength
of
purpose
she
could
show
when
occasion
needed
her
faith
in
you
is
wholly
destroyed
your
case
is
hopeless
a
woman
may
cling
to
her
belief
in
a
man
through
good
report
and
evil
report
but
if
she
once
loses
it
she
never
recovers
it
but
there
is
this
hope
for
you
i
know
very
well
that
sheila
had
a
much
more
accurate
notion
of
you
than
you
ever
had
of
her
and
i
happen
to
know
also
that
at
the
very
time
when
you
were
most
deeply
distressing
her
here
in
london
she
held
the
firm
conviction
that
your
conduct
toward
her
your
habits
your
very
self
would
alter
if
you
could
only
be
persuaded
to
get
out
of
the
life
you
have
been
leading
that
was
true
at
least
up
to
the
time
of
your
leaving
brighton
she
believed
in
you
then
she
believed
that
if
you
were
to
cut
society
altogether
and
go
and
live
a
hardworking
life
somewhere
you
would
soon
become
once
more
the
man
she
fell
in
love
with
up
in
lewis
perhaps
she
was
mistaken
i
say
anything
about
it
the
terribly
cool
way
in
which
ingram
talked
separating
defining
exhibiting
so
that
he
and
his
companion
should
get
as
near
as
possible
to
what
he
believed
to
be
the
truth
of
the
situation
was
oddly
in
contrast
with
the
blind
and
passionate
yearning
of
the
other
for
some
glimpse
of
hope
his
whole
nature
seemed
to
go
out
in
a
cry
to
sheila
that
she
would
come
back
and
give
him
a
chance
of
atoning
for
the
past
at
length
he
rose
he
looked
strangely
haggard
and
his
eyes
scarcely
seemed
to
see
the
things
around
him
must
go
home
he
said
ingram
saw
that
he
merely
wanted
to
get
outside
and
walk
about
in
order
to
find
some
relief
from
this
anxiety
and
unrest
and
said
ought
i
think
to
stop
here
and
go
to
bed
but
if
you
would
rather
go
home
i
will
walk
up
with
you
if
you
when
the
two
men
went
out
the
night
air
smelt
sweet
and
moist
for
rain
had
fallen
and
the
city
trees
were
still
dripping
with
the
wet
and
rustling
in
the
wind
the
weather
had
changed
suddenly
and
now
in
the
deep
blue
overhead
they
knew
the
clouds
were
passing
swiftly
by
was
it
the
coming
light
of
the
morning
that
seemed
to
give
depth
and
richness
to
that
vault
while
the
pavements
of
the
streets
and
the
houses
grew
vaguely
distinct
and
gray
suddenly
in
turning
the
corner
into
piccadilly
they
saw
the
moon
appear
in
a
rift
of
those
passing
clouds
but
it
was
not
the
moonlight
that
shed
this
pale
and
wan
grayness
down
the
lonely
streets
it
is
just
at
this
moment
when
the
dawn
of
the
new
day
begins
to
tell
that
a
great
city
seems
at
its
deadest
and
in
the
profound
silence
and
amid
the
strange
transformations
of
the
cold
and
growing
light
a
man
is
thrown
in
upon
himself
and
holds
communion
with
himself
as
though
he
and
his
own
thoughts
were
all
that
was
left
in
the
world
not
a
word
passed
between
the
two
men
and
lavender
keenly
sensitive
to
all
such
impressions
and
now
and
again
shivering
slightly
either
from
cold
or
nervous
excitement
walked
blindly
along
the
deserted
streets
seeing
far
other
things
than
the
tall
houses
and
the
drooping
trees
and
the
growing
light
of
the
sky
it
seemed
to
him
at
this
moment
that
he
was
looking
at
funeral
there
was
a
great
stillness
in
that
small
house
at
borvapost
there
was
a
boat
own
boat
down
at
the
shore
there
and
there
were
two
or
three
figures
in
black
in
it
the
day
was
gray
and
rainy
the
sea
washed
along
the
melancholy
shores
the
far
hills
were
hidden
in
mist
and
now
he
saw
some
people
come
out
of
the
house
into
the
rain
and
the
bronze
and
bearded
men
had
oars
with
them
and
on
the
crossed
oars
there
was
a
coffin
placed
they
went
down
the
hillside
they
put
the
coffin
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
and
in
absolute
silence
except
for
the
wailing
of
the
women
they
pulled
away
down
the
dreary
loch
roag
till
they
came
to
the
island
where
the
burial
ground
is
they
carried
the
coffin
up
to
that
small
enclosure
with
its
rank
grass
growing
green
and
the
rain
falling
on
the
rude
stones
and
memorials
how
often
had
he
leaned
on
that
low
stone
wall
and
read
the
strange
inscriptions
in
various
tongues
over
the
graves
of
mariners
from
distant
countries
who
had
met
with
their
death
on
this
rocky
coast
had
not
sheila
herself
pointed
out
to
him
with
a
sad
air
how
many
of
these
memorials
bore
the
words
was
drowned
and
that
too
was
the
burden
of
the
rudely
spelt
legends
beginning
rutt
in
gott
or
under
hviler
stovit
and
sometimes
ending
with
the
pathetic
ist
unsre
the
fishermen
brought
the
coffin
to
the
grave
the
women
standing
back
a
bit
old
scarlett
macdonald
stroking
hair
and
bidding
the
girl
control
her
frantic
grief
though
the
old
woman
herself
could
hardly
speak
for
her
tears
and
lamentations
he
could
read
the
words
on
the
small
silver
plate
she
had
been
taken
away
from
all
association
with
him
and
his
name
and
who
was
this
old
man
with
the
white
hair
and
the
white
beard
whose
hands
were
tightly
clenched
and
his
lips
firm
and
a
look
as
of
death
in
the
sunken
and
wild
eyes
mackenzie
was
gray
a
year
before
he
said
suddenly
and
his
voice
startled
his
companion
you
think
it
is
possible
to
make
sheila
happy
again
can
i
tell
said
ingram
used
to
know
everything
she
could
wish
everything
she
was
thinking
about
if
you
find
her
out
now
will
you
get
to
know
will
you
see
what
i
can
do
not
by
asking
her
to
come
back
not
by
trying
to
get
back
my
own
happiness
but
anything
it
does
not
matter
what
it
is
i
can
do
for
her
if
she
would
rather
not
see
me
again
i
will
stay
away
will
you
ask
her
ingram
have
got
to
find
her
first
said
his
companion
young
girl
like
that
said
lavender
taking
no
heed
of
the
objection
she
can
not
always
be
unhappy
she
is
so
young
and
beautiful
and
takes
so
much
interest
in
many
things
surely
she
may
have
a
happy
might
have
mean
with
me
said
lavender
with
his
haggard
face
looking
still
more
haggard
in
the
increasing
light
mean
anything
that
can
be
done
any
way
of
life
that
will
make
her
comfortable
and
contented
again
anything
that
i
can
do
for
that
will
you
try
to
find
it
out
ingram
yes
i
will
said
the
other
who
had
been
thinking
with
much
foreboding
of
all
those
possibilities
ever
since
they
left
sloane
street
his
only
gleam
of
hope
being
a
consciousness
that
this
time
at
least
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
frank
absolute
sincerity
of
his
remorse
and
his
almost
morbid
craving
to
make
reparation
if
that
were
still
possible
they
reached
the
house
at
last
there
was
a
dim
light
shining
in
the
passage
lavender
went
on
and
threw
open
the
door
of
the
small
room
which
sheila
had
adorned
asking
ingram
to
follow
him
how
wild
and
strange
this
chamber
looked
with
the
wan
glare
of
the
dawn
shining
on
its
barbaric
decorations
from
the
on
the
shells
and
skins
and
feathers
that
sheila
had
placed
around
that
white
light
of
the
morning
was
now
shining
everywhere
into
the
silent
and
desolate
house
lavender
found
ingram
a
bedroom
and
then
he
turned
away
not
knowing
what
to
do
he
looked
into
room
there
were
dresses
bits
of
finery
and
what
not
that
he
knew
so
well
but
there
was
no
light
breathing
audible
in
the
silent
and
empty
chamber
he
shut
the
door
as
reverently
as
though
he
were
shutting
it
on
the
dead
and
went
down
stairs
and
threw
himself
almost
fainting
with
despair
and
fatigue
on
the
sofa
while
the
world
outside
awoke
to
a
new
day
with
all
its
countless
and
joyous
activities
and
duties
chapter
xx
a
surprise
there
was
no
letter
from
sheila
in
the
morning
and
lavender
as
soon
as
the
post
had
come
and
gone
went
up
to
room
and
woke
him
am
sorry
to
disturb
you
ingram
he
said
i
am
going
to
lewis
i
shall
catch
the
train
to
glasgow
at
what
do
you
want
to
go
to
lewis
for
said
ingram
starting
up
you
think
sheila
would
go
straight
back
to
her
own
people
with
all
this
humiliation
upon
her
and
supposing
she
is
not
there
how
do
you
propose
to
meet
old
mackenzie
am
not
afraid
of
meeting
any
man
said
lavender
want
to
know
where
sheila
is
and
if
i
see
mackenzie
i
can
only
tell
him
frankly
everything
that
has
happened
he
is
not
likely
to
say
anything
of
me
half
as
bad
as
what
i
think
of
listen
said
ingram
sitting
up
in
bed
with
his
brown
beard
and
grayish
hair
in
a
considerably
disheveled
condition
may
have
gone
home
but
it
likely
if
she
has
not
your
taking
the
story
up
there
and
spreading
it
abroad
would
prepare
a
great
deal
of
pain
for
her
when
she
might
come
back
at
some
future
time
but
suppose
you
want
to
make
sure
that
she
has
not
gone
to
her
house
she
could
not
have
got
down
to
glasgow
sooner
than
this
morning
by
last
train
you
know
it
is
morning
not
this
morning
that
the
stornoway
steamer
starts
and
she
would
be
certain
to
go
direct
to
it
at
the
glasgow
broomielaw
and
go
around
the
mull
of
cantyre
instead
of
catching
it
up
at
oban
because
she
knows
the
people
in
the
boat
and
she
and
mairi
would
be
among
friends
if
you
really
want
to
know
whether
she
has
gone
north
perhaps
you
could
do
no
better
than
run
down
to
glasgow
and
have
a
look
at
the
boat
that
starts
morning
i
would
go
with
you
myself
but
i
escape
the
office
to
lavender
agreed
to
do
this
and
was
about
to
go
but
before
he
bade
his
friend
he
lingered
for
a
second
or
two
in
a
hesitating
way
and
then
he
said
you
were
speaking
the
other
night
of
your
going
up
to
borva
if
you
should
go
course
i
go
said
the
other
promptly
could
i
face
mackenzie
when
he
began
to
ask
me
about
sheila
no
i
can
not
go
to
borva
while
this
affair
remains
in
its
present
condition
and
indeed
lavender
i
mean
to
stop
in
london
till
i
see
you
out
of
your
trouble
are
heaping
coals
of
fire
on
my
look
at
it
that
way
if
i
can
be
of
any
help
to
you
i
shall
expect
this
time
to
have
a
return
for
do
you
mean
will
tell
you
when
we
get
to
know
something
of
and
so
frank
lavender
found
himself
once
more
as
in
the
old
times
in
the
euston
station
with
the
scotch
mail
ready
to
start
and
all
manner
of
folks
bustling
about
with
that
unnecessary
activity
which
betokens
the
excitement
of
a
holiday
what
a
strange
holiday
was
his
he
got
into
a
in
order
to
be
alone
and
he
looked
out
on
the
people
who
were
bidding
their
friends
some
of
them
were
not
very
pretty
many
of
them
were
ordinary
insignificant
commonplace
looking
folks
but
it
was
clear
that
they
had
those
about
them
who
loved
them
and
thought
much
of
them
there
was
one
man
whom
in
other
circumstances
lavender
would
have
dismissed
with
contempt
as
an
excellent
specimen
of
the
unmitigated
cad
he
wore
a
white
waistcoat
purple
gloves
and
a
green
knot
with
a
diamond
in
it
and
there
was
a
cheery
vacuous
smiling
expression
on
his
round
face
as
he
industriously
smoked
a
cheroot
and
made
small
jokes
to
the
friends
who
had
come
to
see
him
off
one
of
them
was
a
young
woman
not
very
perhaps
who
did
not
join
in
the
general
hilarity
and
it
occurred
to
lavender
that
the
jovial
man
with
the
cheroot
was
perhaps
cracking
his
little
jokes
to
keep
up
her
spirits
at
all
events
he
called
her
good
lass
from
time
to
time
and
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
and
was
very
kind
to
her
and
when
the
guard
came
up
and
bade
everybody
get
in
the
man
kissed
the
girl
and
shook
hands
with
her
and
bade
her
and
then
she
moved
by
some
sudden
impulse
caught
his
face
in
both
her
hands
and
kissed
him
once
on
each
cheek
it
was
a
ridiculous
scene
people
who
wear
green
ties
with
diamond
pins
care
nothing
for
decorum
and
yet
lavender
when
he
averted
his
eyes
from
this
parting
could
not
help
recalling
what
ingram
had
been
saying
the
night
before
and
wondered
whether
this
outrageous
person
with
his
abominable
decorations
and
his
genial
grin
might
not
be
more
fortunate
than
many
a
great
statesman
or
warrior
or
monarch
he
turned
around
to
find
the
cad
beside
him
and
presently
the
man
with
an
abounding
began
to
converse
with
him
and
explained
that
it
was
with
him
for
that
he
had
got
a
pass
to
travel
first
class
as
far
as
carlisle
he
hoped
they
would
have
a
jolly
time
of
it
together
he
explained
the
object
of
his
journey
in
the
frankest
possible
fashion
made
a
kindly
little
joke
upon
the
hardship
of
parting
with
sweetheart
said
that
a
faint
heart
never
won
fair
lady
and
that
it
was
no
good
crying
over
spilt
milk
she
would
be
all
right
and
precious
glad
to
see
him
when
he
came
back
in
three
time
and
he
meant
to
bring
her
a
present
that
would
be
good
for
sore
eyes
a
married
man
sir
and
got
past
all
them
games
said
the
cad
cheerily
i
am
married
said
lavender
coldly
going
further
than
carlisle
you
say
sir
be
sworn
the
good
lady
is
up
somewhere
in
that
direction
and
she
be
disappointed
when
she
sees
you
oh
no
scotch
sir
am
not
scotch
said
lavender
curtly
she
should
he
have
to
throw
the
man
out
of
the
window
scotch
are
a
strange
race
very
said
the
genial
person
producing
a
brandy
flask
drink
a
trifle
they
and
yet
they
keep
their
wits
about
them
if
dealings
with
them
a
very
strange
race
of
people
in
my
opinion
very
know
the
story
of
the
master
who
fancied
his
man
was
drunk
trunk
says
he
a
tam
lee
says
donald
ye
ken
trunk
says
the
master
ken
ah
wish
to
kott
ah
was
says
donald
good
story
it
sir
lavender
had
heard
the
remarkable
old
joke
a
hundred
times
but
just
at
this
moment
there
was
something
odd
in
this
vulgar
person
suddenly
imitating
and
imitating
very
well
the
highland
accent
had
he
been
way
up
in
the
north
or
had
he
merely
heard
the
story
related
by
one
who
had
been
lavender
dared
not
ask
however
for
fear
of
prolonging
a
conversation
in
which
he
had
no
wish
to
join
indeed
to
get
rid
of
the
man
he
shoved
a
whole
bundle
of
the
morning
papers
into
his
hand
your
opinion
of
politics
at
present
sir
observed
his
friend
in
an
way
any
said
lavender
compelled
to
take
back
one
of
the
newspapers
and
open
it
think
myself
in
a
bad
state
my
opinion
there
a
man
among
them
that
knows
how
to
keep
down
those
people
my
opinion
sir
what
do
you
think
i
think
so
too
said
lavender
find
a
good
article
in
that
paper
on
university
the
cheery
person
looked
rather
blank
would
like
to
hear
your
opinion
about
sir
he
said
much
good
reading
only
one
side
of
a
question
but
when
you
can
talk
about
and
discuss
it
now
am
sorry
i
oblige
you
said
lavender
goaded
into
making
some
desperate
effort
to
release
himself
am
suffering
from
a
relaxed
throat
at
present
my
doctor
has
warned
me
against
talking
too
beg
your
pardon
sir
you
seem
very
well
perhaps
the
throat
comes
with
a
little
feverishness
you
see
a
cold
in
fact
now
if
i
was
you
i
would
try
tannin
lozenges
for
the
throat
uncommon
good
for
the
throat
and
a
little
quinine
for
the
general
system
that
would
put
you
as
right
as
a
fiver
i
tried
it
myself
when
i
was
down
in
last
year
and
you
find
a
drop
of
this
brandy
a
bad
thing
either
if
you
mind
rowing
in
the
same
boat
as
lavender
declined
the
proffered
flask
and
subsided
behind
a
newspaper
his
lit
another
cheroot
took
up
bradshaw
and
settled
himself
in
a
corner
had
sheila
come
up
this
very
line
some
dozen
hours
before
lavender
asked
himself
as
he
looked
out
on
the
hills
and
valleys
and
woods
of
buckinghamshire
had
the
throbbing
of
the
engine
and
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
kept
the
piteous
eyes
awake
all
through
the
dark
night
until
the
pale
dawn
showed
the
girl
a
wild
vision
of
northern
hills
and
moors
telling
her
she
was
getting
nearer
to
her
own
country
not
thus
had
sheila
proposed
to
herself
to
return
home
on
the
first
holiday
time
that
should
occur
to
them
both
he
began
to
think
of
his
present
journey
as
it
might
have
been
in
other
circumstances
would
she
have
remembered
any
of
those
pretty
villages
which
she
saw
one
early
morning
long
ago
when
they
were
bathed
in
sunshine
and
scarcely
awake
to
the
new
day
would
she
be
impatient
at
the
delays
at
the
stations
and
anxious
to
hurry
on
to
westmoreland
and
dumfries
to
glasgow
and
oban
and
skye
and
then
from
stornoway
across
the
island
to
the
little
inn
at
here
as
he
looked
out
of
the
window
the
first
indication
of
the
wilder
country
became
visible
in
the
distant
berkshire
hills
close
at
hand
the
country
lay
green
and
bright
under
a
brilliant
sun
but
over
there
in
the
east
some
heavy
clouds
darkened
the
landscape
and
the
far
hills
seemed
to
be
placed
amid
a
gloomy
stretch
of
moorland
would
not
sheila
have
been
thrilled
by
this
glimpse
of
the
coming
north
she
would
have
fancied
that
greater
mountains
lay
far
behind
these
rounded
slopes
hidden
in
mist
she
would
have
imagined
that
no
human
habitations
were
near
those
rising
plains
of
sombre
hue
where
the
red
deer
and
the
fox
ought
to
dwell
and
in
her
delight
at
getting
away
from
the
fancied
brightness
of
the
south
would
she
not
have
been
exceptionally
grateful
and
affectionate
toward
himself
and
striven
to
please
him
with
her
tender
ways
it
was
not
a
cheerful
journey
this
lonely
trip
to
the
north
lavender
got
to
glasgow
that
night
and
next
morning
he
went
down
long
before
any
passengers
could
have
thought
of
arriving
to
the
clansman
he
did
not
go
near
the
big
steamer
for
he
was
known
to
the
captain
and
the
steward
but
he
hung
about
the
quays
watching
each
person
who
went
on
board
sheila
certainly
was
not
among
the
passengers
by
the
clansman
but
she
might
have
gone
to
greenock
and
waited
for
the
steamer
there
accordingly
after
the
clansman
had
started
on
her
voyage
he
went
into
a
neighboring
hotel
and
had
some
breakfast
after
which
he
crossed
the
bridge
to
the
station
and
took
rail
for
greenock
where
he
arrived
some
time
before
the
clansman
made
her
appearance
he
went
down
to
the
quay
it
was
yet
early
morning
and
a
cool
fresh
breeze
was
blowing
in
across
the
broad
waters
of
the
frith
where
the
sunlight
was
shining
on
the
white
sails
of
the
yachts
and
on
the
dipping
and
screaming
far
away
beyond
the
pale
blue
mountains
opposite
lay
the
wonderful
network
of
and
island
through
which
one
had
to
pass
to
get
to
the
distant
lewis
how
gladly
at
this
moment
would
he
have
stepped
on
board
the
steamer
with
sheila
and
put
out
on
that
gleaming
plain
of
sea
knowing
that
by
and
by
they
would
sail
into
stornoway
harbor
and
find
the
wagonette
there
they
would
not
hasten
the
voyage
she
had
never
been
around
the
mull
of
cantyre
and
so
he
would
sit
by
her
side
and
show
her
the
wild
tides
meeting
there
and
the
long
jets
of
white
foam
shooting
up
the
great
wall
of
rock
he
would
show
her
the
coast
of
ireland
and
then
they
would
see
islay
of
which
she
had
many
a
ballad
and
story
they
would
go
through
the
narrow
sound
that
is
overlooked
by
the
gloomy
mountains
of
jura
they
would
see
the
distant
islands
where
the
chief
of
colonsay
is
still
mourned
for
on
the
still
evenings
by
the
hapless
mermaiden
who
sings
her
wild
song
across
the
sea
they
would
keep
wide
of
the
dangerous
currents
of
corryvreckan
and
by
and
by
they
would
sail
into
the
harbor
of
oban
the
beautiful
where
sheila
first
got
a
notion
of
the
greatness
of
the
world
lying
outside
of
her
native
island
what
if
she
were
to
come
down
now
from
this
busy
little
seaport
which
lay
under
a
pale
blue
smoke
and
come
out
upon
this
pier
to
meet
the
free
sunlight
and
the
fresh
blowing
all
about
surely
at
a
great
distance
he
could
recognize
the
proud
light
step
and
the
proud
sad
face
would
she
speak
to
him
or
go
past
him
with
firm
lips
and
piteous
eyes
to
wait
for
the
great
steamer
that
was
now
coming
along
out
of
the
eastern
mist
lavender
glanced
vaguely
around
the
quays
and
the
thoroughfares
leading
to
them
but
there
was
no
one
like
sheila
there
in
the
distance
he
could
hear
the
throbbing
of
the
engines
as
the
big
steamer
came
on
through
the
white
plain
the
sun
was
warmer
now
on
the
bright
waters
of
the
frith
and
the
distant
haze
over
the
pale
blue
mountains
beyond
had
grown
more
luminous
small
boats
went
by
and
here
and
there
a
yachtsman
and
in
white
costume
was
taking
a
leisurely
breakfast
on
his
deck
the
circled
about
or
dipped
down
on
the
waters
or
chased
each
other
with
screams
and
cries
then
the
clansman
sailed
into
the
quay
and
there
was
a
flinging
of
ropes
and
general
hurry
and
bustle
while
people
came
crowding
around
the
gangways
calling
out
to
each
other
in
every
variety
of
dialect
and
accent
sheila
was
not
there
he
lingered
about
and
patiently
waited
for
the
starting
of
the
steamer
not
knowing
how
long
she
ordinarily
remained
in
greenock
he
was
in
no
hurry
indeed
for
after
the
vessel
had
gone
he
found
himself
with
a
whole
day
before
him
and
with
no
fixed
notion
as
to
how
it
could
be
passed
in
other
circumstances
he
would
have
been
in
no
difficulty
as
to
the
spending
of
a
bright
forenoon
and
afternoon
by
the
side
of
the
sea
or
he
could
have
run
through
to
edinburgh
and
called
on
some
artist
friends
there
or
he
could
have
crossed
the
frith
and
had
a
ramble
among
the
mountains
but
now
that
he
was
satisfied
that
sheila
had
not
gone
home
all
his
fancies
and
hopes
went
back
to
london
she
was
in
london
and
while
he
was
glad
that
she
had
not
gone
straight
to
her
own
people
with
a
revelation
of
her
wrongs
he
scarcely
dared
speculate
on
what
adventures
and
experiences
might
have
befallen
those
two
girls
turned
out
into
a
great
city
of
which
they
were
about
equally
ignorant
the
day
passed
somehow
and
at
night
he
was
on
his
way
to
london
next
morning
he
went
down
to
whitehall
and
saw
ingram
has
not
gone
back
to
the
highlands
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
he
said
much
the
better
was
the
answer
am
i
to
do
she
must
be
in
london
and
who
knows
what
may
befall
her
can
not
tell
you
what
you
should
do
of
course
you
would
like
to
know
where
she
is
and
i
fancy
she
would
have
no
objection
herself
to
letting
you
know
that
she
was
all
right
so
long
as
she
knew
that
you
would
not
go
near
her
i
think
she
has
taken
so
decided
a
step
merely
for
the
purpose
of
being
coaxed
back
again
that
is
not
go
near
her
he
said
only
want
to
know
that
she
is
safe
and
well
i
will
do
whatever
she
likes
but
i
must
know
where
she
is
and
that
she
has
come
to
no
said
ingram
slowly
was
talking
the
matter
over
with
lorraine
last
night
know
said
lavender
wincing
somewhat
ingram
answered
did
not
tell
her
i
had
promised
to
go
up
there
about
something
quite
different
when
she
immediately
began
to
tell
me
the
news
of
course
it
was
impossible
to
conceal
such
a
thing
all
the
servants
about
know
care
who
knows
said
lavender
moodily
does
lorraine
say
about
this
affair
lorraine
says
that
it
serves
you
right
said
ingram
bluntly
her
very
much
i
like
candor
especially
in
a
fair
weather
lorraine
is
a
better
friend
to
you
than
you
imagine
ingram
said
taking
no
notice
of
the
sneer
she
thought
that
your
going
to
their
house
continually
was
annoying
sheila
she
tried
to
put
a
stop
to
it
for
sake
and
now
at
this
very
moment
she
is
doing
her
very
best
to
find
out
where
sheila
is
and
if
she
succeeds
she
means
to
go
and
plead
your
cause
with
the
will
not
have
her
do
anything
of
the
kind
said
lavender
fiercely
will
plead
my
own
cause
with
sheila
i
will
have
forgiveness
from
sheila
herself
alone
not
brought
to
me
by
any
intermeddling
call
names
said
ingram
coolly
i
confess
i
think
you
are
right
and
i
told
lorraine
that
was
what
you
would
doubtless
say
in
any
case
she
can
do
no
harm
in
trying
to
find
out
where
sheila
how
does
she
propose
to
succeed
pollaky
the
column
placards
or
a
bellman
i
tell
you
ingram
i
have
that
woman
meddle
in
my
affairs
coming
forward
as
a
sister
of
mercy
to
heal
the
wounded
bestowing
mock
compassion
and
laughing
all
the
you
are
beside
yourself
that
woman
is
one
of
the
most
shrewd
clever
and
amiable
women
i
have
ever
met
what
has
enraged
you
got
hold
of
you
too
has
she
i
tell
you
she
is
a
rank
impostor
said
ingram
slowly
have
heard
a
good
many
people
called
impostors
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
the
blame
of
the
imposture
might
possibly
lie
with
the
person
imposed
on
i
have
heard
of
people
falling
into
the
delusion
that
a
certain
modest
and
man
was
a
great
politician
or
a
great
wit
although
he
had
never
claimed
to
be
anything
of
the
kind
and
then
when
they
found
out
that
in
truth
he
was
just
what
he
had
pretended
to
be
they
called
out
against
him
as
an
impostor
i
have
heard
too
of
young
gentlemen
accusing
women
of
imposture
whose
only
crime
was
that
they
did
not
possess
qualities
which
they
had
never
pretended
to
possess
but
which
the
young
gentlemen
fancied
they
ought
to
possess
lorraine
may
be
an
impostor
to
you
i
think
she
is
a
thoroughly
good
woman
and
i
know
she
is
a
very
delightful
companion
and
if
you
want
to
know
how
she
means
to
find
sheila
out
i
can
tell
you
she
thinks
that
sheila
would
probably
go
to
a
hotel
but
that
afterward
she
would
try
to
find
lodgings
with
some
of
the
people
whom
she
had
got
to
know
through
her
giving
them
assistance
lorraine
would
like
to
ask
your
servants
about
the
women
who
used
to
come
for
this
help
then
she
thinks
sheila
would
probably
get
some
one
of
these
humble
friends
to
call
for
her
letters
for
she
would
like
to
hear
from
her
father
and
she
would
not
care
to
tell
him
that
she
had
left
your
house
there
is
a
great
deal
of
supposition
in
all
this
but
lorraine
is
a
shrewd
woman
and
i
would
trust
to
her
instinct
in
such
matters
a
long
way
she
is
quite
sure
that
sheila
would
be
too
proud
to
tell
her
father
and
very
much
averse
also
to
inflicting
so
severe
a
blow
on
surely
lavender
said
hastily
sheila
wishes
to
conceal
this
affair
for
a
time
she
must
believe
it
to
be
only
temporary
she
can
not
propose
to
make
the
separation
final
i
know
anything
about
i
would
advise
you
to
go
and
see
go
and
see
this
is
unreasonable
lavender
you
begin
to
fancy
that
sheila
had
some
sort
of
dislike
to
lorraine
founded
on
ignorance
and
straightway
you
think
it
is
your
duty
to
go
and
hate
the
woman
whatever
you
may
think
of
her
she
is
willing
to
do
you
a
you
go
ingram
and
take
her
to
those
servants
i
will
if
you
commission
me
to
do
so
said
ingram
readily
suppose
they
all
know
every
one
else
should
think
few
of
your
friends
would
remain
in
ignorance
of
well
said
lavender
only
i
could
get
sheila
to
overlook
what
is
past
this
once
i
should
not
trouble
my
dear
friends
and
acquaintances
for
their
sympathy
and
condolence
by
the
time
i
saw
them
again
i
fancy
they
would
have
forgotten
our
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
fact
that
the
news
of
flight
from
her
house
had
traveled
very
speedily
around
the
circle
of
friends
and
doubtless
in
due
time
it
reached
the
ears
of
his
aunt
at
all
events
mrs
lavender
sent
a
message
to
ingram
asking
him
to
come
and
see
her
when
he
went
he
found
the
little
dry
woman
in
a
terrible
passion
she
had
forgotten
all
about
marcus
aurelius
and
the
composure
of
a
philosopher
and
the
effect
of
anger
on
the
nervous
system
she
was
bolstered
up
in
bed
for
she
had
had
another
bad
fit
but
she
was
brisk
enough
in
her
manner
and
fierce
enough
in
her
language
ingram
she
said
the
moment
he
had
entered
you
consider
my
nephew
a
beast
he
said
do
she
retorted
you
are
quite
mistaken
mrs
lavender
probably
you
have
heard
some
exaggerated
story
of
all
this
business
he
has
been
very
inconsiderate
and
thoughtless
certainly
but
i
believe
he
quite
knew
how
sensitive
his
wife
was
and
he
is
very
repentant
now
and
i
know
he
will
keep
his
would
apologize
for
the
devil
said
the
little
old
woman
frowning
would
try
to
give
him
his
due
at
all
events
said
ingram
with
a
laugh
know
frank
lavender
very
well
i
have
known
him
for
years
and
i
know
there
is
good
stuff
in
him
which
may
be
developed
in
proper
circumstances
after
all
what
is
there
more
common
than
for
a
married
man
to
neglect
his
wife
he
only
did
unconsciously
and
thoughtlessly
what
heaps
of
men
do
are
making
me
angry
said
mrs
lavender
in
a
severe
voice
think
it
fair
to
expect
men
to
be
demigods
ingram
said
carelessly
never
met
any
demigods
myself
they
live
in
my
neighborhood
perhaps
if
i
had
had
some
experience
of
a
batch
of
them
i
should
be
more
censorious
of
other
people
if
you
set
up
frank
for
a
bayard
is
it
his
fault
or
yours
am
not
going
to
be
talked
out
of
my
common
sense
and
me
on
my
said
the
old
lady
impatiently
and
yet
with
some
secret
hope
that
ingram
would
go
on
talking
and
amuse
her
have
you
say
he
is
anything
but
a
stupid
and
ungrateful
boy
who
married
a
wife
far
too
good
for
him
he
is
worse
than
that
he
is
much
worse
than
that
but
as
this
may
be
my
i
will
keep
a
civil
tongue
in
my
thought
you
like
his
wife
very
much
said
ingram
am
not
bound
to
like
her
because
i
think
badly
of
him
am
i
she
was
not
a
bad
sort
of
a
girl
after
all
temper
a
little
stiff
perhaps
but
she
was
honest
it
did
eyes
good
to
look
at
her
bright
face
yes
she
was
a
good
sort
of
a
creature
in
her
way
but
when
she
ran
off
from
him
why
she
come
to
me
you
never
encouraged
where
ought
a
married
woman
go
to
but
to
her
relatives
if
she
can
not
stay
with
him
let
her
take
the
next
best
substitute
it
was
her
duty
to
come
to
sheila
had
fancied
it
to
be
her
duty
she
would
have
come
here
at
any
do
you
mean
ingram
said
mrs
lavender
severely
supposing
she
like
you
he
was
beginning
to
say
cautiously
when
she
sharply
interrupted
him
like
me
eh
said
nothing
of
the
kind
i
was
about
to
say
that
if
she
had
thought
it
her
duty
to
come
here
she
would
have
come
in
any
might
have
done
worse
a
young
woman
risks
a
great
deal
in
running
away
from
her
home
people
will
talk
who
is
to
make
people
believe
just
the
version
of
the
story
that
the
husband
or
the
wife
would
prefer
what
does
sheila
care
said
ingram
with
a
hot
flush
in
his
face
the
belief
of
a
lot
of
idle
gossips
and
slanderers
dear
ingram
said
the
old
lady
are
not
a
woman
and
you
know
the
bother
one
has
to
look
after
reputation
but
that
is
a
question
not
likely
to
interest
you
let
us
talk
of
something
else
do
you
know
why
i
wanted
you
to
come
and
see
me
am
sure
i
mean
to
leave
you
all
my
he
stared
she
did
not
appear
to
be
joking
was
it
possible
that
her
rage
against
her
nephew
had
carried
her
to
this
extreme
resolve
he
stammered
i
have
it
have
to
have
it
said
the
little
old
woman
severely
are
a
poor
man
you
could
make
good
use
of
my
money
better
than
a
charity
board
that
would
starve
the
poor
with
a
penny
out
of
each
shilling
and
spend
the
other
elevenpence
in
treating
their
friends
to
and
dinners
do
you
think
i
mean
to
leave
my
money
to
such
people
you
shall
have
it
i
think
you
would
look
very
well
driving
a
in
the
park
and
i
suppose
you
would
give
up
your
pipes
and
your
philosophy
and
your
bachelor
walks
into
the
country
you
would
marry
of
course
every
man
is
bound
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
that
way
as
soon
as
he
gets
money
enough
to
do
it
with
but
perhaps
you
might
come
across
a
clever
and
sensible
woman
who
would
look
after
you
and
give
you
your
own
way
while
having
her
own
only
marry
a
fool
whatever
you
do
marry
a
fool
or
all
your
philosophers
make
the
house
bearable
to
am
not
likely
to
marry
anybody
lavender
said
ingram
carelessly
there
no
woman
you
know
whom
you
would
care
to
marry
he
said
is
one
woman
yes
who
seems
to
me
about
everything
a
man
could
wish
but
the
notion
of
my
marrying
her
is
absurd
if
i
had
known
in
time
you
see
that
i
should
ever
think
of
such
a
thing
i
should
have
begun
years
ago
to
dye
my
hair
i
begin
now
gray
hair
inspires
reverence
i
believe
but
it
is
a
bad
thing
to
go
courting
must
not
talk
foolishly
said
the
little
old
lady
with
a
frown
you
think
a
sensible
woman
wants
to
marry
a
boy
who
will
torment
her
with
his
folly
and
his
empty
head
and
his
running
after
a
dozen
different
women
gray
hair
if
you
think
gray
hair
is
a
bad
thing
to
go
courting
with
i
will
give
you
something
better
i
will
put
something
in
your
head
that
will
make
the
young
lady
forget
your
gray
hair
oh
of
course
you
will
say
that
she
can
not
be
tempted
and
that
she
despises
money
if
so
how
much
the
better
but
i
have
known
more
women
than
you
and
my
hair
is
grayer
than
yours
and
you
will
find
that
a
little
money
stand
in
the
way
of
your
being
he
had
made
some
gesture
of
protest
not
against
her
speaking
of
the
possible
marriage
which
scarcely
interested
him
so
remote
was
the
possibility
but
against
her
returning
to
this
other
proposal
and
when
he
saw
the
old
woman
really
meant
to
do
this
thing
he
found
it
necessary
to
declare
himself
explicitly
on
the
point
imagine
lavender
he
said
i
have
any
wild
horror
of
money
or
that
i
suppose
any
one
else
would
have
i
should
like
to
have
five
times
or
ten
times
as
much
as
you
seem
generously
disposed
to
give
me
but
here
is
the
point
you
see
i
am
a
vain
person
i
am
very
proud
of
my
own
opinion
of
myself
and
if
i
acceded
to
what
you
propose
if
i
took
your
money
i
suppose
i
should
be
driving
about
in
that
fine
phæton
you
speak
of
that
is
very
good
i
like
driving
and
i
should
be
pleased
with
the
appearance
of
the
trap
and
the
horses
but
what
do
you
fancy
i
should
think
of
myself
what
would
be
my
opinion
of
my
own
nobleness
and
generosity
and
humanity
if
i
saw
sheila
mackenzie
walking
by
on
the
pavement
without
any
carriage
to
drive
in
perhaps
without
a
notion
as
to
where
she
was
going
to
get
her
dinner
i
should
be
a
great
hero
to
myself
then
i
sheila
again
said
the
old
woman
in
a
tone
of
vexation
imagine
what
there
is
in
that
girl
to
make
men
rave
so
about
her
that
is
become
a
thorough
nuisance
you
would
fancy
she
had
just
stepped
down
out
of
the
clouds
to
present
him
with
a
gold
harp
and
that
he
look
up
to
her
face
and
are
you
just
as
bad
you
are
worse
for
you
blow
it
off
in
steam
well
there
need
be
no
difficulty
i
meant
to
leave
the
girl
in
your
charge
you
take
the
money
and
look
after
her
i
know
she
starve
take
it
in
trust
for
her
if
you
that
is
a
fearful
responsibility
lavender
he
said
in
dismay
is
a
married
woman
her
husband
is
the
proper
person
tell
you
i
give
him
a
farthing
she
said
with
a
sudden
sharpness
that
startled
him
a
farthing
if
he
wants
money
let
him
work
for
it
as
other
people
do
and
then
when
he
has
done
that
if
he
is
to
have
any
of
my
money
he
must
be
beholden
for
it
to
his
wife
and
to
you
think
that
sheila
would
accept
anything
that
she
would
not
immediately
hand
over
to
him
he
must
come
first
to
have
no
wish
to
inflict
humiliation
on
any
one
said
ingram
stiffly
want
to
play
the
part
of
a
little
providence
and
mete
out
punishment
in
that
way
i
might
have
to
begin
with
be
foolish
said
the
old
lady
with
a
menacing
composure
give
you
fair
warning
the
next
fit
will
do
for
me
if
you
care
to
take
my
money
and
keep
it
in
trust
for
this
girl
you
profess
to
care
so
much
about
i
will
leave
it
to
found
an
institution
mind
you
i
mean
to
teach
people
what
they
should
eat
and
drink
and
the
various
effects
of
food
on
various
is
an
important
subject
ingram
admitted
it
not
what
is
the
use
of
giving
people
laborious
information
about
the
idle
fancies
of
generations
that
lived
ages
before
they
were
born
while
you
are
letting
them
poison
their
system
and
lay
up
for
themselves
a
fearfully
painful
old
age
by
the
continuous
use
of
unsuitable
food
that
book
you
gave
me
ingram
is
a
wonderful
book
but
it
gives
you
little
consolation
if
you
know
another
fit
is
coming
on
and
what
is
the
good
of
knowing
about
epictetus
and
zeno
and
the
rest
if
got
rheumatism
now
i
mean
to
have
classes
to
teach
people
what
they
should
eat
and
drink
and
do
it
if
you
assume
the
guardianship
of
my
this
is
the
wildest
notion
i
ever
heard
of
ingram
protested
again
can
i
take
charge
of
her
if
sheila
herself
had
shown
any
disposition
to
place
herself
under
your
care
it
might
have
been
it
would
have
been
different
cried
the
old
lady
with
a
shrill
laugh
would
have
been
different
and
what
did
you
say
about
her
sense
of
duty
to
her
relatives
did
you
say
anything
about
that
ingram
was
about
to
say
being
lost
in
amazement
at
the
odd
glee
of
this
withered
old
creature
do
you
think
a
young
wife
should
go
if
she
runs
off
from
her
house
cried
mrs
lavender
apparently
much
amused
by
his
perplexity
can
she
best
escape
calumny
poor
man
i
frighten
you
or
disturb
you
any
longer
ring
the
bell
will
you
i
want
ingram
rang
said
mrs
lavender
when
the
tall
and
grave
woman
appeared
mrs
lavender
if
she
can
come
here
for
a
few
ingram
looked
at
the
old
woman
to
see
if
she
had
gone
mad
and
then
somehow
he
instinctively
turned
to
the
door
he
fancied
he
knew
that
quick
light
step
and
then
before
he
well
knew
how
sheila
had
come
forward
to
him
with
her
hands
outstretched
and
with
something
like
a
smile
on
her
pale
face
she
looked
at
him
for
a
second
she
tried
to
speak
to
him
but
there
was
a
dangerous
quivering
of
the
lips
and
then
she
suddenly
burst
into
tears
and
let
go
his
hands
and
turned
away
in
that
brief
moment
he
had
seen
what
havoc
had
been
wrought
within
the
past
two
or
three
days
there
were
the
same
proud
and
handsome
features
but
they
were
pale
and
worn
and
there
was
a
piteous
and
weary
look
in
the
eyes
that
told
of
the
trouble
and
of
sleepless
nights
he
said
following
her
and
taking
her
hand
any
one
know
of
your
being
here
she
said
still
holding
her
head
aside
and
downcast
one
and
i
do
not
wish
any
one
to
know
i
am
going
you
ask
too
much
ingram
said
the
old
lady
from
amid
her
cushions
and
curtains
her
that
ammonia
the
stopper
only
now
sit
down
child
and
dry
your
eyes
you
need
not
be
ashamed
to
show
ingram
that
you
knew
where
you
ought
to
come
when
you
left
your
house
and
if
you
stop
here
of
course
i
compel
you
though
ingram
will
tell
you
you
might
do
why
do
you
wish
to
go
away
do
you
mean
to
go
back
to
the
lewis
no
no
she
said
almost
shuddering
do
you
wish
to
go
it
does
not
matter
but
i
can
not
remain
here
i
should
meet
with
with
many
people
i
used
to
know
mrs
lavender
she
is
kind
enough
to
say
she
will
get
me
some
place
for
mairi
and
me
that
is
all
as
yet
that
is
mairi
with
you
i
will
go
and
bring
her
to
you
it
is
not
any
one
in
london
she
will
want
to
see
as
much
as
sheila
left
the
room
and
by
and
by
came
back
leading
the
young
highland
girl
by
the
hand
mairi
was
greatly
embarrassed
scarcely
knowing
whether
she
should
show
any
gladness
at
meeting
this
old
friend
amid
so
much
trouble
but
when
ingram
shook
hands
with
her
and
after
she
had
blushed
and
looked
shy
and
said
are
you
ferry
well
sir
she
managed
somehow
to
lift
her
eyes
to
his
face
and
then
she
said
suddenly
it
is
a
good
day
this
day
for
miss
sheila
that
you
will
come
to
see
her
ingram
for
she
will
hef
a
friend
silly
girl
said
mrs
lavender
sharply
will
you
say
sheila
you
know
she
is
a
married
woman
mairi
glanced
in
a
nervous
and
timid
manner
toward
the
bed
she
was
evidently
afraid
of
the
little
shrivelled
old
woman
with
the
staring
black
eyes
and
the
harsh
voice
forgotten
her
old
habits
that
is
all
said
ingram
patting
her
on
the
head
and
then
he
sat
down
again
and
it
seemed
so
strange
to
see
these
two
together
again
and
to
hear
the
odd
inflection
of
voice
that
he
almost
forgot
that
he
had
made
a
great
discovery
in
learning
of
whereabouts
and
wholly
forgot
that
he
had
just
been
offered
and
had
just
refused
a
fortune
chapter

meeting
and
parting
the
appearance
of
sheila
in
house
certainly
surprised
ingram
but
the
motives
which
led
her
to
go
thither
were
simple
enough
on
the
morning
on
which
she
had
left
her
house
she
and
mairi
had
been
driven
up
to
euston
square
station
before
she
seemed
capable
of
coming
to
any
decision
mairi
guessed
at
what
had
happened
with
a
great
fear
at
her
heart
and
did
not
dare
to
speak
of
it
she
sat
mute
and
frightened
in
a
corner
of
the
cab
and
only
glanced
from
time
to
time
at
her
pale
face
and
troubled
and
distant
eyes
they
were
driven
in
to
the
station
sheila
got
out
still
seeming
to
know
nothing
of
what
was
around
her
the
cabman
took
down
trunk
and
handed
it
to
a
porter
for
miss
said
the
man
and
she
started
will
you
be
going
miss
sheila
said
mairi
timidly
is
no
matter
just
now
said
sheila
to
the
porter
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
take
charge
of
the
trunk
and
how
much
must
i
pay
the
cabman
from
notting
hill
she
gave
him
the
money
and
walked
into
the
great
hall
with
its
lofty
roof
and
sounding
echoes
she
said
have
gone
away
from
my
own
home
and
i
have
no
home
for
you
or
myself
either
what
are
we
to

said
the
girl
dismayed
beyond
expression

own
house

a
bad
day
this
day
that

mairi
began
to
cry

to

said

sheila

not

sheila
looked
at
the
girl
at
the
pretty
pale
face
the
troubled
eyes
and
the
abundant
hair
it
was
mairi
sure
enough
who
was
talking
to
her
and
yet
it
was
in
a
strange
place
there
was
no
sea
dashing
outside
no
tide
running
in
from
the
atlantic
and
where
was
old
scarlett
with
her
complaints
and
her
petulance
and
her
motherly
kindness
is
a
pity
you
have
come
to
london
mairi
sheila
said
wistfully
i
have
no
house

take
you
into
and
we
must
go

and
find
will
not
go
back
to

in
the
lewis

more
mairi
i
have
been
too
long
away
and
i
am
quite
changed
it
is
many
a
time
i
will
think
of
going
back
but
when
i
left
the
lewis
i
was
married
and
now
how
could
i
go
back
to
the
lewis
mairi
they
would
look
at
me
they
would
ask
questions
my
father
would
come
down
to
the
quay
and
he
would
say
have
you
come
back
alone
and
all
the
story
of
it
would
go
about
the
island
and
every
one
would
say
i
had
been
a
bad
wife
and
my
husband
had
gone
away
from
is
not
any
one
said
mairi
with
the
tears
starting
to
her
eyes
again
from
one
end
of
sa
island
to
sa
other
would
say
that
of
you
miss
sheila
and
there
is
no
one
would
not
come
to
meet
you
and
be
glad
sat
you
will
come
again
to
your
own
home
and
as
for
going
back
i
will
be
ferry
glad
to
go
back
whatever
for
it
was
you
i
was
come
to
see
and
not
any
town
and
i
do
not
like
this
town
what
i
hef
seen
of
it
and
i
will
be
ferry
glad
to
go
away
wis
you
miss
sheila
did
not
answer
she
felt
that
it
was
impossible
she
could
go
back
to
her
own
people
with
this
disgrace
upon
her
and
did
not
even
argue
the
case
with
herself
all
her
trouble
now
was
to
find
some
harbor
of
refuge
into
which
she
could
flee
so
that
she
might
have
quiet
and
solitude
and
an
opportunity
of
studying
all
that
had
befallen
her
the
noise
around
her
the
arrival
of
travelers
the
transference
of
luggage
the
screaming
of
trains
stunned
and
confused
her
and
she
could
only
vaguely
think
of
all
the
people
she
knew
in
london
to
see
to
whom
she
could
go
for
advice
and
direction
they
were
not
many
one
after
the
other
she
went
over
the
acquaintances
she
had
made
and
not
one
of
them
appeared
to
her
in
the
light
of
a
friend
one
friend
she
had
who
would
have
rejoiced
to
be
of
the
least
assistance
to
her
but
her
husband
had
forbidden
her
to
hold
communication
with
him
and
she
felt
a
strange
sort
of
pride
even
at
this
moment
in
resolving
to
obey
that
injunction
in
all
this
great
city
that
lay
around
her
there
was
no
other
to
whom
she
could
frankly
and
readily
go
that
one
friend
she
had
possessed
before
she
came
to
london
in
london
she
had
not
made
another
and
yet
it
was
necessary
to
do
something
for
who
could
tell
but
that
her
husband
might
come
to
this
station
in
search
of
her
anxiety
too
was
increasing
every
moment
insomuch
that
she
was
fairly
trembling
with
excitement
and
fatigue
sheila
resolved
that
she
would
go
down
and
throw
herself
on
the
tender
mercies
of
that
terrible
old
lady
in
kensington
gore
for
one
thing
she
instinctively
sought
the
help
of
a
woman
in
her
present
plight
and
perhaps
this
old
lady
would
be
gentle
to
her
when
all
her
story
was
told
another
thing
that
prompted
this
decision
was
a
sort
of
secret
wish
to
identify
herself
even
yet
with
her
family
to
prove
to
herself
as
it
were
that
they
had
not
cast
her
off
as
being
unworthy
of
him
nothing
was
farther
from
her
mind
at
this
moment
than
any
desire
to
pave
the
way
for
reconciliation
and
reunion
with
her
husband
her
whole
anxiety
was
to
get
away
from
him
to
put
an
end
to
a
state
of
things
which
she
had
found
to
be
more
than
she
could
bear
and
yet
if
she
had
had
friends
in
london
called
respectively
mackenzie
and
lavender
and
if
she
had
been
equally
intimate
with
both
she
would
at
this
moment
have
preferred
to
go
for
help
to
those
bearing
the
name
of
lavender
there
was
doubtless
something
strangely
inconsistent
in
this
instinct
of
wifely
loyalty
and
duty
in
a
woman
who
had
just
voluntarily
left
her
house
lavender
had
desired
her
not
to
hold
communication
with
edward
ingram
even
now
she
would
respect
his
wish
lavender
would
prefer
that
she
should
in
any
great
extremity
go
to
his
aunt
for
assistance
and
counsel
and
to
his
aunt
despite
her
own
dislike
of
the
woman
she
would
go
at
this
moment
when
proud
spirit
had
risen
up
in
revolt
against
a
system
of
treatment
that
had
become
insufferable
to
her
when
she
had
been
forced
to
leave
her
home
and
incur
the
contemptuous
compassion
of
friends
and
acquaintances
if
edward
ingram
himself
had
happened
to
meet
her
and
had
begun
to
say
sharp
things
of
lavender
she
would
have
sharply
recalled
him
to
a
sense
of
discretion
that
one
must
use
in
speaking
to
a
wife
of
her
husband
the
two
homeless
girls
got
into
another
cab
and
were
driven
down
to
kensington
gore
sheila
asked
if
she
could
see
mrs
lavender
she
knew
that
the
old
lady
had
had
another
bad
fit
but
she
was
supposed
to
be
recovering
rapidly
mrs
lavender
would
see
her
in
her
bedroom
and
so
sheila
went
up
the
girl
could
not
speak
i
see
it
something
wrong
about
that
precious
husband
of
yours
said
the
old
lady
watching
her
keenly
expected
it
go
on
what
is
the
matter
have
left
him
sheila
said
with
her
face
very
pale
but
no
sign
of
emotion
about
the
firm
lips
good
gracious
child
left
him
how
many
people
know
it
one
but
yourself
and
a
young
highland
girl
who
has
come
up
to
see
came
to
me
first
of
all
you
no
other
friends
to
go
to
considered
that
i
ought
to
come
to
there
was
no
cunning
in
the
speech
it
was
the
simple
truth
mrs
lavender
looked
at
her
hard
for
a
second
or
two
and
then
said
in
what
she
meant
to
be
a
kind
way
here
and
sit
down
child
and
tell
me
all
about
it
if
no
one
else
knows
it
there
is
no
harm
done
we
can
easily
patch
it
up
before
it
gets
did
not
come
to
you
for
that
lavender
said
sheila
calmly
is
impossible
that
is
all
over
i
have
come
to
ask
you
where
i
can
get
lodgings
for
my
friend
and
me
all
about
it
first
and
then
see
whether
it
be
mended
mind
i
am
on
your
side
though
i
am
your
aunt
i
think
a
good
girl
a
bit
of
a
temper
you
know
but
you
manage
to
keep
it
quiet
ordinarily
you
tell
me
all
about
it
and
see
if
i
means
to
bring
him
to
reason
oh
yes
oh
yes
an
old
woman
but
i
can
find
some
means
to
bring
him
to
and
she
laughed
an
odd
shrill
laugh
a
hot
flush
came
over
face
had
she
come
to
this
old
woman
only
to
make
her
degradation
more
complete
was
he
to
be
intimidated
into
making
friends
with
her
by
a
threat
of
the
withdrawal
of
that
money
that
sheila
had
begun
to
detest
and
this
was
what
her
notions
of
wifely
duty
had
led
to
lavender
she
said
with
the
proud
lips
very
proud
indeed
must
say
this
to
you
before
i
tell
you
anything
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
say
you
will
take
my
side
but
i
did
not
come
to
you
to
complain
and
i
would
rather
not
have
any
sympathy
from
you
if
it
only
means
that
you
will
speak
ill
of
my
husband
and
if
you
think
you
can
make
him
do
things
because
you
give
him
money
perhaps
that
is
true
at
present
but
it
may
not
always
be
true
and
you
can
not
expect
me
to
wish
it
to
continue
i
would
rather
have
my
present
trouble
twenty
times
over
than
see
him
being
brought
over
to
any
mrs
lavender
stared
at
her
you
astonishing
girl
i
believe
you
are
still
in
love
with
that
man
sheila
said
nothing
it
true
she
said
suppose
a
woman
ought
to
love
her
husband
sheila
answered
if
he
turns
her
out
of
the
house
it
is
she
who
is
to
blame
sheila
said
humbly
her
education
was
wrong
or
she
expects
too
much
that
is
unreasonable
or
perhaps
she
has
a
bad
temper
you
think
i
have
a
bad
temper
mrs
lavender
and
might
it
not
be
that
i
think
you
want
your
own
way
and
doubtless
you
expect
to
have
it
now
i
suppose
i
am
to
listen
to
all
your
story
and
i
must
not
say
a
word
about
my
own
nephew
but
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
about
it
and
then
you
can
justify
him
afterward
if
you
like
it
was
probably
however
the
notion
that
sheila
would
try
to
justify
lavender
all
through
that
put
the
old
lady
on
her
guard
and
made
her
indeed
regard
conduct
in
an
unfairly
bad
light
sheila
told
the
story
as
simply
as
she
could
putting
everything
down
to
her
advantage
that
was
possible
and
asking
for
no
sympathy
whatsoever
she
only
wanted
to
remain
away
from
his
house
and
by
what
means
could
she
and
this
young
cousin
of
hers
find
cheap
lodgings
where
they
could
live
quietly
and
without
much
fear
of
detection
mrs
lavender
was
in
a
rage
and
as
she
was
not
allowed
to
vent
it
on
the
proper
object
she
turned
upon
sheila
herself
highlanders
are
a
proud
race
she
said
sharply
should
have
thought
that
rooms
in
this
house
even
with
the
society
of
a
cantankerous
old
woman
would
have
been
tolerated
for
a
is
very
kind
of
you
to
make
the
offer
sheila
said
i
do
not
wish
to
have
to
meet
my
husband
or
any
of
his
friends
there
is
enough
trouble
without
that
if
you
could
tell
me
where
to
get
lodgings
not
far
from
this
neighborhood
i
would
come
to
see
you
sometimes
at
such
hours
as
i
know
he
can
not
be
i
understand
what
you
mean
you
go
back
to
your
husband
although
i
could
manage
that
for
you
directly
you
hear
of
negotiations
or
of
any
prospect
of
your
going
back
and
yet
you
go
home
to
your
can
not
do
either
sheila
said
you
mean
to
live
in
these
lodging
always
can
i
tell
said
the
girl
piteously
only
wish
to
be
away
and
i
can
not
go
back
to
my
papa
with
all
this
story
to
tell
i
want
to
distress
you
said
the
old
woman
know
your
own
affairs
best
i
think
you
are
mad
if
you
would
calmly
reason
with
yourself
and
show
to
yourself
that
in
a
hundred
years
or
less
than
that
it
matter
whether
you
gratified
your
pride
or
no
you
would
see
that
the
wisest
thing
you
can
do
now
is
to
take
an
easy
and
comfortable
course
you
are
in
an
excited
and
nervous
state
at
present
for
example
and
that
is
destroying
so
much
of
the
vital
portion
of
your
frame
if
you
go
into
these
lodgings
and
live
like
a
rat
in
a
hole
you
will
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
nurse
these
sorrows
of
yours
and
find
them
grow
bigger
and
bigger
while
you
grow
more
and
more
wretched
all
that
is
mere
pride
and
sentiment
and
folly
on
the
other
hand
look
at
this
your
husband
is
sorry
you
are
away
from
him
you
may
take
that
for
granted
you
say
he
was
merely
thoughtless
now
he
has
got
something
to
make
him
think
and
would
without
doubt
come
and
beg
your
pardon
if
you
gave
him
a
chance
i
write
to
him
he
comes
down
here
you
kiss
and
make
good
friends
again
and
morning
you
are
comfortable
and
happy
again
morning
said
sheila
sadly
you
know
how
we
should
be
situated
morning
the
story
of
my
going
away
would
become
known
to
his
friends
he
would
go
among
them
as
though
he
had
suffered
some
disgrace
and
i
the
cause
of
it
and
though
he
is
a
man
and
would
soon
be
careless
of
that
how
could
i
go
with
him
amongst
his
friends
and
feel
that
i
had
shamed
him
it
would
be
worse
than
ever
between
us
and
i
have
no
wish
to
begin
again
what
ended
this
morning
none
at
all
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
intend
to
live
permanently
apart
from
your
husband
do
not
know
said
sheila
in
a
despairing
tone
can
not
tell
you
what
i
feel
is
that
with
all
this
trouble
it
is
better
that
our
life
as
it
was
in
that
house
should
come
to
an
then
she
arose
there
was
a
tired
look
about
the
face
as
if
she
were
too
weary
to
care
whether
this
old
woman
would
help
her
or
no
mrs
lavender
regarded
her
for
a
moment
wondering
perhaps
that
a
girl
so
handsome
and
should
be
distressing
herself
with
imaginary
sentiments
instead
of
taking
life
cheerfully
enjoying
the
hour
as
it
passed
and
being
quite
assured
of
the
interest
and
liking
and
homage
of
every
one
with
whom
she
came
in
contact
sheila
turned
to
the
bed
once
more
about
to
say
that
she
had
troubled
mrs
lavender
too
much
already
and
that
she
would
look
after
these
lodgings
but
the
old
woman
apparently
anticipated
as
much
and
said
with
much
deliberation
that
if
sheila
and
her
companion
would
only
remain
one
or
two
days
in
the
house
proper
rooms
should
be
provided
for
them
somewhere
young
girls
could
not
venture
into
lodgings
without
strict
inquiries
being
made
sheila
should
have
suitable
rooms
and
mrs
lavender
would
see
that
she
was
properly
looked
after
and
that
she
wanted
for
nothing
in
the
meantime
she
must
have
some
money
is
kind
of
you
said
the
girl
blushing
hotly
i
do
not
require
i
suppose
we
are
too
proud
said
the
old
woman
we
disapprove
of
our
husband
taking
money
we
must
not
do
it
either
why
child
you
have
learnt
nothing
in
london
you
are
a
savage
yet
you
must
let
me
give
you
something
for
your
pocket
or
what
are
you
to
do
you
say
you
have
left
everything
at
home
do
you
think
hairbrushes
for
example
grow
on
trees
that
you
can
go
into
kensington
gardens
and
stock
your
rooms
have
some
money
a
few
pounds
that
my
papa
gave
me
sheila
said
when
that
is
done
will
give
me
yet
you
wish
him
to
know
you
have
left
your
house
what
will
he
make
of
these
repeated
demands
for
money
papa
will
give
me
anything
i
want
without
asking
any
he
is
a
bigger
fool
than
i
expected
oh
get
into
a
temper
again
those
sudden
shocks
of
color
child
show
me
that
your
heart
is
out
of
order
how
can
you
expect
to
have
a
regular
pulsation
if
you
flare
up
at
anything
one
may
say
now
go
and
fetch
me
your
highland
mairi
came
into
the
room
in
a
very
timid
fashion
and
stared
with
her
big
eyes
into
the
dusky
recess
in
which
the
little
old
woman
sat
up
in
bed
sheila
took
her
forward
is
my
cousin
mairi
are
you
ferry
well
said
mairi
holding
out
her
hand
very
much
as
a
boy
pretends
to
hold
out
his
hand
to
a
tiger
in
the
zoological
gardens
young
lady
said
mrs
lavender
staring
at
her
a
pretty
mess
you
have
got
us
into
said
mairi
almost
with
a
cry
of
pain
she
had
not
imagined
before
that
she
had
anything
to
do
with
trouble
no
mairi
her
companion
said
taking
her
hand
was
not
you
mrs
lavender
mairi
does
not
understand
our
way
of
joking
in
london
perhaps
she
will
learn
before
she
goes
back
to
the
is
one
thing
said
mrs
lavender
observing
that
eyes
had
filled
the
moment
she
was
charged
with
bringing
trouble
on
sheila
is
one
thing
you
people
from
the
highlands
seem
never
disposed
to
learn
and
that
is
to
have
a
little
control
over
your
passions
if
one
speaks
to
you
a
couple
of
words
you
either
begin
to
cry
or
go
off
into
a
flash
of
rage
you
know
how
bad
that
is
for
the
health
yet
said
sheila
with
a
smile
and
it
seemed
so
strange
to
mairi
to
see
her
smile
will
not
compare
badly
in
health
with
the
people
about
us
mrs
lavender
dropped
the
question
and
began
to
explain
to
sheila
what
she
advised
her
to
do
in
the
meantime
both
the
girls
were
to
remain
in
her
house
she
would
guarantee
their
being
met
by
no
one
when
suitable
rooms
had
been
looked
out
by
paterson
they
were
to
remove
thither
the
whole
situation
of
affairs
was
at
once
perceived
by
attendant
who
was
given
to
understand
that
no
one
was
to
know
of
young
being
in
the
house
then
the
old
woman
much
contented
with
what
she
had
done
resolved
that
she
would
reward
herself
with
a
joke
and
sent
for
edward
ingram
when
sheila
as
already
described
came
into
the
room
and
found
her
old
friend
there
the
resolution
she
had
formed
went
clean
out
of
her
mind
she
forgot
entirely
the
ban
that
had
been
placed
on
ingram
by
her
husband
but
after
her
first
emotion
on
seeing
him
was
over
and
when
he
began
to
discuss
what
she
ought
to
do
and
even
to
advise
her
in
a
diffident
sort
of
way
she
remembered
all
that
she
had
forgotten
and
was
ashamed
to
find
herself
sitting
there
and
talking
to
him
as
if
it
were
in
her
house
at
borva
indeed
when
he
proposed
to
take
the
management
of
her
affairs
into
his
own
hands
and
to
go
and
look
at
certain
apartments
that
paterson
had
proposed
she
was
forced
with
great
and
pain
to
hint
to
him
that
she
could
not
avail
herself
of
his
kindness
why
he
asked
with
a
stare
of
surprise
remember
brighton
she
answered
looking
down
had
a
bad
return
for
your
kindness
to
me
i
know
he
said
carelessly
i
suppose
mr
lavender
wished
you
to
cut
me
after
my
impertinent
interference
but
things
are
very
much
changed
now
but
for
the
time
he
went
north
he
has
been
with
me
nearly
every
hour
since
you
frank
been
to
the
lewis
she
said
suddenly
with
a
look
of
fear
on
her
face
no
he
had
only
been
to
glasgow
to
see
if
you
had
gone
to
catch
the
clansman
and
go
north
from
he
take
trouble
to
do
all
that
she
asked
slowly
and
wistfully
cried
ingram
appears
to
me
neither
to
eat
nor
sleep
day
or
night
but
to
go
wandering
about
in
search
of
you
in
every
place
where
he
fancies
you
may
be
i
never
saw
a
man
so
beside
himself
with
did
not
wish
to
make
him
anxious
said
sheila
in
a
low
voice
you
tell
him
that
i
am
well
mrs
lavender
began
to
smile
were
there
not
evident
signs
of
softening
but
ingram
who
knew
the
girl
better
was
not
deceived
by
these
appearances
he
could
see
that
sheila
merely
wished
that
her
husband
should
not
suffer
pain
on
her
account
that
was
all
was
about
to
ask
you
he
said
gently
i
may
say
to
him
he
comes
to
me
continually
for
he
has
always
fancied
that
you
would
communicate
with
me
what
shall
i
say
to
him
sheila
may
tell
him
that
i
am
well
she
answered
mairi
had
by
this
time
stepped
out
of
the
room
sheila
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
her
fingers
working
nervously
with
a
paper
knife
she
held
more
than
that
he
said
he
saw
by
her
face
and
he
could
tell
by
the
sound
of
her
voice
that
her
decision
was
resolute
be
a
fool
child
said
mrs
lavender
emphatically
is
your
friend
who
can
make
everything
straight
and
comfortable
for
you
in
an
hour
or
two
and
you
quietly
put
aside
the
chance
of
reconciliation
and
bring
on
yourself
any
amount
of
misery
i
speak
for
frank
men
can
take
care
of
themselves
they
have
clubs
and
friends
and
amusements
for
the
whole
day
long
but
you
what
a
pleasant
life
you
would
have
shut
up
in
a
couple
of
rooms
scarcely
daring
to
show
yourself
at
a
window
your
fine
sentiments
are
all
very
well
but
they
stand
in
the
place
of
a
husband
to
you
and
you
will
soon
find
out
the
difference
between
living
by
yourself
like
that
and
having
some
one
in
the
house
to
look
after
you
am
i
right
ingram
or
am
i
wrong
ingram
paused
for
a
moment
and
said
have
not
the
same
courage
that
you
have
mrs
lavender
i
dare
not
advise
sheila
one
way
or
the
other
at
present
but
if
she
feels
in
her
own
heart
that
she
would
rather
return
now
to
her
husband
i
can
safely
say
that
she
would
find
him
deeply
grateful
to
her
and
that
he
would
try
to
do
everything
that
she
desired
that
i
know
he
wants
to
see
you
sheila
if
only
for
five
minutes
to
beg
your
forgiveness
can
not
see
him
she
said
with
the
same
sad
and
settled
air
am
not
to
tell
him
where
you
are
no
she
cried
with
a
sudden
and
startled
emphasis
must
not
do
that
ingram
promise
me
that
you
will
not
do
that
do
promise
you
but
you
put
a
painful
duty
on
me
sheila
for
you
know
how
he
will
believe
that
a
short
interview
with
you
would
put
everything
right
and
he
will
look
on
me
as
preventing
you
think
a
short
interview
at
present
would
put
everything
right
she
said
suddenly
looking
up
and
regarding
him
with
her
clear
steadfast
eyes
he
dared
not
answer
he
felt
in
his
inmost
heart
that
it
would
not
well
said
mrs
lavender
people
have
much
satisfaction
in
being
proud
when
they
come
to
my
age
they
may
find
they
would
have
been
happier
if
they
had
been
less
is
not
disdain
lavender
said
sheila
gently
it
is
said
the
old
woman
must
remind
you
two
people
that
i
am
an
invalid
go
away
and
have
luncheon
paterson
will
look
after
you
ingram
give
me
that
book
that
i
may
read
myself
into
a
nap
and
forget
what
i
expect
of
ingram
suddenly
remembered
he
and
sheila
and
mairi
sat
down
to
luncheon
in
the
and
while
he
strove
to
get
them
to
talk
about
borva
he
was
thinking
all
the
time
of
the
extraordinary
position
he
was
expected
to
assume
toward
sheila
not
only
was
he
to
be
the
repository
of
the
secret
of
her
place
of
residence
and
the
between
herself
and
her
husband
but
he
was
also
to
take
fortune
in
the
event
of
her
dying
and
hold
it
in
trust
for
the
young
wife
surely
this
old
woman
with
her
suspicious
ways
and
her
worldly
wisdom
would
not
be
so
foolish
as
to
hand
him
over
all
her
property
free
of
conditions
on
the
simple
understanding
that
when
he
chose
he
could
give
what
he
chose
to
sheila
and
yet
that
was
what
she
had
vowed
she
would
do
to
profound
dismay
he
labored
hard
to
lighten
the
spirits
of
those
two
girls
he
talked
of
john
the
piper
and
said
he
would
invite
him
up
to
london
and
described
his
probable
appearance
in
the
park
he
told
them
stories
of
his
adventures
while
he
was
camping
out
with
some
young
artists
in
the
western
highlands
and
told
them
anecdotes
old
recent
and
of
his
own
invention
about
the
people
he
had
met
had
they
heard
of
the
steward
on
board
one
of
the
clyde
steamers
who
had
a
percentage
on
the
drink
consumed
in
the
cabin
and
who
would
call
out
to
the
captain
wass
you
going
so
fast
dinna
put
her
into
the
quay
so
fast
there
is
a
company
down
below
and
they
are
drinking
fine
had
he
ever
told
them
of
the
porter
at
arran
who
had
demanded
sixpence
for
carrying
up
some
luggage
but
who
after
being
sent
to
get
a
sovereign
changed
came
back
with
only
eighteen
shillings
saying
yes
it
iss
sexpence
oh
ay
it
iss
sexpence
but
it
iss
two
shullens
or
of
the
other
who
after
being
paid
hung
about
the
for
nearly
an
hour
until
ingram
coming
out
asked
him
why
he
waited
whereupon
he
said
with
an
air
of
perfect
indifference
ay
there
was
something
said
about
a
dram
but
hoot
toot
it
is
of
no
consequence
whatever
and
was
it
true
that
the
sheriff
of
stornoway
was
so
a
man
that
he
remitted
the
punishment
of
certain
culprits
ordained
by
the
statute
to
be
whipped
with
birch
rods
on
the
ground
that
the
island
of
lewis
produced
no
birch
and
that
he
was
not
bound
to
import
it
and
had
mairi
heard
any
more
of
the
black
horse
of
loch
suainabhal
and
where
had
she
pulled
those
splendid
bunches
of
he
suddenly
stopped
and
sheila
looked
up
with
inquiring
eyes
how
did
he
know
that
mairi
had
brought
those
things
with
her
sheila
saw
that
he
must
have
gone
up
with
her
husband
and
must
have
seen
the
room
which
she
had
decorated
in
imitation
of
the
small
parlor
at
borvapost
she
would
rather
not
think
of
that
room
now
are
you
going
to
the
lewis
she
asked
of
him
with
her
eyes
cast
down
i
think
i
have
changed
my
mind
about
that
sheila
i
think
i
shall
go
to
the
lewis
this
her
face
became
more
and
more
embarrassed
how
was
she
to
thank
him
for
his
continued
thoughtfulness
and
is
no
necessity
he
said
lightly
man
i
am
going
with
has
no
particular
purpose
in
view
we
shall
merely
go
cruising
about
those
wonderful
lochs
and
islands
and
i
am
sure
to
run
against
some
of
those
young
fellows
i
know
who
are
prowling
about
the
with
portable
easels
they
are
good
boys
those
boys
they
are
very
hospitable
if
they
have
only
a
single
bedroom
in
a
small
cottage
as
their
studio
and
combined
i
should
not
wonder
sheila
if
i
went
ashore
somewhere
and
put
up
my
lot
with
those
young
fellows
and
listened
to
their
wicked
stories
and
lived
on
whisky
and
herrings
for
a
month
would
you
like
to
see
me
return
to
whitehall
in
kilts
and
i
should
go
into
the
office
and
salute
everybody
with
are
you
ferry
well
just
as
mairi
does
but
be
downhearted
mairi
you
speak
english
a
good
deal
better
than
many
english
folks
i
know
and
by
the
time
you
go
back
to
the
lewis
we
shall
have
you
fit
to
become
a
not
only
in
borva
but
in
stornoway
was
told
it
is
ferry
good
english
they
have
in
stornoway
said
mairi
not
very
sure
whether
ingram
was
joking
or
not
dear
child
he
cried
tell
you
it
is
the
best
english
in
the
world
if
the
queen
only
knew
she
would
send
her
grandchildren
to
be
educated
there
but
i
must
go
now
mairi
i
mean
to
come
and
take
you
to
a
theater
some
night
sheila
accompanied
him
out
into
the
hall
shall
you
see
him
she
said
with
her
eyes
cast
down
evening
he
answered
should
like
you
to
tell
him
that
i
am
well
and
that
he
need
not
be
anxious
about
that
is
all
that
is
well
sheila
i
wish
you
had
given
me
a
pleasanter
message
to
carry
but
when
you
think
of
doing
that
i
shall
be
glad
to
take
ingram
left
and
hastened
in
to
his
office
affairs
were
considerably
interfering
with
his
attendance
there
there
could
be
no
question
of
that
but
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
able
to
get
through
his
work
thoroughly
whatever
might
be
the
hours
he
devoted
to
it
so
that
he
did
not
greatly
fear
being
rebuked
for
his
present
irregularities
perhaps
if
a
grave
official
warning
had
been
probable
even
that
would
not
have
interfered
with
his
determination
to
do
what
could
be
done
for
sheila
but
this
business
of
carrying
a
message
to
lavender
was
the
most
serious
he
had
yet
undertaken
he
had
to
make
sundry
and
solemn
resolves
to
put
a
bold
face
on
the
matter
at
the
outset
and
declare
that
wild
horses
would
not
tear
from
him
any
further
information
he
feared
the
piteous
appeals
that
might
be
made
to
him
the
representations
that
merely
for
the
sake
of
an
imprudent
promise
he
was
delaying
a
reconciliation
between
these
two
until
that
might
be
impossible
the
reasons
that
would
be
urged
on
him
for
considering
welfare
as
paramount
to
his
own
scruples
he
went
through
the
interview
as
he
foresaw
it
a
dozen
times
over
and
constructed
replies
to
each
argument
and
entreaty
of
course
it
would
be
simple
enough
to
meet
all
demands
with
a
simple
but
there
are
circumstances
in
which
the
heroic
method
of
solving
difficulties
becomes
a
trifle
inhuman
he
had
promised
to
dine
with
lavender
that
evening
at
his
club
when
he
went
along
to
street
at
the
appointed
hour
his
host
had
not
arrived
he
walked
for
about
ten
minutes
and
then
lavender
appeared
haggard
and
worn
out
with
fatigue
have
heard
nothing
i
can
hear
nothing
i
have
been
everywhere
he
said
leading
the
way
at
once
into
the
am
sorry
i
have
kept
you
waiting
they
sat
down
at
a
small
side
table
there
were
few
men
in
the
club
at
this
late
season
so
that
they
could
talk
freely
enough
when
the
waiter
had
come
and
gone
i
have
some
news
for
you
lavender
ingram
said
you
know
where
she
is
said
the
other
eagerly
he
almost
called
aloud
in
his
anxiety
ingram
said
slowly
is
in
london
and
she
is
very
well
and
you
need
have
no
anxiety
about
where
is
she
demanded
lavender
taking
no
heed
of
the
waiter
who
was
standing
by
and
uncorking
a
bottle
promised
her
not
to
tell
have
spoken
with
her
then
did
she
say
where
has
she
been
good
heavens
ingram
you
mean
to
say
you
are
going
to
keep
it
a
secret
no
said
the
other
will
tell
you
everything
she
said
to
me
if
you
like
only
i
will
not
tell
you
where
she
will
not
ask
you
said
lavender
at
once
she
does
not
wish
me
to
know
but
you
can
tell
me
about
herself
what
was
she
looking
like
is
mairi
with
her
mairi
is
with
her
and
of
course
she
is
looking
a
little
troubled
and
pale
and
so
forth
but
she
is
very
well
i
should
think
and
quite
comfortably
situated
she
said
i
was
to
tell
you
that
she
was
well
and
that
you
need
not
be
sent
a
message
to
me
is
jove
ingram
how
can
i
ever
thank
you
enough
i
feel
as
glad
just
now
as
if
she
had
really
come
home
again
and
how
did
you
manage
it
lavender
in
his
excitement
and
gratitude
kept
filling
up
his
glass
the
moment
the
least
quantity
had
been
taken
out
of
it
the
wonder
was
he
did
not
fill
all
the
glasses
on
that
side
of
the
table
and
beseech
ingram
to
have
two
or
three
dinners
all
at
once
you
give
me
any
credit
about
it
ingram
said
stumbled
against
her
by
accident
at
least
i
did
not
find
her
out
she
send
for
you
but
look
here
lavender
this
sort
of
will
lead
to
but
one
thing
and
you
say
yourself
you
try
to
find
out
where
she
from
you
any
way
but
how
can
i
help
wanting
to
know
where
she
is
and
my
aunt
was
saying
just
now
that
very
likely
she
had
gone
right
away
to
the
other
end
of
london
to
peckham
or
some
such
have
seen
mrs
lavender
then
have
just
come
from
there
the
old
heathen
thinks
the
whole
affair
rather
a
good
joke
but
perhaps
that
was
only
her
way
of
showing
her
temper
for
she
was
in
a
bit
of
rage
to
be
sure
and
so
sheila
sent
me
that
message
she
want
money
would
you
take
her
some
money
from
me
he
said
eagerly
any
bond
of
union
between
him
and
sheila
would
be
of
some
value
think
she
needs
money
and
in
any
case
i
know
she
take
it
from
now
ingram
you
have
seen
her
and
talked
with
her
what
do
you
think
she
intends
to
do
what
do
you
think
she
would
have
me
do
are
very
dangerous
questions
for
me
to
answer
ingram
said
see
how
you
can
expect
me
to
assume
the
ask
you
to
do
that
at
all
but
i
never
found
your
advice
to
fail
and
if
you
give
me
any
hint
as
to
what
i
should
do
i
will
do
it
upon
my
own
i
but
this
i
will
do
i
will
tell
you
as
nearly
as
ever
i
can
what
she
said
and
you
can
judge
for
very
cautiously
indeed
did
ingram
set
out
on
this
perilous
undertaking
it
was
no
easy
matter
so
to
shut
out
all
references
to
surroundings
that
no
hint
should
be
given
to
this
anxious
listener
as
to
her
whereabouts
but
ingram
got
through
it
successfully
and
when
he
had
finished
lavender
sat
some
time
in
silence
merely
toying
with
his
knife
for
indeed
he
had
eaten
nothing
it
is
her
wish
he
said
slowly
i
should
not
go
to
see
her
i
will
try
to
do
so
but
i
should
like
to
know
where
she
is
you
say
she
is
comfortable
and
she
has
mairi
for
a
companion
and
that
is
something
in
the
meantime
i
suppose
i
must
see
myself
how
waiting
is
likely
to
do
much
good
said
ingram
alter
your
relations
may
alter
her
determination
a
woman
is
sure
to
soften
into
charity
and
forgiveness
she
help
you
were
to
ask
sheila
now
she
would
say
she
had
forgiven
you
already
but
that
is
a
different
matter
from
getting
her
to
resume
her
former
method
of
life
with
you
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
should
strongly
advise
her
if
i
were
to
give
advice
at
all
not
to
attempt
anything
of
the
sort
one
failure
is
bad
enough
and
has
wrought
sufficient
what
am
i
to
do
ingram
must
judge
for
yourself
what
is
the
most
likely
way
of
winning
back
confidence
in
you
and
the
most
likely
conditions
under
which
she
might
be
induced
to
join
you
again
you
need
not
expect
to
get
her
back
into
that
square
i
should
fancy
experiment
has
rather
broken
said
lavender
bore
you
any
more
just
now
about
my
affairs
look
after
your
dinner
old
fellow
your
starving
yourself
help
me
mean
to
starve
myself
at
all
said
ingram
steadily
making
his
way
through
the
abundant
dishes
his
friend
had
ordered
i
had
a
very
good
luncheon
this
morning
with
sheila
lavender
said
quickly
does
it
surprise
you
to
find
that
she
is
in
a
place
where
she
can
get
food
i
wish
the
poor
child
had
made
better
use
of
her
he
said
after
a
minute
you
take
some
money
from
me
without
her
knowing
of
it
and
try
to
get
her
some
of
the
little
things
she
likes
some
delicacies
you
know
they
might
be
smuggled
in
as
it
were
without
her
knowing
who
paid
for
them
there
was
you
know
with
strawberries
in
it
that
she
was
fond
of
dear
fellow
a
woman
in
her
position
thinks
of
something
else
than
in
why
she
have
it
all
the
same
i
would
give
twenty
pounds
to
get
some
little
gratification
of
that
sort
conveyed
to
her
and
if
you
could
try
ingram
dear
fellow
she
has
got
everything
she
can
want
there
was
no
at
luncheon
but
doubtless
there
will
be
at
so
sheila
was
staying
in
a
house
in
which
ices
could
be
prepared
suggestion
had
had
no
cunning
intention
in
it
but
here
was
an
obvious
piece
of
information
she
was
in
no
humble
then
she
was
either
staying
with
some
friends
and
she
had
no
friend
but
friends
or
she
was
staying
at
a
hotel
he
remembered
that
she
had
once
dined
at
the
langham
kavanagh
having
persuaded
her
to
go
to
meet
some
american
visitors
might
she
have
gone
thither
lavender
was
somewhat
silent
during
the
rest
of
that
meal
for
he
was
thinking
of
other
things
besides
the
mere
question
as
to
where
sheila
might
be
staying
he
was
trying
to
imagine
what
she
might
have
felt
before
she
was
driven
to
this
step
he
was
trying
to
recall
all
manner
of
incidents
of
their
daily
life
that
he
now
saw
might
have
appeared
to
her
in
a
very
different
light
from
that
in
which
he
saw
them
he
was
wondering
too
how
all
this
could
be
altered
and
a
new
life
begun
for
them
both
if
that
were
still
possible
they
had
gone
up
stairs
into
the
when
a
card
was
brought
to
lavender
mosenberg
is
below
he
said
to
ingram
will
be
a
livelier
companion
for
you
than
i
could
be
waiter
ask
this
gentleman
to
come
the
handsome
jew
boy
came
eagerly
into
the
room
with
much
excitement
visible
on
his
face
do
you
know
he
said
to
lavender
have
found
out
where
mrs
lavender
is
yes
she
is
at
your
house
i
saw
her
this
afternoon
for
one
moment
he
stopped
for
he
saw
by
the
vexation
on
face
that
he
had
done
something
wrong
it
a
mistake
he
said
it
a
secret
is
not
likely
to
be
a
secret
if
you
have
got
hold
of
it
said
ingram
sharply
am
very
sorry
said
the
boy
thought
you
were
all
anxious
to
know
does
not
matter
in
the
least
said
lavender
quietly
to
both
of
them
shall
not
seek
to
disturb
her
i
am
about
to
leave
are
you
going
said
the
boy
know
that
at
least
had
been
part
of
the
result
of
his
meditations
and
ingram
looking
at
him
wondered
whether
he
meant
to
go
away
without
trying
to
say
one
word
to
sheila
here
lavender
he
said
must
not
fancy
we
were
trying
to
play
any
useless
and
impertinent
trick
or
next
day
sheila
will
leave
your
house
and
then
i
should
have
told
you
that
she
had
been
there
and
how
the
old
lady
received
her
it
was
own
wish
that
the
lodgings
she
is
going
to
should
not
be
known
she
fancies
that
would
save
both
of
you
a
great
deal
of
unnecessary
and
fruitless
pain
do
you
see
that
really
is
her
only
object
in
wishing
to
have
any
concealment
about
the
there
is
no
need
of
any
such
concealment
he
said
may
tell
sheila
that
if
she
likes
to
stay
on
with
my
aunt
so
much
the
better
and
i
take
it
very
kind
of
her
that
she
went
there
instead
of
going
home
or
to
a
strange
i
to
tell
her
that
you
mean
to
leave
london
they
went
into
the
mosenberg
was
not
permitted
to
play
as
he
had
not
dined
in
the
club
but
ingram
and
lavender
proceeded
to
have
a
game
the
former
being
content
to
accept
something
like
thirty
in
a
hundred
it
was
speedily
very
clear
that
heart
was
not
in
the
contest
he
kept
forgetting
which
ball
he
had
been
playing
missing
easy
shots
playing
a
perversely
wrong
game
and
so
forth
and
yet
his
spirits
were
not
much
downcast
peter
hewetson
still
at
tarbert
do
you
know
he
asked
of
ingram
believe
so
i
heard
of
him
lately
he
and
one
or
two
more
are
suppose
look
in
on
them
if
you
go
north
the
place
is
badly
perfumed
but
picturesque
and
there
is
generally
plenty
of
whisky
do
you
go
north
know
in
a
week
or
that
was
all
lavender
hinted
of
his
plans
he
went
home
early
that
night
and
spent
an
hour
or
two
in
packing
up
some
things
and
in
writing
a
long
letter
to
his
aunt
which
was
destined
considerably
to
astonish
that
lady
then
he
lay
down
and
had
a
few
rest
in
the
early
morning
he
went
out
and
walked
across
kensington
gardens
down
to
the
gore
he
wished
to
have
one
look
at
the
house
in
which
sheila
was
or
perhaps
he
might
from
a
distance
see
her
come
out
on
a
simple
errand
he
knew
for
example
that
she
had
a
superstitious
liking
for
posting
her
letters
herself
in
wet
weather
or
dry
she
invariably
carried
her
own
correspondence
to
the
nearest
perhaps
he
might
have
one
glimpse
at
her
face
to
see
how
she
was
looking
before
he
left
london
there
were
few
people
about
one
or
two
lawyers
and
merchants
were
riding
by
to
have
their
morning
canter
in
the
park
the
shops
were
being
opened
over
there
was
the
house
with
its
dark
front
of
bricks
its
hard
ivy
and
its
small
windows
with
formal
red
curtains
in
which
sheila
was
immured
that
was
certainly
not
the
palace
that
a
beautiful
should
have
inhabited
where
were
the
pine
woods
around
it
and
the
lofty
hills
and
the
wild
beating
of
the
waves
on
the
sands
below
and
now
it
seemed
strange
and
sad
that
just
as
he
was
about
to
go
away
to
the
north
and
breathe
the
salt
air
again
and
find
the
strong
west
winds
blowing
across
the
mountain
peaks
and
through
the
furze
sheila
a
daughter
of
the
sea
and
the
rocks
should
be
hiding
herself
in
obscure
lodgings
in
the
heart
of
the
great
city
perhaps
he
could
not
but
think
at
this
time
if
he
had
only
the
chance
of
speaking
to
her
for
a
couple
of
moments
he
could
persuade
her
to
forgive
him
everything
that
had
happened
and
go
away
with
him
away
from
london
and
all
the
associations
that
had
vexed
her
and
almost
broken
her
heart
to
the
free
and
open
and
joyous
life
on
the
far
sea
coasts
of
the
hebrides
something
caused
him
to
turn
his
head
for
a
second
and
he
knew
that
sheila
was
coming
along
the
pavement
not
from
but
towards
the
house
it
was
too
late
to
think
of
getting
out
of
her
way
and
yet
he
dared
not
go
up
to
her
and
speak
to
her
as
he
had
wished
to
do
she
too
had
seen
him
there
was
a
quick
frightened
look
in
her
eyes
and
then
she
came
along
with
her
face
pale
and
her
head
downcast
he
did
not
seek
to
interrupt
her
his
eyes
too
were
lowered
as
she
passed
him
without
taking
any
notice
of
his
presence
although
the
sad
face
and
the
troubled
lips
told
of
the
pain
at
her
heart
he
had
hoped
perchance
for
one
word
for
even
a
sign
of
recognition
but
she
went
by
him
calmly
gravely
and
silently
she
went
into
the
house
and
he
turned
away
with
a
weight
at
his
heart
as
though
the
gates
of
heaven
had
been
closed
against
him
part
x
chapter
xxii
hadrianus
and
the
island
of
borva
lay
warm
and
green
and
bright
under
a
blue
sky
there
were
no
white
curls
of
foam
on
loch
roag
but
only
the
long
atlantic
swell
coming
in
to
fall
on
the
white
beach
away
over
there
in
the
south
the
fine
grays
and
purples
of
the
giant
suainabhal
shone
in
the
sunlight
amid
the
clear
air
and
the
beautiful
flew
about
the
rocks
their
screaming
being
the
only
sound
audible
in
the
stillness
the
king
of
borva
was
down
by
the
shore
seated
on
a
stool
and
engaged
in
the
idyllic
operation
of
painting
a
boat
which
had
been
hauled
up
on
the
sand
it
was
the
he
would
let
no
one
else
on
the
island
touch
boat
duncan
it
is
true
was
permitted
to
keep
her
masts
and
sails
and
seats
sound
and
white
but
as
for
the
decorative
painting
of
the
small
craft
including
a
little
bit
of
amateur
gilding
that
was
the
exclusive
right
of
mackenzie
himself
for
of
course
the
old
man
said
to
himself
sheila
was
coming
back
to
borva
one
of
these
days
and
she
would
be
proud
to
find
her
own
boat
bright
and
sound
if
she
and
her
husband
should
resolve
to
spend
half
the
year
in
stornoway
would
not
the
small
craft
be
of
use
to
her
there
and
sure
he
was
that
a
prettier
little
vessel
never
entered
stornoway
bay
mackenzie
was
at
this
moment
engaged
in
putting
a
thin
line
of
green
around
the
white
bulwarks
that
might
have
been
distinguished
across
loch
roag
so
keen
and
pure
was
the
color
a
much
heavier
boat
and
was
slowly
coming
around
the
point
at
this
moment
mackenzie
raised
his
eyes
from
his
work
and
knew
that
duncan
was
coming
back
from
callernish
some
few
minutes
thereafter
the
boat
was
run
into
her
moorings
and
duncan
came
along
the
beach
with
a
parcel
in
his
hand
wass
your
letters
sir
he
said
there
iss
one
of
them
will
be
from
miss
sheila
if
i
wass
make
no
he
remained
there
duncan
generally
knew
pretty
well
when
a
letter
from
sheila
was
among
the
documents
he
had
to
deliver
and
on
such
an
occasion
he
invariably
lingered
about
to
hear
the
news
which
was
immediately
spread
abroad
throughout
the
island
the
old
king
of
borva
was
not
a
garrulous
man
but
he
was
glad
that
the
people
about
him
should
know
that
his
sheila
had
become
a
fine
lady
in
the
south
and
saw
fine
things
and
went
among
fine
people
perhaps
this
notion
of
his
was
a
sort
of
apology
to
them
perhaps
it
was
an
apology
to
himself
for
his
having
let
her
go
away
from
the
island
but
at
all
events
the
simple
folks
about
borva
knew
that
miss
sheila
as
they
still
invariably
called
her
lived
in
the
same
town
as
the
queen
herself
and
saw
many
lords
and
ladies
and
was
present
at
great
festivities
as
became
only
daughter
and
naturally
these
rumors
and
stories
were
exaggerated
by
the
kindly
interest
and
affection
of
the
people
into
something
far
beyond
what
father
intended
insomuch
that
many
an
old
crone
would
proudly
and
sagaciously
wag
her
head
and
say
that
when
miss
sheila
came
back
to
borva
strange
things
might
be
seen
and
it
would
be
a
proud
day
for
mackenzie
if
he
was
to
go
down
to
the
shore
to
meet
queen
victoria
herself
and
the
princes
and
princesses
and
many
fine
people
all
come
to
stay
at
his
house
and
have
great
rejoicings
in
borva
thus
it
was
that
duncan
invariably
lingered
about
when
he
brought
a
letter
from
sheila
and
if
her
father
happened
to
forget
or
be
duncan
would
humbly
but
firmly
remind
him
on
this
occasion
mackenzie
put
down
his
and
took
the
bundle
of
letters
and
newspapers
duncan
had
brought
him
he
selected
that
from
sheila
and
threw
the
others
on
the
beach
beside
him
there
was
really
no
news
in
the
letter
sheila
merely
said
that
she
could
not
as
yet
answer
her
question
as
to
the
time
she
might
probably
visit
lewis
she
hoped
that
he
was
well
and
that
if
she
could
not
get
up
to
borva
that
autumn
he
would
come
south
to
london
for
a
time
when
the
hard
weather
set
in
in
the
north
and
so
forth
but
there
was
something
in
the
tone
of
the
letter
that
struck
the
old
man
as
being
unusual
and
strange
it
was
very
formal
in
its
phraseology
he
read
it
twice
over
very
carefully
and
forgot
altogether
that
duncan
was
waiting
indeed
he
was
going
to
turn
away
forgetting
his
work
and
the
other
letters
that
still
lay
on
the
beach
when
he
observed
that
there
was
a
postscript
on
the
other
side
of
the
last
page
it
merely
said
you
please
address
your
letters
now
to
pembroke
road
south
kensington
where
i
may
be
for
some
time
that
was
an
imprudent
postscript
if
she
had
shown
the
letter
to
any
one
she
would
have
been
warned
of
the
blunder
she
was
committing
but
the
child
had
not
much
cunning
and
wrote
and
posted
the
letter
in
the
belief
that
her
father
would
simply
do
as
she
asked
him
and
suspect
nothing
and
ask
no
questions
when
old
mackenzie
read
that
postscript
he
could
only
stare
at
the
paper
before
him
there
be
anything
wrong
sir
said
the
tall
keeper
whose
keen
gray
eyes
had
been
fixed
on
his
face
the
sound
of
voice
startled
and
recalled
mackenzie
who
immediately
turned
and
said
lightly
what
wass
you
thinking
would
be
wrong
oh
there
is
nothing
wrong
whatever
but
mairi
she
will
be
greatly
surprised
and
she
is
going
to
write
no
letters
until
she
comes
back
to
tell
you
what
she
has
seen
that
is
the
message
there
will
be
for
scarlett
she
is
very
duncan
picked
up
the
other
letters
and
newspapers
may
tek
them
to
the
house
duncan
said
mackenzie
and
then
he
added
carelessly
you
hear
when
the
steamer
was
thinking
of
leaving
stornoway
this
night
were
saying
it
would
be
seven
or
six
as
there
was
a
great
deal
of
cargo
to
get
on
i
am
thinking
duncan
i
would
like
to
go
with
her
as
far
as
oban
or
glasgow
oh
yes
i
will
go
with
her
as
far
as
glasgow
be
sharp
duncan
and
bring
in
the
the
keeper
stared
fearing
his
master
had
gone
mad
wass
going
with
her
this
ferry
night
be
sharp
duncan
said
mackenzie
doing
his
best
to
conceal
his
impatience
and
determination
under
a
careless
air
sir
you
canna
do
it
said
duncan
peevishly
hef
no
things
looked
out
to
go
and
by
the
time
we
would
get
to
callernish
it
was
a
ferry
hard
drive
there
will
be
to
get
to
stornoway
by
six
and
there
is
the
mare
sir
she
will
hef
lost
a
shoe
diplomacy
gave
way
he
turned
upon
his
keeper
with
a
sudden
fierceness
and
with
a
stamp
of
his
foot
you
duncan
macdonald
is
it
you
or
me
that
is
the
master
i
will
go
to
stornoway
this
ferry
moment
if
i
hef
to
buy
twenty
horses
and
there
was
a
light
under
the
shaggy
eyebrows
that
warned
duncan
to
have
done
with
his
remonstrances
ferry
well
sir
ferry
well
sir
he
said
going
off
to
the
boat
and
grumbling
as
he
went
miss
sheila
was
here
it
would
be
no
going
away
to
glesca
without
any
things
wis
you
as
if
you
wass
a
poor
traffelin
tailor
that
hass

in
the
world
but
a
needle
and
a
thimble
mirover
and
what

people

to
say
and
sa
captain
of

as

sa
sweerin
for
i
will

oh
yes
i
will
get
sa
boat
ready
but
i
do
not
understand
why
i
will
get
sa
boat
by
this
time
indeed
he
had
got
along
to
the
larger
boat
and
his
grumblings
were
inaudible
to
the
object
of
them
mackenzie
went
to
the
small
and
waited
when
he
got
into
the
boat
and
sat
down
in
the
stern
taking
the
tiller
in
his
right
hand
he
still
held
letter
in
the
other
hand
although
he
did
not
need
to
it
they
sailed
out
into
the
blue
waters
of
the
loch
and
rounded
the
point
of
the
island
in
absolute
silence
duncan
meanwhile
being
both
sulky
and
curious
he
could
not
make
out
why
his
master
should
so
suddenly
leave
the
island
without
informing
any
one
without
even
taking
with
him
that
tall
and
black
hat
which
he
sometimes
wore
on
important
occasions
yet
there
was
a
letter
in
his
hand
and
it
was
a
letter
from
miss
sheila
was
the
news
about
mairi
the
only
news
in
it
duncan
kept
looking
ahead
to
see
that
the
boat
was
steering
her
right
course
for
the
narrows
and
was
anxious
now
that
he
had
started
to
make
the
voyage
in
the
least
possible
time
but
all
the
same
his
eyes
would
come
back
to
mackenzie
who
sat
very
much
absorbed
steering
almost
mechanically
seldom
looking
ahead
but
instinctively
guessing
his
course
by
the
outlines
of
the
shore
close
by
there
any
bad
news
sir
from
miss
sheila
he
was
compelled
to
say
at
last
sheila
said
mackenzie
impatiently
it
an
infant
you
are
that
you
will
call
a
married
woman
by
such
a
name
duncan
had
never
been
checked
before
for
a
habit
which
was
common
to
the
whole
island
of
borva
iss
no
bad
news
continued
mackenzie
impatiently
it
a
story
you
would
like
to
tek
back
to
the
people
of
borvapost
wass
no
thought
of
such
a
thing
wass
come
into
my
head
sir
said
duncan
iss
no
one
in
sa
island
would
like
to
carry
bad
news
about
miss
sheila
and
there
iss
no
one
in
sa
island
would
like
to
hear
it
not
any
one
whatever
and
i
can
answer
for
hold
your
tongue
about
it
there
is
no
bad
news
from
sheila
said
mackenzie
and
duncan
relapsed
into
silence
not
very
well
content
by
dint
of
very
hard
driving
indeed
mackenzie
just
caught
the
boat
as
she
was
leaving
stornoway
harbor
the
hurry
he
was
in
fortunately
saving
him
from
the
curiosity
and
inquiries
of
the
people
he
knew
on
the
pier
as
for
the
frank
and
captain
he
did
not
show
that
excessive
interest
in
affairs
that
duncan
had
feared
but
when
the
steamer
was
well
away
from
the
coast
and
bearing
down
on
her
route
to
skye
he
came
and
had
a
chat
with
the
king
of
borva
about
the
condition
of
affairs
on
the
west
of
the
island
and
he
was
good
enough
to
ask
too
about
the
young
lady
that
had
married
the
english
gentleman
mackenzie
said
briefly
that
she
was
very
well
and
returned
to
the
subject
of
the
fishing
it
was
on
a
wet
and
dreary
morning
that
mackenzie
arrived
in
london
and
as
he
was
slowly
driven
through
the
long
and
dismal
thoroughfares
with
their
gray
and
melancholy
houses
their
under
umbrellas
and
their
smoke
and
drizzle
and
dirt
he
could
not
help
saying
to
himself
poor
sheila
it
was
not
a
pleasant
place
surely
to
live
in
always
although
it
might
be
all
very
well
for
a
visit
indeed
the
cheerless
day
added
to
the
gloomy
forebodings
in
his
mind
and
it
needed
all
his
resolve
and
his
pride
in
his
own
diplomacy
to
carry
out
his
plan
of
approaching
sheila
when
he
got
down
to
pembroke
road
he
stopped
the
cab
at
the
corner
and
paid
the
man
then
he
walked
along
the
thoroughfare
having
a
look
at
the
houses
at
length
he
came
to
the
number
mentioned
in
letter
and
he
found
that
there
was
a
brass
plate
on
the
door
bearing
an
unfamiliar
name
his
suspicions
were
confirmed
he
went
up
the
steps
and
knocked
a
small
girl
answered
the
summons
mrs
lavender
living
here
he
said
she
looked
for
a
moment
with
some
surprise
at
the
short
man
with
his
sailor
costume
his
peaked
cap
and
his
voluminous
gray
beard
and
shaggy
eyebrows
and
then
she
said
that
she
would
ask
and
what
was
his
name
but
mackenzie
was
too
sharp
not
to
know
what
that
meant
am
her
father
it
will
do
ferry
well
if
you
will
show
me
the
and
he
stepped
inside
the
small
girl
obediently
shut
the
door
and
then
led
the
way
the
next
minute
mackenzie
had
entered
the
room
and
there
before
him
was
sheila
bending
over
mairi
and
teaching
her
how
to
do
some
the
girl
looked
up
on
hearing
some
one
enter
and
then
when
she
suddenly
saw
her
father
there
she
uttered
a
slight
cry
of
alarm
and
shrunk
back
if
he
had
been
less
intent
on
his
own
plans
he
would
have
been
amazed
and
pained
by
this
action
on
the
part
of
his
daughter
who
used
to
run
to
him
on
great
occasions
and
small
whenever
she
saw
him
but
the
girl
had
for
the
last
few
days
been
so
habitually
schooling
herself
into
the
notion
that
she
was
keeping
a
secret
from
him
she
had
become
so
deeply
conscious
of
the
concealment
intended
in
that
brief
letter
that
she
instinctively
shrank
from
him
when
he
suddenly
appeared
it
was
but
for
a
moment
mackenzie
came
forward
with
a
fine
assumption
of
carelessness
and
shook
hands
with
sheila
and
with
mairi
and
said
do
you
do
mairi
and
are
you
ferry
well
sheila
and
you
will
not
expect
me
this
morning
but
when
a
man
will
not
pay
you
what
he
wass
owing
it
wass
no
good
letting
it
go
on
in
that
way
and
i
hef
come
to
london
he
shook
the
from
his
cap
and
was
a
little
embarrassed
i
hef
come
to
london
to
have
the
account
settled
up
for
it
wass
no
good
letting
him
go
on
for
effer
and
effer
ay
and
how
are
you
sheila
he
looked
about
the
room
he
would
not
look
at
her
she
stood
there
unable
to
speak
and
with
her
face
grown
wild
and
pale
it
wass
raining
hard
all
the
last
night
and
there
wass
a
good
deal
of
water
came
into
the
carriage
and
it
is
a
ferry
hard
bed
you
will
make
of
a
carriage
ay
it
wass
so
and
this
a
new
house
you
will
hef
sheila
she
had
been
coming
nearer
to
him
with
her
face
down
and
the
speechless
lips
trembling
and
then
suddenly
with
a
strange
sob
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
and
hid
her
head
and
burst
into
a
wild
fit
of
crying
he
said
ails
you
what
iss
all
the
matter
mairi
had
covertly
got
out
of
the
room
papa
i
have
left
him
the
girl
cried
said
her
father
quite
cheerfully
ay
i
thought
there
was
some
little
thing
wrong
when
your
letter
wass
come
to
us
the
other
day
but
it
is
no
use
making
a
great
deal
of
trouble
about
it
sheila
for
it
is
easy
to
have
all
those
things
put
right
again
oh
yes
ferry
easy
and
you
have
left
your
own
home
sheila
and
where
is
mr
lavender
papa
she
cried
must
not
try
to
see
him
you
must
promise
not
to
go
to
see
him
i
should
have
told
you
everything
when
i
wrote
but
i
thought
you
would
come
up
and
blame
it
all
on
him
and
i
think
it
is
i
who
am
to
i
do
not
want
to
blame
any
one
said
her
father
must
not
make
so
much
of
these
things
sheila
it
is
a
pity
yes
it
is
a
ferry
great
pity
your
husband
and
you
will
hef
a
quarrel
but
it
iss
no
uncommon
thing
for
these
troubles
to
happen
and
i
am
coming
to
you
this
morning
not
to
make
any
more
trouble
but
to
see
if
it
can
not
be
put
right
again
and
i
will
not
blame
anyone
but
if
i
wass
to
see
mr
lavender
a
bitter
anger
had
filled
his
heart
from
the
moment
he
had
learned
how
matters
stood
and
yet
he
was
talking
in
such
a
bland
almost
cheerful
fashion
that
his
own
daughter
was
imposed
upon
and
began
to
grow
comforted
the
mere
fact
that
her
father
now
knew
all
her
troubles
and
was
not
disposed
to
take
a
very
gloomy
view
of
them
was
of
itself
a
great
relief
to
her
and
she
was
greatly
pleased
too
to
hear
her
father
speak
in
the
same
light
and
even
friendly
fashion
of
her
husband
she
had
dreaded
the
possible
results
of
her
writing
home
and
relating
what
had
occurred
she
knew
the
powerful
passion
of
which
this
lonely
old
man
was
capable
and
if
he
had
come
suddenly
down
south
with
a
wild
desire
to
revenge
the
wrongs
of
his
daughter
what
might
not
have
happened
sheila
sat
down
and
with
averted
eyes
told
her
father
the
whole
story
ingenuously
making
all
possible
excuses
for
her
husband
and
intimating
strongly
that
the
more
she
looked
over
the
history
of
the
past
time
the
more
she
was
convinced
that
she
was
herself
to
blame
it
was
but
natural
that
mr
lavender
should
like
to
live
in
the
manner
to
which
he
had
been
accustomed
she
had
tried
to
live
that
way
too
and
the
failure
to
do
so
was
surely
her
fault
he
had
been
very
kind
to
her
he
was
always
buying
her
new
dresses
jewelry
and
what
not
and
was
always
pleased
to
take
her
to
be
amused
anywhere
all
this
she
said
and
a
great
deal
more
and
although
mackenzie
did
not
believe
the
half
of
it
he
did
not
say
so
ay
sheila
he
said
cheerfully
if
everything
was
right
like
that
what
for
will
you
be
here
everything
was
not
right
papa
the
girl
said
still
with
her
eyes
cast
down
could
not
live
any
longer
like
that
and
i
had
to
come
away
that
is
my
fault
and
i
could
not
help
it
and
there
was
a
misunderstanding
between
us
about
visit
for
i
had
said
nothing
about
it
and
he
was
surprised
and
he
had
some
friends
coming
to
see
us
that
day
well
there
iss
no
great
harm
done
none
at
all
said
her
father
lightly
and
perhaps
beginning
to
think
that
after
all
something
was
to
be
said
for
side
of
the
question
you
will
not
suppose
sheila
that
i
am
coming
to
make
any
trouble
by
quarreling
with
any
one
there
are
some
men
oh
yes
there
are
ferry
many
that
would
have
no
judgment
at
such
a
time
and
they
would
think
only
about
their
daughter
and
hef
no
regard
for
any
one
else
and
they
would
only
make
effery
one
angrier
than
before
but
you
will
tell
me
sheila
where
mr
lavender
do
not
know
she
said
i
am
anxious
papa
you
should
not
go
to
see
him
i
have
asked
you
to
promise
that
to
please
he
hesitated
there
were
not
many
things
he
could
refuse
his
daughter
but
he
was
not
sure
he
ought
to
yield
to
her
in
this
for
were
not
these
two
a
couple
of
foolish
young
things
who
wanted
an
experienced
and
cool
and
shrewd
person
to
come
with
a
little
dexterous
management
and
arrange
their
affairs
for
them
do
not
think
i
have
half
explained
the
difference
between
us
said
sheila
in
the
same
low
voice
is
no
passing
quarrel
to
be
mended
up
and
forgotten
it
is
nothing
like
that
you
must
leave
it
alone
is
foolishness
sheila
said
the
old
man
with
a
little
impatience
are
making
big
things
out
of
ferry
little
and
you
will
only
bring
trouble
to
yourself
how
do
you
know
but
that
he
wishes
to
hef
all
this
misunderstanding
removed
and
hef
you
go
back
to
him
know
that
he
wishes
that
she
said
calmly
you
speak
as
if
you
wass
in
great
trouble
here
and
yet
you
will
not
go
back
he
said
in
great
surprise
that
is
so
she
said
is
no
use
in
my
going
back
to
the
same
sort
of
life
it
was
not
happiness
for
either
of
us
and
to
me
it
was
misery
if
i
am
to
blame
for
it
that
is
only
a
if
you
will
not
go
back
to
him
sheila
her
father
said
least
you
will
go
back
with
me
to
can
not
do
that
either
said
the
girl
with
the
same
quiet
yet
decisive
manner
mackenzie
rose
with
an
impatient
gesture
and
walked
to
the
window
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
he
was
very
well
aware
that
when
sheila
had
resolved
upon
anything
she
had
thought
it
well
over
beforehand
and
was
not
likely
to
change
her
mind
and
yet
the
notion
of
his
daughter
living
in
lodgings
in
a
strange
town
her
only
companion
a
young
girl
who
had
never
been
in
the
place
before
was
vexatiously
absurd
he
said
will
come
to
a
better
understanding
about
that
i
suppose
you
wass
afraid
the
people
would
wonder
at
your
coming
back
alone
but
they
will
know
nothing
about
it
mairi
she
is
a
very
good
lass
she
will
do
anything
you
will
ask
of
her
you
hef
no
need
to
think
she
will
carry
stories
and
every
one
wass
thinking
you
will
be
coming
to
the
lewis
this
year
and
it
is
ferry
glad
they
will
be
to
see
you
and
if
the
house
at
borvapost
hass
not
enough
amusement
for
you
after
you
hef
been
in
a
big
town
like
this
you
will
live
in
stornoway
with
some
of
our
friends
there
and
you
will
come
over
to
borva
when
you
i
went
up
to
the
lewis
said
sheila
you
think
i
could
live
anywhere
but
in
borva
it
is
not
any
amusements
i
will
be
thinking
about
but
i
can
not
go
back
to
the
lewis
her
father
saw
how
the
pride
of
the
girl
had
driven
her
to
this
decision
and
saw
too
how
useless
it
was
for
him
to
reason
with
her
just
at
the
present
moment
still
there
was
plenty
of
occasion
here
for
the
use
of
a
little
diplomacy
merely
to
smooth
the
way
for
the
reconciliation
of
husband
and
wife
and
mackenzie
concluded
in
his
own
mind
that
it
was
far
from
injudicious
to
allow
sheila
to
convince
herself
that
she
bore
part
of
the
blame
of
this
separation
for
example
he
now
proposed
that
the
discussion
of
the
whole
question
be
postponed
for
the
present
and
that
sheila
should
take
him
about
london
and
show
him
all
that
she
had
learned
and
he
suggested
that
they
should
then
and
there
get
a
hansom
cab
and
drive
to
some
exhibition
or
other
hansom
papa
said
sheila
must
go
with
us
you
this
was
precisely
what
he
had
angled
for
and
he
said
with
a
show
of
impatience
how
can
we
take
about
mairi
to
every
place
mairi
is
a
ferry
good
lass
oh
yes
but
she
is
a
the
words
nearly
stuck
in
his
throat
and
indeed
had
any
other
addressed
such
a
phrase
to
one
of
his
kith
and
kin
there
would
have
been
an
explosion
of
rage
but
now
he
was
determined
to
show
to
sheila
that
her
husband
had
some
cause
for
objecting
to
this
girl
sitting
down
with
his
friends
but
neither
husband
nor
father
could
make
sheila
forswear
allegiance
to
what
her
own
heart
told
her
was
just
and
honorable
and
generous
and
indeed
her
father
was
not
displeased
to
see
her
turn
around
on
himself
with
just
a
touch
of
indignation
in
her
voice
is
my
guest
papa
she
said
is
not
like
you
to
think
of
leaving
her
at
it
wass
of
no
consequence
said
old
mackenzie
carelessly
indeed
he
was
not
sorry
to
have
met
with
this
rebuff
is
a
ferry
good
girl
oh
yes
but
there
are
many
who
would
not
forget
she
is
a
and
would
not
like
to
be
always
taking
her
with
them
and
you
hef
lived
a
long
time
in
london
have
not
lived
long
enough
in
london
to
make
me
forget
my
friends
or
insult
them
sheila
said
with
proud
lips
and
yet
turning
to
the
window
to
hide
her
face
lass
i
did
not
mean
any
harm
whatever
her
father
said
gently
wass
saying
nothing
against
mairi
go
away
and
bring
her
into
the
room
sheila
and
we
will
see
what
we
can
do
now
and
if
there
is
a
theater
we
can
go
to
this
evening
and
i
must
go
out
too
to
buy
some
things
for
you
are
a
ferry
fine
lady
now
sheila
and
i
was
coming
away
in
such
a
is
your
luggage
papa
she
said
suddenly

mackenzie
looking
around
in
great
embarrassment

luggage
you
said
sheila
ay
well
it
wass
a
hurry
i
wass
in
when
i
came
away
for
this
man

have
to
pay
me

once
whatever
and
there
wass
no
time
for
any
luggage
oh
no
there

no
time
because
duncan
he
wass
late
with
the
boat
and
the
mare
she
had
a
shoe
to
put
on
and
and
oh
no
there
was
no
time
for
any
what
was
scarlett
about
to
let
you
come
away
like
that
said
sheila
well
scarlett
did
not
know
it
was
all
in
such
a
hurry
now
go
and
bring
in
mairi
sheila
and
we
will
speak
about
the
but
there
was
to
be
no
theatre
for
any
of
them
that
evening
sheila
was
just
about
to
leave
the
room
to
summon
mairi
when
the
small
girl
who
had
let
mackenzie
into
the
house
appeared
and
said
there
is
a
young
woman
below
who
wishes
to
see
you
she
has
a
message
to
you
from
paterson
sheila
said
wondering
how
should
have
been
entrusted
with
any
such
commission
you
please
ask
her
to
come
up
the
girl
came
looking
rather
frightened
and
much
out
of
breath
paterson
has
sent
me
to
tell
you
and
would
you
please
come
as
soon
as
it
is
convenient
mrs
lavender
has
died
it
was
quite
sudden
only
she
recovered
a
little
after
the
fit
and
then
sank
the
doctor
is
there
now
but
he
in
time
it
was
all
so
sudden
will
you
please
come
around
i
shall
be
there
directly
said
sheila
too
bewildered
and
stunned
to
think
of
the
possibility
of
meeting
her
husband
there
the
girl
left
and
sheila
still
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
apparently
stupefied
that
old
woman
had
got
into
such
a
habit
of
talking
about
her
approaching
death
that
sheila
had
ceased
to
believe
her
and
had
grown
to
fancy
that
these
morbid
speculations
were
indulged
in
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
shocking
bystanders
but
a
dead
man
or
a
dead
woman
is
suddenly
invested
with
a
great
solemnity
and
sheila
with
a
pang
of
remorse
thought
of
the
fashion
in
which
she
had
suspected
this
old
woman
of
a
godless
hypocrisy
she
felt
too
that
she
had
unjustly
disliked
mrs
lavender
that
she
had
feared
to
go
near
her
and
blamed
her
unfairly
for
many
things
that
had
happened
in
her
own
way
that
old
woman
in
kensington
gore
had
been
kind
to
her
perhaps
the
girl
was
a
little
ashamed
of
herself
at
this
moment
that
she
did
not
cry
her
father
went
out
with
her
and
up
to
the
house
with
the
dusty
ivy
and
the
red
curtains
how
strangely
like
was
the
aspect
of
the
house
inside
to
the
very
picture
that
mrs
lavender
had
herself
drawn
of
her
death
sheila
could
remember
all
the
ghastly
details
that
the
old
woman
seemed
to
have
a
malicious
delight
in
describing
and
here
they
were
the
shutters
drawn
down
the
servants
walking
about
on
the
strange
silence
in
one
particular
room
the
little
shriveled
old
body
lay
quite
still
and
calm
now
and
yet
as
sheila
went
to
the
bedside
she
could
hardly
believe
that
within
that
forehead
there
was
not
some
consciousness
of
the
scene
around
lying
almost
in
the
same
position
the
old
woman
with
a
sardonic
smile
on
her
face
had
spoken
of
the
time
when
she
should
be
speechless
sightless
and
deaf
while
paterson
would
go
about
stealthily
as
if
she
was
afraid
the
corpse
would
hear
was
it
possible
to
believe
that
the
dead
body
was
not
conscious
at
this
moment
that
paterson
was
really
going
about
in
that
fashion
that
the
blinds
were
down
friends
standing
some
little
distance
from
the
bed
a
couple
of
doctors
talking
to
each
other
in
the
passage
outside
they
went
into
another
room
and
then
sheila
with
a
sudden
shiver
remembered
that
soon
her
husband
would
be
coming
and
might
meet
her
and
her
father
there
have
sent
for
mr
lavender
she
said
calmly
to
paterson
paterson
said
with
more
than
her
ordinary
gravity
and
formality
did
not
know
where
to
send
for
him
he
left
london
some
days
ago
perhaps
you
would
read
the
letter
she
offered
sheila
an
open
letter
the
girl
saw
that
it
was
in
her
handwriting
but
she
shrank
from
it
as
though
she
were
violating
the
secrets
of
the
grave
no
she
said
can
not
do
lavender
meant
you
to
read
it
after
she
had
had
her
will
altered
she
told
me
so
it
is
a
very
sad
thing
that
she
did
not
live
to
carry
out
her
intentions
for
she
has
been
inquiring
these
last
few
days
as
to
how
she
could
leave
everything
to
you
which
she
intended
and
now
the
other
will
talk
about
that
said
sheila
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
dead
body
in
the
other
room
would
be
laughing
hideously
if
only
it
could
at
this
fulfillment
of
all
the
sardonic
prophecies
that
mrs
lavender
used
to
make
beg
your
pardon
paterson
said
in
the
same
formal
way
as
if
she
was
a
machine
set
to
work
in
a
particular
direction
only
mentioned
the
will
to
explain
why
mrs
lavender
wished
you
to
read
this
the
letter
sheila
said
her
father
the
girl
took
it
and
carried
it
to
the
window
while
she
was
there
old
mackenzie
who
had
fewer
scruples
about
such
matters
and
who
had
the
curiosity
natural
to
a
man
of
the
world
said
to
paterson
not
loud
enough
for
sheila
to
overhear
suppose
then
the
poor
old
lady
has
left
her
property
to
her
nephew
no
sir
said
paterson
somewhat
sadly
for
she
fancied
she
was
the
bearer
of
bad
news
had
a
will
drawn
out
only
a
short
time
ago
and
nearly
everything
is
left
to
ingram
said
the
woman
amazed
to
see
that
face
so
far
from
evincing
displeasure
seemed
to
be
as
delighted
as
it
was
surprised
sir
said
paterson
was
one
of
the
witnesses
but
mrs
lavender
changed
her
mind
and
was
very
anxious
that
everything
should
go
to
your
daughter
if
it
could
be
done
and
appleyard
sir
was
to
come
here
has
mr
lavender
got
no
money
whatever
said
father
with
an
air
that
convinced
paterson
that
he
was
a
revengeful
man
and
was
glad
his
should
be
so
severely
punished
know
sir
she
replied
careful
not
to
go
beyond
her
own
sphere
sheila
came
back
from
the
window
she
had
taken
a
long
time
to
read
and
ponder
over
that
letter
though
it
was
not
a
lengthy
one
this
was
what
frank
lavender
had
written
to
his
aunt
dear
aunt
lavender
i
suppose
when
you
read
this
you
will
think
i
am
in
a
bad
temper
because
of
what
you
said
to
me
it
is
not
so
but
i
am
leaving
london
and
i
wish
to
hand
over
to
you
before
i
go
the
charge
of
my
house
and
to
ask
you
take
possession
of
everything
in
it
that
does
not
belong
to
sheila
these
things
are
yours
as
you
know
and
i
have
to
thank
you
very
much
for
the
loan
of
them
i
have
to
thank
you
for
the
far
too
liberal
allowance
you
have
made
me
for
many
years
back
will
you
think
i
have
gone
mad
if
i
ask
you
to
stop
that
now
the
fact
is
i
am
going
to
have
a
try
at
earning
something
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
and
to
make
the
experiment
satisfactory
i
start
morning
for
a
district
in
the
west
highlands
where
the
most
ingenious
fellow
i
know
get
a
penny
loaf
on
credit
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
aunt
lavender
i
wish
i
had
made
better
use
of
your
kindness
so
just
now
and
if
ever
i
come
back
to
london
again
i
shall
call
on
you
and
thank
you
in
person
am
your
affectionate
nephew
so
far
the
letter
was
almost
there
was
no
reference
to
the
causes
which
were
sending
him
away
from
london
and
which
had
already
driven
him
to
this
extraordinary
resolution
about
the
money
he
had
got
from
his
aunt
but
at
the
end
of
the
letter
there
was
a
brief
postscript
apparently
written
at
the
last
moment
the
words
of
which
were
these
kind
to
sheila
be
as
kind
to
her
as
i
have
been
cruel
to
her
in
going
away
from
her
i
feel
as
though
i
were
exiled
by
man
and
forsaken
by
she
came
back
from
the
window
the
letter
in
her
hand
think
you
may
read
it
too
papa
she
said
for
she
was
anxious
that
her
father
should
know
that
lavender
had
voluntarily
surrendered
this
money
before
he
was
deprived
of
it
then
she
went
back
to
the
window
the
slow
rain
fell
from
the
dismal
skies
on
the
pavement
and
the
railings
and
the
now
almost
leafless
trees
the
atmosphere
was
filled
with
a
thin
white
mist
and
the
people
going
by
were
hidden
under
umbrellas
it
was
a
dreary
picture
enough
and
yet
sheila
was
thinking
of
how
much
drearier
such
a
day
would
be
on
some
lonely
coast
in
the
north
with
the
hills
obscured
behind
the
rain
and
the
sea
beating
hopelessly
on
the
sand
she
thought
of
some
small
and
damp
highland
cottage
with
narrow
windows
a
smell
of
wet
wood
about
and
the
monotonous
drip
from
over
the
door
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
a
stranger
there
would
be
very
lonely
not
knowing
the
ways
or
the
speech
of
the
simple
folk
careless
perhaps
of
his
own
comfort
and
only
listening
to
the
plashing
of
the
sea
and
the
incessant
rain
on
the
bushes
and
on
the
pebbles
of
the
beach
was
there
any
picture
of
desolation
she
thought
like
that
of
a
sea
under
rain
with
a
slight
fog
obscuring
the
air
and
with
no
wind
to
stir
the
pulse
with
the
noise
of
waves
and
if
frank
lavender
had
only
gone
as
far
as
the
western
highlands
and
was
living
in
some
house
on
the
coast
how
sad
and
still
the
atlantic
must
have
been
all
this
wet
forenoon
with
the
islands
of
colonsay
and
oronsay
lying
remote
and
gray
and
misty
in
the
far
and
desolate
plain
of
the
sea
will
take
a
great
deal
of
responsibility
from
me
sir
patterson
said
to
old
mackenzie
who
was
absently
thinking
of
all
the
strange
possibilities
now
opening
out
before
him
you
will
tell
me
what
is
to
be
done
mrs
lavender
had
no
relatives
in
london
except
her
yes
said
mackenzie
waking
up
yes
we
will
see
what
is
to
be
done
there
will
be
the
boat
wanted
for
the
funeral
he
recalled
himself
with
an
impatient
gesture
me
he
said
was
i
saying
you
must
ask
some
one
else
you
must
ask
ingram
hef
you
not
sent
for
ingram
yes
sir
i
have
sent
to
him
and
he
will
most
likely
come
in
the
there
are
the
executors
mentioned
in
the
will
that
wass
something
you
should
know
about
and
they
will
tell
you
what
to
do
as
for
me
it
is
ferry
little
i
will
know
about
such
your
daughter
sir
suggested
paterson
tell
me
what
she
thinks
should
be
done
with
the
rooms
and
as
for
luncheon
sir
if
you
would
wait
my
daughter
said
mackenzie
as
if
struck
by
a
new
idea
but
determined
all
the
same
that
sheila
should
not
have
this
new
responsibility
thrust
on
her
daughter
well
you
was
saying
mem
that
my
daughter
would
help
you
oh
yes
but
she
is
a
ferry
young
thing
and
you
was
saying
we
must
hef
luncheon
oh
yes
but
we
will
not
give
you
so
much
trouble
and
we
hef
luncheon
ordered
at
the
other
house
whatever
and
there
is
the
young
girl
there
that
we
can
not
leave
all
by
herself
and
you
hef
a
great
experience
mem
and
whatever
you
do
that
will
be
right
do
not
have
any
fear
of
that
and
i
will
come
around
when
you
want
me
oh
yes
i
will
come
around
at
any
time
but
my
daughter
she
is
a
ferry
young
thing
and
she
would
be
of
no
use
to
you
whatever
none
whatever
and
when
ingram
comes
you
will
send
him
around
to
the
place
where
my
daughter
is
for
we
will
want
to
see
him
if
he
hass
the
time
to
come
where
is
shei
where
is
my
daughter
sheila
had
quietly
left
the
room
and
stolen
into
the
silent
chamber
in
which
the
dead
woman
lay
they
found
her
standing
close
by
the
bedside
almost
in
a
trance
said
her
father
taking
her
hand
away
now
like
a
good
girl
it
is
no
use
your
waiting
here
and
mairi
what
will
mairi
be
doing
she
suffered
herself
to
be
led
away
and
they
went
home
and
had
luncheon
but
the
girl
could
not
eat
for
the
notion
that
somewhere
or
other
a
pair
of
eyes
were
looking
at
her
and
were
hideously
laughing
at
her
as
if
to
remind
her
of
the
prophecy
of
that
old
woman
that
her
friends
would
sit
down
to
a
comfortable
meal
and
begin
to
wonder
what
sort
of
mourning
they
would
have
it
was
not
until
the
evening
that
ingram
called
he
had
been
greatly
surprised
to
hear
from
paterson
that
mackenzie
had
been
there
along
with
his
daughter
and
he
now
expected
to
find
the
old
king
of
borva
in
a
towering
passion
he
found
him
on
the
contrary
as
bland
and
as
pleased
as
decency
would
admit
of
in
view
of
the
tragedy
that
had
occurred
in
the
morning
and
indeed
as
mackenzie
had
never
seen
mrs
lavender
there
was
less
reason
why
he
should
wear
the
outward
semblance
of
grief
father
asked
her
to
go
out
of
the
room
for
a
little
while
and
when
she
and
mairi
had
gone
he
said
cheerfully
ingram
and
it
is
a
rich
man
you
are
at
paterson
said
she
had
told
you
ingram
said
with
a
shrug
never
expected
to
find
me
rich
did
you
said
mackenzie
frankly
it
is
a
ferry
good
thing
oh
yes
it
is
a
ferry
good
thing
to
hef
money
and
be
independent
of
people
and
you
will
make
a
good
use
of
it
i
seem
disposed
sir
to
regret
that
lavender
has
been
robbed
of
what
should
have
belonged
to
him
not
at
all
said
mackenzie
gravely
and
cautiously
for
he
did
not
want
his
plans
to
be
displayed
prematurely
i
hef
no
quarrel
with
him
so
you
will
not
think
i
am
glad
to
hef
the
money
taken
away
for
that
oh
no
i
hef
seen
a
great
many
men
and
women
and
it
was
no
strange
thing
that
these
two
young
ones
living
all
by
themselves
in
london
should
hef
a
quarrel
but
it
will
come
all
right
again
if
we
do
not
make
too
much
about
it
if
they
like
one
another
they
will
soon
come
together
again
tek
my
word
for
it
ingram
and
i
hef
seen
a
great
many
men
and
women
and
as
for
the
money
well
as
for
the
money
i
hef
plenty
for
my
sheila
and
she
will
not
starve
when
i
die
no
nor
before
that
either
and
as
for
the
poor
old
woman
that
has
died
i
am
ferry
glad
she
left
her
money
to
one
that
will
make
a
good
use
of
it
and
will
not
throw
it
away
but
you
know
mackenzie
you
are
congratulating
me
without
cause
i
will
tell
you
how
the
matter
stands
the
money
does
not
belong
to
me
at
all
mrs
lavender
never
intended
it
should
it
was
meant
to
go
to
sheila
i
know
i
know
said
mackenzie
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
wass
hearing
all
that
from
the
woman
at
the
house
but
how
will
you
know
what
mrs
lavender
intended
you
hef
only
that
story
for
it
and
here
is
the
will
and
you
hef
the
money
and
and
mackenzie
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
said
with
a
sudden
vehemence
and
by
kott
you
shall
keep
it
ingram
was
a
trifle
startled
look
here
sir
he
said
in
a
tone
of
expostulation
make
a
mistake
i
myself
know
intentions
i
go
by
any
story
of
mrs
lavender
made
over
the
money
to
me
with
the
express
injunctions
to
place
it
at
the
disposal
of
sheila
whenever
i
should
see
fit
oh
no
mistake
about
it
so
you
need
not
protest
sir
if
the
money
belonged
to
me
i
should
be
delighted
to
keep
it
no
man
in
the
country
more
desires
to
be
rich
than
i
so
fancy
i
am
flinging
away
a
fortune
out
of
generosity
if
any
rich
and
old
lady
will
send
me
five
thousand
or
ten
thousand
pounds
you
will
see
how
i
shall
stick
to
it
but
the
simple
truth
is
this
money
is
not
mine
at
all
it
was
never
intended
to
be
mine
it
belongs
to
ingram
talked
in
a
very
way
the
old
man
feared
what
he
said
was
true
it
is
a
ferry
good
story
said
mackenzie
cautiously
maybe
it
is
all
true
and
you
wass
saying
you
would
like
to
hef
money
most
decidedly
should
like
to
have
then
said
the
old
man
watching
his
face
is
no
one
to
say
that
the
story
is
true
and
who
will
believe
it
and
if
sheila
wass
to
come
to
you
and
say
she
did
not
believe
it
and
she
would
not
have
the
money
from
you
you
would
have
to
keep
it
eh
sallow
face
blushed
crimson
know
what
you
mean
he
said
stiffly
you
propose
to
pervert
the
mind
and
make
me
a
party
to
a
fraud
there
is
no
use
getting
into
an
anger
said
mackenzie
suavely
common
sense
will
do
as
well
whatever
and
there
wass
no
perversion
and
there
wass
no
fraud
talked
about
it
wass
just
this
ingram
that
if
the
old
will
leaves
you
her
property
who
will
you
be
getting
to
believe
that
she
did
not
mean
to
give
it
to
you
tell
you
now
whom
she
meant
to
give
it
to
said
ingram
still
somewhat
hotly
yes
oh
yes
that
iss
ferry
well
but
who
will
believe
it
heavens
sir
who
will
believe
i
could
be
such
a
fool
as
to
fling
away
this
property
if
it
belonged
to
me
will
think
you
a
fool
to
do
it
now
yes
that
is
sure
enough
said
mackenzie
care
what
they
think
and
it
seems
rather
odd
mackenzie
that
you
should
be
trying
to
deprive
your
own
daughter
of
what
belongs
to
my
daughter
is
ferry
well
off
whatever
she
does
not
want
any
money
said
mackenzie
and
then
a
new
notion
struck
him
you
tell
me
this
ingram
if
mrs
lavender
left
you
her
property
in
this
way
what
for
did
she
want
to
change
her
will
eh
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
refused
to
take
the
responsibility
she
was
anxious
to
have
this
money
given
to
sheila
so
that
lavender
should
not
touch
it
and
i
think
it
was
a
wise
intention
for
there
is
not
a
prouder
man
in
the
world
than
lavender
and
i
know
that
sheila
would
not
consent
to
hold
a
penny
that
did
not
equally
belong
to
him
however
that
was
her
notion
and
i
was
the
first
victim
of
it
i
protested
against
it
and
i
suppose
that
set
her
to
inquiring
whether
the
money
could
not
be
absolutely
bequeathed
to
sheila
direct
i
know
anything
about
it
myself
but
how
the
matter
stands
as
far
as
i
am
you
will
think
it
over
ingram
said
mackenzie
quietly
will
think
it
over
and
be
in
no
hurry
it
is
not
every
man
that
has
a
lot
of
money
given
to
him
and
it
is
no
wrong
to
my
sheila
at
all
for
she
will
have
quite
plenty
and
she
would
be
ferry
sorry
to
take
the
money
away
from
you
that
is
sure
enough
and
you
will
not
be
hasty
ingram
but
be
cautious
and
reasonable
and
you
will
see
the
money
will
do
you
far
more
good
than
it
would
do
ingram
began
to
think
that
he
had
tied
a
millstone
around
his
neck
chapter
xxiii
in
exile
one
evening
in
the
olden
time
lavender
and
sheila
and
ingram
and
old
mackenzie
were
all
sitting
high
up
on
the
rocks
near
borvapost
chatting
to
each
other
and
watching
the
red
light
pale
on
the
bosom
of
the
atlantic
as
the
sun
sank
behind
the
edge
of
the
world
ingram
was
smoking
a
wooden
pipe
lavender
sat
with
hand
in
his
the
old
king
of
borva
was
discoursing
of
the
fishing
populations
around
the
western
coasts
and
their
various
ways
and
habits
wish
i
could
have
seen
tarbert
lavender
was
saying
the
iona
just
passed
the
mouth
of
the
little
harbor
as
she
comes
up
loch
fine
i
know
two
or
three
men
who
go
there
every
year
to
paint
the
of
the
place
it
is
an
odd
little
place
it
said
mackenzie
was
wanting
to
know
about
tarbert
ah
well
it
is
a
better
place
now
but
a
year
or
two
ago
it
was
ferry
like
hell
oh
yes
it
was
sheila
so
you
need
not
say
anything
and
this
wass
the
way
of
it
mr
lavender
that
the
trawling
was
not
made
legal
then
and
the
men
they
were
just
like
devils
with
the
swearing
and
the
drinking
and
the
fighting
that
went
on
and
if
you
went
into
the
harbor
in
the
open
day
you
would
find
them
drunk
and
fighting
and
some
of
them
with
blood
on
their
faces
for
it
wass
a
ferry
wild
time
it
wass
many
a
one
will
say
that
the
would
run
down
the
police
boat
some
dark
night
and
what
was
the
use
of
catching
the
trawlers
now
and
again
and
taking
their
boats
and
their
nets
to
be
sold
at
greenock
when
they
went
themselves
over
to
greenock
to
the
auction
and
brought
them
back
oh
it
was
a
great
deal
of
money
they
made
then
i
hef
heard
of
a
crew
of
eight
men
getting
thirty
pounds
each
man
in
the
course
of
one
night
and
that
not
seldom
why
the
government
put
it
down
lavender
asked
you
see
mackenzie
answered
with
the
air
of
a
man
well
acquainted
with
the
difficulties
of
ruling
see
it
wass
not
quite
sure
that
the
trawling
did
much
harm
to
the
fishing
and
the
jackal
that
was
the
government
steamer
she
was
not
much
good
in
getting
the
better
of
the
who
are
ferry
good
with
their
boats
in
the
rowing
and
are
very
cunning
whatever
you
know
the
buying
boats
went
out
to
sea
and
took
the
herring
there
and
then
the
trawlers
they
would
sink
their
nets
and
come
home
in
the
morning
as
if
they
had
not
caught
one
fish
although
the
boat
would
be
white
with
the
scales
of
the
herring
and
what
is
more
sir
the
government
knew
ferry
well
that
if
trawling
was
put
down
then
there
would
be
a
ferry
good
many
murders
for
the
when
they
came
home
to
drink
whisky
and
wash
the
whisky
down
with
porter
they
were
ready
to
fight
must
be
a
delightful
place
to
live
in
lavender
said
but
it
is
ferry
different
now
mackenzie
continued
different
the
men
they
are
nearly
all
good
templars
now
and
there
is
no
drinking
whatever
and
there
is
and
such
things
and
the
place
is
ferry
quiet
and
hear
ingram
remarked
good
people
attribute
the
change
to
moral
suasion
and
that
wicked
people
put
it
down
to
want
of
this
boy
will
have
to
be
put
to
bed
sheila
said
mackenzie
answered
is
not
so
much
money
in
the
place
as
there
wass
in
the
old
times
the
shopkeepers
do
not
make
so
much
money
as
before
when
the
men
were
wild
and
drunk
in
the
daytime
and
had
plenty
to
spend
when
the
did
not
catch
them
but
the
fishermen
they
are
ferry
much
better
without
the
money
and
i
can
say
for
them
mr
lavender
that
there
is
no
better
fishermen
on
the
coast
they
are
very
fine
tall
men
and
they
are
ferry
well
dressed
in
their
blue
clothes
and
they
are
manly
fellows
whether
they
are
drunk
or
whether
they
are
sober
now
look
at
this
sir
that
in
the
worst
of
weather
they
will
neffer
tek
whisky
with
them
when
they
go
out
to
the
sea
at
night
for
they
think
it
is
cowardly
and
they
are
ferry
fine
fellows
and
gentlemanly
in
their
ways
and
they
are
ferry
to
have
heard
that
of
them
on
all
hands
lavender
said
some
day
i
hope
to
put
their
civility
and
to
the
that
was
merely
the
idle
conversation
of
a
summer
evening
no
one
paid
any
further
attention
to
it
nor
did
even
lavender
himself
think
again
of
his
hope
of
some
day
visiting
tarbert
let
us
now
shift
the
scene
of
this
narrative
to
tarbert
itself
when
you
pass
from
the
broad
and
blue
waters
of
loch
fyne
into
the
narrow
and
rocky
channel
leading
into
tarbert
harbor
you
find
before
you
an
almost
circular
bay
around
which
stretches
an
irregular
line
of
white
houses
there
is
an
abundance
of
in
the
harbor
lying
in
careless
and
picturesque
groups
with
their
brown
hulls
and
spars
sending
a
ruddy
reflection
down
on
the
lapping
water
which
is
green
under
the
shadow
of
each
boat
along
the
shores
stand
the
tall
poles
on
which
the
fishermen
dry
their
nets
and
above
these
on
the
summit
of
a
rocky
crag
rise
the
ruins
of
an
old
castle
with
the
daylight
shining
through
the
empty
windows
beyond
the
houses
again
lie
successive
lines
of
hills
at
this
moment
lit
up
by
shafts
of
sunlight
that
lend
a
glowing
warmth
and
richness
to
the
fine
colors
of
a
late
autumn
the
hills
are
red
and
brown
with
rusted
bracken
and
heather
and
here
and
there
the
smooth
waters
of
the
bay
catch
a
tinge
of
other
and
varied
hues
in
one
of
the
that
lie
almost
under
the
shadow
of
the
tall
crag
on
which
the
castle
ruins
stand
an
artist
has
put
a
ready
easel
and
is
apparently
busy
at
work
painting
a
group
of
boats
just
beyond
some
indication
of
the
rich
colors
of
the
craft
their
ruddy
sails
brown
nets
and
bladders
and
their
varnished
but
not
painted
hulls
already
appears
on
the
canvas
and
by
and
by
some
vision
may
arise
of
the
far
hills
in
their
soft
autumnal
tints
and
of
the
bold
blue
and
white
sky
moving
overhead
perhaps
the
old
man
who
is
smoking
in
the
stern
of
one
of
the
boats
has
been
placed
there
on
purpose
a
boy
seated
on
some
nets
occasionally
casts
an
anxious
glance
toward
the
painter
as
if
to
inquire
when
his
penance
will
be
over
a
small
open
boat
with
a
heap
of
stones
for
ballast
and
with
no
great
elegance
in
shape
of
rigging
comes
slowly
in
from
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
and
is
gently
run
alongside
the
boat
in
which
the
man
is
painting
a
young
fellow
with
voluminous
and
curly
brown
hair
who
has
dressed
himself
as
a
yachtsman
calls
out
do
you
know
the
white
rose
a
big
schooner
yacht
about
eighty
tons
i
should
lavender
said
without
turning
around
or
taking
his
eyes
off
the
canvas
is
she
either
he
or
his
skipper
hailed
me
just
now
and
wanted
to
know
whether
you
were
here
i
said
you
were
the
fellow
asked
me
if
i
was
going
into
the
harbor
i
said
i
was
so
he
gave
me
a
message
for
you
that
they
would
hang
about
outside
for
half
an
hour
or
so
if
you
would
go
out
with
them
and
take
a
run
up
to
take
you
out
you
want
to
look
here
lavender
said
the
young
man
seizing
hold
of
boat
and
causing
the
easel
to
shake
dangerously
asked
me
to
luncheon
you
go
then
was
the
only
reply
uttered
rather
absently
go
without
i
mean
to
the
younger
man
looked
vexed
for
a
moment
and
then
said
in
a
tone
of
expostulation
know
it
is
very
absurd
of
you
going
on
like
this
lavender
no
fellow
can
paint
decently
if
he
gets
out
of
bed
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
waits
for
daylight
to
rush
up
to
his
easel
how
many
hours
have
you
been
at
work
already
if
you
give
your
eyes
a
rest
they
will
get
to
a
dead
certainty
do
you
think
you
will
paint
the
whole
place
off
the
face
of
the
earth
now
that
the
other
fellows
have
gone
be
bothered
talking
with
you
johnny
make
me
throw
something
at
you
go
think
rather
mean
you
know
continued
the
persistent
johnny
a
fellow
like
you
who
need
it
to
come
and
fill
the
market
all
at
once
while
we
unfortunate
devils
can
scarcely
get
a
crust
and
there
are
two
heron
just
around
the
point
and
i
have
my
and
a
dozen
cartridges
away
that
was
all
the
answer
he
got
go
out
and
tell
lord
newstead
that
you
are
a
cantankerous
brute
i
suppose
have
the
decency
to
offer
me
luncheon
and
i
dare
say
i
could
get
him
a
shot
at
these
heron
you
are
a
fool
not
to
come
lavender
and
so
saying
the
young
man
pushed
out
again
and
he
was
heard
to
go
away
talking
to
himself
about
obstinate
idiots
and
greed
and
the
certainty
of
getting
a
shot
at
the
heron
when
he
had
quite
gone
lavender
who
had
scarcely
raised
his
eyes
from
his
work
suddenly
put
down
his
palette
and
brushes
he
almost
dropped
them
indeed
and
quickly
pat
up
both
his
hands
to
his
head
pressing
them
on
the
side
of
his
temples
the
old
fisherman
in
the
boat
beyond
noticed
this
strange
movement
and
forthwith
caught
a
rope
hauled
the
boat
across
a
stretch
of
water
and
then
came
scrambling
over
bowsprit
lowered
sails
and
nets
to
where
lavender
had
just
sat
down
there
anything
the
matter
sir
he
said
with
much
evidence
of
concern
head
is
a
little
bad
donald
lavender
said
still
pressing
his
hands
to
his
temples
as
if
to
get
rid
of
some
strange
feeling
wish
you
would
pull
in
to
the
shore
and
get
me
some
ay
said
the
old
man
hastily
scrambling
into
the
little
black
boat
lying
beside
the
smack
it
is
no
wonder
to
me
that
this
will
come
to
you
sir
for
i
hef
never
seen
any
of
the
gentlemen
so
long
at
the
pentin
as
you
from
the
morning
till
the
night
and
it
is
no
wonder
to
me
that
this
will
come
to
you
but
i
will
get
you
the
whushky
it
is
a
grand
thing
the
the
old
fisherman
was
not
long
in
getting
ashore
and
running
up
to
the
cottage
where
lavender
lived
and
getting
a
bottle
of
whisky
and
a
glass
then
he
got
down
to
the
boat
again
and
was
surprised
that
he
could
nowhere
see
mr
lavender
on
board
the
smack
perhaps
he
had
lain
down
on
the
nets
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
when
donald
got
out
to
the
smack
he
found
the
young
man
lying
insensible
his
face
white
and
his
teeth
clenched
with
something
of
a
cry
the
old
fisherman
jumped
into
the
boat
knelt
down
and
proceeded
in
a
fashion
to
force
some
whisky
into
mouth
ay
oh
yes
it
is
a
grand
thing
the
whushky
he
muttered
to
himself
yes
sir
you
must
hef
some
more
it
is
no
matter
if
you
will
choke
it
is
ferry
good
whushky
and
will
do
you
no
harm
whatever
and
oh
yes
sir
that
is
ferry
well
and
you
are
all
right
again
and
you
will
sit
quite
quiet
now
and
you
will
hef
a
little
more
the
young
man
looked
around
him
you
been
ashore
donald
oh
yes
i
suppose
so
did
i
tumble
well
all
right
now
it
was
the
glare
of
the
sea
that
made
me
giddy
take
a
dram
for
yourself
is
but
the
one
glass
sir
said
donald
who
had
picked
up
something
of
the
notions
of
gentlefolks
i
will
just
tek
the
bottle
and
so
to
avoid
drinking
out
of
the
same
glass
which
was
rather
a
small
one
he
was
good
enough
to
take
a
pull
and
a
strong
pull
at
the
black
bottle
then
he
heaved
a
sigh
and
wiped
the
top
of
the
bottle
with
his
sleeve
as
i
was
saying
sir
there
was
none
of
the
gentlemen
i
hef
effer
seen
in
tarbert
will
keep
at
the
pentin
so
long
ass
you
and
many
of
them
will
be
stronger
ass
you
and
will
be
more
accustomed
to
it
whatever
but
when
a
man
is
making
money
and
donald
shook
his
head
he
knew
it
was
useless
to
argue
i
am
not
making
money
donald
lavender
said
still
looking
a
trifle
pale
doubt
whether
i
have
made
as
much
as
you
have
since
i
came
to
yes
said
donald
contentedly
the
gentlemen
will
say
that
they
never
hef
any
money
but
wass
you
ever
with
them
when
they
could
not
get
a
dram
because
they
had
no
money
to
pay
for
it
test
of
impecuniosity
could
not
be
gainsaid
lavender
laughed
and
bade
him
get
back
into
the
other
boat
i
will
not
said
donald
sturdily
lavender
stared
at
him
no
you
wass
doing
quite
enough
the
day
already
or
you
would
not
hef
tumbled
into
the
boat
whatever
and
supposing
that
you
was
to
hef
tumbled
into
the
water
you
would
have
been
trooned
as
sure
as
you
wass
a
good
job
too
donald
said
the
younger
man
idly
looking
at
the
lapping
green
water
donald
shook
his
head
gravely
would
not
say
that
if
you
had
friends
of
yours
that
was
trooned
and
if
you
had
seen
them
when
they
went
down
in
the
say
it
is
an
easy
death
neffer
tried
it
that
said
that
said
the
old
fisherman
gloomily
wass
one
day
the
son
of
my
sister
wass
coming
over
from
saltcoats
but
i
hef
no
wish
to
speak
of
it
and
that
wass
but
one
among
ferry
many
that
i
have
long
is
it
since
you
were
in
the
lewis
did
you
say
lavender
asked
changing
the
subject
donald
was
accustomed
to
have
the
talk
suddenly
diverted
into
this
channel
he
could
not
tell
why
the
young
english
gentleman
wanted
him
continually
to
be
talking
about
the
lewis
it
is
many
and
many
a
year
ago
as
i
hef
said
and
you
will
know
far
more
about
the
lewis
than
i
will
but
stornoway
that
is
a
fine
big
town
and
i
hef
a
cousin
there
that
keeps
a
shop
and
is
a
very
rich
man
whatever
and
the
time
he
will
ask
me
to
come
and
see
him
and
if
the
lord
be
spared
maybe
i
will
some
mean
if
you
be
spared
ay
it
is
all
wan
said
donald
lavender
had
brought
with
him
some
bread
and
cheese
in
a
piece
of
paper
for
luncheon
and
this
store
of
frugal
provisions
having
been
opened
out
the
old
fisherman
was
invited
to
join
in
an
invitation
he
gravely
but
not
eagerly
accepted
he
took
off
his
blue
bonnet
and
said
grace
then
he
took
the
bread
and
cheese
in
his
hand
and
looked
around
inquiringly
there
was
a
stone
jar
of
water
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
that
was
not
what
donald
was
looking
after
lavender
handed
him
the
black
bottle
he
had
brought
out
from
the
cottage
which
was
more
to
his
mind
and
then
this
humble
meal
dispatched
the
old
man
was
persuaded
to
go
back
to
his
post
and
lavender
continued
his
work
the
short
afternoon
was
drawing
to
a
close
when
young
johnny
eyre
came
sailing
in
from
loch
fyne
himself
and
a
boy
of
ten
or
twelve
managing
that
crank
little
boat
with
its
sails
you
at
work
yet
lavender
he
said
never
saw
such
a
beggar
getting
quite
sort
of
luncheon
did
newstead
give
you
johnny
something
worth
going
for
i
can
tell
you
you
want
to
live
in
tarbert
for
a
month
or
two
to
find
out
the
value
of
decent
cooking
and
good
wine
he
was
awfully
surprised
when
i
described
this
place
to
him
he
believe
you
were
living
here
in
a
cottage
i
said
a
garret
for
i
pitched
it
hot
and
strong
mind
you
i
said
you
were
living
in
a
garret
that
you
never
saw
a
razor
and
lived
on
and
whisky
and
that
your
only
amusement
was
going
out
at
night
and
risking
your
neck
in
this
delightful
boat
of
mine
you
should
have
seen
him
examining
this
remarkable
vessel
and
there
were
two
ladies
on
board
and
they
were
asking
after
you
were
they
know
i
catch
their
names
when
i
was
introduced
but
the
noble
skipper
called
one
of
them
i
you
coming
ashore
lavender
you
see
to
work
right
i
shall
put
my
traps
ashore
and
then
have
a
run
with
you
down
loch
fyne
if
you
like
i
like
said
the
handsome
lad
frankly
looking
rather
squally
about
it
seems
to
me
bent
on
drowning
yourself
before
those
other
fellows
went
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
you
had
committed
a
they
really
lavender
said
with
little
interest
if
you
go
away
and
live
in
that
wild
place
you
were
talking
of
during
the
winter
they
will
be
quite
sure
of
it
why
man
come
back
with
your
hair
turned
white
you
might
as
well
think
of
living
by
yourself
at
the
arctic
neither
johnny
eyre
nor
any
of
the
men
who
had
just
left
tarbert
knew
anything
of
frank
recent
history
and
lavender
himself
was
not
disposed
to
be
communicative
they
would
know
soon
enough
when
they
went
up
to
london
in
the
meantime
they
were
surprised
to
find
that
habits
were
very
singularly
altered
he
had
grown
miserly
they
laughed
when
he
told
them
he
had
no
money
and
he
did
not
seek
to
persuade
them
of
the
fact
but
it
was
clear
at
all
events
that
none
of
them
lived
so
frugally
or
worked
so
anxiously
as
he
then
when
his
work
was
done
in
the
evening
and
when
they
met
alternately
at
each
rooms
to
dine
off
mutton
and
potatoes
with
a
glass
of
whisky
and
a
pipe
and
a
game
of
cards
to
follow
what
was
the
meaning
of
those
sudden
fits
of
silence
that
would
strike
in
when
the
general
hilarity
was
at
its
pitch
and
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
utter
recklessness
he
displayed
when
they
would
go
out
of
an
evening
in
their
open
sailing
boats
to
shoot
or
make
a
voyage
along
the
rocky
coast
in
the
dead
of
night
to
wait
for
the
dawn
to
show
them
the
haunts
of
the
seals
the
lavender
they
had
met
occasionally
in
london
was
a
fastidious
dilettante
and
yet
not
disagreeable
fellow
this
man
was
almost
pathetically
anxious
about
his
work
oftentimes
he
was
morose
and
silent
and
then
again
there
was
no
sort
of
danger
or
difficulty
he
was
not
ready
to
plunge
into
when
they
were
sailing
about
the
coast
they
could
not
make
it
out
but
the
joke
among
themselves
was
that
he
had
committed
a
murder
and
therefore
he
was
reckless
this
johnny
eyre
was
not
much
of
an
artist
but
he
liked
the
society
of
artists
he
had
a
little
money
of
his
own
plenty
of
time
and
a
love
of
boating
and
shooting
and
so
he
had
pitched
his
tent
at
tarbert
and
was
proud
to
cherish
the
delusion
that
he
was
working
hard
and
earning
fame
and
wealth
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
never
earned
anything
but
he
had
very
good
spirits
and
living
in
tarbert
is
cheap
from
the
moment
that
lavender
had
come
to
the
place
johnny
eyre
had
made
him
his
special
companion
he
had
a
great
respect
for
a
man
who
could
shoot
anything
anywhere
and
when
he
and
lavender
came
back
together
from
a
cruise
there
was
no
use
saying
which
had
actually
done
the
brilliant
deeds
the
evidence
of
which
was
carried
ashore
but
lavender
oddly
enough
knew
little
about
sailing
and
johnny
was
pleased
to
assume
the
airs
of
an
instructor
on
this
point
his
only
difficulty
being
that
his
pupil
had
more
than
the
ordinary
hardihood
of
an
ignoramus
and
was
rather
inclined
to
do
reckless
things
even
after
he
had
sufficient
skill
to
know
that
they
were
dangerous
lavender
got
into
the
small
boat
taking
his
canvas
with
him
but
leaving
his
easel
in
the
he
pulled
himself
and
johnny
eyre
ashore
they
scrambled
up
the
rocks
and
into
the
road
and
then
they
went
into
the
small
white
cottage
in
which
lavender
lived
the
picture
was
for
greater
safety
left
in
which
already
contained
about
a
dozen
canvases
with
sketches
in
various
stages
on
them
then
he
went
out
to
his
friend
again
had
a
long
day
johnny
i
wish
go
out
with
me
the
excitement
of
a
squall
would
clear
brain
i
go
out
if
you
like
eyre
said
i
shall
take
very
good
care
to
run
in
before
the
squall
comes
if
any
about
i
think
there
will
be
after
all
i
fancied
i
saw
a
flash
of
lightning
about
half
an
hour
ago
down
in
the
south
but
nothing
has
come
of
it
there
are
some
curlew
about
and
the
guillemots
are
in
thousands
you
seem
to
care
about
shooting
guillemots
lavender
you
see
potting
a
bird
that
is
sitting
on
the
water
said
lavender
with
a
shrug
it
as
easy
as
you
might
imagine
of
course
you
could
kill
them
if
you
liked
but
everybody
such
a
swell
as
you
are
with
a
gun
and
mind
you
uncommonly
awkward
to
catch
moment
for
firing
when
the
bird
goes
bobbing
up
and
down
on
the
waves
disappearing
altogether
every
second
i
think
very
good
fun
myself
very
exciting
when
you
know
the
moment
the
bird
will
dive
and
whether
you
can
afford
to
go
any
nearer
and
as
for
shooting
them
on
the
water
you
have
to
do
that
for
when
do
you
get
a
chance
of
shooting
them
flying
see
much
necessity
for
shooting
them
at
any
time
said
lavender
as
he
and
eyre
went
down
to
the
shore
again
i
am
glad
to
see
you
get
some
amusement
out
of
it
have
you
got
cartridges
with
you
is
your
gun
in
the
boat
come
along
have
a
run
out
when
they
had
pulled
out
again
to
that
craft
with
its
stone
ballast
and
big
brown
mainsail
the
boy
was
sent
ashore
and
the
two
companions
set
out
by
themselves
by
this
time
the
sun
had
gone
down
and
a
strange
green
twilight
was
shining
over
the
sea
as
they
got
farther
out
the
dusky
shores
seemed
to
have
a
pale
mist
hanging
around
them
but
there
were
no
clouds
on
the
hills
for
a
clear
sky
shone
overhead
awaiting
the
coming
of
the
stars
strange
indeed
was
the
silence
out
here
broken
only
by
the
lapping
of
the
water
on
the
sides
of
the
boat
and
the
calling
of
birds
in
the
distance
far
away
the
orange
ray
of
a
lighthouse
began
to
quiver
in
the
lambent
dusk
the
pale
green
light
on
the
waves
did
not
die
out
but
the
shadows
grew
darker
so
that
eyre
with
his
gun
close
at
hand
could
not
make
out
his
groups
of
guillemots
although
he
heard
them
calling
all
around
they
had
come
out
too
late
indeed
for
any
such
purpose
thither
on
those
beautiful
evenings
after
his
work
was
over
lavender
was
accustomed
to
come
either
by
himself
or
with
his
present
companion
johnny
eyre
did
not
intrude
on
his
solitude
he
was
invariably
too
eager
to
get
a
shot
his
chief
delight
being
to
get
to
the
bow
to
let
the
boat
drift
for
a
while
silently
through
the
waves
so
that
she
might
come
unawares
on
some
flock
of
lavender
sitting
in
the
stern
with
the
tiller
in
his
hand
was
really
alone
in
this
world
of
water
and
sky
with
all
the
majesty
of
the
night
and
the
stars
around
him
and
on
these
occasions
he
used
to
sit
and
dream
of
the
beautiful
time
long
ago
in
loch
roag
when
nights
such
as
these
used
to
come
over
the
atlantic
and
find
sheila
and
himself
sailing
on
the
peaceful
waters
or
seated
high
up
on
the
rocks
listening
to
the
murmur
of
the
tide
here
was
the
same
strange
silence
the
same
solemn
and
pale
light
in
the
sky
the
same
mystery
of
the
moving
plain
all
around
them
that
seemed
somehow
to
be
alive
and
yet
voiceless
and
sad
many
a
time
his
heart
became
so
full
of
recollections
that
he
had
almost
called
aloud
sheila
and
waited
for
the
sea
and
the
sky
to
answer
him
with
the
sound
of
her
voice
in
these
days
he
had
pleased
himself
with
the
fancy
that
the
girl
was
somehow
the
product
of
all
the
beautiful
aspects
of
nature
around
her
it
was
the
sea
that
was
in
her
eyes
it
was
the
fair
sunlight
that
shone
in
her
face
the
breath
of
her
life
was
the
breath
of
the
moorland
winds
he
had
written
verses
about
this
fancy
of
his
and
he
had
conveyed
them
secretly
to
her
sure
that
she
at
least
would
find
no
defects
in
them
and
many
a
time
far
away
from
loch
roag
and
from
sheila
lines
of
this
conceit
would
wander
through
his
brain
set
to
the
saddest
of
all
music
the
music
of
irreparable
loss
what
did
they
say
to
him
now
that
he
recalled
them
like
some
voice
out
of
the
strange
past
for
she
and
the
clouds
and
the
breezes
were
one
and
the
hills
and
the
sea
had
conspired
with
the
sun
to
charm
and
bewilder
all
men
with
the
grace
they
combined
and
conferred
on
her
wonderful
face
the
sea
lapped
around
the
boat
the
green
light
on
the
waves
grew
somehow
less
intense
in
the
silence
the
first
of
the
stars
came
out
and
somehow
the
time
in
which
he
had
seen
sheila
in
these
rare
and
magical
colors
seemed
to
become
more
and
more
remote
an
angel
in
passing
looked
downward
and
smiled
and
carried
to
heaven
the
fame
of
the
child
and
then
what
the
waves
and
the
sky
and
the
sun
and
the
tremulous
breath
of
the
hills
had
begun
required
but
one
touch
to
finish
the
whole
god
loved
her
and
gave
her
a
beautiful
soul
and
what
had
he
done
with
this
rare
treasure
intrusted
to
him
his
companions
jesting
among
themselves
had
said
that
he
had
committed
a
murder
in
his
own
heart
there
was
something
at
this
moment
of
a
remorse
johnny
eyre
uttered
a
short
cry
lavender
looked
ahead
and
saw
that
some
black
object
was
disappearing
among
the
waves
a
fright
i
got
eyre
said
with
a
laugh
never
saw
the
fellow
come
near
and
he
came
up
just
below
the
bowsprit
he
came
keeling
over
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
i
say
lavender
i
think
we
might
as
well
cut
it
now
my
eyes
are
quite
bewildered
with
the
light
on
the
water
i
make
out
a
kraken
if
it
was
coming
across
our
be
in
a
hurry
johnny
put
her
out
a
bit
and
then
let
her
drift
back
i
want
to
tell
you
a
all
right
he
said
and
so
they
put
her
head
around
and
soon
she
was
lying
over
before
the
breeze
and
slowly
drawing
away
from
those
outlines
of
the
coast
which
showed
them
where
tarbert
harbor
cut
into
the
land
and
then
once
more
they
let
her
drift
and
young
eyre
took
a
nip
of
whisky
and
settled
himself
so
as
to
hear
story
whatever
it
might
be
knew
i
was
married
you
ever
wonder
why
my
wife
did
not
come
here
should
i
wonder
plenty
of
fellows
have
to
spend
half
the
year
apart
from
their
wives
the
only
thing
in
your
case
i
understand
was
the
necessity
for
your
doing
it
for
you
know
all
nonsense
about
your
want
of
nonsense
johnny
but
now
if
you
like
i
will
tell
you
why
my
wife
has
never
come
then
he
told
the
story
out
there
under
the
stars
with
no
thought
of
interruption
for
there
was
a
world
of
moving
water
around
them
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
let
any
one
into
his
confidence
and
perhaps
the
darkness
aided
his
revelations
but
at
any
rate
he
went
over
all
the
old
time
until
it
seemed
to
his
companion
that
he
was
talking
to
himself
so
aimless
and
desultory
were
his
pathetic
reminiscences
he
called
her
sheila
though
eyre
had
never
heard
her
name
he
spoke
of
her
father
as
though
eyre
must
have
known
him
and
yet
this
rambling
series
of
confessions
and
and
tender
memories
did
form
a
certain
sort
of
narrative
so
that
the
young
fellow
sitting
quietly
in
the
boat
there
got
a
pretty
fair
notion
of
what
had
happened
are
an
unlucky
fellow
he
said
to
lavender
never
heard
anything
like
that
but
you
know
you
must
have
exaggerated
a
good
deal
about
it
i
should
like
to
hear
her
story
i
am
sure
you
could
not
have
treated
her
like
knows
how
i
did
but
the
truth
is
just
as
i
have
told
you
and
although
i
was
blind
enough
at
the
time
i
can
read
the
whole
story
now
in
letters
of
fire
i
hope
you
will
never
have
such
a
thing
constantly
before
your
eyes
the
lad
was
silent
for
some
time
and
then
he
said
rather
timidly
you
think
lavender
she
knows
how
sorry
you
are
she
did
what
good
would
that
do
said
the
other
are
awfully
forgiving
you
know
johnny
said
in
a
hesitating
fashion
i
think
it
is
quite
fair
not
to
give
her
a
chance
a
chance
of
of
being
generous
you
know
you
know
i
think
the
better
a
woman
is
the
more
inclined
she
is
to
be
charitable
to
other
folks
who
be
quite
up
to
the
mark
you
know
and
you
see
it
every
one
who
can
claim
to
be
always
doing
the
right
thing
and
the
next
best
thing
to
that
is
to
be
sorry
for
what
done
and
try
to
do
better
rather
cheeky
you
know
my
advising
you
or
trying
to
make
you
pluck
up
your
spirits
but
tell
you
what
it
is
lavender
if
i
knew
her
well
enough
go
straight
to
her
and
put
in
a
good
word
for
you
and
tell
her
some
things
she
know
and
see
if
she
write
you
a
letter
or
even
come
and
see
is
all
nonsense
johnny
though
its
very
good
of
you
to
think
of
it
the
mischief
i
have
done
to
be
put
aside
by
the
mere
writing
of
a
it
seems
to
me
johnny
said
with
some
warmth
you
are
as
unfair
to
her
as
to
yourself
in
not
giving
her
a
chance
you
know
how
willing
she
may
be
to
overlook
everything
that
is
she
were
i
am
not
fit
to
go
near
her
i
have
the
cheek
to
try
what
more
can
you
be
than
sorry
for
what
is
past
said
the
younger
fellow
persistently
you
know
how
pleased
it
makes
a
good
woman
to
give
her
the
chance
of
forgiving
anybody
and
if
we
were
all
to
set
up
for
being
archangels
and
if
there
was
to
be
no
sort
of
getting
back
for
us
after
we
had
made
a
slip
where
should
we
be
and
in
place
of
going
to
her
and
making
it
all
right
you
start
away
for
the
sound
of
islay
and
by
jove
you
find
out
what
spending
a
winter
under
these
jura
mountains
means
i
have
tried
it
and
i
a
flash
of
lightning
somewhere
down
among
the
arran
hills
interrupted
the
speaker
and
drew
the
attention
of
the
two
young
men
to
the
fact
that
in
the
east
and
southeast
the
stars
were
no
longer
visible
while
something
of
a
brisk
breeze
had
sprung
up
breeze
will
take
us
back
splendidly
johnny
said
getting
ready
again
for
the
run
to
tarbert
he
had
scarcely
spoken
when
lavender
called
attention
to
a
that
was
apparently
making
for
the
harbor
with
all
sails
set
she
was
sweeping
by
them
like
some
black
phantom
across
the
dark
plain
of
the
sea
they
could
not
make
out
the
figures
on
board
of
her
but
as
she
passed
some
one
called
out
to
them
did
he
say
lavender
asked
know
his
companion
said
it
was
some
sort
of
warning
i
suppose
by
jove
lavender
what
is
that
behind
them
there
was
a
strange
hissing
noise
that
the
wind
brought
along
to
them
but
nothing
could
be
seen
it
lavender
said
never
was
rain
like
that
his
companion
said
is
a
squall
and
it
will
be
here
presently
we
must
haul
down
the
sails
for
sake
look
sharp
lavender
there
was
certainly
no
time
to
lose
for
the
noise
behind
them
was
increasing
and
deepening
into
a
roar
and
the
heavens
had
grown
black
overhead
so
that
the
spars
and
ropes
of
the
crank
little
boat
could
scarcely
be
made
out
they
had
just
got
the
sails
down
when
the
first
gust
of
the
squall
struck
the
boat
as
with
a
blow
of
iron
and
sent
her
staggering
forward
into
the
trough
of
the
sea
then
all
around
them
came
the
fury
of
the
storm
and
the
cause
of
the
sound
they
heard
was
apparent
in
the
foaming
water
that
was
torn
and
scattered
abroad
by
the
gale
up
from
the
black
southeast
came
the
fierce
hurricane
sweeping
everything
before
it
and
hurling
this
creaking
and
straining
boat
about
as
if
it
were
a
cork
they
could
see
little
of
the
sea
around
them
but
they
could
hear
the
awful
noise
of
it
and
they
knew
they
were
being
swept
along
on
those
hurrying
waves
toward
a
coast
which
was
invisible
in
the
blackness
of
the
night
never
make
the
harbor
i
see
a
light
lavender
cried
we
better
try
to
keep
her
up
the
loch
make
the
harbor
his
companion
said
stand
this
much
blinding
torrents
of
rain
were
now
being
driven
down
by
the
force
of
the
wind
so
that
all
around
them
nothing
was
visible
but
a
wild
boiling
and
seething
of
clouds
and
waves
eyre
was
up
at
the
bow
trying
to
catch
some
glimpse
of
the
outlines
of
the
coast
or
to
make
out
some
light
that
would
show
them
where
the
entrance
to
tarbert
harbor
lay
if
only
some
lurid
shaft
of
lightning
would
pierce
the
gloom
for
they
knew
that
they
were
being
driven
headlong
on
an
coast
and
amid
all
the
noise
of
the
wind
and
the
sea
they
listened
with
a
fear
that
had
no
words
for
the
first
roar
of
the
waves
along
the
rocks
suddenly
lavender
heard
a
shrill
scream
almost
like
the
cry
a
hare
gives
when
it
finds
the
fangs
in
its
neck
and
at
the
same
moment
amid
all
the
darkness
of
the
night
a
still
blacker
object
seemed
to
start
out
of
the
gloom
right
ahead
of
them
the
boy
had
no
time
to
shout
any
warning
beyond
that
cry
of
despair
for
with
a
wild
crash
the
boat
struck
on
the
rocks
rose
and
struck
again
and
was
then
dashed
over
by
a
heavy
sea
both
of
its
occupants
being
thrown
into
the
fierce
swirls
of
foam
that
were
dashing
in
and
through
the
rocky
channels
strangely
enough
they
were
thrown
together
and
lavender
clinging
to
the
instinctively
laid
hold
of
his
companion
just
as
the
latter
appeared
to
be
slipping
into
the
gulf
beneath
he
cried
on
hold
on
to
me
or
we
shall
both
go
in
a
but
the
lad
had
no
life
left
in
him
and
lay
like
a
log
there
while
each
wave
that
struck
and
rolled
hissing
and
gurgling
through
the
channels
between
the
rocks
seemed
to
drag
at
him
and
seek
to
suck
him
down
into
the
darkness
with
one
despairing
effort
lavender
struggled
to
get
him
farther
up
on
the
slippery
and
succeeded
but
his
success
had
lost
him
his
own
vantage
ground
and
he
knew
that
he
was
going
down
into
the
whirling
waters
beneath
close
by
the
broken
boat
that
was
still
being
dashed
about
by
the
waves

fain
would
i
unexpected
circumstances
had
detained
kavanagh
and
her
daughter
in
london
long
after
everybody
else
had
left
but
at
length
they
were
ready
to
start
for
their
projected
trip
into
switzerland
on
the
day
before
their
departure
ingram
dined
with
them
on
his
own
invitation
he
had
got
into
the
habit
of
letting
them
know
when
it
would
suit
him
to
devote
an
evening
to
their
instruction
and
it
was
difficult
indeed
to
say
which
of
the
two
ladies
submitted
the
more
readily
and
meekly
to
the
dictatorial
enunciation
of
his
opinions
kavanagh
it
is
true
sometimes
dissented
in
so
far
as
a
smile
indicated
dissent
but
her
daughter
scarcely
reserved
to
herself
so
much
liberty
ingram
had
taken
her
in
hand
and
expected
of
her
the
obedience
and
respect
due
his
superior
age
and
yet
somehow
or
other
he
occasionally
found
himself
indirectly
soliciting
the
advice
of
this
gentle
and
young
person
more
especially
as
regarded
the
difficulties
surrounding
sheila
and
sometimes
a
chance
remark
of
hers
uttered
in
a
timid
or
careless
or
even
mocking
fashion
would
astonish
him
by
the
rapid
light
it
threw
on
these
dark
troubles
on
this
evening
the
last
evening
they
were
spending
in
london
it
was
his
own
affairs
which
he
proposed
to
mention
to
lorraine
and
he
had
no
more
hesitation
in
doing
so
than
if
she
had
been
his
oldest
friend
he
wanted
to
ask
her
what
he
should
do
about
the
money
mrs
lavender
had
left
him
and
he
intended
to
be
a
good
deal
more
frank
with
lorraine
than
with
any
of
the
others
to
whom
he
had
spoken
about
the
matter
for
he
was
well
aware
that
mrs
lavender
had
at
first
resolved
that
he
should
have
at
least
a
considerable
portion
of
her
wealth
or
why
should
she
have
asked
him
how
he
would
like
to
be
a
rich
man
do
not
think
said
lorraine
quietly
there
is
any
use
in
your
asking
me
what
you
should
do
for
i
know
what
you
will
do
whether
it
accords
with
any
opinion
or
no
and
yet
you
would
find
a
great
advantage
in
having
i
know
that
he
said
readily
should
like
to
be
rich
beyond
anything
that
ever
happened
in
a
drama
and
i
should
take
my
chance
of
all
the
evil
influences
that
money
is
supposed
to
exert
do
you
know
i
think
you
rich
people
are
very
unfairly
we
are
not
rich
said
kavanagh
passing
at
the
time
and
i
find
ourselves
very
poor
i
quite
agree
with
ingram
mamma
said
cecilia
as
if
any
one
had
had
the
courage
to
disagree
with
mr
ingram
people
are
shamefully
if
you
go
to
a
theatre
now
you
find
that
all
the
virtues
are
on
the
side
of
the
poor
and
if
there
are
a
few
vices
you
get
a
thousand
excuses
for
them
no
one
takes
account
of
the
temptations
of
the
rich
you
have
people
educated
from
their
infancy
to
imagine
that
the
whole
world
was
made
for
them
every
wish
they
have
gratified
every
day
showing
them
people
dependent
on
them
and
grateful
for
favors
and
no
allowance
is
made
for
such
a
temptation
to
become
haughty
and
overbearing
but
of
course
it
stands
to
reason
that
the
rich
never
have
justice
done
them
in
plays
and
stories
for
the
people
who
write
are
all
of
enough
to
strike
an
average
of
injustice
and
it
is
very
hard
for
it
is
the
rich
who
buy
books
and
who
take
boxes
at
the
theaters
and
then
they
find
themselves
grossly
abused
whereas
the
humble
peasant
who
can
scarcely
read
at
all
and
who
never
pays
more
than
sixpence
for
a
seat
in
the
gallery
is
flattered
and
coaxed
and
caressed
until
one
wonders
whether
the
source
of
virtue
is
the
drinking
of
sour
ale
ingram
you
do
it
yourself
you
impress
mamma
and
me
with
the
belief
that
we
are
miserable
sinners
if
we
are
not
continually
doing
some
act
of
charity
well
that
is
all
very
pleasant
and
necessary
in
moderation
but
you
find
the
poor
folks
so
very
anxious
to
live
for
other
people
they
care
much
what
becomes
of
us
they
take
your
port
wine
and
flannels
as
if
they
were
conferring
a
favor
on
you
but
as
for
condition
and
prospect
in
this
world
and
the
next
they
trouble
much
about
that
now
mamma
just
wait
a
will
not
you
are
a
bad
girl
said
kavanagh
severely
has
ingram
been
teaching
you
and
making
you
better
for
ever
so
long
back
and
you
pretend
to
accept
his
counsel
and
reform
yourself
and
then
all
at
once
you
break
out
and
throw
down
the
tablets
of
the
law
and
conduct
yourself
like
a
i
want
him
to
explain
mamma
i
suppose
he
considers
it
wicked
for
us
to
start
for
switzerland
the
money
we
shall
expend
in
traveling
might
have
dispatched
a
cargo
of
muskets
to
some
missionary
station
so
that
no
ingram
said
carelessly
and
nursing
his
knee
with
both
his
hands
as
usual
is
not
wicked
it
is
only
unreasonable
a
traveler
you
know
is
a
person
who
has
a
house
in
one
town
and
who
goes
to
live
in
a
house
in
another
town
in
order
to
have
the
pleasure
of
paying
for
ingram
said
kavanagh
you
talk
seriously
for
one
minute
and
tell
me
whether
we
are
to
expect
to
see
you
in
the
tyrol
but
ingram
was
not
in
a
mood
for
talking
seriously
and
he
waited
to
hear
lorraine
strike
in
with
some
calmly
audacious
invitation
she
did
not
however
and
he
turned
around
from
her
mother
to
question
her
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ground
and
that
something
like
a
tinge
of
color
was
in
her
face
he
turned
rapidly
away
again
kavanagh
he
said
with
a
fine
air
of
indifference
last
time
we
spoke
about
that
i
was
not
in
the
difficulty
i
am
in
at
present
how
could
i
go
traveling
just
now
without
knowing
how
to
regulate
my
daily
expenses
am
i
to
travel
with
six
white
horses
and
silver
bells
or
trudge
on
foot
with
a
wallet
know
quite
well
said
lorraine
warmly
know
you
will
not
touch
that
money
that
mrs
lavender
has
left
pardon
me
he
said
should
rejoice
to
have
it
if
it
did
not
properly
belong
to
some
one
else
and
the
difficulty
is
that
mackenzie
is
obviously
very
anxious
that
neither
mr
lavender
nor
sheila
should
have
it
if
sheila
gets
it
of
course
she
will
give
it
to
her
husband
now
if
it
is
not
to
be
given
to
her
do
you
think
i
should
regard
the
money
with
any
particular
horror
and
refuse
to
touch
it
that
would
be
very
romantic
perhaps
but
i
should
be
sorry
you
know
to
give
my
friends
the
most
disquieting
doubts
about
my
sanity
romance
goes
out
of
a
head
when
the
hair
gets
a
man
has
gray
hair
lorraine
said
still
with
some
unnecessary
fervor
does
not
know
that
there
are
things
much
more
valuable
than
money
you
touch
that
money
just
now
and
all
the
thinking
and
reasoning
in
the
world
will
never
get
you
to
touch
am
i
to
do
with
it
he
said
meekly
it
to
mackenzie
in
trust
for
his
daughter
lorraine
said
promptly
and
then
seeing
that
her
mother
had
gone
to
the
end
of
the
to
fetch
something
or
other
she
added
quickly
should
be
more
sorry
than
i
can
tell
you
to
find
you
accepting
this
money
you
do
not
wish
to
have
it
you
do
not
need
it
and
if
you
did
take
it
it
would
prove
a
source
of
continual
embarrassment
and
regret
to
you
and
no
assurances
on
the
part
of
mackenzie
would
be
able
to
convince
you
that
you
had
acted
rightly
by
his
daughter
now
if
you
simply
hand
over
your
responsibilities
to
him
he
can
not
refuse
them
for
the
sake
of
his
own
child
and
you
are
left
with
the
sense
of
having
acted
nobly
and
generously
i
hope
there
are
many
men
who
would
do
what
i
ask
you
to
do
but
i
have
not
met
many
to
whom
i
could
make
such
an
appeal
with
any
hope
but
after
all
that
is
only
advice
i
have
no
right
to
ask
you
to
do
anything
like
that
you
asked
me
for
my
opinion
about
it
well
that
is
it
but
i
should
not
have
asked
you
to
act
on
i
will
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
then
he
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
for
kavanagh
was
calling
him
to
help
her
in
finding
something
she
had
lost
before
he
had
left
that
evening
lorraine
said
to
him
go
by
the
night
mail
to
paris
night
and
we
shall
dine
here
at
five
would
you
have
the
courage
to
come
up
and
join
us
in
that
melancholy
ceremony
yes
he
said
i
may
go
down
to
the
station
to
see
you
away
think
if
we
got
you
so
far
we
should
persuade
you
to
go
with
us
kavanagh
said
with
a
smile
he
sat
silent
for
a
minute
of
course
she
could
not
seriously
mean
such
a
thing
but
at
all
events
she
would
not
be
displeased
if
he
crossed
their
path
while
they
were
actually
abroad
is
getting
too
late
in
the
year
to
go
to
scotland
now
he
said
with
some
hesitation
most
certainly
lorraine
said
know
where
the
man
in
whose
yacht
i
was
to
have
gone
may
be
now
i
might
spend
half
my
holiday
in
trying
to
catch
during
that
time
you
would
be
alone
lorraine
said
suppose
the
tyrol
is
a
very
nice
place
he
suggested
most
delightful
she
exclaimed
know
we
should
go
around
by
switzerland
and
go
up
by
luzerne
and
zurich
to
the
end
of
the
lake
of
constance
bregenz
mamma
that
the
place
where
we
hired
that
man
the
year
before
last
you
see
ingram
if
you
had
less
time
than
we
if
you
could
not
start
with
us
you
might
come
straight
down
by
schaffhausen
and
the
steamer
and
catch
us
up
there
and
then
mamma
would
become
your
guide
i
am
sure
we
should
have
some
pleasant
days
together
till
you
got
tired
of
us
and
then
you
could
go
off
on
a
walking
tour
if
you
pleased
and
then
you
know
there
would
be
no
difficulty
about
our
meeting
at
bregenz
for
mamma
and
i
have
plenty
of
time
and
we
should
wait
there
for
a
few
days
so
as
to
make
said
kavanagh
must
not
persuade
ingram
against
his
will
he
may
have
other
duties
other
friends
to
see
proposed
it
mamma
said
the
daughter
calmly
did
as
a
mere
joke
but
of
course
if
ingram
thinks
of
going
to
the
tyrol
we
should
be
most
pleased
to
see
him
i
have
no
other
friends
whom
i
am
bound
to
see
ingram
said
with
some
hesitation
i
should
like
to
go
to
the
tyrol
but
the
fact
is
i
am
afraid
i
interrupt
you
said
lorraine
do
not
like
to
leave
london
so
long
as
your
friend
sheila
is
in
trouble
is
not
that
the
case
and
yet
she
has
her
father
to
look
after
her
and
it
is
clear
you
can
not
do
much
for
her
when
you
do
not
even
know
where
mr
lavender
is
on
the
whole
i
think
you
should
consider
yourself
a
little
bit
now
and
not
get
cheated
out
of
your
holidays
for
the
well
ingram
said
shall
be
able
to
tell
you
to
be
so
phlegmatic
and
a
person
ingram
was
sorely
disturbed
on
going
home
that
evening
nor
did
he
sleep
much
during
the
night
for
the
more
that
he
speculated
on
all
the
possibilities
that
might
arise
from
his
meeting
these
people
in
the
tyrol
the
more
pertinaciously
did
this
refrain
follow
these
excursive
fancies
i
go
to
the
tyrol
i
shall
fall
in
love
with
that
girl
and
ask
her
to
marry
me
and
if
i
do
so
what
position
should
i
hold
with
regard
to
her
as
a
penniless
man
with
a
rich
wife
he
did
not
look
at
the
question
in
such
a
light
as
the
opinion
of
the
world
might
throw
on
it
the
difficulty
was
that
she
herself
might
afterwards
come
to
think
of
their
mutual
relations
true
it
was
that
no
one
could
be
more
gentle
and
submissive
to
him
than
she
appeared
to
be
in
matters
of
opinion
and
discussion
he
already
ruled
with
an
autocratic
authority
which
he
fully
perceived
himself
and
exercised
too
with
some
sort
of
notion
that
it
was
good
for
this
young
woman
to
have
to
submit
to
control
but
of
what
avail
would
this
moral
authority
be
as
against
the
consciousness
she
would
have
that
it
was
her
fortune
that
was
supplying
both
with
the
means
of
living
he
went
down
to
his
office
in
the
morning
with
no
plans
formed
the
forenoon
passed
and
he
had
decided
on
nothing
at
he
suddenly
bethought
him
that
it
would
be
very
pleasant
if
sheila
would
go
and
see
lorraine
and
forthwith
he
did
that
which
would
have
driven
frank
lavender
out
of
his
senses
he
telegraphed
to
lorraine
to
bring
sheila
and
her
father
to
dinner
at
five
he
certainly
knew
that
such
a
request
was
a
trifle
cool
but
he
had
discovered
that
lorraine
was
not
easily
shocked
by
such
audacious
experiments
on
her
good
nature
when
he
received
the
telegram
in
reply
he
knew
it
granted
what
he
had
asked
the
words
were
merely
by
all
means
but
not
later
than
then
he
hastened
down
to
the
house
in
which
sheila
lived
and
found
that
she
and
her
father
had
just
returned
from
visiting
some
exhibition
mackenzie
was
not
in
the
room
ingram
said
would
you
think
of
my
getting
married
sheila
looked
up
with
a
bright
smile
and
said
would
please
me
very
much
it
would
be
a
great
pleasure
to
me
and
i
have
expected
it
for
some
have
expected
it
he
repeated
with
a
stare
she
said
quietly
you
fancy
you
know
he
said
or
rather
stammered
in
great
embarrassment
when
she
interrupted
him
by
saying
yes
i
think
i
know
when
you
came
down
every
evening
to
tell
me
all
the
praises
of
lorraine
and
how
clever
she
was
and
kind
i
expected
you
would
come
some
day
with
another
message
and
now
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
you
have
changed
all
my
opinions
about
her
and
then
she
rose
and
took
both
his
hands
and
looked
frankly
into
his
face
i
do
hope
most
sincerely
you
will
be
happy
my
dear
ingram
was
fairly
taken
aback
at
the
consequences
of
his
own
imprudence
he
had
never
dreamed
for
a
moment
that
any
one
would
have
suspected
such
a
thing
and
he
had
thrown
out
the
suggestion
to
sheila
almost
as
a
jest
believing
of
course
that
it
compromised
no
one
and
here
before
he
had
spoken
a
word
to
lorraine
on
the
subject
he
was
being
congratulated
on
his
approaching
marriage
sheila
he
said
is
all
a
mistake
it
was
a
joke
of
mine
if
i
had
known
you
would
think
of
lorraine
i
would
not
have
said
a
word
about
it
is
lorraine
sheila
said
but
i
have
never
mentioned
such
a
thing
to
her
never
hinted
it
in
the
remotest
manner
i
dare
say
if
i
had
she
might
laugh
the
matter
aside
as
too
will
not
do
that
sheila
said
you
ask
her
to
marry
you
she
will
marry
you
i
am
sure
of
that
from
what
i
have
heard
and
she
would
be
very
foolish
if
she
was
not
proud
and
glad
to
do
that
and
you
what
doubt
can
you
have
after
all
that
you
have
been
saying
of
late
you
marry
a
woman
merely
because
you
admire
her
cleverness
and
kindness
he
said
and
then
he
added
suddenly
would
you
do
me
a
great
favor
lorraine
and
her
mother
are
leaving
for
the
continent
they
dine
at
five
and
i
am
commissioned
to
ask
you
and
your
papa
if
you
would
go
up
with
me
and
have
some
dinner
with
them
you
know
before
they
start
you
do
that
sheila
the
girl
shook
her
head
without
answering
she
had
not
gone
to
any
house
since
her
husband
had
left
london
and
that
house
above
all
others
was
calculated
to
awaken
in
her
bitter
recollections
you
sheila
he
said
used
to
go
there
i
know
they
like
you
very
much
i
have
seen
you
very
well
pleased
and
comfortable
there
and
i
thought
you
were
enjoying
that
is
true
said
sheila
and
then
she
looked
up
with
a
strange
sort
of
smile
on
her
lips
made
the
assembly
shine
that
forced
smile
did
not
last
long
the
girl
suddenly
burst
into
tears
and
rose
and
went
away
to
the
window
mackenzie
came
into
the
room
he
did
not
see
his
daughter
was
crying
ingram
and
are
you
coming
with
us
to
the
lewis
we
can
not
be
staying
in
london
for
there
will
be
many
things
wanting
the
looking
after
in
borva
as
you
will
know
ferry
well
and
yet
sheila
she
will
not
go
back
and
mairi
too
she
will
be
forgetting
the
ferry
sight
of
her
own
people
but
if
you
wass
coming
with
us
ingram
sheila
she
would
come
too
and
it
would
be
ferry
good
for
her
have
brought
you
another
proposal
will
you
take
sheila
to
see
the
tyrol
and
i
will
go
with
you
tyrol
said
mackenzie
it
is
a
ferry
long
way
away
but
if
sheila
will
care
to
go
to
the
tyrol
oh
yes
i
will
go
to
the
tyrol
or
anywhere
if
she
will
go
out
of
london
for
it
is
not
good
for
a
young
girl
to
be
always
in
the
one
house
and
no
company
and
no
variety
and
i
was
saying
to
sheila
what
good
will
she
do
sitting
by
the
window
and
thinking
over
things
and
crying
sometimes
by
kott
it
is
a
foolish
thing
for
a
young
girl
and
i
will
hef
no
more
of
it
in
other
circumstances
ingram
would
have
laughed
at
this
dreadful
threat
despite
the
frown
on
the
old
face
the
sudden
stamp
of
his
foot
and
the
vehemence
of
his
words
ingram
knew
that
if
sheila
had
turned
around
and
said
that
she
wished
to
be
shut
up
in
a
dark
room
for
the
rest
of
her
life
the
old
king
of
borva
would
have
said
well
sheila
in
the
meekest
way
and
would
have
been
satisfied
if
only
he
could
share
her
imprisonment
with
her
first
of
all
mackenzie
i
have
another
proposal
to
make
to
you
ingram
said
and
then
he
urged
upon
father
to
accept
invitation
mackenzie
was
nothing
loth
sheila
was
living
by
far
too
monotonous
a
life
he
went
over
to
the
window
to
her
and
said
my
lass
you
was
going
nowhere
else
this
evening
and
it
would
be
ferry
convenient
to
go
with
ingram
and
he
would
see
his
friends
away
and
we
could
go
to
a
theatre
then
and
it
is
no
new
thing
for
you
to
go
to
fine
houses
and
see
other
people
but
it
is
new
to
me
and
you
wass
saying
what
a
beautiful
house
it
wass
many
a
time
and
i
hef
wished
to
see
it
and
the
people
are
ferry
kind
sheila
to
send
me
an
invitation
and
if
they
wass
to
come
to
the
lewis
what
would
you
think
if
you
asked
them
to
come
to
your
house
and
they
paid
no
heed
to
it
now
it
is
after
four
sheila
and
if
you
wass
to
get
ready
now
i
will
go
and
get
ready
papa
she
said
ingram
had
a
vague
consciousness
that
he
was
taking
sheila
up
to
introduce
to
her
lorraine
in
a
new
character
would
sheila
look
at
the
woman
she
used
to
fear
and
dislike
in
a
wholly
different
fashion
and
be
prepared
to
adorn
her
with
all
the
graces
which
he
had
so
often
described
to
her
ingram
hoped
that
sheila
would
get
to
like
lorraine
and
that
a
better
acquaintance
between
them
might
lead
to
a
warm
and
friendly
intimacy
somehow
he
felt
that
if
sheila
would
betray
such
a
liking
if
she
would
come
to
him
and
say
honestly
that
she
was
rejoiced
he
meant
to
marry
all
his
doubts
would
be
cleared
away
sheila
had
already
said
pretty
nearly
as
much
as
that
but
then
it
followed
what
she
understood
to
be
an
announcement
of
his
approaching
marriage
and
of
course
the
kindly
nature
at
once
suggested
a
few
pretty
speeches
sheila
now
knew
that
nothing
was
settled
after
looking
at
lorraine
in
the
light
of
these
new
possibilities
would
she
come
to
him
and
counsel
him
to
go
on
and
challenge
a
decision
mackenzie
received
with
a
grave
dignity
and
politeness
the
more
than
friendly
welcome
given
him
by
both
kavanagh
and
her
daughter
and
in
view
of
their
approaching
tour
he
gave
them
to
understand
that
he
had
himself
established
somewhat
familiar
relations
with
foreign
countries
by
reason
of
his
meeting
with
the
ships
and
sailors
hailing
from
those
distant
shores
he
displayed
a
profound
knowledge
of
the
habits
and
customs
and
of
the
natural
products
of
many
remote
lands
which
were
much
farther
afield
than
a
little
bit
of
inland
germany
he
represented
the
island
of
borva
indeed
as
a
sort
of
lighthouse
from
which
you
could
survey
pretty
nearly
all
the
countries
of
the
world
and
broadly
hinted
that
so
far
as
insular
prejudice
being
the
fruit
of
living
in
such
a
place
a
general
intercourse
with
diverse
peoples
tended
to
widen
the
understanding
and
throw
light
on
the
various
social
experiments
that
had
been
made
by
the
lawgivers
the
philanthropists
the
philosophers
of
the
world
it
seemed
to
sheila
as
she
sat
and
listened
that
the
pale
calm
and
young
lady
opposite
her
was
not
quite
so
as
usual
she
seemed
shy
and
a
little
did
she
suspect
that
she
was
being
observed
sheila
wondered
and
the
reason
when
dinner
was
announced
she
took
arm
and
allowed
ingram
to
follow
them
protesting
into
the
other
room
but
there
was
much
more
of
embarrassment
and
timidity
than
of
an
audacious
mischief
in
her
look
she
was
very
kind
indeed
to
sheila
but
she
had
wholly
abandoned
that
air
of
maternal
patronage
which
she
used
to
assume
toward
the
girl
she
seemed
to
wish
to
be
more
friendly
and
confidential
with
her
and
indeed
scarcely
spoke
a
word
to
ingram
during
dinner
so
persistently
did
she
talk
to
sheila
who
sat
next
her
ingram
got
vexed
lorraine
he
said
seem
to
forget
that
this
is
a
solemn
occasion
you
ask
us
to
a
farewell
banquet
but
instead
of
observing
the
proper
ceremonies
you
pass
the
time
in
talking
about
fancy
work
and
music
and
other
ordinary
everyday
are
the
ceremonies
she
said
he
answered
need
not
occupy
the
time
with
crochet
lavender
and
i
are
very
well
pleased
to
talk
about
i
am
not
he
said
bluntly
i
am
not
going
to
be
shut
out
by
a
conspiracy
come
let
us
talk
about
your
my
lord
give
his
commands
as
to
the
point
at
which
we
shall
start
the
conversation
may
skip
the
wish
i
could
she
remarked
with
a
sigh
shall
land
you
in
paris
how
are
we
to
know
that
you
have
arrived
safely
she
looked
embarrassed
for
a
moment
and
then
said
it
is
of
any
consequence
for
you
to
know
i
shall
be
writing
in
any
case
to
mrs
lavender
about
some
little
private
ingram
did
not
receive
this
promise
with
any
great
show
of
delight
see
he
said
somewhat
glumly
i
am
to
meet
you
anywhere
i
should
like
to
know
the
various
stages
of
your
route
so
that
i
could
guard
against
our
missing
each
have
decided
to
go
then
ingram
not
looking
at
her
but
looking
at
sheila
said
and
sheila
despite
all
her
efforts
could
not
help
glancing
up
with
a
brief
smile
and
blush
of
pleasure
that
were
quite
visible
to
everybody
lorraine
struck
in
with
a
sort
of
nervous
haste
that
will
be
very
pleasant
for
mamma
for
she
gets
rather
tired
of
me
at
times
when
we
are
traveling
two
women
who
always
read
the
same
sort
of
books
and
have
the
same
opinions
about
the
people
they
meet
and
have
precisely
the
same
tastes
in
everything
are
not
very
amusing
companions
for
each
other
you
want
a
little
discussion
thrown
if
we
meet
ingram
we
are
sure
to
have
that
kavanagh
said
benignly
you
want
somebody
to
give
you
new
opinions
and
put
things
differently
you
know
i
am
sure
mamma
will
be
most
kind
to
you
if
you
can
make
it
convenient
to
spend
a
few
days
with
us
that
will
be
delightful
lorraine
cried
suddenly
taking
hand
will
come
you
we
should
have
such
a
pleasant
party
i
am
sure
your
papa
will
be
most
interested
and
we
are
not
tied
to
any
route
we
should
go
wherever
you
she
would
have
gone
on
beseeching
and
advising
but
she
saw
something
in
face
which
told
her
that
all
her
efforts
would
be
unavailing
is
very
kind
of
you
sheila
said
i
do
not
think
i
can
go
to
the
you
shall
go
back
to
the
lewis
sheila
her
father
said
can
not
go
back
to
the
lewis
papa
she
said
simply
and
at
this
point
ingram
perceiving
how
painful
the
discussion
was
for
the
girl
suddenly
called
attention
to
the
hour
and
asked
kavanagh
if
all
her
portmanteaus
were
strapped
up
they
drove
in
a
body
down
to
the
station
and
ingram
was
most
assiduous
in
supplying
the
two
travelers
with
an
abundance
of
everything
they
could
not
possibly
want
he
got
them
a
though
both
of
them
declared
they
never
read
in
a
train
he
got
them
some
though
they
had
plenty
in
their
he
purchased
for
them
an
amount
of
miscellaneous
literature
that
would
have
been
of
benefit
to
a
hospital
provided
the
patients
were
strong
enough
to
bear
it
and
then
he
bade
them
at
least
half
a
dozen
times
as
the
train
was
slowly
moving
out
of
the
station
and
made
the
most
solemn
vows
about
meeting
them
at
bregenz
sheila
he
said
we
go
the
theatre
do
not
care
to
go
unless
you
wish
was
the
answer
does
not
care
to
go
anywhere
now
her
father
said
and
then
the
girl
seeing
that
he
was
rather
distressed
about
her
apparent
want
of
interest
pulled
herself
together
and
said
cheerfully
it
not
too
late
to
go
to
a
theatre
and
i
am
sure
we
could
be
very
comfortable
at
home
mairi
she
will
think
it
unkind
if
we
go
to
the
theatre
by
said
her
father
impatiently
for
he
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
indirectly
justifying
lavender
has
more
sense
than
you
sheila
and
she
knows
that
a
has
to
stay
at
home
and
she
knows
that
she
is
ferry
different
from
you
and
she
is
a
ferry
good
girl
whatever
and
hass
no
pride
and
she
does
not
expect
nonsense
in
going
about
and
such
am
quite
sure
papa
you
would
rather
go
home
and
sit
down
and
have
a
talk
with
ingram
and
a
pipe
and
a
little
whisky
than
go
to
any
i
would
do
and
what
i
would
like
said
her
father
in
a
vexed
way
you
have
no
more
sense
as
a
lass
that
wass
still
at
the
school
i
want
you
to
go
to
the
theatre
and
amuse
youself
instead
of
sitting
in
the
house
and
thinking
thinking
thinking
and
all
for
what
if
one
has
something
to
be
sorry
for
is
it
not
better
to
think
of
it
what
hef
you
to
be
sorry
for
said
her
father
in
amazement
and
forgetting
that
in
his
diplomatic
fashion
he
had
been
accustoming
sheila
to
the
notion
that
she
too
might
have
erred
grievously
and
been
in
part
responsible
for
all
that
had
occurred
have
a
great
deal
to
be
sorry
for
papa
she
said
and
then
she
renewed
her
entreaties
that
her
two
companions
should
abandon
their
notion
of
going
to
a
theatre
and
resolve
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
evening
in
what
she
consented
to
call
her
home
after
all
they
formed
a
comfortable
little
company
when
they
sat
around
the
fire
which
had
been
lit
for
cheerfulness
rather
than
warmth
and
ingram
at
least
was
in
a
particularly
pleasant
mood
for
sheila
had
seized
the
opportunity
when
her
father
had
gone
out
of
the
room
for
a
few
minutes
to
say
suddenly
my
dear
friend
if
you
care
for
her
you
have
a
great
happiness
before
sheila
he
said
staring
cares
for
you
more
than
you
can
think
i
saw
it
in
everything
she
said
and
thought
she
was
just
a
trifle
saucy
do
you
know
she
shunted
me
out
of
the
conversation
sheila
shook
her
head
and
smiled
was
embarrassed
she
suspects
that
you
like
her
and
that
i
know
it
and
that
i
came
to
see
her
if
you
ask
her
to
marry
you
she
will
do
it
ingram
said
with
a
severity
that
was
not
in
his
heart
must
not
say
such
things
you
might
make
fearful
mischief
by
putting
these
wild
notions
into
are
not
wild
notions
she
said
quietly
woman
can
tell
what
another
woman
is
thinking
about
better
than
a
am
i
to
go
to
the
tyrol
and
ask
her
to
marry
me
he
said
with
the
air
of
a
meek
scholar
should
like
to
see
you
married
very
very
much
indeed
sheila
said
to
her
to
her
the
girl
said
frankly
i
am
sure
she
has
great
regard
for
you
and
she
is
clever
enough
to
put
value
on
on
but
i
can
not
flatter
you
i
send
you
word
about
what
happens
in
the
tyrol
he
said
still
with
the
humble
air
of
one
receiving
instructions
if
she
rejects
me
what
shall
i
do
will
not
reject
i
come
to
you
for
consolation
and
ask
you
what
you
meant
by
driving
me
on
such
a
blunder
she
rejects
sheila
said
with
a
smile
will
be
your
own
fault
and
you
will
deserve
it
for
you
are
a
little
too
harsh
with
her
and
you
have
too
much
authority
and
i
am
surprised
that
she
will
be
so
amiable
under
it
because
you
know
a
woman
expects
to
be
treated
with
much
gentleness
and
deference
before
she
has
said
she
will
marry
she
likes
to
be
entreated
and
coaxed
and
made
much
of
but
instead
of
that
you
are
very
overbearing
with
did
not
mean
to
be
sheila
he
said
honestly
enough
anything
of
the
kind
happened
it
must
have
been
in
a
no
not
a
joke
sheila
said
i
have
noticed
it
before
the
very
first
evening
you
came
to
their
house
and
perhaps
you
did
not
know
of
it
yourself
and
then
lorraine
she
is
clever
enough
to
see
that
you
did
not
mean
to
be
disrespectful
but
she
will
expect
you
to
alter
that
a
great
deal
if
you
ask
her
to
marry
you
that
is
until
you
are
i
ever
been
overbearing
to
you
sheila
he
asked
me
oh
no
you
have
always
been
very
gentle
to
me
but
i
know
how
that
is
when
you
first
knew
me
i
was
almost
a
child
and
you
treated
me
like
a
child
and
ever
since
then
it
has
always
been
the
same
but
to
others
yes
you
are
too
unceremonious
and
lorraine
will
expect
you
to
be
much
more
mild
and
amiable
and
you
must
let
her
have
opinions
of
her
you
give
me
to
understand
that
i
am
a
bear
he
said
in
tones
of
injured
protest
sheila
laughed
i
told
you
the
truth
at
last
it
was
no
matter
so
long
as
you
had
ordinary
acquaintances
to
deal
with
but
now
if
you
wish
to
marry
that
pretty
lady
you
must
be
much
more
gentle
if
you
are
discussing
anything
with
her
and
if
she
says
anything
that
is
not
very
wise
you
must
not
say
bluntly
that
it
is
foolish
but
you
must
smooth
it
away
and
put
her
right
gently
and
then
she
will
be
grateful
to
you
but
if
you
say
to
her
that
is
nonsense
as
you
might
say
to
a
man
you
will
hurt
her
very
much
the
man
would
not
care
he
would
think
you
were
stupid
to
have
a
different
opinion
from
him
but
a
woman
fears
she
is
not
as
clever
as
the
man
she
is
talking
to
and
likes
his
good
opinion
and
if
she
says
something
careless
like
that
she
is
sensitive
to
it
and
it
wounds
her
you
contradicted
lorraine
about
the
h
in
those
italian
words
and
i
am
quite
sure
you
were
wrong
she
knows
italian
much
better
than
you
do
and
yet
she
yielded
to
you
very
on
sheila
go
on
he
said
with
a
resigned
air
else
did
i
do
a
great
many
rude
things
you
should
not
have
contradicted
kavanagh
about
the
color
of
an
why
you
know
she
was
wrong
and
she
said
herself
a
minute
afterwards
that
she
was
thinking
of
a
you
ought
not
to
contradict
a
person
older
than
yourself
said
sheila
sententiously
gracious
me
because
one
person
is
born
in
one
year
and
one
in
another
is
that
any
reason
why
you
should
say
that
an
amethyst
is
blue
mackenzie
come
and
talk
to
this
girl
she
is
trying
to
pervert
my
principles
she
says
that
in
talking
to
a
woman
you
have
to
abandon
all
hope
of
being
accurate
and
that
respect
for
the
truth
is
not
to
be
thought
of
because
a
woman
has
a
pretty
face
she
is
to
be
allowed
to
say
that
black
is
white
and
white
and
if
you
say
anything
to
the
contrary
you
are
a
brute
and
had
better
go
and
bellow
by
yourself
in
a
is
quite
right
said
old
mackenzie
at
a
venture
do
you
think
so
ingram
asked
coolly
i
can
understand
how
her
moral
sentiment
has
been
destroyed
and
it
is
easy
to
see
where
she
has
got
a
set
of
opinions
that
strike
at
the
very
roots
of
a
respectable
and
decent
you
know
said
sheila
seriously
it
is
very
rude
of
you
to
say
so
even
in
jest
if
you
treat
lorraine
in
this
way
she
suddenly
stopped
her
father
had
not
heard
being
busy
among
his
pipes
so
the
subject
was
discreetly
dropped
ingram
reluctantly
promising
to
pay
some
attention
to
precepts
of
politeness
altogether
it
was
a
pleasant
evening
they
had
but
when
ingram
had
left
mackenzie
said
to
his
daughter
look
at
this
sheila
when
ingram
goes
away
from
london
you
hef
no
friend
at
all
then
in
the
place
and
you
are
quite
alone
why
will
you
not
come
to
the
lewis
sheila
it
is
no
one
there
will
know
anything
of
what
has
happened
here
and
mairi
she
is
a
good
girl
and
she
will
hold
her
will
ask
me
why
i
come
back
without
my
husband
sheila
said
looking
down
you
will
leave
that
all
to
me
said
her
father
who
knew
he
had
surely
sufficient
skill
to
thwart
the
curiosity
of
a
few
simple
creatures
in
borva
is
many
a
girl
hass
to
go
home
for
a
time
while
her
husband
he
is
away
on
his
business
and
there
will
no
one
hef
the
right
to
ask
you
any
more
than
i
will
tell
them
and
i
will
tell
them
what
they
should
know
oh
yes
i
will
tell
them
ferry
well
and
you
will
hef
no
trouble
about
it
and
sheila
you
are
a
good
lass
and
you
know
that
i
hef
many
things
to
attend
to
that
is
not
easy
to
write
about
do
know
that
papa
the
girl
said
many
a
time
have
i
wished
you
would
go
back
to
the
leave
you
here
by
yourself
why
you
are
talking
foolishly
sheila
but
now
sheila
you
will
see
how
you
could
go
back
with
me
and
it
would
be
a
ferry
different
thing
for
you
running
about
in
the
fresh
air
than
shut
up
in
a
room
in
the
middle
of
a
town
and
you
are
not
looking
ferry
well
my
lass
and
scarlett
she
will
hef
to
take
the
charge
of
will
go
to
the
lewis
with
you
papa
when
you
please
she
said
and
he
was
glad
and
proud
to
hear
her
decision
but
there
was
no
happy
light
of
anticipation
in
her
eyes
such
as
ought
to
have
been
awakened
by
this
projected
journey
to
the
far
island
which
she
had
known
as
her
home
and
so
it
was
that
one
rough
and
blustering
afternoon
the
clansman
steamed
into
stornoway
harbor
and
sheila
casting
timid
and
furtive
glances
toward
the
quay
saw
duncan
standing
there
with
the
wagonette
some
little
distance
back
under
charge
of
a
boy
duncan
was
a
proud
man
that
day
he
was
the
first
to
shove
the
gangway
on
to
the
vessel
and
he
was
the
first
to
get
on
board
and
in
another
minute
sheila
found
the
tall
keeper
before
her
and
he
was
talking
in
a
rapid
and
eager
fashion
throwing
in
an
occasional
scrap
of
gaelic
in
the
mere
hurry
of
his
words
yes
miss
sheila
scarlett
she
is
ferry
well
whatever
but
there
is
nothing
will
make
her
so
well
as
your
coming
back
to
sa
lewis
and
we
wass
saying
yesterday
that
it
looked
as
if
it
wass
more
as
three
or
four
years
or
six
years
since
you
went
away
from
sa
lewis
but
now
it
iss
no
time
at
all
for
you
are
just
the
same
miss
sheila
as
we
knew
before
and
there
is
not
one
in
all
borva
but
will
think
it
iss
a
good
day
this
day
that
you
will
come
said
mackenzie
with
an
impatient
stamp
of
his
foot
will
you
talk
like
a
foolish
man
get
the
luggage
to
the
shore
instead
of
keeping
us
all
the
day
in
the
ferry
well
mackenzie
said
duncan
departing
with
an
injured
air
and
grumbling
as
he
went
iss
no
new
thing
to
you
to
see
miss
sheila
and
you
will
have
no
thocht
for
any
one
but
yourself
but
i
will
get
out
the
luggage
oh
yes
i
will
get
out
the
sheila
in
truth
had
but
little
luggage
with
her
but
she
remained
on
board
the
boat
until
duncan
was
quite
ready
to
start
for
she
did
not
wish
just
then
to
meet
any
of
her
friends
in
stornoway
then
she
stepped
ashore
and
crossed
the
quay
and
got
into
the
wagonette
and
the
two
horses
whom
she
had
caressed
for
a
moment
seemed
to
know
that
they
were
carrying
sheila
back
to
her
own
country
from
the
speed
with
which
they
rattled
out
of
the
town
and
away
into
the
lonely
moorland
mackenzie
let
them
have
their
way
past
the
solitary
lakes
they
went
past
the
long
stretches
of
undulating
morass
past
the
lonely
sheilings
perched
far
upon
the
hills
and
the
rough
and
blustering
wind
blew
about
them
and
the
gray
clouds
hurried
by
and
the
old
man
who
shook
the
reins
and
gave
the
horses
their
heads
could
have
laughed
aloud
in
his
joy
that
he
was
driving
his
daughter
home
but
sheila
she
sat
there
as
one
dead
and
mairi
timidly
regarding
her
wondered
what
the
impassable
face
and
the
bewildered
sad
eyes
meant
did
she
not
smell
the
sweet
strong
smell
of
the
heather
had
she
no
interest
in
the
great
birds
that
were
circling
in
the
air
over
by
the
barbhas
mountains
where
was
the
pleasure
she
used
to
exhibit
in
remembering
the
curious
names
of
the
small
lakes
they
passed
and
lo
the
rough
gray
day
broke
asunder
and
a
great
blaze
of
fire
appeared
in
the
west
shining
across
the
moors
and
touching
the
blue
slopes
of
the
distant
hills
sheila
was
getting
near
the
region
of
beautiful
sunsets
and
lambent
twilights
and
the
constant
movement
and
mystery
of
the
sea
overhead
the
heavy
clouds
were
still
hurried
on
by
the
wind
and
in
the
south
the
eastern
slopes
of
the
hills
and
the
moors
were
getting
to
be
of
a
soft
purple
but
all
along
the
west
where
her
home
was
lay
a
great
flush
of
gold
and
she
knew
that
loch
roag
was
shining
there
and
the
gable
of
the
house
at
borvapost
getting
warm
in
the
beautiful
light
is
a
good
afternoon
you
will
be
getting
to
see
borva
her
father
said
to
her
but
all
the
answer
she
made
was
to
ask
her
father
not
to
stop
at
but
to
drive
straight
on
to
callernish
she
would
visit
the
people
at
some
other
day
the
boat
was
waiting
for
them
at
callernish
and
the
boat
was
the
pretty
she
is
how
have
you
kept
her
so
well
duncan
said
sheila
her
face
lighting
up
for
the
first
time
as
she
went
down
the
path
to
the
bright
painted
little
vessel
that
scarcely
rocked
in
the
water
below
we
neffer
knew
but
that
it
was
this
week
or
the
week
before
or
the
next
week
you
would
come
back
miss
sheila
and
you
would
want
your
boat
but
it
was
mackenzie
himself
it
wass
he
that
did
all
the
pentin
of
the
boat
and
it
iss
as
well
done
as
mcnicol
could
have
done
it
and
a
great
better
than
that
you
steer
her
yourself
sheila
her
father
suggested
glad
to
see
that
she
was
at
last
being
interested
and
pleased
yes
i
will
steer
her
if
i
have
not
forgotten
all
the
points
that
duncan
taught
me
i
am
sure
you
hef
not
done
that
miss
sheila
duncan
said
there
wass
no
one
knew
loch
roag
better
as
you
not
one
and
you
hef
not
been
so
long
away
and
when
you
tek
the
tiller
in
your
hand
it
will
all
come
back
to
you
just
as
if
you
wass
going
away
from
borva
the
day
before
she
certainly
had
not
forgotten
and
she
was
proud
and
pleased
to
see
how
well
the
shapely
little
craft
performed
its
duties
they
had
a
favorable
wind
and
ran
rapidly
along
the
opening
channels
until
in
due
course
they
glided
into
the
bay
over
which
and
shining
in
the
yellow
light
from
the
sunset
they
saw
home
sheila
had
escaped
so
far
the
trouble
of
meeting
friends
but
she
could
not
escape
her
friends
in
borvapost
they
had
waited
for
her
for
hours
not
knowing
when
the
clansman
might
arrive
at
stornoway
and
now
they
crowded
down
to
the
shore
and
there
was
a
great
shaking
of
hands
and
an
occasional
sob
from
some
old
crone
and
a
thousand
repetitions
of
the
familiar
are
you
ferry
well
miss
sheila
from
small
children
who
had
come
across
from
the
village
in
defiance
of
mothers
and
fathers
and
face
brightened
into
a
wonderful
gladness
and
she
had
a
hundred
questions
to
ask
for
one
answer
she
got
and
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
the
number
of
small
brown
fists
that
wanted
to
shake
hands
with
her
you
let
miss
sheila
alone
duncan
called
out
adding
something
in
gaelic
which
came
strangely
from
a
man
who
sometimes
reproved
his
own
master
for
swearing
away
with
you
you
brats
it
wass
better
you
would
be
in
your
beds
than
bothering
people
that
wass
come
all
the
way
from
then
they
all
went
up
in
a
body
to
the
house
and
scarlett
who
had
neither
eyes
ears
nor
hands
but
for
the
young
girl
who
had
been
the
very
pride
of
her
heart
was
nigh
driven
to
distraction
by
stormy
demands
for
oatcake
and
glasses
and
whisky
scarlett
angrily
remonstrated
with
her
husband
for
allowing
this
rabble
of
people
to
interfere
with
the
comfort
of
miss
sheila
and
duncan
taking
her
reproaches
with
great
contented
himself
with
doing
her
work
and
went
and
got
the
cheese
and
the
plates
and
the
whisky
while
scarlett
with
a
hundred
endearing
phrases
was
helping
sheila
to
take
off
her
traveling
things
and
sheila
it
turned
out
had
brought
with
her
in
her
portmanteau
certain
huge
and
wonderful
cakes
not
of
oatmeal
from
glasgow
and
these
were
soon
on
the
great
table
in
the
kitchen
and
sheila
herself
distributing
pieces
to
those
small
folks
who
were
so
by
the
sight
of
this
strange
dainty
that
they
forgot
their
injunctions
and
thanked
her
timidly
in
gaelic
sheila
my
lass
said
her
father
to
her
as
they
stood
at
the
door
of
the
house
and
watched
the
troop
of
their
friends
children
and
all
go
over
the
hill
to
borvapost
in
the
red
light
of
the
sunset
are
you
glad
to
be
home
again
yes
she
said
heartily
enough
and
mackenzie
thought
that
things
were
going
on
favorably
hef
no
such
sunsets
in
the
south
sheila
he
observed
loftily
casting
his
eyes
around
although
he
did
not
usually
pay
much
attention
to
the
picturesqueness
of
his
native
island
look
at
the
light
on
suainabhal
do
you
see
the
red
on
the
water
down
there
sheila
oh
yes
i
thought
you
would
say
it
wass
ferry
beautiful
it
is
a
ferry
good
color
on
the
water
the
water
looks
ferry
well
when
it
is
red
you
hef
no
such
things
in
london
not
any
sheila
now
we
must
go
for
these
things
you
can
see
any
day
here
and
we
must
not
keep
our
friends
an
ordinary
or
careless
man
might
have
been
glad
to
have
a
little
quiet
after
so
long
and
tedious
a
journey
but
mackenzie
was
no
such
person
he
had
resolved
to
guard
against
first
evening
at
home
being
in
any
way
languid
or
monotonous
and
so
he
had
asked
one
or
two
of
his
especial
friends
to
remain
and
have
supper
with
them
moreover
he
did
not
wish
the
girl
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
evening
out
of
doors
when
the
melancholy
time
of
the
twilight
drew
over
the
hills
and
the
sea
began
to
sound
remote
and
sad
sheila
should
have
a
comfortable
evening
and
he
would
himself
after
supper
when
the
small
parlor
was
well
lit
up
sing
for
her
one
or
two
songs
just
to
keep
the
thing
going
as
it
were
he
would
let
nobody
else
sing
these
gaelic
songs
were
not
the
sort
of
music
to
make
people
cheerful
and
if
sheila
herself
would
sing
for
them
and
sheila
did
and
her
father
chose
the
songs
for
her
and
they
were
the
blithest
he
could
find
and
the
girl
seemed
really
in
excellent
spirits
they
had
their
pipes
and
hot
whisky
and
water
in
this
little
parlor
mackenzie
explaining
that
although
his
daughter
was
accustomed
to
spacious
and
gilded
where
such
a
thing
was
impossible
she
would
do
anything
to
make
her
friends
welcome
and
comfortable
and
they
might
fill
their
glasses
and
their
pipes
with
impunity
and
sheila
sang
again
and
again
all
cheerful
and
sensible
english
songs
and
she
listened
to
the
odd
jokes
and
stories
her
friends
had
to
tell
her
and
mackenzie
was
delighted
with
the
success
of
his
plans
and
precautions
was
not
her
very
appearance
now
a
triumph
she
was
laughing
smiling
talking
to
every
one
he
had
not
seen
her
so
happy
for
many
a
day
in
the
midst
of
it
all
when
the
night
had
come
apace
what
was
this
wild
skirl
outside
that
made
everybody
start
mackenzie
jumped
to
his
feet
with
an
angry
vow
in
his
heart
that
if
this
of
a
piper
should
come
down
the
hill
playing
no
more
or
til
mi
tuladh
or
any
other
mournful
tune
he
would
have
his
chanter
broken
in
a
thousand
splinters
over
his
head
but
what
was
the
wild
air
that
came
nearer
and
nearer
until
john
marched
into
the
house
and
came
with
ribbons
and
pipes
to
the
very
door
of
the
room
which
was
flung
open
to
him
not
a
very
appropriate
air
perhaps
for
it
was
the
campbells
are
coming
oho
oho
the
campbells
are
coming
oho
oho
the
campbells
are
coming
to
bonny
lochleven
the
campbells
are
coming
oho
oho
but
it
was
to
rare
delight
a
right
good
joyous
tune
and
it
was
meant
as
a
welcome
to
sheila
and
forthwith
he
caught
the
piper
by
the
shoulder
and
dragged
him
in
and
said
down
your
pipes
and
come
into
the
house
john
put
down
your
pipes
and
tek
off
your
bonnet
and
we
shall
hef
a
good
dram
together
this
night
by
kott
and
it
is
sheila
herself
will
pour
out
the
whisky
for
you
john
and
she
is
a
good
highland
girl
and
she
knows
the
piper
was
never
born
that
could
be
hurt
by
whisky
and
the
whisky
was
never
yet
made
that
could
hurt
a
piper
what
do
you
say
to
that
john
john
did
not
answer
he
was
standing
before
sheila
with
his
bonnet
in
his
hand
but
with
his
pipes
still
proudly
over
his
shoulder
and
he
took
the
glass
from
her
and
called
out
and
drained
every
drop
of
it
out
to
welcome
daughter

chapter
xxv
the
voyage
of
the
phœbe
it
was
a
cold
morning
in
january
and
up
here
among
the
jura
hills
the
clouds
had
melted
into
a
small
and
chilling
rain
that
fell
ceaselessly
the
great
of
were
hidden
in
the
mist
even
the
valleys
near
at
hand
were
vague
and
dismal
in
the
pale
fog
and
the
sound
of
islay
lying
below
and
the
far
sea
beyond
were
gradually
growing
indistinguishable
in
a
rude
little
sheiling
built
on
one
of
the
plateaus
of
rock
frank
lavender
sat
alone
listening
to
the
plashing
of
the
rain
without
a
rifle
that
he
had
just
carefully
dried
lay
across
his
knees
a
brace
of
had
stretched
out
their
paws
on
the
earthen
floor
and
had
put
their
long
noses
between
their
paws
to
produce
a
little
warmth
it
was
indeed
a
cold
and
damp
morning
and
the
little
hut
was
pervaded
with
a
smell
of
wet
wood
and
also
of
peat
ashes
for
one
of
the
gillies
had
tried
to
light
a
fire
but
the
peats
had
gone
out
it
was
lavender
who
had
let
the
fire
go
out
he
had
forgotten
it
he
was
thinking
of
other
things
of
a
song
mostly
that
sheila
used
to
sing
and
lines
of
it
went
hither
and
thither
through
his
brain
as
he
recalled
the
sound
of
her
voice
haste
to
thy
barque
coastwise
steer
not
sail
wide
of
mull
jura
near
not
farewell
she
said
her
last
pang
subduing
brave
mac
intyre
costly
thy
wooing
there
came
into
the
sheiling
a
little
wiry
old
keeper
with
shaggy
gray
hair
and
keen
black
eyes
bless
me
he
said
petulantly
as
he
wrung
the
rain
out
of
his
bonnet
hef
let
the
peats
go
out
mr
lavender
and
who
will
tell
when
the
rain
will
go
off
last
long
neil
it
came
on
too
suddenly
for
that
i
thought
we
were
going
to
get
one
fine
day
when
we
started
this
morning
but
you
often
manage
that
here
no
sir
said
neil
who
was
not
a
native
of
jura
and
was
as
eager
as
any
one
to
abuse
the
weather
prevailing
there
is
a
ferry
bad
place
for
the
weather
if
the
almichty
were
to
tek
the
sun
away
tagether
it
would
be
days
and
weeks
and
days
before
you
would
find
it
oot
but
it
iss
a
good
thing
sir
you
will
get
the
one
stag
before
the
mist
came
down
and
he
is
not
a
stag
mirover
but
a
fine
big
hart
and
a
royal
too
and
i
hef
not
seen
many
finer
in
the
jura
hills
oh
yes
sir
when
he
wass
crossing
the
burn
i
made
out
his
points
ferry
well
and
i
wass
saying
to
myself
if
mr
lavender
will
get
this
one
it
will
be
a
grand
day
this
day
and
it
will
make
up
for
many
a
wet
day
among
the
come
back
with
the
pony
yet
lavender
asked
laying
down
his
gun
and
going
to
the
door
of
the
hut
no
neil
said
following
him
iss
a
long
way
to
get
the
powny
and
maybe
they
will
stop
at
to
hef
a
dram
and
macdougall
was
saying
to
me
yesterday
that
the
ferry
next
time
you
wass
shoot
a
royal
he
would
hef
the
horns
dressed
and
the
head
stuffed
to
make
you
a
present
for
he
is
ferry
proud
of
the
picture
of
miss
margaret
and
he
will
say
to
me
sa
time
that
i
wass
to
gif
you
the
ferry
best
shooting
and
not
to
be
afraid
of
disturbing
sa
deer
when
you
had
a
mind
to
go
out
and
i
am
not
sure
sir
we
will
not
get
another
stag
to
tek
down
with
us
yet
if
the
wind
would
carry
away
the
mist
for
the
rain
that
is
nearly
on
now
and
as
you
are
ferry
wet
sir
already
it
is
no
matter
if
we
go
down
through
the
glen
and
cross
the
water
to
get
the
side
of
ben
is
true
enough
neil
and
i
fancy
the
clouds
are
beginning
to
lift
and
there
they
come
with
the
neil
directed
his
glass
toward
a
small
group
that
appeared
to
be
coming
up
the
side
of
the
valley
below
them
and
that
was
still
at
some
considerable
distance
bless
me
he
cried
is
that
there
iss
two
strangers
oh
yes
indeed
and
mirover
and
there
is
one
of
them
on
the
heart
leaped
within
him
if
they
were
strangers
they
were
coming
to
see
him
and
how
long
was
it
since
he
had
seen
the
face
of
any
of
his
old
friends
and
companions
it
seemed
to
him
years
it
a
man
or
a
woman
on
the
pony
neil
he
asked
hurriedly
with
some
wild
fancy
flashing
through
his
brain
me
the
it
is
a
man
said
neil
handing
over
the
glass
would
a
woman
be
doing
up
sa
hills
on
a
morning
like
this
the
small
party
below
came
up
out
of
the
gray
mist
and
lavender
in
the
distance
heard
a
long
tam
them
said
neil
at
a
venture
is
not
a
deer
on
benan
cabrach
that
will
not
hear
if
these
strangers
are
coming
to
see
me
i
fear
we
must
leave
the
deer
alone
well
sir
ferry
well
sir
it
is
a
bad
day
whatever
and
it
is
not
many
strangers
will
come
to
jura
i
suppose
they
hef
come
to
port
ascaig
and
taken
the
ferry
across
the
am
going
to
meet
them
on
chance
lavender
said
and
set
off
along
the
side
of
the
deep
valley
leaving
neil
with
the
dogs
and
the
rifles
johnny
he
cried
in
amazement
when
he
came
upon
the
advancing
group
you
too
mosenberg
by
jove
how
did
you
ever
get
here
there
was
an
abundance
of
handshaking
and
incoherent
questions
when
young
mosenberg
jumped
down
on
the
wet
heather
and
the
three
friends
had
actually
met
lavender
scarcely
knew
what
to
say
these
two
faces
were
so
strange
and
yet
so
familiar
their
appearance
there
was
so
unexpected
his
pleasure
so
great
believe
my
eyes
yet
johnny
why
did
you
bring
him
here
you
know
what
have
to
put
up
with
in
this
place
well
this
does
do
a
heart
good
i
am
awfully
pleased
to
see
you
and
it
is
very
kind
of
i
am
very
cold
the
handsome
jew
boy
said
swinging
his
arms
and
stamping
his
feet
boats
wet
carts
wet
roads
wet
saddles
and
everywhere
cold
cold
he
drink
whisky
so
what
is
he
to
expect
johnny
eyre
said
along
up
to
a
little
hut
here
lavender
said
try
to
get
a
fire
lit
and
i
have
some
brandy
you
have
plenty
of
water
to
mix
with
it
said
the
boy
looking
mournfully
around
good
let
us
have
the
fire
and
the
warm
drink
and
then
you
know
the
story
of
the
music
that
was
frozen
in
the
trumpet
and
that
all
came
out
when
it
was
thawed
at
a
fire
when
we
get
warm
we
have
very
great
news
to
tell
you
oh
very
great
news
want
any
news
i
want
your
company
come
along
like
good
fellows
and
leave
the
news
for
afterward
the
men
are
going
on
with
a
pony
to
fetch
a
stag
that
has
been
shot
they
be
back
for
an
hour
i
suppose
at
the
soonest
this
is
the
sheiling
up
here
where
the
brandy
is
secreted
now
neil
help
us
to
get
up
a
blaze
if
any
of
you
have
newspapers
letters
or
anything
that
will
set
a
few
sticks
on
fire
have
a
box
of
wax
matches
johnny
said
i
know
how
to
light
a
better
than
any
man
in
the
he
was
not
very
successful
at
first
for
the
peats
were
a
trifle
damp
but
in
the
end
he
conquered
and
a
very
fair
blaze
was
produced
although
the
smoke
that
had
filled
the
sheiling
had
nearly
blinded
eyes
then
lavender
produced
a
small
tin
pot
and
a
solitary
tumbler
and
they
boiled
some
water
and
lit
their
pipes
and
made
themselves
seats
of
peat
around
the
fire
all
the
while
a
brisk
conversation
was
going
on
some
portions
of
which
astonished
lavender
considerably
for
months
back
indeed
he
had
almost
cut
himself
off
from
the
civilized
world
his
address
was
known
to
one
or
two
persons
and
sometimes
they
sent
him
a
letter
but
he
was
a
bad
correspondent
the
news
of
his
death
did
not
reach
him
till
a
fortnight
after
the
funeral
and
then
it
was
by
a
singular
chance
that
he
noticed
it
in
the
columns
of
an
old
newspaper
is
the
only
thing
i
regret
about
coming
away
he
was
saying
to
those
two
friends
of
his
should
like
to
have
seen
the
old
woman
before
she
died
she
was
very
kind
to
said
johnny
eyre
with
a
shake
of
the
head
is
all
very
well
but
a
mere
outsider
like
myself
you
see
it
looks
to
me
a
little
unnatural
that
she
should
go
and
leave
her
money
to
a
mere
friend
and
not
to
her
own
am
very
glad
she
did
lavender
said
had
as
good
as
asked
her
to
do
it
long
before
and
ted
ingram
will
make
a
better
use
of
it
than
i
ever
is
all
very
well
for
you
to
say
so
now
after
all
this
fuss
about
those
two
pictures
but
suppose
she
had
left
you
to
starve
mind
suppositions
lavender
said
to
get
rid
of
the
subject
me
mosenberg
how
is
that
overture
of
yours
getting
on
is
nearly
finished
said
the
lad
with
a
flush
of
pleasure
i
have
shown
it
in
rough
to
two
or
three
good
friends
and
shall
i
tell
you
it
may
be
performed
at
the
crystal
palace
but
that
is
a
chance
and
the
fate
of
it
that
is
also
a
chance
but
you
you
have
succeeded
all
at
once
and
brilliantly
and
all
the
world
is
talking
of
you
and
yet
you
go
away
among
mountains
and
live
in
the
cold
and
wet
and
you
might
as
well
be
an
ungrateful
boy
it
is
lavender
cried
you
have
a
comfortable
fire
and
hot
and
biscuits
and
cigars
if
you
wish
and
you
talk
about
people
wishing
to
leave
these
things
and
die
you
know
that
in
half
an
time
you
will
see
that
pony
come
back
with
a
deer
a
royal
hart
slung
across
it
and
you
be
proud
when
macdougall
takes
you
out
and
gives
you
a
chance
of
driving
home
such
a
prize
then
you
will
carry
the
horns
back
to
london
and
you
will
have
them
put
up
and
you
will
discourse
to
your
friends
of
the
span
and
the
pearls
of
the
antlers
and
the
crockets
after
supper
you
will
see
the
horns
and
the
head
brought
into
the
room
and
if
you
fancy
that
you
yourself
shot
the
stag
you
will
see
that
this
life
among
the
hills
has
its
is
a
very
cold
life
the
lad
said
passing
his
hands
over
the
fire
is
because
you
drink
anything
said
johnny
eyre
against
whom
no
such
charge
could
be
wrought
you
know
that
the
drinking
of
whisky
is
a
provision
invented
by
nature
to
guard
human
beings
like
you
and
me
from
cold
and
wet
you
are
flying
in
the
face
of
providence
if
you
drink
whisky
among
the
scotch
have
you
people
to
talk
to
said
mosenberg
looking
at
lavender
with
a
vague
wonder
for
he
could
not
understand
why
any
man
could
choose
such
a
life
do
you
do
on
the
long
evenings
when
you
are
by
yourself
it
very
cheerful
but
it
does
a
man
good
service
sometimes
to
be
alone
for
a
time
it
lets
him
find
himself
ought
to
be
up
in
london
to
hear
all
the
praise
of
the
people
about
your
two
pictures
every
one
is
talking
of
them
the
newspapers
too
have
you
seen
the
newspapers
or
two
but
all
i
know
of
these
two
pictures
is
derived
from
offers
forwarded
me
by
the
secretary
at
the
exhibition
rooms
i
was
surprised
when
i
got
them
at
first
but
never
mind
them
tell
me
more
about
the
people
one
used
to
know
what
about
ingram
now
has
he
cut
the
board
of
trade
does
he
drive
in
the
park
is
he
still
in
his
rooms
in
sloane
street
you
have
had
no
letters
from
him
mosenberg
said
with
some
surprise
probably
he
does
not
know
where
i
am
in
any
case
he
is
going
to
be
married
mosenberg
cried
did
not
know
that
and
to
say
so
why
he
used
to
hate
her
but
that
was
before
he
knew
her
to
lorraine
and
it
is
amusing
she
is
so
proud
of
him
and
if
he
speaks
at
the
table
she
will
turn
away
from
you
as
if
you
were
not
worth
listening
to
and
have
all
her
attention
for
him
and
whatever
is
his
opinion
she
will
defend
that
and
you
must
not
disagree
with
her
oh
it
is
very
amusing
and
the
lad
laughed
and
shook
back
his
curls
is
an
odd
thing
lavender
said
many
a
time
long
before
ingram
ever
saw
lorraine
i
used
to
imagine
these
two
married
i
knew
she
was
just
the
sort
of
clever
independent
woman
to
see
strong
points
and
rate
them
at
their
proper
value
but
i
never
expected
anything
of
the
sort
of
course
for
i
had
always
a
notion
that
some
day
or
other
he
would
be
led
into
marrying
some
pretty
gentle
young
thing
whom
he
would
have
to
take
through
life
in
a
protecting
sort
of
way
and
who
would
never
be
a
real
companion
for
him
so
he
is
to
marry
lorraine
after
all
well
he
become
a
man
of
fashion
despite
all
his
money
he
is
sure
to
start
a
yacht
for
one
thing
and
they
will
travel
a
deal
i
suppose
i
must
write
and
congratulate
met
them
on
the
day
i
went
to
see
your
picture
mosenberg
said
lorraine
was
looking
at
it
a
long
time
and
at
last
she
came
back
and
said
sea
in
that
picture
makes
me
feel
that
was
a
compliment
was
it
not
only
you
can
not
get
a
good
view
very
often
for
the
people
will
not
stand
back
from
the
pictures
but
every
one
asks
why
you
do
not
keep
these
two
over
for
the
shall
have
other
two
for
the
academy
i
johnny
asked
with
a
practical
air
i
have
had
some
offers
but
i
prefer
to
leave
the
thing
open
but
you
have
not
told
me
how
you
got
here
yet
lavender
added
continually
breaking
away
from
the
subject
of
the
pictures
the
phœbe
eyre
said
she
in
the
bay
no
we
had
to
leave
her
at
port
ellen
to
get
a
few
small
repairs
done
and
mosenberg
and
i
came
on
by
road
to
port
ascaig
mind
you
she
was
quite
small
enough
to
come
round
the
mull
at
this
time
of
should
think
so
your
crew
men
and
a
lad
besides
mosenberg
and
myself
and
i
can
tell
you
we
had
our
hands
full
given
up
open
boats
with
stone
ballast
now
lavender
said
with
a
laugh
but
it
was
no
laughing
matter
eyre
added
with
a
sudden
gravity
coming
over
his
face
was
the
narrowest
squeak
i
ever
had
and
i
know
now
how
i
clung
on
to
that
place
till
the
day
broke
when
i
came
to
myself
and
called
out
for
you
i
never
expected
to
hear
you
answer
and
in
the
darkness
by
jove
your
voice
sounded
like
the
voice
of
a
ghost
how
you
managed
to
drag
me
so
far
up
that
i
imagine
and
then
the
dipping
down
and
under
the
boat
was
that
dip
down
that
saved
me
lavender
said
brought
me
to
and
made
me
scramble
like
a
rat
up
the
other
side
as
soon
as
i
felt
my
hands
on
the
rock
again
it
was
a
narrow
squeak
as
you
say
johnny
do
you
remember
how
black
the
place
looked
when
the
first
light
began
to
show
in
the
sky
and
how
we
kept
each
other
awake
by
calling
and
how
you
called
when
we
heard
donald
and
how
strange
it
was
to
find
ourselves
so
near
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
after
all
during
the
night
i
fancied
we
must
have
been
thrown
on
battle
island
you
do
not
like
to
hear
about
that
young
mosenberg
said
always
if
the
wind
came
on
strong
or
if
the
skies
grew
black
eyre
would
tell
me
all
the
story
over
again
when
we
were
in
the
boat
coming
down
by
arran
and
cantyre
let
us
go
out
and
see
if
they
come
with
the
deer
has
the
rain
stopped
at
this
moment
indeed
sounds
of
the
approaching
party
were
heard
and
when
lavender
and
his
friends
went
to
the
door
the
pony
with
the
deer
slung
on
to
him
was
just
coming
up
it
was
a
sufficiently
picturesque
sight
the
rude
little
sheiling
with
its
peat
fire
the
brown
and
wiry
gillies
the
slain
deer
roped
on
to
the
pony
and
all
around
the
wild
magnificence
of
hill
and
valley
clothed
in
moving
mists
the
rain
had
indeed
cleared
off
but
these
pale
white
fogs
still
clung
around
the
mountains
and
rendered
the
valleys
vague
and
lavender
informed
neil
that
he
would
make
no
further
effort
that
day
he
gave
the
men
a
glass
of
whisky
all
round
and
then
with
his
friends
he
proceeded
to
make
his
way
down
to
the
small
white
cottage
fronting
the
sound
of
islay
which
had
been
his
home
for
months
back
just
before
setting
off
however
he
managed
to
take
young
mosenberg
aside
for
a
moment
suppose
he
said
with
his
eyes
cast
down
suppose
you
heard
something
from
ingram
of
of
sheila
said
the
lad
rather
bashfully
had
heard
from
her
she
was
still
in
well
think
so
yes
said
mosenberg
and
then
he
added
with
some
hesitation
should
like
to
speak
to
you
about
it
when
we
have
the
opportunity
there
were
some
things
that
ingram
said
i
am
sure
he
would
like
you
to
know
was
no
message
to
me
lavender
asked
in
a
low
voice
her
no
but
it
was
the
opinion
of
ingram
never
mind
that
mosenberg
said
the
other
turning
away
wearily
suppose
you
find
it
too
fatiguing
to
walk
from
here
back
it
will
warm
you
you
know
and
the
old
woman
down
there
will
get
you
something
to
eat
you
may
make
it
luncheon
or
dinner
as
you
like
for
it
will
be
nearly
two
by
the
time
you
get
down
then
you
can
go
for
a
prowl
around
the
coast
if
it
does
not
rain
i
shall
be
working
as
long
as
there
is
daylight
then
we
can
have
a
dinner
and
supper
combined
in
the
evening
you
will
get
venison
and
you
ever
have
anything
else
yes
the
venison
will
be
in
honor
of
you
i
generally
have
mutton
and
here
lavender
the
lad
said
with
considerable
confusion
fact
is
eyre
and
i
we
brought
you
a
few
things
in
the
phœbe
a
little
wine
you
know
and
some
such
things
if
you
could
get
a
passenger
to
go
down
to
port
ellen
but
no
i
suppose
we
must
go
and
work
the
boat
up
the
you
do
that
i
must
go
with
you
lavender
said
the
chances
are
that
your
skipper
know
the
currents
in
the
sound
and
they
are
rather
peculiar
i
can
tell
you
so
johnny
and
you
have
brought
me
some
wine
i
wish
we
had
it
now
to
celebrate
your
arrival
for
i
am
afraid
i
can
offer
you
nothing
but
the
old
highland
woman
who
had
charge
of
the
odd
little
cottage
in
which
lavender
lived
was
put
into
a
state
of
violent
consternation
by
the
arrival
of
these
two
strangers
but
as
lavender
said
he
would
sleep
on
a
couple
of
chairs
and
give
his
bed
to
mosenberg
and
the
sofa
to
eyre
and
as
mosenberg
declared
that
the
house
was
a
marvel
of
neatness
and
comfort
and
as
johnny
assured
her
that
he
had
frequently
slept
in
a
she
grew
gradually
pacified
there
was
a
little
difficulty
about
plates
and
knives
and
forks
at
luncheon
which
consisted
of
cold
mutton
and
two
bottles
of
ale
that
had
somehow
been
overlooked
but
all
these
minor
inconveniences
were
soon
smoothed
over
and
then
lavender
carrying
his
canvas
under
his
arm
and
a
portable
easel
over
his
shoulder
went
down
to
the
shore
bade
his
companions
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
left
them
to
explore
the
winding
and
rocky
coast
of
jura
in
the
evening
they
had
dinner
in
a
small
parlor
which
was
pretty
well
filled
with
a
chest
of
drawers
a
sofa
and
a
series
of
large
canvases
there
was
a
burning
in
the
grate
and
two
candles
on
the
table
but
the
small
room
did
not
get
oppressively
hot
for
each
time
the
door
was
opened
a
draught
of
cold
rushed
in
from
the
passage
sometimes
blowing
out
one
of
the
candles
but
always
sweetening
the
atmosphere
then
johnny
had
some
fine
tobacco
with
him
and
mosenberg
had
brought
lavender
a
present
of
a
meerschaum
pipe
and
presently
a
small
kettle
of
hot
water
was
put
in
requisition
and
the
friends
drew
round
the
fire
it
good
of
you
to
come
and
see
a
fellow
like
this
lavender
said
with
a
very
apparent
and
hearty
gratitude
in
his
face
can
scarcely
believe
my
eyes
that
it
is
true
and
can
you
make
any
stay
johnny
have
you
brought
your
colors
with
you
no
i
mean
to
work
johnny
said
have
always
had
a
fancy
for
a
cruise
a
hardening
sort
of
thing
you
know
you
soon
get
used
to
it
you
mosenberg
and
johnny
grinned
yet
i
may
afterward
said
the
lad
at
present
this
is
more
comfortable
than
being
on
deck
at
night
when
it
rains
and
you
know
not
where
you
are
that
was
only
your
own
perversity
you
might
just
as
well
have
stopped
in
the
cabin
and
played
that
cornopean
and
made
yourself
warm
and
comfortable
really
lavender
very
good
fun
and
if
you
only
watch
for
decent
weather
you
can
go
anywhere
fancy
our
coming
around
the
mull
with
the
phœbe
yesterday
and
we
had
quite
a
pleasant
trip
across
to
where
do
you
propose
to
go
after
leaving
jura
lavender
asked
you
know
the
main
object
of
our
cruise
was
to
come
and
see
you
but
if
you
care
to
come
with
us
for
a
few
days
we
will
go
wherever
you
you
are
going
farther
north
i
must
go
with
you
lavender
said
you
are
bound
to
drown
yourself
some
day
johnny
if
some
one
take
care
of
there
was
no
deep
design
in
this
project
of
but
he
had
had
a
vague
impression
that
lavender
might
like
to
go
north
if
only
to
have
a
passing
glimpse
at
the
island
he
used
to
know
of
my
fellows
is
well
acquainted
with
the
hebrides
he
said
you
think
it
too
much
of
a
risk
i
should
like
it
myself
for
those
northern
islands
must
look
uncommonly
wild
and
savage
in
winter
and
one
likes
to
have
new
experiences
fancy
mosenberg
what
material
you
will
get
for
your
next
piece
it
will
be
full
of
storms
and
seas
and
thunder
you
know
how
the
wind
whistles
through
the
overture
to
the
de
la
will
whistle
through
us
said
the
boy
with
an
anticipatory
shiver
i
do
not
mind
the
wind
if
it
is
not
wet
it
is
the
wet
that
makes
a
boat
so
disagreeable
everything
is
so
cold
and
clammy
you
can
touch
nothing
and
when
you
put
your
head
up
in
the
morning
pah
a
dash
of
rain
and
mist
and
salt
water
altogether
gives
you
a
made
you
come
around
the
mull
johnny
instead
of
cutting
through
the
crinan
lavender
asked
of
his
friend
said
the
youth
modestly
except
that
two
or
three
men
said
we
do
thought
so
lavender
said
i
see
i
must
go
with
you
johnny
you
must
play
no
more
of
these
tricks
you
must
watch
your
time
and
run
her
quietly
up
the
sound
of
jura
to
crinan
and
watch
again
and
get
her
up
to
oban
and
watch
again
and
get
her
up
to
loch
sligachan
then
you
may
consider
it
is
quite
possible
you
may
have
fine
clear
weather
if
there
is
a
moderate
northeast
wind
blowing
northeast
wind
mosenberg
cried
lavender
replied
confidently
for
he
had
not
forgotten
what
sheila
used
to
teach
him
is
your
only
chance
if
you
have
been
living
in
fog
and
rain
for
a
fortnight
you
will
never
forget
your
gratitude
to
a
northeaster
when
it
suddenly
sets
in
to
lift
the
clouds
and
show
you
a
bit
of
blue
sky
but
it
may
knock
us
about
a
bit
in
crossing
the
have
come
around
the
mull
and
we
can
go
anywhere
johnny
said
back
the
phœbe
to
take
you
safely
to
the
west
indies
you
mosenberg
no
the
boy
said
would
back
her
to
take
you
not
to
take
two
or
three
days
thereafter
the
phœbe
was
brought
up
the
sound
from
port
ellen
and
such
things
as
were
meant
as
a
present
to
lavender
were
landed
then
the
three
friends
embarked
for
the
weather
had
cleared
considerably
and
there
was
indeed
when
they
set
out
a
pale
wintry
sunshine
gleaming
on
the
sea
and
on
the
white
deck
and
spars
of
the
handsome
little
cutter
which
johnny
commanded
the
phœbe
was
certainly
a
great
improvement
on
the
crank
craft
in
which
he
used
to
adventure
his
life
on
loch
fyne
she
was
big
enough
indeed
to
give
plenty
of
work
to
everybody
on
board
of
her
and
when
she
had
once
got
into
harbor
and
things
put
to
rights
her
chief
stateroom
proved
a
jolly
and
comfortable
little
place
enough
they
had
some
pleasant
evenings
in
this
way
after
the
work
of
the
day
was
over
when
the
swinging
lamps
shone
down
on
the
table
that
was
furnished
with
glasses
bottles
cigars
and
cards
johnny
was
very
proud
of
being
in
command
and
of
his
exploit
in
doubling
the
mull
he
was
continually
consulting
charts
and
compasses
and
going
on
deck
to
communicate
his
last
opinion
to
his
skipper
mosenberg
too
was
getting
better
accustomed
to
the
hardships
of
yachting
and
learning
how
to
secure
a
fair
amount
of
comfort
lavender
never
said
that
he
wished
to
go
near
lewis
but
there
was
a
tacit
understanding
that
their
voyage
should
tend
in
that
direction
they
had
a
little
rough
weather
on
reaching
skye
and
in
consequence
remained
in
harbor
a
couple
of
days
at
the
end
of
that
time
a
happy
opportunity
presented
itself
of
cutting
across
the
little
minch
the
great
minch
was
considered
a
trifle
risky
to
loch
maddy
in
north
uist
they
were
now
in
the
western
islands
and
strange
indeed
was
the
appearance
which
the
bleak
region
presented
at
this
time
of
the
year
the
lonely
coast
the
multitudes
of
wild
fowl
the
wondering
inhabitants
the
treeless
wastes
and
desolate
rocks
what
these
remote
and
melancholy
islands
might
have
looked
like
in
fog
and
misty
rain
could
only
be
imagined
however
for
fortunately
the
northeaster
had
set
in
and
there
were
wan
glimmerings
of
sunshine
across
the
sea
and
the
solitary
shores
they
remained
in
loch
maddy
but
a
single
day
and
then
still
favored
by
a
brisk
northeast
breeze
made
their
way
through
the
sound
of
harris
and
got
to
leeward
of
the
conjoint
island
of
harris
and
lewis
there
indeed
were
the
great
mountains
which
lavender
had
seen
many
a
time
from
the
north
and
now
they
were
close
at
hand
and
dark
and
forbidding
the
days
were
brief
at
this
time
and
they
were
glad
to
put
into
loch
resort
which
lavender
had
once
seen
in
company
with
old
mackenzie
when
they
had
come
into
the
neighborhood
on
a
excursion
the
phœbe
was
at
her
anchorage
the
clatter
on
deck
over
and
johnny
came
below
to
see
what
sort
of
repast
could
be
got
for
the
evening
it
was
not
a
very
grand
meal
but
he
said
propose
that
we
have
a
bottle
of
champagne
to
celebrate
our
arrival
at
the
island
of
lewis
did
you
ever
see
anything
more
successfully
done
and
now
if
this
wind
continues
we
can
creep
up
to
loch
roag
lavender
if
you
would
like
to
have
a
look
at
for
a
moment
the
color
forsook
face
thank
you
johnny
he
was
about
to
say
when
his
friend
interrupted
him
here
lavender
i
know
you
would
like
to
see
the
place
and
you
can
do
it
easily
without
being
seen
no
one
knows
me
when
we
anchor
in
the
bay
i
suppose
mackenzie
as
is
the
hospitable
and
praiseworthy
custom
in
these
parts
will
send
a
message
to
the
yacht
and
ask
us
to
dine
with
him
i
at
any
rate
can
go
up
and
call
on
him
and
make
excuses
for
you
and
then
i
could
tell
you
you
know
johnny
hesitated
you
do
that
for
me
johnny
lavender
said
you
are
a
good
fellow
johnny
said
lightly
a
capital
adventure
for
me
and
perhaps
i
could
ask
mackenzie
mackenzie
i
beg
your
pardon
to
let
me
have
two
or
three
clay
pipes
for
this
is
rapidly
going
to
the
will
give
you
anything
he
has
in
the
house
you
never
saw
such
a
hospitable
fellow
johnny
but
you
must
take
great
care
what
you
must
trust
to
me
in
the
meantime
see
what
pate
knows
about
loch
johnny
called
down
his
skipper
a
bluff
short
man
who
presently
appeared
his
cap
in
his
hand
you
have
a
glass
of
champagne
pate
ay
sir
he
said
not
very
eagerly
you
rather
have
a
glass
of
whisky
sir
pate
said
in
accents
that
showed
that
his
highland
pronunciation
had
been
corrupted
by
many
residence
in
greenock
was
the
whisky
was
a
wee
thing
better
for
ye
on
a
cauld
you
are
then
now
tell
me
do
you
know
loch
roag
ay
fine
the
time
i
hiv

lavender
you

the
loch

you
know
the
bay

which
house

but

bit

borvapost

lavender
said
think
i
can
tell
you
how
to
go
i
know
the
channel
is
quite
simple
there
are
no
rocks
about
and
once
you
are
round
the
point
you
will
see
your
twa
or
three
years
since
i
was
there
sir
pate
remarked
as
he
put
the
glass
back
on
the
table
mind
there
was
a
daft
auld
man
there
that
played
the
was
old
john
the
piper
lavender
said
you
remember
mackenzie
whom
they
call
the
king
of
borva
sir
i
never
saw
him
but
i
was
aware
he
was
in
the
place
i
have
never
been
up
here
afore
a
party
of
gentlemen
and
he
wasna
coming
down
to
see
the
like
with
what
a
strange
feeling
lavender
beheld
the
following
afternoon
the
opening
to
the
great
loch
that
he
knew
so
well
he
recognized
the
various
rocky
promontories
the
gaelic
names
of
which
sheila
had
translated
for
him
down
there
in
the
south
were
the
great
heights
of
suainabhal
and
cracabahl
and
mealasabhal
right
in
front
was
the
sweep
of
borvapost
bay
and
its
huts
and
its
small
garden
patches
and
up
beyond
it
was
the
hill
on
which
sheila
used
to
sit
in
the
evening
to
watch
the
sun
go
down
behind
the
atlantic
it
was
like
entering
again
a
world
with
which
he
had
once
been
familiar
and
in
which
he
had
left
behind
a
peaceful
happiness
he
had
sought
in
vain
elsewhere
somehow
as
the
yacht
dipped
to
the
waves
and
slowly
made
her
way
into
the
loch
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
coming
home
that
he
was
returning
to
the
old
and
quiet
joys
he
had
experienced
there
that
all
the
past
time
that
had
darkened
his
life
was
now
to
be
removed
but
when
at
last
he
saw
house
high
up
there
over
the
tiny
bay
a
strange
thrill
of
excitement
passed
through
him
and
that
was
followed
by
a
cold
feeling
of
despair
which
he
did
not
seek
to
remove
he
stood
on
the
companion
his
head
only
being
visible
and
directed
pate
until
the
phœbe
had
arrived
at
her
moorings
and
then
he
went
below
he
had
looked
wistfully
for
a
time
up
to
the
square
dark
house
with
its
scarlet
copings
in
the
vague
hope
of
seeing
some
figure
he
knew
but
now
sick
at
heart
and
fearing
that
mackenzie
might
make
him
out
with
a
glass
he
sat
down
in
the
alone
and
silent
and
miserable
he
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
oars
and
got
up
and
listened
mosenberg
came
down
and
said
mackenzie
has
sent
a
tall
thin
man
do
you
know
him
to
see
who
we
are
and
whether
we
will
go
up
to
his
did
eyre
say
know
i
suppose
he
is
then
johnny
himself
came
below
he
was
a
sensitive
young
fellow
and
at
this
moment
he
was
very
confused
excited
and
nervous
he
said
stammering
somewhat
am
going
up
now
to
house
you
know
whom
i
shall
see
shall
i
take
any
message
if
i
see
a
chance
if
your
name
is
mentioned
a
hint
you
know
her
lavender
said
with
a
sudden
pallor
of
determination
in
his
face
but
he
stopped
and
said
abruptly
mind
johnny
say
anything
about
anyway
johnny
said
to
himself
as
he
drew
on
his
best
jacket
with
its
shining
brass
buttons
and
went
up
the
companion
to
see
if
the
small
boat
was
ready
johnny
had
had
a
good
deal
of
knocking
about
the
western
highlands
and
was
familiar
with
the
frank
and
ready
hospitality
which
the
local
lairds
more
particularly
in
the
remote
islands
where
a
stranger
brought
recent
newspapers
and
a
breath
of
the
outer
world
with
him
granted
to
all
comers
who
bore
with
them
the
credentials
of
owning
a
yacht
but
never
before
had
he
gone
up
to
a
strange
house
with
such
perturbation
of
spirit
he
had
been
so
anxious
too
that
he
had
left
no
time
for
preparation
when
he
started
up
the
hill
he
could
see
in
the
gathering
dusk
that
the
tall
keeper
had
just
entered
the
house
and
when
he
arrived
there
he
found
absolutely
nobody
about
the
place
in
ordinary
circumstances
he
would
simply
have
walked
in
and
called
some
one
from
the
kitchen
but
he
now
felt
himself
somewhat
of
a
spy
and
was
not
a
little
afraid
of
meeting
the
handsome
mrs
lavender
of
whom
he
had
heard
so
much
there
was
no
light
in
the
passage
but
there
was
a
bright
red
gloom
in
one
of
the
windows
and
almost
inadvertently
he
glanced
in
there
what
was
this
strange
picture
he
saw
the
red
flame
of
the
fire
showed
him
the
grand
figures
on
the
walls
of
and
lit
up
the
white
and
the
crystal
in
the
middle
of
the
apartment
a
beautiful
young
girl
clad
in
a
tight
blue
dress
had
just
arisen
from
beside
the
fire
to
light
two
candles
that
were
on
the
table
and
then
she
went
back
to
her
seat
and
took
up
her
sewing
but
not
to
sew
for
johnny
saw
her
gently
kneel
down
beside
a
little
bassinet
that
was
a
mass
of
wonderful
pink
and
white
and
he
supposed
the
door
in
the
passage
was
open
for
he
could
hear
a
low
voice
humming
some
sung
by
the
young
mother
to
her
child
he
went
back
a
step
bewildered
by
what
he
had
seen
could
he
fly
down
to
the
shore
and
bring
lavender
up
to
look
at
this
picture
through
the
window
and
beg
of
him
to
go
in
and
throw
himself
on
her
forgiveness
and
mercy
he
had
not
time
to
think
twice
at
this
moment
mairi
appeared
in
the
dusky
passage
looking
a
little
scared
although
she
did
not
drop
the
plates
she
carried
sir
and
are
you
the
gentleman
that
has
come
in
the
yacht
and
mackenzie
he
is
upstairs
just
now
but
he
will
be
down
ferry
soon
and
will
you
come
in
and
speak
to
miss
sheila
sheila
he
repeated
to
himself
with
amazement
and
the
next
moment
he
found
himself
before
this
beautiful
young
girl
apologizing
to
her
stammering
and
wishing
that
he
had
never
undertaken
such
a
task
while
he
knew
that
all
the
time
she
was
calmly
regarding
him
with
her
large
calm
and
gentle
eyes
and
that
there
was
no
trace
of
embarrassment
in
her
manner
you
take
a
seat
by
the
fire
until
papa
comes
down
she
said
are
very
glad
to
have
any
one
come
to
see
us
we
do
not
have
many
visitors
in
the
i
am
afraid
he
stammered
am
putting
you
to
trouble
and
he
glanced
at
the
swinging
pink
and
white
couch
no
sheila
said
with
a
smile
was
just
about
to
send
my
little
boy
to
she
lifted
the
sleeping
child
and
rolled
it
in
some
enormous
covering
of
white
and
fur
and
gave
the
small
bundle
to
mairi
to
carry
to
scarlett
a
bit
johnny
called
out
to
mairi
and
the
girl
started
and
looked
around
whereupon
he
said
to
sheila
with
much
blushing
there
a
superstition
about
an
infant
waking
to
find
silver
in
its
hands
i
am
sure
you
mind
my
can
not
hold
anything
yet
sheila
said
with
a
smile
mairi
you
must
put
this
below
his
pillow
is
not
that
the
same
thing
for
luck
he
said
addressing
the
young
highland
girl
as
if
he
had
known
her
all
his
life
and
mairi
went
away
proud
and
pleased
to
have
this
precious
bundle
to
carry
and
talking
to
it
with
a
thousand
soft
and
endearing
phrases
in
her
native
tongue
mackenzie
came
in
and
found
the
two
talking
together
do
you
do
sir
he
said
with
a
grave
courtesy
are
ferry
welcome
to
the
island
and
if
there
is
anything
you
want
for
the
boat
you
will
hef
it
from
us
she
is
a
little
thing
to
hef
come
so
not
very
big
johnny
said
a
thorough
good
sailer
and
then
we
watch
our
time
you
know
but
i
think
we
shall
go
farther
north
than
you
no
friends
on
board
with
you
mackenzie
asked
yes
johnny
answered
but
we
did
not
wish
to
invade
your
house
in
a
body
said
mackenzie
impatiently
but
duncan
come
here
duncan
go
down
to
the
boat
that
has
just
come
in
and
tell
the
gentlemen
beg
your
pardon
sir
johnny
cried
my
two
friends
are
regularly
done
up
tired
they
were
just
going
to
turn
in
when
i
left
the
yacht
now
you
will
see
ferry
well
ferry
well
said
mackenzie
who
had
hoped
to
have
a
big
dinner
party
for
amusement
any
way
you
will
stop
and
hef
some
dinner
it
is
just
ready
oh
yes
and
it
is
not
a
ferry
fine
dinner
but
it
will
be
different
from
your
cabin
for
you
to
sit
if
you
will
excuse
me
johnny
was
about
to
say
for
he
was
so
full
of
the
news
he
had
to
tell
that
he
would
have
sacrificed
twenty
dinners
to
get
off
at
this
moment
but
mackenzie
would
take
no
denial
an
additional
cover
was
laid
for
the
stranger
and
johnny
sat
down
to
stare
at
sheila
in
a
furtive
way
and
to
talk
to
her
father
about
everything
that
was
happening
in
the
great
world
what
now
is
this
said
mackenzie
with
a
lofty
and
careless
air
is
this
i
see
in
the
papers
about
pictures
painted
by
a
gentleman
called
lavender
i
hef
a
great
interest
in
these
exhibitions
perhaps
you
hef
seen
the
pictures
johnny
blushed
very
red
but
he
hid
his
face
over
his
plate
and
presently
he
answered
without
daring
to
look
at
sheila
should
think
i
have
seen
them
why
if
you
care
for
coast
landscapes
i
can
tell
you
you
never
saw
such
thorough
good
work
in
all
your
life
why
talking
of
them
you
never
heard
of
a
man
making
such
a
name
for
himself
in
so
short
a
he
ventured
to
look
up
there
was
a
strange
proud
light
in
the
face
and
the
effect
of
it
on
this
bearer
of
good
tidings
was
to
make
him
launch
into
such
praises
of
these
pictures
as
considerably
astonished
old
mackenzie
as
for
sheila
she
was
proud
and
happy
but
not
surprised
she
had
known
it
all
along
she
had
waited
for
it
patiently
and
it
had
come
at
last
although
she
was
not
to
share
in
his
triumph
know
some
people
who
know
him
said
johnny
who
had
taken
two
or
three
glasses
of
sherry
and
felt
bold
what
a
shame
it
is
he
should
go
away
from
all
his
friends
and
almost
cease
to
have
any
communication
with
them
and
then
of
all
the
places
in
the
world
to
spend
the
winter
in
jura
is
about
the
said
sheila
quickly
and
he
fancied
that
her
face
paled
somewhat
believe
so
he
said
on
the
western
coast
you
know
over
the
sound
of
sheila
was
obviously
very
much
agitated
but
her
father
said
in
a
careless
way
yes
jura
is
not
a
ferry
good
place
in
the
winter
and
the
west
side
you
said
ay
there
are
not
many
houses
on
the
west
side
it
is
not
a
ferry
good
place
to
live
in
but
it
will
be
ferry
cheap
think
that
is
the
reason
of
his
living
there
said
johnny
with
a
laugh
mackenzie
urged
rather
anxiously
wass
not
saying
he
would
get
much
for
these
pictures
oh
no
who
will
give
much
money
for
pictures
of
rocks
and
oh
no
they
though
johnny
cried
give
a
deal
more
for
that
sort
of
picture
now
than
for
the
with
a
young
lady
dressed
in
a
drugget
petticoat
and
a
pink
jacket
sitting
peeling
potatoes
you
make
any
mistake
about
that
the
public
are
beginning
to
learn
what
real
good
work
is
and
by
jove
they
pay
for
it
too
lavender
got
eight
hundred
pounds
for
the
smaller
of
the
two
pictures
i
told
you
johnny
eyre
was
beginning
to
forget
that
the
knowledge
he
was
showing
of
frank
affairs
was
suspiciously
minute
no
sir
mackenzie
said
with
a
frown
is
all
nonsense
the
stories
that
you
hear
i
hef
had
great
experience
of
these
exhibitions
i
hef
been
to
london
several
times
and
every
time
i
wass
in
the
i
should
know
something
of
it
too
for
i
am
an
artist
do
you
get
eight
hundred
pounds
for
a
small
picture
mackenzie
asked
severely
no
said
johnny
with
a
laugh
then
i
am
a
after
dinner
sheila
left
the
room
johnny
fancied
he
knew
where
she
was
going
he
pulled
in
a
chair
to
the
fire
lit
his
pipe
and
said
he
would
have
but
one
glass
of
toddy
which
mackenzie
proceeded
to
make
for
him
and
then
he
said
to
the
old
king
of
borva
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
will
you
allow
me
to
suggest
that
that
young
girl
who
was
in
here
before
dinner
should
not
call
your
daughter
miss
sheila
before
strangers
it
is
very
foolish
said
mackenzie
it
is
an
old
habit
and
they
will
not
stop
it
and
duncan
he
is
worse
than
any
i
suppose
is
the
tall
fellow
who
waited
at
dinner
ay
that
is
ingenious
bit
of
stratagem
had
failed
he
wanted
to
have
old
mackenzie
call
his
daughter
mrs
lavender
so
that
he
might
have
had
occasion
to
open
the
question
and
plead
for
his
friend
but
the
old
man
resolutely
ignored
the
relationship
between
lavender
and
his
daughter
so
far
as
this
stranger
was
concerned
and
so
johnny
had
to
go
away
partly
disappointed
but
another
opportunity
might
occur
and
in
the
meantime
was
not
he
carrying
rare
news
down
to
the
phœbe
he
had
lingered
too
long
in
the
house
but
now
he
made
up
for
lost
time
and
once
or
twice
nearly
missed
his
footing
in
running
down
the
steep
path
he
had
to
find
the
small
boat
for
himself
and
go
out
on
the
slippery
stones
and
seaweed
to
get
into
her
then
he
pulled
away
from
the
shore
his
oars
striking
white
fire
into
the
dark
water
the
water
gurgling
at
the
bow
then
he
got
into
the
shadow
of
the
black
hull
of
the
yacht
and
pate
was
there
to
lower
the
little
gangway
when
johnny
stepped
on
deck
he
paused
in
considerable
doubt
as
to
what
he
should
do
he
wished
to
have
a
word
with
lavender
alone
how
could
he
go
down
with
such
a
message
as
he
had
to
deliver
to
a
couple
of
fellows
probably
smoking
and
playing
chess
he
said
mr
lavender
i
want
him
to
come
on
deck
for
a
by
sir
pate
said
been
sitting
by
for
the
last
hour
the
young
lain
johnny
went
down
into
the
little
cabin
lavender
who
had
neither
book
nor
cigar
nor
any
other
sign
of
occupation
near
him
seemed
in
his
painful
anxiety
almost
incapable
of
asking
the
question
that
rose
to
his
lips
you
seen
her
johnny
he
said
at
length
with
his
face
looking
strangely
careworn
johnny
was
an
impressionable
young
fellow
there
were
tears
running
freely
down
his
cheeks
as
he
said
i
have
lavender
and
she
was
rocking
a
child
in
a
chapter
xxvi
redintegratio
amoris
that
same
night
sheila
dreamed
a
strange
dream
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
an
angel
of
god
came
to
her
and
stood
before
her
and
looked
at
her
with
his
shining
face
and
his
sad
eyes
and
he
said
you
a
woman
and
yet
slow
to
forgive
are
you
a
mother
and
have
you
no
love
for
the
father
of
your
child
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
not
answer
she
fell
on
her
knees
before
him
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
wept
and
when
she
raised
her
eyes
again
the
angel
was
gone
and
in
his
place
ingram
was
there
stretching
out
his
hand
to
her
and
bidding
her
rise
and
be
comforted
yet
he
too
spoke
in
the
same
reproachful
tones
and
said
would
become
of
us
all
sheila
if
none
of
our
actions
were
to
be
condoned
by
time
and
repentance
what
would
become
of
us
if
we
could
not
say
at
some
particular
point
of
our
lives
to
the
time
that
we
had
left
it
with
all
its
errors
and
blunders
and
follies
behind
us
and
would
with
the
help
of
god
start
clear
on
a
new
sort
of
life
what
would
it
be
if
there
were
no
forgetfulness
for
any
of
us
no
kindly
vail
to
come
down
and
shut
out
the
memory
of
what
we
have
done
if
the
staring
record
were
to
be
kept
forever
before
our
eyes
and
you
are
a
woman
sheila
it
should
be
easy
for
you
to
forgive
and
to
encourage
and
to
hope
for
better
things
of
the
man
you
love
has
he
not
suffered
enough
have
you
no
word
for
him
the
sound
of
her
sobbing
in
the
brought
her
father
to
the
door
he
tapped
at
the
door
and
said
is
the
matter
sheila
she
awoke
with
a
slight
cry
and
he
went
into
the
room
and
found
her
in
a
strangely
troubled
state
her
hands
outstretched
to
him
her
eyes
wet
and
wild
i
have
been
very
cruel
i
am
not
fit
to
live
any
more
there
is
no
woman
in
the
world
would
have
done
what
i
have
he
said
hef
been
dreaming
again
about
all
that
folly
and
nonsense
lie
down
like
a
good
lass
you
will
wake
the
boy
if
you
do
not

down
and
go
to
sleep
and
we
will
pay
a
visit
to
the
yacht

not
possible
at
all
sheila
but
i
will
go
to
jura
oh
yes
i
will
go
to
jura
indeed
i
was
thinking
last
night
that
i
would
go
to
no
must
not
go
she
cried
would
speak
harshly
and
he
is
very
proud
and
we
should
never
see
each
other
again
papa
i
know
you
will
do
this
for
me
you
will
let
me
is
foolish
of
you
sheila
her
father
said
think
that
i
do
not
know
how
to
arrange
such
a
thing
without
making
a
quarrel
of
it
but
you
will
see
all
about
it
in
the
morning
just
now
you
will
lie
down
like
a
good
lass
and
go
to
sleep
so
sheila
and
do
not
think
of
it
any
more
till
the
she
thought
of
it
all
through
the
night
however
she
thought
of
her
sailing
away
down
through
the
cold
wintry
seas
to
search
that
lonely
coast
would
the
gray
dawn
break
with
snow
or
would
the
kindly
heavens
lend
her
some
fair
sunlight
as
she
set
forth
on
her
lonely
quest
and
all
the
night
through
she
accused
herself
of
being
hard
of
heart
and
blamed
herself
indeed
for
all
that
had
happened
in
the
time
just
as
the
day
was
coming
in
she
fell
asleep
and
she
dreamed
that
she
went
to
the
angel
whom
she
had
seen
before
and
knelt
down
at
his
feet
and
repeated
in
some
vague
way
the
promises
she
had
made
on
her
marriage
morning
with
her
head
bent
down
she
said
that
she
would
live
and
die
a
true
wife
if
only
another
chance
were
given
her
the
angel
answered
nothing
but
he
smiled
with
his
sad
eyes
and
put
his
hand
for
a
moment
on
her
head
and
then
disappeared
when
she
awoke
mairi
was
in
the
room
silently
stealing
away
the
child
and
the
white
daylight
was
clear
in
the
windows
she
dressed
with
trembling
hands
and
yet
there
was
a
faint
suffused
sense
of
joy
in
her
heart
she
wondered
if
her
father
would
keep
to
his
promise
of
the
night
before
or
whether
it
had
been
made
to
get
her
to
rest
in
any
case
she
knew
that
he
could
not
refuse
her
much
and
had
not
he
himself
said
that
he
had
intended
going
away
down
to
jura
you
are
not
looking
well
this
morning
her
father
said
is
foolish
for
you
to
lie
awake
and
think
of
such
things
and
as
for
what
you
were
saying
about
jura
how
can
you
go
to
jura
we
hef
no
boat
big
enough
for
that
i
could
go
oh
yes
could
go
but
the
boat
i
would
get
at
stornoway
you
would
not
get
in
at
all
sheila
and
as
for
the
baby
then
papa
she
said
not
the
gentleman
who
was
here
last
night
say
that
they
were
going
back
by
jura
and
it
is
a
big
yacht
and
he
has
only
two
friends
on
board
he
might
take
us
can
not
ask
a
stranger
sheila
besides
the
boat
is
too
small
a
one
for
this
time
of
the
year
i
should
not
like
to
see
you
go
in
her
have
no
fear
the
girl
said
fear
her
father
said
impatiently
of
course
you
hef
no
fear
that
is
the
mischief
you
will
take
no
care
of
yourself
is
the
young
gentleman
coming
up
this
morning
he
will
not
come
up
again
till
i
go
down
will
you
go
down
to
the
boat
sheila
and
go
on
board
of
her
sheila
assented
and
some
half
hour
thereafter
she
stood
at
the
door
clad
in
her
blue
serge
with
the
hat
and
wing
over
her
splendid
masses
of
hair
it
was
an
morning
enough
rags
of
gray
clouds
were
being
hurried
past
the
shoulders
of
suainabhal
a
heavy
surf
was
beating
on
the
shore
is
going
to
be
rain
sheila
her
father
said
smelling
the
moisture
in
the
keen
air
you
hef
your
waterproof
no
she
said
i
am
to
meet
strangers
i
can
not
wear
a
the
sharp
wind
had
brought
back
the
color
to
her
cheeks
and
there
was
some
gladness
in
her
eyes
she
knew
she
might
have
a
fight
for
it
before
she
could
persuade
her
father
to
set
sail
in
this
strange
boat
but
she
never
doubted
for
a
moment
recollecting
the
gentle
face
and
modest
manner
of
the
youthful
owner
that
he
would
be
really
glad
to
do
her
a
service
and
she
knew
that
her
opposition
would
give
way
we
take
bras
papa
no
her
father
said
will
hef
to
go
in
a
small
boat
i
hope
you
will
not
get
wet
sheila
there
is
a
good
breeze
on
the
water
this
think
they
are
much
safer
in
here
than
going
around
the
islands
just
at
present
sheila
said
you
are
right
there
sheila
her
father
said
looking
at
the
direction
of
the
wind
got
in
in
a
ferry
good
time
and
they
may
hef
to
stay
for
a
while
before
they
can
face
the
sea
we
shall
become
very
great
friends
with
them
papa
and
they
will
be
glad
to
take
us
to
jura
she
said
with
a
smile
for
she
knew
there
was
not
much
of
the
hospitality
of
borvapost
bestowed
with
ulterior
motives
they
went
down
the
steep
path
to
the
bay
where
the
phœbe
was
lurching
and
heaving
in
the
rough
swell
her
bowsprit
sometimes
nearly
catching
the
crest
of
a
wave
no
one
was
on
deck
how
were
they
to
get
on
board
hear
you
in
this
wind
sheila
said
will
have
to
haul
down
our
own
and
that
indeed
they
had
to
do
though
the
work
of
getting
the
little
thing
down
the
beach
was
not
very
arduous
for
a
man
of
build
am
going
to
pull
you
out
to
the
yacht
papa
sheila
said
you
will
do
no
such
thing
her
father
said
indignantly
if
you
wass
a
lass
and
the
gentlemen
never
wass
seeing
you
before
sit
down
in
the
stern
sheila
and
hold
on
ferry
tight
for
it
is
a
rough
water
for
this
little
they
had
almost
got
out
indeed
to
the
yacht
before
any
one
was
aware
of
their
approach
but
pate
appeared
in
time
to
seize
the
rope
that
mackenzie
flung
him
and
with
a
little
scrambling
they
were
at
last
safely
on
board
the
noise
of
their
arrival
however
startled
johnny
eyre
who
was
lying
on
his
back
smoking
a
pipe
after
breakfast
he
jumped
up
and
said
to
mosenberg
who
was
his
only
companion
this
old
gentleman
come
on
board
he
knows
you
to
be
done
said
the
boy
with
a
hesitation
and
then
a
flush
of
decision
sprang
into
his
face
him
to
come
down
yes
i
will
speak
to
him
and
tell
him
that
lavender
is
on
the
island
perhaps
he
meant
to
go
into
the
house
who
knows
if
he
did
not
let
us
make
right
said
johnny
go
a
then
he
called
up
the
companion
to
pate
to
send
the
gentleman
below
while
he
flung
a
few
things
aside
to
make
the
place
more
presentable
johnny
had
been
engaged
a
few
minutes
before
in
sewing
a
button
on
a
woolen
shirt
and
that
article
of
attire
does
not
look
well
beside
a
his
visitors
began
to
descend
the
narrow
wooden
steps
and
presently
mackenzie
was
heard
to
say
great
care
sheila
the
brass
is
ferry
thunder
johnny
said
looking
at
mosenberg
morning
eyre
said
the
old
king
of
borva
stooping
to
get
into
the
cabin
is
a
rough
day
you
are
getting
sheila
mind
your
head
till
you
have
passed
the
mackenzie
came
forward
to
shake
hands
and
in
doing
so
caught
sight
of
mosenberg
the
whole
truth
flashed
upon
him
in
a
moment
and
he
instantaneously
turned
to
sheila
and
said
quickly
go
up
on
deck
for
a
but
she
too
had
seen
the
lad
and
she
came
forward
with
a
pale
face
but
with
a
perfectly
manner
and
said
do
you
do
it
is
a
surprise
your
coming
to
the
island
but
you
often
used
to
talk
of
he
stammered
as
he
shook
hands
with
her
and
her
father
often
wished
to
come
here
what
a
wild
place
it
is
and
have
you
lived
here
mrs
lavender
all
the
time
since
you
left
london
i
mackenzie
was
getting
very
uneasy
every
moment
he
expected
lavender
would
enter
this
confined
little
cabin
and
was
this
the
place
for
these
two
to
meet
before
a
lot
of
acquaintances
he
said
is
too
close
for
you
here
and
i
am
going
to
have
a
pipe
with
the
gentlemen
now
if
you
wass
a
good
lass
you
would
go
ashore
again
and
go
up
to
the
house
and
say
to
mairi
that
we
will
all
come
for
luncheon
at
one
and
she
must
get
some
fish
up
from
borvapost
eyre
he
will
send
a
man
ashore
with
you
in
his
own
boat
that
is
bigger
than
mine
and
you
will
show
him
the
creek
to
put
into
now
go
away
like
a
good
lass
and
we
will
be
up
ferry
soon
oh
yes
we
will
be
up
directly
at
the
am
sure
sheila
said
to
johnny
eyre
can
make
you
more
comfortable
up
at
the
house
than
you
are
here
although
it
is
a
nice
little
and
then
she
turned
to
mosenberg
and
said
we
have
a
great
many
things
to
talk
she
suspect
johnny
asked
himself
as
he
escorted
her
to
the
boat
and
pulled
her
in
himself
to
the
shore
her
face
was
pale
and
her
manner
a
trifle
formal
otherwise
she
showed
no
sign
he
watched
her
go
along
the
stones
till
she
reaches
the
path
then
he
pulled
out
to
the
phœbe
again
and
went
down
below
to
entertain
his
host
of
the
previous
evening
sheila
walked
slowly
up
the
rude
little
path
taking
little
heed
of
the
blustering
wind
and
the
hurrying
clouds
her
eyes
were
bent
down
her
face
was
pale
when
she
got
to
the
top
of
the
hill
she
looked
in
a
blank
sort
of
way
all
around
the
bleak
moorland
but
probably
she
did
not
expect
to
see
any
one
there
then
she
walked
with
rather
an
uncertain
step
into
the
house
she
looked
into
the
room
the
door
of
which
stood
open
her
husband
sat
there
with
his
arms
outstretched
on
the
table
and
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
he
did
not
hear
her
approach
her
footfall
was
so
light
and
it
was
with
the
same
silent
step
she
went
into
the
room
and
knelt
down
beside
him
and
put
her
hands
and
face
on
his
knee
and
said
simply
beg
for
your
he
started
up
and
looked
at
her
as
though
she
were
some
spirit
and
his
own
face
was
haggard
and
strange
he
said
in
a
low
voice
laying
his
hand
gently
on
her
head
is
i
who
ought
to
be
there
and
you
know
it
but
i
can
not
meet
your
eyes
i
am
not
going
to
ask
for
your
forgiveness
just
yet
i
have
no
right
to
expect
it
all
i
want
is
this
if
you
will
let
me
come
and
see
you
just
as
before
we
were
married
and
if
you
will
give
me
a
chance
of
winning
your
consent
ever
again
we
can
at
least
be
friends
until
then
but
why
do
you
cry
sheila
you
have
nothing
to
reproach
yourself
she
rose
and
regarded
him
for
a
moment
with
her
streaming
eyes
and
then
moved
by
the
passionate
entreaty
of
her
face
and
forgetting
altogether
the
separation
and
time
of
trial
he
had
proposed
he
caught
her
to
his
bosom
and
kissed
her
forehead
and
talked
soothingly
and
caressingly
to
her
as
if
she
were
a
child
cry
she
said
i
am
happy
because
i
believe
all
that
time
is
over
because
i
think
you
will
be
kind
to
me
and
i
will
be
a
good
wife
to
you
and
you
will
forgive
me
all
that
i
have
are
heaping
coals
of
fire
on
my
head
sheila
he
said
humbly
know
i
have
nothing
to
forgive
as
for
you
i
tell
you
i
have
no
right
to
expect
your
forgiveness
yet
but
i
think
you
will
find
out
that
my
repentance
is
not
a
mere
momentary
thing
i
have
had
a
long
time
to
think
over
what
has
happened
and
what
i
lost
when
i
lost
you
you
have
found
me
again
the
girl
said
pale
a
little
and
glad
to
sit
down
on
the
nighest
couch
while
she
held
his
hand
and
drew
him
toward
her
now
i
must
ask
you
for
one
he
was
sitting
beside
her
he
feared
no
longer
to
meet
the
look
of
those
earnest
meek
affectionate
eyes
is
it
she
said
we
are
to
be
together
not
what
we
were
but
something
quite
different
from
that
will
you
promise
me
never
to
say
one
word
about
what
is
past
to
shut
it
out
altogether
to
forget
it
can
not
sheila
he
said
i
to
have
no
chance
of
telling
you
how
well
i
know
how
cruel
i
was
to
you
how
sorry
i
am
for
it
she
said
firmly
you
have
some
things
to
regret
so
have
i
and
what
is
the
use
of
competing
with
each
other
as
to
which
has
the
most
forgiveness
to
ask
for
frank
dear
you
will
do
this
for
me
you
will
promise
never
to
speak
one
word
about
that
time
how
earnest
the
beautiful
sad
face
was
he
could
not
withstand
the
entreaty
of
the
piteous
eyes
he
said
to
her
abashed
by
the
great
love
that
she
showed
and
hopeless
of
making
other
reparation
than
obedience
to
her
generous
wish
it
be
so
sheila
i
will
never
speak
a
word
about
it
you
will
see
otherwise
than
in
words
whether
i
forget
what
is
passed
and
your
goodness
in
letting
it
go
but
sheila
he
added
with
downcast
face
eyre
was
here
last
night
he
told
me
he
had
to
say
no
more
she
took
his
hand
and
led
him
gently
and
silently
out
of
the
room
meanwhile
the
old
king
of
borva
had
been
spending
a
somewhat
anxious
time
down
in
the
cabin
of
the
phœbe
many
and
many
a
day
had
he
been
planning
a
method
by
which
he
might
secure
a
meeting
between
sheila
and
her
husband
and
now
it
had
all
come
about
without
his
aid
and
in
a
manner
which
rendered
him
unable
to
take
any
precautions
he
did
not
know
but
that
some
awkward
accident
might
destroy
all
the
chances
of
the
affair
he
knew
that
lavender
was
on
the
island
he
had
frankly
asked
young
mosenberg
as
soon
as
sheila
had
left
the
yacht
yes
the
lad
said
went
away
into
the
island
early
this
morning
i
begged
of
him
to
go
to
your
house
he
did
not
answer
but
i
am
sure
he
will
i
know
he
kott
mackenzie
said
he
has
been
wandering
about
the
island
all
the
morning
and
he
will
be
very
faint
and
hungry
and
a
man
is
neffer
in
a
good
temper
then
for
making
up
a
quarrel
if
i
had
known
the
last
night
i
could
hef
had
dinner
with
you
all
here
and
we
should
hef
given
him
a
good
glass
of
whisky
and
then
it
wass
a
good
time
to
tek
him
up
to
the
you
may
depend
on
it
mackenzie
johnny
eyre
said
lavender
needs
no
stimulus
of
that
sort
to
make
him
desire
a
reconciliation
no
i
should
think
not
he
has
done
nothing
but
brood
over
this
affair
since
ever
he
left
london
and
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
you
scarcely
knew
him
he
is
so
altered
you
would
fancy
he
had
lived
ten
years
in
the
ay
mackenzie
said
not
listening
very
attentively
and
evidently
thinking
more
of
what
might
be
happening
elsewhere
i
was
thinking
gentlemen
it
wass
time
for
us
to
go
ashore
and
go
up
to
the
house
and
hef
something
to
thought
you
said
one
for
luncheon
sir
young
mosenberg
said
mackenzie
repeated
impatiently
the
teffle
can
wait
till
one
if
you
hef
been
walking
about
an
island
since
the
daylight
with
nothing
to
eat
or
mackenzie
forgot
that
it
was
not
lavender
he
had
asked
to
lunch
yes
he
said
hass
had
plenty
of
time
to
send
down
to
borvapost
for
some
fish
and
by
the
time
you
get
up
to
the
house
you
will
see
that
it
is
well
johnny
said
can
go
up
to
the
house
he
went
up
the
companion
and
he
had
scarcely
got
his
head
above
the
level
of
the
bulwarks
when
he
called
back
say
mackenzie
here
is
lavender
on
the
shore
and
your
daughter
is
with
him
do
they
want
to
come
on
board
do
you
think
or
do
they
want
us
to
go
ashore
mackenzie
uttered
a
few
phrases
in
gaelic
and
got
up
on
deck
instantly
there
sure
enough
was
sheila
with
her
hand
on
her
arm
both
looking
toward
the
yacht
the
wind
was
blowing
too
strong
for
them
to
call
mackenzie
wanted
himself
to
pull
in
for
them
but
this
was
overruled
and
pate
was
despatched
an
awkward
pause
ensued
the
three
standing
on
deck
were
sorely
perplexed
as
to
the
forthcoming
interview
and
as
to
what
they
should
do
were
they
to
rejoice
over
a
reconciliation
or
ignore
the
fact
altogether
and
simply
treat
sheila
as
mrs
lavender
her
father
indeed
fearing
that
sheila
would
be
strangely
excited
and
would
probably
burst
into
tears
wondered
what
he
could
get
to
scold
her
about
fortunately
an
incident
partly
ludicrous
broke
the
awkwardness
of
their
arrival
the
getting
on
deck
was
a
matter
of
some
little
difficulty
in
the
scuffle
small
hat
with
its
feather
got
unloosed
somehow
and
the
next
minute
it
was
whirled
away
by
the
wind
into
the
sea
pate
could
not
be
sent
after
it
just
at
the
moment
and
it
was
rapidly
drifting
away
to
leeward
when
johnny
eyre
with
a
laugh
and
a
goes
plunged
in
after
the
white
feather
that
was
dipping
and
rising
in
the
waves
like
a
sheila
uttered
a
slight
cry
and
caught
her
arm
but
there
was
not
much
danger
johnny
was
an
expert
swimmer
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
seen
to
be
making
his
way
backward
with
one
arm
while
in
the
other
hand
he
held
hat
then
pate
had
by
this
time
got
the
small
boat
around
to
leeward
and
very
shortly
after
johnny
dripping
like
a
newfoundland
dog
came
on
deck
and
presented
the
hat
to
sheila
amidst
a
vast
deal
of
laughter
am
so
sorry
she
said
you
must
change
your
clothes
quickly
i
hope
you
will
have
no
harm
from
i
he
said
my
beautiful
white
decks
have
got
rather
into
a
mess
i
am
glad
you
saw
them
while
they
were
dry
mrs
lavender
now
i
am
going
below
to
make
myself
a
swell
for
all
going
to
have
luncheon
on
shore
we
johnny
went
below
very
well
pleased
with
himself
he
had
called
her
mrs
lavender
without
wincing
he
had
got
over
all
the
awkwardness
of
a
second
introduction
by
the
happy
notion
of
plunging
after
the
hat
he
had
to
confess
however
that
the
temperature
of
the
sea
was
not
just
what
he
would
have
preferred
for
a
morning
bath
by
and
by
he
made
his
appearance
in
his
best
suit
of
blue
and
brass
buttons
and
asked
mrs
lavender
if
she
would
now
come
down
and
see
the
cabin
think
you
want
a
good
glass
of
whisky
old
mackenzie
said
as
they
all
went
below
water
it
is
ferry
cold
just
johnny
said
blushing
shall
all
celebrate
the
capture
of
the
it
was
the
capture
of
the
hat
then
that
was
to
be
celebrated
by
this
friendly
ceremony
perhaps
it
was
but
there
was
no
mirth
now
on
face
you
will
drink
first
sheila
her
father
said
almost
solemnly
you
will
drink
to
your
sheila
took
the
glass
of
raw
whisky
in
her
hand
and
looked
around
timidly
can
not
drink
this
papa
she
said
you
will
let
me
will
drink
that
glass
to
your
health
sheila
old
mackenzie
said
with
unusual
severity
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
if
she
like
it
johnny
eyre
cried
suddenly
not
caring
whether
it
was
the
wrath
of
old
mackenzie
or
of
the
devil
that
he
was
braving
and
forthwith
he
took
the
glass
out
of
hand
and
threw
the
whisky
on
the
floor
then
he
pulled
out
a
champagne
bottle
from
a
basket
and
said
is
what
mrs
lavender
will
mackenzie
looked
staggered
for
a
moment
he
had
never
been
so
braved
before
but
he
was
not
in
a
quarrelsome
mood
on
such
an
occasion
so
he
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
and
cried
did
ever
any
man
see
the
like
that
good
whisky
ferry
good
whisky
and
flung
on
the
floor
as
if
it
was
water
and
as
if
there
wass
no
one
in
the
boat
that
would
hef
drunk
it
but
no
matter
eyre
no
matter
the
lass
will
drink
whatever
you
give
her
for
a
good
lass
and
if
we
have
all
to
drink
champagne
that
is
no
matter
too
but
there
is
a
man
or
two
up
on
deck
that
would
not
like
to
know
the
whisky
was
johnny
said
is
still
a
drop
left
for
them
and
this
is
what
you
must
drink
lavender
had
sat
down
in
a
corner
of
the
cabin
his
eyes
averted
when
he
heard
name
mentioned
he
looked
up
and
she
came
forward
to
him
she
said
in
her
simple
way
drink
this
to
you
my
dear
husband
and
at
the
same
moment
the
old
king
of
borva
came
forward
and
held
out
his
hand
and
said
and
by
kott
i
drink
to
your
health
too
with
ferry
good
will
lavender
started
to
his
feet
a
bit
mackenzie
i
have
got
something
to
say
to
you
before
you
ought
to
shake
my
but
sheila
interposed
quickly
she
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
looked
into
his
face
will
keep
your
promise
to
me
she
said
and
that
was
an
end
of
the
matter
the
two
men
shook
hands
there
was
nothing
said
between
them
then
or
again
of
what
was
over
and
gone
they
had
a
pleasant
enough
luncheon
together
up
in
that
quaint
room
with
the
tyrolese
pictures
on
the
wall
and
duncan
for
once
respected
old
threats
as
to
what
would
happen
if
he
called
sheila
anything
but
mrs
lavender
before
these
strangers
for
some
time
lavender
sat
almost
silent
and
answered
sheila
who
continuously
talked
to
him
in
little
else
than
monosyllables
but
he
looked
at
her
a
great
deal
sometimes
in
a
wistful
sort
of
way
as
if
he
were
trying
to
recall
the
various
fancies
her
face
used
to
produce
in
his
imagination
do
you
look
at
me
so
she
said
to
him
in
an
undertone
i
have
made
a
new
friend
he
said
but
when
mackenzie
began
to
talk
of
the
wonders
of
the
island
and
the
seas
around
it
and
to
beg
the
young
yachtsmen
to
prolong
their
stay
lavender
joined
with
a
will
in
that
conversation
and
added
his
entreaties
you
are
going
to
stay
johnny
eyre
said
looking
up
yes
he
answered
as
if
the
alternative
of
going
back
with
them
had
not
presented
itself
to
him
one
thing
i
have
got
to
look
out
for
a
place
where
i
can
build
a
house
that
is
what
i
mean
to
do
with
my
savings
just
at
present
and
if
you
would
come
with
me
johnny
and
have
a
prowl
around
the
island
to
find
out
some
pretty
little
bay
with
a
good
anchorage
in
it
for
you
know
i
am
going
to
steal
that
from
mackenzie
then
we
can
begin
and
make
ourselves
architects
and
plan
out
the
place
that
is
to
be
and
then
some
day
mackenzie
had
been
sitting
in
mute
astonishment
but
he
suddenly
broke
in
upon
his
this
island
no
by
kott
you
will
not
do
that
on
this
island
and
with
all
the
people
at
stornoway
hoots
no
that
will
neffer
do
sheila
she
has
no
one
to
speak
to
on
this
island
as
a
young
lass
should
hef
and
you
what
would
you
do
yourself
in
the
bad
weather
but
there
is
stornoway
oh
yes
that
is
a
fine
big
place
and
many
people
you
will
get
to
know
there
and
you
will
hef
the
newspapers
and
the
letters
at
once
and
there
will
be
always
boats
there
that
you
can
go
to
oban
to
greenock
to
glasgow
anywhere
in
the
world
whenever
you
hef
a
mind
to
do
that
and
then
when
you
go
to
london
as
you
will
hef
to
go
many
times
there
will
be
plenty
there
to
look
after
your
house
when
it
is
shut
up
and
keep
the
rain
out
and
the
paint
and
the
paper
good
more
as
could
be
done
on
this
island
on
this
island
how
would
you
live
on
this
island
the
old
king
of
borva
spoke
quite
impatiently
and
contemptuously
of
the
place
you
would
have
thought
his
life
on
this
island
was
a
species
of
penal
servitude
and
that
he
dwelt
in
his
solitary
house
only
to
think
with
a
vain
longing
of
the
glories
and
delights
of
stornoway
lavender
knew
well
what
prompted
these
scornful
comments
on
borva
the
old
man
was
afraid
that
the
island
would
really
be
too
dull
for
sheila
and
her
husband
and
that
whereas
the
easy
compromise
of
stornoway
might
be
practicable
to
set
up
house
in
borva
might
lead
them
to
abandon
the
north
altogether
what
i
have
heard
of
it
from
lavender
johnny
said
with
a
laugh
think
this
island
such
a
dreadful
place
and
hanged
if
i
have
found
it
so
so
you
will
know
nothing
about
it
nothing
whatever
said
mackenzie
petulantly
do
not
know
the
bad
weather
when
you
can
not
go
down
the
loch
to
callernish
and
you
might
have
to
go
to
london
just
i
suppose
london
could
wait
johnny
said
mackenzie
began
to
get
angry
with
this
young
man
hef
not
been
to
stornoway
he
said
severely
i
johnny
replied
with
much
coolness
i
hanker
after
it
i
get
plenty
of
town
life
in
london
and
when
i
come
up
to
the
sea
and
the
islands
rather
pitch
my
tent
with
you
sir
than
live
in
but
you
know
johnny
how
fine
a
place
stornoway
is
lavender
said
hastily
for
he
saw
the
old
man
was
beginning
to
get
vexed
is
a
beautiful
little
town
and
it
is
on
the
sea
it
hass
fine
houses
and
ferry
many
people
and
ferry
good
society
whatever
mackenzie
added
with
some
touch
of
indignation
you
see
this
is
how
it
stands
mackenzie
lavender
put
in
humbly
should
have
to
go
to
london
from
time
to
time
and
we
should
then
get
quite
enough
of
city
life
and
you
might
find
an
occasional
trip
with
us
not
a
bad
thing
but
up
here
i
should
have
to
look
on
my
house
as
a
sort
of
workshop
now
with
all
respect
to
stornoway
you
must
admit
that
the
coast
about
here
is
a
little
more
picturesque
besides
another
thing
it
would
be
rather
more
difficult
at
stornoway
to
take
a
rod
or
a
gun
out
of
a
morning
then
there
would
be
callers
bothering
you
at
your
work
then
sheila
would
have
far
less
liberty
in
going
about
by
and
tenthly
made
up
your
mind
to
have
a
house
here
cried
johnny
eyre
with
a
loud
laugh
says
she
would
like
to
have
a
her
husband
continued
could
you
get
that
in
stornoway
you
must
have
a
large
room
for
a
piano
to
sing
in
and
play
in
the
young
jew
boy
said
looking
at
sheila
should
think
a
house
with
a
large
verandah
would
be
the
best
sort
of
thing
lavender
said
for
the
sun
and
the
rain
and
then
one
could
have
easel
outside
you
know
suppose
we
all
go
for
a
walk
around
the
shore
there
is
too
much
of
a
breeze
to
take
the
phœbe
down
the
so
the
king
of
borva
was
quietly
overruled
and
his
dominions
invaded
in
spite
of
himself
sheila
could
not
go
out
with
the
gentlemen
just
then
she
was
to
follow
in
about
an
time
meanwhile
they
buttoned
their
coats
pulled
down
their
caps
tight
and
set
out
to
face
the
grey
skies
and
the
wintry
wind
just
as
they
were
passing
away
from
the
house
mackenzie
who
was
walking
in
front
with
lavender
said
in
a
cautious
sort
of
way
will
want
a
deal
of
money
to
build
this
house
you
wass
speaking
about
for
it
will
hef
to
be
all
stone
and
iron
and
very
strong
whatever
or
else
it
will
be
a
plague
to
you
from
the
one
year
to
the
next
with
the
rain
getting
yes
lavender
said
will
have
to
be
done
well
once
for
all
and
what
with
rooms
big
enough
to
paint
in
and
play
billiards
in
and
also
a
bedroom
or
two
for
friends
who
may
come
to
stay
with
us
it
will
be
an
expensive
business
but
i
have
been
very
lucky
mackenzie
it
the
money
i
have
but
the
commissions
i
am
offered
that
warrant
my
going
in
for
this
house
tell
you
about
all
these
things
afterward
in
the
meantime
i
shall
have
hundred
pounds
or
thereabouts
in
a
couple
of
you
hef
more
than
that
now
mackenzie
said
gravely
is
what
i
wass
going
to
tell
you
the
money
that
your
aunt
left
that
is
yours
every
penny
of
it
oh
yes
every
penny
and
every
farthing
of
it
is
yours
sure
enough
for
it
wass
ingram
hass
told
me
all
about
it
and
the
old
lady
she
wanted
him
to
take
care
of
the
money
for
sheila
but
what
wass
the
good
of
the
money
to
sheila
my
lass
she
will
hef
plenty
of
money
of
her
own
and
i
wanted
her
to
hef
nothing
to
do
with
what
ingram
said
but
it
wass
all
no
use
and
there
iss
the
money
now
for
you
and
for
sheila
every
penny
and
every
farthing
of
mackenzie
ended
by
talking
in
an
injured
way
as
if
this
business
had
seriously
increased
his
troubles
you
know
lavender
said
with
amazement
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
this
money
was
definitely
left
to
ingram
and
you
may
believe
me
or
not
i
was
precious
glad
of
it
when
i
heard
it
of
course
it
would
have
been
of
more
use
to
him
if
he
had
not
been
about
to
marry
this
american
you
hef
heard
that
then
mackenzie
said
brought
me
the
news
but
are
you
quite
sure
about
this
affair
you
think
this
is
merely
a
trick
of
to
enable
him
to
give
the
money
to
sheila
that
would
be
very
like
him
i
know
him
of
i
can
not
help
it
if
a
man
will
tell
lies
said
mackenzie
that
is
what
he
says
is
true
and
he
will
not
touch
the
money
indeed
he
will
hef
plenty
as
you
say
but
there
it
is
for
sheila
and
you
and
you
will
be
able
to
build
whatever
house
you
like
and
if
you
was
thinking
of
having
a
bigger
boat
than
the
the
old
man
suggested
lavender
jumped
at
that
notion
directly
if
we
could
get
a
yacht
big
enough
to
cruise
anywhere
in
the
summer
months
he
said
might
bring
a
party
of
people
all
the
way
from
the
thames
to
loch
roag
and
cast
anchor
opposite
house
fancy
ingram
and
his
wife
coming
up
like
that
in
the
autumn
and
i
know
you
could
go
over
to
sir
james
and
get
us
some
mackenzie
laughed
grimly
will
see
we
will
see
about
that
i
think
there
will
be
no
great
difficulty
about
getting
a
deer
or
two
for
you
and
as
for
the
salmon
there
will
be
one
or
two
left
in
the
white
water
oh
yes
we
will
have
a
little
shooting
and
a
little
fishing
for
any
of
your
friends
and
as
for
the
boat
it
will
be
ferry
difficult
to
get
a
good
big
boat
for
such
a
purpose
without
you
was
planning
and
building
one
yourself
and
that
will
be
better
i
think
for
the
yachts
nowadays
they
are
all
built
for
the
racing
and
you
will
have
a
beat
fifty
tons
sixty
tons
seventy
tons
that
hass
no
room
in
her
below
but
is
nothing
but
a
big
heap
of
canvas
and
spars
but
if
you
was
wanting
a
good
steady
boat
with
good
cabins
below
for
the
leddies
and
a
good
saloon
that
you
could
have
your
dinner
in
all
at
once
then
you
will
maybe
come
down
with
me
to
a
shipbuilder
i
know
in
glasgow
oh
he
is
a
ferry
good
man
and
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
there
is
a
gentleman
now
in
dunoon
and
they
say
he
is
a
ferry
great
artist
too
and
he
hass
a
schooner
of
sixty
tons
that
i
hef
been
in
myself
and
it
wass
just
like
a
steamer
below
for
the
comfort
of
it
and
when
the
boat
is
ready
i
will
get
you
ferry
good
sailors
for
her
that
will
know
every
bit
of
the
coast
from
loch
indaal
to
the
butt
of
lewis
and
i
will
see
that
they
are
ferry
cheap
for
you
for
i
hef
plenty
of
work
for
them
in
the
winter
but
i
was
no
saying
yet
the
old
man
added
you
were
right
about
coming
to
live
in
borva
stornoway
is
a
good
place
to
live
in
and
it
is
a
fine
harbor
for
repairs
if
the
boat
was
wanting
she
were
we
send
her
around
to
stornoway
the
people
in
stornoway
it
iss
the
people
in
stornoway
said
mackenzie
who
was
not
going
to
give
in
without
a
grumble
well
they
did
not
fix
on
a
site
for
the
house
that
afternoon
sheila
did
not
make
her
appearance
lavender
kept
continually
turning
and
looking
over
the
long
undulations
of
rock
and
moorland
and
at
length
he
said
here
johnny
would
you
mind
going
on
by
yourselves
i
think
i
shall
walk
back
to
the
is
keeping
that
foolish
girl
her
father
said
impatiently
is
something
about
the
dinner
now
as
if
any
one
was
particular
about
a
dinner
in
an
island
like
this
where
you
can
expect
nothing
but
at
stornoway
oh
yes
they
hef
many
things
i
want
you
to
come
and
dine
with
us
on
board
the
phœbe
sir
johnny
said
will
be
rather
a
lark
mind
you
we
make
up
a
tight
fit
in
that
cabin
i
wonder
if
mrs
lavender
would
venture
do
you
think
she
would
sir
no
not
this
evening
anyway
said
her
father
i
know
she
will
expect
you
all
to
be
up
at
the
house
this
evening
and
what
would
be
the
use
of
tumbling
about
in
the
bay
when
you
can
be
in
a
house
but
it
is
very
kind
of
you
oh
yes
night
then
we
will
go
down
to
the
boat
but
this
night
i
know
sheila
will
be
ferry
sorry
if
you
do
not
come
to
the
go
back
now
johnny
said
if
time
we
might
go
down
for
our
guns
and
have
a
try
along
the
shore
for
an
hour
or
so
before
the
daylight
goes
fancy
that
chance
at
those
wild
duck
but
that
is
nothing
mackenzie
said
you
will
come
with
me
up
to
the
loch
and
there
you
will
hef
some
shooting
and
in
many
other
places
i
will
show
you
you
will
hef
plenty
of
they
had
just
got
back
to
the
house
when
they
found
sheila
coming
out
she
had
as
her
father
supposed
been
detained
by
her
preparations
for
entertaining
their
guests
but
now
she
was
free
until
and
so
the
whole
party
went
down
to
the
shore
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
phœbe
and
let
mackenzie
have
a
look
at
the
guns
on
board
then
they
went
up
to
the
house
and
found
the
tall
and
grim
keeper
with
the
baby
in
his
arms
while
scarlett
and
mairi
were
putting
the
finishing
touches
on
the
gleaming
white
table
and
its
show
of
steel
and
crystal
how
strange
it
was
to
sheila
to
sit
at
dinner
there
and
listen
to
her
husband
talking
of
boating
and
fishing
and
what
not
as
he
used
to
sit
and
talk
in
the
olden
time
to
her
father
on
the
summer
evenings
on
the
high
rocks
over
borvapost
the
interval
between
that
time
and
this
seemed
to
go
clean
out
of
her
mind
and
yet
there
must
have
been
some
interval
for
he
was
looking
older
and
sterner
and
much
rougher
about
the
face
now
after
being
buffeted
about
by
wind
and
rain
and
sun
during
that
long
and
solitary
stay
in
jura
but
it
was
very
like
the
old
times
when
they
went
into
the
little
and
when
mairi
brought
in
the
hot
water
and
the
whisky
the
tobacco
and
the
long
pipes
when
the
old
king
of
borva
sat
himself
down
in
his
great
chair
by
the
table
and
when
lavender
came
to
sheila
and
asked
her
if
he
should
get
out
her
music
and
open
the
piano
for
her
young
mosenberg
said
to
her
is
a
long
time
since
i
heard
one
of
your
strange
gaelic
you
never
heard
this
one
sheila
said
and
she
began
to
sing
the
plaintive
to
many
a
time
indeed
of
late
had
she
sung
its
simple
and
pathetic
air
as
a
sort
of
lullaby
perhaps
because
it
was
gentle
monotonous
and
melancholy
perhaps
because
there
were
lines
here
and
there
that
she
liked
many
a
time
had
she
sung
sleep
sound
my
sweet
babe
there
is
naught
to
alarm
thee
the
sons
of
the
valley
no
power
have
to
harm
thee
sing
thee
to
rest
in
the
balloch
untrodden
with
a
coronach
sad
for
the
slain
of
culloden
but
long
before
she
had
reached
the
end
of
it
her
patience
gave
way
and
he
said
we
will
hef
no
more
of
those
teffles
of
songs
we
will
hef
a
good
song
and
there
is
more
than
one
of
the
gentlemen
can
sing
a
good
song
and
we
do
not
wish
to
be
always
crying
over
the
sorrows
of
other
people
now
be
a
good
lass
sheila
and
sing
us
a
good
cheerful
and
sheila
with
great
good
nature
suddenly
struck
a
different
key
and
sang
with
a
spirit
that
delighted
the
old
man
the
standard
on
the
braes
mar
is
up
and
streaming
rarely
the
gathering
pipe
on
lochnagar
is
sounding
lang
and
clearly
the
highlandmen
from
hill
and
glen
in
martial
hue
with
bonnets
blue
belted
plaids
and
burnished
blades
are
coming
late
and
early
that
is
a
better
kind
of
song
that
is
a
teffle
of
a
good
song
mackenzie
cried
keeping
time
to
the
music
with
his
right
foot
as
if
he
were
a
piper
playing
in
front
of
his
regiment
there
anything
like
that
in
your
country
mosenberg
know
sir
said
the
lad
meekly
if
you
like
i
will
sing
you
one
of
our
songs
they
have
plenty
of
fire
in
them
i
certainly
mackenzie
had
plenty
of
brilliant
and
cheerful
and
stirring
music
that
evening
but
that
which
pleased
him
most
doubtless
was
to
see
as
all
the
world
could
see
the
happiness
of
his
good
lass
sheila
proud
and
glad
with
a
light
on
her
face
that
had
not
been
there
for
many
a
day
wanted
to
do
everything
at
once
to
please
and
amuse
her
guests
and
most
of
all
to
wait
upon
her
husband
and
lavender
was
so
abashed
by
her
sweet
service
and
her
simple
ways
that
he
could
show
his
gratitude
only
by
some
furtive
and
kindly
touch
of
the
hand
as
sheila
passed
it
seemed
to
him
she
had
never
looked
so
beautiful
and
never
indeed
since
they
left
stornoway
together
had
he
heard
her
quiet
low
laugh
so
full
of
enjoyment
what
had
he
done
he
asked
himself
to
deserve
her
confidence
for
it
was
the
hope
in
her
proud
and
gentle
eyes
that
gave
that
radiant
brightness
to
her
face
he
did
not
know
he
could
not
answer
perhaps
the
foregiveness
she
had
so
freely
and
frankly
tendered
and
the
confidence
she
now
so
clearly
showed
in
him
sprang
from
no
judgment
or
argument
but
were
only
the
natural
fruit
of
an
abounding
and
generous
love
more
than
once
that
night
he
wished
that
sheila
could
read
the
next
years
as
though
in
some
prophetic
scroll
that
he
might
show
her
how
he
would
endeavor
to
prove
himself
if
not
unworthy
for
he
could
scarcely
hope
that
at
least
conscious
of
her
great
and
unselfish
affection
and
as
grateful
for
it
as
a
man
could
be
they
pushed
their
enjoyment
to
such
a
late
hour
of
the
night
that
when
they
discovered
what
time
it
was
mackenzie
would
not
allow
one
of
them
to
venture
out
into
the
dark
to
find
the
path
down
to
the
yacht
and
duncan
and
scarlett
were
forthwith
called
on
to
provide
the
belated
guests
with
some
more
or
less
haphazard
sleeping
accommodation
mackenzie
said
johnny
mind
a
bit
if
i
sleep
on
the
floor
just
had
the
jolliest
night
i
ever
spent
in
my
life
mosenberg
have
to
take
the
phœbe
back
to
greenock
by
yourself
i
shall
never
leave
borva
any
will
be
sober
in
the
morning
eyre
young
mosenberg
said
but
the
remark
was
unjust
for
enthusiasm
had
not
been
produced
by
the
old
whisky
potent
as
that
was
chapter
xxvii
the
princess
sheila
should
like
said
edward
ingram
sitting
down
and
contentedly
folding
her
hands
in
her
lap
i
should
so
much
like
edward
to
have
my
own
way
for
once
it
would
be
so
novel
and
so
her
husband
was
busy
with
a
whole
lot
of
plans
all
stretched
out
before
him
and
with
a
pipe
which
he
had
some
difficulty
in
keeping
alight
he
did
not
even
turn
around
as
he
answered
have
your
own
way
always
but
you
expect
to
have
mine
also
you
you
remember
she
said
slowly
your
friend
sheila
told
you
about
your
rudeness
to
people
i
wish
edward
you
would
leave
those
ragged
children
and
their
for
three
minutes
do
i
so
much
want
to
see
some
places
when
we
go
to
scotland
for
who
knows
when
we
may
be
there
again
i
have
set
my
heart
on
the
braes
of
yarrow
and
loch
awe
by
moonlight
and
the
pass
of
glencoe
dear
child
he
said
at
last
turning
around
in
his
chair
can
we
go
to
those
places
sheila
says
oban
on
the
what
sheila
says
an
act
of
parliament
said
the
young
american
lady
plaintively
and
patiently
should
you
regulate
all
your
movements
by
her
you
are
always
looking
to
the
north
you
are
like
the
spires
of
the
churches
that
are
said
to
be
always
telling
us
that
heaven
is
close
by
the
pole
information
is
inaccurate
my
dear
ingram
said
looking
at
his
pipe
the
spires
of
the
churches
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
point
the
other
way
however
that
does
not
matter
how
do
you
propose
to
go
rampaging
all
over
scotland
and
still
be
at
oban
on
the
fifteenth
to
and
mrs
lavender
to
come
on
to
edinburgh
and
leave
the
trip
to
lewis
until
we
have
seen
those
places
for
once
we
have
got
to
that
wild
island
who
knows
when
we
shall
return
now
do
like
a
good
boy
you
know
this
new
house
of
theirs
will
be
all
the
drier
in
a
time
and
their
yacht
will
be
all
the
more
and
both
sheila
and
her
husband
will
be
the
better
for
coming
down
among
civilized
folks
for
a
time
especially
just
now
when
numbers
of
their
friends
must
be
in
the
highlands
and
of
course
you
get
better
attention
at
the
hotels
when
the
season
is
going
on
and
they
have
every
preparation
made
and
i
am
told
the
heather
and
fern
on
the
hills
look
very
fine
in
august
and
i
am
sure
and
mrs
lavender
will
enjoy
it
very
much
if
we
get
a
carriage
somewhere
and
leave
the
railways
altogether
and
drive
by
ourselves
all
through
the
prettiest
she
wished
to
see
the
effect
of
her
eloquence
on
him
it
was
peculiar
he
put
his
pipe
down
and
gravely
repeated
these
lines
with
which
she
was
abundantly
familiar
vather
to
i
rin
arter
him
du
sez
i
to
vather
darned
if
i
du
she
said
proposal
comes
too
late
how
can
you
expect
sheila
to
leave
her
new
house
and
that
boy
of
hers
that
occupies
of
her
letters
just
at
this
time
i
think
it
was
very
kind
of
her
mind
you
to
come
away
down
to
oban
to
meet
us
and
lavender
too
is
giving
up
the
time
out
of
the
best
working
season
of
the
year
bless
you
you
will
see
far
more
beautiful
things
as
we
go
from
oban
to
lewis
than
any
you
have
mentioned
for
we
shall
probably
cut
down
by
scarba
and
jura
before
going
up
to
skye
and
then
you
will
see
the
coast
that
you
admired
so
much
in
the
yacht
a
large
one
edward
his
wife
asked
somewhat
timidly
big
enough
to
take
our
party
a
dozen
times
she
tumble
about
much
do
you
think
know
ingram
said
with
an
unkindly
grin
as
you
are
a
weak
vessel
lavender
will
watch
the
weather
for
you
and
give
it
you
as
smooth
as
possible
besides
look
at
the
cleanliness
and
comfort
of
a
smart
yacht
you
are
thinking
of
one
of
those
channel
steamers
with
their
engines
and
us
hope
for
the
best
said
his
wife
with
a
sigh
they
not
only
hoped
for
it
but
got
it
when
they
left
the
crinan
and
got
on
board
the
big
steamer
that
was
to
take
them
up
to
oban
all
around
them
lay
a
sea
of
soft
and
shining
blue
scarcely
marred
by
a
ripple
here
and
there
sharp
crags
that
rose
out
of
the
luminous
plain
seemed
almost
black
but
the
farther
islands
lay
soft
and
hazy
in
the
heat
with
the
beautiful
colors
of
august
tinting
the
great
masses
of
rock
as
they
steamed
northward
through
the
shining
sea
new
islands
and
new
channels
appeared
until
they
came
in
sight
of
the
open
atlantic
and
that
too
was
as
calm
and
as
still
as
a
summer
night
there
was
no
white
cloud
in
the
blue
vault
of
the
sky
there
was
no
crisp
curl
of
a
wave
on
the
blue
plain
of
the
sea
but
everywhere
a
clear
radiant
atmosphere
the
drowsy
haze
of
which
was
only
visible
when
you
looked
at
the
distant
islands
and
saw
the
fine
and
pearly
vail
of
heat
that
was
drawn
over
the
soft
colors
of
the
hills
the
dipped
and
disappeared
as
the
big
boat
churned
its
way
onward
a
white
solan
far
away
by
the
shores
of
mull
struck
the
water
as
he
dived
and
sent
a
jet
of
spray
into
the
air
colonsay
and
oronsay
became
as
faint
clouds
on
the
southern
horizon
the
jagged
coast
of
lorne
drew
near
and
then
they
went
up
through
the
sound
of
kerrara
and
steamed
into
the
broad
and
beautiful
bay
of
oban
and
behold
here
was
sheila
on
the
pier
already
waving
a
handkerchief
to
them
while
her
husband
held
her
arm
lest
in
her
excitement
she
should
go
too
near
the
edge
of
the
quay
where
is
the
boat
that
we
have
heard
so
much
of
said
kavanagh
when
all
the
kissing
and
handshaking
was
over
said
sheila
not
without
some
shamefaced
pride
pointing
to
a
shapely
schooner
that
lay
out
in
the
bay
with
her
white
decks
and
tall
spars
shining
in
the
afternoon
sun
what
do
you
call
her
asked
daughter
call
her
said
lavender
do
you
think
of
the
name
have
got
a
better
ingram
said
sententiously
and
interposing
as
if
it
was
not
within
his
province
to
form
an
opinion
of
any
sort
where
is
your
father
sheila
in
borva
no
he
is
here
the
girl
said
with
a
smile
the
truth
is
he
has
driven
away
to
see
some
gentlemen
he
knows
to
ask
if
he
can
have
some
grouse
for
you
he
should
have
been
back
by
this
would
not
hurry
him
sheila
ingram
said
gravely
could
not
have
gone
on
a
more
admirable
errand
we
must
await
his
return
with
composure
in
the
meantime
lavender
do
make
your
fellows
stop
that
man
he
is
taking
away
my
trunk
to
some
hotel
or
the
business
of
getting
the
luggage
on
board
the
yacht
was
entrusted
to
a
couple
of
men
whom
lavender
left
on
shore
whereupon
the
travelers
put
off
in
a
little
pinnace
and
were
conveyed
to
the
side
of
the
handsome
schooner
when
they
were
on
board
an
eager
exploration
followed
and
if
sheila
could
only
have
undertaken
to
vouch
for
the
smoothness
of
the
water
for
the
next
month
ingram
was
ready
to
declare
that
at
last
she
had
discovered
the
most
charming
and
beautiful
and
picturesque
fashion
of
living
known
to
civilized
man
she
was
delighted
with
the
little
elegancies
of
the
she
was
delighted
with
the
paintings
on
the
under
skylights
which
had
been
done
by
own
hand
she
was
delighted
with
the
whiteness
of
the
decks
and
the
height
of
the
tapering
spars
and
she
had
no
words
for
her
admiration
of
the
beautiful
sweep
of
the
bay
the
striking
ruins
of
the
old
castle
at
the
point
the
rugged
hills
rising
behind
the
white
houses
and
out
there
in
the
west
the
noble
panorama
of
mountain
and
island
and
sea
am
afraid
ingram
lavender
said
will
have
cause
to
know
oban
before
we
leave
it
there
is
not
a
breath
of
wind
to
take
us
out
of
the
am
content
she
said
a
gracious
we
must
get
you
up
to
borva
somehow
there
it
would
not
matter
how
long
you
were
becalmed
for
there
is
plenty
to
see
about
the
island
but
this
is
a
trifle
commonplace
you
think
so
at
all
i
am
delighted
with
the
place
she
said
so
are
you
ingram
laughed
he
knew
she
was
daring
him
to
contradict
her
he
proposed
he
should
go
ashore
and
buy
a
few
lines
with
which
they
might
fish
for
young
saithe
or
lythe
over
the
side
of
the
yacht
but
this
project
was
stopped
by
the
appearance
of
the
king
of
borva
who
bore
triumphant
proof
of
the
success
of
his
mission
in
a
brace
of
grouse
held
up
in
each
hand
as
a
small
boat
brought
him
out
to
the
yacht
i
was
seeing
hutcheson
mackenzie
said
to
lavender
as
he
stepped
on
board
he
is
a
ferry
man
whatever
and
he
says
if
there
is
no
wind
at
all
he
will
let
one
of
his
steamers
take
the
yacht
up
to
loch
sunart
and
if
there
is
a
breeze
at
all
we
will
get
it
why
should
we
go
in
quest
of
a
breeze
ingram
said
petulantly
mem
said
mackenzie
taking
the
matter
seriously
was
not
thinking
we
could
sail
a
boat
without
wind
but
i
am
no
sure
that
there
will
not
be
a
breeze
before
mackenzie
was
right
as
the
evening
wore
on
and
the
sun
drooped
in
the
west
the
aspect
of
affairs
changed
somewhat
and
there
was
now
and
again
a
sort
of
shiver
apparent
on
the
surface
of
the
bay
when
indeed
the
people
on
board
came
up
on
deck
just
before
dinner
they
found
a
rather
sunset
spreading
over
the
sky
into
the
clear
saffron
glory
of
the
western
sky
some
dark
and
massive
purple
clouds
had
risen
the
mountains
of
mull
had
grown
light
and
and
yet
they
seemed
near
the
bay
began
to
move
and
the
black
shadow
of
a
ship
that
lay
on
the
gleaming
yellow
plain
began
to
tremble
as
the
water
cut
lines
of
light
across
the
reflection
of
the
masts
you
could
hear
voices
afar
off
under
the
ruins
of
the
castle
and
along
the
curves
of
the
coast
the
shadows
of
the
water
were
a
pure
green
and
the
rocks
were
growing
still
more
sharp
and
distinct
in
the
gathering
dusk
there
was
a
cold
smell
of
the
sea
in
the
air
and
then
swiftly
the
pale
colors
of
the
west
waxed
lurid
and
fierce
the
mountains
became
of
a
glowing
purple
and
then
all
the
plain
of
the
sea
was
dashed
with
a
wild
glare
of
crimson
while
the
walls
of
dunolly
grew
black
and
overhead
the
first
scouts
of
the
marshaling
forces
of
the
clouds
came
up
in
flying
shreds
of
gold
and
fire
ay
we
may
hef
a
breeze
the
night
mackenzie
said
hope
we
have
a
storm
ingram
said
storm
oh
no
no
storm
at
all
it
will
be
a
ferry
good
thing
if
the
wind
lasts
till
the
mackenzie
was
not
at
all
sure
that
there
would
be
storm
enough
and
went
down
to
dinner
grumbling
over
the
fineness
of
the
weather
indeed
when
they
came
on
deck
again
later
on
in
the
night
even
the
slight
breeze
that
he
had
hoped
for
seemed
impossible
the
night
was
perfectly
still
a
few
stars
had
come
out
overhead
and
their
light
scarcely
trembled
on
the
smooth
waters
of
the
bay
a
cold
fresh
scent
of
seaweed
was
about
but
no
wind
the
orange
lights
in
oban
burned
pale
and
clear
the
red
and
green
lamps
of
the
steamers
and
yachts
in
the
bay
did
not
move
and
when
ingram
came
up
to
take
sheila
forward
to
the
bow
of
the
boat
to
sit
down
there
to
have
a
confidential
talk
with
her
a
clear
and
golden
moon
was
rising
over
the
sharp
black
ridge
of
kerrara
into
the
still
and
beautiful
skies
and
there
was
not
a
ripple
of
the
water
along
the
sides
of
the
yacht
to
break
the
wonderful
silence
of
the
night
dear
she
said
have
a
beautiful
place
to
live
we
do
not
live
here
sheila
said
with
a
smile
is
to
me
as
far
away
from
home
as
england
can
be
to
you
when
you
think
of
america
when
i
came
here
for
the
first
time
i
thought
i
had
got
into
another
world
and
that
i
should
never
be
able
to
get
back
again
to
the
is
the
island
you
live
in
more
beautiful
than
this
place
she
asked
looking
around
on
the
calm
sea
the
lambent
skies
and
the
far
mountains
beyond
which
were
gray
and
in
the
pale
glow
of
the
moon
you
see
our
island
on
such
a
night
as
this
you
will
say
it
is
the
most
beautiful
place
in
the
world
it
is
the
that
is
bad
when
we
have
rain
and
mist
for
weeks
together
but
after
this
year
i
think
we
shall
spend
all
the
winters
in
london
although
my
husband
does
not
like
to
give
up
the
shooting
and
boating
and
that
is
very
good
amusement
for
him
when
he
is
tired
with
his
island
life
certainly
seems
to
agree
with
him
said
ingram
not
daring
even
to
hint
that
there
was
any
further
improvement
in
husband
than
that
of
mere
health
have
never
seen
him
look
so
well
and
strong
i
scarcely
recognized
him
on
the
pier
he
was
so
brown
and
and
and
i
think
his
sailor
clothes
suit
him
so
well
they
are
a
little
rough
you
know
indeed
i
have
been
wondering
whether
you
made
them
sheila
laughed
have
seen
you
look
at
them
no
i
did
not
make
them
but
the
cloth
that
was
made
on
the
island
and
it
is
very
good
cloth
see
what
a
bad
imitation
of
your
costume
i
am
compelled
to
wear
edward
would
have
it
you
know
i
think
like
me
to
speak
like
you
if
i
could
manage
no
i
am
sure
he
would
not
like
that
sheila
said
many
a
time
he
used
to
correct
me
and
when
he
first
came
to
the
island
i
was
very
much
ashamed
and
sometimes
angry
with
i
suppose
you
got
accustomed
to
his
putting
everybody
right
said
wife
with
a
smile
was
always
a
very
good
friend
to
me
sheila
said
simply
and
i
think
he
is
now
said
her
companion
taking
the
hand
and
forcing
herself
to
say
something
of
that
which
lay
at
her
heart
and
which
had
been
struggling
for
utterance
during
all
this
beating
about
the
bush
am
sure
you
could
not
have
a
better
friend
than
he
is
and
if
you
only
knew
how
pleased
we
both
are
to
find
you
so
well
and
so
happy
sheila
saw
the
great
embarrassment
in
her
face
and
she
knew
the
good
feeling
that
had
driven
her
to
this
stammering
confession
is
very
kind
of
you
she
said
gently
am
very
happy
yes
i
do
not
think
i
have
anything
more
to
wish
for
in
the
there
was
no
embarrassment
in
her
manner
as
she
made
this
simple
avowal
her
face
was
clear
and
calm
in
the
moonlight
and
her
eyes
were
looking
somewhat
distantly
at
the
sea
and
the
island
near
her
husband
came
forward
with
a
light
shawl
and
put
it
around
her
shoulders
she
took
his
hand
and
for
a
moment
pressed
it
to
her
lips
then
he
went
back
to
where
ingram
and
old
mackenzie
were
smoking
and
the
two
women
were
left
to
their
confidences
kavanagh
had
gone
below
what
was
this
great
noise
next
morning
of
the
rattling
of
chains
and
the
flapping
of
canvas
overhead
there
was
a
slight
motion
in
the
boat
and
a
plashing
of
water
around
her
sides
was
the
getting
under
weigh
the
various
noises
ceased
so
also
did
the
rolling
of
the
vessel
and
apparently
all
was
silent
and
motionless
again
but
when
the
ladies
had
dressed
and
got
up
on
deck
behold
they
were
in
a
new
world
all
around
them
were
the
blue
waters
of
loch
linnhe
lit
up
by
the
brilliant
sunshine
of
the
morning
a
light
breeze
was
just
filling
the
great
white
sails
and
the
yacht
heeling
over
slightly
was
cutting
her
placid
way
through
the
lapping
waves
how
keen
was
the
fresh
smell
of
the
air
were
swooping
down
and
around
the
tall
masts
over
there
the
green
island
of
lismore
lay
bright
in
the
sunshine
the
lonely
hills
of
morven
and
the
mountains
of
mull
had
a
thousand
shades
of
color
growing
on
their
massive
shoulders
and
slopes
the
ruins
of
duart
castle
out
at
the
point
seemed
too
fair
and
picturesque
to
be
associated
with
dark
legends
of
blood
were
these
faint
specks
in
the
south
the
far
islands
of
colonsay
and
oronsay
lavender
brought
his
glass
to
ingram
and
with
many
apologies
to
all
the
ladies
for
having
woke
them
up
so
soon
bade
her
watch
the
flight
of
two
herons
making
in
for
the
mouth
of
loch
etive
they
had
postponed
for
the
present
that
southward
trip
to
jura
the
glass
was
still
rising
and
the
appearance
of
the
weather
rendered
it
doubtful
whether
they
might
have
wind
enough
to
make
such
a
cruise
anything
but
tedious
they
had
taken
advantage
of
the
light
breeze
in
the
morning
to
weigh
anchor
and
stand
across
for
the
sound
of
mull
if
it
held
out
they
would
at
least
reach
tobermony
and
take
their
last
look
at
a
town
before
rounding
ardnamurchan
and
making
for
the
wild
solitudes
of
skye
cis
ingram
said
to
his
wife
as
he
busied
himself
with
a
certain
long
do
you
think
of
the
western
highlands
did
you
not
tell
me
of
these
places
before
she
said
rather
absently
for
the
mere
height
of
the
mountains
along
the
sound
of
mull
the
soft
green
woods
leading
up
to
the
great
bare
shoulders
of
purple
and
gray
and
brown
above
seemed
to
draw
away
eyes
and
thoughts
from
surrounding
objects
have
often
but
what
is
the
use
of
telling
is
the
most
wonderful
place
i
have
ever
seen
she
said
is
so
beautiful
and
so
desolate
at
the
same
time
what
lovely
colors
there
are
everywhere
on
the
sea
and
on
the
shores
there
and
up
the
hills
and
everything
is
so
bright
and
gleaming
but
no
one
seems
to
live
here
i
suppose
you
the
loneliness
of
the
mountains
and
the
sea
would
kill
dear
child
these
are
fancies
he
said
in
his
usual
calm
and
carelessly
sententious
manner
you
lived
there
you
would
have
plenty
to
do
besides
looking
at
the
hills
and
the
sea
you
would
be
glad
of
a
fine
day
to
let
you
go
out
and
get
some
fish
or
go
up
the
hills
and
get
some
blackcock
for
your
dinner
and
you
would
not
get
sad
by
looking
at
fine
colors
as
do
do
you
think
lavender
and
sheila
spend
their
time
in
mooning
up
in
that
island
of
theirs
and
that
i
can
tell
you
is
a
trifle
more
remote
and
wild
than
this
is
got
their
work
to
do
and
when
that
is
done
they
feel
comfortable
and
secure
in
a
house
and
fairly
pleased
with
themselves
that
they
have
earned
some
rest
and
amusement
i
dare
say
if
you
built
a
cottage
over
there
and
did
nothing
but
look
at
the
sea
and
the
hills
and
the
sky
at
night
you
would
very
soon
drown
yourself
i
suppose
if
a
man
were
to
give
himself
up
for
three
months
to
thinking
of
the
first
formation
of
the
world
and
the
condition
of
affairs
before
that
happened
and
the
puzzle
about
how
the
materials
ever
came
to
be
there
he
would
grow
mad
but
few
people
luckily
have
the
chance
of
trying
got
their
bread
to
earn
if
they
bent
on
killing
something
or
other
foxes
grouse
deer
and
what
not
and
they
bother
about
the
stars
or
what
lies
just
outside
the
region
of
the
stars
when
i
find
myself
getting
miserable
about
the
size
of
a
mountain
or
the
question
as
to
how
and
when
it
came
there
i
know
that
it
is
time
to
eat
something
i
think
breakfast
is
ready
cis
do
you
think
you
have
the
nerve
to
cut
this
hook
out
of
my
fingers
and
then
we
can
go
she
gave
a
little
scream
and
started
up
two
drops
of
blood
had
fallen
on
white
decks
i
see
you
he
said
this
knife
and
i
will
dig
it
out
myself
bless
the
girl
are
you
going
to
faint
because
i
have
scratched
my
finger
lavender
however
had
to
be
called
in
to
help
and
while
the
surgical
operation
was
going
forward
ingram
said
see
we
have
got
hands
as
yet
i
suppose
they
will
get
to
be
leather
by
and
by
i
am
sure
i
know
how
mrs
lavender
can
do
those
things
about
a
boat
with
the
tiny
little
hands
she
sheila
has
small
hands
she
lavender
said
as
he
bound
up
his
finger
then
she
makes
up
for
that
by
the
bigness
of
her
it
was
a
pretty
and
kindly
speech
and
it
pleased
mrs
ingram
though
sheila
did
not
hear
it
then
when
the
doctoring
was
over
they
all
went
below
for
breakfast
and
an
odor
of
fish
and
ham
and
eggs
and
coffee
prevailed
throughout
the
yacht
have
quite
fallen
in
love
with
this
manner
of
life
ingram
said
tell
me
is
it
always
as
pleasant
as
this
do
you
always
have
those
blue
seas
around
you
and
green
shores
are
the
sails
always
white
in
the
sunlight
there
was
a
dead
silence
i
would
not
say
mackenzie
observed
seriously
as
no
one
else
would
take
up
the
question
i
would
not
say
it
is
always
ferry
good
weather
off
this
coast
oh
no
i
would
not
say
that
for
if
there
was
no
rain
what
would
the
cattle
do
and
the
streams
they
would
not
hef
a
pool
left
in
them
oh
yes
there
is
rain
sometimes
but
you
can
not
always
be
sailing
about
and
when
there
will
be
rain
you
will
hef
your
things
to
attend
to
and
there
is
always
plenty
of
good
weather
if
you
wass
wanting
to
tek
a
trip
around
the
islands
or
down
to
oban
oh
yes
there
is
no
fear
of
that
and
it
will
be
a
ferry
good
coast
whatever
for
the
harbor
and
there
is
always
some
place
you
can
put
into
if
it
wass
coming
on
rough
only
you
must
know
the
coast
and
the
lie
of
the
islands
and
the
rocks
about
the
harbors
and
you
would
learn
it
ferry
soon
there
is
sheila
there
there
is
no
one
in
the
lewis
will
know
more
of
the
channels
in
loch
roag
than
she
does
not
one
i
can
say
that
and
when
you
go
farther
away
then
you
must
tek
some
one
with
you
who
wass
well
acquainted
with
the
coast
if
you
wass
thinking
of
having
a
yacht
ingram
there
is
one
i
hef
heard
of
just
now
in
rothesay
that
is
for
sale
and
she
is
a
ferry
good
boat
but
not
so
big
as
this
think
wait
till
my
wife
knows
more
about
it
mackenzie
ingram
said
till
she
gets
round
ardnamurchan
and
has
crossed
the
munch
and
has
got
the
fine
atlantic
swell
as
you
run
into
you
frighten
me
his
wife
said
was
beginning
to
give
myself
it
is
mere
nonsense
cried
mackenzie
impatiently
pless
me
there
is
no
chance
of
your
being
ill
in
this
fine
weather
and
if
you
had
a
boat
of
your
own
you
would
ferry
soon
get
accustomed
to
the
weather
oh
ferry
soon
indeed
and
you
would
hef
no
more
fear
of
the
water
than
sheila
has
far
too
little
fear
of
the
water
her
husband
said
and
that
is
true
said
her
father
it
is
not
right
that
a
young
lass
should
go
about
by
herself
in
a
you
know
very
well
papa
i
never
do
that
you
do
not
do
it
now
grumbled
mackenzie
you
do
not
do
it
now
but
some
day
you
will
forget
when
there
is
something
to
be
done
and
you
will
run
a
great
danger
she
has
promised
never
to
go
out
by
herself
you
sheila
her
husband
said
did
i
promised
that
to
you
and
i
have
never
been
out
since
by
forget
sheila
said
her
father
not
very
sure
but
that
some
sudden
occasion
might
tempt
the
girl
to
her
old
deeds
of
recklessness
the
two
american
ladies
had
little
to
fear
the
hebrides
received
them
with
fair
sunshine
and
smooth
seas
and
all
the
day
long
their
occupation
was
but
to
watch
the
wild
birds
flying
from
island
to
island
and
mark
the
gliding
by
of
the
beautiful
coasts
and
listen
to
the
light
rushing
of
the
waves
as
the
fresh
flew
through
the
rigging
and
sheila
was
proud
to
teach
them
something
of
the
mystery
of
sailing
a
small
craft
and
would
give
them
the
tiller
sometimes
while
her
eye
as
clear
and
keen
as
her
kept
watch
and
ward
over
the
shapely
vessel
that
was
making
for
the
northern
seas
one
evening
she
said
to
her
friends
you
see
that
point
that
runs
out
on
this
side
of
the
small
island
round
that
we
enter
loch
the
last
pale
light
of
the
sun
was
shining
along
the
houses
of
borvapost
as
the
princess
sheila
passed
the
people
there
had
made
out
the
yacht
long
ere
she
came
close
to
land
and
mackenzie
knew
that
twenty
eager
scouts
would
fly
to
tell
the
news
to
scarlett
and
duncan
so
that
ample
preparation
would
be
made
in
the
house
down
by
the
sea
the
wind
however
had
almost
died
away
and
they
were
a
long
time
getting
into
loch
roag
in
this
clear
twilight
they
who
were
making
their
first
visit
to
island
sat
contentedly
enough
on
deck
however
amazed
and
bewildered
by
the
beauty
of
the
scene
around
them
for
now
the
sun
had
long
sunk
but
there
was
a
glow
all
over
the
heavens
and
only
in
the
far
east
did
the
yellow
stars
begin
to
glimmer
over
the
dark
plain
of
the
loch
mealasabhal
suainabhal
cracabhal
lifted
their
grand
shoulders
and
peaks
into
this
wondrous
sky
and
stood
dark
and
clear
there
with
the
silence
of
the
sea
around
them
as
the
night
came
on
the
yellow
stars
grew
more
intense
overhead
but
the
lambent
glow
in
the
north
did
not
pale
they
entered
a
small
bay
up
there
on
a
plateau
of
the
rocks
stood
a
long
low
house
with
all
its
windows
gleaming
in
the
dusk
the
pinnace
was
put
off
from
the
yacht
in
the
strange
silence
of
the
night
the
ripples
plashed
around
her
prow
her
oars
struck
fire
in
the
water
as
the
men
rowed
into
the
land
and
then
as
guests
made
their
way
up
to
the
house
and
when
they
reached
the
verandah
and
turned
to
look
at
the
sea
and
the
loch
and
the
far
mountains
opposite
they
beheld
the
clear
and
golden
sickle
of
the
moon
rising
from
behind
the
black
outline
of
suainabhal
into
the
soft
and
violet
skies
as
the
yellow
moon
rose
in
the
south
a
pathway
of
gold
began
to
tremble
on
loch
roag
and
they
could
see
the
white
curve
of
sand
around
the
bay
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
cold
smell
of
the
sea
there
was
a
murmur
of
the
far
atlantic
all
around
the
silent
coast
it
was
the
old
familiar
picture
that
had
charmed
the
imagination
of
first
and
only
lover
when
as
yet
she
was
to
him
as
some
fair
and
wonderful
princess
living
in
a
lonely
island
and
clothed
around
about
with
the
glamor
of
old
legends
and
stories
of
the
sea
was
she
any
longer
this
strange
with
dreams
in
her
eyes
and
the
mystery
of
the
night
and
the
stars
written
in
her
beautiful
face
or
was
she
to
him
now
what
all
the
world
long
ago
perceived
her
to
be
a
tender
wife
a
faithful
companion
and
a
true
and
woman
sheila
walked
quietly
into
the
house
there
was
something
there
for
her
friends
to
see
and
with
a
great
pride
and
gentleness
and
gladness
scarlett
was
despatched
on
a
particular
errand
the
old
king
of
borva
was
still
down
at
the
yacht
looking
after
the
landing
of
certain
small
articles
of
luggage
duncan
had
come
forward
to
ingram
and
said
are
you
ferry
well
sir
and
mairi
come
down
from
house
had
done
the
same
then
there
was
a
wild
squeal
of
the
pipes
in
the
long
apartment
where
supper
was
laid
the
unearthly
gathering
cry
of
a
clan
until
husband
dashed
into
the
place
and
threatened
to
throw
john
into
the
sea
if
he
did
not
hold
his
peace
john
was
offended
and
would
probably
have
gone
up
the
hillside
and
in
revenge
played
shall
no
more
return
only
that
he
knew
the
irate
old
king
of
borva
would
in
such
a
case
literally
fulfill
the
threat
that
had
been
lightly
uttered
by
his
in
another
room
where
two
or
three
women
were
together
one
of
them
suddenly
took
both
of
hands
in
hers
and
said
with
a
great
look
of
kindness
in
her
eyes
dear
