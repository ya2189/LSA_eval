the

i
introductory
the
races
at
southampton
have
for
time
immemorial
constituted
a
scene
of
rivalship
war
and
envy
all
the
passions
incident
to
the
human
frame
have
here
assumed
as
true
a
scope
as
in
the
more
noisy
and
more
tragical
contentions
of
statesmen
and
warriors
here
nature
has
displayed
her
most
hidden
attractions
and
art
has
furnished
out
the
artillery
of
beauty
here
the
coquet
has
surprised
and
the
nymph
has
sapped
the
heart
of
the
unwary
swain
the
scene
has
been
equally
sought
by
the
bolder
and
more
haughty
as
by
the
timid
sex
here
the
foxhunter
has
sought
a
new
subject
of
his
boast
in
the
of
the
peer
has
played
off
the
dazzling
charms
of
a
coronet
and
a
star
and
the
has
employed
the
anxious
niceties
of
dress
of
all
the
beauties
in
this
brilliant
circle
she
who
was
incomparably
the
most
celebrated
was
the
graceful
delia
her
person
though
not
absolutely
tall
had
an
air
of
dignity
her
form
was
bewitching
and
her
neck
was
alabaster
her
cheeks
glowed
with
the
lovely
vermilion
of
nature
her
mouth
was
small
and
pouting
her
lips
were
coral
and
her
teeth
whiter
than
the
driven
snow
her
forehead
was
bold
high
and
polished
her
eyebrows
were
arched
and
from
beneath
them
her
fine
blue
eyes
shone
with
intelligence
and
sparkled
with
heedless
gaiety
her
hair
was
of
the
brightest
auburn
it
was
in
the
greatest
abundance
and
when
unfettered
by
the
ligaments
of
fashion
it
flowed
about
her
shoulders
and
her
lovely
neck
it
presented
the
most
ravishing
object
that
can
possibly
be
imagined
with
all
this
beauty
it
can
not
be
supposed
but
that
delia
was
followed
by
a
train
of
admirers
the
celebrated
prattle
for
whom
a
thousand
fair
ones
cracked
their
fans
and
tore
their
caps
was
one
of
the
first
to
enlist
himself
among
her
adorers
squire
savage
the
who
like
hippolitus
of
old
chased
the
wily
fox
and
timid
hare
and
had
never
yet
acknowledged
the
empire
of
beauty
was
subdued
by
the
artless
sweetness
of
delia
nay
it
has
been
reported
that
the
incomparable
lord
martin
a
peer
of
ten
thousand
pounds
a
year
had
made
advances
to
her
father
it
is
true
his
lordship
was
scarcely
four
feet
three
inches
in
stature
his
belly
was
prominent
one
leg
was
half
a
foot
shorter
and
one
shoulder
half
a
foot
higher
than
the
other
his
temper
was
as
crooked
as
his
shape
the
sight
of
a
happy
human
being
would
give
him
the
spleen
and
no
mortal
man
could
long
reside
under
the
same
roof
with
him
but
in
spite
of
these
trifling
imperfections
it
has
been
confidently
affirmed
that
some
of
the
haughtiest
beauties
of
hampshire
would
have
been
proud
of
his
alliance
thus
assailed
with
all
the
temptations
that
human
nature
could
furnish
it
might
naturally
be
supposed
that
delia
had
long
since
resigned
her
heart
but
in
this
conjecture
however
natural
the
reader
will
find
himself
mistaken
she
seemed
as
coy
as
daphne
and
as
cold
as
diana
she
diverted
herself
indeed
with
the
insignificant
loquaciousness
of
prattle
and
the
aukward
gallantry
of
the
squire
but
she
never
bestowed
upon
either
a
serious
thought
and
for
lord
martin
who
was
indisputably
allowed
to
be
the
best
match
in
the
county
she
could
not
bear
to
hear
him
named
with
patience
and
she
always
turned
pale
at
the
sight
of
him
but
delia
was
not
destined
always
to
laugh
at
the
darts
of
cupid
bridget
her
waiting
maid
delighted
to
run
over
the
list
of
her
adorers
and
she
was
much
more
eloquent
and
more
copious
upon
the
subject
than
we
have
been
when
her
mistress
received
the
mention
of
each
with
gay
indifference
bridget
would
close
the
dialogue
and
with
a
sagacious
look
and
a
shake
of
her
head
would
tell
the
lovely
delia
that
the
longer
it
was
before
her
time
came
the
more
surely
and
the
more
deeply
she
would
be
caught
at
last
and
to
say
truth
the
wisest
philosopher
might
have
joined
in
the
verdict
of
the
sage
bridget
there
was
a
softness
in
the
temper
of
delia
that
seemed
particularly
formed
for
the
tender
passion
the
voice
of
misery
never
assailed
her
ear
in
vain
her
purse
was
always
open
to
the
orphan
the
maimed
and
the
sick
after
reading
a
tender
tale
of
love
the
intricacies
of
the
princess
of
cleves
the
soft
distress
of
sophia
western
or
the
more
modern
story
of
the
sorrows
of
werter
her
gentle
breast
would
heave
with
sighs
and
her
eye
suffused
with
tears
confess
a
congenial
spirit
the
father
of
delia
let
the
reader
drop
a
tear
over
this
blot
in
our
little
narrative
had
once
been
a
tradesman
he
was
naturally
phlegmatic
methodical
and
avaricious
his
ear
was
formed
to
relish
better
the
hoarse
voice
of
an
exchange
broker
than
the
finest
tones
of
handel
organ
he
found
something
much
more
agreeable
and
interesting
in
the
perusal
of
his
ledger
and
his
day
book
than
in
the
scenes
of
shakespeare
or
the
elegance
of
addison
with
this
disposition
he
had
notwithstanding
when
age
had
chilled
the
vigour
of
his
limbs
and
scattered
her
snow
over
those
hairs
which
had
escaped
the
hands
of
the
barber
resigned
his
shop
and
retired
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
his
industry
it
is
as
natural
for
a
tradesman
in
modern
times
to
desire
to
die
in
the
tranquillity
of
a
gentleman
as
it
was
for
the
saxon
kings
of
the
heptarchy
to
act
the
same
inevitable
scene
amidst
the
severities
of
a
cloister
the
old
gentleman
however
found
and
it
is
not
impossible
that
some
of
his
brethren
may
have
found
it
before
him
when
the
great
transaction
was
irretrievably
over
that
retirement
and
indolence
did
not
constitute
the
situation
for
which
either
nature
or
habit
had
fitted
him
it
has
been
observed
by
some
of
those
philosophers
who
have
made
the
human
mind
the
object
of
their
study
that
idleness
is
often
the
mother
of
love
it
might
indeed
have
been
supposed
that
hartley
for
that
was
his
name
by
having
attained
the
age
of
sixty
might
have
outlived
every
danger
of
this
kind
but
opportunity
and
temptation
supplied
that
which
might
have
been
deficient
on
the
side
of
nature
within
a
little
mile
of
the
mansion
in
which
he
had
taken
up
his
retreat
resided
two
ancient
maiden
ladies
under
cover
of
the
venerable
age
to
which
they
had
attained
they
had
laid
aside
many
of
those
modes
which
coyness
and
modesty
have
prescribed
to
their
sex
the
visits
of
a
man
were
avowedly
as
welcome
to
them
and
indeed
much
more
so
than
those
of
a
woman
their
want
of
attractions
either
external
or
mental
had
indeed
hindered
the
circle
of
their
acquaintance
from
being
very
extensive
but
there
were
some
as
well
as
hartley
who
preferred
the
company
of
ugliness
censoriousness
and
ill
nature
to
solitude
such
were
the
miss
cranley
the
name
of
the
elder
of
whom
was
amelia
and
that
of
the
younger
sophia
miss
amelia
was
nominally
forty
and
her
sister
thirty
years
of
age
perhaps
if
we
stated
the
matter
more
accurately
we
should
rate
the
elder
at
and
the
younger
somewhere
about
fifty
they
both
of
them
were
masculine
in
their
behaviour
and
studious
in
their
disposition
miss
amelia
delighted
in
the
study
of
theology
she
disputed
with
the
curate
maintained
a
godly
correspondence
with
a
neighbouring
cobler
and
was
even
said
to
be
preparing
a
pamphlet
in
defence
of
the
dogmas
of
whitfield
miss
sophia
who
will
make
a
much
more
considerable
figure
in
this
history
was
altogether
as
indefatigable
in
the
study
of
politics
as
her
sister
was
in
that
of
theology
she
adhered
indeed
to
none
of
our
political
parties
for
she
suspected
and
despised
them
all
my
lord
north
she
treated
as
stupid
sleepy
and
void
of
personal
principle
fox
was
a
brawling
gamester
devoid
of
all
attachments
but
that
of
ambition
and
who
treated
the
mob
with
flattery
and
contempt
burke
was
a
jesuit
in
disguise
who
under
the
most
specious
professions
was
capable
of
the
blackest
and
meanest
actions
for
her
own
part
she
was
a
steady
republican
that
couplet
of
garth
was
continually
in
her
mouth
my
very
soul
i
hate
all
kings
and
ministers
of
chapter
ii
thus
much
it
was
necessary
to
premise
in
order
to
acquaint
the
reader
with
the
situation
of
our
heroine
and
that
of
some
other
personages
in
this
history
having
discharged
this
task
we
will
return
to
the
point
from
which
we
set
out
it
was
at
one
of
the
balls
at
the
races
at
southampton
the
company
was
already
assembled
the
card
tables
were
set
and
our
maiden
ladies
together
with
many
other
venerable
pieces
of
antiquity
were
assembled
around
them
in
another
and
more
spacious
room
appeared
all
that
southampton
could
boast
of
youth
and
beauty
the
squire
and
his
sister
prattle
and
lord
martin
formed
a
part
of
the
company
the
first
bustle
was
nearly
composed
when
damon
entered
the
assembly
he
appeared
to
be
a
stranger
to
every
body
present
and
as
he
is
equally
a
stranger
to
our
readers
we
will
now
announce
him
in
proper
form
damon
appeared
to
be
about
twenty
years
of
age
his
person
was
tall
and
his
limbs
slender
and
well
formed
his
dress
was
elegance
itself
his
coat
was
ornamented
with
a
profusion
of
lace
and
the
diamond
sparkled
in
his
shoe
his
countenance
was
manly
and
erect
there
appeared
in
it
a
noble
confidence
which
the
spectator
would
at
first
sight
ascribe
to
dignity
of
birth
and
a
perfect
familiarity
with
whatever
is
elegant
and
polite
this
confidence
however
had
not
the
least
alloy
of
his
eye
expressed
the
most
open
sensibility
and
the
kindest
sympathy
there
is
something
undescribably
interesting
in
the
figure
we
have
delineated
the
moment
our
hero
entered
the
room
the
attention
of
every
person
present
was
fixed
upon
him
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
immediately
advanced
and
escorted
him
to
the
most
honourable
seat
that
yet
remained
vacant
while
damon
examined
with
an
eager
eye
the
gay
parterre
of
beauty
that
appeared
before
him
a
general
whisper
was
excited
upon
his
account
who
is
he
who
is
he
echoed
from
every
corner
of
the
room
but
while
curiosity
was
busy
in
his
enquiries
there
was
not
an
individual
capable
of
satisfying
them
the
business
of
every
one
was
now
the
choice
of
a
partner
but
as
one
object
had
engrossed
the
attention
of
all
they
were
willing
to
see
the
election
he
would
make
though
every
one
feared
to
lose
the
partner
he
had
destined
for
himself
damon
was
therefore
however
unwilling
to
distinguish
himself
in
so
particular
a
manner
constrained
to
advance
the
foremost
he
passed
slightly
along
before
a
considerable
number
who
sat
in
expectation
at
length
he
approached
the
seat
of
delia
he
bowed
to
her
in
the
most
graceful
manner
and
intreated
to
be
honoured
with
her
hand
she
smiled
assent
and
they
crossed
the
room
among
a
croud
of
envious
rivals
besides
the
lovers
we
had
mentioned
there
were
four
others
who
had
secretly
determined
to
dance
with
delia
but
if
the
gentlemen
were
disappointed
to
whose
eyes
the
beauty
of
delia
however
unrivalled
was
familiar
the
disappointment
and
envy
of
the
fair
sex
upon
the
loss
of
damon
whose
external
and
natural
recommendations
had
beside
the
grace
of
novelty
were
inexpressible
the
daughter
of
griskin
an
eminent
butcher
in
who
had
indeed
from
nature
the
grace
of
being
now
looked
in
ten
thousand
more
various
directions
than
she
ever
did
before
miss
prim
agitated
in
every
limb
cracked
her
fan
into
twenty
pieces
miss
gawky
who
had
unfortunately
been
initiated
by
the
chamber
maid
in
the
art
of
plied
her
box
with
more
zeal
than
ever
miss
languish
actually
fainted
and
was
with
some
difficulty
conveyed
into
the
air
such
was
the
confusion
occasioned
in
the
ball
at
southampton
by
the
election
of
damon
affairs
being
now
somewhat
adjusted
the
dances
began
damon
at
every
interval
addressed
himself
to
his
lovely
partner
in
the
easiest
and
most
elegant
conversation
he
talked
with
fluency
and
his
air
and
manner
gave
a
grace
and
dignity
to
the
most
trifling
topics
the
heart
of
delia
acknowledged
the
charms
of
youthful
beauty
and
graceful
deportment
and
secretly
confessed
that
it
had
never
before
encountered
so
formidable
an
enemy
when
the
usual
topics
of
conversation
had
been
exhausted
the
behaviour
of
damon
became
insensibly
more
particular
he
pressed
her
hand
with
the
most
melting
ardour
and
a
sigh
ever
and
anon
escaped
from
his
breast
he
paid
her
several
very
elegant
compliments
though
they
were
all
of
them
confined
within
the
limits
of
decorum
delia
on
the
other
hand
though
she
apparently
received
them
with
the
most
gay
indifference
in
reality
drank
deep
of
the
poison
of
love
and
the
words
of
damon
made
an
impression
upon
her
heart
that
was
not
easily
to
be
erased
but
however
delicious
was
the
scene
in
which
they
were
engaged
it
necessarily
drew
to
a
conclusion
the
drowsy
clocks
now
announced
the
hour
of
three
in
the
morning
the
dances
broke
up
and
the
company
separated
delia
leaped
into
the
chariot
that
was
waiting
and
quickly
arrived
at
the
parental
mansion
fatigued
with
the
various
objects
that
had
passed
before
her
she
immediately
retired
to
rest
for
some
time
however
a
busy
train
of
thoughts
detained
her
from
the
empire
of
sleep
how
lovely
a
stranger
how
elegant
his
manners
and
how
brilliant
his
wit
how
soft
and
engaging
the
whole
of
his
behaviour
but
ah
was
this
the
fruit
of
reverence
and
admiration
might
it
not
be
no
more
than
general
gallantry
oh
that
i
were
mistress
of
his
heart
that
he
would
lay
his
person
at
my
feet
what
a
contrast
between
him
and
my
former
admirers
how
doubly
hateful
does
lord
martin
the
lover
favoured
by
my
father
now
appear
but
ah
who
is
this
damon
what
is
his
fortune
and
what
his
pretensions
his
dress
surely
bespoke
him
a
man
of
rank
his
elegant
manners
could
have
been
learned
in
no
vulgar
circle
how
sweet
methinks
is
suspence
how
delightful
the
uncertainty
that
hangs
about
him
and
yet
how
glad
should
i
be
to
have
my
doubts
resolved
soothed
with
these
and
similar
reflections
the
lovely
maid
fell
asleep
but
even
in
sleep
she
did
not
forget
the
impressions
she
had
received
she
imagined
that
damon
now
approached
her
pillow
but
how
unlike
the
damon
she
had
seen
his
eyes
had
something
in
them
superior
to
a
mortal
his
shoulders
were
adorned
with
wings
and
a
vest
of
celestial
azure
flowed
around
him
he
smiled
upon
her
with
the
most
bewitching
grace
but
the
gentle
maid
involuntarily
stretched
out
her
arms
towards
him
and
the
pleasing
vision
vanished
from
her
sight
again
she
closed
her
eyes
and
again
she
endeavoured
to
regain
her
former
object
damon
indeed
appeared
but
in
how
different
a
manner
his
countenance
was
impressed
with
every
mark
of
horror
and
he
seemed
to
fly
before
some
who
inveterately
pursued
him
they
appeared
with
the
countenances
of
furies
and
the
snakes
hissed
around
their
temples
delia
looked
earnestly
upon
them
and
presently
recollected
the
features
of
the
admirers
we
have
already
celebrated
the
noble
peer
under
the
figure
of
tisiphone
led
the
troop
damon
stumbled
and
fell
sudden
as
lightning
tisiphone
reached
the
spot
and
plunged
a
dagger
in
his
heart
she
drew
it
forth
reeking
with
blood
and
the
lovely
youth
appeared
in
the
agonies
of
death
terrified
beyond
measure
delia
screamed
with
horror
and
awoke
in
the
midst
of
reveries
like
these
now
agitated
with
apprehension
and
now
soothed
with
pleasure
delia
passed
the
night
the
sun
appeared
her
gold
repeater
informed
her
that
it
was
twelve
and
assisted
by
the
fair
hands
of
bridget
she
began
to
rise
chapter
iii
hartley
had
breakfasted
and
walked
out
in
the
fields
before
delia
appeared
she
had
scarcely
begun
her
morning
repast
ere
miss
fletcher
the
favourite
companion
and
confidante
of
delia
entered
the
room
my
dearest
creature
cried
the
visitor
how
do
you
do
had
not
we
not
a
most
charming
evening
i
vow
i
was
fatigued
to
death
and
then
lord
martin
i
think
he
never
appeared
to
so
much
advantage
why
he
was
quite
covered
with
diamonds
spangles
and
frogs
ah
cried
delia
but
the
young
stranger
true
answered
miss
fletcher
i
liked
him
of
all
things
so
tall
so
genteel
and
so
sweetly
i
can
not
think
who
he
is
i
called
upon
miss
griskin
and
i
called
upon
miss
savage
nobody
knows
he
is
some
great
man
when
did
he
come
to
town
said
delia
where
does
he
lodge
my
dear
he
came
to
town
yesterday
in
the
evening
and
went
away
again
as
soon
as
the
ball
was
over
but
do
not
you
think
that
prattle
new
suit
of
scarlet
sattin
was
vastly
becoming
i
vow
i
could
have
fallen
in
love
with
him
he
is
so
gay
and
so
trifling
and
so
fond
of
hearing
himself
talk
why
does
not
he
say
a
number
of
smart
things
it
is
exessively
strange
said
delia
she
was
thinking
of
the
stranger
but
miss
fletcher
went
on
not
at
all
my
life
upon
my
word
i
think
he
is
always
very
entertaining
he
cuts
out
paper
so
prettily
and
he
has
drawn
me
the
sweetest
pattern
for
an
apron
i
vow
i
think
i
never
showed
you
it
what
can
be
his
name
said
delia
his
name
my
dear
law
child
you
do
not
hear
a
word
one
says
to
you
but
of
all
things
give
me
the
green
coat
and
pink
breeches
of
savage
but
did
you
ever
hear
the
like
there
will
be
a
terrible
to
do
lord
martin
is
in
such
a
quandary
he
has
sent
people
far
and
near
i
wish
they
may
find
him
exclaimed
delia
nay
if
they
do
i
would
not
be
in
his
shoes
for
the
world
my
lord
vows
revenge
he
says
he
is
his
rival
why
child
the
stranger
did
not
make
love
to
you
did
he
mercy
on
us
cried
delia
then
my
dream
is
out
oh
bless
us
said
miss
fletcher
what
dream
my
dear
her
curiosity
then
prevailed
upon
her
to
be
silent
for
a
few
moments
while
delia
related
that
with
which
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
in
return
delia
requested
of
her
friend
to
explain
to
her
more
intelligibly
what
she
hinted
of
the
anger
of
lord
martin
why
my
dear
his
lordship
has
been
employed
all
this
morning
in
writing
challenges
they
say
he
has
not
writ
less
than
a
dozen
and
has
sent
them
by
as
many
messengers
like
a
hue
and
cry
all
over
the
county
my
lord
is
a
little
man
but
what
of
that
he
is
as
stout
as
hercules
and
as
brave
as
d
that
you
and
i
read
of
in
pope
homer
he
is
in
such
a
vengeance
of
a
passion
that
he
can
not
contain
himself
he
tells
it
to
every
body
he
sees
and
his
mother
and
sister
run
about
the
house
screaming
and
fainting
like
so
many
mad
things
delia
as
we
have
already
said
was
endowed
with
a
competent
share
of
natural
understanding
she
therefore
easily
perceived
that
from
an
anger
so
boisterous
and
so
public
no
very
fatal
effects
were
to
be
apprehended
this
reflection
quieted
the
terrors
that
her
dream
had
excited
and
which
the
young
partiality
she
began
to
feel
for
the
amiable
stranger
would
otherwise
have
confirmed
her
breast
being
thus
calmed
she
made
about
half
a
dozen
morning
visits
among
which
one
to
miss
griskin
and
another
to
miss
languish
were
included
the
conversation
every
where
turned
upon
the
outrageousness
of
lord
martin
all
but
the
gentle
delia
were
full
of
anxiety
and
expectation
the
females
were
broken
into
parties
respecting
the
event
of
the
duel
many
trembled
for
the
fate
of
lord
martin
so
splendid
so
rich
and
consequently
in
their
opinion
so
amiable
and
so
witty
others
guided
by
the
unadulterated
sentiments
of
nature
poured
forth
all
their
vows
for
the
courteous
unknown
may
those
active
limbs
remain
without
a
wound
may
his
elegant
blue
and
silver
never
be
stained
with
blood
ah
what
a
pity
that
eyes
so
bright
and
teeth
so
white
should
be
shrowded
in
the
darkness
of
the
grave
the
dinner
a
vulgar
meal
that
passed
exactly
in
the
same
manner
as
fifty
dinners
had
before
it
shall
be
consigned
to
silence
the
evening
was
bright
and
calm
it
was
in
the
close
of
autumn
and
every
thing
tempted
our
lovely
fair
one
to
take
the
air
by
the
way
she
called
upon
her
inseparable
friend
and
companion
they
directed
their
course
towards
the
sea
side
here
they
had
not
advanced
far
before
they
entered
a
grove
a
spot
particularly
the
favourite
of
delia
in
a
little
opening
there
was
a
bank
embroidered
with
daisies
and
a
little
row
of
willows
bending
their
heads
forward
formed
a
kind
of
canopy
and
directly
before
it
there
was
a
vista
through
the
trees
which
afforded
a
distant
prospect
of
the
sea
with
every
here
and
there
a
vessel
passing
along
and
the
beams
of
the
setting
sun
quivered
on
the
waves
delia
and
her
companion
advanced
towards
the
well
known
spot
the
mellow
voice
of
the
thrush
and
the
clear
pipe
of
the
blackbird
diversified
at
intervals
with
the
tender
notes
of
the
nightingale
formed
the
most
agreable
natural
concert
the
breast
of
delia
framed
for
softness
and
melancholy
was
filled
with
sensations
responsive
to
the
objects
around
her
and
even
the
eternal
clack
of
miss
fletcher
was
still
presently
however
a
new
and
unexpected
object
claimed
their
attention
a
note
stronger
and
sweeter
than
that
of
any
of
the
native
choristers
of
the
grove
swelled
upon
the
air
and
floated
towards
them
having
approached
a
few
paces
they
stood
still
to
listen
it
seemed
to
proceed
from
a
flute
played
upon
by
a
human
voice
the
air
was
melancholy
but
the
skill
was
divine
the
native
curiosity
of
miss
fletcher
was
not
upon
this
occasion
a
match
for
the
sympathetic
spirit
of
delia
she
pressed
forward
with
an
eager
and
uncertain
step
and
looking
through
an
interstice
formed
by
two
venerable
oaks
she
perceived
the
figure
of
a
young
man
sitting
in
her
favourite
alcove
his
back
was
turned
towards
the
side
upon
which
she
was
having
finished
the
air
he
threw
his
flute
carelesly
from
him
and
folded
his
arms
in
a
posture
the
most
disconsolate
that
can
be
imagined
he
rose
and
advanced
a
little
with
an
irregular
step
ah
lovely
mistress
of
my
soul
cried
he
thou
little
regardest
the
anguish
that
must
for
ever
be
an
inmate
of
this
breast
while
i
am
a
prey
to
a
thousand
tormenting
imaginations
thou
riotest
in
the
empire
of
beauty
heedless
of
the
wounds
thou
inflicted
and
the
slaves
thou
chainest
to
thy
chariot
wretch
that
i
am
what
is
to
be
done
but
i
must
think
no
more
saying
this
he
snatched
up
his
flute
and
thrusting
it
into
his
bosom
hurried
out
of
the
grove
while
he
spoke
delia
imagined
that
the
voice
was
one
that
she
had
heard
before
though
she
knew
not
where
her
heart
whispered
her
something
more
than
her
understanding
could
disentangle
but
as
he
stooped
to
take
his
flute
from
the
ground
his
profile
was
necessarily
turned
towards
the
inner
part
of
the
grove
delia
started
and
trembled
damon
stood
confessed
but
she
scarcely
recollected
his
features
before
he
rushed
away
swifter
than
the
winged
hawk
and
was
immediately
out
of
sight
delia
was
too
full
of
a
thousand
reflections
upon
this
unexpected
rencounter
to
be
able
to
utter
a
word
but
miss
fletcher
immediately
began
god
bless
us
cried
she
did
you
ever
see
the
like
why
it
is
my
belief
it
is
a
ghost
or
a
wizard
i
never
heard
any
thing
so
pretty
i
vow
i
am
terribly
frightened
delia
now
caught
hold
of
her
arm
for
heaven
sake
let
us
quit
the
grove
i
do
not
know
what
is
the
matter
but
i
feel
myself
quite
sick
good
god
good
heavens
well
i
do
not
wonder
you
are
all
in
a
tremble
but
suppose
now
it
should
be
nothing
but
prattle
he
is
always
somewhere
or
other
and
then
he
plays
save
the
and
and
like
any
thing
oh
said
the
lovely
trembling
nymph
they
were
the
sweetest
notes
ah
said
her
companion
he
is
a
fine
man
and
then
he
is
so
modest
he
will
play
at
one
and
thirty
and
ride
upon
a
stick
with
little
tommy
all
day
long
but
sure
it
could
not
be
prattle
he
always
wears
his
hair
in
a
queue
you
know
but
the
ghost
had
a
bag
and
solitaire
well
cried
delia
let
us
think
no
more
of
it
but
did
we
hear
anything
law
child
why
he
played
the
nicest
glee
and
then
he
made
such
a
speech
for
all
the
world
like
button
that
i
like
so
to
see
in
hamlet
true
said
delia
but
what
he
said
was
more
like
the
soft
complainings
of
my
dear
castalio
did
not
he
complain
of
a
false
mistress
why
he
did
say
something
of
that
if
it
be
neither
a
ghost
nor
prattle
i
hope
in
god
he
is
going
to
appear
upon
the
southampton
stage
i
do
so
love
to
see
a
fine
young
man
come
on
for
the
first
time
with
this
alspishus
day
be
ever
sacred
or
am
thy
father
chapter
iv
love
in
such
conversation
the
moments
passed
till
they
reached
the
habitation
of
hartley
miss
fletcher
now
took
her
leave
and
after
a
supper
as
dull
and
much
more
tedious
to
delia
than
the
dinner
she
retired
to
her
chamber
she
retired
indeed
but
not
to
rest
her
brain
was
filled
with
a
croud
of
uneasy
thoughts
alas
said
she
how
short
has
been
the
illusion
but
yesterday
i
was
flushed
with
all
the
pride
of
conquest
and
busily
framed
a
thousand
schemes
of
ideal
happiness
where
are
they
now
the
lovely
youth
the
only
man
i
ever
saw
in
whose
favour
my
heart
was
prepossessed
and
with
whom
i
should
have
felt
no
repugnance
to
have
engaged
in
the
tenderest
ties
is
nothing
to
me
he
loves
another
he
too
complains
of
slighted
passion
and
love
ah
had
he
made
his
happiness
depend
on
me
what
would
not
i
have
done
to
reward
him
carefully
i
would
have
soothed
every
anguish
and
taught
his
heart
to
bound
with
joy
but
what
am
i
saying
where
am
i
going
am
i
that
delia
that
bad
defiance
to
the
art
of
men
that
saw
with
indifference
the
havock
that
my
charms
had
made
with
every
opening
morn
i
smiled
each
hour
was
sped
with
joy
and
my
heart
was
light
and
frolic
and
shall
i
dwindle
into
a
pensive
melancholy
maid
the
sacrifice
of
one
that
heeds
me
not
whose
sighs
no
answering
sighs
encounter
let
it
not
be
said
i
have
hitherto
asserted
the
independence
of
my
sex
i
will
continue
to
do
so
too
amiable
unknown
i
give
thee
to
the
winds
propitious
fate
i
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
so
soon
discovered
how
much
my
partiality
was
misplaced
i
will
abjure
it
before
it
be
too
late
i
will
tear
the
little
intruder
from
my
heart
before
the
mischief
is
become
irretrievable
the
following
evening
delia
repaired
again
by
a
kind
of
irresistible
impulse
to
the
grove
she
asked
not
the
company
of
her
friend
she
dared
alone
hazard
the
encounter
of
that
object
at
which
she
had
trembled
so
much
the
preceding
day
unknown
to
herself
she
still
imaged
a
kind
of
uncertainty
in
her
fate
which
would
not
permit
her
to
lay
aside
all
thought
of
damon
she
determined
at
all
events
to
have
her
doubts
resolved
when
there
is
no
longer
said
she
to
herself
any
room
for
mistake
i
shall
then
know
what
to
do
as
she
drew
near
the
alcove
she
perceived
the
same
figure
stretched
along
the
bank
and
with
his
eyes
immoveably
fixed
upon
a
little
fountain
that
rose
in
a
corner
of
the
scene
he
seemed
lost
in
thought
delia
approached
doubtfully
but
he
heard
her
not
advanced
near
to
her
object
she
reclined
forward
in
a
posture
of
wonder
and
attention
at
this
moment
a
sigh
burst
from
the
heart
of
damon
and
he
raised
himself
upon
the
seat
his
eyes
caught
the
figure
of
ah
said
he
starting
from
his
trance
what
do
i
see
art
thou
lovely
intruder
a
mere
vision
an
aerial
being
that
shuns
the
touch
i
beg
ten
thousand
pardons
i
meaned
not
sir
to
interrupt
you
i
will
be
gone
no
go
not
answered
he
thou
art
welcome
to
my
troubled
thoughts
i
could
gaze
for
ever
saying
this
he
rose
and
advancing
towards
her
seized
her
hand
be
not
afraid
said
he
gentle
fair
one
my
breast
is
a
stranger
to
violence
and
rudeness
i
have
felt
the
dart
of
love
unhappy
myself
i
learn
to
feel
for
others
but
you
are
happy
as
he
said
this
a
tear
unbidden
stole
into
the
eye
of
delia
and
she
wiped
it
away
with
the
hand
which
was
disengaged
from
his
and
dost
thou
pity
me
said
he
and
does
such
softness
dwell
within
thy
breast
if
you
knew
the
story
of
my
woes
you
would
have
reason
to
pity
me
i
am
in
love
to
destraction
but
i
dare
not
disclose
my
passion
i
am
banished
from
the
presence
of
her
i
love
ah
cruel
fate
i
am
entangled
inextricably
entangled
and
how
sir
said
delia
can
i
serve
you
alas
said
he
in
no
way
my
case
is
hopeless
and
irretrievable
and
what
am
i
doing
why
do
i
talk
when
the
season
calls
for
action
oh
i
am
lost
dear
sir
answered
delia
you
terrify
me
to
death
oh
no
i
would
not
for
the
world
give
you
an
uneasy
moment
let
me
be
unhappy
but
may
misfortune
never
disturb
your
tranquility
i
return
to
seek
her
whose
fate
is
surely
destined
to
mix
with
mine
pardon
loveliest
of
thy
sex
the
distraction
in
which
i
have
appeared
i
would
ask
you
to
forget
me
i
would
ask
you
to
remember
me
i
know
not
what
i
am
or
what
to
think
with
these
words
he
took
the
hand
which
he
still
held
in
one
of
his
and
raising
it
to
his
lips
kissed
it
with
the
utmost
fervour
immediately
he
caught
up
his
hat
which
lay
beside
him
on
the
ground
and
began
to
advance
along
the
path
that
led
out
of
the
grove
on
the
side
furthest
from
the
town
but
his
eyes
were
still
fixed
upon
delia
he
heeded
not
the
path
by
which
he
went
and
scarcely
had
he
gone
twenty
paces
ere
he
changed
his
mind
and
returned
delia
was
seated
on
the
bank
and
seemed
lost
in
reverie
damon
threw
himself
upon
his
knees
before
her
ah
why
said
he
am
i
constrained
to
depart
why
must
i
talk
in
riddles
perhaps
we
may
never
see
each
other
more
perhaps
the
time
will
come
when
i
shall
be
able
to
clear
up
the
obscurity
that
at
present
i
am
obliged
to
preserve
but
no
it
can
not
be
i
never
was
happy
but
for
two
poor
hours
that
i
enjoyed
your
smiles
and
drinking
in
the
poison
of
your
charms
i
forgot
myself
the
time
too
soon
arrived
for
bitter
recollection
my
mistress
calls
the
mistress
of
my
fate
i
must
be
gone
farewel
for
ever
saying
this
he
heaved
a
sigh
that
seemed
almost
to
tear
his
breast
asunder
and
with
the
utmost
apparent
violence
he
tore
himself
away
and
rushed
along
the
path
with
incredible
velocity
delia
was
now
alone
but
instead
as
she
had
flattered
herself
of
having
her
doubts
resolved
she
was
more
uncertain
more
perplexed
than
ever
what
cried
she
can
all
this
mean
how
strange
and
how
inexplicable
is
it
a
real
person
that
i
have
seen
or
is
it
a
vision
that
mocks
my
fancy
am
i
loved
or
am
i
hated
oh
foolish
question
oh
fond
illusion
are
we
not
parted
for
ever
is
he
not
gone
to
seek
the
mistress
of
his
soul
alas
he
views
me
not
but
with
that
general
complacency
which
youth
and
the
small
pretensions
i
have
to
beauty
are
calculated
to
excite
he
had
nothing
to
relate
that
concerned
myself
he
merely
intended
to
make
me
the
confidante
of
his
passion
for
another
too
surely
he
is
unhappy
his
heart
seemed
ready
to
burst
with
sorrow
probably
in
this
situation
there
is
no
greater
or
more
immediate
relief
than
to
disclose
the
subject
of
our
distress
and
to
receive
into
our
bosom
the
sympathetic
tear
of
a
simple
and
a
generous
heart
his
behaviour
today
corresponds
but
too
well
with
the
suspicions
that
yesterday
excited
oh
delia
then
added
she
be
firm
thou
shalt
see
the
conqueror
no
more
think
of
him
no
more
in
spite
however
of
all
the
resolution
she
could
muster
delia
repaired
day
after
day
sometimes
alone
and
sometimes
in
company
with
her
friend
to
that
spot
which
by
the
umbrage
of
melancholy
it
wore
was
become
more
interesting
than
ever
miss
fletcher
could
scarcely
at
first
be
persuaded
to
direct
her
course
that
way
lest
she
should
again
see
the
ghost
but
she
need
not
have
terrified
herself
no
ghost
appeared
disappointed
and
baffled
on
this
side
delia
by
the
strictest
enquiries
endeavoured
to
find
out
who
the
unknown
person
was
in
whose
fate
she
had
become
so
greatly
interested
the
result
of
these
enquiries
however
diligent
was
not
entirely
satisfactory
she
learned
that
he
had
been
for
a
few
days
upon
a
visit
to
a
moreland
a
gentleman
who
lived
about
three
miles
from
southampton
moreland
was
a
person
of
a
very
singular
character
he
had
the
reputation
in
the
neighbourhood
of
being
a
cynic
a
misanthrope
and
a
madman
he
kept
very
little
company
and
was
even
seldom
seen
but
by
night
he
had
a
garden
sufficiently
spacious
which
was
carefully
rendered
impervious
to
every
human
eye
and
to
this
and
his
house
he
entirely
confined
himself
in
the
the
persons
he
saw
were
not
the
gentlemen
of
the
neighbourhood
he
had
no
toleration
for
characters
that
did
not
interest
him
when
he
first
came
down
to
his
present
residence
he
was
visited
by
hartley
prattle
squire
savage
lord
martin
and
all
the
most
admired
personages
in
the
country
but
their
visits
had
never
been
returned
prattle
pronounced
him
a
scoundrel
squire
savage
said
he
was
a
nincompoop
and
lord
martin
was
near
sending
him
a
challenge
but
the
censures
of
the
former
and
the
threats
of
the
latter
had
never
reached
his
ears
his
domestics
were
numerous
but
they
were
hired
from
a
distance
and
were
permitted
as
little
communication
as
possible
with
the
powdered
lacquies
of
southampton
of
consequence
however
much
the
unaccommodating
conduct
of
moreland
disposed
his
neighbours
to
calumniate
him
scandal
was
deprived
of
that
daily
food
which
is
requisite
for
her
subsistence
and
the
name
of
that
gentleman
was
scarcely
ever
heard
chapter
man
of
we
will
now
return
to
lord
martin
all
his
messengers
from
what
cruel
fate
we
can
not
exactly
ascertain
miscarried
and
it
was
not
till
damon
had
left
the
country
that
he
learned
that
he
had
been
a
visitor
at
the
house
of
moreland
finding
that
he
had
missed
his
expected
vengeance
he
discharged
his
anger
in
unavailing
curses
and
for
three
days
he
breathed
nothing
but
daggers
death
and
damnation
having
thus
vapoured
away
the
paroxysm
of
his
fury
he
became
tolerably
composed
but
adverse
fate
had
decreed
a
short
duration
to
the
tranquility
of
his
lordship
scarcely
had
the
field
been
cleared
from
the
enemy
he
so
greatly
dreaded
ere
a
new
rival
came
upon
the
stage
to
whose
arms
though
without
any
great
foundation
the
whole
town
of
southampton
had
consigned
the
charming
delia
the
name
of
this
gentleman
was
prettyman
he
was
just
returned
from
his
travels
and
was
reckoned
perfectly
accomplished
he
was
six
foot
high
his
shoulders
were
broad
his
legs
brawny
and
his
whole
person
athletic
the
habits
however
he
had
formed
to
himself
in
foreign
countries
will
not
perhaps
be
allowed
exactly
to
correspond
with
the
figure
which
nature
had
bestowed
upon
him
he
generally
spent
two
hours
every
morning
at
his
toilette
his
face
was
painted
and
patched
his
whole
person
strongly
perfumed
and
he
had
continually
in
his
hand
a
gold
set
with
diamonds
his
voice
was
naturally
hoarse
and
loud
but
with
infinite
industry
he
had
brought
himself
to
a
pronunciation
shrill
piping
and
effeminate
his
conversion
was
larded
with
foreign
phrases
and
foreign
oaths
and
every
thing
he
said
was
accompanied
with
a
significant
shrug
the
same
period
which
had
introduced
this
new
pretender
to
the
heart
of
delia
had
been
distinguished
by
the
arrival
of
a
sir
william
twyford
who
paid
his
addresses
to
miss
fletcher
sir
william
was
exactly
the
reverse
of
prettyman
with
a
genteel
person
and
an
open
and
agreable
phisiognomy
his
manners
were
perfectly
careless
and
unstudied
a
predominant
feature
in
his
character
was
good
nature
but
this
was
not
his
ruling
passion
he
had
an
infinite
fund
of
wit
and
humour
and
he
never
was
so
happy
as
when
he
was
able
to
place
the
foibles
of
affectation
in
a
whimsical
and
ridiculous
light
as
it
was
vanity
alone
that
had
induced
prettyman
to
pay
his
addresses
to
the
lady
who
was
universally
allowed
to
surpass
in
beauty
and
every
elegant
accomplishment
in
the
place
in
which
he
was
he
would
have
been
less
pleased
that
his
amour
should
have
terminated
in
a
marriage
than
that
by
his
affectation
and
coquetry
he
might
break
the
heart
of
the
simple
fair
one
accordingly
it
was
his
business
to
make
the
affair
as
public
as
possible
lord
martin
had
been
sufficiently
irritated
by
the
pretensions
of
damon
the
new
intruder
had
wrought
up
his
passion
to
the
highest
pitch
in
the
mean
time
he
had
renewed
an
acquaintance
which
he
had
formerly
made
with
sir
william
twyford
sir
william
upon
all
occasions
cultivated
the
intimacy
of
such
as
by
any
striking
peculiarities
seemed
to
furnish
a
proper
subject
for
his
humour
he
now
contributed
every
thing
in
his
power
to
inflame
his
lordship
against
prettyman
he
offered
to
become
the
bearer
of
a
challenge
and
to
be
his
lordship
second
in
any
future
combat
lord
martin
broke
off
the
conversation
somewhat
abruptly
and
began
to
reflect
with
himself
upon
what
had
passed
he
had
hitherto
contrived
by
some
means
or
other
though
he
dealt
very
largely
in
challenges
never
to
have
come
to
actual
battle
but
he
had
too
much
reason
to
think
that
if
he
made
sir
william
his
messenger
he
should
not
be
able
with
any
degree
of
honour
to
contrive
an
evasion
it
is
true
said
he
i
am
in
a
most
confounded
passion
but
a
wise
general
never
proceeds
to
action
without
having
first
deliberated
zounds
blood
and
fire
would
i
could
put
an
end
to
the
existence
of
so
presumptuous
a
villain
but
then
it
must
be
considered
that
prettyman
is
six
foot
high
and
i
am
not
five
he
is
as
athletic
as
ajax
but
to
me
nature
has
been
unfavourable
it
is
true
i
understand
cart
and
terce
parry
and
thrust
but
i
have
heard
that
prettyman
studied
under
olivier
many
a
man
has
outlived
the
passage
of
a
bullet
or
the
thrust
of
a
sword
through
him
but
my
constitution
is
so
delicate
curse
blast
it
death
and
the
devil
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
sir
william
as
soon
as
he
had
left
lord
martin
repaired
to
the
lodgings
of
prettyman
after
a
short
general
conversation
he
began
my
dear
friend
here
has
happened
the
unluckiest
thing
in
nature
you
have
made
some
advances
you
know
to
the
charming
delia
true
cried
prettyman
i
have
bestowed
upon
her
a
few
condescending
glances
une
charmante
well
added
sir
william
and
the
whole
town
gives
her
to
you
the
town
is
very
impertinent
there
will
go
two
words
to
that
bargain
my
lord
martin
you
know
has
enlisted
himself
amongst
her
admirers
pox
take
the
blockhead
i
suppose
he
would
marry
her
after
i
have
led
her
a
dance
he
shall
do
what
he
pleases
with
her
but
said
sir
william
my
lord
intends
to
call
you
to
an
account
cried
prettyman
i
thought
i
had
been
in
a
land
of
liberty
but
let
me
tell
you
my
lord
is
very
absolute
he
has
fought
some
half
a
dozen
duels
in
his
time
and
every
body
is
afraid
of
him
suis
honour
the
girl
is
not
worth
fighting
for
oh
said
the
malicious
wit
but
if
you
give
her
up
for
a
few
threats
your
reputation
will
be
ruined
for
ever
dieu
this
reputation
is
a
very
expensive
thing
that
every
girl
is
a
helen
never
so
happy
as
when
people
are
murdering
one
another
and
towns
are
fired
for
her
sake
is
this
same
absolutely
inexorable
i
can
not
tell
said
sir
william
what
may
be
done
if
you
were
to
fly
he
would
pursue
you
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
but
suppose
now
you
were
upon
your
knees
to
retract
your
pretensions
to
this
silly
girl
answered
prettyman
that
is
damned
hard
are
you
sure
his
lordship
is
so
compleat
a
master
of
the
science
of
defence
nay
replied
sir
william
i
can
not
tell
i
believe
indeed
he
never
received
a
wound
but
i
think
i
remember
to
have
heard
of
one
duel
he
fought
in
which
his
antagonist
came
off
with
his
life
ah
that
will
not
do
neither
these
bullets
are
the
aukwardest
things
in
the
world
do
you
think
you
could
not
prevail
with
his
lordship
to
use
only
powder
powder
cried
sir
william
that
is
an
excellent
jest
my
lord
always
loads
with
six
small
slugs
six
slugs
ah
the
bloody
minded
villain
it
is
confounded
hard
that
a
gentleman
can
not
pass
through
life
without
being
with
these
unpolished
vandals
mon
cher
i
will
put
the
affair
entirely
into
your
hands
do
de
bring
me
out
of
this
scrape
as
well
as
you
can
well
my
dear
prettyman
i
will
exert
myself
on
your
account
but
upon
my
soul
i
had
rather
have
an
affair
with
half
a
regiment
of
commissioned
officers
fresh
imported
from
america
sir
william
twyford
having
thus
brought
the
affair
to
some
degree
of
forwardness
now
waited
on
his
lordship
my
dear
lord
martin
said
he
what
have
you
resolved
upon
the
affair
is
briefly
thus
you
must
either
give
up
delia
or
fight
mr
prettyman
give
up
delia
exclaimed
the
little
lord
by
all
that
is
sacred
i
will
sooner
spill
the
last
drop
of
my
blood
but
added
he
what
necessity
is
there
for
the
alternative
you
propose
true
i
fear
no
man
but
to
be
continually
engaged
in
quarrels
would
acquire
me
the
character
of
a
desperado
indeed
said
sir
william
you
have
been
somewhat
lavish
in
those
sort
of
affairs
but
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
be
off
in
the
present
instance
prettyman
has
heard
of
the
bustle
you
made
about
the
fellow
at
the
ball
that
tricked
you
of
your
partner
and
he
will
never
pardon
the
affront
if
you
pay
less
attention
to
him
pox
take
the
blockhead
he
is
mighty
nice
methinks
in
his
temper
i
have
a
great
mind
not
to
gratify
him
oh
cried
sir
william
you
never
had
such
an
opportunity
to
establish
your
character
for
ever
and
the
fellow
i
believe
is
no
better
than
a
coward
at
bottom
it
would
be
endless
to
relate
all
the
stratagems
of
sir
william
to
bring
the
business
to
the
conclusion
he
wished
how
he
terrified
the
brawny
and
anon
he
animated
the
little
peer
his
lordship
felt
the
force
of
his
friend
eloquence
but
even
his
highest
flights
of
heroism
were
qualified
with
temporary
misgivings
for
poor
prettyman
he
feared
to
stay
and
dared
not
fly
if
he
could
have
forgotten
the
danger
he
apprehended
his
good
natured
friend
by
the
studied
exaggerations
in
which
he
was
continually
clothing
it
would
have
perfectly
succeed
in
refreshing
his
memory
but
in
reality
it
was
never
absent
from
his
thoughts
his
slumbers
were
short
and
disturbed
and
he
could
scarcely
close
his
eyes
ere
the
enraged
lord
martin
with
his
sword
drawn
and
his
countenance
flaming
with
inexorable
fury
presented
himself
to
his
affrighted
imagination
at
length
sir
william
by
his
generous
interposition
affected
a
compromise
it
was
agreed
that
prettyman
should
fall
upon
his
knees
before
lord
martin
in
the
public
room
in
the
presence
of
delia
and
asking
his
pardon
put
a
small
cane
into
his
hand
my
lord
said
sir
william
to
the
beau
is
as
generous
as
he
is
brave
he
will
not
make
an
improper
use
of
the
advantage
you
put
into
his
hands
he
will
raise
you
from
the
humble
posture
you
will
have
assumed
and
embracing
you
cordially
all
that
is
past
will
be
forgotten
as
his
lordship
will
take
you
under
his
protection
not
an
individual
will
dare
to
reflect
upon
you
prettyman
said
sir
william
to
lord
martin
unites
the
heart
of
a
chicken
to
the
most
absolute
skill
in
the
small
sword
that
ever
i
saw
i
have
been
only
capable
of
restraining
him
by
representing
your
lordship
as
the
most
furious
and
impracticable
of
mankind
if
he
once
suspect
that
i
have
misrepresented
you
a
duel
in
which
i
am
afraid
your
lordship
would
be
overmatched
must
be
the
inevitable
consequence
might
i
therefore
presume
to
advise
your
lordship
should
make
use
of
the
advantage
i
have
gained
you
without
mercy
chapter
vi
some
specimens
of
the
evening
now
approached
in
which
the
scene
sir
william
twyford
had
with
so
much
pains
prepared
was
to
be
acted
an
imperfect
rumour
had
spread
that
something
extraordinary
was
to
pass
in
the
public
room
miss
prim
was
of
opinion
that
a
duel
would
be
fought
i
shall
be
frightened
out
of
my
wits
said
she
but
i
must
go
for
one
loves
any
thing
new
and
i
believe
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
a
modest
woman
may
not
see
miss
gawky
thought
it
would
be
a
boxing
match
bless
us
my
dear
lord
martin
could
stand
no
chance
with
that
great
lubberly
macaroni
but
miss
griskin
with
a
look
of
more
than
common
sagacity
assured
the
ladies
that
she
had
penetrated
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
matter
prettyman
and
lord
martin
have
ordered
two
large
rounds
of
beef
to
be
set
upon
the
table
at
supper
and
they
mean
to
lay
about
them
for
a
wager
in
this
manner
every
one
made
her
own
conjecture
which
she
preferred
to
that
of
all
the
rest
curiosity
was
wrought
up
to
the
highest
pitch
and
the
uncertainty
that
prevailed
upon
the
subject
rendered
the
affair
still
more
interesting
the
rooms
were
early
filled
with
an
uncommon
number
of
spectators
about
nine
prettyman
entered
but
instead
of
exerting
himself
with
his
usual
vivacity
he
retired
to
one
corner
of
the
room
and
sat
in
a
sheepish
and
melancholy
posture
not
long
after
sir
william
twyford
and
lord
martin
came
in
arm
in
arm
the
peer
strutted
immediately
to
the
upper
end
of
the
room
delia
stood
near
him
my
lovely
girl
said
he
with
an
air
of
vulgar
familiarity
i
am
rejoiced
to
see
you
i
hope
i
shall
one
day
prove
myself
worthy
of
your
favour
while
this
passed
prettyman
was
by
no
means
in
an
enviable
condition
from
the
operation
of
fear
and
vexation
he
perspired
very
profusely
vanity
as
we
have
said
might
almost
be
termed
his
ruling
passion
and
he
would
never
have
sacrificed
it
so
publicly
to
any
consideration
less
immediate
than
that
of
personal
safety
ardently
did
he
long
to
have
the
terrible
scene
concluded
but
he
had
neither
strength
nor
spirits
to
advance
a
step
or
even
to
rise
from
his
seat
sir
william
twyford
now
came
up
to
him
and
took
hold
of
his
hand
my
dear
friend
said
he
be
not
dispirited
it
is
no
more
than
a
and
it
will
be
over
in
a
moment
you
will
acquire
the
friendship
of
the
first
personage
in
the
county
and
far
from
losing
any
thing
in
the
public
esteem
you
will
be
more
respected
than
ever
cried
the
beau
my
shoulders
ake
for
it
already
but
très
cher
très
excellent
do
not
desert
me
and
remind
the
peer
of
the
generosity
you
talked
of
sir
william
now
raised
him
from
his
seat
and
led
him
to
the
middle
of
the
room
lord
martin
with
a
stately
air
advanced
a
few
steps
in
spite
however
of
all
the
heroism
he
could
assume
as
the
important
affair
drew
towards
a
crisis
he
began
to
tremble
prettyman
fell
upon
his
knees
and
sir
william
put
a
cane
into
his
hand
but
in
this
posture
the
beau
remained
still
somewhat
taller
than
his
antagonist
most
worthy
lord
cried
he
in
a
tremulous
voice
i
am
truly
sorry
for
the
misunderstanding
that
has
happened
and
i
am
filled
with
the
most
ardent
while
he
was
yet
speaking
he
advanced
the
cane
in
the
attitude
of
presenting
it
villain
said
lord
martin
who
between
fear
and
rage
could
no
longer
contain
himself
and
snatched
it
from
his
hand
but
he
could
scarcely
reach
beyond
the
shoulder
of
his
enemy
and
blinded
with
emotion
and
exertion
instead
of
directing
his
blows
as
he
ought
to
have
done
he
struck
him
two
or
three
very
severe
strokes
on
the
head
and
face
the
beau
bore
it
as
long
as
he
could
but
at
length
bellowing
out
dîeu
je
suis
i
am
beaten
to
a
jelly
he
rose
from
his
knees
his
antagonist
being
between
him
and
the
door
he
fairly
threw
him
upon
his
back
and
flying
out
of
the
room
he
stopped
not
till
he
arrived
at
the
inn
where
ordering
his
phaeton
and
six
he
ascended
without
a
pause
and
drove
off
for
london
in
the
mean
time
every
thing
in
the
public
room
was
in
confusion
and
disorder
sir
william
flew
to
support
the
discomfited
hero
who
had
received
a
grievous
contusion
in
his
shoulder
miss
griskin
giggled
the
other
ladies
screamed
and
miss
languish
as
usual
fainted
away
bless
me
cried
miss
fletcher
it
is
the
queerest
affair
by
my
troth
said
miss
gawky
it
is
vastly
fine
but
not
half
so
fine
cried
miss
griskin
as
the
buttocks
of
beef
by
this
time
lord
martin
had
raised
himself
in
a
sitting
posture
and
uttered
a
deep
groan
best
of
friends
said
he
pressing
the
hand
of
sir
william
tell
me
truly
am
i
victorious
or
am
i
defeated
oh
cried
sir
william
never
heed
a
slight
skin
wound
that
you
received
in
the
combat
his
lordship
stood
up
damnation
pox
confound
it
said
he
a
little
recovering
himself
what
is
become
of
the
rascal
i
have
not
given
him
half
what
he
deserved
but
ladies
added
he
flourishing
his
cane
it
is
my
maxim
as
i
am
strong
to
be
merciful
saying
this
he
advanced
towards
delia
and
with
a
flourish
of
importance
and
conceit
laid
the
weapon
which
he
had
so
roundly
employed
at
her
feet
loveliest
of
women
said
he
to
your
shrine
i
devote
myself
upon
your
altar
i
lay
the
insignia
of
my
prowess
deign
gentlest
of
thy
sex
to
accept
thus
publicly
of
those
sighs
which
i
have
long
poured
forth
upon
thy
account
delia
though
the
native
modesty
of
her
character
caused
her
whole
face
to
be
suffused
with
blushes
at
having
the
eyes
of
the
whole
company
thus
turned
upon
her
regarded
the
peer
with
a
look
of
ineffable
disdain
and
turned
from
him
in
silence
such
were
the
transactions
of
an
evening
which
will
doubtless
long
be
remembered
by
such
as
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
spectators
the
natural
impertinence
and
insolence
of
lord
martin
were
swelled
by
the
event
to
ten
times
their
natural
pitch
he
crowed
like
a
cock
and
cackled
like
a
goose
the
vulgar
of
the
other
sex
who
are
constantly
the
admirers
of
success
however
unmerited
and
conceit
however
unfounded
thought
his
lordship
the
greatest
man
in
the
world
the
inequality
of
his
legs
was
removed
by
the
proof
he
had
exhibited
of
his
prowess
the
inequality
of
his
shoulders
was
hid
under
a
of
ten
thousand
a
year
and
the
narrowness
of
his
intellects
the
optics
of
these
connoisseurs
were
not
calculated
to
discern
the
peer
as
we
have
already
hinted
was
the
suitor
most
favoured
by
the
father
of
our
heroine
the
principal
passion
of
the
old
gentleman
was
the
love
of
money
but
at
the
same
time
he
was
not
absolutely
incapable
of
relishing
the
inferior
charms
of
a
venerable
title
and
a
splendid
reputation
perceiving
that
his
client
continually
rose
in
the
public
opinion
he
was
more
eager
than
ever
to
have
the
match
concluded
lord
martin
though
his
organs
were
not
formed
to
delight
in
beauty
at
the
first
hand
was
yet
tickled
with
the
conceit
of
carrying
off
so
fair
a
prize
from
the
midst
of
a
thousand
gaping
expectants
it
will
naturally
be
imagined
that
the
situation
of
delia
at
this
moment
was
by
no
means
an
enviable
one
she
was
caught
in
the
snares
of
love
and
the
more
she
struggled
to
get
free
she
was
only
the
more
limed
and
entangled
the
recollection
of
the
hopelessness
of
her
love
by
no
means
sufficed
to
destroy
it
the
recollection
of
her
former
carelessness
and
gaiety
was
not
able
to
restore
her
to
present
ease
in
vain
she
summoned
pride
and
maiden
dignity
to
support
her
in
vain
she
formed
resolutions
which
were
broken
as
soon
as
made
every
where
she
was
haunted
by
the
image
of
her
dear
unknown
her
nights
were
sleepless
and
uneasy
the
fire
and
brightness
of
her
eyes
were
tarnished
pined
in
green
and
yellow
the
more
dear
were
the
ideal
image
that
accompanied
her
the
more
did
she
execrate
and
detest
her
persecutor
no
cried
she
i
will
never
be
his
never
shall
the
sacred
tie
which
should
only
unite
congenial
spirits
be
violated
by
two
souls
distant
as
the
poles
jarring
as
contending
elements
my
father
may
kill
me
alas
of
what
value
is
life
to
me
it
is
a
long
scene
of
unvaried
misfortune
it
is
a
dreary
vista
of
despair
he
may
kill
me
but
never
never
shall
he
force
me
to
a
deed
my
soul
abhors
chapter
vii
that
with
which
the
reader
will
be
acquainted
when
he
has
read
the
cup
of
misfortune
by
which
it
was
decreed
that
the
virtue
and
the
constancy
of
our
heroine
should
be
tried
was
not
yet
ended
the
disposition
of
a
melancholy
lover
is
in
the
utmost
degree
variable
now
the
fair
delia
studiously
sought
to
plunge
herself
in
impervious
solitude
and
now
worn
with
a
train
of
gloomy
reflections
she
with
equal
eagerness
solicited
the
society
of
her
favourite
companion
by
this
time
sir
william
twyford
and
miss
fletcher
were
become
in
a
manner
inseparable
of
consequence
the
company
of
the
one
necessarily
involved
that
of
the
other
and
the
gaiety
and
good
humour
of
sir
william
tempered
as
they
were
by
an
excellent
understanding
and
an
unaffected
vein
of
sportive
wit
were
the
sweetest
medicine
to
the
wounded
heart
of
delia
when
she
had
first
chosen
miss
fletcher
for
her
intimate
friend
her
own
faculties
had
not
yet
reached
their
maturity
and
habit
frequently
renders
the
most
insipid
amusements
pleasurable
and
interesting
southampton
itself
did
not
afford
the
largest
scope
for
selection
and
however
our
readers
may
decide
respecting
the
merit
of
the
easy
the
voluble
and
the
good
humoured
miss
fletcher
they
will
scarcely
be
disposed
to
deny
that
of
all
the
female
characters
we
have
hitherto
exhibited
she
was
the
most
amiable
one
evening
as
these
three
friends
were
sitting
together
sir
william
took
occasion
to
lament
the
necessity
that
was
laid
upon
him
to
quit
southampton
for
a
few
days
though
he
hoped
very
speedily
to
be
able
to
return
his
inamorata
as
usual
was
very
inquisitive
to
learn
the
business
that
was
to
deprive
her
for
a
time
of
the
presence
of
a
lover
of
whom
she
was
not
a
little
ostentatious
sir
william
answered
that
he
was
under
an
engagement
to
be
present
at
the
marriage
of
one
of
his
college
friends
and
that
he
should
set
out
in
company
with
moreland
at
that
name
our
tender
and
apprehensive
fair
one
involuntarily
started
mr
moreland
said
she
to
herself
ah
it
was
at
his
house
that
my
unknown
resided
it
is
very
seldom
that
moreland
undertakes
a
journey
surely
there
must
be
something
particularly
interesting
to
him
in
the
affair
the
strange
combination
of
circumstances
terrifies
and
perplexes
me
would
i
were
delivered
from
this
state
of
uncertainty
would
to
god
i
were
dead
the
uncertainty
which
afflicted
her
was
however
of
a
very
short
duration
miss
fletcher
by
an
inexhaustible
train
of
interrogatories
led
sir
william
to
relate
by
degrees
every
thing
he
knew
of
the
affair
the
young
gentleman
his
friend
was
the
nephew
and
heir
of
moreland
the
present
match
had
been
long
upon
the
carpet
and
was
a
very
considerable
one
in
point
of
fortune
did
the
nephew
ever
visit
mr
moreland
very
frequently
said
sir
william
and
he
is
visited
interposed
delia
by
other
young
gentlemen
from
the
university
no
answered
sir
william
moreland
who
is
an
old
batchelor
full
of
oddities
and
sensibility
has
a
general
dislike
of
young
collegians
he
thinks
them
pert
dissolute
arrogant
and
pedantic
he
therefore
never
receives
any
but
his
nephew
for
whom
he
has
the
most
ardent
affection
and
sometimes
by
particular
grace
myself
who
am
his
intimate
friend
and
how
long
is
it
since
the
young
gentleman
paid
a
visit
to
his
uncle
sir
william
looked
a
little
surprized
at
so
particular
a
question
but
answered
he
was
here
not
above
a
fortnight
ago
to
invite
his
uncle
to
the
wedding
but
he
is
rather
serious
and
thoughtful
in
his
temper
so
that
he
is
seldom
seen
in
public
it
was
now
but
too
certain
that
the
friend
of
sir
william
and
the
amiable
unknown
who
had
made
a
conquest
of
the
heart
of
delia
were
the
same
person
the
surprise
at
which
she
was
taken
and
the
unwelcome
manner
in
which
her
doubts
were
now
at
once
resolved
were
too
much
for
the
delicate
frame
of
our
heroine
she
sat
for
a
moment
gazing
with
an
eager
and
unmeaning
stare
upon
the
face
of
sir
william
but
she
presently
recollected
herself
and
bursting
out
of
the
room
flew
to
her
chamber
in
the
same
instant
and
was
relieved
by
a
flood
of
tears
sir
william
was
inexpressibly
surprised
at
this
incident
delia
he
was
sure
did
not
even
know
the
name
of
his
friend
and
he
could
scarcely
imagine
that
she
had
ever
seen
him
miss
fletcher
though
considerably
astonished
herself
gave
sir
william
an
account
of
so
many
particulars
of
what
had
passed
between
his
friend
and
our
heroine
as
were
perfectly
sufficient
to
solve
the
difficulty
in
return
the
baronet
explained
to
her
the
exact
situation
of
the
affair
of
damon
told
her
that
he
did
not
believe
the
day
was
yet
fixed
and
assured
her
that
moreland
and
himself
waited
for
a
farther
summons
though
it
must
be
confessed
that
it
was
expected
every
hour
these
particulars
when
communicated
to
delia
by
the
indefatigable
assiduity
of
miss
fletcher
afforded
her
but
a
very
slender
consolation
what
avails
it
me
said
she
that
the
day
is
not
fixed
every
considerable
circumstance
there
is
reason
to
believe
is
determined
he
marries
with
the
approbation
of
all
his
friends
a
lady
my
superior
in
rank
and
fortune
and
who
is
probably
every
way
worthy
of
him
ah
why
am
i
thus
selfish
and
envious
no
let
me
pine
away
in
obscurity
let
me
be
forgotten
but
may
he
live
long
and
happy
did
he
not
tell
me
that
he
went
to
seek
the
of
his
and
yet
interrupted
she
he
accompanied
the
information
with
words
of
such
sweet
import
with
so
much
tenderness
and
gentleness
as
will
never
be
erased
from
my
mind
ah
foolish
girl
wilt
thou
for
ever
delude
thyself
wilt
thou
be
for
ever
extracting
comfort
from
despair
no
long
enough
hast
thou
been
misguided
by
the
meteor
of
hope
long
enough
hast
thou
been
cheated
by
the
visions
of
youthful
fancy
there
is
now
no
remedy
left
let
me
die
there
were
two
passions
that
predominated
in
the
breast
of
sir
william
twyford
the
first
was
that
of
a
humourist
and
to
this
almost
every
other
object
was
occasionally
sacrificed
but
he
had
likewise
a
large
fund
of
good
nature
he
perceived
that
in
two
successive
instances
however
unintentionally
his
conduct
had
been
the
source
of
unhappiness
to
the
most
amiable
of
her
sex
the
victory
of
lord
martin
had
put
it
more
than
ever
in
his
power
to
harrass
delia
she
was
incessantly
importuned
now
by
her
father
and
now
by
her
inamorato
and
her
distress
if
it
had
wanted
any
addition
was
rendered
compleat
by
the
expected
marriage
of
one
whose
personal
accomplishments
had
caught
her
unwary
heart
he
lamented
the
undeserved
misfortune
of
youth
and
beauty
his
heart
bled
for
her
thus
circumstanced
his
active
benevolence
determined
him
not
to
lose
a
moment
in
endeavouring
to
repair
the
mischief
of
which
he
had
so
unfortunately
been
the
author
he
had
never
cordially
approved
of
the
intended
union
between
his
friend
and
miss
frampton
she
was
of
the
first
order
of
coquettes
and
it
might
have
puzzled
even
an
anatomist
to
determine
whether
she
had
a
heart
descartes
informs
us
that
the
soul
usually
resides
in
the
pineal
gland
but
the
soul
of
this
lady
seemed
to
inhabit
in
her
eyes
she
had
been
caught
with
the
figure
of
damon
and
had
a
figure
more
perfectly
beautiful
if
that
had
been
possible
or
an
equipage
more
brilliant
presented
itself
he
did
not
doubt
but
that
it
would
carry
away
the
prize
miss
frampton
was
heiress
to
a
fortune
of
fifty
thousand
pounds
the
father
of
damon
whose
soul
in
union
with
some
amiable
qualities
which
served
him
for
a
disguise
had
the
misfortune
to
be
exceedingly
mercenary
at
the
bottom
had
proposed
the
match
to
his
son
damon
who
had
never
in
his
life
been
guilty
of
an
act
of
disobedience
received
the
recommendation
of
his
father
with
a
prejudice
in
its
favour
he
waited
upon
the
young
lady
and
found
her
beautiful
high
spirited
accomplished
and
incensed
by
a
thousand
worshippers
her
disposition
was
not
indeed
congenial
to
his
own
but
he
was
prejudiced
by
filial
duty
dazzled
by
her
charms
and
led
on
insensibly
by
the
mildness
and
pliableness
of
his
character
in
a
word
every
thing
had
been
concluded
and
the
wedding
was
daily
expected
to
take
place
chapter
viii
persons
of
in
pursuance
of
the
determination
he
had
formed
sir
william
immediately
set
out
for
oxford
where
his
friend
still
resided
as
he
had
lived
with
him
upon
terms
of
the
most
unreserved
familiarity
he
made
use
of
the
liberty
of
an
intimate
and
without
being
announced
abruptly
entered
his
chamber
damon
was
sitting
in
a
melancholy
posture
his
countenance
dejected
and
his
eye
languid
upon
the
entrance
of
the
baronet
he
looked
up
and
struck
with
the
sudden
appearance
of
one
to
whom
he
was
so
ardently
attached
his
visage
for
a
moment
assumed
an
air
of
gaiety
and
pleasure
ha
cried
sir
william
with
his
wonted
spriteliness
of
accent
methinks
the
countenance
of
my
damon
does
not
bespeak
the
sentiments
that
become
a
bridegroom
i
am
afraid
not
answered
damon
but
tell
me
to
what
am
i
indebted
for
this
agreeable
and
unexpected
visit
we
will
talk
of
that
another
time
but
when
did
you
see
my
miss
frampton
i
have
not
seen
her
replied
our
hero
with
a
sigh
half
uttered
and
half
suppressed
these
ten
days
what
cried
the
baronet
no
misunderstanding
eh
not
absolutely
that
i
saw
her
i
fear
without
all
the
rapture
that
becomes
a
lover
and
she
resented
it
with
a
coldness
that
did
not
introduce
an
immediate
explanation
since
that
time
i
have
been
somewhat
indisposed
or
probably
affairs
would
now
have
been
settled
and
what
said
sir
william
must
we
apply
the
old
maxim
that
the
falling
out
of
lovers
is
the
consolidating
of
love
damon
from
the
entrance
of
his
friend
had
appeared
a
good
deal
agitated
he
was
no
longer
able
to
contain
himself
he
eagerly
seized
the
hand
of
sir
william
and
clasped
it
between
both
of
his
my
dear
baronet
i
have
never
concealed
from
you
a
thought
of
my
heart
but
my
present
situation
is
so
peculiarly
delicate
and
distressing
that
i
can
scarcely
form
any
sentiment
of
it
or
even
dare
trust
myself
to
recollect
it
i
have
seen
continued
he
ah
that
i
could
forget
it
a
woman
beauteous
as
the
day
before
whom
the
charms
of
miss
frampton
disappear
as
before
the
rising
sun
each
little
star
its
diminish
her
features
full
of
sensibility
her
voice
such
as
to
thrill
the
soul
and
all
she
says
pervaded
with
wit
and
good
sense
and
where
cried
the
baronet
in
a
lively
tone
resides
this
peerless
she
alas
answered
the
disconsolate
damon
it
matters
not
i
shall
see
her
no
more
virtue
honour
every
thing
forbids
it
i
may
be
unhappy
but
i
will
never
deserve
to
be
so
miss
frampton
has
my
vows
filial
duty
calls
on
me
to
fulfil
them
obstacles
without
number
alps
on
alps
arise
to
impede
my
prosecution
of
a
fond
and
unlicensed
inclination
the
struggle
has
cost
me
something
but
it
is
over
i
have
recovered
my
health
i
have
formed
my
resolution
this
very
day
you
my
good
friend
will
accept
the
apology
i
had
determined
to
repair
to
beaufort
place
doubt
and
uncertainty
nourish
the
lingering
distemper
that
would
undo
me
i
will
come
to
a
decision
sir
william
was
not
of
a
temper
to
abdicate
any
affair
in
which
he
had
embarked
before
success
appeared
absolutely
unattainable
like
caesar
it
was
enough
for
him
that
the
thing
appeared
possible
to
be
done
to
engage
him
to
persevere
he
therefore
begged
leave
to
accompany
his
friend
and
they
set
out
together
that
very
afternoon
beaufort
place
the
habitation
of
miss
frampton
was
only
six
miles
from
oxford
and
as
he
knew
that
sir
harry
eustace
the
son
of
that
mother
by
a
second
husband
was
now
upon
a
visit
to
his
sister
sir
william
twyford
made
no
scruple
of
proceeding
with
his
friend
immediately
to
the
house
after
a
short
general
conversation
sir
william
drew
the
young
baronet
into
the
garden
in
the
mean
time
sir
harry
chariot
was
preparing
as
he
had
fixed
the
conclusion
of
his
visit
for
that
evening
after
an
interval
of
half
an
hour
the
servant
brought
word
that
the
carriage
was
ready
sir
harry
who
was
a
young
man
of
little
ceremony
bowed
before
the
parlour
window
and
immediately
hurried
away
sir
william
stood
for
some
time
at
the
door
of
the
house
after
sir
harry
had
driven
away
presently
he
observed
another
carriage
advancing
by
the
opposite
road
the
liveries
were
flaunting
and
the
attendants
numerous
they
drew
nearer
and
he
perceived
that
it
was
the
equipage
of
lord
osborne
since
therefore
the
lovers
were
to
be
so
soon
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
new
visitant
he
thought
proper
immediately
to
enter
the
parlour
he
had
only
time
to
remark
the
air
and
countenance
of
damon
and
the
young
lady
they
appeared
mutually
cold
and
embarassed
he
could
trace
in
his
friend
the
aukwardness
and
timidity
of
one
who
was
unused
to
act
a
studied
part
miss
frampton
with
a
countenance
uninterested
and
inattentive
affected
the
carriage
of
a
person
who
thought
herself
insulted
lord
osborne
was
now
announced
he
was
a
young
nobleman
that
had
spent
a
considerable
part
of
his
fortune
upon
the
continent
with
a
narrow
understanding
and
a
contracted
heart
he
had
been
able
by
habitual
cunning
and
invincible
effrontery
to
acquire
the
reputation
of
a
man
of
parts
courage
was
the
only
respectable
quality
his
possession
of
which
could
not
be
questioned
he
was
a
debauchee
and
a
gamester
there
was
no
meanness
he
had
not
practised
there
was
no
villainy
of
which
he
could
not
boast
with
this
character
he
was
universally
respected
and
courted
by
all
such
as
wished
to
acquire
the
reputation
of
men
of
gaiety
and
spirit
the
ladies
were
all
dying
for
him
as
for
a
man
who
had
ruined
more
innocence
and
occasioned
a
greater
consumption
of
misery
than
any
other
man
in
the
kingdom
the
face
of
miss
frampton
visibly
brightened
the
moment
his
name
was
articulated
she
was
all
spirits
and
agitation
though
she
seemed
to
feel
something
aukward
in
her
situation
when
he
entered
the
room
she
flew
half
way
to
meet
him
but
suddenly
recollecting
herself
stopt
short
my
dear
miss
frampton
said
his
lordship
with
a
familiar
and
indifferent
air
i
can
not
stop
a
moment
i
am
mortified
to
death
the
most
unfortunate
man
but
i
could
not
live
a
whole
day
without
seeing
you
believe
me
to
be
more
impassioned
more
ardent
than
ever
saying
this
be
directed
a
slight
glance
and
a
half
bow
towards
our
two
friends
farewel
my
charmer
my
adorable
said
he
and
kissed
her
hand
miss
frampton
struck
him
a
slight
blow
with
her
fan
and
crying
with
an
easy
wink
remember
she
dropt
him
a
profound
curtesey
and
his
lordship
departed
for
a
moment
the
whole
company
was
silent
by
my
soul
exclaimed
sir
william
this
is
the
most
singular
affair
oh
nothing
at
all
answered
the
young
lady
it
is
all
la
mode
de
in
france
no
man
of
fashion
can
presume
to
accost
a
lady
whether
young
or
old
but
in
the
language
of
love
but
it
means
no
more
than
when
a
minister
of
state
says
to
his
first
clerk
humble
or
to
the
widow
of
a
poor
seaman
devoted
oh
cried
sir
william
that
is
all
and
by
my
faith
it
is
mighty
pretty
what
think
you
damon
i
hope
when
you
are
married
you
will
have
no
objection
to
lord
osborne
or
any
other
person
of
fashion
making
love
to
your
wife
before
your
face
what
an
indelicate
question
said
miss
frampton
i
declare
baronet
you
are
grown
an
absolute
boor
nobody
ever
talks
of
marriage
now
a
woman
of
fashion
blushes
to
hear
it
mentioned
before
a
third
person
why
to
say
the
truth
madam
i
have
been
honoured
with
so
great
an
intimacy
by
damon
that
i
thought
that
might
excuse
the
impropriety
and
now
pray
your
ladyship
must
i
wait
till
we
are
alone
before
i
ask
my
friend
whether
his
happy
day
be
fixed
since
you
will
talk
said
miss
frampton
of
the
odious
subject
i
believe
i
may
tell
you
that
it
is
not
we
are
in
no
such
hurry
my
dear
sweet
said
the
baronet
i
must
tell
you
once
for
all
that
i
am
no
adept
in
french
fashions
so
that
you
will
give
me
leave
to
use
the
unceremonious
language
of
an
englishman
my
friend
here
you
know
is
a
little
sheepish
but
i
have
words
at
will
i
thought
matters
had
been
nearer
a
termination
and
pray
my
good
sir
let
the
gentleman
speak
for
himself
if
he
is
not
dissatisfied
why
should
you
be
in
such
haste
indeed
madam
interposed
damon
i
am
not
perfectly
satisfied
perhaps
indeed
a
lover
ought
to
think
himself
happy
enough
in
being
permitted
to
dance
attendance
upon
a
lady
of
your
charms
but
i
once
thought
madam
that
we
had
advanced
somewhat
farther
i
can
not
tell
answered
the
lady
with
an
air
of
levity
just
as
you
please
but
i
can
not
see
why
we
should
put
ourselves
to
any
inconvenience
lord
osborne
lord
osborne
interrupted
sir
william
with
some
warmth
and
pray
what
has
his
lordship
to
do
with
the
matter
really
sir
william
replied
miss
frampton
you
are
very
free
but
his
lordship
is
my
friend
and
i
hope
damon
has
no
objection
to
his
continuing
so
look
you
answered
sir
william
i
would
neither
have
lord
osborne
for
the
rival
of
damon
now
nor
for
your
hereafter
and
yet
i
am
not
sure
cried
she
that
he
may
not
be
both
is
there
then
said
the
baronet
no
engagement
subsisting
between
you
and
damon
i
believe
cried
miss
frampton
a
little
hesitating
there
may
be
something
of
the
kind
but
we
may
change
our
minds
you
know
and
i
do
not
think
that
i
shall
prosecute
upon
it
ha
ha
ha
to
say
the
truth
replied
sir
william
i
believe
lord
osborne
is
not
only
the
rival
of
damon
but
a
very
formidable
one
too
but
let
me
tell
you
bella
a
character
so
respectable
as
that
of
my
friend
and
so
true
an
englishman
must
not
be
allowed
to
dance
attendance
as
he
pleases
i
believe
we
understand
one
another
and
to
say
the
truth
at
once
perhaps
some
time
hence
i
may
have
no
aversion
to
lord
osborne
the
reader
will
not
suppose
that
the
conversation
continued
much
longer
damon
and
the
young
lady
came
to
a
perfect
understanding
and
parted
without
any
very
ungovernable
desire
of
seeing
each
other
again
and
thus
by
the
gay
humour
and
active
friendship
of
sir
william
twyford
an
affair
was
happily
terminated
which
from
the
timidity
and
gentleness
of
our
hero
might
otherwise
have
lingered
several
months
to
the
mutual
dissatisfaction
of
both
parties
damon
quitted
the
house
in
raptures
and
was
no
sooner
seated
in
the
chariot
than
he
pressed
his
friend
repeatedly
to
his
breast
and
committed
a
thousand
extravagancies
of
joy
chapter
ix
tragical
damon
and
his
friend
spent
the
evening
together
in
the
chambers
of
our
hero
they
now
discussed
a
variety
of
those
subjects
which
naturally
arise
between
friends
who
have
been
for
any
time
separated
damon
threw
aside
that
reserve
which
the
consciousness
of
a
fault
had
hitherto
involuntarily
imposed
upon
him
and
related
more
explicitly
who
the
lady
was
of
whom
he
was
so
much
enamoured
and
in
what
manner
he
had
first
seen
her
recollecting
that
the
baronet
was
just
returned
from
the
environs
of
southampton
he
eagerly
enquired
into
the
health
and
situation
of
his
mistress
sir
william
related
to
him
the
adventure
of
prettyman
as
we
have
already
stated
it
to
our
readers
and
deeply
lamented
the
persecution
to
which
delia
was
subjected
from
the
haughty
victor
and
is
there
cried
damon
eagerly
no
prospect
of
his
lordship
success
i
believe
answered
sir
william
that
he
is
of
all
men
her
mortal
aversion
and
is
there
no
happy
lover
in
all
her
train
that
she
regards
with
a
partial
eye
none
replied
the
baronet
she
is
chaste
as
snow
and
firm
as
mountain
oaks
propitious
coldness
exclaimed
damon
for
that
may
heaven
send
down
a
thousand
blessings
on
her
head
but
you
talked
added
he
of
some
occasion
of
your
journey
which
you
deferred
relating
to
me
the
occasion
answered
sir
william
determined
to
preserve
inviolate
the
secret
of
delia
is
already
fulfilled
i
heard
from
young
eustace
of
the
appearance
and
addresses
of
osborne
and
suspecting
the
rest
i
determined
to
deliver
you
from
the
clutches
of
a
girl
whom
i
always
thought
unworthy
of
you
and
now
added
he
cheerfully
free
as
the
winds
we
can
pursue
uncontrolled
the
devices
of
our
own
hearts
the
next
morning
the
two
friends
proceeded
to
the
house
of
lord
thomas
villiers
the
father
of
damon
he
had
already
learned
something
of
the
visits
of
lord
osborne
at
beaufort
place
he
was
not
therefore
much
surprised
to
hear
of
the
scene
which
had
passed
between
his
son
and
the
lady
of
that
mansion
but
there
was
something
more
to
be
done
in
order
to
gain
the
approbation
of
the
father
to
the
new
project
in
the
prosecution
of
which
both
these
friends
were
equally
sanguine
lord
thomas
villiers
was
as
we
have
already
said
avaricious
he
was
not
therefore
much
pleased
with
the
proposal
of
a
match
with
a
lady
whose
fortune
was
not
the
half
of
that
of
miss
frampton
he
was
tinctured
with
the
pride
of
family
and
he
could
not
patiently
think
for
a
moment
of
marrying
his
only
son
to
the
daughter
of
a
tradesman
sir
william
employed
all
his
eloquence
and
accommodated
himself
with
infinite
dexterity
to
the
humours
of
the
person
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
damon
indeed
said
but
little
but
his
looks
expressed
more
than
the
baronet
with
all
his
abilities
and
all
his
friendship
was
able
to
suggest
in
spite
of
both
the
father
continued
inexorable
the
mind
of
damon
was
impressed
with
the
most
exalted
ideas
upon
the
subject
of
filial
duty
had
his
heart
been
before
the
affair
of
miss
frampton
was
proposed
to
him
he
might
not
perhaps
have
carried
his
complaisance
so
far
as
to
have
married
the
indifferent
person
in
spite
of
all
his
views
and
all
his
prepossessions
but
in
his
estimate
the
actual
entering
into
a
connection
for
life
in
opposition
to
the
will
of
a
parent
was
a
mode
of
conduct
very
different
from
and
far
more
exceptionable
than
the
refusing
to
unite
oneself
with
a
person
in
whose
society
one
had
not
the
smallest
reason
to
look
for
happiness
there
was
another
inducement
that
had
much
weight
with
damon
and
even
with
his
more
sanguine
friend
sir
william
twyford
the
fortune
neither
of
damon
nor
delia
was
independent
lord
thomas
villiers
was
filled
with
too
many
prepossessions
and
too
much
pride
easily
to
retract
an
opinion
he
had
once
adopted
or
to
forgive
an
opposition
to
his
judgment
the
narrow
education
of
a
tradesman
it
was
natural
to
suppose
had
rendered
the
mind
of
hartley
still
more
tenacious
and
unmanageable
and
neither
would
sir
william
have
been
willing
to
see
his
friend
nor
would
the
lover
readily
have
involved
his
mistress
in
circumstances
of
pecuniary
distress
the
resolution
of
damon
was
therefore
speedily
taken
every
motive
that
could
have
weight
served
to
counteract
the
bias
of
his
inclination
he
by
no
means
wanted
either
firmness
or
spirit
he
resolved
to
struggle
nor
to
cease
his
efforts
till
he
had
conquered
with
this
design
he
entreated
and
after
some
difficulties
obtained
of
his
father
leave
to
enter
himself
in
the
army
and
to
make
a
campaign
in
america
the
character
of
his
heart
seemed
particularly
formed
for
military
pursuits
he
was
grave
and
thoughtful
he
was
generous
and
humane
to
a
mind
contemplative
and
full
of
sensibility
he
united
a
temper
frank
open
and
undisguised
he
was
usually
mild
gentle
and
pliant
but
in
a
situation
that
called
for
determination
and
spirit
it
was
impossible
to
appear
more
bold
and
manly
more
cool
and
decided
affectionate
was
the
farewel
of
his
father
and
still
more
affectionate
that
of
his
friend
damon
though
he
endeavoured
to
summon
all
his
resolution
could
not
restrain
a
sigh
when
he
considered
himself
as
about
to
sail
for
distant
climates
and
recollected
that
probably
before
his
return
his
beloved
mistress
than
life
and
all
its
would
be
united
irrevocably
united
to
another
but
here
we
must
take
leave
of
our
hero
and
return
to
his
fair
inamorata
damon
and
delia
part
the
second
damon
and
delia
part
the
second
chapter
i
which
the
story
begins
over
sir
william
twyford
had
taken
care
to
inform
miss
fletcher
and
by
her
means
delia
herself
of
every
circumstance
as
it
occurred
delia
was
indeed
flattered
by
the
breach
that
had
taken
place
with
miss
frampton
and
the
perfect
elucidation
which
the
story
of
this
lady
afforded
to
the
most
enigmatical
expressions
of
damon
in
the
interesting
scene
that
had
passed
between
them
in
the
alcove
she
no
longer
doubted
of
the
reality
of
his
attachment
her
heart
was
soothed
and
her
pride
secretly
flattered
in
recollecting
that
she
had
not
suffered
herself
to
be
caught
by
one
who
was
perfectly
indifferent
to
her
but
the
information
that
stifled
all
her
hopes
and
gave
her
the
prospect
of
so
long
and
too
probably
an
eternal
absence
sat
heavy
upon
her
spirits
and
preyed
upon
her
delicate
constitution
from
the
persecutions
of
lord
martin
she
had
no
respite
her
eye
grew
languid
the
colour
faded
in
her
damask
cheek
and
her
health
visibly
decayed
at
this
time
miss
fletcher
proposed
a
journey
to
windsor
and
other
places
and
intreated
to
have
her
friend
to
accompany
her
hartley
with
all
his
foibles
was
much
attached
to
his
only
child
and
deeply
afflicted
with
the
alteration
he
perceived
in
her
he
readily
therefore
gave
his
consent
to
the
proposed
jaunt
when
she
returns
it
will
be
time
enough
said
he
to
lord
martin
to
bring
things
to
the
conclusion
so
much
desired
by
both
of
us
i
will
not
put
my
darling
into
your
hands
but
with
that
health
and
gaiety
which
have
so
long
been
the
solace
of
my
old
age
and
which
can
not
fail
to
make
any
man
happy
that
deserves
her
delia
set
out
without
any
other
inclination
than
to
escape
from
intreaties
that
were
become
in
the
highest
degree
disagreeable
to
her
she
was
addressed
no
longer
upon
a
topic
of
which
she
wished
never
to
hear
her
eye
was
no
longer
wounded
with
the
sight
of
her
insolent
admirer
this
had
an
immediate
and
a
favourable
effect
upon
her
the
conversation
of
miss
fletcher
was
lively
and
unflagging
and
the
simplicity
of
her
remarks
proved
an
inexhaustible
source
of
entertainment
to
our
heroine
they
travelled
leisurely
and
visited
a
variety
of
parks
and
seats
of
noblemen
which
lay
in
their
way
the
taste
of
delia
was
delicate
and
refined
a
continual
succession
of
objects
gardens
architecture
pictures
and
statues
soothed
her
spirits
and
gradually
restored
her
to
that
gaiety
and
easiness
of
temper
which
had
long
rendered
her
the
most
lovely
and
engaging
of
her
sex
at
length
they
arrived
at
windsor
the
simple
dignity
of
the
castle
its
commanding
situation
and
the
beautiful
effects
of
the
river
from
below
rendered
it
infinitely
the
most
charming
spot
our
heroine
had
yet
seen
her
spirits
were
on
the
wing
she
was
all
life
and
conversation
and
the
most
constant
heart
that
nature
had
ever
produced
for
a
moment
forgot
her
hopes
her
fears
her
inclinations
and
her
damon
she
was
now
standing
at
a
window
that
commanded
the
terrace
the
evening
was
beautiful
and
the
walk
crouded
there
were
assembled
persons
of
all
sexes
and
of
different
ranks
all
appeared
gaiety
and
splendour
the
supple
courtier
and
the
haughty
country
gentleman
seemed
equally
at
their
ease
there
was
thoughtless
youth
and
narrative
old
age
the
company
passed
along
and
object
succeeded
object
without
intermission
one
of
the
last
that
caught
the
eye
of
delia
was
that
of
two
gentlemen
walking
arm
in
arm
and
seeming
more
grave
than
the
rest
of
the
company
they
were
both
tall
and
well
shaped
but
one
of
them
had
somewhat
more
graceful
and
unembarrassed
in
his
manner
than
the
other
the
latter
was
dressed
in
black
the
former
in
colours
with
much
propriety
and
elegance
as
they
turned
at
the
end
of
the
walk
the
eye
of
delia
caught
in
the
latter
the
figure
of
damon
she
was
inexpressibly
astonished
she
trembled
in
every
limb
and
could
scarcely
support
herself
to
a
seat
miss
fletcher
had
caught
the
same
object
at
the
same
moment
and
though
she
probably
might
not
otherwise
have
been
clear
in
her
recollection
the
disorder
of
delia
put
her
conjecture
out
of
doubt
she
therefore
before
our
heroine
had
time
to
recollect
herself
dispatched
her
brother
who
had
attended
them
in
their
journey
to
inform
damon
that
a
lady
in
the
castle
was
desirous
to
speak
with
him
in
an
instant
our
hero
and
his
companion
escorted
by
young
fletcher
entered
the
room
the
astonishment
of
damon
at
being
so
suddenly
introduced
to
a
person
whom
he
had
never
expected
to
see
again
was
immeasurable
he
rushed
forward
with
a
kind
of
rapture
he
suddenly
recollected
himself
but
at
length
advanced
with
hesitation
there
was
no
one
present
beside
those
we
have
already
named
the
castle
was
probably
familiar
to
every
person
except
delia
and
her
companions
every
one
beside
was
therefore
assembled
upon
the
terrace
our
heroine
now
gradually
recovered
from
the
disorder
into
which
the
unexpected
sight
of
damon
had
thrown
her
she
was
much
surprised
at
looking
up
to
find
him
in
her
presence
how
is
this
cried
she
how
came
you
hither
the
meeting
said
our
hero
is
equally
unexpected
to
us
both
but
ah
my
charmer
whence
this
disorder
why
did
you
tremble
why
look
so
pale
oh
goodness
cried
miss
fletcher
what
should
it
be
why
it
was
nothing
in
all
the
world
but
her
seeing
you
just
now
from
the
window
and
were
you
cried
damon
eagerly
so
kind
as
to
summon
me
to
your
presence
no
no
my
good
sir
said
the
lively
lady
you
must
thank
me
for
that
how
then
at
least
said
the
lover
must
i
interpret
your
disorder
delia
was
inexpressibly
confused
at
the
inconsiderate
language
of
her
companion
i
can
not
tell
said
she
you
must
not
ask
me
you
must
forget
it
and
can
i
cried
damon
with
transport
ever
forget
a
disorder
so
propitious
so
flattering
can
i
hope
that
the
heart
of
my
charmer
is
not
indifferent
to
her
damon
oh
sir
be
silent
do
not
use
a
language
like
this
alas
cried
he
too
long
has
my
passion
been
suppressed
too
long
have
i
been
obliged
to
act
a
studied
part
and
employ
a
language
foreign
to
my
heart
i
thought
answered
delia
with
hesitation
that
you
were
going
to
leave
the
kingdom
and
did
my
fair
one
condescend
to
employ
a
thought
upon
me
did
she
interest
herself
in
my
concern
and
enquire
after
my
welfare
and
how
so
soon
could
she
have
learned
my
intention
this
question
joined
with
the
preceding
circumstances
completed
the
confusion
of
delia
she
blushed
stammered
and
was
silent
damon
during
this
interval
gazed
upon
her
with
unmingled
rapture
every
symptom
she
betrayed
of
confusion
was
to
him
a
symptom
of
something
inexpressibly
soothing
ah
whispered
he
to
himself
i
am
beloved
and
can
i
then
leave
the
kingdom
can
i
quit
this
inestimable
treasure
can
i
slight
so
pure
a
friendship
and
throw
away
the
jewel
upon
which
all
my
future
happiness
depends
the
conversation
from
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
the
lovers
had
so
immediately
become
interesting
that
the
gentlemen
had
not
had
an
opportunity
of
quitting
them
during
the
short
silence
that
prevailed
the
friend
of
damon
took
young
fletcher
by
the
hand
and
led
him
into
the
garden
the
lovers
were
now
under
less
restraint
delia
perceiving
that
she
could
no
longer
conceal
her
sentiments
confessed
them
with
ingenuous
modesty
damon
on
the
other
hand
was
ravished
at
so
unexpected
a
discovery
and
in
a
few
minutes
had
lived
an
age
in
love
he
now
began
to
recollect
himself
where
said
he
are
all
my
resolutions
what
are
become
of
all
the
plans
i
had
formed
and
the
designs
in
which
i
had
embarked
what
an
unexpected
revolution
no
said
he
addressing
himself
to
delia
i
will
never
quit
you
do
thou
but
smile
and
let
all
the
world
beside
abandon
me
can
you
forgive
the
sacrilegious
intention
of
deserting
you
of
flying
from
you
to
the
extremities
of
the
globe
oh
had
i
known
a
thought
of
damon
had
harboured
in
one
corner
of
your
heart
i
would
sooner
have
died
and
do
you
think
cried
delia
that
i
will
tempt
you
to
disobedience
no
obey
the
precepts
of
your
father
and
your
own
better
thoughts
heaven
designed
us
not
for
each
other
neither
your
friends
nor
mine
can
ever
be
reconciled
to
the
union
go
then
and
forget
me
go
and
be
happy
may
your
sails
be
swelled
with
propitious
gales
may
victory
and
renown
attend
your
steps
ah
cruel
delia
and
do
you
wish
to
banish
me
do
you
enjoin
upon
me
the
impracticable
talk
to
forget
all
that
my
heart
holds
dear
and
will
my
delia
resign
herself
to
the
arms
of
a
more
favoured
lover
never
cried
she
with
warmth
i
will
not
disobey
my
father
i
will
not
marry
contrary
to
his
inclinations
but
even
the
authority
of
a
parent
shall
not
drag
me
to
the
altar
with
a
man
my
soul
detests
propitious
sounds
generous
engagements
thus
let
me
thank
thee
and
he
kissed
her
hand
with
fervour
thus
far
cried
delia
i
can
advance
i
employ
no
disguise
i
confess
to
you
all
my
weakness
perhaps
i
ought
to
blush
but
never
will
i
have
this
reason
to
blush
for
that
my
love
has
injured
the
object
it
aspires
to
bless
go
in
the
path
of
fortune
deserve
success
and
happiness
by
the
exemplariness
of
your
duty
and
may
heaven
shower
down
blessings
without
number
chapter
ii
history
of
in
expostulations
like
these
our
lovers
spent
their
time
without
coming
to
any
conclusion
till
the
evening
and
miss
fletcher
warned
them
that
it
was
time
to
depart
damon
was
to
proceed
for
london
early
the
next
morning
he
therefore
intreated
of
delia
to
permit
his
friend
godfrey
who
was
obliged
to
continue
in
the
place
some
days
longer
to
wait
upon
her
with
his
last
commands
he
informed
himself
of
the
time
when
she
was
to
return
to
southampton
and
he
trusted
to
be
there
not
long
after
her
in
the
mean
time
as
his
situation
was
at
present
very
precarious
he
prevailed
upon
her
to
permit
him
to
write
to
her
from
time
to
time
and
to
promise
to
communicate
to
him
in
return
any
thing
of
consequence
that
might
happen
to
herself
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
miss
fletcher
made
several
ingenious
observations
upon
what
had
passed
delia
gently
blamed
her
for
having
so
strangely
occasioned
the
interview
though
in
reality
she
was
by
no
means
displeased
by
the
event
it
had
produced
bless
us
child
you
are
as
captious
as
any
thing
why
i
would
not
but
have
seen
it
for
ever
so
much
well
he
is
a
sweet
dear
man
and
so
kind
and
so
polite
for
all
the
world
i
think
him
just
such
another
as
prattle
but
then
he
is
grave
and
makes
such
fine
speeches
it
does
one
heart
good
to
hear
him
i
vow
i
wish
i
had
such
a
lover
sir
william
never
says
any
thing
half
so
pretty
bless
us
my
dear
talks
about
love
just
as
if
he
were
talking
about
any
thing
else
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
godfrey
appeared
he
brought
from
damon
a
thousand
vows
full
of
passion
and
constancy
he
had
parted
he
said
more
determined
not
to
leave
england
more
resolute
to
prosecute
his
love
than
ever
having
discharged
his
commission
he
offered
his
service
to
escort
the
ladies
in
any
party
they
might
propose
for
the
present
day
he
said
that
being
perfectly
acquainted
with
windsor
and
its
environs
he
flattered
himself
he
might
be
able
to
contribute
to
their
entertainment
the
very
gallant
manner
in
which
this
offer
was
made
determined
miss
fletcher
as
something
singular
and
interesting
in
the
appearance
of
godfrey
did
our
heroine
cheerfully
to
close
with
the
proposal
the
person
of
godfrey
as
we
have
already
said
was
tall
and
genteel
there
was
a
diffidence
in
his
manner
that
seemed
to
prove
that
he
had
not
possessed
the
most
extensive
acquaintance
with
high
life
but
he
had
a
natural
politeness
that
amply
compensated
for
the
polish
and
forms
of
society
his
air
was
serious
and
somewhat
melancholy
but
there
was
a
fire
and
animation
in
his
eye
that
was
in
the
highest
degree
striking
delia
engaged
him
to
talk
of
the
character
and
qualities
of
damon
upon
this
subject
godfrey
spoke
with
the
warmth
of
an
honest
friendship
he
represented
damon
as
of
a
disposition
perfectly
singular
and
unaccommodated
to
what
he
stiled
the
debauched
and
unfeeling
manners
of
the
age
he
acknowledged
with
readiness
and
gratitude
that
he
owed
to
him
the
most
important
obligations
by
degrees
delia
collected
from
him
several
circumstances
of
a
story
which
she
before
apprehended
to
be
interesting
she
observed
that
as
he
shook
off
the
embarrassment
of
a
first
introduction
his
language
became
fluent
elegant
pointed
and
even
sometimes
poetical
since
however
he
related
his
own
story
imperfectly
and
by
piece
meal
we
shall
beg
leave
to
state
it
in
our
own
manner
and
we
the
rather
do
it
as
we
apprehend
it
to
be
interesting
in
itself
and
as
we
foresee
that
he
will
make
a
second
appearance
in
the
course
of
this
narrative
we
will
not
however
deprive
our
readers
of
the
reflections
he
threw
out
upon
the
several
situations
in
which
he
had
been
placed
we
will
give
them
without
pretending
to
decide
how
far
they
may
be
considered
as
just
and
godfrey
was
not
born
to
affluent
circumstances
at
a
proper
age
he
had
been
placed
at
the
university
of
oxford
and
here
it
was
that
he
commenced
his
acquaintance
with
damon
at
oxford
his
abilities
had
been
universally
admired
his
public
exercises
though
public
exercises
by
their
very
nature
ought
to
be
dull
had
in
them
many
of
those
sallies
by
which
his
disposition
was
characterised
and
much
of
that
superiority
which
he
indisputably
possessed
above
his
contemporaries
but
though
admired
he
was
not
courted
in
our
public
places
of
education
a
wide
distance
is
studiously
preserved
between
young
men
of
fortune
and
young
men
that
have
none
but
godfrey
had
a
stiffness
and
unpliableness
of
temper
that
did
not
easily
bend
to
the
submission
that
was
expected
of
him
he
could
neither
flatter
a
blockhead
nor
pimp
for
a
peer
he
loved
his
friend
indeed
with
unbounded
warmth
and
it
was
impossible
to
surpass
him
in
generousness
and
liberality
but
he
had
a
proud
integrity
that
whispered
him
with
a
language
not
to
be
controled
that
he
was
the
inferior
of
no
man
he
was
destined
for
the
profession
of
a
divine
and
having
finished
his
studies
retired
upon
a
curacy
of
forty
pounds
a
year
his
ambition
was
grievously
mortified
at
the
obscurity
in
which
he
was
plunged
and
his
great
talents
in
spite
of
real
modesty
forcibly
convinced
him
that
this
was
not
the
station
for
which
nature
had
formed
him
but
he
had
an
enthusiasm
of
virtue
that
led
him
for
a
time
to
overlook
these
disadvantages
i
am
going
said
he
to
dwell
among
scenes
of
unvitiated
nature
i
will
form
the
peasant
to
generosity
and
sentiment
i
will
teach
laborious
industry
to
look
without
envy
and
without
asperity
upon
those
above
them
i
will
be
the
friend
and
the
father
of
the
meanest
of
my
flock
i
will
give
sweetness
and
beauty
to
the
most
rugged
scenes
the
man
that
banishes
envy
and
introduces
contentment
the
man
that
converts
the
little
circle
in
which
he
dwells
into
a
terrestrial
paradise
that
renders
men
innocent
here
and
happy
for
ever
may
be
obscure
may
be
despised
by
the
superciliousness
of
luxury
but
it
shall
never
be
said
that
he
has
been
a
blank
in
creation
the
supreme
being
will
regard
him
with
a
complacency
which
he
will
deny
to
kings
that
oppress
and
conquerors
that
destroy
the
work
of
his
hands
such
were
the
suggestions
of
youthful
imagination
but
godfrey
presently
found
the
truth
of
that
maxim
as
paradoxical
as
it
is
indisputable
that
the
heart
of
man
is
naturally
hard
and
unamiable
he
conducted
himself
in
his
new
situation
with
the
most
unexceptionable
propriety
and
the
most
generous
benevolence
but
there
were
men
in
his
audience
men
who
loved
better
to
criticise
than
to
be
amended
and
women
who
felt
more
complacency
in
scandal
than
eulogium
he
displeased
the
one
by
disappointing
them
it
was
impossible
to
disappoint
the
other
he
laboured
unremittedly
but
his
labours
returned
to
him
void
and
is
it
for
this
said
he
that
i
have
sacrificed
ambition
and
buried
talents
is
humility
to
be
rewarded
only
with
mortification
is
obscurity
and
retirement
the
favourite
scene
of
uneasiness
ingratitude
and
impertinence
they
shall
be
no
longer
my
torment
in
no
scene
can
i
meet
with
a
more
scanty
success
he
now
obtained
a
recommendation
to
be
private
tutor
to
the
children
of
a
nobleman
this
nobleman
was
celebrated
for
the
politeness
of
his
manners
and
the
elegance
of
his
taste
it
was
his
boast
and
his
ambition
to
be
considered
as
the
patron
of
men
of
letters
with
his
prospect
therefore
in
this
connection
godfrey
was
perfectly
satisfied
i
shall
no
longer
said
he
be
the
slave
of
ignorance
and
the
victim
of
insensibility
my
talents
perhaps
point
me
a
step
higher
than
to
the
business
of
forming
the
minds
of
youth
but
at
least
the
youth
under
my
care
are
destined
to
fill
the
most
conspicuous
stations
in
future
life
if
propitious
fortune
might
have
raised
me
to
the
character
of
a
statesman
depressed
by
adversity
i
may
yet
have
the
honour
of
moulding
the
mind
and
infusing
generosity
into
the
heart
of
a
future
statesman
i
have
heard
the
second
son
of
my
patron
celebrated
for
the
early
promises
of
capacity
to
unfold
the
springing
germs
of
genius
to
direct
them
in
the
path
of
general
happiness
is
an
employment
by
no
means
unworthy
of
a
philosopher
in
this
situation
godfrey
however
once
more
looked
for
pleasure
and
found
disappointment
the
nobleman
had
more
the
affectation
of
a
patron
than
any
real
enthusiasm
in
the
cause
of
literature
the
abilities
of
godfrey
were
universally
acknowledged
and
so
long
as
the
novelty
remained
he
was
caressed
honoured
and
distinguished
in
a
short
time
however
he
was
completely
forgotten
by
the
patron
in
the
hurry
of
dissipation
and
the
pursuits
of
an
unbounded
ambition
his
eldest
care
was
universally
confessed
stupid
and
impracticable
and
in
the
younger
he
found
nothing
but
the
prating
forwardness
of
a
boy
who
had
been
flattered
without
sentiment
and
without
meaning
her
ladyship
treated
godfrey
with
superciliousness
as
an
intruder
at
her
lord
table
the
servants
caught
the
example
and
showed
him
a
distinction
of
neglect
which
the
exquisiteness
of
his
sensibility
would
not
permit
him
to
despise
mortified
irritated
depressed
he
now
quitted
his
task
half
finished
and
threw
himself
upon
the
world
the
present
age
said
he
is
not
an
age
in
which
talents
are
overlooked
and
genius
depressed
he
had
heard
much
of
the
affluence
of
writers
a
churchil
a
smollet
and
a
goldsmith
who
had
depended
upon
that
only
for
their
support
he
saw
the
celebrated
johnson
caressed
by
all
parties
and
acknowledged
to
be
second
to
no
man
whatever
were
his
rank
however
conspicuous
his
station
full
of
these
ideas
he
soon
completed
a
production
fraught
with
the
fire
and
originality
of
genius
pointed
in
its
remarks
and
elegant
in
its
style
he
had
now
to
experience
vexations
of
which
he
had
before
entertained
no
idea
he
carried
his
work
from
bookseller
to
bookseller
and
was
every
where
refused
his
performance
was
not
seasoned
to
the
times
he
was
a
person
that
nobody
knew
and
he
had
no
man
of
rank
by
his
importunities
and
eloquence
to
force
him
into
the
ranks
of
fashion
at
length
he
found
a
bookseller
foolish
enough
to
undertake
it
but
he
presently
perceived
that
the
gentlemen
at
the
head
of
that
profession
were
wiser
than
he
all
the
motives
they
had
mentioned
and
one
more
operated
against
him
the
monarchs
of
the
critic
realm
scouted
him
with
one
voice
because
his
work
was
not
written
in
the
same
cold
phlegmatic
insupportable
manner
as
their
own
he
had
now
advanced
however
too
far
to
retreat
he
had
too
much
spirit
to
resume
either
of
those
professions
which
for
reasons
so
cogent
in
his
opinion
he
had
already
quitted
he
wrote
essays
squibs
and
pamphlets
for
an
extemporary
support
but
though
these
were
finished
with
infinite
rapidity
he
found
that
they
constituted
a
very
precarious
means
of
subsistence
the
time
of
dinner
often
came
before
the
production
that
was
to
purchase
it
was
completed
and
when
completed
it
was
frequently
several
days
before
it
could
find
a
purchaser
and
his
copy
money
and
his
taylor
bill
were
too
little
proportioned
to
one
another
he
now
recollected
what
in
the
gaiety
of
hope
he
had
forgotten
that
a
only
blows
with
its
sweetness
to
refresh
the
of
a
he
recollected
many
instances
of
works
raised
by
the
breath
of
fashion
to
the
very
pinnacle
of
reputation
that
sunk
as
soon
again
he
recollected
instances
scarcely
fewer
of
works
exquisite
in
their
composition
pregnant
with
beauties
almost
divine
that
had
passed
from
the
press
without
notice
many
had
been
revived
by
the
cooler
and
more
deliberate
judgment
of
a
future
age
and
more
had
been
lost
for
ever
the
instance
of
chatterton
as
a
proof
that
the
universal
patronage
of
genius
was
by
no
means
the
virtue
of
his
contemporaries
flashed
in
his
face
and
he
looked
forward
to
the
same
fate
at
no
great
distance
as
his
own
to
godfrey
however
fortune
was
in
one
degree
more
propitious
damon
was
among
the
few
whose
judgment
was
not
guided
by
the
dictate
of
fashion
having
met
accidentally
with
the
performance
we
have
mentioned
he
was
struck
with
its
beauties
as
he
had
heard
nothing
of
it
in
the
politest
circles
he
concluded
with
his
usual
penetration
that
the
author
of
it
was
in
obscure
and
narrow
circumstances
as
day
to
sweet
interested
warmly
in
the
fortune
of
the
writer
of
so
amiable
a
performance
he
flew
to
his
bookseller
with
the
usual
enquiries
the
bookseller
stared
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
splendour
of
his
dress
and
his
gilded
chariot
would
have
been
tempted
to
smile
at
so
unfashionable
and
absurd
a
question
he
soon
however
obtained
the
information
he
desired
and
his
eagerness
was
increased
when
the
name
of
godfrey
and
the
recollection
of
the
talents
by
which
he
had
been
so
eminently
distinguished
led
him
to
apprehend
that
he
was
one
to
whose
abilities
and
character
he
had
been
greatly
attached
he
found
some
difficulty
to
obtain
admission
but
this
was
quickly
removed
as
from
the
dignity
of
his
appearance
it
was
not
probable
that
he
was
a
person
from
whom
godfrey
had
any
thing
to
apprehend
he
found
him
in
a
wretched
apartment
his
hair
dishevelled
and
his
dress
threadbare
and
neglected
godfrey
was
unspeakably
surprised
at
his
appearance
and
it
was
with
much
difficulty
that
damon
prevailed
upon
him
to
accept
of
an
assistance
that
he
assured
him
should
be
but
temporary
if
it
were
in
the
power
of
him
or
any
of
his
connections
to
render
him
respectable
and
independent
in
such
a
situation
as
himself
should
chuse
disappointment
and
misfortune
are
calculated
to
inspire
asperity
into
the
gentlest
heart
godfrey
inveighed
with
warmth
and
sometimes
with
partiality
against
the
coldness
and
narrowness
of
the
age
he
said
that
men
of
genius
in
conspicuous
stations
had
no
feeling
for
those
whom
nature
had
made
their
brothers
and
that
those
who
had
risen
from
obscurity
themselves
forgot
the
mortifications
of
their
earlier
life
and
did
not
imitate
the
generous
justice
which
had
enabled
them
to
fulfil
the
destination
of
nature
but
though
misfortune
had
taught
him
asperity
upon
certain
subjects
it
had
not
corrupted
his
manners
debauched
his
integrity
or
narrowed
his
heart
he
had
still
the
same
warmth
in
the
cause
of
virtue
as
in
days
of
the
most
unexperienced
simplicity
he
still
dreaded
an
oath
and
reverenced
the
divinity
of
innocence
he
still
believed
in
a
god
and
was
sincerely
attached
to
his
honour
though
he
had
often
been
told
that
this
was
a
prejudice
unworthy
of
his
comprehension
of
thinking
upon
all
other
subjects
chapter
iii
such
was
the
story
in
its
most
essential
circumstances
that
godfrey
related
delia
was
exceedingly
interested
in
the
gaiety
of
his
imagination
the
cruelty
of
his
disappointments
and
the
acuteness
and
goodness
of
heart
that
appeared
in
his
reflections
miss
fletcher
listened
to
the
whole
with
gaping
wonder
but
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
she
began
with
her
usual
observations
well
said
she
i
never
saw
an
author
before
i
could
not
have
thought
that
he
could
have
looked
like
a
gentleman
why
i
vow
i
could
sometimes
have
taken
him
for
a
beau
ay
but
then
he
talked
for
all
the
world
as
if
it
had
been
written
in
a
book
well
by
my
troth
it
was
a
mighty
pretty
story
but
i
should
have
liked
it
better
if
there
had
been
a
sighing
nymph
or
a
duel
or
two
in
it
but
do
you
think
it
was
all
of
his
own
making
we
will
not
trouble
the
reader
to
accompany
our
ladies
from
stage
to
stage
during
the
remainder
of
their
journey
nothing
more
remarkable
happened
and
in
ten
days
they
arrived
again
at
southampton
damon
met
moreland
in
london
and
with
that
simplicity
and
candour
by
which
he
was
distinguished
related
to
him
every
circumstance
of
his
story
moreland
had
no
predilection
in
favour
of
lord
thomas
villiers
his
sister
whom
he
esteemed
in
all
respects
an
amiable
woman
had
by
no
means
lived
happily
with
her
husband
avarice
and
pride
of
rank
were
the
farthest
in
the
world
from
being
the
foibles
of
moreland
and
the
sensibility
of
his
disposition
did
not
permit
him
to
treat
the
faults
to
which
himself
was
a
stranger
with
much
indulgence
he
therefore
encouraged
damon
to
persevere
in
the
pursuit
of
his
inclination
and
invited
him
to
return
with
him
into
the
country
he
promised
himself
to
propose
the
match
to
hartley
and
assured
his
nephew
that
he
should
never
feel
any
narrowness
in
his
circumstances
in
case
of
his
displeasure
while
it
was
in
his
power
to
render
them
affluent
in
pursuit
of
this
plan
damon
moreland
and
sir
william
twyford
whom
they
found
in
london
and
whose
goodness
of
humour
led
him
heartily
to
approve
of
the
alteration
in
the
plan
of
his
friend
arrived
almost
as
soon
as
our
travellers
in
the
neighbourhood
of
southampton
sir
william
and
damon
soon
waited
upon
their
respective
mistresses
and
in
company
so
mutually
acceptable
time
sped
with
a
greater
velocity
than
was
usual
to
him
and
days
appeared
no
more
than
hours
it
was
impossible
that
such
a
connexion
should
pass
long
unnoticed
it
must
be
confessed
however
that
it
met
with
no
interruption
from
lord
martin
perhaps
it
might
have
escaped
his
notice
though
it
escaped
that
of
no
other
person
perhaps
he
was
satiated
with
the
glory
he
had
acquired
and
having
conquered
one
beau
would
not
like
alexander
have
sighed
if
there
had
remained
no
other
beau
to
conquer
perhaps
the
countenance
of
hartley
of
which
he
considered
himself
as
securer
than
ever
led
him
like
a
wise
general
to
reflect
that
in
staking
his
life
against
that
of
a
lover
whose
chance
of
success
was
almost
wholly
precluded
he
mould
make
a
very
unfair
and
unequal
combat
be
this
as
it
will
hartley
had
no
such
motives
to
overlook
this
new
occurrence
just
however
as
he
had
begun
to
take
it
into
his
mature
consideration
he
received
the
compliments
of
moreland
with
an
intimation
of
his
design
to
make
him
a
visit
that
very
afternoon
at
this
message
hartley
was
a
good
deal
surprised
moreland
he
had
never
but
once
seen
and
in
that
visit
he
thought
he
had
had
reason
to
be
offended
with
him
if
that
gentleman
treated
the
company
of
prattle
and
lord
martin
persons
universally
admired
as
not
good
enough
for
him
it
seemed
unaccountable
that
he
should
have
recourse
to
him
he
was
neither
distinguished
by
the
elegance
of
his
accomplishments
nor
did
he
much
pride
himself
in
the
attainments
of
literature
after
many
conjectures
he
at
length
determined
with
infinite
sagacity
to
suspend
his
judgement
till
moreland
mould
solve
the
enigma
this
determination
was
scarcely
made
before
his
visitor
arrived
that
gentleman
who
though
full
of
sensibility
and
benevolence
was
not
a
man
of
empty
ceremony
immediately
opened
his
business
hartley
drew
himself
up
in
his
chair
and
with
the
dignity
of
a
citizen
of
london
who
thinks
that
the
first
character
in
the
world
cried
well
sir
and
who
is
this
nephew
of
yours
i
think
i
never
heard
of
him
he
is
the
son
answered
moreland
of
lord
thomas
villiers
lord
thomas
villiers
then
i
suppose
he
is
a
great
man
and
pray
now
sir
if
this
great
man
has
a
mind
that
his
son
should
marry
my
daughter
why
does
he
not
come
and
tell
me
so
himself
why
in
truth
said
the
other
lord
thomas
villiers
has
no
mind
but
my
nephew
is
his
only
son
and
therefore
can
not
be
deprived
of
the
principal
part
of
his
estate
after
his
death
in
the
mean
time
i
will
take
care
that
he
shall
have
an
income
perfectly
equal
to
the
fortune
of
miss
hartley
you
will
sir
and
so
in
the
first
place
this
young
spark
would
have
me
encourage
him
in
disobedience
which
is
the
greatest
crime
upon
god
earth
and
in
the
second
he
thinks
that
i
bob
hartley
as
i
sit
here
will
marry
my
daughter
into
any
family
that
is
too
proud
to
own
us
as
to
that
sir
said
moreland
you
must
judge
for
yourself
the
young
gentleman
is
an
unexceptionable
match
and
i
sir
whose
fortune
and
character
i
flatter
myself
are
not
inferior
to
that
of
any
gentleman
in
the
county
shall
always
be
proud
to
own
and
receive
the
young
lady
why
as
to
that
to
be
sure
you
may
be
in
the
right
for
that
i
know
but
my
daughter
do
you
see
is
already
engaged
to
lord
martin
i
should
have
thought
replied
moreland
that
objection
might
have
been
stated
in
the
first
instance
without
any
reflexions
upon
the
conduct
and
family
of
the
young
gentleman
but
are
you
sure
that
lord
martin
is
the
man
of
your
daughter
choice
i
can
not
say
that
i
ever
her
for
i
do
not
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
the
matter
lord
martin
do
you
see
is
a
fine
young
man
and
a
fine
fortune
and
delia
is
my
own
daughter
and
if
she
should
boggle
about
having
him
i
would
cut
her
off
with
a
shilling
sir
answered
moreland
with
much
indignation
that
is
a
conduct
that
would
deserve
to
be
execrated
my
nephew
without
any
sinister
means
is
master
of
your
daughter
affection
and
lord
martin
i
have
authority
to
tell
you
is
her
aversion
oh
ho
is
it
so
well
then
sir
i
will
tell
you
what
i
shall
do
your
nephew
shall
never
have
my
daughter
though
she
had
but
a
rag
to
her
tail
and
as
for
her
affections
and
her
aversion
i
will
lock
her
up
and
keep
her
upon
bread
and
water
till
she
knows
that
she
ought
to
have
neither
before
her
own
father
has
told
her
is
moreland
all
of
whose
nerves
were
irritated
into
a
fever
by
so
much
vulgarity
and
such
brutal
insensibility
could
retain
his
seat
no
longer
he
started
up
and
regarding
his
entertainer
with
a
look
of
ineffable
indignation
flung
the
door
in
his
face
and
retreated
to
his
chariot
chapter
iv
ado
about
damon
was
inexpressibly
afflicted
at
the
success
of
his
uncle
embassy
when
moreland
related
to
him
the
particulars
of
his
visit
damon
recollected
the
opposite
tempers
of
the
two
gentlemen
and
blamed
himself
for
not
having
foreseen
the
event
hartley
was
infinitely
exasperated
at
the
cavalierness
with
which
he
had
been
treated
he
now
discovered
the
true
cause
of
his
daughter
pertinacity
and
proceeded
with
more
vigour
than
ever
and
so
cried
he
you
have
dared
to
engage
your
affections
without
my
privity
have
you
a
pretty
story
truly
and
you
would
disgrace
me
for
ever
by
marrying
into
the
family
of
a
lord
that
despises
us
and
an
old
fellow
that
for
half
a
word
would
knock
your
father
brains
out
indeed
sir
replied
delia
i
never
thought
of
marrying
without
your
consent
i
only
gave
the
young
gentleman
leave
to
ask
it
of
you
you
gave
him
leave
and
pray
who
are
you
and
so
you
was
in
league
with
him
to
send
this
fellow
to
abuse
me
upon
my
word
i
was
not
and
i
am
very
sorry
if
moreland
has
behaved
improperly
moreland
and
so
you
pretend
to
doubt
of
it
but
let
me
tell
you
i
have
provided
you
a
husband
worth
fifty
of
this
young
prig
and
i
will
make
you
think
so
indeed
sir
i
can
never
think
so
you
can
not
and
pray
who
told
you
to
object
before
i
have
named
the
man
why
child
lord
martin
has
ten
thousand
pounds
a
year
and
is
a
peer
and
is
not
ashamed
of
us
one
bit
in
all
the
world
alas
sir
i
can
never
have
lord
martin
do
not
mention
him
i
am
in
no
hurry
i
will
live
single
as
long
as
you
please
yes
and
when
you
have
persuaded
me
to
that
you
will
jump
out
at
window
the
next
day
to
this
ungracious
rascal
oh
pray
sir
do
not
speak
so
he
is
good
and
gentle
why
hussey
am
i
not
master
in
my
own
house
i
shall
have
a
fine
time
of
it
indeed
if
i
must
give
you
an
account
of
my
words
sir
said
delia
i
will
never
marry
without
your
consent
that
is
a
good
girl
no
more
you
shall
and
i
will
lock
you
up
upon
bread
and
water
if
you
do
not
consent
to
marry
who
i
please
the
despotic
temper
of
hartley
led
him
to
treat
his
daughter
with
considerable
severity
he
suffered
her
to
go
very
little
abroad
and
employed
every
precaution
in
his
power
to
prevent
any
interview
between
her
and
her
lover
he
tried
every
instrument
in
turn
threats
promises
intreaties
blustering
to
bend
her
to
his
will
and
when
he
found
that
by
all
these
means
he
made
no
progress
as
his
last
resource
he
fixed
a
day
at
no
great
distance
when
he
assured
her
he
would
be
disappointed
no
longer
and
she
should
either
voluntarily
or
by
force
yield
her
hand
to
lord
martin
during
these
transactions
the
communication
between
delia
and
her
lover
was
with
no
great
difficulty
kept
open
by
the
instrumentality
of
their
two
friends
they
scarcely
dared
indeed
to
think
of
seeing
each
other
as
in
case
this
were
discovered
delia
would
be
subject
to
still
greater
restraint
and
the
intercourse
between
her
and
miss
fletcher
be
rendered
more
difficult
in
one
instance
however
this
lady
ventured
to
procure
the
interview
so
ardently
desired
by
both
parties
damon
made
use
of
this
opportunity
to
persuade
his
mistress
to
an
elopement
you
have
already
carried
said
he
your
obedience
to
the
utmost
exremity
you
have
tried
every
means
to
bend
the
inflexible
will
of
your
father
if
not
for
my
sake
then
at
least
for
your
own
avoid
the
crisis
that
is
preparing
for
you
you
detect
the
husband
that
your
father
designs
you
if
united
to
him
you
confess
you
must
be
miserable
but
who
can
tell
in
the
midst
of
persons
inflexibly
bent
upon
your
ruin
no
friend
at
hand
to
support
you
your
damon
banished
and
at
a
distance
what
may
be
the
event
you
will
hesitate
and
tremble
your
father
will
endeavour
to
terrify
you
into
submission
the
odious
peer
will
force
from
you
your
hand
if
in
that
moment
your
heart
should
misgive
you
if
one
faultering
accent
belie
the
sentiments
you
have
so
generously
avowed
for
me
what
ah
what
may
be
the
consequence
no
my
fair
one
fly
instantly
fly
no
duty
forbids
you
have
done
all
that
the
most
rigid
moralist
could
demand
of
you
put
yourself
into
my
protection
i
will
not
betray
your
confidence
you
shall
be
as
much
mistress
as
ever
of
all
your
actions
if
you
distrust
me
at
least
chuse
our
common
friends
sir
william
twyford
chuse
any
protector
among
the
numerous
friends
that
your
beauty
and
your
worth
have
raised
you
i
had
rather
sacrifice
my
own
prospects
of
felicity
forever
than
see
the
smallest
chance
that
you
should
be
unhappy
such
were
the
arguments
which
with
all
the
eloquence
of
a
friend
and
all
the
ardour
of
a
lover
our
hero
urged
upon
his
mistress
but
the
gentleness
of
delia
was
not
yet
sufficiently
roused
by
the
injuries
she
had
received
to
induce
her
to
cast
off
all
the
ties
which
education
and
custom
had
imposed
upon
her
and
determine
upon
so
decisive
a
step
surely
said
she
there
is
some
secret
reward
some
unexpected
deliverance
in
reserve
for
filial
simplicity
oh
how
harsh
how
bold
how
questionable
a
step
is
that
to
which
you
would
persuade
me
circumstanced
in
this
manner
the
fairest
reputation
might
provoke
the
tongue
of
scandal
and
the
most
spotless
innocence
open
a
door
to
the
blast
of
calumny
i
will
not
say
that
such
a
step
may
not
be
sometimes
justifiable
i
will
not
say
to
what
i
may
myself
be
urged
but
oh
how
unmingled
the
triumph
how
sincere
the
joy
if
by
persevering
in
a
conduct
in
which
the
path
of
duty
is
too
palpable
to
be
mistaken
propitious
fate
may
rather
grant
me
the
happiness
after
which
i
aspire
than
i
be
forced
as
it
were
myself
to
wrest
it
from
the
hands
of
providence
such
was
the
result
of
this
last
and
decisive
interview
delia
could
not
be
moved
from
that
line
of
conduct
upon
which
she
had
so
virtuously
resolved
and
damon
having
in
vain
exerted
all
the
rhetoric
of
which
he
was
master
now
gave
way
to
the
gloomy
suggestions
of
despair
and
now
flattered
himself
with
the
gleams
of
hope
he
sometimes
thought
that
delia
might
yet
be
induced
to
adopt
the
plan
he
had
proposed
and
sometimes
he
gave
way
to
the
serene
confidence
she
expressed
and
indulged
the
pleasing
expectation
that
virtue
would
not
always
remain
without
its
reward
chapter
woman
of
we
are
now
brought
in
the
course
of
our
story
to
the
memorable
scene
at
miss
cranley
miss
cranley
exclaims
one
of
our
readers
in
a
tone
of
admiration
miss
cranley
cries
another
and
pray
who
is
she
i
distribute
my
readers
into
two
classes
the
indolent
and
the
supercilious
and
shall
accordingly
address
them
upon
the
present
occasion
to
the
former
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
than
to
refer
them
back
to
the
latter
part
of
chapter
part
where
my
dear
ladies
you
will
find
an
accurate
account
of
the
character
of
two
personages
who
it
seems
you
have
totally
forgotten
to
the
supercilious
i
have
a
very
different
story
to
tell
most
learned
sirs
i
kiss
your
hands
i
acknowledge
my
error
and
throw
myself
upon
your
clemency
you
see
however
gentlemen
that
you
were
somewhat
mistaken
when
you
imagined
that
i
like
my
fair
patrons
the
indolent
had
quite
lost
these
characters
from
my
memory
to
speak
ingenuously
i
did
indeed
suppose
as
far
as
i
could
calculate
the
events
of
this
important
narrative
beforehand
that
the
miss
cranleys
would
have
come
in
earlier
and
have
made
a
more
conspicuous
figure
than
they
now
seem
to
have
any
chance
of
doing
having
thus
settled
accounts
with
my
readers
i
take
up
again
the
thread
of
my
story
and
thus
i
proceed
hartley
being
now
as
he
believed
upon
the
point
of
disposing
of
his
daughter
in
marriage
began
seriously
to
consider
that
he
should
want
a
female
companion
to
manage
his
family
to
nurse
his
ailments
and
to
repair
the
breaches
that
the
hand
of
wintry
time
had
made
in
his
spirits
and
his
constitution
the
reader
will
be
pleased
to
recollect
that
he
had
already
laid
siege
to
the
heart
of
the
gentle
sophia
he
now
prosecuted
his
affair
with
more
alacrity
than
ever
alas
my
dear
readers
while
we
have
been
junketting
along
from
southampton
to
oxford
from
oxford
to
windsor
and
from
windsor
to
southampton
back
again
such
is
the
miserable
fate
of
human
kind
miss
amelia
wilhelmina
cranley
the
most
pious
of
her
sex
the
flower
of
whitfield
converts
the
wonder
and
admiration
of
roger
the
cobler
has
given
up
the
ghost
you
will
please
then
in
what
follows
to
represent
to
yourselves
the
charms
of
sophia
as
decked
and
burnished
with
a
suit
of
sables
her
exterior
indeed
was
sable
and
gloomy
but
her
heart
was
far
superior
to
the
attacks
of
wayward
fate
she
sat
aloft
in
the
region
of
philosophy
she
steeled
her
heart
with
the
dignity
of
republicanism
for
her
to
drop
one
tear
of
sorrow
would
have
been
an
eternal
disgrace
about
this
time
it
was
perhaps
in
reality
a
manoeuvre
to
forward
the
affair
to
which
she
had
no
aversion
at
bottom
with
the
father
of
delia
that
miss
cranley
gave
a
grand
entertainment
at
which
were
present
hartley
prattle
sir
william
twyford
lord
martin
most
of
the
ladies
we
have
already
commemorated
and
many
others
the
repast
was
conducted
with
much
solemnity
the
masculine
character
of
the
mind
of
sophia
had
rendered
her
particularly
attached
to
the
grace
of
action
when
she
drank
the
health
of
any
of
her
guests
she
accompanied
it
with
a
most
profound
when
she
invited
them
to
partake
of
any
dish
she
pointed
towards
it
with
her
hand
this
action
might
have
served
to
display
a
graceful
arm
but
alas
upon
hers
the
hand
of
time
had
been
making
depredations
and
it
appeared
somewhat
coarse
and
discoloured
after
dinner
the
lady
of
the
house
as
usual
turned
the
conversation
upon
the
subject
of
politics
she
inveighed
with
much
warmth
against
the
effeminacy
and
depravity
of
the
modern
times
we
were
slaves
and
we
deserved
to
be
so
in
almost
every
country
there
now
appeared
a
king
that
puppet
pageant
that
monster
in
creation
miserable
itself
a
combination
of
every
vice
and
invented
for
the
curse
of
human
kind
where
now
she
asked
was
the
sternness
and
inflexibility
of
ancient
story
where
was
that
junius
that
stood
and
gazed
in
triumph
upon
the
execution
of
his
sons
where
that
fabricius
that
turned
up
his
nose
under
the
snout
of
an
elephant
where
was
that
marcus
brutus
who
sent
his
dagger
to
the
heart
of
cæsar
for
her
part
she
believed
and
she
would
not
give
the
snap
of
her
fingers
for
him
if
it
were
otherwise
that
he
was
in
reality
as
sage
historians
have
reported
the
son
of
julius
in
the
very
paroxysm
of
her
oratory
she
chanced
to
cast
her
eyes
upon
prattle
with
the
character
of
prattle
the
reader
is
already
partly
acquainted
but
he
does
not
yet
know
for
it
was
not
necessary
for
our
story
he
should
do
so
that
the
honourable
prattle
was
a
commoner
and
a
placeman
good
god
sir
represent
to
yourself
with
what
a
flame
of
indignation
our
amazon
surveyed
him
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
very
familiarly
turned
him
round
in
the
middle
of
the
company
this
said
she
is
one
of
our
fabiuses
one
of
our
decii
good
god
my
friend
what
would
you
do
if
a
brother
officer
shook
a
cane
over
your
shoulders
as
he
did
over
those
of
the
divine
themistocles
what
would
you
do
if
the
brutal
lull
of
an
appius
ravished
from
your
arms
an
only
daughter
but
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
you
are
a
placeman
mutually
disgracing
and
disgraced
you
sell
your
constituents
to
the
vilest
ministers
that
ever
came
forward
the
champions
of
despotism
and
those
ministers
show
us
what
is
their
insignificance
their
impotence
their
want
of
discernment
in
giving
such
a
thing
as
you
are
places
of
so
great
importance
offices
of
so
high
emolument
prattle
unused
to
be
treated
so
cavalierly
and
arraigned
before
so
large
a
company
trembled
in
every
limb
my
dear
madam
my
sweet
miss
sophia
pray
do
not
pinch
quite
so
hard
and
the
water
stood
in
his
eyes
unable
however
to
elude
her
grasp
he
fell
down
upon
his
knees
for
sake
oh
dear
oh
lack
a
daisy
why
miss
sure
you
are
mad
miss
cranley
unheedful
of
his
exclamations
was
however
just
going
to
begin
with
more
vehemence
than
ever
when
a
sudden
accident
put
a
stop
to
the
torrent
of
her
oratory
but
this
event
can
not
be
properly
related
without
going
back
a
little
in
our
narrative
and
acquainting
the
reader
with
some
of
those
circumstances
by
which
it
was
produced
chapter
vi
sir
william
twyford
had
gained
great
credit
with
lord
martin
by
his
conduct
in
the
affair
of
prettyman
he
now
imagined
that
he
saw
an
opening
for
the
exercise
of
his
humour
which
he
was
never
able
to
refill
he
communicated
his
plan
to
lord
martin
by
his
assistance
he
procured
that
implement
which
have
denominated
a
cracker
this
his
lordship
found
an
opportunity
of
attaching
to
the
skirt
of
miss
sack
at
the
moment
we
have
described
when
she
was
again
going
to
enter
into
the
stream
of
her
rhetoric
which
great
as
it
naturally
was
was
now
somewhat
improved
with
copious
draughts
of
claret
the
cracker
was
set
on
fire
poor
sophia
now
started
in
great
agitation
bounce
bounce
went
the
cracker
sophia
skipped
and
danced
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
great
gods
of
rome
exclaimed
she
jupiter
minerva
and
all
the
celestial
and
infernal
deities
the
force
of
the
cracker
was
now
somewhat
spent
ye
boys
of
britain
that
bear
not
one
mark
of
manhood
about
you
would
leonidas
have
fastened
a
squib
to
the
robe
of
the
spartan
mother
would
cimber
have
so
unworthily
used
portia
the
wife
of
brutus
would
corbulo
thus
have
interrupted
the
heroic
fortitude
of
arria
the
spouse
of
thrasea
paetus
my
dear
madam
exclaimed
lord
martin
his
eyes
glistening
with
triumph
with
all
submission
corbulo
i
believe
had
been
assassinated
before
arria
so
gloriously
put
an
end
to
her
existence
thou
thing
cried
miss
cranky
and
hast
thou
escaped
the
torrent
of
my
invective
thou
eternal
blot
to
the
list
in
which
are
inserted
the
names
of
a
faulkland
a
shaftesbury
a
somers
and
above
all
that
leicester
who
so
bravely
threw
the
lie
in
the
face
of
his
sovereign
he
he
cried
lord
martin
who
could
no
longer
refrain
from
boasting
of
his
great
atchievement
if
i
have
escaped
your
vengeance
let
me
tell
you
madam
you
have
not
escaped
mine
and
was
it
thee
thou
nincompoop
hence
thou
wretch
avaunt
begone
or
thou
shalt
feel
my
fury
saying
this
she
clenched
her
fist
and
closed
her
teeth
with
so
threatening
an
aspect
that
the
little
peer
was
very
much
terrified
he
flew
back
several
paces
my
dear
miss
griskin
said
he
protect
me
this
barbarous
woman
does
not
understand
wit
and
he
precipitately
burst
out
of
the
room
the
lady
too
was
so
much
discomposed
that
she
thought
proper
to
retire
assuring
the
company
that
she
would
attend
them
again
in
a
moment
well
cried
miss
griskin
as
soon
as
she
had
disappeared
this
was
the
nicest
fun
i
was
afraid
said
miss
prim
it
would
have
discomposed
miss
cranley
petticoats
law
my
dear
said
miss
gawky
by
my
so
i
like
the
music
of
a
cracker
better
than
all
the
concerts
in
the
varsal
world
we
need
not
inform
our
readers
that
miss
languish
in
the
very
height
and
altitude
of
the
confusion
had
been
obliged
to
retire
lord
martin
in
the
midst
of
his
triumph
and
exultation
had
not
leisure
to
recollect
nor
perhaps
penetration
to
perceive
the
effect
that
this
little
sally
might
have
upon
his
interests
despotic
and
boorish
as
was
the
genius
of
hartley
it
cowred
under
that
of
sophia
with
the
most
abject
servility
and
that
lady
now
vowed
eternal
war
against
the
heroical
peer
hartley
said
she
in
their
next
a
let
me
tell
you
lord
martin
must
never
have
miss
delia
my
dearest
life
said
the
old
gentleman
consider
the
day
is
fixed
my
word
is
passed
and
it
is
too
late
to
revoke
now
beside
lord
martin
has
ten
thousand
pounds
a
year
ten
thousand
figs
said
she
do
not
tell
me
it
is
never
too
late
to
be
wife
lord
martin
is
a
venal
senator
and
a
little
sniveling
fellow
my
dear
said
hartley
i
never
differed
from
you
before
do
let
me
have
my
mind
now
have
your
mind
sir
men
should
have
no
minds
tyrants
that
they
are
and
now
i
think
of
it
miss
delia
does
not
like
lord
martin
pooh
said
hartley
recovering
spirit
at
such
an
objection
that
is
all
stuff
and
nonsense
nonsense
let
me
tell
you
sir
women
are
not
to
be
they
are
queens
of
the
creation
and
if
they
had
their
way
and
the
government
of
the
world
was
in
their
hands
things
would
go
much
better
than
they
do
i
know
they
would
replied
her
admirer
if
they
were
all
as
wise
as
you
child
returned
sophia
turning
up
her
nose
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
the
matter
in
short
is
this
damon
loves
delia
and
delia
loves
damon
and
if
your
daughter
be
not
villiers
i
will
never
be
mrs
hartley
from
a
decision
like
this
there
could
be
no
appeal
hartley
told
lord
martin
the
next
time
he
came
to
his
house
to
pay
his
devoirs
to
his
mistress
that
he
had
altered
his
mind
his
lordship
was
too
much
surprised
at
this
manoeuvre
to
make
any
immediate
answer
so
turned
upon
his
heel
and
decamped
the
happy
revolution
by
the
intervention
of
miss
fletcher
was
soon
made
known
to
sir
william
and
his
friend
damon
now
paid
his
addresses
in
form
a
reconciliation
took
place
between
moreland
and
the
father
of
our
heroine
the
marriage
was
publicly
talked
of
the
day
was
fixed
and
every
thing
prepared
for
the
nuptials
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
happiness
of
our
lovers
when
they
saw
every
obstacle
thus
unexpectedly
removed
damon
was
beside
himself
with
surprise
and
congratulation
delia
at
intervals
rubbed
her
eyes
and
could
scarcely
be
persuaded
that
it
was
not
a
dream
they
saw
each
other
at
least
once
every
day
together
they
wandered
along
the
margin
of
the
ocean
and
together
they
sought
that
delicious
alcove
which
now
appeared
ten
times
more
beautiful
from
the
recollection
it
suggested
of
the
sufferings
they
had
passed
lord
martin
was
in
the
mean
time
most
grievously
disappointed
the
devil
damn
the
fellow
said
he
he
crosses
me
like
my
evil
genius
i
have
a
month
mind
to
send
him
a
challenge
he
is
a
tall
big
looking
fellow
to
be
sure
but
then
if
i
could
contrive
to
kill
him
ah
me
but
fortune
does
not
always
favour
the
brave
my
reputation
is
established
i
do
not
want
a
duel
for
that
and
for
any
other
purpose
it
is
all
a
lottery
fire
and
furies
death
and
destruction
something
must
be
done
let
me
think
my
but
lord
martin
was
not
the
only
one
whose
hopes
were
disappointed
by
the
expected
marriage
of
delia
he
loved
her
not
he
felt
not
one
flutter
of
complacency
about
his
heart
it
was
vanity
that
first
prompted
him
to
address
her
it
was
disappointed
pride
that
now
stung
him
even
prattle
viewed
her
with
a
more
generous
affection
his
genius
was
not
indeed
a
daring
one
but
it
was
active
and
indefatigable
squire
savage
did
not
feel
the
less
though
he
did
not
spend
many
words
about
it
he
was
a
blustering
hector
he
had
the
reputation
of
fearing
nothing
and
caring
for
nothing
that
stood
in
his
way
there
were
also
other
lovers
beside
these
the
muse
knows
not
nor
desires
to
in
this
manner
gins
and
snares
seemed
on
every
side
to
surround
our
happy
and
heedless
lovers
they
sported
on
the
brink
they
sighed
and
smiled
and
sang
and
talked
again
at
length
the
eve
of
the
day
from
which
their
future
happiness
was
to
be
dated
arrived
they
had
but
one
drawback
the
continued
averseness
of
lord
thomas
villiers
damon
was
however
now
obliged
together
with
hartley
to
attend
the
lawyers
at
moreland
in
order
to
complete
the
previous
formalities
chapter
vii
what
will
terrify
the
at
such
a
moment
as
this
a
mind
of
delicacy
and
sensibility
is
fond
of
solitude
delia
told
bridget
that
she
would
take
her
usual
walk
and
be
home
time
enough
to
superintend
the
oeconomy
of
supper
at
which
the
company
of
damon
and
sir
william
twyford
was
expected
they
accordingly
arrived
before
nine
bridget
expected
her
mistress
every
moment
damon
and
his
friend
would
have
gone
out
to
meet
her
but
they
were
not
willing
to
leave
hartley
alone
the
clock
however
struck
ten
and
no
delia
appeared
every
one
now
began
to
be
seriously
uneasy
damon
and
sir
william
went
in
both
her
most
favourite
walks
to
find
her
but
in
vain
messengers
were
dispatched
twenty
different
ways
the
lover
repaired
to
the
mansion
of
lord
martin
the
baronet
immediately
set
out
for
the
house
of
savage
hartley
who
with
the
external
of
a
bear
and
the
heart
of
a
miser
was
not
destitute
of
the
feelings
of
a
parent
was
now
exceedingly
agitated
he
strided
up
and
down
the
room
with
incredible
velocity
he
bit
his
fingers
with
anxiety
and
threw
his
wig
into
the
fire
as
i
am
a
good
man
said
he
prattle
lives
but
almost
next
door
and
i
will
go
to
him
prattle
was
at
home
and
having
heard
his
story
condoled
with
him
upon
it
with
much
apparent
sincerity
damon
met
with
the
same
success
lord
martin
received
him
with
perfect
serenity
bless
us
cried
he
and
is
miss
delia
gone
i
never
was
more
astonished
in
my
life
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
and
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
villiers
said
he
with
the
utmost
gravity
i
have
all
possible
respect
for
you
blast
me
if
i
am
not
willing
to
forget
all
our
former
rivalship
tell
me
sir
can
i
do
you
any
service
damon
had
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
his
behaviour
and
flew
out
of
the
house
in
a
moment
sir
william
twyford
did
not
however
meet
with
the
person
he
went
in
quest
of
miss
savage
informed
him
that
her
brother
not
two
hours
ago
had
received
a
letter
and
immediately
without
informing
her
of
his
design
which
indeed
he
very
seldom
did
ordered
his
best
hunter
out
of
the
stable
she
added
that
she
had
imagined
that
he
had
received
a
summons
to
a
early
the
next
morning
such
was
the
account
brought
by
sir
william
to
the
anxious
and
distracted
damon
alas
cried
he
it
is
but
too
plain
she
is
by
this
time
in
the
hands
of
that
insensible
boor
oh
who
can
bear
to
think
of
it
he
is
perhaps
at
this
moment
tormenting
her
with
his
nauseous
familiarities
and
griping
her
soft
and
tender
limbs
oh
why
was
i
born
why
was
i
ever
cheated
with
the
phantom
of
happiness
wretch
wretch
that
i
am
with
these
words
he
burst
out
of
the
house
and
flew
along
with
surprising
rapidity
sir
william
having
hastily
ordered
everything
to
be
prepared
for
a
pursuit
immediately
followed
him
he
found
him
wafted
spent
and
almost
insensible
lying
beside
a
little
brook
that
crossed
the
road
the
baronet
raised
him
in
his
arms
and
with
the
gentlest
accents
that
friendship
ever
poured
into
a
mortal
ear
recovered
him
to
life
and
perception
where
am
i
said
the
disconsolate
lover
who
are
you
ah
my
friend
my
best
my
tried
friend
i
know
you
now
how
came
i
here
has
any
thing
unfortunate
happened
where
is
my
delia
let
us
seek
her
my
villiers
said
the
baronet
seek
her
what
is
she
lost
oh
yes
i
recollect
it
now
she
is
gone
snatched
from
my
arms
let
us
pursue
her
let
us
overtake
her
oh
that
it
may
not
be
too
late
he
now
leaned
upon
the
shoulder
of
his
friend
and
returned
with
painful
and
irregular
steps
his
disorder
was
so
great
that
sir
william
thought
it
best
to
have
him
immediately
conveyed
to
a
chamber
he
was
so
much
exhausted
that
this
was
easily
accomplished
without
his
being
perfectly
sensible
what
was
done
the
baronet
with
three
servants
mounted
on
horseback
immediately
pursued
the
road
towards
having
thus
related
the
confusion
and
grief
that
were
occasioned
by
her
sudden
disappearance
we
will
now
return
to
our
heroine
she
had
advanced
according
to
the
intention
she
had
hinted
to
her
servant
towards
the
grove
where
she
had
so
often
wandered
with
her
beloved
she
was
wrapped
up
and
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
her
approaching
felicity
and
is
every
difficulty
surmounted
and
shall
at
last
my
fate
be
twined
with
damon
sure
it
is
too
much
it
can
not
be
fate
does
not
deal
so
partially
with
mortals
to
bestow
so
vast
a
happiness
on
one
while
thousands
pine
in
helpless
misery
but
let
me
not
be
incredulous
let
me
not
be
ungrateful
no
since
heaven
has
thus
accumulated
its
favours
on
me
my
future
days
shall
all
be
spent
in
raising
the
oppressed
and
cheering
the
disconsolate
i
will
remember
that
i
also
have
tasted
the
cup
of
woe
that
i
have
looked
forward
to
disappointment
and
despair
by
the
hand
that
pities
me
i
will
learn
to
pity
others
she
was
thus
musing
with
herself
she
was
thus
full
of
piety
and
virtuous
resolution
when
on
a
sudden
a
trampling
of
horses
behind
her
roused
her
from
her
reverie
two
persons
advanced
but
before
she
had
time
to
examine
their
features
or
even
to
remove
out
of
the
path
by
which
they
seemed
to
be
coming
the
foremost
of
them
leaping
hastily
upon
the
ground
seized
her
by
the
waist
arid
in
spite
of
all
her
struggling
placed
her
on
the
front
of
the
saddle
and
instantly
mounted
with
the
utmost
agility
cries
and
tears
were
vain
they
were
in
a
solitary
path
little
beaten
by
the
careful
husbandman
or
the
gay
votaries
of
fashion
she
was
now
hurried
along
and
generally
at
full
speed
through
a
thousand
bye
paths
that
seemed
capable
of
puzzling
the
most
assiduous
pursuit
they
had
scarcely
advanced
two
little
miles
ere
they
arrived
at
a
large
and
broad
highway
here
they
found
a
chariot
ready
waiting
for
them
into
which
delia
was
immediately
thrust
she
now
for
the
first
time
lifted
up
her
eyes
the
first
object
to
which
she
attended
was
the
faces
of
her
ravishers
of
him
who
had
been
the
most
active
she
had
not
the
smallest
recollection
the
other
who
was
in
a
livery
she
imagined
she
had
seen
somewhere
though
in
the
present
confusion
of
her
mind
she
could
not
fix
upon
the
place
she
next
looked
round
her
with
wildness
and
eagerness
as
far
as
her
eye
could
reach
to
see
if
there
were
no
protector
no
deliverance
near
but
she
looked
in
vain
all
was
solitude
and
stilness
the
murmurs
the
activity
of
the
day
were
past
and
now
the
silver
moon
in
radiant
majesty
shed
a
solemn
serenity
ever
the
whole
scene
serenity
alas
to
the
heart
at
ease
but
nothing
could
bring
serenity
to
the
troubled
breast
of
delia
as
her
last
resource
she
appealed
to
those
who
by
brutal
force
had
carried
her
away
oh
if
you
have
any
hearts
any
thing
human
that
dwells
about
you
pity
a
poor
forlorn
and
helpless
maid
alas
in
what
have
i
injured
you
what
would
you
do
to
me
oh
pray
miss
do
not
be
frightened
said
the
first
ravisher
with
an
accent
of
familiar
vulgarity
we
will
do
you
no
harm
we
mean
nothing
but
your
good
you
will
make
your
fortune
you
never
had
such
luck
in
your
life
you
will
have
reason
to
thank
us
the
longest
day
you
can
ever
know
chapter
viii
at
this
moment
delia
with
infinite
transport
heard
the
sound
of
horses
at
a
distance
every
thing
was
quiet
our
heroine
listened
with
eager
expectation
and
those
who
guarded
her
looked
out
to
see
who
it
was
that
approached
suspense
was
not
long
on
either
side
the
horsemen
were
up
with
them
in
a
moment
oh
whoever
you
are
cried
delia
in
an
agony
of
distress
pity
and
relieve
the
most
miserable
woman
she
received
no
answer
but
the
horses
stopped
and
lord
martin
was
in
a
moment
at
the
door
of
the
carriage
oh
my
lord
cried
delia
is
it
you
thanks
eternal
thanks
for
this
fortunate
incident
if
you
had
not
come
heaven
knows
what
would
have
become
of
me
those
brutes
those
wretches
but
conduct
me
my
lord
to
my
father
house
without
doubt
they
must
by
this
time
be
in
a
terrible
fright
do
not
be
uneasy
cried
his
lordship
endeavouring
to
assume
an
harmonious
but
missing
his
point
he
spoke
in
the
shrillest
and
most
squeaking
accent
that
can
be
imagined
do
not
be
uneasy
my
charmer
you
are
in
the
hands
of
a
man
that
loves
you
as
never
woman
was
loved
before
but
i
will
be
with
you
in
a
minute
said
he
and
withdrawing
behind
the
carriage
he
beckoned
to
the
person
who
had
conducted
the
business
of
the
rape
why
you
incorrigible
blockhead
said
lord
martin
you
have
neglected
half
your
instructions
why
her
hands
are
at
liberty
i
beg
your
honour
pardon
replied
the
pimp
i
had
indeed
forgotten
but
it
shall
be
remedied
in
a
moment
and
saying
this
he
pulled
a
strong
ribband
out
of
his
pocket
and
getting
into
the
chariot
fastened
the
soft
and
lily
hands
of
our
heroine
behind
her
she
screamed
and
invoked
the
name
of
his
lordship
a
thousand
times
her
hair
became
disentangled
from
its
ligaments
and
flowed
in
waving
ringlets
about
her
snowy
panting
bosom
exhausted
with
continual
agitation
and
particularly
with
the
last
struggle
she
seemed
ready
to
faint
but
was
quickly
restored
by
the
assiduity
of
these
sordid
grooms
before
she
had
completely
recovered
her
recollection
lord
martin
had
seated
himself
in
the
carriage
and
was
drawing
up
some
of
the
blinds
drive
on
said
he
to
the
coachman
who
was
by
this
time
mounted
into
the
box
drive
as
if
the
devil
was
behind
you
the
cavalcade
accordingly
went
forward
there
was
a
servant
on
each
side
of
the
carriage
beside
the
commander
in
chief
who
occasionally
advanced
in
the
front
and
occasionally
brought
up
the
rear
and
whither
said
the
affrighted
delia
whither
are
we
going
this
can
not
be
the
way
to
southampton
what
do
you
mean
but
ah
it
is
too
plain
why
else
this
impotence
of
insult
endeavouring
to
disengage
her
hands
and
she
turned
from
him
in
a
rage
of
indignation
ah
cried
his
lordship
do
not
avert
those
brilliant
eyes
turn
them
towards
me
and
they
will
outshine
the
lustre
of
the
morn
and
i
shall
perceive
nothing
of
the
sun
even
when
he
gains
his
meridian
height
and
thou
despicable
wretch
is
this
thy
shallow
plan
and
what
dost
thou
think
to
do
with
me
mountains
shall
sooner
bend
their
lofty
summits
to
the
earth
than
i
will
ever
waste
a
thought
on
thee
do
with
thee
my
fairest
cried
the
peer
why
marry
thee
dost
thou
think
that
the
paltry
damon
shall
get
the
better
of
my
eagle
genius
no
fortune
now
unfurls
my
standard
and
i
drive
the
before
me
boastful
empty
coward
thou
darest
not
even
brave
a
woman
rage
if
my
hands
were
at
liberty
i
would
tear
out
those
insolent
eyes
thou
gentlest
of
thy
sex
charm
me
with
that
angel
for
though
thou
dealest
in
threats
abuse
and
proud
defiance
is
heaven
to
hear
such
was
the
courtship
that
passed
between
our
heroine
and
her
triumphant
admirer
they
had
new
proceeded
twenty
miles
and
the
midnight
bell
had
tolled
near
half
an
hour
they
had
passed
through
one
turnpike
and
delia
had
endeavoured
by
cries
and
prayers
to
obtain
some
assistance
but
the
person
who
opened
to
them
was
alone
and
though
ever
so
desirous
could
not
have
resisted
such
a
cavalcade
beside
this
the
pimp
told
him
a
plausible
story
of
a
wanton
wife
and
an
injured
husband
with
the
particulars
of
which
we
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
trouble
our
readers
they
had
also
seen
one
foot
passenger
and
two
horsemen
but
they
were
eluded
and
amused
by
a
repetition
of
the
same
stratagem
delia
having
exhausted
her
first
rage
and
astonishment
had
now
remained
for
some
time
silent
she
revolved
in
her
mind
all
the
particulars
of
her
situation
she
had
at
first
considered
her
ravisher
in
no
other
light
than
as
hateful
and
despicable
but
she
was
now
compelled
to
regard
this
venomous
little
animal
as
the
arbiter
of
her
fate
and
the
master
of
her
fortunes
she
reflected
with
horror
how
much
she
was
in
his
power
what
ill
usage
he
might
inflict
and
to
what
extremities
he
might
reduce
her
she
now
seriously
thought
of
exerting
herself
to
melt
him
into
pity
and
to
persuade
him
by
every
argument
she
could
invent
to
spare
and
to
release
her
ah
where
thought
she
is
my
damon
why
does
not
he
appear
to
succour
me
alas
what
distresses
what
agonies
may
he
not
even
now
endure
full
of
these
and
a
thousand
other
tormenting
reflections
she
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
lord
martin
drew
from
his
pocket
a
clean
cambric
handkerchief
and
carefully
unfolding
it
wiped
away
the
drops
as
they
fell
loveliest
of
creatures
said
he
by
the
murmuring
of
thy
voice
the
heaving
of
thy
bosom
the
distraction
of
thy
looks
and
by
these
tears
i
should
imagine
thou
wert
uneasy
ah
cried
delia
unheedful
of
his
words
what
shall
i
say
to
move
him
oh
talk
for
ever
replied
his
lordship
the
winds
shall
forget
to
whistle
and
the
seas
to
roar
noisy
mobs
shall
cease
their
huzzas
and
the
din
of
war
be
still
for
there
is
music
in
thy
voice
oh
exclaimed
our
heroine
let
one
touch
of
compassion
approach
thy
soul
indeed
my
lord
i
can
never
have
you
release
me
and
i
will
forgive
what
is
past
and
damon
shall
never
notice
it
zounds
and
fire
cried
the
peer
dost
thou
think
to
prevail
with
me
by
the
motives
of
a
coward
but
why
dost
thou
talk
of
damon
look
on
me
behold
this
purple
coat
and
fine
think
on
my
estate
and
think
on
my
title
but
at
this
moment
the
oratory
of
his
lordship
ceased
to
be
heard
at
a
small
distance
there
appeared
two
persons
the
one
on
foot
and
whose
air
so
far
as
it
could
be
perceived
by
the
imperfect
light
was
genteel
and
the
other
on
horseback
engaged
in
earnest
conference
as
the
carriage
drew
towards
them
delia
exclaimed
in
a
piercing
but
pathetic
voice
help
help
for
god
sake
rape
murder
help
the
voice
immediately
caught
the
young
gentleman
on
foot
who
approached
the
but
before
we
proceed
any
farther
we
will
inform
our
readers
who
these
persons
were
the
gentleman
on
foot
was
godfrey
he
was
on
a
visit
to
a
sister
who
lived
very
near
the
spot
upon
which
he
now
stood
she
was
married
to
a
substantial
yeoman
who
rented
an
estate
in
this
place
the
property
of
lord
thomas
villiers
the
beautiful
scenes
of
nature
were
particularly
congenial
to
the
elegant
said
contemplative
mind
of
godfrey
and
he
had
now
as
was
frequently
his
custom
strolled
out
to
enjoy
the
calm
serenity
and
the
splendid
beauty
of
a
midnight
scene
the
man
on
was
a
thief
taker
who
just
before
the
carriage
had
driven
up
had
without
ceremony
accosted
godfrey
with
his
enquiries
and
a
description
of
the
person
of
whom
he
was
in
pursuit
chapter
ix
dismisses
the
godfrey
in
a
resolute
tone
called
out
to
the
coachman
to
stop
and
not
contented
with
a
verbal
mandate
he
rushed
before
the
horses
and
brandishing
a
club
he
held
in
his
hand
bid
the
driver
proceed
at
his
peril
drive
on
said
lord
martin
thrusting
his
head
out
at
the
window
drive
on
and
be
damned
to
you
at
this
moment
the
pimp
rode
up
it
is
nothing
said
he
but
a
poor
gentleman
who
has
just
forced
his
wife
from
the
arms
of
a
gallant
oh
no
cried
delia
i
am
not
his
wife
i
am
an
innocent
woman
whom
he
has
forced
from
her
father
and
her
lover
the
thief
taker
out
of
curiosity
rode
forward
that
said
he
fixing
his
eye
upon
the
pimp
that
is
the
very
rascal
i
am
in
search
of
the
pimp
who
had
only
been
borrowed
by
lord
martin
of
one
of
his
more
experienced
acquaintance
no
sooner
heard
the
sound
than
accounting
for
it
with
infinite
facility
and
readiness
of
mind
he
turned
about
his
horse
and
attempted
to
fly
one
of
the
footmen
naturally
a
coward
and
terrified
at
these
incidents
with
the
meaning
of
which
he
was
unacquainted
imitated
his
example
the
other
came
forward
to
the
assistance
of
his
master
and
was
laid
prostrate
upon
the
ground
by
godfrey
with
one
blow
the
thief
taker
had
the
start
of
the
pimp
and
overtook
him
in
a
moment
godfrey
now
opened
the
door
of
the
carriage
but
the
little
peer
was
prepared
for
this
incident
and
having
his
sword
drawn
made
a
sudden
pass
at
our
generous
the
latter
with
infinite
agility
leaped
aside
and
lifting
up
his
club
shivered
the
sword
into
a
thousand
pieces
death
and
the
devil
pox
confound
you
said
lord
martin
and
endeavoured
to
draw
a
pistol
from
his
pocket
but
the
unsuccessful
pass
he
had
made
had
thrown
him
somewhat
off
his
bias
and
though
he
had
employed
more
than
one
effort
he
had
not
been
able
to
recover
himself
at
this
instant
godfrey
seized
him
by
the
collar
and
with
a
threw
him
into
the
middle
of
the
road
fire
and
his
lordship
had
not
time
to
finish
his
exclamation
the
part
of
the
road
in
which
he
fell
was
exceeding
dirty
the
workmen
had
been
employed
the
preceding
day
in
scraping
the
mud
together
into
a
heap
against
the
bank
and
his
lordship
unable
to
overcome
the
velocity
with
which
he
trundled
along
rolled
into
the
midst
of
it
in
an
instant
he
was
entirely
lost
in
this
soft
receptacle
the
colour
of
his
purple
coat
and
his
lily
white
could
no
longer
be
distinguished
the
coachman
perceiving
the
disaster
of
his
lord
now
leaped
from
the
box
godfrey
had
scarcely
had
time
to
reduce
this
new
antagonist
to
a
state
of
inactivity
before
the
footman
upon
whom
he
had
first
displayed
his
prowess
began
to
discover
some
signs
of
life
he
might
have
been
yet
overpowered
in
spite
of
all
his
valour
and
presence
of
mind
if
the
house
of
his
had
not
fortunately
been
so
near
that
the
shrieks
of
delia
and
the
altercation
of
her
ravishers
reached
it
the
honest
farmer
was
at
the
window
in
a
moment
and
perceiving
that
his
brother
was
engaged
in
the
affray
he
huddled
on
his
clothes
with
all
expedition
and
now
appeared
in
the
highway
the
victory
was
immediately
decided
the
footman
perceiving
this
new
reinforcement
did
not
dare
to
act
upon
the
offensive
and
godfrey
mounted
into
the
chariot
to
assist
our
heroine
he
now
first
perceived
that
her
hands
were
manacled
from
this
restraint
however
he
suddenly
disengaged
her
and
taking
her
in
his
arms
out
of
the
carriage
he
delivered
her
to
his
sister
who
advanced
at
this
moment
the
footman
assisted
by
the
humanity
of
the
farmer
was
now
employed
in
raising
his
master
his
lordship
made
the
most
pitiable
figure
that
can
be
imagined
his
features
as
well
as
his
dress
wore
an
appearance
perfectly
uniform
whither
would
you
convey
him
said
godfrey
who
was
now
returned
what
shall
we
do
with
him
oh
and
please
you
sir
said
the
footman
his
lordship
has
a
house
about
half
a
mile
off
lord
martin
now
first
discovered
some
marks
of
sensibility
and
his
goary
his
lordship
exclaimed
the
yeoman
sure
it
can
not
be
yet
it
is
by
my
soul
i
can
not
tell
whether
it
be
lord
martin
or
no
the
coachman
now
rose
from
the
ground
and
began
with
a
profound
bow
to
his
master
and
please
your
honour
said
he
we
have
made
a
sad
day
work
of
it
your
worship
makes
but
a
pitiful
figure
faugh
i
think
as
how
if
i
dared
say
so
much
begging
your
honour
pardon
that
your
lordship
stinks
put
him
into
the
carriage
cried
godfrey
and
drive
him
home
lord
martin
now
first
recovered
his
tongue
and
wiping
away
the
mud
from
his
eyes
and
so
it
was
you
sir
i
suppose
cried
he
to
whom
i
am
obliged
for
this
catastrophe
but
pox
take
me
if
you
shall
not
hear
of
it
ten
thousand
curses
on
my
wayward
fate
the
devil
take
it
death
and
damnation
during
this
soliloquy
the
servants
were
employed
in
placing
their
lord
in
the
chariot
the
coachman
mounted
the
box
and
by
this
time
they
were
out
of
hearing
godfrey
and
his
brother
now
entered
the
house
delia
was
seated
in
a
chair
her
hair
dishevelled
her
features
disordered
and
her
dress
in
the
most
bewitching
confusion
but
how
much
were
both
the
deliverer
and
the
heroine
surprised
when
they
mutually
recognised
each
others
features
godfrey
made
delia
a
very
polite
compliment
upon
her
escape
and
congratulated
himself
in
the
warmest
language
for
having
been
the
fortunate
instrument
they
now
retired
to
rest
the
next
morning
delia
was
much
better
recovered
from
her
terror
and
fatigue
than
could
have
been
expected
godfrey
however
had
not
thought
it
adviseable
that
she
should
be
removed
that
day
and
had
therefore
set
off
early
in
the
morning
for
southampton
that
he
might
himself
be
the
messenger
of
these
happy
tidings
i
hope
miss
said
wilson
who
attended
our
heroine
that
you
will
dress
yourself
as
well
as
you
can
and
why
cried
delia
do
you
desire
that
i
can
see
nobody
i
can
think
of
nothing
but
my
absent
and
anxious
damon
let
us
hope
replied
the
other
that
he
is
very
well
but
miss
we
expect
lord
thomas
villiers
by
dinner
time
lord
thomas
villiers
exclaimed
delia
in
the
extremest
surprise
yes
cried
wilson
he
is
our
landlord
and
he
always
comes
over
once
about
this
time
of
the
year
alas
said
delia
i
can
see
nobody
but
i
had
rather
meet
any
person
at
this
time
than
lord
thomas
villiers
bless
me
miss
why
i
am
sure
he
is
a
very
good
sort
of
a
gentleman
i
dare
say
he
is
cried
delia
but
indeed
and
indeed
wilson
i
can
not
see
him
pray
oblige
me
in
this
law
well
i
can
not
think
what
objection
you
can
have
there
must
be
something
very
particular
in
it
such
were
the
hints
that
wilson
threw
out
for
the
satisfying
of
her
curiosity
but
delia
was
not
disposed
to
be
more
communicative
the
good
woman
however
with
the
error
of
our
heroine
before
her
eyes
was
determined
not
to
commit
a
similar
fault
lord
thomas
was
therefore
scarcely
arrived
before
she
set
open
the
flood
gates
of
her
eloquence
in
describing
the
rescue
and
the
unrivalled
beauty
of
the
lady
under
her
roof
his
lordship
had
long
had
a
misunderstanding
with
lord
martin
upon
the
subject
of
their
contiguous
estates
as
his
temper
was
not
the
most
gentle
nor
his
memory
upon
these
subjects
the
most
treacherous
he
expressed
his
triumph
in
loud
shouts
and
repeated
horse
laughs
upon
the
recent
defeat
of
his
antagonist
nothing
however
would
content
him
but
a
sight
of
the
lady
that
said
wilson
my
guess
is
too
nice
to
consent
to
you
must
know
she
has
a
particular
dislike
to
your
lordship
a
dislike
to
me
said
the
old
gentleman
whose
curiosity
was
now
more
inflamed
than
even
will
you
be
contented
said
his
kind
hostess
with
a
peep
through
the
key
hole
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
she
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
up
stairs
by
my
foul
said
his
lordship
she
is
the
finest
woman
in
the
world
devil
take
me
if
i
can
contain
myself
and
he
burst
into
the
room
lord
thomas
advanced
a
few
steps
and
then
stopping
clasped
his
hands
why
she
is
an
angel
of
a
woman
and
did
martin
that
dirty
scoundrel
think
he
could
run
away
with
you
impudent
spider
ah
if
my
son
had
fallen
in
love
with
such
a
woman
as
you
i
could
forgive
him
any
thing
and
seizing
her
hand
he
pressed
it
to
his
lips
forgive
me
charmer
cried
he
i
am
an
old
fellow
i
will
do
you
no
harm
delia
though
pleased
with
the
behaviour
of
her
intended
dared
not
yet
discover
herself
to
him
in
the
afternoon
godfrey
and
sir
william
twyford
arrived
damon
agitated
as
he
was
by
the
most
dreadful
images
that
a
troubled
fancy
could
suggest
appeared
in
the
morning
in
a
high
fever
instead
of
being
able
to
hasten
to
the
mistress
of
his
soul
he
was
confined
to
his
bed
and
attended
by
physicians
ha
cried
lord
thomas
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
baronet
and
who
sent
for
you
what
do
you
want
i
think
sir
you
are
the
gentleman
to
whom
i
am
obliged
for
telling
my
son
that
duty
to
parents
is
a
baby
prejudice
that
obstinacy
is
a
heroic
virtue
and
that
fortune
fame
and
friends
are
all
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
whining
passion
which
i
think
you
call
love
my
lord
replied
the
baronet
i
have
done
nothing
of
which
i
feel
any
reason
to
be
ashamed
but
a
subject
more
pressing
calls
for
my
immediate
attention
then
turning
to
delia
give
me
leave
to
congratulate
you
madam
and
heaven
can
tell
how
heartily
i
do
it
upon
the
generous
and
happy
interposition
of
mr
godfrey
and
pray
interrupted
lord
thomas
how
came
you
acquainted
with
that
lady
oh
tell
me
cried
delia
with
an
impatience
not
to
be
restrained
by
modes
and
forms
tell
me
how
does
my
damon
why
is
he
not
here
alas
i
fear
fear
nothing
cried
the
baronet
he
is
safe
he
is
at
your
father
house
and
impatient
to
see
you
and
is
this
the
lady
cried
lord
thomas
of
whom
my
son
is
enamoured
but
he
shall
not
disobey
me
i
will
never
permit
it
sir
if
this
be
the
lady
i
will
give
her
to
him
with
my
own
hand
but
where
is
the
ungracious
rascal
why
does
not
he
appear
nothing
be
assured
said
the
baronet
but
reasons
of
the
last
importance
could
have
kept
him
back
in
so
interesting
a
moment
alas
i
fear
cried
delia
since
you
endeavour
to
conceal
them
from
me
they
are
reasons
of
the
most
afflicting
nature
it
is
in
vain
replied
sir
william
to
endeavour
at
concealment
your
son
turning
to
lord
thomas
villiers
is
confined
to
his
bed
the
anxiety
and
fatigue
that
he
suffered
in
consequence
of
the
extraordinary
step
of
lord
martin
have
thrown
him
into
a
fever
but
be
not
uneasy
my
delia
taking
her
hand
there
is
no
danger
one
sigh
one
look
from
you
will
restore
him
ten
thousand
curses
exclaimed
the
father
upon
the
head
of
the
contemptible
misbegotten
ravisher
but
let
us
make
haste
i
am
glad
however
that
my
rogue
of
a
son
is
a
little
punished
for
his
impertinence
let
us
make
haste
saying
this
he
ordered
the
horses
to
his
chariot
and
the
whole
company
prepared
to
set
out
for
southampton
immediately
the
only
business
which
remained
was
the
dispatching
a
message
which
was
done
by
one
of
sir
william
servants
from
godfrey
to
lord
martin
announcing
his
name
and
informing
his
lordship
that
he
was
to
be
met
with
any
time
in
the
ensuing
week
at
moreland
lord
martin
was
a
good
deal
bruised
and
enfeebled
with
the
adventure
of
the
preceding
evening
he
had
been
obliged
to
undergo
a
lustration
of
near
an
hour
before
he
could
be
put
to
bed
he
was
just
risen
when
the
message
was
delivered
zounds
cried
the
peer
he
is
is
he
and
so
this
fellow
whom
nobody
knows
has
the
impudence
to
snub
me
by
my
title
and
all
the
blood
of
my
ancestors
he
is
not
worthy
of
my
sword
i
will
have
him
assassinated
i
will
hire
some
blackguards
to
seize
him
and
bind
him
in
my
presence
and
i
will
bastinado
him
with
my
own
hand
furies
and
curses
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
oh
this
confounded
vanity
not
contented
with
one
disgrace
i
have
brought
upon
myself
another
ten
times
more
mortifying
than
the
first
by
tartarus
and
all
the
infernal
gods
i
believe
i
had
better
let
it
rest
where
it
is
wretch
wretch
that
i
am
and
he
threw
himself
on
the
bed
in
an
agony
of
despair
damon
had
slept
little
the
preceding
night
and
his
slumbers
had
been
disturbed
with
a
thousand
horrible
imaginations
the
first
person
who
appeared
in
his
chamber
the
next
morning
he
addressed
with
where
where
is
she
where
is
my
delia
my
life
my
soul
the
mistress
of
my
fate
ah
why
do
you
look
so
haggard
so
unconsoling
you
have
heard
nothing
of
her
give
me
my
clothes
i
will
pursue
her
to
the
world
end
i
will
find
her
though
she
be
hid
deep
as
the
centre
sir
be
pacified
said
the
servant
she
is
safe
safe
cried
our
lover
why
then
does
she
not
appear
to
comfort
me
but
haste
i
will
fly
to
her
i
will
clasp
i
will
lock
her
in
my
arms
no
nothing
not
all
the
powers
on
earth
shall
ever
part
us
more
sir
she
is
not
in
the
house
not
in
the
house
cried
damon
starting
ha
say
i
will
not
be
cheated
on
thy
life
do
not
trifle
with
my
impatience
at
this
moment
godfrey
entered
the
room
who
is
there
cried
damon
starting
at
every
whisper
it
is
your
friend
said
godfrey
a
friend
that
owes
you
much
and
would
willingly
pay
you
something
back
again
i
do
not
understand
you
replied
our
hero
i
can
talk
of
nothing
but
my
delia
oh
delia
delia
i
will
teach
thy
name
to
all
the
echoes
i
will
send
it
with
every
wind
to
heaven
ever
ever
shall
it
dwell
upon
my
lips
delia
replied
the
other
is
in
safety
i
have
been
so
happy
as
to
rescue
her
ha
sayest
thou
let
me
look
upon
thee
well
i
am
somewhat
disordered
but
i
think
thy
name
is
godfrey
thou
shouldst
not
deceive
me
thou
art
not
old
in
falsehood
i
do
not
deceive
thee
on
my
life
i
do
not
exclaimed
godfrey
with
emotion
compose
thyself
for
a
few
hours
or
ever
thou
shalt
see
the
setting
sun
i
will
put
thy
delia
into
thy
arms
again
damon
was
somewhat
composed
by
these
assurances
no
voice
like
that
of
godfrey
had
power
to
sooth
his
mind
to
serenity
but
though
he
sought
to
restrain
himself
he
listened
to
every
noise
he
started
at
the
sound
of
every
foot
and
the
rattle
of
a
carriage
in
the
street
agitated
his
soul
almost
to
frenzy
why
does
not
she
come
what
can
delay
her
i
have
counted
every
moment
i
have
waited
whole
ages
i
see
i
see
that
every
thing
conspires
to
cheat
and
to
distract
me
damon
has
not
one
friend
left
to
whisper
in
his
ear
to
whisper
what
that
delia
is
no
more
that
all
her
beauties
are
defaced
by
some
sacrilegious
hand
that
all
her
heaven
of
charms
have
been
rifled
oh
no
i
must
not
think
of
that
but
hark
i
thought
i
heard
a
sound
but
it
is
delirium
all
sure
sure
it
comes
this
way
i
will
listen
but
this
once
the
door
of
the
chamber
now
flew
open
but
oh
what
object
caught
the
raptured
eye
of
damon
he
was
just
risen
it
is
it
is
my
delia
and
they
flew
into
each
others
arms
but
having
embraced
for
a
moment
damon
took
hold
of
her
hand
and
held
her
from
him
let
me
look
at
thee
and
is
it
delia
and
art
thou
safe
unhurt
i
would
not
be
mistaken
yes
i
am
she
and
ten
times
more
my
damon
than
ever
it
is
enough
i
am
contented
but
hark
who
comes
there
sure
it
is
not
the
brutal
ravisher
no
cried
he
in
a
voice
of
surprise
it
is
my
father
lord
thomas
villiers
who
had
been
a
witness
of
this
scene
could
restrain
himself
no
longer
come
to
my
arms
thy
father
arms
cried
he
and
let
me
bless
thee
stay
stay
cried
damon
yes
i
know
thee
well
but
i
will
never
be
separated
from
her
any
more
i
will
laugh
at
the
authority
of
a
parent
tyranny
and
tortures
shall
not
rend
me
from
her
the
authority
of
a
parent
replied
lord
thomas
shall
never
more
be
employed
to
counteract
thy
wishes
i
myself
will
join
your
hands
the
constitution
of
damon
was
so
full
of
sensibility
that
it
was
some
days
before
he
was
completely
recovered
in
the
mean
time
the
amours
of
sir
william
twyford
and
hartley
continually
ripened
and
it
was
proposed
that
the
three
parties
should
be
united
in
the
same
day
and
now
said
damon
i
have
but
one
care
more
one
additional
exertion
to
set
my
mind
at
ease
my
godfrey
i
owe
thee
more
than
kingdoms
can
repay
tell
me
instruct
me
what
can
i
do
to
serve
you
damon
must
be
the
most
contemptible
of
villains
if
he
could
think
his
felicity
complete
when
his
godfrey
was
unhappy
think
not
of
me
said
godfrey
i
am
happy
in
the
way
that
nature
intended
beyond
even
the
power
of
damon
to
make
me
since
i
saw
you
a
favourable
change
has
taken
place
in
my
circumstances
in
spite
of
various
obstacles
i
have
brought
a
tragedy
upon
the
stage
and
it
has
met
with
distinguished
success
my
former
crosses
and
mortifications
are
all
forgotten
philosophers
may
tell
us
that
reputation
and
the
immortality
of
a
name
are
all
but
an
airy
shadow
enough
for
me
that
nature
from
my
earliest
infancy
led
me
to
place
my
first
delight
in
these
i
envy
not
kings
their
sceptres
i
envy
not
statesmen
their
power
i
envy
not
damon
his
love
and
his
delia
next
to
the
pursuits
of
honour
and
truth
my
soul
is
conscious
to
but
one
wish
that
of
having
my
name
enrolled
in
however
inferior
a
rank
with
a
homer
and
a
horace
a
livy
and
a
cicero
the
next
day
the
proposed
weddings
took
place
it
is
natural
perhaps
at
the
conclusion
of
such
a
narrative
as
this
to
represent
them
all
as
happy
but
we
are
bound
to
adhere
to
nature
and
truth
hartley
and
his
politician
for
some
time
struggled
for
superiority
but
in
the
end
the
eagle
genius
of
sophia
soared
aloft
sir
william
though
he
married
a
woman
good
natured
and
destitute
of
vice
found
something
more
insipid
in
marriage
than
he
had
previously
apprehended
for
damon
and
his
delia
they
were
amiable
and
constant
though
their
hearts
were
in
the
highest
degree
susceptible
and
affectionate
the
first
ebullition
of
passion
could
not
last
for
ever
but
it
was
succeeded
by
feast
of
reason
and
the
flow
of
their
hours
were
sped
with
the
calmness
of
tranquility
when
they
saw
each
other
no
longer
with
transport
they
saw
each
other
with
complacency
and
so
long
as
they
live
they
will
doubtless
afford
the
most
striking
demonstration
that
marriage
when
it
unites
two
gentle
souls
and
meaned
by
nature
for
each
other
when
it
is
blest
of
heaven
and
accompanied
with
reason
and
discretion
is
the
sweetest
and
the
fairest
of
all
the
bands
of
society
the
end
