conclusion
a
whisper
to
the
reader
there
is
no
character
howsoever
good
and
fine
but
it
can
be
destroyed
by
ridicule
howsoever
poor
and
witless
observe
the
ass
for
instance
his
character
is
about
perfect
he
is
the
choicest
spirit
among
all
the
humbler
animals
yet
see
what
ridicule
has
brought
him
to
instead
of
feeling
complimented
when
we
are
called
an
ass
we
are
left
in
wilson
calendar
a
person
who
is
ignorant
of
legal
matters
is
always
liable
to
make
mistakes
when
he
tries
to
photograph
a
court
scene
with
his
pen
and
so
i
was
not
willing
to
let
the
law
chapters
in
this
book
go
to
press
without
first
subjecting
them
to
rigid
and
exhausting
revision
and
correction
by
a
trained
barrister
if
that
is
what
they
are
called
these
chapters
are
right
now
in
every
detail
for
they
were
rewritten
under
the
immediate
eye
of
william
hicks
who
studied
law
part
of
a
while
in
southwest
missouri
years
ago
and
then
came
over
here
to
florence
for
his
health
and
is
still
helping
for
exercise
and
board
in
macaroni
vermicelli
shed
which
is
up
the
back
alley
as
you
turn
around
the
corner
out
of
the
piazza
del
duomo
just
beyond
the
house
where
that
stone
that
dante
used
to
sit
on
six
hundred
years
ago
is
let
into
the
wall
when
he
let
on
to
be
watching
them
build
giotto
campanile
and
yet
always
got
tired
looking
as
soon
as
beatrice
passed
along
on
her
way
to
get
a
chunk
of
chestnut
cake
to
defend
herself
with
in
case
of
a
ghibelline
outbreak
before
she
got
to
school
at
the
same
old
stand
where
they
sell
the
same
old
cake
to
this
day
and
it
is
just
as
light
and
good
as
it
was
then
too
and
this
is
not
flattery
far
from
it
he
was
a
little
rusty
on
his
law
but
he
rubbed
up
for
this
book
and
those
two
or
three
legal
chapters
are
right
and
straight
now
he
told
me
so
himself
given
under
my
hand
this
second
day
of
january
at
the
villa
viviani
village
of
settignano
three
miles
back
of
florence
on
the
hills
the
same
certainly
affording
the
most
charming
view
to
be
found
on
this
planet
and
with
it
the
most
dreamlike
and
enchanting
sunsets
to
be
found
in
any
planet
or
even
in
any
solar
system
and
given
too
in
the
swell
room
of
the
house
with
the
busts
of
cerretani
senators
and
other
grandees
of
this
line
looking
approvingly
down
upon
me
as
they
used
to
look
down
upon
dante
and
mutely
asking
me
to
adopt
them
into
my
family
which
i
do
with
pleasure
for
my
remotest
ancestors
are
but
spring
chickens
compared
with
these
robed
and
stately
antiques
and
it
will
be
a
great
and
satisfying
lift
for
me
that
six
hundred
years
will
mark
twain
chapter
wins
his
name
tell
the
truth
or
trump
but
get
the
calendar
the
scene
of
this
chronicle
is
the
town
of
dawson
landing
on
the
missouri
side
of
the
mississippi
half
a
day
journey
per
steamboat
below
louis
in
it
was
a
snug
little
collection
of
modest
and
frame
dwellings
whose
whitewashed
exteriors
were
almost
concealed
from
sight
by
climbing
tangles
of
honeysuckles
and
each
of
these
pretty
homes
had
a
garden
in
front
fenced
with
white
palings
and
opulently
stocked
with
hollyhocks
marigolds
and
other
flowers
while
on
the
of
the
houses
stood
wooden
boxes
containing
plants
and
pots
in
which
grew
a
breed
of
geranium
whose
spread
of
intensely
red
blossoms
accented
the
prevailing
pink
tint
of
the
like
an
explosion
of
flame
when
there
was
room
on
the
ledge
outside
of
the
pots
and
boxes
for
a
cat
the
cat
was
there
in
sunny
weather
stretched
at
full
length
asleep
and
blissful
with
her
furry
belly
to
the
sun
and
a
paw
curved
over
her
nose
then
that
house
was
complete
and
its
contentment
and
peace
were
made
manifest
to
the
world
by
this
symbol
whose
testimony
is
infallible
a
home
without
a
cat
and
a
and
properly
revered
cat
may
be
a
perfect
home
perhaps
but
how
can
it
prove
title
all
along
the
streets
on
both
sides
at
the
outer
edge
of
the
brick
sidewalks
stood
with
trunks
protected
by
wooden
boxing
and
these
furnished
shade
for
summer
and
a
sweet
fragrance
in
spring
when
the
clusters
of
buds
came
forth
the
main
street
one
block
back
from
the
river
and
running
parallel
with
it
was
the
sole
business
street
it
was
six
blocks
long
and
in
each
block
two
or
three
brick
stores
three
stories
high
towered
above
interjected
bunches
of
little
frame
shops
swinging
signs
creaked
in
the
wind
the
street
whole
length
the
pole
which
indicates
nobility
proud
and
ancient
along
the
canals
of
venice
indicated
merely
the
humble
barber
shop
along
the
main
street
of
dawson
landing
on
a
chief
corner
stood
a
lofty
unpainted
pole
wreathed
from
top
to
bottom
with
tin
pots
and
pans
and
cups
the
chief
tinmonger
noisy
notice
to
the
world
when
the
wind
blew
that
his
shop
was
on
hand
for
business
at
that
corner
the
hamlet
front
was
washed
by
the
clear
waters
of
the
great
river
its
body
stretched
itself
rearward
up
a
gentle
incline
its
most
rearward
border
fringed
itself
out
and
scattered
its
houses
about
the
of
the
hills
the
hills
rose
high
inclosing
the
town
in
a
curve
clothed
with
forests
from
foot
to
summit
steamboats
passed
up
and
down
every
hour
or
so
those
belonging
to
the
little
cairo
line
and
the
little
memphis
line
always
stopped
the
big
orleans
liners
stopped
for
hails
only
or
to
land
passengers
or
freight
and
this
was
the
case
also
with
the
great
flotilla
of
transients
these
latter
came
out
of
a
dozen
rivers
the
illinois
the
missouri
the
upper
mississippi
the
ohio
the
monongahela
the
tennessee
the
red
river
the
white
river
and
so
on
and
were
bound
every
whither
and
stocked
with
every
imaginable
comfort
or
necessity
which
the
mississippi
communities
could
want
from
the
frosty
falls
of
anthony
down
through
nine
climates
to
torrid
new
orleans
dawson
landing
was
a
slaveholding
town
with
a
rich
grain
and
pork
country
back
of
it
the
town
was
sleepy
and
comfortable
and
contented
it
was
fifty
years
old
and
was
growing
slowly
very
slowly
in
fact
but
still
it
was
growing
the
chief
citizen
was
york
leicester
driscoll
about
forty
years
old
judge
of
the
county
court
he
was
very
proud
of
his
old
virginian
ancestry
and
in
his
hospitalities
and
his
rather
formal
and
stately
manners
he
kept
up
its
traditions
he
was
fine
and
just
and
generous
to
be
a
gentleman
a
gentleman
without
stain
or
blemish
was
his
only
religion
and
to
it
he
was
always
faithful
he
was
respected
esteemed
and
beloved
by
all
the
community
he
was
well
off
and
was
gradually
adding
to
his
store
he
and
his
wife
were
very
nearly
happy
but
not
quite
for
they
had
no
children
the
longing
for
the
treasure
of
a
child
had
grown
stronger
and
stronger
as
the
years
slipped
away
but
the
blessing
never
came
and
was
never
to
come
with
this
pair
lived
the
judge
widowed
sister
rachel
pratt
and
she
also
was
childless
childless
and
sorrowful
for
that
reason
and
not
to
be
comforted
the
women
were
good
and
commonplace
people
and
did
their
duty
and
had
their
reward
in
clear
consciences
and
the
approbation
they
were
presbyterians
the
judge
was
a
pembroke
howard
lawyer
and
bachelor
aged
about
forty
was
another
old
virginian
grandee
with
proved
descent
from
the
first
families
he
was
a
fine
brave
majestic
creature
a
gentleman
according
to
the
nicest
requirements
of
the
virginia
rule
a
devoted
presbyterian
an
authority
on
the
code
and
a
man
always
courteously
ready
to
stand
up
before
you
in
the
field
if
any
act
or
word
of
his
had
seemed
doubtful
or
suspicious
to
you
and
explain
it
with
any
weapon
you
might
prefer
from
to
artillery
he
was
very
popular
with
the
people
and
was
the
dearest
friend
then
there
was
colonel
cecil
burleigh
essex
another
of
formidable
caliber
however
with
him
we
have
no
concern
percy
northumberland
driscoll
brother
to
the
judge
and
younger
than
he
by
five
years
was
a
married
man
and
had
had
children
around
his
hearthstone
but
they
were
attacked
in
detail
by
measles
croup
and
scarlet
fever
and
this
had
given
the
doctor
a
chance
with
his
effective
antediluvian
methods
so
the
cradles
were
empty
he
was
a
prosperous
man
with
a
good
head
for
speculations
and
his
fortune
was
growing
on
the
of
february
two
boy
babes
were
born
in
his
house
one
to
him
the
other
to
one
of
his
slave
girls
roxana
by
name
roxana
was
twenty
years
old
she
was
up
and
around
the
same
day
with
her
hands
full
for
she
was
tending
both
babies
percy
driscoll
died
within
the
week
roxy
remained
in
charge
of
the
children
she
had
her
own
way
for
driscoll
soon
absorbed
himself
in
his
speculations
and
left
her
to
her
own
devices
in
that
same
month
of
february
dawson
landing
gained
a
new
citizen
this
was
david
wilson
a
young
fellow
of
scotch
parentage
he
had
wandered
to
this
remote
region
from
his
birthplace
in
the
interior
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
seek
his
fortune
he
was
years
old
and
had
finished
a
course
in
an
eastern
law
school
a
couple
of
years
before
he
was
a
homely
freckled
young
fellow
with
an
intelligent
blue
eye
that
had
frankness
and
comradeship
in
it
and
a
covert
twinkle
of
a
pleasant
sort
but
for
an
unfortunate
remark
of
his
he
would
no
doubt
have
entered
at
once
upon
a
successful
career
at
dawson
landing
but
he
made
his
fatal
remark
the
first
day
he
spent
in
the
village
and
it
gaged
him
he
had
just
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
group
of
citizens
when
an
invisible
dog
began
to
yelp
and
snarl
and
howl
and
make
himself
very
comprehensively
disagreeable
whereupon
young
wilson
said
much
as
one
who
is
thinking
aloud
i
wish
i
owned
half
of
that
dog
why
somebody
asked
because
i
would
kill
my
half
the
group
searched
his
face
with
curiosity
with
anxiety
even
but
found
no
light
there
no
expression
that
they
could
read
they
fell
away
from
him
as
from
something
uncanny
and
went
into
privacy
to
discuss
him
one
said
to
be
a
fool
said
another
is
i
reckon
you
better
say
said
he
wished
he
owned
half
of
the
dog
the
idiot
said
a
third
what
did
he
reckon
would
become
of
the
other
half
if
he
killed
his
half
do
you
reckon
he
thought
it
would
live
why
he
must
have
thought
it
unless
he
is
the
downrightest
fool
in
the
world
because
if
he
had
thought
it
he
would
have
wanted
to
own
the
whole
dog
knowing
that
if
he
killed
his
half
and
the
other
half
died
he
would
be
responsible
for
that
half
just
the
same
as
if
he
had
killed
that
half
instead
of
his
own
do
it
look
that
way
to
you
gents
yes
it
does
if
he
owned
one
half
of
the
general
dog
it
would
be
so
if
he
owned
one
end
of
the
dog
and
another
person
owned
the
other
end
it
would
be
so
just
the
same
particularly
in
the
first
case
because
if
you
kill
one
half
of
a
general
dog
there
ai
any
man
that
can
tell
whose
half
it
was
but
if
he
owned
one
end
of
the
dog
maybe
he
could
kill
his
end
of
it
and
no
he
could
either
he
could
and
not
be
responsible
if
the
other
end
died
which
it
would
in
my
opinion
that
man
ai
in
his
right
mind
in
my
opinion
he
hai
got
any
mind
no
said
well
he
a
lummox
anyway
that
what
he
is
said
no
he
a
labrick
just
a
labrick
if
ever
there
was
one
yes
sir
he
a
dam
fool
that
the
way
i
put
him
up
said
no
anybody
can
think
different
that
wants
to
but
those
are
my
sentiments
i
with
you
gentlemen
said
no
perfect
jackass
yes
and
it
ai
going
too
far
to
say
he
is
a
if
he
ai
a
i
ai
no
judge
that
all
wilson
stood
elected
the
incident
was
told
all
over
the
town
and
gravely
discussed
by
everybody
within
a
week
he
had
lost
his
first
name
took
its
place
in
time
he
came
to
be
liked
and
well
liked
too
but
by
that
time
the
nickname
had
got
well
stuck
on
and
it
stayed
that
first
day
verdict
made
him
a
fool
and
he
was
not
able
to
get
it
set
aside
or
even
modified
the
nickname
soon
ceased
to
carry
any
harsh
or
unfriendly
feeling
with
it
but
it
held
its
place
and
was
to
continue
to
hold
its
place
for
twenty
long
years
chapter
ii
driscoll
spares
his
slaves
adam
was
but
human
this
explains
it
all
he
did
not
want
the
apple
for
the
apple
sake
he
wanted
it
only
because
it
was
forbidden
the
mistake
was
in
not
forbidding
the
serpent
then
he
would
have
eaten
the
wilson
calendar
wilson
had
a
trifle
of
money
when
he
arrived
and
he
bought
a
small
house
on
the
extreme
western
verge
of
the
town
between
it
and
judge
driscoll
house
there
was
only
a
grassy
yard
with
a
paling
fence
dividing
the
properties
in
the
middle
he
hired
a
small
office
down
in
the
town
and
hung
out
a
tin
sign
with
these
words
on
it
david
wilson
attorney
and
surveying
conveyancing
etc
but
his
deadly
remark
had
ruined
his
chance
at
least
in
the
law
no
clients
came
he
took
down
his
sign
after
a
while
and
put
it
up
on
his
own
house
with
the
law
features
knocked
out
of
it
it
offered
his
services
now
in
the
humble
capacities
of
and
expert
accountant
now
and
then
he
got
a
job
of
surveying
to
do
and
now
and
then
a
merchant
got
him
to
straighten
out
his
books
with
scotch
patience
and
pluck
he
resolved
to
live
down
his
reputation
and
work
his
way
into
the
legal
field
yet
poor
fellow
he
could
not
foresee
that
it
was
going
to
take
him
such
a
weary
long
time
to
do
it
he
had
a
rich
abundance
of
idle
time
but
it
never
hung
heavy
on
his
hands
for
he
interested
himself
in
every
new
thing
that
was
born
into
the
universe
of
ideas
and
studied
it
and
experimented
upon
it
at
his
house
one
of
his
pet
fads
was
palmistry
to
another
one
he
gave
no
name
neither
would
he
explain
to
anybody
what
its
purpose
was
but
merely
said
it
was
an
amusement
in
fact
he
had
found
that
his
fads
added
to
his
reputation
as
a
therefore
he
was
growing
chary
of
being
too
communicative
about
them
the
fad
without
a
name
was
one
which
dealt
with
people
he
carried
in
his
coat
pocket
a
shallow
box
with
grooves
in
it
and
in
the
grooves
strips
of
glass
five
inches
long
and
three
inches
wide
along
the
lower
edge
of
each
strip
was
pasted
a
slip
of
white
paper
he
asked
people
to
pass
their
hands
through
their
hair
thus
collecting
upon
them
a
thin
coating
of
the
natural
oil
and
then
make
a
on
a
glass
strip
following
it
with
the
mark
of
the
ball
of
each
finger
in
succession
under
this
row
of
faint
he
would
write
a
record
on
the
strip
of
white
paper
thus
john
smith
right
hand
and
add
the
day
of
the
month
and
the
year
then
take
smith
left
hand
on
another
glass
strip
and
add
name
and
date
and
the
words
left
hand
the
strips
were
now
returned
to
the
grooved
box
and
took
their
place
among
what
wilson
called
his
records
he
often
studied
his
records
examining
and
poring
over
them
with
absorbing
interest
until
far
into
the
night
but
what
he
found
there
if
he
found
anything
he
revealed
to
no
one
sometimes
he
copied
on
paper
the
involved
and
delicate
pattern
left
by
the
ball
of
a
finger
and
then
vastly
enlarged
it
with
a
pantograph
so
that
he
could
examine
its
web
of
curving
lines
with
ease
and
convenience
one
sweltering
afternoon
it
was
the
first
day
of
july
he
was
at
work
over
a
set
of
tangled
in
his
which
looked
westward
over
a
stretch
of
vacant
lots
when
a
conversation
outside
disturbed
him
it
was
carried
on
in
yells
which
showed
that
the
people
engaged
in
it
were
not
close
together
say
roxy
how
does
yo
baby
come
on
this
from
the
distant
voice
how
does
you
come
on

this
yell

yo
marster
i
gwine
to
tell
him
so
this
idle
and
aimless
jabber
went
on
and
on
both
parties
enjoying
the
friendly
duel
and
each
well
satisfied
with
his
own
share
of
the
wit
exchanged
for
wit
they
considered
it
wilson
stepped
to
the
window
to
observe
the
combatants
he
could
not
work
while
their
chatter
continued
over
in
the
vacant
lots
was
jasper
young
and
of
magnificent
build
sitting
on
a
wheelbarrow
in
the
pelting
sun
at
work
supposably
whereas
he
was
in
fact
only
preparing
for
it
by
taking
an
hour
rest
before
beginning
in
front
of
wilson
porch
stood
roxy
with
a
local
in
which
sat
her
two
charges
one
at
each
end
and
facing
each
other
from
manner
of
speech
a
stranger
would
have
expected
her
to
be
black
but
she
was
not
only
one
sixteenth
of
her
was
black
and
that
sixteenth
did
not
show
she
was
of
majestic
form
and
stature
her
attitudes
were
imposing
and
statuesque
and
her
gestures
and
movements
distinguished
by
a
noble
and
stately
grace
her
complexion
was
very
fair
with
the
rosy
glow
of
vigorous
health
in
the
cheeks
her
face
was
full
of
character
and
expression
her
eyes
were
brown
and
liquid
and
she
had
a
heavy
suit
of
fine
soft
hair
which
was
also
brown
but
the
fact
was
not
apparent
because
her
head
was
bound
about
with
a
checkered
handkerchief
and
the
hair
was
concealed
under
it
her
face
was
shapely
intelligent
and
comely
even
beautiful
she
had
an
easy
independent
carriage
when
she
was
among
her
own
caste
and
a
high
and
sassy
way
withal
but
of
course
she
was
meek
and
humble
enough
where
white
people
were
to
all
intents
and
purposes
roxy
was
as
white
as
anybody
but
the
one
sixteenth
of
her
which
was
black
outvoted
the
other
fifteen
parts
and
made
her
a
negro
she
was
a
slave
and
salable
as
such
her
child
was
parts
white
and
he
too
was
a
slave
and
by
a
fiction
of
law
and
custom
a
negro
he
had
blue
eyes
and
flaxen
curls
like
his
white
comrade
but
even
the
father
of
the
white
child
was
able
to
tell
the
children
apart
little
as
he
had
commerce
with
them
by
their
clothes
for
the
white
babe
wore
ruffled
soft
muslin
and
a
coral
necklace
while
the
other
wore
merely
a
coarse
shirt
which
barely
reached
to
its
knees
and
no
jewelry
the
white
child
name
was
thomas
à
becket
driscoll
the
other
name
was
valet
de
chambre
no
surname
slaves
had
the
privilege
roxana
had
heard
that
phrase
somewhere
the
fine
sound
of
it
had
pleased
her
ear
and
as
she
had
supposed
it
was
a
name
she
loaded
it
on
to
her
darling
it
soon
got
shorted
to
chambers
of
course
wilson
knew
roxy
by
sight
and
when
the
duel
of
wit
began
to
play
out
he
stepped
outside
to
gather
in
a
record
or
two
jasper
went
to
work
energetically
at
once
perceiving
that
his
leisure
was
observed
wilson
inspected
the
children
and
asked
how
old
are
they
roxy
bofe
de
same
age
sir
five
months
bawn
de
fust
o
they
handsome
little
chaps
one
just
as
handsome
as
the
other
too
a
delighted
smile
exposed
the
girl
white
teeth
and
she
said
bless
yo
soul
misto
wilson
it
nice
o
you
to
say
dat
one
of
ai
a
nigger
mighty
prime
little
nigger
i
says
but
dat
it
mine
o
course
how
do
you
tell
them
apart
roxy
when
they
have
any
clothes
on
roxy
laughed
a
laugh
proportioned
to
her
size
and
said
oh
i
kin
tell
misto
wilson
but
i
bet
marse
percy
could
not
to
save
his
life
wilson
chatted
along
for
awhile
and
presently
got
roxy
for
his
collection
right
hand
and
left
on
a
couple
of
his
glass
strips
then
labeled
and
dated
them
and
took
the
records
of
both
children
and
labeled
and
dated
them
also
two
months
later
on
the
of
september
he
took
this
trio
of
again
he
liked
to
have
a
series
two
or
three
takings
at
intervals
during
the
period
of
childhood
these
to
be
followed
by
others
at
intervals
of
several
years
the
next
day
that
is
to
say
on
the
of
september
something
occurred
which
profoundly
impressed
roxana
driscoll
missed
another
small
sum
of
money
which
is
a
way
of
saying
that
this
was
not
a
new
thing
but
had
happened
before
in
truth
it
had
happened
three
times
before
driscoll
patience
was
exhausted
he
was
a
fairly
humane
man
toward
slaves
and
other
animals
he
was
an
exceedingly
humane
man
toward
the
erring
of
his
own
race
theft
he
could
not
abide
and
plainly
there
was
a
thief
in
his
house
necessarily
the
thief
must
be
one
of
his
negroes
sharp
measures
must
be
taken
he
called
his
servants
before
him
there
were
three
of
these
besides
roxy
a
man
a
woman
and
a
boy
twelve
years
old
they
were
not
related
driscoll
said
you
have
all
been
warned
before
it
has
done
no
good
this
time
i
will
teach
you
a
lesson
i
will
sell
the
thief
which
of
you
is
the
guilty
one
they
all
shuddered
at
the
threat
for
here
they
had
a
good
home
and
a
new
one
was
likely
to
be
a
change
for
the
worse
the
denial
was
general
none
had
stolen
anything
not
money
anyway
a
little
sugar
or
cake
or
honey
or
something
like
that
that
marse
percy
would
mind
or
miss
but
not
money
never
a
cent
of
money
they
were
eloquent
in
their
protestations
but
driscoll
was
not
moved
by
them
he
answered
each
in
turn
with
a
stern
name
the
thief
the
truth
was
all
were
guilty
but
roxana
she
suspected
that
the
others
were
guilty
but
she
did
not
know
them
to
be
so
she
was
horrified
to
think
how
near
she
had
come
to
being
guilty
herself
she
had
been
saved
in
the
nick
of
time
by
a
revival
in
the
colored
methodist
church
a
fortnight
before
at
which
time
and
place
she
got
religion
the
very
next
day
after
that
gracious
experience
while
her
change
of
style
was
fresh
upon
her
and
she
was
vain
of
her
purified
condition
her
master
left
a
couple
dollars
lying
unprotected
on
his
desk
and
she
happened
upon
that
temptation
when
she
was
polishing
around
with
a
she
looked
at
the
money
awhile
with
a
steady
rising
resentment
then
she
burst
out
with
dad
blame
dat
revival
i
wisht
it
had
put
off
till
then
she
covered
the
tempter
with
a
book
and
another
member
of
the
kitchen
cabinet
got
it
she
made
this
sacrifice
as
a
matter
of
religious
etiquette
as
a
thing
necessary
just
now
but
by
no
means
to
be
wrested
into
a
precedent
no
a
week
or
two
would
limber
up
her
piety
then
she
would
be
rational
again
and
the
next
two
dollars
that
got
left
out
in
the
cold
would
find
a
comforter
and
she
could
name
the
comforter
was
she
bad
was
she
worse
than
the
general
run
of
her
race
no
they
had
an
unfair
show
in
the
battle
of
life
and
they
held
it
no
sin
to
take
military
advantage
of
the
enemy
in
a
small
way
in
a
small
way
but
not
in
a
large
one
they
would
smouch
provisions
from
the
pantry
whenever
they
got
a
chance
or
a
brass
thimble
or
a
cake
of
wax
or
an
or
a
paper
of
needles
or
a
silver
spoon
or
a
dollar
bill
or
small
articles
of
clothing
or
any
other
property
of
light
value
and
so
far
were
they
from
considering
such
reprisals
sinful
that
they
would
go
to
church
and
shout
and
pray
the
loudest
and
sincerest
with
their
plunder
in
their
pockets
a
farm
had
to
be
kept
heavily
padlocked
for
even
the
colored
deacon
himself
could
not
resist
a
ham
when
providence
showed
him
in
a
dream
or
otherwise
where
such
a
thing
hung
lonesome
and
longed
for
some
one
to
love
but
with
a
hundred
hanging
before
him
the
deacon
would
not
take
two
that
is
on
the
same
night
on
frosty
nights
the
humane
negro
prowler
would
warm
the
end
of
a
plank
and
put
it
up
under
the
cold
claws
of
chickens
roosting
in
a
tree
a
drowsy
hen
would
step
on
to
the
comfortable
board
softly
clucking
her
gratitude
and
the
prowler
would
dump
her
into
his
bag
and
later
into
his
stomach
perfectly
sure
that
in
taking
this
trifle
from
the
man
who
daily
robbed
him
of
an
inestimable
treasure
his
liberty
he
was
not
committing
any
sin
that
god
would
remember
against
him
in
the
last
great
day
name
the
thief
for
the
fourth
time
driscoll
had
said
it
and
always
in
the
same
hard
tone
and
now
he
added
these
words
of
awful
import
i
give
you
one
minute
he
took
out
his
watch
if
at
the
end
of
that
time
you
have
not
confessed
i
will
not
only
sell
all
four
of
you
but
i
will
sell
you
down
the
river
it
was
equivalent
to
condemning
them
to
hell
no
missouri
negro
doubted
this
roxy
reeled
in
her
tracks
and
the
color
vanished
out
of
her
face
the
others
dropped
to
their
knees
as
if
they
had
been
shot
tears
gushed
from
their
eyes
their
supplicating
hands
went
up
and
three
answers
came
in
the
one
instant
i
done
it
i
done
it
i
done
it
have
mercy
marster
lord
have
mercy
on
us
po
niggers
very
good
said
the
master
putting
up
his
watch
i
will
sell
you
here
though
you
do
deserve
it
you
ought
to
be
sold
down
the
river
the
culprits
flung
themselves
prone
in
an
ecstasy
of
gratitude
and
kissed
his
feet
declaring
that
they
would
never
forget
his
goodness
and
never
cease
to
pray
for
him
as
long
as
they
lived
they
were
sincere
for
like
a
god
he
had
stretched
forth
his
mighty
hand
and
closed
the
gates
of
hell
against
them
he
knew
himself
that
he
had
done
a
noble
and
gracious
thing
and
was
privately
well
pleased
with
his
magnanimity
and
that
night
he
set
the
incident
down
in
his
diary
so
that
his
son
might
read
it
in
after
years
and
be
thereby
moved
to
deeds
of
gentleness
and
humanity
himself
chapter
iii
roxy
plays
a
shrewd
trick
whoever
has
lived
long
enough
to
find
out
what
life
is
knows
how
deep
a
debt
of
gratitude
we
owe
to
adam
the
first
great
benefactor
of
our
race
he
brought
death
into
the
wilson
calendar
percy
driscoll
slept
well
the
night
he
saved
his
from
going
down
the
river
but
no
wink
of
sleep
visited
roxy
eyes
a
profound
terror
had
taken
possession
of
her
her
child
could
grow
up
and
be
sold
down
the
river
the
thought
crazed
her
with
horror
if
she
dozed
and
lost
herself
for
a
moment
the
next
moment
she
was
on
her
feet
flying
to
her
child
cradle
to
see
if
it
was
still
there
then
she
would
gather
it
to
her
heart
and
pour
out
her
love
upon
it
in
a
frenzy
of
kisses
moaning
crying
and
saying
dey
oh
dey
yo
po
mammy
will
kill
you
fust
once
when
she
was
tucking
it
back
in
its
cradle
again
the
other
child
nestled
in
its
sleep
and
attracted
her
attention
she
went
and
stood
over
it
a
long
time
communing
with
herself
what

my
po
baby

dat
he
could
have

en

she
paused
awhile
thinking
then
she
burst
into
wild
sobbings
again
and
turned
away
saying
oh
i
got
to
kill
my
chile

she
gathered
her
baby
to
her
bosom
now
and
began
to
smother
it
with
caresses
mammy

to
kill

po
niggers
down
the
river
over
yonder
she
started
toward
the
door
crooning
to
the
child
and
hushing
it
midway
she
stopped
suddenly
she
had
caught
sight
of
her
new
sunday
gown
a
cheap
thing
a
conflagration
of
gaudy
colors
and
fantastic
figures
she
surveyed
it
wistfully
longingly
hai
ever
wore
it
yet
she
said
en
it
jist
lovely
then
she
nodded
her
head
in
response
to
a
pleasant
idea
and
added
no
i
gwine
to
be
fished
out
wid
everybody
lookin
at
me
in
dis
ole
she
put
down
the
child
and
made
the
change
she
looked
in
the
glass
and
was
astonished
at
her
beauty
she
resolved
to
make
her
perfect
she
took
off
her
and
dressed
her
glossy
wealth
of
hair
like
white
folks
she
added
some
odds
and
ends
of
rather
lurid
ribbon
and
a
spray
of
atrocious
artificial
flowers
finally
she
threw
over
her
shoulders
a
fluffy
thing
called
a
cloud
in
that
day
which
was
of
a
blazing
red
complexion
then
she
was
ready
for
the
tomb
she
gathered
up
her
baby
once
more
but
when
her
eye
fell
upon
its
miserably
short
little
gray
shirt
and
noted
the
contrast
between
its
pauper
shabbiness
and
her
own
volcanic
irruption
of
infernal
splendors
her
was
touched
and
she
was
ashamed
no

too
indelicate
fo
dis
place
by
this
time
she
had
stripped
off
the
shirt
now
she
clothed
the
naked
little
creature
in
one
of
thomas
à
becket
snowy
long
with
its
bright
blue
bows
and
dainty
flummery
of
ruffles
dah
now
you
fixed
she
propped
the
child
in
a
chair
and
stood
off
to
inspect
it
straightway
her
eyes
began
to
widen
with
astonishment
and
admiration
and
she
clapped
her
hands
and
cried
out
why
it
do
beat
all
i
never
knowed
you
was
so
lovely
marse
tommy
ai
a
bit
puttier
not

single
bit
she
stepped
over
and
glanced
at
the
other
infant
she
flung
a
glance
back
at
her
own
then
one
more
at
the
heir
of
the
house
now
a
strange
light
dawned
in
her
eyes
and
in
a
moment
she
was
lost
in
thought
she
seemed
in
a
trance
when
she
came
out
of
it
she
muttered
when
i
in
de
tub
yistiddy
his
own
pappy
asked
me
which
of
was
she
began
to
move
about
like
one
in
a
dream
she
undressed
thomas
à
becket
stripping
him
of
everything
and
put
the
shirt
on
him
she
put
his
coral
necklace
on
her
own
child
neck
then
she
placed
the
children
side
by
side
and
after
earnest
inspection
she
muttered
now

she
put
the
heir
of
the
house
in
her
own
child
unpainted
pine
cradle
and
said
contemplating
its
slumbering
form
uneasily

she
flung
herself
on
her
bed
and
began
to
think
and
toss
toss
and
think
by
and
by
she
sat
suddenly
upright
for
a
comforting
thought
had
flown
through
her
worried
mind
no

chambers
does
you
want
me
to
take
to
you
as
she
progressed
with
her
practice
she
was
surprised
to
see
how
steadily
and
surely
the
awe
which
had
kept
her
tongue
reverent
and
her
manner
humble
toward
her
young
master
was
transferring
itself
to
her
speech
and
manner
toward
the
usurper
and
how
similarly
handy
she
was
becoming
in
transferring
her
motherly
curtness
of
speech
and
peremptoriness
of
manner
to
the
unlucky
heir
of
the
ancient
house
of
driscoll
she
took
occasional
rests
from
practising
and
absorbed
herself
in
calculating
her
chances

gave
roxy
no
trouble
of
course
the
master
gave
her
none
for
one
of
his
speculations
was
in
jeopardy
and
his
mind
was
so
occupied
that
he
hardly
saw
the
children
when
he
looked
at
them
and
all
roxy
had
to
do
was
to
get
them
both
into
a
gale
of
laughter
when
he
came
about
then
their
faces
were
mainly
cavities
exposing
gums
and
he
was
gone
again
before
the
spasm
passed
and
the
little
creatures
resumed
a
human
aspect
within
a
few
days
the
fate
of
the
speculation
became
so
dubious
that
percy
went
away
with
his
brother
the
judge
to
see
what
could
be
done
with
it
it
was
a
land
speculation
as
usual
and
it
had
gotten
complicated
with
a
lawsuit
the
men
were
gone
seven
weeks
before
they
got
back
roxy
had
paid
her
visit
to
wilson
and
was
satisfied
wilson
took
the
labeled
them
with
the
names
and
with
the
date
october
the
first
put
them
carefully
away
and
continued
his
chat
with
roxy
who
seemed
very
anxious
that
he
should
admire
the
great
advance
in
flesh
and
beauty
which
the
babies
had
made
since
he
took
their
a
month
before
he
complimented
their
improvement
to
her
contentment
and
as
they
were
without
any
disguise
of
jam
or
other
stain
she
trembled
all
the
while
and
was
miserably
frightened
lest
at
any
moment
he
but
he
did
he
discovered
nothing
and
she
went
home
jubilant
and
dropped
all
concern
about
the
matter
permanently
out
of
her
mind
chapter
iv
the
ways
of
the
changelings
adam
and
eve
had
many
advantages
but
the
principal
one
was
that
they
escaped
wilson
calendar
there
is
this
trouble
about
special
providences
namely
there
is
so
often
a
doubt
as
to
which
party
was
intended
to
be
the
beneficiary
in
the
case
of
the
children
the
bears
and
the
prophet
the
bears
got
more
real
satisfaction
out
of
the
episode
than
the
prophet
did
because
they
got
the
wilson
calendar
this
history
must
henceforth
accommodate
itself
to
the
change
which
roxana
has
consummated
and
call
the
real
heir
chambers
and
the
usurping
little
slave
thomas
à
becket
shortening
this
latter
name
to
tom
for
daily
use
as
the
people
about
him
did
tom
was
a
bad
baby
from
the
very
beginning
of
his
usurpation
he
would
cry
for
nothing
he
would
burst
into
storms
of
devilish
temper
without
notice
and
let
go
scream
after
scream
and
squall
after
squall
then
climax
the
thing
with
holding
his
breath
that
frightful
specialty
of
the
teething
nursling
in
the
throes
of
which
the
creature
exhausts
its
lungs
then
is
convulsed
with
noiseless
squirmings
and
twistings
and
kickings
in
the
effort
to
get
its
breath
while
the
lips
turn
blue
and
the
mouth
stands
wide
and
rigid
offering
for
inspection
one
wee
tooth
set
in
the
lower
rim
of
a
hoop
of
red
gums
and
when
the
appalling
stillness
has
endured
until
one
is
sure
the
lost
breath
will
never
return
a
nurse
comes
flying
and
dashes
water
in
the
face
and
presto
the
lungs
fill
and
instantly
discharge
a
shriek
or
a
yell
or
a
howl
which
bursts
the
listening
ear
and
surprises
the
owner
of
it
into
saying
words
which
would
not
go
well
with
a
halo
if
he
had
one
the
baby
tom
would
claw
anybody
who
came
within
reach
of
his
nails
and
pound
anybody
he
could
reach
with
his
rattle
he
would
scream
for
water
until
he
got
it
and
then
throw
cup
and
all
on
the
floor
and
scream
for
more
he
was
indulged
in
all
his
caprices
howsoever
troublesome
and
exasperating
they
might
be
he
was
allowed
to
eat
anything
he
wanted
particularly
things
that
would
give
him
the
when
he
got
to
be
old
enough
to
begin
to
toddle
about
and
say
broken
words
and
get
an
idea
of
what
his
hands
were
for
he
was
a
more
consummate
pest
than
ever
roxy
got
no
rest
while
he
was
awake
he
would
call
for
anything
and
everything
he
saw
simply
saying
awnt
it
want
it
which
was
a
command
when
it
was
brought
he
said
in
a
frenzy
and
motioning
it
away
with
his
hands
do
awnt
it
do
awnt
it
and
the
moment
it
was
gone
he
set
up
frantic
yells
of
awnt
it
awnt
it
awnt
it
and
roxy
had
to
give
wings
to
her
heels
to
get
that
thing
back
to
him
again
before
he
could
get
time
to
carry
out
his
intention
of
going
into
convulsions
about
it
what
he
preferred
above
all
other
things
was
the
tongs
this
was
because
his
father
had
forbidden
him
to
have
them
lest
he
break
windows
and
furniture
with
them
the
moment
roxy
back
was
turned
he
would
toddle
to
the
presence
of
the
tongs
and
say
like
it
and
cock
his
eye
to
one
side
to
see
if
roxy
was
observing
then
awnt
it
and
cock
his
eye
again
then
hab
it
with
another
furtive
glance
and
finally
take
it
and
the
prize
was
his
the
next
moment
the
heavy
implement
was
raised
aloft
the
next
there
was
a
crash
and
a
squall
and
the
cat
was
off
on
three
legs
to
meet
an
engagement
roxy
would
arrive
just
as
the
lamp
or
a
window
went
to
irremediable
smash
tom
got
all
the
petting
chambers
got
none
tom
got
all
the
delicacies
chambers
got
mush
and
milk
and
clabber
without
sugar
in
consequence
tom
was
a
sickly
child
and
chambers
was
tom
was
fractious
as
roxy
called
it
and
overbearing
chambers
was
meek
and
docile
with
all
her
splendid
common
sense
and
practical
ability
roxy
was
a
doting
fool
of
a
mother
she
was
this
toward
her
child
and
she
was
also
more
than
this
by
the
fiction
created
by
herself
he
was
become
her
master
the
necessity
of
recognizing
this
relation
outwardly
and
of
perfecting
herself
in
the
forms
required
to
express
the
recognition
had
moved
her
to
such
diligence
and
faithfulness
in
practicing
these
forms
that
this
exercise
soon
concreted
itself
into
habit
it
became
automatic
and
unconscious
then
a
natural
result
followed
deceptions
intended
solely
for
others
gradually
grew
practically
into
as
well
the
mock
reverence
became
real
reverence
the
mock
obsequiousness
real
obsequiousness
the
mock
homage
real
homage
the
little
counterfeit
rift
of
separation
between
and
widened
and
widened
and
became
an
abyss
and
a
very
real
one
and
on
one
side
of
it
stood
roxy
the
dupe
of
her
own
deceptions
and
on
the
other
stood
her
child
no
longer
a
usurper
to
her
but
her
accepted
and
recognized
master
he
was
her
darling
her
master
and
her
deity
all
in
one
and
in
her
worship
of
him
she
forgot
who
she
was
and
what
he
had
been
in
babyhood
tom
cuffed
and
banged
and
scratched
chambers
unrebuked
and
chambers
early
learned
that
between
meekly
bearing
it
and
resenting
it
the
advantage
all
lay
with
the
former
policy
the
few
times
that
his
persecutions
had
moved
him
beyond
control
and
made
him
fight
back
had
cost
him
very
dear
at
headquarters
not
at
the
hands
of
roxy
for
if
she
ever
went
beyond
scolding
him
sharply
for
who
his
young
marster
was
she
at
least
never
extended
her
punishment
beyond
a
box
on
the
ear
no
percy
driscoll
was
the
person
he
told
chambers
that
under
no
provocation
whatever
was
he
privileged
to
lift
his
hand
against
his
little
master
chambers
overstepped
the
line
three
times
and
got
three
such
convincing
canings
from
the
man
who
was
his
father
and
did
know
it
that
he
took
tom
cruelties
in
all
humility
after
that
and
made
no
more
experiments
outside
of
the
house
the
two
boys
were
together
all
through
their
boyhood
chambers
was
strong
beyond
his
years
and
a
good
fighter
strong
because
he
was
coarsely
fed
and
hard
worked
about
the
house
and
a
good
fighter
because
tom
furnished
him
plenty
of
practice
on
white
boys
whom
he
hated
and
was
afraid
of
chambers
was
his
constant
to
and
from
school
he
was
present
on
the
playground
at
recess
to
protect
his
charge
he
fought
himself
into
such
a
formidable
reputation
by
and
by
that
tom
could
have
changed
clothes
with
him
and
ridden
in
peace
like
sir
kay
in
launcelot
armor
he
was
good
at
games
of
skill
too
tom
staked
him
with
marbles
to
play
keeps
with
and
then
took
all
the
winnings
away
from
him
in
the
winter
season
chambers
was
on
hand
in
tom
clothes
with
holy
red
mittens
and
holy
shoes
and
pants
holy
at
the
knees
and
seat
to
drag
a
sled
up
the
hill
for
tom
warmly
clad
to
ride
down
on
but
he
never
got
a
ride
himself
he
built
snow
men
and
snow
fortifications
under
tom
directions
he
was
tom
patient
target
when
tom
wanted
to
do
some
snowballing
but
the
target
could
fire
back
chambers
carried
tom
skates
to
the
river
and
strapped
them
on
him
then
trotted
around
after
him
on
the
ice
so
as
to
be
on
hand
when
wanted
but
he
was
ever
asked
to
try
the
skates
himself
in
summer
the
pet
pastime
of
the
boys
of
dawson
landing
was
to
steal
apples
peaches
and
melons
from
the
farmers
mainly
on
account
of
the
risk
they
ran
of
getting
their
heads
laid
open
with
the
butt
of
the
farmer
whip
tom
was
a
distinguished
adept
at
these
thefts
by
proxy
chambers
did
his
stealing
and
got
the
and
for
his
share
tom
always
made
chambers
go
in
swimming
with
him
and
stay
by
him
as
a
protection
when
tom
had
had
enough
he
would
slip
out
and
tie
knots
in
chambers
shirt
dip
the
knots
in
the
water
and
make
them
hard
to
undo
then
dress
himself
and
sit
by
and
laugh
while
the
naked
shiverer
tugged
at
the
stubborn
knots
with
his
teeth
tom
did
his
humble
comrade
these
various
ill
turns
partly
out
of
native
viciousness
and
partly
because
he
hated
him
for
his
superiorities
of
physique
and
pluck
and
for
his
manifold
cleverness
tom
could
dive
for
it
gave
him
splitting
headaches
chambers
could
dive
without
inconvenience
and
was
fond
of
doing
it
he
excited
so
much
admiration
one
day
among
a
crowd
of
white
boys
by
throwing
back
somersaults
from
the
stern
of
a
canoe
that
it
wearied
tom
spirit
and
at
last
he
shoved
the
canoe
underneath
chambers
while
he
was
in
the
air
so
he
came
down
on
his
head
in
the
and
while
he
lay
unconscious
several
of
tom
ancient
adversaries
saw
that
their
opportunity
was
come
and
they
gave
the
false
heir
such
a
drubbing
that
with
chambers
best
help
he
was
hardly
able
to
drag
himself
home
afterward
when
the
boys
were
fifteen
and
upward
tom
was
showing
off
in
the
river
one
day
when
he
was
taken
with
a
cramp
and
shouted
for
help
it
was
a
common
trick
with
the
boys
particularly
if
a
stranger
was
present
to
pretend
a
cramp
and
howl
for
help
then
when
the
stranger
came
tearing
hand
over
hand
to
the
rescue
the
howler
would
go
on
struggling
and
howling
till
he
was
close
at
hand
then
replace
the
howl
with
a
sarcastic
smile
and
swim
blandly
away
while
the
town
boys
assailed
the
dupe
with
a
volley
of
jeers
and
laughter
tom
had
never
tried
this
joke
as
yet
but
was
supposed
to
be
trying
it
now
so
the
boys
held
warily
back
but
chambers
believed
his
master
was
in
earnest
therefore
he
swam
out
and
arrived
in
time
unfortunately
and
saved
his
life
this
was
the
last
feather
tom
had
managed
to
endure
everything
else
but
to
have
to
remain
publicly
and
permanently
under
such
an
obligation
as
this
to
a
nigger
and
to
this
nigger
of
all
niggers
this
was
too
much
he
heaped
insults
upon
chambers
for
pretending
to
think
he
was
in
earnest
in
calling
for
help
and
said
that
anybody
but
a
nigger
would
have
known
he
was
funning
and
left
him
alone
tom
enemies
were
in
strong
force
here
so
they
came
out
with
their
opinions
quite
freely
they
laughed
at
him
and
called
him
coward
liar
sneak
and
other
sorts
of
pet
names
and
told
him
they
meant
to
call
chambers
by
a
new
name
after
this
and
make
it
common
in
the
town
tom
driscoll
niggerpappy
to
signify
that
he
had
had
a
second
birth
into
this
life
and
that
chambers
was
the
author
of
his
new
being
tom
grew
frantic
under
these
taunts
and
shouted
knock
their
heads
off
chambers
knock
their
heads
off
what
do
you
stand
there
with
your
hands
in
your
pockets
for
chambers
expostulated
and
said
but
marse
tom
dey
too
many
of
dey
do
you
hear
me
please
marse
tom
do
make
me
dey
so
many
of
dat
tom
sprang
at
him
and
drove
his
into
him
two
or
three
times
before
the
boys
could
snatch
him
away
and
give
the
wounded
lad
a
chance
to
escape
he
was
considerably
hurt
but
not
seriously
if
the
blade
had
been
a
little
longer
his
career
would
have
ended
there
tom
had
long
ago
taught
roxy
her
place
it
had
been
many
a
day
now
since
she
had
ventured
a
caress
or
a
fondling
epithet
in
his
quarter
such
things
from
a
nigger
were
repulsive
to
him
and
she
had
been
warned
to
keep
her
distance
and
remember
who
she
was
she
saw
her
darling
gradually
cease
from
being
her
son
she
saw
that
detail
perish
utterly
all
that
was
left
was
master
master
pure
and
simple
and
it
was
not
a
gentle
mastership
either
she
saw
herself
sink
from
the
sublime
height
of
motherhood
to
the
somber
depths
of
unmodified
slavery
the
abyss
of
separation
between
her
and
her
boy
was
complete
she
was
merely
his
chattel
now
his
convenience
his
dog
his
cringing
and
helpless
slave
the
humble
and
unresisting
victim
of
his
capricious
temper
and
vicious
nature
sometimes
she
could
not
go
to
sleep
even
when
worn
out
with
fatigue
because
her
rage
boiled
so
high
over
the
day
experiences
with
her
boy
she
would
mumble
and
mutter
to
herself
he

i

to

en
dis
is
what
i
git
for
it
sometimes
when
some
outrage
of
peculiar
offensiveness
stung
her
to
the
heart
she
would
plan
schemes
of
vengeance
and
revel
in
the
fancied
spectacle
of
his
exposure
to
the
world
as
an
imposter
and
a
slave
but
in
the
midst
of
these
joys
fear
would
strike
her
she
had
made
him
too
strong
she
could
prove
nothing
and
heavens
she
might
get
sold
down
the
river
for
her
pains
so
her
schemes
always
went
for
nothing
and
she
laid
them
aside
in
impotent
rage
against
the
fates
and
against
herself
for
playing
the
fool
on
that
fatal
september
day
in
not
providing
herself
with
a
witness
for
use
in
the
day
when
such
a
thing
might
be
needed
for
the
appeasing
of
her
heart
and
yet
the
moment
tom
happened
to
be
good
to
her
and
kind
and
this
occurred
every
now
and
then
all
her
sore
places
were
healed
and
she
was
happy
happy
and
proud
for
this
was
her
son
her
nigger
son
lording
it
among
the
whites
and
securely
avenging
their
crimes
against
her
race
there
were
two
grand
funerals
in
dawson
landing
that
fall
the
fall
of
one
was
that
of
colonel
cecil

the
other
that
of
percy

on
his

set
roxy
free
and
delivered
his
idolized
ostensible
son
solemnly
into
the
keeping
of

his
wife
those
childless

judge
driscoll
had
gone
privately
to
his
brother
a
month
before
and
bought
chambers
he
had
heard
that
tom
had
been
trying
to
get
his
father
to
sell
the
boy
down
the
river
and
he
wanted
to
prevent
the
scandal
for
public
sentiment
did
not
approve
of
that
way
of
treating
family
servants
for
light
cause
or
for
no
cause
percy
driscoll
had
worn
himself
out
in
trying
to
save
his
great
speculative
landed
estate
and
had
died
without
succeeding
he
was
hardly
in
his
grave
before
the
boom
collapsed
and
left
his
hitherto
envied
young
devil
of
an
heir
a
pauper
but
that
was
nothing
his
uncle
told
him
he
should
be
his
heir
and
have
all
his
fortune
when
he
died
so
tom
was
comforted
roxy
had
no
home
now
so
she
resolved
to
go
around
and
say
to
her
friends
and
then
clear
out
and
see
the
world
that
is
to
say
she
would
go
chambermaiding
on
a
steamboat
the
darling

of
her
race
and

her
last
call
was
on
the
black
giant
jasper
she
found
him
chopping
wilson
winter
provision
of
wood
wilson
was
chatting
with
him
when
roxy
arrived
he
asked
her
how
she
could
bear
to
go
off
chambermaiding
and
leave
her
boys
and
chaffingly
offered
to
copy
off
a
series
of
their
reaching
up
to
their
twelfth
year
for
her
to
remember
them
by
but
she
sobered
in
a
moment
wondering
if
he
suspected
anything
then
she
said
she
believed
she
did
want
them
wilson
said
to
himself
the

in

superstitious
she
thinks
there
some
devilry

about

enjoyed
two
years
of
bliss
with
that
prize

that
was
troubled
a
little
at
times
it
is
true
but
bliss
nevertheless
then
she
died
and
her
husband
and
his
childless
sister
pratt
continued
the
at
the
old
stand
tom
was
petted
and
indulged
and
spoiled
to
his
entire
content
or
nearly
that
this
went
on
till
he
was
nineteen
then
he
was
sent
to
yale
he
went
handsomely
equipped
with
conditions
but
otherwise
he
was
not
an
object
of
distinction
there
he
remained
at
yale
two
years
and
then
threw
up
the
struggle
he
came
home
with
his
manners
a
good
deal
improved
he
had
lost
his
surliness
and
brusqueness
and
was
rather
pleasantly
soft
and
smooth
now
he
was
furtively
and
sometimes
openly
ironical
of
speech
and
given
to
gently
touching
people
on
the
raw
but
he
did
it
with
a
semiconscious
air
that
carried
it
off
safely
and
kept
him
from
getting
into
trouble
he
was
as
indolent
as
ever
and
showed
no
very
strenuous
desire
to
hunt
up
an
occupation
people
argued
from
this
that
he
preferred
to
be
supported
by
his
uncle
until
his
uncle
shoes
should
become
vacant
he
brought
back
one
or
two
new
habits
with
him
one
of
which
he
rather
openly
practised
tippling
but
concealed
another
which
was
gambling
it
would
not
do
to
gamble
where
his
uncle
could
hear
of
it
he
knew
that
quite
well
tom
eastern
polish
was
not
popular
among
the
young
people
they
could
have
endured
it
perhaps
if
tom
had
stopped
there
but
he
wore
gloves
and
that
they
could
stand
and
would
so
he
was
mainly
without
society
he
brought
home
with
him
a
suit
of
clothes
of
such
exquisite
style
and
cut
and
fashion
eastern
fashion
city
fashion
that
it
filled
everybody
with
anguish
and
was
regarded
as
a
peculiarly
wanton
affront
he
enjoyed
the
feeling
which
he
was
exciting
and
paraded
the
town
serene
and
happy
all
day
but
the
young
fellows
set
a
tailor
to
work
that
night
and
when
tom
started
out
on
his
parade
next
morning
he
found
the
old
deformed
negro
straddling
along
in
his
wake
tricked
out
in
a
flamboyant
exaggeration
of
his
finery
and
imitating
his
fancy
eastern
graces
as
well
as
he
could
tom
surrendered
and
after
that
clothed
himself
in
the
local
fashion
but
the
dull
country
town
was
tiresome
to
him
since
his
acquaintanceship
with
livelier
regions
and
it
grew
daily
more
and
more
so
he
began
to
make
little
trips
to
louis
for
refreshment
there
he
found
companionship
to
suit
him
and
pleasures
to
his
taste
along
with
more
freedom
in
some
particulars
than
he
could
have
at
home
so
during
the
next
two
years
his
visits
to
the
city
grew
in
frequency
and
his
tarryings
there
grew
steadily
longer
in
duration
he
was
getting
into
deep
waters
he
was
taking
chances
privately
which
might
get
him
into
trouble
some
day
in
fact
did
judge
driscoll
had
retired
from
the
bench
and
from
all
business
activities
in
and
had
now
been
comfortably
idle
three
years
he
was
president
of
the
society
and
wilson
was
the
other
member
the
society
weekly
discussions
were
now
the
old
lawyer
main
interest
in
life
was
still
toiling
in
obscurity
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
under
the
blight
of
that
unlucky
remark
which
he
had
let
fall
years
before
about
the
dog
judge
driscoll
was
his
friend
and
claimed
that
he
had
a
mind
above
the
average
but
that
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
judge
whims
and
it
failed
to
modify
the
public
opinion
or
rather
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
failed
but
there
was
another
and
better
one
if
the
judge
had
stopped
with
bare
assertion
it
would
have
had
a
good
deal
of
effect
but
he
made
the
mistake
of
trying
to
prove
his
position
for
some
years
wilson
had
been
privately
at
work
on
a
whimsical
almanac
for
his
amusement
a
calendar
with
a
little
dab
of
ostensible
philosophy
usually
in
ironical
form
appended
to
each
date
and
the
judge
thought
that
these
quips
and
fancies
of
wilson
were
neatly
turned
and
cute
so
he
carried
a
handful
of
them
around
one
day
and
read
them
to
some
of
the
chief
citizens
but
irony
was
not
for
those
people
their
mental
vision
was
not
focussed
for
it
they
read
those
playful
trifles
in
the
solidest
earnest
and
decided
without
hesitancy
that
if
there
had
ever
been
any
doubt
that
dave
wilson
was
a
which
there
had
this
revelation
removed
that
doubt
for
good
and
all
that
is
just
the
way
in
this
world
an
enemy
can
partly
ruin
a
man
but
it
takes
a
injudicious
friend
to
complete
the
thing
and
make
it
perfect
after
this
the
judge
felt
tenderer
than
ever
toward
wilson
and
surer
than
ever
that
his
calendar
had
merit
judge
driscoll
could
be
a
and
still
hold
his
place
in
society
because
he
was
the
person
of
most
consequence
in
the
community
and
therefore
could
venture
to
go
his
own
way
and
follow
out
his
own
notions
the
other
member
of
his
pet
organization
was
allowed
the
like
liberty
because
he
was
a
cipher
in
the
estimation
of
the
public
and
nobody
attached
any
importance
to
what
he
thought
or
did
he
was
liked
he
was
welcome
enough
all
around
but
he
simply
did
count
for
anything
the
widow
cooper
affectionately
called
aunt
patsy
by
everybody
lived
in
a
snug
and
comely
cottage
with
her
daughter
rowena
who
was
nineteen
romantic
amiable
and
very
pretty
but
otherwise
of
no
consequence
rowena
had
a
couple
of
young
brothers
also
of
no
consequence
the
widow
had
a
large
spare
room
which
she
let
to
a
lodger
with
board
when
she
could
find
one
but
this
room
had
been
empty
for
a
year
now
to
her
sorrow
her
income
was
only
sufficient
for
the
family
support
and
she
needed
the
for
trifling
luxuries
but
now
at
last
on
a
flaming
june
day
she
found
herself
happy
her
tedious
wait
was
ended
her
advertisement
had
been
answered
and
not
by
a
village
applicant
oh
no
this
letter
was
from
away
off
yonder
in
the
dim
great
world
to
the
north
it
was
from
louis
she
sat
on
her
porch
gazing
out
with
unseeing
eyes
upon
the
shining
reaches
of
the
mighty
mississippi
her
thoughts
steeped
in
her
good
fortune
indeed
it
was
specially
good
fortune
for
she
was
to
have
two
lodgers
instead
of
one
she
had
read
the
letter
to
the
family
and
rowena
had
danced
away
to
see
to
the
cleaning
and
airing
of
the
room
by
the
slave
woman
nancy
and
the
boys
had
rushed
abroad
in
the
town
to
spread
the
great
news
for
it
was
matter
of
public
interest
and
the
public
would
wonder
and
not
be
pleased
if
not
informed
presently
rowena
returned
all
ablush
with
joyous

and
open

judge
was
full
of
congratulations
and
curiosity
the
letter
was
read
and
discussed
soon
justice
robinson
arrived
with
more
congratulations
and
there
was
a
new
reading
and
a
new
discussion
this
was
the
beginning
neighbor
after
neighbor
of
both
sexes
followed
and
the
procession
drifted
in
and
out
all
day
and
evening
and
all
wednesday
and
thursday
the
letter
was
read
and
until
it
was
nearly
worn
out
everybody
admired
its
courtly
and
gracious
tone
and
smooth
and
practised
style
everybody
was
sympathetic
and
excited
and
the
coopers
were
steeped
in
happiness
all
the
while
the
boats
were
very
uncertain
in
low
water
in
these
primitive
times
this
time
the
thursday
boat
had
not
arrived
at
ten
at
night
so
the
people
had
waited
at
the
landing
all
day
for
nothing
they
were
driven
to
their
homes
by
a
heavy
storm
without
having
had
a
view
of
the
illustrious
foreigners
eleven
came
and
the
cooper
house
was
the
only
one
in
the
town
that
still
had
lights
burning
the
rain
and
thunder
were
booming
yet
and
the
anxious
family
were
still
waiting
still
hoping
at
last
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
the
family
jumped
to
open
it
two
negro
men
entered
each
carrying
a
trunk
and
proceeded
toward
the
then
entered
the
twins
the
handsomest
the
best
dressed
the
most
pair
of
young
fellows
the
west
had
ever
seen
one
was
a
little
fairer
than
the
other
but
otherwise
they
were
exact
duplicates

us

coaxed
a
step
at
a
wilson

at
breakfast
in
the
morning
the
twins
charm
of

and
easy
and
polished

made
speedy
conquest
of
the

good

all
constraint
and

quickly
disappeared
and
the
friendliest
feeling
succeeded
aunt
patsy
called
them
by
their
christian
names
almost
from
the
beginning
she
was
full
of
the
keenest
curiosity
about
them
and
showed
it
they
responded
by
talking
about
themselves
which
pleased
her
greatly
it
presently
appeared
that
in
their
early
youth
they
had
known
poverty
and
hardship
as
the
talk
wandered
along
the
old
lady
watched
for
the
right
place
to
drop
in
a
question
or
two
concerning
that
matter
and
when
she
found
it
she
said
to
the
blond
twin
who
was
now
doing
the
biographies
in
his
turn
while
the
brunette
one
rested
if
it
ai
asking
what
i
ought
not
to
ask
angelo
how
did
you
come
to
be
so
friendless
and
in
such
trouble
when
you
were
little
do
you
mind
telling
but
do
if
you
do
oh
we
do
mind
it
at
all
madam
in
our
case
it
was
merely
misfortune
and
nobody
fault
our
parents
were
well
to
do
there
in
italy
and
we
were
their
only
child
we
were
of
the
old
florentine
nobility
rowena
heart
gave
a
great
bound
her
nostrils
expanded
and
a
fine
light
played
in
her
eyes
and
when
the
war
broke
out
my
father
was
on
the
losing
side
and
had
to
fly
for
his
life
his
estates
were
confiscated
his
personal
property
seized
and
there
we
were
in
germany
strangers
friendless
and
in
fact
paupers
my
brother
and
i
were
ten
years
old
and
well
educated
for
that
age
very
studious
very
fond
of
our
books
and
well
grounded
in
the
german
french
spanish
and
english
languages
also
we
were
marvelous
musical
prodigies
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
it
it
being
only
the
truth
our
father
survived
his
misfortunes
only
a
month
our
mother
soon
followed
him
and
we
were
alone
in
the
world
our
parents
could
have
made
themselves
comfortable
by
exhibiting
us
as
a
show
and
they
had
many
and
large
offers
but
the
thought
revolted
their
pride
and
they
said
they
would
starve
and
die
first
but
what
they
would
consent
to
do
we
had
to
do
without
the
formality
of
consent
we
were
seized
for
the
debts
occasioned
by
their
illness
and
their
funerals
and
placed
among
the
attractions
of
a
cheap
museum
in
berlin
to
earn
the
liquidation
money
it
took
us
two
years
to
get
out
of
that
slavery
we
traveled
all
about
germany
receiving
no
wages
and
not
even
our
keep
we
had
to
be
exhibited
for
nothing
and
beg
our
bread
well
madam
the
rest
is
not
of
much
consequence
when
we
escaped
from
that
slavery
at
twelve
years
of
age
we
were
in
some
respects
men
experience
had
taught
us
some
valuable
things
among
others
how
to
take
care
of
ourselves
how
to
avoid
and
defeat
sharks
and
sharpers
and
how
to
conduct
our
own
business
for
our
own
profit
and
without
other
people
help
we
traveled
everywhere
years
and
years
picking
up
smatterings
of
strange
tongues
familiarizing
ourselves
with
strange
sights
and
strange
customs
accumulating
an
education
of
a
wide
and
varied
and
curious
sort
it
was
a
pleasant
life
we
went
to
venice
to
london
paris
russia
india
china
japan
at
this
point
nancy
the
slave
woman
thrust
her
head
in
at
the
door
and
exclaimed
ole
missus
de
house
is
plum
jam
full
o
people
en
dey
jes
to
see
de
she
indicated
the
twins
with
a
nod
of
her
head
and
tucked
it
back
out
of
sight
again
it
was
a
proud
occasion
for
the
widow
and
she
promised
herself
high
satisfaction
in
showing
off
her
fine
foreign
birds
before
her
neighbors
and
friends
simple
folk
who
had
hardly
ever
seen
a
foreigner
of
any
kind
and
never
one
of
any
distinction
or
style
yet
her
feeling
was
moderate
indeed
when
contrasted
with
rowena
rowena
was
in
the
clouds
she
walked
on
air
this
was
to
be
the
greatest
day
the
most
romantic
episode
in
the
colorless
history
of
that
dull
country
town
she
was
to
be
familiarly
near
the
source
of
its
glory
and
feel
the
full
flood
of
it
pour
over
her
and
about
her
the
other
girls
could
only
gaze
and
envy
not
partake
the
widow
was
ready
rowena
was
ready
so
also
were
the
foreigners
the
party
moved
along
the
hall
the
twins
in
advance
and
entered
the
open
parlor
door
whence
issued
a
low
hum
of
conversation
the
twins
took
a
position
near
the
door
the
widow
stood
at
luigi
side
rowena
stood
beside
angelo
and
the
and
the
introductions
began
the
widow
was
all
smiles
and
contentment
she
received
the
procession
and
passed
it
on
to
rowena

on
none
of
these
visitors
was
at
ease
but
being
honest
people
they
did
pretend
to
be
none
of
them
had
ever
seen
a
person
bearing
a
title
of
nobility
before
and
none
had
been
expecting
to
see
one
now
consequently
the
title
came
upon
them
as
a
kind
of
surprise
and
caught
them
unprepared
a
few
tried
to
rise
to
the
emergency
and
got
out
an
awkward
my
lord
or
your
lordship
or
something
of
that
sort
but
the
great
majority
were
overwhelmed
by
the
unaccustomed
word
and
its
dim
and
awful
associations
with
gilded
courts
and
stately
ceremony
and
anointed
kingship
so
they
only
fumbled
through
the
and
passed
on
speechless
now
and
then
as
happens
at
all
receptions
everywhere
a
more
than
ordinary
friendly
soul
blocked
the
procession
and
kept
it
waiting
while
he
inquired
how
the
brothers
liked
the
village
and
how
long
they
were
going
to
stay
and
if
their
families
were
well
and
dragged
in
the
weather
and
hoped
it
would
get
cooler
soon
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
so
as
to
be
able
to
say
when
they
got
home
i
had
quite
a
long
talk
with
them
but
nobody
did
or
said
anything
of
a
regrettable
kind
and
so
the
great
affair
went
through
to
the
end
in
a
creditable
and
satisfactory
fashion
general
conversation
followed
and
the
twins
drifted
about
from
group
to
group
talking
easily
and
fluently
and
winning
approval
compelling
admiration
and
achieving
favor
from
all
the
widow
followed
their
conquering
march
with
a
proud
eye
and
every
now
and
then
rowena
said
to
herself
with
deep
satisfaction
and
to
think
they
are
ours
all
ours
there
were
no
idle
moments
for
mother
or
daughter
eager
inquiries
concerning
the
twins
were
pouring
into
their
enchanted
ears
all
the
time
each
was
the
constant
center
of
a
group
of
breathless
listeners
each
recognized
that
she
knew
now
for
the
first
time
the
real
meaning
of
that
great
word
glory
and
perceived
the
stupendous
value
of
it
and
understood
why
men
in
all
ages
had
been
willing
to
throw
away
meaner
happinesses
treasure
life
itself
to
get
a
taste
of
its
sublime
and
supreme
joy
napoleon
and
all
his
kind
stood
accounted
for
and
justified
when
rowena
had
at
last
done
all
her
duty
by
the
people
in
the
parlor
she
went
to
satisfy
the
longings
of
an
there
for
the
parlor
was
not
big
enough
to
hold
all
the
comers
again
she
was
besieged
by
eager
questioners
and
again
she
swam
in
sunset
seas
of
glory
when
the
forenoon
was
nearly
gone
she
recognized
with
a
pang
that
this
most
splendid
episode
of
her
life
was
almost
over
that
nothing
could
prolong
it
that
nothing
quite
its
equal
could
ever
fall
to
her
fortune
again
but
never
mind
it
was
sufficient
unto
itself
the
grand
occasion
had
moved
on
an
ascending
scale
from
the
start
and
was
a
noble
and
memorable
success
if
the
twins
could
but
do
some
crowning
act
now
to
climax
it
something
unusual
something
startling
something
to
concentrate
upon
themselves
the
company
loftiest
admiration
something
in
the
nature
of
an
electric
surprise
here
a
prodigious
broke
out
below
and
everybody
rushed
down
to
see
it
was
the
twins
knocking
out
a
classic
piece
on
the
piano
in
great
style
rowena
was
satisfied
satisfied
down
to
the
bottom
of
her
heart
the
young
strangers
were
kept
long
at
the
piano
the
villagers
were
astonished
and
enchanted
with
the
magnificence
of
their
performance
and
could
not
bear
to
have
them
stop
all
the
music
that
they
had
ever
heard
before
seemed
spiritless
and
barren
of
grace
or
charm
when
compared
with
these
intoxicating
floods
of
melodious
sound
they
realized
that
for
once
in
their
lives
they
were
hearing
masters
chapter
vii
the
unknown

one
of
the
most
striking
differences
between
a
cat
and
a
lie
is
that

wilson
calendar
the
company
broke
up
reluctantly
and
drifted
toward
their
several
homes
chatting
with
vivacity
and
all
agreeing
that
it
would
be
many
a
long
day
before
dawson
landing
would
see
the
equal
of
this
one
again
the
twins
had
accepted
several
invitations
while
the
reception
was
in
progress
and
had
also
volunteered
to
play
some
duets
at
an
amateur
entertainment
for
the
benefit
of
a
local
charity
society
was
eager
to
receive
them
to
its
bosom
judge
driscoll
had
the
good
fortune
to
secure
them
for
an
immediate
drive
and
to
be
the
first
to
display
them
in
public
they
entered
his
buggy
with
him
and
were
paraded
down
the
main
street
everybody
flocking
to
the
windows
and
sidewalks
to
see
the
judge
showed
the
strangers
the
new
graveyard
and
the
jail
and
where
the
richest
man
lived
and
the
freemasons
hall
and
the
methodist
church
and
the
presbyterian
church
and
where
the
baptist
church
was
going
to
be
when
they
got
some
money
to
build
it
with
and
showed
them
the
town
hall
and
the
and
got
out
the
independent
fire
company
in
uniform
and
had
them
put
out
an
imaginary
fire
then
he
let
them
inspect
the
muskets
of
the
militia
company
and
poured
out
an
exhaustless
stream
of
enthusiasm
over
all
these
splendors
and
seemed
very
well
satisfied
with
the
responses
he
got
for
the
twins
admired
his
admiration
and
paid
him
back
the
best
they
could
though
they
could
have
done
better
if
some
fifteen
or
sixteen
hundred
thousand
previous
experiences
of
this
sort
in
various
countries
had
not
already
rubbed
off
a
considerable
part
of
the
novelty
of
it
the
judge
laid
himself
out
hospitably
to
make
them
have
a
good
time
and
if
there
was
a
defect
anywhere
it
was
not
his
fault
he
told
them
a
good
many
humorous
anecdotes
and
always
forgot
the
nub
but
they
were
always
able
to
furnish
it
for
these
yarns
were
of
a
pretty
early
vintage
and
they
had
had
many
a
rejuvenating
pull
at
them
before
and
he
told
them
all
about
his
several
dignities
and
how
he
had
held
this
and
that
and
the
other
place
of
honor
or
profit
and
had
once
been
to
the
legislature
and
was
now
president
of
the
society
of
he
said
the
society
had
been
in
existence
four
years
and
already
had
two
members
and
was
firmly
established
he
would
call
for
the
brothers
in
the
evening
if
they
would
like
to
attend
a
meeting
of
it
accordingly
he
called
for
them
and
on
the
way
he
told
them
all
about
wilson
in
order
that
they
might
get
a
favorable
impression
of
him
in
advance
and
be
prepared
to
like
him
this
scheme
succeeded
the
favorable
impression
was
achieved
later
it
was
confirmed
and
solidified
when
wilson
proposed
that
out
of
courtesy
to
the
strangers
the
usual
topics
be
put
aside
and
the
hour
be
devoted
to
conversation
upon
ordinary
subjects
and
the
cultivation
of
friendly
relations
and
a
proposition
which
was
put
to
vote
and
carried
the
hour
passed
quickly
away
in
lively
talk
and
when
it
was
ended
the
lonesome
and
neglected
wilson
was
richer
by
two
friends
than
he
had
been
when
it
began
he
invited
the
twins
to
look
in
at
his
lodgings
presently
after
disposing
of
an
intervening
engagement
and
they
accepted
with
pleasure
toward
the
middle
of
the
evening
they
found
themselves
on
the
road
to
his
house
was
at
home
waiting
for
them
and
putting
in
his
time
puzzling
over
a
thing
which
had
come
under
his
notice
that
morning
the
matter
was
this
he
happened
to
be
up
very
early
at
dawn
in
fact
and
he
crossed
the
hall
which
divided
his
cottage
through
the
center
and
entered
a
room
to
get
something
there
the
window
of
the
room
had
no
curtains
for
that
side
of
the
house
had
long
been
unoccupied
and
through
this
window
he
caught
sight
of
something
which
surprised
and
interested
him
it
was
a
young
woman
a
young
woman
where
properly
no
young
woman
belonged
for
she
was
in
judge
driscoll
house
and
in
the
bedroom
over
the
judge
private
study
or
this
was
young
tom
driscoll
bedroom
he
and
the
judge
the
judge
widowed
sister
pratt
and
three
negro
servants
were
the
only
people
who
belonged
in
the
house
who
then
might
this
young
lady
be
the
two
houses
were
separated
by
an
ordinary
yard
with
a
low
fence
running
back
through
its
middle
from
the
street
in
front
to
the
lane
in
the
rear
the
distance
was
not
great
and
wilson
was
able
to
see
the
girl
very
well
the
of
the
room
she
was
in
being
up
and
the
window
also
the
girl
had
on
a
neat
and
trim
summer
dress
patterned
in
broad
stripes
of
pink
and
white
and
her
bonnet
was
equipped
with
a
pink
veil
she
was
practising
steps
gaits
and
attitudes
apparently
she
was
doing
the
thing
gracefully
and
was
very
much
absorbed
in
her
work
who
could
she
be
and
how
came
she
to
be
in
young
tom
driscoll
room
wilson
had
quickly
chosen
a
position
from
which
he
could
watch
the
girl
without
running
much
risk
of
being
seen
by
her
and
he
remained
there
hoping
she
would
raise
her
veil
and
betray
her
face
but
she
disappointed
him
after
a
matter
of
twenty
minutes
she
disappeared
and
although
he
stayed
at
his
post
half
an
hour
longer
she
came
no
more
toward
noon
he
dropped
in
at
the
judge
and
talked
with
pratt
about
the
great
event
of
the
day
the
levee
of
the
distinguished
foreigners
at
aunt
patsy
cooper
he
asked
after
her
nephew
tom
and
she
said
he
was
on
his
way
home
and
that
she
was
expecting
him
to
arrive
a
little
before
night
and
added
that
she
and
the
judge
were
gratified
to
gather
from
his
letters
that
he
was
conducting
himself
very
nicely
and
creditably
at
which
wilson
winked
to
himself
privately
wilson
did
not
ask
if
there
was
a
newcomer
in
the
house
but
he
asked
questions
that
would
have
brought
answers
as
to
that
matter
if
pratt
had
had
any
light
to
throw
so
he
went
away
satisfied
that
he
knew
of
things
that
were
going
on
in
her
house
of
which
she
herself
was
not
aware
he
was
now
waiting
for
the
twins
and
still
puzzling
over
the
problem
of
who
that
girl
might
be
and
how
she
happened
to
be
in
that
young
fellow
room

daybreak

so
sweet
and
steady
and

and
enduring

than
an
old
bird
of
wilson
calendar
it
is
necessary
now
to
hunt
up
roxy
at
the
time
she
was
set
free
and
went
away
chambermaiding
she
was
she
got
a
berth
as
second
chambermaid
on
a
cincinnati
boat
in
the
new
orleans
trade
the
grand
mogul
a
couple
of
trips
made
her
wonted
and
at
the
work
and
infatuated
her
with
the
stir
and
adventure
and
independence
of
steamboat
life
then
she
was
promoted
and
became
head
chambermaid
she
was
a
favorite
with
the
officers
and
exceedingly
proud
of
their
joking
and
friendly
way
with
her
during
eight
years
she
served
three
parts
of
the
year
on
that
boat
and
the
winters
on
a
vicksburg
packet
but
now
for
two
months
she
had
had
rheumatism
in
her
arms
and
was
obliged
to
let
the
alone
so
she
resigned
but
she
was
well
fixed
rich
as
she
would
have
described
it
for
she
had
lived
a
steady
life
and
had
banked
four
dollars
every
month
in
new
orleans
as
a
provision
for
her
old
age
she
said
in
the
start
that
she
had
put
shoes
on
one
nigger
to
tromple
on
her
with
and
that
one
mistake
like
that
was
enough
she
would
be
independent
of
the
human
race
thenceforth
forevermore
if
hard
work
and
economy
could
accomplish
it
when
the
boat
touched
the
levee
at
new
orleans
she
bade
to
her
comrades
on
the
grand
mogul
and
moved
her
kit
ashore
but
she
was
back
in
a
hour
the
bank
had
gone
to
smash
and
carried
her
four
hundred
dollars
with
it
she
was
a
pauper
and
homeless
also
disabled
bodily
at
least
for
the
present
the
officers
were
full
of
sympathy
for
her
in
her
trouble
and
made
up
a
little
purse
for
her
she
resolved
to
go
to
her
birthplace
she
had
friends
there
among
the
negroes
and
the
unfortunate
always
help
the
unfortunate
she
was
well
aware
of
that
those
lowly
comrades
of
her
youth
would
not
let
her
starve
she
took
the
little
local
packet
at
cairo
and
now
she
was
on
the
time
had
worn
away
her
bitterness
against
her
son
and
she
was
able
to
think
of
him
with
serenity
she
put
the
vile
side
of
him
out
of
her
mind
and
dwelt
only
on
recollections
of
his
occasional
acts
of
kindness
to
her
she
gilded
and
otherwise
decorated
these
and
made
them
very
pleasant
to
contemplate
she
began
to
long
to
see
him
she
would
go
and
fawn
upon
him
for
this
would
have
to
be
her
attitude
of
course
and
maybe
she
would
find
that
time
had
modified
him
and
that
he
would
be
glad
to
see
his
old
nurse
and
treat
her
gently
that
would
be
lovely
that
would
make
her
forget
her
woes
and
her
poverty
her
poverty
that
thought
inspired
her
to
add
another
castle
to
her
dream
maybe
he
would
give
her
a
trifle
now
and
then
maybe
a
dollar
once
a
month
say
any
little
thing
like
that
would
help
oh
ever
so
much
by
the
time
she
reached
dawson
landing
she
was
her
old
self
again
her
blues
were
gone
she
was
in
high
feather
she
would
get
along
surely
there
were
many
kitchens
where
the
servants
would
share
their
meals
with
her
and
also
steal
sugar
and
apples
and
other
dainties
for
her
to
carry
home
or
give
her
a
chance
to
pilfer
them
herself
which
would
answer
just
as
well
and
there
was
the
church
she
was
a
more
rabid
and
devoted
methodist
than
ever
and
her
piety
was
no
sham
but
was
strong
and
sincere
yes
with
plenty
of
creature
comforts
and
her
old
place
in
the
in
her
possession
again
she
would
be
perfectly
happy
and
at
peace
thenceforward
to
the
end
she
went
to
judge
driscoll
kitchen
first
of
all
she
was
received
there
in
great
form
and
with
vast
enthusiasm
her
wonderful
travels
and
the
strange
countries
she
had
seen
and
the
adventures
she
had
had
made
her
a
marvel
and
a
heroine
of
romance
the
negroes
hung
enchanted
upon
the
great
story
of
her
experiences
interrupting
her
all
along
with
eager
questions
with
laughter
exclamations
of
delight
and
expressions
of
applause
and
she
was
obliged
to
confess
to
herself
that
if
there
was
anything
better
in
this
world
than
steamboating
it
was
the
glory
to
be
got
by
telling
about
it
the
audience
loaded
her
stomach
with
their
dinners
and
then
stole
the
pantry
bare
to
load
up
her
basket
tom

yes
she
was
satisfied
now
and
quite
happy
and
sentimental
over
it
she
kept
coming
daily
and
at
last
she
was
told
that
tom
had
come
home
she
began
to
tremble
with
emotion
and
straightway
sent
to
beg
him
to
let
his
po
ole
nigger
mammy
have
jes
one
sight
of
him
en
die
for
joy
tom
was
stretched
at
his
lazy
ease
on
a
sofa
when
chambers
brought
the
petition
time
had
not
modified
his
ancient
detestation
of
the
humble
drudge
and
protector
of
his
boyhood
it
was
still
bitter
and
uncompromising
he
sat
up
and
bent
a
severe
gaze
upon
the
fair
face
of
the
young
fellow
whose
name
he
was
unconsciously
using
and
whose
family
rights
he
was
enjoying
he
maintained
the
gaze
until
the
victim
of
it
had
become
satisfactorily
pallid
with
terror
then
he
said
what
does
the
old
rip
want
with
me
the
petition
was
meekly
repeated
who
gave
you
permission
to
come
and
disturb
me
with
the
social
attentions
of
niggers
tom
had
risen
the
other
young
man
was
trembling
now
visibly
he
saw
what
was
coming
and
bent
his
head
sideways
and
put
up
his
left
arm
to
shield
it
tom
rained
cuffs
upon
the
head
and
its
shield
saying
no
word
the
victim
received
each
blow
with
a
beseeching
please
marse
tom
oh
please
marse
tom
seven
blows
then
tom
said
face
the
door
march
he
followed
behind
with
one
two
three
solid
kicks
the
last
one
helped
the
slave
over
the
and
he
limped
away
mopping
his
eyes
with
his
old
ragged
sleeve
tom
shouted
after
him
send
her
in
then
he
flung
himself
panting
on
the
sofa
again
and
rasped
out
the
remark
he
arrived
just
at
the
right
moment
i
was
full
to
the
brim
with
bitter
thinkings
and
nobody
to
take
it
out
of
how
refreshing
it
was
i
feel
better
tom
mother
entered
now
closing
the
door
behind
her
and
approached
her
son
with
all
the
wheedling
and
supplicating
servilities
that
fear
and
interest
can
impart
to
the
words
and
attitudes
of
the
born
slave
she
stopped
a
yard
from
her
boy
and
made
two
or
three
admiring
exclamations
over
his
manly
stature
and
general
handsomeness
and
tom
put
an
arm
under
his
head
and
hoisted
a
leg
over
the
in
order
to
look
properly
indifferent
my
lan

i

get
along
what
do
you
want
this
was
a
bitter
disappointment
roxy
had
for
so
many
days
nourished
and
fondled
and
petted
her
notion
that
tom
would
be
glad
to
see
his
old
nurse
and
would
make
her
proud
and
happy
to
the
marrow
with
a
cordial
word
or
two
that
it
took
two
rebuffs
to
convince
her
that
he
was
not
funning
and
that
her
beautiful
dream
was
a
fond
and
foolish
vanity
a
shabby
and
pitiful
mistake
she
was
hurt
to
the
heart
and
so
ashamed
that
for
a
moment
she
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
or
how
to
act
then
her
breast
began
to
heave
the
tears
came
and
in
her
forlornness
she
was
moved
to
try
that
other
dream
of
hers
an
appeal
to
her
charity
and
so
upon
the
impulse
and
without
reflection
she
offered
her
supplication
oh
marse
tom
de
po
ole

luck

and

about

roxy
backed
slowly
toward
the
door
when
she
was
she
stopped
and
said
mournfully

tom
relished
this
tune
less
than
any
that
had
preceded
it
for
it
began
to
wake
up
a
sort
of
echo
in
his
conscience
so
he
interrupted
and
said
with
decision
though
without
asperity
that
he
was
not
in
a
situation
to
help
her
and
was
going
to
do
it
ai
you
ever
gwine
to
me
marse
tom
no
now
go

and
do
bother

any
more
roxy
head
was
down
in
an
attitude
of
humility
but
now
the
fires
of
her
old
wrongs
flamed
up
in
her
breast
and
began
to
burn
fiercely
she
raised
her
head
slowly
till
it
was
well
up
and
at
the
same
time
her
great
frame
unconsciously
assumed
an
erect
and
masterful
attitude
with
all
the
majesty
and
grace
of
her
vanished
youth
in
it
she
raised
her
finger
and
punctuated
with
it
you
has
said
de
word
you
has
had
yo
chance
en
you
has
trompled
it
under
yo
foot
when
you
git
another
one
you
git
down
on
yo
knees
en
beg
for
it
a
cold
chill
went
to
tom
heart
he
did
know
why
for
he
did
not
reflect
that
such
words
from
such
an
incongruous
source
and
so
solemnly
delivered
could
not
easily
fail
of
that
effect
however
he
did
the
natural
thing
he
replied
with
bluster
and
mockery
you
give
me
a
chance
you
perhaps
i
better
get
down
on
my
knees
now
but
in
case
i
do
just
for
argument
sake
what
going
to
happen
pray
dis
is
what
is
gwine
to
happen
i
gwine
as
straight
to
yo
uncle
as
i
kin
walk
en
tell
him
every
las
thing
i
knows
you
tom
cheek
blenched
and
she
saw
it
disturbing
thoughts
began
to
chase
each
other
through
his
head
how
can
she
know
and
yet
she
must
have
found
out
she
looks
it
i
had
the
will
back
only
three
months
and
am
already
deep
in
debt
again
and
moving
heaven
and
earth
to
save
myself
from
exposure
and
destruction
with
a
reasonably
fair
show
of
getting
the
thing
covered
up
if
i
let
alone
and
now
this
fiend
has
gone
and
found
me
out
somehow
or
other
i
wonder
how
much
she
knows
oh
oh
oh
it
enough
to
break
a
body
heart
but
i
got
to
humor
her
there
no
other
way
then
he
worked
up
a
rather
sickly
sample
of
a
gay
laugh
and
a
hollow
chipperness
of
manner
and
said
well
well
roxy
dear
old
friends
like
you
and
me
must
quarrel
here
your
dollar
now
tell
me
what
you
know
he
held
out
the
bill
she
stood
as
she
was
and
made
no
movement
it
was
her
turn
to
scorn
persuasive
foolery
now
and
she
did
not
waste
it
she
said
with
a
grim
implacability
in
voice
and
manner
which
made
tom
almost
realize
that
even
a
former
slave
can
remember
for
ten
minutes
insults
and
injuries
returned
for
compliments
and
flatteries
received
and
can
also
enjoy
taking
revenge
for
them
when
the
opportunity
offers
what
does
i
know
i
tell
you
what
i
knows
i
knows
enough
to

he
said

laughed
a
mocking
laugh
and
said
scoffingly
with
a
toss
of
her
head
and
her
hands
on
her
hips

disdainfully
and
started
away
tom

panic

implored

to

draughts
of
satisfaction

again

he
ran
to
his
room
overhead
and
brought
down
a
bottle
which
was
full
she
tilted
it
up
and
took
a
drink
her
eyes
sparkled
with
satisfaction
and
she
tucked
the
bottle
under
her
shawl
saying
it
prime
i
take
it
along
tom
humbly
held
the
door
for
her
and
she
marched
out
as
grim
and
erect
as
a
grenadier
chapter
ix
tom
practises
sycophancy
why
is
it
that
we
rejoice
at
a
birth
and
grieve
at
a
funeral
it
is
because
we
are
not
the
person
wilson
calendar
it
is
easy
to
find
fault
if
one
has
that
disposition
there
was
once
a
man
who
not
being
able
to
find
any
other
fault
with
his
coal
complained
that
there
were
too
many
prehistoric
toads
in
wilson
calendar
tom
flung
himself
on
the
sofa
and
put
his
throbbing
head
in
his
hands
and
rested
his
elbows
on
his
knees
he
rocked
himself
back
and
forth
and
moaned
i
knelt
to
a
nigger
wench
he
muttered
i
thought
i
had
struck
the
deepest
depths
of
degradation
before
but
oh
dear
it
was
nothing
to
this
well
there
is
one
consolation
such
as
it
is
i
struck
bottom
this
time
there
nothing
lower
but
that
was
a
hasty
conclusion
at
ten
that
night
he
climbed
the
ladder
in
the
haunted
house
pale
weak
and
wretched
roxy
was
standing
in
the
door
of
one
of
the
rooms
waiting
for
she
had
heard
him
this
was
a
log
house
which
had
acquired
the
reputation
a
few
years
before
of
being
haunted
and
that
was
the
end
of
its
usefulness
nobody
would
live
in
it
afterward
or
go
near
it
by
night
and
most
people
even
gave
it
a
wide
berth
in
the
daytime
as
it
had
no
competition
it
was
called
the
haunted
house
it
was
getting
crazy
and
ruinous
now
from
long
neglect
it
stood
three
hundred
yards
beyond
wilson
house
with
nothing
between
but
vacancy
it
was
the
last
house
in
the
town
at
that
end
tom
followed
roxy
into
the
room
she
had
a
pile
of
clean
straw
in
the
corner
for
a
bed
some
cheap
but
clothing
was
hanging
on
the
wall
there
was
a
tin
lantern
freckling
the
floor
with
little
spots
of
light
and
there
were
various
boxes
scattered
about
which
served
for
chairs
the
two
sat
down
roxy

in

whirlwind
of

sensations
and

and

conviction
the

more
than

i

it
roxy
knew
her
conquest
was
complete
she
could
have
proved
nothing
to
anybody
and
her
threat
about
the
writings
was
a
lie
but
she
knew
the
person
she
was
dealing
with
and
had
made
both
statements
without
any
doubt
as
to
the
effect
they
would
produce
she
went
and
sat
down
on
her
and
the
pride
and
pomp
of
her
victorious
attitude
made
it
a
throne
she
said
now

had
only
six

he
gave
her
that
and
promised
to
start
fair
on
next
month
pension
chambers
how
much
is
you
in
debt
tom
shuddered
and
said
nearly
three
hundred
dollars
how
is
you
gwine
to
pay
it
tom
groaned
out
oh
i
do
know
do
ask
me
such
awful
questions
but
she
stuck
to
her
point
until
she
wearied
a
confession
out
of
him
he
had
been
prowling
about
in
disguise
stealing
small
valuables
from
private
houses
in
fact
he
made
a
good
deal
of
a
raid
on
his
a
fortnight
before
when
he
was
supposed
to
be
in
louis
but
he
doubted
if
he
had
sent
away
enough
stuff
to
realize
the
required
amount
and
was
afraid
to
make
a
further
venture
in
the
present
excited
state
of
the
town
his
mother
approved
of
his
conduct
and
offered
to
help
but
this
frightened
him
he
tremblingly
ventured
to
say
that
if
she
would
retire
from
the
town
he
should
feel
better
and
safer
and
could
hold
his
head
higher
and
was
going
on
to
make
an
argument
but
she
interrupted
and
surprised
him
pleasantly
by
saying
she
was
ready
it
did
make
any
difference
to
her
where
she
stayed
so
that
she
got
her
share
of
the
pension
regularly
she
said
she
would
not
go
far
and
would
call
at
the
haunted
house
once
a
month
for
her
money
then
she
said
i
do
hate
you
so
much
now
but
i
hated
you
a
many
a
year

of

when
angry
count
four
when
very
angry
calendar
every
now
and
then
after
tom
went
to
bed
he
had
sudden
wakings
out
of
his
sleep
and
his
first
thought
was
oh
joy
it
was
all
a
dream
then
he
laid
himself
heavily
down
again
with
a
groan
and
the
muttered
words
a
nigger
i
am
a
nigger
oh
i
wish
i
was
dead
he
woke
at
dawn
with
one
more
repetition
of
this
horror
and
then
he
resolved
to
meddle
no
more
with
that
treacherous
sleep
he
began
to
think
sufficiently
bitter
thinkings
they
were
they
wandered
along
something
after
this
fashion
why
were
niggers
and
whites
made
what
crime
did
the
uncreated
first
nigger
commit
that
the
curse
of
birth
was
decreed
for
him
and
why
is
this
awful
difference
made
between
white
and
black
how
hard
the
nigger
fate
seems
this
morning
yet
until
last
night
such
a
thought
never
entered
my
head
he
sighed
and
groaned
an
hour
or
more
away
then
chambers
came
humbly
in
to
say
that
breakfast
was
nearly
ready
tom
blushed
scarlet
to
see
this
aristocratic
white
youth
cringe
to
him
a
nigger
and
call
him
young
marster
he
said
roughly
get
out
of
my
sight
and
when
the
youth
was
gone
he
muttered
he
has
done
me
no
harm
poor
wretch
but
he
is
an
eyesore
to
me
now
for
he
is
driscoll
the
young
gentleman
and
i
am
a
oh
i
wish
i
was
dead
a
gigantic
irruption
like
that
of
krakatoa
a
few
years
ago
with
the
accompanying
earthquakes
tidal
waves
and
clouds
of
volcanic
dust
changes
the
face
of
the
surrounding
landscape
beyond
recognition
bringing
down
the
high
lands
elevating
the
low
making
fair
lakes
where
deserts
had
been
and
deserts
where
green
prairies
had
smiled
before
the
tremendous
catastrophe
which
had
befallen
tom
had
changed
his
moral
landscape
in
much
the
same
way
some
of
his
low
places
he
found
lifted
to
ideals
some
of
his
ideals
had
sunk
to
the
valleys
and
lay
there
with
the
sackcloth
and
ashes
of
and
sulphur
on
their
ruined
heads
for
days
he
wandered
in
lonely
places
thinking
thinking
thinking
trying
to
get
his
bearings
it
was
new
work
if
he
met
a
friend
he
found
that
the
habit
of
a
lifetime
had
in
some
mysterious
way
vanished
his
arm
hung
limp
instead
of
involuntarily
extending
the
hand
for
a
shake
it
was
the
nigger
in
him
asserting
its
humility
and
he
blushed
and
was
abashed
and
the
nigger
in
him
was
surprised
when
the
white
friend
put
out
his
hand
for
a
shake
with
him
he
found
the
nigger
in
him
involuntarily
giving
the
road
on
the
sidewalk
to
a
white
rowdy
and
loafer
when
rowena
the
dearest
thing
his
heart
knew
the
idol
of
his
secret
worship
invited
him
in
the
nigger
in
him
made
an
embarrassed
excuse
and
was
afraid
to
enter
and
sit
with
the
dread
white
folks
on
equal
terms
the
nigger
in
him
went
shrinking
and
skulking
here
and
there
and
yonder
and
fancying
it
saw
suspicion
and
maybe
detection
in
all
faces
tones
and
gestures
so
strange
and
uncharacteristic
was
tom
conduct
that
people
noticed
it
and
turned
to
look
after
him
when
he
passed
on
and
when
he
glanced
back
as
he
could
not
help
doing
in
spite
of
his
best
resistance
and
caught
that
puzzled
expression
in
a
person
face
it
gave
him
a
sick
feeling
and
he
took
himself
out
of
view
as
quickly
as
he
could
he
presently
came
to
have
a
hunted
sense
and
a
hunted
look
and
then
he
fled
away
to
the
and
the
solitudes
he
said
to
himself
that
the
curse
of
ham
was
upon
him
he
dreaded
his
meals
the
nigger
in
him
was
ashamed
to
sit
at
the
white
folks
table
and
feared
discovery
all
the
time
and
once
when
judge
driscoll
said
what
the
matter
with
you
you
look
as
meek
as
a
nigger
he
felt
as
secret
murderers
are
said
to
feel
when
the
accuser
says
thou
art
the
man
tom
said
he
was
not
well
and
left
the
table
his
ostensible
aunt
solicitudes
and
endearments
were
become
a
terror
to
him
and
he
avoided
them
and
all
the
time
hatred
of
his
ostensible
uncle
was
steadily
growing
in
his
heart
for
he
said
to
himself
he
is
white
and
i
am
his
chattel
his
property
his
goods
and
he
can
sell
me
just
as
he
could
his
dog
for
as
much
as
a
week
after
this
tom
imagined
that
his
character
had
undergone
a
pretty
radical
change
but
that
was
because
he
did
not
know
himself
in
several
ways
his
opinions
were
totally
changed
and
would
never
go
back
to
what
they
were
before
but
the
main
structure
of
his
character
was
not
changed
and
could
not
be
changed
one
or
two
very
important
features
of
it
were
altered
and
in
time
effects
would
result
from
this
if
opportunity
offered
effects
of
a
quite
serious
nature
too
under
the
influence
of
a
great
mental
and
moral
upheaval
his
character
and
habits
had
taken
on
the
appearance
of
complete
change
but
after
a
while
with
the
subsidence
of
the
storm
both
began
to
settle
toward
their
former
places
he
dropped
gradually
back
into
his
old
frivolous
and
ways
and
conditions
of
feeling
and
manner
of
speech
and
no
familiar
of
his
could
have
detected
anything
in
him
that
differentiated
him
from
the
weak
and
careless
tom
of
other
days
the
which
he
had
made
upon
the
village
turned
out
better
than
he
had
ventured
to
hope
it
produced
the
sum
necessary
to
pay
his
and
saved
him
from
exposure
to
his
uncle
and
another
smashing
of
the
will
he
and
his
mother
learned
to
like
each
other
fairly
well
she
could
love
him
as
yet
because
there
nothing
to
him
as
she
expressed
it
but
her
nature
needed
something
or
somebody
to
rule
over
and
he
was
better
than
nothing
her
strong
character
and
aggressive
and
commanding
ways
compelled
tom
admiration
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
got
more
illustrations
of
them
than
he
needed
for
his
comfort
however
as
a
rule
her
conversation
was
made
up
of
racy
tattle
about
the
privacies
of
the
chief
families
of
the
town
for
she
went
harvesting
among
their
kitchens
every
time
she
came
to
the
village
and
tom
enjoyed
this
it
was
just
in
his
line
she
always
collected
her
half
of
his
pension
punctually
and
he
was
always
at
the
haunted
house
to
have
a
chat
with
her
on
these
occasions
every
now
and
then
she
paid
him
a
visit
there
on
also
occasionally
he
would
run
up
to
louis
for
a
few
weeks
and
at
last
temptation
caught
him
again
he
won
a
lot
of
money
but
lost
it
and
with
it
a
deal
more
besides
which
he
promised
to
raise
as
soon
as
possible
for
this
purpose
he
projected
a
new
raid
on
his
town
he
never
meddled
with
any
other
town
for
he
was
afraid
to
venture
into
houses
whose
ins
and
outs
he
did
not
know
and
the
habits
of
whose
households
he
was
not
acquainted
with
he
arrived
at
the
haunted
house
in
disguise
on
the
wednesday
before
the
advent
of
the
twins
after
writing
his
aunt
pratt
that
he
would
not
arrive
until
two
days
after
and
lay
in
hiding
there
with
his
mother
until
toward
daylight
friday
morning
when
he
went
to
his
uncle
house
and
entered
by
the
back
way
with
his
own
key
and
slipped
up
to
his
room
where
he
could
have
the
use
of
the
mirror
and
toilet
articles
he
had
a
suit
of
girl
clothes
with
him
in
a
bundle
as
a
disguise
for
his
raid
and
was
wearing
a
suit
of
his
clothing
with
black
gloves
and
veil
by
dawn
he
was
tricked
out
for
his
raid
but
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
wilson
through
the
window
over
the
way
and
knew
that
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
so
he
entertained
wilson
with
some
airs
and
graces
and
attitudes
for
a
while
then
stepped
out
of
sight
and
resumed
the
other
disguise
and
by
and
by
went
down
and
out
the
back
way
and
started
down
town
to
reconnoiter
the
scene
of
his
intended
labors
but
he
was
ill
at
ease
he
had
changed
back
to
roxy
dress
with
the
stoop
of
age
added
to
the
disguise
so
that
wilson
would
not
bother
himself
about
a
humble
old
woman
leaving
a
neighbor
house
by
the
back
way
in
the
early
morning
in
case
he
was
still
spying
but
supposing
wilson
had
seen
him
leave
and
had
thought
it
suspicious
and
had
also
followed
him
the
thought
made
tom
cold
he
gave
up
the
raid
for
the
day
and
hurried
back
to
the
haunted
house
by
the
obscurest
route
he
knew
his
mother
was
gone
but
she
came
back
by
and
by
with
the
news
of
the
grand
reception
at
patsy
cooper
and
soon
persuaded
him
that
the
opportunity
was
like
a
special
providence
it
was
so
inviting
and
perfect
so
he
went
raiding
after
all
and
made
a
nice
success
of
it
while
everybody
was
gone
to
patsy
cooper
success
gave
him
nerve
and
even
actual
intrepidity
insomuch
indeed
that
after
he
had
conveyed
his
harvest
to
his
mother
in
a
back
alley
he
went
to
the
reception
himself
and
added
several
of
the
valuables
of
that
house
to
his
takings
after
this
long
digression
we
have
now
arrived
once
more
at
the
point
where
wilson
while
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
twins
on
that
same
friday
evening
sat
puzzling
over
the
strange
apparition
of
that
morning
a
girl
in
young
tom
driscoll
bedroom
fretting
and
guessing
and
puzzling
over
it
and
wondering
who
the
shameless
creature
might
be
chapter
xi
startling
discovery
there
are
three
infallible
ways
of
pleasing
an
author
and
the
three
form
a
rising
scale
of
compliment
to
tell
him
you
have
read
one
of
his
books
to
tell
him
you
have
read
all
of
his
books
to
ask
him
to
let
you
read
the
manuscript
of
his
forthcoming
book
no
admits
you
to
his
respect
no
admits
you
to
his
admiration
no
carries
you
clear
into
his
wilson
calendar
as
to
the
adjective
when
in
doubt
strike
it
calendar
the
twins
arrived
presently
and
talk
began
it
flowed
along
chattily
and
sociably
and
under
its
influence
the
new
friendship
gathered
ease
and
strength
wilson
got
out
his
calendar
by
request
and
read
a
passage
or
two
from
it
which
the
twins
praised
quite
cordially
this
pleased
the
author
so
much
that
he
complied
gladly
when
they
asked
him
to
lend
them
a
batch
of
the
work
to
read
at
home
in
the
course
of
their
wide
travels
they
had
found
out
that
there
are
three
sure
ways
of
pleasing
an
author
they
were
now
working
the
best
of
the
three
there
was
an
interruption
now
young
tom
driscoll
appeared
and
joined
the
party
he
pretended
to
be
seeing
the
distinguished
strangers
for
the
first
time
when
they
rose
to
shake
hands
but
this
was
only
a
blind
as
he
had
already
had
a
glimpse
of
them
at
the
reception
while
robbing
the
house
the
twins
made
mental
note
that
he
was
and
rather
handsome
and
smooth
and
undulatory
in
his
movements
graceful
in
fact
angelo
thought
he
had
a
good
eye
luigi
thought
there
was
something
veiled
and
sly
about
it
angelo
thought
he
had
a
pleasant
way
of
talking
luigi
thought
it
was
more
so
than
was
agreeable
angelo
thought
he
was
a
sufficiently
nice
young
man
luigi
reserved
his
decision
tom
first
contribution
to
the
conversation
was
a
question
which
he
had
put
to
wilson
a
hundred
times
before
it
was
always
cheerily
and
put
and
always
inflicted
a
little
pang
for
it
touched
a
secret
sore
but
this
time
the
pang
was
sharp
since
strangers
were
present
well
how
does
the
law
come
on
had
a
case
yet
wilson
bit
his
lip
but
answered
no
not
yet
with
as
much
indifference
as
he
could
assume
judge
driscoll
had
generously
left
the
law
feature
out
of
the
wilson
biography
which
he
had
furnished
to
the
twins
young
tom
laughed
pleasantly
and
said
wilson
a
lawyer
gentlemen
but
he
does
practise
now
the
sarcasm
bit
but
wilson
kept
himself
under
control
and
said
without
passion
i
do
practise
it
is
true
it
is
true
that
i
have
never
had
a
case
and
have
had
to
earn
a
poor
living
for
twenty
years
as
an
expert
accountant
in
a
town
where
i
ca
get
hold
of
a
set
of
books
to
untangle
as
often
as
i
should
like
but
it
is
also
true
that
i
did
fit
myself
well
for
the
practice
of
the
law
by
the
time
i
was
your
age
tom
i
had
chosen
a
profession
and
was
soon
competent
to
enter
upon
it
tom
winced
i
never
got
a
chance
to
try
my
hand
at
it
and
i
may
never
get
a
chance
and
yet
if
i
ever
do
get
it
i
shall
be
found
ready
for
i
have
kept
up
my
all
these
years
that
it
that
good
grit
i
like
to
see
it
i
a
notion
to
throw
all
my
business
your
way
my
business
and
your
ought
to
make
a
pretty
gay
team
dave
and
the
young
fellow
laughed
again
if
you
will
throw
wilson
had
thought
of
the
girl
in
tom
bedroom
and
was
going
to
say
if
you
will
throw
the
surreptitious
and
disreputable
part
of
your
business
my
way
it
may
amount
to
something
but
thought
better
of
it
and
said
however
this
matter
does
fit
well
in
a
general
conversation
all
right
we
change
the
subject
i
guess
you
were
about
to
give
me
another
dig
anyway
so
i
willing
to
change
how
the
awful
mystery
flourishing
these
days
wilson
got
a
scheme
for
driving
plain
out
of
the
market
by
decorating
it
with
greasy
and
getting
rich
by
selling
it
at
famine
prices
to
the
crowned
heads
over
in
europe
to
outfit
their
palaces
with
fetch
it
out
dave
wilson
brought
three
of
his
glass
strips
and
said
i
get
the
subject
to
pass
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
through
his
hair
so
as
to
get
a
little
coating
of
the
natural
oil
on
them
and
then
press
the
balls
of
them
on
the
glass
a
fine
and
delicate
print
of
the
lines
in
the
skin
results
and
is
permanent
if
it
does
come
in
contact
with
something
able
to
rub
it
off
you
begin
tom
why
i
think
you
took
my
once
or
twice
before
yes
but
you
were
a
little
boy
the
last
time
only
about
twelve
years
old
that
so
of
course
i
changed
entirely
since
then
and
variety
is
what
the
crowned
heads
want
i
guess
he
passed
his
fingers
through
his
crop
of
short
hair
and
pressed
them
one
at
a
time
on
the
glass
angelo
made
a
print
of
his
fingers
on
another
glass
and
luigi
followed
with
the
third
wilson
marked
the
glasses
with
names
and
date
and
put
them
away
tom
gave
one
of
his
little
laughs
and
said
i
thought
i
would
say
anything
but
if
variety
is
what
you
are
after
you
have
wasted
a
piece
of
glass
the
of
one
twin
is
the
same
as
the
of
the
well
it
done
now
and
i
like
to
have
them
both
anyway
said
wilson
returning
to
his
place
but
look
here
dave
said
tom
you
used
to
tell
people
fortunes
too
when
you
took
their
dave
just
an
genius
a
genius
of
the
first
water
gentlemen
a
great
scientist
running
to
seed
here
in
this
village
a
prophet
with
the
kind
of
honor
that
prophets
generally
get
at
home
for
here
they
do
give
shucks
for
his
scientifics
and
they
call
his
skull
a
hey
dave
ai
it
so
but
never
mind
he
make
his
mark
some
day
you
know
but
really
you
want
to
let
him
take
a
shy
at
your
palms
once
it
worth
twice
the
price
of
admission
or
your
returned
at
the
door
why
he
read
your
wrinkles
as
easy
as
a
book
and
not
only
tell
you
fifty
or
sixty
things
that
going
to
happen
to
you
but
fifty
or
sixty
thousand
that
ai
come
dave
show
the
gentlemen
what
an
inspired
we
got
in
this
town
and
do
know
it
wilson
winced
under
this
nagging
and
not
very
courteous
chaff
and
the
twins
suffered
with
him
and
for
him
they
rightly
judged
now
that
the
best
way
to
relieve
him
would
be
to
take
the
thing
in
earnest
and
treat
it
with
respect
ignoring
tom
rather
overdone
raillery
so
luigi
said
we
have
seen
something
of
palmistry
in
our
wanderings
and
know
very
well
what
astonishing
things
it
can
do
if
it
is
a
science
and
one
of
the
greatest
of
them
too
i
do
know
what
its
other
name
ought
to
be
in
the
orient
tom
looked
surprised
and
incredulous
he
said
that
juggling
a
science
but
really
you
ai
serious
are
you
yes
entirely
so
four
years
ago
we
had
our
hands
read
out
to
us
as
if
our
palms
had
been
covered
with
print
well
do
you
mean
to
say
there
was
actually
anything
in
it
asked
tom
his
incredulity
beginning
to
weaken
a
little
there
was
this
much
in
it
said
angelo
what
was
told
us
of
our
characters
was
minutely
exact
we
could
not
have
bettered
it
ourselves
next
two
or
three
memorable
things
that
had
happened
to
us
were
laid
bare
things
which
no
one
present
but
ourselves
could
have
known
about
why
it
rank
sorcery
exclaimed
tom
who
was
now
becoming
very
much
interested
and
how
did
they
make
out
with
what
was
going
to
happen
to
you
in
the
future
on
the
whole
quite
fairly
said
luigi
two
or
three
of
the
most
striking
things
foretold
have
happened
since
much
the
most
striking
one
of
all
happened
within
that
same
year
some
of
the
minor
prophecies
have
come
true
some
of
the
minor
and
some
of
the
major
ones
have
not
been
fulfilled
yet
and
of
course
may
never
be
still
i
should
be
more
surprised
if
they
failed
to
arrive
than
if
they
did
tom
was
entirely
sobered
and
profoundly
impressed
he
said
apologetically
dave
i
was
meaning
to
belittle
that
science
i
was
only
chaffing
chattering
i
reckon
i
better
say
i
wish
you
would
look
at
their
palms
come
wo
you
why
certainly
if
you
want
me
to
but
you
know
i
had
no
chance
to
become
an
expert
and
do
claim
to
be
one
when
a
past
event
is
somewhat
prominently
recorded
in
the
palm
i
can
generally
detect
that
but
minor
ones
often
escape
me
not
always
of
course
but
often
but
i
have
much
confidence
in
myself
when
it
comes
to
reading
the
future
i
am
talking
as
if
palmistry
was
a
daily
study
with
me
but
that
is
not
so
i
have
examined
half
a
dozen
hands
in
the
last
half
dozen
years
you
see
the
people
got
to
joking
about
it
and
i
stopped
to
let
the
talk
die
down
i
tell
you
what
we
do
count
luigi
i
make
a
try
at
your
past
and
if
i
have
any
success
there
no
on
the
whole
let
the
future
alone
that
really
the
affair
of
an
expert
he
took
luigi
hand
tom
said
wait
do
look
yet
dave
count
luigi
here
paper
and
pencil
set
down
that
thing
that
you
said
was
the
most
striking
one
that
was
foretold
to
you
and
happened
less
than
a
year
afterward
and
give
it
to
me
so
i
can
see
if
dave
finds
it
in
your
hand
luigi
wrote
a
line
privately
and
folded
up
the
piece
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
tom
saying
i
tell
you
when
to
look
at
it
if
he
finds
it
wilson
began
to
study
luigi
palm
tracing
life
lines
heart
lines
head
lines
and
so
on
and
noting
carefully
their
relations
with
the
cobweb
of
finer
and
more
delicate
marks
and
lines
that
enmeshed
them
on
all
sides
he
felt
of
the
fleshy
cushion
at
the
base
of
the
thumb
and
noted
its
shape
he
felt
of
the
fleshy
side
of
the
hand
between
the
wrist
and
the
base
of
the
little
finger
and
noted
its
shape
also
he
painstakingly
examined
the
fingers
observing
their
form
proportions
and
natural
manner
of
disposing
themselves
when
in
repose
all
this
process
was
watched
by
the
three
spectators
with
absorbing
interest
their
heads
bent
together
over
luigi
palm
and
nobody
disturbing
the
stillness
with
a
word
wilson
now
entered
upon
a
close
survey
of
the
palm
again
and
his
revelations
began
he
mapped
out
luigi
character
and
disposition
his
tastes
aversions
proclivities
ambitions
and
eccentricities
in
a
way
which
sometimes
made
luigi
wince
and
the
others
laugh
but
both
twins
declared
that
the
chart
was
artistically
drawn
and
was
correct
next
wilson
took
up
luigi
history
he
proceeded
cautiously
and
with
hesitation
now
moving
his
finger
slowly
along
the
great
lines
of
the
palm
and
now
and
then
halting
it
at
a
star
or
some
such
landmark
and
examining
that
neighborhood
minutely
he
proclaimed
one
or
two
past
events
luigi
confirmed
his
correctness
and
the
search
went
on
presently
wilson
glanced
up
suddenly
with
a
surprised
expression
here
is
a
record
of
an
incident
which
you
would
perhaps
not
wish
me
to
bring
it
out
said
luigi
i
promise
you
it
embarrass
me
but
wilson
still
hesitated
and
did
not
seem
quite
to
know
what
to
do
then
he
said
i
think
it
is
too
delicate
a
matter
to
to
i
believe
i
would
rather
write
it
or
whisper
it
to
you
and
let
you
decide
for
yourself
whether
you
want
it
talked
out
or
not
that
will
answer
said
luigi
write
it
wilson
wrote
something
on
a
slip
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
luigi
who
read
it
to
himself
and
said
to
tom
unfold
your
slip
and
read
it
mr
driscoll
tom
read
it
was
prophesied
that
i
would
kill
a
man
it
came
true
before
the
year
was
out
tom
added
great
scott
luigi
handed
wilson
paper
to
tom
and
said
now
read
this
one
tom
read
you
have
killed
some
one
but
whether
man
woman
or
child
i
do
not
make
out
cæsar
ghost
commented
tom
with
astonishment
it
beats
anything
that
was
ever
heard
of
why
a
man
own
hand
is
his
deadliest
enemy
just
think
of
that
a
man
own
hand
keeps
a
record
of
the
deepest
and
fatalest
secrets
of
his
life
and
is
treacherously
ready
to
expose
him
to
any
stranger
that
comes
along
but
what
do
you
let
a
person
look
at
your
hand
for
with
that
awful
thing
printed
on
it
oh
said
luigi
reposefully
i
do
mind
it
i
killed
the
man
for
good
reasons
and
i
do
regret
it
what
were
the
reasons
well
he
needed
killing
i
tell
you
why
he
did
it
since
he
wo
say
himself
said
angelo
warmly
he
did
it
to
save
my
life
that
what
he
did
it
for
so
it
was
a
noble
act
and
not
a
thing
to
be
hid
in
the
dark
so
it
was
so
it
was
said
wilson
to
do
such
a
thing
to
save
a
brother
life
is
a
great
and
fine
action
now
come
said
luigi
it
is
very
pleasant
to
hear
you
say
these
things
but
for
unselfishness
or
heroism
or
magnanimity
the
circumstances
wo
stand
scrutiny
you
overlook
one
detail
suppose
i
had
saved
angelo
life
what
would
have
become
of
mine
if
i
had
let
the
man
kill
him
would
he
have
killed
me
too
i
saved
my
own
life
you
see
yes
that
is
your
way
of
talking
said
angelo
but
i
know
you
i
do
believe
you
thought
of
yourself
at
all
i
keep
that
weapon
yet
that
luigi
killed
the
man
with
and
i
show
it
to
you
sometime
that
incident
makes
it
interesting
and
it
had
a
history
before
it
came
into
luigi
hands
which
adds
to
its
interest
it
was
given
to
luigi
by
a
great
indian
prince
the
gaikowar
of
baroda
and
it
had
been
in
his
family
two
or
three
centuries
it
killed
a
good
many
disagreeable
people
who
troubled
that
hearthstone
at
one
time
and
another
it
is
much
too
look
at
except
that
it
is
shaped
like
other
knives
or
dirks
or
whatever
it
may
be
called
here
i
draw
it
for
you
he
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
made
a
rapid
sketch
there
it
is
a
broad
and
murderous
blade
with
edges
like
a
razor
for
sharpness
the
devices
engraved
on
it
are
the
ciphers
or
names
of
its
long
line
of
possessors
i
had
name
added
in
roman
letters
myself
with
our
coat
of
arms
as
you
see
you
notice
what
a
curious
handle
the
thing
has
it
is
solid
ivory
polished
like
a
mirror
and
is
four
or
five
inches
long
round
and
as
thick
as
a
large
man
wrist
with
the
end
squared
off
flat
for
your
thumb
to
rest
on
for
you
grasp
it
with
your
thumb
resting
on
the
blunt
end
so
and
lift
it
aloft
and
strike
downward
the
gaikowar
showed
us
how
the
thing
was
done
when
he
gave
it
to
luigi
and
before
that
night
was
ended
luigi
had
used
the
knife
and
the
gaikowar
was
a
man
short
by
reason
of
it
the
sheath
is
magnificently
ornamented
with
gems
of
great
value
you
will
find
the
sheath
more
worth
looking
at
than
the
knife
itself
of
course
tom
said
to
himself
it
lucky
i
came
here
i
would
have
sold
that
knife
for
a
song
i
supposed
the
jewels
were
glass
but
go
on
do
stop
said
wilson
our
curiosity
is
up
now
to
hear
about
the
homicide
tell
us
about
that
well
briefly
the
knife
was
to
blame
for
that
all
around
a
native
servant
slipped
into
our
room
in
the
palace
in
the
night
to
kill
us
and
steal
the
knife
on
account
of
the
fortune
incrusted
on
its
sheath
without
a
doubt
luigi
had
it
under
his
pillow
we
were
in
bed
together
there
was
a
dim
burning
i
was
asleep
but
luigi
was
awake
and
he
thought
he
detected
a
vague
form
nearing
the
bed
he
slipped
the
knife
out
of
the
sheath
and
was
ready
and
unembarrassed
by
hampering
for
the
weather
was
hot
and
we
had
any
suddenly
that
native
rose
at
the
bedside
and
bent
over
me
with
his
right
hand
lifted
and
a
dirk
in
it
aimed
at
my
throat
but
luigi
grabbed
his
wrist
pulled
him
downward
and
drove
his
own
knife
into
the
man
neck
that
is
the
whole
story
wilson
and
tom
drew
deep
breaths
and
after
some
general
chat
about
the
tragedy
said
taking
tom
hand
now
tom
i
never
had
a
look
at
your
palms
as
it
happens
perhaps
you
got
some
little
questionable
privacies
that
need
tom
had
snatched
away
his
hand
and
was
looking
a
good
deal
confused
why
he
blushing
said
luigi
tom
darted
an
ugly
look
at
him
and
said
sharply
well
if
i
am
it
ai
because
i
a
murderer
luigi
dark
face
flushed
but
before
he
could
speak
or
move
tom
added
with
anxious
haste
oh
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
i
did
mean
that
it
was
out
before
i
thought
and
i
very
very
sorry
you
must
forgive
me
wilson
came
to
the
rescue
and
smoothed
things
down
as
well
as
he
could
and
in
fact
was
entirely
successful
as
far
as
the
twins
were
concerned
for
they
felt
sorrier
for
the
affront
put
upon
him
by
his
outburst
of
ill
manners
than
for
the
insult
offered
to
luigi
but
the
success
was
not
so
pronounced
with
the
offender
tom
tried
to
seem
at
his
ease
and
he
went
through
the
motions
fairly
well
but
at
bottom
he
felt
resentful
toward
all
the
three
witnesses
of
his
exhibition
in
fact
he
felt
so
annoyed
at
them
for
having
witnessed
it
and
noticed
it
that
he
almost
forgot
to
feel
annoyed
at
himself
for
placing
it
before
them
however
something
presently
happened
which
made
him
almost
comfortable
and
brought
him
nearly
back
to
a
state
of
charity
and
friendliness
this
was
a
little
spat
between
the
twins
not
much
of
a
spat
but
still
a
spat
and
before
they
got
far
with
it
they
were
in
a
decided
condition
of
irritation
with
each
other
tom
was
charmed
so
pleased
indeed
that
he
cautiously
did
what
he
could
to
increase
the
irritation
while
pretending
to
be
actuated
by
more
respectable
motives
by
his
help
the
fire
got
warmed
up
to
the
and
he
might
have
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
the
flames
show
up
in
another
moment
but
for
the
interruption
of
a
knock
on
the
door
an
interruption
which
fretted
him
as
much
as
it
gratified
wilson
wilson
opened
the
door
the
visitor
was
a
ignorant
energetic
irishman
named
john
buckstone
who
was
a
great
politician
in
a
small
way
and
always
took
a
large
share
in
public
matters
of
every
sort
one
of
the
town
chief
excitements
just
now
was
over
the
matter
of
rum
there
was
a
strong
rum
party
and
a
strong
party
buckstone
was
training
with
the
rum
party
and
he
had
been
sent
to
hunt
up
the
twins
and
invite
them
to
attend
a
of
that
faction
he
delivered
his
errand
and
said
the
clans
were
already
gathering
in
the
big
hall
over
the
luigi
accepted
the
invitation
cordially
angelo
less
cordially
since
he
disliked
crowds
and
did
not
drink
the
powerful
intoxicants
of
america
in
fact
he
was
even
a
teetotaler
sometimes
when
it
was
judicious
to
be
one
the
twins
left
with
buckstone
and
tom
driscoll
joined
company
with
them
uninvited
in
the
distance
one
could
see
a
long
wavering
line
of
torches
drifting
down
the
main
street
and
could
hear
the
throbbing
of
the
bass
drum
the
clash
of
cymbals
the
squeaking
of
a
fife
or
two
and
the
faint
roar
of
remote
hurrahs
the
of
this
procession
was
climbing
the
stairs
when
the
twins
arrived
in
its
neighborhood
when
they
reached
the
hall
it
was
full
of
people
torches
smoke
noise
and
enthusiasm
they
were
conducted
to
the
platform
by
buckstone
tom
driscoll
still
following
and
were
delivered
to
the
chairman
in
the
midst
of
a
prodigious
explosion
of
welcome
when
the
noise
had
moderated
a
little
the
chair
proposed
that
our
illustrious
guests
be
at
once
elected
by
complimentary
acclamation
to
membership
in
our
organization
the
paradise
of
the
free
and
the
perdition
of
the
slave
this
eloquent
discharge
opened
the
of
enthusiasm
again
and
the
election
was
carried
with
thundering
unanimity
then
arose
a
storm
of
cries
wet
them
down
wet
them
down
give
them
a
drink
glasses
of
whisky
were
handed
to
the
twins
luigi
waved
his
aloft
then
brought
it
to
his
lips
but
angelo
set
his
down
there
was
another
storm
of
cries
what
the
matter
with
the
other
one
what
is
the
blond
one
going
back
on
us
for
explain
explain
the
chairman
inquired
and
then
reported
we
have
made
an
unfortunate
mistake
gentlemen
i
find
that
the
count
angelo
capello
is
opposed
to
our
creed
is
a
teetotaler
in
fact
and
was
not
intending
to
apply
for
membership
with
us
he
desires
that
we
reconsider
the
vote
by
which
he
was
elected
what
is
the
pleasure
of
the
house
there
was
a
general
burst
of
laughter
plentifully
accented
with
whistlings
and
but
the
energetic
use
of
the
gavel
presently
restored
something
like
order
then
a
man
spoke
from
the
crowd
and
said
that
while
he
was
very
sorry
that
the
mistake
had
been
made
it
would
not
be
possible
to
rectify
it
at
the
present
meeting
according
to
the
it
must
go
over
to
the
next
regular
meeting
for
action
he
would
not
offer
a
motion
as
none
was
required
he
desired
to
apologize
to
the
gentleman
in
the
name
of
the
house
and
begged
to
assure
him
that
as
far
as
it
might
lie
in
the
power
of
the
sons
of
liberty
his
temporary
membership
in
the
order
would
be
made
pleasant
to
him
this
speech
was
received
with
great
applause
mixed
with
cries
of
that
the
talk
he
a
good
fellow
anyway
if
he
is
a
teetotaler
drink
his
health
give
him
a
rouser
and
no
heeltaps
glasses
were
handed
around
and
everybody
on
the
platform
drank
health
while
the
house
bellowed
forth
in
song
for
he
a
jolly
good
for
he
a
jolly
good
for
he
a
jolly
good
which
nobody
can
deny
tom
driscoll
drank
it
was
his
second
glass
for
he
had
drunk
the
moment
that
angelo
had
set
it
down
the
two
drinks
made
him
very
merry
almost
idiotically
so
and
he
began
to
take
a
most
lively
and
prominent
part
in
the
proceedings
particularly
in
the
music
and
and
the
chairman
was
still
standing
at
the
front
the
twins
at
his
side
the
extraordinarily
close
resemblance
of
the
brothers
to
each
other
suggested
a
witticism
to
tom
driscoll
and
just
as
the
chairman
began
a
speech
he
skipped
forward
and
said
with
an
air
of
tipsy
confidence
to
the
audience
boys
i
move
that
he
keeps
still
and
lets
this
human
philopena
snip
you
out
a
speech
the
descriptive
aptness
of
the
phrase
caught
the
house
and
a
mighty
burst
of
laughter
followed
luigi
southern
blood
leaped
to
the
in
a
moment
under
the
sharp
humiliation
of
this
insult
delivered
in
the
presence
of
four
hundred
strangers
it
was
not
in
the
young
man
nature
to
let
the
matter
pass
or
to
delay
the
squaring
of
the
account
he
took
a
couple
of
strides
and
halted
behind
the
unsuspecting
joker
then
he
drew
back
and
delivered
a
kick
of
such
titanic
vigor
that
it
lifted
tom
clear
over
the
footlights
and
landed
him
on
the
heads
of
the
front
row
of
the
sons
of
liberty
even
a
sober
person
does
not
like
to
have
a
human
being
emptied
on
him
when
he
is
not
doing
any
harm
a
person
who
is
not
sober
can
not
endure
such
an
attention
at
all
the
nest
of
sons
of
liberty
that
driscoll
landed
in
had
not
a
sober
bird
in
it
in
fact
there
was
probably
not
an
entirely
sober
one
in
the
auditorium
driscoll
was
promptly
and
indignantly
flung
on
to
the
heads
of
sons
in
the
next
row
and
these
sons
passed
him
on
toward
the
rear
and
then
immediately
began
to
pummel
the
sons
who
had
passed
him
to
them
this
course
was
strictly
followed
by
bench
after
bench
as
driscoll
traveled
in
his
tumultuous
and
airy
flight
toward
the
door
so
he
left
behind
him
an
ever
lengthening
wake
of
raging
and
plunging
and
fighting
and
swearing
humanity
down
went
group
after
group
of
torches
and
presently
above
the
deafening
clatter
of
the
gavel
roar
of
angry
voices
and
crash
of
succumbing
benches
rose
the
paralyzing
cry
of
fire
the
fighting
ceased
instantly
the
cursing
ceased
for
one
distinctly
defined
moment
there
was
a
dead
hush
a
motionless
calm
where
the
tempest
had
been
then
with
one
impulse
the
multitude
awoke
to
life
and
energy
again
and
went
surging
and
struggling
and
swaying
this
way
and
that
its
outer
edges
melting
away
through
windows
and
doors
and
gradually
lessening
the
pressure
and
relieving
the
mass
the
were
never
on
hand
so
suddenly
before
for
there
was
no
distance
to
go
this
time
their
quarters
being
in
the
rear
end
of
the
there
was
an
engine
company
and
a
company
half
of
each
was
composed
of
rummies
and
the
other
half
of
after
the
moral
and
political
fashion
of
the
frontier
town
of
the
period
enough
were
loafing
in
quarters
to
man
the
engine
and
the
ladders
in
two
minutes
they
had
their
red
shirts
and
helmets
on
they
never
stirred
officially
in
unofficial
costume
and
as
the
mass
meeting
overhead
smashed
through
the
long
row
of
windows
and
poured
out
upon
the
roof
of
the
arcade
the
deliverers
were
ready
for
them
with
a
powerful
stream
of
water
which
washed
some
of
them
off
the
roof
and
nearly
drowned
the
rest
but
water
was
preferable
to
fire
and
still
the
stampede
from
the
windows
continued
and
still
the
pitiless
drenching
assailed
it
until
the
building
was
empty
then
the
mounted
to
the
hall
and
flooded
it
with
water
enough
to
annihilate
forty
times
as
much
fire
as
there
was
there
for
a
village
does
not
often
get
a
chance
to
show
off
and
so
when
it
does
get
a
chance
it
makes
the
most
of
it
such
citizens
of
that
village
as
were
of
a
thoughtful
and
judicious
temperament
did
not
insure
against
fire
they
insured
against
the
chapter
xii
the
shame
of
judge
driscoll
courage
is
resistance
to
fear
mastery
of
fear
not
absence
of
fear
except
a
creature
be
part
coward
it
is
not
a
compliment
to
say
it
is
brave
it
is
merely
a
loose
misapplication
of
the
word
consider
the
flea
incomparably
the
bravest
of
all
the
creatures
of
god
if
ignorance
of
fear
were
courage
whether
you
are
asleep
or
awake
he
will
attack
you
caring
nothing
for
the
fact
that
in
bulk
and
strength
you
are
to
him
as
are
the
massed
armies
of
the
earth
to
a
sucking
child
he
lives
both
day
and
night
and
all
days
and
nights
in
the
very
lap
of
peril
and
the
immediate
presence
of
death
and
yet
is
no
more
afraid
than
is
the
man
who
walks
the
streets
of
a
city
that
was
threatened
by
an
earthquake
ten
centuries
before
when
we
speak
of
clive
nelson
and
putnam
as
men
who
did
know
what
fear
was
we
ought
always
to
add
the
flea
and
put
him
at
the
head
of
the
wilson
calendar
judge
driscoll
was
in
bed
and
asleep
by
ten
on
friday
night
and
he
was
up
and
gone
before
daylight
in
the
morning
with
his
friend
pembroke
howard
these
two
had
been
boys
together
in
virginia
when
that
state
still
ranked
as
the
chief
and
most
imposing
member
of
the
union
and
they
still
coupled
the
proud
and
affectionate
adjective
old
with
her
name
when
they
spoke
of
her
in
missouri
a
recognized
superiority
attached
to
any
person
who
hailed
from
old
virginia
and
this
superiority
was
exalted
to
supremacy
when
a
person
of
such
nativity
could
also
prove
descent
from
the
first
families
of
that
great
commonwealth
the
howards
and
driscolls
were
of
this
aristocracy
in
their
eyes
it
was
a
nobility
it
had
its
unwritten
laws
and
they
were
as
clearly
defined
and
as
strict
as
any
that
could
be
found
among
the
printed
statutes
of
the
land
the
was
born
a
gentleman
his
highest
duty
in
life
was
to
watch
over
that
great
inheritance
and
keep
it
unsmirched
he
must
keep
his
honor
spotless
those
laws
were
his
chart
his
course
was
marked
out
on
it
if
he
swerved
from
it
by
so
much
as
half
a
point
of
the
compass
it
meant
shipwreck
to
his
honor
that
is
to
say
degradation
from
his
rank
as
a
gentleman
these
laws
required
certain
things
of
him
which
his
religion
might
forbid
then
his
religion
must
yield
the
laws
could
not
be
relaxed
to
accommodate
religions
or
anything
else
honor
stood
first
and
the
laws
defined
what
it
was
and
wherein
it
differed
in
certain
details
from
honor
as
defined
by
church
creeds
and
by
the
social
laws
and
customs
of
some
of
the
minor
divisions
of
the
globe
that
had
got
crowded
out
when
the
sacred
boundaries
of
virginia
were
staked
out
if
judge
driscoll
was
the
recognized
first
citizen
of
dawson
landing
pembroke
howard
was
easily
its
recognized
second
citizen
he
was
called
the
great
lawyer
an
earned
title
he
and
driscoll
were
of
the
same
age
a
year
or
two
past
sixty
although
driscoll
was
a
and
howard
a
strong
and
determined
presbyterian
their
warm
intimacy
suffered
no
impairment
in
consequence
they
were
men
whose
opinions
were
their
own
property
and
not
subject
to
revision
and
amendment
suggestion
or
criticism
by
anybody
even
their
friends
the
day
fishing
finished
they
came
floating
down
stream
in
their
skiff
talking
national
politics
and
other
high
matters
and
presently
met
a
skiff
coming
up
from
town
with
a
man
in
it
who
said
i
reckon
you
know
one
of
the
new
twins
gave
your
nephew
a
kicking
last
night
judge
did
what
gave
him
a
kicking
the
old
judge
lips
paled
and
his
eyes
began
to
flame
he
choked
with
anger
for
a
moment
then
he
got
out
what
he
was
trying
to
say
well
well
go
on
give
me
the
details
the
man
did
it
at
the
finish
the
judge
was
silent
a
minute
turning
over
in
his
mind
the
shameful
picture
of
tom
flight
over
the
footlights
then
he
said
as
if
musing
aloud
h
i
do
understand
it
i
was
asleep
at
home
he
did
wake
me
thought
he
was
competent
to
manage
his
affair
without
my
help
i
reckon
his
face
lit
up
with
pride
and
pleasure
at
that
thought
and
he
said
with
a
cheery
complacency
i
like
that
it
the
true
old
blood
hey
pembroke
howard
smiled
an
iron
smile
and
nodded
his
head
approvingly
then
the
spoke
again
but
tom
beat
the
twin
on
the
trial
the
judge
looked
at
the
man
wonderingly
and
said
the
trial
what
trial
why
tom
had
him
up
before
judge
robinson
for
assault
and
battery
the
old
man
shrank
suddenly
together
like
one
who
has
received
a
howard
sprang
for
him
as
he
sank
forward
in
a
swoon
and
took
him
in
his
arms
and
bedded
him
on
his
back
in
the
boat
he
sprinkled
water
in
his
face
and
said
to
the
startled
visitor
go
now
do
let
him
come
to
and
find
you
here
you
see
what
an
effect
your
heedless
speech
has
had
you
ought
to
have
been
more
considerate
than
to
blurt
out
such
a
cruel
piece
of
slander
as
that
i
right
down
sorry
i
did
it
now
howard
and
i
would
have
done
it
if
i
had
thought
but
it
ai
slander
it
perfectly
true
just
as
i
told
him
he
rowed
away
presently
the
old
judge
came
out
of
his
faint
and
looked
up
piteously
into
the
sympathetic
face
that
was
bent
over
him
say
it
ai
true
pembroke
tell
me
it
ai
true
he
said
in
a
weak
voice
there
was
nothing
weak
in
the
deep
that
responded
you
know
it
a
lie
as
well
as
i
do
old
friend
he
is
of
the
best
blood
of
the
old
dominion
god
bless
you
for
saying
it
said
the
old
gentleman
fervently
ah
pembroke
it
was
such
a
blow
howard
stayed
by
his
friend
and
saw
him
home
and
entered
the
house
with
him
it
was
dark
and
past
but
the
judge
was
not
thinking
of
supper
he
was
eager
to
hear
the
slander
refuted
from
headquarters
and
as
eager
to
have
howard
hear
it
too
tom
was
sent
for
and
he
came
immediately
he
was
bruised
and
lame
and
was
not
a
object
his
uncle
made
him
sit
down
and
said
we
have
been
hearing
about
your
adventure
tom
with
a
handsome
lie
added
to
it
for
embellishment
now
pulverize
that
lie
to
dust
what
measures
have
you
taken
how
does
the
thing
stand
tom
answered
guilelessly
it
do
stand
at
all
it
all
over
i
had
him
up
in
court
and
beat
him
wilson
defended
him
first
case
he
ever
had
and
lost
it
the
judge
fined
the
miserable
hound
five
dollars
for
the
assault
howard
and
the
judge
sprang
to
their
feet
with
the
opening
sentence
why
neither
knew
then
they
stood
gazing
vacantly
at
each
other
howard
stood
a
moment
then
sat
mournfully
down
without
saying
anything
the
judge
wrath
began
to
kindle
and
he
burst
out
you
cur
you
scum
you
vermin
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
blood
of
my
race
has
suffered
a
blow
and
crawled
to
a
court
of
law
about
it
answer
me
tom
head
drooped
and
he
answered
with
an
eloquent
silence
his
uncle
stared
at
him
with
a
mixed
expression
of
amazement
and
shame
and
incredulity
that
was
sorrowful
to
see
at
last
he
said
which
of
the
twins
was
it
count
luigi
you
have
challenged
him
n
no
hesitated
tom
turning
pale
you
will
challenge
him
howard
will
carry
it
tom
began
to
turn
sick
and
to
show
it
he
turned
his
hat
round
and
round
in
his
hand
his
uncle
glowering
blacker
and
blacker
upon
him
as
the
heavy
seconds
drifted
by
then
at
last
he
began
to
stammer
and
said
piteously
oh
please
do
ask
me
to
do
it
uncle
he
is
a
murderous
devil
i
never
could
i
i
afraid
of
him
old
driscoll
mouth
opened
and
closed
three
times
before
he
could
get
it
to
perform
its
office
then
he
stormed
out
a
coward
in
my
family
a
driscoll
a
coward
oh
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
this
infamy
he
tottered
to
his
secretary
in
the
corner
repeating
that
lament
again
and
again
in
heartbreaking
tones
and
got
out
of
a
drawer
a
paper
which
he
slowly
tore
to
bits
scattering
the
bits
absently
in
his
track
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
still
grieving
and
lamenting
at
last
he
said
there
it
is
shreds
and
fragments
once
more
my
will
once
more
you
have
forced
me
to
disinherit
you
you
base
son
of
a
most
noble
father
leave
my
sight
go
before
i
spit
on
you
the
young
man
did
not
tarry
then
the
judge
turned
to
howard
you
will
be
my
second
old
friend
of
course
there
is
pen
and
paper
draft
the
cartel
and
lose
no
time
the
count
shall
have
it
in
his
hands
in
fifteen
minutes
said
howard
tom
was
very
his
appetite
was
gone
with
his
property
and
his
he
went
out
the
back
way
and
wandered
down
the
obscure
lane
grieving
and
wondering
if
any
course
of
future
conduct
however
discreet
and
carefully
perfected
and
watched
over
could
win
back
his
uncle
favor
and
persuade
him
to
reconstruct
once
more
that
generous
will
which
had
just
gone
to
ruin
before
his
eyes
he
finally
concluded
that
it
could
he
said
to
himself
that
he
had
accomplished
this
sort
of
triumph
once
already
and
that
what
had
been
done
once
could
be
done
again
he
would
set
about
it
he
would
bend
every
energy
to
the
task
and
he
would
score
that
triumph
once
more
cost
what
it
might
to
his
convenience
limit
as
it
might
his
frivolous
and
life
to
begin
he
said
to
himself
i
square
up
with
the
proceeds
of
my
raid
and
then
gambling
has
got
to
be
stopped
and
stopped
short
off
it
the
worst
vice
i
got
from
my
standpoint
anyway
because
the
one
he
can
most
easily
find
out
through
the
impatience
of
my
creditors
he
thought
it
expensive
to
have
to
pay
two
hundred
dollars
to
them
for
me
once
expensive
that
why
it
cost
me
the
whole
of
his
fortune
but
of
course
he
never
thought
of
that
some
people
ca
think
of
any
but
their
own
side
of
a
case
if
he
had
known
how
deep
i
am
in
now
the
will
would
have
gone
to
pot
without
waiting
for
a
duel
to
help
three
hundred
dollars
it
a
pile
but
he
never
hear
of
it
thankful
to
say
the
minute
i
cleared
it
off
i
safe
and
never
touch
a
card
again
anyway
i
wo
while
he
lives
i
make
oath
to
that
i
entering
on
my
last
reform
i
know
it
yes
and
i
win
but
after
that

i
ever
slip
again

march
june
december
august
and
calendar
thus
mournfully
communing
with
himself
tom
moped
along
the
lane
past
wilson
house
and
still
on
and
on
between
fences
inclosing
vacant
country
on
each
hand
till
he
neared
the
haunted
house
then
he
came
moping
back
again
with
many
sighs
and
heavy
with
trouble
he
sorely
wanted
cheerful
company
rowena
his
heart
gave
a
bound
at
the
thought
but
the
next
thought
quieted
it
the
detested
twins
would
be
there
he
was
on
the
inhabited
side
of
wilson
house
and
now
as
he
approached
it
he
noticed
that
the
was
lighted
this
would
do
others
made
him
feel
unwelcome
sometimes
but
wilson
never
failed
in
courtesy
toward
him
and
a
kindly
courtesy
does
at
least
save
one
feelings
even
if
it
is
not
professing
to
stand
for
a
welcome
wilson
heard
footsteps
at
his
threshold
then
the
clearing
of
a
throat
it
that
dissipated
young
goose
poor
devil
he
find
friends
pretty
scarce
likely
after
the
disgrace
of
carrying
a
case
into
a
a
dejected
knock
come
in
tom
entered
and
drooped
into
a
chair
without
saying
anything
wilson
said
kindly
why
my
boy
you
look
desolate
do
take
it
so
hard
try
and
forget
you
have
been
kicked
oh
dear
said
tom
wretchedly
it
not
that
it
not
that
it
a
thousand
times
worse
than
that
oh
yes
a
million
times
worse
why
tom
what
do
you
mean
has
rowena
flung
me
no
but
the
old
man
has
wilson
said
to
himself
aha
and
thought
of
the
mysterious
girl
in
the
bedroom
the
driscolls
have
been
making
discoveries
then
he
said
aloud
gravely
tom
there
are
some
kinds
of
dissipation
which
oh
shucks
this
has
got
anything
to
do
with
dissipation
he
wanted
me
to
challenge
that
derned
italian
savage
and
i
would
do
it
yes
of
course
he
would
do
that
said
wilson
in
a
meditative
way
but
the
thing
that
puzzled
me
was
why
he
look
to
that
last
night
for
one
thing
and
why
he
let
you
carry
such
a
matter
into
a
court
of
law
at
all
either
before
the
duel
or
after
it
it
no
place
for
it
it
was
not
like
him
i
could
understand
it
how
did
it
happen
it
happened
because
he
did
know
anything
about
it
he
was
asleep
when
i
got
home
last
night
and
you
did
wake
him
tom
is
that
possible
tom
was
not
getting
much
comfort
here
he
fidgeted
a
moment
then
said
i
did
choose
to
tell
him
that
all
he
was
going
before
dawn
with
pembroke
howard
and
if
i
got
the
twins
into
the
common
calaboose
and
i
thought
sure
i
could
i
never
dreamed
of
their
slipping
out
on
a
paltry
fine
for
such
an
outrageous
offense
well
once
in
the
calaboose
they
would
be
disgraced
and
uncle
would
want
any
duels
with
that
sort
of
characters
and
would
allow
any
tom
i
am
ashamed
of
you
i
do
see
how
you
could
treat
your
good
old
uncle
so
i
am
a
better
friend
of
his
than
you
are
for
if
i
had
known
the
circumstances
i
would
have
kept
that
case
out
of
court
until
i
got
word
to
him
and
let
him
have
a
gentleman
chance
you
would
exclaimed
tom
with
lively
surprise
and
it
your
first
case
and
you
know
perfectly
well
there
never
would
have
been
any
case
if
he
had
got
that
chance
do
you
and
you
have
finished
your
days
a
pauper
nobody
instead
of
being
an
actually
launched
and
recognized
lawyer
and
you
would
really
have
done
that
would
you
certainly
tom
looked
at
him
a
moment
or
two
then
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
and
said
i
believe
you
upon
my
word
i
do
i
do
know
why
i
do
but
i
do
wilson
i
think
you
the
biggest
fool
i
ever
saw
thank
you
do
mention
it
well
he
has
been
requiring
you
to
fight
the
italian
and
you
have
refused
you
degenerate
remnant
of
an
honorable
line
i
thoroughly
ashamed
of
you
tom
oh
that
nothing
i
do
care
for
anything
now
that
the
will
torn
up
again
tom
tell
me
squarely
did
he
find
any
fault
with
you
for
anything
but
those
two
things
carrying
the
case
into
court
and
refusing
to
fight
he
watched
the
young
fellow
face
narrowly
but
it
was
entirely
reposeful
and
so
also
was
the
voice
that
answered
no
he
did
find
any
other
fault
with
me
if
he
had
had
any
to
find
he
would
have
begun
yesterday
for
he
was
just
in
the
humor
for
it
he
drove
that
around
town
and
showed
them
the
sights
and
when
he
came
home
he
could
find
his
father
old
silver
watch
that
do
keep
time
and
he
thinks
so
much
of
and
could
remember
what
he
did
with
it
three
or
four
days
ago
when
he
saw
it
last
and
so
when
i
arrived
he
was
all
in
a
sweat
about
it
and
when
i
suggested
that
it
probably
lost
but
stolen
it
put
him
in
a
regular
passion
and
he
said
i
was
a
fool
which
convinced
me
without
any
trouble
that
that
was
just
what
he
was
afraid
had
happened
himself
but
did
not
want
to
believe
it
because
lost
things
stand
a
better
chance
of
being
found
again
than
stolen
ones
whistled
wilson
score
another
on
the
list
another
what
another
theft
theft
yes
theft
that
watch
is
lost
it
stolen
there
been
another
raid
on
the
town
and
just
the
same
old
mysterious
sort
of
thing
that
has
happened
once
before
as
you
remember
you
do
mean
it
it
as
sure
as
you
are
born
have
you
missed
anything
yourself
no
that
is
i
did
miss
a
silver
that
aunt
mary
pratt
gave
me
last
birthday
you
find
it
stolen
that
what
you
find
no
i
for
when
i
suggested
theft
about
the
watch
and
got
such
a
rap
i
went
and
examined
my
room
and
the
was
missing
but
it
was
only
mislaid
and
i
found
it
again
you
are
sure
you
missed
nothing
else
well
nothing
of
consequence
i
missed
a
small
plain
gold
ring
worth
two
or
three
dollars
but
that
will
turn
up
i
look
again
in
my
opinion
you
not
find
it
there
been
a
raid
i
tell
you
come
in
justice
robinson
entered
followed
by
buckstone
and
the
jim
blake
they
sat
down
and
after
some
wandering
and
aimless
wilson
said
by
the
way
we
just
added
another
to
the
list
of
thefts
maybe
two
judge
driscoll
old
silver
watch
is
gone
and
tom
here
has
missed
a
gold
ring
well
it
is
a
bad
business
said
the
justice
and
gets
worse
the
further
it
goes
the
hankses
the
dobsons
the
pilligrews
the
ortons
the
grangers
the
hales
the
fullers
the
holcombs
in
fact
everybody
that
lives
around
about
patsy
cooper
has
been
robbed
of
little
things
like
trinkets
and
teaspoons
and
small
valuables
that
are
easily
carried
off
it
perfectly
plain
that
the
thief
took
advantage
of
the
reception
at
patsy
cooper
when
all
the
neighbors
were
in
her
house
and
all
their
niggers
hanging
around
her
fence
for
a
look
at
the
show
to
raid
the
vacant
houses
undisturbed
patsy
is
miserable
about
it
miserable
on
account
of
the
neighbors
and
particularly
miserable
on
account
of
her
foreigners
of
course
so
miserable
on
their
account
that
she
has
any
room
to
worry
about
her
own
little
losses
it
the
same
old
raider
said
wilson
i
suppose
there
is
any
doubt
about
that
constable
blake
does
think
so
no
you
wrong
there
said
blake
the
other
times
it
was
a
man
there
was
plenty
of
signs
of
that
as
we
know
in
the
profession
though
we
never
got
hands
on
him
but
this
time
it
a
woman
wilson
thought
of
the
mysterious
girl
straight
off
she
was
always
in
his
mind
now
but
she
failed
him
again
blake
continued
she
a
old
woman
with
a
covered
basket
on
her
arm
in
a
black
veil
dressed
in
mourning
i
saw
her
going
aboard
the
yesterday
lives
in
illinois
i
reckon
but
i
do
care
where
she
lives
i
going
to
get
her
she
can
make
herself
sure
of
that
what
makes
you
think
she
the
thief
well
there
ai
any
other
for
one
thing
and
for
another
some
nigger
draymen
that
happened
to
be
driving
along
saw
her
coming
out
of
or
going
into
houses
and
told
me
so
and
it
just
happens
that
they
was
robbed
houses
every
time
it
was
granted
that
this
was
plenty
good
enough
circumstantial
evidence
a
pensive
silence
followed
which
lasted
some
moments
then
wilson
said
there
one
good
thing
anyway
she
ca
either
pawn
or
sell
count
luigi
costly
indian
dagger
my
said
tom
is
that
gone
yes
well
that
was
a
haul
but
why
ca
she
pawn
it
or
sell
it
because
when
the
twins
went
home
from
the
sons
of
liberty
meeting
last
night
news
of
the
raid
was
sifting
in
from
everywhere
and
aunt
patsy
was
in
distress
to
know
if
they
had
lost
anything
they
found
that
the
dagger
was
gone
and
they
notified
the
police
and
pawnbrokers
everywhere
it
was
a
great
haul
yes
but
the
old
woman
wo
get
anything
out
of
it
because
she
get
caught
did
they
offer
a
reward
asked
buckstone
yes
five
hundred
dollars
for
the
knife
and
five
hundred
more
for
the
thief
what
a
idea
exclaimed
the
constable
the
thief
go
near
them
nor
send
anybody
whoever
goes
is
going
to
get
himself
nabbed
for
their
ai
any
pawnbroker
that
going
to
lose
the
chance
to
if
anybody
had
noticed
tom
face
at
that
time
the
color
of
it
might
have
provoked
curiosity
but
nobody
did
he
said
to
himself
i
gone
i
never
can
square
up
the
rest
of
the
plunder
wo
pawn
or
sell
for
half
of
the
bill
oh
i
know
it
i
gone
i
gone
and
this
time
it
for
good
oh
this
is
awful
i
do
know
what
to
do
nor
which
way
to
turn
softly
softly
said
wilson
to
blake
i
planned
their
scheme
for
them
at
midnight
last
night
and
it
was
all
finished
up
shipshape
by
two
this
morning
they
get
their
dagger
back
and
then
i
explain
to
you
how
the
thing
was
done
there
were
strong
signs
of
a
general
curiosity
and
buckstone
said
well
you
have
whetted
us
up
pretty
sharp
wilson
and
i
free
to
say
that
if
you
do
mind
telling
us
in
confidence
oh
i
as
soon
tell
as
not
buckstone
but
as
long
as
the
twins
and
i
agreed
to
say
nothing
about
it
we
must
let
it
stand
so
but
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
you
wo
be
kept
waiting
three
days
somebody
will
apply
for
that
reward
pretty
promptly
and
i
show
you
the
thief
and
the
dagger
both
very
soon
afterward
the
constable
was
disappointed
and
also
perplexed
he
said
it
may
all
be
yes
and
i
hope
it
will
but
i
blamed
if
i
can
see
my
way
through
it
it
too
many
for
yours
truly
the
subject
seemed
about
talked
out
nobody
seemed
to
have
anything
further
to
offer
after
a
silence
the
justice
of
the
peace
informed
wilson
that
he
and
buckstone
and
the
constable
had
come
as
a
committee
on
the
part
of
the
democratic
party
to
ask
him
to
run
for
mayor
for
the
little
town
was
about
to
become
a
city
and
the
first
charter
election
was
approaching
it
was
the
first
attention
which
wilson
had
ever
received
at
the
hands
of
any
party
it
was
a
sufficiently
humble
one
but
it
was
a
recognition
of
his
début
into
the
town
life
and
activities
at
last
it
was
a
step
upward
and
he
was
deeply
gratified
he
accepted
and
the
committee
departed
followed
by
young
tom
chapter

roxana
insists
upon
reform
the
true
southern
watermelon
is
a
boon
apart
and
not
to
be
mentioned
with
commoner
things
it
is
chief
of
this
world
luxuries
king
by
the
grace
of
god
over
all
the
fruits
of
the

when
one
has
tasted
it
he
knows
what
the
angels
eat
it
was
not
a
southern
watermelon
that
eve
took
we
know
it
because
she
wilson
calendar
about
the
time
that
wilson
was
bowing
the
committee
out
pembroke
howard
was
entering
the
next
house
to
report
he
found
the
old
judge
sitting
grim
and
straight
in
his
chair
waiting
well
howard
the
news
the
best
in
the
world
accepts
does
he
and
the
light
of
battle
gleamed
joyously
in
the
judge
eye
accepts
why
he
jumped
at
it
did
did
he
now
that
fine
that
very
fine
i
like
that
when
is
it
to
be
now
straight
off
an
admirable
fellow
admirable
admirable
he
a
darling
why
it
an
honor
as
well
as
a
pleasure
to
stand
up
before
such
a
man
come
off
with
you
go
and
arrange
everything
and
give
him
my
heartiest
compliments
a
rare
fellow
indeed
an
admirable
fellow
as
you
have
said
howard
hurried
away
saying
i
have
him
in
the
vacant
stretch
between
wilson
and
the
haunted
house
within
the
hour
and
i
bring
my
own
pistols
judge
driscoll
began
to
walk
the
floor
in
a
state
of
pleased
excitement
but
presently
he
stopped
and
began
to
think
began
to
think
of
tom
twice
he
moved
toward
the
secretary
and
twice
he
turned
away
again
but
finally
he
said
this
may
be
my
last
night
in
the
world
i
must
not
take
the
chance
he
is
worthless
and
unworthy
but
it
is
largely
my
fault
he
was
intrusted
to
me
by
my
brother
on
his
dying
bed
and
i
have
indulged
him
to
his
hurt
instead
of
training
him
up
severely
and
making
a
man
of
him
i
have
violated
my
trust
and
i
must
not
add
the
sin
of
desertion
to
that
i
have
forgiven
him
once
already
and
would
subject
him
to
a
long
and
hard
trial
before
forgiving
him
again
if
i
could
live
but
i
must
not
run
that
risk
no
i
must
restore
the
will
but
if
i
survive
the
duel
i
will
hide
it
away
and
he
will
not
know
and
i
will
not
tell
him
until
he
reforms
and
i
see
that
his
reformation
is
going
to
be
permanent
he
the
will
and
his
ostensible
nephew
was
heir
to
a
fortune
again
as
he
was
finishing
his
task
tom
wearied
with
another
brooding
tramp
entered
the
house
and
went
tiptoeing
past
the
door
he
glanced
in
and
hurried
on
for
the
sight
of
his
uncle
had
nothing
but
terrors
for
him
but
his
uncle
was
writing
that
was
unusual
at
this
late
hour
what
could
he
be
writing
a
chill
of
anxiety
settled
down
upon
tom
heart
did
that
writing
concern
him
he
was
afraid
so
he
reflected
that
when
ill
luck
begins
it
does
not
come
in
sprinkles
but
in
showers
he
said
he
would
get
a
glimpse
of
that
document
or
know
the
reason
why
he
heard
some
one
coming
and
stepped
out
of
sight
and
hearing
it
was
pembroke
howard
what
could
be
hatching
howard
said
with
great
satisfaction
everything
right
and
ready
he
gone
to
the
with
his
second
and
the
surgeon
also
with
his
brother
i
arranged
it
all
with
wilson

his
second
we
are
to
have
three

and

the
old

hearty
shake

said

i
knew
you
would
do
it
you
could
leave
that
poor
chap
to
fight
along
without
means
or

with
certain
defeat
before
him
and
i
knew
you
would
for
his
father
sake

not
for
his
own
for
his
dead

is
not
to
know
of
this
unless
i
fall
i
understand
i
keep
the
secret
the
judge
put
the
will
away
and
the
two
started
for
the
in
another
minute
the
will
was
in
tom
hands
his
misery
vanished
his
feelings
underwent
a
tremendous
revulsion
he
put
the
will
carefully
back
in
its
place
and
spread
his
mouth
and
swung
his
hat
once
twice
three
times
around
his
head
in
imitation
of
three
rousing
huzzas
no
sound
issuing
from
his
lips
he
fell
to
communing
with
himself
excitedly
and
joyously
but
every
now
and
then
he
let
off
another
volley
of
dumb
hurrahs
he
said
to
himself
i
got
the
fortune
again
but
i
not
let
on
that
i
know
about
it
and
this
time
i
going
to
hang
on
to
it
i
take
no
more
risks
i
gamble
no
more
i
drink
no
more
because
well
because
i
not
go
where
there
is
any
of
that
sort
of
thing
going
on
again
it
the
sure
way
and
the
only
sure
way
i
might
have
thought
of
that
sooner
well
yes
if
i
had
wanted
to
but
now
dear
me
i
had
a
scare
this
time
and
i
take
no
more
chances
not
a
single
chance
more
land
i
persuaded
myself
this
evening
that
i
could
fetch
him
around
without
any
great
amount
of
effort
but
i
been
getting
more
and
more
and
doubtful
straight
along
ever
since
if
he
tells
me
about
this
thing
all
right
but
if
he
does
i
let
on
i
well
i
like
to
tell
wilson
but
no
i
think
about
that
perhaps
i
wo
he
whirled
off
another
dead
huzza
and
said
i
reformed
and
this
time
i
stay
so
sure
he
was
about
to
close
with
a
final
grand
silent
demonstration
when
he
suddenly
recollected
that
wilson
had
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
pawn
or
sell
the
indian
knife
and
that
he
was
once
more
in
awful
peril
of
exposure
by
his
creditors
for
that
reason
his
joy
collapsed
utterly
and
he
turned
away
and
moped
toward
the
door
moaning
and
lamenting
over
the
bitterness
of
his
luck
he
dragged
himself
and
brooded
in
his
room
a
long
time
disconsolate
and
forlorn
with
luigi
indian
knife
for
a
text
at
last
he
sighed
and
said
when
i
supposed
these
stones
were
glass
and
this
ivory
bone
the
thing
had
any
interest
for
me
because
it
had
any
value
and
help
me
out
of
my
trouble
but
now
why
now
it
is
full
of
interest
yes
and
of
a
sort
to
break
a
body
heart
it
a
bag
of
gold
that
has
turned
to
dirt
and
ashes
in
my
hands
it
could
save
me
and
save
me
so
easily
and
yet
i
got
to
go
to
ruin
it
like
drowning
with
a
in
my
reach
all
the
hard
luck
comes
to
me
and
all
the
good
luck
goes
to
other
people
wilson
for
instance
even
his
career
has
got
a
sort
of
a
little
start
at
last
and
what
has
he
done
to
deserve
it
i
should
like
to
know
yes
he
has
opened
his
own
road
but
he
is
content
with
that
but
must
block
mine
it
a
sordid
selfish
world
and
i
wish
i
was
out
of
it
he
allowed
the
light
of
the
candle
to
play
upon
the
jewels
of
the
sheath
but
the
flashings
and
sparklings
had
no
charm
for
his
eye
they
were
only
just
so
many
pangs
to
his
heart
i
must
not
say
anything
to
roxy
about
this
thing
he
said
she
is
too
daring
she
would
be
for
digging
these
stones
out
and
selling
them
and
then
why
she
would
be
arrested
and
the
stones
traced
and
then
the
thought
made
him
quake
and
he
hid
the
knife
away
trembling
all
over
and
glancing
furtively
about
like
a
criminal
who
fancies
that
the
accuser
is
already
at
hand
should
he
try
to
sleep
oh
no
sleep
was
not
for
him
his
trouble
was
too
haunting
too
afflicting
for
that
he
must
have
somebody
to
mourn
with
he
would
carry
his
despair
to
roxy
he
had
heard
several
distant
gunshots
but
that
sort
of
thing
was
not
uncommon
and
they
had
made
no
impression
upon
him
he
went
out
at
the
back
door
and
turned
westward
he
passed
wilson
house
and
proceeded
along
the
lane
and
presently
saw
several
figures
approaching
place
through
the
vacant
lots
these
were
the
duelists
returning
from
the
fight
he
thought
he
recognized
them
but
as
he
had
no
desire
for
white
people
company
he
stooped
down
behind
the
fence
until
they
were
out
of
his
way
roxy
was
feeling
fine
she
said
whah
was
you
child
war
you
in
it
in
what
in
de
duel
duel
has
there
been
a
duel
dey
has
de
ole
jedge
has
havin
a
duel
wid
one
o
dem
twins
great
scott
then
he
added
to
himself
that
what
made
him
the
will
he
thought
he
might
get
killed
and
it
softened
him
toward
me
and
that
what
he
and
howard
were
so
busy
about
oh
dear
if
the
twin
had
only
killed
him
i
should
be
out
of
my
what
is
you
mumblin
bout
chambers
whah
was
you
did
you
know
dey
was
gwyne
to
be
a
duel
no
i
did
the
old
man
tried
to
get
me
to
fight
one
with
count
luigi
but
he
did
succeed
so
i
reckon
he
concluded
to
patch
up
the
family
honor
himself
he
laughed
at
the
idea
and
went
rambling
on
with
a
detailed
account
of
his
talk
with
the
judge
and
how
shocked
and
ashamed
the
judge
was
to
find
that
he
had
a
coward
in
his
family
he
glanced
up
at
last
and
got
a
shock
himself
roxana
bosom
was
heaving
with
suppressed
passion
and
she
was
glowering
down
upon
him
with
measureless
contempt
written
in
her
face
en
you
refuse
to
fight
a
man
dat
kicked
you
o
jumpin
at
de

en
you

you

birth
what
would
yo
pa
think
you
it
enough
to
make
him
turn
in
his
grave
the
last
three
sentences
stung
tom
into
a
fury
and
he
said
to
himself
that
if
his
father
were
only
alive
and
in
reach
of
assassination
his
mother
would
soon
find
that
he
had
a
very
clear
notion
of
the
size
of
his
indebtedness
to
that
man
and
was
willing
to
pay
it
up
in
full
and
would
do
it
too
even
at
risk
of
his
life
but
he
kept
this
thought
to
himself
that
was
safest
in
his
mother
present
state
whatever
has
come
o
yo

yes
it
de
nigger
in
you
she
sat
down
on
her
and
fell
into
a
reverie
tom
did
not
disturb
her
he
sometimes
lacked
prudence
but
it
was
not
in
circumstances
of
this
kind
roxana
storm
went
gradually
down
but
it
died
hard
and
even
when
it
seemed
to
be
quite
gone
it
would
now
and
then
break
out
in
a
distant
rumble
so
to
speak
in
the
form
of
muttered
ejaculations
one
of
these
was
ai
nigger
enough
in
him
to
show
in
his
en
dat
takes
mighty
little
yit
dey
enough
to
paint
his
soul
presently
she
muttered
yassir
enough
to
paint
a
whole
thimbleful
of
at
last
her
ramblings
ceased
altogether
and
her
countenance
began
to
clear
a
welcome
sign
to
tom
who
had
learned
her
moods
and
knew
she
was
on
the
threshold
of
now
he
noticed
that
from
time
to
time
she
unconsciously
carried
her
finger
to
the
end
of
her
nose
he
looked
closer
and
said
why
mammy
the
end
of
your
nose
is
skinned
how
did
that
come
she
sent
out
the
sort
of
peal
of
laughter
which
god
had
vouchsafed
in
its
perfection
to
none
but
the
happy
angels
in
heaven
and
the
bruised
and
broken
black
slave
on
the
earth
and
said
dad

oh

dear

live
to
find
me
out
and
sell
me

some
yet
yes
and
he
would
do

in
a
minute
then
he
said
aloud
in
a
grave
tone
mother
we
are
in
an
awful
fix
roxana
caught
her
breath
with
a
spasm
and

white
and

thought

might
get
killed

a
chance
to
forgive
me
any
more
in

night
duel
between
chief
citizen
and
titled
stranger
the
people
took
more
pride
in
the
duel
than
in
all
the
other
events
put
together
perhaps
it
was
a
glory
to
their
town
to
have
such
a
thing
happen
there
in
their
eyes
the
principals
had
reached
the
summit
of
human
honor
everybody
paid
homage
to
their
names
their
praises
were
in
all
mouths
even
the
duelists
subordinates
came
in
for
a
handsome
share
of
the
public
approbation
wherefore
wilson
was
suddenly
become
a
man
of
consequence
when
asked
to
run
for
the
mayoralty
saturday
night
he
was
risking
defeat
but
sunday
morning
found
him
a
made
man
and
his
success
assured
the
twins
were
prodigiously
great
now
the
town
took
them
to
its
bosom
with
enthusiasm
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
they
went
dining
and
visiting
from
house
to
house
making
friends
enlarging
and
solidifying
their
popularity
and
charming
and
surprising
all
with
their
musical
prodigies
and
now
and
then
heightening
the
effects
with
samples
of
what
they
could
do
in
other
directions
out
of
their
stock
of
rare
and
curious
accomplishments
they
were
so
pleased
that
they
gave
the
regulation
thirty
days
notice
the
required
preparation
for
citizenship
and
resolved
to
finish
their
days
in
this
pleasant
place
that
was
the
climax
the
delighted
community
rose
as
one
man
and
applauded
and
when
the
twins
were
asked
to
stand
for
seats
in
the
forthcoming
aldermanic
board
and
consented
the
public
contentment
was
rounded
and
complete
tom
driscoll
was
not
happy
over
these
things
they
sunk
deep
and
hurt
all
the
way
down
he
hated
the
one
twin
for
kicking
him
and
the
other
one
for
being
the
kicker
brother
now
and
then
the
people
wondered
why
nothing
was
heard
of
the
raider
or
of
the
stolen
knife
or
the
other
plunder
but
nobody
was
able
to
throw
any
light
on
that
matter
nearly
a
week
had
drifted
by
and
still
the
thing
remained
a
vexed
mystery
on
saturday
constable
blake
and
wilson
met
on
the
street
and
tom
driscoll
joined
them
in
time
to
open
their
conversation
for
them
he
said
to
blake
you
are
not
looking
well
blake
you
seem
to
be
annoyed
about
something
has
anything
gone
wrong
in
the
detective
business
i
believe
you
fairly
and
justifiably
claim
to
have
a
pretty
good
reputation
in
that
line
is
it
so
which
made
blake
feel
good
and
look
it
but
tom
added
for
a
country
detective
which
made
blake
feel
the
other
way
and
not
only
look
it
but
betray
it
in
his
voice
yes
sir
i
have
got
a
reputation
and
it
as
good
as
anybody
in
the
profession
too
country
or
no
country
oh
i
beg
pardon
i
did
mean
any
offense
what
i
started
out
to
ask
was
only
about
the
old
woman
that
raided
the
town
the
old
woman
you
know
that
you
said
you
were
going
to
catch
and
i
knew
you
would
too
because
you
have
the
reputation
of
never
boasting
and
well
you
you
caught
the
old
woman
d
the
old
woman
why
sho
you
do
mean
to
say
you
have
caught
her
no
i
have
caught
her
if
anybody
could
have
caught
her
i
could
but
nobody
could
i
do
care
who
he
is
i
am
sorry
real
sorry
for
your
sake
because
when
it
gets
around
that
a
detective
has
expressed
himself
so
confidently
and
then
do
you
worry
that
all
do
you
worry
and
as
for
the
town
the
town
need
worry
either
she
my
meat
make
yourself
easy
about
that
i
on
her
track
i
got
clues
that
that
good
now
if
you
could
get
an
old
veteran
detective
down
from
louis
to
help
you
find
out
what
the
clues
mean
and
where
they
lead
to
and
then
i
plenty
veteran
enough
myself
and
i
do
need
anybody
help
have
her
inside
of
a
we
inside
of
a
month
that
i
swear
to
tom
said
carelessly
i
suppose
that
will
answer
yes
that
will
answer
but
i
reckon
she
is
pretty
old
and
old
people
do
often
outlive
the
cautious
pace
of
the
professional
detective
when
he
has
got
his
clues
together
and
is
out
on
his
blake
dull
face
flushed
under
this
gibe
but
before
he
could
set
his
retort
in
order
tom
had
turned
to
wilson
and
was
saying
with
placid
indifference
of
manner
and
voice
who
got
the
reward
wilson
winced
slightly
and
saw
that
his
own
turn
was
come
what
reward
why
the
reward
for
the
thief
and
the
other
one
for
the
knife
wilson
answered
and
rather
uncomfortably
to
judge
by
his
hesitating
fashion
of
delivering
himself
well
the
well
in
fact
nobody
has
claimed
it
yet
tom
seemed
surprised
why
is
that
so
wilson
showed
a
trifle
of
irritation
when
he
replied
yes
it
so
and
what
of
it
oh
nothing
only
i
thought
you
had
struck
out
a
new
idea
and
invented
a
scheme
that
was
going
to
revolutionize
the
and
ineffectual
methods
of
the
he
stopped
and
turned
to
blake
who
was
happy
now
that
another
had
taken
his
place
on
the
gridiron
blake
did
you
understand
him
to
intimate
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
you
to
hunt
the
old
woman
down
he
said
he
have
thief
and
swag
both
inside
of
three
days
he
did
by
hokey
and
that
just
about
a
week
ago
why
i
said
at
the
time
that
no
thief
and
no
thief
pal
was
going
to
try
to
pawn
or
sell
a
thing
where
he
knowed
the
pawnbroker
could
get
both
rewards
by
taking
him
into
camp
with
the
swag
it
was
the
blessedest
idea
that
ever
i
struck
you
change
your
mind
said
wilson
with
irritated
bluntness
if
you
knew
the
entire
scheme
instead
of
only
part
of
it
well
said
the
constable
pensively
i
had
the
idea
that
it
work
and
up
to
now
i
right
anyway
very
well
then
let
it
stand
at
that
and
give
it
a
further
show
it
has
worked
at
least
as
well
as
your
own
methods
you
perceive
the
constable
had
anything
handy
to
hit
back
with
so
he
discharged
a
discontented
sniff
and
said
nothing
after
the
night
that
wilson
had
partly
revealed
his
scheme
at
his
house
tom
had
tried
for
several
days
to
guess
out
the
secret
of
the
rest
of
it
but
had
failed
then
it
occurred
to
him
to
give
roxana
smarter
head
a
chance
at
it
he
made
up
a
supposititious
case
and
laid
it
before
her
she
thought
it
over
and
delivered
her
verdict
upon
it
tom
said
to
himself
she
hit
it
sure
he
thought
he
would
test
that
verdict
now
and
watch
wilson
face
so
he
said
reflectively
wilson
you
not
a
fool
a
fact
of
recent
discovery
whatever
your
scheme
was
it
had
sense
in
it
blake
opinion
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
i
do
ask
you
to
reveal
it
but
i
will
suppose
a
case
a
case
which
will
answer
as
a
for
the
real
thing
i
am
going
to
come
at
and
that
all
i
want
you
offered
five
hundred
dollars
for
the
knife
and
five
hundred
for
the
thief
we
will
suppose
for
argument
sake
that
the
first
reward
is
advertised
and
the
second
offered
by
private
letter
to
pawnbrokers
and
blake
slapped
his
thigh
and
cried
out
by
jackson
he
got
you
now
why
could
i
or
any
fool
have
thought
of
that
wilson
said
to
himself
anybody
with
a
reasonably
good
head
would
have
thought
of
it
i
am
not
surprised
that
blake
did
detect
it
i
am
only
surprised
that
tom
did
there
is
more
to
him
than
i
supposed
he
said
nothing
aloud
and
tom
went
on
very
well
the
thief
would
not
suspect
that
there
was
a
trap
and
he
would
bring
or
send
the
knife
and
say
he
bought
it
for
a
song
or
found
it
in
the
road
or
something
like
that
and
try
to
collect
the
reward
and
be
arrested
would
he
yes
said
wilson
i
think
so
said
tom
there
ca
be
any
doubt
of
it
have
you
ever
seen
that
knife
no
has
any
friend
of
yours
not
that
i
know
of
well
i
begin
to
think
i
understand
why
your
scheme
failed
what
do
you
mean
tom
what
are
you
driving
at
asked
wilson
with
a
dawning
sense
of
discomfort
why
that
there
is
any
such
knife
look
here
wilson
said
blake
tom
driscoll
right
for
a
thousand
dollars
if
i
had
it
wilson
blood
warmed
a
little
and
he
wondered
if
he
had
been
played
upon
by
those
strangers
it
certainly
had
something
of
that
look
but
what
could
they
gain
by
it
he
threw
out
that
suggestion
tom
replied
gain
oh
nothing
that
you
would
value
maybe
but
they
are
strangers
making
their
way
in
a
new
community
is
it
nothing
to
them
to
appear
as
pets
of
an
oriental
prince
at
no
expense
is
it
nothing
to
them
to
be
able
to
dazzle
this
poor
little
town
with
rewards
at
no
expense
wilson
there
is
any
such
knife
or
your
scheme
would
have
fetched
it
to
light
or
if
there
is
any
such
knife
they
got
it
yet
i
believe
myself
that
they
seen
such
a
knife
for
angelo
pictured
it
out
with
his
pencil
too
swiftly
and
handily
for
him
to
have
been
inventing
it
and
of
course
i
ca
swear
that
they
never
had
it
but
this
i
go
bail
for
if
they
had
it
when
they
came
to
this
town
they
got
it
yet
blake
said
it
looks
mighty
reasonable
the
way
tom
puts
it
it
most
certainly
does
tom
responded
turning
to
leave
you
find
the
old
woman
blake
and
if
she
ca
furnish
the
knife
go
and
search
the
twins
tom
sauntered
away
wilson
felt
a
good
deal
depressed
he
hardly
knew
what
to
think
he
was
loath
to
withdraw
his
faith
from
the
twins
and
was
resolved
not
to
do
it
on
the
present
indecisive
evidence
but
well
he
would
think
and
then
decide
how
to
act
blake
what
do
you
think
of
this
matter
well
i
bound
to
say
i
put
it
up
the
way
tom
does
they
had
the
knife
or
if
they
had
it
they
got
it
yet
the
men
parted
wilson
said
to
himself
i
believe
they
had
it
if
it
had
been
stolen
the
scheme
would
have
restored
it
that
is
certain
and
so
i
believe
they
got
it
yet
tom
had
no
purpose
in
his
mind
when
he
encountered
those
two
men
when
he
began
his
talk
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
gall
them
a
little
and
get
a
trifle
of
malicious
entertainment
out
of
it
but
when
he
left
he
left
in
great
spirits
for
he
perceived
that
just
by
pure
luck
and
no
troublesome
labor
he
had
accomplished
several
delightful
things
he
had
touched
both
men
on
a
raw
spot
and
seen
them
squirm
he
had
modified
wilson
sweetness
for
the
twins
with
one
small
bitter
taste
that
he
would
be
able
to
get
out
of
his
mouth
right
away
and
best
of
all
he
had
taken
the
hated
twins
down
a
peg
with
the
community
for
blake
would
gossip
around
freely
after
the
manner
of
detectives
and
within
a
week
the
town
would
be
laughing
at
them
in
its
sleeve
for
offering
a
gaudy
reward
for
a
bauble
which
they
either
never
possessed
or
lost
tom
was
very
well
satisfied
with
himself
tom
behavior
at
home
had
been
perfect
during
the
entire
week
his
uncle
and
aunt
had
seen
nothing
like
it
before
they
could
find
no
fault
with
him
anywhere
saturday
evening
he
said
to
the
judge
i
had
something
preying
on
my
mind
uncle
and
as
i
am
going
away
and
might
never
see
you
again
i
ca
bear
it
any
longer
i
made
you
believe
i
was
afraid
to
fight
that
italian
adventurer
i
had
to
get
out
of
it
on
some
pretext
or
other
and
maybe
i
chose
badly
being
taken
unawares
but
no
honorable
person
could
consent
to
meet
him
in
the
field
knowing
what
i
knew
about
him
indeed
what
was
that
count
luigi
is
a
confessed
assassin
incredible
it
perfectly
true
wilson
detected
it
in
his
hand
by
palmistry
and
charged
him
with
it
and
cornered
him
up
so
close
that
he
had
to
confess
but
both
twins
begged
us
on
their
knees
to
keep
the
secret
and
swore
they
would
lead
straight
lives
here
and
it
was
all
so
pitiful
that
we
gave
our
word
of
honor
never
to
expose
them
while
they
kept
that
promise
you
would
have
done
it
yourself
uncle
you
are
right
my
boy
i
would
a
man
secret
is
still
his
own
property
and
sacred
when
it
has
been
surprised
out
of
him
like
that
you
did
well
and
i
am
proud
of
you
then
he
added
mournfully
but
i
wish
i
could
have
been
saved
the
shame
of
meeting
an
assassin
on
the
field
of
honor
it
could
be
helped
uncle
if
i
had
known
you
were
going
to
challenge
him
i
should
have
felt
obliged
to
sacrifice
my
pledged
word
in
order
to
stop
it
but
wilson
could
be
expected
to
do
otherwise
than
keep
silent
oh
no
wilson
did
right
and
is
in
no
way
to
blame
tom
tom
you
have
lifted
a
heavy
load
from
my
heart
i
was
stung
to
the
very
soul
when
i
seemed
to
have
discovered
that
i
had
a
coward
in
my
family
you
may
imagine
what
it
cost
me
to
assume
such
a
part
uncle
oh
i
know
it
poor
boy
i
know
it
and
i
can
understand
how
much
it
has
cost
you
to
remain
under
that
unjust
stigma
to
this
time
but
it
is
all
right
now
and
no
harm
is
done
you
have
restored
my
comfort
of
mind
and
with
it
your
own
and
both
of
us
had
suffered
enough
the
old
man
sat
awhile
plunged
in
thought
then
he
looked
up
with
a
satisfied
light
in
his
eye
and
said
that
this
assassin
should
have
put
the
affront
upon
me
of
letting
me
meet
him
on
the
field
of
honor
as
if
he
were
a
gentleman
is
a
matter
which
i
will
presently
settle
but
not
now
i
will
not
shoot
him
until
after
election
i
see
a
way
to
ruin
them
both
before
i
will
attend
to
that
first
neither
of
them
shall
be
elected
that
i
promise
you
are
sure
that
the
fact
that
he
is
an
assassin
has
not
got
abroad
perfectly
certain
of
it
sir
it
will
be
a
good
card
i
will
fling
a
hint
at
it
from
the
stump
on
the
it
will
sweep
the
ground
from
under
both
of
them
there
not
a
doubt
of
it
it
will
finish
them
that
and
outside
work
among
the
voters
will
to
a
certainty
i
want
you
to
come
down
here
by
and
by
and
work
privately
among
the
and
bobtail
you
shall
spend
money
among
them
i
will
furnish
it
another
point
scored
against
the
detested
twins
really
it
was
a
great
day
for
tom
he
was
encouraged
to
chance
a
parting
shot
now
at
the
same
target
and
did
it
you
know
that
wonderful
indian
knife
that
the
twins
have
been
making
such
a
about
well
there
no
track
or
trace
of
it
yet
so
the
town
is
beginning
to
sneer
and
gossip
and
laugh
half
the
people
believe
they
never
had
any
such
knife
the
other
half
believe
they
had
it
and
have
got
it
still
i
heard
twenty
people
talking
like
that
yes
tom
blemishless
week
had
restored
him
to
the
favor
of
his
aunt
and
uncle
his
mother
was
satisfied
with
him
too
privately
she
believed
she
was
coming
to
love
him
but
she
did
not
say
so
she
told
him
to
go
along
to
louis
now
and
she
would
get
ready
and
follow
then
she
smashed
her
whisky
bottle
and
said
dah
now
i
to
make
you
walk
as
straight
as
a
string
chambers
en
so
i
bown
you
ai
gwyne
to
git
no
bad

went
aboard
one
of
the
big
transient
boats
that
night
with
his
heavy
satchel
of
miscellaneous
plunder
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
unjust
which
is
serener
and
sounder
than
the
other
kind
as
we
know
by
the
history
of
a

when
he
got
up

luck
was
against

if

this
is
the
principal
difference
between
a
dog
and
a
wilson
calendar
we
know
all
about
the
habits
of
the

we
know
all
about
the
habits
of
the

but
we
know
nothing
at
all
about
the
habits

the
oyster
it
seems
almost
certain
that
we
have
been
choosing
the
wrong
time
for
studying
the
wilson
calendar
when
roxana
arrived
she
found
her
son
in
such
despair
and
misery
that
her
heart
was
touched
and
her
motherhood
rose
up
strong
in
her
he
was
ruined
past
hope
now
his
destruction
would
be
immediate
and
sure
and
he
would
be
an
outcast
and
friendless
that
was
reason
enough
for
a
mother
to
love
a
child
so
she
loved
him
and
told
him
so
it
made
him
wince
secretly
for
she
was
a
nigger
that
he
was
one
himself
was
far
from
reconciling
him
to
that
despised
race
roxana
poured
out
endearments
upon
him
to
which
he
responded
uncomfortably
but
as
well
as
he
could
and
she
tried
to
comfort
him
but
that
was
not
possible
these
intimacies
quickly
became
horrible
to
him
and
within
the
hour
he
began
to
try
to
get
up
courage
enough
to
tell
her
so
and
require
that
they
be
discontinued
or
very
considerably
modified
but
he
was
afraid
of
her
and
besides
there
came
a
lull
now
for
she
had
begun
to
think
she
was
trying
to
invent
a
saving
plan
finally
she
started
up
and
said
she
had
found
a
way
out
tom
was
almost
suffocated

the
joy
of

if

bargain
tom
forged
a
bill
of
sale
and
sold
his
mother
to
an
arkansas
for
a
trifle
over
six
hundred
dollars
he
did
not
want
to
commit
this
treachery
but
luck
threw
the
man
in
his
way
and
this
saved
him
the
necessity
of
going
up
country
to
hunt
up
a
purchaser
with
the
added
risk
of
having
to
answer
a
lot
of
questions
whereas
this
planter
was
so
pleased
with
roxy
that
he
asked
next
to
none
at
all
besides
the
planter
insisted
that
roxy
would
know
where
she
was
at
first
and
that
by
the
time
she
found
out
she
would
already
have
become
contented
and
tom
argued
with
himself
that
it
was
an
immense
advantage
for
roxy
to
have
a
master
who
was
so
pleased
with
her
as
this
planter
manifestly
was
in
almost
no
time
his
flowing
reasonings
carried
him
to
the
point
of
even
half
believing
he
was
doing
roxy
a
splendid
surreptitious
service
in
selling
her
down
the
river
and
then
he
kept
diligently
saying
to
himself
all
the
time
it
for
only
a
year
in
a
year
i
buy
her
free
again
she
keep
that
in
mind
and
it
reconcile
her
yes
the
little
deception
could
do
no
harm
and
everything
would
come
out
right
and
pleasant
in
the
end
any
way
by
agreement
the
conversation
in
roxy
presence
was
all
about
the
man
upcountry
farm
and
how
pleasant
a
place
it
was
and
how
happy
the
slaves
were
there
so
poor
roxy
was
entirely
deceived
and
easily
for
she
was
not
dreaming
that
her
own
son
could
be
guilty
of
treason
to
a
mother
who
in
voluntarily
going
into
slavery
slavery
of
any
kind
mild
or
severe
or
of
any
duration
brief
or
long
was
making
a
sacrifice
for
him
compared
with
which
death
would
have
been
a
poor
and
commonplace
one
she
lavished
tears
and
loving
caresses
upon
him
privately
and
then
went
away
with
her
owner
went
away
and
yet
proud
of
what
she
was
doing
and
glad
it
was
in
her
power
to
do
it
tom
squared
his
accounts
and
resolved
to
keep
to
the
very
letter
of
his
reform
and
never
to
put
that
will
in
jeopardy
again
he
had
three
hundred
dollars
left
according
to
his
mother
plan
he
was
to
put
that
safely
away
and
add
her
half
of
his
pension
to
it
monthly
in
one
year
this
fund
would
buy
her
free
again
for
a
whole
week
he
was
not
able
to
sleep
well
so
much
the
villainy
which
he
had
played
upon
his
trusting
mother
preyed
upon
his
rag
of
a
conscience
but
after
that
he
began
to
get
comfortable
again
and
was
presently
able
to
sleep
like
any
other
miscreant
the
boat
bore
roxy
away
from
louis
at
four
in
the
afternoon
and
she
stood
on
the
lower
guard
abaft
the
and
watched
tom
through
a
blur
of
tears
until
he
melted
into
the
throng
of
people
and
disappeared
then
she
looked
no
more
but
sat
there
on
a
coil
of
cable
crying
till
far
into
the
night
when
she
went
to
her
foul
at
last
between
the
clashing
engines
it
was
not
to
sleep
but
only
to
wait
for
the
morning
and
waiting
grieve
it
had
been
imagined
that
she
would
not
know
and
would
think
she
was
traveling
up
stream
she
why
she
had
been
steamboating
for
years
at
dawn
she
got
up
and
went
listlessly
and
sat
down
on
the
again
she
passed
many
a
snag
whose
break
could
have
told
her
a
thing
to
break
her
heart
for
it
showed
a
current
moving
in
the
same
direction
that
the
boat
was
going
but
her
thoughts
were
elsewhere
and
she
did
not
notice
but
at
last
the
roar
of
a
bigger
and
nearer
break
than
usual
brought
her
out
of
her
torpor
and
she
looked
up
and
her
practised
eye
fell
upon
that
telltale
rush
of
water
for
one
moment
her
petrified
gaze
fixed
itself
there
then
her
head
dropped
upon
her
breast
and
she
said
oh

have
mercy
on

the
summer
weeks
dragged
by
and
then
the
political
campaign
opened
opened
in
pretty
warm
fashion
and
waxed
hotter
and
hotter
daily
the
twins
threw
themselves
into
it
with
their
whole
heart
for
their
was
engaged
their
popularity
so
general
at
first
had
suffered
afterward
mainly
because
they
had
been
too
popular
and
so
a
natural
reaction
had
followed
besides
it
had
been
diligently
whispered
around
that
it
was
curious
indeed
very
curious
that
that
wonderful
knife
of
theirs
did
not
turn
up
if
it
was
so
valuable
or
if
it
had
ever
existed
and
with
the
whisperings
went
chucklings
and
nudgings
and
winks
and
such
things
have
an
effect
the
twins
considered
that
success
in
the
election
would
reinstate
them
and
that
defeat
would
work
them
irreparable
damage
therefore
they
worked
hard
but
not
harder
than
judge
driscoll
and
tom
worked
against
them
in
the
closing
days
of
the
canvas
tom
conduct
had
remained
so
during
two
whole
months
now
that
his
uncle
not
only
trusted
him
with
money
with
which
to
persuade
voters
but
trusted
him
to
go
and
get
it
himself
out
of
the
safe
in
the
private
the
closing
speech
of
the
campaign
was
made
by
judge
driscoll
and
he
made
it
against
both
of
the
foreigners
it
was
disastrously
effective
he
poured
out
rivers
of
ridicule
upon
them
and
forced
the
big
to
laugh
and
applaud
he
scoffed
at
them
as
adventurers
mountebanks

freaks
he
assailed
their
showy
titles
with
measureless
derision
he
said
they
were
barbers
disguised
as
nobilities
peanut

masquerading
as
gentlemen
bereft
of
their
brother
monkey
at
last
he
stopped
and
stood
still
he
waited
until
the
place
had
become
absolutely
silent
and
expectant
then
he
delivered
his
deadliest
shot
delivered
it
with
seriousness
and
deliberation
with
a
significant
emphasis
upon
the
closing
words
he
said
that
he
believed
that
the
reward
offered
for
the
lost
knife
was
humbug
and
buncombe
and
that
its
owner
would
know
where
to
find
it
whenever
he
should
have
occasion
to
assassinate
somebody
then
he
stepped
from
the
stand
leaving
a
startled
and
impressive
hush
behind
him
instead
of
the
customary
explosion
of
cheers
and
party
cries
the
strange
remark
flew
far
and
wide
over
the
town
and
made
an
extraordinary
sensation
everybody
was
asking
what
could
he
mean
by
that
and
everybody
went
on
asking
that
question
but
in
vain
for

only
said
he
knew
what
he
was
talking
about

stopped

the
friday
after
the

was
a
rainy
one
in
louis
it
rained
all
day
long
and
rained
hard
apparently
trying
its
best
to
wash
that
town
white
but
of
course
not
succeeding
toward
midnight
tom
driscoll
arrived
at
his
lodgings
from
the
theatre
in
the
heavy
downpour
and
closed
his
umbrella
and
let
himself
in
but
when
he
would
have
shut
the
door
he
found
that
there
was
another
person
entering
doubtless
another
lodger
this
person
closed
the
door
and
tramped
behind
tom
tom
found
his
door
in
the
dark
and
entered
it
and
turned
up
the
gas
when
he
faced
about
lightly
whistling
he
saw
the
back
of
a
man
the
man
was
closing
and
locking
his
door
for
him
his
whistle
faded
out
and
he
felt
uneasy
the
man
turned
around
a
wreck
of
shabby
old
clothes
sodden
with
rain
and
all
and
showed
a
black
face
under
an
old
slouch
hat
tom
was
frightened
he
tried
to
order
the
man
out
but
the
words
refused
to
come
and
the
other
man
got
the
start
he
said
in
a
low
voice
keep
still
i
yo
mother
tom
sunk
in
a
heap
on
a
chair
and
gasped
out
it
was
mean
of
me
and
base
i
know
it
but
i
meant
it
for
the
best
i
did
indeed
i
can
swear
it
roxana
stood
awhile
looking
mutely
down
on
him
while
he
writhed
in
shame
and
went
on
incoherently
babbling
mixed
with
pitiful
attempts
at
explanation
and
palliation
of
his
crime
then
she
seated
herself
and
took
off
her
hat
and
her
unkept
masses
of
long
brown
hair
tumbled
down
about
her
shoulders
it
ai
no

she
said
sadly
noticing
the
hair
i
know
it
i
know
it
i
a
scoundrel
but
i
swear
i
meant
it
for
the
best
it
was
a
mistake
of
course
but
i
thought
it
was
for
the
best
i
truly
did
roxana
began
to
cry
softly
and
presently
words
began
to
find
their
way
out
between
her
sobs
they
were
uttered
lamentingly
rather
than
angrily

these
words
should
have
touched
tom
driscoll
but
if
they
did
that
effect
was
obliterated
by
a
stronger
one
one
which
removed
the
heavy
weight
of
fear
which
lay
upon
him
and
gave
his
crushed
spirit
a
most
grateful
rebound
and
filled
all
his
small
soul
with
a
deep
sense
of
relief
but
he
kept
prudently
still
and
ventured
no
comment
there
was
a
voiceless
interval
of
some
duration
now
in
which
no
sounds
were
heard
but
the
beating
of
the
rain
upon
the
panes
the
sighing
and
complaining
of
the
winds
and
now
and
then
a
muffled
sob
from
roxana
the
sobs
became
more
and
more
infrequent
and
at
last
ceased
then
the
refugee
began
to
talk
again

against
the
planter
wife
and
he
said
to
himself
but
for
that
meddlesome
fool
everything
would
have
gone
all
right
he
added
a
deep
and
bitter
curse
against
her
the
expression
of
this
sentiment
was
fiercely
written
in
his
face
and
stood
thus
revealed
to
roxana
by
a
white
glare
of
lightning
which
turned
the
somber
dusk
of
the
room
into
dazzling
day
at
that
moment
she
was
pleased
pleased
and
grateful
for
did
not
that
expression
show
that
her
child
was
capable
of
grieving
for
his
mother
wrongs
and
of
feeling
resentment
toward
her
persecutors
a
thing
which
she
had
been
doubting
but
her
flash
of
happiness
was
only
a
flash
and
went
out
again
and
left
her
spirit
dark
for
she
said
to
herself
he
sole
me
down
de
river
he
ca
feel
for
a
body
long

to

de
man
en
givin
him
some
bills
i
reckon
en
de
nigger
he
offerin
a
reward
dat
it
ai
i
right
do
you
reckon
tom
had
been
gradually
sinking
into
a
state
of
ghastly
terror
and
he
said
to
himself
now
i
lost
no
matter
what
turn
things
take
this
man
has
said
to
me
that
he
thinks
there
was
something
suspicious
about
that
sale
he
said
he
had
a
letter
from
a
passenger
on
the
grand
mogul
saying
that
roxy
came
here
on
that
boat
and
that
everybody
on
board
knew
all
about
the
case
so
he
says
that
her
coming
here
instead
of
flying
to
a
free
state
looks
bad
for
me
and
that
if
i
do
find
her
for
him
and
that
pretty
soon
he
will
make
trouble
for
me
i
never
believed
that
story
i
could
believe
she
would
be
so
dead
to
all
motherly
instincts
as
to
come
here
knowing
the
risk
she
would
run
of
getting
me
into
irremediable
trouble
and
after
all
here
she
is
and
i
stupidly
swore
i
would
help
him
find
her
thinking
it
was
a
perfectly
safe
thing
to
promise
if
i
venture
to
deliver
her
up
she
she
but
how
can
i
help
myself
i
got
to
do
that
or
pay
the
money
and
where
the
money
to
come
from
i
i
well
i
should
think
that
if
he
would
swear
to
treat
her
kindly
hereafter
and
she
says
herself
that
he
is
a
good
man
and
if
he
would
swear
to
never
allow
her
to
be
overworked
or
ill
fed
or
a
flash
of
lightning
exposed
tom
pallid
face
drawn
and
rigid
with
these
worrying
thoughts
roxana
spoke
up
sharply
now
and
there
was
apprehension
in
her
voice
turn

light

to
me
she
was
panting
with
excitement
and
there
was
a
dusky
glow
in
her
eyes
that
tom
could
not
translate
with
certainty
but
there
seemed
to
be
something
threatening
about
it
the
handbill
had
the
usual
rude
woodcut
of
a
turbaned
negro
woman
running
with
the
customary
bundle
on
a
stick
over
her
shoulder
and
the
heading
in
bold
type

tom
read
the
bill
aloud
at
least
the
part
that
described
roxana
and
named
the
master
and
his
louis
address
and
the
address
of
the
agency
but
he
left
out

item

had
folded

chilly
streak
creeping
down
his
back

carelessly
as

tom
rose
trembling
and
excited
and
there
was
an
evil
light
in
his
eye
he
strode
to
the
door
and
said
he
must
get
out
of
this
suffocating
place
for
a
moment
and
clear
his
brain
in
the
fresh
air
so

they

tom
trembled
every
time
a
late
straggler
brushed
by
them
on
the
street
and
half
expected
to
feel
the
cold
steel
in
his
back
roxy
was
right
at
his
heels
and
always
in
reach
after
tramping
a
mile
they
reached
a
wide
vacancy
on
the
deserted
wharves
and
in
this
dark
and
rainy
desert
they
parted
as
tom
trudged
home
his
mind
was
full
of
dreary
thoughts
and
wild
plans
but
at
last
he
said
to
himself
wearily
there
is
but
the
one
way

i
must
follow
her
plan
but
with
a
variation
i
will
not
ask
for
the
money
and
ruin
myself
i
will
rob
the
old
skinflint
chapter
xix
the
prophecy
realized
few
things
are
harder
to
put
up
with
than
the
annoyance
of
a
good
wilson
calendar
it
were
not
best
that
we
should
all
think
alike
it
is
difference
of
opinion
that
makes
wilson
calendar
dawson
landing
was
comfortably
finishing
its
season
of
dull
repose
and
waiting
patiently
for
the
duel
count
luigi
was
waiting
too
but
not
patiently
rumor
said
sunday
came
and
luigi
insisted
on
having
his
challenge
conveyed
wilson
carried
it
judge
driscoll
declined
to
fight
with
an
assassin
that
is
he
added
significantly
in
the
field
of
honor
elsewhere
of
course
he
would
be
ready
wilson
tried
to
convince
him
that
if
he
had
been
present
himself
when
angelo
told
about
the
homicide
committed
by
luigi
he
would
not
have
considered
the
act
discreditable
to
luigi
but
the
obstinate
old
man
was
not
to
be
moved
wilson
went
back
to
his
principal
and
reported
the
failure
of
his
mission
luigi
was
incensed
and
asked
how
it
could
be
that
the
old
gentleman
who
was
by
no
means
held
his
trifling
evidence
and
inferences
to
be
of
more
value
than
wilson
but
wilson
laughed
and
said
that
is
quite
simple
that
is
easily
explicable
i
am
not
his
doll
his
baby
his
infatuation
his
nephew
is
the
judge
and
his
late
wife
never
had
any
children
the
judge
and
his
wife
were
past
middle
age
when
this
treasure
fell
into
their
lap
one
must
make
allowances
for
a
parental
instinct
that
has
been
starving
for
or
thirty
years
it
is
famished
it
is
crazed
with
hunger
by
that
time
and
will
be
entirely
satisfied
with
anything
that
comes
handy
its
taste
is
atrophied
it
ca
tell
from
shad
a
devil
born
to
a
young
couple
is
measurably
recognizable
by
them
as
a
devil
before
long
but
a
devil
adopted
by
an
old
couple
is
an
angel
to
them
and
remains
so
through
thick
and
thin
tom
is
this
old
man
angel
he
is
infatuated
with
him
tom
can
persuade
him
into
things
which
other
people
ca
not
all
things
i
do
mean
that
but
a
good
many
particularly
one
class
of
things
the
things
that
create
or
abolish
personal
partialities
or
prejudices
in
the
old
man
mind
the
old
man
liked
both
of
you
tom
conceived
a
hatred
for
you
that
was
enough
it
turned
the
old
man
around
at
once
the
oldest
and
strongest
friendship
must
go
to
the
ground
when
one
of
these
darlings
throws
a
brick
at
it
it
a
curious
philosophy
said
luigi
it
ai
a
philosophy
at
all
it
a
fact
and
there
is
something
pathetic
and
beautiful
about
it
too
i
think
there
is
nothing
more
pathetic
than
to
see
one
of
these
poor
old
childless
couples
taking
a
menagerie
of
yelping
little
worthless
dogs
to
their
hearts
and
then
adding
some
cursing
and
squawking
parrots
and
a
macaw
and
next
a
couple
of
hundred
screeching
and
presently
some
fetid
and
rabbits
and
a
howling
colony
of
cats
it
is
all
a
groping
and
ignorant
effort
to
construct
out
of
base
metal
and
brass
filings
so
to
speak
something
to
take
the
place
of
that
golden
treasure
denied
them
by
nature
a
child
but
this
is
a
digression
the
unwritten
law
of
this
region
requires
you
to
kill
judge
driscoll
on
sight
and
he
and
the
community
will
expect
that
attention
at
your
hands
though
of
course
your
own
death
by
his
bullet
will
answer
every
purpose
look
out
for
him
are
you
heeled
that
is
fixed
yes
he
shall
have
his
opportunity
if
he
attacks
me
i
will
respond
as
wilson
was
leaving
he
said
the
judge
is
still
a
little
used
up
by
his
campaign
work
and
will
not
get
out
for
a
day
or
so
but
when
he
does
get
out
you
want
to
be
on
the
alert
about
eleven
at
night
the
twins
went
out
for
exercise
and
started
on
a
long
stroll
in
the
veiled
moonlight
tom
driscoll
had
landed
at
hackett
store
two
miles
below
dawson
just
about
half
an
hour
earlier
the
only
passenger
for
that
lonely
spot
and
had
walked
up
the
shore
road
and
entered
judge
house
without
having
encountered
any
one
either
on
the
road
or
under
the
roof
he
pulled
down
his
and
lighted
his
candle
he
laid
off
his
coat
and
hat
and
began
his
preparations
he
unlocked
his
trunk
and
got
his
suit
of
girl
clothes
out
from
under
the
male
attire
in
it
and
laid
it
by
then
he
blacked
his
face
with
burnt
cork
and
put
the
cork
in
his
pocket
his
plan
was
to
slip
down
to
his
uncle
private
below
pass
into
the
bedroom
steal
the
from
the
old
gentleman
clothes
and
then
go
back
and
rob
the
safe
he
took
up
his
candle
to
start
his
courage
and
confidence
were
high
up
to
this
point
but
both
began
to
waver
a
little
now
suppose
he
should
make
a
noise
by
some
accident
and
get
caught
say
in
the
act
of
opening
the
safe
perhaps
it
would
be
well
to
go
armed
he
took
the
indian
knife
from
its
and
felt
a
pleasant
return
of
his
wandering
courage
he
slipped
stealthily
down
the
narrow
stair
his
hair
rising
and
his
pulses
halting
at
the
slightest
creak
when
he
was
down
he
was
disturbed
to
perceive
that
the
landing
below
was
touched
by
a
faint
glow
of
light
what
could
that
mean
was
his
uncle
still
up
no
that
was
not
likely
he
must
have
left
his
there
when
he
went
to
bed
tom
crept
on
down
pausing
at
every
step
to
listen
he
found
the
door
standing
open
and
glanced
in
what
he
saw
pleased
him
beyond
measure
his
uncle
was
asleep
on
the
sofa
on
a
small
table
at
the
head
of
the
sofa
a
lamp
was
burning
low
and
by
it
stood
the
old
man
small
tin
closed
near
the
box
was
a
pile
of
and
a
piece
of
paper
covered
with
figures
in
pencil
the
was
not
open
evidently
the
sleeper
had
wearied
himself
with
work
upon
his
finances
and
was
taking
a
rest
tom
set
his
candle
on
the
stairs
and
began
to
make
his
way
toward
the
pile
of
notes
stooping
low
as
he
went
when
he
was
passing
his
uncle
the
old
man
stirred
in
his
sleep
and
tom
stopped
instantly
stopped
and
softly
drew
the
knife
from
its
sheath
with
his
heart
thumping
and
his
eyes
fastened
upon
his
benefactor
face
after
a
moment
or
two
he
ventured
forward
again
one
step
reached
for
his
prize
and
seized
it
dropping
the
then
he
felt
the
old
man
strong
grip
upon
him
and
a
wild
cry
of
help
help
rang
in
his
ear
without
hesitation
he
drove
the
knife
home
and
was
free
some
of
the
notes
escaped
from
his
left
hand
and
fell
in
the
blood
on
the
floor
he
dropped
the
knife
and
snatched
them
up
and
started
to
fly
transferred
them
to
his
left
hand
and
seized
the
knife
again
in
his
fright
and
confusion
but
remembered
himself
and
flung
it
from
him
as
being
a
dangerous
witness
to
carry
away
with
him
he
jumped
for
the
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
as
he
snatched
his
candle
and
fled
upward
the
stillness
of
the
night
was
broken
by
the
sound
of
urgent
footsteps
approaching
the
house
in
another
moment
he
was
in
his
room
and
the
twins
were
standing
aghast
over
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
tom
put
on
his
coat
buttoned
his
hat
under
it
threw
on
his
suit
of
girl
clothes
dropped
the
veil
blew
out
his
light
locked
the
room
door
by
which
he
had
just
entered
taking
the
key
passed
through
his
other
door
into
the
back
hall
locked
that
door
and
kept
the
key
then
worked
his
way
along
in
the
dark
and
descended
the
back
stairs
he
was
not
expecting
to
meet
anybody
for
all
interest
was
centered
in
the
other
part
of
the
house
now
his
calculation
proved
correct
by
the
time
he
was
passing
through
the
pratt
her
servants
and
a
dozen
neighbors
had
joined
the
twins
and
the
dead
and
accessions
were
still
arriving
at
the
front
door
as
tom
quaking
as
with
a
palsy
passed
out
at
the
gate
three
women
came
flying
from
the
house
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lane
they
rushed
by
him
and
in
at
the
gate
asking
him
what
the
trouble
was
there
but
not
waiting
for
an
answer
tom
said
to
himself
those
old
maids
waited
to
dress
they
did
the
same
thing
the
night
stevens
house
burned
down
next
door
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
in
the
haunted
house
he
lighted
a
candle
and
took
off
his
there
was
blood
on
him
all
down
his
left
side
and
his
right
hand
was
red
with
the
stains
of
the
notes
which
he
had
crushed
in
it
but
otherwise
he
was
free
from
this
sort
of
evidence
he
cleansed
his
hand
on
the
straw
and
cleaned
most
of
the
smut
from
his
face
then
he
burned
his
male
and
female
attire
to
ashes
scattered
the
ashes
and
put
on
a
disguise
proper
for
a
tramp
he
blew
out
his
light
went
below
and
was
soon
loafing
down
the
river
road
with
the
intent
to
borrow
and
use
one
of
roxy
devices
he
found
a
canoe
and
paddled
off
setting
the
canoe
adrift
as
dawn
approached
and
making
his
way
by
land
to
the
next
village
where
he
kept
out
of
sight
till
a
transient
steamer
came
along
and
then
took
deck
passage
for
louis
he
was
ill
at
ease
until
dawson
landing
was
behind
him
then
he
said
to
himself
all
the
detectives
on
earth
could
trace
me
now
there
not
a
vestige
of
a
clue
left
in
the
world
that
homicide
will
take
its
place
with
the
permanent
mysteries
and
people
wo
get
done
trying
to
guess
out
the
secret
of
it
for
fifty
years
in
louis
next
morning
he
read
this
brief
telegram
in
the
papers
dated
at
dawson
landing
judge
driscoll
an
old
and
respected
citizen
was
assassinated
here
about
midnight
by
a
profligate
italian
nobleman
or
barber
on
account
of
a
quarrel
growing
out
of
the
recent
election
the
assassin
will
probably
be
lynched
one
of
the
twins
soliloquized
tom
how
lucky
it
is
the
knife
that
has
done
him
this
grace
we
never
know
when
fortune
is
trying
to
favor
us
i
actually
cursed
wilson
in
my
heart
for
putting
it
out
of
my
power
to
sell
that
knife
i
take
it
back
now
tom
was
now
rich
and
independent
he
arranged
with
the
planter
and
mailed
to
wilson
the
new
bill
of
sale
which
sold
roxana
to
herself
then
he
telegraphed
his
aunt
pratt
have
seen
the
awful
news
in
the
papers
and
am
almost
prostrated
with
grief
shall
start
by
packet
try
to
bear
up
till
i
come
when
wilson
reached
the
house
of
mourning
and
had
gathered
such
details
as
pratt
and
the
rest
of
the
crowd
could
tell
him
he
took
command
as
mayor
and
gave
orders
that
nothing
should
be
touched
but
everything
left
as
it
was
until
justice
robinson
should
arrive
and
take
the
proper
measures
as
coroner
he
cleared
everybody
out
of
the
room
but
the
twins
and
himself
the
sheriff
soon
arrived
and
took
the
twins
away
to
jail
wilson
told
them
to
keep
heart
and
promised
to
do
his
best
in
their
defense
when
the
case
should
come
to
trial
justice
robinson
came
presently
and
with
him
constable
blake
they
examined
the
room
thoroughly
they
found
the
knife
and
the
sheath
wilson
noticed
that
there
were
on
the
that
pleased
him
for
the
twins
had
required
the
earliest
comers
to
make
a
scrutiny
of
their
hands
and
clothes
and
neither
these
people
nor
wilson
himself
had
found
any
upon
them
could
there
be
a
possibility
that
the
twins
had
spoken
the
truth
when
they
said
they
found
the
man
dead
when
they
ran
into
the
house
in
answer
to
the
cry
for
help
he
thought
of
that
mysterious
girl
at
once
but
this
was
not
the
sort
of
work
for
a
girl
to
be
engaged
in
no
matter
tom
driscoll
room
must
be
examined
after
the
coroner
jury
had
viewed
the
body
and
its
surroundings
wilson
suggested
a
search
and
he
went
along
the
jury
forced
an
entrance
to
tom
room
but
found
nothing
of
course
the
coroner
jury
found
that
the
homicide
was
committed
by
luigi
and
that
angelo
was
accessory
to
it
the
town
was
bitter
against
the
unfortunates
and
for
the
first
few
days
after
the
murder
they
were
in
constant
danger
of
being
lynched
the
grand
jury
presently
indicted
luigi
for
murder
in
the
first
degree
and
angelo
as
accessory
before
the
fact
the
twins
were
transferred
from
the
city
jail
to
the
county
prison
to
await
trial
wilson
examined
the
on
the
and
said
to
himself
neither
of
the
twins
made
those
marks
then
manifestly
there
was
another
person
concerned
either
in
his
own
interest
or
as
hired
assassin
but
who
could
it
be
that
he
must
try
to
find
out
the
safe
was
not
open
the
was
closed
and
had
three
thousand
dollars
in
it
then
robbery
was
not
the
motive
and
revenge
was
where
had
the
murdered
man
an
enemy
except
luigi
there
was
but
that
one
person
in
the
world
with
a
deep
grudge
against
him
the
mysterious
girl
the
girl
was
a
great
trial
to
wilson
if
the
motive
had
been
robbery
the
girl
might
answer
but
there
was
any
girl
that
would
want
to
take
this
old
man
life
for
revenge
he
had
no
quarrels
with
girls
he
was
a
gentleman
wilson
had
perfect
tracings
of
the
of
the
and
among
his
he
had
a
great
array
of
of
women
and
girls
collected
during
the
last
fifteen
or
eighteen
years
but
he
scanned
them
in
vain
they
successfully
withstood
every
test
among
them
were
no
duplicates
of
the
prints
on
the
knife
the
presence
of
the
knife
on
the
stage
of
the
murder
was
a
worrying
circumstance
for
wilson
a
week
previously
he
had
as
good
as
admitted
to
himself
that
he
believed
luigi
had
possessed
such
a
knife
and
that
he
still
possessed
it
notwithstanding
his
pretense
that
it
had
been
stolen
and
now
here
was
the
knife
and
with
it
the
twins
half
the
town
had
said
the
twins
were
humbugging
when
they
claimed
that
they
had
lost
their
knife
and
now
these
people
were
joyful
and
said
i
told
you
so
if
their
had
been
on
the
handle
but
it
was
useless
to
bother
any
further
about
that
the
on
the
handle
were
not
theirs
that
he
knew
perfectly
wilson
refused
to
suspect
tom
for
first
tom
could
murder
anybody
he
had
character
enough
secondly
if
he
could
murder
a
person
he
would
select
his
doting
benefactor
and
nearest
relative
thirdly
was
in
the
way
for
while
the
uncle
lived
tom
was
sure
of
a
free
support
and
a
chance
to
get
the
destroyed
will
revived
again
but
with
the
uncle
gone
that
chance
was
gone
too
it
was
true
the
will
had
really
been
revived
as
was
now
discovered
but
tom
could
not
have
been
aware
of
it
or
he
would
have
spoken
of
it
in
his
native
talky
unsecretive
way
finally
tom
was
in
louis
when
the
murder
was
done
and
got
the
news
out
of
the
morning
journals
as
was
shown
by
his
telegram
to
his
aunt
these
speculations
were
unemphasized
sensations
rather
than
articulated
thoughts
for
wilson
would
have
laughed
at
the
idea
of
seriously
connecting
tom
with
the
murder
wilson
regarded
the
case
of
the
twins
as
desperate
in
fact
about
hopeless
for
he
argued
that
if
a
confederate
was
not
found
an
enlightened
missouri
jury
would
hang
them
sure
if
a
confederate
was
found
that
would
not
improve
the
matter
but
simply
furnish
one
more
person
for
the
sheriff
to
hang
nothing
could
save
the
twins
but
the
discovery
of
a
person
who
did
the
murder
on
his
sole
personal
account
an
undertaking
which
had
all
the
aspect
of
the
impossible
still
the
person
who
made
the
must
be
sought
the
twins
might
have
no
case
with
him
but
they
certainly
would
have
none
without
him
so
wilson
mooned
around
thinking
thinking
guessing
guessing
day
and
night
and
arriving
nowhere
whenever
he
ran
across
a
girl
or
a
woman
he
was
not
acquainted
with
he
got
her
on
one
pretext
or
another
and
they
always
cost
him
a
sigh
when
he
got
home
for
they
never
tallied
with
the
on
the
as
to
the
mysterious
girl
tom
swore
he
knew
no
such
girl
and
did
not
remember
ever
seeing
a
girl
wearing
a
dress
like
the
one
described
by
wilson
he
admitted
that
he
did
not
always
lock
his
room
and
that
sometimes
the
servants
forgot
to
lock
the
house
doors
still
in
his
opinion
the
girl
must
have
made
but
few
visits
or
she
would
have
been
discovered
when
wilson
tried
to
connect
her
with
the
and
thought
she
might
have
been
the
old
woman
confederate
if
not
the
very
thief
herself
disguised
as
an
old
woman
tom
seemed
stuck
and
also
much
interested
and
said
he
would
keep
a
sharp
eye
out
for
this
person
or
persons
although
he
was
afraid
that
she
or
they
would
be
too
smart
to
venture
again
into
a
town
where
everybody
would
now
be
on
the
watch
for
a
good
while
to
come
everybody
was
pitying
tom
he
looked
so
quiet
and
sorrowful
and
seemed
to
feel
his
great
loss
so
deeply
he
was
playing
a
part
but
it
was
not
all
a
part
the
picture
of
his
alleged
uncle
as
he
had
last
seen
him
was
before
him
in
the
dark
pretty
frequently
when
he
was
awake
and
called
again
in
his
dreams
when
he
was
asleep
he
would
go
into
the
room
where
the
tragedy
had
happened
this
charmed
the
doting
pratt
who
realized
now
as
she
had
never
done
before
she
said
what
a
sensitive
and
delicate
nature
her
darling
had
and
how
he
adored
his
poor
uncle
chapter

the
murderer
chuckles
even
the
clearest
and
most
perfect
circumstantial
evidence
is
likely
to
be
at
fault
after
all
and
therefore
ought
to
be
received
with
great
caution
take
the
case
of
any
pencil
sharpened
by
any
woman
if
you
have
witnesses
you
will
find
she
did
it
with
a
knife
but
if
you
take
simply
the
aspect
of
the
pencil
you
will
say
she
did
it
with
her
wilson
calendar
the
weeks
dragged
along
no
friend
visiting
the
jailed
twins
but
their
counsel
and
aunt
patsy
cooper
and
the
day
of
trial
came
at
last
the
heaviest
day
in
wilson
life
for
with
all
his
tireless
diligence
he
had
discovered
no
sign
or
trace
of
the
missing
confederate
confederate
was
the
term
he
had
long
ago
privately
accepted
for
that
person
not
as
being
unquestionably
the
right
term
but
as
being
at
least
possibly
the
right
one
though
he
was
never
able
to
understand
why
the
twins
did
not
vanish
and
escape
as
the
confederate
had
done
instead
of
remaining
by
the
murdered
man
and
getting
caught
there
the
was
crowded
of
course
and
would
remain
so
to
the
finish
for
not
only
in
the
town
itself
but
in
the
country
for
miles
around
the
trial
was
the
one
topic
of
conversation
among
the
people
pratt
in
deep
mourning
and
tom
with
a
weed
on
his
hat
had
seats
near
pembroke
howard
the
public
prosecutor
and
back
of
them
sat
a
great
array
of
friends
of
the
family
the
twins
had
but
one
friend
present
to
keep
their
counsel
in
countenance
their
poor
old
sorrowing
landlady
she
sat
near
wilson
and
looked
her
friendliest
in
the
nigger
corner
sat
chambers
also
roxy
with
good
clothes
on
and
her
bill
of
sale
in
her
pocket
it
was
her
most
precious
possession
and
she
never
parted
with
it
day
or
night
tom
had
allowed
her
dollars
a
month
ever
since
he
came
into
his
property
and
had
said
that
he
and
she
ought
to
be
grateful
to
the
twins
for
making
them
rich
but
had
roused
such
a
temper
in
her
by
this
speech
that
he
did
not
repeat
the
argument
afterward
she
said
the
old
judge
had
treated
her
child
a
thousand
times
better
than
he
deserved
and
had
never
done
her
an
unkindness
in
his
life
so
she
hated
these
outlandish
devils
for
killing
him
and
should
ever
sleep
satisfied
till
she
saw
them
hanged
for
it
she
was
here
to
watch
the
trial
now
and
was
going
to
lift
up
just
one
hooraw
over
it
if
the
county
judge
put
her
in
jail
a
year
for
it
she
gave
her
turbaned
head
a
toss
and
said
when
dat
verdic
comes
gwine
to
lif
dat
roof
now
i
tell
you
pembroke
howard
briefly
sketched
the
state
case
he
said
he
would
show
by
a
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
without
break
or
fault
in
it
anywhere
that
the
principal
prisoner
at
the
bar
committed
the
murder
that
the
motive
was
partly
revenge
and
partly
a
desire
to
take
his
own
life
out
of
jeopardy
and
that
his
brother
by
his
presence
was
a
consenting
accessory
to
the
crime
a
crime
which
was
the
basest
known
to
the
calendar
of
human
misdeeds
assassination
that
it
was
conceived
by
the
blackest
of
hearts
and
consummated
by
the
cowardliest
of
hands
a
crime
which
had
broken
a
loving
sister
heart
blighted
the
happiness
of
a
young
nephew
who
was
as
dear
as
a
son
brought
inconsolable
grief
to
many
friends
and
sorrow
and
loss
to
the
whole
community
the
utmost
penalty
of
the
outraged
law
would
be
exacted
and
upon
the
accused
now
present
at
the
bar
that
penalty
would
unquestionably
be
executed
he
would
reserve
further
remark
until
his
closing
speech
he
was
strongly
moved
and
so
also
was
the
whole
house
pratt
and
several
other
women
were
weeping
when
he
sat
down
and
many
an
eye
that
was
full
of
hate
was
riveted
upon
the
unhappy
prisoners
witness
after
witness
was
called
by
the
state
and
questioned
at
length
but
the
was
brief
wilson
knew
they
could
furnish
nothing
valuable
for
his
side
people
were
sorry
for
his
budding
career
would
get
hurt
by
this
trial
several
witnesses
swore
they
heard
judge
driscoll
say
in
his
public
speech
that
the
twins
would
be
able
to
find
their
lost
knife
again
when
they
needed
it
to
assassinate
somebody
with
this
was
not
news
but
now
it
was
seen
to
have
been
sorrowfully
prophetic
and
a
profound
sensation
quivered
through
the
hushed
when
those
dismal
words
were
repeated
the
public
prosecutor
rose
and
said
that
it
was
within
his
knowledge
through
a
conversation
held
with
judge
driscoll
on
the
last
day
of
his
life
that
counsel
for
the
defense
had
brought
him
a
challenge
from
the
person
charged
at
this
bar
with
murder
that
he
had
refused
to
fight
with
a
confessed
assassin
that
is
on
the
field
of
honor
but
had
added
significantly
that
he
would
be
ready
for
him
elsewhere
presumably
the
person
here
charged
with
murder
was
warned
that
he
must
kill
or
be
killed
the
first
time
he
should
meet
judge
driscoll
if
counsel
for
the
defense
chose
to
let
the
statement
stand
so
he
would
not
call
him
to
the
witness
stand
wilson
said
he
would
offer
no
denial
murmurs
in
the
house
it
is
getting
worse
and
worse
for
wilson
case
pratt
testified
that
she
heard
no
outcry
and
did
not
know
what
woke
her
up
unless
it
was
the
sound
of
rapid
footsteps
approaching
the
front
door
she
jumped
up
and
ran
out
in
the
hall
just
as
she
was
and
heard
the
footsteps
flying
up
the
front
steps
and
then
following
behind
her
as
she
ran
to
the
there
she
found
the
accused
standing
over
her
murdered
brother
here
she
broke
down
and
sobbed
sensation
in
the
court
resuming
she
said
the
persons
entering
behind
her
were
rogers
and
buckstone
by
wilson
she
said
the
twins
proclaimed
their
innocence
declared
that
they
had
been
taking
a
walk
and
had
hurried
to
the
house
in
response
to
a
cry
for
help
which
was
so
loud
and
strong
that
they
had
heard
it
at
a
considerable
distance
that
they
begged
her
and
the
gentlemen
just
mentioned
to
examine
their
hands
and
clothes
which
was
done
and
no
blood
stains
found
confirmatory
evidence
followed
from
rogers
and
buckstone
the
finding
of
the
knife
was
verified
the
advertisement
minutely
describing
it
and
offering
a
reward
for
it
was
put
in
evidence
and
its
exact
correspondence
with
that
description
proved
then
followed
a
few
minor
details
and
the
case
for
the
state
was
closed
wilson
said
that
he
had
three
witnesses
the
misses
clarkson
who
would
testify
that
they
met
a
veiled
young
woman
leaving
judge
premises
by
the
back
gate
a
few
minutes
after
the
cries
for
help
were
heard
and
that
their
evidence
taken
with
certain
circumstantial
evidence
which
he
would
call
the
court
attention
to
would
in
his
opinion
convince
the
court
that
there
was
still
one
person
concerned
in
this
crime
who
had
not
yet
been
found
and
also
that
a
stay
of
proceedings
ought
to
be
granted
in
justice
to
his
clients
until
that
person
should
be
discovered
as
it
was
late
he
would
ask
leave
to
defer
the
examination
of
his
three
witnesses
until
the
next
morning
the
crowd
poured
out
of
the
place
and
went
flocking
away
in
excited
groups
and
couples
talking
the
events
of
the
session
over
with
vivacity
and
consuming
interest
and
everybody
seemed
to
have
had
a
satisfactory
and
enjoyable
day
except
the
accused
their
counsel
and
their
friend
there
was
no
cheer
among
these
and
no
substantial
hope
in
parting
with
the
twins
aunt
patsy
did
attempt
a
with
a
gay
pretense
of
hope
and
cheer
in
it
but
broke
down
without
finishing
absolutely
secure
as
tom
considered
himself
to
be
the
opening
solemnities
of
the
trial
had
nevertheless
oppressed
him
with
a
vague
uneasiness
his
being
a
nature
sensitive
to
even
the
smallest
alarms
but
from
the
moment
that
the
poverty
and
weakness
of
wilson
case
lay
exposed
to
the
court
he
was
comfortable
once
more
even
jubilant
he
left
the
sarcastically
sorry
for
wilson
the
clarksons
met
an
unknown
woman
in
the
back
lane
he
said
to
himself
that
is
his
case
i
give
him
a
century
to
find
her
in
a
couple
of
them
if
he
likes
a
woman
who
does
exist
any
longer
and
the
clothes
that
gave
her
her
sex
burnt
up
and
the
ashes
thrown
away
oh
certainly
find
her
easy
enough
this
reflection
set
him
to
admiring
for
the
hundredth
time
the
shrewd
ingenuities
by
which
he
had
insured
himself
against
detection
more
against
even
suspicion
nearly
always
in
cases
like
this
there
is
some
little
detail
or
other
overlooked
some
wee
little
track
or
trace
left
behind
and
detection
follows
but
here
there
not
even
the
faintest
suggestion
of
a
trace
left
no
more
than
a
bird
leaves
when
it
flies
through
the
air
yes
through
the
night
you
may
say
the
man
that
can
track
a
bird
through
the
air
in
the
dark
and
find
that
bird
is
the
man
to
track
me
out
and
find
the
judge
assassin
no
other
need
apply
and
that
is
the
job
that
has
been
laid
out
for
poor
wilson
of
all
people
in
the
world
lord
it
will
be
pathetically
funny
to
see
him
grubbing
and
groping
after
that
woman
that
do
exist
and
the
right
person
sitting
under
his
very
nose
all
the
time
the
more
he
thought
the
situation
over
the
more
the
humor
of
it
struck
him
finally
he
said
i
never
let
him
hear
the
last
of
that
woman
every
time
i
catch
him
in
company
to
his
dying
day
i
ask
him
in
the
guileless
affectionate
way
that
used
to
gravel
him
so
when
i
inquired
how
his
unborn
was
coming
along
on
her
track
yet
hey
he
wanted
to
laugh
but
that
would
not
have
answered
there
were
people
about
and
he
was
mourning
for
his
uncle
he
made
up
his
mind
that
it
would
be
good
entertainment
to
look
in
on
wilson
that
night
and
watch
him
worry
over
his
barren
and
goad
him
with
an
exasperating
word
or
two
of
sympathy
and
commiseration
now
and
then
wilson
wanted
no
supper
he
had
no
appetite
he
got
out
all
the
of
girls
and
women
in
his
collection
of
records
and
pored
gloomily
over
them
an
hour
or
more
trying
to
convince
himself
that
that
troublesome
girl
marks
were
there
somewhere
and
had
been
overlooked
but
it
was
not
so
he
drew
back
his
chair
clasped
his
hands
over
his
head
and
gave
himself
up
to
dull
and
arid
musings
tom
driscoll
dropped
in
an
hour
after
dark
and
said
with
a
pleasant
laugh
as
he
took
a
seat
hello
we
gone
back
to
the
amusements
of
our
days
of
neglect
and
obscurity
for
consolation
have
we
and
he
took
up
one
of
the
glass
strips
and
held
it
against
the
light
to
inspect
it
come
cheer
up
old
man
there
no
use
in
losing
your
grip
and
going
back
to
this
merely
because
this
big
sunspot
is
drifting
across
your
shiny
new
disk
it
pass
and
you
be
all
right
again
and
he
laid
the
glass
down
did
you
think
you
could
win
always
oh
no
said
wilson
with
a
sigh
i
did
expect
that
but
i
believe
luigi
killed
your
uncle
and
i
feel
very
sorry
for
him
it
makes
me
blue
and
you
would
feel
as
i
do
tom
if
you
were
not
prejudiced
against
those
young
fellows
i
do
know
about
that
and
tom
countenance
darkened
for
his
memory
reverted
to
his
kicking
i
owe
them
no
good
will
considering
the
brunette
one
treatment
of
me
that
night
prejudice
or
no
prejudice
i
do
like
them
and
when
they
get
their
deserts
you
not
going
to
find
me
sitting
on
the
mourner
bench
he
took
up
another
strip
of
glass
and
exclaimed
why
here
old
roxy
label
are
you
going
to
ornament
the
royal
palaces
with
nigger
too
by
the
date
here
i
was
seven
months
old
when
this
was
done
and
she
was
nursing
me
and
her
little
nigger
cub
there
a
line
straight
across
her
how
comes
that
and
tom
held
out
the
piece
of
glass
to
wilson
that
is
common
said
the
bored
man
wearily
scar
of
a
cut
or
a
scratch
usually
and
he
took
the
strip
of
glass
indifferently
and
raised
it
toward
the
lamp
all
the
blood
sunk
suddenly
out
of
his
face
his
hand
quaked
and
he
gazed
at
the
polished
surface
before
him
with
the
glassy
stare
of
a
corpse
great
heavens
what
the
matter
with
you
wilson
are
you
going
to
faint
tom
sprang
for
a
glass
of
water
and
offered
it
but
wilson
shrank
shuddering
from
him
and
said
no
no
take
it
away
his
breast
was
rising
and
falling
and
he
moved
his
head
about
in
a
dull
and
wandering
way
like
a
person
who
had
been
stunned
presently
he
said
i
shall
feel
better
when
i
get
to
bed
i
have
been
overwrought
yes
and
over
worked
for
many
days
then
i
leave
you
and
let
you
to
get
to
your
rest
old
man
but
as
tom
went
out
he
could
deny
himself
a
small
parting
gibe
do
take
it
so
hard
a
body
ca
win
every
time
you
hang
somebody
yet
wilson
muttered
to
himself
it
is
no
lie
to
say
i
am
sorry
i
have
to
begin
with
you
miserable
dog
though
you
are
he
braced
himself
up
with
a
glass
of
cold
whisky
and
went
to
work
again
he
did
not
compare
the
new
unintentionally
left
by
tom
a
few
minutes
before
on
roxy
glass
with
the
tracings
of
the
marks
left
on
the
there
being
no
need
for
that
for
his
trained
eye
but
busied
himself
with
another
matter
muttering
from
time
to
time
idiot
that
i
was
nothing
but
a
girl
would
do
me
a
man
in
girl
clothes
never
occurred
to
me
first
he
hunted
out
the
plate
containing
the
made
by
tom
when
he
was
twelve
years
old
and
laid
it
by
itself
then
he
brought
forth
the
marks
made
by
baby
fingers
when
he
was
a
suckling
of
seven
months
and
placed
these
two
plates
with
the
one
containing
this
subject
newly
and
unconsciously
made
record
now
the
series
is
complete
he
said
with
satisfaction
and
sat
down
to
inspect
these
things
and
enjoy
them
but
his
enjoyment
was
brief
he
stared
a
considerable
time
at
the
three
strips
and
seemed
stupefied
with
astonishment
at
last
he
put
them
down
and
said
i
ca
make
it
out
at
all
hang
it
the
baby
do
tally
with
the
others
he
walked
the
floor
for
half
an
hour
puzzling
over
his
enigma
then
he
hunted
out
two
other
glass
plates
he
sat
down
and
puzzled
over
these
things
a
good
while
but
kept
muttering
it
no
use
i
ca
understand
it
they
do
tally
right
and
yet
i
swear
the
names
and
dates
are
right
and
so
of
course
they
ought
to
tally
i
never
labeled
one
of
these
thing
carelessly
in
my
life
there
is
a
most
extraordinary
mystery
here
he
was
tired
out
now
and
his
brains
were
beginning
to
clog
he
said
he
would
sleep
himself
fresh
and
then
see
what
he
could
do
with
this
riddle
he
slept
through
a
troubled
and
unrestful
hour
then
unconsciousness
began
to
shred
away
and
presently
he
rose
drowsily
to
a
sitting
posture
now
what
was
that
dream
he
said
trying
to
recall
it
what
was
that
dream
it
seemed
to
unravel
that
puz
he
landed
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
at
a
bound
without
finishing
the
sentence
and
ran
and
turned
up
his
light
and
seized
his
records
he
took
a
single
swift
glance
at
them
and
cried
out
it
so
heavens
what
a
revelation
and
for
years
no
man
has
ever
suspected
it
chapter
xxi
doom
he
is
useless
on
top
of
the
ground
he
ought
to
be
under
it
inspiring
the
wilson
calendar
april
this
is
the
day
upon
which
we
are
reminded
of
what
we
are
on
the
other
three
hundred
and
wilson
calendar
wilson
put
on
enough
clothes
for
business
purposes
and
went
to
work
under
a
high
pressure
of
steam
he
was
awake
all
over
all
sense
of
weariness
had
been
swept
away
by
the
invigorating
refreshment
of
the
great
and
hopeful
discovery
which
he
had
made
he
made
fine
and
accurate
reproductions
of
a
number
of
his
records
and
then
enlarged
them
on
a
scale
of
ten
to
one
with
his
pantograph
he
did
these
pantograph
enlargements
on
sheets
of
white
cardboard
and
made
each
individual
line
of
the
bewildering
maze
of
whorls
or
curves
or
loops
which
constituted
the
pattern
of
a
record
stand
out
bold
and
black
by
reinforcing
it
with
ink
to
the
untrained
eye
the
collection
of
delicate
originals
made
by
the
human
finger
on
the
glass
plates
looked
about
alike
but
when
enlarged
ten
times
they
resembled
the
markings
of
a
block
of
wood
that
has
been
sawed
across
the
grain
and
the
dullest
eye
could
detect
at
a
glance
and
at
a
distance
of
many
feet
that
no
two
of
the
patterns
were
alike
when
wilson
had
at
last
finished
his
tedious
and
difficult
work
he
arranged
its
results
according
to
a
plan
in
which
a
progressive
order
and
sequence
was
a
principal
feature
then
he
added
to
the
batch
several
pantograph
enlargements
which
he
had
made
from
time
to
time
in
bygone
years
the
night
was
spent
and
the
day
well
advanced
now
by
the
time
he
had
snatched
a
trifle
of
breakfast
it
was
nine
and
the
court
was
ready
to
begin
its
sitting
he
was
in
his
place
twelve
minutes
later
with
his
records
tom
driscoll
caught
a
slight
glimpse
of
the
records
and
nudged
his
nearest
friend
and
said
with
a
wink
got
a
rare
eye
to
business
thinks
that
as
long
as
he
ca
win
his
case
it
at
least
a
noble
good
chance
to
advertise
his
decorations
without
any
expense
wilson
was
informed
that
his
witnesses
had
been
delayed
but
would
arrive
presently
but
he
rose
and
said
he
should
probably
not
have
occasion
to
make
use
of
their
testimony
an
amused
murmur
ran
through
the
room
it
a
clean
backdown
he
gives
up
without
hitting
a
lick
wilson
continued
i
have
other
testimony
and
better
this
compelled
interest
and
evoked
murmurs
of
surprise
that
had
a
detectable
ingredient
of
disappointment
in
them
if
i
seem
to
be
springing
this
evidence
upon
the
court
i
offer
as
my
justification
for
this
that
i
did
not
discover
its
existence
until
late
last
night
and
have
been
engaged
in
examining
and
classifying
it
ever
since
until
half
an
hour
ago
i
shall
offer
it
presently
but
first
i
wish
to
say
a
few
preliminary
words
may
it
please
the
court
the
claim
given
the
front
place
the
claim
most
persistently
urged
the
claim
most
strenuously
and
i
may
even
say
aggressively
and
defiantly
insisted
upon
by
the
prosecution
is
this
that
the
person
whose
hand
left
the
upon
the
handle
of
the
indian
knife
is
the
person
who
committed
the
murder
wilson
paused
during
several
moments
to
give
impressiveness
to
what
he
was
about
to
say
and
then
added
tranquilly
we
grant
that
claim
it
was
an
electrical
surprise
no
one
was
prepared
for
such
an
admission
a
buzz
of
astonishment
rose
on
all
sides
and
people
were
heard
to
intimate
that
the
overworked
lawyer
had
lost
his
mind
even
the
veteran
judge
accustomed
as
he
was
to
legal
ambushes
and
masked
batteries
in
criminal
procedure
was
not
sure
that
his
ears
were
not
deceiving
him
and
asked
counsel
what
it
was
he
had
said
impassive
face
betrayed
no
sign
but
his
attitude
and
bearing
lost
something
of
their
careless
confidence
for
a
moment
wilson
resumed
we
not
only
grant
that
claim
but
we
welcome
it
and
strongly
endorse
it
leaving
that
matter
for
the
present
we
will
now
proceed
to
consider
other
points
in
the
case
which
we
propose
to
establish
by
evidence
and
shall
include
that
one
in
the
chain
in
its
proper
place
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
try
a
few
hardy
guesses
in
mapping
out
his
theory
of
the
origin
and
motive
of
the
murder
guesses
designed
to
fill
up
gaps
in
it
guesses
which
could
help
if
they
hit
and
would
probably
do
no
harm
if
they
did
to
my
mind
certain
circumstances
of
the
case
before
the
court
seem
to
suggest
a
motive
for
the
homicide
quite
different
from
the
one
insisted
on
by
the
state
it
is
my
conviction
that
the
motive
was
not
revenge
but
robbery
it
has
been
urged
that
the
presence
of
the
accused
brothers
in
that
fatal
room
just
after
notification
that
one
of
them
must
take
the
life
of
judge
driscoll
or
lose
his
own
the
moment
the
parties
should
meet
clearly
signifies
that
the
natural
instinct
of
moved
my
clients
to
go
there
secretly
and
save
count
luigi
by
destroying
his
adversary
then
why
did
they
stay
there
after
the
deed
was
done
pratt
had
time
although
she
did
not
hear
the
cry
for
help
but
woke
up
some
moments
later
to
run
to
that
room
and
there
she
found
these
men
standing
and
making
no
effort
to
escape
if
they
were
guilty
they
ought
to
have
been
running
out
of
the
house
at
the
same
time
that
she
was
running
to
that
room
if
they
had
had
such
a
strong
instinct
toward
as
to
move
them
to
kill
that
unarmed
man
what
had
become
of
it
now
when
it
should
have
been
more
alert
than
ever
would
any
of
us
have
remained
there
let
us
not
slander
our
intelligence
to
that
degree
much
stress
has
been
laid
upon
the
fact
that
the
accused
offered
a
very
large
reward
for
the
knife
with
which
this
murder
was
done
that
no
thief
came
forward
to
claim
that
extraordinary
reward
that
the
latter
fact
was
good
circumstantial
evidence
that
the
claim
that
the
knife
had
been
stolen
was
a
vanity
and
a
fraud
that
these
details
taken
in
connection
with
the
memorable
and
apparently
prophetic
speech
of
the
deceased
concerning
that
knife
and
the
final
discovery
of
that
very
knife
in
the
fatal
room
where
no
living
person
was
found
present
with
the
slaughtered
man
but
the
owner
of
the
knife
and
his
brother
form
an
indestructible
chain
of
evidence
which
fixes
the
crime
upon
those
unfortunate
strangers
but
i
shall
presently
ask
to
be
sworn
and
shall
testify
that
there
was
a
large
reward
offered
for
the
thief
also
and
it
was
offered
secretly
and
not
advertised
that
this
fact
was
indiscreetly
mentioned
or
at
least
tacitly
admitted
in
what
was
supposed
to
be
safe
circumstances
but
may
not
have
been
the
thief
may
have
been
present
himself
tom
driscoll
had
been
looking
at
the
speaker
but
dropped
his
eyes
at
this
point
in
that
case
he
would
retain
the
knife
in
his
possession
not
daring
to
offer
it
for
sale
or
for
pledge
in
a
there
was
a
nodding
of
heads
among
the
audience
by
way
of
admission
that
this
was
not
a
bad
stroke
i
shall
prove
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury
that
there
was
a
person
in
judge
driscoll
room
several
minutes
before
the
accused
entered
it
this
produced
a
strong
sensation
the
last
in
the
roused
up
now
and
made
preparation
to
listen
if
it
shall
seem
necessary
i
will
prove
by
the
misses
clarkson
that
they
met
a
veiled
person
ostensibly
a
woman
coming
out
of
the
back
gate
a
few
minutes
after
the
cry
for
help
was
heard
this
person
was
not
a
woman
but
a
man
dressed
in
woman
clothes
another
sensation
wilson
had
his
eye
on
tom
when
he
hazarded
this
guess
to
see
what
effect
it
would
produce
he
was
satisfied
with
the
result
and
said
to
himself
it
was
a
success
he
hit
the
object
of
that
person
in
that
house
was
robbery
not
murder
it
is
true
that
the
safe
was
not
open
but
there
was
an
ordinary
tin
on
the
table
with
three
thousand
dollars
in
it
it
is
easily
supposable
that
the
thief
was
concealed
in
the
house
that
he
knew
of
this
box
and
of
its
owner
habit
of
counting
its
contents
and
arranging
his
accounts
at
night
if
he
had
that
habit
which
i
do
not
assert
of
course
that
he
tried
to
take
the
box
while
its
owner
slept
but
made
a
noise
and
was
seized
and
had
to
use
the
knife
to
save
himself
from
capture
and
that
he
fled
without
his
booty
because
he
heard
help
coming
i
have
now
done
with
my
theory
and
will
proceed
to
the
evidences
by
which
i
propose
to
try
to
prove
its
soundness
wilson
took
up
several
of
his
strips
of
glass
when
the
audience
recognized
these
familiar
mementoes
of
childish
puttering
and
folly
the
tense
and
funereal
interest
vanished
out
of
their
faces
and
the
house
burst
into
volleys
of
relieving
and
refreshing
laughter
and
tom
chirked
up
and
joined
in
the
fun
himself
but
wilson
was
apparently
not
disturbed
he
arranged
his
records
on
the
table
before
him
and
said
i
beg
the
indulgence
of
the
court
while
i
make
a
few
remarks
in
explanation
of
some
evidence
which
i
am
about
to
introduce
and
which
i
shall
presently
ask
to
be
allowed
to
verify
under
oath
on
the
witness
stand
every
human
being
carries
with
him
from
his
cradle
to
his
grave
certain
physical
marks
which
do
not
change
their
character
and
by
which
he
can
always
be
identified
and
that
without
shade
of
doubt
or
question
these
marks
are
his
signature
his
physiological
autograph
so
to
speak
and
this
autograph
can
not
be
counterfeited
nor
can
he
disguise
it
or
hide
it
away
nor
can
it
become
illegible
by
the
wear
and
mutations
of
time
this
signature
is
not
his
face
age
can
change
that
beyond
recognition
it
is
not
his
hair
for
that
can
fall
out
it
is
not
his
height
for
duplicates
of
that
exist
it
is
not
his
form
for
duplicates
of
that
exist
also
whereas
this
signature
is
each
man
very
own
there
is
no
duplicate
of
it
among
the
swarming
populations
of
the
globe
the
audience
were
interested
once
more
this
autograph
consists
of
the
delicate
lines
or
corrugations
with
which
nature
marks
the
insides
of
the
hands
and
the
soles
of
the
feet
if
you
will
look
at
the
balls
of
your
fingers
you
that
have
very
sharp
eyesight
you
will
observe
that
these
dainty
curving
lines
lie
close
together
like
those
that
indicate
the
borders
of
oceans
in
maps
and
that
they
form
various
clearly
defined
patterns
such
as
arches
circles
long
curves
whorls
and
that
these
patterns
differ
on
the
different
fingers
every
man
in
the
room
had
his
hand
up
to
the
light
now
and
his
head
canted
to
one
side
and
was
minutely
scrutinizing
the
balls
of
his
fingers
there
were
whispered
ejaculations
of
it
so
i
never
noticed
that
before
the
patterns
on
the
right
hand
are
not
the
same
as
those
on
the
left
ejaculations
of
that
so
too
taken
finger
for
finger
your
patterns
differ
from
your
neighbor
comparisons
were
made
all
over
the
house
even
the
judge
and
jury
were
absorbed
in
this
curious
work
the
patterns
of
a
twin
right
hand
are
not
the
same
as
those
on
his
left
one
patterns
are
never
the
same
as
his
patterns
the
jury
will
find
that
the
patterns
upon
the
of
the
accused
follow
this
rule
an
examination
of
the
twins
hands
was
begun
at
once
you
have
often
heard
of
twins
who
were
so
exactly
alike
that
when
dressed
alike
their
own
parents
could
not
tell
them
apart
yet
there
was
never
a
twin
born
into
this
world
that
did
not
carry
from
birth
to
death
a
sure
identifier
in
this
mysterious
and
marvelous
natal
autograph
that
once
known
to
you
his
could
never
personate
him
and
deceive
you
wilson
stopped
and
stood
silent
inattention
dies
a
quick
and
sure
death
when
a
speaker
does
that
the
stillness
gives
warning
that
something
is
coming
all
palms
and
went
down
now
all
slouching
forms
straightened
all
heads
came
up
all
eyes
were
fastened
upon
face
he
waited
yet
one
two
three
moments
to
let
his
pause
complete
and
perfect
its
spell
upon
the
house
then
when
through
the
profound
hush
he
could
hear
the
ticking
of
the
clock
on
the
wall
he
put
out
his
hand
and
took
the
indian
knife
by
the
blade
and
held
it
aloft
where
all
could
see
the
sinister
spots
upon
its
ivory
handle
then
he
said
in
a
level
and
passionless
voice
upon
this
haft
stands
the
assassin
natal
autograph
written
in
the
blood
of
that
helpless
and
unoffending
old
man
who
loved
you
and
whom
you
all
loved
there
is
but
one
man
in
the
whole
earth
whose
hand
can
duplicate
that
crimson
sign
he
paused
and
raised
his
eyes
to
the
pendulum
swinging
back
and
forth
and
please
god
we
will
produce
that
man
in
this
room
before
the
clock
strikes
noon
stunned
distraught
unconscious
of
its
own
movement
the
house
half
rose
as
if
expecting
to
see
the
murderer
appear
at
the
door
and
a
breeze
of
muttered
ejaculations
swept
the
place
order
in
the
court
sit
down
this
from
the
sheriff
he
was
obeyed
and
quiet
reigned
again
wilson
stole
a
glance
at
tom
and
said
to
himself
he
is
flying
signals
of
distress
now
even
people
who
despise
him
are
pitying
him
they
think
this
is
a
hard
ordeal
for
a
young
fellow
who
has
lost
his
benefactor
by
so
cruel
a
stroke
and
they
are
right
he
resumed
his
speech
for
more
than
twenty
years
i
have
amused
my
compulsory
leisure
with
collecting
these
curious
physical
signatures
in
this
town
at
my
house
i
have
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
them
each
and
every
one
is
labelled
with
name
and
date
not
labelled
the
next
day
or
even
the
next
hour
but
in
the
very
minute
that
the
impression
was
taken
when
i
go
upon
the
witness
stand
i
will
repeat
under
oath
the
things
which
i
am
now
saying
i
have
the
of
the
court
the
sheriff
and
every
member
of
the
jury
there
is
hardly
a
person
in
this
room
white
or
black
whose
natal
signature
i
can
not
produce
and
not
one
of
them
can
so
disguise
himself
that
i
can
not
pick
him
out
from
a
multitude
of
his
and
unerringly
identify
him
by
his
hands
and
if
he
and
i
should
live
to
be
a
hundred
i
could
still
do
it
the
interest
of
the
audience
was
steadily
deepening
now
i
have
studied
some
of
these
signatures
so
much
that
i
know
them
as
well
as
the
bank
cashier
knows
the
autograph
of
his
oldest
customer
while
i
turn
my
back
now
i
beg
that
several
persons
will
be
so
good
as
to
pass
their
fingers
through
their
hair
and
then
press
them
upon
one
of
the
panes
of
the
window
near
the
jury
and
that
among
them
the
accused
may
set
their
also
i
beg
that
these
experimenters
or
others
will
set
their
upon
another
pane
and
add
again
the
marks
of
the
accused
but
not
placing
them
in
the
same
order
or
relation
to
the
other
signatures
as
before
for
by
one
chance
in
a
million
a
person
might
happen
upon
the
right
marks
by
pure
once
therefore
i
wish
to
be
tested
twice
he
turned
his
back
and
the
two
panes
were
quickly
covered
with
oval
spots
but
visible
only
to
such
persons
as
could
get
a
dark
background
for
them
the
foliage
of
a
tree
outside
for
instance
then
upon
call
wilson
went
to
the
window
made
his
examination
and
said
this
is
count
luigi
right
hand
this
one
three
signatures
below
is
his
left
here
is
count
angelo
right
down
here
is
his
left
now
for
the
other
pane
here
and
here
are
count
luigi
here
and
here
are
his
brother
he
faced
about
am
i
right
a
deafening
explosion
of
applause
was
the
answer
the
bench
said
this
certainly
approaches
the
miraculous
wilson
turned
to
the
window
again
and
remarked
pointing
with
his
finger
this
is
the
signature
of
justice
robinson
applause
this
of
constable
blake
applause
this
of
john
mason
juryman
applause
this
of
the
sheriff
applause
i
can
not
name
the
others
but
i
have
them
all
at
home
named
and
dated
and
could
identify
them
all
by
my
records
he
moved
to
his
place
through
a
storm
of
applause
which
the
sheriff
stopped
and
also
made
the
people
sit
down
for
they
were
all
standing
and
struggling
to
see
of
course
court
jury
sheriff
and
everybody
had
been
too
absorbed
in
observing
wilson
performance
to
attend
to
the
audience
earlier
now
then
said
wilson
i
have
here
the
natal
autographs
of
two
children
thrown
up
to
ten
times
the
natural
size
by
the
pantograph
so
that
any
one
who
can
see
at
all
can
tell
the
markings
apart
at
a
glance
we
will
call
the
children
a
and
b
here
are
a
taken
at
the
age
of
five
months
here
they
are
again
taken
at
seven
months
tom
started
they
are
alike
you
see
here
are
b
at
five
months
and
also
at
seven
months
they
too
exactly
copy
each
other
but
the
patterns
are
quite
different
from
a
you
observe
i
shall
refer
to
these
again
presently
but
we
will
turn
them
face
down
now
here
thrown
up
ten
sizes
are
the
natal
autographs
of
the
two
persons
who
are
here
before
you
accused
of
murdering
judge
driscoll
i
made
these
pantograph
copies
last
night
and
will
so
swear
when
i
go
upon
the
witness
stand
i
ask
the
jury
to
compare
them
with
the
of
the
accused
upon
the
window
panes
and
tell
the
court
if
they
are
the
same
he
passed
a
powerful
to
the
foreman
one
juryman
after
another
took
the
cardboard
and
the
glass
and
made
the
comparison
then
the
foreman
said
to
the
judge
your
honor
we
are
all
agreed
that
they
are
identical
wilson
said
to
the
foreman
please
turn
that
cardboard
face
down
and
take
this
one
and
compare
it
searchingly
by
the
magnifier
with
the
fatal
signature
upon
the
and
report
your
finding
to
the
court
again
the
jury
made
minute
examinations
and
again
reported
we
find
them
to
be
exactly
identical
your
honor
wilson
turned
toward
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
and
there
was
a
clearly
recognizable
note
of
warning
in
his
voice
when
he
said
may
it
please
the
court
the
state
has
claimed
strenuously
and
persistently
that
the
upon
that
were
left
there
by
the
assassin
of
judge
driscoll
you
have
heard
us
grant
that
claim
and
welcome
it
he
turned
to
the
jury
compare
the
of
the
accused
with
the
left
by
the
assassin
and
report
the
comparison
began
as
it
proceeded
all
movement
and
all
sound
ceased
and
the
deep
silence
of
an
absorbed
and
waiting
suspense
settled
upon
the
house
and
when
at
last
the
words
came
they
do
not
even
resemble
a
of
applause
followed
and
the
house
sprang
to
its
feet
but
was
quickly
repressed
by
official
force
and
brought
to
order
again
tom
was
altering
his
position
every
few
minutes
now
but
none
of
his
changes
brought
repose
nor
any
small
trifle
of
comfort
when
the
house
attention
was
become
fixed
once
more
wilson
said
gravely
indicating
the
twins
with
a
gesture
these
men
are
innocent
i
have
no
further
concern
with
them
another
outbreak
of
applause
began
but
was
promptly
checked
we
will
now
proceed
to
find
the
guilty
tom
eyes
were
starting
from
their
sockets
yes
it
was
a
cruel
day
for
the
bereaved
youth
everybody
thought
we
will
return
to
the
infant
autographs
of
a
and
i
will
ask
the
jury
to
take
these
large
pantograph
facsimilies
of
a
marked
five
months
and
seven
months
do
they
tally
the
foreman
responded
perfectly
now
examine
this
pantograph
taken
at
eight
months
and
also
marked
a
does
it
tally
with
the
other
two
the
surprised
response
was
no
they
differ
widely
you
are
quite
right
now
take
these
two
pantographs
of
b
autograph
marked
five
months
and
seven
months
do
they
tally
with
each
other
yes
perfectly
take
this
third
pantograph
marked
b
eight
months
does
it
tally
with
b
other
two
by
no
means
do
you
know
how
to
account
for
those
strange
discrepancies
i
will
tell
you
for
a
purpose
unknown
to
us
but
probably
a
selfish
one
somebody
changed
those
children
in
the
cradle
this
produced
a
vast
sensation
naturally
roxana
was
astonished
at
this
admirable
guess
but
not
disturbed
by
it
to
guess
the
exchange
was
one
thing
to
guess
who
did
it
quite
another
wilson
could
do
wonderful
things
no
doubt
but
he
could
do
impossible
ones
safe
she
was
perfectly
safe
she
smiled
privately
between
the
ages
of
seven
months
and
eight
months
those
children
were
changed
in
the
cradle
he
made
one
of
his
pauses
and
added
and
the
person
who
did
it
is
in
this
house
roxy
pulses
stood
still
the
house
was
thrilled
as
with
an
electric
shock
and
the
people
half
rose
as
if
to
seek
a
glimpse
of
the
person
who
had
made
that
exchange
tom
was
growing
limp
the
life
seemed
oozing
out
of
him
wilson
resumed
a

was

to
the
kitchen
and
became

ejaculations
but
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
will
stand

you

and

of
applause
checked
by
the
officers
from
seven
months
onward

has

movements
with

then
slid

to

with
the
words

no

themselves
hoarse
over
every

that
fell
from

for
all
his
sentences
were
golden
now
all
were
marvelous
his
long
fight
against
hard
luck
and
prejudice
was
ended
he
was
a
made
man
for
good
and
as
each
of
these
roaring
gangs
of
enthusiasts
marched
away
some
remorseful
member
of
it
was
quite
sure
to
raise
his
voice
and
say
and
this
is
the
man
the
likes

called

for

twenty
years
he

the

were
heroes
of
romance
now
and
with
rehabilitated
reputations
but
they
were
weary
of
western
adventure
and
straightway
retired
to
europe
roxy
heart
was
broken
the
young
fellow
upon
whom
she
had
inflicted
years
of
slavery
continued
the
false
heir
pension
of
dollars
a
month
to
her
but
her
hurts
were
too
deep
for
money
to
heal
the
spirit
in
her
eye
was
quenched
her
martial
bearing
departed
with
it
and
the
voice
of
her
laughter
ceased
in
the
land
in
her
church
and
its
affairs
she
found
her
only
solace
the
real
heir
suddenly
found
himself
rich
and
free
but
in
a
most
embarrassing
situation
he
could
neither
read
nor
write
and
his
speech
was
the
basest
dialect
of
the
negro
quarter
his
gait
his
attitudes
his
gestures
his
bearing
his
laugh
all
were
vulgar
and
uncouth
his
manners
were
the
manners
of
a
slave
money
and
fine
clothes
could
not
mend
these
defects
or
cover
them
up
they
only
made
them
the
more
glaring
and
the
more
pathetic
the
poor
fellow
could
not
endure
the
terrors
of
the
white
man
parlor
and
felt
at
home
and
at
peace
nowhere
but
in
the
kitchen
the
family
pew
was
a
misery
to
him
yet
he
could
nevermore
enter
into
the
solacing
refuge
of
the
nigger
gallery
that
was
closed
to
him
for
good
and
all
but
we
can
not
follow
his
curious
fate
further
that
would
be
a
long
story
the
false
heir
made
a
full
confession
and
was
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
life
but
now
a
complication
came
up
the
percy
driscoll
estate
was
in
such
a
crippled
shape
when
its
owner
died
that
it
could
pay
only
sixty
per
cent
of
its
great
indebtedness
and
was
settled
at
that
rate
but
the
creditors
came
forward
now
and
complained
that
inasmuch
as
through
an
error
for
which
they
were
in
no
way
to
blame
the
false
heir
was
not
inventoried
at
the
time
with
the
rest
of
the
property
great
wrong
and
loss
had
thereby
been
inflicted
upon
them
they
rightly
claimed
that
tom
was
lawfully
their
property
and
had
been
so
for
eight
years
that
they
had
already
lost
sufficiently
in
being
deprived
of
his
services
during
that
long
period
and
ought
not
to
be
required
to
add
anything
to
that
loss
that
if
he
had
been
delivered
up
to
them
in
the
first
place
they
would
have
sold
him
and
he
could
not
have
murdered
judge
driscoll
therefore
it
was
not
he
that
had
really
committed
the
murder
the
guilt
lay
with
the
erroneous
inventory
everybody
saw
that
there
was
reason
in
this
everybody
granted
that
if
tom
were
white
and
free
it
would
be
unquestionably
right
to
punish
him
it
would
be
no
loss
to
anybody
but
to
shut
up
a
valuable
slave
for
life
that
was
quite
another
matter
as
soon
as
the
governor
understood
the
case
he
pardoned
tom
at
once
and
the
creditors
sold
him

luigi
and
angelo
were
inspired
by
a
real
pair
of
italian
conjoined
twins
who
toured
america
in
the
these
were
giacomo
and
giovanni
battista
tocci
homer
plessy
was
arrested
for
sitting
in
a
passenger
car
on
june
and
one
month
later
he
stood
before
judge
john
howard
ferguson
to
plead
his
case
plessy
was
an
octaroon
who
could
easily
pass
white
four
years
later
the
supreme
court
condoned
separate
but
equal
laws
in
the
famous
plessy
ferguson
case
which
affirmed
the
decision
of
justice
ferguson
in
local
court
these
events
in
unfolded
as
twain
wrote
this
story
and
changed
the
tale
that
he
ended
up
telling
arthur
conan
doyle
released
his
collection
of
short
stories
the
adventures
of
sherlock
holmes
on
october
the
stories
had
already
appeared
in
the
strand
magazine
one
each
month
from
july
to
june
holmes
inspired
twain
to
add
a
component
of
forensics
to
this
story
dialect
the
soliloquies
and
conversations
in
the
novel
follow
some
general
rules
twain
introduced
some
variations
in
the
spelling
of
dialect
and
sometimes
the
sound
of
dialect
but
the
end
meaning
seems
to
be
the
same
thing
below
is
a
table
of
some
of
these
words
and
alternatives
found
in
the

whah
the

as
a

which
played
into
the
decision
to
make
some
emendations

that
were
not

by

in
one
curious
notation
is
that

this
version
our
version
is
based
on
the
publication
of
this
novel
in
hartford
this
was
twain
original
american
release
of
the
novel
in
book
form
a
scanned
copy
of
this
book
is
available
through
hathitrust
the
book
contained
some
spaces
in
contractions
i

dis
ai
t

and
dey
are
some
examples
these
spaces
were
not
retained
in
our
transcription
and
are
not
identified
we
did
make
a
few
other
emendations
these
emendations
were
checked
with
the
version
of
wilson
published
by
harper
brothers
notes
on
emendations
the
errors
on
page
and
page
were
not
changed
in
the
book
so
the
case
for
making
those
changes
may
be
found
in
the
detailed
notes
section
the
remaining
errors
were
corrected
in
the
publication
presumably
authorized
by
twain
who
essentially
made
the
case
for
those
emendations
in

please
note
that
many
print
versions
of
wilson
include
the
phrase
and
usage
have
been
brought
into
conformity
with
modern
usage
and
editors
have
been
liberal
with
their
renditions
of
story
detailed
notes
the
detailed
notes
section
also
includes
issues
that
have
come
up
during
transcription
one
common
issue
is
that
words
are
sometimes
split
into
two
lines
for
spacing
purposes
in
the
original
text
these
words
are
hyphenated
in
the
physical
book
but
there
is
a
question
sometimes
as
to
whether
the
hyphen
should
be
retained
in
transcription
the
reasons
behind
some
of
these
decisions
are
itemized

the

titles
such
as

we

the

by
the
crowd
in
double
quotes
twain
did
not
correct
this
in
the
version
of
the
novel
by
harper
brothers
but
these
lines
are
surrounded
by
wilson
narrative
which
is
already
in
double
quotes
therefore
we
have
used
single
quotes
for
the
two
remarks
from
the
gallery
it
so
i
never
noticed
that
before
that
so
too
conclusion
on

removed

we

not
follow

curious
fate
further

be
a
long
story
