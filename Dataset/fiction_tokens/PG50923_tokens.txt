split
campbell
and
i
brought
our
ship
down
to
a
quiet
landing
on
the
summit
of
a
naked
rock
and
i
turned
to
the
telescope
for
a
closer
view
of
the
strange
thing
we
had
come
to
see
it
shone
eighteen
or
twenty
miles
away
in
the
light
of
the
late
afternoon
sun
it
was
a
long
silvery
that
crawled
slowly
over
the
planet
surface
there
was
no
way
of
guessing
how
large
it
was
at
this
distance
it
might
have
been
a
rope
rolled
into
shape
out
of
a
mountain
or
a
chain
of
mountains
it
might
have
been
a
river
of
dough
that
had
shaped
itself
into
a
great
cable
its
diameter
if
it
had
been
a
hollow
tube
cities
could
have
flowed
through
it
upright
without
bending
their
skyscrapers
it
was
to
the
eye
an
endless
rope
of
cloud
oozing
along
the
surface
of
the
land
no
not
cloud
for
it
had
the
compactness
of
solid
substance
we
could
see
it
at
several
points
among
the
low
foothills
even
from
this
distance
we
could
guess
that
it
had
been
moving
along
its
course
for
centuries
moving
like
a
sluggish
snake
it
followed
a
path
between
the
nearer
hills
and
the
high
jagged
mountains
on
the
horizon
was
it
split
campbell
and
i
had
been
sent
here
to
learn
the
answers
our
sponsor
was
the
well
known
eggwe
the
good
will
expeditions
we
were
under
the
eggwe
code
we
were
the
first
expedition
to
this
planet
but
we
had
come
equipped
with
two
important
pieces
of
advance
information
the
roving
cameras
unmanned
had
brought
back
to
the
earth
choice
items
of
fact
about
various
parts
of
the
universe
from
these
photos
we
knew
that
man
lived
on
this
planet
a
humanoid
closely
resembling
the
humans
of
the
earth
and
that
a
vast
cylindrical
rope
crawled
the
surface
of
this
land
continuously
endlessly
we
had
intentionally
landed
at
what
we
guessed
would
be
a
safe
distance
from
the
rope
if
it
were
a
living
thing
like
a
serpent
we
preferred
not
to
disturb
it
if
it
gave
off
heat
or
poisonous
gases
or
deadly
vibrations
we
meant
to
keep
our
distance
if
on
the
other
hand
it
proved
to
be
some
sort
of
vegetable
a
vine
of
glacier
proportions
or
a
river
of
some
silvery
creamy
substance
we
would
move
in
upon
it
gradually
gathering
facts
as
we
progressed
i
could
depend
upon
split
to
record
all
observable
phenomena
with
the
accuracy
of
split
was
working
at
the
reports
like
a
drudge
at
this
very
moment
i
looked
up
from
the
telescope
expecting
him
to
be
waiting
his
turn
eagerly
i
misguessed
he
did
even
glance
up
from
his
books
rare
young
campbell
always
a
man
of
duty
never
a
man
of
impulse
here
campbell
take
a
look
at
the
before
i
finish
the
reports
sir
if
i
recall
our
code
section
two
order
of
duties
upon
landing
a
forget
the
code
take
a
look
at
the
rope
while
the
sun
on
it
see
it
yes
sir
can
you
see
it
moving
see
the
little
clouds
of
dust
coming
up
from
under
its
belly
yes
sir
an
excellent
view
captain
linden
what
do
you
think
of
it
split
ever
see
a
sight
like
that
before
no
sir
well
what
about
it
any
comments
split
answered
me
with
an
enthusiastic
by
gollies
sir
then
with
restraint
it
precisely
what
i
expected
from
the
photographs
sir
any
orders
sir
relax
split
that
the
order
relax
thanks
thanks
cap
that
was
his
effort
to
sound
informal
though
coming
from
him
it
was
strained
his
training
had
given
him
an
exaggerated
notion
of
the
importance
of
dignity
and
discipline
he
was
naturally
so
conscientious
it
was
painful
and
to
top
it
all
his
scientific
habit
of
thought
made
him
want
to
stop
and
weigh
his
words
even
when
speaking
of
casual
things
such
as
how
much
sugar
he
required
in
his
coffee
needless
to
say
i
had
kidded
him
unmercifully
over
these
traits
across
the
millions
of
miles
of
space
that
we
had
recently
traveled
our
first
voyage
together
i
had
amused
myself
at
his
expense
i
had
sworn
that
he
would
find
in
time
that
he
could
even
trim
his
fingernails
without
calipers
or
comb
his
hair
without
actually
physically
splitting
the
hairs
that
cropped
up
in
the
middle
of
the
part
that
was
when
i
had
nicknamed
him
split
and
the
wide
ears
that
stuck
out
from
his
blond
hair
had
glowed
with
the
pink
of
selfconsciousness
plainly
he
liked
the
kidding
but
if
i
thought
i
could
rescue
him
from
the
weight
of
dignity
and
duty
i
was
mistaken
now
he
had
turned
the
telescope
for
a
view
far
to
the
right
he
paused
what
do
you
see
i
asked
i
can
not
say
definitely
the
exact
scientific
classification
of
the
object
i
am
observing
would
call
for
more
detailed
scrutiny
you
seeing
some
sort
of
object
yes
sir
what
sort
of
object
a
living
creature
sir
upright
wearing
clothes
a
to
all
appearances
sir
you
bounder
give
me
that
telescope
if
you
have
explored
the
weird
life
of
many
a
planet
as
i
have
you
can
appreciate
the
deep
sense
of
excitement
that
comes
over
me
when
looking
out
at
a
new
world
for
the
first
time
i
see
a
animal
walking
upright
wearing
adornments
in
the
nature
of
clothing
i
gazed
and
my
lungs
filled
with
the
breath
of
wonderment
a
man
across
millions
of
miles
of
space
a
man
like
the
men
of
the
earth
six
times
before
in
my
life
of
exploration
i
had
gazed
at
new
realms
within
the
approachable
parts
of
our
universe
but
never
before
had
the
living
creatures
borne
such
wonderful
resemblance
to
the
human
life
of
our
earth
a
man
he
might
have
been
creeping
on
all
fours
he
might
have
been
skulking
like
a
lesser
animal
he
might
have
been
entirely
naked
he
was
none
of
these
and
at
the
very
first
moment
of
viewing
him
i
felt
a
kinship
toward
him
oh
he
was
primitive
in
appearance
but
had
my
ancestors
not
been
the
same
was
this
not
a
mirror
of
my
own
race
a
million
years
or
so
ago
i
sensed
that
my
own
stream
of
life
had
somehow
crossed
with
his
in
ages
gone
by
how
who
can
ever
know
by
what
faded
charts
of
the
movements
through
the
sky
will
man
ever
be
able
to
retrace
relationships
of
forms
of
life
among
planets
get
ready
to
go
out
and
meet
him
campbell
i
said
he
a
friend
split
campbell
gave
me
a
look
as
if
to
say
sir
you
do
even
know
what
sort
of
animal
he
is
actually
much
less
whether
he
friendly
or
murderous
there
are
some
things
i
can
sense
on
first
sight
campbell
take
my
word
for
it
he
a
friend
i
did
say
anything
sir
good
do
just
get
ready
we
going
to
go
yes
i
said
orders
and
meet
both
of
them
split
was
at
the
telescope
both
i
took
the
instrument
from
him
both
well
they
seem
to
be
coming
out
of
the
ground
split
said
i
see
no
signs
of
habitation
but
apparently
we
landed
on
top
of
an
underground
city
though
i
hasten
to
add
that
this
is
only
an
hypothesis
one
a
male
and
the
other
a
female
i
said
another
hypothesis
said
split
the
late
evening
sunshine
gave
us
a
clear
view
of
our
two
friends
they
were
fully
a
mile
away
split
was
certain
they
had
not
seen
our
ship
and
to
this
conclusion
i
was
in
agreement
they
had
apparently
come
up
out
of
the
barren
rock
hillside
to
view
the
sunset
i
studied
them
through
the
telescope
while
split
checked
over
equipment
for
a
hike
the
man
walk
was
unhurried
he
moved
thoughtfully
one
might
guess
his
bare
chest
and
legs
showed
him
to
be
statuesque
in
mold
cleanly
muscled
fine
of
bone
his
skin
was
almost
the
color
of
the
robe
which
flowed
from
his
back
whipping
lightly
in
the
breeze
he
wore
a
brilliant
red
sash
about
his
middle
and
this
was
matched
by
a
red
headdress
that
came
down
over
his
shoulders
as
a
circular
mantle
the
girl
stood
several
yards
distant
watching
him
this
was
some
sort
of
ritual
no
doubt
he
was
not
concerned
with
her
but
with
the
setting
sun
its
rays
were
almost
horizontal
knifing
through
a
break
in
the
distant
mountain
skyline
he
went
through
some
routine
motions
his
moving
arms
highlighted
by
the
light
of
evening
the
girl
approached
him
two
other
persons
appeared
from
somewhere
back
of
her
three
four
five
where
do
they
come
from
split
had
paused
in
the
act
of
checking
equipment
to
take
his
turn
at
the
telescope
if
he
had
not
done
so
i
might
not
have
made
a
discovery
the
landscape
was
the
long
shadows
that
i
had
not
noticed
through
the
telescope
were
a
prominent
part
of
the
picture
i
saw
through
the
ship
window
when
i
looked
out
across
the
scene
with
the
naked
eye
the
shadows
were
moving
they
were
tree
shadows
they
were
moving
toward
the
clearing
where
the
crowd
gathered
and
the
reason
for
their
movement
was
that
the
trees
themselves
were
moving
notice
anything
i
asked
split
the
crowd
is
growing
we
certainly
landed
on
top
of
a
city
he
gazed
they
coming
from
underground
looking
through
the
telescope
obviously
he
did
catch
the
view
of
the
moving
trees
notice
anything
else
unusual
i
persisted
yes
the
females
i
speaking
hypothetically
but
they
be
females
are
all
wearing
puffy
white
fur
ornaments
around
their
elbows
i
wonder
why
you
have
noticed
the
trees
the
females
are
quite
attractive
said
split
i
forgot
about
the
moving
trees
then
and
took
over
the
telescope
mobile
trees
were
not
new
to
me
i
had
seen
similar
vegetation
on
other
planets
which
possessed
a
sort
of
muscular
quality
if
these
were
similar
they
were
no
doubt
feeding
along
the
surface
of
the
slope
below
the
rocky
plateau
the
people
in
the
clearing
beyond
paid
no
attention
to
them
i
studied
the
crowd
of
people
only
the
leader
wore
the
brilliant
garb
the
others
were
more
scantily
clothed
all
were
handsome
of
build
the
sunlight
glanced
off
the
muscular
shoulders
of
the
males
and
the
soft
curves
of
the
females
those
furry
elbow
ornaments
on
the
females
i
said
to
split
they
for
protection
the
caves
they
live
in
must
be
narrow
so
they
pad
their
elbows
why
do
they
pad
their
shoulders
they
do
have
anything
on
their
shoulders
are
you
complaining
we
became
fascinated
in
watching
from
the
seclusion
of
our
ship
if
we
were
to
walk
out
or
make
any
sounds
we
might
have
interrupted
their
meeting
here
they
were
in
their
native
ritual
of
sunset
not
knowing
that
people
from
another
world
watched
the
tall
leader
must
be
making
a
speech
they
sat
around
him
in
little
huddles
he
moved
his
arms
in
calm
graceful
gestures
they
better
break
it
up
split
said
suddenly
the
jungles
are
moving
in
on
them
they
spellbound
i
said
they
used
to
did
you
ever
see
moving
trees
split
said
sharply
those
trees
are
marching
they
an
army
under
cover
look
i
saw
then
the
whole
line
of
advancing
vegetation
was
camouflage
for
a
sneak
attack
and
all
those
natives
sitting
around
in
meeting
were
as
innocent
as
a
flock
of
sitting
ducks
split
campbell
voice
was
edged
with
alarm
captain
those
worshippers
how
can
we
warn
them
too
late
look
all
at
once
the
advancing
were
tossed
back
over
the
heads
of
the
savage
band
concealed
within
they
were
warriors
fifty
or
more
of
them
with
painted
naked
bodies
they
dashed
forward
in
a
wide
semicircle
swinging
crude
weapons
bent
on
slaughter
they
were
waving
short
clubs
or
whips
with
stones
tied
to
the
ends
they
charged
up
the
slope
about
sixty
yards
swinging
their
weird
clubs
with
a
threat
of
death
wild
disorder
suddenly
struck
the
audience
campbell
and
i
believed
we
were
about
to
witness
a
massacre
captain
you
not
going
to
let
this
happen
our
sympathies
had
gone
to
the
first
groups
the
peaceable
ones
i
had
the
same
impulse
as
campbell
to
do
something
anything
yet
here
we
sat
in
our
ship
more
than
half
a
mile
from
our
or
forty
friends
in
danger
our
friends
were
panicked
but
they
did
take
flight
they
duck
for
the
holes
in
the
rocky
hilltop
instead
they
rallied
and
packed
themselves
around
their
tall
leader
they
stood
a
defiant
wall
can
we
shoot
a
ray
jim
i
did
answer
later
i
would
recall
that
split
drop
his
dignity
under
excitement
his
captain
linden
and
sir
just
now
he
wanted
any
sort
of
order
we
saw
the
naked
warriors
run
out
in
a
wide
circle
they
spun
and
weaved
they
twirled
their
deadly
clubs
they
danced
grotesquely
they
were
closing
in
closer
and
closer
it
was
all
their
party
jim
can
we
shoot
hit
number
sixteen
campbell
split
touched
the
number
sixteen
signal
the
ship
siren
wailed
out
over
the
land
you
could
tell
when
the
sound
struck
them
the
circle
of
savage
ones
suddenly
fell
apart
the
dancing
broke
into
the
wildest
contortions
you
ever
saw
as
if
they
been
spanked
by
a
wave
of
electricity
the
siren
scream
must
have
sounded
like
an
animal
cry
from
an
unknown
world
the
attackers
ran
for
the
the
rootless
jungle
came
to
life
it
jerked
and
jumped
spasmodically
down
the
slope
and
our
siren
kept
right
on
singing
ready
for
that
hike
campbell
give
me
my
equipment
coat
i
got
into
it
i
looked
back
to
the
telescope
the
tall
man
of
the
party
had
behaved
with
exceptional
calmness
he
had
turned
to
stare
in
our
direction
from
the
instant
the
siren
sounded
he
could
no
doubt
make
out
the
lines
of
our
silvery
ship
in
the
shadows
slowly
deliberately
he
marched
over
the
hilltop
toward
us
most
of
his
party
now
scampered
back
to
the
safety
of
their
hiding
places
in
the
ground
but
a
few
the
brave
ones
perhaps
or
the
officials
of
his
group
came
with
him
he
needs
a
stronger
guard
than
that
campbell
grumbled
sixteen
was
still
wailing
set
it
for
ten
minutes
and
come
on
i
said
together
we
descended
from
the
ship
we
took
into
our
nostrils
the
tangy
air
breathing
fiercely
at
first
we
slogged
along
over
the
rock
surface
feeling
our
weight
to
be
times
normal
we
glanced
down
the
slope
apprehensively
we
did
want
any
footraces
the
trees
however
were
still
retreating
our
siren
would
sing
on
for
another
eight
minutes
and
in
case
of
further
danger
we
were
equipped
with
the
standard
pocket
arsenal
of
special
purpose
capsule
bombs
soon
we
came
face
to
face
with
the
tall
stately
old
leader
in
the
cloak
split
and
i
stood
together
close
enough
to
exchange
comments
against
the
siren
wail
fine
looking
people
we
observed
smooth
faces
like
the
features
of
earth
men
these
creatures
could
walk
down
any
main
street
back
home
with
a
bit
of
makeup
they
would
pass
notice
captain
they
have
strange
looking
eyes
very
smooth
it
because
they
have
no
eyebrows
no
eye
lashes
very
smooth
handsome
attractive
then
the
siren
went
off
the
leader
stood
before
me
apparently
unafraid
he
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
me
to
explain
my
presence
his
group
of
twelve
gathered
in
close
i
had
met
such
situations
with
ease
before
eggwe
explorers
come
equipped
i
held
out
a
gift
toward
the
leader
it
was
a
singing
medallion
attached
to
a
chain
it
was
patterned
after
a
large
silver
coin
it
made
music
at
the
touch
of
a
button
in
clear
dainty
bell
tones
it
rang
out
its
one
tune
trail
of
stars
as
it
played
i
held
it
up
for
inspection
i
placed
it
around
my
own
neck
then
offered
it
to
the
leader
i
thought
he
was
smiling
he
was
not
overwhelmed
by
the
magic
of
this
gadget
he
saw
it
for
what
it
was
a
token
of
friendship
there
was
a
keenness
about
him
that
i
liked
yes
he
was
smiling
he
bent
his
head
forward
and
allowed
me
to
place
the
gift
around
his
neck
tomboldo
he
said
pointing
to
himself
split
and
i
tried
to
imitate
his
breathy
accents
as
we
repeated
aloud
tomboldo
we
pointed
to
ourselves
in
turn
and
spoke
our
own
names
and
then
as
the
names
of
the
others
were
pronounced
we
tried
to
memorize
each
breathy
sound
that
was
uttered
i
was
able
to
remember
four
or
five
of
them
one
was
gravgak
gravgak
piercing
eyes
caused
me
to
notice
him
suspicious
eyes
i
did
not
know
these
people
expressions
well
enough
to
be
sure
gravgak
was
a
guard
tall
and
muscular
whose
arms
and
legs
were
painted
with
green
and
black
diamond
designs
by
motions
and
words
we
did
understand
we
inferred
that
we
were
invited
to
accompany
the
party
back
home
inside
the
hill
where
we
would
be
safe
i
nodded
to
campbell
it
our
chance
to
be
guests
of
tomboldo
nothing
could
have
pleased
us
more
for
our
big
purpose
to
understand
the
serpent
river
would
be
forwarded
greatly
if
we
could
learn
through
the
people
what
its
meanings
were
to
analyze
the
river
substance
estimate
its
rate
its
weight
its
temperature
and
to
map
its
course
these
facts
were
only
a
part
of
the
information
we
sought
the
fuller
story
would
be
to
learn
how
the
inhabitants
of
this
planet
regarded
it
whether
they
loved
or
shunned
it
and
what
legends
they
may
have
woven
around
it
all
this
knowledge
would
be
useful
when
future
expeditions
of
men
from
the
earth
followed
us
through
eggwe
for
an
extension
of
peaceful
trade
relationships
tomboldo
depended
upon
the
guard
gravgak
to
make
sure
that
the
way
was
safe
gravgak
was
supposed
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
line
of
floating
trees
that
had
taken
flight
down
the
hillside
danger
still
lurked
there
we
knew
and
now
the
siren
that
had
frightened
off
the
attack
was
silent
our
ship
locked
against
invaders
could
be
forgotten
we
were
guests
of
tomboldo
gravgak
was
our
guard
but
he
did
work
at
it
he
was
too
anxious
to
hear
all
the
talk
in
the
excitement
of
our
meeting
everyone
ignored
the
growing
darkness
the
lurking
dangers
gravgak
confronted
us
with
agitated
jabbering

one
of

it
began
to
make
sense
they
wanted
us
to
repeat
the
siren
noises
the
enemy
had
threatened
their
lives
there
could
very
well
have
been
a
wholesale
slaughter
but
as
long
as
we
could
make
the

we

and
i
exchanged
glances
he
touched
his
hand
to
the
equipment

to
remind
me
we
were
armed
with
something
more
miraculous
than
a
yowling

peaceful
march
turned
into
a
spasm
of
terror
the
came
rushing
up
the
slope
as
if
borne
by
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
they
bounced
over
our
path
and
the
war
party
spilled
out
of
them
shouting
a
wild
swinging
of
clubs
and
no
tricks
no
deliberate
circling
and
closing
in
an
outright
attack
naked
bodies
gleaming
in
the
arms
swinging
weapons
choosing
the
nearest
victims
the
luminous
rocks
on
the
ends
of
the
clubs
flashed
shouting
screeching
hurling
their
clubs
the
whizzing
fury
filled
the
air
i
hurled
a
capsule
bomb
it
struck
at
the
base
of
a
bouncing
and
blew
the
thing
to
bits
the
attackers
ran
back
into
a
huddle
screaming
then
they
came
forward
rushing
defiantly
our
muscular
guard
gravgak
was
too
bold
he
had
picked
up
one
of
their
clubs
and
he
ran
toward
their
advance
and
to
all
of
tomboldo
party
it
must
have
appeared
that
he
was
bravely
rushing
to
his
death
yet
the
gesture
of
the
club
he
swung
so
wildly
could
have
been
intended
as
a
it
could
have
meant
run
back
you
fools
or
these
strange
devils
will
throw
fire
at
you
i
threw
fire
and
so
did
my
lieutenant
he
did
wait
for
orders
thank
goodness
he
knew
it
was
their
lives
or
ours
zip
zip
zip
the
bursts
of
fire
at
their
feet
ripped
the
rocks
the
spray
caught
them
and
knocked
them
back
three
or
four
warriors
in
the
fore
ranks
were
torn
up
in
the
blasts
others
were
flattened
and
those
who
were
able
ran
they
ran
not
waiting
for
the
cover
of
not
bothering
to
pick
up
their
clubs
but
the
operation
was
not
a
complete
success
we
had
suffered
a
serious
casualty
the
guard
gravgak
he
had
rushed
out
too
far
and
the
first
blast
of
fire
and
rock
had
knocked
him
down
now
tomboldo
and
others
of
the
party
hovered
over
him
his
eyes
opened
a
little
i
thought
he
was
staring
at
me
drilling
me
with
suspicion
i
worked
over
him
with
medicines
the
crowd
around
us
stood
back
in
an
attitude
of
awe
as
split
and
i
applied
ready
bandages
and
held
a
stimulant
to
his
nostrils
that
made
him
breath
back
to
consciousness
suddenly
he
came
to
life
lying
there
on
his
back
with
the
club
still
at
his
fingertips
he
swung
up
on
one
elbow
the
swift
motion
caused
a
cry
of
joy
from
the
crowd
i
heard
a
little
of
it
and
then
blacked
out
for
as
the
muscular
gravgak
moved
his
fingers
closed
over
the
handle
of
the
club
it
whizzed
upward
with
him
apparently
all
by
accident
the
stone
that
dangled
from
the
end
of
the
club
crashed
into
my
head
i
went
into
instant
darkness
darkness
and
a
long
long
silence
vauna
the
beautiful
daughter
of
tomboldo
came
into
my
life
during
the
weeks
that
i
lay
unconscious
i
must
have
talked
aloud
much
during
those
feverish
hours
of
darkness
campbell
i
would
call
out
of
a
nightmare
campbell
we
about
to
land
is
everything
set
check
the
instruments
again
campbell
the
low
hush
of
split
campbell
voice
would
somehow
penetrate
my
dream
the
voices
about
me
were
soft
my
dreams
echoed
the
soft
female
voices
of
this
new
strange
language
campbell
are
you
there
have
you
forgotten
the
code
campbell
quiet
captain
who
is
it
that
swabbing
my
face
i
ca
see
it
vauna
she
smiling
at
you
captain
ca
you
see
her
is
this
the
pretty
one
we
saw
through
the
telescope
one
of
them
and
what
of
the
other
there
were
two
together
i
remember
omosla
is
here
too
she
vauna
attendant
we
all
looking
after
you
captain
linden
did
you
know
i
performed
an
operation
to
relieve
the
pressure
on
your
brain
you
must
get
well
captain
the
words
of
campbell
came
through
insistently
after
a
silence
that
may
have
lasted
for
hours
or
days
i
said
campbell
you
have
forgot
the
eggwe
code
of
course
not
captain
section
four
section
four
he
repeated
in
a
low
voice
as
if
to
pacify
me
and
put
me
to
sleep
conduct
of
eggwe
agents
toward
native
inhabitants
a
no
agent
shall
enter
into
any
diplomatic
agreement
that
shall
be
construed
as
binding
i
interrupted
clause
d
he
picked
it
up
d
no
agent
shall
enter
into
a
marriage
contract
with
any
native
you
not
trying
to
warn
me
are
you
captain
linden
or
are
you
warning
at
that
moment
my
eyes
opened
a
little
swimming
before
my
blurred
vision
was
the
face
of
vauna
i
did
remember
her
yes
she
must
have
haunted
my
dreams
for
now
my
eyes
burned
in
an
effort
to
define
her
features
more
clearly
this
was
indeed
vauna
who
had
been
one
of
the
party
of
twelve
and
had
walked
beside
her
father
in
the
face
of
the
attack
deep
within
my
subconscious
the
image
of
her
beautiful
face
and
figure
had
lingered
i
murmured
a
single
word
of
answer
to
question
myself
in
the
hours
that
followed
i
came
to
know
the
soft
footsteps
of
vauna
the
caverns
in
which
she
and
her
father
and
all
these
benzendella
people
lived
were
pleasantly
warm
and
fragrant
my
misty
impressions
of
their
life
about
me
were
like
the
first
impressions
of
a
child
learning
about
the
world
into
which
he
has
been
born
sometimes
i
would
hear
vauna
and
her
attendant
omosla
talking
together
often
when
campbell
would
stop
in
this
part
of
the
cavern
to
inquire
about
me
omosla
would
drop
in
also
she
and
campbell
were
learning
to
converse
in
simple
words
and
vauna
and
i
yes
if
i
could
only
avoid
blacking
out
i
wanted
to
see
her
so
often
my
eyes
would
refuse
to
open
a
thousand
nightmares
space
ships
shooting
through
meteor
swarms
stars
like
eyes
eyes
like
stars
the
eyes
of
vauna
the
daughter
of
tomboldo
the
sensitive
stroke
of
vauna
fingers
brushing
my
forehead
pressing
my
hand
i
regained
my
health
gradually
are
you
quite
awake
vauna
would
ask
me
in
her
musical
benzendella
words
you
speak
better
today
your
friend
campbell
has
brought
you
more
recordings
of
our
language
so
you
can
learn
to
speak
more
my
father
is
eager
to
talk
with
you
but
you
must
sleep
more
you
are
still
weak
it
gave
me
a
weird
sensation
to
awaken
in
the
night
trying
to
adjust
myself
to
my
surroundings
the
benzendellas
were
by
night
they
murmured
mysterious
little
songs
through
their
sleep
strange
harmonies
whispered
through
the
caves
and
if
i
stirred
restlessly
the
footsteps
of
vauna
might
come
to
me
through
the
darkness
in
her
sleeping
garments
she
would
come
to
me
faintly
visible
in
the
pink
light
that
filtered
through
from
some
corridor
she
would
whisper
melodious
benzendella
words
and
tell
me
to
go
back
to
sleep
and
i
would
drift
into
the
darkness
of
my
endless
dreams
the
day
came
when
i
awakened
to
see
both
vauna
and
her
father
standing
before
me
stern
old
tomboldo
with
his
face
and
not
a
hint
of
an
eyebrow
or
eyelash
rapped
his
hand
against
my
ribs
shook
the
fiber
bed
lightly
and
smiled
from
a
pocket
concealed
in
his
flowing
cape
he
drew
forth
the
musical
watch
touched
the
button
and
played
trail
of
stars
i
have
learned
to
talk
i
said
you
have
had
a
long
sleep
i
am
well
again
see
i
can
almost
walk
but
as
i
started
to
rise
the
wave
of
blackness
warned
me
and
i
restrained
my
ambition
i
will
walk
soon
we
will
have
much
to
talk
about
your
friend
has
pointed
to
the
stars
and
told
me
a
strange
story
of
your
coming
we
have
walked
around
the
ship
he
has
told
me
how
it
rides
through
the
sky
i
can
hardly
make
myself
believe
tomboldo
eyes
cast
upward
under
the
strong
ridge
of
forehead
where
the
eyebrows
should
have
been
he
was
evidently
trying
to
visualize
the
flight
of
a
space
ship
we
will
have
much
to
tell
each
other
i
hope
so
i
said
campbell
and
i
came
to
learn
about
the
i
resorted
to
my
own
language
for
the
last
two
words
not
knowing
the
benzendella
equivalent
made
an
motion
with
my
arm
but
they
did
understand
and
before
i
could
explain
the
footsteps
of
other
benzendellas
approached
and
presently
i
looked
around
to
see
that
quite
an
audience
had
gathered
the
most
prominent
figure
of
the
new
group
was
the
big
muscular
guard
of
the
black
and
green
diamond
markings
gravgak
you
get
well
gravgak
said
to
me
his
eyes
drilled
me
closely
i
get
well
i
said
the
blow
on
the
head
he
said
was
not
meant
i
looked
at
him
everyone
was
looking
at
him
and
i
knew
this
was
meant
to
be
an
occasion
of
apology
but
the
light
of
fire
in
vauna
eyes
told
me
that
she
did
not
believe
he
saw
her
look
and
his
own
eyes
flashed
darts
of
defiance
with
an
abrupt
word
to
me
he
wheeled
and
started
off
get
well
the
crowd
of
men
and
women
made
way
for
him
but
in
the
arched
doorway
he
turned
vauna
i
am
ready
to
speak
to
you
alone
she
started
i
reached
and
barely
touched
her
hand
she
stopped
i
will
talk
with
you
later
gravgak
now
he
shouted
alone
he
stalked
off
a
moment
later
vauna
after
exchanging
a
word
with
her
father
excused
herself
from
the
crowd
and
followed
gravgak
from
the
way
those
in
the
room
looked
i
knew
this
must
be
a
dramatic
moment
it
was
as
if
she
had
acknowledged
gravgak
as
her
master
or
her
lover
he
had
called
for
her
she
had
followed
but
her
old
father
was
still
the
master
he
stepped
toward
the
door
vauna
gravgak
come
back
i
will
always
wonder
what
might
have
happened
if
he
had
called
them
was
my
distrust
of
gravgak
justified
had
i
become
merely
a
jealous
lover
or
was
i
right
in
my
hunch
that
the
tall
muscular
guard
was
a
potential
traitor
vauna
reappeared
at
once
i
believe
she
was
glad
that
she
had
been
called
back
gravgak
came
sullenly
at
the
edge
of
the
crowd
in
the
arched
doorway
he
stood
scowling
while
we
are
together
old
tomboldo
said
quietly
looking
around
at
the
assemblage
i
must
tell
you
the
decision
of
the
council
soon
we
will
move
back
to
the
other
part
of
the
world
there
were
low
murmurs
of
approval
through
the
chamber
we
will
wait
a
few
days
tomboldo
went
on
until
our
new
friend
he
pointed
to
me
is
well
enough
to
travel
we
would
never
leave
him
here
to
the
mercy
of
the
savage
ones
he
and
his
helper
came
through
the
sky
in
time
to
save
us
from
being
destroyed
we
must
never
forget
this
kindness
when
we
ascend
the
the
ever
moving
of
these
friends
shall
come
with
us
on
the
back
of
the
shall
ride
with
us
across
the
from
that
moment
on
there
was
more
buzzing
around
the
caverns
than
a
hive
of
bees
it
was
like
a
spaceport
before
the
blastoff
of
a
big
interplanetary
liner
the
excitement
was
enough
to
cause
a
sick
man
to
have
a
relapse
or
get
well
in
a
hurry
to
join
in
on
the
commotion
i
did
my
best
to
get
well
quick
where
is
campbell
bring
me
my
friend
campbell
please
omosla
the
pretty
attendant
and
companion
of
vauna
was
always
glad
i
noticed
to
be
sent
on
an
errand
to
split
campbell
wherever
he
was
from
all
reports
he
was
reinforcing
the
defenses
at
one
point
or
another
where
these
caverns
led
up
to
the
surface
they
told
me
he
was
a
busy
man
the
attacks
of
the
savage
ones
had
grown
more
vicious
they
had
evidently
learned
that
the
benzendellas
intended
to
move
back
to
other
lands
so
they
had
grown
bold
in
their
raids
attempting
to
steal
not
only
the
benzendellas
treasurers
but
also
their
women
they
had
not
been
successful
my
good
lieutenant
navigator
and
scientist
equipped
with
capsule
explosives
had
blown
one
group
of
them
into
a
fountain
of
dismembered
arms
and
legs
i
could
just
picture
him
hurling
those
miniature
bombs
at
the
when
they
would
create
the
most
panic
the
benzendellas
had
been
quick
to
recognize
a
good
thing
they
only
wished
he
were
quadruplets
or
better
to
stand
guard
continuously
at
many
entrances
they
brought
him
their
rare
foods
and
furnished
him
with
a
comfortable
couch
they
offered
him
gifts
in
short
they
loved
him
for
his
efficiency
and
for
himself
especially
according
to
the
rumors
that
reached
my
ears
omosla
pretty
little
omosla
i
fear
loved
him
with
a
love
that
might
have
overwhelmed
a
lesser
man
but
i
knew
that
split
campbell
would
not
be
swerved
he
was
devoted
to
duty
dignity
and
the
code
the
code
forbade
intermarriage
with
the
natives
why
did
i
keep
thinking
of
the
code
it
should
have
crossed
my
thoughts
so
often
i
hardly
dared
stop
to
ask
myself
what
continually
brought
it
to
mind
but
i
knew
the
flare
of
jealously
i
had
felt
when
gravgak
had
tried
to
call
vauna
away
from
the
crowd
you
are
feeling
better
captain
vauna
said
to
me
as
she
watched
me
pace
the
floor
you
find
that
you
can
walk
so
you
keep
walking
i
need
to
walk
so
i
can
think
if
you
wish
to
think
you
should
sit
out
on
the
hillside
at
the
time
of
sunset
you
understand
my
words
i
understand
i
smiled
then
rashly
i
added
i
understand
your
words
i
do
always
understand
you
and
you
wish
to
understand
me
yes
why
i
could
think
of
more
answers
than
my
vocabulary
could
handle
i
said
simply
when
i
go
back
to
my
own
world
i
should
be
able
to
say
that
i
understand
the
people
of
this
world
but
you
understand
us
you
see
how
we
live
you
hear
how
we
talk
there
she
pressed
my
hand
that
is
all
you
need
to
understand
is
it
i
am
the
one
who
does
not
understand
you
how
do
you
mean
i
do
not
see
how
you
live
i
do
not
hear
how
you
talk
she
gave
a
little
laugh
only
see
how
you
walk
when
you
think
but
i
do
not
know
what
you
think
i
think
about
you
i
said
that
is
very
nice
i
think
about
you
too
jim
since
the
night
you
saved
us
from
the
savage
ones
i
have
thought
about
you
i
stopped
walking
in
circles
and
looked
at
her
the
soft
light
from
the
luminous
rock
walls
gave
an
ivory
tint
to
her
bare
shoulders
she
wore
a
dress
of
soft
woven
material
designed
with
a
diagonal
line
of
little
from
the
curve
of
her
breasts
to
the
lithe
gracefulness
of
her
thighs
the
garment
accentuated
her
beauty
she
was
backing
away
from
me
smiling
as
if
wondering
if
i
would
follow
her
her
arms
were
bare
except
for
the
ornaments
of
fur
around
her
elbows
these
were
evidently
an
insignia
of
benzendella
womanhood
for
no
woman
of
this
realm
was
to
be
seen
without
them
come
vauna
said
beckoning
me
put
your
ear
against
the
wall
what
do
you
hear
she
pressed
her
head
against
the
wall
and
i
did
the
same
finally
i
made
out
the
faint
vibrations
of
some
distant
rumbling
i
asked
what
is
it
the
round
river
that
moves
like
a
serpent
it
is
an
endless
rope
she
said
it
is
life
life
it
gathers
water
and
food
within
itself
it
gives
life
to
those
who
seek
life
it
gives
life
she
stopped
and
her
pretty
poetic
expression
vanished
my
hands
touched
her
hands
my
fingers
moved
gently
along
her
wrists
her
forearms
then
as
my
touch
neared
her
elbows
a
look
of
shock
came
into
her
eyes
jim
yes
vauna
i
was
trying
to
tell
you
for
a
moment
she
only
looked
at
me
searching
my
eyes
we
understand
each
other
do
we
finally
i
said
then
why
do
we
ask
each
other
questions
yes
yes
ask
me
questions
all
right
i
had
an
impulse
to
start
pacing
again
i
walked
about
for
a
moment
tell
me
vauna
when
your
friend
gravgak
demanded
that
you
come
and
talk
with
him
alone
what
would
have
happened
if
your
father
had
called
you
back
she
smiled
faintly
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
jim
i
had
already
made
my
father
promise
to
call
me
back
i
whispered
to
him
me
back
why
she
gave
an
evasive
little
laugh
you
understand
enough
already
now
it
is
my
question
tell
me
captain
jim
why
do
you
keep
saying
that
you
are
going
back
to
another
world
because
i
am
that
my
duty
when
you
ride
with
us
on
the
you
will
come
with
us
to
another
part
of
this
world
it
is
more
beautiful
than
here
we
are
only
a
few
our
race
lives
in
the
other
part
my
father
came
here
only
to
study
but
soon
the
will
take
us
all
back
and
you
and
your
friend
campbell
will
go
with
us
and
belong
to
us
the
of
an
eggwe
agent
is
supposed
to
be
his
defense
against
any
natives
invitations
no
matter
how
beautiful
or
charming
the
native
all
i
could
say
was
you
do
understand
us
do
you
vauna
do
i
your
people
i
love
and
you
vauna
but
our
orders
are
to
return
i
must
not
think
of
disobeying
my
orders
and
i
assure
you
campbell
is
one
who
would
never
disobey
the
big
silver
shell
will
take
you
away
from
us
yes
you
will
remember
me
yes
always
thank
you
jim
she
was
weeping
i
started
to
take
her
in
my
arms
but
thought
better
of
it
she
dried
her
eyes
i
will
remember
you
too
when
i
see
campbell
and
omosla
i
will
have
a
dream
of
this
hour
and
how
we
did
understand
i
was
quick
to
make
a
correction
you
not
be
seeing
campbell
have
to
take
him
back
with
me
you
know
no
he
will
be
here
it
is
our
rule
that
he
should
stay
why
because
he
has
become
the
mate
of
our
girl
omosla
i
looked
at
her
not
believing
i
had
heard
her
words
correctly
a
fever
swept
my
brain
in
my
own
language
i
said
harshly
it
a
lie
campbell
would
never
violate
i
do
not
understand
your
words
vauna
said
softly
then
in
my
broken
benzendella
accents
i
asserted
calmly
but
decisively
i
do
believe
what
you
say
i
do
believe
that
campbell
has
become
the
mate
of
omosla
you
will
believe
vauna
said
when
omosla
baby
is
born
i
had
already
sent
for
campbell
mentally
i
chastized
myself
for
having
sent
omosla
for
if
what
i
had
been
told
was
true
his
life
had
become
complicated
enough
already
i
must
admit
that
for
the
moment
i
had
something
less
than
proper
consideration
for
omosla
did
return
from
the
errand
for
campbell
maybe
the
news
of
my
concern
for
him
had
frightened
her
away
one
of
her
friends
told
me
that
campbell
was
out
on
the
surface
somewhere
that
he
could
be
located
just
now
when
he
returned
they
would
send
him
to
i
then
sought
the
counsel
of
tomboldo
it
ca
be
true
this
story
about
campbell
i
said
there
been
some
mistake
tomboldo
answer
was
soft
spoken
much
has
happened
you
have
been
ill
for
many
weeks
you
must
take
our
word
do
you
find
the
news
not
to
your
liking
omosla
is
a
devoted
girl
and
if
our
hero
campbell
became
her
husband
all
of
us
would
be
proud
there
was
no
use
talking
of
the
eggwe
code
to
him
that
was
plain
all
i
could
say
at
the
moment
was
i
talk
with
campbell
for
the
next
few
nights
after
the
whole
cavern
city
seemed
to
be
asleep
i
would
walk
forth
a
little
distance
this
was
more
than
pacing
it
was
a
test
of
my
strength
and
my
wits
and
most
of
all
my
confidence
that
i
would
not
black
out
it
was
proof
to
myself
that
i
was
a
well
man
again
it
was
a
willful
act
of
striking
out
on
my
own
purposes
i
would
find
campbell
each
night
i
ventured
a
little
farther
the
artificial
lights
burned
low
all
was
quiet
the
luminous
rock
walls
stared
out
from
among
the
cavern
furnishings
i
walked
steadily
i
was
getting
used
to
the
planet
stronger
gravity
i
was
learning
to
like
the
sandals
they
had
given
me
to
wear
cushioned
with
shreds
of
vegetation
tonight
as
always
i
walked
to
the
right
from
the
arch
through
one
of
tomboldo
rooms
and
on
past
the
storage
rooms
the
way
opened
into
a
long
tunnel
the
city
branched
off
in
little
tunneled
avenues
from
this
passageway
would
campbell
be
found
on
guard
tonight
this
way
or
this
way
or
i
heard
light
footsteps
sounds
of
two
persons
somewhere
in
the
distance
i
moved
back
toward
tomboldo
part
of
the
cave
to
wait
until
the
ways
had
cleared
two
men
were
coming
through
the
corridor
conversing
in
low
whispers
i
moved
back
into
the
shadows
scarcely
breathing
the
glow
of
amber
light
from
the
corridor
revealed
them
silhouetted
the
taller
man
was
driving
the
smaller
one
ahead
of
him
threatening
him
with
a
knife
they
slowed
their
steps
their
low
whispers
were
audible
if
you
breathe
a
word
i
rip
you
the
agitated
words
of
the
tall
guard
gravgak
the
light
revealed
the
lines
of
diamonds
painted
on
his
thighs
the
smaller
man
also
a
guard
muttered
have
i
ever
told
anything
you
understand
then
said
gravgak
if
anything
happens
swear
there
was
an
intruder
one
of
the
savages
i
swear
it
i
say
that
i
say
that
he
knocked
you
down
and
forced
his
way
in
like
this
gravgak
struck
him
with
his
fist
the
guard
tumbled
in
a
heap
against
the
cavern
wall
he
lay
there
eyes
closed
gravgak
tiptoed
past
my
hiding
place
his
eyes
glinted
with
purpose
he
paused
at
door
weighed
the
knife
in
his
hand
then
sheathed
it
he
went
on
toward
vauna
room
i
skipped
to
one
side
of
the
storage
room
where
i
had
seen
my
equipment
coat
hanging
without
it
i
could
have
been
no
match
for
this
man
my
fingers
caught
it
off
the
wall
i
got
into
it
as
i
hurried
back
automatically
my
hands
checked
the
contents
everything
in
place
gravgak
was
conversing
with
vauna
through
the
partly
opened
door
i
told
you
i
would
come
you
have
no
right
i
told
you
there
was
strength
not
fear
in
vauna
low
voice
your
father
means
for
me
to
win
you
if
necessary
by
force
you
lie
go
or
i
sound
the
alarm
you
are
in
love
with
that
stranger
his
voice
trembled
with
rage
see
you
do
answer
if
you
want
him
to
live
get
rid
of
him
send
him
back
in
his
silver
shell
you
threaten
my
father
guest
the
great
tomboldo
will
not
live
long
i
have
heard
the
savages
plan
to
come
in
some
night
soon
and
murder
him
at
that
instant
old
tomboldo
voice
sounded
from
the
next
room
there
vauna
gravgak
it
was
gravgak
himself
who
answered
i
came
to
protect
you
tomboldo
there
danger
tomboldo
voice
thundered
with
anger
at
this
unaccountable
intrusion
what
do
you
mean
they
mean
to
kill
you
and
if
they
do
who
the
savages
and
if
they
succeed
i
am
your
successor
tell
your
daughter
it
so
tell
her
that
if
a
knife
blade
descends
from
some
dark
corner
someone
behind
you
it
was
a
ruse
to
cause
old
tomboldo
to
whirl
about
and
turn
his
back
to
gravgak
tomboldo
did
whirl
but
he
must
have
seen
what
i
saw
glittering
in
the
dim
light
the
knife
in
gravgak
hand
it
flashed
up
i
flung
a
capsule
bomb
at
the
arch
fire
flashed
and
the
voices
were
swallowed
up
in
the
concussion
the
swirl
of
yellow
dust
sifted
through
the
cavern
passages
coughing
and
puffing
hard
i
fought
my
way
into
the
heap
in
time
to
catch
sight
of
gravgak
staggering
off
toward
an
exit
tunnel
the
three
of
us
stood
together
a
strange
trio
two
benzendellas
one
earth
man
bound
together
in
an
allegiance
that
all
the
space
in
the
universe
could
never
divide
vauna
was
weeping
softly
holding
her
arms
tight
about
herself
her
hands
cupped
over
the
fur
wrappings
of
her
elbows
she
said
she
could
not
understand
gravgak
behavior
once
he
had
had
a
chance
to
become
the
leader
was
it
all
because
he
was
insane
with
jealousy
because
she
loved
me
her
father
thought
it
was
more
than
this
he
had
evidently
read
signs
of
disloyalty
in
gravgak
even
before
my
coming
too
many
plans
had
filtered
out
to
the
savage
enemies
for
a
long
time
gravgak
had
been
impatient
for
a
chance
to
succeed
tomboldo
my
coming
had
thwarted
the
original
plan
the
murderous
attack
on
the
sunset
meeting
yes
gravgak
had
been
twisting
the
bands
into
his
own
schemes
even
then
the
fine
boldness
showed
in
tomboldo
eyes
as
he
talked
people
had
gathered
and
they
saw
clearly
the
truth
of
his
charges
but
now
there
were
delays
in
getting
ready
to
go
to
the
better
land
on
another
side
of
this
planet
part
of
the
delay
was
caution
gravgak
would
probably
lie
in
waiting
for
the
benzendella
migration
to
the
serpent
river
he
would
plan
an
attack
some
waiting
some
scouting
and
much
preparation
would
be
a
matter
of
wisdom
meanwhile
if
gravgak
could
be
found
let
him
be
killed
on
sight
several
weeks
passed
secret
preparations
for
the
twenty
mile
migration
were
completed
i
was
pleased
to
hear
that
campbell
had
had
a
share
in
these
plans
he
had
made
several
night
hikes
back
to
the
ship
and
had
kept
watch
through
the
telescope
by
day
and
made
valuable
observations
by
means
of
photography
by
night
he
knew
where
the
nests
of
the
savage
bands
were
located
moreover
i
learned
that
he
and
a
few
of
tomboldo
choice
scouts
under
cover
of
darkness
crossed
through
the
area
to
examine
the
serpent
river
at
close
range
and
determine
upon
a
suitable
place
for
getting
the
benzendella
tribe
aboard
for
these
observations
and
for
an
abundance
of
scientific
data
which
he
picked
up
about
the
serpent
river
itself
i
was
deeply
grateful
if
this
expedition
succeeded
in
its
purposes
the
success
would
be
to
his
credit
not
mine
nevertheless
when
i
was
at
last
conducted
to
his
quarters
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
tunnels
my
long
awaited
visit
i
did
not
spend
all
my
time
complimenting
him
for
his
fine
achievements
you
going
to
be
ready
to
make
the
trip
with
the
tribe
i
presume
i
asked
when
we
got
around
to
the
plans
for
the
migration
and
leave
the
ship
here
i
shall
follow
orders
captain
but
i
should
prefer
to
stay
with
the
ship
and
to
proceed
with
the
remainder
of
the
scientific
assignments
he
handed
his
field
glasses
over
to
one
of
the
relief
guards
and
led
me
to
a
bench
in
his
primitive
quarters
a
slice
of
sunlight
knifed
through
from
the
the
first
i
had
seen
for
a
long
time
a
little
sunlight
not
a
bad
thing
i
said
casually
i
been
needing
a
little
light
he
looked
up
at
me
as
if
he
knew
what
was
coming
if
you
been
hearing
a
rumor
do
believe
it
you
heard
it
too
they
say
i
supposed
to
become
the
husband
of
omosla
all
i
want
is
your
word
lieutenant
campbell
i
said
my
word
captain
split
said
dryly
you
know
i
would
break
the
code
i
believe
you
okay
we
in
a
spot
the
fact
is
the
girl
going
to
have
a
baby
when
she
does
she
declare
you
her
mate
and
the
tribe
will
be
proud
have
you
thought
this
through
i
tried
to
i
began
to
pace
you
know
we
ca
afford
to
offend
the
tribe
if
you
bluntly
deny
that
you
had
anything
to
do
with
the
girl
they
be
insulted
they
ready
to
believe
her
not
you
how
soon
will
the
child
be
born
within
a
few
days
how
long
have
we
been
here
long
enough
why
does
her
true
mate
speak
up
whoever
he
is
i
said
that
one
of
the
strange
circumstances
i
have
heard
them
mention
any
other
man
but
you
you
see
split
you
the
hero
of
the
hour
you
the
one
they
want
i
hope
you
not
suggesting
that
marry
this
girl
i
suggested
it
have
but
i
will
ask
this
do
you
like
the
girl
love
her
enough
to
marry
her
under
more
favorable
conditions
yes
i
never
loved
anybody
before
but
omosla
from
the
first
time
i
saw
her
that
evening
in
the
sunset
all
right
split
but
you
still
tell
me
you
have
made
love
to
her
absolutely
you
may
not
know
it
jim
but
i
was
with
you
almost
constantly
for
days
and
nights
after
your
knockout
you
came
through
the
operation
the
riskiest
thing
i
ever
tried
in
my
life
when
you
began
to
pull
out
of
it
i
could
have
gladly
taken
you
back
to
the
ship
and
blasted
off
for
home
but
they
were
giving
you
care
vauna
and
omosla
and
damned
intelligent
care
according
to
my
orders
by
that
time
the
savages
were
knocking
on
our
doors
again
and
i
went
onto
the
defense
job
with
my
pockets
full
of
scare
bombs
and
the
other
kind
too
from
then
on
i
could
have
held
to
tighter
discipline
if
been
in
a
planetary
war
i
swear
it
i
beat
my
fist
lightly
on
split
shoulder
the
fellow
was
great
no
doubt
about
it
and
i
felt
like
a
fool
asking
him
questions
about
matters
outside
the
bounds
of
duty
you
okay
split
you
could
violate
a
hundred
codes
as
far
as
i
concerned
and
i
swear
before
any
court
in
the
world
that
you
tops
but
we
still
got
a
problem
with
this
tribe
and
this
girl
i
not
asking
for
compliments
split
said
for
the
record
telling
you
what
happen
and
what
did
and
here
what
did
now
it
was
his
turn
to
pace
twice
around
the
bench
how
do
i
begin
with
omosla
omosla
comes
to
me
often
she
brings
me
food
and
drink
she
hangs
around
like
a
pet
she
does
touch
me
anymore
i
put
a
stop
to
that
soon
after
the
first
time
she
put
her
arms
around
me
yes
she
did
that
i
was
busy
watching
the
move
down
the
valley
she
was
nearby
murmuring
words
most
of
which
i
could
only
half
understand
i
did
stop
her
when
she
slipped
her
arms
around
me
not
for
quite
awhile
i
remember
plenty
well
the
way
those
pins
in
her
elbow
furs
scratched
my
arms
they
stuck
in
like
thorns
look
you
can
still
see
the
marks
he
rolled
up
his
sleeves
to
show
me
the
slight
scars
on
his
upper
arms
just
above
the
elbows
i
figured
either
she
did
know
those
pins
were
sticking
me
or
else
it
was
some
sort
of
tricky
test
that
girls
use
on
men
to
test
their
metal
so
i
took
it
and
did
wince
sure
i
was
enjoying
letting
her
hug
me
but
after
that
one
time
i
always
kept
my
distance
this
all
happened
when
we
first
came
you
think
she
have
forgotten
especially
if
she
had
a
real
husband
somewhere
on
the
scene
i
groaned
every
tribe
has
strange
customs
when
the
baby
comes
that
when
they
insist
on
a
husband
i
wonder
who
it
really
is
unfortunately
we
ca
prove
anything
by
giving
the
baby
a
blood
test
these
primitives
would
understand
proofs
are
out
campbell
said
however
we
still
have
the
eyelash
test
i
suggested
you
mean
i
mean
that
you
and
i
are
the
only
two
human
animals
on
this
planet
with
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
when
omosla
baby
arrives
without
a
trace
of
an
eyelash
that
might
go
a
long
way
toward
convincing
you
help
me
fight
it
then
if
you
sure
you
do
want
to
change
your
mind
throw
out
the
code
and
claim
the
girl
a
look
of
disdain
was
all
the
answer
campbell
gave
me
at
first
finally
he
said
you
had
ample
reasons
for
nicknaming
me
split
captain
but
so
far
i
given
you
no
grounds
for
applying
the
term
to
my
personality
i
prefer
to
remain
a
member
of
eggwe
in
good
standing
and
to
return
to
earth
with
a
clear
record
let
omosla
name
the
true
father
whoever
he
is
the
whole
benzendella
tribe
made
its
way
across
to
the
with
only
one
casualty
reported
leeger
the
short
slight
guard
who
had
once
been
brutally
knocked
out
by
gravgak
was
reported
missing
everyone
else
came
through
without
a
scratch
it
was
a
triumph
for
old
tomboldo
his
superhuman
courage
had
carried
the
day
children
were
delighted
over
the
adventure
old
folks
were
happy
over
achieving
what
they
had
feared
would
be
an
impossible
undertaking
they
could
believe
now
that
they
would
live
all
through
to
the
end
of
the
journey
for
the
serpent
river
was
a
legendary
giver
of
life
campbell
did
not
come
that
was
according
to
plan
he
kept
in
touch
with
me
by
radio
through
the
final
hours
of
the
crossing
do
you
read
me
captain
i
drawn
them
to
the
north
with
fire
bombs
from
the
ship
guns
they
never
guessed
your
course
no
signs
of
gravgak
or
leeger
not
a
sign
the
city
empty
keep
on
the
radio
campbell
right
captain
by
the
way
how
is
omosla
expecting
i
let
you
know
she
still
talks
about
the
bravest
man
on
the
planet
someone
named
campbell
you
sort
of
look
after
her
wo
you
it
was
two
hours
before
dawn
when
the
last
of
the
tribe
leeger
excepted
gathered
at
the
mountainside
station
to
board
we
waited
for
daylight
strange
smells
filled
our
nostrils
smells
of
wood
fires
sparked
to
life
by
friction
under
the
pressures
of
the
crawling
monster
smells
of
rocks
being
ground
to
powder
smells
of
the
breathing
from
the
pores
of
the
thing
itself
the
giant
the
faint
gray
of
dawn
gradually
changed
to
pink
in
the
growing
light
we
could
make
out
the
contour
of
the
vast
misty
creeping
form
its
rounded
sides
moved
along
only
yards
from
where
we
stood
as
the
light
of
morning
came
on
we
could
distinguish
the
immense
scales
that
covered
its
sides
clouds
of
rose
and
fell
around
it
unrooted
vegetation
would
sift
downward
to
be
bumped
into
the
air
again
or
to
be
rolled
under
small
fires
were
continually
being
ignited
by
friction
and
often
smothered
before
they
were
well
started
sometimes
the
burning
would
creep
up
around
the
curved
sides
only
to
be
snuffed
out
by
the
of
the
massive
thing
i
was
relieved
to
note
that
the
curved
top
the
spine
so
to
speak
was
so
gradually
rounded
that
there
could
be
no
danger
of
anyone
falling
off
its
immensity
had
to
be
seen
to
be
appreciated
as
to
its
length
i
took
the
word
of
tomboldo
and
others
it
was
endless
it
wound
around
the
whole
planet
like
a
mile
serpent
that
had
swallowed
its
own
tail
an
unbroken
rope
of
life
forever
crawling
a
gigantic
creature
a
gargantuan
vine
a
living
thing
i
should
not
say
that
it
was
more
animal
than
plant
when
i
asked
counsellors
was
it
animal
or
vegetable
their
answer
was
yes
yes
yes
it
was
animal
or
vegetable
they
stressed
the
or
must
it
be
one
and
not
the
other
evidently
the
was
not
to
be
compared
not
to
be
classified
but
to
be
accepted
and
utilized
for
this
wandering
tribe
it
was
a
means
of
escape
from
enemies
and
a
mode
of
travel
with
the
coming
of
daylight
they
went
to
work
crude
cranes
swinging
baskets
hoists
one
group
after
another
was
tossed
up
into
the
rubbery
scales
that
covered
the
spine
no
one
cried
out
the
landing
was
soft
and
harmless
the
speed
of
the
crawl
was
not
great
it
must
have
averaged
not
more
than
ten
or
fifteen
miles
an
hour
but
there
were
variations
to
be
taken
advantage
of
the
outsides
of
a
curve
moved
swiftly
foresighted
tomboldo
had
selected
the
inside
of
a
curve
for
our
mounting
where
the
movement
was
sluggish
younger
members
could
leap
across
from
an
overhanging
platform
once
safely
in
the
folds
of
the
surface
they
could
climb
the
rounded
wall
at
their
leisure
three
or
four
hours
were
required
for
the
entire
tribe
to
get
aboard
this
meant
that
a
long
line
was
formed
over
a
span
of
many
miles
this
headless
tailless
serpent
became
inhabited
with
tiny
human
fleas
figuratively
speaking
among
the
stragglers
who
boarded
last
were
a
few
older
persons
who
had
to
be
coaxed
and
pampered
before
they
would
get
into
the
swinging
basket
then
too
there
was
omosla
looking
very
pretty
and
thoroughly
frightened
she
caused
a
slight
delay
at
the
very
last
by
deciding
it
was
time
for
her
to
have
her
baby
finally
we
were
all
aboard
and
the
mighty
unaffected
by
this
addition
of
a
few
specks
of
human
dust
moved
on
at
its
dogged
pace
through
the
mountain
valleys
no
lives
had
been
lost
no
one
had
been
seriously
injured
tomboldo
was
the
heroic
leader
i
went
forward
over
the
lumpy
slabs
of
scales
to
find
him
and
congratulate
him
he
said
the
glad
feelings
are
to
be
shared
and
he
spoke
with
high
praise
of
my
own
help
and
that
of
my
friend
campbell
but
we
are
not
yet
out
of
danger
pass
the
word
pass
the
word
keep
down
out
of
sight
for
several
days
we
would
be
crawling
through
the
lands
of
savages
vauna
found
me
she
had
made
sure
that
omosla
and
the
baby
would
have
the
best
of
care
and
now
she
meant
to
look
after
me
my
dear
one
she
called
me
here
my
dear
one
i
have
your
valuable
coat
come
out
of
sight
the
enemy
must
not
see
you
i
glanced
up
the
long
curved
spine
of
kao
moving
steadily
through
the
sunshine
little
groups
of
benzendellas
could
be
seen
ahead
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
young
children
of
the
party
had
never
had
such
a
trip
before
and
the
older
ones
found
it
a
strenuous
game
to
keep
them
down
out
of
sight
following
tomboldo
order
they
rapidly
ducked
down
into
hiding
the
great
scales
resembled
boxes
set
in
rows
the
deep
flexible
crevices
thus
formed
were
ideal
for
hiding
i
needed
my
radio
i
must
talk
with
campbell
vauna
had
taken
my
coat
she
called
to
me
come
my
dear
one
she
slipped
down
into
a
crevice
a
little
to
one
side
of
the
crest
come
i
hear
the
voice
of
your
friend
campbell
in
the
box
i
coming
speak
to
him
vauna
tell
him
to
wait
shall
i
tell
him
the
news
i
did
answer
the
vertical
surfaces
of
the
scales
folded
together
parted
folded
again
with
the
motions
of
the
great
creature
and
for
a
moment
i
lost
sight
of
vauna
but
i
could
hear
her
voice
as
i
fought
my
way
down
to
her
hiding
place
she
was
talking
through
the
radio
with
campbell
you
are
safe
on
the
big
silver
ship
yes
we
are
on
i
have
been
looking
after
omosla
i
could
hear
the
eagerness
in
campbell
voice
as
he
asked
about
omosla
vauna
answered
him
in
accents
of
joy
she
has
had
her
baby
a
little
girl
very
beautiful
already
she
looks
like
you
has
precious
little
lines
of
hair
on
her
eyelids
and
above
her
eyes
just
like
the
damage
was
done
there
was
no
point
in
my
lying
to
campbell
to
spare
his
feelings
her
words
were
the
simple
innocent
truth
she
was
happy
and
proud
to
tell
the
wonderful
news
her
words
implied
that
campbell
would
of
course
come
and
join
us
when
his
work
was
done
so
he
could
be
omosla
husband
as
all
the
benzendellas
expected
about
all
i
could
say
to
campbell
was
what
she
says
is
true
split
it
a
beautiful
baby
any
father
should
be
proud
i
have
nothing
to
add
for
hours
afterward
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
i
sat
hidden
among
the
deep
soft
scales
listening
now
and
then
the
gentle
movement
would
cause
the
crevices
around
me
to
gape
open
wide
enough
to
reveal
a
strip
of
sky
i
wondered
if
sometime
i
might
catch
sight
of
a
space
ship
bolting
off
into
the
blue
the
only
sounds
i
heard
were
the
faint
muffled
rumblings
of
the
moving
along
like
gentle
thunder
echoing
up
from
somewhere
down
in
the
earth
it
lulled
me
into
relaxation
yet
i
could
not
dispel
the
mental
image
of
campbell
sitting
there
in
the
ship
alone
brooding
over
the
news
and
tempted
no
doubt
to
touch
the
controls
and
leave
this
planet
behind
him
later
i
talked
with
him
again
but
we
did
not
mention
omosla
he
said
he
was
busy
with
his
scientific
findings
i
relayed
to
him
descriptions
of
the
the
inside
story
from
one
who
was
concealed
within
its
scales
we
were
back
to
our
original
assignment
now
for
days
and
days
to
come
we
pursued
the
scientific
facts
comparing
notes
by
radio
at
speed
campbell
made
trips
around
the
planet
and
completed
his
charts
and
maps
he
reported
that
the
beautiful
land
toward
which
we
were
moving
was
indeed
a
land
of
promise
but
he
gave
slower
estimates
of
the
speed
and
he
estimated
that
it
would
take
us
the
larger
part
of
a
year
to
reach
our
destination
however
he
managed
to
get
an
inside
view
of
the
larger
benzendella
tribes
who
dwelt
there
they
were
truly
waiting
for
old
tomboldo
return
and
were
firm
in
their
faith
that
the
rope
of
life
would
bring
him
such
were
the
scientific
and
ethnological
studies
that
campbell
and
i
were
to
share
by
radio
in
the
weeks
and
months
to
come
now
vauna
was
beside
me
we
like
the
others
were
settled
down
for
the
long
journey
innocent
vauna
she
was
trying
so
hard
to
please
me
she
sat
very
close
whispering
to
me
i
listened
and
smiled
and
tried
to
take
my
thoughts
away
from
the
image
of
campbell
his
honor
shattered
by
her
recent
words
to
him
about
the
baby
a
baby
with
eyelashes
a
baby
that
resembled
him
if
i
remained
silent
vauna
would
tease
me
into
talking
with
her
do
my
words
displease
you
captain
your
words
please
me
very
much
you
do
not
look
at
me
you
only
look
away
do
you
want
me
to
sit
close
beside
you
i
drew
her
in
my
arms
and
held
her
in
silence
i
thought
a
thousand
thoughts
that
i
had
brought
with
me
across
millions
of
miles
of
space
later
i
said
to
her
your
arms
are
warm
why
do
you
take
these
fur
things
off
your
elbows
to
be
more
comfortable
she
smiled
and
kissed
me
as
i
had
taught
her
to
kiss
you
want
me
to
and
she
removed
the
furry
white
elbow
ornaments
it
was
very
strange
while
we
hovered
close
she
whispered
to
me
of
the
secrets
of
life
on
this
planet
unlike
any
other
world
i
had
known
and
there
were
curious
legends
of
things
she
had
carried
in
her
heart
to
tell
me
if
such
a
time
as
this
should
ever
come
as
she
talked
the
pressure
of
the
scale
walls
around
us
increased
the
great
was
evidently
moving
through
a
dip
so
that
its
upper
surfaces
were
compressed
there
was
no
lack
of
air
for
breathing
but
the
darkness
and
the
pressure
added
strangeness
to
the
sensation
the
tightness
of
vauna
arms
against
my
own
caused
my
head
to
spin
perhaps
it
was
the
fever
returning
from
my
recent
illness
my
arms
felt
the
stinging
sensation
of
being
penetrated
by
needles
my
thoughts
flicked
back
to
something
split
campbell
had
once
told
me
later
when
the
kao
curved
over
a
summit
and
the
patches
of
sunlight
dashed
in
i
suggested
that
vauna
go
forward
to
see
about
her
father
she
answered
me
with
a
curious
smile
i
snuggled
deeper
into
the
shade
of
the
scales
and
slept
hours
later
when
i
awakened
she
was
again
beside
me
if
omosla
baby
had
been
a
boy
i
believe
that
old
tomboldo
would
have
named
it
for
the
highest
honor
in
the
benzendella
world
he
was
searching
for
a
successor
not
among
the
warriors
and
counsellors
among
the
infants
he
sought
a
child
favored
by
nature
omosla
was
a
beauty
and
a
court
favorite
even
though
she
had
been
a
servant
and
campbell
who
was
considered
to
be
her
mate
though
marriage
had
been
delayed
by
circumstances
was
of
course
a
renowned
hero
if
the
child
had
only
been
a
boy
i
was
kept
busy
reporting
the
reasons
for
campbell
absence
he
had
stayed
with
our
ship
to
guarantee
benzendella
safety
yes
it
was
true
that
he
could
fly
through
the
air
and
catch
up
with
us
but
there
were
duties
which
kept
him
away
my
excuses
wore
thin
vauna
and
her
father
begged
me
to
tell
him
over
the
radio
that
omosla
was
growing
into
a
person
of
sorrow
the
shadow
of
tragedy
hovered
over
her
i
complied
i
talked
by
radio
with
campbell
he
was
in
another
part
of
the
land
now
pursuing
the
purposes
for
which
we
had
come
my
mention
of
omosla
plight
aroused
his
defiance
he
said
he
would
rather
be
a
deserter
than
serve
a
captain
who
did
not
accept
his
word
for
the
last
time
captain
linden
i
repeat
that
i
am
not
the
mate
of
omosla
do
you
believe
me
i
do
know
what
to
believe
i
said
his
radio
clicked
off
vauna
and
her
father
and
i
secluded
ourselves
among
the
scales
and
talked
my
one
question
was
could
there
have
been
any
other
person
among
them
who
had
come
from
another
planet
you
and
campbell
no
others
how
can
you
be
sure
i
pursued
suppose
someone
from
my
world
wished
to
pass
for
a
native
suppose
he
should
pluck
the
hairs
from
his
eyelids
and
cut
away
his
eyebrows
would
you
know
him
to
be
an
outsider
come
vauna
said
we
walk
from
one
end
of
the
tribe
to
the
other
while
the
great
endless
carried
us
on
through
deep
valleys
and
across
wide
plains
vauna
and
i
went
about
day
by
day
studying
the
looks
of
each
male
member
of
the
tribe
i
scrutinized
the
eyes
of
each
i
listened
to
the
native
enunciations
i
got
acquainted
with
each
man
by
name
and
personality
friendship
to
all
was
a
help
through
her
i
began
to
gain
a
bond
of
affection
for
all
these
people
deep
and
solid
their
ways
became
natural
to
me
in
the
night
their
could
be
heard
welling
up
softly
through
the
scales
within
which
they
rested
in
the
mornings
one
could
see
the
parties
of
agile
ones
gathering
food
and
liquid
fruits
that
rolled
within
reach
along
the
sides
of
the
moving
kao
we
crossed
a
series
of
islands
for
long
spaces
there
would
be
danger
of
dips
under
the
surfaces
of
waters
we
would
close
ourselves
tightly
within
the
waterproof
interstices
until
the
danger
had
passed
later
when
the
slimy
surfaces
of
the
scales
had
dried
off
we
would
emerge
and
now
out
of
a
chance
conversation
i
learned
of
another
danger
which
had
been
with
us
all
along
gravgak
was
also
on
the
how
did
you
know
this
i
asked
vauna
sharply
did
my
father
tell
you
i
received
a
warning
soon
after
we
began
the
journey
warning
from
whom
from
leeger
leeger
i
thought
he
was
missing
he
reappeared
he
had
known
of
our
plan
he
had
boarded
somewhere
he
was
back
there
beyond
the
end
of
our
party
he
shouted
the
warning
to
me
that
is
why
you
and
i
moved
up
the
line
and
have
kept
ourselves
hidden
he
shouted
a
warning
to
you
that
gravgak
is
also
on
board
looking
for
me
weeks
earlier
a
search
party
had
given
up
it
had
all
happened
quietly
tomboldo
had
kept
a
few
of
his
top
scouts
on
the
job
as
i
now
learned
and
for
months
after
our
journey
had
begun
they
had
scoured
the
scaly
surfaces
of
looking
in
vain
for
gravgak
could
we
rest
assured
then
that
gravgak
had
been
bluffed
out
that
he
had
given
up
his
purpose
of
trying
to
take
vauna
that
he
had
long
since
climbed
off
the
and
gone
back
home
we
hoped
so
nevertheless
we
moved
cautiously
as
our
searches
took
us
back
through
the
long
line
of
benzendellas
then
without
warning
we
suddenly
came
upon
leeger
he
saw
us
from
a
distance
of
fifty
yards
or
less
we
had
come
to
the
end
of
our
settlement
evidently
beyond
the
end
for
in
the
last
quarter
of
a
mile
we
had
found
no
persons
dwelling
among
the
scales
he
motioned
to
us
vauna
said
i
sure
it
was
leeger
but
leeger
had
disappeared
from
view
back
of
us
now
was
the
wilderness
of
scales
their
curved
surface
glistening
and
alive
with
color
as
the
endless
crawling
spine
followed
us
out
of
the
distant
blue
haze
miles
of
and
nothing
showing
on
the
surface
we
were
down
now
almost
out
of
sight
yet
peering
over
suddenly
the
form
of
leeger
bobbed
up
again
only
a
few
feet
from
us
go
back
leeger
cried
flinging
a
hand
at
us
go
back
he
coming
it
all
happened
in
less
time
than
it
can
be
told
leeger
rose
up
to
warn
us
we
saw
the
knife
fly
through
the
air
at
him
he
fell
with
the
blade
through
his
throat
on
the
instant
we
saw
the
dark
muscular
form
of
gravgak
rearing
up
among
the
scales
the
markings
on
his
arms
and
legs
glinted
in
the
light
he
had
hurled
his
knife
true
triumph
shone
in
his
murderous
eyes
he
had
killed
the
man
who
had
stalked
him
to
protect
vauna
and
tomboldo
and
now
he
must
have
believed
that
one
of
his
prizes
was
within
easy
reach
his
arm
flashed
upward
it
held
one
of
those
rockstrung
clubs
that
the
savages
used
so
skillfully
the
weighted
club
whizzed
through
the
air
i
swung
vauna
off
her
feet
i
swear
the
rolling
movement
of
helped
me
or
i
have
succeeded
we
tumbled
into
the
crevice
then
i
scrambled
upward
another
glimpse
of
gravgak
he
dived
down
among
the
crevices
moving
in
our
direction
a
moment
of
darkness
the
closed
out
the
light
when
they
opened
he
was
there
coming
at
us
i
locked
with
him
we
fought
the
movement
of
the
surfaces
gave
us
an
upward
thrust
i
kicked
and
tumbled
to
the
surface
he
caught
my
wrist
but
the
upthrust
of
the
kao
favored
me
and
i
jerked
him
upward
onto
the
top
of
the
scales
we
fought
in
the
open
the
rubbery
footing
was
deadly
but
it
played
no
favorites
i
struck
a
heavy
blow
that
made
the
lined
arms
shudder
gravgak
eyes
flashed
as
he
plunged
back
at
me
i
struck
him
again
with
the
full
force
of
my
body
he
bounced
and
tumbled
he
rolled
out
of
sight
but
not
for
long
it
was
an
intentional
trick
he
disappeared
in
the
crevice
where
leeger
had
fallen
when
he
came
up
the
bloody
knife
was
in
his
hand
i
heard
vauna
warning
cry
i
leaped
down
into
the
crevice
she
was
trying
to
get
my
coat
she
knew
there
were
explosives
in
it
if
she
could
only
get
them
into
my
hands
no
time
for
that
gravgak
leaped
down
at
me
the
knife
was
rigid
from
his
hand
coming
down
with
a
plunge
i
kicked
back
floundering
against
the
tricky
walls
of
the
scales
and
gravgak
fell
down
deep
where
i
had
been
i
saw
it
happen
a
sight
i
never
expect
to
see
repeated
his
descent
to
the
base
of
the
scales
where
the
walls
joined
might
have
been
a
harmless
fall
yet
who
knows
how
sensitive
is
the
material
of
the
vast
living
thing
called
the
knife
plunged
into
deep
beneath
our
feet
the
flesh
opened
gravgak
whirled
tried
to
escape
the
opening
his
arm
twisted
under
him
and
went
down
as
if
something
drew
it
his
back
his
whole
body
from
hips
to
shoulders
was
caught
in
the
gaping
hole
that
he
had
seemingly
opened
with
a
plunge
of
the
knife
blade
it
closed
on
him
it
severed
him
part
of
him
was
gone
before
our
eyes
there
remained
his
legs
cut
clean
away
and
his
head
and
part
of
one
shoulder
the
rest
of
him
it
would
not
return
to
sight
was
a
living
thing
when
it
wished
it
could
devour
many
of
the
tribe
came
back
to
this
spot
to
examine
what
remained
of
the
traitorous
guard
i
too
observed
him
closely
i
examined
his
eyes
with
a
glass
also
the
eyes
of
the
murdered
leeger
neither
showed
any
traces
of
eyelashes
or
eyebrows
the
tribe
rode
on
tranquilly
there
would
be
new
legends
of
after
what
had
occurred
many
were
the
stories
and
i
relayed
them
to
campbell
at
the
ship
who
faithfully
recorded
them
all
there
was
a
tragedy
to
be
added
it
could
not
have
been
otherwise
for
some
months
the
news
of
omosla
and
her
little
daughter
had
been
vague
it
was
the
benzendella
tradition
that
weddings
should
not
be
delayed
for
long
after
the
arrival
of
the
child
it
was
rumored
that
this
young
mother
now
faced
the
shame
of
having
been
left
without
a
mate
it
was
hard
to
get
exact
information
even
though
vauna
and
i
had
always
sought
an
understanding
between
us
some
things
were
not
talked
about
freely
deepest
most
important
truths
in
new
worlds
are
often
the
most
elusive
now
i
questioned
vauna
closely
and
i
learned
of
the
tragic
end
of
omosla
she
and
her
baby
are
no
longer
with
us
vauna
said
quietly
it
happened
one
night
when
the
stars
seemed
very
close
they
say
she
had
studied
the
sky
each
night
wondering
which
of
the
worlds
beyond
was
the
world
of
campbell
and
then
two
of
her
caretakers
saw
it
happen
but
they
could
not
stop
it
with
the
babe
in
her
arms
she
walked
over
the
side
of
and
went
down
under
vauna
went
on
to
tell
me
that
tomboldo
had
urged
silence
about
it
he
would
always
believe
that
the
girl
had
lost
faith
too
soon
that
campbell
might
have
come
back
when
his
work
was
done
moreover
tomboldo
felt
that
it
was
important
to
the
morale
of
the
tribe
that
both
campbell
and
i
be
held
in
high
esteem
when
vauna
finished
telling
me
these
things
she
said
she
would
ask
me
the
questions
she
had
been
saving
for
many
days
did
you
believe
jim
that
you
would
find
some
other
person
among
us
from
your
world
i
did
know
if
you
had
found
such
a
person
what
would
you
have
believed
then
that
he
and
not
campbell
was
the
father
of
omosla
child
and
what
vauna
asked
are
you
going
to
believe
about
us
when
our
child
is
born
we
were
around
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
by
now
i
estimated
that
we
had
traveled
more
than
seven
thousand
hours
by
this
time
many
things
had
happened
so
much
that
i
doubted
my
ability
to
convey
all
the
news
to
campbell
so
that
he
would
get
a
clear
understanding
i
had
lain
awake
nights
trying
to
formulate
my
message
if
my
words
failed
i
only
hoped
that
my
tone
of
voice
would
convey
my
appreciation
my
appreciation
of
him
of
what
he
had
gone
through
of
what
he
must
yet
go
through
he
talked
with
me
quietly
through
the
radio
and
i
could
visualize
him
as
if
i
were
sitting
beside
him
again
in
the
space
ship
yes
linden
go
on
i
listening
i
told
him
of
the
death
of
omosla
and
the
child
he
was
deeply
grieved
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
found
voice
to
speak
go
ahead
linden
i
listening
i
have
more
news
i
said
but
tell
me
of
yourself
campbell
have
you
gone
ahead
playing
your
lone
hand
i
found
my
way
into
the
customs
of
the
savages
linden
they
have
their
own
legends
of
i
can
predict
that
in
time
the
gap
can
be
bridged
between
them
and
the
benzendellas
if
we
work
carefully
men
like
you
linden
working
from
within
and
other
agents
from
eggwe
that
are
sure
to
follow
i
believe
this
planet
can
be
spared
the
torments
of
great
wars
yes
campbell
and
you
personally
are
you
well
are
you
still
bristling
with
your
usual
in
case
you
have
any
doubts
about
the
matter
his
voice
was
slightly
caustic
i
have
broken
the
code
in
omosla
case
i
wish
you
had
i
said
i
wish
it
too
campbell
voice
came
back
now
in
a
lowered
tone
i
loved
omosla
i
would
have
been
her
mate
gladly
but
you
were
campbell
now
do
start
that
again
linden
or
i
wait
campbell
do
cut
me
off
you
must
hear
all
of
my
news
first
most
important
of
all
old
tomboldo
has
chosen
my
own
son
to
be
his
successor
he
be
groomed
for
the
job
all
through
his
childhood
and
i
decided
to
stay
right
here
code
or
no
code
and
see
him
through
your
campbell
voice
was
mostly
breath
who
are
you
talking
about
our
baby
vauna
and
mine
it
several
days
old
doing
fine
has
eyebrows
just
like
mine
skin
like
hers
campbell
blurted
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
as
soon
as
you
and
vauna
boarded
the
kao
the
ways
of
life
on
this
planet
are
something
you
and
i
ought
to
know
about
campbell
listen
closely
shoot
in
words
of
one
syllable
i
explained
then
what
i
had
at
last
learned
that
the
human
beings
of
this
planet
were
not
precisely
like
those
of
the
earth
they
were
unquestionably
related
somewhere
back
down
through
the
ages
but
nature
had
worked
a
significant
change
in
the
process
by
which
new
life
could
be
started
fertilization
in
the
female
was
accomplished
by
her
own
action
and
her
own
preference
nature
had
equipped
her
arms
arms
did
you
say
campbell
fairly
shouted
through
the
radio
go
on
i
continued
nature
had
equipped
her
arms
i
explained
with
tiny
projections
which
could
penetrate
the
arms
or
sides
of
the
male
like
needles
by
this
means
she
drew
blood
from
his
bloodstream
a
very
slight
transfusion
of
male
blood
into
the
female
bloodstream
was
the
act
that
accomplished
fertilization
you
see
campbell
woman
does
not
bear
a
child
except
by
her
own
premeditated
choice
i
explained
you
and
i
were
puzzled
by
the
elbow
furs
all
these
women
wear
now
you
see
it
a
natural
bit
of
extra
clothing
the
dictates
of
modesty
well
campbell
said
then
you
and
i
allowed
ourselves
we
were
simply
chosen
not
knowing
the
score
we
were
innocent
bystanders
well
more
or
less
innocent
and
pitifully
ignorant
unfortunately
for
us
these
were
matters
the
benzendellas
do
talk
about
freely
campbell
paused
for
a
moment
of
confused
thinking
just
a
minute
captain
i
been
observing
these
savages
home
life
and
all
no
lack
of
normal
affections
among
them
in
our
own
sense
of
the
word
they
equipped
physically
just
as
we
are
plus
the
arm
thorns
they
have
the
same
organs
the
same
functions
for
purposes
of
affection
yes
but
the
arms
that
separate
for
conception
well
i
be
blasted
campbell
was
speechless
for
a
long
moment
then
i
think
i
go
back
to
earth
i
was
not
surprised
at
his
decision
it
was
what
i
expected
what
i
would
have
advised
he
had
had
more
than
one
man
share
of
this
planet
for
one
who
did
expect
to
take
root
here
but
my
own
life
here
was
just
beginning
i
had
thought
it
out
my
guess
was
that
my
long
record
of
service
for
the
eggwe
could
withstand
some
variation
an
application
for
release
would
very
likely
win
an
approval
especially
in
view
of
my
change
to
serve
the
eggwe
purposes
even
better
by
becoming
a
benzendella
when
i
announced
this
plan
by
radio
to
the
new
captain
campbell
formerly
known
as
split
but
now
commonly
referred
to
on
this
planet
as
the
hero
of
the
benzendella
migration
he
said
he
was
not
surprised
congratulations
linden
for
knowing
what
you
wanted
stay
aboard
that
there
a
beautiful
land
waiting
for
you
up
ahead
