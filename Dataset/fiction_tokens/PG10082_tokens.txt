he
scrutinised
keenly
a
sheet
of
paper
which
lay
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
it
was
a
flimsy
sheet
from
a
cheap
blotted
and
soiled
and
covered
with
sprawling
letters
which
had
been
roughly
printed
at
irregular
intervals
as
though
to
hide
the
identity
of
the
writer
but
the
letters
formed
words
and
the
words
read

inspector
seldon
gave
expression
to
his
surprise
in
a
long
low
whistle
which
travelled
through
the
telephone

he
added
after
a
moment
reflection

house
while
he
was
away
there
was
a
pause
at
the
scotland
yard
end
of
the
telephone
inspector
chippenfield
was
evidently
thinking
hard

hoaxed

said
at
length

been
ringing

inspector
seldon
hung
up
the
receiver
of
his
telephone
bundled
up
the
papers
scattered
on
his
desk
closed
it
and
stepped
out
of
his
office
into
the
next
room
anyone
about
he
hurriedly
asked
the
sergeant
who
was
making
entries
in
the
yes
sir
i
saw
flack
here
a
moment
ago
get
him
at
once
and
call
a
taxi

yard
rung
through
to
say
they
received
a
report
that
sir
horace
fewbanks
has
been
murdered
murdered
echoed
the
sergeant
in
a
tone
of
keen
interest
who
told
scotland
yard
that
i
do
know
who
was
on
that
beat
last
night
flack
sir
was
sir
horace
murdered
in
his
own
house
i
thought
he
was
in
scotland
so
did
i
but
he
may
have
returned
ah
here
the
taxi
inspector
seldon
had
been
waiting
on
the
steps
for
the
appearance
of
a
cab
from
the
rank
round
the
corner
in
response
to
the
shrill
blast
which
the
sergeant
had
blown
on
his
whistle
the
sergeant
went
to
the
door
of
the
station
leading
into
the
yard
and
sharply
called
flack
in
response
a
without
helmet
or
tunic
came
running
up
the
steps
from
the
basement
which
was
used
as
a
gymnasium
seldon
wants
you
get
on
your
tunic
as
quick
as
you
can
he
is
in
a
devil
of
a
hurry
inspector
seldon
was
seated
in
the
when
flack
appeared
he
had
been
impatiently
drumming
his
fingers
on
the
door
of
the
cab
jump
in
man
he
said
angrily
what
has
kept
you
all
this
time
flack
breathed
stertorously
to
show
that
he
had
been
running
and
was
out
of
breath
but
he
made
no
reply
to
the
official
rebuke
inspector
seldon
turned
to
him
and
remarked
severely
why
did
you
let
me
know
that
sir
horace
fewbanks
had
returned
from
scotland
flack
looked
astonished
but
he
has
returned
sir
he
said
he
away
for
a
month
at
least
he
ventured
to
add
who
told
you
that
the
housemaid
at
riversbrook
before
he
went
away
h
the
inspector
next
question
contained
a
moral
rebuke
rather
than
an
official
one
you
a
married
man
flack
yes
sir
so
the
housemaid
told
you
he
was
going
away
for
a
month
well
she
ought
to
know
when
did
she
tell
you
a
week
ago
yesterday
sir
she
told
me
that
all
the
servants
except
the
butler
were
going
down
to
dellmere
the
next
day
that
is
sir
country
place
and
that
sir
horace
was
going
to
scotland
for
the
shooting
and
would
put
in
some
weeks
at
dellmere
after
the
shooting
season
was
over
and
are
you
sure
he
has
returned
quite
sir
i
saw
hill
the
butler
only
yesterday
morning
and
he
told
me
that
his
master
was
sure
to
be
in
scotland
for
at
least
a
month
longer
it
very
strange
muttered
the
inspector
half
to
himself
it
will
be
a
deuced
awkward
situation
to
face
if
scotland
yard
has
been
hoaxed
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
is
there
anything
wrong
about
sir
horace
yes
scotland
yard
has
received
a
report
that
he
has
been
murdered
flack
surprise
was
so
great
that
it
lifted
the
lid
of
official
humility
which
habitually
covered
his
natural
feelings
murdered
he
exclaimed
sir
horace
fewbanks
murdered
you
do
say
so
but
i
do
say
so
i
just
said
so
retorted
inspector
seldon
irritably
he
was
angry
at
the
fact
that
the
information
whether
true
or
false
had
gone
direct
to
scotland
yard
instead
of
reaching
him
first
when
was
he
murdered
sir
asked
flack
last
night
when
you
were
on
that
beat
flack
paled
at
this
remark
last
night
sir
he
cried
do
repeat
my
words
like
a
parrot
ejaculated
the
inspector
peevishly
did
you
notice
anything
suspicious
when
you
were
along
there
no
sir
was
he
murdered
in
his
own
house
his
dead
body
is
supposed
to
be
lying
there
now
in
the
library
said
inspector
seldon
how
scotland
yard
got
wind
of
it
is
more
than
i
know
we
ought
to
have
heard
of
it
before
them
how
many
times
did
you
go
along
there
last
night
twice
sir
about
eleven
and
then
about
three
and
there
was
nothing
suspicious
you
saw
no
one
i
saw
roberts
and
his
lady
coming
home
from
the
theatre
but
he
lives
at
the
other
end
of
tanton
gardens
and
i
saw
the
housemaid
at
mr
fielding
come
out
to
the
that
was
a
few
minutes
after
eleven
i
did
see
anybody
at
all
the
second
time
nobody
at
the
judge
place
no
taxi
or
anything
like
that
no
sir
the
turned
swiftly
into
the
shady
avenue
of
tanton
gardens
where
sir
horace
fewbanks
lived
and
in
a
few
moments
pulled
up
outside
of
riversbrook
the
house
stood
a
long
way
back
from
the
road
in
its
own
grounds
inspector
seldon
and
flack
passed
rapidly
through
the
grounds
and
reached
the
front
door
of
the
mansion
there
was
nobody
about
the
place
seemed
deserted
and
the
blinds
were
down
on
the
windows
inspector
seldon
knocked
loudly
at
the
front
door
with
the
big
brass
knocker
and
rang
the
bell
he
listened
intently
for
a
response
but
no
sound
followed
except
the
sharp
note
of
the
electric
bell
as
flack
rang
it
again
while
inspector
seldon
bent
down
with
his
ear
at
the
keyhole
then
the
inspector
stepped
back
and
regarded
the
house
keenly
for
a
moment
or
two
put
your
finger
on
that
bell
and
keep
on
ringing
it
flack
he
said
suddenly
i
see
that
some
of
the
blinds
are
down
but
there
one
on
the
first
floor
which
is
partly
up
it
looks
as
though
the
house
had
been
shut
up
and
somebody
had
come
back
unexpectedly
perhaps
it
hill
the
butler
said
flack
if
he
inside
he
ought
to
answer
the
bell
but
keep
on
ringing
while
i
knock
again
the
heavy
brass
knocker
again
reverberated
on
the
thick
oak
door
and
inspector
seldon
placed
his
ear
against
the
keyhole
to
ascertain
if
any
sound
was
to
be
heard
take
your
finger
off
that
bell
flack
he
commanded
i
can
not
hear
whether
anybody
is
coming
or
not
he
remained
in
a
listening
attitude
for
half
a
minute
and
then
plied
the
knocker
again
again
he
listened
for
footsteps
within
the
house
ring
again
flack
keep
on
ringing
while
i
go
round
the
house
to
see
if
there
is
any
way
i
can
get
in
i
may
have
to
break
a
window
do
move
from
here
inspector
seldon
went
quickly
round
the
side
of
the
house
trying
the
windows
as
he
went
towards
the
rear
of
the
house
on
the
west
side
he
came
across
a
curious
abutment
of
masonry
jutting
out
squarely
from
the
wall
on
the
other
side
of
this
abutment
which
gave
the
house
something
of
an
unfinished
appearance
were
three
french
windows
close
together
the
blinds
of
these
windows
were
closely
drawn
but
the
inspector
keen
eye
detected
that
one
of
the
catches
had
been
broken
and
there
were
marks
of
some
instrument
on
the
outside
woodwork
this
looks
like
business
he
muttered
he
pulled
open
the
window
and
walked
into
the
room
the
light
of
an
afternoon
sun
showed
him
that
the
apartment
was
a
breakfast
room
well
and
solidly
furnished
in
an
way
with
most
of
the
furniture
in
covers
as
though
the
occupants
of
the
house
were
away
the
daylight
penetrated
to
the
door
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
it
was
wide
open
and
revealed
an
empty
passage
inspector
seldon
walked
into
the
passage
the
drawn
blinds
made
the
passage
seem
quite
dark
after
the
bright
august
sunshine
outside
but
he
produced
an
electric
torch
and
by
its
light
he
saw
that
the
passage
ran
into
the
main
hall
his
footsteps
echoed
in
the
empty
house
the
electric
bell
rang
continuously
as
flack
pressed
it
outside
inspector
seldon
walked
along
the
passage
to
the
hall
flashing
his
torch
into
each
room
he
passed
he
saw
nothing
and
went
to
the
front
door
to
admit
flack
that
is
enough
of
that
noise
flack
he
said
come
inside
and
help
me
search
the
house
above
it
empty
on
this
floor
so
far
as
i
been
over
it
if
you
find
anything
call
me
and
mind
you
do
not
touch
anything
where
did
you
say
the
library
was
i
do
know
sir
well
look
about
you
on
the
ground
floor
while
i
go
upstairs
call
me
if
you
hear
anything
inspector
seldon
mounted
the
stairs
swiftly
in
order
to
continue
his
search
the
staircase
was
a
wide
one
with
broad
shallow
steps
thickly
carpeted
and
a
handsome
carved
mahogany
baluster
the
inspector
flashing
his
torch
as
he
ran
up
saw
a
small
electric
light
niche
in
the
wall
before
he
reached
the
first
landing
the
catch
of
the
light
was
underneath
and
inspector
seldon
turned
it
on
the
light
revealed
that
the
stairs
swept
round
at
that
point
to
the
landing
of
the
first
floor
which
was
screened
from
view
by
heavy
velvet
hangings
partly
caught
back
by
the
bent
arm
of
a
marble
figure
of
diana
which
faced
downstairs
with
its
other
arm
upraised
and
about
to
launch
a
hunting
spear
by
this
graceful
device
the
curtains
were
drawn
back
sufficiently
to
give
access
to
the
corridor
on
the
first
floor
inspector
seldon
looked
closely
at
the
figure
and
the
hangings
something
strange
about
the
former
arrested
his
eye
it
was
standing
awry
on
its
pedestal
was
indeed
almost
toppling
over
he
looked
up
and
saw
that
one
of
the
curtains
supported
by
the
arm
hung
loosely
from
one
of
the
curtain
rings
it
was
as
though
some
violent
hand
had
torn
at
the
curtain
in
passing
almost
dragging
it
from
the
pole
and
precipitating
the
figure
down
the
stairs
immediately
beyond
the
landing
in
the
corridor
was
a
door
on
the
right
flung
wide
open
the
inspector
entered
the
room
with
the
open
door
it
was
a
large
room
forming
part
of
the
front
of
the
house
a
lofty
large
room
partly
lighted
by
the
blind
of
one
of
the
windows
one
side
was
lined
with
bookshelves
in
the
corner
of
the
room
farthest
from
the
door
was
a
desk
which
was
open
in
the
centre
of
the
room
was
a
table
and
a
huddled
up
figure
was
lying
beside
it
in
a
dark
pool
of
blood
which
had
oozed
into
the
carpet
the
inspector
stepped
quickly
back
to
the
landing
flack
he
called
and
unconsciously
his
voice
dropped
to
a
sharp
whisper
in
the
presence
of
death
flack
come
here
when
flack
reached
the
door
of
the
library
he
saw
his
chief
kneeling
beside
the
prostrate
body
of
a
dead
man
the
body
lay
clear
of
the
table
near
the
foot
of
an
instinctively
flack
walked
on
tiptoe
to
his
chief
is
he
dead
sir
he
asked
cold
and
stiff
replied
the
inspector
in
a
hushed
voice
he
been
dead
for
hours
flack
noted
that
the
body
was
fully
dressed
and
he
saw
a
dark
stain
above
the
breast
where
the
blood
had
welled
forth
and
soaked
the
dead
man
clothes
and
formed
a
pool
on
the
carpet
beside
him
inspector
seldon
opened
the
dead
man
clothes
over
his
heart
he
found
the
wound
from
which
the
blood
had
flowed
there
it
is
flack
he
said
touching
the
wound
lightly
with
his
finger
it
does
take
a
big
wound
to
kill
a
man
as
he
spoke
the
sharp
ring
of
a
telephone
bell
from
downstairs
reached
them
that
inspector
chippenfield
said
inspector
seldon
rising
to
his
feet
stay
here
flack
till
i
go
and
speak
to
him
chapter
ii
edition
high
court
judge
murdered
it
was
not
quite
but
the
enterprising
section
of
the
london
evening
newspapers
had
their
editions
on
sale
in
the
streets
to
such
a
pitch
had
the
policy
of
giving
the
public
what
it
wants
been
elevated
that
the
halfpenny
newspapers
were
able
to
give
the
people
of
london
the
news
each
afternoon
a
full
ninety
minutes
before
the
edition
was
supposed
to
have
left
the
press
the
time
of
the
edition
was
boldly
printed
in
the
top
corner
of
each
paper
as
a
guarantee
of
enterprise
if
not
of
good
faith
on
practical
enterprise
of
this
kind
does
journalism
forge
ahead
some
people
who
have
been
bred
up
in
a
conservative
atmosphere
sneer
at
such
journalistic
enterprise
they
affect
to
regard
as
unreliable
the
news
contained
in
newspapers
which
are
unable
to
tell
the
truth
about
the
hands
of
the
clock
from
the
cries
of
the
and
from
the
announcements
on
the
newspaper
bills
which
they
displayed
it
was
assumed
by
those
with
a
greedy
appetite
for
sensations
that
a
judge
of
the
high
court
had
been
murdered
on
the
bench
such
an
appetite
easily
swallowed
the
difficulty
created
by
the
fact
that
the
law
courts
had
been
closed
for
the
long
vacation
in
imagination
they
saw
a
dramatic
scene
in
court
the
disappointed
demented
desperate
litigant
suddenly
drawing
a
revolver
and
with
unerring
aim
shooting
the
judge
through
the
brain
before
the
deadly
weapon
could
be
wrenched
from
his
hands
but
though
the
sensation
created
by
the
murder
of
a
judge
of
the
high
court
was
destined
to
grow
and
to
be
fed
by
unexpected
developments
the
changing
phases
of
which
monopolised
public
attention
throughout
england
on
successive
occasions
there
was
little
in
the
evening
papers
to
satisfy
the
appetite
for
sensation
in
journalistic
vernacular
they
were
late
in
getting
on
to
it
and
therefore
their
reference
to
the
crime
occupied
only
a
few
lines
in
the
stop
press
news
beneath
some
late
results
the
courier
which
was
first
in
the
streets
with
the
news
made
its
announcement
of
the
crime
in
the
following
brief
paragraph
the
dead
body
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
the
distinguished
high
court
judge
was
found
by
the
police
at
his
home
riversbrook
in
tanton
gardens
hampstead
deceased
had
been
shot
through
the
heart
the
police
have
no
doubt
that
he
was
murdered
but
the
morning
papers
of
the
following
day
did
full
justice
to
the
sensation
it
was
the
month
of
august
when
parliament
is
up
the
law
courts
closed
for
the
long
vacation
and
when
everybody
who
is
anybody
is
out
of
london
for
the
summer
holidays
news
was
scarce
and
the
papers
vied
with
one
another
in
making
the
utmost
of
the
murder
of
a
high
court
judge
each
of
the
morning
papers
sent
out
a
man
to
hampstead
soon
after
the
news
of
the
crime
reached
their
offices
in
the
afternoon
and
some
of
the
more
enterprising
sent
two
or
three
men
scotland
yard
and
riversbrook
were
visited
by
a
succession
of
pressmen
representing
the
london
dailies
the
provincial
press
and
the
news
agencies
the
two
points
on
which
the
newspaper
accounts
of
the
tragedy
laid
stress
were
the
mysterious
letter
which
had
been
sent
to
scotland
yard
stating
that
sir
horace
fewbanks
had
been
murdered
and
the
mystery
surrounding
the
sudden
return
of
sir
horace
from
scotland
to
his
town
house
on
the
first
point
there
was
room
for
much
varied
speculation
why
was
information
about
the
murder
sent
to
scotland
yard
and
why
was
it
sent
in
a
disguised
way
if
the
person
who
had
sent
this
letter
had
no
connection
with
the
crime
and
was
anxious
to
help
the
police
why
had
he
not
gone
to
scotland
yard
personally
and
told
the
detectives
all
he
knew
about
the
tragedy
if
on
the
other
hand
he
was
implicated
in
the
crime
why
had
he
informed
the
police
at
all
it
would
have
been
to
his
interest
as
an
accomplice
even
if
he
had
been
an
unwilling
accomplice
to
leave
the
crime
undiscovered
as
long
as
possible
so
that
he
and
those
with
whom
he
had
been
associated
might
make
their
escape
to
another
country
but
he
had
sent
his
letter
to
scotland
yard
within
a
few
hours
of
the
perpetration
of
the
crime
and
had
not
given
the
actual
murderer
time
to
get
out
of
england
was
he
not
afraid
of
the
vengeance
the
actual
murderer
would
endeavour
to
exact
for
this
disclosure
which
would
enable
the
police
to
take
measures
to
prevent
his
escape
no
light
was
thrown
on
the
cause
of
the
murdered
man
sudden
return
from
in
scotland
the
newspaper
accounts
though
they
differed
greatly
in
their
statements
surmises
and
suggestions
concerning
the
tragedy
agreed
on
the
point
that
sir
horace
had
been
a
keen
sportsman
and
was
a
very
fine
shot
in
years
past
he
had
made
a
practice
of
spending
the
early
part
of
the
long
vacation
in
scotland
going
there
for
the
opening
of
the
grouse
season
on
the
of
august
this
year
he
had
been
one
of
a
party
of
five
who
had
rented
craigleith
hall
in
the
western
highlands
and
after
five
days
shooting
he
had
announced
that
he
had
to
go
to
london
on
urgent
business
but
would
return
in
the
course
of
a
week
or
less
it
was
suggested
in
some
of
the
newspaper
accounts
that
an
explanation
of
the
cause
of
his
return
might
throw
some
light
on
the
murder
inquiries
were
being
made
at
craigleith
hall
to
ascertain
the
reason
for
his
journey
to
london
or
whether
any
telegram
had
been
received
by
him
previous
to
his
departure
the
fact
that
one
of
the
windows
on
the
ground
floor
of
riversbrook
had
been
found
open
was
regarded
as
evidence
that
the
murderer
had
broken
into
the
house
imprints
of
footsteps
had
been
found
in
the
ground
outside
the
window
and
the
police
had
taken
several
casts
of
these
but
whether
the
man
who
had
broken
into
the
house
with
the
intention
of
committing
burglary
or
murder
was
a
matter
on
which
speculation
differed
if
the
murderer
was
a
criminal
who
had
broken
into
the
house
with
the
intention
of
committing
a
burglary
there
could
be
no
connection
between
the
return
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
from
scotland
and
his
murder
the
burglary
had
probably
been
arranged
in
the
belief
that
the
house
was
empty
sir
horace
having
sent
the
servants
away
to
his
country
house
in
dellmere
a
week
before
but
if
the
murderer
was
a
burglar
he
had
stolen
nothing
and
had
not
even
collected
any
articles
for
removal
the
only
thing
that
was
known
to
be
missing
was
the
dead
man
but
there
was
nothing
to
prove
that
the
murderer
had
stolen
it
it
was
quite
possible
that
it
had
been
lost
or
mislaid
by
sir
horace
it
was
even
possible
that
it
had
been
stolen
from
him
in
the
train
during
his
journey
from
scotland
it
might
be
that
while
prowling
through
the
rooms
after
breaking
into
the
house
and
before
he
had
collected
any
goods
for
removal
the
burglar
had
come
unexpectedly
on
sir
horace
and
after
shooting
him
had
fled
from
the
house
only
as
a
last
resort
to
prevent
capture
did
burglars
commit
murder
had
sir
horace
been
shot
while
attempting
to
seize
the
intruder
the
position
in
which
the
body
was
found
did
not
support
that
theory
two
shots
had
been
fired
the
first
of
which
had
missed
its
victim
and
entered
the
wall
of
the
library
evidently
the
murdered
man
had
been
hit
by
the
second
while
attempting
to
leave
the
room
it
was
ingeniously
suggested
by
the
that
the
murderer
was
a
criminal
who
knew
sir
horace
and
was
known
to
him
as
a
man
who
had
been
before
him
at
old
bailey
this
would
account
for
sir
horace
being
ruthlessly
shot
down
without
having
made
any
attempt
to
seize
the
intruder
the
burglar
would
have
felt
on
seeing
sir
horace
in
the
room
that
he
was
identified
and
that
the
only
way
of
escaping
ultimate
arrest
by
the
police
was
to
kill
the
man
who
could
put
the
police
on
his
track
justice
fewbanks
had
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
somewhat
severe
judge
and
it
was
possible
that
some
of
the
criminals
who
had
been
sentenced
by
him
at
old
bailey
entertained
a
grudge
against
him
the
question
of
when
the
murder
was
committed
was
regarded
as
important
slingsby
of
the
home
office
who
had
examined
the
body
shortly
after
it
was
discovered
by
the
police
was
of
opinion
that
death
had
taken
place
at
least
twelve
hours
before
and
probably
longer
than
that
his
opinion
on
this
point
lent
support
to
the
theory
that
the
murder
had
been
committed
before
midnight
on
wednesday
it
was
the
that
seized
on
the
mystery
contained
in
the
facts
that
the
body
when
discovered
was
fully
clothed
and
that
the
electric
lights
were
not
turned
on
if
the
murder
was
committed
late
at
night
how
came
it
that
there
were
no
lights
in
the
empty
house
when
the
police
discovered
the
body
had
the
murderer
after
shooting
his
victim
turned
out
the
lights
so
that
on
the
following
day
no
suspicion
would
be
created
as
would
be
the
case
if
anyone
saw
lights
burning
in
the
house
in
the
if
he
had
done
so
he
was
a
cool
hand
but
if
the
burglar
was
such
a
cool
hand
as
to
stop
to
turn
out
the
lights
after
the
murder
why
did
he
not
also
stop
to
collect
some
valuables
was
he
afraid
that
in
attempting
to
get
rid
of
them
to
a
fence
or
drop
he
would
practically
reveal
himself
as
the
murderer
and
so
place
himself
in
danger
in
case
the
police
offered
a
reward
for
the
apprehension
of
the
author
of
the
crime
if
sir
horace
had
gone
to
bed
before
the
murderer
entered
the
house
it
would
have
been
natural
to
expect
no
lights
turned
on
but
he
had
returned
unexpectedly
there
were
no
servants
in
the
house
and
there
was
no
bed
ready
for
him
in
any
case
if
he
intended
stopping
in
the
empty
house
instead
of
going
to
a
hotel
he
would
have
been
wearing
a
sleeping
suit
when
his
body
was
discovered
or
at
most
he
would
be
only
partially
dressed
if
he
had
got
up
on
hearing
somebody
moving
about
the
house
but
the
body
was
fully
dressed
even
to
collar
and
tie
it
was
absurd
to
suppose
that
the
victim
had
been
sitting
in
the
darkness
when
the
murderer
appeared
another
difficult
problem
scotland
yard
had
to
face
was
the
discovery
of
the
person
who
had
sent
them
the
news
of
the
murder
how
had
scotland
yard
anonymous
correspondent
learned
about
the
murder
and
what
were
his
motives
in
informing
the
police
in
the
way
he
had
done
was
he
connected
with
the
crime
had
the
murderer
a
companion
with
him
when
he
broke
into
riversbrook
for
the
purpose
of
burglary
that
seemed
to
be
the
most
probable
explanation
the
second
man
had
been
horrified
at
the
murder
and
desired
to
disassociate
himself
from
it
so
that
he
might
escape
the
gallows
the
only
alternative
was
to
suppose
that
the
murderer
had
confessed
his
crime
to
some
one
and
that
his
confidant
had
lost
no
time
in
informing
the
police
of
the
tragedy
the
newspaper
accounts
of
the
case
threw
some
light
on
the
private
and
domestic
affairs
of
the
victim
he
was
a
widower
with
a
daughter
his
wife
a
daughter
of
the
late
sir
james
goldsworthy
who
changed
his
ancient
family
patronymic
from
granville
to
goldsworthy
on
inheriting
the
great
fortune
of
an
american
kinsman
had
died
eight
years
before

of
a
housekeeper

and

with
the
exception
of
the
butler
the
servants
had
been
sent
the
previous
week
to
sir
horace
country
house
in
dellmere
sussex
it
appeared
that
miss
fewbanks
spent
most
of
her
time
at
the
country
house
and
came
up
to
london
but
rarely
she
was
at
dellmere
when
the
murder
was
committed
and
had
been
under
the
impression
that
her
father
was
in
scotland
according
to
a
report
received
from
the
police
at
dellmere
the
first
intimation
that
miss
fewbanks
had
received
of
the
tragic
death
of
her
father
came
from
them
naturally
she
was
prostrated
with
grief
at
the
tragedy
the
butler
who
had
been
left
behind
in
charge
of
riversbrook
was
a
man
named
hill
but
he
was
not
in
the
house
on
the
night
of
the
tragedy
he
was
a
married
man
and
his
wife
and
child
lived
in
camden
town
where
hill
kept
a
confectionery
shop

master
had
given
him
permission
to
live
at
home
for
three
weeks
while
he
was
in
scotland
the
house
in
tanton
gardens
had
been
locked
up
and
most
of
the
valuables
had
been
sent
to
the
bank
for
but
there
were
enough
portable

value
in

for

hill
had
instructions
to
visit
the
house
three
times
a
week
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
that
everything
was
safe
and
in
order
he
had
inspected
the
place
on
wednesday
morning
and
everything
was
as
it
had
been
left
when
his
master
went
to
scotland
sir

had
returned
to
london
on
wednesday
evening
reaching
pancras
by
the
train
hill
was
unaware
that
his
master
was
returning
and
the
first
he
learned
of
the
murder
was
the
brief
announcement
in
the
evening
papers
on
thursday
chapter
iii
inspector
chippenfield
who
had
come
into
prominence
in
the
newspapers
as
the
man
who
had
caught
the
gang
who
had
stolen
lady
jewels
which
included
the
most
costly
pearl
necklace
in
the
world
was
placed
in
charge
of
the
case
it
was
to
his
success
in
this
famous
case
that
he
owed
his
promotion
to
inspector
he
had
the
assistance
of
his
subordinate
detective
rolfe
so
generous
were
the
newspaper
references
to
the
acumen
of
these
two
terrors
of
the
criminal
classes
that
it
was
to
be
assumed
that
anything
which
inadvertently
escaped
one
of
them
would
be
pounced
upon
by
the
other
on
the
morning
after
the
discovery
of
the
murdered
man
body
the
two
officers
made
their
way
to
tanton
gardens
from
the
hampstead
tube
station
inspector
chippenfield
was
a
stout
man
of
middle
age
with
a
red
face
the
colour
of
which
seemed
to
be
accentuated
by
the
daily
operation
of
removing
every
vestige
of
hair
from
it
he
had
prominent
grey
eyes
with
which
he
was
accustomed
to
stare
fiercely
when
he
desired
to
impress
a
suspected
person
with
what
some
of
the
newspapers
had
referred
to
as
his
penetrating
glance
his
companion
rolfe
was
a
tall
man
in
the
early
thirties
like
most
men
in
a
subordinate
position
rolfe
had
not
a
high
opinion
of
the
abilities
of
his
immediate
superiors
he
was
sure
that
he
could
fill
the
place
of
any
one
of
them
better
than
it
was
filled
by
its
occupant
he
believed
that
it
was
the
policy
of
superiors
to
keep
junior
men
back
to
stand
in
their
light
and
to
take
all
the
credit
for
their
work
he
was
confident
that
he
was
destined
to
make
a
name
for
himself
in
the
detective
world
if
only
he
were
given
the
chance
when
inspector
chippenfield
had
visited
riversbrook
the
previous
afternoon
rolfe
had
not
been
selected
as
his
assistant
a
careful
inspection
of
the
house
and
especially
of
the
room
in
which
the
tragedy
had
been
committed
had
been
made
by
the
inspector
he
had
then
turned
his
attention
to
the
garden
and
the
grounds
surrounding
the
house
whatever
he
had
discovered
and
what
theories
he
had
formed
were
not
disclosed
to
anyone
not
even
his
assistant
he
believed
that
the
proper
way
to
train
a
subordinate
was
to
let
him
collect
his
own
information
and
then
test
it
for
him
this
method
enabled
him
to
profit
by
his
subordinate
efforts
and
to
display
a
superior
knowledge
when
the
other
propounded
a
theory
by
which
inspector
chippenfield
had
also
been
misled
when
they
arrived
at
the
house
in
which
the
crime
had
been
committed
they
found
a
small
crowd
of
people
ranging
from
feeble
old
women
to
babies
in
arms
and
including
a
large
proportion
of
boys
and
girls
of
school
age
collected
outside
the
gates
staring
intently
through
the
bars
towards
the
house
which
was
almost
hidden
by
trees
the
morbid
crowd
made
way
for
the
two
officers
and
speculated
on
their
mission
the
general
impression
was
that
they
were
the
representatives
of
a
fashionable
firm
of
undertakers
and
had
come
to
measure
the
victim
for
his
coffin
inside
the
grounds
the
scotland
yard
officers
encountered
a
who
was
on
guard
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
inquisitive
strangers
penetrating
to
the
house
well
flack
said
inspector
chippenfield
in
a
tone
in
which
geniality
was
slightly
blended
with
official
superiority
how
are
you
i
very
well
indeed
sir
replied
the
he
knew
that
the
state
of
his
health
was
not
a
matter
of
deep
concern
to
the
inspector
but
such
is
the
vanity
of
human
nature
that
he
was
pleased
at
the
inquiry
the
fact
that
there
was
a
murdered
man
in
the
house
gave
mournful
emphasis
to
the
transience
of
human
life
and
made
flack
feel
a
glow
of
satisfaction
in
being
very
well
indeed
inspector
chippenfield
hesitated
a
moment
as
if
in
deep
thought
the
object
of
his
hesitation
was
to
give
flack
an
opportunity
of
imparting
any
information
that
had
come
to
him
while
on
guard
the
inspector
believed
in
encouraging
people
to
impart
information
but
regarded
it
as
subversive
of
the
respect
due
to
him
to
appear
to
be
in
need
of
any
as
flack
made
no
attempt
to
carry
the
conversation
beyond
the
state
of
his
health
inspector
chippenfield
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
an
extremely
dull
policeman
he
introduced
flack
to
detective
rolfe
and
explained
to
the
latter
flack
was
on
duty
on
the
night
of
the
murder
but
heard
no
shots
probably
he
was
a
mile
or
so
away
but
in
a
way
he
discovered
the
crime
did
you
flack
when
we
rang
up
seldon
he
came
up
here
and
brought
flack
with
him
he
be
only
too
glad
to
tell
you
anything
you
want
to
know
rolfe
took
an
official
notebook
from
a
breast
pocket
and
proceeded
to
question
the
the
inspector
made
his
way
upstairs
to
the
room
in
which
the
crime
had
been
committed
for
it
was
his
system
to
seek
inspiration
in
the
scene
of
a
crime
tanton
gardens
a
short
private
street
terminating
in
a
was
in
a
remote
part
of
hampstead
the
daylight
appearance
of
the
street
betokened
wealth
and
exclusiveness
the
roadway
which
ran
between
its
broad
footwalks
was
smoothly
asphalted
for
motor
tyres
the
avenues
of
great
chestnut
trees
which
flanked
the
footpaths
served
the
dual
purpose
of
affording
shade
in
summer
and
screening
the
houses
of
tanton
gardens
from
view
but
after
nightfall
tanton
gardens
was
a
lonely
and
gloomy
place
lighted
only
by
one
lamp
which
stood
in
the
high
road
more
to
mark
the
entrance
to
the
street
than
as
a
guide
to
traffic
along
it
for
its
rays
barely
penetrated
beyond
the
first
pair
of
chestnut
trees
the
houses
in
tanton
gardens
were
in
keeping
with
the
street
they
indicated
wealth
and
comfort
they
were
of
solid
exterior
of
a
size
that
suggested
a
fine
roominess
and
each
house
stood
in
its
own
grounds
riversbrook
was
the
last
house
at
the
blind
end
of
the
street
and
its
east
windows
looked
out
on
a
wood
which
sloped
down
to
a
valley
the
street
having
originally
been
an
incursion
into
a
large
private
estate
of
which
the
wood
alone
remained
on
the
other
side
a
tangled
nutwood
coppice
separated
the
judge
residence
from
its
nearest
neighbours
so
the
house
was
completely
isolated
it
stood
well
back
in
about
four
acres
of
ground
and
only
a
glimpse
of
it
could
be
seen
from
the
street
front
because
of
a
small
plantation
of
ornamental
trees
which
grew
in
front
of
the
house
and
hid
it
almost
completely
from
view
when
the
carriage
drive
which
wound
through
the
plantation
had
been
passed
the
house
burst
abruptly
into
view
a
big
rambling
building
of
uncompromising
ugliness
its
architecture
was
remarkable
the
impression
which
it
conveyed
was
that
the
original
builder
had
been
prevented
by
lack
of
money
from
carrying
out
his
original
intention
of
erecting
a
fine
symmetrical
house
the
first
story
was
well
enough
an
imposing
massive
colonnaded
front
in
the
greek
style
with
marble
pillars
supporting
the
entrance
but
the
two
stories
surmounting
this
failed
lamentably
to
carry
on
the
pretentious
design
viewed
from
the
front
they
looked
as
though
the
builder
after
erecting
the
first
story
had
found
himself
in
pecuniary
straits
but
determined
to
finish
his
house
somehow
had
built
two
smaller
stories
on
the
solid
edifice
of
the
first
for
the
two
second
stories
were
not
flush
with
the
front
of
the
house
but
reared
themselves
from
several
feet
behind
so
that
the
occupants
of
the
bedrooms
on
the
first
story
could
have
used
the
intervening
space
as
a
balcony
viewed
from
the
rear
the
architectural
imperfections
of
the
upper
part
of
the
house
were
in
even
stronger
contrast
with
the
ornamental
first
story
apparently
the
impecunious
builder
by
the
time
he
had
reached
the
rear
had
completely
run
out
of
funds
for
on
the
third
floor
he
had
failed
altogether
to
build
in
one
small
room
and
had
left
the
unfinished
brickwork
unplastered
the
large
open
space
between
the
house
and
the
fir
plantation
had
once
been
laid
out
as
an
italian
garden
at
the
cost
of
much
time
and
money
but
sir
horace
fewbanks
had
lacked
the
taste
or
money
to
keep
it
up
and
had
allowed
it
to
become
a
luxuriant
wilderness
though
the
sloping
parterres
and
the
centre
flowerbeds
still
retained
traces
of
their
former
beauty
the
small
lake
in
the
centre
spanned
by
a
rustic
was
still
inhabited
by
a
few
specimens
of
the
carp
family
sole
survivors
of
the
numerous
with
which
the
original
designer
of
the
garden
had
stocked
the
lake
sir
horace
fewbanks
had
rented
riversbrook
as
a
town
house
for
some
years
before
his
death
having
acquired
the
lease
cheaply
from
the
previous
possessor
a
retired
indian
civil
servant
who
had
taken
a
dislike
to
the
place
because
his
wife
had
gone
insane
within
its
walls
sir
horace
had
lived
much
in
the
house
alone
though
each
london
season
his
daughter
spent
a
few
weeks
with
him
in
order
to
preside
over
the
few
society
functions
that
her
father
felt
it
due
to
his
position
to
give
and
which
generally
took
the
form
of
solemn
dinners
to
which
he
invited
some
of
his
brother
judges
a
few
eminent
barristers
a
few
political
friends
and
their
wives
but
rumour
had
whispered
that
the
judge
and
his
daughter
had
not
got
on
too
well
together
that
miss
fewbanks
was
a
strange
girl
who
did
not
care
for
society
or
the
society
functions
which
most
girls
of
her
age
would
have
delighted
in
but
preferred
to
spend
her
time
on
her
father
country
estate
taking
an
interest
in
the
villagers
or
walking
the
with
half
a
dozen
dogs
at
her
heels
rumour
had
not
spared
the
dead
judge
name
it
was
said
of
him
that
he
was
fond
of
ladies
society
and
especially
of
ladies
belonging
to
a
type
which
he
could
not
ask
his
daughter
to
meet
that
he
used
to
go
out
motoring
driving
himself
after
other
people
were
in
bed
and
that
strange
scenes
had
taken
place
at
riversbrook
flack
had
told
his
wife
on
several
occasions
that
he
had
heard
sounds
of
wild
laughter
and
rowdy
singing
coming
from
riversbrook
as
he
passed
along
the
street
on
his
beat
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
several
times
in
the
early
dawn
flack
had
seen
two
or
three
ladies
in
evening
dress
come
down
the
carriage
drive
and
enter
a
which
had
been
summoned
by
telephone
chapter
iv
when
rolfe
had
finished
questioning
flack
and
joined
his
chief
upstairs
the
latter
who
had
been
going
through
the
private
papers
in
the
murdered
man
desk
in
the
hope
of
alighting
on
a
clue
to
the
crime
received
him
genially
well
he
said
what
do
you
think
of
flack
rolfe
had
obtained
from
the
a
straightforward
story
of
what
he
had
seen
and
in
this
way
had
picked
up
some
useful
information
about
the
crime
which
it
would
have
taken
a
long
time
to
extract
from
the
inspector
but
he
was
a
sufficiently
good
detective
to
have
learned
that
by
disparaging
the
source
of
your
information
you
add
to
your
own
reputation
for
acumen
in
drawing
conclusions
in
regard
to
it
he
nodded
his
head
in
a
deprecating
way
and
emitted
a
slight
cough
which
was
meant
to
express
contempt
it
looks
very
much
like
a
case
of
burglary
and
murder
he
said
he
was
anxious
to
know
what
theory
his
superior
officer
had
formed
and
how
do
you
fit
in
the
letter
advising
us
of
the
murder
asked
the
inspector
he
produced
the
letter
from
his
and
looked
at
it
earnestly
there
were
two
of
them
in
it
one
a
savage
ruffian
who
will
stick
at
nothing
and
the
other
a
specimen
they
often
work
in
pairs
like
that
so
your
theory
is
that
one
of
the
two
shot
him
and
the
other
was
so
unnerved
that
he
sent
us
the
letter
and
put
us
on
the
track
to
save
his
own
neck
something
like
that
it
is
not
impossible
was
the
senior
officer
comment
mind
you
i
do
say
it
is
my
theory
in
fact
i
am
in
no
hurry
to
form
one
i
believe
in
going
carefully
over
the
whole
ground
first
collecting
all
the
clues
and
then
selecting
the
right
one
rolfe
admitted
that
his
chief
way
of
setting
to
work
to
solve
a
mystery
was
an
ideal
one
but
he
made
the
reservation
that
it
was
a
difficult
one
to
put
into
operation
he
was
convinced
that
the
only
way
of
finding
the
right
clue
was
to
follow
up
every
one
until
it
was
proved
to
be
a
wrong
one
inspector
chippenfield
continued
his
study
of
the
mysterious
message
which
had
been
sent
to
scotland
yard
it
was
written
on
a
sheet
of
paper
which
had
been
taken
from
a
writing
pad
of
the
kind
sold
for
a
few
pence
by
all
stationers
it
was
flimsy
and
and
the
message
it
contained
was
smudged
and
badly
printed
but
to
the
annoyance
there
were
no
on
the
paper
the
expert
at
scotland
yard
had
examined
it
under
the
microscope
but
his
search
for
had
been
vain
depend
upon
it
we
hear
from
this
chap
again
said
the
inspector
tapping
the
sheet
of
paper
with
a
finger
i
think
i
may
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
this
fellow
thinks
suspicion
will
be
directed
to
him
and
he
wants
to
save
his
neck
it
a
disguised
hand
said
rolfe
of
course
he
printed
it
in
order
not
to
give
us
a
specimen
of
his
handwriting
there
are
telltale
things
about
a
man
handwriting
which
give
him
away
even
when
he
tries
to
disguise
it
but
he
tried
to
disguise
even
his
printing
look
how
irregular
the
letters
are
some
slanting
to
the
right
and
some
to
the
left
and
some
are
upright
look
at
the
two
different
kinds
of
he
used
two
different
kinds
of
pens
said
inspector
chippenfield
look
at
the
difference
in
the
thickness
of
the
letters
the
sooner
he
writes
again
the
better
said
rolfe
i
am
curious
to
know
what
he
say
next
my
idea
is
to
find
out
who
he
is
and
make
him
speak
said
the
inspector
speaking
is
quicker
than
writing
i
could
frighten
more
out
of
him
in
ten
minutes
than
he
would
give
away
voluntarily
in
a
month
of
sundays
again
rolfe
had
to
admit
that
his
chief
plan
to
get
at
the
truth
was
an
ideal
one
have
you
any
idea
who
he
is
he
asked
inspector
chippenfield
had
brought
his
methods
too
near
to
perfection
to
make
it
possible
for
him
to
fall
into
an
open
trap
i
wo
be
very
long
putting
my
hand
on
him
he
said
but
this
thing
has
been
in
the
papers
said
rolfe
do
you
think
the
murderer
will
bolt
out
of
the
country
when
he
knows
his
mate
is
prepared
to
turn
king
evidence
against
him
ah
said
inspector
chippenfield
i
have
adopted
your
theory
then
you
think
that
the
man
who
wrote
this
note
knew
of
the
murder
but
does
know
who
did
it
now
you
are
going
too
far
said
inspector
chippenfield
the
inspector
was
so
wary
about
disclosing
what
was
in
his
mind
in
regard
to
the
letter
that
rolfe
who
disliked
his
chief
very
cordially
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
inspector
chippenfield
had
no
intelligible
ideas
concerning
it
if
it
was
burglars
they
took
nothing
as
far
as
we
can
ascertain
up
to
the
present
said
inspector
chippenfield
after
a
pause
they
were
surprised
to
find
anyone
in
the
house
and
after
the
shot
was
fired
they
immediately
bolted
for
fear
the
noise
would
attract
attention
what
knocks
a
hole
in
the
burglar
theory
is
the
fact
that
sir
horace
was
fully
dressed
when
he
was
shot
said
the
inspector
burglars
break
into
a
house
when
there
are
lights
about
especially
after
having
been
led
to
believe
that
the
house
was
empty
so
you
think
said
rolfe
that
the
window
was
forced
after
the
murder
with
the
object
of
misleading
us
i
have
said
so
replied
the
inspector
all
i
am
prepared
to
say
is
that
even
that
was
not
impossible
it
was
forced
from
the
outside
continued
rolfe
i
seen
the
marks
of
a
jemmy
on
the
if
it
was
forced
after
the
murder
the
murderer
was
a
cool
hand
you
can
take
it
from
me
exclaimed
inspector
chippenfield
with
unexpected
candour
that
he
was
a
cool
hand
we
are
going
to
have
a
bit
of
trouble
in
getting
to
the
bottom
of
this
rolfe
if
anyone
can
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
you
can
said
rolfe
who
believed
with
voltaire
that
speech
was
given
us
in
order
to
enable
us
to
conceal
our
thoughts
inspector
chippenfield
was
so
astonished
at
this
handsome
compliment
that
he
began
to
think
he
had
underrated
rolfe
powers
of
discernment
his
tone
of
cold
official
superiority
immediately
thawed
there
were
two
shots
fired
he
said
but
whether
both
were
fired
by
the
murderer
i
do
know
yet
one
of
them
may
have
been
fired
by
sir
horace
just
behind
you
in
the
wall
is
the
mark
of
one
of
the
bullets
i
dug
it
out
of
the
plaster
yesterday
and
here
it
is
he
produced
from
a
waistcoat
pocket
a
flattened
bullet
the
other
is
inside
him
at
present
he
waved
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
room
in
which
the
corpse
lay
of
course
you
can
not
say
yet
whether
both
bullets
are
out
of
the
same
revolver
said
rolfe
ca
tell
till
after
the
said
the
inspector
and
then
all
we
can
tell
for
certain
is
whether
they
are
of
the
same
pattern
they
might
be
the
same
size
and
yet
be
fired
out
of
different
revolvers
of
the
same
calibre
well
it
is
no
use
theorising
about
what
happened
in
this
room
until
after
the
said
rolfe
you
better
give
it
some
thought
suggested
the
inspector
in
the
meantime
i
want
you
to
interview
the
people
in
the
neighbourhood
and
ascertain
whether
they
heard
any
shots
they
all
say
they
did
whether
they
heard
them
or
not
you
know
how
people
persuade
themselves
into
imagining
things
so
as
to
get
some
sort
of
prominence
in
these
crimes
but
you
can
sift
what
they
tell
you
and
preserve
the
grain
of
truth
try
and
get
them
to
be
accurate
as
to
the
time
as
we
want
to
fix
the
time
of
the
crime
as
near
as
possible
ask
flack
to
tell
you
something
about
the
neighbours
he
been
in
this
district
fifteen
years
and
ought
to
know
all
about
them
while
you
away
i
go
through
these
private
papers
i
want
to
find
out
why
he
came
back
from
scotland
so
suddenly
if
we
knew
that
the
rest
might
be
easy
i
have
seen
the
body
yet
said
rolfe
i
like
to
look
at
it
where
is
it
i
had
it
removed
downstairs
you
will
find
it
in
a
big
room
on
the
left
as
you
go
down
the
hall
by
the
by
there
is
another
matter
rolfe
this
glove
was
found
in
the
room
it
may
be
a
clue
but
it
is
more
likely
that
it
is
one
of
sir
horace
gloves
and
that
he
lost
the
other
one
on
his
way
up
from
scotland
it
a
glove
men
always
lose
the
glove
because
they
take
it
off
so
often
i
compared
it
with
other
gloves
in
sir
horace
wardrobe
and
i
find
it
is
the
same
size
and
much
the
same
quality
but
find
out
from
sir
horace
hosier
if
he
sold
it
here
the
address
of
the
hosiers
bruden
and
marshall
in
the
strand
rolfe
went
slowly
downstairs
into
the
room
in
which
the
corpse
lay
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
it
was
a
very
large
room
overlooking
the
garden
on
the
right
side
of
the
house
somebody
had
lowered
the
venetian
blinds
as
a
conventional
intimation
to
the
outside
world
that
the
house
was
one
of
mourning
and
the
room
was
almost
dark
for
nearly
a
minute
rolfe
stood
in
silence
his
hand
resting
on
the
knob
of
the
door
he
had
closed
behind
him
gradually
the
outline
of
the
room
and
the
objects
within
it
began
to
reveal
themselves
in
shadowy
shape
as
his
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
dim
light
he
had
a
growing
impression
of
a
big
lofty
room
with
heavy
furniture
and
a
huddled
up
figure
lying
on
a
couch
at
the
end
furthest
from
the
window
and
deepest
in
shadow
he
stepped
across
to
the
window
and
gently
raised
one
of
the
blinds
the
light
of
an
august
sun
penetrated
through
the
screen
of
trees
in
front
of
the
house
and
revealed
the
interior
of
the
room
more
clearly
rolfe
was
amazed
at
its
size
from
the
window
to
the
couch
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
where
the
body
lay
was
nearly
thirty
feet
glancing
down
the
apartment
he
noticed
that
it
was
really
two
rooms
divided
in
the
middle
by
folding
doors
these
doors
folded
neatly
into
a
slightly
protruding
ridge
or
arch
almost
opposite
the
door
by
which
he
had
entered
and
were
screened
from
observation
by
heavy
damask
curtains
which
drooped
over
the
archway
slightly
into
the
room
evidently
the
deceased
judge
had
been
in
the
habit
of
using
the
divided
rooms
as
a
single
apartment
for
the
heavier
furniture
in
both
halves
of
it
was
of
the
same
pattern
the
chairs
and
tables
were
of
heavy
ponderous
make
and
they
were
matched
by
a
number
of
mahogany
sideboards
and
presses
arranged
methodically
at
regular
intervals
on
both
sides
of
the
room
rolfe
as
his
eye
took
in
these
articles
wondered
why
sir
horace
fewbanks
had
bought
so
many
one
sideboard
a
vast
piece
of
furniture
fully
eight
feet
long
had
a
whisky
decanter
and
siphon
of
soda
water
on
it
as
though
sir
horace
had
served
himself
with
refreshments
on
his
return
to
the
house
the
tops
of
the
other
sideboards
were
bare
and
the
presses
use
in
such
a
room
rolfe
was
at
a
loss
to
conjecture
were
locked
up
the
antique
sombre
uniformity
of
the
furniture
as
a
whole
was
broken
at
odd
intervals
by
several
articles
of
bizarre
modernity
including
a
few
daring
french
prints
which
struck
an
odd
note
of
incongruity
in
such
a
room
the
murdered
man
had
been
laid
on
an
sofa
at
the
end
of
this
double
apartment
which
was
furthest
from
the
window
rolfe
walked
slowly
over
the
thick
turkey
carpets
and
rugs
with
which
the
floor
was
covered
glanced
at
the
sofa
curiously
and
then
turned
down
the
sheet
from
the
dead
man
face
at
the
time
of
his
death
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
years
of
age
but
since
death
the
grey
bristles
had
grown
so
rapidly
through
his
face
that
he
looked
much
older
the
face
showed
none
of
the
wonted
placidity
of
death
the
mouth
was
twisted
in
an
ugly
fashion
as
though
the
murdered
man
had
endeavoured
to
cry
for
help
and
had
been
attacked
and
killed
while
doing
so
one
of
sir
horace
arms
the
right
one
was
thrust
forward
diagonally
across
his
breast
as
if
in
and
the
hand
was
tightly
clenched
rolfe
who
had
last
seen
his
honour
presiding
on
the
bench
in
the
full
pomp
and
majesty
of
law
felt
a
chill
strike
his
heart
at
the
fell
power
of
death
which
did
not
even
respect
the
person
of
a
high
court
judge
and
had
stripped
him
of
every
vestige
of
human
dignity
in
the
pangs
of
a
violent
end
the
face
he
had
last
seen
on
the
bench
full
of
wisdom
and
austerity
of
the
law
was
now
distorted
into
a
livid
mask
in
which
it
was
hard
to
trace
any
semblance
of
the
features
of
the
dead
judge
rolfe
official
alertness
of
mind
in
the
face
of
a
mysterious
crime
soon
reasserted
itself
however
and
he
shook
off
the
feeling
of
sentiment
and
proceeded
to
make
a
closer
examination
of
the
dead
body
as
he
turned
down
the
sheet
to
examine
the
wound
which
had
ended
the
judge
life
it
slipped
from
his
hand
and
fell
on
the
floor
revealing
that
the
judge
had
been
laid
on
the
couch
just
as
he
had
been
killed
fully
clothed
he
had
been
shot
through
the
body
near
the
heart
and
a
large
patch
of
blood
had
welled
from
the
wound
and
congealed
in
his
shirt
one
trouser
leg
was
ruffled
up
and
had
caught
in
the
top
of
the
boot
the
corpse
presented
a
repellent
spectacle
but
rolfe
who
had
seen
unpleasant
sights
of
various
kinds
in
his
career
bent
over
the
body
with
keen
interest
noting
these
details
with
all
his
professional
instincts
aroused
for
though
rolfe
had
not
yet
risen
very
high
in
the
police
force
he
had
many
of
the
qualities
which
make
the
good
detective
observation
sagacity
and
some
imagination
the
extraordinary
crime
which
he
had
been
called
upon
to
help
unravel
presented
a
baffling
mystery
which
was
likely
to
test
the
value
of
these
qualities
to
the
utmost
rolfe
looked
steadily
at
the
corpse
for
some
time
impressing
a
picture
of
it
in
every
detail
on
his
mental
retina
struck
by
an
idea
he
bent
over
and
touched
the
patch
of
blood
in
the
dead
man
breast
then
looked
at
his
finger
there
was
no
stain
the
blood
was
quite
congealed
then
he
tried
to
unclench
the
judge
right
hand
but
it
was
rigid
as
rolfe
stood
there
gazing
intently
at
the
corpse
and
trying
to
form
some
theory
of
the
reason
for
the
murder
certain
old
stories
he
had
heard
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
private
life
and
character
recurred
to
him
these
rumours
had
not
been
much
a
jocular
hint
or
two
among
his
fellows
at
scotland
yard
that
his
honour
had
a
weakness
for
a
pretty
face
and
in
private
life
led
a
less
decorous
existence
than
a
judge
ought
to
do
rolfe
wondered
how
much
or
how
little
truth
was
contained
in
these
stories
he
glanced
around
the
vast
room
certainly
it
was
not
the
sort
of
apartment
in
which
a
high
court
judge
might
be
expected
to
do
his
entertaining
but
rolfe
recalled
that
he
had
heard
gossip
to
the
effect
that
sir
horace
because
of
his
virtual
estrangement
from
his
daughter
did
very
little
entertaining
beyond
an
occasional
bridge
or
supper
party
to
his
sporting
friends
and
rarely
went
into
society
rolfe
began
to
scrutinise
the
articles
of
furniture
in
the
room
wondering
if
there
was
anything
about
them
which
might
reveal
something
of
the
habits
of
the
dead
man
he
produced
a
small
electric
torch
from
his
pocket
and
with
its
light
to
guide
him
in
the
room
he
closely
inspected
each
piece
of
furniture
then
with
the
torch
in
his
hand
he
returned
to
the
sofa
and
flashed
it
over
the
dead
body
he
started
violently
when
the
light
falling
on
the
dead
man
closed
hand
revealed
a
tiny
scrap
of
white
eagerly
he
endeavoured
to
release
the
fragment
from
the
tenacious
clutch
of
the
dead
without
tearing
it
and
eventually
he
managed
to
detach
it
his
heart
bounded
when
he
saw
that
it
was
a
small
torn
piece
of
lace
and
muslin
he
placed
it
in
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
and
examined
it
closely
under
the
light
of
his
torch
to
him
it
looked
to
be
part
of
a
fashionable
lady
dainty
handkerchief
he
was
elated
at
his
discovery
and
he
wondered
how
inspector
chippenfield
had
overlooked
it
then
the
explanation
struck
him
the
small
piece
of
lace
and
muslin
had
been
effectually
hidden
in
the
dead
man
clenched
hand
and
his
efforts
to
open
the
hand
had
loosened
it
well
rolfe
said
inspector
chippenfield
when
his
subordinate
reappeared
you
been
long
enough
to
have
unearthed
the
criminal
or
revived
the
corpse
have
you
discovered
anything
fresh
only
this
replied
rolfe
displaying
the
piece
of
handkerchief
the
find
startled
inspector
chippenfield
out
of
his
air
of
bantering
superiority
where
did
you
get
that
he
stammered
as
he
reached
out
eagerly
for
it
the
dead
man
had
it
clenched
in
his
right
hand
i
wondered
if
he
had
anything
hidden
in
his
hand
when
i
saw
it
so
tightly
clenched
i
tried
to
force
open
the
fingers
and
that
fell
out
inspector
chippenfield
was
by
no
means
pleased
at
his
discovery
of
what
promised
to
be
an
important
clue
especially
after
the
clue
had
been
missed
by
himself
but
he
congratulated
rolfe
in
a
tone
of
fictitious
heartiness
well
done
rolfe
he
exclaimed
you
are
coming
on
anyone
can
see
that
you
the
makings
of
a
good
detective
rolfe
could
afford
to
ignore
the
sting
contained
in
such
faint
praise
what
do
you
make
of
it
he
asked
looks
as
though
there
is
a
woman
in
it
said
the
inspector
who
was
still
examining
the
scrap
of
lace
and
muslin
there
ca
be
much
doubt
about
that
replied
rolfe
we
must
be
in
a
hurry
in
jumping
at
conclusions
remarked
the
inspector
no
and
we
must
ignore
obvious
facts
said
rolfe
you
think
a
woman
murdered
him
asked
the
inspector
i
think
a
woman
was
present
when
he
was
shot
whether
she
fired
the
shot
there
is
nothing
to
show
at
present
there
may
have
been
a
man
with
her
but
there
was
a
struggle
just
before
the
shot
was
fired
and
as
sir
horace
fell
he
grasped
at
the
hand
in
which
she
was
holding
her
handkerchief
or
perhaps
her
handkerchief
was
torn
in
his
dying
struggles
when
she
was
leaning
over
him
you
have
overlooked
the
possibility
of
this
having
been
placed
in
the
dying
man
hand
to
deceive
us
said
the
inspector
if
the
intention
was
to
mislead
us
it
would
have
been
placed
where
it
might
have
been
overlooked
as
the
inspector
had
overlooked
the
presence
of
the
scrap
of
handkerchief
in
the
dead
man
hand
he
felt
that
he
was
not
making
much
progress
with
the
work
of
keeping
his
subordinate
in
his
place
well
it
is
a
clue
of
a
sort
he
said
the
trouble
is
that
we
have
too
many
clues
i
wish
we
knew
which
is
the
right
one
anyway
it
knocks
over
your
theory
of
a
burglary
he
added
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
yes
rolfe
admitted
that
goes
by
the
board
chapter
v
what
is
your
name
james
hill
sir
that
is
an
alias
what
is
your
real
name
inspector
chippenfield
glared
fiercely
at
the
butler
in
order
to
impress
upon
him
the
fact
that
subterfuge
was
useless
henry
field
sir
replied
the
man
after
some
hesitation
inspector
chippenfield
opened
the
capacious
pocketbook
which
he
had
placed
before
him
on
the
desk
when
the
butler
had
entered
in
response
to
his
summons
and
he
took
from
it
a
photograph
which
he
handed
to
the
man
he
was
interrogating
is
that
your
photograph
he
asked
police
photographs
taken
in
gaol
for
purposes
of
future
identification
are
always
far
from
flattering
and
henry
field
after
looking
at
the
photograph
handed
to
him
hesitated
a
little
before
replying
yes
sir
so
henry
field
in
november
you
were
sentenced
to
three
years
for
robbing
your
master
lord
melhurst
yes
sir
let
me
see
said
the
inspector
as
if
calling
on
his
memory
to
perform
a
reluctant
task
it
was
a
diamond
and
a
gold
watch
lord
melhurst
had
come
home
after
a
good
day
at
epsom
and
a
late
supper
in
town
next
morning
he
missed
his
and
his
watch
he
thought
he
had
been
robbed
at
epsom
or
in
town
he
was
delightfully
vague
about
what
had
happened
to
him
after
his
glorious
day
at
epsom
but
unfortunately
for
you
the
driver
who
drove
him
remembered
seeing
the
pin
on
him
when
he
got
out
of
the
cab
as
you
had
waited
up
for
him
suspicion
fell
on
you
and
you
were
arrested
and
confessed
i
think
those
are
the
facts
field
yes
sir
said
the
distressed
looking
man
who
stood
before
him
i
think
i
had
the
pleasure
of
putting
you
through
added
the
inspector
the
butler
understood
that
in
police
slang
putting
a
man
through
meant
arresting
him
and
putting
him
through
the
criminal
court
into
gaol
he
made
the
same
reply
yes
sir
i
glad
to
see
you
bear
me
no
for
it
said
inspector
chippenfield
you
do
do
you
no
sir
i
never
forget
a
face
pursued
the
officer
glancing
up
at
the
face
of
the
man
before
him
when
i
saw
you
yesterday
i
knew
you
again
in
a
moment
and
when
i
went
back
to
the
yard
i
looked
up
your
record
the
butler
was
doubtful
whether
any
reply
was
called
for
but
after
a
pause
as
an
endorsement
of
the
inspector
gift
for
remembering
faces
he
ventured
on
yes
sir
and
how
did
you
an
come
to
get
into
the
service
of
one
of
his
majesty
judges
he
took
me
in
replied
the
butler
you
mean
that
you
took
him
in
replied
the
inspector
with
a
pleasant
laugh
at
his
own
witticism
no
sir
i
did
take
him
in
declared
the
butler
he
had
not
joined
in
the
laugh
at
the
inspector
joke
get
away
with
you
said
inspector
chippenfield
you
do
expect
me
to
believe
that
you
told
him
you
were
an
you
must
have
used
forged
references
no
sir
he
knew
i
was
a
hill
hesitated
at
referring
to
himself
as
an
though
he
had
not
shrunk
from
the
description
by
inspector
chippenfield
he
knew
that
i
had
been
in
trouble
in
fact
sir
if
you
remember
i
was
tried
before
him
the
devil
you
were
exclaimed
inspector
chippenfield
in
astonishment
and
he
took
you
into
his
service
after
you
had
served
your
sentence
he
must
have
been
mad
how
did
you
manage
it
after
i
came
out
i
found
it
hard
to
get
a
place
said
hill
and
when
sir
horace
butler
died
i
wrote
to
him
and
asked
if
he
would
give
me
a
chance
i
had
a
wife
and
child
sir
and
they
had
a
hard
struggle
while
i
was
in
prison
my
wife
had
a
shop
but
she
sold
it
to
find
money
for
my
defence
sir
horace
told
me
to
call
on
him
and
after
thinking
it
over
he
decided
to
engage
me
he
was
a
good
master
to
me
and
how
did
you
repay
him
exclaimed
inspector
chippenfield
sternly
by
murdering
him
the
butler
was
startled
by
the
suddenness
of
the
accusation
as
inspector
chippenfield
intended
he
should
be
me
he
exclaimed
as
sure
as
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
that
wo
go
down
with
me
field
said
the
police
officer
giving
the
wretched
man
another
prolonged
penetrating
look
it
true
it
true
he
protested
wildly
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
could
do
a
thing
like
that
sir
i
could
kill
a
man
if
i
wanted
to
i
have
the
nerve
but
i
knew
i
would
be
suspected
he
added
in
a
tone
of
oh
you
did
replied
inspector
chippenfield
and
why
was
that
because
of
my
past
where
were
you
on
the
date
of
the
murder
in
the
morning
i
came
over
here
to
look
round
as
usual
and
i
found
everything
all
right
you
did
that
every
day
while
sir
horace
was
away
not
every
day
sir
three
times
a
week
mondays
wednesdays
and
fridays
did
you
enter
the
house
or
just
look
round
i
always
came
inside
what
for
to
make
quite
sure
that
everything
was
all
right
and
was
everything
all
right
the
morning
of
the
yes
sir
you
are
quite
sure
of
that
you
looked
round
carefully
well
sir
i
just
gave
a
glance
round
for
of
course
i
did
expect
anything
would
be
wrong
inspector
chippenfield
fixed
a
steady
glance
on
the
butler
to
ascertain
if
he
was
conscious
of
the
trap
he
had
avoided
did
you
look
in
this
room
yes
sir
i
made
a
point
of
looking
in
all
the
rooms
you
are
sure
that
sir
horace
dead
body
was
not
lying
here
inspector
chippenfield
pointed
beside
the
desk
where
the
body
had
been
found
oh
no
sir
i
have
seen
it
if
it
had
there
was
no
sign
anywhere
of

little

i
had
promised

for
a
long
time
that

would
take

to
the
zoo
and
what
did
you
do
after
visiting
the

for

my
wife
took
the
little
girl
to
the
picture
palace
in
camden
road

quite
a
holiday

you
do
while

wife
and
child
were
at
the
pictures
i
stayed
at
home
and
minded
the
shop
when
they
came
home
we
all
went
to
bed
my
wife
will
tell
you
the
same
thing
i
no
doubt
she
will
said
the
inspector
drily
well
if
you
murder
sir
horace
yourself
when
did
you
first
hear
that
he
had
been
murdered
i
saw
it
in
the
papers
yesterday
evening
and
you
immediately
came
up
here
to
see
if
it
was
true
yes
sir
and
you
were
taken
to
the
hampstead
police
station
to
make
a
statement
as
to
your
movements
on
the
day
and
night
of
the
murder
yes
sir
and
the
story
you
have
just
told
me
about
the
zoo
and
the
pictures
and
the
rest
is
virtually
the
same
as
the
statement
you
made
at
the
station
yes
sir
do
you
know
if
sir
horace
kept
a
revolver
i
think
he
did
sir
where
did
he
keep
it
in
the
second
drawer
of
his
desk
sir
well
it
gone
remarked
inspector
chippenfield
without
opening
the
drawer
what
sort
of
a
revolver
was
it
did
you
ever
see
it
how
do
you
know
he
kept
one
once
or
twice
i
saw
something
that
looked
like
a
revolver
in
that
drawer
while
sir
horace
had
it
open
it
was
a
small
nickel
revolver
sir
horace
always
locked
his
desk
yes
sir
none
of
your
keys
will
open
it
of
course
no
sir
that
is
i
do
know
sir
i
never
tried
inspector
chippenfield
grunted
slightly
that
trap
the
butler
had
not
seen
until
too
late
but
of
course
all
servants
went
through
their
masters
private
papers
when
they
got
the
chance
do
you
know
if
sir
horace
was
in
the
habit
of
carrying
a
he
asked
yes
sir
he
was
what
sort
of
a
a
large
russian
leather
one
with
a
gold
clasp
did
he
take
it
away
with
him
when
he
went
to
scotland
did
you
see
it
about
the
house
after
he
left
no
sir
i
think
he
took
it
with
him
it
would
not
be
like
him
to
forget
it
or
to
leave
it
lying
about
and
what
sort
of
a
man
was
sir
horace
field
a
very
good
master
sir
he
could
be
very
stern
when
he
was
angry
but
i
got
on
very
well
with
him
quite
so
do
you
know
if
he
had
a
weakness
for
the
ladies
well
sir
i
heard
people
say
he
had
i
want
your
own
opinion
i
do
want
what
other
people
said
you
were
with
him
for
three
years
and
kept
a
pretty
close
watch
on
him
i
no
doubt
speaking
confidentially
i
might
say
that
i
think
he
was
said
hill
he
glanced
apprehensively
behind
him
as
if
afraid
of
the
dead
man
appearing
at
the
door
to
rebuke
him
for
presuming
to
speak
ill
of
him
i
thought
as
much
said
the
inspector
have
you
any
idea
why
he
came
down
from
scotland
no
sir
well
that
will
do
for
the
present
field
if
i
want
you
again
send
for
you
thank
you
sir
may
i
ask
a
question
sir
what
is
it
you
do
really
think
i
had
anything
to
do
with
it
sir
i
not
here
field
to
tell
you
what
i
think
this
much
i
will
say
if
i
find
you
have
tried
to
deceive
me
in
any
way
it
will
be
a
bad
day
for
you
yes
sir
grave
taciturn
watchful
secret
and
suave
with
an
appearance
of
reticence
about
him
which
a
perpetual
faint
questioning
look
in
his
eyes
denied
hill
looked
an
ideal
man
servant
who
knew
his
station
in
life
and
was
able
to
uphold
it
with
meek
dignity
from
the
top
of
his
grey
crown
to
his
silent
feet
he
exuded
deference
and
respectability
his
impassive
mask
of
a
face
was
incapable
apart
from
the
faint
query
note
in
the
eyes
of
betraying
any
of
the
feelings
or
emotions
which
ruffle
the
countenances
of
common
humanity
on
the
way
downstairs
hill
saw
flack
in
conversation
with
a
lady
at
the
front
door
the
lady
was
to
the
butler
as
holymead
the
wife
of
a
distinguished
barrister
who
had
been
one
of
his
master
closest
friends
she
seemed
glad
to
see
the
butler
for
she
greeted
him
with
a
remark
that
seemed
to
imply
a
kinship
in
sorrow
is
this
a
dreadful
thing
hill
she
said
it
terrible
madam
replied
hill
respectfully
holymead
was
extremely
beautiful
but
it
was
obvious
that
she
was
distressed
at
the
tragedy
for
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
her
face
was
pale
she
was
about
thirty
years
of
age
tall
slim
and
graceful
her
beauty
was
of
the
spanish
type
and
vivid
a
clear
olive
skin
and
full
petulant
crimson
lips
she
was
fashionably
dressed
in
black
with
a
black
hat
the
policeman
tells
me
that
miss
fewbanks
has
not
come
up
from
dellmere
yet
she
continued
no
madam
we
expect
her
i
believe
miss
fewbanks
has
been
too
prostrated
to
come
dreadful
dreadful
murmured
holymead
i
feel
i
want
to
know
all
about
it
and
yet
i
am
afraid
it
is
all
too
terrible
for
words
it
has
been
a
terrible
shock
madam
said
hill
has
the
housekeeper
come
up
hill
no
madam
she
will
be
up
with
miss
fewbanks
well
is
there
nobody
i
can
see
asked
holymead
flack
was
impressed
by
the
spectacle
of
a
beautiful
lady
in
distress
the
inspector
in
charge
of
the
case
is
upstairs
madam
he
suggested
perhaps
you
like
to
see
him
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
instructions
not
to
allow
any
stranger
into
the
house
and
police
instructions
at
such
a
time
were
of
a
nature
which
classed
a
friend
of
the
family
as
a
stranger
perhaps
i
better
ask
him
first
he
added
and
he
went
upstairs
with
the
feeling
that
he
had
laid
himself
open
to
severe
official
censure
from
inspector
chippenfield
he
came
downstairs
with
a
smile
on
his
face
and
the
message
that
the
inspector
would
be
pleased
to
see
holymead
in
his
brief
interview
with
his
superior
he
had
contrived
to
convey
the
unofficial
information
that
holymead
was
a
woman
and
he
had
no
doubt
that
inspector
chippenfield
readiness
to
see
her
was
due
to
the
impression
this
information
had
made
on
his
unofficial
feelings
holymead
was
conducted
upstairs
and
announced
by
the
butler
inspector
chippenfield
greeted
her
with
a
low
bow
of
conscious
inferiority
and
anticipated
hill
in
placing
a
chair
for
her
his
large
red
face
went
a
deeper
scarlet
in
colour
as
he
looked
at
her
flack
tells
me
that
you
are
a
friend
of
the
family
holymead
what
is
it
that
i
can
do
for
you
i
need
scarcely
say
holymead
that
your
distinguished
husband
is
well
known
to
us
all
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
being
by
him
on
several
occasions
anything
you
wish
to
know
i
be
pleased
to
tell
you
if
it
lies
within
my
power
thank
you
said
holymead
she
seemed
to
be
slightly
nervous
in
the
presence
of
a
member
of
the
scotland
yard
police
in
spite
of
his
obvious
humility
in
the
company
of
a
fashionable
lady
who
belonged
to
a
different
social
world
from
that
in
which
police
inspectors
moved
it
took
inspector
chippenfield
some
minutes
to
discover
that
the
object
of
holymead
visit
was
to
learn
some
of
the
details
of
the
tragedy
as
one
who
had
known
the
murdered
man
for
several
years
and
the
wife
of
his
intimate
friend
she
was
overwhelmed
by
the
awful
tragedy
she
endeavoured
to
explain
that
the
crime
was
like
a
horrible
dream
which
she
could
not
get
rid
of
but
in
spite
of
the
repugnance
with
which
she
contemplated
the
fact
that
a
gentleman
she
had
known
so
well
had
been
shot
down
in
his
own
house
she
felt
a
natural
curiosity
to
know
how
the
dreadful
crime
had
been
committed
inspector
chippenfield
availed
himself
of
the
opportunity
to
do
the
honours
of
the
occasion
he
went
over
the
details
of
the
tragedy
and
pointed
out
where
the
body
had
been
found
he
showed
her
the
bullet
mark
on
the
wall
and
the
flattened
bullet
which
had
been
extracted
although
from
the
mere
habit
of
official
caution
he
gave
away
no
information
which
was
not
of
a
superficial
and
obvious
kind
it
was
apparent
he
liked
talking
about
the
crime
and
his
responsibilities
as
the
officer
who
had
been
placed
in
charge
of
the
investigations
he
noted
the
interest
with
which
holymead
followed
his
words
and
he
was
satisfied
that
he
had
created
a
favourable
impression
on
her
it
was
his
desire
to
do
the
honours
thoroughly
which
led
him
to
remark
after
he
had
given
her
the
main
facts
of
the
tragedy
i
sorry
i
can
not
take
you
to
view
the
body
it
is
downstairs
but
the
fact
is
the
home
office
doctors
are
in
there
making
the
to
extract
the
bullet
holymead
shuddered
at
this
information
the
fact
that
such
gruesome
work
as
a
examination
was
proceeding
on
the
body
of
a
man
whom
she
had
known
so
well
brought
on
a
fit
of
nausea
her
head
fell
back
as
if
she
was
about
to
faint
can
i
have
a
glass
of
water
she
whispered
a
fainting
woman
if
she
is
beautiful
and
fashionably
dressed
will
unnerve
even
a
resourceful
police
official
had
she
been
one
of
the
servants
inspector
chippenfield
would
have
rung
the
bell
for
a
glass
of
water
to
throw
over
her
face
and
meantime
would
have
looked
on
calmly
at
such
evidence
of
the
weakness
of
sex
but
in
this
case
he
dashed
out
of
the
room
ran
downstairs
shouted
for
hill
ordered
him
to
find
a
glass
snatched
the
glass
from
him
filled
it
with
water
and
dashed
upstairs
again
his
absence
from
the
room
totalled
a
little
less
than
three
minutes
and
when
he
held
the
glass
to
the
lady
lips
he
was
out
of
breath
with
his
exertions
holymead
took
a
sip
of
water
shuddered
took
another
sip
then
heaved
a
sigh
and
opened
to
the
full
extent
her
large
dark
eyes
on
the
man
bending
over
her
who
felt
amply
repaid
by
such
a
glance
she
thanked
him
prettily
for
his
great
kindness
and
took
her
departure
being
conducted
downstairs
and
to
her
waiting
at
the
gate
by
inspector
chippenfield
that
officer
went
back
to
the
house
with
a
pleased
smile
on
his
features
but
he
would
not
have
been
so
pleased
with
himself
if
he
had
known
that
his
brief
absence
from
the
room
of
the
tragedy
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
a
glass
of
water
had
been
more
than
sufficient
to
enable
the
lady
to
run
to
the
open
desk
of
the
murdered
man
touch
a
spring
which
opened
a
secret
receptacle
at
the
back
of
it
extract
a
small
bundle
of
papers
close
the
spring
and
return
to
her
chair
to
await
in
a
fainting
attitude
the
return
of
the
chivalrous
police
officer
holymead
return
to
her
home
in
princes
gate
was
awaited
with
feverish
anxiety
by
one
of
the
inmates
this
was
mademoiselle
gabrielle
chiron
a
french
girl
of
about
who
was
a
distant
connection
of
holymead
by
marriage
a
cousin
of
holymead
had
married
lucille
chiron
the
younger
sister
of
gabrielle
two
years
ago
holymead
on
visiting
the
french
provincial
town
where
the
marriage
was
celebrated
was
attracted
by
gabrielle
as
the
chiron
family
were
not
wealthy
they
welcomed
the
friendship
between
gabrielle
and
the
beautiful
american
who
had
married
one
of
the
leading
barristers
in
london
and
finally
gabrielle
went
to
live
with
holymead
as
a
companion
from
the
window
of
an
upstairs
room
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
street
gabrielle
chiron
waited
impatiently
for
the
return
of
the
in
which
holymead
had
driven
to
riversbrook
when
at
length
it
turned
the
corner
and
came
into
view
she
rushed
downstairs
to
meet
holymead
she
opened
the
street
door
before
the
lady
of
the
house
could
ring
her
gaze
was
fixed
on
a
which
holymead
carried
a
comparatively
big
which
the
lady
had
taken
the
precaution
to
purchase
before
driving
out
to
riversbrook
the
french
girl
face
lighted
up
with
a
smile
as
she
saw
by
the
shape
of
the
bag
that
it
was
not
empty
have
you
got
them
she
whispered
yes
was
the
reply
i
followed
out
your
plan
it
worked
without
a
hitch
ah
i
knew
you
would
manage
it
said
the
girl
i
would
have
gone
but
it
was
best
that
you
should
go
these
police
agents
do
not
like
foreigners
they
would
be
suspicious
if
i
had
gone
there
was
a
big
man
in
charge
inspector
chippenfield
they
called
him
said
holymead
he
was
in
the
library
as
you
said
he
would
be
he
was
sitting
there
calmly
as
if
he
did
not
know
what
nerves
were
he
knew
me
as
a
friend
of
the
family
and
was
quite
nice
to
me
i
saw
as
soon
as
i
went
in
that
the
desk
was
open
he
had
been
examining
sir
horace
private
papers
i
asked
him
to
tell
me
about
the
about
the
tragedy
he
piled
horror
on
horror
and
then
i
pretended
to
faint
he
ran
down
stairs
for
a
glass
of
water
and
that
gave
me
time
to
open
the
secret
drawer
they
are
here
she
added
patting
the
affectionately
let
us
go
upstairs
and
burn
them
chapter
vi
there
was
unpleasant
news
for
inspector
chippenfield
when
miss
fewbanks
arrived
at
riversbrook
accompanied
by
the
housekeeper
hewson
in
the
first
place
he
learnt
with
considerable
astonishment
that
it
was
miss
fewbanks
intention
to
stay
at
the
house
until
after
the
funeral
and
for
that
purpose
she
had
brought
the
housekeeper
to
keep
her
company
in
the
lonely
old
place
although
they
had
taken
up
their
quarters
in
the
opposite
wing
of
the
rambling
mansion
to
that
in
which
the
dead
body
lay
it
seemed
to
inspector
chippenfield
whose
mind
was
very
impressionable
where
the
fair
sex
was
concerned
that
miss
fewbanks
must
be
a
very
peculiar
girl
to
contemplate
staying
in
the
same
house
with
the
body
of
her
murdered
father
for
nearly
a
week
he
was
convinced
that
she
must
be
a
young
woman
and
he
did
not
like
young
women
he
preferred
the
weak
and
clinging
type
of
the
sex
as
more
of
a
compliment
to
his
own
sturdy
manliness
his
unfavourable
impression
of
miss
fewbanks
was
deepened
when
he
saw
her
and
heard
what
she
had
to
tell
him
the
girl
had
come
up
from
the
country
filled
with
horror
at
the
crime
which
had
deprived
her
of
a
father
and
firmly
determined
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
bring
the
murderer
to
justice
it
was
true
that
she
and
her
father
had
lived
on
terms
of
partial
estrangement
for
some
time
past
because
of
his
manner
of
life
but
all
the
girl
feelings
of
resentment
against
him
had
been
swept
away
by
the
news
of
his
dreadful
death
and
all
she
remembered
now
was
that
he
was
her
father
and
had
been
brutally
murdered
when
she
sent
for
inspector
chippenfield
she
had
visited
the
room
in
which
lay
the
body
of
her
father
it
had
been
placed
in
a
coffin
which
was
resting
on
the
undertaker
trestles
in
the
bay
embrasure
of
the
big
room
with
the
folding
doors
there
was
nothing
in
the
appearance
of
the
corpse
to
suggest
that
a
crime
had
been
committed
but
it
had
been
impossible
for
the
undertaker
men
to
erase
entirely
the
distortion
of
the
features
so
that
they
might
suggest
the
cold
calm
dignity
of
a
peaceful
death
the
ordeal
of
looking
on
the
dead
body
of
her
father
had
nerved
her
to
carry
through
resolutely
the
task
of
discovering
the
author
of
the
crime
she
awaited
the
coming
of
the
inspector
in
a
small
and
when
he
entered
she
pointed
quickly
to
a
chair
but
remained
standing
herself
in
appearance
miss
fewbanks
was
a
charming
girl
of
the
typical
english
type
she
was
of
medium
height
slight
but
with
fair
hair
and
dark
blue
eyes
an
imperious
short
upper
lip
and
a
determined
chin
and
the
clear
healthy
complexion
of
a
girl
who
has
lived
much
out
of
doors
the
inspector
noted
all
these
details
noted
too
that
although
her
breast
heaved
with
agitation
she
had
herself
well
under
control
her
pretty
head
was
erect
and
one
of
her
small
hands
was
tightly
clenched
by
her
side
have
you
found
out
anything
she
asked
the
inspector
as
he
entered
the
girl
had
chosen
a
vague
word
because
she
felt
that
there
were
many
things
which
must
come
to
light
in
unravelling
the
crime
but
from
the
police
point
of
view
of
inspector
chippenfield
the
question
whether
he
had
found
out
anything
was
a
stinging
reflection
on
his
ability
i
consider
it
inadvisable
to
make
any
arrest
at
the
present
stage
of
my
investigations
he
said
with
cold
official
dignity
do
you
think
you
know
who
did
it
asked
the
girl
it
is
my
business
to
find
out
replied
the
inspector
in
a
voice
that
indicated
confidence
in
his
ability
to
perform
the
task
the
girl
was
too
unsophisticated
to
follow
the
subtle
workings
of
official
pride
the
papers
call
it
a
mysterious
crime
do
you
think
it
is
mysterious
there
are
certainly
some
mysterious
features
about
it
said
the
inspector
but
i
do
not
regard
them
as
insoluble
nothing
is
insoluble
he
added
in
a
sententious
tone
if
there
are
mysteries
to
be
solved
you
ought
to
have
help
said
the
young
lady
she
glanced
at
hewson
significantly
and
then
proceeded
to
explain
to
inspector
chippenfield
what
she
meant
i
have
asked
crewe
the
celebrated
detective
to
assist
you
of
course
you
know
crewe
everybody
does
i
know
you
are
a
very
clever
man
at
your
profession
but
in
a
thing
of
this
kind
two
clever
men
are
better
than
one
i
hope
you
will
not
mind
there
is
no
reflection
whatever
on
your
ability
in
fact
i
have
the
utmost
confidence
in
you
but
it
is
due
to
my
father
memory
to
do
all
that
is
possible
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
dreadful
crime
if
money
is
needed
it
will
be
forthcoming
that
applies
to
you
no
less
than
to
crewe
but
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
carry
out
your
investigations
amicably
together
and
that
you
will
be
willing
to
assist
one
another
you
will
lose
nothing
by
doing
so
i
trust
you
will
place
at
crewe
disposal
all
the
facilities
that
are
available
to
you
as
an
officer
of
the
police
this
statement
was
so
clear
that
inspector
chippenfield
had
no
choice
but
to
face
the
conclusion
that
miss
fewbanks
had
more
faith
in
the
abilities
of
a
private
detective
to
unravel
the
mystery
than
she
had
in
the
resources
of
scotland
yard
he
would
have
liked
to
have
told
the
young
lady
what
he
thought
of
her
for
interfering
with
his
work
and
he
determined
to
avail
himself
of
the
right
opportunity
to
do
so
if
it
came
along
but
the
statement
that
money
was
not
to
be
spared
had
a
soothing
influence
on
his
feelings
of
course
officers
of
scotland
yard
were
not
allowed
to
take
gratuities
however
substantial
they
might
be
but
there
were
material
ways
of
expressing
gratitude
which
were
outside
the
regulations
of
the
department
i
shall
be
very
pleased
to
give
crewe
any
assistance
he
wants
said
inspector
chippenfield
bowing
stiffly
it
was
seldom
that
he
took
a
subordinate
fully
into
his
confidence
but
after
he
left
miss
fewbanks
he
flung
aside
his
official
pride
in
order
to
discuss
with
rolfe
the
enlistment
of
the
services
of
crewe
rolfe
was
no
less
indignant
than
his
chief
at
the
intrusion
of
an
outsider
into
their
sphere
crewe
was
an
exponent
of
the
deductive
school
of
crime
investigation
and
had
first
achieved
fame
over
the
abbindon
case
some
years
ago
when
he
had
succeeded
in
restoring
the
kidnapped
heir
of
the
abbindon
estates
after
the
police
had
failed
to
trace
the
missing
child
in
detective
stories
the
attitude
of
members
of
scotland
yard
to
the
deductive
expert
is
that
of
admiration
based
on
conscious
inferiority
but
in
real
life
the
experts
of
scotland
yard
have
the
utmost
contempt
for
the
deductive
experts
and
their
methods
the
disdainful
pity
of
the
deductive
experts
for
the
methods
of
the
police
is
not
to
be
compared
with
the
vigorous
scorn
of
the
official
detective
for
the
rival
who
has
not
had
the
benefit
of
police
training
look
here
rolfe
said
inspector
chippenfield
we
must
let
crewe
get
ahead
of
us
in
this
affair
or
we
never
hear
the
last
of
it
scandalous
of
a
man
like
crewe
who
has
money
of
his
own
and
could
live
like
a
gentleman
coming
along
and
taking
the
bread
out
of
our
mouths
by
accepting
fees
and
rewards
for
hunting
after
criminals
of
course
i
know
they
say
he
is
lavish
with
his
money
and
gives
away
more
than
he
earns
but
that
all
bosh
he
sticks
it
in
his
own
pocket
right
enough
one
thing
is
certain
he
gets
paid
whether
he
wins
or
loses
that
is
to
say
he
gets
his
fee
in
any
case
but
of
course
if
he
wins
something
will
be
added
to
his
fee
in
the
meantime
all
you
and
i
get
is
our
salaries
and
as
you
know
the
pay
of
an
inspector
is
what
it
ought
to
be
rolfe
assured
his
superior
of
his
conviction
that
the
pay
at
scotland
yard
ought
to
be
higher
for
all
ranks
especially
the
rank
and
file
he
also
declared
that
he
was
ready
to
do
his
best
to
thwart
crewe
that
is
the
right
spirit
commented
inspector
chippenfield
approvingly
of
course
we
tell
him
we
willing
to
help
him
all
we
can
and
of
course
hell
tell
us
we
can
depend
on
his
help
but
we
know
what
his
help
will
amount
to
he
keep
back
from
us
anything
he
finds
out
and
do
the
same
for
him
but
the
point
is
rolfe
that
you
and
i
have
to
put
all
our
brains
into
this
and
help
one
another
i
not
the
man
to
despise
help
from
a
subordinate
if
you
have
any
ideas
about
this
case
rolfe
do
not
be
afraid
to
speak
out
i
give
them
sympathetic
consideration
i
know
you
will
said
rolfe
who
was
by
no
means
sure
of
the
fact
you
can
count
on
me
as
you
know
rolfe
there
have
been
cases
in
which
men
from
the
yard
have
worked
together
as
amicably
as
they
ought
to
have
done
it
used
to
be
said
when
i
was
one
of
the
men
that
the
man
in
charge
got
all
the
credit
and
the
men
under
him
did
all
the
work
but
as
an
inspector
i
can
tell
you
that
is
very
rarely
the
case
in
my
reports
i
believe
in
giving
my
junior
credit
for
all
he
has
done
and
generally
a
bit
more
it
may
be
foolish
of
me
but
that
is
my
way
i
never
miss
a
chance
of
putting
in
a
good
word
for
the
man
under
me
it
would
be
better
if
they
were
all
like
that
said
rolfe
well
it
a
bargain
rolfe
said
inspector
chippenfield
you
do
your
best
on
this
job
and
you
wo
lose
by
it
i
see
to
that
but
in
the
meantime
we
do
want
to
put
crewe
on
the
scent
let
us
see
how
much
we
tell
him
and
how
much
we
wo
he
want
to
see
the
letter
sent
to
the
yard
about
the
murder
said
rolfe
the
published
a
facsimile
of
it
this
morning
yes
i
knew
about
that
well
he
can
have
it
but
do
say
anything
to
him
about
that
lace
you
found
in
the
dead
man
hand
or
at
any
rate
not
until
you
find
out
more
about
it
the
glove
he
can
have
since
it
is
pretty
obvious
that
it
belonged
to
sir
horace
we
spin
crewe
a
yarn
that
we
are
depending
on
it
as
a
clue
crewe
arrived
during
the
afternoon
to
inspect
the
house
and
the
room
in
which
the
crime
had
been
committed
there
was
every
appearance
of
cordiality
in
the
way
in
which
he
greeted
the
police
officials
delighted
to
see
you
inspector
he
said
who
is
working
this
case
with
you
rolfe
do
think
we
have
met
before
rolfe
have
we
rolfe
politely
murmured
something
about
not
having
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
crewe
but
of
always
having
wanted
to
meet
him
because
of
his
fame
very
good
of
you
replied
crewe
this
is
a
very
sad
business
i
understand
there
are
some
attractive
points
of
mystery
in
the
crime
i
hope
you
have
unravelled
it
yet
before
i
have
got
a
start
you
fellows
are
so
quick
slow
and
sure
is
our
motto
said
inspector
chippenfield
feeling
certain
that
a
sneer
and
not
a
compliment
had
been
intended
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
in
arresting
the
wrong
man
that
a
sound
maxim
for
us
all
said
crewe
however
let
get
to
business
i
rang
up
the
yard
this
morning
and
they
told
me
you
were
in
charge
of
the
case
and
that
i
probably
find
you
here
can
you
let
me
have
a
look
at
the
original
of
that
letter
which
was
sent
to
scotland
yard
informing
you
of
the
murder
there
is
a
facsimile
of
it
in
the
this
morning
and
from
all
appearances
there
are
some
interesting
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
it
but
the
original
is
the
thing
here
you
are
said
the
inspector
producing
his
taking
out
the
paper
and
handing
it
to
crewe
what
do
you
make
of
it
crewe
sat
down
and
placing
the
paper
before
him
took
a
magnifying
glass
from
his
pocket
as
he
sat
there
in
his
grey
tweed
suit
his
hat
pushed
carelessly
back
from
his
forehead
he
might
have
been
mistaken
for
a
young
man
of
wealth
with
no
serious
business
in
life
for
his
clothes
were
of
fashionable
cut
and
he
wore
them
with
an
air
of
distinction
but
a
glance
at
his
face
would
have
dispelled
the
impression
the
features
riveted
attention
by
reason
of
their
strength
and
intelligence
and
though
the
dark
eyes
were
rather
too
dreamy
for
the
face
the
heavy
lines
of
the
lower
jaw
indicated
the
man
of
action
and
force
of
character
the
thick
neck
and
firm
mouth
suggested
tireless
energy
and
abounding
vitality
at
least
two
people
have
had
a
hand
in
it
he
said
after
studying
the
paper
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
murder
asked
the
inspector
who
was
astonished
at
a
deduction
which
harmonised
with
a
theory
which
had
begun
to
take
shape
in
his
mind
in
writing
this
said
crewe
with
his
attention
still
fixed
on
the
paper
but
of
course
you
know
that
yourself
of
course
assented
the
inspector
who
was
surprised
at
the
information
but
was
too
experienced
an
official
to
show
his
feelings
and
both
hands
disguised
disguised
to
the
extent
of
being
printed
in
written
characters
continued
crewe
it
is
so
seldom
that
a
person
writes
printed
characters
that
any
method
in
which
they
are
written
suggests
disguise
the
original
intention
of
the
two
persona
who
wrote
this
extraordinary
note
was
for
each
to
write
a
single
letter
in
turn
that
system
was
carried
as
far
as
horace
or
perhaps
up
to
the
in
after
that
they
became
weary
of
changing
places
and
one
of
them
wrote
alternate
letters
to
the
end
leaving
blanks
for
the
other
to
fill
in
that
much
is
to
be
gathered
from
the
variations
in
the
spaces
between
the
letters
sometimes
there
was
too
much
room
for
an
intermediate
letter
sometimes
too
little
so
the
letter
had
to
be
cramped
here
and
there
are
dots
made
with
the
pen
as
the
first
of
the
two
spelled
out
the
words
so
as
to
know
what
letters
to
write
and
what
to
leave
blank
look
at
the
differences
in
the
letter
one
of
the
writers
makes
it
a
firm
downward
and
upward
stroke
the
other
makes
the
letter
fainter
and
adds
another
downward
stroke
the
letter
being
more
like
a
small
written
larger
than
a
capital
letter
the
differences
in
the
two
hands
are
so
pronounced
throughout
the
note
that
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
one
of
the
writers
was
a
woman
exactly
what
i
thought
said
inspector
chippenfield
looking
hard
at
crewe
so
that
the
latter
should
not
question
his
good
faith
then
there
are
sometimes
slight
differences
in
the
alternate
letters
written
by
the
same
hand
look
at
the
in
and
the
in
the
marked
variation
in
the
length
and
angle
of
the
cross
stroke
it
is
evident
that
the
writers
were
labouring
under
serious
excitement
when
they
wrote
this
rolfe
was
so
interested
in
crewe
revelations
that
he
stood
beside
the
deductive
expert
and
studied
the
paper
afresh
and
now
about
asked
crews
none
was
the
reply
of
the
inspector
we
had
it
under
the
microscope
at
scotland
yard
none
exclaimed
crewe
in
surprise
why
adopt
such
precautions
as
wearing
gloves
to
write
a
note
giving
away
this
startling
secret
easy
enough
replied
inspector
chippenfield
the
people
who
wrote
the
note
either
had
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
the
murder
but
were
afraid
suspicion
might
be
directed
to
them
or
else
they
are
the
murderers
and
want
to
direct
suspicion
from
themselves
and
now
for
the
bullets
said
crewe
i
understand
two
shots
were
fired
from
two
revolvers
said
the
inspector
here
are
both
bullets
this
one
i
picked
out
of
the
wall
over
there
you
can
see
where
i
broken
away
the
plaster
this
one
much
the
bigger
one
of
the
two
was
the
one
that
killed
sir
horace
the
doctor
handed
it
to
me
after
the
did
sir
horace
keep
a
revolver
the
butler
says
yes
but
if
he
did
it
gone
crewe
stood
up
and
examined
the
hole
in
the
wall
where
inspector
chippenfield
had
dug
out
the
smaller
bullet
sir
horace
made
a
bid
for
his
life
but
missed
of
course
he
had
no
time
to
take
aim
while
there
was
a
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
covering
him
but
in
any
case
those
fancy
firearms
can
not
be
depended
upon
to
shoot
straight
you
think
sir
horace
fired
at
his
murderer
fired
first
asked
rolfe
this
small
bullet
suggests
one
of
those
fancy
weapons
that
are
made
to
sell
to
wealthy
people
sir
horace
was
a
bit
of
a
sportsman
and
knew
something
about
but
i
take
it
he
had
no
use
for
a
revolver
i
assume
he
kept
one
of
those
fancy
weapons
on
hand
thinking
he
would
never
have
to
use
it
but
that
it
would
do
to
frighten
a
burglar
if
the
occasion
did
arise
and
when
he
was
held
up
in
this
room
by
a
man
with
a
revolver
he
made
a
dash
for
his
own
revolver
and
got
in
the
first
shot
suggested
rolfe
with
the
idea
of
outlining
crewe
theory
of
how
the
crime
was
committed
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
reconstruct
the
crime
to
that
extent
said
crewe
with
a
smile
but
undoubtedly
sir
horace
got
in
the
first
shot
if
he
fired
after
he
was
hit
his
bullet
would
have
gone
wild
would
probably
have
struck
the
ceiling
whereas
it
landed
there
let
us
measure
the
height
from
the
floor
he
pulled
a
small
spool
out
of
a
waistcoat
pocket
and
drew
out
a
tape
measure
a
little
high
for
the
heart
of
an
average
man
and
probably
a
foot
wide
of
the
mark
and
what
do
you
make
of
the
disappearance
of
sir
horace
revolver
asked
rolfe
who
seemed
to
his
superior
officer
to
be
in
danger
of
displaying
some
admiration
for
deductive
methods
i
no
good
at
replied
crewe
who
felt
that
he
had
given
enough
information
away
well
said
rolfe
here
is
a
glove
which
was
found
in
the
room
the
other
one
is
missing
it
might
be
a
clue
crewe
took
the
glove
and
examined
it
carefully
it
was
a
glove
made
of
and
grey
in
colour
it
bore
evidence
of
having
been
in
use
but
it
was
still
a
glove
such
as
a
man
who
took
a
pride
in
his
appearance
might
wear
burglars
wear
gloves
nowadays
said
crewe
but
not
this
kind
the
glove
with
only
the
thumb
separate
is
best
for
their
work
they
give
freedom
of
action
for
the
fingers
and
leave
no
have
you
made
inquiries
whether
this
is
one
of
sir
horace
gloves
well
it
is
the
same
size
as
he
wore
seven
and
a
half
said
inspector
chippenfield
the
butler
is
the
only
servant
here
and
he
ca
say
for
certain
that
it
belonged
to
his
master
i
been
through
sir
wardrobe
and
through
the
he
brought
from
scotland
but
i
can
find
no
other
pair
exactly
similar
rolfe
took
it
to
sir
horace
hosier
and
he
is
practically
certain
that
the
glove
is
one
of
a
pair
he
sold
to
sir
horace
that
should
be
conclusive
said
crewe
thoughtfully
so
i
think
replied
the
inspector
well
i
take
it
with
me
if
you
do
mind
said
crewe
you
can
have
it
back
whenever
you
want
it
let
me
have
the
address
of
sir
horace
hosier
i
give
him
a
call
take
it
by
all
means
said
the
inspector
cordially
referring
to
the
glove
and
with
a
wink
at
rolfe
he
added
and
when
you
are
ready
to
fit
it
on
the
guilty
hand
i
hope
you
will
let
us
know
chapter
vii
crewe
made
a
careful
inspection
of
the
house
and
the
grounds
he
took
measurements
of
the
impressions
left
on
the
sill
of
the
window
which
had
been
forced
and
also
of
the
immediately
beneath
the
window
he
had
a
long
conversation
with
hill
and
questioned
him
regarding
his
movements
on
the
night
of
the
murder
he
also
asked
about
the
other
servants
who
were
at
dellmere
and
probed
for
information
about
sir
horace
domestic
life
and
his
friends
as
he
was
talking
to
hill
flack
came
up
to
them
with
a
card
in
his
hand
hill
looked
at
the
card
and
exclaimed
holymead
what
does
he
want
he
asked
if
miss
fewbanks
was
at
home
hill
took
the
card
in
to
miss
fewbanks
and
on
coming
out
went
to
the
front
door
and
escorted
holymead
to
his
young
mistress
crewe
as
was
his
habit
looked
closely
at
holymead
the
eminent
was
a
tall
man
nearly
six
feet
in
height
with
a
large
resolute
face
which
when
framed
in
a
wig
was
suggestive
of
the
dignity
and
severity
of
the
law
in
years
he
was
about
fifty
and
in
his
figure
there
was
a
suggestion
of
that
rotundity
which
overtakes
the
man
who
has
given
up
physical
exercise
he
was
correctly
if
sombrely
dressed
in
dark
clothes
and
he
wore
a
black
tie
probably
as
a
symbol
of
mourning
for
his
friend
his
gloves
were
a
delicate
grey
crewe
sought
out
hill
again
and
questioned
him
closely
about
the
relations
which
had
existed
between
sir
horace
fewbanks
and
holymead
whose
enormous
practice
brought
him
in
an
income
three
times
as
large
as
the
dead
judge
and
kept
him
constantly
before
the
public
hill
was
able
to
supply
the
detective
with
some
interesting
information
regarding
the
visitor
and
in
contrast
to
his
manner
when
previously
questioned
at
random
by
crewe
concerning
his
young
mistress
habits
seemed
willing
if
not
actually
anxious
to
talk
he
had
heard
from
sir
housekeeper
that
his
late
master
and
holymead
had
been
law
students
together
and
after
they
were
called
to
the
bar
they
used
to
spend
their
holidays
together
as
long
as
they
were
single
when
they
were
married
their
wives
became
friends
holymead
had
died
fourteen
years
ago
but
fewbanks
sir
horace
had
not
been
a
baronet
while
his
wife
was
alive
had
lived
some
years
longer
holymead
had
married
again
his
second
wife
was
a
very
beautiful
young
lady
if
he
might
make
so
bold
as
to
say
so
who
had
come
from
america
the
butler
added
deprecatingly
that
he
had
been
told
that
both
sir
horace
and
holymead
had
paid
her
some
attention
and
that
she
could
have
had
either
of
them
she
was
different
to
english
ladies
he
added
she
had
more
to
say
for
herself
and
laughed
and
talked
with
the
gentlemen
just
as
if
she
was
one
of
themselves
hill
mentioned
that
she
had
been
out
to
see
miss
fewbanks
the
previous
day
but
that
miss
fewbanks
had
not
come
up
from
dellmere
then
so
she
had
seen
inspector
chippenfield
instead
while
crewe
and
the
butler
were
talking
a
boy
of
about
fourteen
with
the
shrewd
face
of
a
london
arab
approached
them
with
an
air
of
mystery
he
came
down
the
hall
with
long
cautious
strides
and
halted
at
each
step
as
if
he
were
stalking
a
band
of
indians
in
a
forest
well
joe
what
is
it
asked
crewe
as
he
came
to
a
halt
in
front
of
them
if
you
do
want
me
for
half
an
hour
sir
i
like
to
take
a
run
up
the
street
there
is
a
real
good
picture
house
just
been
opened
the
boy
spoke
eagerly
with
his
bright
eyes
fixed
on
crewe
i
may
want
you
any
minute
joe
replied
crewe
do
go
away
the
boy
nodded
his
head
and
turned
away
as
he
went
down
the
hall
again
to
the
front
door
he
gave
an
imitation
of
a
man
walking
with
extended
arms
across
a
plank
spanning
a
chasm
picture
mad
commented
crewe
as
he
watched
him
i
did
quite
understand
you
sir
replied
the
butler
spends
all
his
spare
time
in
cinemas
said
crewe
and
when
he
is
not
there
he
is
acting
picture
dramas
his
ambition
in
life
is
to
be
a
cinema
actor
crewe
engaged
flack
in
conversation
while
waiting
for
holymead
to
take
his
departure
flack
had
so
little
professional
pride
that
he
was
pleased
at
meeting
a
gentleman
who
usurped
the
functions
of
a
detective
without
having
had
any
police
training
and
who
could
beat
the
best
of
the
scotland
yard
men
like
shelling
peas
as
he
confided
to
his
wife
that
night
he
was
especially
flattered
at
the
interest
crewe
seemed
to
display
in
his
long
connection
with
the
police
force
and
also
in
his
private
affairs
the
constable
was
explaining
with
parental
vanity
the
precocious
cleverness
of
his
youngest
child
a
girl
of
two
when
holymead
made
his
appearance
and
he
became
aware
that
crewe
interest
in
children
was
at
an
end
look
at
that
man
said
crewe
in
a
sharp
imperative
tone
to
the
as
the
was
walking
down
the
path
of
the
italian
garden
to
the
plantation
you
saw
him
come
in
yes
sir
do
you
see
any
difference
no
sir
he
the
same
man
said
flack
with
stolid
certainty
anything
about
him
that
is
different
continued
crewe
flack
looked
at
crewe
in
some
bewilderment
he
was
not
a
deductive
expert
and
as
he
told
his
wife
afterwards
he
did
not
know
what
the
detective
was
driving
at
he
took
another
long
look
at
holymead
who
was
then
within
a
few
yards
of
the
plantation
on
his
way
to
the
gates
and
remarked
in
a
hesitating
tone
as
though
to
justify
his
failure
well
you
see
sir
when
he
was
coming
in
it
was
the
front
view
i
saw
now
i
can
only
see
his
back
but
before
he
had
finished
speaking
crewe
had
left
him
and
was
following
the
holymead
had
gone
into
the
house
without
a
and
had
reappeared
carrying
one
on
his
arm
crewe
admired
the
cool
audacity
which
had
prompted
holymead
to
go
into
a
house
where
a
murder
had
been
committed
to
recover
his
stick
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
police
and
he
immediately
formed
the
conclusion
that
the
had
come
to
the
house
to
recover
the
stick
for
some
urgent
reason
possibly
not
unconnected
with
the
crime
and
it
was
apparent
that
holymead
was
a
shrewd
judge
of
human
nature
crewe
reflected
for
he
calculated
that
the
rareness
of
the
quality
of
observation
even
in
those
who
like
flack
were
supposed
to
keep
their
eyes
open
would
permit
him
to
do
so
unnoticed
as
crewe
went
down
the
path
he
beckoned
to
the
boy
joe
who
at
the
moment
was
acting
the
part
of
a
comic
dentist
binding
a
recalcitrant
patient
to
a
chair
using
an
immense
chair
which
stood
in
the
hall
for
his
stage
setting
joe
overtook
his
master
as
he
entered
the
ornamental
plantation
in
front
of
the
house
and
crewe
quickly
whispered
his
instructions
as
the
retreating
figure
of
the
threaded
the
wood
towards
the
gates
when
i
catch
up
level
with
him
joe
you
are
to
run
into
him
accidentally
from
behind
and
knock
his
stick
off
his
arm
so
that
it
falls
near
me
i
will
pick
it
up
and
return
it
to
him
i
must
handle
the
stick
you
understand
do
not
wait
to
see
how
he
takes
it
when
you
bump
into
him
get
off
round
the
corner
at
once
and
wait
for
me
crewe
quickened
his
pace
to
overtake
the
man
in
front
of
him
he
gave
no
glance
backward
at
the
boy
for
he
knew
his
instructions
would
be
carried
out
faithfully
and
intelligently
he
allowed
holymead
to
reach
the
big
open
gates
and
turn
from
the
gravelled
carriage
drive
into
the
private
street
then
he
hurried
after
him
and
drew
level
with
holymead
as
he
did
so
there
was
a
sound
of
running
footsteps
from
behind
and
then
a
shout
joe
had
cleverly
tripped
and
fallen
heavily
between
the
two
men
bringing
down
holymead
in
his
fall
the
stick
flew
off
his
arm
and
bounded
half
a
dozen
yards
away
crewe
stepped
forward
quickly
secured
the
stick
glanced
quickly
at
the
monogram
engraved
on
it
and
held
it
out
to
holymead
who
was
brushing
the
dust
off
his
clothes
with
vexatious
remarks
about
the
clumsiness
and
impudence
of
street
boys
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
hesitate
about
taking
the
stick
i
believe
this
is
yours
said
crewe
politely
ah
yes
thank
you
said
the
giving
him
a
keen
suspicious
glance
chapter
viii
crewe
had
offices
in
holborn
but
lived
in
a
luxurious
flat
in
jermyn
street
although
he
went
to
and
fro
between
them
daily
his
personality
was
almost
a
dual
one
though
not
consciously
so
his
passion
for
crime
investigation
was
distinct
in
outward
seeming
at
all
events
from
his
polished
west
end
life
of
wealthy
ease
grave
and
inscrutable
he
slipped
from
one
to
the
other
with
an
effortless
regularity
and
the
fashionable
folk
with
whom
he
mixed
in
his
leisured
bachelor
existence
in
the
west
end
apart
from
knowing
him
as
the
famous
crewe
had
even
less
knowledge
of
the
real
man
behind
his
suave
exterior
than
the
clients
who
visited
his
inquiry
rooms
in
holborn
to
confide
in
him
their
stories
of
suffering
shame
or
crimes
committed
against
them
his
commissionaire
and
stork
had
once
in
a
rare
almost
unique
convivial
moment
declared
to
the
caretaker
of
the
building
that
he
knew
no
more
about
his
master
after
ten
years
than
he
did
the
first
day
he
entered
his
service
he
was
deep
beyond
all
belief
was
stork
opinion
delivered
with
reluctant
admiration
although
crewe
did
not
allow
the
externals
of
his
two
existences
to
become
involved
his
chief
interest
in
life
was
in
his
work
he
had
originally
taken
up
detective
work
more
as
a
relief
from
the
boredom
of
his
lot
as
a
wealthy
young
man
leading
an
aimless
useless
life
with
others
of
his
class
than
by
deliberate
choice
of
his
vocation
his
initial
successes
surprised
him
then
the
work
absorbed
him
and
became
his
life
career
he
had
achieved
some
memorable
successes
and
he
had
made
a
few
failures
but
the
failures
belonged
to
the
earlier
portion
of
his
career
before
he
had
learnt
to
trust
thoroughly
in
his
own
great
gifts
of
intuition
and
insight
and
that
uncanny
imagination
which
sometimes
carried
him
successfully
through
when
all
else
failed
serious
devotees
of
chess
knew
the
name
of
crewe
in
another
capacity
as
the
name
of
a
man
who
might
have
aspired
to
great
deeds
if
he
had
but
taken
the
game
as
his
life
career
he
had
flashed
across
the
chess
horizon
some
years
previously
as
a
player
of
surpassing
brilliance
by
defeating
turgieff
when
the
great
russian
master
had
visited
london
and
had
played
twelve
simultaneous
boards
at
the
london
chess
club
crewe
was
the
only
player
of
the
twelve
to
win
his
game
and
he
did
so
by
a
masterly
concealed
ending
in
which
he
handled
his
pawns
with
consummate
skill
proffering
the
sacrifice
of
a
bishop
with
such
art
that
turgieff
fell
into
the
trap
and
was
mated
in
five
subsequent
moves
crewe
proved
this
was
not
merely
a
lucky
win
by
defeating
the
young
south
american
champion
caranda
shortly
afterwards
when
the
latter
visited
england
and
played
a
series
of
exhibition
games
in
london
on
his
way
to
moscow
where
he
was
engaged
in
the
championship
tourney
once
again
it
was
masterly
pawn
play
which
brought
crewe
a
fine
victory
and
aged
chess
enthusiasts
who
followed
every
move
of
the
game
with
trembling
excitement
declared
afterwards
that
crewe
conception
of
this
particular
game
had
not
been
equalled
since
morphy
died
they
predicted
a
dazzling
chess
career
for
crewe
but
he
disappointed
their
aged
hearts
by
retiring
suddenly
from
match
chess
and
they
mourned
him
as
one
unworthy
of
his
great
chess
gifts
and
the
high
hopes
they
had
placed
in
him
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
crewe
intellect
was
too
vigorous
and
active
to
be
satisfied
with
the
triumphs
of
chess
and
his
disappearance
from
the
chess
world
was
contemporary
with
his
entrance
into
detective
work
which
appealed
to
his
imagination
and
found
scope
for
his
restless
mental
activity
but
if
detective
work
so
absorbed
him
that
he
gave
up
match
chess
entirely
he
still
retained
an
interest
in
the
science
of
chess
reserving
problem
play
for
his
spare
moments
and
when
not
immersed
in
the
solution
of
a
problem
of
human
mystery
he
would
turn
to
the
chessboard
and
seek
solace
and
relaxation
in
the
mysteries
of
an
intricate
he
had
once
said
that
there
was
a
certain
affinity
between
solving
chess
problems
and
the
detection
of
crime
mystery
once
the
was
found
the
rest
was
comparatively
easy
but
he
added
with
a
sigh
that
a
really
perfect
crime
mystery
was
as
rare
as
a
perfect
chess
problem
human
ingenuity
was
not
sufficiently
skilful
as
a
rule
to
commit
a
crime
or
construct
a
chess
problem
with
completely
artistic
concealment
of
the
and
for
that
reason
most
problems
and
crimes
were
far
too
easy
of
detection
to
absorb
one
intellectual
interests
and
attention
it
was
the
morning
after
crewe
visit
to
riversbrook
and
the
detective
sat
in
his
private
office
glancing
through
a
which
contained
a
summary
of
the
hampstead
mystery
crewe
was
a
painstaking
detective
as
well
as
a
brilliant
one
and
it
was
his
custom
to
prepare
several
critical
summaries
of
any
important
case
on
which
he
was
engaged
writing
and
rewriting
the
facts
and
his
comments
until
he
was
satisfied
that
he
had
a
perfect
outline
to
work
upon
with
the
details
and
clues
of
the
crime
in
consecutive
order
and
relation
to
one
another
experience
had
taught
him
that
the
time
and
labour
this
task
involved
were
if
an
unexpected
development
of
the
case
altered
the
facts
of
the
original
summary
crewe
prepared
another
one
in
the
same
painstaking
way
the
summaries
when
done
with
were
methodically
filed
and
indexed
and
stored
in
a
strong
room
at
the
office
for
future
reference
where
he
also
kept
full
records
of
all
the
cases
upon
which
he
had
been
engaged
together
with
the
weapons
and
articles
that
had
figured
in
them
huge
volumes
of
newspaper
reports
and
clippings
photographs
of
criminals
with
their
careers
appended
and
a
host
of
other
odds
and
ends
of
his
detective
investigations
the
whole
forming
an
interesting
museum
of
crime
and
mystery
which
would
have
furnished
a
store
of
rich
material
for
a
fresh
newgate
calendar
it
was
an
axiom
of
crewe
that
a
detective
never
knew
when
some
old
scrap
of
information
or
some
trifling
article
of
some
dead
and
forgotten
crime
might
not
afford
a
valuable
clue
expert
criminals
frequently
repeated
themselves
like
people
in
lesser
walks
of
life
and
crewe
library
and
museum
as
he
called
it
had
sometimes
furnished
him
with
a
simple
hint
for
the
solution
of
a
mystery
which
had
defied
more
subtle
methods
of
analysis
crewe
after
carefully
reading
his
summary
of
the
murder
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
and
making
a
few
alterations
in
the
text
drew
from
his
pocket
the
glove
which
inspector
chippenfield
had
handed
him
as
a
clue
took
it
to
the
window
and
carefully
examined
it
through
a
large
magnifying
glass
he
was
thus
engrossed
when
the
door
was
noiselessly
opened
and
stork
the
bodyguard
entered
stork
belied
his
name
he
was
short
and
fat
with
a
red
mottled
face
a
model
of
discretion
and
imperturbability
who
had
served
crewe
for
ten
years
and
bade
fair
to
serve
him
another
ten
if
he
lived
that
long
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
often
wondered
why
a
gentleman
like
crewe
should
so
far
forget
what
was
due
to
his
birth
and
position
as
to
have
offices
in
holborn
holborn
of
all
parts
of
london
but
the
awe
he
felt
for
crewe
prevented
his
seeking
information
on
the
point
from
the
only
person
who
could
give
it
to
him
so
he
served
him
and
puzzled
over
him
in
silence
his
inward
perturbation
of
spirits
being
made
manifest
occasionally
by
a
puzzled
glance
at
his
master
when
the
latter
was
not
looking
it
was
nothing
to
stork
that
his
master
was
a
famous
detective
the
problem
to
him
was
he
was
a
detective
when
he
had
no
call
to
be
one
having
more
money
than
any
man
and
let
alone
a
single
man
could
spend
in
a
lifetime
stork
coughed
slightly
to
attract
crewe
attention
if
you
please
sir
he
said
the
boy
has
come
while
crewe
was
busy
with
his
magnifying
glass
stork
returned
with
the
boy
who
had
accompanied
crewe
on
his
visit
to
riversbrook
on
the
previous
day
the
boy
a
thin
london
street
urchin
seemed
curiously
out
of
place
in
the
handsomely
furnished
office
with
his
legs
tucked
up
under
the
carved
rail
of
a
fine
old
oak
chair
and
his
big
dark
eyes
fixed
intently
on
crewe
face
the
tie
between
him
and
the
detective
was
an
unusual
one
it
dated
back
some
twelve
months
when
crewe
in
the
investigation
of
a
peculiarly
baffling
crime
found
it
advisable
to
disguise
himself
and
live
temporarily
in
a
crowded
criminal
quarter
of
islington
the
rooms
he
took
were
above
a
secondhand
clothing
shop
kept
by
a
drunken
female
named
leaver
a
supposed
widow
who
lived
at
the
back
of
the
shop
with
her
two
children
lizzie
a
girl
of
who
worked
at
a
clerkenwell
clothing
factory
and
joe
a
typical
cockney
boy
of
fourteen
who
sold
papers
in
the
streets
during
the
day
and
was
fast
qualifying
for
a
thief
at
night
when
crewe
went
to
the
place
to
live
crewe
soon
discovered
through
overhearing
a
loud
quarrel
between
his
landlady
and
her
daughter
that
leaver
husband
was
alive
though
dead
to
his
wife
for
all
practical
purposes
inasmuch
as
he
was
serving
a
life
imprisonment
for
manslaughter
a
fortnight
after
he
had
taken
up
his
temporary
quarters
above
the
shop
the
woman
was
removed
to
the
hospital
suffering
from
the
effects
of
a
hard
drinking
bout
and
died
there
the
girl
disappeared
and
the
boy
would
have
been
turned
out
on
the
streets
but
for
crewe
who
had
taken
a
liking
to
him
joe
was
alert
and
precocious
like
most
london
street
boys
but
in
addition
to
these
qualities
he
had
a
vein
of
imagination
unusual
in
a
lad
of
his
upbringing
and
environment
he
devoured
the
exciting
feuilleton
stories
in
the
evening
papers
he
vended
and
spent
his
spare
pennies
at
the
cinema
theatres
in
the
vicinity
of
his
poor
home
his
appreciation
of
the
crude
mysteries
of
the
filmed
detective
drama
amused
the
famous
expert
in
the
finer
art
of
actual
crime
detection
until
he
discovered
that
the
boy
possessed
natural
gifts
of
intuition
and
observation
combined
with
penetration
crewe
grew
interested
in
developing
the
talent
for
detective
work
when
the
lad
mother
died
crewe
decided
to
take
him
into
his
holborn
offices
as
crewe
soon
discovered
that
joe
had
a
useful
gift
for
shadowing
work
and
his
street
training
as
a
newspaper
runner
enabled
him
not
only
to
follow
a
person
through
the
thickest
of
london
traffic
but
to
escape
observation
where
a
man
might
have
been
noticed
and
suspected
well
joe
said
crewe
as
the
boy
entered
on
the
heels
of
stork
i
have
a
job
for
you
this
morning
i
want
you
to
find
the
glove
corresponding
to
this
one
crewe
having
finished
his
examination
of
the
glove
handed
it
to
the
boy
whose
first
act
was
to
slip
it
on
his
left
hand
and
move
his
fingers
about
to
assure
himself
that
they
were
in
good
working
order
in
spite
of
being
hidden
it
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
joe
had
worn
a
glove
it
was
found
in
the
room
in
which
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
murdered
continued
crewe
the
other
one
was
not
there
the
question
i
want
to
solve
is
did
it
belong
to
sir
horace
or
to
some
one
who
visited
him
on
the
night
he
was
murdered
the
police
think
it
belonged
to
sir
horace
because
it
is
the
same
size
as
the
gloves
he
wore
and
because
sir
horace
hosier
stocks
the
same
kind
as
does
nearly
every
fashionable
hosier
in
london
they
think
he
lost
the
glove
on
his
way
up
from
scotland
it
will
occur
to
you
joe
though
you
do
wear
gloves
that
it
is
more
common
for
men
to
lose
the
glove
than
the
because
the
right
hand
is
used
a
great
deal
more
than
the
left
and
even
men
who
would
not
be
seen
in
the
street
without
gloves
find
there
are
many
things
they
can
not
do
with
a
gloved
hand
for
instance
to
dive
one
hand
into
one
trouser
pocket
where
most
men
keep
their
loose
change
the
glove
has
to
be
removed
then
the
gentleman
would
take
off
his
right
glove
when
he
paid
for
his
from
pancras
said
joe
who
was
familiar
through
the
accounts
in
the
newspapers
with
the
main
details
of
the
fewbanks
mystery
right
joe
said
his
master
approvingly
and
in
that
case
he
dropped
the
glove
between
the
outside
his
front
gates
and
his
room
and
it
would
have
been
found
i
have
made
inquiries
and
i
am
satisfied
it
was
not
found
he
might
have
lost
it
when
he
was
getting
into
the
train
at
scotland
suggested
the
lad
he
had
to
change
trains
at
glasgow
he
might
have
lost
it
there
that
is
a
deduction
said
crewe
with
a
kindly
smile
it
is
good
enough
for
the
police
for
they
have
apparently
adopted
it
but
it
is
not
good
enough
for
me
what
you
do
understand
joe
is
that
an
odd
glove
is
of
no
value
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
who
wears
gloves
he
does
take
it
home
as
a
memento
of
his
carelessness
in
losing
the
other
he
throws
it
away
therefore
if
this
is
sir
horace
glove
he
took
it
home
because
he
was
unaware
that
he
had
lost
the
other
he
would
put
on
his
gloves
before
leaving
the
train
at
pancras
and
he
would
pull
off
the
one
he
was
not
when
the
was
nearing
his
home
so
as
to
be
able
to
pay
the
fare
therefore
if
it
is
sir
horace
glove
the
fellow
to
it
was
dropped
in
the
or
dropped
between
the
and
the
house
if
the
glove
had
been
lost
at
the
other
end
of
the
journey
in
scotland
sir
horace
would
have
flung
this
one
out
of
the
carriage
window
when
he
became
aware
of
the
loss
as
i
have
told
you
no
glove
was
found
between
the
gate
at
riversbrook
and
the
room
in
which
sir
horace
was
murdered
i
got
from
the
police
the
number
of
the
in
which
sir
horace
was
driven
from
pancras
and
the
driver
tells
me
that
no
glove
was
left
in
his
cab
so
what
have
we
to
do
next
joe
to
find
the
missing
glove
it
a
tough
job
ai
it
sir
yes
and
no
replied
crewe
it
is
possible
to
make
some
reasonable
safe
deductions
in
regard
to
it
these
would
indicate
what
had
happened
to
it
and
knowing
where
to
look
or
rather
in
what
circumstances
we
might
expect
to
find
it
we
might
throw
a
little
light
on
it
in
the
first
place
it
might
be
assumed
that
if
the
glove
did
not
belong
to
sir
horace
it
belonged
to
some
one
who
visited
him
on
the
night
he
returned
unexpectedly
from
scotland
that
indicates
that
his
visitor
knew
sir
horace
was
returning
a
most
important
point
for
if
he
knew
sir
horace
was
returning
he
knew
why
he
was
returning
which
no
one
else
knows
up
to
the
present
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
gather
and
in
all
probability
was
responsible
for
his
return
say
sent
him
a
letter
or
a
telegram
which
brought
him
to
london
so
we
come
to
the
possibility
of
an
angry
scene
in
the
room
in
which
sir
horace
dead
body
was
subsequently
found
we
have
the
possibility
of
the
visitor
leaving
the
house
in
a
high
state
of
excitement
hastily
snatching
up
the
hat
and
gloves
he
had
taken
off
when
he
arrived
and
in
his
excitement
dropping
unnoticed
the
glove
on
the
floor
and
leaving
his
stick
behind
him
said
joe
who
was
following
his
master
line
of
reasoning
with
keen
interest
right
joe
said
crewe
that
was
placed
in
the
stand
in
the
hall
and
when
the
visitor
left
hurriedly
was
entirely
forgotten
but
at
what
stage
did
the
visitor
become
conscious
of
the
loss
of
his
glove
not
until
his
excitement
cooled
down
a
little
how
long
he
took
to
cool
down
depends
upon
the
cause
of
his
excitement
and
his
temperament
things
which
at
present
we
can
only
guess
at
he
would
probably
walk
a
long
distance
before
he
cooled
down
then
he
would
resume
his
normal
habits
and
among
other
things
would
put
on
his
gloves
if
he
had
them
he
would
find
that
he
had
lost
one
and
that
he
had
left
his
stick
behind
he
would
know
that
the
stick
had
been
left
behind
in
the
hall
but
he
would
not
know
the
glove
had
been
dropped
in
the
house
the
probabilities
are
that
he
would
think
he
had
dropped
it
while
walking
but
if
he
felt
that
he
had
dropped
it
in
the
house
and
he
had
the
best
of
all
reasons
for
not
wishing
anyone
to
know
that
he
had
visited
sir
horace
that
night
he
would
destroy
the
remaining
glove
and
our
chance
of
tracing
it
would
be
gone
the
fact
that
he
had
left
his
stick
behind
was
a
minor
matter
that
he
could
easily
account
for
if
he
had
been
a
friend
of
sir
horace
who
had
been
in
the
habit
of
visiting
riversbrook
if
anything
cropped
up
subsequently
about
the
stick
he
could
say
that
he
had
left
it
there
before
sir
horace
closed
up
his
house
and
went
to
scotland
but
the
problem
of
the
glove
is
a
different
matter
joe
there
are
three
phases
to
it
first
if
the
visitor
thought
he
had
dropped
it
in
the
house
and
wanted
to
keep
his
visit
there
a
profound
secret
from
subsequent
inquiry
he
would
take
home
the
remaining
glove
and
destroy
it
probably
by
burning
it
secondly
if
he
thought
he
had
dropped
it
after
leaving
the
house
he
would
not
feel
that
safety
necessitated
the
destruction
of
the
remaining
one
but
he
would
probably
throw
it
away
where
it
would
not
be
likely
to
be
found
in
the
third
place
if
he
had
no
particular
reason
for
wishing
to
hide
the
fact
that
he
had
visited
riversbrook
he
would
throw
it
away
anywhere
when
he
became
conscious
that
he
had
lost
the
other
he
would
throw
it
away
merely
because
an
odd
glove
is
of
no
use
to
a
man
who
wears
gloves
the
man
who
does
wear
gloves
would
pick
up
an
odd
glove
from
the
ground
and
think
he
had
made
a
find
he
would
take
it
home
to
his
wife
and
she
would
probably
keep
it
for
for
the
children
crewe
put
down
his
notes
and
got
up
from
his
chair
your
job
is
this
joe
go
to
riversbrook
and
make
a
careful
search
on
both
sides
of
the
road
for
the
missing
glove
i
do
not
think
he
threw
it
away
if
he
did
throw
it
away
until
he
had
walked
some
distance
but
you
must
act
on
that
assumption
look
over
the
fences
of
the
houses
and
into
the
hedges
walk
along
in
the
direction
of
hampstead
underground
search
the
gutters
and
all
the
trees
and
hedges
along
the
road
take
one
side
of
the
street
to
the
underground
station
and
if
you
do
not
find
the
glove
go
back
to
riversbrook
along
the
other
side
make
a
thorough
job
of
it
as
it
is
most
important
that
the
glove
should
be
found
if
it
is
to
be
found
after
joe
had
departed
crewe
put
on
his
hat
and
left
his
office
for
the
strand
his
first
call
was
at
the
shop
of
bruden
and
marshall
hosiers
in
order
to
find
out
if
any
information
was
to
be
obtained
there
about
the
ownership
of
the
glove
he
was
aware
that
the
police
had
been
there
on
the
same
mission
but
his
experience
had
often
shown
that
valuable
information
was
to
be
gathered
after
the
police
had
been
over
the
ground
on
introducing
himself
to
the
manager
of
the
shop
that
gentleman
displayed
as
much
humble
civility
as
he
would
have
done
towards
a
valued
customer
he
could
not
say
anything
about
the
ownership
of
the
glove
which
crewe
had
brought
and
he
could
not
even
say
if
it
had
come
from
their
shop
it
was
an
excellent
glove
the
line
being
known
in
the
trade
as
reindeer
they
stocked
that
particular
kind
of
article
at
the
pair
they
had
the
pleasure
of
having
had
the
late
sir
horace
fewbanks
on
their
books
he
was
quite
an
old
account
if
he
might
use
the
expression
he
was
one
of
their
best
customers
being
a
gentleman
who
was
particular
about
his
appearance
and
who
would
have
nothing
but
the
best
in
any
line
that
he
fancied
on
the
subject
of
sir
horace
taste
in
hose
the
manager
had
much
to
say
and
in
spite
of
crewe
efforts
to
confine
the
conversation
to
gloves
the
manager
repeatedly
dragged
in
socks
he
did
it
so
frequently
that
he
became
conscious
his
visitor
was
showing
signs
of
annoyance
so
he
apologised
adding
with
an
inspiration
after
all
hose
is
really
gloves
for
the
feet
crewe
ascertained
that
a
large
number
of
legal
gentlemen
were
customers
of
bruden
and
marshall
he
innocently
suggested
that
the
reason
was
because
the
shop
was
the
nearest
one
of
its
kind
to
the
law
courts
but
this
explanation
offended
the
shopman
pride
it
was
because
they
stocked
goods
and
gave
good
value
in
every
way
combined
with
attention
and
civility
and
a
desire
to
please
that
they
did
such
an
excellent
business
with
legal
gentlemen
in
refutation
of
the
idea
that
proximity
to
the
courts
was
the
direct
reason
of
their
having
so
many
legal
gentlemen
among
their
customers
the
manager
declared
that
they
received
orders
from
all
parts
of
the
world
india
canada
australia
and
south
africa
to
say
nothing
of
american
gentlemen
who
liked
their
hosiery
to
have
the
london
their
orders
from
the
colonies
came
from
gentlemen
who
found
that
these
things
in
the
colonies
were
not
what
they
had
been
used
to
and
so
they
sent
their
orders
to
bruden
and
marshall
crewe
interest
was
in
the
legal
customers
and
he
asked
for
the
names
of
some
the
manager
ran
through
a
list
of
names
of
judges
barristers
and
solicitors
but
the
name
crewe
wanted
to
hear
was
not
among
them
he
was
compelled
to
include
the
name
among
half
a
dozen
others
he
mentioned
to
the
manager
he
ascertained
that
charles
holymead
was
a
customer
of
the
firm
but
it
was
apparent
from
the
manager
spiritless
attitude
towards
holymead
that
the
famous
was
not
a
man
who
ran
up
a
big
bill
with
his
hosier
or
was
very
particular
about
what
he
wore
the
world
regarded
some
of
the
men
of
this
type
famous
or
distinguished
but
in
the
hosier
mind
they
were
all
classed
as
commonplace
but
the
manager
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
holymead
would
not
buy
such
a
glove
as
that
which
crewe
had
brought
in
he
might
and
he
might
not
but
as
a
general
rule
he
did
not
pay
more
than
for
his
gloves
crewe
took
a
taxi
to
princes
gate
in
order
to
have
a
look
at
the
house
in
which
holymead
lived
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
holymead
was
not
particular
about
what
he
spent
on
his
clothes
he
was
extravagant
about
the
amount
he
spent
in
house
rent
of
course
a
leading
barrister
earning
a
huge
income
could
afford
to
live
in
a
palatial
residence
in
princes
gate
but
it
was
not
the
locality
or
residence
that
an
man
would
have
chosen
for
his
home
but
crewe
had
little
doubt
that
the
beautiful
wife
holymead
possessed
was
responsible
for
the
choice
of
house
and
locality
after
looking
at
the
house
crewe
walked
back
to
the
at
hyde
park
corner
he
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
it
was
necessary
to
settle
beyond
doubt
whether
the
had
visited
riversbrook
the
night
sir
horace
had
returned
from
scotland
if
the
had
done
so
he
was
anxious
to
keep
the
visit
secret
for
not
only
had
he
not
informed
the
police
of
his
visit
but
he
had
kept
it
from
miss
fewbanks
crewe
had
ascertained
from
miss
fewbanks
that
holymead
when
he
had
called
at
riversbrook
on
a
visit
of
condolence
had
not
mentioned
to
her
anything
about
having
left
his
stick
in
the
hall
stand
on
a
previous
visit
on
leaving
miss
fewbanks
holymead
had
gone
up
to
the
hall
stand
and
taken
both
his
hat
and
stick
as
if
he
had
left
them
both
there
a
few
minutes
before
crewe
reasoned
that
if
holymead
had
gone
out
to
see
sir
horace
fewbanks
at
riversbrook
and
had
desired
to
keep
his
visit
a
secret
he
would
not
have
taken
a
cab
at
hyde
park
corner
to
hampstead
but
would
have
travelled
by
underground
railway
or
omnibus
in
all
probability
the
tube
had
been
used
because
of
its
speed
being
more
in
harmony
with
the
feelings
of
a
man
impatient
to
get
done
with
a
subject
so
important
that
sir
horace
had
been
recalled
from
scotland
to
deal
with
it
he
would
leave
the
tube
at
hampstead
and
take
a
he
would
not
be
likely
to
go
straight
to
riversbrook
in
the
if
he
were
anxious
that
his
movements
should
not
be
traced
subsequently
he
would
dismiss
the
at
one
of
the
hotels
bordering
on
hampstead
heath
for
they
were
the
resort
of
hundreds
of
visitors
on
summer
nights
and
his
actions
would
thus
easily
escape
notice
from
the
hotel
he
would
walk
across
to
riversbrook
but
the
return
journey
would
be
made
in
a
somewhat
different
way
if
holymead
left
riversbrook
in
a
state
of
excitement
he
would
walk
a
long
way
without
being
conscious
of
the
exertion
he
would
want
to
be
alone
with
his
own
thoughts
gradually
he
would
cool
down
and
becoming
conscious
of
his
surroundings
would
make
his
way
home
again
he
would
use
the
tube
for
it
would
be
more
difficult
for
his
movements
to
be
traced
if
he
mixed
with
a
crowd
of
travellers
than
if
he
took
a
cab
to
his
home
it
was
impossible
to
say
what
station
he
got
in
at
for
that
would
depend
on
how
far
he
walked
before
he
cooled
down
but
he
would
be
sure
to
get
out
at
hyde
park
corner
because
that
was
the
station
nearest
to
his
house
allowing
for
a
temperamental
reaction
during
a
train
journey
of
about
twenty
minutes
he
would
feel
depressed
and
weary
and
would
probably
take
a
outside
hyde
park
station
to
his
home
that
was
a
thing
he
would
often
be
in
the
habit
of
doing
when
returning
late
at
night
from
the
theatre
or
elsewhere
and
therefore
could
be
easily
explained
by
him
if
the
police
happened
to
make
inquiries
as
to
his
movements
as
crewe
anticipated
he
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
driver
of
the
in
which
holymead
had
driven
home
on
the
night
of
wednesday
last
the
frequently
used
cabs
and
he
was
to
all
the
drivers
on
the
rank
crewe
got
into
the
cab
he
had
used
and
ordered
the
man
to
drive
him
to
his
office
and
there
invited
him
upstairs
he
adopted
this
course
because
he
knew
that
the
driver
who
gave
his
name
as
taylor
would
be
more
likely
to
talk
freely
in
an
office
where
he
could
not
be
overheard
than
he
would
do
on
the
with
his
crowding
him
or
in
an
hotel
parlour
where
other
people
were
present
tell
me
exactly
what
happened
when
you
drove
holymead
home
on
wednesday
night
said
crewe
did
you
notice
anything
strange
about
him
or
was
his
manner
much
the
same
as
on
other
occasions
that
he
used
your
cab
well
i
do
see
whether
i
should
tell
you
whether
he
was
or
whether
he
was
replied
the
driver
who
was
as
surly
as
most
of
his
class
what
it
to
do
with
you
anyway
he
a
regular
customer
of
mine
on
the
rank
and
he
not
one
of
your
tuppenny
tipsters
either
he
a
gentleman
and
if
he
got
to
know
that
i
had
been
telling
tales
about
him
it
would
not
do
me
any
good
it
would
not
replied
crewe
with
cordial
acquiescence
therefore
taylor
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
not
to
mention
anything
you
tell
me
furthermore
i
see
that
you
do
lose
by
it
now
or
at
any
other
time
i
can
not
say
more
than
that
but
that
a
great
deal
more
than
the
police
would
say
now
would
you
sooner
tell
me
or
tell
the
police
here
a
sovereign
to
start
with
and
if
you
have
an
interesting
story
to
tell
you
have
another
one
before
you
leave
the
appeal
of
money
and
the
conviction
that
the
police
would
use
less
considerate
methods
if
crewe
passed
him
over
to
them
abolished
scruples
about
discussing
a
fare
and
it
was
in
a
much
less
surly
tone
that
he
responded
i
did
notice
anything
strange
about
him
when
he
called
me
off
the
rank
but
i
did
afterwards
first
of
all
i
did
drive
him
home
that
is
i
did
drive
him
home
but
he
did
go
inside
when
i
drew
up
outside
his
house
in
princes
gate
i
looked
around
expecting
to
see
him
get
out
as
he
did
move
i
got
down
and
opened
the
door
you
getting
out
here
sir
i
said
in
a
soft
voice
he
said
on
is
your
house
sir
i
ventured
to
say
not
going
in
he
replied
on
i
was
surprised
i
thought
he
was
the
worse
for
drink
and
i
never
seen
him
that
way
before
but
some
gentlemen
are
so
obstinate
in
liquor
that
you
ca
get
them
to
do
anything
except
the
opposite
of
what
you
ask
them
i
thought
i
try
and
coax
him
go
inside
sir
i
said
be
better
off
in
bed
you
think
i
am
drunk
he
said
sharply
you
could
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
he
was
as
sober
as
a
judge
all
in
a
moment
sir
i
did
i
said
would
take
the
liberty
i
said
get
back
on
your
seat
and
drive
me
to
the
hyde
park
hotel
no
i
think
i
go
to
verney
but
do
go
there
direct
drive
me
round
the
park
first
i
feel
i
want
a
breath
of
cool
air
go
on
said
crewe
in
a
tone
which
indicated
approval
of
method
of
telling
his
story
well
i
turned
the
cab
round
and
drove
through
the
park
but
i
was
puzzled
about
him
and
looked
back
at
him
once
or
twice
pretending
that
i
was
looking
to
see
if
a
cab
or
car
was
coming
up
behind
and
as
we
passed
over
the
serpentine
bridge
i
saw
him
throw
something
out
of
the
window
a
glove
suggested
crewe
quickly
the
driver
looked
at
him
in
profound
admiration
well
if
you
do
beat
all
the
detectives
i
ever
heard
of
he
tried
to
throw
it
in
the
water
continued
crewe
as
if
explaining
the
matter
to
himself
rather
than
to
his
visitor
did
you
get
it
hold
on
a
bit
said
taylor
who
had
his
own
ideas
of
how
to
give
value
for
the
extra
sovereign
he
hoped
to
obtain
i
could
see
what
it
was
he
had
thrown
away
and
of
course
i
could
pull
up
to
find
out
i
drove
on
but
i
kept
my
eye
on
him
though
i
had
my
back
to
him
as
we
were
driving
back
along
the
broad
walk
i
had
another
look
at
him
and
bless
me
if
he
was
crying
crying
like
a
child
he
had
his
hands
up
to
his
face
and
his
head
was
shaking
as
if
he
was
sobbing
i
said
to
myself
barmy
he
gone
off
his
rocker
i
thought
to
myself
i
ought
to
drive
him
to
the
police
station
but
i
reckoned
it
was
none
of
my
business
after
all
so
i
take
him
to
verney
and
be
done
with
it
so
i
drove
to
verney
he
got
out
and
paid
me
but
i
could
see
that
he
had
been
crying
and
he
looked
much
as
usual
so
far
as
i
could
see
i
thought
to
myself
that
perhaps
after
all
he
only
had
a
queer
turn
however
i
said
to
myself
i
drive
back
to
the
bridge
and
see
what
thrown
out
of
the
window
it
a
glove
sure
enough
it
had
fallen
just
below
the
railing
i
looked
about
for
the
other
one
but
i
find
it
so
i
suppose
it
must
have
fallen
into
the
water
no
it
did
said
crewe
i
have
it
here
he
opened
a
drawer
in
his
desk
and
produced
a
glove
it
was
a
glove
you
found
just
look
at
this
one
and
see
if
it
corresponds
to
the
one
you
picked
up
taylor
looked
at
the
glove
they
as
like
as
two
peas
he
said
what
did
you
do
with
the
one
you
found
inquired
crewe
i
hope
you
did
throw
it
away
i
not
a
fool
retorted
taylor
i
had
odd
gloves
left
in
my
cab
before
i
kept
this
one
thinking
that
sooner
or
later
somebody
might
leave
another
like
it
and
then
i
have
a
pair
for
nothing
well
i
buy
it
from
you
said
crewe
have
you
anything
more
to
tell
me
i
went
back
to
the
rank
and
one
of
the
chaps
was
curious
that
i
been
so
long
away
for
he
knew
that
holymead
place
is
more
than
ten
minutes
drive
from
the
station
but
he
got
nothing
out
of
me
i
know
how
to
keep
my
mouth
shut
you
the
first
man
i
told
what
happened
and
i
hope
you
wo
give
me
away
i
already
promised
you
that
said
crewe
flipping
another
sovereign
from
his
sovereign
case
and
handing
it
to
taylor
and
i
give
you
five
shillings
for
the
glove
taylor
looked
at
him
darkly
five
shillings
is
much
for
a
glove
like
that
he
said
insolently
what
about
my
loss
of
time
going
home
for
it
i
suppose
you
pay
the
for
the
run
down
from
hyde
park
no
i
wo
said
crewe
cheerfully
then
i
do
see
why
i
should
bring
it
for
a
paltry
five
shillings
said
taylor
if
you
want
the
glove
you
have
to
pay
for
it
but
i
do
want
the
glove
said
crewe
who
disliked
being
made
the
victim
of
extortion
what
made
you
think
so
i
sell
you
this
one
for
five
shillings
we
may
as
well
do
a
deal
of
some
kind
it
is
no
use
each
of
us
having
one
glove
what
do
you
say
taylor
will
you
buy
mine
for
five
shillings
or
shall
i
buy
yours
taylor
smiled
sourly
you
a
deep
one
he
said
here
the
other
glove
he
dipped
his
hand
into
the
deep
pocket
of
his
driving
coat
and
produced
a
glove
i
suppose
you
knew
i
have
it
on
me
five
shillings
and
it
yours
the
pair
are
worth
about
five
shillings
to
me
said
crewe
as
he
paid
over
the
money
do
you
remember
what
time
it
was
when
holymead
engaged
you
at
hyde
park
eleven
you
are
quite
sure
as
to
the
time
i
heard
one
of
the
big
clocks
striking
as
he
was
getting
into
my
cab
taylor
took
his
departure
and
crewe
after
wrapping
up
the
glove
which
he
had
to
return
to
inspector
chippenfield
put
the
other
one
in
his
safe
we
are
getting
on
he
said
in
a
pleased
tone
this
means
a
trip
to
scotland
but
i
wait
until
the
inquest
is
over
chapter
ix
at
the
inquest
on
the
body
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
which
was
held
at
the
hampstead
police
court
there
was
an
odd
mixture
of
classes
in
the
crowd
that
thronged
that
portion
of
the
court
in
which
the
public
were
allowed
to
congregate
the
accounts
of
the
crime
which
had
been
published
in
the
press
and
the
atmosphere
of
mystery
which
enshrouded
the
violent
death
of
one
of
the
most
prominent
of
his
majesty
judges
had
stirred
the
public
curiosity
and
therefore
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
every
one
was
supposed
to
be
out
of
town
in
august
the
attendance
at
the
court
included
a
sprinkling
of
ladies
of
the
fashionable
world
and
their
escorts
both
branches
of
the
legal
profession
were
numerously
represented
all
of
the
victim
judicial
colleagues
were
out
of
town
and
though
some
of
them
intended
as
a
mark
of
respect
for
the
dead
man
to
come
up
for
the
funeral
which
was
to
take
place
two
days
later
they
were
too
familiar
with
legal
procedure
to
feel
curiosity
as
to
the
working
of
the
machinery
at
a
preliminary
inquiry
into
the
crime
they
were
emphatic
among
their
friends
on
the
degeneracy
of
these
days
which
rendered
possible
such
an
outrageous
crime
as
the
murder
of
a
high
court
judge
the
fact
that
it
was
without
precedent
in
the
history
of
british
law
added
to
its
enormity
in
the
eyes
of
gentlemen
who
had
been
trained
to
worship
precedent
as
the
only
safe
guide
through
the
shifting
quicksands
of
life
they
were
insistent
on
the
urgency
of
the
murderer
being
arrested
and
handed
over
to
justice
in
the
person
of
the
hangman
for
as
each
asked
himself
where
was
this
sort
of
crime
to
end
in
spite
of
the
degeneracy
of
the
times
they
were
reluctant
to
believe
in
such
a
supposition
as
the
existence
of
a
band
of
criminals
who
in
revenge
for
the
judicial
sentences
imposed
on
members
of
their
class
had
sworn
to
exterminate
the
whole
of
his
majesty
judges
but
until
the
murderer
was
apprehended
and
the
reason
for
the
crime
was
discovered
it
was
impossible
to
say
that
the
english
judicature
would
not
soon
be
called
upon
to
supply
other
victims
to
criminal
violence
the
murder
of
a
judge
seemed
to
them
a
particularly
atrocious
crime
in
the
punishment
of
which
the
law
might
honourably
sacrifice
temporarily
its
reputation
for
delay
the
bar
was
represented
chiefly
by
junior
members
the
senior
members
were
able
to
make
full
use
of
the
long
vacation
spending
it
at
health
resorts
or
in
the
country
but
the
incomes
of
the
young
shoots
of
the
great
parasitical
profession
did
not
permit
them
to
enjoy
more
than
a
brief
holiday
out
of
town
of
course
it
would
never
have
done
for
them
to
admit
even
to
each
other
that
they
could
not
afford
to
go
away
for
an
extended
holiday
and
therefore
they
told
one
another
in
bored
tones
that
they
had
not
been
able
to
make
up
their
minds
where
to
go
the
junior
bar
included
old
men
who
through
lack
of
influence
want
of
energy
want
of
advertisement
want
of
ability
or
some
other
deficiency
had
never
earned
more
than
a
few
guineas
at
their
profession
though
they
had
spent
year
after
year
in
chambers
they
lived
on
scanty
private
means
broken
in
spirit
they
had
even
ceased
to
attend
the
courts
in
order
to
study
the
methods
and
learn
the
tricks
of
successful
counsel
but
the
murder
of
a
high
court
judge
was
a
thing
which
stirred
even
their
sluggish
blood
and
in
the
hope
of
some
sensational
development
they
had
put
on
faded
silk
hats
and
shabby
black
suits
and
gone
out
to
hampstead
to
attend
the
inquest
the
interest
of
the
junior
bar
in
the
crime
was
as
personal
as
that
of
the
members
of
the
judicial
bench
though
it
manifested
itself
in
an
entirely
different
direction
they
speculated
among
themselves
as
to
who
would
be
appointed
to
the
vacancy
on
the
high
court
bench
a
leading
with
a
political
pull
would
of
course
be
selected
by
the
but
there
were
several
who
possessed
these
qualifications
and
therefore
there
was
room
for
differences
of
opinion
among
the
junior
bar
as
to
who
would
get
the
offer
the
point
on
which
they
were
all
united
was
that
vacancies
of
the
high
court
bench
were
a
good
thing
for
the
bar
as
a
whole
for
they
removed
leading
and
the
dispersion
of
their
practice
was
like
rain
on
parched
ground
metaphorically
speaking
every
one
including
even
the
junior
bar
had
the
chance
of
getting
a
shove
up
when
a
leading
accepted
a
judicial
appointment
some
of
the
more
irreverent
spirits
among
the
junior
bar
in
drawing
attention
to
the
fact
that
sir
horace
fewbanks
had
been
one
of
the
youngest
members
of
the
high
court
bench
expressed
the
hope
that
the
shock
of
his
death
would
be
felt
by
some
of
the
extremely
aged
members
of
the
bench
who
were
too
infirm
in
health
to
be
able
to
stand
many
shocks
the
members
of
the
junior
bar
chatted
with
the
representatives
of
the
lower
branch
of
the
profession
who
ranged
from
articled
clerks
whose
young
souls
had
not
been
entirely
dried
up
by
association
with
parchment
to
hard
old
delvers
in
dusty
documents
who
had
lived
so
long
in
the
legal
atmosphere
of
quibbling
obstruction
and
deceit
that
they
were
as
incapable
of
an
honest
impetuous
act
as
of
an
illegal
one
the
gossip
concerning
the
murdered
judge
in
which
the
two
branches
of
the
profession
joined
had
reference
to
his
moral
character
in
legal
circles
there
had
always
been
gossip
of
the
kind
in
his
sir
horace
judicial
reputation
was
beyond
reproach
and
he
had
known
his
law
a
great
deal
better
than
most
of
his
judicial
colleagues
comparatively
few
of
his
decisions
had
been
upset
on
appeal
but
every
one
about
the
courts
knew
that
he
was
susceptible
to
a
pretty
feminine
face
and
a
good
figure
many
were
the
conflicts
that
arose
in
court
between
bench
and
bar
as
the
result
of
justice
fewbanks
habit
of
protecting
pretty
witnesses
from
questions
which
he
regarded
as
outside
the
case
there
was
no
suggestion
that
his
judicial
decisions
were
influenced
by
the
good
looks
of
ladies
who
were
parties
to
the
cases
heard
by
him
but
there
were
rumours
that
on
occasions
the
relations
between
the
judge
and
a
pretty
witness
begun
in
court
had
ripened
into
something
at
which
moral
men
might
well
shake
their
heads
while
the
members
of
the
legal
profession
struggled
to
obtain
seats
in
the
body
of
the
court
an
entirely
different
class
of
spectators
struggled
to
get
into
the
gallery
for
the
most
part
they
were
badly
dressed
men
who
needed
a
shave
but
there
were
a
few
men
among
them
and
also
a
few
ladies
detective
rolfe
took
a
professional
interest
in
the
occupants
of
the
gallery
what
a
collection
of
crooks
he
whispered
to
inspector
chippenfield
a
regular
rogues
gallery
look
there
is
george
it
is
time
he
was
in
again
and
behind
him
is
that
cunning
old
ikey
samuels
i
wish
we
could
get
him
look
at
the
other
end
of
the
first
row
is
that
jim
i
hardly
knew
him
he
grown
a
beard
since
he
been
out
we
soon
have
it
off
again
for
him
he
got
the
impudence
to
scowl
at
us
he
lay
for
you
one
of
these
nights
inspector
the
judicial
duties
of
the
murdered
man
had
been
concerned
chiefly
with
civil
cases
at
the
royal
courts
of
justice
but
when
the
criminal
calendar
had
been
heavy
he
had
often
presided
at
number
one
court
at
the
old
bailey
it
was
this
fact
which
had
given
the
criminal
class
a
sort
of
personal
interest
in
his
murder
and
accounted
for
the
presence
of
many
criminals
who
happened
to
be
out
of
gaol
at
the
time
the
spectators
in
the
gallery
included
men
whom
the
murdered
man
had
sentenced
and
men
who
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
escape
being
sentenced
by
him
owing
to
the
vagaries
of
juries
there
were
pickpockets
sneak
thieves
confidence
men
burglars
and
receivers
among
the
occupants
of
the
gallery
and
many
of
them
had
brought
with
them
the
ladies
who
assisted
them
professionally
or
presided
over
their
homes
when
they
were
not
in
gaol
i
would
be
surprised
if
the
man
we
want
is
among
that
bunch
said
rolfe
to
inspector
chippenfield
you
a
lot
to
learn
about
them
my
boy
said
his
superior
there
is
crewe
up
among
them
continued
rolfe
i
wonder
what
he
thinks
he
after
inspector
chippenfield
gave
a
glance
in
the
direction
of
crewe
but
did
not
deign
to
give
any
sign
of
recognition
the
fact
that
crewe
by
his
presence
in
the
gallery
seemed
to
entertain
the
idea
that
the
murderer
might
be
found
among
the
occupants
of
that
part
of
the
court
could
not
be
as
lightly
dismissed
as
rolfe
vague
suggestion
it
annoyed
inspector
chippenfield
to
think
that
crewe
might
be
nearer
at
the
moment
to
the
murderer
than
he
himself
was
even
though
that
proximity
was
merely
physical
and
unsupported
by
evidence
or
even
by
any
theory
it
would
have
been
a
great
relief
to
him
if
he
had
known
that
crewe
object
in
going
to
the
gallery
was
not
to
mix
with
the
criminal
classes
but
in
order
to
keep
a
careful
survey
of
what
took
place
in
the
body
of
the
court
without
making
himself
too
prominent
holymead
arrived
and
members
of
the
junior
bar
deferentially
made
room
for
him
he
shook
hands
with
some
of
these
gentlemen
and
also
with
inspector
chippenfield
much
to
the
gratification
of
that
officer
miss
fewbanks
arrived
in
a
a
few
minutes
before
the
appointed
hour
of
eleven
she
was
accompanied
by
holymead
and
they
were
shown
into
a
private
room
by
flack
who
had
received
instructions
from
inspector
chippenfield
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
the
murdered
man
daughter
miss
fewbanks
and
holymead
had
been
almost
inseparable
since
the
tragedy
had
been
discovered
immediately
on
the
arrival
of
miss
fewbanks
from
dellmere
holymead
had
gone
out
to
riversbrook
to
condole
with
her
and
to
support
her
in
her
great
sorrow
but
the
murdered
daughter
who
on
account
of
having
lived
apart
from
her
father
had
developed
a
spirit
seemed
to
be
less
overcome
by
the
horror
of
the
tragedy
than
holymead
was
it
was
with
a
feeling
that
there
was
something
lacking
in
her
own
nature
that
the
girl
realised
that
holymead
grief
for
the
violent
death
of
a
man
who
had
been
her
husband
dearest
friend
was
greater
than
her
own
grief
at
the
loss
of
a
father
one
of
the
directions
in
which
holymead
grief
found
expression
was
in
a
feverish
desire
to
know
all
that
was
being
done
to
discover
the
murderer
she
displayed
continuous
interest
in
the
investigations
of
the
detectives
engaged
on
the
case
and
she
had
implored
miss
fewbanks
to
let
her
know
when
any
important
discovery
was
made
she
applauded
the
action
of
her
young
friend
in
engaging
such
a
famous
detective
as
crewe
and
declared
that
if
anyone
could
unravel
the
mystery
crewe
would
do
it
she
had
been
particularly
anxious
to
hear
through
miss
fewbanks
what
impressions
were
with
regard
to
the
tragedy
the
court
was
opened
punctually
the
coroner
being
bodyman
a
stout
gentleman
who
had
spent
thirty
years
of
his
life
in
the
stuffy
atmosphere
of
police
courts
hearing
cases
seldon
nodded
in
reply
to
the
inquiring
glance
of
the
coroner
and
the
inquest
was
opened
the
first
witness
was
miss
fewbanks
she
was
dressed
in
deep
black
and
was
obviously
a
little
unnerved
in
a
low
tone
she
said
she
had
identified
the
body
as
that
of
her
father
she
was
staying
at
her
father
country
house
in
dellmere
sussex
when
the
crime
was
committed
she
had
no
knowledge
of
anyone
who
was
evilly
disposed
towards
her
father
he
had
never
spoken
to
her
of
anyone
who
cherished
a
grudge
against
him
evidence
relating
to
the
circumstances
in
which
the
body
was
found
was
given
by
flack
he
described
the
position
of
the
room
in
which
the
body
was
found
and
the
attitude
in
which
the
body
was
stretched
he
was
on
duty
in
the
neighbourhood
of
tanton
gardens
on
the
night
of
the
murder
but
saw
no
suspicious
characters
and
heard
no
sounds
the
evidence
of
hill
was
chiefly
a
repetition
of
what
he
had
told
inspector
chippenfield
as
to
his
movements
on
the
day
of
the
crime
and
his
methods
of
inspecting
the
premises
three
times
a
week
in
accordance
with
his
master
orders
he
knew
nothing
about
sir
horace
sudden
return
from
scotland
his
first
knowledge
of
this
was
the
account
of
the
murder
which
he
read
in
the
papers
inspector
chippenfield
gave
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
producing
the
letter
received
at
scotland
yard
announcing
that
sir
horace
fewbanks
had
been
murdered
the
letter
was
passed
up
to
the
coroner
for
his
inspection
and
when
he
had
examined
it
he
sent
it
to
the
foreman
of
the
jury
then
followed
medical
evidence
which
showed
that
death
was
due
to
a
bullet
wound
and
could
not
have
been
the
coroner
in
his
dwelt
upon
the
loss
sustained
by
the
judiciary
by
the
violent
death
of
one
of
its
most
distinguished
members
and
the
jury
after
a
retirement
of
a
few
minutes
brought
in
a
verdict
of
wilful
murder
by
some
person
or
persons
unknown
as
the
occupants
of
the
court
filed
out
into
the
street
crewe
who
was
watching
holymead
noticed
the
give
a
slight
start
when
he
saw
miss
fewbanks
and
his
wife
holymead
went
up
to
the
ladies
and
shook
hands
with
miss
fewbanks
and
to
crewe
it
seemed
as
if
he
was
on
the
point
of
shaking
hands
with
his
wife
but
he
stopped
himself
awkwardly
he
saw
the
ladies
into
their
cab
and
raising
his
hat
went
off
as
holymead
had
seen
miss
fewbanks
in
court
when
she
gave
evidence
it
was
obvious
to
crewe
that
he
could
not
have
been
surprised
at
meeting
her
outside
it
was
therefore
the
presence
of
his
wife
which
had
surprised
him
that
fact
if
it
were
a
fact
opened
a
limitless
field
of
speculation
to
crewe
but
in
spite
of
the
possibility
of
error
a
possibility
which
he
frankly
recognised
he
was
pleased
with
himself
for
having
noticed
the
incident
to
him
it
seemed
to
provide
another
link
in
the
chain
he
was
constructing
it
harmonised
with
taylor
story
of
decision
to
stay
at
verney
instead
of
entering
his
own
home
the
night
taylor
drove
him
from
hyde
park
corner
rolfe
also
possessed
the
professional
faculty
of
observation
but
in
a
different
degree
he
had
seen
holymead
talking
to
his
wife
and
miss
fewbanks
but
he
had
noticed
nothing
but
gentlemanly
ease
in
the
barrister
manner
what
did
astonish
him
in
connection
with
holymead
was
that
after
he
had
left
the
ladies
and
was
walking
in
the
direction
of
the
he
spoke
to
one
of
the
former
occupants
of
the
gallery
this
was
a
man
known
to
the
police
and
his
associates
as
kincher
his
name
was
kemp
and
how
he
had
obtained
his
was
not
known
he
was
a
criminal
by
profession
and
had
undergone
several
heavy
sentences
for
burglary
he
was
a
man
of
medium
height
about
fifty
years
of
age
apart
from
a
rather
heavy
lower
jaw
he
gave
no
external
indication
of
his
professional
pursuits
but
looked
with
his
brown
and
face
and
rough
blue
reefer
suit
not
unlike
a
seafaring
man
the
likeness
was
heightened
by
a
tattooed
device
which
covered
the
back
of
his
right
hand
and
a
slight
roll
in
his
gait
when
he
walked
but
appearances
are
deceptive
for
kemp
at
liberty
or
in
gaol
had
never
been
out
of
london
in
his
life
he
was
born
and
bred
a
london
thief
and
had
served
all
his
sentences
at
wormwood
scrubbs
for
over
a
minute
he
and
holymead
remained
in
conversation
rolfe
would
have
described
it
officially
as
familiar
conversation
but
that
description
would
have
overlooked
the
deference
the
sense
of
inferiority
in
kincher
manner
for
a
time
rolfe
was
puzzled
by
the
incident
but
he
eventually
lighted
on
an
explanation
which
satisfied
himself
it
was
that
in
the
earlier
days
before
holymead
had
reached
such
a
prominent
position
at
the
bar
he
had
been
engaged
in
practice
in
the
criminal
courts
and
kincher
had
been
one
of
his
clients
with
a
cheerful
smile
holymead
brought
the
conversation
to
an
end
and
went
on
his
way
kemp
walked
on
hurriedly
in
the
opposite
direction
he
had
his
eyes
on
a
young
man
whom
he
had
seen
in
the
gallery
and
who
had
seemed
to
avoid
his
eye
it
was
obvious
to
him
that
this
young
man
for
whom
he
had
been
on
the
watch
when
holymead
spoke
to
him
had
seized
the
opportunity
to
slip
past
him
while
he
was
talking
to
the
eminent
the
young
man
even
from
the
back
view
seemed
to
be
hallo
fred
exclaimed
kemp
as
he
reached
within
a
yard
or
two
of
his
quarry
hallo
kincher
replied
the
young
man
turning
round
i
did
notice
you
were
you
up
at
the
court
yes
i
looked
in
said
kemp
there
was
much
doing
was
there
no
said
fred
he
wo
trouble
us
any
more
pursued
kemp
no
the
young
man
seemed
to
have
a
dread
of
helping
along
the
conversation
and
therefore
sought
refuge
in
monosyllables
kemp
coughed
before
he
formed
his
question
did
you
go
up
there
that
night
no
the
reply
came
instantaneously
but
the
young
man
followed
it
up
with
a
look
of
inquiry
to
ascertain
if
his
denial
was
believed
a
good
thing
as
it
happened
said
kemp
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
fred
earnestly
i
never
said
you
had
replied
kemp
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
continued
the
young
man
with
emphasis
that
not
my
sort
of
game
i
not
saying
anything
fred
replied
the
elder
man
but
whoever
done
it
might
have
done
it
by
accident
or
no
accident
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
thank
god
that
is
all
right
fred
i
not
saying
you
know
anything
about
it
but
even
if
you
did
you
find
i
could
be
trusted
i
do
go
blabbing
round
to
everybody
i
know
you
do
but
as
i
said
before
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
did
go
there
that
night
i
changed
my
mind
a
very
lucky
thing
then
because
if
they
do
look
you
up
you
can
prove
an
alibi
yes
said
fred
i
can
prove
an
alibi
easy
enough
but
what
makes
you
talk
about
them
looking
me
up
why
should
they
get
into
me
why
should
they
look
me
up
i
told
you
i
did
go
there
that
is
all
right
fred
said
the
other
in
a
soothing
tone
if
that
pal
of
yours
keeps
his
mouth
shut
there
is
nothing
to
put
them
on
your
tracks
but
i
do
like
the
looks
of
him
he
seems
to
me
a
bit
nervous
and
if
they
put
him
through
the
third
degree
he
squeak
that
my
impression
if
he
squeaks
he
have
to
settle
with
me
said
fred
and
he
find
there
is
something
to
pay
if
he
tries
to
put
me
away
i
i
do
him
in
kincher
instead
of
being
horrified
at
this
sentiment
seemed
to
approve
of
it
as
the
right
thing
to
be
done
i
let
him
know
if
i
was
you
fred
he
said
i
did
like
the
look
of
him
the
reason
i
came
out
here
was
to
have
a
look
at
him
and
when
i
saw
him
in
the
box
i
said
to
myself
i
glad
i
staked
nothing
on
you
for
it
seems
to
me
that
you
crack
up
if
the
police
shake
their
in
your
face
i
felt
glad
i
had
accepted
your
invitation
to
make
it
a
job
fred
it
was
the
fact
that
some
one
else
i
never
seen
had
put
up
the
job
that
kept
me
out
of
it
when
you
asked
me
to
go
with
you
a
man
ca
be
too
careful
especially
after
he
had
a
long
spell
in
but
of
course
you
all
right
if
you
changed
your
mind
and
did
go
up
there
but
if
i
was
you
i
have
my
alibi
ready
it
is
no
good
leaving
things
until
the
police
are
at
the
door
and
making
one
up
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
yes
i
see
about
it
said
fred
it
a
good
idea
come
in
and
have
a
drink
fred
said
kincher
it
will
do
you
good
it
was
dry
work
listening
to
them
talking
up
there
about
the
murder
fred
accompanied
kemp
into
the
bar
of
the
hotel
they
reached
and
the
elder
man
after
an
inquiring
glance
at
his
companion
ordered
two
whiskies
kincher
added
water
to
the
contents
of
each
glass
and
lifting
his
glass
in
his
right
hand
waited
until
fred
had
done
the
same
and
then
said
well
here
luck
and
long
life
to
the
man
that
did
it
whoever
he
is
fred
offered
no
objection
to
this
sentiment
and
they
drained
glasses
chapter
x
and
so
you
had
no
luck
rolfe
inspector
chippenfield
glancing
up
from
his
official
desk
in
scotland
yard
put
this
question
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
suggested
that
the
speaker
had
expected
nothing
better
i
seen
the
heads
of
at
least
half
a
dozen
likely
west
end
shops
rolfe
replied
and
they
tell
me
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
where
the
handkerchief
was
bought
the
scrap
of
lace
merely
shows
that
it
was
torn
off
a
good
handkerchief
but
there
is
nothing
about
it
to
show
that
the
handkerchief
was
different
in
any
marked
way
from
the
average
filmy
scrap
of
muslin
and
lace
which
every
smart
woman
carries
as
a
handkerchief
i
thought
so
myself
before
i
started
to
make
inquiries
well
rolfe
we
must
come
at
it
another
way
said
the
inspector
undoubtedly
there
is
a
woman
in
the
case
and
it
ought
not
to
be
impossible
to
locate
her
your
theory
rolfe
is
that
the
murder
was
committed
by
some
one
who
broke
into
the
place
while
sir
horace
was
entertaining
a
lady
friend
or
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
a
lady
he
expected
either
the
lady
had
not
arrived
or
had
left
the
room
temporarily
when
the
burglar
broke
into
the
house
he
had
spotted
the
place
some
days
before
and
ascertained
that
it
was
empty
and
when
he
found
that
sir
horace
had
returned
alone
he
decided
to
break
in
and
covering
sir
horace
with
a
revolver
try
to
extort
money
from
him
a
riskier
but
more
profitable
game
than
burgling
an
empty
house
if
it
came
off
with
his
revolver
in
his
hand
he
made
his
way
up
to
the
library
sir
horace
parleyed
with
him
until
he
could
reach
his
own
revolver
and
then
got
in
the
first
shot
but
missed
his
man
the
burglar
shot
him
and
then
bolted
the
lady
heard
the
shots
and
rushing
in
found
sir
horace
in
his
death
agony
she
was
stooping
over
him
with
her
handkerchief
in
her
hand
and
in
his
convulsive
moments
he
caught
hold
of
a
corner
of
it
and
the
handkerchief
was
torn
the
lady
left
the
place
and
on
arrival
home
concocted
that
letter
which
was
sent
here
telling
us
that
sir
horace
had
been
murdered
is
that
it
yes
assented
rolfe
of
course
i
do
lay
it
down
that
everything
happened
just
as
you
said
but
that
my
idea
of
the
crime
it
accounts
for
all
the
clues
we
picked
up
and
that
is
something
it
is
an
ingenious
theory
and
it
does
you
credit
said
the
inspector
who
had
not
forgotten
that
he
had
proposed
to
rolfe
that
they
should
help
one
another
to
the
extent
of
taking
one
another
fully
into
each
confidence
for
the
purpose
of
getting
ahead
of
crewe
but
you
have
overlooked
the
fact
that
it
is
possible
to
account
in
another
way
for
all
the
clues
we
have
picked
up
suppose
sir
horace
return
from
scotland
was
due
to
a
message
from
a
lady
friend
suppose
the
lady
went
to
see
him
accompanied
by
a
friend
whom
sir
horace
did
not
like
a
friend
of
whom
sir
horace
was
jealous
suppose
they
asked
for
money
blackmail
and
there
was
a
quarrel
in
which
sir
horace
was
shot
then
we
have
your
idea
as
to
how
the
lady
handkerchief
was
torn
i
agree
with
that
in
the
main
the
lady
and
her
friend
fled
from
the
place
later
in
the
night
the
place
is
burgled
by
some
one
who
has
had
his
eye
on
it
for
some
time
and
on
entering
the
library
he
is
astounded
to
find
the
dead
body
of
the
owner
suppose
he
went
home
and
on
thinking
things
over
sent
the
letter
to
scotland
yard
with
the
idea
that
if
the
police
got
on
to
his
tracks
about
the
burglary
the
fact
that
he
had
told
us
about
the
murder
would
show
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
killing
sir
horace
that
is
a
good
theory
too
said
rolfe
in
a
meditative
tone
and
the
only
person
who
can
tell
us
which
is
the
right
one
is
sir
horace
lady
friend
the
problem
is
to
find
her
right
said
the
inspector
approvingly
and
while
you
have
been
making
inquiries
at
the
shops
about
the
handkerchief
i
have
been
down
to
the
law
courts
branch
of
the
equity
bank
where
sir
horace
kept
his
account
it
occurred
to
me
that
a
look
at
sir
horace
account
might
help
us
you
know
the
sort
of
man
he
was
you
know
his
weakness
for
the
ladies
but
he
was
careful
i
looked
through
his
private
papers
out
at
riversbrook
expecting
to
get
on
the
track
of
something
that
would
show
some
one
had
been
trying
to
blackmail
him
over
an
entanglement
with
a
woman
but
i
found
nothing
i
could
even
find
any
feminine
correspondence
if
sir
horace
was
in
the
habit
of
getting
letters
from
ladies
he
was
also
in
the
habit
of
destroying
them
no
doubt
he
adopted
that
precaution
when
his
wife
was
alive
and
found
it
such
a
wise
one
that
he
kept
it
up
when
there
was
less
need
for
it
but
a
weakness
for
the
ladies
costs
money
rolfe
as
you
know
and
that
is
why
i
had
a
look
at
his
banking
account
he
made
some
payments
that
it
would
be
worth
while
to
trace
payments
to
west
end
drapers
and
that
sort
of
thing
of
course
sir
horace
being
a
cautious
man
and
occupying
a
public
position
might
not
care
to
flaunt
his
weakness
in
the
eyes
of
west
end
shopkeepers
and
instead
of
paying
the
accounts
of
his
lady
friend
of
the
moment
may
have
given
her
the
money
and
trusted
to
her
paying
the
bills
a
thing
that
women
of
that
kind
are
never
in
a
hurry
to
do
in
that
case
the
payments
to
west
end
shopkeepers
are
for
goods
supplied
to
his
daughter
however
i
taken
a
note
of
the
names
dates
and
amounts
of
a
number
of
them
and
i
want
you
to
see
the
managers
of
these
shops
we
are
getting
close
to
it
now
said
rolfe
approvingly
i
think
so
was
the
modest
reply
of
his
superior
there
is
one
thing
about
sir
horace
account
which
struck
me
as
peculiar
every
four
weeks
for
the
past
eight
months
sir
horace
drew
a
cheque
for
and
every
cheque
of
the
kind
was
made
payable
to
number
now
unless
he
wished
to
hide
the
nature
of
the
transaction
from
his
bankers
why
not
put
in
the
cheque
in
the
name
of
the
person
who
received
the
money
it
have
been
for
his
personal
use
for
in
that
case
he
would
have
made
the
cheques
payable
to
self
besides
a
man
with
a
banking
account
draw
a
regular
every
four
weeks
for
personal
expenses
he
draws
a
cheque
just
when
he
wants
a
few
pounds
instead
of
carrying
notes
about
with
him
i
asked
the
bank
manager
about
these
cheques
and
he
looked
up
a
couple
of
them
and
found
they
had
been
cashed
over
the
counter
so
he
called
up
the
cashier
and
from
him
i
learnt
that
sir
horace
came
in
and
cashed
them
as
far
as
he
can
remember
sir
horace
cashed
all
these
cheques
i
assume
he
did
so
because
he
realised
that
there
was
less
likely
to
be
comment
in
the
bank
than
if
a
young
lady
arrived
at
the
bank
with
them
this
a
month
suggests
that
sir
horace
had
something
choice
and
not
too
expensive
stowed
away
in
a
flat
that
is
a
matter
on
which
hill
ought
to
be
able
to
throw
some
light
if
he
knows
anything
i
get
it
out
of
him
it
struck
me
as
extraordinary
that
sir
horace
should
have
taken
hill
into
his
service
knowing
what
he
was
but
this
apparently
is
the
explanation
he
knew
that
hill
would
gossip
about
him
for
fear
of
being
exposed
for
that
would
mean
that
hill
would
lose
his
situation
and
would
find
it
impossible
to
get
another
one
without
a
reference
from
him
we
have
hill
brought
here
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
boy
in
buttons
entered
and
handed
inspector
chippenfield
a
card
seldon
from
hampstead
he
explained
to
rolfe
do
go
away
yet
it
may
be
something
about
this
case
seldon
entered
the
office
and
held
the
door
ajar
for
a
man
behind
him
he
shook
hands
with
inspector
chippenfield
and
rolfe
and
then
motioned
his
companion
to
a
chair
this
is
robert
evans
the
landlord
of
the
flowerdew
hotel
covent
garden
he
explained
he
looked
at
evans
with
the
air
of
a
inspector
waiting
for
a
witness
to
corroborate
his
statement
but
as
that
gentleman
remained
silent
he
sharply
asked
is
that
so
quite
right
said
evans
in
a
moist
husky
voice
he
was
a
short
fat
man
with
an
extremely
red
face
and
bulging
eyes
which
watered
very
much
and
apparently
required
to
be
constantly
mopped
with
a
handkerchief
which
he
carried
in
his
hand
this
peculiarity
gave
evans
the
appearance
of
a
man
perpetually
in
mourning
and
this
effect
was
heightened
by
a
species
of
incipient
palsy
which
had
seized
on
his
lower
facial
muscles
and
caused
his
lips
to
tremble
violently
he
was
bald
in
the
front
of
the
head
but
not
on
the
top
the
baldness
over
the
temples
had
joined
hands
and
left
isolated
over
the
centre
of
the
forehead
a
small
tuft
of
hair
which
with
the
playfulness
of
second
childhood
showed
a
tendency
to
curl
yes
you
quite
right
he
repeated
huskily
as
though
some
one
had
doubted
the
statement
evans
is
my
name
and
i
not
ashamed
of
it
he
came
to
me
this
morning
and
told
me
that
hill
gave
false
evidence
at
the
inquest
yesterday
inspector
seldon
explained
so
i
brought
him
along
to
see
you
false
evidence
hill
exclaimed
inspector
chippenfield
with
keen
interest
let
us
hear
about
it
well
you
will
remember
hill
said
he
was
at
home
on
the
night
of
the
murder
pursued
inspector
seldon
i
looked
up
his
depositions
before
i
came
away
and
what
he
said
was
this
took
my
daughter
to
the
zoo
in
the
afternoon
we
left
the
zoo
at
half
past
five
and
went
home
and
had
tea
my
wife
then
took
the
child
to
the
and
i
remained
at
home
i
did
not
go
out
that
night
they
returned
about
ten
and
after
supper
we
all
went
to
bed
but
evans
tells
me
he
saw
hill
in
his
bar
at
three
on
the
morning
of
the
of
august
he
has
an
early
license
for
the
accommodation
of
the
covent
garden
traffic
he
can
swear
to
hill
a
man
who
goes
to
bed
at
ten
has
no
right
to
be
wandering
about
covent
garden
at
and
besides
hill
told
us
nothing
about
this
so
i
brought
evans
along
to
see
what
you
make
of
it
inspector
chippenfield
had
taken
up
a
pencil
and
was
making
a
few
notes
very
interesting
indeed
he
said
then
he
turned
to
evans
and
asked
are
you
sure
you
saw
hill
in
your
bar
at
three
there
is
no
possibility
of
a
mistake
he
is
the
man
who
was
knocked
down
outside
by
a
porter
running
into
him
said
evans
mopping
his
eyes
i
could
bring
half
a
dozen
witnesses
who
will
swear
to
him
you
see
it
this
way
interpolated
inspector
seldon
taking
up
the
landlord
narrative
his
training
had
taught
him
to
bring
out
the
salient
points
of
a
story
and
he
was
naturally
of
the
opinion
that
he
could
tell
another
man
story
better
than
the
man
could
tell
it
himself
hill
was
staring
about
him
it
was
probably
the
first
time
he
had
been
to
covent
garden
in
the
early
morning
and
got
knocked
over
he
was
stunned
and
some
porters
took
him
in
to
the
bar
sat
him
on
a
form
and
poured
some
rum
into
him
some
of
the
porters
were
for
ringing
up
the
ambulance
others
were
for
carrying
hill
off
to
the
hospital
but
he
soon
recovered
however
he
sat
there
for
about
twenty
minutes
and
after
having
several
drinks
at
his
own
expense
he
went
away
evans
served
him
with
the
drinks
good
said
inspector
chippenfield
who
liked
the
circumstantial
details
of
the
story
and
you
can
get
half
a
dozen
porters
to
identify
him
bill
cribb
harry
winch
charlie
brown
a
fellow
they
call
violets
i
do
know
his
real
name
evans
was
calling
on
his
memory
for
further
names
but
was
stopped
by
inspector
chippenfield
that
will
do
very
well
and
how
did
you
happen
to
be
at
the
inquest
at
hampstead
that
is
a
bit
out
of
your
way
evans
mopped
his
eyes
and
inspector
seldon
took
upon
himself
to
reply
for
him
he
has
a
in
the
trade
at
hampstead
keeps
the
in
coulter
street
evans
had
to
go
out
to
see
his
on
business
and
his
took
him
along
to
the
court
out
of
curiosity
inspector
chippenfield
nodded
rolfe
he
said
take
down
evans
statement
outside
and
get
him
to
sign
it
do
go
away
when
you
finished
i
want
you
evans
even
if
he
felt
that
full
justice
had
been
done
to
his
story
by
inspector
seldon
was
disappointed
at
the
police
officer
failure
to
do
justice
to
his
manly
scruples
in
coming
forward
to
give
evidence
against
a
man
who
had
never
done
him
any
harm
addressing
inspector
chippenfield
he
said
i
do
altogether
like
mixing
myself
up
in
this
business
that
is
my
way
if
i
have
a
thing
to
say
to
a
man
i
like
to
say
it
to
his
face
i
do
like
a
man
to
say
things
behind
a
man
back
that
is
if
he
calls
himself
a
man
but
i
thought
over
this
thing
after
leaving
the
court
and
hearing
this
chap
hill
say
he
had
left
home
that
night
and
i
talked
it
over
with
my
wife
you
did
the
right
thing
said
inspector
chippenfield
with
the
emphasis
of
a
man
who
had
profited
by
the
triumph
of
right
evans
was
under
the
impression
that
the
inspector
approval
referred
chiefly
to
the
part
he
had
played
as
a
husband
in
talking
over
his
perplexity
with
his
wife
rather
than
the
part
he
had
played
as
a
man
in
revealing
that
hill
had
lied
in
his
evidence
i
always
do
he
said
my
wife
one
of
the
sensible
sort
and
when
a
man
takes
her
advice
he
do
go
far
wrong
she
advised
me
to
go
straight
to
the
and
tell
them
all
i
know
is
a
cruel
murder
she
said
who
knows
but
it
might
be
our
turn
next
this
example
of
the
imaginative
element
in
feminine
logic
made
no
impression
on
the
practical
official
who
listened
to
the
admiring
husband
that
is
all
right
said
inspector
chippenfield
soothingly
i
understand
your
scruples
they
do
you
credit
but
an
honest
man
like
you
does
want
to
shield
a
criminal
from
justice
least
of
all
a
murderer
when
rolfe
returned
to
his
superior
with
evans
signed
statement
in
his
hand
he
found
the
inspector
preparing
to
leave
the
office
put
on
your
hat
and
come
with
me
said
the
inspector
we
will
go
out
and
see
hill
i
frighten
the
truth
out
of
her
and
then
tackle
hill
he
is
sure
to
be
up
at
riversbrook
and
we
can
go
on
there
from
camden
town
while
on
the
way
to
camden
town
by
tube
inspector
chippenfield
arranged
his
plans
with
the
object
of
saving
time
he
would
interview
hill
and
while
he
was
doing
so
rolfe
could
make
inquiries
at
the
neighbouring
hotels
about
hill
it
was
the
inspector
conviction
that
a
man
who
had
anything
to
do
with
a
murder
would
require
a
steady
supply
of
stimulants
next
day
hill
kept
a
small
confectionery
shop
adjoining
a
cinema
theatre
to
supplement
her
husband
wages
by
a
little
earnings
of
her
own
in
order
to
support
her
child
although
the
shop
was
an
unpretentious
one
and
catered
mainly
for
the
of
the
juvenile
patrons
of
the
picture
house
next
door
it
was
called
the
camden
town
confectionery
emporium
and
the
title
was
printed
over
the
little
shop
in
large
letters
inspector
chippenfield
walked
into
the
empty
shop
and
rapped
sharply
on
the
counter
a
little
thin
woman
with
prematurely
grey
hair
and
a
depressed
expression
appeared
from
the
back
in
response
to
the
summons
she
started
nervously
as
her
eye
encountered
the
police
uniform
but
she
waited
to
be
spoken
to
is
your
name
hill
asked
the
inspector
sternly
emily
hill
the
woman
nodded
feebly
her
frightened
eyes
fixed
on
the
inspector
face
then
i
want
to
have
a
word
with
you
continued
the
inspector
walking
through
the
shop
into
the
parlour
come
in
here
and
answer
my
questions
hill
followed
him
timidly
into
the
room
he
had
entered
it
was
a
small
apartment
and
the
inspector
massive
proportions
made
it
look
smaller
still
he
took
up
a
commanding
position
on
the
strip
of
drugget
which
did
duty
as
a
and
staring
fiercely
at
her
suddenly
commenced
hill
where
was
your
husband
on
the
night
of
the
of
august
when
his
employer
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
murdered
hill
shrank
before
that
fierce
gaze
and
said
in
a
low
tone
please
sir
he
was
at
home
at
home
was
he
i
not
so
sure
of
that
tell
me
all
about
your
husband
movements
on
that
day
and
night
what
time
did
he
come
home
to
begin
with
he
came
home
early
in
the
afternoon
to
take
our
little
girl
to
the
zoo
which
was
a
treat
she
had
been
looking
forward
to
for
a
long
while
i
could
go
myself
there
being
the
shop
to
look
after
so
hill
and
daphne
went
to
the
zoo
and
after
they
came
home
and
had
tea
i
took
her
to
the
pictures
while
hill
minded
the
shop
it
was
not
the
next
door
but
the
big
one
in
high
street
where
they
were
showing
lynne
then
when
we
come
home
about
ten
we
all
had
supper
and
went
to
bed
and
your
husband
did
go
out
again
no
sir
when
i
got
up
in
the
morning
to
bring
him
a
cup
of
tea
he
was
still
sound
asleep
but
might
he
not
have
gone
out
in
the
night
while
you
were
asleep
no
sir
i
a
very
light
sleeper
and
i
wake
at
the
least
stir
hill
story
seemed
to
ring
true
enough
although
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
interrogator
with
a
kind
of
frightened
brightness
inspector
chippenfield
looked
at
her
in
silence
for
a
few
seconds
so
that
the
whole
truth
is
it
he
said
at
length
yes
sir
the
woman
earnestly
assured
him
you
can
ask
hill
and
he
tell
you
the
same
thing
something
reminiscent
in
inspector
chippenfield
mind
responded
to
this
sentence
he
pondered
over
it
for
a
moment
and
then
remembered
that
hill
had
applied
the
same
phrase
to
his
wife
evidently
there
had
been
collusion
a
comparing
of
tales
beforehand
the
woman
had
been
tutored
by
her
cunning
scoundrel
of
a
husband
but
undoubtedly
her
tale
was
false
the
whole
truth
said
the
inspector
again
yes
sir
answered
hill
now
look
here
said
the
police
officer
in
his
sternest
tones
as
he
shook
a
warning
finger
at
the
little
woman
i
know
you
are
lying
i
know
hill
did
sleep
in
the
house
that
night
he
was
seen
near
riversbrook
in
the
early
part
of
the
night
and
he
was
seen
wandering
about
covent
garden
after
the
murder
had
been
committed
it
is
no
use
lying
to
me
hill
if
you
want
to
save
your
husband
from
being
arrested
for
this
murder
you
tell
the
truth
what
time
did
he
leave
here
that
night
i
already
told
you
the
truth
sir
replied
the
little
woman
he
did
leave
the
place
after
he
came
back
from
the
zoo
inspector
chippenfield
was
puzzled
it
seemed
to
him
that
hill
was
a
woman
of
weak
character
and
yet
she
stuck
firmly
to
her
story
perhaps
evans
had
made
a
mistake
in
identifying
hill
as
the
man
who
had
been
carried
into
his
bar
after
being
knocked
down
nothing
was
more
common
than
mistakes
of
identification
his
glance
wandered
round
the
room
as
though
in
search
of
some
inspiration
for
his
next
question
his
eye
took
mechanical
note
of
the
trumpery
articles
of
rickety
furniture
wandered
over
the
cheap
almanac
prints
which
adorned
the
walls
but
became
riveted
in
the
cheap
overmantel
which
surmounted
the
for
in
the
slip
of
mirror
which
formed
the
centre
of
that
ornament
inspector
chippenfield
caught
sight
of
the
features
of
hill
frowning
and
shaking
her
head
at
somebody
invisible
he
turned
his
head
warily
but
she
was
too
quick
for
him
and
her
features
were
impassive
again
when
he
looked
at
her
following
the
direction
indicated
by
the
mirror
inspector
chippenfield
saw
hill
had
been
signalling
through
a
window
which
looked
into
the
back
yard
he
reached
it
in
a
step
and
threw
open
the
window
a
small
and
not
little
girl
was
just
leaving
the
yard
by
the
gate
inspector
chippenfield
called
to
her
pleasantly
and
she
retraced
her
steps
with
a
frightened
face
come
in
my
dear
i
want
you
said
the
inspector
wreathing
his
red
face
into
a
smile
i
fond
of
little
girls
the
little
girl
smiled
nodded
her
head
and
presently
appeared
in
response
to
the
inspector
invitation
he
glanced
at
hill
noticed
that
her
face
was
grey
and
drawn
with
sudden
terror
she
opened
her
mouth
as
though
to
speak
but
no
words
came
the
inspector
lifted
the
child
on
to
his
knee
she
nestled
to
him
confidingly
enough
and
looked
up
into
his
face
with
an
artless
glance
what
is
your
name
my
dear
daphne
sir
daphne
hill
how
old
are
you
daphne
please
sir
i
eight
next
birthday
why
you
quite
a
big
girl
daphne
do
you
go
to
school
oh
yes
sir
i
in
the
second
form
do
you
like
going
to
school
daphne
yes
sir
i
suppose
you
like
going
to
the
zoo
better
did
you
like
going
with
father
the
other
day
the
child
eyes
sparkled
with
retrospective
pleasure
oh
yes
she
said
delightedly
we
saw
all
kinds
of
things
lions
and
tigers
and
elephants
i
had
a
ride
on
a
elephant
her
eyes
grew
big
with
the
memory
an
took
a
bun
with
his
long
nose
out
of
my
hand
that
was
splendid
daphne
which
did
you
like
best
the
zoo
or
the
pictures
i
liked
them
both
she
replied
was
father
at
home
when
you
came
home
from
the
pictures
no
said
the
little
girl
innocently
he
was
out
hill
standing
a
little
way
off
with
fear
on
her
face
uttered
an
inarticulate
noise
and
took
a
step
towards
the
inspector
and
her
daughter
better
not
interfere
hill
unless
you
want
to
make
matters
worse
said
the
inspector
meaningly
now
tell
me
daphne
dear
when
did
your
father
come
home
not
till
morning
replied
the
little
girl
with
a
timid
glance
at
her
mother
how
do
you
know
that
because
i
slept
in
mother
bed
that
night
with
mother
like
i
always
do
when
father
is
away
but
father
came
home
in
the
morning
and
lifted
me
into
my
own
bed
because
he
said
he
wanted
to
go
to
bed
what
time
was
that
daphne
i
do
know
sir
it
was
light
daphne
you
could
see
oh
yes
sir
inspector
chippenfield
told
the
child
she
was
a
good
girl
and
gave
her
sixpence
the
little
one
slipped
off
his
knee
and
ran
across
to
her
mother
with
delight
to
show
the
coin
all
unconscious
that
she
had
betrayed
her
father
the
mother
pushed
the
child
from
her
with
a
gesture
a
heavy
step
was
heard
in
the
shop
and
the
inspector
looking
through
the
window
saw
rolfe
he
opened
the
door
leading
from
the
shop
and
beckoned
his
subordinate
in
rolfe
was
excited
and
looked
like
a
man
burdened
with
weighty
news
he
whispered
a
word
in
inspector
chippenfield
ear
let
go
into
the
shop
said
inspector
chippenfield
promptly
but
first
i
make
things
safe
here
he
locked
the
door
leading
to
the
kitchen
put
the
key
into
his
pocket
and
followed
his
colleague
into
the
shop
now
rolfe
what
is
it
i
found
out
that
hill
put
in
nearly
the
whole
day
after
the
murder
drinking
in
a
wine
tavern
he
sat
there
like
a
man
in
a
dream
and
spoke
to
nobody
the
only
thing
he
took
any
interest
in
was
the
evening
papers
he
bought
about
a
dozen
of
them
during
the
afternoon
where
was
this
asked
the
inspector
at
a
little
wine
tavern
in
high
street
where
he
never
been
seen
before
the
man
who
keeps
the
place
gave
me
a
good
description
of
him
though
hill
went
there
about
ten
in
the
morning
and
started
drinking
port
wine
and
as
fast
as
the
evening
papers
came
out
he
sent
the
boy
out
for
them
glanced
through
them
and
then
crumpled
them
up
he
stayed
there
till
after
five
by
that
time
the
editions
would
reach
camden
town
and
if
you
remember
it
was
the
editions
which
had
the
first
news
of
the
murder
the
declares
that
hill
drank
nearly
two
bottles
of
tarragona
port
in
threepenny
glasses
during
the
day
i
should
have
credited
hill
with
a
better
taste
in
port
with
his
opportunities
as
sir
horace
fewbanks
butler
said
inspector
chippenfield
drily
what
you
have
found
out
rolfe
only
goes
to
bear
out
my
own
discovery
that
hill
is
deeply
implicated
in
this
affair
i
have
found
out
for
my
part
that
hill
did
not
spend
the
night
of
the
murder
at
home
here
there
was
a
ring
of
triumph
in
inspector
chippenfield
voice
as
he
announced
this
discovery
but
before
rolfe
could
make
any
comment
upon
it
there
was
a
quick
step
behind
them
and
both
men
turned
to
see
hill
the
butler
was
astonished
at
finding
the
two
police
officers
in
his
wife
shop
he
hesitated
and
apparently
his
first
impulse
was
to
turn
into
the
street
again
but
realising
the
futility
of
such
a
course
he
came
forward
with
an
attempt
to
smooth
his
worried
face
into
a
conciliatory
smile
hill
said
inspector
chippenfield
sternly
once
and
for
all
will
you
own
up
where
you
were
on
the
night
of
the
murder
hill
started
slightly
then
with
admirable
he
recovered
himself
and
became
as
and
reticent
as
ever
i
already
told
you
sir
he
replied
smoothly
i
spent
it
in
my
own
home
if
you
ask
my
wife
sir
she
tell
you
i
never
stirred
out
of
the
house
after
i
came
back
from
taking
my
little
girl
to
the
zoo
i
know
she
will
you
scoundrel
burst
out
the
choleric
inspector
she
been
well
tutored
by
you
and
she
tells
the
tale
very
well
but
it
no
good
hill
you
forgot
to
tutor
your
little
daughter
and
innocently
put
you
away
what
more
you
were
seen
in
london
before
daybreak
the
night
after
the
murder
the
game
up
my
man
inspector
chippenfield
produced
a
pair
of
handcuffs
as
he
spoke
hill
passed
his
tongue
over
his
dry
lips
before
he
was
able
to
speak
do
put
them
on
me
he
said
imploringly
as
inspector
chippenfield
advanced
towards
him
i
i
confess
chapter
xi
inspector
chippenfield
first
words
were
a
warning
you
know
what
you
are
saying
hill
he
asked
you
know
what
this
means
any
statement
you
make
may
be
used
in
evidence
against
you
at
your
trial
i
tell
you
everything
faltered
hill
the
impassive
mask
of
the
english
servant
had
dropped
from
him
and
he
stood
revealed
as
a
trembling
elderly
man
with
furtive
eyes
and
a
painfully
shaken
manner
i
be
glad
to
tell
you
everything
he
declared
laying
a
twitching
hand
on
the
inspector
coat
i
not
had
a
minute
peace
or
rest
since
since
it
happened
the
dry
official
manner
in
which
inspector
chippenfield
produced
a
was
in
striking
contrast
to
the
trapped
man
attitude
go
ahead
he
commanded
wetting
his
pencil
between
his
lips
before
hill
could
respond
a
small
boy
entered
the
shop
a
ragged
dirty
urchin
bareheaded
and
barefooted
he
tapped
loudly
on
the
counter
with
a
halfpenny
what
do
you
want
boy
roughly
asked
the
inspector
a
of
blackboys
responded
the
child
in
the
confident
tone
of
a
regular
customer
if
you
permit
me
sir
i
serve
him
said
hill
and
he
glided
behind
the
little
counter
took
some
black
sticky
sweetmeats
from
one
of
the
glass
jars
on
the
shelf
and
gave
them
to
the
boy
who
popped
one
in
his
mouth
and
scurried
off
i
think
we
had
better
go
inside
and
hear
what
hill
has
to
say
inspector
while
hill
minds
the
shop
said
rolfe
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
hill
white
frightened
face
peering
through
the
dirty
little
glass
pane
in
the
parlour
door
inspector
chippenfield
approved
of
the
idea
we
do
want
to
spoil
your
wife
business
hill
she
likely
to
need
it
he
said
with
cruel
official
banter
come
here
hill
he
said
raising
his
voice
the
faded
little
woman
appeared
in
response
to
the
summons
bringing
the
child
with
her
she
shot
a
frightened
glance
at
her
husband
which
inspector
chippenfield
intercepted
never
mind
looking
at
your
husband
hill
he
said
roughly
you
done
your
best
for
him
and
the
only
thing
to
be
told
now
is
the
truth
now
you
and
your
daughter
can
stay
in
the
shop
we
want
your
husband
inside
hill
clasped
her
hands
quickly
oh
what
is
it
henry
she
said
tell
me
what
has
happened
what
have
they
found
out
keep
your
mouth
shut
commanded
her
husband
harshly
this
way
sir
if
you
please
inspector
chippenfield
and
rolfe
followed
him
into
the
parlour
now
hill
impatiently
said
inspector
chippenfield
the
butler
raised
his
head
wearily
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
begin
at
the
beginning
and
tell
you
everything
he
said
yes
replied
the
inspector
it
not
much
use
keeping
anything
back
now
oh
it
not
a
case
of
keeping
anything
back
replied
hill
you
too
clever
for
me
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
tell
you
everything
but
i
thought
i
might
be
able
to
cut
the
first
part
short
so
as
to
save
your
time
but
so
that
you
understand
everything
i
got
to
go
a
long
way
back
shortly
after
i
entered
sir
horace
fewbanks
service
in
fact
i
had
been
long
with
him
before
i
began
to
see
he
was
leading
a
strange
life
a
double
life
if
i
may
say
so
a
servant
in
a
house
particularly
one
in
my
position
sees
a
good
deal
he
is
not
meant
to
see
in
fact
he
could
close
his
eyes
to
it
if
he
wanted
to
as
no
doubt
you
from
your
experience
sir
know
very
well
a
confidential
servant
sees
and
hears
a
lot
of
things
sir
inspector
chippenfield
nodded
his
head
sharply
but
he
did
not
speak
i
think
sir
horace
trusted
me
too
continued
hill
humbly
more
than
he
would
have
trusted
most
servants
on
account
of
my
my
past
i
fancy
if
i
may
say
so
that
he
counted
on
my
gratitude
because
he
had
given
me
a
fresh
start
in
life
and
he
was
quite
right
at
first
hill
dropped
his
voice
and
looked
down
as
he
uttered
the
last
two
words
i
have
done
anything
for
him
but
as
i
was
saying
sir
i
had
been
long
in
his
house
before
i
found
out
that
he
had
a
a
weakness
hill
timidly
bowed
his
head
as
though
apologising
to
the
dead
judge
for
assailing
his
character
a
weakness
for
for
the
ladies
sometimes
sir
horace
went
off
for
the
without
saying
where
he
was
going
and
sometimes
he
went
out
late
at
night
and
did
return
till
after
breakfast
then
he
had
ladies
visiting
him
at
riversbrook
not
real
ladies
if
you
understand
sir
sometimes
there
was
a
small
party
of
them
and
then
they
made
a
noise
singing
songs
and
drinking
wine
but
generally
they
came
alone
towards
the
end
there
was
one
who
came
a
lot
oftener
than
the
others
i
found
out
afterwards
that
her
name
was
fanning
doris
fanning
she
was
a
very
pretty
young
woman
and
sir
horace
seemed
very
fond
of
her
i
knew
that
because
i
heard
him
talking
to
her
in
the
library
sir
horace
had
rather
a
loud
voice
and
i
could
help
overhearing
him
sometimes
when
i
took
things
to
his
rooms
one
night
it
was
before
sir
horace
left
for
scotland
a
rainy
gusty
night
this
young
woman
came
i
forgot
to
mention
that
when
sir
horace
expected
visitors
he
used
to
tell
me
to
send
the
servants
to
bed
early
he
told
me
to
do
so
this
night
saying
as
usual
understand
hill
and
i
replied
sir
horace
the
young
woman
came
about
ten
and
i
let
her
in
the
side
door
and
showed
her
up
to
the
library
on
the
first
floor
where
he
used
to
sit
and
work
and
read
half
an
hour
afterwards
i
took
up
some
refreshments
some
sandwiches
and
a
small
bottle
of
champagne
for
the
young
lady
and
then
went
back
downstairs
till
sir
horace
rang
for
me
to
let
the
lady
out
which
was
generally
about
midnight
but
this
night
i
hardly
been
downstairs
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
i
heard
a
loud
crash
followed
by
a
sort
of
scream
before
i
could
get
out
of
my
chair
to
go
upstairs
i
heard
the
study
door
open
and
sir
horace
called
out
come
here
i
went
upstairs
as
quick
as
i
could
and
the
door
of
the
study
being
wide
open
i
could
see
inside
sir
horace
and
the
young
lady
had
evidently
been
having
a
quarrel
they
were
standing
up
facing
each
other
and
the
table
at
which
they
had
been
sitting
was
knocked
over
and
the
refreshments
i
had
taken
up
had
been
scattered
all
about
the
young
woman
had
been
crying
i
could
see
that
at
a
glance
but
sir
horace
looked
dignified
and
the
perfect
gentleman
like
he
always
was
he
turned
to
me
when
he
saw
me
and
said
kindly
show
this
young
lady
out
i
bowed
and
waited
for
her
to
follow
me
which
she
did
after
giving
sir
horace
an
angry
look
i
let
her
out
the
same
way
as
i
let
her
in
and
took
her
through
the
plantation
to
the
front
gate
which
i
locked
after
her
when
i
got
inside
the
house
again
and
was
beginning
to
bolt
up
things
for
the
night
sir
horace
called
me
again
and
i
went
upstairs
he
said
in
the
same
calm
and
collected
voice
that
young
lady
calls
again
you
to
deny
her
admittance
that
is
all
hill
and
he
turned
back
into
his
room
again
i
did
see
her
again
until
the
morning
after
sir
horace
left
for
scotland
i
had
arranged
for
the
female
servants
to
go
to
sir
estate
in
the
country
during
his
absence
as
he
instructed
before
his
departure
and
they
and
i
were
very
busy
on
this
morning
getting
the
house
in
order
to
be
closed
up
putting
covers
on
the
furniture
and
locking
up
the
valuables
it
was
sir
horace
custom
to
have
this
done
when
he
was
away
every
year
instead
of
keeping
the
servants
idling
about
the
house
on
board
wages
and
the
house
was
then
left
in
my
charge
as
i
told
you
sir
and
after
the
servants
went
to
the
country
it
was
my
custom
to
live
at
home
till
sir
horace
returned
coming
over
two
or
three
times
a
week
to
look
over
the
place
and
make
sure
that
everything
was
all
right
on
this
morning
sir
after
superintending
the
servants
clearing
up
things
i
went
outside
the
house
to
have
a
final
look
round
and
to
see
that
the
locks
of
the
front
and
back
gates
were
in
good
working
order
i
was
going
to
the
back
first
sir
but
happening
to
glance
about
me
as
i
walked
round
the
house
i
saw
the
young
woman
that
sir
horace
had
ordered
me
to
show
out
of
the
house
the
night
before
he
went
to
scotland
peering
out
from
behind
one
of
the
fir
trees
of
the
plantation
in
front
of
the
house
as
soon
as
she
saw
that
i
saw
her
she
beckoned
to
me
i
would
not
have
taken
any
notice
of
her
only
i
did
want
the
women
servants
to
see
her
sir
horace
i
knew
would
not
have
liked
that
so
i
went
across
to
her
i
asked
her
what
she
wanted
and
i
told
her
it
was
no
use
her
wanting
to
see
sir
horace
for
he
had
gone
to
scotland
want
to
see
him
she
said
as
impudent
as
brass
you
i
want
to
see
field
or
hill
or
whatever
you
call
yourself
now
it
gave
me
quite
a
turn
i
assure
you
to
find
that
this
young
woman
knew
my
secret
and
i
turned
round
to
make
sure
that
none
of
the
servants
had
heard
her
she
noticed
me
and
she
laughed
all
right
hill
she
said
not
going
to
tell
on
you
i
just
brought
you
a
message
from
an
old
friend
fred
birchill
he
wants
to
see
you
at
this
address
and
with
that
she
put
a
bit
of
paper
into
my
hand
i
was
so
upset
and
excited
that
i
said
i
be
there
and
she
went
away
this
fred
birchill
was
a
man
i
met
in
prison
and
he
was
in
the
cell
next
to
me
how
he
got
on
my
tracks
i
had
no
idea
but
i
seemed
to
see
all
my
new
life
falling
to
pieces
now
he
knew
i
tried
to
run
straight
since
i
served
my
sentence
and
i
knew
sir
horace
would
stand
to
me
but
he
could
afford
to
have
any
scandal
about
it
and
i
knew
that
if
there
was
any
possibility
of
my
past
becoming
known
i
should
have
to
leave
his
employ
and
then
there
was
my
poor
wife
and
child
and
this
little
business
sir
nothing
was
known
about
my
past
here
so
i
determined
to
go
and
see
this
birchill
sir
the
address
she
had
given
me
was
in
westminster
and
as
my
time
was
practically
my
own
when
sir
horace
was
home
i
went
down
that
same
evening
and
when
i
got
up
the
flight
of
stairs
and
knocked
at
the
door
it
was
a
woman
voice
that
said
in
i
thought
i
recognised
the
voice
when
i
opened
the
door
you
can
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
saw
the
young
woman
to
be
doris
fanning
who
had
had
the
quarrel
with
sir
horace
that
night
and
had
brought
me
the
note
that
morning
birchill
was
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
room
with
his
feet
on
another
chair
smoking
a
pipe
in
no
he
says
with
an
unpleasant
smile
in
and
see
an
old
friend
put
a
chair
for
him
doris
and
leave
the
room
the
girl
did
so
and
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
behind
her
birchill
turned
round
to
me
and
burst
out
that
damned
employer
of
yours
has
served
me
a
nasty
trick
but
i
going
to
get
even
with
him
and
you
going
to
help
me
i
was
taken
back
at
his
words
but
i
wanted
to
hear
more
before
i
spoke
then
he
told
me
that
the
young
woman
i
had
seen
had
been
brutally
treated
by
sir
horace
she
had
been
living
in
a
little
flat
in
westminster
on
a
monthly
allowance
which
sir
horace
made
her
but
he
suddenly
cut
off
her
allowance
and
she
have
to
be
turned
out
in
the
street
to
starve
because
she
could
pay
her
rent
nice
thing
said
birchill
fiercely
this
loose
liver
to
carry
on
like
this
with
a
poor
innocent
girl
whose
only
fault
was
that
she
loved
him
too
well
if
i
could
show
him
up
and
pull
him
down
i
would
but
done
time
like
you
hill
he
was
the
judge
who
sentenced
me
and
if
i
tried
to
injure
him
that
way
my
word
would
carry
no
weight
but
i
put
up
a
job
on
him
that
make
him
sorry
the
longest
day
he
lives
and
you
help
me
sir
horace
is
in
scotland
hill
and
you
in
charge
of
his
place
get
rid
of
the
servants
hill
and
we
burgle
his
house
we
can
easily
do
it
between
us
at
this
stage
of
his
narrative
hill
stopped
and
looked
anxiously
at
his
audience
as
though
to
gather
some
idea
of
their
feelings
before
he
proceeded
further
but
inspector
chippenfield
with
a
fierce
stare
merely
remarked
and
you
consented
i
did
at
first
hill
retorted
earnestly
but
when
i
refused
he
threatened
me
threatened
that
he
expose
me
and
drag
me
and
my
wife
and
child
down
to
poverty
i
pleaded
with
him
but
it
was
of
no
use
and
at
last
i
had
to
consent
i
had
some
hope
that
in
doing
so
i
might
find
an
opportunity
to
warn
sir
horace
but
birchill
did
not
give
me
a
chance
he
insisted
that
the
burglary
should
take
place
without
delay
all
i
was
to
do
was
to
give
him
a
plan
of
the
house
explain
where
to
find
the
most
valuable
articles
that
had
been
left
there
and
wait
for
him
at
the
flat
while
he
committed
the
burglary
his
idea
in
making
me
wait
for
him
at
the
flat
was
to
make
sure
that
i
did
play
him
false
put
the
double
on
him
as
he
called
it
and
he
told
the
girl
not
to
let
me
out
of
her
sight
till
he
came
back
if
anything
went
wrong
i
should
have
to
pay
for
it
when
he
came
back
in
accordance
with
sir
horace
instructions
i
sent
the
servants
off
to
his
country
estate
it
had
been
arranged
that
birchill
was
to
wait
for
me
to
come
over
to
the
flat
on
the
of
august
the
night
fixed
for
the
burglary
but
about
while
i
was
at
riversbrook
i
heard
the
noise
of
wheels
outside
and
looking
out
i
saw
to
my
dismay
sir
horace
getting
out
of
a
with
a
in
his
hand
my
first
impulse
was
to
tell
him
everything
indeed
i
think
that
if
i
had
had
a
chance
i
would
have
but
he
came
in
looking
very
severe
and
without
saying
a
word
about
why
he
had
returned
from
scotland
said
very
sharply
have
the
servants
been
sent
down
to
the
country
as
i
directed
i
told
him
that
they
had
good
he
said
you
go
away
at
once
i
want
you
any
more
i
want
the
house
to
myself
horace
i
began
trembling
a
little
but
he
stopped
me
immediately
he
said
stand
there
and
he
said
it
in
such
a
tone
that
i
was
glad
to
go
there
was
something
in
his
look
that
frightened
me
that
night
i
got
across
to
birchill
place
and
found
him
and
the
girl
waiting
for
me
i
told
him
what
had
happened
and
begged
him
to
give
up
the
idea
of
the
burglary
but
he
been
drinking
heavily
and
was
in
a
nasty
mood
first
he
said
i
been
playing
him
false
and
had
warned
sir
horace
but
when
i
assured
him
that
i
had
he
insisted
on
going
to
commit
the
burglary
just
the
same
with
that
he
pulled
out
a
revolver
from
his
pocket
and
swore
with
an
oath
that
he
put
a
bullet
through
me
when
he
came
back
if
i
played
him
false
and
put
sir
horace
on
his
guard
and
that
he
put
a
bullet
in
the
old
scoundrel
meaning
sir
horace
if
he
interrupted
him
while
he
was
robbing
the
house
he
sat
there
cursing
and
drinking
till
he
fell
asleep
with
his
head
on
the
table
snoring
i
sat
there
not
daring
to
breathe
hoping
he
sleep
till
morning
but
miss
fanning
woke
him
up
about
nine
and
he
staggered
to
his
feet
to
get
out
with
his
revolver
stuck
in
his
coat
pocket
he
was
away
over
three
hours
and
the
girl
and
i
sat
there
without
saying
a
word
just
looking
at
each
other
and
waiting
for
a
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
to
chime
the
quarters
it
was
a
cuckoo
clock
and
it
had
just
chimed
twelve
when
we
heard
a
quick
step
coming
upstairs
to
the
flat
the
girl
fixed
her
big
dark
eyes
inquiringly
on
me
and
then
we
heard
a
hoarse
whisper
through
the
keyhole
telling
us
to
open
the
door
the
girl
ran
to
the
door
and
let
him
in
but
she
shrieked
at
the
sight
of
him
when
she
saw
him
in
the
light
for
he
looked
ghastly
and
there
was
a
spot
of
blood
on
his
face
and
his
hands
were
smeared
with
it
he
was
shaking
all
over
and
he
went
to
the
whisky
bottle
and
drained
the
drop
of
spirit
he
left
in
it
then
he
turned
to
us
and
said
horace
fewbanks
is
dead
murdered
i
suppose
he
read
what
he
saw
in
our
eyes
for
he
burst
out
angrily
stand
staring
at
me
like
a
pair
of
damned
fools
you
do
think
i
did
it
as
god
my
judge
i
never
did
it
he
was
dead
and
stiff
when
i
got
there
then
he
told
us
his
story
of
what
had
happened
he
said
that
when
he
got
to
riversbrook
there
was
a
light
in
the
library
and
he
got
over
the
fence
and
hid
himself
in
the
garden
then
he
noticed
that
there
was
a
light
in
the
hall
and
that
the
hall
door
was
open
he
thought
sir
horace
had
left
it
open
by
mistake
and
he
was
going
to
creep
into
the
house
and
hide
himself
there
till
after
sir
horace
went
to
bed
but
suddenly
the
light
in
the
library
went
out
and
birchill
again
hid
behind
a
tree
for
he
thought
sir
horace
was
retiring
for
the
night
then
the
light
in
the
hall
went
out
and
immediately
after
birchill
heard
the
hall
door
being
closed
then
he
heard
a
step
on
the
gravel
path
and
saw
a
woman
walking
quickly
down
the
path
to
the
gate
she
was
a
woman
and
birchill
naturally
thought
that
she
was
one
of
sir
horace
lady
friends
but
he
thought
it
odd
that
sir
horace
who
was
always
a
very
polite
gentleman
to
the
ladies
should
not
have
shown
her
off
the
premises
he
waited
in
the
garden
about
half
an
hour
and
as
everything
in
the
house
seemed
quite
still
he
made
his
way
to
a
side
window
and
forced
it
open
he
had
an
electric
torch
with
him
and
he
used
this
to
find
his
way
about
the
house
first
of
all
he
wanted
to
find
out
in
which
room
sir
horace
was
sleeping
and
he
knew
from
the
plan
he
made
me
draw
for
him
which
was
sir
horace
bedroom
so
he
went
there
and
opened
the
door
quietly
and
listened
but
he
could
not
hear
anyone
breathing
then
he
tried
some
of
the
other
rooms
and
turned
on
his
torch
but
could
see
no
one
he
thought
that
perhaps
sir
horace
had
fallen
asleep
in
a
chair
in
the
library
and
he
went
there
he
listened
at
the
door
but
could
hear
no
sound
then
he
turned
on
his
torch
and
by
its
light
he
saw
a
dreadful
sight
sir
horace
was
lying
huddled
up
near
the
desk
dead
just
dead
he
thought
because
there
were
little
bubbles
of
blood
on
his
lips
as
if
they
had
been
blown
there
when
breathing
his
last
he
did
wait
to
see
any
more
but
he
turned
and
ran
out
of
the
house
i
did
believe
his
story
though
miss
fanning
did
but
he
stuck
to
it
and
seemed
so
frightened
that
i
thought
there
might
be
something
in
it
till
he
brought
out
that
he
lost
his
revolver
somewhere
then
i
remembered
the
horrid
threats
he
used
against
sir
horace
and
i
was
convinced
that
he
had
committed
the
murder
but
of
course
i
dared
not
let
him
think
i
suspected
him
and
i
pretended
to
console
him
but
the
feeling
that
kept
running
through
my
head
was
that
both
of
us
would
be
suspected
of
the
murder
i
told
this
to
birchill
and
that
frightened
him
still
more
are
we
to
do
he
kept
saying
shall
both
be
hanged
then
after
a
while
we
recovered
ourselves
a
bit
and
began
to
look
at
it
from
a
more
point
of
view
nobody
knew
about
birchill
visit
to
the
house
except
our
two
selves
and
the
girl
and
there
was
no
reason
why
anybody
should
suspect
us
as
long
as
we
kept
that
knowledge
to
ourselves
birchill
idea
after
we
talked
this
over
was
that
i
should
go
quietly
home
to
bed
and
pay
a
visit
to
riversbrook
on
friday
as
usual
discover
sir
horace
fewbanks
body
and
then
tell
the
police
but
i
did
like
to
do
that
for
two
reasons
i
did
think
that
my
nerves
would
be
in
a
fit
state
to
tell
the
police
how
i
found
the
body
without
betraying
to
them
that
i
knew
something
about
it
and
i
could
bear
to
think
of
sir
horace
body
lying
neglected
all
alone
in
that
empty
house
till
the
following
day
though
i
kept
that
reason
to
myself
it
was
the
girl
who
hit
on
the
idea
of
sending
a
letter
to
the
police
she
said
that
it
would
be
the
best
thing
to
do
because
if
they
were
informed
and
went
to
the
house
and
discovered
the
body
it
would
be
so
difficult
for
me
to
face
them
afterwards
i
agreed
to
that
and
so
did
birchill
who
was
very
frightened
in
case
i
might
give
anything
away
and
consented
on
that
account
the
girl
showed
us
how
to
write
the
letter
too
she
said
she
often
heard
of
anonymous
letters
being
written
that
way
and
she
brought
out
three
different
pens
and
a
bottle
of
ink
and
a
writing
pad
after
we
agreed
what
to
write
she
showed
us
how
to
do
it
each
one
printing
a
letter
on
the
paper
in
turn
and
using
a
different
pen
each
time
you
took
care
to
leave
no
said
inspector
chippenfield
we
used
a
handkerchief
to
wrap
our
hands
in
said
hill
birchill
got
tired
of
passing
the
paper
from
one
to
another
and
wrote
all
his
letters
leaving
spaces
for
the
girl
and
me
to
write
in
ours
when
the
letter
was
written
we
wrote
the
address
on
the
envelope
the
same
way
and
stamped
it
then
i
went
out
and
posted
the
letter
in
a
at
covent
garden
suggested
inspector
chippenfield
yes
at
covent
garden
said
hill
when
i
got
home
my
wife
was
awake
and
in
a
terrible
fright
she
wanted
to
know
where
i
been
but
i
did
tell
her
i
told
her
though
that
my
very
life
depended
on
nobody
knowing
i
been
out
of
my
own
home
that
night
and
i
made
her
swear
that
no
matter
who
questioned
her
she
stick
to
the
story
that
i
been
at
home
all
night
and
in
bed
she
begged
me
to
tell
her
why
and
as
i
knew
that
she
have
to
be
told
the
next
day
i
told
her
that
sir
horace
fewbanks
had
been
murdered
she
buried
her
face
in
her
pillow
with
a
moan
but
when
i
took
an
oath
that
i
had
had
no
hand
in
it
she
recovered
and
promised
not
to
tell
a
living
soul
that
i
had
been
out
of
the
house
and
i
knew
i
could
depend
on
her
next
morning
as
soon
as
i
got
up
i
hurried
off
to
a
little
wine
tavern
and
asked
to
see
the
morning
papers
it
was
a
foolish
thing
to
do
because
i
might
have
known
that
nothing
could
have
been
discovered
in
time
to
get
into
the
morning
papers
for
i
had
posted
the
letter
until
nearly
four
but
i
was
all
nervous
and
upset
and
as
i
face
my
wife
or
settle
to
anything
until
i
knew
the
police
had
got
the
letter
and
found
the
body
i
though
a
strictly
temperate
man
in
the
ordinary
course
of
life
sir
sat
down
in
one
of
the
little
compartments
of
the
place
and
ordered
a
glass
of
wine
to
pass
the
time
till
the
first
editions
of
the
evening
papers
came
out
they
are
usually
out
here
about
noon
but
there
was
no
news
in
the
first
editions
and
so
i
stayed
there
drinking
port
wine
and
buying
the
papers
as
fast
as
they
came
out
but
it
was
not
till
the
editions
came
out
late
in
the
afternoon
that
the
papers
had
the
news
i
hurried
home
and
then
went
up
to
riversbrook
and
reported
myself
to
you
sir
as
hill
finished
his
story
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
bowed
his
head
on
the
table
in
an
attitude
of
utter
dejection
rolfe
looking
at
him
wondered
if
he
were
acting
a
part
or
if
he
had
really
told
the
truth
he
looked
at
inspector
chippenfield
to
see
how
he
regarded
the
confession
but
his
superior
officer
was
busily
writing
in
his
in
a
few
moments
however
he
put
the
down
on
the
table
and
turned
to
the
butler
sit
up
man
he
commanded
sternly
i
want
to
ask
you
some
questions
hill
raised
a
haggard
face
yes
sir
he
said
with
what
seemed
to
be
a
painful
effort
what
is
this
girl
fanning
like
rather
a
showy
piece
of
goods
if
i
may
say
so
sir
she
has
big
black
eyes
and
black
hair
and
small
regular
teeth
and
sir
horace
had
been
keeping
her
i
think
so
sir
and
a
fortnight
before
sir
horace
left
for
scotland
there
was
a
quarrel
sir
horace
cast
her
off
that
is
what
it
looked
like
to
me
said
the
butler
what
was
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
that
i
do
know
sir
did
birchill
tell
you
well
not
in
so
many
words
but
i
gathered
from
things
he
dropped
that
sir
horace
had
found
out
that
he
was
a
friend
of
miss
fanning
and
did
like
it
naturally
said
the
philosophic
police
official
is
birchill
still
at
this
flat
and
is
the
girl
still
there
the
last
i
heard
of
them
they
were
sir
of
course
they
had
been
talking
of
moving
after
sir
horace
stopped
the
allowance
well
hill
i
investigate
this
story
of
yours
said
the
inspector
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
placed
his
in
his
pocket
if
it
is
true
if
you
have
given
us
all
the
assistance
in
your
power
and
have
kept
nothing
back
i
do
my
best
for
you
of
course
you
realise
that
you
are
in
a
very
serious
position
i
do
want
to
arrest
you
unless
i
have
to
but
i
must
detain
you
while
i
investigate
what
you
have
told
us
you
will
come
up
with
us
to
the
camden
town
station
and
then
your
statement
will
be
taken
down
fully
i
give
you
three
minutes
in
which
to
explain
things
to
your
wife
chapter
xii
do
you
think
hill
story
is
true
rolfe
asked
inspector
chippenfield
as
they
left
the
camden
town
police
station
and
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
tube
station
we
soon
find
out
replied
the
inspector
of
course
there
is
something
in
it
but
there
is
no
doubt
hill
will
not
stick
at
a
lie
to
save
his
own
skin
but
we
are
more
likely
to
get
at
the
truth
by
threatening
to
arrest
him
than
by
arresting
him
if
he
were
arrested
he
would
probably
shut
up
and
say
no
more
and
are
you
going
to
arrest
birchill
yes
for
the
murder
asked
rolfe
no
for
burglary
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
charge
him
with
murder
until
we
get
more
evidence
the
papers
would
jeer
at
us
if
we
charged
him
with
murder
and
then
dropped
the
charge
do
you
think
birchill
will
squeak
on
hill
said
the
inspector
when
he
knows
that
hill
has
been
trying
to
fit
him
for
the
murder
he
try
and
do
as
much
for
hill
and
between
them
we
come
at
the
truth
we
are
on
the
right
track
at
last
my
boy
and
thank
god
we
have
beaten
our
friend
crewe
inspector
chippenfield
satisfaction
in
his
impending
triumph
over
crewe
was
increased
by
a
chance
meeting
with
the
detective
as
the
two
police
officials
came
out
of
leicester
square
station
on
their
way
to
scotland
yard
to
obtain
a
warrant
for
birchill
arrest
they
saw
crewe
in
a
crewe
also
saw
them
and
telling
the
driver
to
pull
up
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
looked
back
at
the
two
detectives
when
they
came
up
with
the
they
saw
that
crewe
had
on
a
light
overcoat
and
that
there
was
a
beside
the
driver
crewe
was
going
on
a
journey
of
some
kind
anything
fresh
about
the
riversbrook
case
he
asked
no
nothing
fresh
replied
inspector
chippenfield
looking
crewe
straight
in
the
face
you
are
a
long
time
in
making
an
arrest
said
crewe
in
a
bantering
tone
we
want
to
arrest
the
right
man
was
the
reply
there
nothing
like
getting
the
right
man
to
start
with
it
saves
such
a
lot
of
time
and
trouble
where
are
you
off
to
i
taking
a
run
down
to
scotland
the
inspector
glanced
at
crewe
rather
enviously
you
are
fortunate
in
being
able
to
enjoy
yourself
just
now
he
said
meaningly
i
wo
drop
work
altogether
remarked
crewe
i
make
a
few
inquiries
there
about
the
riversbrook
affair
yes
with
the
murderer
practically
arrested
inspector
chippenfield
permitted
himself
the
luxury
of
smiling
at
the
way
in
which
crewe
was
following
up
a
false
scent
i
thought
the
murder
was
committed
in
london
not
in
scotland
he
said
wrong
chippenfield
said
crewe
with
a
smile
sir
horace
was
murdered
in
scotland
and
his
body
was
brought
up
to
london
by
train
and
placed
in
his
own
house
in
order
to
mislead
the
police
as
the
drove
off
inspector
chippenfield
turned
to
his
subordinate
and
said
we
rub
it
into
him
when
he
comes
back
and
finds
that
we
have
got
our
man
under
lock
and
key
he
on
some
chase
scotland
he
might
as
well
go
to
siberia
while
he
about
it
with
a
warrant
in
his
pocket
inspector
chippenfield
accompanied
by
rolfe
set
out
for
macauley
mansions
westminster
they
found
the
mansions
to
be
situated
in
a
quiet
and
superior
part
of
westminster
not
far
from
victoria
station
and
consisting
of
a
large
block
of
flats
overlooking
a
square
a
patch
of
green
which
was
supposed
to
serve
as
for
the
flats
which
surrounded
it
macauley
mansions
had
no
lift
and
number
the
scene
of
the
events
of
hill
confession
was
on
the
top
floor
inspector
chippenfield
and
rolfe
mounted
the
stairs
steadily
and
finally
found
themselves
standing
on
a
neat
cocoanut
outside
the
door
of
no
the
door
was
closed
well
well
said
the
inspector
as
he
paused
panting
on
the
and
rang
the
bell
snug
quarters
these
very
snug
strange
that
these
sort
of
women
never
know
enough
to
run
straight
when
they
are
well
off
the
door
opened
and
a
young
woman
confronted
them
she
was
hardly
more
than
a
girl
pretty
and
with
large
dark
eyes
a
pathetic
drooping
mouth
and
a
wistful
expression
she
wore
a
indoor
dress
of
soft
satin
without
ornaments
and
her
luxuriant
dark
hair
was
simply
and
becomingly
coiled
at
the
back
of
her
head
she
held
a
book
in
her
left
hand
with
one
finger
between
the
leaves
as
though
the
summons
to
the
door
had
interrupted
her
reading
and
glanced
inquiringly
at
the
visitors
waiting
for
them
to
intimate
their
business
she
was
so
different
from
the
type
of
girl
they
had
expected
to
see
that
inspector
chippenfield
had
some
difficulty
in
announcing
it
are
you
miss
fanning
he
asked
yes
she
replied
then
you
are
the
young
woman
we
wish
to
see
and
with
your
permission
we
come
inside
said
inspector
chippenfield
recovering
from
his
first
surprise
and
speaking
briskly
they
followed
the
girl
into
the
hall
and
into
a
room
off
the
hall
to
which
she
led
the
way
a
small
pomeranian
dog
which
lay
on
an
easy
chair
sprang
up
barking
shrilly
at
their
entrance
but
at
the
command
of
the
girl
it
settled
down
on
its
silk
cushion
again
the
apartment
was
a
small
daintily
furnished
in
excellent
feminine
taste
both
police
officers
took
in
the
contents
of
the
room
with
the
glance
of
trained
observers
and
both
noticed
that
prominent
among
the
ornaments
on
the
mantelpiece
stood
a
photograph
of
the
late
sir
horace
fewbanks
in
a
handsome
silver
frame
the
photograph
made
it
easy
for
inspector
chippenfield
to
enter
upon
the
object
of
the
visit
of
himself
and
his
subordinate
to
the
flat
i
see
you
have
a
photograph
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
there
he
said
in
what
he
intended
to
be
an
easy
conversational
tone
waving
his
hand
towards
the
mantelpiece
the
wistful
expression
of
the
girl
face
deepened
as
she
followed
his
glance
yes
she
said
simply
it
is
so
terrible
about
him
was
he
a
a
relative
of
yours
asked
the
inspector
she
had
come
to
the
conclusion
they
were
police
officers
and
that
they
were
aware
of
the
position
she
occupied
he
was
very
kind
to
me
she
replied
when
did
you
see
him
last
how
long
before
he
before
he
died
are
you
detectives
she
asked
from
scotland
yard
replied
inspector
chippenfield
with
a
bow
why
have
you
come
here
do
you
think
that
i
that
i
know
anything
about
the
murder
not
in
the
least
the
inspector
tone
was
reassuring
we
merely
want
information
about
sir
horace
movements
prior
to
his
departure
for
scotland
when
did
you
see
him
last
i
do
remember
she
said
after
a
pause
you
must
try
said
the
inspector
in
a
tone
which
contained
a
suggestion
of
command
oh
a
few
days
before
he
went
away
a
few
days
repeated
the
inspector
and
you
parted
on
good
terms
yes
on
very
good
terms
she
met
his
glance
frankly
inspector
chippenfield
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
fixing
his
fiercest
stare
on
the
girl
he
remarked
abruptly
where
birchill
birchill
she
endeavoured
to
appear
surprised
but
her
sudden
pallor
betrayed
her
inward
anxiety
at
the
question
i
i
do
know
who
you
mean
i
mean
the
man
you
been
keeping
with
sir
horace
fewbanks
money
said
the
inspector
brutally
i
been
keeping
nobody
with
sir
horace
fewbanks
money
protested
the
girl
feebly
it
cruel
of
you
to
insult
me
that
about
do
to
go
on
with
said
inspector
chippenfield
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
rising
to
his
feet
as
he
spoke
rolfe
keep
an
eye
on
her
while
i
search
the
flat
rolfe
crossed
over
from
where
he
had
been
sitting
and
stood
beside
the
girl
she
glanced
up
at
him
wildly
with
terror
dawning
in
the
depths
of
her
dark
eyes
what
do
you
mean
how
dare
you
she
cried
in
an
effort
to
be
indignant
now
do
try
your
tragedy
airs
on
us
said
the
inspector
we
no
time
for
them
if
you
wo
tell
the
truth
you
had
better
say
nothing
at
all
he
plunged
his
hand
into
a
and
withdrew
a
pipe
this
looks
to
me
like
birchill
property
keep
that
dog
back
rolfe
the
little
dog
had
sprung
off
his
cushion
and
was
eagerly
following
the
inspector
out
of
the
room
rolfe
caught
up
the
animal
in
his
arms
and
returned
to
where
the
girl
was
sitting
her
face
was
white
and
strained
and
her
big
dark
eyes
followed
inspector
chippenfield
but
she
did
not
speak
the
inspector
tramped
noisily
into
the
little
hall
leaving
the
door
of
the
room
wide
open
rolfe
and
the
girl
saw
him
fling
open
the
door
of
another
room
a
bedroom
and
stride
into
it
he
came
out
again
shortly
and
went
down
the
hall
to
the
rear
of
the
flat
a
few
minutes
later
he
came
back
to
the
room
where
he
had
left
rolfe
and
the
girl
his
knees
were
dusty
and
some
feathers
were
adhering
to
his
jacket
as
though
he
had
been
plunging
in
odd
nooks
and
corners
and
beneath
beds
he
was
hot
flurried
and
out
of
temper
the
bird
flown
were
his
first
words
addressed
to
rolfe
hunted
high
and
low
but
i
can
not
find
a
sign
of
him
it
beats
me
how
he
managed
it
he
could
have
gone
out
the
front
way
without
my
seeing
him
go
past
the
door
and
the
back
windows
are
four
stories
high
from
the
ground
perhaps
he
was
here
when
we
came
in
suggested
rolfe
oh
yes
he
was
why
he
been
smoking
that
pipe
in
this
very
room
she
was
clever
enough
to
open
the
window
to
let
out
the
tobacco
smoke
before
she
let
us
in
but
she
did
hide
the
pipe
properly
for
i
saw
the
smoke
from
it
coming
out
of
the
and
when
i
put
my
hand
on
the
bowl
it
was
hot
feel
it
now
rolfe
placed
his
hand
on
the
pipe
which
inspector
chippenfield
had
deposited
on
the
table
the
bowl
was
still
warm
indicating
that
the
pipe
had
recently
been
alight
he
must
have
been
smoking
the
pipe
when
we
knocked
at
the
door
and
dashed
away
to
hide
before
she
let
us
in
grumbled
the
inspector
but
the
question
is
where
can
he
have
got
to
i
hunted
everywhere
and
there
no
way
out
except
by
the
front
door
so
far
as
i
can
see
go
and
have
a
look
yourself
rolfe
and
see
if
you
can
find
a
trace
of
him
watch
the
girl
rolfe
put
down
the
little
dog
he
had
been
holding
and
went
out
into
the
hall
the
dog
accompanied
him
frisking
about
him
in
friendly
fashion
rolfe
first
examined
the
bedroom
that
he
had
seen
inspector
chippenfield
enter
it
was
a
small
room
containing
a
double
bed
it
was
prettily
furnished
in
white
with
white
curtains
and
articles
in
ivory
to
match
a
glance
round
the
room
convinced
rolfe
that
it
was
impossible
for
a
man
to
secrete
himself
in
it
the
door
of
the
wardrobe
had
been
flung
open
by
the
inspector
and
the
dresses
and
other
articles
of
feminine
apparel
it
contained
flung
out
on
the
floor
there
was
no
other
possible
except
beneath
the
bed
and
the
ruthless
hand
of
the
inspector
had
torn
off
the
white
muslin
bed
hangings
revealing
emptiness
underneath
rolfe
went
out
into
the
hall
again
and
entered
the
room
next
the
bedroom
this
apartment
was
apparently
used
as
a
for
it
contained
a
large
table
a
few
chairs
a
small
sideboard
a
a
case
of
books
and
ornaments
and
two
small
oak
presses
plainly
there
was
no
place
in
it
where
a
man
could
hide
himself
the
next
room
was
the
bathroom
which
was
also
empty
opposite
the
bathroom
was
a
small
bedroom
very
barely
furnished
offering
no
possibility
of
concealment
then
the
passage
opened
into
a
large
roomy
kitchen
the
full
width
of
the
rooms
on
both
sides
of
the
hall
and
the
kitchen
completed
the
flat
rolfe
glanced
keenly
around
the
kitchen
there
were
no
cooking
appliances
visible
or
pots
or
pans
but
there
was
much
lumber
and
odds
and
ends
as
though
the
place
were
used
as
a
presumably
miss
fanning
obtained
her
meals
from
the
restaurant
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
mansions
and
had
no
use
for
a
kitchen
the
room
was
dirty
and
dusty
and
crowded
with
all
kinds
of
rubbish
but
the
miscellaneous
rubbish
stored
in
the
room
offered
no
for
a
man
rolfe
nevertheless
made
a
conscientious
search
shifting
the
lumber
about
and
ferreting
into
dark
corners
without
result
finally
he
crossed
the
room
to
look
out
of
the
window
which
had
been
left
open
no
doubt
by
inspector
chippenfield
the
mansions
in
which
the
flat
was
situated
formed
part
of
a
large
building
with
back
windows
overlooking
a
small
piece
of
ground
the
flat
was
on
the
fourth
story
rolfe
looked
around
the
neighbouring
roofs
and
down
onto
the
ground
fifty
feet
below
but
could
see
nothing
he
withdrew
his
head
and
was
turning
to
leave
the
room
when
his
attention
was
attracted
by
the
peculiar
behaviour
of
the
dog
which
had
followed
him
throughout
on
his
search
the
little
animal
after
sniffing
about
the
floor
ran
to
the
open
window
and
started
whining
and
jumping
up
at
it
rolfe
quickly
returned
to
the
window
and
looked
out
why
of
course
he
muttered
how
could
i
have
overlooked
it
inspector
he
called
aloud
come
here
inspector
chippenfield
appeared
in
the
kitchen
in
a
state
of
some
excitement
at
the
summons
he
carried
the
key
of
the
front
room
in
his
hand
having
taken
the
precaution
to
lock
miss
fanning
in
before
he
responded
to
the
call
of
his
colleague
what
is
it
rolfe
he
asked
eagerly
this
dog
has
tracked
him
to
the
window
so
he
evidently
escaped
that
way
explained
rolfe
briefly
he
climbed
along
the
inspector
chippenfield
approached
the
window
and
looked
out
a
broad
immediately
beneath
the
window
ran
the
whole
length
of
the
building
beneath
the
windows
on
the
fourth
floor
and
so
far
as
could
be
seen
continued
round
the
side
of
the
house
it
was
a
dizzy
but
not
a
difficult
feat
for
a
man
of
cool
head
to
walk
along
the
ledge
to
the
corner
of
the
house
i
wonder
where
that
infernal
ledge
goes
to
said
inspector
chippenfield
vainly
twisting
his
neck
and
protruding
his
body
through
the
window
to
a
dangerous
extent
to
see
round
the
corner
of
the
building
i
daresay
it
leads
to
the
and
the
scoundrel
knowing
that
has
been
able
to
get
round
shin
down
and
get
clear
away
i
soon
find
out
said
rolfe
i
walk
along
to
the
corner
and
see
do
you
think
you
can
do
it
rolfe
asked
the
inspector
nervously
if
you
fell
he
glanced
down
to
the
ground
far
below
with
a
shudder
nonsense
laughed
rolfe
i
wo
fall
why
the
ledge
is
a
foot
broad
and
i
got
a
steady
head
he
may
not
have
got
very
far
after
all
and
i
may
be
able
to
see
him
from
the
corner
he
got
out
of
the
window
as
he
spoke
and
started
to
walk
carefully
along
the
ledge
towards
the
corner
of
the
building
he
reached
it
safely
peered
round
screwed
himself
round
sharply
and
came
back
to
the
open
window
almost
at
a
run
you
right
he
gasped
as
he
sprang
through
i
saw
him
he
is
climbing
down
the
spouting
using
the
chimney
brickwork
as
a
brace
for
his
feet
if
we
get
downstairs
we
may
catch
him
he
was
out
of
the
kitchen
in
an
instant
up
the
passage
and
racing
down
three
steps
at
a
time
before
the
inspector
had
recovered
from
his
surprise
then
he
followed
as
quickly
as
he
could
but
rolfe
had
a
long
start
of
him
when
inspector
chippenfield
reached
the
ground
floor
rolfe
was
nowhere
in
sight
the
inspector
looked
up
and
down
the
street
wondering
what
had
become
of
him
at
that
instant
a
tall
young
man
bareheaded
and
came
running
out
of
an
pursued
by
rolfe
stop
him
cried
rolfe
to
his
superior
officer
inspector
chippenfield
stepped
quickly
out
into
the
street
in
front
of
the
fugitive
the
young
man
cannoned
into
the
burly
officer
before
he
could
stop
himself
and
the
inspector
clutched
him
fast
he
attempted
to
wrench
himself
free
but
rolfe
had
rushed
to
his
superior
assistance
and
drew
the
baton
with
which
he
had
provided
himself
when
he
set
out
from
scotland
yard
you
need
bother
about
using
that
thing
said
the
young
man
contemptuously
i
not
a
fool
i
realise
you
got
me
we
not
give
you
another
chance
inspector
chippenfield
dexterously
snapped
a
pair
of
handcuffs
on
the
young
man
wrists
what
are
these
for
said
the
captive
regarding
them
sullenly
you
know
soon
enough
when
we
get
you
upstairs
replied
the
inspector
now
then
up
you
go
they
reascended
the
stairs
in
silence
inspector
chippenfield
and
rolfe
walking
on
each
side
of
their
prisoner
holding
him
by
the
arms
in
case
he
tried
to
make
another
bolt
they
reached
the
flat
and
found
the
front
door
open
as
they
had
left
it
the
inspector
entered
the
hall
and
unlocked
the
door
the
girl
was
sitting
on
the
chair
where
they
had
left
her
with
her
head
bowed
down
in
an
attitude
of
the
deepest
dejection
she
straightened
herself
suddenly
as
they
entered
and
launched
a
terrified
glance
at
the
young
man
oh
fred
she
gasped
they
were
too
good
for
me
doris
he
responded
as
though
in
reply
to
her
unspoken
query
i
would
have
got
away
from
this
chap
he
indicated
rolfe
with
a
nod
of
his
head
but
i
ran
into
the
other
one
he
stooped
as
he
spoke
to
brush
with
his
manacled
hands
some
of
the
dirt
from
his
clothes
which
he
had
doubtless
gained
in
his
perilous
climb
down
the
side
of
the
house
and
then
straightened
himself
to
look
loweringly
at
his
captors
he
was
a
tall
slender
young
fellow
of
about
or
with
a
fresh
complexion
and
a
rather
effeminate
air
he
was
well
dressed
in
a
grey
lounge
suit
a
soft
shirt
with
a
high
double
collar
and
silk
necktie
he
looked
as
he
stood
there
more
like
a
dandified
city
clerk
than
the
desperate
criminal
suggested
by
hill
confession
come
on
what
the
charge
he
demanded
insolently
with
a
slight
glance
at
his
manacled
hands
is
your
name
frederick
birchill
asked
inspector
chippenfield
the
young
man
nodded
then
frederick
birchill
you
charged
with
burglariously
entering
the
house
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
at
hampstead
on
the
night
of
the
of
august
burglary
said
birchill
anything
else
that
will
do
for
the
present
replied
the
inspector
we
may
find
it
necessary
to
charge
you
with
a
more
serious
crime
later
well
all
i
can
say
is
that
you
got
the
wrong
man
but
that
is
nothing
new
for
you
chaps
he
added
with
a
sneer
surely
you
are
not
going
to
charge
him
with
the
murder
said
the
girl
imploringly
the
inspector
reply
was
merely
to
warn
the
prisoner
that
anything
he
said
might
be
used
in
evidence
against
him
at
his
trial
he
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
he
knows
nothing
about
it
protested
the
girl
if
you
let
him
go
i
tell
you
who
murdered
sir
horace
who
murdered
him
asked
the
inspector
hill
was
the
reply
chapter
xiii
doris
fanning
got
off
a
holborn
tram
at
king
cross
and
with
a
hasty
glance
round
her
as
if
to
make
sure
she
was
not
followed
walked
at
a
rapid
pace
across
the
street
in
the
direction
of
caledonian
road
she
walked
up
that
busy
thoroughfare
at
the
same
quick
gait
for
some
minutes
then
turned
into
a
narrow
street
and
with
another
suspicious
look
around
her
stopped
at
the
doorway
of
a
small
shop
a
short
distance
down
the
shop
sold
those
nondescript
goods
which
seem
to
afford
a
living
to
a
not
inconsiderable
class
of
london
small
shopkeepers
the
windows
and
the
shelves
were
full
of
dusty
old
books
and
magazines
trumpery
curios
and
cheap
china
furniture
and
a
collection
of
miscellaneous
odds
and
ends
a
thick
dust
lay
over
the
whole
collection
and
the
shop
and
its
contents
presented
a
deserted
and
dirty
appearance
moreover
the
door
was
closed
as
though
customers
were
not
expected
the
girl
tried
the
door
and
found
it
locked
a
fact
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
customers
were
not
even
desired
after
another
hasty
look
up
and
down
the
street
she
tapped
sharply
on
the
door
in
a
peculiar
way
the
door
was
opened
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
by
a
short
thickset
man
of
over
fifty
whose
heavy
face
displayed
none
of
the
suavity
and
desire
to
please
which
is
part
of
the
of
the
small
shopkeeper
of
london
a
look
of
annoyance
crossed
his
face
at
the
sight
of
the
girl
and
his
first
remark
to
her
was
one
which
no
shopkeeper
would
have
addressed
to
a
prospective
customer
you
he
exclaimed
what
in
god
name
has
brought
you
here
i
told
you
on
no
account
to
come
to
the
shop
how
do
you
know
somebody
followed
you
i
could
not
help
it
kincher
the
girl
responded
piteously
distracted
about
fred
and
i
had
to
come
over
to
ask
your
advice
you
women
are
all
fools
the
man
retorted
you
might
have
known
that
i
would
read
all
about
the
case
in
the
papers
and
that
i
let
you
hear
from
me
yes
kincher
she
replied
humbly
but
they
let
me
see
fred
for
a
few
minutes
yesterday
at
the
police
court
and
he
told
me
to
come
over
and
see
you
oh
if
you
only
knew
what
i
suffered
since
he
was
arrested
yesterday
he
was
committed
for
trial
i
have
closed
my
eyes
for
over
a
week
so
you
attended
the
proceedings
said
kemp
and
when
the
girl
nodded
her
head
he
went
on
the
more
fool
you
i
suppose
it
would
be
too
much
to
expect
a
woman
to
keep
away
even
though
she
knew
she
could
do
no
good
i
knew
that
kincher
but
i
simply
had
to
go
i
should
have
died
if
i
had
stayed
in
that
dreadful
flat
alone
i
tried
to
but
i
could
i
got
so
nervous
that
i
had
to
put
my
handkerchief
into
my
mouth
to
prevent
myself
from
screaming
aloud
well
since
you
are
here
you
had
better
come
inside
instead
of
standing
there
and
giving
yourself
and
me
away
to
every
passing
policeman
he
led
the
way
inside
and
the
girl
followed
him
to
a
dirty
cheerless
room
behind
the
shop
which
was
furnished
with
a
a
table
and
a
chair
it
was
evident
that
kemp
lived
alone
and
attended
to
his
own
wants
the
remains
of
an
unappetising
meal
were
on
a
corner
of
the
table
and
a
kettle
and
a
teapot
stood
by
the
fireplace
in
which
a
fire
had
recently
been
made
with
a
few
sticks
for
the
purpose
of
boiling
a
kettle
bedclothes
were
heaped
on
the
in
a
disordered
state
and
in
the
midst
of
them
nestled
a
large
cat
sit
down
said
kemp
there
was
an
old
chair
near
the
fireplace
and
he
pushed
it
towards
her
with
his
foot
what
brought
you
over
here
the
girl
sank
into
the
chair
and
began
to
cry
i
ca
help
it
kincher
she
said
i
do
know
what
to
say
or
do
fancy
fred
being
charged
with
murder
oh
it
too
dreadful
to
think
about
and
yet
i
can
think
of
nothing
else
crying
your
eyes
out
wo
help
matters
much
replied
the
unsympathetic
kemp
the
girl
did
not
reply
but
rocked
herself
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
chair
she
sobbed
so
violently
that
she
appeared
to
be
threatened
with
an
attack
of
hysteria
kemp
watched
her
silently
the
cat
on
the
as
if
awakened
by
the
noise
got
up
yawned
looked
inquiringly
round
and
then
with
a
measured
leap
sprang
into
the
lap
she
was
startled
by
his
act
and
then
she
smiled
through
her
sobs
as
she
stroked
the
animal
coat
poor
old
peter
she
exclaimed
he
wants
to
console
me
do
you
peter
i
say
kincher
i
wish
you
give
me
peter
you
do
want
him
oh
look
at
the
dear
the
cat
had
perched
himself
on
one
of
her
knees
to
beg
and
he
sawed
the
air
appealingly
with
his
forepaws
i
must
give
him
a
for
that
she
eyed
the
remains
of
the
meal
on
the
table
disdainfully
no
peter
there
is
nothing
fit
for
you
to
eat
positively
nothing
why
he
understands
me
like
a
human
being
she
continued
in
amazement
as
the
huge
cat
dropped
on
all
fours
and
deliberately
sprang
back
to
the
i
say
kincher
you
really
want
a
woman
in
this
place
to
look
after
you
it
in
a
most
shocking
state
it
like
a
pigsty
kemp
made
no
reply
but
continued
to
watch
her
her
tears
had
vanished
and
she
sat
forward
with
her
dark
eyes
sparkling
one
hand
supporting
her
pretty
face
as
she
glanced
round
the
room
have
you
a
cigarette
she
asked
suddenly
kemp
went
into
the
shop
and
came
back
with
a
packet
of
cheap
cigarettes
the
girl
pushed
them
away
petulantly
i
do
like
that
brand
she
said
have
you
anything
better
the
man
shook
his
head
no
then
here
goes
i
must
have
a
smoke
of
some
sort
she
stuck
one
of
the
cheap
cigarettes
daintily
into
her
mouth
a
match
kincher
why
the
box
is
filthy
you
must
have
a
woman
in
to
look
after
you
even
if
i
have
to
find
you
one
myself
i
do
want
any
woman
in
the
place
retorted
kemp
there
is
no
peace
for
a
man
when
a
woman
is
about
but
let
us
have
no
more
of
this
idle
chatter
what
brought
you
over
here
i
suppose
it
about
fred
poor
fred
the
girl
looked
downcast
for
a
moment
then
she
tossed
her
head
puffed
out
some
smoke
and
exclaimed
energetically
but
he
not
guilty
kincher
and
we
get
him
off
wo
we
not
merely
by
saying
so
replied
kemp
but
you
better
tell
me
how
it
came
about
that
he
was
arrested
for
the
murder
the
police
gave
away
nothing
at
the
police
court
bill
dobbs
was
down
there
and
he
told
me
they
let
out
nothing
except
that
their
principal
witness
against
fred
is
that
fellow
hill
i
always
knew
he
squeak
i
told
fred
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
job
the
girl
eyes
flashed
viciously
she
tossed
the
cigarette
into
the
and
straightened
herself
that
the
low
dirty
scoundrel
who
committed
the
murder
she
exclaimed
he
ought
to
be
in
the
dock
not
fred
was
fred
up
there
that
night
asked
kemp
up
where
at
riversbrook
or
whatever
they
call
it
yes
he
told
me
he
did
go
it
because
he
was
up
there
that
the
police
have
arrested
him
said
the
girl
hill
gave
him
away
oh
he
a
villain
is
hill
and
so
quiet
and
respectable
looking
with
it
all
he
used
to
let
me
in
when
i
went
to
riversbrook
and
let
me
out
again
and
pocket
the
i
gave
him
and
i
like
a
fool
never
suspected
him
once
or
thought
that
he
knew
anything
about
fred
coming
to
the
flat
he
let
it
out
till
the
night
sir
horace
quarrelled
with
me
sir
horace
found
out
about
about
fred
and
when
i
went
up
to
see
him
as
usual
he
told
me
that
he
had
finished
with
me
and
he
called
hill
up
to
show
me
out
this
young
lady
out
he
said
in
that
cold
haughty
voice
of
his
and
the
wily
old
villain
hill
just
bowed
and
held
the
door
open
he
followed
me
down
stairs
and
let
me
out
at
the
side
door
there
he
said
escort
you
to
the
front
gate
if
you
will
permit
me
miss
i
usually
lock
the
gate
about
this
time
i
thought
nothing
of
this
because
he
had
come
with
me
to
the
front
gate
before
he
followed
me
down
the
garden
path
through
the
plantation
till
we
reached
the
front
gate
he
opened
the
gate
for
me
and
i
said
night
hill
but
instead
of
his
replying
night
miss
fanning
as
he
usually
did
he
hissed
out
like
a
serpent
tell
birchill
i
want
to
see
him
and
i
come
to
the
flat
about
tell
him
an
old
friend
named
field
wants
to
see
him
forget
the
name
field
then
he
locked
the
gate
and
was
gone
before
i
could
speak
a
word
i
gave
fred
his
message
next
morning
i
wish
to
god
that
i
had
she
continued
i
asked
fred
not
to
keep
the
appointment
but
he
insisted
on
doing
so
he
said
that
he
and
field
had
been
good
friends
in
the
gaol
and
that
field
had
told
him
that
if
he
ever
got
on
to
anything
he
would
let
him
know
he
seemed
quite
pleased
at
the
idea
of
meeting
field
again
i
told
him
to
beware
that
field
was
laying
a
trap
for
him
but
he
would
listen
to
me
sure
enough
field
or
hill
as
he
calls
himself
now
did
come
over
that
evening
and
i
let
him
in
myself
i
took
him
into
the
where
fred
was
and
i
sat
down
in
a
corner
of
the
room
pretending
to
read
a
book
so
that
i
could
hear
what
our
visitor
had
to
say
but
the
cunning
old
devil
whispered
something
to
fred
and
fred
came
over
to
me
and
asked
if
i
mind
leaving
them
alone
for
half
an
hour
i
did
mind
so
much
because
i
knew
i
could
get
it
all
out
of
fred
after
hill
had
gone
he
remained
shut
up
with
fred
for
nearly
two
hours
and
then
i
heard
fred
letting
him
out
of
the
front
door
fred
came
in
to
me
and
i
soon
got
the
strength
of
it
all
from
him
what
do
you
think
hill
had
come
for
to
get
fred
to
burgle
sir
horace
house
and
fred
had
agreed
to
do
it
i
cried
and
i
stormed
and
went
into
hysterics
but
he
would
budge
you
know
how
obstinate
he
can
be
when
he
likes
he
said
that
hill
had
told
him
there
was
a
good
haul
to
be
picked
up
sir
horace
was
going
to
scotland
for
the
shooting
and
the
servants
were
to
be
sent
to
his
country
house
so
the
coast
would
be
clear
hill
was
to
leave
everything
right
at
riversbrook
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
august
and
he
was
to
come
across
to
the
flat
and
let
fred
know
hill
came
as
he
promised
but
as
soon
as
he
came
in
i
could
see
that
something
had
happened
the
first
words
he
said
were
that
sir
horace
had
returned
unexpectedly
from
scotland
i
was
glad
to
hear
it
for
i
thought
that
meant
that
there
would
be
no
burglary
i
said
as
much
to
fred
and
he
would
have
agreed
with
me
but
that
devil
hill
was
too
full
of
cunning
course
if
you
frightened
we
better
call
it
off
he
said
fred
had
been
drinking
during
the
day
and
you
know
what
he
like
when
he
had
a
little
too
much
was
never
frightened
of
any
job
yet
he
said
i
do
this
job
if
the
house
was
full
of
rozzers
hill
pretended
that
he
was
particular
whether
the
thing
came
off
or
not
that
night
but
all
the
while
he
kept
egging
fred
on
to
do
it
oh
i
can
see
now
what
his
game
was
in
spite
of
all
i
could
do
or
say
it
was
arranged
that
fred
should
go
over
and
see
if
it
was
quite
safe
to
carry
out
the
job
hill
said
he
thought
sir
horace
was
going
out
that
night
and
would
be
home
until
the
early
morning
about
fred
went
off
leaving
hill
and
me
alone
in
the
flat
together
how
i
wish
now
that
i
had
killed
him
when
i
had
such
a
good
chance
we
sat
there
scarcely
speaking
and
heard
the
clock
strike
the
hours
after
midnight
i
began
to
get
restless
for
i
thought
something
must
have
happened
to
fred
hill
said
in
a
low
voice
time
fred
was
back
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
when
i
heard
fred
step
outside
and
i
ran
to
let
him
in
he
came
in
as
white
as
a
sheet
i
cried
as
soon
as
i
saw
him
some
blood
on
your
face
he
did
answer
a
word
until
he
had
taken
a
big
drink
of
whisky
out
of
the
decanter
then
he
said
in
a
whisper
horace
fewbanks
has
been
murdered
cried
hill
leaping
up
from
his
chair
he
can
act
well
i
can
tell
you
god
fred
you
do
mean
it
dead
i
tell
you
replied
fred
fiercely
i
thought
and
at
the
time
i
suppose
hill
thought
that
fred
had
shot
him
either
accidentally
or
in
order
to
escape
capture
he
seemed
to
guess
what
we
were
thinking
for
he
swore
that
he
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
sir
horace
was
dead
on
the
floor
when
he
got
there
he
told
us
all
that
had
happened
when
he
got
to
riversbrook
he
found
lights
burning
on
the
ground
floor
he
jumped
over
the
fence
at
the
side
and
hid
in
the
garden
he
was
there
only
a
few
minutes
when
he
saw
the
lights
go
out
then
the
front
door
was
slammed
and
a
woman
walked
down
the
garden
path
to
the
gate
a
woman
exclaimed
kemp
yes
a
woman
why
not
she
had
been
to
see
sir
horace
one
of
his
society
mistresses
i
bet
it
was
on
her
account
that
he
came
back
from
scotland
what
time
was
this
he
asked
with
interest
about
ten
replied
the
girl
and
this
woman
this
lady
turned
out
the
lights
and
closed
the
front
door
so
fred
says
of
course
he
thought
sir
horace
had
done
it
but
he
found
out
later
that
sir
horace
was
dead
i
ca
understand
it
said
kemp
what
was
she
doing
there
if
she
found
the
man
dead
why
did
she
inform
the
police
no
wait
a
minute
she
be
afraid
to
do
that
if
she
was
a
society
woman
it
might
be
her
who
killed
him
said
the
girl
does
fred
think
that
asked
kemp
looking
at
her
closely
fred
does
know
what
to
think
she
replied
but
it
must
have
been
this
woman
or
hill
who
killed
him
i
feel
sure
myself
that
it
was
hill
this
woman
puzzles
me
said
kemp
thoughtfully
she
must
have
been
a
cool
hand
if
she
went
round
turning
out
the
lights
after
finding
his
dead
body
about
ten
you
said
that
is
as
near
as
fred
can
make
it
go
on
with
your
story
he
said
i
interested
in
this
you
were
saying
that
fred
saw
the
lights
go
out
and
then
this
woman
came
out
of
the
house
and
walked
away
well
fred
got
into
the
house
through
one
of
the
windows
at
the
side
the
one
hill
had
told
him
to
try
continued
the
girl
but
first
of
all
he
waited
about
half
an
hour
in
the
garden
so
as
to
give
sir
horace
time
to
go
to
sleep
he
was
able
to
find
his
way
about
the
house
as
hill
had
given
him
a
plan
he
felt
his
way
upstairs
and
finding
a
door
open
he
went
into
the
room
and
flashed
his
electric
torch
by
its
light
he
saw
sir
horace
fewbanks
lying
huddled
up
in
a
corner
with
a
big
pool
of
blood
beside
him
on
the
floor
he
felt
him
to
see
if
he
was
dead
the
body
was
quite
warm
but
it
was
limp
sir
horace
was
dead
fred
says
he
lost
his
nerve
and
ran
for
it
as
hard
as
he
could
he
rushed
down
stairs
and
out
of
the
house
and
got
back
to
the
flat
as
fast
as
he
could
the
three
of
us
sat
there
shaking
with
fear
and
wondering
what
to
do
hill
was
the
first
to
recover
himself
in
his
cunning
plausible
way
he
pointed
out
that
it
was
altogether
unlikely
that
suspicion
would
fall
on
fred
or
him
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
keep
quiet
and
say
nothing
then
we
have
no
awkward
questions
put
to
us
it
was
his
suggestion
that
we
should
send
an
anonymous
letter
to
scotland
yard
telling
them
sir
horace
had
been
murdered
that
would
be
much
better
he
said
than
leaving
the
body
there
until
he
went
over
and
found
it
when
he
had
to
go
over
to
riversbrook
to
take
a
look
round
in
accordance
with
the
instructions
that
had
been
given
him
when
sir
horace
went
to
scotland
knowing
what
he
did
he
was
afraid
that
if
he
was
allowed
to
discover
the
body
and
inform
the
police
he
would
let
something
slip
when
the
police
came
at
him
with
their
hundreds
of
questions
we
printed
the
letter
to
scotland
yard
each
one
doing
a
letter
at
a
time
hill
took
it
with
him
saying
he
would
post
it
on
his
way
home
when
he
left
fred
and
i
sat
there
thinking
suddenly
it
came
to
me
as
clear
as
daylight
that
hill
had
committed
the
murder
and
had
fixed
up
things
so
as
to
throw
suspicion
on
fred
he
must
have
known
sir
horace
was
coming
back
from
scotland
that
night
and
he
had
laid
in
wait
for
him
and
shot
him
then
he
had
come
over
to
my
flat
in
order
to
persuade
fred
to
carry
out
the
burglary
and
direct
suspicion
to
fred
for
the
murder
if
the
police
worried
him
i
told
fred
what
i
thought
but
he
only
laughed
at
me
and
said
i
was
talking
nonsense
but
i
was
right
for
a
week
afterwards
the
police
came
and
arrested
fred
at
the
flat
how
did
they
get
him
asked
kemp
i
saw
them
coming
along
the
street
from
the
window
and
i
pointed
them
out
to
fred
he
tried
to
get
away
through
the
kitchen
window
along
the
ledge
and
down
the
spouting
he
almost
got
away
but
one
of
the
detectives
saw
him
before
he
reached
the
ground
and
they
dashed
down
stairs
and
got
him
in
the
street
next
day
i
saw
in
the
papers
that
hill
had
made
an
important
statement
to
the
police
and
this
had
led
to
fred
arrest
hill
is
the
murderer
kincher
the
cunning
wicked
treacherous
villain
told
the
police
about
fred
being
up
there
he
wants
to
see
fred
hang
in
order
to
save
his
own
neck
the
girl
voice
rose
to
a
shriek
and
she
sprang
to
her
feet
with
blazing
eyes
kincher
she
cried
you
got
to
help
me
put
the
rope
round
this
wretch
neck
do
you
hear
me
kemp
impassivity
was
in
marked
contrast
to
the
girl
hysterical
excitement
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
he
asked
fred
wants
you
to
get
up
an
alibi
for
him
he
sent
me
over
to
ask
you
to
arrange
it
without
delay
he
wants
you
and
two
or
three
others
to
swear
that
he
was
over
here
on
the
night
of
the
murder
that
will
be
sufficient
to
get
him
off
not
me
said
kemp
shaking
his
head
decidedly
i
wo
do
it
it
too
risky
the
police
have
too
many
things
against
me
for
my
word
to
be
any
good
as
a
witness
i
only
be
landing
myself
in
trouble
for
perjury
instead
of
helping
fred
out
of
trouble
he
ought
to
have
got
an
alibi
ready
before
he
was
arrested
i
told
him
at
the
inquest
that
he
ought
to
look
after
it
and
he
swore
he
not
been
up
there
on
the
night
of
the
murder
it
is
too
late
to
do
anything
in
the
alibi
line
now
i
do
know
anybody
i
could
get
to
come
forward
and
swear
fred
was
in
their
company
that
night
there
is
a
difference
between
fixing
up
a
tale
for
the
police
before
a
man
arrested
and
going
into
the
witness
box
and
committing
perjury
on
oath
he
spoke
in
such
an
uncompromising
tone
that
the
girl
saw
it
was
useless
to
pursue
the
matter
further
suppose
i
went
to
the
police
and
told
them
that
hill
is
the
murderer
she
suggested
kemp
shook
his
head
slowly
there
is
only
your
word
for
it
that
hill
killed
him
he
said
it
does
look
to
me
as
if
he
did
when
he
went
over
to
your
flat
and
told
fred
that
sir
horace
had
come
back
from
scotland
if
he
had
killed
him
he
would
have
let
fred
go
over
without
saying
a
word
about
it
that
was
part
of
his
cunning
said
the
girl
if
he
had
said
nothing
about
sir
horace
return
fred
would
have
suspected
him
when
he
found
the
dead
body
i
as
certain
that
hill
committed
the
murder
as
if
i
had
seen
him
do
it
with
my
own
eyes
kemp
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
though
realising
the
uselessness
of
attempting
to
combat
such
a
feminine
form
of
reasoning
did
fred
say
that
the
body
was
warm
when
he
touched
it
he
asked
she
meditated
a
moment
over
this
evidence
of
hill
innocence
well
if
hill
did
kill
him
the
woman
fred
saw
leaving
the
house
must
have
done
so
she
declared
there
is
something
in
that
said
kemp
look
here
we
got
to
get
fred
a
good
lawyer
to
defend
him
and
we
must
be
guided
by
his
advice
as
to
what
is
the
best
thing
to
do
he
knows
more
about
what
will
go
down
with
a
jury
than
you
do
i
paid
a
solicitor
to
defend
him
at
the
police
court
said
the
girl
but
the
money
i
gave
him
was
thrown
away
he
said
nothing
and
did
nothing
that
shows
he
is
a
man
who
knows
his
business
replied
kemp
the
good
of
talking
to
police
court
beaks
in
a
case
that
is
bound
to
go
to
trial
it
a
waste
of
breath
the
thing
is
to
see
that
fred
is
properly
defended
when
the
case
comes
on
at
the
old
bailey
we
want
somebody
who
can
manage
the
jury
i
should
say
holymead
is
the
man
if
you
can
get
him
i
do
know
as
he
be
likely
to
take
up
the
case
for
he
do
go
in
much
for
criminal
courts
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
he
might
you
ought
to
try
to
get
him
at
least
he
used
to
be
a
friend
of
your
friend
sir
horace
so
if
he
took
up
the
case
it
would
look
as
if
he
believed
fred
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
murder
it
would
be
bound
to
make
a
good
impression
on
the
jury
would
he
be
very
expensive
asked
the
girl
not
so
expensive
as
getting
hanged
said
kemp
grimly
you
take
my
advice
and
have
him
if
you
can
get
him
never
mind
what
he
costs
if
you
can
raise
the
money
you
got
some
money
saved
up
have
you
yes
i
nearly
sir
horace
put
in
the
savings
bank
for
me
on
my
last
birthday
and
the
furniture
at
the
flat
is
mine
i
sell
that
and
everything
i
got
for
fred
sake
that
is
the
way
to
talk
said
kemp
you
go
to
this
solicitor
you
had
at
the
police
court
and
tell
him
you
want
holymead
to
defend
fred
tell
him
he
must
brief
holymead
have
nobody
else
but
holymead
tell
him
that
holymead
was
a
friend
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
and
that
if
he
appears
for
fred
the
jury
will
never
believe
that
fred
had
anything
to
do
with
the
murder
and
i
do
think
he
had
though
he
did
lie
to
me
and
swear
he
had
been
up
there
that
night
he
added
after
a
moment
reflection
chapter
xiv
there
is
one
link
in
the
chain
missing
said
rolfe
who
was
discussing
with
inspector
chippenfield
in
the
latter
room
at
scotland
yard
the
strength
of
the
case
against
birchill
and
what
is
that
asked
his
superior
the
piece
of
woman
handkerchief
that
i
found
in
the
dead
man
hand
you
remember
we
agreed
that
it
showed
there
was
a
woman
in
the
case
well
what
do
you
call
this
girl
fanning
is
she
in
the
case
surely
you
do
want
any
better
explanation
of
the
murder
than
a
quarrel
between
her
and
sir
horace
over
this
man
birchill
yes
i
see
that
plain
enough
replied
rolfe
there
is
ample
motive
for
the
crime
but
how
that
piece
of
handkerchief
got
into
the
dead
hand
is
still
a
mystery
to
me
it
would
be
easily
explained
if
this
girl
was
present
in
the
room
or
the
house
when
the
murder
was
committed
but
she
was
hill
story
is
that
she
was
at
the
flat
with
him
when
you
have
had
as
much
experience
in
investigating
crime
as
i
have
you
wo
worry
over
little
points
that
at
first
do
seem
to
fit
in
with
what
we
know
to
be
facts
responded
the
inspector
in
a
patronising
tone
i
noticed
from
the
first
rolfe
that
you
were
inclined
to
make
too
much
of
this
handkerchief
business
but
i
said
nothing
of
course
it
was
your
own
discovery
and
i
have
found
during
my
career
that
young
detectives
are
always
inclined
to
make
too
much
of
their
own
discoveries
perhaps
i
was
myself
when
i
was
young
and
inexperienced
now
as
to
this
handkerchief
what
is
more
likely
than
that
birchill
had
it
in
his
pocket
when
he
went
out
to
riversbrook
on
that
fatal
night
he
was
living
in
the
flat
with
this
girl
fanning
what
was
more
natural
than
that
he
should
pick
up
a
handkerchief
off
the
floor
that
the
girl
had
dropped
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
with
the
intention
of
giving
it
to
her
when
she
returned
to
the
room
instead
of
doing
so
he
forgot
all
about
it
when
he
shot
sir
horace
fewbanks
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
for
a
handkerchief
to
wipe
his
forehead
or
his
hands
it
was
a
hot
night
and
i
take
it
that
a
man
who
has
killed
another
does
feel
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
while
stooping
over
his
victim
with
the
handkerchief
still
in
his
hand
the
dying
man
made
a
convulsive
movement
and
caught
hold
of
a
corner
of
the
handkerchief
which
was
torn
off
inspector
chippenfield
looked
across
at
his
subordinate
with
a
smile
of
triumphant
superiority
yes
said
rolfe
meditatively
there
is
nothing
wrong
about
that
as
far
as
i
can
see
but
i
would
like
to
know
for
certain
how
it
got
there
inspector
chippenfield
was
satisfied
with
his
subordinate
testimony
to
his
perspicacity
that
is
all
right
rolfe
he
said
in
a
tone
of
kindly
banter
but
do
make
the
mistake
of
regarding
your
idle
curiosity
as
a
virtue
after
the
trial
if
you
are
still
curious
on
the
point
i
have
no
doubt
birchill
will
tell
you
he
is
sure
to
make
a
confession
before
he
is
hanged
but
it
was
more
a
spirit
of
idle
curiosity
than
anything
else
that
brought
rolfe
to
crewe
chambers
in
holborn
an
hour
later
having
secured
the
murderer
he
felt
curious
as
to
what
crewe
feelings
were
on
his
defeat
it
was
the
first
occasion
that
he
had
been
on
a
case
which
crewe
had
been
commissioned
to
investigate
and
he
was
naturally
pleased
that
inspector
chippenfield
and
he
had
arrested
the
author
of
the
crime
while
crewe
was
all
at
sea
it
was
plain
from
the
fact
that
the
latter
had
thought
it
necessary
to
visit
scotland
that
he
had
got
on
a
false
scent
it
was
not
scotland
but
scotland
yard
that
crewe
should
have
visited
rolfe
said
to
himself
with
a
smile
crewe
in
pursuance
of
his
policy
of
keeping
on
the
best
of
terms
with
the
police
gave
rolfe
a
very
friendly
welcome
he
produced
from
a
cupboard
two
glasses
a
decanter
of
whisky
a
siphon
of
soda
and
a
box
of
cigars
rolfe
quickly
discovered
that
the
cigars
were
of
a
quality
that
seldom
came
his
way
and
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
puffed
with
steady
enjoyment
then
you
are
determined
to
hang
birchill
said
crewe
as
with
a
cigar
in
his
fingers
he
faced
his
visitor
with
a
smile
we
hang
him
right
enough
said
rolfe
he
pulled
the
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
and
looked
at
it
approvingly
though
the
talk
was
of
hanging
he
had
never
felt
more
thoroughly
at
peace
with
the
world
it
will
be
a
pity
if
you
do
said
crewe
why
because
he
the
wrong
man
it
would
take
a
lot
to
make
me
believe
that
said
rolfe
stoutly
got
a
strong
case
against
him
there
is
not
a
weak
point
in
it
i
admit
that
hill
is
a
tainted
witness
but
they
find
it
pretty
hard
to
break
down
his
story
we
tested
it
in
every
way
and
find
it
stands
then
there
are
the
bootmarks
outside
the
window
birchill
boots
fit
them
to
the
smallest
fraction
of
an
inch
the
jemmy
found
in
the
flat
fits
the
mark
made
in
the
window
at
riversbrook
and
we
got
something
more
another
witness
who
saw
him
in
tanton
gardens
about
the
time
of
the
murder
if
birchill
can
get
his
neck
out
of
the
noose
he
cleverer
than
i
take
him
for
crewe
did
not
reply
directly
to
rolfe
summary
of
the
case
i
see
that
they
briefed
holymead
for
the
defence
he
said
after
a
pause
a
waste
of
good
money
said
the
police
officer
something
appealed
to
his
sense
of
humour
for
he
broke
out
into
a
laugh
what
are
you
laughing
at
asked
crewe
i
was
wondering
how
sir
horace
feels
when
he
sees
the
money
he
gave
this
girl
fanning
being
used
to
defend
his
murderer
you
are
a
hardened
scamp
rolfe
with
a
very
perverse
sense
of
humour
said
crewe
it
was
a
cunning
move
of
them
to
get
holymead
said
rolfe
they
think
it
will
weigh
with
the
jury
because
he
was
such
a
close
friend
of
sir
horace
that
he
would
have
taken
up
the
case
unless
he
felt
that
birchill
was
innocent
but
you
and
i
know
better
than
that
crewe
a
lawyer
will
prove
that
black
is
white
if
he
is
paid
for
it
in
fact
i
understand
that
according
to
the
etiquette
of
the
bar
they
have
got
to
do
it
a
barrister
has
to
abide
by
his
brief
and
leave
his
personal
feelings
out
of
account
that
so
theoretically
he
is
an
officer
of
the
court
and
his
services
are
supposed
to
be
at
the
call
of
any
man
who
is
in
want
of
him
and
can
afford
to
pay
for
them
of
course
a
leading
barrister
such
as
holymead
often
declines
a
brief
because
he
has
so
much
to
do
but
he
is
not
supposed
to
decline
it
for
personal
reasons
his
heart
will
not
be
in
the
case
said
rolfe
philosophically
on
the
contrary
i
think
it
will
said
crewe
my
own
opinion
is
that
if
necessary
he
will
exert
his
powers
to
the
utmost
in
order
to
get
birchill
off
and
that
he
will
succeed
not
he
said
rolfe
confidently
our
case
is
too
strong
you
got
a
lot
of
circumstantial
evidence
but
a
clever
lawyer
will
pull
it
to
pieces
circumstantial
evidence
has
hung
many
a
man
and
it
will
hang
many
more
but
a
jury
will
hesitate
to
convict
on
circumstantial
evidence
when
it
can
be
shown
that
the
conduct
of
the
prisoner
is
at
variance
with
what
the
conduct
of
a
guilty
man
would
be
i
do
bet
but
i
wager
you
a
box
of
cigars
to
nothing
that
holymead
gets
birchill
off
it
a
wager
but
i
take
the
cigars
because
i
could
do
with
a
box
of
these
said
rolfe
you
might
as
well
give
them
to
me
now
mr
crewe
no
no
said
crewe
with
a
smile
put
a
couple
in
your
pocket
now
because
you
wo
win
the
box
of
course
i
understand
crewe
why
you
say
birchill
is
the
wrong
man
you
feel
a
bit
sore
because
we
have
beaten
you
i
would
feel
sore
myself
in
your
place
and
i
do
deny
that
we
got
information
that
put
us
on
birchill
track
and
therefore
it
was
easier
for
us
to
solve
the
mystery
than
it
was
for
you
i
not
a
bit
sore
said
crewe
i
can
take
a
beating
especially
when
the
men
who
beat
me
are
good
sportsmen
he
bowed
towards
rolfe
and
that
officer
blushed
as
he
recalled
how
inspector
chippenfield
and
he
had
agreed
to
withhold
information
from
crewe
and
try
to
put
him
on
a
false
scent
i
wish
you
tell
me
what
you
consider
the
weak
points
of
our
case
against
birchill
asked
rolfe
your
case
is
based
on
hill
confession
and
that
to
my
mind
is
false
in
many
details
said
crewe
take
for
instance
his
account
of
how
he
came
into
contact
with
birchill
again
this
girl
fanning
after
a
quarrel
with
sir
horace
came
over
to
riversbrook
with
a
message
for
hill
which
was
virtually
a
threat
now
does
that
seem
probable
the
girl
who
had
been
in
the
habit
of
visiting
sir
horace
goes
over
to
see
hill
no
woman
in
the
circumstances
would
do
anything
of
the
sort
she
had
too
good
an
opinion
of
herself
to
take
a
message
to
a
servant
at
a
house
from
which
she
had
been
expelled
by
the
owner
who
had
been
keeping
her
how
would
she
have
felt
if
she
had
run
into
sir
horace
it
is
true
that
sir
horace
left
for
scotland
the
day
before
but
it
is
improbable
that
the
girl
who
had
quarrelled
with
sir
horace
a
fortnight
before
knew
the
exact
date
on
which
he
intended
to
leave
and
how
did
hill
behave
when
he
got
the
message
according
to
his
story
he
consented
to
go
and
see
birchill
under
threat
of
exposure
and
he
consented
to
become
an
accomplice
in
the
burglary
for
the
same
reason
sir
horace
knew
all
about
hill
past
so
why
should
he
fear
a
threat
of
exposure
hill
explained
that
interposed
rolfe
he
pointed
out
that
though
sir
horace
knew
his
past
he
could
afford
to
have
any
scandal
about
it
quite
so
but
could
birchill
afford
to
threaten
a
man
who
was
under
the
protection
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
would
birchill
pit
himself
against
sir
horace
i
think
that
sir
horace
knowing
the
law
pretty
thoroughly
would
soon
have
found
a
way
to
deal
with
birchill
if
hill
was
threatened
by
birchill
his
first
impulse
knowing
what
a
powerful
protector
he
had
in
sir
horace
fewbanks
would
have
been
to
go
to
him
and
seek
his
protection
against
this
dangerous
old
associate
of
his
convict
days
according
to
hill
own
story
he
was
something
in
the
nature
of
a
confidential
servant
trusted
to
some
extent
with
the
secrets
of
sir
horace
double
life
what
more
likely
than
such
a
man
threatened
as
he
describes
should
turn
to
his
master
who
had
shielded
him
and
trusted
him
i
confess
that
is
a
point
which
never
struck
me
said
rolfe
thoughtfully
now
let
us
go
on
to
the
meeting
between
hill
and
birchill
continued
crewe
this
girl
fanning
discarded
by
sir
horace
because
discovered
she
was
playing
him
false
with
birchill
is
made
the
ostensible
reason
for
birchill
wishing
to
commit
a
burglary
at
riversbrook
because
birchill
wants
as
he
says
to
get
even
with
sir
horace
fewbanks
is
it
likely
that
birchill
would
confide
his
desire
for
revenge
so
frankly
to
sir
horace
confidential
servant
the
trusted
custodian
of
his
master
valuables
who
could
rely
on
his
protection
the
protection
of
a
man
of
whom
birchill
stood
admittedly
in
fear
and
whom
he
knew
according
to
hill
story
was
unassailable
from
his
slander
what
had
hill
to
fear
from
the
threats
of
a
man
like
birchill
when
he
was
living
under
sir
horace
protection
all
that
hill
had
to
do
when
birchill
tried
to
induce
him
by
threats
of
exposure
of
his
past
to
help
in
a
burglary
at
his
house
was
to
threaten
to
tell
everything
to
sir
horace
birchill
told
hill
that
he
was
frightened
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
the
judge
who
had
sentenced
him
then
birchill
confidence
in
hill
is
remarkable
any
way
you
look
at
it
he
sends
for
hill
whom
he
had
known
in
gaol
and
whom
he
had
seen
since
to
confide
in
him
that
it
is
his
intention
to
burgle
his
employer
house
he
rashly
assumes
that
hill
will
do
all
that
he
wishes
and
he
proceeds
to
lay
his
cards
on
the
table
but
even
supposing
that
birchill
was
foolish
enough
to
do
this
to
trust
a
chance
gaol
acquaintance
so
implicitly
there
is
a
far
more
puzzling
action
on
his
part
why
did
he
want
hill
assistance
to
burgle
a
practically
unprotected
house
i
confess
i
have
great
difficulty
in
understanding
why
such
an
accomplished
flash
burglar
as
birchill
one
of
the
best
men
at
the
game
in
london
at
the
present
time
should
want
the
assistance
of
an
amateur
like
hill
in
such
a
simple
job
rolfe
looked
startled
hill
says
he
wanted
a
plan
of
the
house
and
to
know
what
valuables
it
contained
crewe
smiled
and
has
it
been
your
experience
among
criminals
rolfe
that
a
burglar
must
have
a
plan
of
the
place
he
intends
to
burgle
and
that
to
get
this
plan
he
will
give
himself
away
to
any
man
who
can
supply
it
a
plan
has
its
uses
but
it
is
indispensable
only
when
a
very
difficult
job
is
being
undertaken
such
as
breaking
through
a
wall
or
a
ceiling
to
get
at
a
room
which
contains
a
safe
this
job
was
as
simple
as
a
b
and
besides
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
birchill
knew
the
girl
fanning
must
have
known
that
sir
horace
would
be
going
away
some
time
in
august
and
that
the
house
would
be
empty
did
he
want
a
plan
of
an
empty
house
he
would
be
free
to
roam
all
over
it
when
he
had
forced
a
window
he
wanted
to
know
what
valuables
were
there
said
rolfe
and
therefore
took
hill
into
his
confidence
if
hill
had
told
his
master
even
birchill
would
realise
the
risk
of
that
there
would
be
no
valuables
to
get
next
we
come
to
sir
horace
fewbanks
unexpected
return
according
to
hill
story
he
made
some
tentative
efforts
to
commence
a
confession
as
soon
as
he
saw
his
employer
but
sir
horace
was
upset
about
something
and
was
too
impatient
to
listen
to
a
word
is
such
a
story
reasonable
or
likely
hill
says
that
sir
horace
had
always
treated
him
well
and
according
to
his
earlier
statement
when
he
permitted
himself
to
be
terrorised
into
agreeing
to
this
burglary
he
told
himself
that
chance
would
throw
in
his
way
some
opportunity
of
informing
his
master
and
he
told
you
that
birchill
mistrusting
his
unwilling
accomplice
hurried
on
the
date
of
the
burglary
so
as
to
give
him
no
such
opportunity
well
chance
throws
in
hill
way
the
very
opportunity
he
has
been
seeking
but
he
is
too
frightened
to
use
it
because
sir
horace
happens
to
return
in
an
angry
or
impatient
mood
let
us
take
birchill
attitude
when
hill
tells
him
that
sir
horace
has
unexpectedly
returned
from
scotland
birchill
is
suspicious
that
hill
has
played
him
false
and
naturally
so
but
hill
instead
of
letting
him
think
so
and
thus
preventing
the
burglary
from
taking
place
does
all
he
can
to
reassure
him
while
at
the
same
time
begging
him
to
postpone
the
burglary
that
was
hardly
the
best
way
to
go
about
it
let
us
charitably
assume
that
hill
was
too
frightened
to
let
birchill
remain
under
the
impression
that
he
played
him
false
and
let
us
look
at
birchill
attitude
it
is
inconceivable
that
birchill
should
have
permitted
himself
to
be
reassured
when
right
through
the
negotiations
between
himself
and
hill
he
showed
the
most
marked
distrust
of
the
latter
yet
according
to
hill
he
suddenly
abandons
this
attitude
for
one
of
trusting
credulity
meekly
accepting
the
assurance
of
the
man
he
distrusts
that
sir
horace
fewbanks
unexpected
return
from
scotland
on
the
very
night
the
burglary
is
to
be
committed
is
not
a
trap
to
catch
him
but
a
coincidence
then
after
drinking
himself
nearly
blind
he
sets
forth
with
a
revolver
to
commit
a
burglary
on
the
house
of
the
judge
who
tried
him
on
hill
bare
word
that
everything
is
all
right
guileless
trusting
birchill
hill
is
left
locked
up
in
the
flat
with
the
girl
for
birchill
who
has
just
trusted
him
implicitly
in
a
far
more
important
matter
affecting
his
own
liberty
has
a
belated
sense
of
caution
about
trusting
his
unworthy
accomplice
while
he
is
away
committing
the
burglary
the
time
goes
on
the
couple
in
the
flat
hear
the
clock
strike
twelve
before
returning
footsteps
are
heard
he
enters
and
immediately
announces
to
hill
and
the
girl
with
every
symptom
of
strongly
marked
terror
that
while
on
his
burglarious
mission
he
has
come
across
the
dead
body
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
murdered
in
his
own
house
mark
that
he
tells
them
freely
and
openly
tells
hill
as
soon
as
he
gets
in
the
flat
allowing
for
possible
defects
in
my
previous
reasoning
against
hill
story
admitting
that
an
adroit
prosecuting
counsel
may
be
able
to
buttress
up
some
of
the
weak
points
allowing
that
you
may
have
other
circumstantial
evidence
supporting
your
case
that
is
the
fatal
flaw
in
your
chain
because
of
birchill
statement
on
his
return
to
the
flat
no
jury
in
the
world
ought
to
convict
him
i
do
see
why
said
rolfe
crewe
fixed
his
deep
eyes
intently
on
rolfe
as
he
replied
because
if
birchill
had
committed
this
murder
he
would
never
have
admitted
immediately
on
his
returning
least
of
all
to
hill
anything
about
the
dead
body
but
he
told
hill
that
he
did
commit
the
murder
protested
rolfe
but
you
say
that
he
did
commit
the
murder
retorted
the
detective
you
can
not
use
that
piece
of
evidence
both
ways
your
case
is
that
this
man
birchill
while
visiting
riversbrook
to
commit
a
burglary
which
he
and
hill
arranged
encountered
sir
horace
fewbanks
and
murdered
him
i
say
that
his
admission
to
hill
on
his
return
to
the
flat
that
he
had
come
across
the
body
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
is
proof
that
birchill
did
not
commit
the
murder
no
murderer
would
make
such
a
damning
admission
least
of
all
to
a
man
he
did
trust
to
a
man
who
he
believed
was
capable
of
entrapping
him
next
you
have
birchill
consenting
to
a
message
being
sent
to
scotland
yard
conveying
the
information
that
sir
horace
had
been
murdered
is
that
the
action
of
a
guilty
man
would
it
have
been
more
to
his
interest
to
leave
the
dead
man
body
undiscovered
in
the
empty
house
and
bolt
from
the
country
it
might
have
remained
a
week
or
more
before
being
discovered
true
he
would
have
had
to
find
some
way
of
silencing
hill
while
he
got
away
from
the
country
he
might
have
had
to
resort
to
the
crude
method
of
tying
hill
up
gagging
him
and
leaving
him
in
the
flat
but
even
that
would
have
been
better
than
to
inform
the
police
immediately
of
the
murder
and
place
his
life
at
the
mercy
of
hill
whom
he
distrusted
looked
at
your
way
i
admit
that
there
are
some
weak
points
in
our
case
said
rolfe
but
you
find
that
our
counsel
will
be
able
to
answer
most
of
them
in
his
address
to
the
jury
if
birchill
commit
the
murder
who
did
do
you
deny
that
he
went
up
to
riversbrook
that
night
the
letter
sent
to
scotland
yard
shows
that
some
one
was
there
besides
the
murderer
if
birchill
was
there
and
helped
to
write
the
letter
and
so
much
is
part
of
your
case
he
was
the
murderer
in
short
i
believe
birchill
went
up
there
to
commit
a
burglary
and
found
the
murdered
body
of
sir
horace
do
you
think
that
hill
did
it
asked
rolfe
that
is
more
than
i
like
to
say
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
been
so
obtuse
as
to
neglect
hill
somewhat
in
my
investigations
in
fact
i
did
know
until
i
got
hold
of
a
copy
of
his
statement
to
the
police
that
he
was
an
inspector
chippenfield
omitted
to
inform
me
of
the
fact
i
did
know
that
said
rolfe
without
a
blush
as
he
rose
to
go
he
ought
to
have
told
you
chapter
xv
when
rolfe
left
crewe
office
he
went
back
to
scotland
yard
he
found
inspector
chippenfield
still
in
his
office
and
related
to
him
the
substance
of
his
interview
with
crewe
the
inspector
listened
to
the
recital
in
growing
anger
birchill
not
the
right
man
he
spluttered
why
of
course
he
is
the
case
against
him
is
purely
circumstantial
but
it
as
clear
as
daylight
then
you
do
think
there
anything
in
crewe
points
asked
rolfe
i
think
so
little
of
them
that
i
look
upon
birchill
as
good
as
hanged
that
for
crewe
points
inspector
chippenfield
snapped
his
fingers
contemptuously
and
i
surprised
to
think
that
you
rolfe
whose
loyalty
to
your
superior
officer
is
a
thing
i
would
have
staked
my
life
on
should
have
sat
there
and
listened
to
such
rubbish
i
would
have
listened
to
him
for
two
minutes
no
not
for
half
a
minute
he
was
trying
to
pick
our
case
to
pieces
out
of
blind
spite
and
jealousy
because
got
ahead
of
him
in
the
biggest
murder
case
london
had
for
many
a
long
day
a
man
who
jaunts
off
to
scotland
looking
for
clues
to
a
murder
committed
in
london
is
a
fool
rolfe
that
what
i
call
him
we
have
beaten
him
beaten
him
badly
and
he
does
like
it
but
it
is
not
the
first
time
scotland
yard
has
beaten
him
and
it
wo
be
the
last
i
suppose
you
right
said
rolfe
but
there
one
point
he
made
which
rather
struck
me
i
must
say
that
about
birchill
telling
hill
found
the
dead
body
would
birchill
have
told
hill
that
if
committed
the
murder
nothing
more
likely
exclaimed
the
inspector
my
theory
is
that
birchill
while
committing
the
burglary
at
riversbrook
was
surprised
by
sir
horace
fewbanks
it
is
possible
that
the
judge
tried
to
capture
birchill
to
hand
him
over
to
the
police
and
birchill
shot
him
i
believe
that
birchill
fired
both
shots
that
he
had
two
revolvers
but
whatever
took
place
a
dangerous
criminal
like
birchill
would
not
require
much
provocation
to
silence
a
man
who
interrupted
him
while
he
was
on
business
bent
and
a
man
moreover
against
whom
he
nursed
a
bitter
grudge
in
this
case
it
is
possible
there
was
no
provocation
at
all
sir
horace
fewbanks
may
have
simply
heard
a
noise
entered
the
room
where
birchill
was
and
been
shot
down
without
mercy
birchill
heard
him
coming
and
was
ready
for
him
with
a
revolver
in
each
hand
you
got
to
bear
in
mind
that
birchill
went
to
the
house
in
a
dangerous
mood
half
mad
with
drink
and
furious
with
anger
against
sir
horace
fewbanks
for
cutting
off
the
allowance
of
the
girl
he
was
living
with
he
threatened
before
he
left
the
flat
to
commit
the
burglary
that
he
do
for
the
judge
if
he
interfered
with
him
that
according
to
hill
statement
said
rolfe
inspector
chippenfield
glanced
at
his
subordinate
in
some
surprise
of
course
it
hill
statement
he
said
is
he
our
principal
witness
and
does
his
statement
fit
in
with
all
the
facts
we
have
been
able
to
gather
well
the
murder
of
sir
horace
no
matter
how
it
was
committed
was
committed
in
cold
blood
but
immediately
birchill
had
done
it
the
fact
that
he
had
committed
a
murder
would
have
a
sobering
effect
on
him
although
he
bragged
before
he
left
the
flat
for
riversbrook
about
killing
the
judge
if
he
came
across
him
he
had
no
intention
of
jeopardising
his
neck
unnecessarily
and
after
he
had
shot
down
the
judge
in
a
moment
of
drunken
passion
he
would
be
anxious
to
keep
hill
whom
he
mistrusted
from
knowing
that
he
had
committed
the
murder
but
he
was
fully
aware
that
hill
would
be
the
person
who
discover
the
body
next
day
and
that
if
he
was
put
on
his
guard
he
would
bring
in
the
police
and
probably
give
away
everything
that
birchill
had
said
and
done
so
to
obviate
this
risk
and
prepare
hill
birchill
hit
on
the
plan
of
telling
him
that
he
found
the
judge
dead
body
while
burgling
the
place
it
was
a
bold
idea
and
not
without
its
advantages
when
you
consider
what
an
awkward
fix
birchill
was
in
not
only
did
it
keep
hill
quiet
but
it
forced
him
into
the
position
of
becoming
a
kind
of
silent
accomplice
in
the
crime
you
remember
hill
did
not
give
the
show
away
until
he
was
trapped
and
then
he
only
confessed
to
save
his
own
skin
he
a
dangerous
and
deep
scoundrel
this
birchill
but
he
swing
this
time
and
you
find
that
his
confession
of
finding
the
body
will
do
more
than
anything
else
to
hang
him
properly
put
to
the
jury
and
i
see
that
it
is
properly
put
rolfe
pondered
much
over
these
two
conflicting
points
of
view
and
inspector
chippenfield
for
the
rest
of
the
day
he
inclined
to
inspector
chippenfield
conclusions
regarding
birchill
admission
about
the
body
the
idea
that
he
had
assisted
in
arresting
the
wrong
man
and
had
helped
to
build
up
a
case
against
him
was
too
unpalatable
for
him
to
accept
it
but
he
was
forced
to
admit
that
crewe
theory
was
distinctly
a
plausible
one
though
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
give
up
the
conviction
that
birchill
was
the
murderer
he
felt
that
crewe
analysis
of
the
case
for
the
prosecution
contained
several
telling
points
which
might
be
used
with
some
effect
on
a
jury
in
the
hands
of
an
experienced
counsel
rolfe
had
no
doubt
that
holymead
would
make
the
most
of
those
points
and
he
also
knew
that
the
famous
barrister
was
at
his
best
in
attacking
circumstantial
evidence
that
night
while
walking
home
the
idea
occurred
to
rolfe
of
going
over
to
camden
town
after
supper
to
see
if
by
questioning
hill
again
he
could
throw
a
little
more
light
on
what
had
taken
place
at
doris
flat
the
night
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
murdered
hill
had
been
questioned
and
at
scotland
yard
by
inspector
chippenfield
concerning
the
events
of
that
night
and
professed
to
have
confessed
to
everything
that
had
happened
but
rolfe
thought
it
possible
he
might
be
able
to
extract
something
more
which
might
assist
in
strengthening
what
crewe
regarded
as
the
weak
points
in
the
police
case
against
birchill
rolfe
had
every
justification
for
such
a
visit
for
though
hill
had
not
been
arrested
he
had
been
ordered
by
inspector
chippenfield
to
report
himself
daily
to
the
camden
town
police
station
and
the
police
of
that
district
had
been
instructed
to
keep
a
strict
eye
on
his
movements
inspector
chippenfield
did
not
regard
his
principal
witness
in
the
forthcoming
murder
trial
as
the
sort
of
man
likely
to
bolt
but
if
he
permitted
him
for
politic
reasons
to
retain
his
liberty
he
took
every
precaution
to
ensure
that
hill
should
not
abuse
his
privilege
rolfe
lived
in
lodgings
at
king
cross
and
as
the
evening
was
fine
and
he
was
fond
of
exercise
he
decided
to
walk
across
to
hill
place
as
he
walked
along
his
thoughts
revolved
round
the
murder
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
and
the
baffling
perplexities
which
had
surrounded
its
elucidation
had
they
got
hold
of
the
right
man
the
real
murderer
in
fred
birchill
rolfe
kept
asking
himself
that
question
again
and
again
a
few
hours
ago
he
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
on
the
point
he
had
looked
upon
the
great
murder
case
as
satisfactorily
solved
and
he
had
thought
with
increasing
satisfaction
of
his
own
share
in
bringing
the
murderer
to
justice
he
had
anticipated
newspaper
praise
on
his
sharpness
judicial
commendation
a
favourable
official
entry
in
the
departmental
records
of
scotland
yard
with
perhaps
promotion
for
the
good
work
he
had
accomplished
in
this
celebrated
case
these
rosy
visions
had
been
temporarily
dissipated
by
the
conversation
he
had
had
with
crewe
that
morning
if
crewe
had
not
succeeded
in
destroying
rolfe
conviction
that
the
murderer
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
had
been
caught
he
had
pointed
out
sufficient
flaws
in
the
police
case
to
shake
rolfe
previous
assurance
of
the
legal
conviction
of
birchill
for
the
crime
the
way
in
which
crewe
had
pulled
the
police
case
to
pieces
had
shown
rolfe
that
the
conviction
of
birchill
was
by
no
means
a
foregone
conclusion
and
had
left
him
a
prey
to
doubts
and
anxiety
which
inspector
chippenfield
subsequent
depreciation
of
the
detective
views
had
not
altogether
removed
the
little
shop
kept
by
the
hills
was
empty
when
rolfe
entered
it
but
hill
appeared
from
the
inner
room
in
answer
to
his
knock
the
faded
little
woman
did
not
recognise
the
police
officer
at
first
but
when
he
spoke
she
looked
into
his
face
with
a
start
she
timidly
said
in
reply
to
his
inquiry
for
her
husband
that
he
had
just
stepped
out
down
the
street
then
you
had
better
send
your
little
girl
after
him
said
rolfe
seating
himself
on
the
one
rickety
chair
on
the
outside
of
the
counter
i
want
to
see
him
hill
seemed
at
a
loss
to
reply
for
a
moment
then
she
answered
nervously
plucking
at
her
apron
the
while
i
do
think
it
be
much
use
doing
that
sir
you
see
hill
does
always
tell
me
where
going
and
i
do
really
know
where
he
is
then
why
did
you
tell
me
that
he
had
just
stepped
out
down
the
street
asked
rolfe
sharply
because
i
thought
he
might
be
far
away
then
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
do
know
where
he
is
or
when
he
be
back
no
sir
her
prompt
and
uncompromising
reply
indicated
that
she
did
not
want
him
to
wait
for
her
husband
i
think
i
wait
said
rolfe
looking
at
her
steadily
yes
sir
daphne
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
parlour
which
led
into
the
shop
and
her
mother
waved
her
back
angrily
go
to
bed
this
instant
miss
it
long
past
your
bedtime
she
said
it
was
obvious
that
hill
retained
a
vivid
recollection
of
how
disastrous
had
been
daphne
appearance
during
inspector
first
visit
to
the
shop
perhaps
your
little
girl
knows
where
her
father
is
said
rolfe
maliciously
no
she
does
replied
hill
with
some
spirit
you
can
ask
her
if
you
like
rolfe
was
suddenly
struck
with
an
idea
and
he
decided
to
test
it
i
wo
wait
i
changed
my
mind
but
if
your
husband
comes
in
tell
him
not
to
go
to
bed
until
i
seen
him
i
be
back
yes
sir
she
replied
do
you
think
he
was
going
to
riversbrook
he
asked
the
woman
flushed
suddenly
and
then
went
pale
she
knew
as
well
as
rolfe
that
her
husband
was
strictly
forbidden
pending
the
trial
to
go
near
the
place
of
his
former
employment
and
that
the
police
had
relieved
him
of
his
keys
and
taken
possession
of
the
silent
house
and
locked
everything
up
no
sir
she
replied
with
trembling
lips
hill
has
gone
over
there
how
can
you
be
certain
if
he
did
tell
you
where
he
was
going
asked
rolfe
because
it
the
last
place
in
the
world
he
think
of
going
to
gasped
hill
such
a
thought
would
never
enter
his
head
i
do
assure
you
sir
hill
would
never
dream
of
going
over
there
sir
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
rolfe
walked
thoughtfully
up
high
street
was
it
possible
that
hill
had
gone
to
his
late
master
residence
in
defiance
of
the
orders
of
the
police
if
so
only
some
very
powerful
motive
and
probably
one
which
affected
the
crime
could
have
induced
him
to
risk
his
liberty
by
making
such
a
visit
after
he
had
been
commanded
to
keep
away
from
the
place
and
how
would
he
get
into
the
house
rolfe
had
himself
locked
up
the
house
and
had
locked
the
gates
and
the
bunch
of
keys
was
at
that
moment
hanging
up
in
inspector
chippenfield
room
in
scotland
yard
but
even
as
he
asked
that
question
rolfe
found
himself
smiling
at
himself
for
his
simplicity
nothing
could
be
easier
for
a
man
like
hill
an
to
have
obtained
a
duplicate
key
before
handing
over
possession
of
the
keys
rolfe
had
noticed
with
surprise
when
he
was
locking
up
the
house
that
the
french
windows
of
the
morning
room
were
locked
from
the
outside
by
a
small
key
as
well
as
being
bolted
from
the
inside
hill
had
explained
that
the
late
sir
horace
fewbanks
had
generally
used
this
french
window
for
gaining
access
to
his
room
after
a
nocturnal
excursion
rolfe
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
nine
he
decided
to
go
to
hampstead
and
put
his
suspicions
to
the
test
it
was
quite
possible
he
was
mistaken
but
if
on
the
other
hand
hill
was
paying
a
nocturnal
visit
to
riversbrook
and
he
had
the
luck
to
capture
him
he
might
extract
from
him
some
valuable
evidence
for
the
forthcoming
trial
that
hill
had
kept
back
and
rolfe
was
above
all
things
interested
at
that
moment
in
making
the
case
for
the
prosecution
as
strong
as
possible
rolfe
walked
to
the
camden
town
underground
station
bought
a
ticket
for
hampstead
and
took
his
seat
in
the
tube
in
that
state
of
exhilarated
excitement
which
comes
to
the
detective
when
he
feels
that
he
is
on
the
road
to
a
disclosure
the
speed
of
the
train
seemed
all
too
slow
for
the
police
officer
and
he
looked
at
his
watch
at
least
a
dozen
times
during
the
short
journey
from
camden
town
to
hampstead
when
rolfe
arrived
at
hampstead
he
set
out
at
a
rapid
walk
for
riversbrook
it
was
quite
dark
when
he
reached
tanton
gardens
he
turned
into
the
rustling
avenue
of
chestnut
trees
and
strode
swiftly
down
till
he
reached
the
deserted
house
of
the
murdered
man
the
gate
was
locked
as
he
had
left
it
but
rolfe
climbed
over
it
a
late
moon
was
already
throwing
a
refulgent
light
through
the
evening
mists
silvering
the
tops
of
the
fir
trees
in
front
of
the
house
rolfe
walked
through
the
plantation
his
footsteps
falling
noiselessly
on
the
pine
needles
which
strewed
the
path
he
quickly
reached
the
other
side
of
the
little
wood
and
the
italian
garden
lay
before
him
stretching
in
silver
glory
to
the
dark
old
house
beyond
rolfe
stood
still
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
glanced
across
the
moonlit
garden
to
the
house
it
seemed
dark
deserted
and
desolate
there
was
no
sign
of
a
light
in
any
of
the
windows
facing
the
plantation
the
moon
rising
above
the
fringe
of
trees
in
the
woodland
which
skirted
the
meadows
of
the
east
side
of
the
house
cast
a
sudden
ray
athwart
the
upper
portion
of
the
house
but
the
windows
of
the
retreating
first
story
still
remained
in
shadow
rolfe
scrutinised
these
windows
closely
there
were
three
of
them
he
knew
that
two
of
them
opened
out
from
the
bedroom
the
dead
man
used
to
occupy
and
the
third
one
belonged
to
the
library
adjoining
the
room
where
the
murder
had
been
committed
the
moonlight
gradually
stealing
over
the
house
revealed
the
windows
of
the
bedroom
closed
and
the
blinds
down
but
the
library
was
still
in
shadow
for
a
large
which
grew
in
front
of
the
house
was
directly
in
the
line
of
rolfe
vision
rolfe
remained
watching
the
house
for
some
time
but
no
sign
or
sound
of
life
could
he
detect
in
its
silent
desolation
i
must
have
been
mistaken
he
muttered
with
a
final
glance
at
the
windows
of
the
first
story
there
nobody
in
the
house
he
turned
to
go
and
had
taken
a
few
steps
through
the
pinewood
when
suddenly
he
started
and
stood
still
his
quick
ear
had
caught
a
faint
sound
a
kind
of
rattle
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
house
what
was
that
noise
which
sounded
so
strangely
familiar
to
his
ears
he
had
it
it
was
the
fall
of
a
venetian
blind
instantaneously
there
came
to
rolfe
the
remembrance
that
inspector
chippenfield
had
ordered
the
library
blind
to
be
left
up
so
that
when
the
sun
was
high
in
the
heavens
its
rays
striking
in
through
the
window
over
the
top
of
the
might
dry
up
the
stain
of
blood
on
the
floor
which
washing
had
failed
to
efface
somebody
was
in
the
library
and
had
dropped
the
blind
rolfe
hurriedly
retraced
his
steps
to
the
edge
of
the
plantation
and
raced
across
the
italian
garden
feeling
for
his
revolver
as
he
ran
some
instinct
told
him
that
he
would
find
entrance
through
the
french
windows
on
the
west
side
of
the
morning
room
and
thither
he
directed
his
steps
he
pulled
out
his
electric
torch
and
tried
the
windows
they
were
shut
and
the
first
one
was
locked
the
second
one
yielded
to
his
hand
he
pulled
it
open
and
stepped
into
the
room
making
his
way
by
the
light
of
his
torch
to
the
stairs
he
swiftly
but
silently
crept
up
them
and
turned
to
the
library
on
the
left
of
the
first
landing
the
door
was
closed
but
not
locked
and
a
faint
light
came
through
the
keyhole
rolfe
pushed
the
door
open
and
looked
into
the
room
a
man
was
leaning
over
the
dead
judge
examining
its
contents
by
the
light
of
a
candle
which
he
had
set
down
on
the
desk
he
was
so
engrossed
in
his
occupation
that
he
did
not
hear
the
door
open
what
are
you
doing
there
demanded
rolfe
sternly
his
voice
sounded
hollow
and
menacing
as
it
reverberated
through
the
room
the
man
at
the
desk
started
up
and
turned
round
it
was
hill
when
he
saw
rolfe
he
looked
as
though
he
would
fall
he
made
as
if
to
step
forward
then
he
stood
quite
still
looking
at
the
officer
with
ashen
face
hill
said
rolfe
quietly
what
does
this
mean
the
butler
had
regained
his
with
wonderful
quickness
the
mask
of
reticence
dropped
over
his
face
again
and
it
was
in
the
smooth
deferential
tones
of
a
servant
that
he
replied
nothing
sir
i
just
slipped
over
from
the
shop
to
see
if
everything
was
all
right
how
did
you
get
into
the
house
by
the
french
window
sir
i
had
a
duplicate
key
which
sir
horace
had
made
and
i
see
you
also
have
a
duplicate
key
of
the
desk
why
did
you
give
these
keys
up
with
the
others
to
inspector
chippenfield
i
forgot
about
them
at
the
time
sir
i
found
them
in
an
old
pocket
this
evening
and
i
was
so
uneasy
about
the
house
shut
up
with
a
lot
of
valuable
things
in
it
and
nobody
to
give
an
eye
to
them
that
i
just
slipped
across
to
see
everything
was
all
right
you
came
here
after
dark
and
let
yourself
in
with
a
private
key
after
you
had
been
strictly
ordered
not
to
come
near
the
place
you
have
the
audacity
to
admit
you
have
done
this
well
it
this
way
sir
i
was
a
trusted
servant
of
sir
horace
i
knew
a
great
deal
about
his
private
life
if
i
may
say
so
i
know
he
kept
a
lot
of
private
papers
in
this
room
and
i
wanted
to
make
sure
they
were
safe
i
did
like
them
being
in
this
empty
house
sir
i
could
sleep
in
my
bed
of
nights
for
thinking
of
them
sir
i
felt
last
night
as
if
my
poor
dead
master
was
standing
at
my
bedside
urging
me
to
go
over
i
am
very
sorry
i
disobeyed
the
police
orders
rolfe
but
i
acted
for
the
best
hill
you
are
lying
you
are
keeping
something
back
unless
you
immediately
tell
me
the
real
reason
of
your
visit
to
this
house
tonight
i
will
take
you
down
to
the
hampstead
police
station
and
have
you
locked
up
this
visit
of
yours
will
take
a
lot
of
explaining
away
after
your
previous
confession
hill
it
enough
to
put
you
in
the
dock
with
birchill
hill
eyes
which
had
been
fixed
on
rolfe
face
wavered
towards
the
doorway
as
though
he
were
meditating
a
rush
for
freedom
but
he
merely
remarked
i
told
you
the
truth
sir
though
perhaps
not
all
of
it
i
came
across
to
see
if
i
could
find
some
of
sir
horace
private
papers
which
are
missing
how
do
you
know
there
are
any
papers
missing
as
i
said
before
rolfe
sir
horace
trusted
me
and
he
did
take
the
trouble
to
hide
things
from
me
you
mean
that
he
often
left
his
desk
open
with
important
papers
scattered
about
it
yes
sir
and
you
made
a
practice
of
going
through
them
i
did
make
a
practice
of
it
protested
hill
but
sometimes
i
glanced
at
one
or
two
of
them
i
thought
there
was
no
harm
in
it
knowing
that
sir
horace
trusted
me
and
some
papers
that
you
knew
were
there
are
now
missing
do
you
mean
stolen
yes
sir
when
did
you
see
them
last
just
before
inspector
chippenfield
came
the
morning
after
the
body
was
discovered
you
remember
sir
that
he
came
straight
up
here
while
you
stayed
downstairs
talking
to
constable
flack
do
you
mean
to
suggest
that
inspector
chippenfield
stole
them
oh
no
sir
i
do
think
he
saw
them
sir
horace
kept
them
in
this
little
place
at
the
back
of
the
desk
look
at
it
sir
it
a
sort
of
secret
drawer
rolfe
went
over
to
the
desk
and
hill
explained
to
him
how
the
hiding
place
could
be
closed
and
opened
it
was
at
the
back
of
the
desk
under
the
pigeonholes
and
the
fact
that
the
pigeonholes
came
close
down
to
the
desk
hid
the
secret
drawer
and
the
spring
which
controlled
it
what
was
the
nature
of
these
papers
asked
rolfe
well
sir
i
never
read
them
sir
horace
set
such
store
by
them
that
i
never
dared
to
open
them
for
fear
he
would
find
out
they
were
mostly
letters
and
they
were
tied
up
with
a
piece
of
silk
ribbon
a
lady
letters
of
course
said
rolfe
judging
from
the
writing
on
the
envelopes
they
were
sent
by
a
lady
said
hill
rolfe
breathed
quickly
for
he
felt
that
he
was
on
the
verge
of
a
discovery
here
was
evidence
of
a
lady
in
the
case
which
might
lead
to
a
startling
development
perhaps
crewe
was
right
in
declaring
that
birchill
was
the
wrong
man
he
said
to
himself
perhaps
the
murderer
was
not
a
man
but
a
woman
and
who
do
you
think
stole
them
he
asked
hill
that
is
more
than
i
would
like
to
say
replied
the
butler
are
you
sure
they
were
in
this
hiding
place
when
inspector
chippenfield
took
charge
of
everything
yes
sir
i
dusted
out
the
room
the
morning
you
and
he
came
to
riversbrook
together
and
the
papers
were
there
then
because
i
happened
to
touch
the
spring
as
i
was
dusting
the
desk
and
it
flew
open
and
i
saw
the
bundle
there
why
did
you
tell
inspector
chippenfield
about
the
papers
and
the
secret
drawer
that
is
what
i
intended
to
do
sir
if
he
did
find
them
himself
but
when
i
had
found
they
had
gone
i
did
like
to
say
anything
to
him
because
as
you
may
say
i
had
no
right
to
know
anything
about
them
when
did
they
go
when
did
you
find
they
were
missing
when
inspector
chippenfield
went
out
for
his
lunch
i
looked
in
the
desk
and
found
they
had
gone
who
could
have
taken
them
who
had
access
to
the
room
well
sir
chippenfield
had
some
visitors
that
morning
yes
there
were
about
a
dozen
newspaper
reporters
during
the
day
at
various
times
there
were
slingsby
and
his
assistant
who
came
out
to
make
the
inspector
seldon
who
came
to
arrange
about
the
inquest
and
there
was
that
man
from
the
undertakers
who
came
to
inquire
about
the
funeral
arrangements
but
none
of
these
men
were
likely
to
take
the
papers
and
still
less
to
know
where
they
were
hidden
in
any
case
no
visitor
could
get
at
the
desk
while
chippenfield
was
in
the
room
and
he
is
too
careful
to
have
left
any
visitor
alone
in
this
room
it
was
here
that
the
murder
was
committed
he
left
one
of
his
visitors
alone
here
for
a
few
minutes
said
hill
in
a
voice
which
was
little
more
than
a
whisper
which
one
asked
rolfe
eagerly
a
lady
who
was
she
mrs
holymead
oh
rolfe
exclamation
was
one
of
disappointment
she
is
a
friend
of
the
family
she
came
out
to
see
miss
fewbanks
it
was
a
visit
of
condolence
yes
sir
said
the
obsequious
butler
she
was
a
friend
of
the
family
as
you
say
she
was
a
friend
of
sir
horace
i
have
heard
that
sir
horace
paid
her
considerable
attention
before
she
married
holymead
it
was
a
toss
up
which
of
them
she
married
so
i
been
told
rolfe
saw
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
dismissing
the
idea
of
holymead
having
anything
to
do
with
the
missing
papers
do
you
think
that
she
stole
these
letters
these
papers
he
asked
do
you
think
she
knew
where
they
were
while
she
was
in
the
room
inspector
chippenfield
came
rushing
downstairs
for
a
glass
of
water
he
said
she
had
fainted
whew
rolfe
gave
a
low
prolonged
whistle
and
after
she
left
you
took
the
first
opportunity
of
looking
to
see
if
the
papers
were
still
there
and
you
found
they
were
gone
yes
sir
what
made
you
suspect
holymead
would
take
them
well
sir
i
did
suspect
her
at
the
time
i
just
looked
to
see
if
inspector
chippenfield
had
found
them
i
saw
they
had
gone
and
as
i
could
see
any
sign
of
them
about
anywhere
else
i
concluded
they
must
have
been
taken
without
inspector
chippenfield
knowing
anything
about
it
the
reason
i
came
over
here
was
to
have
another
careful
look
round
for
them
rolfe
was
silent
for
a
moment
what
would
you
have
done
with
the
papers
if
you
had
found
them
he
asked
suddenly
i
would
have
handed
them
over
to
the
police
sir
said
the
butler
who
obviously
had
been
prepared
for
a
question
of
the
kind
and
what
explanation
would
you
have
given
for
having
found
them
for
having
come
over
here
in
defiance
of
your
orders
from
inspector
chippenfield
the
true
explanation
sir
said
the
butler
with
a
mild
note
of
protest
in
his
voice
i
would
have
told
inspector
chippenfield
what
i
have
already
told
you
and
it
is
the
simple
truth
rolfe
was
plainly
taken
back
at
this
rebuke
but
he
did
not
reply
to
it
in
your
statement
of
what
took
place
when
birchill
returned
to
the
flat
after
committing
the
murder
he
said
something
about
having
seen
a
woman
leave
the
house
by
the
front
door
as
he
was
hiding
in
the
garden
a
fashionably
dressed
woman
i
think
he
said
yes
sir
that
was
it
do
you
believe
that
part
of
his
story
was
true
well
sir
with
a
man
like
birchill
it
is
impossible
to
say
when
he
is
telling
the
truth
and
when
he
is
there
was
no
lady
with
sir
horace
when
you
left
him
that
night
when
he
returned
from
scotland
no
sir
i
think
you
said
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
you
out
of
the
house
and
told
you
not
to
come
back
that
is
what
i
thought
at
the
time
sir
well
hill
said
rolfe
resuming
his
severe
official
tone
all
this
does
not
excuse
in
any
way
your
conduct
in
coming
over
here
and
forcing
your
way
into
the
house
in
defiance
of
the
police
opening
this
desk
and
prying
about
for
private
papers
that
do
concern
you
the
proper
course
for
you
to
adopt
was
to
come
to
scotland
yard
and
tell
your
story
about
these
missing
papers
to
inspector
chippenfield
or
myself
however
i
do
propose
to
take
any
action
against
you
at
present
only
there
is
to
be
no
more
of
it
if
you
come
hanging
about
here
again
on
your
own
account
you
find
yourself
in
the
dock
beside
birchill
hand
me
over
the
duplicate
key
of
the
door
by
which
you
came
in
and
also
the
key
of
the
desk
which
you
had
still
less
right
to
have
in
your
possession
say
nothing
to
anyone
about
those
papers
until
i
give
you
permission
to
do
so
chapter
xvi
the
day
fixed
for
the
trial
of
frederick
birchill
was
wet
dismal
and
dreary
the
rain
pelted
intermittently
through
a
hazy
chilly
atmosphere
filling
the
gutters
and
splashing
heavily
on
the
slippery
pavements
but
in
spite
of
the
rain
a
long
queue
principally
of
women
assembled
outside
the
portals
of
the
old
bailey
long
before
the
time
fixed
for
the
opening
of
the
court
at
the
private
entrance
to
the
courthouse
arrived
ladies
accompanied
by
men
they
had
received
cards
of
admission
and
had
seats
reserved
for
them
in
the
body
of
the
court
many
of
them
had
personally
known
the
late
sir
horace
fewbanks
and
their
interest
in
the
trial
of
the
man
accused
of
his
murder
was
intensified
by
the
rumours
afloat
that
there
were
to
be
some
spicy
revelations
concerning
the
dead
judge
private
life
the
arrival
of
justice
hodson
who
was
to
preside
at
the
trial
caused
a
stir
among
some
of
the
spectators
many
of
whom
belonged
to
the
criminal
class
sir
henry
hodson
had
presided
at
so
many
murder
trials
that
he
was
known
among
them
as
the
hanging
judge
among
the
spectators
were
some
whom
sir
henry
had
put
into
mourning
at
one
time
or
another
there
were
others
whom
he
had
deprived
of
their
for
specified
periods
these
spectators
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
fear
and
hatred
holymead
drove
up
in
a
a
few
minutes
later
and
his
arrival
created
an
impression
akin
to
admiration
in
the
eyes
of
the
criminal
class
he
was
an
heroic
figure
who
had
assumed
the
responsibility
of
saving
the
life
of
one
of
their
fraternity
the
eminent
counsel
success
in
the
few
criminal
cases
in
which
he
had
consented
to
appear
had
gained
him
the
respectful
esteem
of
those
who
considered
themselves
oppressed
by
the
law
and
the
spectators
on
the
pavement
might
have
raised
a
cheer
for
him
if
their
exuberance
had
not
been
restrained
by
the
proximity
of
the
policeman
guarding
the
entrance
when
the
court
was
opened
inspector
chippenfield
took
a
seat
in
the
body
of
the
court
behind
the
barrister
bench
he
ranged
his
eye
over
the
spectators
in
the
gallery
and
shook
his
head
with
manifest
disapproval
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
worst
criminals
in
london
had
managed
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
the
sergeant
outside
in
order
to
see
the
trial
of
their
notorious
colleague
fred
birchill
he
pointed
out
their
presence
to
rolfe
who
was
seated
alongside
him
there
that
scoundrel
bob
rogers
who
slipped
through
our
hands
over
the
ealing
case
and
his
pal
breaker
jim
who
just
done
seven
years
looking
down
and
grinning
at
us
he
angrily
whispered
i
give
them
something
to
grin
about
before
they
much
older
you
think
breaker
would
have
had
enough
of
the
old
bailey
to
last
him
a
lifetime
and
look
at
that
row
alongside
of
them
there
morris
hart
harry
the
hooker
and
that
chap
willis
who
murdered
the
pawnbroker
in
commercial
road
last
year
only
we
could
never
sheet
it
home
to
him
and
two
rows
behind
them
is
old
charlie
the
covent
garden
with
holder
jack
and
kemp
birchill
mate
why
they
everywhere
the
inquest
was
nothing
to
this
rolfe
kemp
must
be
thanking
his
lucky
stars
he
was
in
that
riversbrook
job
with
fred
birchill
said
rolfe
for
they
usually
work
together
and
there
crewe
up
in
the
gallery
where
exclaimed
inspector
chippenfield
with
an
indignant
start
up
there
behind
that
pillar
there
no
the
next
one
see
he
looking
down
at
you
crewe
caught
the
inspector
eye
and
nodded
and
smiled
in
a
friendly
fashion
but
inspector
chippenfield
returned
the
salutation
with
a
haughty
glare
the
impudence
of
that
chap
is
beyond
belief
he
said
to
his
subordinate
one
would
have
thought
he
have
kept
away
from
court
after
his
chase
to
scotland
and
piling
up
expenses
but
not
him
brazen
impudence
is
the
of
the
private
detective
if
scotland
yard
had
a
little
more
of
the
impudence
of
the
private
detective
rolfe
we
should
be
better
appreciated
i
suppose
he
come
in
the
hopes
of
seeing
the
jury
acquit
birchill
said
rolfe
no
doubt
replied
inspector
chippenfield
but
he
come
to
the
wrong
shop
a
good
jury
should
convict
without
leaving
the
box
if
the
case
is
properly
put
before
them
by
the
prosecution
crewe
would
like
to
triumph
over
us
but
it
is
our
turn
to
win
but
inspector
chippenfield
was
wrong
in
thinking
that
crewe
presence
in
court
was
due
to
a
desire
for
the
humiliation
of
his
rivals
crewe
had
spent
most
of
the
previous
night
reading
and
revising
his
summaries
and
notes
of
the
riversbrook
case
and
in
minutely
reviewing
his
investigations
of
it
over
several
pipes
in
the
early
morning
hours
he
pondered
long
and
deeply
on
the
secret
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
murder
without
finding
a
solution
which
satisfactorily
accounted
for
all
the
strange
features
of
the
case
but
one
thing
he
felt
sure
of
was
that
birchill
had
not
committed
the
murder
he
based
that
belief
partly
on
the
butler
confession
and
partly
on
his
own
discoveries
he
believed
hill
to
be
a
cunning
scoundrel
who
had
overreached
the
police
for
some
purpose
of
his
own
by
accusing
birchill
and
who
to
make
his
story
more
probable
had
even
implicated
himself
in
the
supposed
burglary
as
a
terrorised
accomplice
and
crewe
had
been
unable
to
test
the
story
or
find
out
what
game
he
was
playing
because
of
the
assiduity
with
which
the
principal
witness
for
the
prosecution
had
been
nursed
by
the
police
from
the
moment
he
made
his
confession
crewe
bit
hard
into
his
amber
mouthpiece
in
vexation
as
he
recalled
the
tactics
of
inspector
chippenfield
who
having
accepted
hill
story
as
genuine
had
officially
baulked
all
his
efforts
to
see
the
man
and
question
him
about
it
he
had
come
to
court
with
the
object
of
witnessing
birchill
behaviour
in
the
dock
and
the
efforts
of
any
of
his
criminal
friends
to
communicate
with
him
as
a
man
who
had
had
considerable
experience
in
criminal
trials
he
knew
the
irresistible
desire
of
the
criminal
in
the
gallery
of
the
court
to
encourage
the
man
in
the
dock
to
keep
up
his
courage
communications
of
the
kind
had
to
be
made
by
signs
it
was
impression
that
by
watching
birchill
in
the
dock
and
birchill
friends
in
the
gallery
he
might
pick
up
a
valuable
hint
or
two
it
was
also
his
intention
to
study
closely
the
defence
which
counsel
for
the
prisoner
intended
to
put
forward
it
was
therefore
with
a
feeling
of
mingled
annoyance
and
surprise
that
crewe
looking
down
from
his
point
of
vantage
at
the
bevy
of
ladies
in
the
body
of
the
court
recognised
holymead
mademoiselle
chiron
and
miss
fewbanks
seated
side
by
side
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
before
he
could
withdraw
from
their
view
behind
the
pillar
in
front
of
him
miss
fewbanks
looked
up
and
saw
him
she
bowed
to
him
in
friendly
recognition
and
crewe
saw
her
whisper
to
holymead
who
glanced
quickly
in
his
direction
and
then
as
quickly
averted
her
gaze
but
in
that
fleeting
glance
of
her
beautiful
dark
eyes
crewe
detected
an
expression
of
fear
as
though
she
dreaded
his
presence
and
he
noticed
that
she
shivered
slightly
as
she
turned
to
resume
her
conversation
with
miss
fewbanks
his
honour
justice
hodson
entered
and
the
persons
in
the
court
scrambled
hurriedly
to
their
feet
to
pay
their
tribute
of
respect
to
british
law
as
exemplified
in
the
person
of
a
stout
old
gentleman
wearing
a
scarlet
gown
and
black
sash
and
attended
by
four
of
the
sheriffs
of
london
in
their
robes
the
judge
bowed
in
response
and
took
his
seat
the
spectators
resumed
theirs
craning
their
necks
eagerly
to
look
at
the
accused
man
birchill
who
was
brought
into
the
dock
by
two
warders
the
work
of
empanelling
a
jury
commenced
and
when
it
was
completed
walters
opened
the
case
for
the
prosecution
walters
was
a
counsel
who
had
detested
the
late
justice
fewbanks
because
of
the
latter
habit
of
interrupting
the
addresses
of
counsel
with
the
object
of
inducing
them
to
curtail
their
remarks
this
practice
was
not
only
annoying
to
counsel
who
necessarily
knew
better
than
the
judge
what
the
jury
ought
to
be
told
but
it
also
tended
to
hold
counsel
up
to
ridicule
in
the
eyes
of
ignorant
jurymen
as
a
man
who
could
not
do
his
work
properly
without
the
watchful
correction
of
the
judge
but
walters
whose
legal
training
had
imbued
in
him
a
respect
for
latin
tags
subscribed
to
the
adage
mortuis
nil
nisi
therefore
he
began
his
address
to
the
jury
with
a
glowing
reference
to
the
loss
he
might
almost
say
the
irreparable
loss
which
the
judiciary
had
sustained
he
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
the
loss
which
the
nation
had
sustained
by
the
death
the
violent
death
in
short
the
murder
of
an
eminent
judge
of
the
high
court
bench
whose
clear
and
vigorous
intellect
whose
marvellous
mastery
of
the
legal
principles
laid
down
by
the
judicial
giants
of
the
past
whose
inexhaustible
knowledge
drawn
from
the
storehouses
of
british
law
whose
virile
interpretations
of
the
principles
of
british
justice
whose
unfailing
courtesy
and
consideration
to
counsel
the
memory
of
which
would
long
be
cherished
by
those
who
had
had
the
privilege
of
pleading
before
him
had
made
him
an
acquisition
and
an
ornament
to
a
bench
which
in
the
eyes
of
the
nation
had
always
represented
and
at
no
time
more
than
the
present
at
this
point
walters
bowed
to
the
presiding
judge
the
embodiment
of
legal
knowledge
legal
experience
and
legal
wisdom
after
this
tribute
to
the
murdered
man
and
the
presiding
judge
walters
proceeded
to
lay
the
facts
of
the
crime
before
the
jury
who
had
read
all
about
them
in
the
newspapers
with
methodical
care
he
built
up
the
case
against
the
accused
man
classifying
the
points
of
evidence
against
him
in
categorical
order
for
the
benefit
of
the
jury
the
most
important
witness
for
the
prosecution
was
a
man
known
as
james
hill
who
had
been
in
sir
horace
employ
as
a
butler
hill
connection
with
the
prisoner
was
in
some
aspects
unfortunate
for
himself
and
no
doubt
counsel
for
the
defense
would
endeavour
to
discredit
his
evidence
on
that
account
but
the
jury
when
they
heard
the
butler
tell
his
story
in
the
witness
box
would
have
little
difficulty
in
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
the
man
hill
was
the
victim
of
circumstances
and
his
own
weakness
of
temperament
however
much
they
might
be
disposed
to
blame
him
for
the
course
he
had
pursued
he
was
innocent
of
all
complicity
in
his
master
death
and
had
done
his
best
to
help
the
ends
of
justice
by
coming
forward
with
a
voluntary
confession
to
the
police
walters
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
or
extenuate
the
black
page
in
hill
past
but
he
asked
the
jury
to
believe
that
hill
had
bitterly
repented
of
his
former
crime
and
would
have
continued
to
lead
an
honest
life
as
sir
horace
fewbanks
butler
if
ill
fate
had
not
forged
a
cruel
chain
of
circumstances
to
link
him
to
his
past
life
and
drag
him
down
by
bringing
him
in
contact
with
the
accused
man
birchill
whom
he
had
met
in
prison
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
the
guardian
of
a
young
woman
named
doris
fanning
the
daughter
of
a
former
employee
on
his
country
estate
who
had
died
leaving
her
penniless
sir
horace
had
deemed
it
his
duty
to
bring
up
the
girl
and
give
her
a
start
in
life
after
educating
her
in
a
style
suitable
to
her
station
he
sent
her
to
london
and
paid
for
music
lessons
for
her
in
order
to
fit
her
for
a
musical
career
for
which
she
showed
some
aptitude
unfortunately
the
young
woman
had
a
and
unbalanced
temperament
and
she
gave
her
benefactor
much
trouble
sir
horace
bore
patiently
with
her
until
she
made
the
chance
acquaintance
of
birchill
and
became
instantly
fascinated
by
him
the
acquaintance
speedily
drifted
into
intimacy
and
the
girl
became
the
pliant
tool
of
birchill
who
acquired
an
almost
magnetic
influence
over
her
as
the
intimacy
progressed
she
seemed
to
have
become
a
willing
partner
in
his
criminal
schemes
when
sir
horace
fewbanks
heard
that
the
girl
had
drifted
into
an
association
with
a
criminal
like
birchill
he
endeavoured
to
save
her
from
her
folly
by
remonstrating
with
her
and
the
girl
promised
to
give
up
birchill
but
did
not
do
so
when
sir
horace
found
out
that
he
was
being
deceived
he
was
compelled
to
renounce
her
birchill
who
had
been
living
on
the
girl
was
furious
with
anger
when
he
learnt
that
sir
horace
had
cut
off
the
monetary
allowance
he
had
been
making
her
and
on
discovering
by
some
means
that
his
former
prison
associate
hill
was
now
the
butler
at
sir
horace
fewbanks
house
he
planned
his
revenge
he
sent
the
girl
fanning
to
riversbrook
with
a
message
to
hill
directing
him
under
threat
of
exposure
to
see
him
at
the
westminster
flat
hill
who
dreaded
nothing
so
much
as
an
exposure
of
that
past
life
of
his
which
he
hoped
was
a
secret
between
his
master
and
himself
kept
the
appointment
birchill
told
him
he
intended
to
rob
the
judge
house
in
order
to
revenge
himself
on
sir
horace
for
cutting
off
the
allowance
and
he
asked
hill
to
assist
him
in
carrying
out
the
burglary
hill
strenuously
demurred
at
first
but
weakly
allowed
himself
to
be
terrorised
into
compliance
under
birchill
threats
of
exposure
participation
in
the
crime
was
to
be
confined
to
preparing
a
plan
of
riversbrook
as
a
guide
for
birchill
birchill
said
nothing
about
murder
at
this
time
but
there
is
no
doubt
he
contemplated
violence
when
he
first
spoke
to
hill
when
hill
alarmed
by
his
master
return
on
the
actual
night
for
which
the
burglary
had
been
arranged
hurried
across
to
the
flat
to
urge
birchill
to
abandon
the
contemplated
burglary
birchill
obstinately
decided
to
carry
out
the
crime
and
left
the
flat
with
a
revolver
in
his
hand
threatening
to
murder
sir
horace
if
he
found
him
because
of
his
harsh
treatment
as
he
termed
it
of
the
girl
fanning
birchill
left
the
flat
at
nine
continued
walters
who
had
now
reached
the
vital
facts
of
the
night
of
the
murder
i
ask
the
jury
to
take
careful
note
of
the
time
and
the
subsequent
times
mentioned
for
they
have
an
important
bearing
on
the
circumstantial
evidence
against
the
accused
man
he
returned
according
to
hill
evidence
shortly
after
midnight
evidence
will
be
called
to
show
that
birchill
or
a
man
answering
his
description
boarded
a
tramcar
at
euston
road
at
and
journeyed
in
it
to
hampstead
he
was
observed
both
at
euston
road
and
the
hampstead
terminus
by
the
conductor
because
of
his
obvious
desire
to
avoid
attention
there
were
only
two
other
passengers
on
the
top
of
the
car
when
it
left
euston
road
the
conductor
directed
the
attention
of
the
driver
to
his
movements
and
they
both
watched
him
till
he
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
heath
in
fairness
to
the
prisoner
it
was
necessary
to
point
out
however
that
neither
the
conductor
nor
the
driver
can
identify
him
positively
as
the
man
they
had
seen
on
their
car
that
night
but
both
will
swear
that
to
the
best
of
their
belief
birchill
is
the
man
assuming
that
it
was
the
prisoner
who
travelled
to
hampstead
by
the
euston
road
tram
a
route
he
would
probably
prefer
because
it
took
him
to
hampstead
by
the
most
unfrequented
way
he
would
have
a
distance
of
nearly
a
mile
to
walk
across
hampstead
heath
to
tanton
gardens
where
sir
horace
fewbanks
house
was
situated
the
evidence
of
the
is
that
he
set
off
across
the
heath
at
a
very
rapid
rate
the
tram
reached
hampstead
at
four
minutes
past
ten
so
that
by
walking
fast
it
would
be
possible
for
a
young
energetic
man
to
reach
riversbrook
before
a
quarter
to
eleven
another
five
minutes
would
see
an
experienced
housebreaker
like
birchill
inside
the
house
at
twenty
minutes
past
eleven
a
young
man
named
ryder
who
had
wandered
into
tanton
gardens
while
endeavouring
to
take
a
short
cut
home
heard
the
sound
of
a
report
which
at
the
time
he
took
to
be
the
noise
of
a
door
violently
slammed
coming
from
the
direction
of
riversbrook
a
few
moments
afterwards
he
saw
a
man
climb
over
the
front
fence
of
riversbrook
to
the
street
he
drew
back
cautiously
into
the
shade
of
one
of
the
chestnut
trees
of
the
street
avenue
and
saw
the
man
plainly
as
he
ran
past
him
ryder
will
swear
that
the
man
he
saw
was
birchill
it
a
lie
it
a
lie
you
trying
to
hang
him
you
wicked
man
oh
fred
fred
the
cry
proceeded
from
the
girl
doris
fanning
her
unbalanced
temperament
had
been
unable
to
bear
the
strain
of
sitting
there
and
listening
to
walters
cold
inexorable
construction
of
a
legal
chain
of
evidence
against
her
lover
she
rose
to
her
feet
shrieking
wildly
and
gesticulating
menacingly
at
walters
the
society
ladies
turned
eagerly
in
their
seats
to
take
in
through
their
every
detail
of
the
interruption
remove
that
woman
the
judge
sternly
commanded
several
policemen
hastened
to
her
and
the
girl
was
partly
hustled
and
partly
carried
out
of
court
shrieking
as
she
went
when
the
commotion
caused
by
the
scene
subsided
the
judge
irritably
requested
to
be
informed
who
the
woman
was
i
do
know
my
lord
replied
walters
perhaps
he
stopped
and
bent
over
to
detective
rolfe
who
was
pulling
at
his
gown
er
yes
informed
by
detective
rolfe
of
scotland
yard
my
lord
that
the
young
woman
is
a
witness
in
the
case
then
why
was
she
permitted
to
remain
in
court
asked
sir
henry
hodson
angrily
it
is
a
piece
of
gross
carelessness
i
do
not
know
my
lord
i
was
unaware
she
was
a
witness
until
this
moment
returned
walters
with
a
discreet
glance
in
the
direction
of
detective
rolfe
as
an
indication
to
his
honour
that
the
judicial
storm
might
safely
veer
in
that
direction
sir
henry
took
the
hint
and
administered
such
a
stinging
rebuke
to
detective
rolfe
that
that
officer
face
took
on
a
much
redder
tint
before
it
was
concluded
then
the
judge
motioned
to
walters
to
resume
the
case
counsel
with
his
index
finger
still
in
the
place
in
his
brief
where
he
had
been
interrupted
rose
to
his
feet
again
and
turned
to
the
jury
birchill
returned
to
the
flat
at
westminster
shortly
after
midnight
he
continued
hill
had
been
compelled
by
birchill
threats
to
remain
at
the
flat
with
the
girl
while
birchill
visited
riversbrook
and
the
first
thing
birchill
told
him
on
his
return
was
that
he
had
found
sir
horace
fewbanks
dead
in
his
house
when
he
entered
it
on
his
way
back
from
committing
the
crime
belated
caution
had
probably
dictated
to
birchill
the
wisdom
of
endeavouring
to
counteract
his
previous
threat
to
murder
sir
horace
fewbanks
he
probably
remembered
that
hill
who
had
heard
the
threat
was
an
unwilling
participator
in
the
plan
for
the
burglary
and
might
therefore
denounce
him
to
the
police
for
the
greater
crime
if
he
birchill
admitted
that
he
had
committed
it
in
order
to
guard
against
this
contingency
still
further
birchill
forced
hill
to
join
in
writing
a
letter
to
scotland
yard
acquainting
them
with
the
murder
and
the
fact
that
the
body
was
lying
in
the
empty
house
birchill
object
in
acting
thus
was
a
twofold
one
he
dared
not
trust
hill
to
pretend
to
discover
the
body
the
next
day
and
give
information
to
the
police
for
fear
he
should
not
be
able
to
retain
sufficient
control
of
himself
to
convince
the
detectives
that
he
was
wholly
ignorant
of
the
crime
and
he
also
thought
that
if
hill
had
a
share
in
writing
the
letter
he
would
feel
an
additional
complicity
in
the
crime
and
keep
silence
for
his
own
sake
birchill
was
right
in
his
calculations
up
to
a
point
hill
was
at
first
too
frightened
to
disclose
what
he
knew
but
as
time
went
on
his
affection
for
his
murdered
master
and
his
desire
to
bring
the
murderer
to
justice
overcame
his
feelings
of
fear
for
his
own
share
in
bringing
about
the
crime
and
he
went
and
confessed
everything
to
the
police
regardless
of
the
consequences
that
might
recoil
upon
his
own
head
the
case
against
birchill
depends
largely
on
hill
evidence
and
the
jury
when
they
have
heard
his
story
in
the
and
bearing
in
mind
the
extenuating
circumstances
of
his
connection
with
the
crime
will
have
little
hesitation
in
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
the
prisoner
in
the
dock
murdered
sir
horace
fewbanks
the
first
witness
called
was
inspector
seldon
who
gave
evidence
as
to
his
visit
to
riversbrook
shortly
before
on
the
of
august
as
the
result
of
information
received
and
his
discovery
of
the
dead
body
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
he
described
the
room
in
which
the
body
was
found
the
position
of
the
body
and
he
identified
the
clothes
produced
by
the
prosecution
as
being
those
in
which
the
dead
man
was
dressed
when
the
body
was
discovered
in
by
holymead
he
stated
that
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
fully
dressed
when
the
body
was
found
the
witness
also
stated
in
that
none
of
the
electric
lights
in
the
house
were
burning
when
the
body
was
discovered
the
next
witness
was
slingsby
the
pathological
expert
from
the
home
office
who
had
made
the
post
mortem
examination
and
who
was
much
too
great
a
man
to
be
kept
waiting
while
other
witnesses
of
more
importance
to
the
case
but
of
less
personal
consequence
went
into
the
box
slingsby
stated
that
his
examinations
had
revealed
that
death
had
been
caused
by
a
bullet
wound
which
had
penetrated
the
left
lung
causing
internal
hemorrhage
finnis
the
junior
counsel
for
the
defence
suggested
to
the
witness
that
the
wound
might
have
been
but
slingsby
permitted
himself
to
be
positive
that
such
was
not
the
case
with
professional
caution
he
assured
finnis
who
briefly
him
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
state
how
long
sir
horace
fewbanks
had
been
dead
in
the
case
of
the
human
body
set
in
from
eight
to
ten
hours
after
death
and
it
was
between
three
and
four
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
the
crime
was
discovered
that
he
first
saw
the
corpse
the
body
was
quite
stiff
and
cold
then
is
it
not
possible
for
death
to
have
taken
place
nineteen
or
twenty
hours
before
you
saw
the
body
asked
finnis
eagerly
quite
possible
replied
slingsby
is
it
not
also
possible
from
the
state
of
the
body
when
you
examined
it
that
death
took
place
within
sixteen
hours
of
your
examination
of
the
body
asked
walters
as
finnis
sat
down
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
elicited
an
important
point
quite
possible
replied
slingsby
with
the
prim
air
of
a
professional
man
who
valued
his
reputation
too
highly
to
risk
it
by
committing
himself
to
anything
definite
slingsby
was
allowed
to
leave
the
box
and
inspector
chippenfield
took
his
place
inspector
chippenfield
did
not
display
any
professional
reticence
about
giving
his
evidence
at
least
not
on
the
surface
though
he
by
no
means
took
the
court
completely
into
his
confidence
as
to
all
that
had
passed
between
him
and
hill
on
the
other
hand
he
told
the
judge
and
jury
everything
that
his
professional
experience
prompted
him
as
necessary
and
proper
for
them
to
know
in
order
to
bring
about
a
conviction
in
the
course
of
his
evidence
he
made
several
attempts
to
introduce
damaging
facts
as
to
birchill
past
but
holymead
protested
to
the
judge
counsel
for
the
defence
protested
that
he
had
allowed
his
learned
friend
in
opening
the
case
a
great
deal
of
latitude
as
to
the
relations
which
had
previously
existed
between
the
witness
hill
and
the
prisoner
because
the
defence
did
not
intend
to
attempt
to
hide
the
fact
that
the
prisoner
had
a
criminal
record
but
he
had
no
intention
of
allowing
a
police
witness
to
introduce
irrelevant
matter
in
order
to
prejudice
the
jury
against
the
prisoner
his
honour
told
the
witness
to
confine
himself
to
answering
the
questions
put
to
him
and
not
to
volunteer
information
after
this
rebuke
inspector
chippenfield
resumed
giving
evidence
he
related
what
birchill
had
said
when
arrested
and
declared
that
he
was
positive
that
the
footprints
found
outside
the
kitchen
window
were
made
by
the
boots
produced
in
court
which
birchill
had
been
wearing
at
the
time
he
was
arrested
he
produced
a
jemmy
which
he
had
found
at
flat
and
said
that
it
fitted
the
marks
on
the
window
at
riversbrook
which
had
been
forced
on
the
night
of
the
of
august
inspector
chippenfield
evidence
was
followed
by
that
of
the
two
tramway
employees
who
declared
that
to
the
best
of
their
belief
birchill
was
the
man
who
boarded
their
tram
at
nine
on
the
night
of
the
of
august
and
rode
to
the
terminus
at
hampstead
which
they
reached
at
both
the
witnesses
showed
a
very
proper
respect
for
the
law
and
were
obviously
relieved
when
the
brief
was
over
and
they
were
free
to
go
back
to
their
chapter
xvii
james
hill
called
the
court
crier
the
butler
stepped
forward
mounted
the
and
bowed
his
head
deferentially
towards
the
judge
he
was
neatly
dressed
in
black
and
his
hair
was
carefully
brushed
his
face
was
as
expressionless
as
ever
but
a
slight
oscillation
of
the
court
bible
in
his
right
hand
as
he
was
sworn
indicated
that
his
nerves
were
not
so
calm
as
he
strove
to
appear
he
looked
neither
to
the
right
nor
left
but
kept
his
glance
downcast
only
once
as
he
stood
there
waiting
to
be
questioned
did
he
cast
a
furtive
look
towards
the
man
whose
life
hung
on
his
evidence
but
the
malevolent
vindictive
gaze
birchill
shot
back
at
him
caused
him
to
lower
his
eyelids
instantly
hill
commenced
his
evidence
in
a
voice
so
low
that
walters
stopped
him
at
the
outset
and
asked
him
to
speak
in
a
louder
tone
it
soon
became
apparent
that
his
evidence
was
making
a
deep
impression
on
the
court
sir
henry
hodson
listened
to
him
intently
and
watched
him
keenly
as
hill
with
impassive
countenance
and
smooth
even
tones
told
his
strange
story
of
the
night
of
the
murder
when
he
had
drawn
to
a
conclusion
he
gave
another
furtive
glance
at
the
dock
but
birchill
was
seated
with
his
head
bowed
down
as
though
tired
and
with
one
hand
supporting
his
face
walters
methodically
folded
up
his
brief
and
sat
down
with
a
sidelong
glance
in
the
direction
of
holymead
as
he
did
so
every
eye
in
court
was
turned
on
holymead
as
the
great
settled
his
gown
on
his
shoulders
and
got
up
to
the
principal
crown
witness
his
was
the
admiration
of
those
spectators
whose
sympathies
were
on
the
side
of
the
man
in
the
dock
as
one
of
themselves
hill
was
as
to
the
lapse
from
honesty
which
had
sent
him
to
gaol
and
he
was
reluctantly
forced
to
admit
that
so
far
from
the
theft
being
the
result
of
an
impulse
to
save
his
wife
and
child
from
starvation
as
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
had
indicated
it
was
the
result
of
the
impulse
of
cupidity
he
had
robbed
a
master
who
had
trusted
him
and
had
treated
him
with
kindness
having
extracted
this
fact
in
spite
of
hill
evasions
and
twistings
holymead
straightened
himself
to
his
full
height
and
shaking
a
warning
finger
at
the
witness
said
i
put
it
to
you
witness
that
the
reason
sir
horace
fewbanks
engaged
you
as
butler
in
his
household
at
riversbrook
was
because
he
knew
you
to
be
a
man
of
few
scruples
who
would
be
willing
to
do
things
that
a
more
upright
honest
man
would
have
objected
to
that
is
not
true
replied
hill
is
it
not
true
that
your
late
master
frequently
entertained
women
of
doubtful
character
at
riversbrook
thundered
the
hill
gasped
at
the
question
when
he
had
first
heard
that
his
late
master
old
friend
holymead
was
to
appear
for
birchill
he
had
immediately
come
to
the
conclusion
that
holymead
was
taking
up
the
case
in
order
to
save
sir
horace
name
from
exposure
by
dealing
carefully
with
his
private
life
at
riversbrook
but
here
he
was
ruthlessly
tearing
aside
the
veil
of
secrecy
hill
hesitated
he
glanced
round
the
curious
crowded
court
and
saw
the
eager
glances
of
the
women
as
they
impatiently
awaited
his
reply
he
hesitated
so
long
that
holymead
repeated
the
question
women
of
doubtful
character
faltered
the
witness
i
do
not
understand
you
you
understand
me
perfectly
well
hill
i
do
not
mean
women
off
the
streets
but
women
who
have
no
moral
reputation
to
maintain
women
who
do
not
mind
letting
confidential
servants
see
that
they
have
no
regard
for
the
conventional
standards
of
life
i
mean
witness
that
your
late
master
frequently
entertained
at
riversbrook
women
i
will
not
call
them
ladies
who
were
not
particular
at
what
hour
they
went
home
sometimes
one
or
more
of
them
stayed
all
night
and
you
were
entrusted
with
the
confidential
task
of
smuggling
them
out
of
the
house
without
other
servants
knowing
of
their
presence
is
not
that
so
i
i
answer
the
question
without
equivocation
witness
sir
there
was
a
slight
stir
in
the
body
of
the
court
due
to
the
fact
that
miss
fewbanks
and
holymead
had
risen
and
were
making
their
way
to
the
door
the
women
in
the
court
stared
with
much
interest
at
the
daughter
of
the
murdered
man
whom
most
of
them
knew
in
order
to
see
how
she
was
taking
the
disclosures
about
her
dead
private
life
and
sometimes
there
were
quarrels
between
your
late
master
and
these
visitors
were
there
not
continued
holymead
quarrels
sir
surely
you
know
that
under
the
influence
of
wine
some
people
become
quarrelsome
yes
sir
well
did
your
late
master
nocturnal
visitors
ever
become
quarrelsome
sometimes
sir
in
the
exercise
of
your
confidential
duties
did
you
sometimes
see
quarrelsome
ladies
off
the
premises
sometimes
sir
and
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
them
to
say
things
to
you
about
your
master
eh
sometimes
they
did
care
what
they
said
quite
so
commented
counsel
drily
they
indulged
in
threats
not
all
of
them
replied
hill
who
at
length
saw
where
the
was
tending
i
do
not
suggest
that
all
of
them
did
only
that
the
more
violent
of
them
did
so
quite
so
sir
so
we
may
take
it
that
the
quarrel
between
your
late
master
and
miss
fanning
was
not
the
only
quarrel
of
the
kind
which
came
under
your
notice
there
were
not
many
others
said
hill
it
was
not
the
only
one
persisted
counsel
no
sir
in
your
you
said
nothing
about
miss
fanning
using
threats
against
your
master
when
you
were
showing
her
out
no
sir
she
did
not
use
any
not
in
my
hearing
sir
there
was
a
pause
at
this
stage
while
holymead
consulted
the
notes
he
had
made
of
walters
of
the
witness
what
was
it
when
you
left
riversbrook
on
the
of
august
after
your
master
return
from
scotland
about
seven
sir
and
what
time
did
sir
horace
arrive
home
about
seven
sir
what
were
you
doing
between
seven
and
i
unpacked
his
bags
and
got
his
bedroom
ready
i
took
him
some
refreshment
up
to
the
library
and
he
told
you
he
would
want
you
again
until
the
following
night
about
eight
yes
sir
he
said
he
thought
he
would
be
going
back
to
scotland
by
the
night
express
and
i
was
to
get
his
bag
packed
and
lock
up
the
house
you
told
counsel
for
the
prosecution
in
the
course
of
your
evidence
that
you
were
afraid
of
birchill
continued
holymead
yes
sir
were
you
afraid
of
physical
violence
from
him
or
only
that
he
would
expose
your
past
to
the
other
servants
i
was
afraid
of
him
both
ways
said
hill
was
it
because
of
this
fear
that
you
made
out
for
him
a
plan
of
riversbrook
to
assist
him
in
the
burglary
yes
sir
when
did
you
make
out
this
plan
the
day
after
sir
horace
left
for
scotland
was
that
on
your
first
visit
to
miss
fanning
flat
in
westminster
after
the
prisoner
had
sent
her
to
riversbrook
to
tell
you
he
wanted
to
see
you
yes
sir
did
birchill
stand
over
you
while
you
made
out
this
plan
yes
sir
would
you
know
the
plan
again
if
you
saw
it
yes
sir
finnis
who
had
been
hiding
the
plan
under
the
papers
before
him
handed
a
document
up
to
his
chief
holymead
unfolded
it
and
with
a
brief
glance
at
it
handed
it
up
to
the
witness
is
that
the
plan
he
asked
hill
was
somewhat
taken
aback
at
the
production
of
the
plan
it
was
drawn
in
ink
on
a
white
sheet
of
paper
of
foolscap
size
with
a
slightly
bluish
tint
the
paper
was
by
no
means
clean
for
birchill
had
carried
it
about
in
his
pocket
the
witness
reluctantly
admitted
that
the
plan
was
the
one
he
had
given
to
birchill
to
his
manifest
relief
counsel
asked
no
further
questions
about
it
in
a
low
tone
holymead
formally
expressed
his
intention
to
put
the
plan
in
as
evidence
he
handed
it
to
walters
who
after
a
close
inspection
of
it
passed
it
along
to
the
associate
for
his
honour
inspection
the
rest
of
hill
concerned
what
happened
at
the
flat
on
the
night
of
the
burglary
he
adhered
to
the
story
he
had
told
and
could
not
be
shaken
in
the
main
points
of
it
but
holymead
made
some
effective
use
of
the
discrepancy
between
the
witness
evidence
at
the
inquest
as
to
his
movements
on
the
night
of
the
murder
and
his
evidence
in
court
he
elicited
the
fact
that
the
police
had
discovered
his
evidence
at
the
inquest
was
false
and
had
forced
him
to
make
a
confession
by
threatening
to
arrest
him
for
the
murder
holymead
signified
that
he
had
nothing
further
to
ask
the
witness
and
walters
called
his
last
witness
a
young
man
named
charles
ryder
a
resident
of
liverpool
who
had
spent
a
week
holiday
in
london
from
the
to
the
of
august
ryder
had
stayed
with
some
friends
at
hampstead
and
when
making
his
way
home
on
the
night
of
the
of
august
had
walked
down
tanton
gardens
in
the
belief
that
he
was
taking
a
short
cut
the
time
was
about
he
saw
a
man
running
towards
him
along
the
footpath
from
the
direction
of
riversbrook
he
caught
a
good
glimpse
of
the
man
who
seemed
to
be
very
excited
he
was
sure
the
prisoner
was
the
man
he
had
seen
in
by
holymead
he
was
far
less
positive
in
his
identification
of
the
prisoner
and
finally
admitted
that
the
man
he
saw
that
night
might
be
somebody
else
who
resembled
the
prisoner
in
build
chapter
xviii
the
second
day
of
the
trial
began
promptly
when
justice
hodson
took
his
seat
holymead
opening
statement
to
the
jury
was
brief
he
reminded
them
that
the
life
of
a
fellow
creature
rested
on
their
verdict
if
there
was
any
doubt
in
their
minds
whether
the
prisoner
had
fired
the
shot
which
killed
sir
horace
fewbanks
the
prisoner
was
entitled
to
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
it
was
obligatory
on
the
prosecution
to
prove
guilt
beyond
all
reasonable
doubt
he
submitted
that
the
prosecution
had
not
established
their
case
after
hearing
the
case
for
the
prosecution
the
jury
must
have
grave
doubts
as
to
the
guilt
of
the
prisoner
and
it
was
his
duty
as
counsel
for
the
prisoner
to
put
before
the
jury
facts
which
would
not
only
increase
their
doubts
but
bring
them
to
the
positive
conclusion
that
the
prisoner
was
not
guilty
he
was
not
going
to
attempt
to
deny
that
the
prisoner
went
to
riversbrook
on
the
night
of
the
murder
he
went
there
to
commit
a
burglary
but
so
far
from
hill
being
terrorised
into
complicity
in
that
crime
it
was
he
who
had
first
suggested
it
to
birchill
and
had
arranged
it
material
evidence
on
that
point
would
be
submitted
to
the
jury
hill
was
a
man
who
was
incapable
of
gratitude
his
disposition
was
to
bite
the
hand
that
fed
him
after
being
well
treated
by
sir
horace
fewbanks
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
rob
him
as
he
had
robbed
his
former
master
lord
melhurst
he
knew
that
sir
horace
had
quarrelled
with
this
girl
fanning
because
of
her
association
with
birchill
and
he
went
to
birchill
and
put
before
him
a
proposal
to
rob
riversbrook
birchill
consented
to
the
plan
and
when
on
the
night
of
the
august
he
broke
into
the
house
he
found
the
murdered
body
of
sir
horace
in
the
library
that
was
the
full
extent
of
the
prisoner
connection
with
the
crime
to
the
superficial
and
suspicious
mind
it
might
seem
an
improbable
story
but
to
an
earnest
mind
it
was
a
story
that
carried
conviction
because
of
its
simple
straightforwardness
its
crudity
if
the
jury
liked
to
call
it
that
it
lacked
the
subtlety
and
the
finish
of
a
concocted
story
the
murder
took
place
before
birchill
reached
riversbrook
on
his
burglarious
errand
it
is
my
place
added
holymead
in
concluding
his
address
to
convince
you
that
my
client
is
not
guilty
or
in
other
words
to
convince
you
that
the
murder
was
committed
before
he
reached
the
house
it
is
only
with
the
greatest
reluctance
that
i
take
upon
myself
the
responsibility
of
pointing
an
accusing
finger
at
another
man
in
crimes
of
this
kind
you
can
not
expect
to
get
anything
but
circumstantial
evidence
but
there
are
degrees
of
circumstantial
evidence
and
my
duty
to
my
client
lays
upon
me
the
obligation
of
pointing
out
to
you
that
there
is
one
person
against
whom
the
existing
circumstantial
evidence
is
stronger
than
it
is
against
my
client
crewe
who
had
secured
his
former
place
in
the
gallery
of
the
court
looked
down
on
the
speaker
he
had
carefully
followed
every
word
of
holymead
address
but
the
concluding
portion
almost
electrified
him
he
flattered
himself
that
he
was
the
only
person
in
court
who
understood
the
full
significance
of
the
sonorous
sentences
with
which
the
famous
concluded
his
address
to
the
jury
as
his
eyes
wandered
over
the
body
of
the
court
below
crewe
saw
that
holymead
and
mademoiselle
chiron
were
sitting
in
one
of
the
back
seats
but
that
they
were
not
accompanied
by
miss
fewbanks
it
was
evident
to
him
by
the
way
in
which
holymead
followed
the
proceedings
that
her
interest
in
the
case
was
something
far
deeper
than
wifely
interest
in
her
husband
connection
with
it
as
counsel
for
the
defence
leaning
forward
in
her
seat
with
her
hands
clasped
in
her
lap
she
listened
eagerly
to
every
word
during
the
day
his
gaze
went
back
to
her
at
intervals
and
on
several
occasions
he
became
aware
that
she
had
been
watching
him
while
he
watched
her
husband
the
first
witness
for
the
defence
was
doris
fanning
the
drift
of
her
evidence
was
to
exonerate
the
prisoner
at
the
expense
of
hill
she
declared
that
she
had
not
gone
to
riversbrook
to
see
hill
after
the
final
quarrel
with
sir
horace
hill
had
come
to
her
flat
in
westminster
of
his
own
accord
and
had
asked
for
birchill
she
went
out
of
the
room
while
they
discussed
their
business
but
after
hill
had
gone
birchill
told
her
that
hill
had
put
up
a
job
for
him
at
riversbrook
birchill
showed
her
the
plan
of
riversbrook
that
hill
had
made
and
asked
her
if
it
was
correct
as
far
as
she
knew
yes
she
was
sure
she
would
know
the
plan
again
if
she
saw
it
the
judge
associate
handed
it
to
holymead
who
passed
it
to
the
witness
is
this
it
he
asked
yes
she
replied
emphatically
almost
without
inspecting
it
i
want
you
to
look
at
it
closely
said
counsel
when
birchill
showed
you
the
plan
immediately
after
hill
departure
what
impression
did
you
get
regarding
it
she
looked
at
him
blankly
i
do
understand
you
she
said
you
can
tell
the
difference
between
ink
that
has
been
newly
used
and
ink
that
has
been
on
the
paper
some
days
was
the
ink
fresh
no
it
was
old
ink
she
said
how
do
you
know
that
because
ink
does
go
black
till
a
long
while
after
it
is
written
at
least
the
letters
write
do
she
shot
a
veiled
coquettish
glance
at
the
big
from
under
her
long
eyelashes
the
returned
the
glance
with
a
genial
smile
what
do
you
write
your
letters
on
miss
fanning
she
almost
giggled
at
the
question
i
use
a
writing
tablet
she
replied
ruled
or
unruled
ruled
i
could
write
straight
if
there
were
lines
she
smiled
again
and
what
colour
do
you
affect
grey
or
white
paper
always
white
is
that
all
the
paper
you
have
at
your
flat
for
writing
purposes
yes
then
what
did
birchill
write
on
when
he
wanted
to
write
a
letter
he
used
mine
are
you
sure
of
that
yes
when
he
wanted
to
write
a
letter
he
used
to
ask
me
for
my
tablet
and
an
envelope
and
generally
he
used
to
borrow
a
stamp
as
well
she
pouted
slightly
with
another
coquettish
glance
look
at
that
plan
again
said
the
have
you
ever
had
paper
like
it
at
your
flat
she
shook
her
head
never
have
you
ever
seen
paper
of
that
kind
in
birchill
possession
before
he
showed
you
the
plan
never
when
he
showed
you
the
plan
had
the
paper
been
folded
yes
the
took
the
witness
now
very
much
at
her
ease
to
the
night
of
the
murder
she
denied
strenuously
that
hill
tried
to
dissuade
birchill
from
carrying
out
the
burglary
because
sir
horace
fewbanks
had
returned
unexpectedly
from
scotland
it
was
birchill
who
suggested
postponing
the
burglary
until
sir
horace
left
but
hill
urged
that
the
original
plan
should
be
adhered
to
he
declared
that
sir
horace
would
remain
at
home
at
least
a
fortnight
and
perhaps
longer
his
master
was
a
sound
sleeper
he
said
and
if
birchill
waited
until
he
went
to
bed
there
would
be
no
danger
of
awakening
him
she
contradicted
many
details
of
hill
evidence
as
to
what
took
place
when
the
prisoner
returned
from
breaking
into
riversbrook
it
was
untrue
she
said
that
there
was
a
spot
of
blood
on
birchill
face
or
that
his
hands
were
smeared
with
blood
he
was
a
little
bit
excited
when
he
returned
but
after
one
glass
of
whisky
he
spoke
quite
calmly
of
what
had
happened
the
next
witness
was
a
representative
of
the
firm
of
holmes
and
jackson
papermakers
who
was
handed
the
plan
of
riversbrook
which
hill
had
drawn
he
stated
that
the
paper
on
which
the
plan
was
drawn
was
manufactured
by
his
firm
and
supplied
to
his
majesty
stationery
office
he
identified
it
by
the
quality
of
the
paper
and
the
watermark
in
reply
to
walters
the
witness
was
sure
that
the
paper
he
held
in
his
hand
had
been
manufactured
by
his
firm
for
the
government
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
be
mistaken
other
firms
might
manufacture
paper
of
a
somewhat
similar
quality
and
tint
but
it
would
not
be
exactly
similar
besides
he
identified
it
by
his
firm
watermark
and
he
held
the
plan
up
to
the
light
and
pointed
it
out
to
the
court
counsel
for
the
defence
called
two
more
witnesses
on
this
point
one
to
prove
that
supplies
of
the
paper
on
which
the
plan
was
drawn
were
issued
to
legal
departments
of
the
government
and
an
elderly
man
named
cobb
sir
horace
fewbanks
former
tipstaff
who
stated
that
he
took
some
of
the
paper
in
question
to
riversbrook
on
sir
horace
instructions
and
then
to
the
astonishment
of
junior
members
of
the
bar
who
were
in
court
watching
his
conduct
of
the
case
in
order
to
see
if
they
could
pick
up
a
few
hints
he
intimated
that
his
case
was
closed
it
seemed
to
them
that
the
great
had
put
up
a
very
flimsy
case
for
the
defence
and
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
case
rested
mainly
on
the
evidence
of
a
tainted
witness
holymead
would
be
very
hard
put
to
it
to
get
his
man
off
is
my
learned
friend
going
to
call
the
prisoner
suggested
walters
with
the
cunning
design
of
giving
the
jury
something
to
think
of
when
they
were
listening
to
his
learned
friend
address
it
scarcely
necessary
said
holymead
who
saw
the
trap
and
replied
in
a
tone
which
indicated
that
the
matter
was
not
worth
a
moment
consideration
he
began
his
address
to
the
jury
by
emphasising
the
fact
that
a
fellow
creature
life
depended
on
the
result
of
their
deliberations
the
duty
that
rested
upon
them
of
saying
whether
the
prosecution
had
established
beyond
all
reasonable
doubt
that
the
prisoner
shot
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
a
solemn
and
impressive
one
he
asked
them
to
consider
the
case
carefully
in
all
its
bearings
he
could
not
claim
for
his
client
that
he
was
a
man
of
spotless
reputation
the
prisoner
belonged
to
a
class
who
earned
their
living
by
warring
against
society
but
that
fact
did
not
make
him
a
murderer
on
what
did
the
case
for
the
prosecution
rest
on
the
evidence
of
hill
and
three
other
witnesses
who
on
the
night
of
the
murder
had
seen
a
man
somewhat
resembling
the
prisoner
in
the
vicinity
of
riversbrook
or
making
towards
the
vicinity
of
that
house
but
so
far
from
wishing
to
emphasise
the
weakness
of
identification
he
admitted
that
the
prisoner
went
to
riversbrook
with
the
intention
of
committing
a
burglary
we
admit
that
he
went
there
the
night
sir
horace
fewbanks
returned
from
scotland
he
continued
counsel
for
the
prosecution
will
make
the
most
of
those
admissions
in
the
course
of
his
address
to
you
but
the
point
to
which
i
wish
to
direct
your
attention
is
that
we
make
this
damaging
admission
so
that
you
may
decide
between
the
prisoner
and
the
man
who
led
him
into
a
trap
by
instigating
the
burglary
now
we
come
to
the
evidence
of
hill
i
know
you
will
not
convict
a
man
of
murder
on
the
unsupported
evidence
of
a
fellow
criminal
but
i
want
to
point
out
to
you
that
even
if
hill
evidence
were
true
in
every
detail
even
if
hill
had
not
swerved
one
iota
from
the
truth
there
is
nothing
in
his
evidence
to
lead
to
the
positive
conclusion
that
the
prisoner
murdered
hill
master
sir
horace
fewbanks
what
does
hill
evidence
against
the
prisoner
amount
to
let
us
accept
it
for
the
moment
as
absolutely
true
later
on
i
will
show
you
plainly
that
the
man
is
a
liar
that
he
is
a
cunning
scoundrel
and
that
his
evidence
is
utterly
unreliable
but
accepting
for
the
moment
his
evidence
as
true
the
case
against
the
prisoner
amounts
to
this
by
threats
of
exposure
birchill
compelled
hill
to
consent
to
riversbrook
being
robbed
while
the
owner
was
in
scotland
hill
complicity
according
to
his
own
story
extended
only
to
supplying
a
plan
of
the
house
and
giving
birchill
some
information
as
to
where
various
articles
of
value
would
be
found
on
the
of
august
hill
went
to
riversbrook
to
see
that
everything
was
in
order
for
the
burglary
that
night
while
he
was
there
his
master
returned
unexpectedly
hill
then
went
to
the
flat
in
westminster
and
told
birchill
that
sir
horace
had
returned
his
own
story
is
that
he
tried
to
get
birchill
to
abandon
the
idea
of
the
burglary
but
that
birchill
who
had
been
drinking
swore
that
he
would
carry
out
the
plan
and
that
if
he
came
across
sir
horace
he
would
shoot
him
what
grudge
had
birchill
against
sir
horace
fewbanks
the
fact
that
sir
horace
had
discarded
the
woman
fanning
because
of
her
association
with
birchill
gentlemen
does
a
man
commit
a
murder
for
a
thing
of
that
kind
let
us
test
the
credibility
of
the
man
who
has
tried
to
swear
away
the
life
of
the
prisoner
you
saw
him
in
the
and
i
have
no
doubt
formed
your
own
conclusions
as
to
the
type
of
man
he
is
did
he
strike
you
as
a
man
who
would
stand
by
the
truth
above
all
things
or
a
man
who
would
lie
persistently
in
order
to
save
his
own
skin
that
the
man
can
not
be
believed
even
when
on
his
oath
has
been
publicly
demonstrated
in
the
courts
of
the
land
the
story
he
told
the
court
yesterday
in
the
of
his
movements
on
the
day
of
the
murder
is
quite
different
to
the
story
he
told
on
his
oath
at
the
inquest
on
the
body
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
let
me
read
to
you
the
evidence
he
gave
at
the
inquest
finnis
handed
to
his
leader
a
copy
of
hill
evidence
at
the
inquest
and
holymead
read
it
out
to
the
jury
he
then
read
out
a
shorthand
writer
account
of
hill
evidence
on
the
previous
day
which
of
these
accounts
are
we
to
believe
he
said
turning
to
the
jury
the
latter
one
the
prosecution
says
but
why
i
ask
because
it
tallies
with
the
statement
extorted
from
hill
by
the
police
under
the
threat
of
charging
him
with
the
murder
does
that
make
it
more
credible
is
a
man
like
hill
who
is
placed
in
that
position
likely
to
tell
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
it
is
an
insult
to
the
jury
as
men
of
intelligence
to
ask
you
to
believe
hill
evidence
i
do
not
ask
you
to
believe
the
story
he
told
at
the
inquest
in
preference
to
the
story
he
told
here
in
the
yesterday
i
ask
you
to
regard
both
stories
as
the
evidence
of
a
man
who
is
too
deeply
implicated
in
this
crime
to
be
able
to
speak
the
truth
i
will
prove
to
you
gentlemen
of
the
jury
that
the
man
is
a
criminal
by
instinct
and
a
liar
by
necessity
the
necessity
of
saving
his
own
skin
he
robbed
his
former
master
lord
melhurst
and
he
planned
to
rob
his
late
master
sir
horace
fewbanks
but
knowing
that
his
former
crime
would
be
brought
against
him
when
the
police
came
to
investigate
a
robbery
at
riversbrook
he
was
too
cunning
to
rob
riversbrook
himself
he
looked
about
him
for
an
accomplice
and
he
selected
birchill
you
heard
him
say
in
the
that
he
drew
birchill
a
plan
of
riversbrook
the
plan
i
now
hold
in
my
hand
i
will
ask
you
to
inspect
the
plan
closely
hill
told
us
that
birchill
terrorised
him
into
drawing
this
plan
by
threats
of
exposure
exposure
of
what
his
master
sir
horace
fewbanks
knew
he
had
been
in
gaol
so
what
had
he
to
fear
from
exposure
his
proper
course
if
he
were
an
honest
man
would
have
been
to
tell
his
master
that
birchill
was
planning
to
rob
the
house
and
had
endeavoured
to
draw
him
into
the
crime
but
he
did
nothing
of
the
kind
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
plan
to
rob
riversbrook
was
his
own
and
not
birchill
now
gentlemen
you
have
all
seen
the
plan
which
this
tainted
witness
declares
was
drawn
by
him
because
birchill
terrorised
him
and
stood
over
him
while
he
drew
it
is
there
anything
in
that
plan
to
suggest
that
it
was
drawn
by
a
man
in
a
state
of
nervous
terror
why
the
lines
are
as
firmly
drawn
as
if
they
had
been
made
by
an
architect
working
at
his
leisure
in
his
office
was
this
plan
drawn
by
a
man
in
a
state
of
nervous
terror
with
his
tormentor
standing
threateningly
over
him
or
was
it
drawn
up
by
a
man
working
at
leisure
free
not
only
from
terror
but
from
interruption
the
answer
to
that
question
is
supplied
in
the
evidence
given
by
three
witnesses
as
to
the
paper
used
hill
says
the
plan
was
drawn
at
the
flat
two
other
witnesses
swore
that
it
was
paper
supplied
exclusively
for
government
departments
and
another
witness
swore
that
he
had
taken
such
paper
to
riversbrook
for
the
use
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
who
like
every
one
of
his
majesty
judges
found
it
necessary
to
do
some
of
his
judicial
work
at
home
what
is
the
inevitable
inference
i
ask
you
if
you
can
have
any
doubt
after
looking
at
that
plan
and
after
hearing
the
evidence
given
about
the
paper
that
the
proposal
to
rob
riversbrook
was
hill
own
proposal
that
hill
drew
a
plan
of
the
house
on
paper
he
abstracted
from
his
master
desk
paper
which
this
confidential
servant
was
apparently
in
the
habit
of
using
for
private
purposes
and
that
he
gave
it
to
birchill
when
he
asked
birchill
to
join
him
in
the
crime
when
one
of
the
main
features
of
hill
story
is
proved
to
be
false
how
can
you
believe
any
of
the
rest
in
the
light
in
which
we
now
see
him
with
his
cunning
exposed
what
significance
is
to
be
attached
to
his
statement
that
birchill
in
his
presence
threatened
to
shoot
sir
horace
fewbanks
if
the
master
of
riversbrook
interfered
with
him
such
a
threat
was
not
made
but
why
should
hill
say
it
was
made
for
the
same
reason
that
he
lied
about
the
plan
to
save
his
own
skin
i
submit
to
you
gentlemen
that
when
hill
went
to
see
birchill
at
the
westminster
flat
on
the
night
arranged
for
the
burglary
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
dead
murdered
and
that
hill
knew
he
was
murdered
his
own
story
is
that
he
tried
to
persuade
birchill
to
abandon
the
proposed
burglary
but
according
to
the
witness
fanning
he
did
all
in
his
power
to
induce
birchill
to
carry
out
the
original
plan
when
he
saw
that
birchill
was
disposed
to
postpone
the
burglary
in
view
of
the
return
of
the
master
of
riversbrook
why
did
he
want
birchill
to
carry
out
the
burglary
because
he
knew
that
his
master
murdered
body
was
lying
in
the
house
and
he
wanted
to
be
in
the
position
to
produce
evidence
against
birchill
as
the
murderer
if
he
found
himself
in
a
tight
corner
as
the
result
of
the
subsequent
investigations
of
the
police
remember
that
the
body
of
the
victim
was
fully
dressed
when
it
was
discovered
by
the
police
and
that
none
of
the
electric
lights
were
burning
does
not
that
prove
conclusively
that
the
murder
was
not
committed
by
birchill
that
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
dead
when
birchill
broke
into
the
house
birchill
an
experienced
criminal
would
not
break
into
the
house
while
there
was
anybody
moving
about
he
would
wait
until
the
house
was
in
darkness
and
the
inmates
asleep
to
do
otherwise
would
increase
enormously
the
risks
of
capture
but
the
fact
that
the
police
found
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
fully
dressed
shows
that
sir
horace
was
murdered
before
he
went
to
bed
before
birchill
broke
into
the
house
it
shows
conclusively
that
the
murder
was
committed
before
dusk
your
only
alternatives
to
that
conclusion
are
that
the
murdered
man
went
to
bed
with
his
clothes
on
or
that
the
murderer
broke
into
the
house
before
sir
horace
had
gone
to
bed
and
after
killing
sir
horace
went
coolly
round
the
house
turning
out
the
lights
instead
of
fleeing
in
terror
at
his
deed
without
even
waiting
to
collect
any
booty
i
am
sure
that
as
reasonable
men
you
will
reject
both
these
alternatives
as
absurd
no
evidence
has
been
produced
to
show
that
anything
has
been
stolen
from
the
place
it
was
evidently
the
theory
of
the
prosecution
that
the
prisoner
after
shooting
sir
horace
had
fled
the
evidence
of
hill
was
that
he
arrived
at
fanning
flat
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
his
excitement
would
be
consistent
with
his
story
of
having
discovered
the
body
of
a
murdered
man
but
not
consistent
with
the
conduct
of
a
calculating
murderer
who
had
broken
into
the
house
before
sir
horace
had
undressed
for
bed
had
shot
him
and
had
then
gone
round
the
house
turning
out
the
lights
without
having
any
apparent
object
in
doing
so
gentlemen
i
think
you
will
admit
that
the
crime
must
have
been
committed
before
dusk
before
any
lights
were
turned
on
i
do
not
ask
you
to
say
that
hill
is
guilty
the
responsibility
of
saying
what
man
other
than
the
prisoner
shot
sir
horace
fewbanks
does
not
rest
with
you
but
i
do
urge
you
to
ask
yourselves
whether
as
between
hill
and
the
prisoner
the
probability
of
guilt
is
not
on
the
side
of
this
witness
who
lied
to
the
coroner
court
about
his
movements
on
the
night
of
the
murder
and
who
lied
to
this
court
about
the
plan
for
the
robbery
of
riversbrook
i
have
shown
you
that
hill
was
the
master
mind
in
planning
the
burglary
and
that
being
so
would
not
birchill
have
consented
to
the
postponement
of
the
burglary
if
hill
had
urged
him
to
do
so
when
he
visited
the
flat
after
the
unexpected
return
of
the
master
of
riversbrook
is
not
the
evidence
of
the
witness
fanning
that
hill
urged
birchill
to
carry
out
the
burglary
after
sir
horace
had
gone
to
sleep
more
credible
than
hill
statement
that
he
endeavoured
to
induce
birchill
to
abandon
the
proposed
crime
knowing
what
you
know
of
hill
past
as
a
man
who
will
rob
his
master
knowing
that
he
attempted
to
deceive
you
with
regard
to
this
plan
of
riversbrook
in
order
that
you
might
play
your
part
in
his
cunning
scheme
i
urge
you
to
ask
yourselves
whether
it
is
not
more
probable
that
hill
fired
the
shot
which
killed
sir
horace
fewbanks
than
that
the
prisoner
did
so
is
it
not
extremely
probable
that
the
unexpected
return
of
sir
horace
upset
hill
who
was
giving
a
final
look
round
the
house
before
the
burglary
took
place
that
instead
of
answering
his
master
with
the
suave
obsequious
humility
of
the
servant
he
revealed
the
baffled
ferocity
of
a
criminal
whose
carefully
arranged
plan
seemed
to
have
miscarried
that
his
master
angrily
rebuked
him
and
hill
losing
control
of
himself
sprang
at
sir
horace
and
the
struggle
ended
with
hill
drawing
a
revolver
and
shooting
his
master
the
rest
of
the
story
from
that
point
can
be
constructed
without
difficulty
the
murderer
first
thought
was
to
divert
suspicion
from
himself
and
the
best
way
to
do
that
was
to
divert
suspicion
elsewhere
he
locked
up
the
house
and
went
to
see
birchill
he
urged
birchill
to
break
into
riversbrook
in
which
the
dead
body
of
the
murdered
man
lay
it
is
true
that
he
need
not
have
told
birchill
that
sir
horace
had
returned
unexpectedly
but
his
object
in
doing
so
was
to
make
birchill
search
about
the
house
until
he
inadvertently
stumbled
across
the
dead
body
had
birchill
been
under
the
impression
that
he
had
broken
into
an
entirely
empty
house
he
would
have
collected
the
valuables
and
might
not
have
entered
the
library
in
which
the
dead
body
lay
it
was
necessary
for
hill
purpose
that
birchill
should
come
across
the
corpse
then
he
would
be
vitally
interested
in
diverting
suspicion
from
himself
birchill
and
that
is
why
he
cunningly
revealed
to
birchill
that
sir
horace
had
returned
i
put
it
to
the
jury
that
such
is
a
more
probable
explanation
of
how
sir
horace
met
his
death
than
that
he
was
shot
down
by
birchill
i
ask
you
again
to
remember
that
the
body
was
fully
dressed
when
it
was
found
by
the
police
i
put
it
to
you
that
in
this
matter
the
prisoner
walked
into
a
trap
prepared
by
his
more
cunning
fellow
criminal
and
i
urge
you
with
all
the
earnestness
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
use
when
the
life
of
a
fellow
creature
is
at
stake
not
to
be
led
into
a
trap
not
to
play
the
part
this
cunning
criminal
hill
has
designed
for
you
in
the
sacrifice
of
the
life
of
an
innocent
man
for
the
purpose
of
saving
himself
from
his
just
deserts
looking
at
the
whole
case
as
you
will
not
fail
to
do
with
the
breadth
of
view
of
experienced
men
of
the
world
with
some
knowledge
of
the
workings
of
human
nature
with
a
natural
horror
of
the
depths
of
cunning
of
which
some
natures
are
capable
with
a
deep
sense
of
the
solemn
responsibility
for
a
human
life
upon
you
i
confidently
appeal
to
you
to
say
that
the
prisoner
was
not
the
man
who
shot
sir
horace
fewbanks
and
to
bring
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
a
short
discussion
arose
between
the
bench
and
bar
on
the
question
of
adjourning
the
court
or
continuing
the
case
in
the
hope
of
finishing
it
in
a
few
hours
sir
henry
hodson
wanted
to
finish
the
case
that
night
but
counsel
for
the
prosecution
intimated
that
his
address
to
the
jury
would
take
nearly
two
hours
as
it
was
then
nearly
five
and
his
honour
had
to
sum
up
before
the
jury
could
retire
it
was
hardly
to
be
hoped
that
the
case
could
be
finished
that
night
as
the
jury
might
be
some
time
in
arriving
at
a
verdict
his
honour
decided
to
adjourn
the
court
and
finish
the
case
next
day
chapter
xix
walters
began
his
address
to
the
jury
on
orthodox
lines
he
referred
to
the
fact
that
his
learned
friend
had
warned
them
that
the
life
of
a
fellow
creature
rested
on
their
verdict
it
was
right
that
they
should
keep
that
in
mind
it
was
right
that
they
should
fully
realise
the
responsible
nature
of
the
duty
they
were
called
upon
to
perform
but
it
would
be
wrong
for
them
to
their
responsibility
or
to
feel
weighed
down
by
it
it
would
be
wrong
for
them
to
be
influenced
by
sentimental
considerations
of
the
fact
that
a
fellow
creature
life
was
at
stake
strictly
speaking
that
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
them
their
responsibility
ended
with
their
verdict
if
their
verdict
was
guilty
the
responsibility
of
taking
the
prisoner
life
would
rest
upon
the
law
not
on
the
jury
not
on
his
honour
who
passed
the
sentence
of
death
not
on
the
prison
officials
who
carried
out
the
execution
the
jury
would
do
well
to
keep
in
mind
the
fact
that
their
responsibility
in
this
trial
impressive
and
important
as
every
one
must
acknowledge
it
to
be
was
nevertheless
strictly
limited
as
far
as
the
taking
of
the
life
of
the
prisoner
was
concerned
he
then
went
over
the
evidence
in
detail
building
up
again
the
case
for
the
prosecution
where
holymead
had
made
breaches
in
it
and
attempting
to
demolish
the
case
for
the
defence
hill
he
declared
was
an
honest
witness
the
man
had
made
one
false
step
but
he
had
done
his
best
to
retrieve
it
and
with
the
help
he
had
received
from
his
late
master
sir
horace
fewbanks
he
would
have
buried
the
past
effectively
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
fact
that
the
prisoner
who
was
a
confirmed
criminal
had
determined
to
drag
him
down
there
was
no
doubt
that
hill
association
with
birchill
had
been
unfortunate
for
him
it
had
dragged
his
past
into
the
light
of
day
and
he
stood
before
them
a
ruined
man
he
had
tried
to
live
down
the
past
and
but
for
birchill
he
would
have
succeeded
in
doing
so
but
now
no
one
would
employ
him
as
a
house
servant
after
the
revelations
that
had
been
made
in
this
court
they
had
seen
hill
in
the
and
he
would
ask
the
jury
whether
he
looked
like
the
masterful
cunning
scoundrel
which
the
defence
had
described
or
a
weak
creature
who
would
be
easily
led
by
a
man
of
strong
will
such
as
the
prisoner
was
as
to
what
took
place
at
the
flat
they
had
a
choice
between
the
evidence
of
hill
and
the
evidence
of
the
girl
fanning
hill
had
told
them
that
he
had
tried
to
dissuade
the
prisoner
from
going
to
riversbrook
to
burgle
the
premises
because
his
master
had
returned
unexpectedly
fanning
had
told
them
that
the
prisoner
was
in
favour
of
postponing
the
crime
but
that
hill
had
urged
him
to
carry
it
out
which
story
was
the
more
probable
what
reliance
could
they
place
on
the
evidence
of
fanning
he
did
not
wish
to
say
that
the
witness
was
utterly
vicious
and
incapable
of
telling
the
truth
a
description
that
the
defence
had
applied
to
hill
but
they
must
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
fanning
was
the
prisoner
mistress
was
it
likely
that
a
woman
knowing
her
lover
life
was
at
stake
would
come
here
and
speak
the
truth
if
she
knew
the
truth
would
hang
him
he
was
sure
that
the
jury
as
men
who
knew
the
world
thoroughly
would
not
hesitate
between
the
evidence
of
hill
and
that
of
fanning
the
case
for
the
defence
depended
to
a
great
extent
on
the
plan
of
riversbrook
which
hill
candidly
admitted
he
had
drawn
his
learned
friend
had
called
evidence
to
show
that
the
paper
on
which
the
plan
was
drawn
was
of
a
quality
which
was
not
procurable
by
the
general
public
that
might
be
so
but
what
his
learned
friend
had
not
succeeded
in
doing
and
could
not
possibly
have
hoped
to
succeed
in
doing
was
to
show
that
birchill
could
not
have
obtained
possession
in
any
other
way
of
paper
of
that
kind
yet
it
was
necessary
for
the
defence
to
prove
that
in
order
to
prove
that
the
plan
was
not
drawn
at
fanning
flat
by
hill
under
threats
from
birchill
but
that
hill
had
drawn
it
at
riversbrook
and
that
he
gave
it
to
birchill
in
order
to
induce
him
to
consent
to
the
proposal
to
break
into
the
house
there
were
dozens
of
ways
in
which
paper
of
this
particular
quality
might
have
got
to
the
flat
might
not
birchill
have
a
friend
in
his
majesty
stationery
office
was
it
impossible
that
the
witness
fanning
had
a
friend
in
that
office
or
in
one
of
the
government
departments
to
which
the
paper
was
supplied
was
it
impossible
in
view
of
her
relations
with
the
victim
of
this
crime
for
fanning
to
have
obtained
some
of
the
paper
at
riversbrook
and
to
have
taken
it
home
to
her
flat
she
had
sworn
in
the
that
she
had
not
had
paper
of
that
kind
in
her
possession
but
with
her
lover
life
at
stake
was
she
likely
to
stick
at
a
lie
if
it
would
help
to
get
him
off
counsel
for
the
defence
had
endeavoured
to
make
much
of
the
fact
that
the
dead
body
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
fully
dressed
when
the
police
discovered
it
he
endeavoured
to
persuade
them
that
such
a
fact
established
the
complete
innocence
of
the
prisoner
and
that
because
of
it
they
must
bring
in
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
he
asked
them
to
accept
it
as
evidence
not
only
that
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
dead
when
the
prisoner
broke
into
the
house
but
that
he
was
dead
when
hill
left
riversbrook
at
to
meet
birchill
at
fanning
flat
with
an
ingenuity
which
did
credit
to
his
imagination
he
put
before
them
as
his
theory
of
the
crime
that
a
quarrel
took
place
between
sir
horace
fewbanks
and
hill
at
riversbrook
that
hill
shot
his
master
and
then
went
to
fanning
flat
so
as
to
see
that
birchill
carried
out
the
burglary
as
arranged
and
at
the
same
time
found
sir
horace
dead
body
and
thus
directed
suspicion
to
himself
the
only
support
for
this
theory
was
that
the
body
when
discovered
by
the
police
was
fully
dressed
and
that
none
of
the
electric
lights
were
burning
counsel
for
the
defence
contended
that
these
two
facts
established
his
theory
that
the
murder
was
committed
before
dusk
they
established
nothing
of
the
kind
there
were
half
a
dozen
more
credible
explanations
of
these
things
than
the
one
he
asked
the
jury
to
accept
what
mystery
was
there
in
a
man
being
fully
dressed
in
his
own
house
at
midnight
the
defence
had
been
at
great
pains
to
show
that
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
a
man
of
somewhat
irregular
habits
in
his
private
life
did
not
that
suggest
that
he
might
have
turned
off
the
lights
and
gone
to
sleep
in
an
in
the
library
with
the
intention
of
going
out
in
an
hour
or
two
to
keep
an
appointment
if
he
had
an
appointment
and
his
sudden
and
unexpected
return
from
scotland
would
suggest
that
he
had
a
secret
and
important
appointment
he
would
be
more
likely
to
take
a
short
nap
in
his
chair
than
to
undress
and
go
to
bed
might
not
the
prisoner
who
was
a
bold
and
reckless
man
have
broken
into
the
house
when
the
lights
were
burning
and
his
victim
was
awake
and
fully
dressed
in
that
case
what
was
to
prevent
his
turning
off
the
lights
before
leaving
the
house
instead
of
leaving
them
burning
to
attract
attention
what
was
to
prevent
the
prisoner
turning
off
the
lights
in
order
to
convey
the
impression
that
the
crime
had
been
committed
in
daylight
i
want
you
to
keep
in
mind
when
arriving
at
your
verdict
that
there
are
certain
material
facts
which
have
been
admitted
by
the
defence
said
walters
in
concluding
his
address
to
the
jury
it
has
been
admitted
that
the
prisoner
was
a
party
to
a
proposal
to
break
into
riversbrook
as
far
as
that
goes
there
is
no
suggestion
that
he
walked
into
a
trap
whether
he
arranged
the
burglary
and
compelled
hill
to
help
him
or
whether
hill
arranged
it
and
sought
out
the
prisoner
assistance
is
after
all
not
very
material
what
is
admitted
is
that
the
prisoner
went
to
riversbrook
with
the
intention
of
committing
a
crime
it
is
admitted
that
he
knew
sir
horace
fewbanks
had
returned
home
in
that
case
is
it
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
prisoner
would
arm
himself
i
do
not
say
with
the
definite
intention
of
committing
murder
but
for
the
purpose
of
threatening
sir
horace
if
necessary
in
order
to
make
good
his
escape
what
is
more
likely
than
that
sir
horace
heard
the
burglar
in
the
house
crept
upon
him
and
then
tried
to
capture
him
there
was
a
struggle
and
the
prisoner
determined
to
free
himself
drew
his
revolver
and
shot
sir
horace
is
not
such
a
theory
of
the
crime
that
sir
horace
was
shot
while
trying
to
capture
the
prisoner
more
probable
than
the
theory
of
the
defence
that
hill
the
man
you
saw
in
the
was
a
masterful
cunning
criminal
who
for
some
inexplicable
reason
had
turned
ferociously
on
the
master
who
had
befriended
him
and
given
him
a
fresh
start
in
life
had
killed
him
and
left
the
body
in
the
house
and
had
then
managed
to
direct
suspicion
to
the
prisoner
the
theory
of
the
defence
does
great
credit
to
my
learned
imagination
but
it
is
one
which
i
am
sure
the
jury
will
reject
as
too
highly
coloured
looking
at
the
plain
facts
of
the
case
and
dismissing
from
your
minds
the
attempt
to
make
them
fit
into
a
purely
imaginative
theory
i
am
sure
that
you
will
come
to
the
conclusion
that
sir
horace
fewbanks
met
his
death
at
the
hands
of
the
prisoner
the
junior
bar
agreed
that
the
case
was
one
which
might
go
either
way
if
they
had
possessed
any
money
the
betting
market
would
have
shown
scarcely
a
shade
of
odds
everything
depended
on
the
way
the
jury
looked
at
the
case
on
the
particular
bits
of
evidence
to
which
they
attached
most
weight
on
the
view
the
most
argumentative
members
of
the
jury
adopted
for
they
would
be
able
to
carry
the
others
with
them
in
the
opinion
of
the
junior
bar
the
summing
up
of
justice
hodson
would
not
help
the
jury
very
much
in
arriving
at
a
verdict
there
were
some
judges
who
summed
up
for
or
against
a
prisoner
according
to
the
view
they
had
formed
as
to
the
prisoner
guilt
or
innocence
there
were
other
judges
who
summed
up
so
impartially
and
gave
such
weight
to
the
points
against
the
prisoner
and
to
the
points
in
his
favour
as
to
make
on
the
minds
of
the
jurymen
the
impression
that
the
only
way
to
arrive
at
a
verdict
was
to
toss
a
coin
another
type
of
judge
conveyed
to
the
jury
that
the
prosecution
had
established
an
unanswerable
case
but
the
defence
had
shown
equal
skill
in
shattering
it
and
therefore
he
did
not
know
on
which
side
to
make
up
his
mind
and
fortunately
english
legal
procedure
did
not
render
it
necessary
for
him
to
do
so
the
prisoner
might
be
guilty
and
he
might
be
innocent
some
of
the
jury
might
think
one
thing
and
the
rest
of
the
jury
might
think
another
but
it
was
the
duty
of
the
jury
to
come
to
an
unanimous
verdict
it
did
not
matter
if
they
looked
at
some
things
in
different
ways
but
their
final
decision
must
be
the
same
justice
hodson
belonged
to
the
impartial
impersonal
type
of
judge
he
had
no
personal
feelings
or
conviction
as
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
prisoner
it
was
for
the
jury
to
settle
that
point
and
it
was
his
duty
to
assist
them
to
the
best
of
his
ability
he
went
over
his
notes
carefully
and
dealt
with
the
evidence
of
each
of
the
witnesses
it
was
for
the
jury
to
say
what
evidence
they
believed
and
what
they
disbelieved
there
was
a
pronounced
conflict
of
evidence
between
hill
and
fanning
they
were
the
chief
witnesses
in
the
case
but
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
prisoner
did
not
rest
entirely
upon
the
evidence
of
either
of
these
witnesses
hill
might
be
speaking
the
truth
and
the
prisoner
might
be
innocent
though
the
presumption
would
be
if
evidence
were
truthful
in
every
detail
that
the
prisoner
was
guilty
fanning
evidence
might
be
true
as
far
as
it
went
but
it
would
not
in
itself
prove
that
the
prisoner
was
innocent
hill
had
admitted
that
he
had
drawn
the
plan
of
riversbrook
to
assist
birchill
to
commit
burglary
it
was
for
the
jury
to
determine
for
themselves
whether
he
had
been
terrorised
into
drawing
the
plan
for
birchill
or
whether
he
was
the
instigator
of
the
burglary
the
defence
had
contended
that
hill
had
drawn
the
plan
at
his
leisure
at
a
time
when
he
had
access
to
a
special
quality
of
paper
supplied
to
his
master
if
that
were
so
hill
version
of
how
he
came
to
draw
the
plan
was
deliberately
false
and
had
been
concocted
for
the
purpose
of
exculpating
himself
but
they
would
not
be
justified
in
dismissing
hill
evidence
entirely
from
their
minds
because
they
were
satisfied
he
had
perjured
himself
with
regard
to
the
plan
they
would
be
justified
however
in
viewing
the
rest
of
his
evidence
with
some
degree
of
distrust
counsel
for
the
defence
had
made
an
ingenious
use
of
the
facts
that
the
body
of
the
victim
was
fully
dressed
when
discovered
and
that
none
of
the
electric
lights
in
the
house
were
burning
these
facts
lent
support
to
the
idea
that
the
murder
was
committed
in
daylight
but
they
by
no
means
established
the
theory
as
unassailable
they
did
not
establish
the
innocence
of
the
prisoner
although
to
some
extent
they
told
in
his
favour
counsel
for
the
prosecution
had
put
before
them
several
theories
to
account
for
these
two
facts
consistent
with
his
contention
that
the
murder
had
been
committed
by
the
prisoner
the
jury
must
give
full
consideration
to
these
theories
as
well
as
to
the
theory
of
the
defence
they
were
not
called
upon
to
say
which
theory
was
true
except
in
so
far
as
their
opinions
might
be
implied
in
the
verdict
they
gave
the
defence
continued
his
honour
was
that
hill
had
committed
the
murder
and
had
then
decided
to
direct
suspicion
to
the
prisoner
if
the
jury
acquitted
the
prisoner
their
verdict
would
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
endorsed
the
theory
of
the
defence
it
might
mean
that
but
it
might
mean
only
that
they
were
not
satisfied
that
the
prisoner
had
committed
the
murder
if
the
jury
were
convinced
beyond
all
reasonable
doubt
that
the
prisoner
had
committed
the
murder
they
must
bring
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
if
they
were
not
satisfied
they
must
bring
in
a
verdict
of
acquittal
the
jury
filed
out
of
their
apartment
and
as
they
retired
to
consider
their
verdict
the
judge
retired
to
his
own
room
the
prisoner
was
removed
from
the
dock
and
taken
down
the
stairs
out
of
sight
there
was
an
immediate
hum
of
voices
in
the
court
inspector
chippenfield
approached
the
table
and
whispered
to
walters
the
latter
nodded
affirmatively
and
left
the
court
room
in
company
with
holymead
the
sibilant
sound
of
whispering
voices
died
down
after
a
few
minutes
and
then
began
the
long
tedious
wait
for
the
return
of
the
jury
the
occupants
of
the
gallery
who
had
no
difficulty
in
coming
to
an
immediate
decision
on
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
prisoner
could
not
understand
what
was
keeping
the
jury
away
so
long
they
failed
to
understand
the
jury
point
of
view
these
gentlemen
had
sat
in
court
for
three
days
listening
intently
to
proceedings
concerning
a
matter
in
which
their
degree
of
personal
interest
was
only
a
form
of
curiosity
and
now
the
end
of
the
case
had
been
reached
except
for
the
climax
which
was
in
their
control
to
arrive
at
an
immediate
decision
in
a
case
that
had
occupied
the
court
for
three
days
would
indicate
they
had
no
proper
realisation
of
the
responsibilities
of
their
position
a
verdict
was
a
thing
that
had
to
be
nicely
balanced
in
relation
to
the
evidence
where
the
case
against
the
prisoner
was
weak
or
overwhelmingly
strong
the
jury
might
arrive
at
a
verdict
with
great
speed
as
an
indication
that
too
much
of
their
valuable
time
had
already
been
wasted
on
the
case
but
where
the
evidence
for
and
against
the
prisoner
was
fairly
equal
it
behoved
the
jury
to
indicate
by
the
time
they
took
in
arriving
at
their
verdict
that
they
had
given
the
case
the
most
careful
consideration
two
hours
and
twenty
minutes
after
the
jury
had
retired
the
prisoner
was
brought
back
into
the
dock
this
was
an
indication
that
the
jury
had
arrived
at
their
verdict
and
were
ready
to
deliver
it
the
prisoner
looked
worn
and
anxious
but
he
received
encouraging
smiles
from
his
friends
in
the
gallery
a
minute
later
the
judge
entered
the
court
and
resumed
his
seat
the
jury
filed
into
court
and
entered
the
amid
the
noise
of
barristers
resuming
their
seats
and
court
officials
gliding
about
the
judge
associate
called
over
the
names
of
the
jurymen
the
suspense
reached
its
climax
as
the
associate
put
the
formal
questions
to
the
foreman
whether
the
jury
had
agreed
on
their
verdict
what
say
you
guilty
or
not
guilty
asked
the
associate
in
a
hard
metallic
voice
in
which
there
was
no
trace
of
interest
in
the
answer
not
guilty
replied
the
foreman
there
was
a
muffled
cheer
from
the
gallery
which
was
suppressed
by
the
stentorian
cry
of
the
ushers
silence
in
the
court
a
pack
of
damned
fools
said
the
exasperated
inspector
chippenfield
rolfe
understood
that
his
chief
referred
to
the
jury
and
he
nodded
the
assent
of
a
subordinate
chapter
xx
hill
has
bolted
rolfe
flung
the
words
at
inspector
chippenfield
in
a
tone
which
he
was
unable
to
divest
entirely
of
satisfaction
fancy
his
being
the
guilty
party
after
all
he
added
with
the
tone
of
satisfaction
still
more
evident
in
his
voice
i
often
thought
that
he
was
our
man
and
that
he
was
playing
with
you
i
mean
with
us
inspector
chippenfield
had
betrayed
surprise
at
the
news
by
dropping
his
pen
on
the
official
report
he
was
preparing
but
it
was
in
his
usual
tone
of
cold
official
superiority
that
he
replied
do
you
mean
that
hill
the
principal
witness
in
the
riversbrook
murder
trial
has
disappeared
from
london
disappeared
from
london
he
bolted
clean
out
of
the
country
by
this
time
i
tell
you
cleared
out
for
good
and
left
his
unfortunate
wife
and
child
to
starve
how
have
you
learnt
this
rolfe
his
wife
told
me
herself
i
went
to
the
shop
this
afternoon
to
have
a
few
words
with
hill
and
see
how
he
felt
after
the
way
holymead
had
gone
for
him
at
the
trial
his
wife
burst
out
crying
when
she
saw
me
and
she
told
me
that
her
husband
had
cleared
out
last
night
after
he
came
home
from
court
the
hardened
scoundrel
took
with
him
the
few
pounds
of
her
savings
which
she
kept
in
her
bedroom
and
had
even
emptied
the
contents
of
the
till
of
the
few
shillings
and
coppers
it
contained
all
he
left
were
the
in
the
child
he
cleared
out
in
the
middle
of
the
night
after
his
wife
had
gone
to
bed
he
left
her
a
note
telling
her
she
must
get
along
without
him
i
have
the
note
here
his
wife
gave
it
to
me
rolfe
took
a
dirty
scrap
of
paper
out
of
his
and
laid
it
before
inspector
chippenfield
the
paper
was
a
half
sheet
torn
from
an
and
its
contents
were
written
in
faint
lead
pencil
they
read
dear
mary
i
have
got
to
leave
you
i
have
thought
it
out
and
this
is
the
only
thing
to
do
i
am
too
frightened
to
stay
after
what
took
place
in
the
court
i
make
a
fresh
start
in
some
place
where
i
am
not
known
and
as
soon
as
i
can
send
a
little
money
i
will
send
for
you
and
daphne
keep
your
heart
up
and
it
will
be
all
right
keep
on
the
shop
your
loving
husband
the
poor
little
woman
is
heartbroken
continued
rolfe
when
his
superior
officer
had
finished
reading
the
note
she
wants
to
know
if
we
can
not
get
her
husband
back
for
her
she
says
the
shop
wo
keep
her
and
the
child
unless
she
can
find
her
husband
she
be
turned
into
the
streets
because
she
behind
with
the
rent
and
hill
taken
every
penny
she
put
by
then
she
better
go
to
the
workhouse
retorted
inspector
chippenfield
brutally
we
have
something
to
do
if
scotland
yard
undertook
to
trace
all
the
absconding
husbands
in
london
we
can
do
nothing
in
the
matter
and
you
better
tell
her
so
inspector
chippenfield
handed
back
hill
note
as
he
spoke
rolfe
eyed
him
in
some
surprise
but
surely
you
going
to
take
out
a
warrant
for
hill
arrest
he
said
certainly
not
responded
inspector
chippenfield
impatiently
already
said
that
scotland
yard
has
something
more
to
do
than
trace
absconding
husbands
there
nothing
to
prevent
your
giving
a
little
of
your
private
time
to
looking
for
him
rolfe
if
you
feel
so
about
the
matter
but
officially
no
i
astonished
at
your
suggesting
such
a
thing
it
is
that
replied
rolfe
flushing
a
little
and
speaking
with
slight
embarrassment
but
surely
after
hill
flight
you
apply
for
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
on
the
other
ground
on
what
other
ground
asked
his
chief
coldly
why
on
a
charge
of
murdering
sir
horace
fewbanks
rolfe
burst
out
indignantly
does
this
flight
point
to
his
guilt
not
in
my
opinion
inspector
chippenfield
voice
was
purely
official
why
surely
it
does
rolfe
glance
at
his
chief
indicated
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
carrying
official
obstinacy
too
far
this
letter
he
left
behind
suggests
his
guilt
clearly
enough
i
did
notice
that
replied
inspector
chippenfield
impassively
perhaps
you
point
out
the
passage
to
me
rolfe
rolfe
hastily
produced
the
note
again
look
here
his
finger
indicated
the
place
frightened
to
stay
after
what
took
place
in
the
court
does
that
mean
clearly
enough
that
hill
realised
the
acquittal
pointed
to
him
as
the
murderer
and
he
determined
to
abscond
before
he
could
be
arrested
so
that
your
way
of
looking
at
it
eh
rolfe
said
inspector
chippenfield
quizzically
certainly
it
is
responded
rolfe
not
a
little
nettled
by
his
contemptuous
tone
it
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
that
the
jury
acquitted
birchill
because
they
believed
hill
was
guilty
holymead
made
out
too
strong
a
case
for
them
to
get
away
from
hill
lies
about
the
plan
and
the
fact
that
the
body
was
fully
dressed
when
discovered
you
a
young
man
rolfe
responded
inspector
chippenfield
in
a
tolerant
tone
but
you
have
to
shed
this
habit
of
jumping
impulsively
to
conclusions
and
generally
wrong
conclusions
if
you
want
to
succeed
in
scotland
yard
this
letter
of
hill
only
strengthens
my
previous
opinion
that
a
damned
jury
let
a
murderer
loose
on
the
world
when
they
acquitted
fred
birchill
of
the
charge
of
shooting
sir
horace
fewbanks
why
man
alive
holymead
no
more
believes
hill
is
guilty
than
i
do
he
set
himself
to
bamboozle
the
jury
and
he
succeeded
if
he
had
to
defend
hill
he
would
show
the
jury
that
hill
could
have
committed
the
murder
and
that
it
must
have
been
committed
by
birchill
and
no
one
else
he
a
clever
man
far
cleverer
than
walters
and
that
is
why
i
lost
the
case
he
led
hill
into
a
trap
about
the
plan
of
riversbrook
said
rolfe
when
i
saw
that
hill
had
been
trapped
on
that
point
i
felt
we
had
lost
the
jury
only
because
the
jury
were
a
pack
of
fools
who
knew
nothing
about
evidence
granted
that
hill
lied
about
the
plan
that
he
drew
it
up
voluntarily
in
his
spare
time
to
assist
birchill
it
proves
nothing
it
does
prove
that
hill
committed
the
murder
it
only
proves
that
hill
was
going
to
share
in
the
proceeds
of
the
burglary
that
he
was
a
willing
party
to
it
the
one
big
outstanding
fact
in
all
the
evidence
the
fact
that
towered
over
all
the
others
is
that
birchill
broke
into
the
house
on
the
night
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
murdered
the
defence
made
no
attempt
to
get
away
from
that
fact
because
they
could
not
do
so
but
holymead
vamped
up
all
sorts
of
surmises
and
suppositions
for
the
purpose
of
befogging
the
jury
and
getting
their
minds
away
from
the
outstanding
feature
of
the
case
for
the
prosecution
we
proved
that
birchill
was
in
the
house
on
a
criminal
errand
what
more
could
they
expect
us
to
prove
they
could
expect
us
to
have
a
man
looking
through
the
window
or
hiding
behind
the
door
when
the
murder
was
committed
if
we
could
get
evidence
of
that
kind
we
could
do
without
juries
we
could
hang
our
man
first
and
try
him
afterwards
i
do
think
a
verdict
of
acquittal
from
a
befogged
jury
would
do
so
much
harm
in
such
a
case
you
are
still
convinced
that
birchill
did
it
said
rolfe
questioningly
i
have
never
wavered
from
that
opinion
said
his
superior
if
i
had
this
note
of
hill
would
restore
my
conviction
in
birchill
guilt
why
how
do
you
make
out
that
replied
rolfe
blankly
hill
says
he
clearing
out
of
the
country
because
he
frightened
what
he
frightened
of
his
own
guilty
conscience
and
the
long
arm
of
the
law
not
a
bit
of
it
hill
an
innocent
man
if
he
had
been
guilty
he
never
have
stood
the
ordeal
of
the
and
the
hill
cleared
out
because
he
was
frightened
of
birchill
of
birchill
yes
did
birchill
tell
hill
just
before
he
set
out
for
riversbrook
on
the
night
of
the
murder
that
if
hill
played
him
false
he
murder
him
hill
play
him
false
not
then
but
afterwards
when
he
made
his
confession
and
birchill
was
arrested
for
the
murder
in
consequence
when
birchill
was
acquitted
at
the
trial
his
first
thought
would
be
to
wreak
vengeance
on
hill
a
man
with
one
murder
on
his
soul
would
not
be
likely
to
hesitate
about
committing
another
hill
knew
this
and
fled
to
save
his
life
when
birchill
was
acquitted
that
the
explanation
of
his
letter
rolfe
so
that
the
way
you
look
at
it
said
rolfe
of
course
i
do
it
the
only
way
hill
flight
can
be
looked
at
in
the
light
of
all
that
happened
the
theory
dovetails
in
every
part
more
used
than
you
to
putting
these
things
together
rolfe
hill
as
innocent
of
the
murder
as
you
are
and
where
do
you
think
hill
gone
to
certainly
not
out
of
london
he
too
much
of
a
cockney
for
that
besides
he
a
man
who
is
fond
of
his
wife
and
child
he
hiding
somewhere
close
at
hand
and
i
should
wonder
if
the
whole
thing
a
plant
between
him
and
his
wife
have
you
forgotten
how
she
tried
to
hoodwink
us
before
i
go
to
the
shop
and
see
if
i
frighten
the
truth
out
of
her
meanwhile
you
better
put
the
camden
town
police
on
to
watching
the
shop
if
he
hiding
in
london
he
bound
to
visit
his
wife
sooner
or
later
or
she
visit
him
so
we
ought
not
to
have
much
difficulty
in
getting
on
to
his
tracks
again
rolfe
departed
to
do
his
chief
bidding
a
little
crestfallen
he
was
at
first
inclined
to
think
that
he
had
made
a
bit
of
a
fool
of
himself
in
his
desire
to
prove
to
inspector
chippenfield
that
he
had
been
hoodwinked
by
hill
into
arresting
birchill
but
that
night
as
he
sat
in
his
bedroom
smoking
a
quiet
pipe
and
reviewing
this
latest
phase
of
the
puzzling
case
the
earlier
doubts
which
had
assailed
him
on
first
learning
of
hill
flight
recurred
to
him
with
increasing
force
if
hill
were
innocent
he
would
have
been
more
likely
to
seek
police
protection
before
flight
hill
flight
was
hardly
the
action
of
an
innocent
man
it
pointed
more
to
a
guilty
fear
of
his
own
skin
now
that
the
man
he
had
accused
of
the
murder
was
free
to
seek
vengeance
chippenfield
theory
seemed
plausible
enough
at
first
sight
but
rolfe
now
recalled
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
missing
letters
and
hill
midnight
visit
to
riversbrook
to
recover
them
rolfe
had
concealed
that
episode
from
his
superior
officer
because
he
lacked
the
courage
to
reveal
to
him
how
he
had
been
hoodwinked
by
holymead
fainting
fit
the
morning
he
was
conducting
his
official
inquiry
at
riversbrook
into
the
murder
it
an
infernally
baffling
case
muttered
rolfe
refilling
his
pipe
from
a
tin
of
tobacco
on
the
mantelpiece
and
walking
up
and
down
the
cheap
drugget
with
rapid
strides
if
birchill
is
not
the
murderer
who
is
is
it
hill
he
lit
his
pipe
closed
the
window
opened
his
and
sat
down
to
peruse
the
notes
he
had
taken
during
his
investigation
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
murder
he
read
and
them
earnestly
searching
for
a
fresh
clue
in
the
pencilled
pages
after
spending
some
time
in
this
occupation
he
took
a
clean
sheet
of
paper
and
a
pencil
and
copied
afresh
the
following
entries
from
his
notebook
august

night

hurried
hill
off
when
he
returned
from
scotland
mem
inadvisable
disclose
this
to
underneath
his
entries
of
the
case
rolfe
had
written
finally
points
to
be
remembered
crewe
said
before
the
trial
that
birchill
was
not
the
murderer
and
would
be
acquitted
birchill
was
acquitted
crewe
suggested
we
had
not
got
the
whole
truth
out
of
hill
hill
disappears
the
night
after
the
trial
is
hill
the
murderer
the
handkerchief
and
the
letters
point
to
a
woman
in
the
case
although
this
was
not
brought
out
at
the
trial
is
it
possible
that
woman
is
rolfe
realised
that
the
chief
pieces
of
the
puzzle
were
before
him
but
the
difficulty
was
to
put
them
together
he
felt
sure
there
was
a
connection
between
these
facts
which
if
brought
to
light
would
solve
the
riversbrook
mystery
without
knowing
it
he
had
been
so
influenced
by
crewe
analysis
of
the
case
that
he
had
practically
given
up
the
idea
that
birchill
had
anything
to
do
with
the
murder
his
real
reason
for
going
to
hill
shop
that
morning
was
to
try
and
extract
something
from
hill
which
might
put
him
on
the
track
of
the
actual
murderer
he
believed
hill
knew
more
than
he
had
divulged
hill
before
his
disappearance
had
placed
in
his
hands
an
important
clue
if
he
only
knew
how
to
follow
it
up
that
incident
of
the
missing
letters
must
have
some
bearing
on
the
case
if
he
could
only
elucidate
it
should
he
disclose
to
chippenfield
hill
story
of
the
missing
letters
rolfe
dismissed
the
idea
as
soon
as
it
crossed
his
mind
he
knew
his
superior
officer
sufficiently
well
to
understand
that
he
would
be
very
angry
to
learn
that
he
had
been
deceived
by
holymead
and
as
she
was
outside
the
range
of
his
anger
he
would
bear
a
grudge
against
his
junior
officer
for
discovering
the
deception
which
had
been
practised
on
him
and
do
all
he
could
to
block
his
promotion
in
scotland
yard
in
consequence
apart
from
that
he
could
offer
chippenfield
no
excuse
for
not
having
told
him
before
should
he
consult
crewe
rolfe
dismissed
that
thought
also
but
more
reluctantly
hang
it
all
it
was
too
humiliating
for
an
accredited
officer
of
scotland
yard
to
consult
a
private
detective
rolfe
had
acquired
an
unwilling
respect
for
abilities
during
the
course
of
the
investigations
into
the
riversbrook
case
but
he
retained
all
the
intolerance
which
regular
members
of
the
detective
force
feel
for
the
private
detectives
who
poach
on
their
preserves
rolfe
professional
jealousy
was
intensified
in
crewe
case
because
of
the
brilliant
successes
crewe
had
achieved
during
his
career
at
the
expense
of
the
reputation
of
scotland
yard
rolfe
had
an
instinctive
feeling
that
crewe
mind
was
of
finer
quality
than
his
own
and
would
see
light
where
he
only
groped
in
darkness
if
crewe
had
been
his
superior
officer
in
scotland
yard
rolfe
would
have
gone
to
him
unhesitatingly
and
profited
by
his
keener
vision
but
he
could
not
do
so
in
their
existing
relative
positions
he
ransacked
his
brain
for
some
other
course
after
long
consideration
rolfe
decided
to
go
and
see
holymead
and
question
her
about
the
packet
of
letters
which
hill
declared
she
had
removed
from
riversbrook
after
the
murder
he
realised
that
this
was
rather
a
risky
course
to
pursue
for
holymead
was
highly
placed
and
could
do
him
much
harm
if
she
got
her
husband
to
use
his
influence
at
the
home
office
for
then
he
would
have
to
admit
that
he
had
gone
to
her
without
the
knowledge
of
his
superior
officer
on
the
statement
of
a
discredited
servant
who
had
arranged
a
burglary
in
his
master
house
the
night
he
was
murdered
nevertheless
rolfe
decided
to
take
the
risk
the
chance
of
getting
somewhere
nearer
the
solution
of
the
riversbrook
mystery
was
worth
it
and
what
a
feather
in
his
cap
it
would
be
if
he
solved
the
mystery
he
was
convinced
that
chippenfield
had
shut
out
important
light
on
the
mystery
by
doggedly
insisting
in
order
to
buttress
up
his
case
against
birchill
that
the
piece
of
handkerchief
which
had
been
found
in
the
dead
man
hand
was
a
portion
of
a
handkerchief
which
had
belonged
to
the
girl
fanning
and
had
been
brought
by
birchill
from
the
westminster
flat
on
the
night
of
the
murder
it
was
more
likely
in
view
of
hill
story
of
the
letters
that
the
handkerchief
belonged
to
holymead
rolfe
had
not
made
up
his
mind
that
holymead
had
committed
the
murder
but
he
was
convinced
that
she
and
her
letters
had
some
connection
with
the
baffling
crime
and
he
determined
to
try
and
pierce
the
mystery
by
questioning
her
having
arrived
at
this
decision
he
replaced
his
notebook
in
his
coat
pocket
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
and
went
to
bed
chapter
xxi
rolfe
went
to
hyde
park
next
day
and
walked
from
the
tube
station
to
holymead
house
at
princes
gate
the
servant
who
answered
his
ring
informed
him
in
reply
to
his
question
that
holymead
was
not
at
home
do
you
know
when
she
will
be
home
persisted
rolfe
forestalling
an
evident
desire
on
the
servant
part
to
shut
the
door
in
his
face
the
man
looked
at
rolfe
doubtfully
english
servant
though
he
was
and
used
to
summing
up
strangers
at
a
glance
he
could
not
quite
make
out
who
rolfe
might
be
but
before
he
could
come
to
a
decision
on
the
point
a
feminine
voice
behind
him
said
what
is
it
trappon
the
servant
turned
quickly
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
it
a
er
er
party
who
wants
to
see
madam
mademoiselle
he
replied
what
mean
you
by
explain
yourself
trappon
a
person
a
gentleman
mademoiselle
replied
trappon
determined
to
be
on
the
safe
side
open
the
door
trappon
that
i
may
see
this
gentleman
trappon
somewhat
reluctantly
complied
and
a
young
lady
stepped
forward
she
was
tall
and
dark
with
charming
eyes
which
were
also
shrewd
she
had
a
fine
figure
which
a
dress
displayed
rather
too
boldly
for
good
taste
and
she
was
sufficiently
young
to
be
able
to
appear
quite
girlish
in
the
half
light
you
wish
to
see
madame
holymead
she
said
to
rolfe
her
manner
was
engagingly
pleasant
and
french
rolfe
felt
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
be
gallant
in
the
presence
of
the
fair
representative
of
a
nation
whom
he
vaguely
understood
placed
gallantry
in
the
forefront
of
the
virtues
he
took
off
his
hat
with
a
courtly
bow
i
do
mademoiselle
he
replied
and
my
business
is
important
then
monsieur
step
inside
if
you
will
be
so
good
and
i
will
see
you
she
led
rolfe
to
a
small
room
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
carefully
shut
the
door
then
she
invited
rolfe
to
be
seated
and
asked
him
to
state
his
business
but
this
was
precisely
what
rolfe
was
not
anxious
to
do
except
to
holymead
herself
my
business
is
private
and
must
be
placed
before
holymead
he
said
firmly
i
wish
to
see
her
i
regret
monsieur
but
madame
holymead
is
out
of
town
she
went
last
week
if
you
had
only
come
before
she
went
mademoiselle
chiron
looked
genuinely
sorry
rolfe
was
a
little
taken
aback
at
this
intelligence
and
showed
it
out
of
town
he
repeated
where
has
she
gone
to
she
looked
at
him
almost
timidly
but
monsieur
i
do
not
know
if
i
ought
to
tell
you
without
knowing
who
you
are
are
you
a
friend
of
madame
my
name
is
detective
rolfe
i
come
from
scotland
yard
replied
rolfe
in
the
authoritative
tone
of
a
man
who
knew
that
the
disclosure
was
sure
to
command
respect
if
not
a
welcome
scotland
you
come
from
scotland
madame
will
regret
much
that
she
has
missed
you
scotland
yard
i
said
corrected
rolfe
not
scotland
is
it
not
the
same
mademoiselle
chiron
looked
at
him
helplessly
scotland
yard
is
it
not
in
scotland
what
is
the
difference
rolfe
with
a
londoner
tolerance
for
foreign
ignorance
painstakingly
explained
the
difference
she
looked
so
puzzled
that
he
felt
sure
she
did
not
understand
him
but
that
he
reflected
was
not
his
fault
so
you
see
mademoiselle
my
business
with
holymead
is
important
therefore
i
be
obliged
if
you
will
tell
me
where
i
can
find
her
he
said
in
what
part
of
the
country
is
she
mademoiselle
chiron
looked
distressed
really
monsieur
i
can
not
tell
you
she
is
motoring
and
i
should
have
been
with
her
but
that
i
have
gros
rhume
she
produced
a
tiny
scrap
of
lace
handkerchief
and
held
it
to
her
nose
as
though
in
support
of
her
statement
and
she
rings
me
on
the
telephone
from
different
places
and
tells
me
the
things
she
does
need
and
i
do
send
them
on
to
her
where
does
she
ring
you
up
from
asked
rolfe
eyeing
mademoiselle
chiron
handkerchief
intently
from
brighton
from
eastbourne
wherever
she
stops
what
place
was
she
stopping
at
when
you
heard
from
her
last
eastbourne
monsieur
and
when
will
she
return
here
that
monsieur
i
do
not
know
next
week
she
does
not
tell
me
if
monsieur
will
leave
me
a
message
i
will
see
that
she
gets
it
for
it
is
always
me
she
wants
and
it
is
always
me
that
talks
to
her
what
shall
i
tell
her
when
next
she
rings
the
telephone
if
monsieur
will
state
his
business
i
will
tell
madame
what
he
tells
me
i
am
cousin
by
marriage
in
me
she
has
confidence
she
spoke
in
a
tone
which
invited
confidence
but
rolfe
was
not
prepared
to
go
to
the
length
of
trusting
the
young
woman
he
saw
before
him
despite
her
assurance
that
she
was
in
the
confidence
of
holymead
he
rose
to
his
feet
with
a
keen
glance
at
mademoiselle
handkerchief
which
she
had
rolled
into
a
little
ball
in
her
hand
i
can
not
disclose
my
business
to
you
mademoiselle
he
said
courteously
i
must
see
holymead
personally
so
i
shall
call
again
when
she
has
returned
but
monsieur
why
will
you
not
tell
me
she
asked
coaxingly
you
are
a
police
agent
have
you
therefore
come
to
see
madame
about
the
case
rolfe
showed
that
he
was
taken
aback
by
the
direct
question
the
case
he
stammered
what
case
why
monsieur
what
case
should
it
be
but
that
of
which
i
have
so
often
heard
madame
speak
le
judge
the
good
friend
of
monsieur
and
madame
holymead
who
was
killed
by
the
base
assassin
madame
is
disconsolate
about
his
terrible
end
mademoiselle
chiron
here
applied
the
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
on
her
own
account
have
you
come
to
tell
her
that
you
have
caught
the
wicked
man
who
did
assassinate
him
madame
will
be
overjoyed
why
hardly
that
replied
rolfe
completely
off
his
guard
but
on
the
track
mademoiselle
we
on
the
track
and
is
it
that
you
wanted
me
to
tell
madame
persisted
mademoiselle
chiron
i
wanted
to
ask
her
a
question
or
two
about
several
things
said
rolfe
who
had
determined
to
disclose
his
hand
sufficiently
to
bring
holymead
back
to
london
if
she
had
anything
to
do
with
the
crime
i
want
to
ask
her
about
some
letters
that
were
stolen
no
i
wo
say
stolen
letters
that
were
removed
from
riversbrook
i
have
been
informed
that
even
if
these
letters
are
no
longer
in
existence
she
can
give
the
police
a
good
idea
of
what
was
in
them
the
telephone
bell
in
the
corner
of
the
room
rang
suddenly
mademoiselle
chiron
ran
to
answer
it
and
accidentally
dropped
her
handkerchief
on
the
floor
in
picking
up
the
receiver
mademoiselle
chiron
began
speaking
on
the
telephone
but
she
stopped
suddenly
staring
with
frightened
eyes
into
the
mirror
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
the
glass
reflected
the
actions
of
rolfe
at
the
table
seated
with
his
back
towards
her
he
had
taken
advantage
of
her
being
called
to
the
telephone
to
examine
her
handkerchief
which
he
had
picked
up
from
the
floor
he
had
produced
from
his
pocketbook
the
scrap
of
lace
and
muslin
which
he
had
found
in
the
murdered
man
hand
he
had
the
two
on
the
table
side
by
side
comparing
them
and
mademoiselle
chiron
noticed
a
smile
of
satisfaction
flit
across
his
face
as
he
did
so
while
she
looked
he
restored
the
scrap
to
his
and
the
to
his
pocket
hastily
she
turned
to
the
telephone
again
and
continued
in
a
voice
which
a
quick
ear
would
have
detected
was
slightly
hysterical
then
she
hung
up
the
receiver
and
turned
to
rolfe
but
monsieur
you
were
saying
rolfe
handed
the
handkerchief
to
its
owner
with
a
courtly
bow
which
he
flattered
himself
was
equal
to
the
best
french
school
i
picked
this
up
off
the
floor
mademoiselle
it
is
yours
i
think
this
mademoiselle
chiron
touched
the
handkerchief
with
a
dainty
forefinger
it
is
my
handkerchief
i
dropped
it
it
is
very
pretty
said
rolfe
with
simulated
indifference
i
suppose
you
bought
that
in
paris
it
does
not
look
english
but
no
monsieur
it
is
quite
engleesh
i
bought
it
in
the
shop
indeed
a
london
shop
inquired
rolfe
with
equal
indifference
the
shop
in
oxford
street
what
do
you
call
it
hobson
i
sure
i
do
know
these
ladies
things
are
a
bit
out
of
my
line
said
rolfe
rising
as
he
spoke
with
a
smile
in
which
there
was
more
than
a
trace
of
he
felt
that
he
had
acquitted
himself
with
an
adroitness
which
crewe
himself
might
have
envied
he
had
made
an
important
discovery
and
extracted
the
name
of
the
shop
where
the
handkerchief
had
been
bought
without
so
he
flattered
himself
arousing
any
suspicions
on
the
part
of
the
lady
rolfe
knew
from
his
inquiries
in
west
end
shops
that
handkerchiefs
of
that
pattern
and
quality
were
stocked
by
many
of
the
good
shops
but
the
fact
that
he
had
found
a
handkerchief
of
this
kind
in
the
house
of
a
lady
who
had
abstracted
secret
letters
from
the
murdered
man
desk
and
had
moreover
discovered
the
name
of
the
shop
where
she
bought
her
handkerchiefs
convinced
him
that
he
had
struck
a
path
which
must
lead
to
an
important
discovery
mademoiselle
chiron
followed
rolfe
into
the
hall
and
watched
his
departure
from
a
front
window
when
she
saw
his
retreating
figure
turn
the
corner
of
the
street
she
left
the
window
ran
upstairs
quickly
and
knocked
lightly
at
the
closed
door
the
door
was
opened
by
holymead
who
appeared
to
be
in
a
state
of
nervous
agitation
her
large
brown
eyes
were
swollen
and
dim
with
weeping
her
hair
had
become
partly
unloosened
her
face
was
white
and
her
dress
disordered
she
caught
the
frenchwoman
by
the
wrist
and
drew
her
into
the
bedroom
closing
the
door
after
her
what
did
he
want
gabrielle
she
gasped
what
did
he
say
has
he
come
about
gabrielle
nodded
her
head
gabrielle
holymead
voice
rose
almost
to
a
cry
oh
what
are
we
to
do
did
he
come
to
arrest
no
no
he
was
not
so
bad
he
did
not
come
to
do
dreadful
things
but
just
to
have
a
little
talk
a
little
talk
what
about
he
wanted
to
see
you
and
ask
you
one
or
two
little
questions
i
put
him
off
he
was
like
wax
in
my
hands
pouf
he
has
gone
so
why
trouble
but
he
will
come
again
he
is
sure
to
come
again
no
doubt
he
says
he
will
come
again
in
a
week
when
you
return
holymead
wrung
her
hands
helplessly
what
are
we
to
do
then
she
wailed
we
will
look
the
tragedy
in
the
face
when
it
comes
foi
what
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
for
nothing
is
it
worth
to
look
like
with
deft
and
loving
fingers
gabrielle
began
to
arrange
hair
we
will
have
everything
right
before
this
little
police
agent
returns
we
will
show
him
he
is
the
complete
fool
for
suspecting
you
know
about
the
murder
but
what
can
you
do
gabrielle
asked
holymead
she
looked
at
gabrielle
with
her
large
brown
eyes
as
though
she
were
utterly
dependent
on
the
other
stronger
will
for
support
and
assistance
mademoiselle
chiron
stopped
in
her
arrangement
of
holymead
hair
and
bending
over
kissed
her
affectionately
she
said
do
not
worry
i
have
thought
of
a
plan
oh
a
most
excellent
plan
which
i
will
myself
execute
and
then
shall
all
your
troubles
be
finished
and
you
will
be
happy
again
chapter
xxii

by
the
way
she
speaks

arskt
her
if
she
had
an
appointment
and
she
said
no
but
she
said
she
wanted
to
see
you
on
very
urgent
and
particular
business
i
told
her
most
people
says
that
wot
comes
to
see
you
but
she
says
hers
was
important
arskt
me
to
tell
you
sir
that
it
was
about
the
riversbrook
case
the
riversbrook
case
i
see
her
joe
has
not
stork
returned
yet
no
sir
tell
him
to
go
to
his
dinner
when
he
comes
back
show
the
lady
in
joe
crewe
regarded
his
caller
keenly
as
joe
ushered
her
in
placed
a
chair
for
her
and
went
out
closing
the
door
noiselessly
behind
him
she
was
a
tall
graceful
woman
fairly
young
with
dark
hair
and
eyes
she
looked
quickly
at
the
detective
as
she
entered
and
crewe
was
struck
by
the
shrewd
penetration
of
her
glance
you
are
monsieur
crewe
the
great
detective
is
it
not
so
she
asked
as
she
sat
down
the
glance
she
now
gave
the
detective
at
closer
range
from
her
large
dark
eyes
was
innocent
and
ingenuous
with
a
touch
of
admiration
the
contrast
between
it
and
her
former
look
was
not
lost
on
crewe
and
he
realised
that
his
visitor
was
no
ordinary
woman
my
name
is
crewe
he
said
ignoring
the
compliment
what
do
you
wish
to
see
me
for
the
visitor
did
not
immediately
reply
she
nervously
unfastened
a
bag
she
carried
and
taking
out
a
singularly
handkerchief
a
large
cambric
square
almost
masculine
in
its
proportions
and
guiltless
of
lace
or
perfume
held
it
to
her
face
for
a
moment
but
crewe
noticed
that
her
eyes
were
dry
when
she
removed
it
to
remark
what
i
say
to
you
monsieur
is
in
strictest
confidence
as
sacred
as
the
confession
anything
you
say
to
me
will
be
in
strict
confidence
said
crewe
a
little
grimly
and
the
boy
can
he
not
hear
through
the
keyhole
crewe
visitor
glanced
expressively
at
the
door
by
which
she
had
entered
you
are
quite
safe
here
madame
mademoiselle
i
should
say
he
added
with
a
quick
glance
at
her
left
hand
from
which
she
slowly
removed
the
glove
as
she
spoke
mademoiselle
chiron
monsieur
said
gabrielle
flashing
another
smile
at
him
i
am
madame
holymead
relative
her
cousin
i
come
to
see
you
about
the
dreadful
murder
of
the
judge
madame
friend
you
come
from
mrs
holymead
said
crewe
quickly
then
mademoiselle
chiron
before
no
no
monsieur
no
her
agitation
was
unmistakably
genuine
i
do
not
come
madame
holymead
i
am
her
relative
it
is
true
but
i
come
how
shall
i
say
it
from
myself
i
mean
she
does
not
know
of
my
visit
to
you
monsieur
i
quite
understand
replied
crewe
monsieur
crewe
said
gabrielle
hurriedly
although
i
have
not
come
from
madame
holymead
it
is
for
her
sake
that
i
come
to
see
you
to
save
her
from
the
persecution
of
one
of
your
police
agents
who
wants
to
ask
her
questions
about
this
so
sordid
so
terrible
a
crime
he
has
come
once
this
agent
last
night
he
came
and
he
told
me
he
wanted
to
question
madame
holymead
about
the
murder
of
her
dear
friend
the
judge
i
do
not
want
madame
worried
with
these
questions
so
i
told
him
madame
was
away
in
the
motor
in
the
country
but
he
says
he
will
come
again
and
again
till
he
sees
her
madame
is
distracted
when
she
learns
of
his
visit
it
opens
up
her
bleeding
heart
afresh
for
she
and
her
husband
were
with
the
dead
judge
and
deeply
terribly
they
deplore
his
so
dreadful
end
i
see
madame
cry
and
i
say
to
myself
i
will
not
let
this
little
police
agent
spoil
her
beauty
and
give
her
the
migraine
his
visits
must
be
shall
be
prevented
i
have
heard
of
the
so
great
and
good
monsieur
crewe
and
i
will
go
and
see
him
we
will
as
you
say
in
your
english
way
put
our
heads
together
this
famous
detective
and
i
and
we
will
find
some
way
of
how
do
you
call
it
circumventing
this
police
agent
so
that
my
dear
madame
shall
cry
no
more
monsieur
crewe
i
am
here
and
i
beg
of
you
to
help
me
crewe
listened
to
this
outburst
with
inward
surprise
but
impassive
features
apparently
the
police
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
had
blundered
in
arresting
birchill
for
the
murder
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
and
had
recommenced
inquiries
with
a
view
to
bringing
the
crime
home
to
somebody
else
he
did
not
know
whether
their
suspicions
were
now
directed
against
holymead
but
they
had
conducted
their
preliminary
inquiries
so
clumsily
as
to
arouse
her
fears
that
they
did
so
much
was
apparent
from
mademoiselle
chiron
remarks
despite
the
interpretation
she
sought
to
place
on
holymead
fears
he
wondered
if
the
police
agent
was
rolfe
or
chippenfield
it
was
obvious
that
the
cool
proposal
that
he
should
help
to
shield
holymead
against
unwelcome
police
attentions
covered
some
deeper
move
and
he
shaped
his
conversation
in
the
endeavour
to
extract
more
from
the
frenchwoman
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
that
holymead
has
been
subjected
to
this
annoyance
he
said
warily
this
police
agent
did
he
come
by
himself
but
yes
monsieur
i
have
already
said
it
i
know
but
i
thought
he
might
have
had
a
companion
waiting
for
him
in
a
outside
scotland
yard
men
frequently
travel
in
pairs
he
had
no
declared
mademoiselle
chiron
positively
he
walked
away
on
foot
by
himself
i
watched
him
from
the
window
crewe
registered
a
mental
note
of
this
admission
if
she
had
watched
the
detective
departure
from
the
window
she
evidently
had
some
reason
for
wanting
to
see
the
last
of
him
aloud
he
said
i
expect
i
know
him
what
was
he
like
tall
as
tall
as
you
only
bigger
much
bigger
and
he
had
the
great
moustache
which
he
caressed
again
and
again
with
his
fingers
gabrielle
daintily
imitated
the
action
on
her
own
short
upper
lip
i
know
him
declared
crewe
with
a
smile
his
name
is
rolfe
there
should
be
nothing
about
him
to
alarm
you
mademoiselle
why
he
is
quite
a
ladies
man
gabrielle
shrugged
her
shoulders
disdainfully
that
may
be
she
replied
but
i
like
him
not
and
i
do
not
wish
him
to
worry
madame
holymead
but
why
not
let
him
see
mrs
holymead
suggested
crewe
after
a
short
pause
as
he
only
wants
to
ask
her
a
few
short
questions
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
the
quickest
way
out
of
the
difficulty
and
would
save
you
all
the
trouble
and
worry
you
speak
of
i
tell
you
i
will
not
declared
gabrielle
vehemently
i
will
not
have
madame
holymead
worried
and
made
ill
with
the
terrible
ordeal
bah
what
do
you
men
so
clumsy
know
of
the
delicate
feelings
of
a
lady
like
madame
holymead
the
least
soupçon
of
excitement
and
she
is
disturbed
distraite
for
days
after
last
night
after
the
visit
of
the
police
agent
she
was
quite
hysterical
why
should
she
be
when
she
had
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
rejoined
crewe
he
spoke
in
a
tone
of
simple
wonder
but
gabrielle
shot
a
quick
glance
at
him
from
under
her
veiled
lashes
as
she
replied
bah
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
i
repeat
monsieur
crewe
you
men
can
not
understand
the
feelings
of
a
lady
like
madame
holymead
in
a
matter
like
this
she
and
her
husband
were
as
i
have
said
before
with
the
great
judge
they
visited
his
house
they
dined
with
him
they
met
him
in
society
behold
he
is
brutally
horribly
killed
madame
when
she
hears
the
terrible
news
is
ill
for
days
she
can
not
eat
she
can
not
sleep
she
can
interest
herself
in
nothing
she
is
forgetting
a
little
when
the
police
agents
they
catch
a
man
and
say
he
is
the
murderer
then
comes
the
trial
of
this
man
at
the
court
with
so
queer
a
name
old
bailee
the
papers
are
full
of
the
terrible
story
again
of
the
dead
man
how
he
looked
killed
how
he
lay
in
a
pool
of
blood
how
they
cut
him
open
madame
holymead
can
not
pick
up
a
paper
without
seeing
these
things
and
she
falls
ill
again
then
the
jury
say
the
man
the
police
agents
caught
is
not
the
murderer
he
goes
free
and
once
more
the
talk
dies
away
madame
holymead
once
more
begins
to
forget
when
this
police
agent
comes
to
her
house
to
remind
her
once
more
all
about
it
it
is
too
cruel
monsieur
it
is
too
cruel
gabrielle
voice
vibrated
with
indignation
as
she
concluded
and
crewe
regarded
her
closely
he
decided
that
her
affection
for
holymead
was
not
simulated
and
that
it
would
be
best
to
handle
her
from
that
point
of
view
i
am
sorry
he
said
coldly
but
i
do
not
see
how
i
can
help
you
monsieur
said
the
frenchwoman
clasping
her
hands
i
entreat
you
not
to
say
so
it
would
be
so
easy
for
you
to
help
not
me
but
madame
how
you
know
this
police
agent
you
also
are
a
police
agent
though
so
much
greater
therefore
you
whisper
just
one
little
word
in
the
ear
of
your
friend
the
police
agent
and
he
will
not
bother
madame
holymead
again
i
think
you
could
do
this
and
if
you
need
money
to
give
to
the
police
agent
why
i
have
brought
some
she
fumbled
nervously
at
her
stay
said
crewe
what
you
ask
is
impossible
i
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
scotland
yard
i
could
not
interfere
in
their
inquiries
even
if
i
wished
to
they
would
only
laugh
at
me
gabrielle
dark
eyes
showed
her
disappointment
but
she
made
one
more
effort
to
gain
her
end
she
leant
nearer
to
crewe
and
laid
a
persuasive
hand
on
his
arm
if
you
would
only
make
the
effort
she
said
coaxingly
my
beautiful
madame
holymead
would
be
for
ever
grateful
mademoiselle
once
more
i
repeat
that
what
you
ask
is
impossible
returned
crewe
decisively
i
repeat
i
can
not
see
why
holymead
should
object
to
answering
a
few
questions
the
police
wish
to
ask
her
she
is
too
sensitive
about
such
a
trifle
gabrielle
shrugged
her
shoulders
slightly
in
tacit
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
man
in
front
of
her
was
too
shrewd
to
be
deceived
by
subterfuge
there
is
another
reason
monsieur
she
whispered
you
had
better
tell
it
to
me
if
you
had
been
a
woman
you
would
have
guessed
the
great
judge
who
was
killed
was
in
his
spare
moments
what
you
call
a
gallant
he
did
love
my
sex
in
france
this
would
not
matter
but
in
england
they
think
much
of
it
so
very
much
madame
holymead
is
frightened
for
fear
the
least
breath
of
scandal
should
attach
to
her
name
if
the
world
knew
that
the
police
agent
had
visited
her
house
on
such
an
errand
madame
is
innocent
it
is
not
necessary
to
assure
you
of
that
but
the
prudish
dames
of
england
are
censorious
the
scotland
yard
people
are
not
likely
to
disclose
anything
about
it
said
crewe
that
may
be
so
but
these
things
come
out
retorted
gabrielle
monsieur
she
added
after
a
pause
and
speaking
in
a
low
tone
i
know
that
you
can
do
much
very
much
if
you
will
and
can
stop
madame
holymead
from
being
worried
would
you
do
so
if
you
were
told
who
the
murderer
was
i
mean
he
who
did
really
kill
the
great
judge
crewe
was
genuinely
surprised
but
his
control
over
his
features
was
so
complete
that
he
did
not
betray
it
do
you
know
who
sir
horace
murderer
is
he
asked
in
quiet
even
tones
monsieur
i
do
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
story
in
secret
how
do
you
say
in
confidence
if
you
promise
me
you
will
help
madame
holymead
as
i
have
asked
you
i
can
not
enter
into
a
bargain
like
that
rejoined
crewe
i
do
not
know
whether
holymead
may
not
be
implicated
concerned
in
what
you
say
monsieur
she
is
not
flashed
gabrielle
indignantly
she
knows
nothing
about
it
what
i
have
to
tell
you
concerns
myself
alone
in
that
case
rejoined
crewe
i
think
you
had
better
speak
to
me
frankly
and
freely
and
if
i
can
i
will
help
you
you
are
perhaps
right
she
replied
i
will
tell
you
everything
provided
you
give
me
your
word
of
honour
that
you
will
not
inform
the
police
of
what
i
will
tell
you
if
you
bind
me
to
that
promise
i
do
not
see
how
i
can
help
you
in
the
direction
you
indicate
said
crewe
after
a
moment
thought
if
the
police
are
asked
to
abandon
their
inquiries
about
holymead
they
will
naturally
wish
to
know
the
reason
you
are
quite
right
said
gabrielle
i
did
not
think
of
that
but
if
i
tell
you
everything
and
you
have
to
tell
the
police
agents
so
as
to
help
madame
will
you
promise
that
the
police
agents
do
not
come
and
arrest
provided
you
have
not
committed
murder
or
been
in
any
way
accessory
to
it
i
think
i
can
promise
you
that
rejoined
crewe
monsieur
i
do
not
understand
you
but
i
can
almost
divine
your
meaning
your
promise
is
what
you
call
a
guarded
one
nevertheless
i
like
your
face
and
i
will
trust
you
gabrielle
relapsed
into
silence
for
some
moments
looking
at
crewe
earnestly
monsieur
she
said
at
length
it
is
a
terrible
story
i
have
to
relate
and
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
tell
a
stranger
what
i
know
nevertheless
i
will
begin
i
knew
the
great
judge
well
you
knew
sir
horace
fewbanks
exclaimed
crewe
he
was
my
lover
monsieur
she
brought
the
last
two
words
out
defiantly
with
a
quick
glance
at
crewe
to
see
how
he
took
the
avowal
she
seemed
to
find
something
reassuring
in
his
answering
glance
and
she
continued
in
more
even
tones
i
had
often
seen
him
at
the
house
of
madame
holymead
when
i
came
to
london
to
visit
her
i
admired
sir
horace
when
i
saw
him
often
he
used
to
call
and
dine
for
he
was
the
friend
of
monsieur
holymead
but
madame
told
me
that
the
great
judge
was
what
in
england
you
call
a
lover
of
the
ladies
that
he
was
dangerous
so
i
must
be
careful
of
him
i
used
to
look
at
him
when
he
called
and
thought
he
was
handsome
in
the
english
way
and
sometimes
he
looked
at
me
when
he
was
unobserved
and
smiled
at
me
but
madame
did
not
like
me
looking
at
him
she
said
i
was
foolish
she
warned
me
to
be
careful
gabrielle
shrugged
her
shoulders
expressively
of
what
use
was
madame
warning
it
did
but
make
me
wish
to
know
more
of
this
great
lover
of
my
sex
he
saw
that
and
made
the
opportunity
and
made
love
to
me
he
was
so
ardent
so
fervid
a
lover
that
i
was
conquered
after
we
had
been
lovers
i
told
him
my
secret
that
i
was
married
pierre
simon
my
husband
was
a
bad
man
and
so
i
left
him
but
madame
must
not
know
that
i
was
married
for
that
is
my
secret
it
does
not
do
to
tell
everything
besides
it
would
have
distressed
her
monsieur
i
was
happy
with
my
lover
the
great
judge
he
was
charming
he
had
that
charm
of
manner
which
you
english
lack
faithful
i
do
not
know
often
we
were
together
and
often
we
wrote
letters
when
to
meet
was
impossible
he
kept
my
letters
they
amused
him
so
he
said
they
were
so
french
so
piquant
so
different
to
english
ladies
letters
alas
monsieur
there
had
been
others
many
others
there
must
have
been
for
he
understood
my
sex
so
well
one
afternoon
i
was
out
for
a
walk
looking
in
the
great
shops
in
regent
street
when
i
felt
a
hand
placed
on
my
shoulder
and
looking
round
i
saw
pierre
my
husband
he
was
pleased
at
the
meeting
but
i
was
not
pleased
he
took
me
to
a
café
where
we
could
talk
it
was
what
he
always
did
talk
about
money
money
money
he
always
wanted
money
he
said
i
must
find
him
some
and
when
i
told
him
i
had
none
he
said
i
must
find
some
way
of
getting
it
or
he
would
come
to
the
house
and
expose
my
secret
i
walked
away
out
of
the
café
and
left
him
there
but
i
soon
saw
him
again
and
again
he
followed
me
and
talked
to
me
against
my
will
monsieur
i
was
very
much
distressed
and
for
a
long
time
i
tried
to
think
of
a
way
to
get
rid
of
pierre
for
i
was
afraid
that
he
would
come
to
the
house
and
tell
madame
holymead
i
was
married
then
i
thought
of
the
great
judge
my
lover
he
would
know
how
to
send
pierre
away
for
pierre
would
be
frightened
of
him
but
sir
horace
was
in
scotland
shooting
the
poor
birds
but
i
wrote
to
him
and
asked
him
for
my
sake
to
come
at
once
because
i
was
in
distress
and
needed
help
monsieur
he
came
but
he
came
to
his
death
he
sent
me
a
letter
to
meet
him
at
riversbrook
at
ten
he
was
sorry
it
was
so
late
but
he
thought
it
would
be
safer
not
to
come
to
the
house
till
after
dark
in
the
long
summer
evening
for
people
were
so
censorious
i
was
to
tell
madame
holymead
that
i
was
going
to
the
theatre
with
a
friend
i
was
so
pleased
to
think
that
i
would
get
rid
of
pierre
that
on
the
morning
when
he
stopped
me
to
ask
me
again
about
the
money
i
showed
him
the
letter
of
the
great
judge
and
told
him
i
would
make
the
judge
put
him
in
prison
if
he
did
not
go
away
and
leave
me
alone
is
your
lover
said
pierre
will
kill
him
but
i
laughed
for
i
knew
pierre
did
not
care
if
i
had
many
lovers
i
said
to
him
you
would
extort
the
money
blackmail
the
english
call
it
do
they
not
monsieur
crewe
you
would
not
kill
sir
horace
is
not
afraid
of
you
if
you
go
near
him
he
would
have
you
taken
off
to
gaol
but
pierre
he
was
deep
in
thought
several
times
he
said
want
money
each
time
i
said
to
him
you
must
work
for
it
is
no
way
to
get
money
he
answered
great
judge
he
has
much
money
is
it
not
so
i
left
him
monsieur
thinking
of
money
but
i
did
not
know
how
bad
his
thoughts
were
i
returned
home
and
i
told
madame
holymead
i
would
go
to
the
theatre
that
night
i
left
the
house
at
eight
and
after
walking
along
piccadilly
and
regent
street
took
the
train
to
hampstead
then
i
walked
up
to
the
house
of
sir
horace
so
as
not
to
be
too
early
the
gate
was
open
and
i
thought
that
strange
but
i
had
no
thought
of
murder
as
i
walked
up
the
garden
i
heard
a
shot
two
shots
and
then
a
cry
and
the
sound
of
something
falling
on
the
floor
the
door
of
the
house
was
open
and
the
light
was
burning
in
the
hall
upstairs
i
heard
the
noise
of
footsteps
quick
footsteps
and
then
i
heard
them
coming
down
the
staircase
i
was
afraid
and
i
hid
myself
behind
the
curtains
in
the
hall
the
footsteps
came
down
and
nearer
and
nearer
and
when
they
passed
me
i
looked
out
to
see
monsieur
it
was
pierre
i
called
to
him
softly
pierre
he
looked
round
and
his
face
it
was
so
different
so
dreadful
he
did
not
know
my
voice
and
he
ran
away
from
me
with
a
cry
monsieur
my
heart
is
a
brave
one
i
have
not
what
you
call
nerves
but
when
i
knew
i
was
alone
in
the
great
house
with
i
knew
not
what
a
great
fear
clutched
me
i
stood
still
in
the
hall
with
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
stairs
above
at
first
all
was
silent
then
i
heard
a
dreadful
sound
a
groan
i
wanted
to
run
away
then
monsieur
but
the
good
god
commanded
me
to
go
up
and
into
the
room
where
a
fellow
creature
needed
me
i
went
upstairs
and
along
to
the
door
of
a
room
which
was
half
open
i
pushed
it
wide
open
and
went
in
dieu
the
judge
was
alone
there
dying
pierre
had
shot
him
he
lay
along
the
floor
gasping
groaning
and
the
blood
dripping
from
his
breast
when
i
saw
this
i
ran
forward
and
took
his
poor
head
on
my
knee
and
tried
to
stop
the
blood
with
my
handkerchief
but
as
i
did
this
the
judge
groaned
once
more
he
knew
me
not
though
i
called
him
by
name
in
terrible
agony
he
writhed
his
head
off
my
breast
his
hand
clutched
at
the
hole
in
his
breast
closing
on
my
handkerchief
and
so
he
died
monsieur
strange
it
may
seem
but
i
do
assure
you
that
i
became
calm
again
when
he
was
dead
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
looked
round
me
in
the
room
on
the
floor
near
him
i
saw
a
revolver
i
picked
it
up
and
hid
it
in
my
bag
the
tube
of
it
was
warm
then
i
sat
down
in
a
chair
and
thought
what
i
must
do
the
police
must
not
know
i
was
there
they
must
not
know
he
was
my
lover
i
thought
of
my
letters
that
i
wrote
to
him
he
had
them
hidden
in
a
little
drawer
at
the
back
of
his
desk
a
secret
drawer
often
had
he
showed
me
my
letters
there
and
once
he
had
showed
me
where
to
find
the
spring
that
opened
the
drawer
so
i
searched
for
the
spring
and
i
found
it
the
drawer
opened
and
there
were
my
letters
tied
together
i
took
them
all
and
hid
them
in
my
bag
and
then
i
closed
the
hiding
place
there
remained
but
the
handkerchief
which
my
lover
held
in
his
hand
i
tried
to
get
it
out
but
i
could
not
in
my
hurry
i
dragged
it
out
it
came
away
then
but
left
a
little
bit
in
his
hand
it
did
not
show
i
dared
not
wait
longer
i
turned
out
the
light
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
and
downstairs
again
i
turned
out
the
light
and
closed
the
door
and
hurried
away
that
monsieur
is
my
story
chapter
xxiii
as
gabrielle
finished
her
story
she
cast
a
quick
glance
at
crewe
face
as
though
seeking
to
divine
his
decision
but
apparently
she
could
read
nothing
there
and
with
an
imperious
gesture
she
exclaimed
you
will
do
what
i
ask
now
that
i
have
exposed
my
secret
my
shame
to
you
and
told
everything
you
will
save
madame
holymead
from
being
persecuted
by
these
police
agents
i
must
ask
you
a
few
questions
first
the
contrast
between
the
detective
quiet
english
tones
and
the
frenchwoman
impetuous
appeal
was
accentuated
by
the
methodical
way
in
which
crewe
slowly
jotted
down
an
entry
in
his
open
notebook
her
dark
eyes
sparkled
in
an
agony
of
impatience
as
she
watched
him
ask
them
quick
monsieur
for
i
burn
in
the
suspense
in
the
first
place
then
have
you
any
hold
monsieur
i
know
what
you
would
ask
you
would
say
if
i
have
any
proofs
stupid
that
i
am
to
forget
things
so
important
i
have
brought
you
the
proofs
she
fumbled
at
the
clasp
of
her
as
she
spoke
and
before
she
had
finished
speaking
she
had
torn
it
open
and
emptied
its
contents
on
the
table
in
front
of
crewe
a
dainty
handkerchief
and
a
revolver
see
monsieur
she
cried
here
is
the
handkerchief
of
which
i
told
you
it
is
that
which
the
judge
seized
when
i
tried
to
stop
the
blood
flowing
in
his
breast
look
at
the
corner
and
you
will
see
that
a
little
bit
has
been
torn
off
by
his
almost
dead
hand
and
the
revolver
it
is
that
which
i
picked
up
on
the
floor
near
him
i
have
had
it
locked
up
ever
since
crewe
examined
both
articles
closely
the
revolver
was
a
small
weapon
with
silver
chasing
with
the
murdered
initials
engraved
in
the
handle
it
had
five
chambers
and
one
of
the
cartridges
had
been
discharged
the
other
four
chambers
were
still
loaded
crewe
carefully
extracted
the
cartridges
and
examined
them
closely
one
of
them
he
held
up
to
the
light
in
order
to
inspect
it
more
minutely
did
you
do
this
he
asked
have
you
been
trying
to
fire
off
the
revolver
no
no
monsieur
she
exclaimed
quickly
i
would
not
fire
it
i
do
not
understand
it
i
have
been
careful
not
to
touch
the
little
thing
that
sets
it
going
the
trigger
said
crewe
he
again
studied
the
cartridge
that
had
attracted
his
attention
it
had
missed
fire
for
on
the
cap
was
a
dint
where
the
hammer
had
struck
it
he
placed
the
four
cartridges
on
the
table
and
turning
his
attention
to
the
handkerchief
examined
it
minutely
it
was
one
of
those
filmy
scraps
of
muslin
and
lace
which
ladies
call
a
handkerchief
an
article
whose
cost
is
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
usefulness
gabrielle
who
was
watching
him
keenly
as
he
examined
it
exclaimed
the
handkerchief
a
box
of
them
were
given
me
by
sir
horace
because
he
knew
i
love
pretty
things
she
laid
a
finger
on
the
missing
corner
which
might
indeed
have
been
torn
off
in
the
manner
described
a
scrap
of
the
lace
was
missing
and
it
was
evident
that
it
had
been
removed
with
violence
for
the
lace
around
the
gap
was
loosened
and
the
muslin
slightly
frayed
you
say
that
the
corner
was
torn
off
when
you
wrenched
the
handkerchief
from
the
dead
man
hold
said
crewe
but
it
was
not
found
in
his
hand
by
the
police
or
anyone
else
and
he
was
not
buried
with
it
for
i
examined
the
body
carefully
what
became
of
it
gabrielle
looked
at
him
quickly
as
though
she
suspected
some
trap
you
would
play
with
me
she
said
at
length
what
became
of
it
why
you
must
surely
know
that
the
police
of
scot
scotland
yard
have
it
the
police
agent
who
called
on
madame
had
it
what
is
his
name
rudolf
rolfe
exclaimed
crewe
has
he
got
it
yes
she
replied
he
did
not
show
it
to
me
but
i
saw
it
nevertheless
i
dropped
my
handkerchief
when
i
spoke
at
the
telephone
and
monsieur
rolfe
picked
it
up
quickly
he
studied
my
handkerchief
not
this
one
monsieur
but
one
of
the
same
kind
and
from
his
he
took
out
the
missing
piece
that
was
in
the
dead
man
hand
and
he
studied
them
side
by
side
he
thought
i
did
not
see
that
my
back
was
turned
but
i
saw
in
the
mirror
which
hung
on
the
wall
then
when
i
finished
my
telephone
he
bowed
and
said
handkerchief
mademoiselle
it
was
not
so
badly
done
for
a
clumsy
police
agent
she
was
not
able
to
recognise
how
keen
was
crewe
interest
in
her
statement
but
she
saw
that
she
had
pleased
him
it
is
because
of
this
that
he
will
come
again
she
continued
it
is
because
of
this
that
he
would
question
madame
holymead
and
then
what
will
happen
i
do
not
know
the
police
make
so
many
mistakes
blunders
you
english
call
them
would
they
arrest
her
with
their
blunders
that
is
why
i
come
to
you
to
ask
you
to
save
her
may
i
have
the
revolver
and
the
handkerchief
asked
crewe
i
will
take
great
care
of
them
they
are
at
your
disposal
for
you
will
use
them
to
confront
the
police
agent
crewe
again
examined
the
articles
in
silence
before
taking
them
to
his
secrétaire
and
locking
them
up
in
one
of
the
then
he
turned
to
gabrielle
whose
large
luminous
eyes
met
his
unhesitatingly
she
even
smiled
slightly
a
frank
engaging
smile
as
she
remarked
and
now
monsieur
any
more
questions
crewe
smiled
back
at
her
you
have
told
a
remarkable
story
mademoiselle
and
corroborated
it
with
two
important
pieces
of
evidence
which
are
in
themselves
almost
sufficient
to
carry
conviction
he
said
but
the
scotland
yard
police
are
a
suspicious
lot
and
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
have
further
information
in
order
to
convince
them
if
i
am
to
help
you
as
you
wish
gabrielle
flashed
a
look
of
gratitude
at
crewe
she
understood
from
his
words
that
he
believed
her
story
and
was
disposed
to
help
her
although
the
police
of
scotland
yard
might
prove
harder
to
convince
than
him
bah
those
police
agents
they
are
the
same
everywhere
she
exclaimed
they
deal
so
much
with
crime
that
their
minds
get
the
taint
and
between
the
false
and
true
they
can
not
tell
the
difference
they
are
but
small
in
brains
with
you
the
case
is
different
you
have
it
here
and
there
she
touched
her
temples
lightly
with
a
finger
of
each
hand
proceed
monsieur
ask
me
what
questions
you
will
i
shall
endeavour
to
answer
them
you
said
that
as
you
were
hiding
behind
the
curtains
on
the
stairway
landing
pierre
your
husband
rushed
down
past
you
you
are
quite
sure
it
was
he
of
that
monsieur
unfortunately
there
is
no
doubt
i
saw
his
face
quite
distinctly
when
he
passed
me
and
when
he
turned
round
the
light
would
be
shining
from
behind
and
would
not
reveal
his
face
very
closely
suggested
crewe
nevertheless
monsieur
it
was
quite
sufficient
for
me
to
see
pierre
clearly
his
head
was
as
he
ran
as
though
he
was
looking
back
expecting
to
see
the
judge
rise
up
and
punish
him
for
his
dreadful
deed
and
i
saw
him
oh
most
distinctly
impossible
him
to
mistake
i
called
softly
just
like
that
and
he
turned
his
face
right
round
and
then
with
a
cry
he
disappeared
along
the
path
about
what
time
was
this
the
time
it
was
ten
for
that
was
the
time
i
was
to
be
there
according
to
the
letter
the
judge
sent
me
but
are
you
sure
it
was
ten
were
you
early
was
it
just
about
ten
no
monsieur
she
replied
sadly
if
it
had
been
ten
i
would
have
been
in
time
to
save
the
life
of
my
lover
to
prevent
this
great
tragedy
which
brings
grief
to
so
many
crewe
looked
at
her
sharply
and
then
nodded
his
head
in
acquiescence
of
the
fact
that
much
misery
would
have
been
averted
if
she
had
been
in
time
to
save
the
life
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
when
you
went
into
the
room
sir
horace
fewbanks
you
say
was
lying
on
the
floor
dying
whereabouts
in
the
room
was
he
if
he
had
been
in
this
room
he
would
have
been
lying
just
behind
you
with
his
head
to
the
wall
and
his
feet
pointing
towards
that
window
he
struggled
and
groaned
after
i
went
in
and
altered
his
position
a
little
but
not
much
he
died
so
crewe
rapidly
reviewed
his
recollection
of
the
room
in
which
the
judge
had
been
killed
once
again
gabrielle
statement
tallied
with
his
own
reconstruction
of
the
crime
and
the
manner
of
its
perpetration
if
the
murder
had
been
committed
in
his
office
the
second
bullet
would
have
gone
through
the
window
instead
of
imbedding
itself
in
the
wall
and
the
judge
would
have
fallen
in
the
spot
where
she
indicated
and
where
was
the
from
where
you
got
your
letters
was
crewe
next
question
it
was
over
there
almost
by
that
your
little
bookcase
there
she
pointed
to
a
small
oaken
bookstand
which
stood
slightly
in
advance
of
the
more
imposing
shelves
in
which
reposed
the
portentous
volumes
of
newspaper
clippings
and
photographs
which
constituted
rogues
library
now
we
come
to
the
letters
you
took
them
from
the
secret
drawer
in
the
desk
why
did
you
remove
them
because
i
would
not
have
the
police
agents
find
them
for
then
they
would
want
to
know
so
much
and
what
did
you
do
with
them
monsieur
crewe
i
destroyed
them
when
i
got
home
i
burnt
them
all
i
was
so
frightened
you
mean
you
were
frightened
to
keep
them
in
your
possession
after
the
judge
was
killed
yes
what
place
had
i
to
keep
them
safe
from
prying
eyes
so
monsieur
i
burnt
them
all
one
by
one
and
the
charred
fragments
i
kept
and
took
into
the
park
next
day
where
i
scattered
them
unobserved
and
what
became
of
the
letter
you
wrote
to
sir
horace
fewbanks
at
craigleith
hall
asking
him
to
come
to
london
and
save
you
from
your
husband
persecutions
she
looked
at
him
earnestly
in
the
endeavour
to
ascertain
if
he
had
laid
a
trap
for
her
sir
horace
destroyed
it
in
scotland
i
suppose
if
the
police
did
not
find
it
strange
that
he
should
have
kept
all
your
other
letters
so
carefully
and
destroyed
that
one
perhaps
it
was
in
his
that
was
stolen
i
do
not
know
what
does
it
matter
it
has
gone
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
lightly
and
indifferently
do
you
know
who
stole
the
no
monsieur
i
thought
it
was
stolen
in
the
train
that
is
the
police
theory
replied
crewe
but
let
that
go
have
you
since
the
night
of
the
murder
seen
anything
of
pierre
monsieur
i
have
not
it
is
as
though
the
earth
has
him
swallowed
he
keeps
silent
with
the
silence
of
the
grave
he
is
wise
to
do
so
responded
crewe
now
mademoiselle
i
have
no
more
questions
to
ask
you
your
confidence
is
safe
you
need
be
under
no
apprehensions
on
that
score
i
care
not
for
myself
monsieur
crewe
so
long
as
madame
holymead
is
freed
from
the
persecutions
of
the
police
agents
replied
gabrielle
rising
from
her
seat
as
she
spoke
if
after
hearing
my
story
you
could
but
give
me
the
assurance
i
think
i
can
safely
promise
you
that
holymead
will
not
be
troubled
with
any
further
police
attentions
said
crewe
after
a
moment
pause
gabrielle
broke
into
profuse
expressions
of
gratitude
as
she
turned
to
go
for
the
rest
then
i
care
not
what
happens
i
am
how
do
you
say
it
i
am
overjoyed
vous
monsieur
i
beg
you
not
i
can
find
my
way
out
unattended
but
crewe
showed
her
to
the
stairs
where
again
he
had
to
listen
to
her
profuse
thanks
before
she
finally
departed
he
watched
her
graceful
figure
till
it
was
lost
to
sight
in
the
winding
staircase
and
then
he
turned
back
to
his
office
in
the
outer
office
he
stopped
to
speak
to
joe
who
perched
on
an
was
tapping
quickly
on
the
with
his
swaying
backwards
and
forwards
dangerously
on
his
perch
in
the
intensity
of
his
emotions
as
he
played
the
hero
part
in
the
drama
of
saving
the
runaway
engine
from
dashing
into
the
express
by
calling
up
the
red
gulch
station
on
the
wire
joe
said
crewe
i
see
nobody
for
an
hour
at
least
nobody
you
understand
joe
came
out
of
the
cinema
world
long
enough
to
nod
his
head
in
emphatic
understanding
of
the
instructions
in
his
own
room
crewe
pulled
out
his
notebook
and
once
more
gave
himself
up
to
the
study
of
the
baffling
riversbrook
mystery
in
the
new
light
of
gabrielle
confession
part
of
her
story
he
reflected
must
be
true
she
had
produced
sir
horace
revolver
and
still
more
important
a
handkerchief
which
he
had
clutched
in
his
dying
struggles
it
was
obvious
that
she
or
some
other
woman
had
been
at
riversbrook
the
night
of
the
murder
and
in
the
room
with
the
murdered
man
before
he
died
that
tallied
with
statement
to
hill
that
he
had
seen
a
woman
close
the
front
door
and
walk
along
the
garden
path
while
he
was
hiding
in
the
garden
crewe
recalling
gabrielle
description
of
the
room
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
probably
she
who
had
been
with
the
judge
in
his
dying
moments
no
one
but
a
person
who
had
actually
seen
it
could
have
described
the
room
with
such
minuteness
she
had
been
in
the
room
then
for
what
object
for
the
reasons
stated
in
her
confession
crewe
shook
his
head
doubtfully
she
evaded
the
trap
about
the
but
she
made
one
bad
mistake
he
mused
the
letters
in
the
secret
drawer
were
taken
away
and
i
have
no
doubt
were
burnt
as
she
says
but
were
they
her
letters
was
sir
horace
her
lover
at
any
rate
she
did
not
get
hold
of
them
in
the
way
she
said
they
were
not
taken
away
on
the
night
sir
horace
was
murdered
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
were
not
in
the
secret
drawer
at
the
time
chapter
xxiv
rolfe
was
spending
a
quiet
evening
in
his
room
after
a
trying
inquiries
into
a
confidence
trick
case
inquiries
so
fruitless
that
they
had
brought
down
on
his
head
an
official
reproof
from
inspector
chippenfield
rolfe
had
left
scotland
yard
that
evening
in
a
somewhat
despondent
frame
of
mind
in
consequence
but
a
brisk
walk
home
and
a
good
supper
had
done
him
so
much
good
that
with
a
tranquil
mind
and
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
he
was
able
to
devote
himself
to
the
hobby
of
his
leisure
hours
with
keen
enjoyment
this
hobby
would
have
excited
the
wondering
contempt
of
joe
leaver
whose
frequent
attendance
at
cinema
theatres
had
led
him
to
the
conclusion
that
police
detectives
who
unlike
his
master
had
to
take
the
rough
with
the
smooth
spent
their
spare
time
practising
revolver
shooting
and
throwing
daggers
at
an
ace
of
hearts
on
the
wall
rolfe
hobby
was
nothing
more
exciting
than
stamp
collecting
he
was
deeply
versed
in
the
lore
of
stamps
and
his
private
ambition
was
to
become
the
possessor
of
a
blue
mauritius
his
collection
though
extensive
was
by
no
means
of
fabulous
value
being
made
up
chiefly
of
modest
purchases
from
the
stamp
collecting
shops
and
finds
in
the
at
scotland
yard
after
the
arrival
of
the
foreign
mails
that
day
he
had
made
a
particularly
good
haul
from
the
for
his
catch
included
several
comparatively
good
specimens
from
japan
and
fiji
he
sat
gloating
over
these
treasures
examining
them
carefully
and
holding
each
one
up
to
the
light
as
he
separated
it
from
the
piece
of
paper
to
which
it
had
been
affixed
he
pasted
them
one
by
one
in
his
stamp
album
with
loving
lingering
fingers
adjusting
each
stamp
in
its
little
square
in
the
book
with
meticulous
care
he
was
so
absorbed
in
this
occupation
that
he
did
not
hear
the
ascending
footsteps
drawing
nearer
to
his
door
and
did
not
see
a
visitor
at
the
door
when
the
footsteps
ceased
it
was
crewe
voice
that
recalled
him
back
from
the
stamp
collector
imaginary
world
why
crewe
said
rolfe
with
evident
pleasure
who
have
thought
of
seeing
you
your
landlady
asked
me
if
i
come
up
myself
said
crewe
in
explaining
his
intrusion
she
much
worried
and
put
about
to
say
nothing
of
having
a
bad
back
to
show
me
upstairs
i
never
known
her
to
be
well
said
rolfe
with
a
laugh
every
morning
when
she
brings
up
my
breakfast
i
got
to
hear
details
of
her
bad
back
which
should
be
kept
for
the
confidential
ear
of
the
doctor
but
she
regards
me
as
a
son
i
think
i
been
here
so
long
but
now
you
are
here
crewe
rolfe
waited
in
polite
expectation
that
his
visitor
would
disclose
the
object
of
his
visit
but
crewe
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
do
so
he
produced
his
cigar
case
and
offered
rolfe
a
cigar
which
the
latter
accepted
with
a
pleasant
recollection
of
the
excellent
flavour
of
the
cigars
the
private
detective
kept
when
each
of
them
had
his
cigar
well
alight
crewe
glanced
at
the
open
stamp
album
and
commenced
talking
about
stamps
it
was
a
subject
which
rolfe
was
always
willing
to
discuss
crewe
declared
that
he
was
an
ignorant
outsider
as
far
as
stamps
were
concerned
but
he
professed
to
have
a
respectful
admiration
for
those
who
immersed
themselves
in
such
a
fascinating
subject
rolfe
with
the
fervid
egoism
of
the
collector
talked
about
stamps
for
half
an
hour
without
recalling
that
his
visitor
must
have
come
to
talk
about
something
else
i
got
a
small
stamp
collection
in
my
office
said
crewe
when
rolfe
paused
for
a
moment
it
belonged
to
that
jewish
diamond
merchant
who
was
shot
in
hatton
gardens
two
years
ago
you
remember
his
case
rather
that
was
a
smart
bit
of
work
of
yours
crewe
in
laying
your
hands
on
the
woman
who
did
it
and
getting
back
the
diamond
crewe
smiled
in
response
the
jew
was
very
grateful
poor
fellow
he
died
in
the
hospital
after
the
trial
so
she
was
lucky
to
escape
with
twelve
years
he
left
me
a
diamond
ring
and
a
stamp
album
that
had
come
into
his
possession
i
should
like
to
see
it
said
rolfe
eagerly
it
is
more
than
likely
that
there
are
some
good
specimens
in
it
the
jews
are
keen
collectors
if
you
let
me
have
a
look
at
it
i
tell
you
what
the
collection
is
worth
you
can
have
it
altogether
said
crewe
i
send
my
boy
joe
round
with
it
in
the
morning
oh
crewe
it
very
good
of
you
said
rolfe
with
the
covetousness
of
the
collector
shining
in
his
eyes
nonsense
why
should
you
have
it
but
i
did
come
round
here
solely
to
talk
about
stamps
rolfe
i
came
to
have
a
little
chat
about
the
riversbrook
case
how
are
you
getting
on
with
it
why
really
said
rolfe
i
not
done
much
with
it
since
since
since
birchill
was
acquitted
eh
but
you
are
not
letting
it
drop
altogether
are
you
that
would
be
a
pity
such
an
interesting
case
whom
have
you
your
eye
on
now
as
the
right
man
rolfe
who
thought
he
detected
a
suspicion
of
banter
in
remarks
evaded
the
latter
question
by
answering
the
first
part
of
crewe
inquiry
why
hardly
that
crewe
but
the
chief
is
not
very
keen
on
the
case
birchill
acquittal
was
too
much
of
a
blow
to
him
he
reckons
that
nowadays
juries
are
too
to
convict
on
a
capital
charge
it
just
as
well
that
they
are
too
to
convict
the
wrong
man
said
crewe
yes
you
told
me
from
the
first
that
we
were
on
the
wrong
track
was
the
reply
i
have
forgotten
that
and
the
chief
is
not
allowed
to
forget
it
either
all
the
men
at
the
yard
know
that
you
held
the
opinion
that
we
had
got
hold
of
the
wrong
man
when
we
arrested
birchill
and
he
has
had
to
stand
so
much
chaff
in
the
office
that
he
pretty
raw
about
it
rolfe
spoke
in
the
detached
tone
of
a
junior
who
had
no
share
in
his
chief
mistakes
or
their
attendant
humiliation
and
he
added
that
once
more
that
you
scored
over
scotland
yard
crewe
and
you
ought
to
be
proud
of
it
he
glanced
covertly
at
crewe
to
see
how
he
took
the
flattery
so
you
done
very
little
about
the
case
since
birchill
was
acquitted
was
his
only
remark
i
been
so
busy
replied
rolfe
again
evading
the
question
and
avoiding
meeting
crewe
glance
by
turning
over
the
leaves
of
his
stamp
album
you
see
there
has
been
a
rush
of
work
at
scotland
yard
lately
there
is
that
big
burglary
at
lord
emden
and
the
case
of
the
woman
whose
body
was
found
in
the
river
lock
at
peyton
and
half
a
dozen
other
cases
all
important
in
their
way
there
has
been
quite
an
epidemic
of
crime
lately
as
you
know
crewe
i
do
seem
to
get
a
minute
to
myself
these
times
rolfe
said
crewe
drily
you
protest
too
much
you
do
suppose
that
after
coming
over
here
to
see
you
that
i
can
be
deceived
by
such
talk
rolfe
flushed
at
these
uncompromising
words
but
before
he
could
speak
crewe
proceeded
in
a
milder
tone
i
do
blame
you
a
bit
for
trying
to
put
me
off
it
all
part
of
the
game
we
rivals
in
a
sense
and
you
are
quite
right
not
to
lose
sight
of
that
fact
but
as
a
detective
rolfe
your
methods
lack
polish
really
i
blush
for
them
you
might
have
known
that
i
came
over
here
to
see
you
because
i
had
an
important
object
in
view
and
you
should
have
tried
to
find
out
what
it
was
before
playing
your
own
cards
and
such
cards
too
you
sadly
lacking
in
finesse
rolfe
you
never
make
a
chess
player
your
concealed
intentions
are
too
easily
discovered
you
must
try
not
to
be
so
transparent
if
you
want
to
succeed
in
your
profession
crewe
delivered
his
reproof
with
such
good
humour
that
rolfe
stared
at
him
as
if
unable
to
make
out
what
his
visitor
was
driving
at
i
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
crewe
he
said
at
length
oh
yes
you
do
you
know
i
speaking
about
your
latest
move
in
the
riversbrook
case
which
you
been
so
busy
with
of
late
and
i
come
to
tell
you
in
a
friendly
way
that
once
more
you
on
the
wrong
track
what
do
you
mean
asked
rolfe
quickly
why
princes
gate
of
course
replied
crewe
cheerily
you
suppose
that
a
young
man
like
yourself
could
be
seen
in
the
neighbourhood
of
princes
gate
without
causing
a
flutter
among
feminine
hearts
there
do
you
so
the
servants
have
been
talking
have
they
muttered
rolfe
they
have
and
they
have
but
that
beside
the
point
what
i
want
to
say
is
that
you
on
the
wrong
track
in
suspecting
holymead
and
i
strongly
advise
you
to
drop
your
inquiries
if
you
do
want
to
get
yourself
into
hot
water
she
as
innocent
of
the
murder
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
as
birchill
is
but
you
can
not
afford
to
make
a
false
shot
in
the
case
of
a
lady
of
her
social
standing
as
you
did
with
a
criminal
like
birchill
at
this
rebuke
rolfe
gave
way
to
irritation
look
here
crewe
i
thank
you
to
mind
your
own
business
he
said
it
got
nothing
to
do
with
you
where
i
make
inquiries
i
have
you
remember
that
i
do
interfere
with
you
and
i
wo
have
you
interfering
with
me
but
i
interfering
only
for
your
own
good
man
what
do
you
suppose
doing
it
for
i
tell
you
you
riding
for
a
very
bad
fall
in
suspecting
holymead
and
shadowing
her
crewe
plain
words
were
an
echo
of
a
secret
fear
which
rolfe
had
entertained
from
the
time
his
suspicions
were
directed
towards
holymead
but
he
was
not
going
to
allow
crewe
to
think
he
was
alarmed
if
i
making
inquiries
about
holymead
it
because
i
have
ample
justification
for
doing
so
he
said
stiffly
and
i
tell
you
that
you
have
not
prove
it
exclaimed
rolfe
defiantly
crewe
produced
from
his
pocket
a
revolver
and
a
lady
handkerchief
and
handed
them
to
rolfe
without
speaking
rolfe
embarrassment
was
almost
equal
to
his
astonishment
as
he
examined
the
articles
in
the
handkerchief
with
its
missing
corner
he
speedily
recognised
something
for
which
he
had
searched
in
vain
he
had
never
confided
to
crewe
the
discovery
of
the
missing
corner
in
the
dead
hand
and
therefore
the
production
of
the
handkerchief
by
crewe
considerably
embarrassed
him
he
longed
to
ask
crewe
how
he
had
obtained
possession
of
the
handkerchief
but
he
could
not
trust
his
voice
to
frame
the
question
without
betraying
his
feelings
so
he
picked
up
the
revolver
and
examined
it
closely
then
he
put
it
down
and
again
gave
his
attention
to
the
handkerchief
bending
his
head
over
it
so
that
crewe
should
not
see
his
face
you
do
not
seem
very
astonished
at
my
finds
rolfe
said
crewe
quizzically
perhaps
you
seen
these
articles
before
no
i
have
said
rolfe
still
avoiding
his
visitor
eye
well
the
torn
handkerchief
is
not
exactly
new
to
you
said
crewe
you
got
the
missing
part
you
found
it
in
sir
horace
hand
after
he
was
murdered
you
too
clever
for
me
and
that
the
simple
truth
crewe
said
rolfe
in
a
mortified
tone
i
did
find
a
small
piece
of
a
lady
handkerchief
in
his
hand
and
here
it
is
he
produced
his
and
took
out
the
piece
how
you
found
out
i
had
it
is
more
than
i
know
mere
said
crewe
rolfe
shook
his
head
slowly
i
know
better
than
that
he
said
you
deep
you
do
miss
much
i
wish
now
that
i
had
told
you
about
that
bit
of
handkerchief
at
the
first
but
chippenfield
and
i
wanted
to
have
all
the
credit
of
elucidating
the
riversbrook
mystery
i
hunted
high
and
low
to
get
trace
of
this
handkerchief
but
i
could
and
now
you
beaten
me
although
you
could
have
known
at
first
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
missing
handkerchief
in
the
case
i
hope
you
bear
me
no
malice
mr
crewe
what
for
rolfe
for
not
telling
you
about
the
handkerchief
after
i
found
this
piece
in
sir
horace
hand
not
in
the
least
said
crewe
why
should
you
have
told
me
i
tell
you
everything
that
i
find
out
it
all
part
of
the
game
that
piece
of
the
handkerchief
was
a
good
find
rolfe
and
i
congratulate
you
on
getting
it
how
did
you
come
to
discover
it
i
was
trying
to
force
open
the
murdered
man
hand
and
i
found
it
clenched
between
the
little
finger
and
the
next
of
course
it
was
not
visible
with
his
hand
closed
chippenfield
who
missed
it
half
like
my
discovery
and
all
along
he
underestimated
the
value
of
it
as
a
clue
well
he
has
had
to
pay
for
his
folly
he
has
and
serves
him
right
replied
rolfe
viciously
he
the
most
obstinate
vain
man
you
could
come
across
it
occurred
to
rolfe
that
it
was
not
exactly
good
form
on
his
part
to
condemn
his
superior
officer
so
vigorously
in
the
presence
of
a
rival
so
he
broke
off
abruptly
and
asked
crewe
how
he
came
into
possession
of
the
revolver
and
handkerchief
crewe
reply
was
that
he
had
obtained
these
articles
under
a
promise
of
secrecy
from
some
one
who
had
assured
him
that
holymead
had
no
connection
with
the
crime
when
he
was
at
liberty
to
tell
the
story
as
it
had
been
told
to
him
rolfe
would
be
the
first
to
hear
it
holymead
had
no
connection
with
the
crime
exclaimed
rolfe
impatiently
perhaps
you
do
know
that
the
morning
after
the
murder
was
discovered
she
went
out
to
riversbrook
and
removed
some
secret
papers
from
the
murdered
man
desk
papers
that
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
hiding
in
a
secret
drawer
yes
i
know
that
said
crewe
well
does
that
look
as
if
she
knew
something
about
the
crime
not
necessarily
well
to
me
it
does
what
were
these
secret
papers
they
were
letters
i
am
told
i
believe
so
and
you
rolfe
as
a
man
of
the
world
know
that
a
married
woman
would
not
like
the
police
to
get
possession
of
letters
she
had
written
to
a
man
of
the
reputation
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
i
admit
that
her
action
is
capable
of
a
comparatively
innocent
interpretation
but
taken
in
conjunction
with
other
things
it
looks
to
me
mighty
suspicious
in
hill
statement
to
us
he
told
us
that
on
the
night
of
the
murder
birchill
when
hiding
in
the
garden
waiting
for
the
lights
to
go
out
before
breaking
into
the
house
heard
the
front
door
slam
and
saw
a
stylish
sort
of
woman
walk
down
the
path
to
the
gate
that
was
not
holymead
said
crewe
how
do
you
know
if
it
was
not
her
who
was
it
do
you
know
i
think
i
know
and
when
i
am
at
liberty
to
speak
i
will
tell
you
then
there
is
a
third
point
continued
rolfe
look
at
this
handkerchief
you
brought
i
saw
a
handkerchief
of
exactly
similar
pattern
at
holymead
house
when
i
called
there
was
that
the
property
of
her
french
cousin
mademoiselle
chiron
yes
she
dropped
it
on
the
floor
while
i
was
there
but
it
is
probable
the
handkerchief
was
one
of
a
set
given
her
by
mrs
holymead
quite
probably
rolfe
but
scores
of
ladies
who
are
fond
of
expensive
things
have
handkerchiefs
of
a
similar
pattern
you
will
find
if
you
inquire
among
the
west
end
shops
that
although
it
is
a
dainty
expensive
article
from
the
man
point
of
view
there
is
nothing
singular
about
the
quality
or
the
pattern
perhaps
so
said
rolfe
but
the
possession
of
handkerchiefs
of
this
kind
is
surely
suspicious
when
taken
in
conjunction
with
her
removal
of
the
letters
i
wish
i
could
get
hold
of
that
infernal
scoundrel
hill
again
i
am
convinced
that
he
knows
a
great
deal
more
about
this
murder
than
he
has
yet
told
us
and
a
great
deal
more
about
holymead
and
her
letters
i
had
his
shop
watched
day
and
night
since
he
disappeared
but
he
keeps
close
to
his
burrow
and
i
not
been
able
to
get
on
his
track
i
give
up
watching
for
him
if
i
were
you
said
crewe
as
he
flicked
the
ash
of
his
cigar
into
the
fireplace
you
not
likely
to
find
him
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
has
left
the
country
hill
left
the
country
echoed
rolfe
i
think
you
are
mistaken
there
crewe
he
had
no
money
how
could
he
get
away
crewe
selected
another
cigar
from
his
case
and
lighted
it
before
answering
the
fact
is
i
advanced
him
the
money
he
said
technically
it
a
loan
but
i
do
not
think
any
of
it
will
be
paid
back
rolfe
stared
hard
at
crewe
to
see
if
he
was
joking
what
on
earth
made
you
do
that
he
demanded
at
length
hill
may
be
the
actual
murderer
for
all
we
know
not
at
all
was
the
reply
before
i
helped
him
to
leave
england
i
satisfied
myself
that
he
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
murder
he
does
not
know
who
shot
sir
horace
fewbanks
though
of
course
he
still
half
believes
that
it
was
birchill
when
i
got
in
touch
with
him
after
his
disappearance
he
was
in
a
pitiable
state
of
fright
waking
or
sleeping
he
could
get
his
mind
off
the
gallows
there
were
two
or
three
points
on
which
i
wanted
his
assistance
in
clearing
up
the
riversbrook
case
and
i
promised
to
get
him
out
of
the
country
if
he
would
make
a
clean
breast
of
things
and
tell
me
the
truth
as
far
as
he
knew
it
he
made
a
confession
a
true
one
this
time
i
took
it
down
and
i
let
you
have
a
copy
there
are
a
few
interesting
points
on
which
it
differs
materially
from
the
statement
he
made
to
the
police
when
you
and
chippenfield
cornered
him
what
are
they
asked
rolfe
in
the
first
place
the
burglary
was
his
idea
and
not
birchill
replied
crewe
after
the
quarrel
between
sir
horace
and
the
girl
fanning
he
went
out
to
her
flat
and
suggested
to
birchill
that
he
should
rob
riversbrook
hill
real
object
in
arranging
this
burglary
was
to
get
possession
of
the
letters
which
holymead
subsequently
removed
but
he
did
not
tell
birchill
this
his
plan
was
to
go
to
riversbrook
the
morning
after
the
burglary
and
then
break
open
sir
horace
desk
and
open
the
secret
drawer
before
informing
the
police
of
the
burglary
to
the
police
and
sir
horace
it
would
look
as
though
the
burglar
had
accidentally
found
the
spring
of
the
secret
drawer
with
these
letters
in
his
possession
hill
intended
to
blackmail
sir
horace
or
holymead
without
disclosing
himself
in
the
transaction
when
sir
horace
returned
unexpectedly
from
scotland
on
the
of
august
hill
had
just
removed
the
letters
from
the
desk
being
afraid
that
when
birchill
broke
into
the
house
he
might
find
them
accidentally
he
was
naturally
in
a
state
of
alarm
at
sir
horace
return
he
tried
to
get
an
opportunity
to
put
the
letters
back
as
sir
horace
might
discover
they
had
been
removed
but
sir
horace
dismissed
him
for
the
night
before
he
could
get
such
an
opportunity
then
he
went
to
fanning
flat
and
told
birchill
that
sir
horace
had
returned
birchill
was
in
favour
of
postponing
the
burglary
but
hill
who
had
possession
of
the
letters
and
did
not
know
when
he
would
get
an
opportunity
to
put
them
back
urged
birchill
to
carry
out
the
burglary
he
assured
birchill
that
sir
horace
was
a
very
sound
sleeper
and
that
there
would
be
no
risk
in
order
to
arouse
birchill
cupidity
and
to
protect
himself
from
the
suspicions
of
sir
horace
regarding
the
letters
he
told
birchill
that
he
had
seen
a
large
sum
of
money
in
his
possession
when
he
returned
and
that
this
money
would
probably
be
hidden
in
the
secret
drawer
of
the
desk
until
sir
horace
had
an
opportunity
of
banking
it
he
told
birchill
to
break
open
the
desk
and
explained
to
him
how
to
find
the
spring
of
the
secret
drawer
what
a
damned
cunning
scoundrel
he
is
exclaimed
rolfe
in
unwilling
admiration
of
the
completeness
of
hill
scheme
do
you
think
crewe
that
after
all
he
may
be
the
actual
murderer
that
he
told
you
a
lot
of
lies
just
as
he
did
to
us
holymead
in
his
address
to
the
jury
made
out
a
pretty
strong
case
against
him
no
one
knows
better
than
holymead
that
hill
did
not
commit
the
murder
said
crewe
hill
is
an
incorrigible
liar
but
he
has
no
nerve
for
murder
did
he
put
the
letters
back
asked
rolfe
he
told
me
that
holymead
stole
them
the
day
after
the
murder
was
discovered
but
he
is
such
a
liar
i
believe
he
spoke
the
truth
in
that
case
said
crewe
he
told
me
he
put
the
letters
back
in
the
secret
drawer
the
night
after
the
murder
when
he
went
to
riversbrook
to
report
himself
to
chippenfield
he
put
them
back
because
he
was
afraid
that
if
the
police
found
them
in
his
possession
they
would
think
he
had
a
hand
in
the
murder
his
idea
was
to
remove
them
from
the
secret
drawer
after
the
excitement
about
the
murder
died
down
and
then
blackmail
holymead
but
she
acted
with
a
skill
and
decision
that
robbed
him
of
his
chance
to
blackmail
her
how
did
you
get
hold
of
the
cunning
scoundrel
asked
rolfe
i
had
his
wife
shop
watched
day
and
night
as
i
said
i
made
sure
he
would
try
to
communicate
with
her
sooner
or
later
but
he
did
it
was
joe
who
found
him
said
crewe
i
knew
you
were
watching
hill
shop
so
it
was
superfluous
for
me
to
set
anybody
to
watch
it
besides
i
did
think
hill
would
visit
his
wife
or
attempt
to
communicate
with
her
for
he
would
think
that
the
police
if
they
wanted
him
would
be
sure
to
watch
the
shop
i
tried
to
consider
what
a
man
like
hill
would
do
in
the
circumstances
he
had
no
money
i
knew
that
and
so
far
as
i
was
able
to
ascertain
he
had
no
friends
who
were
likely
to
hide
him
without
friends
or
money
he
could
not
go
very
far
finally
it
occurred
to
me
that
he
might
be
hiding
somewhere
in
riversbrook
either
in
that
unfinished
portion
of
the
third
floor
or
in
one
of
the
outbuildings
he
knew
the
run
of
the
rambling
old
place
so
well
have
you
ever
been
over
it
carefully
no
well
there
are
several
good
places
in
the
upper
stories
where
a
man
might
conceal
himself
i
put
joe
on
the
job
and
after
watching
for
several
nights
joe
got
him
hill
had
made
a
hiding
place
in
the
loft
above
the
garage
it
appears
that
he
subsisted
on
the
stores
that
had
been
left
in
the
house
he
was
able
to
make
his
way
into
the
main
building
through
one
of
the
kitchen
windows
he
was
on
one
of
these
foraging
expeditions
when
joe
discovered
him
emaciated
dirty
and
half
demented
through
terror
of
the
gallows
so
that
is
how
you
got
him
said
rolfe
i
never
thought
of
looking
for
him
at
riversbrook
sometimes
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
you
that
he
had
no
nerve
for
murder
but
an
unpremeditated
murder
does
want
much
nerve
he
might
have
done
it
in
a
moment
of
passion
rolfe
was
endeavouring
to
take
advantage
of
crewe
communicative
mood
and
to
arrive
by
a
process
of
elimination
at
the
person
against
whom
crewe
had
accumulated
his
evidence
it
was
not
hill
said
crewe
the
murder
was
committed
in
a
moment
of
passion
and
yet
it
was
far
from
being
unpremeditated
you
are
trying
to
mystify
me
said
rolfe
despairingly
no
it
is
the
case
itself
which
has
mystified
you
replied
crewe
it
has
was
rolfe
candid
confession
the
more
thought
i
give
it
the
more
impossible
it
seems
to
see
through
it
was
sir
horace
killed
before
dusk
before
the
lights
were
turned
on
if
he
was
killed
after
dark
who
turned
out
the
lights
he
was
killed
between
and
at
night
said
crewe
the
lights
were
turned
out
by
the
woman
birchill
saw
leaving
the
house
about
but
she
was
not
the
murderer
and
she
was
not
present
in
the
room
or
even
in
the
house
when
sir
horace
was
shot
she
arrived
a
few
minutes
too
late
to
prevent
the
tragedy
turning
out
the
lights
was
an
instinctive
act
due
to
her
desire
to
hide
the
crime
or
rather
to
hide
the
murderer
how
do
you
know
all
this
asked
rolfe
who
had
been
staring
at
crewe
with
astonishment
that
woman
was
not
holymead
continued
crewe
i
had
a
visit
from
the
woman
who
did
these
things
and
as
evidence
of
the
truth
of
her
story
she
brought
me
the
revolver
and
the
handkerchief
what
did
she
come
to
you
for
asked
rolfe
with
breathless
interest
what
did
she
want
she
came
to
me
to
make
a
full
confession
said
crewe
in
even
tones
a
confession
exclaimed
rolfe
she
ought
to
have
come
to
the
police
why
did
she
come
to
us
crewe
smiled
at
the
puzzled
indignant
detective
i
think
she
came
to
me
because
she
wanted
to
mislead
me

chapter
xxv
joe
leaver
worn
out
after
nearly
a
week
work
of
watching
the
movements
of
holymead
had
fallen
asleep
in
an
empty
loft
above
a
garage
which
overlooked
verney
hotel
in
mayfair
he
had
seen
holymead
disappear
into
the
hotel
and
he
knew
from
the
experience
gained
in
his
watch
that
the
would
spend
the
next
couple
of
hours
in
dressing
for
dinner
sitting
down
to
that
meal
and
smoking
a
cigar
in
the
lounge
so
joe
had
relaxed
for
the
time
being
the
new
task
which
his
master
had
set
him
and
had
flung
himself
on
some
straw
in
the
loft
to
rest
he
did
not
intend
to
go
to
sleep
but
he
was
very
tired
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
in
a
profound
slumber
in
his
sleep
joe
dreamed
that
he
had
attained
the
summit
of
his
ambition
and
was
being
paid
a
huge
salary
by
an
american
film
company
to
display
himself
in
emotional
dramas
for
the
educational
improvement
of
the
british
working
classes
in
his
dream
he
had
to
rescue
the
heroine
from
the
clutches
of
the
villains
who
had
carried
her
off
they
had
imprisoned
her
at
the
top
of
a
skyscraper
building
and
locked
the
lift
but
joe
climbed
the
fire
escape
and
caught
the
beautiful
girl
in
his
arms
the
villains
who
were
on
the
watch
set
fire
to
the
building
and
when
joe
attempted
to
climb
out
of
the
window
with
the
heroine
clinging
round
his
neck
the
flames
drove
him
back
as
he
stood
there
the
wind
swept
a
sheet
of
flame
towards
joe
until
it
scorched
his
face
the
pain
was
so
real
that
joe
opened
his
eyes
and
sprang
up
with
a
cry
a
man
was
standing
over
him
a
man
past
middle
age
short
and
broad
in
figure
whose
face
directed
attention
to
his
protruding
jaw
he
was
wearing
a
blue
serge
suit
which
had
seen
much
use
you
are
a
sound
sleeper
sonny
said
the
man
grinning
at
joe
alarm
but
when
you
wake
why
you
wake
up
properly
i
say
that
for
you
you
nearly
broke
my
pipe
you
woke
up
that
sudden
he
made
this
remark
with
such
a
malicious
grin
that
joe
whose
face
was
still
smarting
had
no
hesitation
in
connecting
his
sudden
awakening
with
the
hot
bowl
of
the
man
pipe
it
was
a
joke
joe
had
often
seen
played
on
drunken
men
in
islington
in
his
young
days
you
just
leave
me
alone
will
you
he
said
rubbing
his
cheek
ruefully
it
nothing
to
do
with
you
whether
i
a
sound
sleeper
or
not
that
just
where
you
wrong
young
fellow
was
the
reply
it
a
lot
to
do
with
me
ai
your
name
joe
leaver
joe
nodded
his
head
how
did
you
find
out
he
asked
perhaps
a
friend
of
mine
pointed
you
out
to
me
perhaps
he
did
and
perhaps
he
did
said
joe
anyway
what
is
your
name
kemp
is
my
name
my
boy
and
unless
you
pretty
civil
i
give
you
cause
to
remember
it
what
have
you
got
to
do
with
me
asked
the
boy
in
an
injured
tone
i
never
done
nothing
to
you
you
mind
your
p
and
q
and
me
and
you
get
along
all
right
said
kemp
in
a
somewhat
softer
tone
when
you
ask
me
what
i
got
to
do
with
you
my
answer
is
i
got
a
lot
to
do
with
you
for
i
your
guardian
so
to
speak
joe
looked
at
kemp
with
a
gleam
of
comprehension
in
his
amazement
he
had
had
some
experience
in
his
islington
days
of
the
strange
phenomena
produced
by
drink
rats
he
retorted
rudely
i
never
had
a
guardian
and
i
do
want
none
what
made
you
a
guardian
i
like
to
know
your
father
did
was
the
reply
oh
him
said
joe
in
a
tone
which
indicated
pronounced
antipathy
to
his
parent
do
you
know
him
are
you
one
of
his
sort
now
do
try
to
be
insulting
my
boy
or
i
take
you
across
my
knee
we
wo
say
nothing
about
where
your
father
is
because
in
high
society
wormwood
scrubbs
is
mentioned
all
we
say
is
that
he
has
been
unfortunate
like
many
another
man
before
him
and
that
for
the
present
he
ca
come
and
go
as
he
likes
but
he
has
still
got
a
father
heart
joe
and
there
are
times
when
he
worries
about
his
family
and
about
there
being
no
one
with
them
to
keep
an
eye
on
them
and
see
they
grow
up
a
credit
to
him
he
has
been
particularly
worried
about
you
joe
so
when
i
was
coming
away
he
asked
me
to
look
you
up
if
i
had
time
and
let
him
know
how
you
was
getting
on
seeing
that
none
of
his
family
has
gone
near
him
for
a
matter
of
three
years
or
so
though
there
is
one
regular
visiting
day
each
week
i
do
want
to
see
him
no
more
said
joe
he
no
good
that
a
nice
way
for
a
boy
to
talk
about
his
own
father
said
kemp
in
a
reproving
tone
i
do
know
what
the
young
generation
is
coming
to
if
you
want
to
send
him
word
about
me
you
can
tell
him
that
i
not
going
to
be
a
thief
said
joe
defiantly
no
said
kemp
tauntingly
you
sooner
be
a
nark
yes
i
would
said
the
boy
and
that
what
you
are
now
declared
the
man
wrathfully
you
a
nark
for
that
fellow
crewe
i
know
all
about
you
i
earning
an
honest
living
said
joe
as
a
nark
said
kemp
with
a
sneer
i
earning
an
honest
living
said
the
boy
doggedly
so
much
of
his
youth
had
been
spent
among
the
criminal
classes
that
he
still
retained
the
feeling
that
there
was
an
indelible
stigma
attached
to
those
individuals
described
as
narks
how
can
any
one
earn
a
respectable
honest
living
by
being
a
nark
asked
kemp
contemptuously
and
more
than
that
it
one
of
the
best
men
that
ever
breathed
that
you
are
on
i
have
you
know
that
a
friend
of
mine
that
is
to
say
he
done
things
for
me
that
i
likely
to
forget
there
nothing
i
wo
do
for
him
if
the
chance
comes
my
way
i
see
that
no
harm
happens
to
him
through
you
and
your
crewe
you
got
to
stop
this
here
spying
stop
it
at
once
do
you
understand
for
if
you
do
by
god
i
deal
with
you
so
that
do
no
more
spying
in
this
world
and
i
have
you
and
your
master
know
that
i
a
man
what
means
what
he
says
kemp
shook
his
fist
angrily
at
joe
as
he
moved
away
to
the
door
of
the
loft
after
having
delivered
his
menacing
warning
my
last
words
to
you
is
stop
it
he
said
as
he
turned
to
go
down
the
stairs
half
an
hour
later
kemp
entered
the
lounge
of
verney
hotel
as
though
in
quest
of
some
one
most
of
the
hotel
guests
had
finished
their
coffee
and
liqueurs
and
the
hall
was
comparatively
empty
but
a
few
who
remained
raised
their
eyes
in
protest
at
the
intrusion
of
a
member
of
the
lower
orders
into
the
corridor
of
an
exclusive
hotel
kemp
felt
somewhat
out
of
place
and
he
stared
about
the
luxuriously
furnished
lounge
with
a
look
in
which
awe
mingled
with
admiration
before
he
could
advance
further
a
liveried
porter
of
massive
proportions
came
up
to
him
and
barred
the
way
now
now
my
man
said
the
porter
haughtily
what
do
you
think
you
are
doing
here
this
ai
your
place
you
know
you
made
a
mistake
out
you
go
i
want
to
see
holymead
said
kemp
in
a
gruff
voice
verney
was
such
a
hotel
that
persons
seldom
dared
to
put
a
foot
within
the
palatial
entrance
the
porter
unused
to
dealing
with
the
obtrusive
impecunious
type
to
which
he
believed
kemp
to
belong
made
the
mistake
of
trying
to
argue
with
him
want
to
see
mr
holymead
he
repeated
how
do
you
know
he
here
who
told
you
what
do
you
want
to
see
him
for
what
that
got
to
do
with
you
retorted
kemp
you
do
think
holymead
would
like
me
to
discuss
his
business
with
the
likes
of
you
that
ai
what
you
here
for
you
go
and
tell
holymead
that
some
one
wants
to
see
him
tell
him
kemp
wants
to
see
him
kemp
drew
himself
up
and
buttoned
the
coat
of
his
faded
serge
suit
the
porter
uncertain
how
to
deal
with
the
situation
looked
around
for
help
the
manager
of
the
hotel
emerged
from
the
booking
office
at
that
moment
and
the
porter
appealing
look
was
seen
by
him
the
manager
approached
he
was
faultlessly
attired
suave
in
demeanour
and
walked
with
a
noiseless
step
despite
his
tendency
to
corpulence
it
was
his
daily
task
to
wrestle
with
some
of
the
manifold
difficulties
arising
out
of
the
eccentricities
of
human
nature
as
exhibited
by
a
constant
stream
of
arriving
and
departing
guests
but
though
he
approached
the
distressed
porter
with
full
confidence
in
his
ability
to
deal
with
any
situation
his
eyebrows
arched
in
astonishment
as
he
took
in
the
full
details
of
the
intruder
attire
what
does
this
mean
hawkins
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
disapproval
the
porter
trembled
at
the
implication
that
he
had
grievously
failed
in
his
duty
by
allowing
such
an
individual
as
kemp
to
get
so
far
within
the
exclusive
portals
of
verney
and
in
his
nervousness
he
relaxed
from
the
polish
of
the
hotel
porter
to
his
native
cockney
this
party
says
wants
to
see
holymead
sir
the
manager
went
through
the
motion
of
washing
a
spotlessly
clean
pair
of
hands
and
then
brought
the
palms
together
in
a
gentle
clap
he
smiled
pityingly
at
hawkins
and
then
looked
condescendingly
at
kemp
wants
to
see
holymead
does
he
he
said
transferring
his
glance
to
the
worried
porter
and
did
you
tell
him
that
holymead
has
gone
to
the
theatre
and
wo
be
back
for
some
considerable
time
that
a
lie
said
kemp
who
had
acquired
none
of
the
art
of
dealing
with
his
fellow
men
and
was
too
uneducated
to
appreciate
art
in
any
form
i
been
watching
over
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
i
saw
him
passing
a
window
not
ten
minutes
ago
i
going
to
see
him
if
i
wait
here
all
night
i
soon
make
meself
comfortable
on
one
of
them
big
chairs
he
pointed
to
an
empty
chair
beside
a
man
in
evening
dress
who
was
holding
a
conversation
with
a
haughty
looking
matron
you
tell
holymead
kemp
wants
to
see
him
he
said
to
the
manager
what
name
did
you
say
asked
the
manager
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
express
astonishment
that
the
lower
orders
had
names
kemp
you
tell
him
kemp
wants
to
see
him
on
important
business
he
walked
towards
the
vacant
chair
and
seated
himself
on
it
he
dug
his
toes
into
the
velvet
pile
carpet
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
trying
to
take
anchor
fortunately
the
man
on
the
adjoining
chair
and
the
haughty
matron
were
so
engrossed
in
their
conversation
that
they
did
not
notice
that
the
air
in
their
immediate
vicinity
was
being
polluted
by
the
presence
of
a
man
in
shabby
clothes
and
heavy
boots
the
manager
despatched
the
porter
in
search
of
holymead
and
then
went
in
pursuit
of
kemp
will
you
come
this
way
if
you
please
mr
kemp
he
said
with
a
low
bow
he
saw
that
kemp
was
following
him
and
led
the
way
into
an
unfrequented
corner
of
the
smoking
room
where
with
the
information
that
holymead
would
come
to
him
in
a
few
moments
he
asked
kemp
to
be
seated
the
manager
withdrew
a
few
yards
and
then
took
up
a
position
which
enabled
him
to
guard
the
hotel
guests
from
having
their
digestions
interfered
with
by
the
contaminating
spectacle
of
a
seedy
man
to
the
manager
great
relief
holymead
appeared
having
been
informed
by
the
hall
porter
that
a
party
who
said
his
name
was
kemp
had
asked
to
see
him
the
manager
hurried
towards
holymead
and
endeavoured
to
explain
and
apologise
but
the
assured
him
that
there
was
nothing
to
apologise
for
he
went
over
to
the
corner
of
the
smoking
room
where
the
visitor
who
had
caused
so
much
perturbation
was
waiting
for
him
well
kemp
what
do
you
want
there
was
nothing
in
his
manner
to
indicate
that
he
was
put
out
by
kemp
appearance
he
spoke
in
quiet
even
tones
such
as
would
seem
to
suggest
that
he
was
well
acquainted
with
his
visitor
can
i
speak
to
you
on
the
quiet
for
a
moment
sir
whispered
kemp
hoarsely
holymead
looked
round
the
room
the
manager
had
gone
back
to
the
booking
office
and
hawkins
had
vanished
the
few
people
who
were
in
the
room
seemed
occupied
with
their
own
affairs
no
one
will
overhear
us
if
we
speak
quietly
he
said
as
he
took
a
seat
close
to
kemp
what
is
it
you
watched
and
followed
sir
said
kemp
in
a
whisper
somebody
has
been
watching
this
place
for
days
past
and
whenever
you
go
out
followed
by
whom
asked
holymead
by
a
varmint
of
a
boy
a
slippery
young
imp
whose
father
in
gaol
for
a
long
stretch
i
got
hold
of
him
this
afternoon
and
told
him
what
do
to
him
if
he
kept
on
with
his
game
he
living
in
an
old
loft
at
the
back
of
the
hotel
garage
and
he
keeps
a
watch
on
you
day
and
night
i
thought
i
better
come
here
and
tell
you
as
you
know
about
him
you
did
quite
right
kemp
what
this
boy
like
an
undersized
brat
with
a
big
head
he
about
fourteen
or
fifteen
i
should
say
who
is
he
do
you
know
him
leaver
is
the
name
sir
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
know
him
as
well
as
i
know
his
father
his
father
is
a
for
manslaughter
known
him
both
in
and
out
of
gaol
and
when
i
was
coming
out
four
months
ago
bob
leaver
this
here
boy
father
asked
me
to
look
up
his
family
and
send
him
word
about
them
i
went
to
the
address
bob
told
me
in
islington
but
i
found
they
had
all
gone
the
mother
was
dead
and
the
kids
a
girl
and
this
here
boy
had
cleared
out
the
old
jew
who
had
the
clothes
shop
leaver
used
to
keep
told
me
that
the
boy
had
gone
off
with
that
private
detective
crewe
more
than
two
years
ago
so
it
looks
to
me
as
if
he
has
turned
nark
and
crewe
has
put
him
on
to
watch
you
can
you
describe
this
boy
more
closely
well
sir
i
do
know
if
i
can
say
anything
more
about
him
except
that
he
has
red
hair
and
big
bright
eyes
that
are
too
large
for
his
face
i
thought
so
said
holymead
as
if
speaking
to
himself
it
the
same
boy
what
did
you
say
sir
asked
kemp
nothing
kemp
except
that
i
think
i
seen
a
boy
of
this
description
hanging
about
the
street
near
the
hotel
holymead
rose
to
his
feet
as
he
spoke
as
an
indication
that
the
interview
was
at
an
end
kemp
got
up
and
looked
at
him
anxiously
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
for
coming
here
he
said
fumbling
with
the
rim
of
his
hat
as
he
spoke
i
did
know
how
you
take
it
but
i
hope
done
right
they
did
want
to
let
me
see
you
you
did
quite
right
kemp
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
he
was
feeling
in
his
pocket
for
silver
but
kemp
stopped
him
no
no
sir
i
do
want
to
be
paid
anything
i
wanted
to
oblige
you
like
i
wanted
to
do
you
a
good
turn
i
do
anything
for
you
sir
you
know
i
would
i
believe
you
would
kemp
good
night
good
night
sir
as
kemp
passed
down
the
hall
he
met
the
manager
who
was
obviously
pleased
to
see
such
an
unwelcome
visitor
making
his
departure
kemp
scowled
at
the
manager
as
if
he
were
a
valued
patron
of
the
hotel
and
said
it
seems
to
me
that
you
do
know
how
to
treat
people
properly
when
they
come
here
chapter
xxvi
it
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
holymead
had
visited
her
husband
chambers
in
the
middle
temple
mattingford
who
had
been
holymead
clerk
for
nearly
twenty
years
seemed
to
realise
that
the
visit
was
important
though
as
a
married
man
he
knew
that
a
meeting
between
husband
and
wife
in
town
was
usually
so
commonplace
as
to
verge
on
boredom
for
the
husband
there
were
occasions
when
he
had
to
meet
mattingford
but
these
meetings
were
generally
for
the
purpose
of
handing
over
to
the
lady
her
weekly
dress
allowance
of
ten
shillings
out
of
his
salary
so
that
she
might
attend
the
sales
at
the
big
drapery
shops
in
the
west
end
and
inspect
the
windows
containing
expensive
articles
that
she
could
not
hope
to
buy
mattingford
was
an
exceedingly
thrifty
man
and
his
wife
possessed
some
of
the
qualities
of
a
spendthrift
thus
it
came
about
that
mattingford
kept
up
the
fiction
that
he
had
no
savings
and
that
each
week
salary
must
see
him
through
till
the
next
week
mattingford
knew
that
her
husband
had
saved
money
and
theoretically
she
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
know
how
much
she
repeatedly
accused
him
of
being
a
miser
but
this
is
a
wifely
denunciation
which
in
all
classes
of
life
is
lightly
made
when
the
purchase
of
feminine
finery
is
under
discussion
there
are
some
men
who
resent
it
but
mattingford
was
not
one
of
these
protests
and
prayers
abuse
and
cajolery
were
alike
powerless
to
win
his
consent
to
his
wife
perpetual
proposal
that
she
should
be
allowed
to
draw
her
dress
allowance
for
some
months
or
even
some
weeks
ahead
mattingford
had
a
horror
of
bad
debts
he
endeavoured
to
show
his
wife
that
the
transaction
she
proposed
was
unsound
from
a
business
point
of
view
and
reckless
from
a
legal
point
of
view
she
had
no
security
to
offer
for
the
repayment
of
the
advance
even
if
he
were
in
a
financial
position
to
make
the
advance
and
he
stoutly
declared
that
he
was
not
she
might
die
at
any
moment
and
then
he
would
be
left
with
no
means
of
redress
against
her
estate
because
she
had
no
estate
of
course
if
she
first
insured
her
life
out
of
her
dress
allowance
and
handed
the
policy
to
him
it
would
constitute
protection
for
the
repayment
of
the
advance
in
the
event
of
her
death
but
it
was
not
any
real
protection
in
the
event
of
her
continuing
to
live
for
a
policy
had
no
surrender
value
as
his
own
legal
adviser
mattingford
strongly
urged
himself
not
to
consider
his
wife
proposal
and
such
was
his
respect
for
the
law
and
for
those
who
had
been
brought
up
in
a
legal
atmosphere
that
he
had
no
hesitation
in
accepting
the
advice
he
was
a
little
man
of
nearly
fifty
years
with
a
very
bald
head
and
an
extremely
long
moustache
which
when
waxed
at
the
ends
made
him
look
as
fierce
as
a
clipped
poodle
he
knew
holymead
from
his
having
called
frequently
at
his
chief
house
in
princes
gate
on
business
matters
and
he
admired
her
for
her
good
looks
but
still
more
for
her
good
taste
in
staying
away
from
her
husband
chambers
there
were
some
ladies
the
wives
of
barristers
who
almost
haunted
their
husbands
chambers
a
practice
of
which
mattingford
strongly
disapproved
it
seemed
to
him
an
insidious
attempt
on
the
part
of
an
insidious
sex
to
force
the
legal
profession
to
throw
open
its
doors
to
women
as
a
man
who
lived
in
the
mouldy
atmosphere
of
precedent
mattingford
hated
the
idea
of
change
and
to
him
the
thought
of
a
lady
in
wig
and
gown
pleading
in
the
law
courts
indicated
not
merely
change
but
a
revolution
which
might
well
usher
in
the
end
of
the
world
so
strict
was
he
in
keeping
the
precincts
of
the
law
sacred
from
the
violating
tread
of
women
that
he
never
allowed
his
wife
to
set
foot
in
the
middle
temple
their
meetings
on
those
urgent
occasions
when
mattingford
came
to
town
for
her
dress
allowance
in
order
to
go
took
place
at
one
of
the
cheap
tearooms
in
fleet
street
although
mattingford
was
somewhat
flustered
by
the
unexpected
appearance
of
holymead
he
did
not
depart
from
precedent
to
the
extent
of
regarding
her
as
entitled
to
any
other
treatment
than
that
accorded
to
clients
who
called
on
business
he
asked
her
if
she
wanted
to
see
holymead
placed
a
chair
for
her
then
knocked
deferentially
at
his
chief
door
went
inside
to
announce
holymead
to
her
husband
and
came
out
with
the
information
that
holymead
would
see
her
he
held
open
the
door
leading
into
his
chief
private
room
and
after
holymead
had
entered
closed
it
softly
and
firmly
but
the
formal
business
manner
of
mattingford
to
his
chief
wife
seemed
to
her
friendly
and
cordial
compared
with
the
strained
greetings
she
received
from
her
husband
he
motioned
her
to
a
chair
and
then
got
up
from
his
own
i
wrote
to
you
to
come
and
see
me
here
instead
of
going
to
the
house
to
see
you
he
said
because
i
thought
it
would
be
better
for
both
it
would
have
given
the
servants
something
to
talk
about
i
hope
you
do
mind
she
looked
at
him
with
her
large
dark
eyes
in
which
there
was
more
than
a
suggestion
of
tears
what
she
had
read
into
his
note
when
she
received
it
was
his
determination
not
to
go
to
his
home
to
see
her
for
fear
she
would
interpret
that
as
a
first
step
towards
reconciliation
what
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
is
this
detective
crewe
whom
miss
fewbanks
has
employed
in
connection
with
her
father
death
he
continued
her
breath
came
quickly
at
this
unwelcome
information
she
noted
that
he
had
spoken
of
sir
horace
death
and
not
his
murder
he
began
pacing
backwards
and
forwards
across
the
room
as
if
with
the
purpose
of
avoiding
looking
at
her
this
man
crewe
is
a
nuisance
i
might
even
say
a
danger
i
do
know
what
he
has
found
out
but
i
object
to
his
ferreting
into
my
affairs
he
must
be
stopped
she
nodded
her
assent
for
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
speak
each
time
he
turned
his
back
on
her
as
he
crossed
the
room
her
eyes
followed
him
but
as
he
faced
her
she
turned
her
gaze
on
the
floor
there
is
no
legal
redress
no
legal
means
of
dealing
with
his
impertinent
curiosity
he
went
on
he
is
within
his
rights
in
trying
to
find
out
all
he
can
but
if
he
is
allowed
to
go
on
unchecked
the
thing
may
reach
a
disastrous
stage
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
knows
that
i
was
at
riversbrook
the
night
that
man
was
killed
he
was
not
long
in
getting
on
the
track
of
that
and
the
more
mysterious
my
visit
seems
to
him
and
the
fact
that
i
have
not
disclosed
to
the
police
that
i
went
up
to
riversbrook
and
saw
sir
horace
on
the
night
of
the
tragedy
is
to
his
way
of
thinking
very
significant
the
more
reason
is
there
for
suspecting
me
of
complicity
in
the
crime
when
he
turned
to
cross
the
room
her
eyes
lingered
on
him
and
she
glanced
quickly
at
his
face
i
do
want
to
dwell
on
matters
that
must
pain
you
that
must
pain
us
both
he
said
slowly
but
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
be
made
acquainted
with
the
danger
that
threatens
me
from
this
man
i
am
anxious
to
avoid
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
public
scandal
i
am
anxious
quite
as
much
if
not
more
on
your
account
than
my
own
but
if
this
wretched
man
is
allowed
to
go
on
trying
to
build
up
a
case
against
me
and
i
must
admit
that
he
would
probably
obtain
circumstantial
evidence
of
a
kind
which
would
make
some
sort
of
a
case
for
the
prosecution
there
is
grave
danger
of
everything
coming
out
if
he
went
to
the
length
of
having
me
arrested
and
charged
with
the
crime
there
are
bound
to
be
some
disclosures
and
the
newspapers
would
make
the
most
of
them
it
is
impossible
to
foresee
the
exact
nature
of
them
but
i
do
not
see
how
i
could
adopt
any
line
of
defence
which
would
not
hint
at
things
that
are
best
unrevealed
you
yourself
might
be
so
as
to
tell
the
whole
story
in
the
end
of
course
i
would
try
to
prevent
you
and
as
far
as
the
trial
is
concerned
i
think
i
could
use
means
to
prevent
you
but
if
the
result
was
unfavourable
and
knowing
what
eccentric
things
juries
do
we
must
recognise
the
possibility
of
an
unfavourable
verdict
you
might
consider
it
advisable
to
disclose
everything
in
the
hope
of
having
the
conviction
quashed
by
an
appeal
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
sat
down
he
looked
at
her
and
as
he
caught
her
upward
gaze
he
flushed
i
would
tell
everything
if
you
were
arrested
she
said
in
a
low
voice
ah
so
i
thought
he
said
in
a
tone
of
disapproval
the
question
now
is
what
means
can
be
adopted
to
prevent
a
catastrophe
i
have
thought
earnestly
about
it
and
as
you
are
almost
as
much
concerned
in
preventing
public
disclosures
as
i
am
i
desired
to
consult
you
before
taking
any
definite
course
it
is
this
man
crewe
who
is
the
danger
and
the
question
is
how
are
we
to
stop
him
proceeding
to
extremes
one
way
is
for
me
to
see
him
and
take
him
into
my
confidence
to
explain
fully
to
him
what
happened
he
would
not
be
satisfied
with
less
than
the
full
story
if
i
kept
anything
back
his
suspicions
would
remain
in
fact
they
would
be
strengthened
i
would
have
to
explain
to
him
why
and
how
i
induced
sir
horace
to
return
unexpectedly
from
scotland
on
that
fatal
night
and
what
took
place
at
riversbrook
you
will
understand
why
i
have
hesitated
to
adopt
that
course
i
would
not
suggest
it
to
you
now
except
that
i
see
it
would
save
you
from
the
danger
of
something
a
great
deal
worse
of
course
it
would
save
me
from
the
annoyance
of
being
suspected
of
knowing
something
about
the
actual
murder
but
it
is
your
interests
that
come
first
in
the
matter
it
would
be
effective
in
putting
an
end
to
all
our
fears
all
my
fears
i
would
bind
him
to
secrecy
of
course
i
do
not
ask
you
to
come
to
a
decision
immediately
but
i
do
ask
you
to
think
it
over
and
let
me
know
i
have
been
extremely
reluctant
to
put
this
proposal
before
you
because
i
should
hate
carrying
it
out
because
i
should
hate
telling
this
man
of
things
which
are
really
no
concern
of
anyone
but
ourselves
but
i
can
not
disguise
from
myself
that
it
would
remove
a
greater
danger
i
believe
the
secret
would
be
safe
with
him
i
understand
that
in
private
life
he
is
a
gentleman
and
that
i
would
be
safe
in
taking
his
word
of
honour
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
him
to
tell
the
police
still
less
to
tell
miss
fewbanks
is
there
no
other
way
she
asked
have
you
thought
of
any
other
way
yes
the
only
other
way
out
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
is
for
me
to
see
miss
fewbanks
and
ask
her
to
withdraw
the
case
from
crewe
i
would
not
tell
her
everything
i
would
not
bring
you
into
it
at
all
but
i
could
tell
her
that
i
had
had
an
urgent
matter
to
discuss
with
her
father
that
he
came
from
scotland
to
discuss
it
with
me
and
that
after
i
left
him
he
was
murdered
i
would
tell
her
that
it
was
quite
impossible
for
me
to
disclose
what
the
business
was
about
but
that
crewe
having
learnt
that
i
had
seen
her
father
that
night
was
extremely
suspicious
i
would
ask
her
to
accept
my
word
of
honour
that
i
had
no
knowledge
of
who
killed
her
father
and
to
relieve
me
of
the
annoyance
of
the
attentions
of
this
man
crewe
i
think
she
would
agree
to
that
proposal
that
is
the
other
way
out
and
from
something
which
has
happened
this
morning
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
it
is
the
better
and
quicker
course
to
pursue
she
was
thinking
so
deeply
that
she
did
not
reply
at
length
she
became
conscious
of
a
long
silence
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
ask
my
opinion
to
consult
with
me
at
all
it
is
you
that
have
everything
at
stake
i
would
like
to
do
my
best
but
i
think
if
you
gave
me
time
is
there
any
great
urgency
two
days
at
most
is
all
i
want
i
can
not
give
you
two
days
he
replied
with
a
sombre
smile
you
must
decide
at
once
otherwise
it
will
be
too
late
she
looked
at
him
with
parted
lips
and
alarm
in
her
eyes
what
do
you
mean
she
breathed
what
have
you
hidden
is
the
danger
immediate
i
think
so
for
some
days
past
my
movements
have
been
dogged
by
a
boy
in
crewe
employ
nearly
a
week
ago
i
decided
after
the
worry
and
anxiety
of
this
this
unhappy
affair
to
go
away
for
a
short
trip
i
thought
a
to
america
and
back
might
do
me
good
and
fit
me
for
my
work
again
he
sighed
unconsciously
and
went
on
crewe
has
become
acquainted
with
my
intended
departure
and
has
placed
his
own
interpretation
on
it
he
assumes
that
i
am
seeking
safety
in
flight
that
i
have
no
intention
of
coming
back
to
england
the
result
has
been
that
the
boy
crewe
had
set
to
watch
my
movements
has
been
replaced
by
two
men
from
scotland
yard
one
watching
these
chambers
from
the
front
and
the
other
from
the
rear
he
walked
across
to
the
window
and
glanced
quickly
through
the
curtain
yes
they
are
still
here
she
sprang
from
her
seat
and
followed
him
to
the
window
where
are
they
she
gasped
show
them
to
me
there
do
not
move
the
curtain
or
they
will
suspect
we
are
watching
them
look
a
little
to
the
left
by
the
the
other
you
can
catch
a
glimpse
of
if
you
look
between
those
two
trees
what
does
it
mean
why
are
they
waiting
she
burst
out
her
face
had
gone
very
pale
and
her
big
dark
eyes
glared
affrightedly
from
the
window
to
her
husband
hush
i
beg
you
not
to
lose
your
it
is
essential
neither
of
us
should
lose
our
heads
he
said
warningly
she
regained
command
of
herself
with
an
effort
and
whispered
rather
than
spoke
with
twitching
lips
what
does
the
presence
of
these
men
mean
it
means
that
crewe
has
already
communicated
with
scotland
yard
and
that
you
will
be
arrested
for
murder
her
trembling
lips
could
hardly
frame
the
words
i
think
so
it
almost
certain
but
apparently
the
warrant
is
not
yet
issued
or
those
men
would
come
here
and
arrest
me
but
they
are
watching
to
prevent
my
escape
if
i
thought
of
escaping
we
may
yet
have
a
few
hours
to
arrange
something
but
you
must
come
to
a
prompt
decision
tell
me
what
to
do
and
i
will
do
it
oh
let
me
help
you
if
i
can
what
is
the
best
thing
to
do
to
see
crewe
no
i
forbid
you
to
see
crewe
he
said
harshly
if
we
decide
on
that
course
i
will
see
him
myself
and
you
may
be
arrested
the
moment
you
go
out
of
these
chambers
she
returned
oh
no
no
that
is
not
a
good
plan
we
have
not
the
time
i
will
go
to
mabel
fewbanks
at
once
and
beg
her
for
all
our
sakes
not
to
allow
this
to
go
any
further
he
shook
his
head
you
must
not
sacrifice
yourself
he
said
that
would
be
foolish
i
will
not
sacrifice
myself
i
would
tell
her
just
what
you
have
told
me
that
her
father
came
from
scotland
to
discuss
an
urgent
matter
with
you
and
that
he
was
murdered
after
you
left
i
feel
certain
this
man
crewe
is
going
to
extremes
without
her
knowledge
or
consent
and
that
she
will
be
the
first
to
bury
this
awful
thing
when
she
learns
that
you
have
been
implicated
is
not
this
the
best
thing
to
do
it
is
he
reluctantly
admitted
but
i
do
not
wish
you
to
be
mixed
up
in
it
at
all
i
am
not
mixing
myself
up
in
it
i
am
too
selfish
for
that
but
i
swear
to
you
if
you
do
not
let
me
do
this
i
will
confess
everything
i
know
mabel
fewbanks
and
i
repeat
she
is
not
aware
of
what
this
man
crewe
has
done
she
would
not
will
not
permit
it
i
shall
go
down
to
dellmere
at
once
her
face
was
pale
and
her
eyes
glittered
as
she
looked
at
her
husband
but
she
spoke
with
unnatural
with
feverish
energy
she
pulled
on
a
glove
she
had
taken
off
when
she
entered
and
buttoned
it
i
will
i
shall
arrive
in
time
in
two
hours
in
three
at
most
you
will
hear
from
me
she
passed
out
into
the
outer
office
before
her
husband
could
reply
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
mattingford
dashed
to
open
the
outer
door
of
his
room
leading
into
the
main
staircase
he
thought
holymead
looked
strange
as
she
passed
him
and
descended
the
stairs
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
gleefully
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
she
had
come
in
for
a
cheque
for
as
an
advance
of
her
dress
allowance
and
that
her
request
had
been
refused
chapter
xxvii
she
left
her
husband
chambers
with
her
brain
in
a
whirl
hardly
knowing
where
she
was
going
until
she
found
herself
held
up
with
a
stream
of
pedestrians
at
the
island
intersection
of
waterloo
bridge
and
the
strand
she
thought
the
policeman
who
was
regulating
the
traffic
eyed
her
curiously
and
more
with
the
object
of
evading
his
eye
than
with
any
set
plan
in
her
mind
she
stepped
into
an
empty
which
was
waiting
to
cross
the
street
where
to
asked
the
driver
where
to
she
repeated
vacantly
with
an
effort
of
will
she
concentrated
her
thoughts
on
the
task
in
front
of
her
and
hastily
added
to
victoria
as
quick
as
you
can
no
wait
driver
first
take
me
to
the
nearest
bookstall
the
took
her
to
a
bookstall
in
the
strand
where
she
got
out
and
purchased
a
railway
guide
as
the
proceeded
towards
victoria
she
hastily
turned
the
pages
to
the
trains
for
dellmere
she
had
never
been
to
dellmere
but
she
had
heard
from
miss
fewbanks
that
her
father
place
was
reached
from
a
station
called
horleydene
on
the
main
line
to
wennesden
and
that
though
there
were
many
through
trains
comparatively
few
stopped
at
horleydene
but
she
was
unused
to
and
found
it
difficult
to
grasp
the
information
she
required
there
was
such
a
bewildering
diversity
of
letters
at
the
head
of
the
lists
of
trains
for
that
line
and
so
many
reference
notes
on
different
pages
to
be
looked
up
before
it
was
possible
to
ascertain
with
any
degree
of
certainty
what
trains
stopped
at
horleydene
on
that
in
her
shaken
frame
of
mind
with
the
necessity
for
hurry
haunting
her
she
became
confused
and
failed
to
comprehend
the
perplexing
figures
she
signalled
to
the
driver
to
stop
and
handed
him
the
book
i
can
not
understand
this
she
said
in
an
agitated
way
would
you
find
out
for
me
please
when
the
next
train
leaves
victoria
for
horleydene
the
driver
consulted
the
with
a
businesslike
air
the
next
train
leaves
at
he
informed
her
after
that
there
is
another
one
stopping
there
till
holymead
consulted
her
watch
anxiously
it
almost
twelve
now
can
you
catch
the
she
asked
the
driver
looked
dubious
i
try
but
it
take
some
doing
it
depends
whether
i
get
a
clear
run
at
trafalgar
square
try
try
she
cried
catch
it
and
i
will
double
your
fare
she
caught
the
train
with
a
few
seconds
to
spare
she
had
a
compartment
to
herself
and
as
the
train
rushed
out
of
london
and
the
grimy
environs
of
the
metropolis
gradually
gave
place
to
green
fields
she
endeavoured
to
compose
her
mind
and
collect
her
thoughts
for
her
coming
interview
with
the
daughter
of
the
murdered
man
but
her
mind
was
in
such
a
distraught
condition
that
she
could
think
of
no
plan
but
to
sacrifice
herself
in
order
to
save
her
husband
with
cold
hands
pressed
against
her
hot
forehead
she
muttered
again
and
again
as
if
offering
up
an
invocation
that
gained
force
by
repetition
i
must
save
him
i
will
tell
her
everything
the
train
ran
into
horleydene
shortly
after
two
and
holymead
was
the
only
passenger
who
alighted
at
the
lonely
little
wayside
station
which
stood
in
a
small
wood
in
a
solitude
as
profound
as
though
it
had
been
in
the
american
prairie
instead
of
the
heart
of
an
english
county
the
only
sign
of
life
was
a
dilapidated
vehicle
with
an
elderly
man
in
charge
which
stood
outside
the
station
yard
all
day
waiting
for
chance
visitors
cab
exclaimed
the
driver
of
this
vehicle
in
an
ingratiating
voice
touching
his
hat
no
thank
you
replied
holymead
i
walk
miss
fewbanks
was
astonished
when
the
parlourmaid
announced
the
arrival
of
holymead
she
hurried
to
the
to
meet
her
visitor
but
the
warm
greeting
she
offered
her
was
checked
by
her
astonishment
at
the
ill
and
worn
appearance
of
her
beautiful
friend
please
do
said
the
visitor
as
she
held
up
a
warning
hand
to
keep
away
a
sisterly
kiss
she
looked
at
miss
fewbanks
with
the
air
of
a
woman
nerving
herself
for
a
desperate
task
and
said
quickly
i
have
dreadful
things
to
tell
you
you
can
never
think
of
me
again
except
with
loathing
with
horror
the
impression
miss
fewbanks
received
was
that
her
visitor
had
taken
leave
of
her
senses
this
impression
was
deepened
by
next
remark
i
want
you
to
save
my
husband
there
was
an
awkward
pause
while
holymead
waited
for
a
reply
and
miss
fewbanks
wondered
what
was
the
best
thing
to
do
say
you
will
save
him
exclaimed
holymead
do
what
you
like
with
me
but
save
him
do
you
think
dear
you
would
be
better
if
you
had
a
rest
and
a
little
sleep
said
miss
fewbanks
i
am
sure
you
could
sleep
if
you
tried
come
upstairs
and
i
make
you
so
comfortable
you
think
i
am
mad
said
the
elder
woman
would
to
god
that
i
was
come
dear
said
miss
fewbanks
coaxingly
she
turned
to
the
door
and
prepared
to
lead
the
way
upstairs
sleep
exclaimed
holymead
bitterly
i
have
not
had
a
peaceful
sleep
since
your
father
was
killed
i
have
been
haunted
day
and
night
i
can
not
sleep
i
know
it
was
a
dreadful
shock
to
you
but
you
must
not
take
it
so
much
to
heart
you
must
see
your
doctor
and
do
what
he
tells
you
holymead
should
send
you
away
at
the
mention
of
her
husband
name
holymead
came
back
to
the
thought
that
had
been
foremost
in
her
mind
will
you
save
him
she
exclaimed
you
know
i
will
do
anything
i
can
for
him
answered
the
girl
gently
her
intention
was
to
humour
her
visitor
for
she
was
quite
sure
that
holymead
was
in
no
danger
will
you
stop
mr
crewe
stop
mr
crewe
miss
fewbanks
repeated
the
words
in
a
tone
that
showed
her
interest
had
been
awakened
stop
him
from
what
stop
him
from
arresting
my
husband
do
you
mean
to
say
that
crewe
thinks
holymead
had
anything
to
do
with
the
murder
of
my
father
if
i
tell
you
everything
will
you
stop
him
oh
mabel
darling
for
the
sake
of
the
past
before
i
came
on
the
scene
to
mar
the
lives
of
both
of
them
will
you
save
him
it
is
i
not
he
who
should
pay
the
penalty
of
this
awful
tragedy
will
you
save
him
tell
me
everything
said
the
girl
firmly
to
the
stricken
wife
there
was
a
promise
in
the
demand
for
light
and
in
broken
phrases
she
poured
out
her
story
of
shame
and
sorrow
with
a
feeling
that
everything
was
falling
away
from
her
the
girl
learnt
from
her
visitor
disconnected
story
that
there
had
been
a
liaison
between
her
murdered
father
and
her
friend
holymead
had
discovered
it
after
sir
horace
had
gone
to
scotland
and
husband
and
wife
were
away
in
the
country
he
was
at
first
distracted
at
finding
that
his
lifelong
friend
had
seduced
his
wife
then
he
made
her
promise
not
to
see
or
communicate
with
sir
horace
until
he
made
up
his
mind
what
course
of
action
to
take
three
days
later
he
caught
an
evening
train
to
london
and
told
her
he
was
not
returning
but
would
write
to
her
it
crossed
her
mind
that
he
had
gone
up
to
london
to
meet
sir
horace
and
in
her
distress
at
the
thought
of
what
might
happen
when
they
met
she
consulted
her
cousin
gabrielle
who
had
always
been
in
her
confidence
gabrielle
had
offered
to
go
to
riversbrook
to
see
if
sir
horace
had
returned
from
scotland
or
was
expected
back
her
train
was
delayed
by
an
accident
and
when
she
arrived
at
riversbrook
it
was
after
ten
she
arrived
a
few
minutes
too
late
to
prevent
the
tragedy
she
found
the
front
door
open
and
the
electric
light
burning
in
the
hall
she
went
up
the
staircase
and
in
the
library
she
found
sir
horace
who
was
lying
on
the
floor
at
the
point
of
death
she
tried
to
lift
him
to
a
sitting
position
but
with
a
convulsive
gasp
he
died
in
her
arms
she
laid
him
down
and
then
looked
hurriedly
around
the
room
with
the
object
of
removing
any
evidence
of
how
or
why
the
crime
had
been
committed
her
main
thought
being
to
save
her
friend
from
the
shame
of
a
public
scandal
she
picked
up
a
revolver
which
was
lying
on
the
floor
near
sir
horace
turned
out
the
lights
in
the
library
and
in
the
hall
so
that
the
house
was
in
darkness
and
then
closed
the
hall
door
after
her
as
she
went
out
but
crewe
had
discovered
in
some
way
that
holymead
had
visited
sir
horace
that
night
only
a
week
ago
gabrielle
had
gone
to
him
and
tried
to
put
him
off
the
track
but
it
was
no
use
the
wretched
woman
made
a
pathetic
appeal
for
her
husband
life
she
deplored
the
sinfulness
which
had
resulted
in
the
tragedy
she
took
on
herself
the
blame
for
it
all
she
had
sent
one
man
to
his
death
and
her
husband
stood
in
peril
of
a
shameful
death
on
the
gallows
but
it
was
in
the
power
of
mabel
to
save
him
on
her
knees
she
pleaded
for
his
life
she
pleaded
to
be
saved
from
the
horror
of
sending
her
husband
to
the
gallows
if
mabel
father
could
make
his
wishes
known
he
too
would
plead
for
the
life
of
the
friend
he
had
betrayed
the
door
opened
and
the
parlourmaid
entered
miss
fewbanks
stepped
quickly
across
the
room
so
that
she
should
not
witness
the
distress
of
holymead
the
servant
handed
her
a
card
and
waited
for
instructions
miss
fewbanks
looked
at
the
card
in
an
agony
of
indecision
then
she
made
up
her
mind
firmly
show
him
into
my
study
she
whispered
to
the
girl
she
returned
to
her
visitor
who
was
sitting
with
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
crewe
has
just
motored
down
she
said
i
will
save
your
husband
if
i
can
chapter
xxviii
she
was
conscious
that
the
revelation
that
her
father
had
been
killed
by
holymead
was
a
less
shock
than
the
revelation
that
her
father
had
dishonoured
the
great
friendship
of
his
life
by
seducing
his
friend
wife
her
father
had
been
dead
three
months
and
her
grief
had
run
its
course
the
shock
caused
by
the
discovery
that
he
had
been
murdered
had
passed
away
and
she
had
begun
to
accept
his
violent
death
as
part
of
her
own
experience
of
life
but
the
discovery
that
he
had
betrayed
his
best
friend
in
a
way
that
a
woman
regards
as
the
most
dishonourable
way
possible
was
a
fresh
revelation
to
her
of
human
infamy
the
knowledge
that
her
father
had
been
a
man
of
immoral
habits
was
not
new
to
her
his
predilection
for
fast
women
had
long
ago
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
him
for
more
than
a
week
at
a
time
but
that
he
had
trampled
in
the
mire
the
lifelong
friendship
of
an
honourable
man
for
the
sake
of
an
ignoble
passion
revealed
an
unexpected
depth
of
shame
that
holymead
had
killed
him
seemed
almost
a
natural
result
of
the
situation
it
was
not
that
she
felt
that
a
just
retribution
had
overtaken
her
father
but
rather
that
she
was
glad
his
shameful
conduct
had
come
to
an
end
as
she
thought
of
her
dead
father
dead
these
three
months
she
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
the
wretched
guilty
woman
who
had
shared
with
him
the
shame
of
his
ignoble
intrigue
had
said
that
if
her
father
could
make
his
wishes
known
he
would
plead
for
the
life
of
the
friend
he
had
dishonoured
but
it
was
not
her
father
plea
for
the
life
of
his
friend
that
would
have
impressed
her
so
much
as
a
plea
to
bury
the
whole
unsavoury
scandal
from
the
light
she
had
promised
to
save
holymead
if
she
could
but
that
promise
had
sprung
less
from
the
spirit
of
mercy
than
from
the
desire
to
save
her
father
name
from
a
scandal
which
would
hold
him
up
to
public
obloquy
she
greeted
crewe
with
friendly
warmth
in
spite
of
the
feeling
of
oppression
caused
by
the
consciousness
of
the
situation
in
front
of
her
he
did
not
sit
down
again
after
greeting
her
but
stood
with
one
hand
resting
on
an
inlaid
chess
table
with
wonderful
carved
red
and
white
japanese
chessmen
ranged
on
each
side
which
he
had
been
examining
when
she
entered
the
room
i
came
down
to
make
my
report
to
you
because
i
think
my
work
is
finished
he
said
you
have
found
out
who
killed
my
father
she
asked
quietly
crewe
had
sufficient
personal
pride
to
feel
a
little
hurt
when
he
saw
the
calm
way
in
which
she
accepted
the
result
of
his
investigations
instead
of
congratulating
him
on
his
success
in
a
difficult
task
i
think
so
he
said
before
i
tell
you
who
it
is
you
must
prepare
yourself
for
a
great
shock
i
know
who
it
is
she
said
mr
holymead
there
was
no
pretence
about
his
astonishment
how
on
earth
did
you
find
out
she
smiled
a
little
at
such
a
revelation
of
his
appreciation
of
his
own
cleverness
in
having
probed
the
mystery
i
did
not
find
it
out
she
said
i
had
to
be
told
and
who
told
you
miss
fewbanks
he
asked
has
he
confessed
to
you
how
long
have
you
known
it
i
have
known
it
only
a
few
minutes
she
said
will
you
tell
me
how
you
got
on
the
track
and
all
you
have
done
i
am
greatly
interested
you
have
been
wonderfully
clever
to
find
out
i
should
never
have
guessed
holymead
had
anything
to
do
with
it
i
should
never
have
thought
it
possible
when
you
have
finished
i
will
tell
you
how
i
came
to
know
the
story
is
extremely
simple
and
sordid
the
fact
that
the
key
of
the
mystery
had
been
in
her
hands
only
a
few
minutes
was
a
solace
to
crewe
as
it
detracted
but
little
from
the
story
he
had
to
tell
of
patient
investigations
extending
over
weeks
he
pieced
together
the
story
of
the
tragedy
as
he
had
unravelled
it
hill
he
said
had
conceived
the
idea
of
blackmailing
her
father
after
he
had
discovered
the
existence
of
some
letters
in
a
secret
drawer
of
sir
horace
desk
the
fact
that
sir
horace
had
kept
these
letters
instead
of
destroying
them
as
he
had
destroyed
other
letters
of
a
somewhat
similar
kind
showed
that
he
was
very
much
infatuated
with
the
lady
who
wrote
them
that
lady
as
doubtless
miss
fewbanks
had
guessed
was
holymead
a
lady
with
whom
sir
horace
had
been
on
very
friendly
terms
before
she
married
holymead
what
became
of
the
letters
asked
miss
fewbanks
have
you
got
them
i
think
they
are
destroyed
he
said
holymead
removed
them
from
the
secret
drawer
the
day
after
the
discovery
of
the
murder
she
removed
them
when
the
police
had
charge
of
the
house
and
almost
from
under
the
eyes
of
inspector
chippenfield
it
was
a
daring
plan
and
well
carried
out
miss
fewbanks
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
on
learning
the
fate
of
the
letters
it
had
been
her
intention
to
endeavour
to
obtain
them
if
they
were
in
crewe
possession
and
destroy
them
crewe
explained
that
hill
was
afraid
to
take
the
letters
and
then
boldly
blackmail
sir
horace
the
butler
conceived
the
plan
of
getting
birchill
to
break
into
the
house
he
did
not
take
birchill
into
his
confidence
with
regard
to
the
blackmailing
scheme
but
in
order
to
induce
sir
horace
to
believe
the
burglar
had
stolen
the
letters
he
told
birchill
to
force
open
the
desk
as
he
would
probably
find
money
or
papers
of
value
there
but
in
order
to
prevent
birchill
getting
the
letters
if
he
should
happen
to
stumble
across
the
secret
drawer
hill
removed
them
the
day
before
his
plan
was
to
go
to
riversbrook
in
the
morning
after
the
burglary
and
after
leaving
open
the
secret
drawer
which
had
contained
the
letters
to
report
the
burglary
to
the
police
when
sir
horace
came
home
unexpectedly
hill
had
just
removed
the
letters
and
had
them
in
his
possession
hill
was
greatly
perturbed
at
his
master
unexpected
return
and
had
to
get
an
opportunity
to
replace
the
letters
in
the
secret
drawer
but
sir
horace
told
him
to
go
home
as
he
was
not
wanted
till
the
morning
hill
went
to
that
girl
flat
in
westminster
and
there
saw
birchill
he
told
birchill
that
sir
horace
had
returned
unexpectedly
but
he
urged
birchill
to
carry
out
the
burglary
as
arranged
and
assured
him
that
as
sir
horace
was
a
heavy
sleeper
there
would
be
no
risk
if
he
waited
until
sir
horace
went
to
bed
hill
position
was
that
if
the
burglary
was
postponed
sir
horace
might
make
the
discovery
that
the
letters
had
been
stolen
from
the
secret
drawer
in
that
case
sir
horace
would
immediately
suspect
hill
who
he
knew
was
an
it
was
just
possible
that
sir
horace
before
going
to
bed
would
discover
that
the
letters
had
been
stolen
that
is
if
he
went
to
bed
before
birchill
got
into
the
place
but
hill
had
to
take
that
risk
it
was
the
fact
that
the
burglary
hill
had
arranged
with
birchill
took
place
on
the
night
sir
horace
was
killed
that
had
given
rise
to
the
false
clues
which
had
misled
the
police
crewe
as
he
himself
modestly
put
it
was
so
fortunate
as
to
get
on
the
right
track
from
the
start
his
suspicions
were
directed
to
holymead
when
he
saw
the
latter
carrying
away
a
from
riversbrook
after
his
visit
of
condolence
to
miss
fewbanks
crewe
explained
what
tactics
he
had
adopted
to
obtain
a
brief
inspection
of
the
stick
in
order
to
ascertain
for
his
own
satisfaction
if
it
had
belonged
to
holymead
his
suspicions
against
holymead
were
strengthened
when
he
discovered
that
the
latter
when
driving
to
his
hotel
on
the
night
of
the
tragedy
had
thrown
away
a
glove
which
was
the
fellow
of
the
one
found
by
the
police
in
sir
horace
library
the
next
point
to
settle
was
whether
holymead
had
had
anything
to
do
with
your
father
sudden
return
from
scotland
said
crewe
continuing
his
story
if
that
proved
to
be
the
case
and
if
evidence
could
be
obtained
on
which
to
justify
the
conclusion
that
these
two
old
friends
had
had
a
deadly
quarrel
the
circumstantial
evidence
against
holymead
as
the
man
who
killed
your
father
was
very
strong
i
may
say
that
before
i
went
to
scotland
i
came
across
evidence
of
the
estrangement
of
holymead
and
his
wife
do
you
remember
when
you
and
holymead
were
leaving
the
court
after
the
inquest
that
holymead
came
up
and
spoke
to
you
he
shook
hands
with
you
and
was
on
the
point
of
shaking
hands
with
his
wife
as
if
she
were
a
lady
he
had
met
casually
then
on
the
night
of
the
murder
the
driver
at
hyde
park
corner
drove
him
to
his
house
at
princes
gate
but
was
ordered
to
drive
back
and
take
him
to
hotel
all
this
was
interesting
to
me
doubly
interesting
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
sir
horace
had
known
holymead
before
her
second
marriage
and
had
paid
her
every
attention
i
went
to
scotland
and
made
inquiries
at
craigleith
hall
where
sir
horace
had
been
shooting
my
object
was
to
endeavour
to
obtain
a
clue
to
the
reason
for
his
sudden
journey
to
london
the
local
police
had
made
inquiries
on
this
point
on
behalf
of
scotland
yard
and
had
been
unable
to
obtain
any
clue
no
telegram
had
been
received
by
sir
horace
and
he
had
sent
none
of
course
he
had
received
some
letters
he
had
told
none
of
the
other
members
of
the
shooting
party
the
object
of
his
departure
for
london
but
he
had
declared
his
intention
of
being
back
with
them
in
less
than
a
week
it
had
occurred
to
me
when
the
crime
was
discovered
that
his
missing
might
not
have
been
stolen
by
his
murderer
but
might
have
been
lost
in
scotland
i
made
inquiries
in
that
direction
and
eventually
found
that
the
man
who
had
attended
to
sir
horace
on
the
moors
had
the
his
story
was
that
sir
horace
had
lost
it
the
day
before
his
departure
for
london
he
had
taken
off
his
coat
owing
to
the
heat
on
the
moor
and
the
had
dropped
out
he
ascertained
his
loss
before
he
left
for
london
and
told
this
man
sanders
where
he
thought
the
had
dropped
out
sanders
was
to
look
for
it
and
if
he
found
it
was
to
keep
it
until
sir
horace
came
back
he
did
find
it
and
after
learning
of
your
father
death
was
tempted
to
keep
it
as
it
contained
four
notes
sanders
is
an
ignorant
man
and
can
scarcely
read
he
professed
to
know
nothing
of
the
when
i
questioned
him
but
i
became
suspicious
of
him
and
laid
a
trap
which
he
fell
into
then
he
handed
me
the
which
he
had
hidden
on
the
moor
under
a
stone
in
the
i
found
a
letter
from
holymead
asking
your
father
to
come
to
london
at
once
as
there
were
to
be
two
new
appointments
to
the
court
of
appeal
and
that
sir
horace
had
an
excellent
chance
of
obtaining
one
if
he
came
to
london
and
used
his
influence
with
the
chancellor
and
the
chief
justice
who
were
still
in
town
the
writer
indicated
that
he
was
doing
all
that
was
possible
in
sir
horace
interests
and
that
he
would
meet
sir
horace
at
riversbrook
at
on
wednesday
night
and
let
him
know
the
exact
position
there
is
nothing
suspicious
in
such
a
letter
but
my
inquiries
concerning
new
appointments
to
the
court
of
appeal
suggest
that
the
statements
in
the
letter
are
false
now
let
us
consider
the
conduct
of
holymead
and
his
wife
since
the
night
of
the
murder
his
course
of
action
has
not
been
that
of
a
man
anxious
to
assist
the
police
in
the
discovery
of
the
murderer
of
his
old
friend
we
have
first
of
all
his
secrecy
regarding
his
visit
to
riversbrook
that
night
the
fact
of
the
visit
being
established
by
the
stick
and
the
glove
he
left
behind
we
have
the
estrangement
of
husband
and
wife
we
have
holymead
visit
to
riversbrook
on
the
morning
that
the
first
details
of
the
crime
appeared
in
the
newspapers
ostensibly
she
came
to
see
you
and
pay
her
condolences
but
as
she
knew
that
you
had
been
away
in
the
country
she
ought
to
have
telephoned
to
learn
if
you
had
come
up
to
london
instead
of
telephoning
she
went
to
riversbrook
direct
and
when
she
found
you
were
not
there
she
was
admitted
to
the
presence
of
my
old
friend
inspector
chippenfield
he
is
an
excellent
police
officer
but
i
do
not
think
he
is
a
match
for
a
clever
woman
and
holymead
is
such
a
woman
that
i
feel
sure
chippenfield
was
so
impressed
by
her
appearance
that
he
forgot
he
was
a
police
officer
and
remembered
only
that
he
was
a
man
she
managed
to
get
him
out
of
the
room
long
enough
to
enable
her
to
open
the
secret
drawer
in
sir
horace
desk
and
remove
the
letters
no
doubt
sir
horace
had
shown
her
where
he
kept
them
as
their
neat
little
hiding
place
was
an
indication
of
the
value
he
placed
upon
them
she
was
under
the
impression
that
no
one
knew
about
the
letters
and
her
object
in
removing
them
was
to
prevent
the
police
stumbling
across
them
and
so
getting
on
the
track
of
her
husband
but
as
i
have
already
told
you
hill
knew
about
the
letters
and
on
the
night
of
the
murder
had
them
in
his
possession
on
the
night
after
the
murder
while
inspector
chippenfield
was
making
investigations
at
riversbrook
hill
had
managed
to
obtain
the
opportunity
to
put
the
letters
back
he
naturally
thought
that
if
the
police
discovered
some
of
sir
private
papers
in
his
possession
they
would
conclude
that
he
had
had
something
to
do
with
the
murder
the
next
point
of
any
consequence
is
holymead
defence
of
birchill
and
the
deliberate
way
in
which
he
blackened
your
father
name
while
hill
if
we
regard
holymead
conduct
solely
from
the
standpoint
of
a
barrister
doing
his
best
for
his
client
his
defence
of
birchill
is
not
so
remarkable
but
we
have
to
remember
that
your
father
and
holymead
had
been
friends
his
acceptance
of
the
brief
for
the
defence
was
in
itself
remarkable
the
fee
as
i
took
the
trouble
to
find
out
was
not
large
indeed
for
a
man
of
commanding
eminence
at
the
bar
it
might
be
called
a
small
one
and
he
should
have
returned
the
brief
because
the
fee
was
inadequate
we
have
therefore
two
things
to
consider
his
defence
of
the
man
charged
with
the
murder
of
your
father
and
his
readiness
to
do
the
work
without
regard
to
the
monetary
side
of
it
much
was
said
at
the
time
in
some
of
the
papers
about
a
barrister
being
a
servant
of
the
court
and
compelled
by
the
etiquette
of
the
bar
to
place
his
services
at
the
disposal
of
anyone
who
needs
them
and
is
prepared
to
pay
for
them
a
great
deal
of
nonsense
has
been
said
and
written
on
that
subject
a
barrister
can
return
a
brief
because
for
private
reasons
he
does
not
wish
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
case
it
was
holymead
duty
to
do
his
best
to
get
birchill
off
whether
he
believed
his
client
was
guilty
or
innocent
could
holymead
have
done
his
best
for
birchill
if
he
had
believed
that
birchill
was
the
murderer
of
his
lifelong
friend
would
he
have
trusted
himself
to
do
his
best
no
holymead
knew
that
birchill
was
innocent
he
knew
who
the
guilty
man
was
and
knowing
that
knowing
that
his
action
in
defending
the
man
charged
with
the
murder
of
an
old
friend
would
weigh
with
the
jury
he
took
up
the
case
because
he
felt
there
was
a
moral
obligation
on
him
to
get
birchill
off
his
conduct
of
the
defence
during
which
he
attacked
the
moral
character
of
your
father
was
remarkable
coming
from
him
the
friend
of
the
dead
man
as
the
action
of
defending
counsel
it
was
perfectly
legitimate
it
gave
rise
to
some
discussion
in
purely
legal
circles
whether
holymead
did
right
or
wrong
in
violating
a
long
friendship
in
order
to
get
his
man
off
the
academic
point
is
whether
he
ought
to
have
violated
his
personal
feelings
for
an
old
friend
or
violated
his
duty
to
his
client
by
doing
something
less
than
his
best
for
him
apart
from
the
circumstantial
and
inferential
evidence
against
holymead
there
is
the
fact
that
his
wife
knows
that
he
committed
the
crime
her
acts
point
to
that
her
conduct
throughout
springs
from
the
desire
to
shield
him
even
the
removal
of
the
letters
from
the
secret
drawer
was
prompted
more
by
the
desire
to
save
him
than
to
save
herself
their
discovery
would
not
have
been
very
serious
for
her
but
it
would
have
put
the
police
on
her
husband
track
if
i
remember
rightly
she
asked
you
to
keep
her
in
touch
with
all
the
developments
of
the
investigations
of
the
police
and
myself
you
told
me
that
she
was
greatly
interested
in
the
fact
that
i
did
not
believe
birchill
was
guilty
and
particularly
anxious
to
know
if
i
suspected
anyone
at
birchill
trial
she
did
me
the
honour
of
watching
me
very
closely
i
was
watching
both
her
and
her
husband
when
she
discovered
through
her
womanly
intuition
that
i
suspected
her
husband
that
i
was
accumulating
evidence
against
him
she
sent
round
her
friend
mademoiselle
chiron
with
some
interesting
information
for
me
an
extremely
clever
young
woman
that
like
all
her
countrywomen
she
is
wonderfully
sharp
and
quick
with
a
natural
aptitude
for
intrigue
of
course
the
information
she
gave
me
was
intended
to
mislead
me
intended
to
show
me
that
holymead
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
crime
but
some
of
it
was
extremely
interesting
when
it
dealt
with
actual
facts
and
some
of
the
facts
were
quite
new
to
me
for
instance
i
had
not
previously
known
that
a
piece
of
a
lady
handkerchief
was
found
clenched
in
your
father
right
hand
after
he
was
dead
the
police
very
kindly
kept
that
information
from
me
had
they
told
me
about
it
i
might
have
been
inclined
to
suspect
holymead
and
to
believe
that
her
husband
was
trying
to
shield
her
his
conduct
would
bear
that
interpretation
if
she
had
happened
to
be
guilty
the
police
unconsciously
saved
me
from
taking
up
that
false
scent
i
have
detained
you
a
long
time
in
dealing
with
these
points
miss
fewbanks
but
i
wanted
to
make
everything
clear
i
have
all
but
reached
the
end
let
us
take
in
chronological
order
what
happened
on
the
night
of
the
tragedy
we
have
your
father
sudden
return
from
scotland
hill
was
at
riversbrook
when
he
arrived
and
having
the
secret
letters
in
his
possession
was
greatly
perturbed
by
the
unexpected
return
of
sir
horace
he
went
to
doris
fanning
flat
in
westminster
to
see
birchill
in
his
absence
holymead
arrived
it
is
probable
that
he
took
the
tube
from
hyde
park
corner
to
hampstead
and
walked
to
riversbrook
he
rang
the
bell
was
admitted
by
your
father
and
leaving
his
hat
and
stick
in
the
as
he
had
often
done
before
the
two
went
upstairs
to
the
library
there
was
an
angry
interview
holymead
accusing
your
father
of
having
wronged
him
and
demanding
satisfaction
my
own
opinion
is
that
there
was
an
irregular
sort
of
duel
each
of
them
fired
one
shot
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
holymead
in
spite
of
his
mission
being
that
of
revenge
gave
your
father
a
fair
chance
for
his
life
a
man
in
position
would
probably
feel
indifferent
whether
he
killed
the
man
who
had
ruined
his
home
or
was
killed
by
him
but
whereas
your
father
shot
missed
by
a
few
inches
holymead
inflicted
a
fatal
wound
when
he
saw
your
father
fall
and
realised
what
he
had
done
the
instinct
of
asserted
itself
he
grabbed
at
the
gloves
he
had
taken
off
but
in
his
hurry
dropped
one
on
the
floor
he
ran
downstairs
took
his
hat
from
the
but
left
his
stick
then
he
rushed
out
of
the
house
leaving
the
front
door
open
he
made
his
way
back
to
hampstead
tube
station
got
out
at
hyde
park
and
took
a
cab
to
his
hotel
within
a
few
minutes
of
holymead
departure
from
riversbrook
the
frenchwoman
arrived
she
may
have
passed
holymead
in
tanton
gardens
or
holymead
when
he
saw
her
approaching
may
have
hidden
inside
the
gateway
of
a
neighbouring
house
she
had
come
up
from
the
country
on
learning
that
holymead
had
come
to
london
she
caught
the
next
train
but
unfortunately
it
was
late
on
arriving
at
victoria
owing
to
a
slight
accident
to
the
engine
i
take
it
that
she
was
sent
by
holymead
to
follow
her
husband
if
possible
and
see
if
he
had
any
designs
on
sir
horace
she
took
a
cab
as
far
as
the
spaniards
inn
and
then
got
out
and
walked
to
riversbrook
when
she
arrived
at
the
house
she
found
the
front
door
open
and
the
lights
burning
there
was
no
answer
to
her
ring
and
she
entered
the
house
and
crept
upstairs
opening
the
library
door
she
saw
your
father
lying
on
the
floor
she
endeavoured
to
raise
him
to
a
sitting
posture
but
it
was
too
late
to
do
anything
for
him
with
a
convulsive
movement
he
grasped
at
the
handkerchief
she
was
holding
in
one
hand
and
a
corner
of
it
was
torn
off
and
remained
in
his
hand
when
she
saw
he
had
breathed
his
last
she
laid
him
down
on
the
floor
since
she
had
been
too
late
to
prevent
the
crime
the
next
best
thing
in
the
interests
of
holymead
was
to
remove
traces
of
holymead
guilt
she
picked
up
the
revolver
which
she
thought
belonged
to
holymead
turned
off
the
light
in
the
room
went
downstairs
turned
off
the
light
in
the
hall
and
closed
the
hall
door
as
she
went
out
she
behaved
with
remarkable
courage
and
coolness
but
she
overlooked
the
glove
in
the
room
of
the
tragedy
and
holymead
stick
in
the
later
in
the
night
we
have
birchill
entry
into
the
house
his
alarm
at
finding
your
father
had
been
killed
and
his
return
to
the
flat
where
hill
was
waiting
for
him
when
crewe
had
finished
he
looked
at
the
girl
she
had
followed
his
statement
with
breathless
interest
you
have
been
wonderfully
clever
she
said
it
is
perfectly
marvellous
crewe
eyes
had
wandered
to
the
inlaid
and
the
japanese
chessmen
set
in
prim
rows
on
either
side
mechanically
he
began
to
arrange
a
problem
on
the
board
his
interest
in
the
famous
murder
mystery
seemed
to
have
evaporated
i
was
very
fortunate
he
said
absently
in
reply
to
miss
fewbanks
everything
seemed
to
come
right
for
me
you
made
everything
come
right
she
replied
i
do
not
know
how
to
thank
you
for
giving
so
much
of
your
time
to
unravelling
the
mystery
it
was
fascinating
while
it
lasted
he
replied
his
fingers
still
busy
with
the
chessmen
of
course
i
am
pleased
with
my
success
but
in
a
way
i
am
sorry
the
work
has
come
to
an
end
i
thought
that
the
knowledge
that
holymead
was
the
guilty
man
would
come
as
a
great
shock
to
you
but
i
am
glad
you
are
able
to
take
it
so
well
a
few
minutes
before
you
arrived
i
learned
that
it
was
holymead
but
what
has
been
more
of
a
shock
to
me
crewe
is
the
discovery
that
my
father
had
ruined
his
home
oh
crewe
it
is
terrible
for
me
to
have
to
hold
my
dead
father
up
to
judgment
but
it
is
more
terrible
still
to
know
that
he
was
not
faithful
even
to
his
lifelong
friendship
with
mr
holymead
your
nerves
are
unstrung
he
said
you
want
rest
and
quiet
you
want
a
long
sea
voyage
yes
i
want
to
forget
she
said
but
there
are
others
who
want
to
forget
too
can
not
we
bury
the
whole
thing
in
forgetfulness
crewe
growing
interest
in
the
chessboard
and
his
problem
suddenly
vanished
his
eyes
became
instantly
riveted
on
her
face
in
a
keen
questioning
look
what
is
it
to
me
or
you
that
holymead
should
be
publicly
proved
guilty
of
this
terrible
thing
she
went
on
passionately
why
drag
into
the
light
my
father
conduct
in
order
to
make
a
day
sensation
for
the
newspapers
for
his
sake
what
better
thing
could
i
do
than
let
his
memory
rest
do
you
mean
that
holymead
should
be
allowed
to
go
free
he
asked
in
astonishment
yes
i
extremely
sorry
he
said
slowly
wo
you
let
it
all
drop
she
pleaded
i
could
not
take
upon
myself
the
responsibility
of
condoning
such
a
crime
the
responsibility
of
judging
between
your
father
and
his
murderer
he
said
solemnly
but
even
if
i
could
it
is
too
late
to
think
of
doing
so
there
is
already
a
warrant
out
for
holymead
arrest
chapter
xxix
the
newspapers
made
a
sensation
out
of
the
announcement
of
arrest
on
a
charge
of
having
murdered
sir
horace
fewbanks
they
declared
that
the
arrest
of
the
eminent
on
a
capital
charge
would
come
as
a
surprising
development
of
the
riversbrook
case
it
would
cause
a
shock
to
his
many
friends
and
especially
to
those
who
knew
what
a
close
friendship
had
existed
between
the
arrested
man
and
the
dead
judge
the
papers
expatiated
on
the
fact
that
holymead
had
appeared
for
the
defence
when
frederick
birchill
had
been
tried
for
the
murder
as
the
public
would
remember
birchill
had
been
acquitted
owing
to
the
great
ability
with
which
his
defence
was
conducted
it
was
somewhat
remarkable
said
the
that
in
his
speech
for
the
defence
holymead
had
attempted
to
throw
suspicion
on
one
of
the
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
the
journal
hinted
that
it
was
the
result
of
something
which
counsel
for
the
defence
had
let
drop
at
this
trial
that
inspector
chippenfield
had
picked
up
the
clue
which
had
led
to
holymead
arrest
the
papers
had
very
little
information
to
give
the
public
about
this
new
development
of
the
fewbanks
mystery
but
they
boldly
declared
that
some
startling
revelations
were
expected
when
the
case
came
before
the
court
in
the
absence
of
interesting
facts
apropos
of
the
arrest
of
the
distinguished
some
of
the
papers
published
summaries
of
his
legal
career
and
the
more
famous
cases
with
which
he
had
been
connected
these
summaries
would
have
been
equally
suitable
to
an
announcement
that
holymead
had
been
promoted
to
the
peerage
or
that
he
had
been
run
over
by
a
london
bus
there
were
people
who
declared
without
knowing
anything
about
the
evidence
the
police
had
in
their
possession
that
in
arresting
the
famous
barrister
the
police
had
made
a
far
worse
blunder
than
in
arresting
birchill
it
was
even
hinted
that
the
arrest
of
the
man
who
had
got
birchill
off
was
an
expression
of
the
police
desire
for
revenge
to
these
people
the
acquittal
of
holymead
was
a
foregone
conclusion
the
man
who
had
saved
birchill
life
by
his
brilliant
forensic
abilities
was
not
likely
to
fail
when
his
own
life
was
at
stake
but
when
the
case
came
before
the
police
court
and
the
police
produced
their
evidence
it
was
seen
that
there
was
a
strong
case
against
the
prisoner
the
whispers
as
to
the
circumstances
under
which
the
prisoner
had
taken
the
life
of
a
friend
of
many
years
appealed
to
a
sentimental
public
these
whispers
concerned
the
discovery
by
the
prisoner
that
his
friend
had
seduced
his
beautiful
wife
in
the
police
court
proceedings
there
were
no
disclosures
under
this
head
but
the
thing
was
hinted
at
in
view
of
the
legal
eminence
of
the
prisoner
and
the
fear
of
the
police
that
he
would
prove
too
much
for
any
police
officer
who
might
take
charge
of
the
prosecution
the
direction
of
public
prosecutions
sent
walters
to
appear
at
the
police
court
the
prisoner
was
represented
by
lethbridge
an
eminent
barrister
to
whom
the
prisoner
had
been
opposed
in
many
civil
cases
inspector
chippenfield
who
realised
that
the
important
position
the
prisoner
occupied
at
the
bar
added
to
the
importance
of
the
officer
who
had
arrested
him
gave
evidence
as
to
the
arrest
of
the
prisoner
at
his
chambers
in
the
middle
temple
with
a
generous
feeling
which
was
possibly
due
to
the
fact
that
he
was
entitled
to
none
of
the
credit
of
collecting
the
evidence
against
the
prisoner
inspector
chippenfield
allowed
detective
rolfe
a
subordinate
share
in
the
glory
that
hung
round
the
arrest
by
volunteering
the
information
in
the
that
when
making
the
arrest
he
was
accompanied
by
that
officer
he
declared
that
the
prisoner
made
no
remark
when
arrested
and
did
not
seem
surprised
walters
produced
a
glove
and
witness
duly
identified
it
as
the
glove
which
he
found
in
the
room
in
which
the
murder
took
place
inspector
seldon
gave
formal
evidence
of
the
discovery
of
the
body
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
on
the
of
august
slingsby
repeated
the
evidence
that
he
had
given
at
the
trial
of
birchill
as
to
the
cause
of
death
and
was
again
professionally
indefinite
as
to
the
length
of
time
the
victim
had
been
dead
when
he
saw
the
body
thomas
taylor
driver
gave
evidence
as
to
driving
the
prisoner
from
hyde
park
corner
on
the
night
of
the
of
august
and
the
finding
of
the
glove
crewe
went
into
the
and
swore
that
on
the
second
day
after
the
discovery
of
the
murder
he
was
present
at
riversbrook
when
the
prisoner
visited
the
house
and
saw
miss
fewbanks
when
the
prisoner
arrived
he
was
not
carrying
a
but
he
had
one
in
his
hand
when
he
took
his
departure
from
the
house
witness
followed
the
prisoner
and
a
boy
who
collided
with
the
prisoner
knocked
the
stick
out
of
his
hands
witness
picked
up
the
stick
and
inspected
it
he
identified
the
stick
produced
in
court
as
the
one
which
the
prisoner
had
been
carrying
on
that
day
the
most
difficult
and
most
important
witness
as
far
as
new
evidence
was
concerned
was
alexander
saunders
a
big
broad
scotchman
whose
firm
grasp
on
the
he
held
in
his
hand
seemed
to
indicate
a
fear
that
all
the
pickpockets
in
london
had
designs
on
it
with
great
difficulty
he
was
made
to
understand
his
part
in
the
and
some
of
the
questions
had
to
be
repeated
several
times
before
he
could
grasp
their
meaning
lethbridge
humorously
suggested
that
his
learned
friend
should
have
provided
an
interpreter
so
that
his
pure
english
might
be
translated
into
lowland
scotch
by
slow
degrees
saunders
was
able
to
explain
how
he
had
found
the
which
sir
horace
fewbanks
had
lost
while
shooting
at
craigleith
hall
witness
identified
a
letter
produced
as
having
been
in
the
when
he
found
it
the
letter
which
had
been
written
by
the
prisoner
to
sir
horace
fewbanks
urged
sir
horace
to
return
to
london
at
once
as
if
he
did
so
there
was
a
good
possibility
of
his
obtaining
promotion
to
the
court
of
appeal
the
writer
promised
to
do
all
he
could
in
the
matter
and
to
call
on
sir
horace
at
riversbrook
as
soon
as
he
returned
from
scotland
percival
chambers
an
elderly
man
with
a
grey
beard
and
wearing
glasses
who
was
secretary
of
the
master
of
rolls
swore
that
he
knew
of
no
prospective
vacancies
on
the
court
of
appeal
bench
were
any
vacancies
of
the
kind
in
view
he
believed
he
would
be
aware
of
them
this
closed
the
case
for
the
police
and
lethbridge
immediately
asked
for
the
discharge
of
the
prisoner
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
case
to
go
before
a
jury
the
magistrate
shook
his
head
and
merely
asked
lethbridge
if
he
intended
to
reserve
his
defence
lethbridge
replied
with
a
nod
and
the
accused
was
formally
committed
for
trial
at
the
next
sittings
at
the
old
bailey
the
newspapers
reported
at
great
length
the
evidence
given
in
the
police
court
and
their
reports
were
eagerly
read
by
a
public
even
those
people
who
when
holymead
arrest
was
announced
had
ridiculed
the
idea
of
a
man
like
holymead
murdering
a
lifelong
friend
had
to
admit
that
the
police
had
collected
some
damaging
evidence
those
people
who
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
had
prided
themselves
on
possessing
an
open
mind
as
to
the
guilt
of
the
famous
barrister
confessed
after
reading
the
police
court
evidence
that
there
could
be
little
doubt
of
his
guilt
the
only
thing
that
was
missing
from
the
police
court
proceedings
was
the
production
of
a
motive
for
the
crime
but
it
was
whispered
that
there
would
be
some
interesting
revelations
on
this
point
when
the
prisoner
was
tried
at
the
old
bailey
fortunately
he
had
not
long
to
wait
for
his
trial
as
the
next
sittings
of
the
central
criminal
court
had
previously
been
fixed
a
week
ahead
of
the
date
of
his
commitment
that
week
was
full
of
anxiety
for
lethbridge
for
he
realised
that
he
had
a
poor
case
what
increased
his
anxiety
was
the
fact
that
holymead
insisted
on
the
defence
being
conducted
on
the
lines
he
laid
down
it
was
a
new
thing
in
experience
to
accept
such
instructions
from
a
prisoner
but
holymead
had
threatened
to
dispense
with
all
assistance
unless
his
instructions
were
carried
out
he
was
particularly
anxious
that
his
wife
name
should
be
kept
out
of
court
as
much
as
possible
lethbridge
had
pointed
out
to
him
that
the
prosecution
would
be
sure
to
drag
it
in
at
the
trial
in
suggesting
a
motive
for
the
murder
and
that
for
the
purposes
of
the
defence
it
was
best
to
have
a
full
and
frank
disclosure
of
everything
so
that
an
appeal
could
be
made
to
the
jury
feelings
holymead
beautiful
wife
who
was
almost
distracted
by
her
husband
position
implored
his
counsel
to
allow
her
to
go
into
the
box
and
make
a
confession
but
that
course
did
not
commend
itself
to
lethbridge
who
realised
that
she
would
make
an
extremely
bad
witness
and
would
but
help
to
put
the
rope
round
her
husband
neck
he
put
her
off
by
declaring
that
there
was
a
good
prospect
of
her
husband
being
acquitted
but
that
if
the
verdict
unfortunately
went
against
him
her
confession
would
have
more
weight
in
saving
him
when
the
appeal
against
the
verdict
was
heard
it
amazed
lethbridge
to
find
that
the
prisoner
expressed
the
view
that
birchill
had
committed
the
murder
this
view
was
based
on
his
contention
that
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
alive
when
he
holymead
left
him
about
ten
the
interview
between
them
had
been
an
angry
one
but
holymead
persisted
in
asserting
that
he
had
not
shot
his
former
friend
he
declared
that
he
had
not
taken
a
revolver
with
him
when
he
went
to
riversbrook
lethbridge
was
one
of
those
barristers
who
believe
that
a
knowledge
of
the
guilt
of
a
client
handicapped
counsel
in
defending
him
he
had
his
private
opinion
as
to
the
result
of
the
angry
interview
between
holymead
and
sir
horace
fewbanks
but
he
preferred
that
holymead
should
protest
his
innocence
even
to
him
that
made
it
easier
for
him
to
make
a
stirring
appeal
to
the
jury
than
it
would
have
been
if
his
client
had
fully
confessed
to
him
his
private
opinion
as
to
the
author
of
the
crime
was
strengthened
by
holymead
admission
that
birchill
had
not
confessed
to
him
or
to
his
solicitor
at
the
time
of
his
trial
that
he
had
shot
sir
horace
fewbanks
he
was
astonished
that
holymead
had
taken
up
defence
but
holymead
explanation
was
the
somewhat
extraordinary
one
that
the
man
who
had
killed
the
seducer
of
his
wife
had
done
him
a
service
by
solving
a
problem
that
had
seemed
insoluble
without
a
public
scandal
there
was
no
doubt
that
although
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
in
his
grave
holymead
hatred
of
him
for
his
betrayal
of
his
wife
burned
as
strongly
as
when
he
had
made
the
discovery
that
wrecked
his
home
life
neither
death
nor
time
could
dim
the
impression
nor
lessen
his
hatred
for
the
dead
man
who
had
once
been
his
closest
friend
lethbridge
feeling
that
it
was
his
duty
as
counsel
for
the
prisoner
to
try
every
avenue
which
might
help
to
an
acquittal
asked
tomlinson
the
solicitor
who
was
instructing
him
in
the
case
to
find
birchill
and
bring
him
to
his
chambers
birchill
was
found
and
kept
an
appointment
lethbridge
explained
to
him
that
he
had
nothing
further
to
fear
from
the
police
with
regard
to
the
murder
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
having
been
acquitted
on
this
charge
he
could
not
be
tried
on
it
again
no
matter
what
discoveries
were
made
he
could
not
even
be
tried
for
perjury
as
he
had
not
gone
into
the
having
allowed
these
facts
to
sink
home
he
delicately
suggested
to
birchill
that
he
ought
to
come
forward
as
a
witness
for
the
defence
of
holymead
he
ought
to
do
his
best
to
try
and
save
the
life
of
the
man
who
had
saved
his
life
what
do
you
want
me
to
swear
asked
birchill
in
a
tone
which
indicated
that
although
he
did
not
object
to
committing
perjury
he
wanted
to
know
how
far
he
was
to
go
well
that
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
alive
when
you
went
to
riversbrook
suggested
lethbridge
but
i
tell
you
he
was
dead
protested
birchill
he
seemed
to
think
that
reviving
a
dead
man
was
beyond
even
the
power
of
perjury
that
was
your
original
story
i
know
agreed
lethbridge
suavely
but
as
you
were
not
put
into
the
to
swear
it
you
can
alter
it
without
fear
of
any
consequences
you
want
me
to
swear
that
he
was
alive
said
birchill
meditatively
if
you
can
conscientiously
do
so
replied
lethbridge
that
he
was
alive
when
i
left
riversbrook
asked
birchill
well
not
necessarily
that
said
lethbridge
birchill
sprang
up
in
alarm
good
god
do
you
want
me
to
swear
that
i
killed
him
he
demanded
lethbridge
endeavoured
to
explain
that
he
would
have
nothing
to
fear
from
such
a
confession
in
the
but
birchill
would
listen
to
no
further
explanations
he
felt
that
he
was
in
dangerous
company
and
that
his
safety
depended
on
getting
out
of
the
room
you
made
a
mistake
he
said
as
he
reached
the
door
if
you
want
a
witness
of
that
kind
you
ought
to
look
for
him
in

hatch
chapter
xxx
the
impending
trial
of
holymead
produced
almost
as
much
excitement
in
staid
legal
circles
as
it
did
among
the
general
public
it
was
rumoured
that
there
was
a
difficulty
in
obtaining
a
judge
to
preside
at
the
trial
as
they
all
objected
to
being
placed
in
the
position
of
trying
a
man
who
was
to
them
and
with
whom
most
of
them
had
been
on
friendly
terms
there
was
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
for
the
prisoner
among
the
judges
of
course
they
could
not
admit
that
any
man
had
the
right
to
take
the
law
into
his
own
hands
but
they
realised
that
if
any
wrong
done
to
an
individual
could
justify
this
course
it
was
the
wrong
sir
horace
fewbanks
had
done
to
an
old
friend
when
it
became
known
that
justice
hodson
was
to
preside
at
the
old
bailey
during
the
trial
of
holymead
legal
rumour
concerned
itself
with
statements
to
the
effect
that
there
was
now
a
difficulty
in
obtaining
a
to
undertake
the
prosecution
when
it
was
discovered
that
walters
was
to
conduct
the
prosecution
it
was
whispered
that
he
had
asked
to
be
relieved
of
the
work
and
had
even
waited
on
the
in
the
matter
but
that
the
latter
had
told
him
that
he
must
put
his
personal
feelings
aside
and
act
in
accordance
with
that
high
sense
of
duty
he
had
always
shown
in
his
professional
career
in
newgate
street
a
long
queue
of
people
waited
for
admission
to
old
bailey
on
the
day
the
trial
was
to
begin
they
were
inspected
by
two
fat
policemen
to
decide
whether
they
appeared
respectable
enough
to
be
entitled
to
a
free
seat
at
the
entertainment
in
number
one
court
when
the
doors
opened
at
the
first
batch
of
them
were
admitted
but
on
reaching
the
top
of
the
stairs
where
they
were
inspected
by
a
sergeant
they
were
informed
that
all
the
seats
in
the
gallery
of
number
one
court
had
been
filled
but
that
he
would
graciously
permit
them
to
go
to
numbers
two
three
four
or
five
courts
those
who
were
not
satisfied
with
this
generosity
could
get
out
the
way
they
had
come
in
and
be
quick
about
it
what
the
sergeant
did
not
explain
was
that
so
many
people
with
social
influence
had
applied
to
the
presiding
judge
for
permission
to
be
present
at
the
trial
that
it
had
been
found
necessary
to
reserve
the
gallery
for
them
as
well
as
most
of
the
seats
in
the
body
of
the
court
ladies
and
men
drove
up
to
the
main
entrance
of
the
old
bailey
in
motors
and
the
scene
was
as
busy
as
the
scene
outside
a
west
end
theatre
on
a
first
night
the
services
of
several
policemen
were
necessary
to
regulate
the
arrival
and
departure
of
and
and
to
keep
back
the
staring
mob
of
disappointed
people
who
had
been
refused
admission
to
the
court
by
the
fat
sergeant
but
were
determined
to
see
as
much
as
they
could
before
they
went
away
elderly
ladies
and
young
ladies
were
assisted
from
smart
by
their
escorts
and
greeted
their
friends
with
feminine
fervour
some
of
the
younger
ones
exchanged
whispered
regrets
as
they
swept
into
the
court
that
such
a
man
as
holymead
should
have
got
himself
into
such
a
terrible
predicament
the
legal
profession
was
numerously
represented
among
the
spectators
in
the
body
of
the
court
so
many
distinguished
members
of
the
profession
had
applied
for
tickets
of
admission
that
there
was
little
room
for
members
of
the
junior
bar
it
was
many
years
since
a
trial
had
created
so
much
interest
in
legal
circles
when
justice
hodson
entered
the
court
followed
by
no
fewer
than
eight
of
the
sheriffs
of
london
those
present
in
the
court
rose
the
members
of
the
profession
bowed
slowly
in
the
direction
of
his
honour
the
prisoner
was
brought
into
the
dock
from
below
and
took
the
seat
that
was
given
to
him
beside
one
of
the
two
warders
who
remained
in
the
dock
with
him
he
looked
a
little
careworn
as
though
with
sleepless
nights
but
his
strong
face
was
as
resolute
as
ever
and
betrayed
nothing
of
the
mental
agony
which
he
endured
his
keen
dark
eyes
glanced
quietly
through
the
court
and
though
many
members
of
the
bar
smiled
at
him
when
they
thought
they
had
caught
his
eye
he
gave
no
smile
in
return
as
he
looked
at
justice
hodson
the
distinguished
judge
inclined
his
head
to
what
was
almost
a
nod
of
recognition
but
the
prisoner
looked
calmly
at
the
judge
as
though
he
had
never
seen
him
before
and
had
never
been
inside
a
court
in
his
life
till
then
among
those
persons
standing
in
the
body
of
the
court
were
crewe
and
inspector
chippenfield
and
detective
rolfe
inspector
chippenfield
displayed
so
much
friendliness
to
crewe
as
he
drew
his
attention
to
the
number
of
celebrities
in
court
that
it
was
evident
he
had
buried
for
the
time
being
his
professional
enmity
this
was
because
crewe
had
allowed
him
to
appropriate
some
of
the
credit
of
unravelling
connection
with
the
crime
as
the
jury
were
being
sworn
in
crewe
and
chippenfield
made
their
way
out
of
court
into
the
corridor
as
they
were
to
be
called
as
witnesses
they
would
not
be
allowed
in
court
until
after
they
had
given
their
evidence
walters
in
his
opening
address
paid
tribute
to
the
exceptional
circumstances
of
the
case
by
some
slight
show
of
nervousness
several
times
he
insisted
that
the
case
was
what
he
termed
unique
the
prisoner
in
the
dock
was
a
man
who
by
his
distinguished
abilities
had
won
for
himself
a
leading
position
at
the
bar
and
had
been
honoured
and
respected
by
all
who
knew
him
it
was
not
the
first
occasion
that
a
member
of
the
legal
profession
had
been
placed
on
trial
on
a
capital
charge
though
he
was
glad
to
say
for
the
honour
of
the
profession
that
cases
of
the
kind
were
extremely
rare
but
what
made
the
case
unique
was
that
it
was
not
the
first
trial
in
connection
with
the
murder
of
sir
horace
fewbanks
and
that
at
the
first
trial
when
a
man
named
frederick
birchill
had
been
placed
in
the
dock
the
prisoner
now
before
the
court
had
appeared
as
defending
counsel
and
by
his
brilliant
conduct
of
the
defence
had
materially
contributed
to
the
verdict
of
acquittal
which
had
been
brought
in
by
the
jury
some
evidence
would
be
placed
before
the
jury
about
the
first
trial
and
the
conduct
of
the
defence
he
ventured
to
assert
that
the
jury
would
find
in
this
evidence
some
damaging
facts
against
the
prisoner
that
they
would
find
a
clear
indication
that
the
prisoner
had
defended
birchill
because
he
knew
himself
to
be
guilty
of
this
murder
and
felt
an
obligation
on
him
to
place
his
legal
knowledge
and
forensic
powers
at
the
disposal
of
a
man
whom
he
knew
to
be
innocent
at
the
former
trial
the
prisoner
as
counsel
for
the
defence
had
attempted
to
throw
suspicion
on
a
man
named
hill
who
had
been
butler
to
the
late
sir
horace
fewbanks
but
evidence
would
be
placed
before
the
jury
to
show
that
in
doing
so
the
prisoner
had
been
smitten
by
some
pangs
of
conscience
at
casting
suspicion
on
a
man
who
he
knew
was
not
guilty
it
was
not
incumbent
on
the
prosecution
to
prove
a
motive
for
the
murder
continued
walters
though
where
the
motive
was
plainly
proved
the
case
against
the
prisoner
was
naturally
strengthened
in
this
case
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
motive
but
the
extent
of
the
evidence
to
be
placed
before
the
jury
under
that
head
would
depend
upon
the
defence
the
prosecution
would
submit
some
evidence
on
the
point
but
the
full
story
could
only
be
told
if
the
defence
placed
the
wife
of
the
prisoner
in
the
it
was
impossible
for
the
prosecution
to
call
her
as
a
witness
as
english
law
prevented
a
wife
giving
evidence
against
her
husband
she
could
however
give
evidence
in
favour
of
her
husband
and
doubtless
the
defence
would
take
full
advantage
of
the
privilege
of
calling
her
the
evidence
which
he
intended
to
call
would
show
that
for
years
past
very
friendly
relations
had
existed
between
the
prisoner
and
the
murdered
man
they
had
been
at
cambridge
together
and
had
studied
law
together
in
chambers
their
friendship
continued
after
their
marriages
the
prisoner
had
married
a
second
time
and
at
that
time
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
a
widower
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
what
was
known
as
a
ladies
man
and
at
the
previous
trial
prisoner
as
defending
counsel
had
tried
to
bring
out
that
sir
horace
was
a
man
of
immoral
reputation
among
women
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
prisoner
during
sir
horace
absence
in
scotland
became
convinced
that
sir
horace
had
been
paying
attention
to
his
wife
there
was
no
doubt
that
being
a
man
of
a
jealous
disposition
his
suspicions
went
beyond
that
at
any
rate
he
wrote
a
letter
to
sir
horace
at
craigleith
hall
where
the
latter
was
shooting
asking
him
to
come
to
london
at
once
in
order
to
induce
sir
horace
to
return
and
in
order
not
to
arouse
suspicion
as
to
his
real
object
he
concocted
a
story
about
a
vacancy
in
the
court
of
appeal
bench
to
which
it
appeared
sir
horace
fewbanks
desired
to
be
appointed
in
this
letter
which
would
be
produced
in
evidence
the
prisoner
pretended
to
be
working
in
sir
interests
and
offered
to
meet
him
on
the
night
of
his
return
at
riversbrook
and
let
him
know
fully
how
matters
stood
sir
horace
apparently
wrote
to
the
prisoner
making
an
appointment
with
him
for
the
night
of
the
of
august
the
prisoner
kept
that
appointment
charged
sir
horace
with
carrying
on
an
intrigue
with
his
wife
and
then
shot
him
that
is
the
case
for
the
prosecution
which
i
will
endeavour
to
establish
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury
said
walters
in
concluding
his
speech
of
course
it
is
impossible
to
produce
direct
evidence
of
the
actual
shooting
but
i
will
produce
a
silent
but
indisputable
witness
in
the
form
of
a
glove
which
belonged
to
the
prisoner
that
he
was
present
in
the
room
in
which
the
murder
took
place
i
will
produce
evidence
to
show
that
the
prisoner
left
his
stick
behind
in
the
in
the
hall
on
the
night
of
the
murder
these
things
prove
conclusively
that
he
left
riversbrook
in
a
state
of
considerable
excitement
the
fact
that
after
the
murder
was
discovered
he
kept
hidden
in
his
own
breast
the
knowledge
that
he
had
been
there
on
that
night
instead
of
going
to
the
police
and
in
the
endeavour
to
assist
them
to
detect
the
murderer
of
his
lifelong
friend
informing
them
that
he
had
called
on
sir
horace
shows
conclusively
that
he
went
there
on
a
mission
on
which
he
dared
not
throw
the
light
of
day
those
witnesses
who
had
given
evidence
at
the
police
court
were
called
and
repeated
their
statements
inspector
seldon
was
closely
by
lethbridge
as
to
the
way
in
which
the
dead
body
was
dressed
when
he
discovered
it
he
declared
that
sir
horace
had
been
wearing
a
light
lounge
suit
of
grey
colour
a
silk
shirt
wing
collar
and
black
bow
tie
slingsby
was
directed
to
ascertaining
as
near
as
possible
the
time
when
the
murder
was
committed
but
this
was
a
point
on
which
the
witness
allowed
himself
to
be
irritatingly
indefinite
the
murder
might
have
taken
place
three
or
four
hours
before
midnight
on
the
of
august
and
on
the
other
hand
it
might
have
taken
place
any
time
up
to
three
or
four
hours
after
midnight
hill
who
had
not
been
available
as
a
witness
at
the
police
court
being
then
on
the
way
back
from
america
in
response
to
a
cablegram
from
crewe
reappeared
as
a
witness
he
looked
much
more
at
ease
in
the
than
on
the
occasion
when
he
gave
evidence
against
birchill
he
had
fully
recovered
from
his
terror
of
being
arrested
for
the
murder
and
obviously
had
much
satisfaction
in
giving
evidence
against
the
man
who
according
to
his
impression
had
tried
to
bring
the
crime
home
to
him
he
gave
evidence
as
to
the
unexpected
return
of
his
master
from
scotland
on
the
of
august
and
also
in
regard
to
the
relations
between
his
master
and
holymead
on
several
occasions
he
had
seen
his
master
kiss
holymead
and
once
he
had
heard
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
they
were
together
being
locked
two
new
witnesses
were
called
to
testify
to
the
suggestion
of
the
prosecution
that
illicit
relations
had
existed
between
sir
horace
fewbanks
and
holymead
these
were
philip
williams
who
had
been
the
dead
man
chauffeur
and
dorothy
mason
who
had
been
housemaid
at
riversbrook
the
chauffeur
gave
evidence
as
to
meeting
car
at
various
places
in
the
country
he
formed
the
opinion
from
the
first
that
these
meetings
between
sir
horace
and
the
lady
were
not
accidental
the
last
of
the
prosecution
witnesses
was
the
legal
shorthand
writer
who
had
taken
the
official
report
of
the
trial
of
birchill
in
response
to
the
request
of
walters
he
read
from
his
notebook
the
final
passage
in
the
opening
address
delivered
by
the
prisoner
at
that
trial
as
defending
counsel
is
my
duty
to
convince
you
that
my
client
is
not
guilty
or
in
other
words
to
convince
you
that
the
murder
was
committed
before
he
reached
the
house
it
is
only
with
the
greatest
reluctance
that
i
take
upon
myself
the
responsibility
of
pointing
an
accusing
finger
at
another
man
in
crimes
of
this
kind
you
can
not
expect
to
get
anything
but
circumstantial
evidence
but
there
are
degrees
of
circumstantial
evidence
and
my
duty
to
my
client
lays
upon
me
the
obligation
of
pointing
out
to
you
that
there
is
one
person
against
whom
the
existing
circumstantial
evidence
is
stronger
than
it
is
against
my
client
lethbridge
was
unexpectedly
brief
in
his
opening
address
he
ridiculed
the
idea
that
a
man
like
the
prisoner
trained
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
law
would
take
the
law
into
his
own
hands
in
seeking
revenge
for
a
wrong
that
had
been
done
to
him
according
to
the
prosecution
the
prisoner
had
calmly
and
deliberately
carried
out
this
murder
he
had
sent
a
letter
to
sir
horace
fewbanks
with
the
object
of
inducing
him
to
return
to
london
and
had
subsequently
gone
to
riversbrook
and
shot
the
man
who
had
been
his
lifelong
friend
could
anything
be
more
improbable
than
to
suppose
that
a
man
of
the
training
intellect
and
force
of
character
would
be
swayed
by
a
gust
of
passion
into
committing
such
a
dreadful
crime
like
an
immature
ignorant
youth
of
unbalanced
temperament
the
discovery
that
his
wife
and
his
friend
were
carrying
on
an
intrigue
would
be
more
likely
to
fill
him
with
disgust
than
inspire
him
with
murderous
rage
he
would
not
deny
that
accused
had
gone
up
to
riversbrook
a
few
hours
after
sir
horace
fewbanks
returned
from
scotland
he
would
admit
that
when
the
accused
sought
this
interview
he
knew
that
his
quondam
friend
had
done
him
the
greatest
wrong
one
man
could
do
another
but
he
emphatically
denied
that
the
prisoner
killed
sir
horace
fewbanks
or
threatened
to
take
his
life
his
learned
friend
had
asked
why
had
not
the
prisoner
gone
to
the
police
after
the
murder
was
discovered
and
told
them
that
he
had
seen
sir
horace
at
riversbrook
that
night
the
answer
to
that
was
clear
and
emphatic
he
did
not
want
to
take
the
police
into
his
confidence
with
regard
to
the
relations
that
had
existed
between
his
wife
and
the
dead
man
he
wanted
to
save
his
wife
name
from
scandal
was
not
that
a
natural
impulse
for
a
man
the
prisoner
had
believed
that
in
due
course
the
police
would
discover
the
actual
murderer
and
that
in
the
meantime
the
scandal
which
threatened
his
wife
name
would
be
buried
with
the
man
who
had
wronged
her
if
the
prisoner
could
have
prevented
it
his
wife
name
would
not
have
been
dragged
into
this
case
even
for
the
purpose
of
saving
himself
from
injustice
but
the
prosecution
in
order
to
establish
a
motive
for
the
crime
had
dragged
this
scandal
into
light
he
did
not
blame
the
prosecution
in
the
least
for
that
in
fact
he
was
grateful
to
his
learned
friend
for
doing
so
for
it
had
released
him
from
a
promise
extracted
from
him
by
the
prisoner
not
to
make
any
use
of
the
matter
in
his
conduct
of
the
case
the
defence
was
that
although
the
accused
man
had
gone
to
riversbrook
on
the
night
of
the
of
august
to
accuse
sir
horace
fewbanks
of
base
treachery
he
went
there
unarmed
and
with
no
intention
of
committing
violence
no
threats
were
used
and
no
shot
was
fired
during
the
interview
and
in
proof
of
the
latter
contention
he
intended
to
call
witnesses
to
prove
that
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
alive
after
the
prisoner
had
left
the
house
the
name
of
daniel
kemp
was
loudly
called
by
the
ushers
and
when
kemp
crossed
the
court
on
the
way
to
the
chippenfield
and
crewe
who
had
returned
to
the
court
after
giving
their
evidence
looked
at
one
another
he
a
dead
man
whispered
chippenfield
nodding
his
head
towards
the
prisoner
if
this
is
a
sample
of
their
witnesses
kemp
had
brushed
himself
up
for
his
appearance
in
the
he
wore
a
new
tweed
suit
his
thick
neck
was
encased
in
a
white
linen
collar
which
he
kept
fingering
with
one
hand
as
though
trying
to
loosen
it
for
his
greater
comfort
and
his
hair
had
been
plastered
flat
on
his
head
with
plenty
of
cold
water
his
red
and
scratched
chin
further
indicated
that
he
had
taken
considerable
pains
with
a
razor
to
improve
his
personal
appearance
in
keeping
with
his
unwonted
part
of
a
respectable
witness
in
a
place
which
knew
a
more
sinister
side
of
him
as
he
stood
in
the
awkwardly
avoiding
the
significant
glances
that
the
scotland
yard
men
and
the
police
cast
at
him
he
appeared
to
be
more
nervous
and
anxious
than
he
usually
was
when
in
the
dock
but
crewe
who
was
watching
him
closely
was
struck
by
the
look
of
devotion
he
hurriedly
cast
at
the
weary
face
of
the
man
in
the
dock
before
he
commenced
to
give
his
evidence
he
told
the
court
a
remarkable
story
he
declared
that
birchill
had
told
him
on
the
of
august
that
he
had
a
job
on
at
riversbrook
and
had
asked
him
to
join
him
in
it
when
birchill
explained
the
details
witness
declined
to
have
a
hand
in
it
he
did
not
like
these
jobs
lethbridge
interposed
to
explain
to
any
particularly
unsophisticated
jurymen
that
a
job
meant
a
burglary
that
had
been
arranged
with
the
connivance
of
a
servant
in
the
house
to
be
broken
into
kemp
declared
that
the
reason
he
had
declined
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
project
to
burgle
riversbrook
was
that
he
felt
sure
hill
would
squeak
if
the
police
threatened
him
when
they
came
to
investigate
the
burglary
he
happened
to
be
at
hampstead
on
the
evening
of
the
of
august
and
he
took
a
walk
along
tanton
gardens
to
have
another
look
at
the
place
which
birchill
was
to
break
into
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
things
might
not
be
square
and
that
hill
might
have
laid
a
trap
for
birchill
that
was
about
he
was
just
able
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
house
through
the
plantation
in
front
of
it
the
mansion
appeared
all
in
darkness
but
while
he
looked
he
was
surprised
to
see
a
light
appear
in
the
upper
portion
of
the
house
which
was
visible
from
the
road
he
went
through
the
carriage
gates
with
the
intention
of
getting
a
closer
view
of
the
house
as
he
walked
along
he
heard
a
quick
footstep
on
the
gravel
walk
behind
him
and
he
slipped
into
the
plantation
looking
out
from
behind
a
tree
he
could
discern
the
figure
of
a
man
walking
quickly
towards
the
house
as
he
drew
near
him
the
man
paused
struck
a
match
and
looked
at
his
watch
and
he
saw
that
it
was
holymead
suspicions
in
regard
to
a
trap
having
been
laid
for
birchill
were
strengthened
and
he
decided
to
ascertain
what
was
in
the
wind
he
crept
through
the
plantation
to
the
edge
of
the
garden
in
front
of
the
house
from
there
he
could
hear
voices
in
a
room
upstairs
he
tried
to
make
out
what
was
being
said
but
he
was
too
far
away
for
that
in
about
half
an
hour
the
voices
stopped
and
a
minute
later
a
man
came
out
of
the
house
and
walked
down
the
path
through
the
garden
and
entered
the
carriage
drive
close
to
where
witness
was
concealed
in
the
plantation
as
he
passed
him
witness
saw
that
it
was
holymead
about
five
minutes
afterwards
the
window
upstairs
in
the
room
where
the
voices
had
come
from
was
opened
and
sir
horace
fewbanks
leaned
out
and
looked
at
the
sky
as
if
to
ascertain
what
sort
of
a
night
it
was
he
was
quite
certain
that
it
was
sir
horace
fewbanks
he
was
well
acquainted
with
that
gentleman
features
having
been
sentenced
by
him
three
years
ago
sir
horace
seemed
quite
calm
and
collected
witness
was
so
surprised
to
see
him
after
having
been
told
by
birchill
that
he
was
in
scotland
that
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
him
during
the
two
or
three
minutes
that
he
remained
at
the
window
breathing
the
night
air
sir
horace
was
fully
dressed
he
had
on
a
light
tweed
suit
and
he
was
wearing
a
soft
shirt
of
a
light
colour
with
a
stiff
collar
and
a
small
black
bow
tie
when
sir
horace
closed
the
window
witness
jumped
over
the
fence
back
into
the
wood
and
made
his
way
to
the
hampstead
tube
station
with
the
intention
of
warning
birchill
that
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
at
home
he
waited
at
the
station
over
an
hour
and
as
he
did
not
see
birchill
he
then
made
his
way
home
during
the
time
he
was
in
the
garden
at
riversbrook
listening
to
the
voices
he
heard
no
sound
of
a
shot
he
was
certain
that
no
shot
had
been
fired
inside
the
house
from
the
time
the
prisoner
entered
the
house
until
he
left
had
a
shot
been
fired
witness
could
not
have
failed
to
hear
it
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
effect
produced
in
court
by
the
evidence
of
the
witness
was
extremely
favourable
to
the
prisoner
kemp
had
told
a
plain
straightforward
story
the
fact
that
he
had
shown
no
reluctance
in
disclosing
in
his
evidence
that
he
was
a
criminal
and
the
associate
of
criminals
seemed
to
add
to
the
credibility
of
his
evidence
it
was
felt
that
he
would
not
have
come
to
court
to
swear
falsely
on
behalf
of
a
man
who
was
so
far
removed
from
the
class
to
which
he
belonged
while
kemp
was
giving
his
evidence
crewe
had
despatched
a
messenger
to
his
chambers
in
holborn
for
joe
when
the
boy
returned
with
the
messenger
kemp
was
still
in
the
undergoing
an
examination
at
the
hands
of
the
judge
sir
henry
hodson
seemed
to
have
been
impressed
by
the
witness
story
for
he
asked
kemp
a
number
of
questions
and
entered
his
answers
in
his
notebook
joe
whispered
crewe
as
the
boy
stole
noiselessly
behind
him
look
at
that
man
in
the
have
you
ever
seen
him
before
rayther
whispered
the
boy
in
reply
why
it
who
tried
to
frighten
me
in
the
loft
if
i
did
promise
to
give
up
watching
mr
holymead
you
are
quite
certain
joe
certain
sure
there
ai
no
charnst
of
me
mistaking
a
man
like
that
crewe
listened
intently
to
kemp
evidence
and
he
watched
the
man
face
as
he
swore
that
he
had
seen
sir
horace
fewbanks
leaning
out
of
the
window
after
holymead
had
left
the
house
he
hastily
took
out
a
notebook
scribbled
a
few
lines
on
one
of
the
leaves
tore
it
out
and
beckoned
to
a
court
usher
take
that
to
walters
he
whispered
the
man
did
so
walters
opened
the
note
adjusted
his
glasses
and
read
it
he
started
with
surprise
read
the
note
through
again
then
turned
round
as
though
in
search
of
the
writer
when
he
saw
crewe
he
raised
his
eyebrows
interrogatively
and
the
detective
nodded
emphatically
lethbridge
sat
down
having
finished
his
examination
of
kemp
walters
with
another
glance
at
crewe

rose
slowly
in
his
place
i
ask
your

that
i
may
be
allowed

defer
until
the
morning
my
of
this
witness
he
said
i

of
course

in
this
matter
but
i
can
assure

desirable
in
the
interests
of

should
be
postponed
i
protest
your
honour
against
the
of
the
witness
being
deferred
said
lethbridge
there
is
no
justification
of
it
i
would
urge
your
honour
to
accede
to
my
request
said
walters
it
is
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
is
your
next
witness
available
mr
lethbridge
asked
the
judge
surely
your
honour
you
not
going
to
allow
the
of
this
witness
to
be
postponed
protested
lethbridge
my
learned
friend
has
given
no
reason
for
such
a
course
sir
henry
hodson
looked
at
the
court
clock
it
is
now
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
the
ordinary
time
for
adjournment
he
began
i
think
the
fairest
way
out
of
the
difficulty
will
be
to
adjourn
the
court
now
until
morning
there
was
a
loud
buzz
of
conversation
when
the
court
adjourned
after
asking
chippenfield
and
rolfe
to
wait
for
him
crewe
made
his
way
to
walters
and
after
a
few
whispered
words
with
that
gentleman
mathers
his
junior
and
salter
the
instructing
solicitor
he
returned
to
chippenfield
and
rolfe
and
asked
them
to
accompany
him
in
a
to
riversbrook
what
do
you
want
to
go
out
there
for
asked
inspector
chippenfield
you
do
expect
to
discover
anything
there
this
late
in
the
day
do
you
i
want
to
find
out
whether
this
man
kemp
is
lying
or
telling
the
truth
of
course
he
is
lying
replied
the
positive
police
official
when
you
had
as
much
experience
with
criminals
as
i
have
had
crewe
you
wo
expect
a
word
of
truth
from
any
of
them
well
let
us
go
to
riversbrook
and
prove
that
he
is
lying
said
crewe
we
go
with
you
said
inspector
chippenfield
speaking
for
rolfe
and
himself
he
did
not
understand
how
crewe
expected
to
obtain
any
evidence
at
riversbrook
about
the
truth
or
falsity
of
kemp
story
but
he
did
not
intend
to
admit
that
but
you
can
set
your
mind
at
rest
no
jury
will
believe
kemp
after
we
given
them
his
record
in
rolfe
whose
association
with
crewe
in
the
case
had
awakened
in
him
a
keen
admiration
for
the
private
detective
methods
and
abilities
permitted
himself
to
defy
his
superior
officer
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
the
best
way
to
prove
kemp
a
liar
is
to
prove
that
his
story
is
false
during
the
drive
to
hampstead
from
the
old
bailey
the
three
men
discussed
kemp
and
his
past
record
it
was
recalled
that
less
than
twelve
months
ago
while
he
was
serving
three
years
for
burglary
his
daughter
had
provided
the
newspapers
with
a
sensation
by
dying
in
the
dock
while
sentence
was
being
passed
on
her
according
to
inspector
chippenfield
who
had
been
in
charge
of
the
case
against
her
she
was
a
stylish
girl
and
when
dressed
up
might
easily
have
been
mistaken
for
a
lady
she
got
in
touch
with
a
flash
gang
of
railway
thieves
from
america
said
inspector
chippenfield
helping
himself
to
a
cigar
from
proffered
case
they
used
to
work
the
express
trains
robbing
the
passengers
in
the
sleeping
berths
she
was
neatly
caught
at
victoria
station
in
calling
for
a
that
had
been
left
at
the
cloak
room
by
one
of
the
gang
inside
the
was
lady
jewel
case
which
had
been
stolen
on
the
journey
up
from
brighton
the
thief
being
afraid
that
he
might
be
stopped
at
victoria
station
when
the
loss
of
the
jewel
case
was
discovered
had
placed
it
inside
his
and
had
left
the
at
the
cloak
room
he
sent
dora
kemp
for
it
a
few
days
later
as
he
believed
he
had
outwitted
the
police
but
i
got
on
to
the
track
of
the
jewels
and
after
removing
them
from
the
in
the
cloak
room
i
had
the
cloak
room
watched
when
dora
kemp
called
for
the
and
handed
in
the
cloakroom
ticket
the
attendant
gave
my
men
the
signal
and
she
was
arrested
she
died
of
heart
disease
while
on
trial
did
she
asked
crewe
yes
replied
inspector
chippenfield
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
the
judge
he
gave
her
five
years
and
no
sooner
were
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
than
she
threw
up
her
hands
and
fell
forward
in
the
dock
she
was
dead
when
they
picked
her
up
she
was
as
game
as
they
make
them
put
in
rolfe
we
tried
to
get
her
to
give
the
others
away
but
she
would
though
she
would
have
got
off
with
a
few
months
if
she
had
the
gang
got
frightened
and
cleared
out
they
left
her
in
the
lurch
but
she
would
give
one
of
them
away
it
was
holymead
who
defended
her
said
chippenfield
it
was
a
strange
thing
for
him
to
do
leading
barristers
do
like
touching
criminal
cases
because
as
a
rule
there
is
little
money
and
less
credit
to
be
got
out
of
them
but
holymead
did
some
queer
things
at
times
as
you
know
he
must
have
taken
up
the
case
out
of
interest
in
the
girl
herself
for
i
certain
she
had
the
money
to
brief
him
and
i
did
hear
afterwards
that
holymead
undertook
to
see
that
she
was
decently
buried
why
that
explains
it
exclaims
crewe
in
the
voice
of
a
man
who
had
solved
a
difficulty
explains
what
asked
inspector
chippenfield
explains
why
her
father
has
taken
the
risk
of
coming
forward
in
this
case
to
give
evidence
for
holymead
gratitude
for
what
holymead
had
done
for
his
girl
while
he
was
in
prison
my
experience
of
criminals
is
that
they
frequently
show
more
real
gratitude
to
those
who
do
them
a
good
turn
than
people
in
a
respectable
walk
of
life
besides
you
know
what
a
sentimental
value
people
of
his
class
attach
to
seeing
their
kin
buried
decently
if
holymead
had
come
forward
the
girl
would
have
been
buried
as
a
pauper
in
all
probability
but
i
do
see
that
old
kemp
is
taking
much
risk
said
inspector
chippenfield
he
is
only
perjuring
himself
and
he
is
too
used
to
that
to
regard
it
as
a
risk
do
you
think
he
will
be
in
an
awkward
position
if
the
jury
were
to
acquit
holymead
asked
crewe
one
jury
has
already
said
that
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
dead
when
birchill
broke
into
the
house
and
if
this
jury
believes
kemp
story
and
says
sir
horace
was
alive
when
holymead
left
it
do
you
think
kemp
will
conclude
that
it
will
be
best
for
him
to
disappear
some
one
must
have
killed
sir
horace
after
holymead
left
and
before
birchill
arrived
whew
i
never
thought
of
that
said
rolfe
candidly
kemp
is
a
liar
from
first
to
last
said
inspector
chippenfield
decisively
chapter
xxxi
when
they
reached
riversbrook
they
entered
the
carriage
drive
and
traversed
the
plantation
until
they
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
italian
garden
facing
the
house
the
gaunt
irregular
mansion
stood
empty
and
deserted
for
miss
fewbanks
had
left
the
place
after
her
funeral
with
the
determination
not
to
return
to
it
the
wind
whistled
drearily
through
the
nooks
and
crannies
of
the
unfinished
brickwork
of
the
upper
story
and
a
faint
evening
mist
rose
from
the
soddened
garden
and
floated
in
a
thin
cloud
past
the
library
window
as
though
the
ghost
of
the
dead
judge
were
revisiting
the
house
in
search
of
his
murderer
the
garden
had
lost
its
summer
beauty
and
was
littered
with
dead
leaves
from
the
trees
the
gathering
greyness
of
an
autumn
twilight
added
to
the
dreariness
of
the
scene
kemp
did
say
how
far
he
stood
from
the
house
said
crewe
but
assume
he
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
plantation
about
where
we
are
standing
now
to
begin
with
how
far
are
we
from
that
library
window
chippenfield
about
fifty
yards
i
should
say
said
the
inspector
measuring
it
with
his
eye
i
should
say
seventy
said
rolfe
and
i
say
somewhere
midway
between
the
two
said
crewe
with
a
smile
but
we
will
soon
see
just
hold
down
the
end
of
this
measuring
tape
one
of
you
he
produced
a
measuring
tape
as
he
spoke
and
started
to
unwind
it
walking
rapidly
towards
the
house
as
he
did
so
yards
he
said
as
he
returned
he
made
a
note
of
the
distance
in
his
so
much
for
that
he
said
but
that
not
enough
i
want
you
to
stand
under
the
library
window
rolfe
by
that
in
front
of
it
and
act
as
pivot
for
the
measuring
tape
while
i
look
at
that
window
from
various
angles
my
idea
is
to
go
in
a
semicircle
right
round
the
garden
starting
at
the
garage
by
the
edge
of
the
wood
so
as
to
see
the
library
window
and
measure
the
distance
at
every
possible
point
at
which
kemp
could
have
stood
you
going
to
a
lot
of
trouble
for
nothing
if
your
object
is
to
try
and
prove
that
he
could
have
seen
into
the
window
grunted
inspector
chippenfield
in
a
mystified
voice
why
i
can
see
plainly
into
the
window
from
here
crewe
smiled
but
did
not
reply
followed
by
rolfe
he
went
back
to
the
tree
by
the
library
window
where
he
posted
rolfe
with
the
end
of
the
tape
in
his
hand
then
he
walked
slowly
back
across
the
garden
in
the
direction
of
the
garage
keeping
his
eye
on
the
library
window
on
the
first
floor
from
which
kemp
according
to
his
evidence
had
seen
sir
horace
leaning
out
after
holymead
had
left
the
house
he
returned
to
the
tree
noting
the
measurement
in
his
book
as
he
did
so
and
then
repeated
the
process
walking
backwards
with
his
eye
fixed
on
the
window
but
this
time
taking
a
line
more
to
the
left
again
and
again
he
repeated
the
process
until
finally
he
had
walked
backwards
from
the
tree
in
narrow
segments
of
a
big
semicircle
finishing
up
on
the
boundary
of
the
italian
garden
on
the
other
side
of
the
grounds
and
almost
directly
opposite
to
the
garage
from
which
he
had
started
there
no
use
going
further
back
than
that
he
said
turning
to
inspector
chippenfield
who
had
followed
him
round
smoking
one
of
crewe
cigars
and
very
much
mystified
by
the
whole
proceedings
though
he
would
not
have
admitted
it
on
any
account
at
this
point
we
practically
lose
sight
of
the
window
altogether
except
for
an
oblique
glimpse
certainly
kemp
would
not
come
as
far
back
as
this
he
would
have
no
object
in
doing
so
i
quite
agree
with
you
said
inspector
chippenfield
he
would
stand
more
in
the
front
of
the
house
the
tree
in
front
of
the
house
obstruct
the
view
of
the
window
to
any
extent
the
tree
to
which
inspector
chippenfield
referred
was
a
solitary
which
grew
close
to
the
house
a
little
distance
from
the
main
entrance
and
reached
to
a
height
of
about
forty
feet
its
branches
were
entirely
bare
of
leaves
for
the
autumn
frosts
and
winds
had
swept
the
foliage
away
rolfe
who
had
been
watching
crewe
manoeuvres
curiously
walked
up
to
them
with
the
tape
in
his
hand
he
glanced
at
the
library
window
on
the
first
floor
as
he
reached
them
kemp
could
have
seen
the
library
window
if
he
had
stood
here
he
said
i
should
say
that
if
the
blind
were
up
it
would
be
possible
to
see
right
into
the
room
what
do
you
say
chippenfield
asked
crewe
turning
to
that
officer
inspector
chippenfield
had
taken
his
stand
stolidly
on
the
centre
path
of
the
italian
garden
directly
in
front
of
the
window
of
the
library
i
say
kemp
is
a
liar
he
replied
knocking
the
ash
off
his
cigar
a
d
d
liar
he
added
emphatically
i
do
believe
he
was
here
at
all
that
night
but
if
he
was
here
do
you
think
he
saw
sir
horace
leaning
out
of
the
window
i
do
see
what
was
to
prevent
him
was
the
reply
but
my
point
is
that
he
was
a
liar
and
that
he
was
here
at
all
and
you
rolfe
do
you
think
kemp
could
have
seen
sir
horace
leaning
out
of
the
window
if
he
had
been
here
i
should
say
so
remarked
rolfe
in
a
somewhat
puzzled
tone
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
agree
with
either
of
you
said
crewe
i
think
kemp
was
here
but
i
am
sure
he
could
have
seen
sir
horace
from
the
window
kemp
has
been
up
here
during
the
past
few
days
in
order
to
prepare
his
evidence
and
he
been
led
astray
by
a
very
simple
mistake
if
a
man
were
to
lean
outside
the
library
window
now
there
would
not
be
much
difficulty
in
identifying
him
but
when
the
murder
took
place
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
see
him
from
any
part
of
the
garden
or
grounds
why
demanded
inspector
chippenfield
because
it
was
the
middle
of
summer
when
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
murdered
at
that
time
that
would
be
in
full
leaf
and
the
foliage
would
hide
the
window
completely
look
at
the
number
of
branches
the
tree
has
they
stretch
all
over
the
window
and
even
round
the
corners
of
that
unfinished
brickwork
on
the
first
floor
by
the
side
of
the
library
window
a
man
could
no
more
see
through
that
tree
in
summer
time
than
he
could
see
through
a
stone
wall
what
did
i
tell
you
exclaimed
inspector
chippenfield
in
the
voice
of
a
man
whose
case
had
been
fully
proved
did
i
say
kemp
was
a
liar
we
call
evidence
in
rebuttal
to
prove
that
he
is
a
liar
that
he
could
have
seen
the
window
and
after
holymead
is
convicted
i
see
if
i
can
not
get
a
warrant
out
for
kemp
for
perjury
and
yet
kemp
did
see
sir
horace
that
night
said
crewe
quietly
how
do
you
know
what
makes
you
say
that
the
inspector
was
unpleasantly
startled
by
crewe
contention
he
was
able
to
describe
accurately
how
sir
horace
was
dressed
for
one
thing
responded
crewe
he
might
have
got
that
from
seldon
evidence
said
inspector
chippenfield
thoughtfully
he
may
have
had
some
one
in
court
to
tell
him
what
seldon
said
you
do
not
think
lethbridge
would
be
a
party
to
such
tactics
said
crewe
no
no
one
could
tell
from
the
way
he
examined
seldon
and
kemp
on
the
point
that
it
was
in
his
brief
but
the
fact
that
kemp
knew
how
sir
horace
was
dressed
does
prove
that
he
saw
sir
horace
after
holymead
left
the
house
said
rolfe
kemp
may
have
seen
sir
horace
before
holymead
arrived
quite
true
rolfe
said
crewe
i
have
lost
sight
of
that
point
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
there
is
a
bit
of
a
mystery
here
which
wants
clearing
up
they
drove
back
to
town
and
in
accordance
with
the
arrangement
crewe
had
made
with
walters
before
leaving
the
court
they
waited
on
that
gentleman
at
his
chambers
in
lincoln
inn
there
crewe
told
him
of
the
result
of
their
investigations
at
riversbrook
walters
was
professionally
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
destroying
the
evidence
of
kemp
he
was
not
a
man
and
personally
he
would
have
preferred
to
see
holymead
acquitted
if
that
were
possible
but
as
the
prosecuting
counsel
he
felt
a
professional
satisfaction
in
being
placed
in
the
position
to
expose
perjured
evidence
excellent
excellent
he
exclaimed
rubbing
his
hands
with
gratification
as
he
spoke
knowing
what
we
know
now
it
will
be
a
comparatively
easy
task
to
expose
the
witness
kemp
under
and
show
his
evidence
to
be
false
walters
looked
as
though
he
relished
the
prospect
it
was
arranged
that
inspector
chippenfield
should
be
called
to
give
evidence
in
rebuttal
as
to
the
impossibility
of
seeing
the
library
window
through
the
tree
and
that
an
arboriculturist
should
also
be
called
walters
agreed
to
have
the
expert
in
attendance
at
the
court
in
the
morning
but
crewe
had
something
more
on
his
mind
and
he
waited
until
chippenfield
and
rolfe
had
taken
their
departure
in
order
to
put
his
views
before
the
prosecuting
counsel
then
he
pointed
out
to
him
that
to
prove
that
kemp
evidence
was
false
was
merely
to
obtain
a
negative
result
what
he
wanted
was
a
positive
result
in
other
words
he
wanted
kemp
true
story
you
do
not
think
then
that
kemp
is
merely
committing
perjury
in
order
to
get
holymead
off
asked
walters
meditatively
you
think
he
is
hiding
something
crewe
replied
with
his
faint
inscrutable
smile
that
he
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
such
was
the
case
he
thought
kemp
true
story
might
be
obtained
if
walters
directed
his
to
obtaining
the
truth
instead
of
merely
to
exposing
falsehood
it
was
evident
to
him
that
kemp
had
come
forward
in
order
to
save
the
prisoner
how
far
was
he
prepared
to
go
in
carrying
out
that
object
when
he
was
made
to
realise
that
his
perjury
instead
of
helping
holymead
had
helped
to
convince
the
jury
of
the
prisoner
guilt
would
he
tell
the
true
story
of
how
much
he
knew
my
own
opinion
is
that
he
will
continued
crewe
i
studied
his
face
very
closely
while
he
was
in
the
box
and
i
am
convinced
he
would
go
far
even
to
telling
the
truth
in
order
to
save
the
only
man
who
was
ever
kind
to
him
walters
was
slow
in
coming
round
to
crewe
point
of
view
he
had
a
high
opinion
of
crewe
for
in
his
association
with
the
case
he
had
realised
how
skilfully
crewe
had
worked
out
the
solution
of
the
riversbrook
mystery
but
he
took
the
view
that
now
the
case
was
before
the
court
it
was
entirely
a
matter
for
the
legal
profession
to
deal
with
he
pointed
out
to
crewe
the
professional
view
that
his
own
duty
did
not
extend
beyond
the
exposure
of
kemp
perjury
it
was
not
his
duty
to
give
kemp
a
second
chance
an
opportunity
to
qualify
his
evidence
he
believed
the
defence
had
called
kemp
in
the
belief
that
his
evidence
was
true
but
the
defence
must
take
the
consequences
if
they
built
up
their
case
on
perjured
evidence
which
they
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
sift
crewe
entered
into
the
professional
view
sympathetically
but
he
was
not
to
be
turned
from
his
purpose
he
felt
that
too
much
was
at
stake
and
he
lifted
the
discussion
out
of
the
atmosphere
of
professional
procedure
into
that
of
their
common
manhood
walters
i
know
you
are
not
a
vain
man
he
said
earnestly
a
personal
triumph
in
this
case
means
even
less
to
you
than
it
does
to
me
i
have
built
up
what
i
regard
as
an
overwhelming
case
against
holymead
but
it
is
based
on
circumstantial
evidence
and
i
would
willingly
see
the
whole
thing
toppled
over
if
by
that
means
we
could
get
the
final
truth
this
man
kemp
knows
the
truth
and
you
are
in
a
position
in
which
you
can
get
the
truth
from
him
it
may
be
the
last
chance
anyone
will
have
of
getting
it
apart
from
all
questions
of
professional
procedure
is
there
an
obligation
upon
you
to
get
at
the
truth
if
you
put
it
that
way
i
believe
there
is
replied
walters
slowly
and
meditatively
there
was
a
pause
and
then
he
spoke
with
a
sudden
impulse
yes
crewe
you
can
depend
on
me
i
do
my
best
chapter
xxxii
the
public
interest
in
the
holymead
trial
on
the
second
day
was
even
greater
than
on
the
first
it
was
realised
that
kemp
evidence
had
given
an
unexpected
turn
to
the
proceedings
and
that
if
it
could
be
substantiated
the
jury
verdict
would
be
not
guilty
there
were
confident
persons
who
insisted
that
kemp
evidence
was
sufficient
to
acquit
the
prisoner
but
every
one
grasped
the
fact
that
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
by
his
action
in
applying
for
an
adjournment
of
the
of
kemp
clearly
realised
that
his
case
was
in
danger
if
the
evidence
of
the
first
witness
for
the
defence
could
not
be
broken
down
the
public
appetite
for
sensation
having
been
whetted
by
sensational
newspaper
reports
of
the
latest
phase
of
the
riversbrook
mystery
there
was
a
great
rush
of
people
to
the
old
bailey
early
on
the
morning
of
the
second
day
to
witness
the
final
stages
of
the
trial
the
queue
in
newgate
street
commenced
to
assemble
at
daybreak
and
grew
longer
and
longer
as
the
day
wore
on
but
it
was
composed
of
persons
who
did
not
know
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
possibility
of
their
gaining
admittance
to
number
one
court
the
policeman
who
was
invested
with
the
duty
of
keeping
the
queue
close
to
the
wall
of
the
building
forbore
to
break
this
sad
news
to
them
being
faithful
to
the
limitations
of
the
official
mind
he
believed
that
the
right
thing
to
do
was
to
let
the
people
in
the
queue
receive
this
important
information
from
the
sergeant
inside
how
was
he
to
know
without
authority
from
his
superior
officer
that
any
of
these
people
wanted
to
be
admitted
to
number
one
court
so
the
policeman
pared
his
nails
gallantly
minding
the
places
of
pretty
girls
in
the
queue
who
worn
out
by
hours
of
waiting
in
the
cold
desired
to
slip
away
to
a
neighbouring
to
get
a
cup
of
tea
before
the
court
opened
and
sternly
rebuking
enterprising
youths
who
endeavoured
to
wedge
themselves
in
ahead
of
their
proper
place
the
body
of
the
court
was
packed
before
the
proceedings
commenced
the
number
of
ladies
present
was
even
greater
than
on
the
first
day
and
the
resources
of
the
ushers
were
severely
taxed
to
find
accommodation
for
them
all
in
the
back
row
crewe
noticed
holymead
accompanied
by
mademoiselle
chiron
they
had
not
been
in
court
on
the
previous
day
holymead
seemed
anxious
to
escape
notice
but
crewe
could
see
that
although
she
looked
anxious
and
distressed
she
was
buoyed
up
by
a
new
hope
which
doubtless
had
come
to
her
since
kemp
had
given
his
evidence
there
was
an
expectant
silence
in
the
court
when
justice
hodson
took
his
seat
and
the
names
of
the
jurymen
were
called
over
kemp
entered
the
with
a
more
confident
air
than
he
had
worn
the
previous
day
walters
rose
to
begin
his
and
the
witness
faced
the
barrister
with
the
air
of
an
old
hand
who
knew
the
game
and
was
not
to
be
caught
by
any
legal
tricks
or
traps
you
said
yesterday
witness
commenced
walters
adjusting
his
glasses
and
glancing
from
his
brief
to
the
witness
and
from
the
witness
back
to
the
brief
again
that
you
saw
the
prisoner
enter
the
gate
at
riversbrook
about
on
the
night
of
the
of
august
yes
the
monosyllable
was
flung
out
as
insolently
as
possible
the
speaker
watched
his
interrogator
with
the
lowering
eyes
of
a
man
at
war
with
society
and
who
realised
that
he
was
facing
one
of
his
natural
enemies
did
he
see
you
no
you
are
quite
sure
of
that
have
i
just
said
so
do
not
be
insolent
witness
it
was
the
judge
warning
voice
that
broke
into
the
answer
the
questions
how
long
was
it
after
the
prisoner
entered
the
carriage
drive
that
you
went
to
the
edge
of
the
plantation
and
heard
voices
upstairs
continued
walters
i
went
as
soon
as
holymead
passed
me
how
far
were
you
from
the
house
about
sixty
yards
and
from
that
distance
you
could
hear
the
voices
yes
plainly
not
very
i
could
hear
the
voices
but
i
could
hear
what
they
were
saying
were
they
angry
voices
they
seemed
to
me
to
be
talking
loudly
yet
you
could
hear
what
they
were
saying
no
i
was
sixty
yards
away
you
said
in
your
evidence
in
chief
that
the
talking
continued
half
an
hour
did
you
time
it
no
then
what
made
you
swear
that
i
said
about
half
an
hour
i
smoked
out
a
pipeful
of
tobacco
while
i
was
standing
there
and
that
would
be
about
half
an
hour
kemp
disclosed
his
broken
teeth
in
a
faint
grin
what
happened
next
i
heard
the
front
door
slam
and
i
saw
somebody
walking
across
the
garden
and
go
into
the
carriage
drive
towards
the
gate
did
you
recognise
who
it
was
yes
mr
holymead
kemp
looked
at
the
prisoner
as
he
gave
the
answer
you
swear
it
was
the
prisoner
i
do
let
me
recall
your
evidence
in
chief
witness
you
swore
that
you
identified
holymead
as
he
went
in
because
he
struck
a
match
to
look
at
the
time
as
he
passed
you
and
you
saw
his
face
did
he
strike
matches
as
he
went
out
no
then
how
are
you
able
to
swear
so
positively
as
to
his
identity
in
the
dark
kemp
considered
a
moment
before
replying
because
i
know
him
well
and
i
was
close
to
him
he
said
at
length
i
was
close
enough
to
him
almost
to
touch
him
i
knew
him
by
his
walk
and
by
the
look
of
him
it
was
him
right
enough
i
swear
to
that
i
put
it
to
you
witness
persisted
counsel
that
you
could
not
positively
identify
a
man
in
a
plantation
at
that
time
of
night
do
you
still
swear
it
was
mr
holymead
i
do
replied
kemp
doggedly
what
did
you
do
then
i
stayed
where
i
was
what
for
i
do
know
i
did
have
any
particular
reason
i
just
stayed
there
watching
did
you
think
the
prisoner
might
return
no
replied
the
witness
quickly
why
should
i
think
that
how
long
did
you
stay
watching
the
house
it
might
be
a
matter
of
ten
minutes
more
and
the
prisoner
did
return
during
that
time
no
replied
the
witness
emphatically
what
did
you
do
after
that
i
went
to
the
tube
station
prisoner
might
have
returned
after
you
left
i
suppose
he
might
replied
the
witness
reluctantly
well
now
witness
you
say
you
stayed
ten
minutes
after
holymead
left
and
during
that
time
sir
horace
opened
the
window
and
leaned
out
of
it
yes
you
saw
him
distinctly
yes
you
are
sure
it
was
sir
horace
fewbanks
yes
now
witness
said
walters
suddenly
changing
his
tone
to
one
of
more
severity
than
he
had
previously
used
you
have
told
us
that
you
heard
sir
horace
fewbanks
and
the
prisoner
in
the
library
while
you
stood
in
the
wood
by
the
garage
and
that
subsequently
you
saw
sir
horace
leaning
out
of
the
window
after
the
prisoner
had
gone
you
are
quite
sure
you
were
able
to
see
and
hear
all
this
from
where
you
stood
yes
are
you
aware
witness
that
there
is
a
large
at
the
side
of
the
library
in
front
of
the
window
kemp
considered
for
a
moment
yes
he
said
and
did
not
that
tree
obstruct
your
view
of
the
library
window
no
witness
said
walters
solemnly
listen
to
me
this
tree
did
not
obstruct
your
view
when
you
went
to
riversbrook
a
week
or
so
ago
to
decide
on
the
nature
of
the
evidence
you
would
give
in
this
court
it
is
bare
of
leaves
now
and
you
could
see
the
library
window
and
even
see
into
the
library
from
where
you
stood
but
i
put
it
to
you
that
on
the
of
august
when
this
tree
was
covered
with
its
summer
foliage
you
could
no
more
have
seen
the
library
window
behind
its
branches
than
you
could
have
seen
the
inhabitants
of
mars
what
answer
have
you
got
to
that
witness
there
was
a
slight
stir
in
court
an
expression
of
the
feeling
of
tension
among
the
spectators
kemp
drew
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
lips
then
moistened
his
lips
with
his
tongue
come
witness
give
me
an
answer
thundered
prosecuting
counsel
i
tell
you
i
saw
him
after
holymead
had
left
declared
kemp
defiantly
his
voice
had
suddenly
become
hoarse
to
the
surprise
of
the
members
of
the
legal
profession
who
were
in
court
walters
instead
of
pressing
home
his
advantage
switched
off
to
something
else
i
believe
you
have
a
feeling
of
gratitude
towards
the
prisoner
he
asked
in
a
milder
tone
i
have
said
kemp
his
defiant
insolent
attitude
had
suddenly
vanished
and
he
gave
the
impression
of
a
man
who
feared
that
every
question
contained
a
trap
he
did
something
for
a
relative
of
yours
which
at
that
time
greatly
relieved
your
mind
he
did
and
i
never
forget
it
well
we
wo
go
further
into
that
at
present
but
it
is
a
fact
that
you
would
like
to
do
him
a
good
turn
yes
you
came
here
with
the
intention
of
doing
him
a
good
turn
kemp
considered
for
a
moment
before
answering
yes
you
came
here
with
the
intention
of
giving
evidence
that
would
get
him
off
yes
you
came
here
with
the
intention
of
committing
perjury
in
order
to
get
him
off
walters
waited
but
there
was
no
reply
to
the
question
and
he
added
you
see
what
your
perjured
evidence
has
done
for
him
what
has
it
done
asked
kemp
sullenly
it
has
established
the
prisoner
guilt
beyond
all
reasonable
doubt
in
the
minds
of
men
of
common
sense
you
did
not
see
sir
horace
fewbanks
that
night
after
the
prisoner
left
him
you
could
not
have
seen
him
even
if
he
had
leaned
out
of
the
window
but
your
whole
story
is
a
lie
because
sir
horace
was
dead
when
the
prisoner
left
him
he
was
not
shouted
kemp
i
saw
him
alive
i
saw
him
as
plain
as
i
see
you
now
the
man
in
court
who
was
most
fascinated
by
the
witness
was
crewe
he
had
watched
every
movement
of
kemp
face
every
change
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
i
wonder
what
the
fool
will
say
next
whispered
inspector
chippenfield
to
crewe
he
will
tell
us
how
sir
horace
fewbanks
was
shot
was
crewe
reply
walters
approached
a
step
nearer
to
the
you
saw
him
as
plainly
as
you
see
me
now
he
repeated
yes
declared
kemp
who
it
was
evident
was
labouring
under
great
excitement
you
say
i
came
here
to
commit
perjury
if
it
would
get
him
off
he
pointed
with
a
dramatic
finger
to
the
man
in
the
dock
i
did
and
i
came
here
to
get
him
off
by
telling
the
truth
if
perjury
did
do
it
you
say
i
helped
to
put
the
rope
round
his
neck
but
i
man
enough
to
tell
the
truth
i
get
him
off
even
if
i
have
to
swing
for
it
myself
this
outburst
from
the
created
a
sensation
in
court
many
of
the
spectators
stood
up
in
order
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
witness
and
some
of
the
ladies
even
jumped
on
their
seats
justice
hodson
was
momentarily
taken
aback
his
first
instinct
was
to
check
the
witness
and
to
ask
him
to
be
calm
but
the
witness
took
no
notice
of
him
he
displayed
his
judicial
authority
by
an
impressive
descent
of
an
uplifted
hand
which
compelled
the
unruly
spectators
to
resume
their
seats
it
was
on
walters
that
kemp
concentrated
his
attention
it
was
walters
whom
he
set
himself
to
convince
as
if
he
were
the
man
who
could
set
the
prisoner
free
of
the
rest
of
the
people
in
court
kemp
in
his
excitement
had
become
oblivious
listen
to
me
said
kemp
and
i
tell
you
who
shot
this
scoundrel
he
was
a
scoundrel
i
say
and
he
ought
to
have
been
in
gaol
himself
instead
of
sending
other
people
there
i
went
up
to
the
house
that
night
to
see
if
everything
was
clear
or
whether
that
cur
hill
had
laid
a
trap
that
part
of
my
evidence
is
true
and
from
behind
a
tree
in
the
plantation
i
saw
holymead
pass
me
he
struck
a
match
to
look
at
the
time
and
i
saw
his
face
distinctly
a
few
minutes
afterwards
i
heard
loud
angry
voices
coming
from
somewhere
upstairs
in
the
house
i
thought
the
best
thing
i
could
do
was
to
find
out
what
it
was
about
i
said
to
myself
that
holymead
might
want
help
i
walked
across
the
garden
and
found
that
the
hall
door
was
wide
open
i
went
inside
and
crept
upstairs
to
the
library
the
light
in
the
hall
was
turned
on
as
well
as
a
little
lamp
on
the
turn
of
the
staircase
behind
a
marble
figure
holding
some
curtains
which
led
the
way
to
the
library
the
library
door
was
open
an
inch
or
two
and
i
listened
i
could
hear
them
quite
plainly
holymead
was
telling
him
what
he
thought
of
him
and
no
wonder
it
made
my
blood
boil
to
think
of
such
a
scoundrel
sitting
on
the
bench
and
sentencing
better
men
than
himself
i
thought
of
the
way
in
which
he
had
killed
my
girl
by
giving
her
five
years
it
was
the
shock
that
killed
her
five
years
for
stealing
nothing
for
she
did
handle
the
jewels
and
here
he
had
been
stealing
a
man
wife
and
nothing
said
except
what
holymead
called
him
i
stood
there
listening
in
case
they
started
to
fight
and
i
might
be
wanted
but
they
did
i
heard
holymead
step
towards
the
door
and
i
slipped
away
from
where
i
had
been
standing
i
saw
the
door
of
another
room
near
me
and
i
opened
it
and
went
in
quickly
i
closed
the
door
behind
me
but
i
did
not
shut
it
i
looked
through
the
crack
and
saw
holymead
making
his
way
downstairs
he
walked
as
if
he
did
see
anything
and
i
watched
him
till
he
went
through
the
curtains
on
the
stairs
at
the
bend
of
the
staircase
and
i
could
see
him
no
more
then
i
heard
a
step
and
looking
through
the
crack
i
saw
the
judge
coming
out
of
the
library
he
walked
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
began
to
walk
slowly
down
them
but
when
he
reached
the
bend
where
the
curtains
and
the
marble
figure
were
he
turned
round
and
walked
up
the
stairs
again
he
walked
along
as
though
he
was
thinking
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
nodding
his
head
a
little
and
a
little
cruel
crafty
smile
on
his
face
he
passed
so
close
to
me
that
i
could
have
touched
him
by
putting
out
my
hand
and
he
went
into
the
library
again
leaving
the
door
open
behind
him
then
suddenly
as
i
stood
there
the
thought
came
over
me
to
go
in
to
him
and
tell
him
what
i
thought
about
him
i
opened
the
door
softly
so
as
not
to
frighten
him
and
walked
out
into
the
passage
and
into
the
library
and
as
i
did
so
i
took
my
revolver
out
of
my
pocket
and
carried
it
in
my
hand
i
was
going
to
shoot
him
but
i
meant
to
hold
him
up
while
i
told
him
the
truth
he
was
standing
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
with
his
back
towards
me
and
a
book
in
his
hand
but
a
board
creaked
as
i
stepped
on
it
and
he
swung
round
quickly
he
was
surprised
to
see
me
and
no
mistake
do
you
want
here
he
said
in
a
sharp
voice
and
i
could
see
by
the
way
he
eyed
the
revolver
that
he
was
frightened
then
i
opened
out
on
him
and
told
him
off
for
the
damned
scoundrel
he
was
and
he
did
like
that
either
he
edged
away
to
a
corner
but
i
kept
following
him
round
the
room
telling
him
what
i
thought
of
him
and
seeing
him
so
frightened
i
put
the
revolver
back
in
my
pocket
and
walked
close
to
him
while
i
told
him
all
the
things
i
could
think
of
as
i
thought
of
my
poor
girl
that
he
killed
i
grew
savage
and
i
told
him
that
i
had
a
good
mind
to
break
every
bone
in
his
body
he
threatened
to
have
me
arrested
for
breaking
into
the
place
but
i
only
laughed
and
hit
him
across
the
face
he
backed
away
from
me
with
a
wicked
look
in
his
eyes
and
i
followed
him
he
backed
quickly
towards
the
door
and
before
i
knew
what
game
he
was
up
to
he
made
a
dart
out
of
the
room
but
i
was
too
quick
for
him
i
got
him
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
dragged
him
back
into
the
room
and
shut
the
door
and
stood
with
my
back
against
it
i
told
him
i
had
finished
with
him
i
had
mastered
him
so
quickly
and
was
able
to
handle
him
so
easily
that
i
did
watch
him
as
closely
as
i
ought
to
have
done
he
had
backed
away
to
his
desk
with
his
hand
behind
him
and
suddenly
he
brought
it
up
with
a
revolver
in
his
hand
it
my
turn
he
said
to
me
with
his
cunning
smile
throw
up
your
hands
i
saw
then
it
was
man
for
man
if
i
let
him
take
me
i
was
in
for
a
good
seven
years
i
sooner
be
dead
than
do
seven
years
for
him
and
be
damned
i
said
i
ducked
as
i
spoke
and
as
i
ducked
i
made
a
dive
with
my
hand
for
my
hip
pocket
where
i
had
put
my
revolver
he
fired
and
missed
he
fired
again
but
his
toy
revolver
missed
fire
for
i
heard
the
hammer
click
but
that
was
his
last
chance
i
fired
at
his
heart
and
he
dropped
beside
the
desk
i
did
wait
for
anything
more
i
bolted
i
got
tangled
in
the
staircase
curtains
and
fell
down
the
stairs
as
i
was
falling
i
thought
what
a
nice
trap
i
would
be
in
if
i
broke
my
leg
and
had
to
lie
there
until
the
police
came
but
i
was
much
hurt
and
i
got
up
and
dashed
out
of
the
house
and
over
the
fence
into
the
wood
the
way
i
came
he
stopped
and
his
gaze
wandered
round
the
hushed
court
till
it
rested
on
the
prisoner
who
with
his
hands
grasping
the
rail
of
the
dock
had
leaned
forward
in
order
to
catch
every
word
kemp
turned
his
gaze
from
the
man
in
the
dock
to
the
man
in
the
scarlet
robe
on
the
bench
and
it
was
to
the
judge
that
he
addressed
his
concluding
words
you
can
call
it
murder
you
can
call
it
manslaughter
you
can
call
it
justifiable
homicide
you
can
call
it
what
you
like
but
what
i
say
is
that
the
man
you
have
in
the
dock
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
was
me
that
killed
him
let
him
go
and
put
me
in
his
place
he
held
his
hands
outstretched
with
the
wrists
together
as
though
waiting
for
the
handcuffs
to
be
placed
on
them
chapter
xxxiii
an
hour
after
the
trial
crewe
entered
the
chambers
of
walters
i
congratulate
you
on
the
way
you
handled
him
in
the
said
crewe
who
was
warmly
welcomed
by
the
barrister
you
did
splendidly
to
get
it
all
out
of
him
and
so
dramatically
too
i
think
it
is
you
who
deserves
all
the
congratulations
replied
walters
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
there
would
not
have
been
such
a
sensational
development
at
the
trial
and
in
all
probability
evidence
would
have
got
holymead
off
yes
i
glad
to
think
that
holymead
would
have
got
off
even
if
i
seen
through
kemp
replied
crewe
thoughtfully
i
made
a
bad
mistake
in
being
so
confident
that
he
was
the
guilty
man
the
completeness
of
the
circumstantial
evidence
against
him
was
extraordinary
said
walters
to
whom
the
legal
aspects
of
the
case
appealed
personally
i
am
inclined
to
blame
holymead
himself
for
the
predicament
in
which
he
was
placed
if
he
had
gone
to
the
police
after
the
murder
was
discovered
told
them
the
story
of
his
visit
to
sir
horace
that
night
and
invited
investigation
into
the
truth
of
it
all
would
have
been
well
no
said
crewe
in
a
voice
which
indicated
a
determination
not
to
have
himself
absolved
at
the
expense
of
another
the
fact
that
he
did
not
do
what
he
ought
to
have
done
does
not
mitigate
my
sin
of
having
had
the
wrong
man
arrested
the
mistake
i
made
was
in
not
going
to
see
him
before
the
warrant
was
taken
out
if
i
had
had
a
quiet
talk
with
him
i
think
i
would
have
been
able
to
discover
a
flaw
in
my
case
against
him
what
made
me
confident
it
was
flawless
was
the
fact
that
both
his
wife
and
her
french
cousin
believed
him
to
be
guilty
mademoiselle
chiron
followed
holymead
from
the
country
on
the
of
august
with
the
intention
of
averting
a
tragedy
she
arrived
at
riversbrook
too
late
for
that
but
in
time
to
see
sir
horace
expire
and
naturally
she
thought
that
holymead
had
shot
him
when
holymead
realised
that
i
also
suspected
her
husband
and
had
accumulated
some
evidence
against
him
she
sent
mademoiselle
chiron
to
me
with
a
concocted
story
of
how
the
murder
had
been
committed
by
a
more
or
less
mythical
husband
belonging
to
mademoiselle
past
ostensibly
the
reason
for
the
visit
of
this
extremely
clever
french
girl
was
to
induce
me
to
deal
with
rolfe
who
had
begun
to
suspect
holymead
of
some
complicity
in
the
crime
but
the
real
reason
was
to
convince
me
that
i
was
on
the
wrong
track
in
suspecting
holymead
of
course
she
said
nothing
to
me
on
that
point
she
produced
evidence
which
convinced
me
that
she
was
in
the
room
when
sir
horace
died
and
as
i
was
quite
sure
that
she
believed
holymead
to
be
guilty
i
felt
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
whatever
of
his
guilt
it
is
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
cases
on
record
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
trials
said
walters
you
blame
yourself
for
having
had
holymead
arrested
but
you
have
more
than
redeemed
yourself
by
the
final
discovery
when
kemp
was
in
the
that
he
was
the
guilty
man
that
was
an
inspiration
hardly
that
said
crewe
with
a
smile
i
knew
when
he
swore
that
he
had
seen
sir
horace
leaning
out
of
the
library
window
that
he
was
lying
after
the
murder
was
discovered
i
inspected
the
house
and
grounds
carefully
and
one
of
the
first
things
of
which
i
took
a
mental
note
was
the
fact
that
the
foliage
of
the
completely
hid
the
only
window
of
the
library
ah
but
there
is
a
difference
between
knowing
kemp
was
committing
perjury
and
knowing
that
he
was
the
guilty
man
there
is
at
least
a
distinct
connection
between
the
two
facts
said
crewe
who
after
his
mistake
in
regard
to
holymead
was
reluctant
to
accept
any
praise
kemp
description
of
the
way
in
which
sir
horace
was
dressed
showed
that
he
had
seen
him
the
inference
that
kemp
had
been
inside
the
house
was
irresistible
sir
horace
had
arrived
home
at
and
it
was
not
likely
that
kemp
would
hang
about
riversbrook
the
scene
of
a
prospective
burglary
until
after
dark
which
at
that
time
of
the
year
would
be
about
he
must
have
seen
sir
horace
after
dark
and
in
order
to
be
able
to
say
how
the
judge
was
dressed
he
must
have
seen
him
at
close
quarters
the
rest
was
a
matter
of
simple
deduction
kemp
inside
the
house
listening
to
the
angry
interview
between
holymead
and
fewbanks
kemp
with
his
hatred
of
the
judge
who
had
killed
his
daughter
in
the
dock
and
with
his
desire
to
do
holymead
a
good
turn
i
had
previously
had
proof
of
that
from
my
boy
joe
whom
you
have
seen
besides
kemp
fitted
into
my
reconstruction
of
the
tragedy
on
the
vital
question
of
time
how
long
did
sir
horace
live
after
being
shot
the
medical
opinions
i
was
able
to
obtain
on
the
point
varied
but
after
sifting
them
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
though
he
might
have
lived
for
half
an
hour
it
was
more
probable
that
he
had
died
within
ten
minutes
of
being
hit
how
is
that
vital
asked
walters
who
was
keenly
interested
in
understanding
how
crewe
had
arrived
at
his
conviction
of
kemp
guilt
holymead
appointment
with
sir
horace
at
riversbrook
was
for
the
letter
found
in
sir
horace
fixed
that
time
it
was
exactly
when
he
got
into
a
taxi
at
hyde
park
corner
after
his
visit
to
riversbrook
on
that
point
the
driver
of
the
taxi
was
absolutely
certain
i
was
so
anxious
for
him
to
make
it
that
i
went
to
see
him
twice
about
it
assuming
that
holymead
arrived
at
riversbrook
at
i
allowed
half
an
hour
for
his
angry
interview
with
sir
horace
half
an
hour
for
the
walk
from
riversbrook
to
hampstead
tube
station
and
half
an
hour
for
the
journey
from
hampstead
to
hyde
park
corner
which
would
have
involved
a
change
at
leicester
square
as
i
could
not
induce
the
driver
of
the
taxi
to
make
holymead
appearance
at
hyde
park
corner
instead
of
i
had
to
admit
that
holymead
must
have
left
riversbrook
at
but
it
was
according
to
mademoiselle
chiron
when
she
found
sir
horace
dying
on
the
floor
of
the
library
therefore
if
holymead
did
the
shooting
the
victim
death
agonies
must
have
lasted
half
an
hour
or
more
medically
that
was
not
impossible
but
somewhat
improbable
but
a
meeting
between
kemp
and
sir
horace
after
holymead
had
gone
filled
in
the
blank
in
time
that
came
home
to
me
yesterday
when
kemp
was
in
the
committing
perjury
in
his
determination
to
get
holymead
off
i
take
it
that
the
interview
between
kemp
and
his
victim
lasted
about
minutes
therefore
sir
horace
was
shot
about
certainly
before
for
mademoiselle
heard
no
shots
while
nearing
the
house
you
have
worked
it
out
very
ingeniously
said
walters
you
must
find
the
work
of
crime
detection
very
fascinating
i
am
afraid
that
if
i
had
been
in
your
place
that
is
if
i
had
known
as
much
about
the
tragedy
as
you
do
when
kemp
was
in
the
yesterday
i
would
not
have
seen
anything
more
in
his
evidence
than
the
fact
that
he
was
committing
perjury
in
order
to
help
holymead
i
think
you
would
said
crewe
these
discoveries
come
to
one
naturally
as
the
result
of
training
one
mind
in
a
particular
direction
they
come
to
you
but
they
would
come
to
me
said
walters
with
a
smile
but
do
you
think
kemp
story
of
how
sir
horace
was
shot
is
literally
true
do
you
think
sir
horace
got
in
the
first
shot
and
then
tried
to
fire
again
if
that
is
so
i
do
see
how
they
can
hope
to
convict
kemp
of
murder
a
jury
would
not
go
beyond
a
verdict
of
manslaughter
in
such
a
case
you
handled
kemp
so
well
that
he
was
too
excited
to
tell
anything
but
the
truth
said
crewe
sir
horace
fired
first
and
missed
the
bullet
which
chippenfield
removed
from
the
wall
of
the
library
shows
that
and
he
pulled
the
trigger
again
but
the
cartridge
which
had
been
in
the
revolver
for
a
considerable
time
probably
for
years
missed
fire
here
is
a
silent
witness
to
the
truth
of
that
part
of
kemp
story
crewe
produced
from
a
waistcoat
pocket
one
of
the
four
cartridges
he
had
removed
from
the
revolver
mademoiselle
chiron
had
handed
to
him
and
he
placed
it
on
the
table
on
the
cap
of
the
cartridge
was
a
mark
where
the
hammer
had
struck
without
exploding
the
powder
