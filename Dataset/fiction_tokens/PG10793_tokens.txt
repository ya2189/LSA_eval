over

as
fine
a
zulu
as

over

there
while

considering
that

only
just
buried

found

quite
skittish
enough
and

when
she
got
over
her
grief
a
bit
more
the
manager
and
george
said
he
got
on
wonderfully
and
arter
talking
it
over
with
alfredi
they
decided
to
open
that
evening
and
pore
rupert
found
out
that
the
shop
was
the
theatre
and
all
the
acting
got
to
do
was
to
dance
and
sing
in
zulu
to
people
wot
had
paid
a
penny
a
he
was
a
bit
nervous
at
fust
for
fear
anybody
should
find
out
that
was
a
real
zulu
because
the
manager
said
they
tear
to
pieces
if
they
did
and
eat
arterwards
but
arter
a
time
nervousness
wore
off
and
he
jumped
about
like
a
monkey
they
gave
performances
every
arf
hour
from
six
to
ten
and
rupert
felt
ready
to
drop
his
feet
was
sore
with
dancing
and
his
throat
ached
with
singing
zulu
but
wot
upset
more
than
anything
was
an
elderly
old
party
wot
would
keep
jabbing
in
the
ribs
with
her
umbrella
to
see
whether
he
could
laugh

elderly
old
party
wot
would
keep

her
umbrella
they
supper
arter
they
closed
and
then
alfredi
and
wife
went
off
and
rupert
and
george
made
up
beds
for
themselves
in
the
shop
while
kumbo
a
little
place
to
herself
at
the
back
he
did
better
than
ever
next
night
and
they
all
said
he
was
improving
fast
and
alfredi
told
in
a
whisper
that
he
thought
he
was
better
at
it
than
kumbo
that
i
should
mind
knowing
much
he
ses
that
she
took
such
a
fancy
to
i
was
going
to
speak
to
you
about
that
ses
rupert
is
no
name
for
it
if
she
do
keep
to
i
shall
chuck
the
whole
thing
the
manager
coughed
behind
his
go
back
to
the
army

ses
i
should
be
sorry
to
lose
you
but
i
wo
stand
in
your
alfredi
wot
was
standing
by
stuffed
her
in
mouth
and
rupert
began
to
feel
a
bit
uneasy
in
his
mind
i
did
he
ses
get
into
trouble
for
me
to
ses
alfredi
do
know
anything
about
your
ses
rupert

find
somewhere
ses
rupert
might
ketch
your
death

cold
though
ses
george
rupert
said
he
did
mind
and
then
he
shut
eyes
and
pretended
to
be
asleep
his
idea
was
to
wait
till
george
was
asleep
and
then
pinch
clothes
consequently
feelings
when
opened
one
eye
and
saw
george
getting
into

with
clothes
on
wo
bear
thinking
about

laid
awake
for
hours
and
three
times
that
night
george
who
was
a
very
heavy
sleeper
woke
up
and
found
rupert
busy
tucking
him
in
by
the
end
of
the
week
rupert
was
getting
desperate
he
hated
being
black
for
one
thing
and
the
more
he
washed
the
better
color
he
looked
he
did
mind
the
black
for
out
o
doors
in
case
the
army
was
looking
for
but
no
clothes
he
could
get
out
o
doors
and
when
he
said
he
would
perform
unless
he
got
some

about
having
took
up
for
a
deserter

suspicions
of

for
some
days

ses
with
a
wink

did
come
to
me
in
a
nice
serge
suit
and
tell
me

shaking
his
and
said
that
george
been
drinking
agin
wot
about
my
clothes
ses
rupert
hardly
able
to
speak
he
did
buy
arter
all
ses
the
manager
try
he
tried
fust
and
found
some
strawberries
that
george
spoilt
by
sitting
on
then
he
told
rupert
to
have
a
try
and
rupert
found
some
bits
of
string
a
few
buttons
two
penny
stamps
and
twopence
in
coppers
mind
ses
alfredi
go
round
to
the
in
the
morning
the
boy
taken
them
there
i
in
george
i
shall
tell
so
he
bid
rupert
and
went
off
with
alfredi
and
rupert
wishful
to
make
the
best
o
things
decided
that
he
would
undress
george
and
go
off
in
clothes
he
waited
till
kumbo
gone
off
to
bed
and
then
he
started
to
take
george
coat
off
he
got
the
two
top
buttons
undone
all
right
and
then
george
turned
over
in
sleep
it
surprised
rupert
but
wot
surprised
more
when
he
rolled
george
over
was
to
find
them
two
buttons
done
up
agin
arter
it
had
three
times
he
see
it
was
and
he
come
to
the
belief
that
george
was
no
more
drunk
than
wot
he
was
and
that
it
was
all
a
thing
between
and
alfredi
he
went
to
bed
then
to
think
it
over
and
by
the
morning
he
made
up
his
mind
to
keep
quiet
and
bide
his
time
as
the
saying
is
he
spoke
quite
cheerful
to
alfredi
and
pretended
to
believe
when
he
said
that
he
been
to
the
about
the
clothes
two
days
arterwards
he
thought
of
something
he
remembered
me
he
found
a
dirty
old
envelope
on
the
floor
and
with
a
bit
o
lead
pencil
he
wrote
me
a
letter
on
the
back
of
one
o
the
bills
telling
me
all
his
troubles
and
asking
me
to
bring
some
clothes
and
rescue
he
stuck
on
one
of
the
stamps
he
found
in
george
pocket
and
opening
the
door
just
afore
going
to
bed
threw
it
out
on
the
pavement
the
world
is
full
of
officious
interfering
i
should
no
more
think
of
posting
a
letter
that
did
belong
to
me
with
an
unused
stamp
on
it
than
i
should
think
o
flying
but
some
son
of
a
gun
posted
that
letter
and
i
got
it
i
was
never
more
surprised
in
my
life
he
asked
me
to
be
outside
the
shop
next
night
at
eleven
with
any
old
clothes
i
could
pick
up
if
i
did
he
said
he
should
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
and
that
his
ghost
would
sit
on
the
wharf
and
keep
watch
with
me
every
night
for
the
rest
o
my
life
he
said
he
expected
it
have
a
black
face
same
as
in
life
a
wharf
is
a
lonely
place
of
a
night
especially
our
wharf
which
is
full
of
dark
corners
and
being
a
silly
fool
i
went
i
got
a
pal
off
of
one
of
the
boats
to
keep
watch
for
me
and
arter
getting
some
old
rags
off
of
another
sailorman
as
owed
me
arf
a
dollar
i
a
drink
and
started
off
for
the
mile
end
road
i
found
the
place
easy
enough
the
door
was
just
on
the
jar
and
as
i
tapped
on
it
with
my
a
black
man
arf
naked
opened
it
and
said
and
pulled
me
inside
there
was
a
bit
candle
on
the
floor
shaded
by
a
box
and
a
man
fast
asleep
and
snoring
up
in
one
corner
rupert
dressed
like
lightning
and
he
just
put
on
cap
when
the
door
at
the
back
opened
and
a
fat
black
woman
came
out
and
began
to
chatter
rupert
told
her
to
hush
and
she
and
then
he
waved
hand
to
to
say
and
afore
you
could
say
jack
robinson
she
grabbed
up
a
bit
o
dirty
blanket
a
bundle
of
assegais
and
a
spear
and
come
out
arter
us
ses
rupert
in
a
whisper
pointing
ses
rupert
in
a
whisper
pointing
kumbo
shook
her
and
then
he
took
hold
of
and
tried
to
shove
back
but
she
would
go
i
lent
him
a
but
all
wimmen
are
the
same
black
or
white
and
afore
i
knew
where
i
was
she
clawed
my
cap
off
and
scratched
me
all
down
one
side
of
the
face
fast
ses
rupert
i
started
to
run
but
it
was
all
no
good
kumbo
kept
up
with
us
easy
and
she
was
so
pleased
at
being
out
in
the
open
air
that
she
began
to
dance
and
play
about
like
a
kitten
instead
o
minding
their
own
business
people
turned
and
follered
us
and
quite
a
crowd
collected
shall
the
police
in
a
minute
ses
rupert
in
he
pointed
to
a
pub
up
a
side
street
and
went
in
with
kumbo
holding
on
to
his
arm
the
barman
was
for
sending
us
out
at
fust
but
such
a
crowd
follered
us
in
that
he
altered
mind
i
ordered
three
pints
and
while
i
was
rupert
his
kumbo
finished
and
began
on
mine
i
tried
to
explain
but
she
held
on
to
it
like
grim
death
and
in
the
confusion
rupert
slipped
out
he
been
gone
five
seconds
afore
she
missed
and
i
never
see
anybody
so
upset
in
all
my
life
she
spilt
the
beer
all
down
the
place
where
bodice
ought
to
ha
been
and
then
she
dropped
the
pot
and
went
arter
like
a
hare
i
follered
in
a
different
way
and
when
i
got
round
the
corner
i
found
she
caught
and
was
holding
by
the
arm
o
course
the
crowd
was
round
us
agin
and
to
get
rid
of
i
did
a
thing
i
seldom
done
called
a
cab
and
we
all
bundled
in
and
drove
off
to
the
wharf
with
the
spear
sticking
out
o
the
window
and
most
of
the
assegais
sticking
into
me
is
getting
serious
ses
rupert
i
ses
wot
i
done
to
be
dragged
into
it
you
must
been
paying
some
attention
to
make
carry
on
like
i
thought
rupert
would
ha
bust
and
the
things
he
said
to
the
man
wot
was
spending
money
like
water
to
rescue
was
disgraceful
we
got
to
the
wharf
at
last
and
i
was
glad
to
see
that
my
pal
got
tired
of
and
gone
off
leaving
the
gate
open
kumbo
went
in
on
to
rupert
arm
and
i
follered
with
the
spear
which
i
held
in
my
while
i
paid
the
cabman
they
went
into
the
office
and
rupert
and
me
talked
it
over
while
kumbo
kept
patting
cheek
he
was
afraid
that
the
manager
would
track
to
the
wharf
and
i
was
afraid
that
the
would
find
out
that
i
been
neglecting
my
dooty
for
the
fust
time
in
my
life
we
talked
all
night
pretty
near
and
then
at
five
arf
an
hour
afore
the
came
on
i
made
up
my
mind
to
fetch
a
cab
and
drive
to
my
i
wanted
rupert
to
go
somewhere
else
but
said
he
got
nowhere
else
to
go
and
it
was
the
only
thing
to
get
off
the
wharf
i
opened
the
gates
at
ten
minutes
to
six
and
just
as
the
fust
man
come
on
and
walked
down
the
wharf
we
slipped
in
and
drove
away
we
was
all
tired
and
yawning
there
something
about
the
motion
of
a
cab
or
an
omnibus
that
always
makes
me
feel
sleepy
and
arter
a
time
i
closed
my
eyes
and
went
off
sound
i
remember
i
was
dreaming
that
i
found
a
bag
o
money
when
the
cab
pulled
up
with
a
jerk
in
front
of
my
and
woke
me
up
opposite
me
sat
kumbo
fast
asleep
and
rupert
disappeared
i
was
dazed
for
a
moment
and
afore
i
could
do
anything
kumbo
woke
up
and
missed
rupert
wot
made
matters
worse
than
anything
was
that
my
missis
was
kneeling
down
in
the
passage
doing
and
face
as
i
got
down
out
o
that
cab
with
kumbo
on
to
my
arm
was
something
too
awful
for
words
it
seemed
to
rise
up
from
near
the
and
to
go
on
rising
till
i
thought
it
never
stop
and
every
inch
it
rose
it
got
worse
and
worse
to
look
at
she
stood
blocking
up
the
doorway
with
her
on
her
she
stood
blocking
up
the
doorway
with
her
on
her
while
i
explained
with
kumbo
still
on
my
arm
and
a
crowd
collecting
behind
and
the
more
i
explained
the
more
i
could
see
she
believe
a
word
of
it
she
never
believed
it
i
sent
for
alfredi
to
come
and
take
kumbo
away
and
when
i
spoke
to
about
rupert
he
said
i
was
dreaming
and
asked
me
whether
i
was
ashamed
o
myself
for
carrying
off
a
pore
black
gal
wot
got
no
father
or
mother
to
look
arter
her
he
said
that
afore
my
missis
and
my
character
been
under
a
cloud
ever
since
waiting
for
rupert
to
turn
up
and
clear
it
away
homeward
bound
hatchard
conversation
for
nearly
a
week
had
been
confined
to
and
grunts
a
system
of
treatment
designed
to
wean
hatchard
from
her
besetting
sin
of
extravagance
on
other
occasions
the
treatment
had
for
short
periods
proved
successful
but
it
was
quite
evident
that
his
wife
constitution
was
becoming
inured
to
this
physic
and
required
a
change
of
treatment
the
evidence
stared
at
him
from
the
mantelpiece
in
the
shape
of
a
pair
of
huge
pink
vases
which
had
certainly
not
been
there
when
he
left
in
the
morning
he
looked
at
them
and
breathed
heavily
ai
they
said
his
wife
nodding
at
them
gave
to
you
inquired
hatchard
sternly
his
wife
shook
her
head
do
get
vases
like
that
given
to
you
she
said
slowly
i
you
mean
to
say
you
bought
demanded
her
husband
hatchard
nodded
all
i
said
to
you
about
wasting
my
money
persisted
hatchard
in
amazed
accents
hatchard
nodded
more
brightly
than
before
has
got
to
be
an
end
to
this
said
her
husband
desperately
wo
have
it
d
hear
i
bought
with
my
own
money
said
his
wife
tossing
her
head
money
said
hatchard
hear
you
talk
anybody
think
you
got
three
hundred
a
year
instead
o
thirty
your
money
ought
to
be
spent
in
useful
things
same
as
what
mine
is
why
should
i
spend
my
money
keeping
you
while
you
waste
yours
on
pink
vases
and
having
friends
in
to
tea
hatchard
still
comely
face
took
on
a
deeper
tinge
me
she
said
sharply
better
stop
before
you
say
anything
you
might
be
sorry
for
should
have
to
talk
a
long
time
before
i
said
that
retorted
the
other
not
so
sure
said
his
wife
beginning
to
be
tired
of
reasoned
with
you
continued
hatchard
argued
with
you
and
i
pointed
out
the
error
of
your
ways
to
you
and
it
all
no
be
quiet
and
do
talk
nonsense
said
his
wife
continued
hatchard
i
said
before
is
no
good
deeds
not
words
is
what
is
he
rose
suddenly
from
his
chair
and
taking
one
of
the
vases
from
the
mantelpiece
dashed
it
to
pieces
on
the
fender
example
is
contagious
and
two
seconds
later
he
was
in
his
chair
again
softly
feeling
a
rapidly
growing
bump
on
his
head
and
gazing
at
his
wife
taking
one
of
the
vases
from
the
mantelpiece
he
dashed
it
to
pieces
on
the
fender
i
do
it
again
said
that
lady
breathlessly
there
was
another
hatchard
opened
his
mouth
but
speech
failed
him
he
got
up
and
left
the
room
without
a
word
and
making
his
way
to
the
scullery
turned
on
the
tap
and
held
his
head
beneath
it
a
sharp
intake
of
the
breath
announced
that
a
tributary
stream
was
looking
for
the
bump
down
the
neck
of
his
shirt
he
was
away
a
long
long
that
the
hatchard
was
beginning
to
think
of
giving
first
aid
to
the
wounded
then
she
heard
him
coming
slowly
back
along
the
passage
he
entered
the
room
drying
his
wet
hair
on
a
hope
i
did
hurt
said
his
wife
hatchard
drew
himself
up
and
regarded
her
with
lofty
indignation
might
have
killed
me
he
said
at
last
in
thrilling
tones
what
would
you
have
done
up
the
pieces
and
said
you
came
home
injured
and
died
in
my
arms
said
hatchard
glibly
do
want
to
be
unfeeling
but
you
try
the
temper
of
a
saint
i
sure
i
wonder
i
have
done
it
before
why
i
married
a
stingy
man
i
do
i
married
at
all
i
do
know
said
her
husband
in
a
deep
voice
were
both
fools
said
hatchard
in
a
resigned
voice
what
it
was
however
it
ca
be
helped
men
would
go
and
leave
you
said
hatchard
go
said
his
wife
bridling
do
want
talk
nonsense
said
the
other
ai
nonsense
said
hatchard
you
want
to
go
go
i
want
to
keep
only
wish
i
could
said
her
husband
wistfully
the
door
said
hatchard
pointing
to
prevent
you
have
you
going
to
the
magistrate
observed
hatchard
me
was
the
reply
coming
up
full
of
complaints
to
the
me
said
his
wife
again
makes
my
mouth
water
to
think
of
it
said
hatchard
years
ago
i
had
a
care
in
the
neither
said
hatchard
then
i
never
thought
i
should
marry
you
i
remember
the
first
time
i
saw
you
i
had
to
stuff
my
handkerchief
in
my
for
inquired
hatchard
from
laughing
was
the
reply
took
care
not
to
let
me
see
you
laugh
said
hatchard
grimly
were
polite
enough
in
them
days
i
only
wish
i
could
have
my
time
over
again
that
can
go
as
i
said
before
said
his
wife
go
this
minute
said
hatchard
i
know
what
it
be
in
three
or
four
days
you
be
coming
and
begging
me
to
take
you
back
try
me
said
hatchard
with
a
hard
laugh
can
keep
myself
you
leave
me
the
of
it
is
i
worry
you
said
hatchard
raising
his
hand
with
great
solemnity
i
go
i
never
come
back
take
care
of
that
said
his
wife
equably
are
far
more
likely
to
ask
to
come
back
than
i
hatchard
stood
for
some
time
in
deep
thought
and
then
spurred
on
by
a
short
contemptuous
laugh
from
his
wife
went
to
the
small
passage
and
putting
on
his
overcoat
and
hat
stood
in
the
parlor
doorway
regarding
her
a
good
mind
to
take
you
at
your
word
he
said
at
last
said
his
wife
briskly
you
send
me
your
address
send
your
things
on
to
you
there
no
need
for
you
to
call
about
hardly
realizing
the
seriousness
of
the
step
hatchard
closed
the
front
door
behind
him
with
a
bang
and
then
discovered
that
it
was
raining
too
proud
to
return
for
his
umbrella
he
turned
up
his
and
thrusting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
walked
slowly
down
the
desolate
little
street
by
the
time
he
had
walked
a
dozen
yards
he
began
to
think
that
he
might
as
well
have
waited
until
the
morning
before
he
had
walked
fifty
he
was
certain
of
it
he
passed
the
night
at
a
and
rose
so
early
in
the
morning
that
the
proprietor
took
it
as
a
personal
affront
and
advised
him
to
get
his
breakfast
elsewhere
it
was
the
longest
day
in
experience
and
securing
modest
lodgings
that
evening
he
overslept
himself
and
was
late
at
the
warehouse
next
morning
for
the
first
time
in
ten
years
his
personal
effects
arrived
next
day
but
no
letter
came
from
his
wife
and
one
which
he
wrote
concerning
a
pair
of
missing
garments
received
no
reply
he
wrote
again
referring
to
them
in
laudatory
terms
and
got
a
brief
reply
to
the
effect
that
they
had
been
exchanged
in
part
payment
on
a
pair
of
valuable
pink
vases
the
pieces
of
which
he
could
have
by
paying
the
carriage
in
six
weeks
hatchard
changed
his
lodgings
twice
a
lack
of
those
home
comforts
which
he
had
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
during
his
married
life
was
a
source
of
much
tribulation
and
it
was
clear
that
his
weekly
bills
were
compiled
by
a
clever
writer
of
fiction
it
was
his
first
experience
of
lodgings
and
the
difficulty
of
saying
unpleasant
things
to
a
woman
other
than
his
wife
was
not
the
least
of
his
troubles
he
changed
his
lodgings
for
a
third
time
and
much
surprised
at
his
wife
continued
silence
sought
out
a
cousin
of
hers
named
joe
pett
and
poured
his
troubles
into
that
gentleman
reluctant
ear
she
was
to
ask
me
to
take
her
back
he
concluded
not
sure
mind
you
that
i
would
do
does
you
credit
said
pett
i
must
be
i
expect
she
be
very
much
obliged
to
anybody
that
told
her
so
said
hatchard
clutching
at
the
other
sleeve
pett
gazing
into
space
said
that
he
thought
it
highly
probable
wants
to
be
done
cleverly
though
said
hatchard
she
might
get
the
idea
that
i
wanted
to
go
you
know
she
moved
said
pett
with
the
air
of
a
man
anxious
to
change
the
conversation
said
the
other
john
street
said
pett
my
wife
going
to
take
in
lodgers
calling
herself
harris
after
her
maiden
he
went
off
before
hatchard
could
recover
and
the
latter
at
once
verified
the
information
in
part
by
walking
round
to
his
old
house
bits
of
straw
and
paper
littered
the
front
garden
the
blinds
were
down
and
a
bill
was
pasted
on
the
front
parlor
window
aghast
at
such
determination
he
walked
back
to
his
lodgings
in
gloomy
thought
on
saturday
afternoon
he
walked
round
to
john
street
and
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
as
he
passed
stole
a
glance
at
no
he
recognized
the
curtains
at
once
and
seeing
that
there
was
nobody
in
the
room
leaned
over
the
palings
and
peered
at
a
card
that
stood
on
the
furnished
apartments
for
single
young
man
board
if
desired
he
walked
away
whistling
and
after
going
a
little
way
turned
and
passed
it
again
he
passed
in
all
four
times
and
then
with
an
odd
grin
lurking
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
strode
up
to
the
front
door
and
knocked
loudly
he
heard
somebody
moving
about
inside
and
more
with
the
idea
of
keeping
his
courage
up
than
anything
else
gave
another
heavy
knock
at
the
door
it
was
thrown
open
hastily
and
the
astonished
face
of
his
wife
appeared
before
him
do
you
want
she
inquired
sharply
hatchard
raised
his
hat
he
said
politely
do
you
want
repeated
his
wife
called
said
hatchard
clearing
his
called
about
the
bill
in
the
called
about
the
bill
in
the
window
hatchard
clutched
at
the
she
gasped
like
to
see
the
rooms
said
the
other
you
ai
a
single
young
man
said
his
wife
recovering
as
good
as
single
said
hatchard
should
say
ai
young
objected
hatchard
three
years
younger
than
what
you
are
said
hatchard
dispassionately
his
wife
lips
tightened
and
her
hand
closed
on
the
door
hatchard
put
his
foot
in
you
do
want
lodgers
why
do
you
put
a
bill
up
he
inquired
do
take
the
first
that
comes
said
his
wife
pay
a
week
in
advance
said
hatchard
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
course
if
you
afraid
of
having
me
o
giving
way
to
tenderness
i
choked
hatchard
a
matter
o
business
continued
her
husband
my
way
of
looking
at
a
man
way
i
women
are
different
they
in
said
hatchard
breathing
hard
hatchard
obeyed
and
clapping
a
hand
over
his
mouth
ascended
the
stairs
behind
her
at
the
top
she
threw
open
the
door
of
a
tiny
bedroom
and
stood
aside
for
him
to
enter
hatchard
sniffed
critically
rather
stuffy
he
said
at
last
need
have
it
said
his
wife
abruptly
plenty
of
other
fish
in
the
and
i
expect
they
stay
there
if
they
saw
this
room
said
the
other
think
i
want
you
to
have
it
because
i
do
said
hatchard
making
a
preliminary
movement
to
showing
him
downstairs
might
suit
me
said
hatchard
musingly
as
he
peeped
in
at
the
door
should
be
at
home
much
i
a
man
fond
of
spending
his
evenings
hatchard
checking
a
retort
eyed
him
grimly
seen
worse
he
said
slowly
then
i
seen
a
good
many
how
much
are
you
asking
shillings
a
week
replied
his
wife
breakfast
tea
and
supper
a
pound
a
hatchard
nearly
whistled
but
checked
himself
just
in
time
give
it
a
trial
he
said
with
an
air
of
unbearable
patronage
hatchard
hesitated
you
come
here
you
quite
understand
it
on
a
business
footing
she
said
course
said
the
other
with
affected
surprise
do
you
think
i
want
it
on
come
here
as
a
stranger
and
i
look
after
you
as
a
stranger
continued
his
wife
said
the
other
shall
be
made
more
comfortable
that
way
i
sure
but
of
course
if
you
afraid
as
i
said
before
of
giving
way
to
fiddlesticks
interrupted
his
wife
flushing
and
eying
him
angrily
come
in
and
bring
my
things
at
nine
said
hatchard
like
the
windows
open
and
the
rooms
aired
a
bit
and
what
about
the
sheets
about
them
inquired
his
wife
put
me
in
damp
sheets
that
all
said
hatchard
place
i
was
he
broke
off
suddenly
said
his
wife
quickly
very
particular
about
them
said
hatchard
recovering
to
you
want
three
weeks
in
advance
said
his
wife
exclaimed
the
other
weeks
in
advance
are
my
terms
said
hatchard
or
leave
it
would
be
better
if
you
left
hatchard
looked
thoughtful
and
then
with
obvious
reluctance
took
his
purse
from
one
pocket
and
some
silver
from
another
and
made
up
the
required
sum
what
if
i
not
comfortable
here
he
inquired
as
his
wife
hastily
pocketed
the
money
be
your
own
fault
was
the
reply
hatchard
looked
dubious
and
in
a
thoughtful
fashion
walked
downstairs
and
let
himself
out
he
began
to
think
that
the
joke
was
of
a
more
complicated
nature
than
he
had
expected
and
it
was
not
without
forebodings
that
he
came
back
at
nine
that
night
accompanied
by
a
boy
with
his
baggage
his
gloom
disappeared
the
moment
the
door
opened
the
air
inside
was
warm
and
comfortable
and
pervaded
by
an
appetizing
smell
of
cooked
meats
upstairs
a
small
bright
fire
and
a
neatly
laid
awaited
his
arrival
he
sank
into
an
and
rubbed
his
hands
then
his
gaze
fell
on
a
small
bell
on
the
table
and
opening
the
door
he
rang
for
supper
sir
said
hatchard
entering
the
room
please
said
the
new
lodger
with
dignity
hatchard
looked
bewildered
there
it
is
she
said
indicating
the
table
do
want
me
to
feed
you
do
you
the
lodger
eyed
the
small
dry
piece
of
cheese
the
bread
and
butter
and
his
face
fell
thought
i
smelled
something
cooking
he
said
at
last
thought
i
smelled
something
cooking
he
said
that
was
my
supper
said
hatchard
with
a
smile
very
hungry
said
hatchard
trying
to
keep
his
temper
the
cold
weather
i
expect
said
hatchard
thoughtfully
does
affect
some
people
that
way
i
know
please
ring
if
you
want
she
left
the
room
humming
blithely
and
hatchard
after
sitting
for
some
time
in
silent
consternation
got
up
and
ate
his
frugal
meal
the
fact
that
the
held
three
pints
and
was
filled
to
the
brim
gave
him
no
satisfaction
he
was
still
hungry
when
he
arose
next
morning
and
with
curiosity
tempered
by
uneasiness
waited
for
his
breakfast
hatchard
came
in
at
last
and
after
polite
inquiries
as
to
how
he
had
slept
proceeded
to
lay
breakfast
a
fresh
loaf
and
a
large
teapot
appeared
and
the
smell
of
frizzling
bacon
ascended
from
below
then
hatchard
came
in
again
and
smiling
benevolently
placed
an
egg
before
him
and
withdrew
two
minutes
later
he
rang
the
bell
can
clear
away
he
said
as
hatchard
entered
the
room
no
breakfast
she
said
holding
up
her
hands
i
heard
of
you
single
young
men
but
i
never
tea
cold
and
as
black
as
ink
growled
the
indignant
lodger
the
egg
is
afraid
you
a
bit
of
a
said
hatchard
shaking
her
head
at
him
sure
i
try
my
best
to
please
i
do
mind
what
i
do
but
if
you
not
satisfied
you
better
here
began
her
husband
you
me
said
hatchard
quickly
idea
a
lodger
too
you
know
the
arrangement
you
better
go
i
think
if
you
ca
behave
wo
go
till
my
three
weeks
are
up
said
hatchard
doggedly
you
may
as
well
behave
ca
pamper
you
for
a
pound
a
week
said
hatchard
walking
to
the
door
you
want
pampering
you
had
better
a
week
passed
and
the
additional
expense
caused
by
getting
most
of
his
meals
out
began
to
affect
hatchard
health
his
wife
on
the
contrary
was
in
excellent
spirits
and
coming
in
one
day
explained
the
absence
of
the
by
stating
that
it
was
wanted
for
a
new
lodger
taken
my
other
two
rooms
she
said
little
back
parlor
and
the
front
full
up
he
like
my
table
too
inquired
hatchard
with
bitter
sarcasm
his
wife
said
that
she
would
inquire
and
brought
back
word
next
day
that
sadler
the
new
lodger
would
like
it
it
disappeared
during
hatchard
enforced
absence
at
business
and
a
small
bamboo
table
weak
in
the
joints
did
duty
in
its
stead
the
new
lodger
a
man
of
middle
age
with
a
ready
tongue
was
a
success
from
the
first
and
it
was
only
too
evident
that
hatchard
was
trying
her
best
to
please
him
hatchard
supping
on
bread
and
cheese
more
than
once
left
that
wholesome
meal
to
lean
over
the
balusters
and
smell
the
hot
meats
going
into
sadler
spoiling
him
he
said
to
hatchard
after
the
new
lodger
had
been
there
a
week
my
get
above
my
said
his
wife
briefly
come
to
me
if
youget
into
trouble
that
all
said
the
other
hatchard
laughed
derisively
do
like
him
that
what
it
is
she
remarked
asked
me
yesterday
whether
he
had
offended
you
in
any
he
did
did
he
snarled
hatchard
him
keep
himself
to
himself
and
mind
his
own
said
he
thinks
you
have
got
a
bad
temper
continued
his
wife
thinks
perhaps
it
indigestion
caused
by
eating
cheese
for
supper
hatchard
affected
not
to
hear
and
lighting
his
pipe
listened
fer
some
time
to
the
hum
of
conversation
between
his
wife
and
sadler
below
with
an
expression
of
resignation
on
his
face
that
was
almost
saintly
he
knocked
out
his
pipe
at
last
and
went
to
bed
half
an
hour
passed
and
he
was
still
awake
his
wife
voice
had
ceased
but
the
gruff
tones
of
sadler
were
still
audible
then
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
as
a
faint
cry
of
alarm
and
the
sound
of
somebody
rushing
upstairs
fell
on
his
ears
the
next
moment
the
door
of
his
room
burst
open
and
a
wild
figure
stumbling
in
the
darkness
rushed
over
to
the
bed
and
clasped
him
in
its
arms
gasped
his
wife
voice
alfred
alfred
said
hatchard
in
a
prim
voice
as
he
struggled
in
vain
to
free
himself
sobbed
hatchard
no
reason
for
coming
into
a
lodger
room
and
throwing
your
arms
round
his
neck
said
her
husband
severely
be
gasped
hatchard
sitting
downstairs
in
my
room
with
a
paper
cap
on
his
head
and
a
in
his
hand
and
says
he
emperor
of
who
inquired
her
husband
replied
hatchard
almost
strangling
him
made
me
kneel
in
front
o
him
and
keep
touching
the
floor
with
my
the
shook
in
sympathy
with
hatchard
husbandly
emotion
it
nothing
to
do
with
me
he
said
at
last
mad
said
his
wife
in
a
tense
whisper
staring
mad
he
says
i
his
favorite
wife
and
he
made
me
stroke
his
the
bed
shook
again
do
see
that

have
any
right
to
interfere
said
hatchard
after
he
had
quieted
the
bedstead
your
my
husband
said
hatchard
said
hatchard
remembered
that
have
you
alfred
said
his
wife
are
you
sorry
for
all
your
bad
behavior
demanded
hatchard
hatchard
hesitated
then
a
clatter
of
downstairs
moved
her
to
speech
she
sobbed
you
want
me
to
take
you
back
queried
the
generous
hatchard
said
his
wife
hatchard
got
out
of
bed
and
striking
a
match
lit
the
candle
and
taking
his
overcoat
from
a
peg
behind
the
door
put
it
on
and
marched
downstairs
hatchard
still
trembling
followed
behind
all
this
he
demanded
throwing
the
door
open
with
a
flourish
sadler
still
holding
the
and
still
with
the
paper
cap
on
his
head
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
then
as
he
saw
the
unkempt
figure
of
hatchard
with
the
scared
face
of
hatchard
peeping
over
his
shoulder
his
face
grew
red
his
eyes
watered
and
his
cheeks
swelled
he
said
explosively
english
not
chinese
said
hatchard
sternly
he
said
explosively
sadler
threw
down
the
and
to
hatchard
great
annoyance
clapped
his
open
hand
over
his
mouth
and
rocked
with
merriment
he
spluttered
do
said
hatchard
hastily
with
a
warning
frown
to
me
gurgled
sadler
ought
to
have
seen
it
alf
i
shall
never
get
over
good
at
me
i
ca
help
he
put
his
handkerchief
to
his
eyes
and
leaned
back
exhausted
when
he
removed
it
he
found
himself
alone
and
everything
still
but
for
a
murmur
of
voices
overhead
anon
steps
sounded
on
the
stairs
and
hatchard
grave
of
face
entered
the
room
he
said
briefly
said
the
astounded
sadler
it
eleven
ca
help
it
if
it
twelve
was
the
reply
play
the
fool
and
spoil
things
by
laughing
now
are
you
going
or
have
i
got
to
put
you
out
he
crossed
the
room
and
putting
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
protesting
sadler
pushed
him
into
the
passage
and
taking
his
coat
from
the
peg
held
it
up
for
him
sadler
abandoning
himself
to
his
fate
got
into
it
slowly
and
indulged
in
a
few
remarks
on
the
subject
of
ingratitude
ca
help
it
said
his
friend
in
a
low
voice
had
to
swear
i
never
seen
you
she
believe
you
said
the
staring
sadler
shivering
at
the
open
door
said
hatchard
slowly
she
pretends
the
sat
brooding
darkly
over
life
and
its
troubles
a
shooting
corn
on
the
little
toe
of
his
left
foot
and
a
touch
of
liver
due
he
was
convinced
to
the
unlawful
cellar
work
of
the
landlord
of
the
queen
head
had
induced
in
him
a
vein
of
profound
depression
a
discarded
boot
stood
by
his
side
and
his
foot
protruded
over
the
edge
of
the
jetty
until
a
passing
waterman
gave
it
a
playful
rap
with
his
oar
a
subsequent
inquiry
as
to
the
price
of
pigs
trotters
fell
on
ears
rendered
deaf
by
suffering
might
expected
it
said
the
watchman
at
last
done
that
you
can
call
him
a
kindness
once
and
this
is
my
reward
for
it
do
a
man
a
kindness
and
years

he
took
up
his
boot
and
inserting
his
foot
with
loving
care
stooped
down
and
fastened
the
laces
do
a
man
a
kindness
he
continued
assuming
a
safer
posture
and
tries
to
borrow
money
off
of
you
do
a
woman
a
kindness
and
she
thinks
you
want
to
marry
do
an
animal
a
kindness
and
it
tries
to
bite
as
a
horse
bit
a
sailorman
i
knew
once
when
sat
on
its
head
to
it
get
up
he
sat
too
far
pore
chap
kindness
never
gets
any
thanks
i
remember
a
man
whose
pal
broke
leg
while
they
was
working
together
unloading
a
barge
and
he
went
off
to
break
the
news
to
pal
wife
a
man
was
as
ever
you
see
and
knowing
she
would
take
on
when
she
the
news
he
told
her
fust
of
all
that
husband
was
killed
she
took
on
like
a
mad
thing
and
at
last
when
she
could
do
anything
more
and
quieted
down
a
bit
he
told
that
it
was
a
case
of
a
broken
leg
thinking
that
joy
would
be
so
great
that
she
would
think
anything
of
that
he
to
tell
her
three
times
afore
she
understood
and
then
instead
of
being
thankful
to
for
thoughtfulness
she
chased
him
over
wapping
with
a
chopper
screaming
with
temper
i
remember
ginger
dick
and
peter
russet
trying
to
do
old
sam
small
a
kindness
one
time
when
they
was

they
took
a
room
together
as

and
for
the
fust
two
or
three
days

was
like
brothers
that
could
last
o
course
and
sam
was
so
annoyed
one
evening
at
ginger
suspiciousness
by
biting
a
sam
owed
and
finding
it
was
a
bad
that
went
off
to
spend
the
evening
all
alone
by
himself
he
felt
a
bit
dull
at
fust
but
arter
he
had
two
or
three
began
to
take
a
brighter
view
of
things
he
found
a
very
nice
cosey
little
he
had
been
in
before
and
arter
getting
two
and
threepence
and
a
pint
for
the

ginger
on

began
to
think
that
the
world
was
as
bad
a
place
as

tried
to
make
out
there
was
one
other
man
in
the
little
bar

was
tall
dark
chap
with
black
and
spectacles
wot
kept
peeping
round
the
partition
and
looking
very
at
everybody
that
came
in
just
keeping
my
eye
on

in
a
whisper

in
the
winder
you
hook
on
over
your
ears

one
o
them

pull
our
caps
over
our
eyes
and
turn
our
collars
up
and
there
you
ginger
made
a
lot
of
objections
not
because
he
did
think
it
was
a
good
idea
but
because
he
did
like
peter
thinking
of
it
instead
of
but
he
gave
way
at
last
and
arter
he
got
the
beard
he
stood
for
a
long
time
in
front
o
the
glass
thinking
wot
a
difference
it
would
ha
made
to
his
looks
if
he
had
black
instead
o
red
waiting
for
the
evening
made
the
day
seem
very
long
to
but
it
came
at
last
and
with
the
beards
in
their
pockets
they
slipped
out
and
went
for
a
walk
round
they
a
pint
each
at
a
at
the
top
of
the
minories
just
to
steady
themselves
and
then
they
came
out
and
hooked
on
their
beards
and
wot
with
them
and
pulling
their
caps
down
and
turning
their
up
there
was
much
of
their
faces
to
be
seen
by
anybody
it
was
just
five
minutes
to
nine
when
they
got
to
tower
hill
and
they
walked
down
the
middle
of
the
road
keeping
a
bright
lookout
for
old
sam
a
little
way
down
they
saw
a
couple
o
chaps
leaning
up
agin
a
closed
gate
in
the
dock
wall
lighting
their
pipes
and
peter
and
ginger
both
nudged
each
other
with
their
elbows
at
the
same
time
they
just
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
when
sam
turned
the
corner
peter
would
believe
at
fust
that
the
old
man
was
really
the
worse
for
liquor
was
so
lifelike
many
a
drunken
man
would
ha
been
proud
to
ha
done
it
so
well
and
it
made
pleased
to
think
that
sam
was
a
pal
of
him
and
ginger
turned
and
crept
up
behind
the
old
man
on
tiptoe
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
tilted
sam
cap
over
eyes
and
flung
his
arms
round
while
ginger
felt
in
and
took
out
a
leather
purse
chock
full
o
money
it
was
all
done
and
over
in
a
moment
and
then
to
ginger
great
surprise
sam
suddenly
lifted
foot
and
gave
a
fearful
kick
on
the
shin
of
leg
and
at
the
same
time
let
drive
with
all
his
might
in
face
ginger
went
down
as
if
he
been
shot
and
as
peter
went
to
him
up
he
got
a
bang
over
the
that
put
alongside
ginger
arter
which
sam
turned
and
trotted
off
down
the
hill
like
a
drive
with
all
his
might
in
for
a
minute
ginger
did
know
where
was
and
afore
he
found
out
the
two
men
they
seen
in
the
gateway
came
up
and
one
of
put
his
knee
in
ginger
back
and
him
while
the
other
caught
hold
of
his
and
dragged
the
purse
out
of
it
arter
which
they
both
made
off
up
the
hill
as
as
they
could
go
while
peter
russet
in
a
faint
voice
called
arter
them
he
got
up
presently
and
helped
ginger
up
and
they
both
stood
there
pitying
themselves
and
each
other
to
think
of
names
to
call
sam
the
money
gorn
and
it
own
silly
fault
ses
ginger
wotever
he
must
know
that
we
had
a
in
it
mind

starve
for
all

a
single

i

little
drop

too
but
though
they
went
into
the
private
bar
it
private
enough
for
them
and
when
the
landlady
asked
ginger
who
been
kissing
he
put
glass
down
with
a
bang
and
walked
straight
off
sam
turned
up
by
the
time
they
got
there
and
pore
ginger
took
advantage
of
it
to
put
a
little
warm
on
bad
leg
then
he
bathed
face
very
careful
and
peter
bathe
his
they
just
finished
when
they
heard
sam
coming
upstairs
and
ginger
sat
down
on
bed
and
began
to
whistle
while

took
up

deferred
elderly

with
a
wooden
leg
who
joined
the
indignant
officer
in
the
pursuit
fortunately
for
captain
bligh
there
were
but
few
people
about
and
the
only
person
who
saw
him
trip
pilbeam
was
an
elderly
man
with
a
wooden
leg
who
joined
the
indignant
officer
in
the
pursuit
the
captain
had
youth
on
his
side
and
diving
into
the
narrow
that
constitute
the
older
portion
of
woodhatch
he
moderated
his
pace
and
listened
acutely
the
sounds
of
pursuit
died
away
in
the
distance
and
he
had
already
dropped
into
a
walk
when
the
hurried
tap
of
the
wooden
leg
sounded
from
one
corner
and
a
chorus
of
hurried
voices
from
the
other
it
was
clear
that
the
number
of
hunters
had
increased
he
paused
a
second
irresolute
the
next
he
pushed
open
a
door
that
stood
ajar
in
an
old
flint
wall
and
peeped
in
he
saw
a
small
yard
in
which
trim
myrtles
and
flowering
plants
stood
about
in
freshly
ochred
pots
and
opening
the
door
a
little
wider
he
slipped
in
and
closed
it
behind
him
said
a
voice
sharply
do
you
want
captain
bligh
turned
and
saw
a
girl
standing
in
a
hostile
attitude
in
the
doorway
of
the
house
he
said
holding
up
his
finger
the
girl
cheeks
flushed
and
her
eyes
sparkled
are
you
doing
in
our
yard
she
demanded
the
captain
face
relaxed
as
the
sound
of
voices
died
away
he
gave
his
moustache
a
twist
and
eyed
her
with
frank
admiration
he
said
briefly
nearly
had
me
had
no
business
to
escape
into
our
yard
said
the
girl
have
you
been
escaping
from
policeman
said
the
skipper
jauntily
twisting
his
moustache
miss
pilbeam
only
daughter
of
sergeant
pilbeam
caught
her
breath
sharply
have
you
been
doing
she
inquired
as
soon
as
she
could
control
her
voice
said
the
skipper
airily
i
was
kicking
a
stone
along
the
path
and
he
told
me
to
stop
said
miss
pilbeam
impatiently
had
words
said
the
skipper
do
like
while
we
were
talking
he
happened
to
lose
his
balance
and
go
over
into
some
mud
that
was
swept
up
at
the
side
of
the
his
balance
gasped
the
horrified
miss
pilbeam
the
skipper
was
flattered
at
her
concern
would
have
laughed
if
you
had
seen
him
he
said
smiling
look
so
frightened
he
got
me
said
the
girl
slowly
she
gazed
at
him
with
such
a
world
of
longing
in
her
eyes
that
the
skipper
despite
a
somewhat
large
share
of
was
almost
startled
he
sha
have
me
he
said
returning
her
gaze
with
interest
miss
pilbeam
stood
in
silent
thought
she
was
a
strong
girl
but
she
realized
fully
that
she
was
no
match
for
the
villain
who
stood
before
her
twisting
his
moustache
and
adjusting
his
and
her
father
would
not
be
off
duty
until
nine
suppose
you
would
like
to
wait
here
until
it
is
dark
she
said
at
last
would
sooner
wait
here
than
anywhere
said
the
skipper
with
respectful
ardor
you
would
like
to
come
in
and
sit
down
said
the
girl
captain
bligh
thanked
her
and
removing
his
cap
followed
her
into
a
small
parlor
in
the
front
of
the
house
is
out
she
said
as
she
motioned
him
to
an
i
sure
he
be
pleased
to
see
you
when
he
comes
i
shall
be
pleased
to
see
him
said
the
innocent
skipper
miss
pilbeam
kept
her
doubts
to
herself
and
sat
in
a
brown
study
wondering
how
the
capture
was
to
be
effected
she
had
a
strong
presentiment
that
the
appearance
of
her
father
at
the
front
door
would
be
the
signal
for
her
visitor
departure
at
the
back
for
a
time
there
was
an
awkward
silence
thing
for
me
i
upset
that
policeman
said
the
skipper
at
last
inquired
the
girl
i
should
have
come
into
your
yard
was
the
reply
the
first
time
we
have
ever
put
into
woodhatch
and
i
might
have
sailed
away
and
never
seen
you
where
should
we
have
been
but
for
that
fat
policeman
miss
soon
as
she
could
get
her
where
indeed
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
began
to
feel
the
need
of
a
chaperon
to
think
of
him
hunting
for
me
high
and
low
while
i
am
sitting
here
said
the
skipper
miss
pilbeam
agreed
with
him
and
began
to
laugh
so
heartily
that
he
was
fain
at
last
to
draw
his
chair
close
to
hers
and
pat
her
somewhat
anxiously
on
the
back
the
treatment
sobered
her
at
once
and
she
drew
apart
and
eyed
him
coldly
was
afraid
you
would
lose
your
breath
explained
the
skipper
awkwardly
are
not
angry
are
you
he
was
so
genuinely
relieved
when
she
said
that
miss
pilbeam
despite
her
father
wrongs
began
to
soften
a
little
the
upsetter
of
policemen
was
certainly
and
his
manner
towards
her
so
nicely
balanced
between
boldness
and
timidity
that
a
slight
feeling
of
sadness
at
his
lack
of
moral
character
began
to
assail
her
you
are
caught
after
all
she
said
presently
will
go
to
the
skipper
shrugged
his
shoulders
do
suppose
i
shall
be
he
replied
you
sorry
persisted
miss
pilbeam
in
a
vibrant
voice
not
said
the
skipper
i
should
have
seen
you
if
i
had
done
miss
pilbeam
looked
at
the
clock
and
pondered
it
wanted
but
five
minutes
to
nine
five
minutes
in
which
to
make
up
a
mind
that
was
in
a
state
of
strong
unrest
suppose
it
is
time
for
me
to
go
said
the
skipper
watching
her
miss
pilbeam
rose
do
go
she
said
hastily
be
quiet
i
want
to
captain
bligh
waited
in
respectful
silence
heedless
of
the
fateful
seconds
ticking
from
the
mantelpiece
at
the
sound
of
a
slow
measured
footfall
on
the
cobblestone
path
outside
miss
pilbeam
caught
his
arm
and
drew
him
towards
the
door
she
breathed
stop
she
stood
trying
in
vain
to
make
up
her
mind
she
said
and
leading
the
way
entered
her
father
bedroom
and
after
a
moment
thought
opened
the
door
of
a
cupboard
in
the
corner
in
there
she
whispered
objected
the
astonished
bligh
the
front
door
was
heard
to
open
said
miss
pilbeam
in
a
thrilling
whisper
the
skipper
stepped
into
the
cupboard
without
further
parley
and
the
girl
turning
the
key
slipped
it
into
her
pocket
and
sped
downstairs
sergeant
pilbeam
was
in
the
with
his
belt
unfastened
when
she
entered
the
parlor
and
with
a
hungry
reference
to
supper
sat
watching
her
as
she
lit
the
lamp
and
drew
down
the
blind
with
a
lifelong
knowledge
of
the
requirements
of
the
force
she
drew
a
jug
of
beer
and
placed
it
by
his
side
while
she
set
the
table
i
wanted
that
said
the
sergeant
been
miss
pilbeam
raised
her
eyebrows
some
chap
that
capsized
me
when
i
was
prepared
for
it
said
her
father
putting
down
his
glass
was
a
neat
bit
work
and
i
shall
tell
him
so
when
i
catch
him
look
here
he
stood
up
and
exhibited
the
damage
rubbed
off
what
i
could
he
said
resuming
his
seat
i
the
rest
brush
off
when
it
dry
morning
i
shall
go
down
to
the
harbor
and
try
and
spot
my
he
drew
his
chair
to
the
table
and
helped
himself
and
filling
his
mouth
with
cold
meat
and
pickles
enlarged
on
his
plans
for
the
capture
of
his
assailant
plans
to
which
the
undecided
miss
pilbeam
turned
a
somewhat
abstracted
ear
by
the
time
her
father
had
finished
his
supper
she
was
trying
but
in
vain
to
devise
means
for
the
prisoner
escape
the
sergeant
had
opened
the
door
of
the
room
for
the
sake
of
fresh
air
and
it
was
impossible
for
anybody
to
come
downstairs
without
being
seen
the
story
of
a
sickly
geranium
in
the
left
him
unmoved
would
get
up
for
all
the
geraniums
in
the
world
he
declared
just
going
to
have
one
more
pipe
and
then
i
off
to
bed
running
do
agree
with
he
went
despite
his
daughter
utmost
efforts
to
prevent
him
and
she
sat
in
silent
consternation
listening
to
his
heavy
tread
overhead
she
heard
the
bed
creak
in
noisy
protest
as
he
climbed
in
and
ten
minutes
later
the
lusty
snoring
of
a
healthy
man
of
full
habit
resounded
through
the
house
she
went
to
bed
herself
at
last
and
after
lying
awake
for
nearly
a
couple
of
hours
closed
her
eyes
in
order
to
think
better
she
awoke
with
the
sun
pouring
in
at
the
window
and
the
sounds
of
vigorous
brushing
in
the
yard
beneath
nearly
got
it
off
said
the
sergeant
looking
up
destroying
evidence
in
a
sense
i
suppose
but
i
ca
go
about
with
my
uniform
plastered
with
mud
i
had
enough
chaff
about
it
as
it
miss
pilbeam
stole
to
the
door
of
the
next
room
and
peeped
stealthily
in
not
a
sound
came
from
the
cupboard
and
a
horrible
idea
that
the
prisoner
might
have
been
suffocated
set
her
trembling
with
apprehension
she
whispered
an
eager
but
stifled
came
from
the
and
miss
pilbeam
her
fears
allayed
stepped
softly
into
the
room
downstairs
brushing
the
mud
off
she
said
in
a
low
voice
is
said
the
skipper
fat
policeman
said
the
girl
in
a
hard
voice
as
she
remembered
her
father
wrongs
he
doing
it
here
for
demanded
the
astonished
skipper
he
lives
queried
the
skipper
more
astonished
than
before
said
miss
pilbeam
a
horrified
groan
from
the
cupboard
fell
like
music
on
her
ears
then
the
smile
forsook
her
lips
and
she
stood
quivering
with
indignation
as
the
groan
gave
way
to
suppressed
but
unmistakable
laughter
she
said
sharply
and
with
head
erect
sailed
out
of
the
room
and
went
downstairs
to
give
pilbeam
his
breakfast
to
the
skipper
in
the
confined
space
and
darkness
of
the
cupboard
the
breakfast
seemed
unending
the
sergeant
evidently
believed
in
sitting
over
his
meals
and
his
deep
rumbling
voice
punctuated
by
laughter
was
plainly
audible
to
pass
the
time
the
skipper
fell
to
counting
and
tired
of
that
recited
some
verses
that
he
had
acquired
at
school
after
that
and
with
far
more
heartiness
he
declaimed
a
few
things
that
he
had
learned
since
and
still
the
clatter
and
rumble
sounded
from
below
it
was
a
relief
to
him
when
he
heard
the
sergeant
push
his
chair
back
and
move
heavily
about
the
room
a
minute
later
he
heard
him
ascending
the
stairs
and
then
he
held
his
breath
with
horror
as
the
entered
the
room
and
a
heavy
hand
was
laid
on
the
cupboard
door
bawled
the
sergeant
the
key
of
my
cupboard
i
want
my
other
down
here
cried
the
voice
of
miss
pilbeam
and
the
skipper
hardly
able
to
believe
in
his
good
fortune
heard
the
sergeant
go
downstairs
again
at
the
expiration
of
another
his
own
heard
the
light
hurried
footsteps
of
miss
pilbeam
come
up
the
stairs
and
pause
at
the
door
he
said
recklessly
coming
said
the
girl
be
a
key
turned
in
the
lock
the
door
was
flung
open
and
the
skipper
dazed
and
blinking
with
the
sudden
light
stumbled
into
the
room
gone
said
miss
pilbeam
the
skipper
made
no
answer
he
was
administering
first
aid
to
a
right
leg
which
had
temporarily
forgotten
how
to
perform
its
duties
varied
with
slaps
and
pinches
at
a
left
which
had
gone
to
sleep
at
intervals
he
turned
a
and
reproachful
eye
on
miss
pilbeam
was
administering
first
aid
to
a
right
leg
want
a
wash
and
some
breakfast
she
said
softly
a
wash
there
water
and
a
towel
and
while
you
making
yourself
tidy
i
be
getting
the
skipper
hobbled
to
the
and
dipping
his
head
in
a
basin
of
cool
water
began
to
feel
himself
again
by
the
time
he
had
done
his
hair
in
the
sergeant
glass
and
twisted
his
moustache
into
shape
he
felt
better
still
and
he
went
downstairs
almost
blithely
very
sorry
it
was
your
father
he
said
as
he
took
a
seat
at
the
table
why
you
laughed
i
suppose
said
the
girl
tossing
her
head
i
had
the
worst
of
it
said
the
other
sooner
be
upset
a
hundred
times
than
spend
a
night
in
that
cupboard
however
all
well
that
ends
said
miss
pilbeam
dolefully
is
it
the
end
captain
bligh
put
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
eyed
her
uneasily
do
you
mean
he
said
mind
do
spoil
your
breakfast
said
the
girl
tell
you
afterwards
it
horrid
to
think
after
all
my
trouble
of
your
doing
two
months
as
well
as
a
night
in
the
said
the
unfortunate
eying
her
in
great
concern
the
matter
ca
think
of
everything
said
miss
pilbeam
of
course
we
ought
to
have
thought
of
the
mate
getting
uneasy
when
you
did
turn
up
last
night
and
going
to
the
with
a
description
of
the
skipper
started
and
smote
the
table
with
his
fist
gone
down
to
watch
the
ship
now
said
miss
pilbeam
course
it
the
exact
description
of
the
man
that
assaulted
him
providential
he
called
the
worst
of
having
a
fool
for
a
mate
said
the
skipper
bitterly
business
was
it
of
his
i
should
like
to
know
it
got
to
do
with
him
whether
i
turn
up
or
not
what
does
he
want
to
interfere
for
no
good
blaming
him
said
miss
pilbeam
thinking
deeply
with
her
chin
on
her
finger
thing
is
what
is
to
be
done
once
father
gets
his
hand
on
she
shuddered
so
did
the
skipper
might
get
off
with
a
fine
i
did
hurt
him
he
remarked
miss
pilbeam
shook
her
head
very
strict
in
woodhatch
she
said
was
a
fool
to
touch
him
at
all
said
the
repentant
skipper
spirits
that
what
it
was
high
spirits
and
being
spoken
to
as
if
i
was
a
thing
is
how
are
you
to
escape
said
the
girl
no
good
going
out
of
doors
with
the
police
and
half
the
people
in
woodhatch
all
on
the
for
i
could
only
get
aboard
i
should
be
all
right
muttered
the
skipper
could
keep
down
the
while
the
mate
took
the
ship
miss
pilbeam
sat
in
deep
thought
the

good
disguise

to
pass

father
i
can
tell
captain
bligh
gave
a
gloomy
assent
only
thing
for
you
to
do
so
far
as
i
can
see
said
the
girl
slowly
to
make
yourself
up
like
a
coalie
there
are
one
or
two
colliers
in
the
harbor
and
if
you
took
off
your
could
send
it
on
yourself
all
over
with
and
shaved
off
your
moustache

believe
you
would
ejaculated
the
skipper
in
choking
accents
your
only
chance
said
miss
pilbeam
captain
bligh
leaned
back
frowning
and
from
sheer
force
of
habit
passed
the
ends
of
his
moustache
slowly
through
his
fingers
think
the
would
be
enough
he
said
at
last
the
girl
shook
her
head
particularly
noticed
your
moustache
she
said

the
skipper
with
mournful
pride
wo
part
with

my
sake
inquired
miss
pilbeam
eying
him
mournfully
after
all
i
done
for
you
said
the
other
stoutly
miss
pilbeam
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
with
a
suspicious
little
sniff
hurried
from
the
room
captain
bligh
much
affected
waited
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
went
in
pursuit
of
her
fifteen
minutes
later
shorn
of
his
moustache
he
stood
in
the
sulkily
smearing
himself
with
coal

the
girl

up
a

and
ordering

with
hearty
good
half
doing
it
she
declared
go
and
look
at
yourself
in
the
glass
in
the
the
skipper
went
and
came
back
in
a
state
of
misery
even
miss
pilbeam
statement
that
his
own
mother
would
not
know
him
failed
to
lift
the
cloud
from
his
brow
he
stood
disconsolate
as
the
girl
opened
the
front
door
she
said
gently
and
tell
me
when
you
are
captain
bligh
promised
and
walked
slowly
up
the
road
so
far
from
people
attempting
to
arrest
him
they
vied
with
each
other
in
giving
him
he
reached
the
harbor
unmolested
and
lurking
at
a
convenient
corner
made
a
careful
survey
a
couple
of
craft
were
working
out
their
coal
a
small
steamer
was
just
casting
loose
and
a
gliding
slowly
over
the
still
water
to
its
berth
his
own
schooner
which
lay
near
the
colliers
had
apparently
knocked
off
work
pending
his
arrival
for
sergeant
pilbeam
he
looked
in
vain
he
waited
a
minute
or
two
and
then
with
a
furtive
glance
right
and
left
strolled
in
a
careless
fashion
until
he
was
abreast
of
one
of
the
colliers
nobody
took
any
notice
of
him
and
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
gazed
meditatively
into
the
water
and
edged
along
towards
his
own
craft
his
foot
trembled
as
he
placed
it
on
the
plank
that
formed
the
gangway
but
resisting
the
temptation
to
look
behind
he
gained
the
deck
and
walked
forward
what
do
you
want
inquired
a
coming
out
of
the
galley
right
bill
said
the
skipper
in
a
low
voice
take
any
notice
of
said
the
seaman
starting
lor
what
ha
up
said
the
skipper
fiercely
and
walking
to
the
forecastle
placed
his
hand
on
the
scuttle
and
descended
with
studied
slowness
as
he
reached
the
floor
the
perturbed
face
of
bill
blocked
the
opening
an
accident
he
inquired
respectfully
snapped
the
skipper
down
do
stand
up
there
attracting
attention
do
you
want
the
whole
town
round
you
come
down
all
right
where
i
am
said
bill
backing
hastily
as
the
skipper
putting
a
foot
on
the
ladder
thrust
a
black
and
furious
face
close
to
his
out
then
hissed
the
skipper
and
send
the
mate
to
me
do
hurry
and
if
anybody
noticed
me
come
aboard
and
should
ask
you
who
i
am
say
i
a
pal
of
the
seaman
marvelling
greatly
withdrew
and
the
skipper
throwing
himself
on
a
locker
wiped
a
bit
of
grit
out
of
his
eye
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
the
mate
he
was
so
long
in
coming
that
he
waxed
impatient
and
ascending
a
step
of
the
ladder
again
peeped
on
to
the
deck
the
first
object
that
met
his
gaze
was
the
figure
of
the
mate
leaning
against
the
side
of
the
ship
with
a
wary
eye
on
the
scuttle
here
said
the
skipper
wrong
inquired
the
mate
retreating
a
couple
of
paces
in
disorder
repeated
the
skipper
the
mate
advanced
slowly
and
in
response
to
an
imperative
command
from
the
skipper
slowly
descended
and
stood
regarding
him
nervously
you
may
look
said
the
skipper
with
sudden
ferocity
is
all
your
doing
where
are
you
going
he
caught
the
mate
by
the
coat
as
he
was
making
for
the
ladder
and
hauled
him
back
again
go
when
i
finished
with
you
he
said
grimly
what
do
you
mean
by
it
eh
what
do
you
mean
by
it
all
right
said
the
mate
in
a
soothing
voice
get
at
me
said
the
skipper
through
your
interfering
how
dare
you
go
making
inquiries
about
me
said
the
mate
backing
as
far
as
possible
it
got
to
do
with
you
if
i
stay
out
all
night
pursued
the
skipper
said
the
other
feebly
did
you
go
to
the
police
about
me
for
then
demanded
the
skipper
said
the
mate
in
the
shrill
accents
of
astonishment
i
did
go
to
no
police
about
you
why
should
i
you
mean
to
say
you
did
report
my
absence
last
night
to
the
police
said
the
skipper
sternly
not
said
the
mate
plucking
up
courage
should
i
if
you
like
to
take
a
night
off
it
nothing
to
do
with
me
i
i
know
my
duty
better
i
do
know
what
you
talking
the
police
have
been
watching
the
ship
and
inquiring
for
me
asked
the
skipper
the
mate
shook
his
bewildered
head
should
they
he
inquired
the
skipper
made
no
reply
he
sat
staring
straight
before
him
trying
in
vain
to
realize
the
hardness
of
the
heart
that
had
been
responsible
for
such
a
scurvy
trick
it
ai
the
fust
time
you
been
out
all
night
remarked
the
mate
aggressively
the
skipper
favored
him
with
a
glance
the
dignity
of
which
was
somewhat
impaired
by
his
complexion
and
in
a
slow
and
stately
fashion
ascended
to
the
deck
then
he
caught
his
breath
sharply
and
paled
beneath
the
coaldust
as
he
saw
sergeant
pilbeam
standing
on
the
quay
opposite
the
ship
by
his
side
stood
miss
pilbeam
and
both
with
a
look
in
their
eyes
were
smiling
vaguely
but
contentedly
at
the
horizon
the
sergeant
appeared
to
be
the
first
to
see
the
skipper
darkie
he
cried
captain
bligh
who
was
creeping
slowly
aft
halted
and
clenching
his
fists
regarded
him
ferociously
this
to
the
skipper
will
you
my
lad
said
the
sergeant
holding
up
the
jacket
bligh
had
left
behind
young
man
with
a
very
fine
moustache
he
this
to
the
skipper
will

lad
said
the
sergeant
said
his
daughter
in
a
mournful
voice

rather
dark
complexion
continued
the
sergeant
grinning
madly

going
to
take
stealing
my
i
thought
better
of
it
thought
of
a
better
way
at
least
my
daughter
did
so
long
he
kissed
the
top
of
a
fat
middle
finger
and
turning
away
walked
off
with
miss
pilbeam
the
skipper
stood
watching
them
with
his
head
swimming
until
arrived
at
the
corner
they
stopped
and
the
sergeant
came
slowly
back
was
nearly
forgetting
he
said
slowly
your
skipper
that
if
so
be
as
he
wants
to
stealing
my
shall
be
at
home
at
tea
at
five
he
jerked
his
thumb
in
the
direction
of
miss
pilbeam
and
winked

slow
deliberation
be
there
too
he
added
dowson

by
the
kitchen

smoking
and
turning
a
docile
and
ear
to

heated
words

herself
by
an
effort

cover

the
smoke

bestowed
a
sympathetic
wink
upon
his
daughter

inquired
the
sentimental
dowson
neither
lady
took
the
slightest
notice

larky
said
dowson
solemnly
easy

and
easy
go
with
he
just
such
another
as
your
father
cousin
look
what
to
him
miss
dowson
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
subsiding
in
her
chair
went
on
with
her
book
until
a
loud
knock
at
the
door
and
a
cheerful
but
peculiarly
shrill
whistle
sounded
outside
dowson
subsiding
in
her
chair
went
on
with
her
book
is
my
lord
exclaimed
dowson
waspishly
might
think
the

to
him
and
now
he
dancing
on
my
clean
be
only
knocking
the
mud
off
afore
coming
in
said
dowson
as
he
rose
to
open
the
door
noticed
he
very
just
came
in
to
tell
you
a
joke
said
foss
as
he
followed
his
host
into
the
kitchen
and
gazed
tenderly
at
miss
joke
i
ever
had
in
my
life
i
my
fortune
what
it
was
been
laughing
to
myself
ever
told
it
inquired
dowson
after
a
somewhat
awkward
silence
gypsy
woman
in
peter
street
replied
foss
gave
a
wrong
name
and
address
just
in
case
she
might
ha
heard
about
me
and
she
did
make
a
mess
of
it
upon
my
word
she
did
she
say
inquired
dowson
foss
laughed
i
was
a
wrong
he
said
cheerfully
would
bring
my
mother
gray
hairs
to
the
grave
with
sorrow
i
to
bad
companions
and
take
to
drink
i
to
steal
money
to
gamble
with
and
after
all
that
i
to
five
years
for
bigamy
i
told
her
i
was
disappointed
i
was
to
be
hung
and
she
said
it
would
be
a
disappointment
to
a
lot
of
other
people
too
laugh
i
thought
i
should
killed
do
see
nothing
to
laugh
at
said
dowson
coldly
should
tell
anybody
else
charlie
said
her
husband
it
a
secret
my
do
believe
it
stammered
the
crestfallen
foss
dowson
cast
a
stealthy
glance
at
her
daughter
wonderful
some
o
those
can
see
into
the
future
she
said
shaking
her
head
said
her
husband
with
a
confirmatory
nod
is
no
name
for
it
i
my
fortune
told
once
when
i
was
a
boy
and
she
told
me
i
should
marry
the
prettiest
and
the
nicest
and
the
gal
in
foss
with
a
triumphant
smile
barely
waited
for
him
to
finish
he
began
and
stopped
suddenly
just
came
in
to
tell
you
a
joke
was
you
about
to
remark
inquired
dowson
icily
was
going
to
say
replied
was
going
to
just
got
it
on
the
tip
o
my
tongue
to
say
all
the
luck
mr
dowson
he
edged
his
chair
a
little
nearer
to
flora
but
there
was
a
chilliness
in
the
atmosphere
against
which
his
high
spirits
strove
in
vain
dowson
remembered
other
predictions
which
had
come
true
notably
the
case
of
one
man
who
learning
that
he
was
to
come
in
for
a
legacy
gave
up
a
job
and
did
actually
come
in
for
twenty
pounds
and
a
seven
years
afterwards
edged
his
chair
a
little
nearer
to
flora
all
nonsense
protested
foss
only
said
all
that
because
i
made
fun
of
her
you
do
believe
it
do
you
flora
do
see
anything
to
laugh
at
returned
miss
dowson
five
years
for
bigamy
fancy
the
disgrace
of
it
you
talking
as
if
i
was
going
to
do
it
objected
foss
wish
you
go
and
your
fortune
told
go
and
see
what
she
says
about
you
you
wo
believe
so
much
in
dowson
looked
up
quickly
and
then
lowering
her
eyes
took
her
hand
out
of
the
stocking
she
had
been
darning
and
placing
it
beside
its
companion
rolled
the
pair
into
a
ball
go
round
night
flora
she
said
deliberately
be
said
a
daughter
of
mine
was
afraid
to
hear
the
truth
about
herself
father
find
the
she
can
say
what
she
likes
about
you
but
i
believe
it
said
foss
reproachfully
do
suppose
it
be
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
said
miss
dowson
sharply
foss
bade
them
suddenly
and
finding
himself
accompanied
to
the
door
by
dowson
gave
way
to
gloom
he
stood
for
so
long
with
one
foot
on
the
step
and
the
other
on
the
mat
that
dowson
who
disliked
draughts
got
impatient
foss
bade
them
suddenly
catch
cold
charlie
he
said
at
last
what
i
trying
to
do
said
foss
death
o
cold
then
i
get
five
years
for
bigamy
he
added
bitterly
up
said
dowson
years
ai
much
out
of
a
lifetime
and
you
ca
expect
to
your
fun
he
watched
the
retreating
figure
of
foss
as
it
stamped
its
way
down
the
street
and
closing
the
door
returned
to
the
kitchen
to
discuss
palmistry
and
other
sciences
until
bedtime
dowson
saw
husband
and
daughter
off
to
work
in
the
morning
and
after
washing
up
the
breakfast
things
drew
her
chair
up
to
the
kitchen
fire
and
became
absorbed
in
memories
of
the
past
all
the
leading
incidents
in
flora
career
passed
in
review
before
her
measles
and
other
things
peculiar
to
the
age
of
innocence
were
all
there
in
her
enthusiasm
she
nearly
gave
her
a
sprained
ankle
which
had
belonged
to
her
sister
still
shaking
her
head
over
her
mistake
she
drew
flora
latest
portrait
carefully
from
its
place
in
the
album
and
putting
on
her
hat
and
jacket
went
round
to
make
a
call
in
peter
street
by
the
time
flora
returned
home
dowson
appeared
to
have
forgotten
the
arrangement
made
the
night
before
and
being
reminded
by
her
daughter
questioned
whether
any
good
could
come
of
attempts
to
peer
into
the
future
dowson
was
still
more
emphatic
but
his
objections
being
recognized
by
both
ladies
as
ones
carried
no
weight
it
ended
in
flora
going
off
with
half
a
crown
in
her
glove
and
an
urgent
request
from
her
father
to
make
it
as
difficult
as
possible
for
the
sibyl
by
giving
a
false
name
and
address
no
name
was
asked
for
however
as
miss
dowson
was
shown
into
the
untidy
little
back
room
on
the
first
floor
in
which
the
sorceress
ate
slept
and
received
visitors
she
rose
from
an
old
as
the
visitor
entered
and
regarding
her
with
a
pair
of
beady
black
eyes
bade
her
sit
down
you
the
inquired
the
girl
call
me
so
was
the
reply
but
are
you
persisted
miss
dowson
who
inherited
her
fondness
for
half
crowns
said
the
other
in
a
more
natural
voice
she
took
the
girl
left
hand

said
in
a
deep
voice

muttered
some
strange
words

long
recital

to

the
soothsayer
dropping
her
hand
for
the

took
the
girl

hand
and
poured
some
of
the
liquid
into
it

what
to

and
what
to

she
bent
over
the
girl
hand
again
and
uttered
little
ejaculations
of
surprise
and
perplexity
see
you
moving
in
gay
scenes
surrounded
by
happy
faces
she
said
slowly
are
much
sought
after
handsome
presents
and
fine
clothes

showered
upon
you

will
cross
the
sea
i
see
a
dark
young
man
and
a
fair
young
man
they
will
both
influence
your
life
the
fair
young
man
works
in
his
father
shop
he
will
have
great
about
the
other
inquired
miss
dowson
after
a
somewhat
lengthy
pause
the
shook
her
head
is
his
own
worst
enemy
she
said
he
will
drag
down
those
he
loves
with
him
you
are
going
to
marry
one
of
them
but
i
ca
see
ca
see
again
said
the
trembling
flora
ca
see
was
the
reply
it
is
meant
for
me
to
see
it
for
you
to
choose
i
can
see
them
now
as
plain
as
i
can
see
you
you
are
all
three
standing
where
two
roads
meet
the
fair
young
man
is
beckoning
to
you
and
pointing
to
a
big
house
and
a
and
a
the
other
said
the
surprised
miss
dowson
in
knickerbockers
said
the
other
doubtfully
does
that
mean
ah
i
see
they
got
the
broad
arrow
on
them
and
he
is
pointing
to
a
jail
it
all
can
see
no
she
dropped
the
girl
hand
and
drawing
her
hand
across
her
eyes
sank
back
into
her
chair
miss
dowson
with
trembling
fingers
dropped
the
half
crown
into
her
lap
and
with
her
head
in
a
whirl
made
her
way
downstairs
after
such
marvels
the
streets
seemed
oddly
commonplace
as
she
walked
swiftly
home
she
decided
as
she
went
to
keep
her
knowledge
to
herself
but
inclination
on
the
one
hand
and
dowson
on
the
other
got
the
better
of
her
resolution
with
the
exception
of
a
few
things
in
her
past
already
known
and
therefore
not
worth
dwelling
upon
the
whole
of
the
interview
was
disclosed
fair
takes
your
breath
away
declared
the
astounded
dowson
fair
young
man
is
meant
for
ben
lippet
said
his
wife
the
dark
one
is
charlie
foss
it
must
be
it
no
use
shutting
your
eyes
to
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
agreed
her
husband
she
told
charlie
five
years
for
bigamy
and
when
she
telling
flora
fortune
she
sees
in
convict
clothes
how
she
does
it
i
ca
a
gift
said
dowson
briefly
i
do
hope
that
flora
is
going
to
act
sensible
anyhow
she
can
let
ben
lippet
come
and
see
her
without
going
upstairs
with
the
can
come
if
he
likes
said
flora
why
charlie
could
have
the
and
the
five
years
i
do
lippet
came
in
the
next
evening
and
the
evening
after
in
fact
so
easy
is
it
to
fall
into
habits
of
an
agreeable
nature
that
nearly
every
evening
saw
him
the
happy
guest
of
dowson
a
spirit
of
resignation
fostered
by
a
present
or
two
and
a
visit
to
the
theatre
descended
upon
miss
dowson
fate
and
her
mother
combined
were
in
a
fair
way
to
overcome
her
inclinations
when
foss
who
had
been
out
of
town
on
a
job
came
in
to
hear
the
result
of
her
visit
to
the
and
found
lippet
installed
in
the
seat
that
used
to
be
his
at
first
dowson
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
his
request
for
information
and
it
was
only
when
his
jocularity
on
the
subject
passed
the
bounds
of
endurance
that
she
consented
to
gratify
his
curiosity
did
want
to
tell
you
she
said
when
she
had
finished
you
asked
for
it
and
now
you
got
very
amusing
said
foss
wonder
who
the
dark
young
man
in
the
fancy
knickers
is
i
daresay
you
know
some
day
said
dowson
the
fair
young
man
a
chap
inquired
the
inquisitive
foss
dowson
hesitated
she
said
defiantly
who
it
can
be
muttered
foss
in
perplexity
know
that
too
some
day
no
doubt
was
the
reply
glad
it
to
be
a
chap
he
said
that
i
think
flora
believes
in
such
rubbish
as
she
too
do
said
flora
should
she
know
all
the
things
i
did
when
i
was
a
little
girl
tell
me
believe
in
it
too
said
dowson
you
tell
me
not
sensible
foss
quailed
at
the
challenge
and
relapsed
into
moody
silence
the
talk
turned
on
an
aunt
of
lippet
rumored
to
possess
money
and
an
uncle
who
was
in
it
he
began
to
feel
in
the
way
and
only
his
native
obstinacy
prevented
him
from
going
it
was
a
relief
to
him
when
the
front
door
opened
and
the
heavy
step
of
dowson
was
heard
in
the
tiny
passage
if
anything
it
seemed
heavier
than
usual
and
dowson
manner
when
he
entered
the
room
and
greeted
his
guests
was
singularly
lacking
in
its
usual
cheerfulness
he
drew
a
chair
to
the
fire
and
putting
his
feet
on
the
fender
gazed
moodily
between
the
bars
been
wondering
as
i
came
along
he
said
at
last
with
an
obvious
attempt
to
speak
carelessly
this
as
been
hearing
so
much
about
lately
always
comes
out
depends
on
the
said
his
wife
mean
said
dowson
slowly
mean
that
gypsy
woman
that
charlie
and
flora
went
course
it
does
snapped
his
wife
trust
what
she
says
afore
know
five
or
six
that
she
has
told
said
lippet
plucking
up
courage
they
all
believe
they
could
help
themselves
they
said
she
might
make
a
mistake
sometimes
said
dowson
faintly
get
mixed
up
so
to
said
dowson
firmly
echoed
flora
and
lippet
dowson
heaved
a
big
sigh
and
his
eye
wandered
round
the
room
it
lighted
on
foss
an
old
humbug
said
that
gentleman
a
good
mind
to
put
the
police
on
to
dowson
reached
over
and
gripped
his
hand
then
he
sighed
again
course
it
suits
charlie
foss
to
say
so
said
dowson
he
say
so
he
got
reasons
i
believe
every
word
she
says
if
she
told
me
i
was
coming
in
for
a
fortune
i
should
believe
her
and
if
she
told
me
i
was
going
to
have
misfortunes
i
should
believe
say
that
shouted
dowson
with
startling
energy
say
that
that
what
she
did
say
cried
his
wife
sharply
are
you
talking
about
won
eighteenpence
off
of
bob
stevens
said
her
husband
staring
at
the
table
is
price
for
telling
the
future
only
and
being
curious
and
feeling
i
like
to
know
what
going
to
to
me
i
went
in
and
had
you
upset
said
dowson
with
a
quick
glance
at
him
get
upstairs
to
sooner
stay
said
her
husband
resuming
his
seat
seems
more
cheerful
and
lifelike
i
wish
i
gorn
that
what
i
did
she
tell
you
inquired
foss
dowson
thrust
his
hands
into
his
trouser
pockets
and
spoke
desperately
says
i
to
live
to
ninety
and
i
to
travel
to
foreign
get
to
bed
said
his
wife
dowson
shook
his
head
doggedly
to
be
rich
he
continued
and
loved
after
my
pore
dear
wife
death
i
to
marry
again
a
young
woman
with
money
and
stormy
brown
dowson
sprang
from
her
chair
and
stood
over
him
quivering
with
passion
dare
you
she
gasped
been
two
said
her
husband
solemnly
should
the
second
only
i
felt
so
miserable
i
know
i
be
with
a
young
dowson
past
speech
sank
back
in
her
chair
and
stared
at
him
should
worry
about
it
if
i
was
you
dowson
said
foss
kindly
what
she
said
about
me
that
ought
to
show
you
she
to
be
relied
like
lamps
said
dowson
musingly
i
next
month
well
they
do
say
every
eye
its
own
idea
of
a
strange
sound
half
laugh
and
half
cry
broke
from
the
lips
of
the
dowson
she
controlled
herself
by
an
effort
she
said
it
she
said
doggedly
with
a
fierce
glance
at
foss
come
true
if
after
my
death
my
is
going
to
marry
a
young
woman
brown
eyes
interjected
foss
softly
his
fate
and
it
ca
be
avoided
concluded
dowson
it
so
soon
said
the
unfortunate
husband
to
die
in
three
weeks
and
i
to
be
married
three
months
dowson
moistened
her
lips
and
tried
but
in
vain
to
avoid
the
glittering
eye
of
foss
she
said
mechanically
three
weeks
be
frightened
said
foss
in
a
winning
voice
believe
it
and
besides
we
shall
soon
see
and
if
you
do
die
in
three
weeks
perhaps
i
get
five
years
for
bigamy
and
perhaps
flora
wo
marry
a
fair
man
with
millions
of
money
and
perhaps
she
is
wrong
after
all
mother
said
dowson
hopefully
dowson
gave
him
a
singularly
unkind
look
for
one
about
to
leave
him
so
soon
and
afraid
to
trust
herself
to
speech
left
the
room
and
went
as
the
door
closed
behind
her
foss
took
the
chair
which
lippet
had
thoughtlessly
vacated
and
offered
such
consolations
to
flora
as
he
considered
suitable
to
the
occasion
odd
man
out
the
night
watchman
pursed
up
his
lips
and
shook
his
head
friendship
he
said
decidedly
is
a
deloosion
and
a
snare
i
more
friendships
in
my
life
than
most
to
being
took
a
fancy
to
for
some
reason
or
they
nearly
all
came
to
a
sudden
ending
he
said
decidedly
is
a
deloosion
and
a
snare
i
remember
one
man
who
used
to
think
i
could
do
wrong
everything
i
did
was
right
to
and
now
if
i
pass
in
the
street
he
makes
a
face
as
if
he
got
a
hair
in
mouth
all
because
i
told
the
truth
one
day
when
he
was
thinking
of
getting
married
being
a
bit
in
his
mind
he
asked
me
supposing
i
was
a
gal
his
looks
would
strike
me
it
was
an
orkard
question
and
i
told
him
that
he
got
a
good
and
that
no
man
could
a
better
pal
i
said
he
got
a
good
temper
and
was
free
with
money
o
course
that
did
satisfy
and
at
last
he
told
me
to
take
a
good
look
at
and
tell
him
wot
i
thought
of
looks
there
was
no
getting
out
of
it
and
at
last
i
to
tell
him
plain
that
everybody
ideas
about
looks
that
looks
everything
and
that
is
as
does
even
then
satisfied
and
at
last
i
told
speaking
as
a
pal
to
a
pal
that
if
i
was
a
gal
and
he
came
along
trying
to
court
me
i
should
go
to
the
police
about
it
i
remember
two
young
fellers
that
was
shipmates
with
me
some
years
ago
and
they
was
such
pals
that
everybody
called
the
siamese
twins
they
always
shipped
together
and
shared
lodgings
together
when
they
was
ashore
and
ted
denver
would
no
more
thought
of
going
out
without
charlie
brice
than
charlie
brice
would
thought
of
going
out
without
they
shared
their
baccy
and
their
money
and
everything
else
and
it
my
opinion
that
if
they
only
one
pair
o
boots
between
they
hopped
along
in
one
each
they
been
like
it
for
years
and
they
kept
it
up
when
they
left
the
sea
and
got
berths
ashore
anybody
knowing
them
would
ha
thought
that
nothing
but
death
could
part
but
it
happened
otherwise
there
was
a
gal
in
it
of
course
a
gal
that
ted
denver
got
into
conversation
with
on
top
of
a
bus
owing
to
her
steadying
by
putting
her
hand
on
shoulder
as
she
passed
bright
lively
sort
o
gal
she
seemed
and
afore
ted
knew
where
he
was
they
was
talking
away
as
though
they
known
each
other
for
years
charlie
did
seem
to
care
much
for
it
at
fust
but
he
did
raise
no
objection
and
when
the
gal
got
up
to
go
he
stopped
the
bus
for
by
poking
the
driver
in
the
back
and
they
all
got
off
together
ted
went
fust
to
break
her
fall
in
case
the
bus
started
off
too
sudden
and
charlie
her
down
behind
by
catching
hold
of
a
lace
collar
she
was
wearing
when
she
turned
to
speak
to
about
it
she
knocked
the
conductor
hat
off
with
umbrella
and
there
was
so
much
unpleasantness
that
by
the
time
they
got
to
the
pavement
she
told
charlie
that
she
never
wanted
to
see
his
silly
fat
face
agin
ai
fat
ses
ted
speaking
up
for
the
shape
of
it
ai
silly
ses
charlie
speaking
very
quick
that
a
bit
o
real
lace
ses
the
gal
twisting
her
round
to
look
at
the
collar

me
one
and
only

an

charlie
who
not
being
a
married

and
three
farthings

understand
that
ses
charlie
cleverer
than
he
looks
ses
the
gal
turning
to
ted
you
right
and
it
is
the
shape
after
ted
walked
along
one
side
of
and
charlie
the
other
till
they
came
to
the
corner
of
the
road
where
she
lived
and
then
ted
and
stood
there
talking
till
charlie
got
sick
and
tired
of
it
and
kept
tugging
at
ted
coat
for
to
come
away
coming
ses
ted
at
last
you
wo
be
this
way

to

in
his
oar
going
to
a
go

your
blessed

gal
to
ted
do
want
she
turned
round
and
ran
up
the
road
with
ted
follering
and
begging
of
not
to
be
so
hasty
and
afore
they
parted
she
told
that
name
was
emma
white
and
promised
to
meet
there
the
next
night
at
seven
o
course
charlie
brice
turned
up
alongside
o
ted
the
next
night
and
at
fust
emma
said
she
was
going
straight
off
agin
she
did
go
part
o
the
way
and
then
when
she
found
that
ted
would
send
his
mate
off
she
came
back
and
said
as
she
was
going
to
go
just
to
please
charlie
brice
she
would
speak
a
word
to
and
when
they
all
went
to
the
together
she
sat
with
her
face
turned
away
from
and
her
elbow
sticking
in
chest
doing
that
and
watching
the
performance
at
the
same
time
gave
a
stiff
neck
and
she
got
in
such
a
temper
over
it
she
would
hardly
speak
to
ted
and
when
to
rub
it
with

and
charlie
brice
jennings
all
alone
to
himself
for
over
a
couple
of
hours
walking
up
and
down
the
commercial
road
talking
about
the
weather
charles
saying
wet
and
cold
it

and
thinking
they

they
shook

said
they
both
better
keep
it
to

a
bit
and
wait
until
emma
got
more
used
to
charlie
afore
they
told
her
ted
let
get
used
to
for
three
days
more
afore
he
broke
the
news
to
and
the
way
she
went
on
was
alarming
she
went
on
for
over
ten
minutes
without
taking
breath
and
she
was
just
going
to
start
again
when
jennings
stopped
her
all
right
she
ses
leave
not
touching
ses
emma
very
scornful
leave
alone
ses
jennings
taking
hold
of
charlie
arm
do
say
things
about
your
young
charlie
brice
started
as
if
he
been
shot
and
twice
he
opened
mouth
to
speak
and
show
jennings
mistake
but
wot
with
trying
to
find
voice
in
the
fust
place
and
then
finding
words
to
use
it
with
in
the
second
he
did
say
anything
he
just
walked
along
gasping
with
mouth
open
like
a
fish
take
no
notice
of
charlie
ses
jennings
do
mind
wot
she
ses
ses
pore
charlie
you
making
a
is
emma
ses
jennings
there
so
am
wot
you
might
call
a
generous
temper
but
charlie
went
cold
all
over
me
well
and
i
treat
other
people
well
ses
jennings
ca
say
fairer
than
that
can
i
charlie
said
could
and
then
walked
along
with
her
hanging
on
to
arm
arf
wondering
whether
it
would
be
wrong
to
shove
under
a
bus
that
was
passing
and
arf
wondering
whether
could
do
it
if
it
was
for
emma
saying
she
wo
you
for
a
lodger
ses
jennings
wait
till
she
asked
she
wait
a
long
time
if
i
my
charlie
did
answer
her
he
walked
along
with
mouth
shut
his
idea
being
that
the
least
said
the
soonest
mended
even
emma
asked
at
last
whether
he
lost
tongue
and
said
it
was
curious
different
love
took
different
people
he
talked
fast
enough
going
with
ted
though
and
pretty
near
lost
temper
with
when
ted
asked
why
he
did
tell
jennings
straight
that
she
made
a
mistake
knows
well
enough
he
says
grinding
teeth
was
just
trying
it
on
that

you
to

between

did
think
anybody
could
parted
us
like
ted
said
it
was
all
nonsense
but
it
was
no
good
and
the
next
night
he
went
off
alone
and
came
back
very
cross
saying
that

all
the
time
and
when
spoke
to
emma
about

she
said

just
tit
for

and
reminded
she

to
put
up
with

four
nights

out
for
walks
with

of

miserable
for

until
at

house
at
an
absurdly
low
rent
and
nobody
will
take
it
it
has
taken
toll
of
at
least
one
life
of
every
family
that
has
lived
short
the
since
it
has
stood
empty
caretaker
after
caretaker
has
died
there
the
last
caretaker
died
fifteen
years
said
barnes
enough
ago
for
legends
to
bet
you
a
sovereign
you
wo
spend
the
night
there
alone
for
all
your
talk
said
white
suddenly
i
said
lester
said
barnes
slowly
do
believe
in
ghosts
nor
in
any
supernatural
things
whatever
all
the
same
i
admit
that
i
should
not
care
to
pass
a
night
there
why
not
inquired
white
in
the
chimney
said
meagle
with
a
grin
in
the
wainscot
chimed
in
lester
you
like
said
barnes
coloring
we
all
go
said
meagle
after
supper
and
get
there
about
eleven
we
have
been
walking
for
ten
days
now
without
an
barnes
discovery
that
ditchwater
smells
longest
it
will
be
a
novelty
at
any
rate
and
if
we
break
the
spell
by
all
surviving
the
grateful
owner
ought
to
come
down
see
what
the
landlord
has
to
say
about
it
first
said
lester
is
no
fun
in
passing
a
night
in
an
ordinary
empty
house
let
us
make
sure
that
it
is
he
rang
the
bell
and
sending
for
the
landlord
appealed
to
him
in
the
name
of
our
common
humanity
not
to
let
them
waste
a
night
watching
in
a
house
in
which
spectres
and
hobgoblins
had
no
part
the
reply
was
more
than
reassuring
and
the
landlord
after
describing
with
considerable
art
the
exact
appearance
of
a
head
which
had
been
seen
hanging
out
of
a
window
in
the
moonlight
wound
up
with
a
polite
but
urgent
request
that
they
would
settle
his
bill
before
they
went
all
very
well
for
you
young
gentlemen
to
have
your
fun
he
said
indulgently
supposing
as
how
you
are
all
found
dead
in
the
morning
what
about
me
it
ai
called
the
for
nothing
you
died
there
last
inquired
barnes
with
an
air
of
polite
derision
tramp
was
the
reply
went
there
for
the
sake
of
half
a
crown
and
they
found
him
next
morning
hanging
from
the
balusters
said
barnes
the
landlord
nodded
what
the
jury
brought
it
in
he
said
slowly
his
mind
was
sound
enough
when
he
went
in
there
i
known
him
off
and
on
for
years
i
a
poor
man
but
i
would
spend
the
night
in
that
house
for
a
hundred
a
poor
man
but
i
would
spend
the
night
in
that
house
for
a
hundred
pounds
he
repeated
this
remark
as
they
started
on
their
expedition
a
few
hours
later
they
left
as
the
inn
was
closing
for
the
night
bolts
shot
noisily
behind
them
and
as
the
regular
customers
trudged
slowly
homewards
they
set
off
at
a
brisk
pace
in
the
direction
of
the
house
most
of
the
cottages
were
already
in
darkness
and
lights
in
others
went
out
as
they
passed
seems
rather
hard
that
we
have
got
to
lose
a
night
rest
in
order
to
convince
barnes
of
the
existence
of
ghosts
said
white
in
a
good
cause
said
meagle
most
worthy
object
and
something
seems
to
tell
me
that
we
shall
succeed
you
did
forget
the
candles
lester
have
brought
two
was
the
reply
the
old
man
could
there
was
but
little
moon
and
the
night
was
cloudy
the
road
between
high
hedges
was
dark
and
in
one
place
where
it
ran
through
a
wood
so
black
that
they
twice
stumbled
in
the
uneven
ground
at
the
side
of
it
leaving
our
comfortable
beds
for
this
said
white
again
me
see
this
desirable
residential
sepulchre
lies
to
the
right
it
on
said
meagle
they
walked
on
for
some
time
in
silence
broken
only
by
white
tribute
to
the
softness
the
cleanliness
and
the
comfort
of
the
bed
which
was
receding
farther
and
farther
into
the
distance
under
meagle
guidance
they
turned
off
at
last
to
the
right
and
after
a
walk
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
saw
the
gates
of
the
house
before
them
saw
the
gates
of
the
house
before
them
the
lodge
was
almost
hidden
by
overgrown
shrubs
and
the
drive
was
choked
with
rank
growths
meagle
leading
they
pushed
through
it
until
the
dark
pile
of
the
house
loomed
above
them
is
a
window
at
the
back
where
we
can
get
in
so
the
landlord
says
said
lester
as
they
stood
before
the
hall
door
said
meagle
let
do
the
thing
properly
the
knocker
he
felt
for
it
in
the
darkness
and
gave
a
thundering
at
the
door
play
the
fool
said
barnes
crossly
servants
are
all
asleep
said
meagle
gravely
i
wake
them
up
before
i
done
with
them
it
scandalous
keeping
us
out
here
in
the
he
plied
the
knocker
again
and
the
noise
volleyed
in
the
emptiness
beyond
then
with
a
sudden
exclamation
he
put
out
his
hands
and
stumbled
forward
it
was
open
all
the
time
he
said
with
an
odd
catch
in
his
voice
do
believe
it
was
open
said
lester
hanging
back
is
playing
us
a
said
meagle
sharply
me
a
candle
thanks
who
got
a
match
barnes
produced
a
box
and
struck
one
and
meagle
shielding
the
candle
with
his
hand
led
the
way
forward
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
door
somebody
he
said
too
much
is
shut
said
white
glancing
behind
him
meagle
fingered
his
chin
shut
it
he
inquired
looking
from
one
to
the
other
came
in
last
did
said
lester
i
do
remember
shutting
i
did
meagle
about
to
speak
thought
better
of
it
and
still
carefully
guarding
the
flame
began
to
explore
the
house
with
the
others
close
behind
shadows
danced
on
the
walls
and
lurked
in
the
corners
as
they
proceeded
at
the
end
of
the
passage
they
found
a
second
staircase
and
ascending
it
slowly
gained
the
first
floor
said
meagle
as
they
gained
the
landing
he
held
the
candle
forward
and
showed
where
the
balusters
had
broken
away
then
he
peered
curiously
into
the
void
beneath
is
where
the
tramp
hanged
himself
i
suppose
he
said
thoughtfully
got
an
unwholesome
mind
said
white
as
they
walked
on
place
is
quite
creepy
enough
without
your
remembering
that
now
find
a
comfortable
room
and
have
a
little
nip
of
whiskey
apiece
and
a
pipe
how
will
this
do
he
opened
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
revealed
a
small
square
room
meagle
led
the
way
with
the
candle
and
first
melting
a
drop
or
two
of
tallow
stuck
it
on
the
mantelpiece
the
others
seated
themselves
on
the
floor
and
watched
pleasantly
as
white
drew
from
his
pocket
a
small
bottle
of
whiskey
and
a
tin
cup
i
forgotten
the
water
he
exclaimed
soon
get
some
said
meagle
he
tugged
violently
at
the
and
the
rusty
jangling
of
a
bell
sounded
from
a
distant
kitchen
he
rang
again
play
the
fool
said
barnes
roughly
meagle
laughed
only
wanted
to
convince
you
he
said
kindly
ought
to
be
at
any
rate
one
ghost
in
the
servants
barnes
held
up
his
hand
for
silence
said
meagle
with
a
grin
at
the
other
two
anybody
coming
we
drop
this
game
and
go
back
said
barnes
suddenly
believe
in
spirits
but
nerves
are
outside
anybody
command
you
may
laugh
as
you
like
but
it
really
seemed
to
me
that
i
heard
a
door
open
below
and
steps
on
the
his
voice
was
drowned
in
a
roar
of
laughter
is
coming
round
said
meagle
with
a
smirk
the
time
i
have
done
with
him
he
will
be
a
confirmed
believer
well
who
will
go
and
get
some
water
will
you
barnes
was
the
reply
there
is
any
it
might
not
be
safe
to
drink
after
all
these
years
said
lester
must
do
without
meagle
nodded
and
taking
a
seat
on
the
floor
held
out
his
hand
for
the
cup
pipes
were
lit
and
the
clean
wholesome
smell
of
tobacco
filled
the
room
white
produced
a
pack
of
cards
talk
and
laughter
rang
through
the
room
and
died
away
reluctantly
in
distant
corridors
rooms
always
delude
me
into
the
belief
that
i
possess
a
deep
voice
said
meagle
he
started
up
with
a
smothered
exclamation
as
the
light
went
out
suddenly
and
something
struck
him
on
the
head
the
others
sprang
to
their
feet
then
meagle
laughed
the
candle
he
exclaimed
did
stick
it
barnes
struck
a
match
and
relighting
the
candle
stuck
it
on
the
mantelpiece
and
sitting
down
took
up
his
cards
again
was
i
going
to
say
said
meagle
i
know
said
white
laying
his
hand
on
the
other
sleeve
my
word
i
really
thought
i
heard
a
here
said
barnes
do
you
say
to
going
back
i
had
enough
of
this
i
keep
fancying
that
i
hear
things
too
sounds
of
something
moving
about
in
the
passage
outside
i
know
it
only
fancy
but
it
go
if
you
want
to
said
meagle
we
will
play
dummy
or
you
might
ask
the
tramp
to
take
your
hand
for
you
as
you
go
barnes
shivered
and
exclaimed
angrily
he
got
up
and
walking
to
the
door
listened
outside
said
meagle
winking
at
the
other
two
dare
you
to
go
down
to
the
hall
door
and
back
by
barnes
came
back
and
bending
forward
lit
his
pipe
at
the
candle
am
nervous
but
rational
he
said
blowing
out
a
thin
cloud
of
smoke
nerves
tell
me
that
there
is
something
prowling
up
and
down
the
long
passage
outside
my
reason
tells
me
that
it
is
all
nonsense
where
are
my
cards
he
sat
down
again
and
taking
up
his
hand
looked
through
it
carefully
and
led
play
white
he
said
after
a
pause
white
made
no
sign
he
is
asleep
said
meagle
up
old
man
wake
up
and
lester
who
was
sitting
next
to
him
took
the
sleeping
man
by
the
arm
and
shook
him
gently
at
first
and
then
with
some
roughness
but
white
with
his
back
against
the
wall
and
his
head
bowed
made
no
sign
meagle
bawled
in
his
ear
and
then
turned
a
puzzled
face
to
the
others
sleeps
like
the
dead
he
said
grimacing
there
are
still
three
of
us
to
keep
each
other
said
lester
nodding
lord
he
broke
off
and
eyed
them
trembling
what
inquired
meagle
stammered
lester
wake
him
try
him
again
white
white
no
good
said
meagle
seriously
something
wrong
about
that
what
i
meant
said
lester
if
he
goes
to
sleep
like
that
why
meagle
sprang
to
his
feet
he
said
roughly
tired
out
that
all
still
let
take
him
up
and
clear
out
you
take
his
legs
and
barnes
will
lead
the
way
with
the
candle
yes
who
that
he
looked
up
quickly
towards
the
door
i
heard
somebody
tap
he
said
with
a
shamefaced
laugh
lester
up
with
him
one
lester
lester
he
sprang
forward
too
late
lester
with
his
face
buried
in
his
arms
had
rolled
over
on
the
floor
fast
asleep
and
his
utmost
efforts
failed
to
awaken
him
he
stammered
barnes
who
had
taken
the
candle
from
the
stood
peering
at
the
sleepers
in
silence
and
dropping
tallow
over
the
floor
stood
peering
at
the
sleepers
in
silence
and
dropping
tallow
over
the
floor
must
get
out
of
this
said
meagle
barnes
hesitated
ca
leave
them
he
began
must
said
meagle
in
strident
tones
you
go
to
sleep
i
shall
he
seized
the
other
by
the
arm
and
strove
to
drag
him
to
the
door
barnes
shook
him
off
and
putting
the
candle
back
on
the
mantelpiece
tried
again
to
arouse
the
sleepers
no
good
he
said
at
last
and
turning
from
them
watched
meagle
you
go
to
sleep
he
said
anxiously
meagle
shook
his
head
and
they
stood
for
some
time
in
uneasy
silence
as
well
shut
the
door
said
barnes
at
last
he
crossed
over
and
closed
it
gently
then
at
a
scuffling
noise
behind
him
he
turned
and
saw
meagle
in
a
heap
on
the
hearthstone
with
a
sharp
catch
in
his
breath
he
stood
motionless
inside
the
room
the
candle
fluttering
in
the
draught
showed
dimly
the
grotesque
attitudes
of
the
sleepers
beyond
the
door
there
seemed
to
his
imagination
a
strange
and
stealthy
unrest
he
tried
to
whistle
but
his
lips
were
parched
and
in
a
mechanical
fashion
he
stooped
and
began
to
pick
up
the
cards
which
littered
the
floor
he
stopped
once
or
twice
and
stood
with
bent
head
listening
the
unrest
outside
seemed
to
increase
a
loud
creaking
sounded
from
the
stairs
is
there
he
cried
loudly
the
creaking
ceased
he
crossed
to
the
door
and
flinging
it
open
strode
out
into
the
corridor
as
he
walked
his
fears
left
him
suddenly
on
he
cried
with
a
low
laugh
of
you
all
of
you
show
your
infernal
ugly
faces
do
skulk
he
laughed
again
and
walked
on
and
the
heap
in
the
fireplace
put
out
his
head
tortoise
fashion
and
listened
in
horror
to
the
retreating
footsteps
not
until
they
had
become
inaudible
in
the
distance
did
the
listeners
features
relax
lord
lester
we
driven
him
mad
he
said
in
a
frightened
whisper
must
go
after
there
was
no
reply
meagle
sprung
to
his
feet
you
hear
he
cried
your
fooling
now
this
is
serious
white
lester
do
you
hear
he
bent
and
surveyed
them
in
angry
bewilderment
right
he
said
in
a
trembling
voice
wo
frighten
me
you
he
turned
away
and
walked
with
exaggerated
carelessness
in
the
direction
of
the
door
he
even
went
outside
and
peeped
through
the
crack
but
the
sleepers
did
not
stir
he
glanced
into
the
blackness
behind
and
then
came
hastily
into
the
room
again
he
stood
for
a
few
seconds
regarding
them
the
stillness
in
the
house
was
horrible
he
could
not
even
hear
them
breathe
with
a
sudden
resolution
he
snatched
the
candle
from
the
mantelpiece
and
held
the
flame
to
white
finger
then
as
he
reeled
back
stupefied
the
footsteps
again
became
audible
he
stood
with
the
candle
in
his
shaking
hand
listening
he
heard
them
ascending
the
farther
staircase
but
they
stopped
suddenly
as
he
went
to
the
door
he
walked
a
little
way
along
the
passage
and
they
went
scurrying
down
the
stairs
and
then
at
a
along
the
corridor
below
he
went
back
to
the
main
staircase
and
they
ceased
again
for
a
time
he
hung
over
the
balusters
listening
and
trying
to
pierce
the
blackness
below
then
slowly
step
by
step
he
made
his
way
downstairs
and
holding
the
candle
above
his
head
peered
about
him
he
called
are
you
shaking
with
fright
he
made
his
way
along
the
passage
and
summoning
up
all
his
courage
pushed
open
doors
and
gazed
fearfully
into
empty
rooms
then
quite
suddenly
he
heard
the
footsteps
in
front
of
him
he
followed
slowly
for
fear
of
extinguishing
the
candle
until
they
led
him
at
last
into
a
vast
bare
kitchen
with
damp
walls
and
a
broken
floor
in
front
of
him
a
door
leading
into
an
inside
room
had
just
closed
he
ran
towards
it
and
flung
it
open
and
a
cold
air
blew
out
the
candle
he
stood
aghast
a
vast
bare
kitchen
with
damp
walls
and
a
broken
floor
he
cried
again
be
afraid
it
is
there
was
no
answer
he
stood
gazing
into
the
darkness
and
all
the
time
the
idea
of
something
close
at
hand
watching
was
upon
him
then
suddenly
the
steps
broke
out
overhead
again
he
drew
back
hastily
and
passing
through
the
kitchen
groped
his
way
along
the
narrow
passages
he
could
now
see
better
in
the
darkness
and
finding
himself
at
last
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
began
to
ascend
it
noiselessly
he
reached
the
landing
just
in
time
to
see
a
figure
disappear
round
the
angle
of
a
wall
still
careful
to
make
no
noise
he
followed
the
sound
of
the
steps
until
they
led
him
to
the
top
floor
and
he
cornered
the
chase
at
the
end
of
a
short
passage
he
whispered
something
stirred
in
the
darkness
a
small
circular
window
at
the
end
of
the
passage
just
softened
the
blackness
and
revealed
the
dim
outlines
of
a
motionless
figure
meagle
in
place
of
advancing
stood
almost
as
still
as
a
sudden
horrible
doubt
took
possession
of
him
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
shape
in
front
he
fell
back
slowly
and
as
it
advanced
upon
him
burst
into
a
terrible
cry
for
god
sake
is
it
you
the
echoes
of
his
voice
left
the
air
quivering
but
the
figure
before
him
paid
no
heed
for
a
moment
he
tried
to
brace
his
courage
up
to
endure
its
approach
then
with
a
smothered
cry
he
turned
and
fled
the
passages
wound
like
a
maze
and
he
threaded
them
blindly
in
a
vain
search
for
the
stairs
if
he
could
get
down
and
open
the
hall
he
caught
his
breath
in
a
sob
the
steps
had
begun
again
at
a
lumbering
trot
they
clattered
up
and
down
the
bare
passages
in
and
out
up
and
down
as
though
in
search
of
him
he
stood
appalled
and
then
as
they
drew
near
entered
a
small
room
and
stood
behind
the
door
as
they
rushed
by
he
came
out
and
ran
swiftly
and
noiselessly
in
the
other
direction
and
in
a
moment
the
steps
were
after
him
he
found
the
long
corridor
and
raced
along
it
at
top
speed
the
stairs
he
knew
were
at
the
end
and
with
the
steps
close
behind
he
descended
them
in
blind
haste
the
steps
gained
on
him
and
he
shrank
to
the
side
to
let
them
pass
still
continuing
his
headlong
flight
then
suddenly
he
seemed
to
slip
off
the
earth
into
space
lester
awoke
in
the
morning
to
find
the
sunshine
streaming
into
the
room
and
white
sitting
up
and
regarding
with
some
perplexity
a
badly
blistered
finger
are
the
others
inquired
lester
i
suppose
said
white
must
have
been
lester
arose
and
stretching
his
stiffened
limbs
dusted
his
clothes
with
his
hands
and
went
out
into
the
corridor
white
followed
at
the
noise
of
their
approach
a
figure
which
had
been
lying
asleep
at
the
other
end
sat
up
and
revealed
the
face
of
barnes
i
been
asleep
he
said
in
surprise
do
remember
coming
here
how
did
i
get
here
place
to
come
for
a
nap
said
lester
severely
as
he
pointed
to
the
gap
in
the
balusters
there
another
yard
and
where
would
you
have
been
he
walked
carelessly
to
the
edge
and
looked
over
in
response
to
his
startled
cry
the
others
drew
near
and
all
three
stood
gazing
at
the
dead
man
below

sailormen
do
bother
much
about
their
relations
as
a
rule
said
the
sometimes
because
a
costs
as
much
as
a
barrel
o
beer
and
they
ai
got
the
money
for
both
and
sometimes
because
most
relations
run
away
with
the
idea
that
a
sailorman
has
been
knocking
about
over
the
world
just
to
bring
them
presents
then
agin
some
relations
are
partikler
about
appearances
and

do

a

in

soon

in
surprise
but
that
was
sam
all
over
the
idea
knowing
a
man
with
money
was
too
much
for
and
he
sat
there
giving
good
advice
to
peter
about
behavior
until
peter
did
know
whether
it
was
uncle
or
sam
he
took
the
room
and
wrote
the
letter
and
next
arternoon
at

and
by

was
bursting
with
curiosity
came
to
ask

to
lend

whether

ses
peter
all

goodman
said
they
was
wise

and
arter
a
little
more
talk
he
said

it
be
if
they
went
out
and
saw
a
little
bit
of
the
great
wicked
city
they
all
said
they
would
and
ginger
got
quite
excited
about
it
until
he
found
that
it
meant
london
they
got
on
a
bus
at
aldgate
and
fust
of
all
they
went
to
the
british
museum
and
when
goodman
was
tired
o
long
arter
the
others
went
into
a
place
and
a
nice
strong
cup
of
tea
and
a
piece
o
cake
each
when
they
come
out
o
there
they
all
walked
about
looking
at
the
shops
until
they
was
tired
out
and
arter
wot
goodman
said
was
a
very
improving
evening
they
all
went
sam
and
ginger
went
just
for
the
look
the
thing
and
arter
waiting
a
few
minutes
in
their
room
they
crept
downstairs
agin
to
spend
wot
was
left
of
the
evening
they
went
down
as
quiet
as
mice
but
for
all
that
just
as
they
was
passing
goodman
room
the
door
opened
and
peter
in
a
polite
voice
asked
to
step
inside
was
just
thinking
you
be
dull
up
there
all
alone
he
ses
sam
lost
presence
o
mind
and
afore
he
knew
wot
was
doing
and
ginger
walked
in
and
sat
down
they
sat
there
for
over
an
hour
and
a
talking
and
then
sam
with
a
look
at
ginger
said
they
must
be
going
because
he
got
to
call
for
a
pair
o
boots
he
left
to
be
mended
sam
wot
are
you
thinking
of
ses
peter
who
did
want
anybody
to
wot
he
could
the
shop
do
think
so
ses
sam
glaring
at
we
can
go
and
peter
said
he
go
with
and
just
as
they
got
to
the
door
goodman
said
he
go
too
o
course
the
shops
was
shut
and
arter
goodman
stood
on
tower
hill
admiring
the
tower
by
moonlight
till
sam
felt
ready
to
drop
they
all
walked
back
three
times
sam
come
undone
but
as
the
ethers
all
stopped
too
to
see
do
it
up
it
did
do
much
good
wot
with
temper
and
dryness
could
bid
peter
sam
and
ginger
something
the
next
morning
but
morning
ai
the
time
for
it
and
arter
they
had
dinner
goodman
asked
to
go
to
the
zoological
gardens
with
he
paid
for
them
all
and
he
a
lot
to
say
about
kindness
to
animals
and
you
could
do
anything
with
by
kindness
he
walked
about
the
place
talking
like
a
book
and
when
a
fat
monkey
wot
was
pretending
to
be
asleep
got
a
bit
sam
whisker
he
said
it
was
instink
and
the
animal
had
no
wish
to
do
likely
thought
it
was
doing
you
a
kindness
sam
ses
ginger
goodman
said
it
was
very
likely
afore
sam
could
speak
and
arter
walking
about
and
looking
at
the
other
things
they
come
out
and
a
nice
strong
cup
o
tea
same
as
they
the
day
before
and
then
walked
about
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
themselves
sam
got
tired
of
it
fust
and
catching
ginger
eye
said
he
thought
it
was
time
to
get
in
case
too
much
enjoyment
was
good
for
his
idea
was
to
get
off
with
ginger
and
make
a
night
of
it
and
when
found
peter
and
his
uncle
was
coming
too
he
began
to
think
that
things
was
looking
serious
do
want
to
spile
your
evening
he
says
very
perlite
must
get
to
mend
a
pair
o
trowsis
o
mine
but
there
no
need
for
you
to
come
and

you
ses
peter

then
i
going
off
to

early
ses
sam
too
ses

said
he

hardly
keep
eyes
open
they
got
on
a
bus
and
as
sam
was
about
to
foller
ginger
and
peter
on
top
goodman
took
hold
of
by
the
arm
and
said
they
go
inside
he
paid
two
penny
fares
and
while
sam
was
wondering
to
tell
that
it
would
be
threepence
each
the
bus
stopped
to
take
up
a
passenger
and
he
got
up
and
moved
to
the
door
gone
up
there
he
ses
pointing
afore
sam
could
stop
he
got
off
and
sam
full
o
surprise
got
off
too
and
follered
on
to
the
pavement
gone
up
there
he
ses
as

and
i
sam
said

very
tired
and
he
walked
along
wondering
whether
goodman
was
quite
right
in
his
for
one
thing
seemed
upset
about
something
or
other
and
kept
taking
little
peeps
at

a
way
he
could
understand

all
was
nice

this
arternoon

goodman
at

a
teetotaller
for

a
very
strict
teetotaller
ai
the
word
for
it
ses
sam
trying
to
do
duty
by
peter
all
right
ses
goodman
and
he
pushed
his
back
and
looked
at
sam
very
serious
they
walked
on
a
bit
further
and
then
uncle
stopped
sudden
just
as
they
was
passing
a
large
and
looked
at
sam
do
want
peter
to
know
it
might
alarm
he
ses
come
over
a
bit
faint
i
go
in
for
a
minnit
and
sit
down

in
with
you
in
case
you
want
help
ses
sam
do
mind
wot
people
goodman
tried
to
persuade
not
to
but
it
was
all
no
good
and
at
last
walked
in
and
sat
down
on
a
tall
stool
that
stood
agin
the
bar
and
put
his
hand
to
his
we
shall
to
something
he
ses
in
a
whisper
to
sam
ca
expect
to
come
in
and
sit
down
for
nothing
what
you

looked
at
but
he
might
just
as
well
ha
looked
at
a
brass
a
small
he
ses
at
last
very
small
small
ginger
ses
goodman
to
the
one
special
sam
could
believe
his
ears
and
he
stood
there
his
glass
o
and
watching
peter
teetotal
uncle
drink
whiskey
and
thought
must
be
dreaming
dessay
it
seems
very
shocking
to
you
ses
goodman
putting
down
glass
and
dryin
lips
on
each
other
i
find
it
useful
for
these
the
flavor
very
nasty
ses
sam
taking
a
sip
at
exactly
wot
you
could
call
nasty
ses
goodman
i
dessay
it
would
seem
so
to
you
i
do
suppose
you
could
swallow

i
could
ses
sam
i
a
good
mind
to
a
try

teetotaller

do
see
why
it
should
hurt

looked
at
very
hard
and
then
he
ordered
a
whiskey
and
stood
watching
while
sam
arter
pretending
for
a
minnit
to
look
at
it
as
though
did
know
wot
to
do
with
it
took
a
sip
and
let
it
roll
round

at

so
as
i
fancied

lapping
up

beating

side
of

and
keeping

alight
with

just
nodded
at

as
long
as

walking
about
the
streets
and
drinking
cups
o
must
try
and
alter
ses
sam
arter
doing
a
bit
o
thinking

goodman
laying

from

and
the
chimbleys
swept
to
welcome

ses
goodman
taking
a
sip
o
whiskey
be
a
little
surprise
for
they
stayed
till
it
was
over
and
on
the
bus
he
gave
sam
some
strong
peppermint
lozenges
wot
always
carried
about
with
and
took
some

helpful

we
going
to
tell
peter
and
ginger
ses
sam
as
they
got
near
the
ses
goodman
the
truth

when

looking
for
ever
since
i
not
going
to
my
spoilt

a
teetotal
nevvy

started
on
peter
wot

sitting
on
his
bed
with
ginger
waiting
for
them
the
moment
he
got
inside
and
all
ginger
and

ses
ses
sam
i
tell

been
waiting
for
you
ever
goodman
shook
his
at
no
more
about
it
he
ses
in
a
kind
voice
dessay
it
rather
tiresome
for
young
men
to
go
about
with
two
old
ones
and
in
future
if
you
and
peter
keep
together
me
and
my
friend
small
will
do
the
sam
shook
with
and
though
peter
tried
his
to
make
alter
his
mind
it
was
no
good
his
uncle
patted
on
the
shoulder
and
said
they
try
it
for
a
few
days
at
any
rate
and
ginger
wot
thought
it
was
a
very
good
idea
backed
up
everybody
seemed
pleased
with
the
idea
except
peter
russet
but
arter
sam
told
in
private
wot
a
high
opinion
uncle
got
of
and
well
off
he
was
gave
way
they
all
enjoyed
the
next
evening
and
sam
and
goodman
got
on
together
like
twin
brothers
they
went
to
a
place
of
amusement
every
night
and
the
unpleasantness
that
happened
was
when
peter
uncle
knocked
a
chemist
shop
up
at
a
twelve
one
night
to
buy
a
o
peppermint
lozenges
they
four
of
the
evenings
together
that
sam
ever
known
and
goodman
would
been
just
as
too
if
it
had
ha
been
for
the
thoughts
o
that
five
pounds
the
more
thought
of
it
the
more
unlikely
it
seemed
that
wife
would
blame
it
on
to
the
sweep
and
one
night
he
took
the
out
of
pocket
and
shook
his
over
it
till
sam
felt
quite
sorry
for
take
up
your
troubles
afore
they
come
he
ses
are
dangerous
goodman
cheered
up
a
bit
at
that
but
he
got
miserable
agin
the
next
night
because

was
getting
low
and
he
wanted

when

peter
and
ginger
went
on
eating
their
breakfast
but
every
time
peter
looked
up
he
caught
uncle
looking
at

such
a
surprised
and
disappointed
sort
o
way

he
reached
acrost
the
table
and
shook
with
peter
and
said
that
generosity
ran
in
their
family
and
something
seemed
to
tell
as
peter
would
lose
by
it
everybody
seemed
pleased
with
each
other
and
arter
ginger
dick
and
peter
gone

arter

bit
went
out

last
time

peter

he
was
laying
on
the
bed
with
eyes
shut
smiling
in
his
sleep
and
peter
russet
did
see

for
eighteen
months
the
head
of
the
family
letts
had
left
his
ship
by
mutual
arrangement
and
the
whole
of
the
crew
had
mustered
to
see
him
off
and
to
express
their
sense
of
relief
at
his
departure
after
some
years
spent
in
long
voyages
he
had
fancied
a
trip
on
a
coaster
as
a
change
and
the
schooner
curlew
having
no
use
for
a
ship
carpenter
had
shipped
as
cook
he
had
done
his
best
and
the
unpleasant
epithets
that
followed
him
along
the
quay
at
dunchurch
as
he
followed
in
the
wake
of
his
were
the
result
master
and
mate
nodded
in
grim
appreciation
of
the
crew
efforts
some
years
spent
in
long
he
put
his
chest
up
at
a
seamen
and
by
no
means
perturbed
at
this
sudden
change
in
his
fortunes
sat
on
a
seat
overlooking
the
sea
with
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
forming
plans
for
his
future
his
eyes
closed
and
he
opened
them
with
a
start
to
find
that
a
woman
of
pleasant
but
careworn
appearance
had
taken
the
other
end
of
the
bench
day
said
letts
lighting
another
cigarette
the
woman
assented
and
sat
looking
over
the
sea

letts
presently
was
the
surprised
reply
just
wanted
to
ask
you
how
long
you
would
boil
a
bit
o
beef
said
letts
from
curiosity
i
should
never
ship
as
cook
he
narrated
his
experience
of
the
last
few
days
and
finding
the
listener
sympathetic
talked
at
some
length
about
himself
and
his
voyages
also
of
his
plans
for
the
future
lost
my
son
at
sea
said
the
woman
with
a
sigh

him
letts
face
softened
he
said

i
suppose
he
would
have
been
like

other

nine
years
ago

just
a
my
age

the
woman

cleared
his
throat
sympathetically
father

a
week
after

the
other
three
months
afterwards
my
boy

went
down
two
years
ago

fool

i
do
know
why

because

me
of

much
as
you
like
said
letts
kindly
got
nothing
to
he
lit
another
cigarette
and
sitting
in
an
attitude
of
attention
listened
to
a
recital
of
domestic
trouble
that
made
him
congratulate
himself
upon
remaining
single
i
married
green
i
ca
call
my
soul
my
own
said
the
victim
of
matrimony
as
she
rose
to
depart
my
poor
boy
had
lived
things
would
have
been
different
his
father
left
the
house
and
furniture
to
him
and
that
all
my
second
married
me
for
i
sure
that
and
the
bit
o
money
that
was
left
to
me
he
selling
some
of
my
boy
furniture
at
this
very
moment
that
why
i
came
out
i
could
bear
he
turn
up
after
all
said
letts
say
green
shook
her
head
said
letts
regarding
you
do
let
lodgings
for
a
night
or
two
green
shook
her
head
again
do
matter
said
the
young
man
i
would
sooner
stay
with
you
than
at
a
i
taken
a
fancy
to
you
i
say
it
would
be
a
lark
if
you
did
and
i
went
there
and
your
husband
thought
i
was
your
son
would
it
green
caught
her
breath
and
sitting
down
again
took
his
arm
in
her
trembling
fingers
she
said
you
came
round
and
pretended
to
be
my
to
be
my
son
and
stood
up
for
me
letts
stared
at
her
in
amazement
and
then
began
to
laugh
would
know
continued
the
other
quickly
only
came
to
this
place
just
before
he
sailed
and
his
sister
was
only
ten
at
the
time
she
would
letts
said
he
could
think
of
it
and
sat
staring
with
an
air
of
great
determination
at
the
sea
arguments
and
entreaties
left
him
unmoved
and
he
was
just
about
to
express
his
sorrow
for
her
troubles
and
leave
when
she
gave
a
sudden
start
and
put
her
arm
through
his
comes
your
sister
she
exclaimed
letts
started
in
his
turn
has
seen
me
holding
your
arm
continued
green
in
a
tense
whisper
the
only
way
i
can
explain
it
mind
your
name
is
jack
foster
and
hers
is
letts
gazed
at
her
in
consternation
and
then
raising
his
eyes
regarded
with
much
approval
the
girl
who
was
approaching
it
seemed
impossible
that
she
could
be
green
daughter
and
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
he
nearly
said
so
said
green
in
a
voice
to
which
nervousness
had
imparted
almost
the
correct
this
is
your
brother
jack
letts
rose
sheepishly
and
then
to
his
great
amazement
a
pair
of
strong
young
arms
were
flung
round
his
neck
and
a
pair
of
warm
after
but
slight
his
then
and
there
letts
mind
was
made
up
and
there
letts
mind
was
made
up
jack
said
miss
foster
and
began
to
cry
softly
jack
said
green
and
moved
by
thoughts
perhaps
of
what
might
have
been
began
to
cry
too
there
said
letts
he
drew
miss
foster
to
the
seat
and
sitting
between
them
sat
with
an
arm
round
each
there
was
nothing
in
sight
but
a
sail
or
two
in
the
far
distance
and
he
allowed
miss
foster
head
to
lie
upon
his
shoulder
undisturbed
an
only
child
and
an
orphan
he
felt
for
the
first
time
the
blessing
of
a
sister
love
did
you
come
home
before
murmured
the
girl
letts
started
and
squinted
reproachfully
at
the
top
of
her
hat
then
he
turned
and
looked
at
green
in
search
of
the
required
information
was
shipwrecked
said
green
was
shipwrecked
repeated
letts
nodding
had
after
it
through
being
in
the
water
so
long
and
lost
his
memory
continued
green
wonderful
what
water
will
water
said
letts
in
confirmation
miss
foster
sighed
and
raising
the
hand
which
was
round
her
waist
bent
her
head
and
kissed
it
letts
colored
and
squeezed
her
convulsively
assisted
by
green
he
became
reminiscent
and
in
a
low
voice
narrated
such
incidents
of
his
career
as
had
escaped
the
assaults
of
the
that
his
head
was
not
permanently
injured
was
proved
by
the
perfect
manner
in
which
he
remembered
incidents
of
his
childhood
narrated
by
his
newly
found
mother
and
sister
he
even
volunteered
one
or
two
himself
which
had
happened
when
the
latter
was
a
year
or
two
old
now
said
green
in
a
somewhat
trembling
voice
must
go
and
tell
your
letts
responded
but
without
briskness
and
with
such
moral
support
as
an
arm
of
each
could
afford
walked
slowly
back
arrived
at
a
road
of
substantial
cottages
at
the
back
of
the
town
green
gasped
and
coming
to
a
standstill
nodded
at
a
van
that
stood
up
the
road
it
is
she
exclaimed
demanded
letts
furniture
i
told
you
about
said
green
furniture
that
your
poor
father
thought
such
a
lot
of
because
it
used
to
belong
to
his
grandfather
he
selling
it
to
simpson
though
i
begged
and
prayed
him
not
letts
encouraged
himself
with
a
deep
cough
furniture
he
demanded
green
took
courage
she
said
hopefully
father
left
it
to
letts
carrying
his
head
very
erect
took
a
firmer
grip
of
their
arms
and
gazed
steadily
at
a
man
who
was
eying
them
in
some
astonishment
from
the
doorway
with
arms
still
linked
they
found
the
narrow
gateway
somewhat
difficult
but
they
negotiated
it
by
a
turning
movement
and
standing
in
the
front
garden
waited
while
green
tried
to
find
her
voice
man
was
eying
them
in
some
astonishment
from
the
doorway
she
said
at
last
is
your
letts
in
some
difficulty
as
to
the
etiquette
on
such
occasions
released
his
right
arm
and
extended
his
hand
stepfather
he
said
cheerfully
green
drew
back
a
little
and
regarded
him
unfavorably
thought
you
was
drowned
he
said
at
last
was
nearly
said
letts
all
thought
so
pursued
green
grudgingly
thought
he
stood
aside
as
a
short
man
with
a
small
bureau
clasped
in
his
arms
and
supported
on
his
knees
emerged
from
the
house
and
staggered
towards
the
gate
letts
reflected
he
said
suddenly
are
you
moving
mother
green
sniffed
sadly
and
shook
her
head
said
letts
with
an
admirable
stare
that
chap
doing
with
my
furniture
spluttered
green
say
what
he
doing
with
my
furniture
repeated
letts
sternly
green
waved
his
arm
all
right
he
said
conclusively
bought
it
your
mother
it
ai
all
right
said
letts
bring
that
back
and
those
chairs
the
dealer
who
had
just
placed
the
bureau
on
the
of
the
van
came
back
wiping
his
brow
with
his
sleeve
the
little
game
he
demanded
letts
left
the
answer
to
green
and
going
to
the
van
took
up
the
bureau
and
walked
back
to
the
house
with
it
green
and
the
dealer
parted
a
little
at
his
approach
and
after
widening
the
parting
with
the
bureau
he
placed
it
in
the
front
room
while
he
went
back
for
the
chairs
he
came
back
with
three
of
them
and
was
not
without
reason
called
a
porcupine
by
the
indignant
dealer
he
was
relieved
to
find
after
simpson
had
taken
his
departure
that
green
was
in
no
mood
for
catechising
him
and
had
evidently
accepted
the
story
of
his
escape
and
return
as
a
particularly
disagreeable
fact
so
disagreeable
that
the
less
he
heard
of
it
the
better
hope
you
not
come
home
after
all
these
years
to
make
things
unpleasant
he
remarked
presently
as
they
sat
at
tea
could
be
unpleasant
if
i
tried
said
letts
been
very
happy
and
comfortable
and
your
mother
and
sister
continued
green

emily
said
his
wife
with
nervous
quickness
i

the
same

green
my
wish
that
you
should
make
yourself
quite
comfortable

to

letts
i
do
think
i
shall
go
to
sea

more
ship

my
trade
and
i
been
told
more
than
once
that
i
should
do
better
ashore
besides
i
do
want
to
lose
mother
and
betty
he
placed
his
arm
round
the
girl
waist
and
drawing
her
head
on
to
his
shoulder
met
with
a
blank
stare
the
troubled
gaze
of
green
told
there
wonderful
openings
for
carpenters
in
australia
said
green
trying
to
speak
in
level
tones
a
good
carpenter
can
make
a
fortune
there
in
ten
years
so
i
letts
with
a
slight
wink
at
green
and
a
reassuring
squeeze
with
his
left
arm
turned
an
attentive
ear
course
there
a
difficulty
he
said
slowly
as
green
finished
a
vivid
picture
of
the
joys
of
carpentering
in
australia
said
the
other
to
start
with
explained
letts
no
good
starting
without
money
i
wonder
how
much
this
house
and
furniture
would
fetch
is
it
all
mine
mother
of
it
stammered
green
gazing
in
a
fascinated
fashion
at
the
contorted
visage
of
her
husband
except
a
chair
in
the
kitchen
and
three
said
betty
when
you
spoke
to
miss
snarled
her
stepfather
we
married
we
mixed
our
furniture
up
it
up
so
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
tell
which
is
which
nobody
the
matter
o
that
you
could
have
all
the
kitchen
chairs
and
all
the
said
letts
generously
i
do
want
to
do
anything
in
a
hurry
and
i
should
dream
of
going
to
australia
without
betty
it
rests
with
going
to
be
married
said
green
hastily
if
she
she
would
turn
her
poor
ailing
mother
out
of
house
and
home
that
i
certain
of
she
not
that
sort
we
had
a
word
or
two
at
and
i
know
a
good
daughter
when
i
see
echoed
letts
as
his
left
arm
relaxed
its
pressure
to
fellow
o
the
name
of
henry
widden
replied
green
very
steady
young
fellow
a
great
friend
of
said
letts
blankly
got
an
idea
which
i
been
keeping
as
a
little
surprise
continued
green
speaking
very
rapidly
them
living
here
with
us
and
saving
and
letts
surveyed
him
with
a
dejected
eye
would
be
a
fine
start
for
them
continued
the
benevolent
green
letts
by
a
strong
effort
regained
his
composure
must
have
a
look
at
him
first
he
said
briskly
might
meet
with
my
said
green
starting
if
must
think
it
over
interrupted
letts
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
is
only
nineteen
and
as
head
of
the
family
i
do
think
she
can
marry
without
my
consent
i
not
sure
but
i
do
think
so
anyway
if
she
does
i
wo
have
her
husband
here
sitting
in
my
chairs
eating
off
my
tables
sleeping
in
my
beds
wearing
out
my
helping
it
said
miss
foster
calmly
letts
started
and
lost
the
thread
of
his
discourse
must
have
a
look
at
him
he
concluded
lamely
may
be
all
right
but
then
again
he
he
finished
his
tea
almost
in
silence
and
the
meal
over
emphasized
his
position
as
head
of
the
family
by
taking
the
a
piece
of
furniture
sacred
to
green
and
subjecting
that
injured
man
to
a
catechism
which
strained
his
powers
of
endurance
almost
to
i
make
any
change
at
present
said
letts
when
the
task
was
finished
plenty
of
room
here
for
us
all
and
so
long
as
you
and
me
agree
things
can
go
on
as
they
are
morning
i
shall
go
out
and
look
for
a
he
found
a
temporary
one
almost
at
once
and
determined
to
make
a
favorable
impression
worked
hard
all
day
he
came
home
tired
and
dirty
and
was
about
to
go
straight
to
the
to
make
his
toilet
when
green
called
him
in
friend
widden
he
said
with
a
satisfied
air
as
he
pointed
to
a
slight
fair
young
man
with
a
moustache
letts
shook
hands
day
said
widden
said
the
other
come
in
and
have
a
talk
about
it
when
i
had
a
and
miss
foster
are
going
out
for
a
bit
of
a
stroll
said
widden
right
agreed
letts
more
healthy
than
staying
indoors
all
the
evening
if
you
just
wait
while
i
have
a
wash
and
a
bit
something
to
eat
i
come
with
with
us
said
widden
after
an
astonished
pause
letts
nodded
see
i
do
know
you
yet
he
explained
as
head
of
the
family
i
want
to
see
how
you
behave
yourself
properly
speaking
my
consent
ought
to
have
been
asked
before
you
walked
out
with
her
still
as
everybody
thought
i
was
drowned
i
say
no
more
about
green
knows
all
about
me
said
widden
rebelliously
nothing
to
do
with
him
declared
letts
besides
not
what
i
should
call
a
judge
of
character
i
dare
say
you
are
all
right
but
i
going
to
see
for
myself
you
go
on
in
the
ordinary
way
with
your
without
taking
any
notice
of
me
try
and
forget
i
watching
you
be
as
natural
as
you
can
be
and
if
you
do
anything
i
do
like
i
soon
tell
you
of
the
bewildered
widden
turned
but
reading
no
hope
of
assistance
in
the
infuriated
eyes
of
green
appealed
in
despair
to
betty
do
mind
she
said
should
i
widden
could
have
supplied
her
with
many
reasons
but
he
refrained
and
sat
in
sulky
silence
while
letts
got
ready
from
his
point
of
view
the
experiment
was
by
no
means
a
success
his
efforts
to
be
natural
being
met
with
amazed
glances
from
letts
and
disdainful
requests
from
miss
foster
to
go
home
if
he
could
behave
himself
when
he
relapsed
into
moody
silence
letts
cleared
his
throat
and
spoke
no
need
to
be
like
a
and
at
the
same
time
there
no
need
to
be
sulky
he
pointed
out
a
happy
you
i
said
the
frantic
suitor
me
said
the
other
gravely
you
watch
fall
in
behind
and
he
drew
miss
foster
arm
through
his
and
leaning
towards
her
with
tender
deference
began
a
long
conversation
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
widden
intimated
that
he
thought
he
had
learned
enough
to
go
on
with
that
only
your
conceit
said
letts
over
his
shoulder
was
afraid
you
was
he
turned
to
miss
foster
again
and
widden
with
a
despairing
gesture
abandoned
himself
to
gloom
he
made
no
further
interruptions
but
at
the
conclusion
of
the
walk
hesitated
so
long
on
the
that
letts
had
to
take
the
initiative
he
said
shaking
hands
round
night
and
i
give
you
another
lesson
you
a
slow
learner
that
what
you
are
a
slow
he
gave
widden
a
lesson
on
the
following
evening
but
cautioned
him
sternly
against
imitating
the
display
of
brotherly
fondness
of
which
in
a
secluded
lane
he
had
been
a
observer
you
known
her
as
long
as
i
years
said
letts
as
the
other
protested
be
a
bit
different
i
might
not
be
here
for
one
by
exercise
of
great
widden
checked
the
obvious
retort
and
walked
doggedly
in
the
rear
of
miss
foster
then
hardly
able
to
believe
his
ears
he
heard
her
say
something
to
letts
said
that
gentleman
in
amazed
accents
fall
behind
said
miss
foster
not
the
way
to
talk
to
the
head
of
the
family
said
letts
feebly
the
way
i
talk
to
him
rejoined
the
girl
it
was
a
position
for
which
letts
was
totally
unprepared
and
the
satisfied
smile
of
widden
as
he
took
the
vacant
place
by
no
means
improved
matters
in
a
state
of
considerable
dismay
letts
dropped
farther
and
farther
behind
until
looking
up
he
saw
miss
foster
attended
by
her
restive
escort
quietly
waiting
for
him
an
odd
look
in
her
eyes
as
they
met
his
gave
him
food
for
thought
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
at
the
end
of
what
letts
was
pleased
to
term
a
month
trial
widden
was
still
unable
to
satisfy
him
as
to
his
fitness
for
the
position
of
in
a
spirit
of
gloom
he
made
suggestions
of
a
mutinous
nature
to
green
but
that
gentleman
who
had
returned
one
day
pale
and
furious
but
tamed
from
an
interview
that
related
to
his
treatment
of
his
wife
held
out
no
hopes
of
assistance
wash
my
hands
of
him
he
said
bitterly
stick
to
it
that
all
you
can
lost
me
last
night
said
the
unfortunate
stayed
behind
just
to
take
a
stone
out
of
my
shoe
and
the
earth
seemed
to
swallow
them
up
he
so
strong
that
the
worst
of
said
green
widden
nodded
evening
he
showed
her
how
he
upset
a
man
once
and
stood
him
on
his
head
he
said
irritably
was
what
he
showed
her
to
it
counselled
green
again
brother
and
sister
are
bound
to
get
tired
of
each
other
before
long
it
widden
sighed
and
obeyed
but
brother
and
sister
showed
no
signs
of
tiring
of
each
other
company
while
they
displayed
unmistakable
signs
of
weariness
with
his
and
three
weeks
later
letts
in
a
few
words
kindly
but
firmly
dismissed
him
should
never
give
my
consent
he
said
gravely
it
only
wasting
your
time
you
run
off
and
widden
ran
off
to
green
but
before
he
could
get
a
word
out
discovered
that
something
unusual
had
happened
green
a
picture
of
distress
sat
at
one
end
of
the
room
with
a
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
green
in
a
condition
compounded
of
joy
and
rage
was
striding
violently
up
and
down
the
room
a
fraud
he
shouted
fraud
i
had
my
suspicions
for
some
time
and
this
evening
i
got
it
out
of
widden
stared
in
amazement
got
it
out
of
her
repeated
green
pointing
at
the
trembling
woman
no
more
her
son
than
what
you
said
the
amazed
listener
been
deceiving
me
said
green
with
a
scowl
i
think
she
do
it
again
in
a
hurry
you
stay
here
he
shouted
as
his
wife
rose
to
leave
the
room
want
you
to
be
here
when
he
comes
green
stayed
and
the
other
two
heedless
of
her
presence
discussed
the
situation
until
the
front
door
was
heard
to
open
and
letts
and
betty
came
into
the
room
with
a
little
cry
the
girl
ran
to
her
mother
the
matter
she
cried
lost
another
son
said
green
with
a
ferocious
flash
bullying
ugly
chap
of
the
name
o
said
letts
starting
chap
she
picked
up
out
of
the
street
and
tried
to
pass
off
on
me
as
her
son
continued
green
raising
his
voice
ai
heard
the
end
of
it
yet
i
can
tell
letts
fidgeted
leave
her
alone
he
said
mildly
true
i
not
her
son
but
it
do
matter
because
i
been
to
see
a
lawyer
about
her
and
he
told
me
that
this
house
and
half
the
furniture
belongs
by
law
to
betty
it
got
nothing
to
do
with
said
green
you
take
yourself
off
before
i
put
the
police
on
to
you
take
your
face
off
these
letts
scratching
his
head
looked
vaguely
round
the
room
on
vociferated
green
will
you
have
the
police
to
put
you
out
letts
cleared
his
throat
and
moved
towards
the
door
stick
up
for
your
rights
my
girl
he
said
turning
to
betty
he
treat
your
mother
well
give
him
back
his
kitchen
chair
and
his
three
and
pack
him
said
green
with
dangerous
calm
and
fetch
a
going
said
letts
hastily
betty
mother
i
be
long
i
only
going
as
far
as
the
and
that
reminds
me
i
been
talking
so
much
that
i
quite
forget
to
tell
you
that
betty
and
me
were
married
yesterday
he
nodded
pleasantly
at
the
stupefied
green
and
turning
to
widden
gave
him
a
friendly
dig
in
the
ribs
with
his
finger
mine
is
betty
he
said
in
a
clear
voice
what
is
mine
d
understand
he
stepped
over
to
green
and
putting
a
strong
arm
around
her
raised
her
to
her
feet
what
mine
is
mother
he
concluded
and
helping
her
across
the
room
placed
her
in
the
best
mine
is
mother
prize
money
the
old
man
stood
by
the
window
gazing
at
the
frozen
fields
beyond
the
sign
of
the
cauliflower
was
stiff
with
snow
and
the
breath
of
a
pair
of
waiting
horses
in
a
wagon
beneath
ascended
in
clouds
of
steam
sign
of
the
cauliflower
was
stiff
with
snow
he
said
slowly
as
he
came
back
with
a
shiver
and
resuming
his
seat
by
the
fire
looked
at
the
wayfarer
who
had
been
idly
questioning
him
men
do
have
much
time
for
amusements
the
last
one
i
can
call
to
mind
was
bill
chambers
being
nailed
up
in
a
he
was
cleaning
out
but
there
was
such
a
fuss
made
over
that
it
sort
o
disheartened
he
got
up
again
restlessly
and
walking
round
the
table
gazed
long
and
hard
into
three
or
four
mugs
a
little
gets
left
in
them
he
explained
meeting
the
stranger
inquiring
glance
the
latter
started
and
knocking
on
the
table
with
the
handle
of
his
knife
explained
that
he
had
been
informed
by
a
man
outside
that
his
companion
was
the
bitterest
teetotaller
in
claybury
one
o
bob
pretty
larks
said
the
old
man
flushing
see
you
talking
to
and
i
thought
as
he
war
up
to
no
good
biggest
rascal
in
claybury
he
is
i
said
so
afore
and
i
say
so
he
bowed
to
the
donor
and
buried
his
old
face
in
the
mug
poacher
he
said
taking
breath
thief
he
continued
after
another
draught
wonder
whether
smith
spilt
any
of
this
of
it
in
he
put
down
the
empty
mug
and
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
floor
until
a
musical
rapping
on
the
table
brought
the
landlord
into
the
room
again
best
respects
he
said
gratefully
as
he
placed
the
mug
on
the
settle
by
his
side
and

soft
voice

would
listen

he
jumped
up
and
carried
on
like

madman
his
idea
was
for

club
together
to

the
money
and
to
borrow
it
from
smith
the
landlord
to
go
on
with

thought
of

they
intended

walker
to

alongside
of

beg
and
pray
of
to
take
the
money

as
a
favor
to

and
bought
the
hamper
back
with

said
so
double
dealing
fred
carter
stood
on
the
spacious
common
inhaling
with
all
the
joy
of
the
londoner
the
salt
smell
of
the
sea
below
and
regarding
with
some
interest
the
movements
of
a
couple
of
men
who
had
come
to
a
stop
a
short
distance
away
as
he
looked
they
came
on
again
eying
him
closely
as
they
strongly
built
shambling
man
of
fifty
and
a
younger
man
evidently
his
son
on
the
spacious
common
inhaling
the
salt
smell
of
the
sea
below
said
the
former
as
they
came
abreast
of
carter
he
replied
him
said
both
together
they
stood
regarding
him
in
a
fashion
unmistakably
hostile
carter
with
an
uneasy
smile
awaited
developments
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
demanded
the
elder
man
at
last
you
call
yourself
a
man
do
call
myself
anything
said
the
puzzled
carter
you
mistaking
me
for
somebody
i
tell
you
said
the
younger
man
turning
to
the
i
tell
you
he
say
that
can
say
what
he
likes
said
the
other
we
got
him
now
if
he
gets
away
from
me
he
be
cleverer
than
what
he
thinks
he
are
we
to
do
with
him
now
we
got
him
inquired
his
son
the
elder
man
clenched
a
huge
fist
and
eyed
carter
savagely
i
was
just
considering
myself
he
said
should
hammer
him
till
i
was
tired
and
then
chuck
him
into
the
his
son
nodded
would
do
nancy
much
good
though
he
remarked
want
to
do
everything
for
the
best
said
the
other
i
the
right
and
proper
thing
to
do
is
to
take
him
by
the
scruff
of
his
neck
and
run
him
along
to
try
it
said
carter
hotly
is
nancy
the
other
growled
and
was
about
to
aim
a
blow
at
him
when
his
son
threw
himself
upon
him
and
besought
him
to
be
calm
one
said
his
father
struggling
one
it
would
do
me
good
and
perhaps
he
come
along
the
quieter
for
here
said
carter
mistaking
me
for
somebody
else
that
what
you
are
doing
what
am
i
supposed
to
have
done
supposed
to
have
come
courting
my
daughter
somebody
else
said
the
other
releasing
himself
and
thrusting
his
face
into
carter
after
getting
her
promise
to
marry
you
nipping
off
to
london
to
arrange
for
the
wedding
she
been
mourning
over
you
for
four
years
now
having
an
idea
that
you
had
been
made
away
true
to
your
memory
you
skunk
said
the
son
wo
look
at
decent
chaps
that
want
to
marry
her
added
the
other
all
a
mistake
said
carter
came
down
here
this
morning
for
the
first
time
in
my
him
along
said
the
son
impatiently
a
waste
of
time
talking
to
carter
took
a
step
back
and
parleyed
come
along
with
you
of
my
own
free
will
he
said
hastily
to
show
you
that
you
are
wrong
but
i
wo
be
he
turned
and
walked
back
with
them
towards
the
town
pausing
occasionally
to
admire
the
view
once
he
paused
so
long
that
an
ominous
growl
arose
from
the
elder
of
his
captors
was
just
thinking
said
carter
eying
him
in
consternation
that
she
makes
the
same
mistake
that
you
have
made
oh
lord
it
up
pretty
well
do
he
jim
said
the
father
the
other
grunted
and
drawing
nearer
to
carter
as
they
entered
the
town
stepped
along
in
silence
questions
which
carter
asked
with
the
laudable
desire
of
showing
his
ignorance
concerning
the
neighborhood
elicited
no
reply
his
discomfiture
was
increased
by
the
behavior
of
an
elderly
boatman
who
after
looking
at
him
hard
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
bade
him
father
and
son
exchanged
significant
glances
elderly
boatman
who
after
looking
at
him
hard
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
bade
him
they
turned
at
last
into
a
small
street
and
the
elder
man
opening
the
door
of
a
neat
cottage
laid
his
hand
on
the
prisoner
shoulder
and
motioned
him
in
carter
obeyed
and
entering
a
spotless
removed
his
hat
and
with
affected
composure
seated
himself
in
an
go
up
and
tell
nan
said
jim
let
him
run
he
sprang
up
the
stairs
which
led
from
a
corner
of
the
room
and
the
next
moment
the
voice
of
a
young
lady
laboring
under
intense
excitement
fell
on
the
ears
of
carter
with
a
fine
attempt
at
unconcern
he
rose
and
inspected
an
aged
engraving
of
be
down
in
a
minute
said
jim
returning
it
as
well
that
i
did
set
about
him
after
all
said
his
father
i
had
done
what
i
should
like
to
do
his
own
mother
have
known
carter
sniffed
defiantly
and
with
a
bored
air
resumed
his
seat
ten
minutes
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
the
elder
impatience
found
vent
in
a
tirade
against
the
entire
sex
dressing
up
that
what
it
is
explained
jim
him
a
door
opened
above
and
a
step
sounded
on
the
stairs
carter
looked
up
uneasily
and
after
the
first
sensation
of
astonishment
had
passed
wondered
vaguely
what
his
double
had
run
away
for
the
girl
her
lips
parted
and
her
eyes
bright
came
swiftly
down
into
the
room
is
he
she
said
quickly
said
her
father
in
surprise
there
ca
you
see
the
light
died
out
of
the
girl
face
and
she
looked
round
in
dismay
the
watchful
carter
thought
that
he
also
detected
in
her
glance
a
spice
of
that
temper
which
had
made
her
relatives
so
objectionable
she
said
loudly
that
not
my
bert
what
i
told
said
carter
deferentially
and
over
said
her
father
loudly
i
looked
all
night
it
would
make
any
difference
said
the
disappointed
miss
evans
idea
of
making
such
a
mistake
all
liable
to
mistakes
said
carter
magnanimously
the
best
of
take
a
good
look
at
him
urged
her
brother
do
forget
that
it
four
years
since
you
saw
him
is
that
bert
nose
said
the
girl
glancing
at
the
feature
in
question
a
bit
like
it
bert
had
a
beautiful
at
his
eyes
said
jim
miss
evans
looked
and
meeting
carter
steady
gaze
tossed
her
head
scornfully
and
endeavored
to
stare
him
down
realizing
too
late
the
magnitude
of
the
task
but
unwilling
to
accept
defeat
she
stood
confronting
him
with
indignant
eyes
said
evans
misunderstanding
a
bit
like
said
his
daughter
turning
thankfully
if
you
do
like
bert
you
need
insult
she
sat
down
with
her
back
towards
carter
and
looked
out
at
the
window
i
could
ha
sworn
it
was
bert
simmons
said
the
discomfited
evans
too
said
his
son
ha
sworn
to
him
anywhere
it
the
most
extraordinary
likeness
i
ever
he
caught
his
father
eye
and
with
a
jerk
of
his
thumb
telegraphed
for
instructions
as
to
the
disposal
of
carter
can
go
said
evans
with
an
attempt
at
dignity
can
go
this
time
and
i
hope
that
this
be
a
lesson
to
him
not
to
go
about
looking
like
other
people
if
he
does
next
time
he
wo
escape
so
quite
right
said
carter
blandly
get
a
new
face
first
thing
morning
i
ought
to
have
done
it
he
crossed
to
the
door
and
nodding
to
the
fermenting
evans
bowed
to
the
profile
of
miss
evans
and
walked
slowly
out
envy
of
simmons
was
mingled
with
amazement
at
his
deplorable
lack
of
taste
and
common
sense
he
would
willingly
have
changed
places
with
him
there
was
evidently
a
strong
likeness
busy
with
his
thoughts
he
came
to
a
standstill
in
the
centre
of
the
footpath
and
then
with
a
sudden
air
of
determination
walked
slowly
back
to
the
house
said
evans
as
the
door
opened
and
the
face
of
carter
was
thrust
in
have
you
come
back
for
the
other
stepped
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
softly
behind
him
have
come
back
he
said
have
come
back
because
i
feel
ashamed
of
of
yourself
repeated
evans
rising
and
confronting
him
carter
hung
his
head
and
gazed
nervously
in
the
direction
of
the
girl
ca
keep
up
this
deception
he
said
in
a
low
but
distinct
voice
am
bert
simmons
at
least
that
is
the
name
i
told
you
four
years
knew
i
had
made
a
mistake
roared
evans
to
his
son
knew
him
well
enough
shut
the
door
jim
do
let
him
do
want
to
go
said
carter
with
a
glance
in
the
direction
of
nancy
have
come
back
to
make
nancy
not
knowing
him
said
jim
gazing
at
the
astonished
miss
evans
was
afraid
of
getting
me
into
trouble
said
carter
i
just
gave
her
a
wink
not
to
recognize
me
but
she
knew
me
well
enough
bless
dare
you
said
the
girl
starting
up
i
never
seen
you
before
in
my
right
nan
said
the
brazen
carter
it
no
good
keeping
it
up
now
i
come
back
to
act
fair
and
miss
evans
struggled
for
breath
he
is
my
girl
said
her
father
patting
her
on
the
back
not
much
to
look
at
and
he
treated
you
very
shabby
but
if
you
want
him
i
suppose
you
must
have
him
repeated
the
incensed
miss
evans
him
i
tell
you
not
bert
how
dare
he
come
here
and
call
me
nan
used
not
to
mind
it
said
carter
plaintively
tell
you
said
miss
evans
turning
to
her
father
and
brother
not
bert
do
you
think
i
do
know
he
ought
to
know
who
he
is
said
her
father
reasonably
course
i
ought
said
carter
smiling
at
her
what
reason
should
i
have
for
saying
i
am
bert
if
i
am
not
a
fair
question
said
jim
as
the
girl
bit
her
lip
should
he
him
said
the
girl
tartly
here
my
girl
said
evans
in
ominous
accents
four
years
you
been
grieving
over
bert
and
me
and
jim
have
been
hunting
high
and
low
for
him
we
got
him
at
last
and
now
you
got
to
have
he
do
run
away
again
said
jim
would
trust
him
farther
than
i
could
see
evans
sat
and
glowered
at
his
prospective
as
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
developed
themselves
even
reminders
that
he
had
come
back
and
surrendered
of
his
own
free
will
failed
to
move
him
and
he
was
hesitating
between
tying
him
up
and
locking
him
in
the
attic
and
hiring
a
man
to
watch
him
when
carter
himself
suggested
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
lodge
with
you
he
said
i
give
you
all
my
money
and
things
to
take
care
of
i
ca
run
away
without
he
turned
out
his
pockets
on
the
table
seven
pounds
eighteen
shillings
and
fourpence
with
his
return
ticket
made
one
heap
his
watch
and
chain
penknife
and
a
few
other
accessories
another
a
suggestion
of
jim
that
he
should
add
his
boots
was
vetoed
by
the
elder
man
as
unnecessary
you
are
said
evans
sweeping
the
things
into
his
own
pockets
the
day
you
are
married
i
hand
them
back
to
his
temper
improved
as
the
evening
wore
on
by
the
time
supper
was
finished
and
his
pipe
alight
he
became
almost
jocular
and
the
coldness
of
miss
evans
was
the
only
drawback
to
an
otherwise
enjoyable
evening
showing
off
a
little
temper
said
her
father
after
she
had
withdrawn
wants
to
show
she
ai
going
to
forgive
you
too
easy
not
but
what
you
behaved
badly
however
let
bygones
be
bygones
my
the
behavior
of
miss
evans
was
so
much
better
next
day
that
it
really
seemed
as
though
her
father
diagnosis
was
correct
at
dinner
when
the
men
came
home
from
work
she
piled
carter
plate
up
so
generously
that
her
father
and
brother
had
ample
time
at
their
disposal
to
watch
him
eat
and
when
he
put
his
hand
over
his
glass
she
poured
half
a
pint
of
good
beer
that
other
men
would
have
been
thankful
for
up
his
sleeve
piled
carter
plate
up
so
generously
that
her
father
and
brother
had
ample
time
at
their
disposal
to
watch
him
eat
she
was
out
all
the
afternoon
but
at
tea
time
she
sat
next
to
carter
and
joined
brightly
in
the
conversation
concerning
her
marriage
she
addressed
him
as
bert
and
when
he
furtively
pressed
her
hand
beneath
the
she
made
no
attempt
to
withdraw
it
ca
think
how
it
was
you
did
know
him
at
first
said
her
father
usually
of
me
said
nancy
i
am
silly
carter
pressed
her
hand
again
and
gazing
tenderly
into
her
eyes
received
a
glance
in
return
which
set
him
thinking
it
was
too
cold
and
calculating
for
real
affection
in
fact
after
another
glance
he
began
to
doubt
if
it
indicated
affection
at
all
like
old
times
bert
said
miss
evans
with
an
odd
smile
you
remember
what
you
said
that
afternoon
when
i
put
the
hot
spoon
on
your
neck
was
the
reply
was
it
inquired
the
girl
wo
repeat
it
said
carter
firmly
he
was
reminded
of
other
episodes
during
the
meal
but
by
the
exercise
of
tact
and
the
plea
of
a
bad
memory
did
fairly
well
he
felt
that
he
had
done
very
well
indeed
when
having
cleared
the
away
nancy
came
and
sat
beside
him
with
her
hand
in
his
her
brother
grunted
but
evans
in
whom
a
vein
of
sentiment
still
lingered
watched
them
with
much
satisfaction
carter
had
got
possession
of
both
hands
and
was
murmuring
fulsome
flatteries
when
the
sound
of
somebody
pausing
at
the
open
door
caused
them
to
be
hastily
withdrawn
evans
said
a
young
man
putting
his
head
in
halloa
bert
well
of
all
said
carter
with
attempted
enthusiasm
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
thought
you
was
lost
said
the
other
stepping
in
and
gripping
his
hand
never
thought
i
was
going
to
set
eyes
on
you
again
well

is
a
surprise

wilson

i
have

said
carter

known

he
shook
hands
effusively
and
wilson
after
a
little
pretended
hesitation
accepted
a
chair
and
began
to
talk
about
old
times
lay
you
ai
forgot
one
thing
bert
he
said
at
last
that
inquired
the
other
i
lent

said
wilson
carter
after
the
first
shock
of
surprise
pretended
to
think
wilson
supplying
him
with
details
as
to
time
and
place
which
he
was
in
no
position
to
dispute
he
turned
to
evans
who
was
still
acting
as
his
banker
and
after
a
little
hesitation
requested
him
to
pay
the
money
conversation
seemed
to
fail
somewhat
after
that
and
wilson
during
an
awkward
pause
went
off
whistling
old
joe
said
carter
lightly
after
he
had
gone
altered
a
miss
evans
glanced
at
him
but
said
nothing
she
was
looking
instead
towards
a
gentleman
of
middle
age
who
was
peeping
round
the
door
indulging
in
a
waggish
game
of
with
the
unconscious
carter
finding
that
he
had
at
last
attracted
his
attention
the
gentleman
came
inside
and
breathing
somewhat
heavily
after
his
exertions
stood
before
him
with
outstretched
hand
gentleman
of
middle
age
was
peeping
round
the
door
goes
it
said
carter
forcing
a
smile
and
shaking
hands
grown
than
ever
said
the
gentleman
subsiding
into
a
chair
have

said
carter
should
hardly
have
known

the
other
in

more
subdued
fashion

glad
to
see

wedding
cake

bit

carter
quickly
prout
got
up
and
shook
hands
with
him
again
only
shows
what
mistakes
a
man
can
make
he
said
resuming
his
seat
only
shows
how
easy
it
is
to
misjudge
one
when
you
went
away
sudden
four
years
ago
i
says
to
myself
prout
i
says
up
your
mind
to
it
that
two
quid
has
gorn
the
smile
vanished
from
carter
face
and
a
sudden
chill
descended
upon
the
company
quid
he
said
stiffly
two
quid
two
quid
i
lent
you
said
prout
in
a
pained
voice
said
carter
struggling
you
and
i
met
him
that
evening
on
the
pier
said
miss
evans
in
a
voice
carter
started
and
gazed
at
her
uneasily
the
smile
on
her
lip
and
the
triumphant
gleam
in
her
eye
were
a
revelation
to
him
he
turned
to
evans
and
in
as
calm
a
voice
as
he
could
assume
requested
him
to
discharge
the
debt
prout
his
fingers
twitching
stood
waiting
it
your
money
said
evans
grudgingly
extracting
a
purse
from
his
i
suppose
you
ought
to
pay
your
debts
he
put
down
two
pounds
on
the
table
and
broke
off
in
sudden
amazement
as
prout
snatching
up
the
money
bolted
headlong
from
the
room
his
surprise
was
shared
by
his
son
but
the
other
two
made
no
sign
carter
was
now
prepared
for
the
worst
and
his
voice
was
quite
calm
as
he
gave
instructions
for
the
payment
of
the
other
three
gentlemen
who
presented
claims
during
the
evening
endorsed
by
miss
evans
as
the
last
departed
evans
whose
temper
had
been
gradually
getting
beyond
his
control
crossed
over
and
handed
him
his
watch
and
chain
a
few
coppers
and
the
return
half
of
his
railway
ticket

said
breathing
thickly
no
doubt

over
england

cadger

he
pointed
to
the
door
and
carter
after
twice
opening
his
lips
to
speak
and
failing
blundered
towards
it
miss
evans
watched
him
curiously
never
prosper
she
said
with
gentle
severity
said
carter
pausing
at
the
door
your
own
fault
continued
miss
evans
who
was
suffering
from
a
slight
touch
of
conscience
you
had
come
here
pretending
to
be
bert
simmons
and
calling
me
as
if
you

carter

nancy

nancy
was
done
just
to
punish
evans

a
strange
cry

towards
the
door
have
that
money
out
of
he
roared
i
have
to
hold
up
and
shake
it
out
of
their
you
stay
he
hurried
up
the
road
and
jim
with
the
set
face
of
a
man
going
into
action
against
heavy
odds
followed
him
father
told
me
to
stay
said
carter
coming
farther
into
the
room
nancy
looked
up
at
him
through
her
eyelashes
need
not
unless
you
want
to
she
said
very
softly
keeping
up
appearances
is
superstitious
said
the
as
he
gave
utterance
to
a
series
of
chirruping
endearments
to
a
black
cat
with
one
eye
that
had
just
been
using
a
leg
of
his
trousers
as
a
serviette
that
cat
stole
some
men
suppers
they
have
acted
foolish
and
suffered
for
it
all
the
rest
of
their
he
scratched
the
cat
behind
the
ear
and
despite
himself
his
face
darkened
it
over
the
side
they
would
he
said
longingly
chucked
bits
o
coke
at
it
till
it
sank
as
i
said
afore
everybody
is
superstitious
and
those
that
ai
ought
to
be
for
a
cure
i
knew
one
man
that
killed
a
black
cat
and
arter
that
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
could
never
get
three
sheets
in
the
wind
without
seeing
its
ghost
spoilt
his
life
for
it
he
scratched
the
cat
other
ear
only
left
it
a
moment
while
i
went
round
to
the
bull
head
he
said
slowly
filling
his
pipe
i
thought
i
put
it
out
o
reach
some
his
fingers
twined
round
the
animal
neck
then
with
a
sigh
he
rose
and
took
a
turn
or
two
on
the
jetty
superstitiousness
is
right
and
proper
to
a
certain
extent
he
said
resuming
his
seat
but
o
course
like
everything
else
some
people
carry
it
too
believe
anything
they
are
and
if
you
in
no
hurry
i
can
tell
you
a
tale
of
a
pal
o
mine
bill
burtenshaw
by
name
that
prove
my
words
is
right
and
proper
to
a
certain
extent
his
mother
was
superstitious
afore
and
always
knew
when
friends
died
by
hearing
three
loud
taps
on
the
wall
the
mistake
she
ever
made
was
one
night
when
arter
losing
no
less
than
seven
friends
she
found
out
it
was
the
man
next
door
hanging
pictures
at
three
in
the
morning
she
found
it
out
by
hitting
for
the
first
few
years
arter
he
grew
up
bill
went
to
sea
and
that
made
more
superstitious
than
ever
him
and
a
pal
named
silas
winch
went
several
together
and
their
talk
used
to
be
that
creepy
that
some
o
the
chaps
was
afraid
to
be
left
on
deck
alone
of
a
night
silas
was
a
miserable
sort
o
chap
always
looking
on
the
black
side
o
things
and
shaking
his
over
it
he
thought
nothing
o
seeing
ghosts
and
pore
old
ben
huggins
slept
on
the
floor
for
a
week
by
reason
of
a
ghost
with
its
throat
cut
that
silas
saw
in
his
bunk
he
gave
silas
arf
a
dollar
and
a
to
change
bunks
with
when
bill
burtenshaw
left
the
sea
and
got
married
he
lost
sight
of
silas
altogether
and
the
thing
he
to
remind
him
of
was
a
piece
o
paper
which
they
both
signed
with
their
blood
promising
that
the
fust
one
that
died
would
appear
to
the
other
bill
agreed
to
it
one
evenin
when
he
did
know
wot
he
was
doing
and
for
years
arterwards
used
to
get
the
cold
creeps
down
back
when
he
thought
of
silas
dying
fust
and
the
idea
of
dying
fust
gave
cold
creeps
all
over
bill
was
a
very
good
husband
when
he
was
sober
but
money
was
two
pounds
a
week
and
when
a
man
has
all
that
and
a
wife
to
keep
out
of
it
it
natural
for
to
drink
burtenshaw
tried
all
sorts
ways
and
means
of
curing
but
it
was
no
use
bill
used
to
think
ways
too
knowing
the
the
drink
was
doing
and
his
plan
was
for
missis
to
empty
a
bucket
o
cold
water
over
every
time
he
came
the
worse
for
licker
she
did
it
once
but
as
she
to
spend
the
rest
o
the
night
in
the
back
yard
it
was
tried
again
bill
got
worse
as
he
got
older
and
even
made
away
with
the
furniture
to
get
drink
with
and
then
he
used
to
tell
missis
that
he
was
drove
to
the
pub
because
his
was
so
uncomfortable
just
at
that
time
things
was
at
their
worst
silas
winch
who
to
be
ashore
and
got
bill
address
from
a
pal
called
to
see
it
was
a
saturday
arternoon
when
he
called
and
o
course
bill
was
out
but
missis
showed
him
in
and
arter
fetching
another
chair
from
the
kitchen
asked
to
sit
down
silas
was
very
perlite
at
fust
but
arter
looking
round
the
room
and
seeing
bare
it
was
he
gave
a
little
cough
and
he
ses
thought
bill
was
doing
well
he
ses
was
very
perlite
at
fust
he
is
ses
burtenshaw
silas
winch
coughed
again
suppose
he
likes
room
to
stretch
about
in
he
ses
looking
round
burtenshaw
wiped
eyes
and
then
knowing
silas
had
been
an
old
friend
o
bill
she
drew
chair
a
bit
closer
and
told
him
it
was
better
when
he
sober
you
could
wish
to
see
she
ses
wiping
her
eyes
agin
give
me
he
silas
face
got
longer
than
ever
a
matter
o
fact
he
ses
a
bit
down
on
my
luck
and
i
called
round
with
the
that
bill
could
lend
me
a
bit
just
till
i
can
pull
burtenshaw
shook
her
i
i
can
stay
and
see
ses
silas
and
used
to
be
great
pals
at
one
time
and
many
the
good
turn
i
done
him
wot
time
he
be
time
after
twelve
ses
burtenshaw
you
better
not
be
here
then
you
see
being
in
that
condition
he
might
think
you
was
your
own
ghost
come
according
to
promise
and
be
frightened
out
of
life
he
often
talked
about
silas
winch
scratched
his
head
and
looked
at
should
he
mistake
me
for
a
ghost
he
ses
at
last
shock
might
do
good
and
if
you
come
to
that
why
should
i
pretend
to
be
my
own
ghost
and
warn
off
the
drink
burtenshaw
got
so
excited
at
the
idea
she
could
speak
but
at
last
arter
saying
over
and
over
agin
she
would
do
such
a
thing
for
worlds
she
and
silas
arranged
that
he
should
come
in
at
about
three
in
the
morning
and
give
bill
a
solemn
warning
she
gave
her
key
and
silas
said
he
come
in
with
his
and
cap
all
wet
and
pretend
he
been
drowned
very
kind
of
you
to
take
all
this
trouble
for
nothing
ses
burtenshaw
as
silas
got
up
to
go
mention
it
ses
silas
ai
the
fust
time
and
i
suppose
it
be
the
last
that
i
put
myself
out
to
help
my
we
all
ought
to
do
wot
we
can
for
each
if
he
finds
it
out
ses
burtenshaw
all
of
a
tremble
do
know
nothing
about
it
to
make
it
more
better
pretend
not
to
see
it
would
be
better
ses
silas
stopping
at
the
street
door
i
ask
is
that
you
the
poker
and
anything
else
that
might
be
laying
about
handy
and
you
better
oil
the
lock
so
as
the
key
make
a
burtenshaw
shut
the
door
arter
and
then
she
went
in
and
a
quiet
all
by
to
think
it
over
the
only
thing
that
comforted
was
that
bill
would
be
in
licker
and
also
that
would
believe
anything
in
the
ghost
line
it
was
past
twelve
when
a
couple
o
pals
brought
him
and
arter
offering
to
fight
all
six
of
one
after
the
other
bill
hit
the
wall
for
getting
in
way
and
tumbled
upstairs
to
bed
in
less
than
ten
minutes
was
fast
asleep
and
pore
burtenshaw
arter
trying
her
best
to
keep
awake
fell
asleep
too
she
was
woke
up
suddenly
by
a
noise
that
froze
the
marrer
in
the
most
groan
she
ever
heard
in
life
and
raising
her
she
saw
silas
winch
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
he
done
his
face
and
hands
over
with
wot
is
called
loominous
paint
his
cap
was
pushed
at
the
back
of
his
and
wet
wisps
of
was
hanging
over
his
eyes
for
a
moment
burtenshaw
stood
still
and
then
silas
let
off
another
groan
that
put
her
on
edge
all
over
it
was
a
groan
that
seemed
to
come
from
nothing
until
it
spread
into
a
roar
that
made
the
room
tremble
and
rattled
the
jug
in
the
basin
it
shook
everything
in
the
room
but
bill
and
he
went
on
sleeping
like
an
infant
silas
did
two
more
groans
and
then
leaned
over
the
foot
o
the
bed
and
stared
at
bill
as
though
could
believe
his
eyesight
saw
silas
winch
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
a
squeaky
one
ses
burtenshaw
silas
tried
five
squeaky
ones
and
then
he
a
fit
o
coughing
that
would
ha
woke
the
dead
as
they
say
but
it
did
wake
bill
some
more
deep
ones
ses
burtenshaw
in
a
silas
licked
his
the
tried
the
deep
ones
agin
mix
a
bit
ses
burtenshaw
silas
stared
at
her
he
ses
very
short
you
think
a
or
wot
he
stood
there
sulky
for
a
moment
and
then
invented
a
noise
that
nothing
living
could
miss
hearing
even
bill
could
he
moved
in
sleep
and
arter
silas
done
it
twice
more
he
turned
and
spoke
to
missis
about
it
d
hear
he
ses
it
stop
it
at
burtenshaw
pretended
to
be
asleep
and
bill
was
just
going
to
turn
over
agin
when
silas
let
off
another
groan
it
was
a
little
one
this
time
but
bill
sat
up
as
though
he
been
shot
and
he
no
sooner
caught
sight
of
silas
standing
there
than
gave
a
dreadful
and
rolling
over
wropped
up
in
all
the
could
lay
his
on
then
burtenshaw
gave
a
and
tried
to
get
some
of
back
but
bill
thinking
it
was
the
ghost
only
held
on
tighter
than
ever
ses
silas
winch
in
an
awful
voice
bill
gave
a
kick
and
tried

said
and
arter

long
silence
he
ventured
to
put
an
eye
over

edge
of

discovered
that

ghost
gone
he
lay
awake
for
a

o
hours
wondering
and
saying
over
the
address
to
himself
so
that

should
forget
it
and
just
afore
it
was
time
to
get
up
he
fell
into
a
peaceful
slumber
his

wondering
she
was
to
alter

told
all
about

in
the
morning

in

little
barrel
o

a
thirst
that

arter
a
