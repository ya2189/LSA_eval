the
riverman
by

edward
white
i
the
time
was
the
year
and
the
place
a
bend
in
the
river
above
a
long
pond
terminating
in
a
dam
beyond
this
dam
and
on
a
flat
lower
than
it
stood
a
mill
structure
save
for
a
small
clearing
and
the
road
that
led
from
it
all
else
was
forest
here
in
the
following
the
course
of
the
stream
the
hardwoods
grew
dense
their
uppermost
branches
just
beginning
to
spray
out
in
the
first
green
of
spring
farther
back
where
the
higher
lands
arose
from
the
swamp
could
be
discerned
the
graceful
frond
of
white
pines
and
hemlock
and
the
sturdy
tops
of
norways
and
spruce
a
strong
wind
blew
up
the
length
of
the
pond
it
ruffled
the
surface
of
the
water
swooping
down
in
scurrying
turning
the
surface
as
one
turns
the
nap
of
velvet
at
the
upper
end
of
the
pond
it
even
succeeded
in
raising
quite
respectable
wavelets
which
lap
lap
lapped
eagerly
against
a
barrier
of
floating
logs
that
filled
completely
the
mouth
of
the
inlet
river
and
behind
this
barrier
were
other
logs
and
yet
others
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
so
that
the
entire
surface
of
the
stream
was
carpeted
by
the
brown
timbers
a
man
could
have
walked
down
the
middle
of
that
river
as
down
a
highway
on
the
bank
and
in
a
small
burned
two
fires
their
smoke
ducking
and
twisting
under
the
buffeting
of
the
wind
the
first
of
these
fires
occupied
a
shallow
trench
dug
for
its
accommodation
and
was
overarched
by
a
rustic
framework
from
which
hung
several
pails
kettles
and
pots
an
chubby
man
in
a
battered
brown
derby
hat
moved
here
and
there
he
divided
his
time
between
the
utensils
and
an
indifferent
youth
his
the
other
and
larger
fire
centred
a
rectangle
composed
of
tall
racks
built
of
saplings
and
intended
for
the
drying
of
clothes
two
large
tents
gleamed
white
among
the
trees
about
the
were
gathered
men
some
were
before
the
blaze
others
sat
in
rows
on
logs
drawn
close
for
the
purpose
still
others
squatted
like
indians
on
their
heels
their
hands
thrown
forward
to
keep
the
balance
nearly
all
were
smoking
pipes
every
age
was
represented
in
this
group
but
young
men
predominated
all
wore
woollen
trousers
stuffed
into
leather
boots
reaching
just
to
the
knee
these
boots
were
armed
on
the
soles
with
rows
of
formidable
sharp
spikes
or
caulks
a
half
and
sometimes
even
three
quarters
of
an
inch
in
length
the
tight
driver
shoe
and
trousers
had
not
then
come
into
use
from
the
waist
down
these
men
wore
all
alike
as
though
in
a
uniform
the
outward
symbol
of
their
calling
from
the
waist
up
was
more
latitude
of
personal
taste
one
young
fellow
sported
a
mackinaw
blanket
jacket
another
wore
a
red
knit
sash
with
tasselled
ends
a
third
fancy
ran
to
a
bright
bandana
about
his
neck
too
covered
wide
variations
of
broader
or
narrower
brim
of
higher
or
lower
crown
and
the
faces
beneath
those
hats
differed
as
everywhere
the
human
countenance
differs
only
when
the
inspection
passing
the
gradations
of
broad
or
narrow
thick
or
thin
bony
or
rounded
rested
finally
on
the
eyes
would
the
observer
have
caught
again
the
which
stamped
these
men
as
belonging
to
a
distinct
order
and
separated
them
essentially
from
other
men
in
other
occupations
blue
and
brown
and
black
and
gray
these
eyes
were
but
all
steady
and
clear
with
the
steadiness
and
clarity
that
comes
to
those
whose
daily
work
compels
them
under
penalty
to
pay
close
and
undeviating
attention
to
their
surroundings
this
is
true
of
sailors
hunters
plainsmen
cowboys
and
tugboat
captains
it
was
especially
true
of
the
for
a
misstep
a
miscalculation
a
moment
forgetfulness
of
the
sullen
forces
shifting
and
changing
about
him
could
mean
for
him
maiming
or
destruction
so
finally
to
one
of
an
imaginative
bent
these
eyes
like
the
boots
grew
to
seem
part
of
the
uniform
one
of
the
marks
of
their
caste
the
outward
symbol
of
their
calling
you
son
of
a
gun
cried
disgustedly
one
young
fellow
with
a
red
bandana
apostrophising
the
wind
wonder
if
there
any
side
of
this
fire
that
ai
smoky
your
hair
on
bub
advised
a
calm
and
grizzled
never
no
smoke
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
whichever
that
happens
to
be
and
as
for
wind
she
just
makes
holiday
for
the
hell
snorted
the
younger
man
ought
to
be
down
to
dam
before
now
bull
dam
is
to
redding
mocked
a
reptilian
and
giant
on
the
log
redding
is
the
happy
childhood
home
of
the
young
man
leaped
to
his
feet
and
seized
from
a
pile
of
tools
a
peavy
a
dangerous
weapon
like
a
heavy
but
armed
at
the
end
with
a
sharp
steel
shoe
about
enough
he
warned
raising
his
weapon
his
face
suffused
and
angry
the
man
quite
unafraid
rose
slowly
from
the
log
and
advanced
his
small
eyes
narrowed
and
watchful
but
immediately
a
dozen
men
interfered
up
advised
the
grizzled
tom
north
by
name
purdy
set
down
and
you
young
squirt
subside
if
you
going
to
have
ructions
why
have
but
not
on
drive
if
you
do
look
out
set
you
both
to
rustling
wood
for
the
at
this
threat
the
belligerents
dropped
muttering
to
their
places
the
wind
continued
to
blow
the
fire
continued
to
flare
up
and
down
the
men
continued
to
smoke
exchanging
from
time
to
time
desultory
and
aimless
remarks
only
tom
north
carried
on
a
consecutive
conversation
with
another
of
about
his
own
age
the
same
jim
he
was
saying
is
a
little
tough
on
the
boys
this
new
business
they
been
sort
of
expectin
a
chance
for
a
day
or
two
at
redding
and
now
if
this
son
of
a
gun
of
a
wind
hangs
out
i
do
know
when
we
make
her
the
shallows
at
was
always
bad
enough
but
this
is
i
expected
to
pick
you
up
below
admitted
jim
whose
or
at
his
side
proclaimed
him
a
newcomer
quite
a
tramp
to
find
stretch
of
slack
water
was
always
a
terror
went
on
north
we
had
fairly
to
every
stick
through
when
the
wind
blew
but
now
that
dam
backed
the
water
up
until
there
reely
ai
no
current
at
all
and
this
breeze
has
just
stopped
the
drive
dead
as
a
opening
the
give
her
a
draw
inquired
the
newcomer
against
this
wind
and
not
much
of
a
draw
anyway
i
should
long
you
been
hung
i
expect
jack
will
be
down
from
the
rear
shortly
ought
to
see
something
wrong
when
he
runs
against
the
tail
of
this
jam
of
at
this
moment
the
lugubrious
man
in
the
derby
hat
stepped
aside
from
the
row
of
steaming
utensils
he
had
been
arranging
pile
he
remarked
in
a
conversational
tone
of
voice
the
group
arose
as
one
man
and
moved
upon
the
heap
of
cutlery
and
of
tin
plates
and
cups
from
the
open
lard
pails
and
kettles
they
helped
themselves
liberally
then
retired
to
squat
in
little
groups
here
and
there
near
the
sources
of
supply
mere
conversation
yielded
to
an
industrious
silence
sadly
the
cook
surveyed
the
scene
his
arms
folded
across
the
dirty
white
apron
an
immense
mental
reservation
accenting
the
melancholy
of
his
countenance
after
some
moments
of
contemplation
he
mixed
a
fizzling
concoction
of
vinegar
and
soda
which
he
drank
his
rotundity
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
he
was
ravaged
by
a
gnawing
dyspepsia
and
the
sight
of
six
eggs
eaten
as
a
side
dish
to
substantials
carried
consternation
to
his
interior
so
busily
engaged
was
each
after
his
own
fashion
that
nobody
observed
the
approach
of
a
solitary
figure
down
the
highway
of
the
river
the
man
appeared
tiny
around
the
upper
bend
momently
growing
larger
as
he
approached
his
progress
was
jerky
and
on
an
uneven
zigzag
according
as
the
logs
lay
by
leaps
short
runs
brief
pauses
as
a
riverman
goes
finally
he
stepped
ashore
just
below
the
camp
stamped
his
feet
vigorously
free
of
water
and
approached
the
group
around
the
no
one
saw
him
save
the
cook
who
vouchsafed
him
a
stately
and
lugubrious
inclination
of
the
head
the
newcomer
was
a
man
somewhere
about
thirty
years
of
age
squarely
built
big
of
bone
compact
in
bulk
his
face
was
burly
jolly
and
reddened
rather
than
tanned
by
long
exposure
a
pair
of
twinkling
blue
eyes
and
a
humorously
quirked
mouth
redeemed
his
countenance
from
commonplaceness
he
spread
his
feet
apart
and
surveyed
the
scene
boys
he
remarked
at
last
in
a
rollicking
big
voice
glad
to
see
the
situation
has
spoiled
your
at
this
they
looked
up
with
a
spontaneous
answering
grin
tom
north
laid
aside
his
plate
and
started
to
arise
still
tom
interposed
the
newcomer
hearty
i
going
to
feed
yet
myself
then
we
see
what
to
be
done
i
think
first
thing
you
better
see
to
having
this
wind
turned
after
the
meal
was
finished
north
and
his
principal
sauntered
to
the
water
edge
where
they
stood
for
a
minute
looking
at
the
logs
and
the
ruffled
expanse
of
water
below
as
well
have
sails
on
them
and
be
done
with
it
remarked
jack
orde
reflectively
hold
any
tighter
it
a
pity
that
old
mossback
had
to
put
in
a
mill
the
water
was
slack
enough
before
but
now
there
seems
to
be
no
current
at
of
wait
for
the
wind
agreed
tom
north
daly
will
be
he
must
be
about
out
of
logs
at
the
mill
the
going
down
every
minute
and
it
make
the
riffles
above
redding
a
holy
fright
and
i
expect
johnson
drive
will
be
down
on
our
rear
most
any
there
already
let
go
take
a
look
suggested
orde
they
picked
their
way
around
the
edge
of
the
pond
to
the
site
of
the
new
mill
open
all
right
commented
orde
she
might
be
saw
to
that
rejoined
north
in
an
injured
tone
agreed
orde
he
might
have
dropped
her
shut
on
you
between
times
when
you
were
he
walked
out
on
the
structure
and
looked
down
on
the
smooth
water
rushing
through
to
make
a
draw
he
reflected
then
he
laughed
look
here
he
called
down
and
take
a
squint
at
north
clambered
to
a
position
below
son
of
a
gun
he
exclaimed
the
sluice
instead
of
bedding
at
the
natural
channel
of
the
river
had
been
built
a
good
six
feet
above
that
level
so
that
even
with
the
gates
wide
open
a
of
six
feet
was
retained
in
the
slack
water
of
the
pond
wonder
we
could
get
a
draw
said
orde
hunt
up
old
and
have
a
name
is
plain
reed
explained
north
he
comes
cats
cried
orde
with
one
of
his
big
rollicking
chuckles
did
you
catch
it
the
owner
of
the
dam
flapped
into
view
as
a
lank
and
lengthy
individual
dressed
in
loose
long
clothes
and
wearing
a
battered
old
hat
the
nap
of
which
seemed
all
to
have
been
rubbed
off
the
wrong
way
as
he
bore
down
on
the
intruders
with
tremendous
nervous
strides
they
perceived
him
to
be
an
old
man
white
of
hair
cadaverous
of
countenance
with
thin
straight
lips
and
burning
fanatic
eyes
beneath
stiff
and
bushy
brows
reed
shouted
orde
above
the
noise
of
the
water
gentlemen
replied
the
apparition
dam
you
got
here
went
on
orde
reed
nodded
his
fiery
eyes
fixed
unblinking
on
the
riverman
you
have
been
quite
square
to
us
said
orde
are
giving
us
much
show
to
get
our
logs
so
snapped
the
owner
his
thin
lips
tightening
i
guess
you
know
all
right
laughed
orde
clambering
leisurely
back
to
the
top
of
the
dam
sluice
is
a
good
six
foot
too
that
so
cried
the
old
man
plunging
suddenly
into
a
craze
of
excitement
let
me
tell
you
this
man
i
giving
you
all
the
law
gives
you
and
that
the
natural
flow
of
the
river
and
not
a
thing
more
will
you
get
you
that
comes
to
waste
and
destroy
to
arrogate
unto
yourselves
the
kingdoms
of
the
yearth
and
all
the
fruits
thereof
let
me
tell
you
you
ca
override
simeon
reed
i
engaged
here
in
a
peaceful
and
fittin
operation
which
is
to
feed
the
hungry
by
means
of
this
not
to
rampage
and
bring
destruction
to
the
noble
forests
god
has
planted
i
give
you
what
the
law
gives
you
and
more
somewhat
astonished
at
this
outbreak
the
two
rivermen
stood
for
a
moment
staring
at
the
old
man
then
a
steely
glint
crept
into
frank
blue
eye
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
tightened
want
no
trouble
with
you
reed
said
he
i
no
lawyer
to
know
what
the
law
requires
you
to
do
and
what
it
requires
you
not
to
do
but
i
do
know
that
this
is
the
only
dam
on
the
river
with
sluices
built
up
that
way
and
i
do
know
that
we
never
get
those
logs
out
if
we
do
get
more
draw
on
the
water
followed
by
the
reluctant
north
he
walked
away
leaving
the
gaunt
figure
of
the
dam
owner
gazing
after
them
his
black
garments
flapping
about
him
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
his
ruffled
plug
hat
thrust
from
his
forehead
burst
out
north
when
they
were
out
of
hearing
mimicked
orde
with
a
laugh
you
going
to
let
that
old
walk
all
over
you
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
tom
it
his
do
know
but
you
ai
going
to
let
him
bang
us
up
here
all
summer
not
but
the
wind
shifting
let
see
what
the
weather
like
pretty
ii
the
next
morning
dawned
clear
and
breathless
before
daylight
the
pessimistic
cook
was
out
his
fire
winking
bravely
against
the
darkness
his
only
satisfaction
of
the
long
day
came
when
he
aroused
the
men
from
the
heavy
sleep
into
which
daily
toil
plunged
them
with
the
first
light
the
entire
crew
were
at
the
banks
of
the
river
as
soon
as
the
wind
died
the
logs
had
begun
to
drift
slowly
out
into
the
open
water
the
surface
of
the
pond
was
covered
with
the
scattered
timbers
floating
idly
after
a
few
moments
the
clank
of
the
bars
and
ratchet
was
heard
as
two
of
the
men
raised
the
heavy
on
the
dam
a
roar
of
water
momently
increasing
marked
the
slow
rise
of
the
barrier
a
very
imaginative
man
might
then
have
made
out
a
tendency
forward
on
the
part
of
those
timbers
floating
nearest
the
centre
of
the
pond
it
was
a
very
sluggish
tendency
however
and
the
men
watching
critically
shook
their
heads
four
more
had
by
this
time
joined
the
two
men
who
had
raised
the
gate
and
all
together
armed
with
long
pike
poles
walked
out
on
the
booms
that
should
concentrate
the
logs
into
the
chute
here
they
prodded
forward
the
few
timbers
within
reach
and
waited
for
more
these
were
a
long
time
coming
members
of
the
driving
crew
leaped
shouting
from
one
log
to
another
sometimes
when
the
space
across
was
too
wide
to
jump
they
propelled
a
log
over
either
by
rolling
it
paddling
it
or
projecting
it
by
the
shock
of
a
leap
on
one
end
in
accomplishing
these
feats
of
balance
they
stood
upright
and
graceful
quite
unconscious
of
themselves
their
bodies
accustomed
by
long
habit
to
nice
and
instant
obedience
to
the
almost
unconscious
impulses
of
the
brain
only
their
eyes
intent
preoccupied
blazed
out
by
sheer
the
unstable
path
their
owners
should
follow
once
at
the
forefront
of
the
drive
the
men
began
vigorously
to
urge
the
logs
forward
this
they
accomplished
almost
entirely
by
main
strength
for
the
sluggish
current
gave
them
little
aid
under
the
pressure
of
their
feet
as
they
pushed
against
their
implements
the
logs
dipped
rolled
and
plunged
nevertheless
they
worked
as
surely
from
the
decks
of
these
unstable
craft
as
from
the
solid
earth
itself
in
this
manner
the
logs
in
the
centre
of
the
pond
were
urged
forward
until
above
the
chute
they
caught
the
slightly
accelerated
current
which
should
bring
them
down
to
the
men
at
the
dam
immediately
when
this
stronger
influence
was
felt
the
drivers
zigzagged
back
up
stream
to
start
a
fresh
batch
in
the
meantime
a
great
many
logs
drifted
away
to
right
and
left
into
stagnant
water
where
they
lay
absolutely
motionless
the
moving
of
them
was
deferred
for
the
crew
which
would
bring
up
the
rear
jack
orde
wandered
back
and
forth
over
the
work
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
a
short
pipe
clenched
between
his
teeth
to
the
edge
of
the
drive
he
rode
the
logs
then
took
to
the
bank
and
strolled
down
to
the
dam
there
he
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
aimlessly
at
the
water
making
over
the
apron
after
which
he
returned
to
the
work
no
cloud
obscured
the
serene
of
his
face
meeting
tom
troubled
glance
he
grinned
broadly
you
we
have
johnson
on
our
necks
he
remarked
jerking
his
thumb
up
river
toward
a
rapidly
approaching
figure
this
soon
defined
itself
as
a
tall
very
blond
individual
with
a
choleric
blue
eye
in
hell
the
matter
here
he
yelled
as
soon
as
he
came
within
hearing
distance
orde
made
no
reply
but
stood
contemplating
the
newcomer
with
a
flicker
of
amusement
in
hell
the
matter
repeated
the
latter
violently
go
there
and
inquire
rejoined
orde
drolly
ails

as

logs

any
faster

down
and
do
it
johnson
vouchsafed
no
reply
but
splashed
away
over
the
logs
examining
in
detail
the
progress
of
the
work
after
a
little
he
returned
within
hailing
distance
you
ca
get
out
logs
why
do
you
take
the
job
he
roared
with
a
string
of
oaths
you
hang
my
drive
damn
you
you
catch
it
for
damages
it
gettin
to
a
purty
pass
when
any
old
highbanker
from
anywheres

get
out
and
play
jackstraws
holdin
up
every
drive
in
the
river
i
tell
you
our
mills
need
logs
and
what
more
they
agoin
to
git
them
he
departed
in
a
rumble
of
vituperation
orde
laughed
humorously
at
his
foreman
gets
so
mad
sometimes
his
skin
cracks
he
remarked
he
went
on
more
seriously
a
heap
in
what
he
means
if
there
ai
so
much
in
what
he
says
i
go
labour
with
our
old
friend
he
regained
the
bank
stopped
to
light
his
pipe
and
sauntered
with
every
appearance
of
leisure
down
the
bank
past
the
dam
to
the
mill
structure
below
here
he
found
the
owner
occupying
a
chair
tilted
back
against
the
wall
of
the
building
his
ruffled
plug
hat
was
thrust
as
usual
well
away
from
his
high
and
narrow
forehead
the
long
broadcloth
coat
fell
back
to
reveal
an
unbuttoned
waistcoat
the
flapping
black
trousers
were
hitched
up
far
enough
to
display
woollen
socks
wrinkled
about
bony
shanks
he
was
whittling
a
pine
stick
which
he
held
pointing
down
between
his
spread
knees
and
conversing
animatedly
with
a
young
fellow
occupying
another
chair
at
his
side
there
comes
one
of
now
declaimed
the
old
man
dramatically
orde
nodded
briefly
to
the
stranger
and
came
at
once
to
business
want
to
talk
this
matter
over
with
you
he
began
are
making
much
progress
we
ca
afford
to
hang
up
the
drive
and
the
water
is
going
down
every
day
we
got
to
have
more
water
i
tell
you
what
we
do
if
you
let
us
cut
down
the
new
sill
we
replace
it
in
good
shape
when
we
get
all
our
logs
sir
promptly
vetoed
the
old
man
we
give
you
something
for
the
privilege
what
do
you
think
is
fair
tell
ye
i
give
you
your
legal
rights
and
not
a
cent
more
replied
the
old
man
still
quietly
but
with
quivering
nostrils
is
your
name
asked
orde
name
is
reed
reed
stop
and
think
what
this
means
it
a
more
serious
matter
than
you
think
in
a
little
while
the
water
will
be
so
low
in
the
river
that
it
will
be
impossible
to
take
out
the
logs
this
year
that
means
a
large
loss
of
course
as
you
do
know
nothin
about
the
pesky
business
and
i
do
wan
to
snorted
reed
there
borers
for
one
thing
to
spoil
a
good
many
of
the
logs
and
think
what
it
will
mean
to
the
mills
no
logs
means
no
lumber
that
is
bankruptcy
for
a
good
many
who
have
contracts
to
fulfil
and
no
logs
means
the
mills
must
close
thousands
of
men
will
be
thrown
out
of
their
jobs
and
a
good
many
of
them
will
go
hungry
and
with
the
stream
full
of
the
old
cutting
that
means
less
to
do
next
winter
in
the
woods
more
men
thrown
out
getting
out
a
season
cut
with
the
is
a
pretty
serious
matter
to
a
great
many
people
and
if
you
insist
on
holding
us
up
here
in
this
slack
water
the
situation
will
soon
become
finished
demanded
reed
grimly
replied
orde
the
old
man
cast
from
him
his
piece
of
pine
he
closed
his
with
a
snap
and
thrust
it
in
his
pocket
he
brought
to
earth
the
front
legs
of
his
chair
with
a
thump
and
jammed
his
ruffled
plug
hat
to
its
proper
place
if
the
whole
kit
and
kaboodle
of
ye
starved
said
he
would
but
be
the
fulfillin
of
the
word
of
the
prophet
who
says
will
i
send
upon
you
famine
and
evil
beasts
and
they
shall
bereave
thee
and
pestilence
and
blood
shall
pass
through
thee
and
i
will
bring
the
sword
upon
thee
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
your
last
word
inquired
orde
my
last
word
and
my
first

that

smilin
land
waste
places
and
a
wilderness
by
your
own
folly
shall
ye
said
orde
whirling
on
his
heel
without
further
argument
the
young
man
who
had
during
this
colloquy
sat
an
interested
and
silent
spectator
arose
and
joined
him
orde
looked
at
his
new
companion
a
little
curiously
he
was
a
very
slender
young
man
but
impassive
in
demeanour
he
possessed
a
shrewd
thin
face
inscrutable
eyes
behind
glasses
his
costume
was
quite
simply
an
old
gray
suit
of
business
clothes
and
a
gray
felt
hat
at
the
moment
he
held
in
his
mouth
an
unlighted
and
badly
chewed
cigar
amiable
old
party
volunteered
orde
with
a
chuckle
to
be
agreed
the
young
man
drily
i
reckon
we
just
have
to
worry
along
without
him
remarked
orde
striking
his
steel
caulks
into
the
first
log
and
preparing
to
cross
out
into
the
river
where
the
work
was
going
on
a
minute
said
the
young
fellow
you
any
objections
to
my
hanging
around
a
little
to
watch
the
work
my
name
is
newmark
joseph
newmark
i
out
in
this
country
a
good
deal
for
my
health
this
thing

replied
orde
puzzled
all
you
want
to
the
but
can
you
put
me
up
can
i
get
a
chance
to
stay
with
you
a
little
while
as
far
as
i
concerned
agreed
orde
heartily
he
supplemented
with
one
of
his
contagious
chuckles
only
you
have
to
fix
it
up
with
the
doctor
the
cook
i
mean
he
explained
as
newmark
look
puzzled
find
him
at
camp
up
behind
that
brush
he
a
slim
handsome
fellow
with
a
jolly
expression
of
he
leaped
lightly
out
over
the
bobbing
timbers
leaving
newmark
to
find
his
way
in
the
centre
of
the
stream
the
work
had
been
gradually
slowing
down
to
a
standstill
with
the
subsidence
of
the
first
rush
of
water
after
the
was
opened
tom
north
leaning
gracefully
against
the
shaft
of
a
peavy
looked
up
eagerly
as
his
principal
approached
jack
he
inquired
it
to
be
peace
or
war
replied
orde
briefly
iii
at
this
moment
the
cook
stepped
into
view
and
making
a
trumpet
of
his
two
hands
sent
across
the
water
a
long
weird
and
not
unmusical
cry
the
men
at
once
began
slowly
to
drift
in
the
direction
of
the
camp
there
when
the
tin
plates
had
all
been
filled
and
each
had
found
a
place
to
his
liking
orde
addressed
them
his
manner
was
casual
and
conversational
said
he
old
mossback
who
owns
that
dam
has
come
up
here
loaded
to
scatter
he
built
up
the
sill
of
that
gate
until
we
get
a
draw
on
the
water
and
he
refuses
to
give
lend
or
sell
us
the
right
to
cut
her
out
i
made
him
every
reasonable
proposition
but
all
i
get
back
is
quotations
from
the
prophets
now
we
got
to
get
those
logs
out
that
what
we
here
for
a
fine
bunch
of
whitewater
birlers
we
look
if
we
got
hung
up
by
an
old
mossback
in
a
plug
hat
johnny
sims
what
the
answer
her
out
grinned
johnny
sims
briefly
replied
orde
with
a
chuckle
her
out
but
my
son
against
the
law
to
interfere
with
another
man
this
was
so
obviously
humourous
in
intent
that
its
only
reception
consisted
of
more
grins
from
everybody
went
on
orde
more
seriously
quite
a
job
we
ca
work
more
than
six
or
eight
men
at
it
at
a
time
we
got
to
work
as
fast
as
we
can
before
the
old
man
can
nearest
sheriff
at
spruce
rapids
commented
some
one
philosophically
have
sixty
men
all
told
said
orde
ought
to
be
able
to
carry
it
he
filled
his
plate
and
walked
across
to
a
vacant
place
here
he
found
himself
next
to
newmark
he
greeted
that
young
man
it
with
the
doctor
all
right
replied
newmark
in
his
brief
dry
manner
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
the
sheriff
is
not
at
spruce
rapids
but
at
the
village
expecting
orde
whistled
then
broke
into
a
roar
of
delight
he
called
plug
hat
got
the
sheriff
right
handy
i
guess
he
sort
of
expected
we
be
thinking
of
cutting
through
that
dam
you
like
to
go
to
jail
like
to
see
any
sheriff
take
us
to
jail
unless
he
had
an
army
with
him
growled
one
of
the
he
a
posse
inquired
orde
of
newmark
did
see
any
but
i
understood
in
the
village
that
the
governor
had
been
advised
to
hold
state
troops
in
readiness
for
orde
fell
into
a
brown
study
eating
mechanically
the
men
began
an
eager
and
somewhat
truculent
discussion
full
of
lawless
and
bloodthirsty
suggestion
some
suggested
the
kidnapping
and
sequestration
of
reed
until
the
affair
should
be
finished
he
get
hold
of
his
old
sheriff
then
they
inquired
with
some
pertinence
orde
however
paid
no
attention
to
all
this
talk
but
continued
to
frown
into
space
at
last
his
face
cleared
and
he
slapped
down
his
tin
plate
so
violently
that
the
knife
and
fork
jumped
off
into
the
dirt
have
it
he
cried
aloud
but
he
would
not
tell
what
he
had
after
the
noon
hour
he
instructed
a
men
to
provide
themselves
with
saws
axes
picks
and
shovels
and
all
marched
in
the
direction
of
the
mill
when
within
a
hundred
yards
or
so
of
that
structure
the
advancing
riverman
saw
the
lank
black
figure
of
the
mill
owner
flap
into
sight
astride
a
bony
old
horse
and
clatter
away
flying
up
the
road
and
into
the
waiting
forest
boys
cried
orde
crisply
be
back
in
an
hour
with
the
sheriff
lively
he
rapidly
designated
ten
men
of
his
crew
boys
get
to
work
and
make
things
hum
get
as
much
done
as
you
can
before
the
sheriff
have
to
bring
all
of
spruce
county
to
get
me
commented
one
of
those
chosen
spitting
on
his
hands
too
said
others
listen
said
orde
holding
them
with
an
impressive
gesture
that
sheriff
comes
with
or
without
a
posse
i
want
you
to
go
peaceably
understand
in
not
much
cried
purdy
here
and
orde
drew
them
aside
to
an
earnest
conversation
that
lasted
several
minutes
when
he
had
finished
he
clapped
each
of
them
on
the
back
and
all
moved
off
laughing
to
the
dam
boys
he
commanded
the
others
row
without
orders
understand
if
there
going
to
be
a
fight
i
give
you
the
word
the
chopping
crew
descended
to
the
bottom
of
the
sluice
the
gate
of
which
had
been
shut
and
began
immediately
to
chop
away
at
the
apron
as
the
water
in
the
pond
above
had
been
drawn
low
by
the
morning
work
none
overflowed
the
gate
so
the
men
were
enabled
to
work
dry
below
the
apron
of
course
had
been
filled
in
with
earth
and
stones
as
soon
as
the
had
effected
an
entry
to
this
deposit
other
men
with
shovels
and
picks
began
to
remove
the
filling
the
work
had
continued
nearly
an
hour
when
orde
commanded
the
fifty
or
more
idlers
back
to
camp
out
boys
he
ordered
sheriff
will
be
here
pretty
quick
now
and
i
do
want
any
row
get
out
of
leave
them
to
fight
her
out
alone
guess
not
grumbled
a
tall
burly
individual
with
a
red
face
orde
immediately
walked
directly
to
this
man
i
bossing
this
drive
or
am
i
not
he
demanded
the
riverman
growled
something
smack
smack
sounded
orde
fists
the
man
taken
by
surprise
went
down
in
a
heap
but
immediately
rebounded
to
his
feet
as
though
made
of
rubber
but
orde
had
seized
a
peavy
and
stood
over
against
his
antagonist
the
murderous
weapon
upraised
down
you
hound
or
i
brain
you
he
roared
at
the
top
strength
of
his
great
voice
fight
do
you
well
you
wo
have
to
wait
till
the
sheriff
gets
here
you
make
a
move
for
a
full
half
minute
the
man
crouched
breathless
and
orde
his
ruddy
face
congested
held
his
threatening
attitude
then
he
dropped
his
peavy
and
stepped
aside
he
commanded
your
turkey
and
hit
the
hay
trail
get
your
time
at
the
man
sullenly
arose
and
slouched
away
grumbling
under
his
breath
orde
watched
him
from
sight
then
turned
to
the
silent
group
a
new
crispness
in
his
manner
he
demanded
hesitating
they
turned
to
the
river
trail
leaving
the
ten
still
working
at
the
sluice
when
well
within
the
fringe
of
the
brush
orde
called
a
halt
his
customary
seemed
quite
restored
boys
he
commanded
down
and
lay
low
you
give
me
an
ache
do
you
suppose
i
got
this
thing
all
figured
out
if
fight
would
do
any
good
you
know
mighty
well
i
fight
and
the
boys
wo
be
in
jail
any
longer
than
it
takes
to
get
a
wire
to
daly
to
bail
them
out
smoke
up
and
do
they
filled
their
pipes
and
settled
down
to
an
enjoyment
of
the
situation
ordinarily
from
very
early
in
the
morning
until
very
late
at
night
the
riverman
is
busy
every
instant
at
his
dangerous
and
absorbing
work
those
affairs
which
do
not
immediately
concern
his
task
as
the
swiftness
of
rapids
the
state
of
flood
the
curves
of
streams
the
height
of
water
the
obstructions
of
channels
the
quantities
of
logs
pass
by
the
outer
fringe
of
his
consciousness
if
indeed
they
reach
him
at
all
thus
often
he
works
all
day
up
to
his
waist
in
a
current
bearing
the
rotten
ice
of
the
first
or
endures
the
drenching
of
an
early
spring
rain
or
battles
the
rigours
of
a
belated
snow
with
apparent
indifference
you
or
i
would
be
exceedingly
uncomfortable
would
require
an
effort
of
fortitude
to
make
the
plunge
yet
these
men
absorbed
in
the
mighty
problems
of
their
task
have
little
attention
to
spare
to
such
things
the
cold
the
wet
the
discomfort
the
hunger
the
weariness
all
pass
as
shadows
on
the
background
in
like
manner
the
softer
moods
of
the
spring
rarely
penetrate
through
the
concentration
of
faculties
on
the
work
the
warm
sun
shines
the
birds
by
thousands
flutter
and
twitter
and
sing
their
way
north
the
delicate
green
of
spring
showered
from
the
hand
of
the
passing
sower
sprinkles
the
tops
of
the

and
gradually
sifts
down
through
the
branches
the
great
beautiful
silver
clouds
sail
down
the
horizon
like
ships
of
a
statelier
age
as
totally
without
actual
existence
to
these
men
the
logs
the
river
those
are
enough
to
strain
all
the
faculties
a
man
possesses
and
more
so
when
as
now
a
chance
combination
of
circumstances
brings
them
leisure
to
look
about
them
the
forest
and
the
world
of
comes
to
them
with
a
freshness
impossible
for
the
city
dweller
to
realise
the
surroundings
are
accustomed
but
they
bring
new
messages
to
most
of
them
these
impressions
never
reach
the
point
of
coherency
they
brood
and
muse
and
expand
in
the
actual
and
figurative
warmth
and
proffer
the
general
opinion
that
it
is
a
damn
fine
day
another
full
half
hour
elapsed
before
the
situation
developed
further
then
tom
north
friend
jim
who
had
gathered
his
long
figure
on
the
top
of
a
stump
unclasped
his
knees
and
remarked
that
old
plug
hat
was
back
the
men
arose
to
their
feet
and
peered
cautiously
through
the
brush
they
saw
reed
accompanied
by
a
man
whom
some
recognised
as
the
sheriff
of
the
county
approach
the
edge
of
the
dam
a
moment
later
the
working
crew
mounted
to
the
top
stacked
their
tools
neatly
resumed
their
coats
and
jackets
and
departed
up
the
road
in
convoy
of
the
sheriff
a
gasp
of
astonishment
broke
from
the
concealed
rivermen
i
be
damned
ejaculated
one
are
we
comin
to
the
first
time
i
ever
see
one
lonesome
sheriff
gather
in
ten
without
the
aid
of
a
gatlin
or
an
ambulance
what
the
matter
with
that
bunch
anyway
orde
watched
them
his
eyes
expressionless
until
they
had
disappeared
in
the
fringe
of
the
forest
then
he
turned
to
the
astonished
group
said
he
you
ellis
and
you
and
you
and
you
and
you
get
to
work
on
that
dam
and
remember
this
if
you
are
arrested
go
peaceably
any
resistance
will
spoil
the
whole
the
men
broke
into
mingled
cheers
and
laughter
as
the
full
significance
of
orde
plan
reached
them
they
streamed
back
to
the
dam
where
they
perched
proffering
advice
and
encouragement
to
those
about
to
descend
immediately
however
reed
was
out
his
eyes
blazing
either
side
his
hawk
nose
he
cried
that
i
have
ye
arrested
ahead
replied
orde
coldly
reed
stormed
back
and
forth
for
a
moment
then
departed
at
full
speed
up
the
road
boys
get
as
much
done
as
possible
urged
orde
better
get
back
in
the
brush
or
he
may
try
to
take
in
the
whole
of
us
on
some
sort
of
a
blanket
about
the
other
boys
inquired
north
gave
one
of
them
a
telegram
to
send
to
daly
replied
orde
will
be
up
to
bail
them
once
more
they
hid
in
the
woods
and
again
after
a
longer
interval
the
mill
owner
and
the
sheriff
reappeared
reed
appeared
to
be
expostulating
violently
and
a
number
of
times
pointed
up
river
but
the
sheriff
went
ahead
stolidly
to
the
dam
summoned
those
working
below
and
departed
up
the
road
as
before
reed
stood
uncertain
until
he
saw
the
rivermen
beginning
to
from
the
brush
then
followed
the
officer
at
top
speed
without
the
necessity
of
command
a
men
leaped
down
on
the
apron
the
previous
crews
had
made
considerable
progress
in
weakening
the
heavy
supports
as
soon
as
these
should
be
cut
out
and
the
backing
removed
the
mere
sawing
through
of
the
massive
sill
should
carry
away
the
whole
obstruction
time
will
decide
it
remarked
orde
the
sheriff
brings
a
posse
and
sits
down
to
lay
for
us
of
course
we
wo
be
able
to
get
near
to
finish
the
did
think
that
of
george
morris
commented
sims
in
an
aggrieved
way
was
a
riverman
himself
once
before
he
was
got
to
obey
orders
and
serve
a
warrant
when
it
issued
of
course
replied
orde
to
this
did
you
expect
at
the
end
of
another
hour
which
brought
the
time
to
four
the
sheriff
made
his
third
appearance
this
time
in
a
buggy
wish
i
dared
join
that
confab
said
orde
hear
what
going
on
but
i
afraid
he
jug
me
would
jug
me
spoke
up
newmark
go
for
you
agreed
orde
the
young
man
departed
in
his
precise
methodical
manner
picking
his
way
rather
mincingly
among
the
inequalities
of
the
trail
in
spite
of
the
worn
and
wrinkled
condition
of
his
garments
they
retained
something
of
a
city
hang
and
smartness
that
sharply
differentiated
their
wearer
from
even
the
citizens
of
a
smaller
town
they
seemed
to
match
the
refined
shrewd
but
cold
intelligence
of
his
lean
and
nervous
face
about
sunset
he
returned
from
a
scene
which
the
distant
spectators
had
watched
with
breathless
interest
it
was
in
essence
only
a
repetition
of
the
two
that
had
preceded
it
but
reed
had
evidently
gone
almost
to
the
point
of
violence
in
his
insistence
and
the
sheriff
had
shaken
him
off
rudely
finally
morris
and
his
six
prisoners
had
trailed
away
the
sheriff
and
north
friend
occupied
the
seat
of
the
buggy
while
the
other
five
trudged
peaceably
alongside
once
again
reed
clattered
away
on
his
bony
steed
but
this
time
ahead
of
the
official
party
with
a
whoop
the
river
crew
now
reduced
to
a
scant
dozen
rushed
down
to
meet
the
too
deliberate
newmark
they
demanded
crowding
about
him
wanted
the
sheriff
to
stay
and
protect
the
dam
reported
newmark
in
his
brief
dry
manner
refused
said
his
duty
was
simply
to
arrest
on
warrant
and
as
often
as
reed
got
out
warrants
he
serve
them
reed
said
then
he
should
get
a
posse
and
hunt
up
orde
and
the
rest
of
them
sheriff
replied
that
as
far
as
he
could
see
the
terms
of
his
warrant
were
covered
by
the
men
he
found
working
on
the
dam
reed
demanded
protection
sheriff
said
for
him
to
get
an
injunction
and
it
would
be
that
all
right
interjected
orde
with
satisfaction
have
her
cut
through
before
he
gets
that
injunction
and
i
guess
got
men
enough
here
and
down
river
to
get
through
before
we
all
said
newmark
all
very
well
but
now
he
gone
to
telegraph
the
governor
to
send
the
orde
whistled
a
jig
tune
of
expected
that
boys
said
he

the
next
train
out
from
redding

here
by
five
in
the
morning

commanded
one
of
the
cookees
up

report
if
morris

this
time
we
have
to
scatter

wo
have

though
like
to
keep
everything
square
on
account
of
this

troop
the
sun
had
dropped
below
the
fringe
of
trees
which
immediately
etched
their
delicate
outlines
against
a
pale
translucent
green
sky
two
straight
thin
columns
of
smoke
rose
from
the
neglected
orde
glancing
around
him

these
he
commanded
sharply
at
your
grub

some
coffee
right
off
and
bring
it
down

the
lanterns
from
the
wanigan
and
bring
them

come
down

pond
above
had
recovered
its
volume
water
was
beginning
to
trickle
over
the
top
of
the
gate
in
a
short
time
progress
became
difficult
almost
impossible
the
men
worked
up
to
their
knees
in
swift
water
they
could
not
see
and
the
strokes
of
axe
or
pick
lost
much
of
their
force
against
the
liquid
dusk
fell
the
fringe
of
the
forest

mysterious
in
its
velvet
dark
silver
streaks
of
a
supernal
calm

reaches
of

and
receded
and
dissolved
and
melted
away
until
through
the
pale
afterglow
one
saw
beyond
into
the
infinities
down
by
the
sluice
a
dozen
lanterns
flickered
and
blinked
yellow
against
the
of

night

some
time

crew
off
and

become
too
deep

work

a
half
hour

reduce

pressure

and
in

of

night

of
the
whispering
breeze
and
the
rushing
water

to
like
death
to
a
dead
nigger
was
his
comment
newmark
having
extracted
a
kind
of
cardigan
jacket
from
the
bag
he
had
brought
with
him
as
far
as
the
mill
looked
at
the
smooth
water
and
shivered
when
the
meal
was
finished
the
men
lit
their
pipes
and
went
back
to
work
philosophically
with
entire
absorption
in
the
task
they
dug
chopped
and
picked
the
dull
sound
of
blows
the
gurgle
and
trickle
of
the
water
the
occasional
grunt
or
brief
comment
of
a
riverman
alone
broke
the
calm
of
evening

was
down
and
the
water
had
ceased
temporarily
to
flow

went

expert

to
the
taciturn
newmark
that
he
thought
they
make
it
near
midnight
however
a
swaying
lantern
was
seen
approaching

leaping
to
his
feet
with
a
curse
at
the

the
sound
of

a
moment
later

form
stepped
into
the
illumination
of
the
fire

wandered
over
to

principal
stood
peering
about
him

orde
coolly
logs

daly
tugging
at
his
overcoat
pocket
and
finally
producing
a
newspaper
about
this
orde
unfolded
the
paper
and
lowered
it
to
the
campfire
it
was
an
extra
screaming
with
wood
type
he
read
it
deliberately
over
war
the
headline
ran
rioting
and
bloodshed
in
the
woods
rivermen
and
dam
owners
clash
there
followed
a
vague
and
highly
coloured
statement
to
the
effect
that
an
initial
skirmish
had
left
the
field
in
possession
of
the
rivermen
in
spite
of
the
sheriff
and
a
large
posse
but
that
troops
were
being
rushed
to
the
spot
and
that
this
defiance
of
would
undoubtedly
soon
be
suppressed
it
concluded
truthfully
with
the
statement
that
the
loss
of
life
was
as
yet
unknown
orde
folded
up
the
paper
and
handed
it
back
you
know
any
better
than
to
get
into
that
kind
of
a
row
down
here
daly
had
been
saying
you
want
to
bring
us
up
for
good
here
do
you
realise
that
this
is
the
northern
peninsula
what
are
you
trying
to
do
any
way
i
do
replied
orde
placidly
along
here
till
i
show
you
the
ten
minutes
later
daly
relieved
in
his
mind
was
standing
by
the
fire
drinking
hot
coffee
and
laughing
at
orde
description
of
reed
plug
hat
to
orde
satisfaction
the
sheriff
did
not
reappear
reed
evidently
now
pinned
his
faith
to
the
state
troops
all
night
the
work
went
on
the
men
spelling
each
other
at
intervals
of
every
few
hours
by
three
the
main
abutments
had
been
removed
the
gate
was
then
blocked
to
prevent
its
fall
when
its
nether
support
should
be
withdrawn
and
two
men
leaning
over
cautiously
began
at
to
deliver
their
against
the
middle
of
the
of
the
sluice
itself
notching
each
heavy
beam
deeply
that
the
force
of
the
current
might
finally
break
it
in
two
the
night
was
very
dark
and
very
still
even
the
night
creatures
had
fallen
into
the
quietude
that
precedes
the
first
morning
hours
the
muffled
spaced
blows
of
the
axes
the
comments
or
directions
of
the
workers
the
crackle
of
the
fire
ashore
were
thrown
by
contrast
into
an
undue
importance
men
in
blankets
awaiting
their
turn
slept
close
to
the
blaze
suddenly
the
vast
silence
of
before
dawn
was
broken
by
a
loud
and
exultant
yell
from
one
of
the
axemen
at
once
the
two
scrambled
to
the
top
of
the
dam
the
blanketed
figures
about
the
fire
sprang
to
life
a
brief
instant
later
the
snapping
of
wood
fibres
began
like
the
rapid
explosions
of
infantry
fire
a
crash
and
bang
of
timbers
smote
the
air
and
then
the
river
exultant
roaring
with
joy
rushed
from
its
pent
quietude
into
the
new
passage
opened
for
it
at
the
same
moment
as
though
at
the
signal
a
single
bird
premonitor
of
the
yet
distant
day
lifted
up
his
voice
clearly
audible
above
the
tumult
orde
stormed
into
the
camp
up
stream
his
eyes
bright
his
big
voice
booming
exultantly
out

shouted
to
those
who
had
worked
out
their
shifts
earlier
in
the
night

the
little
birds

newmark
who
had
sat
up
the
night
through
and
now
shivered
sleepily
by
the
fire

to
hunt
around
for

earlier
in
the
evening
dumped
down
somewhere
in

lips

frozen
in
an
attitude
of
attentive
listening

he
faint
still
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
the
wandering
morning
breeze
bore
to
their
ears
a
sound
whose
difference
from
the
louder
noises
nearer
at

alone
rendered
it
audible

exclaimed

he
seized
a
lantern
and
returned
down
the
trail

eagerly
by
newmark
and
every
man
in

coming

orde
to

men

a
little
to

side

line
of
the
forest

against

to
stir
in
its
blackness

heard
quite
distinctly

clink
of

man
rode
out
of
the
shadow
and
reined
up
by
the
fire

voice

violence

good
night

the
fringe
of
trees
to
eastward
showed
clearly
against
the
whitening
sky
hundreds
of
birds
of
all
kinds
sang
in
an
ecstasy
another
day
had
begun
already
men
with
were
guiding
the
sullen
timbers
toward
the
iv
when
newmark
awoke
once
more
to
interest
in
affairs
the
morning
was
well
spent
on
the
river
the
work
was
going
forward
with
the
precision
of
clockwork
the
lowering
of
the
had
produced
a
fine
current
which
sucked
the
logs
down
from
above
men
were
busily
engaged
in
them
from
the
sides
of
the
pond
toward
its
centre
lest
the
lowering
water
should
leave
them
stranded
below
the
dam
the
jam
crew
was
finding
plenty
to
do
in
keeping
them
moving
in
the
and
the
shallows
a
fine
sun
tempered
with
a
prophetic
warmth
of
later
spring
animated
the
scene
reed
had
withdrawn
to
the
interior
of
his
mill
and
appeared
to
have
given
up
the
contest
some
of
the
logs
shot
away
down
the
current
running
freely
to
these
the
crews
were
not
required
to
pay
any
attention
with
luck
a
few
of
the
individual
timbers
would
float
ten
even
twenty
miles
before
some
chance
eddy
or
fortuitous
obstruction
would
bring
them
to
rest
such
eddies
and
obstructions
however
drew
a
constant
toll
from
the
ranks
of
the
logs
so
that
always
the
volume
of
timbers
floating
with
the
current
diminished
and
always
the
number
of
logs
caught
and
stranded
along
the
sides
of
the
river
increased
to
restore
these
to
the
faster
water
was
the
especial
province
of
the
last
and
most
expert
crew
the
rear
orde
discovered
about
noon
that
the
jam
crew
was
having
its
troubles
immediately
below
reed
dam
ran
a
long
chute
strewn
with
boulders
which
was
alternately
a
shallow
or
a
stretch
of
according
as
the
stream
rose
or
fell
ordinarily
the
logs
were
flushed
over
this
declivity
by
opening
the
gate
behind
which
a
head
of
water
had
been
accumulated
now
however
the
efficiency
of
the
gate
had
been
destroyed
orde
early
discovered
that
he
was
likely
to
have
trouble
in
preventing
the
logs
rushing
through
the
chute
from
grounding
into
a
bad
jam
on
the
rapids
below
for
a
time
the
jam
crew
succeeded
in
keeping
the
clear
in
the
centre
of
the
stream
however
a
small
jam
formed
like
a
pier
along
the
banks
logs
grounded
and
were
rolled
over
by
their
own
momentum
into
places
so
shallow
as
to
discourage
any
hope
of
refloating
them
unless
by
main
strength
as
the
sluicing
of
the
nine
or
ten
million
feet
that
constituted
this
particular
drive
went
forward
the
situation
rapidly
became
worse
we
got
to
get
unless
we
want
to
run
into
an
awful
job
there
said
orde
to
the
foreman
wonder
if
we
ca
drop
that
gate
down
to
get
something
for
a
the
two
men
examined
the
chute
and
the
attentively
for
some
time
we
could
clear
out
the
splinters
and
rubbish
we
might
spike
a
couple
of
saplings
on
each
side
for
the
gate
to
slide
down
into
speculated
north
try
her
the
logs
were
held
up
in
the
pond
and
a
crew
of
men
set
to
work
to
cut
away
as
well
as
they
might
in
the
rush
of
water
the
splintered
ends
of
the
old
sill
and
apron
it
was
hard
work
newmark
watching
thought
it
impracticable
the
current
rendered
footing
impossible
so
all
the
work
had
to
be
done
from
above
wet
wood
gripped
the
long
saws
so
that
a
man
utmost
strength
could
scarcely
budge
them
the
water
deadened
the
force
of
nevertheless
with
the
sure
persistence
of
the
riverman
they
held
to
it
orde
watching
them
a
few
moments
satisfied
himself
that
they
would
succeed
and
so
departed
up
river
to
take
charge
of
the
rear
this
crew
he
found
working
busily
among
some
overflowed
woods
they
were
herding
the
laggards
of
the
flock
the
subsidence
of
the
water
consequent
upon
the
opening
of

left
stranded
and
in
shallows
many
hundreds
of
the
logs
these
the
men
sometimes
waist
deep
in
the
icy
water
owing
to
the
extreme
inequality
of
the
bottom
were
rolling
over
and
over
with
their
peavies
until
once
more
they
floated
some
few
the
rivermen
were
forced
to
carry
bodily
ten
men
to
a
side
the
peavies
clamped
in
as
handles
when
once
they
were
afloat
the
task
became
easier
from
the
advantage
of
deadwood
stumps
or
other
logs
the
pushed
the
unwieldy
timbers
forward
leaping
splashing
heaving
shoving
until
at
last
the
steady
current
of
the
main
river
seized
the
logs
and
bore
them
away
with
marvellous
skill
they
topped
the
dripping
bobby
rolling
timbers
treading
them
over
and
over
back
and
forth
in
unconscious
preservation
of
equilibrium
there
was
a
good
deal
of
noise
and
fun
at
the
rear
the
crew
had
been
divided
and
a
half
worked
on
either
side
the
river
a
rivalry
developed
as
to
which
side
should
advance
fastest
in
the
sacking
it
became
a
race
momentary
success
in
getting
ahead
of
the
other
fellow
was
occasion
for
exultant
crowing
while
a
mishap
called
forth
ironic
cheers
and
catcalls
from
the
rival
camp
just
as
orde
came
tramping
up
the
trail
one
of
the
rivermen
caulks
failed
to
on
an
unusually
smooth
barked
surface
his
foot
slipped
the
log
rolled
he
tried
in
vain
to
regain
his
balance
and
finally
fell
in
with
a
heavy
splash
the
entire
river
suspended
work
to
send
up
a
howl
of
delight
as
the
unfortunate
crawled
out
dripping
from
head
to
foot
he
was
greeted
by
a
flood
of
sarcasm
and
profane
inquiry
that
left
no
room
for
even
his
acknowledged
talents
of
repartee
cursing
and
ashamed
he
made
his
way
ashore
over
the
logs
spirting
water
at
every
step
there
he
wrung
out
his
woollen
clothes
as
dry
as
he
could
and
resumed
work
hardly
had
orde
the
opportunity
to
look
about
at
the
progress
making
however
before
he
heard
his
name
shouted
from
the
bank
looking
up
to
his
surprise
he
saw
the
solemn
cook
waving
a
frantic
at
him
nothing
could
induce
the
cook
to
attempt
the
logs
is
it
charlie
asked
orde
leaping
ashore
and
stamping
the
loose
water
from
his
boots
all
off
confided
the
cook
pessimistically
no
good
stopped
us
off
who
stopped
what
he
druv
the
men
from
the
dam
with
a
shotgun
we
might
as
well
hey
exclaimed
orde
the
old
son
of
a
gun
he
thought
a
moment
his
lips
puckered
as
though
to
whistle
then
as
usual
he
laughed
amusedly
go
take
a
look
at
the
army
said
he
he
swung
away
at
a
round
pace
followed
rather
breathlessly
by
the
cook
the
trail
led
through
the
brush
across
a
little
flat
point
up
over
a
high
bluff
where
the
river
swung
in
down
to
another
point
and
across
a
pole
trail
above
a
marsh
to
camp
a
pole
trail
consists
of
saplings
laid
end
to
end
and
supported
three
or
four
feet
above
wet
places
by
means
of
structures
at
their
extremities
to
a
or
a
dancer
they
are
easy
walks
all
others
must
proceed
cautiously
in
contrite
memory
of
their
sins
orde
marched
across
the
first
two
lengths
confidently
enough
then
he
heard
a
splash
and
lamentations
turning
he
perceived
charlie
covered
with
mud
in
the
act
of
clambering
up
one
of
the
small
trestles
got
no
caulks
ran
the
lamentations
of
a
of
a
anyways
he
walked
ahead
gingerly
threw
his
hands
aloft
bent
forward
then
suddenly
protruded
his
stomach
held
out
one
foot
in
front
of
him
spasmodically
half
turned
and
then
realising
the
case
hopeless
wilted
like
a
wet
rag
to
clasp
the
pole
trail
both
by
arm
and
leg
this
saved
him
from
falling
off
altogether
but
swung
him
underneath
where
he
hung
like
the
sloths
in
the
a
series
of
violent
wriggles
brought
him
and
panting
astride
the
pole
whence
his
feelings
beyond
mere
speech
he
sadly
eyed
his
precious
derby
which
lay
crown
up
in
the
mud
below
orde
contemplated
the
spectacle
seriously
i
have
got
time
to
enjoy
you
just
now
charlie
he
remarked
take
it
slower
if
i
were
he
departed
catching
fragments
of
vows
anent
never
going
on
any
more
errands
for
nobody
and
getting
his
time
if
ever
again
he
went
away
from
his
wanigan
orde
stopped
short
outside
the
fringe
of
brush
to
utter
another
irrepressible
chuckle
of
amusement
the
centre
of
the
dam
was
occupied
by
reed
the
old
man
was
still
in
full
regalia
his
plug
hat
fuzzier
than
ever
and
thrust
even
farther
back
on
his
head
his
and
loose
trousers
flapping
at
his
every
movement
as
he
paced
back
and
forth
with
military
precision
over
his
shoulder
he
carried
a
long
shotgun
not
thirty
feet
away
perched
along
the
bank
for
all
the
world
like
a
row
of
cormorants
sat
the
rivermen
watching
him
solemnly
and
in
silence
the
matter
inquired

approaching
the
old
man
surveyed
him
with
a
snort
of
disgust

he
walked
back
to

smiling
quizzically
you

nobody
answered

a

in
his
direction
correct
son
he
drawled
we
engaged
in
the
happy
occupation
of
getting
out
logs
by
the

all
adjusted

damages
why
we
count
legal

as
part

it
lucky
so
he
added
anybody

any
attention
to
legal
technicalities
there
never

a
man
always
has
enemies
what

he
confessed
if
necessary
we
pile
the
old
he
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
dam
and
stood
looking
down
current
for
perhaps
a
full
minute
he
remained
there
motionless
his
hat
clinging
to
one
side
his
hand
in
his
hair
then
he
returned
to
the
grimly
silent
rivermen
he
commanded
briefly
your
peavies
and
come
he
led
the
way
past
the
mill
to
the
shallows
below
a
trifle
of
wading
to
do
he
announced
down
two
logs
fairly
big
and

up

ticket

had
been
splashing
about
in
the
shallow
water
showing
where
each
timber
was
to
be
placed
he
drew
back
eyeing
the
result
with
satisfaction
it
looked
rather
like
a
small
and
bristly
pier
next
he
cast
his
eye
about
and
discovered
a
partially
submerged
boulder
on
a
line
with
the
newly
completed
structure
against
this
he
braced
the
ends
of
two
more
logs
on
which
he
once
more
caused
to
be
loaded
at
right
angles
many
timbers
an
old
stub
near
shore
furnished
him
the
basis
of
a
third
pier
he
staked
a
butt
for
a
fourth
and
so
on
until
the
piers
in
conjunction
with
the
small
centre
jam
already
mentioned
extended
quite
across
the
river
all
this
was
accomplished
in
a
very
short
time
and
immediately
below
the
mill
but
beyond
sight
from
the
of
the
dam
boys
commanded
orde
off
some
shore
logs
and
let
them
come
have
a

purdy
stupidly
my
son

we
mocked

surely
hope
not
the
stray
logs
floating
down
with
the
current
the
rivermen
caught
and
arranged
to
the
best
possible
advantage
about
the
improvised
piers

good
riverman
understands
the
correlation
of
forces
represented
by
and
he
knows
how
to
look
for
the
in
breaking
jams
and
by
the
inverse
reasoning
when
need
arises
he
can
form
a
jam
as
expertly
as
himself

brings
about

and
undesired

our
pipes

our
last
match
and
brings
rain
on
the
just
when
they
want
to
go
so
in
ten
seconds
after
the
shore
logs
began
drifting
down
from
above
the
jam
was
taking
shape
slowly
it
formed
low
and
broad
then
as
the

immediately
the
pressure
increased
more
logs

piled
on
top
the
piers
locked
the
structure
below
the
improvised

water
fell
almost
to
nothing

above
it

for

opening

said
orde
with
satisfaction
he
led
the
way
to
the
bank
and
sat
down
the
men
followed
his
example
every
moment
the
water
rose
and
each
instant
as
more
logs
came
down
the
current

old

caused
his

to
be
built
nearly
at
a
level
with
the
stream
now
the
river
backing
up
rapidly
overflowed
this
flat
as
the
jam
tightened
by
its
own
weight
and
the
accumulation
of
logs
the
water
fairly
jumped
from

of

why
do
you
break
it
the
old
warrior
ran
up
the
bank
to
where
he
could
get
a
good
view
of
his
property
the
water
was
pouring
into
the
windows
he
cried
running
back
a
lot
of
grain
it
be
ruined
interested
repeated
orde
reed
was
rapidly
losing
control
of
himself
i

a
lot
of

he
shouted
miserable
blackguard

ruining
me
orde
replaced
his
pipe
reed
ran
back
and
forth
frantically
disappeared
returned
bearing
an
antiquated
and
and
alone
attacked
the
jam
astonishment
and
delight
held
the
rivermen
breathless
for
a
moment
then
a
roar
of
laughter
drowned
even
the
noise
of
the
waters
men
pounded
each
other
on
the
back
rolled
over
and
over
clutching
handfuls
of
earth
struggled
weak
and
for
breath
as
they
saw
against
the
of
the
bristling
jam
the
lank
flapping
figure
with
the
old
plug
hat
pushing
frantically
against
the
immovable
statics
of
a
mighty
power
the
exasperation
of
delay
the
anxiety
lest
success
be
lost
through
the
mulish
and
obstinacy
of
one
man
the
resentment
against
another
obstacle
not
to
be
foreseen
and
not
to
be
expected
in
a
task
redundantly
supplied
with
obstacles
of
its
own
these
found
relief
at
last
jove
breathed
newmark
softly
to
himself
quixote
and
the
windmills
then
he
added
vindictively
old
fool
although
of
course
the
drive
was
not
his
personal
concern
only
orde
seemed
to
see
the
other
side
and
on
orde
the
responsibility
uncertainty
and
vexation
had
borne
most
heavily
for
the
success
of
the
undertaking
was
in
his
hands
with
a
few
quick
leaps
he
had
gained
the
old
man
side
here
reed
he
said
kindly
ca

this
jam
come
ashore
now
and
let
up

turned
to
him
a
wild
light
in
his
eye
it
he
pleaded
ruining

got
all
my

that
said
orde
got
a

frantically
toward

no

we

a
little
let
talk
it
he
led
the
old
man
ashore
and
out
of
earshot
of
the
rivermen
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
he
returned
over
boys
he
shouted
cheerfully
in
and
break
that
at
once
the
crew
swarmed
across
the
log
barrier
to
a
point
above
the
centre
pier
this
they
attacked
with
their
peavies
rolling
the
top
logs
off
into
the
current
below
in
less
than
no
time
they
had
torn
out
quite
a
hole
in
the
top
layer
the
river
rushed
through
the
opening
immediately
the
logs
in
the
wings
were
tumbled
in
from
either
side
at
first
the
men
had
to
do
all
of
the
work
but
soon
the
river
itself
turned
to
their
assistance
timbers
creaked
and
settled
or
rose
slightly
buoyant
as
the
water
loosened
the
tangle
men
trod
on
the
edge
of
expectation
constantly
the
logs
shifted
and
as
constantly
the
men
shifted
also
avoiding
the
upheavals
and
grindings
together
wary
eyes
estimating
the
correlation
of
the
forces
into
whose
crushing
reach
a
single
misstep
would
bring
them
the
movement
accelerated
each
instant
as
the
music
of
the
play
hastens
to
the
climax
wood
fibres
smashed
the
whole
mass
seemed
to
sink
down
and
forward
into
a
boiling
of
waters
then
with
a
creak
and
a
groan
the
jam
moved
hesitated
moved
again
finally
urged
by
the
frantic
river
went
out
in
a
majestic
crashing
and
battering
of
logs
at
the
first
movement
newmark
expected
the
rivermen
to
make
their
escape
instead
they
stood
at
attention
their
peavies
poised
watching
the
symptoms
of
the
break
twice
or
thrice
several
of
the
men
observing
something
not
evident
to
newmark
unpractised
eye
ran
forward
used
their
peavies
vigorously
for
a
moment
or
so
and
stood
back
to
watch
the
result
only
at
the
very
last
when
it
would
seem
that
some
of
them
must
surely
he
caught
did
the
using
their
as
balancing
poles
zigzag
calmly
to
shore
across
the
plunging
logs
newmark
seemed
impressed
was
a
close
shave
said
he
to
the
last
man
ashore
inquired
the
riverman
see
it
somebody
fall
down
no
explained
newmark
in
off
those
logs
without
getting
said
the
man
indifferently
turning
away
the
going
out
of
the
jam
drained
the
water
from
the
lower
floors
of
the
mill
the
upper
stories
and
the
grain
were
still
safe
by
evening
the
had
been
roughly
provided
with
pole
guides
down
which
to
slide
to
the
bed
of
the
river
the
following
morning
saw
the
work
going
on
as
methodically
as
ever
during
the
night
a
very
good
head
of
water
had
gathered
behind
the
lowered
gate
the
rear
crew
brought
down
the
afterguard
of
logs
to
the
pond
the
sluicers
with
their
long
thrust
the
logs
into
the
chute
the
jam
crew
scattered
for
many
miles
along
the
lower
stretches
kept
the
drive
going
running
out
over
the
surface
of
the
river
like
to
thrust
apart
logs
threatening
to
lock
leaning
for
hours
on
the
shafts
of
their
peavies
watching
contemplatively
the
orderly
ranks
as
they
drifted
by
sleepy
on
the
bosom
of
the
river
occasionally
gathering
as
the
filling
of
the
river
gave
warning
to
break
a
jam
by
the
end
of
the
second
day
the
pond
was
clear
and
as
charlie
wanigan
was
drifting
toward
the
chute
the
first
of
johnson
drive
floated
into
the
head
of
the
pond
v
charlie
wanigan
in
case
you
do
not
happen
to
know
what
such
a
thing
may
be
was
a
scow
about
twenty
feet
long
by
ten
wide
it
was
very
solidly
constructed
of
hewn
timbers
square
at
both
ends
was
inconceivably
clumsy
and
weighed
an
unbelievable
number
of
pounds
when
loaded
it
carried
all
the
tents
provisions
cooking
utensils
tools
and
a
chest
of
tobacco
clothes
and
other
minor
supplies
it
was
managed
by
charlie
and
his
two
cookees
by
means
of
and
a
long
sweep
at
either
end
the
assured
progress
when
the
current
slacked
the
sweeps
kept
her
when
drifting
with
the
stream
charlie
temperament
was
pessimistic
at
best
when
the
wanigan
was
to
be
moved
he
rose
fairly
to
the
heights
of
what
might
be
called
destructive
prophecy
the
packing
began
before
the
men
had
finished
breakfast
shortly
after
daylight
the
wanigan
pushed
strongly
from
shore
by
the
was
drifting
toward
the
chute
when
the
heavy
scow
threatened
to
turn
the
sweeps
at
either
end
churned
the
water
frantically
in
an
endeavour
to
straighten
her
out
sometimes
by
a
misunderstanding
they
worked
against
each
other
then
charlie
raging
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
satellites
frothed
and
roared
commands
and
vituperations
his
voice
rose
to
a
shriek
the
cookees
bewildered
by
so
much
violence
lost
their
heads
completely
then
charlie
abruptly
fell
to
an
exaggerated
calm
he
sat
down
amidships
on
a
pile
of
bags
and
gazed
with
ostentatious
indifference
out
over
the
pond
finally
in
a
voice
fallen
almost
to
a
whisper
and
with
an
elaborate
politeness
charlie
proffered
a
request
that
his
assistants
acquire
the
sense
god
gave
a
rooster
newmark
who
had
elected
to
accompany
the
wanigan
on
its
voyage
evidently
found
it
vastly
amusing
for
his
eyes
twinkled
behind
his
glasses
as
the
wanigan
neared
the
sluice
through
which
it
must
shoot
the
the
excitement
mounted
to
fever
pitch
the
water
boiled
under
the
strokes
of
the
long
steering
oars
the
air
swirled
with
the
multitude
and
vigour
of
charlie
commands
as
many
of
the
driving
crew
as
were
within
distance
gathered
to
watch
it
was
a
supreme
moment
as
newmark
looked
at
the
smooth
rim
of
the
water
sucking
into
the
chute
he
began
to
wonder
why
he
had
come
however
the
noble
ship
was
pointed
right
at
last
and
caught
the
faster
water
even
charlie
managed
to
look
cheerful
for
an
instant
and
to
grin
at
his
passenger
as
he
wiped
his
forehead
with
a
very
old
red
handkerchief
right
now
he
shouted
zeke
and
his
mate
took
in
the
oars
the
wanigan
shot
forward
below
the
gate
whack
bump
bang
and
the
scow
stopped
so
suddenly
that
its
four
men
plunged
forward
in
a
miscellaneous
heap
while
zeke
narrowly
escaped
going
overboard
almost
immediately
the
water
backed
up
behind
the
stern
began
to
overflow
into
the
boat
newmark
clearing
his
vision
as
well
as
he
could
for
lack
of
his
glasses
saw
that
the
scow
had
evidently
run
her
bow
on
an
obstruction
and
had
been
brought
to
a
standstill
square
beneath
the
men
seemed
to
be
running
toward
them
the
water
was
beginning
to
flow
the
entire
length
of
the
boat
various
lighter
articles
shot
past
him
and
disappeared
over
the
side
charlie
had
gone
crazy
and
was
grabbing
at
these
quite
uselessly
for
as
fast
as
he
had
caught
one
thing
he
let
it
go
in
favour
of
another
the
cookees
retaining
some
small
degree
of
coolness
were
pushing
uselessly
with
newmark
had
an
inspiration
the
more
important
matters
such
as
the
men
the
rolls
of
bedding
and
the
heavier
supplies
of
provisions
had
not
yet
cut
loose
from
their
moorings
although
the
rapid
backing
of
the
water
threatened
soon
to
convert
the
wanigan
into
a
chute
for
nearly
the
full
volume
of
the
current
he
seized
one
of
the
long
oars
thrust
the
blade
under
the
edge
of
a
thwart
astern
laid
the
shaft
of
the
oar
across
the
cargo
and
by
resting
his
weight
on
the
handle
attempted
to
bring
it
down
to
bind
the
contents
of
the
wanigan
to
their
places
the
cookees
saw
what
he
was
about
and
came
to
his
assistance
together
they
succeeded
in
bending
the
long
hickory
sweep
far
enough
to
catch
its
under
another
forward
thwart
the
second
oar
was
quickly
locked
alongside
the
first
and
not
a
moment
too
soon
a
rush
of
water
forced
them
all
to
cling
for
their
lives
the
poor
old
wanigan
was
almost
buried
by
the
river
but
now
help
was
at
hand
two
or
three
rivermen
appeared
at
the
edge
of
the
chute
a
moment
later
old
man
reed
ran
up
carrying
a
rope
this
after
some
difficulty
was
made
fast
to
the
bow
of
the
wanigan
a
dozen
men
ran
with
the
end
of
it
to
a
position
of
vantage
from
which
they
might
be
able
to
pull
the
bow
away
from
the
sunken
obstruction
but
orde
appearing
above
called
a
halt
after
consultation
with
reed
another
rope
was
brought
and
the
end
of
it
tossed
down
to
the
shipwrecked
crew
orde
pointed
to
the
stern
of
the
boat
revolving
his
hands
in
pantomime
to
show
that
the
wanigan
would
be
apt
to
upset
if
allowed
to
get
when
freed
a
short
rope
led
to
the
top
of
the
dam
allowed
the
bow
to
be
lifted
free
of
the
obstruction
a
cable
astern
prevented
the
current
from
throwing
her
broadside
to
the
rush
of
waters
another
cable
from
the
bow
led
her
in
the
way
she
should
go
ten
minutes
later
she
was
pulled
ashore
out
of
the
eddy
below
very
much
and
manned
by
a
drenched
and
disgruntled
crew
but
orde
allowed
them
little
chance
for
lamentation
luck
he
said
briefly
you
have
lost
much
now
get
a
move
on
you
and
bail
out
you
got
to
get
over
the
shallows
while
this
head
is
all
the
thanks
you
get
grumbled
charlie
to
himself
and
the
other
three
as
orde
moved
away
slave
get
up
in
the
night
drownd
yourself
he
happily
discovered
that
the
pails
under
the
forward
thwart
had
not
been
carried
away
and
all
started
in
to
bail
it
was
a
job
and
consumed
the
greater
part
of
two
hours
even
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
wanigan
though
dry
of
loose
water
floated
but
sluggishly
two
ton
of
water
in
them
and
turkeys
grumbled
charlie
get
at
it
newmark
soon
discovered
that
the
progress
of
the
wanigan
was
looked
upon
in
the
light
of
a
by
the
rivermen
its
appearance
was
signal
for
shouts
of
delighted
and
ironic
encouragement
its
tribulations
which
at
first
in
the
were
many
the
occasion
for
unsympathetic
and
unholy
joy
charlie
looked
on
all
spectators
as
enemies
part
of
the
time
he
merely
glowered
part
of
the
time
he
tried
to
reply
in
kind
to
his
intense
disgust
he
was
taken
seriously
in
neither
case
in
a
couple
of
hours
run
the
wanigan
had
overtaken
and
left
far
behind
the
rear
of
the
drive
all
about
floated
the
logs
caroming
gently
one
against
the
other
shifting
and
changing
the
pattern
of
their
brown
against
the
blue
of
the
water
the
current
flowed
strongly
and
smoothly
but
without
obstruction
everything
went
well
the
banks
slipped
by
silently
and
mysteriously
like
the
unrolling
of
a
panorama
little
strips
of
marshland
stretches
of
woodland
where
the
great
trees
leaned
out
over
the
river
thickets
of
overflowed
swampland
with
the
water
rising
and
draining
among
roots
in
a
strange
regularity
of
its
own
the
sun
shone
warm
there
was
no
wind
newmark
wrung
out
his
outer
garments
and
basked
below
the
gunwale
zeke
and
his
companion
pulled
spasmodically
on
the
sweeps
charlie
having
regained
his
equanimity
together
with
his
old
brown
derby
which
he
came
upon
floating
sodden
in
an
eddy
marched
up
and
down
the
broad
gunwale
with
his
thrusting
away
such
logs
as
threatened
interference
said
he
at
last
better
make
camp
we
be
down
in
the
jam
pretty
the
cookees
abandoned
the
sweeps
in
favour
of
more
by
pushing
and
pulling
on
the
logs
floating
about
them
they
managed
to
work
the
wanigan
in
close
to
the
bank
charlie
a
coil
of
rope
in
his
hand
surveyed
the
prospects
stop
right
down
there
by
that
little
knoll
he
announced
he
leaped
ashore
made
a
turn
around
a
tree
and
braced
himself
to
snub
the
boat
but
unfortunately
he
had
not
taken
into
consideration
the
of
water
soaked
up
by
the
cargo
the
weight
of
the
craft
relentlessly
dragged
him
forward
in
vain
he
braced
and
struggled
the
end
of
the
rope
came
to
the
tree
he
clung
for
a
moment
then
let
go
and
ran
around
the
tree
to
catch
it
before
it
should
slip
into
the
water
by
this
time
the
wanigan
had
caught
the
stronger
current
at
the
bend
and
was
gathering
momentum
charlie
tried
to
snub
at
a
sapling
and
broke
the
sapling
on
a
stub
and
uprooted
the
stub
down
the
banks
and
through
the
brush
he
tore
at
the
end
of
his
rope
clinging
desperately
trying
at
every
solid
tree
to
stop
the
career
of
his
runaway
but
in
every
instance
being
forced
by
the
danger
of
jamming
his
hands
to
let
go
again
he
lost
his
derby
the
landscape
was
a
blur
dimly
he
made
out
the
howls
of
laughter
as
the
outfit
passed
a
group
of
rivermen
then
abruptly
a
ravine
yawned
before
him
and
he
let
go
just
in
time
to
save
himself
a
fall
the
wanigan
trailing
her
rope
drifted
away
nor
did
she
stop
until
she
had
overtaken
the
jam
there
her
momentum
reduced
by
the
closer
crowding
of
the
logs
she
slowed
down
enough
so
that
newmark
and
the
cookees
managed
to
work
her
to
the
bank
and
make
her
fast
that
evening
after
the
wanigan
crew
had
accomplished
a
hard
afternoon
work
pitching
camp
and
drying
blankets
the
first
of
the
rear
drifted
in
very
late
after
a
vain
search
for
camp
farther
up
stream
god
sake
charlie
growled
one
a
wonder
you
would
run
through
to
redding
and
be
done
with
whereupon
charlie
who
had
been
preternaturally
calm
all
the
afternoon
uttered
a
shriek
of
rage
and
with
a
chased
that
man
out
into
the
brush
nor
would
he
be
appeased
to
the
point
of
getting
supper
until
orde
himself
had
intervened
said
orde
to
newmark
later
around
the
campfire
does
strike
you
is
extremely
interesting
replied
newmark
to
join
the
wanigan
crew
permanently
thanks
returned
newmark
drily
stay
with
us
as
long
as
you
having
a
good
time
invited
orde
heartily
but
turning
away
from
his
rather
uncommunicative
visitor
you
newmark
acknowledged
this
believe
i
tommy
called
orde
across
the
fire
to
north
reckon
we
got
to
rustle
some
more
supplies
that
shipwreck
of
ours
mighty
near
cleaned
us
out
of
some
things
lucky
charlie
held
his
head
and
locked
in
the
bedding
with
those
sweeps
or
we
have
been
did
do
it
grumbled
charlie
was
orde
congratulated
newmark
work
i
tickled
to
death
you
belonged
to
that
old
mossback
reed
was
right
on
deck
with
his
rope
remarked
johnny
simms
was
pretty
decent
of
skunk
growled
north
lost
us
two
days
with
his
damn
nonsense
you
let
him
off
too
easy
he
a
poor
old
devil
replied
orde
easily
means
well
enough
that
the
way
the
lord
made
him
he
ca
help
how
he
vi
during
the
days
of
the
drive
newmark
to
the
surprise
of
everybody
stayed
with
the
work
some
of
these
days
were
very
disagreeable
april
rains
are
cold
and
persistent
the
proverbs
as
to
showers
were
made
for
another
latitude
drenched
garments
are
bad
enough
when
a
man
is
moving
about
and
has
daylight
but
when
night
falls
and
the
work
is
over
he
likes
a
dry
place
and
a
change
with
which
to
comfort
himself
dry
places
there
were
none
even
the
interior
of
the
tents
became
sodden
by
continual
exits
and
entrances
of
dripping
men
while
dry
garments
speedily
dampened
in
the
shiftings
of
camp
which
in
the
broader
reaches
of
the
lower
river
took
place
nearly
every
day
men
worked
in
soaked
garments
slept
in
damp
blankets
charlie
cooked
only
by
virtue
of
persistence
the
rivermen
ate
standing
up
as
close
to
the
sputtering
roaring
fires
as
they
could
get
always
the
work
went
forward
but
there
were
other
times
when
a
golden
sun
rose
each
morning
a
little
earlier
on
a
green
and
joyous
world
the
river
ran
blue
migratory
birds
fled
busily
northward
robins
warblers
of
many
species
sparrows
of
different
kinds
shore
birds
and
ducks
the
thrushes
little
tepid
breezes
wandered
up
and
down
warm
in
contrast
to
the
faint
that
even
yet
lingered
in
the
shadows
sounds
carried
clearly
so
that
the
shouts
and
banter
of
the
rivermen
were
plainly
audible
up
the
reaches
of
the
river
ashore
moist
and
aggressive
green
things
were
pushing
up
through
the
watery
earth
from
which
in
shade
the
last
frost
had
not
yet
departed
at
camp
the
fires
roared
invitingly
charlie
grub
was
hot
and
grateful
the
fir
beds
gave
dreamless
sleep
newmark
followed
the
work
of
the
with
great
interest
all
day
long
he
tramped
back
and
forth
on
jam
one
day
on
rear
the
next
he
never
said
much
but
watched
keenly
and
listened
to
the
men
banter
both
on
the
work
and
about
the
evening
fire
as
though
he
enjoyed
it
gradually
the
men
got
used
to
him
and
ceased
to
treat
him
as
an
outsider
his
thin
eager
face
his
inquiring
eyes
behind
the
glasses
his
gray
felt
hat
his
lank
tense
figure
in
its
gray
became
a
familiar
feature
they
threw
remarks
to
him
to
which
he
replied
briefly
and
drily
when
anything
interesting
was
going
on
somebody
told
him
about
it
then
he
hurried
to
the
spot
no
matter
how
distant
it
might
be
he
used
always
the
river
trail
he
never
attempted
to
ride
the
logs
he
seemed
to
depend
most
on
observation
for
he
rarely
asked
any
questions
what
few
queries
he
had
to
proffer
he
made
to
orde
himself
waiting
sometimes
until
evening
to
interview
that
busy
and
individual
then
his
questions
were
direct
and
to
the
point
they
related
generally
to
the
advisability
of
something
he
had
seen
done
only
rarely
did
they
ask
for
explanation
of
the
work
itself
that
newmark
seemed
capable
of
puzzling
out
for
himself
the
drive
as
has
been
said
went
down
as
far
as
redding
in
days
it
had
its
share
of
tribulation
the
men
worked
fourteen
and
sixteen
hours
at
times
several
bad
jams
relieved
the
monotony
three
dams
had
to
be
sluiced
through
problems
of
mechanics
arose
to
be
solved
on
the
spot
problems
that
an
older
civilisation
would
have
attacked
deliberately
and
with
due
respect
for
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
and
the
dignity
of
engineering
orde
solved
them
by
a
but
very
effective
rule
of
thumb
he
built
and
abandoned
structures
which
would
have
furnished
opportunity
for
a
winter
discussion
to
some
committees
just
as
earlier
in
the
work
the
loggers
had
built
through
a
rough
country
some
hundreds
of
miles
of
road
better
than
railroad
grade
solid
in
foundation
and
smooth
as
a
turnpike
the
quarter
of
which
would
have
occupied
the
average
county
board
of
supervisors
for
five
years
and
while
he
was
at
it
orde
kept
his
men
busy
and
satisfied
your
birler
is
not
an
easy
citizen
to
handle
yet
never
once
did
the
boss
appear
hurried
or
flustered
always
he
wandered
about
his
hands
in
his
pockets
chewing
a
twig
his
round
face
puckered
humorously
his
blue
eyes
twinkling
his
square
burly
form
lazily
relaxed
he
seemed
to
meet
his
men
almost
solely
on
the
plane
of
chaffing
yet
the
work
was
done
and
done
efficiently
and
orde
was
the
man
responsible
the
drive
of
which
orde
had
charge
was
to
be
delivered
at
the
booms
of
morrison
and
daly
a
mile
or
so
above
the
city
of
redding
redding
was
a
thriving
place
of
about
thirty
thousand
inhabitants
situated
on
a
long
rapids
some
forty
miles
from
lake
michigan
the
developed
from
the
rapids
explained
redding
existence
most
of
the
logs
floated
down
the
river
were
carried
through
to
the
village
at
the
lake
coast
where
strung
up
the
river
for
eight
or
ten
miles
stood
a
dozen
or
so
big
with
concomitant
booms
yards
and
wharves
morrison
and
daly
however
had
built
a
saw
and
planing
mill
at
redding
where
they
supplied
most
of
the
local
trade
and
that
of
the
surrounding
the
drive
then
was
due
to
break
up
as
soon
as
the
logs
should
be
safely
impounded
the
last
camp
was
made
some
six
or
eight
miles
above
the
mill
from
that
point
a
good
proportion
of
the
rivermen
eager
for
a
taste
of
the
town
tramped
away
down
the
road
to
return
early
in
the
morning
more
or
less
drunk
but
faithful
to
their
job
one
or
two
did
not
return
among
the
revellers
was
the
cook
charlie
commonly
called
the
doctor
the
rivermen
early
worked
off
the
effects
of
their
rather
wild
spree
and
turned
up
at
noon
chipper
as
larks
not
so
the
cook
he
moped
about
disconsolately
all
day
and
in
the
evening
after
his
work
had
been
finished
he
looked
so
much
like
a
chicken
with
the
pip
that
attention
was
attracted
that
taste
charlie
he
inquired
with
mock
solicitude
the
cook
mournfully
shook
his
head
head
let
feel
your
pulse
stick
out
your
tongue
ai
been
drinking
i
tell
you
growled
charlie
expostulated
orde
horrified
course
not
i
hope
none
of
my
boys
ever
take
a
drink
but
that
did
agree
with
your
stomach
now
did
it
charlie
tell
you
i
only
had
two
glasses
of
beer
cried
charlie
goaded
i
can
prove
it
by
johnny
orde
turned
to
survey
the
embarrassed
young
boy
thus
designated
many
glasses
did
johnny
challan
have
he
inquired
did
drink
none
to
speak
of
spoke
up
the
boy
why
this
joyless
demeanour
begged
orde
charlie
grumbled
fiercely
inarticulate
but
johnny
challan
interposed
with
a
chuckle
of
enjoyment
got
us
cried
orde
delightedly
was
down
at
mcneill
place
explained
johnny
challan
encouraged
by
the
interest
of
his
audience
was
a
couple
of
sports
there
who
throwed
out
three
cards
on
the
table
and
bet
you
could
pick
the
jack
they
showed
you
where
the
jack
was
before
they
throwed
and
it
surely
looked
like
a
picnic
but
it
monte
said
newmark
much
asked
simms
fifty
dollars
replied
the
boy
orde
turned
on
the
disgruntled
cook
you
had
fifty
in
your
turkey
camping
with
this
outfit
of
hard
citizens
he
cried
ought
to
lose
johnny
challan
was
explaining
to
his
companions
exactly
how
the
game
was
played
a
case
of
keep
your
eye
on
the
card
i
should
think
said
big
tim
nolan
you
got
a
quick
enough
eye
to
see
him
flip
the
card
around
you
ought
to
be
able
to
pick
what
this
sport
said
agreed
challan
eye
agin
my
hand
says
i
like
to
take
a
try
at
her
mused
tim
but
at
this
point
newmark
broke
into
the
discussion
you
a
pack
of
cards
he
asked
in
his
dry
incisive
manner
somebody
rummaged
in
a
turkey
and
produced
the
remains
of
an
old
deck
do
believe
this
is
a
full
deck
said
he
i
think
they
part
of
two
decks
in
only
want
three
assured
newmark
reaching
his
hand
for
the
pack
the
men
crowded
around
close
those
in
front
squatting
those
behind
looking
over
their
shoulders
newmark
cleared
a
of
drying
socks
and
drew
it
to
him
three
are
the
cards
he
said
speaking
rapidly
is
the
jack
of
hearts
i
pass
my
hands
so
pick
the
jack
one
of
you
he
challenged
leaning
back
from
the
on
which
lay
the
three
cards
back
up
of
you
he
urged
thus
directly
singled
out
the
foreman
leaned
forward
and
rather
hesitatingly
laid
a
blunt
forefinger
on
one
of
the
bits
of
pasteboard
without
a
word
newmark
turned
it
over
it
was
the
ten
of
spades
me
try
interposed
tim
nolan
pressing
his
big
shoulders
forward
bet
i
know
which
it
was
that
time
and
i
bet
i
can
pick
her
next
yes
you
bet
shrugged
newmark
that
where
the
get
you
fellows
every
time
well
pick
it
said
he
again
deftly
flipping
the
cards
nolan
who
had
watched
keenly
indicated
one
without
hesitation
again
it
proved
to
be
the
ten
of
spades
else
ambitious
inquired
newmark
everybody
was
ambitious
and
the
young
man
with
inexhaustible
patience
threw
out
the
cards
the
corners
of
his
mouth
twitching
sardonically
at
each
wrong
guess
at
length
he
called
a
halt
this
time
i
have
had
all
your
money
he
pointed
out
pick
the
for
the
last
time
he
made
his
swift
passes
and
distributed
the
cards
then
quite
calmly
without
disturbing
the
three
on
the
he
held
before
their
eyes
the
jack
of
hearts
an
exclamation
broke
from
the
interested
group
tim
nolan
who
was
the
nearest
leaned
forward
and
turned
over
the
three
on
the
board
they
were
the
eight
of
diamonds
and
two
tens
of
spades
how
the
thing
is
worked
nine
times
out
of
ten
announced
newmark
in
a
while
you
run
against
a
straight
game
but
not
you
showed
us
the
jack
every
time
before
you
throwed
them
puzzled
johnny
simms
of
hand
explained
newmark
simplest
kind
of
charlie
said
big
tim
to
me
as
if
you
had
just
about
as
much
chance
as
a
snowball
in
you
get
onto
doing
all
that
newmark
inquired
north
ai
a
tin
horn
yourself
newmark
laughed
briefly
i
said
he
learned
a
lot
of
those
tricks
from
a
travelling
magician
in
during
this
demonstration
orde
had
sat
well
in
the
background
his
chin
propped
on
his
hand
watching
intently
all
that
was
going
on
after
the
comment
and
exclamations
following
the
exposure
of
the
method
had
subsided
he
spoke
said
he
game
are
you
to
get
charlie
money
back
and
then
some
us
returned
big
tim
game
at
mcneill
and
mcneill
is
a
tough
hole
warned
orde
everything
will
go
peaceful
and
maybe
not
and
you
boys
that
go
with
me
have
got
to
keep
sober
there
is
going
to
be
any
row
unless
i
say
so
and
i
not
taking
any
contract
to
handle
a
lot
of
drunken
as
well
as
go
against
a
right
agreed
nolan
with
the
thirty
or
so
men
of
the
rear
crew
then
in
camp
signified
their
intention
to
stay
by
the
procession
ca
make
those
sharps
disgorge
counselled
newmark
the
first
look
of
trouble
they
will
light
out
they
have
it
all
fixed
force
wo
do
you
much
good
and
may
get
some
of
you
not
going
to
use
force
denied
orde
just
going
to
play
their
game
but
i
bet
i
can
make
it
go
only
i
sort
of
want
the
moral
support
of
the
tell
you
you
ca
win
cried
newmark
disgustedly
a
brace
game
pure
and
do
know
about
it
being
pure
replied
orde
drolly
simple
enough
if
you
know
how
to
make
the
wheels
go
how
is
it
boys
will
you
back
my
play
and
such
was
their
confidence
that
in
face
of
newmark
demonstration
they
said
they
would
vii
after
the
men
had
been
paid
off
perhaps
a
dozen
of
them
hung
around
the
yards
awaiting
evening
and
the
rendezvous
named
by
orde
the
rest
drifted
away
full
of
good
intentions
but
did
not
show
up
again
orde
himself
was
busy
up
to
the
last
moment
but
finally
stamped
out
of
the
office
just
as
the
bell
rang
for
supper
he
surveyed
what
remained
of
his
old
crew
and
grinned
boys
ready
for
trouble
he
greeted
them
they
set
out
up
the
long
reach
of
water
street
their
steel
caulks
biting
deep
into
the
pitted
for
nearly
a
mile
the
street
was
flanked
solely
by
small
mills
and
factories
then
came
a
strip
of
unimproved
land
followed
immediately
by
the
wooden
ramshackle
structures
of
hell
in
the
old
days
every
town
of
any
size
had
its
hell
or
the
equivalent
saginaw
boasted
of
its
catacombs
muskegon
alpena
port
huron
ludington
had
their
rows
streets
and
so
forth
they
supported
row
upon
row
of
saloons
alike
stuffy
and
squalid
gambling
hells
of
all
sorts
refreshment
where
drinks
were
served
by
dozens
of
and
huge
the
proprietors
of
these
places
were
a
bold
and
unscrupulous
lot
in
their
everyday
business
they
had
to
deal
with
the
most
dangerous
fighters
this
country
has
ever
known
with
men
bubbling
over
with
the
joy
of
life
ready
for
quarrel
if
quarrel
also
spelled
fun
drinking
deep
and
and
fearless
in
their
cups
but
each
of
these
rivermen
had
two
or
three
hundred
dollars
to
as
soon
as
possible
the
pickings
were
good
men
got
rich
very
quickly
at
this
business
and
there
existed
this
great
advantage
in
favour
of
the
nobody
cared
what
happened
to
a
riverman
you
could
pound
him
over
the
head
with
a
lead
pipe
or
drug
his
drink
or
choke
him
to
insensibility
or
rob
him
and
throw
him
out
into
the
street
or
even
drop
him
tidily
through
a
into
the
river
flowing
conveniently
beneath
nobody
bothered
unless
of
course
the
affair
was
so
bungled
as
to
become
public
the
police
knew
enough
to
stay
away
when
the
drive
hit
town
they
would
have
been
annihilated
if
they
had
not
the
only
fly
in
the
divekeeper
ointment
was
that
the
riverman
would
fight
back
and
fight
back
he
did
until
from
one
end
of
his
street
to
the
other
he
had
left
the
battered
evidences
of
his
skill
as
a
warrior
his
constant
heavy
lifting
made
him
as
hard
as
nails
and
as
strong
as
a
horse
the
continual
demand
on
his
agility
in
riding
the
logs
kept
him
active
and
prevented
him
from
becoming
in
his
wild
heart
was
not
the
least
trace
of
fear
of
anything
that
walked
crawled
or
flew
and
he
was
as
tireless
as
machinery
and
apparently
as
indifferent
to
punishment
as
a
man
cast
in
iron
add
to
this
a
happy
and
complete
disregard
of
consequences
to
himself
or
others
of
anything
he
did
and
in
his
own
words
he
was
a
man
to
as
yet
the
season
was
too
early
for
much
joy
along
hell
orde
little
crew
and
the
forty
or
fifty
men
of
the
drive
that
had
preceded
him
constituted
the
rank
and
file
at
that
moment
in
town
a
little
later
when
all
the
drives
on
the
river
should
be
in

those
of
its
tributaries

the

still
lingering
at
the
woods
camps
at

five
hundred

would
be
turned
loose
then

awaken
in
earnest
from
its
hibernation

blaze
from

opened
windows

blare
the

the
cries
of

the

and
unashamed

of

down

sidewalks
their

flit
across
the
lit
windows
like
shadows
before
flames
or
stand
in
the
doorways
hailing
the
men
jovially
by

and
every
few
moments
above
the
roar
of
this
wild
inferno
would
sound
the
sudden
crash
and
the
dull
blows
of
combat
only
never
was
heard
the
bark
of
the
pistol
the
fighting
was
fierce
and
it
included
kicking
with
the
sharp
steel
biting
and
gouging
but
it
barred
knives
and
firearms
and
when
hell
was
thus
in
full
eruption

stood
drinking

in
a
sociable
rather
than
a
hilarious
mood
old
friends
of
the
two
drives
were
getting
together
for
a
friendly
glass

barkeepers

listlessly

these
men
knew
that
one
free
drink
would
mean
a
dozen

for
but
the
rivermen
merely
shook
their
heads
sneered
one
of
the
girls

a

of

to

sauntering

a

of
men
were
in

tables
of
cards

under

with
a
great
deal
of
noisy
that
proclaimed

or
ten

wandered
about
idly

loudly
with
the

pausing
to
overlook
the
card
games
glancing
with
purposeless
curiosity
at

professional
gamblers

about

why
you

you
could
pick
out
the

when
i
throw
them
out

that
exclaimed
the
gambler
with
a
pretence
of
disgust
if
you
did
i
bet
you
five
dollars
you
ca
do
it

replied

and

men
augmented
by
the
idlers
not
busy
with
the
card
games
had
drawn
close
into

encouraged
one
whether
it
was
that
the
gamblers
expert
in
the
reading
of
a
man
mood
and
intentions
sensed
the
fact
that
orde
might
be
led
to
plunge
or
whether
more
simply
they
were
using
him
as
a
capper
to
draw
the
crowd
into
their
game
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
but
twice
more
they
bungled
the
throw
and
permitted
him
to
win

plucked
him
at
the
sleeve
twenty
dollars
ahead
he
muttered
it
i
never
saw
anybody
beat
this
game
that
much
orde
merely
shrugged
him
off
with
an
appearance
of
growing
excitement
while
an
habitue
of
the
place
probably
one
of
the
hired
fighters
growled
into
newmark
ear
up
you
damn
dude
warned
this
man
out
of
what
ai
none
of
your
limit
do
you
put
on
this
game
anyway
orde
leaned
forward

eyes
alight
the
two
gamblers
spoke
swiftly
apart

do
you
want
to
bet
asked
one
you
stand
for
five
hundred
dollars
asked
orde
a
dead
silence
fell
on
the
group
plainly
could
be
heard
the
quickened
breathing
the
shouts
and
noise
from
the
card
parties
blundered
through
the
stillness
some
one
tiptoed
across
and
whispered
in
the
ear
of
the
nearest
player
a
moment
later
the
chairs
at
the
two
tables
scraped
back
one
of
them
fell
violently
to
the
floor
their
occupants
joined
the
tense
group
about
the
monte
game
all
the
girls
drew
near
only
behind
the
bar
the
bartenders
wiped
their
glasses
with
apparent
imperturbability
their
eyes
however
on
their
brass
knuckles
hanging
just
beneath
the
counter
their
ears
pricked
up
for
the
riot
call
the
gambler
pretended
to
deliberate
his
cool
shifty
eyes
running
over
the
group
before
him
a
small
door
immediately
behind
him
swung
slowly
ajar
an
inch
or
so
the
money
he
asked
you
countered
orde
apparently
satisfied
the
man
nodded
go
you
bub
if
i
lose
said
he
out
your
orde
counted
out
nine
bills
and
five
tens
probably
no
one
in
the
group
of
men
standing
about
had
realised
quite
how
much
money
five
hundred
dollars
meant
until
they
saw
it
thus
tallied
out
before
them
right
said
the
gambler
taking
up
the
cards
on
cried
orde
yours
that
all
right
the
gambler
reassured
him
with
the
house
i
guess
mcneill
credit
is
good
he
laughed
may
all
be
insisted
orde
i
putting
up
my
good
money
and
i
expect
to
see
good
money
put
up
in
they
wrangled
over
this
point
for
some
time
but
orde
was
obstinate
finally
the
gamblers
yielded
a
canvass
of
the
drawer
helped
out
by
the
bar
and
the
other
games
made
up
the
sum
it
bulked
large
on
the
table
beside
orde
higher
denominations
the
interested
audience
now
consisted
of
the
dozen
men
comprised
by
orde
friends
nearly
twice
as
many
strangers
evidently
rivermen
eight
of
the
joint
probably
fighters
and
half
a
dozen
professional
gamblers
and
several
waitresses
the
four
barkeepers
still
held
their
positions
of
these
the
rivermen
were
scattered
loosely
back
of
orde
although
orde
own
friends
had
by
now
gathered
compactly
enough
at
his
shoulder
the
mercenaries
and
gamblers
had
divided
and
flanked
the
table
at
either
side
newmark
a
growing
wonder
and
disgust
creeping
into
his
usually
unexpressive
face
recognised
the
strategic
advantage
of
this
arrangement
in
case
of
difficulty
a
determined
push
would
separate
the
rivermen
from
the
gamblers
long
enough
for
the
latter
to
disappear
quietly
through
the
small
door
at
the
back
inquired
the
gambler
briefly
her
flicker
replied
orde
with
equal
brevity
a
gasp
of
anticipation
went
up
quite
coolly
the
gambler
made
his
passes
with
equal
coolness
and
not
the
slightest
hesitation
orde
planted
his
great
red
fist
on
one
of
the
cards
is
the
jack
he
announced
looking
the
gambler
in
the
eye
is
it
sneered
the
dealer
turn
it
over
and
let
roared
orde
turn
over
the
other
two
a
low
oath
broke
from
the
gambler
and
his
face
contorted
in
a
spasm
the
barkeepers
slid
out
from
behind
the
bar
for
a
moment
the
situation
was
tense
and
threatening
the
dealer
with
a
sweeping
glance
again
searched
the
faces
of
those
before
him
in
that
moment
probably
he
made
up
his
mind
that
an
open
scandal
must
be
avoided
force
and
broken
bones
even
murder
might
be
all
right
enough
under
colour
of
right
if
orde
had
turned
up
for
a
jack
the
card
on
which
he
now
held
his
fist
and
then
had
attempted
to
prove
cheating
a
cry
of
robbery
and
a
lively
fight
would
have
given
opportunity
for
making
way
with
the
stakes
but
mcneill
could
not
afford
to
be
shown
up
before
thirty
interested
rivermen
as
running
an
however
the
gambler
made
a
desperate
try
at
what
he
must
have
known
was
a
very
forlorn
hope

the
way
this
game
is
played
said
he
up
your
the
way
i
play
it
replied
orde
sternly
gentlemen
heard
the
he
reached
over
and
dexterously
flipped
over
the
other
two
cards
see
neither
of
these
is
the
jack
this
must
win
assented
the
gambler
after
a
pause
orde
his
fist
still
on
the
third
card
began
pocketing
the
stakes
with
the
other
hand
the
gambler
reached
palm
up
across
the
table
me
the
other
card
said
he
orde
picked
it
up
laughing
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
hesitate
holding
the
bit
of
pasteboard
tantalisingly
outstretched
as
though
he
were
going
to
turn
also
this
one
face
up
then
quite
deliberately
he
looked
to
right
and
to
left
where
the
fighters
awaited
their
signal
laughed
again
and
handed
the
card
to
the
gambler
at
once
pandemonium
broke
loose
the
rivermen
of
orde
party
fairly
shouted
with
joy
over
the
unexpected
trick
the
employees
of
the
resort
whispered
apart
the
gambler
explained
and
angry
his
reasons
for
not
putting
up
a
fight
for
so
rich
a
stake
to
the
bar
yelled
orde
they
made
a
rush
and
lined
up
and
ordered
their
drinks

poured
his
on
the
floor
and
took
the
glass

get

thinking
you
the
worst
fool
i
ever

but
you
can
take
care
of
yourself
at

stage
of

the
trick
was
good

beat
viii
orde
heard
no
more
of

and
hardly
thought
of
him
until
over
two
weeks
later
in
the
meantime
the
riverman
assuming
the
more
conventional
garments
of
civilisation
lived
with
his
parents
in
the
old
orde
homestead
at
the
edge
of
town
this
was
a
rather
pretentious
brick
structure
in
the
old
solid
square
architecture
surrounded
by
a
small
orchard
some
hickories
and
a
garden
orde
father
had
built
it
when
he
arrived
in
the
pioneer
country
from
new
england
forty
years
before
at
that
time
it
was
considered
well
out
in
the
country
since
then
the
town
had
crept
to
it
so
that
the
row
of
grand
old
maples
in

shaded
a
street
a
little
patch
of
corn

still
vacant
lots

diverse
cities
and
industries

big
echoing

the
one

the
servant
grandpa

now
above
sixty
was
tall
straight
slender
his
hair
was
quite
white
and
worn
a
little
long
his
features
were
finely
chiselled
and
aquiline
from
them
looked
a
pair
of
piercing
young
black
eyes
in
his
time
grandpa
orde
had
been
a
mighty
breaker
of
the
wilderness
but
his
time
had
passed
and
with
the
advent
of
a
more
intensive
civilisation
he
had
fallen
upon
somewhat
straitened
ways
grandma
orde
on
the
other

was
a
very
small
spry
old
lady
with
a
small
face
a
small
figure
small
hands
and
feet
she
dressed
in
the
then
usual
cap
and
black
silk
of
old
ladies
half
her
time
she
spent
at
her
housekeeping
which
she
loved
jingling
about
from
cellar
to
attic
seeing
that
amanda

everything
in
order
the

sat
in
a
wooden
by
a
window
overlooking
the
garden
her
feet
rested
neatly

on
a
hassock

a
canary
and
the
interior
of
the
house
itself
was
in
keeping
the
low
ceilings
the
slight
irregularities
of
structure
peculiar
to
the
rather
methods
of
the
earlier
builders
the
deep
window
embrasures
due
to
the
thickness
of
the
walls
the
unexpected
passages
leading
to
unsuspected
rooms
and
the
fact
that
many
of
these
apartments
were
approached
by
a
step
or
so
up
or
a
step
or
so
down
these
lent
to
it
a
quaint
atmosphere
enhanced
further
by
the
steel
engravings
the
antique
furnishings
the
windows
and
all
the
belongings
of
old
people
who
have
passed
from
a
previous
generation
untouched
by
modern
ideas
to
this
house
and
these
people

came
direct
from
the
greatness
of
the
wilderness
and
the
ferocity
of
hell
such
contrasts

possible

ten
or
fifteen
years
ago

untamed
country

at
the
doors
of
the
most
modern
civilisation
newmark
reappearing
one
sunday
afternoon
at
the
end
of
the
two
weeks
was
apparently
bothered
he
examined
the
orde
place
for
some
moments
walked
on
beyond
it
finding
nothing
there
he
returned
and
after
some
hesitation
turned
in
up
the
tar
sidewalk
and
pulled
at
the
wire
grandma
orde
herself
answered
the
door
at
sight
of
her
fine
features
her
dainty
lace
cap
and
mitts
and
the
stiffness
of
her
rustling
black
silks
newmark
took
off
his
gray
felt
hat
said
he
you
kindly
tell
me
where
orde
lives
is
orde
replied
the
little
old
lady
me
persisted
newmark
am
looking
for
jack
orde
and
i
was
directed
here
i
am
sorry
to
have
troubled
jack
orde
lives
here
returned
grandma
orde
is
my
son
would
you
like
to
see
him
you
please
assented
newmark
gravely
his
thin
shrewd
face
masking
itself
with
its
usual
expression
of
quizzical
cynicism
this
way
please
and
i
call
him
requested
his
interlocutor
standing
aside
from
the
doorway
newmark
entered
the
cool
dusky
interior
and
was
shown
to
the
left
into
a
dim
long
room
he
perched
on
a
mahogany
chair
and
had
time
to
notice
the
bookcases
with
the
white
owl
atop
the
old
piano
with
the
yellowing
keys
the
haircloth
sofa
and
chairs
the
steel
engravings
and
the
two
oil
portraits
when
orde
large
figure
darkened
the
door
for
an
instant
the
young
man
who
must
just
have
come
in
from
the
outside
sunshine
blinked
into
the
dimness
newmark
too
blinked
back
although
he
could
by
this
time
see
perfectly
well
newmark
had
known
orde
only
as
a
riverman
like
most
easterners
then
and
now
he
was
unable
to
imagine
a
man
in
rough
clothes
as
being
anything
but
essentially
a
rough
man
the
figure
he
saw
before
him
was
decently
and
correctly
dressed
in
what
was
then
the
proper
sunday
costume
his
big
figure
set
off
the
cloth
to
advantage
and
even
his
face
seemed
toned
down
and
refined
by
the
change
in
costume
and
surroundings
it
you
newmark
cried
orde
in
his
hearty
way
and
holding
out
his
hand
glad
to
see
you
where
you
been
come
on
out
of
there
this
is
the
place
without
awaiting
a
reply
he
led
the
way
into
the
narrow
hall
whence
the
two
entered
another
brighter
room
in
which
grandma
orde
sat
the
canary
singing
above
her
head
said
orde
is
newmark
who
was
with
us
on
the
drive
this
grandma
orde
laid
her
glasses
and
her
black
leather
bible
on
the
stand
beside
her
newmark
and
i
spoke
at
the
door
said
she
extending
her
frail
hand
with
dignity
you
were
on
the
drive
newmark
you
must
have
been
one
of
the
high
privates
in
this
dreadful
war
we
all
read
newmark
laughed
and
made
some
appropriate
reply
a
few
moments
later
at
orde
suggestion
the
two
passed
out
a
side
door
and
back
into
the
remains
of
the
old
orchard
pretty
nice
here
under
the
trees
said
orde
down
and
light
up
where
you
been
for
the
last
couple
of
weeks
caught
johnson
drive
and
went
on
down
river
with
him
to
the
lake
replied
newmark
thrusting
the
offered
cigar
in
one
corner
of
his
mouth
and
shaking
his
head
at
orde
proffer
of
a
light
must
like
camp
do
not
like
it
at
all
negatived
newmark
emphatically
the
drive
interested
me
it
interested
me
so
much
that
i
come
back
to
talk
to
you
about
ahead
acquiesced
orde
going
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
about
yourself
and
you
can
answer
them
or
not
just
as
you
i
not
bashful
about
my
career
laughed
orde
old
are
you
inquired
newmark
abruptly
long
have
you
been
doing
that
sort
of
thing
driving
i
mean
and
on
about
six
did
you
go
into
that
particular
sort
of
thing
orde
selected
a
twig
and
carefully
threw
it
at
a
lump
in
the
turf
there
nothing
ahead
of
shovelling
but
dirt
he
replied
with
a
quaint
grin
see
said
newmark
after
a
pause
you
think
there
more
future
to
that
sort
of
thing
than
the
sort
of
thing
the
rest
of
your
friends
go
in
for
law
and
wholesale
groceries
and
banking
and
the
rest
of
it
is
for
me
replied
orde
simply
you
merely
on
a
salary
at
orde
flushed
slowly
and
shifted
his
position
so
district
attorney
he
said
drily
newmark
started
from
his
absorption
in
his
questioning
and
shifted
his
unlighted
cigar
sound
like
it
he
admitted
i
not
asking
all
this
out
of
idle
curiosity
i
got
a
scheme
in
my
head
that
i
think
may
work
out
big
for
us
assented
orde
reservedly
that
case
i
foreman
on
this
drive
because
my
outfit
went
kerplunk
two
years
ago
and
i
making
a
fresh
go
at
inquired
newmark
skedaddled
replied
orde
if
you
satisfied
with
my
family
history
suppose
you
tell
me
what
the
devil
you
driving
he
was
plainly
restive
under
the
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
here
said
newmark
abruptly
changing
the
subject
know
that
rapids
up
river
flanked
by
shallows
where
the
logs
are
always
going
aground
do
replied
orde
still
grim
why
would
it
help
to
put
a
string
of
piers
down
both
sides
with
booms
between
them
to
hold
the
logs
in
the
deeper
water
would
said
orde
is
it
done
then
would
do
it
countered
orde
leaning
back
more
easily
in
the
interest
of
this
new
discussion
daly
did
it
for
instance
then
all
the
rest
of
the
drivers
would
get
the
advantage
of
it
for
them
to
pay
their
orde
grinned
like
to
see
you
get
any
three
men
to
agree
to
anything
on
this
a
sort
of
dam
would
help
at
that
spruce
rapids
if
you
improved
the
river
for
driving
she
be
easier
to
drive
that
goes
without
many
firms
drive
logs
on
this
stream
replied
orde
without
hesitation
many
men
do
they
employ
asked
orde
five
hundred
a
few
more
or
suppose
newmark
leaned
forward
impressively
a
firm
should
be
organised
to
drive
all
the
logs
on
the
river
suppose
it
improved
the
river
with
necessary
piers
dams
and
all
the
rest
of
it
so
that
the
driving
would
be
easier
could
it
drive
with
less
than
five
hundred
men
and
could
it
save
money
on
the
cost
of
driving
might
agreed
orde
know
the
conditions
here
if
such
a
firm
should
be
organised
and
should
offer
to
drive
the
logs
for
these
ten
firms
at
so
much
a
thousand
do
you
suppose
it
would
get
the
business
would
depend
on
the
driving
firm
said
orde
see
mill
men
have
got
to
have
their
logs
they
ca
afford
to
take
chances
it
would
that
all
right
agreed
newmark
with
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
across
his
thin
face
you
form
a
partnership
with
me
having
such
an
object
in
view
orde
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
with
genuine
amusement
guess
you
do
realise
the
situation
said
he
have
to
have
a
few
little
things
like
distributing
booms
and
tugs
and
a
lot
of
tools
and
supplies
and
works
of
various
we
get
it
was
now
orde
turn
to
ask
questions
much
are
you
worth
he
inquired
bluntly
twenty
thousand
dollars
replied
newmark
if
i
raise
very
much
more
than
twenty
thousand
cents
i
lucky
just
much
capital
would
we
have
to
have
asked
newmark
orde
thought
for
several
minutes
twisting
the
petal
of
an
old
between
his
strong
blunt
fingers
near
thousand
dollars
he
estimated
at
last
easy
cried
newmark
make
a
stock
company
say
a
hundred
thousand
shares
we
keep
just
enough
between
us
to
control
the
company
say
thousand
i
put
in
my
pile
and
you
can
pay
for
yours
out
of
the
earnings
of
the
does
sound
fair
objected
orde
pay
interest
explained
newmark
we
sell
the
rest
of
the
stock
to
raise
the
rest
of
the
we
can
interjected
orde
think
we
can
asserted
newmark
orde
fell
into
a
brown
study
occasionally
throwing
a
twig
or
a
particle
of
earth
at
the
offending
lump
in
the
turf
overhead
the
migratory
warblers
balanced
up
or
down
searching
busily
among
the
new
leaves
uttering
their
simple
calls
the
air
was
warm
and
soft
and
still
the
sky
bright
fat
hens
clucked
among
the
grasses
a
feel
of
sunday
was
in
the
air
must
have
something
to
live
on
said
he
thoughtfully
at
last
must
i
said
newmark
have
to
pay
ourselves
salaries
of
course
but
the
smaller
the
better
at
first
you
have
to
take
charge
of
the
men
and
the
work
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
do
know
anything
about
that
i
attend
to
the
incorporating
and
the
routine
and
try
to
place
the
stock
you
have
to
see
first
of
all
whether
you
can
get
contracts
from
the
logging
firms
to
drive
the
can
i
tell
what
to
charge
them
have
to
figure
that
very
closely
you
know
where
these
different
drives
would
start
from
and
how
long
each
of
them
would
take
yes
i
know
the
river
pretty
then
we
figure
how
many
days
driving
there
is
for
each
and
how
many
men
there
are
and
what
it
costs
for
wages
grub
tools
just
have
to
figure
as
near
as
we
can
to
the
actual
cost
and
then
add
a
margin
for
profit
and
for
interest
on
our
might
work
out
all
right
admitted
orde
confident
it
would
asserted
newmark
there
be
no
harm
figuring
it
all
out
would
there
agreed
orde
would
be
fun
all
at
this
moment
amanda
appeared
at
the
back
door
and
waved
an
apron
jack
she
called
in
to
newmark
looked
puzzled
and
as
he
arose
glanced
surreptitiously
at
his
watch
orde
seemed
to
take
the
summons
as
one
to
be
expected
however
in
fact
the
strange
hour
was
the
usual
sunday
custom
in
the
redding
of
that
day
and
had
to
do
with
the
freedom
of
amanda
and
her
like
in
and
eat
with
us
invited
orde
be
glad
to
have
but
newmark
declined
up
night
then
at
six
for
supper
orde
urged
him
can
figure
on
these
things
a
little
i
in
daly
all
day
and
hardly
have
time
except
to
this
newmark
assented
orde
walked
with
him
down
the
driveway
with
the
clipped
privet
hedge
on
one
side
to
the
iron
gate
that
swung
open
when
one
drove
over
a
projecting
lever
there
he
said
a
moment
later
he
entered
the
long
where
grandpa
and
grandma
orde
were
already
seated

service
of
smooth
silver
and
steel
knives

dropped
into
his
place
with
satisfaction
up

remarked
to
a
frantic
canary
hanging
in
the
sunshine

a
young
man
said
grandma

to
dinner
asked
him
replied
orde
he
could

i
have
a
scheme
for
making
our
everlasting

he
asked
grandma
orde
dropped
his
napkin
into
his
lap
with
a
comical
chuckle
of
dismay
if
i
have
the
slightest
idea
mother
he
said

us
on
the
drive
said
he
was
a
lawyer
and
was
out
in
the
woods
for
his
health

with
us
studying
and
watching
the
work
ever
ix
think
i
go
see
jane
hubbard
this
evening
orde
remarked
to
his
mother
as
he
arose
from
the
table
this
was
his
method
of
announcing
that
he
would
not
be
home
for
supper
jane
hubbard
lived
in
a
low
house
of
blue
granite
situated
amid
a
grove
of
oaks
at
the
top
of
the
hill
she
was
a
kindly
girl
whose
parents
gave
her
free
swing
and
whose
house
in
consequence
was
popular
with
the
younger
people
every
sunday
she
offered
to
all
who
came
a
lunch
which
consisted
of
cold
meats
cold
salad
bread
butter
cottage
cheese
jam
preserves
and
the
like
warmed
by
a
cup
of
excellent
tea
these
refreshments
were
served
by
the
guests
themselves
it
did
not
much
matter
how
few
or
how
many
came
on
the
sunday
evening
in
question
orde
found
about
the
usual
crowd
gathered
jane
herself
tall
deliberate
in
movement
and
in
speech
kindly
and
thoughtful
talked
in
a
corner
with
ernest
colburn
who
was
just
out
of
college
and
who
worked
in
a
bank
mignonne
smith
a
plump
rather
pretty
little
body
with
a
tremendous
aureole
of
hair
like
spun
golden
fire
was
trying
to
balance
a
on
the
end
of
a
ruler
the
ball
regularly
fell
off
three
young
men
standing
in
attentive
attitudes
thereupon
dove
forward
in
an
attempt
to
catch
it
before
it
should
hit
the
floor
which
it
generally
did
with
a
loud
thump
a
collapsed
chair
of
slender
lines
stacked
against
the
wall
attested
previous
acrobatics
this
much
orde
standing
in
the
doorway
looked
upon
quite
as
the
usual
thing
only
he
missed
the
incubus
searching
the
room
with
his
eyes
he
at
length
discovered
that
incoherent
desiccated
but
persistent
youth
with
a
stranger
orde
made
out
the
white
of
her
gown
in
the
shadows
the
willowy
outline
of
her
small
and
slender
figure
and
the
gracious
forward
bend
of
her
head
the
company
present
caught
sight
of
orde
standing
in
the
doorway
and
suspended
occupations
to
shout
at
him
joyfully
he
was
evidently
a
favourite
the
strange
girl
in
the
corner
turned
to
him
a
white
long
face
of
which
he
could
see
only
the
outline
and
the
redness
of
the
lips
where
the
lamplight
reached
them
she
leaned
slightly
forward
and
the
lips
parted
orde
muscular
figure
standing
square
and
uncompromising
in
the
doorway
the
freshness
of
his
complexion
the
steadiness
of
his
eyes
laughing
back
a
greeting
had
evidently
attracted
her
or
perhaps
anything
was
a
relief
from
the
incubus
you
back
at
last
are
you
jack
drawled
jane
in
her
lazy
way
and
meet
miss
bishop
carroll
i
want
to
present
orde
bowed
ceremoniously
into
the
penumbra
cast
by
the
lamp
broad
shade
the
girl
inclined
gracefully
her
small
head
with
the
glossy
hair
the
incubus
his
thin
hands
clasped
on
his
knee
his
sallow
face
twisted
in
one
of
its
customary
wry
smiles
held
to
the
edge
of
his
chair
with
characteristic
pertinacity
walter
orde
addressed
him
genially
you
having
a
good
time
replied
the
incubus
as
though
it
were
one
word
his
chair
was
planted
squarely
to
exclude
all
others
orde
surveyed
the
situation
with
to
keep
the
other
fellow
from
getting
a
chance
i
replied
the
incubus
orde
bent
over
and
with
great
ease
lifted
incubus
chair
and
all
and
set
him
facing
mignonne
smith
and
the
mignonne
said
he
brought
you
another
he
returned
to
the
lamp
to
find
the
girl
her
dark
eyes
alight
with
amusement
watching
him
intently
she
held
the
tip
of
a
closed
fan
against
her
lips
which
brought
her
head
slightly
forward
in
an
attitude
as
though
she
listened
somehow
there
was
about
her
an
air
of
poise
of
absolute
balanced
repose
quite
different
from
jane
rather
awkward
statics
and
in
direct
contrast
to
mignonne
dynamics
is
a
very
bright
man
in
his
own
line
said
orde
swinging
forward
a
chair
he
must
be
allowed
any
do
you
know
i
want
him
so
summarily
removed
the
girl
asked
him
without
changing
either
her
graceful
attitude
of
suspended
motion
or
the
intentness
of
her
gaze
argued
orde
got
him
to
say
all
he
ever
says
to
any
girl
so
you
could
have
any
more
conversation
from
him
if
you
want
to
look
at
him
why
there
he
is
in
plain
sight
besides
i
want
to
talk
to
you
you
always
get
what
you
want
inquired
the
girl
orde
laughed
one
can
get
anything
he
wants
if
only
he
wants
it
bad
enough
he
asserted
the
girl
pondered
this
for
a
moment
and
finally
lowered
and
opened
her
fan
and
threw
back
her
head
in
a
more
relaxed
attitude
people
she
amended
i
forgive
you
i
will
even
flatter
you
by
saying
i
am
glad
you
came
you
look
to
have
reached
the
age
of
discretion
i
venture
to
say
that
these
boys
idea
of
a
lively
evening
is
to
throw
bread
about
the
orde
flushed
a
little
the
last
time
he
had
supped
at
jane
hubbard
that
was
exactly
what
they
did
do
are
young
of
course
he
said
you
and
i
are
very
old
and
wise
but
having
a
noisy
good
time
is
such
a
great
crime
or
is
it
where
you
came
from
the
girl
leaned
forward
a
sparkle
of
interest
in
her
eyes
you
and
i
going
to
fight
she
demanded
depends
on
you
returned
orde
squarely
but
with
perfect
they
eyed
each
other
a
moment
then
the
girl
closed
her
fan
and
leaned
forward
to
touch
him
on
the
arm
with
it
are
quite
right
not
to
allow
me
to
say
mean
things
about
your
friends
and
i
am
a
nasty
little
orde
bowed
with
sudden
gravity
they
do
throw
bread
said
he
they
both
laughed
she
leaned
back
with
a
movement
of
satisfaction
seeming
to
sink
into
the
shadows
tell
me
what
do
you
do
do
i
do
asked
orde
puzzled
everybody
does
something
out
west
here
it
a
disgrace
not
to
do
something
is
it
my
business
i
a
just
she
repeated
once
more
leaning
forward
just
been
hearing
a
great
deal
about
so
he
inquired
from
said
orde
you
know
what
a
drunken
swearing
worthless
lot
of
bums
and
toughs
we
are
do
you
for
the
first
time
in
some
subtle
way
she
broke
the
poise
of
her
attitude
is
hell
she
reminded
him
yes
said
orde
bitterly
hell
whose
fault
is
that
my
rivermen
my
boys
look
here
i
suppose
you
understand
it
if
you
tried
a
month
but
suppose
you
were
working
out
in
the
woods
nine
months
of
the
year
up
early
in
the
morning
and
in
late
at
night
suppose
you
slept
in
rough
blankets
on
the
ground
or
in
bunks
ate
rough
food
never
saw
a
woman
or
a
book
undertook
work
to
scare
your
city
men
up
a
tree
and
into
a
hole
too
easy
risked
your
life
a
dozen
times
a
week
in
a
tangle
of
logs
with
the
big
river
roaring
behind
just
waiting
to
swallow
you
saw
nothing
but
woods
and
river
were
cold
and
hungry
and
wet
and
so
tired
you
could
wiggle
until
you
got
to
feeling
like
the
thing
was
never
going
to
end
and
until
you
got
sick
of
it
way
through
in
spite
of
the
excitement
and
danger
and
then
suppose
you
hit
town
where
there
were
all
the
things
you
had
and
the
first
thing
you
struck
was
hell
say
seen
water
behind
a
jam
have
you
a
good
thing
in
a
mill
course
where
it
has
wheels
to
turn
but
behind
a
jam
it
just
rips
things
oh
what
the
use
talking
a
girl
does
know
what
it
means
she
could
he
broke
off
with
an
impatient
gesture
she
was
looking
at
him
intently
her
lips
again
think
i
begin
to
understand
a
little
said
she
softly
she
smiled
to
herself
they
are
a
hard
and
heartless
class
in
spite
of
all
their
energy
and
courage
are
they
she
drew
him
out
and
heartless
exploded
orde
no
kinder
lot
of
men
on
earth
let
me
tell
you
why
there
is
a
man
on
that
river
who
chip
in
five
or
ten
dollars
when
a
man
is
hurt
or
killed
and
that
means
three
or
four
days
hard
work
for
him
and
he
may
not
know
or
like
the
injured
man
at
all
why
all
the
excitement
drawled
jane
hubbard
behind
them
you
make
it
a
we
chimed
in
the
incubus
the
company
trooped
out
to
the
where
the
table
spread
with
all
the
good
things
awaited
them
you
light
the
candles
drawled
jane
drifting
slowly
along
the
table
with
her
eye
on
the
arrangements
some
of
you
boys
go
get
the
butter
and
the
from
the
to
orde
relief
no
one
threw
any
bread
although
the
fun
grew
boisterous
enough
before
the
close
of
the
meal
miss
bishop
sat
directly
across
from
him
he
had
small
chance
of
conversation
with
her
in
the
hubbub
that
raged
but
he
gained
full
leisure
to
examine
her
more
closely
in
the
fuller
illumination
throughout
her
note
was
of
fineness
her
hands
as
he
had
already
noticed
were
long
the
fingers
tapering
her
wrists
were
finely
moulded
but
slender
and
running
without
abrupt
swelling
of
muscles
into
the
long
lines
of
her
forearm
her
figure
was
rounded
but
built
on
the
curves
of
slenderness
her
piled
glossy
hair
was
so
fine
that
though
it
was
full
of
wonderful
soft
shadows
denied
coarser
tresses
its
mass
hardly
did
justice
to
its
abundance
her
face
again
was
long
and
oval
with
a
peculiar
transparence
to
the
skin
and
a
peculiar
faint
healthy
circulation
of
the
blood
well
below
the
surface
which
relieved
her
complexion
of
pallor
but
did
not
give
her
a
colour
the
lips
on
the
contrary
were
satin
red
and
orde
was
mildly
surprised
after
his
recent
talk
to
find
them
sensitively
moulded
and
with
a
quaint
quirk
at
the
corners
her
eyes
were
rather
contemplative
and
so
black
as
to
resemble
spots
in
spite
of
her
references
to
she
joined
with
evident
pleasure
in
the
badinage
and
more
practical
fun
which
struck
the
note
of
the
supper
only
orde
thought
to
discern
even
in
her
more
boisterous
movements
a
graceful
courteous
restraint
to
catch
in
the
bend
of
her
head
a
dainty
concession
to
the
joy
of
the
moment
to
hear
in
the
tones
of
her
laughter
a
reservation
of
herself
which
nevertheless
was
not
at
all
a
reservation
against
the
others
after
the
meal
was
finished
each
had
his
candle
to
blow
out
and
then
all
returned
to
the
parlour
leaving
the
debris
for
the
later
attention
of
the
orde
with
determination
made
his
way
to
miss
bishop
side
she
smiled
at
him
see
i
am
a
hypocrite
as
well
as
a
mean
little
snip
said
she
threw
a
little
bread
bread
repeated
orde
did
see
moon
is
made
of
green
cheese
she
mocked
him
there
are
countries
where
men
heads
do
grow
beneath
their
she
moved
gracefully
away
toward
jane
hubbard
you
western
never
deal
in
figures
of
speech
as
well
as
figures
of
the
other
sort
she
wafted
back
to
him
over
her
shoulder
was
very
stupid
acknowledged
orde
following
her
she
stopped
and
faced
him
in
the
middle
of
the
room
smiling
quizzically
she
challenged
what
asked
orde
puzzled
thought
perhaps
you
wanted
to
ask
me
following
me
she
explained
the
corners
of
her
mouth
smiling
had
turned
away
just
wanted
to
talk
to
you
said
orde
you
always
get
what
you
want
she
repeated
she
conceded
with
a
shrug
of
mock
resignation
but
the
four
other
men
here
cut
in
with
a
demand
they
clamoured
want
music
with
a
nod
miss
bishop
turned
to
the
piano
sweeping
aside
her
white
draperies
as
she
sat
she
struck
a
few
soft
chords
and
then
her
long
hands
wandering
idly
and
softly
up
and
down
the
keys
she
smiled
at
them
over
her
shoulder
shall
it
be
she
inquired
some
one
thrust
an
open
on
the
rack
in
front
of
her
the
others
gathered
close
about
leaning
forward
to
see
song
followed
song
at
first
quickly
then
at
longer
intervals
at
last
the
members
of
the
chorus
dropped
away
one
by
one
to
occupations
of
their
own
the
girl
still
sat
at
the
piano
her
head
thrown
back
idly
her
hands
wandering
softly
in
and
out
of
melodies
and
modulations
watching
her
orde
finally
saw
only
the
shimmer
of
her
white
figure
and
the
white
outline
of
her
head
and
throat
all
the
rest
of
the
room
was
gray
from
the
concentration
of
his
gaze
at
last
her
hands
fell
in
her
lap
she
sat
looking
straight
ahead
of
her
orde
at
once
arose
and
came
to
her
was
a
wonderfully
quaint
and
beautiful
thing
said
he
was
it
she
turned
to
him
and
he
saw
that
the
mocking
had
gone
from
her
eyes
and
mouth
leaving
them
quite
simple
like
a
child
you
like
it
she
asked
said
orde
he
hesitated
and
stammered
awkwardly
was
so
still
and
soothing
it
made
me
think
of
the
river
sometimes
about
dusk
what
was
it
was
anything
i
was
made
it
up
yourself
was
myself
i
suppose
i
love
to
build
myself
a
garden
and
wander
on
until
i
lose
myself
in
it
i
glad
there
was
a
river
in
the
garden
a
nice
still
twilight
she
flashed
up
at
him
her
head
sidewise
is
she
struck
a
crashing
discord
on
the
piano
every
one
looked
up
at
the
sudden
noise
of
it
do
stop
they
cried
in
chorus
as
though
each
had
been
listening
intently
the
girl
laughed
up
at
orde
in
amusement
somehow
this
flash
of
an
especial
understanding
between
them
to
the
exclusion
of
the
others
sent
a
warm
glow
to
his
heart
do
wish
you
had
your
harp
here
said
jane
hubbard
coming
indolently
forward
just
ought
to
hear
her
play
the
harp
she
told
the
rest
just
the
best
thing
you
ever
did
hear
at
this
moment
the
outside
door
opened
to
admit
mr
and
hubbard
who
had
according
to
their
usual
sunday
custom
been
spending
the
evening
with
a
neighbour
this
was
the
signal
for
departure
the
company
began
to
break
up
orde
pushed
his
broad
shoulders
in
to
screen
carroll
bishop
from
the
others
you
staying
here
he
asked
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
at
his
brusqueness
visiting
jane
she
replied
at
length
with
an
affectation
of
demureness
you
going
to
be
here
long
was
orde
next
question
a
am
coming
to
see
you
announced
orde
he
took
her
hand
dropped
it
and
followed
the
others
into
the
hall
leaving
her
standing
by
the
lamp
she
watched
him
until
the
outer
door
had
closed
behind
him
not
once
did
he
look
back
jane
hubbard
returning
after
a
moment
from
the
hall
found
her
at
the
piano
again
her
head
slightly
one
side
playing
with
painful
and
accurate
exactness
a
simple
melody
orde
walked
home
down
the
hill
in
company
with
the
incubus
neither
had
anything
to
say
orde
because
he
was
absorbed
in
thought
the
incubus
because
nothing
occurred
to
draw
from
him
his
one
remark
their
feet
clipped
sharply
against
the
tar
walks
or
rang
more
hollow
on
the
boards
overhead
the
stars
twinkled
through
the
branches
of
the
trees
with
few
exceptions
the
houses
were
dark
people
early
in
redding
an
occasional
hall
light
burned
dimly
awaiting
some
one
return
at
the
gate
of
the
orde
place
orde
roused
himself
to
say
he
let
himself
into
the
hall
hung
up
his
hat
and
turned
out
the
gas
for
some
time
he
stood
in
the
dark
quite
motionless
then
with
the
accuracy
of
long
habitude
he
walked
confidently
to
the
narrow
stairs
and
ascended
them
subconsciously
he
avoided
the
creaking
step
but
outside
his
mother
door
he
stopped
arrested
by
a
greeting
from
within
you
jack
queried
grandma
orde
for
answer
orde
pushed
open
the
door
which
stood
an
inch
or
so
ajar
and
entered
a
dim
light
from
a
distant
filtered
through
the
branches
of
a
tree
flickered
against
the
ceiling
by
its
aid
he
made
out
the
great
square
bed
and
divined
the
tiny
figure
of
his
mother
he
seated
himself
sidewise
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
to
jane
queried
grandma
in
a
low
voice
to
avoid
awakening
grandpa
who
slept
in
the
adjoining
room
replied
orde
in
the
same
tone
was
there
about
the
usual
he
fell
into
an
abstracted
silence
which
endured
for
several
minutes
said
he
abruptly
at
last
met
the
girl
i
want
for
my
grandma
orde
sat
up
in
bed
is
she
she
demanded
name
is
carroll
bishop
said
orde
she
visiting
jane
but
who
is
she
insisted
grandma
orde
is
she
from
orde
stared
at
her
in
the
dim
light
mother
he
repeated
for
the
second
time
that
day
if
i
know
that
x
orde
was
up
and
out
at
six
the
following
morning
by
eight
he
had
reported
for
work
at
daly
mill
where
with
the
assistance
of
a
portion
of
the
river
crew
he
was
occupied
in
sorting
the
logs
in
the
booms
not
until
six
in
the
evening
did
the
whistle
blow
for
the
then
he
hastened
home
to
find
that
newmark
had
preceded
him
by
some
few
moments
and
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
grandma
orde
the
young
man
was
talking
easily
though
rather
precisely
and
with
brevity
he
nodded
to
orde
and
finished
his
remark
after
supper
orde
led
the
way
up
two
flights
of
narrow
stairs
to
his
own
room
this
was
among
the
gables
a
chamber
of
strangely
diversified
ceiling
which
slanted
here
and
there
according
to
the
demands
of
the
roof
outside
said
he
made
up
my
mind
to
go
in
with
you
it
may
not
work
out
but
it
a
good
chance
and
i
want
to
get
in
something
that
looks
like
money
i
do
know
who
you
are
nor
how
much
of
a
business
man
you
are
or
what
your
experience
is
but
i
risk
putting
in
twenty
thousand
dollars
pointed
out
newmark
i
putting
in
my
everlasting
reputation
said
orde
we
tell
these
fellows
that
we
get
out
their
logs
for
them
and
then
do
do
it
i
be
dead
around
that
about
a
said
newmark
betting
twenty
thousand
on
what
i
seen
and
heard
of
you
and
you
risking
your
reputation
that
i
do
want
to
drop
my
orde
laughed
i
reckon
we
both
right
he
responded
newmark
pursued
the
subject
no
objection
to
telling
you
about
myself
new
york
born
and
bred
experience
with
cooper
and
dunne
brokers
eight
years
money
from
a
legacy
parents
dead
no
relatives
to
speak
orde
nodded
gravely
twice
in
acknowledgment
said
newmark
you
had
time
to
do
any
figuring
replied
orde
got
at
it
a
little
yesterday
afternoon
and
a
little
this
noon
i
have
a
rough
he
produced
a
bundle
of
scribbled
papers
from
his
you
are
i
take
daly
as
a
sample
because
i
been
with
his
outfit
it
costs
him
to
run
and
deliver
his
logs
one
hundred
miles
about
two
dollars
a
thousand
feet
he
the
only
big
manufacturer
up
here
the
rest
are
all
at
monrovia
where
they
can
get
shipping
by
water
i
suppose
it
costs
the
other
nine
firms
doing
business
on
the
river
from
two
to
two
and
a
half
a
newmark
produced
a
and
began
to
jot
down
figures
these
men
all
conduct
separate
drives
he
inquired
but
proctor
and
old
heinzman
they
pool
in
went
on
newmark
we
were
to
drive
the
whole
river
how
could
we
improve
on
that
i
have
got
it
down
very
fine
of
course
orde
told
him
in
the
first
place
we
would
need
so
many
men
i
could
run
the
river
on
three
hundred
easy
enough
that
saves
wages
and
grub
on
two
hundred
right
there
and
of
course
a
few
improvements
on
the
river
would
save
time
which
in
our
case
would
mean
money
we
would
not
need
so
many
separate
cook
outfits
and
all
that
of
course
that
part
of
it
we
have
to
get
right
down
and
figure
on
and
it
will
take
time
then
too
if
we
agreed
to
sort
and
deliver
we
have
to
build
sorting
booms
down
at
we
had
all
that
what
for
example
do
you
reckon
you
could
bring
daly
logs
down
for
orde
fell
into
deep
thought
from
which
he
emerged
occasionally
to
scribble
on
the
back
of
his
memoranda
suppose
somewhere
about
a
dollar
he
announced
at
last
he
looked
up
a
trifle
startled
he
cried
looks
like
big
money
a
hundred
per
cent
newmark
watched
him
for
a
moment
a
quizzical
smile
wrinkling
the
corners
of
his
eyes
your
horses
said
he
at
last
do
know
anything
about
this
business
but
i
can
see
a
few
things
in
the
first
place
close
figuring
will
probably
add
a
few
cents
to
that
dollar
and
then
of
course
all
our
improvements
will
be
absolutely
valueless
to
anybody
after
got
through
using
them
you
said
yesterday
they
probably
stand
us
in
thousand
dollars
even
at
a
dollar
profit
we
have
to
drive
million
before
we
got
a
cent
back
and
of
course
we
got
to
agree
to
drive
for
a
little
less
than
they
could
so
agreed
orde
his
crest
falling
said
newmark
briskly
as
he
arose
good
money
in
it
as
you
say
now
how
soon
can
you
leave
daly
the
middle
of
the
week
we
ought
to
be
through
with
this
good
then
we
go
into
this
matter
of
expense
thoroughly
and
establish
our
schedule
of
rates
to
submit
to
the
different
newmark
said
a
punctilious
farewell
to
and
orde
the
way
said
orde
to
him
at
the
gate
are
you
staying
the
know
most
of
the
people
here
all
the
young
folks
i
be
glad
to
take
you
around
and
get
you
you
replied
newmark
are
very
kind
but
i
do
go
in
much
for
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
expect
to
be
very
busy
now
on
this
new
matter
so
i
wo
trouble
xi
the
new
partners
as
soon
as
orde
had
released
himself
from
daly
gave
all
their
time
to
working
out
a
schedule
of
tolls
orde
drew
on
his
intimate
knowledge
of
the
river
and
its
tributaries
and
the
locations
of
the
different
rollways
to
estimate
as
closely
as
possible
the
time
it
would
take
to
drive
them
he
also
hunted
up
tom
north
and
others
of
the
older
men
domiciled
in
the
cheap
of
talked
with
them
and
verified
his
own
impressions
together
he
and
newmark
visited
the
supply
houses
got
prices
obtained
lists
all
the
evenings
they
figured
busily
until
at
last
newmark
expressed
himself
as
satisfied
orde
said
he
is
where
you
come
in
it
now
your
job
to
go
out
and
interview
these
men
and
get
their
contracts
for
driving
their
next
winter
but
orde
drew
back
here
joe
he
objected
more
in
your
line
you
can
talk
business
to
them
better
than
i
a
bit
negatived
newmark
do
know
me
from
adam
and
they
do
know
you
and
all
about
you
we
got
to
carry
this
thing
through
at
first
on
our
face
and
they
be
more
apt
to
entrust
the
matter
to
you
right
agreed
orde
start
in
on
he
did
so
the
following
morning
daly
swung
his
bulk
around
in
his
revolving
and
listened
attentively
jack
said
he
think
you
a
good
riverman
and
i
believe
you
can
do
it
i
be
only
too
glad
to
get
rid
of
the
nuisance
of
it
let
alone
get
it
done
cheaper
if
you
draw
up
your
contract
and
bring
it
in
here
i
sign
it
i
suppose
you
break
out
the
rollways
said
orde
had
thought
of
doing
more
than
the
driving
and
distributing
you
have
to
deliver
the
logs
in
the
river
maybe
another
year
after
we
get
better
organised
we
be
able
to
break
rollways
at
a
price
per
thousand
but
until
we
get
we
have
to
rush
her
orde
repeated
this
to
his
associate
was
smooth
enough
sailing
he
exulted
pondered
newmark
removing
his
glasses
and
tapping
his
thumb
with
their
edge
he
repeated
was
smooth
sailing
what
was
that
about
rollways
i
told
him
we
expect
him
to
break
out
his
own
said
orde
but
what
does
that
mean
exactly
explained
orde
with
a
slight
stare
of
surprise
the
logs
are
cut
and
hauled
during
the
winter
they
are
banked
on
the
and
even
in
the
itself
then
when
the
thaws
come
in
the
spring
these
piles
are
broken
down
and
set
afloat
in
the
see
said
newmark
but
why
should
we
undertake
that
part
of
it
i
should
think
that
would
be
more
the
job
of
the
would
hold
back
our
drive
too
much
to
have
to
stop
and
break
rollways
explained
orde
the
next
morning
they
took
the
early
train
for
monrovia
where
were
situated
the
big
mills
and
the
offices
of
the
nine
other
lumber
companies
within
an
hour
they
had
descended
at
the
small
frame
terminal
station
and
were
walking
together
up
the
village
street
monrovia
was
at
that
time
a
very
little
place
of
perhaps
two
thousand
population
it
was
situated
a
half
mile
from
lake
michigan
behind
the
sparsely
wooded
sand
hills
of
its
shore
from
the
river
which
had
here
grown
to
a
great
depth
and
width
its
main
street
ran
directly
at
right
angles
four
brick
blocks
of
three
stories
lent
impressiveness
to
the
vista
the
stores
in
general
however
were
low
frame
structures
all
faced
broad
plank
sidewalks
raised
above
the
street
to
the
level
of
a
waggon
body
from
this
main
street
ran
off
to
right
and
left
other
streets
rendered
lovely
by
maple
trees
that
fairly
met
across
the
way
in
summer
over
sidewalk
and
roadway
alike
rested
a
dense
refreshing
dark
shadow
that
seemed
to
throw
from
itself
an
odour
of
coolness
this
was
rendered
further
attractive
by
the
warm
spicy
odour
of
damp
pine
that
arose
from
the
resilient
surface
of
sawdust
and
shingles
broken
beneath
the
wheels
of
traffic
back
from
these
trees
in
wide
lawns
stood
the
better
residences
they
were
almost
invariably
built
of
many
corners
with
steep
roofs
meeting
each
other
at
all
angles
with
wide
and
ornamented
red
chimneys
numerous
windows
and
much
scroll
work
adorning
each
apex
and
cornice
the
ridge
poles
bristled
in
fancy
palisades
of
wood
chimneys
were
provided
with
occasionally
an
older
structure
on
square
lines
recorded
the
era
of
a
more
dignified
architecture
everywhere
ran
broad
sidewalks
and
picket
fences
beyond
the
better
residence
districts
were
the
board
shanties
of
the
mill
workers
orde
and
newmark
tramped
up
the
plank
walk
to
the
farthest
brick
building
when
they
came
to
a
cross
street
they
had
to
descend
to
it
by
a
short
flight
of
steps
on
one
side
and
ascend
from
it
by
a
corresponding
flight
on
the
other
at
the
hotel
newmark
seated
himself
in
a
next
the
big
window
luck
said
he
orde
mounted
a
wide
dark
flight
of
stairs
that
led
from
the
street
to
a
darker
hall
the
smell
of
stale
cigars
and
cocoa
matting
was
in
the
air
down
the
dim
length
of
this
hall
he
made
his
way
to
a
door
which
without
ceremony
he
pushed
open
he
found
himself
in
a
space
separated
from
the
main
part
of
the
room
by
a
high
walnut
grill
heinzman
in
he
asked
of
a
clerk
think
so
replied
the
clerk
to
whom
evidently
orde
was
known
orde
spent
the
rest
of
the
morning
with
heinzman
a
very
rotund
cautious
person
of
german
extraction
and
accent
heinzman
occupied
the
time
in
asking
questions
of
all
sorts
about
the
new
enterprise
at
twelve
he
had
not
in
any
way
committed
himself
nor
expressed
an
opinion
he
however
instructed
orde
to
return
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
vill
see
proctor
said
he
orde
rather
exhausted
returned
to
find
newmark
still
sitting
in
the
with
his
unlighted
cigar
the
two
had
lunch
together
after
which
orde
somewhat
refreshed
started
out
he
succeeded
in
getting
two
more
promises
of
contracts
and
two
more
deferred
interviews
going
a
little
faster
he
told
newmark
cheerfully
the
following
morning
also
he
was
much
encouraged
by
the
reception
his
plan
gained
from
the
other
lumbermen
at
lunch
he
recapitulated
to
newmark
four
contracts
already
said
he
three
more
practically
a
sure
thing
proctor
and
heinzman
are
slower
than
molasses
about
everything
and
mean
as
pusley
and
johnson
up
in
the
air
the
way
he
always
is
for
fear
some
one
going
to
do
is
a
bad
outlook
admitted
newmark
but
heinzman
offered
a
new
problem
for
orde
consideration
haf
talked
with
proctor
said
he
ve
like
your
scheme
if
you
can
deliffer
our
logs
here
for
two
dollars
and
a
quarter
why
that
is
better
as
ve
can
do
it
but
how
do
ve
know
you
vill
do
it
guarantee
to
get
them
here
all
right
laughed
orde
what
is
your
guarantee
good
for
persisted
heinzman
blandly
locking
his
fingers
over
his
rotund
little
stomach
the
logs
are
not
deliffered
what
then
how
responsible
are
you
financially
we
investing
thousand
dollars
or
heinzman
rubbed
his
thumb
and
forefinger
together
and
wafted
the
imaginary
pulverisation
away
that
for
a
judgment
said
he
he
allowed
a
pause
to
ensue
you
vill
give
a
bond
for
the
performance
of
your
contract
pursued
heinzman
vould
be
orde
mind
was
struck
chaotic
by
the
reasonableness
of
this
request
and
the
utter
impossibility
of
acceding
to
it
much
of
a
bond
he
asked
thousand
vould
satisfy
us
said
heinzman
us
a
suitable
bond
for
that
amount
and
ve
vill
sign
your
orde
ran
down
the
stairs
to
find
newmark
wo
sign
unless
we
give
him
a
bond
for
performance
he
said
in
a
low
tone
as
he
dropped
into
the
chair
next
to
newmark
newmark
removed
his
unlighted
cigar
looked
at
the
chewed
end
and
returned
it
to
the
corner
of
his
mouth
has
sense
said
he
drily
was
wondering
if
ordinary
business
caution
was
unknown
out
we
get
such
a
bond
nobody
would
go
on
my
bond
for
that
either
said
newmark
just
have
to
let
them
go
and
drive
ahead
without
them
i
only
hope
they
wo
spread
the
idea
better
get
those
other
contracts
signed
up
as
soon
as
we
with
this
object
in
view
orde
started
out
early
the
next
morning
carrying
with
him
the
duplicate
contracts
on
which
newmark
had
been
busy
in
advised
newmark
saturday
and
we
do
want
to
let
things
simmer
over
sunday
if
we
can
help
about
eleven
a
clerk
of
the
welton
lumber
entered
welton
private
office
to
deliver
to
orde
a
note
just
came
by
special
messenger
he
explained
orde
with
an
apology
tore
it
open
it
was
from
heinzman
and
requested
an
immediate
interview
orde
delayed
only
long
enough
to
get
welton
signature
then
hastened
as
fast
as
his
horse
could
take
him
across
the
drawbridge
to
the
village
heinzman
he
found
awaiting
him
the
little
german
with
his
round
rosy
cheeks
his
dot
of
a
nose
his
big
spectacles
and
his
rotund
body
looked
even
more
than
usual
like
a
spider
or
a
santa
clause
orde
could
not
decide
which
haf
been
thinking
of
that
bond
he
began
waving
a
pudgy
hand
toward
a
seat
i
haf
been
talking
with
said
orde
hopefully
suppose
you
would
not
be
prepared
to
gif
a
bond
hardly
think
suppose
ve
fix
him
this
way
went
on
heinzman
clasping
his
hands
over
his
stomach
and
beaming
through
his
spectacles
and
i
haf
talked
it
ofer
and
ve
are
agreet
that
the
probosition
is
a
good
one
also
ve
think
it
is
vell
to
help
the
young
fellers
he
laughed
silently
in
such
a
manner
as
to
shake
himself
all
over
do
not
vish
to
be
too
severe
and
yet
ve
must
be
assured
that
ve
get
our
logs
on
time
now
i
unterstood
you
to
say
that
this
new
concern
is
a
stock
orde
did
not
remember
having
said
so
but
he
nodded
if
you
gif
us
a
bond
secured
with
stock
in
the
new
company
that
would
be
satisfactory
to
orde
face
cleared
you
mean
that
heinzman
ve
must
haf
some
security
but
ve
do
not
vish
to
be
too
hard
on
you
i
call
that
a
mighty
good
way
out
cried
orde
your
contract
out
according
to
these
terms
then
said
heinzman
handing
him
a
paper
bring
it
in
orde
glanced
over
the
slip
it
recited
two
and
a
quarter
as
the
agreed
price
specified
the
date
of
delivery
at
heinzman
and
proctor
booms
named
thousand
dollars
as
the
amount
of
the
bond
to
be
secured
by
fifty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
stock
in
the
new
company
this
looked
satisfactory
orde
arose
much
obliged
to
you
heinzman
said
he
bring
it
around
he
had
reached
the
gate
to
the
grill
before
heinzman
called
him
back
the
vay
the
little
german
beamed
up
at
him
swinging
his
fat
legs
as
the
tipped
back
on
its
springs
it
is
to
be
a
stock
company
you
vill
be
selling
some
of
the
stock
to
raise
money
is
it
not
so
agreed
orde
expect
much
vill
you
capitalise
for
expect
a
hundred
thousand
ought
to
do
the
trick
replied
orde
said
heinzman
you
put
it
on
the
market
come
and
see
he
nodded
paternally
at
orde
beaming
through
his
thick
spectacles
that
evening
well
after
six
orde
returned
to
the
hotel
after
freshening
up
in
the
marbled
and
boarded
washroom
he
hunted
up
newmark
joe
said
he
as
hungry
as
a
bear
come
on
eat
and
tell
you
all
about
they
deposited
their
hats
on
the
racks
and
pushed
open
the
swinging
screen
doors
that
led
into
the
there
they
were
taken
in
charge
by
a
marvellously
haughty
and
redundant
who
signalled
them
to
follow
down
through
ranks
of
small
tables
watched
by
more
stately
damsels
newmark
reserved
and
precise
irreproachably
correct
in
his
neat
gray
seemed
enveloped
in
an
aloofness
as
impenetrable
as
that
of
the
herself
orde
however
was
as
breezy
as
ever
he
hastened
his
stride
to
overtake
the
be
good
he
said
in
his
jolly
way
got
business
to
talk
put
us
somewhere
newmark
nodded
approval
and
thrust
his
hand
in
his
pocket
but
annie
looked
up
into
orde
frank
laughing
face
and
her
lips
curved
ever
so
faintly
in
the
condescension
of
a
smile
sorr
said
she
in
a
most
unexpected
brogue
i
got
all
said
orde
as
soon
as
the
waitress
had
gone
with
the
order
the
best
stroke
of
business
you
never
guess
i
roped
in
approved
newmark
briefly
was
really
pretty
decent
of
the
little
dutchman
he
agreed
to
let
us
put
up
our
stock
as
security
of
course
that
security
is
good
only
if
we
win
out
and
if
we
win
out
why
then
he
get
his
logs
so
he
have
any
use
for
security
so
it
just
one
way
of
beating
the
devil
around
the
bush
he
evidently
wanted
to
give
us
the
business
but
he
hated
like
the
devil
to
pass
up
his
rules
you
know
how
those
old
shellbacks
yes
said
newmark
the
waitress
sailed
in
through
a
violently
kicked
swinging
door
bearing
aloft
a
tin
tray
heaped
perilously
she
slanted
around
a
corner
in
graceful
opposition
to
the
centrifugal
brought
the
tray
to
port
on
a
sort
of
landing
stage
by
a
pillar
and
began
energetically
to
distribute
small
dishes
each
containing
a
dab
of
something
when
the
clash
of
arrival
had
died
orde
went
on
got
into
your
department
a
little
that
asked
newmark
spearing
a
baked
potato
said
he
buy
some
of
our
stock
he
seems
to
think
we
have
a
pretty
good
newmark
paused
his
potato
to
his
plate
of
him
said
he
after
a
moment
he
sign
a
contract
was
made
out
orde
reminded
him
the
memoranda
here
make
it
out
i
am
to
bring
it
in
see
we
hung
up
here
over
sunday
observed
newmark
sunday
trains
to
orde
became
grave
know
it
i
tried
to
hurry
matters
to
catch
the
six
but
could
make
his
round
jolly
face
fell
sombre
as
though
a
light
within
had
been
extinguished
after
a
moment
the
light
returned
be
helped
said
he
philosophically
they
ate
hungrily
then
drifted
out
into
the
office
again
where
orde
lit
a
cigar
let
see
your
memoranda
said
newmark
he
frowned
over
the
three
simple
items
for
some
time
got
me
he
confessed
at
last
inquired
orde
heinzman
is
up
do
you
mean
asked
orde
turning
in
his
chair
with
an
air
of
slow
surprise
all
looks
queer
to
me
he
got
something
up
his
sleeve
why
should
he
take
a
bond
with
that
security
from
us
if
we
ca
deliver
the
logs
our
company
fails
that
makes
the
stock
worthless
that
makes
the
bond
worthless
just
when
it
is
needed
of
course
it
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
face
that
he
thinks
the
proposition
a
good
one
and
is
trying
to
get
no
cried
orde
astounded
you
all
right
on
the
river
said
newmark
with
a
dry
little
laugh
you
a
babe
in
the
woods
at
this
heinzman
is
honest
cried
orde
he
is
a
church
member
and
has
a
class
in
newmark
selected
a
cigar
from
his
case
examined
it
from
end
to
end
finally
put
it
between
his
lips
the
corners
of
his
mouth
were
twitching
quietly
with
amusement
he
is
going
to
buy
some
stock
added
orde
after
a
moment
has
not
the
slightest
intention
of
buying
a
dollar
worth
of
stock
asserted
newmark
why
did
he
make
that
bluff
finished
newmark
he
wanted
to
find
out
how
much
stock
would
be
issued
you
told
him
it
would
be
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
did
you
yes
i
believe
i
did
said
orde
pondering
newmark
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
noiselessly
now
he
knows
that
if
we
forfeit
the
bond
he
have
controlling
interest
he
pointed
out
orde
smoked
rapidly
his
brow
troubled
what
i
ca
make
out
reflected
newmark
why
he
so
sure
we
have
to
think
he
just
taking
a
long
shot
at
it
suggested
orde
who
seemed
finally
to
have
decided
against
newmark
opinion
believe
shying
at
mare
he
he
has
some
good
reason
for
thinking
we
wo
deliver
the
logs
why
does
he
insist
on
putting
in
a
date
for
delivery
none
of
the
others
do
know
replied
orde
to
put
some
sort
of
a
time
limit
on
the
thing
i
say
you
surely
can
get
the
drive
through
by
then
orde
laughed
why
it
gives
me
two
weeks
leeway
over
the
worst
possible
luck
i
could
have
you
too
almighty
suspicious
newmark
shook
his
head
let
me
figure
this
out
said
he
but
bedtime
found
him
without
a
solution
he
retired
to
his
room
under
fire
of
orde
raillery
orde
himself
shut
his
door
the
smile
still
on
his
lips
as
he
began
removing
his
coat
however
the
smile
died
the
week
had
been
a
busy
one
hardly
had
he
exchanged
a
dozen
words
with
his
parents
for
he
had
even
been
forced
to
eat
his
dinner
and
supper
away
from
home
this
sunday
he
had
promised
himself
to
make
his
deferred
but
call
on
jane
hubbard
and
her
guest
he
turned
out
the
gas
with
a
shrug
of
resignation
for
the
first
time
his
brain
cleared
of
its
turmoil
of
calculations
of
guesses
of
estimates
and
of
men
he
saw
clearly
the
limited
illumination
cast
downward
by
the
lamp
beneath
its
wide
shade
the
graceful
white
figure
against
the
shadow
of
the
easy
chair
the
oval
face
cut
in
half
by
the
lamplight
to
show
plainly
the
red
lips
with
the
quaint
upward
quirks
at
the
corners
and
dimly
the
inscrutable
eyes
and
the
hair
with
the
soft
shadows
with
a
sigh
he
fell
asleep
some
time
in
the
night
he
was
awakened
by
a
persistent
tapping
on
the
door
in
the
woodsman
manner
he
was
instantly
broad
awake
he
lit
the
gas
and
opened
the
door
to
admit
newmark
partially
dressed
over
his
night
gown
said
he
briefly
and
without
preliminary
you
tell
me
the
other
day
that
rollways
were
piled
both
on
the
banks
and
in
the
river
sometimes
said
orde
they
might
obstruct
the
river
thought
so
cried
newmark
with
as
near
an
approach
to
exultation
as
he
ever
permitted
himself
just
one
other
thing
are
rollways
below
most
of
the
others
i
believe
they
are
said
orde
of
course
it
was
agreed
as
usual
that
heinzman
was
to
break
out
his
own
rollways
see
said
orde
slowly
think
he
intends
to
delay
things
enough
so
we
ca
deliver
on
the
date
agreed
know
it
stated
newmark
positively
if
he
refuses
to
deliver
the
logs
no
court
of
law
will
cried
newmark
to
deliver
you
do
know
that
kind
he
wo
refuse
to
deliver
there
just
be
a
lot
of
inevitable
delays
and
his
foreman
will
misunderstand
and
all
that
you
ought
to
know
more
about
that
than
i
orde
nodded
his
eye
abstracted
a
scheme
commented
newmark
i
had
more
knowledge
of
the
business
i
have
seen
it
never
have
seen
it
at
all
said
orde
humbly
seem
to
be
the
valuable
member
of
this
firm
my
way
said
newmark
in
yours
we
ought
to
make
a
good
xii
sunday
afternoon
orde
leaving
newmark
to
devices
of
his
own
walked
slowly
up
the
main
street
turned
to
the
right
down
one
of
the
shaded
side
residence
streets
that
ended
finally
in
a
beautiful
glistening
up
this
he
toiled
slowly
starting
at
every
step
avalanches
and
streams
down
the
slope
shortly
he
found
himself
on
the
summit
and
paused
for
a
breath
of
air
from
the
lake
he
was
just
above
the
tops
of
the
maples
which
seen
from
this
angle
stretched
away
like
a
forest
through
which
occasionally
thrust
roofs
and
spires
some
distance
beyond
a
number
of
taller
buildings
and
the
red
of
bricks
were
visible
beyond
them
still
were
other
planted
raggedly
with
and
stunted
trees
but
between
the
brick
buildings
and
these
flowed
the
river
wide
deep
and
still
bordered
by
the
steamboat
landings
on
the
town
side
and
by
fishermen
huts
and
and
small
boats
on
the
other
orde
seated
himself
on
the
smooth
clean
sand
and
removed
his
hat
he
saw
these
things
and
in
imagination
the
far
upper
stretches
of
the
river
with
the
mills
and
yards
and
booms
extending
for
miles
and
still
above
them
the
marshes
and
the
flats
where
the
river
widened
below
the
big
bend
that
would
be
the
location
for
the
booms
of
the
new
company
a
cheap
property
on
which
the
partners
had
already
secured
a
valuation
and
below
he
dropped
in
imagination
with
the
slackening
current
until
between
two
greater
than
the
rest
the
river
ran
out
through
the
channel
made
by
two
long
piers
to
the
lake
blue
restless
immeasurable
to
right
and
left
stretched
the
long
michigan
coast
with
its
low
yellow
hills
topped
with
the
green
of
twisted
pines
firs
and
beeches
with
always
its
beach
of
sand
deep
and
dry
to
the
very
edge
of
its
tideless
sea
strewn
with
sawlogs
bark
and
the
ancient
remains
of
ships
after
he
had
cooled
he
arose
and
made
his
way
back
to
a
pleasant
hardwood
forest
of
maple
and
beech
here
the
leaves
were
just
bursting
from
their
buds
underfoot
the
early
spring
flowers
the
hepaticas
the
anemones
the
trilium
the
violets
the
quaint
early
undergrowths
were
just
reaching
their
perfection
migration
was
in
full
tide
birds
little
and
big
flashed
into
view
and
out
again
busy
in
the
mystery
of
their
northward
pilgrimage
giving
the
appearance
of
secret
and
silent
furtiveness
yet
each
uttering
his
characteristic
call
from
time
to
time
as
though
for
a
signal
to
others
of
the
host
the
woods
were
swarming
as
city
streets
yet
to
orde
these
little
creatures
were
as
though
invisible
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
a
great
multitude
he
felt
himself
under
the
observation
of
many
bright
eyes
he
heard
the
murmuring
and
twittering
that
proclaimed
a
throng
he
sensed
an
onward
movement
that
flowed
slowly
but
steadily
toward
the
pole
nevertheless
a
flash
of
wings
a
fluttering
little
body
the
dip
of
a
hasty
short
flight
represented
the
visible
tokens
across
the
pale
silver
sun
of
april
their
shadows
flickered
and
with
them
flickered
the
tracery
of
new
leaves
and
the
delicacy
of
the
upper
branches
orde
walked
slowly
farther
and
farther
into
the
forest
lost
in
an
enjoyment
which
he
could
not
have
defined
accurately
but
which
was
so
integral
a
portion
of
his
nature
that
it
had
drawn
him
from
the
banks
and
wholesale
groceries
to
the
woods
after
a
while
he
sat
down
on
a
log
and
lit
his
pipe
ahead
the
ground
sloped
upward
dimly
through
the
of
the
early
season
he
could
make
out
the
yellow
of
sands
and
the
deep
complementary
blue
of
the
sky
above
them
he
knew
the
lake
to
lie
just
beyond
with
the
thought
he
arose
a
few
moments
later
he
stood
on
top
the
hill
gazing
out
over
the
blue
waters
very
blue
they
were
with
a
contrasting
snowy
white
fringe
of
waves
breaking
gently
as
far
up
the
coast
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
beach
on
these
tideless
waters
was
hard
and
smooth
only
in
the
narrow
strip
over
which
ran
the
wash
of
the
low
surf
all
the
rest
of
the
expanse
of
sand
back
to
the
hills
lay
dry
and
tumbled
into
hummocks
and
drifts
from
which
projected
here
a
sawlog
cast
inland
from
a
raft
by
some
storm
there
a
slab
again
a
ship
rib
sticking
gaunt
and
defiant
from
the
shifting
restless
medium
that
would
smother
it
and
just
beyond
the
edge
of
the
hard
sand
following
the
long
curves
of
the
wash
lay
a
dark
narrow
line
of
bark
fragments
the
air
was
very
clear
and
crystalline
the
on
the
ends
of
the
twin
piers
though
some
miles
distant
seemed
close
at
hand
white
herring
gulls
cruising
against
the
blue
flashed
white
as
the
sails
of
a
distant
ship
a
fresh
breeze
darkened
the
blue
velvet
surface
of
the
water
tumbled
the
white
foam
hissing
up
the
beach
blew
forward
over
the
dunes
a
fine
hurrying
mist
of
sand
and
bore
to
orde
at
last
the
refreshment
of
the
wide
spaces
a
woman
walking
slowly
bent
her
head
against
the
force
of
this
wind
orde
watched
her
idly
she
held
to
the
better
footing
of
the
smooth
sand
which
made
it
necessary
that
she
retreat
often
before
the
inrushing
wash
sometimes
rather
hastily
orde
caught
himself
admiring
the
grace
of
her
deft
and
sudden
movements
and
the
sway
of
her
willowy
figure
every
few
moments
she
turned
and
faced
the
lake
her
head
thrown
back
the
wind
whipping
her
garments
about
her
as
she
drew
nearer
orde
tried
in
vain
to
catch
sight
of
her
face
she
looked
down
watching
the
waters
advance
and
recede
she
wore
a
brimmed
hat
bent
around
her
head
by
means
of
some
sort
of
veil
tied
over
the
top
and
beneath
her
chin
when
she
had
arrived
nearly
opposite
orde
she
turned
abruptly
inland
and
a
moment
later
began
laboriously
to
climb
the
steep
sand
the
process
seemed
to
amuse
her
she
turned
her
head
sidewise
to
watch
with
interest
the
hurrying
tumbling
little
cascades
that
slid
from
her
every
step
from
time
to
time
she
would
raise
her
skirts
daintily
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
lean
far
over
in
order
to
observe
with
interest
how
her
feet
sank
to
the
ankles
and
how
the
sand
rushed
from
either
side
to
fill
in
the
depressions
the
wind
carried
up
to
orde
low
joyous
chuckles
of
delight
like
those
of
a
happy
child
as
though
directed
by
some
unseen
guide
her
course
veered
more
and
more
until
it
led
directly
to
the
spot
where
orde
stood
when
she
was
within
ten
feet
of
him
she
at
last
raised
her
head
so
the
young
man
could
see
something
besides
the
top
of
her
hat
orde
looked
plump
into
her
eyes
she
said
cheerfully
and
unsurprised
and
sank
down
at
his
feet
orde
stood
quite
motionless
overcome
by
astonishment
her
face
its
long
oval
framed
in
the
bands
of
the
gray
veil
and
the
brim
of
the
hat
looked
up
smiling
into
his
the
fresh
air
had
deepened
the
colour
beneath
her
skin
and
had
blown
loose
stray
locks
of
the
fine
hair
her
red
lips
with
the
quaintly
corners
smiled
at
him
with
a
new
frankness
and
the
black
eyes
the
eyes
so
black
as
to
resemble
spots
had
lost
their
reserve
and
brimmed
over
quite
frankly
with
the
joy
of
life
she
scooped
up
a
handful
of
the
dry
clean
sand
from
either
side
of
her
raised
it
aloft
and
let
it
trickle
slowly
between
her
fingers
the
wind
snatched
at
the
sand
and
sprayed
it
away
in
a
beautiful
plume
this
real
fun
she
asked
him
miss
bishop
cried
orde
finding
his
voice
are
you
doing
here
a
faint
shade
of
annoyance
crossed
her
brow
i
could
ask
the
same
of
you
and
then
we
talk
about
how
surprised
we
are
world
without
end
said
she
important
thing
is
that
here
is
sand
to
play
in
and
there
is
the
lake
and
here
are
we
and
the
day
is
charmed
and
it
good
to
be
alive
sit
down
and
dig
a
hole
all
the
common
days
to
explain
things
orde
laughed
and
seated
himself
to
face
her
without
further
talk
and
quite
gravely
they
commenced
to
scoop
out
an
excavation
between
them
piling
the
sand
over
themselves
and
on
either
side
as
was
most
convenient
as
the
hole
grew
deeper
they
had
to
lean
over
more
and
more
their
heads
sometimes
brushed
ever
so
lightly
their
hands
perforce
touched
always
the
dry
sand
flowed
from
the
edges
partially
to
fill
in
the
result
their
efforts
faster
and
faster
they
scooped
it
out
again
the
excavation
thus
took
on
the
shape
of
a
funnel
her
cheeks
glowed
pink
her
eyes
shone
like
stars
entirely
was
she
absorbed
in
the
task
at
last
a
tiny
commotion
manifested
itself
in
the
bottom
of
the
funnel
impulsively
she
laid
her
hand
on
orde
to
stop
them
fascinated
they
watched
after
incredible
though
lilliputian
upheavals
at
length
appeared
a
tiny
black
insect
struggling
against
the
rolling
overwhelming
sands
with
great
care
the
girl
scooped
this
newcomer
out
and
set
him
on
the
level
ground
she
looked
up
happily
at
orde
thrusting
the
loose
hair
from
in
front
of
her
eyes
was
convinced
we
ought
to
dig
a
hole
said
she
gravely
go
somewhere
she
arose
to
her
feet
shaking
the
sand
free
from
her
skirts
think
through
these
woods
she
decided
we
get
back
to
town
this
way
receiving
orde
assurance
she
turned
at
once
down
the
slope
through
the
fringe
of
scrub
spruces
and
junipers
into
the
tall
woods
here
the
air
fell
still
she
remarked
on
how
warm
it
seemed
and
began
to
untie
from
over
her
ears
the
narrow
band
of
veil
that
held
close
her
hat
replied
orde
say
that
the
woods
are
the
poor
man
she
paused
to
savour
this
her
head
on
one
side
her
arms
upraised
to
the
knot
i
like
that
said
she
continuing
her
task
in
a
moment
or
so
the
veil
hung
free
she
removed
it
and
the
hat
and
swung
them
both
from
one
finger
and
threw
back
her
head
all
the
birds
she
said
softly
she
began
to
utter
a
cheeping
noise
between
her
lips
and
teeth
low
and
plaintive
at
once
the
volume
of
about
increased
the
flashes
became
more
frequent
a
second
later
the
twigs
were
alive
with
tiny
warblers
and
creepers
flirting
from
branch
to
branch
with
larger
more
circumspect
chewinks
catbirds
and
finches
hopping
down
from
above
very
silent
very
grave
in
the
depths
of
the
thickets
the
shyer
hermit
and
olive
thrushes
and
the
oven
birds
revealed
themselves
or
as
lift
into
a
half
visibility
through
translucent
shadows
the
colour
of
themselves
all
were
very
intent
very
earnest
very
interested
each
after
his
own
manner
in
the
comradeship
of
the
featherhood
he
imagined
to
be
uttering
distressful
cries
a
few
like
the
chickadees
quivered
their
wings
opened
their
little
mouths
fluttered
down
tiny
but
aggressive
against
the
disaster
others
hopped
here
and
there
restlessly
uttering
plaintive
cheeps
the
shyest
contented
themselves
by
a
discreet
silent
and
distant
sympathy
three
or
four
freebooting
jays
attracted
not
so
much
by
the
supposed
calls
for
help
as
by
curiosity
fluttered
among
the
tops
of
the
trees
uttering
their
harsh
notes
finally
the
girl
ended
her
performance
in
a
musical
laugh
away
brighteyes
she
called
all
right
nobody
she
waved
her
hand
as
though
at
a
signal
the
host
she
had
evoked
melted
back
into
the
shadows
of
the
forest
only
the
chickadee
impudent
as
ever
retreated
scolding
rather
ostentatiously
and
the
jays
splendid
in
their
ornate
blue
screamed
opinions
at
each
other
from
the
tops
of
trees
would
you
like
to
be
a
bird
she
inquired
thought
replied
orde
you
ever
indulge
in
vain
and
idle
speculations
she
inquired
mind
do
answer
it
too
much
to
expect
of
a
she
set
herself
in
idle
motion
down
the
slope
swinging
the
hat
at
the
end
of
its
veil
pausing
to
look
or
listen
humming
a
little
melody
between
her
closed
lips
throwing
her
head
back
to
breathe
deep
the
warm
air
revelling
in
the
woods
sounds
and
woods
odours
and
woods
life
with
entire
orde
followed
her
in
silence
she
seemed
to
be
quite
without
responsibility
in
regard
to
him
and
yet
an
occasional
random
remark
thrown
in
his
direction
proved
that
he
was
not
forgotten
finally
they
emerged
from
the
beach
woods
they
faced
an
open
rolling
country
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
were
the
old
stumps
of
pine
trees
sometimes
they
stood
in
place
burned
and
scarred
but
attesting
mutely
the
abiding
place
of
a
spirit
long
since
passed
away
sometimes
they
had
been
uprooted
and
dragged
to
mark
the
boundaries
of
fields
where
they
raised
an
abatis
of
twisted
roots
to
the
sky
the
girl
stopped
short
as
she
came
face
to
face
with
this
open
country
the
inner
uplift
that
had
lent
to
her
aspect
the
careless
joy
of
a
child
faded
in
its
place
came
a
new
and
serious
gravity
she
turned
on
him
troubled
eyes
do
this
she
accused
him
quite
simply
for
answer
he
motioned
to
the
left
where
below
them
lay
a
wide
and
cultivated
countryside
farmhouses
surrounded
by
elms
compact
wood
lots
of
hardwood
crops
and
orchards
all
fair
and
pleasant
across
the
bosom
of
a
fertile
nature
this
said
he
valley
was
once
nothing
but
a
pine
forest
and
so
was
all
the
southern
part
of
the
state
the
peach
belt
and
the
farms
and
for
that
matter
indiana
too
and
all
the
other
forest
states
right
out
to
the
prairies
where
would
we
be
now
if
we
had
done
that
he
pointed
across
at
the
hills
mischief
had
driven
out
the
gravity
from
the
girl
eyes
she
had
lowered
her
head
slightly
sidewise
as
though
to
conceal
their
expression
from
him
was
beginning
to
be
afraid
you
say
said
she
orde
looked
bewildered
then
remembered
the
incubus
and
laughed
have
been
very
conversational
he
acknowledged
not
she
said
severely
would
have
been
very
disappointing
there
has
been
nothing
to
she
turned
and
waved
her
hat
at
the
beech
woods
falling
sombre
against
the
lowering
sun
she
said
gravely
pleasant
dreams
to
you
i
hope
those
very
saucy
little
birds
wo
keep
you
she
looked
up
at
orde
was
rather
nice
to
us
this
afternoon
she
explained
always
well
to
be
polite
to
them
she
gazed
steadily
at
orde
for
signs
of
amusement
he
resolutely
held
his
face
sympathetic
i
think
we
go
home
said
she
they
made
their
way
between
the
stumps
to
the
edge
of
the
overlooking
the
village
with
one
accord
they
stopped
the
sun
cast
across
the
vista
a
sleepy
light
of
evening
would
you
like
to
live
in
a
place
like
that
all
your
life
asked
orde
do
she
weighed
her
words
carefully
would
depend
the
place
is
of
so
much
importance
it
seems
to
me
it
the
life
one
is
called
to
it
whether
one
finds
her
soul
realm
or
not
that
a
place
is
liveable
or
not
i
can
imagine
entering
my
kingdom
at
a
railway
she
said
quaintly
missing
it
entirely
in
a
big
orde
looked
out
over
the
raw
little
village
with
a
new
interest
course
i
can
see
how
a
man
work
can
lie
in
a
small
place
said
he
a
woman
is
is
a
woman
different
she
challenged
is
her
as
you
call
it
and
why
should
it
as
well
as
a
man
lie
in
a
small
place
what
is
work
outside
of
drudgery
unless
it
is
correspondence
of
abilities
to
one
task
the
compensations
began
orde
vaguely
she
cried
do
you
mean
here
are
the
woods
and
fields
the
river
the
lake
the
birds
and
the
breezes
we
check
them
off
against
the
theatre
and
balls
books
can
be
had
here
as
well
as
anywhere
as
to
people
in
a
large
city
you
meet
a
great
many
and
they
all
busy
and
unless
you
make
an
especial
and
particular
effort
which
you
not
likely
to
you
see
them
only
casually
and
once
in
a
great
while
in
a
small
place
you
know
fewer
people
but
you
know
them
she
broke
off
with
a
from
new
york
she
stated
humorously
you
magicked
me
into
an
eloquent
defense
of
podunk
she
laughed
up
at
orde
quite
frankly
strides
she
challenged
suddenly
she
turned
off
the
edge
of
the
and
began
to
plunge
down
its
slope
leaning
far
back
her
arms
extended
increasing
as
much
as
possible
the
length
of
each
step
orde
followed
at
full
speed
when
the
bottom
was
reached
he
steadied
her
to
a
halt
she
shook
herself
straightened
her
hat
and
wound
the
veil
around
it
her
whole
aspect
seemed
to
have
changed
with
the
descent
into
the
conventionality
of
the
village
street
the
old
gentle
though
capable
and
reserve
had
returned
she
moved
beside
orde
with
dignity
came
down
with
jane
and
hubbard
to
see
hubbard
off
on
the
boat
for
milwaukee
last
night
she
told
him
course
we
had
to
wait
over
sunday
hubbard
and
jane
had
to
see
some
relative
or
other
but
i
preferred
to
take
a
are
you
staying
asked
orde
the
bennetts
do
you
know
where
it
is
replied
orde
they
said
little
more
until
the
bennetts
gate
was
reached
orde
declined
to
come
in
she
said
want
to
thank
you
you
did
not
once
act
as
though
you
thought
i
was
silly
or
crazy
and
you
did
try
as
all
the
rest
of
them
would
to
act
silly
too
you
could
have
done
it
and
you
did
try
oh
you
may
have
felt
it
i
know
she
smiled
one
of
her
quaint
and
quizzical
smiles
men
are
built
for
foolishness
they
have
to
leave
that
to
us
you
been
very
nice
this
afternoon
and
helped
a
lot
i
good
for
quite
a
long
stretch
now
she
nodded
to
him
and
left
him
by
the
gate
orde
however
walked
back
to
the
hotel
in
a
black
rage
with
himself
over
what
he
termed
his
imbecility
as
he
remembered
it
he
had
made
just
one
consecutive
speech
that
afternoon
said
he
to
newmark
at
the
hotel
office
the
plural
form
of
incubus
i
dimly
remember
it
is
answered
newmark
said
orde
gloomily
xiii
have
heinzman
contract
all
drawn
said
newmark
the
next
morning
i
think
i
go
around
with
you
to
the
at
the
appointed
time
they
found
the
little
german
awaiting
them
a
rotund
smile
of
false
illuminating
his
rosy
face
orde
introduced
his
partner
newmark
immediately
took
charge
of
the
interview
have
executed
here
the
contract
and
the
bonds
secured
by
and
my
shares
of
stock
in
the
new
company
he
explained
is
only
necessary
that
you
affix
your
signature
and
summon
the
required
heinzman
reached
his
hands
for
the
papers
beaming
over
his
glasses
at
the
two
young
men
as
he
read
however
his
smile
vanished
and
he
looked
up
sharply
is
this
he
inquired
a
new
crispness
in
his
voice
tolt
me
he
accused
orde
you
were
not
brepared
to
break
out
the
rollways
you
tolt
me
you
would
egspect
me
to
do
that
for
agreed
orde
why
do
you
put
in
this
demanded
heinzman
reading
from
the
paper
in
his
hand
case
said
rollways
belonging
to
said
parties
of
the
second
part
are
not
broken
out
by
the
time
the
drive
has
reached
them
and
in
case
on
demand
said
parties
of
the
second
part
do
refuse
or
do
not
exercise
due
diligence
in
breaking
out
said
rollways
the
said
parties
of
the
first
part
shall
themselves
break
out
said
rollways
and
the
said
parties
of
the
second
part
do
hereby
agree
to
reimburse
said
parties
of
the
first
part
at
the
rate
of
a
dollar
per
thousand
board
feet
is
merely
to
protect
ourselves
struck
in
newmark
exploded
heinzman
his
face
purpling
dollar
a
tousand
is
absurd
course
it
is
agreed
newmark
expect
it
to
be
but
also
we
expect
you
to
break
out
your
own
rollways
in
time
it
is
intended
as
a
penalty
in
case
you
vill
not
stand
for
such
foolishness
pounded
heinzman
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
well
said
newmark
crisply
reaching
for
the
contract
but
heinzman
clung
to
it
is
absurd
he
repeated
in
a
milder
tone
i
vill
strike
it
he
did
so
with
a
few
dashes
of
the
pen
have
no
intention
stated
newmark
with
decision
giving
you
the
chance
to
hang
up
our
heinzman
caught
his
breath
like
a
child
about
to
cry
out
that
is
what
you
think
he
shouted
at
them
the
sort
of
men
you
think
we
are
i
show
you
you
can
not
come
into
honest
offices
to
insoolt
them
by
such
insinuations
he
tore
the
contract
in
pieces
and
threw
it
in
the
waste
basket
oudt
of
here
he
cried
newmark
arose
as
dry
and
precise
as
ever
orde
was
going
red
and
white
by
turns
and
his
hands
twitched
i
understand
you
to
refuse
our
offer
asked
newmark
coolly
yes
you
and
your
whole
kapoodle
yelled
heinzman
he
hopped
down
and
followed
them
to
the
grill
door
repeating
over
and
over
that
he
had
been
insulted
the
clerks
stared
in
amazement
once
at
the
foot
of
the
dark
stairs
and
in
the
open
street
orde
looked
up
at
the
sky
with
a
deep
breath
of
relief
said
he
was
a
terror
we
gone
off
the
wrong
foot
that
newmark
looked
at
him
with
some
amusement
do
mean
to
say
that
fooled
you
he
marvelled
asked
orde
that
talk
about
insults
and
the
rest
of
the
rubbish
he
saw
we
had
spotted
his
little
scheme
and
he
had
to
retreat
somehow
it
was
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
think
so
doubted
orde
know
so
if
he
was
mad
at
all
it
was
only
at
being
found
said
orde
got
an
enemy
on
our
hands
in
any
case
concluded
newmark
one
we
have
to
look
out
for
i
do
know
how
he
do
it
but
try
to
make
trouble
on
the
river
perhaps
he
try
to
block
the
stream
by
not
breaking
his
of
the
first
things
we
do
will
be
to
boom
through
a
channel
where
man
rollways
will
be
said
orde
a
faint
gleam
of
approval
lit
newmark
eyes
guess
you
be
equal
to
the
occasion
said
he
drily
before
the
afternoon
train
there
remained
four
hours
the
partners
at
once
hunted
out
the
little
frame
building
near
the
river
in
which
johnson
conducted
his
business
johnson
received
them
with
an
evident
reserve
of
suspicion
see
no
use
in
it
said
he
passing
his
hand
over
his
hair
down
in
the
fashion
can
run
me
own
widout
help
from
any
seems
to
settle
that
said
newmark
to
orde
after
they
had
left
well
his
drive
is
small
and
he
behind
us
orde
pointed
out
said
newmark
thoughtfully
said
newmark
as
they
trudged
back
to
their
hotel
to
get
lunch
and
their
get
to
work
at
my
part
of
it
this
proposition
of
heinzman
has
given
me
an
idea
i
not
going
to
try
to
sell
this
stock
outside
but
to
the
men
who
own
timber
along
the
river
then
they
wo
be
objecting
to
the
tolls
for
if
the
company
makes
any
profits
part
will
go
to
idea
cried
orde

these
contracts
to
show

about

a
proper
office
and
equipments
and
get
hold
of
a
of
course

to
make
this
our
suppose
so
said
orde
a
little
blankly
after
an
instant
he
laughed
you
know
i
had
thought
of
that
we
have
to
live
here
we
went
on
newmark
calmly
buy
the
supplies
to
the
best
advantage
i
can
and
see
that
they
get
here
in
good
shape
i
have
our
preliminary
lists
and
as
fast
as

and
i
see

inquired

my
money

orde
laughed
and
stretched
his
arms
over
his
head
she
a
nice
big
job
is
she
he
cried
joyously
xiv
orde
in
spite
of
his
activities
managed
to
see
carroll
bishop
twice
during
the
ensuing
week
on
his
return
home
late
monday
afternoon
grandma
orde
informed
him
with
a
shrewd
twinkle
that
she
wanted
him
surely
at
home
the
following
evening
asked
in
three
or
four
of
the
young
people
for
a
candy
pull
said
she
mother
asked
orde
crowd
the
smiths
collinses
jane
hubbard
and
her
said
grandma
orde
which
probably
went
to
show
that
she
had
in
the
meantime
been
making
inquiries
and
was
satisfied
with
them
you
suppose
they
care
for
candy
pulling
hazarded
orde
a
little
doubtfully
mean
will
she
countered
grandma
i
hope
for
both
your
sakes
she
is
not
beyond
a
little
so
it
proved
the
young
people
straggled
in
at
an
early
hour
after
supper
every
one
had
supper
in
those
days
carroll
bishop
and
jane
arrived
nearly
the
last
orde
stepped
into
the
hall
to
help
them
with
their
wraps
he
was
surprised
as
he
approached
miss
bishop
to
lift
her
cloak
from
her
shoulders
to
find
that
the
top
of
her
daintily
poised
head
with
its
soft
fine
hair
came
well
below
the
level
of
his
eyes
somehow
her
poise
her
slender
grace
of
movement
and
of
attitude
had
lent
her
the
impression
of
a
stature
she
did
not
possess
her
eyes
while
fathomless
as
ever
shone
quietly
in
anticipation
you
know
she
told
orde
delightedly
have
never
been
to
a
real
candy
pull
in
my
life
it
was
so
good
of
your
mother
to
ask
me
what
a
dear
she
looks
and
is
that
your
father
i
going
to
speak
to
she
turned
through
the
narrow
door
into
the
lighted
parlour
where
the
company
were
chatting
busily
orde
mechanically
followed
her
he
was
arrested
by
the
sound
of
jane
hubbard
slow
voice
behind
him
jack
she
drawled
agree
with
you
perfectly
but
that
is
no
reason
why
i
should
be
neglected
entirely
come
and
hang
up
my
full
of
remorse
orde
turned
jane
hubbard
stood
accusingly
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
her
plain
shrewd
face
smiling
faintly
orde
met
her
frank
wide
eyes
with
some
embarrassment
it
is
said
jane
holding
out
the
coat
do
much
care
whether
you
hang
it
up
or
not
i
just
wanted
to
call
you
back
to
wish
you
her
slow
smile
widened
and
her
gray
eyes
met
his
still
more
knowingly
orde
seized
the
coat
and
her
hand
at
the
same
time
you
a
trump
said
he
wonder
you
the
most
popular
girl
in
course
i
am
jack
she
agreed
indolently
she
entered
the
parlour
the
candy
pulling
was
a
success
of
course
everybody
got
burned
a
little
and
spattered
a
good
deal
but
that
was
to
be
expected
after
the
product
had
been
broken
and
been
piled
on
dishes
all
trooped
to
the
informal
where
an
open
fire
invited
to
stories
and
games
of
the
quieter
sort
some
of
the
girls
sat
in
chairs
though
most
joined
the
men
on
the
hearth
carroll
bishop
however
seemed
possessed
of
a
spirit
of
restlessness
the
place
seemed
to
interest
her
she
wandered
here
and
there
in
the
room
looking
now
at
the
photograph
of
uncle
jim
orde
now
at
the
great
pink
conch
shells
either
side
the
door
now
at
the
table
with
its
square
of
polished
agate
and
its
glass
beneath
which
stood
a
very
robin
this
contained
little
in
the
way
of
ornament
it
was
filled
on
the
contrary
with
old
comfortable
chairs
and
worn
books
the
girl
peered
at
the
titles
of
these
but
the
had
been
turned
low
in
favour
of
the
firelight
and
she
had
to
give
over
the
effort
to
identify
the
volumes
once
she
wandered
close
to
grandma
cushioned
wooden
rocker
and
passed
her
hand
lightly
over
the
old
shoulder
you
mind
if
i
look
at
things
she
asked
so
dear
and
sweet
and
old
and
different
from
our
new
york
all
you
want
to
dearie
said
grandma
orde
after
a
moment
she
passed
into
the
here
orde
found
her
her
hands
linked
in
front
of
her
it
is
so
quaint
and
delightful
she
exhaled
slowly
dear
dear
old
house
with
its
low
ceilings
and
its
queer
haphazard
lines
and
its
deep
windows
and
its
old
pictures
and
queer
unexpected
things
that
take
your
breath
is
one
of
the
oldest
houses
in
town
said
orde
i
suppose
it
is
picturesque
but
you
see
i
was
brought
up
here
so
i
used
to
until
you
leave
it
said
she
prophetically
live
away
from
it
then
all
these
things
will
come
back
to
you
to
make
your
heart
ache
for
they
rambled
about
together
orde
enthusiasm
gradually
kindling
at
the
flame
of
her
own
he
showed
her
the
marvellous
and
painstaking
pencil
sketch
of
napoleon
looking
out
over
a
sunset
done
by
aunt
martha
at
the
age
of
ten
it
hung
framed
in
the
upper
hall
has
always
been
there
ever
since
i
can
remember
said
orde
it
has
seemed
to
belong
there
i
never
thought
of
it
as
good
or
bad
just
as
know
she
nodded
in
this
spirit
also
they
viewed
the
plaster
statue
of
washington
in
the
lower
hall
and
the
roger
group
in
the
parlour
the
glass
cabinet
of
interested
her
greatly
the
carved
ivory
chessmen
the
dried
the
stone
from
sugar
loaf
rock
the
bit
from
the
wreck
of
the
north
star
the
gold
and
silver
shells
the
glittering
geodes
and
pyrites
the
fan
and
all
the
hundred
and
one
it
was
then
the
custom
to
collect
under
glass
they
even
ventured
part
way
up
the
creaky
attic
stairs
but
it
was
too
dark
to
enter
that
mysterious
region
hear
the
drip
of
water
she
whispered
her
finger
on
her
lips
the
tank
said
orde
has
it
a
dark
place
behind
it
she
begged
just
what
it
has
said
he
tell
me
are
there
real
hair
trunks
with
brass
knobs
on
mother
has
two
or
she
breathed
softly
tell
me
what
in
them
i
want
to
believe
in
brocades
and
sashes
do
you
know
she
looked
at
him
soberly
never
had
any
dark
places
behind
the
tank
nor
mysterious
trunks
when
i
was
a
might
begin
now
suggested
orde
you
mean
to
insinuate
i
have
grown
up
she
mocked
you
look
out
she
cried
suddenly
boojum
will
catch
us
and
picking
up
her
skirts
she
fairly
flew
down
the
narrow
stairs
orde
could
hear
the
light
swish
of
her
draperies
down
the
hall
and
then
the
pat
of
her
feet
on
the
stair
carpet
of
the
lower
flight
he
followed
rather
dreamily
a
glance
into
the
showed
the
group
gathered
close
around
the
fire
listening
to
lem
collin
attempt
at
a
ghost
story
she
was
not
there
he
found
her
then
in
the
parlour
she
was
kneeling
on
the
floor
before
the
glass
cabinet
of
curiosities
and
she
had
quite
flattened
her
little
nose
against
the
pane
at
his
exclamation
she
looked
up
with
a
laugh
is
the
proper
altitude
from
which
to
view
a
cabinet
of
curiosities
said
she
something
tells
me
you
ought
to
flatten
your
nose
she
held
out
both
hands
to
be
helped
up
what
a
house
for
a
child
she
cried
after
the
company
had
gone
orde
stood
long
by
the
front
gate
looking
up
into
the
infinite
spaces
somehow
and
vaguely
he
felt
the
night
to
be
akin
to
her
elusive
spirit
farther
and
farther
his
soul
penetrated
into
its
depths
and
yet
other
depths
lay
beyond
other
mysteries
other
unguessed
realms
and
yet
its
beauty
was
the
simplicity
of
space
and
dark
and
the
stars
the
next
time
he
saw
her
was
at
her
own
house
or
rather
the
house
of
the
friend
she
visited
orde
went
to
call
on
friday
evening
and
was
lucky
enough
to
find
the
girls
home
and
alone
after
a
decent
interval
jane
made
an
excuse
and
went
out
they
talked
on
a
great
variety
of
subjects
and
with
a
considerable
approach
toward
intimacy
not
until
nearly
time
to
go
did
orde
stumble
upon
the
vital
point
of
the
evening
he
had
said
something
about
a
plan
for
the
week
following
you
forget
that
by
that
time
i
shall
be
gone
said
she
he
echoed
blankly
said
she
you
remember
i
am
to
go
sunday
morning
thought
you
were
going
to
stay
a
was
but
i
certain
things
came
up
that
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
leave
i
sorry
you
going
stammered
orde
am
i
said
she
had
a
very
nice
time
i
wo
see
you
again
said
orde
still
groping
for
realisation
must
go
to
monrovia
but
i
be
down
to
see
you
come
said
she
not
to
be
for
good
he
expostulated
be
coming
she
threw
her
hands
palm
out
with
a
pretty
gesture
of
ignorance
is
in
the
lap
of
the
gods
said
she
you
write
me
occasionally
he
begged
to
that
she
began
a
very
poor
wo
you
write
he
insisted
do
not
make
it
a
custom
to
write
to
young
he
cried
believing
himself
enlightened
you
answer
if
i
write
you
what
whether
there
is
a
reply
to
may
i
write
you
suppose
i
could
very
well
prevent
you
if
you
were
sure
to
put
on
a
you
want
me
to
persisted
orde
she
began
gently
to
laugh
quite
to
herself
as
though
enjoying
a
joke
entirely
within
her
own
personal
privilege
are
so
direct
and
persistent
and
said
she
presently
if
you
be
very
good
and
not
whisper
to
the
other
little
pupils
i
tell
you
how
they
do
such
things
she
sat
up
straight
from
the
depths
of
her
chair
her
white
delicately
tapering
forearms
resting
lightly
on
her
knees
men
desiring
to
communicate
with
young
ladies
do
not
ask
them
bluntly
they
make
some
excuse
like
sending
a
book
a
magazine
a
marked
newspaper
or
even
a
bit
of
desired
information
at
the
same
time
they
send
notes
informing
the
girl
of
the
fact
the
girl
is
naturally
expected
to
acknowledge
the
politeness
if
she
wishes
the
correspondence
to
continue
she
asks
a
question
or
in
some
other
way
leaves
an
opening
do
you
see
i
see
said
orde
slightly
crestfallen
that
a
long
time
to
wait
i
like
to
feel
settled
about
a
thing
i
wanted
to
she
dropped
back
against
the
cushioned
slant
of
her
easy
chair
and
laughed
again
so
you
just
up
and
asked
she
teased
beg
your
pardon
if
i
was
rude
he
said
humbly
the
laughter
died
slowly
from
her
eyes
she
said
would
be
asking
pardon
for
being
yourself
you
wanted
to
know
so
you
asked
and
i
going
to
answer
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
correspond
with
you
and
tell
you
about
my
sort
of
things
if
you
happen
to
be
interested
in
them
i
warn
you
they
are
not
very
are
yours
said
he
she
half
rose
to
bow
in
mock
graciousness
caught
herself
and
sank
back
i
wo
she
said
more
than
half
to
herself
she
sat
brooding
for
a
moment
then
suddenly
her
mood
changed
she
sprang
up
shook
her
skirts
free
and
seated
herself
at
the
piano
to
orde
who
had
also
arisen
she
made
a
quaint
grimace
over
her
shoulder
your
handiwork
she
told
him
are
rapidly
bringing
me
to
the
truth
and
shame
the
devil
oh
he
must
be
dying
of
mortification
this
evening
she
struck
a
great
crashing
chord
holding
the
keys
while
the
strings
reverberated
and
echoed
down
slowly
into
silence
again
is
fair
she
went
on
you
big
simple
men
to
disarm
us
i
do
care
i
have
my
private
opinion
of
such
brute
strength
je
me
moque
she
wrinkled
her
nose
and
narrowed
her
eyes
then
ruthlessly
she
drowned
his
reply
in
a
torrent
of
music
like
mad
she
played
rocking
her
slender
body
back
and
forth
along
the
holding
rigid
her
fingers
her
hands
and
the
muscles
of
her
arms
the
bass
notes
roared
like
the
rumbling
of
thunder
the
treble
flashed
like
the
dart
of
lightnings
abruptly
she
muted
the
instrument
silence
fell
as
something
that
had
been
pent
and
suddenly
released
she
arose
from
the
piano
stool
quite
naturally
both
hands
at
her
hair
and
hubbard
dear
old
people
said
she
is
your
address
in
new
york
demanded
orde
she
sank
into
a
chair
nearby
with
a
pretty
uplifted
gesture
of
despair
surrender
she
cried
and
then
she
laughed
until
the
tears
started
from
her
eyes
and
she
had
to
brush
them
away
with
what
seemed
to
orde
an
absurd
affair
to
call
a
handkerchief
you
are
delicious
she
said
at
last
listen
i
live
at
west
ninth
street
can
you
remember
that
orde
nodded
now
any
other
questions
the
prisoner
can
reply
to
without
incriminating
herself
she
is
willing
to
she
folded
her
hands
demurely
in
her
lap
two
days
later
orde
saw
the
train
carry
her
away
he
watched
the
rear
car
disappear
between
the
downward
slopes
of
two
hills
and
then
finally
the
last
smoke
from
the
locomotive
dissipate
in
the
clear
blue
declining
jane
kindly
meant
offer
of
a
lift
he
walked
back
to
town
xv
the
new
firm
plunged
busily
into
its
more
pressing
activities
orde
especially
had
an
infinitude
of
details
on
his
hands
the
fat
in
his
side
pocket
filled
rapidly
with
rough
sketches
lists
and
estimates
constantly
he
interviewed
men
of
all
kinds
rivermen
mill
men
contractors
boat
builders
hardware
dealers
captains
builders
wholesale
grocery
men
cooks
chore
boys
all
a
little
world
in
itself
the
signs
of
progress
soon
manifested
themselves
below
big
bend
the
were
at
work
the
square
masses
of
their
hammers
rising
rapidly
to
the
tops
of
the
derricks
there
to
pause
a
moment
before
dropping
swiftly
to
a
dull
thump
they
were
placing
a
long
compact
row
which
should
be
the
outer
bulwarks
separating
the
from
the
channel
of
the
river
ashore
the
carpenters
were
knocking
together
a
long
low
structure
for
the
and
a
larger
building
destined
to
serve
as
for
the
regular
there
would
also
be
a
blacksmith
forge
a
storehouse
a
tool
and
a
barn
and
small
separate
shanties
for
the
married
men
below
more
labourers
with
picks
shovels
axes
and
scrapers
were
cutting
out
and
levelling
a
road
which
would
when
finished
meet
the
county
road
to
town
the
numerous
bayous
of
great
marsh
were
crossed
by
lying
flat
on
the
surface
of
the
water
which
spurted
up
in
rhythmical
little
jets
under
the
impact
of
hoofs
down
stream
eight
miles
below
the
mills
and
just
beyond
where
the
drawbridge
crossed
over
to
monrovia
duncan
shipyards
clipped
and
sawed
and
steamed
and
bent
and
bolted
away
at
two
tugboats
the
machinery
for
which
was
already
being
stowed
in
the
hold
of
a
vessel
lying
at
wharf
in
chicago
in
the
storerooms
of
hardware
firms
porters
carried
and
clerks
checked
off
chains
strap
iron
bolts
spikes
staples
band
iron
bar
iron
peavies
blocks
ropes
and
cables
these
things
took
time
and
attention
to
details
also
a
careful
supervision
the
spring
increased
burst
into
leaf
and
bloom
and
settled
into
summer
orde
was
constantly
on
the
move
as
soon
as
low
water
came
with
midsummer
however
he
arranged
matters
to
run
themselves
as
far
as
possible
left
with
newmark
minute
instructions
as
to
personal
supervision
and
himself
departed
to
redding
here
he
joined
a
crew
which
tom
north
had
already
collected
and
betook
himself
to
the
head
of
the
river
he
knew
exactly
what
he
intended
to
do
far
back
on
the
he
built
a
dam
the
construction
of
it
was
crude
consisting
merely
of
log
cribs
filled
with
stone
and
debris
placed
at
intervals
across
the
bed
of
the
stream
against
which
slanted
logs
made
a
face
the
gate
operated
simply
and
could
be
raised
to
let
loose
an
entire
flood
and
indeed
this
was
the
whole
purpose
of
the
dam
it
created
a
reservoir
from
which
could
be
freed
new
supplies
of
water
to
eke
out
the
dropping
spring
freshets
having
accomplished
this
formidable
labour
for
the
trees
had
to
be
cut
and
hauled
the
stone
carted
and
the
earth
shovelled
the
crew
next
moved
down
a
good
ten
miles
to
where
the
river
dropped
over
a
rapids
rough
and
full
of
boulders
here
were
built
and
placed
a
row
of
log
cribs
in
a
double
row
down
stream
to
define
the
channel
and
to
hold
the
drive
in
it
and
away
from
the
shallows
near
either
bank
the
profile
of
these
cribs
was
that
of
a
triangle
the
slanting
side
up
stream
booms
chained
between
them
helped
deflect
the
drive
from
the
shoals
their
more
important
office
however
was
to
give
footing
to
the
drivers
for
miles
then
nothing
of
importance
was
undertaken
two
or
three
particularly
bad
boulders
were
split
out
by
the
explosion
of
powder
charges
a
number
of
snags
and
old
trees
were
cut
away
and
disposed
of
the
channel
was
carefully
examined
for
obstructions
of
any
kind
whatever
then
the
party
came
to
the
falls
here
orde
purposed
his
most
elaborate
bit
of
rough
engineering
the
falls
were
only
about
fifteen
feet
high
but
they
fell
straight
down
to
a
bed
of
sheer
rock
this
had
been
eaten
by
the
eddies
into
and
crannies
until
a
jagged
irregular
had
formed
immediately
underneath
the
fall
naturally
this
implied
a
ledge
below
in
flood
time
the
water
boiled
and
roared
through
this
obstruction
in
a
torrent
the
saw
logs
caught
in
the
rush
plunged
end
on
into
the
hit
with
a
crash
and
were
spewed
out
below
more
or
less
battered
barked
and
stripped
sometimes
however
when
the
chance
of
the
drive
brought
down
a
hundred
logs
together
they
failed
to
shoot
over
the
barrier
of
the
ledge
then
followed
a
jam
a
bad
jam
difficult
and
dangerous
to
break
the
falls
had
taken
her
usurious
share
of
the
lives
the
river
annually
demands
as
her
toll
this
condition
of
affairs
orde
had
determined
if
possible
to
obviate
from
the
or
forty
miles
of
river
that
lay
above
and
from
its
tributaries
would
come
the
bulk
of
the
white
and
norway
pine
for
years
to
follow
at
least
two
thirds
of
each
drive
orde
figured
would
come
from
above
the
fall
said
he
to
north
could
carry
an
apron
on
a
slant
from
just
under
the
crest
and
over
the
it
would
shoot
both
the
water
and
the
logs
off
a
better
agreed
north
you
have
fun
placing
your
apron
with
all
that
water
running
through
why
it
would
drown
us
got
a
notion
on
that
said
orde
thing
is
to
get
the
material
a
hardwood
forest
topped
the
slope
into
this
went
the
the
straightest
trees
they
felled
trimmed
and
dragged
down
travoy
trails
they
constructed
on
sleds
they
built
for
the
purpose
to
the
banks
of
the
river
here
they
bored
the
two
holes
through
either
end
to
receive
the
bolts
when
later
they
should
be
locked
together
side
by
side
in
their
places
as
fast
as
they
were
prepared
men
with
rolled
them
down
the
slope
to
a
flat
below
the
falls
they
did
these
things
swiftly
and
well
because
they
were
part
of
the
practised
day
work
but
they
shook
their
heads
at
the
falls
after
the
trees
had
been
cut
in
sufficient
number
there
were
of
them
each
feet
long
orde
led
the
way
back
up
stream
a
half
mile
to
a
shallows
where
he
commanded
the
construction
of
a
number
of
exaggerated
sawhorses
with

the
had
evidently
been
making
many
trips
to
sand
creek
fifteen
miles
away
as
was
attested
by
a
large
pile
of
heavy
planks
when
the
sawhorses
were
completed
orde
directed
the
picks
and
shovels
to
be
brought
up
at
this
point
the
river
as
has
been
hinted
widened
over
shoals
the
banks
at
either
hand
too
were
flat
and
comparatively
low
as
is
often
the
case
in
bends
of
rivers
subject
to
annual
floods
the
banks
sloped
back
for
some
distance
into
a
lower
swamp
territory
orde
set
his
men
to
digging
a
channel
through
this
bank
it
was
no
slight
job
from
one
point
of
view
as
the
slope
down
into
the
swamp
began
only
at
a
point
forty
or
fifty
feet
inland
but
on
the
other
hand
the
earth
was
soft
and
free
from
rocks
when
completed
the
channel
gave
passage
to
a
rather
feeble
streamlet
from
the
outer
fringe
of
the
river
the
men
were
puzzled
but
orde
by
the
strange
freak
of
his
otherwise
frank
and
open
nature
as
usual
told
nothing
of
his
plans
even
to
tom

to
turn

was
once
more

the
crew

to
dig
a
long
ways
below
that
level
to
catch
the
main
current
and
then
him
alone
advised
north

at
his
short
pipe
wiser
than
a
tree
full
of
next
orde
assigned
two
men
to
each
of
the
sawhorses
and
instructed
them
to
place
the
horses
in
a
row
across
the
shallowest
part
of
the
river
and
broadside
to
the
stream
this
was
done
the
men
to
their
knees
in
the
swift
water
bore
down
heavily
to
keep
their
charges
in
place
other
men
immediately
began
to
lay
the
heavy
planks
side
by
side
perpendicular
to
and
on
the
side
of
the
horses
the
weight
of
the
water
clamped
them
in
place
big
rocks
and
gravel
shovelled
on
in
quantity
prevented
the
lower
ends
from
rising
the
wide
slant
of
the
legs
directed
the
pressure
so
far
downward
that
the
horses
were
prevented
from
floating
away
and
slowly
the
bulk
of
the
water
thus
raised
a
good
three
feet
above
its
former
level
turned
aside
into
the
new
channel
and
poured
out
to
inundate
the
swamp
beyond
a
good
volume
still
poured
over
the
top
of
the
temporary
dam
and
down
to
the
fall
but
it
was
by
this
expedient
so
far
reduced
that
work
became
possible
boys
cried
orde
while
we
got
the
chance
by
means
of
blocks
and
tackles
and
the
team
horses
the
logs
were
placed
side
by
side
slanting
from
a
point
two
feet
below
the
rim
of
the
fall
to
the
ledge
below
they
were
bolted
together
top
and
bottom
through
the
four
holes
bored
for
that
purpose
this
was
a
confusing
and
wet
business
sufficient
water
still
flowed
in
the
natural
channel
of
the
river
to
dash
in
spray
over
the
entire
work
men
toiled
wet
to
the
skin
their
garments
clinging
to
them
their
eyes
full
of
water
barely
able
to
breathe
yet
groping
doggedly
at
it
and
arriving
at
last
the
weather
was
warm
with
the
midsummer
they
made
a
joke
of
the
difficulty
and
found
inexhaustible
humour
in
the
fact
that
one
of
their
number
was
an
immersion
baptist
when
the
task
was
finished
they
pried
the
from
the
improvised
dam

them
neatly

the
sawhorses
and
piled

possible
future
use

the
temporary
channel
with
a
tree
or
so
and
earth
the
river
restored
to
its
immemorial
channel
by
these
men
who
had
so
nonchalantly
turned
it
aside
roared
on
singing
again
the
song
it
had
until
now
sung
uninterruptedly
for
centuries
orde
and
his
crew
tramped
back
to
the
falls
and
gazed
on
their
handiwork
with
satisfaction
instead
of
plunging
over
an
edge
into
a
turmoil
of
foam
and
eddies
now
the
water
flowed
smoothly
almost
without
a
break
over
an
incline
of
thirty
degrees
slip
over
that
slick
as
a
gun
barrel
said
tom

long
do
you
think
she
last
an
idea
replied
orde
may
have
to
do
it
again
next
summer
but
i
do
think
it
there
nothing
but
the
smooth
of
the
water
to
wear
those
logs
until
they
begin
to
quite
cheerfully
they
took
up
their
long
painstaking
journey
back
down
the
river
travel
down
the
river
was
at
times
very
pleasant
and
at
times
very
disagreeable
the
ground
had
now
hardened
so
that
a
wanigan
boat
was
unnecessary
instead
the
camp
outfit
was
transported
in
waggons
which
often
had
to
journey
far
inland
to
make
extraordinary
detours
but
which
always
arrived
somehow
at
the
various
camping
places
orde
and
his
men
of
course
took
the
river
trail
the
river
trail
ran
almost
unbroken
for
over
a
hundred
miles
of
meandering
way
it
climbed
up
the
high
banks
at
the
points
it
crossed
the
bluffs
along
their
sheer
edges
it
descended
to
the
thickets
in
the
flats
it
crossed
the
swamps
on
it
skirted
the
great
solemn
woods
sometimes
in
the
lower
reaches
its
continuity
was
broken
by
a
town
but
always
after
it
recovered
from
its
confusion
it
led
on
with
purpose
unvarying
never
did
it
desert
for
long
the
river
the
cool
green
still
reaches
or
the
tumbling
of
the
were
always
within
its
sight
sometimes
beneath
its
very
tread
when
occasionally
it
cut
in
across
a
very
long
bend
it
always
sent
from
itself
a
little
tributary
trail
which
traced
all
the
curves
and
returned
at
last
to
its
parent
undoubtedly
with
a
full
report
of
its
task
and
the
trail
was
beaten
hard
by
the
feet
of
countless
men
who
like
orde
and
his
crew
had
taken
grave
interested
charge
of
the
river
from
her
birth
to
her
final
rest
in
the
great
expanses
of
the
lake
it
is
there
although
the
life
that
brought
it
into
being
has
been
gone
from
it
these
many
years
in
midsummer
orde
found
the
river
trail
most
unfamiliar
in
appearance
hardly
did
he
recognise
it
in
some
places
it
possessed
a
wide
leisurely
expansiveness
an
indolent
luxury
a
lazy
invitation
born
of
broad
green
leaves
deep
and
mysterious
shadows
the
growth
of
ferns
docks
and
the
like
cool
in
the
shade
of
the
forest
the
shimmer
of
aspens
and
poplars
through
the
heat
the
green
of
tangling
vines
the
drone
of
insects
the
call
of
birds
the
opulent
splashing
of
through
the
woods
quite
lacking
to
the
hard
tight
season
in
which
his
river
work
was
usually
performed
what
in
the
early
year
had
been
merely
a
whip
of
brush
now
had
become
a
screen
through
whose
waving
shifting
interstices
he
caught
glimpses
of
the
river
flowing
green
and
cool
what
had
been
bare
timber
amongst
whose
twigs
and
branches
the
full
daylight
had
shone
unobstructed
now
had
clothed
itself
in
foliage
and
leaned
over
to
make
black
and
mysterious
the
water
that
flowed
beneath
countless
insects
hovered
over
the
polished
surface
of
that
water
cruised
about
little
birds
swooped
silently
down
and
fluttered
back

on
their
tiny
prey

hither
and
thither
in
apparently
purposeless
diagonals
once
in
a
great
while
the
black
depths
were
stirred
a
bass
rolled
lazily
over
carrying
with
him
his
captured
insect
leaving
on
the
surface
of
the
water
concentric
rings
which
widened
and
died
away
the
trail
led
the
crew
through
many
minor
labours
all
of
which
consumed
time
at
reed
mill
orde
entered
into
diplomatic
negotiations
with
old
man
reed
whom
he
found
singularly
amenable
the
skirmish
in
the
spring
seemed
to
have
taken
all
the
fight
out
of
him
or
perhaps
more
simply
orde
attitude
toward
him
at
that
time
had
won
him
over
to
the
young
man
side
at
any
rate
as
soon
as
he
understood
that
orde
was
now
in
business
for
himself
he
readily
came
to
an
agreement
thereupon
crew
built
a
new
sluiceway
and
gate
far
enough
down
to
assure
a
good
head
in
the
pond

farther
down

agreements

on
a
ruddier

nondescript
neutral
colour
of

narrow

shades
he
did
his
work
and
figured
on

occasionally

little
trips
to

spent

said
nothing

stood
looking
while

folded
and
laid
away
his
head
bent
low
in
thought
then
she
placed
her
hand
for
an
instant
on
his
shoulder
and
went
away
the
ordes

not
a
demonstrative
people
the
journey
to
new
york
was
at
that
time
very
long
and
disagreeable
but
orde
bore
it
with
his
accustomed
stoicism
he
had
visited
the
metropolis
before
so
it
was
not
unfamiliar
to
him
he
was
very
glad
however
to
get
away
from
the
dust
and
monotony
of
the
railroad
train
the
september
twilight
was
just
falling
through
its
dusk

popping
into
illumination
as

his
rapid
way
orde
boarded
a
and
jingled
away
down
fourth
avenue
he
was
pleased
at
having
arrived
and
stretched
his
legs
and
filled
his
lungs
twice
with
so
evident
an
enjoyment
that
several
people
smiled
his
comfort
was
soon
disturbed
however
by
an
influx
of
people
boarding
the
car
at
street
the
seats
were
immediately
filled
and
late
comers
found
themselves
obliged
to
stand
in
the
aisle
among
these
were
several
women
the
men
nearest
buried
themselves
in
the
papers
after
the
almost
universal
metropolitan
custom
two
or
three
arose
to
offer
their
seats
among
them
orde
when
however
the
latter
had
turned
to
indicate
to
one
of
the
women
the
vacated
seat
he
discovered
it
occupied
by
a
chubby
and
flashily
dressed
youth
of
the
sort
common
enough
in
the
vicinity
of
fourteenth
street
impudent
of
eye
cynical
of
demeanour
and
slightly
contemptuous
of
everything
unaccustomed
he
had
slipped
in
back
of
orde
when
that
young
man
arose
whether
under
the
impression
that
orde
was
about
to
get
off
the
car
or
from
sheer
impudence
it
would
be
impossible
to

astonished

that
seat

him

the
youth

up
coolly

that
said
he
orde
wasted
no
time
in
discussion
which
no
doubt
saved
the
necessity
of
a
more
serious
disturbance
he
reached
over
suddenly
seized
the
youth
by
the
collar
braced
his
knee
against
the
seat
and
heaved
the
interloper
so
rapidly
to
his
feet
that
he
all
but
plunged
forward

the
passengers

opposite

her
embarrassment

his

about

before

recover
his
equilibrium

to
offer

to
the
open

such

the
incident

to
draw
orde
to
the
particular
notice
of
an
elderly
man

against
the
rear
rail
he
was
a
very
man
dressed
in
garments

the
product
of
the
highest
art

buttoned
up
well
brushed

cared
for
in
every
way
in
his
buttonhole
he
wore
a
pink
carnation
and
in
his
gloved
hand
he
carried
a
straight
cane
a
silk
hat
covered
his
head
from
beneath
which
showed
a
slightly
empurpled
countenance
with
bushy
white
eyebrows
a
white
moustache
and
a
pair
of
rather
bloodshot
but
kindly
blue
eyes
in
spite
of
his
somewhat
pudgy
rotundity
he
carried
himself
quite
erect
in
a
manner
that
bespoke
the
retired
military
man
have
courage
sir
said
this
gentleman
inclining
his
bead
gravely
to
orde
the
young
man
laughed
in
his
fashion
much
courage
required
to
root
out
that
kind
of
a
skunk
said
he
cheerfully
refer
to
the
courage
of
your
convictions
the
young
men
of
this
generation
seem
to
prefer
to
avoid
public
disturbances
that
breed
is
quite
capable
of
making
a
row
calling
the
police
raising
the
deuce
and
all
of
it
said
orde
the
elderly
gentleman
puffed
out
his
cheeks

from
the
west

he
stated
rather
than
asked
call
it
the
east
out
there
said
orde
should
call
that
pretty
far
west
said
the
old
gentleman
nothing
more
was
said
after
a
block
or
two
orde
descended
on
his
way
to
a
small
hotel
just
off
broadway
the
old
gentleman
saluted
orde
nodded
in
his
private
soul
he
was
a
little
amused
at
the
old
boy
to
his
view
a
man
and
clothes
carried
to
their
last
refinement
were
contradictory
terms
orde
ate
dressed
and
set
out
afoot
in
search
of
miss
bishop
address
he
arrived
in
front
of
the
house
a
little
past
eight
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
mounted
the
steps
and
rang
the
bell
the
door
swung
silently
back
to
frame
an
impassive
dressed
in
livery
to
orde
inquiry
he
stated
that
miss
bishop
had
gone
out
to
the
theatre
the
young
man
left
his
name
and
a
message
of
regret
at
this
the
footman
with
an
irony
so
subtle
as
to
be
quite
lost
on
orde
demanded
a
card
orde
scribbled
a
line
in
his
tore
it
out
folded
it
and
left
it
in
it
he
stated
his
regret
his
short
residence
in
the
city
and
desired
an
early
opportunity
to
call
then
he
departed
down
the
brownstone
steps
totally
unconscious
of
the
contempt
he
had
inspired
in
the
heart
of
the
liveried
man
behind
him
he
retired
early
and
arose
early
as
had
become
his
habit
when
he
descended
to
the
office
the
night
clerk
who
had
not
yet
been
relieved
handed
him
a
note
delivered
the
night
before
orde
ripped
it
open
eagerly
dear
orde
was
so
sorry
to
miss
you
that
evening
because
of
a
stupid
play
come
around
as
early
as
you
can
morning
i
shall
expect
you
yours
orde
glanced
at
the
clock
which
pointed
to
seven
he
breakfasted
read
the
morning
paper
finally
started
leisurely
in
the
direction
of
west
ninth
street
he
walked
slowly
so
as
to
consume
more
time
then
at
university
place
was
seized
with
a
panic
and
hurried
rapidly
to
his
destination
the
door
was
answered
by
the
same
man
who
had
opened
the
night
before
but
now
in
some
indefinable
way
his
calm
while
flawless
externally
seemed
to
have
lifted
to
a
mere
surface
as
though
he
might
hastily
have
assumed
his
coat
to
orde
inquiry
he
stated
with
great
brevity
that
miss
bishop
was
not
yet
visible
and
prepared
to
close
the
door
are
mistaken
said
orde
with
equal
brevity
and
stepped
inside
have
an
engagement
with
miss
bishop
tell
her
orde
is
the
man
departed
in
some
doubt
leaving
orde
standing
in
the
gloomy
hall
that
young
man
however
quite
cheerfully
parted
the
heavy
curtains
leading
into
a
parlour
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
at
his
entrance
a
maid
disappeared
out
another
door
carrying
with
her
the
implements
of
dusting
and
brushing
orde
looked
around
the
room
with
some
curiosity
it
was
long
narrow
and
very
high
tall
windows
admitted
light
at
one
end
the
illumination
was
however
modified
greatly
by
hangings
of
lace
covering
all
the
windows
supplemented
by
heavy
draperies
drawn
back
to
either
side
the
embrasure
was
occupied
by
a
small
table
over
which
seemed
to
flutter
a
beautiful
marble
psyche
a
rubber
plant
then
as
now
the
mark
of
the
city
and
suburban
dweller
sent
aloft
its
spare
shiny
leaves
alongside
a
closed
square
piano
the
lack
of
ornaments
atop
the
latter
bespoke
the
musician
through
the
filtered
gloom
of
the
orde
surveyed
with
interest
the
excellent
reproductions
of
the
old
world
masterpieces
framed
on
the
walls
by
raphael
murillo
and
perugino
the
lisa
and
botticelli
the
three
oil
portraits
occupying
the
large
spaces
the
chairs
and
tables
the
tea
service
in
the
corner
the
tall
bronze
lamp
by
the
piano
the
neat
little
with
its
mantel
of
marble
the
ormolu
clock
all
the
decorous
and
decorated
gentility
which
marked
the
irreproachable
correctness
of
whoever
had
furnished
the
apartment
dark
and
heavy
hangings
depended
in
front
of
a
double
door
leading
into
another
room
beyond
equally
dark
and
heavy
hangings
had
closed
behind
orde
as
he
entered
an
absolute
and
shrouded
stillness
seemed
to
settle
down
upon
him
the
ormolu
clock
ticked
steadily
muffled
sounds
came
at
long
intervals
from
behind
the
portieres
orde
began
to
feel
oppressed
and
subdued
for
quite
three
quarters
of
an
hour
he
waited
without
hearing
any
other
indications
of
life
than
the
muffled
sounds
just
remarked
upon
occasionally
he
shifted
his
position
but
cautiously
as
though
he
feared
to
awaken
some
one
the
three
oil
portraits
stared
at
him
with
all
the
reserved
aloofness
of
their
painted
eyes
he
began
to
doubt
whether
the
man
had
announced
him
at
all
then
breaking
the
stillness
with
almost
startling
abruptness
he
heard
a
clear
high
voice
saying
something
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
outside
a
rhythmical
swish
of
skirts
punctuated
by
the
light
of
a
girl
tripping
downstairs
brought
him
to
his
feet
a
moment
later
the
curtains
parted
and
she
entered
holding
out
her
hand
i
did
keep
you
waiting
such
a
long
time
she
cried
he
stood
holding
her
hand
suddenly
unable
to
say
a
word
looking
at
her
hungrily
a
flood
of
emotion
of
which
he
had
had
no
prevision
swelled
up
within
him
to
fill
his
throat
an
almost
irresistible
impulse
all
but
controlled
him
to
crush
her
to
him
to
kiss
her
lips
and
her
throat
to
lose
his
fingers
in
the
soft
shadowy
fineness
of
her
hair
the
crest
of
the
wave
passed
almost
immediately
but
it
left
him
shaken
a
faint
colour
deepened
under
the
transparence
of
her
skin
her
fathomless
black
eyes
widened
ever
so
little
she
released
her
hand
was
good
of
you
to
come
so
promptly
said
she
so
anxious
to
hear
all
about
the
dear
people
at
she
settled
gracefully
in
one
of
the
little
chairs
orde
sat
down
once
more
master
of
himself
but
still
inclined
to
devour
her
with
his
gaze
she
was
dressed
in
a
morning
gown
all
laces
and
ribbons
and
long
flowing
lines
her
hair
was
done
low
on
the
back
of
her
head
and
on
the
nape
of
her
neck
the
blood
ebbed
and
flowed
beneath
her
clear
skin
a
faint
fragrance
of
cleanliness
diffused
itself
about
her
the
cool
sweet
fragrance
of
daintiness
they
entered
busily
into
conversation
her
attitudes
were
no
longer
relaxed
and
languidly
graceful
as
in
the
easy
chairs
under
the
lamplight
she
sat
forward
her
hands
crossed
on
her
lap
a
fire
smouldering
deep
beneath
the
cool
surface
lights
of
her
eyes
the
sounds
in
the
next
room
increased
in
volume
as
though
several
people
must
have
entered
that
apartment
in
a
moment
or
so
the
curtains
to
the
hall
parted
to
frame
the
servant
bishop
wishes
to
know
miss
said
that
functionary
not
coming
to
orde
sprang
to
his
feet
you
had
your
breakfast
yet
he
cried
conscience
stricken
you
gather
the
fact
that

just
up
she
mocked
him

you
it
does
matter
the
family

just
come

orde

here
until
nine
i
thought
of
course

around
i
mighty
sorry

she
cried
cutting
him
short
a
bother
about
nothing
do
you
see
i
ahead
a
whole
hour
of
good
see
you
told
me
in
your
note
to
come

orde
forgot
you
were
one
of
those
dreadful
outdoor
men
you
did
see
any
worms

you
next
time
i
tell
you
to
come
the
day
orde
was
for
taking
his
leave
but
this
she
would
not
have
must
meet
my
family
she
negatived
if
you
here
for
so
short
a
time
we
want
to
see
something
of
you
come
right
out
orde
thereupon
followed
her
down
a
narrow
dark
hall
squeezed
between
the
stairs
and
the
wall
to
a
door
that
opened
slantwise
into
a
the
exact
counterpart
in
shape
to
the
parlour
at
the
other
side
of
the
house
only
in
this
case
the
morning
sun
and
more
diaphanous
curtains
lent
an
air
of
brightness
further
enhanced
by
a
wire
stand
of
flowers
in
the
the
centre
of
the
room
was
occupied
by
a
round
table
about
which
were
grouped
several
people
of
different
ages
with
her
back
to
the
sat
a
woman
well
beyond
middle
age
but
with
evidently
some
pretensions
to
youth
she
was
tall
desiccated
quick
in
movement
dark
rings
below
her
eyes
attested
either
a
nervous
disease
an
hysterical
temperament
or
both
immediately
at
her
left
sat
a
boy
of
about
fourteen
years
of
age
his
face
a
curious
contradiction
between
a
naturally
frank
and
open
expression
and
a
growing
sullenness
next
him
stood
a
vacant
chair
evidently
for
miss
bishop
opposite
lolled
a
young
man
holding
a
newspaper
in
one
hand
and
a
coffee
cup
in
the
other
he
was
very
handsome
with
a
drooping
black
moustache
dark
eyes
under
lashes
almost
too
luxuriant
and
a
long
oval
face
dark
in
complexion
and
a
trifle
sardonic
in
expression
in
the
to
bishop
orde
was
surprised
to
find
his
friend
of
the
street
car
miss
bishop
performed
the
necessary
introductions
which
each
acknowledged
after
his
fashion
but
with
an
apparent
indifference
that
dashed
orde
accustomed
to
a
more
western
cordiality
bishop
held
out
a
languidly
graceful
hand
the
boy
mumbled
a
greeting
the
young
man
nodded
lazily
over
his
newspaper
only
general
bishop
recognising
him
arose
and
grasped
his
hand
with
a
real
though
rather
fussy
warmth
dear
sir
he
cried
am
honoured
to
see
you
again
this
my
dear
he
addressed
his
wife
the
young
man
i
was
telling
you
about
in
the
street
car
he
explained
very
interesting
said
bishop
with
evidently
no
comprehension
and
less
interest
gerald
bishop
cast
an
ironically
amused
glance
across
at
orde
the
boy
looked
up
at
him
quickly
the
sullenness
for
a
moment
gone
from
his
face
carroll
bishop
appeared
quite
unconscious
of
an
atmosphere
which
seemed
to
orde
strained
but
sank
into
her
place
at
the
table
and
unfolded
her
napkin
the
silent
butler
drew
forward
a
chair
for
orde
and
stood
looking
impassively
in
bishop
direction
will
have
some
breakfast
with
us
she
inquired
a
cup
of
coffee
at
least
she
began
to
manipulate
the
coffee
pot
without
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
orde
disclaimer
the
general
puffed
out
his
cheeks
and
coughed
a
bit
in
embarrassment
good
cup
of
coffee
is
never
amiss
to
an
old
campaigner
he
said
to
orde
as
good
as
a
full
meal
in
a
pinch
i
remember
when
i
was
a
major
in
the
eleventh
down
near
the
city
of
mexico
in
the
time
hardy
command
was
so
nearly
wiped
out
by
that
viaduct
he
half
turned
toward
orde
his
face
lighting
up
his
fingers
reaching
for
the
fork
with
which
after
the
custom
of
old
soldiers
to
trace
the
chart
of
his
reminiscences
bishop
rattled
her
cup
and
saucer
with
an
uncontrollably
nervous
jerk
of
her
slender
body
for
some
moments
she
had
awaited
a
chance
to
get
the
general
attention
us
father
she
said
brusquely
you
have
another
cup
of
coffee
the
old
gentleman
arrested
in
swallowed
looked
a
trifle
bewildered
but
subsided
meekly
thank
you
my
dear
said
he
and
went
furiously
at
his
breakfast
orde
overwhelmed
by
embarrassment
discovered
that
none
of
the
others
had
paid
the
incident
the
slightest
attention
only
on
the
lips
of
gerald
bishop
he
surprised
a
fine
detached
smile
at
this
moment
the
butler
entered
bearing
the
mail
bishop
tore
hers
open
rapidly
dropping
the
mangled
envelopes
at
her
side
the
contents
of
one
seemed
to
vex
her
she
cried
aloud
miserable
marie
she
promised
me
to
have
it
done
and
now
she
puts
it
off
until
monday
it
too
provoking
she
turned
to
orde
for
sympathy
you
know
anything
more
aggravating
than
to
work
and
slave
to
the
limit
of
endurance
and
then
have
everything
upset
by
the
stupidity
of
some
one
else
orde
murmured
an
appropriate
reply
to
which
bishop
paid
no
attention
whatever
she
started
suddenly
up
from
the
table
must
see
about
it
she
cried
plainly
see
i
shall
have
to
do
it
myself
i
will
do
it
myself
i
promised
it
for
must
do
another
stitch
mother
put
in
carroll
bishop
decidedly
know
what
the
doctor
told
you
you
have
yourself
down
see
for
yourself
cried
bishop
what
comes
of
leaving
things
to
others
if
i
done
it
myself
it
would
have
saved
me
all
this
bother
and
fuss
and
it
would
have
been
done
and
now
i
got
to
do
it
dear
put
in
the
general
carroll
can
see
marie
about
it
in
any
case
there
nothing
to
work
yourself
up
into
such
an
excitement
very
easy
for
you
to
talk
is
it
cried
bishop
turning
on
him
like
the
way
you
all
sit
around
like
lumps
and
do
nothing
and
then
tell
me
how
i
ought
to
have
done
it
john
have
the
carriage
around
at
she
turned
tensely
to
orde
hope
you
excuse
me
she
said
very
briefly
have
something
very
important
to
attend
carroll
had
also
risen
orde
held
out
his
hand
must
be
going
said
he
she
conceded
suppose
i
better
see
if
i
ca
help
mother
out
but
you
come
in
again
come
and
dine
with
us
this
evening
mother
will
be
as
bishop
had
departed
from
the
room
orde
had
to
take
for
granted
the
expression
of
this
delight
he
bowed
to
the
other
occupants
of
the
table
the
general
was
eating
nervously
gerald
eyes
were
fixed
amusedly
on
orde
to
orde
surprise
he
was
almost
immediately
joined
on
the
street
by
young
bishop
most
correctly
appointed
anywhere
in
particular
he
inquired
go
up
the
avenue
then
everybody
will
be
they
turned
up
the
great
promenade
a
tour
of
which
was
then
even
more
than
now
considered
obligatory
on
the
gracefully
idle
neither
said
anything
orde
because
he
was
too
absorbed
in
the
emotions
this
sudden
revelation
of
carroll
environment
had
aroused
in
him
gerald
apparently
because
he
was
too
indifferent
nevertheless
it
was
the
young
exquisite
who
finally
broke
the
silence
was
an
altar
cloth
said
he
suddenly
asked
orde
rather
bewildered
is
probably
the
most
devout
woman
in
new
york
went
on
even
voice
is
one
of
the
hardest
workers
in
the
church
she
keeps
all
the
fast
days
and
attends
all
the
services
although
she
has
no
strength
to
speak
of
she
has
just
completed
an
elaborate
embroidered
altar
cloth
the
work
she
accomplished
while
on
her
knees
often
she
spent
five
or
six
hours
a
day
in
that
position
it
was
very
devout
but
against
the
doctor
orders
and
she
is
at
present
much
pulled
down
finally
she
gave
way
to
persuasion
to
the
extent
of
sending
the
embroidery
out
to
be
bound
and
corded
as
a
result
the
altar
cloth
will
not
be
done
for
next
he
delivered
this
statement
in
a
voice
absolutely
colourless
without
the
faintest
trace
discernible
of
either
approval
or
disapproval
without
the
slightest
irony
yet
orde
felt
vaguely
uncomfortable
must
have
been
annoying
to
her
he
said
gravely
i
hope
she

my

i

that
my
mother

ardent

on
her

gerald
with
his
cool
impersonal
courtesy
was
too
bad
just
before
the
chance
for
more
service

replied
briefly
but
forced
by
the
direct
cold
and
polite
of
his

he
gave
the

a
succinct
idea
of
the
sort
of
operations
in
which
he
was
interested

said
at

my

my
horse
and
my
there
anything
that
particularly
attracts
you
asked
orde
the
young
man
languid
eyes
grew
thoughtful
and
he
puffed
more
strongly

his
cigarette

like
said
he
slowly
at
last
enter
the
do
you
asked
orde
bluntly
family
reasons
make
it
inexpedient
at
present
said
gerald
mother
is
in
a
very
nervous
state
she
depends
on
us
and
any
hint
of
our
leaving
her
is
sufficient
to
render
her
condition
by
this
time
the
two
young
men
were
well
uptown
on
gerald
initiative
they
turned
down
a
side
street
and
shortly
came
to
a
stop
is
my
gymnasium
said
gerald
pointing
to
a
building
across
the
way
you
come
in
with
me
i
am
due
now
for
my
xvii
orde
evening
was
a
disappointment
to
him
bishop
had
by
carroll
report
worked
feverishly
at
the
altar
cloth
all
the
afternoon
as
a
consequence
she
had
gone
to
bed
with
a
bad
headache
this
state
of
affairs
seemed
to
throw
the
entire
family
into
a
state
of
indecision
it
was
divided
in
mind
as
to
what
to
do
the
absolute
inutility
of
any
effort
balancing
strongly
against
a
sense
of
what
the
invalid
expected
wonder
if
mother
would
like
just
a
taste
of
this
beef
speculated
the
general
moving
fussily
in
his
chair
believe
somebody
ought
to
take
some
up
she
might
want
the
man
departed
with
the
plate
but
returned
a
few
moments
later
impassive
but
still
with
the
plate
she
got
her
bag
asked
the
boy
unexpectedly
master
kendrick
replied
the
butler
after
a
preoccupied
silence
the
general
again
broke
out
to
me
somebody
ought
to
be
up
there
with
know
father
that
she
ca
stand
any
one
in
the
room
said
carroll
equably
toward
the
close
of
the
meal
however
a
distant
bell
tinkled
faintly
every
one
jumped
as
though
guilty
carroll
said
a
hasty
excuse
and
ran
out
after
ringing
the
bell
the
invalid
had
evidently
anticipated
its
answer
by
emerging
from
her
room
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
for
orde
caught
the
sharp
tones
of
complaint
and
overheard
something
about
all
night
to
eat
a
simple
meal
when
i
lying
here
at
the
end
of
an
interval
a
maid
appeared
in
the
doorway
to
say
that
miss
carroll
sent
word
she
would
not
be
down
again
for
a
time
and
did
not
care
for
any
more
dinner
this
seemed
to
relieve
the
general
mind
of
responsibility
he
assumed
his
little
fussy
air
of
cheerfulness
told
several
stories
of
the
war
and
finally
after
kendrick
had
left
brought
out
some
whisky
and
water
he
winked
slyly
at
orde
do
this
before
the
youngsters
you
know
he
chirruped
craftily
throughout
the
meal
gerald
had
sat
back
silent
a
faint
amusement
in
his
eye
after
dinner
he
arose
yawned
consulted
his
watch
and
departed
pleading
an
engagement
orde
lingered
some
time
listening
to
the
general
in
the
hope
that
carroll
would
reappear
she
did
not
so
finally
he
took
his
leave
he
trudged
back
to
his
hotel
gloomily
the
day
had
passed
in
a
most
unsatisfactory
manner
according
to
his
way
of
looking
at
it
yet
he
had
come
more
clearly
to
an
understanding
of
the
girl
her
cheerfulness
her
unselfishness
and
above
all
the
sweet
beautiful
philosophy
of
life
that
must
lie
back
to
render
her
so
uncomplainingly
the
slave
of
the
woman
yet
without
the
indifferent
cynicism
of
gerald
the
sullen
yet
real
partisanship
of
kendrick
or
the
general
acquiescence
the
next
morning
he
succeeded
in
making
an
arrangement
by
letter
for
an
excursion
to
the
newly
projected
central
park
promptly
at
two
he
was
at
the
bishops
house
to
his
inquiry
the
butler
said
that
bishop
had
recovered
from
her
indisposition
and
that
miss
bishop
would
be
down
immediately
orde
had
not
long
to
wait
for
her
the
swish
of
her
joyous
descent
of
the
stairs
brought
him
to
his
feet
she
swept
aside
the
portieres
and
stood
between
their
folds
bidding
him
welcome
so
sorry
about
last
night
said
she
poor
mother
does
depend
on
me
so
at
such
times
is
it
a
gorgeous
day
to
walk
it
wo
be
much
like
our
woods
will
it
but
it
will
be
something
oh
i
so
glad
to
get
out
she
was
in
one
of
her
elfish
moods
the
languid
grace
of
her
moments
forgotten
with
a
little
cry
of
rapture
she
ran
to
the
piano
and
dashed
into
a
gay
tinkling
air
with
brilliancy
and
abandon
her
head
surmounted
by
a
perky
hat
with
a
flaming
red
bird
in
front
glorified
by
the
braid
and
of
that
day
bent
forward
and
turned
to
flash
an
appeal
for
sympathy
toward
orde
i
feel
more
able
to
stay
on
earth
she
cried
springing
to
her
feet
i
get
on
my
gloves
and
we
she
turned
slowly
before
the
mirror
examining
quite
frankly
the
hang
of
her
skirt
the
fit
of
her
waist
the
turn
of
the
adorable
round
collars
that
were
then
the
mode
pays
to
be
particular
we
are
in
new
york
she
answered
or
parried
orde
glance
of
admiration
the
gloves
finally
drawn
on
and
buttoned
orde
held
aside
the
portieres
and
she
passed
fairly
under
his
uplifted
hand
he
wanted
to
drop
his
arm
about
her
this
slender
girl
with
her
quaint
dignity
her
ways
her
gentle
graceful
mysterious
feminine
soul
the
bird
lent
its
colour
to
her
cheeks
her
eyes
black
and
fathomless
the
pupils
wide
in
this
dim
light
shone
with
two
stars
of
delight
but
as
they
moved
toward
the
massive
front
doors
bishop
came
down
the
stairs
behind
them
she
too
was
dressed
for
the
street
she
received
orde
greeting
and
congratulation
over
her
improved
health
in
rather
an
absent
manner
indeed
as
soon
as
she
could
hurry
this
preliminary
over
she
plunged
into
what
evidently
she
considered
a
more
important
matter
are
thinking
of
going
out
are
you
she
asked
carroll
told
you
mother
do
you
remember
orde
and
i
are
going
to
get
a
little
air
in
the
sorry
said
bishop
with
great
brevity
and
decision
i
going
to
the
rectory
to
help
merritt
and
i
shall
want
you
to
go
too
to
see
about
the
mother
expostulated
carroll
marie
do
just
as
well
know
very
well
she
ca
be
trusted
without
do
so
want
to
go
to
the
park
said
carroll
wistfully
thin
nervous
figure
jerked
spasmodically
is
very
little
asked
of
you
from
morning
until
night
she
said
with
some
asperity
i
should
think
you
have
some
slight
consideration
for
the
fact
that
just
up
from
a
sick
bed
to
spare
me
all
you
could
besides
which
you
do
very
little
for
the
church
i
wo
insist
do
exactly
as
you
think
carroll
threw
a
pathetic
glance
at
orde
soon
are
you
going
she
asked
her
mother
about
ten
minutes
replied
bishop
soon
as
i
seen
honorine
about
the
she
seemed
abruptly
to
realise
that
the
amenities
demanded
something
of
her
sorry
we
must
go
so
soon
she
said
briefly
to
orde
of
course
church
business
we
shall
hope
to
see
you
once
more
orde
held
aside
the
curtains
the
drooped
from
the
twilight
of
the
hall
into
the
dimness
of
the
parlour
all
the
brightness
seemed
to
have
drained
from
the
day
and
all
the
joy
of
life
seemed
to
have
faded
from
the
girl
soul
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
tried
pathetically
to
smile
across
at
orde
such
a
baby
about
disappointments
said
she
know
he
replied
very
gently
it
such
a
blue
and
gold
know
he
repeated
she
twisted
her
glove
in
her
lap
a
bright
spot
of
colour
burning
in
each
cheek
is
not
well
and
she
has
a
great
deal
to
try
her
poor
mother
she
said
softly
her
head
cast
down
know
said
orde
in
his
gentle
tones
after
a
moment
he
arose
to
go
she
remained
seated
her
head
down
sorry
about
this
afternoon
said
he
cheerfully
it
be
helped
could
it
jane
used
to
tell
me
about
your
harp
playing
going
to
come
in
to
hear
you
this
evening
may
i
she
said
in
a
stifled
voice
and
held
out
her
hand
she
sat
quite
still
until
she
heard
the
front
door
close
after
him
then
she
ran
to
the
curtains
and
looked
after
his
sturdy
square
figure
as
it
swung
up
the
street
done
oh
well
done
gentle
heart
she
breathed
after
him
then
she
went
back
to
the
piano
but
orde
mouth
could
she
have
seen
it
was
set
in
grim
lines
and
his
feet
could
she
have
heard
them
rang
on
the
pavement
with
quite
superfluous
vigour
he
turned
to
the
left
and
without
pause
walked
some
ten
or
twelve
miles
the
evening
turned
out
very
well
fortunately
orde
could
not
have
stood
much
more
they
had
the
parlour
quite
to
themselves
carroll
took
the
cover
from
the
tall
harp
and
leaning
her
cheek
against
it
she
played
dreamily
for
a
half
hour
her
arms
were
bare
and
as
her
fingers
reached
out
lingeringly
and
caressingly
to
draw
the
pure
golden
chords
from
the
golden
instrument
her
soft
bosom
pressed
against
the
broad
sounding
board
there
is
about
the
tones
of
a
harp
well
played
something
luminous
like
rich
warm
sunlight
when
the
girl
muted
the
strings
at
last
it
seemed
to
orde
as
though
all
at
once
the
room
had
perceptibly
darkened
he
took
his
leave
finally
his
spirit
soothed
and
restored
tranquillity
was
not
for
long
however
orde
visits
were
naturally
as
frequent
as
possible
to
them
almost
instantly
bishop
opposed
the
strong
and
intuitive
jealousy
of
egotism
she
had
as
yet
no
fears
as
to
the
young
man
intentions
but
instinctively
she
felt
an
influence
that
opposed
her
own
supreme
dominance
in
consequence
orde
had
much
time
to
himself
carroll
and
the
rest
of
the
family
with
the
possible
exception
of
gerald
shared
the
belief
that
the
slightest
real
opposition
to
bishop
would
suffice
to
throw
her
into
one
of
her
a
condition
of
alarming
and
possibly
genuine
collapse
drive
mother
into
a
was
an
expression
of
the
worst
possible
domestic
crime
it
accused
the
perpetrator
through
bishop
of
forgetting
the
state
of
affairs
of
ingratitude
for
care
and
affection
of
common
inhumanity
and
of
impiety
in
rendering
impossible
of
performance
the
multifarious
church
duties
bishop
had
invented
and
assumed
as
so
many
particularly
shining
virtues
orde
soon
discovered
that
carroll
went
out
in
society
very
little
for
the
simple
reason
that
she
could
never
give
an
unqualified
acceptance
to
an
invitation
at
the
last
moment
when
she
had
donned
her
street
wraps
and
the
carriage
was
at
the
door
she
was
liable
to
be
called
back
either
to
assist
at
some
religious
function
which
by
its
sacred
character
was
supposed
to
have
precedence
over
everything
or
to
attend
a
nervous
crisis
brought
on
by
some
member
of
the
household
or
by
mere
untoward
circumstances
the
girl
always
acquiesced
most
sweetly
in
these
recurrent
disappointments
and
the
very
fact
that
she
accepted
few
invitations
gave
orde
many
more
chances
to
see
her
in
spite
of
bishop
increasing
exactions
he
did
not
realise
this
fact
however
but
ground
his
teeth
and
clung
to
his
temper
whenever
the
mother
cut
short
his
visits
or
annulled
his
engagements
on
some
petty
excuse
of
her
own
he
could
almost
believe
these
interruptions
malicious
were
it
not
that
he
soon
discovered
bishop
well
disposed
toward
him
personally
whenever
he
showed
himself
ready
to
meet
her
even
quarter
way
on
the
topics
that
interested
her
the
church
and
her
health
in
this
manner
the
week
passed
orde
saw
as
much
as
he
could
of
miss
bishop
the
remainder
of
the
time
he
spent
walking
the
streets
and
reading
in
the
club
rooms
to
which
gerald
courtesy
had
given
him
access
gerald
himself
seemed
to
be
much
occupied
precisely
at
eleven
every
morning
however
he
appeared
at
the
gymnasium
for
his
practice
and
in
this
orde
dropped
into
the
habit
of
joining
him
when
the
young
men
first
stripped
in
each
other
presence
they
eyed
each
other
with
a
secret
surprise
gerald
slender
and
elegant
body
turned
out
to
be
smoothly
and
gracefully
muscled
on
the
long
lines
of
the
flying
mercury
his
bones
were
small
but
his
flesh
was
hard
and
his
skin
healthy
with
the
flow
of
blood
beneath
orde
on
the
other
hand
had
earned
from
the
river
the
torso
of
an
ancient
athlete
the
round
full
arch
of
his
chest
was
topped
by
a
mass
of
muscle
across
his
back
beneath
the
smooth
skin
the
muscles
rippled
and
ridged
and
dimpled
with
every
movement
the
beautiful
curve
of
the
deltoids
from
the
point
of
the
shoulder
to
the
arm

the
other
beautiful
curve
of
the
unflexed
biceps
and
that
fulness
of
the
back
arm
so
often
lacking
in
a
development

surface
of
the
abdomen
showed
the
peculiar
corrugation
of
the
very
strong
man

from

asked
the
handler

puzzled
i

i
was
always
pretty
heavy
and
i
suppose
the
work
on
the
river
keeps
a
man
in
pretty
good
gerald
languor
had
vanished
and
a
glint
had
appeared
in
his
eye
that
would
have
reminded
orde
of
miss
bishop
most
mischievous
mood
could
he
have
seen
it
on
the
gloves

murphy
he
suggested
you
i
like
to
see
you

at
agreed
orde
not
much
good
at
it
but
just
as
soon
he
was
evidently
not
in
the
least
afraid
to
meet
the
handler
though
as
evidently
without
much
confidence
in
his
own
skill

i

with
you

in
the
anteroom
he

a
bell
and

the

leisurely
answered
its
summons
he
said
rapidly
over
to
the
club
and
find
winslow
clark
and
whoever
else
is
in
the
smoking
room
and
tell
them
from
me
to
come
over
to
the
gymnasium
tell
them
there
some
fun
then
he
returned
to
the
gymnasium
floor
where
murphy
was
answering
orde
questions
as
to
the
apparatus
while
the
two
men
were
pulling
on
the
gloves
gerald
managed
a
word
apart
with
the
trainer
you
do
him
murph
he
whispered
said
the
handler
kind
always
as
slow
as
they
gets
it
to
him
said
gerald
do
kill
him
he
a
friend
of
then
he
stepped
back
the
same
joy
in
his
soul
that
inspires
a
riverman
when
he
encounters
a
a
hunter
when
he
takes
out
a
greenhorn
or
a
cowboy
as
he
watches
the
tenderfoot
about
to
climb
the
bronco
said
he
the
first
round
was
sharp
when
gerald
called
the
end
orde
grinned
at
him
cheerfully
look
like
i
was
much
at
this
game
does
it
said
he
pull
down
many
persimmons
out
of
that
tree
your
confounded
man
too
lively
i
could
hit
him
with
a
orde
had
stood
like
a
rock
his
feet
planted
to
the
floor
while
murphy
had
circled
around
him
hitting
at
will
orde
hit
back
but
without
landing
nevertheless
murphy
when
questioned
apart
did
not
seem
satisfied
man
said
he
punched
him
plenty
hard
enough
and
it
did
seem
to
jar
the
gallery
at
one
end
the
running
track
had
by
now
half
filled
with
interested
spectators
called
gerald
for
round
two
this
time
murphy
went
in
more
viciously
aiming
and
measuring
his
blows
accurately
orde
stood
as
before
a
humourous
smile
of
on
his
face
hitting
back
at
the
elusive
murphy
but
without
much
effect
his
feet
never
stirring
in
their
tracks
the
handler
used
his
best
tactics
and
landed
almost
at
will
but
without
apparent
damage
he
grew
ugly
finally
lost
his
head
if
ye
will
have
it
he
muttered
and
aimed
what
was
intended
as
a
knockout
blow
gerald
uttered
a
half
cry
of
warning
as
his
practised
eye
caught
murphy
intention
the
blow
landed
orde
head
snapped
back
but
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
the
punch
had
no
other
effect
and
a
quick
exchange
of
infighting
sent
murphy
staggering
back
from
the
encounter
the
smile
had
disappeared
from
orde
face
and
his
eye
had
calmed
here
he
called
to
gerald
do
understand
this
game
very
well
at
school
we
used
is
a
man
supposed
to
hit
hard
gerald
hesitated
then
looked
beyond
orde
to
the
gallery
to
a
man
it
made
frantic
and
silent
demonstration
course
you
hit
he
replied
ca
hurt
any
one
with
those
big
orde
turned
back
to
his
antagonist
the
latter
advanced
once
more
his
bullet
head
sunk
between
his
shoulders
his
little
eyes
twinkling
evidently
bishop
friend
would
now
take
the
aggressive
and
forward
movement
would
deliver
an
extra
force
to
the
professional
blows
orde
did
not
wait
for
murphy
however
like
a
tiger
he
sprang
forward
hitting
out
fiercely
first
with
one
hand
then
with
the
other
murphy
gave
ground
blocked
ducked
exerted
all
a
ring
general
skill
either
to
stop
or
avoid
the
rush
orde
followed
him
insistent
several
times
he
landed
but
always
when
murphy
was
on
the
retreat
so
the
blows
had
not
much
weight
several
times
murphy
ducked
in
and
planted
a
number
of
jabs
at
close
range
the
round
ended
almost
immediately
to
a
storm
of
applause
from
the
galleries
do
you
think
of
his
being
gerald
asked
murphy
as
the
latter
flung
himself
panting
on
the
wrestling
mat
for
his
rest
quick
as
chained
lightning
acknowledged
the
other
grudgingly
i
get
him
he
ca
keep
that
up
he
be
winded
in
half
a
orde
sat
down
on
a
roll
of
mat
his
smile
had
quite
vanished
and
he
seemed
to
be
awaiting
eagerly
the
beginning
of
the
next
round
called
gerald
for
the
third
orde
immediately
sprang
at
his
adversary
repeating
the
headlong
rush
with
which
the
previous
round
had
ended
murphy
blocked
ducked
and
kept
away
occasionally
delivering
a
jolt
as
opportunity
offered
awaiting
the
time
when
orde
weariness
would
leave
him
at
the
mercy
that
moment
did
not
come
the
young
man
hammered
away
tirelessly
insistently
delivering
a
hurricane
of
his
blows
pressing
relentlessly
in
as
murphy
shifted
and
gave
ground
his
head
up
his
eyes
steady
oblivious
to
the
return
hammering
the
now
desperate
handler
opposed
to
him
two
minutes
passed
without
perceptible
slackening
in
this
terrific
pace
the
gallery
was
in
an
uproar
and
some
of
the
members
were
piling
down
the
stairs
to
the
floor
perspiration
stood
out
all
over
murphy
body
his
blows
failed
of
their
effect
and
some
of
orde
were
landing
at
length
bewildered
more
by
the
continuance
than
the
violence
of
the
attack
he
dropped
his
ring
tactics
and
closed
in
to
straight
slugging
blow
against
blow
stand
up
give
and
take
as
he
saw
his
opponent
stand
orde
uttered
a
sound
of
satisfaction
he
dropped
slightly
his
right
shoulder
behind
his
next
blow
the
glove
crashed
straight
as
a
through
murphy
upraised
hands
to
his
face
which
it
met
with
a
smack
the
trainer
lifted
bodily
from
the
ground
was
hurled
through
the
air
to
land
doubled
up
against
the
supports
of
a
parallel
bars
there
he
lay
quite
still
his
palms
up
his
head
sunk
forward
orde
stared
at
him
a
moment
in
astonishment
as
though
expecting
him
to
arise
when
however
he
perceived
that
murphy
was
in
reality
unconscious
he
tore
off
the
gloves
and
ran
forward
to
kneel
by
the
professional
side
did
suppose
one
punch
like
that
would
hurt
him
he
muttered
to
the
men
crowding
around
with
the
gloves
do
you
suppose
he
killed
but
already
murphy
arms
were
making
aimless
motions
and
a
deep
breath
raised
his
chest
just
knocked
out
reassured
one
of
the
men
examining
the
prostrate
handler
with
a
professional
attention
be
as
good
as
ever
in
five
minutes
here
he
commanded
one
of
the
gymnasium
rubbers
who
had
appeared
a
hand
here
with
some
the
clubmen
crowded
about
all
talking
at
once
a
wonder
my
friend
said
one
jove
he
hardly
breathing
fast
after
all
that
rushing
said
a
second
you
did
think
one
punch
like
that
would
hurt
him
quoted
another
with
sarcasm
said
orde
simply
hit
men
that
hard
before
with
my
bare
they
survive
kind
of
were
they
in
heaven
name
orde
had
recovered
his
balance
and
humour
plain
ordinary
rivermen
said
he
with
a
laugh
struck
in
gerald
want
to
introduce
you
to
my
he
performed
the
introductions
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
explain
apart
that
orde
was
in
reality
his
friend
an
amateur
a
chance
visitor
in
the
city
all
in
all
the
affair
made
quite
a
little
stir
and
went
far
to
give
orde
a
standing
with
these
youths
finally
gerald
and
orde
were
permitted
to
finish
their
gymnasium
practice
murphy
had
recovered
and
came
forward
have
a
strong
punch
sir
and
you
a
born
natural
fighter
sir
said
he
you
had
a
few
lessons
in
boxing
sir
i
put
you
against
the
but
later
when
the
young
men
were
resting
each
under
his
sheet
after
a
the
true
significance
of
the
affair
for
orde
came
out
since
the
fight
gerald
customary
lassitude
of
manner
seemed
quite
to
have
left
him
his
eye
was
bright
a
colour
mounted
beneath
the
pale
olive
of
his
skin
the
almost
effeminate
beauty
of
his
countenance
had
animated
he
looked
across
at
orde
several
times
hesitated
and
at
last
decided
to
speak
here
orde
said
he
want
to
confess
something
to
you
when
you
first
came
here
three
days
ago
i
had
lots
of
fun
with
myself
about
you
you
know
your
clothes
are
quite
the
thing
and
i
thought
your
manner
was
queer
and
all
that
i
was
a
cad
i
want
to
apologise
a
man
and
i
like
you
better
than
any
fellow
i
met
for
a
long
time
and
if
there
any
trouble
in
the
future
that
is
oh
hang
it
i
on
your
side
you
know
what
i
mean
orde
smiled
slowly
was
his
unexpected
reply
not
near
so
much
of
a
dandy
as
you
think
you
xviii
affairs
went
thus
for
a
week
orde
was
much
at
the
bishop
residence
where
he
was
cordially
received
by
the
general
where
he
gained
an
occasional
with
carroll
and
where
he
was
almost
ignored
by
bishop
in
her
complete
indeed
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
he
attained
any
real
individuality
to
that
lady
who
looked
on
all
the
world
outside
her
family
as
useful
or
useless
to
the
church
in
the
course
of
the
happy
moments
he
had
alone
with
carroll
he
arrived
at
a
more
intimate
plane
of
conversation
with
her
he
came
to
an
understanding
of
her
unquestioning
acceptance
of
bishop
attitude
carroll
truly
believed
that
none
but
herself
could
perform
for
her
mother
the
various
petty
offices
that
lady
demanded
from
her
next
of
kin
and
that
her
practical
slavery
was
due
by
every
consideration
of
filial
affection
to
orde
occasional
tentative
suggestion
that
the
service
was
of
a
sort
better
suited
to
a
paid
companion
or
even
a
housemaid
she
answered
quite
seriously
that
it
made
mother
nervous
to
have
others
about
her
and
that
it
was
better
to
do
these
things
than
to
throw
her
into
a
orde
chafed
at
first
over
seeing
his
precious
opportunities
thus
filched
from
him
later
he
fretted
because
he
perceived
that
carroll
was
forced
however
willingly
to
labours
beyond
her
strength
to
irksome
confinement
and
to
that
intimate
and
wearing
close
association
with
the
abnormal
which
in
the
long
run
is
bound
to
deaden
the
spirit
he
lost
sight
of
his
own
grievance
in
the
matter
with
perhaps
somewhat
of
exaggeration
he
came
mightily
to
desire
for
her
more
of
the
open
air
both
of
body
and
spirit
often
when
tramping
back
to
his
hotel
he
communed
savagely
with
himself
turning
the
problem
over
and
over
in
his
mind
until
like
a
snowball
it
had
gathered
to
itself
colossal
proportions
and
in
his
hotel
room
he
brooded
over
the
state
of
affairs
until
his
thoughts
took
a
very
gloomy
tinge
indeed
to
begin
with
in
spite
of
his
mother
assurance
he
had
no
faith
in
his
own
cause
his
acquaintance
with
carroll
was
but
an
affair
of
months
and
their
actual
meetings
comprised
incredibly
few
days
orde
was
naturally
it
did
not
seem
conceivable
to
him
that
he
could
win
her
without
a
long
courtship
and
superadded
was
the
almost
intolerable
weight
of
ideas
as
to
her
domestic
duties
although
orde
held
exactions
in
very
slight
esteem
and
was
most
sceptical
in
regard
to
the
disasters
that
would
follow
their
thwarting
nevertheless
he
had
to
confess
to
himself
that
all
carroll
training
life
the
very
purity
and
sweetness
of
her
disposition
lent
the
situation
an
iron
reality
for
her
he
became
much
discouraged
nevertheless
at
the
very
moment
when
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
it
would
be
utterly
useless
even
to
indulge
in
hope
for
some
years
to
come
he
spoke
it
came
about
suddenly
and
entirely
without
premeditation
the
two
had
escaped
for
a
breath
of
air
late
in
the
evening
following
the
conventions
they
merely
strolled
to
the
end
of
the
block
and
back
always
within
sight
of
the
house
fifth
avenue
was
gay
with
illumination
and
the
prancing
of
horses
returning
uptown
or
down
to
the
washington
square
district
in
contrast
the
side
street
with
its
austere
rows
of
brownstone
houses
each
with
its
area
and
flight
of
steps
its
spaced
gas
lamps
its
deserted
roadway
seemed
very
still
and
quiet
carroll
was
in
a
tired
and
pensive
mood
she
held
her
head
back
breathing
deeply
only
a
little
strip
but
it
the
stars
said
she
looking
up
to
the
sky
between
the
houses
so
quiet
and
calm
and
she
seemed
to
orde
for
the
first
time
like
a
little
girl
the
maturer
complexities
which
we
put
on
with
years
with
experience
and
with
the
knowledge
of
life
had
for
the
moment
fallen
from
her
leaving
merely
the
simple
soul
of
childhood
gazing
in
its
eternal
wonder
at
the
stars
a
wave
of
tenderness
lifted
orde
from
his
feet
he
leaned
over
his
breath
coming
quickly
he
said
she
looked
up
at
him
and
shrank
back
no
you
must
she
cried
she
did
not
pretend
to
misunderstand
the
preliminaries
seemed
in
some
mysterious
fashion
to
have
been
said
long
ago
life
or
death
with
me
he
said
must
not
she
cried
fluttering
like
a
bird
promised
myself
long
ago
that
i
must
always
always
take
care
of
please
dear
pleaded
orde
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
than
this
just
the
simple
incoherent
symbols
of
pleading
but
in
such
crises
it
is
rather
the
soul
than
the
tongue
that
speaks
his
hand
met
hers
and
closed
about
it
it
did
not
respond
to
his
grasp
nor
did
it
draw
away
but
lay
limp
and
warm
and
helpless
in
his
own
she
shook
her
head
slowly
you
care
for
me
dear
asked
orde
very
gently
have
no
right
to
tell
you
that
answered
she
have
tried
oh
so
hard
to
keep
you
from
saying
this
for
i
knew
i
had
no
right
to
hear
orde
heart
leaped
with
a
wild
exultation
do
care
for
me
he
cried
they
had
mounted
the
steps
and
stood
just
within
the
vestibule
orde
drew
her
toward
him
but
she
repulsed
him
gently
she
shook
her
head
be
very
good
to
me
i
very
cried
orde
me
that
you
love
me
tell
me
that
marry
me
would
kill
mother
if
i
should
leave
her
she
said
sadly
you
must
marry
me
pleaded
orde
are
made
for
each
other
god
meant
us
for
each
would
have
to
be
after
a
great
many
years
she
said
doubtfully
she
pulled
the
bell
which
jangled
faintly
in
the
depths
of
the
house
she
said
to
me
no
you
must
not
come
she
cut
short
orde
insistence
and
the
eloquence
that
had
just
found
its
life
by
slipping
inside
the
door
and
closing
it
after
her
orde
stood
for
a
moment
uncertain
then
turned
away
and
walked
up
the
street
his
eyes
so
blinded
by
the
greater
glory
that
he
all
but
ran
down
an
inoffensive
at
the
hotel
he
wrote
a
long
letter
to
his
mother
the
first
part
was
full
of
the
exultation
of
his
discovery
he
told
of
his
good
fortune
quite
as
something
just
born
utterly
forgetting
his
predictions
before
he
came
east
then
as
the
first
effervescence
died
a
more
gloomy
view
of
the
situation
came
uppermost
to
his
heated
imagination
the
deadlock
seemed
complete
carroll
devotion
to
what
she
considered
her
duty
appeared
unbreakable
in
the
reaction
orde
doubted
whether
he
would
have
it
otherwise
and
then
his
fighting
blood
surged
back
to
his
heart
all
the
eloquence
the
arguments
the
pleadings
he
should
have
commanded
earlier
in
the
evening
hurried
belated
to
their
posts
after
the
manner
of
the
young
and
imaginative
when
in
the
white
fire
of
emotion
he
began
dramatising
scenes
between
carroll
and
himself
he
saw
them
plainly
he
heard
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
as
he
rehearsed
the
arguments
which
should
break
her
resolution
a
duty
to
her
own
soul
her
obligation
toward
the
man
she
could
make
or
mar
by
her
love
her
the
necessity
of
a
break
some
time
the
advantage
of
having
the
crisis
over
with
now
rather
than
later
a
belief
in
the
ultimate
good
even
to
bishop
of
throwing
that
lady
more
on
her
own
resources
and
so
forth
and
so
on
down
a
list
of
arguments
obvious
enough
or
trivial
enough
but
all
inspired
by
the
soul
of
fervour
all
ennobled
by
the
spirit
of
truth
that
lies
back
of
the
major
premise
that
a
woman
should
cleave
to
a
man
forsaking
all
others
orde
sat
back
in
his
chair
his
eyes
vacant
his
pen
all
but
falling
from
his
hand
he
did
not
finish
the
letter
to
his
mother
after
a
while
he
went
upstairs
to
his
own
room
the
fever
of
the
argument
coursed
through
his
veins
all
that
long
night
over
and
over
again
he
rehearsed
it
in
wearisome
repetition
until
it
had
assumed
a
certain
and
almost
invariable
form
and
when
he
had
reached
the
end
of
his
pleading
he
began
it
over
again
until
the
daylight
found
him
weary
and
fevered
he
arose
and
dressed
himself
he
could
eat
no
breakfast
by
a
tremendous
effort
of
the
will
he
restrained
himself
from
going
over
to
ninth
street
until
the
middle
of
the
morning
he
entered
the
to
find
her
seated
at
the
piano
his
heart
bounded
and
for
an
instant
he
stood
still
summoning
his
forces
to
the
struggle
for
which
he
had
so
painfully
gathered
his
ammunition
she
did
not
look
up
as
he
approached
until
he
stood
almost
at
her
shoulder
then
she
turned
to
him
and
held
out
both
her
hands
is
no
use
jack
she
said
care
for
you
too
much
i
will
marry
you
whenever
you
xix
orde
left
that
evening
early
this
was
at
carroll
request
she
preferred
herself
to
inform
her
family
of
the
news
do
know
yet
how
mother
is
going
to
get
along
said
she
back
afternoon
and
see
them
the
next
morning
orde
having
at
last
finished
and
despatched
the
letter
to
his
mother
drifted
up
the
avenue
and
into
the
club
as
he
passed
the
smoking
room
he
caught
sight
of
gerald
seated
in
an
armchair
by
the
window
he
entered
the
room
and
took
a
seat
opposite
the
young
fellow
gerald
held
out
his
hand
silently
which
the
other
took
glad
to
hear
it
said
gerald
at
last
glad
i
told
you
i
was
on
your
he
hesitated
then
went
on
gravely
carroll
is
having
a
hard
time
though
i
think
it
worse
than
she
expected
no
worse
than
i
expected
you
are
to
be
one
of
the
family
so
i
am
going
to
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
it
something
naturally
i
speak
of
otherwise
but
carroll
is
my
only
sister
and
i
want
her
to
be
happy
i
think
you
are
the
man
to
make
her
so
but
i
want
you
to
avoid
one
mistake
fight
it
out
right
now
and
never
give
back
the
ground
you
feel
that
replied
orde
quietly
made
father
resign
from
the
army
and
while
he
a
dear
old
boy
he
never
done
anything
since
she
holds
me
although
i
see
through
her
possibly
because
i
weak
or
indifferent
possibly
because
i
have
a
silly
idea
i
can
make
a
bad
situation
better
by
hanging
around
she
is
rapidly
turning
kendrick
into
a
sullen
little
prig
because
he
believes
implicitly
all
the
grievances
against
the
world
and
the
individual
she
pours
out
to
him
you
see
i
have
no
illusions
concerning
my
family
only
carroll
has
held
to
her
freedom
of
soul
because
that
the
joyous
free
sweet
nature
of
her
bless
her
for
the
first
time
she
pitted
her
will
against
mother
and
it
a
bad
mother
objected
asked
orde
gerald
laughed
a
little
bitterly
was
very
bad
said
he
grown
horns
hoofs
and
a
tail
overnight
there
nothing
too
criminal
to
have
escaped
your
notice
i
have
been
forbidden
to
consort
with
you
so
has
the
general
the
battle
of
last
night
had
to
do
with
your
coming
to
the
house
at
all
as
it
is
not
carroll
house
naturally
she
has
no
right
to
shall
not
be
permitted
to
see
her
cried
orde
did
not
say
that
carroll
announced
then
quite
openly
that
she
would
see
you
outside
i
fancy
that
was
the
crux
of
the
matter
do
you
see
the
whole
affair
shifted
ground
carroll
has
offered
direct
disobedience
oh
she
a
bully
little
fighter
he
finished
in
admiring
accents
ca
quite
realise
what
she
doing
for
your
sake
not
only
fighting
mother
but
her
own
orde
found
a
note
at
the
hotel
asking
him
to
be
in
washington
square
at
two
carroll
met
him
with
a
bright
smile
are
quite
right
at
home
she
said
is
a
great
shock
to
poor
mother
at
first
and
she
feels
very
strongly
oh
it
is
you
dear
it
the
notion
that
i
can
care
for
anybody
but
her
you
see
she
been
used
to
the
other
idea
so
long
that
i
suppose
it
seemed
a
part
of
the
universe
to
her
she
get
used
to
it
after
a
little
but
it
takes
orde
examined
her
face
anxiously
two
bright
red
spots
burned
on
her
cheeks
her
eyes
flashed
with
a
nervous
animation
and
a
faint
shade
had
sketched
itself
beneath
them
had
a
hard
time
he
murmured
poor
dear
she
smiled
up
at
him
have
to
pay
for
the
good
things
in
life
do
we
dear
and
they
are
worth
it
things
will
come
right
after
a
little
we
must
not
be
too
impatient
now
let
enjoy
the
day
the
park
is
so
bad
is
it
at
five
orde
took
her
back
to
her
doorstep
where
he
left
her
this
went
on
for
several
days
at
the
end
of
that
time
orde
could
not
conceal
from
himself
that
the
strain
was
beginning
to
tell
carroll
worried
expression
grew
from
day
to
day
while
the
animation
that
characterised
her
manner
when
freed
from
the
restraint
became
more
and
more
forced
she
was
as
though
dominated
by
some
inner
tensity
which
she
dared
not
relax
even
for
a
moment
to
orde
questionings
she
replied
as
evasively
as
she
could
assuring
him
always
that
matters
were
going
as
well
as
she
had
expected
that
mother
was
very
difficult
that
orde
must
have
patience
for
things
would
surely
come
all
right
she
begged
him
to
remain
quiescent
until
she
gave
him
the
word
and
she
implored
it
so
earnestly
that
orde
though
he
chafed
was
forced
to
await
the
turn
of
events
every
afternoon
she
met
him
from
two
to
five
the
situation
gave
little
opportunity
for
lovers
demonstrations
she
seemed
entirely
absorbed
by
the
inner
stress
of
the
struggle
she
was
going
through
so
that
hardly
did
she
seem
able
to
follow
coherently
even
plans
for
the
future
she
appeared
however
to
gain
a
mysterious
refreshment
from
mere
proximity
so
gradually
he
with
that
streak
of
almost
feminine
intuition
which
is
the
especial
gift
to
lovers
came
to
the
point
of
sitting
quite
silent
with
her
clasping
her
hand
out
of
sight
of
the
chance
when
the
time
came
to
return
they
arose
and
walked
back
to
ninth
street
still
in
silence
at
the
door
they
said
he
kissed
her
quite
soberly
wish
i
could
help
sweetheart
said
he
she
shook
her
head
at
him
do
help
she
replied
from
gerald
at
the
club
orde
sought
more
intimate
news
of
what
was
going
on
for
several
days
however
the
young
man
absented
himself
from
his
usual
haunts
it
was
only
at
the
end
of
the
week
that
orde
succeeded
in
finding
him
gerald
answered
his
greeting
have
been
around
much
been
sticking
pretty
close
little
by
little
orde
eager
questions
drew
out
the
truth
of
the
situation
bishop
had
shut
herself
up
in
a
blind
and
incredible
obstinacy
whence
she
sallied
with
floods
of
complaints
tears
accusations
despairs
reproaches
vows
hysterics
all
the
battery
of
the
woman
misunderstood
but
in
which
she
refused
to
listen
to
a
consecutive
conversation
if
carroll
undertook
to
say
anything
the
third
word
would
start
her
mother
off
into
one
of
her
long
and
hysterical
tirades
it
was
very
wearing
and
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
gained
from
day
to
day
her
child
had
disobeyed
her
and
as
a
climax
she
had
assumed
the
impregnable
position
of
a
complete
prostration
wherein
she
demanded
the
minute
care
of
an
invalid
in
the
crisis
of
a
disorder
she
could
bear
no
faintest
ray
of
illumination
no
lightest
footfall
in
a
hushed
twilight
she
lay
her
eyes
swathed
moaning
feebly
that
her
early
dissolution
at
the
hands
of
ingratitude
was
imminent
thus
she
established
a
deadlock
which
was
likely
to
continue
indefinitely
the
mere
mention
of
the
subject
nearest
carroll
heart
brought
the
feeble
complaint
you
want
to
kill
me
the
only
scrap
of
victory
to
be
snatched
from
this
stricken
field
was
the
fact
that
carroll
insisted
on
going
to
meet
her
lover
every
afternoon
the
invalid
demanded
every
moment
of
her
time
either
for
personal
attendance
or
in
fulfilment
of
numerous
and
exacting
church
duties
an
attempt
however
to
encroach
thus
on
the
afternoon
hours
met
a
stone
wall
of
resolution
on
carroll
part
this
was
the
situation
orde
gathered
from
his
talk
with
gerald
though
he
fretted
under
the
tyranny
exacted
he
could
see
nothing
which
could
relieve
the
situation
save
his
own
withdrawal
he
had
already
long
his
visit
important
affairs
connected
with
his
work
demanded
his
attention
he
had
the
comfort
of
carroll
love
assured
and
the
lapse
of
time
alone
could
be
depended
on
to
change
attitude
a
consummation
on
which
carroll
seemed
set
although
orde
felt
all
the
lively
dissatisfaction
natural
to
a
newly
accepted
lover
who
had
gained
slight
opportunity
for
favours
for
confidences
even
for
the
making
of
plans
nevertheless
he
could
see
for
the
present
nothing
else
to
do
the
morning
after
he
had
reached
this
conclusion
he
again
met
gerald
at
the
gymnasium
that
young
man
while
as
imperturbable
and
languid
in
movement
as
ever
concealed
an
excitement
he
explained
nothing
until
the
two
after
a
shower
and
were
clothing
themselves
leisurely
in
the
empty
said
gerald
suddenly
worried
about
orde
straightened
his
back
and
looked
steadily
at
gerald
but
said
nothing
has
commenced
bothering
her
again
it
was
so
bad
as
long
as
she
stuck
to
daytime
but
now
she
taken
to
prowling
in
a
dozen
times
a
night
i
hear
their
voices
for
an
hour
or
so
at
a
time
i
afraid
beginning
to
wear
on
carroll
more
than
you
you
said
orde
briefly
that
afternoon
with
carroll
he
took
the
affair
firmly
in
hand
thing
has
come
to
the
point
where
it
must
stop
said
he
i
going
to
stop
it
i
have
some
rights
in
the
matter
of
the
health
and
comfort
of
the
girl
i
do
you
intend
to
do
asked
carroll
frightened
shall
have
it
out
with
your
mother
replied
orde
must
do
that
implored
carroll
would
do
absolutely
no
good
and
would
just
result
in
a
quarrel
that
could
never
be
patched
do
know
as
i
care
particularly
said
orde
i
do
think
she
is
my
orde
stirred
uneasily
with
a
mental
reservation
as
to
selfishness
but
said
nothing
think
what
it
means
to
a
girl
to
be
married
and
go
away
from
home
finally
without
her
parent
consent
it
the
most
beautiful
and
sacred
thing
in
her
life
and
she
wants
it
to
be
perfect
it
worth
waiting
and
fighting
a
little
for
after
all
we
are
both
young
and
we
have
known
each
other
such
a
very
short
so
she
pleaded
with
him
bringing
forward
all
the
unanswerable
arguments
built
by
the
long
average
experience
of
the
world
arguments
which
orde
could
not
refute
but
whose
falsity
to
the
situation
he
felt
most
keenly
he
could
not
specify
without
betraying
gerald
confidence
raging
inwardly
he
consented
to
a
further
armistice
at
his
hotel
he
found
a
telegram
he
did
not
open
it
until
he
had
reached
his
own
room
it
was
from
home
urging
his
immediate
return
for
the
acceptance
of
some
contracted
work
hell
with
the
contracted
work
he
muttered
savagely
and
calling
a
sent
an
answer
very
much
to
that
effect
then
he
plunged
his
hands
into
his
pockets
stretched
out
his
legs
and
fell
into
a
deep
and
gloomy
meditation
he
was
interrupted
by
a
knock
on
the
door
in
he
called
without
turning
his
head
he
heard
the
door
open
and
shut
after
a
moment
he
looked
around
kendrick
bishop
stood
watching
him
orde
lit
the
gas
kendrick
said
he
the
boy
made
no
reply
orde
looked
at
him
curiously
and
saw
that
he
was
suffering
from
an
intense
excitement
his
frame
trembled
convulsively
his
lips
were
white
his
face
went
red
and
pale
by
turns
evidently
he
had
something
to
say
but
could
not
yet
trust
his
voice
orde
sat
down
and
waited
got
to
let
my
mother
alone
he
managed
to
say
finally
have
done
nothing
to
your
mother
kendrick
said
orde
kindly
brought
her
to
the
point
of
death
asserted
keudrick
violently
hounding
her
to
her
grave
you
turning
those
she
loves
best
against
orde
thought
to
catch
the
echo
of
quotation
in
these
words
your
mother
send
you
to
me
he
asked
we
had
any
one
else
worth
the
name
of
man
in
the
family
i
have
to
come
said
kendrick
almost
in
the
manner
of
one
repeating
a
lesson
do
you
want
me
to
do
asked
orde
after
a
moment
of
thought
away
cried
kendrick
this
unmanly
contest
against
a
defenceless
can
not
do
that
replied
orde
quietly
kendrick
face
assumed
a
livid
pallor
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
turn
black
with
excitement
trembling
in
every
limb
but
without
hesitation
he
advanced
on
orde
drew
a
short
from
beneath
his
coat
and
slashed
the
young
man
across
the
face
orde
made
an
involuntary
movement
to
arise
but
sank
back
and
looked
steadily
at
the
boy
once
again
kendrick
hit
raised
his
arm
for
the
third
time
hesitated
his
lips
writhed
and
then
with
a
sob
he
cast
the
little
whip
from
him
and
burst
from
the
room
orde
sat
without
moving
while
two
red
lines
slowly
defined
themselves
across
his
face
the
theatrical
quality
of
the
scene
and
the
turgid
rhetorical
bathos
of
the
boy
speeches
attested
his
youth
and
the
unformed
violence
of
his
emotions
did
they
also
indicate
a
rehearsal
or
had
the
boy
merely
been
goaded
to
vague
action
by
implicit
belief
in
a
woman
vagaries
orde
did
not
know
but
the
incident
brought
home
to
him
as
nothing
else
could
the
turmoil
of
that
household
youngster
he
concluded
his
reverie
and
went
to
wash
his
face
in
hot
water
he
had
left
carroll
that
afternoon
in
a
comparatively
philosophical
and
hopeful
frame
of
mind
the
next
day
she
came
to
him
with
hurried
nervous
steps
her
usually
pale
cheeks
mounting
danger
signals
of
flaming
red
her
eyes
swimming
when
she
greeted
him
she
choked
and
two
of
the
tears
overflowed
quite
unmindful
of
the
nursemaids
across
the
square
orde
put
his
arm
comfortingly
about
her
shoulder
she
hid
her
face
against
his
sleeve
and
began
softly
to
cry
orde
did
not
attempt
as
yet
to
draw
from
her
the
cause
of
this
unusual
agitation
a
park
bench
stood
between
two
dense
bushes
screened
from
all
directions
save
one
to
this
he
led
her
he
comforted
her
as
one
comforts
a
child
stroking
clumsily
her
hair
murmuring
trivialities
without
meaning
letting
her
emotion
relieve
itself
after
awhile
she
recovered
somewhat
her
control
of
herself
and
sat
up
away
from
him
dabbing
at
her
eyes
with
a
handkerchief
dampened
into
a
tiny
wad
but
even
after
she
had
shaken
her
head
vigorously
at
last
and
smiled
up
at
him
rather
tremulously
in
token
that
the
storm
was
over
she
would
not
tell
him
that
anything
definite
had
happened
to
bring
on
the
outburst
just
needed
you
she
said
all
it
just
nothing
but
being
a
woman
i
think
you
get
used
to
little
things
like
thing
has
got
to
quit
said
he
grimly
she
said
nothing
but
reached
up
shyly
and
touched
his
face
where
kendrick
whip
had
stung
and
her
eyes
became
very
tender
a
carriage
rolled
around
washington
arch
and
coming
to
a
stand
discharged
its
single
passenger
on
the
pavement
it
gerald
cried
carroll
surprised
the
young
man
catching
sight
of
them
picked
his
way
daintily
and
leisurely
toward
them
he
was
as
usual
dressed
with
meticulous
nicety
the
carnation
in
his
the
gloss
on
his
hat
and
shoes
the
freshness
on
his
gloves
the
correct
angle
on
his
stick
his
dark
long
face
with
its
romantic
moustache
and
its
almost
effeminate
soft
eyes
was
as
unemotional
and
wearied
as
ever
as
he
approached
he
raised
his
stick
slightly
by
way
of
salutation
have
brought
said
he
carriage
and
i
wish
you
would
both
do
me
the
favour
to
accompany
me
on
a
short
taking
their
consent
for
granted
he
signalled
the
vehicle
which
rapidly
approached
the
three
carroll
and
orde
somewhat
bewildered
took
their
seats
during
a
brief
drive
gerald
made
conversation
on
different
topics
apparently
quite
indifferent
as
to
whether
or
not
his
companions
replied
after
an
interval
the
carriage
drew
up
opposite
a
dwelling
on
a
side
street
gerald
rang
the
bell
and
a
moment
later
the
three
were
ushered
by
a
discreet
and
elderly
maid
into
a
little
square
immediately
off
the
hall
the
maid
withdrew
gerald
carefully
deposited
his
top
hat
on
the
floor
placed
in
it
his
gloves
and
leaned
his
stick
against
its
brim
have
brought
you
here
among
other
purposes
to
hear
from
me
a
little
brief
wisdom
drawn
from
experience
and
the
observation
of
life
he
began
addressing
his
expectant
and
curious
guests
wisdom
is
briefly
this
there
comes
a
time
in
the
affairs
of
every
household
when
a
man
must
assert
himself
as
the
ruler
in
all
the
details
he
may
depend
on
the
woman
judgment
experience
and
knowledge
but
when
it
comes
to
the
big
crises
where
life
is
deflected
into
one
channel
or
the
other
then
unless
the
man
does
the
deciding
he
is
lost
for
ever
and
his
happiness
and
the
happiness
of
those
who
depend
on
him
this
is
abstruse
but
i
come
to
the
particular
application
shortly
moments
of
decision
are
always
clouded
by
many
considerations
the
decision
is
sure
to
cut
across
much
that
is
expedient
much
that
seems
to
be
necessary
much
that
is
dear
carroll
remembers
the
case
of
our
own
father
the
general
would
have
made
a
name
for
himself
in
the
army
his
wife
demanded
his
retirement
he
retired
and
his
career
ended
that
was
the
moment
of
his
decision
it
is
very
easy
to
say
in
view
of
that
simple
statement
that
the
general
was
weak
in
yielding
to
his
wife
but
a
consideration
of
the
circumstances
do
you
say
all
this
interrupted
orde
gerald
raised
his
hand
me
it
is
necessary
as
you
will
agree
when
you
have
heard
me
through
bishop
was
in
poor
health
the
general
in
poor
financial
circumstances
the
doctors
said
the
riviera
bishop
parents
who
were
wealthy
furnished
the
money
for
her
sojourn
in
that
climate
she
could
not
bear
to
be
separated
from
her
husband
a
refusal
to
resign
then
a
refusal
to
accept
the
financial
aid
offered
would
have
been
cast
against
him
as
a
reproach
he
did
not
love
his
wife
enough
to
sacrifice
his
pride
his
ambition
his
nevertheless
that
was
his
moment
of
decision
could
multiply
instances
yet
it
would
only
accumulate
needless
proof
my
point
is
that
in
these
great
moments
a
man
can
afford
to
take
into
consideration
only
the
affair
itself
never
must
he
think
of
anything
but
the
simple
elements
of
the
problem
he
must
ignore
whose
toes
are
trodden
upon
whose
feelings
are
hurt
whose
happiness
is
apparently
marred
for
note
this
if
a
man
does
fearlessly
the
right
thing
i
am
convinced
that
in
the
readjustment
all
these
conflicting
interests
find
themselves
bettered
instead
of
injured
you
want
a
concrete
instance
i
believe
firmly
that
if
the
general
had
kept
to
his
army
life
and
made
his
wife
conform
to
it
after
the
storm
had
passed
she
would
have
settled
down
to
a
happy
existence
i
can
not
prove
it
i
believe
may
be
all
very
true
gerald
said
orde
i
fail
to
see
why
you
have
brought
us
to
this
strange
house
to
tell
a
moment
replied
gerald
patience
believing
that
thoroughly
i
have
come
in
the
last
hours
to
a
decision
that
this
happens
not
to
affect
my
own
immediate
fortunes
does
not
seem
to
me
to
invalidate
my
he
carefully
unbuttoned
his
frock
coat
crossed
his
legs
produced
a
paper
and
a
package
from
his
inside
pocket
and
eyed
the
two
before
him
have
here
he
went
on
suddenly
papers
duly
made
out
in
this
package
is
a
plain
gold
ring
in
the
next
room
is
waiting
by
prearrangement
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
in
the
clergy
personally
i
am
at
your
he
looked
at
them
expectantly
very
thing
no
cried
orde
and
carroll
in
unison
nevertheless
in
spite
of
this
divergence
of
opinion
ten
minutes
later
the
three
passed
through
the
door
into
the
back
apartment
carroll
still
hesitant
orde
in
triumph
gerald
as
correct
and
unemotional
as
ever
in
this
back
room
they
found
waiting
a
young
clergyman
conversing
easily
with
two
young
girls
at
the
sight
of
carroll
these
latter
rushed
forward
and
overwhelmed
her
with
endearments
carroll
broke
into
a
quickly
suppressed
sob
and
clasped
them
close
to
her
you
dears
she
cried
so
glad
you
here
she
flashed
a
grateful
look
in
gerald
direction
and
a
moment
later
took
occasion
to
press
his
arm
and
whisper
thought
of
everything
you
the
dearest
brother
in
the
world
gerald
received
this
calmly
and
set
about
organising
the
ceremony
in
fifteen
minutes
the
little
party
separated
at
the
front
door
amid
a
chatter
of
congratulations
and
good
wishes
and
orde
entered
the
cab
and
drove
away
xx
it
is
the
best
way
dear
after
all
cried
carroll
pressing
close
to
her
husband
few
minutes
ago
i
was
all
doubts
and
fears
but
now
i
feel
so
safe
and
settled
she
laughed
happily
is
as
though
i
had
belonged
to
you
always
you
old
rock
of
gibraltar
and
anything
that
happens
now
will
come
from
the
outside
and
not
from
the
inside
it
dear
sweetheart
said
orde
mother
i
wonder
how
she
take
soon
know
anyway
replied
orde
a
little
grimly
in
the
hallway
of
the
bishop
house
orde
kissed
her
brave
sweetheart
said
he
remember
that
now
you
my
she
nodded
at
him
gravely
and
disappeared
orde
sat
in
the
dim
parlour
for
what
seemed
to
be
an
interminable
period
occasionally
the
sounds
of
distant
voices
rose
to
his
ear
and
died
away
again
the
front
door
opened
to
admit
some
one
but
orde
could
not
see
who
it
was
twice
a
scurrying
of
feet
overhead
seemed
to
indicate
the
bustle
of
excitement
the
afternoon
waned
a
faint
whiff
of
cooking
escaping
through
some
carelessly
open
door
was
borne
to
his
nostrils
it
grew
dark
but
the
lamps
remained
unlighted
finally
he
heard
the
rustle
of
the
portieres
and
turned
to
see
the
dim
form
of
the
general
standing
there
business
bad
business
muttered
the
old
man
very
hard
on
me
perhaps
you
did
the
right
thing
you
must
be
good
to
her
but
i
can
not
countenance
this
affair
it
was
most
sir
the
portieres
fell
again
and
he
disappeared
finally
after
another
interval
carroll
returned
she
went
immediately
to
the
which
she
lit
orde
then
saw
that
she
was
sobbing
violently
she
came
to
him
and
for
a
moment
hid
her
face
against
his
breast
he
patted
her
hair
waiting
for
her
to
speak
after
a
little
she
controlled
herself
was
it
asked
orde
then
she
shivered
never
knew
people
could
be
so
cruel
she
complained
in
almost
a
bewildered
manner
we
must
go
she
she
has
ordered
me
out
of
the
house
and
says
she
never
wants
to
see
my
face
she
broke
down
for
a
second
jack
she
ca
mean
that
i
always
been
a
good
daughter
to
her
and
she
very
bitter
against
gerald
oh
i
told
her
it
was
his
fault
but
she
wo
listen
she
sent
for
that
odious
merritt
her
rector
you
know
and
he
supported
her
i
believe
he
angry
because
we
did
not
go
to
him
could
you
believe
such
a
thing
and
she
shut
herself
up
in
her
air
of
high
virtue
and
underneath
it
she
oh
so
angry
it
natural
she
should
be
upset
comforted
orde
think
too
much
of
what
she
does
now
later
she
get
over
carroll
shivered
again
do
know
dear
and
i
not
going
to
tell
you
why
she
cried
told
me
that
you
and
i
were
in
a
conspiracy
to
drive
her
to
her
grave
so
we
could
get
her
money
must
be
a
little
crazy
said
orde
still
pacifically
help
me
said
carroll
must
get
my
you
just
pack
a
bag
and
leave
the
rest
until
tomorrow
it
about
hungry
says
i
must
take
every
stitch
belonging
to
me
they
packed
trunks
until
late
that
night
quite
alone
gerald
had
departed
promptly
after
breaking
the
news
probably
without
realising
to
what
a
pass
affairs
would
come
a
frightened
servant
evidently
in
disobedience
of
orders
and
in
fear
of
destruction
brought
them
a
tray
of
food
which
she
put
down
on
a
small
table
and
hastily
fled
in
a
room
down
the
hall
they
could
hear
the
murmur
of
voices
where
bishop
received
spiritual
consolation
from
her
adviser
when
the
trunks
were
packed
orde
sent
for
a
baggage
waggon
carroll
went
silently
from
place
to
place
saying
farewell
to
such
of
her
treasures
as
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
leave
orde
scribbled
a
note
to
gerald
requesting
him
to
pack
up
the
miscellanies
and
send
them
to
michigan
by
freight
the
baggage
man
and
orde
carried
the
trunks
downstairs
no
one
appeared
carroll
and
orde
walked
together
to
the
hotel
next
morning
an
interview
with
gerald
confirmed
them
in
their
resolution
of
immediate
departure
is
set
in
her
opposition
now
and
at
present
she
believes
firmly
that
her
influence
will
separate
you
such
a
state
of
mind
can
not
be
changed
in
an
you
asked
carroll
i
he
shrugged
go
on
as
usual
i
have
my
wish
you
would
come
out
in
our
part
of
the
country
ventured
orde
gerald
smiled
his
fine
smile
said
he
to
a
train
is
useless
and
a
bore
to
carroll
threw
herself
on
his
neck
in
an
access
of
passionate
weeping
will
write
and
tell
me
of
everything
wo
you
she
begged
course
there
now
orde
followed
him
into
the
hall
would
be
quite
useless
to
attempt
another
interview
he
inquired
gerald
made
a
little
mouth
am
in
the
same
predicament
as
yourselves
said
he
have
since
nine
this
morning
taken
up
my
quarters
at
the
club
please
do
not
tell
carroll
it
would
only
pain
at
the
station
just
before
they
passed
in
to
the
train
the
general
appeared
there
he
fussed
your
mother
should
hear
of
my
being
here
it
would
be
a
very
bad
business
very
bad
this
is
very
sad
but
well
dear
and
you
sir
be
good
to
her
and
write
your
daddy
carroll
he
be
lonesome
for
he
blew
his
nose
very
loudly
and
wiped
his
glasses
run
along
run
along
he
hurried
them
us
not
have
any
scenes
here
my
dear
open
this
envelope
when
you
are
well
started
it
may
help
cheer
the
journey
not
a
word
he
hurried
them
through
the
gate
paying
no
heed
to
what
they
were
trying
to
say
then
he
steamed
away
and
bustled
into
a
cab
without
once
looking
back
when
the
train
had
passed
the
harlem
river
and
was
swaying
its
uneven
way
across
the
open
country
carroll
opened
the
envelope
it
contained
a
check
for
a
thousand
dollars
old
daddy
she
murmured
only
wedding
present
are
the
capitalist
of
the
family
said
orde
do
know
how
poor
a
man
you
married
i
have
much
more
than
the
proverbial
silver
watch
and
bad
she
reached
out
to
press
his
hand
in
reassurance
he
compared
it
humorously
with
his
own
a
homely
knotted
tanned
old
thing
it
is
by
yours
said
he
a
strong
hand
she
replied
soberly
a
dear
suddenly
she
snatched
it
up
and
pressed
it
for
a
fleeting
instant
against
her
cheek
looking
at
him
half
ashamed
xxi
the
winter
months
were
spent
at
monrovia
where
orde
and
his
wife
lived
for
a
time
at
the
hotel
this
was
somewhat
expensive
but
orde
was
not
quite
ready
to
decide
on
a
home
and
he
developed
unexpected
opposition
to
living
at
redding
in
the
orde
homestead
i
been
thinking
about
it
he
told
grandma
orde
young
couple
should
start
out
on
their
own
responsibility
i
know
you
be
glad
to
have
us
but
i
think
it
better
the
other
way
besides
i
must
be
at
monrovia
a
good
deal
of
the
time
and
i
want
carroll
with
me
she
can
make
you
a
good
long
visit
in
the
spring
when
i
have
to
go
up
to
this
grandma
orde
being
a
wise
old
lady
had
to
nod
her
assent
although
she
would
much
have
liked
her
son
near
her
at
monrovia
then
they
took
up
their
quarters
carroll
soon
became
acquainted
with
the
life
of
the
place
monrovia
like
most
towns
of
its
sort
and
size
consisted
of
an
upper
stratum
of
mill
owners
and
lumber
operators
possessed
of
considerable
wealth
some
cultivation
and
definite
social
ideas
a
gawky
countrified
middle
estate
of
storekeepers
catering
both
to
the
farm
and
local
trade
and
the
lumber
mill
operatives
generally
of
holland
extraction
who
dwelt
in
simple
unpainted
board
shanties
the
class
first
mentioned
comprised
a
small
coterie
among
whom
carroll
soon
found
two
or
three
congenials
edith
fuller
wife
of
the
young
cashier
in
the
bank
valerie
cathcart
whose
husband
had
been
killed
in
the
civil
war
clara
taylor
wife
of
the
leading
young
lawyer
of
the
village
and
strangely
enough
mina
heinzman
the
daughter
of
old
heinzman
the
lumberman
nothing
was
more
indicative
of
the
absolute
divorce
of
business
and
social
life
than
the
unbroken
evenness
of
carroll
friendship
for
the
younger
girl
though
later
the
old
german
and
orde
locked
in
serious
struggle
on
the
river
they
continued
to
meet
socially
quite
as
usual
and
the
daughter
of
one
and
the
wife
of
the
other
never
suspected
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
this
impersonality
of
struggle
has
always
been
characteristic
of
the
pioneer
business
man
newmark
received
the
news
of
his
partner
sudden
marriage
without
evincing
any
surprise
but
with
a
sardonic
gleam
in
one
corner
of
his
eye
he
called
promptly
conversed
politely
for
a
half
hour
and
then
took
his
leave
do
you
like
him
asked
orde
when
he
had
gone
looks
like
a
very
shrewd
man
replied
carroll
picking
her
words
for
fear
of
saying
the
wrong
thing
orde
laughed
do
like
him
he
stated
do
dislike
him
said
carroll
not
a
thing
against
him
but
we
could
never
be
in
the
slightest
degree
sympathetic
he
and
i
do
do
jibe
orde
finished
for
her
did
much
think
you
would
joe
never
was
much
of
a
society
it
was
on
the
tip
of
tongue
to
reply
that
were
not
the
only
sort
she
could
appreciate
but
she
refrained
she
had
begun
to
realise
the
extent
of
her
influence
over
her
husband
opinion
newmark
did
not
live
at
the
hotel
early
in
the
fall
he
had
rented
a
small
house
situated
just
off
main
street
set
well
back
from
the
sidewalk
among
clumps
of
oleanders
into
this
he
retired
as
a
snail
into
its
shell
at
first
he
took
his
meals
at
the
hotel
but
later
he
imported
an
impassive
secretive
who
took
charge
of
him
completely
neither
master
nor
man
made
any
friends
and
in
fact
rebuffed
all
advances
one
sunday
carroll
and
orde
out
for
a
walk
passed
this
quaint
little
place
with
its
picket
fence
go
in
and
return
joe
call
suggested
orde
their
knock
at
the
door
brought
the
calm
valet
newmark

sir
said
he
sir
i
tell
him
that

they
turned
away
as
they
sauntered
down
the
little
walk
carroll
suddenly
pressed
close
to
her
husband
arm
she
begged
want
a
little
house
like
that
for
our
very
ca
afford
it
to
own
she
explained
to
rent
it
will
be

girl
cried
carroll
indignantly
us
two
could
do
the
housework
and
the
cooking
said
orde
never
done
such
a
thing
in
your
life
and
i
wo
have
my
little
girl
wo
be
slaving
it
will
be
fun
just
like
protested
carroll
i
got
to
learn
some
time
i
was
brought
up
most
absurdly
and
i
realise
it
see
said
orde
vaguely
the
subject
was
dropped
for
the
time
being
later
carroll
brought
it
up
again
she
was
armed
with
several
sheets
of
hotel
stationery
covered
with
figures
showing
how
much
cheaper
it
would
be
to
keep
house
than
to
board
certainly
make
out
a
strong
case
on
paper
laughed
orde
you
buy
a
rooster
and
a
hen
and
she
raises
two
broods
at
the
end
of
a
year
you
have
and
if
they
all
breed
even
allowing
half
roosters
you
have
over
three
hundred
and
if
they
all
breed
have
about
hundred
and
if
stop
cried
carroll
covering
her
ears
right
agreed
orde
equably
that
the
way
it
figures
funny
the
earth
is
overrun
with
chickens
is
it
she
thrust
her
tables
of
figures
into
her
desk
drawer
just
making
fun
of
me
always
she
said
reproachfully
two
days
later
orde
took
her
one
block
up
the
street
to
look
at
a
tiny
little
house
tucked
on
a
lot
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
church
mighty
little
said
he
have
to
go
out
in
the
hall
to
change
my
collar
and
we
could
have
more
than
two
people
at
a
time
to
call
on
a
dear
said
she
i
not
so
myself
whatever
you
may
they
ended
by
renting
the
little
house
and
carroll
took
charge
of
it
delightedly
what
difficulties
she
overcame
and
what
laughable
and
cryable
mistakes
she
made
only
those
who
have
encountered
a
like
situation
could
realise
she
learned
fast
however
and
took
a
real
pride
in
her
tiny
box
of
a
home
a
piano
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
but
the
great
golden
harp
occupied
one
corner
or
rather
one
side
of
the
parlour
standing
thus
enshrouded
in
its
covering
it
rather
resembled
an
august
and
tremendous
veiled
deity
to
great
delight
orde
used
solemnly
to
go
down
on
all
fours
and
knock
his
forehead
thrice
on
the
floor
before
it
when
he
entered
the
house
at
evening
when
the
very
cold
weather
came
and
they
had
to
light
the
stove
which
orde
stoutly
maintained
occupied
all
the
other
half
of
the
parlour
the
harp
delicate
constitution
necessitated
its
standing
in
the
hall
nevertheless
carroll
had
great
comfort
from
it
while
orde
was
away
at
the
office
she
whispered
through
its
mellow
strings
her
great
happiness
the
dreams
for
her
young
motherhood
which
would
come
in
the
summer
the
vague
and
lingering
pain
over
the
hapless
but
beloved
ones
she
had
left
behind
her
in
her
other
life
then
she
arose
refreshed
and
went
about
the
simple
duties
of
her
tiny
domain
the
winter
was
severe
all
the
world
was
white
the
piles
of
snow
along
the
sidewalks
grew
until
carroll
could
hardly
look
over
them
great
fierce
winds
swept
in
from
the
lake
sometimes
orde
and
his
wife
drove
two
miles
to
the
top
of
the
sand
hills
where
first
they
had
met
in
this
their
present
home
and
looked
out
beyond
the
tumbled
shore
ice
to
the
angry
waters
the
wind
pricked
their
faces
and
going
home
the
jingled
the
snowballs
from
the
horses
hoofs
hit
against
the
dash
the
cold
air
seared
the
inside
of
their
nostrils
when
orde
helped
carroll
from
beneath
the
warm
buffalo
robes
she
held
up
to
him
a
face
glowing
with
colour
framed
in
the
soft
fluffy
fur
of
a
hood
darling
he
cried
and
stooped
to
kiss
her
smooth
cold
cheek
when
he
had
returned
from
the
stable
around
the
corner
he
found
the
lit
lamp
throwing
its
modified
light
and
shade
over
the
little
round
table
he
shook
down
the
vigorously
thrust
several
billets
of
wood
in
its
door
and
turned
to
meet
her
eyes
across
the
table
of
fun
being
married
is
it
said
he
of
she
admitted
nodding
gravely
the
business
of
the
firm
was
by
now
about
in
shape
all
the
boom
arrangements
had
been
made
the
two
tugs
were
in
the
water
and
their
machinery
installed
supplies
and
equipments
were
stored
away
the
foremen
of
the
crews
engaged
and
the
crews
themselves
pretty
well
picked
out
only
there
needed
to
build
the
wanigan
and
to
cart
in
the
supplies
for
the
upper
river
works
before
the
spring
and
the
almost
complete
disappearance
of
the
roads
therefore
orde
had
the
good
fortune
of
unusual
leisure
to
enjoy
these
first
months
with
his
bride
they
entered
together
the
unexplored
country
and
found
it
more
wonderful
than
they
had
dreamed
almost
before
they
knew
it
january
and
february
had
flown
must
pack
up
sweetheart
said
orde
only
yesterday
that
we
came
she
cried
regretfully
they
took
the
train
for
redding
were
installed
in
the
gable
room
explored
together
for
three
days
the
delights
of
the
house
the
spicy
joys
of
grandma
orde
and
amanda
cookery
the
almost
adoring
adulation
of
the
old
folks
then
orde
packed
his
assumed
his
woods
clothes
and
marched
off
down
the
street
carrying
his
bag
on
his
back
looks
like
an
old
tramp
in
that
rig
said
grandma
orde
closing
the
storm
door
looks
like
a
conqueror
of
wildernesses
cried
carroll
straining
her
eyes
after
his
vanishing
figure
suddenly
she
darted
after
him
calling
in
her
high
tones
he
turned
and
came
back
to
her
she
clasped
him
by
the
shoulders
reluctant
to
let
him
go
she
said
at
last
take
better
care
of
my
sweetheart
than
you
ever
did
of
jack
orde
wo
you
dear
xxii
orde
had
reconnoitred
the
river
as
a
general
reconnoitres
his
antagonist
and
had
made
his
dispositions
as
the
general
disposes
of
his
army
his
commissary
his
reserves
at
this
point
five
men
could
keep
the
river
clear
at
that
rapid
it
would
require
twenty
there
a
dozen
would
suffice
for
ordinary
contingencies
and
yet
an
emergency
might
call
for
thirty
those
thirty
must
not
be
beyond
reach
in
his
eye
he
apportioned
the
sections
of
the
upper
river
among
the
remoter
wildernesses
every
section
must
have
its
driving
camp
the
crews
of
each
whether
few
or
many
would
be
expected
to
keep
clear
and
running
their
own
on
the
river
as
far
as
the
rear
crew
should
overtake
these
divisions
either
it
would
absorb
them
or
the
members
of
them
would
be
thrown
forward
beyond
the
lowermost
beat
to
take
charge
of
a
new
division
down
stream
when
the
settled
farm
country
or
the
little
towns
were
reached
many
of
the
driving
camps
would
become
unnecessary
the
men
could
be
boarded
out
at
farms
lying
in
their
beats
a
continual
advance
would
progress
toward
the
lake
the
drive
crews
passing
and
repassing
each
other
like
pigeons
in
the
sown
fields
each
of
these
sections
would
be
in
charge
of
a
foreman
whose
responsibility
ceased
with
the
delivery
of
the
logs
to
the
men
next
below
a
walking
boss
would
trudge
continually
the
river
trail
or
ride
the
logs
down
stream
holding
the
correlation
of
these
many
units
orde
himself
would
drive
up
and
down
the
river
overseeing
the
whole
plan
of
campaign
throwing
the
camps
forward
concentrating
his
forces
here
spreading
them
elsewhere
keeping
accurately
in
mind
the
entire
situation
so
that
he
could
say
with
full
confidence
dam
number
one
for
three
hours
at
nine
dam
number
two
for
two
hours
and
a
half
at
ten
thirty
and
so
on
down
the
line
sure
that
the
flood
waters
thus
released
would
arrive
at
the
right
moment
would
supplement
each
other
and
would
so
space
themselves
as
to
accomplish
the
most
work
with
the
least
waste
in
that
one
point
more
than
in
any
other
showed
the
expert
the
water
was
his
ammunition
a
definite
and
limited
quantity
of
it
to
the
logs
out
with
the
was
the
last
word
of
praise
to
be
said
for
the
river
driver
the
more
logs
the
greater
the
glory
thus
it
can
readily
be
seen
this
matter
was
rather
a
campaign
than
a
mere
labour
requiring
the
men
the
munitions
the
organisation
the
tactical
ability
the
strategy
the
resourcefulness
the
boldness
and
the
executive
genius
of
a
military
commander
to
all
these
things
and
to
the
distribution
of
supplies
and
implements
among
the
various
camps
orde
had
attended
the
wanigan
for
the
rear
crew
was
built
the
foremen
and
walking
boss
had
been
picked
out
everything
was
in
readiness
orde
was
satisfied
with
the
situation
except
that
he
found
himself
rather
he
had
counted
on
three
hundred
men
for
his
crews
but
scrape
and
scratch
as
he
would
he
was
unable
to
gather
over
two
hundred
and
fifty
this
matter
was
not
so
serious
however
as
later
when
the
woods
camps
should
break
up
he
would
be
able
to
pick
up
more
workmen
wo
be
rivermen
like
my
old
crew
though
said
orde
regretfully
to
tom
north
the
walking
boss
like
to
steal
a
few
from
some
of
those
muskegon
until
the
logs
should
be
well
adrift
orde
had
resolved
to
boss
the
rear
crew
himself
as
the
rear
was
naturally
the
farthest
up
stream
orde
had
taken
also
the
contract
to
break
the
rollways
belonging
to
carlin
which
in
the
season
work
would
be
piled
up
on
the
bank
thus
he
could
get
to
work
immediately
at
the
and
without
waiting
for
some
one
else
the
seven
or
eight
million
feet
of
lumber
comprised
in
carlin
drive
would
keep
the
men
below
busy
until
the
other
owners
farther
down
and
up
the
tributaries
should
also
have
put
their
season
cut
afloat
the
ice
went
out
early
to
orde
satisfaction
as
soon
as
the
river
ran
clear
in
its
lower
reaches
he
took
his
rear
crew
in
to
rollways
this
crew
was
forty
in
number
and
had
been
picked
from
the
best
a
tough
band
of
veterans
weather
beaten
scarred
in
numerous
fights
or
by
the
backwoods
scourge
of
compact
muscular
fearless
loyal
cynically
aloof
from
those
not
of
their
cult
and
free
to
criticise
in
short
men
to
do
great
things
under
the
strong
leader
and
to
mutiny
at
the
end
of
three
days
under
the
weak
they
piled
off
the
train
at
sawyer
stamped
their
feet
on
the
board
platform
of
the
station
shouldered
their
and
straggled
off
down
the
it
was
an
walk
in
the
ground
had
loosened
its
frost
the
footing
was
in
mud
and
next
morning
bright
and
early
the
breaking
of
the
rollways
began
during
the
winter
the
logs
had
been
hauled
down
ice
roads
to
the
river
where
they
were
in
piles
twenty
and
even
thirty
feet
in
height
the
bed
of
the
stream
itself
was
filled
with
them
for
a
mile
save
in
a
narrow
channel
left
down
through
the
middle
to
allow
for
some
flow
of
water
the
banks
were
piled
with
them
side
on
ready
to
roll
down
at
the
urging
of
the
men
first
of
all
the
entire
crew
set
itself
by
means
of
its
peavies
to
rolling
the
lower
logs
into
the
current
where
they
were
rapidly
borne
away
as
the
waters
were
now
at
flood
this
was
a
quick
and
easy
labour
occasionally
some
tiers
would
be
stuck
together
by
ice
in
which
case
considerable
prying
and
heaving
was
necessary
in
order
to
crack
them
apart
but
forty
men
all
busily
at
work
soon
had
the
river
full
orde
detailed
some
six
or
eight
to
drop
below
in
order
that
the
river
might
run
clear
to
the
next
section
where
the
next
crew
would
take
up
the
task
these
men
quite
simply
walked
to
the
edges
of
the
rollway
rolled
a
log
apiece
into
the
water
stepped
aboard
leaned
against
their
peavies
and
were
swept
away
by
the
swift
current
the
logs
on
which
they
stood
whirled
in
the
eddies
caromed
against
other
timbers
slackened
speed
shot
away
never
did
the
riders
alter
their
poses
of
easy
equilibrium
from
time
to
time
one
propelled
his
craft
ashore
by
hooking
to
and
pushing
against
other
logs
there
he
stood
on
some
prominent
point
leaning
his
chin
contemplatively
against
the
thick
shaft
of
his
peavy
watching
the
endless
procession
of
the
logs
drifting
by
apparently
he
was
idle
but
in
reality
his
eyes
missed
no
shift
of
the
ordered
ranks
when
a
slight
hitch
or
pause
a
subtle
change
in
the
pattern
of
the
brown
carpet
caught
his
attention
he
sprang
into
life
balancing
his
peavy
across
his
body
he
made
his
way
by
short
dashes
to
the
point
of
threatened
congestion
there
working
vigorously
swept
down
stream
with
the
mass
he
pulled
hauled
and
heaved
forcing
the
heavy
reluctant
timbers
from
the
cohesion
that
threatened
trouble
later
oblivious
to
his
surroundings
he
wrenched
and
pried
desperately
the
banks
of
the
river
drifted
by
point
succeeded
point
as
though
withdrawn
up
stream
by
some
invisible
manipulator
the
river
appeared
stationary
the
banks
in
motion
finally
he
heard
at
his
elbow
the
voice
of
the
man
stationed
below
him
who
had
run
out
from
his
own
point
bill
he
replied
to
this
man
old
slough
hog
tie
into
this
this
the
time
agreed
bill
cheerfully
in
a
few
moments
the
danger
was
averted
the
logs
ran
free
the
rivermen
thereupon
made
their
uncertain
way
back
to
shore
where
they
took
the
river
trail
up
stream
again
to
their
respective
posts
at
noon
they
ate
lunches
they
had
brought
with
them
in
little
canvas
bags
snatched
before
they
left
the
rollways
from
a
supply
handy
by
the
cook
in
the
meantime
the
main
crew
were
squatting
in
the
lea
of
the
brush
devouring
a
hot
meal
which
had
been
carried
to
them
in
wooden
boxes
strapped
to
the
backs
of
the
chore
boys
down
the
river
and
up
its
tributaries
other
crews
both
in
the
employ
of
newmark
and
orde
and
of
others
were
also
pausing
from
their
cold
and
dangerous
toil
the
river
refreshed
after
its
long
winter
bent
its
mighty
back
to
the
great
annual
burden
laid
upon
it
by
the
end
of
the
second
day
the
logs
actually
in
the
bed
of
the
stream
had
been
shaken
loose
and
a
large
proportion
of
them
had
floated
entirely
from
sight
it
now
became
necessary
to
break
down
the
rollways
piled
along
the
tops
of
the
banks
the
evening
of
this
day
however
orde
received
a
visit
from
jim
denning
the
foreman
of
the
next
section
below
bringing
with
him
charlie
the
cook
of
daly

him
by
the
larger
fire
jim
denning

his
principal

days

story

greeted

cook
when
the
latter

before
him

of

flags
in
the
dance
hall
i
was
very
sleepy
when
in
blew
old
man
heinzman
and
mcneill
himself
i
just
lay
low
for
black
ducks
and
heard
their
talk
they
took
a
look
around
but
did
see
no
one
so
they
opened
her
up
did
you
hear
asked
orde
mcneill
he
agreed
to
get
a
gang
of
bad
ones
from
the
saginaw
to
run
in
on
the
river
and
i
heard
heinzman
tell
him
to
send
in
to
headwaters
and
mcneill
said
all
right
about
the
cash
heinzman
but
i
been
figgerin
on
gettin
even
with
orde
for
some
myself
that
all
inquired
orde
about
all
confessed
charlie
do
you
know
he
did
hire
them
to
carry
down
his
drive
for
him
he
need
sixty
men
for
his
lower
rollways
and
maybe
they
were
all
to
go
to
headwaters
asked
orde
by
way
of
testing
charlie
beliefs
payin
them
four
dollars
a
day
replied
charlie
simply
who
pay
that
fer
just
river
work
orde
nodded
at
jim
denning
on
charlie
said
he
are
you
giving
all
this
away
if
you
were
working
for
heinzman
working
for
you
now
replied
charlie
with
dignity
besides
you
helped
me
out
once
guess
it
a
straight
tip
all
right
said
orde
to
denning
when
the
cook
had
resumed
his
place
by
the
fire
what
i
thought
that
why
i
brought
him
that
crew
been
sent
in
there
it
means
only
one
thing
at
that
end
of
the
line
said
orde
they
sent
up
to
waste
out
the
water
in
the
reservoir
and
hang
this
end
of
the
drive
replied
denning
said
orde
old
skunk
knows
his
own
rollways
are
so
far
down
stream
that
he
safe
flood
water
or
no
flood
a
pause
ensued
during
which
the
two
smoked
vigorously
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
asked
denning
at
last
would
you
do
countered
orde
said
denning
slowly
and
with
a
certain
grim
joy
do
bet
those
saginaw
are
any
more
than
the
boys
on
this
river
i
go
up
and
clean
do
negatived
orde
briefly
the
first
place
as
you
know
very
well
we
now
and
we
ca
spare
the
men
from
the
work
in
the
second
place
we
hang
up
sure
then
to
go
up
in
that
wilderness
fifty
miles
from
civilisation
would
mean
a
row
of
too
big
a
size
to
handle
wo
do
you
get
a
lawyer
suggested
denning
sarcastically
orde
laughed
with
great
our
water
be
by
the
time
he
got
an
injunction
for
us
he
fell
into
a
brown
study
during
which
his
pipe
went
out
he
said
finally
is
a
fair
game
i
do
know
what
to
do
delay
will
hang
us
taking
men
off
the
work
will
hang
us
i
just
got
to
go
up
there
myself
and
see
what
can
be
done
by
talking
to
to
them
denning
snorted
might
as
well
whistle
down
the
of
hell
if
they
just
up
there
for
a
row
there
be
whisky
in
camp
and
you
can
bet
mcneill
got
some
of
instructed
on
your
account
they
kill
you
sure
agree
with
you
it
risky
replied
orde
scared
i
willing
to
admit
it
but
i
do
see
what
else
to
do
of
course
he
got
no
rights
but
what
the
hell
good
does
that
do
us
after
our
water
is
gone
and
jim
my
son
if
we
hang
this
drive
i
be
buried
so
deep
i
never
will
dig
out
no
i
got
to
go
you
can
stay
up
here
in
charge
of
the
rear
until
i
get
back
send
word
by
charlie
who
to
boss
your
division
while
you
xxiii
orde
tramped
back
to
sawyer
early
next
morning
hitched
into
the
light
buckboard
the
excellent
team
with
which
later
when
the
drive
should
spread
out
he
would
make
his
longest
jumps
and
drove
to
he
arrived
in
sight
of
the
dam
about
three
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
he
pulled
up
to
survey
the
scene
a
group
of
three
small
marked
the
johnson
and
later
the
heinzman
camp
from
the
chimneys
a
smoke
arose
twenty
or
thirty
rivermen
lounged
about
the
sunny
side
of
the
largest
structure
they
had
evidently
just
arrived
for
some
of
their
were
still
piled
outside
the
door
orde
clucked
to
his
horses
and
the
spidery
wheels
of
the
buckboard
swung
lightly
over
the
wet
hummocks
of
the
clearing
to
come
to
a
stop
opposite
the
men
orde
leaned
forward
against
his
knees
boys
said
he
cheerfully
no
one
replied
though
two
or
three
nodded
surlily
orde
looked
them
over
with
some
interest
they
were
a
dirty
unkempt
unshaven
lot
with
bloodshot
eyes
a
flicker
of
the
in
expression
beyond
the
first
youth
hardened
into
an
enduring
toughness
of
fibre
bad
men
from
the
saginaw
in
truth
and
unless
orde
was
mistaken
men
just
off
a
drunk
and
therefore
especially
dangerous
men
eager
to
fight
at
the
drop
of
the
hat
or
sooner
to
be
accommodating
and
ready
to
employ
in
their
assaults
all
the
formidable
and
terrifying
weapons
of
the
reckless
hard
irreverrent
blasphemous
to
be
gained
over
by
no
words
fair
or
foul
absolutely
scornful
of
any
and
all
institutions
imposed
on
them
by
any
other
but
the
few
men
whom
they
acknowledged
as
their
leaders
and
to
master
these
men
respect
there
needed
either
superlative
strength
superlative
recklessness
or
superlative
skill
your
boss
asked
orde
rough
red
growled
one
of
the
men
without
moving
orde
had
heard
of
this
man
of
his
personality
and
his
deeds
like
silver
jack
of
the
muskegon
his
exploits
had
been
celebrated
in
song
a
big
man
with
a
red
beard
they
had
told
him
with
little
flickering
eyes
a
huge
voice
that
bellowed
through
the
woods
in
a
torrent
of
commands
and
imprecations
strong
as
a
bull
and
savage
as
a
wild
beast
a
hint
of
his
quality
will
suffice
from
the
many
stories
circulated
about
him
it
was
said
that
while
jobbing
for
morrison
and
daly
in
some
of
that
firm
saginaw
valley
holdings
the
rough
red
had
discovered
that
a
horse
had
gone
lame
he
called
the
driver
of
that
team
before
him
seized
an
iron
starting
bar
and
with
it
broke
the
leg
th
lameness
yourself
barney
mallan
said
he
to
appeal
to
the
charity
of
such
a
man
would
be
utterly
useless
orde
saw
this
point
he
picked
up
his
reins
and
spoke
to
his
team
but
before
the
horses
had
taken
three
steps
a
huge
riverman
had
planted
himself
squarely
in
the
way
the
others
rising
slowly
surrounded
the
rig
do
know
what
you
up
here
for
growled
the
man
at
the
heads
you
wanted
to
see
the
boss
and
i
guess
you
better
see
intend
to
see
him
said
orde
sharply
out
of
the
way
and
let
me
hitch
my
he
drove
deliberately
ahead
forcing
the
man
to
step
aside
and
stopped
his
horses
by
a
stub
he
tied
them
there
and
descended
to
lean
his
back
also
against
the
log
walls
of
the
little
house
after
a
few
moments
a
huge
form
appeared
above
the
river
bank
at
some
forty
rods
distance
he
comes
now
vouchsafed
the
man
nearest
orde
orde
made
out
the
great
square
figure
of
the
boss
his
soft
hat
his
flaming
red
beard
his
dingy
mackinaw
coat
his
dingy
checked
flannel
shirt
his
dingy
blue
trousers
tucked
into
high
socks
and
instead
of
driving
boots
his
ordinary
lumberman
rubbers
as
a
spot
of
colour
he
wore
a
flaming
red
knit
sash
with
tassels
before
he
had
approached
near
enough
to
be
plainly
distinguishable
he
began
to
bellow
at
the
men
commanding
them
with
a
mighty
array
of
oaths
to
wake
up
and
get
the
open
in
a
moment
or
so
he
had
disappeared
behind
some
bushes
that
intervened
in
his
approach
to
the
house
his
course
through
them
could
be
traced
by
the
top
of
his
cap
which
just
showed
above
them
in
a
moment
he
thrust
through
the
brush
and
stood
before
orde
for
a
moment
he
stared
at
the
young
man
and
then
with
a
wild
irish
yell
leaped
upon
him
orde
caught
unawares
and
in
an
awkward
position
was
hardly
able
even
to
struggle
against
the
gigantic
riverman
indeed
before
he
had
recovered
his
faculties
to
the
point
of
offering
determined
resistance
he
was
pinned
back
against
the
wall
by
his
shoulders
and
the
rough
red
face
was
within
two
feet
of
his
own
how
are
ye
ye
ould
darlint
shouted
the
latter
with
a
roll
of
oaths
jimmy
bourke
cried
orde
and
burst
into
a
laugh
the
rough
red
jerked
him
to
his
feet
delivered
a
bear
hug
that
nearly
crushed
his
ribs
and
pounded
him
mightily
on
the
back
ould
snoozer
he
bellowed
the
blankety
blank
in
blank
did
you
come
from
byes
he
shouted
to
the
men

jimmy
said
he
do

old
enough
for

the
rough
red
grinned
for
ye
said
he
what
have
ye
been
doing
all
these
years
just
it
jimmy
said
orde
drawing
the
giant
one
side
out
of
my
eggs

in
one
basket
and
it
a
mean
trick
of
you
to
hire
out
for
filthy
lucre
to
kick

do
ye
mane
asked
the
rough
red
fixing
his
twinkling
little
eyes
on
orde
do
mean
to
tell
me
countered
orde
glancing
down
at
the
other
feet
this
crew
has
been
sent
up
here
just
to
break
out
those
measly
little
rollways
said
the
rough
red
hell
no

my
bodyguard
they
can
lick
their
weight
in
wild
cats
and
i
loike
well
to

the

we
were
sint
here
to
why

replied
the
rough
red
easily
boss
and
the
blank
of
a
blank
blanked
blank
that
attimptin
to
droive
this
river
has
some
sort
of
a
said
orde
you

that
i
am
the
gentleman
last
mentioned
driving
this
river
and
that
my
you
got
hid
away
somewhere
here
and
that
my
water
you
planning
to
waste
repeated
the
rough
red
but
in
a
different
tone
of
voice
right
said
orde
in
a
tone
of
vast
astonishment
the
rough
red
mentioned
his
probable
deserts
in
the
future
life
here
jack
said
he
after
a
moment
a
crew
of
birlers
that
ye
ca
beat
nowheres
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
now
gettin
four
dollars
a

ould
villain
heinzman
so
we
can
afford
to
wurrk
for
you
orde
hesitated
please
do
now
darlint
wheedled
the
rough
red
his
little
eyes
agleam
with
mischief
us
some
oakum
and
pitch
and
we
caulk
yure
wanigan
for

and
that
the
way
she
be
come
now
dear
and
ai
ye
now
orde
slapped
his
knee
and
laughed
is
sure
one
hell
of
a
joke
he
cried
ai
it
now
said
the
rough
red
smiling
with
as
much
ingratiation
as
he
was
able
take
you
boys
on
said
orde
at
last
the
usual
wages
dollar
and
a
half
for
the
jam
three
for
the
rear
i
doubt
if
you
see
much
of
heinzman
money
when
this
leaks
xxiv
thus
orde
by
the
sheer
good
luck
that
sometimes
favours
men
engaged
in
large
enterprises
not
only
frustrated
a
plan
likely
to
bring
failure
to
his
interests
but
filled
up
his
crews
it
may
be
remarked
here
as
well
as
later
that
the
of
the
stayed
with
the
drive
to
its
finish
and
proved
reliable
and
tractable
in
every
particular
orde
scattered
them
judiciously
so
there
was
no
friction
with
the
local
men
the
rough
red
he
retained
on
the
rear
here
the
breaking
of
the
rollways
had
reached
a
stage
more
exciting
both
to
onlooker
and
participant
than
the
mere
opening
of
the
river
channel
huge
stacks
of
logs
piled
sidewise
to
the
bank
lined
the
stream
for
miles
when
the
lowermost
log
on
the
river
side
was
teased
and
pried
out
the
upper
tiers
were
apt
to
cascade
down
with
a
roar
a
crash
and
a
splash
the
man
who
had
done
the
prying
had
to
be
very
very
cool
and
very
agile
to
avoid
being
buried
under
the
tons
of
timber
that
rushed
down
on
him
only
the
most
reliable
men
were
permitted
at
this
initial
breaking
down
afterwards
the
crew
rolled
in
what
logs
remained
the
rough
red
enormous
strength
spirit
and
nimbleness
of
body
made
him
invaluable
at
this
dangerous
work
orde
too
often
took
a
hand
in
some
of
the
more
ticklish
situations
in
old
days
before
he
had
attained
the
position
of
responsibility
that
raised
the
value
of
his
time
beyond
manual
work
he
had
been
one
of
the
best
men
on
the
river
at
breaking
bank
rollways
a
slim
graceful
handsome
boy
of
twenty
known
as
charlie
also
distinguished
himself
by
the
quickness
and
certainty
of
his
work
often
the
men
standing
near
lost
sight
of
him
entirely
in
the
spray
the
confusion
the
blur
of
the
breaking
rollways
until
it
seemed
certain
he
must
have
perished
nevertheless
always
he
appeared
at
right
or
left
sometimes
even
on
a
log
astream
nonchalant
smiling
escaped
easily
from
the
destructive
power
he
had
loosed
once
in
the
stream
the
logs
ran
their
appointed
course
watched
by
the
men
who
herded
them
on
their
way
and
below
from
the
tributaries
from
the
other
rollways
a
procession
of
recruits
joined
this
great
brown
army
on
its
way
to
the
lake
until
for
miles
and
miles
the
river
was
almost
a
solid
mass
of
logs
the
crews
on
the
various
beats
now
had
their
hands
full
to
keep
the
logs
running
the
slightest
check
at
any
one
point
meant
a
jam
for
there
was
no
way
of
stopping
the
unending
procession
the
logs
behind
floated
gently
against
the
obstruction
and
came
to
rest
the
brown
mass
thickened
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
surface
of
the
water
was
concealed
and
then
as
the
slow
pressure
developed
from
the
three
or
four
miles
of
logs
forced
against
each
other
by
the
pushing
of
the
current
the
breast
of
the
jam
began
to
rise
timbers
crossed
interlocked
slid
one
over
the
other
mounted
higher
and
higher
in
the
formidable
game
of
the
loss
of
which
spelled
death
to
the
players
immediately
and
with
feverish
activity
the
men
nearest
at
hand
attacked
the
work
logs
on
top
they
tumbled
and
rolled
into
the
current
below
men
beneath
the
breast
tugged
and
pried
in
search
of
the
key
logs
causing
all
the
trouble
others
out
the
wings
hoping
to
get
a
around
the
ends
as
the
stoppage
of
the
drive
indicated
to
the
men
up
and
down
stream
that
a
jam
had
formed
they
gathered
at
the
scene
those
from
above
over
the
logs
those
from
below
up
the
river
trail
rarely
unless
in
case
of
unusual
complications
did
it
take
more
than
a
few
hours
at
most
to
break
the
jam
the
breast
of
it
went
out
with
a
rush
more
slowly
the
wings
sucked
in
reluctantly
the
mass
floating
on
the
surface
for
miles
up
stream
stirred
silently
moved
forward
for
a
few
minutes
it
was
necessary
to
watch
carefully
until
the
flow
onward
steadied
itself
until
the
congestion
had
spaced
and
ordered
as
before
then
the
men
moved
back
to
their
posts
the
drive
was
resumed
at
night
the
river
was
necessarily
left
to
its
own
devices
rivermen
with
the
touch
of
superstition
inseparably
connected
with
such
affairs
believe
implicitly
that
run
free
at
certainly
though
it
might
be
expected
that
each
morning
would
reveal
a
big
jam
to
break
such
was
rarely
the
case
the
logs
had
usually
stopped
to
be
sure
but
generally
in
so
peaceful
a
situation
as
easily
to
be
started
on
by
a
few
work
probably
this
was
because
they
tended
to
come
to
rest
in
the
slow
still
reaches
of
the
river
through
which
in
daytime
they
would
be
urged
by
the
rivermen
jams
on
the
river
contrary
to
general
belief
are
of
very
common
occurrence
throughout
the
length
of
the
drive
there
were
probably
three
or
four
a
day
each
of
these
had
to
be
broken
and
in
the
breaking
was
danger
the
smallest
misstep
the
least
slowness
in
reading
the
signs
of
the
break
the
slightest
lack
of
promptness
in
acting
on
the
hint
or
of
agility
in
leaping
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
plunging
timbers
the
faintest
flicker
from
rigid
attention
to
the
antagonist
crouching
on
the
spring
would
mean
instant
death
to
the
delinquent
thus
it
was
literally
true
that
each
one
of
these
men
was
called
upon
almost
daily
to
wager
his
personal
skill
against
his
destruction
in
the
meantime
the
rear
was
its
way
as
fast
as
possible
moving
camp
with
the
wanigan
whenever
necessary
working
very
hard
and
very
cold
and
very
long
in
its
work
however
beyond
the
breaking
of
the
rollways
was
little
of
the
spectacular
orde
after
the
rear
was
well
started
patrolled
the
length
of
the
drive
in
his
light
buckboard
he
had
a
team
of
young
horses
somewhat
fractious
but
capable
on
a
pinch
of
their
hundred
miles
in
a
day
he
handled
them
well
over
the
rough
corduroys
and
swamp
roads
from
jam
to
rear
and
back
again
he
travelled
pausing
on
the
river
banks
to
converse
earnestly
with
one
of
the
foremen
surveying
the
situation
with
the
view
of
the
general
at
times
he
remained
at
one
camp
for
several
days
watching
the
trend
of
the
work
the
improvements
made
during
the
preceding
summer
gave
him
the
greatest
satisfaction
especially
the
apron
at
the
falls
have
had
a
dozen
bad
jams
here
before
now
with
all
these
logs
in
the
river
said
he
to
tim
nolan
who
was
in
charge
of
that
beat
as
it
is
said
tim
had
but
the
one
little
wing
the
piers
to
define
the
channel
along
certain
shallows
also
saved
the
rear
crew
much
labour
in
the
matter
of
stranded
logs
everything
was
very
satisfactory
even
old
man
reed
held
to
his
chastened
attitude
and
made
no
trouble
in
fact
he
seemed
glad
to
turn
an
honest
penny
by
boarding
the
small
crew
in
charge
of
sluicing
the
logs
no
trouble
was
experienced
until
heinzman
rollways
were
reached
here
orde
had
as
he
had
promised
his
partner
boomed
a
free
channel
to
prevent
heinzman
from
filling
up
the
entire
with
his
rollways
when
the
jam
of
the
drive
had
descended
the
river
as
far
as
this
orde
found
that
heinzman
had
not
yet
begun
to
break
out
hardly
had
first
crew
passed
however
when
heinzman
men
began
to
break
down
the
logs
into
the
drive
long
before
the
rear
had
caught
up
all
drive
was
in
the
water
inextricably
mingled
with
the
sixty
or
eighty
million
feet
orde
had
in
charge
the
situation
was
plain
all
heinzman
now
had
to
do
was
to
retain
a
small
crew
which
should
follow
after
the
rear
in
order
to
sack
what
logs
the
latter
should
leave
stranded
this
amounted
practically
to
nothing
as
it
was
impossible
in
so
great
a
mass
of
timbers
and
in
the
haste
of
a
pressing
labour
to
distinguish
or
discriminate
against
any
single
brand
heinzman
was
in
a
fair
way
to
get
his
logs
sent
down
stream
with
practically
no
expense
my
boy
remarked
the
german
quite
frankly
to
orde
as
they
met
on
the
road
one
day
like
i
got
you
dis
time
eh
orde
laughed
also
with
entire
you
mean
your
logs
are
going
down
with
ours
why
i
guess
you
have
but
you
paste
this
in
your
hat
you
going
to
keep
awful
busy
and
it
going
to
cost
you
something
yet
to
get
to
newmark
on
one
of
his
occasional
visits
to
the
camps
orde
detailed
the
situation
does
amount
to
much
said
he
that
it
complicates
matters
we
make
him
scratch
gravel
if
we
have
to
sit
up
nights
and
work
overtime
to
do
it
we
ca
injure
him
or
leave
his
logs
but
we
can
annoy
him
a
the
state
of
affairs
was
perfectly
well
known
to
the
men
and
the
entire
river
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
contest
the
drivers
kept
a
sharp
lookout
for
logs
and
whenever
possible
thrust
them
aside
into
eddies
and
backwaters
this
of
course
merely
made
work
for
the
sackers
heinzman
had
left
above
the
rear
soon
they
were
in
charge
of
a
very
fair
little
drive
of
their
own
their
lot
was
not
enviable
indeed
only
the
pressure
of
work
prevented
some
of
the
more
aggressive
of
rear
among
whom
could
be
numbered
the
rough
red
from
going
back
and
this
impertinent
band
of
one
day
two
of
the
latter
conducting
the
jam
of
the
miniature
drive
astern
came
within
reach
of
the
rough
red
the
latter
had
lingered
in
hopes
of
rescuing
his
peavy
which
had
gone
overboard
to
lose
one
peavy
is
among
rivermen
the
most
mortifying
disgrace
consequently
the
rough
red
was
in
a
fit
mood
for
trouble
he
attacked
the
two
a
desperate
battle
ensued
which
lasted
upward
of
an
hour
the
two
rivermen
punched
kicked
and
battered
the
rough
red
in
a
manner
to
tear
his
clothes
deprive
him
to
some
extent
of
red
whiskers
bloody
his
face
cut
his
shoulder
and
knock
loose
two
teeth
the
rough
red
more
than
the
equal
of
either
man
singly
had
reciprocated
in
kind
orde
driving
in
toward
the
rear
from
a
detour
to
avoid
a
swamp
heard
and
descended
from
his
buckboard
tying
his
horses
to
trees
he
made
his
way
through
the
brush
to
the
scene
of
conflict
so
winded
and
wearied
were
the
belligerents
by
now
that
he
had
no
difficulty
in
separating
them
he
surveyed
their
wrecks
with
a
sardonic
half
smile
call
this
a
draw
said
he
finally
his
attitude
became
threatening
as
the
two
men
recovering
somewhat
showed
ugly
symptoms
he
commanded
i
guess
you
do
know
me
i
jack
orde
jimmy
and
i
together
could
do
a
dozen
of
he
menaced
them
until
muttering
they
had
turned
away
jimmy
said
he
humorously
look
as
if
you
been
run
through
a
thrashing
fellers
make
me
sick
growled
the
rough
red
orde
looked
him
over
again
look
sick
said
he
when
the
buckboard
drew
into
camp
orde
sent
bourke
away
to
repair
damages
while
he
called
the
cookee
to
help
unpack
several
heavy
boxes
of
hardware
they
proved
to
contain
about
thirty
small
hatchets
well
sharpened
and
each
with
a
leather
guard
when
the
rear
crew
had
come
in
that
night
orde
distributed
the
hatchets
said
he
you
on
the
work
i
want
you
all
to
keep
a
for
these
logs
and
whenever
you
strike
one
i
want
you
to
blaze
it
plainly
so
there
wo
be
any
mistake
about
for
asked
one
of
the
saginaw
men
as
he
received
his
hatchet
but
the
riverman
who
squatted
next
nudged
him
with
his
elbow
less
questions
you
ask
jack
the
more
answers
you
get
just
do
what
you
told
to
on
this
river
and
you
see
fun
three
days
later
the
rear
crew
ran
into
the
head
of
the
pond
above
reed
dam
to
every
one
surprise
orde
called
a
halt
on
the
work
and
announced
a
holiday
now
holidays
are
unknown
on
drive
barely
is
time
allowed
for
eating
and
sleeping
nevertheless
all
that
day
the
men
lay
about
in
complete
idleness
smoking
talking
sleeping
in
the
warm
sun
the
river
silenced
by
the
closed
slept
also
the
pond
filled
with
logs
from
above
the
current
aided
by
a
fair
wind
was
driving
down
still
other
logs
the
forerunners
of
the
little
drive
astern
at
sight
of
these
some
of
the
men
grumbled
losin
what
we
made
said
they
left
them
logs
and
sorted
out
once
orde
sent
a
couple
of
to
blaze
the
newcomers
a
little
before
sundown
he
ordered
the
of
the
dam
opened
work
said
the
men
to
one
another
they
knew
of
course
that
in
sluicing
logs
the
gate
must
be
open
a
couple
of
hours
before
the
sluicing
begins
in
order
to
fill
the
below
logs
run
ahead
faster
than
the
water
spreads
sure
enough
after
supper
orde
suddenly
appeared
among
them
the
devil
of
mischief
dancing
in
his
eyes
and
broadening
his
face
organised
boys
said
he
briskly
got
to
get
this
pond
all
sluiced
before
morning
and
there
enough
of
us
here
to
hustle
it
right
the
men
took
their
places
orde
moved
here
and
there
giving
his
directions
through
everything
but
the
logs
he
commanded
them
off
to
the
left
and
leave
twilight
then
dark
fell
after
a
few
moments
the
moon
then
just
past
its
full
rose
behind
the
trees
the
sluicing
under
the
impetus
of
a
big
crew
went
rapidly
bet
there
mighty
near
a
million
an
hour
going
through
there
speculated
orde
watching
the
smooth
swift
but
burdened
waters
of
the
chute
and
in
this
work
the
men
distinguished
easily
the
new
white
on
heinzman
logs
so
they
were
able
without
hesitation
to
shunt
them
one
side
into
the
smoother
water
as
orde
had
commanded
about
two
the
last
log
shot
through
boys
said
orde
out
the
the
chute
to
the
dam
was
approached
as
has
been
earlier
explained
by
two
rows
of
booms
arranged
in
a
v
or
funnel
the
apex
of
which
emptied
into
the
and
the
wide
projecting
arms
of
which
embraced
the
width
of
the
stream
the
logs
floating
down
the
pond
were
thus
concentrated
toward
the
sluice
also
the
rivermen
walking
back
and
forth
the
length
of
the
booms
were
able
easily
to
keep
the
drive
moving
now
however
orde
unchained
these
boom
logs
the
men
pushed
them
ashore
there
as
many
as
could
find
room
on
either
side
the
clamped
in
their
peavies
and
using
these
implements
as
handles
carried
the
booms
some
distance
back
into
the
woods
then
everybody
tramped
back
and
forth
round
and
about
to
confuse
the
trail
orde
was
like
a
mischievous
boy
at
a
school
prank
when
the
last
timber
had
been
concealed
he
lifted
up
his
deep
voice
in
a
roar
of
joy
in
which
the
crew
joined
let
turn
in
for
a
little
sleep
said
be
this
situation
perhaps
a
little
cloudy
in
the
reader
mind
would
have
cleared
could
he
have
looked
out
over
the
dam
pond
the
following
morning
the
blazed
logs
belonging
to
heinzman
drifting
slowly
had
sucked
down
into
the
corner
toward
the
power
canal
where
caught
against
the
grating
they
had
jammed
these
logs
would
have
to
be
floated
singly
and
pushed
one
by
one
against
the
current
across
the
pond
and
into
the
influence
of
the
some
of
them
would
be
hard
to
come
at
guess
that
will
keep
them
busy
for
a
day
or
two
commented
orde
as
he
followed
the
rear
down
to
where
it
was
sacking
below
the
dam
this
as
orde
had
said
would
be
sufficiently
annoying
to
heinzman
but
would
have
little
real
effect
on
the
main
issue
which
was
that
the
german
was
getting
down
his
logs
with
a
crew
of
less
than
a
dozen
men
nevertheless
orde
in
a
vast
spirit
of
fun
took
delight
in
inventing
and
executing
practical
jokes
of
the
general
sort
just
described
for
instance
at
one
spot
where
he
had
boomed
the
deeper
channel
from
the
rocks
on
either
side
he
shunted
as
many
of
heinzman
logs
as
came
by
handily
through
an
opening
he
had
made
in
the
booms
there
they
grounded
on
the
shallows
more
work
for
the
men
following
many
of
the
logs
in
charge
of
the
latter
however
catching
the
free
current
overtook
the
rear
so
that
the
number
of
the
logs
in
the
drive
was
not
materially
diminished
at
first
as
has
been
hinted
these
various
tactics
had
little
effect
one
day
however
the
chore
boy
who
had
been
over
to
spruce
rapids
after
mail
reported
that
an
additional
crew
of
twenty
had
been
sent
in
to
heinzman
drive
this
was
gratifying
making
him
scratch
gravel
boys
anyway
said
orde
the
men
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
in
fact
their
enthusiasm
was
almost
too
exuberant
orde
had
constantly
to
negative
new
and
ingenious
schemes
boys
said
he
want
to
keep
on
the
right
side
of
the
law
we
may
need
it
meanwhile
the
entire
length
of
the
river
was
busy
and
excited
heinzman
logs
were
all
blazed
inside
a
week
the
men
passed
the
hatchets
along
the
line
and
slim
chance
did
a
marked
log
have
of
rescue
once
the
poor
thing
fell
into
difficulties
with
the
strange
and
interesting
tendency
rivermen
and
woodsmen
have
of
personifying
the
elements
of
their
daily
work
the
men
addressed
the
helpless
timbers
in
tones
of
contempt
you
ride
that
rock
you
said
they
got
left
did
you
well
lie
there
and
be
to
you
and
if
chance
offered
and
time
was
not
pressing
the
riverman
would
give
his
helpless
victim
a
jerk
or
so
into
a
more
difficult
position
times
of
rising
water
when
the
above
had
been
opened
were
the
most
prolific
of
opportunities
logs
rarely
jam
on
rising
water
for
the
simple
reason
that
constantly
the
surface
area
of
the
river
is
increasing
thus
tending
to
separate
the
logs
on
the
other
hand
falling
water
tending
to
crowd
the
drive
closer
together
is
especially
prolific
of
trouble
therefore
on
flood
water
the
watchers
scattered
along
the
stretches
of
the
river
had
little
to
do
save
strand
heinzman
logs
for
him
and
when
flood
water
had
passed
some
of
those
logs
were
certainly
high
and
dry
up
to
a
certain
point
this
was
all
very
well
orde
took
pains
not
to
countenance
it
officially
and
caused
word
to
be
passed
about
that
while
he
did
not
expect
his
men
to
help
drive
heinzman
logs
they
must
not
go
out
of
their
way
to
strand
them
things
get
too
bad
he
have
spies
down
here
to
collect
evidence
on
us
said
orde
he
jug
some
of
us
for
interference
with
his
property
we
do
own
the
about
them
booms
asked
the
rough
red
did
own
them
explained
orde
i
had
a
right
to
take
them
up
when
i
had
finished
with
this
hint
was
enough
the
men
did
not
cease
from
a
labour
that
tickled
them
mightily
but
they
adopted
a
code
of
signals
strangers
were
not
uncommon
spectators
came
out
often
from
the
little
towns
and
from
the
farms
when
one
of
these
appeared
the
riverman
nearest
raised
a
long
falsetto
cry
this
was
taken
up
by
his
next
neighbour
and
passed
on
in
a
few
minutes
all
that
section
of
the
drive
knew
that
it
would
be
wise
to
and
inside
of
two
weeks
orde
had
the
great
satisfaction
of
learning
that
heinzman
was
working
and
working
hard
a
crew
of
fifty
men
pretty
fair
crew
even
if
he
was
taking
out
his
whole
drive
commented
orde
the
gods
of
luck
seemed
to
be
with
the
new
enterprise
although
orde
had
of
course
taken
the
utmost
pains
to
foresee
every
contingency
possible
to
guard
against
nevertheless
as
always
when
dealing
with
nature
larger
forces
he
anticipated
some
of
those
gigantic
obstacles
which
continually
render
uncertain
wilderness
work
nothing
of
the
kind
happened
there
formed
none
of
the
tremendous
jams
that
pile
up
several
million
feet
of
logs
tax
every
resource
of
men
horses
and
explosives
and
require
a
week
or
so
to
break
no
men
were
killed
and
only
two
injured
no
unexpected
floods
swept
away
works
on
which
the
drive
depended
the
water
held
out
to
carry
the
last
stick
of
timber
over
the
shallowest
rapids
weather
conditions
were
phenomenal
and
perfect
all
up
and
down
the
river
the
work
went
with
that
vim
and
dash
that
is
in
itself
an
assurance
of
success
the
heinzman
affair
which
under
auspices
of
evil
augury
might
have
become
a
serious
menace
to
the
success
of
the
young
undertaking
now
served
merely
to
add
a
spice
of
humour
to
the
situation
among
the
men
gained
currency
a
belief
in
after
this
happy
fashion
the
drive
went
until
at
last
it
entered
the
broad
deep
and
navigable
stretches
of
the
river
from
redding
to
the
lake
here
barring
the
accident
of
an
extraordinary
flood
the
troubles
were
over
on
the
broad
placid
bosom
of
the
stream
the
logs
would
float
a
crew
following
would
do
the
easy
work
of
sacking
what
logs
would
strand
or
eddy
in
the
lazy
current
would
roll
into
the
faster
waters
the
component
parts
of
what
were
by
courtesy
called
jams
but
which
were
in
reality
of
a
few
hundred
logs
on
sand
bars
and
in
the
growing
tepid
warmth
of
summer
would
tramp
pleasantly
along
the
river
trail
of
course
a
dry
year
would
make
necessary
a
larger
crew
and
more
labour
of
course
a
big
flood
might
sweep
the
logs
past
all
defences
into
the
lake
for
an
irretrievable
loss
but
such
floods
come
once
in
a
century
and
even
the
dryest
of
dry
years
could
not
now
hang
the
drive
as
orde
sat
in
his
buckboard
ready
to
go
into
town
for
a
first
glimpse
of
carroll
in
more
than
two
months
he
gazed
with
an
immense
satisfaction
over
the
broad
river
moving
brown
and
as
though
the
logs
that
covered
it
were
viscid
and
composed
all
its
substance
the
enterprise
was
practically
assured
of
success
for
a
while
now
orde
was
to
have
a
breathing
spell
a
large
number
of
men
were
here
laid
off
the
remainder
under
the
direction
of
jim
denning
would
require
little
or
no
actual
supervision
until
the
jam
should
have
reached
the
distributing
booms
above
monrovia
the
affair
was
very
simple
before
he
left
however
he
called
denning
to
him
said
he
be
down
to
see
you
through
the
sluiceways
at
redding
of
course
but
now
that
you
have
a
good
still
stretch
of
river
i
want
you
to
have
the
boys
let
up
on
sacking
out
those
logs
and
i
want
you
to
include
in
our
drive
all
the
heinzman
logs
from
above
you
possibly
can
if
you
can
fix
it
let
their
drive
drift
down
into
ours
we
have
to
drive
their
logs
for
them
objected
denning
rejoined
orde
it
easy
driving
and
if
that
crew
of
his
has
much
to
do
perhaps
he
lay
most
of
them
off
here
at
denning
looked
at
his
principal
for
a
moment
then
a
slow
grin
overspread
his
face
without
comment
he
turned
back
to
camp
and
orde
took
up
his
reins
xxv
i
so
glad
to
get
you
back
cried
carroll
over
and
over
again
as
she
clung
to
him
do
live
while
you
away
and
every
drop
of
rain
that
patters
on
the
roof
chills
my
heart
because
i
think
of
it
as
chilling
you
and
every
creak
of
this
old
house
at
night
brings
me
up
broad
awake
because
i
hear
in
it
the
crash
of
those
cruel
great
timbers
oh
oh
oh
i
so
glad
to
get
you
you
the
light
of
my
life
you
my
whole
life
itself
she
smiled
at
him
from
her
perch
on
his
knee
silly
am
i
not
she
said
heart
do
leave
me
got
to
support
an
extravagant
wife
you
know
orde
reminded
her
gravely
know
of
course
she
breathed
bending
lightly
to
him
have
your
work
in
the
world
to
do
and
i
would
not
have
it
otherwise
it
is
great
work
wonderful
work
i
been
asking
orde
laughed
work
just
like
any
other
and
it
hard
work
said
he
she
shook
her
head
at
him
slowly
a
mysterious
smile
on
her
lips
without
explaining
her
thought
she
slipped
from
his
knee
and
glided
across
to
the
tall
golden
harp
which
had
been
brought
from
monrovia
the
light
and
diaphanous
silk
of
her
loose
peignoir
floated
about
her
defining
the
maturing
grace
of
her
figure
abruptly
she
struck
a
great
crashing
chord
then
with
an
abandon
of
ecstasy
she
plunged
into
one
of
those
wild
and
rhapsodies
of
the
hungarians
full
of
the
wind
in
rigging
the
storm
in
the
pines
of
shrieking
vast
forces
hurtling
unchained
through
a
resounding
and
infinite
space
as
though
deep
down
in
primeval
nature
the
powers
of
the
world
had
been
loosed
back
and
forth
here
and
there
erratic
and
swift
and
sudden
as
lightning
the
theme
played
breathless
it
fell
is
that
gasped
orde
surprised
to
find
himself
tense
his
blood
rioting
his
soul
stirred
she
ran
to
him
to
hide
her
face
in
his
neck
it
you
you
you
she
cried
he
held
her
to
him
closely
until
her
excitement
had
died
you
think
it
is
good
to
get
quite
so
nervous
sweetheart
he
asked
gently
then
i
do
i
do
she
broke
in
earnestly
moment
of
my
waking
and
sleeping
hours
i
remember
him
always
i
keep
his
little
soul
before
me
as
a
light
on
a
shrine
but
oh
i
could
laugh
and
shout
aloud
like
the
people
in
the
bible
with
clapping
of
she
snuggled
herself
close
to
orde
with
a
little
murmur
of
happiness
think
of
all
the
beautiful
things
she
whispered
of
the
noble
things
and
of
the
great
things
he
is
going
to
be
sturdy
like
his
father
a
wonderful
boy
a
boy
all
of
fire
his
mother
said
orde
she
smiled
up
at
him
want
him
just
like
you
dear
she
pleaded
xxvi
three
days
later
the
jam
of
the
drive
reached
the
dam
at
redding
orde
took
carroll
downtown
in
the
buckboard
there
a
seat
by
the
little
house
was
given
her
back
of
the
brick
factory
buildings
next
the
power
canal
whence
for
hours
she
watched
the
slow
onward
movement
of
the
sullen
brown
timbers
the
smooth
rush
of
the
waters
through
the
chute
the
graceful
certain
movements
of
the
rivermen
some
of
the
latter
were
brought
up
by
orde
and
introduced
they
were
very
awkward
and
somewhat
embarrassed
but
they
all
looked
her
straight
in
the
eye
and
carroll
felt
somehow
that
back
of
their
diffidence
they
were
quite
dispassionately
appraising
her
after
a
few
gracious
speeches
on
her
part
and
monosyllabic
responses
on
theirs
they
blundered
away
in
spite
of
the
scant
communication
these
interviews
left
something
of
a
friendly
feeling
on
both
sides
like
your
jim
denning
she
told
orde
a
nice
fellow
and
bourke
she
laughed
he
funny
with
his
fierce
red
beard
and
his
little
eyes
but
he
simply
adores
orde
laughed
at
the
idea
of
the
rough
red
adoring
anybody
so
she
insisted
i
like
him
for
it
only
i
wish
he
were
a
little
she
thought
the
feats
of
little
less
than
wonderful
and
you
may
be
sure
the
knowledge
of
her
presence
did
not
discourage
spectacular
display
finally
johnny
challan
uttering
a
loud
whoop
leaped
aboard
a
log
and
went
through
the
chute
standing
bolt
upright
by
a
marvel
of
agility
he
kept
his
balance
through
the
below
and
emerged
finally
into
the
lower
waters
still
proudly
upright
and
dry
above
the
knees
carroll
had
arisen
the
better
to
see
she
cried
aloud
marvellous
circus
riding
is
nothing
to
it
replied
a
gigantic
riverman
who
was
working
near
at
hand
ai
nothin
ordinary
however
we
travel
that
way
on
the
river
at
night
we
have
the
cookee
pass
us
out
each
a
piller
and
lay
down
for
the
carroll
looked
at
him
in
reproof
he
grinned
slowly
git
worried
about
me
said
he
hopeless
for
twenty
year
now
i
been
wearin
crape
on
my
hat
in
memory
of
my
departed
after
the
rear
had
dropped
down
river
from
redding
carroll
and
orde
returned
to
their
deserted
little
box
of
a
house
at
monrovia
orde
breathed
deep
of
a
new
satisfaction
in
walking
again
the
streets
of
this
little
sandy
shantyfied
town
with
its
yellow
hills
and
its
wide
blue
river
and
its
glimpse
of
the
lake
far
in
the
offing
it
had
never
meant
anything
to
him
before
now
he
enjoyed
every
brick
and
board
of
it
he
trod
the
broken
aromatic
shingles
of
the
roadway
with
pleasure
he
tramped
up
the
broad
stairs
and
down
the
dark
hall
of
the
block
with
anticipation
he
breathed
the
compounded
office
odour
of
ledgers
cocoa
matting
and
old
cigar
smoke
in
a
long
reminiscent
whiff
he
took
his
seat
at
his
desk
enchanted
to
be
again
in
these
homely
though
familiar
surroundings
if
i
know
what
struck
me
he
mused
experienced
any
remarkable
joy
before
in
getting
back
to
this
sort
of
then
with
a
warm
glow
at
the
heart
the
realisation
was
brought
to
him
this
was
home
and
over
yonder
under
the
shadow
of
the
spire
a
slip
of
a
girl
was
waiting
for
him
he
tried
to
tell
her
this
when
next
he
saw
her
felt
that
i
ought
to
make
you
a
little
shrine
and
burn
candles
to
you
the
way
the
catholics
do
the
mater
dolorosa
she
mocked
he
looked
at
her
dark
eyes
so
full
of
the
sweetness
of
content
at
her
sensitive
lips
with
the
quaintly
upturned
corners
and
he
thought
of
what
her
home
life
had
been
and
of
the
real
sorrow
that
even
yet
must
smoulder
somewhere
down
in
the
deeps
of
her
being
said
he
slowly
that
i
think
my
shrine
will
be
dedicated
to
our
lady
of
the
joyous
the
rest
of
the
week
orde
was
absent
up
the
river
superintending
in
a
general
way
the
latter
progress
of
the
drive
looking
into
the
needs
of
the
crews
arranging
for
supplies
the
mills
were
all
working
now
busily
cutting
into
the
residue
of
last
season
logs
soon
they
would
need
more
at
the
booms
everything
was
in
readiness
to
receive
the
jam
the
long
swing
arm
slanting
across
the
river
channel
was
attached
to
its
winch
which
would
operate
it
when
shut
it
would
close
the
main
channel
and
shunt
into
the
booms
the
logs
floating
in
the
river
there
penned
at
last
by
the
piles
driven
in
a
row
and
held
together
at
the
top
by
bolted
timbers
they
would
lie
quiet
men
armed
with
would
then
take
up
the
work
of
distribution
according
to
the
brands
stamped
on
the
ends
each
brand
had
its
own
separate
pens
the
lower
end
leading
again
into
the
open
river
from
these
each
owner
property
was
rafted
and
towed
to
his
private
booms
at
his
mill
below
orde
spent
the
day
before
the
jam
appeared
in
constructing
what
he
called
a
of
my
own

explained
to
newmark
invention
just
yet
i
going
to
hold
up
the
drive
in
the
main
river
until
we
have
things
bunched
then
i
going
to
throw
a
big
crew
down
here
by
the
swing

anticipates
of
course
that
i
run
the
entire
drive
into
the
booms
and
do
all
my
sorting
there
naturally
if
i
turn
his
logs
loose
into
the
river
as
fast
as
i
run
across
them
he
will
be
able
to
pick
them
up
one
at
a
time
for
he
only
get
them
occasionally
if
i
keep
them
until
everything
else
is
sorted
only
heinzman
logs
will
remain
and
as
we
have
no
right
to
hold
logs
we
have
to
turn
them
loose
through
the
lower
sorting
booms
where
he
can
be
ready
to
raft
them
in
that
way
he
gets
them
all
right
without
paying
us
a
cent
see
i
see
said
newmark
said
orde
with
a
laugh
is
where
i
fool
him
i
going
to
rush
the
drive
into
the
booms
all
at
once
but
i
going
to
sort
out
heinzman
logs
at
these
openings
near
the
entrance
and
turn
them
into
the
main
good
will

do

the

with

and
if
he
do
stop
them
this
side
his

he
have
to

tow
them
back
and
if
he
do

the

he
may
as
well

say
a
word
anywhere
warned
orde
is
the
watchword
of
success
with
this
merry
little
the
boomerang
worked
like
a
charm
the
men
had
been
grumbling
at
an
apparently
peaceful
yielding
of
the
point
at
issue
and
would
have
sacked
out
many
of
the
blazed
logs
if
orde
had
not
held
them
rigidly
to
it
now
their
spirits
flamed
into
joy
again
the
sorting
went
like
clockwork
orde
in
personal
charge
watched
that
through
the
different
openings
in
his
the
logs
were
shunted
into
the
river
shortly
the
channel
was
full
of
logs
floating
merrily
away
down
the
little
blue
wavelets
after
a
while
orde
handed
over
his
job
to
tom
north

how
the

one
of
the
crew

shouted
back
he
drove
the
team
and
buckboard
down
the
marsh
road
to
heinzman
mill
there
he
found
evidences
of
the
wildest
excitement
the
mill
had
been
closed
down
and
all
the
men
turned
in
to
rescue
logs
boats
plied
in
all
directions
a
tug
darted
back
and
forth
constantly
the
number
of
floating
logs
augmented
however
many
had
already
gone
by
you
think
you
busy
now
said
orde
to
himself
with
a
chuckle

until

watched
for
a
few
moments
in
silence

doing
with
that
tug

across
the
river
to
hold
the
whole

laughed
aloud
turned
his
team
about
and
drove
frantically
back
to
the
booms
every
few
moments
he
chuckled
his
eyes
danced
hardly
could
he
wait
to
get
there
once
at
the
camp
he
leaped
from
the
buckboard
with
a
shout
to
the
stableman
and
ran
rapidly
out
over
the
booms
to
where
the
sorting
of

was
going
merrily
forward

he
added
as
an
afterthought
stringing
booms
across
the
river
obstructing
he
ran
down
the
length
of
the
whole
boom
to
where
lay
the
two
tugs
he
called
when
still
some
distance
away
up
steam
there
appeared
a
short
square
man
with
hard
brown
cheeks
a
heavy
bleached
flaxen
moustache
and
eyes
steady
unwavering
and
as
blue
as
the
sky
in
two
minutes
he
answered
and
descended
from
the
pilot
house
to
shout
down
a
low
door
leading
from
the
deck
into
the
engine
room
he
commanded
her
up
a
tall
negro
reached
the
upper
half
of
his
body
from
the
low
door
to
seize
an
armful
of
the
slabs
piled
along
the
narrow
deck
ten
minutes
later
the
sprite
a
cloud
of
white
smoke
pouring
from
her
funnel

careening
down

stretch
of

strongly
under
the

of
her
powerful
rudder
to
avoid

an
some
timbers
fairly
flung
aside
by
the
wash
the
displacement
of
the
rapid
running
seemed
almost
to
press
the
water
above
the
level
of
the
deck
on
either
side
and
about
ten
feet
from
the
gunwale
as
the
low
marshes
and
flew
past
orde
noted
with
satisfaction
that
many
of
the
logs
urged
one
side
by
the
breeze
had
found
lodgment
among
the
reeds
and
in
the
bayous
and
inlets
one
at
a
time
and
painfully
these
would
have
to
be
salvaged
in
a
short
time
the
mills
tall
smokestacks
loomed
in
sight
the
logs
thickened
until
it
was
with
difficulty
that
captain
marsh
could
thread
his
way
among
them
at
all
shortly
orde
standing
by
the
wheel
in
the
could
see
down
the
stretches
of
the
river
a
crowd
of
men
working
antlike
got
stopped
commented
orde
at
that
gang
working
from
boats
they
have
a
dozen
boots
among
do
you
want
me
to
do
asked
captain
marsh
is
a
navigable
river
is
it
replied
orde
through
marsh
rang
for
and
began
to
nose
his
way
gently
through
the
loosely
floating
logs
soon
the
tug
had
reached
the
scene
of
activity
and
headed
straight
for
the
slender
line
of
booms
hitched
end
to
end
and
stretching
quite
across
the
river
afraid
we
just
ride
over
them
if
we
hit
them
too
slow
suggested
marsh
orde
looked
at
his
watch
be
late
for
the
mail
unless
we
hurry
said
he
marsh
whirled
the
spokes
of
his
wheel
over
and
rang
the
bell
the
water
churned
white
behind
the
tug
careened
you
do
stop
cried
heinzman
from
one
of
the
boats
orde
stuck
his
head
from
the
door
obstructing
navigation
he
yelled
got
to
go
to
town
to
buy
a
the
prow
of
the
tug
accurately
aimed
by
marsh
hit
square
in
the
junction
of
two
of
the
booms
immediately
the
water
was
agitated
on
both
sides
and
for
a
hundred
feet
or
so
by
the
pressure
of
the
long
poles
sidewise
there
ensued
a
moment
of
strain
then
the
links
snapped
and
the
sprite
plunged
joyously
through
the
opening
the
booms
swept
aside
by
the
current
floated
to
either
shore
the
river
was
open
orde
his
head
still
out
the
door
looked
back
down
marsh
said
he
see
the
already
the
logs
caught
by
the
booms
had
taken
their
motion
and
had
swept
past
the
opening
although
the
lonesome
tug
heinzman
had
on
the
work
immediately
picked
up
one
end
of
the
broken
boom
and
with
it
started
out
into
the
river
she
found
difficulty
in
making
headway
against
the
sweep
of
the
logs
after
a
long
struggle
she
reached
the
middle
of
the
river
where
she
was
able
to
hold
her
own
what
next
speculated
orde
are
they
going
to
get
the
other
end
of
the
booms
out
from
the
other
bank
captain
marsh
had
reversed
the
sprite
the
tug
lay
nearly
motionless
amidstream
her
propeller
slowly
revolving
up
river
all
the
small
boats
gathered
in
a
line
connected
one
to
the
other
by
a
rope
the
tug
passed
over
to
them
the
cable
attached
to
the
boom
evidently
the
combined
efforts
of
the
rowboats
were
counted
on
to
hold
the
across
the
current
while
the
tug
brought
out
the
other
half
when
the
tug
dropped
the
cable
orde
laughed
but
a
dutchman
would
have
thought
of
that
he
cried
for
the
fun
immediately
the
weight
fell
on
the
small
boats
they
were
dragged
irresistibly
backward
even
from
a
distance
the
three
men
on
the
sprite
could
make
out
the
as
the
oars
splashed
and
churned
and
frantically
caught
crabs
in
a
vain
effort
to
hold
their
own
marsh
lowered
his
telescope
the
tears
streaming
down
his
face
better
than
a
goat
fight
said
he
futilely
protesting
the
rowboats
were
dragged
backward
turned
as
a
whip
is
snapped
and
strung
out
along
the
bank
below
have
to
have
two
tugs
before
they
can
close
the
break
that
way
commented
orde
thing
replied
captain
marsh
but
at
that
moment
a
black
smoke
rolled
up
over
the
marshes
and
shortly
around
the
bend
from
above
came
the
lucy
belle
the
lucy
belle
was
the
main
excuse
for
calling
the
river
navigable
she
made
trips
as
often
as
she
could
between
redding
and
monrovia
in
luck
she
could
cover
the
forty
miles
in
a
day
it
was
no
unusual
thing
however
for
the
lucy
belle
to
hang
up
indefinitely
on
some
one
of
the
numerous
shifting
sand
bars
for
that
reason
she
carried
more
imperishable
freight
than
passengers
in
appearance
she
was
with
twin
smokestacks
an
iron
indian
on
her
top
and
a
comes
his
help
said
orde
simpson
would
stop
to
pick
up
a
bogus
sure
enough
on
hail
from
one
of
the
rowboats
the
lucy
belle
slowed
down
and
stopped
after
a
short
conference
she
steamed
clumsily
over
to
get
hold
of
one
end
of
the
booms
the
tug
took
the
other
in
time
and
by
dint
of
much
splashing
some
collisions
and
several
attempts
the
ends
of
the
booms
were
united
by
this
time
however
nearly
all
the
logs
had
escaped
the
tug
towing
a
string
of
rowboats
set
out
in
pursuit
the
sprite
continued
on
her
way
until
beyond
sight
then
she
slowed
down
again
the
lucy
belle
churned
around
the
bend
and
turned
in
toward
the
tug
going
to
speak
us
marvelled
orde
wonder
what
the
dickens
she
ahoy
bellowed
a
individual
from
the
upper
deck
he
was
dressed
in

and
brass
buttons

in

marsh
choking
the

heinzman

the
sprite
coming
and
rowed
out

splashing
at

stroke

yelling
with
every
breath

vituperated
and
pounded
the

marsh
said
orde
the
tug
gathered
way
soon
heinzman
was
forced
to
let
go
for
a
second
time
the
chains
were
snapped
orde
and
marsh
looked
back
over
the
churning
wake
left
by
the
sprite
the
severed
ends
of
the
booms
were
swinging
back
toward
either
shore
between
them
floated
a
rowboat
in
the
rowboat
gesticulated
a
pudgy
man
the
river
was
well
sprinkled
with
logs
evidently
the
sorting
was
going
on
well
as
well

back
to
the

orde
wo
string
them
together
again
not
if

waits
for

sent

accordingly
they
returned
to
the
booms
where
work
was
suspended
while
orde
detailed
to
an
appreciative
audience
the
happenings
below
this
tickled
the
men
immensely
we
hai
sorted
out
more
a
million
feet
of
his
logs
cried
rollway
charlie
hai
seen
no
logs
yet
they
turned
with
new
enthusiasm
to
the
work
of
shunting
logs
into
the
channel
in
ten
minutes
however
the
stableman
picked
his
way
out
over
the
booms
with
a
message
for
orde
heinzman

and
wants

see

said
he
orde
and
jim

the

pacing
restlessly
up
and
down
before
a
steaming
pair
of
horses

perched
on
a
stump

surveying
him
sardonically
and
chewing
the
end
of
an
unlighted
cigar

easy
if

into
the

laughed
again
want
to
get
down
to
business
almighty
when
finally
heinzman
had
driven
sadly
away
and
the
whole
drive
logs
included
was
pouring
into
the
main
boom
orde
stretched
his
arms
over
his
head
in
a
luxury
of
satisfaction
just
about
settles
that
campaign
he
said
to
newmark
no
it
does
replied
the
latter
decidedly
asked
orde
surprised
do
imagine
he
do
anything
more
but
i

xxvii
early
in
the
fall
the
baby

born
it
proved
to
be
a
boy
orde
nervous
as
a
cat
after
the
ordeal
of
doing
nothing
tiptoed
into
the
darkened
room
he
found
his
wife
weak
and
pale
her
dark
hair
framing
her
face
a
new
look
of
rapt
inner
contemplation
rendering
even
more
mysterious
her
always
fathomless
eyes
to
orde
she
seemed
fragile
aloof
enshrined
among
her
laces
and
dainty
ribbons
hardly
dared
he
touch
her
when
she
held
her
hand
out
to
him
weakly
but
fell
on
his
knees
beside
the
bed
and
buried
his
face
in
the
clothes
she
placed
a
gentle
hand
caressingly
on
his
head
so
they
remained
for
some
time
finally
he
raised
his
eyes
she
held
her
lips
to
him
he
kissed
them
seems
sort
of
even
yet
sweetheart
she
smiled
at
him
whimsically
we
have
a
real
live
baby
all
of
our
other
people
said
orde
like
other
people
at
all
she
disclaimed
with
a
show
of
indignation
grandma
orde
brought
the
newcomer
in
for
orde
inspection
he
looked
gravely
down
on
the
puckered
discoloured
bit
of
humanity
with
some
feeling
of
disappointment
and
perhaps
a
faint
uneasiness
after
a
moment
he
voiced
the
latter
do
you
think
that
is
he
hesitated
the
doctor
say
going
to
be
all
right
right
cried
grandma
orde
indignantly
like
to
know
if
he
is
all
right
now
what
in
the
world
do
you
expect
of
a
baby
but
carroll
was
laughing
softly
to
herself
on
the
bed
she
held
out
her
arms
for
the
baby
and
cuddled
it
close
to
her
breast
a
little
darling
she
crooned
he
going
to
grow
up
big
and
strong
just
like
his
she
put
her
cheek
against
the
sleeping
babe
and
looked
up
sidewise
at
the
two
standing
above
her
i
know
how
you
feel
she
said
to
her
husband
they
first
showed
him
to
me
i
thought
he
looked
like
a
peanut
a
thousand
years
grandma
orde
fairly
snorted
with
indignation
to
your
old
grandmother
who
appreciates
you
she
cried
possessing
herself
of
the
infant
a
beautiful
baby
one
of
the
babies
i
ever
saw

escaped
to
the
open
air
he
had
to
go
to
the
office
to
attend
to
some
details
of
the
business
with
every
step
his
elation
increased
at
the
office
he
threw
open
his
desk
with
a
slam
newmark
jumped
nervously
and
frowned
orde
big
open
and
brusque
manners
bothered
him
as
they
would
have
bothered
a
cat
a
son
and
heir
over
at
my
place
called
orde
in
his
big
voice
old
firm
got
to
rustle
now
i
tell
you
i
sure
said
newmark
rather
shortly
orde
is
doing
well
i
hope
fine
cried
orde
newmark
dropped
the
subject
and
plunged
into
a
business
matter
attention
however
was
flighty
after
a
little
while
he
closed
his
desk
with
another
bang
use
said
he
to
make
it
a
vacation
i
going
to
run
over
to
see
how
the
family
strangely
enough
the
young
couple
had
not
discussed
before
the
question
of
a
name
one
evening
at
twilight
when
orde
was
perched
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
carroll
brought
up
the
subject
ought
to
be
named
for
you
she
began
timidly
know
that
jack
and
i
love
to
have
another
jack
orde
in
the
family
but
dear
been
thinking
about
father
he
a
poor
forlorn
old
man
who
get
much
out
of
life
and
it
would
please
him
so
oh
more
than
you
can
imagine
such
a
thing
could
please
anybody
she
looked
up
at
him
doubtfully
orde
said
nothing
but
walked
around
the
bed
to
where
the
baby
lay
in
his
little
cradle
he
leaned
over
and
took
the
infant
up
in
his
gingerly
awkward
fashion
are
you
bobby

he
inquired
of
the
blinking
mite
xxviii
the
first
season
of
the
boom
company
was
most
successful
its
prospects
for
the
future
were
bright
the
drive
had
been
delivered
to
its
various
owners
at
a
price
below
what
it
had
cost
them
severally
and
without
the
necessary
attendant
bother
therefore
the
loggers
were
only
too
willing
to
renew
their
contracts
for
another
year
this
did
not
satisfy
newmark
however
we
want
he
told
orde
a
charter
giving
us
exclusive
rights
on
the
river
and
authorising
us
to
ask

and

departed
for
lansing
as
soon
as
the
assembly
opened
and
almost
immediately
became
lost
in
one
of
those
fierce
struggles
of
politics
not
less
bitter
because
concealed
heinzman
was
already
on
the
ground
newmark
had
the
shadow
of
right
on
his
side
for
he
applied
for
the
charter
on
the
basis
of
the
river
improvements
already
put
in
by
his
firm
heinzman
however
possessed
much
political
influence
a
deep
knowledge
of
the
subterranean
workings
of
plot
and
counterplot
and
a
although
armed
with
an
apparently
incontestable
legal
right
newmark
soon
found
himself
fighting
on
the
defensive
heinzman
wanted
the
improvements
already
existing
condemned
and
sold
as
a
public
utility
to
the
highest
bidder
he
offered
further
guarantees
as
to
future
improvements
in
addition
were
other
and
more
potent
arguments
proffered
behind
closed
doors
many
cases
resolved
themselves
into
a
bald
question
of
cash
others
demanded
diplomacy
jobs
fat
contracts
business
favours
influence
were
all
flung
out
freely
bribes
as
absolute
as
though
stamped
with
the
dollar
mark
newspapers
all
over
the
state
were
pressed
into
service
these
bought
up
by
heinzman
and
his
prospective
partners
in
a
lucrative
business
spoke
virtuously
of
private
piracy
of
what
are
now
called
public
utilities
the
exploiting
of
the
natural
wealths
and
all
the
rest
of
a
specious
reasoning
the
more
convincing
in
that
it
was
in
many
other
cases
only
too
true
the
independent
journals
uninformed
of
the
rights
of
the
case
either
remained
silent
on
the
matter
or
groped
in
a
puzzled
and
undecided
manner
on
both
sides
against
this
secret
but
effective
organisation
newmark
most
unexpectedly
found
himself
pitted
he
had
anticipated
being
absent
but
a
week
he
became
involved
in
an
affair
of
months
with
decision
he
applied
himself
to
the
problem
he
took
rooms
at
the
hotel
sent
for
orde
and
began
at
once
to
set
in
motion
the
machinery
of
opposition
the
refreshed
resources
of
the
company
were
strained
to
the
breaking
point
in
order
to
raise
money
for
this
new
campaign
opening
before
it
orde
returning
to
lansing
after
a
trip
devoted
to
the
carrying
out
of
newmark
directions
as
to
finances
was
dismayed
at
the
tangle
of
strategy
and
innuendo
vague
and
formless
cobweb
forces
by
which
he
was
surrounded
he
could
make
nothing
of
them
they
brushed
his
face
he
felt
their
influence
yet
he
could
place
his
finger
on
no
tangible
and
comprehensible
solidity
among
these
delicate
and
complicated
newmark
moved
silent
cold
secret
he
seemed
to
understand
them
to
play
with
them
to
manipulate
them
as
elements
of
the
game
above
them
was
the
hollow
shock
of
the
ostensible
battle
the
speeches
the
loud
talk
in
lobbies
the
newspaper
virtue
indignation
accusations
but
the
real
struggle
was
here
in
the
furtive
ways
in
whispered
words
delivered
hastily
aside
in
hotel
halls
on
the
way
to
and
from
the
stairs
behind
closed
doors
of
rooms
without
open
transoms
orde
in
comic
despair
acknowledged
that
it
was
all
deep
for
nevertheless
it
was
soon
borne
in
on
him
that
the
new
company
was
struggling
for
its
very
right
to
existence
it
had
been
doing
that
from
the
first
but
now
to
orde
the
fight
the
existence
had
a
new
importance
the
company
up
to
this
point
had
been
a
scheme
merely
an
experiment
that
might
win
or
lose
now
with
the
history
of
a
drive
behind
it
it
had
become
a
living
entity
orde
would
have
fought
against
its
dissolution
as
he
would
have
fought
against
a
murder
yet
he
had
practically
to
stand
one
side
watching
newmark
slender
tense
figure
gliding
here
and
there
more
silent
more
reserved
more
watchful
every
day
the
fight
endured
through
most
of
the
first
half
of
the
session
when
finally
it
became
evident
to
heinzman
that
newmark
would
win
he
made
the
issue
of
toll
rates
the
ditch
of
his
last
resistance
trying
to
force
legal
charges
so
low
as
to
eat
up
the
profits
at
the
last
however
the
bill
passed
the
board
the
company
had
its
charter
at
what
price
only
newmark
could
have
told
he
had
fought
with
the
tense
earnestness
of
the
nervous
temperament
that
fights
to
win
without
count
of
the
cost
the
firm
was
established
but
it
was
as
heavily
in
debt
as
its
credit
would
stand
newmark
himself
though
as
calm
and
reserved
and
precise
as
ever
seemed
to
have
turned
gray
and
one
of
his
eyelids
had
acquired
a
slight
nervous
twitch
which
persisted
for
some
months
he
took
his
seat
at
the
desk
however
as
calmly
as
ever
in
three
days
the
scandalised
howls
of
bribery
and
corruption
had
given
place
in
the
newspapers
to
some
other
sensation
said
orde
to
his
partner
about
all
this
talk
is
there
really
anything
in
it
you
have
gone
in
for
that
business
have
you
newmark
stretched
his
arms
wearily
bought
up
he
replied
know
for
a
fact
that
old
stanford
got
five
hundred
dollars
from
some
of
the
heinzman
interests
i
could
have
swung
him
back
for
an
extra
hundred
but
it
was
worth
while
they
howl
bribery
at
us
to
distract
attention
from
their
own
with
this
evasive
reply
orde
contented
himself
whether
it
satisfied
him
or
whether
he
was
loath
to
pursue
the
subject
further
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
cost
us
plenty
anyway
he
said
after
a
moment
proposition
got
a
load
on
it
it
will
take
us
a
long
time
to
get
out
of
debt
the
river
driving
wo
pay
quite
so
big
as
we
thought
it
would
he
concluded
with
a
rueful
little
laugh
will
pay
plenty
well
enough
replied
newmark
decidedly
it
gives
us
a
vantage
point
to
work
from
you
do
suppose
we
are
going
to
quit
at
river
driving
do
you
we
want
to
look
around
for
some
timber
of
our
own
there
where
the
big
money
is
and
perhaps
we
can
buy
a
schooner
or
two
and
go
into
the
carrying
trade
the
country
alive
with
opportunity
newmark
and
orde
means
something
to
these
fellows
now
we
can
have
anything
we
want
if
we
just
reach
out
for
his
thin
figure
ordinarily
slightly
askew
had
straightened
his
impersonal
eyes
had
lit
up
behind
the
bowed
glasses
and
were
seeing
things
beyond
the
wall
at
which
they
gazed
orde
looked
up
at
him
with
a
sudden
admiration
the
brains
of
this
concern
said
he
get
on
replied
newmark
the
fire
dying
from
his
eyes
xxix
in
the
course
of
the
next
eight
years
newmark
and
orde
floated
high
on
that
flood
of
apparent
prosperity
that
attends
a
business
well
conceived
and
passably
well
managed
the
boom
and
driving
company
made
money
of
course
for
with
the
margin
of
fifty
per
cent
or
thereabouts
necessitated
by
the
temporary
value
of
the
improvements
good
years
could
hardly
fail
to
bring
good
returns
this
it
will
be
remembered
was
a
stock
company
with
the
profits
from
that
business
the
two
men
embarked
on
a
separate
copartnership
they
made
money
at
this
too
but
the
burden
of
debt
necessitated
by
new
ventures
constantly
weighted
by
the
heavy
interest
demanded
at
that
time
kept
affairs
on
the
ragged
edge
in
addition
both
orde
and
newmark
were
more
inclined
to
extension
of
interests
than
to
the
assets
gained
in
one
venture
were
promptly
pledged
to
another
the
ramifications
of
debt
property
mortgages
and
expectations
overlapped
each
other
in
a
cobweb
of
interests
orde
lived
at
ease
in
a
new
house
of
some
size
surrounded
by
grounds
he
kept
two
servants
a
blooded
team
of
horses
drew
the
successor
to
the
original
buckboard
newmark
owned
a
sail
yacht
of
five
or
six
tons
in
which
quite
solitary
he
took
his
only
pleasure
both
were
considered
men
of
substance
and
property
as
indeed
they
were
only
they
risked
dollars
to
gain
thousands
a
succession
of
bad
years
a
of
money
markets
any
one
of
a
dozen
possible
though
not
probable
contingencies
would
render
it
difficult
to
meet
the
obligations
which
constantly
came
due
and
which
newmark
kept
busy
devising
ways
and
means
of
meeting
if
things
went
well
and
it
may
be
remarked
that
legitimately
they
should
newmark
and
orde
would
some
day
be
rated
among
the
millionaire
firms
if
things
went
ill
bankruptcy
could
not
be
avoided
there
was
no
middle
ground
nor
were
orde
and
his
partner
unique
in
this
practically
every
firm
then
developing
or
exploiting
the
natural
resources
of
the
country
found
itself
in
the
same
case
immediately
after
the
granting
of
the
charter
to
drive
the
river
the
partners
had
offered
them
an
opportunity
of
acquiring
about
thirty
million
feet
of
timber
remaining
from
morrison
and
daly
original
holdings
that
firm
was
very
anxious
to
begin
development
on
a
large
scale
of
its
beeson
lake
properties
in
the
saginaw
waters
daly
proposed
to
orde
that
he
take
over
the
remnant
and
having
confidence
in
the
young
man
abilities
agreed
to
let
him
have
it
on
notes
after
several
consultations
with
newmark
orde
finally
completed
the
purchase
below
the
booms
they
erected
a
mill
the
machinery
for
which
they
had
also
bought
of
daly
at
redding
the
following
winter
orde
spent
in
the
woods
by
spring
he
had
banked
ready
to
drive
about
six
million
feet
for
some
years
these
two
sorts
of
activity
gave
the
partners
about
all
they
could
attend
to
as
soon
as
the
drive
had
passed
redding
orde
left
it
in
charge
of
one
of
his
foremen
while
he
divided
his
time
between
the
booms
and
the
mill
late
in
the
year
his
woods
trips
began
the
tours
of
inspection
of
surveying
for
new
roads
the
inevitable
preparation
for
the
long
winter
campaigns
in
the
forest
as
soon
as
the
spring
thaws
began
once
more
the
drive
demanded
his
attention
and
in
marketing
the
lumber
manipulating
the
firm
financial
affairs
collecting
its
dues
paying
its
bills
making
its
purchases
and
keeping
oiled
the
intricate
bearing
points
of
its
office
machinery
newmark
was
busy
and
invaluable
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
year
the
opportunity
came
through
a
combination
of
a
bad
debt
and
a
man
death
to
get
possession
of
two
lake
schooners
orde
at
once
suggested
the
contract
for
a
steam
barge
towing
was
then
in
its
infancy
the
bulk
of
lake
traffic
was
by
means
of
individual
sailing
ships
a
method
uncertain
as
to
time
orde
thought
that
a
steam
barge
could
be
built
powerful
enough
not
only
to
carry
its
own
hold
and
deck
loads
but
to
tow
after
it
the
two
schooners
in
this
manner
the
crews
could
be
reduced
and
an
approximate
date
of
delivery
could
be
guaranteed
newmark
agreed
with
him
thus
the
firm
in
accordance
with
his
prophecy
went
into
the
carrying
trade
for
the
vessels
more
than
sufficed
for
its
own
needs
the
freighting
of
lumber
added
much
to
the
income
and
the
carrying
of
machinery
and
other
heavy
freight
on
the
return
trip
grew
every
year
but
by
far
the
most
important
acquisition
was
that
of
the
northern
peninsula
timber
most
operators
called
the
white
pine
along
and
back
from
the
river
inexhaustible
orde
did
not
believe
this
he
saw
the
time
not
far
distant
when
the
world
would
be
compelled
to
look
elsewhere
for
its
lumber
supply
and
he
turned
his
eyes
to
the
almost
unknown
north
after
a
long
investigation
through
agents
and
a
on
his
own
account
he
located
and
purchased
three
hundred
million
feet
this
was
to
be
paid
for
as
usual
mostly
by
the
notes
secured
by
its
other
property
it
would
become
available
only
in
the
future
but
orde
believed
as
indeed
the
event
justified
this
future
would
prove
to
be
not
so
distant
as
most
people
supposed
as
these
interests
widened
orde
became
more
and
more
immersed
in
them
he
was
forced
to
be
away
all
of
every
day
and
more
than
the
bulk
of
every
year
nevertheless
his
home
life
did
not
suffer
for
it
to
carroll
he
was
always
the
same
big
hearty
boy
she
had
first
learned
to
love
she
had
all
his
confidence
if
this
did
not
extend
into
business
affairs
it
was
because
orde
had
always
tried
to
get
away
from
them
when
at
home
at
first
carroll
had
attempted
to
keep
in
the
current
of
her
husband
activities
but
as
the
latter
broadened
in
scope
and
became
more
complex
she
perceived
that
their
explanation
wearied
him
she
grew
out
of
the
habit
of
asking
him
about
them
soon
their
rapid
advance
had
carried
them
quite
beyond
her
horizon
to
her
also
as
to
most
women
the
word
connoted
nothing
but
a
turmoil
and
a
mystery
in
all
other
things
they
were
to
each
other
what
they
had
been
from
the
first
no
more
children
had
come
to
them
bobby
however
had
turned
out
a
sturdy
honest
little
fellow
with
more
than
a
streak
of
his
charm
and
intuition
his
future
was
the
subject
of
all
orde
plans
want
to
give
him
all
the
chance
there
is
he
explained
to
carroll
boy
ought
to
start
where
his
father
left
off
and
not
have
to
do
the
same
thing
all
over
again
but
being
a
rich
man
son
is
much
of
a
do
you
let
him
continue
your
business
smiled
carroll
secretly
amused
at
the
idea
of
the
small
person
before
them
ever
doing
anything
the
time
bobby
grown
up
this
business
will
all
be
closed
out
replied
orde
seriously
he
continued
to
look
at
his
minute
son
with
puckered
brow
until
carroll
smoothed
out
the
wrinkles
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
course
having
only
a
few
minutes
to
decide
she
mocked
we
better
make
up
our
minds
right
now
to
have
him
a
agreed
bobby
unexpectedly
and
with
emphasis
three
years
after
this
conversation
which
would
have
made
bobby
just
eight
orde
came
back
before
six
of
a
summer
evening
his
face
alight
with
satisfaction
bub
he
cried
to
bobby
tossing
him
to
his
shoulder
the
kid
they
went
out
together
while
awaiting
dinner
to
see
the
new
setter
puppy
in
the
woodshed
him
yet
asked
orde
said
bobby
orde
surveyed
the
animal
gravely
like
a
good
name
said
he
after
dinner
the
two
adjourned
to
the
library
where
they
sat
together
in
the
chair
and
bobby
squirmed
a
little
sidewise
in
order
the
better
to
see
watched
the
smoke
from
his
father
cigar
as
it
eddied
and
curled
in
the
air
a
story
he
commanded
finally
acquiesced
orde
was
once
a
man
who
had
a
cow
upon
a
time
corrected
bobby
he
listened
for
a
moment
or
so
do
like
that
story
he
then
announced
the
story
about
the
this
is
a
new
story
protested
orde
you
heard
about
the
bears
so
many
insisted
bobby
once
upon
a
time
there
were
three
bears
a
big
bear
and
a
bear
and
a
little
bear
began
orde
obediently
bobby
with
a
sigh
of
rapture
and
content
curled
up
in
a
snug
warm
little
ball
the
twilight
darkened
holiday
warned
carroll
behind
them
so
suddenly
that
they
both
jumped
the
sand
man
been
at
somebody
i
know
she
bore
him
away
to
bed
orde
sat
smoking
in
the
darkness
staring
straight
ahead
of
him
into
the
future
he
believed
he
had
found
the
opportunity
twenty
years
distant
for
which
he
had
been
looking
so
long
xxx
after
a
time
carroll
descended
the
stairs
chuckling
she
called
into
the
out
on
the
porch
what
do
you
suppose
the
young
man
did
it
up
replied
orde
promptly
good
guessing
when
it
a
question
of
that
youngster
performances
what
was
it
said
his
i
lay
me
and
asked
blessings
on
you
and
me
and
the
grandpas
and
grandmas
and
auntie
kate
as
usual
then
he
stopped
else
i
reminded
him
he
finished
with
a
rush
they
laughed
delightedly
over
this
clinging
together
like
two
children
then
they
stepped
out
on
the
little
porch
and
looked
into
the
fathomless
night
the
sky
was
full
of
stars
aloof
and
calm
but
waiting
breathless
on
the
edge
of
action
attending
the
word
of
command
or
the
celestial
vision
or
whatever
it
is
for
which
stars
seem
to
wait
along
the
street
the
dense
velvet
shade
of
the
maples
threw
the
sidewalks
into
impenetrable
blackness
sounds
carried
clearly
from
the
welton
down
the
street
came
the
tinkle
of
a
mandolin
and
an
occasional
low
laugh
from
the
group
of
young
people
that
nightly
frequented
the
front
steps
tree
toads
chirped
in
unison
or
fell
abruptly
silent
as
though
by
signal
all
up
and
down
the
rows
of
houses
whirred
the
low
monotone
of
the
lawn
sprinklers
and
the
aroma
of
their
wetness
was
borne
cool
and
refreshing
through
the
tepid
air
orde
and
his
wife
sat
together
on
the
top
step
he
slipped
his
arm
about
her
they
said
nothing
but
breathed
deep
of
the
quiet
happiness
that
filled
their
lives
the
gate
latch
clicked
and
two
shadowy
figures
defined
themselves
approaching
up
the
concrete
walk
called
orde
cheerfully
into
the
darkness
a
man
voice
instantly
responded
and
clara
said
orde
to
carroll
with
satisfaction
the
man
i
wanted
to
the
lawyer
and
his
wife
mounted
the
steps
he
was
a
quick
energetic
spare
man
with
lean
cheeks
a
bristling
clipped
moustache
and
a
slight
stoop
to
his
shoulders
she
was
small
piquant
almost
with
a
dainty
nose
a
large
and
lustrous
eye
a
constant
animation
of
manner
the
folly
of
artists
the
adorable
lovable
harmless
folly
standing
tiptoe
on
a
complaisant
world
the
man
i
wanted
to
see
repeated
orde
as
the
two
approached
clara
taylor
stopped
short
and
considered
him
for
a
moment
us
away
she
said
seriously
to
carroll
prophetic
soul
tells
me
they
are
going
to
talk
business
and
if
any
more
business
is
talked
in
my
presence
i
shall
expire
both
men
laughed
but
orde
explained
apologetically
you
know
taylor
these
are
my
especially
busy
days
for
the
firm
and
i
have
to
work
my
private
affairs
in
when
i
thought
frank
was
very
solicitous
about
my
getting
out
in
the
air
cried
clara
carroll
let
wander
down
the
street
and
see
mina
the
two
interlocked
arms
and
sauntered
along
the
walk
both
men
lit
cigars
and
sat
on
the
top
step
of
the
porch
here
taylor
broke
in
orde
abruptly
told
me
the
other
day
you
had
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
you
wanted
to
place
replied
taylor
i
believe
i
have
just
the
is
it
pine
replied
orde
pine
repeated
taylor
after
a
slight
pause
california
that
a
long
way
off
and
there
no
market
is
there
why
way
out
there
cheap
replied
orde
succinctly
do
say
it
will
be
good
for
immediate
returns
nor
even
for
returns
in
the
near
future
but
in
twenty
or
thirty
years
it
ought
to
pay
big
on
a
small
investment
made
taylor
shook
his
head
doubtfully
do
see
how
you
figure
it
he
objected
have
more
timber
than
we
can
use
in
the
east
why
should
we
go
several
thousand
miles
west
for
the
same
thing
our
timber
gives
out
then
we
have
to
go
west
said
orde
taylor
laughed
all
you
please
rejoined
orde
i
tell
you
michigan
and
wisconsin
pine
is
doomed
twenty
or
thirty
years
from
now
there
wo
be
any
white
pine
for
objected
taylor
talking
wild
we
have
even
begun
on
the
upper
peninsula
after
that
there
minnesota
and
i
observed
that
we
quite
out
of
timber
on
the
river
or
the
muskegon
or
the
saginaw
or
the
grand
or
the
cheboygan
why
great
scott
man
our
children
children
children
may
be
thinking
of
investing
in
california
timber
but
that
about
soon
tight
said
orde
quietly
what
do
you
think
of
indiana
as
a
good
field
for
timber
investment
cried
taylor
amazed
there
no
timber
there
it
a
used
to
be
and
all
the
southern
michigan
farm
belt
was
timbered
and
around
here
we
have
our
stumps
to
show
for
it
but
there
are
no
evidences
at
all
farther
south
you
have
hard
work
for
instance
to
persuade
a
stranger
that
van
buren
county
was
once
it
asked
taylor
doubtfully
was
you
take
your
map
and
see
how
much
area
has
been
cut
already
and
how
much
remains
that
open
your
eyes
and
remember
all
that
has
been
done
by
crude
methods
for
a
relatively
small
demand
the
demand
increases
as
the
country
grows
and
methods
improve
it
would
not
surprise
me
if
some
day
thirty
or
forty
millions
would
constitute
an
average
cut
pine
exhaustless
those
fellows
make
me
sick
at
the
present
day
some
firms
cut
as
high
as
feet
a
little
more
reasonable
said
taylor
slowly
sound
a
lot
more
reasonable
in
five
or
ten
years
insisted
orde
then
you
see
the
big
men
rushing
out
into
that
oregon
and
california
country
but
now
a
man
can
get
practically
the
pick
of
the
coast
there
are
only
a
few
big
concerns
out
is
it
that
no
one
orde
cut
him
short
big
things
are
for
the
fellow
who
can
see
far
enough
kind
of
a
proposition
have
you
asked
taylor
after
a
pause
can
get
ten
thousand
acres
at
an
average
price
of
eight
dollars
an
acre
replied
orde
what
does
that
mean
in
timber
this
particular
tract
it
means
about
four
hundred
million
about
twenty
cents
a
orde
nodded
of
course
you
could
operate
for
a
long
time
for
twenty
maybe
thirty
years
replied
orde
calmly
your
interest
on
your
money
and
taxes
and
the
risk
of
fire
and
course
of
course
agreed
orde
impatiently
you
getting
your
stumpage
for
twenty
cents
or
a
little
more
and
in
thirty
years
it
will
be
worth
as
high
as
a
dollar
and
a
at
the
present
time
sugar
pine
such
as
orde
described
would
cost
to
cried
taylor
is
my
opinion
said
orde
taylor
relapsed
into
thought
here
orde
he
broke
out
finally
old
are
you
why
much
timber
have
you
in
michigan
ten
million
that
we
picked
up
on
the
river
since
the
daly
purchase
and
three
hundred
million
in
the
northern
will
take
you
twenty
years
to
cut
and
make
you
a
million
dollars
or
so
why
this
investment
thirty
years
ahead
for
bobby
explained
orde
simply
man
likes
to
have
his
son
continue
on
in
his
business
i
ca
do
it
here
but
there
i
can
it
would
take
fifty
years
to
cut
that
pine
and
that
will
give
bobby
a
steady
income
and
a
steady
will
be
well
enough
off
anyway
he
wo
have
to
go
into
orde
brow
puckered
know
a
man
bobby
is
going
to
work
a
man
is
not
a
success
in
life
unless
he
does
something
and
bobby
is
going
to
be
a
success
why
taylor
he
chuckled
little
rascal
fills
the
for
a
cent
a
time
and
that
all
the
he
gets
he
saving
now
to
buy
a
boat
i
agreed
to
pool
in
half
at
his
present
rate
of
income
i
safe
for
about
sixty
years
soon
are
you
going
to
close
this
deal
asked
taylor
rising
as
he
caught
sight
of
two
figures
coming
up
the
walk
have
an
option
until
november
replied
orde
you
ca
make
it
i
guess
i
can
swing
it
myself
by
the
way
keep
this
taylor
nodded
and
the
two
turned
to
defend
themselves
as
best
they
could
against
clara
laughing
attack
xxxi
orde
had
said
nothing
to
newmark
concerning
this
purposed
new
investment
nor
did
he
intend
doing
so
is
for
bobby
he
told
himself
i
want
bobby
and
no
one
else
to
run
it
joe
would
want
to
take
charge
naturally
taylor
wo
he
knows
nothing
of
the
he
walked
downtown
next
morning
busily
formulating
his
scheme
at
the
office
he
found
newmark
already
seated
at
his
desk
a
pile
of
letters
in
front
of
him
upon
orde
boisterous
greeting
his
nerves
crisped
slightly
but
of
this
there
was
no
outward
sign
beyond
a
tightening
of
his
hands
on
the
letter
he
was
reading
behind
his
his
blue
cynical
eyes
twinkled
like
frost
crystals
as
always
he
was
immaculately
dressed
in
neat
gray
clothes
and
carried
in
one
corner
of
his
mouth
an
unlighted
cigar
said
orde
spinning
a
chair
to
newmark
desk
and
speaking
in
a
low
tone
how
do
we
stand
on
that
upper
peninsula
stumpage
do
you
mean
how
much
of
it
is
there
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
about
three
hundred
i
mean
made
two
payments
of
thousand
each
and
have
still
two
to
make
of
the
same
could
we
borrow
on
it
do
want
to
borrow
anything
on
it
returned
newmark
in
a
flash
not
but
if
we
should
might
raise
fifty
or
thousand
i
said
orde
want
to
raise
about
thousand
dollars
on
my
share
in
this
concern
if
it
can
be
up
inquired
newmark
keenly
a
private
newmark
said
nothing
but
for
some
time
thought
busily
his
light
blue
eyes
narrowed
to
a
slit
have
to
figure
on
it
a
while
said
he
at
last
and
turned
back
to
his
mail
all
day
he
worked
hard
with
only
a
intermission
for
a
lunch
which
was
brought
up
from
the
hotel
below
at
six
he
slammed
shut
the
desk
he
descended
the
stairs
with
orde
from
whom
he
parted
at
their
foot
and
walked
precisely
away
his
tall
thin
figure
held
rigid
and
slightly
askew
his
pale
eyes
slitted
behind
his
the
unlighted
cigar
in
one
corner
of
his
straight
lips
to
the
occasional
passerby
he
bowed
coldly
and
with
formality
at
the
corner
below
he
bore
to
the
left
and
after
a
short
walk
entered
the
small
house
set
well
back
from
the
sidewalk
among
the
clumps
of
oleanders
here
he
turned
into
a
study
quietly
and
richly
furnished
ten
years
in
advance
of
the
taste
then
prevalent
in
monrovia
where
he
sank
into
a
chair
and
lit
the
cigar
for
some
moments
he
lay
back
with
his
eyes
shut
then
he
opened
them
to
look
with
approval
on
the
dark
walnut
the
framed
prints
and
etchings
the
bronzed
student
lamp
on
the
square
table
desk
the
rugs
on
the
polished
floor
he
picked
up
a
magazine
into
which
he
dipped
for
ten
minutes
the
door
opened
noiselessly
behind
him
newmark
sir
came
a
respectful
voice
is
just
short
of
well
replied
newmark
without
looking
around
the
man
withdrew
as
softly
as
he
had
come
after
a
moment
newmark
replaced
the
magazine
on
the
table
yawned
threw
aside
the
cigar
of
which
he
had
smoked
but
an
inch
and
passed
from
his
study
into
his
bedroom
across
the
hall
this
contained
an
exquisite
colonial
with
a
lowboy
and
dresser
to
match
and
was
papered
and
carpeted
in
accordance
with
these
its
chief
ornaments
newmark
bathed
in
the
adjoining
bathroom
shaved
carefully
between
the
two
wax
lights
which
were
his
whim
and
dressed
in
what
were
then
known
as
clothes
probably
he
was
the
only
man
in
monrovia
at
that
moment
so
apparelled
then
calmly
and
with
all
the
deliberation
of
one
under
fire
of
a
hundred
eyes
he
proceeded
to
the
where
waited
the
man
who
had
a
short
time
before
reminded
him
of
the
hour
he
was
a
solemn
dignified
man
whose
like
was
not
to
be
found
elsewhere
this
side
the
city
he
too
wore
the
but
its
buttons
were
of
gilt
newmark
seated
himself
in
a
mahogany
chair
before
a
small
round
mahogany
table
the
room
was
illuminated
only
by
four
wax
candles
with
red
shades
they
threw
into
relief
the
polish
of
mahogany
the
glitter
of
glass
the
shine
of
silver
but
into
darkness
the
detail
of
massive
sideboard
dull
panelling
and
the
two
or
three
sporting
prints
on
the
wall
may
serve
dinner
mallock
said
newmark
he
ate
deliberately
and
with
enjoyment
the
meal
exquisitely
prepared
and
exquisitely
presented
to
him
with
it
he
drank
a
single
glass
of
burgundy
a
deed
that
would
in
the
eyes
of
monrovia
have
condemned
him
as
certainly
as
driving
a
horse
on
sunday
or
playing
cards
for
a
stake
afterward
he
returned
to
the
study
whither
mallock
brought
coffee
he
lit
another
cigar
opened
a
drawer
in
his
desk
extracted
therefrom
some
and
small
personal
account
books
from
these
he
figured
all
the
evening
his
cigar
went
out
but
he
did
not
notice
that
and
chewed
away
quite
contentedly
on
the
dead
butt
when
he
had
finished
his
cold
eye
exhibited
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
he
had
resolved
on
a
course
of
action
at
ten
he
went
to
bed
next
morning
mallock
closed
the
door
behind
him
promptly
upon
the
stroke
of
eight
it
was
strange
that
not
one
living
soul
but
mallock
had
ever
entered
newmark
abode
curiosity
had
at
first
brought
a
few
callers
but
these
were
always
met
by
the
imperturbable
servant
with
so
plausible
a
reason
for
his
master
absence
that
the
visitors
had
departed
without
a
suspicion
that
they
had
been
deliberately
excluded
and
as
newmark
made
no
friends
and
excited
little
interest
the
attempts
to
cultivate
him
gradually
ceased
said
newmark
as
the
former
entered
the
office
think
i
can
arrange
this
orde
drew
up
a
chair
talked
last
evening
with
a
man
from
detroit
named
thayer
who
thinks
he
may
advance
thousand
dollars
on
a
mortgage
on
our
northern
peninsula
stumpage
for
that
of
course
we
will
give
the
firm
note
with
interest
at
ten
per
cent
i
will
turn
this
over
to
began
orde
on
interrupted
newmark
collateral
security
you
will
deposit
for
me
your
stock
in
the
boom
company
indorsed
in
blank
if
you
do
not
pay
the
full
amount
of
the
firm
note
to
thayer
then
the
stock
will
be
turned
in
to
see
said
orde
do
misunderstand
me
said
newmark
drily
is
your
own
affair
and
i
do
not
urge
it
on
you
if
we
raise
as
much
as
thousand
dollars
on
that
upper
peninsula
stumpage
it
will
be
all
it
can
stand
for
next
year
we
must
make
a
third
payment
on
it
if
you
take
that
money
it
is
of
course
proper
that
you
pay
the
interest
on
said
orde
if
there
any
possibility
of
the
foreclosure
of
the
mortgage
it
is
only
right
that
you
run
all
the
risk
of
loss
not
repeated
orde
another
point
of
view
went
on
newmark
are
practically
mortgaging
your
interest
in
the
boom
company
for
thousand
dollars
that
would
make
on
the
usual
basis
of
a
mortgage
your
share
worth
above
two
hundred
thousand
and
four
hundred
thousand
is
a
high
valuation
of
our
looks
more
than
decent
on
your
part
said
orde
course
it
none
of
my
business
what
you
intend
to
do
with
this
went
on
newmark
unless
you
sure
you
can
meet
these
notes
i
should
strongly
advise
against
same
remark
applies
to
any
mortgage
rejoined
orde
how
long
a
time
could
i
get
this
asked
orde
at
length
could
promise
it
for
longer
than
five
years
replied
newmark
would
make
about
fifteen
thousand
a
year
and
interest
well
i
do
see
why
i
ca
carry
that
easily
on
our
present
showing
and
nothing
untoward
happens
insisted
newmark
determined
to
put
forward
all
objections
possible
not
much
risk
said
orde
hopefully
nothing
surer
than
lumber
we
pay
the
notes
easily
enough
as
we
cut
and
the
boom
company
on
velvet
now
what
do
our
earnings
figure
anyway
driving
one
hundred
and
fifty
million
at
a
profit
of
about
sixty
cents
a
thousand
said
newmark
ninety
thousand
dollars
in
five
years
four
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
said
orde
sucking
his
pencil
ought
to
clean
up
five
dollars
a
thousand
on
our
about
a
hundred
thousand
on
what
we
got
that
little
barge
business
nets
us
about
twelve
or
fifteen
thousand
a
the
five
years
about
sixty
thousand
more
let
see
that
a
total
of
say
six
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
five
will
have
to
take
up
in
that
time
said
newmark
who
seemed
to
have
the
statistics
at
his
two
payments
on
our
timber
the
note
on
the
first
national
the
commercial
note
the
remaining
liabilities
on
the
boom
company
about
three
hundred
thousand
all
told
counting
the
orde
crumpled
the
paper
and
threw
it
into
the
waste
basket
said
he
enough
i
ought
to
get
along
on
a
margin
like
he
went
over
to
his
own
desk
where
he
again
set
to
figuring
on
his
pad
the
results
he
eyed
a
little
doubtfully
each
year
he
must
pay
in
interest
the
sum
of
seven
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
each
year
he
would
have
to
count
on
a
proportionate
saving
of
fifteen
thousand
dollars
toward
payment
of
the
notes
in
addition
he
must
live
orde
family
is
going
to
be
mighty
hard
up
said
he
whistling
humorously
but
orde
was
by
nature
and
training
sanguine
and
fond
of
big
risks
mind
it
for
bobby
said
he
to
himself
maybe
the
rate
of
interest
will
go
down
and
i
be
able
to
borrow
on
the
california
tract
if
anything
does
go
he
put
on
his
hat
thrust
a
bundle
of
papers
into
his
pocket
and
stepped
across
the
hall
into
taylor
office
the
lawyer
he
found
tipped
back
in
his
revolving
chair
reading
a
printed
brief
began
orde
immediately
came
to
see
you
about
that
california
timber
taylor
laid
down
the
brief
and
removed
his
with
which
he
began
immediately
to
tap
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
down
jack
said
he
glad
you
came
in
i
was
going
to
try
to
see
you
some
time
i
been
thinking
the
matter
over
very
carefully
since
the
other
day
and
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
too
steep
for
me
i
do
doubt
the
investment
a
bit
but
the
returns
are
too
far
off
fifteen
thousand
means
a
lot
more
to
me
than
it
does
to
you
and
i
got
to
think
of
the
immediate
future
i
hope
you
counting
on
me
that
all
right
broke
in
orde
i
told
you
i
can
swing
the
thing
myself
and
only
mentioned
it
to
you
on
the
off
chance
you
might
want
to
invest
now
what
i
want
is
this
he
proceeded
to
outline
carefully
the
agreement
between
himself
and
newmark
while
the
lawyer
took
notes
and
occasionally
interjected
a
question
right
said
the
latter
when
the
details
had
been
mastered
draw
the
necessary
notes
and
went
on
orde
producing
the
bundle
of
papers
from
his
pocket
the
abstract
of
title
i
wish
you
look
it
over
it
a
long
one
but
not
complicated
as
near
as
i
can
make
out
trace
seems
to
have
acquired
this
tract
mostly
from
the
original
homesteaders
and
the
like
who
of
course
take
title
direct
from
the
government
but
naturally
there
are
a
heap
of
them
and
i
want
you
to
look
it
over
to
be
sure
everything
right
agreed
taylor
reaching
for
the
papers
other
thing
concluded
orde
uncrossing
his
legs
want
this
investment
to
get
no
further
than
the
office
door
you
see
this
is
for
bobby
and
i
given
a
lot
of
thought
to
that
sort
of
thing
and
nothing
spoils
a
man
sooner
than
to
imagine
the
thing
all
cut
and
dried
for
him
and
nothing
keeps
him
going
like
the
thought
that
got
to
rustle
his
own
opportunities
you
and
i
know
that
going
to
have
the
best
education
possible
he
going
to
learn
to
be
a
lumberman
by
practical
experience
and
that
practical
experience
get
with
other
people
no
working
for
his
dad
in
bobby
i
can
tell
you
when
he
gets
through
college
i
get
him
a
little
job
clerking
with
some
good
firm
and
he
have
a
chance
to
show
what
is
in
him
and
to
learn
the
business
from
the
ground
up
the
way
a
man
ought
to
of
course
i
make
arrangements
that
he
has
a
real
chance
then
when
he
worked
into
the
harness
a
little
the
old
man
will
take
him
out
and
show
him
the
fine
big
sugar
pine
and
say
to
him
my
boy
your
opportunity
and
you
earned
it
how
does
orde
and
son
sound
to
you
what
do
you
think
of
it
frank
taylor
nodded
several
times
believe
you
on
the
right
track
and
i
help
you
all
i
can
said
he
briefly
of
course
i
want
to
keep
the
thing
dead
secret
continued
orde
the
only
man
who
knows
anything
about
it
i
not
even
going
to
buy
directly
under
my
own
name
i
going
to
incorporate
myself
he
said
with
a
grin
know
how
those
things
will
get
out
and
how
they
always
get
back
to
the
wrong
on
me
taylor
assured
him
as
orde
walked
home
that
evening
after
a
hot
day
his
mind
was
full
of
speculation
as
to
the
immediate
future
he
had
a
local
reputation
for
wealth
and
no
one
knew
better
than
himself
how
important
it
is
for
a
man
in
debt
to
keep
up
appearances
nevertheless
decided
retrenchment
would
be
necessary
after
bobby
had
gone
to
bed
he
explained
this
to
his
wife
the
matter
she
asked
quickly
the
firm
losing
money
replied
orde
a
matter
of
he
hesitated
a
dead
secret
which
i
do
want
to
get
out
but
i
thinking
of
buying
some
western
timber
for
bobby
when
he
grows
carroll
laughed
softly
so
relieve
my
mind
she
smiled
at
him
was
afraid
you
decided
on
the
idea
why
sweetheart
you
know
perfectly
well
we
could
go
back
to
the
little
house
next
the
church
and
be
as
happy
as
xxxii
in
the
meantime
newmark
had
closed
his
desk
picked
his
hat
from
the
nail
and
marched
precisely
down
the
street
to
heinzman
office
he
found
the
little
german
in
newmark
demanded
a
private
interview
and
without
preliminary
plunged
into
the
business
that
had
brought
him
he
had
long
since
taken
heinzman
measure
as
indeed
he
had
taken
the
measure
of
every
other
man
with
whom
he
did
or
was
likely
to
do
business
said
he
abruptly
partner
wants
to
raise
thousand
dollars
for
his
personal
use
i
have
agreed
to
get
him
that
money
from
the
heinzman
sat
immovable
his
round
eyes
blinking
behind
his
big
spectacles
said
he
shrewdly
security
in
case
he
can
not
pay
the
notes
the
firm
will
have
to
give
he
has
signed
an
agreement
to
turn
over
to
me
his
undivided
interest
in
our
you
vant
to
borrow
dot
money
of
me
asked
heinzman
could
not
raise
know
that
perfectly
well
replied
newmark
coolly
are
going
to
have
difficulty
meeting
your
july
notes
as
it
heinzman
hardly
seemed
to
breathe
but
a
flicker
of
red
blazed
in
his
eye
he
repeated
after
a
moment
intend
went
on
newmark
furnish
this
money
myself
it
must
however
seem
to
be
loaned
by
another
i
want
you
to
lend
this
money
on
for
asked
heinzman
a
one
tenth
of
orde
share
in
case
he
does
not
meet
those
he
vill
meet
the
notes
objected
heinzman
are
a
prosperous
concern
i
know
somethings
of
your
business
thinks
he
will
rejoined
newmark
grimly
will
merely
point
out
to
you
that
his
entire
income
is
from
the
firm
and
that
from
this
income
he
must
save
thousand
a
year
the
firm
has
hard
luck
said
heinzman
finished
newmark
you
come
to
me
demanded
heinzman
at
length
i
offering
you
a
chance
to
get
even
with
orde
i
do
imagine
you
love
him
de
matter
mit
my
gettin
efen
with
you
too
cried
heinzman
you
beat
me
out
at
lansing
newmark
smiled
coldly
under
his
clipped
moustache
offering
you
the
chance
of
making
anywhere
from
thirty
to
fifty
thousand
and
suppose
this
liddle
scheme
do
work
out
pursued
newmark
calmly
carry
you
over
in
your
present
he
suddenly
hit
the
arm
of
his
chair
with
his
clenched
fist
if
you
do
make
those
july
payments
what
to
become
of
you
where
your
timber
and
your
mills
and
your
new
house
and
that
pretty
daughter
of
yours
heinzman
winced
visibly
vill
get
an
extension
of
time
said
he
feebly
you
countered
newmark
the
two
men
looked
each
other
in
the
eye
for
a
moment
maybe
laughed
heinzman
uneasily
looks
to
me
like
a
right
then
said
newmark
briskly
make
out
a
mortgage
at
ten
per
cent
for
you
and
you
lend
the
money
on
it
at
the
proper
time
if
things
happen
that
way
you
will
foreclose
that
all
you
have
to
do
with
it
then
when
the
timber
land
comes
to
you
under
the
foreclose
you
will
reconvey
an
undivided
interest
for
proper
consideration
of
course
and
without
recording
the
heinzman
laughed
with
assumed
lightness
i
fool
you
said
he
guess
i
joost
keep
it
for
newmark
looked
at
him
coldly
would
he
advised
may
remember
the
member
from
lapeer
county
in
that
charter
fight
and
the
five
hundred
dollars
for
his
vote
try
it
on
and
see
how
much
evidence
i
can
bring
up
it
called
bribery
in
this
state
and
means
penitentiary
do
take
a
joke
complained
heinzman
newmark
arose
understood
then
he
asked
so
i
know
you
play
fair
asked
the
german
do
it
a
case
where
we
have
to
depend
more
or
less
on
each
other
but
i
do
see
what
you
stand
to
lose
and
anyway
you
get
carried
over
those
july
payments
newmark
reminded
him
heinzman
was
plainly
uneasy
and
slightly
afraid
of
these
new
waters
in
which
he
swam
you
reduce
the
firm
profits
he
iss
going
to
suspect
he
admonished
said
anything
about
reducing
the
firm
profits
said
newmark
impatiently
it
does
work
out
that
way
we
win
a
big
thing
if
it
does
not
we
lose
he
nodded
to
heinzman
and
left
the
office
his
demeanour
was
as
dry
and
precise
as
ever
no
expression
illuminated
his
impassive
countenance
if
he
felt
the
slightest
uneasiness
over
having
practically
delivered
his
intentions
to
the
keeping
of
another
he
did
not
show
it
for
one
thing
an
accomplice
was
absolutely
essential
and
too
he
held
the
german
by
his
strongest
passions
his
avarice
his
dread
of
bankruptcy
his
pride
and
his
fear
of
the
penitentiary
as
he
entered
the
office
of
his
own
firm
his
eye
fell
on
orde
bulky
form
seated
at
the
desk
he
paused
involuntarily
and
a
slight
shiver
shook
his
frame
from
head
to
foot
the
dainty
instinctive
repulsion
of
a
cat
for
a
large
robustious
dog
instantly
controlling
himself
he
stepped
forward
made
the
loan
he
announced
orde
looked
up
with
interest
banks
would
touch
northern
peninsula
said
newmark
steadily
i
had
to
go
to
private
you
said
do
care
who
deals
it
out
laughed
orde
backed
out
so
finally
i
got
the
whole
amount
from
heinzman
newmark
announced
know
the
old
dutchman
was
that
well
off
said
orde
after
a
slight
pause
tell
about
those
secretive
old
fellows
said
newmark
orde
hesitated
did
know
he
was
friendly
enough
to
lend
us
is
business
replied
newmark
xxxiii
there
exists
the
legend
of
an
eastern
despot
who
wishing
to
rid
himself
of
a
courtier
armed
the
man
and
shut
him
in
a
dark
room
the
victim
knew
he
was
to
fight
something
but
whence
it
was
to
come
when
or
of
what
nature
he
was
unable
to
guess
in
the
event
while
groping
tense
for
an
enemy
he
fell
under
the
fatal
fumes
of
noxious
gases
from
the
moment
orde
completed
the
secret
purchase
of
the
california
timber
lands
from
trace
he
became
an
unwitting
participant
in
one
of
the
strangest
duels
known
to
business
history
newmark
opposed
to
him
all
the
subtleties
all
the
ruses
and
expedients
to
which
his
position
lent
itself
orde
sublimely
unconscious
deployed
the
magnificent
resources
of
strength
energy
organisation
and
combative
spirit
that
animated
his
pioneer
soul
the
occult
manoeuverings
of
newmark
called
out
fresh
exertions
on
the
part
of
orde
newmark
worked
under
this
disadvantage
he
had
carefully
to
avoid
the
slightest
appearance
of
an
attitude
inimical
to
the
firm
very
best
prosperity
a
breath
of
suspicion
would
destroy
his
plans
if
the
smallest
untoward
incident
should
ever
bring
it
clearly
before
orde
that
newmark
might
have
an
interest
in
reducing
profits
he
could
not
fail
to
tread
out
the
logic
of
the
latter
devious
ways
for
this
reason
newmark
could
not
as
yet
fight
even
in
the
twilight
he
did
not
dare
make
bad
sales
awkward
transactions
in
spite
of
his
best
efforts
he
could
not
succeed
without
the
aid
of
chance
in
striking
a
blow
from
which
orde
could
not
recover
the
profits
of
the
first
year
were
not
quite
up
to
the
usual
standard
but
they
sufficed
newmark
finesse
cut
in
two
the
firm
income
of
the
second
year
orde
roused
himself
with
his
energy
of
resource
he
hurried
the
woods
work
until
an
especially
big
cut
gave
promise
of
recouping
the
losses
of
the
year
before
newmark
found
himself
struggling
against
a
force
greater
than
he
had
imagined
it
to
be
blinded
and
bound
it
nevertheless
made
head
against
his
policy
newmark
was
forced
to
a
temporary
quiescence
he
held
himself
watchful
intent
awaiting
the
opportunity
which
chance
should
bring
chance
seemed
by
no
means
in
haste
the
end
of
the
fourth
year
found
newmark
puzzled
orde
had
paid
regularly
the
interest
on
his
notes
how
much
he
had
been
able
to
save
toward
the
redemption
of
the
notes
themselves
his
partner
was
unable
to
decide
it
depended
entirely
on
how
much
the
ordes
had
disbursed
in
living
expenses
whether
or
not
orde
had
any
private
debts
and
whether
or
not
he
had
private
resources
in
the
meantime
newmark
contented
himself
with
tying
up
the
firm
assets
in
such
a
manner
as
to
render
it
impossible
to
raise
money
on
its
property
when
the
time
should
come
what
orde
regarded
as
a
series
of
petty
annoyances
had
made
the
problem
of
paying
for
the
california
timber
a
matter
of
greater
difficulty
than
he
had
supposed
it
would
be
a
pressure
whose
points
of
support
he
could
not
place
was
closing
slowly
on
him
against
this
pressure
he
exerted
himself
it
made
him
a
trifle
uneasy
but
it
did
not
worry
him
the
margin
of
safety
was
not
as
broad
as
he
had
reckoned
but
it
existed
and
in
any
case
if
worse
came
to
worst
he
could
always
mortgage
the
california
timber
for
enough
to
make
up
the
difference
and
more
against
this
expedient
however
he
opposed
a
sentimental
obstinacy
it
was
bobby
and
he
objected
to
encumbering
it
in
fact
orde
was
capable
of
a
prolonged
and
bitter
struggle
to
avoid
doing
so
nevertheless
it
was
there
an
asset
a
loan
on
its
security
would
with
what
he
had
set
aside
more
than
pay
the
notes
on
the
northern
peninsula
stumpage
orde
felt
perfectly
easy
in
his
mind
he
was
in
the
position
of
many
of
our
rich
men
sons
who
quite
sincerely
and
earnestly
go
penniless
to
the
city
to
make
their
way
they
live
on
their
nine
dollars
a
week
and
go
hungry
when
they
lose
their
jobs
they
stand
on
their
own
feet
and
yet
in
case
of
severe
illness
or
actual
starvation
the
old
man
is
there
it
gives
them
a
courage
to
be
contented
on
nothing
so
orde
would
have
gone
to
almost
any
lengths
to
keep
free
tract
but
it
stood
always
between
himself
and
disaster
and
a
loan
on
western
timber
could
be
paid
off
just
as
easily
as
a
loan
on
eastern
timber
when
you
came
right
down
to
that
even
could
he
have
known
his
intentions
they
would
on
this
account
have
caused
him
no
uneasiness
however
angry
they
would
have
made
him
or
however
determined
to
break
the
partnership
even
though
newmark
destroyed
utterly
the
profits
for
the
remaining
year
and
a
half
the
notes
had
to
run
he
could
not
thereby
ruin
orde
chances
a
loan
on
the
california
timber
would
solve
all
problems
now
in
this
reasoning
orde
would
have
committed
the
mistake
of
all
large
and
generous
temperaments
when
called
upon
to
measure
natures
more
subtle
than
their
own
he
would
have
underestimated
both
newmark
resources
and
his
own
grasp
of
situations
the
author
has
considered
it
useless
to
burden
the
course
of
the
narrative
with
a
detailed
account
of
financial
manoeuvres
realising
however
that
a
large
class
of
his
readers
might
be
interested
in
the
exact
particulars
he
herewith
gives
a
sketch
of
the
transactions
it
will
be
remembered
that
at
the
time
orde
first
came
in
need
of
money
for
the
purpose
of
buying
the
california
timber
the
firm
newmark
and
orde
owned
in
the
northern
peninsula
feet
of
pine
on
this
they
had
paid
and
owed
still
a
like
amount
they
borrowed
on
it
giving
a
note
secured
by
mortgage
due
in
orde
took
this
giving
in
return
his
note
secured
by
the
boom
company
stock
in
and
they
made
the
two
final
payments
on
the
timber
so
that
by
the
latter
date
they
owned
the
land
free
of
encumbrance
save
for
the
mortgage
of
since
newmark
plan
had
always
contemplated
the
eventual
foreclosure
of
this
mortgage
it
now
became
necessary
further
to
encumber
the
property
otherwise
since
a
property
worth
considerably
above
carried
only
a
mortgage
it
would
be
possible
when
the
latter
came
due
to
borrow
a
further
sum
on
a
second
mortgage
with
which
to
meet
the
obligations
of
the
first
therefore
newmark
in
approached
orde
with
the
request
that
the
firm
raise
by
means
of
a
second
mortgage
on
the
timber
this
he
proposed
to
borrow
personally
giving
his
note
due
in
and
putting
up
the
same
collateral
as
orde
had
that
is
to
say
his
stock
in
the
boom
company
to
this
orde
could
hardly
in
reason
oppose
an
objection
as
it
nearly
duplicated
his
own
transaction
of
newmark
therefore
through
heinzman
lent
this
sum
to
himself
it
may
now
be
permitted
to
forecast
events
in
the
line
of
newmark
reasoning
if
his
plans
should
work
out
this
is
what
would
happen
in
the
firm
note
for
would
come
due
orde
would
be
unable
to
pay
it
therefore
at
once
his
stock
in
the
boom
company
would
become
the
property
of
newmark
and
orde
newmark
would
profess
himself
unable
to
raise
enough
from
the
firm
to
pay
the
mortgage
the
second
mortgage
from
which
he
had
drawn
his
personal
loan
would
render
it
impossible
for
the
firm
to
raise
more
money
on
the
land
a
foreclosure
would
follow
through
heinzman
newmark
would
buy
in
as
he
had
himself
loaned
the
money
to
himself
again
through
heinzman
on
the
second
mortgage
the
latter
would
occasion
him
no
loss
the
net
results
of
the
whole
transaction
would
be
first
that
newmark
would
have
acquired
personally
the
feet
of
northern
peninsula
timber
and
second
that
personal
share
in
the
stock
company
would
flow
be
held
in
partnership
by
the
two
thus
in
order
to
gain
so
large
a
stake
it
would
pay
newmark
to
suffer
considerable
loss
jointly
with
orde
in
the
induced
misfortunes
of
the
firm
incidentally
it
might
be
remarked
that
newmark
of
course
purposed
paying
his
own
note
to
the
firm
when
it
should
fall
due
in
thus
saving
for
himself
the
boom
company
stock
which
he
had
put
up
as
collateral
affairs
stood
thus
in
the
autumn
before
the
year
the
notes
would
come
due
the
weather
had
been
beautiful
a
perpetual
summer
seemed
to
have
embalmed
the
world
in
its
forgetfulness
of
times
and
seasons
navigation
remained
open
through
october
and
into
november
no
severe
storms
had
as
yet
swept
the
lakes
the
barge
and
her
two
tows
had
made
one
more
trip
than
had
been
thought
possible
it
had
been
the
intention
to
lay
them
up
for
the
winter
but
the
weather
continued
so
mild
that
orde
suggested
they
be
laden
with
a
consignment
for
jones
and
mabley
of
chicago
intend
to
ship
by
rail
said
he
all
so
it
would
pay
all
right
but
we
can
save
all
kinds
of
money
by
water
and
they
ought
to
skip
over
there
in
twelve
to
fifteen
accordingly
the
three
vessels
were
laid
alongside
the
wharves
at
the
mill
and
as
fast
as
possible
the
selected
lumber
was
passed
into
their
holds
orde
departed
for
the
woods
to
start
the
cutting
as
soon
as
the
first
belated
snow
should
fall
this
condition
seemed
however
to
delay
during
each
night
it
grew
cold
the
leaves
after
their
blaze
and
riot
of
colour
turned
crisp
and
crackly
and
brown
some
of
the
little
still
puddles
were
filmed
with
what
was
almost
but
not
quite
ice
a
sheen
of
frost
whitened
the
house
roofs
and
silvered
each
separate
blade
of
grass
on
the
lawns
but
by
noon
the
sun
rising
red
in
the
veil
of
smoke
that
hung
low
in
the
snappy
air
had
mellowed
the
atmosphere
until
it
lay
on
the
cheek
like
a
caress
no
breath
of
wind
stirred
sounds
came
clearly
from
a
distance
long
flights
of
geese
swept
athwart
the
sky
very
high
up
but
their
honking
came
faintly
to
the
ear
and
yet
when
the
sun
swollen
to
the
great
dimensions
of
the
rising
moon
dipped
through
the
haze
the
first
premonitory
tingle
of
cold
warned
one
that
the
grateful
warmth
of
the
day
had
been
but
an
illusion
of
a
season
that
had
gone
this
was
not
summer
but
in
the
quaint
old
phrase
indian
summer
and
its
end
would
be
as
though
the
necromancer
had
waved
his
wand
to
newmark
sitting
at
his
desk
reported
captain
floyd
of
the
steam
barge
north
star
loaded
by
noon
sir
he
said
newmark
looked
up
in
surprise
why
do
you
tell
me
he
inquired
want
your
orders
why
is
a
bad
time
of
year
explained
captain
floyd
the
storm
signal
up
all
the
signs
are
right
for
a
newmark
whirled
in
his
chair
blow
he
cried
of
it
you
do
come
in
every
time
it
blows
do
you
do
know
the
lakes
sir
at
this
time
of
year
insisted
captain
floyd
you
afraid
sneered
newmark
captain
floyd
countenance
burned
a
dark
red
only
want
your
orders
was
all
he
said
thought
we
might
wait
to
go
snapped
newmark
lumber
must
get
to
the
market
you
heard
orde
orders
to
sail
as
soon
as
you
were
captain
floyd
nodded
curtly
and
went
out
without
further
comment
newmark
arose
and
looked
out
of
the
window
the
sun
shone
as
balmily
soft
as
ever
english
sparrows
twittered
and
fought
outside
the
warm
smell
of
pine
shingles
rose
from
the
street
only
close
down
to
the
horizon
lurked
cold
flat
clouds
and
in
the
direction
of
the
government
he
caught
the
flash
of
red
from
the
lazily
floating
signal
he
was
little
weatherwise
and
he
shook
his
head
sceptically
nevertheless
it
was
a
chance
and
he
took
it
as
he
had
taken
a
great
many
others
xxxiv
to
carroll
delight
orde
returned
unexpectedly
from
the
woods
late
that
night
he
was
so
busy
these
days
that
she
welcomed
any
chance
to
see
him
much
to
his
disappointment
bobby
had
been
taken
by
his
old
friend
kincaid
next
morning
however
orde
told
carroll
his
stay
would
be
short
and
that
his
day
would
be
occupied
take
old
prince
and
get
some
air
he
advised
too
much
indoors
get
some
friend
and
drive
around
it
fine
and
blowy
out
and
you
get
some
colour
in
your
after
breakfast
carroll
accompanied
her
husband
to
the
front
door
when
they
opened
it
a
blast
of
air
rushed
in
whirling
some
dead
leaves
with
it
guess
the
fine
weather
over
said
orde
looking
up
at
the
sky
a
dull
lead
colour
had
succeeded
the
soft
gray
of
the
preceding
balmy
days
the
heavens
seemed
to
have
settled
down
closer
to
the
earth
a
rising
wind
whistled
through
the
branches
of
the
big
maple
trees
snatching
the
remaining
leaves
in
handfuls
and
tossing
them
into
the
air
the
tops
swayed
like
whips
whirlwinds
scurried
among
the
piles
of
dead
leaves
on
the
lawns
scattering
them
chasing
them
madly
around
and
around
in
circles
shivered
carroll
she
kept
herself
busy
about
the
house
all
the
morning
ate
her
lunch
in
solitude
outside
the
fierce
wind
rising
in
a
crescendo
shriek
howled
around
the
eaves
the
day
darkened
but
no
rain
fell
at
last
carroll
resolved
to
take
her
husband
advice
she
stopped
for
mina
heinzman
and
the
two
walked
around
to
the
stable
where
the
men
harnessed
old
prince
into
the
phaeton
they
drove
the
wind
at
their
backs
across
the
drawbridge
past
the
and
out
beyond
the
mills
to
the
marsh
road
there
on
either
side
the
causeway
miles
and
miles
of
and
reeds
bent
and
recovered
under
the
snatches
of
the
wind
here
and
there
showed
glimpses
of
ponds
or
little
inlets
the
surface
of
the
water
ruffled
and
dark
blue
occasionally
one
of
these
bayous
swung
in
across
the
road
then
the
two
girls
could
see
plainly
the
skittering
here
and
there
as
though
by
the
swooping
invisible
monster
that
pursued
them
carroll
and
mina
heinzman
had
a
good
time
they
liked
each
other
very
much
and
always
saw
a
great
deal
to
laugh
at
in
the
things
about
them
and
in
the
subjects
about
which
they
talked
when
however
they
turned
toward
home
they
were
forced
silent
by
the
mighty
power
of
the
wind
against
them
the
tears
ran
from
their
eyes
as
though
they
were
crying
they
had
to
lower
their
heads
hardly
could
carroll
command
vision
clear
enough
to
see
the
road
along
which
she
was
driving
this
was
really
unnecessary
for
prince
was
buffeted
to
a
walk
thus
they
crawled
along
until
they
reached
the
where
the
change
in
direction
gave
them
relief
the
river
was
full
of
choppy
waves
considerable
in
size
as
they
crossed
the
sprite
darted
beneath
them
lowering
her
smokestack
as
she
went
under
the
bridge
they
entered
main
street
where
was
a
great
banging
and
clanging
of
swinging
signs
and
a
few
loose
shutters
all
the
sidewalk
displays
of
vegetables
and
other
goods
had
been
taken
in
and
the
doors
customarily
wide
open
were
now
shut
fast
this
alone
lent
to
the
street
quite
a
deserted
air
which
was
emphasised
by
the
fact
that
actually
not
a
rig
of
any
sort
stood
at
the
curbs
up
the
empty
roadway
whirled
one
after
the
other
clouds
of
dust
hurried
by
the
wind
wonder
where
all
the
farmers
wagons
are
marvelled
the
practical
mina
they
would
not
stay
home
saturday
afternoon
just
for
this
wind
opposite
randall
hardware
store
her
curiosity
quite
mastered
her
stop
she
urged
carroll
want
to
run
in
and
see
what
the
she
was
gone
but
a
moment
and
returned
her
eyes
shining
with
excitement
carroll
she
cried
are
three
vessels
gone
ashore
off
the
piers
everybody
gone
to
in
said
carroll
drive
out
perhaps
they
get
out
the
they
drove
up
the
plank
road
over
the
through
the
beech
woods
to
the
bluff
above
the
shore
in
the
woods
they
were
somewhat
sheltered
from
the
wind
although
even
there
the
crash
of
falling
branches
and
the
whirl
of
twigs
and
dead
leaves
advertised
that
the
powers
of
the
air
were
abroad
but
when
they
topped
the
last
rise
the
unobstructed
blast
from
the
open
lake
hit
them
square
between
the
eyes
probably
a
hundred
vehicles
of
all
descriptions
were
hitched
to
trees
just
within
the
fringe
of
woods
carroll
however
drove
straight
ahead
until
prince
stood
at
the
top
of
the
plank
road
that
led
down
to
the
bath
houses
here
she
pulled
up
carroll
saw
the
lake
slate
blue
and
angry
with
billows
to
the
limit
of
vision
along
the
shore
were
rows
and
rows
of
breakers
leaping
breaking
and
gathering
again
until
they
were
lost
in
a
tumble
of
white
foam
that
rushed
and
receded
on
the
sands
these
did
not
look
to
be
very
large
until
she
noticed
the
twin
piers
reaching
out
from
the
river
mouth
each
billow
as
it
came
in
rose
sullenly
above
them
broke
tempestuously
to
overwhelm
the
entire
structure
of
their
ends
and
ripped
inshore
along
their
lengths
the
crest
submerging
as
it
ran
every
foot
of
the
massive
structures
the
piers
and
the
at
their
ends
looked
like
little
toys
and
the
compact
black
crowd
of
people
on
the
shore
below
were
as
small
as
bobby
tin
soldiers
there
out
farther
pointed
mina
carroll
looked
and
rose
to
her
feet
in
excitement
three
little
toy
ships
or
so
they
seemed
compared
to
the
mountains
of
water
lay
just
inside
the
farthest
line
of
breakers
two
were
sailing
schooners
these
had
been
thrown
on
their
beam
ends
their
masts
pointing
at
an
angle
toward
the
beach
each
wave
as
it
reached
stirred
them
a
trifle
then
broke
in
a
deluge
of
water
that
for
a
moment
covered
their
hulls
completely
from
sight
with
a
mighty
suction
the
billow
drained
away
carrying
with
it
wreckage
the
third
vessel
was
a
steam
barge
she
too
was
broadside
to
the
seas
but
had
caught
in
some
hole
in
the
bar
so
that
she
lay
far
down
by
the
head
the
shoreward
side
of
her
upper
works
had
for
some
freakish
reason
given
away
first
so
now
the
interior
of
her
staterooms
and
saloons
was
exposed
to
view
as
in
the
of
a
model
ship
over
her
too
the
great
waves
hurled
themselves
each
carrying
away
its
spoil
to
carroll
it
seemed
fantastically
as
though
the
barge
were
made
of
sugar
and
that
each
sea
melted
her
precisely
as
bobby
loved
to
melt
the
lump
in
his
chocolate
by
raising
and
lowering
it
in
a
spoon
and
the
queer
part
of
it
all
was
that
these
waves
so
mighty
in
their
effects
appeared
to
the
woman
no
different
from
those
she
had
often
watched
in
the
light
summer
blows
that
for
a
few
hours
raise
the
on
the
lake
they
came
in
from
the
open
in
the
same
swift
yet
deliberate
ranks
they
gathered
with
the
same
leisurely
pauses
they
broke
with
the
same
rush
and
roar
they
seemed
no
larger
but
everything
else
had
been
struck
small
the
tiny
ships
the
toy
piers
the
swarm
of
people
on
the
shore
she
looked
on
it
as
a
spectacle
it
had
as
yet
no
human
significance
fellows
cried
mina
asked
carroll
you
see
them
queried
the
other
carroll
looked
and
in
the
rigging
of
the
schooner
she
made
out
a
number
of
black
objects
those
men
up
the
masts
she
cried
she
set
prince
in
motion
toward
the
beach
at
the
foot
of
the
bluff
the
plank
road
ran
out
into
the
deep
sand
through
this
the
phaeton
made
its
way
heavily
the
fine
particles
were
blown
in
the
air
like
a
spray
mingling
with
the
spume
from
the
lake
stinging
carroll
face
like
so
many
needles
already
the
beach
was
strewn
with
pieces
of
wreckage
some
of
it
cast
high
above
the
wash
others
still
thrown
up
and
sucked
back
by
each
wave
others
again
rising
and
falling
in
the
billows
this
wreckage
constituted
a
miscellaneous
jumble
although
most
of
it
was
lumber
from
the
of
the
vessels
intermingled
with
the
split
and
broken
yellow
boards
were
bits
of
carving
and
of
painted
wood
carroll
saw
one
piece
half
buried
in
the
sand
which
bore
in
gilt
two
huge
letters
a
a
little
farther
bent
and
twisted
projected
the
ornamental
spear
which
had
pointed
the
way
before
the
steamer
bow
portions
of
the
usual
miscellaneous
freight
cargo
carried
on
every
voyage
were
scattered
along
the
shore
boxes
barrels
and
crates
five
or
six
men
had
rolled
a
whisky
barrel
beyond
the
reach
of
the
water
had
broached
it
and
now
were
drinking
in
turn
from
a
broken
and
dingy
fragment
of
a
they
were
very
dirty
their
hair
had
fallen
over
their
eyes
which
were
bloodshot
the
expression
of
their
faces
was
imbecile
as
the
phaeton
passed
they
hailed
its
occupants
in
thick
voices
shouting
against
the
wind
maudlin
invitations
to
drink
the
crowd
gathered
at
the
pier
comprised
fully
half
the
population
of
monrovia
it
centred
about
the
life
saving
crew
whose
mortar
was
being
loaded
a
lifeboat
mutely
attested
the
failure
of
other
efforts
the
men
worked
busily
ramming
home
the
powder
sack
placing
the
projectile
with
the
light
line
attached
attending
that
the
reel
ran
freely
their
chief
watched
the
seas
and
winds
through
his
glasses
when
the
preparations
were
finished
he
adjusted
the
mortar
and
pulled
the
string
carroll
had
seen
this
done
in
practice
now
with
the
recollection
of
that
experience
in
mind
she
was
astonished
at
the
feeble
report
of
the
piece
and
its
freedom
from
the
dense
white
clouds
of
smoke
that
should
have
enveloped
it
the
wind
snatched
both
noise
and
vapour
away
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
born
the
dart
with
its
trailer
of
line
rose
on
a
long
graceful
curve
the
reel
sang
every
member
of
the
crowd
unconsciously
leaned
forward
in
attention
but
the
resistance
of
the
wind
and
the
line
early
made
itself
felt
slower
and
slower
hummed
the
reel
there
came
a
time
when
the
missile
seemed
to
hesitate
then
fairly
to
stand
in
equilibrium
finally
in
an
increasingly
abrupt
curve
it
descended
into
the
sea
by
a
good
three
hundred
yards
the
shot
had
failed
to
carry
the
line
over
the
vessels
bradford
said
carroll
waving
her
hand
wish
he
come
and
tell
us
something
about
the
village
brummell
saw
the
signal
and
came
his
face
grave
they
get
the
lifeboats
out
to
them
asked
carroll
as
he
approached
see
that
one
said
bradford
pointing
the
other
in
kindling
wood
farther
up
the
drowned

quickly
we
got

he
glanced
down
at
himself
comically
and
the
girls
for
the
first
time
noticed
that
beneath
the
heavy
overcoat
his
garments
were
dripping
surely
they
never
get
a
line
over
with
the
mortar
said
carroll
last
shot
fell
so
far

it
they
shot
a

they
shoot
from

they
be
ever
so
much
it
replied
bradford
succinctly
lost
the
whole
nobody
said
anything
for
some
time
but
all
looked
helplessly
to
where
the
vessels
from
this
elevation
insignificant
among
the
tumbling
waters
were
pounding
to
pieces
at
this
moment
from
the
river
a
trail
of
black
smoke
became
visible
over
the
point
of
that
ran
down
to
the
pier
a
smokestack
darted
into
view
slowed
down
and
came
to
rest
well
inside
the
there
it
rose
and
fell
regularly
under
the
influence
of
the
swell
that
swung
in
from
the
lake
the
crowd
uttered
a
cheer
and
streamed
in
the
direction
of
the
smokestack
and
see
what
up
suggested
bradford
he
hitched
prince
to
a
log
sticking
up
at
an
angle
from
the
sand
and
led
the
way
to
the
pier
there
they
had
difficulty
in
getting
close
enough
to
see
but
bradford
preceding
the
two
women
succeeded
by
patience
and
diplomacy
in
forcing
a
way
the
sprite
was
lying
close
under
the
pier
the
top
of
her
just
about
level
with
the
feet
of
the
people
watching
her
she
rose
and
fell
with
the
restless
waters
fat
bumpers
interposed
between
her
sides
and
the
piling
the
was
empty
but
harvey
the
negro
engineer
leaned
elbows
crossed
against
the
sill
of
his
little
square
door
smoking
his
pipe

go
out
there
for
a
million
dollars
cried
a
man
excitedly
to
carroll
and
bradford
on

that
sea

bradford
did
not
wait
for
him
to
finish
he
turned
abruptly
and
with
an
air
of
authority
brushed
toward
the
tug
followed
closely
by
carroll
and
mina
at
the
edge
of
the
pier
was
the
tug
captain
marsh
listening
to
earnest
expostulation
by
a
of
the
leading
men
of
the
town
among
whom
were
both
newmark
and
orde
as
the
three
came
within
earshot
captain

forth
the
stump
of

standing
near

captain

it
settled

up

the
engineer
slowly
hoisted
his
long
figure
through
the
doorway
dragged
his
legs
under
him
then
with
extraordinary
agility
swung
to
the
pier
his
teeth
shining
like
ivory
in
his
black
face

harvey

began
to

the
slabs
from
the
deck
into
the
hold

said
captain
marsh
the
four
men
from
the
service
dropped
aboard
the
five
then
went
over
the
tug
from

up
to
shake
the
hand

stooping
offered

sir
said
he
hell
with

captain
marsh
deliberately
lit
another
cigar
and
entered
the
with
the
other
men
off
he
cried
and
the
silent
crowd
heard
clearly
the
single
sharp
bell
ringing
for
attention
and
then
the
that
called
for
full
speed
ahead
awed
they
watched
the
tiny
sturdy
craft
move
out
into
the
stream
and
point
to
the
fury
of
the
open
lake

brave
chaps

mcmullen
to

as
they
turned
away
the
physician
drew
his
tall
slender
figure
to
its
height
chaps
every
one
of
them
but
do
you
know
to
my
mind
the
bravest
of
them
all
are
that
nigger
and
his
fireman
nailed
down
in
the
hold
where
they
ca
see
nor
know
what

and
if
if
the
good

blew
his

vigorously

or
six
times

i
take
that
the

is
degenerating
good
god
the
tug
had
rounded
the
end
of
the
pier
the
first
of
her
thousand
enemies
sweeping
in
from
the
open
had
struck
her
fair
a
great
sheet
of
white
water
slanting
back
and
up
shot
with
terrific
impact
against
the
house
and
beyond
for
an
instant
the
little
craft
seemed
buried
but
almost
immediately
the
gleam
of
her
black
hull
showed
her
plunging
forward
dauntlessly
nothin
said
the
tug
captain
who
had
first
spoken
she
gets
outside
the
watchers
streamed
down
from
the
pier
for
a
better
view
carroll
and
miss
heinzman
followed
they
saw
the
staunch
little
craft
drive
into
three
big
seas
each
of
which
appeared
to
bury
her
completely
save
for
her
upper
works
she
managed
however
to
keep
her
headway
can
stand
that
all
right
said
one
of
the
crew
who
had
been
watching
her
critically
trouble
will
come
when
she
drops
down
to
the
in
spite
of
the
heavy
smashing
of
seas
the
sprite
held
her
course
straight
out

anyway
marvelled
little
smith
the
stationer
away
beyond
the
wrecks
marsh
has
found
the
seas
heavier
than
he
thought
and
is
afraid
to
turn
her
broadside
guessed
his
companion
hell
snorted
a
riverman
who
overheard
nevertheless
the
sprite
was
now
so
distant
that
the
loom
of
the
great
seas
on
the
horizon
swallowed
her
from
view
save
when
she
rose
on
the
crest
of
some
mighty
billow
what
is
he
doing
out
there
then
challenged
friend
with
some
asperity
replied
the
riverman
whatever
it
is
it
all
right
as
long
as
buck
marsh
is
at
the
she
turned
now
smith
interposed
beneath
the
trail
of
black
smoke
she
had
shifted
direction
and
then
with
startling
swiftness
the
sprite
darted
out
of
the
horizon
into
full
view
for
the
first
time
the
spectators
realised
the
size
and
weight
of
the
seas
not
even
the
sullen
pounding
to
pieces
of
the
vessels
on
the
bar
had
so
impressed
them
as
the
sight
of
the
tug
coasting
with
railroad
speed
down
the
rush
of
a
comber
like
a
child
in
the
surf
one
moment
the
whole
of
her
deck
was
visible
as
she
was
borne
with
the
wave
the
next
her
bow
alone
showed
high
as
the
back
suction
caught
her
and
dragged
her
from
the
crest
into
the
hollow
a
sea
rose
behind
nothing
of
the
tug
was
to
be
seen
it
seemed
that
no
power
or
skill
could
prevent
her
feeling
overwhelmed
yet
somehow
always
she
staggered
out
of
the
gulf
until
she
caught
the
force
of
the
billow
and
was
again
cast
forward
like
a
chip
they
ai
catchin
hell
at
that
wheel
to
hold
her
from
yawing
muttered
the
tug
captain
to
his
neighbour
who
happened
to
be
duncan
the
minister
almost
before
carroll
had
time
to
see
that
the
little
craft
was
coming
in
she
had
arrived
at
the
outer
line
of
breakers
here
the
combers
dragged
by
the
bar
underneath
crested
curled
over
and
fell
with
a
roar
just
as
in
milder
weather
the
surf
breaks
on
the
beach
when
the
sprite
rushed
at
this
outer
line
of
a
woman
in
the
crowd
screamed
but
at
the
edge
of
destruction
the
sprite
came
to
a
shuddering
stop
her
powerful
propellers
had
been
set
to
the
reverse
they
could
not
hold
her
against
the
forward
fling
of
the
water
but
what
she
lost
thus
she
regained
on
the
seaward
slopes
of
the
waves
and
in
their
hollows
thus
she
hovered
on
the
edge
of
the
breakers
awaiting
her
chance
as
long
as
the
seas
rolled
in
steadily
and
nothing
broke
she
was
safe
but
if
one
of
the
waves
should
happen
to
crest
and
break
as
many
of
them
did
the
weight
of
water
catching
the
tug
on
her
flat
broad
stern
deck
would
indubitably
bury
her
the
situation
was
awful
in
its
extreme
simplicity
would
captain
marsh
see
his
opportunity
before
the
law
of
chances
would
bring
along
the
wave
that
would
overwhelm
him
a
realisation
of
the
crisis
came
to
the
crowd
on
the
beach
at
once
the
terrible
strain
of
suspense
tugged
at
their
souls
each
conducted
himself
according
to
his
nature
the
hardy
men
of
the
river
and
the
woods
set
their
teeth
until
the
cheek
muscles
turned
white
and
blasphemed
softly
and
steadily
two
or
three
of
the
townsmen
walked
up
and
down
the
space
of
a
dozen
feet
one
the
woman
who
had
screamed
prayed
aloud
in
short
hysterical
sentences
god
save
them
o
lord
o
lord
orde
stood
on
top
of
a
log
his
hat
in
his
hand
his
entire
being
concentrated
on
the
manoeuvre
being
executed
only
newmark
apparently
remained
as
calm
as
ever
leaning
against
an
upright
timber
his
arms
folded
and
an
unlighted
cigar
as
usual
between
his
lips
methodically
every
few
moments
he
removed
his
eyeglasses
and
wiped
the
lenses
free
of
spray
suddenly
without
warning
occurred
one
of
those
inexplicable
lulls
that
interpose
often
amid
the
wildest
uproars
for
the
briefest
instant
other
sounds
than
the
roar
of
the
wind
and
surf
were
permitted
the
multitude
on
the
beach
they
heard
the
grinding
of
timbers
from
the
stricken
ships
and
the
draining
away
of
waters
and
distinctly
they
heard
the
faint
far
tinkle
of
the
jangler
calling
again
for
speed
between
two
waves
the
sprite
darted
forward
directly
for
the
nearest
of
the
wrecks
straight
as
an
arrow
flight
she
held
until
from
the
crowd
went
up
a
groan
collide
some
one
put
it
into
words
but
at
the
latest
moment
the
tug
swerved
raced
past
and
turned
on
a
long
diagonal
across
the
end
of
the
bar
toward
the
piers
captain
marsh
had
chosen
his
moment
with
exactitude
to
the
utmost
he
had
taken
advantage
of
the
brief
lull
of
jumbled
seas
after
the
largest
had
swept
by
yet
in
shallow
water
and
with
the
strong
inshore
set
even
that
lull
was
all
too
short
the
sprite
was
staggered
by
the
buffets
of
the
smaller
breakers
her
speed
was
checked
her
stern
was
dragged
around
for
an
instant
it
seemed
that
the
back
suction
would
hold
her
in
its
grip
she
tore
herself
from
the
grasp
of
the
current
enveloped
in
a
blinding
hail
of
spray
she
struggled
desperately
to
extricate
herself
from
the
maelstrom
in
which
she
was
involved
before
the
resumption
of
the
larger
seas
should
roll
her
over
and
over
to
destruction
already
these
larger
seas
were
racing
in
from
the
open
to
carroll
watching
breathless
and
in
that
strange
passive
and
receptive
state
peculiar
to
imaginative
natures
they
seemed
alive
and
the
sprite
too
appeared
to
be
not
a
fabric
and
a
mechanism
controlled
by
men
but
a
sentient
creature
struggling
gallantly
on
her
own
volition
far
out
in
the
lake
against
the
tumbling
horizon
she
saw
heave
up
for
a
second
the
shoulder
of
a
mighty
wave
and
instinctively
she
perceived
this
wave
as
a
deadly
enemy
of
the
little
tug
and
saw
it
bending
all
its
great
energies
to
hurrying
in
on
time
to
catch
the
victim
before
it
could
escape
to
this
wave
she
gave
all
her
attention
watching
for
it
after
it
had
sunk
momentarily
below
its
fellows
recognising
it
instantly
as
it
rose
again
the
spasms
of
dismay
and
relief
among
the
crowd
about
her
she
did
not
share
at
all
the
crises
they
indicated
did
not
exist
for
her
until
the
wave
came
in
carroll
knew
the
sprite
no
matter
how
battered
and
tossed
would
be
safe
her
whole
being
was
concentrated
in
a
continually
shifting
calculation
of
the
respective
distances
between
the
tug
and
the
piers
the
tug
and
the
relentlessly
advancing
wave
go
she
exhorted
the
sprite
under
her
breath
then
the
crowd
too
caught
with
its
slower
perceptions
the
import
of
the
wave
carroll
felt
the
electric
thrill
of
apprehension
shiver
through
it
huge
and
towering
green
and
flecked
with
foam
the
wave
came
on
now
calmly
and
deliberately
as
though
sure
the
sprite
was
off
the
end
of
the
pier
when
the
wave
lifted
her
just
in
the
position
her
enemy
would
have
selected
to
crush
her
life
out
against
the
cribs
slowly
the
tug
rose
against
its
shoulder
was
lifted
onward
poised
and
then
with
a
swift
forward
thrust
the
wave
broke
smothering
the
pier
and
lighthouse
beneath
tons
of
water
a
low
agonised
wail
broke
from
the
crowd
and
then
and
then
over
beyond
the
pier
down
which
the
wave
broken
and
spent
but
formidable
still
was
ripping
its
way
they
saw
gliding
a
battered
black
stack
from
which
still
poured
defiantly
clouds
of
gray
smoke
for
ten
seconds
the
spectators
could
not
believe
their
eyes
they
had
distinctly
seen
the
sprite
caught
between
a
resistless
wall
of
water
and
the
pier
where
she
should
have
been
crushed
like
the
proverbial
yet
there
she
was
or
her
ghost
then
a
great
cheer
rose
up
against
the
wind
the
crowd
went
crazy
mere
acquaintances
hugged
each
other
and
danced
around
and
around
through
the
heavy
sands
several
women
had
hysterics
the
riverman
next
to
duncan
opened
his
mouth
and
swore
so
picturesquely
that
as
he
afterward
told
his
chum
must
been
plumb
inspired
for
the
yet
it
never
entered
duncan
ministerial
head
to
reprove
the
blasphemy
orde
jumped
down
from
his
log
and
clapped
his
hat
on
his
head
newmark
did
not
alter
his
attitude
nor
his
expression
the
sprite
was
safe
for
the
few
moments
before
she
glided
the
length
of
the
long
pier
to
stiller
water
this
fact
sufficed
wonder
if
she
got
the
line
aboard
speculated
the
captain
at
last
the
crowd
surged
over
to
the
piers
again
below
them
rose
and
fell
the
sprite
all
the
fancy
of
her
upper
works
the
cornice
of
her
deck
house
the
light
rigging
of
her
cabin
had
disappeared
leaving
raw
and
splintered
wood
to
mark
their
attachments
the
tall
smokestack
was
bent
awry
but
its
supports
had
held
which
was
fortunate
since
otherwise
the
fires
would
have
been
drowned
out
at
the
moment
captain
marsh
was
bending
over
examining
a
bad
break
in
the
overhang
the
only
material
damage
the
tug
had
sustained
at
sight
of
him
the
crowd
set
up
a
yell
he
paid
no
attention
one
of
the
men
tossed
a
mooring
line
ashore
it
was
seized
by
a
dozen
men
then
for
the
first
time
somebody
noticed
that
although
the
tug
had
come
to
a
standstill
her
screw
was
still
turning
slowly
over
and
over
holding
her
against
the
erratic
strong
jerking
of
a
slender
rope
that
ran
through
her
stern
chocks
and
into
the
water
got
it
aboard
yelled
the
man
pointing
another
cheer
broke
out
the
crew
leaped
to
the
deck
they
were
immediately
followed
by
a
crowd
of
enthusiasts
eager
to
congratulate
and
question
but
captain
marsh
would
have
none
of
them
off
my
tug
he
shouted
you
want
to
swamp
her
what
do
you
suppose
we
put
that
line
aboard
for
fun
get
busy
and
use
it
rescue
that

now
abashed
the
enthusiasts
scrambled
back
the
crew
took
charge
it
was
necessary
to
pass
the
line
around
the
end
of
the
pier
and
back
to
the
beach
this
was
a
dangerous
job
and
one
requiring
considerable
power
and
ingenuity
for
the
strain
on
the
line
imposed
by
the
waters
was
terrific
and
the
breaking
seas
rendered
work
on
the
piers
extremely
hazardous
however
the
captain
took
charge
confidently
enough
his
crew
began
to
struggle
out
the
pier
while
volunteers
under
his
personal
direction
manipulated
the
reel
a
number
of
the
curious
lingered
about
the
sprite
marsh

orde
were
in
consultation
over
the
smashed
stern

did
not

saying
emphatically
to
his
employer

on
one
thing

grinned
marsh
they
turned
away
together
and
were
at
once
pounced
on
by
leopold
lincoln
bunn
the
local
reporter
a
callow
youth
aflame
with
the
chance
for
a
big
story
of
more
than
local
interest
captain
marsh
he
cried
did
you
get
around
the
pier
it
looked
as
though
the
wave
had
you
orde
glanced
at
his
companion
in
curiosity
roller
skates
replied
marsh
leopold
tittered
nervously
you
tell
me
how
you
felt
when
you
were
out
there
in
the
worst
of
it
he
inquired
hell
said
marsh
grumpily
stalking
away
interview
for
a

does
he
grinned
orde
orde
perhaps
you
you
think
we
better
lend
a
hand
below
suggested
orde
pointing
to
the
beach
the
wild
and
picturesque
work
of
rescue
was
under
way
the
line
had
been
successfully
brought
to
the
left
of
the
lighthouse
to
it
had
been
attached
the
rope
and
to
that
the
heavy
cable
these
the
crew
of
the
schooner
had
dragged
out
and
made
fast
to
a
mast
the
shore
end
passed
over
a
tall
scissors
when
the
cable
was
tightened
the
breeches
buoy
was
put
into
commission
and
before
long
the
first
member
of
the
crew
was
hauled
ashore
plunging
in
and
out
of
the
waves
as
the
rope
tightened
or
slackened
he
was
a
norwegian
who
stamped
his
feet
shook
his
body
and
grinned
comically
at
those
about
him
he
accepted
with
equanimity
a
dozen
drinks
of
whisky
thrust
at
him
from
all
sides
swigged
a
mug
of
the
coffee
a
few
practical
women
were
making
over
an
open
fire
and
opposed
to
leopold
lincoln
bunn
frantic
efforts
a
stolid
and
baffling
density
of
none
of
these
attentions
did
he
seem
to
stand
in
especial
need
the
crew
and
its
volunteers
worked
quickly
when
the
last
man
had
come
ashore
the
captain
of
the
service
entered
the
breeches
buoy
and
caused
himself
to
be
hauled
through
the
smother
to
the
wreck
after
an
interval
a
signal
jerked
back
the
buoy
was
pulled
in
empty
and
the
surf
car
substituted
in
it
were
piled
various
utensils
of
equipment
one
man
went
with
it
and
several
more
on
its
next
trip
until
nearly
the
whole
crew
were
aboard
the
wreck
carroll
and
mina
stayed
until
dusk
and
after
watching
the
long
heavy
labour
of
rescue
lines
had
to
be
rocketed
from
the
schooner
to
the
other
vessels
then
by
their
means
cable
communication
had
to
be
established
with
the
shore
after
this
it
was
really
a
matter
of
routine
to
run
the
crew
to
the
beach
though
cruel
hard
work
and
dangerous
the
wrecks
were
continually
swept
by
the
great
seas
and
at
any
moment
the
tortured
fabrics
might
give
way
might
dissolve
completely
in
the
elements
that
so
battered
them
the
women
making
the
hot
coffee
found
their
services
becoming
valuable
big
fires
of
driftwood
were
ignited
they
were
useful
for
light
as
well
as
warmth
by
their
illumination
finally
orde
discovered
the
two
girls
standing
and
paused
long
enough
in
his
own
heavy
labour
of
assistance
to
draw
carroll
one
side
better
go
home
now
sweetheart
said
he
be
waiting
for
you
and
the
girls
may
be
here
in
the
crowd
somewhere
there
be
nobody
to
take
care
of
suppose
so
she
assented
has
it
been
exciting
whose
vessels
were

do
you
know

at
her
strangely

said
he
she
looked
up
at
him
catching
quickly
the
wrinkles
of
his
brow
and
the
harassed
anxiety
in
his
eyes
impulsively
she
pulled
him
down
to
her
and
kissed
him
mind
dear
said
she
care
only
if
you
she
patted
his
great
shoulders
lightly
and
smiled
up
at
him
help
she
cried
come
home
as
soon
as
you
can
i
have
something
nice
and
hot
all
ready
for
she
turned
away
the
smile
still
on
her
lips
but
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
sight
her
face
fell
grave
mina
she
said
to
the
younger
girl
to
they
toiled
through
the
heavy
sand
to
where
hours
ago
they
had
left
prince
that
faithful
animal
dozed
in
his
tracks
and
awoke
reluctantly
carroll
looked
back
the
fires
leaped
red
and
yellow
against
them
were
the
silhouettes
of
people
and
in
the
farther
circle
of
their
illumination
were
more
people
cast
in
bronze
that
flickered
red
in
contrast
to
their
glow
the
night
was
very
dark
only
from
the
lake
there
disengaged
a
faint
gray
light
where
the
waters
broke
the
strength
of
the
failing
wind
still
lifted
the
finer
particles
of
sand
the
organ
of
the
pounding
surf
filled
the
night
with
the
grandeur
of
its
music
xxxv
orde
mounted
the
office
stairs
next
day
with
a
very
heavy
step
the
loss
of
the
north
star
and
of
the
two
schooners
meant
a
great
deal
to
him
at
that
time
kicks
us
into
somewhat
of
a
hole
he
grumbled
to
newmark
loss
is
never
pleasant
replied
the
latter
it
puts
us
out
of
the
carrying
business
for
awhile
but
we
ca
understand
why
floyd
started
said
orde
ought
to
know
better
than
to
face
sure
prospects
of
a
fall
blow
i
tan
his
soul
for
that
all
right
afraid
i
partly
responsible
for
his
going
put
in
newmark
cried
orde
you
see
that
smith
and
mabley
shipment
was
important
enough
to
strain
a
point
for
and
it
only
hours
or
so
and
it
certainly
did
look
to
see
me
as
if
it
were
going
to
blow
very
soon
poor
floyd
feels
bad
enough
he
about
orde
for
the
first
time
began
to
appreciate
the
pressure
of
his
circumstances
the
loss
on
the
cargo
of
reached
about
feet
which
represented
in
money
as
for
the
north
star
and
her
consorts
save
for
the
insurance
they
were
simply
eliminated
they
had
represented
property
now
they
were
gone
the
loss
of
or
so
on
them
however
did
not
mean
a
diminution
of
the
company
present
cash
resources
to
that
amount
and
so
did
not
immediately
affect
calculations
as
to
the
payment
of
the
notes
which
were
now
soon
to
come
due
at
this
time
the
woods
work
increasingly
demanded
his
attention
he
disappeared
for
a
week
his
organising
abilities
claimed
for
the
distribution
of
the
road
crews
when
he
returned
to
the
office
newmark
with
an
air
of
small
triumph
showed
him
contracts
for
the
construction
of
three
new
vessels
get
them
for
said
he
of
it
on
long
consulting
me
cried
orde
newmark
explained
carefully
that
the
action
seemingly
so
abrupt
had
really
been
taking
advantage
of
a
lucky
opportunity
he
finished
should
have
been
able
to
get
the
job
done
for
another
year
at
least
if
that
big
cronin
contract
goes
through
well
you
know
what
that
would
mean
in
the
shipyards
nobody
would
get
even
a
and
mcleod
is
willing
in
the
meantime
to
give
us
a
price
to
keep
his
men
busy
so
you
see
i
had
to
close
at
once
you
can
see
what
a
short
chance
it
a
good
chance
all
right
admitted
orde
why
that
is
i
thought
perhaps
we
job
our
own
freighting
for
awhile
it
never
occurred
to
me
we
build
any
more
vessels
until
we
recovered
a
newmark
repeated
coldly
do
see
what
has
to
do
with
it
if
the
mill
burned
down
we
rebuild
would
we
even
if
we
were
embarrassed
which
we
not
we
hardly
care
to
acknowledge
publicly
that
we
could
keep
up
our
equipment
and
as
we
making
twelve
or
fifteen
thousand
a
year
out
of
our
freighting
it
seems
to
me
too
good
a
business
to
let
slip
into
other
suppose
so
agreed
orde
a
trifle
helplessly
i
had
to
act
without
you
newmark
finished
knew
agree
that
right
is
it
he
insisted
that
right
agreed
orde
drearily
find
copies
of
the
contract
on
your
desk
newmark
closed
the
matter
there
the
tax
lists
i
wish
you
run
them
replied
orde
i
do
think
i
stay
down
town
this
morning
i
newmark
glanced
up
keenly
do
look
a
bit
well
said
he
of
pale
around
the
gills
bilious
do
believe
that
camp
grub
quite
agrees
with
you
for
a
steady
that
must
be
it
assented
orde
he
closed
his
desk
and
went
out
newmark
turned
back
to
his
papers
his
face
was
expressionless
from
an
inner
pocket
he
produced
a
cigar
which
he
thrust
between
his
teeth
the
corners
of
his
mouth
slowly
curved
in
a
grim
smile
orde
did
not
go
home
instead
he
walked
down
main
street
to
the
docks
where
he
jumped
into
a
rowboat
lying
in
a
slip
and
with
a
few
rapid
strokes
shot
out
on
the
stream
in
his
younger
days
he
had
belonged
to
a
boat
club
and
had
rowed
in
the
he
still
loved
the
oar
and
though
his
racing
days
were
past
he
maintained
a
rather
unstable
little
craft
which
it
was
his
delight
to
propel
rapidly
with
long
whenever
he
needed
exercise
however
he
was
content
to
drift
the
morning
was
still
and
golden
the
crispness
of
late
fall
had
infused
a
wine
into
the
air
the
sky
was
a
soft
the
were
a
dazzling
yellow
orde
did
not
try
to
think
he
merely
faced
the
situation
staring
it
in
the
face
until
it
should
shrink
to
its
true
significance
one
thing
he
felt
distinctly
yet
could
not
without
a
struggle
bring
himself
to
see
the
california
lands
must
be
mortgaged
if
he
could
raise
a
reasonable
sum
of
money
on
them
he
would
still
be
perfectly
able
to
meet
his
notes
he
hated
fiercely
to
raise
that
money
it
was
entirely
a
matter
of
sentiment
orde
realised
the
fact
clearly
and
browbeat
his
other
self
with
a
savage
contempt
nevertheless
his
dream
had
been
to
keep
the
western
timber
free
and
unencumbered
for
bobby
dreams
are
harder
to
give
up
than
realities
he
fell
into
the
deepest
reflections
which
were
broken
only
when
the
pounding
of
surf
warned
him
he
had
drifted
almost
to
the
open
lake
after
all
there
was
no
essential
difference
between
owing
money
to
a
man
in
michigan
and
to
a
man
in
california
that
was
the
net
result
of
his
struggle
the
time
comes
we
just
borrow
that
money
on
a
mortgage
like
sensible
people
he
said
aloud
quit
this
everlasting
back
to
town
he
pulled
with
long
vigorous
strokes
skittering
his
feathered
lightly
over
the
tops
of
the
wavelets
at
the
slip
he
made
fast
the
boat
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
office
his
step
springy
his
face
glowing
newmark
glanced
up
said
he
again
you
look
said
orde
in
his
hearty
manner
old
boy
you
ought
to
try
it
greatest
thing
in
the
world
just
took
a
row
to
the
end
of
the
piers
and
back
and
i
as
fit
as
a
fiddle
xxxvi
orde
immediately
set
into
motion
the
machinery
of
banking
to
borrow
on
the
california
timber
taylor
took
charge
of
this
as
the
only
man
in
monrovia
who
had
orde
confidence
at
the
end
of
a
necessary
delay
orde
received
notice
that
the
west
had
been
heard
from
he
stepped
across
the
hall
to
the
lawyer
office
frank
said
he
we
managed
to
push
it
through
with
so
little
taylor
arose
shut
carefully
the
door
into
his
outer
office
walked
to
the
window
looked
contemplatively
out
upon
the
hotel
backyard
and
returned
to
his
desk
there
is
trouble
said
he
curtly
the
matter
asked
orde
banks
refuse
the
orde
stared
at
him
in
blank
astonishment
he
echoed
grounds
can
they
possibly
have
for
that
ca
make
out
exactly
from
these
advices
it
something
about
the
i
thought
you
went
over
the
did
stated
taylor
emphatically
i
stake
my
reputation
as
a
lawyer
that
everything
is
straight
and
clear
from
the
land
office
itself
i
wired
for
an
explanation
and
we
ought
surely
to
know
something
definite
by
with
this
uncertainty
orde
was
forced
to
be
content
for
the
first
time
in
his
business
career
a
real
anxiety
gnawed
at
his
vitals
he
had
been
in
many
tight
places
but
somehow
heretofore
success
or
failure
had
seemed
to
him
about
immaterial
like
points
gained
or
conceded
in
the
game
a
fresh
start
was
always
so
easy
and
what
had
been
already
won
as
yet
unreal
now
the
game
itself
was
at
issue
property
reputation
and
the
family
future
were
at
stake
when
the
three
had
lived
in
the
tiny
house
by
the
church
it
had
seemed
that
no
adversity
could
touch
them
but
now
that
long
use
had
accustomed
them
to
larger
quarters
servants
luxuries
orde
could
not
conceive
the
possibility
of
carroll
ever
returning
to
that
simplest
existence
carroll
could
have
told
him
otherwise
but
of
course
he
did
not
as
yet
bring
the
possibility
before
her
she
had
economised
closely
these
last
few
years
orde
was
proud
of
her
he
was
also
fiercely
resentful
that
his
own
foolishness
or
untoward
circumstances
or
a
combination
of
both
should
jeopardise
her
future
therefore
he
awaited
further
news
with
the
greatest
impatience
the
message
came
the
following
day
as
taylor
had
predicted
taylor
handed
it
to
him
without
comment
office
under
investigation
orde
read
entries
suspected
all
titles
clouded
until
decision
is
do
you
suppose
that
means
asked
orde
although
he
knew
well
enough
taylor
glanced
up
at
his
dull
eyes
with
commiseration
simply
wo
lend
good
money
on
an
uncertainty
said
he
said
orde
rousing
himself
with
an
effort
got
to
be
here
i
could
get
away
this
winter
if
my
life
depended
on
it
and
i
wo
even
have
time
to
pay
much
attention
to
it
from
here
i
want
you
to
go
to
california
and
look
after
those
interests
for
me
never
mind
your
practice
man
as
taylor
tried
to
interrupt
him
what
arrangements
you
please
but
go
it
be
like
a
sort
of
vacation
to
you
you
need
one
and
i
make
it
worth
your
while
take
clara
with
you
she
like
california
now
do
say
no
it
important
straighten
it
out
as
quick
as
you
can
and
the
minute
it
is
straight
borrow
that
money
on
it
and
send
it
on
taylor
thoughtfully
tapped
his
palm
with
the
edge
of
his
right
he
said
at
last
cried
orde
rising
and
holding
out
his
hand
he
descended
the
dark
stairs
to
the
street
where
he
turned
down
toward
the
river
there
he
sat
on
a
pile
for
nearly
an
hour
quite
oblivious
to
the
keen
wind
of
latter
november
which
swept
up
over
the
scum
ice
from
the
lake
at
length
he
hopped
down
and
made
his
way
to
the
office
of
the
welton
lumber
here
welton
he
demanded
abruptly
when
he
had
reached
that
operator
private
office
much
of
a
cut
are
you
going
to
make
this
year
twenty
million
replied
welton
figuring
on
the
drive
said
orde
nodding
a
farewell
he
had
the
team
harnessed
and
assuming
his
coat
drove
to
the
offices
of
all
the
men
owning
timber
up
and
down
the
river
when
he
had
collected
his
statistics
he
returned
to
his
desk
where
he
filled
the
backs
of
several
envelopes
with
his
characteristically
minute
figures
at
the
close
of
his
calculations
he
nodded
his
head
vigorously
several
times
he
called
across
to
his
partner
going
to
cut
that
whole
forty
million
we
have
newmark
did
not
turn
after
a
moment
his
dry
expressionless
voice
came
back
thought
that
we
figured
that
as
a
did
but
i
going
to
clean
up
the
whole
thing
this
you
think
you
can
do
it
thing
replied
orde
then
under
his
breath
and
quite
to
himself
he
added
got
to
xxxvii
the
duel
had
now
come
to
grapples
orde
was
fighting
for
his
very
life
the
notes
given
by
newmark
and
orde
would
come
due
by
the
beginning
of
the
following
summer
before
that
time
orde
must
be
able
to
meet
them
personally
or
as
by
the
agreement
with
newmark
his
stock
in
the
boom
company
would
be
turned
in
to
the
firm
this
would
of
course
spell
nearly
a
total
loss
of
it
as
far
as
orde
was
concerned
the
chief
anxiety
under
which
the
riverman
laboured
however
was
the
imminent
prospect
of
losing
under
the
mortgage
all
the
northern
peninsula
timber
he
had
thought
that
the
firm
would
be
able
to
step
in
for
its
redemption
even
if
he
personally
found
himself
unable
to
meet
the
obligation
three
hundred
million
feet
would
seem
to
be
too
important
a
matter
to
let
go
under
so
small
a
mortgage
now
as
the
time
approached
he
realised
that
if
he
could
not
pay
the
notes
the
firm
would
certainly
be
unable
to
do
so
what
with
the
second
mortgage
due
two
years
later
and
to
be
met
by
newmark
with
the
outstanding
obligations
with
the
new
enterprise
of
the
vessels
ordered
from
duncan
mcleod
newmark
and
orde
would
be
unable
to
raise
anything
like
the
necessary
amount
to
his
personal
anxieties
orde
added
a
deep
and
bitter
at
having
involved
his
partner
in
what
amounted
to
a
total
loss
spurred
doubly
by
these
considerations
then
he
fell
upon
the
woods
work
with
unparalleled
ferocity
a
cut
and
sale
of
the
forty
million
feet
remaining
of
the
firm
holdings
together
with
the
tolls
to
be
collected
for
driving
the
river
that
spring
would
if
everything
went
right
and
no
change
in
the
situation
took
place
bring
orde
through
the
venture
almost
literally
by
skin
of
his
to
cut
forty
million
feet
even
in
these
latter
days
of
improvements
then
unknown
would
be
a
task
to
strain
to
the
utmost
every
resource
of
energy
pluck
equipment
and
organisation
in
the
operators
on
the
river
laughed
over
an
evident
madness
nevertheless
orde
accomplished
the
task
to
be
sure
he
was
largely
helped
by
a
favourable
winter
the
cold
weather
came
early
and
continued
late
freezing
preceded
the
snow
which
was
deep
enough
for
good
travoying
and
to
assure
abundant
freshet
water
in
the
spring
but
not
too
deep
to
interfere
with
the
work
orde
increased
his
woods
force
and
contrary
to
his
custom
he
drove
them
mercilessly
he
was
that
winter
his
own
and
lived
constantly
in
the
woods
the
rough
red
had
charge
of
the
banking
where
his
aggressive
brutal
personality
kept
the
rollways
free
from
congestion
for
congestion
there
means
delay
in
unloading
the
sleighs
and
that
in
turn
means
a
drag
in
the
woods
work
near
the
skidways
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
tom
north
and
tim
nolan
and
johnny
sims
and
jim
denning
were
foremen
back
in
the
forest
every
one
had
an
idea
more
or
less
vague
that
the
old
fellow
had
his
back
to
the
wall
late
into
the
night
the
rude
torches
made
quite
simply
from
brown
stone
jugs
full
of
oil
and
with
wicks
in
their
necks
cast
their
flickering
glare
over
the
ice
of
the
and
though
generally
in
that
part
of
michigan
the
thaws
begin
by
the
first
or
second
week
in
march
this
year
zero
weather
continued
even
to
the
eighth
of
april
when
the
drive
started
far
up
toward
headwaters
the
cut
was
banked
for
miles
along
the
stream
forty
million
feet
of
it
to
the
last
timber
the
strain
over
orde
slept
the
clock
around
and
awoke
to
the
further
but
familiar
task
of
driving
the
river
he
was
very
tired
but
his
spirit
was
at
peace
as
always
after
the
event
he
looked
back
on
his
anxieties
with
a
faint
amusement
over
their
futility
from
taylor
he
had
several
communications
the
lawyer
confessed
himself
baffled
as
to
the
purpose
and
basis
of
the
land
office
investigation
the
whole
affair
appeared
to
be
tangled
in
a
maze
of
technicalities
and
a
snarl
of
which
it
would
take
some
time
to
unravel
in
the
meantime
taylor
was
enjoying
himself
and
was
almost
extravagant
in
his
delight
over
the
climate
and
attractions
of
southern
california
orde
did
not
much
care
for
this
delay
he
saw
his
way
clear
to
meeting
his
obligations
without
the
necessity
of
hypothecating
the
california
timber
and
was
the
better
pleased
for
it
with
the
of
spring
he
started
confidently
with
the
largest
drive
in
the
history
of
the
river
a
matter
of
over
two
hundred
million
feet
this
tremendous
mass
of
timber
moved
practically
in
three
sections
the
first
and
smallest
comprised
probably
thirty
millions
it
started
from
the
lowermost
rollways
on
the
river
drove
rapidly
through
the
more
unobstructed
reaches
and
was
early
pocketed
above
monrovia
in
the
company
distributing
booms
the
second
and
largest
section
of
a
hundred
million
came
from
the
main
river
and
its
largest
tributaries
it
too
made
a
safe
drive
and
was
brought
to
rest
in
the
main
booms
and
in
a
series
of
temporary
or
emergency
booms
built
along
the
right
bank
and
upstream
from
the
main
works
the
third
section
containing
a
remainder
of
about
seventy
million
had
by
the
of
june
reached
the
slack
water
above
the
city
of
redding
xxxviii
the
morning
of
june
dawned
clear
orde
was
early
on
the
road
before
the
heat
of
the
day
he
drove
his
buckboard
rapidly
over
the
twelve
miles
that
separated
his
home
from
the
distributing
booms
for
he
wanted
at
once
to
avoid
the
heat
of
the
first
sun
and
to
arrive
at
the
commencement
of
the
day
work
after
a
glance
at
the
river
he
entered
the
tiny
office
and
set
about
the
examination
of
the
tally
sheets
left
by
the
foreman
while
he
was
engaged
in
this
checking
the
foreman
tom
north
entered
river
rising
a
he
remarked
conversationally
as
he
reached
for
the
second
set
of
tally
boards
crazy
muttered
orde
without
looking
up
clear
as
a
bell
and
there
have
been
no
rains
reported
from
rising
a
little
just
the
same
insisted
north
going
out
an
hour
later
orde
having
finished
his
clerical
work
walked
out
over
the
booms
the
water
certainly
had
risen
and
considerably
at
that
a
decided
current
sucked
through
the
interstices
in
the
piling
the
penned
logs
moved
uneasily
should
think
it
was
rising
said
orde
to
himself
as
he
watched
the
slowly
moving
water
wonder
what
up
it
ca
be
merely
those
rains
three
days
he
called
one
of
the
younger
boys
to
him
jimmy
powers
by
name
jimmy
said
he
one
of
these
piles
and
keep
track
of
how
fast
the
water
for
some
time
the
river
remained
stationary
then
resumed
its
slow
increase
orde
shook
his
head
do
like
june
floods
he
told
tom
north
fellow
can
understand
an
ordinary
spring
freshet
and
knows
about
how
far
it
will
go
but
these
summer
floods
are
so
confounded
mysterious
i
ca
figure
out
what
struck
the
old
stream
unless
they
having
almighty
heavy
rains
up
near
by
three
in
the
afternoon
jimmy
powers
reported
a
rise
since
morning
of
six
inches
the
current
had
proportionately
increased
in
power
said
orde
to
the
old
riverman
going
to
send
marsh
down
for
the
and
some
cable
the
barge
company
has
some
fifteen
inch
north
laughed
in
blazes
do
you
expect
to
do
with
that
he
inquired
may
need
them
orde
stated
with
conviction
safe
enough
now
and
probably
will
continue
so
but
i
ca
afford
to
take
chances
if
those
logs
ever
break
through
they
go
on
out
to
lake
michigan
and
there
they
would
be
worth
the
tom
north
stared
at
his
principal
in
surprise
a
mighty
long
chance
he
commented
knew
you
to
come
so
near
croaking
before
this
drive
goes
out
it
surely
busts
me
replied
orde
i
not
taking
even
long
captain
marsh
returning
with
the
sprite
brought
an
evening
paper
and
news
from
the
telegraph
offices
a
cloudburst
in
the
china
creek
district
followed
by
continued
heavy
rains
was
responsible
for
the
increased
water
the
papers
mentioned
this
only
incidentally
and
in
explanation
their
columns
were
filled
with
an
account
of
the
big
log
jam
that
had
formed
above
the
iron
railroad
bridge
the
planing
booms
had
given
way
under
pressure
and
the
contents
had
piled
down
stream
against
the
buttresses
before
steps
could
be
taken
to
clear
the
way
the
head
of
the
drive
hurried
by
the
excess
water
had
piled
in
on
top
immediately
a
jam
formed
increasing
in
weight
each
moment
until
practically
the
entire
third
section
had
piled
up
back
of
the
bridge
the
papers
occupied
themselves
with
the
picturesque
side
of
the
affair
none
expressed
any
anxiety
as
to
the
bridge
it
was
a
new
structure
each
of
whose
bents
weighed
over
a
hundred
tons
a
fall
of
a
few
inches
only
would
suffice
to
lock
the
jam
solidly
thus
relieving
whatever
pressure
the
mass
exerted
against
the
iron
bridge
that
the
water
would
shortly
go
down
was
of
course
inevitable
at
this
time
of
year
it
would
be
a
big
jam
for
the
rivermen
to
break
however
you
think
you
go
up
there
asked
north
orde
shook
his
head
in
a
nice
pickle
he
acknowledged
nolan
in
charge
and
will
do
his
best
i
think
we
may
have
troubles
of
our
own
right
here
at
he
slept
that
night
at
the
booms
the
water
contrary
to
all
expectation
rose
steadily
by
morning
it
had
crept
so
far
up
the
piles
that
there
began
to
be
danger
that
it
would
overflow
their
tops
in
that
case
of
course
the
logs
in
the
booms
would
also
run
out
it
time
we
did
a
little
work
remarked
orde
he
set
a
crew
of
men
to
raising
the
height
of
the
piling
by
tying
logs
firmly
to
the
bolted
timbers
atop
this
would
take
care
of
an
extra
two
feet
of
water
a
two
feet
beyond
all
previous
records
another
crew
stretched
the
fifteen
inch
manilla
cables
across
the
field
of
logs
in
order
to
segregate
them
into
several
units
of
mass
and
so
prevent
them
from
piling
up
at
the
end
of
the
enclosure
the
began
to
drop
its
hammer
at
spots
of
weakness
in
spite
of
the
accelerated
current
and
the
increased
volume
of
the
river
everything
was
soon
shipshape
and
safe
all
right
now
said
orde
only
thing
i
a
little
uneasy
about
is
those
confounded
temporary
booms
upstream
still
they
all
right
unless
they
get
to
piling
up
then
we
have
to
see
what
we
can
do
to
hold
them
i
think
as
soon
as
the
driver
is
through
down
at
the
sorting
end
she
better
drive
a
few
clumps
of
piles
to
strengthen
the
swing
when
it
is
shut
then
if
the
logs
pile
down
on
us
from
above
we
can
hold
them
about
two
hours
later
the
moved
up
the
swing
was
opened
and
the
men
began
to
drive
clumps
of
piles
in
such
a
position
as
to
strengthen
the
swing
when
the
latter
should
be
shut
it
was
a
slow
job
each
pile
had
to
be
taken
from
the
raft
at
the
stern
of
the
scow
erected
in
the
and
pounded
into
place
by
the
heavy
hammer
raised
and
let
drop
in
the
derrick
at
the
bow
long
before
the
task
was
finished
the
logs
in
the
temporary
booms
had
begun
to
slide
atop
one
another
to
cross
and
tangle
until
at
last
the
river
bed
inside
the
booms
was
filled
with
a
jam
of
formidable
dimensions
from
beneath
it
the
water
boiled
in
eddies
orde
looking
at
it
roused
himself
to
sudden
activity
a
move
on
he
advised
captain
aspinwall
of
the
driver
that
jam
breaks
on
us
we
want
to
be
ready
and
if
it
do
break
before
you
get
this
swing
strengthened
maybe
we
can
hold
her
where
she
is
no
earthly
doubt
that
those
boom
piles
will
never
stand
up
when
they
get
the
full
pressure
of
the

departed
up

a
tour
of
inspection
from
which
he
returned
almost
immediately
up

up
he
cried
ca
last
much
longer
indeed
even
to
the
men
on
the
evidences
of
the
pressure
sustained
by
the
slender
boom
piles
were
not
wanting
above
the
steady
gurgle
of
the
water
and
the
intermittent
puffing
and
other
noises
of
the
work
they
could
hear
a
creaking
and
groaning
of
timbers
full
of
portent
to
those
who
could
read
the
signs
the
driver
crew
laboured
desperately
hoisting
the
piles
into
the
carriage
tripping
the
heavy
hammer
sending
it
aloft
again
binding
feverishly
the
clumps
of
piles
together
by
means
of
cables
each
man
worked
with
an
eye
over
his
shoulder
fearful
of
the
power
that
menaced
him
two
of
the
clumps
had
been
placed
and
bound
a
third
was
nearly
finished
when
suddenly
with
a
crack
and
a
roar
the
upper
booms
gave
way
projecting
their
logs
upon
the
opening
and
the
driver
the
half
dozen

of
the
crew
caught
utterly
unaware

of
the
half

had
been
receiving

an
hour

scattered
by
the
winds
of
a
panic

themselves
on
their
faces

come
over
to
tell
you
what
to
do
expect
me
to
work
my
driver
under
the
face
of
that
jam
cried
the
captain
snapped
orde
wheeling
me
said
aspinwall
positively
know
when
i
got
enough
the
matter
asked
orde
is
safe
replied
the
captain
i
do
intend
to
risk
my
men
or
my
orde
stood
for
a
moment
then
with
a
snort
of
anger
he
leaped
to
the
deck
seized
the
man
by
the
neck
and
thrust
him
bodily
over
the
side
to
the
bank
you
skunk
he
roared
go
over
in
the
middle
of
that
lot
and
lie
down
on
your
face
and
see
if
you
feel
safe
there
get
out
the
whole
pack
of
you

in
charge
here
captain
aspinwall
picked
himself
up
his
face
red
with
anger
off
my
driver
he
snarled
that
man
orde
seized
a
short
heavy
bar
driver
is
requisitioned
said
he
out
i
have
time
to
fool
with
you
i
got
to
save
my
they
hesitated
and
while
they
did
so
tom
north
and
some
others
of
the
crew
came
running
across
the
jam
a
cable
to
the
winch
orde
shouted
at
these
as
soon
as
they
were
within
hearing
get
marsh
up
here
with
the
sprite
we
got
to
get
he
paid
no
more
attention
to
the
ejected
crew
the
latter
overawed
by
the
rivermen
who
now
gathered
in
full
force
took
the
part
of
spectators
a
few
minutes
hard
work
put
the
driver
afloat
fortunately
its
raft
of
piles
had
not
become
detached
in
the
upheaval
said
orde
briskly
to
north
know
the
business
pick
out
your
crew
and
take
in
ten
seconds
of
time
the
situation
had
changed
from
one
of
comparative
safety
to
one
of
extreme
gravity
the
logs
broken
loose
from
the
upper
temporary
booms
now
jammed
against
the
swing
and
against
the
other
logs
already
filling
the
main
booms
already
the
pressure
was
beginning
to
tell
as
the
water
banked
up
behind
the
mass
the
cables
tightened
slowly
but
mightily
some
of
the
piles
began
to
groan
and
rub
one
against
the
other
here
and
there
a
log
deliberately
above
the
level
orde
took
charge
of
the
situation
in
its
entirety
as
a
general
might
he
set
north
immediately
to
driving
clumps
each
of
sixteen
piles
bound
to
solidity
by
chains
and
so
arranged
in
angles
and
slants
as
to
direct
the
enormous
pressure
toward
either
bank
thus
splitting
the
power
the
small
driver
owned
by
the
boom
company
drove
similar
clumps
here
there
and
everywhere
that
need
arose
or
weakness
developed
men
opposed
to
the
weight
of
twenty
million
tons
of
logs
and
a
river
of
water
the
expedients
invented
by
determination
and
desperation
as
in
a
virulent
disease
the
symptoms
developed
rapidly
when
once
the
course
of
the
malady
was
assured
after
the
first
rush
when
the
upper
booms
broke
nothing
spectacular
occurred
steadily
and
relentlessly
the
logs
packed
close
together
down
to
the
very
bed
of
the
stream
pressed
outward
against
the
frail
defences
orde
soon
found
himself
forced
from
the
consideration
of
definite
plans
of
campaign
he
gave
over
formal
defences
and
threw
his
energies
to
saving
the
weak
places
which
rapidly
developed
by
the
most
tremendous
exertions
he
seemed
but
just
able
to
keep
even
so
closely
balanced
was
the
equilibrium
between
the
improvisation
of
defence
and
the
increase
of
pressure
behind
the
jam
that
it
seemed
as
if
even
a
moment
breathing
spell
would
bring
the
deluge
piles
quivered
bent
slowly
outward
immediately
before
the
logs
behind
them
could
stir
the
must
do
its
work
back
and
forth
darted
the
sprite
and
her
the
spray
towing
the
or
the
strings
of
piles
under
the
frowning
destruction
that
a
breath
might
loosen
the
crews
had
to
do
their
work
and
if
ever
that
breath
should
come
there
would
be
no
chance
for
escape
crushed
and
buried
the
men
and
their
craft
alike
would
be
borne
with
the
breaking
jam
to
an
unknown
grave
in
the
lake
every
man
knew
it
darkness
came
no
one
stopped
for
food
by
the
light
of
lanterns
the
struggle
went
on
doubly
terrifying
in
the
mystery
of
night
by
day
the
men
practised
in
such
matters
could
at
least
judge
of
the
probabilities
of
a
break
at
night
they
had
to
work
blindly
uncertain
at
what
moment
the
forces
they
could
not
see
would
cut
loose
to
overwhelm
them
morning
found
no
change
in
the
situation
the
water
rose
steadily
the
logs
grew
more
and
more
restive
the
defences
weaker
and
more
inadequate
orde
brought
out
steaming
pails
of
coffee
which
the
men
gulped
down
between
moments
no
one
thought
of
quitting
they
were
afire
with
the
flame
of
combat
and
were
set
obstinately
on
winning
even
in
the
face
of
odds
about
ten
they
were
reinforced
by
men
from
the
mills
downstream
the
owners
of
those
mills
had
no
mind
to
lose
their
logs
another
was
also
sent
up
from
the
government
work
without
this
assistance
the
jam
must
surely
have
gone
out
spectators
marvelled
how
it
held
as
it
did
the
mass
seemed
constantly
to
quiver
on
the
edge
of
motion
here
and
there
over
the
surface
of
the
jam
single
logs
could
be
seen
popping
suddenly
into
the
air
propelled
as
an
apple
seed
is
projected
from
between
a
boy
thumb
and
forefinger
some
of
the
cables
stretched
to
the
shore
parted
one
which
passed
once
around
an
oak
tree
before
reaching
its
shore
anchorage
actually
buried
itself
out
of
sight
in
the
hard
wood
bunches
of
piles
bent
twisted
or
were
cut
off
as
though
they
had
been
but
shocks
of
indian
corn
the
current
had
become
so
swift
that
the
tugs
could
not
hold
the
drivers
against
it
and
as
a
consequence
before
commencing
operations
special
mooring
piles
had
to
be
driven
each
minute
threatened
to
bring
an
end
to
the
jam
yet
it
held
and
without
rest
the
dogged
little
insects
under
its
face
toiled
to
gain
an
inch
on
the
waters
xxxix
all
that
day
and
the
next
night
the
fight
was
hand
to
hand
without
the
opportunity
of
a
breathing
space
then
orde
bareheaded
and
dishevelled
strung
to
a
high
excitement
but
cool
as
a
veteran
under
fire
began
to
be
harassed
by
annoyances
the
piles
provided
for
the
drivers
gave
out
newmark
left
ostensibly
to
purchase
more
he
did
not
return
tom
north
and
jim
denning
their
eyes
burning
deep
in
their
heads
for
lack
of
sleep
came
to
orde
holding
to
him
symbolically
their
empty
hands
more
piles
they
said
briefly
said
orde
with
equal
brevity
will
have
enough
here
shortly
in
the
meantime
get
north
and
his
friend
disappeared
taking
with
them
the
crews
of
the
drivers
and
the
two
tugs
after
an
interval
they
returned
towing
small
rafts
of
the
long
timbers
orde
did
not
make
any
inquiries
nor
until
days
later
did
he
see
a
copy
of
the
newspaper
telling
how
a
lawless
gang
of
rivermen
had
driven
away
the
railroad
men
and
stolen
the
property
these
piles
lasted
five
or
six
hours
tom
north
placed
and
drove
them
accurately
and
deliberately
quite
unmindful
of
the
constant
danger
a
cold
fire
seemed
to
consume
the
man
inflaming
his
courage
and
his
dogged
obstinacy
once
a
wing
of
the
jam
broke
suddenly
just
as
his
crew
had
placed
a
pile
in
the
carrier
the
scow
was
picked
up
whirled
around
carried
bodily
a
hundred
feet
and
deposited
finally
with
a
crash
the
instant
the
craft
steadied
and
even
before
any
one
could
tell
whether
or
no
the
danger
was
past
tom
cut
loose
the
hammer
and
drove
that
pile
put
you
in
that
carrier
to
be
drove
he
shouted
viciously
drove
you
be
if
we
are
goin
to
hell
when
the
spray
shouldered
the
scow
back
to
position
that
one
pile
was
left
standing
upright
in
the
channel
a
monument
to
the
blind
determination
of
the
man
fortunately
the
wing
break
carried
with
it
but
a
few
logs
but
it
sufficed
to
show
if
demonstration
were
needed
what
would
happen
if
any
more
serious
break
should
occur
orde
was
everywhere
long
since
he
had
lost
his
hat
and
over
his
forehead
and
into
his
eyes
the
strands
of
his
hair
whipped
tousled
and
unkempt
miles
and
miles
he
travelled
running
along
the
tops
of
the
booms
over
the
surface
of
the
jam
spying
the
weakening
places
and
hurrying
to
them
a
rescue
he
seemed
tireless
omnipresent
alive
to
every
need
it
was
as
though
his
personality
alone
held
in
correlation
these
struggling
forces
as
though
were
he
to
relax
for
an
instant
his
effort
they
would
burst
forth
with
the
explosion
of
energies
toward
noon
the
piles
gave
out
again
in
hell
is
newmark
exploded
orde
and
immediately
was
himself
again
controlled
and
resourceful
he
sent
north
and
a
crew
of
men
to
cut
piles
from
standing
timber
in
farm
wood
lots
near
the
river
them
out
with
your
winch
said
he
the
owners
object
stand
them
off
with
your
peavies
get
them
about
three
of
the
afternoon
the
lucy
belle
splattered
up
stream
from
the
village
carrying
an
excursion
to
see
the
jam
captain
simpson
brought
her
as
close
in
as
possible
the
waves
raised
by
her
awkward
and
her
clumsy
lines
surged
among
the
logs
and
piles
orde
looked
on
this
with
distrust
tell
him
to
pull
out
of
that
he
instructed
jimmy
powers
confounded
old
fool
ought
to
know
better
than
that
tell
him
dangerous
if
the
jam
goes
out
it
carry
him
to
kingdom
jimmy
powers
returned
from
his
interview
told
me
to
go
to
hell
he
said
shortly
he
did
snapped
orde
should
think
we
had
enough
without
that
old
idiot
with
the
short
nervous
leaps
of
a
suppressed
anger
he
ran
down
to
where
the
sprite
had
just
towed
the
number
one
driver
into
a
new
position
me
alongside
the
lucy
belle
he
told
marsh
but
simpson
in
a
position
of
importance
at
last
was
disinclined
to
listen
he
had
worn
his
blue
clothes
and
brass
buttons
for
a
good
many
years
in
charge
only
of
boxes
and
barrels
now
at
a
stroke
he
found
himself
commander
over
tenscore
people
likewise
at
fifty
cents
a
head
he
foresaw
a
good
thing
as
long
as
high
water
should
last
he
had
risen
nobly
to
the
occasion
for
he
had
even
hoisted
his
bunting
and
brought
with
him
the
local
brass
band
orde
brusque
in
his
desire
to
hurry
through
an
affair
of
minor
importance
rubbed
the
man
the
wrong
way
reckon
i
some
rights
on
this
river
captain
simpson
concluded
the
argument
i
ai
agoin
to
be
bulldozed
out
of
the
excursionists
typical
from
redding
holland
monrovia
and
muskegon
cheered
this
sentiment
and
jeered
at
orde
orde
nodded
briefly
said
he
to
his
captain
in
a
low
voice
a
crew
and
take
them
in
charge
run
as
soon
as
the
tug
touched
the
piling
he
was
off
and
away
paying
no
further
attention
to
a
matter
already
settled
captain
marsh
called
a
dozen
rivermen
to
him
laid
the
sprite
alongside
the
lucy
belle
and
in
spite
of
simpson
scandalised
protests
and
an
incipient
panic
among
the
passengers
thrust
aside
the
regular
crew
of
the
steamship
and
took
charge
quite
calmly
he
surveyed
the
scene
from
the
height
of
the
steamer
bridge
he
could
see
abroad
over
the
country
a
warm
june
sun
flooded
the
landscape
which
was
filled
with
the
peace
of
early
summer
the
river
seemed
to
flow
smoothly
and
quietly
enough
in
spite
of
the
swiftness
of
its
current
and
the
swollen
volume
of
its
waters
only
up
stream
where
the
big
jam
shrugged
and
groaned
did
any
element
jar
on
the
peace
of
the
scene
and
even
that
in
contrast
to
the
rest
of
the
landscape
afforded
small
hint
to
the
inexperienced
eye
of
the
imminence
of
a
mighty
destruction
captain
marsh
paid
little
attention
to
all
this
his
eye
swept
rapidly
up
and
down
where
the
banks
used
to
be
until
he
saw
a
cross
current
deeper
than
the
rest
sweeping
in
athwart
the
inundated
fields
he
swung
over
the
wheel
and
rang
to
the
for
half
speed
ahead
slowly
the
lucy
belle
answered
quite
calmly
captain
marsh
rammed
her
through
the
opening
and
out
over
the
cornfields
the
lucy
belle
was
a
typical
river
steamboat
built
light
in
the
draught
in
order
to
slide
over
the
numerous
shifting
bars
to
be
encountered
in
her
customary
business
when
captain
marsh
saw
that
he
had
hit
the
opening
he
rang
for
full
speed
and
rammed
the
poor
old
lucy
belle
hard
aground
in
about
a
foot
of
water
through
which
a
few
mournful
dried
cornstalks
were
showing
their
heads
then
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
sauntered
out
of
the
to
the
deck
if
you
want
to
picnic
he
told
the
astonished
and
frightened
excursionists
to
it
with
entire
indifference
to
the
water
he
vaulted
over
the
low
rail
and
splashed
away
the
rivermen
and
the
engineer
who
had
accompanied
him
lingered
only
long
enough
to
start
up
the
band
you
safe
as
a
cow
tied
to
a
brick
wall
said
the
rough
red
whose
appearance
alone
had
gone
far
toward
overawing
the
passengers
joyful
start
up
the
music
start
her
up
i
tell
you
the
band
hastily
began
to
squawk
very
much
out
of
time
and
somewhat
out
of
tune
right
grinned
the
rough
red
savagely
her
up
if
you
quit
before
i
get
back
to
work
i
come
back
and
take
you
they
waded
through
the
shallow
water
in
the
cornfield
after
them
wafted
the
rather
disorganised
strains
of
whoa
emma
captain
simpson
was
indulging
in
what
resembled
heat
apoplexy
after
a
time
the
lucy
crew
recovered
their
scattered
wits
sufficiently
to
transport
the
passengers
in
small
boats
to
a
point
near
the
county
road
whence
all
trudged
to
town
the
lucy
belle
grew
in
the
cornfield
until
several
weeks
later
when
time
was
found
to
pull
her
off
on
rollers
arrived
at
the
booms
captain
marsh
shook
the
loose
water
from
his
legs
right
sir
he
reported
to
orde
ran
ashore
orde
looked
up
brushing
the
hair
from
his
eyes
he
glanced
in
the
direction
of
the
cornfield
and
a
quick
grin
flickered
across
the
absorbed
expression
of
his
face
should
think
you
did
said
he
briefly
guess
that
end
the
excursion
business
now
take
number
two
up
below
the
swing
and
then
run
down
and
see
if
you
can
discover
tom
he
went
somewhere
after
piles
about
an
hour
down
river
the
various
mill
owners
were
busy
with
what
men
they
had
left
in
stringing
defences
across
the
river
in
case
orde
works
should
go
out
when
orde
heard
this
he
swore
vigourously
fools
he
spat
out
be
a
lot
better
off
helping
here
if
this
goes
out
their
little
booms
wo
amount
to
a
whiff
of
he
sent
word
to
that
effect
but
lacking
the
enforcement
of
his
personal
presence
his
messages
did
not
carry
conviction
and
the
owners
continued
to
labour
each
according
to
his
ideas
on
what
orde
clearer
vision
saw
to
be
a
series
of
almost
comical
futilities
however
welton
answered
the
summons
orde
hailed
his
coming
with
a
shout
want
a
dredge
he
yelled
as
soon
as
the
lumberman
was
within
distance
believe
we
can
relieve
the
pressure
somewhat
by
a
channel
into
steam
bayou
get
that
government
dredge
up
and
through
the
bayou
as
soon
as
you
right
said
welton
briefly
you
hold
her
got
to
hold
her
replied
orde
between
his
clenched
teeth
you
seen
newmark
where
in
hell
is
newmark
i
need
him
for
fifty
things
and
he
disappeared
off
the
face
of
the
earth
purdy
that
second
cable
she
snapped
a
strand
get
a
reinforcing
line
on
her
he
ran
in
the
direction
of
the
new
danger
without
another
thought
of
welton
by
the
late
afternoon
casual
spectators
from
the
countryside
had
gathered
in
some
number
the
bolder
or
more
curious
of
these
added
a
further
touch
of
anxiety
to
the
situation
by
clambering
out
over
the
jam
for
a
better

instructions
that
these

keep
off

but
in
spite
of
that
with
the
impertinent
perseverance
of
the
many
persisted
from
time
to
time
when
the
rivermen
were
too
busily
engaged
to
attend
to
them
in
venturing
out
where
they
were
not
only
in
danger
but
also
in
the
way
tom
north
would
have
none
of
this

his
if
a
man
was
not
actually
working
he
had
no
business
on

i
any
objections
to
your
grabbing
her
in
this
emergency
even
if
you
did
manhandle

surely
you
are
not
going

off
my

do
give
a

damn
who

north
sturdily
you

working
you
get
and
get
off
he
did
the
broad
deck
of
the
scow
was
a
tempting
point
from
which
to
survey
the
work
and
the
ugly
jam
and
the
water
boiling
angrily
and
the
dishevelled
maniacs
who
worked
doggedly
with
set
teeth
as
though
they
had
not
already
gone
without
two
nights
sleep
north
had
often
to
order
ashore
intruders
until
his
temper
shortened
to
the
vanishing
point
one
big
hulking
countryman
attempted
to
argue
the
point
north
promptly
knocked
him
overboard
into
the
shallow
water
between
the
driver
and
the
bank
he
did
not
rise
so
north
fished
for
him
in
the
most
way
with
a
boat
hook
threw
him
on
the
bank
unconscious
and
went
on
driving
piles
the
incident
raised
a
laugh
among
the
men
but
flesh
and
blood
has
its
limit
of
endurance
and
that
limit
was
almost
reached
orde
heard
the
first
premonitions
of
reaction
in
the
mild
grumblings
that
arose
he
knew
these
men
well
from
his
long
experience
with
them
although
the
need
for
struggle
against
the
tireless
dynamics
of
the
river
was
as
insistent
as
ever
although
it
seemed
certain
that
a
moment
cessation
of
effort
would
permit
the
enemy
an
irretrievable
gain
he
called
a
halt
on
the
whole
work
said
he
irrelevantly
have
a
smoke
he
set
the
example
by
throwing
himself
full
length
against
a
slanting
pile
and
most
leisurely
filling
his
pipe
the
men
stared
a
moment
then
followed
his
example
a
great
peace
of
evening
filled
the
sky
the
horizon
lay
low
and
black
against
the
afterglow
beneath
it
the
river
shone
like
silver
only
the
groaning
the
heave
and
shrugging
of
the
jam
and
the
low
threatening
gurgle
of
hurrying
waters
reminded
the
men
of
the
enemy
continued
activity
over
beyond
the
rise
of
land
that
lay
between
the
river
and
stearn
bayou
could
be
seen
the
cloud
of
mingled
smoke
and
steam
that
marked
the
activities
of
the
dredge
for
ten
minutes
they
rested
in
the
solace
of
tobacco
orde
was
apparently
more
at
ease
than
any
of
the
rest
but
each
instant
he
expected
to
hear
the
premonitory
crack
that
would
sound
the
end
of
everything
finally
he
yawned
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
and
got
to
his
feet
said
he
a
new
ring
in
his
voice
on
and
let
get
something
done
they
responded
to
a
man
xl
by
midnight
the
water
seemed
to
have
gone
down
slightly
half
the
crew
snatched
a
little
sleep
for
several
hours
more
the
issue
hung
aggravatingly
in
equilibrium
then
with
the
opening
of
the
channel
into
stearn
bayou
the
heaviest
pressure
was
relieved
for
the
moment
the
acute
danger
point
was
passed
orde
spent
the
next
two
days
in
strengthening
the
defences
the
men
were
able
to
take
their
quota
of
meals
and
of
sleep
merely
the
working
hours
were
longer
than
usual
orde
himself
slept
little
and
was
still
possessed
by
a
feverish
activity
the
flood
continued
at
about
the
same
volume
until
the
water
should
subside
the
danger
could
not
be
considered
completely
over
with
in
these
few
days
of
comparative
leisure
orde
had
time
to
look
about
him
and
to
receive
news
the
jam
had
been
successfully
held
at
the
iron
railroad
bridge
above
redding
but
only
by
the
most
strenuous
efforts
braces
of
oak
beams
had
been
slanted
where
they
would
do
the
most
good
chains
strengthened
the
weaker
spots
and
on
top
of
all
ton
after
ton
of
railroad
iron
held
the
whole
immovably
nolan
had
enjoyed
the
advantage
of
a
jam
of
convenient
facilities
incident
to
a
large
city
and
of
an
aroused
public
sentiment
that
proffered
him
all
the
help
he
could
use
monrovia
little
village
that
it
was
had
not
grasped
the
situation
redding
saw
it
clearly
the
loss
of
the
timber
alone
representing
some
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
the
sawed
product
would
mean
failure
of
mill
companies
of
banks
holding
their
paper
and
so
of
firms
in
other
lines
of
business
and
besides
would
throw
thousands
of
men
out
of
employment
furthermore
what
was
quite
as
serious
should
the
iron
bridge
give
way
the
wooden
bridges
below
could
hardly
fail
to
go
out
railroad
communication
between
eastern
and
western
michigan
would
be
entirely
cut
off
for
a
season
industry
of
every
description
would
be
practically
paralysed
therefore
nolan
had
all
the
help
he
required
every
device
known
was
employed
to
strengthen
the
jam
for
only
a
few
hours
was
the
result
in
doubt
then
as
the
clarion
jubilantly
expressed
it
a
hundred
dollars
to
an
old
hat
she
holds
orde
received
all
this
with
satisfaction
but
with
a
slight
scepticism
a
floating
jam
and
it
gets
a
push
from

pointed
out

another

to
himself

when
he

just
how
bad

for
two
days
as
has
been

nothing
happened
then
orde
decided
to
break
out
a
channel
through
the
jam
itself
this
was
a
necessary
preliminary
to
getting
the
logs
in
shape
for
distribution
an
opening
was
made
in
the
piles
and
the
rivermen
with
and
peavy
began
cautiously
to
dig
their
way
through
the
tangled
timbers
the
government
which
had
finally
been
sent
up
from
below
began
placing
five
extra
booms
at
intervals
down
stream
to
capture
the
drift
as
fast
as
it
was
turned
loose
from
the
mills
and
private
booms

came
to
assist
in
the
labour
the
troubles
appeared
to
be

over

answered
the
eager
exclamations
of

crowded
around
him
all

the

even
if

the

an
air
of
profound
discouragement

fallen

now

been
gained
by

of
narrow

still
against

in

the
strength
that

pushed
aside
redding

augmented
by
the
momentum
of
a
powerful
current
it
was
small
wonder
they
gave
up
already
the
news

spreading
among
the
workers
on
the
jams
as

shouted
to
man
each
shouldered
his
peavy
and
came
running
ashore
eager
question
on
his
lips

saw
the
government
driver
below
casting
loose
from
her
moorings
a
moment
later
her
tug
towed
her
away
to

side
bayou
of

of
the
expected
rush
to

nerve
with

swept
them
with
his
eye
then
turned
away
from

with
a
gesture
of
despair
they
watched
him
gravely
and
silently
no

old
carlin
sure
death

laughed
bitterly
right
sure
death
then
there
a

in

tackle
this
sort
of
sure
death
with

in
a
breath
cried

leisurely
confidence

situated
around

the
stern
of
the
driver
if
you

to
he
told
north
who
had
charge
go
all

and
the
line
will
probably
swing
you
around
out
of
danger
we
on
the

get
out
as
best
we
the
opening
was
to
be
closed
by
piles
driven
in
groups
of
sixteen
bound
together
by
chains
the

to

on

the
tug
and
her
consort
nosed
up
through
the
boiling
water
rising
already
said
orde
to
marsh
watching
the
water
around
the
piles
and
that
jam
going
out
before
many
minutes
supplemented
the
tugboat
captain
grimly
both
these
statements
were
only
too
true
although
not
fifteen
minutes
before
the
jam
had
lain
locked
in
perfect
safety
now
the
slight
rise
of
the
waters
had
lifted
and
loosened
the
mass
until
it
rose
fairly
on
the
quiver
fast
orde
called
to
the
men
on
the
we
can
close
the
opening
before
those
redding
logs
hit
us
we
may
be
able
to
turn
them
into

new
he
did
not
add
that
if
the
opening
were
not
closed
before
the
jam
broke
as
break
it
would
in
a
very
few
moments
the
probabilities
were
that
both
and
tug
would
be
destroyed
every
man
knew
that
already
tom
north
ordered
a
pile
placed
in
the
carriage
the
hammer
descended
at
once
like
battering
rams
logs
began
to
shoot
up
from
the
depths
of
the
river
end
foremost
all
about
them
these
timbers
were
projected
with
tremendous
force
leaping
sometimes
half
their
length
above
the
surface
of
the
water
if
any
of
them
had
hit
either
the
tug
or
the
squarely
it
would
have
stove
and
sunk
the
craft
fortunately
this
did
not
happen
but
marsh
hastily
towed
the
scow
back
to
a
better
position
the
pile
had
evidently
been
driven
into
the
foot
of
the
jam
itself
thus
loosening
timbers
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
the
work
went
forward
as
rapidly
as
possible
four
times
the
jam
shrugged
and
settled
but
four
times
it
paused
on
the
brink
of
discharge
three
of
the
clumps

been
placed
and
bound
and
fifteen

smoothly
to

and
fell
a
half
dozen
times
more
it
ripped
then
without
delay
the
heavy
chains
were
thrown
around
the

the
steam

to

johnny

the
driver
dropped
back
with
the
current
and
around
the
bend
where
she
was
snubbed
by
the
safety
line
already
mentioned
immediately
the
tug
churned
forward
to
accomplish
the
last
duty
that
of
binding
the
defences
together
by
means
of
chains
and
cables
two
men
leaped
to
the
floating
booms

moved
her
fore
and
aft

the
rough
red

about

assistant
to

this
one
jimmy
said
he
aboard
the

all
was
tense
preparation

grasped
alertly
the
spokes
of
the
wheel
in
the
harvey
his
hand
on
the
throttle

ready
to
throw
her
wide
open
at
the
signal
armed
with
sharp
axes
two
men
prepared
to
cut
the
mooring
lines
on
a
sign
from
the
rough
red

watched
his
upraised
hand
when
it
should
descend
their
axes

fall
out
the
rough
red
warned
orde
who
was
methodically
tying
the
last
cumbersome
knot
getting
ready
orde
folded
the
knot
over
without
reply
up
stream
the
jam
creaked
groaned
settled
deliberately
forward
cutting
a
clump
of
piles
like
straw
coming
cried
the
rough
red
me
every
second
you
can
said
orde
without
looking
up
he
was
just
making
the
last
turns
the
mass
toppled
slowly
fell
into
the
swift
current
and
leaped
with
a
roar
the
rough
red
watched
with
attention
he
cried
at
last
and
his
right
arm
descended
with
the
shout
and
the
motion
several
things
happened
simultaneously
orde
leaped
blindly
for
the
rail
where
he
was
seized
and
dragged
aboard
by
the
rough
red
the
axes
fell
marsh
whirled
over
the
wheel
harvey
threw
open
his
throttle
the
tug
sprang
from
its
leash
like
a
hound
and
behind
the
barrier
the
logs
tossing
and
tumbling
the
white
spray
flying
before
their
onslaught
beat
in
vain
against
the
barrier
like
raging
wild
beasts
whose
prey
has
escaped
call
said
orde
briefly
you
replied
marsh
neither
referred
to
the
tug
escape
but
to
the
fortunate
closing
of
the
opening
xli
orde
now
took
steps
to
deflect
into
the
channel
recently
dredged
to
stearn
bayou
the
mass
of
the
logs
racing
down
stream
from
redding
he
estimated
that
he
had
still
two
hours
or
so
in
which
to
do
the
work
in
this
time
he
succeeded
by
the
severest
efforts
in
establishing
a
rough
shunt
into
the
new
channel
the
logs
would
come
down
running
free
only
the
shock
of
their
impact
against
the
tail
of
the
jam
already
formed
was
to
be
feared
orde
hoped
to
be
able
to
turn
the
bulk
of
them
aside
this
at
first
he
succeeded
in
doing
and
very
successfully
as
affecting
the
pressure
on
the
jam
below
the
first
logs
came
scattering
then
in
a
little
while
the
surface
of
the
river
was
covered
with
them
they
shouldered
each
other
aside
in
their
eagerness
to
outstrip
the
rushing
water
finally
they
crowded
down
more
slowly
hardly
able
to
make
their
way
against
the
choking
of
the
river
banks
but
putting
forth
in
the
very
effort
to
proceed
a
tremendous
power
to
the
crew
working
in
the
channel
dredged
through
to
steam
bayou
the
affair
was
that
of
driving
a
rather
narrow
and
swift
stream
only
exaggerated
by
quick
and
skilful
work
they
succeeded
in
keeping
the
logs
in
motion
a
large
proportion
of
the
timbers
found
their
way
into
the
bayou
those
that
continued
on
down
the
river
could
hardly
have
much
effect
on
the
jam
the
work
was
breathless
in
its
speed
from
one
to
another
panting
man
the
logs
were
handed
on
as
yet
only
the
advance
of
the
big
jam
had
arrived
at
the
dredged
channel

looked
about
him
and
realised
this

this
up

the
main
body
hits

panted
to
his
neighbour
jim
denning
have
to
do
some
more
he
made
a
rapid
excursion
to
the
boom
camp
whence
he
returned
with
thirty
or
forty
of
the
men
who
had
given
up
work
on
the
jam
below
boys
said
he
can
at
least
keep
these
logs
moving
in
this
channel
for
a
couple
of
hours
this
is
he
spoke
quite
without
sarcastic
intent
but
the
rivermen
already
over
their
first
panic
looked
at
each
other
a
trifle
shamefacedly
tie
into
her
wherever
you
say
said
one
big
fellow
you
fellows
are
going
back
to
the
jam
i
with
two
or
three
more
volunteered
the
remainder
said
nothing
but
in
silence
took
charge
of
the
dredged
channel
orde
and
his
men
now
returned
to
the
jam
where
on
the
the
tugs
and
the
booms
they
set
methodically
to
strengthening
the
defences
as
well
as
they
were
able
holding
strong
and
dandy
said
orde
to
tom
north
examining
critically
the
clumps
of
piles
channel
helps
a
lot
in
more
ways
than
one
it
takes
an
awful
lot
of
water
out
of
the
river
as
long
as
those
fellows
keep
the
logs
moving
i
really
believe
we
all
but
shortly
the
water
began
to
rise
again
this
time
fairly
by
leaps
in
immediate
response
the
jam
increased
its
pressure
for
the
hundredth
time
the
frail
wooden
defences
opposed
to
millions
of
pounds
were
tested
to
the
very
extreme
of
their
endurance
the
clumps
of
piles
sagged
outward
the
network
of
chains
and
cables
tightened
and
tightened
again
drawing
ever
nearer
the
snapping
point
suddenly
almost
without
warning
the
situation
had
become
desperate
and
for
the
first
time
orde
completely
lost
his
poise
and
became
fluently
profane
he
shook
his
fist
against
the
menacing
logs
he
apostrophised
the
river
the
high
water
the
jam
the
deserters
newmark
and
his
illness
ending
finally
in
a
general
anathema
against
any
and
all
streams
logs
and
floods
then
he
stormed
away
to
see
if
anything
had
gone
wrong
at
the
dredged
channel
said
tom
north
got
the
old
man
real
good
and
mad
this
the
crew
went
on
driving
piles
stringing
cables
binding
chains
although
now
that
the
inspiration
of
orde
combative
spirit
was
withdrawn
the
labours
seemed
useless
futile
a
mere
filling
in
of
the
time
before
the
supreme
moment
when
they
would
be
called
upon
to
pay
the
sacrifice
their
persistence
and
loyalty
had
proffered
for
the
altar
of
and
the
invincibility
of
the
human
soul
at
the
dredged
channel
orde
saw
the
rivermen
standing
idle
and
with
anger
he
burst
upon
them
demanding
by
this
that
and
the
other
what
they
meant
then
he
stopped
short
and
stared
square
across
the
dredged
channel
and
completely
blocking
it
lay
a
single
span
of
an
iron
bridge
although
twisted
and
misshapen
it
was
still
intact
the
framework
of
its
overhead
retaining
its
shape
behind
it
the
logs
had
of
course
piled
up
in
a
jam
which
sinking
rapidly
to
the
bed
of
the
channel
had
dammed
back
the
water
in
hell
did
that
drop
from
cried
orde
down
on
top
the
jam
explained
a
riverman
have
come
way
from
redding
we
just
could
scare
her
out
of
orde
suddenly
fallen
into
a
cold
rage
stared
at
the
obstruction
both
fists
clenched
at
his
side
bad
boy
said
welton
at
his
elbow
do
take
it
too
hard
you
done
more
than
any
of
the
rest
of
us
could
and
we
all
losers
orde
looked
at
him
strangely
about
settles
it
repeated
welton
cried
orde
should
think
welton
smiled
quaintly
you
know
when
you
licked
hell
said
orde
just
begun
to
can
you

replied
welton
course
take
her
apart
bolt
by
bolt
and
nut
by
for
the
wrenches
then
snapped
orde
it
would
take
two
or
three
days
even
working
night
and
of
it
it
would
be
too
late
it
would
do
no
good
not
interrupted
orde
it
will
be
doing
something
anyway
look
here
welton
are
you
game
if
you
get
that
bridge
out
in
two
days
i
hold
the
ca
hold
that
jam
two
hours
let
alone
two
days
said
welton
decidedly
my
business
you
wasting
time
will
you
send
for
lanterns
and
wrenches
and
keep
this
crew
working
will
said
welton
do
during
the
next
two
days
the
old
scenes
were
all
relived
with
back
of
them
the
weight
of
the
struggle
that
had
gone
before
the
little
crew
worked
as
though
mad
excepting
them
no
one
ventured
on
the
river
for
to
be
caught
in
the
imminent
break
meant
to
die
old
spars
refuse
timbers
of
all
sorts
anything
and
everything
was
requisitioned
that
might
help
form
an
obstruction
above
or
below
water
piles
were
taken
where
they
could
be
found
farmer
trees
were
cut
down
pines
belonging
to
divers
and
protesting
owners
were
felled
and
sharpened
some
were
brought
in
by
rail
even
the
inviolate
government
supply
was
commandeered
the
railroad
company
had
a
fine
lot
which
with
remarkable
shortsightedness
and
lack
of
public
spirit
they
refused
to
sell
at
any
price
the
crew
took
them
by
force
once
captain
marsh
was
found
up
to
his
waist
in
water
himself
felling
the
trees
of
a
wood
and
dragging
them
to
the
river
by
a
cable
attached
to
the
winch
of
his
tug
night
followed
day
and
day
night
again
none
of
the
crews
realised
the
fact
the
men
were
caught
in
the
toils
of
a
labour
ceaseless
and
eternal
never
would
it
end
just
as
never
had
it
begun
always
were
they
to
handle
piles
steam
hammers
and
the
implements
of
their
trade
menaced
by
a
jam
on
the
point
of
breaking
wet
by
a
swollen
and
angry
flood
by
a
clear
calm
sky
or
by
the
twinkling
peaceful
stars
long
since
had
they
ceased
to
reckon
with
the
results
of
what
they
did
the
consequences
either
to
themselves
or
to
the
jam
mechanically
they
performed
their
labour
perhaps
the
logs
would
kill
them
perhaps
these
long
black
dripping
piles
they
drove
were
having
some
effect
on
the
situation
neither
possibility
mattered
then
all
at
once
as
though
a
faucet
had
been
turned
off
the
floods
slackened
opened
the
channel
said
orde
dully
his
voice
sounded
to
himself
very
far
away
suddenly
the
external
world
too
seemed
removed
to
a
distance
far
from
his
centre
of
consciousness
he
felt
himself
moving
in
strange
and
distorted
surroundings
he
heard
himself
repeating
to
each
of
a
number
of
wavering
gigantic
figures
the
talismanic
words
that
had
accomplished
the
dissolution
of
the
earth
for
himself
opened
the
at
last
he
felt
hard
planks
beneath
his
feet
and
shaking
his
head
with
an
effort
he
made
out
the
of
the
sprite
and
a
man
leaning
against
it
opened
the
channel
marsh
he
repeated
guess
that
be
then
quite
slowly
he
sank
to
the
deck
sound
asleep
welton
returning
from
his
labours
with
the
iron
bridge
and
the
jam
found
them
thus
men
slept
on
the
deck
of
the
tug
aboard
the
two
or
three
had
even
curled
up
in
the
crevices
of
the
jam
resting
in
the
arms
of
the
monster
they
had
subdued
xlii
when
newmark
left
in
the
early
stages
of
the
jam
he
gave
scant
thought
to
the
errand
on
which
he
had
ostensibly
departed
whether
or
nor
orde
got
a
supply
of
piles
was
to
him
a
matter
of
indifference
his
hope
or
rather
preference
was
that
the
jam
should
go
out
but
he
saw
clearly
what
orde
blinded
by
the
swift
action
of
the
struggle
was
as
yet
unable
to
perceive
even
should
the
riverman
succeed
in
stopping
the
jam
the
extraordinary
expenses
incidental
to
the
defence
and
to
the
subsequent
salvaging
untangling
and
sorting
would
more
than
eat
up
the
profits
of
the
drive
orde
would
then
be
forced
to
ask
for
an
extension
of
time
on
his
notes
on
arriving
in
monrovia
he
drove
to
his
own
house
to
mallock
he
issued
orders
to
the
office
and
tell
them
i
am
ill
said
he
then
hunt
up
heinzman
wherever
he
is
and
tell
him
i
want
to
see
him
he
did
not
trouble
to
send
word
directly
to
orde
up
river
but
left
him
to
be
informed
by
the
slow
process
of
filtration
through
the
bookkeepers
the
interim
of
several
hours
before
heinzman
appeared
he
spent
very
comfortably
in
his
easy
chair
dipping
into
a
small
volume
of
montaigne
at
length
the
german
was
announced
he
entered
rather
red
and
breathless
obviously
surprised
to
find
newmark
at
home
was
a
terrible
jam
said
he
mopping
his
brow
and
sinking
into
a
chair
got
lots
of
logs
in
newmark
dismissed
the
subject
with
an
abrupt
flip
of
his
unlighted
cigar
said
he
three
weeks
at
the
latest
orde
will
come
to
you
asking
for
a
renewal
of
the
notes
you
hold
against
our
firm
you
must
refuse
to
make
such
a
righdt
agreed
heinzman
probably
offer
you
higher
interest
you
must
refuse
that
then
when
the
notes
are
overdue
you
must
begin
suit
in
righdt
repeated
heinzman
a
little
restlessly
you
think
he
vill
hold
that
jam
newmark
shrugged
his
shoulders
swiftly
got
lots
of
logs
in
that
jam
if
that
jam
goes
out
i
vill
lose
a
heap
of
you
make
quite
a
heap
on
this
deal
said
newmark
carelessly
he
holds
it
said
heinzman
pausing
hate
like
the
mischief
to
joomp
on
said
newmark
decisively
what
he
there
he
looked
at
the
german
sharply
suppose
you
know
just
how
deep
you
in
this
i
ai
backing
oudt
negatived
heinzman
a
then
you
know
what
to
do
said
newmark
terminating
the
interview
xliii
little
by
little
the
water
went
down
the
pressure
already
considerably
relieved
by
the
channel
into
stearn
bayou
slackened
every
hour
orde
still
half
dazed
with
his
sleep
drove
back
along
the
marsh
road
to
town
his
faculties
were
still
in
the
torpor
that
follows
rest
after
exhaustion
the
warm
july
sun
the
breeze
from
the
lake
the
flash
of
light
from
the
roadside
water
these
were
all
he
had
room
for
among
his
perceptions
he
was
content
to
enjoy
them
and
to
anticipate
drowsily
the
keen
pleasure
of
seeing
carroll
again
in
the
rush
of
the
jam
he
had
heard
nothing
from
her
for
all
he
knew
she
and
bobby
might
have
been
among
the
spectators
on
the
bank
he
had
hardly
once
left
the
river
it
did
not
seem
to
him
strange
that
carroll
should
not
have
been
there
to
welcome
him
after
the
struggle
was
over
rarely
did
she
get
to
the
booms
in
ordinary
circumstances
this
episode
of
the
big
jam
was
after
all
nothing
but
part
of
the
day
work
to
orde
a
crisis
exaggerated
it
is
true
but
like
many
other
crises
a
man
must
meet
and
cope
with
on
the
river
there
was
no
reason
why
carroll
should
drive
the
twelve
miles
between
monrovia
and
the
booms
unless
curiosity
should
take
her
as
the
team
left
the
marsh
road
for
the
county
turnpike
past
the
mills
and
lumberyards
orde
shook
himself
fully
awake
he
began
to
review
the
situation
as
newmark
had
accurately
foreseen
he
came
almost
immediately
to
a
realisation
that
the
firm
would
not
be
able
to
meet
the
notes
given
to
heinzman
orde
had
depended
on
the
profits
from
the
season
drive
to
enable
him
to
make
up
the
necessary
amount
those
profits
would
be
greatly
diminished
if
not
wiped
out
entirely
by
the
expenses
both
regular
and
irregular
incurred
in
holding
the
jam
by
the
damage
suits
surely
to
be
brought
by
the
owners
of
the
piles
trees
and
other
supplies
and
materials
requisitioned
in
the
heat
of
the
campaign
and
by
the
extra
labour
necessary
to
break
out
the
jam
and
to
sort
the
logs
according
to
their
various
destinations
have
to
get
an
extension
of
time
said
orde
to
himself
course
joe
will
let
me
have
more
time
on
my
own
personal
note
to
the
firm
and
heinzman
surely
ought
to
i
saved
a
lot
of
his
logs
in
that
jam
and
if
he
does
want
to
i
guess
an
offer
of
a
little
higher
interest
will
fetch
ordinarily
the
state
of
affairs
would
have
worried
him
for
it
was
exactly
the
situation
he
had
fought
against
so
hard
but
now
he
was
too
wearied
in
soul
and
body
he
dismissed
the
subject
from
his
mind
the
horses
left
almost
to
themselves
lapsed
into
a
sleepy
jog
after
a
little
they
passed
the
bridge
and
entered
the
town
warm
spicy
odours
of
pine
disengaged
themselves
from
the
broken
shingles
and
sawdust
of
the
roadway
and
floated
upward
through
the
hot
sunshine
the
beautiful
maples
with
their
dense
shadows
threw
the
sidewalks
into
coolness
up
one
street
and
down
another
the
horses
took
their
accustomed
way
finally
they
pulled
up
opposite
the
orde
house
orde
hitched
the
horses
and
his
step
quickening
in
anticipation
sprang
up
the
walk
and
into
the
front
door
sweetheart
he
called
cheerily
the
echoes
alone
answered
him
he
cried
again
and
yet
again
with
a
growing
feeling
of
disappointment
that
carroll
should
happen
to
be
from
home
finally
a
door
opened
and
shut
in
the
back
part
of
the
house
a
moment
later
mary
the
irish
servant
girl
came
through
the
caught
sight
of
orde
threw
her
apron
over
her
head
and
burst
into
one
of
those
extravagant
demonstrations
of
grief
peculiar
to
the
of
her
class
orde
stopped
short
a
sinking
at
his
heart
is
it
mary
he
asked
very
quietly
but
the
girl
only
wept
the
louder
rocking
back
and
forth
in
a
fresh
paroxysm
of
grief
beside
himself
with
anxiety
orde
sprang
forward
to
shake
her
by
the
arm
to
shower
her
with
questions
these
elicited
nothing
but
broken
and
incoherent
fragments
concerning
missus
the
sad
day
me
lift
all
alone
with
bobby
me
heart
that
heavy
and
the
like
which
served
merely
to
increase
bewilderment
and
anxiety
at
this
moment
bobby
himself
appeared
from
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
orde
frantic
with
alarm
fell
upon
his
son
bobby
much
bewildered
by
all
this
pother
could
only
mumble
something
about
and
mamma
away
with
where
bobby
cried
orde
fairly
shaking
the
small
boy
by
the
shoulder
he
felt
like
a
man
in
a
bad
dream
trying
to
reach
a
goal
that
constantly
eluded
him
at
this
moment
a
calm
dry
voice
broke
through
the
turmoil
of
questions
and
exclamations
orde
looked
up
to
see
the
tall
angular
form
of
doctor
mcmullen
standing
in
the
doorway
all
right
said
the
doctor
in
answer
to
orde
agonised
expression
wife
was
exposed
to
smallpox
and
is
at
my
house
to
avoid
the
danger
of
spreading
contagion
she
is
not
having
thus
in
one
swift
decisive
sentence
covered
the
ground
of
anxiety
he
turned
to
the
sniffling
servant
said
he
sternly
ashamed
of
you
what
kind
of
an
exhibition
is
this
go
out
to
the
kitchen
and
cook
us
some
lunch
he
watched
her
depart
with
a
humourous
quirk
to
his
thin
lips
irish
he
said
with
a
scotchman
contempt
meant
to
head
you
off
before
you
got
home
but
i
missed
you
come
in
and
sit
down
and
i
tell
you
about
quite
sure
orde
is
well
insisted
orde
never
better
as
well
as
you
was
she
exposed
at
heinzman
you
know
or
perhaps
you
do
that
old
heinzman
is
the
worst
sort
of
crank
well
he
reaped
the
he
smallpox
asked
orde
i
thought
i
remembered
seeing
him
up
river
only
the
other
his
lord
knows
where
she
got
it
but
get
it
she
did
orde
happened
to
be
with
her
when
she
was
taken
with
the
fever
and
distressing
symptoms
that
begin
the
disease
as
a
neighbourly
deed
she
remained
with
the
girl
of
course
no
one
could
tell
it
was
smallpox
at
that
time
next
day
however
the
characteristic
rash
appeared
on
the
thighs
and
armpits
and
i
diagnosed
the
mcmullen
laughed
a
little
bitterly
you
ought
to
have
seen
them
run
servants
neighbours

they
all
skedaddled
and
you
could
have
driven
them
back

should
have
done
without
her
there

nobody
to

anything
at
all
as
soon
as
the
nurse
came
orde
gave
up
her
post
i
tell
you
cried
doctor
mcmullen
with
as
near
an
approach
to
enthusiasm
as
he
ever
permitted
himself
a
sensible
woman
none
of
your
twaddle
about
nursing
through
the
illness
and
all
that
when
her
usefulness
was
ended
she
knew
enough
to
step
aside
gracefully
there
was
not
much
danger
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
i
had
vaccinated
her
myself
you
know
last
year
but
she
might
take
the
contagion
and
she
wanted
to
spare
the
youngster
quite
right
so
i
offered
her
quarters
with
us
for
a
couple
of
long
ago
was
this

who
had
listened
with
a
warm
glow

right
in
when

him
out
and

with
her
or
near
her

mcmullen
a
man

been
vaccinated
continuous
exposure

infection
in
the
great
majority
of
luck
said
orde
thoughtfully
going
to
step
up
to
your
house
and
see

telephone
her
said
the
doctor
you
can
see
her
if
you
want
to
only
in
that
case
i
should
advise

remaining
away
from
bobby
until
we
see
how
things

said
orde
he
concluded
with
a
sigh
after
a
thought
suppose

better
stay
by
the

called

mcmullen
house
on
the
telephone

good
to
hear

promise
me
right
after
lunch
to
walk
up
past
the
house
so
i
can
see
you
i
wave
at
you
from
the
a
dear
brave
girl
and
i
proud
of

said
orde
there

no
danger
at
all
i
been
vaccinated
recently
and
somebody
had
to
take
care
of
poor
mina
until
we
could
get
help
bobby
xliv
after
lunch
orde
went
downtown
to
his
office
where
for
some
time
he
sat
idly
looking
over
the
mail
about
three
newmark
came
in
joe
said
orde
with
a
slight
constraint
to
hear
been
under
the
weather
you
do
look
very
sick
better
replied
newmark
briefly
is
my
first
bad
you
got
sick
just
at
that
time
said
orde
needed
i
hear
you
may
rest
assured
i
have
been
there
if
thing
said
orde
heartily
his
slight
resentment
dissipating
as
always
in
the
presence
of
another
personality
we
had
a
lively
time
you
bet
all
right
and
got
through
about
by
the
skin
of
our
he
arose
and
walked
over
to
newmark
desk
on
the
edge
of
which
he
perched
cost
us
considerable
and
it
going
to
cost
us
a
lot
more
i
have
to
get
an
extension
on
those
that
asked
newmark
quickly
orde
picked
up
a
paper
knife
and
turned
it
slowly
between
his
fingers
do
believe
i
be
able
to
meet
those
notes
so
many
things
have
happened
broke
in
newmark
firm
certainly
can
not
do
so
i
been
relying
on
your
assurance
that
you
would
take
them
up
personally
our
resources
are
all
tied
we
raise
anything
more
on
the
northern
peninsula
timber
asked
orde
ought
to
know
we
ca
cried
newmark
with
an
appearance
of
growing
excitement
last
thousand
we
borrowed
for
me
finishes
you
take
up
part
of
your
note
note
comes
due
in
rejoined
newmark
with
cold
disgust
expect
to
take
it
up
then
but
i
ca
until
then
i
had
expected
anything
like
do
get
hot
said
orde
vaguely
only
thought
that
northern
peninsula
stuff
might
be
worth
saving
any
way
we
could
figure
saving
snorted
newmark
whirling
in
his
chair
keep
your
hair
on
said
orde
on
whom
newmark
manner
was
beginning
to
have
its
effect
as
newmark
intended
it
should
have
my
boom
company
stock
as
security
for
the
loss
of
a
tract
like
the
upper
peninsula
timber
it
the
security
you
asked
for
and
suggested
said
orde
thought
you
surely
be
able
to
pay
it
retorted
newmark
now
secure
in
the
position
he
desired
to
take
that
of
putting
orde
entirely
in
the
wrong
i
expected
to
pay
it
and
i
pay
it
yet
rejoined
orde
do
think
heinzman
will
stand
in
his
own
light
rather
than
renew
the
he
seized
his
hat
and
departed
once
in
the
street
however
his
irritation
passed
as
was
the
habit
of
the
man
he
began
more
clearly
to
see
newmark
side
and
so
more
emphatically
to
blame
himself
after
all
when
he
got
right
down
to
the
essentials
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
that
newmark
anger
was
justified
for
his
own
private
ends
he
had
jeopardised
the
firm
property
more
of
a
business
man
might
have
reflected
that
newmark
as
financial
head
should
have
protected
the
firm
against
all
contingencies
should
have
seen
to
it
that
it
met
heinzman
notes
instead
of
tying
up
its
resources
in
unnecessary
ways
orde
own
delinquency
bulked
too
large
in
his
eyes
to
admit
his
perception
of
this
by
the
time
he
had
reached
heinzman
office
the
last
of
his
irritation
had
vanished
only
he
realised
clearly
now
that
it
would
hardly
do
to
ask
newmark
for
a
renewal
of
the
personal
note
on
which
depended
his
retention
of
his
boom
company
stock
unless
he
could
renew
the
heinzman
note
also
this
is
probably
what
newmark
intended
heinzman
he
asked
briefly
of
the
first
clerk
heinzman
is
at
home
ill
replied
the
bookkeeper
said
orde
he
drummed
on
the
black
walnut
rail
thoughtfully
the
notes
came
due
in
ten
days
bad
is
he
the
clerk
looked
up
curiously
say
probably
wo
be
back
for
a
long
time
it
smallpox
you
said
orde
who
in
charge
lambert
you
find
him
in
the
private
orde
passed
through
the
grill
into
the
inner
room
lambert
he
addressed
the
individual
seated
at
heinzman
desk
you
the
boss
eh
lambert
turned
showing
a
perfectly
round
face
ornamented
by
a
dot
of
a
nose
two
dots
of
eyes
set
rather
close
together
and
a
pursed
up
mouth
his
skin
was
very
brown
and
shiny
and
was
so
filled
by
the
flesh
beneath
as
to
take
the
appearance
of
having
been
inflated
i
the
boss
said
he
orde
dropped
into
a
chair
holds
some
notes
due
against
our
people
in
ten
days
said
he
came
in
to
see
about
their
renewal
can
you
attend
to
it
i
can
attend
to
it
replied
lambert
he
struck
a
bell
and
to
the
bookkeeper
who
answered
he
said
bring
me
those
newmark
and
orde
orde
heard
the
clang
of
the
safe
door
in
a
moment
the
clerk
returned
and
handed
to
lambert
a
long
manilla
envelope
lambert
opened
this
quite
deliberately
spread
its
contents
on
his
knee
and
assumed
a
pair
of
round
spectacles
for
thousand
dollars
with
interest
at
ten
per
cent
interest
paid
to
january
tenth
mortgage
deed
on
certain
lands
described
it
said
orde
lambert
looked
up
over
his
spectacles
want
to
renew
the
note
for
another
year
orde
explained
do
it
replied
lambert
removing
and
folding
the
glasses
not
heinzman
gave
me
especial
instructions
in
regard
to
this
matter
just
before
his
daughter
was
taken
sick
he
told
me
if
you
came
when
he
was
not
here
he
intended
to
go
to
chicago
yesterday
to
tell
you
he
would
not
not
asked
orde
blankly
do
know
i
give
him
twelve
per
cent
for
another
said
not
to
renew
even
if
you
offered
higher
you
happen
to
know
whether
he
intends
anything
in
regard
to
this
mortgage
instructed
me
to
begin
suit
in
foreclosure
do
understand
this
said
orde
lambert
shook
his
head
blandly
orde
thought
for
a
moment
your
telephone
he
demanded
abruptly
he
tried
in
vain
to
get
heinzman
at
his
house
finally
the
telephone
girl
informed
him
that
although
messages
had
come
from
the
stricken
household
she
had
been
unable
to
get
an
answer
to
any
of
her
numerous
calls
and
suspected
the
bell
had
been
removed
finally
orde
left
the
office
at
a
loss
how
to
proceed
next
lambert
secretly
overjoyed
at
this
opportunity
of
exercising
an
unaccustomed
and
autocratic
power
refused
to
see
beyond
his
instructions
heinzman
attitude
puzzled
orde
a
foreclosure
could
gain
heinzman
no
advantage
of
immediate
cash
orde
was
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
the
german
saw
here
a
good
opportunity
to
acquire
cheap
a
valuable
property
in
that
case
a
personal
appeal
would
avail
little
orde
tramped
out
to
the
end
of
the
pier
and
back
mulling
over
the
tangled
problem
he
was
pressed
on
all
sides
by
the
fatigue
after
his
tremendous
exertions
of
the
past
two
weeks
by
his
natural
uneasiness
in
regard
to
carroll
and
finally
by
this
new
complication
which
threatened
the
very
basis
of
his
prosperity
nevertheless
the
natural
optimism
of
the
man
finally
won
its
ascendency
the
year
of
redemption
on
that
mortgage
he
reminded
himself
may
be
able
to
do
something
in
that
time
i
do
know
just
what
he
added
whimsically
with
a
laugh
at
himself
he
became
grave
joe
he
said
is
pretty
tough
on
him
i
have
to
make
it
up
to
him
somehow
i
can
let
him
in
on
that
california
deal
when
the
titles
are
straightened
xlv
orde
did
not
return
to
the
office
he
felt
unwilling
to
face
newmark
until
he
had
a
little
more
thoroughly
digested
the
situation
he
spent
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
about
the
place
picking
up
the
tool
house
playing
with
bobby
training
duke
the
black
and
white
setter
dog
three
or
four
times
he
called
up
carroll
by
telephone
and
three
or
four
times
he
passed
mcmullen
house
to
shout
his
half
of
a
and
fragmentary
conversation
with
her
he
ate
solemnly
with
bobby
at
six
the
two
quite
subdued
over
the
vacant
chair
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
after
dinner
they
sat
on
the
porch
until
bobby
orde
put
his
small
son
to
bed
and
sat
talking
with
the
youngster
as
long
as
his
conscience
would
permit
then
he
retired
to
the
library
where
for
a
long
time
he
sat
in
twilight
and
loneliness
finally
when
he
could
no
longer
distinguish
objects
across
the
room
he
arose
with
a
sigh
lit
the
lamp
and
settled
himself
to
read
the
last
of
the
twilight
drained
from
the
world
and
the
window
panes
turned
a
burnished
black
through
the
sashes
sucked
a
warm
little
breeze
swaying
the
long
lace
curtains
back
and
forth
the
hum
of
and
the
chirping
of
crickets
and
came
with
it
one
by
one
the
fell
silent
gradually
there
descended
upon
the
world
the
deep
slumbrous
stillness
of
late
night
a
stillness
compounded
of
a
thousand
and
one
mysterious
little
noises
repeated
monotonously
over
and
over
until
their
identity
was
lost
in
accustomedness
occasionally
the
creak
of
timbers
or
the
sharp
scurrying
of
a
mouse
in
the
wall
served
more
to
accentuate
than
to
break
this
night
silence
orde
sat
lost
in
reverie
his
book
in
his
lap
at
stated
intervals
the
student
lamp
at
his
elbow
flared
slightly
then
burned
clear
again
after
a
swallow
of
satisfaction
in
its
reservoir
these
regular
replenishments
of
the
oil
supply
alone
marked
the
flight
of
time
suddenly
orde
leaned
forward
his
senses
at
the
keenest
attention
after
a
moment
he
arose
and
quietly
walked
toward
the
open
window
just
as
he
reached
the
casement
and
looked
out
a
man
looked
in
the
two
stared
at
each
other
not
two
feet
apart
lord
heinzman
cried
orde
in
a
guarded
voice
he
stepped
decisively
through
the
window
seized
the
german
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
one
side
are

he
demanded
heinzman
was
trembling
violently
as
though
from
a
chill
me
somewheres
he
whispered
hoarsely
quick

orde
his
anger
rising

coming
here
and
exposing
my
house
to
infection
heinzman
began
to
blubber
choked
shivered
all
over
and
cried
aloud

an
expression
of
the
greatest
agony

he
wrung
his
hands
dramatically
his
soft
pudgy
body
shaking
with
me
said
orde
briefly
he
led
the
way
around
the
house
to
the
tool
shed
here
he
lit
a
lantern
thrust
forward
one
nail
keg
and
sat
down
on
another
heinzman

down
on
the
nail
keg
almost
immediately
arose

up
and
down
two
or
three
times
and
resumed
his
seat
orde
looked
at
him
curiously
he
was
half
dressed
without
a
collar
his
thin
hair
unkempt
the
usual
bright
colour
of
his
cheeks
had
become
livid
and
the
flesh
ordinarily
firm
and
elastic
had
fallen
in
folds
and
wrinkles
his
eyes
burned
bright
as
though
from
some
internal
fire
a
great
restlessness
possessed
him
impulsively
orde
leaned
forward
to
touch
his
hand
it
was
dry
and
hot
is
it
heinzman
he
asked
quietly
fully
prepared
for
the
vagaries
of
a
half
delirium

said
he
suddenly
weary
orde
accompanied
him
down
the
street
the
german
was
again
with
the
fever
mumbling
about
his
daughter
the
notes
carroll
the
voices
that
had
driven
him
to
righteousness
by
some
manoeuvring
orde
succeeded
in
slipping
him
through
the
improvised
quarantine
without
discovery
then
the
riverman
with
slow
and
thoughtful
steps
returned
to
where
the
lamp
in
the
study
still
marked
off
with
the
spaced
replenishments
from
its
oil
reservoir
the
early
morning
hours
xlvi
morning
found
orde
still
seated
in
the
library
chair
his
head
was
sunk
forward
on
his
chest
his
hands
were
extended
listless
palms
up
along
the
arms
of
the
chair
his
eyes
were
vacant
and
troubled
hardly
once
in
the
long
hours
had
he
shifted
by
a
hair
breadth
his
position
his
body
was
suspended
in
an
absolute
inaction
while
his
spirit
battered
at
the
walls
of
an
impasse
for
strangely
enough
orde
did
not
once
even
for
a
single
instant
give
a
thought
to
the
business
aspects
of
the
situation
what
it
meant
to
him
and
his
prospects
or
what
he
could
do
about
it
hurt
to
the
soul
he
stared
at
the
wreck
of
a
friendship
nothing
will
more
deeply
sicken
the
heart
of
a
naturally
loyal
man
than
to
discover
baseless
his
faith
in
some
one
he
has
thoroughly
trusted
orde
had
liked
newmark
he
had
admired
heartily
his
clearness
of
vision
his
financial
skill
his
knowledge
of
business
intricacies
his
imperturbable
coolness
all
the
abilities
that
had
brought
him
to
success
with
a
man
of
orde
temperament
to
admire
is
to
like
and
to
like
is
to
invest
with
all
good
qualities
he
had
constructed
his
ideal
of
a
friend
with
newmark
as
a
basis
and
now
that
this
which
had
seemed
to
him
as
solid
a
reality
as
a
brick
block
had
dissolved
into
nothing
he
found
himself
in
the
necessity
of
refashioning
his
whole
world
he
was
not
angry
at
newmark
but
he
was
grieved
down
to
the
depths
of
his
being
when
the
full
sun
shone
into
the
library
he
aroused
himself
to
change
his
clothes
then
carrying
those
he
had
just
discarded
he
slipped
out
of
the
house
and
down
the
street
duke
the
black
and
white
setter
dog
begged
to
follow
him
orde
welcomed
the
animal
company
he
paused
only
long
enough
to
telephone
from
the
office
telling
carroll
he
would
be
out
of
town
all
day
then
he
set
out
at
a
long
swinging
gait
over
the
hills
by
the
time
the
sun
grew
hot
he
was
some
miles
from
the
village
and
in
the
high
beech
woods
there
he
sat
down
his
back
to
a
monster
tree
all
day
long
he
gazed
steadily
on
the
shifting
shadows
and
splotches
of
sunlight
on
the
patches
of
blue
sky
the
dazzling
white
clouds
that
sailed
across
them
on
the
waving
whispering
frond
that
him
and
the
deep
cool
shadows
beneath
the
woods
creatures
soon
became
accustomed
to
his
presence
squirrels
of
the
several
varieties
that
abounded
in
the
michigan
forests
scampered
madly
after
each
other
in
spirals
around
the
tree
trunks
or
bounded
across
the
ground
in
long
undulating
leaps
birds
flashed
and
called
and
disappeared
mysteriously
a
chewink
brave
in
his
black
and
white
and
tan
uniform
scratched
mightily
with
great
swoops
that
threw
the
vegetable
mould
over
orde
very
feet
blazoned
butterflies
the
yellow
and
black
turnus
the
dark
troilus
the
nymphalis
flickered
in
and
out
of
the
patches
of
sunlight
orde
paid
them
no
attention
the
noon
heat
poured
down
through
the
forest
isles
like
an
incense
overhead
swung
the
sun
and
down
the
slope
until
the
long
shafts
of
its
light
lifted
across
the
tree
trunks
at
this
hint
of
evening
orde
shook
himself
and
arose
he
was
little
nearer
the
readjustment
he
sought
than
he
had
been
the
previous
night
he
reached
home
a
little
before
six
to
his
surprise
he
found
taylor
awaiting
him
the
lawyer
had
written
nothing
as
to
his
return
had
things
pretty
well
in
shape
he
said
after
the
first
greetings
had
been
exchanged
it
would
do
no
good
to
stay
away
any
the
trouble
is
over
asked
orde
would
say
that
replied
taylor
you
can
rest
easy
as
to
the
title
to
your
lands
the
investigation
had
no
real
basis
to
it
there
may
have
been
some
small
individual
cases
of
false
entry
but
nothing
on
which
to
ground
a
real
can
i
borrow
on
it
for
a
year
or
two
i
should
say
there
an
awful
lot
of
to
unwind
as
there
always
is
in
such
said
orde
in
some
disappointment
taylor
hesitated
removed
his
wiped
them
carefully
and
replaced
them
he
glanced
at
orde
sidelong
through
his
keen
shrewd
eyes
have
something
more
to
tell
you
something
that
will
be
painful
said
he
orde
looked
up
quickly
what
is
it
he
asked
general
cussedness
of
all
this
investigation
business
had
me
puzzled
until
at
last
i
made
up
my
mind
to
do
a
little
investigating
on
my
own
account
it
all
looked
foolish
to
me
somebody
or
something
must
be
back
of
all
this
performance
i
was
at
it
all
the
time
i
was
west
between
times
on
regular
business
of
course
i
did
make
much
out
of
my
direct
efforts
they
cover
things
up
well
in
those
matters
but
at
last
i
got
on
a
clue
by
sheer
accident
there
was
one
man
behind
all
this
he
was
newmark
said
orde
quietly
did
you
know
that
cried
taylor
in
astonishment
did
know
frank
i
just
you
made
a
good
guess
it
was
newmark
he
tied
up
the
land
in
this
investigation
so
you
could
not
borrow
on
did
he
find
out
i
owned
any
land
asked
orde
i
could
tell
you
must
have
been
a
leak
likely
said
orde
calmly
taylor
looked
at
his
principal
in
some
wonder
i
must
say
you
take
it
coolly
enough
said
he
at
last
orde
smiled
i
said
he
course
went
on
taylor
after
a
moment
have
a
strong
presumption
of
conspiracy
to
get
hold
of
your
boom
company
stock
which
i
believe
you
put
up
as
security
but
i
do
see
how
we
have
any
incontestable
proof
of
what
more
do
we
want
have
no
witness
to
any
of
these
transactions
nor
have
we
documentary
proofs
it
merely
moral
certainty
and
moral
certainty
is
much
in
a
court
of
law
i
see
him
if
you
say
so
though
and
scare
him
into
some
sort
of
an
orde
shook
his
head
said
he
decidedly
not
i
run
this
please
say
course
not
interjected
taylor
a
trifle
indignantly
i
figure
out
what
i
want
to
orde
pressed
taylor
to
stay
to
supper
but
the
latter
declined
after
a
few
moments
conversation
on
general
topics
the
lawyer
took
his
departure
secretly
marvelling
over
the
phlegmatic
way
in
which
orde
had
taken
what
had
been
to
taylor
when
he
first
stumbled
against
it
a
shocking
piece
of
news
xlvii
orde
did
not
wish
to
return
to
the
office
until
he
had
worked
his
problem
out
so
to
lend
his
absence
the
colour
of
naturalness
he
drove
back
next
morning
to
the
booms
there
he
found
enough
to
keep
him
occupied
all
that
day
and
the
next
as
in
those
times
the
long
distance
telephone
had
not
yet
been
attempted
he
was
cut
off
from
casual
communication
with
the
village
late
in
the
afternoon
he
returned
home
a
telephone
to
carroll
apprised
him
that
all
was
well
with
her
a
few
moments
later
the
call
sounded
and
orde
took
a
message
that
caused
him
to
look
grave
and
to
whistle
gently
with
surprise
he
ate
supper
with
bobby
about
he
took
his
hat
and
walked
slowly
down
the
street
beneath
the
velvet
darkness
of
the
maples
at
newmark
he
turned
in
between
the
oleanders
mallock
answered
his
ring
sir
newmark
is
out
sir
said
mallock
tell
him
you
called
sir
and
started
respectfully
but
firmly
to
close
the
door
but
orde
thrust
his
foot
and
knee
in
the
opening
come
in
and
wait
said
he
quietly
sir
this
way
sir
said
mallock
trying
to
indicate
the
where
he
wished
orde
to
sit
until
he
could
come
at
his
master
wishes
in
the
matter
orde
caught
the
aroma
of
tobacco
and
the
glimmer
of
light
to
the
left
without
reply
he
turned
the
knob
of
the
door
and
entered
the
library
there
he
found
newmark
in
evening
dress
seated
in
a
low
easy
chair
beneath
a
lamp
smoking
and
reading
a
magazine
at
orde
appearance
in
the
doorway
he
looked
up
calmly
his
paper
knife
poised
keeping
the
place
it
you
orde
said
he
man
told
me
you
were
not
in
said
orde
was
mistaken
wo
you
sit
down
orde
entered
the
room
and
mechanically
obeyed
newmark
suggestion
his
manner
preoccupied
for
some
time
he
stared
with
wrinkled
brow
at
a
point
above
the
illumination
of
the
lamp
newmark
over
the
end
of
his
cigar
poised
a
foot
from
his
lips
watched
the
riverman
with
a
cool
calculation
orde
began
abruptly
at
last
know
all
about
this
deal
asked
newmark
after
a
barely
perceptible
pause
arrangement
you
made
with
borrowed
some
money
from
heinzman
for
the
and
you
supplied
that
money
newmark
eyes
narrowed
but
he
said
nothing
orde
glanced
toward
him
then
away
again
as
though
ashamed
said
newmark
at
last
of
it
you
had
the
money
to
lend
why
did
you
lend
it
direct
it
looks
better
to
mortgage
to
an
outside
an
expression
of
profound
disgust
flitted
across
orde
countenance
newmark
smiled
covertly
and
puffed
once
or
twice
strongly
on
his
nearly
extinct
cigar
was
not
the
reason
went
on
orde
agreed
with
heinzman
to
divide
when
you
succeeded
in
foreclosing
me
out
of
the
timber
lands
given
as
security
furthermore
you
instructed
floyd
to
go
out
on
the
eve
of
that
blow
in
spite
of
his
warnings
and
you
contracted
with
mcleod
for
the
new
vessels
and
you
tied
us
up
right
and
left
for
the
sole
purpose
of
pinching
us
down
where
we
could
meet
those
notes
the
only
reason
you
borrowed
the
thousand
on
your
own
account
so
we
could
borrow
it
to
save
strikes
me
you
are
interesting
but
inconclusive
said
newmark
as
orde
paused
again
sort
of
thing
is
somewhat
of
a
facer
went
on
orde
without
the
slightest
attention
to
the
interjection
took
me
some
days
to
work
it
out
in
all
its
details
but
i
believe
i
understand
it
all
now
i
do
quite
understand
how
you
discovered
about
my
california
timber
that
was
a
very
pretty
the
devil
did
you
get
onto
that
cried
newmark
startled
for
a
moment
out
of
his
cool
attitude
of
cynical
aloofness
you
acknowledge
it
shot
in
orde
quick
as
a
flash
newmark
laughed
in
amusement
should
i
of
course
heinzman
blabbed
you
could
have
got
it
all
anywhere
orde
arose
to
his
feet
and
half
sat
again
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
i
tell
you
what
we
will
do
in
this
matter
said
he
crisply
but
newmark
unexpectedly
took
the
aggressive
follow
said
he
original
programme
as
laid
down
by
myself
i
tired
of
dealing
with
blundering
fools
heinzman
mortgage
will
be
foreclosed
and
you
will
hand
over
as
per
the
agreement
your
boom
company
orde
stared
at
him
in
amazement
must
say
you
have
good
nerve
he
said
do
seem
to
realise
that
you
are
pretty
well
tangled
up
i
do
know
what
they
call
it
criminal
conspiracy
or
something
of
that
sort
i
suppose
so
far
from
handing
over
to
you
the
bulk
of
my
property
i
can
send
you
to
the
rejoined
newmark
leaning
forward
in
his
turn
know
you
too
well
jack
orde
you
a
fool
of
more
kinds
than
i
care
to
count
and
this
is
one
of
the
kinds
do
you
seriously
mean
to
say
that
you
dare
try
to
prosecute
me
just
as
sure
as
you
do
i
put
heinzman
in
the
pen
too
i
got
it
on
him
cold
he
a
bribe
giver
and
somewhat
of
a
criminal
conspirator
said
orde
newmark
leaned
back
with
an
amused
little
chuckle
the
man
come
to
you
and
given
the
whole
show
away
you
have
lost
every
cent
you
owned
he
did
you
the
biggest
favour
in
his
power
and
for
your
benefit
i
tell
you
what
you
can
easily
substantiate
i
forced
him
into
this
deal
with
me
i
had
this
bribery
case
on
him
and
in
addition
his
own
affairs
were
all
tied
knew
that
replied
orde
had
the
man
to
gain
by
telling
you
pursued
newmark
at
all
what
had
he
to
lose
everything
his
property
his
social
position
his
daughter
esteem
which
the
old
fool
holds
higher
than
any
of
them
you
could
put
me
in
the
pen
perhaps
with
heinzman
testimony
but
the
minute
heinzman
appears
on
the
stand
i
land
him
high
and
dry
and
gasping
without
a
chance
to
he
paused
a
moment
to
puff
at
his
cigar
finding
it
had
gone
out
he
laid
the
butt
carefully
on
the
ash
tray
at
his
elbow
not
much
used
to
giving
advice
he
went
on
of
all
when
it
is
at
all
likely
to
be
taken
but
i
offer
you
some
throw
heinzman
over
let
him
go
to
the
pen
he
been
crooked
and
a
what
you
do
i
suppose
said
orde
that
you
owe
nothing
to
heinzman
but
something
to
what
you
would
probably
call
repentance
but
which
is
in
reality
a
mawkish
sentimentality
of
weakness
however
i
know
you
jack
orde
from
top
to
bottom
and
i
know
you
fool
enough
not
to
do
it
i
so
sure
of
it
that
i
dare
put
it
to
you
straight
you
could
never
bring
yourself
to
the
point
of
destroying
a
man
who
had
sacrificed
himself
for

to
have
this
game
all
figured
out
said
orde
with
contempt
newmark
leaned
back
in
his
chair
two
bright
red
spots
burned
in
his
ordinarily
sallow
cheeks
he
half
closed
his
eyes
right
said
he
with
an
satisfaction
you
play
a
game
play
it
through
each
man
is
different
for
each
a
different
treatment
is
required
the
game
is
infinite
wonderful
fascinating
to
the
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
over
at
orde
with
a
mild
curiosity
suppose
men
are
about
all
of
one
kind
to
said
orde
grimly
honest
men
and
the
said
the
other

this
thing
the
fact
remains
that
the
firm
owes
a
note
to
heinzman
which
it
can
not
pay
you
owe
a
note
to
the
firm
which
you
can
not
pay
all
this
may
be
slightly
irregular
but
for
private
reasons
you
do
not
care
to
make
public
the
irregularity

i
right
so
far
orde
who
had
been
watching
him
with
a
slightly
sardonic
smile
nodded
what
i
want
out
of
this
might
hear
the
other
side
interrupted
orde
the
first
place
said
he
producing
a
bundle
of
papers
have
the
note
and
the
mortgage
in
my
heinzman
will
shortly
rescue
them
as
soon
as
i
get
to
see
him
countered
newmark
acknowledge
that
i
can
force
heinzman
and
you
can
hardly
refuse
you
force
heinzman
he
land
you
orde
pointed
out
is
canada
for
me
with
no
extradition
he
travels
with
heavier
baggage
i
have
the
better
lose
quite
smiled
newmark
as
usual
you
are
forgetting
the
personal
equation
heinzman
is
heinzman
and
i
am
i
suppose
this
affidavit
from
heinzman
as
to
the
details
of
all
this
is
useless
for
the
same
reason
newmark
thin
lips
parted
in
another
smile
said
he
you
ready
to
compromise
below
the
face
of
the
note
newmark
hesitated
tell
you
said
he
i
know
you
well
enough
to
realise
that
there
is
a
point
where
your
loyalty
to
heinzman
would
step
aside
in
favour
of
your
loyalty
to
your
you
think
you
know
where
that
point
is
the
basis
of
my
orde
began
softly
to
laugh
you
as
clever
as
the
devil
said
he
are
you
afraid
to
lay
out
your
cards
this
way
with
you
replied
newmark
boldly
anybody
else
on
earth
yes
with
you
orde
continued
to
laugh
still
in
the
low
undertone
worst
of
it
is
i
believe
you
right
said
he
at
last
have
the
thing
sized
up
and
there
is
a
flaw
in
your
reasoning
i
always
said
that
you
were
the
brains
of
this
concern
if
it
were
not
for
one
thing
i
compromise
sure
and
that
one
thing
was
beyond
your
power
to
he
paused
newmark
eyes
again
in
a
quick
darting
effort
of
his
brain
to
run
back
over
all
the
elements
of
the
game
he
was
playing
orde
waited
in
patience
for
him
to
speak
is
it
asked
newmark
at
last
died
of
smallpox
at
four
this
afternoon
said
orde
xlviii
newmark
did
not
alter
his
attitude
nor
his
expression
but
his
face
slowly
went
gray
for
a
full
minute
he
sat
absolutely
motionless
his
breath
coming
and
going
noisily
through
his
contracted
nostrils
then
he
arose
gropingly
to
his
feet
and
started
toward
one
of
the
two
doors
leading
from
the
room
are
you
going
asked
orde
quietly
newmark
steadied
himself
with
an
effort
going
to
get
myself
a
drink
in
my
bedroom
he
snapped
objections
replied
orde
after
you
get
your
drink
come
back
i
want
to
talk
to
newmark
snarled
at
him
need
be
afraid
i
run
away
how
i
get
out
of
town
know
it
would
pay
you
to
run
away
said
orde
newmark
passed
out
through
the
door
orde
looked
thoughtfully
at
heinzman
affidavit
which
duly
disinfected
had
been
handed
him
by
mcmullen
as
important
and
thrust
it
and
the
other
papers
into
his
inside
pocket
then
he
arose
to
his
feet
and
glided
softly
across
the
room
to
take
a
position
close
to
the
door
through
which
newmark
had
departed
in
quest
of
his
drink
for
a
half
minute
he
waited
finally
the
door
swung
briskly
inward
like
a
panther
as
quickly
and
as
noiselessly
orde
sprang
forward
a
short
but
decisive
struggle
ensued
in
less
than
ten
seconds
orde
had
pinioned
newmark
arms
to
his
side
where
he
held
them
immovable
with
one
of
his
own
the
other
hand
he
ran
down
newmark
right
arm
to
the
pocket
there
followed
an
instant
of
silent
resistance
then
with
a
sharp
cry
of
mingled
anger
and
pain
newmark
snatched
his
hand
out
and
gazed
a
trifle
amazedly
at
the
half
crushed
fingers
orde
drew
forth
the
revolver
newmark
had
grasped
concealed
in
the
coat
pocket
without
hesitation
he
closed
and
locked
the
bedroom
door
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
of
the
other
tried
and
fastened
the
window
the
revolver
he
opened
spilled
out
the
cartridges
into
his
hand
and
then
tossed
the
empty
weapon
to
newmark
who
had
sunk
into
the
chair
by
the
lamp
your
plaything
said
he
you
wanted
that
affidavit
did
you
now
we
have
the
place
to
ourselves
and
we
thresh
this
matter
he
paused
collecting
his
thoughts
do
need
to
tell
you
that
i
got
you
about
where
you
live
said
he
finally
what
i
think
of
you
the
case
is
open
and
shut
and
i
can
send
you
over
the
road
for
the
best
part
of
your
natural
days
also
i
got
these
notes
and
the
it
growled
newmark
got
me
send
me
up
and
be
the
question
went
on
orde
slowly
been
at
it
three
days
without
much
time
off
for
sleep
you
hurt
me
pretty
bad
joe
i
trusted
you
and
i
thought
of
you
as
a
newmark
stirred
slightly
with
impatience
had
a
hard
time
getting
over
that
part
of
it
and
about
of
what
was
left
in
the
world
looked
mighty
like
ashes
for
awhile
then
i
began
to
see
this
thing
a
little
clearer
we
been
together
a
good
many
years
now
and
as
near
as
i
can
make
out
been
straight
as
a
string
with
me
for
eight
of
them
then
i
suppose
the
chance
came
and
before
you
knew
it
you
were
in
over
your
he
looked
toward
newmark
newmark
made
no
sign
know
that
the
way
it
might
be
a
man
thinks
he
mighty
brave
and
so
he
is
as
long
as
he
can
see
what
coming
and
get
ready
for
it
but
some
day
an
emergency
just
comes
up
and
touches
him
on
the
shoulder
and
he
turns
around
and
sees
it
all
of
a
sudden
then
he
finds
he
a
coward
it
pretty
hard
for
me
to
understand
dishonesty
or
how
a
man
can
be
dishonest
i
tried
but
i
ca
do
it
crookedness
is
my
particular
kind
of
fault
but
i
do
know
this
that
we
every
one
of
us
have
something
to
be
forgiven
for
by
some
one
i
guess
i
got
a
temper
that
makes
me
pretty
sorry
sometimes
probably
you
do
see
how
possible
for
a
man
to
get
crazy
mad
about
little
things
that
is
your
particular
kind
of
for
god
sake
drop
that
preaching
it
makes
me
sick
broke
out
newmark
orde
smiled
whimsically
not
preaching
he
said
even
if
i
were
i
paid
a
good
many
thousands
of
dollars
it
seems
to
buy
the
right
to
say
what
i
damn
please
and
if
you
think
i
working
up
to
a
christian
forgiveness
racket
you
very
much
mistaken
i
not
i
do
forgive
you
and
i
surely
despise
your
sort
but
i
explaining
to
you
no
to
myself
just
what
i
been
at
for
three
turn
me
over
to
your
sheriff
and
let
get
through
with
this
said
newmark
sullenly
suppose
you
got
that
part
of
it
all
orde
rose
here
newmark
that
just
what
i
been
coming
to
just
what
i
had
such
a
hard
time
to
get
hold
of
i
felt
it
but
i
put
my
finger
on
it
now
i
know
i
not
going
to
hand
you
over
to
any
sheriff
i
going
to
let
you
off
no
he
continued
in
response
to
newmark
look
of
incredulous
amazement
is
from
any
fool
notion
of
forgiveness
i
told
you
i
did
forgive
you
but
i
not
going
to
burden
my
future
life
with
you
that
just
plain
ordinary
selfishness
i
suppose
i
really
ought
to
jug
you
but
if
i
do
i
always
carry
with
me
the
thought
that
i
taken
it
on
myself
to
judge
a
man
and
i
believe
any
man
is
competent
to
judge
another
i
told
you
why
or
tried
to
a
minute
or
so
ago
i
lived
clean
and
i
enjoyed
the
world
as
a
clean
sort
of
proposition
like
a
windy
day
and
i
always
hope
to
i
rather
drop
this
whole
matter
in
a
short
time
i
forget
you
you
pass
out
of
my
life
entirely
but
if
we
carry
this
thing
through
to
a
finish
i
always
have
the
thought
with
me
that
i
put
you
in
the
pen
that
you
are
there
now
i
do
like
the
notion
rather
finish
this
up
right
here
and
now
and
get
it
over
and
done
with
and
take
a
fresh
he
paused
and
wiped
his
brow
wet
with
the
unusual
exertion
of
this
think
a
fellow
ought
to
act
always
as
if
he
was
making
the
world
he
ought
to
try
not
to
put
things
in
it
that
are
going
to
make
it
an
unpleasant
or
an
evil
world
we
do
always
do
it
but
we
ought
to
try
now
if
i
were
making
a
world
i
would
put
a
man
in
a
penitentiary
in
it
of
course
there
dangerous
he
glanced
at
newmark
a
little
anxiously
do
believe
you
that
you
sharp
and
dishonest
and
need
punishment
but
you
do
need
extinction
anyway
i
not
going
to
bother
my
future
with
newmark
who
had
listened
to
this
long
and
rambling
exposition
with
increasing
curiosity
and
interest
broke
into
a
short
laugh
convicted
me
he
said
a
most
awful
failure
i
thought
i
knew
you
but
this
passes
all
orde
brushed
this
speech
aside
as
irrelevant
association
of
course
comes
to
an
end
there
remain
the
terms
of
settlement
i
could
fire
you
out
of
this
without
a
cent
and
you
have
to
git
but
that
would
be
fair
i
do
give
a
damn
for
you
but
it
would
be
fair
to
me
now
as
for
the
northern
peninsula
timber
you
have
had
thousand
out
of
that
and
have
lent
me
the
same
amount
call
that
quits
i
will
take
up
your
note
when
it
comes
due
and
destroy
the
one
given
to
heinzman
for
all
your
holdings
in
our
common
business
i
will
give
you
my
note
without
interest
and
without
time
for
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
that
is
not
its
face
value
nor
anything
like
it
but
you
have
caused
me
directly
and
indirectly
considerable
loss
i
do
know
how
soon
i
can
pay
this
note
but
it
will
be
right
agreed
newmark
that
satisfy
you
suppose
it
got
well
i
have
the
papers
here
all
made
out
they
need
simply
to
be
signed
and
witnessed
timbull
is
the
nearest
he
unlocked
the
outside
door
said
he
in
silence
the
two
walked
the
block
and
a
half
to
the
notary
house
here
they
were
forced
to
wait
some
time
while
timbull
dressed
himself
and
called
the
necessary
witnesses
finally
the
papers
were
executed
in
the
street
newmark
paused
significantly
but
orde
did
not
take
the
hint
you
coming
with
me
asked
newmark
am
replied
orde
is
one
thing
in
silence
once
more
they
returned
to
the
shadowy
low
library
filled
with
its
evidences
of
good
taste
newmark
threw
himself
into
the
armchair
he
was
quite
recovered
once
again
the
imperturbable
coldly
calculating
cynical
observer
orde
relocked
the
door
and
turned
to
face
him
have
five
days
to
leave
town
he
said
crisply
ever
show
up
here
again
let
me
have
your
address
for
the
payment
of
this
he
took
two
steps
forward
let
you
off
from
the
pen
because
i
did
want
my
life
bothered
with
the
thought
of
you
but
you
treated
me
like
a
hound
i
been
loyal
to
the
firm
interests
from
the
start
and
i
done
my
best
by
it
you
knifed
me
in
the
back
you
a
dirty
skunk
if
you
think
you
going
to
get
off
you
mightily
he
advanced
two
steps
more
newmark
half
arose
do
you
mean
he
asked
in
some
alarm
mean
that
i
going
to
give
you
about
the
worst
licking
you
ever
heard
tell
of
replied
orde
buttoning
his
coat
xlix
five
minutes
later
orde
emerged
from
newmark
house
softly
rubbing
the
palm
of
one
hand
over
the
knuckles
of
the
other
at
the
front
gate
he
paused
to
look
up
at
the
stars
then
he
shut
it
decisively
behind
him
up
through
the
maple
shaded
streets
he
walked
at
a
brisk
pace
breathing
deep
unconsciously
squaring
back
his
shoulders
the
incident
was
behind
him
in
his
characteristic
decisive
manner
he
had
wiped
the
whole
disagreeable
affair
off
the
slate
the
copartnership
with
its
gains
and
losses
its
struggles
and
easy
sailing
was
a
thing
of
the
past
only
there
remained
as
after
a
flood
the
sediment
a
final
result
of
it
all
the
balance
between
successes
and
failures
a
ground
beneath
the
feet
of
new
aspirations
orde
had
the
northern
peninsula
timber
the
boom
company
and
the
carrying
trade
they
were
all
burdened
with
debt
it
is
true
but
the
riverman
felt
surging
within
him
the
reawakened
and
powerful
energy
for
which
optimism
is
another
name
he
saw
stretching
before
him
a
long
life
of
endeavour
the
sort
of
endeavour
he
enjoyed
exulted
in
and
in
it
he
would
be
untrammelled
and
alone
the
idea
appealed
to
him
suddenly
he
was
impatient
for
the
morrow
that
he
might
begin
he
turned
out
of
the
side
street
his
own
house
lay
before
him
dark
save
for
the
gas
jet
in
the
hallway
and
the
single
lamp
in
the
library
a
harmony
of
softly
touched
chords
breathed
out
through
the
open
window
he
stopped
then
stole
forward
softly
until
he
stood
looking
in
through
the
doorway
carroll
sat
leaning
against
the
golden
harp
her
shining
head
with
the
soft
shadows
bent
until
it
almost
touched
the
strings
her
hands
were
straying
idly
over
accustomed
chords
and
rich
modulations
the
plaintive
of
reverie
a
soft
light
fell
on
her
slender
figure
half
revealed
the
oval
of
her
cheek
and
the
sweep
of
her
lashes
orde
crept
to
her
unheard
gently
he
clasped
her
from
behind
unsurprised
she
relinquished
the
harp
strings
and
sank
back
against
his
breast
with
a
happy
little
sigh
of
fun
being
married
is
it
sweetheart
he
repeated
their
quaint
formula
of
she
replied
and
raised
her
face
to
his
