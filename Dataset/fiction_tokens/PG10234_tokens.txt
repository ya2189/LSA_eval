chapter
i
an
old
house
a
few
steps
from
the
charles
hotel
in
new
orleans
brings
you
to
and
across
canal
street
the
central
avenue
of
the
city
and
to
that
corner
where
the
sit
at
the
inner
and
outer
edges
of
the
arcaded
sidewalk
and
make
the
air
sweet
with
their
fragrant
merchandise
the
crowd
and
if
it
is
near
the
time
of
the
carnival
it
will
be
great
will
follow
canal
street
but
you
turn
instead
into
the
quiet
narrow
way
which
a
lover
of
creole
antiquity
in
fondness
for
a
romantic
past
is
still
prone
to
call
the
rue
royale
you
will
pass
a
few
restaurants
a
few
a
few
furniture
warehouses
and
will
hardly
realize
that
you
have
left
behind
you
the
activity
and
clatter
of
a
city
of
merchants
before
you
find
yourself
in
a
region
of
architectural
decrepitude
where
an
ancient
and
domestic
life
in
second
stories
overhangs
the
ruins
of
a
former
commercial
prosperity
and
upon
every
thing
has
settled
down
a
long
sabbath
of
decay
the
vehicles
in
the
street
are
few
in
number
and
are
merely
passing
through
the
stores
are
shrunken
into
shops
you
see
here
and
there
like
a
patch
of
bright
mould
the
stall
of
that
significant
fungus
the
chinaman
many
great
doors
are
shut
and
clamped
and
grown
gray
with
cobweb
many
street
windows
are
nailed
up
half
the
balconies
are
begrimed
and
and
many
of
the
humid
arches
and
alleys
which
characterize
the
older
piles
of
stuccoed
brick
betray
a
squalor
almost
oriental
yet
beauty
lingers
here
to
say
nothing
of
the
picturesque
sometimes
you
get
sight
of
comfort
sometimes
of
opulence
through
the
unlatched
wicket
in
some
brick
pavement
foliage
of
dark
palm
or
pale
banana
marble
or
granite
masonry
and
blooming
parterres
or
through
a
chink
between
some
pair
of
heavy
batten
opened
with
an
almost
reptile
wariness
your
eye
gets
a
glimpse
of
lace
and
brocade
upholstery
silver
and
bronze
and
much
similar
rich
antiquity
the
faces
of
the
inmates
are
in
keeping
of
the
passengers
in
the
street
a
sad
proportion
are
dingy
and
shabby
but
just
when
these
are
putting
you
off
your
guard
there
will
pass
you
a
woman
more
likely
two
or
three
of
patrician
beauty
now
if
you
will
go
far
enough
down
this
old
street
you
will
see
as
you
approach
its
intersection
with
names
in
that
region
elude
one
like
ghosts
however
as
you
begin
to
find
the
way
a
trifle
more
open
you
will
not
fail
to
notice
on
the
side
about
midway
of
the
square
a
small
low
brick
house
of
a
story
and
a
half
set
out
upon
the
sidewalk
as
and
mute
as
an
aged
beggar
fallen
asleep
its
corrugated
roof
of
dull
red
tiles
sloping
down
toward
you
with
an
inward
curve
is
overgrown
with
weeds
and
in
the
fall
of
the
year
is
gay
with
the
yellow
plumes
of
the
you
can
almost
touch
with
your
cane
the
low
edge
of
the
broad
overhanging
eaves
the
batten
shutters
at
door
and
window
with
hinges
like
those
of
a
postern
are
shut
with
a
grip
that
makes
one
knuckles
and
nails
feel
lacerated
save
in
the
itself
there
is
not
a
cranny
you
would
say
the
house
has
the
lockjaw
there
are
two
doors
and
to
each
a
single
chipped
and
battered
marble
step
continuing
on
down
the
sidewalk
on
a
line
with
the
house
is
a
garden
masked
from
view
by
a
high
close
you
may
see
the
tops
of
its
pomegranate
peach
banana
fig
pear
and
particularly
one
large
orange
close
by
the
fence
that
must
be
very
old
the
residents
over
the
narrow
way
who
live
in
a
house
originally
of
much
pretension
but
from
whose
front
door
hard
times
have
removed
almost
all
vestiges
of
paint
will
tell
you
yass
de
is
is
live
in
and
this
is
likely
to
be
all
the
information
you
get
not
that
they
would
not
tell
but
they
can
not
grasp
the
idea
that
you
wish
to
know
until
possibly
just
as
you
are
turning
to
depart
your
informant
in
a
single
word
and
with
the
most
evident
of
its
value
drops
the
simple
key
to
the
whole
matter
dey
quadroons
he
may
then
be
aroused
to
mention
the
better
appearance
of
the
place
in
former
years
when
the
houses
of
this
region
generally
stood
farther
apart
and
that
garden
comprised
the
whole
square
here
dwelt
sixty
years
ago
and
more
one
delphine
carraze
or
as
she
was
commonly
designated
by
the
few
who
knew
her
madame
delphine
that
she
owned
her
home
and
that
it
had
been
given
her
by
the
then
deceased
companion
of
her
days
of
beauty
were
facts
so
generally
admitted
as
to
be
even
as
far
back
as
that
sixty
years
ago
no
longer
a
subject
of
gossip
she
was
never
pointed
out
by
the
denizens
of
the
quarter
as
a
character
nor
her
house
as
a
feature
it
would
have
passed
all
creole
powers
of
guessing
to
divine
what
you
could
find
worthy
of
inquiry
concerning
a
retired
quadroon
woman
and
not
the
least
puzzled
of
all
would
have
been
the
timid
and
restive
madame
delphine
herself
chapter
ii
madame
delphine
during
the
first
quarter
of
the
present
century
the
free
quadroon
caste
of
new
orleans
was
in
its
golden
age
earlier
generations
sprung
upon
the
one
hand
from
the
merry
gallants
of
a
french
colonial
military
service
which
had
grown
gross
by
affiliation
with
frontier
life
and
upon
the
other
hand
from
comely
ethiopians
culled
out
of
the
less
negroidal
types
of
african
live
goods
and
bought
at
the
ship
side
with
vestiges
of
quills
and
cowries
and
copper
wire
still
in
their
these
earlier
generations
with
scars
of
battle
or
private
rencontre
still
on
the
fathers
and
of
servitude
on
the
manumitted
mothers
afforded
a
mere
hint
of
the
splendor
that
was
to
result
from
a
survival
of
the
fairest
through
years
devoted
to
the
elimination
of
the
black
pigment
and
the
cultivation
of
hyperian
excellence
and
nymphean
grace
and
beauty
nor
if
we
turn
to
the
present
is
the
evidence
much
stronger
which
is
offered
by
the
de
whom
you
may
see
in
the
quadroon
quarter
this
afternoon
with
ichabod
legible
on
their
murky
foreheads
through
a
vain
smearing
of
toilet
powder
dragging
their
chairs
down
to
the
narrow
gateway
of
their
gardens
and
staring
shrinkingly
at
you
as
you
pass
like
a
nest
of
yellow
kittens
but
as
the
present
century
was
in
its
second
and
third
decades
the
for
we
must
contrive
a
feminine
spelling
to
define
the
strict
limits
of
the
caste
as
then
established
came
forth
in
splendor
old
travellers
spare
no
terms
to
tell
their
praises
their
faultlessness
of
feature
their
perfection
of
form
their
varied
styles
of
beauty
for
there
were
even
pure
caucasian
blondes
among
them
their
fascinating
manners
their
sparkling
vivacity
their
chaste
and
pretty
wit
their
grace
in
the
dance
their
modest
propriety
their
taste
and
elegance
in
dress
in
the
gentlest
and
most
poetic
sense
they
were
indeed
the
sirens
of
this
land
where
it
seemed
always
afternoon
a
momentary
triumph
of
an
arcadian
over
a
christian
civilization
so
beautiful
and
so
seductive
that
it
became
the
subject
of
special
chapters
by
writers
of
the
day
more
original
than
correct
as
social
philosophers
the
balls
that
were
got
up
for
them
by
the
male
were
to
that
day
what
the
carnival
is
to
the
present
society
balls
given
the
same
nights
proved
failures
through
the
coincidence
the
magnates
of
government
municipal
state
federal
those
of
the
army
of
the
learned
professions
and
of
the
clubs
in
short
the
white
male
aristocracy
in
every
thing
save
the
ecclesiastical
desk
were
there
tickets
were
to
insure
the
exclusion
of
the
vulgar
no
distinguished
stranger
was
allowed
to
miss
them
they
were
beautiful
they
were
clad
in
silken
extenuations
from
the
throat
to
the
feet
and
wore
withal
a
pathos
in
their
charm
that
gave
them
a
family
likeness
to
innocence
madame
delphine
were
you
not
a
stranger
could
have
told
you
all
about
it
though
hardly
i
suppose
without
tears
but
at
the
time
of
which
we
would
speak
her
day
of
splendor
was
set
and
her
husband
let
us
call
him
so
for
her
sake
was
long
dead
he
was
an
american
and
if
we
take
her
word
for
it
a
man
of
noble
heart
and
extremely
handsome
but
this
is
knowledge
which
we
can
do
without
even
in
those
days
the
house
was
always
shut
and
madame
chief
occupation
and
end
in
life
seemed
to
be
to
keep
well
locked
up
she
was
an
excellent
person
the
neighbors
said
a
very
worthy
person
and
they
were
maybe
nearer
correct
then
they
knew
they
rarely
saw
her
save
when
she
went
to
or
returned
from
church
a
small
rather
dark
quadroone
of
very
good
features
and
a
gentle
thoughtfulness
of
expression
which
would
take
long
to
describe
call
it
a
widow
look
in
speaking
of
madame
delphine
house
mention
should
have
been
made
of
a
gate
in
the
fence
on
the
sidewalk
it
is
gone
now
and
was
out
of
use
then
being
fastened
once
for
all
by
an
iron
staple
clasping
the
and
driven
into
the
post
which
leads
us
to
speak
of
another
person
chapter
iii
capitaine
lemaitre
he
was
one
of
those
men
that
might
be
any
age
thirty
forty
there
was
no
telling
from
his
face
what
was
years
and
what
was
only
weather
his
countenance
was
of
a
grave
and
quiet
but
also
luminous
sort
which
was
instantly
admired
and
ever
afterward
remembered
as
was
also
the
fineness
of
his
hair
and
the
blueness
of
his
eyes
those
pronounced
him
youngest
who
scrutinized
his
face
the
closest
but
waiving
the
discussion
of
age
he
was
odd
though
not
with
the
oddness
that
he
who
had
reared
him
had
striven
to
produce
he
had
not
been
brought
up
by
mother
or
father
he
had
lost
both
in
infancy
and
had
fallen
to
the
care
of
a
rugged
old
military
grandpa
of
the
colonial
school
whose
unceasing
endeavor
had
been
to
make
his
boy
as
savage
and
ferocious
a
holder
of
unimpeachable
social
rank
as
it
became
a
french
creole
to
be
who
would
trace
his
pedigree
back
to
the
god
mars
remember
my
boy
was
the
adjuration
received
by
him
as
regularly
as
his
waking
cup
of
black
coffee
that
none
of
your
family
line
ever
kept
the
laws
of
any
government
or
creed
and
if
it
was
well
that
he
should
bear
this
in
mind
it
was
well
to
reiterate
it
persistently
for
from
the
nurse
arms
the
boy
wore
a
look
not
of
docility
so
much
as
of
gentle
benevolence
the
domestics
of
the
old
man
house
used
to
shed
tears
of
laughter
to
see
that
look
on
the
face
of
a
babe
his
rude
guardian
addressed
himself
to
the
modification
of
this
facial
expression
it
had
not
enough
of
majesty
in
it
for
instance
or
of
large
but
with
care
these
could
be
made
to
come
and
true
enough
at
in
ursin
lemaitre
the
labors
of
his
grandfather
were
an
apparent
success
he
was
not
rugged
nor
was
he
as
his
venerable
trainer
would
have
liked
to
present
him
to
society
but
he
was
as
serenely
terrible
as
a
rifle
and
the
old
man
looked
upon
his
results
with
pride
he
had
cultivated
him
up
to
that
pitch
where
he
scorned
to
practise
any
vice
or
any
virtue
that
did
not
include
the
principle
of
a
few
touches
only
were
wanting
here
and
there
to
achieve
perfection
when
suddenly
the
old
man
died
yet
it
was
his
proud
satisfaction
before
he
finally
lay
down
to
see
ursin
a
favored
companion
and
the
peer
both
in
courtesy
and
pride
of
those
polished
gentlemen
famous
in
history
the
brothers
lafitte
the
two
lafittes
were
at
the
time
young
lemaitre
reached
his
majority
say
or
only
so
to
speak
a
term
intended
to
convey
the
idea
of
blacksmiths
who
never
soiled
their
hands
who
were
men
of
capital
stood
a
little
higher
than
the
clergy
and
moved
in
society
among
its
autocrats
but
they
were
full
of
possibilities
men
of
action
and
men
too
of
thought
with
already
a
pronounced
disbelief
in
the
in
these
days
of
big
carnivals
they
would
have
been
patented
as
the
dukes
of
little
manchac
and
barataria
young
ursin
lemaitre
in
full
the
name
was
had
not
only
the
hearty
friendship
of
these
good
people
but
also
a
natural
turn
for
accounts
and
as
his
two
friends
were
looking
about
them
with
an
enterprising
eye
it
easily
resulted
that
he
presently
connected
himself
with
the
blacksmithing
profession
not
exactly
at
the
forge
in
the
lafittes
famous
smithy
among
the
african
samsons
who
with
their
shining
black
bodies
bared
to
the
waist
made
the
rue

the
stroke
of
their
hammers

where
was
the
difference
beyond
the
ken

which
the
enforcement
of

had
long
been
merely
so
much
out

at
this

had
come
under

kinder
yoke
and
to
a
treasury
that
at
least
echoed
when
the
customs
were
dropped
into
it
but
the
change
was
still
new
what
could
a
man
be
more
than
capitaine
lemaitre
was
the

of
honor
the
pink
of

the
courage
of

and
the
magnanimity
of

paper
was
good
in

to
the
gossips
in
the
he
was
the
culminating
proof
that
smuggling
was
one
of
the
sublimer
virtues
years
went
by
events
transpired
which
have
their
place
in
history
under
a
government
which
the
community
by
and
by
saw
was
conducted
in
their
interest
smuggling
began
to
lose
its
respectability
and
to
grow
disreputable
hazardous
and
debased
in
certain
onslaughts
made
upon
them
by
officers
of
the
law
some
of
the
smugglers
became
murderers
the
business
became
unprofitable
for
a
time
until
the
enterprising
lafittes
thinkers
bethought
them
of
a
corrective
privateering
thereupon
the
united
states
government
set
a
price
upon
their
heads
later
yet
it
became
known
that
these
outlawed
pirates
had
been
offered
money
and
rank
by
great
britain
if
they
would
join
her
standard
then
hovering
about
the

their
native
city
and
that
they
had
spurned
the
bribe
wherefore
their
heads
were
ruled
out
of
the
market
and
meeting
and
treating
with
andrew
jackson
they
were
received
as
lovers
of
their
country
and
as
compatriots
fought
in
the
battle
of
new

at
the
head
of
their
fearless
men

the
roundest
and
priest
in
the
city
of
new

was
a
little
man
fondly
known
among
his
people
as
père
jerome
he
was
a
creole
and
a
member
of
one
of
the
city
leading
families
his
dwelling
was
a
little
frame
cottage
standing
on
high
pillars
just
inside
a
tall
close
fence
and
reached
by
a
narrow
stair
from
the

it

surrounded
by

communicated

here
and
there
all
there
is
certainty
of
is
that
père
jerome
frame
chapel
was
some
little
thing
that
may
have
survived
the
passage
of
years
or
may
have
escaped
paxton
directory
so
as
by
fire
his
parlor
was
dingy
and
carpetless
one
could
smell
distinctly
there
the
vow
of
poverty
his
was
bare
and
clean
and
the
bed
in
it
narrow
and
hard
but
between
the
two
was
a
that
would
tempt
a
laugh
to
the
lips
of
any
who
looked
in
the
table
was
small
but
stout
and
all
the
furniture
of
the
room
substantial
made
of
fine
wood
and
carved
just
enough
to
give
the
notion
of
wrinkling
pleasantry
his
mother
and
sister
doing
père
jerome
would
explain
they
would
not
permit
this
apartment
or
department
to
suffer
therein
as
well
as
in
the
parlor
there
was
odor
but
of
a
more
epicurean
sort
that
explained
interestingly
the
père
jerome
rotundity
and
rosy
smile
in
this
room
and
about
this
miniature
round
table
used
sometimes
to
sit
with
père
jerome
two
friends
to
whom
he
was
deeply
attached
one
evariste
varrillat
a
playmate
from
early
childhood
now
his
brother
the
other
jean
thompson
a
companion
from
youngest
manhood
and
both
like
the
little
priest
himself
the
regretful
rememberers
of
a
fourth
comrade
who
was
a
comrade
no
more
like
père
jerome
they
had
come
through
years
to
the
thick
of
life
conflicts
the
a
physician
the
other
an
attorney
and
to
the
lonely
wanderer
yet
they
loved
to
huddle
around
this
small
board
and
be
boys
again
in
heart
while
men
in
mind
neither
one
nor
another
was
leader
in
earlier
days
they
had
always
yielded
to
him
who
no
longer
met
with
them
a
certain
chieftainship
and
they
still
thought
of
him
and
talked
of
him
and
in
their
conjectures
groped
after
him
as
one
of
whom
they
continued
to
expect
greater
things
than
of
themselves
they
sat
one
day
drawn
thus
close
together
sipping
and
theorizing
speculating
upon
the
nature
of
things
in
an
easy
bold
sophomoric
way
the
conversation
for
the
most
part
being
in
french
the
native
tongue
of
the
doctor
and
priest
and
spoken
with
facility
by
jean
thompson
the
lawyer
who
was
half
américain
but
running
sometimes
into
english
and
sometimes
into
mild
laughter
mention
had
been
made
of
the
absentee
père
jerome
advanced
an
idea
something
like
this
it
is
impossible
for
any
finite
mind
to
fix
the
degree
of
criminality
of
any
human
act
or
of
any
human
life
the
infinite
one
alone
can
know
how
much
of
our
sin
is
chargeable
to
us
and
how
much
to
our
brothers
or
our
fathers
we
all
participate
in
one
another
sins
there
is
a
community
of
responsibility
attaching
to
every
misdeed
no
human
since
adam
nay
nor
adam
himself
ever
sinned
entirely
to
himself
and
so
i
never
am
called
upon
to
contemplate
a
crime
or
a
criminal
but
i
feel
my
conscience
pointing
at
me
as
one
of
the
accessories
in
a
word
said
evariste
varrillat
the
physician
you
think
we
are
partly
to
blame
for
the
omission
of
many
of
your
paternosters
eh
father
jerome
smiled
no
a
man
can
not
plead
so
in
his
own
defence
our
first
father
tried
that
but
the
plea
was
not
allowed
but
now
there
is
our
absent
friend
i
tell
you
truly
this
whole
community
ought
to
be
recognized
as
partners
in
his
moral
errors
among
another
people
reared
under
wiser
care
and
with
better
companions
how
different
might
he
not
have
been
how
can
we
speak
of
him
as
a
who
might
have
saved
him
from
that
name
here
the
speaker
turned
to
jean
thompson
and
changed
his
speech
to
english
a
lady
sez
to
me
jerome
dat
is
a
dreadfool
dat
gone
at
de
coas
of
cuba
to
be
one
corsair
ai

madame
i
sez
tis
a

de
good

will

an
you
fo
dat
jean
thompson
answered
quickly
you
should
not
have
let
her
say
that
fo
why
because
if
you
are
partly
responsible
you
ought
so
much
the
more
to
do
what
you
can
to
shield
his
reputation
you
should
have
said
the
attorney
changed
to
french
is
no
pirate
he
has
merely
taken
out
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
under
the
flag
of
the
republic
of
carthagena
exclaimed
doctor
varrillat
and
both
he
and
his
the
priest
laughed
why
not
demanded
thompson
oh
said
the
physician
with
a
shrug
say
id
thad
way
iv
you
wand
then
suddenly
becoming
serious
he
was
about
to
add
something
else
when
père
jerome
spoke
i
will
tell
you
what
i
could
have
said
i
could
have
said
yes
is
a
terrible

in

but

good

will
mek
it

dat
man
oohever
he
is
put

out
but
how
do
you
know
he
is
a
pirate
demanded
thompson
aggressively
how
do
we
know
said
the
little
priest
returning
to
french
ah
there
is
no
other
explanation
of
the
stories
that
come
to
us
from
every
port
where
ships
arrive
from
the
north
coast
of
cuba
of
a
commander
of
pirates
there
who
is
a
marvel
of
courtesy
and
gentility

the
obstinate

jean
said
doctor
varrillat
we
hall
know
daz
troo
père
jerome
leaned
forward
over
the
board
and
spoke
with
an
air
of
secrecy
in
french
you
have
heard
of
the
ship
which
came
into
port
here
last
monday
you
have
heard
that
she
was
boarded
by
pirates
and
that
the
captain
of
the
ship
himself
drove
them
off
an
incredible
story
said
thompson
but
not
so
incredible
as
the
truth
i
have
it
from
a
passenger
there
was
on
the
ship
a
young
girl
who
was
very
beautiful
she
came
on
deck
where
the
corsair
stood
about
to
issue
his
orders
and
more
beautiful
than
ever
in
the
desperation
of
the
moment
confronted
him
with
a
small
missal
spread
open
and
her
finger
on
the
apostles
creed
commanded
him
to
read
he
read
it
uncovering
his
head
as
he
read
then
stood
gazing
on
her
face
which
did
not
quail
and
then
with
a
low
bow
said
me
this
book
and
i
will
do
your
bidding
she
gave
him
the
book
and
bade
him
leave
the
ship
and
he
left
it
unmolested
père
jerome
looked
from
the
physician
to
the
attorney
and
back
again
once
or
twice
with
his
dimpled
smile
but
he
speaks
english
they
say
said
jean
thompson
he
has
no
doubt
learned
it
since
he
left
us
said
the
priest
but
this
too

his

called

père
jerome
sat
up
late
that
night
writing
a
letter
the
remarkable
effects
upon
a
certain
mind
effects
which
we
shall
presently
find
him
attributing
solely
to
the
influences
of
surrounding
nature
may
find
for
some
a
more
sufficient
explanation
in
the
fact
that
this
letter
was
but
one
of
a
series
and
that
in
the
rover
of
doubted
identity
and
incredible
eccentricity
père
jerome
had
a
regular
correspondent
chapter
the
cap
fits
about
two
months
after
the
conversation
just
given
and
therefore
somewhere
about
the
christmas
holidays
of
the
year
père
jerome
delighted
the
congregation
of
his
little
chapel
with
the
announcement
that
he
had
appointed
to
preach
a
sermon
in
french
on
the
following
sabbath
not
there
but
in
the
cathedral
he
was
much
beloved
notwithstanding
that
among
the
clergy
there
were
two
or
three
who
shook
their
heads
and
raised
their
eyebrows
and
said
he
would
be
at
least
as
orthodox
if
he
did
not
make
quite
so
much
of
the
bible
and
quite
so
little
of
the
dogmas
yet
the
common
people
heard
him
gladly
when
told
one
day
of
the
unfavorable
whispers
he
smiled
a
little
and
answered
his
informant
whom
he
knew
to
be
one
of
the
whisperers
himself
laying
a
hand
kindly
upon
his
shoulder
father
murphy
or
whatever
the
name
was
your
words
comfort
me
how
is
that
because
quum
benedixerint
mihi
homines
footnote
woe
unto
me
when
all
men
speak
well
of
me
the
appointed
morning
when
it
came
was
one
of
those
exquisite
days
in
which
there
is
such
a
universal
harmony
that
worship
rises
from
the
heart
like
a
spring
truly
said
père
jerome
to
the
companion
who
was
to
assist
him
in
the
mass
this
is
a
sabbath
day
which
we
do
not
have
to
make
holy
but
only
to
so
maybe
it
was
one
of
the
secrets
of
père
jerome
success
as
a
preacher
that
he
took
more
thought
as
to
how
he
should
feel
than
as
to
what
he
should
say
the
cathedral
of
those
days
was
called
a
very
plain
old
pile
boasting
neither
beauty
nor
riches
but
to
père
jerome
it
was
very
lovely
and
before
its
homely
altar
not
homely
to
him
in
the
performance
of
those
solemn
offices
symbols
of
heaven
mightiest
truths
in
the
hearing
of
the
organ
harmonies
and
the
yet
more
elegant
interunion
of
human
voices
in
the
choir
in
overlooking
the
worshipping
throng
which
knelt
under
the
soft
chromatic
lights
and
in
breathing
the
sacrificial
odors
of
the
chancel
he
found
a
deep
and
solemn
joy
and
yet
i
guess
the
finest
thought
of
his
the
while
was
one
that
came
thrice
and
again
be
not
deceived
père
jerome
because
saintliness
of
feeling
is
easy
here
you
are
the
same
priest
who
overslept
this
morning
and
yesterday
and
will
in
some
way
easily
go
wrong
and
the
day
after
he
took
it
with
him
when
the
sung
he
went
into
the
pulpit
of
the
sermon
he
preached
tradition
has
preserved
for
us
only
a
few
brief
sayings
but
they
are
strong
and
sweet
my
friends
he
said
this
was
near
the
beginning
the
angry
words
of
god
book
are
very
merciful
they
are
meant
to
drive
us
home
but
the
tender
words
my
friends
they
are
sometimes
terrible
notice
these
the
tenderest
words
of
the
tenderest
prayer
that
ever
came
from
the
lips
of
a
blessed
martyr
the
dying
words
of
the
holy
saint
stephen
lay
not
this
sin
to
their
charge
is
there
nothing
dreadful
in
that
read
it
thus
lay
not
this
sin
to
their
charge
not
to
the
charge
of
them
who
stoned
him
to
whose
charge
then
go
ask
the
holy
saint
paul
three
years
afterward
praying
in
the
temple
at
jerusalem
he
answered
that
question
stood
by
and
consented
he
answered
for
himself
only
but
the
day
must
come
when
all
that
wicked
council
that
sent
saint
stephen
away
to
be
stoned
and
all
that
city
of
jerusalem
must
hold
up
the
hand
and
say
also
lord
we
stood
by
ah
friends
under
the
simpler
meaning
of
that
dying
saint
prayer
for
the
pardon
of
his
murderers
is
hidden
the
terrible
truth
that
we
all
have
a
share
in
one
another
sins
thus
père
jerome
touched
his
all
that
time
has
spared
us
beside
may
be
given
in
a
few
sentences
ah
he
cried
once
if
it
were
merely
my
own
sins
that
i
had
to
answer
for
i
might
hold
up
my
head
before
the
rest
of
mankind
but
no
no
my
friends
we
can
not
look
each
other
in
the
face
for
each
has
helped
the
other
to
sin
oh
where
is
there
any
room
in
this
world
of
common
disgrace
for
pride
even
if
we
had
no
common
hope
a
common
despair
ought
to
bind
us
together
and
forever
silence
the
voice
of
scorn
and
again
this
even
in
the
promise
to
noë
not
again
to
destroy
the
race
with
a
flood
there
is
a
whisper
of
solemn
warning
the
moral
account
of
the
antediluvians
was
closed
off
and
the
balance
brought
down
in
the
year
of
the
deluge
but
the
account
of
those
who
come
after
runs
on
and
on
and
the
blessed
bow
of
promise
itself
warns
us
that
god
will
not
stop
it
till
the
judgment
day
o
god
i
thank
thee
that
that
day
must
come
at
last
when
thou
wilt
destroy
the
world
and
stop
the
interest
on
my
account
it
was
about
at
this
point
that
père
jerome
noticed
more
particularly
than
he
had
done
before
sitting
among
the
worshippers
near
him
a
small
woman
of
pleasing
features
but
dark
and
faded
who
gave
him
profound
attention
with
her
was
another
in
better
dress
seemingly
a
girl
still
in
her
teens
though
her
face
and
neck
were
scrupulously
concealed
by
a
heavy
veil
and
her
hands
which
were
small
by
gloves
quadroones
thought
he
with
a
stir
of
deep
pity
once
as
he
uttered
some
stirring
word
he
saw
the
mother
and
daughter
if
such
they
were
while
they
still
bent
their
gaze
upon
him
clasp
each
other
hand
fervently
in
the
daughter
lap
it
was
at
these
words
my
friends
there
are
thousands
of
people
in
this
city
of
new
orleans
to
whom
society
gives
the
ten
commandments
of
god
with
all
the
rubbed
out
ah
good
gentlemen
if
god
sends
the
poor
weakling
to
purgatory
for
leaving
the
right
path
where
ought
some
of
you
to
go
who
strew
it
with
thorns
and
briers
the
movement
of
the
pair
was
only
seen
because
he
watched
for
it
he
glanced
that
way
again
as
he
said
o
god
be
very
gentle
with
those
children
who
would
be
nearer
heaven
this
day
had
they
never
had
a
father
and
mother
but
had
got
their
religious
training
from
such
a
sky
and
earth
as
we
have
in
louisiana
this
holy
morning
ah
my
friends
nature
is
a
catechism
the
mother
and
daughter
leaned
a
little
farther
forward
and
exchanged
the
same
spasmodic
as
before
the
mother
eyes
were
full
of
tears
i
once
knew
a
man
continued
the
little
priest
glancing
to
a
side
aisle
where
he
had
noticed
evariste
and
jean
sitting
against
each
other
who
was
carefully
taught
from
infancy
to
manhood
this
single
only
principle
of
life
defiance
not
justice
not
righteousness
not
even
gain
but
defiance
defiance
to
god
defiance
to
man
defiance
to
nature
defiance
to
reason
defiance
and
defiance
and
defiance
he
is
going
to
tell
it
murmured
evariste
to
jean
this
man
continued
père
jerome
became
a
smuggler
and
at
last
a
pirate
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
lord
lay
not
that
sin
to
his
charge
alone
but
a
strange
thing
followed
being
in
command
of
men
of
a
sort
that
to
control
required
to
be
kept
at
the
austerest
distance
he
now
found
himself
separated
from
the
human
world
and
thrown
into
the
solemn
companionship
with
the
sea
with
the
air
with
the
storm
the
calm
the
heavens
by
day
the
heavens
by
night
my
friends
that
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
he
ever
found
himself
in
really
good
company
now
this
man
had
a
great
aptness
for
accounts
he
had
kept
them
had
rendered
them
there
was
beauty
to
him
in
a
correct
balanced
and
closed
account
an
account
unsatisfied
was
a
deformity
the
result
is
plain
that
man
looking
out
night
after
night
upon
the
grand
and
holy
spectacle
of
the
starry
deep
above
and
the
watery
deep
below
was
sure
to
find
himself
sooner
or
later
mastered
by
the
conviction
that
the
great
author
of
this
majestic
creation
keeps
account
of
it
and
one
night
there
came
to
him
like
a
spirit
walking
on
the
sea
the
awful
silent
question
account
with
god
how
does
it
stand
ah
friends
that
is
a
question
which
the
book
of
nature
does
not
answer
did
i
say
the
book
of
nature
is
a
catechism
yes
but
after
it
answers
the
first
question
with
nothing
but
questions
follow
and
so
one
day
this
man
gave
a
ship
full
of
merchandise
for
one
little
book
which
answered
those
questions
god
help
him
to
understand
it
and
god
help
you
monsieur
and
you
madame
sitting
here
in
your
to
beat
upon
the
breast
with
me
and
cry
too
lord
i
too
stood
by
and
consented
père
jerome
had
not
intended
these
for
his
closing
words
but
just
there
straight
away
before
his
sight
and
almost
at
the
farthest
door
a
man
rose
slowly
from
his
seat
and
regarded
him
steadily
with
a
kind
bronzed
sedate
face
and
the
sermon
as
if
by
a
sign
of
command
was
ended
while
the
credo
was
being
chanted
he
was
still
there
but
when
a
moment
after
its
close
the
eye
of
père
jerome
returned
in
that
direction
his
place
was
empty
as
the
little
priest
his
labor
done
and
his
vestments
changed
was
turning
into
the
rue
royale
and
leaving
the
cathedral
out
of
sight
he
just
had
time
to
understand
that
two
women
were
purposely
allowing
him
to
overtake
them
when
the
one
nearer
him
spoke
in
the
creole
saying
with
some
timid
haste
père
père
jerome
père
jerome
we
thank
the
good
god
for
that
sermon
then
so
do
i
said
the
little
man
they
were
the
same
two
that
he
had
noticed
when
he
was
preaching
the
younger
one
bowed
silently
she
was
a
beautiful
figure
but
the
slight
effort
of
père
jerome
kind
eyes
to
see
through
the
veil
was
vain
he
would
presently
have
passed
on
but
the
one
who
had
spoken
before
said
i
thought
you
lived
in
the
rue
des
ursulines
yes
but
i
am
going
this
way
to
see
a
sick
person
the
woman
looked
up
at
him
with
an
expression
of
mingled
confidence
and
timidity
it
must
be
a
blessed
thing
to
be
so
useful
as
to
be
needed
by
the
good
god
she
said
père
jerome
smiled
god
does
not
need
me
to
look
after
his
sick
but
he
allows
me
to
do
it
just
as
you
let
your
little
boy
in
frocks
carry
in
chips
he
might
have
added
that
he
loved
to
do
it
quite
as
much
it
was
plain
the
woman
had
somewhat
to
ask
and
was
trying
to
get
courage
to
ask
it
you
have
a
little
boy
asked
the
priest
no
i
have
only
my
daughter
she
indicated
the
girl
at
her
side
then
she
began
to
say
something
else
stopped
and
with
much
nervousness
asked
père
jerome
what
was
the
name
of
that
man
his
name
said
the
priest
you
wish
to
know
his
name
yes
monsieur
or
as
she
spoke
it
it
was
such
a
beautiful
story
the
speaker
companion
looked
another
way
his
name
said
father
jerome
some
say
one
name
and
some
another
some
think
it
was
jean
lafitte
the
famous
you
have
heard
of
him
and
do
you
go
to
my
church
madame
no
miché
not
in
the
past
but
from
this
time
yes
my
name
she
choked
a
little
and
yet
it
evidently
gave
her
pleasure
to
offer
this
mark
of
confidence
is
madame
delphine
delphine
carraze
chapter
vi
a
cry
of
distress
père
jerome
smile
and
exclamation
as
some
days
later
he
entered
his
parlor
in
response
to
the
announcement
of
a
visitor
were
indicative
of
hearty
greeting
rather
than
surprise
madame
delphine
yet
surprise
could
hardly
have
been
altogether
absent
for
though
another
sunday
had
not
yet
come
around
the
slim
smallish
figure
sitting
in
a
corner
looking
very
much
alone
and
clad
in
dark
attire
which
seemed
to
have
been
washed
a
trifle
too
often
was
delphine
carraze
on
her
second
visit
and
this
he
was
confident
was
over
and
above
an
attendance
in
the
confessional
where
he
was
sure
he
had
recognized
her
voice
she
rose
bashfully
and
gave
her
hand
then
looked
to
the
floor
and
began
a
faltering
speech
with
a
swallowing
motion
in
the
throat
smiled
weakly
and
commenced
again
speaking
as
before
in
a
gentle
low
note
frequently
lifting
up
and
casting
down
her
eyes
while
shadows
of
anxiety
and
smiles
of
apology
chased
each
other
rapidly
across
her
face
she
was
trying
to
ask
his
advice
sit
down
said
he
and
when
they
had
taken
seats
she
resumed
with
downcast
eyes
you
know
probably
i
should
have
said
this
in
the
confessional
but
no
matter
madame
delphine
i
understand
you
did
not
want
an
oracle
perhaps
you
want
a
friend
she
lifted
her
eyes
shining
with
tears
and
dropped
them
again
i
she
ceased
i
have
done
a
she
dropped
her
head
and
shook
it
despondingly
a
cruel
thing
the
tears
rolled
from
her
eyes
as
she
turned
away
her
face
père
jerome
remained
silent
and
presently
she
turned
again
with
the
evident
intention
of
speaking
at
length
it
began
nineteen
years
ago
by
her
eyes
which
she
had
lifted
fell
lower
than
ever
her
brow
and
neck
were
suffused
with
blushes
and
she
murmured
i
fell
in
love
she
said
no
more
and
by
and
by
père
jerome
replied
well
madame
delphine
to
love
is
the
right
of
every
soul
i
believe
in
love
if
your
love
was
pure
and
lawful
i
am
sure
your
angel
guardian
smiled
upon
you
and
if
it
was
not
i
can
not
say
you
have
nothing
to
answer
for
and
yet
i
think
god
may
have
said
is
a
quadroone
all
the
rights
of
her
womanhood
trampled
in
the
mire
sin
made
easy
to
her
almost
compulsory
charge
it
to
account
of
whom
it
may
concern
no
no
said
madame
delphine
looking
up
quickly
some
of
it
might
fall
upon
her
eyes
fell
and
she
commenced
biting
her
lips
and
nervously
pinching
little
folds
in
her
skirt
he
was
good
as
good
as
the
law
would
let
him
be
better
indeed
for
he
left
me
property
which
really
the
strict
law
does
not
allow
he
loved
our
little
daughter
very
much
he
wrote
to
his
mother
and
sisters
owning
all
his
error
and
asking
them
to
take
the
child
and
bring
her
up
i
sent
her
to
them
when
he
died
which
was
soon
after
and
did
not
see
my
child
for
sixteen
years
but
we
wrote
to
each
other
all
the
time
and
she
loved
me
and
then
at
last
madame
delphine
ceased
speaking
but
went
on
diligently
with
her
agitated
fingers
turning
down
foolish
hems
lengthwise
of
her
lap
at
last
your
conquered
said
père
jerome
she
nodded
the
sisters
married
the
mother
died
i
saw
that
even
where
she
was
she
did
not
escape
the
reproach
of
her
birth
and
blood
and
when
she
asked
me
to
let
her
come
the
speaker
brimming
eyes
rose
an
instant
i
know
it
was
wicked
but
i
said
come
the
tears
dripped
through
her
hands
upon
her
dress
was
it
she
who
was
with
you
last
sunday
yes
and
now
you
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
her
ça
that
is
it
does
she
look
like
you
madame
delphine
oh
thank
god
no
you
would
never
believe
she
was
my
daughter
she
is
white
and
beautiful
you
thank
god
for
that
which
is
your
main
difficulty
madame
delphine
alas
yes
père
jerome
laid
his
palms
tightly
across
his
knees
with
his
arms
bowed
out
and
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
pondering
i
suppose
she
is
a
sweet
good
daughter
said
he
glancing
at
madame
delphine
without
changing
his
attitude
her
answer
was
to
raise
her
eyes
rapturously
which
gives
us
the
dilemma
in
its
fullest
force
said
the
priest
speaking
as
if
to
the
floor
she
has
no
more
place
than
if
she
had
dropped
upon
a
strange
planet
he
suddenly
looked
up
with
a
brightness
which
almost
as
quickly
passed
away
and
then
he
looked
down
again
his
happy
thought
was
the
cloister
but
he
instantly
said
to
himself
they
can
not
have
overlooked
that
choice
except
intentionally
which
they
have
a
right
to
do
he
could
do
nothing
but
shake
his
head
and
suppose
you
should
suddenly
die
he
said
he
wanted
to
get
at
once
to
the
worst
the
woman
made
a
quick
gesture
and
buried
her
head
in
her
handkerchief
with
the
stifled
cry
oh
olive
my
daughter
well
madame
delphine
said
père
jerome
more
buoyantly
one
thing
is
sure
we
find
a
way
out
of
this
trouble
ah
she
exclaimed
looking
heavenward
if
it
might
be
but
it
must
be
said
the
priest
but
how
shall
it
be
asked
the
desponding
woman
ah
said
père
jerome
with
a
shrug
god
knows
yes
said
the
quadroone
with
a
quick
sparkle
in
her
gentle
eye
and
i
know
if
god
would
tell
anybody
he
would
tell
you
the
priest
smiled
and
rose
do
you
think
so
well
leave
me
to
think
of
it
i
will
ask
him
and
he
will
tell
you
she
replied
and
he
will
bless
you
she
rose
and
gave
her
hand
as
she
withdrew
it
she
smiled
i
had
such
a
strange
dream
she
said
backing
toward
the
door
yes
yes
i
got
my
troubles
all
mixed
up
with
your
sermon
i
dreamed
i
made
that
pirate
the
guardian
of
my
daughter
père
jerome
smiled
also
and
shrugged
to
you
madame
delphine
as
you
are
placed
every
white
man
in
this
country
on
land
or
on
water
is
a
pirate
and
of
all
pirates
i
think
that
one
is
without
doubt
the
best
without
doubt
echoed
madame
delphine
wearily
still
withdrawing
backward
père
jerome
stepped
forward
and
opened
the
door
the
shadow
of
some
one
approaching
it
from
without
fell
upon
the
threshold
and
a
man
entered
dressed
in
dark
blue
cottonade
lifting
from
his
head
a
fine
panama
hat
and
from
a
broad
smooth
brow
fair
where
the
hat
had
covered
it
and
dark
below
gently
stroking
back
his
very
soft
brown
locks
madame
delphine
slightly
started
aside
while
père
jerome
reached
silently
but
eagerly
forward
grasped
a
larger
hand
than
his
own
and
motioned
its
owner
to
a
seat
madame
eyes
ventured
no
higher
than
to
discover
that
the
shoes
of
the
visitor
were
of
white
duck
well
père
jerome
she
said
in
a
hurried
undertone
i
am
just
going
to
say
hail
marys
all
the
time
till
you
find
that
out
for
me
well
i
hope
that
will
be
soon
madame
carraze
madame
carraze
and
as
she
departed
the
priest
turned
to
the
newcomer
and
extended
both
hands
saying
in
the
same
familiar
dialect
in
which
he
had
been
addressing
the
quadroone
old
playmate
after
so
many
years
they
sat
down
side
by
side
like
husband
and
wife
the
priest
playing
with
the
other
hand
and
talked
of
times
and
seasons
past
often
mentioning
evariste
and
often
jean
madame
delphine
stopped
short
home
and
returned
to
père
jerome
his
entry
door
was
wide
open
and
the
parlor
door
ajar
she
passed
through
the
one
and
with
downcast
eyes
was
standing
at
the
other
her
hand
lifted
to
knock
when
the
door
was
drawn
open
and
the
white
duck
shoes
passed
out
she
saw
besides
this
time
the
blue
cottonade
suit
yes
the
voice
of
père
jerome
was
saying
as
his
face
appeared
in
the
door
ah
madame
i
lef
my
said
madame
delphine
in
english
there
was
this
quiet
evidence
of
a
defiant
spirit
hidden
somewhere
down
under
her
general
timidity
that
against
a
fierce
conventional
prohibition
she
wore
a
bonnet
instead
of
the
turban
of
her
caste
and
carried
a
parasol
père
jerome
turned
and
brought
it
he
made
a
motion
in
the
direction
in
which
the
late
visitor
had
disappeared
madame
delphine
you
saw
dat
man
not
his
face

couldn
billieve
me

i
tell
you
dat
man

so
père
jerome
he
goin
to
hopen
a
bank
ah
said
madame
delphine
seeing
she
was
expected
to
be
astonished
père
jerome
evidently
longed
to
tell
something
that
was
best
kept
secret
he
repressed
the
impulse
but
his
heart
had
to
say
something
he
threw
forward
one
hand
and
looking
pleasantly
at
madame
delphine
with
his
lips
dropped
apart
clenched
his
extended
hand
and
thrusting
it
toward
the
ground
said
in
a
solemn
undertone
he
is
god
own
banker
madame
delphine
chapter
vii
miché
vignevielle
madame
delphine
sold
one
of
the
corner
lots
of
her
property
she
had
almost
no
revenue
and
now
and
then
a
piece
had
to
go
as
a
consequence
of
the
sale
she
had
a
few
large
sewed
up
in
her
petticoat
and
one
day
maybe
a
fortnight
after
her
tearful
interview
with
père
jerome
she
found
it
necessary
to
get
one
of
these
changed
into
small
money
she
was
in
the
rue
toulouse
looking
from
one
side
to
the
other
for
a
bank
which
was
not
in
that
street
at
all
when
she
noticed
a
small
sign
hanging
above
a
door
bearing
the
name
vignevielle
she
looked
in
père
jerome
had
told
her
when
she
had
gone
to
him
to
ask
where
she
should
apply
for
change
that
if
she
could
only
wait
a
few
days
there
would
be
a
new
concern
opened
in
toulouse
street
it
really
seemed
as
if
vignevielle
was
the
name
if
she
could
judge
it
looked
to
be
and
it
was
a
private
banker
vignevielle
according
to
a
larger
inscription
which
met
her
eyes
as
she
ventured
in
behind
the
counter
exchanging
some
last
words
with
a
man
outside
who
in
withdrawing
seemed
bent
on
running
over
madame
delphine
stood
the
man
in
blue
cottonade
whom
she
had
met
in
père
jerome
doorway
now
for
the
first
time
she
saw
his
face
its
strong
grave
human
kindness
shining
softly
on
each
and
every
bronzed
feature
the
recognition
was
mutual
he
took
pains
to
speak
first
saying
in
a
tone
and
in
the
language
he
had
last
heard
her
use
i
kin
serve

miché
she
pulled
from
her
pocket
a
wad
of
dark
cotton
handkerchief
from
which
she
began
to
untie
the
imprisoned
note
madame
delphine
had
an
uncommonly
sweet
voice
and
it
seemed
so
to
strike
monsieur
vignevielle
he
spoke
to
her
once
or
twice
more
as
he
waited
on
her
each
time
in
english
as
though
he
enjoyed
the
humble
melody
of
its
tone
and
presently
as
she
turned
to
go
he
said
madame
carraze
she
started
a
little
but
bethought
herself
instantly
that
he
had
heard
her
name
in
père
jerome
parlor
the
good
father
might
even
have
said
a
few
words
about
her
after
her
first
departure
he
had
such
an
overflowing
heart
madame
carraze
said
monsieur

he
drew
from
his
a
note
resembling
the
one
he
had
just
changed
for
her
and
proceeded
to
point
out
certain
tests
of
genuineness
the
counterfeit
he
said
was
so
and
so
bud
she
exclaimed
with
much
dismay

to

in
conversation
with
an
employé
and
a
new
visitor
and
gave
no
sign
of
hearing
madame
delphine
voice
she
asked
a
second
time
with
like
result
lingered
timidly
and
as
he
turned
to
give
his
attention
to
a
third
visitor
reiterated
miché

he
said
turning
so
suddenly
as
to
make
the
frightened
little
woman
start
but
extending
his
palm
with
a
show
of
frankness
and
assuming
a
look
of
benignant
patience

troub
the
dimmest
shadow
of
a
smile
seemed
only
to
give
his
words
a
more
kindly
authoritative
import
and
as
he
turned
away
again
with
a
manner
suggestive
of
finality
madame
delphine
found
no
choice
but
to
depart
but
she
went
away
loving
the
ground
beneath
the
feet
of
monsieur
vignevielle
oh
père
jerome
she
exclaimed
in
the
corrupt
french
of
her
caste
meeting
the
little
father
on
the
street
a
few
days
later
you
told
the
truth
that
day
in
your
parlor

he
is
just
what
you
called
him
why
do
you
not

banker
also
madame
delphine
i
have
done
so
this
very
day
she
replied
with
more
happiness
in
her
eyes
than
père
jerome
had
ever
before
seen
there
madame
delphine
he
said
his
own
eyes
sparkling
make
your
daughter
guardian
for
myself
being
a
priest
it
would
not
be
best
but
ask
him
i
believe
he
will
not
refuse
you
madame
delphine
face
grew
still
brighter
as
he
spoke
it
was
in
my
mind
she
said
yet
to
the
timorous
madame
delphine
many
trifles
became
one
after
another
an
impediment
to
the
making
of
this
proposal
and
many
weeks
elapsed
before
further
delay
was
positively
without
excuse
but
at
length
one
day
in
may
in
a
small
private
office
behind
monsieur
vignevielle
he
sitting
beside
a
table
and
she
more
timid
and
demure
than
ever
having
just
taken
a
chair
by
the
door
she
said
trying
with
a
little
bashful
laugh
to
make
the
matter
seem
unimportant
and
yet
with
some
tremor
of
voice
miché

she
looked
up
with
grateful
but
her
eyes
dropped
again
as
she
said
miché
vignevielle
here
she
choked
and
began
her
peculiar
motion
of
laying
folds
in
the
skirt
of
her
dress
with
trembling
fingers
she
lifted
her
eyes
and
as
they
met
the
look
of
deep
and
placid
kindness
that
was
in
his
face
some
courage
returned
and
she
said

there

to

the

waited
in
silence
i

you
will
want

he
smiled
for
she
looked
at

as

parting
smile
she
went
very
shortly
was
gratitude
beyond
speech
monsieur
vignevielle
returned
to
the
seat
he
had
left
and
resumed
a
newspaper
the
in
all
probability
which
he
had
laid
down
upon
madame
delphine
entrance
his
eyes
fell
upon
a
paragraph
which
had
previously
escaped
his
notice
there
they
rested
either
he
read
it
over
and
over
unwearyingly
or
he
was
lost
in
thought
jean
thompson
entered
now
said
thompson
in
a
suppressed
tone
bending
a
little
across
the
table
and
laying
one
palm
upon
a
package
of
papers
which
lay
in
the
other
it
is
completed
you
could
retire
from
your
business
any
day
inside
of
six
hours
without
loss
to
anybody
both
here
and
elsewhere
let
it
be
understood
that
where
good
english
is
given
the
words
were
spoken
in
good
french
monsieur
vignevielle
raised
his
eyes
and
extended
the
newspaper
to
the
attorney
who
received
it
and
read
the
paragraph
its
substance
was
that
a
certain
vessel
of
the
navy
had
returned
from
a
cruise
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
straits
of
florida
where
she
had
done
valuable
service
against
the
pirates
having
for
instance
destroyed
in
one
fortnight
in
january
last
twelve
pirate
vessels
afloat
two
on
the
stocks
and
three
establishments
ashore
united
states
brig
repeated
jean
thompson
do
you
know
her
we
are
acquainted
said
monsieur
vignevielle
chapter
viii
she
a
quiet
footstep
a
grave
new
presence
on
financial
sidewalks
a
neat
garb
slightly
out
of
date
a
gently
strong
and
kindly
pensive
face
a
silent
bow
a
new
sign
in
the
rue
toulouse
a
lone
figure
with
a
cane
walking
in
meditation
in
the
evening
light
under
the
willows
of
canal
marigny
a
window
in
the
rue
conti
these
were
all
a
fall
of
dew
would
scarce
have
been
more
quiet
than
was
the
return
of
ursin
to
the
precincts
of
his
birth
and
early
life
but
we
hardly
give
the
event
its
right
name
it
was
capitaine
lemaìtre
who
had
disappeared
it
was
monsieur
vignevielle
who
had
come
back
the
pleasures
the
haunts
the
companions
that
had
once
held
out
their
charms
to
the
impetuous
youth
offered
no
enticements
to
madame
delphine
banker
there
is
this
to
be
said
even
for
the
pride
his
grandfather
had
taught
him
that
it
had
always
hald
him
above
low
indulgences
and
though
he
had
dallied
with
kings
queens
and
knaves
through
all
the
mazes
of
faro
rondeau
and
craps
he
had
done
it
loftily
but
now
he
maintained
a
peaceful
estrangement
from
all
evariste
and
jean
themselves
found
him
only
by
seeking
it
is
the
right
way
he
said
to
père
jerome
the
day
we
saw
him
there
ursin
lemaìtre
is
dead
i
have
buried
him
he
left
a
will
i
am
his
executor
he
is
crazy
said
his
lawyer
impatiently
on
the
replied
the
little
priest
come
ad
evariste
spoke
look
at
his
face
jean
men
with
that
kind
of
face
are
the
last
to
go
crazy
you
have
not
proved
that
replied
jean
with
an
attorney
obstinacy
you
should
have
heard
him
talk
the
other
day
about
that
newspaper
paragraph
i
have
taken
ursin
lemaitre
head
i
have
it
with
me
i
claim
the
reward
but
i
desire
to
commute
it
to
citizenship
he
is
crazy
of
course
jean
thompson
did
not
believe
what
he
said
but
he
said
it
and
in
his
vexation
repeated
it
on
the
and
at
the
clubs
and
presently
it
took
the
shape
of
a
sly
rumor
that
the
returned
rover
was
a
trifle
snarled
in
his
this
whisper
was
helped
into
circulation
by
many
trivial
eccentricities
of
manner
and
by
the
unaccountable
oddness
of
some
of
his
transactions
in
business
my
dear
sir
cried
his
astounded
lawyer
one
day
you
are
not
running
a
charitable
institution
how
do
you
know
said
monsieur
vignevielle
there
the
conversation
ceased
why
do
you
not
found
hospitals
and
asylums
at
once
asked
the
attorney
at
another
time
with
a
vexed
laugh
and
get
the
credit
of
it
and
make
the
end
worse
than
the
beginning
said
the
banker
with
a
gentle
smile
turning
away
to
a
desk
of
books
bah
muttered
jean
thompson
monsieur
vignevielle
betrayed
one
very
bad
symptom
wherever
he
went
he
seemed
looking
for
somebody
it
may
have
been
perceptible
only
to
those
who
were
sufficiently
interested
in
him
to
study
his
movements
but
those
who
saw
it
once
saw
it
always
he
never
passed
an
open
door
or
gate
but
he
glanced
in
and
often
where
it
stood
but
slightly
ajar
you
might
see
him
give
it
a
gentle
push
with
his
hand
or
cane
it
was
very
singular
he
walked
much
alone
after
dark
the
garroters
we
might
say
at
those
times
the
city
particular
terror
by
night
never
crossed
his
path
he
was
one
of
those
men
for
whom
danger
appears
to
stand
aside
one
beautiful
summer
night
when
all
nature
seemed
hushed
in
ecstasy
the
last
blush
gone
that
told
of
the
sun
parting
monsieur
vignevielle
in
the
course
of
one
of
those
contemplative
uncompanioned
walks
which
it
was
his
habit
to
take
came
slowly
along
the
more
open
portion
of
the
rue
royale
with
a
step
which
was
soft
without
intention
occasionally
touching
the
end
of
his
stout
cane
gently
to
the
ground
and
looking
upward
among
his
old
acquaintances
the
stars
it
was
one
of
those
southern
nights
under
whose
spell
all
the
sterner
energies
of
the
mind
cloak
themselves
and
lie
down
in
bivouac
and
the
fancy
and
the
imagination
that
can
not
sleep
slip
their
fetters
and
escape
beckoned
away
from
behind
every
flowering
bush
and
tree
and
every
stretch
of
lonely
walk
by
the
genius
of
poetry
the
air
stirred
softly
now
and
then
and
was
still
again
as
if
the
breezes
lifted
their
expectant
pinions
and
lowered
them
once
more
awaiting
the
rising
of
the
moon
in
a
silence
which
fell
upon
the
fields
the
roads
the
gardens
the
walls
and
the
suburban
and
streets
like
a
pause
in
worship
and
anon
she
rose
monsieur
vignevielle
steps
were
bent
toward
the
more
central
part
of
the
town
and
he
was
presently
passing
along
a
high
close
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
way
when
just
within
this
enclosure
and
almost
overhead
in
the
dark
boughs
of
a
large
a
began
the
first
low
of
his
song
it
may
have
been
only
the
nearness
of
the
songster
that
attracted
the
passer
attention
but
he
paused
and
looked
up
and
then
he
remarked
something
more
that
the
air
where
he
had
stopped
was
filled
with
the
overpowering
sweetness
of
the
he
looked
around
it
could
only
be
inside
the
fence
there
was
a
gate
just
there
would
he
push
it
as
his
wont
was
the
grass
was
growing
about
it
in
a
thick
turf
as
though
the
entrance
had
not
been
used
for
years
an
iron
staple
clasped
the
and
was
driven
deep
into
the
but
now
an
eye
that
had
been
in
the
blacksmithing
business
an
eye
which
had
later
received
high
training
as
an
eye
for
fastenings
fell
upon
that
staple
and
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
wood
had
shrunk
from
it
and
it
had
sprung
from
its
hold
though
without
falling
out
the
strange
habit
asserted
itself
he
laid
his
large
hand
upon
the
the
turf
at
the
base
yielded
and
the
tall
gate
was
drawn
partly
open
at
that
moment
as
at
the
moment
whenever
he
drew
or
pushed
a
door
or
gate
or
looked
in
at
a
window
he
was
thinking
of
one
the
image
of
whose
face
and
form
had
never
left
his
inner
vision
since
the
day
it
had
met
him
in
his
life
path
and
turned
him
face
about
from
the
way
of
destruction
the
bird
ceased
the
cause
of
the
interruption
standing
within
the
opening
saw
before
him
much
obscured
by
its
own
numerous
shadows
a
broad
garden
among
whose
untrimmed
and
tangled
vines
and
often
also
in
its
old
walks
of
pounded
shell
the
and
had
spread
riotously
and
sturdy
weeds
stood
up
in
bloom
he
stepped
in
and
drew
the
gate
to
after
him
there
very
near
by
was
the
clump
of
jasmine
whose
ravishing
odor
had
tempted
him
it
stood
just
beyond
a
brightly
moonlit
path
which
turned
from
him
in
a
curve
toward
the
residence
a
little
distance
to
the
right
and
escaped
the
view
at
a
point
where
it
seemed
more
than
likely
a
door
of
the
house
might
open
upon
it
while
he
still
looked
there
fell
upon
his
ear
from
around
that
curve
a
light
footstep
on
the
broken
shells
one
only
and
then
all
was
for
a
moment
still
again
had
he
mistaken
no
the
same
soft
click
was
repeated
nearer
by
a
pale
glimpse
of
robes
came
through
the
tangle
and
then
plainly
to
view
appeared
an
outline
a
presence
a
form
a
spirit
a
girl
from
throat
to
instep
she
was
as
white
as
cynthia
something
above
the
medium
height
slender
lithe
her
abundant
hair
rolling
in
dark
rich
waves
back
from
her
brows
and
down
from
her
crown
and
falling
in
two
heavy
plaits
beyond
her
round
broadly
girt
waist
and
full
to
her
knees
a
few
escaping
locks
eddying
lightly
on
her
graceful
neck
and
her
temples
her
arms
half
hid
in
a
snowy
mist
of
sleeve
let
down
to
guide
her
spotless
skirts
free
from
the
dewy
touch
of
the
grass
straight
down
the
path
she
came
will
she
stop
will
she
turn
aside
will
she
espy
the
dark
form
in
the
deep
shade
of
the
orange
and
with
one
piercing
scream
wheel
and
vanish
she
draws
near
she
approaches
the
jasmine
she
raises
her
arms
the
sleeves
falling
like
a
vapor
down
to
the
shoulders
rises
upon
tiptoe
and
plucks
a
spray
o
memory
can
it
be
it
is
this
his
quest
or
is
it
lunacy
the
ground
seems
to
monsieur
vignevielle
the
unsteady
sea
and
he
to
stand
once
more
on
a
deck
and
she
as
she
is
now
if
she
but
turn
toward
the
orange
the
whole
glory
of
the
moon
will
shine
upon
her
face
his
heart
stands
still
he
is
waiting
for
her
to
do
that
she
reaches
up
again
this
time
a
bunch
for
her
mother
that
neck
and
throat
now
she
fastens
a
spray
in
her
hair
the
mockingbird
can
not
withhold
he
breaks
into
song
she
turns
she
turns
her
face
it
is
she
it
is
she
madame
delphine
daughter
is
the
girl
he
met
on
the
ship
chapter
ix
olive
she
was
just
passing
seventeen
that
beautiful
year
when
the
heart
of
the
maiden
still
beats
quickly
with
the
surprise
of
her
new
dominion
while
with
gentle
dignity
her
brow
accepts
the
holy
coronation
of
womanhood
the
forehead
and
temples
beneath
her
loosely
bound
hair
were
fair
without
paleness
and
meek
without
languor
she
had
the
soft
beauty
of
the
south
no
ruddiness
of
coral
no
waxen
white
no
pink
of
shell
no
heavenly
blue
in
the
glance
but
a
face
that
seemed
in
all
its
other
beauties
only
a
tender
accompaniment
for
the
large
brown
melting
eyes
where
the
openness
of
mingled
dreamily
with
the
sweet
mysteries
of
maiden
thought
we
say
no
color
of
shell
on
face
or
throat
but
this
was
no
deficiency
that
which
took
its
place
being
the
warm
transparent
tint
of
sculptured
ivory
this
side
doorway
which
led
from
madame
delphine
house
into
her
garden
was
partly
by
an
old
remnant
of
lattice
and
partly
by
a
against
whose
small
polished
trunk
leaned
a
rustic
seat
here
madame
delphine
and
olive
loved
to
sit
when
the
twilights
were
balmy
or
the
moon
was
bright
said
madame
delphine
on
one
of
those
evenings
why
do
you
dream
so
much
she
spoke
in
the
most
natural
to
her
and
which
her
daughter
had
easily
learned
the
girl
turned
her
face
to
her
mother
and
smiled
then
dropped
her
glance
to
the
hands
in
her
own
lap
which
were
listlessly
handling
the
end
of
a
ribbon
the
mother
looked
at
her
with
fond
solicitude
her
dress
was
white
again
this
was
but
one
night
since
that
in
which
monsieur
vignevielle
had
seen
her
at
the
bush
of
he
had
not
been
discovered
but
had
gone
away
shutting
the
gate
and
leaving
it
as
he
had
found
it
her
head
was
uncovered
its
plaited
masses
quite
black
in
the
moonlight
hung
down
and
coiled
upon
the
bench
by
her
side
her
chaste
drapery
was
of
that
revived
classic
order
which
the
world
of
fashion
was
again
laying
aside
to
the
medaeval
bondage
of
the
staylace
for
new
orleans
was
behind
the
fashionable
world
and
madame
delphine
and
her
daughter
were
behind
new
orleans
a
delicate
scarf
pale
blue
of
lightly
netted
worsted
fell
from
either
shoulder
down
beside
her
hands
the
look
that
was
bent
upon
her
changed
perforce
to
one
of
gentle
admiration
she
seemed
the
goddess
of
the
garden
olive
glanced
up
madame
delphine
was
not
prepared
for
the
movement
and
on
that
account
repeated
her
question
what
are
you
thinking
about
the
dreamer
took
the
hand
that
was
laid
upon
hers
between
her
own
palms
bowed
her
head
and
gave
them
a
soft
kiss
the
mother
submitted
wherefore
in
the
silence
which
followed
a
daughter
conscience
felt
the
burden
of
having
withheld
an
answer
and
olive
presently
said
as
the
pair
sat
looking
up
into
the
sky
i
was
thinking
of
père
jerome
sermon
madame
delphine
had
feared
so
olive
had
lived
on
it
ever
since
the
day
it
was
preached
the
poor
mother
was
almost
ready
to
repent
having
ever
afforded
her
the
opportunity
of
hearing
it
meat
and
drink
had
become
of
secondary
value
to
her
daughter
she
fed
upon
the
sermon
olive
felt
her
mother
thought
and
knew
that
her
mother
knew
her
own
but
now
that
she
had
confessed
she
would
ask
a
question
do
you
think
that
père
jerome
knows
it
was
i
who
gave
that
missal
no
said
madame
delphine
i
am
sure
he
does
not
another
question
came
more
timidly
do
do
you
think
he
knows
yes
i
do
he
said
in
his
sermon
he
did
both
remained
for
a
long
time
very
still
watching
the
moon
gliding
in
and
through
among
the
small
clouds
at
last
the
daughter
spoke
again
i
wish
i
was
père
i
wish
i
was
as
good
as
père
jerome
my
child
said
madame
delphine
her
tone
betraying
a
painful
summoning
of
strength
to
say
what
she
had
lacked
the
courage
to
utter
my
child
i
pray
the
good
god
you
will
not
let
your
heart
go
after
one
whom
you
may
never
see
in
this
world
the
maiden
turned
her
glance
and
their
eyes
met
she
cast
her
arms
about
her
mother
neck
laid
her
cheek
upon
it
for
a
moment
and
then
feeling
the
maternal
tear
lifted
her
lips
and
kissing
her
said
i
will
not
i
will
not
but
the
voice
was
one
not
of
willing
consent
but
of
desperate
resolution
it
would
be
useless
anyhow
said
the
mother
laying
her
arm
around
her
daughter
waist
olive
repeated
the
kiss
prolonging
it
passionately
i
have
nobody
but
you
murmured
the
girl
i
am
a
poor
quadroone
she
threw
back
her
plaited
hair
for
a
third
embrace
when
a
sound
in
the
shrubbery
startled
them
ci
pa
called
madame
delphine
in
a
frightened
voice
as
the
two
stood
up
holding
to
each
other
no
answer
it
was
only
the
dropping
of
a
twig
she
whispered
after
a
long
holding
of
the
breath
but
they
went
into
the
house
and
barred
it
everywhere
it
was
no
longer
pleasant
to
sit
up
they
retired
and
in
course
of
time
but
not
soon
they
fell
asleep
holding
each
other
very
tight
and
fearing
even
in
their
dreams
to
hear
another
twig
fall

monsieur
vigneville
looked
in
at
no
more
doors
or
windows
but
if
the
disappearance
of
this
symptom
was
a
favorable
sign
others
came
to
notice
which
were
especially
bad
for
instance
wakefulness
at
any
hour
of
the
night
the
city
guard
which
itself
dared
not
patrol
singly
would
meet
him
on
his
slow
unmolested
walk
seems
to
enjoy
it
said
jean
thompson
the
worst
sort
of
evidence
if
he
showed
distress
of
mind
it
would
not
be
so
bad
but
his
calmness
ugly
feature
the
attorney
had
held
his
ground
so
long
that
he
began
really
to
believe
it
was
tenable
by
day
it
is
true
monsieur
vignevielle
was
at
his
post
in
his
quiet
bank
yet
here
day
by
day
he
was
the
source
of
more
and
more
vivid
astonishment
to
those
who
held
preconceived
notions
of
a
calling
as
a
banker
at
least
he
was
certainly
out
of
balance
while
as
a
promenader
it
seemed
to
those
who
watched
him
that
his
ruling
idea
had
now
veered
about
and
that
of
late
he
was
ever
on
the
quiet
alert
not
to
find
but
to
evade
somebody
olive
my
child
whispered
madame
delphine
one
morning
as
the
pair
were
kneeling
side
by
side
on
the
tiled
floor
of
the
church
yonder
is
miché
vignevielle
if
you
will
only
look
at
once
he
is
just
passing
a
little
in
ah
much
too
slow
again
he
stepped
out
by
the
side
door
the
mother
thought
it
a
strange
providence
that
monsieur
vignevielle
should
always
be
disappearing
whenever
olive
was
with
her
one
early
dawn
madame
delphine
with
a
small
empty
basket
on
her
arm
stepped
out
upon
the
in
front
of
her
house
shut
and
fastened
the
door
very
softly
and
stole
out
in
the
direction
whence
you
could
faintly
catch
in
the
stillness
of
the
daybreak
the
songs
of
the
gascon
butchers
and
the
pounding
of
their
on
the
stalls
of
the
distant
she
was
going
to
see
if
she
could
find
some
birds
for
olive
the
child
appetite
was
so
poor
and
as
she
was
out
she
would
drop
an
early
prayer
at
the
cathedral
faith
and
works
one
must
venture
something
sometimes
in
the
cause
of
religion
thought
she
as
she
started
timorously
on
her
way
but
she
had
not
gone
a
dozen
steps
before
she
repented
her
temerity
there
was
some
one
behind
her
there
should
not
be
any
thing
terrible
in
a
footstep
merely
because
it
is
masculine
but
madame
delphine
mind
was
not
prepared
to
consider
that
a
terrible
secret
was
haunting
her
yesterday
morning
she
had
found
a
in
the
garden
she
had
not
disclosed
the
discovery
to
olive
but
she
had
hardly
closed
her
eyes
the
whole
night
the
step
behind
her
now
might
be
the
fall
of
that
very
shoe
she
quickened
her
pace
but
did
not
leave
the
sound
behind
she
hurried
forward
almost
at
a
run
yet
it
was
still
there
no
farther
no
nearer
two
frights
were
upon
her
at
once
one
for
herself
another
for
olive
left
alone
in
the
house
but
she
had
but
the
one
prayer
god
protect
my
child
after
a
fearful
time
she
reached
a
place
of
safety
the
cathedral
there
panting
she
knelt
long
enough
to
know
the
pursuit
was
at
least
suspended
and
then
arose
hoping
and
praying
all
the
saints
that
she
might
find
the
way
clear
for
her
return
in
all
haste
to
olive
she
approached
a
different
door
from
that
by
which
she
had
entered
her
eyes
in
all
directions
and
her
heart
in
her
throat
madame
carraze
she
started
wildly
and
almost
screamed
though
the
voice
was
soft
and
mild
monsieur
vignevielle
came
slowly
forward
from
the
shade
of
the
wall
they
met
beside
a
bench
upon
which
she
dropped
her
basket

and
drew
sweet
reassurance
from
them

bit

and
suddenly
dropped

down
upon

bench
and
wept

madame
delphine
was
a
helpless
timid
thing
but
her
eyes
showed
she
was
about
to
resent
this
offer
monsieur
vignevielle
put
forth
his
hand
it
touched
her
shoulder
and
said
kindly

and
without
eagerness

followed

dropped
into
a
chair
covered
her
face
with
her
apron
and
burst
into
tears
then
looked
up
with
an
effort
to
smile
and
wept
afresh
what
have
you
been
doing
asked
the
daughter
in
a
fondling
tone
she
leaned
forward
and
unfastened
her
why
do
you
cry
for
nothing
at

my

for

i

such
a

the
girl
eyes
filled
the
mother
looked
up
into
her
face
and
said
no
it
is
nothing
nothing
only
that
turning
her
head
from
side
to
side
with
a
slow
emotional
emphasis
miché

the
best

olive
drew
a
chair
close
to
her
mother
sat
down
and
took
the
little
yellow
hands
into
her
own
white
lap
and
looked
tenderly
into
her
eyes
madame
delphine
felt
herself
yielding
she
must
make
a
show
of
telling
something
he
sent
you
those
birds
the
girl
drew
her
face
back
a
little
the
little
woman
turned
away
trying
in
vain
to
hide
her
tearful
smile
and
they
laughed
together
olive
mingling
a
daughter
fond
kiss
with
her
laughter
there
is
something
else
she
said
and
you
shall
tell
me
yes
replied
madame
delphine
only
let
me
get
composed
but
she
did
not
get
so
later
in
the
morning
she
came
to
olive
with
the
timid
yet
startling
proposal
that
they
would
do
what
they
could
to
brighten
up
the
front
room
olive
was
mystified
and
troubled
but
consented
and
thereupon
the
mother
spirits
rose
the
work
began
and
presently
ensued
all
the
thumping
the
trundling
the
lifting
and
letting
down
the
raising
and
swallowing
of
dust
and
the
smells
of
turpentine
brass
pumice
and
woollen
rags
that
go
to
characterize
a
housekeeper
and
still
as
the
work
progressed
madame
delphine
heart
grew
light
and
her
little
black
eyes
sparkled
we
like
a
clean
parlor
my
daughter
even
though
no
one
is
ever
coming
to
see
us
eh
she
said
as
entering
the
apartment
she
at
last
sat
down
late
in
the
afternoon
she
had
put
on
her
best
attire
olive
was
not
there
to
reply
the
mother
called
but
got
no
answer
she
rose
with
an
uneasy
heart
and
met
her
a
few
steps
beyond
the
door
that
opened
into
the
garden
in
a
path
which
came
up
from
an
old
latticed
bower
olive
was
approaching
slowly
her
face
pale
and
wild
there
was
an
agony
of
hostile
dismay
in
the
look
and
the
trembling
and
appealing
tone
with
which
taking
the
frightened
mother
cheeks
between
her
palms
she
said
ma
mère
qui
vini
ce
who
is
coming
here
this
evening
why
my
dear
child
i
was
just
saying
we
like
a
clean
but
the
daughter
was
desperate
oh
tell
me
my
mother
is
coming
my
darling
it
is
our
blessed
friend
miché
vignevielle
to
see
me
cried
the
girl
yes
oh
my
mother
what
have
you
done
why
olive
my
child
exclaimed
the
little
mother
bursting
into
tears
do
you
forget
it
is
miché
vignevielle
who
has
promised
to
protect
you
when
i
die
the
daughter
had
turned
away
and
entered
the
door
but
she
faced
around
again
and
extending
her
arms
toward
her
mother
cried
how
can
he
is
a
white
man
i
am
a
poor
ah
replied
madame
delphine
seizing
the
outstretched
hands
it
is
there
it
is
there
that
he
shows
himself
the
best
man
alive
he
sees
that
difficulty
he
proposes
to
meet
it
he
says
he
will
find
you
a
suitor
olive
freed
her
hands
violently
motioned
her
mother
back
and
stood
proudly
drawn
up
flashing
an
indignation
too
great
for
speech
but
the
next
moment
she
had
uttered
a
cry
and
was
sobbing
on
the
floor
the
mother
knelt
beside
her
and
threw
an
arm
about
her
shoulders
oh
my
sweet
daughter
you
must
not
cry
i
did
not
want
to
tell
you
at
all
i
did
not
want
to
tell
you
it
is
fair
for
you
to
cry
so
hard
miché
vignevielle
says
you
shall
have
the
one
you
wish
or
none
at
all
olive
or
none
at
all
none
at
all
none
at
all
none
none
none
no
no
olive
said
the
mother
none
at
all
he
brings
none
with
him
and
shall
bring
none
with
him
hereafter
olive
rose
suddenly
silently
declined
her
mother
aid
and
went
alone
to
their
chamber
in
the
madame
delphine
wandered
drearily
from
door
to
window
from
window
to
door
and
presently
into
the
front
room
which
now
seemed
dismal
beyond
degree
there
was
a
great
argand
lamp
in
one
corner
how
she
had
labored
that
day
to
prepare
it
for
evening
illumination
a
little
beyond
it
on
the
wall
hung
a
crucifix
she
knelt
under
it
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
it
and
thus
silently
remained
until
its
outline
was
indistinguishable
in
the
deepening
shadows
of
evening
she
arose
a
few
minutes
later
as
she
was
trying
to
light
the
lamp
an
approaching
step
on
the
sidewalk
seemed
to
pause
her
heart
stood
still
she
softly
laid
the
out
of
her
hands
a
shoe
grated
softly
on
the
stone
step
and
madame
delphine
her
heart
beating
in
great
thuds
without
waiting
for
a
knock
opened
the
door
bowed
low
and
exclaimed
in
a
soft
perturbed
voice
miché
vignevielle
he
entered
hat
in
hand
and
with
that
almost
noiseless
tread
which
we
have
noticed
she
gave
him
a
chair
and
closed
the
door
then
hastened
with
words
of
apology
back
to
her
task
of
lighting
the
lamp
but
her
hands
paused
in
their
work
again
olive
step
was
on
the
stairs
then
it
came
off
the
stairs
then
it
was
in
the
next
room
and
then
there
was
the
whisper
of
soft
robes
a
breath
of
gentle
perfume
and
a
snowy
figure
in
the
door
she
was
dressed
for
the
evening
maman
madame
delphine
was
struggling
desperately
with
the
lamp
and
at
that
moment
it
responded
with
a
tiny
bead
of
light
i
am
here
my
daughter
she
hastened
to
the
door
and
olive
all
unaware
of
a
third
presence
lifted
her
white
arms
laid
them
about
her
mother
neck
and
ignoring
her
effort
to
speak
wrested
a
fervent
kiss
from
her
lips
the
crystal
of
the
lamp
sent
out
a
faint
gleam
it
grew
it
spread
on
every
side
the
ceiling
the
walls
lighted
up
the
crucifix
the
furniture
of
the
room
came
back
into
shape
maman
cried
olive
with
a
tremor
of
consternation
it
is
miché
vignevielle
my
daughter
the
gloom
melted
swiftly
away
before
the
eyes
of
the
startled
maiden
a
dark
form
stood
out
against
the
farther
wall
and
the
light
expanding
to
the
full
shone
clearly
upon
the
unmoving
figure
and
quiet
face
of
capitaine
lemaitre
chapter
xii
the
mother
bird
one
afternoon
some
three
weeks
after
capitaine
lemaitre
had
called
on
madame
delphine
the
priest
started
to
make
a
pastoral
call
and
had
hardly
left
the
gate
of
his
cottage
when
a
person
overtaking
him
plucked
his
gown
père
jerome
he
turned
the
face
that
met
his
was
so
changed
with
excitement
and
distress
that
for
an
instant
he
did
not
recognize
it
why
madame
delphine
oh
père
jerome
i
wan
see

so
bad
so
bad
oulé
dit
i
godd
some
to

two
languages
might
be
more
successful
than
one
she
seemed
to
think
we
had
better
go
back
to
my
parlor
said
the
priest
in
their
native
tongue
they
returned
madame
delphine
very
step
was
altered
nervous
and
inelastic
she
swung
one
arm
as
she
walked
and
brandished
a
fan
i
was
glad
yass
to
kedge
you
she
said
as
they
mounted
the
front
outdoor
stair
following
her
speech
with
a
slight
unmusical
laugh
and
fanning
herself
with
unconscious
fury
she
remarked
again
taking
the
chair
he
offered
and
continuing
to
ply
the
fan
père
jerome
laid
his
hat
upon
a
chest
of
drawers
sat
down
opposite
her
and
said
as
he
wiped
his
kindly
face
well
madame
carraze
gentle
as
the
tone
was
she
started
ceased
fanning
lowered
the
fan
to
her
knee
and
commenced
smoothing
its
feathers
père
jerome
she
gnawed
her
lip
and
shook
her
head
well
she
burst
into
tears
the
priest
rose
and
loosed
the
curtain
of
one
of
the
windows
he
did
it
slowly
as
slowly
as
he
could
and
as
he
came
back
she
lifted
her
face
with
sudden
energy
and
exclaimed
oh
père
jerome
de
law
is
brogue
de
law
is
brogue
i
brogue
it
was
me
was
me
the
tears
gushed
out
again
but
she
shut
her
lips
very
tight
and
dumbly
turned
away
her
face
père
jerome
waited
a
little
before
replying
then
he
said
very
gently
i
suppose
dad
muss
been
by
accyden
madame
delphine
the
little
father
felt
a
wish
one
which
he
often
had
when
weeping
women
were
before
him
that
he
were
an
angel
instead
of
a
man
long
enough
to
press
the
tearful
cheek
upon
his
breast
and
assure
the
weeper
god
would
not
let
the
lawyers
and
judges
hurt
her
he
allowed
a
few
moments
more
to
pass
and
then
asked
madame
delphine

ze
way

père
jerome
no
my
daughter
oh
père
jerome
i
bethroath

and
immediately
madame
delphine
commenced
savagely
drawing
a
thread
in
the
fabric
of
her
skirt
with
one
trembling
hand
while
she
drove
the
fan
with
the
other
dey
goin
git

on
the
priest
face
came
a
look
of
pained
surprise
he
slowly
said
is
dad
possib
madame
delphine
yass
she
replied
at
first
without
lifting
her
eyes
and
then
again
yass
looking
full
upon
him
through
her
tears
yaas
is
tru
he
rose
and
walked
once
across
the
room
returned
and
said
in
the
creole
dialect
is
he
a
good
man
without
doubt
de
bez

replied
madame
delphine
with
a
rapturous
smile
my
poor
dear
friend
said
the
priest
i
am
afraid
you
are
being
deceived
by
somebody
there
was
the
pride
of
an
unswerving
faith
in
the
triumphant
tone
and
smile
with
which
she
replied
raising
and
slowly
shaking
her
head
miché
no

père
jerome

confounded
he
turned
again
and
with
his
hands
at
his
back
and
his
eyes
cast
down
slowly
paced
the
floor
he
a
good
man
he
said
by
and
by
as
if
he
thought
aloud
at
length
he
halted
before
the
woman
madame
delphine
the
distressed
glance
with
which
she
had
been
following
his
steps
was
lifted
to
his
eyes

she
leaped
to
her
feet
as
if
he
had
smitten
her
and
putting
his
words
away
with
an
outstretched
arm
and
palm
suddenly
lifted
hands
and
eyes
to

and
cried

fierceness

law
is
a
fool
a
priest
of
less
might
have
replied
that
the
law
is
the
law
but
père
jerome
saw
that
madame
delphine
was
expecting
this
very
response
wherefore
he
said
with
gentleness
madame
delphine
a
priest
is
not
a
bailiff
but
a
physician
how
can
i
help
you
a
grateful
light
shone
a
moment
in
her
eyes
yet
there
remained
a
piteous
hostility
in
the
tone
in
which
she
demanded
yé
fé
cette
méchanique
là
what
business
had
they
to
make
that
contraption
his
answer
was
a
shrug
with
his
palms
extended
and
a
short
disclamatory
ah
he
started
to
resume
his
walk
but
turned
to
her
again
and
said
why
did
they
make
that
law
well
they
made
it
to
keep
the
two
races
separate
madame
delphine
startled
the
speaker
with
a
loud
harsh
angry
laugh
fire
came
from
her
eyes
and
her
lip
curled
with
scorn
then
they
made
a
lie
père
jerome
separate
they
do
not
want
to
keep
us
separated
no
no
but
they
want
to
keep
us
despised
she
laid
her
hand
on
her
heart
and
frowned
upward
with
physical
pain
but
very
well
from
which
race
do
they
want
to
keep
my
daughter
separate
she
is
seven
parts
white
the
law
did
not
stop
her
from
being
that
and
now
when
she
wants
to
be
a
white
man
good
and
honest
wife
shall
that
law
stop
her
oh

she
rose

i

for
it

made
to
punish
my
child
for
not
choosing
her
father
père
jerome
my
god
what
a
law
she
dropped
back
into
her
seat
the
tears
came
in
a
flood
which
she
made
no
attempt
to
restrain
no
she
began
again
and
here
she
broke
into
english

again
smiting
her
heaving

fan

père
jerome
had
heard
her
out
not
interrupting
by
so
much
as
a
motion
of
the
hand
now
his
decision
was
made
and
he
touched
her
softly
with
the
ends
of
his
fingers
madame
delphine
i
want
you
to

she
cried
with
a
gleam
of
joy
we

delphine
adieu
he
offered
his
hand
she
seized
and
kissed
it
thrice
covering
it
with
tears
at
the
same
time
lifting
up
her
eyes
to
his
and
murmuring
de
bez
man
god
evva
mague
at
the
door
she
turned
to
offer
a
more
conventional
but
he
was
following
her
out
bareheaded
at
the
gate
they
paused
an
instant
and
then
parted
with
a
simple
adieu
she
going
home
and
he
returning
for
his
hat
and
starting
again
upon
his
interrupted
business
before
he
came
back
to
his
own
house
he
stopped
at
the
lodgings
of
monsieur
vignevielle
but
did
not
find
him
in
indeed
the
servant
at
the
door
said
he
said
he
might
not
return
for
some
days
or
weeks
so
père
jerome
much
wondering
made
a
second
detour
toward
the
residence
of
one
of
monsieur
vignevielle
employés
yes
said
the
clerk
his
instructions
are
to
hold
the
business
as
far
as
practicable
in
suspense
during
his
absence
every
thing
is
in
another
name
and
then
he
whispered
officers
of
the
government
looking
for
him
information
got
from
some
of
the
prisoners
taken
months
ago
by
the
united
states
brig
but
a
still
softer
whisper
have
no
fear
they
will
never
find
him
jean
thompson
and
evariste
varrillat
have
hid
him
away
too
well
for
that
chapter
xiii
tribulation
the
saturday
following
was
a
very
beautiful
day
in
the
morning
a
light
fall
of
rain
had
passed
across
the
town
and
all
the
afternoon
you
could
see
signs
here
and
there
upon
the
horizon
of
other
showers
the
ground
was
dry
again
while
the
breeze
was
cool
and
sweet
smelling
of
wet
foliage
and
bringing
sunshine
and
shade
in
frequent
and
very
pleasing
alternation
there
was
a
walk
in
père
jerome
little
garden
of
which
we
have
not
spoken
off
on
the
right
side
of
the
cottage
with
his
chamber
window
at
one
end
a
few
old
and
twisted
but
on
either
hand
now
and
then
a
rose
of
some
unpretending
variety
and
some
bunches
of
rue
and
at
the
other
end
a
shrine
in
whose
blue
niche
stood
a
small
figure
of
mary
with
folded
hands
and
uplifted
eyes
no
other
window
looked
down
upon
the
spot
and
its
seclusion
was
often
a
great
comfort
to
père
jerome
up
and
down
this
path
but
a
few
steps
in
its
entire
length
the
priest
was
walking
taking
the
air
for
a
few
moments
after
a
prolonged
sitting
in
the
confessional
penitents
had
been
numerous
this
afternoon
he
was
thinking
of
ursin
the
officers
of
the
government
had
not
found
him
nor
had
père
jerome
seen
him
yet
he
believed
they
had
in
a
certain
indirect
way
devised
a
simple
project
by
which
they
could
at
any
time
figs
dad
law
providing
only
that
these
government
officials
would
give
over
their
search
for
though
he
had
not
seen
the
fugitive
madame
delphine
had
seen
him
and
had
been
the
vehicle
of
communication
between
them
there
was
an
where
a
was
wont
to
sing
and
a
girl
in
white
to
walk
that
the
detectives
wot
not
of
the
law
was
to
be
figs
by
the
departure
of
the
three
frequenters
of
the
garden
in
one
ship
to
france
where
the
law
offered
no
obstacles
it
seemed
moderately
certain
to
those
in
search
of
monsieur
vignevielle
and
it
was
true
that
jean
and
evariste
were
his
harborers
but
for
all
that
the
hunt
even
for
clews
was
vain
the
little
banking
establishment
had
not
been
disturbed
jean
thompson
had
told
the
searchers
certain
facts
about
it
and
about
its
gentle
proprietor
as
well
that
persuaded
them
to
make
no
move
against
the
concern
if
the
same
relations
did
not
even
induce
a
relaxation
of
their
efforts
for
his
personal
discovery
père
jerome
was
walking
to
and
fro
with
his
hands
behind
him
pondering
these
matters
he
had
paused
a
moment
at
the
end
of
the
walk
farthest
from
his
window
and
was
looking
around
upon
the
sky
when
turning
he
beheld
a
closely
veiled
female
figure
standing
at
the
other
end
and
knew
instantly
that
it
was
olive
she
came
forward
quickly
and
with
evident
eagerness
i
came
to
confession
she
said
breathing
hurriedly
the
excitement
in
her
eyes
shining
through
her
veil
but
i
find
i
am
too
late
there
is
no
too
late
or
too
early
for
that
i
am
always
ready
said
the
priest
but
how
is
your
mother
ah
her
voice
failed
more
trouble
ah
sir
i
have
made
trouble
oh
père
jerome
i
am
bringing
so
much
trouble
upon
my
poor
mother
père
jerome
moved
slowly
toward
the
house
with
his
eyes
cast
down
the
veiled
girl
at
his
side
it
is
not
your
fault
he
presently
said
and
after
another
pause
i
thought
it
was
all
arranged
he
looked
up
and
could
see
even
through
the
veil
her
crimson
blush
oh
no
she
replied
in
a
low
despairing
voice
dropping
her
face
what
is
the
difficulty
asked
the
priest
stopping
in
the
angle
of
the
path
where
it
turned
toward
the
front
of
the
house
she
averted
her
face
and
began
picking
the
thin
scales
of
bark
from
a
madame
thompson
and
her
husband
were
at
our
house
this
morning
had
told
monsieur
thompson
all
about
it
they
were
very
kind
to
me
at
first
but
they
tried
she
was
weeping
what
did
they
try
to
do
asked
the
priest
they
tried
to
make
me
believe
he
is
insane
she
succeeded
in
passing
her
handkerchief
up
under
her
veil
and
i
suppose
then
your
poor
mother
grew
angry
eh
yes
and
they
became
much
more
so
and
said
if
we
did
not
write
or
send
a
writing
to
within
hours
breaking
the
engagement
said
père
jerome
they
would
give
him
up
to
the
government
oh
père
jerome
what
shall
i
do
it
is
killing
my
mother
she
bowed
her
head
and
sobbed
where
is
your
mother
now
she
has
gone
to
see
monsieur
jean
thompson
she
says
she
has
a
plan
that
will
match
them
all
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
i
begged
her
not
to
go
but
oh
sir
crazy
and
i
am
no
better
my
poor
child
said
père
jerome
what
you
seem
to
want
is
not
absolution
but
relief
from
persecution
oh
father
i
have
committed
mortal
sin
i
am
guilty
of
pride
and
anger
nevertheless
said
the
priest
starting
toward
his
front
gate
we
will
put
off
your
confession
let
it
go
until
morning
you
will
find
me
in
my
box
just
before
mass
i
will
hear
you
then
my
child
i
know
that
in
your
heart
now
you
begrudge
the
time
it
would
take
and
that
is
right
there
are
moments
when
we
are
not
in
place
even
on
penitential
knees
it
is
so
with
you
now
we
must
find
your
mother
go
you
at
once
to
your
house
if
she
is
there

her
as
best
you
can
and
her
in
if
until
i
come
if
she
is
not
there

me
to
find
her

of
you
at
least

be
where
i
can

word
to
you
promptly

and
uphold
you
i
hope
you
may
find
her
at
home
tell
her
for
me
not
to
fear
he
lifted
the
that
she
and
her

in

père
jerome
pausing
on
a
in
the
last
hour
of
sunlight
had
wiped
his
brow
and
taken
his
cane
down
from
under
his
arm
to
start
again
when
somebody
coming
noiselessly
from
he
knew
not
where
asked
so
suddenly
as
to
startle
him

how

here
it
was
by
the
bonnet
and
dress
disordered
though
they
were
rather
than
by
the
haggard
face
which
looked
distractedly
around
that
he
recognized
the
woman
to
whom
he
replied
in
her
own
it
is
the
rue

where

she
almost

he
could
not
withstand
her
look
of
entreaty
come
he
said
and
they
went
jean
thompson
and
doctor
varrillat
lived
opposite
each
other
on
the
bayou
road
a
little
way
beyond
the
town
limits
as
then
prescribed
each
had
his
large
house
among
the
magnolias
his
huge
overshadowing
either
corner
of
the
darkly
shaded
garden
his
broad
brick
walk
leading
down
to
the
tall
gate
his
square
of
bright
red
pavement
on
the
sidewalk
and
his
railed
platform
spanning
the
with
a
pair
of
green
benches
one
on
each
edge
facing
each
other
crosswise
of
the
gutter
there
any
sunset
hour
you
were
sure
to
find
the
householder
sitting
beside
his
matron
two
or
three
slave
nurses
in
white
turbans
standing
at
hand
and
an
excited
throng
of
fair
children
nearly
all
of
a
size
sometimes
at
a
beckon
or
call
the
parents
on
one
side
of
the
way
would
join
those
on
the
other
and
the
children
and
nurses
of
both
families
would
be
given
the
liberty
of
the
opposite
platform
and
an
fund
generally
the
parents
chose
the
thompson
platform
its
outlook
being
more
toward
the
sunset
such
happened
to
be
the
arrangement
this
afternoon
the
two
husbands
sat
on
one
bench
and
their
wives
on
the
other
both
pairs
very
quiet
waiting
respectfully
for
the
day
to
die
and
exchanging
only
occasional
comments
on
matters
of
light
moment
as
they
passed
through
the
memory
during
one
term
of
silence
madame
varrillat
a
pale
but
lady
touched
madame
thompson
a
person
of
two
and
a
half
times
her
weight
on
her
extensive
and
snowy
bare
elbow
directing
her
attention
obliquely
up
and
across
the
road
about
a
hundred
yards
distant
in
the
direction
of
the
river
was
a
long
pleasantly
shaded
green
strip
of
turf
destined
in
time
for
a
sidewalk
it
had
a
deep
ditch
on
the
nearer
side
and
a
fence
of
rough
cypress
palisades
on
the
farther
and
these
were
overhung
on
the
one
hand
by
a
row
of
inside
the
enclosure
and
on
the
other
by
a
line
of
slanting
along
the
outer
edge
of
the
ditch
down
this
cool
avenue
two
figures
were
approaching
side
by
side
they
had
first
attracted
madame
varrillat
notice
by
the
bright
play
of
sunbeams
which
as
they
walked
fell
upon
them
in
soft
golden
flashes
through
the
chinks
between
the
palisades
madame
thompson
elevated
a
pair
of
glasses
which
were
no
detraction
from
her
very
good
looks
and
remarked
with
the
serenity
of
a
reconnoitring
general
jerome
et
cette
all
eyes
were
bent
toward
them
she
walks
like
a
man
said
madame
varrillat
in
the
language
with
which
the
conversation
had
opened
no
said
the
physician
like
a
woman
in
a
state
of
high
nervous
excitement
jean
thompson
kept
his
eyes
on
the
woman
and
said
she
must
not
forget
to
walk
like
a
woman
in
the
state
of
louisiana
as
near
as
the
pun
can
be
translated
the
company
laughed
jean
thompson
looked
at
his
wife
whose
applause
he
prized
and
she
answered
by
an
asseverative
toss
of
the
head
leaning
back
and
contriving
with
some
effort
to
get
her
arms
folded
her
laugh
was
musical
and
low
but
enough
to
make
the
folded
arms
shake
gently
up
and
down
père
jerome
is
talking
to
her
said
one
the
priest
was
at
that
moment
endeavoring
in
the
interest
of
peace
to
say
a
good
word
for
the
four
people
who
sat
watching
his
approach
it
was
in
the
old
strain
blame
them
one
part
madame
delphine
and
their
fathers
mothers
brothers
and
the
other
but
to
every
thing
she
had
the
one
amiable
answer
which
père
jerome
ignored
i
am
going
to
arrange
it
to
satisfy
everybody
all
together
à
they
are
coming
here
said
madame
varrillat
half
articulately
well
of
course
murmured
another
and
the
four
rose
up
smiling
courteously
the
doctor
and
attorney
advancing
and
shaking
hands
with
the
priest
no
père
jerome
thanked
them
he
could
not
sit
down
this
i
believe
you
know
jean
is
madame
delphine
the
quadroone
courtesied
a
friend
of
mine
he
added
smiling
kindly
upon
her
and
turning
with
something
imperative
in
his
eye
to
the
group
she
says
she
has
an
important
private
matter
to
communicate
to
me
asked
jean
thompson
to
all
of
you
so
i
will
he
responded
nothing
to
the
expressions
of
regret
but
turned
to
madame
delphine
she
murmured
something
ah
yes
certainly
he
addressed
the
company
she
wishes
me
to
speak
for
her
veracity
it
is
unimpeachable
well
he
shook
hands
and
departed
the
four
resumed
their
seats
and
turned
their
eyes
upon
the
standing
figure
have
you
something
to
say
to
us
asked
jean
thompson
frowning
at
her
bonnet
oui
replied
the
woman
shrinking
to
one
side
and
laying
hold
of
one
of
the
benches
oulé

she
attempted
to
fan
herself
her
face
turned
away
from
the
attorney
and
her
eyes
rested
on
the
ground
take
a
seat
said
doctor
varrillat
with
some
suddenness
starting
from
his
place
and
gently
guiding
her
sinking
form
into
the
corner
of
the
bench
the
ladies
rose
up
somebody
had
to
stand
the
two
races
could
not
both
sit
down
at
once
at
least
not
in
that
public
manner

said
the
physician
to
his
wife
she
handed
the
vial
madame
delphine
stood
up
again
we
will
all
go
inside
said
madame
thompson
and
they
passed
through
the
gate
and
up
the
walk
mounted
the
steps
and
entered
the
deep
cool
madame
thompson
herself
bade
the
quadroone
be
seated
well
said
jean
thompson
as
the
rest
took
chairs
it
funny
said
madame
delphine
with
a
piteous
effort
to
smile
that
nobody
thought
of
it
it
is
so
plain
you
have
only
to
look
and
see
i
mean
about
olive
she
loosed
a
button
in
the
front
of
her
dress
and
passed
her
hand
into
her
bosom
and
yet
olive
herself
never
thought
of
it
she
does
not
know
a
word
the
hand
came
out
holding
a
miniature
madame
varrillat
passed
it
to
jean
thompson
so
said
madame
delphine
that
is
her
father
it
went
from
one
to
another
exciting
admiration
and
murmured
praise
she
is
the
image
of
him
said
madame
thompson
in
an
austere
undertone
returning
it
to
her
husband
doctor
varrillat
was
watching
madame
delphine
she
was
very
pale
she
had
passed
a
trembling
hand
into
a
pocket
of
her
skirt
and
now
drew
out
another
picture
in
a
case
the
counterpart
of
the
first
he
reached
out
for
it
and
she
handed
it
to
him
he
looked
at
it
a
moment
when
his
eyes
suddenly
lighted
up
and
he
passed
it
to
the
attorney
madame
delphine
utterance
failed
là
ouala
sa
that
is
her
mother
the
three
others
instantly
gathered
around
jean
thompson
chair
they
were
much
impressed
it
is
true
beyond
a
doubt
muttered
madame
thompson
madame
varrillat
looked
at
her
with
astonishment
the
proof
is
right
there
in
the
faces
said
madame
thompson
yes
yes
said
madame
delphine
excitedly
the
proof
is
there
you
do
not
want
any
better
i
am
willing
to
swear
to
it
but
you
want
no
better
proof
that
is
all
anybody
could
want
my
god
you
can
not
help
but
see
it
her
manner
was
wild
jean
thompson
looked
at
her
sternly
nevertheless
you
say
you
are
willing
to
take
your
solemn
oath
to
this
certainly
you
will
have
to
do
it
certainly
miché
thompson
i
shall
you
will
make
out
the
paper
and
i
will
swear
before
god
that
it
is
true
only
turning
to
the
ladies
do
not
tell
olive
she
will
never
believe
it
it
will
break
her
heart
it
a
servant
came
and
spoke
privately
to
madame
thompson
who
rose
quickly
and
went
to
the
hall
madame
delphine
continued
rising
unconsciously
you
see
i
have
had
her
with
me
from
a
baby
she
knows
no
better
he
brought
her
to
me
only
two
months
old
her
mother
had
died
in
the
ship
coming
out
here
he
did
not
come
straight
from
home
here
his
people
never
knew
he
was
married
the
speaker
looked
around
suddenly
with
a
startled
glance
there
was
a
noise
of
excited
speaking
in
the
hall
it
is
not
true
madame
thompson
cried
a
girl
voice
madame
delphine
look
became
one
of
wildest
distress
and
alarm
and
she
opened
her
lips
in
a
vain
attempt
to
utter
some
request
when
olive
appeared
a
moment
in
the
door
and
then
flew
into
her
arms
my
mother
my
mother
my
mother
madame
thompson
with
tears
in
her
eyes
tenderly
drew
them
apart
and
let
madame
delphine
down
into
her
chair
while
olive
threw
herself
upon
her
knees
continuing
to
cry
oh
my
mother
say
you
are
my
mother
madame
delphine
looked
an
instant
into
the
upturned
face
and
then
turned
her
own
away
with
a
long
low
cry
of
pain
looked
again
and
laying
both
hands
upon
the
suppliant
head
said
chère
piti
à
moin
to
pa
ma
oh
my
darling
little
one
you
are
not
my
daughter
her
eyes
closed
and
her
head
sank
back
the
two
gentlemen
sprang
to
her
assistance
and
laid
her
upon
a
sofa
unconscious
when
they
brought
her
to
herself
olive
was
kneeling
at
her
head
silently
weeping
chère
said
the
girl
softly
kissing
her
lips
courri
i
will
go
home
said
the
mother
drearily
you
will
go
home
with
me
said
madame
varrillat
with
great
kindness
of
manner
just
across
the
street
here
i
will
take
care
of
you
till
you
feel
better
and
olive
will
stay
here
with
madame
thompson
you
will
be
only
the
width
of
the
street
apart
but
madame
delphine
would
go
nowhere
but
to
her
home
olive
she
would
not
allow
to
go
with
her
then
they
wanted
to
send
a
servant
or
two
to
sleep
in
the
house
with
her
for
aid
and
protection
but
all
she
would
accept
was
the
transient
service
of
a
messenger
to
invite
two
of
her
kinspeople
man
and
wife
to
come
and
make
their
dwelling
with
her
in
course
of
time
these
two
a
poor
timid
helpless
pair
fell
heir
to
the
premises
their
children
had
it
after
them
but
whether
in
those
hands
or
these
the
house
had
its
habits
and
continued
in
them
and
to
this
day
the
neighbors
as
has
already
been
said
rightly
explain
its
uninhabited
look
by
the
statement
that
the

eleison
the
second
saturday
afternoon
following
was
hot
and
calm
the
lamp
burning
before
the
tabernacle
in
père
jerome
little
church
might
have
hung
with
as
motionless
a
flame
in
the
window
behind
the
lilies
of
joseph
wand
shining
in
one
of
the
half
opened
panes
were
not
more
completely
at
rest
than
the
leaves
on
tree
and
vine
without
suspended
in
the
slumbering
air
almost
as
still
down
under
the
with
a
single
band
of
light
falling
athwart
his
box
from
a
small
door
which
stood
ajar
sat
the
little
priest
behind
the
lattice
of
the
confessional
silently
wiping
away
the
sweat
that
beaded
on
his
brow
and
rolled
down
his
face
at
distant
intervals
the
shadow
of
some
one
entering
softly
through
the
door
would
obscure
for
a
moment
the
band
of
light
and
an
aged
crone
or
a
little
boy
or
some
gentle
presence
that
the
listening
confessor
had
known
only
by
the
voice
for
many
years
would
kneel
a
few
moments
beside
his
waiting
ear
in
prayer
for
blessing
and
in
review
of
those
slips
and
errors
which
prove
us
all
akin
the
day
had
been
long
and
fatiguing
first
early
mass
a
hasty
meal
then
a
business
call
upon
the
archbishop
in
the
interest
of
some
projected
charity
then
back
to
his
cottage
and
so
to
the
of
vignevielle
in
the
rue
toulouse
there
all
was
open
bright
and
its
master
virtually
though
not
actually
present
the
search
was
over
and
the
seekers
gone
personally
wiser
than
they
would
tell
and
officially
reporting
that
to
the
best
of
their
knowledge
and
belief
based
on
evidence
and
especially
on
the
assurances
of
an
unexceptionable
to
wit
monsieur
vignevielle
banker
capitaine
lemaitre
was
dead
and
buried
at
noon
there
had
been
a
wedding
in
the
little
church
its
scenes
lingered
before
père
jerome
vision
now
the
kneeling
pair
the
bridegroom
rich
in
all
the
excellences
of
man
strength
and
kindness
slumbering
interlocked
in
every
part
and
feature
the
bride
a
saintly
weariness
on
her
pale
face
her
awesome
eyes
lifted
in
adoration
upon
the
image
of
the
saviour
the
small
knots
of
friends
behind
madame
thompson
large
fair
jean
thompson
with
the
affidavit
of
madame
delphine
showing
through
his
tightly
buttoned
coat
the
physician
and
his
wife
sharing
one
expression
of
amiable
consent
and
last
yet
first
one
small
shrinking
female
figure
here
at
one
side
in
faded
robes
and
dingy
bonnet
she
sat
as
motionless
as
stone
yet
wore
a
look
of
apprehension
and
in
the
small
restless
black
eyes
which
peered
out
from
the
pinched
and
wasted
face
betrayed
the
peacelessness
of
a
harrowed
mind
and
neither
the
recollection
of
bride
nor
of
groom
nor
of
potential
friends
behind
nor
the
occupation
of
the
present
hour
could
shut
out
from
the
tired
priest
the
image
of
that
woman
or
the
sound
of
his
own
low
words
of
invitation
to
her
given
as
the
company
left
the
church
come
to
confession
this
afternoon
by
and
by
a
long
time
passed
without
the
approach
of
any
step
or
any
glancing
of
light
or
shadow
save
for
the
occasional
progress
from
station
to
station
of
some
one
over
on
the
right
who
was
noiselessly
going
the
way
of
the
cross
yet
père
jerome
tarried
she
will
surely
come
he
said
to
himself
she
promised
she
would
come
a
moment
later
his
sense
quickened
by
the
prolonged
silence
caught
a
subtle
evidence
or
two
of
approach
and
the
next
moment
a
penitent
knelt
noiselessly
at
the
window
of
his
box
and
the
whisper
came
tremblingly
in
the
voice
he
had
waited
to
hear
mo
père
que
mo
bless
me
father
for
i
have
sinned
he
gave
his
blessing
ainsi
amen
murmured
the
penitent
and
then
in
the
soft
accents
of
the
creole
continued
confess
to
almighty
god
to
the
blessed
mary
ever
virgin
to
blessed
michael
the
archangel
to
blessed
john
the
baptist
to
the
holy
apostles
peter
and
paul
and
to
all
the
saints
that
i
have
sinned
exceedingly
in
thought
word
and
deed
my
fault
through
my
fault
through
my
most
grievous
i
confessed
on
saturday
three
weeks
ago
and
received
absolution
and
i
have
performed
the
penance
enjoined
since
then
there
she
stopped
there
was
a
soft
stir
as
if
she
sank
slowly
down
and
another
as
if
she
rose
up
again
and
in
a
moment
she
said
olive
my
child
the
picture
i
showed
to
jean
thompson
is
the
of
my
daughter
father
dead
before
my
child
was
born
she
is
the
image
of
her
and
of
him
but
o
god
thou
knowest
oh
olive
my
own
daughter
she
ceased
and
was
still
père
jerome
waited
but
no
sound
came
he
looked
through
the
window
she
was
kneeling
with
her
forehead
resting
on
her
arms
motionless
he
repeated
the
words
of
absolution
still
she
did
not
stir
my
daughter
he
said
go
to
thy
home
in
peace
but
she
did
not
move
he
rose
hastily
stepped
from
the
box
raised
her
in
his
arms
and
called
her
by
name
madame
delphine
her
head
fell
back
in
his
elbow
for
an
instant
there
was
life
in
the
eyes
it
glimmered
it
vanished
and
tears
gushed
from
his
own
and
fell
upon
the
gentle
face
of
the
dead
as
he
looked
up
to
heaven
and
cried
lord
lay
not
this
sin
to
her
charge
café
des
exilés
that
which
in
i
think
he
said
was
a
reality
in
the
rue
burgundy
i
think
he
said
burgundy
is
now
but
a
reminiscence
yet
so
vividly
was
its
story
told
me
that
at
this
moment
the
old
café
des
exilés
appears
before
my
eye
floating
in
the
clouds
of
revery
and
i
doubt
not
i
see
it
just
as
it
was
in
the
old
times
an
antiquated
creole
cottage
sitting
right
down
on
the
banquette
as
do
the
choctaw
squaws
who
sell
bay
and
sassafras
and
with
a
high
close
shutting
out
of
view
the
diminutive
garden
on
the
southern
side
an
ancient
willow
droops
over
the
roof
of
round
tiles
and
partly
hides
the
discolored
stucco
which
keeps
dropping
off
into
the
garden
as
though
the
old
café
was
stripping
for
the
plunge
into
oblivion
disrobing
for
its
execution
i
see
well
up
in
the
angle
of
the
broad
side
gable
shaded
by
its
rude
awning
of
clapboards
as
the
eyes
of
an
old
dame
are
shaded
by
her
wrinkled
hand
the
window
of
pauline
oh
for
the
image
of
the
maiden
were
it
but
for
one
moment
leaning
out
of
the
casement
to
hang
her
and
looking
down
into
the
garden
where
above
the
barrier
of
old
boards
i
see
the
top
of
the
the
pale
green
clump
of
bananas
the
tall
palmetto
with
its
jagged
crown
pauline
own
two
holding
up
their
bands
toward
the
window
heavy
with
the
promises
of
autumn
the
broad
crimson
mass
of
the
oleander
and
the
crisp
boughs
of
the
pomegranate
loaded
with
freckled
apples
and
with
here
and
there
a
lingering
scarlet
blossom
the
café
des
exilés
to
use
a
figure
flowered
bore
fruit
and
dropped
it
long
ago
or
rather
time
and
fate
like
some
uncursed
adam
and
eve
came
side
by
side
and
cut
away
its
clusters
as
we
sever
the
golden
burden
of
the
banana
from
its
stem
then
like
a
banana
which
has
borne
its
fruit
it
was
razed
to
the
ground
and
made
way
for
a
newer
brighter
growth
i
believe
it
would
set
every
tooth
on
edge
should
i
go
by
there
now
now
that
i
have
heard
the
story
and
see
the
old
site
covered
by
the
pleasanter
far
to
close
my
eyes
and
call
to
view
the
unpretentious
portals
of
the
old
café
with
her
children
for
such
those
exiles
seem
to
me
dragging
their
out
and
sitting
in
their
wonted
group
under
the
long
eaves
which
shaded
the
banquette
of
the
rue
burgundy
it
was
in
that
the
café
des
exilés
was
as
one
might
say
in
full
blossom
old
father
of
pauline
and
host
of
the
café
himself
a
refugee
from
san
domingo
was
the
cause
at
least
the
human
cause
of
its
opening
as
its
glazed
doors
expanded
emitting
a
little
puff
of
his
own
cigarette
smoke
it
was
like
the
bursting
of
catalpa
blossoms
and
the
exiles
came
like
bees
pushing
into
the
tiny
room
to
sip
its
rich
variety
of
tropical
sirups
its
lemonades
its
orangeades
its
orgeats
its
and
its
outlandish
wines
while
they
talked
of
dear
home
that
is
to
say
of
barbadoes
of
martinique
of
san
domingo
and
of
cuba
there
were
pedro
and
benigno
and
fernandez
and
francisco
and
benito
benito
was
a
tall
swarthy
man
with
immense
gray
moustachios
and
hair
as
harsh
as
tropical
grass
and
gray
as
ashes
when
he
could
spare
his
cigarette
from
his
lips
he
would
tell
you
in
a
cavernous
voice
and
with
a
wrinkled
smile
that
he
was
there
was
martinez
of
san
domingo
yellow
as
a
canary
always
sitting
with
one
leg
curled
under
him
and
holding
the
back
of
his
head
in
his
knitted
fingers
against
the
back
of
his
father
mother
brother
sisters
all
had
been
massacred
in
the
struggle
of
and
he
alone
was
left
to
tell
the
tale
and
told
it
often
with
that
strange
infantile
insensibility
to
the
solemnity
of
his
bereavement
so
peculiar
to
latin
people
but
besides
these
and
many
who
need
no
mention
there
were
two
in
particular
around
whom
all
the
story
of
the
café
des
exilés
of
old
and
of
pauline
turns
as
on
a
double
centre
first
manuel
mazaro
whose
small
restless
eyes
were
as
black
and
bright
as
those
of
a
mouse
whose
light
talk
became
his
dark
girlish
face
and
whose
redundant
locks
curled
so
prettily
and
so
wonderfully
black
under
the
fine
white
brim
of
his
jaunty
panama
he
had
the
hands
of
a
woman
save
that
the
nails
were
stained
with
the
smoke
of
cigarettes
he
could
play
the
guitar
delightfully
and
wore
his
knife
down
behind
his
the
second
was
major
galahad
shaughnessy
i
imagine
i
can
see
him
in
his
white
duck
roundabout
with
his
sabreless
belt
peeping
out
beneath
all
his
boyishness
in
his
eyes
leaning
lightly
against
the
of
the
café
des
exilés
as
a
child
leans
against
his
mother
running
his
fingers
over
a
basketful
of
fragrant
limes
and
watching
his
chance
to
strike
some
solemn
creole
under
the
fifth
rib
with
a
good
old
irish
joke
old
drew
him
close
to
his
bosom
the
spanish
creoles
were
as
the
old
man
termed
it
both
cold
and
hot
but
never
warm
major
shaughnessy
was
warm
and
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
to
find
those
two
apart
from
the
others
talking
in
an
undertone
and
playing
at
confidantes
like
two
schoolgirls
the
kind
old
man
was
at
this
time
drifting
close
up
to
his
sixtieth
year
there
was
much
he
could
tell
of
san
domingo
whither
he
had
been
carried
from
martinique
in
his
childhood
whence
he
had
become
a
refugee
to
cuba
and
thence
to
new
orleans
in
the
flight
of
it
fell
one
day
to
manuel
mazaro
lot
to
discover
by
sauntering
within
earshot
that
to
galahad
shaughnessy
only
of
all
the
children
of
the
café
des
exilés
the
good
host
spoke
long
and
confidentially
concerning
his
daughter
the
words
half
heard
and
magnified
like
objects
seem
in
a
fog
meaning
manuel
mazaro
knew
not
what
but
made
portentous
by
his
suspicious
nature
were
but
the
old
man
recital
of
the
grinding
he
had
got
between
the
millstones
of
his
poverty
and
his
pride
in
trying
so
long
to
sustain
for
little
pauline
sake
that
attitude
before
society
which
earns
respect
from
a
world
it
was
while
he
was
telling
this
that
manuel
mazaro
drew
near
the
old
man
paused
in
an
embarrassed
way
the
major
sitting
sidewise
in
his
chair
lifted
his
cheek
from
its
on
his
elbow
and
mazaro
after
standing
an
awkward
moment
turned
away
with
such
an
inward
feeling
as
one
may
guess
would
arise
in
a
heart
full
of
cuban
blood
not
unmixed
with
indian
as
he
moved
off
resumed
that
in
a
last
extremity
he
had
opened
partly
from
dire
want
partly
for
very
love
to
homeless
souls
the
café
des
exilés
he
had
hoped
that
as
strong
drink
and
high
words
were
to
be
alike
unknown
to
it
it
might
not
prejudice
sensible
people
but
it
had
he
had
no
doubt
they
said
among
themselves
she
is
an
excellent
and
beautiful
girl
and
deserving
all
respect
and
respect
they
accorded
but
their
they
never
came
to
pay
a
café
is
a
café
said
the
old
gentleman
it
is
nod
possib
to
ezcape
him
aldough
de
café
des
exilés
is
differen
from
de
rez
it
different
from
the
café
des
réfugiés
suggested
the
irishman
differen
as
possib
replied
he
looked
about
upon
the
walls
the
shelves
were
luscious
with
ranks
of
cooling
sirups
which
he
alone
knew
how
to
make
the
expression
of
his
face
changed
from
sadness
to
a
gentle
pride
which
spoke
without
words
saying
and
let
our
story
pause
a
moment
to
hear
it
say
if
any
poor
exile
from
any
island
where
guavas
or
mangoes
or
plantains
grow
wants
a
draught
which
will
make
him
see
his
home
among
the
behold
the
café
des
exilés
ready
to
take
the
poor
child
up
and
give
him
the
breast
and
if
gold
or
silver
he
has
them
not
why
heaven
and
santa
maria
and
saint
christopher
bless
him
it
makes
no
difference
here
is
a
here
a
cigarette
and
here
a
light
from
the
host
own
tinder
he
will
pay
when
he
can
as
this
easily
pardoned
pride
said
so
it
often
occurred
and
if
the
newly
come
exile
said
his
father
was
a
spaniard
come
old
would
cry
another
glass
it
is
an
innocent
drink
my
mother
was
a
castilian
but
if
the
exile
said
his
mother
was
a
frenchwoman
the
glasses
would
be
forthcoming
all
the
same
for
my
father
the
old
man
would
say
was
a
frenchman
of
martinique
with
blood
as
pure
as
that
wine
and
a
heart
as
sweet
as
this
honey
come
a
glass
of
orgeat
and
he
would
bring
it
himself
in
a
quart
tumbler
now
there
are
jealousies
and
jealousies
there
are
people
who
rise
up
quickly
and
kill
and
there
are
others
who
turn
their
hot
thoughts
over
silently
in
their
minds
as
a
brooding
bird
turns
her
eggs
in
the
nest
thus
did
manuel
mazaro
and
took
it
ill
that
galahad
should
see
a
vision
in
the
temple
while
he
and
all
the
brethren
tarried
without
pauline
had
been
to
the
café
des
exilés
in
some
degree
what
the
image
of
the
virgin
was
to
their
churches
at
home
and
for
her
father
to
whisper
her
name
to
one
and
not
to
another
was
it
seemed
to
mazaro
as
if
the
old
man
were
he
a
sacristan
should
say
to
some
single
worshiper
here
you
may
have
this
madonna
i
make
it
a
present
to
you
or
if
such
was
not
the
handsome
young
cuban
feeling
such
at
least
was
the
disguise
his
jealousy
put
on
if
pauline
was
to
be
handed
down
from
her
niche
why
then
farewell
café
des
exilés
she
was
its
preserving
influence
she
made
the
place
holy
she
was
the
burning
candles
on
the
altar
surely
the
reader
will
pardon
the
pen
that
lingers
in
the
mention
of
her
and
yet
i
know
not
how
to
describe
the
forbearing
unspoken
tenderness
with
which
all
these
exiles
regarded
the
maiden
in
the
balmy
afternoons
as
i
have
said
they
gathered
about
their
mother
knee
that
is
to
say
upon
the
banquette
outside
the
door
there
lolling
back
in
their
they
would
pass
the
evening
hours
with
tales
of
home
and
the
moon
would
come
out
and
glide
among
the
clouds
like
a
silver
barge
among
islands
wrapped
in
mist
and
they
loved
the
silently
gliding
orb
with
a
sort
of
worship
because
from
her
soaring
height
she
looked
down
at
the
same
moment
upon
them
and
upon
their
homes
in
the
far
antilles
it
was
somewhat
thus
that
they
looked
upon
pauline
as
she
seemed
to
them
held
up
half
way
to
heaven
they
knew
not
how
ah
those
who
have
been
pilgrims
who
have
wandered
out
beyond
harbor
and
light
whom
fate
hath
led
in
lonely
paths
strewn
with
thorns
and
briers
not
of
their
own
sowing
who
homeless
in
a
land
of
homes
see
windows
gleaming
and
doors
ajar
but
not
for
them
it
is
they
who
well
understand
what
the
worship
is
that
cries
to
any
daughter
of
our
dear
mother
eve
whose
footsteps
chance
may
draw
across
the
path
the
silent
beseeching
cry
stay
a
little
instant
that
i
may
look
upon
you
oh
woman
beautifier
of
the
earth
stay
till
i
recall
the
face
of
my
sister
stay
yet
a
moment
while
i
look
from
afar
with
hands
upon
the
softness
of
thy
cheek
upon
the
folded
coils
of
thy
shining
hair
and
my
spirit
shall
fall
down
and
say
those
prayers
which
i
may
never
again
god
knoweth
say
at
home
she
was
seldom
seen
but
sometimes
when
the
lounging
exiles
would
be
sitting
in
their
afternoon
circle
under
the
eaves
and
some
old
man
would
tell
his
tale
of
fire
and
blood
and
capture
and
escape
and
the
heads
would
lean
forward
from
the
and
a
great
stillness
would
follow
the
ending
of
the
story
old
would
all
at
once
speak
up
and
say
laying
his
hands
upon
the
narrator
knee
comrade
your
throat
is
dry
here
are
fresh
limes
let
my
dear
child
herself
come
and
mix
you
a
lemonade
then
the
neighbors
over
the
way
sitting
about
their
doors
would
by
and
by
softly
say
see
see
there
is
pauline
and
all
the
exiles
would
rise
from
their
take
off
their
hats
and
stand
as
men
stand
in
church
while
pauline
came
out
like
the
moon
from
a
cloud
descended
the
three
steps
of
the
café
door
and
stood
with
waiter
and
glass
a
new
rebecca
with
her
pitcher
before
the
swarthy
wanderer
what
tales
that
would
have
been
nay
had
they
not
been
palpable
inventions
the
pretty
womanish
mazaro
from
time
to
time
poured
forth
in
the
ever
ungratified
hope
that
the
goddess
might
come
down
with
a
draught
of
nectar
for
him
it
profiteth
not
to
recount
but
i
should
fail
to
show
a
family
feature
of
the
café
des
exilés
did
i
omit
to
say
that
these
adventures
were
heard
with
every
mark
of
respect
and
credence
while
on
the
other
hand
they
were
never
attempted
in
the
presence
of
the
irishman
he
would
have
moved
an
eyebrow
or
made
some
barely
audible
sound
or
dropped
some
seemingly
innocent
word
and
the
whole
company
spite
of
themselves
would
have
smiled
wherefore
it
may
be
doubted
whether
at
any
time
the
young
cuban
had
that
playful
affection
for
his
celtic
comrade
which
a
habit
of
giving
little
velvet
taps
to
galahad
cheek
made
a
show
of
such
was
the
café
des
exilés
such
its
inmates
such
its
guests
when
certain
apparently
trivial
events
began
to
fall
around
it
as
germs
of
blight
fall
upon
corn
and
to
bring
about
that
end
which
cometh
to
all
things
the
little
seed
of
jealousy
dropped
into
the
heart
of
manuel
mazaro
we
have
already
taken
into
account
galahad
shaughnessy
began
to
be
specially
active
in
organizing
a
society
of
spanish
americans
the
design
of
which
as
set
forth
in
its
manuscript
constitution
was
to
provide
proper
funeral
honors
to
such
of
their
membership
as
might
be
overtaken
by
death
and
whenever
it
was
practicable
to
send
their
ashes
to
their
native
land
next
to
galahad
in
this
movement
was
an
elegant
old
mexican
physician
his
name
escapes
me
whom
the
café
des
exilés
sometimes
took
upon
her
lap
that
is
to
say
but
whose
favorite
resort
was
the
old
café
des
réfugiés
in
the
rue
royale
royal
street
as
it
was
beginning
to
be
called
manuel
mazaro
was
made
secretary
it
was
for
some
reason
thought
judicious
for
the
society
to
hold
its
meetings
in
various
places
now
here
now
there
but
the
most
frequent
rendezvous
was
the
café
des
exilés
it
was
quiet
those
spanish
creoles
however
they
may
afterward
cackle
like
to
lay
their
plans
noiselessly
like
a
hen
in
a
barn
there
was
a
very
general
confidence
in
this
old
institution
a
kind
of
inward
assurance
that
mother
would
tell
though
after
all
what
great
secrets
could
there
be
connected
with
a
mere
burial
society
before
the
hour
of
meeting
the
café
des
exilés
always
sent
away
her
children
and
closed
her
door
presently
they
would
commence
returning
one
by
one
as
a
flock
of
wild
fowl
will
do
that
has
been
startled
up
from
its
accustomed
haunt
frequenters
of
the
café
des
réfugiés
also
would
appear
a
small
gate
in
the
close
let
them
into
a
room
behind
the
café
proper
and
by
and
by
the
apartment
would
be
full
of
men
conversing
in
the
low
courteous
tone
common
to
their
race
the
shutters
of
doors
and
windows
were
closed
and
the
chinks
stopped
with
cotton
some
people
are
so
jealous
of
observation
on
a
certain
night
after
one
of
these
meetings
had
dispersed
in
its
peculiar
way
the
members
retiring
two
by
two
at
intervals
manuel
mazaro
and
were
left
alone
sitting
close
together
in
the
dimly
lighted
room
the
former
speaking
the
other
with
no
pleasant
countenance
attending
it
seemed
to
the
young
cuban
a
proper
precaution
he
was
made
of
precautions
to
speak

mazaro
smiled
and
nodded
his
host
opened
the
door
into
the
garden
and
as
the
young
man
stepped
out
noticed
even
then
how
handsome
was
his
face
and
figure
and
how
the
odor
of
the
night
jasmine
was
filling
the
air
with
an
almost
insupportable
sweetness
the
cuban
paused
a
moment
as
if
to
speak
but
checked
himself
lifted
his
girlish
face
and
looked
up
to
where
the
daggers
of
the
were
crossed
upon
the
face
of
the
moon
dropped
his
glance
touched
his
panama
and
silently
followed
by
the
old
man
drew
open
the
little
looked
cautiously
out
said
and
stepped
into
the
street
as
returned
to
the
door
through
which
he
had
come
he
uttered
an
ejaculation
of
astonishment
pauline
stood
before
him
she
spoke
hurriedly
in
french
papa
papa
it
is
not
true
no
my
child
he
responded
i
am
sure
it
is
not
true
i
am
sure
it
is
all
false
but
why
do
i
find
you
out
of
bed
so
late
little
bird
the
night
is
nearly
gone
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
cheek
ah
papa
i
can
not
deceive
you
i
thought
manuel
would
tell
you
something
of
this
kind
and
i
listened
the
father
face
immediately
betrayed
a
new
and
deeper
distress
pauline
my
child
he
said
with
tremulous
voice
if
manuel
story
is
all
false
in
the
name
of
heaven
how
could
you
think
he
was
going
to
tell
it
he
unconsciously
clasped
his
hands
the
good
child
had
one
trait
which
she
could
not
have
inherited
from
her
father
she
was
and
discerning
yet
now
she
stood
confounded
speak
my
child
cried
the
alarmed
old
man
speak
let
me
live
and
not
die
oh
papa
she
cried
i
do
not
know
the
old
man
groaned
papa
papa
she
cried
again
i
felt
it
i
know
not
how
something
told
me
alas
exclaimed
the
old
man
if
it
was
your
conscience
no
no
no
papa
cried
pauline
but
i
was
afraid
of
manuel
mazaro
and
i
think
he
hates
him
and
i
think
he
will
hurt
him
in
any
way
he
can
and
i
he
will
even
try
to
kill
him
oh
my
god
she
struck
her
hands
together
above
her
head
and
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
her
father
looked
upon
her
with
such
sad
sternness
as
his
tender
nature
was
capable
of
he
laid
hold
of
one
of
her
arms
to
draw
a
hand
from
the
face
whither
both
hands
had
gone
you
know
something
else
he
said
you
know
that
the
major
loves
you
or
you
think
so
is
it
not
true
she
dropped
both
hands
and
lifting
her
streaming
eyes
that
had
nothing
to
hide
straight
to
his
suddenly
said
i
would
give
worlds
to
think
so
and
sunk
upon
the
floor
he
was
melted
and
convinced
in
one
instant
oh
my
child
my
child
he
cried
trying
to
lift
her
oh
my
poor
little
pauline
your
papa
is
not
angry
rise
my
little
one
so
kiss
me
heaven
bless
thee
pauline
treasure
what
shall
i
do
with
thee
where
shall
i
hide
thee
you
have
my
counsel
already
papa
yes
my
child
and
you
were
right
the
café
des
exilés
never
should
have
been
opened
it
is
no
place
for
you
no
place
at
all
let
us
leave
it
said
pauline
ah
pauline
i
would
close
it
if
i
could
but
now
it
is
too
late
i
can
not
why
asked
pauline
pleadingly
she
had
cast
an
arm
about
his
neck
her
tears
sparkled
with
a
smile
my
daughter
i
can
not
tell
you
you
must
go
now
to
bed
or
god
keep
you
well
then
papa
she
said
have
no
fear
you
need
not
hide
me
i
have
my
and
my
altar
and
my
garden
and
my
window
my
garden
is
my
fenced
city
and
my
window
my
do
you
see
ah
pauline
responded
the
father
but
i
have
been
letting
the
enemy
in
and
out
at
pleasure
she
answered
and
kissed
him
three
times
on
either
cheek
the
blessed
virgin
will
take
care
of
us
never
said
those
things
not
he
the
next
evening
galahad
shaughnessy
and
manuel
mazaro
met
at
that
very
different
place
the
café
des
réfugiés
there
was
much
free
talk
going
on
about
texan
annexation
about
chances
of
war
with
mexico
about
san
domingan
affairs
about
cuba
and
many
galahad
was
in
his
usual
gay
mood
he
strode
about
among
a
mixed
company
of
louisianais
cubans
and
américains
keeping
them
in
a
great
laugh
with
his
account
of
one
of
ole
bull
concerts
and
how
he
had
there
extorted
an
invitation
from
and
mme
devoti
to
attend
one
of
their
famous
children
fancy
dress
balls
halloo
said
he
as
mazaro
approached
heer
the
etheerial
angelica
herself
heer
sissy
why
ye
in
the
maternal
arms
of
the
café
des
exilés
mazaro
smiled
amiably
and
sat
down
a
moment
after
the
irishman
stepping
away
from
his
companions
stood
before
the
young
cuban
and
asked
with
a
quiet
business
air
d
want
to
see
me
mazaro
the
cuban
nodded
and
they
went
aside
mazaro
in
a
few
quick
words
looking
at
his
pretty
foot
the
while
told
the
other
on
no
account
to
go
near
the
café
des
exilés
as
there
were
two
men
hanging
about
there
evidently
watching
for
him
and
wut
the
use
o
that
asked
galahad
i
say
wut
the
use
o
that
major
shaughnessy
habit
of
repeating
part
of
his
words
arose
from
another
of
interrupting
any
person
who
might
be
speaking
they
must
know
i
say
they
must
know
that
whenever
i
nowhurs
else
heer
what
do
they
want
mazaro
made
a
gesture
signifying
caution
and
secrecy
and
smiled
as
if
to
say
you
ought
to
know
aha
said
the
irishman
softly
why
do
they
come
here
said
mazaro
frai
to
do
een
crowth
that
so
said
the
irishman
i
say
that
so
if
i
do
feel
very
much
like
i
not
go
i
say
i
not
go
we
no
business
eh
mazaro
no
senor
a
second
evening
was
much
the
same
mazaro
repeating
his
warning
but
when
on
the
third
evening
the
irishman
again
repeated
his
willingness
to
stay
away
from
the
café
des
exilés
unless
he
should
feel
strongly
impelled
to
go
it
was
with
the
mental
reservation
that
he
did
feel
very
much
in
that
humor
and
unknown
to
mazaro
should
thither
repair
if
only
to
see
whether
some
of
those
deep
old
fellows
were
not
contriving
a
practical
joke
mazaro
said
he
i
around
the
caurnur
a
bit
i
want
ye
to
wait
heer
till
i
come
back
i
say
i
want
ye
to
wait
heer
till
i
come
back
i
be
gone
about
of
an
hour
mazaro
assented
he
saw
with
satisfaction
the
irishman
start
in
a
direction
opposite
that
in
which
lay
the
café
des
exilés
tarried
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
and
then
thinking
he
could
step
around
to
the
café
des
exilés
and
return
before
the
expiration
of
the
allotted
time
hurried
out
meanwhile
that
peaceful
habitation
sat
in
the
moonlight
with
her
children
about
her
feet
the
company
outside
the
door
was
somewhat
thinner
than
common
was
not
among
them
but
was
sitting
in
the
room
behind
the
café
the
long
table
which
the
burial
society
used
at
their
meetings
extended
across
the
apartment
and
a
lamp
had
been
placed
upon
it
sat
by
the
lamp
opposite
him
was
a
chair
which
seemed
awaiting
an
expected
occupant
beside
the
old
man
sat
pauline
they
were
talking
in
cautious
undertones
and
in
french
no
she
seemed
to
insist
we
do
not
know
that
he
refuses
to
come
we
only
know
that
manuel
says
so
the
father
shook
his
head
sadly
when
has
he
ever
staid
away
three
nights
together
before
he
asked
no
my
child
it
is
intentional
manuel
urges
him
to
come
but
he
only
sends
poor
excuses
but
said
the
girl
shading
her
face
from
the
lamp
and
speaking
with
some
suddenness
why
have
you
not
sent
word
to
him
by
some
other
person
looked
up
at
his
daughter
a
moment
and
then
smiled
at
his
own
simplicity
ah
he
said
certainly
and
that
is
what
i
will
run
away
pauline
there
is
manuel
now
ahead
of
time
a
step
was
heard
inside
the
café
the
maiden
though
she
knew
the
step
was
not
mazaro
rose
hastily
opened
the
nearest
door
and
disappeared
she
had
barely
closed
it
behind
her
when
galahad
shaughnessy
entered
the
apartment
rose
up
both
surprised
and
confused
munsher
said
the
irishman
munsher
i
know
it
against
rules
i
say
i
know
it
against
rules
to
come
in
here
but
smiling
i
want
to
have
a
private
wurd
with
ye
i
say
i
want
to
have
a
private
wurd
with
ye
in
the
closet
of
bottles
the
maiden
smiled
triumphantly
she
also
wiped
the
dew
from
her
forehead
for
the
place
was
very
close
and
warm
with
her
father
was
no
triumph
in
him
sadness
and
doubt
were
so
mingled
with
anger
that
he
dared
not
lift
his
eyes
but
gazed
at
the
knot
in
the
wood
of
the
table
which
looked
like
a
caterpillar
curled
up
mazaro
he
concluded
had
really
asked
the
major
to
come
mazaro
tol
you
he
asked
yes
answered
the
irishman
mazaro
told
me
i
was
watched
and
asked
madjor
unluckily
interrupted
the
old
man
suddenly
looking
up
and
speaking
with
subdued
fervor
for
iv
mazaro
tol
you
for
you
din
come
more
sooner
dad
is
one
charge
again
you
did
mazaro
tell
ye
why
i
did
come
asked
the
other
beginning
to
be
puzzled
at
his
host
meaning
yez
replied
bud
one
brev
zhenteman
should
not
be
afraid
of
the
young
man
stopped
him
with
a
quiet
laugh
munsher
said
he
i
nor
afraid
of
any
two
men
living
i
say
i
nor
afraid
of
any
two
men
living
and
certainly
not
of
the
two
that
bean
me
lately
if
they
the
two
i
think
they
are
flushed
in
a
way
quite
incomprehensible
to
the
speaker
who
nevertheless
continued
it
was
the
charges
he
said
with
some
slyness
in
his
smile
they
heavy
as
ye
say
and
that
the
very
reason
i
say
that
the
very
reason
why
i
staid
away
ye
see
eh
i
say
that
the
very
reason
i
staid
away
then
indeed
there
was
a
dew
for
the
maiden
to
wipe
from
her
brow
unconscious
that
every
word
that
was
being
said
bore
a
different
significance
in
the
mind
of
each
of
the
three
the
old
man
was
agitated
bud
sir
he
began
shaking
his
head
and
lifting
his
hand
bless
yer
soul
munsher
interrupted
the
irishman
the
use
o
grapplin
two
when
madjor
shaughnessy
cried

the
irishman
laughed

he
motioned
the
old
man
into
his
chair
and
both
sat
down
again
why
munsher

keepin

i
say
to
the
likes
mazaro
to
say
the
old
man

at
sea
would
be
too
feeble
an
expression
he
was
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
with
a
hurricane
of
doubts
and
fears
whirling
around
him
somebody
had
told
a
lie
and
he
having
struck
upon
its
sunken
surface
was
dazed
and
stunned
he
opened
his
lips
to
say
he
knew
not
what
when
his
ear
caught
the
voice
of
manuel
mazaro
replying
to
the
greeting
of
some
of
his
comrades
outside
the
front
door
he
is
comin
cried
the
old
man
mague

the
irishman
smiled
the
little
yellow
wretch
said
he
quietly
his
blue
eyes
dancing
goin
to
catch
a
certain
hidden
hearer
instantly
made
up
her
mind
to
rush
out
between
the
two
young
men
and
be
a
heroine

the

laughed
again
and
started
toward
the
door
indicated
but
in
an
instant
stopped
i
ca

he
said
that

oui

cried
the
other
softly
but
mazaro
step
was
near
i
just
slip
in
heer
and
the
amused
shaughnessy
tripped
lightly
to
the
closet
door
drew
it
open
in
spite
of
a
momentary
resistance
from
within
which
he
had
no
time
to
notice
stepped
into
a
small
recess
full
of
shelves
and
bottles
shut
the
door
and
stood
face
to
face
the
broad
moonlight
shining
upon
her
through
a
small
opening
on
one
side
with
pauline
at
the
same
instant
the
voice
of
the
young
cuban
sounded
in
the
room
pauline
was
in
a
great
tremor
she
made
as
if
she
would
have
opened
the
door
and
fled
but
the
irishman
gave
a
gesture
of
earnest
protest
and
the
door
might
make
the
back
parlor
of
the
café
des
exilés
a
scene
of
blood
thinking
of
this
what
could
she
do
she
staid
you
goth
a
senor
said
manuel
mazaro
taking
the
seat
so
lately
vacated
he
had
patted
tenderly
on
the
back
and
the
old
gentleman
had
flinched
hence
the
remark
to
which
there
was
no
reply
was
a
bee
crowth
a
the
the
continued
the
young
man
bud
dad
madjor
shaughnessy
demanded
with
the
little
sternness
he
could
command
mayor
shaughness
was
there
with
a
disparaging
smile
and
shake
of
the
head
to
you
senor
oh
no
the
old
man
smiled
bitterly
he
asked
oh
no
senor
mazaro
drew
his
chair
closer
senor
he
paused
eez

the
host
snapping
like
a
tormented
dog
talkin

the
young
man
noth

eh
the
irishman
and
the
maiden
looked
into
each
other
eyes
an
instant
as
people
will
do
when
listening
but
pauline
immediately
fell
and
when
mazaro
words
were
understood
her
blushes
became
visible
even
by
moonlight
he
emphatically
whispered
galahad
she
attempted
to
draw
back
a
step
but
found
herself
against
the
shelves
had
not
answered
mazaro
spoke
again
you
canno
eh
i
know

eh
pauline
trembled
her
father
summoned
all
his
force
and
rose
as
if
to
ask
his
questioner
to
leave
him
but
the
handsome
cuban
motioned
him
down
with
a
gesture
that
seemed
to
beg
for
only
a
moment
more
senor
if
one
man
whath
you
thaughter
all
is
possiblee
to
pauline
nervously
braiding
some
bits
of
wire
which
she
had
unconsciously
taken
from
a
shelf
glanced
up
against
her
will
into
the
eyes
of
galahad
they
were
looking
so
steadily
down
upon
her
that
with
a
great
leap
of
the
heart
for
joy
she
closed
her
own
and
half
turned
away
but
mazaro
had
not
ceased
all
is
possiblee
to
senor
you
let

again
rising

an
i
him
was
there
no
cause
for
quarrel
after
all
could
it
be
that
mazaro
was
about
to
speak
for
galahad
the
old
man
asked
in
his
simplicity
madjor
shaughnessy
mazaro
smiled
mockingly
mayor
shaughness
he
said
oh
no
not
mayor
shaughness
pauline
could
stay
no
longer
escape
she
must
though
it
be
in
manuel
mazaro
very
face
turning
again
and
looking
up
into
galahad
face
in
a
great
fright
she
opened
her
lips
to
speak
but
mayor
shaughness
continued
the
cuban
thaughter
galahad
was
putting
the
maiden
back
from
the
door
with
his
hand
pauline
he
said
it
a

pursued
the
cuban
if
a
was
possiblee
you

but
senor
made
a
majestic
sign
for
silence
he
had
resumed
his
chair
but
be
rose
up
once
more
took
the
cuban
hat
from
the
table
and
tendered
it
to
him

mazaro
i
to
you
that
what
i
he
stopped
aghast
galahad
and
pauline
stood
before
him
is
what
asked
the
man
with
a
look
of
quiet
delight
on
his
face
such
as
mazaro
instantly
remembered
to
have
seen
on
it
one
night
when
galahad
was
being
shot
at
in
the
sucking
calf
restaurant
in
peter
street
the
table
was
between
them
but
mazaro
hand
went
upward
toward
the
back
of
his
ah
ah
cried
the
irishman
shaking
his
head
with
a
broader
smile
and
thrusting
his
hand
threateningly
into
his
breast
do

the
cuban
trying
to

his

galahad
a

and
to

before
the

madjor
cried

said
galahad
advancing
a
step
toward
the
cuban
had
manuel
mazaro
wished
to
personate
the
prince
of
darkness
his
beautiful
face
had
the
correct
expression
for
it
he
slowly
turned
opened
the
door
into
the
café
sent
one
glowering
look
behind
and
disappeared
pauline
laid
her
hand
upon
her
lover
arm
madjor
began
her
father
oh
madjor
and
madjor
said
the
irishman
munsher
just
say
heer
a
gude
wife
fur
ye
and
i
let
the
little
serpent
go
thereupon
sure
enough
both
and
his
daughter
rushing
together
did
what
i
have
been
hoping
all
along
for
the
reader
sake
they
would
have
dispensed
with
they
burst
into
tears
whereupon
the
major
with
his
irish
appreciation
of
the
ludicrous
turned
away
to
hide
his
smirk
and
began
to
scratch
himself
first
on
the
temple
and
then
on
the
thigh
mazaro
passed
silently
through
the
group
about
the
and
not
many
minutes
afterward
galahad
shaughnessy
having
taken
a
place
among
the
exiles
rose
with
the
remark
that
the
old
gentleman
would
doubtless
be
willing
to
tell
them
was
accordingly
said
the
café
des
exilés
closed
her
windows
then
her
doors
winked
a
moment
or
two
through
the
cracks
in
the
shutters
and
then
went
fast
asleep
the
mexican
physician
at
galahad
request
told
mazaro
that
at
the
next
meeting
of
the
burial
society
he
might
and
must
occupy
his
accustomed
seat
without
fear
of
molestation
and
he
did
so
the
meeting
took
place
some
seven
days
after
the
affair
in
the
back
parlor
and
on
the
same
ground
business
being
finished
galahad
who
presided
stood
up
looking
in
his
white
duck
suit
among
his
companions
like
a
white
sheep
among
black
ones
and
begged
leave
to
order
dlasses
from
the
front
room
i
say
among
black
sheep
yet
i
suppose
than
that
double
row
of
languid
effeminate
faces
one
would
have
been
taxed
to
find
a
more
company
the
glasses
were
brought
and
filled
gentlemen
said
galahad
comrades
this
may
be
the
last
time
we
ever
meet
together
an
unbroken
body
martinez
of
san
domingo
he
of
the
horrible
experience
nodded
with
a
lurking
smile
curled
a
leg
under
him
and
clasped
his
fingers
behind
his
head
who
knows
continued
the
speaker
but
senor
benito
though
strong
and
sound
and
here
all
smiled
may
be
taken
ill
tomorrow
martinez
smiled
across
to
the
tall
gray
benito
on
galahad
left
and
he
in
turn
smilingly
showed
to
the
company
a
thin
white
line
of
teeth
between
his
moustachios
like
distant
reefs
who
knows
the
young
irishman
proceeded
to
inquire
i
say
who
knows
but
pedro
theyre
may
be
struck
wid
a
fever
pedro
a
short
compact
man
of
thoroughly
mixed
blood
and
with
an
eyebrow
cut
away
whose
surname
no
one
knew
smiled
his
acknowledgments
who
knows
resumed
galahad
when
those
who
understood
english
had
explained
in
spanish
to
those
who
did
not
but
they
may
soon
need
the
services
not
only
of
our
good
doctor
heer
but
of
our
society
and
that
fernandez
and
benigno
and
gonzalez
and
dominguez
may
not
be
chosen
to
see
on
that
very
schooner
lying
at
the
picayune
tier
just
now
their
beloved
remains
and
so
forth
safely
delivered
into
the
hands
and
lands
of
their
people
i
say
who
knows
bur
it
may
be
so
the
company
bowed
graciously
as
who
should
say
phrases
senor
and
if
so
be
that
such
is
their
approoching
fate
i
will
say
he
lifted
his
glass
and
the
rest
did
the
same
i
say
i
will
say
to
them
creoles
countrymen
and
lovers
boun
voyadge
an
good
luck
to
ye
for
several
moments
there
was
much
translating
bowing
and
murmured
acknowledgments
mazaro
said
and
all
around
among
the
long
double
rank
of
moustachioed
lips
amiable
teeth
were
gleaming
some
white
some
brown
some
yellow
like
bones
in
the
grass
and
now
gentlemen
galahad
recommenced
once
more
munsher
it
was
yer
practice
until
lately
to
reward
a
good
talker
with
a
dlass
from
the
hands
o
yer
daughter
si
bur
a
poor
speaker
si
senor
can
be
si
however
i
ask
ye
not
knowun
bur
it
may
be
the
last
time
we
all
meet
together
if
ye
will
not
let
the
goddess
of
the
café
des
exilés
grace
our
company
with
her
presence
for
just
about
one
minute
senor
si
every
head
was
turned
toward
the
old
man
nodding
the
echoed
request
ye
see
friends
said
galahad
in
a
true
irish
whisper
as
left
the
apartment
her
poseetion
has
been
more
and
more
embarrassin
daily
and
the
operaytions
of
our
society
were
likely
to
make
it
wurse
in
the
future
wherefore
i
have
lately
taken
steps
i
say
i
tuke
steps
this
morn
to
relieve
the
old
distresses
and
his
daughter
he
paused
entered
with
pauline
and
the
exiles
all
rose
up
ah
but
why
say
again
she
was
lovely
galahad
stepped
forward
to
meet
her
took
her
hand
led
her
to
the
head
of
the
board
and
turning
to
the
company
said
friends
and
misthress
shaughnessy
there
was
no
outburst
of
astonishment
only
the
same
old
bowing
smiling
and
murmuring
of
compliment
galahad
turned
with
a
puzzled
look
to
and
guessed
the
truth
in
the
joy
of
an
old
heart
he
had
already
that
afternoon
told
the
truth
to
each
and
every
man
separately
as
a
secret
too
deep
for
them
to
reveal
but
too
sweet
for
him
to
keep
the
major
and
pauline
were
man
and
wife
the
last
laugh
that
was
ever
heard
in
the
café
des
exilés
sounded
softly
through
the
room
lads
said
the
irishman
fill
yer
dlasses
here
to
the
café
des
exilés
god
bless
her
and
the
meeting
slowly
adjourned
two
days
later
signs
and
rumors
of
sickness
began
to
find
place
about
the
café
des
réfugiés
and
the
mexican
physician
made
three
calls
in
one
day
it
was
said
by
the
people
around
that
the
tall
cuban
gentleman
named
benito
was
very
sick
in
one
of
the
back
rooms
a
similar
frequency
of
the
same
physician
calls
was
noticed
about
the
café
des
exilés
the
man
with
one
eyebrow
said
the
neighbors
is
sick
pauline
left
the
house
yesterday
to
make
room
for
him
ah
is
it
possible
yes
it
is
really
true
she
and
her
husband
she
took
her
with
her
he
carried
it
he
came
back
alone
on
the
next
afternoon
the
children
about
the
café
des
réfugiés
enjoyed
the
spectacle
of
the
invalid
cuban
moved
on
a
trestle
to
the
café
des
exilés
although
he
did
not
look
so
deathly
sick
as
they
could
have
liked
to
see
him
and
on
the
fourth
morning
the
doors
of
the
café
des
exilés
remained
closed
a
funeral
notice
veiled
with
crape
announced
that
the
great
of
exiles
had
served
his
summons
upon
don
pedro
hernandez
surname
borrowed
for
the
occasion
and
don
carlos
mendez
y
benito
the
hour
for
the
funeral
was
fixed
at
four
it
never
took
place
down
at
the
picayune
tier
on
the
river
bank
there
was
about
two
that
same
day
a
slight
commotion
and
those
who
stood
aimlessly
about
a
small
neat
schooner
said
she
was
seized
at
four
there
suddenly
appeared
before
the
café
des
exilés
a
squad
of
men
with
silver
crescents
on
their
breasts
police
officers
the
old
cottage
sat
silent
with
closed
doors
the
crape
hanging
heavily
over
the
funeral
notice
like
a
widow
veil
the
little
unseen
garden
sending
up
odors
from
its
hidden
censers
and
the
old
bending
over
all
nobody
here
asks
the
leader
the
crowd
which
has
gathered
stares
without
answering
as
quietly
and
peaceably
as
possible
the
officers
pry
open
the
door
they
enter
and
the
crowd
pushes
in
after
there
are
the
two
coffins
looking
very
heavy
and
solid
lying
in
state
but
unguarded
the
crowd
draws
a
breath
of
astonishment
are
they
going
to
wrench
the
tops
off
with
hatchet
and
chisel
bap
rap
rap
wrench
rap
wrench
ah
the
cases
come
open
well
kept
asks
the
leader
flippantly
oh
yes
is
the
reply
and
then
all
laugh
one
of
the
pushes
up
and
gets
a
glimpse
within
what
is
it
ask
the
other
idlers
he
tells
one
quietly
what
did
he
say
ask
the
rest
one
of
another
he
says
they
are
not
dead
men
but
new
muskets
here
clear
out
cries
an
officer
and
the
loiterers
fall
back
and
by
and
by
straggle
off
the
exiles
what
became
of
them
do
you
ask
why
nothing
they
were
not
troubled
but
they
never
all
came
together
again
said
a
to
major
shaughnessy
years
afterward
major
there
was
only
one
thing
that
kept
your
expedition
from
succeeding
you
were
too
sly
about
it
had
you
come
out
flat
and
said
what
you
were
doing
we
never
a
word
to
you
but
that
little
fellow
gave
us
the
wink
and
then
we
had
to
stop
you
and
was
no
one
punished
alas
one
was
poor
pretty
traitorous
mazaro
he
was
drawn
out
of
carondelet
canal
cold
dead
and
when
his
wounds
were
counted
they
were
just
the
number
of
the
café
des
exilés
children
less
galahad
but
the
mother
that
is
the
old
café
did
not
see
it
she
had
gone
up
the
night
before
in
a
chariot
of
fire
in
the
files
of
the
old
picayune
and
of
may
be
seen
the
mention
of
galahad
shaughnessy
among
the
merchants
our
enterprising
and
accomplished
and
all
that
but
old
name
is
cut
in
marble
and
his
citizenship
is
in
a
city
whose
maker
and
builder
is
god
only
yesterday
i
dined
with
the
shaughnessys
fine
old
couple
and
handsome
their
children
sat
about
them
and
entertained
me
most
pleasantly
but
there
is
one
can
tell
a
tale
as
their
father
can
was
he
told
me
this
one
though
here
and
there
my
enthusiasm
may
have
taken
liberties
he
knows
the
history
of
every
old
house
in
the
french
quarter
or
if
he
happens
not
to
know
a
true
one
he
can
make
one
up
as
he
goes
along
belles
demoiselles
plantation
the
original

a

not
remember
every
thing
in
a
fit
of
forgetfulness
he
married
a
french
gentlewoman
rich
and
beautiful
and
brought
her
out
however
well
that
ends
well
a
famine
had
been
in

and
the

had
starved
leaving
nought
but
a
orphan
family
lurking
on

edge
of
the

our

in

the

a
twelvemonth
left

a
lovely

and
departed
led
out
of
this
vain
world
by
the
from
this
son
sprang
the
proud
creole
family
of
de
charleu
it
rose
straight
up
up
up
generation
after
generation
tall
branchless
slender
and
finally
in
the
time
of
which
i
am
to
tell
flowered
with
all
the
rare
beauty
of
a

the

and
little
septima
the
seven
beautiful
daughters
for
whom
their
home
had
been
fitly
named
belles
demoiselles
the
count
grant
had
once
been
a
long
pointe
round
which
the
mississippi
used
to
whirl
and
seethe
and
foam
that
it
was
horrid
to
behold
big
whirlpools
would
open
and
wheel
about
in
the
savage
eddies
under
the
low
bank
and
close
up
again
and
others
open
and
spin
and
disappear
great
circles
of
muddy
surface
would
boil
up
from
hundreds
of
feet
below
and
gloss
over
and
seem
to
float
away
sink
come
back
again
under
water
and
with
only
a
soft
hiss
surge
up
again
and
again
drift
off
and
vanish
every
few
minutes
the
loamy
bank
would
tip
down
a
great
load
of
earth
upon
its
besieger
and
fall
back
a
foot
sometimes
a
yard
and
the
writhing
river
would
press
after
until
at
last
the
pointe
was
quite
swallowed
up
and
the
great
river
glided
by
in
a
majestic
curve
and
asked
no
more
the
bank
stood
fast
the
caving
became
a
forgotten
misfortune
and
the
diminished
grant
was
a
long
sweeping
willowy
bend
rustling
with
miles
of
coming
up
the
mississippi
in
the
sailing
craft
of
those
early
days
about
the
time
one
first
could
descry
the
white
spires
of
the
old
louis
cathedral
you
would
be
pretty
sure
to
spy
just
over
to
your
right
under
the
levee
belles
demoiselles
mansion
with
its
broad
veranda
and
red
painted
cypress
roof
peering
over
the
embankment
like
a
bird
in
the
nest
half
hid
by
the
avenue
of
willows
which
one
of
the
departed
de
charleus
he
that
married
a
marot
had
planted
on
the
levee
crown
the
house
stood
unusually
near
the
river
facing
eastward
and
standing
with
an
immense
veranda
about
its
sides
and
a
flight
of
steps
in
front
spreading
broadly
downward
as
we
open
arms
to
a
child
from
the
veranda
nine
miles
of
river
were
seen
and
in
their
compass
near
at
hand
the
shady
garden
full
of
rare
and
beautiful
flowers
farther
away
broad
fields
of
cane
and
rice
and
the
distant
quarters
of
the
slaves
and
on
the
horizon
everywhere
a
dark
belt
of
cypress
forest
the
master
was
old
colonel
de
charleu
jean
albert
henri
joseph
de
and
colonel
by
the
grace
of
the
first
american
governor
monsieur
he
would
not
speak
to
any
one
who
called
him
colonel
was
a
patriarch
his
step
was
firm
his
form
erect
his
intellect
strong
and
clear
his
countenance
classic
serene
dignified
commanding
his
manners
courtly
his
voice
musical
fascinating
he
had
had
his
vices
all
his
life
but
had
borne
them
as
his
race
do
with
a
serenity
of
conscience
and
a
cleanness
of
mouth
that
left
no
outward
blemish
on
the
surface
of
the
gentleman
he
had
gambled
in
royal
street
drunk
hard
in
orleans
street
run
his
adversary
through
in
the
at
point
and
danced
and
quarrelled
at
the
quadroon
balls
even
now
with
all
his
courtesy
and
bounty
and
a
hospitality
which
seemed
to
be
entertaining
angels
he
was
and
penurious
and
deep
down
in
his
heart
loved
nothing
but
himself
his
name
and
his
motherless
children
but
these
their
ravishing
beauty
was
all
but
excuse
enough
for
the
unbounded
idolatry
of
their
father
against
these
seven
goddesses
he
never
rebelled
had
they
even
required
him
to
defraud
old
de
carlos
i
can
hardly
say
old
de
carlos
was
his
extremely
distant
relative
on
the
choctaw
side
with
this
single
exception
the
narrow
line
of
descent
from
the
indian
wife
diminished
to
a
mere
strand
by
injudicious
alliances
and
deaths
in
the
gutters
of
old
new
orleans
was
extinct
the
name
by
spanish
contact
had
become
de
carlos
but
this
one
surviving
bearer
of
it
was
known
to
all
and
known
only
as
injin
charlie
one
thing
i
never
knew
a
creole
to
do
he
will
not
utterly
go
back
on
the
ties
of
blood
no
matter
what
sort
of
knots
those
ties
may
be
for
one
reason
he
is
never
ashamed
of
his
or
his
father
sins
and
for
another
he
will
tell
you
he
is
all
heart
so
the
different
heirs
of
the
de
charleu
estate
had
always
strictly
regarded
the
rights
and
interests
of
the
de
carloses
especially
their
ownership
of
a
block
of
dilapidated
buildings
in
a
part
of
the
city
which
had
once
been
very
poor
property
but
was
beginning
to
be
valuable
this
block
had
much
more
than
maintained
the
last
de
carlos
through
a
long
and
lazy
lifetime
and
as
his
household
consisted
only
of
himself
and
an
aged
and
crippled
negress
the
inference
was
irresistible
that
he
had
money
old
charlie
though
by
an
injin
was
plainly
a
dark
white
man
about
as
old
as
colonel
de
charleu
sunk
in
the
bliss
of
deep
ignorance
shrewd
deaf
and
by
repute
at
least
unmerciful
the
colonel
and
he
always
conversed
in
english
this
rare
accomplishment
which
the
former
had
learned
from
his
scotch
wife
the
latter
from
traders
they
found
an
admirable
medium
of
communication
answering
better
than
french
could
a
similar
purpose
to
that
of
the
stick
which
we
fasten
to
the
bit
of
one
horse
and
of
another
whereby
each
keeps
his
distance
once
in
a
while
too
by
way
of
jest
english
found
its
way
among
the
ladies
of
belles
demoiselles
always
signifying
that
their
sire
was
about
to
have
business
with
old
charlie
now
a
wish
to
buy
out
charlie
troubled
the
colonel
he
had
no
desire
to
oust
him
unfairly
he
was
proud
of
being
always
fair
yet
he
did
long
to
engross
the
whole
estate
under
one
title
out
of
his
luxurious
idleness
he
had
conceived
this
desire
and
thought
little
of
so
slight
an
obstacle
as
being
already
somewhat
in
debt
to
old
charlie
for
money
borrowed
and
for
which
belles
demoiselles
was
of
course
good
ten
times
over
lots
buildings
rents
all
might
as
well
be
his
he
thought
to
give
keep
or
destroy
had
he
but
the
old
heritage
ah
he
might
bring
that
into
existence
which
his
had
been
begging
for
many
years
a
home
and
such
a
home
in
the
gay
city
here
he
should
tear
down
this
row
of
cottages
and
make
his
garden
wall
there
that
long
should
give
place
to
ardors
the
bakery
yonder
should
make
way
for
a
costly
conservatory
that
wine
warehouse
should
come
down
and
the
mansion
go
up
it
should
be
the
finest
in
the
state
men
should
never
pass
it
but
they
should
say
palace
of
the
de
charleus
a
family
of
grand
descent
a
people
of
elegance
and
bounty
a
line
as
old
as
france
a
fine
old
man
and
seven
daughters
as
beautiful
as
happy
whoever
dare
attempt
to
marry
there
must
leave
his
own
name
behind
him
the
house
should
be
of
stones
fitly
set
brought
down
in
ships
from
the
land
of
yankees
and
it
should
have
an
airy
belvedere
with
a
gilded
image
tiptoeing
and
shining
on
its
peak
and
from
it
you
should
see
far
across
the
gleaming
folds
of
the
river
the
red
roof
of
belles
demoiselles
the
at
the
big
stone
gate
there
should
be
a
porter
lodge
and
it
should
be
a
privilege
even
to
see
the
ground
truly
they
were
a
family
fine
enough
and
enough
to
have
fine
wishes
yet
happy
enough
where
they
were
to
have
had
no
wish
but
to
live
there
always
to
those
who
by
whatever
fortune
wandered
into
the
garden
of
belles
demoiselles
some
summer
afternoon
as
the
sky
was
reddening
towards
evening
it
was
lovely
to
see
the
family
gathered
out
upon
the
tiled
pavement
at
the
foot
of
the
broad
front
steps
gayly
chatting
and
jesting
with
that
ripple
of
laughter
that
comes
so
pleasingly
from
a
bevy
of
girls
the
father
would
be
found
seated
in
their
midst
the
centre
of
attention
and
compliment
witness
arbiter
umpire
critic
by
his
beautiful
children
unanimous
appointment
but
the
single
vassal
too
of
seven
absolute
sovereigns
now
they
would
draw
their
chairs
near
together
in
eager
discussion
of
some
new
step
in
the
dance
or
the
adjustment
of
some
rich
adornment
now
they
would
start
about
him
with
excited
comments
to
see
the
eldest
fix
a
bunch
of
violets
in
his
now
the
twins
would
move
down
a
walk
after
some
unusual
flower
and
be
greeted
on
their
return
with
the
high
pitched
notes
of
delighted
feminine
surprise
as
evening
came
on
they
would
draw
more
quietly
about
their
paternal
centre
often
their
chairs
were
forsaken
and
they
grouped
themselves
on
the
lower
steps
one
above
another
and
surrendered
themselves
to
the
tender
influences
of
the
approaching
night
at
such
an
hour
the
passer
on
the
river
already
attracted
by
the
dark
figures
of
the
mansion
and
its
woody
garden
standing
against
the
glowing
sunset
would
hear
the
voices
of
the
hidden
group
rise
from
the
spot
in
the
soft
harmonies
of
an
evening
song
swelling
clearer
and
clearer
as
the
thrill
of
music
warmed
them
into
feeling
and
presently
joined
by
the
deeper
tones
of
the
father
voice
then
as
the
daylight
passed
quite
away
all
would
be
still
and
he
would
know
that
the
beautiful
home
had
gathered
its
nestlings
under
its
wings
and
yet
for
mere
vagary
it
pleased
them
not
to
be
pleased
arti
called
one
sister
to
another
in
the
broad
hall
one
morning

amazement

horse

to
his
groom

bench

his
fashion
bound
in
a
madras
handkerchief

spirits

deferential
salutation

trusting
himself
to
his
feet

and
the
rumbled
off
in
muttered
oaths
like
thunder
out
on
the
gulf
the
incensed
old
colonel
wheeled
and
started
off
curl
colonel
said
charlie
standing
up
unsteadily
the
planter
turned
with
an
inquiring
frown
i
trade

said
charlie
the
colonel
was
tempted
you
trade
he
asked
my
house
for
yours
the
old
colonel
turned
pale
with
anger
he
walked
very
quickly
back
and
came
close
up
to
his
kinsman
charlie
he
said
injin
charlie
with
a
tipsy
nod
but
by
this
time
was
returning
sell
belles
demoiselles
to
you
he
said
in
a
high
key
and
then
laughed
ho
ho
ho
and
rode
away
a
cloud
but
not
a
dark
one
overshadowed
the
spirits
of
belles
demoiselles
plantation
the
old
master
whose
beaming
presence
had
always
made
him
a
shining
saturn
spinning
and
sparkling
within
the
bright
circle
of
his
daughters
fell
into
musing
fits
started
out
of
frowning
reveries
walked
often
by
himself
and
heard
business
from
his
overseer
fretfully
no
wonder
the
daughters
knew
his
closeness
in
trade
and
attributed
to
it
his
failure
to
negotiate
for
the
old
charlie
buildings
so
to
call
them
they
began
to
depreciate
belles
demoiselles
if
a
north
wind
blew
it
was
too
cold
to
ride
if
a
shower
had
fallen
it
was
too
muddy
to
drive
in
the
morning
the
garden
was
wet
in
the
evening
the
grasshopper
was
a
burden
was
turned
into
capital
every
headache
was
interpreted
a
premonition
of
ague
and
when
the
native
exuberance
of
a
flock
of
ladies
without
a
want
or
a
care
burst
out
in
laughter
in
the
father
face
they
spread
their
french
eyes
rolled
up
their
little
hands
and
with
rigid
wrists
and
mock
vehmence
vowed
and
vowed
again
that
they
only
laughed
at
their
misery
and
should
pine
to
death
unless
they
could
move
to
the
sweet
city
oh
the
theatre
oh
orleans
street
oh
the
masquerade
the
place
the
ball
and
they
would
call
upon
heaven
with
french
irreverence
and
fall
into
each
other
arms
and
whirl
down
the
hall
singing
a
waltz
end
with
a
grand
collision
and
fall
and
their
eyes
streaming
merriment
lay
the
blame
on
the
slippery
floor
that
would
some
day
be
the
death
of
the
whole
seven
three
times
more
the
fond
father
thus
goaded
managed
by
accident
business
accident
to
see
old
charlie
and
increase

the

himself

sullen
silence
followed

charlie

shouted
the
colonel
charlie
shook
his
head
again
fifty
he
shook
it
again
the
figures
rose
and
rose
to
the
answer
was
an
invitation
to
go
away
and
let
the
owner
alone
as
he
was
in
certain
specified
respects
the
vilest
of
living
creatures
and
no
company
for
a
fine
gentyman
the
fine
gentyman
longed
to
blaspheme
but
before
old
charlie
in
the
name
of
pride
how
could
he
he
mounted
and
started
away
tell
you
what

said
charlie
the
other
guessing
aright
turned
back
without
dismounting
smiling
how
much
belles
demoiselles
hoes

now
asked
the
deaf
one
one
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
dollars
said
the
colonel
firmly
yass
said
charlie
i
do
want
belle
demoiselles
the
old
colonel
quiet
laugh
intimated
it
made
no
difference
either
way
but
me
continued
charlie
me
i
got
le
compte
de

the
colonel
nodded
that
it

and

he
turned
to
go
into
the
house
just
too
soon
to
see
the
colonel
make
an
ugly
whisk
at
him
with
his
then
the
colonel
too
moved
off
two
or
three
times
over
as
he
ambled
homeward
laughter
broke
through
his
annoyance
as
he
recalled
old
charlie
family
pride
and
the
presumption
of
his
offer
yet
each
time
he
could
but
think
better
of
not
the
offer
to
swap
but
the
preposterous
ancestral
loyalty
it
was
so
much
better
than
he
could
have
expected
from
his
relative
and
not
unlike
his
own
whim
withal
the
proposition
which
went
with
it
was
forgiven
this
last
defeat
bore
so
harshly
on
the
master
of
belles
demoiselles
that
the
daughters
reading
chagrin
in
his
face
began
to
repent
they
loved
their
father
as
daughters
can
and
when
they
saw
their
pretended
dejection
harassing
him
seriously
they
restrained
their
complaints
displayed
more
than
ordinary
tenderness
and
heroically
and
ostentatiously
concluded
there
was
no
place
like
belles
demoiselles
but
the
new
mood
touched
him
more
than
the
old
and
only
refined
his
discontent
here
was
a
man
rich
without
the
care
of
riches
free
from
any
real
trouble
happiness
as
native
to
his
house
as
perfume
to
his
garden
deliberately
as
it
were
with
premeditated
malice
taking
joy
by
the
shoulder
and
bidding
her
be
gone
to
town
whither
he
might
easily
have
followed
only
that
the
very
same
ancestral
nonsense
that
kept
injin
charlie
from
selling
the
old
place
for
twice
its
value
prevented
him
from
choosing
any
other
spot
for
a
city
home
but
by
and
by
the
charm
of
nature
and
the
merry
hearts
around
him
prevailed
the
fit
of
exalted
sulks
passed
off
and
after
a
while
the
year
flared
up
at
christmas
flickered
and
went
out
new
year
came
and
passed
the
beautiful
garden
of
belles
demoiselles
put
on
its
spring
attire
the
seven
fair
sisters
moved
from
rose
to
rose
the
cloud
of
discontent
had
warmed
into
invisible
vapor
in
the
rich
sunlight
of
family
affection
and
on
the
common
memory
the
only
scar
of
last
year
wound
was
old
charlie
sheer
impertinence
in
crossing
the
caprice
of
the
de
charleus
the
cup
of
gladness
seemed
to
fill
with
the
filling
of
the
river
how
high
that
river
was
its
tremendous
current
rolled
and
tumbled
and
spun
along
hustling
the
long
funeral
flotillas
of
drift
and
how
near
shore
it
came
men
were
out
day
and
night
watching
the
levee
on
windy
nights
even
the
old
colonel
took
part
and
grew
with
occupation
and
excitement
as
every
minute
the
river
threw
a
white
arm
over
the
levee
top
as
though
it
would
vault
over
but
all
held
fast
and
as
the
summer
drifted
in
the
water
sunk
down
into
its
banks
and
looked
quite
incapable
of
harm
on
a
summer
afternoon
of
uncommon
mildness
old
colonel
jean
albert
henri
joseph
de
being
in
a
mood
for
revery
slipped
the
custody
of
his
feminine
rulers
and
sought
the
crown
of
the
levee
where
it
was
his
wont
to
promenade
presently
he
sat
upon
a
stone
bench
a
favorite
seat
before
him
lay
his
fields
near
by
his
lordly
mansion
and
being
still
perhaps
by
female
contact
somewhat
sentimental
he
fell
to
musing
on
his
past
it
was
hardly
worthy
to
be
proud
of
all
its
morning
was
reddened
with
mad
frolic
and
far
toward
the
meridian
it
was
marred
with
elegant
rioting
pride
had
kept
him
useless
and
despised
the
honors
won
by
valor
gaming
had
dimmed
prosperity
death
had
taken
his
heavenly
wife
voluptuous
ease
had
mortgaged
his
lands
and
yet
his
house
still
stood
his
fields
were
still
fruitful
his
name
was
fame
enough
and
yonder
and
yonder
among
the
trees
and
flowers
like
angels
walking
in
eden
were
the
seven
goddesses
of
his
only
worship
just
then
a
slight
sound
behind
him
brought
him
to
his
feet
he
cast
his
eyes
anxiously
to
the
outer
edge
of
the
little
strip
of
bank
between
the
levee
base
and
the
river
there
was
nothing
visible
he
paused
with
his
ear
toward
the
water
his
face
full
of
frightened
expectation
ha
there
came
a
single
plashing
sound
like
some
great
beast
slipping
into
the
river
and
little
waves
in
a
wide
came
out
from
under
the
bank
and
spread
over
the
water
my
god
he
plunged
down
the
levee
and
bounded
through
the
low
weeds
to
the
edge
of
the
bank
it
was
sheer
and
the
water
about
four
feet
below
he
did
not
stand
quite
on
the
edge
but
fell
upon
his
knees
a
couple
of
yards
away
wringing
his
hands
moaning
and
weeping
and
staring
through
his
watery
eyes
at
a
fine
long
crevice
just
discernible
under
the
matted
grass
and
curving
outward
on
either
hand
toward
the
river
my
god
he
sobbed
aloud
my
god
and
even
while
he
called
his
god
answered
the
tough
bermuda
grass
stretched
and
snapped
the
crevice
slowly
became
a
gape
and
softly
gradually
with
no
sound
but
the
closing
of
the
water
at
last
a
ton
or
more
of
earth
settled
into
the
boiling
eddy
and
disappeared
at
the
same
instant
a
pulse
of
the
breeze
brought
from
the
garden
behind
the
joyous
thoughtless
laughter
of
the
fair
mistresses
of
belles
demoiselles
the
old
colonel
sprang
up
and
clambered
over
the
levee
then
forcing
himself
to
a
more
composed
movement
he
hastened
into
the
house
and
ordered
his
horse
tell
my
children
to
make
merry
while
i
am
gone
he
left
word
i
shall
be
back
and
the
horse
hoofs
clattered
down
a
leading
to
the
city
charlie
said
the
planter
riding
up
to
a
window
from
which
the
old
man
nightcap
was
thrust
out

a
big
breathful
of
anger
but
charlie

i

the

like
monsieur
le

would
say

old
fool
i
want
to
shange
houses
wid
you
so
long
as
the
colonel
suspected
irony
he
was
angry
but
as
charlie
seemed
after
all
to
be
certainly
in
earnest
he
began
to
feel
he
was
by
no
means
a
tender
man
but
his
misfortune
had
unhinged
him
and
this
strange
undeserved
disinterested
family
fealty
on
the
part
of
charlie
touched
his
heart
and
should
he
still
try
to
lead
him
into
the
pitfall
he
had
dug
he
hesitated
no
he
would
show
him
the
place
by
broad
daylight
and
if
he
chose
to
overlook
the
caving
bank
it
would
be
his
own
fault
a
trade
a
trade
come
said
the
planter
come
at
my
house
we
look
at
the
place
before
breakfast
and
finish
the
trade
for
what
said
charlie
oh
because
i
got
to
come
in
town
in
the
morning
i
do
want
said
charlie
how
i
goin
to
come
dere
i
git
you
a
horse
at
the
liberty
stable
well
anyhow
i
do
care
i
go
and
they
went
when
they
had
ridden
a
long
time
and
were
on
the
road
darkened
by
hedges
of
cherokee
rose
the
colonel
called
behind
him
to
the
scion
keep
the
road
old
man
eh
keep
the
road
oh
yes
all
right
i
keep
my
word
we
do
goin
to
play
no
tricks
eh
but
the
colonel
seemed
not
to
hear
his
ungenerous
design
was
beginning
to
be
hateful
to
him
not
only
old
charlie
unprovoked
goodness
was
prevailing
the
eulogy
on
belles
demoiselles
had
stirred
the
depths
of
an
intense
love
for
his
beautiful
home
true
if
he
held
to
it
the
caving
of
the
bank
at
its
present
fearful
speed
would
let
the
house
into
the
river
within
three
months
but
were
it
not
better
to
lose
it
so
than
sell
his
birthright
again
coming
back
to
the
first
thought
to
betray
his
own
blood
it
was
only
injin
charlie
but
had
not
the
de
charleu
blood
just
spoken
out
in
him
unconsciously
he
groaned
after
a
time
they
struck
a
path
approaching
the
plantation
in
the
rear
and
a
little
after
passing
from
behind
a
clump
of
they
came
in
sight
of
the
villa
it
looked
so
like
a
gem
shining
through
its
dark
grove
so
like
a
great
in
the
dense
foliage
so
significant
of
luxury
and
gayety
that
the
poor
master
from
an
overflowing
heart
groaned
again
what
asked
charlie
the
colonel
only
drew
his
rein
and
dismounting
mechanically
contemplated
the
sight
before
him
the
high
arched
doors
and
windows
were
thrown
wide
to
the
summer
air
from
every
opening
the
bright
light
of
numerous
candelabra
darted
out
upon
the
sparkling
foliage
of
magnolia
and
bay
and
here
and
there
in
the
spacious
verandas
a
colored
lantern
swayed
in
the
gentle
breeze
a
sound
of
revel
fell
on
the
ear
the
music
of
harps
and
across
one
window
brighter
than
the
rest
flitted
once
or
twice
the
shadows
of
dancers
but
oh
the
shadows
flitting
across
the
heart
of
the
fair
mansion
master
old
charlie
said
he
gazing
fondly
at
his
house
you
and
me
is
both
old
eh
yaas
said
the
stolid
charlie
and
we
has
both
been
bad
enough
in
our
times
eh
charlie
charlie
surprised
at
the
tender
tone
repeated
yaas
and
you
and
me
is
mighty
close
blame
close
yaas
but
you
never
know
me
to
cheat
old
man
no
impassively
and
do
you
think
i
would
cheat
you
now
i
dunno
said
charlie
i
do
believe
well
old
man
old
man
his
voice
began
to
quiver
i
cheat
you
now
my
god
old
man
i
tell
you
you
better
not
make
the
trade
because
for
what
asked
charlie
in
plain
anger
but
both
looked
quickly
toward
the
house
the
colonel
tossed
his
hands
wildly
in
the
air
rushed
forward
a
step
or
two
and
giving
one
fearful
scream
of
agony
and
fright
fell
forward
on
his
face
in
the
path
old
charlie
stood
transfixed
with
horror
belles
demoiselles
the
realm
of
maiden
beauty
the
home
of
merriment
the
house
of
dancing
all
in
the
tremor
and
glow
of
pleasure
suddenly
sunk
with
one
short
wild
wail
of
terror
sunk
sunk
down
down
down
into
the
merciless
unfathomable
flood
of
the
mississippi
twelve
long
months
were
midnight
to
the
mind
of
the
childless
father
when
they
were
only
half
gone
he
took
his
bed
and
every
day
and
every
night
old
charlie
the
the
fool
watched
him
tenderly
tended
him
lovingly
for
the
sake
of
his
name
his
misfortunes
and
his
broken
heart
no
woman
step
crossed
the
floor
of
the
whose
western
overpeered
the
dingy
architecture
of
old
charlie
block
charlie
and
a
skilled
physician
the
one
all
interest
the
other
all
gentleness
hope
and
patience
these
only
entered
by
the
door
but
by
the
window
came
in
a
evergreen
vine
transplanted
from
the
caving
bank
of
belles
demoiselles
it
caught
the
rays
of
sunset
in
its
flowery
net
and
let
then
softly
in
upon
the
sick
man
bed
gathered
the
glancing
beams
of
the
moon
at
midnight
and
often
wakened
the
sleeper
to
look
with
his
mindless
eyes
upon
their
pretty
silver
fragments
strewn
upon
the
floor
by
and
by
there
seemed
there
was
a
twinkling
dawn
of
returning
reason
slowly
peacefully
with
an
increase
unseen
from
day
to
day
the
light
of
reason
came
into
the
eyes
and
speech
became
coherent
but
withal
there
came
a
failing
of
the
wrecked
body
and
the
doctor
said
that
monsieur
was
both
better
and
worse
one
evening
as
charlie
sat
by
the
window
with
his
fireless
pipe
in
his
hand
the
old
colonel
eyes
fell
full
upon
his
own
and
rested
there
charl
he
said
with
an
effort
and
his
delighted
nurse
hastened
to
the
bedside
and
bowed
his
best
ear
there
was
an
unsuccessful
effort
or
two
and
then
he
whispered
smiling
with
sweet
sadness
we
did
trade
the
truth
in
this
case
was
a
secondary
matter
to
charlie
the
main
point
was
to
give
a
pleasing
answer
so
he
nodded
his
head
decidedly
as
who
should
say
oh
yes
we
did
it
was
a
swap
but
when
he
saw
the
smile
vanish
he
tried
the
other
expedient
and
shook
his
head
with
still
more
vigor
to
signify
that
they
had
not
so
much
as
approached
a
bargain
and
the
smile
returned
charlie
wanted
to
see
the
vine
recognized
he
stepped
backward
to
the
window
with
a
broad
smile
shook
the
foliage
nodded
and
looked
smart
i
know
said
the
colonel
with
beaming
eyes
many
weeks
the
next
day
charl
the
best
ear
went
down
send
for
a
priest
the
priest
came
and
was
alone
with
him
a
whole
afternoon
when
he
left
the
patient
was
very
haggard
and
exhausted
but
smiled
and
would
not
suffer
the
crucifix
to
be
removed
from
his
breast
one
more
morning
came
just
before
dawn
charlie
lying
on
a
pallet
in
the
room
thought
he
was
called
and
came
to
the
bedside
old
man
whispered
the
failing
invalid
is
it
caving
yet
charlie
nodded
it
wo
pay
you
out
oh
dat
makes
said
charlie
two
big
tears
rolled
down
his
brown
face
dat
makes
the
colonel
whispered
once
more
belles
demoiselles
in
paradise
in
the
garden
i
shall
be
with
them
at
sunrise
and
so
it
was
posson
jone
footnote
published
in
appletons
journal
republished
by
permission
to
jules
elegant
little
heathen
there
yet
remained
at
manhood
a
remembrance
of
having
been
to
school
and
of
having
been
taught
by
a
capuchin
that
the
world
is
round
for
example
like
a
cheese
this
round
world
is
a
cheese
to
be
eaten
through
and
jules
had
nibbled
quite
into
his
already
at
he
realized
this
as
he
idled
about
one
sunday
morning
where
the
intersection
of
royal
and
conti
streets
some
seventy
years
ago
formed
a
central
corner
of
new
orleans
yes
yes
the
trouble
was
he
had
been
wasteful
and
honest
he
discussed
the
matter
with
that
faithful
friend
and
confidant
baptiste
his
yellow
they
concluded
that
papa
patience
and
having
been
gnawed
away
quite
to
the
rind
there
were
left
open
only
these
few
resorts
to
go
to
work
they
shuddered
to
join
major
innerarity
filibustering
expedition
or
else
why
not
to
try
some
games
of
confidence
at
one
must
begin
to
be
something
nothing
else
tempted
could
that
avail
one
could
but
try
it
is
noble
to
try
and
besides
they
were
hungry
if
one
could
make
the
friendship
of
some
person
from
the
country
for
instance
with
money
not
expert
at
cards
or
dice
but
as
one
would
say
willing
to
learn
one
might
find
cause
to
say
some
hail
marys
the
sun
broke
through
a
clearing
sky
and
baptiste
pronounced
it
good
for
luck
there
had
been
a
hurricane
in
the
night
the
were
still
dripping
and
from
lofty
brick
and
low
adobe
walls
a
rising
steam
responded
to
the
summer
sunlight
and
across
the
rue
du
canal
one
could
get
glimpses
of
the
gardens
in
faubourg
standing
in
silent
wretchedness
so
many
tearful
lucretias
tattered
victims
of
the
storm
short
remnants
of
the
wind
now
and
then
came
down
the
narrow
street
in
erratic
puffs
heavily
laden
with
odors
of
broken
boughs
and
torn
flowers
skimmed
the
little
pools
of
in
the
deep
ruts
of
the
unpaved
street
and
suddenly
went
away
to
nothing
like
a
juggler
butterflies
or
a
young
man
money
it
was
very
picturesque
the
rue
royale
the
rich
and
poor
met
together
the
locksmith
swinging
key
creaked
next
door
to
the
bank
across
the
way
crouching
in
the
shadow
of
a
great
was
the
mud
laboratory
of
the
mender
of
broken
combs
light
balconies
overhung
the
rows
of
showy
shops
and
stores
open
for
trade
this
sunday
morning
and
pretty
latin
faces
of
the
higher
class
glanced
over
their
railings
upon
the
passers
below
at
some
windows
hung
lace
certains
flannel
duds
at
some
and
at
others
only
the
scraping
and
sighing
shutter
groaning
toward
paris
after
its
neglectful
master
stood
looking
up
and
down
the
street
for
nearly
an
hour
but
few
ladies
only
the
inveterate
were
out
about
the
entrance
of
the
frequent
the
masculine
gentility
stood
leaning
on
canes
with
which
now
one
and
now
another
beckoned
to
jules
some
even
adding
pantomimic
hints
of
the
social
cup
remarked
to
his
servant
without
turning
his
head
that
somehow
he
felt
sure
he
should
soon
return
those
that
the
mulatto
had
lent
him
what
will

with
them

baptiste

sick
horses
but
a
fight
i
would
not
miss
it
two
or
three
persons
ran
to
the
opposite
corner
and
commenced
striking
at
something
with
their
canes
others
followed
can
and
servant
who
hasten
forward
can
the
creoles
cubans
spaniards
san
domingo
refugees
and
other
loungers

hope

a
fight

a
man
in
a
fit
the
crowd
pours
in
from
the
have
they
killed
a
snake
bareheaded
shopmen
leave
their
wives
who
stand
upon
chairs
the
crowd
huddles
and
packs
those
on
the
outside
make
little
leaps
into
the
air
trying
to
be
tall
what
is
the
matter
have
they
caught
a
real
live
rat
who
is
hurt
asks
some
one
in

replies
a
shopkeeper

in

but
he
has
it
now
jules
pick

in

homespun
asks

a
bah
but
wait
he
is
speaking
listen
to
who
is
he
speak
to
jules
jules
who
silence
you
to
jules
what
howe
me
a
bill
since
long
time
then
the
voice
was
heard
its
owner
was
a
man
of
giant
stature
with
a
slight
stoop
in
his
shoulders
as
if
he
was
making
a
constant
attempt
to
accommodate
himself
to
ordinary
doors
and
ceilings
his
bones
were
those
of
an
ox
his
face
was
marked
more
by
weather
than
age
and
his
narrow
brow
was
bald
and
smooth
he
had
instantaneously
formed
an
opinion
of
jules
and
the
multitude
of
words
most
of
them
lingual
curiosities
with
which
he
was
rasping
the
ears
of
his
listeners
signified
in
short
that
as
sure
as
his
name
was
parson
jones
the
little
creole
was
a
plum
gentleman
bowed
and
smiled
and
was
about
to
call
attention
by
both
gesture
and
speech
to
a
singular
object
on
top
of
the
still
uncovered
head
when
the
nervous
motion
of
the
anticipated
him
as
throwing
up
an
immense
hand
he
drew
down
a
large
roll
of
the
crowd
laughed
the
joining
and
began
to
disperse
why
that
money
belongs
to
smyrny
church
said
the
giant
you
are
very
dengerous
to
make
your
money
expose
like
that
misty
posson
jone
said
counting
it
with
his
eyes
the
countryman
gave
a
start
and
smile
of
surprise
how
know
my
name
was
jones
he
asked
but
without
pausing
for
the
creole
answer
furnished
in
his
reckless
way
some
further
specimens
of
english
and
the
conciseness
with
which
he
presented
full
intelligence
of
his
home
family
calling
and
present
and
future
plans
might
have
passed
for
consummate
art
had
it
not
been
the
most
nature
and
i
done
been
to

you

did
the
friends

briskly
off
followed
by
baptiste
and
a
short
square
old
negro
very
black
and
grotesque
who
had
introduced
himself
to
the
mulatto
with
many
glittering
and
cavernous
smiles
as
of
mr
jones
both
pairs
enlivened
their
walk
with
conversation
parson
jones
descanted
upon
the
doctrine

had
mentioned
as
illustrated
in
the
perplexities
of

concluded
that

entered
the
dark
rear
corner
of
a
low
grocery
where
the
law
notwithstanding
liquor
was
covertly
sold
to
slaves
there
in
the
quiet
company
of
baptiste
and
the
grocer

down

rue

several
corners
and
by
and
by

into
a
cross
street

instant

were
turning
and
looked
back

the
street

answered
the
parson
with
an
anxious
face
i
reckon
him
though
and
they
went
on
the
street
they
now
entered
was
a
very
quiet
one
the
eye
of
any
chance
passer
would
have
been
at
once
drawn
to
a
broad
heavy
white
brick
edifice
on
the
lower
side
of
the
way
with
a
standing
out
like
a
bowsprit
from
one
of
its
great
windows
and
a
pair
of
lamps
hanging
before
a
large
closed
entrance
it
was
a
theatre
with
at
this
morning
hour
all
was
still
and
the
only
sign
of
life
was
a
knot
of
little
barefoot
girls
gathered
within
its
narrow
shade
and
each
carrying
an
infant
relative
into
this
place
the
parson
and
entered
the
little
nurses
jumping
up
from
the
sills
to
let
them
pass
in
a
may
have
passed
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
whole
juvenile
company
were
laying
alternate
eyes
and
ears
to
the
chinks
to
gather
what
they
could

interesting

all
was
still
the
peeping
children
could
see
the
parson
as
he
lifted
his
hand
to
his
there
it
paused
a
moment
in
bewilderment
then
plunged
to
the
bottom
it
came
back
empty
and
fell
lifelessly
at
his
side
his
head
dropped
upon
his
breast
his
eyes
were
for
a
moment
closed
his
broad
palms
were
lifted
and
pressed
against
his
forehead
a
tremor
seized
him
and
he
fell
all
in
a
lump
to
the
floor
the
children
ran
off
with
their
leaving
jules
swearing
by
all
his
deceased
relatives
first
to
miguel
and
joe
and
then
to
the
lifted
parson
that
he
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
the
money
except
if
the
black
man
had
got
it
in
the
rear
of
ancient
new
orleans
beyond
the
sites
of
the
old
rampart
a
trio
of
spanish
forts
where
the
town
has
since
sprung
up
and
grown
old
green
with
all
the
luxuriance
of
the
wild
creole
summer
lay
the
congo
plains
here
stretched
the
canvas
of
the
historic
cayetano
who
sunday
after
sunday
sowed
the
sawdust
for
his
but
the
great
showman
had
fallen
short
of
his
printed
promise
the
hurricane
had
come
by
night
and
with
one
fell
swash
had
made
an
irretrievable
sop
of
every
thing
the
circus
trailed
away
its
bedraggled
magnificence
and
the
ring
was
cleared
for
the
bull
then
the
sun
seemed
to
come
out
and
work
for
the
people
see
said
the
spaniards
looking
up
at
the
glorious
sky
with
its
great
white
fleets
drawn
off
upon
the
horizon
see
heaven
smiles
upon
the
in
the
high
upper
seats
of
the
rude
amphitheatre
sat
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
gascons
from
the
along
the
ridge
and
the
chattering
spanish
women
of
the
market
their
shining
hair
to
the
sun
next
below
were
their
husbands
and
lovers
in
sunday
blouses
milkmen
butchers
bakers
fishermen
sicilian
fruiterers
swarthy
portuguese
sailors
in
little
woollen
caps
and
strangers
of
the
graver
sort
mariners
of
england
germany
and
holland
the
lowest
seats
were
full
of
trappers
smugglers
canadian
drinking
and
singing
too
more
the
shame
from
the
upper
rivers
who
will
not
keep
their
seats
who
ply
the
bottle
and
who
will
get
home
by
and
by
and
tell
how
wicked
sodom
is
mexicans
too
with
their
copper
cheeks
and
bat
eyes
and
their
tinkling
spurred
heels
yonder
in
that
quieter
section
are
the
quadroon
women
in
their
black
lace
shawls
and
there
is
baptiste
and
below
them
are
the
turbaned
black
women
and
there
is
but
he
vanishes
colossus
the
afternoon
is
advancing
yet
the
sport
though
loudly
demanded
does
not
begin
the
grow
derisive
and
find
pastime
in
gibes
and
raillery
they
mock
the
various
latins
with
their
national
inflections
and
answer
their
scowls
with
laughter
some
of
the
more
aggressive
shout
pretty
french
greetings
to
the
women
of
gascony
and
one
bargeman
amid
peals
of
applause
stands
on
a
seat
and
hurls
a
kiss
to
the
quadroons
the
mariners
of
england
germany
and
holland
as
spectators
like
the
fun
while
the
spaniards
look
black
and
cast
defiant
imprecations
upon
their
persecutors
some
gascons
with
timely
caution
pick
their
women
out
and
depart
running
a
terrible
fire
of
gallantries
in
hope
of
truce
a
new
call
is
raised
for
the
bull
the
bull
the
bull
hush
in
a
tier
near
the
ground
a
man
is
standing
and
calling
standing
head
and
shoulders
above
the
rest
callimg
in
the
tongue
another
man
big
and
red
named
joe
and
a
handsome
little
creole
in
elegant
dress
and
full
of
laughter
wish
to
stop
him
but
the
and
cheering
will
not
suffer
it
ah
through
some
shameful
knavery
of
the
men
into
whose
hands
he
has
fallen
he
is
drunk
even
the
women
can
see
that
and
now
he
throws
his
arms
wildly
and
raises
his
voice
until
the
whole
great
circle
hears
it
he
is
preaching
ah
kind
lord
for
a
special
providence
now
the
men
of
his
own
nation
men
from
the
land
of
the
open
english
bible
and
temperance
cup
and
song
are
cheering
him
on
to
mad
disgrace
and
now
another
call
for
the
appointed
sport
is
drowned
by
the
singing
the
ancient
tune
of
mear
you
can
hear
the
words
old
grimes
is
dead
that
good
old
soul
from
ribald
lips
and
throats
turned
brazen
with
laughter
from
singers
who
toss
their
hats
aloft
and
roll
in
their
seats
the
chorus
swells
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
thousand
brogans
he
used
to
wear
an
old
gray
coat
all
buttoned
down
before
a
ribboned
man
in
the
arena
is
trying
to
be
heard
and
the
latins
raise
one
mighty
cry
for
silence
the
big
red
man
gets
a
hand
over
the
parson
mouth
and
the
ribboned
man
seizes
his
moment
they
have
been
endeavoring
for
hours
he
says
to
draw
the
terrible
animals
from
their
dens
but
such
is
their
strength
and
fierceness
that
his
voice
is
drowned
enough
has
been
heard
to
warrant
the
inference
that
the
beasts
can
not
be
whipped
out
of
the
cages
to
which
and
long
starvation
have
attached
them
and
from
the
roar
of
indignation
the
man
of
ribbons
flies
the
noise
increases
men
are
standing
up
by
hundreds
and
women
are
imploring
to
be
let
out
of
the
turmoil
all
at
once
like
the
bursting
of
a
dam
the
whole
mass
pours
down
into
the
ring
they
sweep
across
the
arena
and
over
the
showman
barriers
miguel
gets
a
frightful
trampling
who
cares
for
gates
or
doors
they
tear
the
beasts
houses
bar
from
bar
and
laying
hold
of
the
gaunt
buffalo
drag
him
forth
by
feet
ears
and
tail
and
in
the
midst
of
the
still
head
and
shoulders
above
all
wilder
with
the
cup
of
the
wicked
than
any
beast
is
the
man
of
god
from
the
florida
parishes
in
his
arms
he
bore
and
all
the
people
shouted
at
once
when
they
saw
it
the
tiger
he
had
lifted
it
high
up
with
its
back
to
his
breast
his
arms
clasped
under
its
shoulders
the
wretched
brute
had
curled
up
with
its
long
tail
against
its
belly
and
through
its
filed
teeth
grinned
a
fixed
and
impotent
wrath
and
parson
jones
was
shouting
the
tiger
and
the
buffler
lay
down
together
you
dah
to
say
they
shay
and
i
comb
you
with
this
varmint
from
head
to
foot
the
tiger
and
the
buffler
lay
down
together
they
now
you
joe
behold
i
am
here
to
see
it
done
the
lion
and
the
buffler
lay
down
together
mouthing
these
words
again
and
again
the
parson
forced
his
way
through
the
surge
in
the
wake
of
the
buffalo
this
creature
the
latins
had
secured
by
a
lariat
over
his
head
and
were
dragging
across
the
old
rampart
and
into
a
street
of
the
city
the
northern
races
were
trying
to
prevent
and
there
was
pommelling
and
knocking
down
cursing
and
until
jules
was
quite
carried
away
with
the
fun
laughed
clapped
his
hands
and
swore
with
delight
and
ever
kept
close
to
the
gallant
parson
joe
contrariwise
counted
all
this
an
interruption
he
had
come
to
find
colossus
and
the
money
in
an
unlucky
moment
he
made
bold
to
lay
hold
of
the
parson
but
a
piece
of
the
broken
barriers
in
the
hands
of
a
felled
him
to
the
sod
the
terrible
crowd
swept
over
him
the
lariat
was
cut
and
the
giant
parson
hurled
the
tiger
upon
the
buffalo
back
in
another
instant
both
brutes
were
dead
at
the
hands
of
the
mob
jones
was
lifted
from
his
feet
and
prating
of
scripture
and
the
millennium
of
paul
at
ephesus
and
daniel
in
the
buffler
den
was
borne
aloft
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
huzzaing
half
an
hour
later
he
was
sleeping
heavily
on
the
floor
of
a
cell
in
the
when
parson
jones
awoke
a
bell
was
somewhere
tolling
for
midnight

was
at
the
door
of
his
cell
with
a
key
the
lock
grated
the
door
swung
the
turnkey
looked
in
and
stepped
back
and
a
ray
of
moonlight
fell
upon
jules
the
prisoner

upon
the
empty
shackles
and
in
the
centre
of
the
floor

mass
of
and
and

the
parson
regarding

with
a
sadness
incomprehensible
to
jules
it

the
effect
so
soon
the
daylight
jools
my
friend
your
kindness

the
creole
face
became
a
perfect
blank
because

the
parson
for
two
reasons

stood
up
aghast
and
for
a
moment
speechless
at
this
exhibition
of
moral
heroism
but
an
artifice
was
presently
hit
upon
posson

his
old
de
order

it
is
in
french
compel
you

so
cried
the
parson
bounding
up
with
radiant
face
is
that
so
jools
the
young
man
nodded
smiling
but
though
he
smiled
the
fountain
of
his
tenderness
was
opened
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
as
the
parson
knelt
in
prayer
and
even
whispered
hail
mary
quite
through
twice
over
morning
broke
in
summer
glory
upon
a
cluster
of
villas
behind
the
city
nestled
under
and
magnolias
on
the
banks
of
a
deep
bayou
and
known
as
suburb
jean
with
the
first
beam
came
the
and
the
creole
out
upon
the
bank
below
the
village
upon
the
parson
arm
hung
a
pair
of
antique
baptiste
limped
wearily
behind
both
his
eyes
were
encircled
with
broad
blue
rings
and
one
bore
the
official
impress
of
every
knuckle
of
colossus
left
hand
the
beautiful
to
take
care
of
somebody
had
lost
his
charge
at
mention
of
the
negro
he
became
wild
and
half
in
english
half
in
the
gumbo
dialect
said
murderous
things
intimidated
by
jules
to
calmness
he
became
able
to
speak
confidently
on
one
point
he
could
would
and
did
swear
that
colossus
had
gone
home
to
the
florida
parishes
he
was
almost
certain
in
fact
he
thought
so
there
was
a
clicking
of
pulleys
as
the
three
appeared
upon
the
margin
and
baptiste
pointed
out
in
the
deep
shadow
of
a
great
oak
the
isabella
moored
among
the
bulrushes
and
just
spreading
her
sails
for
departure
moving
down
to
where
she
lay
the
parson
and
his
friend
paused
on
the
bank

to
say

baptiste
uttered
a
cry
and
presently
ran
by
his
master
toward
the
schooner
his
hands
full
of
clods
looked
just
in
time
to
see
the
sable
form
of
colossus
of
rhodes
emerge
from
the
vessel
hold
and
the
pastor
of
smyrna
and
bethesda
seize
him
in
his
embrace
o
colossus
you
outlandish
old
nigger
thank
the
lord
thank
the
lord
the
little
creole
almost
wept
he
ran
down
the
laughing
and
swearing
and
making
confused
allusion
to
the
entire
and
furniture
of
the
lower
regions
by
odd
fortune
at
the
moment
that
further
demonstrated
his
delight
by
tripping
his
mulatto
into
a
bog
the
schooner
came
brushing
along
the
reedy
bank
with
a
graceful
curve
the
sails
flapped
and
the
crew
fell
to
poling
her
slowly
along
parson
jones
was
on
the
deck
kneeling
once
more
in
prayer
his
hat
had
fallen
before
him
behind
him
knelt
his
slave
in
thundering
tones
he
was
confessing
himself
a
plum
fool
from
whom
the
conceit
had
been
jolted
out
and
who
had
been
made
to
see
that
even
his
nigger
had
the
longest
head
of
the
two
colossus
clasped
his
hands
and
groaned
the
parson
prayed
for
a
contrite
heart
oh
yes
cried
colossus
the
master
acknowledged
countless
mercies
dat
so
cried
the
slave
the
master
prayed
that
they
might
still
be
piled
on
glory
cried
the
black
man
clapping
his
hands
pile
on
an
now
continued
the
parson
bring
this
pore
backslidin
jackace
of
a
parson
and
this
pore
ole
fool
nigger
back
to
thar
home
in
peace
pray
fo

colossus
but
the
parson
prayed
for
jules
pray
fo
de
repeated
the
negro
and
oh
give
thy
servant
back
that
there
lost
money
colossus
rose
stealthily
and
tiptoed
by
his
still
shouting
master
the
captain
the
crew
gazed
in
silent
wonder
at
the
strategist
pausing
but
an
instant
over
the
master
hat
to
grin
an
acknowledgment
of
his
beholders
speechless
interest
he
softly
placed
in
it
the
and
smyrna
fund
then
saluted
by
the
gesticulative
silent
applause
of
and
the
he
resumed
his
first
attitude
behind
his
roaring
master
amen
cried
colossus
meaning
to
bring
him
to
a
close
onworthy
though
i
be
cried
jones
reiterated
the
negro
said
parson
jones
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
stooping
to
take
up
his
hat
beheld
the
roll
as
one
stunned
he
gazed
for
a
moment
upon
his
slave
who
still
knelt
with
clasped
hands
and
rolling
eyeballs
but
when
he
became
aware
of
the
laughter
and
cheers
that
greeted
him
from
both
deck
and
shore
he
lifted
eyes
and
hands
to
heaven
and
cried
like
the
veriest
babe
and
when
he
looked
at
the
roll
again
and
hugged
and
kissed
it
tried
to
raise
a
second
shout
but
choked
and
the
crew
fell
to
their
poles
and
now
up
runs
baptiste
covered
with
slime
and
prepares
to
cast
his
projectiles
the
first
one
fell
wide
of
the
mark
the
schooner
swung
round
into
a
long
reach
of
water
where
the
breeze
was
in
her
favor
another
shout
of
laughter
drowned
the
maledictions
of
the
muddy
man
the
sails
filled
colossus
of
rhodes
smiling
and
bowing
as
hero
of
the
moment
ducked
as
the
main
boom
swept
round
and
the
schooner
leaning
slightly
to
the
pleasant
influence
rustled
a
moment
over
the
bulrushes
and
then
sped
far
away
down
the
rippling
bayou
jules
stood
long
gazing
at
the
receding
vessel
as
it
now
disappeared
now
beyond
the
tops
of
the
high
undergrowth
but
when
an
arm
of
the
forest
hid
it
finally
from
sight
he
turned
townward
followed
by
that
spaniel
his
servant
saying
as
he
turned
baptiste
you
know
i
goin
do
wid
dis
money
well
you
can
strike
me
dead
if
i
do
goin
to
pay
hall
my
debts
he
began
a
merry
little
song
to
the
effect
that
his
sweetheart
was
a
and
master
and
man
leaving
care
behind
returned
to
the
picturesque
rue
royale
the
ways
of
providence
are
indeed
strange
in
all
parson
jones
amid
the
many
painful
reminiscences
of
his
visit
to
the
city
of
the
plain
the
sweet
knowledge
was
withheld
from
him
that
by
the
light
of
the
christian
virtue
that
shone
from
him
even
in
his
great
fall
jules
arose
and
went
to
his
father
an
honest
man
poquelin
in
the
first
decade
of
the
present
century
when
the
newly
established
american
government
was
the
most
hateful
thing
in
louisiana
when
the
creoles
were
still
kicking
at
such
vile
innovations
as
the
trial
by
jury
american
dances
laws
and
the
printing
of
the
governor
proclamation
in
english
when
the
flood
that
was
presently
to
burst
in
a
crevasse
of
immigration
upon
the
delta
had
thus
far
been
felt
only
as
slippery
seepage
which
made
the
creole
tremble
for
his
footing
there
stood
a
short
distance
above
what
is
now
canal
street
and
considerably
back
from
the
line
of
villas
which
fringed
the
on
tchoupitoulas
road
an
old
colonial
half
in
ruin
it
stood
aloof
from
civilization
the
tracts
that
had
once
been
its
indigo
fields
given
over
to
their
first
noxious
wildness
and
grown
up
into
one
of
the
horridest
marshes
within
a
circuit
of
fifty
miles
the
house
was
of
heavy
cypress
lifted
up
on
pillars
grim
solid
and
spiritless
its
massive
build
a
strong
reminder
of
days
still
earlier
when
every
man
had
been
his
own
peace
officer
and
the
insurrection
of
the
blacks
a
daily
contingency
its
dark
weatherbeaten
roof
and
sides
were
hoisted
up
above
the
jungly
plain
in
a
distracted
way
like
a
gigantic
stuck
in
the
mud
and
abandoned
by
some
retreating
army
around
it
was
a
dense
growth
of
low
water
willows
with
half
a
hundred
sorts
of
thorny
or
fetid
bushes
savage
strangers
alike
to
the
language
of
flowers
and
to
the
botanist
greek
they
were
hung
with
countless
strands
of
discolored
and
prickly
smilax
and
the
impassable
mud
below
bristled
with
de
of
the
dwarf
palmetto
two
lone
dead
cypresses
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
marsh
dotted
with
roosting
vultures
the
shallow
strips
of
water
were
hid
by
myriads
of
aquatic
plants
under
whose
coarse
and
spiritless
flowers
could
one
have
seen
it
was
a
harbor
of
reptiles
great
and
small
to
make
one
shudder
to
the
end
of
his
days
the
house
was
on
a
slightly
raised
spot
the
levee
of
a
draining
canal
the
waters
of
this
canal
did
not
run
they
crawled
and
were
full
of
big
ravening
fish
and
alligators
that
held
it
against
all
comers
such
was
the
home
of
old
jean
marie
poquelin
once
an
opulent
indigo
planter
standing
high
in
the
esteem
of
his
small
proud
circle
of
exclusively
male
acquaintances
in
the
old
city
now
a
hermit
alike
shunned
by
and
shunning
all
who
had
ever
known
him
the
last
of
his
line
said
the
gossips
his
father
lies
under
the
floor
of
the
louis
cathedral
with
the
wife
of
his
youth
on
one
side
and
the
wife
of
his
old
age
on
the
other
old
jean
visits
the
spot
daily
his
alas
there
was
a
mystery
no
one
knew
what
had
become
of
the
gentle
young
half
brother
more
than
thirty
years
his
junior
whom
once
he
seemed
so
fondly
to
love
but
who
seven
years
ago
had
disappeared
suddenly
once
for
all
and
left
no
clew
of
his
fate
they
had
seemed
to
live
so
happily
in
each
other
love
no
father
mother
wife
to
either
no
kindred
upon
earth
the
elder
a
bold
frank
impetuous
chivalric
adventurer
the
younger
a
gentle
studious
recluse
they
lived
upon
the
ancestral
estate
like
mated
birds
one
always
on
the
wing
the
other
always
in
the
nest
there
was
no
trait
in
jean
marie
poquelin
said
the
old
gossips
for
which
he
was
so
well
known
among
his
few
friends
as
his
apparent
fondness
for
his
little
brother
jacques
said
this
and
jacques
said
that
he
would
leave
this
or
that
or
any
thing
to
jacques
for
jacques
was
a
scholar
and
jacques
was
good
or
wise
or
just
or
as
the
nature
of
the
case
required
and
he
should
ask
jacques
as
soon
as
he
got
home
since
jacques
was
never
elsewhere
to
be
seen
it
was
between
the
roving
character
of
the
one
brother
and
the
bookishness
of
the
other
that
the
estate
fell
into
decay
jean
marie
generous
gentleman
gambled
the
slaves
away
one
by
one
until
none
was
left
man
or
woman
but
one
old
african
mute
the
and
vats
of
louisiana
had
been
generally
abandoned
as
unremunerative
certain
enterprising
men
had
substituted
the
culture
of
sugar
but
while
the
recluse
was
too
apathetic
to
take
so
active
a
course
the
other
saw
larger
and
at
time
equally
respectable
profits
first
in
smuggling
and
later
in
the
african
what
harm
could
he
see
in
it
the
whole
people
said
it
was
vitally
necessary
and
to
minister
to
a
vital
public
necessity
good
enough
certainly
and
so
he
laid
up
many
a
doubloon
that
made
him
none
the
worse
in
the
public
regard
one
day
old
jean
marie
was
about
to
start
upon
a
voyage
that
was
to
be
longer
much
longer
than
any
that
he
had
yet
made
jacques
had
begged
him
hard
for
many
days
not
to
go
but
he
laughed
him
off
and
finally
said
kissing
him
no
said
jacques
i
shall
go
with
you
they
left
the
old
hulk
of
a
house
in
the
sole
care
of
the
african
mute
and
went
away
to
the
guinea
coast
together
two
years
after
old
poquelin
came
home
without
his
vessel
he
must
have
arrived
at
his
house
by
night
no
one
saw
him
come
no
one
saw
his
little
brother
rumor
whispered
that
he
too
had
returned
but
he
had
never
been
seen
again
a
dark
suspicion
fell
upon
the
old
no
matter
that
the
few
kept
the
many
reminded
of
the
tenderness
that
had
ever
marked
his
bearing
to
the
missing
man
the
many
shook
their
heads
you
know
he
has
a
quick
and
fearful
temper
and
why
does
he
cover
his
loss
with
mystery
grief
would
out
with
the
truth
but
said
the
charitable
few
look
in
his
face
see
that
expression
of
true
humanity
the
many
did
look
in
his
face
and
as
he
looked
in
theirs
he
read
the
silent
question
where
is
thy
brother
abel
the
few
were
silenced
his
former
friends
died
off
and
the
name
of
jean
marie
poquelin
became
a
symbol
of
witchery
devilish
crime
and
hideous
nursery
fictions
the
man
and
his
house
were
alike
shunned
the
snipe
and
duck
hunters
forsook
the
marsh
and
the
abandoned
the
canal
sometimes
the
hardier
boys
who
ventured
out
there
heard
a
slow
thumping
of
on
the
canal
they
would
look
at
each
other
for
a
moment
half
in
consternation
half
in
glee
then
rush
from
their
sport
in
wanton
haste
to
assail
with
their
gibes
the
unoffending
withered
old
man
who
in
rusty
attire
sat
in
the
stern
of
a
skiff
rowed
homeward
by
his
african
mute
o
poquelin
o
poquelin
it
was
not
necessary
to
utter
more
than
that
no
hint
of
wickedness
deformity
or
any
physical
or
moral
demerit
merely
the
name
and
tone
of
mockery
oh
poquelin
and
while
they
tumbled
one
over
another
in
their
needless
haste
to
fly
he
would
rise
carefully
from
his
seat
while
the
aged
mute
with
downcast
face
went
on
rowing
and
rolling
up
his
brown
fist
and
extending
it
toward
the
urchins
would
pour
forth
such
an
unholy
broadside
of
french
imprecation
and
invective
as
would
all
but
craze
them
with
delight
among
both
blacks
and
whites
the
house
was
the
object
of
a
thousand
superstitions
every
midnight
they
affirmed
the
came
out
of
the
marsh
and
ran
in
and
out
of
the
rooms
flashing
from
window
to
window
the
story
of
some
lads
whose
words
in
ordinary
statements
were
worthless
was
generally
credited
that
the
night
they
camped
in
the
woods
rather
than
pass
the
place
after
dark
they
saw
about
sunset
every
window
and
on
each
of
the
four
chimneys
an
owl
sitting
which
turned
his
head
three
times
round
and
moaned
and
laughed
with
a
human
voice
there
was
a
bottomless
well
everybody
professed
to
know
beneath
the
sill
of
the
big
front
door
under
the
rotten
veranda
whoever
set
his
foot
upon
that
threshold
disappeared
forever
in
the
depth
below
what
wonder
the
marsh
grew
as
wild
as
africa
take
all
the
faubourg
ste
marie
and
half
the
ancient
city
you
would
not
find
one
graceless
reckless
enough
to
pass
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
house
after
nightfall
the
alien
races
pouring
into
old
new
orleans
began
to
find
the
few
streets
named
for
the
bourbon
princes
too
strait
for
them
the
wheel
of
fortune
beginning
to
whirl
threw
them
off
beyond
the
ancient
corporation
lines
and
sowed
civilization
and
even
trade
upon
the
lands
of
the
graviers
and
girods
fields
became
roads
roads
streets
everywhere
the
leveller
was
peering
through
his
glass
rodsmen
were
whacking
their
way
through
and
and
the
sweating
irishmen
tossed
the
blue
clay
up
with
their
shovels
ha
that
is
all
very
well
quoth
the
fueling
the
reproach
of
an
enterprise
that
asked
neither
nor
advice
of
them
but
wait
till
they
come
yonder
to
jean
poquelin
marsh
ha
ha
ha
the
supposed
predicament
so
delighted
them
that
they
put
on
a
mock
terror
and
whirled
about
in
an
assumed
stampede
then
caught
their
clasped
hands
between
their
knees
in
excess
of
mirth
and
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
for
whether
the
mired
in
the
marsh
or
contrived
to
cut
through
old
property
either
event
would
be
joyful
meantime
a
line
of
tiny
rods
with
bits
of
white
paper
in
their
split
tops
gradually
extended
its
way
straight
through
the
haunted
ground
and
across
the
canal
diagonally
we
shall
fill
that
ditch
said
the
men
in
and
brushed
close
along
the
chained
and
padlocked
gate
of
the
haunted
mansion
ah
poquelin
those
were
not
creole
boys
to
be
stampeded
with
a
little
hard
swearing
he
went
to
the
governor
that
official
scanned
the
odd
figure
with
no
slight
interest
jean
poquelin
was
of
short
broad
frame
with
a
bronzed
leonine
face
his
brow
was
ample
and
deeply
furrowed
his
eye
large
and
black
was
bold
and
open
like
that
of
a
and
his
jaws
shut
together
with
the
firmness
of
iron
he
was
dressed
in
a
suit
of
attakapas
cottonade
and
his
shirt
unbuttoned
and
thrown
back
from
the
throat
and
bosom
showed
a
herculean
breast
hard
and
grizzled
there
was
no
fierceness
or
defiance
in
his
look
no
harsh
ungentleness
no
symptom
of
his
unlawful
life
or
violent
temper
but
rather
a
peaceful
and
peaceable
fearlessness
across
the
whole
face
not
marked
in
one
or
another
feature
but
as
it
were
laid
softly
upon
the
countenance
like
an
almost
imperceptible
veil
was
the
imprint
of
some
great
grief
a
careless
eye
might
easily
overlook
it
but
once
seen
there
it
hung
faint
but
unmistakable
the
governor
bowed
asked
the
figure
i
would
rather
talk
english

the
governor

but
the
old
man
did
not
stir
the
governor
took
a
quill
and
wrote
a
line
to
a
city
official
introducing
poquelin
and
asking
for
him
every
possible
courtesy
he
handed
it
to
him
instructing
him
where
to
present
it
poquelin
he
said
with
a
conciliatory
smile
tell
me
is
it
your
house
that
our
creole
citizens
tell
such
odd
stories
about
the
old
man
glared
sternly
upon
the
speaker
and
with
immovable
features
said
you
do
see

some
guinea
nigga
oh

dat
all
right
adieu
he
put
his
hat
on
and
withdrew
by
and
by
he
stood
letter
in
hand
before
the
person
to
whom
it
was
addressed
this
person
employed
an
interpreter
he
says
said
the
interpreter
to
the
officer
he
come
to
make
you
the
fair
warning
how
you
muz
not
make
the
street
pas
at
his
the
officer
remarked
that
such
impudence
was
refreshing
but
the
experienced
interpreter
translated
freely
he
says
you
do
want
said
the
interpreter
the
old
answered
at
some
length
he
says
said
the
interpreter
again
turning
to
the
officer
the
marass
is
a
too
unhealth
for
peopl
to
live
but
we
expect
to
drain
his
old
marsh
it
not
going
to
be
a
marsh
the
interpreter
explained
in
french
the
old
man
answered
tersely
he
says
the
canal
is
a
private
said
the
interpreter
oh
old
ditch
that
to
be
filled
up
tell
the
old
man
going
to
fix
him
up
nicely
translation
being
duly
made
the
man
in
power
was
amused
to
see
a
gathering
on
the
old
man
face
tell
him
he
added
by
the
time
we
finish
there
not
be
a
ghost
left
in
his
shanty
the
interpreter
began
to
translate
but
comprends
j
said
the
old
man
with
an
impatient
gesture
and
burst
forth
pouring
curses
upon
the
united
states
the
president
the
territory
of
orleans
congress
the
governor
and
all
his
subordinates
striding
out
of
the
apartment
as
he
cursed
while
the
object
of
his
maledictions
roared
with
merriment
and
rammed
the
floor
with
his
foot
why
it
will
make
his
old
place
worth
ten
dollars
to
one
said
the
official
to
the
interpreter
is
not
for
de
worse
of
de
property
said
the
interpreter
i
should
guess
not
said
the
other
whittling
his
chair
seems
to
me
as
if
some
of
these
old
creoles
would
liever
live
in
a
crawfish
hole
than
to
have
a
neighbor
you
know
what
make
old
jean
poquelin
make
like
that
i
will
tell
you
you
know
the
interpreter
was
rolling
a
cigarette
and
paused
to
light
his
tinder
then
as
the
smoke
poured
in
a
thick
double
stream
from
his
nostrils
he
said
in
a
solemn
whisper
he
is
a
witch
ho
ho
ho
laughed
the
other
you
do
believe
it
what
you
want
to
bet
cried
the
interpreter
jerking
himself
half
up
and
thrusting
out
one
arm
while
he
bared
it
of
its
with
the
hand
of
the
other
what
you
want
to
bet
how
do
you
know
asked
the
official
dass
what
i
goin
to
tell
you
you
know
one
evening
i
was
shooting
some
i
killed
three
but
i
had
trouble
to
fine
them
it
was
becoming
so
dark
when
i
have
them
i
start
to
come
home
then
i
got
to
pas
at
jean
poquelin
house
ho
ho
ho
laughed
the
other
throwing
his
leg
over
the
arm
of
his
chair
wait
said
the
interpreter
i
come
along
slow
not
making
some
noises
still
still
and
scared
said
the
smiling
one
wait
i
get
all
pas
the
i
say
right
then
i
see
two
thing
before
hah
i
get
as
cold
and
humide
and
shake
like
a
leaf
you
think
it
was
nothing
there
i
see
so
plain
as
can
be
though
it
was
making
nearly
dark
i
see
jean
marie
walkin
right
in
front
and
right
there
beside
of
him
was
something
like
a
man
but
not
a
man
white
like
paint
i
dropp
on
the
grass
from
scared
they
pass
so
sure
as
i
live
was
the
ghos
of
jacques
poquelin
his
brother
pooh
said
the
listener
i
put
my
han
in
the
fire
said
the
interpreter
but
did
you
never
think
asked
the
other
that
that
might
be
jack
poquelin
as
you
call
him
alive
and
well
and
for
some
cause
hid
away
by
his
brother
but
there
har
no
cause
said
the
other
and
the
entrance
of
third
parties
changed
the
subject
some
months
passed
and
the
street
was
opened
a
canal
was
first
dug
through
the
marsh
the
small
one
which
passed
so
close
to
jean
poquelin
house
was
filled
and
the
street
or
rather
a
sunny
road
just
touched
a
corner
of
the
old
mansion
dooryard
the
morass
ran
dry
its
venomous
denizens
slipped
away
through
the
bulrushes
the
cattle
roaming
freely
upon
its
hardened
surface
trampled
the
superabundant
undergrowth
the
bellowing
frogs
croaked
to
westward
lilies
and
the
sprang
up
in
the
place
of
reeds
smilax
and
gave
way
to
the
and
pink
spiderwort
the
bindweeds
ran
everywhere
blooming
as
they
ran
and
on
one
of
the
dead
cypresses
a
giant
creeper
hung
its
green
burden
of
foliage
and
lifted
its
scarlet
trumpets
sparrows
and
flitted
through
the
bushes
and
dewberries
grew
ripe
beneath
over
all
these
came
a
sweet
dry
smell
of
salubrity
which
the
place
had
not
known
since
the
sediments
of
the
mississippi
first
lifted
it
from
the
sea
but
its
owner
did
not
build
over
the
and
down
the
vista
of
the
open
street
bright
new
houses
some
singly
some
by
ranks
were
prying
in
upon
the
old
man
privacy
they
even
settled
down
toward
his
southern
side
first
a
hut
or
two
then
a
market
gardener
shanty
then
a
painted
cottage
and
all
at
once
the
faubourg
had
flanked
and
half
surrounded
him
and
his
marsh
ah
then
the
common
people
began
to
hate
him
the
old
tyrant
you
do
mean
an
old
well
then
why
do
he
build
when
the
public
need
demands
it
what
does
he
live
in
that
unneighborly
way
for
the
old
pirate
the
old
kidnapper
how
easily
even
the
most
ultra
louisianians
put
on
the
imported
virtues
of
the
north
when
they
could
be
brought
to
bear
against
the
hermit
there
he
goes
with
the
boys
after
him
ah
ha
ha
poquelin
ah
aha
aha
marie
poquelin
the
old
villain
how
merrily
the
swarming
américains
echo
the
spirit
of
persecution
the
old
fraud
they
say
pretends
to
live
in
a
haunted
house
does
he
we
tar
and
feather
him
some
day
guess
we
can
fix
him
he
can
not
be
rowed
home
along
the
old
canal
now
he
walks
he
has
broken
sadly
of
late
and
the
street
urchins
are
ever
at
his
heels
it
is
like
the
days
when
they
cried
go
up
thou
and
the
old
man
now
and
then
turns
and
delivers
ineffectual
curses
to
the
creoles
to
the
incoming
lower
class
of
superstitious
germans
irish
sicilians
and
others
he
became
an
omen
and
embodiment
of
public
and
private
upon
him
all
the
vagaries
of
their
superstitions
gathered
and
grew
if
a
house
caught
fire
it
was
imputed
to
his
machinations
did
a
woman
go
off
in
a
fit
he
had
bewitched
her
did
a
child
stray
off
for
an
hour
the
mother
shivered
with
the
apprehension
that
jean
poquelin
had
offered
him
to
strange
gods
the
house
was
the
subject
of
every
bad
boy
invention
who
loved
to
contrive
ghostly
lies
as
long
as
that
house
stands
we
shall
have
bad
luck
do
you
not
see
our
pease
and
beans
dying
our
cabbages
and
lettuce
going
to
seed
and
our
gardens
turning
to
dust
while
every
day
you
can
see
it
raining
in
the
woods
the
rain
will
never
pass
old
poquelin
house
he
keeps
a
fetich
he
has
conjured
the
whole
faubourg
marie
and
why
the
old
wretch
simply
because
our
playful
and
innocent
children
call
after
him
as
he
passes
a
building
and
improvement
company
which
had
not
yet
got
its
charter
but
was
going
to
and
which
had
not
indeed
any
tangible
capital
yet
but
was
going
to
have
some
joined
the
poquelin
war
the
haunted
property
would
be
such
a
capital
site
for
a
they
sent
a
deputation
to
the
old
mansion
to
ask
its
occupant
to
sell
the
deputation
never
got
beyond
the
chained
gate
and
a
very
barren
interview
with
the
african
mute
the
president
of
the
board
was
then
empowered
for
he
had
studied
french
in
pennsylvania
and
was
considered
qualified
to
call
and
persuade
poquelin
to
subscribe
to
the
company
stock
but
fact
is
gentlemen
he
said
at
the
next
meeting
it
would
take
us
at
least
twelve
months
to
make
pokaleen
understand
the
rather
original
features
of
our
system
and
he
would
subscribe
when
we
done
besides
the
only
way
to
see
him
is
to
stop
him
on
the
street
there
was
a
great
laugh
from
the
board
they
could
help
it
better
meet
a
bear
robbed
of
her
whelps
said
one
you
mistaken
as
to
that
said
the
president
i
did
meet
him
and
stopped
him
and
found
him
quite
polite
but
i
could
get
no
satisfaction
from
him
the
fellow
would
talk
in
french
and
when
i
spoke
in
english
he
hoisted
his
old
shoulders
up
and
gave
the
same
answer
to
every
thing
i
said
and
that
was
asked
one
or
two
impatient
of
the
pause
that
it
worse
one
of
the
board
said
president
this
project
as
i
take
it
is
not
altogether
a
selfish
one
the
community
is
to
be
benefited
by
it
we
may
feel
that
we
are
working
in
the
public
interest
the
board
smiled
knowingly
if
we
employ
all
possible
means
to
oust
this
old
nuisance
from
among
us
you
may
know
that
at
the
time
the
street
was
cut
through
this
old
poquelann
did
all
he
could
to
prevent
it
it
was
owing
to
a
certain
connection
which
i
had
with
that
affair
that
i
heard
a
ghost
story
smiles
followed
by
a
sudden
dignified
check
ghost
story
which
of
course
i
am
not
going
to
relate
but
i
say
that
my
profound
conviction
arising
from
a
prolonged
study
of
that
story
is
that
this
old
villain
john
poquelann
has
his
brother
locked
up
in
that
old
house
now
if
this
is
so
and
we
can
fix
it
on
him
i
merely
that
we
can
make
the
matter
highly
useful
i
do
know
he
added
beginning
to
sit
down
but
that
it
is
an
action
we
owe
to
the
community
hem
how
do
you
propose
to
handle
the
subject
asked
the
president
i
was
thinking
said
the
speaker
that
as
a
board
of
directors
it
would
be
unadvisable
for
us
to
authorize
any
action
involving
trespass
but
if
you
for
instance
president
should
as
it
were
for
mere
curiosity
some
one
as
for
instance
our
excellent
secretary
simply
as
a
personal
favor
to
look
into
the
matter
this
is
merely
a
suggestion
the
secretary
smiled
sufficiently
to
be
understood
that
while
he
certainly
did
not
consider
such
preposterous
service
a
part
of
his
duties
as
secretary
he
might
notwithstanding
accede
to
the
president
request
and
the
board
adjourned
little
white
as
the
secretary
was
called
was
a
mild
little
man
who
nevertheless
had
no
fear
of
any
thing
unless
it
was
the
fear
of
being
unkind
i
tell
you
frankly
he
privately
said
to
the
president
i
go
into
this
purely
for
reasons
of
my
own
the
next
day
a
little
after
nightfall
one
might
have
descried
this
little
man
slipping
along
the
rear
fence
of
the
poquelin
place
preparatory
to
vaulting
over
into
the
rank
yard
and
bearing
himself
altogether
more
after
the
manner
of
a
collector
of
rare
chickens
than
according
to
the
usage
of
secretaries
the
picture
presented
to
his
eye
was
not
calculated
to
enliven
his
mind
the
old
mansion
stood
out
against
the
western
sky
black
and
silent
one
long
lurid
along
a
sky
of
slate
was
all
that
was
left
of
daylight
no
sign
of
life
was
apparent
no
light
at
any
window
unless
it
might
have
been
on
the
side
of
the
house
hidden
from
view
no
owls
were
on
the
chimneys
no
dogs
were
in
the
yard
he
entered
the
place
and
ventured
up
behind
a
small
cabin
which
stood
apart
from
the
house
through
one
of
its
many
crannies
he
easily
detected
the
african
mute
crouched
before
a
flickering
his
head
on
his
knees
fast
asleep
he
concluded
to
enter
the
mansion
and
with
that
view
stood
and
scanned
it
the
broad
rear
steps
of
the
veranda
would
not
serve
him
he
might
meet
some
one
midway
he
was
measuring
with
his
eye
the
proportions
of
one
of
the
pillars
which
supported
it
and
estimating
the
practicability
of
climbing
it
when
he
heard
a
footstep
some
one
dragged
a
chair
out
toward
the
railing
then
seemed
to
change
his
mind
and
began
to
pace
the
veranda
his
footfalls
resounding
on
the
dry
boards
with
singular
loudness
little
white
drew
a
step
backward
got
the
figure
between
himself
and
the
sky
and
at
once
recognized
the
short
form
of
old
jean
poquelin
he
sat
down
upon
a
billet
of
wood
and
to
escape
the
stings
of
a
whining
cloud
of
mosquitoes
shrouded
his
face
and
neck
in
his
handkerchief
leaving
his
eyes
uncovered
he
had
sat
there
but
a
moment
when
he
noticed
a
strange
sickening
odor
faint
as
if
coming
from
a
distance
but
loathsome
and
horrid
whence
could
it
come
not
from
the
cabin
not
from
the
marsh
for
it
was
as
dry
as
powder
it
was
not
in
the
air
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
ground
rising
up
he
noticed
for
the
first
time
a
few
steps
before
him
a
narrow
footpath
leading
toward
the
house
he
glanced
down
it
ha
right
there
was
some
one
coming
ghostly
white
quick
as
thought
and
as
noiselessly
he
lay
down
at
full
length
against
the
cabin
it
was
bold
strategy
and
yet
there
was
no
denying
it
little
white
felt
that
he
was
frightened
it
is
not
a
ghost
he
said
to
himself
i
it
can
not
be
a
ghost
but
the
perspiration
burst
out
at
every
pore
and
the
air
seemed
to
thicken
with
heat
it
is
a
living
man
he
said
in
his
thoughts
i
hear
his
footstep
and
i
hear
old
poquelin
footsteps
too
separately
over
on
the
veranda
i
am
not
discovered
the
thing
has
passed
there
is
that
odor
again
what
a
smell
of
death
is
it
coming
back
yes
it
stops
at
the
door
of
the
cabin
is
it
peering
in
at
the
sleeping
mute
it
moves
away
it
is
in
the
path
again
now
it
is
gone
he
shuddered
now
if
i
dare
venture
the
mystery
is
solved
he
rose
cautiously
close
against
the
cabin
and
peered
along
the
path
the
figure
of
a
man
a
presence
if
not
a
body
but
whether
clad
in
some
white
stuff
or
naked
the
darkness
would
not
allow
him
to
determine
had
turned
and
now
with
a
seeming
painful
gait
moved
slowly
from
him
great
heaven
can
it
be
that
the
dead
do
walk
he
withdrew
again
the
hands
which
had
gone
to
his
eyes
the
dreadful
object
passed
between
two
pillars
and
under
the
house
he
listened
there
was
a
faint
sound
as
of
feet
upon
a
staircase
then
all
was
still
except
the
measured
tread
of
jean
poquelin
walking
on
the
veranda
and
the
heavy
respirations
of
the
mute
slumbering
in
the
cabin
the
little
secretary
was
about
to
retreat
but
as
he
looked
once
more
toward
the
haunted
louse
a
dim
light
appeared
in
the
crack
of
a
closed
window
and
presently
old
jean
poquelin
came
dragging
his
chair
and
sat
down
close
against
the
shining
cranny
he
spoke
in
a
low
tender
tone
in
the
french
tongue
making
some
inquiry
an
answer
came
from
within
was
it
the
voice
of
a
human
so
unnatural
was
it
so
hollow
so
discordant
so
unearthly
that
the
stealthy
listener
shuddered
again
from
head
to
foot
and
when
something
stirred
in
some
bushes
near
by
though
it
may
have
been
nothing
more
than
a
rat
and
came
scuttling
through
the
grass
the
little
secretary
actually
turned
and
fled
as
he
left
the
enclosure
he
moved
with
bolder
leisure
through
the
bushes
yet
now
and
then
he
spoke
aloud
oh
oh
i
see
i
understand
and
shut
his
eyes
in
his
hands
how
strange
that
henceforth
little
white
was
the
champion
of
jean
poquelin
in
season
and
out
of
season
wherever
a
word
was
uttered
against
him
the
secretary
with
a
quiet
aggressive
force
that
instantly
arrested
gossip
demanded
upon
what
authority
the
statement
or
conjecture
was
made
but
as
he
did
not
condescend
to
explain
his
own
remarkable
attitude
it
was
not
long
before
the
disrelish
and
suspicion
which
had
followed
jean
poquelin
so
many
years
fell
also
upon
him
it
was
only
the
next
evening
but
one
after
his
adventure
that
he
made
himself
a
source
of
sullen
amazement
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
boys
by
ordering
them
to
desist
from
their
wanton
hallooing
old
jean
poquelin
standing
and
shaking
his
cane
rolling
out
his
maledictions
paused
and
stared
then
gave
the
secretary
a
courteous
bow
and
started
on
the
boys
save
one
from
pure
astonishment
ceased
but
a
ruffianly
little
irish
lad
more
daring
than
any
had
yet
been
threw
a
big
hurtling
clod
that
struck
old
poquelin
between
the
shoulders
and
burst
like
a
shell
the
enraged
old
man
wheeled
with
uplifted
staff
to
give
chase
to
the
scampering
vagabond
and
he
may
have
tripped
or
he
may
not
but
he
fell
full
length
little
white
hastened
to
help
him
up
but
he
waved
him
off
with
a
fierce
imprecation
and
staggering
to
his
feet
resumed
his
way
homeward
his
lips
were
reddened
with
blood
little
white
was
on
his
way
to
the
meeting
of
the
board
he
would
have
given
all
he
dared
spend
to
have
staid
away
for
he
felt
both
too
fierce
and
too
tremulous
to
brook
the
criticisms
that
were
likely
to
be
made
i
ca
help
it
gentlemen
i
ca
help
you
to
make
a
case
against
the
old
man
and
i
not
going
to
we
did
not
expect
this
disappointment
mr
white
i
ca
help
that
sir
no
sir
you
had
better
not
appoint
any
more
investigations
somebody
investigate
himself
into
trouble
no
sir
it
is
a
threat
it
is
only
my
advice
but
i
warn
you
that
whoever
takes
the
task
in
hand
will
rue
it
to
his
dying
day
which
may
be
hastened
too
the
president
expressed
himself
surprised
i
do
care
a
rush
answered
little
white
wildly
and
foolishly
i
do
care
a
rush
if
you
are
sir
no
my
nerves
are
not
disordered
my
head
as
clear
as
a
bell
no
i
excited
a
director
remarked
that
the
secretary
looked
as
though
he
had
waked
from
a
nightmare
well
sir
if
you
want
to
know
the
fact
i
have
and
if
you
choose
to
cultivate
old
poquelin
society
you
can
have
one
too
white
called
a
facetious
member
but
white
did
not
notice
white
he
called
again
what
demanded
white
with
a
scowl
did
you
see
the
ghost
yes
sir
i
did
cried
white
hitting
the
table
and
handing
the
president
a
paper
which
brought
the
board
to
other
business
the
story
got
among
the
gossips
that
somebody
they
were
afraid
to
say
little
white
had
been
to
the
poquelin
mansion
by
night
and
beheld
something
appalling
the
rumor
was
but
a
shadow
of
the
truth
magnified
and
distorted
as
is
the
manner
of
shadows
he
had
seen
skeletons
walking
and
had
barely
escaped
the
clutches
of
one
by
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
some
madcap
boys
with
an
appetite
for
the
horrible
plucked
up
courage
to
venture
through
the
dried
marsh
by
the
and
come
before
the
house
at
a
spectral
hour
when
the
air
was
full
of
bats
something
which
they
but
half
saw
half
a
sight
was
enough
sent
them
tearing
back
through
the
and
acacia
bushes
to
their
homes
where
they
fairly
dropped
down
and
cried
was
it
white
no
yes
nearly
so
we
ca
tell
but
we
saw
it
and
one
could
hardly
doubt
to
look
at
their
ashen
faces
that
they
had
whatever
it
was
if
that
old
rascal
lived
in
the
country
we
come
from
said
certain
américains
he
have
been
tarred
and
feathered
before
now
he
sanders
well
now
he
just
would
and
we
have
rid
him
on
a
rail
would
we
that
what
i
allow
tell
you
what
you
do
they
were
talking
to
some
rollicking
creoles
who
had
assumed
an
absolute
necessity
for
doing
what
is
it
you
call
this
thing
where
an
old
man
marries
a
young
girl
and
you
come
out
with
horns
and
asked
the
creoles
yes
that
it
why
do
you
shivaree
him
felicitous
suggestion
little
white
with
his
wife
beside
him
was
sitting
on
their
doorsteps
on
the
sidewalk
as
creole
custom
had
taught
them
looking
toward
the
sunset
they
had
moved
into
the
street
the
view
was
not
attractive
on
the
score
of
beauty
the
houses
were
small
and
scattered
and
across
the
flat
commons
spite
of
the
lofty
tangle
of
weeds
and
bushes
and
spite
of
the
thickets
of
acacia
they
needs
must
see
the
dismal
old
poquelin
mansion
tilted
awry
and
shutting
out
the
declining
sun
the
moon
white
and
slender
was
hanging
the
tip
of
its
horn
over
one
of
the
chimneys
and
you
say
said
the
secretary
the
old
black
man
has
been
going
by
here
alone
patty
suppose
old
poquelin
should
be
concocting
some
mischief
he
do
lack
provocation
the
way
that
clod
hit
him
the
other
day
was
enough
to
have
killed
him
why
patty
he
dropped
as
quick
as
no
wonder
you
have
seen
him
i
wonder
if
they
have
heard
something
about
him
up
at
the
suppose
i
go
and
see
do
said
his
wife
she
sat
alone
for
half
an
hour
watching
that
sudden
going
out
of
the
day
peculiar
to
the
latitude
that
moon
is
ghost
enough
for
one
house
she
said
as
her
husband
returned
it
has
gone
right
down
the
chimney
patty
said
little
white
the
says
the
boys
are
going
to
shivaree
old
poquelin

going
to
try
to

his
wife

going
to
sit
out
here
until
they

along
they
compelled
to
pass
right
by
here
why
white
it
may
be
midnight
before
they
start
you
not
going
to
sit
out
here
till
then
yes
i
am
well
you
very
foolish
said
white
in
an
undertone
looking
anxious
and
tapping
one
of
the
steps
with
her
foot
they
sat
a
very
long
time
talking
over
little
family
matters
what
that
at
last
said
white
that
the
gun
said
white
and
they
relapsed
into
a
drowsy
silence
patty
you
better
go
in
and
go
to
bed
said
he
at
last
i
not
sleepy
well
you
very
foolish
quietly
remarked
little
white
and
again
silence
fell
upon
them
patty
suppose
i
walk
out
to
the
old
house
and
see
if
i
can
find
out
any
thing
suppose
said
she
you
do
do
any
such
listen
down
the
street
arose
a
great
hubbub
dogs
and
boys
were
howling
and
barking
men
were
laughing
shouting
groaning
and
blowing
horns
whooping
and
clanking
whinnying
and
howling
and
rattling
pots
and
pans
they
are
coming
this
way
said
little
white
you
had
better
go
into
the

no
i
going
to
see
if
i
ca
stop
them
why
white
i
be
back
in
a
minute
said
white
and
went
toward
the
noise
in
a
few
moments
the
little
secretary
met
the
mob
the
pen
hesitates
on
the
word
for
there
is
a
respectable
difference
measurable
only
on
the
scale
of
the
half
century
between
a
mob
and
a
little
white
lifted
his
ineffectual
voice
he
faced
the
head
of
the
disorderly
column
and
cast
himself
about
as
if
he
were
made
of
wood
and
moved
by
the
jerk
of
a
string
he
rushed
to
one
who
seemed
from
the
size
and
clatter
of
his
tin
pan
to
be
a
leader
these
fellows
bienvenu
stop
them
just
a
minute
till
i
tell
them
bienvenu
turned
and
brandished
his
instruments
of
discord
in
an
imploring
way
to
the
crowd
they
slackened
their
pace
two
or
three
hushed
their
horns
and
joined
the
prayer
of
little
white
and
bienvenu
for
silence
the
throng
halted
the
hush
was
delicious
bienvenu
said
little
white

gaped
again
they
were
off
at
a
right
angle
nodding
white
looked
at
the
well
if
it
is
away
after
midnight
the
hideous
noise
down
street
was
passing
beyond
earshot
she
raised
a
sash
and
listened
for
a
moment
there
was
silence

dollars
to

hospital
before
they
stop
the
couple
retired
and
white
slumbered
she
was
awakened
by
her
husband
snapping
the
lid
of
his
watch
what
time
she
asked
three

her

two
or
three
hundred
men
and
boys
pass
the
place
at
a
rapid
walk
straight
down
the
broad
new
street
toward
the
hated
house
of
ghosts
the
din
was
terrific
she
saw
little
white
at
the
head
of
the
rabble
brandishing
his
arms
and
trying
in
vain
to
make
himself
heard
but
they
only
shook
their
heads
laughing
and
hooting
the
louder
and
so
passed
bearing
him
on
before
them
swiftly
they
pass
out
from
among
the
houses
away
from
the
dim
oil
lamps
of
the
street
out
into
the
broad
starlit
commons
and
enter
the
willowy
jungles
of
the
haunted
ground
some
hearts
fail
and
their
owners
lag
behind
and
turn
back
suddenly
remembering
how
near
morning
it
is
but
the
most
part
push
on
tearing
the
air
with
their
clamor
down
ahead
of
them
in
the
long
way
there
is
singularly
enough
a
faint
dancing
light
it
must
be
very
near
the
old
house
it
is
it
has
stopped
now
it
is
a
lantern
and
is
under
a
sapling
which
has
grown
up
on
the
wayside
since
the
canal
was
filled
now
it
swings
mysteriously
to
and
fro
a
goodly
number
of
the
more
give
up
the
sport
but
a
full
hundred
move
forward
at
a
run
doubling
their
devilish
howling
and
banging
yes
it
is
a
lantern
and
there
are
two
persons
under
the
tree
the
crowd
draws
near
drops
into
a
walk
one
of
the
two
is
the
old
african
mute
he
lifts
the
lantern
up
so
that
it
shines
on
the
other
the
crowd
recoils
there
is
a
hush
of
all
clangor
and
all
at
once
with
a
cry
of
mingled
fright
and
horror
from
every
throat
the
whole
throng
rushes
back
dropping
every
thing
sweeping
past
little
white
and
hurrying
on
never
stopping
until
the
jungle
is
left
behind
and
then
to
find
that
not
one
in
ten
has
seen
the
cause
of
the
stampede
and
not
one
of
the
tenth
is
certain
what
it
was
there
is
one
huge
fellow
among
them
who
looks
capable
of
any
villany
he
finds
something
to
mount
on
and
in
the
creole
calls
a
general
halt
bienvenu
sinks
down
and
vainly
trying
to
recline
gracefully
resigns
the
leadership
the
herd
gather
round
the
speaker
he
assures
them
that
they
have
been
outraged
their
right
peaceably
to
traverse
the
public
streets
has
been
trampled
upon
shall
such
encroachments
be
endured
it
is
now
daybreak
let
them
go
now
by
the
open
light
of
day
and
force
a
free
passage
of
the
public
highway
a
scattering
consent
was
the
response
and
the
crowd
thinned
now
and
drowsy
straggled
quietly
down
toward
the
old
house
some
drifted
ahead
others
sauntered
behind
but
every
one
as
he
again
neared
the
tree
came
to
a
little
white
sat
upon
a
bank
of
turf
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
looking
very
stern
and
sad
to
each
he
put
the
same
question
did
you
come
here
to
go
to
old
poquelin
yes
he
dead
and
if
the
shocked
hearer
started
away
he
would
say
go
away
why
not
i
want
you
to
go
to
the
funeral
presently
if
some
louisianian
too
loyal
to
dear
france
or
spain
to
understand
english
looked
bewildered
some
one
would
interpret
for
him
and
presently
they
went
little
white
led
the
van
the
crowd
trooping
after
him
down
the
middle
of
the
way
the
gate
that
had
never
been
seen
before
unchained
was
open
stern
little
white
stopped
a
short
distance
from
it
the
rabble
stopped
behind
him
something
was
moving
out
from
under
the
veranda
the
many
whisperers
stretched
upward
to
see
the
african
mute
came
very
slowly
toward
the
gate
leading
by
a
cord
in
the
nose
a
small
brown
bull
which
was
harnessed
to
a
rude
cart
on
the
flat
body
of
the
cart
under
a
black
cloth
were
seen
the
outlines
of
a
long
box
hats
off
gentlemen
said
little
white
as
the
box
came
in
view
and
the
crowd
silently
uncovered
gentlemen
said
little
white
here
come
the
last
remains
of
jean
marie
poquelin
a
better
man
i
afraid
with
all
his
sins
yes
a
better
a
kinder
man
to
his
blood
a
man
of
more
goodness
than
all
of
you
put
together
will
ever
dare
to
be
there
was
a
profound
hush
as
the
vehicle
came
creaking
through
the
gate
but
when
it
turned
away
from
them
toward
the
forest
those
in
front
started
suddenly
there
was
a
backward
rush
then
all
stood
still
again
staring
one
way
for
there
behind
the
bier
with
eyes
cast
down
and
labored
step
walked
the
living
remains
all
that
was
left
of
little
jacques
poquelin
the
brother
a
leper
as
white
as
snow
dumb
with
horror
the
cringing
crowd
gazed
upon
the
walking
death
they
watched
in
silent
awe
the
slow
creep
down
the
long
straight
road
and
lessen
on
the
view
until
by
and
by
it
stopped
where
a
wild
unfrequented
path
branched
off
into
the
undergrowth
toward
the
rear
of
the
ancient
city
they
are
going
to
the
aux
said
one
in
the
crowd
the
rest
watched
them
in
silence
the
little
bull
was
set
free
the
mute
with
the
strength
of
an
ape
lifted
the
long
box
to
his
shoulder
for
a
moment
more
the
mute
and
the
leper
stood
in
sight
while
the
former
adjusted
his
heavy
burden
then
without
one
backward
glance
upon
the
unkind
human
world
turning
their
faces
toward
the
ridge
in
the
depths
of
the
swamp
known
as
the
land
they
stepped
into
the
jungle
disappeared
and
were
never
seen
again
tite
poulette
kristian
koppig
was
a
beardless
young
dutchman
he
was
one
of
that
army
of
gentlemen
who
after
the
purchase
of
louisiana
swarmed
from
all
parts
of
the
commercial
world
over
the
mountains
of
exclusiveness
like
the
goths
over
the
pyrenees
and
settled
down
in
new
orleans
to
pick
up
their
fortunes
with
the
diligence
of
hungry
pigeons
he
may
have
been
a
german
the
distinction
was
too
fine
for
creole
haste
and
disrelish
he
made
his
home
in
a
room
with
one
dormer
window
looking
out
and
somewhat
down
upon
a
building
opposite
which
still
stands
flush
with
the
street
a
century
old
its
big
windows
in
a
long
row
are
walled
up
and
two
or
three
from
time
to
time
have
had
smaller
windows
let
into
them
again
with
odd
little
latticed
in
their
batten
shutters
this
had
already
been
done
when
kristian
koppig
first
began
to
look
at
them
from
his
solitary
dormer
window
all
the
features
of
the
building
lead
me
to
guess
that
it
is
a
remnant
of
the
old
spanish
barracks
whose
extensive
structure
fell
by
government
sale
into
private
hands
a
long
time
ago
at
the
end
toward
the
swamp
a
great
passage
is
left
with
an
arched
entrance
and
a
pair
of
ponderous
wooden
doors
you
look
at
it
and
almost
see
count
artillery
come
bumping
and
trundling
out
and
dash
around
into
the
ancient
plaza
to
bang
away
at
king
charles
birthday
i
do
not
know
who
lives
there
now
you
might
stand
about
on
the
opposite
for
weeks
and
never
find
out
i
suppose
it
is
a
residence
for
it
does
not
look
like
one
that
is
the
rule
in
that
region
in
the
good
old
times
of
duels
and
and
and
cayetano
circus
kristian
koppig
rooming
as
described
there
lived
in
the
portion
of
this
house
partly
overhanging
the
archway
a
palish
handsome
woman
by
the
name
or
going
by
the
name
of
madame
john
you
would
hardly
have
thought
of
her
being
colored
though
fading
she
was
still
of
very
attractive
countenance
fine
rather
severe
features
nearly
straight
hair
carefully
kept
and
that
vivid
black
eye
so
peculiar
to
her
kind
her
smile
which
came
and
went
with
her
talk
was
sweet
and
exceedingly
intelligent
and
something
told
you
as
you
looked
at
her
that
she
was
one
who
had
had
to
learn
a
great
deal
in
this
troublesome
life
but
the
creole
lads
in
the
street
would
say
her
daughter
and
there
would
be
lifting
of
arms
wringing
of
fingers
rolling
of
eyes
rounding
of
mouths
gaspings
and
clasping
of
hands
so
beautiful
beautiful
beautiful
white
white
like
a
water
lily
white
like
a
magnolia
applause
would
follow
and
invocation
of
all
the
saints
to
witness
and
she
could
sing
sing
disdainfully
if
a
can
ha
they
could
not
tell
just
how
old
she
was
they
would
give
her
about
seventeen
mother
and
daughter
were
very
fond
the
neighbors
could
hear
them
call
each
other
pet
names
and
see
them
sitting
together
sewing
talking
happily
to
each
other
in
the
unceasing
french
way
and
see
them
go
out
and
come
in
together
on
their
little
tasks
and
errands
poulette
the
daughter
was
called
she
never
went
out
alone
and
who
was
this
madame
john
why
you
know
she
was
said
the
at
the
corner
to
kristian
koppig
i
tell
you
you
know
she
was
and
the
rest
atomized
off
in
a
rasping
whisper
she
was
the
best
nurse
in
a
thousand
yards
round
but
that
is
not
what
the
said
a
block
nearer
the
river
stands
a
house
altogether
different
from
the
remnant
of
old
barracks
it
is
of
frame
with
a
deep
front
gallery
over
which
the
roof
extends
it
has
become
a
den
of
italians
who
sell
fuel
by
daylight
and
by
night
are
up
to
no
telling
what
extent
of
deviltry
this
was
once
the
home
of
a
gay
gentleman
whose
first
name
happened
to
be
john
he
was
a
member
of
the
good
children
social
club
as
his
parents
lived
with
him
his
wife
would
according
to
custom
have
been
called
madame
john
but
he
had
no
wife
his
father
died
then
his
mother
last
of
all
himself
as
he
is
about
to
be
off
in
comes
madame
john
with
poulette
then
an
infant
on
her
arm
zalli
said
he
i
am
going
she
bowed
her
head
and
wept
you
have
been
very
faithful
to
me
zalli
she
wept
on
nobody
to
take
care
of
you
now
zalli
zalli
only
went
on
weeping
i
want
to
give
you
this
house
zalli
it
is
for
you
and
the
little
one
an
hour
after
amid
the
sobs
of
madame
john
she
and
the
little
one
inherited
the
house
such
as
it
was
with
the
fatal
caution
which
characterizes
ignorance
she
sold
the
property
and
placed
the
proceeds
in
a
bank
which
made
haste
to
fail
she
put
on
widow
weeds
and
wore
them
still
when
poulette
had
seventeen
as
the
frantic
lads
would
say
how
they
did
chatter
over
her
quiet
kristian
koppig
had
never
seen
the
like
he
wrote
to
his
mother
and
told
her
so
a
pretty
fellow
at
the
corner
would
suddenly
double
himself
up
with
beckoning
to
a
knot
of
chums
these
would
hasten
up
recruits
would
come
in
from
two
or
three
other
directions
as
they
reached
the
corner
their
countenances
would
quickly
assume
a
genteel
severity
and
presently
with
her
mother
poulette
would
pass
tall
straight
lithe
her
great
black
eyes
made
tender
by
their
sweeping
lashes
the
faintest
tint
of
color
in
her
southern
cheek
her
form
all
grace
her
carriage
a
wonder
of
simple
dignity
the
instant
she
was
gone
every
tongue
was
let
slip
on
the
marvel
of
her
beauty
but
though
theirs
were
only
the
loose
new
orleans
morals
of
over
fifty
years
ago
their
unleashed
tongues
never
had
attempted
any
greater
liberty
than
to
take
up
the
pet
name
poulette
and
yet
the
mother
was
soon
to
be
as
we
shall
discover
a
paid
dancer
at
the
de
to
zalli
of
course
as
to
all
quadroon
ladies
the
festivities
of
the
were
familiar
of
old
there
in
the
happy
days
when
dear
monsieur
john
was
young
and
the
eighteenth
century
old
she
had
often
repaired
under
guard
of
her
mother
dead
now
alas
and
monsieur
john
would
slip
away
from
the
dull
play
and
dry
society
of
théâtre
and
come
around
with
his
crowd
of
elegant
friends
and
through
the
long
sweet
hours
of
the
ball
she
had
danced
and
laughed
and
coquetted
under
her
satin
mask
even
to
the
baffling
and
tormenting
of
that
prince
of
gentlemen
dear
monsieur
john
himself
no
man
of
questionable
blood
dare
set
his
foot
within
the
door
many
noble
gentlemen
were
pleased
to
dance
with
her
colonel
de
and
general
la
city
councilmen
and
officers
from
the
government
house
there
were
no
paid
dancers
then
every
thing
was
decorously
conducted
indeed
every
girl
mother
was
there
and
the
more
discreet
always
left
before
there
was
too
much
drinking
yes
it
was
gay
gay
but
sometimes
dangerous
ha
more
times
than
a
few
had
monsieur
john
knocked
down
some
and
rowdy
and
kicked
the
breath
out
of
him
for
looking
saucily
at
her
but
that
was
like
him
he
was
so
brave
and
kind
and
he
is
gone
there
was
no
room
for
widow
weeds
there
so
when
she
put
these
on
her
glittering
eyes
never
again
looked
through
her
pink
and
white
mask
and
she
was
glad
of
it
for
never
never
in
her
life
had
they
so
looked
for
anybody
but
her
dear
monsieur
john
and
now
he
was
in
heaven
so
the
priest
said
and
she
was
a
living
was
hard
work
and
as
madame
john
had
been
brought
up
tenderly
and
had
done
what
she
could
to
rear
her
daughter
in
the
same
mistaken
way
with
of
course
no
more
education
than
the
ladies
in
society
got
they
knew
nothing
beyond
a
little
music
and
embroidery
they
struggled
as
they
could
faintly
now
giving
a
few
private
dancing
lessons
now
dressing
hair
but
ever
beat
back
by
the
steady
detestation
of
their
imperious
patronesses
and
by
and
by
for
want
of
that
priceless
worldly
grace
known
among
the
flippant
as
these
two
poor
children
born
of
misfortune
and
the
complacent
badness
of
the
times
began
to
be
in
want
kristian
koppig
noticed
from
his
dormer
window
one
day
a
man
standing
at
the
big
archway
opposite
and
clanking
the
brass
knocker
on
the
wicket
that
was
in
one
of
the
doors
he
was
a
smooth
man
with
his
hair
parted
in
the
middle
and
his
cigarette
poised
on
a
tiny
gold
holder
he
waited
a
moment
politely
cursed
the
dust
knocked
again
threw
his
slender
under
his
arm
and
wiped
the
inside
of
his
hat
with
his
handkerchief
madame
john
held
a
parley
with
him
at
the
wicket
poulette
was
nowhere
seen
he
stood
at
the
gate
while
madame
john
went
kristian
koppig
knew
him
he
knew
him
as
one
knows
a
snake
he
was
the
manager
of
the
de
presently
madame
john
returned
with
a
little
bundle
and
they
hurried
off
together
and
now
what
did
this
mean
why
by
any
one
of
ordinary
acuteness
the
matter
was
easily
understood
but
to
tell
the
truth
kristian
koppig
was
a
trifle
dull
and
got
the
idea
at
once
that
some
damage
was
being
planned
against
poulette
it
made
the
gentle
dutchman
miserable
not
to
be
minding
his
own
business
and
yet
but
the
woman
certainly
will
not
attempt
said
he
to
himself
no
no
she
can
not
not
being
able
to
guess
what
he
meant
i
can
not
say
whether
she
could
or
not
i
know
that
next
day
kristian
koppig
glancing
eagerly
over
the
des
read
an
advertisement
which
he
had
always
before
skipped
with
a
frown
it
was
headed
de
and
being
interpreted
signified
that
a
new
dance
was
to
be
introduced
the
de
and
that
young
would
follow
it
with
the
famous
du
it
was
the
sabbath
the
young
man
watched
the
opposite
window
steadily
and
painfully
from
early
in
the
afternoon
until
the
moon
shone
bright
and
from
the
time
the
moon
shone
bright
until
madame
john
joy
madame
john
and
not
poulette
stepped
through
the
wicket
much
dressed
and
well
muffled
and
hurried
off
toward
the
madame
john
was
the
young
lady
and
the
young
man
mind
glad
to
return
to
its
own
unimpassioned
affairs
relapsed
into
quietude
madame
john
danced
beautifully
it
had
to
be
done
it
brought
some
pay
and
pay
was
bread
and
every
sunday
evening
with
a
touch
here
and
there
of
paint
and
powder
the
mother
danced
the
dance
of
the
shawl
the
daughter
remaining
at
home
alone
kristian
koppig
simple
young
dutchman
never
noticing
that
he
staid
at
home
with
his
window
darkened
for
the
very
purpose
would
see
her
come
to
her
window
and
look
out
with
a
little
wild
alarmed
look
in
her
magnificent
eyes
and
go
and
come
again
and
again
until
the
mother
like
a
bird
came
panting
home
two
or
three
months
went
by
one
night
on
the
mother
return
kristian
koppig
coming
to
his
room
nearly
at
the
same
moment
there
was
much
earnest
conversation
which
he
could
see
but
not
hear
poulette
said
madame
john

are
seventeen
true
maman
ah

child
i
see
not
how
you
are
to
meet

voice
trembled
plaintively
but
how
maman

pleasure
no
friend
maman
no
no
i
thank

long
there
is
no
place
in
this
world
for
us
poor
women
i
wish
that
we
were
either
white
or
black
and
the
tears
two
shining
ones
stood
in
the
poor
quadroon
eyes
tha
daughter
stood
up
her
eyes
flashing
god
made
us
maman
she
said
with
a
gentle
but
stately
smile
ha
said
the
mother
her
keen
glance
darting
through
her
tears
sin
made
yes

poulette

us
he
made
us
just
as

more
black
he
made
you
truly
said
zalli

so
beautiful
i
believe
it
well
she
reached
and
drew
the
fair
form
to
a
kneeling
posture
my
sweet
white
daughter
now
the
tears
were
in
the
girl
eyes
and
could
i
be
whiter
than
i
am
she
asked
oh
no
no
poulette
cried
the
other
but
if
we
were
only
white
both
of
us
so
that
some
gentleman
might
come
to
see
me
and
say
john

your
pretty
little
chick

my
life
i
would
give
my
soul
only

should
take
me
along
to
be
your
servant
i
walked
behind
two
young
men
they
ware
coming
home
from
their
office
presently
they
began
to
talk
about
you
poulette
eyes
flashed
fire
no
my
child
they
spoke
only
the
best
things
one
laughed
a
little
at
times
and
kept
saying
but
the
other
i
prayed
the
virgin
to
bless
him
he
spoke
such
kind
and
noble
words
such
gentle
pity
such
a
holy
heart
god
defend
her
he
said
he
said
god
defend
her
for
i
see
no
help
for
her
the
other
one
laughed
and
left
him
he
stopped
in
the
door
right
across
the
street
ah
my
child
do
you
blush
is
that
something
to
bring
the
rose
to
your
cheek
many
fine
gentlemen
at
the
ball
ask
me
often
is
your
daughter
madame
john
the
daughter
face
was
thrown
into
the
mother
lap
not
so
well
satisfied
now
with
god
handiwork
ah
how
she
wept
sob
sob
sob
gasps
and
sighs
and
stifled
ejaculations
her
small
right
hand
clinched
and
beating
on
her
mother
knee
and
the
mother
weeping
over
her
kristian
koppig
shut
his
window
nothing
but
a
generous
heart
and
a
dutchman
phlegm
could
have
done
so
at
that
moment
and
even
thou
kristian
koppig
for
the
window
closed
very
slowly
he
wrote
to
his
mother
thus
in
this
wicked
city
i
see
none
so
fair
as
the
poor
girl
who
lives
opposite
me
and
who
alas
though
so
fair
is
one
of
those
whom
the
taint
of
caste
has
cursed
she
lives
a
lonely
innocent
life
in
the
midst
of
corruption
like
the
lilies
i
find
here
in
the
marshew
and
i
have
great
pity
for
her
defend
her
i
said
to
a
fellow
clerk
see
no
help
for
her
i
know
there
is
a
natural
and
i
think
proper
horror
of
mixed
blood
excuse
the
mention
sweet
mother
and
i
feel
it
too
and
yet
if
she
were
in
holland
today
not
one
of
a
hundred
suitors
would
detect
the
hidden
blemish
in
such
strain
this
young
man
wrote
on
trying
to
demonstrate
the
utter
impossibility
of
his
ever
loving
the
lovable
unfortunate
until
the
midnight
tolling
of
the
cathedral
clock
sent
him
to
bed
about
the
same
hour
zalli
and
poulette
were
kissing
poulette
i
want
you
to
promise
me
one
thing
well
maman
if
any
gentleman
should
ever
love
you
and
ask
you
to
marry
not
knowing
you
know
promise
me
you
will
not
tell
him
you
are
not
white
it
can
never
be
said
poulette
but
if
it
should
said
madame
john
pleadingly
and
break
the
law
asked
poulette
impatiently
but
the
law
is
unjust
said
the
mother
but
it
is
the
law
but
you
will
not
dearie
will
you
i
would
surely
tell
him
said
the
daughter
when
zalli
for
some
cause
went
next
morning
to
the
window
she
started
poulette
she
called
softly
without
moving
the
daughter
came
the
young
man
whose
idea
of
propriety
had
actuated
him
to
this
display
was
sitting
in
the
dormer
window
reading
mother
and
daughter
bent
a
steady
gaze
at
each
other
it
meant
in
french
if
he
saw
us
last
night
ah
dear
said
the
mother
her
face
beaming
with
fun
what
can
it
be
maman
he
speaks
oh
ha
ha
he
speaks
such
miserable
french
it
came
to
pass
one
morning
at
early
dawn
that
zalli
and
poulette
going
to
mass
passed
a
café
just
as
who
should
be
coming
out
but
monsieur
the
manager
of
the
de
he
had
not
yet
gone
to
bed
monsieur
was
astonished
he
had
a
frenchman
eye
for
the
beautiful
and
certainly
there
the
beautiful
was
he
had
heard
of
madame
john
daughter
and
had
hoped
once
to
see
her
but
did
not
but
could
this
be
she
they
disappeared
within
the
cathedral
a
sudden
pang
of
piety
moved
him
he
followed
poulette
was
already
kneeling
in
the
aisle
zalli
still
in
the
vestibule
was
just
taking
her
hand
from
the
font
of
madame
john
whispered
the
manager
she
courtesied
madame
john
that
young
lady
is
she
your
daughter
she
she
is
my
daughter
said
zalli
with
somewhat
of
alarm
in
her
face
which
the
manager
misinterpreted
i
think
not
madame
john
he
shook
his
head
smiling
as
one
too
wise
to
be
fooled
yes
monsieur
she
is
my
daughter
o
no
madame
john
it
is
only
i
think
i
swear
she
is
monsieur
de
la
rue
is
that
possible
pretending
to
waver
but
convinced
in
his
heart
of
hearts
by
zalli
alarm
that
she
was
lying
but
how
why
does
she
not
come
to
our
with
you
zalli
trying
to
get
away
from
him
shrugged
and
smiled
each
to
his
taste
monsieur
it
pleases
her
not
she
was
escaping
but
he
followed
one
step
more
i
shall
come
to
see
you
madame
john
she
whirled
and
attacked
him
with
her
eyes
monsieur
must
not
give
himself
the
trouble
she
said
the
eyes
at
the
same
time
adding
dare
to
come
she
turned
again
and
knelt
to
her
devotions
the
manager
dipped
in
the
font
crossed
himself
and
departed
several
weeks
went
by
and
de
la
rue
had
not
accepted
the
fierce
challenge
of
madame
john
eyes
one
or
two
sunday
nights
she
had
succeeded
in
avoiding
him
though
fulfilling
her
engagement
in
the
but
by
and
by
a
saturday
came
round
and
though
the
pay
was
ready
she
was
loath
to
go
up
to
monsieur
little
office
it
was
an
afternoon
in
may
madame
john
came
to
her
own
room
and
with
a
sigh
sank
into
a
chair
her
eyes
were
wet
did
you
go
to
his
office
dear
mother
asked
poulette
i
could
not
she
answered
dropping
her
face
in
her
hands
maman
he
has
seen
me
at
the
window
while
i
was
gone
cried
the
mother
he
passed
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
he
looked
up
purposely
and
saw
me
the
speaker
cheeks
were
burning
red
zalli
wrung
her
hands
it
is
nothing
mother
do
not
go
near
him
but
the
pay
my
child
the
pay
matters
not
but
he
will
bring
it
here
he
wants
the
chance
that
was
the
trouble
sure
enough
about
this
time
kristian
koppig
lost
his
position
in
the
german
importing
house
where
he
had
fondly
told
his
mother
he
was
indispensable
summer
was
coming
on
the
senior
said
and
you
see
our
young
men
are
almost
idle
yes
our
engagement
for
a
year
but
ah
we
could
not
foresee
besides
attempting
a
parting
flattery
your
father
is
a
rich
gentleman
and
you
can
afford
to
take
the
summer
easy
if
we
can
ever
be
of
any
service
to
you
etc
so
the
young
dutchman
spent
the
afternoons
at
his
dormer
window
reading
and
glancing
down
at
the
little
casement
opposite
where
a
small
rude
shelf
had
lately
been
put
out
holding
a
row
of
with
wretched
little
botanical
specimens
in
them
trying
to
die
poulette
was
their
gardener
and
it
was
odd
to
see
dry
weather
or
wet
how
many
waterings
per
day
those
plants
could
take
she
never
looked
up
from
her
task
but
i
know
she
performed
it
with
that
unacknowledged
pleasure
which
all
girls
love
and
deny
that
of
being
looked
upon
by
noble
eyes
on
this
peculiar
saturday
afternoon
in
may
kristian
koppig
had
been
witness
of
the
distressful
scene
over
the
way
it
occurred
to
poulette
that
such
might
be
the
case
and
she
stepped
to
the
casement
to
shut
it
as
she
did
so
the
marvellous
delicacy
of
kristian
koppig
moved
him
to
draw
in
one
of
his
shutters
both
young
heads
came
out
at
one
moment
while
at
the
same
instant
rap
rap
rap
rap
rap
clanked
the
knocker
on
the
wicket
the
black
eyes
of
the
maiden
and
the
blue
over
the
way
from
looking
into
each
other
for
the
first
time
in
life
glanced
down
to
the
arched
doorway
upon
monsieur
the
manager
then
the
black
eyes
disappeared
within
and
kristian
koppig
thought
again
and
his
shutter
stood
up
at
the
window
prepared
to
become
a
bold
spectator
of
what
might
follow
but
for
a
moment
nothing
followed
trouble
over
there
thought
the
rosy
dutchman
and
waited
the
manager
waited
too
rubbing
his
hat
and
brushing
his
clothes
with
the
tips
of
his
kidded
fingers
they
do
not
wish
to
see
him
slowly
concluded
the
spectator
rap
rap
rap
rap
rap
quoth
the
knocker
and
de
la
rue
looked
up
around
at
the
windows
opposite
and
noticed
the
handsome
young
dutchman
looking
at
him
dutch
said
the
manager
softly
between
his
teeth
he
is
staring
at
me
said
kristian
koppig
to
himself
but
then
i
am
staring
at
him
which
accounts
for
it
a
long
pause
and
then
another
long
rapping
they
want
him
to
go
away
thought
koppig
knock
hard
suggested
a
street
youngster
standing
by
rap
rap
the
manager
had
no
sooner
recommenced
than
several
neighbors
looked
out
of
doors
and
windows
very
bad
thought
our
dutchman
somebody
should
make
him
go
off
i
wonder
what
they
will
do
the
manager
stepped
into
the
street
looked
up
at
the
closed
window
returned
to
the
knocker
and
stood
with
it
in
his
hand
they
are
all
gone
out
monsieur
said
the
you
lie
said
the
cynosure
of
neighboring
eyes
ah
thought
kristian
koppig
i
will
go
down
and
ask
him
here
his
thoughts
lost
outline
he
was
only
convinced
that
he
had
somewhat
to
say
to
him
and
turned
to
go
down
stairs
in
going
he
became
a
little
vexed
with
himself
because
he
could
not
help
hurrying
he
noticed
too
that
his
arm
holding
the
trembled
in
a
silly
way
whereas
he
was
perfectly
calm
precisely
as
he
reached
the
the
manager
raised
the
knocker
but
the
latch
clicked
and
the
wicket
was
drawn
slightly
ajar
inside
could
just
be
descried
madame
john
the
manager
bowed
smiled
talked
talked
on
held
money
in
his
hand
bowed
smiled
talked
on
flourished
the
money
smiled
bowed
talked
on
and
plainly
persisted
in
some
intention
to
which
madame
john
was
steadfastly
opposed
the
window
above
too
it
was
kristian
koppig
who
noticed
that
opened
a
wee
bit
like
the
shell
of
a
terrapin
presently
the
manager
lifted
his
foot
and
put
forward
an
arm
as
though
he
would
enter
the
gate
by
pushing
but
as
quick
as
gunpowder
it
clapped
in
his
face
you
could
hear
the
fleeing
feet
of
zalli
pounding
up
the
staircase
as
the
panting
mother
her
room
see
maman
said
poulette
peeping
at
the
window
the
young
gentleman
from
over
the
way
has
crossed
holy
mary
bless
him
said
the
mother
i
will
go
over
thought
kristian
koppig
and
ask
him
kindly
if
he
is
not
making
a
mistake
what
are
they
doing
dear
asked
the
mother
with
clasped
hands
they
are
talking
the
young
man
is
tranquil
but
de
la
rue
is
very
angry
whispered
the
daughter
and
just
then
pang
came
a
sharp
keen
sound
rattling
up
the
walls
on
either
side
of
the
narrow
way
and
aha
and
laughter
and
clapping
of
female
hands
from
two
or
three
windows
oh
what
a
slap
cried
the
girl
half
in
fright
half
in
glee
jerking
herself
back
from
the
casement
simultaneously
with
the
report
but
the
ahas
and
laughter
and
clapping
of
feminine
hands
which
still
continued
came
from
another
cause
poulette
rapid
action
had
struck
the
slender
cord
that
held
up
an
end
of
her
hanging
garden
and
the
whole
rank
of
slid
from
their
place
turned
gracefully
over
as
they
shot
through
the
air
and
emptied
themselves
plump
upon
the
head
of
the
slapped
manager
breathless
dirty
pale
as
whitewash
he
gasped
a
threat
to
be
heard
from
again
and
getting
round
the
corner
as
quick
as
he
could
walk
left
kristian
koppig
standing
motionless
the
most
astonished
man
in
that
street
kristian
koppig
kristian
koppig
said
greatheart
to
himself
slowly
dragging
what
a
mischief
you
have
done
one
poor
woman
certainly
to
be
robbed
of
her
bitter
wages
and
another
so
lovely
put
to
the
burning
shame
of
being
the
subject
of
a
street
brawl
what
will
this
silly
neighborhood
say
the
gentleman
a
heart
as
well
as
a
hand
it
jealousy
there
he
paused
afraid
himself
to
answer
the
supposed
query
and
then
oh
kristian
koppig
you
have
been
such
a
dunce
and
i
can
not
apologize
to
them
who
in
this
street
would
carry
my
note
and
not
wink
and
grin
over
it
with
low
surmises
i
can
not
even
make
restitution
money
they
would
not
dare
receive
it
oh
kristian
koppig
why
did
you
not
mind
your
own
business
is
she
any
thing
to
you
do
you
love
her
course
oh
such
a
dunce
the
reader
will
eagerly
admit
that
however
faulty
this
young
course
of
reasoning
his
conclusion
was
correct
for
mark
what
he
did
he
went
to
his
room
which
was
already
growing
dark
shut
his
window
lighted
his
big
dutch
lamp
and
sat
down
to
write
something
be
done
said
he
aloud
taking
up
his
pen
i
will
be
calm
and
cool
i
will
be
distant
and
brief
but
i
shall
have
to
be
kind
or
i
may
offend
ah
i
shall
have
to
write
in
french
i
forgot
that
i
write
it
so
poorly
dunce
that
i
am
when
all
my
brothers
and
sisters
speak
it
so
well
he
got
out
his
french
dictionary
two
hours
slipped
by
he
made
a
new
pen
washed
and
refilled
his
inkstand
mended
his
abominable
chair
and
after
two
hours
more
made
another
attempt
and
another
failure
my
head
aches
said
he
and
lay
down
on
his
couch
the
better
to
frame
his
phrases
he
was
awakened
by
the
sabbath
sunlight
the
bells
of
the
cathedral
and
the
ursulines
chapel
were
ringing
for
high
mass
and
a
perching
on
a
above
madame
john
rooms
was
carolling
whistling
mewing
chirping
screaming
and
trilling
with
the
ecstasy
of
a
whole
may
in
his
throat
oh
sleepy
kristian
koppig
was
the
young
man
first
thought
such
a
dunce
madame
john
and
daughter
did
not
go
to
mass
the
morning
wore
away
and
their
casement
remained
closed
they
are
offended
said
kristian
koppig
leaving
the
house
and
wandering
up
to
the
little
protestant
affair
known
as
christ
church
no
possibly
they
are
not
he
said
returning
and
finding
the
shutters
thrown
back
by
a
sad
accident
which
mortified
him
extremely
he
happened
to
see
late
in
the
afternoon
hardly
conscious
that
he
was
looking
across
the
street
that
madame
john
was
dressing
could
it
be
that
she
was
going
to
the
de
he
rushed
to
his
table
and
began
to
write
he
had
guessed
aright
the
wages
were
too
precious
to
be
lost
the
manager
had
written
her
a
note
he
begged
to
assure
her
that
he
was
a
gentleman
of
the
clearest
cut
if
he
had
made
a
mistake
the
previous
afternoon
he
was
glad
no
unfortunate
result
had
followed
except
his
having
been
assaulted
by
a
ruffian
that
the
du
was
promised
in
his
advertisement
and
he
hoped
madame
john
whose
wages
were
in
hand
waiting
for
her
would
not
fail
to
assist
as
usual
lastly
and
delicately
put
he
expressed
his
conviction
that
mademoiselle
was
wise
and
discreet
in
declining
to
entertain
gentlemen
at
her
home
so
against
much
beseeching
on
the
part
of
poulette
madame
john
was
going
to
the
maybe
i
can
discover
what
de
la
rue
is
planning
against
monsieur
over
the
way
she
said
knowing
certainly
the
slap
would
not
be
forgiven
and
the
daughter
though
tremblingly
at
once
withdrew
her
objections
the
heavy
young
dutchman
now
thoroughly
electrified
was
writing
like
mad
he
wrote
and
tore
up
wrote
and
tore
up
lighted
his
lamp
started
again
and
at
last
signed
his
name
a
letter
by
a
dutchman
in
french
what
can
be
made
of
it
in
english
we
will
see
madame
and
mademoiselle
a
stranger
seeking
not
to
be
acquainted
but
seeing
and
admiring
all
days
the
goodness
and
high
honor
begs
to
be
pardoned
of
them
for
the
mistakes
alas
of
yesterday
and
to
make
reparation
and
satisfaction
in
destroying
the
ornaments
of
the
window
as
well
as
the
loss
of
compensation
from
monsieur
the
manager
with
the
enclosed
bill
of
the
de
la
for
fifty
dollars
and
hoping
they
will
seeing
what
he
is
meaning
remains
respectfully
kristian
koppig
madame
must
not
go
to
the
ball
he
must
bear
the
missive
himself
he
must
speak
in
french
what
should
the
words
be
a
moment
of
study
he
has
it
and
is
off
down
the
long
stairway
at
the
same
moment
madame
john
stepped
from
the
wicket
and
glided
off
to
the
de
a
trifle
late
i
shall
see
madame
john
of
course
thought
the
young
man
crushing
a
hope
and
rattled
the
knocker
poulette
sprang
up
from
praying
for
her
mother
safety
what
has
she
forgotten
she
asked
herself
and
hastened
down
the
wicket
opened
the
two
innocents
were
stunned
aw
aw
said
the
pretty
dutchman
aw
blurted
out
something
in
virgin
dutch
handed
her
the
letter
and
hurried
down
street
alas
what
have
i
done
said
the
poor
girl
bending
over
her
candle
and
bursting
into
tears
that
fell
on
the
unopened
letter
and
what
shall
i
do
it
may
be
wrong
to
open
it
and
worse
not
to
like
her
sex
she
took
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
intensified
her
perplexity
and
misery
by
reading
and
misconstruing
the
all
but
unintelligible
contents
what
then
not
only
sobs
and
sighs
but
moaning
and
beating
of
little
fists
together
and
outcries
of
agony
stifled
against
the
bedside
and
temples
pressed
into
knitted
palms
because
of
one
who
sought
to
acquainted
but
offered
money
money
in
pity
to
a
poor
shame
on
her
for
saying
that
a
poor
and
now
our
dolt
turned
back
from
a
walk
concluding
there
might
be
an
answer
to
his
note
surely
madame
john
will
appear
this
time
he
knocked
the
shutter
stirred
above
and
something
white
came
fluttering
wildly
down
like
a
shot
dove
it
was
his
own
letter
containing
the
bill
he
bounded
to
the
wicket
and
softly
but
eagerly
knocked
again
go
away
said
a
trembling
voice
from
above
madame
john
said
he
but
the
window
closed
and
he
heard
a
step
the
same
step
on
the
stair
step
step
every
step
one
step
deeper
into
his
heart
poulette
came
to
the
closed
door
what
will
you
said
the
voice
within
i
i
do
wish
to
see
you
i
wish
to
see
madame
john
i
must
pray
monsieur
to
go
away
my
mother
is
at
the
de
at
the
ball
kristian
koppig
strayed
off
repeating
the
words
for
want
of
definite
thought
all
at
once
it
occurred
to
him
that
at
the
ball
he
could
make
madame
john
acquaintance
with
impunity
was
it
courting
sin
to
go
by
no
means
he
should
most
likely
save
a
woman
from
trouble
and
help
the
poor
in
their
distress
behold
kristian
koppig
standing
on
the
floor
of
the
de
a
large
hall
a
blaze
of
lamps
a
bewildering
flutter
of
fans
and
floating
robes
strains
of
music
columns
of
gay
promenaders
a
long
row
of
turbaned
mothers
lining
either
wall
gentlemen
of
the
portlier
sort
filling
the
recesses
of
the
windows
whirling
waltzers
gliding
here
and
there
smiles
and
grace
smiles
and
grace
all
fair
orderly
elegant
bewitching
a
young
creole
laugh
mayhap
a
little
loud
and
truly
there
were
many
but
neither
grace
nor
foulness
satisfied
the
eye
of
the
zealous
young
dutchman
suddenly
a
muffled
woman
passed
him
leaning
on
a
gentleman
arm
it
looked
like
it
must
be
madame
john
speak
quick
kristian
koppig
do
not
stop
to
notice
the
man
madame
john
bowing
i
am
your
neighbor
kristian
koppig
madame
john
bows
low
and
smiles
a
smile
but
is
frightened
and
her
escort
the
manager
drops
her
hand
and
slips
away
ah
monsieur
she
whispers
excitedly
you
will
be
killed
if
you
stay
here
a
moment
are
you
armed
no
take
this
she
tried
to
slip
a
dirk
into
his
hands
but
he
would
not
have
it
oh
my
dear
young
man
go
go
quickly
she
plead
glancing
furtively
down
the
hall
i
wish
you
not
to
dance
said
the
young
man
i
have
danced
already
i
am
going
home
come
be
quick
we
will
go
together
she
thrust
her
arm
through
his
and
they
hastened
into
the
street
when
a
square
had
been
passed
there
came
a
sound
of
men
running
behind
them
run
monsieur
run
she
cried
trying
to
drag
him
but
monsieur
dutchman
would
not
monsieur
oh
my
god
it
is
for
yesterday
cried
the
manager
striking
fiercely
with
his
cane
kristian
koppig
fist
rolled
him
in
the
dirt
for
poulette
cried
another
man
dealing
the
dutchman
a
terrible
blow
from
behind
and
for
me
hissed
a
third
thrusting
at
him
with
something
bright
for
yesterday
screamed
the
manager
bounding
like
a
tiger
that
that
ha
then
kristian
koppig
knew
that
he
was
stabbed
that
and
that
and
that
and
the
poor
dutchman
struck
wildly
here
and
there
grasped
the
air
shut
his
eyes
staggered
reeled
fell
rose
half
up
fell
again
for
good
and
they
were
kicking
him
and
jumping
on
him
all
at
once
they
scampered
zalli
had
found
the
went
a
rattle
went
another
pick
him
up
is
he
alive
ca
tell
hold
him
steady
lead
the
way
misses
he
bleeding
all
over
my
breeches
this
way
here
around
this
corner
this
way
now
only
two
squares
more
here
we
are
on
the
old
brass
knocker
curses
on
the
narrow
wicket
more
on
the
dark
archway
more
still
on
the
twisting
stairs
up
at
last
and
into
the
room
easy
easy
push
this
under
his
head
never
mind
his
boots
so
he
lies
on
poulette
own
bed
the
watch
are
gone
they
pause
under
the
corner
lamp
to
count
profits
a
single
bill
de
la
fifty
dollars
providence
is
kind
tolerably
so
break
it
at
the
guillaume
tell
but
did
you
ever
hear
any
one
scream
like
that
girl
did
and
there
lies
the
young
dutch
neighbor
his
money
will
not
flutter
back
to
him
this
time
nor
will
any
voice
behind
a
gate
beg
monsieur
to
go
away
o
woman
that
knows
no
enemy
so
terrible
as
man
come
nigh
poor
woman
you
have
nothing
to
fear
lay
your
strange
electric
touch
upon
the
chilly
flesh
it
strikes
no
eager
mischief
along
the
fainting
veins
look
your
sweet
looks
upon
the
grimy
face
and
tenderly
lay
back
the
locks
from
the
congested
brows
no
wicked
misinterpretation
lurks
to
bite
your
kindness
be
motherly
be
sisterly
fear
nought
go
watch
him
by
night
you
may
sleep
at
his
feet
and
he
will
not
stir
yet
he
lives
and
shall
live
may
live
to
forget
you
who
knows
but
for
all
that
be
gentle
and
watchful
be
womanlike
we
ask
no
more
and
god
reward
you
even
while
it
was
taking
all
the
two
women
strength
to
hold
the
door
against
death
the
sick
man
himself
laid
a
grief
upon
them
mother
he
said
to
madame
john
quite
a
master
of
french
in
his
delirium
dear
mother
fear
not
trust
your
boy
fear
nothing
i
will
not
marry
poulette
i
can
not
she
is
fair
dear
mother
but
ah
she
is
not
do
you
know
mother
do
you
know
the
race
the
race
do
you
know
that
she
is
jet
black
is
it
the
poor
nurse
nodded
yes
and
gave
a
sleeping
draught
but
before
the
patient
quite
slept
he
started
once
and
stared
take
her
away
waving
his
hand
take
your
beauty
away
she
is
jet
white
who
could
take
a
jet
white
wife
o
no
no
no
no
next
morning
his
brain
was
right
madame
he
weakly
whispered
i
was
delirious
last
night
zalli
shrugged
only
a
very
very
wee
wee
trifle
of
a
bit
and
did
i
say
something
wrong
or
foolish
o
no
no
she
replied
you
only
clasped
your
hands
so
and
prayed
prayed
all
the
time
to
the
dear
virgin
to
the
virgin
asked
the
dutchman
smiling
incredulously
and
joseph
yes
indeed
she
insisted
you
may
strike
me
dead
and
so
for
politeness
sake
he
tried
to
credit
the
invention
but
grew
suspicions
instead
hard
was
the
battle
against
death
nurses
are
sometimes
amazons
and
such
were
these
through
the
long
enervating
summer
the
contest
lasted
but
when
at
last
the
cool
airs
of
october
came
stealing
in
at
the
bedside
like
little
children
kristian
koppig
rose
upon
his
elbow
and
smiled
them
a
welcome
the
physician
blessed
man
was
kind
beyond
measure
but
said
some
inexplicable
things
which
zalli
tried
in
vain
to
make
him
speak
in
an
undertone
if
i
knew
monsieur
john
he
said
certainly
why
we
were
chums
at
school
and
he
left
you
so
much
as
that
madame
john
ah
my
old
friend
john
always
noble
and
you
had
it
all
in
that
naughty
bank
ah
well
madame
john
it
matters
little
no
i
shall
not
tell
poulette
adieu
and
another
time
if
i
will
let
you
tell
me
something
with
pleasure
madame
john
no
and
not
tell
anybody
madame
john
no
madame
not
even
poulette
what
a
long
whistle
is
that
and
monsieur
john
knew
it
encouraged
it
eh
well
eh
well
but
can
i
believe
you
madame
john
oh
you
have
monsieur
john
sworn
statement
ah
very
good
truly
but
you
you
have
it
but
where
is
it
ah
a
sceptical
shrug
pardon
me
madame
john
i
think
perhaps
you
are
telling
the
truth
if
i
think
you
did
right
certainly
what
nature
keeps
back
accident
sometimes
gives
madame
john
either
is
god
will
do
cry
from
the
dead
no
it
was
giving
yes
they
are
thanking
you
in
heaven
madame
john
kristian
koppig
lying
awake
but
motionless
and
with
closed
eyes
hears
in
part
and
fancying
he
understands
rejoices
with
silent
intensity
when
the
doctor
is
gone
he
calls
zalli
i
give
you
a
great
deal
of
trouble
eh
madame
john
no
no
you
are
no
trouble
at
all
had
you
the
yellow
fever
ah
then
she
rolled
her
eyes
to
signify
the
superlative
character
of
the
tribulations
attending
yellow
fever
i
had
a
lady
and
gentleman
once
a
spanish
lady
and
gentleman
just
off
the
ship
both
sick
at
once
with
the
fever
delirious
could
not
tell
their
names
nobody
to
help
me
but
sometimes
monsieur
john
i
never
had
such
a
time
never
before
never
since
as
that
time
four
days
and
nights
this
head
touched
not
a
pillow
and
they
died
said
kristian
koppig
the
third
night
the
gentleman
went
poor
senor
john
he
did
not
know
the
harm
gave
him
some
coffee
and
toast
the
fourth
night
it
rained
and
turned
cool
and
just
before
day
the
poor
lady
died
said
koppig
zalli
dropped
her
arms
listlessly
into
her
lap
and
her
eyes
ran
brimful
and
left
an
infant
said
the
dutchman
ready
to
shout
with
exultation
ah
no
monsieur
said
zalli
the
invalid
heart
sank
like
a
stone
madame
john
his
voice
was
all
in
a
tremor
tell
me
the
truth
is
poulette
your
own
child
ha
ha
what
foolishness
of
course
she
is
my
child
and
madame
gave
vent
to
a
true
frenchwoman
laugh
it
was
too
much
for
the
sick
man
in
the
pitiful
weakness
of
his
shattered
nerves
he
turned
his
face
into
his
pillow
and
wept
like
a
child
zalli
passed
into
the
next
room
to
hide
her
emotion
maman
dear
maman
said
poulette
who
had
overheard
nothing
but
only
saw
the
tears
ah
my
child
my
child
my
task
my
task
is
too
great
too
great
for
me
let
me
go
now
another
time
go
and
watch
at
his
bedside
but
maman
for
poulette
was
frightened
he
needs
no
care
now
nay
but
go
my
child
i
wish
to
be
alone
the
maiden
stole
in
with
averted
eyes
and
tiptoed
to
the
window
the
patient
already
a
man
again
gazed
at
her
till
she
could
feel
the
gaze
he
turned
his
eyes
from
her
a
moment
to
gather
resolution
and
now
stout
heart
farewell
a
word
or
two
of
friendly
parting
nothing
more
poulette
the
slender
figure
at
the
window
turned
and
came
to
the
bedside
i
believe
i
owe
my
life
to
you
he
said
she
looked
down
meekly
the
color
rising
in
her
cheek
i
must
arrange
to
be
moved
across
the
street
tomorrow
on
a
litter
she
did
not
stir
or
speak
and
i
must
now
thank
you
sweet
nurse
for
your
care
sweet
nurse
sweet
nurse
she
shook
her
head
in
protestation
heaven
bless
you
poulette
her
face
sank
lower
god
has
made
you
very
beautiful
tite
poulette
she
stirred
not
he
reached
and
gently
took
her
little
hand
and
as
he
drew
her
one
step
nearer
a
tear
fell
from
her
long
lashes
from
the
next
room
zalli
with
a
face
of
agonized
suspense
gazed
upon
the
pair
undiscovered
the
young
man
lifted
the
hand
to
lay
it
upon
his
lips
when
with
a
mild
firm
force
it
was
drawn
away
yet
still
rested
in
his
own
upon
the
bedside
like
some
weak
thing
snared
that
could
only
not
get
free
thou
wilt
not
have
my
love
poulette
no
answer
thou
wilt
not
beautiful
can
not
was
all
that
she
could
utter
and
upon
their
clasped
hands
the
tears
ran
down
thou
me
poulette
thou
dost
not
trust
me
thou
fearest
the
kiss
may
loosen
the
hands
but
i
tell
thee
nay
i
have
struggled
hard
even
to
this
hour
against
love
but
i
yield
me
now
i
yield
i
am
his
unconditioned
prisoner
forever
god
forbid
that
i
ask
aught
but
that
you
will
be

stands
a
large
brick
building
that
has
so
stood
for
about
of
a
century
its
rooms
are
rented
to
a
class
of
persons
occupying
them
simply
for
lack
of
activity
to
find
better
and
cheaper
quarters
elsewhere
with
its
gray
stucco
peeling
off
in
broad
patches
it
has
a
solemn
look
of
gentility
in
rags
and
stands
or
as
it
were
hangs
about
the
corner
of
two
ancient
streets

peep
through

a
square
court
within

with
many
lines
of
wet
clothes
its
sides
hugged
by
rotten
staircases

the
landlord
is
one
kookoo
an
ancient
creole
of
doubtful
purity
of
blood
who
in
his
landlordly
old
age
takes
all
suggestions
of
repairs
as
personal
insults
he
was
but
a
stripling
when
his
father
left
him
this
inheritance
and
has
grown
old
and
wrinkled
and
brown
a
sort
of
periodically
animate
mummy
in
the
business
he
smokes
cascarilla
wears
velveteen
and
is
as
punctual
as
an
executioner
to
kookoo
venerable
property
a
certain
old
man
used
for
many
years
to
come
every
evening
stumbling
through
the
groups
of
prattling
children
who
frolicked
about
in
the
early
moonlight
whose
name
no
one
knew
but
whom
all
the
neighbors
designated
by
the
title
of
george
it
was
his
wont
to
be
seen
taking
a
straight
too
straight
course
toward
his
home
never
careening
to
right
or
left
but
now
forcing
himself
slowly
forward
as
though
there
were
a
high
gale
in
front
and
now
scudding
briskly
ahead
at
a
ridiculous
little
as
if
there
were
a
tornado
behind
he
would
go
up
the
main
staircase
very
carefully
sometimes
stopping
up
for
thirty
or
forty
minutes
doze
but
getting
to
the
landing
eventually
and
tramping
into
his
room
in
the
second
story
with
no
little
elation
to
find
it
still
there
were
it
not
for
these
slight
symptoms
of
potations
he
was
such
a
one
as
you
would
pick
out
of
a
thousand
for
a
miser
a
year
or
two
ago
he
suddenly
disappeared
a
great
many
years
ago
when
the
old
house
was
still
new
a
young
man
with
no
baggage
save
a
small
came
and
took
the
room
i
have
mentioned
and
another
adjoining
he
supposed
he
might
stay
fifty
days
and
he
staid
fifty
years
and
over
this
was
a
very
fashionable
neighborhood
and
he
kept
the
rooms
on
that
account
month
after
month
but
when
he
had
been
here
about
a
year
something
happened
to
him
so
it
was
rumored
that
greatly
changed
the
tenor
of
his
life
and
from
that
time
on
there
began
to
appear
in
him
and
to
accumulate
upon
each
other
in
a
manner
which
became
the
profound
study
of
kookoo
the
symptoms
of
a
decay
whose
cause
baffled
the
landlord
limited
powers
of
conjecture
for
half
a
century
hints
of
a
duel
of
a
reason
warped
of
disinheritance
and
many
other
unauthorized
rumors
fluttered
up
and
floated
off
while
he
became
recluse
and
some
say
began
incidentally
to
betray
the
unmanly
habit
which
we
have
already
noticed
his
neighbors
would
have
continued
neighborly
had
he
allowed
them
but
he
never
let
himself
be
understood
and
are
very
droll
anyhow
so
as
they
could
do
nothing
else
they
cut
him
so
exclusive
he
became
that
though
it
may
have
been
for
economy
he
never
admitted
even
a
housemaid
but
kept
his
apartments
himself
only
the
merry
serenaders
who
in
those
times
used
to
sing
under
the
balconies
would
now
and
then
give
him
a
crumb
of
their
feast
for
pure
fun
sake
and
after
a
while
because
they
could
not
find
out
his
full
name
called
him
at
hazard
george
but
always
prefixing
monsieur
afterward
when
he
began
to
be
careless
in
his
dress
and
the
fashion
of
serenading
had
passed
away
the
commoner
people
dared
to
shorten
the
title
to
george
many
seasons
came
and
went
the
city
changed
like
a
growing
boy
gentility
and
fashion
went
uptown
but
george
still
retained
his
rooms
every
one
knew
him
slightly
and
bowed
but
no
one
seemed
to
know
him
well
unless
it
were
a
brace
or
so
of
those
convivial
fellows
in
at
little
fort
charles
he
often
came
home
late
with
one
of
these
on
either
arm
all
singing
different
tunes
and
stopping
at
every
twenty
steps
to
tell
secrets
but
by
and
by
the
fort
was
demolished
church
and
goverment
property
melted
down
under
the
warm
demand
for
the
city
spread
like
a
ringworm
and
one
day
george
steps
out
of
the
old
house
in
full
regimentals
the
creole
neighbors
rush
bareheaded
into
the
middle
of
the
street
as
though
there
were
an
earthquake
or
a
chimney
on
fire
what
to
do
or
say
or
think
they
do
not
know
they
are
at
their
wits
ends
therefore
happy
however
there
is
a
german
blacksmith
shop
near
by
and
they
watch
to
see
what
will
do
jacob
steps
into
the
street
with
every
eye
upon
him
he
approaches
monsieur
he
addresses
to
him
a
few
remarks
they
shake
hands
they
engage
in
some
conversation
monsieur
places
his
hand
on
his
sword
now
monsieur
passes
the
populace
crowd
around
the
blacksmith
children
clap
their
hands
softly
and
jump
up
and
down
on
tiptoes
of
expectation
george
is
going
to
the
war
in
mexico
ah
says
a
little
girl
in
the
throng
sieur
george
two
rooms
will
be
empty
i
find
that
very
droll
the
landlord
this
same
kookoo
is
in
the
group
he
hurls
himself
into
the
house
and
up
the
stairs
fifteen
years
pass
since
he
have
been
in
those
room
he
arrives
at
the
door
it
is
shut
it
is
lock
in
short
further
investigation
revealed
that
a
youngish
lady
in
black
who
had
been
seen
by
several
neighbors
to
enter
the
house
but
had
not
of
course
been
suspected
of
such
remarkable
intentions
had
in
company
with
a
taken
these
two
rooms
and
now
at
the
door
proffered
a
month
rent
in
advance
what
could
a
landlord
do
but
smile
yet
there
was
a
pretext
left
the
rooms
must
need
repairs
no
sir
he
could
look
in
and
see
joy
he
looked
in
all
was
neatness
the
floor
unbroken
the
walls
cracked
but
a
little
and
the
cracks
closed
with
new
plaster
no
doubt
by
the
jealous
hand
of
george
himself
kookoo
eyes
swept
sharply
round
the
two
apartments
the
furniture
was
all
there
moreover
there
was
little
he
should
not
soon
forget
that
trunk
one
day
fifteen
years
or
more
before
he
had
taken
hold
of
that
trunk
to
assist
monsieur
to
arrange
his
apartment
and
monsieur
had
drawn
his
fist
back
and
cried
to
him
to
drop
it
there
it
was
looking
very
suspicious
in
kookoo
eyes
and
the
lady
domestic
as
tidy
as
a
went
and
sat
on
it
could
that
trunk
contain
treasure
it
might
for
madame
wanted
to
shut
the
door
and
in
fact
did
so
the
lady
was
quite
handsome
had
been
more
so
but
was
still
young
spoke
the
beautiful
language
and
kept
in
the
inner
room
her
discreet
and
taciturn
mulattress
a
tall
straight
woman
with
a
fierce
eye
but
called
by
the
young
creoles
of
the
neighborhood
confound
good
lookin
among
where
the
new
neighbor
always
expects
to
be
called
upon
by
the
older
residents
this
lady
might
have
made
friends
in
spite
of
being
as
reserved
as
george
but
the
reverse
being
the
creole
custom
and
she
being
well
pleased
to
keep
her
own
company
chose
mystery
rather
than
society
the
poor
landlord
was
sorely
troubled
it
must
not
that
any
thing
take
place
in
his
house
he
watched
the
two
rooms
narrowly
but
without
result
save
to
find
that
madame
plied
her
needle
for
pay
spent
her
money
for
little
else
besides
harpstrings
and
took
good
care
of
the
little
trunk
of
monsieur
this
espionage
was
a
good
turn
to
the
mistress
and
maid
for
when
kookoo
announced
that
all
was
proper
no
more
was
said
by
outsiders
their
landlord
never
got
but
one
question
answered
by
the
maid
madame
he
feared
was
a
litt
bit
embarrass
money
eh
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
you
notice
had
some
property
but
did
not
want
to
eat
it
up
sometimes
came
in
very
elegant
private
carriages
to
see
her
and
one
or
two
seemed
to
beg
her
but
in
vain
to
go
away
with
them
but
these
gradually
dropped
off
until
lady
and
servant
were
alone
in
the
world
and
so
years
and
the
mexican
war
went
by
the
volunteers
came
home
peace
reigned
and
the
city
went
on
spreading
up
and
down
the
land
but
george
did
not
return
it
overran
the
country
like
fields
roads
woodlands
that
were
once
george
places
of
retreat
from
mankind
were
covered
all
over
with
little
houses
in
the
old
third
and
fine
residences
and
gardens
up
in
lafayette
streets
went
slicing
like
a
butcher
knife
through
old
colonial
estates
whose
first
masters
never
dreamed
of
the
city
reaching
them
and
george
was
still
away
the
brick
got
old
and
ugly
and
the
surroundings
dim
and
dreamy
theatres
processions
stores
government
establishments
banks
hotels
and
all
spirit
of
enterprise
were
gone
to
canal
street
and
beyond
and
the
very
beggars
were
gone
with
them
the
little
trunk
got
very
old
and
bald
and
still
its
owner
lingered
still
the
lady
somewhat
the
worse
for
lapse
of
time
looked
from
the
in
the
brief
southern
twilights
and
the
maid
every
morning
shook
a
worn
rug
or
two
over
the
railing
and
yet
neither
had
made
friends
or
enemies
the
two
rooms
from
having
been
stingily
kept
at
first
were
needing
repairs
half
the
time
and
the
occupants
were
often
moving
now
into
one
now
back
into
the
other
yet
the
was
seen
only
by
glimpses
the
landlord
to
his
infinite
chagrin
always
being
a
little
too
late
in
offering
his
services
the
women
whether
it
was
light
or
heavy
having
already
moved
it
he
thought
it
significant
late
one
day
of
a
most
bitter
winter
that
season
when
to
the
ecstatic
amazement
of
a
whole
of
children
snow
covered
the
streets
there
came
a
soft
tap
on
the
of
this
pair
of
rooms
the
lady
opened
it
and
beheld
a
tall
lank
man
a
total
stranger
standing
behind
monsieur
george
both
men
were
scarred
and
tattered
across
george
crown
leaving
a
long
bare
streak
through
his
white
hair
was
the
souvenir
of
a
mexican
sabre
the
landlord
had
accompanied
them
to
the
door
it
was
a
magnificent
opportunity
mademoiselle
asked
them
all
in
and
tried
to
furnish
a
seat
to
each
but
failing
george
went
straight
across
the
room
and
on
the
the
action
was
so
conspicuous
the
landlord
laid
it
up
in
his
penetrative
mind
george
was
quiet
or
as
it
appeared
quieted
the
mulattress
stood
near
him
and
to
her
he
addressed
in
an
undertone
most
of
the
little
he
said
leaving
mademoiselle
to
his
companion
the
stranger
was
a
warm
talker
and
seemed
to
please
the
lady
from
the
first
but
if
he
pleased
nothing
else
did
kookoo
intensely
curious
sought
some
pretext
for
staying
but
found
none
they
were
altogether
an
uncongenial
company
the
lady
seemed
to
think
kookoo
had
no
business
there
george
seemed
to
think
the
same
concerning
his
companion
and
the
few
words
between
mademoiselle
and
george
were
cool
enough
the
maid
appeared
nearly
satisfied
but
could
not
avoid
casting
an
anxious
eye
at
times
upon
her
mistress
naturally
the
visit
was
short
the
next
day
but
one
the
two
gentlemen
came
again
in
better
attire
george
evidently
disliked
his
companion
yet
would
not
rid
himself
of
him
the
stranger
was
a
gesticulating
stagy
fellow
much
monsieur
junior
an
incessant
talker
in
always
excited
on
small
matters
and
unable
to
appreciate
a
great
one
once
as
they
were
leaving
kookoo
accidents
will
happen
was
under
the
stairs
as
they
began
to
descend
the
tall
man
was
speaking
better
to
bury
it
the
startled
landlord
heard
him
say
and
held
his
breath
thinking
of
the
trunk
but
no
more
was
uttered
a
week
later
they
came
again
a
week
later
they
came
again
a
week
later
they
came
yet
again
the
landlord
eyes
began
to
open
there
must
be
a
courtship
in
progress
it
was
very
plain
now
why
george
had
wished
not
to
be
accompanied
by
the
rail
gentleman
but
since
his
visits
had
become
regular
and
frequent
it
was
equally
plain
why
he
did
not
get
rid
of
him
because
it
would
not
look
well
to
be
going
and
coming
too
often
alone
maybe
it
was
only
this
tender
passion
that
the
tall
man
had
thought
better
to
bury
lately
there
often
came
sounds
of
gay
conversation
from
the
first
of
the
two
rooms
which
had
been
turned
into
a
parlor
and
as
week
after
week
the
friends
came
the
tall
man
was
always
in
high
spirits
and
anxious
to
embrace
george
who
sly
dog
thought
the
landlord
would
try
to
look
grave
and
only
smiled
in
an
embarrassed
way
ah
monsieur
you
tink
to
be
varry
conning
you
not
so
conning
as
kookoo
no
and
the
inquisitive
little
man
would
shake
his
head
and
smile
and
shake
his
head
again
as
a
man
has
a
perfect
right
to
do
under
the
conviction
that
he
has
been
for
twenty
years
baffled
by
a
riddle
and
is
learning
to
read
it
at
last
he
had
guessed
what
was
in
george
head
he
would
by
and
by
guess
what
was
in
the
trunk
a
few
months
passed
quickly
away
and
it
became
apparent
to
every
eye
in
or
about
the
ancient
mansion
that
the
landlord
guess
was
not
so
bad
in
fact
that
mademoiselle
was
to
be
married
on
a
certain
rainy
spring
afternoon
a
single
hired
hack
drove
up
to
the
main
entrance
of
the
old
house
and
after
some
little
bustle
and
the
gathering
of
a
crowd
of
damp
children
about
the
big
doorway
george
muffled
in
a
overcoat
jumped
out
and
went
a
moment
later
he
leading
mademoiselle
wreathed
and
veiled
down
the
stairway
very
fair
was
mademoiselle
still
her
beauty
was
mature
fully
ripe
maybe
a
little
too
much
so
but
only
a
little
and
as
she
came
down
with
the
ravishing
odor
of
bridal
flowers
floating
about
her
she
seemed
the
garlanded
victim
of
a
pagan
sacrifice
the
mulattress
in
holiday
gear
followed
behind
the
landlord
owed
a
duty
to
the
community
he
arrested
the
maid
on
the
last
step
your
mistress
she
goin
george
it
make
me
glad
glad
glad
marry
george
non
monsieur
non
not
marrie
george
she
going
to
marry
the
tall
gentleman
ze
long
gentyman
with
his
hands
upon
his
forehead
he
watched
the
carriage
trundle
away
it
passed
out
of
sight
through
the
rain
he
turned
to
enter
the
house
and
all
at
once
tottered
under
the
weight
of
a
tremendous
thought
they
had
left
the
trunk
he
hurled
himself
as
he
had
done
seven
years
before
but
again
ah
bah
the
door
was
locked
and
not
a
picayune
of
rent
due
late
that
night
a
small
square
man
in
a
wet
overcoat
fumbled
his
way
into
the
damp
entrance
of
the
house
stumbled
up
the
cracking
stairs
unlocked
after
many
languid
efforts
the
door
of
the
two
rooms
and
falling
over
the
slept
until
the
morning
sunbeams
climbed
over
the
balcony
and
in
at
the
window
and
shone
full
on
the
back
of
his
head
old
kookoo
passing
the
door
just
then
was
surprised
to
find
it
slightly
ajar
pushed
it
open
silently
and
saw
within
george
in
the
act
of
rising
from
his
knees
beside
the
mysterious
trunk
he
had
come
back
to
be
once
more
the
tenant
of
the
two
rooms
george
for
the
second
time
was
a
changed
man
changed
from
bad
to
worse
from
being
retired
and
reticent
he
had
come
by
reason
of
advancing
years
or
mayhap
that
which
had
left
the
terrible
scar
on
his
face
to
be
garrulous
when
once
in
a
while
employment
sought
him
for
he
never
sought
employment
whatever
remuneration
he
received
went
its
way
for
something
that
left
him
dingy
and
threadbare
he
now
made
a
lively
acquaintance
with
his
landlord
as
indeed
with
every
soul
in
the
neighborhood
and
told
all
his
adventures
in
mexican
prisons
and
cuban
cities
including
full
details
of
the
hardships
and
perils
experienced
jointly
with
the
long
gentleman
who
had
married
mademoiselle
and
who
was
no
mexican
or
cuban
but
a
genuine
louisianian
it
was
he
that
fancied
me
he
said
not
i
him
but
once
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
me
i
had
the
force
to
cast
him
off
how
madame
ever
should
have
liked
him
was
one
of
those
woman
freaks
that
a
man
expect
to
understand
he
was
no
more
fit
for
her
than
rags
are
fit
for
a
queen
and
i
could
have
choked
his
head
off
the
night
he
hugged
me
round
the
neck
and
told
me
what
a
suicide
she
had
committed
but
other
fine
women
are
committing
that
same
folly
every
day
only
they
do
wait
until
they
or
five
to
do
do
i
like
him
well
for
one
reason
he
a
drunkard
here
kookoo
whose
imperfect
knowledge
of
english
prevented
his
intelligent
reception
of
the
story
would
laugh
as
if
the
joke
came
in
just
at
this
point
however
with
all
monsieur
prattle
he
never
dropped
a
word
about
the
man
he
had
been
before
he
went
away
and
the
great
puzzle
was
still
the
same
puzzle
growing
greater
every
day
thus
the
two
rooms
had
been
the
scene
of
some
events
quite
queer
if
not
really
strange
but
the
queerest
that
ever
they
presented
i
guess
was
george
coming
in
there
one
day
crying
like
a
little
child
and
bearing
in
his
arms
an
infant
a
girl
the
lovely
offspring
of
the
drunkard
whom
he
so
detested
and
poor
robbed
and
now
dead
madame
he
took
good
care
of
the
orphan
for
orphan
she
was
very
soon
the
long
gentleman
was
pulled
out
of
the
old
basin
one
morning
and
george
identified
the
body
at
the
trémé
station
he
never
hired
a
nurse
the
father
had
sold
the
lady
maid
quite
out
of
sight
so
he
brought
her
through
all
the
little
ills
and
around
all
the
sharp
corners
of
and
childhood
without
a
human
hand
to
help
him
until
one
evening
having
persistently
shut
his
eyes
to
it
for
weeks
and
months
like
one
trying
to
sleep
in
the
sunshine
he
awoke
to
the
realization
that
she
was
a
woman
it
was
a
smoky
one
in
november
the
first
cool
day
of
autumn
the
sunset
was
dimmed
by
the
smoke
of
burning
prairies
the
air
was
full
of
the
ashes
of
grass
and
reeds
ragged
urchins
were
lugging
home
sticks
of
cordwood
and
when
a
bit
of
coal
fell
from
a
cart
in
front
of
kookoo
old
house
a
child
was
boxed
half
across
the
street
and
robbed
of
the
booty
by
a
de
from
over
the
way
the
old
man
came
home
quite
steady
he
mounted
the
stairs
smartly
without
stopping
to
rest
went
with
a
step
unusually
light
and
quiet
to
his
chamber
and
sat
by
the
window
opening
upon
the
rusty
balcony
it
was
a
small
room
sadly
changed
from
what
it
had
been
in
old
times
but
then
so
was
george
close
and
dark
it
was
the
walls
stained
with
dampness
and
the
ceiling
full
of
bald
places
that
showed
the
lathing
the
furniture
was
cheap
and
meagre
including
conspicuously
the
small
the
floor
was
of
wide
slabs
fastened
down
with
spikes
and
sloping
up
and
down
in
one
or
two
broad
undulations
as
if
they
had
drifted
far
enough
down
the
current
of
time
to
feel
the
however
the
floor
was
clean
the
bed
well
made
the
cypress
table
in
place
and
the
musty
smell
of
the
walls
partly
neutralized
by
a
geranium
on
the
he
so
coming
in
and
sitting
down
an
unseen
person
called
from
the
room
adjoining
of
which
also
he
was
still
the
rentee
to
know
if
he
were
he
and
being
answered
in
the
affirmative
said
papa
george
guess
who
was
here
kookoo
for
the
rent
yes
but
he
will
not
come
back
no
why
not
because
you
will
not
pay
him
no
and
why
not
because
i
have
paid
him
impossible
where
did
you
get
the
money
can
not
guess
mother
nativity
what
not
for
embroidery
no
and
why
not
oui
saying
which
and
with
a
pleasant
laugh
the
speaker
entered
the
room
she
was
a
girl
of
sixteen
or
thereabout
very
beautiful
with
very
black
hair
and
eyes
a
face
and
form
more
entirely
out
of
place
you
could
not
have
found
in
the
whole
city
she
sat
herself
at
his
feet
and
with
her
interlocked
hands
upon
his
knee
and
her
face
full
of
childish
innocence
mingled
with
womanly
wisdom
turned
to
his
appeared
for
a
time
to
take
principal
part
in
a
conversation
which
of
course
could
not
be
overheard
in
the
corridor
outside
whatever
was
said
she
presently
rose
he
opened
his
arms
and
she
sat
on
his
knee
and
kissed
him
this
done
there
was
a
silence
both
smiling
pensively
and
gazing
out
over
the
rotten
balcony
into
the
street
after
a
while
she
started
up
saying
something
about
the
change
of
weather
and
slipping
away
thrust
a
match
between
the
bars
of
the
grate
the
old
man
turned
about
to
the
fire
and
she
from
her
little
room
brought
a
low
and
sat
beside
him
laying
her
head
on
his
knee
and
he
stroking
her
brow
with
his
brown
palm
and
then
in
an
altered
a
low
sad
tone
he
began
a
monotonous
recital
thus
they
sat
he
talking
very
steadily
and
she
listening
until
all
the
neighborhood
was
wrapped
in
slumber
all
the
neighbors
but
not
kookoo
kookoo
in
his
old
age
had
become
a
great
eavesdropper
his
ear
and
eye
took
turns
at
the
keyhole
that
night
for
he
tells
things
that
were
not
intended
for
outside
hearers
he
heard
the
girl
sobbing
and
the
old
man
saying
but
you
must
go
now
you
can
not
stay
with
me
safely
or
decently
much
as
i
wish
it
the
lord
only
knows
how
i
to
bear
it
or
where
you
to
go
but
he
your
lord
child
and
he
make
a
place
for
you
i
was
your
grandfather
death
i
frittered
your
poor
dead
mother
fortune
away
let
that
be
the
last
damage
i
do
i
have
always
meant
everything
for
the
best
he
added
half
in
soliloquy
from
all
kookoo
could
gather
he
must
have
been
telling
her
the
very
story
just
recounted
she
had
dropped
quite
to
the
floor
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
and
was
saying
between
her
sobs
i
can
not
go
papa
george
oh
papa
george
i
can
not
go
just
then
george
kaving
kept
a
good
resolution
all
day
was
encouraged
by
the
orphan
pitiful
tones
to
contemplate
the
most
senseless
act
he
ever
attempted
to
commit
he
said
to
the
sobbing
girl
that
she
was
not
of
his
blood
that
she
was
nothing
to
him
by
natural
ties
that
his
covenant
was
with
her
grandsire
to
care
for
his
offspring
and
though
it
had
been
poorly
kept
it
might
be
breaking
it
worse
than
ever
to
turn
her
out
upon
ever
so
kind
a
world
i
have
tried
to
be
good
to
you
all
these
years
when
i
took
you
a
wee
little
baby
i
took
you
for
better
or
worse
i
intended
to
do
well
by
you
all
your
and
to
do
best
at
last
i
thought
surely
we
should
be
living
well
by
this
time
and
you
could
choose
from
a
world
full
of
homes
and
a
world
full
of
friends
i
do
see
how
i
missed
it
here
he
paused
a
moment
in
meditation
and
presently
resumed
with
some
suddenness
i
thought
that
education
far
better
than
mother
nativity
has
given
you
should
have
afforded
your
sweet
charms
a
noble
setting
that
good
mothers
and
sisters
would
be
wanting
to
count
you
into
their
families
and
that
the
blossom
of
a
happy
womanhood
would
open
perfect
and
full
of
sweetness
i
would
have
given
my
life
for
it
i
did
give
it
such
as
it
was
but
it
was
a
very
poor
concern
i
know
my
life
and
not
enough
to
buy
any
good
thing
i
have
had
a
thought
of
something
but
i
afraid
to
tell
it
it
come
to
me
or
yesterday
it
has
beset
me
a
long
time
for
months
the
girl
gazed
into
the
embers
listening
intensely
and
oh
dearie
if
i
could
only
get
you
to
think
the
same
way
you
might
stay
with
me
then
how
long
she
asked
without
stirring
oh
is
long
as
heaven
should
let
us
but
there
is
only
one
chance
he
said
as
it
were
feeling
his
way
only
one
way
for
us
to
stay
together
do
you
understand
me
she
looked
up
at
the
old
man
with
a
glance
of
painful
inquiry
if
you
could
be
my
wife
dearie
she
uttered
a
low
distressful
cry
and
gliding
swiftly
into
her
room
for
the
first
time
in
her
young
life
turned
the
key
between
them
and
the
old
man
sat
and
wept
then
kookoo
peering
through
the
keyhole
saw
that
they
had
been
looking
into
the
little
trunk
the
lid
was
up
but
the
back
was
toward
the
door
and
he
could
see
no
more
than
if
it
had
been
closed
he
stooped
and
stared
into
the
aperture
until
his
dry
old
knees
were
ready
to
crack
it
seemed
as
if
george
was
stone
only
stone
could
weep
like
that
every
separate
bone
in
his
neck
was
hot
with
pain
he
would
have
given
ten
dollars
ten
sweet
dollars
to
have
seen
george
get
up
and
turn
that
trunk
around
there
george
rose
up
what
a
face
he
started
toward
the
bed
and
as
he
came
to
the
trunk
he
paused
looked
at
it
muttered
something
about
ruin
and
something
about
fortune
kicked
the
lid
down
and
threw
himself
across
the
bed
small
profit
to
old
kookoo
that
he
went
to
his
own
couch
sleep
was
not
for
the
little
landlord
for
half
a
century
he
had
suspected
his
tenant
of
having
a
treasure
hidden
in
his
house
and
he
had
heard
his
own
admission
that
in
the
little
trunk
was
a
fortune
kookoo
had
never
felt
so
poor
in
all
his
days
before
he
felt
a
creole
anger
too
that
a
tenant
should
be
the
holder
of
wealth
while
his
landlord
suffered
poverty
and
he
knew
very
well
too
did
kookoo
what
the
tenant
would
do
if
he
did
not
know
what
he
kept
in
the
trunk
he
knew
what
he
kept
behind
it
and
he
knew
he
would
take
enough
of
it
to
make
him
sleep
soundly
no
one
would
ever
have
supposed
kookoo
capable
of
a
crime
he
was
too
fearfully
impressed
with
the
risks
of
dishonesty
he
was
old
too
and
weak
and
besides
all
intensely
a
coward
nevertheless
while
it
was
yet
two
or
three
hours
before
daybreak
the
little
man
arose
shuffled
into
his
garments
and
in
his
sought
the
corridor
leading
to
george
apartment
the
november
night
as
it
often
does
in
that
region
had
grown
warm
and
clear
the
stars
were
sparkling
like
diamonds
pendent
in
the
deep
blue
heavens
and
at
every
window
and
lattice
and
cranny
the
broad
bright
moon
poured
down
its
glittering
beams
upon
the
thief
as
he
crept
along
the
mouldering
galleries
and
down
the
ancient
corridor
that
led
to
george
chamber
george
door
though
ever
so
slowly
opened
protested
with
a
loud
creak
the
landlord
wet
with
cold
sweat
from
head
to
foot
and
shaking
till
the
floor
trembled
paused
for
several
minutes
and
then
entered
the
apartment
the
tenant
lying
as
if
he
had
not
moved
was
sleeping
heavily
and
now
the
poor
coward
trembled
so
that
to
kneel
before
the
trunk
without
falling
he
did
not
know
how
twice
thrice
he
was
near
tumbling
headlong
he
became
as
cold
as
ice
but
the
sleeper
stirred
and
the
thought
of
losing
his
opportunity
strung
his
nerves
up
in
an
instant
he
went
softly
down
upon
his
knees
laid
his
hands
upon
the
lid
lifted
it
and
let
in
the
intense
moonlight
the
trunk
was
full
full
crowded
down
and
running
over
full
of
the
tickets
of
the
havana
lottery
a
little
after
daybreak
kookoo
from
his
window
saw
the
orphan
pausing
on
the
corner
she
stood
for
a
moment
and
then
dove
into
the
dense
fog
which
had
floated
in
from
the
river
and
disappeared
he
never
saw
her
again
but
her
lord
is
taking
care
of
her
once
only
she
has
seen
george
she
had
been
in
the
belvedere
of
the
house
which
she
now
calls
home
looking
down
upon
the
outspread
city
far
away
southward
and
westward
the
great
river
glistened
in
the
sunset
along
its
sweeping
bends
the
chimneys
of
a
smoking
commerce
the
magazines
of
surplus
wealth
the
gardens
of
the
opulent
the
steeples
of
a
hundred
sanctuaries
and
thousands
on
thousands
of
mansions
and
hovels
covered
the
fertile
birthright
arpents
which
george
in
his
fifty
stay
had
seen
tricked
away
from
dull
colonial
esaus
by
their
brethren
of
the
north
nearer
by
she
looked
upon
the
forlornly
silent
region
of
lowly
dwellings
neglected
by
legislation
and
shunned
by
all
lovers
of
comfort
that
once
had
been
the
smiling
fields
of
her
own
grandsire
broad
plantation
and
but
a
little
way
off
trudging
across
the
marshy
commons
her
eye
caught
sight
of
george
following
the
sunset
out
upon
the
prairies
to
find
a
night
rest
in
the
high
grass
she
turned
at
once
gathered
the
skirt
of
her
pink
calico
uniform
and
watching
her
steps
through
her
tears
descended
the
steep
to
her
frequent
under
the
fragrant
candles
of
the
in
mother
nativity
asylum
george
is
houseless
he
can
not
find
the
orphan
mother
nativity
seems
to
know
nothing
of
her
if
he
could
find
her
now
and
could
get
from
her
the
use
of
ten
dollars
for
but
three
days
he
knows
a
combination
which
would
repair
all
the
past
it
could
not
fail
he
thinks
but
he
can
not
find
her
and
the
letters
he
writes
all
containing
the
one
scheme
disappear
in
the
and
there
an
end
madame
délicieuse
just
adjoining
the
old
café
de
poésie
on
the
corner
stood
the
little
tenement
of
mossy
with
its
two
glass
doors
protected
by
batten
shutters
and
its
low
tile
roof
sloping
out
over
the
sidewalk
you
were
very
likely
to
find
the
doctor
in
for
he
was
a
great
student
and
rather
negligent
of
his
business
as
business
he
was
a
small
sedate
creole
gentleman
of
thirty
or
more
with
a
face
and
manner
that
provoked
instant
admiration
he
would
receive
you
be
you
who
you
may
in
a
mild
candid
manner
looking
into
your
face
with
his
deep
blue
eyes
and
you
with
a
modest
amiable
smile
very
sweet
and
rare
on
a
man
mouth
to
be
frank
the
doctor
little
establishment
was
dusty
and
disorderly
very
it
was
curious
to
see
the
jars
and
jars
and
jars
in
them
were
serpents
and
hideous
fishes
and
precious
specimens
of
many
sorts
there
were
stuffed
birds
on
broken
perches
and
dried
lizards
and
eels
and
little
alligators
and
old
skulls
with
their
crowns
sawed
off
and
ten
thousand
odd
scraps
of
strewn
with
crumbs
of
lonely
lunches
and
interspersed
with
spatulas
and
lancets
all
new
orleans
at
least
all
creole
new
orleans
knew
and
yet
did
not
know
the
dear
little
doctor
so
gentle
so
kind
so
skilful
so
patient
so
lenient
so
careless
of
the
rich
and
so
attentive
to
the
poor
a
man
all
in
all
such
as
should
you
once
love
him
you
would
love
him
forever
so
very
learned
too
but
with
apparently
no
idea
of
how
to
to
his
social
profit
two
features
much
more
smiled
at
than
respected
not
to
say
admired
by
a
people
remote
from
the
seats
of
learning
and
spending
most
of
their
esteem
upon
animal
heroisms
and
exterior
display
alas
said
his
wealthy
acquaintances
what
a
pity
when
he
might
as
well
be
rich
yes
his
father
has
plenty
certainly
and
gives
it
freely
but
intends
his
son
shall
see
none
of
it
his
son
you
dare
not
so
much
as
mention
him
well
well
how
strange
but
they
can
never
agree
not
even
upon
their
name
is
not
that
droll
a
man
named
general
villivicencio
and
his
son
dr
mossy
oh
that
is
nothing
it
is
only
that
the
doctor
drops
the
drops
the
villivicencio
but
i
think
the
drops
him
ho
ho
ho
next
to
the
residence
of
good
mossy
towered
the
narrow
mansion
of
young
madame
délicieuse
firm
friend
at
once
and
always
of
those
two
antipodes
general
villivicencio
and
mossy
its
dark
covered
was
ever
rumbling
and
with
nightfall
its
always
sent
forth
a
luxurious
light
from
the
windows
of
the
balconies
it
was
one
of
the
sights
of
the
rue
royale
to
see
by
night
its
tall
narrow
outline
reaching
high
up
toward
the
stars
with
all
its
windows
aglow
the
madame
had
had
some
tastes
of
human
experience
had
been
betrothed
at
sixteen
to
a
man
she
did
not
love
being
at
that
time
a
fool
as
she
said
one
summer
day
at
noon
had
been
a
bride
and
at
sundown
a
widow
accidental
discharge
of
the
tipsy
bridegroom
own
pistol
pass
it
by
it
left
but
one
lasting
effect
on
her
a
special
detestation
of
quarrels
and
weapons
the
little
maidens
whom
poor
parentage
has
doomed
to
sit
upon
street
and
nurse
their
infant
brothers
have
a
game
of
choosing
the
beautiful
ladies
who
sweep
by
along
the
pavement
but
in
rue
royale
there
was
no
choosing
every
little
damsel
must
own
madame
délicieuse
or
nobody
and
as
that
richly
adorned
and
regal
favorite
of
old
general
villivicencio
came
along
they
would
lift
their
big
bold
eyes
away
up
to
her
face
and
pour
forth
their
admiration
in
a
universal
but
mark
you
she
was
good
madame
délicieuse
as
well
as
fair
madame
délicieuse
her
principles
however
not
constructed
in
the
austere
style
exactly
what
need
with
the
lattice
of
the
confessional
not
a
stone
throw
off
her
kind
offices
and
beneficent
schemes
were
almost
as
famous
as
general
villivicencio
splendid
alms
if
she
could
at
times
do
what
the
infantile
washington
said
he
could
not
why
no
doubt
she
and
her
friends
generally
looked
upon
it
as
a
mere
question
of
enterprise
she
had
charms
too
of
intellect
albeit
not
such
a
sinner
against
time
and
place
as
to
be
an
educated
woman
charms
that
even
in
a
plainer
person
would
have
brought
down
the
half
of
new
orleans
upon
one
knee
with
both
hands
on
the
left
side
had
the
city
at
her
feet
and
with
the
fine
tact
which
was
the
perfection
of
her
character
kept
it
there
contented
madame
was
in
short
one
of
the
kind
that
gracefully
wrest
from
society
the
prerogative
of
doing
as
they
please
and
had
gone
even
to
such
extravagant
lengths
as
driving
out
in
the
faubourg
learning
the
english
tongue
talking
national
politics
and
similar
freaks
whereby
she
provoked
the
unbounded
worship
of
her
less
audacious
lady
friends
in
the
centre
of
the
cluster
of
creole
beauties
which
everywhere
gathered
about
her
and
most
of
all
in
those
incomparable
companies
which
assembled
in
her
own
splendid
she
was
always
queen
lily
her
house
her
etc
for
the
little
brown
aunt
who
lived
with
her
was
a
mere
piece
of
curious
furniture
there
was
this
notable
charm
about
madame
délicieuse
she
improved
by
comparison
she
never
looked
so
grand
as
when
hanging
on
general
villivicencio
arm
at
some
gorgeous
ball
these
two
bore
down
on
you
like
a
royal
barge
lashed
to
a
she
never
looked
so
like
her
sweet
name
as
when
she
seated
her
prettiest
lady
adorers
close
around
her
and
got
them
all
of
the
two
balconies
which
overhung
the
on
the
front
of
the
délicieuse
house
one
was
a
small
affair
and
the
other
a
deeper
and
broader
one
from
which
madame
and
her
ladies
were
wont
upon
gala
days
to
wave
handkerchiefs
and
cast
flowers
to
the
friends
in
the
processions
there
they
gathered
one
eighth
of
january
morning
to
see
the
military
display
it
was
a
bright
blue
day
and
the
group
that
quite
filled
the
balcony
had
laid
wrappings
aside
as
all
are
apt
to
do
on
such
creole
january
days
and
shone
resplendent
in
spring
attire
the
passing
below
looked
up
by
hundreds
and
smiled
at
the
ladies
eager
twitter
as
flirting
in
fashion
from
one
subject
to
another
they
laughed
away
the
waiting
for
the
pageant
by
and
by
they
fell
for
madame
délicieuse
had
begun
a
narrative
concerning
mossy
she
sat
somewhat
above
her
listeners
her
elbow
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
and
her
plump
white
hand
waving
now
and
then
in
graceful
gesture
they
silently
attending
with
eyes
full
of
laughter
and
lips
starting
apart
she
said
they
conversed
in
french
of
course
you
know
it
is
now
long
that
mossy
and
his
father
have
been
in
disaccord
indeed
when
have
they
not
differed
for
when
mossy
was
but
a
little
boy
his
father
thought
it
hard
that
he
was
not
a
rowdy
he
switched
him
once
because
he
would
not
play
with
his
toy
gun
and
drum
he
was
not
so
high
when
his
father
wished
to
send
him
to
paris
to
enter
the
french
army
but
he
would
not
go
we
used
to
play
often
together
on
the
for
i
am
not
so
very
many
years
younger
than
he
no
indeed
and
if
i
wanted
some
fun
i
had
only
to
pull
his
hair
and
run
into
the
house
he
would
cry
and
monsieur
papa
would
come
out
with
his
hand
spread
open
and
madame
gave
her
hand
a
malicious
little
sweep
and
joined
heartily
in
the
laugh
which
followed
that
was
when
they
lived
over
the
way
but
wait
you
shall
see
i
have
something
this
evening
the
general
the
houses
of
rue
royale
gave
a
start
and
rattled
their
windows
in
the
long
irregular
line
of
balconies
the
beauty
of
the
city
rose
up
then
the
houses
jumped
again
and
the
windows
rattled
madame
steps
inside
the
window
and
gives
a
message
which
the
housemaid
smiles
at
in
receiving
as
she
turns
the
houses
shake
again
and
now
again
and
now
there
comes
a
distant
strain
of
trumpets
and
by
and
by
the
drums
and
bayonets
and
clattering
hoofs
and
plumes
and
dancing
banners
far
down
the
long
street
stretch
out
the
shining
ranks
of
gallant
men
and
the
fluttering
swarms
of
ladies
shower
down
their
sweet
favors
and
wave
their
countless
welcomes
in
the
front
towering
above
his
captains
rides
general
villivicencio
veteran
of
and
with
the
gracious
pomp
of
the
gentleman
lifts
his
cocked
hat
and
bows
and
bows
madame
délicieuse
balcony
was
a
perfect
maze
of
waving
kerchiefs
the
general
looked
up
for
the
woman
of
all
women
she
was
not
there
but
he
remembered
the
other
balcony
the
smaller
one
and
cast
his
glance
onward
to
it
there
he
saw
madame
and
one
other
person
only
a
small
man
whom
the
arch
lady
had
lured
from
his
pen
by
means
of
a
mock
professional
summons
and
who
now
stood
beside
her
a
smile
of
pleasure
playing
on
his
lips
and
about
his
eyes
said
madame
as
the
father
eyes
met
the
son
mossy
lifted
his
arm
and
cast
a
bouquet
of
roses
a
girl
in
the
crowd
bounded
forward
caught
it
in
the
air
and
blushing
handed
it
to
the
plumed
giant
he
bowed
low
first
to
the
girl
then
to
the
balcony
above
and
then
with
a
responsive
smile
tossed
up
two
splendid
kisses
one
to
madame
and
one
it
seemed
for
what
was
that
cheer
why
did
you
not
see
general
villivicencio
cast
a
kiss
to
his
son
the
staff
of
general
villivicencio
were
a
faithful
few
who
had
not
bowed
the
knee
to
any
abomination
of
the
américains
nor
sworn
deceitfully
to
any
species
of
compromise
their
beloved
city
was
presently
to
pass
into
the
throes
of
an
election
and
this
band
heroically
unconscious
of
their
feebleness
putting
their
trust
in
and
like
delusions
resolved
to
make
one
more
stand
for
the
traditions
of
their
fathers
it
was
concerning
this
that
madame
délicieuse
was
incidentally
about
to
speak
when
interrupted
by
the
boom
of
cannon
they
had
promised
to
meet
at
her
house
that
evening
they
met
with
very
little
discussion
or
delay
for
their
minds
were
made
up
beforehand
it
was
decided
to
announce
in
the
newspaper
that
at
a
meeting
of
leading
citizens
it
had
been
thought
consonant
with
the
public
interest
to
place
before
the
people
the
name
of
general
hercule
mossy
de
villivicencio
no
explanation
was
considered
necessary
all
had
been
done
in
strict
accordance
with
customs
and
if
any
one
did
not
know
it
it
was
his
own
fault
no
eulogium
was
to
follow
no
editorial
indorsement
the
two
announcements
were
destined
to
stand
next
morning
one
on
the
english
side
and
one
on
the
french
in
severe
simplicity
to
be
greeted
with
profound
gratification
by
a
few
old
gentlemen
in
blue
cottonade
and
by
roars
of
laughter
from
a
rampant
majority
as
the
junto
were
departing
sparkling
madame
délicieuse
detained
the
general
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
that
descended
into
the
tiled
to
wish
she
was
a
man
that
she
might
vote
for
him
but
general
she
said
had
i
not
a
beautiful
bouquet
of
ladies
on
my
balcony
this
morning
the
general
replied
with
majestic
gallantry
that
it
was
as
magnificent
as
could
be
expected
with
the
central
rose
wanting
and
so
madame
was
disappointed
for
she
was
trying
to
force
the
general
to
mention
his
son
i
will
bear
this
no
longer
he
shall
not
rest
she
had
said
to
her
little
aunt
until
he
has
either
kissed
his
son
or
quarrelled
with
him
to
which
the
aunt
had
answered
that
que
she
need
not
cry
about
it
nor
did
she
though
the
general
compliment
had
foiled
her
thrust
she
answered
gayly
to
the
effect
that
enough
was
enough
but
ah
general
dropping
her
voice
to
an
undertone
if
you
had
heard
what
some
of
those
rosebuds
said
of
you
the
old
general
pricked
up
like
a
country
beau
madame
laughed
to
herself
monsieur
peacock
i
have
thee
but
aloud
she
said
gravely
come
into
the
if
you
please
and
seat
yourself
you
must
be
greatly
fatigued
the
friends
who
waited
below
overheard
the
invitation
revoir
said
they
revoir
messieurs
he
answered
and
followed
the
lady
general
said
she
as
if
her
heart
were
overflowing
you
have
been
spoken
against
please
sit
down
is
that
true
madame
yes
general
she
sank
into
a
luxurious
chair
a
lady
said
but
you
will
be
angry
with
me
general
with
you
madame
that
is
not
possible
i
do
not
love
to
make
revelations
general
but
when
a
noble
friend
is
evil
spoken
of
she
leaned
her
brow
upon
her
thumb
and
forefinger
and
looked
pensively
at
her
slipper
toe
peeping
out
at
the
edge
of
her
skirt
on
the
rich
carpet
one
heart
gets
very
big
madame
you
are
an
angel
but
what
said
she
madame
well
general
i
have
to
tell
you
the
whole
truth
if
you
will
not
be
angry
we
were
all
speaking
at
once
of
handsome
men
she
said
to
me
madame
délicieuse
you
may
say
what
you
will
of
general
villivicencio
and
i
suppose
it
is
true
but
everybody
knows
pardon
me
general
but
just
so
she
said
the
world
knows
he
treats
his
son
very
badly
it
is
not
true
said
the
general
if
i
was
angry
said
madame
making
a
pretty
fist
can
that
be
i
said
she
said
says
he
has
been
angry
with
his
son
for
fifteen
years
what
did
his
son
do
i
said
said
she
i
said
i
too
would
be
angry
if
my
son
had
done
nothing
for
fifteen
years
ho
ho
ho
it
is
not
true
said
the
general
the
old
general
cleared
his
throat
and
smiled
as
by
compulsion
you
know
general
said
madame
looking
distressed
it
was
nothing
to
joke
about
but
i
had
to
say
so
because
i
did
not
know
what
your
son
had
done
nor
did
i
wish
to
hear
any
thing
against
one
who
has
the
honor
to
call
you
his
father
she
paused
a
moment
to
let
the
flattery
take
effect
and
then
proceeded
but
then
another
lady
said
to
me
she
said
shame
clarisse
to
laugh
at
good
mossy
nobody
neither
general
villivicencio
neither
any
other
has
a
right
to
be
angry
against
that
noble
gentle
kind
brave
brave
said
the
general
with
a
touch
of
irony
so
she
said
answered
madame
délicieuse
and
i
asked
her
brave
she
said
braver
than
in
tending
the
the
cholera
the
fevers
and
all
those
horrible
things
me
i
saw
his
father
once
run
from
a
snake
i
think
would
fight
the
my
faith
she
said
say
that
mossy
does
all
that
and
never
wears
a
scapula
and
does
it
nine
hundred
and
times
in
a
thousand
for
nothing
that
brave
madame
délicieuse
or
is
it
not
and
general
what
could
i
say
madame
dropped
her
palms
on
either
side
of
her
spreading
robes
and
waited
pleadingly
for
an
answer
there
was
no
sound
but
the
drumming
of
the
general
fingers
on
his
madame
resumed
i
said
do
not
deny
that
mossy
is
a
noble
gentleman
i
had
to
say
that
had
i
not
general
certainly
madame
said
the
general
my
son
is
a
gentleman
yes
i
said
should
not
make
monsieur
his
father
angry
true
said
the
general
eagerly
but
that
lady
said
his
father
makes
himself
angry
she
said
you
know
madame
why
his
father
is
angry
so
long
another
lady
says
know
what
said
i
he
refused
to
become
a
soldier
mamma
told
me
that
can
not
be
i
said
the
general
flushed
madame
saw
it
but
relentlessly
continued
said
that
lady
i
said
you
general
villivicencio
will
not
rather
be
the
very
man
most
certain
to
respect
a
son
who
has
the
courage
to
be
his
own
master
oh
what
does
he
want
with
a
poor
fool
of
a
son
who
will
do
only
as
he
says
you
think
he
will
love
him
less
for
healing
instead
of
killing
mesdemoiselles
you
do
not
know
that
noble
soldier
the
noble
soldier
glowed
and
bowed
his
acknowledgments
in
a
dubious
half
remonstrative
way
as
if
madame
might
be
producing
material
for
her
next
confession
as
indeed
she
diligently
was
doing
but
she
went
straight
on
once
more
as
a
surgeon
would
but
that
other
lady
said
madame
no
ladies
but
i
am
going
to
tell
you
why
monsieur
the
general
is
angry
with
his
son
well
why
it
is
just
because
he
is
a
little
man
general
villivicencio
stood
straight
up
ah
mon
ami
cried
the
lady
rising
excitedly
i
have
wounded
you
and
made
you
angry
with
my
silly
revelations
pardon
me
my
friend
those
were
foolish
girls
and
anyhow
they
admired
you
they
said
you
looked
glorious
grand
at
the
head
of
the
procession
now
all
at
once
the
general
felt
the
tremendous
fatigues
of
the
day
there
was
a
wild
swimming
whirling
sensation
in
his
head
that
forced
him
to
let
his
eyelids
sink
down
yet
just
there
in
the
midst
of
his
painful
bewilderment
he
realized
with
ecstatic
complacency
that
the
most
man
in
louisiana
was
standing
in
his
spurs
with
the
hand
of
louisiana
queenliest
woman
laid
tenderly
on
his
arm
i
am
a
wretched
tattler
said
she
ah
no
madame
you
are
my
dearest
friend
yes
well
anyhow
i
called
them
fools
innocent
creatures
i
said
you
a
man
of
his
sense
and
goodness
giving
his
thousands
to
the
sick
and
afflicted
will
cease
to
love
his
only
son
because
he
is
not
big
like
a
horse
or
quarrelsome
like
a
dog
no
ladies
there
is
a
great
reason
which
none
of
you
know
well
they
cried
it
he
has
need
of
a
very
good
reason
tell
it
now
ladies
i
said
must
not
for
general
for
all
the
world
i
knew
not
a
reason
why
you
should
be
angry
against
your
son
you
know
general
you
have
never
told
me
the
beauty
again
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
gazed
with
simplicity
into
his
sombre
countenance
for
an
instant
her
witchery
had
almost
conquered
nay
madame
some
day
i
shall
tell
you
i
have
more
than
one
burden
but
let
me
ask
you
to
be
seated
for
i
have
a
question
also
for
you
which
i
have
longed
to
ask
it
lies
heavily
upon
my
heart
i
must
ask
it
now
a
matter
of
so
great
importance
madame
little
brown
aunt
gave
a
faint
cough
from
a
dim
corner
of
the
room
is
a
beautiful
night
she
remarked
and
stepped
out
on
the
balcony
then
the
general
asked
his
question
it
was
a
very
long
question
or
maybe
repeated
twice
or
thrice
for
it
was
fully
ten
minutes
before
he
moved
out
of
the
room
saying
ah
old
general
villivicencio
the
most
man
in
louisiana
but
what
would
the
people
the
people
who
cheered
in
the
morning
have
said
to
see
the
fair
queen
délicieuse
at
the
top
of
the
stair
sweetly
bowing
you
down
into
the
starlight
humbled
crestfallen
rejected
the
campaign
opened
the
villivicencio
ticket
was
read
in
french
and
english
with
the
very
different
sentiments
already
noted
in
the
exchange
about
the
courts
among
the
banks
there
was
lively
talking
concerning
its
intrinsic
excellence
and
extrinsic
chances
the
young
gentlemen
who
stood
about
the
doors
of
the
talked
with
a
frantic
energy
alarming
to
any
stranger
and
just
when
you
would
have
expected
to
see
them
jump
and
bite
large
mouthfuls
out
of
each
other
face
they
would
turn
and
enter
the
door
talking
on
in
the
same
furious
manner
and
walking
up
to
the
bar
click
their
glasses
to
the
success
of
the
villivicencio
ticket
sundry
swarthy
and
wrinkled
remnants
of
an
earlier
generation
were
still
more
enthusiastic
there
was
to
be
a
happy
renaissance
a
purging
out
of
yankee
ideas
a
blessed
of
those
good
old
bourbon
morals
and
manners
which
yankee
notions
had
expatriated
in
the
cheerfulness
of
their
anticipations
they
even
went
the
length
of
throwing
their
feet
high
in
air
thus
indicating
how
the
villivicencio
ticket
was
going
to
give
doze
américains
the
kick
under
the
nose
in
the
three
or
four
weeks
which
followed
the
general
gathered
a
surfeit
of
adulation
notwithstanding
which
he
was
constantly
and
with
pain
imagining
a
confused
chatter
of
ladies
and
when
he
shut
his
eyes
with
annoyance
there
was
madame
délicieuse
standing
and
saying
i
knew
not
a
reason
why
you
should
be
angry
against
your
son
gazing
in
his
face
with
hardened
simplicity
and
then
that
last
scene
on
the
stairs
wherein
he
seemed
still
to
be
descending
down
down
madame
herself
was
keeping
good
her
resolution
now
or
never
she
said
a
reconciliation
or
a
quarrel
when
the
general
to
keep
up
appearances
called
again
she
so
moved
him
with
an
account
of
certain
kindly
speeches
of
her
own
invention
which
she
imputed
to
mossy
that
he
promised
to
call
and
see
his
son
perhaps
pretty
soon
probably
mossy
sitting
one
february
morning
among
his
specimens
and
books
of
reference
finishing
a
thrilling
chapter
on
the
cuticle
too
absorbed
to
hear
a
door
open
suddenly
realized
that
something
was
in
his
light
and
looking
up
beheld
general
villivicencio
standing
over
him
breathing
a
pleased
sigh
he
put
down
his
pen
and
rising
on
tiptoe
laid
his
hand
upon
his
father
shoulder
and
lifting
his
lips
like
a
little
wife
kissed
him
be
seated
papa
he
said
offering
his
own
chair
and
perching
on
the
desk
the
general
took
it
and
clearing
his
throat
gazed
around
upon
the
jars
and
jars
with
their
little
adams
and
eves
in
zoölogical
gardens
is
all
going
well
papa
finally
asked
mossy
yes
then
there
was
a
long
pause
is
a
beautiful
day
said
the
son
very
beautiful
rejoined
the
father
i
thought
there
would
have
been
a
rain
but
it
has
cleared
off
said
the
son
yes
responded
the
father
and
drummed
on
the
desk
does
it
appear
to
be
turning
cool
asked
the
son
no
it
does
not
appear
to
be
turning
cool
at
all
was
the
answer
h
said
mossy
hem
said
general
villivicencio
mossy
not
realizing
his
own
action
stole
a
glance
at
his
manuscript
i
am
interrupting
you
said
the
general
quickly
and
rose
no
no
pardon
me
be
seated
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
doing
it
is
the
work
with
which
i
fill
my
leisure
moments
so
the
general
settled
down
again
and
father
and
son
sat
very
close
to
each
other
in
a
bodily
sense
spiritually
they
were
many
miles
apart
the
general
softly
tapping
the
desk
had
the
sound
of
drums
the
city
it
is
healthy
asked
the
general
did
you
ask
me
if
said
the
little
doctor
starting
and
looking
up
the
city
it
has
not
much
sickness
at
present
repeated
the
father
no
yes
not
much
said
mossy
and
with
utter
unconsciousness
leaned
down
upon
his
elbow
and
supplied
an
omitted
word
to
the
manuscript
the
general
was
on
his
feet
as
if
by
the
touch
of
a
spring
i
must
go
ah
no
papa
said
the
son
but
yes
i
must
but
wait
papa
i
had
just
now
something
to
speak
of
well
said
the
general
standing
with
his
hand
on
the
door
and
with
rather
a
dark
countenance
mossy
touched
his
fingers
to
his
forehead
trying
to
remember
i
fear
i
have
ah
i
rejoice
to
see
your
name
before
the
public
dear
papa
and
at
the
head
of
the
ticket
the
general
displeasure
sank
down
like
an
eagle
feathers
he
smiled
thankfully
and
bowed
my
friends
compelled
me
he
said
they
think
you
will
be
elected
they
will
not
doubt
it
but
what
think
you
my
son
now
the
son
had
a
conviction
which
it
would
have
been
madness
to
express
so
he
only
said
they
could
not
elect
one
more
faithful
the
general
bowed
solemnly
perhaps
the
people
will
think
so
my
friends
believe
they
will
your
friends
who
have
used
your
name
should
help
you
as
much
as
they
can
papa
said
the
doctor
myself
i
should
like
to
assist
you
papa
if
i
could
said
the
pleased
father
incredulously
but
yes
said
the
son
a
thrill
of
delight
filled
the
general
frame
was
like
a
son
thank
you
my
son
i
thank
you
much
ah
mossy
my
dear
boy
you
make
me
happy
but
added
mossy
realizing
with
a
tremor
how
far
he
had
gone
i
see
not
how
it
is
possible
the
general
chin
dropped
not
being
a
public
man
continued
the
doctor
unless
indeed
my
pen
you
might
enlist
my
pen
he
paused
with
a
smile
of
bashful
inquiry
the
general
stood
aghast
for
a
moment
and
then
caught
the
idea
certainly
ha
ha
ha
backing
out
of
the
door
certainly
ah
mossy
you
are
right
to
be
sure
to
make
a
complete
world
we
must
have
swords
pens
well
my
son
revoir
no
i
can
not
stay
i
will
return
i
hasten
to
tell
my
friends
that
the
pen
of
mossy
is
on
our
side
adieu
dear
son
standing
outside
on
the
he
bowed
not
to
mossy
but
to
the
balcony
of
the
big
front
a
most
sunshiny
smile
and
departed
the
very
next
morning
as
if
fate
had
ordered
it
the
villivicencio
ticket
was
attacked
ambushed
as
it
were
from
behind
the
américain
newspaper
the
onslaught
was
at
least
general
villivicencio
said
it
was
absolutely
ruffianly
never
had
all
the
lofty
courtesies
and
formalities
of
chivalric
contest
been
so
completely
ignored
poisoned
balls
at
least
personal
epithets
were
used
the
general
himself
was
called
antiquated
the
friends
who
had
nominated
him
they
were
positively
sneered
at
dubbed
fossils
old
ladies
and
their
caucus
termed
irresponsible
thunder
and
lightning
gentlemen
of
honor
to
be
termed
not
responsible
it
was
asserted
that
the
nomination
was
made
secretly
in
a
private
house
by
two
or
three
unauthorized
that
touched
the
very
bone
who
had
with
more
caution
than
propriety
withheld
their
names
the
article
was
headed
the
ticket
it
continued
further
to
say
that
had
not
the
publication
of
this
ticket
been
regarded
as
a
dull
hoax
it
would
not
have
been
suffered
to
pass
for
two
weeks
unchallenged
and
that
it
was
now
high
time
the
universal
wish
should
be
realized
in
its
withdrawal
among
the
earliest
readers
of
this
production
was
the
young
madame
she
first
enjoyed
a
quiet
gleeful
smile
over
it
and
then
called
ninide
here
take
this
down
to
dr
mossy
stop
she
marked
the
communication
heavily
with
her
gold
pencil
no
answer
he
need
not
return
it
about
the
same
hour
and
in
a
neighboring
street
one
of
the
not
responsibles
knocked
on
the
villivicencio
castle
gate
the
general
invited
him
into
his
bedroom
with
a
short
and
strictly
profane
harangue
the
visitor
produced
the
offensive
newspaper
and
was
about
to
begin
reading
when
one
of
those
loud
nasal
blasts
so
peculiar
to
the
gaul
resounded
at
the
gate
and
another
not
responsible
entered
more
excited
if
possible
than
the
first
several
minutes
were
spent
in
exchanging
fierce
sentiments
and
slapping
the
palm
of
the
left
hand
rapidly
with
the
back
of
the
right
presently
there
was
a
pause
for
breath
alphonse
proceed
to
read
said
the
general
sitting
up
in
bed
de
ticket
began
alphonse
but
a
third
rapping
at
the
gate
interrupted
him
and
a
third
irresponsible
their
number
talking
loudly
and
wildly
to
the
as
he
came
up
the
hall
finally
alphonse
read
the
article
little
by
little
the
incensed
gentlemen
gave
it
a
hearing
now
two
words
and
now
three
interrupting
it
to
rip
out
long
rasping
maledictions
and
wag
their
forefingers
at
each
other
as
they
strode
ferociously
about
the
apartment
as
alphonse
reached
the
close
and
dashed
the
paper
to
the
floor
the
whole
quartet
in
terrific
unison
cried
for
the
blood
of
the
editor
but
hereupon
the
general
spoke
with
authority
no
messieurs
he
said
buttoning
his
savagely
you
shall
not
fight
him
i
forbid
it
you
shall
not
but
cried
the
three
at
once
one
of
us
must
fight
and
you
you
can
not
if
fight
our
cause
is
lost
the
candidate
must
not
fight
messieurs
cried
the
hero
beating
his
breast
and
lifting
his
eyes
au
i
have
a
son
yes
my
beloved
friends
a
son
who
shall
call
the
villain
out
and
make
him
pay
for
his
impudence
with
blood
or
eat
his
words
in
morning
paper
heaven
be
thanked
that
gave
me
a
son
for
this
occasion
i
shall
see
him
at
once
as
soon
as
i
can
dress
we
will
go
with
you
no
gentlemen
let
me
see
my
son
alone
i
can
meet
you
at
maspero
in
two
hours
adieu
my
dear
friends
he
was
resolved
revoir
said
the
dear
friends
shortly
after
cane
in
hand
general
villivicencio
moved
with
an
ireful
stride
up
the
of
rue
royale
just
as
he
passed
the
front
one
of
the
batten
shutters
opened
the
faintest
bit
and
a
certain
pair
of
lovely
eyes
looked
after
him
without
any
of
that
round
simplicity
which
we
have
before
discovered
in
them
as
he
half
turned
to
knock
at
his
son
door
he
glanced
at
this
very
shutter
but
it
was
as
tightly
closed
as
though
the
house
were
an
enchanted
palace
mossy
door
on
the
contrary
swung
ajar
when
he
knocked
and
the
general
entered
well
my
son
have
you
seen
that
newspaper
no
i
think
not
i
you
have
not
since
your
cheeks
are
not
red
with
shame
and
anger
mossy
looked
up
with
astonishment
from
the
desk
where
he
sat
writing
what
is
that
papa
my
faith
mossy
is
it
possible
you
have
not
heard
of
the
attack
upon
me
which
has
surprised
and
exasperated
the
city
this
morning
no
said
mossy
with
still
greater
surprise
and
laying
his
hand
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
his
father
put
on
a
dying
look
my
soul
at
that
moment
his
glance
fell
upon
the
paper
which
had
been
sent
in
by
madame
délicieuse
but
mossy
my
son
he
screamed
it
is
striking
it
rapidly
with
one
finger
there
there
there
read
it
it
calls
me
responsible
responsible
it
calls
me
read
read
but
papa
said
the
quiet
little
doctor
rising
and
accepting
the
crumpled
paper
thrust
at
him
i
have
read
this
if
this
is
it
well
then
already
i
am
preparing
to
respond
to
it
the
general
seized
him
violently
and
spreading
a
suffocating
kiss
on
his
face
sealed
it
with
an
affectionate
oath
ah
mossy
my
boy
you
are
glorious
you
had
begun
already
to
write
you
are
glorious
read
to
me
what
you
have
written
my
son
the
doctor
took
up
a
bit
of
manuscript
and
resuming
his
chair
began
messrs
editors

your
journal
of
this
morning
eh

not
written

english

said
the
general
but

it
is
necessary

your
journal
of
this
morning

editorial
article
upon

and
abundant
with
mistakes
who

the
author
or
writer
of
the
above
said
editorial
article
your
correspondent
does
at
present
ignore
but
doubts

he
is
one
who
hasty
to
form
an
opinion
will
yet
however
make
his
assent
to
the
correction
of
some
errors
and
mistakes
which
bah
cried
the
general
mossy
looked
up
blushing
crimson
bah
cried
the
general
still
more
forcibly
bêtise
how
asked

gentle
son

the
general
bursting
into
english
hall

mon
père
et
ses
amis
said
mossy
in
a
tone
of
derision
and
anger
his
father
gazed
at
him
in
mute
astonishment
he
stood
beside
his
disorderly
little
desk
his
small
form
drawn
up
a
hand
thrust
into
his
breast
and
that
look
of
invincibility
in
his
eyes
such
as
blue
eyes
sometimes
surprise
us
with
you
want
me
to
fight
he
said
my
faith
gasped
the
general
loosening
in
all
his
joints
i
believe
you
may
cut
me
in
pieces
if
i
do
not
believe
you
were
going
to
reason
it
out
in
the
newspaper
fight
if
i
want
you
to
fight
upon
my
soul
i
believe
you
do
not
want
to
fight
no
said
mossy
my
god
whispered
the
general
his
heart
seemed
to
break
yes
said
the
steadily
gazing
doctor
his
lips
trembling
as
he
opened
them
yes
your
god
i
am
afraid
afraid
gasped
the
general
yes
rang
out
the
doctor
afraid
afraid
god
forbid
that
i
should
not
be
afraid
but
i
will
tell
you
what
i
do
not
fear
i
do
not
fear
to
call
your
affairs
of
honor
murder
my
son
cried
the
father
i
retract
cried
the
son
consider
it
unsaid
i
will
never
reproach
my
father
it
is
well
said
the
father
i
was
wrong
it
is
my
quarrel
i
go
to
settle
it
myself
mossy
moved
quickly
between
his
father
and
the
door
general
villivicencio
stood
before
him
utterly
bowed
down
what
will
you
sadly
demanded
the
old
man
papa
said
the
son
with
much
tenderness
i
can
not
permit
you
fifteen
years
we
were
strangers
and
yesterday
were
friends
you
must
not
leave
me
so
i
will
even
settle
this
quarrel
for
you
you
must
let
me
i
am
pledged
to
your
service
the
little
doctor
did
not
mean
to
settle
but
to
adjust
he
felt
in
an
instant
that
he
was
misunderstood
yet
as
quiet
people
are
apt
to
do
though
not
wishing
to
deceive
he
let
the
misinterpretation
stand
in
his
embarrassment
he
did
not
know
with
absolute
certainty
what
he
should
do
himself
the
father
face
he
thought
of
but
one
way
to
settle
a
quarrel
began
instantly
to
brighten
i
would
myself
do
it
he
said
apologetically
but
my
friends
forbid
it
and
so
do
i
said
the
doctor
but
i
will
go
myself
now
and
will
not
return
until
all
is
finished
give
me
the
paper
my
son
i
do
not
wish
to
compel
you
there
was
something
acid
in
the
doctor
smile
as
he
answered
no
but
give
me
the
paper
if
you
please
the
general
handed
it
papa
said
the
son
you
must
wait
here
for
my
return
but
i
have
an
appointment
at
maspero
at
i
will
call
and
make
excuse
for
you
said
the
son
well
consented
the
almost
happy
father
go
my
son
i
will
stay
but
if
some
of
your
sick
shall
call
sit
quiet
said
the
son
they
will
think
no
one
is
here
and
the
general
noticed
that
the
dust
lay
so
thick
on
the
panes
that
a
person
outside
would
have
to
put
his
face
close
to
the
glass
to
see
within
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
the
doctor
had
reached
the
newspaper
office
thrice
addressed
himself
to
the
wrong
person
finally
found
the
courteous
editor
and
easily
convinced
him
that
his
father
had
been
imposed
upon
but
when
mossy
went
farther
and
asked
which
one
of
the
talented
editorial
staff
had
written
the
article
you
see
doctor
said
the
editor
just
step
into
my
private
office
a
moment
they
went
in
together
the
next
minute
saw
mossy
departing
hurriedly
from
the
place
while
the
editor
complacently
resumed
his
pen
assured
that
he
would
not
return
general
villivicencio
sat
and
waited
among
the
serpents
and
innocents
his
spirits
began
to
droop
again
revolving
mossy
words
he
could
not
escape
the
fear
that
possibly
after
all
his
son
might
compromise
the
villivicencio
honor
in
the
interests
of
peace
not
that
he
preferred
to
put
his
son
life
in
jeopardy
he
would
not
object
to
an
adjustment
provided
the
enemy
should
beg
for
it
but
if
not
whom
would
his
son
select
to
perform
those
friendly
offices
indispensable
in
polite
quarrels
some
some
spectacled
he
suffered
the
monotony
of
his
passive
task
was
relieved
by
one
or
two
callers
who
had
the
sagacity
or
bad
manners
to
peer
through
the
dirty
glass
and
then
open
the
door
to
whom
half
rising
from
his
chair
he
answered
with
a
polite
smile
that
the
doctor
was
out
nor
could
he
say
how
long
he
might
be
absent
still
the
time
dragged
painfully
and
he
began
at
length
to
wonder
why
mossy
did
not
return
there
came
a
rap
at
the
glass
door
different
from
all
the
raps
that
had
forerun
it
a
fearless
but
gentle
dignified
graceful
rap
and
the
general
before
he
looked
round
felt
in
all
his
veins
that
it
came
from
the
young
madame
yes
there
was
her
glorious
outline
thrown
side
wise
upon
the
glass
he
hastened
and
threw
open
the
door
bending
low
at
the
same
instant
and
extending
his
hand
she
extended
hers
also
but
not
to
take
his
with
a
calm
dexterity
that
took
the
general
breath
she
reached
between
him
and
the
door
and
closed
it
what
is
the
matter
anxiously
asked
the
general
for
her
face
in
spite
of
its
smile
was
severe
general
she
began
ignoring
his
inquiry
and
with
all
her
creole
bows
smiles
and
insinuating
phrases
the
severity
of
her
countenance
but
partially
waned
i
came
to
see
my
physician
your
son
ah
general
when
i
find
you
reconciled
to
your
son
it
makes
me
think
i
am
in
heaven
you
will
let
me
say
so
you
will
not
be
offended
with
the
old
playmate
of
your
son
she
gave
him
no
time
to
answer
he
is
out
i
think
is
he
not
but
i
am
glad
of
it
it
gives
us
occasion
to
rejoice
together
over
his
many
merits
for
you
know
general
in
all
the
years
of
your
estrangement
mossy
had
no
friend
like
myself
i
am
proud
to
tell
you
so
now
is
it
not
so
the
general
was
so
taken
aback
that
when
he
had
thanked
her
in
a
mechanical
way
he
could
say
nothing
else
she
seemed
to
fall
for
a
little
while
into
a
sad
meditation
that
embarrassed
him
beyond
measure
but
as
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
she
resumed
nobody
knew
him
so
well
as
i
though
i
poor
me
i
could
not
altogether
understand
him
for
look
you
general
he
was
what
do
you
think
great
nothing
less
how
asked
the
general
not
knowing
what
else
to
respond
you
never
dreamed
of
that
eh
continued
the
lady
but
of
course
not
nobody
did
but
me
some
of
those
américains
i
suppose
knew
it
but
who
would
ever
ask
them
here
in
royal
street
in
new
orleans
where
we
people
know
nothing
and
care
nothing
but
for
meat
drink
and
pleasure
he
was
only
mossy
who
gave
pills
my
faith
general
no
wonder
you
were
disappointed
in
your
son
for
you
thought
the
same
ah
yes
you
did
but
why
did
you
not
ask
me
his
old
playmate
i
knew
better
i
could
have
told
you
how
your
little
son
stood
head
and
shoulders
above
the
crowd
i
could
have
told
you
some
things
too
wonderful
to
believe
i
could
have
told
you
that
his
name
was
known
and
honored
in
the
scientific
schools
of
paris
of
london
of
germany
yes
i
could
have
shown
you
she
warmed
as
she
proceeded
i
could
have
shown
you
letters
i
begged
them
of
him
written
as
between
brother
and
brother
from
the
foremost
men
of
science
and
discovery
she
stood
up
her
eyes
flashing
with
excitement
but
why
did
you
never
tell
me
cried
the
general
he
never
would
allow
me
but
you
why
did
you
not
ask
me
i
will
tell
you
you
were
too
proud
to
mention
your
son
but
he
had
pride
to
match
yours
ha
achieving
all
every
thing
with
an
assumed
name
me
tell
your
father
i
implored
him
but
him
find
me
out
he
said
and
you
never
found
him
out
ah
there
he
was
fine
he
would
not
he
said
though
only
for
your
sake
your
affections
as
any
thing
more
or
less
than
just
your
son
ha
and
so
she
went
on
twenty
times
the
old
general
was
astonished
anew
twenty
times
was
angry
or
alarmed
enough
to
cry
out
but
twenty
times
she
would
not
be
interrupted
once
he
attempted
to
laugh
but
again
her
hand
commanded
silence
behold
monsieur
all
these
dusty
specimens
these
revolting
fragments
how
have
you
blushed
to
know
that
our
idle
people
laugh
in
their
sleeves
at
these
things
how
have
you
blushed
and
you
his
father
but
why
did
you
not
ask
me
i
could
have
told
you
your
son
is
not
an
apothecary
not
one
of
these
ugly
things
but
has
helped
him
on
in
the
glorious
path
of
discovery
discovery
general
your
son
known
in
europe
as
a
scientific
discoverer
the
blind
people
say
is
that
that
general
villivicencio
should
be
dissatisfied
with
his
son
he
is
a
good
man
and
a
good
doctor
only
a
little
careless
that
all
but
were
more
blind
still
for
you
shut
your
eyes
tight
like
this
when
had
you
searched
for
his
virtues
as
you
did
for
his
faults
you
too
might
have
known
before
it
was
too
late
what
nobility
what
beauty
what
strength
were
in
the
character
of
your
poor
poor
son
just
heaven
madame
you
shall
not
speak
of
my
son
as
of
one
dead
and
buried
but
if
you
have
some
bad
news
your
son
took
your
quarrel
on
his
hands
eh
i
believe
so
i
think
well
i
saw
him
an
hour
ago
in
search
of
your
slanderer
he
must
find
him
said
the
general
plucking
up
but
if
the
search
is
already
over
slowly
responded
madame
the
father
looked
one
instant
in
her
face
then
rose
with
an
exclamation
where
is
my
son
what
has
happened
do
you
think
i
am
a
child
to
be
trifled
with
a
horse
to
be
teased
tell
me
of
my
son
madame
was
stricken
with
genuine
anguish
take
your
chair
she
begged
wait
listen
take
your
chair
never
cried
the
general
i
am
going
to
find
my
son
my
god
madame
you
have
this
what
are
you
that
you
should
treat
me
so
give
me
this
instant
oh
monsieur
i
beseech
you
to
take
your
chair
and
i
will
tell
you
all
you
can
do
nothing
now
listen
suppose
you
should
rush
out
and
find
that
your
son
had
played
the
coward
at
last
sit
down
and
ah
madame
this
is
play
cried
the
distracted
man
but
no
it
is
not
play
sit
down
i
want
to
ask
you
something
he
sank
down
and
she
stood
over
him
anguish
and
triumph
strangely
mingled
in
her
beautiful
face
general
tell
me
true
did
you
not
force
this
quarrel
into
your
hand
i
he
would
not
choose
to
have
it
did
you
not
do
it
to
test
his
courage
because
all
these
fifteen
years
you
have
made
yourself
a
fool
with
the
fear
that
he
became
a
student
only
to
escape
being
a
soldier
did
you
not
her
eyes
looked
him
through
and
through
and
if
i
did
demanded
he
with
faint
defiance
yes
and
if
he
has
made
dreadful
haste
and
proved
his
courage
asked
she
well
then
the
general
straightened
up
triumphantly
then
he
is
my
son
he
beat
the
desk
and
heir
to
your
wealth
for
example
certainly
the
lady
bowed
in
solemn
mockery
it
will
make
him
a
magnificent
funeral
the
father
bounded
up
and
stood
speechless
trembling
from
head
to
foot
madame
looked
straight
in
his
eye
your
son
has
met
the
writer
of
that
article
where
the
old
man
lips
tried
to
ask
suddenly
unexpectedly
in
a
my
god
and
the
villain
lives
cried
madame
he
rushed
to
the
door
forgetting
that
it
was
locked
give
me
that
key
he
cried
wrenched
at
the
knob
turned
away
bewildered
turned
again
toward
it
and
again
away
and
at
every
step
and
turn
he
cried
oh
my
son
my
son
i
have
killed
my
son
oh
mossy
my
son
my
little
boy
oh
my
son
my
son
madame
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
sobbed
aloud
then
the
father
hushed
his
cries
and
stood
for
a
moment
before
her
give
me
the
key
clarisse
let
me
go
she
rose
and
laid
her
face
on
his
shoulder
what
is
it
clarisse
asked
he
your
son
and
i
were
ten
years
betrothed
oh
my
child
because
being
disinherited
he
would
not
be
me
husband
alas
would
to
god
i
had
known
it
oh
mossy
my
son
oh
monsieur
cried
the
lady
clasping
her
hands
forgive
me
mourn
no
more
your
son
is
unharmed
i
wrote
the
article
i
am
your
recanting
slanderer
your
son
is
hunting
for
me
now
i
told
my
aunt
to
misdirect
him
i
slipped
by
him
unseen
in
the
the
wild
old
general
having
already
staggered
back
and
rushed
forward
again
would
have
seized
her
in
his
arms
had
not
the
little
doctor
himself
at
that
instant
violently
rattled
the
door
and
shook
his
finger
at
them
playfully
as
he
peered
through
the
glass
behold
said
madame
attempting
a
smile
open
to
your
son
here
is
the
key
she
sank
into
a
chair
father
and
son
leaped
into
each
other
arms
then
turned
to
madame
ah
thou
lovely
she
had
fainted
away
ah
well
keep
out
of
the
way
if
you
please
papa
said
mossy
as
madame
presently
reopened
her
eyes
no
wonder
you
fainted
you
have
finished
some
hard
work
see
here
no
clarisse
dear
take
this
father
and
son
stood
side
by
side
tenderly
regarding
her
as
she
revived
now
papa
you
may
kiss
her
she
is
quite
herself
again
already
my
daughter
said
the
stately
general
this
is
my
son
ransom
and
with
this
i
withdraw
the
villivicencio
ticket
you
shall
not
exclaimed
the
laughing
lady
throwing
her
arms
about
his
neck
but
yes
he
insisted
my
faith
you
will
at
least
allow
me
to
remove
my
dead
from
the
field
but
certainly
said
the
son
see
clarisse
here
is
madame
your
aunt
asking
us
all
into
the
house
let
us
go
the
group
passed
out
into
the
rue
royale
mossy
shutting
the
door
behind
them
the
sky
was
blue
the
air
was
soft
and
balmy
and
on
the
sweet
south
breeze
to
which
the
old
general
bared
his
grateful
brow
floated
a
ravishing
odor
of
ah
what
is
it
the
veteran
asked
of
the
younger
pair
seeing
the
little
aunt
glance
at
them
with
a
playful
smile
madame
délicieuse
for
almost
the
first
time
in
her
life
and
mossy
for
the
thousandth
blushed
it
was
the
odor
of
