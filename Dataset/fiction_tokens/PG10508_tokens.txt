chapters
some
of
sabrina
remarks
are
likely
to
cause
the
reader
to
elevate
his
eyebrows
in
suspicion
as
to
her
true
character
in
order
to
set
myself
right
with
both
the
public
and
the
vast
army
of
sabrinas
that
add
youth
and
beauty
to
our
stage
and
brilliancy
and
gaiety
to
our
well
known
cafes
i
wish
to
say
that
she
is
all
that
she
should
be
she
is
a
young
lady
who
no
matter
how
old
she
may
be
does
not
look
it
she
is
always
well
dressed
perhaps
a
little
in
advance
of
the
fashion
but
invariably
in
good
taste
among
strangers
or
in
public
places
her
conduct
is
all
that
could
be
desired
while
with
those
of
her
own
set
she
becomes
more
familiar
and
may
occasionally
lapse
into
slang
fate
may
compel
her
to
earn
her
own
living
or
she
may
receive
an
income
from
a
source
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
these
stories
any
person
without
the
circle
of
theatrical
or
newspaper
life
is
looked
upon
as
an
interloper
by
sabrina
and
treated
accordingly
hundreds
of
her
like
may
be
found
any
evening
after
the
theatre
in

cafes
and
restaurants
of
the
wiseacres
known
as
the
tenderloin
kenneth
mcgaffey

which
sabrina
rushes
on
the
scene
and
begins
to
discourse
breathlessly
on
theatrical
conditions
boobs
that
send
poetry
for
presents
the
tribulations
of
hunting
employment
and
the
outlook
for
a
new

dinner
chapter
one
ai
it
appalling
demanded
sabrina
the
show
girl
ai
it
appalling
the
way
the
show
game
has
gone
to
the
morgue
this
season
i
never
seen
nothing
like
it
since
i
been
in
the
business
and
while
i
ai
going
to
flash
no
family
bible
that
been
some
time
why
shows
that
were
making
money
if
they
played
to
dollars
on
the
day
just
naturally
died
me
you
know
i
was
hep
to
the
outlook
i
come
prancing
into
town
fresh
from
doing
stands
through
the
uncultured
west
we
did
bum
business
for
fair
but
shucks
there
five
dollars
worth
of
real
money
in
all
of
southern
kansas
at
no
time
salaries
huh
i
had
to
send
home
for
money
to
pay
my
fines
with
i
cavort
gaily
out
to
hunt
a
job
and
find
a
line
from
seymour
office
that
made
the
run
on
the
knickerbocker
trust
company
look
like
the
nightly
window
sale
of
evangelist
i
never
seen
so
many
of
my
friends
in
town
at
one
time
in
my
life
and
if
you
make
a
noise
like
a
anywhere
between
the
two
flatirons
you
liable
to
be
the
center
of
a
raging
mob
i
heard
it
breathed
that
all
the
theatrical
storehouses
in
town
were
playing
to
i
got
a
chance
to
shake
down
a
little
change
as
prima
donna
with
a
turkey
show
what
do
you
know
about
that
i
played
with
one
last
thanksgiving
and
excuse
these
tears
it
was
a
college
town
and
the
show
was
on
the
blink
said
the
manager
has
left
there
yet
oh
listerine
have
you
heard
the
news
alia
mcgraw
has
turned
poetess
you
know
she
always
was
peculiar
i
was
visiting
her
the
other
evening
in
her
dressing
room
when
she
declared
that
she
was
going
to
give
up
her
dramatic
art
and
go
to
painting
word
pictures
whatever
they
are
you
see
it
was
this
way
she
had
a
boob
on
her
staff
who
was
paying
her
his
devoted
attention
according
to
her
statistics
that
all
he
ever
did
pay
for
well
he
commenced
doing
advance
work
about
a
present
he
was
going
to
give
her
until
he
got
poor
alla
to
thinking
that
it
was
nothing
less
than
an
automobile
and
she
treated
him
accordingly
one
morning
a
messenger
boy
makes
his
entrance
into
the
flat
and
hands
her
a
book
can
you
beat
that
the
only
thing
that
kept
alia
from
foaming
at
the
mouth
was
because
she
was
combing
her
dutch
braid
it
the
book
was
called
a
rubaiyat
by
omar
quinine
or
something
like
that
this
omar
party
never
wrote
a
comic
opera
in
his
life
but
alla
was
discouraged
for
she
looked
through
every
page
in
hopes
of
finding
a
clearing
house
certificate
but
not
a
leaf
stirred
all
she
came
across
was
a
marked
verse
that
went
something
like
this
a
book
of
verse
underneath
a
bough
a
jug
of
wine
a
loaf
of
bread
and
thou
beside
me
sitting
in
the
wilderness
oh
wilderness
is
paradise
enow
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
short
sport
wanted
to
buy
it
by
the
keg
and
go
sit
under
a
tree
in
bronx
park
as
soon
as
alla
run
out
of
language
she
sat
down
and
in
less
than
three
hours
doped
out
an
answer
i
got
it
here
on
the
back
of
her
laundry
list
a
book
of
verse
is
not
what
i
can
use
but
give
me
if
still
my
love
is
thine
a
wine
list
from
which
to
pick
and
choose
cut
out
the
shady
bough
for
mine
give
your
bough
to
some
nice
and
if
you
would
make
my
life
sublime
put
me
in
some
cool
rathskeller
and
we
forget
the
jug
of
wine
wine
in
a
jug
what
do
i
hear
not
with
a
loaf
of
bread
and
thou
a
cheese
sandwich
and
a
glass
of
beer
unless
you
changed
your
brand
ere
now
this
sitting
in
the
wilderness
may
be
fine
for
those
who
the
realms
of
nature
seek
a
restaurant
is
at
least
a
paradise
divine
with
payday
on
the
first
of
every
week
i
guess
maybe
that
wo
show
him
up
ai
it
just
glorious
kinda
wabbly
on
its
feet
but
just
think
it
her
first
attempt
she
said
there
were
a
lot
more
things
she
could
say
but
even
her
desire
to
be
a
poetess
would
let
her
forget
that
she
was
a
lady
alla
told
me
that
the
height
of
her
ambition
was
to
write
the
words
of
a
popular
song
and
have
harry
von
seltzer
sing
it
in
the
college
inn
she
ca
ever
make
a
hit
as
a
poem
producer
though
she
has
got
high
cheek
bones
and
teeth
like
a
squirrel
alla
was
pensive
all
through
the
first
act
and
while
she
was
making
her
change
from
a
to
a
bathing
girl
she
remarked
that
she
was
going
to
write
an
ode
past
tense
of
i
o
u
i
guess
entitled
on
hearing
ben
teal
conduct
a
chorus
rehearsal
they
wo
let
her
publish
it
what
do
you
know
about
the
new
law
about
tanks
having
to
have
their
names
on
the
barroom
door
i
see
where
the
metropole
will
lose
money
unless
they
furnish
disguises
to
their
steady
customers
can
you
imagine
the
suspense
certain
parties
will
feel
when
they
rush
into
a
shop
for
their
early
morning
mop
and
have
to
cling
to
the
bar
while
arthur
looks
up
their
past
performances
in
bingham
bartenders
guide
a
gentleman
friend
had
the
kindness
to
extend
me
courtesies
to
witching
hour
the
other
evening
and
listen
to
muh
there
is
some
class
to
that
show
ai
you
seen
it
it
a
song
and
dance
about
this
mental
telepathy
gag
there
is
a
gambling
gentleman
who
can
tell
a
poker
hand
every
time
the
only
reason
he
ai
a
heiress
is
because
his
conscience
jumps
up
and
gives
him
a
kick
in
the
face
this
party
in
the
play
influences
people
minds
he
thinks
of
something
and
people
miles
away
think
of
the
same
thing
all
the
same
wireless
take
it
from
me
a
whole
lot
to
it
at
that
i
was
out
with
a
kind
friend
the
other
evening
whose
general
disposition
is
to
try
and
make
frank
daniels
look
like
a
spendthrift
so
i
knew
it
would
be
beer
for
mine
unless
i
made
a
great
mental
effort
so
all
the
way
up
the
street
in
the
taxicab
i
just
held
thumbs
and
concentrated
my
mind
i
saw
more
new
style
hats
too
and
said
to
myself
heaven
sake
order
wine
loosen
up
and
order
wine
all
to
myself
you
understand
never
once
out
loud
for
though
i
am
in
the
business
i
do
seek
the
reputation
as
a
working
girl
well
i
hope
i
may
never
look
a
lobster
in
the
face
again
no
i
am
not
speaking
of
this
party
but
i
hope
i
may
never
look
a
lobster
in
the
face
again
if
he
did
swell
all
up
prance
into
the
eat
hut
and
say
careless
like
over
his
shoulder
to
the
waiter
bottle
of
that
brut
just
like
that
i
tried
the
concentration
gag
on
him
for
a
pearl
ring
he
had
on
thinking
i
had
him
under
the
gypsy
curse
but
there
was
a
person
who
had
the
nerve
to
call
herself
a
lady
who
had
been
saying
things
about
me
sitting
at
another
table
with
a
harry
who
had
led
me
to
believe
that
i
was
his
own
little
star
of
hope
and
i
just
could
get
my
mind
centered
honest
to
goodness
i
do
know
what
i
do
unless
i
find
work
my
suite
of
apartments
is
reduced
now
to
one
hall
room
and
a
closet
and
the
dennett
child
circuit
is
beginning
to
look
like
booking
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
for
me
to
do
is
to
get
engaged
and
hock
the
betrothal
ring
for
a
meal
ticket
me
for
roller
skates
here
i
been
hunting
a
job
until
i
wore
out
two
pair
of
these
sorosis
things
and
not
a
bush
shakes
ca
even
sign
a
contract
for
a
friday
night
amateur
contest
by
gum
i
take
a
job
barking
for
a
snake
race
i
had
an
offer
to
go
into
vaudeville
what
do
you
know
about
that
the
act
has
any
time
yet
but
it
will
get
time
as
soon
as
it
makes
good
and
to
make
good
all
its
needs
is
a
trial
performance
and
the
backer
thinks
he
knows
where
he
can
get
a
trial
performance
and
to
get
ready
for
the
trial
performance
will
require
about
five
weeks
rehearsal
at
nix
per
week
do
you
think
a
stunt
like
that
is
worthy
of
my
attention
adversity
does
sure
land
on
the
poor
chorus
doll
with
both
feet
at
every
stage
of
the
game
i
was
reading
in
the
paper
the
other
day
that
some
old
pappy
guy
out
in
chi
was
making
a
noisy
fuss
that
the
chorus
ladies
stay
up
too
late
nights
i
wish
somebody
would
show
him
to
me
that
all
i
ask
just
show
him
to
me
i
suppose
old
pink
whiskers
was
a
chorus
man
once
himself
and
has
got
all
the
dope
on
the
subject
so
we
stay
up
late
do
we
i
suppose
he
will
be
wanting
us
to
read
helpful
books
instead
of
making
up
next
to
my
mind
of
course
i
may
be
wrong
but
to
my
mind
the
staying
up
late
nights
ai
half
as
bad
as
getting
up
in
the
morning
of
course
i
do
know
who
or
what
this
old
wop
is
that
made
this
crack
but
if
he
thinks
we
spend
most
of
our
time
in
sinful
idleness
he
better
copper
his
bet
all
we
do
is
rehearse
all
morning
matinee
all
afternoon
performance
all
evening
and
travel
all
night
the
rest
of
the
time
we
have
to
ourselves
and
he
thinks
we
frivol
why
he
ai
wise
to
half
the
privations
they
force
on
us
would
you
believe
it
i
have
gone
forty
weeks
without
never
even
catching
a
glimpse
of
broadway
and
once
went
for
ten
without
even
a
cheese
sandwich
to
bring
gladness
to
my
heart
can
you
beat
that
and
then
he
goes
and
turns
loose
a
rebel
yell
because
when
we
do
get
a
little
time
to
ourselves
we
stay
up
late
nights
oh
mellen
food
when
does
he
want
us
to
stay
up
mornings
some
wise
boy
once
said
to
bed
early
to
rise
but
you
do
meet
any
prominent
people
and
i
guess
maybe
he
was
right
he
got
the
number
then
all
right
all
right
and
he
did
have
to
speak
harsh
to
central
at
that
we
got
ta
do
something
to
amuse
ourselves
and
i
never
had
a
traveling
gentleman
yet
conduct
me
to
a
watch
meeting
a
girl
comes
out
of
the
stage
door
tired
and
lonesome
some
village
prances
out
and
gets
acquainted
the
girl
is
hungry
so
why
not
perhaps
she
is
sending
money
home
every
week
and
ca
afford
a
little
lunch
after
the
show
herself
no
that
no
taproom
jest
there
is
more
than
one
of
the
putting
her
little
sister
through
school
and
do
you
forget
it
for
a
minute
and
he
gets
sore
because
we
stay
up
late
nights
he
better
roll
another
pill
get
at
the
cause
and
then
hang
the
curfew
on
a
few
of
those
town
romps
if
he
hands
out
another
song
and
dance
number
like
that
again
send
him
up
to
me
i
give
him
a
bunch
of
inside
info
that
will
make
him
think
something
broke
loose
i
managed
to
slip
in
and
see
talk
of
new
york
the
other
night
say
that
a
great
play
did
you
get
wise
to
the
way
that
kid
burns
party
juggles
the
loose
talk
i
do
believe
there
ever
was
a
party
that
slings
slang
the
way
that
guy
does
my
mother
was
always
particular
about
my
bringing
up
and
if
i
ever
passed
out
any
of
this
george
cohan
style
of
repartee
she
would
give
me
a
slap
on
the
map
and
tell
me
to
chase
back
and
handle
my
harangue
as
per
webster
so
though
i
have
traveled
about
a
bit
i
still
retain
my
pure
english
even
when
i
lose
my
temper
which
is
going
some
for
a
lady
what
am
i
going
to
do
new
year
i
know
one
thing
i
ai
going
to
play
an
encore
to
the
sozzle
session
number
i
pulled
off
last
season
did
you
hear
about
it
evidently
you
were
not
on
broadway
last
new
year
eve
a
couple
of
young
ladies
and
myself
were
playing
a
progressive
hell
party
all
up
and
down
the
main
street
you
see
you
play
it
this
way
a
guy
comes
up
and
blows
a
horn
in
your
ear
you
swat
the
horn
quickly
on
the
end
with
your
hand
if
the
guy
swallows
more
than
half
the
horn
you
win
and
are
allowed
to
for
the
ambulance
but
that
was
only
a
prelude
to
the
main
event
ah
me
i
blush
to
chronicle
it
there
were
so
many
shows
in
town
that
the
supply
of
college
students
did
come
up
to
the
demand
and
as
me
and
the
bunch
had
sorta
turned
them
down
after
they
went
and
lost
all
their
money
on
the
thanksgiving
game
so
we
had
an
intimation
that
developed
into
a
hunch
that
our
little
mat
on
the
doorstep
would
not
be
crowded
with
an
eager
throng
we
engaged
a
couple
of
window
tables
at
the
cafe
des
beaux
minks
realizing
that
though
we
were
not
in
the
money
we
were
still
on
the
track
this
was
last
new
year
eve
new
year
afternoon
we
held
a
reception
up
at
miss
verneaque
flat
took
up
a
collection
for
the
widows
and
orphans
and
cleared
apiece
on
it
the
place
got
pinched
and
we
all
had
to
hide
on
the
roof
until
the
cops
beat
it
but
not
for
me
this
year
me
for
the
peaceful
kind
of
a
celebration
i
know
what
to
do
the
only
people
i
have
on
my
calling
list
now
are
the
agents
and
they
will
all
be
home
splashing
in
the
gee
but
i
wish
i
was
home
was
you
ever
in
a
country
town
on
a
new
year
day
say
list
sixty
laughs
in
sixty
minutes
looks
like
a
busy
day
at
the
morgue
compared
to
the
laughs
they
hand
out
in
one
of
those
stand
dumps
the
sons
of
temperance
all
go
out
and
get
a
bun
on
ad
lib
and
everybody
inhales
good
cheer
i
sang
in
the
choir
honest
i
did
but
it
did
take
i
got
a
silver
cigarette
case
yet
the
choirmaster
gave
me
but
no
home
this
year
me
to
the
cafe
des
enfants
what
will
i
do
make
such
a
foolish
noise
i
be
there
with
my
hair
in
a
braid
at
hector
say
you
got
the
good
samaritan
looking
like
a
rent
collector
so
long
in
which
sabrina
discloses
a
little
of
her
past
and
those
of
the
members
of
the
company
tells
how
she
was
a
bridesmaid
and
goes
into
detail
in
regard
to
the
benefit
to
humanity
of
having
carrier
pigeons
trained
to
rush
the
growler
chapter
two
i
was
strolling
down
broadway
the
other
afternoon
with
oscar
when
we
happened
to
meet
miss
sabrina
the
show
girl
i
introduced
them
of
course
and
then
retired
to
the
background
this
is
what
followed
i
am
very
glad
to
meet
you
jenkins
i
heard
the
party
here
speak
of
you
yes
and
i
have
heard
him
say
several
nice
things
about
you
is
that
so
sure
but
do
take
it
to
heart
he
means
well
well
i
can
only
say
he
treats
me
like
a
true
friend
speaking
of
treats
i
buy
the
beer
my
goodness
ai
you
afraid
of
catching
cold
taking
so
much
money
out
of
your
clothes
all
at
once
what
was
that
you
handed
out
come
again
please
i
merely
remarked
that
it
was
awful
kind
of
you
oh
that
all
right
i
always
was
careless
with
my
money
i
always
like
this
place
it
reminds
me
so
much
of
the
back
of
the
drug
store
in
emporia
then
you
are
from
the
west
miss
de
vear
oh
yes
indeed
i
a
western
girl
pure
and
simple
you
said
and
simple
did
you
not
i
most
certainly
did
and
i
like
to
see
the
party
that
got
anything
on
me
i
come
from
a
dead
swell
family
i
do
i
may
be
only
a
poor
chorus
girl
but
by
gosh
i
was
brung
up
right
did
you
know
that
i
was
featured
for
three
seasons
in
the
church
choir
in
my
home
town
and
would
have
had
it
for
life
if
the
stage
manag
i
mean
the
choirmaster
forgot
he
was
a
gentleman
so
i
just
quit
rather
than
cause
talk
why
would
you
believe
it
my
father
was
mayor
of
emporia
for
nearly
two
terms
you
be
surprised
if
i
told
you
my
real
name
and
some
of
the
people
i
am
related
to
say
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
book
trying
to
dope
out
whether
you
can
buy
another
drink
i
suppose
no
i
just
keeping
track
of
the
girls
i
met
whose
fathers
are
mayors
of
towns
i
got
for
providence
fifteen
for
peoria
ten
for
atlanta
and
your
two
makes
seven
for
emporia
got
for
chief
of
police
fire
captains
and
eleven
postmas
excuse
me
but
are
you
trying
to
infer
that
i
am
telling
an
untruth
oh
forget
it
ca
you
stand
a
little
jolly
without
going
up
in
the
air
well
i
accept
your
apology
but
i
do
like
to
have
people
casting
slurs
on
my
pa
and
ma
and
beer
wont
appease
my
wrath
when
i
feel
like
a
highball
go
as
far
as
you
like
i
was
only
ordering
what
i
thought
you
were
accustomed
to
say
percival
b
fresh
you
certainly
are
the
village
wag
when
it
comes
to
the
oriental
repartee
ai
you
sure
i
am
but
i
have
to
go
to
the
mat
when
they
commence
to
dish
out
this
emporia
humor
oh
laza
do
you
care
for
the
one
in
red
of
course
i
may
go
wrong
but
in
my
mind
no
gentleman
would
make
remarks
about
another
girl
when
he
is
with
a
lady
say
girlie
you
all
right
lovely
hair
beautiful
eyes
and
all
that
but
cut
it
drop
in
your
penny
and
get
wise
to
yourself
that
a
great
show
you
are
with
when
was
you
out
front
night
before
last
night
before
last
my
heavens
was
i
a
sight
you
know
the
girl
i
dress
with
had
been
out
to
a
wine
supper
and
she
came
splashing
into
the
dressing
room
lit
up
like
a
show
window
and
cried
my
makeup
box
full
of
tears
over
the
death
of
her
baby
sister
and
the
way
i
had
to
put
it
on
i
thought
was
sure
good
for
a
fine
and
to
make
matters
worse
some
hussy
got
next
to
all
my
toothpicks
and
i
had
to
use
a
hairpin
for
a
liner
but
did
you
notice
the
way
that
cat
of
a
soubrette
keeps
me
out
of
the
spotlight
professional
jealousy
that
all
but
it
do
do
me
no
good
to
kick
because
the
stage
manager
sends
her
silk
stockings
and
that
kind
of
junk
while
the
best
i
get
is
a
chance
to
hold
hands
with
the
electrician
but
of
course
he
gets
his
orders
say
that
piece
of
work
that
stands
on
the
end
opposite
you
is
all
to
the
berries
ai
she
her
surest
thing
you
know
she
looks
like
a
pippin
to
me
my
gracious
jenkins
i
never
knocked
a
living
soul
but
i
mind
telling
you
as
a
friend
that
i
personally
would
not
degrade
myself
by
speaking
to
her
and
of
course
you
know
that
the
hair
she
wears
is
not
her
own
i
have
a
thing
in
the
world
against
the
poor
creature
but
it
has
been
breathed
around
the
company
that
she
is
not
all
she
should
be
of
course
i
do
know
positively
but
it
is
what
everybody
says
and
i
only
wish
she
would
make
good
with
that
four
bits
of
mine
well
i
glad
there
no
hard
feeling
between
you
two
as
i
would
like
to
meet
her
i
very
sorry
but
you
will
have
to
pardon
me
if
i
refuse
to
give
you
a
knockdown
for
i
would
steer
no
friend
of
a
friend
of
mine
up
against
a
flim
flam
where
there
so
many
nice
girls
running
loose
take
tessie
samonies
for
example
she
ai
very
pretty
but
she
awfully
cute
and
after
she
gets
a
couple
of
sloe
gins
boosted
into
her
she
certainly
is
the
life
of
the
party
all
right
frame
it
up
for
me
and
i
open
wine
or
a
window
or
something
to
show
that
i
a
true
sport
you
bet
i
will
and
we
have
a
nice
little
family
party
no
knocking
or
nothing
just
sit
and
talk
real
friendly
like
that
the
idea
and
if
anyone
starts
the
anvil
chorus
they
get
the
skiddo
what
who
will
we
have
well
let
see
we
have
tessie
and
you
me
and
silent
murphy
here
and
let
see
who
else
joe
zeweibaum
and
miss
veronique
not
yet
joe
is
all
right
in
a
crowd
if
you
can
keep
him
from
talking
about
his
sales
but
the
dame
not
for
me
for
if
there
any
one
gets
my
goat
she
it
shall
we
have
frank
millar
and
his
first
wife
oh
heavings
no
for
if
we
did
his
third
wife
would
hear
about
it
and
then
she
would
knock
me
to
my
husband
for
you
know
they
are
engaged
so
if
she
hears
anything
about
me
you
can
bet
she
plays
it
up
strong
well
ca
you
think
of
some
one
else
no
i
do
know
a
soul
that
is
any
good
but
us
four
my
goodness
got
to
roll
my
hoop
and
do
a
shopping
number
get
my
hair
gargled
i
slept
in
it
last
night
and
see
a
sick
friend
fate
sure
does
sic
tribulations
on
me
at
every
turn
of
the
road
this
business
of
hunting
employment
has
got
to
be
so
balmy
that
i
snort
and
jump
sideways
every
time
anybody
says
now
that
the
first
of
the
year
has
kicked
in
i
thought
everything
would
be
as
merry
as
a
marriage
bell
but
as
yet
there
has
been
a
ripple
on
the
water
the
only
thing
that
acts
as
a
star
of
hope
to
my
miserable
existence
is
a
date
with
a
summer
stock
that
opens
the
first
of
june
and
there
is
a
heap
of
smoke
around
that
i
wish
some
one
would
tip
me
off
to
some
way
of
earning
an
honest
living
without
having
to
resort
to
a
sock
full
of
sand
or
a
strong
arm
but
why
be
downhearted
i
have
drunk
up
all
my
christmas
presents
yet
as
a
last
hope
i
can
load
upon
them
and
get
some
kind
ambulance
to
drag
me
up
to
the
dippy
department
of
some
nice
hospital
honest
i
am
getting
so
thin
that
before
long
i
wo
be
able
to
understudy
a
drop
of
water
in
hippodrome
a
nice
gentleman
presented
himself
to
me
on
broadway
the
other
evening
and
after
passing
the
compliments
of
the
season
invited
me
out
to
inhale
a
young
table
the
way
i
sprang
to
his
side
made
a
leap
for
life
seem
like
sinful
idleness
and
where
do
you
think
he
took
me
i
ask
as
a
friend
where
do
you
think
he
took
me
to
one
of
those
joints
where
you
get
everything
from
soup
to
nuts
including
a
scuttle
full
of
red
ink
for
scudi
i
was
going
to
balk
and
rear
in
the
harness
when
he
started
to
lead
me
up
the
steps
of
the
foundry
but
as
i
always
maintained
discretion
is
the
better
part
of
valor
i
ahead
anyway
you
play
it
so
i
climb
into
the
nosebag
without
a
peep
yet
would
you
believe
it
when
that
wop
came
to
cash
in
he
shook
the
mothballs
out
of
a
roll
of
bills
that
looked
like
nine
miles
worth
of
hall
carpet
i
had
been
acting
very
reserved
heretofore
but
when
he
made
this
flash
he
commenced
to
look
like
a
very
dear
friend
of
mine
who
had
been
very
kind
to
me
in
moments
of
adversity
i
apprised
him
of
the
fact
and
the
dog
had
the
temerity
to
pin
his
pocket
shut
with
a
safety
pin
right
before
my
eyes
i
come
to
find
out
later
that
he
was
a
press
agent
ai
it
scandalous
the
way
the
friars
wine
and
dine
the
dramatists
every
few
weeks
i
tried
to
agitate
a
bunch
for
the
chorus
girls
to
give
a
dinner
to
ben
teal
or
william
seymour
but
while
they
were
all
willing
to
be
in
on
the
big
eat
the
way
they
ducked
the
financial
responsibilities
would
have
made
you
think
it
was
a
clause
the
other
day
i
put
my
ear
to
the
ground
and
then
cavorted
madly
around
to
savage
office
to
see
if
there
was
anything
doing
in
the
widow
line
the
handsome
gentleman
on
the
other
side
of
the
desk
allowed
a
ripple
of
merriment
to
float
over
his
features
and
then
spake
as
follows
we
got
to
do
is
to
toll
the
bell
in
the
old
church
tower
and
nine
companies
will
answer
like
the
fire
department
you
know
i
could
have
gone
with
the
paris
of
pilson
company
but
those
french
gentlemen
are
so
emotional
one
tried
to
bite
my
ear
in
the
other
night
did
i
tell
you
about
mamie
de
vere
becoming
a
bride
again
she
believes
in
marrying
at
leisure
and
divorcing
in
haste
the
justice
of
the
peace
that
always
ties
her
nuptial
knot
told
her
that
if
she
bought
a
ticket
she
could
save
cents
per
wedding
and
he
would
hand
it
to
the
happy
bridegroom
as
her
dowry
well
anyway
they
got
maried
after
the
show
so
that
she
would
loose
her
job
i
was
maid
of
honor
honest
i
was
do
it
sound
funny
and
i
carried
her
bouquet
as
the
bridal
party
marched
up
the
hall
to
the
office
of
the
justice
of
the
peace
just
as
he
was
about
to
pronounce
the
last
sad
rites
a
started
playing
get
married
any
more
ma
with
variations
well
it
made
mamie
so
nervous
you
know
she
always
was
a
hysterical
creature
it
made
her
so
nervous
that
she
had
to
have
wilbur
that
her
husband
go
out
and
put
a
bug
on
the
ginny
before
she
would
allow
the
flag
to
drop
then
we
went
out
and
had
our
wedding
breakfast
there
were
six
or
eight
in
the
crowd
i
do
rightly
remember
which
for
sometimes
there
would
be
only
a
few
and
then
again
it
would
be
a
turbid
throng
a
couple
of
whisky
sales
gentlemen
joined
our
little
gathering
and
proposed
a
race
you
know
i
do
so
love
athletic
sports
i
do
mean
prize
fighters
or
ball
players
but
feats
of
strength
the
whisky
gentlemen
had
a
little
the
best
start
for
they
had
been
running
trial
heats
the
way
we
staged
that
drinking
number
was
a
crime
how
we
ended
up
i
care
not
neither
do
i
spin
i
can
merely
state
that
mamie
and
i
slid
for
home
in
a
taxicab
leaving
wilbur
saying
things
to
the
head
waiter
that
no
lady
would
listen
to
oh
say
are
you
here
with
any
extra
junk
no
this
ai
no
touch
but
if
you
have
got
a
reckless
bundle
i
know
how
you
can
double
it
in
a
few
weeks
a
gentleman
friend
of
mine
was
captain
of
a
fake
game
until
he
got
put
out
of
business
by
the
hard
times
and
the
lack
of
suckers
synonymous
he
is
selling
stock
of
a
proposition
that
has
anything
from
goldfield
chased
back
to
the
desert
this
is
the
scheme
listerine
he
going
to
train
carrier
pigeons
to
rush
the
growler
the
chorus
girls
union
have
already
elected
him
an
honorary
you
see
he
gets
these
birds
and
trains
them
to
carry
the
pail
in
their
teeth
and
smell
out
the
nearest
saloon
even
a
blind
tiger
no
matter
where
they
are
then
he
rents
the
birds
out
by
the
dozen
to
the
theatrical
organizations
special
rates
to
musical
comedies
so
that
all
the
poor
has
to
do
if
there
is
no
gentleman
without
is
get
a
bird
from
the
property
man
beat
it
for
the
furnished
room
drop
ten
cents
in
the
bucket
write
a
little
note
to
the
bartender
merely
stating
has
company
so
not
so
much
foam
please
open
the
window
and
start
the
dove
of
peace
on
its
mission
of
happiness
you
need
be
afraid
of
the
pigeon
sneaking
up
an
alley
and
drinking
half
of
it
and
then
coming
back
with
the
stall
boss
is
on
tonight
there
ai
no
bellhop
to
tip
and
all
the
bird
wants
is
three
or
four
grains
of
corn
mother
and
its
just
as
happy
and
care
free
as
if
you
opened
wine
wo
that
be
a
boon
to
humanity
though
if
he
do
get
a
carnegie
medal
things
are
run
wrong
another
stunt
he
is
going
to
pull
off
is
canned
cheese
sandwiches
well
i
got
to
toddle
along
the
ladies
auxiliary
to
the
anvil
chorus
is
going
to
hold
a
meeting
in
alla
sweenie
apartments
was
you
ever
one
of
them
well
when
those
dames
get
on
the
job
and
are
grouped
it
makes
elinor
glyn
opinion
of
the
pilgrim
mothers
seem
like
words
of
praise
so
long
in
which
sabrina
receives
money
from
an
unexpected
source
and
brings
to
light
how
she
came
to
receive
it
and
what
she
intends
doing
when
the
entire
sum
is
given
her
chapter
three
providence
has
got
to
throw
something
besides
some
time
or
other
remarked
sabrina
the
show
girl
as
we
complimented
her
upon
her
new
gown
and
i
guess
i
am
there
with
rings
on
my
fingers
and
bells
on
my
toes
or
words
to
that
effect
take
me
by
the
hand
and
lead
me
to
some
secluded
nook
and
i
will
unburden
my
young
soul
when
we
had
seated
ourselves
and
the
waiter
had
retired
for
the
second
time
she
began
you
have
been
hearing
me
put
up
a
plaintive
plea
about
being
on
the
rocks
well
i
was
i
had
everything
in
hock
but
my
and
i
had
that
ready
to
tuck
under
my
shawl
at
a
moment
notice
and
rush
off
to
uncle
sim
but
never
again
for
muh
i
was
up
in
my
suite
wondering
if
i
could
sign
checks
at
child
when
the
landlady
shoved
a
letter
under
my
door
she
could
have
shoved
a
dog
under
just
as
well
as
not
i
dive
for
the
epistle
thinking
perhaps
it
is
some
word
of
encouragement
from
matt
grau
i
tear
open
the
envelope
and
pull
out
a
letter
and
out
drops
a
piece
of
paper
that
could
look
like
it
meant
money
it
a
cinch
i
beat
it
to
the
floor
it
was
a
check
i
staggered
against
the
gas
stove
i
was
so
surprised
then
i
unfolded
it
and
it
was
made
out
to
me
can
you
beat
that
to
me
and
in
my
real
name
for
one
hundred
count
one
hundred
cold
hard
clearing
house
certificates
the
only
thing
that
kept
me
from
having
a
scene
with
myself
was
the
fact
that
i
had
drank
up
all
my
merry
yuletide
gifts
well
by
and
by
after
piping
off
the
check
counting
it
biting
it
smelling
it
i
had
sense
enough
to
look
at
the
letter
this
is
going
to
be
a
long
sad
tale
so
you
had
better
yes
that
it
a
little
more
of
the
same
you
see
it
was
this
way
last
season
when
i
thank
goodness
when
i
was
with
a
broadway
production
instead
of
a
road
show
a
certain
party
whom
i
had
met
while
out
on
the
stands
the
season
before
came
stampeding
into
town
and
it
fell
upon
my
fair
young
shoulders
to
show
him
the
sights
query
did
i
show
him
the
sights
answer
yes
i
did
show
him
the
sights
if
there
was
any
place
we
did
see
it
was
because
you
had
to
have
an
introduction
to
get
in
then
edward
became
inoculated
with
an
idea
that
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
consume
all
the
booze
on
broadway
thereby
preventing
others
from
living
intemperate
lives
such
a
chance
you
know
the
new
tunnel
could
hold
the
reserve
supply
of
liquids
that
can
report
for
duty
at
a
minute
notice
on
the
corner
of
and
broadway
the
first
time
i
got
hep
to
those
proceedings
was
when
i
received
the
glad
tidings
over
the
phone
from
a
hospital
steward
that
a
friend
of
mine
was
trying
to
bite
holes
in
the
detention
sheet
and
shrieking
my
name
i
grabbed
a
book
on
animals
i
have
met
and
flew
to
the
rescue
when
i
got
to
the
cot
there
was
edward
cherubic
mug
peeping
out
from
under
about
four
miles
of
nice
clean
bandages
and
an
attendant
sitting
daintily
on
his
chest
when
he
saw
me
he
calmed
down
and
dismissed
the
menagerie
for
the
nonce
he
said
taking
my
shrinking
little
hand
in
his
was
awful
it
only
by
mere
chance
that
you
find
me
custodian
of
this
reptile
bazar
instead
of
one
of
these
mangled
remains
things
it
was
this
way
i
had
been
down
to
the
bar
lapping
up
a
few
drinks
and
pretty
soon
a
band
comes
up
the
street
i
go
out
to
look
it
over
and
there
is
nothing
in
sight
so
i
go
back
and
get
arthur
to
mix
me
up
another
to
see
if
it
wo
make
me
feel
better
i
drink
that
and
hear
the
band
again
i
run
out
just
in
time
to
see
it
hiding
behind
the
post
it
bum
harmony
at
that
so
i
go
upstairs
to
take
a
nap
lying
there
on
the
bed
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
door
opens
and
in
marches
twelve
little
soldiers
about
six
inches
high
dressed
in
blue
pants
and
red
coats
they
climb
and
start
to
pull
off
a
zouave
drill
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
that
made
me
sour
for
i
do
feel
like
a
military
pageant
so
i
lift
up
my
foot
and
kick
them
out
on
the
floor
the
soldiers
do
say
a
word
but
jump
up
and
climb
out
through
the
transom
in
about
five
minutes
the
door
opens
and
in
marches
the
whole
army
all
about
six
inches
high
gee
there
must
have
been
a
million
of
them
for
all
i
could
see
was
blue
pants
and
red
coats
i
lying
there
on
the
bed
taking
it
all
in
when
up
rides
a
dinky
little
officer
on
a
horse
he
salutes
me
and
i
salute
him
just
to
let
them
know
that
there
was
any
hard
feeling
then
he
says
i
am
glad
to
state
that
you
have
but
one
life
to
lose
for
your
country
therefore
we
are
going
to
shoot
you
well
you
know
me
dearie
i
jumped
out
of
the
window
the
next
time
i
come
out
of
it
here
is
this
guy
doing
snake
charming
stunts
on
my
stomach
can
you
beat
that
for
a
pipe
i
look
after
this
party
with
all
the
loving
care
of
a
sister
and
thanks
to
the
doctor
and
a
pump
we
pulled
him
through
when
he
was
able
to
be
shipped
home
i
went
down
to
the
train
to
see
him
off
and
as
he
kissed
me
goodby
he
said
you
worry
kid
i
wo
forget
this
i
did
pay
any
attention
to
his
chatter
thinking
it
nothing
but
balloon
juice
but
this
letter
says
that
he
died
about
a
week
ago
and
left
ten
thousand
to
me
in
such
a
way
that
it
wo
do
his
wife
no
good
to
yelp
ten
thousand
gee
ai
that
an
awful
huge
lot
of
money
for
one
poor
little
to
be
burdened
with
the
lawyers
sent
that
first
hundred
along
to
show
that
they
are
not
pikers
and
said
that
the
rest
would
be
along
in
a
few
days
gosh
i
wo
know
what
to
do
with
it
i
ca
get
that
much
in
my
little
lisle
thread
bank
without
spoiling
the
contour
of
that
new
gown
effect
i
am
going
to
be
poured
into
clothes
well
i
should
hope
so
dear
when
the
true
meaning
of
that
effusion
soaked
into
my
system
the
way
i
grabbed
my
hat
and
took
it
on
the
run
for
the
dressmaker
was
a
caution
to
cab
horses
i
going
to
get
a
bunch
of
clothes
and
then
slide
for
home
you
know
my
father
was
mayor
of
emporia
for
nearly
a
whole
term
and
i
can
go
right
back
into
society
that
is
a
great
burg
if
anybody
wears
anything
but
a
mother
hubbard
on
week
days
they
are
doped
out
as
a
actress
sure
that
the
way
they
know
that
there
a
show
in
town
that
and
the
band
that
town
will
have
nothing
but
the
best
if
a
show
is
good
enough
to
hare
a
band
it
might
as
well
cancel
it
a
great
show
town
all
right
sometimes
they
have
two
shows
there
the
same
week
lynne
and
something
else
the
boston
store
has
the
progress
on
the
recent
fiction
counter
well
i
must
rush
right
along
i
got
to
go
over
to
some
place
and
get
a
mile
or
two
of
those
puff
gags
mine
are
all
moth
eaten
i
got
some
more
things
to
buy
and
then
i
am
going
around
and
make
faces
at
all
these
theatrical
agents
bye
bye
in
which
sabrina
receives
the
balance
of
the
fortune
says
farewell
to
the
hall
secures
more
imposing
quarters
a
french
maid
an
automobile
and
other
accessories
as
befitting
her
station
chapter
four
i
got
adversity
laying
on
her
back
and
purring
with
contentment
remarked
sabrina
the
show
girl
as
she
stepped
out
of
a
taxicab
in
front
of
a
cafe
and
i
guess
she
stand
hitched
for
a
few
minutes
tell
my
driver
to
wait
and
then
come
in
and
have
a
little
liquid
nourishment
this
is
the
only
place
i
can
find
where
one
can
get
any
kind
of
service
my
ai
i
getting
fussy
here
weeks
ago
coffee
and
were
a
banquet
but
why
dig
up
the
past
and
i
reiterate
the
remark
the
dead
bury
its
dead
if
anybody
mentions
mink
to
me
i
am
liable
to
throw
a
foaming
fit
and
fall
in
it
every
time
i
pass
a
bread
line
i
am
filled
with
sorrow
for
the
poor
unfortunates
while
heretofore
i
got
sore
because
they
had
beaten
me
to
it
sure
the
lawyer
guy
kicked
in
with
the
balance
of
the
ten
thousand
and
i
am
now
busily
engaged
in
putting
it
where
it
will
do
the
most
good
moved
well
i
should
hope
so
dear
instead
of
existing
in
a
hallroom
with
an
airshaft
exposure
where
you
have
to
open
the
door
to
think
i
am
now
residing
in
a
real
suite
maybe
you
think
i
do
keep
estelle
that
my
maid
on
the
job
she
the
busy
proposition
about
that
dump
as
soon
as
i
come
out
of
my
beauty
sleep
in
the
morning
i
ring
the
bell
and
in
capers
estelle
with
a
dipperful
of
chocolate
which
i
sip
while
reclining
on
my
couch
and
you
can
take
it
from
me
it
got
this
stunt
of
romping
about
a
cold
room
in
a
canton
flannel
kimona
trifling
with
the
affections
of
a
gas
stove
beat
to
a
purple
pulp
then
after
reading
the
morning
paper
i
arise
take
a
bawth
and
estelle
does
my
hair
that
is
she
does
part
of
it
i
ca
bear
any
one
teeth
but
my
own
on
my
dutch
braid
you
know
some
people
are
sensitive
that
after
the
hair
dressing
number
i
inhale
about
worth
of
breakfast
and
then
lounge
about
my
little
nest
i
call
it
my
little
nest
because
it
is
finished
in
birdseye
maple
i
always
have
eggs
for
breakfast
and
estelle
puts
on
the
finishing
touches
with
a
feather
duster
and
i
boss
the
job
smoking
a
cigarette
i
always
was
strong
for
having
things
harmonize
i
suppose
it
is
my
artistic
temperament
i
always
drink
cordials
the
same
color
as
my
hat
after
that
everything
is
fixed
to
my
entire
satisfaction
and
i
wo
stand
for
cigarette
butts
being
kicked
under
the
bed
either
i
that
particular
then
about
noon
the
dressmaker
makes
her
entrance
and
i
pick
out
my
gowns
clothes
say
when
i
line
out
of
here
for
that
dear
emporia
i
have
to
buy
tickets
so
as
i
can
get
a
baggage
car
free
i
need
it
from
the
apparel
i
am
purchasing
you
think
i
was
wardrobe
mistress
for
a
number
two
of
new
york
company
if
i
do
make
those
canned
goods
drummers
in
front
of
the
palace
hotel
think
there
is
something
in
town
besides
a
show
i
hope
i
never
see
broadway
again
then
along
toward
afternoon
i
climb
into
some
chic
frock
get
that
and
taxey
down
here
to
look
things
over
say
maybe
you
think
this
butterfly
existence
is
all
to
the
berries
the
other
evening
i
kicked
down
to
a
show
i
once
worked
in
and
believe
me
if
some
of
those
dames
knew
what
they
looked
like
from
the
front
they
certainly
would
rush
out
and
hide
in
the
cow
lot
honest
there
is
one
doll
who
thinks
she
has
got
every
prize
beauty
in
the
country
biting
her
finger
nails
with
jealousy
well
she
came
out
led
out
at
that
i
nearly
dropped
dead
in
my
seat
you
know
that
i
am
not
a
knocker
and
there
is
nothing
i
hate
worse
than
to
hear
one
lady
pan
another
behind
her
back
so
i
will
merely
make
this
statement
if
this
person
would
stop
trying
to
use
up
all
the
number
in
the
block
would
get
operated
on
for
have
her
face
changed
and
stop
trying
to
be
a
very
dear
friend
to
the
whole
department
during
the
opening
chorus
she
be
all
right
and
might
get
a
job
with
a
medicine
show
i
know
how
she
keeps
her
job
all
right
all
right
i
ai
mentioning
any
names
but
a
certain
party
old
enough
to
be
her
grandfather
had
to
put
money
into
the
show
before
they
would
even
let
her
have
her
voice
tried
i
was
out
to
dinner
with
the
same
crowd
that
she
was
with
the
other
evening
arthur
and
i
were
sitting
at
the
table
in
the
restaurant
waiting
for
the
rest
of
the
crowd
when
in
she
canters
dressed
up
regardless
like
a
queen
in
a
book
in
a
gag
she
run
a
bluff
as
if
she
just
had
it
made
but
if
a
certain
wardrobe
mistress
ever
catches
her
with
it
on
this
party
is
due
to
get
pinched
for
petty
larceny
as
soon
as
she
spotted
me
she
rushed
over
and
yelped
sabrina
i
charmed
to
see
you
and
kissed
me
the
cat
then
she
said
i
understand
you
have
inherited
a
fortune
and
raised
her
eyebrows
just
like
that
now
i
had
been
kidded
enough
about
that
legacy
of
mine
and
when
that
doll
that
ai
such
a
muchness
herself
commences
to
hand
out
inferences
i
naturally
lost
my
goat
but
remembering
that
i
am
now
a
lady
i
let
go
of
my
hatpin
and
merely
remarked
but
i
came
by
it
honestly
and
i
can
safely
say
that
i
am
no
foxy
grandpa
child
that
terse
remark
made
her
sit
up
and
take
notice
for
she
had
been
telling
one
of
the
members
of
the
party
who
she
was
trying
to
make
a
hit
with
that
she
got
her
money
from
her
large
estates
in
england
the
only
thing
she
knows
about
england
she
learned
at
a
burton
holmes
lecture
that
she
got
into
on
a
ticket
she
found
in
the
subway
the
gentlemen
of
the
party
called
time
and
we
sat
down
to
the
table
she
started
putting
on
airs
and
telling
what
she
knew
about
the
thaw
trial
so
to
let
her
know
that
i
was
right
there
i
passed
out
this
one
a
cinch
if
anybody
did
any
shooting
to
save
your
life
he
get
the
chair
the
first
throw
out
of
the
box
and
the
jury
wo
be
out
any
longer
than
it
takes
to
get
their
hats
either
say
if
she
had
had
a
gun
she
have
shot
me
one
of
the
gentlemen
remarked
to
me
care
for
this
young
lady
do
you
i
said
i
like
her
i
like
her
about
as
much
as
bingham
likes
jerome
this
female
party
started
to
drinking
champagne
as
if
it
were
suds
so
naturally
it
was
long
before
she
got
a
snootful
and
one
of
these
crying
kind
all
the
party
began
to
kid
her
until
at
last
she
sobbed
there
is
always
one
place
i
can
go
to
where
i
am
welcome
one
of
the
guys
said
dearie
i
know
it
but
it
is
after
now
and
that
place
is
closed
then
little
bright
eyes
beat
it
and
we
all
had
a
real
nice
evening
after
that
oh
she
a
smooth
one
all
right
she
nearly
made
me
lose
my
job
once
if
it
had
been
that
the
stage
manager
was
carrying
my
suitcase
i
would
have
been
decorated
with
my
little
two
weeks
out
in
the
wilds
somewhere
you
see
it
was
this
way
we
had
a
tree
not
the
one
arthur
owned
but
another
and
one
of
the
comedians
had
to
stand
inside
of
it
for
about
fifteen
minutes
before
he
could
make
his
entrance
laughing
number
this
was
only
a
dinky
little
place
and
only
had
one
small
airhole
well
this
foxy
dame
stuffed
this
airhole
full
of
limberger
cheese
so
when
it
came
time
for
his
entrance
instead
of
coming
forth
blithe
and
gay
as
per
book
the
comedian
came
out
looking
as
if
he
had
apoplexy
the
same
naturally
causing
the
to
giggle
ad
lib
did
you
ever
see
a
wild
fish
honest
when
that
man
came
off
i
thought
he
was
going
to
commit
murder
what
he
said
on
the
subject
is
not
for
me
to
repeat
right
in
the
middle
of
the
harangue
this
dame
remarks
think
it
was
sabrina
the
next
think
she
thunk
was
to
wonder
who
let
go
of
the
asbestos
curtain
for
i
happened
to
overhear
that
and
bounced
a
on
her
think
tank
if
she
had
gone
on
again
that
night
it
would
have
been
in
a
wheeled
chair
another
stunt
she
did
was
to
put
lampblack
all
over
the
tenor
glove
and
he
wiped
it
off
on
the
shoulders
so
she
looked
like
a
zebra
in
a
bathing
suit
and
every
time
she
would
tell
the
firemen
when
the
chorus
men
were
getting
fresh
courage
by
smoking
cigarettes
in
their
dressing
rooms
but
that
is
all
over
now
and
my
stage
career
is
ended
until
i
spend
all
this
surplus
cash
i
take
it
on
the
run
for
that
dear
kansas
tomorrow
so
i
think
i
will
go
and
see
if
estelle
has
finished
packing
try
and
be
good
while
i
am
gone
and
if
anything
happens
for
goodness
sake
wire
me
for
out
in
that
neck
of
the
woods
even
paying
for
telegrams
from
new
york
is
a
pleasure
au
revoir
in
which
sabrina
makes
a
visit
to
her
parents
in
emporia
returns
after
but
a
brief
stay
and
chronicles
some
of
the
events
that
transpired
while
in
the
city
of
her
birth
chapter
five
kill
the
prodigal
the
calf
has
returned
cried
sabrina
the
show
girl
as
her
taxicab
drew
up
to
where
we
were
standing
thought
you
were
in
emporia
we
exclaimed
in
surprise
i
was
i
came
i
saw
i
conquered
or
whatever
whoever
said
it
did
jump
in
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
fine
business
i
had
more
exciting
events
than
ever
appeared
before
under
one
canvas
but
never
again
you
know
when
i
started
about
ten
days
ago
trouble
why
i
had
more
trouble
than
a
manager
with
nine
stars
and
one
good
dressing
room
and
i
had
to
leave
estelle
my
maid
here
at
that
i
tried
to
get
a
stateroom
but
nothing
doing
so
me
for
a
berth
with
the
common
herd
train
going
along
fine
about
in
the
morning
me
pounding
my
fair
young
ear
in
lower
six
when
all
of
a
sudden
biff
engine
slaps
a
cow
in
the
back
and
the
whole
works
deserts
the
track
and
the
caboose
i
in
slides
over
the
bank
turns
over
on
her
side
and
dies
lower
six
at
the
bottom
i
get
handed
the
following
one
suitcase
two
pairs
of
shoes
and
a
fat
hardware
salesman
from
upper
five
not
forgetting
my
womanly
rights
i
turn
loose
a
rebel
yell
and
start
to
climb
out
of
the
opposite
window
with
the
kind
assistance
of
the
arm
of
the
berth
the
face
of
the
fat
salesman
and
a
broken
window
appearing
as
the
pink
pajama
girl
on
the
side
of
the
car
that
was
at
that
time
understudying
the
roof
when
i
got
out
i
turned
loose
a
couple
more
whoops
on
the
clear
morning
air
just
to
let
them
know
that
i
was
still
on
the
job
and
took
a
casual
survey
of
the
disaster
naturally
our
car
was
the
goat
and
the
only
one
that
had
gone
wrong
the
fat
salesman
does
the
appearing
act
next
dragging
his
suitcase
waived
formality
and
asked
me
if
i
would
have
a
drink
me
for
the
drink
and
then
i
got
him
to
climb
back
down
and
rescue
the
rest
of
my
apparel
and
i
dressed
standing
up
there
on
the
side
of
the
car
much
to
the
edification
of
the
train
crew
that
were
not
busily
engaged
in
assuring
the
other
dames
in
the
car
that
they
were
not
dead
by
and
by
along
comes
another
train
and
they
load
us
all
in
and
we
get
to
chicago
only
about
four
hours
late
me
being
that
fatigued
i
rushed
right
up
to
the
sherman
house
but
there
was
a
room
vacant
on
the
top
floor
so
i
knew
i
would
not
feel
at
home
there
so
i
go
capering
over
to
the
annex
gee
but
that
chicago
is
a
bum
town
and
yet
in
emporia
they
look
upon
it
as
a
mecca
of
pleasure
the
only
pleasure
i
ever
got
there
was
trying
to
analyze
the
smells
from
the
stock
yards
they
do
eat
anything
in
chicago
but
chop
suey
did
you
ever
shoot
any
of
that
junk
into
your
system
them
can
have
it
that
likes
it
but
never
again
for
muh
you
get
it
in
a
little
dish
and
the
blooming
stuff
smells
as
if
it
was
some
relation
to
a
poultice
you
eat
it
and
then
go
home
and
chew
all
the
enamel
off
the
bed
no
i
do
know
what
it
is
made
of
if
i
did
i
would
eat
it
that
the
only
thing
chicago
is
good
for
chop
suey
and
smells
when
they
get
through
talking
about
the
world
fair
perhaps
they
will
think
up
some
new
form
of
amusement
i
met
a
wop
in
chicago
one
of
these
real
romantic
kind
that
only
grow
there
i
was
seated
in
a
secluded
corner
of
the
ladies
waiting
room
of
the
annex
and
he
came
up
and
asked
me
if
i
did
want
to
step
in
the
pompeian
room
and
hear
the
waters
of
the
fountain
lapping
up
against
the
marble
i
told
him
i
much
preferred
to
be
up
against
a
bottle
of
wine
and
do
the
lapping
myself
he
with
that
true
chicago
gallantry
said
me
first
i
want
to
a
friend
i
glad
i
did
hold
my
breath
while
he
was
gone
i
think
he
must
have
taken
a
surface
car
for
oak
park
those
chicago
are
the
true
sports
all
right
all
right
if
necessity
compels
them
to
buy
anything
stronger
than
beer
they
commence
to
look
sassy
at
the
waiter
and
talk
loud
chicago
is
sure
rightly
named
when
they
call
it
the
windy
city
you
just
ought
to
have
heard
the
line
of
jolly
some
of
those
boys
tried
to
hand
out
to
me
to
me
mind
you
to
me
they
must
have
thought
that
i
was
some
unsophisticated
young
ingenue
that
never
had
been
further
away
from
state
street
than
an
occasional
excursion
across
the
lake
to
joe
i
sloshed
around
town
for
a
couple
of
days
just
to
give
those
people
a
change
from
the
usual
run
of
randolph
street
romps
then
i
hit
the
hummer
for
bleeding
kansas
and
emporia
say
i
had
a
great
first
entrance
into
that
burg
and
nothing
else
but
a
crate
of
lemons
got
off
to
crab
the
act
when
i
climb
down
off
the
hurdle
behold
the
village
choir
right
there
on
the
job
to
see
the
train
come
in
the
arrival
of
the
train
notice
the
train
is
what
you
might
call
the
main
event
of
the
day
as
soon
as
the
village
yokels
saw
my
trunks
being
unloaded
they
all
did
the
grand
duck
for
the
theatre
to
strike
the
house
manager
thinking
it
was
a
show
i
had
tipped
my
mitt
to
the
folks
so
they
were
not
at
the
tank
to
give
me
the
parental
embrace
but
after
giving
the
necessary
instructions
to
the
baggage
man
i
climbed
into
the
palace
hotel
bus
and
romped
up
to
my
abode
business
of
weeping
on
neck
mother
wigwags
father
who
comes
over
from
the
grocery
store
where
he
is
electing
the
president
of
the
united
states
business
of
rejoicing
ad
lib
sister
comes
in
from
the
village
school
neighbors
kick
in
to
see
what
coming
off
entrance
of
trunks
gasps
of
surprise
by
populace
distribution
of
presents
by
muh
that
night
there
was
a
young
people
meeting
at
the
church
a
young
people
meeting
is
a
signal
for
every
old
dame
in
the
township
not
married
to
iron
out
her
white
silk
waist
and
take
it
on
the
run
for
the
tabernacle
after
the
usual
prelude
the
minister
got
up
and
said
would
like
a
few
words
from
sabrina
who
has
lately
returned
to
our
little
flock
from
the
busy
scenes
of
the
great
and
wicked
metropolis
i
had
to
get
up
and
hand
out
the
usual
stereotyped
and
mimeographed
stuff
about
being
glad
to
be
in
their
midst
once
again
and
it
did
my
heart
good
to
see
so
many
bright
and
shining
faces
etc
i
had
on
a
modest
little
frock
that
had
only
lanced
me
about
three
hundred
and
made
the
aurora
borallis
look
like
a
dark
night
so
that
the
admiring
public
would
overlook
any
bets
in
the
costume
line
i
enlivened
my
discourse
with
these
illustrated
song
gestures
every
move
a
picture
after
the
olio
the
busy
brigade
of
the
ladies
auxiliary
took
the
napkin
off
a
group
of
sandwiches
and
a
bath
tub
of
lemonade
and
we
all
had
an
awful
time
with
ourselves
cracking
rare
quips
me
the
center
of
an
admiring
throng
they
all
knew
i
was
an
actress
and
they
asked
me
to
act
you
know
the
extent
of
my
acting
a
champagne
dance
and
a
burlesque
on
the
widow
waltz
and
my
lines
are
limited
to
girls
here
comes
the
prince
now
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
therefore
i
ducked
the
request
to
exhibit
my
art
i
was
going
home
after
the
show
i
mean
entertainment
and
waldo
the
fellow
i
went
with
before
i
got
sense
enough
to
blow
the
burg
with
a
musical
comedy
waldo
started
to
walk
home
with
me
i
will
say
this
much
for
waldo
before
i
go
any
further
he
has
a
good
eye
for
the
future
even
though
he
is
working
in
a
grocery
store
waldo
and
i
were
walking
down
the
quiet
country
lane
he
telling
me
all
the
news
that
had
been
pulled
off
while
i
had
been
away
when
we
got
down
to
the
garden
gate
what
do
you
think
came
off
waldo
proposed
honest
he
proposed
just
like
that
waldo
intentions
were
sincere
but
his
work
was
lumpy
and
he
went
up
in
his
lines
a
couple
of
times
he
did
pass
it
out
half
as
strong
as
these
city
chaps
do
when
they
mean
it
i
instructed
waldo
to
can
his
chatter
and
forget
it
waldo
got
real
indignant
because
i
would
fly
with
him
and
tried
to
grab
me
now
i
had
been
prowling
about
new
york
alone
without
learning
how
to
take
care
of
myself
so
i
gave
him
the
heel
and
the
way
he
went
to
the
mat
was
a
caution
for
further
orders
waldo
was
a
nice
boy
but
he
was
rough
so
after
the
jolt
he
got
he
had
sense
enough
to
beat
it
say
i
had
an
awful
time
for
the
next
two
or
three
days
but
never
again
i
never
go
any
further
out
in
the
country
than
claremont
these
rural
districts
are
for
those
that
like
them
but
if
i
can
have
broadway
for
a
country
lane
you
wo
hear
a
peep
out
of
me
honest
when
i
see
a
car
with
street
crosstown
on
it
i
wanted
to
gallup
up
and
kiss
the
motorman
well
i
got
to
leave
you
here
will
tell
you
how
i
happened
to
leave
emporia
the
next
time
i
see
you
take
it
from
me
i
had
rather
be
a
shine
on
broadway
than
a
glare
anywhere
else
so
long
in
which
sabrina
chronicles
some
more
of
the
adventures
that
happened
to
her
while
visiting
her
parents
and
details
how
she
stood
the
town
on
edge
was
ejected
therefrom
and
the
remarks
she
made
on
the
subject
chapter
six
they
say
a
rolling
stone
gathers
no
moss
but
it
a
cinch
that
this
pebble
could
have
gathered
a
bunch
of
lemons
since
she
has
fallen
into
her
inheritance
if
she
had
but
listened
to
their
plaintive
plea
remarked
sabrina
the
show
girl
after
we
had
seated
ourselves
at
the
table
has
some
one
been
seeking
your
hand
in
marriage
she
was
asked
honest
there
are
more
dubs
around
this
town
who
had
rather
get
married
than
work
than
there
are
actors
on
broadway
now
i
have
had
three
proposals
since
i
have
been
back
one
of
marriage
i
told
them
all
that
i
preferred
to
live
a
la
carte
i
could
have
become
a
bride
in
emporia
if
i
had
but
said
the
word
i
did
tell
you
how
i
came
to
sneak
that
snare
did
i
you
know
i
went
out
there
with
the
intention
of
staying
a
month
surging
around
and
showing
the
village
belles
that
may
manton
was
the
only
authority
on
correct
dress
ten
days
was
my
limit
the
family
and
every
one
agreed
that
my
metropolitan
broadmindedness
was
too
much
of
a
strain
on
the
sense
of
morality
of
the
peasantry
as
it
were
no
nothing
of
the
slightest
consequence
nothing
that
would
have
caused
the
inhabitants
of
broadway
to
even
arch
their
eyebrows
all
i
did
was
to
inhale
a
snootful
and
go
out
with
a
friend
and
stand
the
thriving
little
village
of
emporia
up
on
end
and
tip
it
over
is
a
strange
tale
list
and
i
will
unfold
it
to
you
one
day
i
was
wafting
slowly
and
sedately
down
to
the
boston
store
for
my
mail
when
lo
and
behold
what
did
i
see
out
in
front
of
the
palace
hotel
but
an
automobile
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
looked
a
radiator
in
the
face
for
a
week
two
young
fellows
were
monkeying
around
the
machine
and
as
they
were
chaps
i
gave
them
the
furtive
glance
and
one
of
them
stopped
and
asked
me
if
he
had
been
introduced
to
me
in
the
harlem
casino
at
any
other
time
i
would
have
taken
his
remark
as
a
deep
insult
inferring
as
it
did
that
i
was
so
far
from
street
but
now
i
could
have
fell
on
his
neck
and
cried
with
joy
i
told
him
that
i
had
never
met
him
in
the
place
he
had
mentioned
but
to
let
it
go
at
that
and
if
he
even
knew
where
harlem
was
it
was
introduction
enough
come
to
find
out
they
were
making
a
trip
across
the
continent
and
had
stopped
there
to
get
a
little
gasolene
for
the
machine
we
talked
things
over
and
i
found
out
that
they
knew
several
people
i
did
and
anyway
they
were
from
new
york
and
that
helped
a
heap
they
were
going
to
leave
that
afternoon
but
i
prevailed
upon
them
to
stay
over
until
the
next
day
i
was
invited
into
the
hotel
for
dinner
and
we
opened
the
first
bottle
of
champagne
wine
as
they
say
out
west
that
had
been
opened
in
emporia
since
the
governor
went
through
in
truth
the
bottle
was
covered
with
specks
and
the
label
had
faded
so
you
could
hardly
read
it
but
when
the
cork
went
three
traveling
men
at
the
next
table
burst
into
tears
after
we
had
consumed
all
the
champagne
wine
they
had
in
the
snare
i
tipped
them
off
to
a
and
we
decided
to
ride
down
there
in
the
machine
and
then
go
for
a
little
tour
as
it
were
by
this
time
it
had
been
noised
through
the
city
that
some
one
had
taken
the
bottle
out
of
the
show
window
and
a
large
crowd
had
assembled
to
see
the
plutocrats
come
forth
we
capered
blithely
out
to
the
machine
climbed
in
and
hiked
for
the
blind
tiger
after
the
usual
red
tape
the
captain
sold
us
about
two
quarts
of
the
kind
that
makes
a
spit
in
a
bulldog
eye
anon
we
again
went
for
a
ride
and
i
am
here
to
state
that
the
way
we
breezed
through
that
village
made
the
proverbial
kansas
cyclone
look
as
if
it
was
running
on
crutches
the
inhabitants
that
did
duck
for
the
cellars
stood
on
the
plankwalk
and
made
rude
and
discomplimentary
remarks
some
rube
had
tipped
his
mitt
to
the
town
marshal
and
that
worthy
cluck
had
stretched
a
rope
from
the
blacksmith
shop
to
the
corner
of
the
livery
stable
so
naturally
we
had
to
pause
enter
marshal
with
business
of
making
a
pinch
after
filing
the
usual
protests
we
were
haled
before
the
magistrate
here
a
copy
of
the
testimony
marshal
judge
your
honor
these
prisoners
are
charged
with
defacing
landmarks
violating
the
pure
food
law
exceeding
the
speed
limit
and
disorderly
conduct
judge
your
honor
these
miscreants
defaced
our
landmarks
by
drinking
the
only
bottle
of
champagne
wine
that
has
ever
been
in
our
village
the
bottle
that
for
so
long
has
graced
the
window
of
our
leading
hotel
and
was
looked
on
with
pride
and
reverence
by
the
townspeople
a
bottle
that
has
been
cherished
for
generations
until
these
monsters
came
with
their
gold
and
purchased
same
they
violated
the
pure
food
law
by
drinking
said
bottle
of
champagne
which
has
been
proven
by
the
state
board
of
examiners
to
contain
per
cent
alcohol
the
aforesaid
prisoners
exceeded
the
speed
limit
by
rushing
through
our
quiet
streets
at
a
terrific
pace
to
the
danger
of
the
lives
and
limbs
of
our
wives
and
children
the
prisoners
at
the
bar
are
charged
with
disorderly
conduct
by
the
following
facts
they
emptied
said
bottle
of
champagne
which
was
reputed
to
hold
one
quart
that
bottle
of
said
wine
was
emptied
completely
which
is
proven
by
your
marshal
who
after
the
orgy
in
our
leading
hotel
did
approach
a
waiter
of
said
hotel
and
ask
for
a
taste
of
said
wine
but
upon
investigation
the
bottle
was
found
to
be
entirely
empty
the
aforesaid
bottle
contained
one
whole
quart
of
an
intoxicating
beverage
and
was
distributed
among
three
people
therefore
judge
your
honor
the
prisoners
must
have
been
intoxicated
and
therefore
disorderly
your
honor
the
prosecution
rests
its
case
judge
prisoners
step
to
the
bar
you
are
charged
with
ad
lib
what
have
you
to
say
before
sentence
is
passed
upon
you
prisoners
not
a
blamed
word
judge
i
find
the
prisoners
guilty
and
sentence
them
to
pay
a
fine
of
or
ten
days
in
the
city
prison
prisoners
gee
you
must
be
going
to
build
a
new
courthouse
judge
five
dollars
for
kidding
the
court
i
knew
those
fellows
could
stand
the
strain
of
the
fine
so
turning
my
back
in
maidenly
modesty
to
the
court
i
dug
down
in
the
bank
and
came
up
with
a
hundred
dollar
bill
the
first
one
ever
seen
in
emporia
i
tossed
it
carelessly
on
the
desk
remarking
it
out
of
that
you
could
have
knocked
the
court
eyes
off
with
a
club
i
do
think
he
ever
saw
that
much
money
in
one
group
before
in
his
life
the
clerk
of
the
court
grabbed
the
fund
and
did
a
rubber
into
the
family
safe
for
the
change
all
quiet
along
the
potomac
the
whole
blooming
city
did
have
change
for
a
century
note
can
you
beat
that
and
they
say
there
is
no
graft
in
kansas
they
had
to
go
over
to
the
speakeasy
for
a
change
what
do
you
know
about
that
a
court
of
a
prohibition
state
going
to
a
for
money
after
we
got
through
telling
the
court
what
he
reminded
us
of
and
what
he
looked
like
we
tripped
out
to
the
machine
and
climbed
on
board
and
started
out
again
we
rode
around
until
or
in
the
morning
and
i
got
to
bed
just
as
the
help
was
getting
out
to
do
the
chores
maybe
you
do
think
that
evening
amusement
caused
some
scandal
why
before
breakfast
the
entire
population
was
wise
to
the
fact
that
sabrina
the
pride
and
glory
of
the
village
was
out
drinking
liquor
and
playing
progressive
hell
with
a
couple
of
strange
gentlemen
if
you
want
anything
known
in
one
of
those
wopburgs
just
tell
it
to
the
butcher
it
got
a
town
crier
or
a
litho
threesheet
faded
mother
had
the
info
on
the
whole
game
before
she
got
the
curl
papers
out
of
her
hair
a
couple
of
the
ladies
auxiliary
to
the
herbert
killjoy
memorial
did
picket
duty
out
in
front
of
the
house
all
night
so
as
to
be
first
in
with
the
glad
tidings
they
galloped
up
like
sheridan
twenty
miles
away
the
killjoy
sisters
beat
it
and
i
was
just
assuring
mother
that
getting
pinched
was
considered
very
distingue
by
the
upper
crust
of
the
eastern
metropolis
when
in
prance
the
village
selectmen
followed
by
the
deacons
of
the
church
when
they
came
into
view
i
knew
the
bell
had
rung
on
sabrina
the
souse
they
all
came
in
looking
like
the
first
act
of
a
funeral
and
homer
jenkins
the
head
deaconorine
looked
real
solemn
and
said
regret
to
inform
you
that
we
have
found
it
our
painful
duty
to
dismiss
your
daughter
from
the
church
i
spoke
up
real
gay
like
and
said
as
far
as
you
like
i
never
was
a
commuter
anyway
the
selectmen
were
at
the
bat
next
and
the
main
guy
of
that
informed
father
that
i
would
have
to
be
put
under
bond
to
keep
the
peace
as
my
actions
of
yesterday
in
drinking
the
champagne
wine
had
caused
nine
of
the
village
to
get
stewed
on
rhinewine
and
seltzer
and
to
please
let
them
have
the
money
now
as
they
had
to
pay
the
salary
then
i
delivered
my
philippic
as
follows
you
dubs
think
you
are
going
to
shake
me
down
for
any
more
change
you
had
better
drop
in
your
penny
and
get
next
to
yourselves
nix
not
i
already
coughed
up
more
than
the
rest
of
the
entire
population
and
you
are
not
going
to
lance
me
for
any
more
just
because
i
got
a
bundle
you
good
people
you
got
big
feet
and
i
would
like
to
see
you
run
fast
now
beat
it
i
going
to
blow
the
burg
on
the
next
caboose
and
while
i
do
wish
you
any
bad
luck
i
hope
the
town
hall
burns
down
now
take
it
on
the
run
or
i
will
give
you
all
a
good
scolding
and
send
you
to
bed
and
the
funny
thing
about
it
is
they
slid
i
tell
the
folks
that
my
light
is
hid
under
a
bushel
in
emporia
grab
the
bus
and
here
i
am
and
nothing
short
of
an
explosion
will
make
me
leave
put
this
on
your
board
the
only
good
thing
about
these
hick
hamlets
is
they
remind
you
of
new
york
because
they
are
so
different
so
long
do
fall
down
the
elevator
shaft
in
which
sabrina
attends
a
ball
given
by
the
chorus
girls
union
and
frivols
extensively
in
the
vineyard
and
later
does
a
specialty
with
ice
skates
and
a
bottle
of
arnica
chapter
seven
all
work
and
no
play
makes
jack
a
dead
one
remarked
sabrina
the
show
girl
as
we
met
her
at
the
appointed
place
do
i
look
like
the
wreck
of
the
hesperus
honest
to
goodness
i
feel
like
nine
dollars
worth
of
dog
meat
hanging
out
of
a
hospital
window
was
you
at
the
ball
also
i
mean
did
you
attend
last
night
festivities
ah
me
the
joy
and
laughter
of
yesterday
is
sure
the
hangover
of
today
i
thought
i
would
caper
down
to
the
ball
last
night
and
just
see
how
the
other
half
lived
and
instead
of
being
a
mere
obtrusive
observer
i
developed
into
what
you
might
term
the
main
event
of
the
evening
you
see
it
was
this
way
the
chorus
girls
union
of
which
i
am
now
a
member
gave
a
ball
in
commemoration
of
the
event
of
the
mayor
vetoing
tim
sullivan
bill
about
women
smoking
in
public
it
was
instigated
by
the
for
a
day
girls
because
when
they
went
to
plead
before
the
aldermen
the
newspapers
forgot
to
mention
the
show
they
were
from
so
that
the
long
talk
did
do
the
press
agent
any
material
good
as
it
were
the
hall
was
tastily
decorated
with
pictures
of
the
aldermen
embellished
with
cigarette
butts
and
champagne
corks
by
the
way
if
you
see
smoke
coming
from
the
knickerbocker
theatre
building
do
turn
in
a
fire
alarm
for
it
is
just
the
friars
showing
their
good
feeling
by
trying
to
smoke
up
all
the
friar
cigars
and
cigarettes
in
town
all
of
our
set
was
there
and
numerous
telegrams
of
regret
were
read
from
the
road
companies
as
i
say
i
was
seated
quietly
in
a
rathskeller
listening
to
the
noise
when
one
of
the
young
ladies
inadvertently
remarked
that
there
was
to
be
big
doings
at
a
nearby
hall
and
suggested
that
as
she
was
selling
tickets
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
buy
some
and
go
and
look
the
affair
over
not
to
mingle
with
the
throng
but
merely
to
add
tone
to
the
event
that
listened
very
well
indeed
and
we
all
climbed
into
a
cabbage
and
vamped
over
we
managed
to
secure
a
box
and
were
seated
surveying
the
dancers
of
which
there
were
a
few
and
the
wine
agents
of
which
there
was
a
herd
until
one
of
the
said
agents
happened
to
spy
our
little
crowd
and
with
that
true
southern
gallantry
for
which
wine
agents
are
so
noted
he
sent
over
a
quart
bottle
for
each
one
of
the
party
but
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
forgot
to
include
glasses
so
rather
than
look
a
gift
horse
in
the
mouth
metaphorically
speaking
we
did
not
mention
the
oversight
and
contented
ourselves
with
drinking
out
of
the
bottles
in
true
democratic
spirit
did
you
ever
imbibe
tiffany
water
direct
from
its
native
heath
as
it
were
no
then
let
me
warn
you
from
that
lurking
pitfall
it
has
the
same
taste
but
the
effect
di
mi
the
effect
is
multiplied
by
six
all
of
a
sudden
i
became
inoculated
with
a
wild
desire
to
burst
forth
into
song
and
also
with
the
idea
that
when
it
came
to
tripping
the
light
fantastic
toe
i
had
genee
looking
like
the
first
lesson
in
a
course
with
that
hunch
in
mind
i
shook
the
rest
of
the
mob
and
descended
to
the
floor
accompanied
by
my
personal
press
agent
i
was
wearing
at
the
time
one
of
my
latest
importations
both
underneath
and
outside
when
the
band
for
the
nineteenth
time
struck
up
the
widow
waltz
by
permission
of
henry
savage
i
capered
out
upon
the
floor
where
much
to
the
edification
of
the
assembled
multitude
i
pulled
off
a
combination
of
the
widow
waltz
and
dance
of
the
seven
veils
that
will
be
the
talk
of
the
town
until
bingham
does
something
else
foolish
did
it
cause
excitement
well
say
if
it
been
for
the
kindness
of
a
friend
i
would
at
this
time
been
pacing
a
prison
corridor
in
striped
pajamas
honest
when
i
came
to
this
morning
and
estelle
that
my
maid
told
me
what
i
had
done
i
vowed
that
i
never
would
speak
to
a
wine
agent
again
for
i
was
just
that
mortified
after
me
remembering
to
be
a
lady
and
then
before
a
mob
to
kick
over
the
traces
and
crab
the
act
believe
me
every
time
i
see
an
advertisement
for
that
brand
of
wine
a
blush
mantles
my
cheeks
sure
i
can
blush
see
and
for
tears
it
just
like
turning
on
the
faucet
in
the
bath
tub
all
the
young
creatures
in
our
set
have
to
be
there
with
the
blush
of
modesty
and
the
tear
tank
for
in
the
heat
and
gayety
of
a
wine
party
when
some
one
springs
a
travelling
man
story
if
we
could
flash
a
flush
we
would
be
doped
out
as
being
brazen
hussies
and
tears
are
always
handy
either
for
the
police
the
landlord
or
an
ardent
suitor
the
modern
girl
has
to
be
equipped
for
any
emergency
like
a
hook
and
ladder
truck
but
here
i
am
giving
away
all
our
girlish
secrets
take
it
from
me
i
never
again
gallop
around
the
juniper
bowl
i
would
be
a
lush
worker
like
that
alla
mccune
for
another
legacy
she
just
started
the
habit
lately
she
thinks
it
stylish
sure
every
time
she
goes
out
with
a
crowd
that
drink
anything
stronger
than
beer
she
thinks
she
is
in
society
every
time
she
gets
a
snoot
full
she
falls
in
love
fact
my
such
a
scene
as
she
caused
in
the
hotel
the
other
evening
she
doped
it
out
this
way
she
was
all
alone
a
stormy
night
a
bottle
of
scotch
and
a
syphon
why
not
light
up
talk
about
your
great
white
way
why
she
had
it
looking
like
a
dark
alley
in
darkest
brooklyn
along
about
in
the
evening
a
gentleman
called
to
see
her
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
portal
alla
knew
that
she
had
at
last
met
her
soul
twin
she
was
hanging
on
to
the
table
at
the
time
and
when
she
let
go
to
embrace
him
instead
of
being
clasped
to
his
yearning
bosom
as
she
had
planned
her
knees
gave
away
and
she
skated
on
her
profile
across
the
divan
this
cluck
being
of
a
timid
nature
instead
of
running
for
the
ammonia
slammed
the
door
and
sprinted
for
the
elevator
alla
as
soon
as
the
door
closed
realized
that
she
had
been
jilted
and
resolving
not
to
be
canned
without
a
struggle
she
threw
on
her
pony
coat
over
her
kimono
and
pinning
her
hat
roguishly
over
one
ear
she
fled
the
snare
and
ran
down
eight
flights
of
steps
into
the
street
with
two
coon
bell
boys
after
her
she
turned
into
broadway
going
like
hose
no
with
her
kimono
streaming
to
the
breeze
and
ran
all
the
way
down
to
and
into
the
door
before
she
was
stopped
by
the
head
waiter
the
two
bell
boys
caught
up
and
loaded
her
into
a
cab
before
the
police
came
and
managed
to
get
her
back
up
to
the
hotel
though
the
fight
she
put
up
was
a
caution
wine
is
sure
a
mocker
and
scotch
highballs
is
fierce
i
heard
from
the
folks
in
emporia
the
other
day
and
they
are
still
talking
over
the
time
i
and
the
two
guys
in
the
automobile
pulled
off
the
minister
sprung
a
long
sermon
on
the
effects
of
strong
drink
on
the
young
and
the
emporia
wasp
you
know
they
did
call
it
the
bee
but
the
guy
that
bought
it
from
the
bee
people
renamed
it
the
wasp
because
he
got
stung
worse
than
any
bee
could
sting
the
emporia
wasp
came
out
with
a
long
editorial
about
the
profligate
rich
and
the
attic
debating
society
had
a
big
in
the
basement
of
the
church
on
the
subject
it
resolved
that
more
people
are
killed
by
strong
drink
than
by
hanging
all
this
had
such
a
moral
effect
on
the
young
that
the
soda
fountain
did
sell
a
claret
phosphate
for
three
weeks
after
and
the
ladies
aid
got
so
busy
over
azbe
lewis
the
town
drunkard
that
he
had
three
proposals
of
marriage
but
he
decided
to
take
the
lesser
of
the
evils
and
stick
to
drink
i
think
he
ai
such
a
dope
at
that
say
sniff
can
you
detect
the
low
plaintive
cry
of
an
arnica
bottle
i
am
learning
how
to
skate
yes
i
fell
for
it
fell
for
it
is
good
i
did
all
over
the
ice
you
see
it
was
this
way
i
was
up
to
a
tea
one
of
the
girls
gave
in
honor
of
the
judge
getting
a
divorce
from
his
wife
we
call
it
a
tea
because
there
was
any
there
we
were
all
sitting
around
panning
those
who
were
not
among
those
present
until
at
last
one
of
the
girls
who
did
dare
leave
till
the
party
broke
up
suggested
that
we
go
down
to
the
park
and
take
a
skate
the
hostess
was
real
nice
she
suggested
that
it
was
necessary
to
beat
it
clear
down
there
to
get
a
skate
as
she
had
some
in
the
house
and
if
we
drank
that
up
the
dutchman
on
the
corner
knew
she
was
good
for
any
amount
within
reason
but
we
did
mean
what
she
meant
so
we
departed
going
down
i
became
perhaps
a
little
too
excited
over
the
coming
event
and
went
to
some
length
to
inform
the
assembled
skirts
that
when
it
came
to
cutting
ice
i
not
seeking
to
boast
but
i
was
there
forte
and
such
pastimes
as
writing
names
or
doing
dutch
rolls
i
considered
rudimentary
in
the
skating
number
and
only
performed
by
the
immature
i
may
have
overestimated
my
ability
some
for
i
had
never
been
on
skates
before
in
my
life
but
i
no
piker
and
i
follow
that
old
principle
of
willing
to
try
anything
once
so
when
it
came
time
i
let
the
boy
put
the
skates
on
without
a
murmur
and
was
assisted
to
the
ice
by
about
six
or
eight
eager
hands
say
i
looked
out
at
the
gang
gliding
about
gave
the
signal
to
let
go
the
ropes
and
took
the
fatal
step
curtain
say
i
went
round
so
fast
both
skates
clinched
in
my
marcel
wave
would
you
believe
it
there
was
hardly
any
one
in
sight
when
i
started
falling
but
before
i
got
through
the
police
had
to
move
the
crowd
on
the
only
thing
i
could
do
gracefully
was
to
throw
a
faint
i
turned
one
loose
until
somebody
tried
to
force
a
glass
between
my
teeth
and
then
i
came
to
but
it
was
only
water
so
i
had
a
relapse
then
a
nice
gent
kicked
in
with
a
flask
and
i
came
to
maybe
you
think
those
artful
kidders
did
hand
it
to
me
anybody
but
a
lady
would
have
lost
her
temper
and
cursed
them
but
i
told
them
where
to
get
off
and
you
forget
it
but
i
used
no
language
that
would
have
led
people
to
think
i
was
anything
but
what
i
should
be
after
that
i
managed
to
skate
around
a
little
but
let
me
tell
you
that
night
i
got
down
on
the
floor
to
take
my
shoes
off
all
right
but
it
took
estelle
that
my
maid
and
a
derrick
to
get
me
up
again
say
it
getting
late
and
i
must
be
going
you
know
mabel
is
now
a
bride
again
and
her
little
husband
has
been
staying
down
at
the
club
instead
of
loitering
about
the
flat
so
the
other
night
when
he
knocked
on
the
door
to
get
in
mabel
said
that
you
charles
and
now
she
ca
get
him
out
of
the
house
nights
you
see
her
husband
name
is
arthur
so
long
sabrina
now
falls
in
love
with
a
press
agent
with
the
hectic
chatter
he
proposes
and
is
accepted
and
sabrina
shows
her
love
and
devotion
by
going
his
bail
when
he
is
arrested
for
permitting
his
jealousy
to
get
the
better
of
him
in
a
restaurant
chapter
eight
who
the
guy
that
said
love
laughs
at
locksmiths
just
show
him
to
muh
i
show
him
where
he
got
in
wrong
it
enough
to
get
a
perfect
lady
goat
my
wilbur
tried
it
the
night
he
got
pinched
and
all
he
got
was
a
clout
on
the
knob
from
the
desk
sergeant
and
a
languishing
number
in
a
prison
and
i
do
dare
to
go
within
a
mile
of
the
drum
the
way
i
caper
from
one
tribulation
to
another
would
make
a
sick
woman
out
of
far
stronger
than
me
yes
i
have
at
last
found
a
man
that
loves
me
for
myself
alone
he
a
press
agent
and
he
hands
it
out
so
sincere
that
i
know
he
must
mean
part
of
it
he
going
to
buy
me
an
engagement
ring
as
soon
as
he
gets
his
expense
account
he
with
a
broadway
musical
comedy
and
though
he
has
run
some
of
the
girls
pictures
he
has
not
made
the
slightest
advance
toward
any
of
them
he
been
coming
to
see
me
for
nearly
a
month
my
heart
went
out
to
him
the
minute
he
said
he
had
a
stand
in
with
three
city
editors
us
actresses
never
get
over
our
theatrical
training
he
a
quiet
party
and
instead
of
hanging
about
the
knickerbocker
bar
with
the
rest
of
the
agents
he
stays
in
the
office
and
pounds
out
copy
he
gave
me
a
beautiful
silk
parasol
that
i
know
did
cost
him
less
than
four
pairs
of
seats
and
all
this
before
he
asked
me
for
my
hand
in
marriage
honest
i
never
forget
the
night
he
proposed
as
long
as
i
live
not
that
i
never
was
proposed
to
before
and
some
of
them
would
have
had
me
starred
but
the
romantic
surroundings
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
it
was
this
way
me
and
him
were
the
guests
at
a
beefsteak
party
and
after
the
fourth
drink
he
commenced
to
show
me
marked
attention
and
when
we
got
out
of
the
cab
in
front
of
my
hotel
he
offered
to
help
me
upstairs
though
i
generally
have
a
bellboy
for
that
purpose
and
when
we
had
got
up
in
my
apartment
and
estelle
had
gone
to
give
the
bellhop
a
quarter
and
the
pitcher
he
popped
the
question
and
such
beautiful
language
i
remembered
it
the
next
morning
and
wrote
it
down
he
held
my
shrinking
little
hand
in
his
and
said
say
kid
you
made
an
awful
good
showing
with
me
believe
it
i
could
plant
your
stuff
all
the
rest
of
my
life
and
while
i
ai
much
of
a
litho
myself
still
i
can
get
away
with
it
and
am
the
man
who
invented
red
on
yellow
i
pay
for
many
electric
signs
for
you
but
still
if
you
plant
your
heart
in
my
i
guarantee
there
wo
be
any
excess
and
making
money
enough
to
most
of
your
extras
listen
party
we
split
my
salary
every
saturday
night
i
got
good
backing
in
the
bank
and
i
want
you
to
be
my
little
star
you
angel
was
that
sweet
that
word
angel
aroused
my
suspicions
for
the
nonce
for
angels
are
the
ones
who
generally
get
lanced
but
he
handed
it
out
so
fervent
that
i
knew
he
would
make
good
on
some
of
the
points
so
from
force
of
habit
i
said
bring
out
your
contract
and
with
those
tender
words
and
the
pitcher
the
bellhop
had
brought
back
we
plighted
our
troth
what
do
you
know
about
that
i
do
believe
i
ever
before
was
as
much
in
love
as
i
am
now
why
i
ai
been
to
see
any
other
show
but
his
for
two
weeks
of
course
i
have
been
engaged
before
and
handed
out
this
gag
before
but
it
was
done
only
to
vary
the
monotony
of
my
former
theatrical
career
and
increase
my
income
what
sure
i
get
an
allowance
from
the
fellows
i
engaged
to
it
only
fair
ai
i
got
a
trooso
to
buy
te
he
if
i
saved
all
the
money
i
have
been
given
to
purchase
troosos
with
i
would
have
a
bunch
that
would
make
gladys
vanderbilt
layout
look
like
a
gingham
wrapper
sure
ai
it
worth
money
to
those
wops
to
have
the
pure
love
of
a
good
true
girl
gee
do
make
me
laugh
like
a
baby
i
was
betrothed
to
six
at
one
time
and
the
diamond
rings
i
wore
made
the
prima
bite
her
with
jealousy
oh
i
had
a
great
graft
i
had
a
birthday
in
every
week
stand
system
well
i
should
hope
so
dear
we
work
it
this
way
alla
mcsweeney
and
i
were
chumming
together
and
naturally
monday
night
after
the
show
we
would
meet
some
folks
we
would
have
a
real
nice
time
and
along
about
fourth
highball
time
after
the
show
wednesday
night
alla
would
whisper
real
confidential
into
one
of
the
fellows
ear
that
i
was
going
to
be
friday
and
we
girls
are
planning
to
give
her
a
little
surprise
and
did
he
want
to
come
in
on
it
every
time
the
johns
would
fall
except
in
milwaukee
and
nobody
ever
got
anything
out
of
that
town
anyway
then
alla
would
whisper
that
the
company
was
going
to
present
me
with
a
loving
cup
because
i
was
such
a
good
fellow
and
if
they
wanted
to
chip
in
now
was
their
chance
and
anything
was
acceptable
from
up
and
to
bring
his
friends
alla
would
tout
it
up
something
fierce
i
being
totally
unconscious
to
what
was
coming
off
friday
night
would
come
around
and
alla
would
borrow
the
loving
cup
from
the
property
man
that
the
tenor
used
in
the
drinking
number
put
it
under
her
shawl
and
caper
over
to
the
appointed
cafe
i
would
be
the
center
of
a
bunch
of
merry
all
wanting
to
blow
out
the
candles
on
my
birthday
cake
after
the
wine
got
to
flowing
freely
and
the
crowd
all
jolly
alla
would
drag
out
the
prop
and
make
a
nice
little
speech
on
behalf
of
the
company
me
you
know
i
would
be
that
flustered
that
i
did
know
what
to
do
and
when
alla
would
say
that
other
people
beside
the
members
of
the
company
had
assisted
i
would
be
so
gratified
that
i
could
scarce
keep
back
the
tears
all
the
clucks
that
had
chipped
in
would
feel
so
bad
because
they
were
included
in
my
outburst
of
gratitude
that
nine
times
out
of
ten
they
would
sneak
out
and
try
to
break
into
a
jewelry
store
then
saturday
alla
and
i
would
do
the
great
divide
take
it
from
me
when
i
came
in
off
the
road
that
season
i
had
a
roll
of
the
evergreen
that
looked
like
a
bundle
of
hall
carpet
but
now
that
i
am
an
heiress
i
do
not
have
to
adopt
those
subterfuges
in
order
to
get
the
daily
java
but
i
could
work
those
stunts
on
my
wilbur
he
too
wise
and
being
in
the
business
he
hep
to
all
that
kind
of
work
he
a
good
nice
honest
fellow
as
press
agents
go
and
i
think
i
can
safely
trust
him
with
my
innocent
heart
if
he
do
well
you
know
me
if
he
do
think
he
run
up
against
the
business
end
of
a
cyclone
it
will
be
because
i
got
throat
trouble
and
ca
talk
honest
my
fair
young
brow
is
commencing
to
get
wrinkled
trying
to
dope
out
whether
i
want
to
become
a
bride
or
lead
the
free
and
easy
life
of
a
bachelor
girl
of
course
if
i
get
married
and
do
like
it
divorces
are
easy
enough
to
get
and
then
being
a
widow
saves
a
girl
a
whole
lot
of
embarrassment
for
she
do
have
to
pretend
to
not
understand
some
of
the
innuendoes
that
are
now
and
then
sprung
during
the
modern
conversations
but
on
the
other
hand
wilbur
is
there
with
a
very
big
fresh
air
fund
and
by
perseverance
i
might
cop
out
a
pittsburg
millionaire
and
become
famous
marriage
is
worse
than
a
lottery
it
a
strong
second
for
the
show
business
you
never
can
tell
wilbur
sure
does
treat
me
nice
he
promised
that
i
shall
be
a
flower
girl
at
the
friar
festival
when
it
comes
off
in
may
ai
that
nice
of
him
gee
but
that
going
to
be
the
grand
doings
are
you
going
to
the
ball
say
the
round
of
festivities
i
am
pulling
off
lately
would
make
a
person
think
i
was
a
society
bud
oh
come
closer
listen
a
certain
party
wants
me
to
go
out
in
vaudeville
what
do
you
know
about
that
can
you
see
me
doing
and
getting
in
a
contest
with
eva
tanguay
or
vesta
victoria
or
the
russell
brothers
i
would
go
in
a
minute
though
i
promised
mother
when
i
quit
burlesque
that
i
would
never
again
wear
tights
when
i
was
in
the
business
if
i
could
get
a
job
on
my
voice
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
flash
a
photo
taken
as
captain
of
the
high
jinks
cadets
and
then
in
a
minute
flo
ziegfield
made
me
all
kinds
of
offers
to
go
in
the
soul
kiss
but
the
blondes
were
all
full
and
you
can
see
me
in
a
brindle
wig
i
am
willing
to
sacrifice
nearly
anything
for
art
but
when
it
comes
to
leaving
nineteen
dollars
worth
of
puffs
in
a
dressing
room
where
you
ca
pick
your
company
not
for
little
sabrina
i
used
to
have
trouble
enough
with
my
number
eighteen
and
lip
stick
and
the
bunch
of
kleptomaniacs
that
the
manager
made
a
great
mistake
taking
on
the
road
in
the
last
show
i
was
with
well
to
get
back
to
vaudeville
i
do
know
whether
to
do
a
single
turn
or
put
on
a
big
act
with
a
dancing
scene
or
a
prizefight
in
it
those
things
go
big
nowadays
i
could
get
the
music
publishers
to
slip
me
a
little
on
the
side
for
using
their
songs
too
of
course
i
do
need
the
money
for
i
got
the
biggest
part
of
that
ten
thou
inheritance
left
yet
but
still
it
would
keep
me
busy
and
away
from
the
cafes
for
now
all
i
do
all
day
long
is
to
roam
around
from
one
place
to
another
imbibing
booze
and
balloon
juice
it
beautiful
billiards
all
right
for
the
time
being
but
i
always
feel
so
on
the
blink
the
next
morning
wilbur
does
care
that
is
he
said
he
knew
i
had
artistic
temperament
and
if
i
wanted
to
get
it
out
of
my
system
vaudeville
was
as
good
as
anything
i
was
talking
to
a
guy
the
other
day
that
is
in
vaudeville
and
he
said
that
down
around
the
james
building
you
could
buy
acts
by
the
pound
another
guy
wanted
to
take
my
money
and
star
me
in
a
musical
comedy
was
he
the
kind
gent
gee
i
did
tell
you
how
wilbur
come
to
get
pinched
did
i
well
it
was
this
way
you
know
wilbur
is
of
spanish
descent
even
though
he
was
born
in
canarsie
and
he
has
a
very
jealous
disposition
so
the
night
after
i
had
promised
to
be
his
own
little
star
of
hope
he
discovered
me
in
a
certain
cafe
with
another
party
this
other
party
was
a
dramatic
critic
and
i
was
touting
wilbur
show
but
wilbur
did
know
that
so
when
he
saw
me
sitting
there
having
the
time
of
my
young
life
he
lost
his
nanny
and
caused
a
scene
forgetting
this
other
party
was
a
critic
in
his
passion
the
head
waiter
threw
them
both
out
and
the
critic
seeing
the
police
coming
said
this
is
an
actor
trying
to
lick
me
and
naturally
the
cops
nearly
beat
poor
wilbur
to
a
pulp
i
went
down
to
the
station
house
and
tried
to
get
wilbur
out
but
the
police
were
so
rude
that
i
had
to
tell
them
where
to
get
off
and
they
threatened
to
jug
me
so
i
slid
wilbur
got
out
the
next
day
though
and
told
me
over
the
that
he
loved
me
all
the
more
for
trying
to
come
to
his
rescue
i
wish
they
would
import
the
emporia
police
force
here
i
can
lick
him
myself
my
is
it
that
late
wilbur
will
be
waiting
to
take
me
over
to
childs
so
long
sabrina
returns
to
the
chorus
so
that
she
can
keep
an
apartment
a
maid
and
an
automobile
without
causing
comment
she
also
talks
of
getting
a
for
the
summer
with
some
girl
friends
and
discourses
on
the
advisability
of
having
the
wardrobe
mistress
for
a
chaperone
chapter
nine
virtue
has
its
own
reward
and
that
all
it
ever
gets
remarked
sabrina
the
show
girl
as
we
met
her
on
the
street
i
am
once
again
a
this
floating
around
town
as
one
of
the
idle
rich
is
all
to
the
peaches
for
a
while
but
as
a
continuous
performance
it
makes
a
poor
showing
you
know
when
i
first
became
an
heiress
i
had
a
put
up
in
my
boudoir
and
a
little
notice
pinned
on
it
that
read
everybody
and
then
i
would
lay
in
bed
all
morning
and
make
faces
at
it
everybody
had
a
large
bunch
of
fun
kidding
me
about
my
inheritance
till
i
was
nearly
bug
why
would
you
believe
it
i
could
go
to
dinner
or
riding
with
a
gentleman
friend
but
some
humorous
dame
sitting
at
another
table
would
arch
her
eyebrows
and
then
if
i
introduced
them
to
the
gent
they
would
say
am
very
glad
to
meet
you
suchandsuch
how
are
things
in
pittsburg
at
last
it
got
so
bad
that
i
decided
to
go
back
to
work
and
earn
my
little
twenty
per
so
that
i
could
keep
my
automobile
and
wear
good
clothes
without
the
slightest
taint
of
suspicion
on
my
character
with
that
noble
end
in
view
i
started
on
the
still
hunt
nothing
doing
with
that
traveling
thing
i
tucked
my
little
scrapbook
under
my
arm
and
sat
in
the
after
hanging
around
in
there
for
about
half
an
hour
i
would
be
permitted
to
glide
into
the
big
boss
i
had
a
nice
little
monologue
framed
up
as
to
my
virtues
no
that
the
wrong
word
ability
none
of
the
managers
asked
me
what
i
had
done
but
what
did
i
get
when
i
called
on
the
gentlemen
by
whom
i
am
now
employed
he
said
oh
piffle
can
you
wear
tights
he
said
that
to
me
i
merely
mentioned
that
i
used
to
work
for
ziegfeld
and
he
hired
me
at
once
i
did
even
have
to
show
him
my
picture
taken
as
aphrodite
in
a
classical
art
study
i
went
over
to
rehearsal
and
of
all
the
frowsy
dames
i
ever
piped
far
be
it
from
me
to
knock
but
they
looked
like
a
bunch
of
that
had
just
rushed
over
from
child
the
stage
manager
was
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
asked
him
when
he
had
started
an
old
ladies
home
and
he
told
me
mind
you
this
is
the
strictest
confidence
that
the
divorce
courts
and
the
cheap
rates
from
pittsburg
was
raising
cain
with
the
crop
of
i
was
standing
over
near
the
piano
when
the
leading
lady
galloped
in
believe
me
the
dog
she
put
on
would
make
you
think
that
she
had
every
other
star
looking
like
a
twinkle
and
before
she
landed
where
she
is
now
she
was
leading
lady
for
a
moving
picture
company
but
the
comedian
honest
when
he
gets
a
couple
under
his
belt
he
is
just
that
funny
gee
i
nearly
howled
my
head
off
at
him
calling
the
tenor
gertrude
say
he
got
awfully
peevish
and
was
mad
enough
to
crush
a
grape
when
he
found
out
that
he
could
have
the
when
he
does
his
duet
number
with
the
ingenue
and
when
he
found
out
that
he
would
have
to
dress
with
the
character
comedian
who
is
a
low
coarse
brute
always
drinking
beer
in
the
dressing
room
and
not
sharing
with
anybody
he
got
so
mad
i
thought
he
would
burst
into
tears
he
another
of
these
exaggerated
ego
guys
every
move
a
picture
wears
his
handkerchief
up
his
sleeve
and
all
that
kind
of
guff
the
funniest
thing
about
the
whole
show
is
that
the
author
is
staging
the
piece
and
what
he
do
know
about
the
show
business
would
make
the
lenox
library
look
like
a
news
stand
he
wanted
the
tenor
to
hold
the
prima
so
she
could
show
her
rings
and
that
the
only
thing
that
got
her
the
job
her
jewelry
we
open
in
hartford
in
a
couple
of
weeks
and
then
play
washington
and
then
come
in
here
for
a
run
honest
the
way
those
two
towns
fall
for
this
soandso
is
to
be
congratulated
upon
securing
for
his
next
week
attraction
suchandsuch
elaborate
production
of
the
great
london
success
rancid
prune
with
the
following
cast
of
metropolitan
favorites
and
some
of
them
ach
himmel
i
do
wish
that
the
merry
springtime
would
hurry
up
and
kick
in
them
can
have
the
winter
that
likes
it
but
not
for
little
give
me
the
summer
and
that
nest
again
number
when
the
bock
beer
signs
again
wave
in
the
breeze
and
the
dutchman
in
the
delicatessen
do
think
you
are
a
bug
when
you
ask
for
summer
sausage
when
the
mint
commences
to
sprout
in
the
cigar
box
on
the
fire
escape
and
all
nature
seems
glad
i
just
love
those
trips
on
the
night
boat
up
the
hudson
with
the
searchlight
shining
on
the
trees
and
the
ice
tinkling
in
the
highball
glass
as
the
steward
comes
down
the
deck
you
know
that
i
am
naturally
even
when
sober
of
a
romantic
and
emotional
temperament
but
those
nights
i
can
sit
and
hold
hands
and
inhale
cocktails
until
daylight
without
an
effort
and
then
sundays
down
at
manhattan
beach
dubbing
around
in
a
bathing
suit
and
take
this
from
me
as
advance
information
the
bathing
suit
i
am
going
to
wear
this
year
is
going
to
chase
the
waves
clear
out
in
the
ocean
i
do
know
yet
whether
i
can
wear
it
at
rockaway
or
not
it
a
cinch
i
ca
if
they
have
another
moral
wave
like
they
did
last
year
it
chic
without
being
bizarre
and
i
can
safely
say
without
fear
of
successful
contradiction
that
i
look
well
in
it
and
if
i
can
keep
my
hair
from
getting
wet
i
be
the
one
best
bet
but
if
the
briny
mingles
with
my
marcel
wave
good
night
nurse
one
of
hepner
assistants
told
me
that
if
salt
water
ever
touched
my
golden
tresses
that
the
only
thing
i
could
do
to
keep
them
from
turning
green
was
to
get
scalped
a
friend
of
mine
who
owns
a
yacht
is
going
to
send
his
wife
and
daughter
on
a
trip
to
europe
and
he
told
me
to
count
myself
one
of
a
party
of
six
that
are
going
to
make
a
tour
of
all
the
neighboring
resorts
no
not
that
kind
summer
resorts
fresh
we
had
the
one
grand
time
last
year
i
never
had
a
more
enjoyable
time
just
press
a
button
and
the
steward
was
right
on
the
job
to
take
your
order
anything
from
a
glass
of
hops
to
a
merry
widow
cocktail
and
you
have
to
dig
once
everything
paid
for
ad
lib
ah
those
happy
evenings
that
appeal
so
to
every
true
lover
of
nature
and
well
mixed
drinks
to
sit
and
listen
to
the
lapping
of
the
waters
and
booze
us
girls
are
talking
about
getting
a
houseboat
this
season
if
we
have
to
work
of
course
the
chances
are
that
it
will
never
come
off
but
up
to
date
that
is
the
last
dressing
room
pipe
we
are
figuring
on
getting
a
nice
place
within
trolley
distance
of
broadway
and
then
get
several
of
our
wine
agent
friends
to
stock
it
for
us
we
wo
need
much
furniture
an
ice
box
and
a
corkscrew
are
the
only
real
necessities
do
you
think
it
would
cast
asparagus
on
my
character
if
i
should
reside
in
a
houseboat
unchaperoned
oh
we
can
get
the
wardrobe
mistress
for
a
chaperone
but
why
talk
shop
and
besides
she
gets
a
bun
on
and
goes
to
sleep
in
a
hamper
and
we
girls
have
to
pack
our
own
bundles
and
if
she
got
soused
while
chaperoning
the
mob
it
would
take
away
the
otherwise
proper
air
of
refinement
and
leave
us
open
to
the
gibes
and
scoffs
of
those
who
were
not
so
fortunate
as
to
be
invited
to
our
houseboat
say
i
do
want
to
indulge
in
brag
or
ostentation
but
the
gown
i
am
going
to
wear
to
the
friar
festival
they
are
going
to
pull
off
in
may
is
going
to
have
some
class
to
it
wilbur
that
my
betrothed
is
going
to
be
one
of
the
main
guys
and
when
it
comes
his
day
to
get
the
showing
keep
your
eye
on
muh
i
think
klaw
and
erlanger
are
just
the
nicest
men
to
give
the
friars
the
new
york
theatre
for
the
big
doings
you
want
to
go
all
our
set
will
be
there
with
their
hair
in
a
braid
oh
yes
wilbur
and
i
are
getting
along
just
splendid
we
have
been
engaged
now
for
nearly
two
weeks
and
have
only
broken
it
off
three
times
i
went
to
see
hook
of
holland
the
other
night
and
wilbur
got
jealous
and
told
me
that
if
his
show
was
good
enough
for
me
to
see
without
having
to
go
to
others
to
just
come
across
with
his
ring
and
he
would
cancel
the
engagement
i
being
a
girl
of
some
spirit
and
pride
just
naturally
yanked
ring
off
and
threw
it
at
him
that
made
him
hedge
and
before
long
we
were
cooing
over
a
bottle
of
wine
like
a
couple
of
turtle
doves
you
ca
take
any
too
much
off
these
men
keep
guessing
thats
my
system
and
then
they
will
walk
sideways
so
as
to
not
overlook
any
bets
take
that
alla
mcsweeney
for
example
she
falls
in
love
and
is
always
on
the
job
like
faithful
fido
sits
around
the
flat
and
gazes
at
his
photo
all
day
and
from
quitting
time
on
she
is
there
with
her
ear
to
the
ground
waiting
to
hear
him
get
out
of
the
elevator
that
aint
little
sabrina
graft
nix
wilbur
calls
up
and
i
tell
him
to
wait
a
minute
and
let
him
cool
his
heels
downstairs
for
a
while
and
then
when
i
do
send
for
him
to
come
up
he
is
more
glad
to
see
me
and
manages
to
amuse
himself
in
hunting
for
a
stray
glove
or
a
handkerchief
and
then
sometimes
when
he
calls
up
i
am
out
just
to
let
him
know
that
he
is
not
the
only
star
performer
that
stunt
keeps
them
at
heel
all
the
time
and
so
busy
trying
to
keep
track
of
you
that
they
do
have
time
to
look
for
any
other
dame
so
that
it
works
both
ways
for
the
dealer
and
a
couple
of
tears
will
always
copper
any
wrong
play
you
make
this
beatrice
fairfax
dope
may
be
all
right
in
the
simple
country
maiden
but
it
do
go
in
the
show
business
worth
a
whoop
you
got
to
be
on
your
toes
in
this
game
and
play
no
steady
system
my
how
i
run
on
here
i
will
be
late
for
rehearsal
and
will
have
to
give
the
stage
manager
an
excuse
and
he
will
fall
for
it
until
some
time
i
have
got
good
reason
for
being
late
and
then
he
will
call
me
say
is
it
considered
au
fait
for
a
to
do
a
little
plugging
for
wedding
presents
this
early
in
the
game
well
so
long
sabrina
in
this
chapter
attends
a
beefsteak
party
and
becomes
involved
in
an
argument
with
a
certain
party
who
was
formerly
her
roommate
but
whom
she
left
quietly
and
by
night
chapter
ten
do
i
look
like
a
tea
store
chromo
inquired
sabrina
as
estelle
her
maid
opened
the
door
oh
such
a
time
i
had
never
again
will
i
go
to
see
that
alla
mcsweeney
pipe
my
dial
get
onto
the
scratch
there
are
some
wounds
that
even
powder
can
not
hide
it
all
started
this
way
the
girls
down
at
wilbur
show
decided
to
give
a
beefsteak
in
honor
of
the
prima
donna
getting
the
can
believe
me
if
they
had
let
a
hanging
piece
fall
on
her
she
would
have
got
but
half
what
was
coming
to
her
cat
well
i
should
say
so
dear
she
spoiled
the
whole
effect
of
that
rather
be
a
lemon
than
a
quince
number
just
because
she
would
let
the
pony
girls
share
the
spot
in
the
picture
honest
she
caused
more
troubles
than
louis
nethersole
english
actors
ever
imagined
they
had
i
met
her
socially
several
times
and
she
certainly
was
perfectly
lovely
to
me
but
when
she
got
back
on
the
stage
why
she
even
had
the
stagehands
stepping
sideways
and
you
know
them
and
the
manager
could
call
his
soul
his
own
until
he
had
loaded
her
into
a
cab
and
on
her
way
wilbur
told
me
that
while
on
the
road
that
between
watching
the
panners
in
the
box
offices
and
keeping
her
from
throwing
a
fit
on
the
stage
he
got
as
for
her
maid
i
can
only
say
that
poor
creature
one
time
the
maid
pinched
her
foot
while
buttoning
her
shoe
and
what
does
the
prima
donna
do
but
bounce
her
whole
makeup
box
on
the
top
of
the
maid
defenseless
nob
and
the
way
she
looks
on
the
street
compared
to
what
she
does
on
the
stage
that
makeup
box
must
certainly
have
been
of
some
size
of
course
i
am
not
roasting
the
poor
creature
for
it
may
be
temperament
instead
of
temper
but
i
am
merely
stating
what
i
have
heard
but
to
get
back
to
the
big
eat
the
prima
donna
got
too
gay
and
when
they
struck
new
york
the
home
office
got
wise
and
she
would
stand
a
cut
in
her
salary
so
they
just
naturally
decorated
her
with
the
festive
bug
and
told
her
to
take
a
whirl
at
vaudeville
or
something
else
real
mean
say
when
the
news
got
out
that
she
was
to
leave
everybody
was
so
happy
that
even
the
chorus
men
went
out
and
bought
each
other
a
beer
what
do
you
think
of
that
well
anyway
the
mob
got
together
after
the
performance
and
decided
to
celebrate
the
event
in
fitting
and
proper
style
by
getting
soused
and
alla
kindly
donated
her
new
flat
yes
the
judge
caught
a
sleeper
on
wall
street
and
she
was
in
strong
with
the
cop
on
the
beat
and
the
people
on
the
floor
below
her
had
moved
on
account
of
the
noise
selfish
people
they
did
want
to
do
anything
all
night
but
sleep
and
alla
complained
that
they
were
wearing
out
the
steam
pipe
by
pounding
on
it
after
the
show
the
whole
outfit
cleaned
all
the
makeup
off
except
behind
the
ears
and
took
it
on
the
lope
for
alla
domicile
me
being
the
guest
of
honor
i
naturally
kicked
in
late
gee
everybody
of
any
importance
was
there
even
some
of
the
principals
and
every
other
show
in
town
sent
at
least
one
representative
say
the
drum
was
so
crowded
that
some
of
the
couples
had
to
turn
the
fire
escape
into
a
conservatory
they
would
crawl
out
there
and
bombard
the
neighborhood
with
empty
bottles
until
the
cop
on
the
corner
would
rap
and
then
for
some
two
or
three
minutes
the
block
would
be
as
silent
as
a
tomb
wilbur
of
course
was
there
in
his
official
capacity
as
press
agent
to
not
only
add
tone
to
the
gathering
but
to
make
sure
that
it
reached
the
night
desk
of
all
the
papers
for
if
these
society
guys
get
a
column
and
a
half
they
ought
to
be
willing
to
slip
us
poor
chorus
dolls
a
couple
of
sticks
and
keep
it
from
under
police
news
i
was
there
to
see
that
wilbur
did
not
under
the
influence
of
the
charming
company
make
any
remarks
that
might
be
misconstrued
by
any
of
the
assembled
gathering
as
a
declaration
of
love
for
them
dolls
are
always
on
the
job
and
the
only
time
they
do
catch
a
live
one
is
when
their
hands
are
tied
jealous
what
me
not
so
you
can
notice
it
but
i
ai
going
to
have
anybody
have
anything
on
me
and
while
i
caused
no
scenes
i
left
the
impression
that
i
had
wilbur
trained
so
that
he
would
roll
over
and
play
dead
at
the
word
of
command
while
these
off
the
grass
signs
do
do
much
good
still
they
run
a
horrible
bluff
did
wilbur
get
wise
to
this
move
on
my
part
not
on
your
life
if
he
found
out
that
i
was
figuratively
speaking
riding
herd
on
him
he
would
get
chesty
and
all
swelled
up
until
it
would
be
my
painful
duty
to
lance
him
i
do
know
yet
whether
wilbur
is
a
rhinestone
billie
or
a
whisky
amber
billie
with
a
dash
of
bitters
billie
but
i
am
on
the
job
betty
all
right
all
right
well
to
get
back
to
the
beefsteak
after
all
the
guests
had
assembled
which
was
maybe
some
they
started
in
it
was
merely
the
ordinary
stunt
of
beer
and
beefsteak
and
beefsteak
and
beer
but
the
hours
were
enlivened
by
the
vaudeville
performances
of
the
guests
this
was
before
the
precinct
sergeant
knocked
on
the
door
one
old
frump
that
must
have
been
tramming
a
mace
in
the
roman
hanging
gardens
got
a
yen
that
was
doing
imitations
she
had
elsie
janis
and
gertrude
hoffman
looking
like
a
couple
of
false
starts
another
took
the
hooks
out
of
her
marsel
wave
and
did
that
stunt
of
then
one
of
the
chorus
men
gave
an
imitation
of
george
cohan
as
usual
but
that
do
explain
the
scratches
does
it
to
go
back
sometime
there
was
a
certain
skirt
that
i
used
to
room
with
in
chicago
when
we
were
both
broke
but
one
night
she
went
out
with
a
bunch
of
boys
and
came
home
with
a
large
and
juicy
snoot
full
and
spent
the
early
morning
hours
in
leaning
out
of
the
window
of
the
apartment
and
whistling
through
her
fingers
to
the
milkmen
as
well
as
staging
a
disrobing
number
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
the
curtains
up
to
such
an
extent
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
outlying
districts
had
to
wait
sometime
for
their
morning
milk
this
naturally
grated
on
my
refined
sensibilities
so
the
next
morning
while
she
was
yet
beating
the
hay
i
packed
my
little
suitcase
and
took
it
on
the
run
away
from
there
leaving
her
you
might
say
on
the
pan
i
went
into
the
pony
ballet
of
a
la
salle
theatre
show
can
you
see
me
as
a
pony
and
i
heard
that
she
was
advancing
art
with
a
stock
burlesque
in
south
chicago
that
evening
she
was
among
those
present
at
the
aforementioned
social
function
and
while
we
kissed
and
embraced
each
other
with
the
affection
of
long
lost
sisters
still
i
could
detect
above
the
odor
of
cocktails
an
underlying
current
of
soreness
so
we
clinched
but
i
took
particular
pains
to
see
that
we
went
clean
in
the
breakaway
a
young
gentleman
from
pittsburg
was
one
of
the
guests
and
this
creature
naturally
put
herself
forward
to
make
him
have
a
real
nice
time
and
while
i
am
true
to
wilbur
still
i
think
it
my
duty
to
be
kind
to
every
one
this
chicago
party
got
the
hunch
that
i
was
trying
to
beat
her
to
this
pittsburg
wop
and
she
managed
to
get
him
in
a
corner
and
i
could
see
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
that
she
was
making
a
strenuous
effort
to
reveal
some
of
my
past
and
while
i
have
never
done
anything
that
would
cast
a
breath
of
suspicion
on
my
spotless
character
still
i
knew
that
this
party
would
not
hesitate
for
a
minute
to
do
some
romancing
so
i
naturally
edged
over
toward
that
particular
corner
as
if
i
was
not
noticing
myself
do
it
and
overheard
her
inform
the
gent
that
while
i
had
the
outward
appearance
of
an
innocent
young
babe
i
was
a
viper
at
heart
and
had
beat
it
out
of
chicago
with
some
ten
or
twelve
thousand
dollars
worth
of
her
personal
jewelry
shucks
all
the
jewelry
she
ever
had
was
a
diamond
stickpin
she
bit
out
of
a
gentleman
scarf
when
they
were
going
home
in
a
cab
and
all
she
had
left
of
that
was
the
pawn
ticket
naturally
hearing
the
libelous
remarks
i
was
compelled
to
defend
myself
so
i
quietly
interrupted
her
conversation
by
remarking
lightly
over
her
shoulder
i
see
laura
that
you
are
still
a
member
of
the
arm
and
hammer
band
and
i
wish
to
mention
in
passing
that
the
only
ten
or
twelve
thousand
dollars
worth
of
jewelry
you
ever
had
you
returned
to
the
property
man
every
night
after
the
ballroom
scene
as
for
me
eloping
with
your
belongings
all
you
ever
had
was
a
dirty
handkerchief
kimona
a
fluffy
ruffles
skirt
and
a
jacket
and
you
had
to
throw
a
chill
when
you
entered
a
cafe
so
as
not
to
have
to
take
that
off
if
you
had
you
would
have
been
disgraced
for
life
after
those
kind
remarks
laura
goat
naturally
make
a
quick
exit
she
jumped
to
her
feet
and
with
one
of
those
on
her
bridal
expressions
said
you
is
it
sabrina
you
were
always
noted
as
the
kid
but
now
if
you
have
got
all
of
that
humorous
monologue
of
yours
out
of
your
system
you
can
toddle
right
along
and
sell
your
matches
as
this
kind
gentleman
and
i
are
discussing
a
few
words
in
private
and
do
not
wish
them
to
get
all
over
town
that
chatter
said
i
do
forget
the
happy
days
you
spent
at
sid
euson
right
there
is
where
i
got
that
scratch
but
i
being
pretty
nifty
with
my
fins
gave
her
a
cuff
on
the
chops
that
she
have
to
put
down
in
her
diary
to
remember
i
was
just
fishing
for
an
opening
to
land
when
wilbur
stayed
my
upraised
arm
and
i
could
only
give
her
a
kick
on
the
limb
with
my
french
heel
naturally
the
noise
and
the
words
attracted
some
attention
even
from
that
bunch
that
is
it
could
be
heard
above
the
usual
hum
of
conversation
the
dame
knowing
that
i
was
in
the
right
tried
to
tuck
the
pittsburg
party
under
her
arm
and
duck
the
dump
but
pittsburg
being
a
game
guy
stuck
for
the
big
show
and
laura
loped
for
the
alone
wilbur
was
naturally
surprised
and
grieved
at
my
actions
and
for
a
moment
allowed
the
monster
to
take
up
standing
room
in
his
heart
thinking
that
i
had
succumbed
to
the
wealth
of
the
coal
dealer
but
my
ready
outburst
of
maidenly
tears
quickly
set
me
to
rights
that
was
the
only
thing
that
marred
the
evening
except
one
of
the
girls
spoke
kindly
to
a
chorus
man
and
he
poor
fellow
threw
a
fainting
fit
and
we
had
to
force
the
only
jig
juice
in
the
crowd
between
his
clinched
teeth
before
he
could
be
revived
yes
i
am
still
on
the
stage
but
i
have
got
the
stage
manager
trained
so
that
i
only
have
to
slip
him
a
five
spot
any
night
i
fail
to
appear
no
there
is
much
doing
except
that
some
of
the
girls
are
rehearsing
for
the
soul
kiss
contest
but
i
personally
do
not
have
to
advertise
what
going
say
on
your
way
down
tell
the
barhop
to
mix
me
up
a
life
preserver
in
a
rose
glass
sabrina
touches
on
the
advantages
of
having
a
hotel
for
chorus
girls
and
makes
several
comments
on
the
dramatic
possibilities
of
the
mangled
doughnut
with
which
she
is
rehearsing
chapter
eleven
say
remarked
sabrina
as
we
met
her
in
front
of
her
favorite
cafe
say
loosen
up
cough
give
down
come
to
kick
in
you
got
to
donate
for
a
couple
of
tickets
to
the
annual
benefit
of
the
unemployed
or
otherwise
disabled
chorus
girls
home
and
the
quicker
you
come
across
the
quicker
your
suffering
will
be
over
sure
we
are
going
to
have
a
benefit
that
will
make
even
the
friar
festival
get
up
and
hump
itself
and
you
know
that
going
to
be
some
show
the
chorus
mutual
knocking
society
is
going
to
build
a
home
so
that
the
poor
doll
who
comes
in
from
the
high
grass
in
her
normal
condition
broke
can
have
some
place
to
go
and
rest
and
refresh
herself
without
having
to
hock
a
couple
of
wedding
rings
before
she
can
have
her
hotel
trunk
sent
up
there
going
to
be
fifty
sleeping
rooms
and
maids
so
that
if
the
poor
skirt
wakes
up
in
the
morning
feeling
far
from
a
well
woman
all
she
has
to
do
is
to
tickle
the
and
the
maid
is
right
there
on
the
job
there
is
to
be
nineteen
parlors
with
two
pianos
in
each
parlor
while
there
will
be
a
chaperon
of
course
she
will
permit
the
young
ladies
to
entertain
their
friends
in
a
quiet
and
ladylike
manner
until
the
porter
starts
cleaning
up
the
bar
in
the
morning
the
inmates
will
of
course
be
allowed
to
sign
checks
but
from
visitors
only
cash
will
be
accepted
can
you
see
a
mob
of
those
merry
dames
around
that
drum
talk
about
your
something
doing
every
minute
say
it
will
look
like
open
time
around
that
shack
burlesquers
are
canceled
they
ca
come
into
the
home
well
they
never
have
much
of
a
home
anyway
so
they
do
miss
much
burlesque
is
sure
one
strenuous
existence
mother
made
me
quit
that
and
the
doctor
telling
me
that
i
would
ruin
myself
standing
around
a
draughty
stage
in
tights
and
besides
those
burlesque
stage
hands
certainly
are
cruel
why
you
have
to
put
the
money
right
in
their
hand
before
they
will
beat
it
across
the
alley
for
a
can
of
suds
if
that
ai
cruelty
i
do
know
what
is
do
they
think
us
girls
would
enjoy
our
refreshment
if
we
have
to
pay
for
it
ourselves
why
it
has
got
the
same
flavor
do
you
think
a
girl
lacks
class
when
she
puts
salt
in
her
beer
that
home
will
be
a
great
thing
imagine
going
home
every
night
without
wondering
if
your
room
is
locked
and
the
landlady
sitting
on
your
trunks
at
the
top
landing
you
can
just
flounce
into
your
nest
any
old
time
and
know
that
everything
is
right
there
unless
one
crafty
girl
has
bribed
the
chambermaid
for
the
key
you
can
never
tell
about
those
people
why
i
know
one
girl
who
kept
stealing
hairs
out
of
the
different
wigs
in
the
until
she
had
enough
to
make
a
dutch
braid
and
then
she
put
on
such
a
front
and
chest
that
she
would
speak
to
any
of
the
other
girls
should
she
happen
to
meet
them
socially
i
have
always
wanted
a
home
not
that
i
have
been
offered
several
but
i
mean
a
permanent
one
but
to
continue
about
the
benefit
wilbur
is
going
to
manage
it
and
he
expects
to
shake
down
enough
to
start
us
housekeeping
but
of
course
that
is
strictly
under
your
hat
and
i
pray
you
do
not
mention
it
i
think
we
can
get
erlanger
to
let
us
use
the
new
york
theatre
if
we
promise
not
to
damage
the
fixtures
he
lets
every
other
benefit
have
it
and
he
certainly
would
object
to
a
few
poor
chorus
girls
pulling
off
a
shindy
seeing
as
how
they
did
so
much
for
his
success
suppose
none
of
us
had
gone
on
in
the
chorus
of
just
think
what
would
have
happened
did
know
there
was
a
chorus
in
say
what
are
you
trying
to
do
kid
me
or
just
show
me
a
good
time
i
was
around
yesterday
trying
to
get
some
of
the
oldtime
who
are
now
some
of
our
leading
actresses
to
appear
at
the
benefit
but
they
all
threw
a
fit
at
the
mere
mention
of
the
fact
that
they
had
once
carried
a
spear
for
my
part
i
see
nothing
degrading
in
the
work
even
if
we
are
held
up
to
the
gibes
and
chaff
of
some
of
these
newspaper
it
certainly
is
an
honorable
calling
and
if
you
look
good
from
the
front
you
can
always
have
your
pick
of
the
menu
so
that
any
dame
that
can
hand
out
the
frightened
fawn
glance
need
never
starve
ai
it
funny
the
way
these
johns
stick
their
noses
to
the
ground
and
start
on
the
trail
of
soldiers
villagers
they
pass
up
anything
just
to
be
able
to
stick
their
arm
through
the
stage
door
and
hand
the
doorkeeper
a
bunch
of
violets
they
will
leave
flossie
the
belle
of
the
village
waiting
at
the
gate
any
time
a
burlesque
shows
up
on
the
side
of
the
blacksmith
shop
and
right
down
front
with
their
feet
on
the
base
drum
handing
out
the
coy
glances
before
the
first
curtain
is
a
foot
from
the
stage
yep
i
still
rehearsing
with
mangled
doughnut
and
the
author
of
the
book
told
me
yesterday
in
the
strictest
confidence
that
it
will
be
the
best
performance
hartford
ever
saw
he
says
he
expects
to
stay
up
all
that
night
rewriting
the
book
but
he
is
willing
to
sacrifice
a
few
hours
sleep
in
the
interest
of
art
and
for
the
musical
numbers
as
we
are
rehearsing
songs
some
of
them
ought
to
go
the
only
thing
wrong
with
the
show
as
far
as
i
can
see
is
that
the
prima
donna
acts
like
she
was
in
a
trance
it
is
my
personal
opinion
of
course
i
would
have
you
breathe
this
to
a
living
soul
for
worlds
but
it
is
my
personal
opinion
that
she
sniffs
the
white
she
either
does
that
or
jabs
though
it
do
show
on
her
arm
the
leading
comedian
is
a
sad
affair
he
would
make
a
good
understudy
for
a
morgue
and
that
about
all
why
i
offered
him
suggestions
for
some
new
business
in
his
cafe
scene
and
he
went
on
the
run
and
informed
me
that
when
he
desired
instructions
from
the
chorus
concerning
the
way
to
handle
his
part
he
would
address
me
in
writing
i
said
to
him
be
it
from
me
to
get
gay
old
top
but
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
you
get
busy
with
the
pen
and
ink
then
he
was
going
to
have
me
fired
such
a
chance
he
had
better
find
out
what
i
know
about
the
past
history
of
the
person
who
hired
me
before
he
hands
out
any
lurid
language
about
my
dismissal
i
know
right
where
i
stand
and
though
i
am
one
of
the
shop
girls
in
the
first
act
instead
of
having
my
regular
place
as
an
american
heiress
i
know
right
where
i
stand
every
shake
out
of
the
box
viola
clare
is
sure
having
the
one
strenuous
time
with
her
new
husband
the
poor
dear
is
nearly
balmy
in
the
crumpet
from
worry
you
see
they
have
been
married
but
four
long
weeks
and
the
last
three
nights
he
has
been
coming
home
sober
and
she
believes
he
is
deceiving
her
so
she
is
trying
to
get
enough
money
from
him
so
that
she
can
hire
a
private
detective
to
have
him
shadowed
they
tell
me
that
sam
harris
has
to
punch
a
time
clock
i
know
one
thing
and
that
is
when
i
am
married
wilbur
will
not
be
one
of
the
leading
lights
of
the
knickerbocker
even
if
i
have
to
prance
down
there
and
drag
him
out
by
the
neck
gee
there
ai
much
doing
in
town
now
wilbur
and
a
couple
of
friends
are
already
running
trial
heats
for
the
club
dinner
and
if
he
ever
recovers
from
that
our
engagement
will
be
announced
i
am
having
the
photographs
taken
now
tell
me
do
you
think
it
good
form
for
a
lady
to
have
her
wedding
announcement
accompanied
by
pictures
of
herself
in
tights
wilbur
says
that
it
wo
help
me
but
it
will
do
the
show
a
lot
of
good
and
he
says
somebody
connected
with
my
show
should
be
done
good
besides
the
manager
i
will
say
one
good
word
about
our
show
it
has
a
grand
first
act
the
other
two
acts
may
be
on
the
cheese
but
the
first
act
is
good
the
author
says
the
first
act
of
a
show
is
the
only
one
that
needs
any
attention
because
it
is
the
only
one
the
critics
ever
stick
for
anyway
we
got
great
scenery
the
second
act
is
made
of
what
you
might
call
a
composite
set
being
composed
out
of
all
the
scenery
from
the
other
failures
this
year
did
i
say
other
failures
i
spoke
inadvertently
this
elaborate
production
with
its
cast
of
metropolitan
favorites
and
its
famous
beauty
chorus
as
wilbur
says
may
be
all
right
mind
you
i
only
say
may
the
first
act
is
laid
in
a
quince
plantation
and
the
quinces
of
the
chorus
are
discovered
at
curtain
rise
picking
the
luscious
fruit
there
is
a
naval
vessel
in
the
harbor
this
was
put
in
so
the
tenor
could
wear
his
white
duck
uniform
he
had
to
wear
something
and
when
the
management
found
that
he
had
a
white
duck
uniform
every
tenor
has
you
know
or
he
would
be
a
tenor
when
the
management
found
that
he
had
a
uniform
they
took
the
money
they
had
advanced
for
costumes
away
from
him
and
rewrote
the
first
act
as
i
say
we
lemons
are
picking
quinces
or
we
quinces
are
picking
lemons
any
way
you
want
to
take
it
and
after
finishing
the
opening
chorus
we
rush
up
stage
open
center
and
in
comes
the
prima
donna
in
a
pony
cart
a
stone
boat
would
suit
her
better
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
see
pony
cart
chance
for
number
by
pony
ballet
with
six
trained
doughnuts
you
see
that
where
the
title
of
the
play
is
introduced
that
the
only
time
the
title
shows
up
except
a
duet
between
the
leading
lady
and
the
tenor
entitled
had
rather
be
a
doughnut
in
harlem
than
a
butter
cake
in
childs
the
prima
and
the
tenor
do
an
imitation
of
the
widow
waltz
the
author
did
want
that
put
in
but
the
backer
of
the
show
convinced
him
that
nowadays
every
true
musical
comedy
had
an
imitation
of
the
widow
waltz
so
he
let
it
slide
after
that
in
comes
the
comedian
as
the
valet
of
a
wealthy
american
just
arrived
on
the
battleship
he
has
got
a
great
entrance
it
brought
out
by
some
plot
lines
spoken
by
two
of
the
chorus
girls
that
he
has
taken
a
taxaballoon
from
the
boat
and
while
up
in
the
air
he
bites
the
rope
of
the
balloon
in
two
in
a
fit
and
falls
center
stage
with
a
red
spotlight
on
him
that
the
musical
cue
for
his
song
rather
be
up
in
the
air
than
up
in
the
bronx
he
has
learned
extra
verses
and
says
that
he
will
give
them
all
if
the
ushers
hands
hold
out
when
he
is
through
in
comes
the
soubrette
formerly
a
lady
boilermaker
in
canarsie
but
now
disguised
as
an
adventuress
in
search
of
the
missing
papers
she
has
the
papers
in
a
locket
given
her
by
her
mother
but
do
know
it
until
the
comedian
bites
her
on
the
neck
in
the
third
act
and
breaks
the
chain
when
the
locket
falls
to
the
ground
and
the
papers
fall
out
the
second
act
is
a
scene
in
maxim
where
the
leading
lady
is
washing
dishes
that
gives
more
comedy
with
the
comedian
as
a
dish
the
american
is
hiding
from
his
wife
and
goes
to
maxim
because
he
knows
she
be
there
if
she
was
shucks
there
would
be
no
show
he
does
his
specialty
with
a
piece
of
cheese
not
the
prima
donna
and
after
that
the
american
beauty
chorus
comes
in
and
does
a
refined
my
how
i
have
run
on
i
just
know
i
be
late
for
rehearsal
but
forget
the
benefit
we
need
the
money
wilbur
and
me
so
long
in
which
sabrina
prepares
to
leave
town
with
the
show
but
pauses
to
pass
a
few
remarks
on
love
comedians
murders
maids
spring
millinery
and
the
advisability
of
anyone
marrying
their
first
husband
chapter
twelve
goodbye
dear
said
sabrina
as
we
met
her
hurrying
up
broadway
our
show
leaves
town
we
got
to
get
to
hartford
in
time
for
a
dress
rehearsal
before
the
evening
performance
my
such
a
time
we
have
had
you
know
the
comedian
we
had
threw
up
the
sponge
at
the
last
minute
and
we
had
to
dig
up
another
thank
goodness
this
one
is
a
gentleman
and
not
getting
fresh
with
the
every
time
he
gets
a
chance
oh
say
was
you
at
the
friars
sunday
night
in
bohemia
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
the
friars
spend
every
night
in
bohemia
or
the
knickerbocker
bar
so
wilbur
says
but
honest
this
was
a
great
stunt
seconded
only
by
the
festival
they
are
going
to
pull
off
in
may
the
curtain
went
up
on
what
looked
like
a
busy
day
in
childs
and
wells
hawks
was
in
the
spotlight
surrounded
by
a
bevy
of
blondes
and
empty
champagne
bottles
they
tell
me
that
gus
edwards
had
to
blindfold
hawks
to
lead
him
up
to
the
table
where
the
empty
bottles
were
and
as
for
the
girls
it
was
with
a
great
effort
that
they
restrained
themselves
all
they
could
do
was
to
look
at
the
empty
bottles
hold
their
noses
and
drink
mineral
water
ai
it
awful
mabel
anyway
everybody
had
a
good
time
so
what
care
they
for
gibes
and
jeers
many
the
time
have
i
held
a
champagne
cork
to
my
nose
closed
my
eyes
and
dreamed
that
i
was
having
a
time
well
to
continue
about
our
show
wilbur
says
it
will
never
go
because
they
only
got
block
stands
and
an
agent
ai
got
no
show
without
at
least
one
kind
of
a
litho
wilbur
said
it
hurt
the
artistic
instinct
of
a
billposter
in
these
hick
towns
to
put
up
all
block
stands
and
you
generally
have
to
slip
them
a
little
something
to
be
sure
that
they
burn
up
all
the
extra
stuff
so
that
the
manager
of
the
company
would
find
it
should
he
go
snooping
around
the
bill
room
when
the
show
gets
in
town
he
says
if
they
get
a
good
litho
of
a
killing
or
a
chorus
they
will
go
out
of
the
way
to
stick
them
up
just
for
art
sake
wilbur
is
going
to
give
me
a
suit
case
full
of
hard
tickets
to
the
friar
festival
and
told
me
to
mace
every
john
i
came
across
on
the
road
for
as
many
as
he
would
stand
for
he
said
the
more
i
sent
in
the
more
he
would
know
i
loved
him
wilbur
is
so
romantic
this
new
comedian
we
got
with
the
show
is
pretty
good
but
of
course
i
can
see
defects
and
the
new
prima
donna
is
real
nice
she
asked
me
into
her
the
other
afternoon
and
slipped
me
a
little
idea
encourager
that
she
had
in
a
flask
but
the
way
she
is
in
love
with
the
tenor
honest
it
sickening
to
me
she
watches
him
from
the
time
he
comes
in
the
theatre
until
the
time
he
leaves
and
then
calls
him
up
on
the
at
his
home
the
other
day
when
he
asked
one
of
the
girls
to
tie
the
ribbon
in
his
cuff
she
got
so
jealous
that
i
thought
she
was
going
to
give
the
poor
kid
a
lam
on
the
lamp
what
she
can
see
in
that
tenor
is
beyond
me
what
anybody
can
see
in
a
tenor
has
got
me
guessing
for
that
matter
wilbur
says
that
just
the
way
with
temperamental
people
and
he
lost
a
job
once
just
because
he
forgot
to
land
pictures
in
the
sunday
editions
of
all
the
newspapers
in
town
of
the
manager
own
particular
guiding
star
but
planted
a
bunch
of
her
dearest
friend
instead
he
says
there
no
pleasing
them
and
the
only
way
to
have
peace
and
harmony
around
the
whole
show
shop
is
to
print
flashlights
of
the
entire
company
and
even
that
looks
like
blazes
for
the
editor
will
always
reduce
an
flashlight
to
a
cut
no
matter
how
many
drinks
you
buy
him
he
says
he
saw
a
murder
once
was
the
only
witness
in
fact
and
he
took
it
on
the
run
to
a
newspaper
office
and
offered
to
trade
a
charles
sommerville
to
the
editor
for
a
reading
notice
about
the
show
and
the
editor
told
him
that
they
could
get
all
they
wanted
from
the
police
and
what
they
did
get
would
hurt
the
public
if
they
did
know
about
it
he
says
if
that
would
give
the
press
agent
art
a
kick
in
the
neck
nothing
would
wilbur
says
he
loves
his
art
and
nothing
pleases
him
better
than
to
find
a
box
office
that
will
take
his
i
o
u
us
chorus
have
been
sure
working
hard
the
past
week
and
ben
teal
has
been
just
that
kind
and
gentle
and
did
put
a
one
of
us
on
the
pan
we
certainly
have
got
some
lovely
costumes
they
ai
much
to
them
but
what
there
is
is
beautiful
they
smell
a
little
of
camphor
but
they
have
been
packed
away
in
hampers
ever
since
last
season
and
that
accounts
for
it
i
got
a
fine
scene
with
the
comedian
and
should
score
a
great
personal
triumph
all
of
us
girls
are
lined
up
for
his
entrance
in
the
second
act
and
when
he
comes
in
he
walks
right
over
to
me
and
says
little
one
how
are
you
on
the
queen
wedding
day
wedding
day
that
my
cue
and
i
say
well
thank
you
kindly
noble
sire
aint
that
great
it
takes
nearly
a
whole
side
i
was
rehearsing
it
in
my
apartment
this
morning
with
estelle
but
she
was
so
rotten
as
the
comedian
that
i
took
away
the
last
i
gave
her
for
a
tip
these
menials
have
no
talent
in
their
souls
estelle
that
my
maid
says
she
has
no
desire
to
elevate
the
drama
and
she
had
rather
be
a
maid
for
a
chorus
girl
any
time
there
more
money
in
it
she
may
be
right
at
that
alla
mcsweeney
is
going
to
start
a
new
thought
church
she
says
that
she
has
a
whole
flock
of
new
thoughts
and
it
would
be
quite
fashionable
to
start
this
new
think
stunt
she
said
she
would
tell
us
her
new
thoughts
if
she
thought
we
would
never
breathe
a
word
to
a
living
breathing
soul
gee
that
lets
our
gang
out
they
could
keep
quiet
if
it
killed
them
honest
for
a
bunch
of
knockers
perfect
both
in
single
handed
knocking
and
team
work
our
set
has
anything
bound
to
the
bannister
in
new
york
but
what
care
i
spring
is
coming
and
we
will
all
soon
hike
to
bath
beach
honest
for
a
country
place
with
all
the
conveniences
of
home
bath
beach
is
the
top
liner
you
can
put
a
can
under
your
shawl
and
rush
a
couple
of
blocks
and
always
get
it
full
of
the
best
and
if
you
put
butter
around
the
side
of
the
pail
the
barkeep
ignores
the
fact
and
goes
right
ahead
i
may
get
a
motor
boat
this
summer
if
wilbur
gets
his
summer
snap
at
the
island
coney
i
mean
not
blackwell
he
has
never
been
over
there
except
to
take
flowers
to
the
poillon
sisters
they
love
nature
so
charlotte
says
it
makes
her
homesick
every
time
she
sees
a
joy
line
boat
go
by
the
benefit
season
will
soon
open
and
any
person
that
has
a
couple
of
thousand
dollars
to
pay
for
a
theater
can
git
a
benefit
for
himself
and
maybe
draw
down
a
couple
of
hundred
more
the
benefit
for
the
chorus
girls
has
gone
up
in
the
air
for
none
of
them
would
acknowledge
that
they
were
chorus
girls
they
were
either
show
girls
or
pony
dancers
and
that
let
them
out
anyway
each
girl
wanted
to
bring
her
maid
and
the
dressing
rooms
would
have
been
so
full
of
maids
that
there
would
have
been
no
room
for
the
dolls
i
had
it
all
framed
up
too
i
had
six
wine
agents
and
a
whisky
salesman
who
guaranteed
to
appear
and
that
alone
would
have
made
the
thing
a
financial
success
but
what
could
i
do
our
bunch
has
been
rehearsing
five
weeks
without
salaries
and
with
the
excessive
taxicab
rates
we
got
no
money
to
spend
on
clothes
to
wear
to
the
ball
and
the
wardrobe
mistress
keeps
an
awful
tab
on
the
costume
hampers
a
certain
friend
of
mine
who
by
the
way
i
would
trust
any
further
than
i
can
throw
an
elephant
by
the
tail
had
the
nerve
to
take
me
up
in
her
apartment
the
other
day
and
show
me
her
new
bathing
suit
she
had
just
imported
from
paris
it
was
a
swell
thing
all
right
but
sewed
in
the
waistband
was
a
piece
of
cloth
that
said
on
it
so
you
can
draw
your
own
conclusions
honest
the
way
some
girls
steal
is
something
awful
take
it
from
me
it
nothing
less
than
stealing
to
swipe
a
wardrobe
of
course
if
the
show
is
going
to
close
it
all
right
but
from
a
successful
production
never
lifting
a
scarfpin
from
a
soused
party
is
all
right
for
he
is
supposed
to
do
something
to
remunerate
the
lady
for
wasting
her
time
by
taking
her
to
supper
spring
has
sure
come
and
i
do
just
glory
in
nature
i
suppose
that
is
because
i
was
brought
up
in
the
country
we
never
have
anything
but
nature
in
emporia
oh
i
heard
from
the
folks
the
other
day
and
they
tell
me
that
emporia
is
now
growing
to
be
some
town
the
bank
is
putting
up
a
brick
building
which
is
going
to
be
looked
on
as
the
village
skyscraper
the
town
council
has
already
passed
resolutions
restricting
the
height
of
the
buildings
to
six
stories
they
ai
going
to
take
the
chance
that
new
york
does
and
have
some
of
these
big
tall
affairs
topple
over
into
their
streets
all
the
yaps
out
in
that
neighborhood
are
lining
out
for
the
spring
plowing
now
while
the
yaps
here
are
lining
out
for
the
spring
millinery
openings
i
already
got
the
dressmaker
on
the
job
for
seven
or
eight
modest
little
frocks
that
will
make
them
sit
up
and
take
notice
sundays
down
at
manhattan
beach
i
have
decided
that
i
am
going
to
be
an
athletic
girl
this
summer
and
am
already
taking
exercise
every
day
why
i
walk
all
the
way
from
the
subway
to
the
hotel
and
that
nearly
half
a
block
say
what
do
you
know
about
this
posey
golden
has
married
her
first
husband
honest
you
know
they
were
divorced
shortly
after
she
got
a
good
job
and
have
been
living
apart
ever
since
she
married
again
to
the
nicest
gambler
you
ever
met
but
he
got
stung
on
a
sleeper
and
had
to
hock
the
family
jewels
and
posey
said
that
was
cruelty
for
she
could
never
have
the
face
to
go
down
to
the
dining
room
for
breakfast
without
all
of
her
diamonds
on
she
had
worn
them
every
day
since
they
struck
the
reckless
and
she
was
afraid
it
might
cause
talk
among
the
waiters
and
guests
because
she
always
treated
them
with
a
calm
air
of
condescension
and
they
would
lay
for
the
chance
to
get
in
a
hammer
so
she
put
in
a
bid
for
a
divorce
and
got
it
then
she
met
her
first
better
half
on
the
street
and
after
having
a
little
supper
they
decided
to
sneak
through
the
tunnel
take
it
on
the
run
for
newark
and
again
become
one
imagine
anybody
going
to
newark
to
get
married
imagine
any
one
going
to
newark
for
anything
they
got
married
and
came
back
to
town
just
as
happy
as
if
nothing
had
ever
happened
my
i
hope
wilbur
and
i
will
be
that
way
i
think
he
is
sincere
even
if
he
does
write
good
notices
about
girls
in
his
show
well
i
must
toddle
along
and
see
if
wilbur
has
cashed
his
yet
so
that
i
can
get
the
rest
of
that
new
hat
if
it
ai
too
much
trouble
you
can
send
me
a
bunch
of
flowers
for
our
opening
night
in
hartford
so
long
the
show
gives
its
opening
performance
and
sabrina
scores
a
great
personal
success
she
speaks
at
some
length
of
the
kissing
craze
and
makes
several
comments
on
the
time
she
had
while
out
of
town
chapter
thirteen
are
you
coming
to
the
opening
tonight
began
sabrina
the
show
girl
before
she
had
given
her
order
i
do
know
if
you
can
get
a
seat
or
not
because
the
management
is
tired
of
having
the
same
old
gang
out
in
front
and
have
donated
about
of
the
house
to
the
ladies
at
the
martha
washington
for
they
know
more
about
a
real
show
than
anybody
because
they
read
the
dramatic
page
of
all
the
fashion
magazines
and
the
other
third
of
the
house
will
be
taken
up
by
the
dramatic
critics
and
their
friends
we
had
a
great
opening
in
hartford
the
theatre
was
crowded
four
rows
back
the
first
act
went
great
but
we
could
tell
how
the
last
one
went
because
nobody
but
the
author
and
composer
stayed
for
it
and
they
are
a
little
partial
i
scored
a
great
personal
triumph
and
the
way
i
read
my
lines
was
not
only
greeted
with
applause
but
with
laughter
in
fact
i
made
such
a
decided
hit
that
the
prima
donna
who
by
the
way
is
worse
than
the
first
because
she
drinks
had
the
manager
take
my
lines
away
from
me
and
give
them
to
somebody
who
could
not
read
them
as
well
if
i
afraid
she
would
blackball
me
for
the
i
would
raise
a
kick
the
idea
of
an
old
frump
like
that
letting
professional
jealousy
interfere
with
art
after
the
performance
that
night
the
author
got
busy
and
rewrote
the
whole
second
act
and
had
it
all
ready
by
the
time
we
landed
in
washington
do
you
think
we
get
a
chance
to
rush
around
and
mingle
with
the
congressmen
and
other
such
truck
not
on
your
life
it
was
to
the
show
shop
for
us
and
do
the
big
rehearsal
all
day
and
we
only
had
time
to
slip
out
and
soak
up
a
sandwich
and
get
back
in
time
for
the
performance
i
changed
my
tights
from
blue
to
pink
for
the
first
night
and
scored
another
personal
triumph
so
much
so
that
the
soubrette
made
it
a
point
to
stand
in
front
of
me
every
time
she
did
a
number
with
the
chorus
she
belonged
over
on
the
other
side
in
front
of
the
glonesganes
creature
in
order
to
dress
the
stage
and
the
manager
jumped
all
over
her
for
moving
the
show
went
big
that
night
and
the
next
day
some
of
the
critics
spoke
favorably
of
it
i
do
care
what
they
say
it
a
good
show
and
as
the
plot
has
been
almost
entirely
eliminated
it
should
go
well
here
after
rehearsing
all
day
tuesday
we
were
allowed
to
walk
up
and
down
pennsylvania
avenue
and
get
acquainted
i
met
a
gentleman
who
said
he
had
been
introduced
to
me
in
new
york
and
he
certainly
treated
me
grand
we
went
over
to
the
willard
for
supper
and
he
just
tossed
the
menu
toward
me
careless
like
and
said
to
it
kid
talk
about
your
southern
gallantry
a
bunch
of
these
will
rush
a
girl
into
a
feedshop
and
they
have
no
more
than
got
seated
at
the
table
before
he
will
commence
talking
about
the
big
dinner
he
has
just
had
so
that
the
poor
thing
feels
like
a
burglar
if
she
eats
anything
more
than
a
couple
of
lobsters
but
not
this
percival
he
frankly
admitted
that
he
had
had
anything
to
eat
for
a
week
and
scratched
no
entries
i
wish
these
new
yorkers
were
that
way
nothing
personal
dear
but
they
have
become
so
callous
to
feeding
the
that
they
have
the
big
eat
dodging
stunt
down
to
a
science
the
only
way
to
get
more
than
a
including
wine
feed
out
of
most
of
these
pocketbooks
is
by
blasting
why
i
have
known
certain
parties
to
adopt
the
subterfuge
of
going
out
to
telephone
and
then
beating
it
to
avoid
paying
the
check
thus
leaving
the
poor
feedee
to
pay
the
bill
or
wait
longingly
for
a
friend
to
show
up
on
the
horizon
a
gentleman
who
will
pull
off
a
deal
like
that
is
not
worthy
of
the
confidence
of
one
of
our
sex
but
understand
i
am
not
by
any
means
damning
the
whole
male
sex
for
i
have
met
gentlemen
who
threw
the
lid
of
their
grouch
bag
in
the
gutter
and
did
care
if
they
ever
found
it
again
those
is
the
kind
of
parties
that
has
my
trust
me
grub
and
i
got
money
in
the
bank
sure
i
do
i
got
to
keep
in
training
somehow
so
if
i
did
lose
my
inheritance
i
would
be
out
of
practice
wilbur
do
blame
me
for
it
he
says
that
the
object
in
life
of
an
agent
and
a
chorus
girl
is
to
plant
everything
they
can
get
their
fins
into
whenever
they
can
for
it
do
last
long
and
the
good
people
ai
healthy
and
goodness
knows
i
sure
do
need
my
health
for
though
i
appear
to
be
a
strong
robust
creature
i
am
a
frail
woman
wilbur
can
moan
and
groan
around
with
a
hangover
for
a
couple
of
days
but
i
have
to
be
right
on
the
job
all
the
time
with
this
smiling
face
and
laughing
eye
thing
or
he
would
seek
some
other
place
for
sympathy
why
many
a
morning
i
have
spoke
light
and
happy
words
of
cheer
to
him
over
the
with
a
tongue
as
thick
as
a
and
the
inside
of
my
nob
yearning
to
burst
loose
and
flop
around
in
the
cool
morning
air
do
i
caper
up
to
the
transmitter
and
sob
darling
i
fear
me
that
i
am
not
long
for
this
earth
never
i
take
a
long
drink
of
ice
water
and
when
his
this
you
kid
comes
over
the
wire
i
chirrup
back
real
bright
and
gay
o
kiddo
and
when
he
says
he
do
believe
he
can
live
through
the
day
do
i
suggest
that
we
die
together
not
i
i
tell
him
to
forget
it
and
go
downstairs
and
have
george
mix
him
up
a
mug
full
of
the
hair
of
the
dog
that
bit
him
that
shows
the
love
of
a
good
woman
was
you
at
the
chorus
girls
ball
last
saturday
night
my
i
would
hate
to
cast
any
reflections
on
the
judges
but
their
choice
certainly
was
bum
still
i
suppose
they
are
old
men
and
not
up
on
the
modern
rules
on
osculation
in
their
day
when
a
young
man
imprinted
a
chaste
salute
on
a
alabaster
forehead
he
was
supposed
to
go
into
a
fit
of
delight
but
not
according
to
this
year
book
now
they
clinch
with
a
strangle
hold
and
stick
till
one
or
the
other
drops
from
exhaustion
i
did
not
enter
the
contest
for
i
am
not
a
chorus
girl
i
am
a
show
girl
if
you
please
what
the
difference
five
a
week
this
kissing
craze
is
getting
to
be
something
scandalous
not
that
i
object
to
it
but
i
blush
to
think
that
the
customs
that
were
once
performed
in
the
front
parlor
with
the
gas
turned
low
is
now
used
in
contests
and
numbered
as
a
feat
of
strength
wilbur
and
i
went
to
the
ball
together
and
as
soon
as
he
struck
the
hut
he
wanted
to
rush
right
over
and
run
a
few
trial
heats
with
the
contestants
but
the
easy
way
with
which
i
made
him
change
his
mind
was
a
joy
to
the
eye
he
said
to
me
as
we
went
in
the
door
i
think
i
will
toddle
over
to
the
paddock
and
see
if
the
fillies
are
in
form
he
was
making
a
wild
rush
to
check
his
shawl
when
i
mentioned
casual
like
as
if
i
was
noticing
myself
saying
it
know
that
i
am
an
added
starter
bing
skyrockets
wilbur
goes
up
in
the
air
and
comes
down
all
spraddled
out
he
pipes
as
soon
as
he
got
his
breath
financed
bride
billed
to
appear
in
a
hugging
handicap
not
yet
sabrina
you
certainly
do
jag
my
jib
to
think
that
you
would
enter
into
such
a
deal
from
now
on
our
trail
parts
i
do
know
i
said
sauce
for
the
goose
is
sauce
for
the
gander
and
if
you
pull
off
any
stunts
you
can
figure
that
i
will
be
in
the
running
and
that
goes
as
it
lays
that
was
no
nice
language
for
a
lady
but
it
put
the
brakes
on
osculatory
aspirations
so
quick
that
he
stopped
with
a
jolt
he
canceled
the
date
and
we
went
up
into
the
box
and
stood
in
the
receiving
line
for
wine
agents
wilbur
knew
that
he
had
to
stand
hitched
or
i
would
let
him
go
to
the
club
dinner
tonight
he
has
been
training
for
the
event
for
the
last
two
weeks
and
he
says
that
he
will
be
able
to
outdistance
the
bunch
before
and
you
know
that
going
some
it
a
pity
they
would
let
us
women
in
on
their
feed
deals
they
go
out
and
fill
up
on
beefsteak
while
we
have
to
stick
around
and
drown
our
sorrows
in
a
cheese
sandwich
and
goodness
knows
that
while
they
are
nourishing
they
do
give
you
any
new
ideas
i
only
hope
our
show
is
a
success
for
if
wilbur
and
i
get
married
every
penny
will
help
and
i
do
want
to
lance
my
personal
fresh
air
fund
for
anything
more
than
a
bridal
veil
wilbur
and
i
are
just
like
two
doves
but
i
am
taking
no
chances
for
press
agents
are
fickle
people
with
all
due
regard
to
wilbur
feelings
i
must
say
that
the
agent
of
our
company
is
a
dog
he
had
the
nerve
to
come
up
to
us
girls
and
want
us
to
beat
it
up
and
down
broadway
with
signs
boosting
the
show
on
our
backs
a
doll
would
stand
a
swell
chance
in
jack
with
a
big
sign
reading
see
abused
cruller
at
the
folly
on
her
vertebrae
now
would
she
can
you
see
me
as
the
walking
i
make
exhibition
enough
of
myself
on
the
stage
without
prancing
up
and
down
with
one
of
those
things
tied
to
my
fluffy
ruffles
i
just
had
an
awful
time
in
washington
one
of
the
girls
that
dresses
in
the
same
room
with
me
came
in
with
one
of
those
crying
buns
on
and
shed
so
many
weeps
in
my
makeup
box
that
i
had
to
put
it
on
with
an
atomizer
i
did
all
a
human
being
could
do
to
bring
her
to
rubbed
her
hands
and
slapped
her
face
but
even
then
she
was
in
no
fit
condition
to
appear
go
on
she
would
in
spite
of
my
prayers
and
what
does
she
do
when
she
comes
tripping
on
blithe
and
gay
as
a
school
girl
but
stumble
and
do
a
slide
on
her
profile
half
way
across
the
side
just
as
the
tenor
was
starting
the
chorus
to
his
song
in
little
children
he
being
a
nervous
party
springs
a
blue
note
that
got
the
musical
director
hysterical
and
he
forgot
to
give
the
bass
drum
man
his
cue
and
the
whole
thing
went
to
blazes
it
was
lucky
that
the
stage
manager
was
making
a
date
on
the
dressing
room
stairs
or
what
she
would
have
got
would
have
been
you
know
laura
who
was
married
a
few
weeks
ago
well
she
is
again
a
widow
her
husband
got
a
job
with
a
road
show
she
was
thinking
of
wearing
mourning
but
her
husband
staked
her
to
the
price
of
a
new
spring
suit
and
she
said
that
conventionalities
could
go
hang
as
she
had
a
shape
and
was
going
to
show
it
i
do
blame
her
why
let
grief
put
it
on
style
gee
it
wo
be
long
before
summer
and
then
we
will
get
our
salaries
reduced
that
the
trouble
with
the
people
i
work
for
every
time
they
get
a
success
here
in
town
they
start
to
reduce
salaries
if
the
company
would
stand
for
it
we
would
be
owing
them
money
every
week
before
the
end
of
the
season
they
think
a
girl
has
nothing
to
do
but
ride
around
in
an
automobile
and
look
sweet
well
me
to
get
on
the
war
paint
say
have
you
offered
your
services
for
the
friar
festival
yet
well
you
had
better
get
on
the
job
if
you
want
to
consider
yourself
classy
so
long
oh
you
know
the
ushers
will
hand
flowers
over
the
footlights
if
you
just
tell
him
who
they
are
for
the
show
opens
on
broadway
and
sabrina
shows
surprise
at
the
number
of
harsh
words
in
the
english
language
she
discloses
the
methods
of
the
lease
breakers
association
and
mentions
the
events
that
transpired
at
a
little
informal
gathering
chapter
fourteen
my
did
you
see
what
the
critics
said
about
our
show
exclaimed
sabrina
show
girl
as
her
maid
opened
the
door
was
it
awful
i
did
know
there
were
so
many
mean
words
in
the
book
and
the
nerve
of
them
to
pan
me
after
meeting
several
of
them
socially
one
of
them
said
that
i
looked
so
good
standing
up
that
it
was
a
crime
to
have
me
sit
down
but
when
i
spoke
for
goodness
sake
get
the
muffler
the
mut
i
should
go
down
and
horsewhip
him
but
no
that
what
us
people
that
figure
in
public
are
bound
to
get
they
never
say
a
good
word
until
after
the
minister
says
thou
art
to
dust
returneth
and
then
some
cluck
is
liable
to
come
along
and
dig
up
a
bunch
of
letters
i
am
thinking
seriously
of
taking
a
flat
until
summer
i
do
like
this
hotel
one
has
to
keep
so
many
conventionalities
why
the
other
day
my
was
out
of
order
and
i
ran
down
to
the
desk
in
my
kimona
to
telephone
and
the
clerk
had
the
nerve
to
call
me
for
it
can
you
surpass
that
i
told
him
to
open
his
ears
and
let
his
head
cool
off
i
was
looking
at
a
nice
flat
the
other
day
but
they
want
me
to
sign
a
lease
what
do
i
know
about
a
lease
there
ai
no
half
salary
clause
in
it
if
i
did
sign
the
lease
and
want
to
beat
it
all
i
would
do
would
be
to
call
in
the
lease
breakers
association
and
i
could
leave
the
next
day
that
mob
responds
to
a
call
like
the
crowd
in
the
cadillac
when
some
one
says
i
buy
and
you
can
take
it
from
me
that
going
some
sure
have
you
heard
of
the
lease
breakers
association
they
guarantee
to
break
any
lease
in
less
than
a
week
it
is
composed
of
a
mob
of
select
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
can
make
the
most
noise
a
person
wishing
to
leave
their
abode
and
handicapped
with
a
lease
has
but
to
blow
the
whistle
for
this
gang
and
furnish
plenty
of
refreshments
and
there
is
nothing
to
it
i
attended
one
the
other
evening
and
we
all
had
the
one
grand
time
a
friend
of
mine
has
ceased
being
married
and
naturally
has
no
more
use
for
a
whole
flat
so
she
approached
the
cruel
landlord
and
asked
for
a
release
did
she
get
it
not
he
told
her
that
she
would
have
to
stick
or
stand
the
consequences
does
she
tear
out
a
bunch
of
hair
and
rave
all
over
the
room
not
her
she
gets
the
members
of
the
lease
breakers
on
the
and
that
night
they
hold
the
big
celebration
and
the
next
morning
four
tenants
kicked
to
the
landlord
the
morning
after
that
the
whole
building
kicked
in
a
body
and
the
janitor
had
to
repair
two
ceilings
then
the
guv
asked
her
to
move
and
she
refused
until
he
gave
up
her
month
rent
she
was
foolish
like
one
of
those
birds
they
call
a
fox
i
guess
yes
these
landlords
have
to
go
some
if
they
want
to
get
ahead
of
the
simple
bohemians
what
they
want
rent
for
beats
me
they
own
the
houses
and
that
ought
to
satisfy
them
if
i
do
get
this
flat
take
it
from
me
we
will
pull
off
the
grand
one
time
i
intend
to
hold
a
reception
every
evening
after
the
show
until
i
get
a
request
to
move
say
here
the
big
jest
in
our
set

the
finishing
touches
to
the
big
eats
soul
mate
was
telling
the
story
of
his
life

the
dame
that
soul
mate
had
formerly
been
in
love
with
they
are
both
wise
people
and
neither
tip
their
mit
though
soul
mate
grew
restless
with
his
feet
this
was
about
and
the
mere
shank
of
the
evening
as
it
were
when
all
of
a
sudden
bing
bing
on
the
door
and
in
waltzed
olga

and
soaked
up
a
souse
and

kick

and
tells
him
to

a
drink

oil
on
the
troubled
waters
looked
like

after

drink
or
two
he
beat
it
telling
wifey
to
hurry

then
olga
lands
on
soul
mate
is
this
peroxide
party
an
old
passing
fancy
chirrups
soul
mate
olga
tears
her
hair
and
bites
out
a
bunch
of
hectic
language
about
having
the
only
man
she
ever
loved
being
false
and
how
life
is
naught
but
a
hollow
bubble
and
all
that
kind
of
rot
wilbur
having
sporting
blood
was
for
kidding
them
on
and
seeing
if
they
would
mix
it
but
me
desiring
peace
and
quiet
told
what
i
did
know
about
the
affair
and
squared
things
business
of
embracing
did
you
pipe
the
sassy
mcmanus
got
out
for
the
friar
festival
ai
they
just
too
pretty
for
words
do
you
know
who
that
guy
reading
the
friar
song
down
in
the
corner
is
do
breathe
a
word
and
i
tell
you
it
phil
mindel
honest
it
is
george
sketched
it
from
life
one
night
over
at
the
booze
arts
us
chorus
girls
were
talking
of
marching
to
albany
in
a
body
with
drums
beating
and
flags
flying
and
demanding
that
the
bill
be
ditched
it
is
something
fierce
the
way
these
reformers
are
trying
to
put
the
bee
on
our
pleasures
i
just
dote
on
horse
races
why
i
can
go
to
the
track
and
sit
in
the
cafe
for
hours
i
wonder
what
these
guys
think
we
are
going
to
do
with
our
spare
time
this
summer
sit
at
home
and
make
sofa
pillows
why
there
is
no
greater
sport
in
the
world
than
riding
out
to
sheepshead
or
jamaica
in
an
auto
and
then
borrowing
money
from
your
escort
to
bet
on
the
it
a
great
system
if
you
lose
the
john
gets
nothing
and
if
you
win
you
take
everything
so
it
is
fair
for
all
parties
if
they
want
to
do
something
truly
noble
they
should
put
those
moving
picture
shows
out
of
business
pretty
soon
when
they
want
the
chorus
to
show
up
they
will
let
down
a
sheet
throw
on
the
picture
and
turn
loose
your
highness
welcome
on
the
phonograph
i
ai
mentioning
any
names
but
there
is
a
bunch
of
these
parties
that
belong
on
a
moving
picture
what
do
you
know
about
the
circus
ai
it
all
to
the
pickles
me
there
the
other
matinee
in
a
real
box
courtesy
of
the
management
did
you
get
your
attention
called
to
the
two
janes
that
did
the
ride
in
the
hurdics
down
the
hill
some
class
to
that
act
imagine
looping
the
loop
in
the
air
not
for
sabrina
the
pride
of
the
chorus
as
long
as
i
can
make
my
living
on
my
shape
you
do
catch
me
trying
to
damage
it
soaring
around
in
the
atmosphere
not
for
five
dollars
more
a
week
as
bad
as
i
need
the
money
i
went
to
see
wells
hawks
and
the
elephants
both
of
them
are
permanent
fixtures
though
they
do
say
that
he
is
kept
busy
looking
after
the
animals
at
both
the
hip
and
the
circus
and
the
clowns
may
i
be
struck
dead
if
i
did
just
rear
back
and
howl
my
head
off
at
those
crazy
clucks
alla
mcsweeney
certainly
is
a
sneeze
she
has
no
idea
of
the
fitness
of
things
i
was
telling
her
just
the
other
day
i
said
you
certainly
are
no
piker
you
go
out
and
mace
a
good
fellow
for
a
big
feed
just
as
if
he
was
a
john
now
that
ai
right
when
you
are
out
with
a
james
go
to
it
and
eat
your
head
off
but
when
you
are
out
with
some
one
in
the
business
or
a
newspaper
man
be
circumscribe
though
you
may
want
to
wade
through
the
whole
dope
sheet
hitch
your
desire
and
order
what
you
think
he
can
afford
and
lay
back
until
you
get
a
live
one
what
sure
we
do
if
a
jane
goes
out
with
a
john
that
has
nothing
but
nothing
too
good
for
her
and
walking
is
hard
on
the
feet
the
more
money
the
wop
spends
the
bigger
sport
he
thinks
he
is
but
a
fellow
professional
has
honorable
intentions
sometimes
and
it
is
considered
wise
not
to
show
what
you
are
accustomed
to
until
after
he
has
bought
the
ring
or
written
some
letters
i
may
go
out
with
some
fellow
and
order
everything
from
soup
to
nuts
just
to
show
him
that
i
can
but
the
way
i
won
wilbur
heart
was
by
ordering
a
cheese
sandwich
the
first
time
he
invited
me
out
my
goodness
how
i
run
on
and
here
it
is
getting
late
well
i
must
toddle
along
and
see
how
the
friar
festival
is
i
have
a
personal
interest
in
that
so
long
say
the
next
time
you
expect
to
get
lanced
for
the
big
feed
tell
her
you
were
once
in
the
business
and
it
will
save
you
money
ta
ta
in
which
sabrina
has
a
row
with
the
leaves
the
show
frivols
in
the
vineyard
denounces
the
male
sex
as
being
all
alike
threatens
to
take
the
veil
but
finally
falls
upon
the
neck
of
her
betrothed
and
all
is
forgotten
chapter
fifteen
we
came
upon
sabrina
seated
alone
at
a
table
in
the
rear
of
a
cafe
her
hat
was
tilted
rakishly
over
one
ear
a
couple
of
strands
of
hair
were
hanging
down
over
her
forehead
a
bright
spot
glowed
on
each
cheek
and
her
eyes
had
a
dim
moist
appearance
the
table
was
covered
with
glasses
and
bottles
and
the
chairs
looked
as
if
they
had
been
hastily
shoved
back
as
we
approached
her
she
waved
her
hand
joyfully
and
exclaimed
bri
springtime

our
country

with
incidences
that

bring
gray
hairs
to
the
head
of
much
stronger
women
than
i
it
came
off
last
night
i
was
out
to
supper
with
a
couple
of
gentlemen
wilbur
and
gent
we
were
so
busy
talking
things
over
that
i
did
get
to
the
theater
until
the
middle
of
the
first
act
my
i
never
saw
a
man
so
peevish
as
that
stage
manager
i
had
no
more
than
exchanged
the
courtesies
of
the
day
with
the
stage
doorkeeper
and
asked
after
his
sick
child
than
that
sneeze
that
calls
himself
a
stage
manager
had
the
nerve
to
rush
up
an
fine
me
five
dollars
you
think
of
that
i
told
him
that
i
positively
refused
to
appear

rest
of
the
evening
then
he
told
me
that
i
was
fired

about
that
i
said
calm
and
dignified

perfec
lady

with
your
old
show
i
do

me
and
with
those
kind
words
i
caper
up
to
the
dressing
room
and
take
that
expensive
gown
i
wear
in
the
third
act
and
stuck
it
in
the
wash
bowl
and
turned
on
the
water

needed
cleaning
anyway
then
i
put
a
few
things
that
oughta
belong
to
me
in
my
makeup
box
and
beat
it
i
had
to
kiss
everybody
in
the
company
goo
bye
and
that
made
the
stage
wait
and
the
manager
came
chasing
around
without
any
goat
and
tol
me
never
to
darken
his
door
again
that
all
ri
with
muh

blooming
door

the
gentleman
are
and

the
news

sore
for
since
i
commenced
wearing
those
pink
tights

able
to
lay

to
copper
his
remarks
but
not
for
a
minute

fog
i
just
gather
up
my
skirt
and
sweep

into
taxicab
and
proceed
to

whoop
for
the
best
man
that

quiet
party
that

home
in
the
dark
over
in
jack
and
i
at
once
began
to
mingle
they
were
all
good
fellows
so
i
nearly
gave
them
heart
trouble
by
ordering
wine
for
the
crowd
i
will
not
endeavor
to
chronicle
the
amount
of
lush
i
tucked
away
i
will
only
state
that
if
i
had
not
been
a
good
friend
to
the
bell
hops
i
never
would
have
gotten
upstairs
estelle
that
muh
maid

sitting
up
with
her
face
to
the
pane
waiting
for
me
to
come
home
and
just
to
show
her
how
grateful
i
was
i
gave
her
all
of
wilbur
pictures
and
all
the
change
i
had
in
my
stocking
waiter
you

forgetting
your
duties
in
part
i
finally
got
to
bed
and
then
i
pulled
off
the
big
cry
booze
you
understand
and
not
because
i
lost
that
shooting
wah
of
a
wilbur

should
say
not
do
think
that
i
wear
pink
tights
and
ca
get
the
best
man
that
ever
breathed
i
am
not
a
bit
like
that
glonesganes

throws
herself
at
the
head
of
every
man
she
meets
honest

same
story

would
do
with
myself
if
i
did
have
to
beat
it
to
the
shop
at
least
once
a
day
i
tried
it
once
when
i
first
got
my
fortune
but
life
became
so
monotonous
and
i
got
so
fat
that
i
had
to
start
rehearsing
in
order
to
get
back
to
my
former
self
say
i
think
the
last
dipperful
made
me
feel
better

against
the
middle
in
a
manner
that
would
make
your
hair
curl
i
do
care
i
do
care
wilbur
can
run
and
make
faces
at
himself

gives
an
automobile
party
to
several
of
her
friends
so
that
they
may
enjoy
the
country
air
but
after
investigating
the
atmosphere
carefully
the
opinion
of
the
entire
party
is
that
the
only
healthful
ozone
is
that
that
comes
out
of
a
champagne
bottle
chapter
sixteen
where
you
all
going
demanded
a
voice
and
looking
around
we
discovered
sabrina
the
show
girl
and
two
of
her
girl
friends
seated
in
a
big
red
automobile
that
was
drawn
up
to
the
curb
come
on
jump
in
she
continued
we
are
out
to
commune
with
nature
for
a
few
minutes
and
you
might
just
as
well
be
a
commuter
as
the
rest
of
us
ai
this
the
one
grand
weather
no
you
sit
back
here
we
will
make
wilbur

up

can
see
he
do
grub
the
eats
he
inside
lancing
the
management
for
a
group
of
free
lunch
and
a
package
of
liquid
refreshments
here
he
comes
now
bless
his
young
heart
he
got
his
arms
full
ai
it
grand
to
be
loved
by
such
a
man
no
wilbur
you
get
up
in
the
hurricane
deck
and
we
all
will
sit
in
the
caboose
have
we
got
everything
alla
did
you
forget
the
bag
full
of
cracked
ice
for
the
champagne
now
let
see
where
shall
we
go
first
to
get
the
most
nature
we
can
stop
at
the
cadillac
the
circle
the
casino
in
the
park
and
then
make
a
quick
jump
to
claremont
in
that
way
we
can
get
some
of
the
delightful
spring
air
and
not
be
far
from
a
head
waiter
at
any
time
thats
right
sadie
you
big
gump
put
your
feet
on
the
crackers
those
were
bought
to
eat
and
not
to
be
used
as
a
door
mat
still
if
you
must
wipe
your
feet
we
can
print
on
one
of
the
crackers
and
you
can
clean
your
dorothy
dodds
till
you
are
black
in
the
face
is
everything
ready
do
i
look
all
right
wilbur
give
the
motorman
two
bells
look
out
there
there
goes
er
lawshe
with
a
plaster
cast
of
genee
under
his
arm
do
you
want
to
make
him
drop
it
and
break
his
heart
sadie
it
is
not
necessary
to
give
the
furtive
glance
to
every
gentleman
who
admires
the
machine
go
ahead
and
see
if
you
ca
scrape
the
paint
off
the
cop
alla
my
dear
you
know
it
is
necessary
to
start
eating
now
you
get
yours
and
besides
several
of
the
places
we
will
stop
at
have
free
lunches
so
you
can
have
all
that
you
are
accustomed
to
without
making
inroads
on
the
provision
supply
at
this
stage
of
the
game
what
we
got
in
the
larder
fifteen
bottles
and
cents
worth
of
crackers
my
it
seems
to
me
you
are
squandering
an
awful
lot
of
money
on
food
of
course
if
we
get
shipwrecked
or
something
they
may
come
in
handy
but
at
present
writing
they
are
excess
baggage
whoa
chauffeur
do
you
see
that
bock
beer
sign
whenever
you
see
one
of
those
turn
the
corner
and
stop
at
the
family
entrance
hitch
the
machine
and
we
will
all
soon
see
what
mine
host
has
in
the
way
of
nourishment
sadie
it
is
not
necessary
to
show
such
unseeming
haste
as
it
is
now
but
early
noon
and
the
place
does
not
close
until
after
midnight
this
is
a
dump
but
any
port
in
a
storm
as
the
poets
say
as
i
am
directing
this
cook
tour
we
will
have
but
one
drink
here
wilbur
how
do
you
know
that
the
name
is
george
have
you
been
false
to
me
and
been
here
with
another
bartenders
are
called
george
just
like
chinamen
are
called
john
what
are
you
trying
to
bale
out
to
me
do
you
think
i
am
a
boob
now
alla
go
to
it
and
quench
your
thirst
for
it
may
be
several
blocks
before
we
stop
again
my
ai
this
warm
weather
glorious
it
makes
one
so
thirsty
come
people
let
get
back
in
the
herdic
for
we
have
a
long
journey
ahead
of
us
there
you
go
again
sadie
stepping
all
over
the
crackers
before
we
get
through
we
will
have
to
take
them
in
capsules
look
out
for
that
car
gee
those
cars
are
bad
enough
without
being
mashed
up
more
by
some
sneeze
wagon
certainly
we
go
through
the
fifth
avenue
entrance
to
the
park
i
may
be
some
things
but
i
am
no
piker
and
besides
we
got
as
much
license
as
anybody
i
remember
when
i
used
to
go
horseback
riding
through
here
every
morning
and
i
always
had
my
groom
in
a
beautiful
red
livery
following
me
i
had
the
most
beautiful
black
horse
and
an
elegant
riding
habit
why
there
was
a
day
but
what
i
was
invited
out
to
lunch
sadie
that
was
very
uncalled
for
i
am
in
no
trance
you
of
course
not
being
accustomed
to
those
things
naturally
look
upon
those
people
who
were
brought
up
on
such
stuff
as
balloon
juice
merchants
maybe
that
will
make
you
stand
hitched
look
at
that
hearse
go
by
us
driver
if
you
are
any
good
you
will
make
that
outfit
look
as
if
they
were
bound
to
the
bannister
that
right
give
them
a
touch
of
high
life
if
we
are
going
less
than
a
mile
a
minute
i
hope
i
have
to
walk
home
cheese
there
a
bike
cop
can
you
loose
him
beat
it
bobby
look
out
another
one
in
front
slow
up
for
goodness
sake
or
we
will
be
pinched
what
is
it
sergeant
oh
no
sir
not
more
than
six
miles
an
hour
i
am
sure
this
machine
has
got
a
dudedad
on
it
that
prevents
it
from
going
more
than
ten
wo
you
have
a
little
drink
officer
just
smile
on
the
gent
in
the
front
seat
he
right
there
with
the
distillery
wilbur
chase
the
roof
off
a
jug
of
suds
for
the
lieutenant
i
tell
you
captain
on
my
honor
as
a
lady
we
are
not
going
more
that
six
miles
an
hour
must
take
us
to
the
station
why
you
excuse
for
a
sparrow
cop
would
you
have
the
crust
to
stand
up
in
front
of
a
judge
and
tell
him
that
we
were
going
faster
than
ten
miles
an
hour
if
you
want
to
get
us
to
the
station
it
a
cinch
you
will
have
to
push
the
machine
walk
not
so
you
could
notice
it
the
only
way
you
can
get
me
there
is
to
drag
me
by
the
hair
of
my
head
and
if
you
dare
lay
your
mitts
on
my
new
marcel
wave
i
will
report
you
to
your
commissioner
and
if
a
certain
friend
of
mine
do
stand
strong
enough
with
him
to
have
you
broke
i
eat
my
ostrich
plume
will
let
us
go
if
we
promise
not
to
do
it
again
why
certainly
we
wo
sergeant
thank
you
lieutenant
here
a
little
something
for
the
relief
fund
captain
wilbur
give
the
driver
two
bells
the
nerve
of
that
guy
thinking
he
could
pinch
me
i
have
you
know
that
i
am
only
nicked
by
the
best
cops
on
broadway
and
not
by
any
constable
hand

blows
them
all
to
pieces
in
my

that
fight
talk
even
if
this
is
a
pleasure
party
my
how
time
does
fly
we
are
nearly
home
now
let
all
go
down
the
street
and
see
doing
must
you
leave
us
do
rush
away
in
the
heat
of
the
forenoon
so
long
my
i
am
glad
that
man
out
of
the
machine
sabrina
in
spite
of
the
law
goes
to
the
race
track
and
returns
with
money
she
also
drops
a
few
remarks
concerning
gentlemen
who
claim
their
have
been
purloined
by
ladies
chapter
seventeen
them
senators
that
put
the
kibosh
on
that
racetrack
bill
can
consider
themselves
as
personal
friends
of
every
chorus
fluff
that
ever
scanned
a
dope
sheet
remarked
sabrina
the
show
girl
as
she
alighted
from
a
new
big
automobile
pipe
the
it
all
mine
name
on
every
piece
and
i
am
personally
thankful
to
those
gents
that
i
am
the
proud
possessor
of
the
same
did
i
catch
well
i
should
hope
so
dear
i
landed
this
buzz
wagon
out
of
a
ten
dollar
pike
bet
can
you
surpass
it
talk
about
playing
in
luck
wait
until
i
touch
wood
wilbur
says
betting
on
the
races
beats
trifling
with
the
affections
of
an
expense
account
all
to
pieces
you
know
that
though
i
lead
a
simple
and
uneventful
existence
the
inheritance
that
was
left
me
was
pretty
near
all
in
and
it
was
either
up
to
me
to
get
married
get
a
job
on
one
of
the
roofs
or
catch
a
live
one
and
i
thought
the
best
of
all
the
evils
was
to
catch
the
aforementioned
live
one
i
am
not
one
of
these
janes
that
goes
dotty
over
the
and
though
i
always
sit
up
until
the
morning
telegraph
comes
out
on
the
street
the
racing
news
is
not
the
first
thing
i
turn
to
wilbur
show
closes
in
a
couple
of
weeks
and
he
is
going
to
the
island
for
the
summer
can
that
old
stuff
i
mean
coney
not
blackwell
i
been
piking
around
for
a
hunch
for
some
time
and
just
the
other
evening
i
was
out
with
a
party
who
is
interested
in
the
bet
placing
business
at
all
of
the
big
tracks
and
he
said
he
was
hep
to
a
few
killings
and
any
time
i
would
come
out
he
would
give
them
to
me
and
i
could
play
the
other
books
knowing
that
he
had
influence
i
naturally
took
an
interest
in
him
but
say
this
is
a
long
sad
story
and
ah
certainly
i
knew
you
could
not
suppress
your
southern
hospitality
much
longer
that
is
i
hoped
you
could
yes
waiter
bring
me
a
long
one
well
i
took
a
peep
at
my
about
a
week
ago
and
decided
that
it
was
me
for
the
track
i
meets
this
wop
and
he
certainly
lands
me
in
right
he
gives
me
a
twenty
case
note
and
the
card
i
got
the
twenty
changed
and
plants
ten
of
it
in
the
lisle
thread
bank
making
up
my
mind
that
no
matter
what
happened
the
day
would
not
be
i
plays
his
tip
at
to
on
the
first
race
and
ketches
out
of
that
ninety
i
plant
forty
still
following
the
kind
gentleman
advice
i
pikes
the
fifty
on
a
dog
in
the
second
race
and
he
never
does
come
in
can
you
beat
that
this
betting
person
picks
the
whole
card
but
this
one
race
i
lose
my
fifty
and
was
thinking
seriously
of
going
home
when
i
got
a
yen
to
try
it
again
so
i
dug
up
a
twenty
out
of
the
hose
honest
it
nearly
broke
my
heart
to
separate
myself
from
that
roll
but
i
just
had
to
do
it
i
get
twenty
to
one
go
into
hysterics
at
the
quarter
faint
at
the
half
but
come
to
in
time
to
see
my
money
coming
in
so
far
ahead
it
looked
as
if
he
was
out
for
a
pleasure
trip
can
you
see
me
with
that
in
my
mit
talk
about
throwing
fits
why
i
had
the
leamy
ladies
looking
like
children
romping
on
the
nursery
floor
there
was
nothing
to
it
i
had
a
hunch
to
grab
the
bundle
and
beat
it
for
home
and
crawl
under
the
bed
and
then
i
had
another
hunch
that
told
me
to
stick
for
the
big
show
i
plant
one
century
in
my
war
bag
and
get
seven
to
two
on
the
next
with
the
other
three
i
win
then
i
do
want
to
go
home
i
felt
but
just
then
a
gentleman
introduced
himself
to
me
and
we
went
and
had
a
little
drink
that
made
me
feel
better
and
so
i
ditched
the
purveyor
of
refreshments
and
fled
to
the
clubhouse
there
is
nothing
more
to
tell
except
that
i
could
lose
and
i
came
home
in
an
automobile
with
my
clothes
so
full
of
this
evergreen
stuff
that
i
looked
as
if
i
had
spavins
or
something
else
i
made
on
the
day
which
is
not
so
bad
for
a
poor
fluff
like
me
that
night
the
gentleman
who
gave
me
the
tips
called
me
up
and
wanted
his
original
twenty
back
saying
the
public
got
all
his
roll
can
you
beat
that
i
told
him
i
thought
he
was
a
moonstone
sport
and
to
never
darken
my
door
again
he
needed
money
bad
and
through
a
friend
i
let
him
have
a
couple
of
thou
on
this
machine
ai
i
the
business
woman
wilbur
and
i
have
just
been
riding
ourselves
to
death
ever
since
he
has
been
acting
awful
lately
ever
since
he
heard
that
friar
weber
and
friar
field
were
going
to
appear
together
at
the
festival
he
has
been
soused
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
restrain
him
from
kissing
phil
mindel
in
the
cadillac
the
other
evening
he
just
do
care
what
he
does
have
you
bought
your
tickets
let
me
see
i
have
six
choice
ones
here
in
the
seventh
row
you
want
to
bring
your
family
of
course
it
will
be
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
nothing
like
it
seen
before
under
one
canvas
for
stellar
attractions
it
going
to
have
barnum
looking
like
a
sunday
school
entertainment
yes
sir
and
i
personally
will
be
there
like
the
trinity
chimes
alla
mcsweeney
has
gone
and
blown
herself
for
one
of
these
racecourse
hats
you
know
these
big
things
that
have
a
track
around
the
outside
while
i
do
not
wish
to
injure
the
poor
dear
still
i
will
say
that
she
certainly
looks
one
of
these
jap
umbrellas
you
know
she
is
such
a
skinny
thing
honest
this
new
hip
style
they
are
boosting
this
season
just
saved
her
life
she
was
getting
saddle
galls
from
carrying
so
many
naturals
i
would
say
this
unless
i
absolutely
knew
and
of
course
i
have
seen
her
early
in
the
morning
when
you
have
there
are
little
confidences
us
girls
exchange
in
the
privacy
of
our
boudoirs
that
would
never
do
for
the
ear
of
a
man
she
tried
to
get
a
job
as
one
of
those
girls
in
love
waltz
but
the
manager
told
her
she
had
better
go
with
a
circus
she
naturally
queried
and
he
the
rude
thing
told
her
she
could
get
a
job
as
a
that
why
she
could
never
get
a
job
with
the
held
show
she
was
all
right
in
low
neck
but
when
it
came
to
tights
well
you
know
bowlegs
never
did
appeal
to
the
front
row
mind
you
i
would
say
a
thing
that
would
hurt
her
character
the
least
bit
but
you
should
have
seen
the
way
she
carried
on
when
she
was
out
in
chicago
you
know
that
anyone
who
runs
around
with
those
la
salle
street
spendthrifts
loses
class
anyway
and
she
just
tore
around
that
north
side
something
scandalous
and
till
my
dying
day
i
never
will
forget
the
scene
she
and
the
comedian
wife
had
on
the
platform
in
that
dear
peoria
alla
bless
her
heart
she
is
a
good
soul
is
a
flighty
creature
and
she
accepted
the
attentions
of
the
comedian
which
his
wife
was
not
supposed
to
be
jerry
to
but
one
day
some
gabby
girl
put
wifey
next
we
were
all
down
to
the
station
waiting
for
the
train
to
come
in
when
up
romps
wifey
to
this
doll
who
is
making
the
big
talk
with
a
chorus
man
just
shows
you
what
extent
she
will
go
for
company
she
was
talking
to
this
chorus
man
and
wifey
capers
up
to
her
and
says
been
flirting
with
my
husband
have
you
and
hauling
off
wifey
hangs
one
on
alla
map
that
is
a
thing
of
beauty
and
a
joy
forever
bing
goes
alla
to
the
platform
down
and
out
she
was
in
such
a
trance
that
we
had
to
rub
her
hands
and
borrow
a
drink
from
the
press
agent
who
came
back
with
the
show
to
see
if
he
could
get
his
salary
before
she
would
come
to
pale
why
that
girl
was
so
white
that
her
number
eighteen
looked
like
big
gobs
of
red
paint
on
each
cheek
i
never
saw
a
girl
so
surprised
in
my
life
for
the
nonce
she
was
nonplussed
she
did
know
what
to
make
of
it
when
she
did
you
should
have
heard
the
language
she
used
it
is
not
for
me
to
tell
it
in
a
respectable
crowd
for
i
only
use
it
to
estelle
that
my
maid
when
she
pulls
my
hair
but
it
was
certainly
not
fit
for
publication
in
a
family
newspaper
she
continually
getting
into
trouble
if
it
ai
one
thing
another
it
a
wonder
to
me
she
has
been
pinched
oftener
than
she
has
i
never
will
forget
one
time
she
was
out
riding
with
a
handsome
gentleman
from
pittsburg
in
a
cab
and
while
leaning
on
his
shoulder
his
diamond
scarfpin
got
caught
in
her
teeth
she
being
a
bashful
young
thing
then
well
when
she
takes
her
head
off
his
shoulder
the
pin
naturally
comes
along
too
and
then
she
got
afraid
that
he
would
think
she
was
trying
to
nick
it
so
she
stuck
the
pin
in
her
hat
band
intending
to
restore
it
on
the
way
home
but
in
the
next
cafe
they
stopped
in
she
picked
a
fight
and
left
him
in
a
huff
would
you
believe
it
that
guy
had
the
nerve
to
come
around
the
next
day
and
declare
that
she
had
pinched
the
bauble
and
threaten
to
land
her
in
the
booby
hatch
if
she
did
come
across
and
they
call
that
chivalry
no
true
gentleman
would
ever
threaten
to
have
a
lady
sent
up
did
he
get
his
pin
well
i
should
say
not
she
threw
such
a
strong
bluff
about
suing
him
for
defamation
of
character
that
he
came
across
with
two
hundred
cold
to
keep
her
quiet
but
do
breathe
this
to
a
soul
unless
they
promise
not
to
tell
i
would
have
it
get
out
that
i
ever
said
anything
about
her
for
worlds
for
though
we
are
the
best
of
friends
i
am
leaving
her
no
opening
to
hand
me
one
do
think
for
a
minute
that
i
have
a
past
i
am
afraid
to
bring
before
me
my
fair
young
life
has
been
as
quiet
and
uneventful
as
an
old
mill
stream
fact
you
see
still
water
runs
deep
and
the
race
is
not
always
to
the
swift
and
goodness
knows
i
would
have
no
one
say
that
about
me
i
a
bohemian
whatever
that
is
lots
of
dames
i
know
have
pasts
why
every
time
you
mention
sid
eusons
to
laura
she
nearly
coughs
up
a
spasm
and
to
even
breathe
medicine
show
to
a
certain
leading
man
i
know
he
will
immediately
cut
you
off
his
calling
list
the
benefit
business
is
not
as
prosperous
this
year
as
it
has
been
heretofore
i
know
several
parties
that
have
actually
lost
money
on
them
now
that
lent
is
over
i
am
going
to
have
a
good
time
i
always
observe
lent
some
way
this
year
i
swore
off
refusing
drinks
or
suppers
wilbur
and
i
expect
to
be
made
one
as
soon
as
he
locates
his
next
season
job
he
got
one
in
sight
that
looks
pretty
good
a
certain
party
has
signed
for
it
but
wilbur
gets
it
if
this
party
drops
dead
so
now
wilbur
is
following
him
around
telling
him
that
he
looks
poorly
we
ought
to
be
very
happy
when
we
get
married
for
wilbur
will
be
out
ahead
of
a
show
all
season
and
i
will
be
here
in
new
york
what
more
would
a
happy
bridal
couple
desire
well
i
must
toddle
along
as
the
hour
is
late
and
my
automobile
is
getting
impatient
be
good
and
do
forget
that
you
promised
on
your
word
and
honor
to
take
six
tickets
for
the
friar
festival
from
me
say
party
if
you
need
any
change
give
me
the
office
and
i
will
slip
it
to
you
sabrina
makes
a
few
remarks
concerning
a
bark
who
is
trying
to
convert
the
and
questions
the
propriety
of
going
on
an
extended
yachting
cruise
with
a
grass
widow
for
a
chaperone
chapter
eighteen
say
remarked
sabrina
as
we
reached
her
table
the
other
evening
did
you
hear
the
gladsome
tidings
some
bark
is
going
to
caper
in
this
country
from
dear
old
lunnon
and
deal
out
religion
to
the
fluffs
of
the
merry
merry
can
you
surpass
it
he
is
going
to
slip
it
to
us
in
our
tea
like
knockout
drops
i
guess
gee
can
you
see
him
distributing
tracts
to
that
mob
it
a
cinch
that
they
will
make
good
curl
papers
anyway
the
only
way
to
convert
most
of
these
dames
is
to
wait
until
the
morning
after
a
birthday
party
and
work
the
remorse
gag
before
they
have
a
chance
to
get
a
bracer
for
their
hangover
can
you
see
him
taking
a
bunch
of
them
out
on
a
picnic
like
he
did
in
england
claremont
or
far
rockaway
for
theirs
and
if
he
did
come
across
with
the
big
feed
with
the
necessary
liquid
trimmings
it
would
be
the
tar
and
feathers
for
his
i
have
had
several
wine
agents
try
to
convert
me
but
i
always
stick
to
the
same
brand
let
him
come
over
and
we
will
show
him
a
time
that
will
make
old
pap
dowie
reception
look
like
a
twinkle
at
that
us
chorus
dames
ai
so
worse
of
course
there
are
a
bunch
of
shines
in
the
aggregation
but
i
guess
if
you
kept
tab
you
would
find
out
that
about
of
them
slide
for
home
as
soon
as
they
get
the
cosmetic
off
their
eyelashes
it
the
other
tenth
that
try
to
be
the
human
night
keys
that
crab
the
act
for
the
whole
works
there
more
dolls
keeping
their
little
sisters
in
convents
than
there
is
ones
buying
shoes
the
poor
jane
has
to
go
somewhere
to
make
her
forget
the
blooming
show
shop
a
bunch
of
these
clucks
jump
all
over
the
villages
ladies
of
the
court
and
think
it
their
fault
that
the
price
of
lobsters
is
so
high
maybe
the
price
of
lobsters
is
high
but
did
you
ever
see
a
chorus
girl
buy
one
for
herself
an
actress
gets
handed
hers
at
every
stage
of
the
game
just
because
a
few
make
the
big
noise
these
old
cranks
are
always
laying
for
a
chance
to
get
a
little
limelight
and
they
naturally
make
the
big
talk
about
people
that
are
in
the
public
eye
and
those
that
they
know
nothing
about
they
should
either
furnish
those
guys
with
a
muzzle
or
give
them
a
pike
at
the
inside
of
the
show
business
so
that
they
would
either
keep
their
trap
shut
or
know
what
they
are
talking
about
i
will
admit
that
there
are
some
grand
wonders
in
this
business
but
that
is
no
reason
why
the
whole
game
should
be
crabbed
and
all
get
the
pan
for
the
actions
of
a
few
you
all
know
that
i
am
broad
minded
i
believe
that
everybody
should
have
a
good
time
if
they
can
keep
sober
of
course
i
do
mean
painfully
sober
but
not
to
get
disgustingly
disgusting
so
that
they
have
to
be
dragged
to
the
taxi
that
i
call
going
too
far
and
entirely
unnecessary
if
a
fluff
commences
to
get
too
moist
around
the
lamps
she
should
either
plead
a
headache
and
slide
for
the
curled
hair
or
throw
her
drinks
on
the
floor
when
the
host
is
holding
hands
or
exchanging
quips
with
one
of
the
other
ladies
in
the
party
drink
is
an
awful
thing
especially
the
next
morning
thanks
to
wilbur
teaching
i
take
a
spoonful
of
olive
oil
every
evening
before
i
duck
the
hut
so
i
can
sit
in
with
the
best
and
have
the
seating
capacity
of
a
bonded
warehouse
i
pray
thee
do
not
breathe
these
little
maidenish
confidences
for
it
might
make
hard
feeling
between
me
and
some
of
my
gentlemen
friends
i
have
had
to
get
checked
at
numerous
places
of
refreshment
wilbur
is
so
busy
getting
ready
for
the
friars
festival
that
you
chase
a
word
out
of
him
about
anything
else
erlanger
lee
schubert
lew
dockstader
and
fred
thompson
have
all
kicked
in
for
their
boxes
and
it
is
expected
that
a
few
more
will
realize
the
merits
of
the
attraction
and
kick
in
this
week
to
see
the
paper
they
have
had
given
to
them
you
think
it
was
the
storeroom
of
the
bailey
show
i
ai
saying
nothing
but
you
just
wait
until
those
guys
get
through
with
the
brushes
they
are
going
to
give
friar
green
the
job
of
tacking
cards
because
he
is
quick
on
his
feet
the
big
festival
comes
off
next
thursday
so
if
you
have
bought
your
seats
it
time
to
get
busy
it
will
be
the
one
best
bet
in
the
show
line
this
season
just
think
weber
and
fields
are
going
to
appear
together
for
the
first
time
in
years
honest
i
am
so
excited
over
the
affair
that
i
can
hardly
wait
wilbur
got
two
seats
in
the
first
row
and
i
be
there
with
new
frock
on
my
hair
in
a
braid
and
my
feet
in
the
orchestra
pit
between
the
festival
and
the
new
clubhouse
it
got
charley
cook
running
around
in
circles
and
wells
hawks
is
so
busy
doping
out
stuff
that
i
saw
him
pass
an
elephant
the
other
day
without
speaking
to
it
harry
alward
is
working
three
shifts
every
day
and
the
whole
blooming
gang
have
gone
so
noodley
that
they
wo
even
stop
to
buy
me
a
drink
and
you
can
take
it
from
me
that
when
those
guys
overlook
a
chance
to
do
something
for
somebody
in
distress
something
has
gone
wrong
or
there
is
a
big
hen
on
what
was
i
talking
about
oh
yes
have
you
heard
the
latest
gossip
alla
mcsweeney
is
wearing
widow
cocktails
on
the
outside
of
taxicabs
now
that
poor
dear
has
to
swallow
a
sinker
with
everything
she
inhales
and
she
always
comes
up
bright
and
cheerful
with
her
face
to
the
pane
waiting
for
the
next
one
i
seen
her
go
under
four
times
in
an
evening
and
though
a
little
pale
she
is
always
there
with
the
chimes
when
the
curtain
drops
yes
i
put
on
my
light
ones
some
two
weeks
ago
i
got
jerry
that
there
would
be
some
class
to
the
humidity
so
i
made
the
quick
change
i
can
not
decide
yet
what
to
do
for
the
summer
i
do
know
whether
to
go
down
to
bath
beach
and
take
a
cottage
go
to
the
mountains
or
go
back
to
emporia
for
a
trip
i
got
run
out
of
that
hick
hamlet
the
last
time
i
was
there
and
i
am
afraid
if
i
go
back
i
might
get
lynched
you
can
never
tell
what
those
emotional
tillers
of
the
soil
are
going
to
do
next
why
they
are
just
as
liable
to
vote
for
bryan
as
not
i
have
been
invited
out
to
far
rockaway
for
a
week
or
two
corse
payton
is
going
to
make
his
summer
home
out
there
and
if
he
is
within
a
radius
of
ten
miles
i
know
we
are
slated
for
the
one
grand
time
he
is
so
full
of
iowa
gallantry
that
he
would
let
even
a
dog
go
by
without
offering
it
a
highball
he
just
that
soft
hearted
he
got
a
young
hotel
out
there
and
the
bars
are
down
for
any
of
his
friends
some
of
us
girls
are
talking
about
getting
a
houseboat
and
leading
the
simple
the
chances
are
it
will
fall
through
most
everything
we
dope
out
does
that
the
trouble
with
us
actresses
we
get
a
wild
idea
and
work
it
to
death
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
somebody
says
buy
and
the
stuff
is
off
we
could
have
lots
of
fun
on
a
houseboat
if
it
had
a
cool
cellar
i
certainly
do
love
to
go
bathing
by
moonlight
it
so
romantic
there
a
certain
party
of
some
prominence
on
wall
street
that
wants
me
to
be
one
of
a
party
on
board
his
yacht
as
his
wife
is
going
to
europe
for
the
summer
but
i
do
know
about
these
yachting
parties
for
there
has
been
so
much
scandal
about
some
of
them
that
i
am
afraid
it
will
lacerate
my
reputation
you
know
above
all
things
i
must
be
careful
with
that
especially
now
that
i
am
going
to
become
a
bride
yep
wilbur
and
i
expect
to
pull
off
the
wedding
bell
specialty
early
in
june
or
as
soon
as
the
season
opens
at
saratoga
i
think
a
young
married
couple
can
have
such
a
nice
quiet
time
in
saratoga
if
they
go
there
on
their
bridal
trip
and
the
season
is
opened
there
is
so
many
society
people
and
others
there
that
life
never
drags
i
remember
i
was
there
on
my
first
wedding
tour
but
my
husband
with
me
what
did
you
know
i
had
been
married
certainly
i
have
and
i
am
betraying
no
confidences
when
i
declare
myself
yes
i
have
been
married
and
to
saratoga
on
my
wedding
trip
my
husband
accompany
me
because
he
was
with
another
show
i
never
had
such
an
extended
bridal
trip
all
stands
i
was
with
a
musical
comedy
at
the
time
and
i
met
my
husband
in
racine
wis
i
know
that
an
awful
place
to
meet
anybody
even
your
husband
but
this
is
a
sad
and
true
tale
he
was
the
leading
juvenile
with
a
show
and
such
a
handsome
thing
you
never
saw
on
the
stage
honest
to
hear
him
spring
that
hokum
you
would
have
thought
he
believed
it
i
know
he
passed
the
same
line
of
dope
out
to
me
and
i
fell
for
it
what
more
could
you
ask
i
was
a
young
and
trusting
thing
then
having
been
in
the
business
only
one
season
so
i
was
not
up
to
the
proper
point
to
believe
no
man
until
he
makes
good
he
introduced
himself
to
me
after
the
performance
and
as
we
were
laying
off
there
waiting
for
the
angel
to
come
across
with
the
necessary
funds
for
us
to
continue
our
successful
tour
i
had
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
listen
to
his
line
of
chatter
he
handed
it
over
so
strong
that
i
took
it
all
in
and
one
day
when
he
sought
my
hand
i
nailed
him
to
the
mast
and
we
beat
it
for
the
justice
of
the
peace
and
were
made
one
his
show
closed
shortly
after
that
and
i
had
to
learn
to
send
him
money
he
got
so
proud
and
stuck
up
that
he
would
even
hunt
for
a
job
until
at
last
it
got
so
unbearable
that
i
had
to
get
a
divorce
he
was
a
gay
and
festive
young
thing
and
though
i
left
town
the
day
we
were
married
i
still
look
upon
him
as
my
first
husband
no
i
never
have
seen
him
since
but
we
did
a
great
deal
of
corresponding
especially
when
he
needed
money
if
you
could
get
clarence
yes
that
was
his
name
ai
it
a
scream
if
you
could
get
clarence
soused
he
was
the
boy
comic
honest
i
have
seen
him
bring
a
smile
out
of
a
head
waiter
he
was
the
real
spendthrift
why
every
day
he
was
courting
me
in
racine
he
would
take
me
down
and
let
me
look
at
the
lake
for
hours
at
a
time
and
often
he
would
tell
me
he
was
going
to
take
me
boat
riding
shows
what
a
piker
i
was
if
i
knew
what
i
do
now
i
would
have
sprung
a
laugh
and
told
him
if
he
wanted
my
fair
young
heart
he
would
have
to
show
me
more
excitement
than
a
watch
meeting
my
how
i
do
run
on
here
i
got
to
sell
a
couple
more
seats
for
the
festival
for
it
is
coming
off
a
week
from
this
coming
thursday
and
i
want
to
have
all
the
other
girls
faded
what
must
you
go
say
party
take
it
from
me
break
open
your
bank
and
count
your
pennies
for
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
she
discusses
the
advisability
of
chorus
girls
charging
time
for
their
company
like
a
taxicab
she
goes
for
a
sail
on
the
river
and
the
party
meets
with
several
accidents
before
finally
having
a
wreck
chapter
nineteen
gee
kid
i
can
scarce
restrain
myself
remarked
sabrina
the
show
girl
as
we
met
her
on
the
street
the
big
show
comes
off
thursday
afternoon
and
me
why
i
be
there
dressed
up
like
a
circus
take
it
from
me
it
a
bet
you
do
want
to
overlook
i
seen
a
guy
go
up
to
the
managers
and
wave
in
their
faces
for
the
box
office
receipts
and
all
he
got
was
the
cold
cruel
laugh
of
scorn
the
clubhouse
had
its
official
opening
last
night
and
as
yet
none
of
those
that
were
in
attendance
have
appeared
upon
the
scene
i
saying
a
word
but
i
bet
they
had
an
awful
time
them
friars
are
great
people
i
been
the
busy
little
bee
all
week
trying
to
get
some
tickets
but
i
guess
they
are
all
sold
out
all
of
the
guys
are
clamoring
for
gallery
seats
behind
posts
and
anything
less
than
for
one
of
the
seats
is
considered
as
car
fare
wilbur
went
to
the
opening
of
the
new
clubhouse
last
night
and
i
got
a
from
him
this
morning
saying
he
was
going
home
and
get
some
sleep
say
party
was
you
up
to
the
friars
convention
last
sunday
talk
about
fun
this
sixty
laughs
in
sixty
minutes
stunt
looked
like
a
methodist
watch
meeting
honest
i
felt
sorry
for
miss
piatt
of
merry
widow
bunch
she
was
elected
to
represent
that
outfit
by
the
whole
company
saturday
night
and
then
none
of
the
girls
showed
up
to
vote
for
her
the
funny
thing
of
the
whole
works
was
that
miss
sara
from
the
bill
show
nearly
won
at
that
gee
did
you
hearken
to
the
cadenza
she
turned
loose
indian
comic
opera
fine
business
i
am
glad
josephine
cohan
got
it
she
a
nice
girl
though
louise
dresser
is
all
right
at
that
beban
was
the
foxy
guy
every
time
anybody
did
show
up
from
any
company
he
would
claim
that
he
was
the
delegate
and
put
the
thing
through
was
al
davis
the
busy
party
corbett
thought
the
thing
all
out
and
davis
did
the
hard
work
and
then
every
friar
for
miles
around
put
in
their
little
gab
and
told
davis
how
it
should
be
done
did
you
ever
notice
that
the
party
inside
the
taxi
knows
more
about
running
it
than
the
chauffeur
al
was
wise
he
paid
no
attention
to
their
words
of
advice
and
that
why
the
thing
was
a
success
too
many
chefs
spoil
the
cheese
sandwich
them
my
words
and
they
go
as
they
lay
hank
green
got
sore
i
spoke
to
him
so
i
wo
do
it
any
more
wilbur
and
i
are
to
be
united
in
wedlock
next
week
and
we
are
going
on
our
wedding
tour
where
it
will
be
goodness
only
knows
it
may
be
only
to
canarsie
or
far
rockaway
since
he
met
me
he
has
planted
a
bunch
of
change
and
a
gentleman
friend
of
mine
gave
him
a
few
tips
on
the
market
and
he
got
what
he
claims
is
a
tidy
sum
he
talking
about
taking
a
trip
to
europe
such
a
chance
what
license
have
we
in
that
neck
of
woods
i
told
him
to
take
a
ride
over
the
williamsburg
bridge
and
that
would
give
him
all
the
europe
he
wanted
he
wants
to
go
over
there
and
bring
back
a
couple
of
big
vaudeville
acts
and
make
a
bunch
of
money
rats
i
tell
him
rats
what
does
he
know
about
vaudeville
acts
some
of
these
wops
that
go
across
never
get
it
out
of
their
systems
all
you
hear
is
i
was
in
london
i
remember
the
time
i
met
ted
marks
in
maxim
maxim
is
in
paris
you
know
my
dear
it
gives
me
a
sharp
stinging
pain
those
burgs
such
a
much
you
can
get
just
as
good
things
to
drink
right
here
in
new
york
so
i
says
to
him
the
use
of
making
a
fool
trip
like
that
but
he
noodly
on
the
subject
and
spends
half
of
his
spare
time
reading
trips
in
the
old
world
in
the
latin
quarter
ways
to
avoid
tipping
and
all
that
kind
of
junk
a
trip
to
asbury
park
would
satisfy
me
just
as
well
alia
mcsweeney
judge
gave
her
a
new
automobile
the
other
day
and
we
had
a
match
race
on
the
merrick
road
honest
the
way
my
car
left
her
tied
to
the
post
was
a
crime
we
both
stopped
drinking
three
hours
before
the
race
commenced
so
that
our
nerves
would
be
in
good
condition
she
may
be
a
good
chorus
girl
but
she
certainly
is
a
bum
racer
i
beat
her
by
two
dogs
six
chickens
and
a
lamp
post
i
would
have
got
a
milk
wagon
only
wilbur
carelessly
blew
the
horn
and
scared
him
up
a
side
street
after
the
race
the
loser
had
to
treat
the
winner
to
the
big
eats
i
ca
tell
you
what
we
had
but
i
can
say
this
much
if
she
loses
another
race
the
judge
will
have
to
go
over
to
the
corporations
eat
we
had
the
best
there
was
gee
i
am
sore
on
this
racing
thing
you
know
i
went
down
there
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
chased
the
books
up
a
tree
i
prance
down
there
the
other
day
and
they
had
me
going
some
i
had
a
crowd
of
inside
info
and
what
do
i
do
but
let
a
wop
tout
me
out
of
it
and
play
his
horse
i
lost
just
five
hundred
cold
ones
by
the
deal
and
i
sure
does
give
this
guy
a
laying
out
i
says
to
him
license
you
got
to
give
a
lady
a
bum
steer
like
that
here
i
go
and
plant
my
fifty
on
the
dog
you
handed
me
at
to
and
the
to
shot
i
was
going
to
play
wins
where
my
comeback
i
ask
you
as
a
lady
where
do
i
get
off
he
offered
to
kick
in
with
the
fifty
i
lost
but
i
put
up
such
an
awful
roar
that
he
gave
me
two
hundred
more
to
ease
my
aching
heart
i
lose
him
in
the
crowd
and
then
take
a
peek
at
the
entries
again
and
find
the
i
intended
betting
on
did
even
start
of
course
i
could
find
the
party
that
gave
me
the
two
fifty
search
as
i
might
was
that
rotten
luck
i
ran
that
two
fifty
up
to
an
even
thousand
before
the
last
race
and
then
beat
it
for
home
and
mother
the
bunch
went
into
the
fresh
air
fund
along
with
the
rest
i
am
now
trying
to
meet
some
nice
gentleman
who
does
business
in
wall
street
and
get
him
to
make
a
few
conservative
investments
for
me
not
that
i
intend
to
use
any
of
my
own
money
certainly
not
but
it
is
a
good
thing
to
have
a
bank
account
to
flash
so
that
the
boob
will
think
he
will
get
a
comeback
if
he
does
lose
a
gentleman
did
put
some
money
up
on
a
margin
for
me
once
and
then
when
he
got
trimmed
he
came
to
me
for
a
check
and
i
had
to
go
into
hysterics
before
i
could
get
rid
of
him
the
conceited
yen
some
of
these
boobs
have
in
thinking
that
a
fluff
has
nothing
else
to
do
but
sit
in
some
cafe
and
hold
hands
until
daylight
i
am
trying
to
get
the
chorus
girls
union
to
get
together
and
pass
a
law
charging
so
much
for
our
time
just
like
a
taxicab
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
good
idea
lots
of
times
the
supper
ai
worth
the
time
she
wastes
on
the
cluck
they
could
have
a
little
indicator
fastened
to
their
merry
widow
hat
and
as
they
leave
the
stage
door
turn
down
the
flag
and
not
read
the
meter
until
he
had
kissed
you
in
the
hall
and
then
collect
in
that
way
the
doll
would
have
the
price
of
breakfast
and
maybe
a
new
gag
or
something
for
her
wardrobe
it
would
reduce
the
nightly
jam
around
the
stage
door
by
a
whole
lot
did
you
hear
about
the
bunch
of
us
going
yachting
in
gym
bagley
yacht
the
hornet
the
other
day
he
calls
it
the
hornet
because
he
got
stung
when
he
bought
it
the
weather
was
all
to
the
good
the
other
afternoon
so
we
hike
up
to
harlem
and
collar
the
ship
six
of
us
and
after
loading
a
bunch
of
bottled
ballast
on
board
we
started
out
gosh
the
water
was
lovely
gym
do
care
what
becomes
of
the
blooming
barge
as
long
as
it
does
get
lost
you
can
even
sink
it
if
you
mark
the
spot
we
all
leave
our
merry
widow
lids
in
the
boathouse
the
boat
would
hold
them
and
sallied
forth
wilbur
said
he
knew
how
to
sail
a
boat
come
to
find
out
later
it
was
a
stone
boat
he
had
been
educated
on
well
we
elected
him
the
chauffeur
and
after
hoisting
the
sail
the
gallant
craft
with
its
crew
swung
out
into
the
stream
yo
ho
my
lads
yo
ho
the
wind
was
blowing
one
way
and
we
wanted
to
go
the
other
so
after
nearly
wrecking
a
couple
of
tugboats
and
a
brick
scow
we
fixed
the
sail
so
the
wind
would
push
the
boat
right
along
aye
aye
captain
a
fish
by
east
with
the
wind
in
his
teeth
the
sturdy
vessel
was
just
tearing
along
honest
you
could
see
it
move
right
along
just
like
a
clam
when
alla
who
you
all
know
is
the
human
goat
in
trying
to
reach
for
a
bottle
of
beer
that
did
belong
to
her
fell
overboard
it
served
her
right
and
i
told
the
gang
to
hit
her
on
the
nob
with
an
oar
when
she
we
dragged
her
in
however
and
wrapped
her
up
in
a
bunch
of
coats
and
set
her
on
the
front
stoop
of
the
craft
to
dry
she
got
jerry
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
bottle
of
jig
juice
in
the
galley
and
at
once
threw
a
chill
honest
to
see
that
fluff
do
a
stage
chill
would
have
made
a
eel
laugh
ha
ha
in
that
manner
she
shook
so
hard
she
nearly
threw
us
all
out
of
the
scow
so
that
we
finally
had
to
listen
to
her
pleadings
and
pass
her
the
booze
i
was
for
letting
her
shake
so
if
we
wanted
mixed
drinks
al
we
would
have
to
do
was
to
put
the
glass
in
her
mitt
and
say
go
to
it
but
some
of
the
gazabos
in
the
mob
got
a
sympathy
streak
and
let
her
have
it
a
let
her
had
it
all
right
all
right
the
outside
of
the
bottle
right
on
the
marcel
the
subterfuges
these
janes
will
indulge
in
to
accomplish
their
ends
makes
my
goat
jump
the
barrier
nothing
else
marred
our
pleasant
little
sail
up
the
river
except
when
we
opened
the
lunch
box
we
found
only
one
sandwich
and
no
one
would
eat
it
everybody
wanted
to
trade
their
interest
in
it
for
a
bottle
of
beer
and
there
was
nearly
a
riot
it
was
finally
settled
by
wilbur
who
is
always
the
boy
when
it
comes
to
emergencies
he
took
the
sandwich
and
threw
it
overboard
and
each
and
every
member
of
the
famished
crew
had
another
eyedropper
full
of
suds
if
it
had
been
for
him
we
would
be
out
there
yet
we
had
got
up
to
nearly
opposite
street
by
this
time
and
some
of
the
less
experienced
members
of
the
jolly
gang
were
commencing
to
worry
that
they
would
never
see
broadway
again
and
stationed
a
lookout
in
the
bow
to
find
albany
aye
aye
the
deck
water
sighted
on
the
port
beam
on
duty
captain
these
noodley
dames
were
strong
for
reversing
and
returning
to
our
harbor
which
we
had
not
seen
for
these
many
years
ah
the
brave
sailor
lad
alas
he
had
to
remain
away
from
home
at
night
so
wilbur
started
to
turn
the
boat
around
i
think
he
must
have
thought
he
was
driving
a
street
car
for
instead
of
reversing
like
any
white
man
would
he
pulled
off
an
evolution
that
was
a
peach
all
of
the
wind
ducked
out
of
the
sail
gag
for
a
minute
and
the
boat
spun
around
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
filled
again
and
bingo
the
scow
slowly
lays
over
on
her
side
an
dies
the
outfit
fell
into
the
water
kerplunk
i
think
i
touched
the
bottom
nine
times
before
i
grabbed
the
side
of
the
boat
i
remember
distinctly
of
passing
a
fish
so
often
that
we
got
on
speaking
terms
when
i
got
the
briny
out
of
my
lamps
and
took
a
pike
around
there
was
the
whole
works
clinging
to
the
side
of
the
boat
looking
like
a
flock
of
wet
cats
the
remarks
they
made
to
wilbur
i
would
not
repeat
here
for
he
is
to
be
my
future
husband
the
water
was
as
cold
as
a
flat
in
the
winter
time
and
nothing
in
sight
one
of
the
dames
i
would
be
surprised
if
it
was
that
alla
party
suggested
that
we
lash
a
man
to
the
rigging
and
let
him
look
for
help
another
was
strong
for
turning
the
flag
upside
down
as
a
signal
of
distress
louie
zweibaum
nearly
drowned
because
he
had
to
use
both
hands
to
tell
her
that
the
rigging
was
under
water
we
all
between
shivers
turned
loose
a
rebel
yell
for
help
and
pretty
soon
along
comes
a
tugboat
bound
downtown
that
drove
up
alongside
and
after
the
captain
found
out
that
we
had
money
they
hoisted
us
on
deck
and
took
the
sloop
for
a
tow
take
it
from
me
i
was
never
so
glad
to
get
near
a
fire
in
my
life
the
skipper
of
the
cheese
let
us
get
in
the
engine
room
and
dry
out
can
you
see
that
wet
bunch
of
fluffs
with
all
the
highlight
off
and
their
marcels
around
their
necks
i
bet
there
was
a
whole
lot
of
surprises
sprung
when
the
true
complexion
began
to
show
up
we
got
fairly
well
fixed
up
by
the
time
we
got
down
to
where
we
had
to
go
to
get
the
rest
of
our
stuff
and
when
we
once
again
touched
mother
earth
and
the
captain
of
the
boat
had
touched
us
we
took
it
on
the
run
for
a
cafe
and
let
me
tell
you
the
market
price
on
hot
drinks
closed
strong
in
harlem
that
night
we
fixed
gym
boat
up
and
gave
it
back
to
him
the
next
day
nobody
caught
cold
and
everything
in
the
garden
lovely
now
dearie
i
can
call
you
dearie
for
i
am
soon

be
a
married
woman

big
festival

your

actors

are
given
credit
for
so

up
to
you

help

so
long
do
forget

rush
sabrina

on

gamblers

chapter
twenty
sabrina
was
married
to
wilbur
the
day
after
the
friar
festival
and
we
acted
in
the
capacity
of
best
man
and
were
very
much
in
evidence
in
the
feast
that
followed
we
imprinted
chaste
salutes
on
the
lips
of
the
blushing
bride
until
the
groom
tore
us
asunder
after
the
festivities
sabrina
and
wilbur
disappeared
and
for
the
past
ten
days
their
favorite
cafes
and
loafing
places
have
known
them
not
we
were
just
beginning
to
get
nervous
when
the
postman
brought
the
following
letter
london
dear
party
i
guess
maybe
when
you
pipe
off
this
effusion
you
will
throw
a
foaming
fit
and
fall
in
it
me
and
wilbur
are
now
in
the
city
of
fogs
and
take
it
from
me
it
a
bum
habitation
for
even
a
dog
after
you
and
the
rest
of
the
gang
did
the
shoot
the
chutes
under
the
table
at
the
wedding
breakfast
me
and
his
nobs
grabbed
our
boxes
and
took
it
on
the
lope
for
the
ferry
station
i
thought
we
were
going
to
take
a
wedding
tour
to
asbury
park
or
some
of
the
other
watering
places
but
what
does
wilbur
do
but
sidestep
the
ferry
proposition
and
we
go
prancing
up
to
a
dock
where
a
boat
about
nine
miles
big
was
hitched
and
before
i
had
time
to
give
the
office
to
the
cop
on
the
beat
wilbur
rushes
me
up
the
plank
and
into
the
outfit
honest
it
was
bigger
than
any
of
the
coney
island
boats
i
was
under
the
impression
for
the
nonce
that
it
was
the
night
boat
up
the
hudson
but
i
did
see
a
steward
i
knew
a
guy
who
had
enough
gilt
on
to
be
a
in
the
national
guard
came
floundering
up
and
wilbur
gave
him
his
real
name
and
the
wop
said
way
please
threw
us
into
a
young
elevator
and
we
went
up
a
couple
of
stories
and
along
a
hall
until
we
came
to
a
door
which
the
gee
threw
open
and
said
is
your
stateroom
honest
i
never
saw
such
a
drum
a
great
big
room
with
a
real
bed
instead
of
those
shelve
things
and
off
of
the
room
a
bath
and
we
were
only
to
be
on
the
water
five
days
can
you
beat
it
i
was
the
one
surprised
pup
and
as
soon
as
i
hung
my
widow
on
the
gas
jet
i
asked
wilbur
about
it
he
says
we
are
on
the
ferry
to
europe
and
we
are
going
to
spend
our
honeymoon
across
the
pond
i
says
for
little
sabrina
you
do
get
her
out
of
sight
of
new
york
and
made
a
stab
for
the
rail
by
the
time
i
got
to
it
we
were
in
the
middle
of
the
creek
and
nothing
in
sight
but
a
flock
of
tugboats
and
a
bunch
of
yaps
waving
their
mitts
on
the
dock
take
it
from
me
if
i
had
been
a
bride
i
would
have
cut
up
something
scandalous
but
it
was
too
early
in
the
matrimonial
game
to
start
any
lumpy
work
so
all
i
did
was
to
sit
and
pout
i
know
i
can
always
make
a
hit
when
i
flash
the
pouting
number
gee
what
could
i
do
out
there
in
the
middle
of
the
water
with
a
long
slushy
walk
back
to
the
dock
so
i
did
the
next
best
thing
and
gave
the
high
sign
to
the
steward
to
kick
in
with
a
few
refreshments
which
he
very
graciously
did
say
party
i
ca
tell
you
how
i
felt
to
see
little
old
new
york
slip
away
in
the
distance
that
old
town
is
a
great
old
burg
and
as
i
was
going
to
kick
into
some
other
country
that
i
was
hep
to
i
naturally
felt
kind
of
bumly
we
went
busting
by
the
statue
of
liberty
and
then
on
out
past
the
hook
and
take
it
from
me
if
that
steward
had
come
across
with
the
refreshments
just
at
that
moment
i
would
have
burst
into
tears
as
it
was
i
could
only
address
wilbur
in
a
few
terse
adjectives
and
tell
him
what
i
thought
of
a
person
that
would
pull
off
such
a
low
down
deal
on
an
unsuspecting
fluff
i
want
to
state
right
now
that
though
i
was
but
a
bride
i
called
him
good
and
proper
the
next
morning
we
went
down
to
breakfast
say
they
have
about
ten
meals
a
day
on
one
of
these
scows
and
i
gained
about
twenty
pounds
already
there
was
a
bunch
of
show
people
going
over
on
the
same
boat
and
wilbur
and
i
naturally
cottoned
to
them
we
did
do
a
thing
all
day
but
sit
on
the
deck
and
read
or
walk
around
or
sing
in
the
music
room
sure
they
got
a
real
live
music
room
on
board
as
well
as
a
conservatory
a
gym
and
an
elevator
i
do
know
whether
i
plucked
a
quince
or
not
wilbur
kept
insisting
that
i
go
to
the
table
every
time
they
turned
in
an
alarm
and
i
was
sorta
holding
off
i
did
want
to
lance
the
poor
boy
for
all
his
change
on
the
way
over
but
he
kept
insisting
that
i
eat
and
acted
so
peevish
when
i
that
i
thought
well
if
he
wants
to
spend
his
money
all
right
so
i
eat
so
much
that
i
could
have
crowded
any
more
in
me
with
a
hypo
come
to
find
out
the
food
was
included
in
the
passage
and
we
had
to
pay
for
it
whether
we
ate
it
or
not
that
why
i
am
wondering
if
i
plucked
a
quince
wilbur
was
never
tight
before
we
were
wed
and
you
can
take
it
from
me
that
if
he
starts
to
hold
out
or
draw
down
now
there
is
going
to
be
fine
large
doings
in
the
wilbur
family
from
the
female
delegation
wilbur
was
in
the
smoking
room
the
other
evening
and
got
to
talking
with
what
he
thought
were
a
couple
of
boobs
but
come
to
find
out
they
were
wise
guys
after
sipping
up
a
couple
of
slow
ones
the
guys
propose
a
little
poker
game
wilbur
and
two
other
boobs
fall
for
the
bunk
and
they
open
up
wilbur
after
losing
a
little
junk
gives
the
wise
guys
the
office
that
he
jerry
to
the
fact
that
they
are
playing
with
newspaper
and
lets
them
know
that
if
he
ai
in
on
the
he
belch
these
two
boobs
are
dirty
with
the
evergreen
and
wilbur
got
the
wise
guys
so
leary
for
fear
he
will
tip
his
mitt
and
they
naturally
slip
him
a
big
one
every
time
they
get
a
chance
wilbur
gets
his
money
back
and
everything
is
even
all
around
but
the
wise
guys
are
the
only
ones
who
want
to
lay
down
wilbur
hands
them
a
game
of
cheerful
chatter
and
they
dare
quit
foxy
wilbur
sits
there
until
raking
in
their
money
and
incidentally
corrals
some
that
belongs
to
the
wealthy
wops
in
the
meantime
i
am
doing
the
earnest
conversation
act
with
an
old
dowager
that
i
met
the
second
day
out
and
she
is
telling
me
about
her
country
home
in
devonshire
or
some
other
one
of
these
shire
things
she
sorta
took
a
fancy
to
me
and
insisted
that
wilbur
and
i
should
run
out
there
for
a
which
end
of
the
week
she
did
say
but
i
guess
if
we
go
sunday
we
are
safe
to
hear
this
old
dame
tell
it
she
must
own
about
nine
million
acres
up
in
the
country
and
her
husband
has
all
kinds
of
wild
animals
lions
tigers
elephants
and
all
that
truck
that
are
trained
to
be
shot
she
called
it
a
shooting
lodge
probably
a
branch
of
the
elks
this
old
party
ceases
her
harangue
and
i
beat
it
to
the
and
am
pounding
my
ear
when
wilbur
kicks
in
with
a
souse
on
i
come
out
of
the
hay
and
am
getting
ready
to
call
him
to
a
when
he
flashes
his
bundle
my
anger
vanished
in
a
moment
and
i
just
reach
out
and
cop
the
coin
and
roll
over
and
goes
to
sleep
wilbur
sleeps
on
the
floor
until
i
took
compassion
on
him
and
rolled
him
on
the
lounge
talk
about
your
wifely
devotion
what
i
count
the
roll
in
the
morning
before
i
slip
it
to
the
purser
for
safekeeping
and
it
assayed
which
is
not
half
bad
for
a
night
work
the
wise
guys
come
around
and
offer
wilbur
a
night
to
stay
out
of
the
smoking
room
and
he
wo
do
it
but
tells
them
if
he
catches
them
playing
another
game
during
the
trip
he
will
turn
loose
the
long
rebel
yell
now
the
two
wise
guys
are
sitting
on
deck
reading
lives
of
the
saints
and
making
faces
at
wilbur
every
time
he
goes
romping
by
ai
wilbur
the
saucy
thing
the
last
night
on
board
we
gave
a
concert
for
the
benefit
of
the
seamen
fund
or
something
like
that
and
i
claim
that
it
was
a
classy
affair
i
appeared
and
without
any
brag
or
ostentation
i
can
truthfully
say
that
i
scored
a
great
personal
triumph
it
was
so
much
what
i
did
but
the
winsome
manner
in
which
i
did
it
get
that
wilbur
was
the
manager
of
the
affair
and
did
shake
down
a
cent
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
said
that
a
sailor
needed
all
the
money
he
could
get
and
he
would
be
the
first
man
not
to
take
it
from
them
i
made
my
big
hit
at
the
concert
in
reciting
one
of
the
mates
told
me
that
somebody
does
on
every
trip
but
i
was
the
first
one
that
furnished
scenery
by
letting
down
my
hair
i
wonder
if
he
was
kidding
me
a
great
many
of
the
ladies
on
board
spent
all
their
time
in
playing
bridget
whist
and
after
watching
them
for
a
couple
of
afternoons
they
offered
to
teach
me
the
game
with
a
moderate
limit
i
am
hep
to
this
poker
thing
and
can
look
a
pat
hand
in
the
face
without
a
quiver
of
the
lip
but
i
must
blushingly
admit
that
i
thought
i
was
in
for
a
good
trimming
when
i
got
up
against
those
dames
it
cost
me
about
fifty
dollars
to
learn
and
then
i
had
a
streak
of
beginner
luck
and
before
the
whistle
blew
for
dinner
i
was
several
hundred
to
the
velvet
two
of
the
janes
put
up
a
horrible
holler
about
it
being
a
friendly
game
and
wanted
their
money
back
i
was
going
to
give
it
to
them
because
i
did
want
to
look
any
older
but
one
of
the
others
took
my
part
and
told
me
to
hold
onto
the
gross
the
three
that
did
get
their
back
got
out
their
little
hammers
and
for
a
while
i
had
no
one
to
talk
to
but
myself
or
wilbur
and
he
was
trying
to
dope
out
a
scheme
whereby
he
could
paste
threesheets
on
the
ocean
and
catch
the
incoming
tourists
i
left
him
trying
to
compose
a
wireless
that
would
explain
the
whole
proposition
to
fred
thompson
we
came
in
sight
of
england
or
ireland
or
some
of
those
foolish
islands
early
in
the
morning
and
they
did
look
so
much
barren
island
has
got
faded
for
smell
there
were
nothing
but
long
white
chalk
cliffs
that
a
good
man
with
a
bucket
of
whitewash
could
paint
in
a
week
we
got
into
liverpool
and
loafed
around
town
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
saw
nothing
that
would
cause
any
excitement
the
natives
look
just
the
same
and
dress
just
the
same
as
they
do
in
america
but
you
have
to
go
some
to
understand
what
they
say
gee
you
should
pipe
the
herdics
they
use
for
railroad
cars
in
this
man
england
country
instead
of
making
the
grand
entrance
from
the
end
you
sneak
in
at
the
side
and
sit
in
a
kind
of
a
pew
thing
making
faces
at
some
one
across
the
aisle
wilbur
got
sore
he
blew
himself
for
a
couple
of
tickets
and
the
conductor
i
mean
the
guard
did
come
around
to
collect
them
until
we
go
nearly
into
london
he
wanted
to
bet
an
englishman
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
bly
me
i
mean
a
pound
that
he
could
make
the
same
trip
for
nothing
and
hand
the
guard
a
group
of
chatter
that
would
get
him
all
the
way
into
town
when
we
crawled
out
of
the
caboose
in
london
we
thought
it
was
midnight
but
on
asking
a
cop
my
word
i
mean
bobby
he
said
it
was
nothing
but
a
fog
wilbur
told
him
that
if
he
wanted
him
to
see
much
of
his
blooming
city
he
would
have
to
bring
around
a
dark
lantern
we
called
a
cab
and
started
for
the
savoy
all
true
americans
when
they
go
to
london
stop
at
the
savoy
we
drove
for
about
an
hour
the
horse
gumshoeing
his
way
through
the
dark
until
we
came
to
the
hotel
wilbur
asked
the
cab
driver
how
much
it
was
and
he
named
the
sum
that
if
you
even
suggested
it
to
a
new
york
cabby
he
would
have
you
pinched
after
registering
wilbur
called
marcus
mayer
up
on
the
telephone
he
grabbed
down
the
receiver
and
after
waiting
for
about
half
an
hour
some
dame
said
you
there
nanny
took
the
hurdle
and
he
answered
did
you
think
i
was
playing
pinochle
with
the
king
after
a
sharp
struggle
he
managed
to
get
marcus
hangout
but
he
was
in
so
wilbur
started
out
to
hunt
the
american
bar
alone
in
about
fifteen
minutes
he
came
back
on
the
run
with
a
couple
of
bobbys
about
two
jumps
behind
him
it
seems
that
wilbur
had
found
the
american
bar
and
walked
up
to
it
and
asked
for
a
manhattan
cocktail
because
he
was
getting
homesick
and
the
bartender
said
you
have
it
made
with
scotch
or
irish
sir
naturally
wilbur
hit
him
with
the
first
thing
that
came
handy
which
happened
to
be
a
heavy
beer
mug
the
bartender
was
a
short
sport
and
instead
of
trimming
him
with
a
turns
loose
a
yell
for
the
law
so
wilbur
lopes
on
carelessly
knocking
over
a
couple
of
cops
on
his
way
out
the
two
officers
that
followed
him
to
the
room
were
strong
for
sending
him
to
the
booby
hatch
but
i
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
slip
them
each
a
piece
of
change
and
they
exit
laughing
that
all
that
has
happened
so
far
though
we
just
got
in
town
last
night
and
i
am
writing
this
before
breakfast
oh
no
there
something
else
last
night
wilbur
and
i
started
down
to
dinner
and
they
shooed
him
back
to
put
on
his
evening
clothes
he
met
some
of
the
american
bunch
after
supper
and
it
took
them
three
hours
to
tell
all
the
things
they
did
to
georgie
cohan
when
he
was
over
here
ted
marks
is
right
here
with
his
hair
in
a
braid
and
the
white
carnation
we
will
stay
here
for
about
a
week
and
then
caper
over
to
paris
i
got
a
hunch
that
wilbur
is
fixing
to
leave
me
in
the
outskirts
because
i
heard
him
say
something
about
the
foolishness
of
taking
a
cheese
sandwich
to
a
banquet
will
write
again
soon
platonically
yours
wilbur
is
in
another
row
downstairs
and
i
got
to
go
and
see
what
coming
off
s
