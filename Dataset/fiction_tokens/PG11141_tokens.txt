a
summer
in
leslie
goldthwaite
life
by
whitney
to
the
memory
of
my
dear
friend
maria
cummins
and
of
days
among
the
mountains
made
beautiful
by
her
companionship
i
dedicate
this
little
story
preface
to
real
folks
series
leslie
goldthwaite
was
the
first
of
a
series
of
four
which
grew
from
this
beginning
and
was
written
in
and
the
years
nearly
following
the
first
two
stories
this
and
we
girls
having
been
furnished
by
request
for
the
magazine
our
young
folks
published
at
that
time
with
such
success
by
fields
osgood
and
edited
by
howard
ticknor
and
miss
lucy
larcom
the
last
two
volumes
real
folks
and
the
other
girls
were
asked
for
to
complete
the
set
and
were
not
delayed
by
serial
publication
but
issued
at
once
in
their
order
of
completion
in
book
form
there
is
a
sequence
of
purpose
character
and
incident
in
the
four
stories
of
which
it
is
well
to
remind
new
readers
upon
their
reappearance
in
fresh
editions
they
all
deal
especially
with
and
endeavoring
even
in
the
narration
of
experiences
outside
the
home
and
seeming
to
preclude
its
life
to
keep
for
girlhood
and
womanhood
the
true
motive
and
tendency
through
whatever
temporary
interruption
and
necessity
of
and
toward
the
best
spirit
and
shaping
of
womanly
work
and
surrounding
making
the
the
ideal
one
and
home
itself
the
centre
and
goal
of
effort
and
hope
the
writing
of
the
other
girls
was
interrupted
by
the
great
fire
of
and
the
work
upon
the
women
relief
committee
which
brought
close
contact
and
personal
knowledge
to
reinforce
mere
sympathy
and
theory
and
so
i
hope
into
this
last
of
the
series
a
touch
of
something
that
may
deepen
the
influence
of
them
all
to
stronger
help
i
wish
without
withdrawing
or
superseding
the
special
dedication
of
leslie
goldthwaite
to
the
memory
of
the
dear
friend
with
whom
the
weeks
were
spent
in
which
i
gathered
material
for
leslie
summer
to
remember
in
this
new
presentation
of
the
whole
series
that
other
friend
with
whom
all
the
after
work
in
it
was
associated
and
made
the
first
links
of
a
long
regard
and
fellowship
now
lifted
up
and
reaching
onward
into
the
hopes
and
certainties
of
the
land
o
the
leal
i
wish
to
join
to
my
own
name
in
this
the
name
of
lucy
larcom
which
stands
representative
of
most
brave

leslie
goldthwaite
said
this
standing
in
the
among
her
plants
which
had
been
green
and
flourishing
but
persistently
blossomless
all
winter
and
now
the
spring
days
were
come
cousin
delight
looked
up
and
her
white
ruffling
that
she
was
daintily
hemstitching
fell
to
her
lap
as
she
looked
still
with
a
certain
wide
intentness
in
her
eyes
upon
the
pleasant
window
and
the
bright
fresh
things
it
framed
not
the
least
bright
and
fresh
among
them
was
the
human
creature
in
her
early
girlhood
tender
and
pleasant
in
its
beautiful
leafage
but
waiting
like
any
other
young
and
growing
life
to
prove
what
sort
of
flower
should
come
of
it
now
you
got
one
of
your
cousin
delight
i
see
it
as
elspie
says
leslie
turned
round
with
her
little
green
suspended
in
her
hand
waiting
for
the
thought
to
have
a
thought
and
to
give
it
were
nearly
simultaneous
things
with
cousin
delight
so
true
so
pure
so
unselfish
so
made
to
give
like
perfume
or
music
which
can
not
be
and
be
withheld
were
thoughts
with
her
i
must
say
a
word
before
i
go
further
of
delight
goldthwaite
i
think
of
her
as
of
quite
a
young
person
you
youthful
readers
would
doubtless
have
declared
that
she
was
old
very
old
at
least
for
a
young
lady
she
was
at
this
time
of
which
i
write
leslie
her
young
cousin
was
just
past
the
half
and
catching
up
as
she
said
herself
being
fifteen
leslie
mother
called
miss
goldthwaite
playfully
ladies
delight
and
taking
up
the
idea
half
her
women
friends
knew
her
by
this
significant
and
epigrammatic
title
there
was
something
doubly
pertinent
in
it
she
made
you
think
at
once
of
nothing
so
much
as
a
garden
that
flower
of
many
names
not
of
the
frail
scentless
wild
she
had
been
cultured
to
something
larger
the
violet
nature
was
there
colored
and
shaped
more
richly
and
gifted
with
rare
fragrance
for
those
whose
delicate
sense
could
perceive
it
the
very
face
was
a
pansy
face
with
its
deep
large
eyes
and
golden
brows
and
lashes
the
color
of
her
hair
pale
gold
so
pale
that
careless
people
who
had
perception
only
for
such
beauty
as
can
flash
upon
you
from
a
crowd
or
across
a
said
hastily
that
she
had
brows
or
lashes
and
that
this
spoiled
her
she
was
not
a
beauty
therefore
nor
was
she
in
any
sort
a
belle
she
never
drew
around
her
the
common
attention
that
is
paid
eagerly
to
very
pretty
outwardly
bewitching
girls
and
she
never
seemed
to
care
for
this
at
a
party
she
was
as
apt
as
not
to
sit
in
a
corner
but
the
quiet
people
the
mothers
looking
on
or
the
girls
waiting
for
partners
getting
into
that
same
corner
also
found
the
best
pleasure
of
their
evening
there
there
was
something
about
her
dress
too
that
women
appreciated
most
fully
the
delicate
textures
the
finishings
and
only
those
of
rare
exquisite
lace
the
perfect
harmony
of
the
whole
unobtrusive
toilet
women
looked
at
these
in
wonder
at
the
unerring
instinct
of
her
taste
in
wonder
also
that
they
only
with
each
other
raved
about
her
nobody
had
ever
been
supposed
to
be
devoted
to
her
she
had
never
been
reported
as
engaged
there
had
never
been
any
of
this
sort
of
gossip
about
her
gentlemen
found
her
they
said
hard
to
get
acquainted
with
she
had
not
much
of
the
small
talk
which
must
usually
begin
an
acquaintance
a
few
her
relatives
or
her
elders
or
the
husbands
of
her
intimate
married
friends
understood
and
valued
her
but
it
was
her
girl
friends
and
women
friends
who
knew
her
best
and
declared
that
there
was
nobody
like
her
and
so
came
her
sobriquet
and
the
double
pertinence
of
it
especially
she
was
leslie
goldthwaite
delight
leslie
had
no
sisters
and
her
aunts
were
old
far
older
than
her
mother
on
her
side
a
broken
and
scattered
family
had
left
few
ties
for
her
next
to
her
mother
and
even
closer
in
some
young
sympathies
she
clung
to
cousin
delight
with
this
diversion
we
will
go
back
now
to
her
and
to
her
thought
i
was
thinking
she
said
with
that
intent
look
in
her
eyes
i
often
think
of
how
something
else
was
found
once
having
nothing
but
leaves
and
of
what
came
to
it
i
know
answered
leslie
with
an
evasive
quickness
and
turned
round
with
her
to
her
plants
again
there
was
sometimes
a
bit
of
waywardness
about
leslie
goldthwaite
there
was
a
fitfulness
of
frankness
and
reserve
she
was
eager
for
truth
yet
now
and
then
she
would
thrust
it
aside
she
said
that
nobody
liked
a
nicely
pointed
moral
better
than
she
did
only
she
would
just
as
lief
it
should
be
pointed
at
her
the
fact
was
she
was
in
that
sensitive
state
in
which
many
a
young
girl
finds
herself
when
she
begins
to
ask
and
to
weigh
with
herself
the
great
questions
of
life
and
shrinks
shyly
from
the
open
mention
of
the
very
thing
she
longs
more
fully
to
apprehend
cousin
delight
took
no
notice
it
is
perhaps
likely
that
she
understood
sufficiently
well
for
that
she
turned
toward
the
table
by
which
she
sat
and
pulled
toward
her
a
heavy
atlas
that
lay
open
at
the
map
of
connecticut
beside
it
was
lippincott
gazetteer
open
also
traveling
leslie
yes
i
been
a
charming
journey
this
morning
before
you
came
i
wonder
if
i
ever
travel
in
reality
i
done
a
monstrous
deal
of
it
with
maps
and
gazetteers
this
has
been
one
of
the
stereotyped
tours
it
seems
oh
no
what
the
use
of
doing
niagara
or
the
white
mountains
or
even
new
york
and
philadelphia
and
washington
on
the
map
i
been
one
of
my
little
trips
round
among
the
villages
stopping
wherever
i
found
one
cuddled
in
between
a
river
and
a
hill
or
in
a
little
seashore
nook
those
are
the
places
after
all
that
i
would
hunt
out
if
i
had
plenty
of
money
to
go
where
i
liked
with
it
so
pleasant
to
imagine
how
the
people
live
there
and
what
sort
of
folks
they
would
be
likely
to
be
it
is
so
much
traveling
as
living
round
awhile
in
one
home
and
then
in
another
how
many
different
little
there
are
in
the
world
and
how
queer
it
is
only
really
to
know
about
one
or
two
of
them
what
this
place
you
at
just
now
winsted
yes
there
where
i
brought
up
at
the
end
of
that
bit
of
railroad
it
a
bigger
place
than
i
fancied
though
i
always
steer
clear
of
the
names
that
end
in
they
sure
to
be
stupid
towns
all
grown
up
in
a
minute
with
some
common
man
name
tacked
on
to
them
that
happened
to
build
a
or
something
first
but
winsted
has
such
a
sweet
little
quiet
english
sound
i
know
it
never
with
a
mill
they
make
pins
and
clocks
and
tools
and
machines
there
now
and
it
largest
and
most
prosperous
of
litchfield
county
but
i
do
care
for
the
pins
and
machinery
it
got
a
lake
alongside
of
it
and
still
river
do
that
sound
nice
runs
through
and
there
are
the
great
hills
big
enough
to
put
on
the
map
out
beyond
i
can
fancy
where
the
girls
take
their
sunset
walks
and
the
moonlight
parties
boating
on
the
pond
and
the
way
the
woods
look
round
still
river
oh
yes
that
one
of
the
places
i
mean
to
go
to
leslie
goldthwaite
lived
in
one
of
the
inland
cities
of
massachusetts
she
had
grown
up
and
gone
to
school
there
and
had
never
yet
been
thirty
miles
away
her
father
was
a
busy
lawyer
making
a
handsome
living
for
his
family
and
laying
aside
abundantly
for
their
future
provision
but
giving
himself
no
lengthened
recreations
and
scarcely
thinking
of
them
as
needful
for
the
rest
it
was
a
pleasant
large
brown
wooden
house
they
lived
in
on
the
corner
of
two
streets
with
a
great
green
about
it
on
two
sides
where
chestnut
and
cherry
trees
shaded
it
from
the
public
way
and
brightened
under
the
parlor
windows
and
about
the
porch
just
greenness
and
bloom
enough
to
suggest
always
more
just
sweetness
and
sunshine
and
enough
in
the
early
summer
days
to
whisper
of
broad
fields
and
deep
woods
where
they
rioted
without
stint
and
these
days
always
put
leslie
into
a
certain
happy
impatience
and
set
her
dreaming
and
imagining
and
she
learned
a
great
deal
of
her
geography
in
the
fashion
that
we
have
hinted
at
miss
goldthwaite
was
singularly
discursive
and
fragmentary
in
her
conversation
this
morning
somehow
she
dropped
the
suddenly
and
asked
a
new
question
and
how
comes
on
the
o
cousin
del
i
humiliated
disgusted
i
feel
as
small
as
butterflies
pinfeathers
i
been
to
see
the
haddens
linceford
has
just
got
home
from
paris
and
brought
them
wardrobes
to
last
to
remotest
posterity
and
things
such
rufflings
and
stitchings
and
embroiderings
why
mine
look
as
if
they
been
made
by
the
blacksmith
the
was
an
institution
of
goldthwaite
resultant
partly
from
her
new
england
ideas
of
womanly
industry
and
thrift
born
and
brought
up
as
she
had
been
in
a
family
whose
traditions
were
of
sufficient
for
a
lifetime
spun
and
woven
by
girls
before
their
year
and
whose
inheritance
from
mother
to
daughter
was
invariably
of
heedfully
stored
personal
and
household
plenishings
made
of
pure
material
that
was
worth
the
laying
by
and
carefully
bleached
and
looked
to
year
by
year
partly
also
from
a
certain
theory
of
wisdom
which
she
had
adopted
that
when
girls
were
once
old
enough
to
care
for
and
pride
themselves
on
a
plentiful
outfit
it
was
best
they
should
have
it
as
a
natural
prerogative
of
rather
than
that
the
trousseau
should
come
to
be
as
she
believed
it
so
apt
to
be
one
of
the
inciting
temptations
to
heedless
matrimony
i
have
heard
of
a
mother
whose
passion
was
for
elegant
old
lace
and
who
boasted
to
her
female
friends
that
when
her
little
daughter
was
ten
years
old
she
had
her
with
the
beginning
of
her
hoard
in
costly
contributions
from
the
stores
of
herself
and
of
the
child
maiden
aunts
goldthwaite
did
a
better
and
more
sensible
thing
than
this
when
leslie
was
fifteen
she
presented
her
with
pieces
of
beautiful
linen
and
cotton
and
cambric
and
bade
her
begin
to
make
garments
which
should
be
in
dozens
to
be
laid
by
in
reserve
as
she
completed
them
until
she
had
a
bureau
that
should
defend
her
from
the
necessity
of
what
she
called
a
wretched
living
from
hand
to
mouth
always
having
underclothing
to
make
up
in
the
midst
of
all
else
that
she
would
find
to
do
and
to
learn
leslie
need
not
have
been
ashamed
and
i
do
think
in
her
heart
she
was
of
the
fresh
white
piles
that
had
already
begun
to
make
promise
of
filling
a
drawer
which
she
drew
out
as
she
answered
cousin
delight
question
the
gathers
the
tiny
dots
of
stitches
that
held
them
to
their
delicate
bindings
the
hems
and
tucks
true
to
a
thread
and
dotted
with
the
same
fairy
needle
dimples
no
but
all
real
dainty
the
bits
of
ruffling
peeping
out
from
the
folds
with
their
edges
in
almost
invisible
and
here
and
there
a
finishing
of
lovely
crochet
done
at
odd
minutes
and
for
visiting
work
there
was
something
prettier
and
more
precious
really
in
all
this
than
in
the
imported
fineries
which
had
come
without
labor
and
without
thought
to
her
friends
the
haddens
besides
there
were
the
pleasant
talks
and
readings
of
the
winter
evenings
all
threaded
in
and
out
and
associated
indelibly
with
every
seam
there
was
the
whole
of
david
copperfield
and
the
beginning
of
our
mutual
friend
ruffled
up
into
the
and
some
of
the
crochet
was
beautiful
with
the
rhymed
pathos
of
enoch
arden
and
some
with
the
poetry
of
the
wayside
inn
and
there
were
places
where
stitches
had
had
to
be
picked
out
and
done
over
when
the
eye
grew
dim
and
the
hand
trembled
while
the
great
war
news
was
being
read
leslie
loved
it
and
had
a
pride
in
it
all
it
was
not
truly
and
only
humiliation
and
disgust
at
with
the
haddens
but
some
other
and
unexplained
doubt
which
moved
her
now
and
which
was
stirred
often
by
this
or
any
other
of
the
objects
and
circumstances
of
her
life
and
which
kept
her
standing
there
with
her
hand
upon
the
in
a
sort
of
absence
while
cousin
delight
looked
in
approved
and
presently
dropped
quietly
among
the
rest
like
a
bit
of
money
into
a
the
delicate
breadths
of
linen
cambric
she
had
just
finished
hemstitching
and
rolled
together
oh
thank
you
but
cousin
delight
said
leslie
shutting
the
drawer
and
turning
short
round
suddenly
i
wish
you
just
tell
me
what
you
think
is
the
sense
of
that
about
the
i
suppose
it
awfully
wicked
but
i
never
could
see
is
everything
that
is
out
and
out
fruit
and
is
it
all
to
be
cursed
and
why
there
be
anything
but
leaves
when
time
of
figs
was
not
yet
after
her
first
hesitation
she
spoke
quickly
impetuously
and
without
pause
as
something
that
come
out
i
suppose
that
has
troubled
you
as
i
dare
say
it
has
troubled
a
great
many
other
people
said
cousin
delight
it
used
to
be
a
puzzle
and
a
trouble
to
me
but
now
it
seems
to
me
one
of
the
most
beautiful
things
of
all
she
paused
i
see
how
said
leslie
emphatically
it
always
seems
to
me
so
somehow
unreasonable
and
angry
she
said
this
in
a
lower
tone
as
afraid
of
the
uttered
audacity
of
her
own
thought
and
she
walked
off
as
she
spoke
towards
the
window
once
more
and
stood
with
her
back
to
miss
goldthwaite
almost
as
if
she
wished
to
have
done
again
with
the
topic
it
was
not
easy
for
leslie
to
speak
out
upon
such
things
it
almost
made
her
feel
cross
when
she
had
done
it
people
mistake
the
true
cause
and
effect
i
think
said
delight
goldthwaite
and
so
lose
all
the
wonderful
enforcement
of
that
acted
parable
it
was
not
be
the
because
i
have
found
nothing
thereon
but
grow
on
thee
henceforward
forever
it
seems
to
me
i
can
hear
the
tone
of
tender
solemnity
in
which
jesus
would
say
such
words
knowing
as
only
he
knew
all
that
they
meant
and
what
should
come
inevitably
of
such
a
sentence
presently
the
withered
away
the
life
was
nothing
any
longer
from
the
moment
when
it
might
not
be
what
all
life
is
a
reaching
forward
to
the
perfecting
of
some
fruit
there
was
nothing
to
come
ever
again
of
all
its
greenness
and
beauty
and
the
greenness
and
beauty
which
were
only
a
form
and
a
promise
ceased
to
be
it
was
the
way
he
took
to
show
his
disciples
in
a
manner
they
should
never
forget
the
inexorable
condition
upon
which
all
life
is
given
and
that
the
barren
life
so
soon
as
its
barrenness
is
absolutely
hopeless
becomes
a
literal
death
leslie
stood
still
with
her
back
to
miss
goldthwaite
and
her
face
to
the
window
her
perplexity
was
changed
but
hardly
cleared
there
were
many
things
that
crowded
into
her
thoughts
and
might
have
been
spoken
but
it
was
quite
impossible
for
her
to
speak
impossible
on
this
topic
and
she
certainly
could
not
speak
at
once
on
any
other
many
seconds
of
silence
counted
themselves
between
the
two
then
cousin
delight
feeling
an
intuition
of
much
that
held
and
hindered
the
young
girl
spoke
again
does
this
make
life
seem
hard
yes
said
leslie
then
with
an
effort
that
hoarsened
her
very
voice
frightful
and
as
she
spoke
she
turned
again
quickly
as
if
to
be
motionless
longer
were
to
invite
more
talk
and
went
over
to
the
other
window
where
her
hung
and
began
to
take
down
the
glasses
like
all
parables
it
is
manifold
said
delight
gently
there
is
a
great
hope
in
it
too
leslie
was
at
her
basin
now
turning
the
water
faucet
to
rinse
and
refill
the
little
she
handled
the
things
quietly
but
she
made
no
pause
it
shows
that
while
we
see
the
leaf
we
may
have
hope
of
the
fruit
in
ourselves
or
in
others
she
could
not
see
leslie
face
if
she
had
she
would
have
perceived
a
quick
lifting
and
lightening
upon
it
then
a
questioning
that
would
not
very
long
be
repressed
to
silence
the
glasses
were
put
in
the
cage
again
and
presently
leslie
came
back
to
a
little
low
seat
by
miss
goldthwaite
side
which
she
had
been
occupying
before
all
this
talk
began
other
people
puzzle
me
as
much
as
myself
she
said
i
think
the
whole
world
is
running
to
leaves
sometimes
some
things
flower
almost
invisibly
and
hide
away
their
fruit
under
thick
foliage
it
is
often
only
when
the
winds
shake
their
leaves
down
and
strip
the
branches
bare
that
we
find
the
best
that
has
been
growing
they
make
a
great
fuss
and
flourish
with
the
leaves
though
as
long
as
they
can
and
it
who
shall
grow
the
broadest
and
tallest
and
flaunt
out
with
the
most
of
them
after
all
it
natural
and
they
beautiful
in
themselves
and
there
a
for
leaves
too
before
the
figs
exactly
we
have
a
right
to
look
for
the
leaves
and
to
be
glad
of
them
that
is
a
part
of
the
parable
cousin
delight
let
talk
of
real
things
and
let
the
parable
alone
a
minute
leslie
sprang
impulsively
to
her
bureau
again
and
flung
forth
the
linen
drawer
there
are
my
some
of
them
and
here
are
more
she
turned
with
a
quick
movement
to
her
wardrobe
pulled
out
and
uncovered
a
which
held
a
dainty
headgear
of
the
new
spring
fashion
and
then
took
down
from
a
hook
and
tossed
upon
it
a
silken
garment
that
fluttered
with
fresh
ribbons
how
much
of
this
outside
business
is
right
and
how
much
wrong
i
should
be
glad
to
know
it
all
takes
time
and
thoughts
and
those
are
life
how
much
life
must
go
into
the
leaves
that
what
puzzles
me
i
ca
do
without
the
things
and
i
ca
be
let
to
take
comfort
in
them
as
grandma
says
either
she
was
on
the
floor
now
beside
her
little
fineries
her
hands
clasped
together
about
one
knee
and
her
face
turned
up
to
cousin
delight
she
looked
as
if
she
half
believed
herself
to
be
and
clothes
are
but
the
first
want
the
primitive
the
world
is
full
of
other
outside
business
as
much
outside
as
these
pursued
miss
goldthwaite
thoughtfully
everything
is
outside
said
leslie
learning
and
behaving
and
going
and
doing
and
seeing
and
hearing
and
having
all
a
muddle
as
the
poor
man
says
in
times
i
do
think
i
can
do
without
the
parable
said
cousin
delight
the
real
inward
principle
of
the
tree
that
which
corresponds
to
thought
and
purpose
in
the
soul
urges
always
to
the
finishing
of
its
life
in
the
fruit
the
leaves
are
only
by
the
way
an
outgrowth
of
the
same
vitality
and
a
process
toward
the
end
but
never
in
any
living
thing
the
end
itself
um
said
leslie
in
her
nonchalant
fashion
again
her
chin
between
her
two
hands
now
and
her
head
making
little
appreciative
nods
like
condensed
milk
a
great
deal
in
a
little
of
it
i
put
the
away
now
and
think
it
over
but
as
she
sprang
up
and
came
round
behind
miss
goldthwaite
chair
she
stopped
and
gave
her
a
little
kiss
on
the
top
of
her
head
if
cousin
delight
had
seen
there
was
a
bright
softness
in
the
eyes
which
told
of
feeling
and
of
gladness
that
welcomed
the
quick
touch
of
truth
miss
goldthwaite
knew
one
good
thing
when
she
had
driven
her
nail
she
never
hammered
in
the
head
with
a
punch
like
a
carpenter
leslie
said
of
her
she
believed
that
in
moral
that
finishing
implement
belonged
properly
to
the
hand
of
an
chapter
ii
wayside
glimpses
i
have
mentioned
one
little
theory
relating
solely
to
domestic
thrift
which
guided
goldthwaite
in
her
arrangements
for
her
daughter
i
believe
that
with
this
exception
she
brought
up
her
family
very
nearly
without
any
theory
whatever
she
did
it
very
much
on
the
system
she
took
for
granted
that
her
children
were
born
with
the
same
natural
perceptions
as
herself
that
they
could
recognize
little
by
little
as
they
grew
into
it
the
principles
of
the
moral
world
reason
right
propriety
as
they
recognized
growing
into
them
the
conditions
of
their
outward
living
she
made
her
own
life
a
consistent
recognition
of
these
and
she
lived
before
them
there
was
never
any
course
pursued
with
sole
calculation
as
to
its
effect
on
the
children
family
discussion
and
deliberation
was
seldom
with
closed
doors
questions
that
came
up
were
considered
as
they
came
and
the
young
members
of
the
household
perceived
as
soon
as
their
elders
the
reasons
why
of
most
decisions
they
were
part
and
parcel
of
the
whole
régime
they
learned
politeness
by
being
as
politely
attended
to
as
company
they
learned
to
be
reasonable
by
seeing
how
the
compelled
father
and
mother
and
not
by
having
their
vision
stopped
short
at
the
arbitrary
fact
that
father
and
mother
compelled
them
i
think
on
the
whole
the
goldthwaite
turned
out
as
good
a
method
as
any
men
have
found
out
lately
that
even
horses
may
be
guided
without
reins
it
was
characteristic
therefore
that
goldthwaite
receiving
one
day
a
confidential
note
proposing
to
her
a
pleasant
plan
in
behalf
of
leslie
and
intended
to
guard
against
a
premature
delight
and
eagerness
and
so
perhaps
an
ultimate
disappointment
for
that
young
lady
should
instantly
on
reading
it
lay
it
open
upon
the
table
before
her
daughter
from
linceford
she
said
and
concerning
you
leslie
took
it
up
expecting
possibly
an
invitation
to
tea
when
she
saw
what
it
really
was
her
dark
eyes
almost
blazed
with
sudden
joyous
excitement
of
course
i
should
be
delighted
to
say
yes
for
you
said
goldthwaite
but
there
are
things
to
be
considered
i
ca
tell
how
it
will
strike
your
father
school
suggested
leslie
the
light
in
her
eyes
quieting
a
little
yes
and
expense
though
i
do
think
he
would
refuse
on
that
score
i
should
have
goldthwaite
tone
was
only
half
and
very
gently
objecting
there
was
an
inflection
of
ready
in
it
also
to
have
had
your
journey
with
me
but
you
might
have
waited
a
long
time
for
that
if
leslie
were
disappointed
in
the
end
she
would
have
known
that
her
mother
heart
had
been
with
her
from
the
beginning
and
grown
people
seldom
realize
how
this
helps
even
the
merest
child
to
bear
a
denial
there
is
only
a
month
now
to
vacation
said
the
young
girl
what
do
you
think
waylie
would
say
i
really
think
answered
leslie
after
a
pause
that
he
would
say
it
was
better
than
books
they
sat
at
their
sewing
together
after
this
without
speaking
very
much
more
at
the
present
time
about
it
goldthwaite
was
thinking
it
over
in
her
motherly
mind
and
in
the
mind
of
leslie
thought
and
hope
and
anticipation
were
dancing
a
reel
with
each
other
it
is
time
to
tell
the
reader
of
the
what
and
why
linceford
the
elder
married
daughter
of
the
hadden
family
many
years
the
elder
of
her
sisters
jeannie
and
elinor
was
about
to
take
them
under
her
care
to
the
mountains
for
the
summer
and
she
kindly
proposed
joining
leslie
goldthwaite
to
her
charge
the
mountains
in
new
england
means
usually
in
common
speech
the
one
royal
range
of
the
white
hills
you
can
think
what
this
opportunity
was
to
a
young
girl
full
of
fancy
loving
to
hunt
out
even
by
map
and
gazetteer
the
of
travel
and
wondering
already
if
she
should
ever
really
journey
otherwise
you
can
think
how
she
waited
trying
to
believe
she
could
bear
any
decision
for
the
final
determination
concerning
her
if
it
had
been
to
newport
or
saratoga
i
should
have
said
no
at
once
said
goldthwaite
linceford
is
a
gay
extravagant
woman
and
the
haddens
ideas
do
precisely
suit
mine
but
the
mountains
she
ca
get
into
much
harm
there
i
should
have
cared
for
newport
or
the
springs
father
truly
said
leslie
with
a
little
hopeful
flutter
of
eagerness
in
her
voice
but
the
real
mountains
o
father
the
o
father
was
not
without
its
weight
also
waylie
whom
goldthwaite
called
on
and
consulted
threw
his
opinion
into
the
favoring
scale
precisely
as
leslie
had
foreseen
he
was
a
teacher
who
did
not
imagine
all
possible
educational
advantage
to
be
shut
up
within
the
four
walls
of
his
or
any
other
schoolroom
she
is
just
the
girl
to
whom
it
will
do
great
good
he
said
leslie
last
week
lessons
were
not
accomplished
the
less
satisfactorily
for
this
word
of
his
and
the
pleasure
it
opened
to
her
there
came
a
few
busy
days
of
stitching
and
starching
and
crimping
and
packing
and
then
in
the
last
of
june
they
would
be
off
they
were
to
go
on
monday
the
haddens
came
over
on
saturday
afternoon
just
as
leslie
had
nearly
put
the
last
things
into
her
trunk
a
new
trunk
quite
her
own
with
her
initials
in
black
paint
upon
the
russet
leather
at
each
end
on
the
bed
lay
her
pretty
balmoral
suit
made
purposely
for
mountain
wears
and
just
finished
the
young
girls
got
together
here
in
leslie
chamber
of
course
oh
how
pretty
it
perfectly
charming
the
loveliest
balmoral
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
cried
jeannie
hadden
seizing
upon
it
instantly
as
she
entered
the
room
why
you
look
like
a
hamadryad
all
in
these
wood
browns
it
was
an
uncommonly
pretty
striped
petticoat
in
two
alternating
shades
of
dark
and
golden
brown
with
just
a
of
black
defining
their
edges
and
the
border
was
one
broad
soft
velvety
band
of
black
and
a
narrower
one
following
it
above
and
below
easing
the
contrast
and
blending
the
colors
the
jacket
or
rather
shirt
finished
at
the
waist
with
a
bit
of
a
polka
frill
was
a
soft
flannel
of
the
bright
brown
shade
braided
with
the
darker
hue
and
with
black
and
two
pairs
of
bright
brown
stockings
marked
transversely
with
mere
of
black
completed
the
mountain
outfit
yes
all
i
want
is
said
leslie
stopping
short
as
she
took
up
the
hat
that
lay
there
also
last
summer
hat
a
plain
black
straw
with
a
slight
brim
and
ornamented
only
with
a
round
lace
veil
and
two
bits
of
ostrich
feather
but
never
mind
it
do
well
enough
as
she
laid
it
down
again
and
ceased
speaking
cousin
delight
came
in
straight
from
boston
where
she
had
been
doing
two
days
shopping
and
in
her
hand
she
carried
a
parcel
in
white
paper
i
was
going
to
say
a
round
parcel
which
it
would
have
been
but
for
something
which
ran
out
in
a
sharp
tangent
from
one
side
and
pushed
the
wrappings
into
an
odd
angle
this
she
put
into
leslie
hands
a
fresh
for
you
my
dear
what
she
mean
cried
the
haddens
coming
close
to
see
only
a
little
paradise
fashion
of
speech
between
cousin
del
and
me
said
leslie
coloring
a
little
and
laughing
while
she
began
somewhat
hurriedly
to
remove
the
wrappings
what
have
you
done
and
how
did
you
come
to
think
she
exclaimed
as
the
thing
inclosed
appeared
a
round
brown
straw
turban
not
a
staring
turban
but
one
of
those
that
slope
with
a
little
graceful
downward
droop
upon
the
brow
bound
with
a
pheasant
breast
the
wing
shooting
out
jauntily
in
the
tangent
i
mentioned
over
the
right
ear
all
in
bright
browns
in
lovely
harmony
with
the
rest
of
the
hamadryad
costume
it
no
use
to
begin
to
thank
you
cousin
del
it
just
one
of
the
things
you
re
always
doing
and
rejoice
in
doing
the
happy
face
was
full
of
loving
thanks
plainer
than
many
words
only
you
a
kind
of
a
yourself
after
all
i
afraid
with
your
beguilements
i
wonder
if
you
thought
of
that
whispered
leslie
merrily
while
the
others
over
the
gift
what
else
do
you
think
i
shall
be
good
for
when
i
get
all
those
on
i
venture
you
said
cousin
delight
and
the
trifling
words
conveyed
a
real
earnest
confidence
the
best
possible
antidote
to
the
beguilement
one
thing
is
funny
said
jeannie
hadden
suddenly
with
an
accent
of
demur
we
all
pheasants
new
hats
are
pheasants
too
i
know
what
augusta
will
think
of
such
a
covey
of
us
oh
it
no
matter
said
elinor
this
is
a
golden
pheasant
on
brown
straw
and
ours
are
purple
on
black
besides
we
all
different
enough
i
suppose
it
does
signify
returned
jeannie
and
if
augusta
thinks
it
does
she
may
just
give
me
that
black
and
white
plover
of
hers
i
wanted
so
i
think
our
complexions
all
pretty
well
suited
this
was
true
the
fair
hair
and
deep
blue
eyes
of
elinor
were
as
pretty
under
the
purple
plumage
as
jeannie
darker
locks
and
brilliant
bloom
and
there
was
a
wonderful
bright
mingling
of
color
between
the
golden
pheasant
breast
and
the
gleaming
chestnut
waves
it
crowned
as
leslie
took
her
hat
and
tried
it
on
this
was
one
of
the
little
touches
of
perfect
taste
and
adaptation
which
could
sometimes
make
leslie
goldthwaite
almost
beautiful
and
was
there
ever
a
girl
of
fifteen
who
would
not
like
to
be
beautiful
if
she
could
this
wish
and
the
thought
and
effort
it
would
induce
were
likely
to
be
her
great
temptation
passably
pretty
girls
who
may
with
care
make
themselves
often
more
than
passable
have
far
the
hardest
of
it
with
their
consciences
about
these
things
and
leslie
had
a
conscience
and
was
reflective
for
her
age
and
we
have
seen
how
questions
had
begun
to
trouble
her
a
sunday
between
a
packing
and
a
journey
is
a
trying
day
always
there
are
the
trunks
and
it
is
impossible
not
to
think
of
the
getting
up
and
getting
off
and
one
hates
so
to
take
out
fresh
sleeves
and
collars
and
and
to
wear
one
nice
white
skirts
it
is
a
sunday
put
off
too
probably
with
but
odds
and
ends
of
thought
as
well
as
apparel
leslie
went
to
church
of
course
the
goldthwaites
were
always
regular
in
this
and
she
wore
her
quiet
straw
bonnet
goldthwaite
had
a
feeling
that
hats
were
rather
pert
and
coquettish
for
the
sanctuary
nevertheless
they
met
the
haddens
in
the
porch
in
the
glory
of
their
purple
pheasant
plumes
whereof
the
long
made
great
circles
in
the
air
as
the
young
heads
turned
this
way
and
that
in
the
excitement
of
a
few
snatched
words
before
they
entered
the
organ
was
playing
and
the
low
deep
tremulous
rumble
that
an
organ
gives
sometimes
when
it
seems
to
creep
under
and
vibrate
all
things
with
a
strange
vital
thrill
overswept
their
trivial
chat
and
made
leslie
almost
shiver
oh
i
wish
they
would
do
that
she
said
turning
to
go
in
what
said
jeannie
hadden
unaware
touch
the
nerve
the
great
nerve
of
creation
what
queer
things
les
goldthwaite
says
sometimes
whispered
elinor
and
they
passed
the
inner
door
the
goldthwaites
sat
two
pews
behind
the
haddens
leslie
could
not
help
thinking
how
elegant
linceford
was
as
she
swept
in
in
her
rich
black
silk
and
real
lace
shawl
and
delicate
costly
bonnet
and
the
perfectly
gloved
hand
that
upheld
a
bit
of
extravagance
in
valenciennes
lace
and
cambric
made
devotion
seem
what
the
more
graceful
and
touching
in
one
who
had
all
this
world
luxuries
or
almost
a
mockery
the
hats
went
decorously
down
in
but
the
ran
up
perker
than
ever
from
the
posture
leslie
saw
this
because
she
had
lifted
her
own
head
and
unclosed
her
eyes
in
a
honesty
when
she
found
on
what
her
secret
thoughts
were
running
were
other
people
so
much
better
than
she
and
they
do
both
things
how
much
was
right
in
all
this
that
was
outwardly
so
beguiling
and
where
did
the
serving
mammon
begin
was
everything
so
much
intenser
and
more
absorbing
with
her
than
with
the
haddens
why
could
she
not
take
things
as
they
came
as
these
girls
did
or
seemed
to
do
be
glad
of
her
pretty
things
her
pretty
looks
even
her
coming
pleasures
with
no
misgivings
or
and
then
turn
round
and
say
her
prayers
properly
was
beauty
put
into
the
world
for
the
sake
of
beauty
and
was
it
right
to
love
it
and
make
much
of
it
and
multiply
it
what
were
arts
and
human
ingenuities
for
and
the
things
given
to
work
with
all
this
grave
weighing
of
a
great
moral
question
was
in
the
mind
of
the
young
girl
of
fifteen
again
this
sunday
morning
such
doubts
and
balancings
begin
far
earlier
often
than
we
are
apt
to
think
the
minister
shook
hands
cordially
and
respectfully
with
linceford
after
church
he
had
no
hesitation
at
her
stylishness
and
fineries
everybody
took
everybody
else
for
granted
and
it
was
all
right
leslie
goldthwaite
supposed
except
in
her
own
foolish
unregulated
thoughts
everybody
else
had
done
their
sunday
duty
and
it
was
enough
only
she
had
been
all
wrong
and
astray
and
in
confusion
there
was
a
time
for
everything
only
her
times
and
thoughts
would
mix
themselves
up
and
interfere
perhaps
she
was
very
and
the
only
way
for
her
would
be
to
give
it
all
up
and
wear
drab
or
whatever
else
might
be
most
unbecoming
and
be
fiercely
severe
mortifying
the
flesh
she
got
over
that
her
young
nature
reacting
as
they
all
walked
up
the
street
together
while
the
sun
shone
down
smilingly
upon
the
world
in
sunday
best
and
the
flowers
were
gay
in
the
and
miss
shop
was
reverential
with
the
green
shutters
before
the
windows
that
had
been
gorgeous
yesterday
with
bright
ribbons
and
fresh
fashions
and
there
was
something
thankful
in
her
feeling
of
the
pleasantness
that
was
about
her
and
a
certainty
that
she
should
only
grow
morose
if
she
took
to
resisting
it
all
she
would
be
as
good
as
she
could
and
let
the
pleasantness
and
the
prettiness
come
by
the
way
yes
that
was
just
what
cousin
delight
had
said
all
these
things
shall
be
added
was
not
that
the
gospel
word
so
her
troubling
thought
was
laid
for
the
hour
but
it
should
come
up
again
it
was
in
the
seeking
first
that
the
question
lay
by
and
by
she
would
go
back
of
the
other
to
this
and
see
clearer
in
the
light
perhaps
of
something
that
had
been
already
given
her
and
which
as
she
lived
on
toward
a
fuller
readiness
for
it
should
be
brought
to
her
remembrance
monday
brought
the
perfection
of
a
traveler
morning
there
had
been
a
shower
during
the
night
and
the
highways
lay
cool
moist
and
dark
brown
between
the
green
of
the
fields
and
the
pavements
of
the
town
there
would
be
no
dust
even
on
the
railroad
and
the
air
was
an
impalpable
draught
of
delight
to
the
three
young
girls
standing
there
under
the
station
portico
for
they
chose
the
smell
of
the
morning
rather
than
the
odors
of
apples
and
cakes
and
indescribables
which
go
to
make
up
the
distinctive
atmosphere
of
a
railway
there
was
but
one
thing
to
be
done
in
the
world
one
thing
for
which
the
sun
rose
and
wheeled
himself
toward
that
point
in
the
heavens
which
would
make
eight
down
below
of
all
the
ships
that
might
sail
this
day
out
of
harbors
or
the
trains
that
might
steam
out
of
cities
across
states
they
recked
nothing
but
of
this
that
was
to
take
them
toward
the
hills
there
were
unfortunates
doubtless
bound
elsewhere
by
peremptory
necessity
there
were
people
who
were
going
nowhere
but
about
their
daily
work
and
errands
all
these
were
simply
to
be
pitied
or
wondered
at
as
to
how
they
could
feel
to
be
going
upon
a
mountain
journey
it
is
queer
to
think
on
a
last
thursday
in
november
or
on
a
fourth
of
july
of
states
where
there
may
not
be
a
thanksgiving
or
of
lands
that
have
no
independence
day
it
was
just
as
strange
somehow
to
imagine
how
this
day
that
was
to
them
the
culminating
point
of
so
much
happy
anticipation
the
beginning
of
so
much
certain
joy
could
be
otherwise
and
yet
be
anything
to
the
supernumerary
people
who
filled
up
around
them
the
life
that
centred
in
just
this
to
them
yet
in
truth
it
was
to
most
folks
simply
a
fair
monday
morning
and
an
excellent
drying
day
they
bounded
off
along
the
iron
track
the
great
steam
pulse
throbbed
no
faster
than
in
time
to
their
bright
young
eagerness
it
had
been
a
momentous
matter
to
decide
upon
their
seats
of
which
there
had
been
opportunity
for
choice
when
they
entered
the
car
at
last
they
had
been
happily
settled
face
to
face
by
the
removal
of
a
couple
of
young
farmers
who
saw
that
the
four
ladies
wished
to
be
seated
together
their
were
hung
up
their
rolls
of
shawls
disposed
beneath
their
feet
and
linceford
had
taken
out
her
novel
the
haddens
had
each
a
book
also
in
her
bag
to
be
perfectly
according
to
rule
in
their
equipment
but
they
were
not
old
travelers
enough
to
care
to
begin
upon
them
yet
as
to
leslie
goldthwaite
book
lay
ready
open
before
her
for
long
contented
reading
in
two
chapters
both
visible
at
once
the
broad
open
country
with
its
shifting
pictures
and
suggestions
of
life
and
pleasantness
and
the
carriage
interior
with
its
dissimilar
human
freight
and
its
yet
more
varied
hints
of
history
and
character
and
purpose
she
made
a
story
in
her
own
mind
half
unconsciously
of
every
one
about
her
of
the
pretty
girl
alone
with
no
elaborate
traveling
arrangements
going
only
it
was
evident
from
one
to
another
perhaps
to
spend
a
summer
day
with
a
friend
of
the
stout
old
country
grandmamma
with
a
basket
full
of
doughnuts
and
early
apples
that
made
a
spiciness
and
orchard
fragrance
all
about
her
and
that
she
surely
never
meant
to
eat
herself
seeing
first
that
she
had
not
a
tooth
in
her
head
and
also
that
she
made
repeated
anxious
requests
of
the
conductor
catching
him
by
the
as
he
passed
to
let
her
know
in
season
when
they
began
to
get
into
bartley
who
asked
confidentially
of
her
next
neighbor
a
elderly
gentleman
if
he
did
think
it
was
about
as
cheap
comin
by
the
cars
as
it
would
ha
ben
to
hire
a
passage
any
other
way
and
innocently
endured
the
smile
that
her
query
called
forth
on
half
a
dozen
faces
about
her
the
gentleman
a
smile
courteously
lowered
his
newspaper
to
reply
that
he
always
thought
it
better
to
avail
one
self
of
established
conveniences
rather
than
to
waste
time
in
independent
contrivances
and
the
old
lady
sat
back
as
far
back
as
she
dared
considering
her
momentary
apprehension
of
bartley
quite
happily
complacent
in
the
confirmation
of
her
own
wisdom
there
was
a
trig
not
to
say
prim
spinster
without
a
vestige
of
comeliness
in
her
face
save
the
comeliness
of
a
clear
clean
energetic
expression
such
as
a
new
broom
or
a
bright
might
have
suggesting
capacity
for
house
thrift
and
hearth
comfort
who
wore
a
gray
straw
bonnet
clean
and
neat
as
if
it
had
not
lasted
for
six
years
at
least
which
its
fashion
evidenced
and
which
having
a
bright
green
tuft
of
artificial
grass
stuck
arbitrarily
upon
its
brim
by
way
of
modern
adornment
put
leslie
mischievously
in
mind
of
a
roof
so
old
that
blades
had
sprouted
in
the
eaves
she
was
glad
afterwards
that
she
had
not
spoken
her
mischief
what
made
life
beautiful
to
all
these
people
these
farmers
who
put
on
at
daybreak
their
coarse
homespun
for
long
hours
of
rough
labor
these
homely
women
who
knew
nothing
of
graceful
fashions
who
had
always
too
much
to
do
to
think
of
elegance
in
doing
perhaps
that
was
just
it
they
had
always
something
to
do
something
outside
of
themselves
in
their
honest
earnest
lives
there
was
little
to
tempt
them
to
a
frivolous
leslie
touched
close
upon
the
very
help
and
solution
she
wanted
as
she
thought
these
thoughts
opposite
to
her
there
sat
a
poor
man
to
whom
there
had
happened
a
great
misfortune
one
eye
was
lost
and
the
cheek
was
drawn
and
marked
by
some
great
scar
of
wound
or
burn
one
half
his
face
was
a
fearful
blot
how
did
people
bear
such
things
as
these
to
go
through
the
world
knowing
that
it
could
never
be
pleasant
to
any
human
being
to
look
upon
them
that
an
instinct
of
pity
and
courtesy
would
even
turn
every
casual
glance
away
there
was
a
strange
sorrowful
pleading
in
the
one
expressive
side
of
the
man
countenance
and
a
singularly
untoward
incident
presently
called
it
forth
and
made
it
almost
ludicrously
pitiful
a
bustling
fellow
entered
at
a
his
arms
full
of
a
great
frame
that
he
carried
as
he
blundered
along
the
passage
looking
for
a
seat
a
jolt
of
the
car
in
starting
pitched
him
suddenly
into
the
vacant
place
beside
this
man
and
the
open
expanse
of
the
large
for
it
was
that
which
the
frame
held
was
fairly
smitten
like
an
insult
of
fate
into
the
very
face
of
the
unfortunate
beg
pardon
the
new
comer
said
in
an
way
as
he
settled
himself
holding
the
glass
full
before
the
other
while
he
righted
it
and
then
for
the
first
time
giving
a
quick
glance
toward
him
the
astonishment
the
intuitive
repulsion
the
consciousness
of
what
he
had
done
betokened
by
the
instant
look
of
the
one
man
and
the
helpless
mute
how
could
you
that
seemed
spoken
in
the
strange
uprolled
expression
of
the
other
these
regards
made
a
brief
concurrence
at
once
sad
and
irresistibly
funny
as
so
many
things
in
this
strange
life
are
the
man
of
the
mirror
inclined
his
burden
quietly
the
other
way
and
now
it
reflected
the
bright
faces
opposite
under
the
pheasant
plumes
was
it
any
delight
to
leslie
to
see
her
own
face
so
what
was
the
use
of
being
what
right
had
she
to
wish
to
be
pretty
and
pleasant
to
look
at
when
there
were
such
utter
lifelong
loss
and
disfigurement
in
the
world
for
others
why
should
it
not
as
well
happen
to
her
and
how
did
the
world
seem
to
such
a
person
and
where
was
the
of
it
this
was
the
question
which
lingered
last
in
her
mind
and
to
which
all
else
reverted
be
able
to
perhaps
this
was
it
and
this
was
greater
indeed
than
any
outer
grace
such
as
these
were
the
wayside
meanings
that
came
to
leslie
goldthwaite
that
morning
in
the
first
few
hours
of
her
journey
meanwhile
jeannie
and
elinor
hadden
had
begun
to
be
tired
and
linceford
not
much
entertained
with
her
novel
held
it
half
closed
over
her
finger
drew
her
brown
veil
closely
and
sat
with
her
eyes
shut
compensating
herself
with
a
doze
for
her
early
rising
had
the
same
things
come
to
these
not
precisely
something
else
perhaps
in
all
things
one
is
still
taken
and
another
left
i
can
only
follow
minutely
one
chapter
iii
eyestones
the
road
left
the
flat
farming
country
now
and
turned
northward
up
the
beautiful
river
valley
there
was
plenty
to
enjoy
outside
and
it
was
growing
more
and
more
lovely
with
almost
every
mile
they
left
the
great
towns
gradually
behind
each
succeeding
one
seemed
more
simply
rural
young
girls
were
gathered
on
the
platforms
at
the
little
stations
where
they
stopped
sometimes
it
was
the
grand
excitement
of
the
place
the
coming
of
the
train
and
to
these
village
lasses
was
what
the
piazzas
or
the
springs
are
to
gay
dwellers
at
saratoga
by
they
steamed
up
to
the
stately
back
staircase
of
the
pemigewasset
in
the
little
parlor
where
they
smoothed
their
hair
and
rested
a
moment
before
going
to
the
they
met
again
the
lady
of
the
bonnet
she
took
this
off
making
herself
comfortable
in
her
primitive
fashion
for
dinner
and
then
leslie
noticed
how
little
it
was
from
any
poverty
of
nature
that
the
fair
and
abundant
hair
at
least
had
not
been
made
use
of
to
take
down
the
severe
primness
of
her
outward
style
it
did
take
it
down
in
spite
of
all
the
moment
the
gray
straw
was
removed
the
great
round
coil
behind
was
all
real
and
though
it
was
wound
about
with
no
thought
save
of
security
and
fastened
with
a
comb
hair
was
a
matter
of
course
the
thing
was
to
keep
it
out
of
the
way
that
was
what
the
fashion
of
this
head
expressed
and
nothing
more
where
it
was
tucked
over
the
small
ears
and
native
refinement
or
the
other
thing
shows
very
plainly
in
the
ears
it
lay
full
and
shaped
into
a
soft
curve
she
was
only
plain
not
ugly
after
all
and
they
are
very
different
things
there
being
a
beauty
of
plainness
in
men
and
women
as
there
is
in
a
rich
fabric
sometimes
while
leslie
was
noticing
these
things
elinor
hadden
stood
by
a
window
with
her
back
to
the
others
she
did
not
complain
at
first
one
like
to
allow
at
once
that
the
toothache
or
a
mischance
like
this
that
had
happened
to
her
is
an
established
fact
one
is
in
for
it
the
moment
one
does
that
but
she
had
got
a
cinder
in
her
eye
and
though
she
had
winked
and
stared
and
rolled
her
eyelid
under
and
tried
all
the
approved
and
instinctive
means
it
seemed
persistent
and
she
was
forced
at
last
just
as
her
party
was
going
in
to
dinner
to
acknowledge
that
this
traveler
misery
had
befallen
her
and
to
make
up
her
mind
to
the
pain
and
wretchedness
and
ugliness
of
it
for
hours
if
not
even
for
days
her
face
was
quite
disfigured
already
the
afflicted
eye
was
bloodshot
and
the
whole
cheek
was
red
with
tears
and
rubbing
she
could
only
follow
blindly
along
her
handkerchief
up
and
half
groping
into
the
seat
offered
her
begin
comfortlessly
to
help
herself
to
some
soup
with
her
left
hand
there
was
leaning
across
to
inquire
and
pity
there
were
half
a
dozen
things
suggested
to
which
she
could
only
reply
forlornly
and
impatiently
i
tried
it
none
of
them
could
eat
much
or
with
any
satisfaction
this
atom
in
the
wrong
place
set
everything
wrong
all
at
once
with
four
people
who
till
now
had
been
so
cheery
the
spinster
lady
was
seated
at
some
little
distance
down
on
the
opposite
side
she
began
to
send
quick
interested
glances
over
at
them
to
make
little
toward
them
as
if
she
would
speak
and
at
last
leaving
her
own
dinner
unfinished
she
suddenly
pushed
back
her
chair
got
up
and
came
round
she
touched
elinor
hadden
on
the
shoulder
without
the
least
ado
of
ceremony
come
out
here
with
me
she
said
i
can
set
you
right
in
half
a
minute
and
confident
of
being
followed
moved
off
briskly
out
of
the
long
hall
elinor
gave
a
questioning
glance
at
her
sisters
before
she
complied
reminding
leslie
comically
of
the
poor
man
in
the
cars
and
presently
with
a
little
hesitation
linceford
and
jeannie
compromised
the
matter
by
rising
themselves
and
accompanying
elinor
from
the
room
leslie
of
course
went
also
the
lady
had
her
gray
bonnet
on
when
they
got
back
to
the
little
parlor
there
is
no
time
to
lose
in
mere
waiting
for
anything
at
a
railway
and
she
had
her
bag
a
veritable
carpet
thing
open
on
a
chair
before
her
and
in
her
hand
a
long
knit
purse
with
steel
beads
and
rings
out
of
this
she
took
a
twisted
bit
of
paper
and
from
the
paper
a
minute
something
which
she
popped
between
her
lips
as
she
replaced
the
other
things
then
she
just
beckoned
hastily
to
elinor
it
only
an
eyestone
did
you
ever
have
one
in
well
you
need
be
afraid
of
it
i
had
in
hundreds
of
times
you
would
know
was
there
and
it
just
ease
all
the
worry
and
by
and
by
it
drop
out
of
itself
cinder
and
all
they
terribly
teasing
things
cinders
and
somebody
always
sure
to
get
one
i
always
keep
three
eyestones
in
my
purse
you
need
mind
my
not
having
it
back
i
got
a
little
glass
bottle
full
at
home
and
it
wonderful
the
sight
of
comfort
they
been
to
folks
elinor
shrunk
linceford
showed
a
little
demur
about
accepting
the
offered
aid
of
their
unknown
traveling
companion
but
the
good
woman
comprehended
nothing
of
this
and
went
on
insisting
you
better
let
me
put
it
in
right
off
it
only
just
to
drop
it
under
the
eyelid
and
it
work
round
till
it
finds
the
speck
but
you
can
take
it
and
put
it
in
yourself
when
you
made
up
your
mind
if
you
rather
with
which
she
darted
her
head
quickly
from
side
to
side
looking
about
the
room
and
spying
a
scrap
of
paper
on
a
table
had
the
eyestone
twisted
in
it
in
an
instant
and
pressed
it
into
elinor
hand
you
be
glad
enough
of
it
yet
said
she
and
then
took
up
her
bag
and
moved
quickly
off
among
the
other
passengers
descending
to
the
train
what
a
funny
woman
to
be
always
carrying
eyestones
about
and
putting
them
in
people
eyes
said
jeannie
it
was
quite
kind
of
her
i
sure
said
linceford
with
a
mingling
in
her
tone
of
acknowledgment
and
of
polite
tolerance
for
a
great
liberty
when
elegant
people
break
their
necks
or
their
limbs
common
ones
may
approach
and
assist
as
when
a
house
takes
fire
persons
get
in
who
never
did
before
and
perhaps
a
suffering
eye
may
come
into
the
catalogue
of
misfortunes
sufficient
to
equalize
differences
for
the
time
being
but
it
queer
for
a
woman
to
make
free
to
go
without
her
own
dinner
to
offer
help
to
a
stranger
in
pain
not
many
people
in
any
sense
of
the
word
go
about
provided
with
eyestones
against
the
chance
cinders
that
may
worry
others
something
in
this
touched
leslie
goldthwaite
with
a
curious
sense
of
a
beauty
in
living
that
was
not
external
if
it
had
not
been
for
elinor
mishap
and
inability
to
enjoy
it
would
have
been
pure
delight
from
the
very
beginning
this
afternoon
ride
they
had
their
seats
upon
the
mountain
side
where
the
view
of
the
thronging
hills
was
like
an
panorama
as
winding
their
way
farther
and
farther
up
into
the
heart
of
the
wild
and
beautiful
region
the
horizon
seemed
continually
to
fill
with
always
vaster
shapes
that
lifted
themselves
or
emerged
over
and
from
behind
each
other
like
mustering
clans
of
giants
bestirred
and
curious
because
of
the
invasion
among
their
fastnesses
of
this
sprite
of
steam
where
you
can
come
down
i
can
go
up
it
seemed
to
fizz
in
its
strong
exulting
whisper
to
the
river
passing
it
always
yet
never
getting
by
tracking
step
by
step
the
great
stream
backward
toward
its
small
beginnings
see
there
are
real
blue
peaks
cried
leslie
joyously
pointing
away
to
the
north
and
east
where
the
outlines
lay
faint
and
lovely
in
the
far
distance
oh
i
wish
i
could
see
i
losing
it
all
said
elinor
plaintively
and
blindfold
why
do
you
try
the
eyestone
said
jeannie
but
elinor
shrunk
even
yet
from
deliberately
putting
that
great
thing
in
her
eye
agonized
already
by
the
presence
of
a
mote
there
came
a
touch
on
her
shoulder
as
before
the
good
woman
of
the
gray
bonnet
had
come
forward
from
her
seat
farther
down
the
car
i
going
to
stop
presently
she
said
at
east
haverhill
and
i
feel
more
satisfied
in
my
mind
if
you
just
let
me
see
you
easy
before
i
go
besides
if
you
do
do
something
quick
the
cinder
will
get
so
bedded
in
and
make
such
an
inflammation
that
a
dozen
eyestones
would
draw
it
out
at
this
terror
poor
elinor
yielded
in
a
negative
sort
of
way
she
ceased
to
make
resistance
when
her
unknown
friend
taking
the
little
twist
of
paper
from
the
hand
still
fast
closed
over
it
with
the
grasp
of
pain
dexterously
unrolled
it
and
produced
the
wonderful
chalky
morsel
now
see
says
the
blind
man
and
she
drew
down
hand
and
handkerchief
with
determined
yet
gentle
touch
wet
it
in
your
own
mouth
and
the
eyestone
was
between
elinor
lips
before
she
could
refuse
or
be
aware
then
one
thumb
and
finger
was
held
to
take
it
again
while
the
other
made
a
sudden
pinch
at
the
lower
eyelid
and
drawing
it
at
the
outer
corner
before
it
could
so
much
as
quiver
away
again
the
little
white
stone
was
slid
safely
under
now
as
much
as
you
please
as
the
man
said
that
took
an
daguerreotype
of
me
once
here
where
i
get
out
and
there
they
all
are
to
meet
me
and
then
the
cars
stopping
she
made
her
way
with
her
and
parasol
and
a
great
newspaper
bundle
gathered
up
hurriedly
from
goodness
knows
where
along
the
passage
and
out
upon
the
platform
why
it
the
strangest
thing
i
do
feel
it
in
the
least
do
you
suppose
it
ever
come
out
again
augusta
cried
elinor
in
a
tone
greatly
altered
from
any
in
which
she
had
spoken
for
two
hours
of
course
it
will
cried
from
beneath
the
window
be
under
the
least
mite
of
concern
about
anything
but
looking
out
for
it
when
it
does
to
keep
it
against
next
time
leslie
saw
the
plain
kindly
woman
surrounded
in
a
minute
by
half
a
dozen
eager
young
welcomers
and
claimants
and
a
whole
history
came
out
in
the
unreserved
exclamations
of
the
few
instants
for
which
the
train
delayed
oh
it
a
blessing
you
come
i
do
know
as
emma
jane
would
have
been
married
at
all
if
you
had
we
war
sure
you
get
the
letter
or
as
aunt
nisby
would
spare
you
wanted
to
come
over
on
his
crutches
he
just
got
his
new
ones
and
he
gets
about
but
we
would
let
him
beat
himself
out
for
how
is
hearty
as
would
anyway
be
consistent
with
he
never
got
back
we
all
know
if
you
had
gone
after
him
it
was
a
young
man
voice
that
spoke
these
last
sentences
and
it
grew
tender
at
the
end
you
to
trim
the
cake
began
one
of
the
young
girls
again
crowding
up
she
says
nobody
else
can
nobody
else
can
and
with
a
little
more
mystery
there
the
veil
to
fix
she
says
you
used
to
and
know
about
veils
and
you
was
down
to
lawrence
at
lorany
and
she
wants
things
in
she
dreadful
emma
jane
is
she
wo
have
anything
without
it
exactly
right
the
plain
face
was
full
of
beaming
sympathy
and
readiness
the
spinster
woman
with
the
grass
in
the
eaves
of
her
bonnet
grass
grown
also
over
many
an
old
hope
in
her
own
life
may
be
was
here
in
the
midst
of
young
joy
and
busy
interest
making
them
all
her
own
had
come
on
purpose
looked
for
and
hailed
as
the
one
without
whom
nothing
could
ever
be
done
more
tenderly
yet
as
one
but
for
whom
some
brave
life
and
brother
love
would
have
gone
down
in
the
midst
of
it
all
she
had
had
ear
and
answer
to
the
very
last
for
the
stranger
she
had
comforted
on
her
way
what
difference
did
it
make
whether
she
wore
an
old
bonnet
with
green
grass
in
it
or
a
round
hat
with
a
gay
feather
whether
she
were
fifteen
or
but
for
the
good
she
had
had
time
to
do
whether
lorany
wedding
down
at
lawrence
had
been
really
a
stylish
festival
or
no
there
was
a
beauty
here
which
verily
shone
out
through
all
and
such
a
life
should
have
no
time
to
be
tempted
the
engine
panted
and
the
train
sped
on
she
never
met
her
again
but
these
things
leslie
goldthwaite
had
learned
from
her
these
things
she
laid
by
silently
in
her
heart
and
the
woman
in
the
gray
bonnet
never
knew
the
half
that
she
had
done
after
taking
one
through
wildernesses
of
beauty
after
whirling
one
past
nooks
where
one
could
gladly
linger
whole
summers
it
is
strange
at
what
commonplace
and
graceless
termini
these
railroads
contrive
to
land
one
lovely
wells
river
where
the
road
makes
its
sharp
angle
and
runs
back
again
until
it
strikes
out
eastward
through
the
valley
of
the
ammonoosuc
where
the
waters
leap
to
each
other
and
the
hills
bend
round
in
majestic
greeting
where
our
young
party
cried
out
in
an
ignorance
at
once
blessed
and
pathetic
oh
if
littleton
should
only
be
like
this
or
if
we
could
stop
here
yet
where
one
can
not
stop
because
here
there
is
no
regular
stage
connection
and
nothing
else
to
be
found
very
probably
that
travelers
might
want
save
the
outdoor
glory
wells
river
and
woodsville
were
left
behind
lying
in
the
evening
stillness
of
june
in
the
grand
and
beautiful
disregard
of
things
greater
than
the
world
is
rushing
by
to
seek
and
for
an
hour
more
they
threaded
through
fair
valley
sweeps
and
reaches
past
solitary
hillside
clearings
and
detached
farms
and
the
most
primitive
of
mountain
hamlets
where
the
limit
and
sparseness
of
neighborhood
drew
forth
from
a
gentleman
sitting
behind
them
come
doubtless
from
some
suburban
home
where
numberless
household
wants
kept
horse
and
wagon
perpetually
on
the
way
for
city
or
village
the
suggestive
query
i
wonder
what
they
do
here
when
they
out
of
saleratus
they
brought
them
up
as
against
a
dead
wall
of
dreariness
and
disappointment
at
the
littleton
station
it
had
been
managed
as
it
always
is
the
train
had
turned
most
ingeniously
into
a
corner
whence
there
was
scarcely
an
outlook
upon
anything
of
all
the
magnificence
that
must
yet
be
lying
close
about
them
and
here
was
only
a
tolerably
country
town
filled
up
to
just
the
point
that
excludes
the
picturesque
and
does
not
attain
to
the
highly
civilized
and
into
the
heart
of
this
they
were
to
be
borne
and
to
be
shut
up
there
this
summer
night
with
the
full
moon
flooding
mountain
and
river
and
the
woods
whispering
up
their
peace
to
heaven
it
was
bad
enough
but
worse
came
the
hotel
coach
was
waiting
and
they
hastened
to
secure
their
seats
giving
their
checks
to
the
driver
who
disappeared
with
a
handful
of
these
and
others
leaving
his
horses
with
the
reins
tied
to
the
and
a
boy
ten
years
old
upon
the
box
there
were
heads
out
anxiously
at
either
side
between
concern
for
safety
of
body
and
of
property
linceford
looked
uneasily
toward
the
confused
group
upon
the
platform
from
among
whom
luggage
began
to
be
drawn
out
in
a
fashion
regardless
of
covers
and
corners
the
large
russet
trunk
with
the
black
h
the
two
ones
with
hadden
in
full
the
two
square
these
one
by
one
were
dragged
and
whirled
toward
the
vehicle
and
jerked
upon
the
rack
but
the
ark
as
they
called
linceford
huge
light
french
box
and
the
one
precious
receptacle
that
held
all
leslie
pretty
outfit
where
were
these
those
are
not
all
driver
there
is
a
high
black
french
trunk
and
a
russet
leather
one
got
all
you
give
me
checks
for
seb
pieces
and
he
pointed
to
two
strange
articles
of
luggage
waiting
their
turn
to
be
lifted
up
a
long
gray
hair
trunk
with
letters
in
brass
nails
upon
the
lid
and
as
antiquated
a
strapped
and
padlocked
across
the
mouth
suggestive
in
size
and
fashion
of
the
united
states
mail
never
saw
them
before
in
my
life
there
some
dreadful
mistake
what
have
become
of
ours
ca
say
i
sure
do
often
happen
but
them
was
your
checks
linceford
leaned
back
for
an
instant
in
a
breathless
despair
i
must
get
out
and
see
if
you
please
but
ai
no
use
the
things
is
all
cleared
off
then
stooping
to
examine
the
trunk
and
turning
over
the
bag
queer
too
these
things
is
chalked
all
right
for
littleton
must
been
a
mistake
with
the
checks
and
somebody
changed
their
minds
on
the
way
plymouth
most
likely
and
stopped
with
the
wrong
baggage
would
worry
it
as
bad
for
one
as
for
t
other
anyhow
and
they
be
along
no
kind
o
doubt
strays
allers
turns
up
on
this
here
road
no
danger
about
that
i
see
to
havin
these
stowed
away
in
the
and
shouldering
the
bag
he
seized
the
trunk
by
the
handle
and
hauled
it
along
over
the
rough
embankment
and
up
the
steps
flaying
one
side
as
he
went
but
dear
me
what
am
i
to
do
said
linceford
piteously
everything
in
it
that
i
want
my
and
my
wrappers
and
my
they
be
sure
not
to
have
any
bolsters
on
the
beds
and
only
one
feather
in
each
corner
of
the
pillows
but
this
was
only
the
first
surprise
of
annoyance
she
recollected
herself
on
the
instant
and
leaned
back
again
saying
nothing
more
she
had
no
idea
of
amusing
her
unknown
stage
companions
at
any
length
with
her
miseries
only
just
before
they
reached
the
hotel
she
added
low
to
jeannie
out
of
the
unbroken
train
of
her
own
private
lamentation
and
my
after
all
this
dust
and
heat
i
feel
parched
to
a
mummy
and
i
shall
be
an
object
to
behold
leslie
sat
upon
her
right
hand
she
leaned
closer
and
said
quickly
glad
of
the
little
power
to
comfort
i
have
some
here
in
my
bag
linceford
looked
round
at
her
her
face
was
really
bright
as
if
she
had
not
lost
her
one
trunk
also
you
are
a
phoenix
of
a
traveling
companion
you
young
thing
the
lady
thought
and
felt
suddenly
ashamed
of
her
own
unwonted
discomfiture
half
an
hour
afterward
leslie
goldthwaite
flitted
across
the
passage
between
the
two
rooms
they
had
secured
for
their
party
with
a
bottle
in
her
hand
and
a
pair
of
pillows
over
her
arm
ours
is
a
room
too
linceford
and
neither
elinor
nor
i
care
for
more
than
one
pillow
and
here
is
the
these
essential
comforts
and
the
instinct
of
brought
the
grace
and
the
smile
back
fully
to
linceford
face
more
than
that
she
felt
a
gratefulness
and
the
contagion
and
emulation
of
cheerful
patience
under
a
common
misfortune
she
bent
over
and
kissed
leslie
as
she
took
the
bottle
from
her
hand
you
a
dear
little
sunbeam
she
said
we
send
an
imperative
message
down
the
line
and
have
all
our
own
traps
again
the
collar
that
elinor
hadden
had
lent
leslie
was
not
very
becoming
the
sleeves
had
enormous
wristbands
and
were
made
for
double
while
her
own
were
single
moreover
the
brown
silk
net
which
she
had
supposed
thoroughly
trustworthy
had
given
way
all
at
once
into
a
great
hole
under
the
waterfall
and
the
soft
hair
would
fret
itself
through
and
threaten
to
stray
untidily
she
had
two
such
pretty
nets
in
reserve
in
her
missing
trunk
and
she
did
hate
so
to
be
in
any
way
coming
to
pieces
yet
there
was
somehow
a
feeling
that
repaid
it
all
and
even
quieted
the
real
anxiety
as
to
the
final
turning
up
of
their
fugitive
property
not
a
mere
hardly
a
at
all
but
a
gladness
that
had
something
thankful
in
it
if
she
might
not
be
all
leaves
perhaps
after
all
if
she
really
could
even
in
some
slight
thing
care
most
for
the
life
and
spirit
underneath
to
keep
this
sweet
and
pleasant
and
the
fruit
of
it
a
daily
good
and
not
a
bitterness
if
she
could
begin
by
holding
herself
undisturbed
though
obliged
to
wear
a
collar
that
stood
up
behind
and
turned
over
in
front
with
those
lappet
corners
she
had
always
thought
so
ugly
yes
even
though
the
waterfall
should
leak
out
and
ripple
over
stubbornly
though
these
things
must
go
on
for
hours
at
least
and
these
hours
be
spent
unwillingly
in
a
dull
country
tavern
where
the
windows
looked
out
from
one
side
into
a
village
street
and
from
the
other
into
stable
and
clothes
yards
there
would
be
something
for
her
to
do
to
keep
bright
and
help
to
keep
the
others
bright
there
was
a
hope
in
it
the
life
was
more
than
raiment
it
was
better
worth
while
than
to
have
only
got
on
the
nice
round
collar
and
dainty
cuffs
that
fitted
and
suited
her
or
even
the
little
bead
net
that
came
over
in
a
marie
stuart
point
so
prettily
between
the
small
crimped
puffs
of
her
hair
a
little
matter
nothing
to
be
about
only
a
straw
but
if
it
showed
the
possible
way
of
the
wind
the
motive
power
that
might
be
courted
to
set
through
her
life
taking
her
out
of
the
of
vanity
might
she
have
it
in
her
after
all
might
she
even
be
able
to
come
if
need
be
to
the
strength
of
mind
for
wearing
an
old
gray
straw
bonnet
and
bearing
to
be
forty
years
old
and
helping
to
adorn
the
young
and
beautiful
for
looks
that
never
just
so
should
be
bent
again
on
her
leslie
goldthwaite
had
read
of
martyr
and
hero
sufferance
all
her
life
as
she
had
looked
upon
her
poor
the
pang
of
sympathy
had
always
been
these
things
have
been
borne
are
being
borne
in
the
world
how
much
of
the
least
of
them
could
i
endure
i
looking
for
even
the
little
things
of
life
to
be
made
smooth
it
depended
she
began
faintly
and
afar
off
to
see
upon
where
the
true
life
lay
how
far
behind
the
mere
outer
covering
vitality
withdrew
itself
chapter
iv
marmaduke
wharne
up
up
up
from
glory
to
glory
this
was
what
it
seemed
to
leslie
goldthwaite
riding
that
golden
june
morning
over
the
road
that
threaded
along
always
climbing
the
chain
of
hills
that
be
climbed
into
the
nearer
and
nearer
presence
of
those
mountain
majesties
penetrating
farther
and
father
into
the
grand
solitudes
sentineled
forever
by
their
inaccessible
pride
linceford
had
grown
impatient
she
had
declared
it
impossible
when
the
splendid
sunshine
of
that
next
day
challenged
them
forth
out
of
their
dull
sojourn
to
remain
there
hours
longer
waiting
for
anything
trunks
or
none
she
would
go
on
and
wait
at
jefferson
at
least
where
there
was
something
to
console
one
all
possible
precaution
was
taken
all
possible
promises
were
made
the
luggage
should
be
sent
on
next
day
perhaps
that
very
night
wagons
were
going
and
returning
often
now
there
would
be
no
further
trouble
they
might
rest
assured
the
had
a
capital
team
his
very
best
at
their
instant
service
if
they
chose
to
go
on
this
morning
it
could
be
at
the
door
in
twenty
minutes
so
it
was
chartered
and
ordered
round
an
open
mountain
wagon
with
four
horses
their
remaining
luggage
was
secured
upon
it
and
they
themselves
took
their
seats
gayly
who
cares
for
trunks
or
boxes
now
leslie
cried
out
in
joyousness
catching
the
first
preparatory
glimpse
of
grandeur
when
their
road
that
wound
for
a
time
through
the
low
wet
began
to
ascend
a
rugged
hillside
whence
opened
vistas
that
hinted
something
of
the
glory
that
was
to
come
all
the
morning
long
there
wheeled
about
them
and
smiled
out
in
the
sunshine
or
changed
to
grave
grand
reticence
under
the
those
shapes
of
might
and
beauty
that
filled
up
earth
and
heaven
leslie
grew
silent
with
the
hours
of
delight
thoughts
thronged
in
upon
her
all
that
had
been
deepest
and
strongest
in
the
little
of
life
that
she
had
lived
wakened
and
lifted
again
in
such
transcendent
presence
only
the
high
places
of
spirit
can
answer
to
these
high
places
of
god
in
his
creation
now
and
then
jeannie
and
elinor
fell
into
their
chatter
about
their
summer
plans
and
pleasures
and
dress
about
new
york
and
the
new
house
linceford
had
taken
in
west
street
where
they
were
to
visit
her
next
winter
and
participate
for
the
first
time
under
her
matronizing
in
city
gayeties
leslie
wondered
how
they
could
she
only
answered
when
appealed
to
she
felt
as
if
people
were
jogging
her
elbow
and
whispering
distractions
in
the
midst
of
some
noble
eloquence
the
woods
had
a
word
for
her
a
question
and
their
own
sweet
answer
of
help
the
fair
june
leafage
was
out
in
its
young
glory
of
vivid
green
it
reminded
her
of
her
talk
with
cousin
delight
we
love
leaves
for
their
own
sake
trees
and
vines
and
the
very
green
grass
even
so
she
said
to
herself
asking
still
for
the
perfect
parable
that
should
solve
and
teach
all
it
came
with
the
breath
of
wild
grape
vines
hidden
somewhere
in
the
wayside
thickets
under
the
leaf
lies
our
tiny
green
blossom
it
said
and
its
perfume
is
out
on
the
air
folded
in
the
is
a
feathery
bloom
of
seed
or
grain
and
by
and
by
the
fields
will
be
all
waving
with
it
be
sure
that
the
blossom
is
under
the
leaf
elinor
hadden
sweet
always
gentle
and
though
visited
little
yet
with
the
deep
touch
of
earnest
thought
smiling
upon
life
as
life
smiled
upon
her
looked
lovelier
to
leslie
as
this
whisper
made
itself
heard
in
her
heart
and
it
was
with
a
sweeter
patience
and
a
more
believing
kindliness
that
she
answered
and
tried
to
enter
into
her
next
merry
words
there
was
something
different
about
jeannie
she
was
older
there
was
a
kind
of
hard
determination
sometimes
with
her
in
turning
from
suggestions
of
graver
things
the
was
no
longer
there
something
restless
now
and
then
defiant
had
taken
its
place
she
had
caught
a
sound
of
the
deeper
voices
but
her
soul
would
not
yet
turn
to
listen
she
felt
the
blossom
of
life
yearning
under
the
leaf
but
she
bent
the
green
beauty
heedfully
above
it
and
made
believe
it
was
not
there
looking
into
herself
and
about
her
with
asking
eyes
leslie
had
learned
something
already
by
which
she
apprehended
these
things
of
others
heretofore
her
two
friends
had
seemed
to
her
alike
able
both
of
them
to
take
life
innocently
and
carelessly
as
it
came
she
began
now
to
feel
a
difference
her
eyes
were
bent
away
off
toward
the
franconia
hills
when
linceford
leaned
round
to
look
in
them
and
spoke
in
the
tone
her
voice
had
begun
to
take
toward
her
she
felt
one
of
her
strong
likings
her
immense
fancies
as
she
called
them
which
were
really
warm
sympathies
of
the
best
of
her
with
the
best
she
found
in
the
world
for
leslie
goldthwaite
it
seems
to
me
you
are
a
sunbeam
this
morning
she
said
in
her
winning
way
what
kind
of
thoughts
are
going
out
so
far
what
is
it
all
about
a
verse
of
the
psalms
was
ringing
itself
in
leslie
mind
had
been
there
under
all
the
other
vague
musings
and
chance
suggestions
for
many
minutes
of
her
silence
but
she
would
not
have
spoken
it
she
not
for
all
the
world
she
gave
the
lady
one
of
the
chance
suggestions
instead
i
have
been
looking
down
into
that
lovely
hollow
it
seems
like
a
children
party
with
all
the
grave
grown
folks
looking
on
childhood
and
not
a
bad
simile
it
was
not
indeed
it
was
a
wild
basin
within
a
group
of
the
lesser
hills
close
by
full
of
little
feathery
birches
that
twinkled
and
played
in
the
light
breeze
and
gorgeous
sunshine
slanting
in
upon
them
between
the
slopes
that
lay
in
shadow
above
slopes
clothed
with
ranks
of
dark
pines
and
cedars
and
hemlocks
looking
down
seriously
yet
with
a
sort
of
protecting
tenderness
upon
the
shimmer
and
frolic
they
seemed
to
have
climbed
up
out
of
those
which
stood
in
the
half
way
shadow
were
gravest
hoar
old
stems
upon
the
very
tops
were
touched
with
the
glory
that
lavished
itself
below
this
also
was
no
less
a
true
similitude
know
ye
not
this
parable
the
master
said
how
then
shall
ye
know
all
parables
verily
they
lie
about
us
by
the
wayside
and
the
whole
earth
is
vocal
with
the
wisdom
of
the
lord
i
can
not
go
with
our
party
step
by
step
i
have
a
summer
to
spend
with
them
they
came
to
jefferson
at
noon
and
sat
themselves
down
in
the
solemn
high
court
and
council
of
the
mountain
kings
first
they
must
have
rooms
in
the
very
face
of
majesty
they
must
settle
their
traps
you
are
lucky
in
coming
in
for
one
vacancy
made
the
proprietor
said
throwing
open
a
door
that
showed
them
a
commodious
looking
each
way
with
broad
windows
upon
the
circle
of
glory
from
adams
to
lafayette
a
wide
balcony
ran
along
the
southern
side
against
the
window
which
gave
that
aspect
there
were
two
beds
here
and
two
at
least
of
the
party
must
be
content
to
occupy
linceford
of
course
and
it
was
settled
that
jeannie
should
share
it
with
her
upstairs
again
was
choice
of
two
rooms
one
flight
or
two
but
the
first
looked
out
westward
where
was
comparatively
little
of
what
they
had
come
for
higher
up
they
could
have
the
same
outlook
that
the
others
had
a
slanting
ceiling
opened
with
dormer
window
full
upon
the
grandeur
of
washington
and
a
second
faced
southward
to
where
beautiful
blue
dreamy
lafayette
lay
soft
against
the
tender
heaven
oh
let
us
have
this
said
leslie
eagerly
we
do
mind
stairs
and
so
it
was
settled
only
two
days
here
they
began
to
say
when
they
gathered
in
linceford
room
at
nearly
after
a
rest
and
freshening
of
their
toilets
we
might
stay
longer
linceford
answered
but
the
rooms
are
taken
for
us
at
outledge
and
one
ca
settle
and
unpack
when
only
a
lingering
from
day
to
day
all
there
is
here
one
sees
from
the
windows
a
great
deal
to
be
sure
but
it
all
there
at
the
first
glance
we
see
how
we
feel
on
friday
the
thoresbys
are
here
augusta
i
saw
ginevra
on
the
balcony
just
now
they
seem
to
have
a
large
party
with
them
and
i
sure
i
heard
them
talk
of
a
hop
if
your
trunks
would
only
come
they
could
not
in
time
they
can
only
come
in
the
train
that
reaches
littleton
at
six
but
you
go
in
wo
you
is
likely
they
dress
much
here
though
ginevra
thoresby
always
dresses
elinor
and
i
could
just
put
on
our
blue
grenadines
and
you
got
plenty
of
things
in
your
other
boxes
one
of
your
shawls
is
all
you
want
and
we
can
lend
leslie
something
i
only
my
thick
traveling
boots
said
leslie
and
i
feel
fit
without
a
thorough
dressing
it
wo
matter
the
first
night
will
it
leslie
goldthwaite
you
getting
slow
augusta
as
true
as
i
live
there
is
old
marmaduke
wharne
let
augusta
alone
for
not
noticing
a
question
till
she
chooses
to
answer
it
said
jeannie
hadden
laughing
and
who
pray
is
marmaduke
wharne
with
a
name
like
that
if
you
did
say
i
should
make
up
my
mind
to
a
real
hero
right
out
of
a
book
he
an
original
and
yes
he
is
a
hero
of
a
book
too
in
his
way
i
met
him
at
catskill
last
summer
he
stayed
there
the
whole
season
till
they
shut
the
house
up
and
drove
him
down
the
mountain
other
people
came
and
went
took
a
look
and
ran
away
but
he
was
a
fixture
he
says
he
always
does
so
goes
off
somewhere
and
an
ararat
and
there
drifts
up
and
sticks
fast
in
the
winter
he
in
new
york
but
that
a
needle
in
a
haystack
i
never
heard
of
him
till
i
found
him
at
catskill
he
an
and
they
say
had
more
to
his
name
once
it
was
or
or
something
and
there
a
baronetcy
in
the
family
i
do
doubt
myself
that
it
his
and
that
a
part
of
his
oddity
has
been
to
drop
it
he
was
a
poor
preacher
years
ago
and
then
of
a
sudden
he
went
out
to
england
and
came
back
with
plenty
of
money
and
since
then
he
been
an
apostle
and
missionary
among
the
poor
that
his
winter
work
the
summers
as
i
said
he
spends
in
the
hills
most
people
are
half
afraid
of
him
for
he
one
you
get
the
blunt
truth
from
if
you
never
got
it
before
but
come
there
the
gong
ugh
how
they
batter
it
and
we
must
get
through
tea
and
out
upon
the
balcony
to
see
the
sunset
and
the
light
there
no
time
now
girls
for
blue
grenadines
and
it
always
vulgar
to
come
out
in
a
hurry
with
dress
in
a
strange
place
and
linceford
gave
a
last
touch
to
her
hair
straightened
the
things
on
her
shut
down
the
lid
of
a
box
and
led
the
way
from
the
room
out
upon
the
balcony
they
watched
the
long
golden
going
down
of
the
sun
and
the
creeping
shadows
and
the
purple
and
the
upon
the
crests
and
then
the
heaven
gathered
itself
in
its
night
stillness
and
the
mountains
were
grand
in
the
soft
gloom
until
the
full
moon
came
up
over
washington
there
had
been
a
few
words
of
recognition
with
the
thoresby
party
and
then
our
little
group
had
betaken
itself
to
the
eastern
end
of
the
piazza
after
a
while
one
by
one
the
others
strayed
away
and
they
were
left
almost
alone
there
was
a
gathering
and
a
sound
of
voices
about
the
and
presently
came
the
tones
of
the
piano
struck
merrily
they
jarred
somehow
too
for
the
ringing
thrilling
notes
of
a
horn
blown
below
had
just
gone
down
the
diminishing
echoes
from
cliff
to
cliff
and
died
into
a
listening
silence
away
over
one
could
not
tell
where
beyond
the
mysterious
ramparts
it
getting
cold
said
jeannie
impatiently
i
think
we
stayed
here
long
enough
augusta
you
mean
to
get
a
proper
shawl
and
put
some
sort
of
lace
thing
on
your
head
and
come
in
with
us
for
a
look
at
least
at
the
hop
come
nell
come
leslie
you
might
as
well
be
at
home
as
in
a
place
like
this
if
you
only
going
to
mope
it
seems
to
me
said
leslie
more
to
herself
than
to
jeannie
looking
over
upon
the
curves
and
ridges
and
ravines
of
mount
washington
showing
vast
and
solemn
under
the
climbing
moon
as
if
we
had
got
into
a
cathedral
and
the
nerve
was
being
touched
well
that
do
make
shiver
besides
i
did
come
here
to
shiver
i
come
to
have
a
right
good
time
and
to
look
at
the
mountains
as
much
as
is
reasonable
it
was
a
pretty
good
definition
of
what
jeannie
hadden
thought
she
had
come
into
the
world
for
there
was
subtle
indication
in
it
also
that
the
shadow
of
some
doubt
had
not
failed
to
touch
her
either
and
that
this
with
her
was
less
a
careless
instinct
than
a
resolved
conclusion
elinor
in
her
happy
was
ready
for
either
thing
to
stay
in
the
night
splendor
longer
or
to
go
in
it
ended
in
their
going
in
outside
the
moon
wheeled
on
in
her
long
southerly
circuit
the
stars
trembled
in
their
infinite
depths
and
the
mountains
abided
in
awful
might
within
was
a
piano
tinkle
of
gay
music
and
and
the
poor
abridged
reproduction
of
city
revelry
in
the
inadequate
parlor
of
an
unpretending
on
a
carpet
marmaduke
wharne
came
and
looked
in
at
the
doorway
linceford
rose
from
her
seat
upon
the
sofa
close
by
and
gave
him
courteous
greeting
the
season
has
begun
early
and
you
seem
likely
to
have
a
pleasant
summer
here
she
said
with
the
meaning
of
a
common
fashion
of
speech
no
madam
answered
marmaduke
wharne
out
of
his
real
thought
with
a
blunt
emphasis
you
think
not
said
linceford
suavely
in
a
quiet
amusement
it
looks
rather
like
it
it
no
use
for
people
to
bring
their
bodies
to
the
mountains
if
they
ca
bring
souls
in
them
and
marmaduke
wharne
turned
on
his
heel
and
without
further
courtesy
strode
away
what
an
old
grimgriffinhoof
cried
jeannie
under
her
breath
and
elinor
laughed
her
little
musical
laugh
of
fun
linceford
drew
up
her
shawl
and
sat
down
again
the
remnant
of
a
smile
upon
her
face
leslie
goldthwaite
rather
wished
old
marmaduke
wharne
would
come
back
again
and
say
more
but
this
first
glimpse
of
him
was
all
they
got
chapter
hummocks
blown
crystal
clear
by
freedom
northern
wind
leslie
said
the
last
line
of
whittier
glorious
mountain
sonnet
low
to
herself
standing
on
the
balcony
again
that
next
morning
in
the
cold
clear
breeze
the
magnificent
lines
of
the
great
rearing
themselves
before
her
sharply
against
a
cloudless
morning
sky
defining
and
revealing
themselves
anew
freedom
northern
wind
will
take
all
the
wave
out
of
your
hair
and
give
you
a
red
nose
said
jeannie
coming
round
from
her
room
and
upon
leslie
unaware
well
jeannie
a
pretty
thing
to
look
at
in
her
delicate
blue
cambric
morning
dress
gracefully
braided
with
white
with
the
fresh
rose
of
recent
sleep
in
her
young
cheeks
and
the
gladness
of
young
life
in
her
dark
eyes
one
might
look
away
from
the
mountains
to
look
at
her
for
after
all
the
human
beauty
is
the
highest
only
it
must
express
high
things
or
at
last
one
turns
aside
and
there
comes
marmaduke
he
worse
than
the
north
wind
i
stay
to
be
clear
by
him
and
jeannie
in
high
merry
flitted
off
it
is
easy
to
be
merry
and
when
one
new
dress
fits
exquisitely
and
one
hair
has
been
fractious
in
the
doing
up
leslie
had
never
apparently
to
herself
cared
less
somehow
for
self
and
little
vanities
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
going
to
be
quite
easy
for
her
now
and
henceforth
to
care
most
for
the
nobler
things
of
life
the
great
mountain
enthusiasm
had
seized
her
for
the
first
time
and
swept
away
before
it
all
meaner
thought
and
besides
her
trunk
had
been
left
behind
and
she
had
nothing
to
put
herself
into
but
her
plain
brown
traveling
dress
she
let
the
wind
play
with
the
puffs
of
her
hair
and
send
some
little
light
locks
astray
about
her
forehead
she
wrapped
her
shawl
around
her
and
went
and
sat
where
she
had
sat
the
night
before
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
balcony
her
face
toward
the
morning
hills
as
it
had
been
toward
the
evening
radiance
and
purple
shade
marmaduke
wharne
was
moving
up
and
down
stopping
a
little
short
of
her
when
he
turned
keeping
his
own
solitude
as
she
kept
hers
faces
and
figures
glanced
out
at
the
for
an
instant
each
and
the
keen
salute
of
the
north
wind
sent
them
invariably
in
again
nobody
wanted
to
go
with
a
red
nose
or
tossed
hair
to
the
and
breakfast
was
almost
ready
but
presently
linceford
came
and
seeing
wharne
who
always
interested
and
amused
her
she
ventured
forth
bidding
him
madam
it
a
good
morning
a
little
sharp
is
it
she
said
shrugging
her
shoulders
together
irresolute
about
further
lingering
ah
leslie
let
me
introduce
you
to
the
reverend
wharne
my
young
friend
and
traveling
companion
miss
leslie
goldthwaite
wharne
have
you
two
driven
everybody
else
off
or
is
it
the
nipping
air
i
think
it
is
either
that
they
have
not
said
their
prayers
this
morning
or
that
they
do
know
their
daily
bread
when
they
see
it
they
think
it
is
only
saleratus
cakes
and
maple
molasses
as
cross
this
morning
as
last
night
the
lady
questioned
playfully
not
cross
at
all
linceford
only
jarred
upon
continually
by
these
people
we
have
here
just
now
it
was
different
two
years
ago
but
jefferson
is
getting
to
be
too
well
known
the
mountain
places
are
being
spoiled
one
after
another
people
will
come
you
ca
help
that
yes
they
will
come
and
frivel
about
the
gates
without
ever
once
entering
in
shall
ascend
into
the
hill
of
the
lord
and
who
shall
stand
in
his
holy
place
he
that
hath
clean
hands
and
a
pure
heart
who
hath
not
lifted
up
his
soul
unto
vanity
leslie
goldthwaite
face
quickened
and
glowed
they
were
the
psalm
lines
that
had
haunted
her
thought
yesterday
among
the
opening
visions
of
the
marmaduke
wharne
bent
his
keen
eyes
upon
her
from
under
their
gray
brows
noting
her
narrowly
she
wist
not
that
she
was
noted
or
that
her
face
shone
one
soul
here
at
least
was
what
the
stern
old
man
said
to
himself
in
that
moment
he
was
cynical
and
intolerant
here
among
the
mountains
where
he
felt
the
holy
places
desecrated
and
the
gift
of
god
unheeded
in
the
haunts
of
city
misery
and
vice
misery
and
vice
shut
in
upon
itself
with
no
broad
outlook
to
the
heavens
he
was
tender
with
the
love
of
christ
himself
house
shall
be
called
the
house
of
prayer
but
these
have
made
it
a
den
of
thieves
it
is
true
not
alone
of
the
temples
built
with
hands
is
that
fair
how
do
you
mr
wharne
the
sudden
impetuous
questions
come
from
leslie
goldthwaite
i
see
what
i
see
the
whole
said
leslie
more
restrainedly
she
remembered
her
respect
for
age
and
office
yet
she
felt
sorely
tempted
shy
proud
girl
as
she
was
to
take
up
cudgels
for
her
friends
at
least
wharne
liked
her
the
better
for
that
they
turn
away
from
this
with
five
words
the
toll
of
custom
or
half
a
look
when
the
wind
is
north
and
they
go
in
to
what
you
saw
last
night
after
all
is
it
just
either
way
may
one
be
as
selfish
as
the
other
people
were
kind
and
bright
and
pleasant
with
each
other
last
night
is
that
a
bad
thing
no
little
girl
it
is
not
and
marmaduke
wharne
came
nearer
to
leslie
and
looked
at
her
with
a
gentle
look
that
was
wonderfully
beautiful
upon
his
stern
gray
face
only
i
would
have
a
kindness
that
should
go
deep
coming
from
a
depth
there
are
two
things
for
live
men
and
women
to
do
to
receive
from
god
and
to
give
out
to
their
fellows
one
can
not
be
done
without
the
other
no
fruit
without
the
drinking
of
the
sunshine
no
true
tasting
of
the
sunshine
that
is
not
gathering
itself
toward
the
ripening
of
fruit
here
it
was
again
more
teaching
to
the
point
as
we
always
do
get
it
with
a
seeming
strangeness
whether
it
be
for
mind
only
or
for
soul
you
never
heard
of
a
new
name
or
fact
in
history
that
did
not
come
out
again
presently
in
some
fresh
or
further
mention
or
allusion
it
is
the
tender
training
of
him
before
whom
our
life
is
of
so
great
value
at
this
moment
the
gong
sounded
again
saleratus
cakes
and
maple
molasses
were
ready
and
they
all
went
in
leslie
saw
imogen
thoresby
change
seats
with
her
mother
because
the
draught
from
the
door
was
less
in
her
place
and
take
the
pale
top
cake
from
the
plate
leaving
a
brown
one
for
the
mother
everybody
likes
brown
cakes
best
and
it
was
very
unbecoming
to
sit
opposite
a
great
unshaded
window
to
say
nothing
of
the
draught
surely
a
little
blossom
peeped
out
here
from
under
the
leaf
leslie
thought
imogen
thoresby
might
be
forgiven
for
having
done
her
curls
so
elaborately
and
put
on
such
an
elegant
wrapper
even
for
having
ventured
only
a
out
at
the
balcony
door
when
she
found
the
wind
was
north
the
parable
was
already
teaching
her
both
ways
i
do
not
mean
to
preach
upon
every
page
i
have
begun
by
trying
to
tell
you
how
a
great
influencing
thought
was
given
into
leslie
life
and
began
to
unravel
for
her
perplexing
questions
that
had
troubled
her
questions
that
come
i
think
to
many
a
young
girl
just
entering
upon
the
world
as
they
came
to
her
how
in
the
simple
history
of
her
summer
among
the
mountains
a
great
deal
solved
itself
and
grew
clear
i
would
like
to
succeed
in
making
you
divine
this
as
you
follow
out
the
simple
history
itself
just
in
time
cried
jeannie
hadden
running
up
into
leslie
room
at
that
day
there
a
stage
over
from
littleton
and
your
trunk
is
being
brought
up
this
minute
and
the
and
the
came
on
too
after
all
and
the
queerest
people
with
them
added
elinor
entering
behind
her
they
both
stood
back
and
were
silent
as
a
man
came
heavily
along
the
passage
with
the
trunk
upon
his
shoulder
he
set
it
down
and
unfastened
the
straps
and
in
a
minute
more
was
gone
and
leslie
had
the
lid
open
all
there
just
as
it
had
been
in
her
own
room
at
home
three
days
ago
her
face
brightened
seeing
her
little
treasures
again
she
had
borne
it
well
she
had
been
able
to
enjoy
without
them
but
she
was
very
glad
that
they
were
come
it
nice
that
dinner
is
at
here
and
that
nobody
dresses
until
now
make
haste
and
get
on
something
pretty
augusta
wo
let
us
get
out
organdies
but
we
determined
on
the
blue
grenadines
awfully
hot
hot
enough
for
anything
do
your
hair
over
the
high
rats
just
for
once
i
always
get
into
such
a
fuss
with
them
and
i
ca
bear
to
waste
the
time
how
will
this
do
leslie
unpinned
from
its
cambric
cover
a
gray
iron
barége
with
a
narrow
puffing
round
the
hem
of
the
full
skirt
and
the
little
pointed
bertha
cape
with
it
lay
bright
cherry
ribbons
for
the
neck
and
hair
lovely
make
haste
and
come
down
to
our
room
and
having
to
dress
herself
jeannie
ran
off
again
and
elinor
shut
the
door
it
was
nice
to
have
on
everything
fresh
to
have
got
her
feet
into
rosetted
slippers
instead
of
heavy
balmoral
boots
to
feel
the
lightness
and
grace
of
her
own
movement
as
she
went
downstairs
and
along
the
halls
in
floating
folds
of
delicate
barége
after
wearing
the
close
uncomfortable
with
the
sense
of
dust
and
fatigue
that
clung
about
it
to
have
a
little
flutter
of
bright
ribbon
in
her
hair
that
she
knew
was
as
elinor
said
the
prettiest
part
of
her
it
was
pleasant
to
see
linceford
looked
pleased
as
she
opened
her
door
to
her
and
to
have
her
say
you
always
do
get
on
exactly
the
right
thing
there
was
a
fresh
feeling
of
pleasure
even
in
looking
over
at
washington
and
shadowed
in
his
miles
of
heights
and
depths
as
she
sat
by
the
cool
east
window
feeling
quite
her
dainty
self
again
dress
is
but
the
outside
thing
as
beauty
is
but
skin
deep
but
there
is
a
deal
of
inevitable
pleasurable
or
uncomfortable
and
leslie
had
a
good
right
to
be
thoroughly
comfortable
now
the
blinds
to
the
balcony
window
were
closed
that
led
to
a
funny
little
episode
presently
an
odd
commentary
on
the
question
as
it
had
come
up
to
them
in
graver
fashion
outside
to
two
chairs
just
under
the
window
came
a
couple
newly
arrived
the
identical
proprietors
of
the
exchanged
luggage
it
was
an
elderly
countryman
and
his
wife
they
too
had
had
their
privations
and
anxieties
and
the
outset
of
their
evidently
unusual
travels
had
been
marred
in
its
pleasure
in
plain
truth
the
good
woman
was
manifestly
soured
by
her
experience
right
square
before
the
blinds
she
turned
her
back
unconscious
of
the
audience
within
lifted
her
elbows
like
to
raise
her
draperies
and
settled
herself
with
a
dissatisfied
flounce
that
expressed
beforehand
what
she
was
about
to
put
in
words
for
part
she
announced
deliberately
i
think
the
white
mountains
is
a
clear
good
large
hummocks
anyway
returned
her
companion
you
know
what
i
mean
ai
worth
comin
for
losin
baggage
everything
we
enough
sight
better
ha
stayed
at
plymouth
an
if
it
had
ben
for
your
dunderheadedness
givin
up
the
checks
an
never
stoppin
to
see
what
was
comin
of
trunks
or
hencoops
we
might
there
somethin
to
see
there
that
little
bridge
leadin
over
to
the
swings
and
seats
across
the
river
was
real
pretty
and
pleasant
and
the
cars
comin
in
an
startin
off
right
at
the
back
door
made
it
lively
i
alwers
like
to
see
passin
the
attitudes
inside
the
blinds
were
something
at
this
moment
linceford
in
a
spasm
of
suppressed
laughter
herself
held
her
handkerchief
to
her
lips
with
one
hand
and
motioned
peremptory
silence
to
the
girls
with
the
other
jeannie
was
noiselessly
clapping
her
hands
and
dancing
from
one
toe
to
the
other
with
delight
leslie
and
elinor
squeezed
each
other
fingers
lightly
and
leaned
forward
together
their
faces
brimming
over
with
fun
and
the
former
whispered
with
emphatic
pantomime
to
linceford
wharne
were
only
here
you
ben
worried
said
the
man
and
you
ben
comin
up
to
gradooal
you
do
take
in
if
one
of
these
hills
was
set
out
in
our
fields
to
home
you
think
it
was
something
more
than
a
hummock
i
guess
well
why
ai
they
then
it
the
best
way
to
put
things
where
you
can
see
to
an
advantage
they
all
in
the
way
of
each
other
here
and
do
show
for
nothing
to
speak
of
worried
i
guess
i
hev
ben
i
sha
git
over
it
till
i
got
home
an
ben
settled
down
a
week
a
mercy
i
ever
laid
eyes
agin
on
that
black
alpacky
well
the
folks
felt
wuss
that
lost
them
trunks
i
bet
they
had
something
more
in
than
black
alpackys
that
do
comfort
me
none
i
had
tribulation
well
come
do
be
grouty
hannah
we
got
through
the
wust
of
it
and
if
you
ai
satisfied
why
we
go
back
to
plymouth
again
i
can
stand
it
awhile
i
guess
if
four
dollars
a
day
he
had
evidently
sat
still
a
good
while
for
him
honest
man
and
he
got
up
with
this
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
looking
at
the
hummocks
which
signified
greater
meanings
to
him
than
to
his
wife
linceford
came
over
and
put
the
window
down
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
laugh
now
however
much
of
further
entertainment
might
be
cut
off
hannah
jumped
up
electrified
as
the
sash
went
down
behind
her
john
john
there
folks
in
there
likely
said
john
with
quiet
relish
of
amends
what
good
for
me
do
for
them
chapter
vi
dakie
thayne
grimgriffinhoof
wo
speak
to
you
said
jeannie
hadden
after
tea
upon
the
balcony
she
was
mistaken
there
was
something
different
still
in
leslie
goldthwaite
look
as
she
came
out
under
the
sunset
light
from
the
looks
that
prevailed
in
the
thoresby
group
when
they
too
made
their
appearance
the
one
moved
her
consciousness
and
thought
sent
forth
not
fluttering
in
her
robes
and
ribbons
with
the
others
there
was
a
little
air
and
bustle
as
of
people
coming
into
an
in
presence
of
a
full
house
they
said
lovely
and
splendid
of
course
their
little
word
of
applause
for
the
scenic
grandeur
of
mountain
and
heaven
and
then
the
half
of
them
turned
their
backs
upon
it
and
commenced
talking
together
about
whether
waterfalls
were
really
to
be
given
up
or
not
and
of
how
people
were
going
to
look
in
bonnets
linceford
told
the
hummux
story
to
marmaduke
wharne
the
old
man
laughed
till
the
thoresby
party
turned
to
see
but
i
like
one
thing
he
said
the
woman
was
honest
her
alpacky
was
most
to
her
and
she
owned
up
to
it
the
regular
thing
being
done
outside
the
company
drifted
back
as
the
shadows
fell
to
the
parlor
again
linceford
party
moved
also
and
drifted
with
the
rest
marmaduke
wharne
quite
graciously
walked
after
the
lancers
was
just
forming
the
bear
is
playing
tame
and
amiable
whispered
jeannie
but
eat
you
up
for
all
that
i
would
trust
him
he
going
to
watch
to
see
how
wicked
you
be
i
shall
let
him
see
replied
leslie
quietly
miss
goldthwaite
you
for
the
dance
for
the
and
kind
and
pleasant
eh
the
bear
said
coming
to
her
side
within
the
room
if
anybody
asks
me
answered
leslie
with
brave
simplicity
i
like
dancing
much
i
find
you
a
partner
then
said
wharne
she
looked
up
surprised
but
he
was
quite
in
earnest
he
walked
across
the
room
and
brought
back
with
him
a
lad
of
thirteen
or
so
well
grown
for
his
age
and
bright
and
but
only
a
boy
and
a
little
shy
and
stiff
at
first
as
boys
have
to
be
for
a
while
leslie
had
seen
him
before
in
the
afternoon
rolling
the
balls
through
a
solitary
game
of
croquet
and
afterward
taking
his
tea
by
himself
at
the
lower
end
of
the
table
he
had
seemed
to
belong
to
nobody
and
as
yet
hardly
to
have
got
the
run
of
the
place
this
is
master
thayne
miss
leslie
goldthwaite
and
i
think
he
would
like
to
dance
if
you
please
master
thayne
made
a
proper
bow
and
glanced
up
at
the
young
girl
with
a
smile
lurking
behind
the
diffidence
in
his
face
leslie
smiled
outright
and
held
out
her
hand
it
was
not
a
brilliant
début
perhaps
the
haddens
had
been
appropriated
by
a
couple
of
youths
in
frock
coats
and
orthodox
kids
with
a
suspicion
of
mustaches
and
one
of
the
thoresbys
had
a
young
captain
of
cavalry
with
gold
bars
on
his
shoulders
elinor
hadden
raised
her
pretty
eyebrows
and
put
as
much
of
a
look
into
her
happy
little
face
as
it
could
hold
when
she
found
her
friend
so
paired
at
her
right
hand
it
very
good
of
you
to
stand
up
with
me
said
the
boy
simply
awful
slow
not
knowing
anybody
are
you
here
alone
asked
leslie
yes
there
was
nobody
to
come
with
me
oliver
my
brother
will
come
by
and
by
and
perhaps
my
uncle
and
the
rest
of
them
to
meet
me
where
i
to
be
down
among
the
mountains
we
all
broken
up
this
summer
and
i
to
take
care
of
myself
then
you
do
stay
here
no
i
only
came
this
way
to
see
what
it
was
like
i
got
a
jolly
place
engaged
for
me
at
outledge
outledge
why
we
are
going
there
are
you
that
jolly
repeated
the
boy
pausing
a
second
for
a
fresher
or
politer
word
but
unable
to
supply
a
synonym
i
glad
you
think
so
answered
leslie
with
her
genuine
smile
again
the
two
had
already
made
up
their
minds
to
be
friends
in
fact
master
thayne
would
hardly
have
acquiesced
in
being
led
up
for
introduction
to
any
other
young
girl
in
the
room
there
had
been
something
in
leslie
goldthwaite
face
that
had
looked
kind
and
sisterly
to
him
he
had
no
fear
of
a
snub
with
her
and
these
things
wharne
had
read
in
his
behalf
as
well
he
a
queer
old
fellow
that
wharne
is
he
pursued
master
thayne
after
forward
and
back
as
he
turned
his
partner
to
place
but
he
the
only
one
that
had
anything
to
say
to
me
and
i
like
him
i
been
down
to
the
old
mill
with
him
those
people
motioning
slightly
toward
the
other
set
where
the
thoresbys
were
dancing
were
down
there
too
you
ought
to
have
seen
them
look
do
they
hate
him
though
hate
him
why
should
they
do
that
oh
i
do
know
people
feel
each
other
out
i
suppose
and
a
word
of
his
is
as
much
as
a
whole
preach
of
anybody
else
he
says
a
word
now
and
then
and
it
hits
yes
responded
leslie
laughing
what
you
do
it
for
whispered
elinor
in
hands
across
i
like
him
he
got
something
to
say
returned
leslie
augusta
looking
at
you
like
a
hen
after
a
stray
chicken
she
all
but
clucking
now
wharne
will
tell
her
but
wharne
was
not
in
the
room
he
came
back
just
as
leslie
was
making
her
way
again
after
the
dance
to
linceford
will
you
do
a
galop
with
me
presently
if
you
do
get
a
better
partner
i
mean
said
master
thayne
that
would
be
much
of
a
promise
answered
leslie
smiling
i
will
at
any
rate
that
is
if
after
i
spoken
to
mrs
linceford
wharne
came
up
and
said
something
to
young
thayne
just
then
and
the
latter
turned
eagerly
to
leslie
the
telescope
fixed
out
on
the
balcony
and
you
can
see
jupiter
and
three
of
his
moons
we
must
make
haste
before
moon
up
will
you
go
and
look
mrs
linceford
asked
wharne
of
the
lady
as
leslie
reached
her
side
they
went
with
him
and
master
thayne
followed
jeannie
and
elinor
and
the
miss
thoresbys
were
doing
the
inevitable
promenade
after
the
dance
under
difficulties
who
is
your
young
friend
inquired
linceford
with
a
shade
of
doubt
in
her
whisper
as
they
came
out
on
the
balcony
master
leslie
began
to
introduce
but
stopped
the
name
which
she
had
not
been
quite
certain
of
escaped
her
my
name
is
dakie
thayne
said
the
boy
with
a
bow
to
the
matron
now
linceford
if
you
just
sit
here
said
wharne
placing
a
chair
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
come
to
you
first
but
it
all
right
he
added
in
a
low
tone
over
her
shoulder
he
a
nice
boy
and
linceford
put
her
eye
to
the
telescope
dakie
thayne
it
a
queer
name
and
yet
it
seems
as
if
i
had
heard
it
before
she
said
looking
away
through
the
mystic
tube
into
space
and
seeing
jupiter
with
his
moons
in
a
fair
round
picture
framed
expressly
to
her
eye
yet
sending
a
thought
at
the
same
time
up
and
down
the
lists
of
a
mental
directory
trying
to
place
dakie
thayne
among
people
she
had
heard
of
i
be
responsible
for
the
name
answered
marmaduke
wharne
is
a
nickname
of
course
but
they
always
call
me
so
and
i
like
it
best
the
boy
was
explaining
to
leslie
while
they
waited
in
the
doorway
then
her
turn
came
leslie
had
never
looked
through
a
telescope
upon
the
stars
before
she
forgot
the
galop
and
the
piano
tinkled
out
its
gayest
notes
unheard
it
seems
like
coming
all
the
way
back
she
said
when
she
moved
away
for
dakie
thayne
then
they
wheeled
the
telescope
upon
its
pivot
eastward
and
met
our
own
moon
coming
up
as
if
in
a
grand
jealousy
to
assert
herself
within
her
small
domain
and
put
out
faint
far
satellites
of
lordlier
planets
they
looked
upon
her
mystic
glistening
and
down
her
awful
craters
and
from
these
they
seemed
to
drop
a
little
as
a
bird
might
and
alight
on
the
looming
close
at
hand
with
their
huge
rough
crests
and
sides
and
sheer
escarpments
white
with
nakedness
and
so
got
home
again
leslie
with
her
maps
and
gazetteer
had
done
no
traveling
like
this
she
would
not
have
cared
if
she
had
known
that
imogen
thoresby
was
looking
for
her
within
to
present
at
his
own
request
the
cavalry
captain
she
did
not
know
in
the
least
absorbed
in
her
pure
enjoyment
that
marmaduke
wharne
was
deliberately
trying
her
and
confirming
his
estimate
of
her
in
these
very
things
she
danced
her
galop
with
dakie
thayne
after
she
went
back
the
cavalry
captain
was
introduced
and
asked
for
it
that
was
something
as
hans
andersen
would
say
but
what
a
goose
not
to
have
managed
better
was
what
imogen
thoresby
thought
concerning
it
as
the
gold
bars
turned
themselves
away
leslie
goldthwaite
had
taken
what
came
to
her
and
she
had
had
an
innocent
merry
time
she
had
been
glad
to
be
dressed
nicely
and
to
look
her
best
but
somehow
she
had
not
thought
of
that
much
after
all
the
old
uncomfortableness
had
not
troubled
her
to
be
in
better
that
the
whole
of
it
she
thought
to
herself
with
her
head
upon
the
pillow
she
put
it
in
words
mentally
in
the
same
fashion
in
which
she
would
have
spoken
it
to
cousin
delight
one
must
look
out
for
that
and
keep
at
it
the
way
and
it
what
has
kept
me
from
worrying
and
despising
myself
it
only
happened
so
this
time
it
was
wharne
not
i
but
i
suppose
one
can
always
find
something
by
trying
and
the
trying
the
rest
wandered
off
into
a
happy
musing
and
the
musing
merged
into
a
dream
object
and
motive
the
seeking
first
she
had
touched
upon
that
at
last
with
a
little
comprehension
of
its
working
she
liked
dakie
thayne
the
next
day
they
saw
a
good
deal
of
him
he
joined
himself
gradually
but
not
obtrusively
to
their
party
they
included
him
in
their
morning
game
of
croquet
this
was
at
her
instance
he
was
standing
aside
not
expecting
to
be
counted
in
though
he
had
broken
off
his
game
of
solitaire
and
driven
the
balls
up
to
the
as
they
came
out
upon
the
ground
the
thoresby
set
had
ignored
him
always
being
too
many
already
among
themselves
and
he
was
only
a
boy
this
morning
there
were
only
imogen
and
etty
the
youngest
a
had
gone
off
up
the
cherry
mountain
road
and
ginevra
was
upstairs
packing
for
the
thoresbys
had
also
suddenly
decided
to
leave
for
outledge
on
the
morrow
thoresby
declared
in
confidence
to
linceford
that
old
wharne
would
make
any
house
intolerable
and
that
jefferson
at
any
rate
was
no
place
for
more
than
a
week
stay
she
would
have
it
mentioned
in
the
house
however
that
she
was
going
till
the
time
came
it
made
such
an
ado
and
everybody
plans
were
at
loose
ends
among
the
mountains
ready
to
fix
themselves
to
anything
at
a
day
notice
they
might
have
tomorrow
stage
loaded
to
crushing
if
they
did
not
take
care
but
i
thought
devreaux
and
the
klines
were
with
you
remarked
linceford
of
our
party
oh
no
indeed
we
only
fell
in
with
them
here
fell
in
with
them
became
inseparable
for
a
week
and
now
were
stealing
a
march
them
lest
there
might
be
an
overcrowding
of
the
stage
and
an
impossibility
of
getting
outside
seats
thoresby
was
a
woman
of
an
imposing
elegance
and
dignity
with
her
large
curls
of
resplendent
gray
hair
high
up
on
her
temples
her
dark
eyebrows
and
her
own
perfect
white
teeth
yet
she
could
do
a
shabby
thing
you
see
a
thing
made
shabby
by
its
motive
the
devreaux
and
klines
were
only
floating
people
boarding
about
not
permanently
valuable
as
acquaintances
well
enough
to
know
when
one
met
them
that
was
all
thoresby
had
daughters
she
was
obliged
to
calculate
as
to
what
was
worth
while
linceford
had
an
elegant
establishment
in
new
york
she
had
young
sisters
to
bring
out
there
was
suitability
here
and
the
girls
would
naturally
find
themselves
happy
together
dakie
thayne
developed
brilliantly
at
croquet
he
and
leslie
with
etty
thoresby
against
imogen
and
the
haddens
swept
triumphantly
around
the
course
and
came
in
to
the
stake
before
there
had
been
even
a
rover
upon
the
other
side
except
indeed
as
they
were
roving
away
off
over
the
bank
and
down
the
road
from
the
sloping
uneven
ground
the
most
extraordinary
field
in
truth
on
which
croquet
was
ever
attempted
but
then
you
can
not
expect
a
level
velvet
lawn
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
children
always
get
the
best
of
it
at
croquet
when
they
know
anything
at
all
said
imogen
thoresby
discontentedly
throwing
down
her
mallet
you
awfully
etty
etty
began
an
indignant
denial
unable
to
endure
the
double
accusation
of
being
a
child
she
a
girl
in
her
fourteenth
year
and
of
poking
but
imogen
walked
away
quite
unconcernedly
and
jeannie
hadden
followed
her
these
two
as
nearest
in
age
were
growing
intimate
ginevra
was
almost
too
old
she
was
twenty
they
played
a
game
then
leslie
and
etty
against
elinor
and
dakie
thayne
but
elinor
declared
laughing
all
the
same
in
her
imperturbably
way
that
not
only
etty
pokes
were
against
her
but
that
dakie
would
croquet
leslie
ball
downhill
nothing
ever
really
put
elinor
hadden
out
the
girls
said
of
her
except
when
her
hair
would
go
up
and
then
it
was
funny
to
see
her
it
was
a
sunbeam
in
a
snarl
or
a
snow
flurry
out
of
a
blue
sky
this
in
parenthesis
however
it
was
quite
true
as
she
alleged
that
dakie
thayne
had
taken
up
already
that
chivalrous
attitude
toward
leslie
goldthwaite
which
would
not
let
him
act
otherwise
than
as
her
loyal
knight
even
though
opposed
to
her
at
croquet
you
have
enough
of
that
boy
said
linceford
when
leslie
came
in
and
found
her
at
her
window
that
overlooked
the
wickets
nothing
like
a
masculine
creature
of
that
age
for
adoring
and
monopolizing
a
girl
two
or
three
years
older
he
make
you
mend
his
gloves
and
he
beg
your
for
and
when
not
dancing
or
playing
croquet
with
him
he
be
after
you
with
some
or
other
wanting
you
to
sympathize
and
help
know
their
tricks
and
their
manners
but
she
looked
amused
and
kind
while
she
threatened
and
leslie
only
smiled
back
and
said
nothing
presently
fresh
fun
gathered
in
linceford
eyes
you
making
queer
friends
child
do
you
know
at
the
beginning
of
your
travels
we
shall
have
and
and
and
all
the
rest
of
them
before
we
get
much
farther
do
breathe
a
word
girls
she
went
on
turning
toward
them
all
and
brimming
over
with
merriment
and
mischief
but
there
the
best
joke
brewing
it
just
like
a
farce
is
the
door
shut
elinor
and
are
the
thoresbys
gone
upstairs
they
going
with
us
you
know
and
there
nothing
to
be
said
about
it
and
it
partly
to
get
away
from
marmaduke
wharne
well
going
too
and
it
greatly
because
they
spoiling
the
place
for
him
here
he
thinks
he
try
outledge
and
there
nothing
to
be
said
about
that
either
and
i
the
unhappy
depositary
of
all
their
complaints
and
secrets
and
if
nobody
stopped
they
all
be
off
in
the
stage
with
us
morning
i
could
help
telling
you
for
it
was
too
good
to
keep
the
secrets
were
secrets
through
the
day
and
linceford
had
her
quiet
fun
and
opportunity
for
her
demure
teasing
how
long
since
outledge
was
discovered
and
settled
by
the
moderns
i
mean
said
wharne
what
chance
will
one
really
have
of
quiet
there
well
really
to
be
honest
wharne
i
afraid
outledge
will
be
just
at
the
rampant
stage
this
summer
it
the
second
year
of
anything
like
general
accommodation
and
everybody
has
just
heard
of
it
and
the
knowing
and
stylish
thing
to
go
there
for
a
week
or
two
it
may
be
quiet
but
then
there
be
a
jam
there
be
hops
and
tableaux
and
theatricals
of
course
interspersed
with
at
the
tomb
of
jehoshaphat
or
whatever
mountain
solemnity
stands
for
that
it
be
human
nature
right
over
again
be
assured
mr
wharne
yet
somehow
wharne
would
not
be
frightened
from
his
determination
until
the
evening
when
plans
came
out
and
and
wonders
and
lamentations
began
yes
we
have
decided
quite
suddenly
the
girls
want
to
see
outledge
and
there
a
pleasant
party
of
friends
you
know
one
ca
always
have
that
we
shall
probably
fill
a
stage
so
they
will
take
us
through
instead
of
dropping
us
at
the
crawford
house
in
this
manner
thoresby
explained
to
her
dear
friend
devreaux
we
shall
be
quite
sorry
to
lose
you
all
but
it
would
only
have
been
a
day
or
so
longer
at
any
rate
our
rooms
are
engaged
for
the
fifteenth
at
saratoga
we
very
little
time
left
for
the
mountains
and
it
would
be
worth
while
to
go
off
the
regular
track
we
shall
probably
go
down
to
the
profile
on
saturday
and
then
jefferson
was
no
place
really
to
at
you
got
the
whole
in
the
first
minute
etc
linceford
i
going
up
to
unpack
my
valise
and
make
myself
comfortable
again
all
things
come
round
or
go
by
i
find
if
one
only
keeps
one
self
quiet
but
i
shall
look
in
upon
you
at
outledge
yet
these
were
the
stairway
words
of
marmaduke
wharne
gets
the
whole
in
the
first
minute
how
can
they
keep
saying
that
look
elinor
and
see
if
you
can
tell
me
where
we
are
was
leslie
cry
as
early
next
morning
she
drew
up
her
to
look
forth
on
what
last
night
had
lain
there
underneath
them
the
great
basin
between
starr
king
behind
and
the
roots
of
that
lesser
range
far
down
above
which
the
blue
lafayette
uprears
itself
an
enormous
valley
filled
with
evergreen
forest
over
whose
tall
pines
and
cedars
one
looked
as
if
they
were
but
juniper
and
blueberry
bushes
far
up
above
whose
heads
the
real
average
of
the
vast
heaped
itself
in
swelling
masses
miles
and
miles
of
beetling
height
and
solid
breadth
this
morning
it
was
gone
only
the
great
peaks
showed
themselves
as
a
shore
or
here
and
there
a
green
island
in
a
vast
vaporous
lake
the
had
come
down
among
the
heights
condensing
the
warm
exhalations
of
the
that
had
been
shone
into
all
day
yesterday
by
the
long
summer
sun
till
when
he
lifted
himself
once
more
out
of
the
east
sending
his
leaping
light
from
crest
to
crest
white
fallen
clouds
were
tumbling
and
wreathing
themselves
about
the
knees
and
against
the
mighty
bosoms
of
the
giants
and
at
their
feet
the
forest
was
a
sea
we
must
dress
and
we
must
look
exclaimed
leslie
as
the
early
summons
came
for
them
oh
dear
oh
dear
if
we
were
only
like
the
birds
or
if
all
this
would
wait
till
we
get
down
please
drop
the
shade
just
a
minute
les
this
glass
is
in
such
a
horrid
light
i
do
seem
to
have
but
half
a
face
and
i
ca
tell
which
is
the
of
that
and
oh
dear
i
no
to
get
into
a
fuss
elinor
had
not
disdained
the
beauty
and
wonder
without
but
it
was
after
all
necessary
to
be
dressed
and
in
a
given
time
and
a
bad
light
for
a
is
such
a
disastrous
thing
i
brushed
out
half
my
crimps
she
said
again
and
my
ruffle
is
basted
in
wrong
side
out
and
altogether
i
got
up
la
but
she
laughed
before
she
had
done
scolding
catching
sight
of
her
own
exaggerated
little
frown
in
the
distorting
glass
that
was
unable
with
all
its
malice
to
spoil
the
bright
young
face
when
it
came
to
smiles
and
dimples
and
then
jeannie
came
knocking
at
the
door
they
had
spare
minutes
after
all
and
the
mists
were
yet
tossing
in
the
valley
when
they
went
down
they
were
growing
filmy
and
floating
away
in
shining
fragments
up
over
the
shoulders
of
the
hills
and
the
lake
was
lower
and
less
and
the
emerging
green
was
like
the
thousand
islands
they
waited
a
little
there
in
the
wide
open
door
together
and
looked
out
upon
it
and
then
the
haddens
went
round
into
their
sister
room
and
leslie
was
left
alone
in
the
rare
sweet
early
air
the
secret
joy
came
whispering
at
her
heart
again
that
there
was
all
this
in
the
world
and
that
one
need
not
be
utterly
dull
and
mean
and
dead
to
it
that
something
in
her
answered
to
the
greatness
overshadowing
her
that
it
was
possible
sometimes
and
that
people
did
reach
out
into
a
larger
life
than
that
of
self
and
how
else
did
the
great
mountains
draw
them
to
themselves
so
but
then
she
would
not
always
be
among
the
mountains
and
so
she
stood
drinking
in
at
her
eyes
all
the
shifting
and
melting
splendors
of
the
marvelous
scene
with
her
thought
busy
once
more
in
its
own
questioning
she
remembered
what
she
had
said
to
cousin
delight
it
is
all
outside
going
and
doing
and
seeing
and
hearing
and
having
in
myself
am
i
good
for
any
more
after
all
or
only
a
green
in
the
sunshine
why
with
that
word
did
it
all
flash
together
for
her
as
a
connected
thing
her
talk
that
morning
many
weeks
ago
that
had
seemed
to
ramble
so
from
one
irrelevant
matter
to
another
from
the
parable
to
her
the
scenes
and
pleasures
she
had
made
for
herself
wondering
if
the
real
would
ever
come
to
the
representing
her
little
feminine
absorptions
and
interests
and
back
to
the
again
ending
with
that
word
the
real
living
is
the
urging
toward
the
fruit
her
day
journey
and
the
hints
of
life
narrowed
suffering
working
that
had
come
to
her
each
with
its
problem
marmaduke
indignant
protest
against
people
who
did
not
know
their
daily
bread
and
his
insistence
upon
the
things
for
human
creatures
to
do
the
and
the
giving
the
taking
from
god
in
the
sunshine
to
grow
the
ripening
into
generous
uses
for
others
was
it
all
one
and
did
it
define
the
whole
and
was
it
identical
in
the
broadest
and
highest
with
that
sublime
double
command
whereon
hang
the
law
and
the
prophets
something
like
this
passed
into
her
mind
and
soul
brightening
there
like
the
morning
it
seemed
in
that
glimpse
so
clear
and
gracious
the
truth
that
had
been
puzzling
her
easy
beautiful
summer
work
only
to
be
shone
upon
to
lift
up
branching
life
and
be
reverently
glad
to
grow
sweet
and
helpful
and
in
one
turn
could
she
not
begin
to
do
that
perhaps
by
ever
so
little
the
fruit
might
be
but
a
berry
yet
it
might
be
fair
and
full
after
its
kind
and
at
least
some
little
bird
might
be
the
better
for
it
all
around
her
too
the
life
of
the
world
that
had
so
troubled
her
who
could
tell
in
the
tangle
of
green
where
the
good
and
the
gift
might
ripen
and
fall
every
little
has
its
seed
jeannie
came
behind
her
again
and
called
her
back
to
the
contradictory
phase
of
self
that
with
us
all
is
almost
ready
like
peter
to
deny
the
true
what
are
you
deep
in
now
les
nothing
only
we
go
from
here
do
we
jeannie
yes
and
a
very
good
thing
for
you
too
you
been
in
the
clouds
long
enough
i
shall
be
glad
to
get
you
to
the
common
level
again
you
no
need
to
be
anxious
i
can
come
down
as
fast
as
anybody
is
the
hard
thing
to
do
let
go
in
and
get
and
cream
for
our
breakfast
the
haddens
were
new
to
mountain
travel
the
thoresbys
literally
were
old
stagers
they
were
up
in
the
before
party
came
out
from
the
dakie
thayne
was
there
too
but
that
was
quite
natural
for
a
boy
they
got
their
outside
seats
by
it
scrambling
up
before
the
horses
were
put
to
and
sitting
there
while
the
hostlers
smiled
at
each
other
over
their
work
there
was
room
for
two
more
and
dakie
thayne
took
a
place
but
the
young
ladies
looked
askance
for
ginevra
had
been
detained
by
her
mother
and
imogen
had
hoped
to
keep
a
seat
for
jeannie
without
drawing
the
whole
party
after
her
and
running
aground
upon
politeness
so
they
drove
round
to
the
door
first
come
first
served
cried
imogen
beckoning
jeannie
who
happened
to
be
there
looking
for
her
friend
i
saved
a
place
for
you
and
jeannie
hadden
nothing
loath
as
a
man
placed
the
mounting
board
sprang
up
and
took
it
then
the
others
came
out
thoresby
and
linceford
got
inside
the
vehicle
at
once
securing
comfortable
back
ginevra
with
leslie
and
elinor
and
one
or
two
others
too
late
for
their
own
interest
but
quite
comprehending
the
thing
to
be
preferred
lingered
while
the
last
trunks
went
on
hoping
for
room
to
be
made
somehow
it
so
gay
on
the
top
going
down
into
the
villages
there
no
fun
inside
said
imogen
complacently
settling
herself
upon
her
perch
wo
there
be
another
stage
only
half
way
this
one
goes
through
i
go
half
way
on
the
other
then
said
ginevra
this
is
the
best
team
and
goes
on
ahead
was
the
reply
you
be
left
behind
cried
thoresby
do
think
of
it
ginevra
ca
that
boy
sit
back
on
the
roof
asked
the
young
lady
that
boy
quite
ignored
the
allusion
but
presently
as
ginevra
moved
toward
the
to
speak
with
her
mother
he
leaned
down
to
leslie
goldthwaite
i
make
room
for
he
said
but
leslie
had
decided
she
could
not
with
effrontery
of
selfishness
take
the
last
possible
place
a
place
already
asked
for
by
another
she
thanked
dakie
thayne
and
with
just
one
little
secret
sigh
got
into
the
interior
placing
herself
by
the
farther
door
at
that
moment
she
missed
something
i
left
my
brown
veil
in
your
room
linceford
and
she
was
about
to
alight
again
to
go
for
it
i
fetch
it
cried
dakie
thayne
from
overhead
and
as
he
spoke
came
down
on
her
side
by
the
wheel
and
springing
around
to
the
house
entrance
disappeared
up
the
stairs
ginevra
then
there
came
a
laugh
and
a
shout
and
some
crinoline
against
the
forward
open
corner
of
the
coach
and
ginevra
thoresby
was
by
the
driver
side
a
little
ashamed
in
spite
of
herself
though
it
was
done
under
cover
of
a
joke
but
all
fair
among
the
mountains
somebody
said
and
possession
nine
points
said
another
and
the
laugh
was
with
her
seemingly
dakie
thayne
flushed
up
hot
without
a
word
when
he
came
out
an
instant
after
i
sorry
said
leslie
with
real
regret
accented
with
honest
indignation
it
your
place
called
out
a
rough
man
who
made
the
third
upon
the
why
do
you
stick
up
for
it
the
color
went
down
slowly
in
the
boy
face
and
a
pride
came
up
in
his
eye
he
put
his
hand
to
his
cap
with
a
little
irony
of
deference
and
lifted
it
off
with
the
grace
of
a
grown
man
i
know
it
my
place
but
the
young
lady
may
keep
it
now
rather
be
a
gentleman
said
dakie
thayne
you
got
the
best
of
it
this
came
from
marmaduke
wharne
as
the
door
closed
upon
the
boy
and
the
stage
rolled
down
the
road
toward
cherry
mountain
there
is
a
best
to
be
got
out
of
everything
but
it
is
neither
the
best
of
place
or
possession
nor
the
chuckle
of
the
last
word
chapter
vii
down
at
outledge
among
the
mountains
somewhere
between
the
androscoggin
and
the
saco
i
do
feel
bound
to
tell
you
precisely
where
and
i
have
only
a
word
to
give
you
for
it
at
all
lies
the
little
neighborhood
of
outledge
an
odd
corner
of
a
great
township
such
as
they
measure
off
in
these
wilds
where
they
take
in
with
some
eligible
locations
of
intervale
land
miles
also
of
pathless
forest
where
the
bear
and
the
moose
are
wandering
still
a
pond
perhaps
filling
up
a
basin
of
acres
and
acres
in
extent
and
a
mountain
or
two
thrown
in
to
keep
off
the
north
wind
a
corner
cut
off
as
its
name
indicates
by
the
outrunning
of
a
precipitous
ridge
of
granite
round
which
a
handful
of
population
had
crept
and
built
itself
a
group
of
dwellings
this
was
the
spot
discovered
and
seized
to
themselves
some
four
or
five
years
since
by
certain
migratory
pioneers
of
fashion
an
old
farmhouse
with
four
plain
rooms
of
generous
dimensions
on
each
floor
in
which
the
first
delighted
summer
party
had
divided
itself
glad
and
grateful
to
occupy
them
double
and
even
treble
bedded
had
become
the
hotel
with
a
name
up
across
the
gable
of
the
new
wing
giant
cairn
house
and
the
eight
original
rooms
made
into
fourteen
the
wing
was
clapped
on
by
its
middle
rushing
out
at
the
front
toward
the
road
to
meet
the
summer
tide
of
travel
as
it
should
surge
by
and
hold
up
to
it
arrestively
its
titular
the
other
half
as
expressively
making

at

as
each
fresh
arrival
seeking
out
the
preferable
rooms
inevitably
did
behind
upon
the
other
side
an
l
provided
new
kitchens
and
over
these
within
a
year
had
been
carried
up
a
second
story
with
a
hall
for
dancing

theatricals
and
traveling
jugglers
up
to
this
hostelry
whirled
daily
from
the
southward
the
great
stage
and
from
the
northward
came
thrice
a
week
wagons
or
coaches
through
the
hills
besides
such
extras
as
might
drive
down
at
any
hour
of
day
or
night
round
the
smooth
curve
of
broad
level
road
that
skirted
the
ledges
from
the
upper
village
pranced
four
splendid
bays
and
after
them
rollicked
and
swayed
with
a
perfect
delirium
of
wheels
and
springs
the
great
black
and
yellow
bodied
vehicle
like
a
huge
buzzing
back
with
its
spoil
of
a
june
day
to
the
hive
the
june
sunset
was
golden
and
rosy
upon
the
hills
and
cliffs
and
giant
cairn
stood
burnished
against
the
eastern
blue
gay
companies
scattered
about
piazzas
and
greenswards
stopped
in
their
talk
or
their
promenades
or
their

been

since

all
the
farther

of
the
wing
downstairs

the
solitary

better
of

and
why
not

graywacke
said
jeannie
hadden
is
that
a
name
it
sounds
like
the
side
of
a
mountain
and
acts
like
one
rejoined
sin
saxon
wo
budge
but
it
is
her
name
exactly
only
saxon
for
craydocke
suggestive
of
obstinacy
and
the
old
silurian
an
ancient
maiden
who
infests
our
half
the
wing
got
all
the
rooms
but
hers
and
we
bound
to
get
her
out

years
in

spot

in
with

and

and
it
she
started
besides

i
got
manifest
destiny
on
my
side
ai
i
a
saxon
sin
saxon
tossed
up
a
merry
bewitching
saucy
glance
out
of
her
blue
starlike
eyes
that
shone
under
a
fair
low
brow
touched
and
crowned
lightly
with
the
soft
haze
of
locks
frizzed
into
a
delicate
mistiness
after
the
ruling
fashion
of
the
hour
what
a
pretty
thing
she
is
said
linceford
when
seeing
her
busy
with
her
boxes
and
the
master
of
the
house
approaching
to
show
the
new
arrivals
to
their
rooms
sin
saxon
and
her
companions
flitted
away
as
they
had
come
with
a
few
more
sentences
of
bright
flung
back
at
parting
and
a
witty
little
minx
as
well
where
did
you
know
her
jeannie
and
what
sort
of
a
satanic
name
is
that
you
call
her
by
just
suits
such
a
mischief
does
it
short
for
asenath
it
was
always
her
she
just
finished
her
last
year
at
madam
routh
she
came
there
soon
after
we
did
it
a
party
of
the
graduates
and
some
younger
ones
left
with
madam
for
the
long
holidays
that
she
traveling
with
i
wonder
if
she
is
sick
of
her
life
though
by
this
time
fancy
those
girls
nell
with
a
whole
of
the
hotel
to
themselves
and
sin
saxon
in
the
midst
poor
in
the
midst
you
mean
said
nell
like
a
respectable
old
grimalkin
at
the
mercy
of
a
crowd
of
boys
and
a
tin
kettle
added
jeannie
laughing
i
no
doubt
she
a
very
nice
person
too
i
only
hope
if
i
come
across
her
i
may
call
her
graywacke
to
her
face
said
linceford
just
what
you
be
morally
sure
to
do
augusta
with
this
they
had
come
up
the
staircase
and
along
a
narrow
passage
leading
down
between
a
dozen
or
so
of
small
bedrooms
on
either
side
for
the
green
cottage
also
had
run
out
its
addition
of
two
stories
since
summer
guests
had
become
many
and
importunate
and
stood
now
where
three
open
doors
one
at
the
right
and
two
at
the
left
invited
their
entrance
upon
what
was
to
be
their
own
especial
territory
for
the
next
two
months
from
one
side
they
looked
up
the
river
along
the
face
of
the
great
ledges
and
caught
the
grandeur
of
washington
adams
and
madison
filling
up
the
northward
end
of
the
long
valley
the
aspect
of
the
other
was
toward
the
frowning
glooms
of
giant
cairn
close
by
and
broadened
then
down
over
the
pleasant
subsidence
of
the
southern
country
to
where
the
hills
grew
less
and
fair
small
modest
peaks
lifted
themselves
just
into
blue
height
and
nothing
more
smiling
back
with
a
contented
deference
toward
the
mightier
majesties
as
those
who
might
say
we
do
our
gentle
best
it
is
not
yours
yet
we
too
are
mountains
though
but
little
ones
from
underneath
spread
the
foreground
of
green
brilliant
intervale
with
the
river
flashing
down
between
margins
of
sand
and
pebbles
in
the
midst
here
they
put
leslie
goldthwaite
and
here
somehow
her
first
sensation
as
she
threw
back
her
blinds
to
let
in
all
the
twilight
for
her
dressing
was
a
feeling
of
half
relief
from
the
strained
awe
and
wonder
of
the
last
few
days
life
would
not
seem
so
petty
here
as
in
the
face
of
all
that
other
solemn
stateliness
there
was
a
reaction
of
respite
and
repose
and
why
not
the
great
emotions
are
not
meant
to
come
to
us
daily
in
their
unqualified
strength
god
knows
how
to
dilute
his
elixirs
for
the
soul
his
fine
impalpable
air
spread
round
the
earth
is
not
more
cunningly
mixed
from
pungent
gases
for
our
hourly
breath
than
life
itself
is
thinned
and
toned
that
we
may
receive
and
bear
it
leslie
wondered
if
it
were
wrong
that
the
high
mountain
fervor
let
itself
go
from
her
so
soon
and
easily
that
the
sweet
pleasantness
of
this
new
should
come
to
her
as
a
rest
that
the
laughter
and
frolic
of
the
schoolgirls
made
her
glad
with
such
sudden
sympathy
and
foresight
of
enjoyment
that
she
should
have
come
down
all
the
way
from
jefferson
in
jeannie
sense
and
that
she
almost
felt
it
a
comfortable
thing
herself
not
to
be
kept
always
up
in
the
clouds
sin
saxon
as
they
called
her
was
so
bright
and
odd
and
fascinating
was
there
any
harm
because
no
special
obvious
good
in
that
there
was
a
little
twinge
of
doubt
remembering
poor
miss
craydocke
but
that
had
seemed
pure
fun
not
malice
after
all
and
it
was
hearing
sin
saxon
tell
it
very
funny
she
could
imagine
the
life
they
led
the
quiet
lady
yet
if
it
were
quite
intolerable
why
did
she
remain
perhaps
after
all
she
saw
through
the
fun
of
it
and
i
think
myself
perhaps
she
did
the
marie
stuart
net
went
on
and
then
such
a
pretty
muslin
white
with
narrow
stripes
and
small
bright
leaves
dropped
over
them
as
if
its
wearer
had
stood
out
under
a
in
october
and
all
the
tiniest
and
most
radiant
bits
had
fallen
and
fastened
themselves
about
her
and
last
of
all
with
her
little
hooded
cape
of
scarlet
cashmere
over
her
arm
she
went
down
to
eat
cream
biscuit
and
wood
strawberries
for
tea
her
summer
life
began
with
a
charming
freshness
and
dainty
delight
there
were
pleasant
voices
of
happy
people
about
them
in
hall
and
open
parlor
as
they
sat
at
their
late
repast
everything
seemed
indicative
of
abundant
coming
enjoyment
and
the
girls
chatted
gayly
of
all
they
had
already
discovered
or
conjectured
and
began
to
talk
of
the
ways
of
the
place
and
the
sojourners
in
it
quite
like
old
it
was
even
more
delightful
yet
strolling
out
when
tea
was
over
and
meeting
the
routh
party
again
half
way
between
the
cottage
and
the
hotel
and
sauntering
on
with
them
insensibly
till
they
found
themselves
on
the
wide
upon
which
opened
the
garden
bedrooms
and
being
persuaded
after
all
to
sit
down
since
they
had
got
there
though
linceford
had
demurred
at
a
too
hasty
rushing
over
as
new
comers
to
begin
visits
oh
nobody
knows
when
they
called
upon
here
or
who
comes
first
said
mattie
shannon
we
generally
receive
half
way
across
the
green
and
it
a
chance
which
turns
back
or
whether
we
get
near
either
house
again
or
not
houses
do
signify
except
when
it
rains
but
it
just
signifies
that
you
should
see
how
magnificently
we
have
settled
ourselves
for
nights
and
dressing
and
when
it
rain
said
sin
saxon
throwing
back
a
door
behind
her
that
stood
a
little
ajar
it
opened
directly
into
a
small
apartment
half
parlor
and
half
from
which
doors
showed
others
on
either
side
furnished
as
it
was
maud
walcott
between
the
arnalls
and
mine
but
what
with
our
trunks
and
our
beds
and
our
crinolines
and
our
we
wanted
a
bowditch
navigator
to
steer
clear
of
the
reefs
and
something
was
always
getting
knocked
over
so
one
night
we
were
seized
simultaneously
with
an
idea
we
make
a
boudoir
of
this
for
the
general
good
and
forthwith
we
fell
upon
the
bed
and
amongst
us
got
it
down
it
was
the
greatest
fun
we
carried
the
pieces
and
the
mattresses
all
off
ourselves
up
to
the
attic
after
ten
and
we
gave
the
chambermaid
a
dollar
next
morning
and
nobody
been
the
wiser
since
and
then
we
walked
to
the
upper
village
and
bought
that
extraordinary
chintz
and
frilled
and
cushioned
our
trunks
into
ottomans
and
curtained
the
and
lucinda
got
us
a
and
maud
came
in
with
me
to
sleep
and
we
kept
our
extra
pillows
and
we
should
be
comfortable
as
queens
if
it
was
for
graywacke
now
sin
saxon
you
know
graywacke
is
just
the
life
of
the
house
what
would
such
a
parcel
of
us
do
if
we
had
something
to
run
upon
only
i
afraid
i
shall
get
tired
of
it
at
last
she
bears
it
so
it
is
exactly
saintliness
nor
graywackeiness
but
it
seems
sometimes
as
if
she
took
a
quiet
kind
of
fun
out
of
it
herself
as
if
she
were
somehow
laughing
at
us
after
all
in
her
sleeve
and
if
she
is
got
the
biggest
end
bright
enough
do
we
her
within
an
inch
of
her
life
though
when
we
come
home
in
the
wagons
at
night
i
should
think
she
could
stand
that
long
i
guess
she
wants
all
her
and
kate
arnall
can
equal
to
tennyson
himself
or
any
great
white
owl
yes
but
what
do
you
think
as
true
as
i
live
i
heard
her
answer
back
the
other
night
with
such
a
sly
little
she
did
she
did
i
thought
at
first
it
actually
came
from
the
great
oh
been
a
girl
once
you
may
depend
and
has
more
than
half
got
over
it
either
but
wait
till
we
have
our
what
a
howl
was
superlative
to
and
other
divertisements
did
not
appear
at
this
time
for
a
young
man
did
approaching
from
the
front
of
the
hotel
and
came
up
to
the
group
on
the
piazza
with
the
question
at
what
time
do
we
set
off
for
oh
early
scherman
by
nine
earlier
than
you
be
ready
said
frank
scherman
sister
one
of
the
routh
girls
also
i
sha
have
any
crimps
to
take
down
that
one
thing
frank
answered
and
sin
saxon
glancing
at
his
handsome
waving
hair
whispered
saucily
to
jeannie
hadden
i
do
more
than
half
believe
that
either
then
aloud
you
must
join
the
party
too
girls
by
the
way
it
one
of
the
nicest
excursions
here
we
got
two
wagons
and
they
be
full
but
there
holden
red
will
take
six
and
i
do
believe
anybody
has
spoken
for
it
scherman
would
it
make
you
happy
to
go
and
see
most
intensely
and
frank
scherman
bowed
a
low
graceful
bow
settling
back
into
his
first
attitude
however
as
one
who
could
quite
willingly
resign
himself
to
his
present
comparative
unhappiness
awhile
longer
where
is
asked
leslie
goldthwaite
it
the
mountain
you
see
there
peeping
round
the
shoulder
of
cairn
a
comfortable
little
rudiment
of
a
mountain
just
enough
for
a
in
climbing
do
you
see
how
the
crest
drops
over
on
one
side
and
that
scrap
of
pine
which
is
really
a
huge
gaunt
thing
a
hundred
years
old
slants
out
from
it
with
just
a
tuft
of
green
at
the
very
tip
like
an
old
feather
stuck
in
jauntily
and
the
pine
woods
round
the
foot
of
the
cairn
are
lovely
said
maud
oh
cried
leslie
drawing
a
long
breath
as
if
their
spicy
smell
were
already
about
her
there
is
nothing
i
delight
in
so
as
pines
you
have
your
fill
then
for
it
ten
miles
through
nothing
else
and
the
road
is
like
a
carpet
with
the
soft
brown
needles
i
hope
augusta
wo
be
too
tired
to
feel
like
going
said
elinor
we
had
better
ask
her
soon
then
she
is
looking
this
way
now
we
ought
to
go
sin
we
got
all
our
settling
to
do
for
the
night
we
walk
over
with
you
said
sin
saxon
then
we
shall
have
done
up
all
the
preliminaries
nicely
we
called
on
you
before
you
were
off
the
you
returned
it
and
now
we
pay
up
and
leave
you
owing
us
one
come
scherman
you
be
so
far
on
your
way
to
holden
and
perhaps
inertia
will
carry
you
through
but
a
little
girl
presently
appeared
running
from
the
hotel
portico
at
the
front
as
they
came
round
to
view
from
thence
madam
routh
was
sitting
in
the
open
hall
with
some
newly
arrived
friends
and
sent
one
of
her
lambs
as
sin
called
them
to
say
to
the
older
girls
that
she
preferred
they
should
not
go
away
again
seize
thee
routh
less
king
quoted
sin
saxon
with
an
absurd
air
of
declamation
was
ever
thus
from
childhood
hour
and
now
just
as
we
thought
childhood
hour
was
comfortably
over
that
the
clock
had
struck
one
and
down
we
might
run
hickory
dickory
dock
behold
the
lengthened
sweetness
long
drawn
out
of
school
rule
in
vacation
even
before
the
very
face
and
eyes
of
freedom
on
her
mountain
heights
well
we
must
go
i
suppose
scherman
you
have
to
represent
us
to
linceford
and
persuade
her
to
join
us
to
and
be
sure
you
get
the
red
it
be
all
the
worse
for
graywacke
if
we
kept
in
and
sent
off
early
she
continued
to
her
companions
as
they
turned
away
my
what
that
boy
got
chapter
viii
sixteen
and
sixty
after
all
this
i
wonder
if
you
would
just
like
to
look
in
at
miss
craydocke
room
with
me
who
can
give
you
a
pass
anywhere
within
the
geography
of
my
story
she
came
in
here
with
the
lath
and
plaster
as
sin
saxon
had
said
she
had
gathered
little
comforts
and
embellishments
about
her
from
summer
to
summer
until
the
room
had
a
and
even
a
look
of
luxury
contrasted
with
the
bare
dormitories
around
it
over
the
straw
matting
that
soon
grows
shabby
in
a
hotel
she
had
laid
a
large
square
of
soft
green
carpet
in
a
little
mossy
pattern
that
covered
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
was
held
tidily
in
place
by
a
foot
of
the
bedstead
and
two
forward
ones
each
of
the
table
and
washstand
on
this
little
green
stood
her
shaker
and
a
round
with
her
and
a
few
books
against
the
wall
hung
some
shelves
with
more
books
quite
a
little
circulating
library
they
were
for
invalids
and
people
who
came
to
the
mountains
like
foolish
virgins
with
scant
supply
of
the
oil
of
literature
for
the
feeding
of
their
besides
these
there
were
engravings
and
photographs
in
frames
that
journeyed
with
her
safely
in
the
bottoms
of
her
trunks
also
the
wall
itself
had
been
papered
at
her
own
cost
and
providing
with
a
pretty
hanging
and
there
were
striped
muslin
curtains
to
the
window
over
which
were
caught
the
sprays
of
some
light
wandering
vine
that
sprung
from
a
vase
between
she
had
everything
pretty
about
her
this
old
miss
craydocke
how
many
people
do
that
have
not
a
bit
of
outward
prettiness
themselves
not
one
cubit
to
the
stature
not
one
hair
white
or
black
can
they
add
or
change
and
around
them
grow
the
lilies
in
the
glory
of
solomon
and
a
frosted
leaf
or
a
mossy
twig
that
they
can
pick
up
from
under
their
feet
and
bring
home
from
the
commonest
walk
comes
in
with
them
bearing
a
brightness
and
a
grace
that
seems
sometimes
almost
like
a
satire
but
in
the
midst
grows
silently
the
of
the
soul
absorbing
to
itself
hourly
that
which
feeds
the
beauty
of
the
lily
and
the
radiance
of
the
leaf
waiting
only
for
the
hundred
years
of
its
shrouding
to
be
over
miss
craydocke
never
came
in
from
the
woods
and
rocks
without
her
trophies
rare
lovely
mosses
and
bits
of
most
delicate
ferns
maidenhair
and
tiny
trails
of
wintergreen
and
arbutus
filled
a
great
shallow
indian
china
dish
upon
her
bureau
top
and
grew
in
their
fairy
fashion
in
the
clear
soft
water
she
kept
them
freshened
with
shining
scraps
of
mountain
minerals
garnets
and
quartz
and
beryls
heaped
artistically
rather
than
scientifically
on
a
base
of
jasper
and
malachite
and
dark
basalt
and
glistening
spar
and
curious
fossils
these
not
gathered
by
any
means
in
a
single
summer
or
in
ordinary
ramblings
but
treasured
long
and
standing
some
of
them
for
friendly
memories
balanced
on
the
one
side
a
like
grouping
of
shells
and
corals
and
on
the
other
upon
a
broad
put
up
over
a
little
corner
fireplace
for
miss
craydocke
room
joining
the
main
house
took
the
benefit
of
one
of
its
old
chimneys
above
or
about
the
pictures
lay
mossy
gnarled
and
twisted
branches
gray
and
green
framing
them
in
a
forest
arabesque
and
great
pine
cones
pendent
from
their
boughs
crowned
and
canopied
the
mirror
what
you
keep
your
kindling
wood
up
there
for
sin
saxon
had
asked
with
a
grave
puzzled
face
coming
in
for
pure
mischief
on
one
of
her
frequent
and
ingenious
errands
why
where
should
i
put
a
pile
of
wood
or
a
basket
there
no
room
for
things
to
lie
round
here
you
have
to
hang
everything
up
was
miss
craydocke
answer
quick
as
a
flash
her
eyes
twinkling
comically
with
appreciation
of
the
fun
and
sin
saxon
had
gone
away
and
told
the
girls
that
the
old
lady
knew
how
to
feather
her
nest
better
than
any
of
them
and
was
sharp
enough
at
a
peck
too
upon
occasion
she
found
her
again
one
morning
sitting
in
the
midst
of
a
pile
of
homespun
which
she
was
cutting
up
with
great
shears
into
boys
blouses
there
that
the
noise
that
has
disturbed
me
so
cried
the
girl
i
thought
it
was
a
or
a
or
that
you
had
got
the
asthma
awfully
i
could
write
my
letter
for
listening
to
it
and
came
round
to
ask
what
the
matter
miss
craydocke
i
do
see
why
you
keep
the
door
bolted
on
your
side
it
is
any
more
fair
for
you
than
for
me
and
i
sure
i
do
all
the
visiting
besides
dangerous
what
if
anything
should
happen
in
the
night
i
could
get
in
to
help
you
or
there
might
be
a
fire
in
our
room
i
sure
i
expect
nothing
else
we
boiled
eggs
in
the
etna
the
other
night
and
got
too
much
alcohol
in
the
saucer
and
then
in
the
midst
of
the
blaze
and
excitement
what
should
madam
routh
do
but
come
knocking
at
the
door
of
course
we
had
to
put
it
in
the
closet
and
there
were
all
our
muslin
dresses
that
were
hanging
on
the
hooks
in
maud
room
i
assure
you
i
felt
like
the
man
sitting
on
the
standing
with
my
back
against
the
door
and
my
clothes
spread
out
for
fear
she
would
see
the
flash
under
the
crack
for
we
nothing
else
but
moonlight
in
the
but
now
tell
me
please
what
are
all
these
things
do
you
really
want
to
know
of
course
i
do
now
that
i
got
over
my
fright
about
your
strangling
with
the
asthma
those
shears
did
wheeze
so
my
curiosity
is
all
alive
again
i
a
cousin
down
in
north
carolina
teaching
the
little
freedmen
and
she
to
have
all
these
sacks
to
tie
the
naughty
ones
up
in
what
a
bright
idea
and
then
to
whip
them
with
rods
as
the
giant
did
his
crockery
i
suppose
or
perhaps
they
ca
be
petticoats
wo
she
be
warm
though
may
be
if
you
were
to
take
one
and
sew
up
the
seams
you
would
be
able
to
satisfy
yourself
i
why
i
never
put
anything
together
i
tried
once
with
a
pair
of
hospital
drawers
and
they
were
like
sam
hyde
dog
that
got
cut
in
two
and
clapped
together
again
in
a
hurry
two
legs
up
and
two
legs
down
miss
craydocke
why
do
go
down
among
the
freedmen
you
have
half
a
sphere
up
here
nothing
but
hobbs
location
and
the
little
hoskinses
i
ca
organize
and
execute
letitia
can
it
her
gift
i
ca
do
great
things
i
can
only
just
carry
round
my
little
cup
of
cold
water
but
it
gets
so
dreadfully
joggled
in
such
a
place
as
this
do
we
girls
disturb
you
miss
craydocke
i
should
think
you
be
quieter
in
the
other
wing
or
upstairs
young
folks
are
apt
to
think
that
old
folks
ought
to
go
a
story
higher
but
we
content
and
they
must
put
up
with
us
until
the
proprietor
orders
a
move
well
but
if
ever
you
do
smell
smoke
in
the
night
you
draw
your
bolt
the
first
thing
wo
you
this
evening
upon
which
we
have
offered
you
your
pass
reader
miss
craydocke
is
sitting
with
her
mosquito
bar
up
and
her
candle
alight
finishing
some
pretty
thing
that
daylight
has
not
been
long
enough
for
a
flag
basket
at
her
feet
holds
strips
and
rolls
of
delicate
carefully
split
into
filmy
thinness
and
heaps
of
and
those
thick
and
crisp
with
clustering
brown
spires
as
well
as
sheets
of
lichen
silvery
and
pale
green
and
on
the
across
her
knees
lies
her
work
a
graceful
cross
in
perspective
put
on
in
birch
shaded
from
faint
buff
to
bistre
dashed
with
the
detached
lines
that
seem
to
have
quilted
the
together
around
the
foot
of
the
cross
rises
a
mound
of
lovely
in
relief
with
feathery
filaments
creeping
up
and
wreathing
about
the
shaft
and
miss
craydocke
is
just
dotting
in
some
bits
of
slender
stems
among
little
brown
mushrooms
and
chalices
as
there
comes
a
sudden
imperative
knocking
at
the
door
of
communication
or
defense
between
her
and
sin
saxon
you
must
just
open
this
time
if
you
please
i
got
my
arms
full
and
i
could
come
round
miss
craydocke
slipped
her
work
and
all
under
her
bureau
upon
the
floor
for
safety
and
then
with
her
quaint
queer
expression
in
which
curiosity
pluckiness
and
a
foretaste
of
amusement
mingled
so
as
to
drive
out
annoyance
pushed
back
her
bolt
and
presented
herself
to
the
demand
of
her
visitor
much
as
an
undaunted
man
might
fling
open
his
door
at
the
call
of
a
mob
sin
saxon
stood
there
in
the
light
of
the
good
lady
candle
making
a
pretty
picture
against
the
dim
background
of
the
unlighted
room
beyond
her
fair
hair
was
tossed
and
her
cheeks
flushed
her
blue
eyes
bright
with
sauciness
and
fun
in
her
hands
or
across
her
arms
rather
she
held
some
huge
uncouth
thing
that
was
not
to
the
last
degree
either
something
conglomerated
rudely
upon
a
great
crooked
log
or
branch
which
glanced
at
closer
proved
to
be
a
fragment
of
gray
old
pine
sticks
and
roots
and
bark
straw
and
grass
and
locks
of
dirty
made
up
its
bulk
and
its
untidiness
and
this
thing
sin
held
out
with
glee
declaring
she
had
brought
a
real
treasure
to
add
to
miss
craydocke
collection
such
a
chance
she
said
coming
in
one
might
have
another
in
a
dozen
years
i
have
just
given
jimmy
wigley
a
quarter
for
it
and
just
all
but
broken
his
neck
to
get
it
it
a
real
crow
nest
corvinus
i
suppose
where
will
you
have
it
i
going
to
nail
it
up
for
you
myself
wo
it
make
a
nice
contrast
to
the
over
the
bed
shall
i
but
then
if
it
drop
down
on
your
nose
you
know
i
think
the
corner
over
the
fireplace
will
be
best
yes
we
have
it
right
up
perpendicular
in
the
angle
the
branch
twists
a
little
you
see
and
the
nest
will
run
out
with
its
odds
and
ends
like
an
old
banner
might
i
push
up
the
washstand
to
get
on
to
suppose
you
lay
it
the
fireplace
it
will
just
rest
nicely
across
those
evergreen
boughs
and
be
in
the
current
of
ventilation
outward
well
that
an
idea
to
be
miss
craydocke
sin
saxon
says
this
in
a
sudden
interjectional
way
as
if
it
were
with
some
quite
fresh
idea
i
certain
you
play
chess
you
mistaken
i
do
you
would
then
by
intuition
your
are
so
triumphant
why
it
really
an
ornament
with
a
little
stress
and
strain
that
made
her
words
interjectional
she
had
got
it
into
place
thrusting
one
end
up
the
throat
of
the
chimney
and
lodging
the
crotch
that
held
the
nest
upon
the
stems
of
fresh
pine
that
lay
across
the
andirons
and
the
odds
and
ends
in
safe
position
and
suggesting
neither
harm
nor
unsuitableness
looked
unique
and
curious
and
not
so
ugly
it
really
an
ornament
repeated
sin
shaking
the
dust
off
her
dress
as
you
expected
of
course
replied
miss
craydocke
well
i
was
not
to
say
confident
i
was
afraid
it
might
be
much
but
scientific
but
now
if
you
do
forget
and
light
a
fire
under
it
some
day
miss
craydocke
i
sha
forget
and
i
very
much
obliged
really
perhaps
by
and
by
i
shall
put
it
in
a
rough
box
and
send
it
to
a
nephew
of
mine
with
some
other
things
for
his
collection
goodness
miss
craydocke
they
wo
express
it
they
think
it
an
infernal
machine
or
a
murder
but
it
disposed
of
for
the
present
anyway
the
truth
was
you
know
cents
is
a
kind
of
cup
of
cold
water
to
jimmy
wigley
and
then
there
was
the
fun
of
bringing
it
in
and
i
did
know
anybody
but
you
to
offer
it
to
i
so
glad
you
like
it
the
girls
thought
you
would
perhaps
i
can
get
you
another
or
something
else
as
curious
some
day
a
moose
horns
or
a
there
no
knowing
but
now
apropos
of
the
nest
i
a
crow
to
with
you
you
gave
me
horrible
dreams
all
night
the
last
time
i
came
to
see
you
i
do
know
whether
it
was
your
little
or
miss
letitia
organizing
and
executive
genius
or
the
cup
of
cold
water
you
spoke
of
or
it
just
occurred
to
me
the
fuss
i
had
over
my
waterfall
that
day
trying
to
make
it
into
a
melon
but
i
had
the
most
extraordinary
time
endeavoring
to
pay
you
a
visit
down
south
it
was
and
there
you
were
organizing
and
executing
after
all
on
the
most
tremendous
scale
some
kind
of
freedmen
institution
you
were
explaining
to
me
and
showing
me
all
sorts
of
things
in
such
enormous
bulk
and
extent
and
number
first
i
was
to
see
your
stables
where
the
cows
were
kept
a
trillion
of
cows
that
was
what
you
told
me
and
on
the
way
we
went
down
among
such
whole
forests
cut
up
into
kindlings
and
built
into
solid
walls
that
reached
up
till
the
sky
looked
like
a
thread
of
blue
between
and
presently
we
came
to
a
kind
of
opening
and
turned
off
to
see
the
laundry
lisphin
had
just
brought
home
my
things
at
bedtime
and
was
a
place
to
do
the
world
washing
in
or
bleach
out
all
the
ethiopians
tubs
like
the
hold
of
the
great
eastern
and
spouts
coming
into
them
like
the
staubbach
like
a
of
telegraphs
fields
like
prairies
as
far
as
you
could
see
with
things
laid
out
to
whiten
and
suddenly
we
came
to
what
was
like
a
pond
of
milk
with
crowds
of
negro
women
stirring
it
with
long
poles
and
all
at
once
something
came
roaring
behind
and
you
called
to
me
to
jump
aside
that
the
hot
water
was
let
on
to
make
the
starch
and
down
it
rushed
a
cataract
like
niagara
in
clouds
of
steam
and
then
well
it
changed
to
something
else
i
suppose
but
it
was
after
that
fashion
all
night
long
and
the
last
i
remember
i
was
trying
to
climb
up
the
cairn
with
a
cup
of
cold
water
set
on
atilt
at
the
crown
of
my
head
which
i
was
to
get
to
the
sky
parlor
without
spilling
a
drop
nobody
brain
but
yours
would
have
put
it
together
like
that
said
miss
craydocke
laughing
till
she
had
to
feel
for
her
to
wipe
away
the
tears
do
cry
miss
craydocke
said
sin
saxon
changing
suddenly
to
the
most
touching
tone
and
expression
of
regretful
concern
i
did
mean
to
distress
you
i
do
think
anything
is
really
the
matter
with
my
brain
but
i
tell
you
what
it
is
she
went
on
presently
in
her
old
manner
i
in
a
dreadful
way
with
that
waterfall
and
i
wish
lend
me
one
of
your
caps
or
advise
me
what
to
do
it
an
awful
thing
when
the
fashion
alters
just
as
you
got
used
to
the
last
one
you
ca
go
back
and
you
do
dare
to
go
forward
i
wish
hair
was
like
noses
born
in
a
shape
without
giving
you
any
responsibility
but
we
do
have
to
finish
ourselves
and
that
just
what
makes
us
restless
you
have
come
to
the
worst
yet
said
miss
craydocke
significantly
what
do
you
mean
what
is
the
worst
will
it
come
all
at
once
or
will
it
be
broken
to
me
it
will
be
broken
and
the
worst
one
of
these
years
find
a
little
thin
spot
coming
may
be
and
spreading
over
your
forehead
or
on
the
top
of
your
head
and
it
be
the
fashion
to
comb
the
hair
just
so
as
to
show
it
off
and
make
it
worse
and
for
a
while
that
be
your
thorn
in
the
flesh
and
then
you
begin
to
wonder
why
the
color
is
so
bright
as
it
used
to
be
but
looks
dingy
all
you
can
do
to
it
and
again
after
a
while
some
day
in
a
strong
light
see
there
are
white
threads
in
it
and
the
rest
is
fading
and
so
by
degrees
and
the
degrees
all
separate
pains
you
have
to
come
to
it
and
give
up
the
crown
of
your
youth
and
take
to
scraps
of
lace
and
muslin
or
a
front
as
i
did
a
dozen
years
ago
sin
saxon
had
no
sauciness
to
give
back
for
that
it
made
her
feel
all
at
once
that
this
old
miss
craydocke
had
really
been
a
girl
too
with
golden
hair
like
her
own
perhaps
and
not
so
very
far
in
the
past
either
but
that
a
like
space
in
her
own
future
could
picture
itself
to
her
mind
and
something
quite
different
in
her
mood
from
ordinary
made
her
say
with
even
an
unconscious
touch
of
reverence
in
her
voice
i
wonder
if
i
shall
bear
it
when
it
comes
as
well
as
you
there
a
recompense
said
miss
craydocke
you
have
got
it
all
then
you
know
there
never
a
fifty
or
a
sixty
years
that
hold
the
tens
and
the
twenties
i
found
out
something
said
sin
saxon
as
she
came
back
to
the
girls
again
a
dinner
argues
a
fresh
one
some
time
you
have
cold
roast
mutton
unless
it
has
once
been
hot
and
never
a
word
more
would
she
say
to
explain
herself
chapter
ix
i
do
see
why
the
little
red
was
at
the
door
of
the
green
cottage
frank
scherman
had
got
the
refusal
of
it
the
night
before
and
early
in
the
morning
madam
routh
compliments
had
come
to
linceford
with
the
request
in
all
the
form
that
mountain
usage
demanded
that
she
and
the
young
ladies
would
make
part
of
the
expedition
for
the
day
captain
jotham
green
host
and
proprietor
himself
stood
at
the
heads
the
green
cottage
you
perceive
had
double
right
to
its
appellation
it
was
both
baptismal
and
hereditary
surname
and
given
name
given
with
a
coat
of
fresh
pale
paint
that
had
been
laid
on
it
within
the
year
and
had
communicated
a
certain
tender
expression
to
the
old
centre
and
its
outshoots
green
within
was
generously
busy
with
biscuits
cold
chicken
doughnuts
fried
since
sunrise
and
coffee
richly
compounded
with
cream
and
sugar
which
a
great
tin
can
stood
waiting
to
receive
and
convey
and
which
was
at
length
to
serve
as
cooking
utensil
in
reheating
upon
the
fire
of
coals
the
picnickers
would
make
up
under
the
very
tassel
of
the
great
wagons
were
drawn
up
also
before
the
piazza
of
the
hotel
and
between
the
two
houses
flitted
the
excursionists
full
of
the
bright
enthusiasm
of
the
setting
off
which
is
the
best
part
of
a
jaunt
invariably
leslie
goldthwaite
in
the
hamadryad
costume
just
aware
which
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
help
of
its
exceeding
prettiness
and
of
glances
that
recognized
it
pleased
with
a
mixture
of
pleasures
was
on
the
surface
of
things
once
more
taking
the
delight
of
the
moment
with
a
young
girl
innocent
abandonment
it
was
nice
to
be
received
so
among
all
these
new
companions
to
be
evidently
though
tacitly
nice
in
the
way
girls
have
of
doing
it
to
be
launched
at
once
into
the
beginning
of
apparently
exhaustless
delights
all
this
was
superadded
to
the
first
and
underlying
joy
of
merely
being
alive
and
breathing
this
superb
summer
morning
among
these
forests
and
hills
sin
saxon
whatever
new
feeling
of
half
sympathy
and
respect
had
been
touched
in
her
toward
miss
craydocke
the
night
before
in
her
morning
mood
was
all
alive
again
to
mischief
the
small
spare
figure
of
the
lady
appeared
at
the
coming
out
briskly
toward
them
along
the
passage
just
as
the
second
wagon
filled
up
and
was
ready
to
move
i
did
not
describe
miss
craydocke
herself
when
i
gave
you
the
glimpse
into
her
room
there
was
not
much
to
describe
and
i
forgot
it
in
dwelling
upon
her
surroundings
and
occupations
in
fact
she
extended
herself
into
these
and
made
you
take
them
involuntarily
and
largely
into
the
account
in
your
apprehension
of
her
some
people
seem
to
have
given
them
at
the
outset
a
mere
germ
of
personality
like
this
which
must
needs
widen
itself
out
in
like
fashion
to
be
felt
at
all
her
mosses
and
minerals
her
pressed
leaves
and
flowers
her
odds
and
ends
of
art
and
science
and
prettiness
which
she
gathered
about
her
her
industries
and
benevolences
these
were
herself
out
of
these
she
was
only
a
little
elderly
of
a
woman
of
no
apparent
account
among
crowds
of
other
people
and
with
scarcely
enough
of
bodily
bulk
or
presence
to
take
any
positive
foothold
anywhere
what
she
might
have
seemed
in
the
days
when
her
hair
was
golden
and
her
little
figure
plump
and
the
very
unclassical
features
rounded
and
rosy
with
the
bloom
and
grace
of
youth
was
perhaps
another
thing
but
now
with
her
undeniable
front
and
cheeks
straightened
into
lines
that
gave
you
the
idea
of
her
having
slept
all
night
upon
both
of
them
and
got
them
into
longitudinal
wrinkles
that
all
day
was
never
able
to
wear
out
above
all
with
her
curious
little
nose
that
was
the
exact
expression
of
it
sharply
and
suddenly
thrusting
itself
among
things
in
general
from
the
middle
plane
of
her
face
with
slight
preparatory
hint
of
its
intention
you
would
scarcely
charge
her
upon
suspicion
with
any
embezzlement
or
making
away
of
charms
intrusted
to
her
keeping
in
the
time
gone
by
this
morning
moreover
she
had
somehow
given
herself
a
scratch
upon
the
tip
of
this
odd
investigating
member
and
it
blushed
for
its
inquisitiveness
under
a
scrap
of
thin
pink
adhesive
plaster
sin
saxon
caught
sight
of
her
as
she
came
little
miss
netticoat
she
cried
just
under
her
breath
a
fresh
petticoat
a
red
nose
then
changing
her
tone
with
her
quotation
modest
flower
met
me
in
a
luckless
hour
thou
always
dost
what
thou
gone
and
got
thyself
up
so
for
just
as
i
was
almost
persuaded
to
be
good
now
i
help
that
and
she
dropped
her
folded
hands
in
her
lap
exhaled
a
little
sigh
of
vanquished
goodness
and
looked
round
appealingly
to
her
companions
it
only
said
miss
craydocke
reaching
them
a
trifle
out
of
breath
this
little
parcel
something
i
promised
to
prissy
hoskins
and
you
just
go
round
by
the
cliff
and
leave
it
for
me
oh
i
afraid
of
the
cliff
cried
florrie
arnall
creggin
horses
backed
there
the
other
day
it
horribly
dangerous
it
three
quarters
of
a
mile
round
suggested
the
driver
the
red
might
take
it
they
go
faster
than
we
or
can
if
they
try
said
mattie
shannon
the
red
just
ready
said
sin
saxon
you
need
laugh
that
was
a
pun
but
oh
miss
craydocke
and
her
tone
suggested
the
mischievous
apropos
what
you
have
been
doing
to
your
nose
oh
yes
miss
craydocke
had
a
way
of
saying
oh
yes
it
was
my
knife
slipped
as
i
was
cutting
a
bit
of
cord
in
a
silly
fashion
up
toward
my
face
it
a
mercy
my
nose
served
to
save
my
eyes
i
suppose
that
partly
what
noses
are
for
said
sin
saxon
gravely
especially
when
you
follow
them
and
it
blind
it
was
a
piece
of
good
luck
too
after
all
said
miss
craydocke
in
her
simple
way
never
knowing
or
choosing
to
know
that
she
was
snubbed
or
quizzed
looking
for
a
bit
of
plaster
i
found
my
little
parcel
of
tragacanth
that
i
wanted
so
the
other
day
it
queer
how
things
turn
up
excessively
queer
said
sin
solemnly
still
looking
at
the
injured
feature
but
as
you
say
it
all
for
the
best
after
all
a
divinity
that
shapes
our
ends
them
how
we
will
hiram
we
might
as
well
drive
on
i
take
the
parcel
miss
craydocke
we
get
it
there
somehow
going
or
coming
the
wagon
rolled
off
veils
and
feathers
taking
the
wind
bravely
and
making
a
gay
moving
picture
against
the
dark
pines
and
gray
ledges
as
it
glanced
along
sin
saxon
tossed
miss
craydocke
parcel
into
the
little
red
as
they
passed
it
by
taking
the
road
in
advance
giving
a
saucy
word
of
command
to
jim
holden
which
transferred
the
charge
of
its
delivery
to
him
and
calling
out
a
hurried
explanation
to
the
ladies
over
her
shoulder
that
it
would
take
them
round
the
cliff
the
most
wonderful
point
in
all
outledge
up
and
down
the
whole
length
of
new
hampshire
they
could
see
from
there
if
their
eyes
were
good
enough
and
so
they
were
away
miss
craydocke
turned
back
into
the
house
not
a
whit
discomfited
and
with
not
so
much
as
a
contrasting
sigh
in
her
bosom
or
a
rankle
in
her
heart
on
the
contrary
a
droll
twinkle
played
among
the
at
the
corners
of
her
eyes
they
could
not
hurt
her
these
merry
girls
meaning
nothing
but
the
moment
fun
nor
cheat
her
of
her
quiet
share
of
the
fun
either
up
above
out
of
a
window
over
the
piazza
roof
looked
two
others
young
girls
one
of
them
at
least
also
upon
the
scene
of
the
i
can
not
help
it
that
a
good
many
different
people
will
get
into
my
short
story
they
get
into
a
short
time
in
such
a
summer
holiday
and
so
why
not
at
any
rate
i
must
tell
you
about
these
josselyns
these
two
had
never
in
all
their
lives
been
away
pleasuring
before
they
had
nobody
but
each
other
to
come
with
now
susan
had
been
away
a
good
deal
in
the
last
two
years
but
it
had
not
been
pleasuring
martha
was
some
five
or
six
years
the
younger
she
had
a
pretty
face
yet
marked
as
it
is
so
sad
to
see
the
faces
of
the
young
with
lines
and
loss
lines
that
tell
of
cares
too
early
felt
and
loss
of
the
first
fresh
redundant
bloom
that
such
lines
bring
they
sat
a
great
deal
at
this
window
of
theirs
it
was
a
sort
of
instinct
and
habit
with
them
and
it
made
them
happier
than
almost
anything
else
sitting
at
a
window
together
it
was
home
to
them
because
at
home
they
lived
so
life
and
duty
were
so
framed
in
for
them
in
one
dear
old
sometimes
they
thought
that
it
would
he
heaven
to
them
by
and
by
that
such
a
seat
and
such
a
quiet
happy
outlook
they
should
find
kept
for
them
together
in
the
mansion
up
above
at
home
it
was
up
three
flights
of
stairs
in
a
tall
narrow
city
house
of
which
the
lower
floors
overflowed
with
young
boisterous
half
brothers
and
sisters
the
tide
not
seldom
rising
and
inundating
their
own
retreat
whose
delicate
mother
not
more
than
eight
years
older
than
her
eldest
was
tied
hand
and
foot
to
her
nursery
with
a
baby
on
her
lap
and
the
two
or
three
next
above
with
hands
always
to
be
washed
disputes
and
amusements
always
to
be
settled
small
morals
to
be
enforced
and
clean
calico
tiers
to
be
incessantly
put
on
and
susan
and
martha
sat
upstairs
and
made
the
tiers
josselyn
was
a
with
a
salary
of
eighteen
hundred
dollars
and
these
seven
children
and
susan
and
martha
were
girls
of
fair
culture
and
womanly
tastes
and
social
longings
how
does
this
seem
to
you
young
ladies
and
what
do
you
think
of
their
upstairs
life
together
you
who
calculate
if
you
calculate
at
all
whether
five
hundred
dollars
may
carry
you
respectably
through
your
city
assemblies
where
you
shine
in
silk
and
gossamer
of
which
there
will
not
be
a
dress
in
the
room
that
cost
less
than
dollars
and
come
home
after
the
dance
a
perfect
rag
two
years
ago
when
you
were
perhaps
performing
in
tableaux
for
the
benefit
of
the
sanitary
these
two
girls
had
felt
the
great
enthusiasm
of
the
time
lay
hold
of
them
in
a
larger
way
susan
had
a
friend
a
dear
old
intimate
of
now
a
staid
woman
of
who
was
to
go
out
in
yet
maturer
companionship
into
the
hospitals
and
susan
heart
burned
to
go
but
there
were
all
the
little
tiers
and
the
abc
and
the
faces
and
fingers
i
can
do
it
for
a
while
said
martha
without
you
those
two
words
held
the
sacrifice
mamma
is
so
nicely
this
summer
and
by
and
by
aunt
lucy
may
come
perhaps
i
can
do
well
so
martha
sat
for
months
and
months
in
the
upstairs
window
alone
there
were
martial
marchings
in
the
streets
beneath
great
guns
thundered
out
rejoicings
flags
filled
the
air
with
crimson
and
blue
like
an
aurora
she
only
sat
and
made
little
frocks
and
tiers
for
the
brothers
and
sisters
god
knew
how
every
patient
needle
thrust
was
really
also
a
woman
blow
for
her
country
and
now
pale
and
thin
with
close
lonely
work
the
time
had
come
to
her
at
last
when
it
was
right
to
take
a
respite
when
everybody
said
it
must
be
when
uncle
david
just
home
from
japan
had
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
three
new
bills
and
said
to
them
in
his
rough
way
there
girls
take
that
and
go
your
lengths
the
war
was
over
and
among
all
the
rest
here
were
these
two
honorably
discharged
and
resting
after
the
fight
but
nobody
at
outledge
knew
anything
of
the
story
there
is
almost
always
at
every
summer
sojourn
some
party
of
persons
who
are
to
the
rest
what
the
is
to
the
stream
who
gather
to
themselves
and
bear
along
in
their
course
in
their
plans
and
pleasures
and
daily
doings
the
force
of
all
the
life
of
the
place
if
any
expedition
of
consequence
is
afoot
are
the
expedition
others
may
join
in
or
hold
aloof
or
be
passed
by
in
which
last
cases
it
is
only
in
a
feeble
rippling
fashion
that
they
go
their
ways
and
seek
some
separate
pleasure
in
and
eddies
while
the
gay
hum
of
the
main
channel
goes
whirling
on
at
outledge
this
party
was
the
large
and
merry
schoolgirl
company
with
madam
routh
i
do
see
why
said
martha
josselyn
still
looking
out
as
the
little
red
left
the
door
of
the
green
cottage
i
do
see
why
those
new
girls
who
came
last
night
should
have
got
into
everything
in
a
minute
and
we
been
here
a
week
and
do
seem
to
catch
to
anything
at
all
some
people
are
like
burrs
i
think
or
drops
of
quicksilver
that
always
bunch
or
run
together
we
do
susie
what
the
reason
some
of
these
young
ladies
have
been
at
madam
routh
they
were
over
here
last
evening
sin
saxon
knows
them
very
well
you
knew
effie
saxon
at
school
too
eight
years
ago
and
this
is
the
little
one
that
nothing
you
petted
her
and
she
came
to
the
house
you
told
her
stories
hundreds
of
times
and
she
sees
we
all
by
ourselves
she
do
see
she
does
think
that
just
the
whole
of
it
people
ought
to
see
then
you
would
sue
and
you
know
it
i
been
used
to
seeing
and
thinking
used
yes
indeed
and
she
been
to
the
other
well
it
queer
how
the
parts
are
given
out
shall
we
go
to
the
pines
chapter
geodes
a
great
rearing
itself
up
rough
with
inaccessible
crags
bristling
with
old
ragged
pines
and
dark
with
glooms
of
close
cedars
and
hemlocks
above
a
jutting
table
of
rock
that
reaches
out
and
makes
a
huge
semicircular
base
for
the
mountain
and
is
in
itself
a
eighty
feet
sheer
up
from
the
close
in
against
the
hill
front
on
this
platform
of
stone
that
holds
its
foot
or
two
of
soil
a
little
poor
unshingled
house
with
a
tumbledown
about
it
attempting
the
indispensable
dooryard
of
all
better
here
where
the
great
natural
dooryard
or
esplanade
makes
it
such
an
utter
nonsense
this
is
the
place
at
which
the
little
red
drew
up
ten
minutes
later
to
leave
prissy
parcel
dakie
thayne
jumped
down
off
the
front
seat
and
held
up
his
arms
to
help
leslie
out
over
the
wheel
upon
her
declaring
that
she
must
go
and
do
the
errand
herself
to
get
a
nearer
look
at
hoskins
life
dakie
thayne
had
been
asked
at
leslie
suggestion
to
fill
the
vacant
sixth
seat
beside
the
driver
the
thoresbys
one
and
all
declining
thoresby
was
politic
she
would
not
fall
into
the
wake
of
this
schoolgirl
party
at
once
by
and
by
she
should
be
making
up
her
own
excursions
and
asking
whom
she
would
there
nothing
like
a
boy
of
that
age
for
use
upon
a
picnic
linceford
leslie
had
pleaded
with
playful
parody
in
his
behalf
when
the
lady
had
hinted
something
of
her
former
sentiment
concerning
the
encroachments
and
monopolies
of
boys
of
that
age
and
so
he
came
the
haddens
got
jim
holden
to
lift
them
down
on
the
opposite
side
for
a
run
to
the
verge
of
the
projecting
of
rock
that
like
a
gigantic
or
balcony
in
the
mighty
architecture
of
the
hills
looked
up
and
down
the
whole
perspective
of
the
valley
jim
holden
would
readily
have
driven
them
round
its
very
edge
upon
the
flat
mossy
sward
but
for
linceford
nerves
and
the
vague
idea
of
almost
an
accident
having
occurred
there
lately
which
pervaded
the
little
party
creggin
horses
had
backed
as
florrie
arnall
said
and
already
the
new
comers
had
picked
up
they
scarcely
knew
how
the
incipient
tradition
hereafter
to
grow
into
an
established
horror
of
the
cliff
it
was
nothing
jim
holden
said
only
the
nigh
hoss
was
a
crittur
an
contrived
to
git
his
leg
over
the
pole
no
danger
with
cattle
but
linceford
cried
out
in
utter
remonstrance
and
only
begged
leslie
to
be
quick
that
they
might
get
away
from
the
place
altogether
all
this
bustle
of
arrival
and
discussion
and
alighting
had
failed
curiously
to
turn
the
head
of
an
odd
child
a
girl
of
nine
or
ten
with
an
old
calico
flung
back
upon
her
shoulders
tangled
sunburnt
hair
tossing
above
it
gown
innocent
of
crinoline
clinging
to
lank
growing
limbs
and
bare
feet
whose
heels
were
energetically
planted
at
a
quite
safe
distance
from
each
other
to
insure
a
fair
base
for
the
centre
of
gravity
who
at
the
moment
of
their
coming
was
wrathfully
off
from
a
bit
of
rude
fenced
with
ends
of
twigs
stuck
a
tall
shanghai
hen
and
her
one
chicken
who
had
evidently
made
nothing
morally
or
physically
of
the
feeble
inclosure
i
wish
you
were
dead
and
in
your
gravies
cried
the
child
achieving
between
her
righteous
indignation
and
her
relenting
toward
her
uncouth
pets
at
the
last
breath
a
sufficiently
queer
play
upon
her
own
word
and
with
this
the
enemy
being
routed
she
turned
face
to
face
with
dakie
thayne
and
leslie
goldthwaite
coming
in
at
the
dilapidated
gate
they
scratched
up
all
my
she
said
and
then
her
rustic
shyness
overcame
suddenly
all
else
and
she
dragged
her
great
toe
back
and
forth
in
the
soft
mould
and
put
her
forefinger
in
her
mouth
and
looked
askance
at
them
from
the
corners
of
her
eyes
prissy
prissy
hoskins
leslie
addressed
her
in
sweet
inquiring
tones
but
the
child
stood
still
with
finger
in
mouth
and
toe
working
in
the
ground
not
a
bit
harder
nor
faster
nor
changing
in
the
least
for
more
or
less
the
shy
look
in
her
face
that
your
name
is
it
i
got
something
for
you
wo
you
come
and
get
it
leslie
paused
waiting
fearing
lest
a
further
advance
on
her
own
part
might
put
prissy
altogether
to
flight
nothing
answered
in
the
girl
eyes
to
her
words
there
was
no
lighting
up
of
desire
or
curiosity
however
restrained
she
stood
like
one
indifferent
or
uncomprehending
she
awful
deef
cried
a
new
voice
from
the
doorway
she
ai
that
scared
she
sarcy
enough
sometimes
a
woman
or
more
stood
on
the
rough
slanting
she
had
bare
feet
in
coarse
slippers
stringy
petticoats
differing
only
from
the
child
in
length
sleeves
rolled
up
to
the
shoulders
no
neck
garniture
not
a
bit
of
anything
white
about
her
over
all
looked
forth
a
face
sharp
and
hard
that
might
have
once
been
in
a
raw
country
fashion
and
that
had
undoubtedly
always
been
what
it
now
was
emphatically
an
stripe
of
black
hair
was
combed
each
way
over
her
forehead
and
rolled
up
on
her
temples
in
what
years
and
years
ago
used
to
be
called
most
appropriately
flat
curls
these
fastened
with
long
horn
beyond
was
a
strip
of
desert
no
hair
at
all
for
an
inch
and
a
half
more
toward
the
crown
the
rest
dragged
back
and
tied
behind
with
the
relentless
tightness
that
gradually
and
regularly
by
the
persistence
of
years
had
accomplished
this
peculiar
belt
of
clearing
it
completed
her
expression
it
was
as
a
very
halo
of
yankee
saintship
crowning
the
woman
who
in
despite
of
poverty
and
every
discouragement
had
always
hated
to
the
very
roots
of
her
hair
anything
like
what
she
called
a
sozzle
who
had
always
been
screwed
up
and
sharp
set
to
hard
work
she
help
the
tumbledown
fence
she
had
no
round
and
she
could
have
paid
for
a
hundred
pickets
and
a
day
carpentering
to
have
saved
her
life
she
could
help
prissy
hair
even
for
it
would
kink
and
curl
and
the
minute
the
wind
took
it
there
it
was
again
and
it
was
not
time
yet
thank
goodness
to
harrow
it
back
and
begin
in
her
behalf
the
remarkable
engineering
which
had
laid
out
for
herself
that
broad
highway
across
all
the
thrifty
and
energetic
bumps
up
to
veneration
who
knows
how
much
it
had
had
to
do
with
mixing
them
in
one
common
tingle
of
mutual
and
unceasing
activity
and
down
again
from
ear
to
ear
inside
the
poor
little
house
you
would
find
all
spick
and
span
the
old
floor
white
and
sanded
the
few
tins
and
the
pewter
spoons
shining
upon
the
shelf
the
brick
hearth
and
jambs
aglow
with
fresh
redding
table
and
chairs
set
back
in
rectangular
tidiness
only
one
thing
made
a
litter
or
tried
to
a
yellow
canary
that
hung
in
the
window
and
sang
like
a
house
afire
as
aunt
hoskins
said
however
that
is
and
flung
his
seeds
about
like
the
old
wash
at
edmonton
on
both
sides
of
the
way
prissy
was
turned
out
of
doors
in
all
pleasant
weather
so
otherwise
the
stayed
trim
and
her
curly
hair
grew
sunburnt
she
ben
deef
ever
sence
she
hed
the
walk
in
said
the
woman
by
no
means
satisfied
to
let
strangers
get
only
the
outside
impression
of
her
premises
and
turning
round
to
lead
the
way
without
waiting
for
a
reply
come
in
prissy
she
bawled
illustrating
her
summons
with
what
might
be
called
a
beckoning
in
broad
capitals
done
with
the
whole
arm
from
to
shoulder
twice
or
thrice
leslie
followed
over
the
threshold
and
prissy
ran
by
like
a
squirrel
and
perched
herself
on
a
stool
just
under
the
i
would
keep
it
if
war
for
her
said
aunt
hoskins
apologetically
she
was
prissy
aunt
holding
no
other
close
domestic
relation
to
living
thing
and
so
had
come
to
be
aunt
hoskins
in
the
whole
region
round
about
so
far
as
she
was
known
at
all
it
the
only
bird
she
can
hear
sing
of
a
morning
it
as
good
as
all
outdoors
to
her
and
i
hai
the
heart
to
make
her
do
without
it
done
without
most
things
but
it
do
appear
to
me
as
if
i
do
without
them
take
a
seat
do
i
thank
you
but
my
friends
are
waiting
i
brought
something
for
prissy
from
miss
craydocke
at
the
hotel
and
leslie
held
out
the
package
which
dakie
thayne
waiting
at
the
door
had
put
into
her
hand
as
she
came
in
lawful
suz
prissy
if
ai
another
book
cried
the
good
woman
as
prissy
quick
to
divine
the
meaning
of
the
parcel
the
like
of
which
she
had
been
made
accustomed
to
before
sprang
to
her
aunt
side
within
hearing
of
her
exclamation
if
she
ai
jest
the
feelingest
and
thoughtfullest
well
open
it
yourself
child
there
no
good
of
a
bundle
if
you
do
poor
prissy
was
thus
far
happy
that
she
had
not
been
left
in
the
providence
of
her
little
life
to
utter
ignorance
of
this
greatest
possible
delight
a
common
one
to
more
outwardly
favored
children
of
a
real
parcel
all
one
own
the
book
without
the
brown
paper
and
string
would
have
been
as
nothing
comparatively
leslie
could
not
but
linger
to
see
it
untied
there
came
out
a
book
a
wonderful
big
book
grimm
tales
and
some
little
papers
fell
to
the
floor
these
were
flower
seeds
bags
labeled
petunia
candytuft
double
balsam
portulaca
why
prissy
shouted
miss
hoskins
in
her
ear
as
she
picked
them
up
and
read
the
names
them
elegant
things
they
beat
your
all
to
nothin
it
lucky
the
old
did
make
a
clearin
of
tell
miss
craydocke
she
continued
turning
again
to
leslie
that
i
comin
down
myself
to
no
i
thank
her
made
a
for
that
child
out
o
nothin
leslie
stood
hushed
and
penetrated
in
the
presence
of
this
good
deed
and
the
joy
and
gratitude
born
of
it
this
ai
all
you
see
ai
nothin
new
she
ben
at
it
these
two
year
learnin
the
child
to
read
an
tellin
her
things
settin
her
to
hunt
out
and
to
do
for
herself
she
was
crazy
about
flowers
allers
an
stories
but
lor
i
could
stop
to
tell
to
her
an
i
never
knew
but
one
or
two
an
now
she
can
read
off
to
me
like
a
minister
she
told
her
a
lot
o
stuff
about
the
rocks
ca
make
head
nor
tail
o
but
it
please
you
to
see
her
in
by
the
an
goin
on
about
that
is
if
there
was
reely
any
place
to
put
afterwards
that
the
wust
o
i
tell
you
it
jest
a
life
out
o
pieces
that
come
to
hand
here
the
girl
an
there
the
woods
an
rocks
there
all
there
was
to
do
with
or
likely
to
be
but
she
found
the
gumption
an
the
willingness
she
done
it
prissy
came
close
over
to
leslie
with
her
book
in
her
hand
wait
a
minute
she
said
with
the
effort
in
her
tone
peculiar
to
the
deaf
i
got
something
to
send
back
it
convenient
you
mean
put
in
aunt
hoskins
sharply
she
as
blunt
as
a
broomstick
that
child
is
but
prissy
had
sprung
away
in
her
fashion
and
now
came
back
bringing
with
her
something
really
to
make
one
eyes
water
if
one
happened
at
least
to
be
ever
so
little
of
a
geologist
a
mass
of
quartz
rock
as
large
as
she
could
grasp
with
her
two
hands
shot
through
at
three
different
angles
with
three
long
superb
columnar
crystals
of
clear
beryl
if
professor
dana
had
known
this
exact
locality
and
a
more
definite
name
for
the
cliff
would
he
have
had
it
down
in
his
supplement
with
half
a
dozen
exclamation
points
after
the
beryl
i
found
it
said
prissy
with
the
utmost
simplicity
putting
the
heavy
specimen
out
of
her
own
hands
into
leslie
she
been
it
this
great
while
and
we
looked
for
it
everywheres
it
did
seem
as
if
the
magnificent
fragment
had
been
laid
in
the
way
of
the
child
zealous
and
grateful
search
there
were
only
the
rocks
as
aunt
hoskins
said
in
no
other
way
could
she
so
joyously
have
acknowledged
the
kindness
that
had
brightened
now
three
summers
of
her
life
it
bother
you
i
afeard
said
the
woman
no
indeed
i
shall
to
take
it
for
you
continued
leslie
with
a
warm
earnestness
stooping
down
to
the
little
girl
and
speaking
in
her
clear
glad
tone
close
to
her
cheek
i
only
wish
could
find
something
to
take
her
myself
and
with
that
close
to
the
little
cheek
as
she
was
she
put
the
period
of
a
quick
kiss
to
her
words
come
again
and
we
hunt
for
some
together
said
the
child
with
instant
response
of
cordiality
i
will
come
if
i
possibly
can
was
leslie
last
word
and
then
she
and
dakie
thayne
hurried
back
to
the
wagon
the
haddens
had
just
got
in
again
upon
their
side
they
were
full
of
exclamations
about
the
wonderful
view
up
and
down
the
long
you
need
tell
cried
elinor
in
high
enthusiasm
i
do
care
a
bit
for
the
geography
of
it
that
great
aisle
goes
straight
from
lake
umbagog
to
the
sound
it
is
a
glorious
picture
said
linceford
but
i
had
a
little
one
that
you
lost
you
no
idea
leslie
what
a
lovely
tableau
you
have
been
making
you
and
dakie
with
that
old
woman
and
the
blowzy
child
leslie
blushed
you
never
look
prettier
if
you
try
ever
so
hard
do
mrs
linceford
why
not
said
jeannie
it
only
a
pity
i
think
that
you
have
known
it
at
the
time
they
say
we
do
know
when
we
happiest
and
we
know
when
we
prettiest
so
where
the
satisfaction
that
part
of
your
mistake
jeannie
perhaps
returned
her
sister
if
you
had
been
there
you
have
spoiled
the
picture
look
at
that
exclaimed
leslie
showing
her
beryl
that
for
miss
craydocke
and
then
when
the
first
utterances
of
amazement
and
admiration
were
over
she
told
them
the
story
of
the
child
and
her
misfortune
and
of
what
miss
craydocke
had
done
beautiful
i
think
said
she
and
it
the
sort
of
beauty
may
be
that
one
might
feel
as
one
went
along
i
wish
i
could
find
a
diamond
for
that
woman
thir
garnits
on
put
in
jim
the
driver
oh
you
show
us
where
well
ai
nowhers

replied
jim
it
jest
as
you
light
on
and
you
would
know
the
best
ones
when
you
did
seen
dead
round
stones
that
crack
open
chock
full
o
red
garnits
as
an

cried
dakie
thayne
jim
holden
turned
round
and
looked
at
him
as
if
he
thought
he
had
got
hold
of
some
expletive
possibly
a
pretty
hard
one
they
came
down
now
on
the
other
side
of
the
cliff
and
struck
the
ford
this
diverted
and
absorbed
their
thoughts
for
none
of
the
ladies
had
ever
forded
a
river
before
are
you
sure
it
safe
asked
linceford
safe
as
meetin
returned
jim
i
drive
across
with
my
eyes
shot
oh
do
cried
elinor
i
ai
agoin
ter
but
i
could
an
the
hosses
too
for
that
matter
it
was
exciting
nevertheless
when
the
water
in
came
up
nearly
to
the
body
of
the
wagon
and
the
swift
ripples
deluded
the
eye
into
almost
conviction
that
horses
vehicle
and
all
were
not
gaining
an
inch
in
forward
progress
but
drifting
surely
down
they
came
up
out
of
the
depths
however
with
a
tug
and
a
swash
and
a
drip
all
over
and
a
scrambling
of
hoofs
on
the
pebbles
at
the
very
point
aimed
at
in
such
apparently
sidelong
fashion
the
that
led
them
up
the
bank
and
into
the
pine
woods
through
which
they
were
to
skirt
the
base
of
the
cairn
and
reach
on
his
accessible
side
it
was
one
long
fragrance
and
stillness
and
shadow
they
overtook
the
routh
party
at
the
beginning
of
the
the
pine
woods
stretched
on
over
the
gradual
slope
as
far
as
they
would
climb
before
dinner
otherwise
the
midday
heats
would
have
been
too
much
for
them
this
was
the
easy
part
of
the
way
and
there
was
breath
for
chat
and
merriment
just
within
the
upper
edge
of
the
woods
in
a
comparatively
smooth
opening
they
halted
here
they
spread
their
picnic
while
up
above
on
the
bare
open
rock
the
young
men
kindled
their
fire
and
heated
the
coffee
and
here
they
ate
and
drank
and
rested
through
the
noontide
light
clouds
flitted
between
the
mountains
and
the
heavens
later
in
the
day
and
flung
bewildering
dreamy
shadows
on
the
steeps
and
dropped
a
gracious
veil
over
the
bald
forehead
and
shoulders
of
it
was
weather
just
made
for
them
as
fortunate
excursionists
are
wont
to
say
sin
saxon
was
all
life
and
spring
and
fun
she
climbed
at
least
three
dancing
from
stone
to
stone
with
tireless
feet
and
bounding
back
and
forth
with
every
gay
word
that
it
occurred
to
her
to
say
to
anybody
pictures
she
made
them
incessantly
she
was
a
living
dissolving
view
you
no
sooner
got
one
bright
look
or
graceful
attitude
than
it
was
straightway
shifted
into
another
she
kept
frank
scherman
at
her
side
for
the
first
and
then
perhaps
his
admiration
or
his
muscles
tired
for
he
fell
back
a
little
to
help
madam
routh
up
a
sudden
ridge
and
afterwards
somehow
merged
himself
in
the
quieter
group
of
strangers
by
and
by
one
of
the
arnalls
whispered
to
mattie
shannon
he
sidled
off
with
her
at
last
did
you
ever
know
such
a
fellow
for
a
new
face
but
it
partly
the
petticoat
he
such
an
artist
eye
for
color
he
was
raving
about
her
all
the
while
she
stood
hanging
those
shawls
among
the
pines
to
keep
the
wind
from
linceford
she
is
downright
pretty
either
but
she
got
up
exquisitely
leslie
goldthwaite
in
her
lovely
mountain
dress
her
bright
bloom
from
enjoyment
and
exercise
with
the
stray
light
through
the
pines
burnishing
the
bronze
of
her
hair
had
innocently
made
a
second
picture
it
would
seem
one
such
effects
deeper
impression
sometimes
than
the
confusing
splendor
of
incessant
changes
are
you
looking
for
something
can
i
help
you
frank
scherman
had
said
coming
up
to
her
as
she
and
her
friend
dakie
a
little
apart
from
the
others
were
poising
among
some
loose
pebbles
nothing
that
i
have
lost
leslie
answered
smiling
something
i
have
a
very
presumptuous
wish
to
find
a
splendid
garnet
geode
if
you
please
that
not
at
all
impossible
returned
the
young
man
we
have
it
before
we
go
down
see
if
we
do
frank
scherman
knew
a
good
deal
about
and
something
of
geologizing
so
he
and
leslie
dakie
thayne
in
his
unswerving
devotion
still
accompanying
sidled
off
together
took
a
long
turn
round
under
the
crest
talking
very
pleasantly
and
restfully
after
sin
continuous
brilliancy
all
the
way
how
they
searched
among
loose
drift
under
the
cliff
how
scherman
improvised
a
hammer
from
a
slice
of
rock
and
how
after
many
imperfect
specimens
they
did
at
last
find
an
irregular
oval
of
dull
dusky
stone
which
burst
with
a
stroke
into
two
chalices
of
incrusted
crimson
crystals
i
ought
to
be
too
near
the
end
of
a
long
chapter
to
tell
but
this
search
and
this
finding
and
the
motive
of
it
were
the
soul
and
the
crown
of
pleasure
for
the
day
she
did
not
even
stop
to
think
how
long
she
had
had
frank
scherman
attention
all
to
herself
or
the
triumph
that
it
was
in
the
eyes
of
the
older
girls
among
whom
he
was
excessively
admired
and
not
very
disguisedly
competed
for
she
did
not
know
how
fast
she
was
growing
to
be
a
sort
of
admiration
herself
among
them
in
their
girls
fashion
or
what
she
might
do
if
she
chose
in
the
way
of
small
early
belleship
here
at
outledge
with
such
beginning
how
she
was
getting
on
in
short
as
girls
express
it
and
so
as
jeannie
hadden
asked
where
was
the
satisfaction
you
never
knew
anything
like
it
said
jeannie
to
her
friend
ginevra
talking
it
all
over
with
her
that
evening
in
a
bit
of
a
visit
to
thoresby
room
i
never
saw
anybody
take
so
among
strangers
madam
routh
was
delighted
with
her
and
so
i
should
think
was
scherman
they
say
he
hates
trouble
but
he
took
her
all
round
the
top
of
the
mountain
hammering
stones
for
her
to
find
a
geode
that
the
newest
dodge
said
thoresby
with
a
little
sarcastic
laugh
girls
of
that
sort
are
always
looking
for
geodes
after
this
thoresby
had
always
a
little
venom
for
leslie
goldthwaite
at
the
same
time
leslie
herself
coming
out
on
the
piazza
for
a
moment
after
tea
met
miss
craydocke
approaching
over
the
lawn
she
had
only
her
errand
to
introduce
her
but
she
would
not
lose
the
opportunity
she
went
straight
up
to
the
little
woman
in
a
frank
sweet
way
but
a
bit
of
embarrassment
underneath
the
real
respect
that
made
her
timid
perhaps
a
little
nervous
fatigue
after
the
excitement
and
exertion
of
the
day
did
what
nerves
and
embarrassment
and
reverence
itself
will
do
sometimes
played
a
trick
with
her
perfectly
clear
thought
on
its
way
to
her
tongue
miss
graywacke
i
believe
she
said
and
instantly
knew
the
dreadful
thing
that
she
had
done
exactly
said
the
lady
with
an
amused
little
smile
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
began
leslie
blushing
all
over
no
need
no
need
do
you
think
i
do
know
what
name
i
go
by
behind
my
back
they
suppose
because
i
old
and
plain
and
single
and
wear
a
front
and
do
understand
rats
and
the
german
that
i
deaf
and
blind
and
stupid
but
i
believe
i
get
as
much
as
they
do
out
of
their
jokes
after
all
the
dear
old
soul
took
leslie
by
both
her
hands
as
she
spoke
and
looked
a
whole
world
of
gentle
benignity
at
her
out
of
two
soft
gray
eyes
and
then
she
laughed
again
this
woman
had
no
to
be
hurt
we
stopped
at
the
cliff
this
morning
leslie
took
heart
to
say
and
they
were
so
glad
of
your
parcel
the
little
girl
and
her
aunt
and
prissy
gave
me
something
to
bring
back
to
you
a
splendid
specimen
of
beryl
that
she
has
found
then
my
mind
at
rest
said
miss
craydocke
cheerier
than
ever
i
was
sure
she
break
her
neck
or
pull
the
mountain
down
on
her
head
some
day
looking
for
it
would
you
like
i
found
i
should
like
you
to
have
that
too
a
garnet
geode
from
feather
cap
leslie
thought
she
had
done
it
very
clumsily
and
in
a
hurry
after
all
will
you
come
over
to
my
little
room
dear
number
fifteen
in
the
west
wing
sometime
with
your
stones
i
want
to
see
more
of
you
there
was
a
deliberate
gentle
emphasis
upon
her
words
if
the
grandest
person
of
whom
she
had
ever
known
had
said
to
leslie
goldthwaite
i
want
to
see
more
of
you
she
would
not
have
heard
it
with
a
warmer
thrill
than
she
felt
that
moment
at
her
heart
chapter
xi
in
the
pines
it
was
a
glorious
july
morning
and
there
was
nothing
particular
on
foot
in
the
afternoon
there
would
be
drives
and
walks
perhaps
for
some
hours
now
there
would
be
intensifying
heat
the
sun
had
burned
away
every
cloud
that
had
hung
rosy
about
his
rising
and
the
great
gray
flanks
of
washington
glared
in
a
pale
scorch
close
up
under
the
sky
whose
blue
fainted
in
the
flooding
presence
of
the
full
white
light
of
such
unblunted
day
here
and
there
adown
his
sides
something
flashed
out
in
a
clear
intense
dazzle
like
an
enormous
crystal
cropping
from
the
granite
and
blazing
with
reflected
splendor
these
were
the
leaps
of
water
from
out
dark
rifts
into
the
sun
everybody
will
be
in
the
pines
said
martha
josselyn
i
think
it
is
better
when
they
all
go
off
and
leave
us
we
can
go
up
under
our
rock
said
sue
putting
stockings
and
mending
cotton
into
a
large
light
basket
have
you
got
the
what
we
do
without
our
these
two
girls
had
bought
new
stockings
for
all
the
little
feet
at
home
that
the
weekly
darning
might
be
less
for
the
mother
while
they
were
away
and
had
come
with
their
own
patiently
cared
for
old
hose
which
they
should
have
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
embroider
they
had
made
a
sort
of
holiday
in
their
fashion
of
at
home
till
it
had
come
to
seem
like
a
positive
treat
and
rest
and
the
habit
was
so
strong
upon
them
that
they
hailed
it
even
here
they
always
got
out
their
little
when
they
sat
down
to
the
big
basket
together
they
could
darn
and
consider
and
move
and
darn
again
and
so
could
keep
it
up
all
day
long
as
else
even
they
would
have
found
it
nearly
intolerable
to
do
so
though
they
seemed
slower
at
it
they
really
in
the
end
saved
time
thursday
night
saw
the
tedious
work
all
done
and
the
basket
piled
with
neatly
folded
pairs
like
a
heap
of
fine
white
rolls
this
was
a
great
thing
and
enough
for
one
day
as
josselyn
said
it
was
disastrous
if
they
once
began
to
lie
over
if
they
could
be
disposed
of
between
sun
and
sun
the
girls
were
welcome
to
any
play
they
could
get
out
of
it
there
they
go
those
two
together
always
to
the
pines
and
always
with
a
said
leslie
goldthwaite
sitting
on
the
piazza
step
at
the
green
cottage
by
linceford
feet
the
latter
lady
occupying
a
shaker
behind
what
nice
girls
they
seem
to
be
and
nobody
appears
to
know
them
much
beyond
a
chicken
little
said
linceford
counting
up
from
thumb
to
little
finger
dakie
thayne
and
miss
craydocke
marmaduke
wharne
and
these
two
they
just
make
it
out
she
continued
counting
back
again
whatever
you
do
les
do
make
up
to
fox
lox
at
last
for
all
our
sakes
out
came
dakie
thayne
at
this
point
upon
them
with
his
hands
full
miss
leslie
you
head
these
needles
for
me
with
black
wax
i
want
them
for
my
butterflies
and
i
made
a
daub
and
scald
of
it
i
blistered
three
fingers
and
put
heads
to
two
miserable
pins
and
left
no
end
of
wax
splutters
on
my
table
i
but
two
sticks
more
and
the
deacon
do
keep
any
i
must
try
to
get
a
dozen
pins
out
of
it
at
least
he
had
his
and
a
lighted
homespun
candle
as
leslie
called
the
dips
of
manufacture
in
one
hand
and
a
pincushion
stuck
full
of
needles
waiting
for
tops
in
the
other
i
told
you
so
said
linceford
to
leslie
that
it
then
she
asked
of
dakie
thayne
what
butterflies
i
knew
you
some
hobby
or
other
i
said
so
i
glad
it
no
worse
she
answered
in
her
pleasant
smiling
way
dakie
thayne
had
a
great
liking
for
linceford
but
he
adored
leslie
goldthwaite
i
like
to
show
them
to
you
if
you
care
he
said
i
got
some
splendid
ones
one
great
turnus
that
i
brought
with
me
in
the
chrysalis
that
hatched
out
while
i
was
at
jefferson
i
rolled
it
up
in
a
paper
for
the
journey
and
fastened
it
in
the
crown
of
my
hat
had
it
ever
since
last
fall
the
asterias
worms
are
spinning
now
the
early
ones
they
out
on
the
in
shoals
i
feeding
up
a
dozen
of
in
a
box
they
very
handsome
bright
green
with
black
and
yellow
spots
and
it
the
queerest
thing
to
see
them
stiffen
out
and
change
you
do
they
do
it
all
at
once
asked
etty
thoresby
slipping
into
the
as
linceford
by
whom
she
had
come
and
placed
herself
within
the
last
minute
rose
and
went
in
to
follow
her
laundress
just
then
going
up
the
stairs
with
her
basket
pretty
much
it
seems
so
the
first
thing
you
know
they
stick
themselves
up
by
their
tails
and
spin
a
noose
to
hang
back
their
heads
in
and
there
they
are
like
a
papoose
in
a
basket
then
their
skin
turns
a
queer
dead
ashy
color
and
grows
somehow
straight
and
tight
and
they
only
squirm
a
little
in
a
feeble
way
now
and
then
and
grow
stiffer
and
stiffer
till
they
ca
squirm
at
all
and
then
mummies
and
that
the
end
of
it
till
the
butterflies
are
born
it
a
strange
thing
to
see
a
live
creature
go
into
its
own
shroud
and
hang
itself
up
to
turn
into
a
corpse
sometimes
a
live
one
crawling
round
to
find
a
place
for
itself
will
touch
a
mummy
accidentally
and
then
when
they
not
quite
gone
i
seen
give
an
odd
little
quiver
under
the
shell
as
if
they
were
almost
at
peace
and
did
want
to
be
intruded
on
or
called
back
to
earthly
things
and
the
new
comer
takes
the
hint
and
respects
privacy
and
moves
himself
off
to
find
quarters
somewhere
else
miss
leslie
how
splendidly
you
doing
those
the
difference
i
wonder
between
girls
fingers
and
boys
i
make
those
atoms
of
balls
so
round
and
perfect
i
died
and
suffered
as
miss
hoskins
says
it
only
centrifugal
force
said
leslie
spinning
round
between
her
finger
and
thumb
a
needle
to
whose
head
she
had
just
touched
a
globule
of
the
bright
black
wax
the
world
and
a
both
made
on
the
same
principle
the
haddens
and
imogen
thoresby
strolled
along
together
and
added
themselves
to
the
group
let
go
over
to
the
hotel
leslie
we
seen
nothing
of
the
girls
since
just
after
breakfast
they
must
be
up
in
the
hall
arranging
about
the
tableaux
i
come
by
and
by
if
you
want
me
do
wait
i
going
to
finish
these
properly
and
she
dipped
and
twirled
another
needle
with
dainty
precision
in
the
pause
between
her
words
have
you
got
a
lot
of
brothers
at
home
miss
leslie
asked
dakie
thayne
two
replied
leslie
not
at
home
though
now
one
at
exeter
and
the
other
at
cambridge
why
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
bad
what
do
you
call
it
political
economy
or
something
if
you
had
any
that
all
mamma
wants
you
said
ginevra
thoresby
looking
out
at
the
door
to
call
her
sisters
she
in
the
haughtleys
room
they
talking
about
the
wagon
for
minster
rock
what
you
take
up
your
time
with
that
boy
for
she
added
not
inaudibly
as
she
and
imogen
turned
away
together
oh
dear
cried
blunt
etty
lingering
i
wonder
if
she
meant
me
i
want
to
hear
about
the
caterpillars
mamma
thinks
the
haughtleys
are
such
nice
people
because
they
came
in
their
own
carriage
and
got
such
big
trunks
and
a
and
elegant
and
brushes
i
wish
she
did
care
so
much
about
such
things
thoresby
would
have
been
shocked
to
hear
her
little
arrangement
and
version
of
her
ideas
she
had
simply
been
kind
to
these
strangers
on
their
arrival
in
their
own
comfortable
carriage
a
few
days
since
had
stepped
forward
as
somehow
it
seemed
to
devolve
upon
her
with
her
dignified
air
and
handsome
gray
curls
when
she
chose
to
do
representing
by
a
kind
of
tacit
consent
the
household
in
general
as
somebody
in
every
such
sojourn
usually
will
had
interested
herself
about
their
rooms
which
were
near
her
own
and
had
reported
of
them
privately
among
other
things
noted
in
these
first
glimpses
that
they
had
everything
about
them
in
the
most
style
brushes
and
lovely
inlaid
ginevra
the
best
all
and
no
sham
yes
indeed
if
that
could
but
be
said
truly
and
need
not
stop
at
brushes
and
boxes
imogen
came
back
presently
and
called
to
etty
from
the
stairs
and
she
was
obliged
to
go
jeannie
hadden
waited
till
they
were
fairly
off
the
landing
and
then
walked
away
herself
saying
nothing
but
wearing
a
slightly
displeased
air
thoresby
and
her
elder
daughter
had
taken
a
sort
of
dislike
to
dakie
thayne
they
seemed
to
think
he
wanted
putting
down
nobody
knew
anything
about
him
he
was
well
enough
in
his
place
perhaps
but
why
should
he
join
himself
to
their
party
the
routh
girls
had
frank
scherman
and
two
or
three
other
older
attendants
among
them
he
was
simply
not
thought
of
often
at
all
if
it
had
not
been
for
leslie
and
linceford
he
would
have
found
himself
in
outledge
what
boys
of
his
age
are
apt
to
find
themselves
in
the
world
at
large
a
sort
of
odd
or
stray
not
provided
for
anywhere
in
the
general
scheme
of
society
for
this
very
reason
discerning
it
quickly
leslie
had
been
loyal
to
him
and
he
with
all
his
of
admiration
and
devotion
was
loyal
to
her
she
had
the
feeling
motherly
and
sisterly
in
its
mingled
instinct
by
which
all
true
and
fine
feminine
natures
are
moved
in
behalf
of
the
in
its
dawn
that
so
needs
sympathy
and
gentle
consideration
and
provision
and
that
certain
respect
which
calls
forth
and
fosters
to
be
allowed
and
acknowledged
to
be
somebody
lest
for
the
want
of
this
it
should
fail
unhappily
ever
to
be
anybody
she
was
not
aware
of
it
she
only
followed
her
kindly
instinct
so
she
was
doing
unconsciously
one
of
the
best
early
bits
of
her
in
the
world
once
in
a
while
it
occurred
to
leslie
goldthwaite
to
wonder
why
it
was
that
she
was
able
to
forget
that
she
found
she
had
forgotten
in
a
measure
those
little
that
she
had
been
afraid
of
and
that
had
puzzled
her
in
her
thoughtful
moments
she
was
glad
to
be
taken
up
with
something
that
could
please
dakie
thayne
or
to
go
over
to
the
cliff
and
see
prissy
hoskins
and
tell
her
a
story
or
help
dakie
to
fence
in
safely
her
beds
of
she
had
not
let
her
first
visit
be
her
last
in
these
weeks
since
her
introduction
there
or
to
sit
an
hour
with
dear
old
miss
craydocke
and
help
her
in
a
bit
of
charity
work
and
hear
her
sweet
simple
genial
talk
she
had
taken
up
her
little
opportunities
as
they
came
was
it
by
instinct
only
or
through
a
tender
that
she
winnowed
them
and
chose
the
best
and
had
so
been
kept
a
little
out
of
the
drift
and
hurry
that
might
else
have
frothed
away
the
hours
give
us
our
daily
bread
lead
us
not
into
temptation
they
have
to
do
with
each
other
if
we
know
the
daily
bread
when
we
see
it
but
that
also
is
of
the
grace
of
god
there
was
the
beginning
of
fruit
under
the
leaf
with
leslie
goldthwaite
and
the
fine
was
setting
itself
that
way
with
its
best
impulse
and
its
rarest
particles
the
pincushion
was
well
filled
with
the
delicate
bristling
needles
when
miss
craydocke
appeared
walking
across
under
her
great
brown
from
the
hotel
if
you
nothing
else
to
do
my
dears
suppose
we
go
over
to
the
pines
together
where
miss
jeannie
would
she
like
it
all
the
breeze
there
is
haunts
them
always
i
always
ready
for
the
pines
said
leslie
here
dakie
i
hope
you
catch
a
butterfly
for
every
pin
oh
now
i
think
of
it
have
you
found
your
yes
half
way
up
the
i
ca
feed
him
comfortably
miss
leslie
he
wants
to
eat
incessantly
and
the
wilt
so
quickly
if
i
bring
them
in
that
the
first
thing
i
know
he
out
of
proper
provender
and
off
on
a
raid
he
needs
to
be
on
the
tree
but
then
i
should
lose
him
leslie
thought
a
minute
you
might
tie
up
a
branch
with
she
said
is
that
bright
i
go
right
and
do
it
only
i
have
any
netting
said
he
linceford
has
i
go
and
beg
a
piece
for
you
and
then
if
you
just
sit
here
a
minute
i
come
miss
craydocke
when
she
came
back
she
brought
jeannie
with
her
to
use
a
vulgar
proverb
jeannie
nose
was
rather
out
of
joint
since
the
haughtleys
had
arrived
ginevra
thoresby
was
quite
engrossed
with
them
and
this
often
involved
imogen
there
was
only
room
for
six
in
captain
green
wagon
and
nothing
had
been
said
to
jeannie
about
the
drive
to
minster
rock
leslie
had
hanging
upon
her
finger
also
the
finest
and
whitest
and
most
graceful
of
all
possible
little
splint
baskets
only
just
big
enough
to
carry
a
bit
of
such
work
as
was
in
it
now
a
strip
of
sheer
delicate
which
needle
and
thread
with
her
deft
guidance
were
turning
into
a
cobweb
border
by
a
weaving
of
strong
yet
light
where
the
woof
of
the
original
material
had
been
drawn
out
it
was
done
for
work
and
was
better
than
anything
she
could
buy
prettier
it
certainly
was
when
with
a
finishing
of
the
merest
edge
of
lace
it
came
to
encircle
her
round
fair
arms
and
shoulders
or
to
peep
out
with
its
dainty
revelation
among
the
gathering
treasures
of
the
i
told
you
of
she
had
accomplished
yards
of
it
already
for
her
holiday
work
she
had
brought
the
netting
as
she
promised
for
dakie
thayne
who
received
it
with
thanks
and
straightway
hastened
off
to
get
his
elephant
and
a
piece
of
string
and
to
find
a
convenient
which
he
could
convert
into
a
i
come
round
to
the
pines
afterward
he
said
and
just
then
sin
saxon
bright
face
and
pretty
figure
showing
themselves
on
the
hotel
piazza
with
a
seeking
look
and
gesture
jeannie
and
elinor
were
drawn
off
also
to
ask
about
the
tableaux
and
see
if
they
were
wanted
with
the
like
promise
that
they
would
come
presently
so
miss
craydocke
and
leslie
walked
slowly
round
under
the
to
the
head
of
the
ledge
by
themselves
up
this
rocky
promontory
it
was
very
pretty
little
climbing
over
the
irregular
crags
that
made
the
ascent
and
once
up
it
was
charming
a
natural
grove
of
stately
old
with
their
glory
of
tasseled
foliage
and
their
breath
of
perfume
crowned
and
sheltered
it
and
here
had
been
placed
at
cosy
angles
under
the
deepest
shade
long
broad
elastic
benches
of
boards
sprung
from
rock
to
rock
and
made
secure
to
stakes
or
held
in
place
by
convenient
irregularities
of
the
rock
itself
and
granite
offered
rough
support
to
backs
that
could
so
fit
themselves
and
visitors
found
out
their
favorite
seats
and
spent
hours
there
with
books
or
work
or
looking
forth
in
a
luxurious
listlessness
from
out
the
cool
upon
the
warm
bright
and
the
shining
water
wandering
down
from
far
heights
and
unknown
solitudes
to
see
the
world
it
better
so
said
miss
craydocke
when
the
others
left
them
i
had
a
word
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
what
do
you
suppose
those
two
came
up
here
to
the
mountains
for
and
miss
craydocke
nodded
up
indicatively
toward
the
two
just
visible
by
their
draperies
in
a
nook
of
rock
beyond
and
above
the
benches
to
get
the
good
of
them
as
we
did
i
suppose
leslie
answered
wondering
a
little
what
miss
craydocke
might
exactly
mean
i
suppose
so
too
was
the
reply
and
i
suppose
the
lord
love
came
with
them
i
suppose
he
cares
whether
they
get
the
full
of
the
good
and
yet
i
think
he
leaves
it
like
everything
else
a
little
to
us
leslie
heart
beat
quicker
hearing
these
words
it
beat
quicker
always
when
such
thoughts
were
touched
she
was
shy
of
seeking
them
she
almost
tried
in
an
involuntary
way
to
escape
them
at
first
when
they
were
openly
broached
yet
she
longed
always
at
the
same
time
for
a
deeper
understanding
of
them
i
should
like
to
know
the
miss
josselyns
better
she
said
presently
when
miss
craydocke
made
no
haste
to
speak
again
i
have
been
thinking
so
this
morning
i
have
thought
so
very
often
but
they
seem
so
quiet
always
one
does
like
to
intrude
they
ought
to
be
more
with
young
people
miss
craydocke
went
on
and
they
ought
to
do
less
ripping
and
sewing
and
darning
if
it
could
be
managed
they
brought
three
trunks
with
them
and
what
do
you
think
the
third
is
full
of
leslie
had
no
idea
of
course
old
winter
dresses
to
be
made
over
for
the
children
at
home
so
that
their
mother
may
be
coaxed
to
take
her
turn
and
go
away
upon
a
visit
when
they
get
back
seeing
that
the
fall
sewing
will
be
half
done
that
a
pretty
coming
to
the
mountains
for
two
young
things
i
think
oh
dear
cried
leslie
pitifully
and
then
a
secret
compunction
seized
her
thinking
of
her
own
little
elegant
work
which
was
all
she
had
to
interfere
with
mountain
pleasure
and
is
it
some
of
our
business
if
we
could
get
at
it
asked
miss
craydocke
concluding
dear
miss
craydocke
said
leslie
with
a
warm
brightness
in
her
face
as
she
looked
up
the
world
is
full
of
business
but
so
few
people
find
out
any
but
their
own
nobody
but
you
dreamt
of
this
or
of
prissy
hoskins
till
you
showed
us
or
of
all
the
little
wigleys
how
do
you
come
to
know
when
other
people
go
on
in
their
own
way
and
see
nothing
like
the
priests
and
levites
this
last
she
added
by
a
sudden
occurrence
and
application
that
half
answered
beforehand
her
own
question
when
we
think
of
people
needs
as
the
said
miss
craydocke
evading
herself
and
never
minding
her
syntax
when
we
think
what
every
separate
soul
is
to
him
that
he
came
into
the
world
to
care
for
as
god
cares
for
the
sparrows
it
my
faith
that
he
never
gone
away
from
his
work
dear
that
his
love
lies
alongside
every
life
and
in
all
its
experience
and
that
his
life
is
in
his
love
and
that
if
we
want
to
find
him
we
may
inasmuch
as
ye
have
done
it
unto
the
least
of
these
ye
have
done
it
unto
me
she
grew
eloquent
the
plain
woman
when
something
that
was
great
and
living
to
her
would
find
utterance
how
do
you
mean
that
said
leslie
with
a
sort
of
abruptness
as
of
one
who
must
have
definiteness
but
who
hurried
with
her
asking
lest
after
a
minute
she
might
not
dare
that
he
really
knows
and
thinks
of
every
special
thing
and
person
and
cares
or
only
i
take
it
as
he
said
it
said
miss
craydocke
power
is
given
me
in
heaven
and
in
earth
lo
i
am
with
you
alway
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
he
put
the
two
together
himself
dear
a
great
warm
instant
glow
seemed
to
rush
over
leslie
inwardly
in
the
light
and
quickening
of
it
other
words
shone
out
and
declared
themselves
abide
in
me
and
i
in
you
as
the
branch
can
not
bear
fruit
of
itself
except
it
abide
in
the
vine
no
more
can
ye
except
ye
abide
in
me
and
this
was
the
abiding
the
sympathy
the
interest
that
found
itself
side
by
side
with
his
the
faith
that
felt
his
uniting
presence
with
all
to
this
child
of
sixteen
came
a
moment
glimpse
of
what
might
be
truly
that
life
which
is
hid
with
christ
in
god
and
which
has
its
blessed
work
with
the
lord
in
the
world
came
with
the
word
of
a
plain
old
unconsidered
woman
whom
heedless
girls
made
daily
sport
of
came
bringing
with
it
old
and
new
like
a
householder
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
showing
how
the
life
and
the
fruit
are
inextricably
one
how
the
growth
and
the
withering
are
inevitably
determined
they
reached
the
benches
now
they
saw
the
josselyns
busy
up
beyond
with
their
between
them
and
their
mending
basket
at
their
feet
they
would
not
go
now
and
interrupt
their
game
the
seat
which
the
sisters
had
chosen
because
it
was
just
a
quiet
little
corner
for
two
was
a
nook
scooped
out
as
it
were
in
a
jut
of
granite
hollowed
in
behind
and
perpendicularly
to
a
height
above
their
heads
and
embracing
a
mossy
little
flat
below
so
that
it
seemed
like
a
great
solid
armchair
into
which
two
could
get
together
and
a
third
could
not
possibly
intrude
miss
craydocke
and
leslie
settled
themselves
and
both
were
silent
presently
leslie
spoke
again
giving
out
a
fragmentary
link
of
the
train
of
thought
that
had
been
going
on
in
her
if
it
were
for
just
one
thing
she
said
and
there
she
stopped
what
asked
miss
craydocke
as
not
a
bit
at
a
loss
to
made
out
the
unseen
connection
the
old
puzzle
we
to
think
and
work
a
good
deal
of
the
time
for
ourselves
and
then
we
lose
sight
of
him
why
leslie
said
no
more
but
waited
miss
craydocke
tone
was
clear
untroubled
the
young
girl
looked
therefore
for
this
clear
confidence
to
be
spoken
out
why
since
he
is
close
to
life
also
and
cares
tenderly
for
that
since
if
we
let
him
possess
himself
of
it
it
is
one
of
his
own
channels
by
which
he
still
gives
himself
unto
the
world
he
did
do
it
all
in
one
single
history
of
three
years
my
child
or
out
there
in
judaea
he
keeps
on
so
i
believe
through
every
possible
way
and
circumstance
of
human
living
now
if
only
the
life
is
grafted
on
his
the
vine
and
the
branches
and
god
tending
all
and
the
fruit
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
it
is
never
too
late
and
never
impossible
for
a
human
face
to
look
beautiful
in
the
soft
light
and
shadow
of
the
stirring
pines
with
the
moving
from
within
of
that
which
at
once
illumined
and
veiled
with
an
exultation
and
an
awe
there
came
a
glory
over
the
homely
and
faded
features
which
they
could
neither
bar
nor
dim
and
the
thought
took
possession
of
the
word
and
tone
and
made
them
simply
grand
and
heavenly
musical
after
that
they
sat
still
again
it
matters
not
how
many
minutes
the
crisp
green
spines
rustled
dreamily
over
their
heads
the
wild
birds
called
to
each
other
far
back
in
the
closer
lying
woods
the
water
glanced
on
millions
of
new
drops
every
instant
making
the
circles
and
gushes
and
falls
and
the
wealth
of
summer
sunshine
holding
and
vivifying
all
leslie
had
word
and
scene
stamped
together
on
her
spirit
and
memory
in
those
moments
there
was
a
presence
in
the
hush
and
beauty
two
souls
were
here
met
together
in
the
name
of
the
living
christ
and
for
that
there
is
the
promise
martha
josselyn
and
her
sister
sat
and
played
and
mended
on
by
and
by
dakie
thayne
came
said
a
bright
word
or
two
glanced
round
in
restless
as
if
taking
in
the
elements
of
the
situation
and
considering
what
was
to
be
made
out
of
it
perceived
the
pair
at
chess
and
presently
with
his
mountain
stick
went
springing
away
from
point
to
point
up
and
around
the
piles
and
masses
of
rock
and
mound
that
made
up
the
broadening
ascent
of
the
ledge
check
to
your
queen
said
sue
martha
put
her
elbow
upon
her
knee
and
held
her
needle
suspended
by
its
thread
sue
darned
away
and
got
a
great
hole
laid
lengthwise
with
smooth
lines
before
her
threatening
move
had
been
provided
for
then
a
red
knight
came
with
gallant
leap
right
down
in
the
midst
of
the
white
forces
menacing
in
his
turn
right
and
left
and
martha
drew
a
long
sigh
and
sat
back
and
poised
her
again
and
went
to
work
and
it
was
sue
turn
to
lean
over
the
board
with
knit
brows
and
holden
breath
something
peered
over
the
rock
above
them
at
this
moment
a
boy
head
from
which
the
cap
had
been
removed
if
only
they
play
now
and
not
chatter
thought
dakie
thayne
lying
prone
along
the
cliff
above
and
putting
up
his
elbows
to
rest
his
head
between
his
hands
this
be
jolly
if
it
do
turn
to
eavesdropping
poor
old
noll
i
have
had
a
game
since
i
played
with
him
sue
would
not
withdraw
her
attack
she
planted
a
bishop
so
that
if
the
knight
should
move
it
would
open
a
course
straight
down
toward
a
weak
point
beside
the
red
king
she
means
to
it
out
on
that
line
if
it
takes
all
summer
dakie
went
on
within
himself
having
grasped
during
the
long
pause
before
sue
move
the
whole
position
they
no
fools
at
it
to
have
got
it
into
a
shape
like
that
i
just
like
noll
to
see
it
martha
looked
and
drew
a
thread
or
two
into
her
stocking
and
looked
again
then
she
stabbed
her
with
her
needle
and
put
up
both
hands
one
with
the
white
still
drawn
over
it
beside
her
temples
at
last
she
castled
sue
was
as
calm
as
the
morning
she
always
grew
calm
and
strong
as
the
game
drew
near
the
end
she
had
even
let
her
thoughts
go
off
to
other
things
while
martha
pondered
and
she
wove
in
the
of
her
darn
i
wonder
martha
she
said
now
suddenly
before
attending
to
the
new
aspect
of
the
board
if
i
could
do
without
that
muslin
skirt
i
made
to
wear
under
my
and
turn
it
into
a
couple
of
white
waists
to
carry
home
to
mother
if
she
goes
away
you
know
aigh
it
was
a
short
sharp
unspellable
sound
that
came
from
above
sue
started
and
a
red
piece
rolled
from
the
board
then
there
was
a
rustling
and
a
crashing
and
a
leaping
and
by
a
much
shorter
and
more
hazardous
way
than
he
had
climbed
dakie
thayne
came
down
and
stood
before
them
i
had
to
let
you
know
i
could
listen
i
was
in
hopes
you
would
talk
do
move
please
i
find
the
man
i
do
beg
your
pardon
i
had
no
business
but
i
so
like
chess
when
it
any
sort
of
a
game
while
he
spoke
he
was
looking
about
the
base
of
the
rock
and
by
good
fortune
spied
and
pounced
upon
the
bit
of
ivory
which
had
rolled
and
rested
itself
against
a
hummock
of
sod
may
i
see
it
out
he
begged
approaching
and
putting
the
piece
upon
the
board
you
must
have
played
a
good
deal
looking
at
sue
we
play
often
at
home
my
sister
and
i
and
i
had
some
good
practice
in
there
she
stopped
in
the
hospital
said
martha
with
the
sharp
little
way
she
took
up
sometimes
why
should
you
tell
of
it
has
miss
josselyn
been
in
the
hospitals
asked
dakie
thayne
with
a
certain
quick
change
in
his
tone
for
the
best
of
two
years
martha
answered
at
this
moment
seeing
how
dakie
was
breaking
the
ice
for
them
up
came
miss
craydocke
and
leslie
goldthwaite
miss
leslie
miss
craydocke
this
lady
has
been
away
among
our
soldiers
in
the
hospitals
half
through
the
war
perhaps
did
you
ever
but
with
that
he
broke
off
there
was
a
great
flush
on
his
face
and
his
eyes
glowed
with
lit
at
the
thought
of
the
war
and
of
brave
men
and
of
noble
ministering
women
of
whom
he
suddenly
found
himself
face
to
face
with
one
the
game
of
chess
got
swept
together
it
was
as
good
as
over
martha
josselyn
said
and
these
five
sat
down
together
among
the
rocks
and
in
half
an
hour
after
weeks
of
mere
they
had
grown
to
be
old
friends
but
dakie
thayne
he
best
knew
why
left
his
fragment
of
a
question
unfinished
chapter
xii
crowded
out
the
by
and
by
people
came
at
last
jeannie
and
elinor
and
sin
saxon
and
the
arnalls
and
josie
scherman
they
wanted
leslie
to
tell
and
ask
her
half
a
hundred
things
about
the
projected
tableaux
if
it
had
only
been
miss
craydocke
and
the
josselyns
sitting
together
with
dakie
thayne
how
would
that
have
concerned
them
the
later
comers
it
would
only
have
been
a
bit
of
the
pines
preoccupied
they
would
have
found
a
place
for
themselves
and
gone
on
with
their
own
chatter
but
presence
made
all
the
difference
the
little
group
became
the
nucleus
of
the
enlarging
circle
miss
craydocke
had
known
very
well
how
this
would
be
they
asked
this
and
that
of
leslie
which
they
had
come
to
ask
and
she
would
keep
turning
to
the
josselyns
and
appealing
to
them
so
they
were
drawn
in
there
was
a
curtain
to
be
made
first
of
all
miss
craydocke
would
undertake
that
drafting
leslie
and
the
miss
josselyns
to
help
her
they
should
all
come
to
her
room
early
and
they
would
have
it
ready
by
ten
leslie
wondered
a
little
that
she
found
for
them
to
do
a
part
of
the
play
she
thought
would
have
been
better
but
miss
craydocke
knew
how
that
must
come
about
besides
she
had
more
than
one
little
line
to
lay
and
to
pull
this
old
maiden
in
behalf
of
her
ultimate
designs
concerning
them
i
ca
stay
here
under
the
pines
and
tell
you
all
their
talk
this
summer
morning
how
sin
saxon
grew
social
and
saucy
with
the
quiet
miss
josselyns
how
she
fell
upon
the
and
their
notability
and
declared
that
the
most
foolish
and
pernicious
proverb
in
the
world
was
that
old
thing
about
a
stitch
in
time
saving
nine
it
might
save
certain
special
stitches
but
how
about
the
itself
and
stitches
she
did
believe
in
it
running
round
after
a
and
forty
other
things
the
minute
a
thread
broke
and
dropping
whatever
else
one
had
in
hand
to
let
it
ravel
itself
all
out
again
she
believed
in
a
good
big
basket
in
a
dark
closet
and
laying
up
there
for
a
rainy
day
and
being
at
peace
in
the
pleasant
weather
then
too
there
was
another
thing
she
did
believe
in
notability
itself
at
all
the
more
one
was
fool
enough
to
know
the
more
one
had
to
do
all
one
life
long
providence
always
took
care
of
the
lame
and
the
lazy
and
besides
those
capable
people
never
had
contented
minds
they
could
keep
servants
their
own
fingers
were
always
itching
to
do
things
better
her
sister
effie
was
a
lamentable
instance
she
married
a
man
well
not
rich
and
she
had
set
out
to
learn
and
direct
everything
the
consequence
was
she
was
like
eve
after
the
apple
she
knew
good
and
evil
and
was
the
garden
just
a
wilderness
after
that
she
never
thought
of
it
before
but
she
believed
that
was
exactly
what
that
old
poem
in
genesis
was
written
for
how
miss
craydocke
answered
with
her
gentle
tolerant
and
right
thought
and
brightness
how
the
josselyns
grew
cordial
and
confident
enough
to
confess
that
with
five
little
children
in
the
house
there
was
a
great
necessity
for
laying
up
against
a
rainy
day
and
with
stockings
at
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
pair
one
was
apt
to
get
the
nine
stitches
or
a
pretty
comfortable
multiple
of
them
every
wednesday
when
the
wash
came
in
and
how
these
different
kinds
of
lives
coming
together
with
a
friendly
friction
found
themselves
not
so
uncongenial
or
so
incomprehensible
to
each
other
after
all
all
this
in
its
detail
of
bright
words
i
can
not
stop
to
tell
you
it
would
take
a
good
many
summers
to
go
through
one
like
this
so
fully
but
when
the
big
bell
rang
for
dinner
they
all
came
down
the
ledge
together
and
sue
and
martha
josselyn
for
the
first
time
in
four
weeks
felt
themselves
fairly
one
with
the
current
interest
and
life
of
the
gay
house
in
which
they
had
been
dwellers
and
yet
only
thoresby
coming
down
to
dinner
a
few
minutes
late
with
her
daughters
and
pausing
as
people
always
did
at
the
green
cottage
without
knowing
why
to
step
from
the
foot
of
the
stairway
to
the
open
and
glance
out
before
turning
toward
the
saw
the
ledge
party
just
dividing
itself
into
its
two
little
streams
that
were
to
head
respectively
for
cottage
and
hotel
it
is
a
wonder
to
me
that
linceford
allows
it
was
her
comment
just
the
odds
and
ends
of
all
the
company
here
and
those
girls
who
might
take
whatever
stand
they
pleased
miss
leslie
always
finds
out
the
nicest
people
and
the
best
times
think
said
etty
who
had
dragged
through
but
a
dull
morning
behind
the
blinds
of
her
mother
window
puzzling
over
crochet
which
she
hated
because
she
said
it
was
like
everlastingly
poking
one
finger
after
a
sliver
and
had
caught
now
and
then
over
the
still
air
the
laughter
and
that
came
together
from
among
the
pines
one
of
the
miss
haughtleys
had
sat
with
them
but
that
only
stiffened
out
the
dullness
as
etty
had
declared
the
instant
the
young
lady
left
them
do
be
pert
etty
you
do
know
what
you
want
or
what
is
for
your
interest
the
haddens
were
well
enough
by
themselves
but
when
it
comes
to
tom
dick
and
harry
i
do
believe
that
elegant
mamma
said
etty
demurely
and
there
is
tom
dick
nor
harry
only
dakie
thayne
and
that
nice
miss
craydocke
and
i
the
haughtleys
this
with
a
sudden
explosiveness
at
the
last
after
the
demureness
etty
and
thoresby
intoned
an
indescribable
astonishment
of
displeasure
in
her
utterance
of
her
daughter
name
remember
yourself
you
are
neither
to
be
impertinent
to
me
nor
to
speak
rudely
of
persons
whom
i
choose
for
your
acquaintance
when
you
are
older
you
will
come
to
understand
how
these
chance
meetings
may
lead
to
the
most
valuable
friendships
or
on
the
contrary
to
the
most
mortifying
embarrassments
in
the
mean
time
you
are
to
be
guided
after
which
little
sententious
homily
out
of
the
book
of
the
world
thoresby
ruffled
herself
with
dignity
and
led
her
brood
away
with
her
next
day
tom
dick
and
harry
that
is
to
say
miss
craydocke
susan
and
martha
josselyn
and
leslie
goldthwaite
were
gathered
in
the
lady
room
to
make
the
great
green
curtain
and
there
sin
saxon
came
in
upon
them
ostensibly
to
bring
the
and
explain
how
she
wanted
them
put
on
but
after
that
she
lingered
it
like
the
tower
of
babel
upstairs
she
said
and
just
about
as
likely
ever
to
get
built
i
ca
bear
to
stay
where
i
ca
hear
myself
talk
you
nice
and
cosy
here
miss
craydocke
and
with
that
she
settled
herself
down
on
the
floor
with
all
her
little
ruffles
and
flounces
and
billows
of
muslin
heaping
and
curling
themselves
about
her
till
her
pretty
head
and
shoulders
were
like
a
new
and
charming
sort
of
in
the
midst
and
it
came
to
pass
that
presently
the
talk
drifted
round
to
vanities
and
vexations
on
this
wise
everybody
wants
to
be
everything
said
sin
saxon
they
do
say
so
of
course
but
they
keep
objecting
and
unsettling
nothing
hushes
anybody
up
but
proposing
them
for
some
especially
magnificent
part
and
you
ca
hush
them
all
at
once
in
that
way
if
they
only
what
they
want
and
be
done
with
it
but
they
so
dreadfully
polite
only
finding
out
continual
reasons
why
nobody
will
do
for
this
and
that
or
have
time
to
dress
or
something
and
waiting
modestly
to
be
suggested
and
shut
up
when
i
came
down
they
were
in
full
tilt
about
lady
of
shalott
it
to
be
one
of
the
crack
scenes
you
know
river
of
blue
cambric
and
a
real
regular
lovely
frank
scherman
sent
for
it
and
it
came
up
on
the
stage
yesterday
drivers
swearing
all
the
way
now
they
go
on
for
half
an
hour
at
least
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
shall
walk
in
upon
the
plain
of
shinar
with
my
hair
all
let
down
it
real
every
of
not
a
tail
tied
on
anywhere
and
tell
them
i
myself
am
to
be
the
lady
of
shalott
i
think
i
shall
relish
flinging
in
that
little
bit
of
honesty
like
a
dash
of
cold
water
into
the
middle
of
a
fry
wo
it
sizzle
she
sat
twirling
the
cord
upon
which
the
dozens
of
great
brass
rings
were
strung
watching
the
shining
ellipse
they
made
as
they
revolved
like
a
child
set
down
upon
the
carpet
with
a
plaything
expecting
no
answer
only
waiting
for
the
next
vagrant
whimsicality
that
should
come
across
her
brain
not
altogether
without
method
either
to
give
it
utterance
i
do
suppose
i
could
convince
you
of
it
she
resumed
but
i
do
actually
have
serious
thoughts
sometimes
i
think
that
very
likely
some
of
us
most
of
us
are
going
to
the
dogs
and
i
wonder
what
it
will
be
when
we
get
there
why
do
you
contradict
or
confirm
what
i
say
miss
craydocke
you
have
said
out
yet
have
you
sin
saxon
opened
wide
her
great
wondering
saucy
blue
eyes
and
turned
them
full
upon
miss
craydocke
face
well
you
a
oner
as
somebody
in
dickens
says
there
no
such
thing
as
a
leading
question
for
you
it
like
the
rope
the
dog
slipped
his
head
out
of
and
left
the
man
holding
fast
at
the
other
end
in
touching
confidence
that
he
was
coming
on
i
saw
that
once
on
broadway
now
i
experience
it
i
suppose
i
got
to
say
more
well
then
in
a
general
way
do
you
think
living
amounts
to
anything
miss
craydocke
whose
living
sharp
as
a
knife
that
just
cut
through
a
lemon
then
if
you
please
us
girls
for
instance
you
have
done
much
of
your
living
yet
my
dear
the
tone
was
gentle
as
of
one
who
looked
down
from
such
a
height
of
years
that
she
felt
tenderly
the
climbing
that
had
been
for
those
who
had
it
yet
to
do
we
as
busy
at
it
too
as
we
can
be
but
sometimes
i
mistrusted
something
like
what
i
discovered
very
indignantly
one
day
when
i
was
four
years
old
and
fancied
i
was
making
a
petticoat
sewing
through
and
through
a
bit
of
flannel
the
thread
had
any
knot
in
it
that
was
very
well
too
until
you
knew
just
where
to
put
the
stitches
that
should
stay
which
brings
us
to
our
subject
of
the
morning
as
the
sermons
say
sometimes
when
they
half
through
or
ought
to
be
there
are
all
kinds
of
stitches
embroidery
and
plain
and
whippings
and
darns
when
are
we
to
make
our
knot
and
begin
and
which
kind
are
we
to
do
most
lives
find
occasion
more
or
less
for
each
practiced
fingers
will
know
how
to
manage
all
but
it
the
cried
sin
in
a
crescendo
that
ended
with
an
emphasis
that
was
nearly
a
little
scream
i
think
that
when
one
looks
to
what
is
really
needed
most
and
first
will
arrange
itself
said
miss
craydocke
something
gets
crowded
out
with
us
all
it
depends
upon
what
and
how
and
with
what
willingness
we
let
it
go
we
come
to
the
superlative
sort
of
people
the
extra
good
ones
who
let
everything
go
that
is
solid
duty
all
the
ornament
of
life
good
looks
tidiness
even
and
everything
that
the
least
bit
jolly
and
that
do
keep
your
on
the
strain
i
want
to
be
at
least
now
and
then
i
ca
bear
ferociously
elevated
people
who
wo
say
a
word
that
do
count
people
that
talk
about
their
time
being
interrupted
as
if
their
time
was
everybody
else
time
too
because
somebody
comes
in
once
in
a
while
for
a
friendly
call
and
who
go
about
the
streets
as
if
they
were
so
intent
upon
some
tremendous
good
work
or
big
thinking
that
it
would
be
dangerous
even
to
bow
to
a
common
sinner
for
fear
of
being
waylaid
and
hindered
i
know
people
like
that
and
all
i
to
say
is
that
if
they
to
make
up
the
heavenly
circles
i
full
as
lief
go
down
lower
where
they
kind
of
social
there
can
scarcely
be
a
subject
touched
in
ever
so
light
a
way
especially
a
moral
or
a
spiritual
subject
in
however
small
a
company
of
persons
that
shall
not
set
in
motion
varied
and
intense
currents
of
thought
bear
diverse
and
searching
application
to
consciousness
and
experience
the
josselyns
sat
silent
with
the
long
breadths
of
green
cambric
over
their
laps
listening
with
an
amusement
that
freshened
into
their
habitual
mood
like
a
willful
little
summer
breeze
born
out
of
blue
morning
skies
unconscious
of
clouds
to
the
oddities
of
sin
saxon
but
the
drift
of
her
sayings
the
meaning
she
actually
had
under
them
bore
down
upon
their
different
knowledge
with
a
significance
whose
sharpness
she
had
no
dream
of
plain
how
well
it
illustrated
what
their
young
days
and
the
disposal
of
them
had
been
miss
craydocke
thought
of
the
darns
her
story
can
not
be
told
here
but
she
knew
what
it
meant
to
have
the
darns
of
life
fall
to
one
share
to
have
the
filling
up
to
do
with
dexterousness
and
pains
and
sacrifice
of
holes
that
other
people
make
for
leslie
goldthwaite
she
got
the
next
word
of
the
lesson
she
was
learning
depends
on
what
one
is
willing
to
let
get
crowded
sin
saxon
went
on
again
i
had
a
special
disgust
given
me
to
superiority
i
would
be
superior
for
all
the
world
we
had
a
superior
specimen
come
among
us
at
highslope
last
year
she
there
yet
it
commonly
believed
but
nobody
takes
the
trouble
to
be
positive
of
it
reason
why
she
took
up
immediately
such
a
position
of
mental
and
moral
altitude
above
our
heads
and
became
so
sublimely
unconscious
of
all
beneath
that
all
beneath
was
going
to
strain
its
neck
to
look
after
her
much
less
provide
itself
with
telescopes
we
pretty
nice
people
we
think
but
we
not
particularly
curious
in
astronomy
we
heard
great
things
of
her
beforehand
and
we
were
all
ready
to
make
much
of
her
we
asked
her
to
our
parties
she
came
with
a
look
upon
her
as
if
some
unpleasant
duty
had
forced
her
temporarily
into
purgatory
she
shied
round
like
a
cat
in
a
strange
garret
as
if
all
she
wanted
was
to
get
out
she
would
dance
she
would
talk
she
went
home
early
to
her
studies
i
suppose
and
her
plans
for
next
day
unmitigated
usefulness
she
took
it
for
granted
we
had
nothing
in
us
dance
and
so
as
artemus
ward
says
the
american
eagle
could
solace
itself
in
that
way
we
let
it
went
she
might
have
done
some
good
to
us
we
needed
to
be
done
to
i
do
doubt
but
it
all
over
now
that
light
is
under
a
bushel
and
that
city
hid
so
far
as
highslope
is
concerned
and
we
pretty
much
made
up
our
minds
among
us
to
be
bad
and
jolly
only
sometimes
i
get
thinking
that
all
she
got
up
giving
the
string
of
rings
a
final
whirl
and
tossing
them
into
leslie
goldthwaite
lap
she
said
shaking
down
her
flounces
it
time
for
me
to
go
and
assert
myself
at
shinar
moi
napoleon
was
great
when
he
said
that
a
great
deal
greater
than
if
he
pretended
to
be
meek
and
want
nothing
but
the
public
good
what
gets
crowded
out
day
by
day
that
is
the
great
test
of
our
life
just
now
everything
seemed
likely
to
get
crowded
out
with
the
young
folks
at
outledge
but
dresses
characters
and
rehearsals
the
swivel
the
earth
turned
on
at
this
moment
was
the
coming
tuesday
evening
and
its
performance
and
the
central
axis
of
that
to
nearly
every
individual
interest
was
what
such
particular
individual
was
to
be
they
had
asked
leslie
to
take
the
part
of
zorayda
in
the
three
moorish
princesses
of
the
alhambra
jeannie
and
elinor
were
to
be
zayda
and
zorahayda
as
for
leslie
she
liked
well
enough
as
we
know
to
look
pretty
it
was
or
had
been
till
other
thoughts
of
late
had
begun
to
crowd
it
out
something
like
a
besetting
weakness
she
had
only
lately
to
tell
the
whole
truth
as
it
seldom
is
told
begun
to
be
ashamed
before
her
higher
self
to
turn
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
with
a
certain
anxiety
toward
her
glass
to
see
how
she
was
looking
without
studying
into
separate
causes
of
complexion
and
so
forth
as
older
women
given
to
these
things
come
to
do
she
knew
that
somehow
there
was
often
a
difference
and
beside
the
standing
question
in
her
mind
as
to
whether
there
were
a
chance
of
her
growing
up
to
anything
like
positive
beauty
or
not
there
was
apt
often
to
be
a
reason
why
she
would
like
if
possible
to
be
in
particular
good
looks
when
she
got
an
invitation
or
an
excursion
was
planned
the
first
thing
that
came
into
her
head
was
naturally
what
she
should
wear
and
a
good
deal
of
the
pleasure
would
depend
on
that
a
party
without
an
especially
pretty
dress
did
amount
to
much
she
could
help
that
it
did
count
with
everybody
and
it
made
a
difference
she
would
like
undoubtedly
a
pretty
part
in
these
tableaux
but
there
was
more
in
leslie
goldthwaite
even
without
touching
upon
the
deep
things
than
all
this
a
pretty
part
did
not
quite
satisfy
she
had
capacity
for
something
more
in
spite
of
the
lovely
moorish
costume
to
be
contrived
out
of
blue
silk
and
white
muslin
and
to
contrast
so
picturesquely
with
jeannie
crimson
and
the
soft
snowy
drapery
of
elinor
she
would
have
been
half
willing
to
be
the
discreet
kadiga
instead
for
the
old
woman
had
really
to
look
as
well
as
and
there
was
a
spirit
and
a
fun
in
that
the
pros
and
cons
and
possibilities
were
working
themselves
gradually
clear
to
her
thoughts
as
she
sat
and
listened
with
external
attention
in
the
beginning
to
sin
saxon
chatter
ideas
about
the
adaptation
of
her
and
the
character
she
could
bring
out
of
or
get
into
her
part
mingled
themselves
together
and
irving
delicious
old
legend
that
she
had
read
hundreds
of
times
entranced
as
a
child
repeated
itself
in
snatches
to
her
recollection
jeannie
must
be
stately
that
would
quite
suit
her
elinor
must
just
be
elinor
then
the
airs
and
graces
remained
for
herself
she
thought
she
could
illustrate
with
some
spirit
the
latent
coquetry
of
the
imprisoned
beauty
she
believed
notwithstanding
the
fashion
in
which
the
story
measured
out
their
speech
in
rations
always
an
appropriate
bit
and
just
so
much
of
it
to
each
that
the
gay
zorayda
must
have
had
the
principal
hand
in
their
affairs
must
have
put
the
others
up
to
mischief
and
coaxed
most
winningly
the
discreet
kadiga
she
could
make
something
out
of
it
it
should
be
mere
flat
prettiness
she
began
to
congratulate
herself
upon
the
character
and
then
her
ingenious
fancy
flew
off
to
something
else
that
had
occurred
to
her
and
that
she
had
only
secretly
proposed
to
sin
saxon
an
illustration
of
a
certain
ancient
nursery
ballad
to
vary
by
contrast
the
pathetic
representations
of
auld
robin
gray
and
the
lady
of
shalott
it
was
a
bright
plan
and
she
was
nearly
sure
she
could
carry
it
out
but
it
was
not
a
pretty
part
and
sin
saxon
had
thought
it
fair
she
should
have
one
therefore
zorayda
all
this
was
reason
why
leslie
brain
was
busy
like
her
fingers
as
she
sat
and
sewed
on
the
green
curtain
and
let
sin
saxon
talk
till
miss
craydocke
said
that
something
always
gets
crowded
out
and
so
those
words
came
to
her
in
the
midst
of
all
the
josselyns
went
away
to
their
own
room
when
the
last
rings
had
been
sewn
on
and
the
curtain
was
ready
as
had
been
promised
at
ten
leslie
stayed
waiting
for
dakie
thayne
to
come
and
fetch
it
while
she
sat
there
silent
by
the
window
miss
craydocke
brought
out
a
new
armful
of
something
from
a
drawer
and
came
and
placed
her
shaker
beside
her
leslie
looked
around
and
saw
her
lap
full
of
two
little
bright
plaid
dresses
it
only
the
buttonholes
said
miss
craydocke
i
going
to
make
them
now
before
they
find
me
out
leslie
looked
very
uncomprehending
you
did
suppose
i
let
those
girls
come
in
here
and
spend
their
morning
on
that
nonsense
for
nothing
did
you
this
is
some
of
work
the
work
that
crowding
all
the
frolic
out
of
their
lives
found
out
where
they
keep
it
and
i
stolen
some
i
scotch
you
know
and
i
believe
in
brownies
they
good
to
believe
in
old
fables
are
generally
true
you
only
to
in
one
to
make
it
so
as
children
say
in
and
even
and
miss
craydocke
overcasted
her
first
buttonhole
energetically
leslie
goldthwaite
saw
through
the
whole
now
in
a
minute
you
did
it
on
purpose
for
an
excuse
she
said
and
there
was
a
ring
of
applauding
delight
in
her
voice
which
a
note
of
admiration
poorly
marks
well
you
must
begin
somehow
said
miss
craydocke
and
after
once
begun
you
can
keep
on
which
as
a
generality
was
not
so
glittering
perhaps
as
might
be
but
leslie
could
imagine
with
a
warm
what
in
this
case
miss
craydocke
keeping
on
would
be
i
found
them
out
by
degrees
said
miss
craydocke
they
been
overhead
here
this
month
nearly
and
if
you
listen
nor
look
more
than
is
you
ca
help
scraps
enough
to
piece
something
out
of
by
that
time
they
sit
by
their
window
and
i
sit
by
mine
i
cough
and
sneeze
and
sing
as
much
as
i
find
comfortable
and
they
ca
help
knowing
where
their
neighbors
are
and
after
that
it
their
lookout
of
course
i
lent
them
some
books
one
sunday
and
so
we
got
on
a
sort
of
visiting
terms
and
lately
i
gone
in
sometimes
and
sat
down
awhile
when
i
had
an
errand
and
they
been
here
the
amount
of
it
is
they
two
young
things
that
grow
old
before
they
know
they
ever
been
young
if
somebody
do
take
hold
they
only
got
just
so
much
time
to
stay
and
if
we
do
contrive
a
holiday
for
them
before
it
over
why
there
the
that
all
dakie
thayne
came
to
the
door
to
fetch
leslie
and
the
curtain
it
all
ready
dakie
here
but
i
ca
go
just
now
not
unless
they
want
me
much
and
then
you
come
please
wo
you
and
let
me
know
again
said
leslie
bundling
up
the
mass
of
cambric
and
piling
it
upon
dakie
arms
dakie
looked
disappointed
but
promised
and
departed
they
were
finding
him
useful
upstairs
and
leslie
had
begged
him
to
help
now
give
me
that
other
dress
she
said
turning
to
miss
craydocke
and
you
could
you
go
and
steal
something
else
she
spoke
impetuously
and
her
eyes
shone
with
eagerness
and
more
i
had
to
lay
a
plan
resumed
miss
craydocke
as
leslie
took
the
measure
of
a
buttonhole
and
began
change
of
work
is
as
good
as
a
rest
so
i
had
them
down
here
on
the
curtain
among
the
girls
next
going
to
have
a
bee
i
got
some
things
to
finish
up
for
prissy
hoskins
and
they
likely
to
be
wanted
in
something
of
a
hurry
got
another
aunt
in
portsmouth
and
if
she
can
only
be
provided
with
proper
things
to
wear
she
can
go
down
there
aunt
hoskins
says
and
stay
all
winter
get
some
schooling
and
see
a
city
doctor
the
man
here
tells
them
that
something
might
be
done
for
her
hearing
by
a
person
skilled
in
such
things
and
miss
hoskins
says
a
little
money
of
the
child
own
from
the
vandoo
when
her
father
died
that
would
pay
for
traveling
and
advice
and
the
right
sort
ai
to
be
had
in
portsmouth
when
she
once
gets
started
she
shall
go
is
if
she
has
to
have
a
vandoo
herself
it
a
whole
human
life
of
comfort
and
usefulness
leslie
goldthwaite
may
be
that
depends
well
have
a
bee
and
get
prissy
fixed
out
her
portsmouth
aunt
is
coming
up
and
will
take
her
back
she
give
her
a
welcome
but
she
poor
herself
and
ca
afford
much
more
and
then
the
josselyns
are
to
have
a
bee
not
everybody
but
you
and
me
and
we
see
by
that
time
who
else
it
to
begin
as
if
we
meant
to
have
them
all
round
for
the
frolic
and
the
sociability
and
besides
that
we
steal
all
we
can
for
your
part
you
must
get
intimate
nobody
can
do
anything
except
as
a
friend
and
the
last
week
they
here
is
the
very
week
i
going
everywhere
in
i
going
to
charter
the
little
red
and
have
parties
of
my
own
we
have
a
picnic
at
the
cliff
and
prissy
will
wait
on
us
with
raspberries
and
cream
we
walk
up
and
ride
up
giant
cairn
and
we
have
a
sunset
at
minster
rock
and
it
going
to
be
pleasant
weather
every
day
they
stitched
away
then
dropping
their
talk
miss
craydocke
was
out
of
breath
and
leslie
measured
her
even
loops
with
eyes
that
glittered
more
and
more
the
buttonholes
apiece
were
completed
and
then
miss
craydocke
trotted
off
with
the
two
little
frocks
upon
her
arm
she
came
back
bringing
some
two
or
three
pairs
of
drawers
i
took
them
up
just
as
they
lay
cut
out
and
ready
on
the
bed
i
would
have
a
word
i
told
them
i
nothing
to
do
and
so
i
have
my
hurry
is
coming
on
all
of
a
sudden
when
i
have
my
bee
now
i
done
it
once
i
can
do
it
again
they
find
out
it
my
way
and
when
you
once
set
up
a
way
people
always
turn
out
for
it
miss
craydocke
was
in
high
glee
leslie
stitched
up
three
little
legs
before
dakie
came
again
and
said
they
must
have
her
upstairs
one
thing
occurred
to
her
as
they
ran
along
the
winding
passages
up
and
down
and
up
again
to
the
new
hall
in
the
the
moorish
dress
would
take
so
long
to
arrange
would
imogen
thoresby
like
the
part
she
was
only
in
the
three
fishers
imogen
and
jeannie
met
her
as
she
came
in
it
is
just
you
i
wanted
to
find
cried
leslie
sealing
her
warm
impulse
with
immediate
act
will
you
be
zorayda
imogen
with
jeannie
and
elinor
you
know
i
got
so
much
to
do
without
sin
saxon
understands
it
a
bit
of
a
secret
as
yet
i
shall
be
obliged
imogen
blue
eyes
sparkled
and
widened
it
was
just
what
she
had
been
secretly
longing
for
but
why
in
the
world
should
leslie
goldthwaite
want
to
give
it
up
it
had
got
crowded
out
that
was
all
another
thing
kept
coming
into
leslie
head
that
day
the
yards
of
delicate
that
she
had
hemstitched
and
knotted
into
bands
that
summer
just
for
idle
work
when
plain
bindings
and
simple
ruffling
would
have
done
as
well
and
all
for
her
accumulating
treasure
of
reserved
robings
while
here
were
these
two
girls
darning
stockings
and
sewing
over
heavy
woollen
stuffs
that
actual
inevitable
work
might
be
dispatched
in
these
bright
warm
hours
that
had
been
meant
for
holiday
it
troubled
her
to
think
of
it
seeing
that
the
time
was
gone
and
nothing
now
but
these
threads
and
holes
remained
of
it
to
her
share
martha
josselyn
had
asked
her
yesterday
about
the
stitch
some
little
she
had
thought
of
for
the
mother
who
could
afford
embroideries
and
for
her
youngest
and
least
of
so
many
leslie
would
go
and
show
her
and
as
miss
craydocke
said
get
intimate
it
was
true
there
were
certain
little
things
one
could
not
do
except
as
a
friend
meanwhile
martha
josselyn
must
be
the
sister
of
charity
in
that
lovely
tableau
of
consolation
it
does
not
take
long
for
two
young
girls
to
grow
intimate
over
tableau
plans
and
fancy
stitches
two
days
after
this
leslie
goldthwaite
was
as
cosily
established
in
the
josselyns
room
as
if
she
had
been
there
every
day
all
summer
some
people
like
drops
of
quicksilver
as
martha
josselyn
had
declared
only
one
ca
tell
how
that
is
till
one
gets
out
of
the
bottle
thank
you
she
said
to
leslie
as
she
mastered
the
little
intricacy
of
the
work
upon
the
experimental
scrap
of
cambric
she
had
drawn
i
understand
it
now
i
think
and
i
shall
find
time
somehow
after
i
get
home
for
what
i
want
to
do
with
that
she
laid
it
in
a
corner
of
her
basket
and
took
up
again
leslie
put
something
twisted
lightly
in
soft
paper
beside
it
i
want
you
to
keep
that
please
for
a
pattern
and
to
remember
me
she
said
i
made
yards
more
than
i
really
want
it
nothing
she
added
hastily
interrupting
the
surprised
and
remonstrating
thanks
of
the
other
and
now
we
must
see
about
that
scapulary
thing
or
whatever
it
is
for
your
nun
dress
and
there
was
no
more
about
it
only
an
unusual
feeling
in
martha
josselyn
heart
that
came
up
warm
long
after
and
by
and
by
a
little
difference
among
leslie
goldthwaite
pretty
garnishings
where
something
had
got
crowded
out
this
is
the
way
from
small
to
great
things
sort
themselves
no
man
can
serve
two
masters
is
as
full
and
true
and
strong
upon
the
side
of
encouragement
as
of
rebuke
chapter
xiii
a
howl
the
tableaux
had
to
be
put
off
frank
scherman
was
obliged
to
go
down
to
boston
unexpectedly
to
attend
to
business
and
nothing
could
be
done
without
him
the
young
girls
felt
all
the
reaction
that
comes
with
the
sudden
interruption
of
eager
plans
a
stagnation
seemed
to
succeed
to
their
excitement
and
energy
they
were
thrown
back
into
a
vacuum
there
is
nothing
on
earth
to
do
or
to
think
about
said
florrie
arnall
dolefully
just
as
much
as
there
was
last
week
replied
josie
scherman
frank
was
only
her
brother
and
that
made
a
difference
there
giant
cairn
as
big
as
ever
and
and
minster
rock
and
the
spires
and
there
plenty
to
do
tableaux
everything
there
your
sin
saxon
that
has
come
off
yet
is
the
fall
that
hurts
it
the
as
the
irishman
observed
said
sin
saxon
with
a
yawn
it
was
that
i
doted
particularly
on
the
tableaux
but
waters
wild
went
my
child
and
i
was
left
lamenting
it
was
what
i
happened
to
be
after
at
the
moment
when
i
get
ready
for
a
go
i
do
hate
to
take
off
my
bonnet
and
sit
down
at
home
but
the
sin
what
to
become
of
that
ai
i
howling
all
i
can
and
this
was
all
sin
saxon
would
say
about
it
the
girls
meant
to
keep
her
in
mind
and
to
have
their
frolic
the
half
of
them
in
the
most
imaginative
ignorance
as
to
what
it
might
prove
to
be
but
somehow
their
leader
herself
seemed
to
have
lost
her
enthusiasm
or
her
intention
leslie
goldthwaite
felt
neither
disappointment
nor
impatience
she
had
got
a
permanent
interest
it
is
good
always
to
have
something
to
fall
back
upon
the
tableaux
would
come
by
and
by
meanwhile
there
was
plenty
of
time
for
their
bees
and
for
the
cliff
they
had
long
mornings
in
the
pines
and
cool
quiet
afternoons
in
miss
craydocke
pretty
room
it
was
wonderful
the
cleverness
the
josselyns
had
come
to
with
little
frocks
one
a
skirt
and
the
other
a
body
they
made
nothing
of
finishing
the
whole
at
a
sitting
it
only
seeing
the
end
from
the
beginning
martha
said
when
leslie
uttered
her
astonishment
we
know
the
way
right
through
and
no
way
seems
long
when
you
traveled
it
often
to
be
sure
prissy
delaines
and
calicoes
did
need
to
be
contrived
after
then
they
had
their
holiday
taking
the
things
over
to
the
cliff
and
trying
them
all
on
prissy
very
much
as
if
they
had
been
a
party
of
children
and
she
a
paper
doll
her
rosy
little
face
and
willful
curls
came
out
of
each
prettier
than
the
last
precisely
as
a
paper
does
and
when
at
the
end
of
all
they
got
her
into
a
bright
violet
print
and
a
white
it
was
well
they
were
the
last
for
they
have
had
the
heart
to
take
her
out
of
them
leslie
had
made
for
her
a
small
hoop
from
the
upper
half
of
one
of
her
own
and
laced
a
little
cover
upon
it
of
striped
seersucker
of
which
there
was
a
petticoat
also
to
wear
above
these
clear
clean
and
stiffened
came
from
miss
craydocke
stores
she
never
traveled
without
her
wherein
put
at
once
in
perfect
readiness
for
different
use
the
moment
they
passed
beyond
her
own
she
kept
all
spare
material
that
waited
for
such
call
breadths
of
old
dresses
ripped
and
sponged
and
pressed
or
starched
ironed
and
folded
flannel
petticoats
shrunken
short
stockings
cut
down
in
the
old
thrifty
grandmother
fashion
underclothing
strongly
patched
as
she
said
the
lord
mark
put
upon
it
since
it
had
pleased
him
to
give
her
the
means
to
do
without
patches
odds
and
ends
of
dipped
in
spirits
and
rolled
tightly
upon
blocks
from
which
they
unrolled
nearly
as
good
as
new
all
these
things
and
more
religiously
made
the
most
of
for
whomsoever
they
might
first
benefit
went
about
with
her
in
this
the
biggest
of
her
boxes
which
give
out
from
it
as
she
might
she
never
seemed
she
said
to
get
quite
to
the
bottom
of
under
the
rounded
skirts
below
the
short
plain
trousers
ankles
and
feet
were
made
shapely
with
white
stockings
and
new
stout
boots
aunt
hoskins
believed
in
white
stockin
or
go
athout
an
bleachin
an
comin
out
new
none
o
yer
aggravations
everlastin
and
one
thing
more
the
prettiest
of
all
a
great
net
of
silk
that
leslie
had
begged
linceford
who
liked
netting
to
make
gathered
into
strong
large
meshes
the
unruly
wealth
of
hair
brushed
back
in
rippling
lines
from
temples
and
showing
so
its
brighter
natural
color
from
underneath
where
the
outside
had
grown
i
just
like
cinderella
with
four
godmothers
cried
the
child
and
she
danced
up
and
down
as
leslie
let
her
go
from
under
her
hands
you
just
like
a
little
heathen
screamed
aunt
hoskins
yer
thanks
her
own
thanks
spoke
themselves
partly
in
an
hysterical
sort
of
chuckle
and
sniffle
that
stopped
each
other
short
and
the
rebuke
with
them
but
there
she
do
know
no
better
ai
fer
every
day
you
need
think
it
for
company
an
fer
sundays
an
to
go
to
portsmouth
do
spoil
it
for
her
miss
hoskins
children
hate
to
think
it
for
every
day
said
leslie
goldthwaite
but
the
to
that
was
also
ready
i
do
care
cried
prissy
a
great
long
day
and
for
ever
and
ever
and
portsmouth
be
always
yer
stop
ter
kerchy
and
say
massy
i
donno
what
to
ye
ter
say
and
miss
hoskins
sniffled
and
gurgled
again
and
gave
it
up
she
has
thanked
us
i
think
said
miss
craydocke
in
her
simple
way
when
she
called
us
godmothers
the
word
came
home
to
her
good
heart
god
had
given
her
the
lonely
woman
the
larger
motherhood
brothers
and
sisters
and
mothers
she
thought
how
christ
traced
out
the
relationships
and
claimed
them
even
to
himself
now
for
once
to
be
done
up
that
general
order
number
two
miss
craydocke
said
to
the
josselyn
girls
as
they
all
first
met
together
again
after
the
cliff
party
we
worked
together
till
friends
and
so
there
not
a
word
to
be
said
we
owe
you
time
that
we
taken
and
more
that
we
mean
to
take
before
you
go
i
tell
you
what
for
when
it
necessary
it
was
a
nicer
matter
to
get
the
josselyns
to
be
helped
than
to
help
it
was
not
easy
for
them
to
bring
forth
their
breadths
and
their
linings
and
their
braids
that
were
to
be
pieced
and
their
trimmings
that
were
to
be
turned
and
to
lay
bare
to
other
eyes
all
their
little
economies
of
contrivance
but
miss
craydocke
managed
it
by
simple
straightforwardness
by
not
behaving
as
if
there
were
anything
to
be
glossed
over
or
ignored
instead
of
hushing
up
about
economies
she
brought
them
forward
and
gave
them
a
most
cheery
and
comfortable
not
to
say
dignified
air
it
was
all
ordinary
matter
of
course
the
way
everybody
did
or
ought
to
do
this
was
the
freshest
end
of
this
breadth
and
should
go
down
this
other
had
a
darn
that
might
be
cut
across
and
a
straight
piecing
made
for
which
the
slope
of
the
skirt
would
allow
should
do
it
so
that
hem
might
be
taken
off
altogether
and
a
new
one
turned
this
was
a
very
nice
trimming
and
plenty
of
it
and
the
wrong
side
was
brighter
than
the
right
she
knew
a
way
of
joining
worsted
braid
that
never
showed
you
might
have
a
dozen
pieces
in
the
binding
of
a
skirt
and
not
be
noticed
this
little
blue
frock
had
no
trimming
they
would
finish
that
at
home
no
the
prettiest
thing
in
the
world
for
it
would
be
pipings
of
black
silk
and
miss
craydocke
had
some
bits
just
right
for
covering
cord
thick
as
a
board
big
enough
for
nothing
else
and
out
they
came
as
did
many
another
thing
without
remark
from
her
bags
and
baskets
she
had
hooks
and
eyes
and
when
these
gave
out
she
used
from
her
own
and
skeins
of
silk
she
had
tailors
twist
for
buttonholes
and
large
black
cord
for
the
pipings
and
these
were
but
working
implements
like
scissors
and
thimble
taken
for
granted
without
count
there
was
nothing
on
the
surface
for
the
most
shrinking
delicacy
to
rub
against
but
there
was
a
kindness
that
went
down
into
the
hearts
of
the
two
young
girls
continually
for
an
hour
or
two
at
least
each
day
they
sat
together
so
for
the
being
together
the
work
was
taken
up
dakie
thayne
read
stories
to
them
sometimes
miss
craydocke
had
something
always
to
produce
and
to
summon
them
to
sit
and
hear
some
sketch
of
strange
adventure
or
a
ghost
marvel
or
a
bright
spicy
magazine
essay
or
knowing
where
to
find
sympathizers
and
helpers
dakie
would
rush
in
upon
them
uncalled
with
some
discovery
or
want
or
beautiful
thing
to
show
of
his
own
they
were
quite
a
little
coterie
by
themselves
it
shaped
itself
to
this
more
and
more
leslie
did
not
neglect
her
own
party
she
drove
and
walked
with
linceford
and
was
ready
for
anything
the
haddens
really
wanted
of
her
but
linceford
napped
and
lounged
a
good
deal
and
could
spare
her
then
and
jeannie
and
elinor
seemed
somehow
to
feel
the
want
of
her
less
than
they
had
done
elinor
unconsciously
drawn
away
by
new
attraction
jeannie
rather
of
a
purpose
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
call
it
anything
else
but
a
little
loss
of
caste
which
seemed
coming
to
leslie
goldthwaite
just
now
through
these
new
intimacies
of
hers
something
always
gets
crowded
out
this
too
her
popularity
among
the
first
might
have
to
be
perhaps
one
of
the
somethings
now
and
then
she
felt
it
so
perceived
the
shade
of
difference
toward
her
in
the
tone
and
manner
of
these
young
girls
i
can
not
say
that
it
did
not
hurt
her
a
little
she
had
of
course
yet
for
all
she
was
loyal
to
the
more
generous
love
to
the
truer
if
she
could
not
have
both
she
would
keep
the
best
there
came
to
be
a
little
pride
in
her
own
demeanor
a
waiting
to
be
sought
again
i
ca
think
what
has
come
over
les
said
jeannie
hadden
one
night
on
the
piazza
to
a
knot
of
girls
she
spoke
in
a
tone
at
once
apologetic
and
annoyed
she
was
always
up
to
anything
at
home
i
thought
she
meant
to
lead
us
all
off
here
she
might
have
done
almost
what
she
pleased
everybody
likes
leslie
said
elinor
why
yes
we
all
do
put
in
mattie
shannon
only
she
will
take
up
queer
people
you
see
and
well
they
nice
enough
i
suppose
only
there
never
room
enough
for
everybody
i
thought
we
were
all
to
be
nowhere
when
she
first
came
there
was
something
about
her
i
do
know
what
not
wonderful
but
taking
her
where
you
pleased
she
was
the
central
point
of
the
picture
frank
said
this
came
from
josie
scherman
and
she
just
dropped
all
to
run
after
goodness
knows
what
and
whom
i
ca
see
through
her
rejoined
jeannie
with
a
sort
of
finality
in
her
accent
that
seemed
to
imply
wash
my
hands
of
her
and
wo
be
supposed
accountable
knew
ye
not
broke
in
a
gentle
voice
that
she
must
be
about
her
master
business
it
was
scarcely
addressed
to
them
miss
craydocke
just
breathed
audibly
the
thought
she
could
not
help
there
came
a
downfall
of
silence
upon
the
group
when
they
took
breath
again
oh
if
she
mattie
shannon
just
said
as
of
a
thing
yet
farther
off
and
more
finally
done
with
and
then
their
talk
waited
under
a
restraint
again
i
supposed
we
were
all
religious
sundays
at
least
broke
forth
sin
saxon
suddenly
who
strangely
had
not
spoken
before
i
do
know
though
last
saturday
night
we
danced
the
german
till
half
past
twelve
and
we
talked
charades
instead
of
going
to
church
till
i
felt
as
if
i
sat
all
the
morning
with
my
feet
over
a
register
reading
a
novel
when
i
ought
to
have
been
doing
a
german
exercise
or
something
if
she
religious
every
day
she
seven
times
better
than
we
are
all
think
she
got
a
knot
to
her
thread
nobody
dared
send
leslie
goldthwaite
quite
to
coventry
after
this
sin
saxon
found
herself
in
the
position
of
many
another
leader
obliged
to
make
some
demonstration
to
satisfy
the
aroused
expectations
of
her
followers
her
heart
was
no
longer
thoroughly
in
it
but
she
had
promised
them
a
howl
and
a
howl
they
were
determined
upon
either
with
or
against
her
opportunity
arose
just
now
also
madam
routh
went
off
on
a
party
to
the
notch
with
some
new
york
friends
taking
with
her
one
or
two
of
the
younger
pupils
for
whom
she
felt
most
constant
responsibility
the
elder
girls
were
domesticated
and
acquainted
now
at
outledge
there
were
several
matronly
ladies
with
whom
the
whole
party
was
sufficiently
associated
in
daily
intercourse
for
all
the
air
of
chaperonage
that
might
be
needed
and
one
assistant
pupil
whom
to
be
sure
the
young
ladies
themselves
counted
as
a
most
convenient
nonentity
was
left
in
nominal
charge
now
or
never
the
girls
declared
with
one
voice
it
must
be
all
they
knew
about
it
the
most
of
them
was
that
it
was
some
sort
of
an
frolic
such
as
delight
in
and
it
was
to
plague
miss
craydocke
against
whom
by
this
time
they
had
none
of
them
really
any
manner
of
spite
neither
had
they
any
longer
the
idea
of
forcing
her
to
evacuate
but
they
had
got
wound
up
on
that
key
at
the
beginning
and
nobody
thought
of
changing
it
nobody
but
sin
saxon
she
had
begun
perhaps
to
have
a
little
feeling
that
she
would
change
it
if
she
could
nevertheless
with
such
show
of
heartiness
as
she
found
possible
she
assented
to
their
demand
and
the
time
was
fixed
her
merry
mischievous
temperament
asserted
itself
as
she
went
on
until
she
really
grew
into
the
mood
for
it
once
more
from
the
pure
fun
of
the
thing
it
took
two
days
to
get
ready
after
the
german
on
thursday
night
the
howl
was
announced
to
come
off
in
number
thirteen
west
wing
this
of
course
was
the
boudoir
but
nobody
but
the
initiated
knew
that
it
was
supposed
to
be
maud
walcott
room
the
assistant
pupil
made
faint
remonstrances
against
she
knew
not
what
and
was
politely
told
so
moreover
she
was
pressingly
invited
to
render
herself
with
the
other
guests
at
the
little
piazza
door
precisely
at
eleven
the
matronly
ladies
always
amused
sometimes
a
little
annoyed
and
scandalized
at
sin
saxon
escapades
asked
her
one
and
another
at
different
times
what
it
was
all
to
be
and
if
she
really
thought
she
had
better
and
among
themselves
expressed
tolerably
grave
doubts
about
proprieties
and
wished
madam
routh
would
return
the
vague
mystery
and
excitement
of
the
howl
kept
all
the
house
gently
agog
for
this
tuesday
and
wednesday
intervening
sin
saxon
gave
out
odd
hints
here
and
there
in
confidence
it
was
to
be
a
spread
and
the
grub
sin
was
a
girl
you
know
and
had
brothers
in
college
was
all
to
be
stolen
there
was
an
uncommon
clearance
of
cakes
and
doughnuts
and
pie
and
cheese
from
each
meal
at
this
time
even
disappeared
cups
and
all
a
cold
supper
laid
at
nine
on
wednesday
evening
for
some
expected
travelers
turned
out
a
more
meagre
provision
on
the
arrival
of
the
guests
than
the
good
host
of
the
giant
cairn
had
ever
been
known
to
make
at
bedtime
sin
saxon
presented
herself
in
miss
craydocke
room
there
something
heavy
on
my
conscience
she
said
with
a
disquiet
air
i
really
worried
and
it
too
late
to
help
it
now
miss
craydocke
looked
at
her
with
a
kind
anxiety
it
never
too
late
to
to
help
a
mistake
and
miss
saxon
you
can
always
do
what
you
choose
she
was
afraid
for
her
the
good
lady
that
her
heedlessness
might
compromise
herself
and
others
in
some
untoward
scrape
she
did
like
these
rumors
of
the
howl
the
last
thing
she
thought
of
being
her
own
rest
and
comfort
which
were
to
be
purposely
invaded
i
let
the
chance
go
by
said
sin
saxon
desperately
it
of
no
use
now
and
she
rocked
herself
back
and
forth
in
the
shaker
chair
of
which
she
had
taken
possession
my
dear
said
miss
craydocke
if
you
would
only
explain
to
me
perhaps
you
cried
sin
jumping
up
and
making
a
rush
at
the
good
woman
seizing
her
by
both
hands
they
never
suspect
you
it
that
cold
roast
chicken
in
the
pantry
i
get
over
it
that
i
take
that
sin
was
incorrigible
miss
craydocke
shook
her
head
taking
care
to
turn
it
aside
at
the
same
moment
for
she
felt
her
lips
twitch
and
her
eyes
twinkle
in
spite
of
herself
i
wo
take
this
till
the
time
comes
said
sin
laying
her
hand
on
the
back
of
the
shaker
chair
but
it
confiscated
for
night
and
i
shall
come
for
it
and
miss
craydocke
if
you
manage
about
the
chicken
i
hate
to
trouble
you
to
go
downstairs
but
i
dare
say
you
want
matches
or
a
drink
of
water
or
something
and
another
time
wait
upon
you
with
pleasure
here
the
door
made
for
the
emergency
and
i
on
the
other
side
of
it
dissolved
in
tears
of
gratitude
and
so
for
the
time
sin
saxon
disappeared
the
next
afternoon
jimmy
wigley
brought
a
big
basket
of
raspberries
to
the
little
piazza
door
a
pitcher
of
cream
vanished
from
the
just
before
the
gong
was
struck
nobody
supposed
the
cat
had
got
it
the
people
of
the
house
understood
pretty
well
what
was
going
on
and
who
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
but
madam
routh
party
was
large
and
the
life
of
the
place
they
would
wink
hard
and
long
before
complaining
at
anything
that
might
be
done
in
the
west
wing
sin
saxon
opened
her
door
upon
miss
craydocke
when
she
was
dressed
for
the
german
and
about
to
go
downstairs
i
trust
you
she
said
about
the
you
want
it
perhaps
till
bedtime
and
then
you
just
put
it
in
here
i
should
like
to
disturb
you
by
coming
for
it
late
and
please
step
in
a
minute
now
wo
you
she
took
her
through
the
boudoir
there
lay
the
spread
upon
a
long
table
contrived
by
the
contribution
of
one
ordinary
little
one
from
each
and
covered
by
a
pair
of
clean
sheets
which
swept
the
floor
along
the
sides
about
it
were
ranged
chairs
two
pyramids
of
candles
built
up
ingeniously
by
the
grouping
of
bedroom
tins
upon
hidden
supports
and
mosses
serving
gracefully
for
concealment
and
decoration
stood
one
on
each
side
half
way
between
the
ends
and
centre
were
garnished
with
wreathed
and
in
the
midst
a
great
white
indian
basket
held
the
red
berries
fresh
and
fragrant
that
the
little
bit
of
righteousness
to
save
the
city
that
paid
for
said
sin
saxon
jimmy
wigley
gone
home
with
more
scrip
than
he
ever
got
at
once
before
and
if
your
had
taken
the
wrong
direction
miss
craydocke
i
should
be
perfectly
at
ease
in
my
mind
it
very
pretty
said
miss
craydocke
but
do
you
think
madam
routh
would
quite
approve
and
why
could
you
have
had
it
openly
in
the
and
what
do
you
call
it
a
for
miss
questions
came
softly
and
hesitatingly
as
her
doubts
came
the
little
festival
was
charming
but
for
the
way
and
place
oh
miss
craydocke
well
you
not
wicked
and
you
ca
be
supposed
to
know
but
you
must
take
my
word
for
it
that
if
it
was
tamed
down
the
game
would
be
worth
the
candle
and
the
howl
you
just
wait
and
see
the
invited
guests
were
told
to
come
to
the
little
piazza
door
the
girls
asked
all
their
partners
in
the
german
and
the
matronly
ladies
were
asked
as
a
good
many
respectable
people
are
civilly
invited
where
their
declining
is
counted
upon
leslie
goldthwaite
and
the
haddens
and
linceford
and
the
thoresbys
were
all
asked
and
might
come
if
they
chose
their
stay
would
be
another
matter
and
so
the
evening
and
the
german
went
on
till
eleven
when
they
broke
up
and
the
entertainers
in
a
body
rushed
merrily
and
noisily
along
the
passages
to
number
thirteen
west
wing
rousing
from
their
first
naps
many
quietly
disposed
delicate
people
who
kept
early
hours
and
a
few
babies
whose
nurses
and
mammas
would
bear
them
anything
but
gratefully
in
mind
through
the
midnight
hours
to
come
they
gained
two
minutes
perhaps
upon
their
guests
who
had
some
of
them
to
look
up
wraps
and
to
come
round
by
the
front
hall
and
piazzas
in
these
two
minutes
by
sin
saxon
order
they
seated
themselves
comfortably
at
table
they
had
plenty
of
room
but
they
spread
their
robes
gracefully
they
had
all
dressed
in
their
very
prettiest
and
they
quite
filled
up
the
space
bright
colors
and
soft
rich
textures
floating
and
mingling
together
were
like
a
rainbow
encircling
the
feast
the
candles
had
been
touched
with
kerosene
and
matches
lay
ready
the
had
been
done
in
an
instant
and
then
sin
saxon
went
to
the
door
and
drew
back
the
chintz
curtains
from
across
the
upper
half
which
was
of
glass
a
group
of
the
guests
young
men
were
already
there
beneath
the
elms
outside
but
how
should
she
see
them
looking
from
the
bright
light
into
the
she
went
quietly
back
and
took
her
place
at
the
head
leaving
the
door
fast
bolted
there
came
a
knock
sin
saxon
took
no
heed
but
smilingly
addressed
herself
to
offering
dainties
right
and
left
some
of
the
girls
stared
and
one
or
two
half
rose
to
go
and
give
admittance
keep
your
seats
said
sin
in
her
most
way
and
tone
with
the
unchanged
smile
upon
her
face
the
they
began
to
perceive
the
joke
outside
they
began
to
knock
vociferously
they
took
up
their
cue
with
a
readiness
and
made
plenty
of
noise
not
doubting
as
yet
that
they
should
be
admitted
at
last
some
of
the
ladies
came
round
gave
a
glance
saw
how
things
were
going
and
retreated
except
a
few
parties
from
other
houses
who
had
escorts
among
the
gentlemen
and
who
waited
a
little
to
see
how
the
frolic
would
end
or
at
least
to
reclaim
their
attendants
well
it
was
very
unpardonable
outrageous
the
scandalized
neighbors
were
beginning
already
to
say
in
their
rooms
even
sin
saxon
had
a
little
excitement
in
her
eye
beyond
the
fun
as
she
still
maintained
the
most
graceful
order
within
and
the
exchange
of
courtesies
went
on
around
the
board
and
the
tumult
increased
without
they
they
they
shouted
they
cheered
they
howled
they
even
hissed
sin
saxon
sat
motionless
an
instant
when
it
came
to
that
and
gave
a
glance
toward
the
lights
a
word
from
her
would
put
them
out
and
end
the
whole
she
held
her
in
reserve
however
knowing
her
resource
and
sat
as
it
were
with
her
finger
on
the
spring
determined
to
carry
through
coolly
what
she
had
begun
dakie
thayne
had
gone
away
with
the
linceford
party
when
they
crossed
to
the
green
cottage
afterward
he
came
out
again
and
stood
in
the
open
road
some
ladies
boarders
at
blashford
up
above
came
slowly
away
from
the
uproar
homeward
one
or
two
young
men
detached
themselves
from
the
group
on
the
piazza
and
followed
to
see
them
safe
as
it
belonged
to
them
to
do
the
rest
sat
themselves
down
at
this
moment
upon
the
steps
and
platform
and
struck
up
with
one
accord
we
wo
go
home
till
morning
in
the
midst
of
this
a
part
broke
off
and
took
up
discordantly
the
refrain
polly
put
the
kettle
on
we
all
have
tea
others
complicated
the
confusion
further
with
cruel
cruel
polly
hopkins
treat
me
so
oh
treat
me
so
till
they
fell
at
last
into
an
indistinguishable
jumble
and
clamor
from
which
extricated
themselves
now
and
again
and
prevailed
the
choruses
of
upidee
and
with
an
occasional
of
emphasis
given
upon
the
door
do
go
back
there
james
dakie
thayne
heard
a
voice
from
the
retiring
party
say
as
they
passed
him
it
disgraceful
the
house
wo
hold
sin
saxon
after
this
said
another
they
were
out
in
the
upper
hall
half
a
dozen
of
them
just
now
ringing
their
bells
and
calling
for
mr
biscombe
the
poor
man
do
know
who
to
side
with
he
do
want
to
lose
the
whole
west
wing
after
all
there
must
be
young
people
in
the
house
and
if
it
were
one
thing
it
would
be
another
it
only
a
few
fidgets
that
complain
they
hush
up
and
go
off
presently
and
the
whole
thing
will
be
a
joke
over
the
morning
after
everybody
had
a
little
sleep
the
singing
died
partially
away
just
then
and
some
growling
less
noisy
but
more
in
earnest
began
they
do
to
let
us
in
i
say
this
is
getting
rather
rough
it
only
to
smash
a
pane
of
glass
above
the
bolt
and
let
ourselves
in
why
should
we
we
invited
the
latent
was
very
near
developing
itself
in
these
young
gentlemen
but
irate
at
this
moment
a
wagon
came
whirling
down
the
road
around
the
ledges
dakie
thayne
caught
sight
of
the
two
white
leaders
recognized
them
and
flew
across
to
the
hotel
stop
cried
he
at
the
same
instant
a
figure
moved
hastily
away
from
behind
miss
craydocke
blinds
it
was
a
mercy
that
the
wagon
had
driven
around
to
the
front
hall
door
a
mercy
in
one
way
but
the
misfortune
was
that
the
within
knew
nothing
of
it
a
musical
laugh
quite
in
contrast
to
the
demonstrative
utterances
outside
had
just
broken
forth
in
response
to
one
of
sin
saxon
brightest
speeches
when
through
the
adjoining
apartment
came
suddenly
upon
them
the
apparition
of
the
spinster
miss
craydocke
went
straight
across
to
the
beleaguered
door
drew
the
bolt
and
threw
it
back
gently
young
gentlemen
draw
up
the
piazza
chairs
if
you
please
and
sit
down
said
she
lowe
brookhouse
here
are
plates
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
serve
your
friends
in
three
minutes
she
had
filled
and
passed
outward
half
a
dozen
saucers
of
fruit
and
sent
a
basket
of
cake
among
them
then
she
drew
a
seat
for
herself
and
began
to
eat
raspberries
it
was
all
done
so
quickly
they
were
so
either
taken
by
surprise
that
nobody
inside
or
out
or
delayed
her
by
a
word
it
was
hardly
done
when
a
knock
sounded
at
the
door
upon
the
passage
young
ladies
a
voice
called
madam
routh
she
and
her
friends
had
driven
down
from
the
notch
by
sunset
and
moonlight
nobody
had
said
anything
to
her
of
the
disturbance
when
she
came
in
her
arrival
had
rather
stopped
the
complaints
that
had
begun
for
people
are
not
malignant
after
all
as
a
general
thing
and
there
is
a
curious
propensity
in
human
nature
which
cools
off
indignation
even
at
the
greatest
crimes
just
as
the
culprit
is
likely
to
suffer
we
are
apt
to
check
the
foot
just
as
we
might
have
planted
it
upon
the
noxious
creature
and
to
let
off
great
state
criminals
on
parole
madam
routh
had
seen
the
bright
light
and
the
gathering
about
the
west
wing
she
had
caught
some
sounds
of
the
commotion
she
made
her
way
at
once
to
look
after
her
charge
sin
saxon
was
not
a
pupil
now
and
there
was
no
condign
punishment
actually
to
fear
but
her
heart
stood
still
a
second
for
all
that
and
she
realized
that
she
had
been
on
the
verge
of
an
awful
scrape
it
was
bad
enough
now
as
madam
routh
stood
there
gravely
silent
she
could
not
approve
she
was
amazed
to
see
miss
craydocke
present
countenancing
and
matronizing
but
miss
craydocke
present
and
it
altered
the
whole
face
of
affairs
her
eye
took
in
too
the
modification
of
the
room
quite
an
elegant
little
private
parlor
as
it
had
been
made
the
young
men
were
gathered
decorously
about
the
doorway
and
upon
the
platform
one
or
two
only
politely
assisting
within
they
had
taken
this
cue
as
readily
as
the
other
indeed
they
were
by
no
means
aware
that
this
was
not
the
issue
intended
from
the
beginning
long
as
the
joke
had
been
allowed
to
go
on
and
their
and
courtesy
had
been
instantly
restored
miss
craydocke
by
one
of
generous
presence
of
mind
had
achieved
an
instantaneous
change
in
the
position
and
given
an
absolutely
new
complexion
to
the
performance
it
is
late
young
ladies
was
all
madam
routh
remark
at
length
they
gave
up
their
german
early
on
purpose
it
was
a
little
surprise
they
planned
miss
craydocke
said
as
she
moved
to
meet
her
and
then
madam
routh
with
wise
considerate
dignity
took
cue
she
even
came
forward
to
the
table
and
accepted
a
little
fruit
stayed
five
minutes
perhaps
and
then
without
a
spoken
word
her
movement
to
go
broke
up
with
unmistakable
intent
the
party
fifteen
minutes
after
all
was
quiet
in
the
west
wing
but
sin
saxon
when
the
doors
closed
at
either
hand
and
the
girls
alone
were
left
around
the
fragments
of
their
feast
rushed
impetuously
across
toward
miss
craydocke
and
went
down
beside
her
on
her
knees
oh
you
dear
magnificent
old
christian
she
cried
out
and
laid
her
head
down
on
her
lap
with
little
sobs
half
laughter
and
half
tears
there
there
and
miss
craydocke
softly
patted
her
golden
hair
and
spoke
as
she
would
soothe
a
fretted
and
excited
child
next
morning
at
breakfast
sin
saxon
was
as
beautifully
ruffled
ratted
and
crimped
as
gay
as
bewitching
and
defiant
as
ever
seated
next
madam
routh
assiduously
devoted
to
her
in
the
little
attentions
of
the
meal
in
high
spirits
and
favor
even
saucily
alluding
across
the
table
to
howl
miss
craydocke
public
opinion
was
carried
by
storm
the
benison
of
sleep
had
laid
wrath
nobody
knew
that
an
hour
before
she
had
been
in
madam
room
making
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
transaction
and
disclosing
the
truth
of
miss
craydocke
magnanimous
and
tactful
interposition
confessing
that
without
this
she
had
been
at
her
wits
ends
how
to
put
a
stop
to
it
and
promising
like
a
sorry
child
to
behave
better
and
never
do
so
any
more
two
hours
later
she
came
meekly
to
miss
craydocke
room
where
the
bee
was
gathered
for
mere
companionship
with
chess
and
her
flourishes
all
laid
aside
her
very
hair
brushed
close
to
her
pretty
head
and
a
plain
gingham
dress
on
miss
craydocke
she
said
with
an
air
she
could
not
divest
of
a
little
comicality
but
with
an
earnestness
behind
it
shining
through
her
eyes
i
good
i
converted
i
want
some
to
sew
on
immediately
and
she
sat
down
folding
her
hands
waiting
miss
craydocke
laughed
i
do
know
i
afraid
i
have
anything
to
be
done
just
now
unless
i
cut
out
some
very
coarse
heavy
homespun
i
be
glad
if
you
would
beggars
must
be
choosers
but
if
they
might
i
should
say
it
was
the
very
thing
sackcloth
you
know
and
then
perhaps
the
ashes
might
be
excused
i
in
solemn
earnest
though
i
reformed
you
done
it
and
you
she
added
turning
round
short
on
leslie
goldthwaite
you
been
at
it
a
long
time
to
yourself
and
you
you
finished
it
last
night
it
been
like
the
casting
out
of
the
devils
in
scripture
they
always
give
a
howl
you
know
and
go
out
of
chapter
xiv
friends
of
mammon
sin
saxon
came
heart
and
soul
into
miss
craydocke
generous
and
delicate
plans
the
work
was
done
to
be
sure
the
third
trunk
that
had
been
full
of
old
winter
dresses
to
be
made
over
was
locked
upon
the
nice
little
completed
frocks
and
sacks
that
forestalled
the
care
and
hurry
of
fall
work
for
the
overburdened
mother
and
were
to
gladden
her
unexpecting
eyes
as
such
store
only
can
gladden
the
anxious
family
manager
who
feels
the
changeful
shortening
days
come
treading
with
their
speedy
demands
upon
the
very
skirts
of
long
golden
sunshiny
august
hours
susan
and
martha
josselyn
felt
on
their
part
as
only
busy
workers
feel
who
fasten
the
last
thread
or
dash
a
period
to
the
last
page
and
turn
around
to
breathe
the
breath
of
the
free
and
choose
for
once
and
for
a
while
what
they
shall
do
the
first
hour
of
this
freedom
rested
them
more
than
the
whole
six
weeks
that
they
had
been
getting
with
the
burden
still
upon
their
thought
and
always
waiting
for
their
hands
it
was
like
the
first
to
children
when
school
has
closed
and
books
are
brought
home
for
the
long
vacation
all
the
possible
delight
of
coming
weeks
is
distilled
to
one
delicious
drop
and
tasted
then
it
of
my
funeral
i
know
sin
saxon
said
to
miss
craydocke
i
only
an
helper
but
i
come
in
for
the
holiday
business
if
you
let
me
and
perhaps
after
all
that
more
in
my
line
everything
seemed
to
be
in
her
line
that
she
once
took
hold
of
she
had
little
private
consultations
with
miss
craydocke
it
to
be
your
party
to
but
it
shall
be
my
party
to
minster
rock
she
said
leave
that
to
me
please
now
the
howl
off
my
hands
i
feel
equal
to
anything
just
in
time
for
the
party
to
minster
rock
a
great
basket
and
box
from
home
arrived
for
sin
saxon
in
the
first
were
delicious
early
peaches
and
gold
wrapped
one
by
one
in
soft
paper
and
laid
among
fine
sawdust
early
pears
also
with
the
summer
incense
in
their
spiciness
greenhouse
grapes
white
and
amber
and
purple
the
other
held
delicate
cakes
and
confections
unknown
to
outledge
as
carefully
put
up
and
quite
fresh
and
unharmed
everything
comes
in
right
for
me
she
exclaimed
running
back
and
forth
to
miss
craydocke
with
new
and
more
charming
discoveries
as
she
excavated
not
a
word
did
she
say
of
the
letter
that
had
gone
down
from
her
four
days
before
asking
her
mother
for
these
things
and
to
send
her
some
money
for
a
party
she
told
her
that
she
would
rather
give
here
than
to
have
her
usual
summer
after
her
return
you
quite
eclipse
and
extinguish
my
poor
little
doings
said
miss
craydocke
admiring
and
rejoicing
all
the
while
as
genuinely
as
sin
herself
dear
miss
craydocke
cried
the
girl
if
i
thought
it
would
seem
like
that
i
would
send
and
tip
them
all
into
the
river
but
you
you
be
eclipsed
your
orbit
runs
too
high
above
ours
sin
saxon
brightness
and
independence
that
lapsed
so
easily
into
sauciness
and
made
it
so
hard
for
her
to
observe
the
mere
conventionalisms
of
respect
in
no
way
hindered
the
real
reverence
that
grew
in
her
toward
the
superiority
she
recognized
and
that
now
softened
her
tone
to
a
tenderness
of
humility
before
her
friend
there
was
a
grace
upon
her
in
these
days
that
all
saw
over
her
real
wit
and
native
vivacity
it
was
like
a
porcelain
shade
about
a
flame
one
could
look
at
it
and
be
glad
of
it
without
winking
the
brightness
was
all
there
but
there
was
a
difference
in
the
giving
forth
what
had
been
a
bit
and
bright
as
if
only
for
being
bright
and
for
dazzling
was
outgoing
and
and
so
softened
leslie
goldthwaite
read
by
it
a
new
answer
to
some
of
her
old
questions
what
harm
is
there
in
it
she
had
asked
herself
on
their
first
meeting
when
sin
saxon
overflow
of
merry
mischief
that
yet
did
no
special
or
obvious
good
made
her
so
taking
so
the
centre
of
whatever
group
into
which
she
came
afterward
when
running
to
its
height
this
spirit
showed
in
behavior
that
raised
misgivings
among
the
scrupulous
and
orderly
that
would
not
let
them
any
longer
be
wholly
amused
and
came
near
betraying
her
or
actually
did
betray
her
into
indecorums
beyond
excuse
or
countenance
leslie
had
felt
the
harm
and
begun
to
shrink
away
nothing
leaves
came
back
to
her
her
summer
thought
recurred
and
drew
to
itself
a
new
illustration
this
it
was
to
have
no
aim
but
to
rustle
and
flaunt
to
grow
leaves
continually
to
make
one
central
and
conspicuous
and
to
fill
great
space
but
now
among
these
very
leaves
gleamed
something
golden
and
glorious
something
was
ripening
suddenly
out
that
had
lain
unseen
in
its
greenness
the
time
of
figs
seemed
coming
sin
saxon
was
intent
upon
new
purpose
something
to
be
would
not
let
her
stand
upon
the
order
or
the
fashion
of
her
doing
she
forgot
her
little
airs
that
had
been
apt
to
detract
from
her
very
wit
and
leave
it
only
smartness
bright
things
came
to
her
and
she
uttered
and
acted
them
but
they
seemed
involuntary
and
only
on
the
way
she
could
not
help
herself
and
nobody
would
have
had
it
helped
she
was
still
sin
saxon
but
she
had
simply
told
the
truth
in
her
wayward
way
that
morning
miss
craydocke
had
done
it
with
her
kindly
patience
that
was
no
stupidity
her
simple
dignity
that
never
lowered
itself
and
that
therefore
could
not
be
lowered
and
her
quiet
continuance
in
generous
and
sin
saxon
was
different
she
was
won
to
a
perception
of
the
really
best
in
life
that
which
this
plain
old
spinster
with
her
scrap
of
lace
and
a
front
had
found
worth
living
for
after
the
golden
days
were
over
the
impulse
of
temperament
and
the
generosity
which
made
everything
instant
and
entire
with
her
acted
in
this
also
and
carried
her
full
over
to
an
enthusiasm
of
affectionate
coöperation
there
were
a
few
people
at
outledge
of
the
sort
who
having
once
made
up
their
minds
that
no
good
is
ever
to
come
out
of
nazareth
see
all
things
in
the
light
of
that
conviction
who
would
not
allow
the
praise
of
any
voluntary
amendment
to
this
tempering
and
new
direction
of
vivacity
it
was
time
she
was
put
down
they
said
and
they
were
glad
that
it
was
done
that
last
outbreak
had
finished
her
she
might
as
well
run
after
people
now
whom
she
had
never
noticed
before
it
was
plain
there
was
nothing
else
left
for
her
her
place
was
gone
and
her
reign
was
over
of
all
others
thoresby
insisted
upon
this
most
strongly
the
whole
had
considerably
subsided
madam
routh
held
a
tighter
rein
but
that
sin
saxon
had
a
place
and
a
power
still
she
found
ways
to
show
in
a
new
spirit
into
a
quiet
corner
of
the
skimming
her
way
with
the
dance
yet
in
her
feet
between
groups
of
staid
observers
she
came
straight
one
evening
from
a
bright
spirited
figure
of
the
german
and
stretched
her
hand
to
martha
josselyn
it
in
your
eyes
she
whispered
come
night
after
night
martha
josselyn
had
sat
there
with
the
in
her
ears
and
her
little
feet
that
had
had
one
merry
winter
training
before
the
war
and
many
a
home
practice
since
with
the
younger
ones
quivering
to
the
time
beneath
her
robes
and
seen
other
girls
chosen
out
and
led
away
young
matrons
and
little
children
even
taken
to
excursionize
between
the
figures
while
nobody
thought
of
her
i
might
be
ninety
or
a
cripple
she
said
to
her
sister
from
their
taking
for
granted
it
is
nothing
to
me
how
is
it
that
everything
goes
by
and
i
only
twenty
there
had
been
danger
that
martha
josselyn
sweet
generous
temper
should
get
a
dash
of
sour
only
because
of
there
lying
alongside
it
a
clear
and
a
pure
instinct
of
justice
susan
heart
longed
with
a
motherly
tenderness
for
her
young
sister
when
she
said
such
words
longed
to
put
all
pleasant
things
somehow
within
her
reach
she
had
given
it
up
for
herself
years
since
and
now
all
at
once
sin
saxon
came
and
took
her
out
it
was
a
more
generous
act
than
it
shows
for
written
there
is
a
little
tacit
consent
about
such
things
which
few
young
people
of
a
set
have
thought
desire
or
courage
to
disregard
sin
saxon
never
did
anything
more
gracefully
it
was
one
of
the
moments
that
came
now
when
she
wist
not
that
she
shone
she
was
dropping
little
by
little
in
the
reality
of
a
better
desire
that
satisfaction
jeannie
hadden
had
spoken
of
of
knowing
when
one
is
at
one
prettiest
or
doing
one
cleverest
the
leaf
and
the
fruit
never
fitted
better
in
their
significance
than
to
sin
saxon
something
intenser
and
more
truly
living
was
taking
the
place
of
the
mere
flutter
and
flash
and
grace
of
effect
it
was
the
figure
in
which
the
dancers
form
in
facing
columns
two
and
two
the
girls
and
the
young
men
when
the
four
hands
round
keeps
them
moving
in
bright
circles
all
along
the
floor
and
under
arches
of
raised
and
joined
hands
the
girls
came
down
two
and
two
to
the
end
forming
their
long
line
face
to
face
against
the
opposing
line
of
their
partners
the
german
may
be
in
many
respects
an
undesirable
dance
it
may
be
as
i
have
sometimes
thought
at
least
a
selfish
dance
affording
pleasure
chiefly
to
the
initiated
few
and
excluding
gradually
almost
from
society
itself
those
who
do
not
participate
in
it
i
speak
of
it
here
neither
to
uphold
nor
to
condemn
simply
because
they
dance
it
at
outledge
as
they
do
everywhere
and
i
can
not
tell
my
story
without
it
but
i
think
at
this
moment
when
sin
saxon
led
the
figure
with
martha
josselyn
there
was
something
lovely
not
alone
in
its
graceful
grouping
but
in
the
very
spirit
and
possibility
of
the
thing
that
so
appeared
there
is
scope
and
chance
even
here
young
girls
for
the
beauty
of
kindness
and
generous
thought
even
here
one
may
give
a
joy
may
soothe
a
neglect
may
make
some
heart
conscious
for
a
moment
of
the
great
warmth
of
a
human
welcome
and
though
it
be
but
to
a
pastime
i
think
it
comes
into
the
benison
of
the
master
words
when
even
for
this
some
spirit
gets
a
feeling
like
them
i
was
a
stranger
and
ye
took
me
in
some
one
standing
behind
where
leslie
goldthwaite
came
to
her
place
at
the
end
of
the
line
by
the
had
followed
and
interpreted
the
whole
had
read
the
rare
shy
pleasure
in
martha
josselyn
face
and
movement
the
bright
expressive
warmth
in
sin
saxon
and
the
of
observation
upon
others
and
he
thought
as
i
do
of
the
mammon
of
unrighteousness
that
girl
has
even
sanctified
the
german
there
was
only
one
voice
like
that
only
one
person
who
would
so
speak
himself
out
leslie
goldthwaite
turned
quickly
and
found
herself
face
to
face
with
marmaduke
wharne
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
said
she
he
regarded
her
shrewdly
then
you
can
do
without
me
he
said
i
did
know
by
this
time
how
it
might
be
the
last
two
had
taken
their
places
below
leslie
while
these
words
were
exchanged
and
now
the
whole
line
moved
forward
to
meet
their
partners
and
the
waltz
began
frank
scherman
had
got
back
and
was
dancing
with
sin
saxon
leslie
and
dakie
thayne
were
together
as
they
had
been
that
first
evening
at
jefferson
and
as
they
often
were
the
four
stopped
after
their
merry
whirl
in
this
same
corner
by
the
door
where
wharne
was
standing
dakie
thayne
shook
hands
with
his
friend
in
his
glad
boy
way
across
their
greetings
came
sin
saxon
words
spoken
to
her
companion
you
to
take
her
frank
frank
scherman
was
an
old
childhood
friend
not
a
mere
mountain
acquaintance
i
bring
up
plenty
of
others
first
but
you
to
wait
and
take
and
wherever
she
got
her
training
you
find
she
the
among
us
it
was
among
the
children
training
them
that
she
had
caught
the
trick
of
it
but
sin
saxon
did
not
know
i
ready
to
agree
with
you
with
but
just
the
reservation
that
could
not
make
frank
scherman
answered
nonsense
said
sin
saxon
but
stop
here
something
better
and
quicker
they
getting
the
bouquets
give
her
yours
it
your
turn
go
sin
saxon
blue
eyes
sparkled
like
two
stars
the
golden
mist
of
her
hair
was
tossed
into
lighter
clouds
by
exercise
on
her
cheeks
a
bright
burned
and
the
lips
parted
with
their
sweetest
because
most
unconscious
curve
over
the
tiny
gleaming
teeth
her
word
and
her
glance
sent
frank
scherman
straight
to
do
her
bidding
and
a
bunch
of
wild
azaleas
and
scarlet
lilies
was
laid
in
martha
josselyn
hand
and
she
was
taken
out
again
into
the
dance
by
the
best
partner
there
we
may
trust
her
to
sin
saxon
and
frank
scherman
and
her
own
everything
will
not
go
by
her
any
more
and
she
but
twenty
marmaduke
wharne
watched
it
all
with
that
keen
glance
of
his
that
was
like
a
level
line
of
fire
from
under
the
rough
gray
brows
i
am
glad
you
saw
that
said
leslie
goldthwaite
watching
also
and
watching
him
by
the
light
of
your
own
little
text
and
bright
and
pleasant
you
think
it
will
do
me
good
i
think
it
good
and
i
am
glad
you
should
really
know
sin
saxon
at
the
first
and
at
the
best
marmaduke
wharne
quite
understood
her
she
gave
him
unconsciously
the
key
to
a
whole
character
it
might
as
easily
have
been
something
quite
different
that
he
should
have
first
seen
in
this
young
girl
next
morning
they
all
met
on
the
piazza
leslie
goldthwaite
presented
sin
saxon
to
wharne
so
my
dear
he
said
without
preface
you
are
the
belle
of
the
place
he
looked
to
see
how
she
would
take
it
there
was
not
the
first
twinkle
of
a
simper
about
eye
or
lip
surprised
but
quite
gravely
she
looked
up
and
met
his
odd
bluntness
with
as
quaint
an
honesty
of
her
own
i
was
pretty
sure
of
it
a
while
ago
she
said
and
perhaps
i
was
in
a
demoralized
sort
of
a
way
but
i
come
down
wharne
like
the
coon
i
tell
you
presently
she
went
on
and
she
spoke
now
with
warmth
who
is
the
real
belle
the
beautiful
one
of
this
place
there
she
comes
miss
craydocke
in
her
nice
plain
cambric
and
her
smooth
front
was
approaching
down
the
side
passage
across
the
wing
just
as
she
had
come
one
morning
weeks
ago
and
it
was
the
identical
fresh
petticoat
of
that
morning
she
wore
now
the
sudden
coincidence
and
recollection
struck
sin
saxon
as
she
spoke
to
her
surprise
miss
craydocke
and
marmaduke
wharne
moved
quickly
toward
each
other
and
grasped
hands
like
old
friends
then
you
know
all
about
it
sin
saxon
said
a
few
minutes
after
when
she
got
her
chance
but
you
know
sir
she
added
with
a
desperate
candor
the
way
i
took
to
find
it
out
i
been
tormenting
her
wharne
all
summer
and
i
heartily
ashamed
of
it
marmaduke
wharne
smiled
there
was
something
about
this
girl
that
suited
his
own
vein
i
doubt
she
tormented
he
said
quietly
at
that
sin
saxon
smiled
too
and
looked
up
out
of
her
hearty
shame
which
she
had
truly
felt
upon
her
at
her
own
reminder
no
wharne
she
never
was
but
that
was
my
fault
after
all
perhaps
is
that
what
the
optimists
think
it
was
best
so
i
should
never
have
found
her
thoroughly
out
in
any
other
way
it
like
and
there
she
stopped
short
of
her
comparison
like
what
asked
wharne
waiting
i
ca
tell
you
now
sir
she
answered
with
a
gleam
of
her
old
fearless
brightness
it
one
end
of
a
grand
idea
i
believe
that
i
just
touched
on
i
must
think
it
out
if
i
can
and
see
if
it
all
holds
together
and
then
i
to
have
it
it
will
take
a
monstrous
deal
of
thinking
mr
wharne
chapter
xv
quicksilver
and
gold
if
i
could
only
remember
the
chemicals
said
sin
saxon
she
was
down
among
the
outcrops
and
fragments
at
the
foot
of
minster
rock
close
in
around
the
stones
grew
the
short
mossy
sward
in
a
safe
hollow
between
two
of
them
against
a
back
formed
by
another
that
rose
higher
with
a
smooth
perpendicular
she
had
chosen
her
fireplace
and
there
she
had
been
making
the
coffee
quite
intent
upon
the
comfort
of
her
friends
she
was
something
really
to
do
she
had
in
better
business
as
leslie
goldthwaite
phrased
it
to
herself
once
she
found
herself
than
only
to
make
herself
brilliant
and
enchanting
after
the
manner
of
the
day
at
and
let
me
assure
you
if
you
have
not
tried
it
that
to
make
the
coffee
and
arrange
the
feast
at
a
picnic
like
this
is
something
quite
different
from
being
merely
an
ornamental
there
is
the
fire
to
coax
with
chips
and
twigs
and
a
good
deal
of
smoke
to
swallow
and
one
dress
to
disregard
and
all
the
rest
are
off
in
scattered
groups
not
caring
in
the
least
to
watch
the
pot
boil
but
supposing
none
the
less
that
it
will
to
be
sure
frank
scherman
and
dakie
thayne
brought
her
firewood
and
the
water
from
the
spring
and
waited
loyally
while
she
seemed
to
need
them
indeed
frank
scherman
much
as
he
unquestionably
was
charmed
with
her
gay
moods
stayed
longest
by
her
in
her
quiet
ones
but
she
herself
sent
them
off
at
last
to
climb
with
leslie
and
the
josselyns
again
into
the
minster
and
see
thence
the
wonderful
picture
that
the
late
sloping
light
made
on
the
far
hills
and
fields
that
showed
to
their
sight
between
framing
and
tall
as
they
looked
from
out
the
dimness
of
the
rock
she
sat
there
alone
working
out
a
thought
and
at
last
she
spoke
as
i
have
said
if
i
could
only
remember
the
chemicals
my
dear
what
do
you
mean
the
chemicals
for
the
coffee
it
was
miss
craydocke
who
questioned
coming
up
with
wharne
not
the
coffee
no
said
sin
saxon
laughing
rather
absently
as
too
intent
to
be
purely
amused
but
the
assaying
there
i
remembered
word
at
least
miss
craydocke
was
more
than
ever
bewildered
what
is
it
my
dear
an
experiment
no
an
analogy
something
that
been
in
my
head
these
three
days
i
ca
make
everything
quite
clear
wharne
but
i
know
it
there
i
went
i
must
tell
you
a
little
while
ago
to
see
some
colorado
specimens
ores
and
things
that
some
friends
of
ours
had
who
are
interested
in
the
mines
and
they
talked
about
the
processes
and
somebody
explained
there
were
gold
and
silver
and
iron
and
copper
and
lead
and
sulphur
that
had
all
been
boiled
up
together
some
time
and
cooled
into
rock
and
the
thing
was
to
sort
them
out
first
they
crushed
the
whole
mass
into
powder
and
then
did
something
to
it
applied
heat
i
believe
to
drive
away
the
sulphur
that
fumed
off
and
left
the
rest
as
promiscuous
as
before
then
they
oxidized
the
lead
however
they
managed
it
and
got
that
out
you
see
i
not
quite
sure
of
the
order
of
things
or
of
the
chemical
part
but
they
got
it
out
and
something
took
it
then
they
put
in
quicksilver
and
that
took
hold
of
the
gold
then
there
were
silver
and
copper
and
iron
so
they
had
to
put
back
the
lead
again
and
that
grappled
the
silver
and
what
they
did
with
the
copper
and
iron
is
just
what
i
ca
possibly
recollect
but
they
divided
them
somehow
and
there
was
the
great
rock
riddle
all
read
out
now
have
we
been
just
like
that
this
summer
and
i
wonder
if
the
world
is
like
it
somehow
and
ourselves
too
all
muddled
up
and
not
knowing
what
we
made
of
till
the
right
chemicals
touch
us
there
so
much
in
it
wharne
i
ca
put
it
in
clear
order
but
it
there
is
it
yes
it
is
there
answered
wharne
with
the
briefest
gravity
for
miss
craydocke
there
were
little
shining
drops
standing
in
her
eyes
and
she
tried
not
to
wink
lest
they
should
fall
out
pretending
they
had
been
really
tears
and
what
was
there
to
cry
about
you
know
here
we
have
been
sin
saxon
resumed
all
crushed
up
together
and
the
characters
coming
out
little
by
little
with
different
things
sulphur
always
the
first
heats
up
and
flies
off
it
do
take
long
to
find
that
and
common
oxygen
gets
at
common
lead
and
so
on
but
dear
miss
craydocke
do
you
know
what
comforts
me
that
you
have
the
quicksilver
to
discover
the
gold
miss
craydocke
winked
she
had
to
do
it
then
and
the
two
little
round
drops
fell
they
went
down
unseen
into
the
short
and
i
wonder
what
little
grew
of
their
watering
some
day
afterward
it
was
getting
a
little
too
quiet
between
them
now
for
people
on
a
picnic
perhaps
and
so
in
a
minute
sin
saxon
said
again
it
good
to
know
there
is
a
way
to
sort
everything
out
perhaps
the
tares
and
wheat
mean
the
same
thing
wharne
why
is
it
that
things
seem
more
sure
and
true
as
soon
as
we
find
out
we
can
make
an
allegory
to
them
because
we
do
make
the
allegory
it
is
there
as
you
have
said
will
open
my
mouth
in
parables
i
will
utter
things
which
have
been
kept
secret
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
these
things
are
that
speech
of
god
that
was
in
the
beginning
the
word
made
flesh
it
is
he
that
interpreteth
that
was
too
great
to
give
small
answer
to
nobody
spoke
again
till
sin
saxon
had
to
jump
up
to
attend
to
her
coffee
that
was
boiling
over
and
then
they
took
up
their
little
cares
of
the
feast
and
their
chat
over
it
cakes
and
coffee
fruits
and
cream
i
do
not
care
to
linger
over
these
i
would
rather
take
you
to
the
cool
shadowy
solemn
minster
cavern
the
deep
wondrous
recess
in
the
face
of
solid
rock
whose
foundation
and
whose
roof
are
a
mountain
or
above
upon
the
beetling
crag
that
makes
but
its
and
looks
forth
itself
across
great
toward
its
kindred
cliffs
lesser
and
more
mighty
all
around
making
one
listen
in
one
heart
for
the
awful
voices
wherewith
they
call
to
each
other
forevermore
the
party
had
scattered
again
after
the
repast
and
leslie
and
the
josselyns
had
gone
back
into
the
minster
entrance
where
they
never
tired
of
standing
and
out
of
whose
gloom
they
looked
now
upon
all
the
flood
of
splendor
rosy
purple
and
gold
which
the
royal
sun
flung
back
his
last
and
richest
largess
upon
the
heights
that
looked
longest
after
him
wharne
and
miss
craydocke
climbed
the
cliff
sin
saxon
on
her
way
up
stopped
short
among
the
broken
crags
below
there
was
something
very
earnest
in
her
gaze
as
she
lifted
her
eyes
wide
and
beautiful
with
the
wonder
in
them
to
the
face
of
granite
upreared
before
her
and
then
turned
slowly
to
look
across
and
up
the
valley
where
other
and
yet
grander
mountain
ramparts
thrust
their
great
forbiddance
on
the
reaching
vision
she
sat
down
where
she
was
upon
a
rock
you
are
very
tired
frank
scherman
said
inquiringly
see
how
they
measure
themselves
against
each
other
sin
saxon
said
for
answer
look
at
them
leslie
and
the
rest
inside
the
minster
that
arches
up
so
many
times
their
height
above
their
heads
yet
what
a
little
bit
a
mere
mousehole
it
is
out
of
the
cliff
itself
and
then
look
at
the
whole
cliff
against
the
ledges
that
seen
from
anywhere
else
seem
to
run
so
low
along
the
river
and
compare
the
ledges
with
and
with
giant
cairn
and
giant
cairn
with
washington
thirty
miles
away
it
is
grand
surveying
said
frank
scherman
i
think
we
see
things
from
the
little
best
rejoined
sin
saxon
washington
is
the
big
end
of
the
telescope
now
you
have
made
me
look
at
it
said
frank
scherman
i
do
think
i
have
been
in
any
other
spot
that
has
given
me
such
a
real
idea
of
the
mountains
as
this
one
must
have
steps
to
climb
by
even
in
imagination
how
impertinent
we
are
rushing
at
the
tremendousness
of
washington
in
the
way
we
do
scaling
it
in
little
and
never
taking
in
the
thought
of
it
at
all
something
suddenly
brought
a
flush
to
sin
saxon
face
and
almost
a
quiver
to
her
lips
she
was
sitting
with
her
hands
clasped
across
her
knees
and
her
head
a
little
bent
with
a
downward
look
after
that
long
wondering
mountain
gaze
that
had
filled
itself
and
then
withdrawn
for
thought
she
lifted
her
face
suddenly
to
her
companion
the
impetuous
look
was
in
her
eyes
there
other
measuring
too
frank
what
a
fool
i
been
frank
scherman
was
silent
it
was
a
little
awkward
for
him
scarcely
comprehending
what
she
meant
he
could
by
no
means
agree
with
sin
saxon
when
she
called
herself
a
fool
yet
he
hardly
knew
what
he
was
to
contradict
we
well
placed
at
this
minute
leslie
goldthwaite
and
dakie
thayne
and
the
josselyns
half
way
up
above
there
in
the
minster
wharne
and
miss
craydocke
at
the
top
and
i
down
here
where
i
belong
impertinence
to
think
of
the
things
i
said
in
my
silliness
to
that
woman
whose
greatness
i
can
no
more
measure
why
did
somebody
stop
me
i
do
answer
for
you
frank
and
i
wo
keep
you
but
i
think
i
just
stay
where
i
am
and
not
spoil
the
significance
i
content
to
rank
beside
you
we
can
climb
together
said
frank
scherman
even
miss
craydocke
has
not
got
to
the
highest
you
see
he
went
on
a
little
hurriedly
sin
saxon
broke
in
as
hurriedly
as
he
with
a
deeper
flush
still
upon
her
face
there
everything
beyond
that
part
of
it
but
she
helps
one
to
feel
what
the
higher
the
highest
must
be
she
like
the
rock
she
stands
on
she
one
of
the
steps
come
asenath
let
go
up
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
her
till
she
took
it
and
rose
they
had
known
each
other
from
childhood
as
i
said
but
frank
scherman
hardly
ever
called
her
by
her
name
miss
saxon
was
formal
and
her
school
sobriquet
he
could
not
use
it
seemed
to
mean
a
great
deal
when
he
did
say
asenath
and
sin
saxon
took
his
hand
and
let
him
lead
her
up
notwithstanding
the
significance
they
are
young
and
i
am
not
writing
a
but
i
think
they
will
climb
together
and
that
the
words
that
wait
to
be
said
are
mere
words
they
have
known
and
understood
each
other
so
long
i
feel
like
a
camel
at
a
fountain
drinking
in
what
is
to
last
through
the
dry
places
said
martha
josselyn
as
they
came
up
miss
saxon
you
do
know
what
you
have
given
us
i
shall
take
home
the
hills
in
my
heart
we
might
have
gone
without
seeing
this
said
susan
no
you
might
said
sin
saxon
it
my
good
luck
to
see
you
see
it
that
all
it
could
be
in
the
order
of
things
you
know
that
you
should
be
so
near
it
and
want
it
and
not
have
it
somehow
so
much
in
the
order
of
things
though
said
martha
and
there
are
so
many
things
we
want
without
knowing
them
even
to
that
the
beauty
of
it
i
think
said
leslie
goldthwaite
turning
back
from
where
she
stood
bright
in
the
sunset
glory
on
the
open
rock
her
voice
was
like
that
of
some
young
prophet
of
joy
she
was
so
full
of
the
gladness
and
loveliness
of
the
time
that
the
beauty
of
it
i
think
there
is
such
a
worldful
and
you
never
know
what
you
may
be
coming
to
next
well
this
is
our
last
of
the
mountains
we
go
on
tuesday
it
is
your
last
of
us
though
or
of
what
we
want
of
you
rejoined
sin
saxon
we
must
have
the
tableaux
for
monday
we
ca
do
without
you
in
robin
gray
or
consolation
and
about
tuesday
it
only
your
own
making
up
of
minds
you
have
written
have
you
they
do
expect
you
when
a
week
broken
in
upon
like
a
dollar
the
rest
is
of
no
account
and
there
be
sure
to
be
something
doing
so
many
are
going
the
week
after
we
shall
have
letters
said
susan
but
i
think
we
must
go
on
tuesday
everybody
had
letters
that
night
the
mail
was
in
early
and
captain
green
came
up
from
the
as
the
minster
party
was
alighting
from
the
wagons
he
gave
dakie
thayne
the
bag
it
was
dakie
delight
to
distribute
calling
out
the
fortunate
names
as
the
expectant
group
pressed
around
him
like
people
waiting
the
issue
of
a
lottery
venture
linceford
miss
goldthwaite
linceford
master
hm
thayne
and
he
pocketed
a
big
one
like
a
dispatch
captain
jotham
green
where
is
he
here
captain
green
you
and
i
have
got
the
biggest
if
linceford
does
get
the
most
i
believe
she
tells
her
friends
to
write
in
hits
and
put
one
letter
into
three
or
four
envelopes
when
i
was
a
little
boy
i
used
to
get
a
dollar
changed
into
a
hundred
coppers
and
feel
ever
so
much
richer
that
boy
forwardness
is
getting
insufferable
exclaimed
thoresby
sitting
apart
with
two
or
three
others
who
had
not
joined
the
group
about
dakie
thayne
and
why
captain
green
should
give
the
bag
always
i
ca
understand
it
is
growing
to
be
a
positive
nuisance
nobody
out
of
the
thoresby
clique
thought
it
so
they
had
a
merry
time
together
you
and
i
and
the
post
as
dakie
said
but
then
between
you
and
me
and
that
confidential
personage
thoresby
and
her
daughters
had
very
many
letters
that
is
all
said
dakie
shaking
the
bag
they
only
for
the
very
good
he
was
not
saucy
he
was
only
glad
he
knew
noll
square
handwriting
and
his
big
envelopes
there
was
great
news
at
the
cottage
they
were
to
have
a
hero
perhaps
two
or
three
among
them
general
ingleside
and
friends
were
coming
early
in
the
week
the
captain
told
them
with
expansive
face
there
are
a
great
many
generals
and
a
great
many
heroes
now
this
man
had
been
a
hero
beside
sheridan
and
under
sherman
colonel
ingleside
he
was
at
stone
river
and
chattanooga
leading
a
brave
western
regiment
in
desperate
magnificent
charges
whose
daring
helped
to
turn
that
terrible
point
of
the
war
and
made
his
fame
but
leslie
though
her
heart
stirred
at
the
thought
of
a
real
great
commander
fresh
from
the
field
had
her
own
news
that
half
neutralized
the
excitement
of
the
other
cousin
delight
was
coming
to
share
her
room
with
her
for
the
last
fortnight
the
josselyns
got
their
letters
aunt
lucy
was
staying
on
aunt
husband
had
gone
away
to
preach
for
three
sundays
for
a
parish
where
he
had
a
prospect
of
a
call
josselyn
could
not
leave
home
immediately
therefore
although
the
girls
should
return
and
their
room
was
the
airiest
for
aunt
lucy
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
not
prolong
their
holiday
if
they
chose
and
they
might
hardly
ever
get
away
to
the
mountains
again
more
than
all
uncle
david
was
off
once
more
for
china
and
japan
and
had
given
his
sister
two
more
fifties
for
what
did
a
sailor
want
of
greenbacks
after
he
got
afloat
it
was
a
clover
summer
for
the
josselyns
uncle
david
and
his
fifties
would
be
back
among
them
for
two
years
or
more
they
must
make
the
most
of
it
sin
saxon
sat
up
late
writing
this
letter
to
her
mother
darling
mamma
i
just
begun
to
find
out
really
what
to
do
here
cream
does
always
rise
to
the
top
you
remember
the
josselyns
our
quiet
neighbors
in
town
that
lived
in
the
little
house
in
the
block
opposite
sue
josselyn
effie
schoolmate
and
how
they
used
to
tell
me
stories
and
keep
me
to
well
the
cream
they
and
miss
craydocke
sue
has
been
in
the
hospitals
two
years
mamma
while
i
been
learning
nocturnes
and
going
to
germans
and
martha
has
been
at
home
sewing
her
face
sharp
and
they
here
now
to
get
rounded
out
well
now
mamma
i
want
so
a
real
dish
of
mountains
and
cream
if
you
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
i
want
to
take
a
wagon
and
invite
a
party
as
i
did
my
little
one
to
minster
rock
and
go
through
the
hills
be
gone
as
many
days
as
you
will
send
me
money
for
and
i
want
you
to
take
the
money
from
that
particular
little
corner
of
your
purse
where
my
carpet
and
and
curtains
that
were
to
my
room
on
my
leaving
school
are
metaphorically
rolled
up
there
plenty
there
you
know
for
you
promised
me
my
choice
of
everything
and
i
had
fixed
on
that
lovely
paper
at
with
the
ivy
and
holly
pattern
and
the
ivy
and
carpet
that
was
such
a
match
i
have
something
cheaper
or
nothing
at
all
and
thank
you
unutterably
if
you
only
let
me
have
my
way
in
this
it
will
do
me
so
much
good
mamma
more
than
you
the
least
idea
of
people
can
do
without
french
paper
and
brussels
carpets
but
everybody
has
a
right
to
mountain
and
sea
and
cloud
glory
only
they
do
half
of
them
get
it
and
perhaps
that
the
other
half
lookout
i
know
you
understand
me
mamma
particularly
when
i
talk
sense
for
you
always
understood
my
nonsense
when
nobody
else
did
and
i
going
to
do
your
faith
and
discrimination
credit
yet
your
bad
child
with
just
a
small
hidden
savor
of
grace
in
her
your
child

why
did
you
tell
us
saturday
was
a
day
of
hammering
basting
draping
dressing
rehearsing
running
from
room
to
room
upstairs
in
green
garret
leslie
goldthwaite
and
dakie
thayne
with
a
third
party
never
before
introduced
upon
the
stage
had
a
private
practicing
and
at
when
the
great
hall
was
cleared
they
got
up
there
with
sin
saxon
and
frank
scherman
locked
the
doors
and
in
costume
with
regular
accompaniment
of
bell
and
curtain
the
performance
was
repeated
dakie
thayne
was
and
sin
saxon
and
frank
scherman
represented
the
audience
with
clapping
and
stamping
and
laughter
that
suspended
both
making
as
nearly
the
noise
of
two
hundred
as
two
could
this
being
an
essential
part
of
the
rehearsal
in
respect
to
the
untried
nerves
of
the
which
might
easily
be
a
little
uncertain
he
stands
fire
like
a
yankee
veteran
it
inimitable
said
sin
saxon
wiping
the
moist
merriment
from
her
eyes
and
your
cap
leslie
and
that
bonnet
and
this
unutterable
old
oddity
of
a
gown
who
did
contrive
it
all
and
where
did
they
come
from
you
carry
off
the
glory
of
the
evening
it
ought
to
be
the
last
no
indeed
said
leslie
barbara
frietchie
must
be
last
of
course
but
i
so
glad
you
think
it
will
do
i
hope
they
be
amused
amused
if
you
could
only
see
your
own
face
i
see
sir
charles
and
that
makes
mine
the
new
performer
you
perceive
was
an
actor
with
a
title
that
night
coach
driving
up
while
the
of
the
other
tableaux
was
going
on
at
the
hall
brought
cousin
delight
to
the
green
cottage
and
leslie
met
her
at
the
door
sunday
morning
was
a
pause
and
rest
and
hush
of
beauty
and
joy
they
sat
delight
and
leslie
by
their
open
window
where
the
smell
of
the
lately
harvested
hay
came
over
from
the
wide
sunshiny
entrance
of
the
great
barn
and
away
beyond
stretched
the
pine
woods
and
the
hills
swelled
near
in
dusky
evergreen
and
indigo
shadows
and
lessened
far
down
toward
winnipiseogee
to
where
faint
and
tender
and
blue
the
outline
of
little
ossipee
peeped
in
between
great
shoulders
so
modestly
seen
only
through
the
clearest
air
on
days
like
this
leslie
little
table
with
fresh
white
cover
held
a
vase
of
ferns
and
white
convolvulus
and
beside
this
cousin
delight
two
books
that
came
out
always
from
the
top
of
her
trunk
her
bible
and
her
little
daily
food
the
verses
from
old
and
new
testaments
were
these
the
steps
of
a
good
man
are
ordered
by
the
lord
and
he
delighteth
in
his
way
walk
circumspectly
not
as
fools
but
as
wise
redeeming
the
time
they
had
a
talk
about
the
first
the
steps
the
little
details
not
merely
the
general
trend
and
final
issue
if
indeed
these
could
be
directed
without
the
other
you
always
make
me
see
things
cousin
delight
leslie
said
it
is
very
plain
delight
answered
if
people
only
would
read
the
bible
as
they
read
even
a
careless
letter
from
a
friend
counting
each
word
of
value
and
searching
for
more
meaning
and
fresh
inference
to
draw
out
the
most
one
word
often
answers
great
doubts
and
askings
that
have
troubled
the
world
afterward
they
walked
round
by
a
still
under
the
ledge
to
the
north
village
where
there
was
a
service
it
was
a
plain
little
church
with
unpainted
pews
but
the
windows
looked
forth
upon
a
green
mountain
side
and
whispers
of
oaks
and
pines
and
crept
in
and
the
breath
of
sweet
heaped
in
a
great
bowl
upon
the
communion
table
of
common
stained
cherrywood
floated
up
and
filled
the
place
the
minister
a
quiet
man
stayed
his
foot
an
instant
at
that
simple
altar
before
he
went
up
the
few
steps
to
the
desk
he
had
a
sermon
in
his
pocket
from
the
text
the
hairs
of
your
heads
are
all
numbered
he
changed
it
at
the
moment
in
his
mind
and
when
presently
he
rose
to
preach
gave
forth
in
a
tone
touched
through
the
very
presence
of
that
reminding
beauty
with
the
very
spontaneousness
of
the
master
own
saying
consider
the
lilies
and
then
he
told
them
of
god
momently
thought
and
care
there
were
scattered
strangers
from
various
houses
among
the
simple
rural
congregation
walking
home
through
the
pines
again
delight
and
leslie
and
dakie
thayne
found
themselves
preceded
and
followed
along
the
narrow
way
sin
saxon
and
frank
scherman
came
up
and
joined
them
when
the
wider
openings
permitted
two
persons
just
in
front
were
commenting
upon
the
sermon
very
fair
for
a
country
parson
said
a
tall
man
whose
broad
intellectual
brow
was
touched
by
dark
hair
slightly
frosted
and
whose
lip
had
the
curve
that
betokens
and
strong
decision
very
fair
all
the
better
for
not
flying
too
high
narrow
of
course
he
seems
to
think
the
almighty
has
nothing
grander
to
do
than
to
finger
every
little
cog
of
the
tremendous
machinery
of
the
universe
that
he
measures
out
the
ocean
of
his
purposes
as
we
drop
a
liquid
from
a
phial
to
me
it
seems
belittling
the
infinite
i
do
know
whether
it
is
littleness
or
greatness
robert
that
must
escape
minutiae
said
his
companion
apparently
his
wife
if
we
could
reach
to
the
particles
perhaps
we
might
move
the
mountains
we
never
agree
upon
this
margie
we
wo
begin
again
to
my
mind
the
grand
plan
of
things
was
settled
ages
ago
the
impulses
generated
that
must
needs
work
on
foreknowledge
and
intention
doubtless
in
that
sense
the
hairs
numbered
but
that
there
is
a
special
direction
and
interference
for
you
and
me
well
we
wo
argue
as
i
said
but
i
never
can
conceive
it
so
and
i
think
a
wider
look
at
the
world
brings
a
question
to
all
such
primitive
faith
the
speakers
turned
down
a
side
way
with
this
leaving
the
ledge
path
and
their
subject
to
our
friends
only
to
their
thoughts
at
first
but
presently
cousin
delight
said
in
a
quiet
tone
to
leslie
that
account
for
the
steps
does
it
i
am
glad
it
said
leslie
dakie
thayne
turned
a
look
toward
leslie
as
if
he
would
gladly
know
of
what
she
spoke
a
look
in
which
a
kind
of
gentle
reverence
was
strangely
mingled
with
the
open
friendliness
i
can
not
easily
indicate
to
you
the
sort
of
feeling
with
which
the
boy
had
come
to
regard
this
young
girl
just
above
him
in
years
and
thought
and
in
the
attitude
which
true
womanhood
young
or
old
takes
toward
man
he
had
no
sisters
he
had
been
intimately
associated
with
no
he
had
lived
with
his
brother
and
an
uncle
and
a
young
aunt
rose
leslie
goldthwaite
kindness
had
drawn
him
into
the
sphere
of
a
new
and
powerful
influence
something
different
in
thought
and
purpose
from
the
apparent
unthought
of
the
present
little
world
about
her
and
this
lifted
her
up
in
his
regard
and
enshrined
her
with
a
sort
of
pure
sanctity
he
was
sometimes
really
timid
before
her
in
the
midst
of
his
frank
chivalry
i
wish
you
tell
me
he
said
suddenly
falling
back
with
her
as
the
path
narrowed
again
what
are
the
it
was
a
verse
we
found
this
morning
cousin
delight
and
i
leslie
answered
and
as
she
spoke
the
color
came
up
full
in
her
cheeks
and
her
voice
was
a
little
shy
and
tremulous
steps
of
a
good
man
are
ordered
by
the
lord
that
one
word
seemed
to
make
one
certain
not
path
nor
the
end
of
it
but
all
the
way
somehow
she
was
quite
out
of
breath
as
she
finished
meantime
sin
saxon
and
frank
had
got
with
miss
goldthwaite
and
were
talking
too
set
spinning
they
heard
sin
saxon
say
and
then
let
go
that
was
his
idea
well
only
it
seems
to
me
there
been
especial
pains
taken
to
show
us
it
ca
be
done
or
else
why
do
they
find
out
perpetual
motion
everything
stops
after
a
while
unless
i
ca
talk
theologically
but
i
mean
all
right
you
hit
it
again
you
a
way
of
your
own
of
putting
things
asenath
said
frank
scherman
with
a
glance
that
beamed
kindly
and
admiringly
upon
her
and
her
way
but
you
put
that
clear
to
me
as
nobody
else
ever
did
a
proof
set
in
the
very
laws
themselves
momentum
that
must
lessen
and
lose
itself
with
the
square
of
the
distance
the
machinery
cavil
do
wheels
but
a
living
spirit
within
the
wheels
said
cousin
delight
every
instant
a
fresh
impulse
to
think
of
it
so
makes
it
real
miss
goldthwaite
and
grand
and
awful
the
young
man
spoke
with
a
strength
in
the
clear
voice
that
could
be
so
light
and
gay
and
tender
too
layest
thine
hand
upon
me
said
delight
goldthwaite
sin
saxon
was
quiet
her
own
thought
coming
back
upon
her
with
a
reflective
force
and
a
thrill
at
her
heart
at
frank
scherman
words
had
these
two
only
planned
tableaux
and
danced
germans
together
before
dakie
thayne
walked
on
by
leslie
goldthwaite
side
in
his
happy
content
touched
with
something
higher
and
brighter
through
that
instant
approach
and
confidence
if
i
were
to
write
down
his
thought
as
he
walked
it
would
be
with
phrase
and
distinction
peculiar
to
himself
and
to
the
it
the
real
thing
with
her
it
make
a
fellow
squirm
like
a
pin
put
out
at
a
caterpillar
she
but
she
is
this
was
the
sunday
that
lay
between
the
busy
saturday
and
monday
it
is
always
so
wherever
cousin
delight
is
leslie
goldthwaite
said
to
herself
comparing
it
with
other
sundays
that
had
gone
yet
she
too
for
weeks
before
by
the
truth
that
had
come
into
her
own
life
and
gone
out
from
it
had
been
helping
to
make
these
moments
possible
she
had
been
shone
upon
and
had
put
forth
henceforth
she
should
scarcely
know
when
the
fruit
was
ripening
or
sowing
itself
anew
or
the
good
and
gladness
of
it
were
at
human
lips
she
was
in
linceford
room
on
monday
morning
putting
high
corks
to
the
heels
of
her
slippers
when
sin
saxon
came
over
hurriedly
and
tapped
at
the
door
you
be
old
women
she
asked
the
instant
leslie
opened
ginevra
thoresby
has
given
out
she
says
it
her
cold
that
she
does
feel
equal
to
it
but
the
amount
of
it
is
she
got
her
chill
with
the
shannons
going
away
so
suddenly
and
the
amy
robsart
and
queen
elizabeth
picture
being
dropped
there
was
nothing
else
to
put
her
in
and
so
she
wo
be
barbara
wo
be
barbara
frietchie
cried
leslie
with
an
astonishment
as
if
it
had
been
angelhood
refused
no
barbara
frietchie
is
only
an
old
woman
in
a
cap
and
kerchief
and
she
just
puts
her
head
out
of
a
window
the
is
the
whole
of
it
ginevra
thoresby
says
i
do
it
do
you
think
i
can
be
different
enough
in
the
two
will
there
be
time
leslie
questioned
eagerly
we
change
the
programme
and
put
the
oath
between
the
caps
can
be
different
and
you
can
powder
your
hair
for
one
and
it
do
to
ask
miss
craydocke
for
a
front
for
the
other
sin
saxon
had
grown
delicate
in
her
feeling
for
the
dear
old
friend
whose
hair
had
once
been
golden
i
tell
her
about
it
and
ask
her
to
help
me
contrive
she
be
sure
to
think
of
anything
that
can
be
thought
of
only
there
the
dance
afterward
and
you
had
so
much
more
costume
for
the
other
sin
saxon
said
demurringly
never
mind
i
shall
barbara
and
barbara
would
dance
i
suppose
mother
hubbard
would
marvelously
never
mind
leslie
answered
again
laying
down
the
little
slipper
finished
she
do
care
she
is
so
that
she
helps
along
sin
saxon
said
of
her
rejoining
the
others
in
the
hall
i
ashamed
of
myself
and
all
the
rest
of
you
beside
her
now
make
yourselves
as
fine
as
you
please
we
must
pass
over
the
hours
as
only
stories
and
dreams
do
and
put
ourselves
at
ten
of
the
clock
that
night
behind
the
green
curtain
and
the
footlights
in
the
blaze
of
the
three
rows
of
bright
lamps
that
one
above
another
poured
their
illumination
from
the
left
upon
the
stage
behind
the
wide
susan
josselyn
and
frank
scherman
were
just
posed
for
consolation
they
had
given
susan
this
part
after
all
because
they
wanted
martha
for
taking
the
oath
afterward
leslie
goldthwaite
was
giving
a
hasty
touch
to
the
tent
drapery
and
the
gray
blanket
leonard
brookhouse
and
dakie
thayne
manned
the
halyards
for
raising
the
curtain
there
was
the
usual
scuttling
about
the
stage
for
hasty
clearance
and
sin
hand
was
on
the
bell
when
grahame
lowe
sprang
hastily
in
through
the
upon
the
scene
hold
on
a
minute
he
said
to
brookhouse
miss
saxon
general
ingleside
and
party
are
over
at
green
been
there
since
nine
ought
we
to
send
compliments
or
something
before
we
finish
up
then
there
was
a
pressing
forward
and
an
excitement
the
wounded
soldier
sprang
from
his
couch
the
nun
came
nearer
with
a
quick
light
in
her
eye
leslie
goldthwaite
in
her
mob
cap
quilted
petticoat
calico
train
and
shoes
two
or
three
supernumeraries
in
rebel
gray
with
bayonets
coming
on
in
barbara
frietchie
and
sir
charles
bouncing
out
from
somewhere
behind
to
the
great
hazard
of
the
frame
of
lights
huddled
together
upon
the
stage
and
consulted
dakie
thayne
had
dropped
his
cord
and
almost
made
a
rush
off
at
the
first
announcement
but
he
stood
now
with
a
repressed
eagerness
that
trembled
through
every
fibre
and
waited
would
he
come
is
it
too
late
would
it
be
any
compliment
wo
it
be
rude
not
to
all
the
patriotic
pieces
are
just
coming
will
the
audience
like
to
wait
make
a
speech
and
tell
you
brookhouse
oh
he
come
barbara
frietchie
and
the
flag
just
think
is
it
grand
oh
i
so
frightened
these
were
the
hurried
sentences
that
made
the
buzz
behind
the
scenes
while
in
front
all
the
world
wondered
meanwhile
lamps
trembled
the
curtain
vibrated
the
very
framework
swayed
what
is
it
fire
queried
a
nervous
voice
from
near
the
footlights
this
wo
do
said
frank
scherman
speak
to
them
brookhouse
dakie
thayne
run
over
to
green
and
say
the
ladies
compliments
to
general
ingleside
and
friends
and
beg
the
honor
of
their
presence
at
the
concluding
tableaux
dakie
was
off
with
a
glowing
face
something
like
an
odd
knowing
smile
twinkling
out
from
the
glow
also
as
he
looked
up
at
scherman
and
took
his
orders
all
this
while
he
had
said
nothing
leonard
brookhouse
made
his
little
speech
received
with
applause
and
a
cheer
then
they
quieted
down
behind
the
scenes
and
a
rustle
and
buzz
began
in
front
kept
up
for
five
minutes
or
so
in
gentle
fashion
till
two
gentlemen
in
plain
clothes
walked
quietly
in
at
the
open
door
at
sight
of
whom
with
instinctive
certainty
the
whole
assembly
rose
leslie
goldthwaite
peeping
through
the
folds
of
the
curtain
saw
a
tall
man
in
what
may
be
called
the
youth
of
middle
age
every
inch
a
soldier
bowing
as
he
was
ushered
forward
to
a
seat
vacated
for
him
and
followed
by
one
younger
who
modestly
ignored
the
notice
intended
for
his
chief
dakie
thayne
was
making
his
way
with
eyes
alight
and
excited
down
a
side
passage
to
his
post
then
the
two
actors
hurried
once
more
into
position
the
stage
was
cleared
by
a
whispered
peremptory
order
the
bell
rung
once
the
tent
trembling
with
some
one
whisking
further
out
of
sight
behind
it
twice
and
the
curtain
rose
upon
consolation
lovely
as
the
picture
is
it
was
lovelier
in
the
living
tableau
there
was
something
deep
and
intense
in
the
pale
calm
of
susan
face
which
they
had
not
counted
on
even
when
they
discovered
that
hers
was
the
very
face
for
the
sister
something
made
you
thrill
at
the
thought
of
what
those
eyes
would
show
if
the
downcast
quiet
lids
were
raised
the
earnest
gaze
of
the
dying
soldier
met
more
perhaps
in
its
uplifting
for
frank
scherman
had
a
look
in
this
instant
of
enacting
that
he
had
never
got
before
in
all
his
practicings
the
picture
was
too
real
for
applause
almost
it
suddenly
seemed
for
representation
do
i
know
that
face
noll
general
ingleside
asked
in
a
low
tone
of
his
companion
instead
of
answering
at
once
the
younger
man
bent
further
forward
toward
the
stage
and
his
own
very
plain
broad
honest
face
full
over
against
the
downcast
one
of
the
sister
of
mercy
took
upon
itself
that
force
of
magnetic
expression
which
makes
a
look
felt
even
across
a
crowd
of
other
glances
as
if
there
were
but
one
straight
line
of
vision
and
that
between
such
two
the
curtain
was
going
slowly
down
the
veiling
lids
trembled
and
the
paleness
replaced
itself
with
a
flush
of
color
over
the
features
still
held
motionless
they
let
the
cords
run
more
quickly
then
she
was
getting
tired
they
said
the
curtain
had
been
up
too
long
be
that
as
it
might
nothing
could
persuade
susan
josselyn
to
sit
again
and
consolation
could
not
be
repeated
so
then
came
mother
hubbard
and
her
dog
the
slow
old
lady
and
the
knowing
beast
that
was
always
getting
one
step
ahead
of
her
the
possibility
had
occurred
to
leslie
goldthwaite
as
she
and
dakie
thayne
amused
themselves
one
day
with
captain
green
sagacious
sir
charles
grandison
a
handsome
black
spaniel
whose
trained
accomplishment
was
to
hold
himself
patiently
in
any
posture
in
which
he
might
be
placed
until
the
word
of
release
was
given
you
might
stand
him
on
his
hind
legs
with
paws
folded
on
his
breast
you
might
extend
him
on
his
back
with
helpless
legs
in
air
you
might
put
him
in
any
attitude
possible
to
be
maintained
and
maintain
it
he
would
faithfully
until
the
signal
was
made
from
this
prompting
came
the
illustration
of
mother
hubbard
also
leslie
goldthwaite
had
seized
the
hidden
suggestion
of
application
and
hinted
it
in
certain
touches
of
costume
and
order
of
performance
nobody
would
think
perhaps
at
first
that
the
striped
scarlet
and
white
petticoat
under
the
train
or
the
common
print
apron
of
dark
blue
figured
with
innumerable
little
white
stars
meant
anything
beyond
the
ordinary
adjuncts
of
a
traditional
old
woman
dress
but
when
in
the
second
scene
the
bonnet
went
on
an
ancient
marvel
of
exasperated
front
and
crown
pitched
over
the
forehead
like
an
enormous
helmet
and
decorated
upon
the
side
next
the
audience
with
black
and
white
eagle
plumes
springing
straight
up
from
the
fastening
of
an
american
shield
above
all
when
the
dog
himself
appeared
dressed
in
his
clothes
a
cane
an
white
collar
and
a
natty
little
tie
a
pair
of
tasseled
kid
gloves
dangling
from
his
left
paw
and
a
small
monitor
hat
with
a
big
spread
eagle
stuck
above
the
brim
the
remaining
details
of
costume
being
of
no
consequence
when
he
stood
reading
the
news
from
a
huge
bulletin
latest
by
cable
from
europe
nobody
could
mistake
the
personification
of
old
and
young
america
it
had
cost
much
pains
and
many
dainty
morsels
to
drill
sir
charles
with
all
the
aid
of
his
excellent
fundamental
education
and
the
great
fear
had
been
that
he
might
fail
them
at
the
last
but
the
scenes
were
rapid
in
consideration
of
canine
infirmity
if
the
cupboard
was
empty
mother
hubbard
basket
behind
was
not
he
got
his
morsels
duly
and
the
audience
was
requested
to
refrain
from
applause
until
the
end
refrain
from
laughter
they
could
not
as
the
idea
dawned
upon
them
and
developed
but
sir
charles
was
used
to
that
in
the
execution
of
his
ordinary
tricks
he
could
hardly
have
done
without
it
better
than
any
other
old
actor
a
dog
knows
when
he
is
having
his
day
to
say
nothing
of
doing
his
duty
and
these
things
are
as
sustaining
to
him
as
to
anybody
this
state
of
his
mind
manifest
in
his
air
helped
also
to
complete
the
young
america
expression
mother
hubbard
mingled
consternation
and
pride
at
each
successive
achievement
of
her
astonishing
puppy
were
inimitable
each
separate
illustration
made
its
point
patriotism
especially
came
in
when
the
undertaker
bearing
the
pall
with
border
rebellion
finds
the
dog
with
upturned
knowing
eye
and
parted
jaws
suggestive
as
much
of
a
good
grip
as
of
laughter
half
risen
upon
as
far
from
dead
as
ever
mounting
guard
over
the
old
bone
constitution
the
curtain
fell
at
last
amid
peals
of
applause
and
calls
for
the
actors
dakie
thayne
had
accompanied
with
the
reading
of
the
ballad
slightly
transposed
and
adapted
as
leslie
led
sir
charles
before
the
curtain
in
response
to
the
continued
demand
he
added
the
concluding
stanza
the
dame
made
a
courtesy
the
dog
made
a
bow
the
dame
said
servant
the
dog
said
which
with
a
suppressed
speak
sir
from
frank
scherman
was
brought
properly
to
pass
done
with
cleverness
and
quickness
from
beginning
to
end
and
taking
the
audience
utterly
by
surprise
leslie
little
combination
of
wit
and
sagacity
had
been
throughout
a
signal
success
the
actors
crowded
round
her
we
no
idea
of
it
capital
a
great
hit
they
exclaimed
mother
hubbard
is
the
star
of
the
evening
said
leonard
brookhouse
no
indeed
returned
leslie
patting
sir
head
this
is
the
rather
a
sirius
reflection
upon
the
rest
of
us
rejoined
brookhouse
shrugging
his
shoulders
as
he
walked
off
to
take
his
place
in
the
oath
and
leslie
disappeared
to
make
ready
for
barbara
frietchie
several
persons
before
and
behind
the
curtain
were
making
up
their
minds
just
now
to
a
fresh
opinion
there
was
nothing
so
very
slow
or
tame
after
all
about
leslie
goldthwaite
several
others
had
known
that
long
ago
taking
the
oath
was
piquant
and
spirited
the
touch
of
restive
scorn
that
could
come
out
on
martha
josselyn
face
just
suited
her
part
and
leonard
brookhouse
was
very
cool
and
courteous
and
handsome
and
as
the
union
officer
barbara
frietchie
was
grand
grahame
lowe
played
stonewall
jackson
they
had
improvised
a
pretty
bit
of
scenery
at
the
back
with
a
few
sticks
some
paint
brown
and
a
couple
of
mosquito
bars
a
dutch
gable
with
a
lattice
window
vines
trained
up
over
it
and
bushes
below
it
was
a
moving
tableau
enacted
to
the
reading
of
glorious
ballad
only
an
old
woman
in
a
cap
and
kerchief
putting
her
head
out
at
a
garret
window
that
was
all
but
the
fire
was
in
the
young
eyes
under
the
painted
wrinkles
and
the
snowy
hair
the
arm
stretched
itself
out
quick
and
bravely
at
the
very
instant
of
the
that
startled
timid
ears
one
skillful
movement
detached
and
seized
the
staff
in
its
apparent
fall
and
the
flashed
full
in
rebel
faces
as
the
broken
lower
fragment
went
clattering
to
the
stage
all
depended
on
the
one
instant
action
and
expression
these
were
perfect
the
very
spirit
of
barbara
stirred
her
representative
the
curtain
began
to
descend
slowly
and
the
applause
broke
forth
before
the
reading
ended
but
a
hand
held
up
hushed
it
till
the
concluding
lines
were
given
in
thrilling
tones
as
the
tableau
was
covered
from
sight
barbara
frietchie
work
is
and
the
rebel
rides
on
his
raids
no
more
honor
to
her
and
let
a
tear
fall
for
her
sake
on
stonewall
bier
over
barbara
frietchie
grave
flag
of
freedom
and
union
wave
peace
and
order
and
beauty
draw
round
thy
symbol
of
light
and
law
and
ever
the
stars
above
look
down
on
thy
stars
below
in
frederick
town
then
one
great
cheer
broke
forth
and
was
prolonged
to
three
not
be
barbara
frietchie
leslie
would
not
have
missed
that
thrill
for
the
finest
of
all
for
the
applause
that
was
for
the
flag
of
course
as
ginevra
thoresby
said
the
benches
were
slid
out
at
a
window
upon
a
lower
roof
the
curtain
was
looped
up
and
the
footlights
carried
away
the
music
came
up
and
took
possession
of
the
stage
and
the
audience
hall
resolved
itself
into
a
under
the
chandelier
in
the
middle
a
tableau
not
set
forth
in
the
programme
was
rehearsed
and
added
a
few
minutes
after
thoresby
of
course
had
been
introduced
to
the
general
thoresby
with
her
bright
full
gray
curls
and
her
handsome
figure
stood
holding
him
in
conversation
between
introductions
graciously
waiving
her
privilege
as
new
comers
claimed
their
modest
word
thoresby
took
possession
had
praised
the
tableaux
as
quite
creditable
really
considering
the
resources
we
had
and
was
following
a
slight
lead
into
a
long
talk
of
information
and
advice
on
her
part
about
dixville
notch
the
general
thought
he
should
go
there
after
a
day
or
two
at
outledge
just
here
came
up
dakie
thayne
the
actors
in
costume
were
gradually
mingling
among
the
audience
and
barbara
frietchie
in
white
hair
from
which
there
was
not
time
to
remove
the
powder
plain
cap
and
kerchief
and
brown
woolen
gown
with
her
silken
flag
yet
in
her
hand
came
with
him
this
boy
who
was
always
everywhere
made
no
hesitation
but
walked
straight
up
to
the
central
group
taking
leslie
by
the
hand
close
to
the
general
he
waited
courteously
for
a
long
sentence
of
thoresby
to
be
ended
and
then
said
simply
uncle
james
this
is
my
friend
miss
leslie
goldthwaite
my
brother
ingleside
why
where
is
noll
oliver
ingleside
had
stepped
out
of
the
circle
in
the
last
half
of
the
long
sentence
the
sister
of
mercy
no
longer
in
costume
however
had
come
down
the
little
flight
of
steps
that
led
from
the
stage
to
the
floor
at
their
foot
the
young
army
surgeon
was
shaking
hands
with
susan
josselyn
these
two
had
had
the
together
and
other
practice
down
there
among
the
southern
hospitals
thoresby
face
was
very
like
some
fabric
subjected
to
chemical
experiment
from
which
one
color
and
aspect
has
been
suddenly
and
utterly
discharged
to
make
room
for
something
different
and
new
between
the
first
and
last
there
waits
a
blank
with
this
blank
full
upon
her
she
stood
there
for
one
brief
unprecedented
instant
in
her
life
a
figure
without
presence
or
effect
i
have
seen
a
daguerreotype
in
which
were
cap
hair
and
collar
quite
correct
what
should
have
been
a
face
rubbed
out
thoresby
rubbed
herself
out
and
so
performed
her
involuntary
tableau
of
course
i
might
have
guessed
i
wonder
it
never
occurred
to
me
linceford
was
replying
presently
to
her
vacuous
inquiry
the
name
seemed
familiar
too
only
he
called
himself
i
remember
perfectly
now
old
jacob
thayne
the
chicago
millionaire
he
married
pretty
little
ingleside
the
illinois
representative
widow
that
first
winter
i
was
in
washington
why
dakie
must
be
a
dollar
prince
he
was
just
dakie
thayne
though
for
all
that
he
and
leslie
and
cousin
delight
the
josselyns
and
the
inglesides
dear
miss
craydocke
hurrying
up
to
congratulate
marmaduke
wharne
looking
on
without
a
shade
of
cynicism
in
the
gladness
of
his
face
and
sin
saxon
and
frank
scherman
flitting
up
in
the
pauses
of
dance
and
promenade
well
after
all
these
were
the
central
group
that
night
the
pivot
of
the
little
solar
system
was
changed
but
the
chief
planets
made
but
slight
account
of
that
they
just
felt
that
it
had
grown
very
warm
and
bright
oh
chicken
little
linceford
cried
to
leslie
goldthwaite
giving
her
a
small
shake
with
her
kiss
at
her
door
how
did
you
know
the
sky
was
going
to
fall
and
how
have
you
led
us
all
this
chase
to
cheat
fox
lox
at
last
but
that
was
the
way
chicken
little
looked
at
it
she
did
care
much
for
the
bit
of
dramatic
that
had
come
about
by
accident
like
a
story
elinor
said
or
the
touch
of
poetic
justice
that
tickled
linceford
sense
of
fun
dakie
thayne
was
a
sum
that
needed
proving
it
was
very
nice
that
this
famous
general
should
be
his
uncle
but
not
at
all
strange
they
were
just
the
sort
of
people
he
belong
to
and
it
was
nicest
of
all
that
ingleside
and
susan
josselyn
should
have
known
each
other
in
the
glory
of
their
lives
she
phrased
it
to
herself
with
a
little
flash
of
girl
enthusiasm
and
a
vague
suggestion
of
romance
why
did
you
tell
us
linceford
said
to
dakie
thayne
next
morning
everybody
would
have
she
stopped
she
could
not
tell
this
boy
to
his
frank
face
that
everybody
would
have
thought
more
and
made
more
of
him
because
his
uncle
had
got
brave
stars
on
his
shoulders
and
his
father
had
died
leaving
two
millions
or
so
of
dollars
i
know
they
would
have
said
dakie
thayne
that
was
just
it
what
is
the
use
of
telling
things
i
wait
till
i
done
something
that
tells
itself
chapter
xvii
there
was
a
pretty
general
at
outledge
during
the
week
following
the
tableaux
were
the
of
the
season
gayety
of
this
particular
little
episode
at
least
which
grew
out
of
the
association
together
of
these
personages
of
our
story
there
might
come
a
later
set
and
later
doings
but
this
last
week
of
august
sent
the
mere
fluttering
madam
routh
must
be
back
in
new
york
to
prepare
for
the
reopening
of
her
school
linceford
had
letters
from
her
husband
proposing
to
meet
her
by
the
first
in
n
and
so
the
haddens
would
be
off
the
thoresbys
had
stayed
as
long
as
they
cared
to
in
any
one
place
where
there
seemed
no
special
inducement
general
ingleside
was
going
through
the
mountains
to
dixville
notch
rose
ingleside
bright
and
charming
as
her
name
just
a
fit
flower
to
put
beside
our
ladies
delight
finding
out
at
once
as
all
girls
and
women
did
her
sweetness
and
leaning
more
and
more
to
the
rare
and
delicate
sphere
of
her
quiet
attraction
oliver
and
dakie
thayne
these
were
his
family
party
but
there
came
to
be
question
about
leslie
and
delight
would
not
they
make
six
and
since
linceford
and
her
sisters
must
go
it
seemed
so
exactly
the
thing
for
them
to
fall
into
otherwise
miss
goldthwaite
journey
hither
would
hardly
seem
to
have
been
worth
while
early
september
was
so
lovely
among
the
hills
opportunities
for
a
party
to
dixville
notch
would
not
come
every
day
in
short
dakie
had
set
his
heart
upon
it
rose
begged
the
general
was
as
pressing
as
true
politeness
would
allow
and
it
was
settled
only
sin
saxon
said
suddenly
on
being
told
i
should
like
if
you
would
tell
me
general
ingleside
the
precise
military
expression
synonymous
with
the
wind
out
of
one
sails
because
just
what
you
done
for
me
my
dear
miss
saxon
in
what
way
invited
my
party
some
of
them
and
taken
my
road
that
all
i
spoke
first
though
i
did
speak
out
loud
see
here
and
she
produced
a
letter
from
her
mother
received
that
morning
observe
the
date
if
you
please
august
letter
reached
me
yesterday
and
it
had
traveled
round
as
usual
two
days
in
papa
pocket
beside
i
always
allow
for
that
quite
approve
your
plan
provided
as
you
say
the
party
be
properly
matronized
i
h
h
that
refers
to
little
explanations
of
my
own
well
all
is
i
was
going
to
do
this
very
thing
with
enlargements
and
now
miss
craydocke
and
i
may
collapse
why
when
with
you
and
your
enlargements
we
might
make
the
most
admirable
combination
at
least
the
dixville
road
is
open
to
all
very
kind
of
you
to
say
so
the
first
part
i
mean
if
you
could
possibly
have
helped
it
but
there
are
insurmountable
obstacles
on
that
dixville
road
to
us
there
a
lion
in
the
way
do
you
see
we
should
be
like
the
little
ragged
boys
running
after
the
we
could
think
of
putting
ourselves
in
that
light
especially
before
the
eyes
of
grundy
this
last
as
thoresby
swept
impressively
along
the
piazza
in
full
dinner
costume
unless
you
go
first
and
we
run
after
you
suggested
the
general
all
the
same
you
talked
dixville
to
her
the
very
first
evening
you
know
no
nobody
can
have
an
original
dixville
idea
any
more
and
been
asking
them
the
josselyns
and
wharne
and
all
and
was
just
coming
to
the
goldthwaites
and
now
i
got
them
on
my
hands
and
i
do
know
where
in
the
world
to
take
them
that
comes
of
keeping
an
inspiration
to
ripen
well
it
a
lesson
of
wisdom
only
as
effie
says
about
her
housekeeping
the
two
dearest
things
in
living
are
butter
and
experience
amidst
laughter
and
banter
and
repartee
they
came
to
it
of
course
the
most
delightful
combination
and
joint
arrangement
two
wagons
the
general
and
ingleside
two
frank
scherman
little
mountain
mare
that
climbed
like
a
cat
and
was
as
a
chamois
these
with
a
for
the
use
of
a
lady
sometimes
upon
the
last
made
up
the
general
equipment
of
the
expedition
all
grundy
knew
was
that
they
were
wonderfully
merry
and
excited
together
until
this
plan
came
out
as
the
upshot
the
josselyns
had
not
quite
consented
at
once
though
their
faces
were
bright
with
a
most
thankful
appreciation
of
the
kindness
that
offered
them
such
a
pleasure
nay
that
entreated
their
companionship
as
a
thing
so
genuinely
coveted
to
make
its
own
pleasure
complete
somehow
when
the
whole
plan
developed
there
was
a
little
sudden
shrinking
on
part
perhaps
on
similar
grounds
to
sin
saxon
perception
of
insurmountable
obstacles
but
she
was
shyer
than
sin
of
putting
forth
her
objections
and
the
general
zeal
and
delight
and
martha
longing
look
unconscious
of
cause
why
not
carried
the
day
there
had
never
been
a
blither
setting
off
from
the
giant
cairn
all
the
remaining
guests
were
gathered
to
see
them
go
there
was
not
a
mote
in
the
blue
air
between
outledge
and
the
crest
of
washington
all
the
subtile
strength
of
the
hills
ores
and
sweet
waters
and
resinous
perfumes
and
breath
of
healing
leaf
and
root
distilled
to
absolute
purity
in
the
clear
ether
that
sweeps
only
from
such
bare
summits
made
up
the
exhilarant
draught
in
which
they
drank
the
mountain
joy
and
received
afar
off
its
baptism
of
delight
it
was
beautiful
to
see
the
josselyns
so
girlish
and
gay
it
was
lovely
to
look
at
old
miss
craydocke
with
her
little
tremors
of
pleasure
and
the
sudden
glistenings
in
her
eyes
sin
saxon
pretty
face
was
clear
and
noble
with
its
pure
impulse
of
kindliness
and
her
fun
was
like
a
sparkle
upon
deep
waters
dakie
thayne
rushed
about
in
a
sort
of
general
satisfaction
which
would
not
let
him
be
quiet
anywhere
outsiders
looked
with
a
kind
of
new
respect
on
these
privileged
few
who
had
so
suddenly
become
the
general
party
sin
saxon
whispered
to
leslie
goldthwaite
it
neither
his
nor
mine
honeysuckle
yours
and
all
the
rest
of
it
as
linceford
said
leslie
was
glad
with
the
crowning
gladness
of
her
bright
summer
that
girl
has
played
her
cards
well
thoresby
said
of
her
a
little
below
her
voice
as
she
saw
the
general
himself
making
her
especially
comfortable
with
cousin
delight
in
a
back
seat
particularly
my
dear
madam
said
marmaduke
wharne
coming
close
and
speaking
with
clear
emphasis
as
she
could
not
possibly
have
known
that
she
had
a
trump
in
her
hand
to
tell
of
all
that
week
journeying
and
of
dixville
notch
the
adventure
the
brightness
the
beauty
and
the
glory
the
sympathy
of
abounding
enjoyment
the
waking
of
new
life
that
it
was
to
some
of
them
the
interchange
of
thought
the
cementing
of
friendships
would
be
to
begin
another
story
possibly
a
yet
longer
one
leslie
summer
according
to
the
calendar
is
already
ended
much
in
this
world
must
pause
unfinished
or
come
to
abrupt
conclusion
people
die
suddenly
at
last
after
the
most
tedious
illnesses
married
and
lived
happy
ever
after
is
the
inclusive
summary
that
winds
up
many
an
old
tale
whose
time
of
action
only
runs
through
hours
if
in
this
with
leslie
goldthwaite
your
thoughts
have
broadened
somewhat
with
hers
some
questions
for
you
have
been
partly
answered
if
it
has
appeared
to
you
how
a
life
enriches
itself
by
drawing
toward
and
going
forth
into
the
life
of
others
through
seeing
how
this
began
with
her
it
is
no
unfinished
tale
that
i
leave
with
you
a
little
picture
i
will
give
you
farther
on
a
hint
of
something
farther
yet
and
say
some
of
them
came
back
to
outledge
and
stayed
far
into
the
still
rich
september
delight
and
leslie
sat
before
the
green
cottage
one
morning
in
the
heart
of
a
golden
haze
and
a
gorgeous
bloom
all
around
the
feet
of
the
great
hills
lay
the
garlands
of
autumn
you
see
nothing
like
it
in
the
lowlands
nothing
like
the
fire
of
the
maples
the
of
the
oaks
the
flash
of
scarlet
sumachs
and
creepers
the
illumination
of
every
kind
of
little
leaf
in
its
own
way
upon
which
the
frost
touch
comes
down
from
those
tremendous
heights
that
stand
rimy
in
each
morning
sun
trying
on
white
caps
that
by
and
by
they
shall
pull
down
heavily
over
their
brows
till
they
cloak
all
their
shoulders
also
in
the
like
sculptured
folds
to
stand
and
wait
blind
awful
chrysalides
through
the
long
winter
of
their
death
and
silence
delight
and
leslie
had
got
letters
from
the
josselyns
and
dakie
thayne
there
was
news
in
them
such
as
thrills
always
the
sympathies
of
girlhood
leslie
vague
suggestion
of
romance
had
become
fulfillment
dakie
thayne
was
wild
with
rejoicing
that
dear
old
noll
was
to
marry
sue
she
had
always
made
him
think
of
noll
and
his
ways
and
likings
ever
since
that
day
of
the
game
of
chess
that
by
his
means
came
to
grief
it
was
awful
slang
but
he
could
not
help
it
it
was
just
the
very
jolliest
go
susan
josselyn
quiet
letter
said
that
kindness
which
kept
us
on
and
made
it
beautiful
for
us
strangers
at
outledge
has
brought
to
me
by
god
providence
this
great
happiness
of
my
life
after
a
long
pause
of
trying
to
take
it
in
leslie
looked
up
what
a
summer
this
has
been
so
full
so
much
has
happened
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
living
such
a
great
deal
you
have
been
living
in
others
lives
you
have
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
what
has
happened
oh
cousin
delight
i
have
only
been
it
i
could
not
except
such
a
very
little
there
is
a
working
from
us
beyond
our
own
but
if
our
working
runs
with
that
you
have
done
more
than
you
will
ever
know
little
one
delight
goldthwaite
spoke
very
tenderly
her
own
life
somehow
had
been
closely
touched
through
that
which
had
grown
and
gathered
about
leslie
it
depends
on
that
abiding
me
and
i
in
you
so
shall
ye
bear
much
fruit
she
stopped
she
would
not
say
more
leslie
thought
her
talking
rather
wide
of
the
first
suggestion
but
this
child
would
never
know
as
delight
had
said
what
a
centre
in
her
simple
loving
way
she
had
been
for
the
working
of
a
purpose
beyond
her
thought
sin
saxon
came
across
the
lawn
crowned
with
gold
and
scarlet
trailing
creepers
twined
about
her
shoulders
and
flames
of
beauty
in
her
full
hands
miss
craydocke
says
she
praised
god
with
every
leaf
she
took
i
afraid
i
forgot
to
for
the
little
ones
but
i
was
so
greedy
and
so
busy
getting
them
all
for
her
come
miss
craydocke
we
got
no
end
of
pressing
to
do
to
save
half
of
them
she
ca
do
enough
for
her
oh
cousin
delight
the
leaves
glorified
after
all
asenath
never
was
so
charming
and
she
is
more
beautiful
than
ever
delight
glance
took
in
also
another
face
than
asenath
grown
into
something
in
these
months
that
no
training
or
taking
thought
could
have
done
for
it
yes
she
said
in
the
same
still
way
in
which
she
had
spoken
before
that
comes
too
as
god
wills
all
things
shall
be
added
my
hint
is
of
a
western
home
just
outside
the
leaping
growth
and
ceaseless
stir
of
a
great
western
city
a
large
low
cosy
mansion
with
a
certain
old
world
mellowness
and
rest
in
its
aspect
looking
forth
even
as
it
does
on
one
side
upon
the
illimitable
sweep
of
the
magnificent
promise
of
the
new
on
the
other
it
catches
a
glimpse
beyond
and
beside
the
town
of
the
calm
blue
of
a
ocean
the
place

ingleside
the
general

call
it

no
other
than
the
