the

i
the
face
at
the
window
john
menzies
grant
having
breakfasted
filled
his
pipe
lit
it
and
strolled
out
into
the
garden
the
month
was
june
that
glorious
which
gladdened
england
before
darkened
the
summer
sky
as
the
hour
was
nine
it
is
highly
probable
that
many
thousands
of
men
were
then
strolling
out
into
many
thousands
of
gardens
in
precisely
similar
conditions
but
given
youth
good
health
leisure
and
a
fair
amount
of
money
it
is
even
more
probable
that
few
among
the
smaller
number
thus
roundly
favored
by
fortune
looked
so
perplexed
as
grant
moreover
his
actions
were
eloquent
as
words
a
spacious
french
window
had
been
cut
bodily
out
of
the
wall
of
an
room
and
was
now
thrown
wide
to
admit
the
breeze
between
this
window
and
the
angle
of
the
room
was
a
smaller
window
high
above
the
ground
level
and
deeply
fact
just
the
sort
of
window
which
one
might
expect
to
find
in
a
built
two
centuries
ago
when
light
and
air
were
rigorously
excluded
from
interiors
the
two
windows
told
the
history
of
at
a
glance
the
little
one
had
served
the
needs
of
a
room
for
several
generations
of
sussex
yeomen
then
had
come
some
iconoclast
who
hewed
a
big
rectangle
through
the
solid
converted
the
apartment
into
a
most
comfortable
built
a
new
wing
with
a
gable
changed
a
into
a
lawn
and
generally
played
havoc
with
georgian
utility
while
carrying
out
a
determined
scheme
of
landscape
gardening
happily
the
wrecker
was
content
to
let
well
enough
alone
after
enlarging
the
house
laying
turf
and
planting
shrubs
and
flowers
he
found
a
ramshackle
place
and
left
it
even
more
so
but
with
a
new
note
of
artistry
and
several
unexpectedly
charming
vistas
thus
the
big
double
window
opened
straight
into
an
irregular
garden
which
merged
insensibly
into
a
sloping
lawn
bounded
by
a
the
bank
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
rose
sharply
and
was
well
wooded
above
the
crest
showed
the
thatched
roofs
or
red
tiles
of
steynholme
which
was
a
village
in
the
time
of
william
the
conqueror
and
has
remained
a
village
ever
since
frame
this
picture
in
flowering
shrubs
evergreens
a
few
choice
firs
a
copper
beech
and
some
sturdy
oaks
shadowing
the
lawn
and
the
prospect
on
a
june
morning
might
well
have
led
out
into
the
open
any
young
man
with
a
pipe
but
john
menzies
grant
seemed
to
have
no
eye
for
a
scene
that
would
have
delighted
a
painter
he
turned
to
the
light
scrutinized
so
closely
a
strip
of
turf
which
ran
close
to
the
wall
that
he
might
have
been
searching
for
a
lost
diamond
and
then
peered
through
the
lowermost
pane
of
the
small
window
into
the
room
he
had
just
quitted
the
result
of
this
peeping
was
remarkable
in
more
ways
than
one
a
stout
elderly
woman
who
had
entered
the
room
soon
after
she
heard
chair
being
moved
caught
sight
of
the
intent
face
she
screamed
loudly
and
dropped
a
cup
and
saucer
with
a
clatter
on
to
a
japanese
tray
grant
hurried
back
to
the
french
window
in
his
haste
he
did
not
notice
a
long
shoot
of
a
dorothy
perkins
rose
which
trailed
across
his
path
and
it
struck
him
smartly
on
the
cheek
afraid
i
startled
you
bates
he
said
smiling
so
pleasantly
that
no
woman
or
child
could
fail
to
put
trust
in
him
did
that
sir
agreed
bates
collapsing
into
the
chair
grant
had
just
vacated
like
most
people
bates
turned
a
bluish
purple
when
alarmed
and
her
aspect
was
so
distressing
now
that
smile
was
banished
by
a
look
of
real
concern
very
sorry
he
said
contritely
had
no
notion
you
were
in
the
room
shall
i
call
minnie
minnie
it
may
be
explained
was
daughter
and
assistant
the
two
plus
a
whiskered
bates
gardener
and
groom
forming
the
domestic
establishment
presided
over
by
grant
sir
stuttered
the
housekeeper
stupid
of
me
but
not
so
young
as
i
was
me
heart
jumps
at
little
grant
saw
that
she
was
recovering
though
slowly
he
thought
it
best
not
to
make
too
much
of
the
incident
but
asked
solicitously
if
he
might
give
her
some
brandy
bates
remarked
that
she
was
so
bad
as
that
rose
valiantly
and
went
on
with
her
work
her
employer
who
had
gone
into
the
garden
again
saw
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
that
she
vanished
with
a
tray
in
a
couple
of
minutes
the
daughter
appeared
and
finished
the
slight
task
of
clearing
the
table
meanwhile
grant
kept
away
from
the
small
window
being
a
young
man
who
cultivated
the
habit
of
observation
he
noticed
that
minnie
too
cast
scared
glances
at
the
window
when
the
girl
had
finally
quitted
the
room
he
laughed
in
a
puzzled
way
i
dreaming
or
are
there
visions
about
he
murmured
urged
seemingly
by
a
sort
of
curiosity
he
surveyed
the
room
a
second
time
through
the
same
pane
of
glass
being
tall
he
had
to
stoop
slightly
within
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
ledge
he
saw
the
tiny
brass
candlestick
with
its
inch
of
candle
which
he
had
used
while
searching
for
a
volume
of
scott
in
the
lining
the
neighboring
wall
somehow
this
simplest
of
domestic
objects
brought
a
thrill
of
recollection
dash
it
all
he
growled
getting
nervy
i
must
chuck
this
bad
habit
of
working
late
and
use
the
blessed
hours
of
yet
as
he
sauntered
down
the
lawn
toward
the
stream
he
knew
well
that
he
would
do
nothing
of
the
sort
he
loved
that
time
of
peace
between
ten
at
night
and
one
in
the
morning
his
thoughts
ran
vagrom
then
fantasies
took
shape
under
his
pen
which
in
the
cold
light
of
morning
looked
unreal
and
nebulous
though
he
had
the
good
sense
to
restrain
criticism
within
strict
limits
and
corrected
style
rather
than
matter
he
was
a
writer
an
essayist
with
no
slight
leaven
of
the
poet
and
had
learnt
early
that
the
everyday
world
held
naught
in
common
with
the
brooding
of
the
soul
but
he
was
no
dreamer
of
impossible
things
erect
and
he
had
passed
through
sandhurst
into
the
army
a
profession
abandoned
because
of
its
humdrum
nature
when
an
unexpectedly
legacy
rendered
him
independent
he
looked
exactly
what
he
was
a
healthy
young
englishman
with
a
physique
that
led
to
occasional
bouts
of
and
alpine
climbing
and
a
taste
in
literature
that
brought
about
the
consumption
of
midnight
oil
this
latter
is
not
a
mere
trope
steynholme
is
far
removed
from
such
modern
as
gas
and
electricity
at
present
he
had
no
more
definite
object
in
life
than
to
watch
the
trout
rising
in
the
pool
he
held
the
fishing
rights
over
half
a
mile
of
a
noted
river
but
by
force
of
the
law
of
hospitality
as
it
were
the
stretch
of
water
bordering
the
lawn
was
a
finny
sanctuary
once
he
halted
and
looked
fixedly
at
a
dormer
window
in
a
cottage
just
visible
above
the
trees
on
the
opposite
slope
such
a
highly
presentable
young
man
might
well
expect
to
find
a
dainty
feminine
form
appearing
just
in
that
place
and
eke
return
the
greeting
of
a
waved
hand
but
the
window
remained
refused
to
yield
any
information
that
he
passed
on
the
lawn
dipped
gently
to
the
edge
until
the
turf
gave
way
to
pebbles
and
sand
in
that
spot
the
river
widened
and
deepened
until
its
current
was
hardly
perceptible
in
fine
weather
when
the
sun
was
in
the
west
the
trees
and
roofs
of
steynholme
were
so
clearly
reflected
in
the
mirror
of
the
pool
that
a
photograph
of
the
scene
needed
close
scrutiny
ere
one
could
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
being
held
upside
down
but
the
sun
shone
directly
on
the
water
now
so
the
shelving
bottom
was
visible
and
quick
eye
was
drawn
to
a
rope
trailing
into
the
depths
and
fastened
to
an
iron
staple
driven
firmly
into
the
shingle
he
was
so
surprised
that
he
spoke
aloud
in
the
world
is
that
he
almost
gasped
a
premonition
of
evil
was
so
strong
in
him
that
he
actually
gazed
in
stupefaction
at
a
blob
of
water
and
a
ring
where
a
fat
trout
rose
lazily
in
midstream
somehow
too
he
resisted
the
first
impulse
of
the
active
side
of
his
temperament
and
did
not
instantly
tug
at
the
rope
instead
he
shouted
bates
an
answering
hail
came
from
behind
a
screen
of
laurels
on
the
right
of
the
house
there
lay
the
stables
and
bates
would
surely
be
grooming
the
cob
which
supplied
a
connecting
link
between
and
the
railway
for
the
neighboring
bates
came
a
sturdy
block
of
a
man
who
might
have
been
hewn
out
of
a
sussex
oak
his
face
hands
and
arms
were
the
color
of
oak
and
he
moved
with
a
stiffness
that
suggested
wooden
joints
evidently
he
expected
an
order
for
the
dogcart
and
stood
stock
still
when
he
reached
the
lawn
but
grant
who
had
gathered
his
wits
summoned
him
with
crooked
forefinger
and
bates
jerked
slowly
on
ye
done
to
yer
face
sir
he
inquired
grant
was
surprised
he
expected
no
such
question
far
as
i
know
not
been
making
any
great
alteration
in
it
he
said
all
covered
blood
came
the
disturbing
statement
a
handkerchief
soon
gave
evidence
that
bates
was
not
exaggerating
is
it
madam
perkins
can
scratch
as
well
as
look
sweet
and
a
thorn
had
opened
a
small
vein
in
cheek
which
bled
to
a
surprising
extent
it
is
nothing
he
said
remember
rose
shoot
caught
me
as
i
went
back
into
the
a
moment
ago
i
shouted
for
you
to
come
and
see
soon
the
two
were
examining
the
rope
and
the
staple
who
put
there
said
bates
not
asking
a
question
but
rather
stating
a
thesis
was
not
here
yesterday
commented
his
master
accepting
all
that
words
implied
sir
that
it
i
was
the
lawn
till
nigh
it
there
grant
was
himself
again
he
stooped
and
grabbed
the
rope
we
solve
the
mystery
he
said
need
to
dirty
your
hands
sir
put
in
bates
i
haul
in
a
few
seconds
the
oaken
tint
in
his
face
grew
many
shades
lighter
gawd
he
wheezed
at
the
end
of
the
rope
was
the
body
of
a
woman
there
are
few
more
distressing
objects
than
a
drowned
corpse
on
that
bright
june
morning
a
dreadful
apparition
lost
little
of
its
grim
repulsiveness
because
the
body
was
that
of
a
young
and
woman
if
one
searched
england
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
two
men
of
differing
temperaments
less
likely
to
yield
to
the
stress
of
even
the
most
trying
circumstance
than
grant
and
bates
yet
during
some
agonized
moments
the
one
of
tried
courage
and
fine
mettle
was
equally
horrified
and
shaken
as
the
other
a
gnarled
and
rustic
it
was
he
from
whom
speech
might
least
be
expected
who
first
found
his
tongue
bates
who
had
stooped
straightened
himself
slowly
gum
he
said
be
a
bad
business
grant
who
is
she
none
of
our
steynholme
still
grant
uttered
no
word
he
just
looked
in
horror
at
the
poor
husk
of
a
woman
who
in
life
had
undoubtedly
been
beautiful
she
was
well
but
quietly
dressed
and
her
clothing
showed
no
signs
of
violence
the
soaking
in
the
river
revealed
some
pitiful
little
feminine
secrets
such
as
a
touch
of
on
lips
and
cheeks
and
the
dark
roots
of
abundant
hair
which
had
been
treated
chemically
to
lighten
its
color
the
eyes
were
closed
and
for
that
grant
was
conscious
of
a
deep
thankfulness
had
those
sightless
eyes
stared
at
him
he
felt
he
would
have
cried
aloud
in
terror
the
firm
lips
were
open
as
though
uttering
a
last
protest
against
an
untimely
fate
of
course
both
men
were
convinced
that
murder
had
been
done
not
only
were
arms
and
body
bound
in
a
manner
that
was
impossible
of
accomplishment
by
the
dead
woman
herself
but
an
ugly
wound
on
the
smooth
forehead
seemed
to
indicate
that
she
had
been
stunned
or
killed
outright
before
being
flung
into
the
river
and
then
the
rope
and
the
staple
suggested
an
outlandish
maniacal
disposal
of
the
victim
here
was
no
effort
at
concealment
but
rather
a
making
sure
in
most
brutal
and
callous
fashion
that
early
discovery
must
be
unavoidable
the
bucolic
mind
works
in
grooves
receiving
no
assistance
from
his
master
bates
pulled
the
body
a
little
farther
up
on
the
strip
of
gravel
so
that
it
lay
clear
of
the
water
mum
fetch
polis
he
said
the
phrase
with
its
vivid
significance
seemed
to
galvanize
grant
into
a
species
of
comprehension
he
agreed
speaking
slowly
as
though
striving
to
measure
the
effect
of
each
word
go
for
the
police
bates
this
foul
crime
must
be
inquired
into
no
matter
who
suffers
go
now
but
first
bring
a
rug
from
the
stable
you
understand
your
wife
or
minnie
must
not
be
told
till
later
they
must
not
see
bates
is
not
so
well
so
well
her
ate
a
rare
good
breakfast
for
a
sick
bates
was
recovering
from
the
shock
and
prepared
once
more
to
take
an
interest
in
the
minor
features
of
existence
among
these
he
counted
ability
to
eat
as
a
sure
sign
of
continued
in
man
or
beast
grant
too
was
slowly
regaining
poise
hardly
know
what
i
am
saying
he
muttered
any
rate
bring
a
rug
mount
guard
till
you
return
with
the
policeman
there
can
be
no
doubt
i
suppose
that
this
poor
creature
is
as
a
stone
said
bates
with
conviction
bin
in
there
hours
and
he
nodded
toward
the
water
if
i
knows
anythink
of
a
crack
on
her
wur
outed
before
she
went
into
but
who
can
she
be
you
fetch
that
rug
go
for
it
myself
said
grant
whereupon
bates
made
off
he
was
soon
back
again
with
a
carriage
rug
which
grant
helped
him
to
spread
over
the
dripping
body
then
he
hastened
to
the
village
taking
a
path
that
avoided
the
house
the
lawn
and
river
bank
of
could
only
be
overlooked
from
the
steep
wooded
cliff
opposite
and
none
but
an
adventurous
boy
would
ever
think
of
climbing
down
that
almost
impassable
rampart
of
rock
brushwood
and
at
any
rate
when
left
alone
with
the
ghastly
evidence
of
a
tragedy
grant
troubled
only
to
satisfy
himself
that
no
one
was
watching
from
the
house
assured
on
that
point
he
lifted
a
corner
of
the
rug
and
apparently
forced
himself
to
scrutinize
the
dead
face
he
seemed
to
search
therein
for
some
reassuring
token
but
found
none
because
he
shook
his
head
dropped
the
rug
and
walked
a
few
paces
dejectedly
then
hardly
knowing
what
he
was
about
he
relighted
his
pipe
but
had
hardly
put
it
in
his
mouth
before
he
knocked
out
the
tobacco
clearly
he
was
thinking
hard
mapping
out
some
line
of
conduct
and
the
outlook
must
have
been
dark
indeed
judging
by
his
somber
and
undecided
aspect
more
than
once
he
looked
up
at
the
attic
window
of
the
cottage
which
had
drawn
his
eyes
before
tragedy
had
come
so
swiftly
to
his
very
feet
but
if
he
hoped
to
see
anyone
he
was
disappointed
though
in
the
event
it
proved
that
his
real
fear
was
lest
the
person
he
half
expected
to
see
should
look
out
he
was
not
disturbed
in
that
way
however
fish
rose
in
the
river
birds
sang
in
the
trees
a
skipped
nimbly
from
rock
to
rock
in
the
shallows
bees
hummed
past
to
the
many
hives
in
the
garden
these
were
the
normal
sights
and
sounds
of
a
june
which
was
abnormal
and
almost
grotesque
in
its
horror
lay
hidden
beneath
the
carriage
rug
to
and
fro
he
walked
in
that
trying
vigil
carrying
the
empty
pipe
in
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
dabbed
the
handkerchief
at
the
cut
on
his
face
he
was
aware
of
some
singular
change
in
the
quality
of
the
sunlight
pouring
down
on
lawn
and
river
and
trees
five
minutes
earlier
it
had
spread
over
the
landscape
a
golden
bloom
of
the
tint
of
champagne
now
it
was
sharp
and
cold
a
clear
penetrating
radiance
in
which
colors
were
vivid
and
shadows
black
he
was
in
no
mood
to
analyze
emotions
or
he
might
have
understood
that
the
fierce
throbbing
of
his
heart
had
literally
thinned
the
blood
in
his
veins
and
thus
affected
even
his
sight
he
only
knew
that
in
this
crystal
atmosphere
the
major
issues
of
life
presented
themselves
with
a
new
and
crude
force
at
any
rate
he
made
up
his
mind
that
the
course
suggested
by
truth
and
honor
was
the
only
one
to
follow
and
that
in
itself
was
something
gained
by
the
time
bates
returned
accompanied
by
the
village
policeman
and
two
other
men
carrying
a
stretcher
grant
was
calmer
more
than
he
had
been
since
that
hapless
body
was
dragged
from
the
depths
he
was
not
irresponsive
therefore
to
the
aura
of
official
importance
which
enveloped
the
policeman
he
sensed
a
certain
uneasiness
in
bates
he
even
noted
that
the
stretcher
was
part
of
the
stock
in
trade
of
hobbs
the
local
butcher
and
ordinarily
bore
the
carcase
of
a
pig
these
details
were
helpful
naturally
bates
had
explained
his
errand
and
the
law
in
the
person
of
the
policeman
was
prepared
for
all
eventualities
is
a
bad
business
grant
began
the
policeman
producing
a
and
moistening
the
tip
of
a
lead
pencil
with
his
tongue
being
a
sussex
man
he
used
the
same
phrase
as
bates
in
fact
grant
was
greeted
by
it
a
score
of
times
that
day
agreed
grant
had
better
tell
you
that
i
have
recognized
the
poor
lady
her
name
is
adelaide
melhuish
her
residence
is
in
the
park
district
of
robinson
the
policeman
permitted
himself
to
look
surprised
he
was
in
fact
rather
annoyed
story
had
prepared
him
for
a
detective
mystery
it
was
irritating
to
have
one
of
its
leading
features
cleared
up
so
promptly
he
said
drawing
a
line
under
the
last
entry
in
the
and
writing
the
date
and
hour
in
heavy
characters
beneath
or
single
but
separated
from
her
husband
when
last
i
had
news
of
when
was
that
sir
three
years
you
have
not
seen
her
since
see
her
last
night
grant
positively
started
but
he
looked
at
the
policeman
squarely
is
strange
you
should
ask
me
that
he
said
night
while
searching
for
a
book
i
saw
a
face
at
the
window
it
was
that
window
and
four
pairs
of
eyes
followed
his
pointing
finger
face
i
now
believe
was
that
of
the
dead
woman
at
the
moment
as
it
vanished
instantly
i
persuaded
myself
that
i
was
the
victim
of
some
trick
of
the
imagination
still
i
opened
the
other
window
looked
out
and
listened
but
heard
or
saw
nothing
or
no
one
as
i
say
i
fancied
i
had
imagined
that
which
was
not
now
i
know
i
was
what
would
this
be
grant
before
eleven
i
came
in
at
a
quarter
past
ten
and
began
to
work
after
writing
steadily
for
a
little
more
than
half
an
hour
i
wanted
to
consult
a
book
and
lighted
a
candle
which
i
keep
for
that
purpose
i
found
the
book
and
was
about
to
blow
out
the
candle
when
i
saw
the
robinson
wrote
in
his
to
to
investigate
case
of
supposed
murder
body
of
woman
found
in
river
grant
occupying
says
that
name
is
adelaide
this
point
he
paused
to
ascertain
the
he
saw
her
face
at
a
window
of
the
house
at
last
sir
and
what
next
he
went
on
seems
to
me
that
the
next
thing
is
to
have
the
unfortunate
lady
removed
to
some
more
suitable
place
than
the
river
bank
said
grant
rather
impatiently
story
can
wait
and
so
can
he
knows
all
that
i
know
and
has
probably
told
you
already
how
we
came
to
discover
the
body
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
she
must
have
been
murdered
it
is
an
extraordinary
i
may
even
say
a
phenomenal
crime
which
certainly
can
not
be
investigated
here
and
now
i
advise
you
to
have
the
body
taken
to
the
village
mortuary
or
such
other
place
as
serves
local
needs
in
that
respect
and
summon
a
doctor
then
if
you
and
an
inspector
will
call
here
give
you
all
the
information
i
possess
which
is
very
little
i
may
robinson
began
solemnly
to
jot
down
a
summary
of
words
and
thereby
stirred
the
owner
of
to
a
fury
which
was
repressed
with
difficulty
realizing
however
the
absolute
folly
of
expressing
any
resentment
grant
turned
and
without
meaning
it
looked
again
in
the
direction
of
the
cottage
on
the
crest
of
the
opposite
bank
this
time
a
girl
was
leaning
out
of
the
dormer
window
she
had
shaded
her
eyes
with
a
hand
because
the
sun
was
streaming
into
her
face
but
when
she
saw
that
grant
was
looking
her
way
she
waved
a
handkerchief
he
fluttered
his
own
handkerchief
in
brief
acknowledgment
and
wheeled
about
only
to
find
robinson
watching
him
furtively
having
suspended
his
for
the
purpose
chapter
ii
robinson
a
will
help
me
a
lot
sir
he
said
you
tell
me
now
what
you
know
about
this
matter
if
as
seems
more
than
likely
murder
has
been
done
i
want
to
lose
a
minute
in
starting
my
inquiries
in
a
case
of
this
sort
i
find
it
best
to
take
a
line
and
stick
to
his
tone
was
respectful
but
firm
evidently
robinson
was
not
one
to
be
trifled
with
moreover
for
a
sleuth
whose
maximum
achievement
hitherto
had
been
the
successful
prosecution
of
a
poultry
thief
it
was
significant
that
the
unconscious
irony
of
case
of
this
should
have
been
lost
on
him
you
really
insist
on
conducting
your
investigation
while
the
body
is
lying
here
demanded
grant
deliberately
turning
his
back
on
the
girl
in
the
distant
cottage
that
i
must
really
ask
you
to
clear
up
one
or
two
points
sake
what
are
they
sir
in
the
first
place
how
did
you
come
to
find
the
body
walked
out
into
the
garden
after
finishing
breakfast
a
few
minutes
ago
and
noticed
the
rope
attached
to
the
staple
just
as
you
see
it
you
walk
straight
here
not
exactly
i
about
the
face
i
saw
or
thought
i
saw
last
night
and
looked
into
the
room
through
the
same
window
by
doing
so
i
scared
bates
who
was
clearing
the
table
and
she
would
too
put
in
bates
take
for
owd
shut
up
bates
said
the
policeman
interrupt
grant
was
conscious
of
an
undercurrent
of
suspicion
in
the
manner
he
was
wroth
with
the
man
but
recognized
that
he
had
to
deal
with
so
contrived
again
to
curb
his
temper
am
not
acquainted
with
old
ben
or
his
ghost
he
said
quietly
can
only
tell
you
that
i
went
inside
to
reassure
bates
and
then
strolled
slowly
to
this
very
spot
naturally
i
could
not
miss
the
rope
and
the
staple
to
my
mind
it
was
not
intended
that
i
or
anyone
else
should
miss
them
i
regarded
them
as
so
peculiar
that
i
shouted
for
bates
he
came
at
once
and
drew
the
body
out
of
the
you
recognized
the
dead
woman
as
the
one
you
saw
last
night
about
ten
minutes
to
eleven
it
likely
sir
that
any
other
person
saw
her
in
these
grounds
a
bit
earlier
do
you
mean
sir
i
put
it
much
plainer
could
anybody
else
have
seen
her
here
say
about
grant
met
the
inquiring
glance
squarely
before
he
answered
is
possible
of
course
he
said
most
you
alone
here
at
that
hour
again
grant
sought
and
held
that
inquisitive
gaze
held
it
until
robinson
affected
to
consult
his
notes
there
was
a
moment
of
tense
silence
then
the
reply
came
with
an
icy
stubbornness
that
was
not
to
be
denied
decline
absolutely
to
be
about
my
movements
if
you
are
unable
or
unwilling
to
order
the
removal
of
the
body
telegraph
to
the
chief
of
police
at
knolesworth
and
ask
him
to
act
further
i
shall
request
foxton
to
examine
the
poor
injuries
it
strikes
me
as
a
monstrous
proceeding
that
you
should
attempt
to
record
my
evidence
at
this
moment
and
i
refuse
to
become
a
party
to
then
robinson
stop
yer
sherlock
holmes
work
help
me
to
lift
this
poor
woman
on
to
the
stretcher
said
bates
gruffly
the
red
face
grew
a
shade
deeper
with
annoyance
but
he
had
the
sense
to
avoid
a
scene
he
was
not
popular
in
the
village
and
was
well
aware
that
the
two
rustics
pressed
into
service
as
would
joyfully
retail
the
fact
that
he
had
been
down
a
peg
or
two
by
do
all
necessary
in
that
way
sir
he
said
stiffly
suppose
you
have
no
objection
to
my
if
you
noticed
any
strange
footprints
on
the
ground
hereabouts
was
the
first
thing
i
looked
for
both
here
and
outside
the
latter
of
course
for
another
reason
i
found
none
these
stones
would
show
no
signs
the
ground
is
so
dry
that
even
the
five
men
now
present
leave
no
traces
but
i
remember
seeing
in
the
bed
of
the
stream
certain
marks
which
unfortunately
were
obliterated
when
bates
hauled
the
body
ashore
they
were
valueless
indentations
in
the
mud
and
they
wide
apart
or
close
together
sir
irregular
no
one
could
judge
by
the
length
of
the
stride
whether
they
were
made
by
the
feet
of
a
man
or
a
woman
if
that
is
what
you
have
in
mind
but
impatient
motion
was
not
to
be
misunderstood
robinson
stooped
removed
the
rug
and
unfastened
the
rope
after
noting
carefully
how
it
was
tied
a
point
which
he
called
on
the
others
to
observe
as
well
then
he
and
the
villagers
went
away
with
their
sad
burden
the
rug
being
requisitioned
once
more
to
hide
that
wan
face
from
the
vivid
sunshine
bates
had
a
trick
of
grasping
a
handful
of
his
short
whiskers
when
puzzled
he
did
so
now
it
seemed
to
be
an
unconscious
effort
to
pull
his
jaws
apart
in
order
to
emit
speech
a
sort
of
idee
sir
he
said
slowly
robinson
saw
doris
martin
on
the
lawn
with
last
grant
turned
on
his
henchman
in
a
sudden
heat
of
anger
name
must
be
kept
out
of
this
matter
he
growled
but
sussex
is
not
easily
browbeaten
when
it
thinks
itself
in
the
right
very
well
that
sir
but
of
it
is
a
bird
of
another
color
argued
bates
firmly
did
you
know
that
miss
martin
was
here
your
heart
sir
how
comes
it
that
us
steynholme
folk
know
everythink
about
other
business
sometimes
we
know
they
knows
themselves
not
walked
a
yard
doris
that
the
made
it
into
a
no
man
even
the
wisest
likes
to
be
told
an
unpalatable
truth
for
a
few
seconds
grant
was
seriously
annoyed
with
this
village
solon
and
nearly
blurted
out
an
angry
command
that
he
should
hold
his
tongue
luckily
since
bates
was
only
trying
to
be
helpful
he
was
content
to
say
sarcastically
course
if
you
are
so
well
posted
in
my
movements
last
night
you
can
assure
the
coroner
and
the
police
that
i
did
not
strangle
some
strange
woman
tie
a
rope
around
her
and
throw
her
in
the
my
missis
help
you
doris
at
the
stars
through
a
spyglass
when
us
were
to
bed
persisted
bates
heerd
your
voices
quite
plain
once
fixed
the
glass
low
down
said
serious
late
i
tell
straight
sir
i
said
to
the
missis
will
be
serious
all
if
father
catches
her
in
our
garden
grant
nigh
on
ten
soon
after
that
took
doris
as
far
as
the
bridge
the
window
was
open
i
heerd
your
footsteps
on
the
road
you
in
closed
the
window
drew
a
chair
up
to
the
table
after
that
i
fell
perturbed
and
anxious
though
he
was
grant
could
hardly
fail
to
see
that
bates
meant
well
by
him
the
mental
effort
needed
for
such
a
long
speech
said
as
much
the
allusion
to
sirius
amusing
at
any
other
time
was
now
most
valuable
because
an
astronomical
almanac
would
give
the
hour
at
which
that
brilliant
star
became
visible
other
considerations
yielded
at
once
however
to
the
fear
lest
robinson
and
his
were
already
busy
at
the
post
office
without
another
word
he
hurried
away
by
the
through
the
evergreens
leaving
bates
staring
after
him
and
with
more
examining
the
rope
and
staple
which
by
the
order
were
not
to
be
disturbed
grant
reached
the
highroad
just
as
robinson
and
the
men
with
the
stretcher
were
crossing
a
stone
bridge
spanning
the
river
about
a
hundred
yards
below
a
slight
youthful
and
eminently
attractive
female
figure
walking
swiftly
in
the
opposite
direction
came
in
sight
at
the
same
time
and
grant
almost
groaned
aloud
when
the
newcomer
stood
stock
still
and
looked
at
the
mournful
procession
he
be
it
remembered
was
somewhat
of
an
idealist
and
a
poet
it
grieved
his
spirit
that
those
two
women
the
quick
and
the
dead
should
meet
on
the
bridge
he
took
it
as
a
portent
almost
a
menace
he
knew
not
of
what
he
might
have
foreseen
that
unhappy
eventuality
and
prevented
it
but
his
brain
refused
to
work
clearly
that
morning
a
terrible
and
bizarre
crime
had
bemused
his
faculties
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
state
of
waking
nightmare
he
was
stung
into
impetuous
action
by
seeing
the
policeman
halt
and
exchange
some
words
with
the
girl
he
began
to
run
with
the
quite
definite
if
equally
mad
intent
of
punching
robinson
into
reasonable
behavior
he
was
saved
from
an
act
of
unmitigated
folly
by
the
girl
herself
she
caught
sight
of
him
apparently
broke
off
her
talk
with
the
policeman
abruptly
and
in
her
turn
took
to
her
heels
thus
on
that
strip
of
road
with
its
easy
gradient
to
the
crown
of
the
bridge
there
was
the
curious
spectacle
offered
by
two
men
jogging
along
with
a
corpse
on
a
stretcher
a
young
man
and
a
young
woman
running
towards
each
other
and
a
discomfited
representative
of
the
law
looking
now
one
way
and
now
the
other
and
evidently
undecided
whether
to
go
on
or
return
ultimately
it
would
seem
robinson
went
with
the
because
grant
and
the
girl
saw
no
more
of
him
for
the
time
grant
had
received
several
shocks
since
rising
from
the
but
it
was
left
for
doris
martin
the
daughter
to
administer
not
the
least
surprising
one
though
almost
breathless
and
with
horror
her
opening
words
were
very
much
to
the
point
awful
she
cried
should
in
steynholme
want
to
kill
a
great
actress
like
adelaide
melhuish
now
the
name
of
the
dead
woman
was
literally
the
last
thing
grant
expected
to
hear
from
this
lips
and
the
astounding
fact
momentarily
banished
all
other
worries
knew
her
he
gasped
not
exactly
but
i
avoid
recognizing
her
when
she
asked
for
her
letters
and
sent
a
robinson
told
me
she
was
dead
i
see
now
what
is
puzzling
is
not
quite
that
i
mean
why
you
tell
me
she
was
in
steynholme
has
she
been
staying
here
any
length
of
time
the
pretty
face
crimsoned
and
then
grew
pale
no
friend
of
yours
grant
she
stammered
used
to
be
a
friend
but
i
have
not
set
eyes
on
her
during
the
past
three
last
night
you
had
gone
home
i
was
doing
some
work
and
having
occasion
to
consult
a
book
lighted
a
candle
and
put
it
in
the
small
window
near
the
bookcase
then
i
fancied
i
saw
a
face
face
peering
in
and
was
so
obsessed
by
the
notion
that
i
went
outside
but
everything
was
so
still
that
i
persuaded
myself
i
was
is
that
what
it
was
grant
threw
out
his
hands
in
a
gesture
that
was
eloquent
of
some
feeling
distinctly
akin
to
despair
usually
speak
in
enigmas
doris
he
said
in
the
world
do
you
mean
by
saying
is
that
what
it
was
the
was
only
nineteen
and
never
before
had
aught
of
tragic
mystery
entered
her
sheltered
to
recover
her
with
a
quickness
and
decision
that
were
admirable
is
no
enigma
she
said
calmly
room
overlooks
your
lawn
before
retiring
for
the
night
i
went
to
the
window
just
to
have
another
peep
at
sirius
and
its
changing
lights
so
i
could
not
help
seeing
you
fling
open
the
french
windows
stand
a
little
while
on
the
step
and
go
in
you
saw
that
then
i
have
one
witness
who
will
help
to
dispel
that
stupid
notion
that
i
killed
miss
melhuish
and
hid
her
body
in
the
river
at
the
foot
of
the
lawn
hid
it
with
such
care
that
the
first
passerby
must
find
every
human
being
has
three
distinct
personalities
firstly
there
is
the
man
or
woman
as
he
or
she
really
is
secondly
there
is
the
much
superior
individual
as
assessed
personally
thirdly
and
perhaps
the
most
important
in
the
general
scheme
of
things
there
is
the
same
individuality
as
viewed
by
others
for
an
instant
the
somewhat
idealized
figure
which
john
menzies
grant
offered
to
a
pretty
and
intelligent
but
inexperienced
girl
was
in
danger
of
losing
its
impressiveness
but
since
grant
was
not
only
a
good
fellow
but
a
gentleman
his
next
thought
restored
him
to
the
pedestal
from
which
all
unknowing
he
had
nearly
been
dethroned
is
a
nice
thing
to
say
he
cried
with
a
short
laugh
of
sheer
vexation
am
i
regarding
you
as
a
witness
in
my
behalf
whereas
my
chief
worry
is
to
keep
you
out
of
this
ugly
business
altogether
forgive
me
doris
never
before
have
i
been
so
bothered
honestly
i
imagined
i
an
enemy
in
the
world
yet
someone
has
tried
deliberately
to
saddle
me
with
suspicion
in
this
affair
not
that
i
would
give
real
heed
to
that
consideration
if
it
were
not
for
the
unhappy
probability
that
strive
as
i
may
your
name
will
crop
up
in
connection
with
it
what
sort
of
fellow
is
this
police
constable
do
you
think
he
would
keep
his
mouth
shut
if
i
paid
him
well
grant
was
certainly
far
from
being
in
his
normal
state
of
mind
or
he
would
have
caught
the
tender
gleam
which
lighted
the
eyes
when
she
understood
that
his
concern
was
for
her
not
for
himself
as
it
was
several
things
had
escaped
him
during
that
brief
talk
on
the
sunlit
road
on
her
part
doris
martin
was
now
in
full
control
of
her
emotions
and
she
undoubtedly
took
a
saner
view
of
a
difficult
situation
is
a
vain
man
she
said
thoughtfully
will
not
let
go
the
chance
of
notoriety
given
him
by
the
murder
of
a
actress
was
she
really
murdered
robinson
said
so
when
i
met
him
on
the
afraid
he
is
justified
in
that
belief
at
any
grant
what
have
we
to
conceal
i
was
in
your
garden
at
a
rather
late
hour
i
admit
but
one
can
not
watch
the
stars
by
day
and
a
big
telescope
with
its
tripod
is
not
easily
carried
about
of
course
father
will
be
vexed
because
as
it
happens
i
did
not
tell
him
i
was
coming
out
but
that
can
not
be
helped
as
it
happens
i
can
fix
the
time
you
opened
your
window
almost
to
a
minute
because
the
church
clock
had
chimed
the
quarter
just
before
you
grant
however
was
not
to
be
soothed
by
this
reasoning
am
vexed
at
the
mere
notion
of
your
name
and
possibly
your
portrait
appearing
in
the
newspapers
he
protested
melhuish
was
a
celebrated
actress
the
press
will
make
a
rare
commotion
about
her
death
look
at
the
obvious
questions
that
will
be
raised
what
was
she
doing
here
why
was
she
found
in
the
river
bordering
the
grounds
of
my
house
you
see
i
had
to
decide
pretty
quickly
whether
or
not
i
would
admit
any
previous
knowledge
of
her
i
suppose
i
acted
rightly
hide
anything
grant
surely
it
is
always
best
to
tell
the
truth
he
looked
into
those
candid
blue
eyes
and
drew
from
their
limpid
depths
an
element
of
strength
and
fortitude
jove
doris
small
wonder
if
a
jaded
man
of
the
world
such
as
i
was
when
i
came
to
steynholme
found
new
faith
and
inspiration
in
friendship
with
you
he
said
gratefully
i
am
all
the
time
this
morning
it
would
seem
you
come
into
the
house
if
we
have
to
discuss
a
tragedy
we
may
as
well
sit
down
to
she
said
with
the
promptitude
of
one
who
had
anticipated
the
invitation
must
hurry
home
there
are
accounts
to
be
made
up
and
robinson
and
others
will
be
telegraphing
to
knoleworth
and
london
i
must
attend
to
all
that
because
dad
gets
flustered
if
several
messages
are
handed
in
at
the
same
and
have
tea
then
about
four
the
ravens
will
have
fled
by
ravens
police
you
dear
child
and
the
reporters
and
the
flock
of
weird
fowl
which
gathers
from
all
points
of
the
compass
when
the
press
gets
hold
of
what
is
called
story
by
midday
i
shall
be
in
the
thick
of
it
but
thank
goodness
they
will
know
nothing
to
draw
them
your
way
until
the
inquest
takes
place
and
not
even
then
if
can
manage
mind
me
grant
you
must
not
keep
anything
back
on
my
account
try
and
come
at
four
but
i
may
be
very
busy
in
the
office
by
the
way
you
ought
to
know
miss
melhuish
came
here
on
sunday
evening
she
arrived
by
the
train
from
london
to
notice
her
as
she
passed
in
the
hare
and
bus
she
took
a
room
there
at
the
inn
i
mean
and
came
to
the
post
office
twice
yesterday
when
i
heard
her
name
i
recognized
her
at
once
from
her
photographs
more
guessed
there
was
something
wrong
when
i
saw
you
and
robinson
and
bates
and
the
other
men
standing
near
a
body
lying
close
to
the
river
that
is
why
i
came
out
now
i
really
must
go
she
hastened
away
grant
stood
in
the
road
and
looked
after
her
apparently
she
was
conscious
that
he
had
not
stirred
because
when
she
reached
the
bridge
she
turned
and
waved
a
hand
to
him
she
was
exceedingly
graceful
in
all
her
movements
she
wore
a
simple
white
linen
blouse
and
short
white
skirt
that
morning
with
brown
shoes
and
stockings
which
harmonized
with
the
deeper
tints
of
her
titian
red
hair
as
she
paused
on
the
bridge
for
a
second
or
two
silhouetted
against
the
sky
she
suggested
to
troubled
mind
the
spirit
of
summer
returning
to
the
house
by
way
of
the
main
gate
which
gave
on
to
the
highway
he
bethought
him
of
bates
and
minnie
they
must
be
enlightened
and
warned
as
to
the
certain
influx
of
visitors
he
resolved
now
to
tackle
a
displeasing
task
boldly
realizing
that
the
worst
possible
policy
lay
in
denying
himself
to
the
representatives
of
the
press
who
would
simply
ascertain
the
facts
from
other
sources
and
unconsciously
adopt
a
critical
vein
with
regard
to
himself
he
determined
to
go
to
the
other
extreme
and
receive
all
comers
of
course
there
would
be
reservations
in
his
story
that
is
what
every
man
decides
who
faces
a
legal
inquiry
as
a
novice
it
is
a
decision
too
often
regretted
in
the
light
of
after
events
meanwhile
robinson
was
hard
at
work
in
his
own
phrase
he
a
line
and
the
trend
of
his
thoughts
was
clearly
demonstrated
when
a
superintendent
motored
over
from
knoleworth
in
response
to
a
telegram
he
told
how
the
body
had
been
found
and
then
went
into
details
gathered
in
the
interim
melhuish
been
in
the
village
five
minutes
he
said
she
asked
tomlin
landlord
of
the
hare
and
hounds
where
was
and
how
long
grant
had
lived
in
the
village
she
went
for
a
walk
in
the
direction
of
his
house
almost
at
once
tomlin
watched
her
until
she
crossed
the
bridge
that
was
on
sunday
superintendent
fowler
allowed
his
placid
features
to
show
a
flicker
of
surprise
in
that
rural
district
an
actual
downright
murder
was
almost
unknown
even
a
case
of
manslaughter
arising
out
of
a
drunken
quarrel
between
laborers
at
did
not
occur
once
in
five
years
she
came
here
on
sunday
did
she
he
asked
sir
yesterday
too
she
spoke
of
grant
to
hobbs
the
butcher
and
siddle
the
the
two
were
closeted
in
the
of
cottage
which
was
situated
on
the
main
road
near
the
bridge
it
faced
the
short
steep
hill
overhanging
the
river
a
triangular
strip
of
turf
formed
the
village
green
and
the
houses
of
steynholme
clustered
around
this
and
a
side
road
climbing
the
hill
from
door
and
windows
nearly
every
shop
and
residence
in
the
village
proper
could
be
seen
in
front
of
the
hare
and
hounds
had
gathered
a
group
of
men
and
it
was
easy
to
guess
the
topic
they
were
discussing
the
superintendent
who
did
not
know
any
of
them
had
no
difficulty
in
identifying
hobbs
who
looked
a
butcher
and
was
dressed
like
one
or
tomlin
who
was
either
born
an
innkeeper
or
had
been
coached
in
the
part
by
a
stage
expert
a
thin
person
pallid
and
wearing
a
morning
coat
and
striped
trousers
must
surely
be
siddle
while
a
fourth
the
youngest
there
and
of
rather
sporting
guise
was
apparently
a
farmer
of
a
turn
is
that
fellow
in
the
leggings
inquired
the
superintendent
irrelevantly
he
was
looking
through
the
window
and
robinson
considered
that
the
question
showed
a
lack
of
interest
in
his
statement
though
he
dared
not
hint
at
such
a
thing
a
elkin
sir
he
said
i
was
does
elkin
make
a
living
broke
in
the
other
breeds
hacks
and
polo
ponies
said
robinson
rather
shortly
i
thought
so
well
go
on
with
your
robinson
was
irritated
and
justly
so
his
superior
had
put
him
off
his
he
took
it
up
again
sharply
leaving
out
of
court
for
the
moment
the
various
rills
of
evidence
which
in
his
opinion
united
into
a
stream
fact
is
sir
he
blurted
out
is
an
uncommonly
strong
case
against
john
menzies
whistled
the
superintendent
think
agree
with
me
sir
when
you
hear
what
gathered
about
him
one
way
and
robinson
was
sure
of
his
audience
now
quite
unconsciously
he
had
applied
the
chief
canon
of
realism
in
art
he
had
conveyed
his
effect
by
one
striking
note
the
rest
of
the
picture
was
quite
subsidiary
to
the
bold
splurge
of
color
evoked
by
actually
naming
the
man
he
suspected
of
murdering
adelaide
melhuish
chapter
iii
the
gathering
clouds
thus
it
befell
that
grant
was
not
worried
by
officialdom
until
long
after
his
housekeeper
and
her
daughter
had
recovered
from
the
shock
of
learning
that
they
were
in
a
sense
connected
at
first
hand
with
a
ghastly
and
sensational
crime
like
bates
and
their
employer
neither
bates
nor
minnie
had
heard
or
seen
anything
overnight
which
suggested
that
a
woman
was
being
foully
done
to
death
in
the
grounds
attached
to
the
house

it
happened
bedroom
as
well
as
that
occupied
by
her
parents
overlooked
the

and

room
lay
in
a
gable
which
commanded
the
entrance
he
had
chosen
it
purposely
because
it
faced
the
rising
sun
the
other
members
of
the
household
therefore
though
in
bed
had
quite
as
good
an
opportunity
as
he
working
in
the
beneath
of
having
their
attention
drawn
to
sounds
disturbing
the
peace
of
the
night
in
a
quiet
and
secluded
spot
moreover
none
of
them
was
asleep
minnie
bates
in
particular
said
that
the
in
the
hall
struck
twelve
before
she
close
an

last
just
as
grant
was
rising
from
an
almost
untasted
luncheon
bates
with
a
voice
of
scare
announced
polis
and
robinson
introduced
superintendent
fowler
this
time
grant
did
not
resent
questions
he
expected
them
and
had
made
up
his
mind
to
give
full
and
detailed
answers
of
course
the
finding
of
the
body
was
again
described
minutely
the
superintendent
a
man
of
experience
one
whose
manner
was
not
and
irritating
like
his
paid
close
attention
to
the
face
at
the
window
seems
to
be
little
room
for
doubt
that
miss
melhuish
did
enter
your
grounds
about
a
quarter
to
eleven
last
night
he
said
thoughtfully
recognized
her
at
once
you
say
imagined
so
until
this
horrible
thing
became
known
i
had
persuaded
myself
that
the
vision
was
a
piece
of
sheer
us
assume
that
the
lady
actually
came
here
and
looked
in
evidently
her
face
was
sufficiently
familiar
that
you
should
know
instantly
who
this
unusual
visitor
was
i
understand
though
that
you
had
not
the
least
notion
she
was
staying
in
steynholme
the
long
ago
is
it
since
you
last
saw
her
three
were
very
well
acquainted
with
her
then
or
you
could
not
have
glanced
up
from
your
table
seen
someone
staring
at
you
through
a
window
and
said
to
yourself
as
one
may
express
it
is
adelaide
were
so
well
acquainted
that
i
asked
the
lady
to
be
my
said
the
superintendent
his
placid
unemotional
features
however
gave
no
clew
to
his
opinions
not
so
robinson
who
tried
to
look
like
a
judge
whereas
he
really
resembled
a
who
has
literally
not
figuratively
smelt
a
rat
despite
his
earlier
good
resolutions
grant
was
horribly
impatient
of
this
inquisition
he
admitted
that
the
superintendent
was
carrying
through
an
unpleasant
duty
as
inoffensively
as
possible
but
the
attitude
of
the
village
policeman
was
irritating
in
the
extreme
nothing
would
have
tended
so
effectively
to
relieve
his
surcharged
feelings
as
to
supply
robinson
then
and
there
with
ample
material
for
establishing
a
charge
of
assault
and
battery
is
not
a
remarkable
fact
if
regarded
apart
from
tragedy
he
said
and
there
was
more
than
a
hint
of
in
his
voice
melhuish
was
a
very
talented
and
attractive
woman
i
first
met
her
as
the
outcome
of
a
suggestion
that
one
of
my
books
should
be
dramatized
a
character
in
the
novel
being
deemed
eminently
suitable
for
her
special
rôle
on
the
stage
the
idea
came
to
nothing
she
was
appearing
in
a
successful
play
at
the
time
and
was
rehearsing
its
successor
meanwhile
in
love
with
her
i
suppose
and
she
certainly
encouraged
me
in
the
belief
that
she
might
accept
me
i
did
eventually
propose
marriage
then
she
told
me
she
was
married
already
it
was
a
painful
the
time
i
only
saw
her
to
speak
to
once
she
reveal
her
name
the
superintendent
looked
grave
that
was
a
professional
trick
of
his
he
had
never
before
in
his
life
heard
of
ingerman
but
encouraged
the
notion
that
this
gentleman
was
thoroughly
and
not
quite
favorably
known
to
him
sometimes
it
happened
that
a
witness
interpreting
this
sapient
look
by
the
light
of
his
or
her
personal
and
intimate
knowledge
would
blurt
out
certain
facts
good
or
bad
as
the
case
might
be
concerning
the
person
under
discussion
but
grant
remained
obstinately
silent
as
to
the
qualities
of
this
doubtful
ingerman
so
fowler
scribbled
the
name
in
a
and
was
particular
as
to
whether
it
ended
in
one
or
two
still
he
carried
other
shots
in
his
locker
in
fact
fowler
had
he
taken
in
youth
to
nicer
legal
subtleties
than
handcuffs
and
summonses
would
have
become
a
shrewd
lawyer
leave
ingerman
for
the
moment
he
said
implying
of
course
that
on
returning
to
him
there
might

that
you
and
miss
melhuish
did
not
agree

i
put
it
as
to
the
precise
bearing
of
the
marriage
tie
on
your
love
affair

quite

your

but
his
questioner
was
by
no

no

acquaintance

the

but
i
have
always

say
more

the

as
it
were
for
applying
the

were

to

second
effort
is
more

superintendent
he
said
dryly
melhuish
did
urge
me
to
obtain
her
freedom
it
was
she
thought
only
a
matter
of
money
with
ingerman
and
she
would
be
given
material
for
a
murmured
fowler
again
as
though
the
discreditable
implication
fitted
in
exactly
with
the
life
history
of
a
noted
scoundrel
in
a
written
then
lying
in
his
office
objected
may
i
suggest
to
that
somewhat
doubtful
means
of
settling
a
difficulty
of
the
assuredly
grant
did
not
feel
disposed
to
lay
bare
his
secret
feelings
before
this
persuasive
superintendent
and
an
absurdly
conceited
village
constable
love
to
him
was
an
ideal
a
blend
of
mortal
passion
and
immortal
fire
but
the
flame
kindled
on
that
secret
altar
had
scorched
and
seared
his
soul
in
a
wholly
unforeseen
way
the
discovery
that
adelaide
melhuish
was
another
wife
had
stunned
him
it
was
not
until
the
fire
of
sacrifice
had
died
into
parched
ashes
that
its
earlier
banality
became
clear
he
realized
then
that
he
had
given
his
love
to
a
phantom
by
one
of
miracles
a
vain
and
selfish
creature
was
gifted
in
the
artistic
portrayal
of
the
finer
emotions
he
had
worshiped
the
actress
the
mimic
not
the
woman
herself
at
any
rate
that
was
how
he
read
the
repellent
notion
that
he
should
bargain
with
any
man
for
the
sale
of
a
wife
might
be
a
trifle
more
explicit
grant
said
the
superintendent
almost
reproachfully
what
direction
surely
a
love
affair
can
have
little
practical
bearing
on
miss
death
then
may
i
ask
could
bear
on
it
more
forcibly
the
lady
admittedly
visits
you
late
at
night
and
is
found
dead
in
a
river
bordering
the
grounds
of
your
house
next
morning
all
the
conditions
pointing
directly
to
murder
is
no
secret
as
the
truth
must
come
out
at
the
had
passed
a
good
deal
of
her
time
while
in
steynholme
unknown
to
you
in
making
inquiries
concerning
you
your
habits
your
surroundings
your
friends
surely
grant
you
must
see
that
the
history
of
your
relations
with
this
lady
though
if
i
may
use
the
phrase
perfectly
innocent
may
possibly
supply
that
which
is
at
present
clew
shall
i
term
it
to
the
motive
which
inspired
the
man
or
woman
who
killed
her
robinson
was
all
an
eye
and
an
ear
for
this
verbal
it
was
not
that
he
admired
his
skill
because
such
finesse
was
wholly
beyond
him
but
his
suspicious
brain
was
storing
up
admissions
be
used
in
against
him
subsequently
his
own
brief
record
of
the
conversation
would
have
been
prisoner
after
being
duly
cautioned
said
he
kept
company
with
the
deceased
about
three
years
ago
but
quarreled
with
her
on
hearing
that
she
was
a
married
the
superintendent
seldom
indulged
in
so
long
a
speech
but
he
was
determined
to
force
his
guard
and
sought
to
win
his
confidence
by
describing
the
probable
course
to
be
pursued
by
the
inquest
but
grant
like
the
dead
actress
had
two
sides
to
his
nature
he
was
both
an
idealist
and
a
stubborn
fighter
and
ideality
had
been
shattered
for
many
a
day
by
that
grewsome
object
hauled
in
that
morning
from
the
depths
of
the
river
am
willing
to
help
in
any
shape
or
form
but
can
only
repeat
that
miss
melhuish
and
i
parted
as
described
i
should
add
that
i
have
never
to
my
knowledge
met
her
may
be
you
may
know
more
about
him
than
then
we
have
not
traveled
far
as
fowler
was
puzzled
and
did
not
hesitate
to
show
it
he
believed
not
without
reasonable
cause
that
this
young
man
was
concealing
some
element
in
the
situation
which
might
prove
helpful
in
the
quest
for
the
murderer
he
resolved
to
strike
off
along
a
new
track
am
informed
he
went
on
speaking
with
a
deliberateness
meant
to
be
impressive
you
did
entertain
another
lady
as
a
visitor
last
grant
allowed
his
glance
to
dwell
on
robinson
for
an
instant
hitherto
he
had
ignored
the
man
now
he
surveyed
him
as
if
he
were
a
viper
will
be
a
peculiarly
offensive
thing
if
the
personality
of
a
helpless
and
unoffending
girl
is
brought
into
this
inquiry
he
cried
is
too
ought
to
say
as
it
happens
astronomy
is
one
of
my
hobbies
last
evening
as
the
outcome
of
a
chat
on
the
subject
doris
martin
daughter
of
the
local
postmaster
came
here
to
view
sirius
through
an
astronomical
telescope
there
is
the
instrument
and
he
pointed
through
robinson
to
a
telescope
on
a
tripod
in
a
corner
of
the
room
the
gesture
was
eloquent
the
burly
policeman
might
have
been
a
sheet
of
glass
you
see
it
is
a
solid
article
not
easily
lifted
about
it
weighs
nearly
a
is
it
so
heavy
the
superintendent
had
a
knack
of
putting
seemingly
irrelevant
questions
robinson
had
been
disconcerted
by
it
earlier
in
the
day
but
grant
seemed
to
treat
the
interruption
as
a
sensible
one
observation
purposes
an
astronomical
telescope
is
not
of
much
use
unless
the
movement
of
the
earth
is
counteracted
he
said
the
dome
of
an
observatory
swings
on
a
specially
contrived
axis
but
that
is
a
very
expensive
structure
so
my
telescope
is
governed
by
a
clockwork
attachment
and
moves
on
its
own
fowler
nodded
he
was
really
a
very
well
informed
man
for
a
country
he
understood
clearly
martin
came
here
about
a
quarter
to
ten
continued
grant
left
within
of
an
hour
she
did
not
enter
the
house
she
was
watching
sirius
while
i
explained
the
methods
whereby
the
distance
of
any
star
from
the
earth
is
computed
and
its
chemical
analysis
instructive
sure
put
in
the
superintendent
he
smiled
genially
so
genially
that
grant
dismissed
the
notion
that
the
other
might
in
vulgar
parlance
be
pulling
his
leg
that
is
the
and
of
miss
presence
it
would
be
cruel
and
unfair
if
a
girl
of
her
age
were
forced
into
a
distasteful
prominence
in
connection
with
a
crime
with
which
she
is
no
more
related
than
with
sirius
the
older
man
shook
his
head
in
regretful
dissent
is
just
where
you
and
i
differ
he
said
very
point
leads
us
back
to
your
past
friendship
with
the
dead
you
see
grant
that
miss
melhuish
might
be
probably
was
watching
your
especially
as
your
pupil
chanced
to
be
shall
i
say
a
remarkably
attractive
young
lady
no
no
for
anger
was
does
no
good
to
blaze
out
in
protest
an
unhappy
combination
of
circumstances
must
be
faced
candidly
here
are
you
and
a
pretty
girl
together
in
a
garden
at
a
rather
late
hour
and
a
woman
whom
you
once
wanted
to
marry
spying
on
you
in
all
likelihood
met
a
few
juries
in
my
time
and
not
one
of
them
but
would
deem
the
coincidence
strange
to
put
it
in
name
are
you
driving
at
must
not
impute
motives
sir
i
am
seeking
them
not
supplying
what
am
i
to
say
you
will
now
tell
me
just
how
miss
melhuish
and
you
the
fencers
were
coming
to
close
quarters
even
robinson
had
to
admit
that
his
had
cornered
the
suspect
rather
cleverly
grant
realized
that
there
was
no
room
for
squeamishness
in
this
affair
if
he
did
not
speak
out
now
his
motives
might
be
woefully
misunderstood
parted
in
wrath
and
tears
he
said
sadly
melhuish
could
not
or
did
not
appreciate
my
scruples
she
professed
to
be
in
love
with
me
she
even
went
so
far
as
to
threaten
suicide
believed
in
her
sincerity
but
thought
it
advisable
to
temporize
and
asked
for
a
few
delay
before
we
came
to
a
final
decision
we
met
again
as
i
have
said
and
discussed
matters
in
calmer
mood
ultimately
she
professed
agreement
with
my
point
of
view
and
we
parted
ostensibly
to
remain
good
friends
but
really
to
separate
for
you
better
what
your
point
of
view
grant
i
have
made
it
clear
i
could
not
regard
my
wife
as
purchasable
the
proposed
compact
was
i
believe
illegal
but
that
consideration
did
not
sway
me
i
had
been
dreaming
and
thought
i
was
roaming
in
an
enchanted
garden
i
awoke
and
found
myself
in
a
the
superintendent
nodded
again
singularly
enough
somewhat
simile
appeared
to
satisfy
his
craving
for
light
you
mind
telling
there
another
woman
he
demanded
with
one
of
those
rapid
transitions
of
topic
in
which
he
excelled
said
grant
see
what
i
am
aiming
at
let
us
suppose
that
miss
melhuish
never
in
her
own
mind
abandoned
the
hope
that
some
day
the
tangle
would
straighten
itself
women
are
constituted
that
way
if
her
husband
is
now
dead
and
she
became
free
she
might
wish
to
renew
the
old
ties
but
being
proud
would
want
to
ascertain
first
whether
or
not
any
other
woman
had
come
into
your
follow
perfectly
said
grant
with
some
bitterness
would
be
consumed
with
jealousy
because
my
companion
in
the
garden
last
night
happened
to
be
a
charming
girl
of
is
she
went
off
and
got
someone
to
kill
her
and
tie
her
body
with
a
rope
and
arrange
a
dramatic
setting
whereby
it
would
be
patent
to
the
meanest
intelligence
that
i
was
the
criminal
fowler
smiled
and
looked
fixedly
at
robinson
no
he
said
quite
would
be
carrying
realism
to
extremes
still
i
am
convinced
grant
that
this
mystery
is
bound
up
in
some
way
with
your
romance
of
three
years
ago
at
present
i
admit
i
am
working
in
the
he
rose
apparently
the
interview
was
at
an
end
but
while
pocketing
his
he
said
suddenly
inquest
will
open
at
three
tomorrow
you
will
be
present
of
course
grant
suppose
it
is
yes
you
found
the
body
you
know
besides
you
may
be
the
only
person
who
can
give
evidence
of
identity
in
fact
you
and
the
doctor
will
be
the
only
witnesses
foxton
he
made
a
is
doing
so
now
you
see
there
is
clear
indication
that
this
unfortunate
lady
was
struck
a
heavy
blow
perhaps
killed
before
she
was
put
in
the
heavens
somehow
i
was
so
stunned
that
i
never
thought
of
looking
for
signs
of
any
injury
of
that
air
was
so
spontaneous
that
it
probably
justified
the
severe
test
of
that
unexpected
disclosure
he
was
so
unnerved
by
it
that
the
two
policemen
had
gone
before
he
could
frame
another
question
once
they
were
in
the
open
road
and
well
away
from
robinson
ventured
to
open
his
mouth
a
clever
one
is
grant
he
said
meaningly
handled
him
a
bit
of
all
right
sir
but
he
tell
you
everything
he
knew
not
by
long
the
superintendent
walked
a
few
yards
in
silence
even
when
he
spoke
his
gaze
was
introspective
and
seemed
to
ignore
his
companion
inclined
to
agree
with
you
robinson
he
said
speaking
very
slowly
have
a
big
case
in
our
hands
a
very
big
case
we
must
tread
warily
you
in
particular
mixing
with
the
village
folk
should
listen
to
all
but
say
nothing
depend
on
your
memory
write
down
what
you
hear
and
see
actual
words
and
the
exact
time
of
an
occurrence
often
have
an
extraordinarily
illuminating
effect
when
weighed
subsequently
but
let
grant
think
you
suspect
him
there
is
no
occasion
for
fowler
could
be
either
blunt
or
cryptic
in
speech
at
will
in
one
mood
he
was
the
straightforward
outspoken
official
in
another
the
potential
lawyer
robinson
though
unable
to
describe
his
erratic
qualities
was
unpleasantly
aware
of
them
he
was
not
quite
sure
for
instance
whether
the
superintendent
was
encouraging
or
warning
him
but
being
a
dogged
person
resolved
to
his
own
line
and
stick
to
it
grant
passed
a
distressful
day
work
was
not
to
be
thought
of
and
reading
was
frankly
impossible
his
mind
dwelt
constantly
on
the
tragedy
which
had
come
so
swiftly
and
completely
into
his
ordered
life
he
could
not
wholly
discard
the
nebulous
theory
suggested
by
superintendent
fowler
but
the
more
he
surveyed
it
the
less
reasonable
it
seemed
the
one
outstanding
fact
in
a
chaos
of
doubt
was
that
someone
had
deliberately
done
adelaide
melhuish
to
death
the
murderer
had
been
actuated
by
a
motive
what
was
that
motive
surely
in
a
place
like
steynholme
no
man
could
come
and
go
without
being
seen
and
the
murderer
must
be
a
stranger
to
the
district
because
it
was
ridiculous
to
imagine
that
he
was
one
of
the
residents
yet
that
was
exactly
what
a
dunderheaded
policeman
believed
robinson
had
revealed
himself
by
many
a
covert
glance
and
movement
grant
squirmed
uneasily
at
the
crass
conceit
as
there
was
no
denying
that
circumstances
tended
towards
a
certain
doubt
if
no
more
in
regard
to
his
own
association
with
the
crime
the
admission
called
for
a
fierce
struggle
with
his
pride
but
he
forced
himself
to
think
the
problem
out
in
all
its
bearings
and
the
folly
of
adopting
the
legendary
policy
of
the
chased
ostrich
became
manifest
what
then
should
he
do
he
thought
at
first
of
invoking
the
aid
of
a
barrister
friend
who
could
watch
the
inquest
in
his
behalf
nevertheless
he
shrank
from
that
step
which
to
his
nature
implied
the
need
of
legal
protection
and
he
fiercely
resented
the
mere
notion
of
such
a
thing
but
something
must
be
done
once
the
murderer
was
laid
by
the
heels
his
own
troubles
would
vanish
and
the
storm
raised
by
the
unhappy
fate
of
adelaide
melhuish
would
subside
into
a
sad
memory
he
was
wrestling
with
indecision
when
a
newspaper
reporter
called
grant
received
the
journalist
promptly
and
told
him
all
the
salient
facts
suppressing
only
the
prospect
of
a
marriage
between
himself
and
the
famous
actress
the
reporter
went
with
him
to
the
river
and
scrutinized
the
marks
now
rapidly
becoming
obliterated
of
the
body
having
been
drawn
ashore
rope
and
iron
staple
i
understand
were
taken
from
the
premises
of
a
man
who
lets
boats
for
hire
on
the
dam
quarter
of
a
mile
away
he
said
casually
grant
was
astounded
at
his
own
failure
to
make
any
inquiry
whatsoever
concerning
this
vital
matter
he
laughed
grimly
can
imagine
the
state
of
my
mind
he
said
i
assure
you
that
until
this
moment
it
never
occurred
to
me
even
to
ask
where
these
articles
came
from
or
what
had
become
of
can
sympathize
with
you
said
the
journalist
brutal
murder
seems
horribly
out
of
place
in
this
environment
it
is
a
mysterious
business
altogether
i
wonder
if
scotland
yard
will
take
it
grant
surprised
him
by
clapping
him
on
the
back
jove
my
friend
the
very
thing
of
course
such
an
investigation
requires
bigger
brains
than
our
local
police
are
endowed
with
scotland
yard
take
it
up
wire
there
at
once
if
necessary
pay
all
the
newspaper
man
had
his
doubts
the
he
said
acted
in
the
provinces
only
if
appealed
to
by
the
authorities
directly
concerned
but
grant
was
not
to
be
stayed
by
a
trifle
like
that
he
hurried
to
the
post
office
hoping
that
doris
martin
might
walk
back
with
him
the
girl
and
her
father
were
busy
behind
the
counter
when
he
entered
he
noticed
that
doris
was
rather
pale
she
was
about
to
attend
to
him
but
martin
intervened
it
struck
grant
that
the
postmaster
was
purposely
preventing
his
daughter
from
speaking
to
him
for
some
inexplicable
reason
he
felt
miserably
and
was
content
to
write
a
message
to
the
chief
commissioner
of
police
london
asking
that
a
skilled
detective
should
be
sent
forthwith
to
steynholme

the

the
requisite
stamps
in
the

grant
quitted
the
place
without
exchanging
a
word
with
doris
while
her
father
usually
a
chatty
man
said
not
a
syllable
beyond
what
was
barely
needed
as
he
passed
down
the
hill
and
by
the
side
of
the
green
he
was
aware
of
being
covertly
watched
by
many
eyes
he
saw
robinson
peering
from
behind
a
curtained
window
siddle
the
chemist
came
to
the
shop
door
and
looked
after
him
hobbs
the
butcher
ceased
sharpening
a
knife
and
gazed
out
tomlin
landlord
of
the
hare
and
hounds
inn
surveyed
him
from
the
these
things
were
not
gracious
indeed
they
were
positively
maddening
he
went
home
gave
an
emphatic
order
that
no
one
except
miss
martin
if
she
called
was
to
be
admitted
and
savagely
buried
himself
in
a
treatise
on
but
that
day
of
events
had
not
finished
for
him
yet
he
had
perforce
eaten
a
good
meal
and
was
thinking
of
going
to
the
post
office
in
order
to
clear
up
an
undoubted
misapprehension
in
mind
when
minnie
bates
came
with
a
card
you
please
sir
said
the
girl
gentleman
is
very
pressing
he
says
sure
give
him
an
interview
when
you
see
his
so
grant
looked
and
read
isidor
ingerman
chambers
london
chapter
iv
a
cabal
grant
stared
again
at
the
card
a
tiny
silver
bell
seemed
to
tinkle
a
sort
of
warning
in
a
recess
of
his
brain
the
name
was
not
engraved
in
but
printed
in
heavy
type
somehow
it
looked
ominous
his
first
impression
was
to
bid
minnie
send
the
man
away
he
distrusted
any
first
impression
it
was
the
excuse
of
mediocrity
a
sign
of
weakness
moreover
why
he
meet
isidor
ingerman
him
in
he
said
almost
gruffly
thus
silencing
shy
intuition
as
it
were
he
threw
the
card
on
the
table
ingerman
entered
he
did
not
offer
any
conventional
greeting
but
nodded
or
bowed
grant
could
not
be
sure
which
form
of
salutation
was
intended
because
the
visitor
promptly
sat
down
uninvited
minnie
hesitated
at
the
door
her
callers
were
usually
cheerful
bohemians
who
chatted
at
sight
then
she
caught
eye
and
went
out
banging
the
door
in
sheer
nervousness
still
ingerman
did
not
speak
if
this
was
a
pose
on
his
part
he
erred
grant
had
passed
through
a
trying
day
but
he
owned
the
muscles
and
nerves
of
an
alpine
climber
and
had
often
stared
calmly
down
a
wall
of
rock
and
ice
which
he
had
just
conquered
when
the
least
slip
would
have
meant
being
dashed
to
pieces
two
thousand
feet
below
there
was
some
advantage
too
in
this
species
of
stage
wait
it
enabled
him
to
take
the
measure
of
adelaide
husband
if
indeed
the
visitor
was
really
the
man
he
professed
to
be
at
first
sight
isidor
ingerman
was
not
a
prepossessing
person
indeed
it
would
be
safe
to
assume
that
if
by
some
trick
of
fortune
he
and
not
grant
were
the
tenant
of
robinson
would
have
haled
him
to
the
village
that
very
morning
it
was
not
that
he
was
but
rather
that
he
looked
capable
of
villainy
he
was
a
tall
slender
rather
stooping
man
with
a
decidedly
if
face
his
aspect
might
be
described
as
saturnine
possibly
when
he
smiled
this
morose
expression
would
vanish
and
then
he
might
even
win
a
favorable
opinion
he
had
brilliant
black
eyes
close
set
and
an
abundant
crop
of
black
hair
turning
gray
which
in
itself
lent
an
air
of
distinction
his
lips
were
thin
his
chin
slightly
prominent
he
was
well
dressed
and
managed
a
hat
stick
and
gloves
with
ease
altogether
he
reminded
grant
of
a
certain
notable
actor
who
is
invariably
cast
for
the
rôle
of
a
gentlemanly
scoundrel
but
who
in
private
life
is
a
most
excellent
fellow
and
good
citizen
oddly
enough
grant
recognized
in
him
too
the
type
of
man
who
would
certainly
have
appealed
to
adelaide
melhuish
in
her
earlier
and
impressionable
years
meanwhile
the
visitor
finding
that
the
young
man
seated
in
an
easy
chair
from
which
he
had
not
risen
could
seemingly
regard
him
with
blank
indifference
during
the
next
hour
thought
fit
to
say
something
my
name
familiar
to
you
grant
he
inquired
the
voice
was
astonishingly
soft
and
pleasant
and
the
accent
agreeably
refined
evidently
there
were
surprising
points
about
ingerman
long
afterwards
grant
learned
by
chance
that
the
man
had
been
an
actor
before
branching
off
into
that
mysterious
cosmopolitan
profession
known
as
said
grant
have
heard
it
very
few
times
once
about
three
years
ago
and
today
when
i
mentioned
it
to
the
the
other
sallow
cheeks
grew
a
shade
more
sallow
grant
supposed
that
this
slight
change
of
color
indicated
annoyance
of
course
the
association
of
ideas
in
that
curt
answer
was
intolerably
rude
but
grant
had
been
tried
beyond
endurance
that
day
he
was
in
a
mood
to
be
brusque
with
an
archbishop
can
disregard
your
confidences
or
explanations
to
the
police
said
ingerman
smoothly
years
ago
i
suppose
my
wife
spoke
of
me
you
mean
miss
adelaide
do
mean
her
to
be
exact
i
mean
the
lady
who
was
murdered
outside
this
house
last
grant
realized
instantly
that
isidor
ingerman
was
a
foeman
worthy
of
even
a
skill
in
repartee
thus
far
he
grant
had
been
merely
uncivil
using
a
bludgeon
for
wit
whereas
the
visitor
was
making
play
with
a
rapier
that
you
have
established
your
identity
ingerman
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
why
you
are
here
he
said
have
come
to
steynholme
to
inquire
into
my
most
laudable
purpose
i
was
given
to
understand
however
that
at
one
time
you
took
little
interest
in
her
living
i
have
not
seen
ingerman
for
three
last
night
that
there
is
a
chance
of
course
that
husband
and
wife
may
have
adjusted
their
differences
is
that
so
last
night
repeated
ingerman
almost
in
a
startled
tone
admit
that
grant
turned
and
pointed
saw
or
fancied
i
saw
her
face
at
that
window
he
said
looked
in
on
me
about
ten
minutes
to
eleven
i
was
hard
at
work
but
the
vision
as
it
seemed
then
was
so
weird
and
unexpected
that
i
went
straight
out
and
searched
for
her
perhaps
is
not
quite
the
right
word
to
be
exact
i
opened
the
french
window
stood
there
and
listened
then
i
persuaded
myself
that
i
was
imagining
a
vain
thing
and
came
was
she
doing
here
arrived
in
steynholme
on
sunday
evening
i
am
heard
that
imply
that
you
did
not
meet
her
need
to
imply
anything
ingerman
i
did
not
meet
her
beyond
the
fanciful
notion
that
i
had
seen
her
ghost
last
night
the
first
i
knew
of
her
presence
in
the
village
was
when
i
recognized
her
dead
body
this
as
it
may
sound
i
am
inclined
to
believe
grant
said
nothing
he
wanted
to
get
up
and
pitch
ingerman
into
the
road
who
else
will
take
that
charitable
view
purred
the
other
in
that
suave
voice
which
so
ill
accorded
with
his
thin
lips
and
slightly
hooked
nose
really
care
was
the
weary
answer
at
the
moment
perhaps
you
have
had
a
trying
day
no
doubt
my
visit
at
its
close
can
not
be
helpful
am
feeling
rather
tired
mentally
interrupted
grant
you
will
oblige
me
by
not
raising
too
many
points
at
once
why
should
you
imagine
that
conversation
with
you
in
particular
should
add
to
my
supposed
distress
it
then
may
i
ask
do
you
so
obviously
resent
my
questions
who
has
so
much
right
to
put
them
as
i
grant
found
that
he
must
bestir
himself
thus
far
the
honors
lay
with
this
rather
yet
visitor
am
sorry
if
anything
i
have
said
lends
color
to
that
belief
he
answered
i
began
by
assuming
that
you
forfeited
any
legal
right
years
ago
to
interfere
in
behalf
of
miss
melhuish
living
or
dead
let
us
at
least
be
candid
with
each
other
miss
melhuish
herself
told
me
that
you
and
she
had
separated
by
mutual
me
to
emulate
your
candor
the
actual
fact
is
that
you
weaned
my
affections
from
is
a
downright
lie
said
grant
coolly
peculiar
temperament
permitted
him
to
treat
this
grave
insult
far
more
lightly
than
harmless
if
irritating
reference
to
the
police
us
see
just
what
signifies
he
said
almost
judicially
a
lady
deserts
her
husband
and
there
is
good
reason
to
suspect
that
she
is
in
popular
phrase
with
another
man
how
can
the
husband
be
lying
if
he
charges
that
man
with
being
the
cause
of
the
domestic
upheaval
this
instance
a
hypothetical
case
is
not
called
for
three
years
ago
ingerman
you
had
parted
from
your
wife
your
name
was
never
mentioned
apparently
none
in
my
circle
had
even
heard
of
you
miss
melhuish
had
won
repute
as
a
celebrated
actress
i
met
her
in
a
sense
professionally
we
became
friends
i
fancied
i
was
in
love
with
her
i
proposed
marriage
then
and
not
until
then
did
the
ghost
of
bent
forward
and
consulted
the
isidor
ingerman
marriage
was
out
of
the
question
you
expect
an
ingerman
rested
the
handle
of
his
stick
against
his
lips
how
the
situation
was
represented
to
me
at
the
time
he
said
thoughtfully
grant
was
still
sore
with
the
recollection
of
the
way
in
which
the
superintendent
of
police
had
forced
him
to
confess
the
pitiful
scheme
whereby
a
woman
in
love
had
sought
to
gain
her
ends
he
refused
to
sully
her
memory
a
second
time
that
day
even
to
gain
the
upper
hand
in
this
troublesome
controversy
neither
know
nor
care
what
representations
may
have
been
made
to
you
he
retorted
merely
tell
you
the
literal
possibly
it
was
not
i
who
used
the
word
remember
but
if
you
are
ungracious
enough
to
refuse
to
withdraw
the
offensive
phrase
let
it
pass
we
are
not
in
france
this
deadly
business
will
be
fought
out
in
the
law
courts
i
am
here
of
my
own
initiative
i
thought
it
only
fair
and
reasonable
that
you
and
i
should
meet
before
we
are
brought
face
to
face
at
a
inquest
and
it
may
be
in
an
assize
court
no
no
grant
pray
do
not
put
the
worst
construction
on
my
words
murdered
my
wife
if
the
police
show
intelligence
and
reasonable
skill
will
be
tried
for
the
crime
you
and
i
will
certainly
be
witnesses
that
is
what
i
meant
to
convey
the
doubt
in
my
mind
was
to
be
actively
hostile
or
passively
friendly
to
the
man
who
next
to
me
was
interested
in
the
poor
woman
now
lying
dead
in
a
wretched
stable
of
this
the
almost
diabolical
cleverness
of
this
long
speech
delivered
without
heat
and
with
singularly
adroit
stress
on
various
passages
was
revealed
by
its
effect
on
grant
he
was
at
once
infuriated
and
puzzled
ingerman
was
playing
him
as
a
fisherman
humors
a
salmon
the
simile
actually
occurred
to
him
and
he
resolved
to
precipitate
matters
by
coming
straightway
to
the
your
friendship
purchasable
he
inquired
making
the
rush
without
further
preamble
wife
was
i
was
led
to
believe
came
the
calm
retort
grant
threw
scruples
to
the
wind
now
adelaide
mulhuish
was
being
defamed
not
by
him
but
by
her
husband
are
at
cross
purposes
he
said
weighing
each
word
wife
who
knew
your
character
fairly
well
i
am
convinced
thought
that
you
were
open
to
receive
a
cash
consideration
for
your
connivance
in
a
had
told
me
plainly
that
she
would
never
live
with
me
again
i
was
too
a
man
to
place
obstacles
in
the
way
when
she
wished
to
regain
her
it
was
true
then
what
was
the
price
one
i
am
not
a
am
i
as
a
mere
matter
of
pounds
shillings
and
pence
it
was
a
serious
matter
for
me
when
my
earnings
ceased
to
come
into
the
common
first
if
rather
vague
estimate
of
you
was
the
correct
one
you
are
a
good
bit
of
a
scoundrel
and
if
i
guess
rightly
a
are
talking
at
random
grant
the
levying
of
blackmail
connotes
that
the
person
bled
desires
that
some
discreditable
or
dangerous
fact
should
be
is
not
my
can
relieve
you
of
any
oppressive
doubt
i
informed
the
police
some
few
hours
ago
that
you
have
appeared
already
in
a
similar
you
did
did
you
snarled
ingerman
suddenly
abandoning
his
pose
and
gazing
at
grant
with
a
curiously
snakelike
glint
in
his
black
eyes
it
interested
them
i
grant
was
sure
of
his
man
now
and
rather
relieved
that
the
battle
of
wits
was
turning
in
his
favor
you
have
begun
already
to
scheme
your
defense
you
better
go
was
the
contemptuous
retort
refuse
to
answer
any
further
questions
refuse
to
buy
your
proffered
that
may
i
offered
to
sell
it
gathered
as
ingerman
rose
he
was
still
master
of
himself
though
his
lanky
body
was
taut
with
rage
he
spoke
calmly
and
with
remarkable
restraint
through
what
i
have
said
and
discover
if
you
can
the
slightest
hint
of
any
suggested
condonation
of
your
offenses
whether
avowed
or
merely
suspected
i
shall
prove
beyond
dispute
that
you
came
between
me
and
my
wife
hug
the
delusion
that
your
three
limit
will
save
you
it
will
not
i
wish
you
well
of
your
attempt
to
prove
that
i
was
a
consenting
party
to
divorce
proceedings
i
came
here
to
look
you
over
i
have
done
so
and
have
arrived
at
a
very
definite
opinion
i
also
have
been
interviewed
by
the
police
and
any
unfavorable
views
they
may
have
formed
concerning
me
as
the
outcome
of
ex
statements
are
more
than
counteracted
by
the
ugly
facts
of
a
ghastly
murder
you
were
here
shortly
before
eleven
last
night
my
wife
was
here
too
and
alive
this
morning
she
was
found
dead
by
you
at
eleven
last
night
i
was
playing
bridge
with
three
city
men
in
my
flat
when
the
news
of
the
murder
reached
me
my
first
thought
after
the
shock
of
it
had
passed
was
fellow
grant
may
be
innocently
involved
in
a
terrible
crime
and
i
may
figure
as
the
chief
witness
against
i
am
not
speaking
idly
as
you
will
learn
to
your
cost
yet
when
i
come
on
an
errand
of
mercy
you
have
the
impudence
to
charge
me
with
blackmail
you
are
in
for
a
great
awakening
be
sure
of
that
and
isidor
ingerman
walked
out
leaving
grant
uncomfortably
aware
that
he
had
not
seen
the
last
of
an
implacable
and
bitter
enemy
it
was
something
new
and
very
disturbing
for
a
writer
to
find
himself
in
the
predicament
of
a
man
with
an
absolutely
clear
conscience
yet
perilously
near
the
meshes
of
the
criminal
law
he
had
often
analyzed
such
a
situation
in
his
books
but
fiction
diverged
so
radically
from
hard
fact
that
the
sensation
was
profoundly
disconcerting
to
say
the
least
he
did
not
go
to
the
post
office
he
was
not
equal
to
any
more
verbal
that
evening
so
he
lit
a
pipe
and
reviewed
periods
very
carefully
even
taking
the
precaution
to
jot
down
exact
phrases
he
analyzed
them
and
saw
that
they
were
capable
of
two
readings
of
course
it
could
not
be
otherwise
the
plausible
rascal
must
have
conned
them
over
until
this
essential
was
secured
grant
even
went
so
far
as
to
give
them
a
grudging
professional
tribute
they
held
a
canker
of
doubt
too
which
it
was
difficult
to
dissect
their
veiled
threats
were
perplexing
while
their
effect
as
apart
from
literal
significance
was
fresh
in
his
mind
he
made
a
few
notes
of
different
interpretations
he
went
to
bed
rather
early
but
could
not
sleep
until
the
small
hours
probably
his
rest
such
as
it
was
would
have
been
even
more
disturbed
had
he
been
able
to
accompany
ingerman
to
the
hare
and
hounds
inn
a
small
but
select
company
had
gathered
in
the
bar
parlor
the
two
hours
between
eight
and
ten
were
the
most
important
of
the
day
to
the
landlord
tomlin
it
was
then
that
he
imparted
and
received
the
of
local
gossip
garnered
earlier
the
process
involving
a
good
deal
of
play
with
shining
and
attractively
labeled
bottles
but
this
was
a
special
occasion
never
before
had
there
been
a
steynholme
murder
before
the
symposium
hitherto
such
a
grewsome
topic
was
supplied
for
the
most
part
by
faraway
london
the
eeriness
and
dramatic
intensity
of
a
notable
crime
lay
at
the
very
doors
of
the
village
so
tomlin
was
more
portentous
than
usual
hobbs
the
butcher
more
assertive
elkin
the
breeder
of
polo
ponies
more
inclined
to
on
any
conceivable
subject
and
siddle
the
chemist
a
reserved
man
at
the
best
even
less
disposed
to
voice
a
definite
opinion
elkin
was
about
years
of
age
siddle
looked
younger
than
his
probable
years
while
the
others
were
on
the
stout
and
prosperous
line
of
fifty
they
were
discussing
the
murder
of
course
when
ingerman
entered
and
ordered
a
whiskey
and
soda
instantly
there
was
dead
silence
looks
and
furtive
winks
were
exchanged
there
had
been
talk
of
a
detective
being
employed
perhaps
this
was
he
tomlin
knew
the
name
as
he
had
taken
a
room
but
that
was
the
extent
of
the
available
information
fine
sir
said
tomlin
drawing
a
cork
noisily
as
though
we
were
in
for
a
spell
settled
agreed
ingerman
summing
up
the
conclave
at
a
glance
such
a
lovely
night
ill
accords
with
the
cause
of
my
visit
to
sir
you
and
these
other
gentlemen
may
judge
for
yourselves
it
will
be
no
secret
tomorrow
i
am
the
husband
of
the
lady
who
was
found
in
the
river
outside
residence
this
sensation
as
the
descriptive
reporters
put
it
tomlin
was
dumbly
but
unanimously
elected
chairman
of
the
meeting
and
was
vaguely
aware
of
his
responsibilities
he
drew
himself
a
fresh
glass
of
bitter
tell
me
sir
he
gasped
the
idee
the
pore
letters
were
addressed
to
miss
adelaide
melhuish
perhaps
you
know
sir
that
she
stayed
here
yes
i
was
told
that
by
the
local
have
i
by
any
chance
been
given
her
room
sir
not
likely
locked
and
the
police
have
the
key
till
the
inquest
is
done
for
the
name
explained
ingerman
in
his
suave
voice
was
a
mere
stage
pseudonym
an
adopted
name
my
wife
was
a
famous
actress
and
there
is
a
sort
of
tacit
agreement
that
a
lady
in
the
theatrical
profession
shall
be
known
to
the
public
as
rather
than
there
wheezed
tomlin
ever
thought
it
the
landlord
was
not
quite
rising
to
the
occasion
he
was
in
fact
stunned
by
these
repeated
shocks
so
hobbs
took
charge
a
sad
errand
on
sir
he
said
comes
to
all
of
us
man
beast
alike
but
a
terrible
thing
when
a
lady
like
is
my
name
but
my
wife
will
certainly
be
alluded
to
by
the
press
as
miss
a
lady
like
miss
melhuish
is
knocked
on
the
like
hobbs
hesitated
again
he
also
felt
that
the
situation
was
rather
beyond
him
my
wife
was
flung
into
the
river
and
drowned
said
ingerman
sadly
sir
she
was
killed
fust
it
was
a
brutal
business
so
you
mean
that
she
was
struck
her
skull
battered
came
the
demand
in
an
awed
and
whisper
sir
the
wust
thing
is
none
of
us
can
guess
who
could
done
yer
five
quid
to
one
hobbs
that
the
police
cop
the
scoundrel
afore
this
day
fortnight
cried
elkin
noisily
then
siddle
put
in
a
mild
word
he
said
me
remind
you
that
we
four
will
probably
be
jurors
at
the
that
was
a
sobering
thought
elkin
subsided
and
hobbs
looked
critically
at
the
remains
of
a
gill
of
beer
ingerman
took
stock
of
the
chemist
he
might
easily
induce
the
others
to
believe
that
grant
was
the
real
criminal
but
the
quiet
man
in
the
black
and
striped
cloth
trousers
was
of
finer
metal
he
knew
instantly
that
if
he
could
persuade
this
one
of
guilt
the
remainder
would
follow
his
lead
like
a
flock
of
sheep
but
there
was
no
need
to
hurry
next
inquest
would
be
a
mere
formality
the
real
struggle
would
begin
a
week
or
a
fortnight
later
have
said
a
very
wise
thing
sir
he
murmured
appreciatively
my
feelings
must
be
kept
under
better
control
but
this
is
no
ordinary
murder
before
it
is
cleared
up
there
will
be
astounding
revelations
mark
the
hobbs
whose
heavy
cheeks
were
of
a
tint
almost
startled
the
conclave
by
a
sudden
outburst
which
gave
him
an
apoplectic
appearance
too
siddle
he
cried
the
use
of
rubbish
we
all
know
where
the
body
was
found
we
all
know
that
doris
martin
grant
were
in
the
here
hobbs
just
keep
doris
name
out
of
it
shouted
elkin
smiting
the
table
with
his
fist
till
the
glasses
danced
protested
siddle
gently
all
dashed
fine
but
blustered
elkin
he
yielded
to
outstretched
hand
seem
to
have
brought
discord
into
a
friendly
gathering
came
the
mournful
comment
was
far
from
being
my
intent
landlord
the
round
is
on
me
with
cigars
now
let
us
talk
of
anything
but
this
horror
if
i
forget
myself
again
pull
me
up
short
and
fine
me
another
siddle
half
rose
but
thought
better
of
it
evidently
he
meant
to
use
his
influence
to
stop
foolish
chatter
chapter
the
seeds
of
mischief
ingerman
was
a
shrewder
judge
of
human
nature
than
the
village
chemist
as
well
try
to
stem
the
flowing
tide
as
stop
tongues
from
wagging
when
such
a
theme
offered
tomlin
created
a
momentary
diversion
by
clattering
in
the
bar
after
this
professional
interlude
ingerman
ignored
his
own
compact
sure
you
local
residents
will
be
interested
at
least
in
hearing
something
of
my
career
he
said
never
was
a
more
lovable
and
gracious
woman
and
no
couple
could
be
more
united
than
she
and
i
till
some
three
years
ago
then
came
a
break
she
was
independent
of
me
of
course
she
was
a
celebrity
i
a
mere
nobody
best
known
if
at
all
as
nevertheless
we
were
devoted
to
each
other
until
to
her
and
my
lasting
misfortune
a
certain
author
wrote
a
book
which
when
dramatized
contained
a
part
for
which
my
stage
presence
and
talents
seemed
to
be
peculiarly
siddle
stirred
uneasily
but
the
others
were
still
as
partridges
in
stubble
ingerman
did
not
intend
to
alarm
the
shy
bird
of
the
covey
however
name
no
names
he
said
solemnly
am
i
telling
you
anything
that
will
not
be
thoroughly
exposed
before
the
coroner
and
elsewhere
from
that
unhappy
period
dated
our
estrangement
my
wife
fell
under
a
fatal
influence
which
lasted
practically
unchecked
until
the
day
if
not
the
very
hour
of
her
death
do
i
blame
her
thousand
times
no
you
see
me
a
plain
man
considerably
her
senior
had
not
the
gift
of
writing
impassioned
love
passages
in
which
she
could
display
her
artistic
genius
when
i
came
home
from
the
city
tired
after
the
work
was
just
beginning
hers
you
know
what
london
fashionable
life
theater
a
supper
a
dance
some
great
and
the
rest
of
it
ah
me
the
stage
and
literature
and
the
arts
generally
are
not
for
poor
fellows
moiling
in
a
city
office
you
gentlemen
i
take
it
are
all
happily
not
said
elkin
lay
you
long
odds
i
will
be
for
some
reason
this
remark
produced
a
certain
uneasiness
among
his
friends
tomlin
stared
at
the
ash
of
one
of
the
cigars
by
this
talkative
londoner
hobbs
whose
glass
had
reached
a
low
level
again
examined
the
dregs
almost
fiercely
and
siddle
seemed
to
be
about
to
say
something
but
with
his
usual
restraint
kept
silent
then
ingerman
made
a
very
shrewd
guess
and
wondered
who
doris
martin
was
and
what
cryptic
allusion
had
meant
luck
to
you
sir
he
said
no
marry
an
actress
an
old
adage
of
a
feather
flock
i
would
go
farther
and
interpolate
the
word
if
adelaide
melhuish
had
never
met
me
but
had
married
the
man
who
could
write
her
plays
this
tragedy
in
real
life
would
never
have
him
muttered
elkin
fiercely
done
for
now
anyhow
turn
no
more
heads
for
a
five
minutes
since
you
yapped
at
me
like
a
vicious
for
much
the
same
thing
chortled
hobbs
siddle
stood
up
siddle
went
on
the
butcher
past
have
some
accounts
to
get
out
near
the
half
year
you
know
and
siddle
vanished
unobtrusively
hobbs
shook
his
head
and
gazed
at
elkin
as
though
the
latter
was
a
refractory
bullock
a
chap
he
said
stand
any
of
us
a
man
without
a
fair
ingerman
had
marked
the
chemist
for
more
subtle
treatment
when
an
opportunity
arose
or
could
be
made
at
present
he
was
not
sorry
such
a
restraining
influence
was
removed
the
next
half
hour
should
prove
a
golden
one
if
well
utilized
he
was
right
before
the
inn
was
cleared
what
between
savage
comments
and
the
other
allusions
he
knew
all
that
steynholme
could
tell
with
regard
to
grant
and
doris
martin
first
thought
next
morning
was
of
the
girl
who
had
been
thrust
so
prominently
into
his
life
by
the
death
of
another
woman
that
was
perhaps
the
strangest
outcome
of
the
tragedy
doris
was
easily
the
prettiest
and
most
intelligent
girl
in
the
village
a
rare
combination
in
itself
even
among
young
ladies
of
much
higher
social
position
than
a
daughter
but
her
father
was
a
man
whose
life
had
been
given
to
books
whose
only
hobby
was
the
culture
and
study
of
bees
he
had
often
refused
promotion
solely
because
his
duties
at
steynholme
were
light
and
permitted
of
many
free
hours
in
his
only
child
he
found
a
quick
pupil
and
a
sympathetic
helper
of
her
own
accord
she
took
to
poetry
and
music
in
effect
had
doris
martin
attended
the
best
of
and
training
colleges
she
would
have
received
a
smattering
of
french
and
a
fair
knowledge
of
the
piano
or
violin
whereas
after
more
humble
tuition
it
might
fairly
be
said
of
her
that
few
girls
of
her
age
had
read
so
many
books
and
assimilated
their
contents
so
thoroughly
from
her
mother
she
inherited
her
good
looks
and
a
small
yearly
income
just
sufficient
to
maintain
a
better
wardrobe
than
her
salary
would
permit
grant
newly
settled
in
steynholme
found
the
postmaster
and
his
daughter
intellectually
on
a
par
with
himself
and
this
claim
could
certainly
not
be
made
on
behalf
of
the
local
element
the
three
became
excellent
friends
naturally
the
young
people
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
together
but
there
had
been
no
a
hint
or
whisper
of
it
and
now
by
cruel
chance
their
names
were
linked
by
scandal
in
its
most
menacing
form
since
there
was
no
gainsaying
the
fact
that
on
that
fatal
monday
night
was
indissolubly
bound
up
with
the
death
of
adelaide
melhuish
for
the
first
time
then
the
notion
peeped
up
in
mind
that
the
whirligig
of
existence
might
see
doris
his
wife
but
the
conceit
resembled
the
teeth
which
when
sown
in
the
ground
sprang
forth
as
armed
men
the
very
accident
which
revealed
a
not
unpleasing
possibility
had
established
a
grave
obstacle
in
the
way
of
its
ultimate
realization
already
there
was
a
cloud
between
him
and
the
martins
father
and
daughter
to
what
a
tempest
might
not
that
cloud
develop
when
the
questionings
and
innuendoes
of
the
inquest
established
an
aura
of
suspicion
and
intrigue
around
a
perfectly
innocent
meeting
in
the
garden
of
grant
ate
his
breakfast
in
wrath
in
wrath
too
he
glanced
through
the
morning
newspapers
and
saw
his
own
name
figuring
large
in
the
of
the
murder
the
reporters
had
missed
nothing
they
had
even
got
hold
of
the
of
his
glimpse
of
a
face
at
the
window
his
play
was
recalled
and
adelaide
success
in
the
then
isidor
ingerman
was
introduced
he
was
described
as
man
fairly
well
known
in
the
that
was
all
the
press
could
say
nothing
as
yet
of
marital
disagreements
nor
was
any
hint
concerning
doris
martin
allowed
to
appear
but
these
journalistic
were
only
held
in
reserve
and
sensational
were
promised
and
police
activity
in
unexpected
all
of
which
of
course
was
mere
journalistic
paraphrasing
of
circumstances
already
known
to
the
writers
and
none
the
less
galling
to
grant
on
that
account
and
there
was
no
answer
from
the
commissioner
of
police
at
scotland
yard
true
the
overnight
telegram
might
have
reached
the
department
after
office
hours
grant
like
most
members
of
the
general
public
held
the
vague
belief
that
government
officials
do
very
little
work
still
one
might
reasonably
expect
better
things
from
the
institution
which
was
supposed
to
safeguard
citizens
calm
analysis
of
nebulous
threats
had
revealed
a
hostile
force
not
to
be
despised
possibly
the
man
was
already
in
league
with
that
village
constable
so
every
passing
hour
made
more
urgent
the
need
of
a
trained
intelligence
being
brought
to
bear
on
the
mystery
of
adelaide
killing
grant
racked
his
brains
to
discover
who
could
possibly
have
a
motive
for
committing
the
crime
naturally
his
thoughts
flew
to
ingerman
surely
that
person
should
be
forced
to
give
an
account
of
himself
instead
of
as
was
probable
being
allowed
to
instill
further
nonsense
into
the
suspicious
mind
of
robinson
there
were
two
morning
deliveries
of
london
letters
in
steynholme
one
at
eight
and
another
at
half
past
ten
grant
waited
until
the
postman
had
left
a
circular
the
only
letter
for
by
the
second
mail
then
in
a
fever
of
impatience
he
jammed
on
a
hat
and
went
out
he
would
wait
no
longer
he
would
telegraph
scotland
yard
again
and
incidentally
demand
an
audience
at
the
post
office
no
sooner
had
he
entered
the
highroad
than
he
saw
robinson
on
guard
that
important
person
was
standing
on
the
bridge
apparently
taking
the
air
he
was
nibbling
the
of
his
helmet
both
thumbs
were
locked
in
his
belt
from
that
strategic
position
three
roads
came
under
observation
it
was
a
fine
morning
and
sense
of
humor
was
not
proof
against
this
open
espionage
he
smiled
and
determined
to
take
a
rise
out
of
as
bates
had
christened
the
policeman
the
bridge
lay
a
hundred
yards
to
the
left
the
road
was
straight
until
it
curved
around
the
house
and
its
shrubberies
so
the
view
was
blocked
on
that
side
grant
filled
and
lighted
a
pipe
with
a
deliberateness
meant
to
be
provoking
glancing
several
times
doubtfully
at
robinson
who
of
course
was
grandly
unaware
of
his
presence
then
he
strolled
off
to
the
right
and
when
hidden
took
to
his
heels
for
a
hundred
yards
sprint
turning
into
a
winding
tucked
between
hedges
of
thorn
and
hazels
he
walked
to
a
point
where
it
crossed
a
patch
of
furze
at
a
little
distance
a
spanned
the
river
and
gave
access
to
the
eastern
end
of
the
village
by
a
steep
climb
of
the
wooded
cliff
the
path
in
fact
was
a
short
cut
to
that
part
of
steynholme
he
sat
on
a
hump
of
rock
and
waited
it
was
a
boyish
trick
but
very
successful
within
three
minutes
at
the
utmost
robinson
hurried
past
using
a
stalking
stealthy
stride
which
was
distinctly
ludicrous
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
met
but
grant
alone
was
prepared
robinson
he
cried
cheerfully
the
rush
surely
our
rural
peace
has
not
been
disturbed
again
robinson
knew
he
had
been
but
rose
to
the
occasion
me
grant
he
puffed
wait
now
have
an
appointment
see
you
honor
demanded
that
he
should
not
relax
that
swift
pace
unhappily
the
path
up
the
cliff
was
visible
throughout
from
rock
so
on
reaching
the
summit
robinson
was
in
more
ways
than
one
moreover
peeping
through
the
first
screen
of
trees
that
offered
he
had
the
mortification
of
seeing
the
man
who
had
befooled
him
go
back
the
way
he
came
with
heat
and
anger
the
policeman
forgot
his
surroundings
and
glowered
at
grant
with
real
fury
so
he
heard
no
one
approaching
along
the
main
road
until
he
was
hailed
a
second
time
with
robinson
he
turned
sharply
this
was
elkin
morning
he
said
you
seen
the
superintendent
fowler
no
is
here
so
early
must
have
missed
hardly
find
him
on
bush
walk
which
was
the
name
of
the
path
never
can
tell
came
the
dark
answer
at
any
rate
the
policeman
elected
to
abandon
his
vigil
and
the
two
walked
together
into
the
village
you
look
as
though
run
a
mile
commented
elkin
murder
has
kept
me
busy
growled
the
other
frankly
mopping
his
forehead
so
and
it
done
with
yet
by
a
long
way
pity
you
in
the
hare
and
hounds
last
night
have
heard
something
a
chap
staying
there
name
of
met
him
the
dead
perhaps
got
his
yarn
already
all
depends
what
he
said
to
he
hinted
things
unless
greatly
mistaken
soon
be
making
an
believe
i
could
put
my
hand
on
the
murderer
this
very
minute
said
robinson
vindictively
elkin
laughed
somewhat
you
fifty
to
one
against
the
time
he
said
the
only
one
near
enough
for
that
limit
you
the
policeman
realized
that
he
had
allowed
annoyance
to
shake
his
wits
he
looked
at
elkin
rather
sharply
and
noticed
that
the
seemed
to
be
nervous
and
quite
mean
that
i
could
grab
my
man
this
minute
he
said
if
i
can
guess
him
it
amounts
to
nearly
the
same
thing
what
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
elkin
you
look
peeky
much
whiskey
and
tobacco
call
at
for
a
am
i
wanted
for
the
jury
i
left
a
notice
at
your
place
last
get
away
fact
is
i
went
home
late
and
bother
about
letters
this
morning
what
time
is
the
inquest
in
the
of
the
hare
and
that
fellow
grant
be
there
foxton
warned
him
what
about
doris
martin
will
she
be
a
witness
they
were
entering
the
village
and
could
see
down
the
long
wide
slope
of
the
hill
grant
had
just
come
into
sight
at
its
foot
both
men
scowled
at
the
distant
figure
but
neither
passed
any
comment
they
parted
the
policeman
walking
straight
on
elkin
bearing
to
the
left
the
shop
stood
exactly
opposite
the
post
office
so
elkin
arriving
first
was
aware
of
his
unconscious
destination
he
had
not
answered
greeting
but
gazed
moodily
through
a
barricade
of
specifics
piled
in
the
window
then
he
swore
wrong
now
inquired
the
chemist
quietly
grant
got
a
nerve
he
say
unless
you
just
gone
into
the
post
he
he
wants
stamps
may
be
plenty
of
i
should
a
fish
siddle
you
crazy
about
a
girl
like
i
am
the
sooner
in
jail
the
better
be
you
take
my
advice
which
you
i
know
you
will
not
utter
that
sort
of
remark
help
it
bet
you
a
fiver
engaged
to
doris
martin
within
a
siddle
took
thought
so
quickly
he
asked
after
a
pause
catch
her
on
the
hop
of
course
if
engaged
to
me
help
her
a
lot
when
this
case
comes
into
can
not
believe
that
doris
would
accept
any
man
for
such
a
not
she
knows
after
her
will
you
take
my
bet
even
money
i
you
put
a
damper
on
me
in
fact
you
have
you
that
last
prescription
of
handy
my
liver
wants
a
the
chemist
thumbed
a
volume
read
an
entry
carefully
and
retired
to
a
dispensing
counter
in
the
rear
of
the
shop
i
send
it
came
his
voice
wait
give
me
a
dose
now
if
you
for
some
reason
fred
elkin
was
not
himself
that
day
he
was
moody
and
fretful
as
a
sick
colt
but
he
had
diagnosed
his
ailment
and
its
cause
accurately
a
discreet
doctor
was
probably
aware
of
his
failings
and
had
considered
them
in
the
the
post
office
was
not
busy
when
grant
entered
a
young
man
a
stranger
was
seated
at
the
desk
tapping
a
new
instrument
the
forewarned
had
lent
an
expert
to
deal
with
press
messages
martin
sorting
some
documents
came
forward
when
he
saw
grant
his
kindly
somewhat
face
was
long
as
a
fiddle
morning
martin
said
grant
morning
what
can
i
do
for
you
was
the
stiff
reply
grant
was
in
no
mind
to
be
rebuffed
however
must
have
a
word
with
you
in
private
he
said
my
time
is
quite
sorry
too
but
the
matter
is
the
click
of
the
sounder
became
less
businesslike
there
was
an
element
in
the
tone
of
each
voice
that
drew
the
london
attention
martin
usually
the
man
in
sussex
was
obviously
ill
at
ease
but
he
simply
could
not
hold
out
against
compelling
gaze
into
the
back
room
he
said
nervously
me
if
needed
he
added
nodding
to
his
assistant
grant
did
not
hesitate
an
instant
when
the
postmaster
reached
the
through
another
door
the
open
window
draped
in
clematis
gave
a
delightful
glimpse
of
a
of
mignonette
filled
the
air
with
its
delicate
perfume
grant
hoped
that
doris
would
be
there
but
the
only
signs
of
her
recent
presence
were
a
hat
and
an
open
book
on
the
table
martin
he
said
gravely
and
i
should
have
a
serious
talk
it
is
idle
to
deny
that
gossip
is
spreading
broadcast
certain
malicious
and
absurd
rumors
which
closely
concern
doris
and
myself
to
me
these
things
are
of
slight
consequence
to
a
girl
of
your
age
they
are
poisonous
if
you
her
father
know
the
whole
truth
you
can
regulate
your
actions
so
as
to
defeat
the
scandalmongers
that
is
why
i
am
here
that
is
why
i
came
here
yesterday
but
your
attitude
took
me
aback
and
i
was
idiot
enough
to
go
without
a
word
of
explanation
i
was
too
shaken
then
to
see
my
clear
course
and
follow
it
regardless
of
personal
feelings
this
morning
i
am
master
of
myself
and
i
insist
that
you
listen
now
while
i
tell
you
exactly
what
occurred
on
monday
the
authorities
stammered
the
older
man
your
good
name
martin
reddened
his
agitation
was
pitiful
is
hardly
in
question
sir
he
said
brokenly
am
speaking
of
the
tongue
of
slander
heaven
help
and
direct
me
i
would
suffer
death
rather
than
see
doris
subjected
to
the
leers
and
innuendoes
of
every
lout
in
the
earnestness
could
hardly
fail
to
impress
his
friend
but
martin
had
either
made
up
his
mind
or
been
warned
not
to
discuss
the
murder
and
adhered
loyally
to
that
line
of
conduct
he
retreated
toward
the
door
leading
to
the
post
office
proper
is
too
late
to
interfere
now
he
said
on
earth
do
you
mean
demanded
grant
yielding
to
a
gust
of
anger
the
being
inquired
into
by
the
police
came
the
hesitating
answer
that
prying
scoundrel
robinson
dared
to
doris
came
here
of
course
but
scotland
yard
has
taken
up
the
he
is
with
doris
in
the
garden
at
this
grant
knew
the
topography
of
the
house
without
asking
permission
he
tore
through
yet
a
third
door
leading
to
a
kitchen
and
scullery
nearly
upsetting
a
tiny
maid
who
had
her
ear
or
eye
to
the
and
raced
into
the
garden
in
which
the
postmaster
kept
his
bees
doris
standing
with
her
hands
behind
her
back
was
looking
at
the
hollies
and
deep
in
conversation
with
an
alert
and
natty
little
man
who
was
evidently
absorbed
in
what
she
was
saying
grant
in
a
whirl
of
fury
was
only
conscious
that
companion
was
slight
almost
diminutive
of
frame
very
erect
and
dressed
in
a
blue
serge
suit
neat
brown
boots
and
straw
hat
when
the
two
heard
his
footsteps
doris
was
flustered
her
romney
face
held
a
look
of
scare
here
is
grant
she
said
striving
vainly
to
speak
with
composure
the
little
man
pierced
grant
with
an
extraordinarily
penetrating
glance
from
very
bright
and
black
eyes
grant
is
it
he
chirped
pleasantly
morning
so
the
villain
of
the
piece
are
you
chapter
vi
scotland
yard
takes
a
hand
it
was
a
singular
greeting
to
say
the
least
and
the
person
who
uttered
it
was
quite
as
remarkable
as
his
queer
method
of
expressing
himself
seemed
to
indicate
grant
though
in
a
fume
of
hot
anger
had
the
good
sense
to
choke
back
the
first
impetuous
reprimand
trembling
on
his
lips
in
fact
wrath
quickly
subsided
into
blank
incredulity
he
saw
before
him
not
the
conventional
detective
who
might
be
described
as
a
superior
even
the
sinewy
and
type
of
man
whom
he
had
once
heard
giving
evidence
in
a
famous
rather
one
whom
he
would
have
expected
to
meet
in
the
bar
of
a
certain
restaurant
in
maiden
lane
a
corner
of
old
london
where
literally
all
the
a
stage
and
all
the
men
and
women
merely
players
during
his
theatrical
experiences
he
had
come
across
scores
of
such
men
dapper
little
fellows
wizened
of
face
yet
curiously
youthful
in
manner
but
they
each
and
all
were
labeled
certainly
a
rare
intelligence
gleamed
from
this
eyes
but
that
is
an
attribute
not
often
lacking
in
humorists
who
command
high
salaries
because
of
their
facility
in
this
man
too
had
the
wide
mobile
mouth
of
the
actor
his
wrinkled
forehead
and
cheeks
the
bluish
tint
on
jaws
and
chin
his
voice
his
perky
air
the
very
tilt
of
his
straw
hat
were
eloquent
of
the
footlights
even
his
opening
words
bizarre
and
cheerfully
impertinent
smacked
of
figure
prominently
in
this
particular
snapped
grant
i
ask
your
name
sir
wise
precaution
with
suspicious
characters
rejoined
the
other
smiling
grant
was
suddenly
reminded
of
a
japanese
grinning
at
a
joke
but
he
bent
over
a
card
which
the
stranger
had
whisked
out
of
a
waistcoat
pocket
he
read
charles
furneaux
investigation
new
scotland
yard
he
could
not
control
himself
he
gazed
at
charles
furneaux
with
a
surprise
that
was
not
altogether
flattering
the
commissioner
of
police
send
in
response
to
my
telegram
he
said
is
what
lawyers
call
a
leading
question
came
the
prompt
retort
i
hate
lawyers
they
darken
understanding
and
set
honest
men
at
it
happens
to
be
very
much
to
the
point
at
this
grant
if
you
really
press
for
an
answer
it
is
and
the
commissioner
received
a
certain
telegram
but
he
may
have
acted
on
other
grounds
even
commissioners
can
be
creatures
of
impulse
or
expediency
just
as
the
situation
demands
are
here
at
any
is
what
legal
jargon
terms
an
admitted
you
had
better
begin
by
assuming
that
i
am
no
is
assumed
it
well
be
otherwise
after
the
excellent
character
you
have
been
given
by
this
young
at
least
will
speak
well
of
me
i
do
believe
said
grant
with
a
strange
bitterness
for
his
heart
was
sore
because
of
the
seeming
defection
of
his
friend
the
postmaster
i
actually
had
in
mind
was
the
stupidity
of
the
local
policeman
who
is
convinced
that
i
am
both
a
criminal
and
a
two
are
often
synonymous
said
furneaux
dryly
i
acquitted
you
on
both
counts
grant
on
hearing
and
even
seeing
how
you
spent
monday
grant
who
had
cooled
down
considerably
found
a
hint
of
badinage
in
this
comment
have
evidently
been
told
that
miss
martin
and
i
were
in
the
garden
of
my
house
he
said
happens
to
be
yes
there
was
a
very
fine
cluster
of
small
stars
in
canis
major
south
of
sirius
that
know
something
about
the
constellations
then
was
the
astonished
query
for
the
purposes
of
scotland
yard
smirked
furneaux
who
had
checked
story
by
referring
to
almanack
may
relieve
your
mind
if
i
tell
you
that
i
have
never
seen
a
real
live
astronomer
in
the
dock
venus
and
mars
are
often
in
trouble
but
their
devoted
observers
seldom
if
grant
warmed
to
this
strange
species
of
detective
though
if
pressed
for
an
instant
decision
he
would
vastly
have
preferred
that
one
of
more
orthodox
style
had
been
intrusted
with
an
inquiry
so
vital
to
his
own
happiness
and
good
repute
eager
however
to
pour
forth
his
worries
into
any
official
ear
he
brought
back
the
talk
to
a
definite
channel
you
come
to
my
place
he
asked
have
much
to
say
let
me
assure
you
now
in
miss
presence
that
she
is
no
more
concerned
in
this
ghastly
business
than
any
other
young
lady
in
the
she
is
interested
and
are
and
i
am
why
not
discuss
matters
here
for
the
present
i
mean
we
have
a
glorious
view
of
your
house
and
grounds
we
can
see
without
being
seen
none
can
overhear
i
advise
both
of
you
to
go
thoroughly
into
this
matter
here
and
furneaux
spoke
emphatically
even
doris
put
in
a
timid
plea
that
would
be
the
best
thing
to
do
she
said
furneaux
has
been
most
sympathetic
i
am
sure
he
understands
things
already
in
a
way
that
is
quite
wonderful
to
the
very
sound
of
her
voice
was
comforting
grant
might
have
argued
with
the
detective
but
could
not
resist
doris
without
further
demur
he
went
through
the
whole
story
giving
precise
details
of
events
on
the
monday
night
then
the
recital
widened
out
into
a
history
of
his
relations
with
adelaide
melhuish
he
omitted
nothing
doris
gasped
when
she
heard
superintendent
version
of
the
view
a
jury
might
take
of
her
presence
in
the
garden
of
at
a
late
hour
but
grant
did
not
spare
her
he
reasoned
that
she
ought
to
be
prepared
for
an
ordeal
which
could
not
be
avoided
he
was
governed
by
the
astute
belief
that
his
very
outspokenness
in
this
respect
would
weaken
the
inferences
which
the
police
might
otherwise
draw
from
it
furneaux
uttered
never
a
word
he
was
a
listener
though
his
behavior
was
most
since
he
hardly
looked
at
grant
or
the
girl
but
seemed
to
devote
his
attention
almost
exclusively
to
the
scenic
panorama
in
front
however
when
grant
came
to
the
somewhat
strenuous
of
the
previous
night
between
ingerman
and
himself
the
little
man
broke
in
at
once
ingerman
he
cried
he
a
tall
lanky
cadaverous
rather
crooked
person
with
black
hair
turning
gray
and
an
absurdly
melodious
voice
have
described
him
without
an
unnecessary
word
said
grant
furneaux
clicked
his
tongue
in
a
peculiar
fashion
on
he
said
a
regular
in
your
line
grant
of
course
but
none
the
less
enthralling
because
as
you
so
happily
phrased
miss
lesson
in
astronomy
it
happens
to
be
grant
was
scrupulously
fair
to
ingerman
he
admitted
the
adroitness
of
speech
and
made
clear
the
fact
that
if
the
visit
had
the
levying
of
blackmail
for
its
object
such
a
possible
outcome
was
only
hinted
at
vaguely
being
a
novelist
one
whose
temperament
sought
for
sunshine
rather
than
gloom
in
life
he
wound
up
in
lighter
vein
the
ruse
which
tricked
robinson
into
a
breathless
scamper
of
nearly
a
mile
on
a
hot
day
in
june
was
described
with
gusto
doris
who
knew
the
village
constable
well
laughed
outright
while
furneaux
cackled
shrilly
none
who
might
be
watching
the
little
group
in
that
delightful
garden
with
its
scent
of
flowers
and
drone
of
bees
could
have
guessed
that
a
grewsome
tragedy
formed
their
major
theme
the
girl
was
the
first
to
realize
that
even
harmless
merriment
was
in
ill
accord
with
the
presence
of
death
for
the
body
of
adelaide
melhuish
lay
within
forty
yards
of
the
place
where
they
stood
i
leave
you
now
she
inquired
may
be
wanting
help
in
the
detain
you
more
than
a
few
seconds
said
furneaux
briskly
monday
evening
you
two
young
people
parted
at
half
past
ten
how
do
you
fix
the
time
doris
answered
without
hesitation
large
window
of
study
was
open
and
we
both
heard
a
clock
in
the
hall
chime
the
i
said
me
is
that
half
past
ten
and
started
for
home
at
once
grant
came
with
me
as
far
as
the
bridge
when
i
reached
my
room
in
exactly
five
minutes
after
leaving
i
stood
at
the
open
she
pointed
to
a
dormer
casement
above
the
looked
out
it
was
a
particularly
fine
night
mild
but
not
very
clear
as
a
slight
mist
often
rises
from
the
river
after
a
hot
day
in
summer
i
may
have
been
there
about
ten
minutes
no
longer
when
i
saw
the
study
window
of
thrown
open
and
figure
was
silhouetted
by
the
lamp
behind
him
he
seemed
to
be
listening
for
something
so
i
who
must
have
heard
any
unusual
sound
listened
too
there
was
nothing
i
could
hear
the
ripple
of
the
river
beneath
the
bridge
so
everything
was
very
still
after
a
minute
or
two
grant
went
in
and
closed
the
window
then
i
went
to
grant
draw
any
blind
or
curtains
are
muslin
curtains
attached
to
each
side
of
the
window
one
can
not
see
into
the
room
from
a
furneaux
measured
an
imaginary
line
drawn
from
bedroom
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
prolonged
it
can
you
see
the
river
or
foot
of
the
lawn
from
your
room
he
commented
in
winter
i
can
just
make
out
the
edge
of
the
lawn
when
the
trees
are
in
leaf
all
the
lower
part
is
had
actually
retired
to
rest
about
eleven
i
suppose
if
grant
came
out
again
you
would
not
know
doris
blushed
furiously
but
her
reply
was
unfaltering
would
have
known
during
the
next
at
least
she
said
inclined
mirror
hangs
in
my
room
i
use
it
sometimes
for
adjusting
a
hat
the
square
of
light
from
room
is
reflected
in
it
and
any
sudden
increase
in
the
illumination
caused
by
opening
the
window
or
pulling
the
curtains
aside
would
certainly
have
caught
my
have
an
unshakable
witness
in
miss
martin
said
furneaux
stabbing
a
finger
at
grant
hurry
off
you
and
i
grant
meet
at
philippi
otherwise
known
as
the
any
benevolent
intent
he
may
have
had
in
leaving
these
young
people
together
was
however
frustrated
by
doris
whose
composure
seemed
to
have
fled
since
her
statement
about
the
mirror
she
resolutely
accompanied
the
detective
and
grant
had
to
follow
all
three
passed
into
the
post
office
doris
using
the
private
door
martin
looked
up
from
his
desk
when
they
appeared
and
requested
his
daughter
to
check
a
bundle
of
postal
orders
the
pretext
was
painfully
obvious
but
grant
was
not
so
wishful
now
to
clear
up
matters
with
father
as
the
girl
herself
might
be
trusted
to
pass
on
an
accurate
account
of
the
affair
from
beginning
to
end
he
was
about
to
reach
the
street
quick
on
heels
when
the
little
man
turned
suddenly
the
way
you
want
a
worth
of
stamps
he
said
grant
smiled
comprehension
and
went
back
to
the
counter
where
doris
herself
served
him
she
did
not
try
to
avoid
his
glance
but
rather
met
it
with
a
baffling
serenity
oddly
at
variance
with
her
momentary
loss
of
in
the
garden
when
he
entered
the
street
the
detective
had
vanished
he
walked
down
the
hill
at
a
rapid
pace
disregarding
the
eyes
peeping
at
him
through
open
doorways
over
narrow
and
covertly
staring
when
people
passed
in
the
roadway
the
sensitive
side
of
his
temperament
shrank
from
this
hostility
he
was
by
way
of
being
popular
in
steynholme
yet
not
a
soul
spoke
to
him
before
he
reached
the
bridge
the
other
side
of
him
the
man
of
action
of
cool
resource
in
an
emergency
rose
in
rebellion
against
the
league
of
silly
clodhoppers
back
he
strode
to
the
post
office
and
dashed
off
a
telegram
it
ran
hart
savage
club
adelphi
london
come
here
and
help
to
lay
a
he
signed
it
in
full
name
and
address
doris
was
gone
but
her
father
received
it
and
read
the
text
in
a
bewildered
way
find
myself
deserted
by
my
steynholme
friends
so
i
am
trying
to
import
one
stanch
one
said
grant
almost
vindictively
martin
murmured
the
cost
and
grant
stormed
out
again
this
time
passing
the
hare
and
hounds
he
looked
at
door
and
windows
he
caught
a
face
scowling
at
him
over
a
brown
wire
blind
bearing
the
words
and
on
it
in
letters
of
dull
gold
it
was
a
commonplace
type
of
face
and
crowned
by
a
hat
set
at
a
rakish
angle
its
most
marked
characteristic
was
the
positive
hatred
which
glowed
in
the
sharp
eyes
grant
wondered
who
this
highly
censorious
young
man
might
be
at
any
rate
he
meant
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
the
critic
was
susceptible
of
satire
at
his
own
expense
he
walked
up
to
the
window
elevated
his
eyebrows
at
the
frowning
person
within
pretended
to
read
the
words
on
the
screen
looked
again
at
the
man
inside
and
shook
his
head
gravely
in
the
manner
of
one
who
has
accurately
determined
cause
and
effect
fred
elkin
was
enough
to
appreciate
unspoken
comment
he
was
also
unmannerly
enough
to
put
out
his
tongue
then
grant
laughed
and
turned
on
his
heel
siddle
quietly
observant
of
recent
comings
and
goings
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
shop
and
missed
no
item
of
this
dumb
show
he
raised
both
hands
in
silent
condemnation
of
childishness
whereupon
the
jerked
a
thumb
toward
retreating
figure
and
went
through
a
rapid
pantomime
of
the
hanging
process
his
crony
disapproved
again
and
went
in
now
both
those
men
were
on
the
jury
panel
so
to
all
appearance
grant
would
be
judged
by
at
least
one
deadly
enemy
whose
animosity
might
or
might
not
be
fairly
balanced
by
the
impartial
mind
the
tenant
of
actually
dreaded
the
loneliness
of
his
dwelling
now
though
it
was
that
very
quality
which
had
drawn
him
to
steynholme
a
year
earlier
work
or
reading
was
equally
out
of
the
question
that
day
he
sought
the
industrious
bates
who
was
trenching
celery
in
the
kitchen
garden
made
out
owt
about
un
sir
inquired
that
hardy
individual
pausing
to
spit
on
the
handle
of
his
spade
said
grant
thing
is
a
greater
mystery
than
her
mun
bin
killed
by
a
loony
announced
bates
of
the
kind
no
doubt
but
why
are
the
little
less
dangerous
loonies
of
steynholme
united
in
the
belief
that
i
am
the
guilty
one
me
another
growled
bates
is
spreading
this
rumor
robinson
sir
looks
fierce
but
tongue
will
see
to

talking
that
is
quite
a
chap
in
the
last
sir
the

a
song
of

elkin

about

a
mile
and
bates
pointed
to
the
west
grant
hazarded
a
guess
and
described
the
face
of
condemnation
seen
at
the
inn
bates
nodded
un
he
said
then
he
drove
the
spade
into
the
rich
loam
do
say
he
added
apparently
as
an
fred
elkin
is
mighty
sweet
on
doris
but
nowt
to
do
grant
whistled
softly
this
explanation
threw
light
on
a
dark
place
plot
thickens
he
said
elkin
becomes
more
interesting
than
he
looks
are
there
other
disappointed
swains
in
the
offing
that
sir
miss
martin
any
other
suitors
of
be
after
her
like
wasps
round
a
if
give
a
chance
but
put
a
stopper
on
bates
was
blunt
of
speech
though
a
philosopher
withal
is
my
only
serious
rival
then
laughed
grant
passing
off
as
a
joke
a
thrust
which
was
shrewder
than
the
gardener
knew
plenty
of
brass
but
i
reckon
nowt
on
was
the
contemptuous
answer
he
is
not
a
likely
person
to
kill
a
woman
he
had
never
before
seen
miss
martin
will
marry
whom
she
chooses
no
doubt
the
present
problem
is
to
find
out
who
murdered
miss
melhuish
now
had
been
the
victim
you
would
be
thinking
hard
tell
sir
it
wur
a
nor
was
bates
to
be
moved
from
that
opinion
he
held
to
it
through
thick
and
thin
for
many
days
grant
wandered
into
the
front
garden
his
eyes
rose
involuntarily
to
the
distant
post
office
and
he
noticed
at
once
that
the
dormer
window
was
closed
yet
doris
shared
his
own
love
of
fresh
air
and
that
window
had
always
been
open
till
that
very
hour
somehow
this
simple
thing
seemed
to
shut
him
out
of
her
life
he
walked
to
the
river
and
gazed
at
the
spot
where
the
body
was
drawn
ashore
in
the
absence
of
rain
the
water
ran
clear
as
gin
and
the
marks
made
by
the
feet
of
adelaide
murderer
were
still
perceptible
if
only
those
misshapen
blotches
could
reveal
their
secret
if
only
some
ray
of
intuition
would
enable
him
to
put
the
police
on
the
track
of
the
criminal
theoretically
a
novelist
and
essayist
should
be
a
detective
yet
brought
face
to
face
with
an
actual
felony
here
was
one
who
perforce
remained
blind
and
dumb
yet
he
was
not
blameworthy
for
failing
to
solve
a
mystery
which
was
rapidly
establishing
a
record
for
bewildering
elements
wherein
he
did
err
most
lamentably
was
in
his
reading
of
a
heart
no
answering
telegram
came
from
his
friend
in
london
the
day
wore
slowly
till
it
was
time
to
attend
the
inquest
he
found
a
crowd
gathered
in
front
of
the
hare
and
hounds
superintendent
fowler
was
there
and
quite
a
number
of
policemen
whose
presence
was
explained
when
a
buzz
of
excitement
heralded
arrival
he
decided
not
to
stand
this
sort
of
persecution
a
moment
longer
before
the
superintendent
could
interfere
he
leaped
on
to
a
set
of
stone
which
stood
opposite
the
door
instantly
seeing
that
he
was
about
to
speak
the
angry
murmuring
of
the
mob
was
hushed
he
looked
into
a
hundred
stolid
faces
and
stretched
out
his
right
hand
can
not
help
feeling
he
said
in
slow
incisive
accents
which
carried
far
a
set
of
peculiar
circumstances
has
led
you
steynholme
folk
to
suspect
me
of
being
responsible
in
some
way
for
the
death
of
the
lady
whose
body
was
found
in
the
river
near
my
house
now
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
am
not
only
an
innocent
but
a
man
the
law
of
the
land
will
establish
both
facts
in
due
season
but
i
want
to
warn
some
of
you
too
i
shall
not
trouble
to
issue
writs
for
libel
if
any
blackguard
among
you
dares
to
insult
me
openly
i
shall
smash
his
he
knew
when
to
stop
superintendent
nudge
was
not
called
for
as
the
orator
simply
met
the
scrutiny
of
all
those
eyes
without
another
word
curiously
enough
the
sense
of
justice
is
inherent
in
every
haphazard
gathering
of
the
public
soldierly
bearing
his
calm
defiance
of
hostile
opinion
the
outspoken
threat
which
he
so
plainly
meant
won
instant
favor
someone
shouted
hear
and
the
crowd
applauded
from
that
moment
he
had
little
to
complain
of
in
the
attitude
of
the
community
as
a
whole
there
were
subtle
and
dangerous
enemies
to
be
fought
and
conquered
but
steynholme
looked
on
keen
to
learn
of
any
new
sensation
of
course
but
placidly
content
that
the
final
verdict
should
be
left
in
the
hands
of
the
authorities
chapter
vii
and
the
inquest
was
surprisingly
tame
after
the
stirring
events
which
had
led
up
to
it
indeed
save
for
two
incidents
the
proceedings
were
almost
dull
the
coroner
a
knoleworth
solicitor
named
belcher
prided
himself
on
conducting
this
with
as
little
ostentation
as
he
would
have
displayed
over
an
ordinary
inquiry
siddle
elkin
tomlin
and
hobbs
with
eight
other
local
tradesmen
and
farmers
formed
the
jurors
and
the
chemist
was
promptly
elected
foreman
no
witnesses
were
ordered
out
of
court
the
formalities
of
the
jury
and
the
body
were
carried
through
rapidly
almost
before
grant
had
time
to
assimilate
these
details
superintendent
fowler
who
marshalled
the
evidence
called
his
name
the
officer
tendered
him
a
bible
while
the
coroner
himself
administered
the
oath
grant
eyed
the
somewhat
soiled
volume
and
opened
it
before
putting
it
to
his
lips
the
action
probably
did
not
please
the
jury
elkin
nudged
tomlin
and
sniggered
at
the
rest
of
his
colleagues
as
much
as
to
say
did
i
tell
you
the
cheek
of
him
elkin
by
the
way
looked
ill
when
his
interest
flagged
for
an
instant
his
haggard
aspect
became
more
noticeable
ingerman
was
there
of
course
furneaux
sat
beside
fowler
a
stranger
whom
grant
did
not
recognize
proved
to
be
the
county
chief
constable
there
was
a
strong
muster
of
police
and
the
representatives
of
the
press
completely
monopolized
the
scanty
accommodation
for
the
public
to
relief
doris
martin
was
not
in
attendance
he
told
the
simple
facts
of
the
finding
of
adelaide
corpse
a
harmless
question
by
the
coroner
evoked
the
first
which
set
the
pencils
busy
you
recognize
the
body
inquired
belcher
you
can
give
the
jury
her
name
before
grant
could
answer
ingerman
sprang
up
his
sallow
face
livid
with
passion
protest
sir
against
this
man
being
permitted
to
identify
my
wife
he
said
he
was
either
deeply
moved
or
proved
himself
an
excellent
actor
his
voice
vibrated
with
an
intense
emotion
thus
might
mark
antony
have
spoken
when
vowing
that
brutus
was
an
honorable
man
are
you
demanded
the
coroner
sharply
george
ingerman
husband
of
the
deceased
lady
came
the
reply
sit
down
sir
and
do
not
interrupt
the
court
again
said
the
coroner
demand
sir
that
you
note
my
down
were
you
any
other
person
i
would
have
you
removed
as
it
is
i
am
prepared
to
regard
your
feelings
to
the
extent
of
explaining
that
the
witness
is
not
identifying
the
body
but
relating
a
fact
within
his
own
ingerman
bowed
and
resumed
his
seat
for
some
reason
grant
stared
blankly
at
furneaux
the
latter
did
not
meet
his
glance
but
put
a
finger
on
those
thin
lips
it
might
or
might
not
be
a
warning
to
repress
any
retort
he
had
in
mind
at
any
rate
obeying
a
nod
from
the
coroner
he
merely
said
was
a
actress
miss
adelaide
pen
hesitated
a
little
then
it
scratched
on
undoubtedly
he
was
himself
exercising
the
restraint
he
meant
to
impose
on
others
are
quite
sure
he
said
after
a
pause
you
grant
wait
here
until
you
sign
your
deposition
of
course
you
are
aware
that
this
inquiry
will
stand
adjourned
and
the
whole
matter
will
be
gone
into
fully
at
a
later
i
have
been
informed
ingerman
was
the
next
witness
like
a
good
democrat
kissed
the
cover
of
the
bible
the
coroner
began
by
giving
him
some
advice
is
a
purely
formal
inquiry
to
permit
of
a
death
certificate
being
issued
you
will
oblige
me
therefore
by
answering
my
questions
without
introducing
any
extraneous
ingerman
adhered
to
these
instructions
having
already
shot
a
bolt
he
meant
avoiding
any
further
conflict
with
the
authorities
his
evidence
was
brief
and
to
the
point
the
deceased
was
his
wife
they
were
married
at
a
london
office
on
a
given
date
six
years
ago
his
wife
acted
under
her
maiden
name
there
was
no
family
the
court
was
well
lighted
by
four
long
windows
in
the
eastern
wall
which
each
witness
faced
so
grant
was
free
to
study
his
avowed
enemy
at
leisure
he
thought
he
made
out
a
crafty
underlook
in
ingerman
which
he
had
failed
to
detect
the
previous
night
that
slow
smooth
voice
seemed
to
weigh
each
syllable
such
a
man
would
never
blurt
out
an
unconsidered
admission
he
was
a
foe
to
be
reckoned
with
the
subtle
malignancy
of
that
outburst
was
proof
positive
in
that
respect
the
jury
apparently
attached
much
weight
to
his
words
on
some
faces
there
was
an
expectancy
which
merged
into
marked
disappointment
when
his
evidence
came
to
an
end
the
foreman
alone
displayed
the
judicial
attitude
warranted
by
the
oath
he
had
taken
somehow
grant
had
faith
in
siddle
the
man
looked
intellectual
when
spoken
to
in
his
shop
his
manner
was
invariably
reserved
but
that
was
his
general
repute
in
quiet
uninterfering
person
who
had
come
to
the
village
a
young
man
yet
had
never
really
entered
into
its
life
for
instance
he
neither
held
nor
would
accept
any
public
office
at
first
people
wondered
how
he
contrived
to
eke
out
a
living
but
this
puzzle
was
solved
by
his
admitted
possession
of
a
small
annuity
foxton
general
practitioner
who
held
undisputed
sway
in
the
district
told
how
he
had
conducted
an
autopsy
on
the
body
of
the
deceased
he
found
a
deep
incised
wound
on
the
back
of
the
skull
a
wound
which
would
have
caused
death
in
any
event
the
instrument
used
must
have
been
a
heavy
and
blunt
one
miss
melhuish
was
dead
or
dying
when
thrown
into
the
river
the
body
was
well
nourished
and
the
vital
organs
sound
undoubtedly
she
had
been
murdered
bates
followed
and
evoked
a
snigger
by
the
outspokenness
of
blunt
sussex
hauled
in
he
said
knew
it
wur
a
dead
by
the
feel
of
the
the
coroner
was
not
curious
he
merely
wished
to
put
on
record
the
time
and
manner
in
which
grant
summoned
assistance
then
robinson
entered
the
box
and
contrived
to
bring
about
the
second
he
told
how
information
received
he
went
to
and
found
grant
standing
near
the
river
with
a
dead
body
at
his
feet
side
of
face
was
covered
with
blood
he
went
on
if
the
policeman
was
minded
to
create
a
sensation
he
certainly
succeeded
a
slight
hum
ran
through
the
court
and
then
all
present
seemed
to
restrain
their
breathing
lest
a
word
of
the
evidence
should
be
lost
the
mention
of
in
a
murder
case
was
a
more
adroit
dodge
than
robinson
himself
guessed
perhaps
few
of
his
hearers
troubled
to
reflect
that
a
smudge
of
fresh
gore
on
cheek
could
hardly
have
any
bearing
on
the
death
of
a
woman
whose
body
had
admittedly
lain
all
night
in
the
river
it
sufficed
that
robinson
had
introduced
a
touch
of
the
right
color
into
the
inquiry
even
the
coroner
was
worried
he
said
testily
took
down
his
statement
sir
said
the
witness
well
knowing
that
he
had
wiped
off
morning
score
in
the
matter
of
bush
walk
mind
his
statement
that
must
await
the
adjourned
hearing
what
did
you
do
with
the
body
it
to
the
stable
of
the
hare
and
hounds
it
was
viewed
recently
by
the
jury
is
the
body
identified
by
ingerman
as
that
of
his
wife
will
do
superintendent
fowler
will
this
day
week
at
ten
suit
you
sir
said
the
superintendent
the
inquest
stands
adjourned
until
that
day
and
hour
gentlemen
of
the
jury
you
must
be
here
we
ask
any
questions
cried
elkin
in
an
injured
tone
you
can
not
snapped
the
coroner
emphatically
after
a
few
formalities
which
included
the
reading
and
signing
of
the
depositions
the
courthouse
emptied
the
whole
thing
was
over
in
half
an
hour
grant
determined
to
have
a
word
with
the
representative
of
scotland
yard
went
openly
to
furneaux
and
asked
him
to
come
to
the
hollies
and
join
him
in
a
cup
of
tea
was
the
curt
answer
busy
see
you
it
was
difficult
to
reconcile
the
present
manner
with
his
earlier
camaradie
to
say
nothing
of
the
seemingly
friendly
hint
conveyed
by
the
signal
to
pass
no
comment
on
interruption
rather
sick
at
heart
grant
went
out
into
the
sunshine
he
was
a
dozen
times
by
press
photographers
one
man
backing
impudently
in
front
of
him
in
order
to
secure
a
sharp
focus
tripped
over
the
raised
edge
of
a
cartway
into
a
yard
and
sat
down
violently
the
onlookers
laughed
but
grant
helped
the
photographer
to
rise
you
want
a
really
good
picture
of
the
steynholme
murderer
come
to
my
place
and
give
you
one
he
said
the
pressman
was
grateful
because
action
had
tended
to
mitigate
his
discomfiture
one
but
a
fool
thinks
of
you
as
a
murderer
grant
he
said
i
really
want
is
a
portrait
of
author
in
whose
grounds
the
body
was
along
then
and
pose
for
the
photographer
was
surprised
but
joyfully
accepted
the
gifts
the
gods
gave
he
could
not
guess
that
his
host
was
pining
for
human
companionship
he
could
not
fathom
disappointment
on
reaching
at
finding
no
telegram
from
a
trusted
friend
walter
hart
and
he
was
equally
unconscious
of
the
immense
service
he
rendered
by
compelling
his
host
to
talk
and
act
naturally
he
enlightened
grant
too
in
the
matter
of
inquests
week
there
will
be
a
gathering
of
lawyers
he
said
police
will
be
represented
probably
by
the
treasury
if
the
case
is
thought
sufficiently
important
that
chap
ingerman
too
will
employ
a
solicitor
i
expect
judging
from
his
attitude
in
fact
any
one
whose
interests
are
affected
ought
to
secure
legal
assistance
one
never
knows
how
these
inquiries
twist
and
you
said
grant
smiling
at
the
tact
order
tea
to
be
got
ready
while
taking
your
pictures
by
the
way
what
sort
of
detective
is
charles
furneaux
pocket
marvel
was
the
enthusiastic
answer
you
heard
of
him
before
well
you
unless
you
followed
famous
cases
professionally
he
seldom
appears
in
the
manages
to
wriggle
out
of
giving
direct
evidence
but
never
known
him
to
fail
he
either
hangs
his
man
or
drives
him
to
suicide
if
i
committed
a
crime
and
was
told
that
furneaux
was
after
me
own
up
and
save
trouble
because
i
have
the
ghost
of
a
chance
of
winning
strikes
one
as
too
flippant
for
a
lots
of
people
have
thought
that
and
either
disappearing
in
quicklime
beneath
some
corridor
of
a
prison
or
doing
time
at
portland
i
wonder
if
winter
also
is
coming
down
on
this
is
chief
inspector
at
the
a
big
his
appearance
might
be
a
and
with
a
taste
for
horses
and
greyhounds
he
and
furneaux
are
called
the
big
and
the
little
and
each
is
most
unlike
the
average
detective
but
heaven
help
any
they
set
out
to
trail
get
him
as
sure
as
god
made
little
the
sooner
winter
visits
steynholme
the
better
i
shall
be
pleased
this
tragedy
is
becoming
a
perfect
nightmare
you
heard
that
policeman
speak
of
my
face
being
covered
with
blood
he
did
it
purposely
i
made
a
fool
of
him
this
morning
so
he
paid
me
out
the
literal
truth
being
that
a
branch
of
that
dorothy
perkins
rose
there
caught
my
cheek
as
i
entered
this
room
on
tuesday
i
discovered
the
broke
the
skin
i
suppose
the
cut
is
visible
still
i
saw
it
while
said
the
other
chortling
over
the
his
colleagues
were
missing
mark
is
there
right
enough
queer
how
inanimate
objects
like
a
can
make
mischief
i
remember
a
case
in
which
a
chestnut
in
a
pocket
sent
him
to
penal
servitude
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
against
him
except
a
possible
motive
until
that
chestnut
was
found
and
proved
to
be
one
of
a
particular
species
grown
only
in
a
certain
fortunate
that
the
dorothy
perkins
is
popular
laughed
grant
your
paper
publish
photographs
of
the
principals
in
this
affair
expect
so
a
fine
jury
all
in
a
you
making
that
speech
to
the
will
that
appear
jove
yes
sir
it
was
wired
off
before
the
inquest
grant
reddened
slightly
his
own
impetuous
action
had
blurted
out
to
the
whole
world
that
which
steynholme
was
only
thinking
no
wonder
furneaux
had
warned
him
to
go
slow
perhaps
the
little
man
was
annoyed
because
of
his
challenge
to
the
village
crowd
well
be
it
so
he
meant
and
would
live
up
to
every
word
of
it
the
afternoon
dragged
after
the
departure
what
grant
really
hungered
for
was
a
talk
between
doris
martin
and
himself
but
short
of
a
foolish
attempt
to
carry
the
post
office
by
storm
he
saw
no
means
of
realizing
his
desire
he
must
perforce
await
the
less
troubled
hours
of
the
morrow
or
next
day
doris
would
surely
give
her
father
an
exact
account
of
the
conversation
between
grant
furneaux
and
herself
that
morning
and
that
greatly
perplexed
man
could
hardly
fail
to
see
how
unjust
was
the
of
the
village
so
avoiding
bates
whose
fell
intent
it
was
to
ask
him
what
he
wanted
for
dinner
he
struck
off
along
the
road
to
knoleworth
walked
eight
miles
in
two
hours
and
reached
about
seven
rather
inclined
for
a
meal
and
much
more
contented
with
life
minnie
announced
that
a
gentleman
brought
a
had
been
awaiting
him
since
five
and
was
now
asleep
on
the
lawn
a
glance
at
the
aforesaid
bag
still
reposing
in
the
entrance
hall
sent
grant
quickly
into
the
garden
a
long
person
was
stretched
on
a
wicker
chair
and
evidently
enjoying
a
nap
a
huge
meerschaum
pipe
and
tobacco
pouch
lay
on
the
grass
the
face
was
covered
by
a
decidedly
slouch
hat
which
legend
had
it
was
purchased
originally
in
south
america
in
the
early
nineties
and
had
won
fame
as
the
only
one
of
its
kind
ever
worn
in
the
strand
wally
glad
to
see
you
shouted
grant
joyously
the
sleeper
stirred
not
another
drop
he
muttered
fellows
must
have
heads
of
triple
brass
and
stomachs
of
leather
up
you
rascal
or
spill
you
out
of
the
chair
said
grant
a
lazy
hand
removed
the
hat
and
a
pair
of
peculiarly
big
and
bright
eyes
gazed
up
into
his
you

it
drawled
a
quiet
voice

blazes
did
you
send
for

having
sent

they
shook

hart
was
the
most
casual
adventurer
in
existence

specialty
was

flag
of

thither
went

gentlemen
told

ingerman
is
the
crafty
one
i
thought

harm

a
thick
ear

door
and
mutter
hawkshaw

he
resembles

i
asked
him
why
he
fly
in
through
an
attic
window
he
took
my
point
at
once
and
remarked
that
he
wanted
none
of
my
lip
or
he
would
ask
me
officially
what

darkest
corner

gleamed
at

amused

how
did
you

to

when
the
blinds
were
drawn
a
lamp
lighted

dispensed

one
he
sniffed

broke

and
crumbled
some
of

and
thumb
those
greeks
he
said
sadly
simply
go
straight
this
brand
of
turk
used
to
be
made
of
a
tobacco
grown
on
a
slope
above

up
a
reputation
which
is
now
being
bartered
for
filthy
lucre

connoisseur
these
said
hart
proffering
a

from

the

drew

the

aside
he
inquired

over

open
she
was
leaning
on
the
sill
but
he
could
not
tell
whether

not

eyes
were
turned
his
way
her
attitude
was
pensive
disconsolate

forlorn
for
a

was
on
the
point

diabolically

induced
wariness
the
dinner
was
a
marvel
considering
the
short
notice
given
to
the
cook
luckily
bates
a
loyal
soul
had
resolved
to
tempt
her
appetite
that
evening
village
gossip
had
it
that
the
police
were
about
to
arrest
him
and
she
was
determined
he
should
enjoy
at
least
one
good
meal
before
being
haled
to
prison
hence
the
materials
were
present
the
rest
was
a
matter
of
quantities
and
sussex
seldom
stints
itself
in
that
respect
the
chatter
round
the
table
was
light
and
amusing
the
three
were
well
matched
conversationally
furneaux
evidently
held
the
opinion
once
expressed
by
a
notable
the
time
had
come
talk
of
many
things
of
of
he
was
in
excellent
form
and
the
others
played
up
to
him
slow
drawl
was
ever
trenchant
and
witty
and
grant
forgot
his
woes
in
congenial
company
as
for
the
mercurial
detective
himself
it
might
be
said
of
him
as
of
the
of
auburn
still
they
gazed
and
still
the
wonder
grew
that
one
small
head
could
carry
all
he
it
was
he
who
dropped
them
with
a
bounce
from
the
realm
of
fancy
to
the
unpleasing
region
of
ugly
fact
no
sooner
had
minnie
cleared
the
table
and
brought
in
the
coffee
than
he
whisked
around
on
grant
as
though
hitherto
he
had
been
only
awaiting
an
opportunity
of
scarifying
him
he
said
propping
an
elbow
on
the
table
and
supporting
his
chin
on
a
clenched
fist

kill
adelaide
melhuish
grant
who
did
wish
i
could
tell
you
was
the
emphatic
answer
you
suspect
anybody
you
fear
the
libel
law
in
confiding
your
secret
thought
to
me
and
i
assume
that
hart
is
his
friends
are
concerned
that
unkind
differentiating
clause
my
pocket
vidocq
put
in
hart
two
kings
and
a
dozen
of
presidents
have
at
various
times
sent
most
unflattering
reports
to
this
country
about
must
have
annoyed
most
had
i
congratulate
you
but
heaven
only
knows
where
i
may
convoy
you
some
day
on
an
extradition
warrant
assure
you
on
my
honor
that
the
only
reasonable
suggestion
i
can
make
is
that
put
forward
by
my
gardener
said
grant
thinks
that
the
murder
must
have
been
committed
by
a
lunatic
i
can
offer
no
other
gardener
may
be
right
but
what
lunatic
barring
yourself
and
the
elkin
is
in
love
with
doris
martin
like
elkin
the
previous
night
grant
struck
the
table
till
things
rattled
her
name
out
of
it
he
cried
fiercely
are
a
man
of
the
world
not
a
suspicious
idiot
of
the
robinson
type
you
heard
the
full
and
true
explanation
of
her
presence
here
on
monday
night
it
was
a
sheer
accident
why
harp
on
doris
martin
rather
than
any
member
of
the
bates
family
may
i
ask
is
doris
martin
put
in
hart
steynholme
daughter
said
furneaux
remarkably
pretty
and
intelligent
girl
if
her
father
was
a
peer
she
would
be
the
belle
of
a
london
season
as
it
is
her
good
looks
seem
to
have
put
a
maggot
in
more
than
one
nut
in
this
hart
waved
the
head
in
the
air
lunatic
theory
for
mine
he
declared
one
lovely
face
could
bring
a
thousand
ships
to
ilion
why
should
not
drive
men
to
madness
in
steynholme
phrased
sir
cackled
furneaux
delightedly
wangle
that
in
on
a
respected
colleague
of
mine
who
is
a
whale
at
deducing
a
proposition
from
given
premises
but
can
not
induce
a
general
fact
from
particular
instances
to
save
his
life
now
stifle
your
romantic
frenzy
grant
and
listen
to
me
if
you
were
minded
to
instruct
me
in
the
art
of
writing
good
english
i
would
sit
at
your
feet
an
attentive
disciple
when
i
furneaux
of
the
lay
down
a
first
principle
in
the
investigation
of
crime
i
expect
deference
on
your
part
i
tell
you
unhesitatingly
that
if
doris
martin
exist
adelaide
melhuish
would
be
alive
now
that
as
a
thesis
is
nearly
as
certain
a
thing
as
that
the
sun
will
rise
i
go
farther
and
hazard
the
guess
not
the
fixed
belief
though
my
guesses
are
usually
borne
out
by
events
that
if
doris
martin
had
not
been
in
this
garden
at
half
past
ten
on
monday
night
adelaide
melhuish
would
not
have
been
killed
some
twenty
minutes
later
it
is
useless
for
you
to
fume
and
rage
in
vain
effort
to
disprove
either
of
these
presumptive
facts
you
are
simply
beating
the
air
this
mystery
centers
in
and
around
the
daughter
come
now
you
are
a
reasonable
person
admit
the
cold
hard
truth
and
then
give
play
to
your
said
hart
brandishing
his
pipe
again
suggest
that
you
and
i
here
and
now
form
a
mutual
admiration
is
a
cruel
and
bitter
thing
that
an
innocent
girl
should
be
dragged
into
association
with
a
foul
crime
said
grant
stubbornly
am
not
disputing
the
force
of
your
acumen
furneaux
my
only
desire
is
to
shield
the
good
name
of
a
very
charming
young
done
be
undone
countered
the
detective
well
knowing
that
grant
confessed
himself
beaten
what
is
all
the
bother
about
you
heard
from
miss
own
lips
absolutely
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
put
her
in
the
and
what
more
can
she
tell
you
am
not
worrying
about
her
appearance
in
the
said
furneaux
dryly
before
that
stage
is
reached
i
shall
be
hunting
a
star
burglar
or
perhaps
looking
into
the
foreign
office
of
our
worthy
friend
here
as
papers
hint
at
trouble
in
venezuela
no
sir
the
county
police
will
get
all
the
credit
robinson
will
be
swanking
about
then
telling
the
yokels
what
did
i
with
olympic
nod
say
your
man
and
the
brigade
do
the
rest
so
far
as
i
can
foresee
miss
name
may
be
spared
any
undue
prominence
in
this
inquiry
i
go
even
farther
and
promise
that
anything
i
can
do
in
that
way
shall
be
is
very
kind
and
considerate
of
you
said

gratefully
halloo

out
of

sitting
back
suddenly
and
nursing
his
left
knee
with
clasped
hands
control
other
actions
you
know
what
i
insist
on
is
that
you
shall
envisage
this
affair
in
its
proper
light
we
have
a
long
way
to
travel
before
counsel
rises
with
his
smug
it
please
you
me
lud
and
gentlemen
of
the

having
persuaded
you
to
agree
that
willy
nilly
miss
doris
is
the
hub
of
our
little
universe
for
the
hour
i
now
swear
you
and
this
in
as
assistants
there
must
be
no
more
speeches
no
punching
of
heads
very
little
and
that

the

delectable
sister

liliputian
cop
demanded

two
of
would
have
caused
a
riot
long
since
grant
will
do
all
and
more
than
all
necessary
in
that
grant
leaned
forward
he
spoke
very
earnestly
want
you
to
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
he
said
i
never
gave
serious
thought
to
the
notion
of
marrying
miss
martin
until
such
a
possibility
was
suggested
last
night
by
that
swab
ingerman
you
kept
a
record
of
what
he
said
i
gather
here
it
grant
rose
and
went
to
a
with
nests
of
drawers
which
stood
against
the
wall
on
the
left
of
the
door
he
never
used
it
for
its
primary
purpose
when
the
table
was
laid
for
meals
minnie
or
her
mother
had
orders
to
remove
all
papers
and
books
to
the
top
of
the
desk
the
house
contained
no
other
of
size
the
hall
was
spacious
a
smoking
den
next
the
had
degenerated
into
a
receptacle
of
guns
alpenstocks
skis
and
other
such
sporting
accessories
the
remainder
of
the
accommodation
was
given
up
to
the
bateses
unlocking
a
drawer
grant
produced
a
notebook
which
he
handed
to
furneaux
the
detective
laid
it
on
the
table
he
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
large
window
hart
faced
him
chair
was
between
the
two
the
way
as
on
your
feet
grant
said
furneaux
might
just
show
me
exactly
where
you
were
standing
when
you
saw
the
face
at
the
the
love
of
mike
this
gurgled
hart
face
at
the
how
many
more
catchy
will
you
bring
into
the
story
adelaide
melhuish
undoubtedly
came
here
on
monday
night
and
looked
in
at
me
while
i
was
at
work
said
grant
sadly
know
the
history
of
my
calf
love
three
years
ago
i
ever
forget
it
you
bored
me
stiff
about
it
then
when
the
crash
came
you
walked
me
off
my
legs
in
the
upper
engadine
ugh
that
night
on
the
forno
glacier
it
gives
me
a
chill
to
think
of
it
now
furneaux
pass
the
port
your
name
is
wrongly
spelt
it
should
be
not
furneaux
a
little
oven
hot
stuff
got
me
hart
you
flatter
me
retorted
the
detective
instantly
long
am
i
to
pose
here
snapped
grant
said
furneaux
interruptions
are
banal
is
that
where
you
were
i
had
my
hand
outstretched
for
a
book
dark
in
this
corner
when
i
want
to
find
a
book
i
light
a
candle
which
is
always
placed
on
the
ledge
of
the
window
for
the
purpose
the
blind
was
not
drawn
that
night
it
seldom
is
i
had
the
book
in
my
hand
and
had
found
the
required
passage
when
i
chanced
to
look
at
the
window
and
saw
you
mind
reconstructing
the
scene
this
lamp
was
on
the
table
i
suppose
pull
up
the
blind
light
your
candle
and
find
the
book
act
the
whole
incident
in
grant
obeyed
he
held
the
candlestick
until
he
had
picked
out
the
particular
volume
then
he
placed
it
in
the
recess
of
the
window
and
searched
through
the
pages
of
the
book
furneaux
bent
forward
so
as
to
watch
the
rehearsal
and
catch
the
effect
of
the
light
externally
the
hour
was
not
so
late
as
when
adelaide
melhuish
or
her
ghost
gazed
in
through
one
of
those
narrow
panes
but
the
night
was
dark
enough
to
lend
the
necessary
hart
deeply
interested
looked
on
with
rapt
eager
eyes
for
a
full
minute
the
tableau
remained
thus
then
with
a
rapidity
born
of
many
a
close
in
wild
lands
hart
drew
a
revolver
from
a
hip
pocket
and
fired
at
the
window
he
alone
was
in
a
position
to
see
through
all
parts
of
it
grant
was
still
thumbing
a
small
brown
volume
in
the
manner
of
one
who
knew
that
a
certain
passage
would
be
found
therein
but
was
ignorant
of
its
exact
place
in
the
text
furneaux
intent
on
his
every
movement
had
only
a
view
of
the
window
which
it
will
be
remembered
formed
a
tiny
rectangle
in
a
thick
wall
the
revolver
was
a
weapon
and
the
explosion
blew
out
the
lamp
the
flame
of
the
candle
flickered
owing
either
to
the
passage
of
the
bullet
or
the
disturbance
of
the
air
but
it
burnt
steadily
again
within
the
fifth
part
of
a
second
and
they
all
saw
a
starred
hole
in
the
center
pane
of
glass
of
the
second
tier
from
the
bottom
game
are
you
playing
shrilled
furneaux
nevertheless
active
as
a
wildcat
in
his
spring
to
the
french
window
there
to
snatch
at
the
blind
and
turn
the
knob
which
controlled
a
lever
bolt
another
with
whiskers
said
hart
coolly
got
him
too
i
must
be
mad
mad
shrieked
the
detective
tearing
open
the
window
and
vanishing
sake
wally
no
more
shooting
cried
grant
running
after
furneaux
minnie
and
her
mother
appeared
at
the
door
finding
the
place
in
and
reeking
with
gunpowder
they
screamed
loudly
steynholme
folk
are
all
on
the
jump
said
hart
up
fair
dames
thunder
relieves
the
atmosphere
you
know
and
one
live
cartridge
is
often
more
effective
than
an
ocean
of
shot
sir
gasped
minnie
ghost
a
most
scoundrelly
apparition
with
fearsome
eyes
offensive
whiskers
and
a
hat
which
is
a
base
copy
of
ben
sighed
bates
collapsing
straightway
in
a
faint
luckily
minnie
caught
her
mother
and
broke
her
fall
because
the
housekeeper
was
large
and
solid
and
might
have
been
seriously
injured
otherwise
hart
was
distressed
by
this
development
but
being
eminently
a
ready
person
in
an
emergency
he
rose
to
the
occasion
by
extracting
the
empty
case
from
the
revolver
and
holding
it
to
the
poor
nostrils
while
supporting
her
with
an
arm
and
a
knee
is
far
more
effective
than
burnt
brown
paper
minnie
he
said
get
excited
but
mix
some
brandy
and
water
and
have
your
mother
telling
us
who
owd

or
was

by
the
noises

father
shrieked
minnie
hysterically
lord
has
your
for
an
instant
hart
was
nearly
alarmed
but
voice
came
authoritatively
all
right
bates
let
go
i
tell
you
said
hart
was
on
the
point
of
confusing
your
respected
dad
with
owd
ben
it
ma
sniff
hard
as
a
cook
worth
your
weight

which
is

meanwhile
furneaux
seeing
that
no
dead
body
was
stretched
on
the
strip
of
grass
beneath
the
window
dashed
into
the
shrubbery
to
the
right
and
was
clutched
in
a
mighty
embrace
by
an
older
but
much
more
powerful
man
in
bates
who
had
hurried
from
the
front
of
the
house
on
hearing
the
most
fortunately
the
gardener
deeming
his
vigil
a
needless
one
had
not
armed
himself
with
a
stick
or
the
consequences
might
have
been
grave
as
it
was
no
one
except
hart
had
been
vouchsafed
sight
or
sound
of
the
latest
specter
which
however
had
left
a
very
convincing
souvenir
of
its
visit
in
the
shape
of
a
soft
felt
hat
with
two
bullet
holes
through
the
crown
furneaux
quivering
with
silent
wrath
soon
abandoned
the
search
when
this
de
was
found
at
the
root
of
the
dorothy
perkins
seeing
the
lamp
relighted
he
peremptorily
bade
grant
and
bates
come
in
with
him
he
closed
the
window
adjusted
the
blind
again
and
poured
generous
measures
of
port
wine
into
two
glasses
handing
one
to
bates
he
took
the
other
himself
he
said
men
have
fame
thrust
upon
them
but
you
have
achieved
it
you
pierced
the
heel
of
achilles
to
you
dunno
wot
saying
mister
but
said
bates
swigging
the
wine
with
gusto
for
your
sake
not
a
word
to
a
soul
about
this
you
are
sir
but
that
there
robinson
wur
on
bridge
five
minutes
since
and
by
gum
here
he
is
a
determined
knock
and
ring
came
at
the
front
door
minnie
helped
by
hart
had
just
escorted
bates
to
the
kitchen
go
said
furneaux
darting
out
into
the
hall
he
opened
the
door
and
thrust
his
face
into
the
startling
the
latter
considerably
before
robinson
could
utter
a
syllable
the
detective
hissed
a
question
anyone
cross
the
bridge
after
that
shot
was
fired
sir
stuttered
the
other
saw
no
one
running
along
the
road
nothing
well
glad
to
find
on
the
job
let
on
you
met
me
here
mighty
is
scotland
yard
with
the
provincial
police
robinson
was
back
on
his
beat
before
he
well
realized
that
he
knew
neither
why
nor
by
whom
nor
by
what
sort
of
weapon
the
commotion
had
been
created
but
he
was
quite
sure
the
noise
came
from
the
garden
front
of
house
little
thinks
smart
dam
smart
he
communed
angrily
taken
a
line
of
me
own
stick
to
it
though
the
yard
sends
down
twenty
men
he
heard
footsteps
coming
down
a
paved
footpath
which
ran
like
a
white
riband
through
the
width
of
the
and
withdrew
swiftly
to
the
shelter
of
a
disused
tannery
adjoining
the
village
end
of
the
bridge
a
cloaked
female
figure
sped
past
though
the
night
was
rather
dark
for
june
he
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
doris
graceful
movements
no
other
girl
in
steynholme
walked
like
her
she
was
slim
enough
to
dispense
with
tight
corsets
and
tall
enough
to
wear
shoes
nor
did
she
need
to
pinch
her
toes
in
order
to
gain
the
semblance
of
small
feet
after
her
went
robinson
keyed
to
exultation
by
this
outcome
of
his
watchfulness
she
was
going
to
of
course
the
road
led
to
knoleworth
and
no
young
woman
of
her
age
in
the
village
would
dream
of
taking
a
lonely
walk
in
the
country
at
ten
at
night
for
a
man
of
his
height
and
somewhat
ponderous
build
the
policeman
followed
with
real
stealth
thus
when
she
turned
in
at
the
gate
he
was
there
by
the
time
she
had
reached
the
front
door
he
heard
her
pull
the
bell
curiously
enough
to
his
thinking
furneaux
again
appeared
grant
at
home
he
heard
doris
say
will
you
come
in
replied
the
detective
all
well
here
i
assure
you
but
come
in
escort
you
home
going
to
the
inn
in
five
doris
after
hesitating
a
little
entered
robinson
crept
on
tiptoe
over
a
stretch
of
gravel
and
took
to
the
shrubbery
it
was
high
time
he
thought
that
the
local
constabulary
learnt
what
was
going
on
in
that
abode
of
mystery
chapter
ix
how
whom
the
cap
several
minutes
had
elapsed
between
the
two
unexpected
visits
during
those
minutes
a
somewhat
acrimonious
discussion
broke
out
in
the
bates
went
to
reassure
his
wife
and
hart
sauntered
back
from
the
kitchen
he
was
received
by
furneaux
and
grant
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
a
pose
on
their
part
which
he
blandly
disregarded
he
helped
himself
to
the
remains
of
the
decanter
of
port
next
point
of
vital
interest
in
the
narrative
is
to
establish
by
such
evidence
as
is
available
who
owd
ben
is
or
was
he
said
presume
since
he
had
attained
local
celebrity
as
a
ghost
he
has
passed
over
as
the
spiritists
down
cried
furneaux
savagely
hart
sat
down
and
began
filling
that
portentous
pipe
fellows
merely
ran
into
each
other
outside
i
take
it
he
said
apparently
by
way
of
a
chatty
remark
crack
of
the
and
the
supposed
resurrection
of
owd
ben
threw
bates
temporarily
off
her
balance
so
i
helped
in
reviving
her
between
such
a
cook
and
such
a
ghost
who
would
hesitate
when
furneaux
was
really
irritated
he
swore
in
french
bon
petit
homme
gris
he
almost
squealed
did
you
whip
out
that
infernal
revolver
you
spoiled
everything
everything
have
you
no
sense
in
that
picturesque
head
of
yours
your
skull
is
big
enough
to
hold
brains
not
your
french
father
marry
a
jap
inquired
hart
with
sudden
interest
now
insulting
my
mother
yelped
the
detective
i
you
know
nothing
about
the
finest
race
of
little
women
in
the
world
or
you
would
not
even
imagine
such
why
why
you
tell
me
that
you
saw
someone
outside
have
believed
me
the
goblin
was
disappearing
i
had
to
shoot
shoot
at
all
there
are
certain
manifestations
i
object
to
on
principle
what
ghost
ever
wore
whiskers
was
no
ghost
you
shot
the
hat
what
the
blazes
are
you
growling
at
had
i
in
whisper
told
you
that
once
again
there
was
a
face
at
the
window
you
would
have
scoffed
at
me
the
scamp
caught
my
eye
after
his
first
glance
at
grant
he
was
mizzling
when
i
fired
you
would
have
sat
there
and
argued
about
hypnosis
with
our
worthy
skilled
support
and
there
would
have
been
no
hat
i
do
an
admirable
bit
of
trick
shooting
yet
i
am
only
reviled
for
my
dexterity
really
charles
françois
you
remember
at
last
and
the
detective
smiled
sourly
as
they
say
in
paris
where
you
and
i
met
once
though
in
a
crowd
but
steal
the
blessed
pearl
i
believe
it
was
that
blatant
patriot
domengo
got
brains
then
why
not
use
them
you
see
what
a
fix
we
three
would
have
found
ourselves
in
had
you
shot
the
man
consider
carlo
mio
a
spook
with
whiskers
what
court
would
find
me
guilty
let
me
produce
the
authentic
record
of
owd
ben
and
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
the
lord
chief
justice
himself
would
have
potted
his
representative
be
bound
to
confess
furneaux
was
cooling
down
shaken
my
confidence
he
said
i
have
your
promise
that
you
will
never
do
such
a
thing
again
while
in
my
company
i
shall
ban
you
from
this
inquiry
with
bell
book
and
well
a
bargain
now
let
us
ponder
exhibit
he
stretched
a
long
arm
over
the
table
and
took
the
hat
it
on
commanded
the
detective
hart
did
so
and
scowled
frightfully
furneaux
bent
forward
and
squinted
the
line
of
those
he
said
to
grant
man
wearing
that
hat
must
have
had
his
scalp
ploughed
up
said
grant
instantly
we
know
that
nothing
of
the
kind
happened
why
was
perched
on
top
of
a
wig
drawled
hart
furneaux
was
slightly
was
no
denying
it
being
a
vain
little
person
he
liked
to
show
off
in
a
minor
matter
such
as
this
he
admitted
the
corollary
the
wearer
is
probably
a
person
with
thin
hair
a
daring
scoundrel
who
is
well
posted
in
the
leading
characteristics
of
owd
ben
charles
le
petit
time
is
now
ripe
for
details
of
that
hairy
did
you
dig
him
up
from
anyhow
said
the
detective
testily
bates
recognized
him
from
my
vivid
husband
can
tell
us
the
story
put
in
grant
fetch
he
had
not
moved
ere
the
front
door
bell
rang
a
second
time
is
owd
ben
himself
i
expect
said
hart
that
growled
furneaux
vexedly
hastening
to
forestall
minnie
but
it
was
doris
martin
and
very
pretty
she
looked
as
she
entered
the
room
her
high
color
being
the
joint
outcome
of
a
rapid
walk
and
a
very
natural
embarrassment
at
finding
the
frankly
admiring
eyes
of
a
stranger
fixed
on
her
quite
know
why
here
she
said
with
a
nervous
laugh
addressing
grant
directly
will
think
i
am
always
gazing
in
the
direction
of
but
my
room
commands
this
house
so
fully
that
i
can
not
help
seeing
or
hearing
anything
unusual
a
few
minutes
ago
i
heard
what
i
thought
was
a
muffled
gunshot
i
looked
out
and
saw
your
window
thrown
open
though
the
light
was
dim
and
only
a
candle
was
showing
in
the
smaller
window
i
was
alarmed
so
came
to
inquire
what
had
happened
pardon
me
you
jack
i
implore
you
and
let
me
apologize
for
you
pleaded
hart
this
is
my
good
friend
wally
hart
smiled
grant
you
sit
down
we
have
an
exciting
story
for
will
be
horribly
anxious
if
he
knows
i
have
gone
nevertheless
there
was
sufficient
spice
of
mother
eve
in
doris
that
she
should
take
the
proffered
chair
to
interrupt
broke
in
furneaux
you
meet
robinson
came
by
way
of
the
bridge
is
no
other
way
unless
one
makes
a
detour
by
bush
the
detective
whirled
round
on
grant
room
is
over
this
one
in
the
kitchen
with
her
mother
see
that
she
come
upstairs
while
absent
you
three
keep
on
said
hart
doris
more
now
read
the
meaning
of
the
quip
promptly
grant
has
often
spoken
of
you
she
said
talk
and
so
divinity
came
the
retort
may
be
a
parrot
but
i
want
my
neck
wrung
when
encourage
him
doris
said
grant
be
here
till
the
best
you
can
do
you
had
better
leave
the
recital
to
me
laughed
hart
meanwhile
furneaux
had
stolen
noiselessly
to
the
bedroom
overhead
the
casement
window
was
had
noted
that
fact
while
in
the
garden
he
peeped
out
and
was
just
in
time
to
see
robinson
emulating
a
sioux
indian
on
the
the
policeman
removed
his
helmet
and
was
about
to
peer
cautiously
through
the
small
window
the
blood
ran
cold
what
if
hart
discovered
yet
another
ghost
home
he
said
in
sepulchral
tones
the
constable
positively
jumped
he
gaped
on
all
sides
in
real
terror
he
too
had
heard
tales
of
owd
ben
home
hissed
furneaux
leaning
out
then
the
other
looked
up
you
sir
he
gasped
sighing
with
relief
had
the
closest
shave
of
your
life
a
fellow
below
there
who
shoots
at
on
duty
be
in
kingdom
come
if
you
gaze
in
at
that
window
be
off
you
and
i
will
quarrel
if
you
do
as
i
bid
you
and
that
would
be
a
pity
because
i
want
to
inform
fowler
that
he
has
a
particularly
smart
man
in
well
sir
if
satisfied
i
and
away
went
the
eavesdropper
crushed
still
tingling
with
that
fear
of
the
supernatural
latent
in
every
heart
but
far
from
convinced
furneaux
tripped
downstairs
the
routing
of
robinson
had
put
him
into
a
real
good
humor
he
found
the
three
in
the
gazing
at
the
felt
hat
young
lady
coming
with
me
he
said
grinning
amiably
sussex
constabulary
is
quelled
for
the
furneaux
i
recognize
that
hat
said
doris
and
it
was
notable
that
even
hart
remained
silent
the
detective
looked
at
her
strangely
but
put
no
question
am
almost
sure
it
belongs
to
our
local
amateur
dramatic
society
went
on
the
girl
was
worn
by
elkin
last
november
he
played
a
burlesque
of
svengali
i
was
trilby
and
caught
a
horrid
cold
from
walking
about
without
shoes
or
tell
me
any
more
was
surprising
comment
do
the
rest
but
let
me
remark
miss
martin
that
i
experienced
great
difficulty
not
so
long
ago
in
persuading
friend
grant
that
you
were
the
only
important
witness
this
case
has
provided
thus
far
playing
in
a
burlesque
were
you
been
similarly
engaged
the
farce
must
stop
now
it
makes
way
for
grim
tragedy
not
one
word
of
events
to
anyone
please
are
you
ready
doris
stood
up
hart
thrust
the
head
at
the
detective
he
said
you
honestly
mean
slinging
your
hook
without
making
any
inquiry
as
to
owd
ben
the
ghost
said
doris
eagerly
bateses
would
think
of
him
of
course
an
old
farmer
named
ben
robson
used
to
live
in
this
house
about
the
time
of
napoleon
he
was
suspected
by
the
authorities
to
be
an
agent
of
the
smugglers
and
the
story
goes
that
his
own
daughter
quarreled
with
him
and
betrayed
him
he
narrowly
escaped
hanging
owing
to
his
age
i
believe
and
was
sentenced
to
a
long
term
of
imprisonment
at
last
he
was
released
being
then
a
very
old
man
and
he
came
straight
here
and
strangled
his
daughter
it
is
quite
a
terrible
story
he
was
found
dead
by
her
side
then
people
remembered
that
she
had
spoken
of
someone
scaring
her
by
looking
in
through
that
small
window
some
nights
previously
naturally
a
ghost
was
soon
manufactured
i
really
wonder
why
the
man
who
rebuilt
and
renamed
the
place
in
the
middle
of
last
century
have
the
window
removed
i
began
the
work
of
demolition
tonight
said
hart
and
for
once
his
tone
was
serious
did
you
never
tell
me
that
scrap
of
history
doris
inquired
grant
liked
the
place
so
much
that
father
and
i
agreed
not
to
mar
your
enthusiasm
by
recalling
an
unpleasant
legend
she
said
frankly
that
what
related
true
the
record
appears
in
a
sussex
miscellany
of
those
years
oh
my
goodness
can
it
be
eleven
the
hall
clock
had
no
doubt
on
the
point
furneaux
pocketed
the
written
notes
regarding
ingerman
and
grabbed
the
hat
off
the
table
grant
for
some
reason
was
aware
that
the
detective
repressed
an
obvious
reference
to
the
last
occasion
on
which
the
girl
had
heard
that
same
clock
announce
the
hour
furneaux
would
allow
no
other
escort
he
and
doris
made
off
immediately
when
they
were
gone
hart
stared
fixedly
at
an
empty
decanter
dim
recollection
of
your
port
jack
is
that
it
was
a
wine
of
many
virtues
and
few
vices
he
mused
aloud
grant
took
the
hint
and
went
to
a
cellar
returning
he
found
his
crony
poring
over
the
book
which
singularly
enough
figured
prominently
on
each
occasion
when
the
window
was
markedly
in
evidence
hart
glanced
up
at
his
host
and
nodded
cheerfully
at
a
bottle
is
there
in
which
needed
so
much
research
he
asked
lines
by
sir
david
lindsay
quoted
by
scott
was
the
answer
these
they
and
hart
read
thing
is
certain
in
our
northern
land
allow
that
birth
or
valor
wealth
or
wit
give
each
precedence
to
their
possessor
envy
that
follows
on
such
eminence
as
comes
the
on
the
trace
shall
pull
them
down
each
said
grant
mentioned
the
fair
doris
will
be
true
in
luck
my
boy
but
somebody
is
out
for
your
blood
and
here
is
clear
warning
gee
whizz
if
i
remain
in
steynholme
a
week
i
shall
become
an
occultist
what
is
a
or
is
the
word
for
said
hart
will
appeal
to
furneaux
have
him
in
to
dinner
every
day
jack
a
tonic
furneaux
for
some
reason
known
only
to
himself
did
not
accompany
doris
to
the
post
office
once
they
were
across
the
bridge
and
the
broad
village
street
more
green
than
roadway
was
seen
to
be
empty
he
tapped
her
on
the
shoulder
and
said
pleasantly
away
home
now
little
girl
sleep
well
and
worry
the
tangle
will
right
itself
in
grant
is
suffering
she
ventured
to
murmur
a
good
thing
too
it
will
steady
him
hurry
please
wait
here
till
you
are
behind
a
locked
one
in
steynholme
will
hurt
me
she
said
never
can
tell
not
taking
any
chances
so
doris
sped
swiftly
up
the
hill
arrived
at
her
house
she
waved
a
hand
to
the
detective
who
flourished
his
straw
hat
in
response
a
fine
june
night
in
england
is
never
really
dark
so
the
two
could
not
only
see
each
other
but
when
doris
disappeared
furneaux
turning
sharply
on
his
heel
was
able
to
make
out
the
sudden
straightening
of
a
pucker
in
the
blind
of
a
room
in
abode
the
detective
walked
straight
there
and
tapped
lightly
on
the
window
robinson
after
an
affected
delay
came
to
the
door
there
he
demanded
if
you
know
laughed
furneaux
robinson
turned
a
key
and
looked
out
you
sir
he
cried
get
tired
of
saying
that
before
i
quit
steynholme
said
the
detective
i
come
in
no
show
a
light
here
chat
in
the
back
was
just
going
to
have
a
bite
of
supper
sir
began
robinson
apologetically
laid
in
the
kitchen
bread
and
cheese
a
glass
of
beer
will
you
join
me
pleasure
if
i
stuffed
myself
at
place
nice
fellow
grant
pity
you
and
he
seem
to
get
on
together
of
course
we
policemen
can
not
allow
friendship
to
interfere
with
duty
but
between
you
and
me
in
had
no
more
to
do
with
the
actual
murder
of
miss
melhuish
than
either
of
us
robinson
had
turned
up
a
lamp
and
hospitably
installed
furneaux
in
his
own
murder
you
said
sir
he
repeated
it
was
his
presence
at
which
brought
an
infatuated
woman
there
and
thus
directly
led
to
her
death
that
is
all
grant
is
telling
the
truth
i
assure
you
robinson
i
never
allow
myself
to
break
bread
with
a
man
whom
i
may
have
to
convict
so
change
my
mind
and
take
a
snack
of
your
bread
and
the
village
constable
by
no
means
a
fool
grinned
at
the
implied
tribute
what
he
did
not
appreciate
so
readily
was
the
fact
that
his
somewhat
massive
form
was
being
twiddled
round
the
little
finger
you
are
sir
he
cried
cheerily
if
grant
kill
miss
melhuish
who
did
all
probability
the
man
who
wore
that
hat
chirped
furneaux
taking
a
nondescript
bundle
from
a
coat
pocket
and
throwing
it
on
the
table
robinson
started
this
june
night
was
full
of
weird
surprises
he
set
down
a
jug
of
beer
with
a
intent
being
to
fill
two
glasses
already
in
position
from
which
circumstance
even
the
least
observant
visitor
might
deduce
a
robinson
hastily
flown
upstairs
he
examined
the
hat
as
though
it
were
a
new
form
of
bomb
gum
he
muttered
these
is
this
what
someone
fired
at
how
in
he
checked
himself
in
time
he
did
not
want
to
admit
that
he
had
been
watching
the
only
recognized
road
to
house
all
the
evening
so
chortled
furneaux
with
admirable
misunderstanding
quick
on
the
trigger
as
quick
as
that
friend
of
who
arrived
by
the
from
london
you
perceive
at
once
that
no
ordinary
head
could
have
worn
that
hat
without
having
its
hair
combed
by
the
same
bullet
it
was
stuck
on
to
a
thick
wig
now
tell
me
the
man
or
woman
in
steynholme
who
wears
a
wig
and
a
hat
like
that
and
you
and
i
will
guess
who
killed
miss
robinson
suspected
that
as
he
himself
would
have
put
it
his
leg
was
being
pulled
rather
violently
furneaux
read
his
face
like
a
printed
page
chewing
much
against
his
will
a
mouthful
of
bread
and
cheese
he
mumbled
in
solemn
broken
tones
a
play
then
the
policeman
was
convinced
galvanized
by
memory
as
it
were
gum
he
cried
again
a
charity
performance
last
furneaux
choked
with
excitement
chap
on
jury
he
gurgled
him
scoundrel
wonder
he
looked
wonder
indeed
how
oft
the
sight
of
means
to
do
ill
deeds
makes
ill
deeds
done
robinson
was
flabbergasted
he
could
only
murmur
elkin
in
a
dazed
way
a
drink
said
furneaux
sympathetically
wet
my
whistle
too
only
half
a
glass
please
now
we
jump
to
conclusions
this
elkin
looks
a
villain
but
may
not
be
one
that
is
to
say
his
villainy
may
be
confined
to
dealings
in
nags
but
you
see
robinson
what
a
queer
turn
this
affair
is
taking
we
must
get
rid
of
preconceived
notions
superintendent
fowler
and
you
and
i
will
go
into
this
matter
thoroughly
meanwhile
breathe
not
a
syllable
to
a
living
soul
if
i
were
you
let
grant
understand
that
we
regard
him
as
rather
outside
the
scope
of
our
inquiry
this
beer
is
very
good
for
a
country
village
you
know
a
good
thing
when
you
see
it
i
expect
pity
i
smoke
or
join
you
in
a
pipe
i
must
get
a
move
on
now
or
that
fat
landlord
will
be
locking
me
out
good
night

night
while
walking
up
the
hill
furneaux
fanned
himself
with
the
straw
hat
small
bit
of
my

evidently
a
hereditary
bequest
from
a
ass
he
communed
am
i
furneaux
plagued
beyond
endurance
by
a
murder
case
and
i
must
go
and
busy
myself
with
the
love
affair
of
a
daughter
and
a
novelist
when
tomlin
admitted
him
to
the
hare
and
hounds
he
buttonholed
the
landlord
who
at
that
hour
was
usually
somewhat
obfuscated
said
the
detective
gravely
am
told
that
you
steynholme
folk
indulge
occasionally
in
such
frivolities
as
amateur

x
the
case
against
grant
next
morning
after
a
long
conference
with
superintendent
fowler
from
which
to
his
great
chagrin
robinson
was
excluded
furneaux
went
to
the
post
office
dispatched
an
apparently
meaningless
telegram
to
a
code
address
and
exchanged
a
few
orthodox
remarks
with
doris
and
her
father
about
the
continued
fine
weather
while
he
was
yet
at
the
counter
ingerman
crossed
the
road
and
entered
the
shop
me

said
the
detective
musingly
committing
a
slight
trespass
on
your
garden
can
i
reach
the
yard
of
the
inn

the

doris
jefferson
went
to
knoleworth
early
and
took
her
maid
by
shopping
at
the
stores
there
they
save
their
fares
and
have
a
day
out
each
i
go
that
way
then
he
said
you
send
that
skivvy
of
yours
on
an
this
was
done
and
furneaux
made
the
desired
transit
now
tomlin
to
whom
the
comings
and
goings
of
all
and
sundry
formed
the
staple
of
the
gossip
had
seen
the
detective
go
out
but
could
his
sollum
that
the
queer
little
man
had
not
returned
he
too
had
watched
ingerman
going
to
ten
minutes
later
elkin
came
down
the
hill
and
headed
for
the
same
rendezvous
five
minutes
more
and
hobbs
the
butcher
joined
the
others
tomlin
was
seething
with
curiosity
but
there
were
some
casual
customers
in
the
so
he
could
not
abandon
his
post
soon
however
ingerman
led
elkin
and
hobbs
to
the
inn
evidently
the
had
been
making
some
small
purchases
he
was
in
high
spirits
ordering
appetizers
before
the
meal
he
announced
that
he
was
returning
to
london
that
afternoon
but
would
be
in
steynholme
again
for
the
adjourned
inquest
matter
how
my
business
suffers
i
mean
to
see
this
affair
through
he
vowed
gentlemen
can
pretty
well
guess
my
private
convictions
you
were
good
enough
to
give
me
your
friendship
so
i
spoke
as
openly
as
one
dares
when
no
charge
has
actually
been
laid
against
any
particular
said
elkin
with
whom
sunshine
seemed
to
disagree
because
he
looked
miserably
know
what
you
mean
ingerman
if
the
police
were
half
sharp
have
nabbed
their
man
before
this
did
you
put
any
water
in
this
gin
tomlin
wheezed
tomlin
indignantly
no
offense
i
taste
anything
i
believe
i
could
swallow
dope
and
not
feel
it
on
my
do
look
bad
no

fred
agreed
hobbs
you
yerself
every
man
to
his
trade
sez
i
give
foxton

his
medicine
regular
perhaps
i
need
a

lunnon
said
hobbs
with
a
broad
wink
of
medicine
i
mean
not
leaving
steynholme
till
things
make
a
move
my
next
trip
to
london
will
be
my
look
like
a
honeymooner
i
think
guffawed
hobbs
laugh
if
i
told
what
you
really
look
like
cried
elkin
angrily

put

or
shut
up
furneaux
peeped
in
through
a
door
always
open
which
led
to
the
stairs
i
have
my
account
tomlin
he
said
going
to
town
by
the
next
mean
to
say
furneaux
that
you
are
abandoning
the
case
so
soon
broke
in
ingerman
i
say
that
inquired
the
detective
meekly

at
our
worthy
landlord

drawing
inferences
as
well
as
corks
and
beat

indeed
gazing
at
his

he
gurgled

crooked
a
waggish
forefinger
at
him
the
wisest
among
us
may
err
last
night
for
instance
i
blundered
i
really
fancied
i
had
a
clew
to
the
steynholme
murderer
and
where
do
you
think
it
ended
in
the
loft
of
your
tomlin
in
a
box
of
old
clothes
at
that
silly
it

amatoor

elkin
grunted
though
intending
to
laugh
so
sharp
for
a
london
i
must
say
he
cried
those
props
have
been
there
since
before
i
know
now
was
the
downcast
reply
hours
ago
i
thought
differently
i
tomlin
tomlin
tried
hard
to
look

is
that
wot
you
wur
at
he
said
me
mister
i
could
soon
put
you
right
you
tole
well
be
helped
i
may
do
better
in
london
what
do
say
ingerman
the
city
is
the
real
mint
of
money
and
crime
who
knows
but
that
a
stroll
through
cornhill
may
have
some
bearing
on
the
steynholme
mystery
be
get
a
bit
nearer
if
you
took
a
stroll
along
the
knoleworth
road
and
not
so
very
far
either
guffawed
elkin
knows
repeated
furneaux
sadly
gentlemen
some
of
this
merry
party
will
meet
again
of
course
if
not
here
at
the
assizes
forget
my
bill
tomlin
by
the
way
one
egg
at
breakfast
had
seen
vicissitudes
it
be
rated
too
traveling
by
your
train
cried
ingerman
i
understood
said
furneaux
over
his
shoulder
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
after
he
had
gone
ingerman
looked
thoughtful
even
puzzled
he
was
casting
back
in
his
mind
to
discover
just
how
and
when
the
detective
that
his
departure
was
imminent
since
he
himself
had
only
arrived
at
a
decision
after
leaving
the
chap
is
no
good
announced
elkin
back
old
robinson
against
him
any
he
may
you
muttered
the
landlord
care
if
he
does
cornhill
what
the
blazes
has
cornhill
to
do
with
the
murder
at
ingerman
appreciated
the
value
of
that
concluding
phrase
elkin
had
used
it
once
before
in
shop
and
was
quietly
reproved
by
the
chemist
for
his
outspokenness
ingerman
however
did
not
inform
the
company
that
his
office
lay
in
an
alley
off
cornhill
he
elected
to
rub
in
words
siddle
seemed
to
object
to
being
mentioned
as
the
scene
of
the
crime
he
said
wonder
why
an
old
snapped
the
everyone
is
like
himself
a
regular
tomlin
closed
the
door
into
the
passage
closed
it
for
the
first
time
in
living
memory
whereat
furneaux
on
the
landing
above
grinned
sardonically
and
ran
downstairs
this
about
them
amatoor
he
inquired
portentously
the
key
of
that
box
have
said
elkin
locked
it
after
the
last
performance
and
unless
been
up
to
any
monkey
tricks
tomlin
the
duds
are
there
me
off
all
the
fred
protested
the
aggrieved
landlord
the
gin
was
wrong
now
supposed
to
rummidged
yur
box
wot
for
furneaux
popped
in
bill
ready
he
squeaked
sir
the
at
two
but
driving
to
knoleworth
with
superintendent
the
door
closed
behind
him
tomlin
shook
his
head
i
reckon
he
said
darkly
turning
to
a
ledger
neither
at
knoleworth
nor
victoria
did
ingerman
catch
sight
of
the
detective
though
he
was
anxious
either
to
make
the
journey
in
the
company
of
the
representative
of
scotland
yard
or
arrange
an
early
appointment
with
him
true
he
was
not
inclined
to
place
the
little
man
on
the
same
high
plane
as
that
suggested
by
certain
london
journalists
to
whom
he
had
spoken
but
he
wanted
to
win
the
confidence
of
in
connection
with
this
case
and
the
belief
that
he
was
being
avoided
was
nettling
he
found
consolation
of
a
sort
in
the
illustrated
papers
one
especially
contained
two
pages
of
local
pictures
grant
addressing
the
crowd
with
full
text
was
very
effective
while
there
were
admirable
studies
of
and
the
of
the
his
own
portrait
was
not
flattering
the
sun
had
etched
his
mephistophelian
features
rather
sharply
whereas
grant
looked
a
very
fine
fellow
ingerman
would
have
been
more
than
surprised
were
he
privileged
to
overhear
a
conversation
which
began
and
ended
before
he
reached
his
flat
in
north
kensington
furneaux
who
had
jumped
into
the
fore
part
of
the
train
at
knoleworth
and
was
out
in
a
jiffy
at
victoria
handed
his
bag
to
a
station
detective
and
turned
into
vauxhall
bridge
road
one
of
the
quietest
of
main
thoroughfares
there
he
met
a
big
man
dressed
in
tweeds
whose
manifest
concern
at
the
moment
seemed
to
center
in
a
rather
bad
wrapping
of
a
very
good
cigar
how
goes
it
charles
cried
the
big
man
heartily
affecting
to
be
aware
of
presence
when
the
latter
had
walked
nearly
a
hundred
yards
down
a
comparatively
deserted
street
wrong
with
the
toofa
inquired
furneaux
testily
own
carelessness
stupid
things
bands
on
cigars
well
the
rush
a

to
steynholme
at
five
i
want
you
to
take
hold
i
must
have
help
like
your
cigar

case
has
come
james
leander
winter
chief
inspector
under
the
criminal
investigation
department
whistled
softly
tut
he
said
can
never
trust
the
newspapers
reading
this
particulars
it
looked
dead
me
how
it
struck
you
sometimes
the
uninformed
brain
is
vouchsafed
a
gleam
of
unconscious
winter
appeared
to
be
devoting
his
mind
to
circumventing
the
vagaries
of
a
fragile
he
was
a
man
of
powerful
build
over
forty
heavy
but
active
with
bulging
blue
eyes
which
radiated
kindliness
and
strength
of
character
the
press
photographer
described
him
accurately
to
grant
the
average
londoner
would
have
taken
him
for
a
county
gentleman
on
a
visit
to
the
agricultural
show
at
islington
with
a
morning
at
as
a
variant
yet
sam
extensive
and
peculiar
knowledge
of
london
compared
with
his
as
a
with
a
of
a
university
it
would
be
hard
to
assess
in
coin
of
the
realm
the
value
of
the
political
and
social
secrets
stowed
away
in
that
big
head
i
must
put
a
question
or
two
he
said
smiling
at
a
baby
which
cooed
at
him
from
the
shaded
depths
of
a
passing
perambulator
there
another
woman
the
daughter
doris
pretty
little
bird
of
course
that
is
good
and
grant
a
lothario
chap
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
murder
he
was
giving
doris
a
lesson
in
astronomy
in
the
garden
of
heard
it
called
time
the
statement
happens
to
be
strictly
injun
sure
of
it
if
anything
the
death
of
adelaide
melhuish
cleared
the
scales
off
their
eyes
those
two
have
never
kissed
or
be
starting
quite
soon
old
is
doris
a
really
girl
of
nineteen
must
have
had
admirers
before
grant
went
to
the
had
and
has
having
educated
herself
out
of
the
rut
however
she
left
many
runners
at
the
post
one
is
youngish
named
elkin
adelaide
melhuish
probably
saw
her
with
grant
neither
doris
nor
grant
knew
that
adelaide
melhuish
as
such
was
in
steynholme
that
is
to
say
the
girl
had
seen
miss
melhuish
in
the
post
office
and
recognized
her
as
a
famous
actress
but
that
is
all
and
now
i
tell
you
any
more
or
know
all
that
i
know
which
is
too
the
cigar
was
behaving
itself
at
last
having
burnt
down
to
the
fracture
so
thoughts
could
be
given
exclusively
to
the
less
important
matter
of
the
steynholme
affair
begin
with
he
said
instantly
can
establish
a
i
imagined
but
a
bad
lot
i
throw
in
that
item
the
pair
walked
in
silence
until
vauxhall
bridge
was
in
sight
winter
pulled
out
a
watch
time
did
you
say
my
train
left
victoria
he
inquired
of
time
yet
to
make
your
guess
and
listen
to
further
details
scoffed
furneaux
i
give
it
up
but
if
i
must
share
in
the
hunt
i
tell
you
now
that
metaphorically
speaking
i
shall
cling
to
the
daughter
till
torn
away
by
sheer
force
of
furneaux
dug
his
colleague
in
the
ribs
the
effect
of
constant
association
with
me
james
he
cackled
gleefully
years
ago
you
would
have
pounced
on
elkin
hit
it
a
prood
mon
the
day
the
pupil
is
equaling
the
little
rat
i
had
hanged
my
first
murderer
before
you
knew
the
meaning
of
turn
now
and
get
to
few
treasury
barristers
leading
for
the
crown
could
have
marshaled
the
facts
with
such
lucidity
and
fairness
as
furneaux
during
that
saunter
to
victoria
station
extenuate
nor
set
down
aught
in
malice
said
othello
to
lodovico
and
these
scotland
yard
men
charged
with
so
great
a
responsibility
never
forgot
the
advice
when
winter
took
his
seat
in
the
train
at
five
he
could
have
drawn
a
plan
of
steynholme
which
he
had
never
seen
and
marked
thereon
the
exact
position
of
each
house
mentioned
in
this
record
moreover
he
was
acquainted
with
the
chief
characters
by
sight
as
it
were
and
finally
he
and
furneaux
had
arranged
a
plan
of
campaign
furneaux
refreshed
a
jaded
intellect
by
an
evening
at
the
opera
next
morning
at
eleven
he
was
inquiring
for
ingerman
at
an
office
in
a
certain
alley
off
cornhill
a
smart
youth
interposed
a
printed
formula
between
the
visitor
and
a
door
marked
furneaux
wrote
his
name
and
put
in
the
space
reserved
for
he
was
admitted
at
once
ingerman
apparently
was
immersed
in
a
pile
of
letters
but
he
swept
them
all
aside
and
greeted
the
caller
affably
to
see
you
furneaux
he
said
missed
you
on
the
train
yesterday
did
quiet
place
got
here
ingerman
interrupted
the
detective
but
as
i
was
about
furnished
too
went
on
furneaux
dreamily
carpets
and
rugs
restful
decorations
those
etchings
also
show
taste
in
the
selection
fitting
sequel
to
a
child
in
such
matters
but
my
honor
if
tempted
to
pour
out
my
savings
into
the
lap
of
a
city
magnate
i
would
disgorge
here
more
readily
than
in
some
of
finance
where
the
new
mahogany
glistens
and
the
typewriters
click
like
ingerman
was
nettled
he
glanced
at
his
correspondence
have
a
somewhat
notion
of
my
position
he
said
with
a
staccato
quality
in
his
velvet
voice
am
not
a
magnate
and
i
toil
here
to
make
not
to
lose
money
for
my
noble
ideal
forgive
me
if
my
rhapsody
took
the
wrong
sure
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
now
put
the
question
which
leads
to
the
probable
cause
of
your
visit
did
you
travel
by
the
two
train
yesterday
i
avoided
you
i
ask
why
mind
was
weary
i
wanted
my
wits
about
me
when
i
tackled
ingerman
smiled
and
leaned
back
resting
both
elbows
on
the
arms
of
the
chair
and
bringing
the
tips
of
his
fingers
together
he
said
prefer
that
i
should
drag
out
a
statement
piecemeal
rather
than
receive
it
it
that
way
if
you
shall
even
enjoy
it
to
clear
the
ground
are
you
the
isidor
ingerman
who
exploited
the
mine
in
abyssinia
whitened
under
a
sudden
pressure
but
his
voice
remained
calm
unfortunate
episode
he
said
the
aegean
transport
company
limited
which
i
was
inveigled
by
greeks
but
why
this
history
of
ruined
enterprises
a
sort
of
schooling
i
have
noticed
that
the
smartest
counsel
invariably
begin
with
a
few
fireworks
in
order
to
induce
the
proper
frame
of
mind
in
a
that
mean
that
you
want
me
to
blurt
out
bitter
and
prejudiced
accusations
against
grant
want
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
about
the
death
of
your
wife
you
forced
the
role
on
me
doing
my
ingerman
kept
silent
during
many
seconds
when
he
spoke
his
cultured
voice
was
suave
as
ever
it
was
my
fault
furneaux
he
said
gave
me
a
strong
hint
i
should
have
taken
it
and
we
might
have
started
an
interesting
chat
on
pleasanter
lines
so
with
apologies
for
my
insistence
about
the
train
i
make
a
fresh
start
i
believe
firmly
that
grant
was
directly
concerned
in
the
murder
and
i
shall
justify
my
belief
within
the
past
fortnight
a
between
my
wife
and
myself
became
possible
it
was
spoken
of
even
reduced
to
the
written
word
i
have
her
letters
mine
should
be
found
among
her
belongings
may
i
take
it
that
they
been
found
said
furneaux
so
far
so
good
my
poor
wife
reached
the
parting
of
the
ways
she
saw
that
her
life
was
becoming
an
empty
husk
i
think
the
theater
was
palling
on
her
but
i
see
now
that
she
still
cherished
the
dream
of
winning
the
man
she
me
her
husband
but
that
handsome
dilettante
grant
i
take
it
therefore
that
she
went
to
steynholme
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
glamour
of
the
past
was
really
dead
unfortunately
she
witnessed
certain
idyllic
passages
between
her
lover
and
a
charming
village
girl
imagine
the
effect
of
this
discovery
on
one
of
the
artistic
temperament
hath
no
fury
like
a
woman
scorned
and
my
unhappy
wife
would
lash
herself
into
an
emotional
frenzy
she
would
tear
a
passion
to
rags
her
very
training
on
the
stage
would
come
to
her
aid
in
scathing
threats
if
grant
remained
cold
to
her
appeal
the
village
beauty
should
be
made
to
suffer
then
would
flame
into
storm
and
so
the
of
tragedy
spread
its
poisonous
shade
until
reason
fled
and
some
demon
whispered
i
find
no
flaw
in
my
theory
it
explains
the
inexplicable
now
how
does
it
strike
you
furneaux
that
so
i
have
the
advantage
of
course
in
knowing
my
peculiarities
and
i
have
made
some
study
of
grant
he
admits
already
that
he
is
under
suspicion
why
if
he
is
innocent
mind
you
i
pay
little
heed
to
the
crude
disposal
of
the
body
horace
i
think
has
a
truism
that
art
lies
in
concealing
art
my
presence
in
steynholme
was
no
secret
she
would
have
been
missed
from
the
inn
search
would
be
made
the
murder
must
be
revealed
sooner
or
later
and
the
murderer
himself
was
aware
that
by
no
twisting
or
turning
could
his
name
escape
association
with
that
of
his
victim
why
not
face
the
music
at
once
he
would
argue
the
very
simplicity
of
the
means
adopted
to
fasten
a
kind
of
responsibility
on
him
might
prove
his
best
safeguard
even
now
i
doubt
whether
any
jury
will
find
him
guilty
on
the
evidence
as
it
stands
but
my
duty
to
my
unhappy
wife
demands
that
i
shall
strengthen
the
arm
of
justice
by
every
legitimate
means
in
my
that
your
case
ingerman
present
assumes
that
the
police
adopt
your
necessarily
the
police
must
do
their
work
without
fear
or
favor
but
grant
can
be
committed
for
trial
on
a
is
certainly
in
an
awkward
a
little
while
ago
you
dismissed
my
theory
of
the
crime
as
airy
was
before
you
quoted
horace
i
have
a
great
respect
for
horace
his
ode
to
the
new
year
is
a
you
care
to
see
my
recent
letters
you
are
at
my
flat
send
you
copies
the
originals
are
always
at
your
disposal
for
comparison
of
course
now
may
i
without
offense
ask
a
question
it
wise
that
the
emissary
of
scotland
yard
should
leave
steynholme
i
tell
you
that
i
might
obtain
light
in
the
neighborhood
of
cornhill
i
could
have
given
you
the
facts
in
a
greater
believer
in
what
the
theater
people
call
some
of
your
facts
ingerman
remind
me
of
an
report
in
a
mining
prospectus
when
tested
by
cyanide
of
potassium
the
gold
in
the
ore
often
changes
into
iron
pyrites
but
hug
the
delusion
that
i
shall
neglect
steynholme
the
murderer
is
there
not
in
london
and
unless
my
intellect
is
failing
he
will
be
tried
for
his
life
at
the
next
lewes
assizes
meanwhile
may
i
give
you
a
bit
of
advice
all
a
sound
lawyer
one
who
will
avoid
needless
good
day
send
those
letters
to
the
yard
by
post
if
shall
be
when
the
door
closed
on
furneaux
ingerman
smiled
given
that
little
frenchman
furiously
to
think
he
murmured
but
the
was
smiling
too
he
had
elaborated
the
scheme
already
discussed
with
winter
it
was
much
to
his
liking
though
unorthodox
rather
more
than
risky
and
altogether
opposed
to
the
instructions
of
the
police
manual
each
of
these
drawbacks
was
a
commendation
to
furneaux
in
fact
the
steynholme
mystery
had
taken
quite
a
favorable
turn
during
that
talk
with
ingerman
chapter
xi
robinson
takes
another
line
about
the
time
furneaux
was
whisked
past
in
superintendent
dogcart
grant
and
hart
were
finishing
luncheon
and
planning
a
long
walk
to
the
sea
grant
would
dearly
have
liked
to
secure
company
but
good
taste
forbade
that
he
should
even
invite
her
to
share
the
ramble
thus
the
death
of
a
woman
with
whom
he
had
not
exchanged
a
word
during
three
years
had
already
set
up
a
barrier
between
doris
and
himself
though
impalpable
it
was
effective
it
could
neither
be
climbed
nor
avoided
quiet
little
steynholme
had
suddenly
become
a
rigid
censor
of
morals
and
etiquette
until
this
evil
thing
was
annihilated
by
slow
process
of
law
doris
and
he
might
meet
only
by
chance
and
never
remain
long
together
when
the
two
were
ready
to
start
hart
elected
to
dispense
with
his
south
american
sombrero
am
sensitive
to
ridicule
he
professed
village
urchins
will
christen
me
ben
and
the
old
character
was
such
that
i
would
feel
hurt
so
for
join
the
no
hat
wonder
if
meet
furneaux
said
grant
selecting
a
odd
that
we
should
have
seen
nothing
of
him
this
would
be
still
more
odd
if
we
had
remembering
the
precautions
he
took
not
to
be
observed
coming
here
last
so
i
forgot
to
ask
the
reason
there
was
one
i
the
best
that
little
man
is
a
live
wire
of
intelligence
wasted
on
scotland
yard
he
ought
to
be
a
dramatist
or
an
alternatives
at
all
each
profession
demands
brains
and
is
at
its
best
in
coining
cute
phrases
met
scores
of
both
tribes
and
like
as
peas
in
a
a
bell
rang
the
front
door
said
grant
furneaux
himself
i
but
the
visitor
was
robinson
who
actually
smiled
and
saluted
caught
you
before
you
went
out
sir
he
said
furneaux
asked
me
to
tell
you
he
had
to
hurry
back
to
london
i
was
also
to
mention
that
he
had
got
the
whiskers
whose
whiskers
all
he
said
got
the
owd
whiskers
of
course
how
dense
you
are
jack
put
in
hart
now
this
was
the
first
robinson
had
heard
of
whiskers
in
connection
with
the
crime
he
remembered
as
svengali
of
course
and
could
have
kicked
himself
for
not
associating
earlier
a
set
of
sable
whiskers
with
the
black
wig
and
the
hat
but
owd
ben
what
figure
did
that
redoubtable
ghost
cut
in
the
mystery
are
certain
in
your
otherwise
vigorous
and
thrilling
story
constable
went
on
hart
likely
sir
agreed
robinson
much
to
the
surprise
of
his
hearers
he
had
not
the
slightest
notion
what
a
or
its
plural
signified
he
was
only
adopting
advice
and
trying
to
be
civil
you
see
that
do
you
said
hart
fill
in
when
where
and
how
did
the
midget
sleuth
obtain
the
hairy
adornments
the
policeman
whose
wits
were
thoroughly
on
the
alert
realized
that
he
had
scored
a
point
though
he
knew
not
how
did
not
tell
me
sir
he
answered
a
rum
business
what
it
is
no
matter
what
way
you
look
at
grant
agreeably
aware
of
the
village
change
of
front
accepted
the
olive
branch
readily
just
going
for
a
walk
he
said
you
have
ten
minutes
to
spare
bates
will
find
you
some
luncheon
i
have
no
sir
meals
are
a
trifle
irregular
during
a
busy
time
like
this
admitted
robinson
feeling
that
his
luck
was
in
because
tongues
would
surely
be
loosened
in
the
kitchen
to
an
official
guest
introduced
by
the
master
of
the
establishment
he
was
right
no
member
of
the
bates
family
dreamed
of
reticence
now
that
the
household
was
restored
to
favor
with
before
robinson
departed
he
was
full
of
information
and
good
food
what
more
natural
then
an
hour
later
than
that
he
should
contrive
to
meet
elkin
as
the
was
taking
home
a
lively
pony
he
had
been
on
a
strip
of
common
opposite
his
house
each
was
eager
to
question
the
other
but
elkin
opened
fire
fresh
he
cried
have
a
fair
course
now
robinson
that
little
london
has
bunked
he
in
the
language
of
the
ring
robinson
thought
fit
to
spar
for
an
opening
none
of
your
said
elkin
stroking
the
nervous
neck
know
he
has
you
miss
much
going
on
bet
you
half
a
thick
have
put
someone
in
clink
before
this
if
the
murder
at
had
been
left
in
your
as
may
be
elkin
but
this
affair
seems
to
have
gripped
you
for
fair
you
look
thoroughly
run
down
badly
hardly
got
a
wink
last
be
out
so
late
why
a
week
ago
you
were
in
bed
regular
at
inquest
broke
up
the
day
yesterday
so
i
was
delayed
at
time
did
you
reach
home
if
i
know
after
twelve
before
i
was
in
bed
by
the
way
this
about
things
missing
from
a
box
owned
by
the
amateur
dramatic
society
that
silly
josser
of
a
his
name
said
robinson
who
was
clever
enough
not
to
appear
too
secretive
and
was
thanking
his
stars
that
elkin
had
introduced
the
very
topic
he
wanted
to
discuss
furneaux
i
remember
now
he
worried
old
tomlin
last
night
about
that
box
which
is
kept
in
the
loft
over
the
so
tomlin
and
i
and
hobbs
just
to
satisfy
ourselves
went
up
there
as
soon
as
furneaux
left
and
what
do
you
think
the
box
was
unlocked
though
i
locked
it
myself
and
have
the
key
and
a
hat
and
wig
and
whiskers
i
wore
when
we
played
a
skit
on
were
missing
if
that
a
clew
what
is
clew
repeated
the
bewildered
robinson
telling
you
though
i
kept
dark
before
the
other
fellows
you
say
cheek
was
bleeding
on
tuesday
morning
the
whiskers
were
held
on
by
wires
that
slip
over
the
ears
one
wire
was
sharp
as
a
needle
i
know
because
it
stuck
into
a
finger
more
than
once
why
it
scratch
a
cheek
and
the
cut
open
again
next
morning
jing
got
your
knife
into
grant
no
mistake
commented
robinson
yourself
gave
him
a
nasty
jab
at
the
inquest
sneered
elkin
was
just
the
am
i
think
you
ought
to
know
about
that
hat
and
the
other
things
i
would
recognize
them
anywhere
furneaux
had
something
up
his
sleeve
too
or
he
have
pumped
tomlin
woa
boy
so
long
robinson
i
must
put
this
youngster
into
his
wait
elkin
said
robinson
solemnly
want
to
have
a
word
with
the
policeman
was
glad
of
the
respite
he
needed
time
to
collect
his
thoughts
the
story
of
the
and
its
excitement
disposed
completely
of
malicious
theory
with
regard
to
grant
but
since
the
was
minded
to
be
communicative
it
would
be
well
to
encourage
him
in
and
have
a
drink
said
elkin
when
the
colt
had
been
stabled
when
on
elkin
raised
his
eyebrows
sarcastically
he
could
not
possibly
guess
that
robinson
was
adopting
pose
of
never
accepting
hospitality
from
a
man
whom
he
might
have
to
arrest
blaze
away
the
younger
man
leaned
against
a
gate
he
looked
ill
and
physically
worn
business
has
kept
you
out
late
of
a
night
recently
you
say
elkin
began
the
other
speaking
as
casually
as
he
could
contrive
it
might
help
a
lot
if
you
can
call
to
mind
anyone
you
met
on
the
roads
at
ten
or
eleven
for
instance
last
elkin
laughed
in
a
queer
croaking
way
night
my
mare
brought
me
home
i
was
decidedly
sprung
robinson
glad
you
spot
me
or
there
might
have
been
trouble
what
between
the
inquest
no
food
more
than
a
few
drinks
at
knoleworth
have
passed
owd
ben
himself
without
seeing
him
though
i
believe
i
did
squint
in
at
as
i
went
time
would
that
be
soon
after
be
certain
to
ten
minutes
or
so
the
pubs
closed
when
i
left
knoleworth
what
the
devil
does
it
matter
anyhow
it
mattered
a
great
deal
robinson
could
testify
that
elkin
did
not
cross
steynholme
bridge
after
much
was
the
answer
see
anxious
to
find
out
who
might
be
stirring
at
that
hour
you
know
everybody
for
miles
around
like
to
fix
your
journey
by
the
clock
if
i
it
all
man
i
was
full
to
the
eyes
there
you
have
it
you
out
on
monday
night
night
of
the
murder
left
the
hare
and
hounds
at
ten
and
came
straight
was
there
with
you
usual
and
siddle
and
bob
smith
and
a
commercial
traveler
siddle
went
at
half
past
nine
but
he
generally
met
no
one
on
the
road
the
monosyllable
seemed
to
lack
usual
confidence
it
sounded
as
if
he
had
been
making
up
his
mind
what
to
say
yet
faltered
at
the
last
moment
robinson
ruminated
darkly
as
a
matter
of
fact
long
after
eleven
on
that
fateful
night
he
himself
had
seen
elkin
walking
homeward
he
was
well
aware
that
the
licensing
hours
were
not
strictly
observed
by
the
hare
and
hounds
when
were
in
residence
closing
time
was
ten
but
the
being
cheery
souls
became
nominal
hosts
on
such
occasions
and
their
guests
were
in
no
hurry
to
depart
robinson
saw
that
he
had
probably
jumped
to
a
conclusion
an
acrobatic
feat
of
reasoning
which
furneaux
had
specifically
warned
him
against
at
any
rate
he
resolved
now
to
leave
well
enough
alone
we
seem
to
get
any
forrarder
he
said
ought
to
take
more
care
of
your
health
elkin
a
changed
man
these
be
all
right
when
this
murder
is
off
our
chests
robinson
you
have
a
tiddley
so
long
robinson
walked
slowly
toward
steynholme
at
a
turn
in
the
road
he
halted
near
the
footpath
which
led
down
the
wooded
cliff
and
across
the
river
to
bush
walk
he
surveyed
the
locality
with
a
reflective
frown
then
there
being
no
one
about
he
made
some
notes
of
the
chat
with
elkin
the
candor
and
his
misstatements
were
equally
puzzling
none
knew
better
than
the
policeman
that
the
vital
discrepancy
of
fully
an
hour
and
a
half
on
the
monday
night
would
be
difficult
to
clear
up
tomlin
of
course
would
have
no
recollection
of
events
after
ten
but
the
commercial
traveler
who
could
be
traced
might
be
induced
to
tell
the
truth
if
assured
that
the
police
needed
the
information
solely
for
purposes
in
connection
with
their
inquiry
into
the
murder
that
man
must
be
found
his
testimony
should
have
an
immense
significance
that
evening
shortly
before
seven
a
stalwart
gentleman
in
tweeds
from
the
london
express
at
knoleworth
the
local
train
for
steynholme
stood
in
a
bay
on
the
opposite
platform
and
this
passenger
in
particular
was
making
for
it
when
he
nearly
collided
with
another
man
younger
thinner
bespectacled
who
hailed
him
with
delight
too
good
egg
was
the
cry
the
gentleman
thus
addressed
did
not
seem
to
relish
this
geniality
the
deuce
are
you
off
to
he
demanded
as
you
of
here
peters
a
word
in
your
ear
if
you
know
me
during
the
next
few
days
never
know
me
again
i
suppose
be
staying
at
the
local
only
one
of
any
repute
in
the
place
so
got
you
may
i
take
it
that
you
will
reciprocate
when
the
time
comes
i
ever
failed
you
we
meet
as
peters
bustled
off
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
the
smartest
in
london
of
mystery
cases
the
steynholme
affair
had
interested
both
him
and
a
shrewd
the
pair
arrived
at
the
hare
and
hounds
within
a
few
minutes
of
each
other
the
big
man
registered
as
franklin
peters
ordered
a
chop
and
went
off
at
once
to
interview
the
local
policeman
franklin
took
more
pains
over
the
prospective
meal
you
a
nice
chicken
he
inquired
yes
tomlin
had
a
veritable
spring
chicken
in
the
larder
at
that
moment
do
you
think
your
cook
could
provide
a
sir
wheezed
tomlin
the
visitor
explained
he
liked
variety
he
said
half
the
chicken
might
be
deviled
for
breakfast
the
two
dishes
with
plain
boiled
potatoes
and
french
beans
would
suit
him
admirably
he
was
sorry
he
dared
not
try
excellent
claret
but
a
dominating
doctor
had
put
him
on
the
in
effect
franklin
impressed
the
landlord
as
a
man
of
taste
and
ample
means
peters
had
gobbled
his
chop
before
franklin
entered
the
but
they
met
later
in
the
snug
where
elkin
was
being
chaffed
by
hobbs
anent
his
on
in
knoleworth
the
previous
night
siddle
came
in
but
the
chatter
was
not
so
free
as
when
the
habitués
had
the
place
to
themselves
now
peters
had
marked
the
gathering
as
one
that
suited
his
purpose
exactly
so
he
gave
the
conversation
the
right
twist
suppose
you
local
gentlemen
have
been
greatly
disturbed
by
this
sensational
murder
he
said
hobbs
took
refuge
in
a
glass
of
beer
siddle
gazed
contemplatively
at
his
neat
boots
tomlin
meant
to
say
something
elkin
eying
the
stranger
and
summing
him
up
as
a
detective
answered
brusquely
murder
is
bad
enough
but
the
police
are
worse
three
days
gone
and
nothing
done
murder
are
you
discussing
may
i
ask
put
in
franklin
peters
turned
on
him
with
astonishment
in
every
line
of
a
peculiarly
mobile
face
you
mean
to
say
sir
that
you
heard
of
the
steynholme
murder
he
gasped
seldom
if
ever
read
such
things
in
the
newspapers
and
as
i
landed
in
england
only
a
week
ago
from
france
my
ignorance
though
abyssmal
is
pardonable
moreover
i
can
say
truly
that
i
am
far
more
interested
in
pedigree
horses
than
in
vulgar
peters
explained
fluently
this
was
no
ordinary
crime
a
beautiful
and
popular
actress
had
been
done
to
death
in
a
brutal
way
and
the
country
was
already
deeply
stirred
by
the
story
elkin
waited
impatiently
till
the
journalist
drew
breath
then
he
broke
in
horses
you
mentioned
sir
he
said
his
rancor
against
grant
being
momentarily
conquered
by
the
pertinent
allusion
to
his
own
business
sort
racing
coaching
roadsters
or
hacks
sorts
the
argentine
where
i
have
connections
offers
an
door
to
good
you
having
a
look
round
there
are
several
decent
studs
within
driving
distance
of
steynholme
that
so
landlord
sir
said
tomlin
the
very
man
to
has
some
stuff
not
to
be
sneezed
that
so
franklin
gazed
at
elkin
in
a
very
friendly
manner
i
ask
your
name
sir
elkin
produced
a
card
every
hoof
in
his
stables
appreciated
in
value
forthwith
but
he
was
far
too
knowing
that
he
should
appear
to
rush
matters
any
day
you
like
sir
he
said
to
see
you
but
give
me
notice
i
generally
have
an
appetizer
here
of
a
morning
about
you
want
it
too
fred
said
hobbs
me
as
thin
as
a
stop
whiskey
drink
beer
like
you
might
also
follow
that
example
interposed
siddle
quietly
nodding
towards
franklin
that
snapped
elkin
worry
about
a
nice
thing
to
say
why
should
worry
about
the
the
chemist
made
no
reply
but
hobbs
stepped
into
the
breach
valiantly
yer
on
fred
he
vociferated
means
no
but
wot
else
are
yer
of
noon
night
elkin
laughed
with
his
queer
croak
you
stay
here
a
day
or
two
soon
get
to
know
what
driving
at
sir
he
said
to
franklin
fact
is
that
this
chap
grant
who
found
the
body
and
in
whose
garden
the
murder
was
committed
has
been
making
eyes
at
the
girl
as
good
as
engaged
to
that
would
make
anybody
it
smiled
franklin
course
there
is
always
the
point
of
view
the
sex
is
proverbially
fickle
you
know
thy
vows
are
traced
in
sand
lord
byron
has
some
too
guffawed
hobbs
about
peggy
smith
fred
elkin
blew
a
mouthful
of
cigarette
smoke
at
the
butcher
about
that
tough
old
bull
you
bought
at
knoleworth
on
monday
he
retorted
face
grew
purple
franklin
beckoned
to
tomlin
these
gentlemen
what
have
he
said
gently
the
landlord
made
a
clatter
of
glasses
and
the
threatened
storm
passed
aroused
my
curiosity
remarked
franklin
to
peters
but
taking
the
company
at
large
into
the
conversation
does
certainly
strike
one
as
a
remarkable
case
is
there
no
suspicion
yet
as
to
the
actual
murderer
whatever
said
peters
what
you
may
call
the
police
opinion
broke
in
elkin
steynholme
folk
have
a
pretty
clear
notion
i
can
assure
matter
is
still
and
may
remain
so
a
long
time
said
siddle
is
simply
stupid
to
attach
a
kind
of
responsibility
to
the
man
who
happens
to
occupy
the
house
associated
with
the
crime
i
have
no
patience
with
that
sort
of
hobbs
who
did
not
want
to
quarrel
with
elkin
suddenly
championed
him
all
very
well
he
rumbled
the
hevidence
you
me
siddle
the
hevidence
we
know
to
is
a
lot
stronger
than
sure
pardon
me
friends
said
siddle
rising
with
an
apologetic
smile
i
happen
to
be
foreman
of
the
jury
and
i
feel
that
this
matter
is
not
for
me
at
any
rate
to
discuss
out
he
went
not
even
heeding
appeal
to
drink
the
he
had
just
ordered
like
sighed
hobbs
fellow
would
find
hexcuses
for
a
black
elkin
talked
more
freely
now
that
the
disapproving
eye
was
off
him
ultimately
franklin
elected
to
smoke
a
cigar
in
the
open
air
and
strolled
forth
he
sauntered
down
the
hill
stood
on
the
bridge
and
admired
the
soft
blue
tones
of
the
landscape
in
the
half
light
of
a
summer
evening
shortly
before
closing
time
robinson
appeared
it
being
part
of
his
routine
duty
to
see
that
no
noisy
revelers
disturbed
the
peace
of
the
village
he
noticed
the
stranger
at
once
and
elected
to
walk
past
him
thus
he
received
yet
another
shock
when
franklin
addressed
him
by
name
evening
robinson
said
the
pleasant
voice
been
expecting
you
to
turn
up
kindly
go
back
home
and
leave
the
door
open
i
want
to
slip
in
quietly
i
am
chief
inspector
winter
of
scotland
say
so
sir
stammered
robinson
i
do
say
it
and
will
prove
it
to
you
of
course
be
with
you
in
a
minute
or
two
someone
coming
you
and
i
must
not
be
seen
robinson
made
off
and
winter
lounged
along
the
knoleworth
road
he
met
bates
going
to
the
post
with
letters
naturally
bates
looked
him
over
returning
from
the
post
office
he
kept
a
sharp
eye
for
the
unknown
loiterer
but
saw
him
not
he
even
walked
quickly
to
the
bend
of
the
road
but
the
other
man
had
vanished
grant
and
hart
were
talking
of
anything
but
the
murder
when
bates
thrust
his
head
in
he
was
grasping
his
goatee
beard
sure
sign
of
some
weight
on
his
mind
pardon
he
said
i
thought
like
to
know
the
place
is
just
with
inquired
hart
bates
stared
fixedly
at
the
speaker
for
a
second
or
two
sir
he
said
a
big
the
opposite
to
the
little
hawkshaw
i
i
to
tackle
this
customer
though
gim
me
a
by
the
looks
of
bates
had
disappeared
before
grant
remembered
that
the
press
photographer
had
mentioned
the
big
and
the
little
of
the
yard
i
wonder
he
said
his
wonder
could
hardly
have
equaled
had
he
heard
the
words
the
guess
was
a
distinct
score
for
blunt
sussex
though
it
was
founded
solely
on
the
assumption
that
all
comers
now
unless
bates
was
personally
acquainted
with
them
were
limbs
of
the
law
chapter
xii
wherein
winter
gets
to
work
winter
had
identified
bates
at
the
first
glance
the
letters
in
the
hand
too
showed
his
errand
so
while
the
gardener
was
climbing
the
hill
the
detective
slipped
into
cottage
he
found
the
policeman
awaiting
him
in
the
dark
because
a
voice
said
pardon
sir
but
the
other
gentleman
from
the
asked
me
to
take
him
into
the
kitchen
a
light
in
the
front
room
might
attract
attention
he
what
furneaux
would
suggest
and
i
agree
with
him
said
winter
quite
alive
to
the
canny
discretion
behind
those
words
other
robinson
led
the
way
supper
was
laid
on
the
table
poor
robinson
had
again
beaten
a
hasty
retreat
robinson
said
the
chief
inspector
affably
we
come
to
business
prove
my
bona
fides
here
is
my
official
card
and
run
quickly
through
events
until
i
met
furneaux
at
victoria
and
he
posted
me
fully
up
to
that
so
the
policeman
listened
to
a
clear
summary
of
the
steynholme
case
as
it
was
known
to
the
authorities
did
not
warn
either
fowler
or
you
of
my
visit
because
a
telegram
could
hardly
be
explicit
enough
concluded
winter
the
inn
i
am
franklin
an
argentine
importer
of
blood
stock
in
the
horse
line
at
this
moment
the
only
other
man
beside
yourself
in
steynholme
who
is
aware
of
my
official
position
is
peters
and
he
is
pledged
to
secrecy
or
any
other
day
until
further
notice
you
and
i
meet
as
strangers
in
public
by
the
way
furneaux
asked
me
to
tell
you
that
he
found
the
wig
and
the
false
beard
in
the
river
early
this
morning
the
wearer
had
apparently
flung
them
off
while
crossing
the
leading
from
bush
walk
having
forgotten
that
they
would
not
sink
readily
perhaps
he
care
at
any
rate
bullet
seems
to
have
laid
owd
ghost
now
what
of
this
fellow
elkin
he
worries
i
offer
you
a
glass
of
beer
sir
pleasure
may
i
smoke
while
you
eat
you
see
i
differ
from
furneaux
in
both
size
and
robinson
poured
out
the
beer
he
was
preternaturally
grave
the
somewhat
incriminating
statements
he
had
wormed
out
of
the
that
afternoon
lay
heavy
upon
him
but
he
told
his
story
succinctly
enough
winter
nodded
to
emphasize
each
point
and
congratulated
him
at
the
end
arranged
that
very
well
he
said
gather
though
that
elkin
spoke
rather
as
put
it
sir
he
tripped
a
bit
over
the
time
on
monday
night
but
only
fair
to
say
that
he
might
have
had
license
in
issue
will
be
settled
find
out
the
commercial
name
and
send
a
telegram
from
knoleworth
before
noon
who
is
peggy
smith
robinson
set
down
an
empty
glass
with
a
stare
of
surprise
daughter
sir
he
answered
doubt
but
sir
just
a
village
girl
her
father
is
a
blacksmith
his
forge
is
along
to
the
right
not
far
be
twenty
or
more
than
the
rest
of
you
seen
her
flirting
with
elkin
robinson
took
thought
that
i
come
to
think
of
it
she
might
be
given
a
bit
that
way
her
father
shoes
nags
so
a
lot
of
between
the
two
places
but
folks
would
always
look
on
it
as
natural
enough
yes
seen
together
more
than
that
case
he
can
hardly
grumble
if
the
daughter
has
an
eye
for
another
young
martin
snorted
robinson
look
the
side
of
the
road
he
was
on
fred
elkin
her
he
said
in
the
hare
and
hounds
that
he
and
miss
martin
were
practically
nonsense
sorry
sir
but
i
admire
doris
martin
i
like
to
see
a
girl
like
her
herself
out
of
the
common
gang
the
smartest
young
lady
in
the
village
not
an
atom
of
a
snob
no
no
she
for
fred
elkin
before
this
murder
cropped
up
everybody
would
have
it
that
grant
would
marry
does
the
murder
intervene
robinson
shifted
uneasily
in
his
chair
he
knew
only
too
well
that
he
himself
had
driven
a
wedge
between
the
two
a
funny
spot
sir
he
contrived
to
explain
it
came
out
that
doris
grant
were
in
the
garden
at
at
half
past
ten
on
monday
night
without
martin
where
his
daughter
was
been
talk
both
the
postmaster
the
girl
herself
are
up
to
it
you
can
see
it
in
their
faces
they
like
it
who
can
blame
indeed
but
this
he
had
some
ground
for
a
definite
boast
made
openly
among
people
acquainted
with
all
the
parties
more
than
elkin
would
marry
doris
if
she
lifted
a
finger
you
name
them
tomlin
wants
a
winter
laughed
joyously
he
cried
say
that
siddle
is
a
chemist
foreman
of
the
jury
appearances
he
is
a
likelier
candidate
than
either
elkin
or
tomlin
anybody
else
be
far
wrong
if
i
gave
you
the
name
of
most
among
the
young
unmarried
men
in
the
me
i
must
have
a
peep
at
this
charmer
but
i
want
those
names
winter
produced
a
so
he
was
evidently
taking
the
matter
seriously
the
policeman
however
was
flustered
his
thoughts
ran
on
elkin
whereas
this
masterful
person
from
london
insisted
on
discussing
doris
martin
difficulty
is
sir
that
she
has
never
company
with
any
of
he
said
mind
give
me
the
name
of
every
man
who
no
matter
what
his
position
or
prospects
might
be
irritated
if
no
more
if
he
knew
that
miss
martin
and
grant
were
presumably
spooning
in
a
garden
at
a
rather
late
it
was
a
totally
new
line
of
inquiry
for
robinson
but
he
bent
his
wits
to
it
and
evolved
a
list
which
if
published
would
certainly
be
regarded
with
incredulous
envy
by
every
other
girl
in
the
village
than
the
daughter
as
for
doris
herself
she
would
be
mightily
surprised
when
she
saw
it
but
whether
annoyed
or
secretly
gratified
none
but
a
pretty
girl
of
nineteen
can
tell
winter
departed
soon
afterwards
before
going
to
the
inn
he
had
a
look
at
the
forge
a
young
woman
standing
at
the
open
door
of
the
adjoining
cottage
favored
him
with
a
frank
stare
there
was
no
light
in
the
dwelling
when
he
returned
after
walking
a
little
way
down
the
road
the
door
was
closed
next
morning
bates
heard
of
peters
as
the
detective
and
of
franklin
as
a
from
south
america
moreover
he
scrutinized
both
in
the
flesh
and
saw
robinson
salute
peters
but
pass
the
financial
potentate
with
indifference
alas
that
a
reputation
once
built
should
be
destroyed
was
mistook
sir
he
reported
to
grant
later
another
about
but
the
chap
i
met
last
night
they
say
this
other
bloke
is
in
money
hosses
right
soon
be
rolling
in
the
mud
and
have
no
money
put
in
hart
is
he
inquired
grant
carelessly
franklin
from
south
america
grant
and
hart
exchanged
glances
curiously
enough
hart
remained
silent
till
bates
had
gone
must
look
this
joker
up
jack
he
said
then
me
the
mere
mention
of
south
america
is
like
mother
chickens
to
a
sailor
a
harbinger
of
but
hart
consumed
best
brew
to
no
so
far
as
seeing
franklin
was
concerned
since
the
latter
was
in
knoleworth
buying
a
famous
racing
stud
being
in
the
village
however
this
fisher
in
troubled
waters
was
not
inclined
to
return
without
a
bag
of
some
sort
he
walked
straight
into
the
post
office
doris
and
her
father
were
there
the
telegraphist
being
out
day
everybody
he
cried
cheerfully
wants
to
know
martin
if
you
and
miss
doris
will
come
and
dine
with
him
us
this
evening
at
the
postmaster
gazed
helplessly
at
this
stranger
doris
laughed
and
blushed
a
little
is
hart
a
friend
of
dad
she
explained
afraid
we
can
not
accept
the
invitation
we
are
so
worst
of
excuses
said
hart
there
is
a
london
correspondent
here
who
hands
in
a
long
telegram
at
that
his
name
scott
jimmie
peters
here
soon
put
a
stopper
on
him
come
see
if
he
is
it
a
bargain
short
telegram
at
six
dinner
for
five
at
come
now
martin
up
to
you
i
can
see
in
eye
over
the
delectable
i
assure
give
full
details
of
the
peculiar
case
of
a
man
in
worcestershire
whose
crop
of
gooseberries
increased
fourfold
after
starting
an
apiary
and
what
does
it
matter
if
you
do
lose
a
queen
or
two
in
june
the
drones
will
attend
to
that
trifle
a
fixture
eh
peters
in
the
pull
and
push
rout
him
the
whirlwind
subsided
but
quickly
materialized
again
nearly
fell
on
his
knees
and
wept
with
joy
announced
hart
believes
he
was
given
a
bull
steak
for
luncheon
he
pledges
himself
to
have
only
five
hundred
words
on
the
wire
at
five
meanwhile
father
and
daughter
had
decided
that
there
was
no
valid
reason
why
they
should
not
dine
with
grant
martin
already
regretted
his
aloofness
on
the
day
of
the
inquest
though
truth
to
tell
expert
knowledge
of
was
the
determining
factor
on
her
part
doris
was
delighted
her
world
had
gone
awry
that
week
and
this
small
festivity
might
right
it
not
one
word
of
the
improvised
did
hart
confide
to
grant
he
informed
the
only
indispensable
person
bates
and
left
it
at
that
grant
a
restless
being
these
days
took
him
for
another
long
walk
it
chanced
that
their
road
home
led
down
the
the
hour
was
a
quarter
past
seven
and
peters
hailed
them
hart
introduced
the
journalist
saying
casually
is
coming
to
dinner
said
grant
of
course
peters
looked
slightly
surprised
but
passed
no
comment
then
doris
and
her
father
appeared
they
joined
the
others
shook
hands
and
to
secret
perplexity
the
whole
party
moved
off
down
the
hill
in
company
when
the
martins
turned
with
the
rest
to
cross
the
bridge
grant
began
to
suspect
his
friend
he
managed
to
whisper
game
have
you
been
playing
you
satisfied
murmured
hart
as
they
used
to
say
in
the
surrey
theater
as
bad
as
furshaw
there
were
others
far
more
perturbed
by
that
odd
conjunction
of
diners
than
the
puzzled
host
who
merely
expected
bates
to
belabor
him
with
a
rolling
pin
siddle
for
instance
had
just
closed
his
shop
when
the
five
met
that
is
to
say
the
dark
blue
blind
was
drawn
but
the
door
was
ajar
he
came
to
the
threshold
and
watched
the
party
until
the
bridge
was
neared
when
one
of
them
looking
back
might
have
seen
him
so
he
stepped
discreetly
inside
being
a
man
he
seemed
to
be
rather
irresolute
but
that
condition
passed
quickly
leaning
over
the
counter
he
secured
a
hat
and
a
pair
of
and
went
out
he
too
knew
of
weakness
for
shopping
in
knoleworth
and
that
good
lady
had
gone
there
again
her
train
was
due
in
ten
minutes
a
wicket
gate
led
to
a
narrow
passage
communicating
with
the
back
door
of
her
residence
he
entered
boldly
reached
the
garden
and
hurried
to
the
angle
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
next
to
the
strip
of
ground
yes
a
spacious
was
laid
at
doris
martin
and
peters
soon
strolled
out
on
to
the
lawn
the
pedestrians
had
obviously
gone
upstairs
to
wash
after
their
tramp
siddle
rather
forgot
himself
he
stared
so
long
and
earnestly
through
the
that
he
ran
full
tilt
into
jefferson
and
maid
before
regaining
the
but
the
chemist
was
a
ready
man
he
lifted
his
hat
with
an
inquiring
smile
you
say
you
wanted
some
salts
early
in
the
week
he
asked
said
jefferson
i
got
some
in
knoleworth
thank
i
was
just
making
up
an
indent
and
might
as
well
include
your
specific
if
you
really
needed
which
was
kind
and
thoughtful
of
siddle
but
not
quite
true
though
it
fully
explained
his
presence
at
gate
franklin
escorting
a
fragrant
havana
up
the
hill
he
had
traveled
by
the
same
train
saw
the
meeting
and
being
aware
of
frugal
habits
since
furneaux
had
omitted
no
item
of
his
movements
in
steynholme
remembered
it
later
during
the
nightly
gathering
in
the
inn
elkin
greeted
franklin
respectfully
when
the
great
man
joined
the
circle
you
see
anything
worth
while
at
knoleworth
sir
he
said
i
was

the

to

in
my

the
impudence

he
said
shrilly
poor
body
leaves
here
for
some
cemetery
in
london
and
grant
invites
folk
to
a
small
dinner
a
sort
of
awe
fell
on
the
company
none
of
the
others
had
as
yet
put
the
two
events
in
juxtaposition
and
they
had
an
ugly
sound
even
siddle
stifled
a
protest
elkin
had
scored
a
hit
a
palpable
hit
and
no
one
could
gainsay
him
he
felt
that
for
once
the
general
opinion
was
with
him
and
drove
the
point
home
local
joiner
and
explained
for
this
morning
to
borrow
a
couple
of
horses
for
the
job
to
be
done
in
expense
was
the
poor
thing
is
in
her
coffin
now
while
he
stopped
siddle
coughed
said
enough
elkin
murmured
the
chemist
excitement
is
harmful
you
really
ought
to
be
in
bed
for
the
next
hours
dieting
yourself
carefully
and
taking
mixture
regularly
he
has
changed
it
i
me
not
likely
going
to
kick
up
a
row
what
are
the
police
doing
a
set
of
blooming
old
women
what
they
are
but
stir
up
if
i
have
to
write
to
the
home
said
franklin
smiling
genially
can
not
help
taking
a
certain
interest
in
this
affair
may
i
then
as
a
complete
stranger
to
all
concerned
tell
you
how
this
minor
episode
strikes
me
grant
i
understand
denies
having
seen
or
spoken
to
miss
melhuish
during
the
past
three
years
none
of
the
others
now
in
his
house
had
met
her
at
all
really
if
a
man
may
not
give
a
dinnerparty
in
these
conditions
would
become
a
lost
elkin
was
obviously
seeking
for
some
retort
which
though
forcible
would
not
offend
a
possible
patron
but
siddle
answered
far
more
deftly
than
might
be
looked
for
from
the
contention
sir
is
just
what
the
man
of
the
world
would
hold
he
said
in
this
village
where
we
live
on
neighborly
terms
such
an
incident
would
be
impossible
in
almost
any
other
house
than
franklin
nodded
he
was
convinced
tomlin
hobbs
and
a
local
draper
bore
out
the
reasonable
theory
next
morning
steynholme
was
again
united
in
condemning
grant
while
the
postmaster
and
his
daughter
were
not
wholly
exempted
from
criticism
the
dinner
itself
was
an
altogether
harmless
and
cheery
meal
by
common
consent
not
one
word
was
said
about
the
murder
hart
was
amusing
on
the
question
of
flippant
martin
deemed
him
peters
had
a
wide
store
of
strange
experiences
to
draw
on
while
grant
if
rather
silent
in
deference
to
two
such
brilliant
talkers
found
much
satisfaction
in
regarding
doris
as
a
hostess
the
next
day
being
saturday
or
market
day
the
village
was
busy
at
eleven
there
was
a
somewhat
unnecessary
display
of
nodding
plumes
and
black
horses
at
the
removal
of
the
coffin
to
the
railway
station
for
some
reason
the
funeral
arrangements
had
not
been
bruited
about
until
elkin
made
that
envenomed
attack
on
grant
in
the
hare
and
hounds
the
previous
night
ingerman
had
sent
a
gorgeous
wreath
the
only
one
forthcoming
locally
this
fact
of
course
invited
comment
though
no
whisperer
in
the
crowd
troubled
to
add
that
the
interment
was
only
announced
in
that
newspapers
peters
meeting
franklin
on
the
stairs
of
the
inn
put
a
note
into
his
hand
it
read
you
have
a
chat
with
grant
the
public
mind
is
being
inflamed
against
him
hardly
franklin
meeting
peters
in
the
passage
winked
at
him
and
the
journalist
tortured
his
brains
to
turn
out
some
readable
stuff
which
should
grip
the
million
on
sunday
yet
not
to
be
damaging
to
the
man
whose
hospitality
he
enjoyed
over
night
in
a
word
the
passing
of
adelaide
melhuish
was
exploited
thoroughly
as
an
indictment
of
her
lover
and
the
only
two
in
steynholme
not
aware
of
the
fact
were
grant
himself
and
wally
hart
by
a
singular
coincidence
not
ridiculously
beyond
the
ken
of
a
verger
when
doris
went
to
church
on
sunday
morning
she
found
herself
beside
franklin
at
the
close
of
the
service
the
same
big
man
whom
she
had
noticed
as
a
neighbor
in
the
pew
overtook
her
at
the
post
office
door
he
lifted
his
hat
a
heard
him
say
distinctly
me
for
troubling
you
but
can
you
tell
me
at
what
time
the
mail
closes

left
the

he
realized
the
difficulties
facing
him
in
that
respect

trust
you

you
will
justify
my

you

you
to
meet

him
this
afternoon
at
two
at
the

beyond
the
mill
a
closed
car
will
be
in
waiting
and
we
can
have
half
an
talk
without
anyone
in
steynholme
being
the
wiser
remember
that
this
village
like
the
night
has
a
thousand
eyes
naturally
i
would
not

you
in

that
love

especially
if
it
is
spiced
with
a

intrigue
is
innate
in

heart
indeed
he
was
so
assured
of
the
success
of
his
somewhat
dramatic
move
that
as
he
walked
to
a
rendezvous
arranged
with
superintendent
fowler
on
the
knoleworth

he
reviewed
carefully
certain
arguments
meant
to
secure
assistance
passing
he
smiled
at
the
notion
that
furneaux
would
undoubtedly
have
brought

to
the
conclave
it
was
just
the
sort
of
difficult
situation
in
which
his
colleague
would
have
reveled

the
chief

was
more
solid
more
circumspect

singularly
enough
more
sensitive

the
probable

dust
hitherto
siddle
has
tried
to
repress
him
with
a
transparent
honesty
that
rather
worried
me
on
friday
night
however
siddle
attacked
grant
with
poisoned
arrows
he
did
more
damage
in
two
minutes
than
elkin
could
achieve
in
as
many
showed
very
clearly
that
grant
was
guilty
of
gross
bad
taste
in
inviting
martin
and
his
daughter
to
dinner
that
evening
inclined
to
agree
with
him
if
the
story
has
been
told
fairly
but
that
is
beside
the
main
issue
siddle
aroused
the
sleeping
dogs
of
the
village
and
the
pack
is
in
full
cry
again
grant
seems
to
have
been
popular
here
he
had
almost
recovered
from
the
blow
of
miss
death
by
the
straightforward
speech
he
made
before
the
inquest
but
siddle
threw
him
back
into
the
mud
by
a
few
skillful
words
what
is
record
is
he
a
local
man
think
not
robinson
can
tell
says
he
siddle
is
a
widower
that
argue
long
and
close
must
look
into
it
robinson
has
been
stationed
here
four
years
siddle
is
not
old
but
he
has
been
in
business
in
steynholme
more
years
than
that
pardon
me
sure
i
take
it
that
you
are
really
interested
in
the
history
the
superintendent
was
perplexed
or
he
would
not
have
adopted
his
professional
method
of
questions
with
a
man
from
the
hardly
know
what
interested
in
laughed
winter
kill
the
lady
i
shall
be
slow
to
credit
elkin
with
being
the
scoundrel
he
looks
siddle
and
tomlin
if
you
please
are
regarded
as
starters
in
the
doris
martin
matrimonial
stakes
and
i
think
tomlin
could
ever
murder
anything
but
the
english
it
is
that
bothers
murmured
fowler
he
was
not
an
uneducated
man
but
correctly
pronounced
was
unfamiliar
in
his
ears
change
was
so
marked
went
on
the
detective
gather
that
siddle
is
a
stickler
for
charity
and
fair
dealing
he
abandon
the
role
of
course
it
was
the
sheer
ingenuity
of
his
method
that
caught
my
attention
so
i
simply
catalogue
him
for
miss
martin
promised
to
meet
us
inquired
the
other
feeling
that
he
was
on
the
track
of
but
there
she
is
cried
winter
has
just
heard
the
car
tell
your
chauffeur
to
slow
up
the
road
is
empty
otherwise
by
the
way
you
help
her
in
she
might
be
a
bit
shy
of
me
and
i
want
a
judgment
was
not
at
fault
doris
feeling
a
trifle
uncertain
seeing
that
she
was
about
to
encounter
a
complete
stranger
moreover
she
had
come
a
good
half
mile
from
the
shop
whence
the
cakes
for
tea
were
to
be
procured
at
the
back
door
and
as
a
favor
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
slowing
car
with
a
timid
anxiety
that
betrayed
no
small
degree
of
doubt
as
to
the
outcome
of
this
sunday
afternoon
escapade
she
was
pale
and
nervous
at
that
moment
doris
wished
herself
safe
at
home
again
word
broke
in
the
superintendent
hurriedly
are
you
so
sure
that
grant
is
innocent
winter
sure
of
nothing
with
regard
to
this
case
but
i
have
great
faith
in
flair
for
the
true
scent
it
has
never
failed
fowler
wished
his
companion
would
not
use
such
uncommon
words
however
he
got
out
and
took
off
his
hat
with
a
courteous
sweep
doris
had
to
look
twice
at
him
hitherto
she
had
always
seen
him
in
uniform
winter
smiled
at
the
unmistakable
expression
of
relief
in
her
face
she
was
almost
as
she
took
the
seat
by
his
side
day
winter
she
said
franklin
please
better
become
used
to
my
pseudonym
plenty
of
room
for
your
feet
fowler
it
now
comfy
the
chauffeur
will
bring
us
back
here
in
half
an
hour
miss
martin
will
that
suit
your
convenience
yes
i
am
free
till
nearly
four
we
have
a
guest
to
tea
have
a
bump
of
curiosity
these
days
who
is
it
may
i
ask
siddle
the
local
an
old
friend
i
suppose
have
known
him
seven
years
ever
since
he
came
to
he
is
not
a
native
of
the
place
he
bought
business
a
londoner
i
siddle
is
to
say
gossip
has
it
that
he
was
married
but
his
wife
speak
of
her
is
that
it
one
would
have
thought
that
in
a
house
where
he
is
well
really
know
him
well
no
one
does
i
invited
him
to
tea
at
any
rate
laughed
winter
said
doris
invited
himself
at
least
so
i
gathered
from
well
he
feels
lonely
no
doubt
and
wishes
to
chat
about
recent
strange
events
in
steynholme
and
that
brings
me
to
the
reason
why
i
sought
this
chat
under
such
peculiar
conditions
you
realize
my
handicap
miss
martin
if
i
were
seen
talking
to
you
or
even
entering
your
house
as
apart
from
the
post
office
people
would
begin
to
wonder
you
follow
that
you
yes
doris
did
follow
it
what
she
did
not
follow
was
the
veiled
admiration
in
superintendent
glance
at
the
detective
those
few
inconsequential
questions
had
shed
a
flood
of
light
on
past
and
present
yet
the
informant
was
blissfully
unaware
of
their
real
purport
and
the
way
was
opened
so
deftly
the
purchase
of
a
business
would
almost
certainly
be
negotiated
through
a
local
lawyer
let
him
be
found
and
days
could
be
into
as
the
police
phrase
has
it
the
superintendent
had
the
rare
merit
of
being
candid
with
himself
he
had
no
previous
experience
of
scotland
yard
men
or
methods
and
was
inclined
to
be
skeptical
about
furneaux
but
prompt
use
of
a
chance
opening
and
the
restraint
which
cut
off
the
investigation
before
the
girl
could
suspect
any
ulterior
motive
displayed
a
technique
which
the
sussex
constabulary
had
few
opportunities
of
acquiring
miss
martin
began
winter
ever
you
have
the
misfortune
to
fall
wood
call
in
a
doctor
tell
him
the
facts
eh
consult
him
at
all
if
i
she
smiled
somewhat
in
the
position
of
a
specialist
summoned
to
assist
an
eminent
local
practitioner
in
fowler
a
sort
of
gentle
preliminary
leading
up
to
the
disagreeable
duty
of
putting
some
questions
of
a
personal
nature
what
you
may
answer
will
not
go
beyond
ourselves
i
promise
you
that
you
will
not
be
quoted
or
requested
to
prove
your
statements
such
a
thing
would
be
absurd
if
i
were
really
a
doctor
and
you
needed
my
advice
you
might
easily
describe
your
symptoms
all
wrong
it
would
be
my
business
to
listen
and
deduce
the
truth
and
i
would
never
dream
of
rating
you
for
having
misled
me
you
see
my
point
but
franklin
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
the
sure
you
it
was
a
wicked
trick
of
fate
that
took
you
to
garden
last
monday
was
really
an
astronomical
almanac
retorted
doris
who
now
felt
a
growing
confidence
in
this
official
is
a
star
remarkable
for
its
beautiful
changing
lights
and
on
monday
evening
was
at
its
best
i
think
i
ought
to
explain
and
she
blushed
delightfully
the
village
gossip
about
grant
and
me
is
entirely
mistaken
we
are
i
had
better
use
plain
are
not
lovers
my
father
and
i
are
just
on
close
friendly
terms
with
grant
position
hardly
warrants
even
that
relationship
with
an
author
of
some
distinction
but
please
set
aside
any
notion
of
us
as
likely
to
become
engaged
for
one
thing
it
is
preposterous
for
another
i
shall
not
leave
my
poor
doris
she
little
guessed
how
accurately
this
skilled
student
of
human
nature
read
the
hidden
thought
behind
that
vehement
protest
even
the
note
of
vague
rebellion
against
social
disabilities
was
pathetic
yet
illuminating
of
course
he
took
her
quite
seriously
us
keep
to
the
hard
road
of
fact
he
said
you
really
mean
is
that
grant
has
never
made
love
to
you
but
i
must
be
candid
young
lady
there
is
no
earthly
reason
why
he
though
i
could
name
offhand
half
a
dozen
why
he
should
well
well
i
must
not
pay
compliments
my
friend
furneaux
can
manage
that
with
much
greater
facility
being
half
a
frenchman
and
now
going
to
say
an
unpleasant
thing
i
ask
your
forgiveness
in
advance
both
furneaux
and
i
agree
in
the
opinion
that
your
imaginary
love
affair
is
indissolubly
bound
up
with
the
mystery
of
miss
death
in
a
word
i
have
brought
you
here
today
to
discuss
your
prospective
marriage
and
nothing
else
that
astonishes
you
eh
well
the
truth
as
i
shall
proceed
to
make
clear
a
fred
elkin
for
doris
uttered
a
little
laugh
of
dismay
emphatic
words
had
astounded
her
but
the
name
acted
as
comic
relief
bear
the
man
she
protested
have
no
doubt
but
you
ought
to
know
that
he
is
loudly
proclaiming
his
determination
to
marry
you
before
the
year
is
the
face
reddened
again
and
her
eyes
sparkled
marry
him
if
he
were
a
peer
of
the
realm
she
said
indignantly
so
but
he
is
an
avowed
suitor
now
be
vexed
has
he
never
declared
his
intentions
to
would
never
dare
i
sing
and
act
a
little
at
village
concerts
and
dramatic
performances
and
he
has
annoyed
me
at
times
by
an
officious
pretense
that
he
was
deputed
by
my
father
to
see
me
home
i
came
here
quite
a
little
girl
so
people
learnt
to
use
my
christian
name
i
object
to
it
at
all
but
i
simply
hate
hearing
it
on
fred
said
winter
solemnly
doris
after
a
period
of
calm
was
now
profoundly
uncomfortable
this
kind
of
prying
was
the
last
thing
she
had
expected
she
had
come
prepared
to
defend
grant
but
beyond
one
exceedingly
personal
reference
the
detective
had
studiously
shut
him
out
of
the
conversation
am
i
to
say
she
cried
you
want
a
list
of
all
the
young
men
who
make
eyes
at
me
i
can
get
that
from
the
census
bureau
come
now
miss
martin
know
has
any
man
in
the
village
led
you
to
suspect
shall
we
put
it
that
sometime
or
other
he
might
ask
you
to
become
his
wife
lo
and
behold
pretty
eyes
filled
with
tears
superintendent
fowler
was
so
pleased
at
hearing
scotland
yard
introducing
a
parenthetical
query
into
its
sentences
that
he
sitting
opposite
was
taken
aback
when
winter
said
in
a
fatherly
way
been
rather
clumsy
afraid
but
it
can
not
be
helped
i
must
go
blundering
on
groping
in
the
dark
you
know
but
a
thousand
pities
i
shall
have
to
tread
on
that
sobbed
doris
hate
to
put
my
thoughts
into
words
all
there
a
man
whom
she
turned
on
winter
a
face
of
sudden
awe
can
you
possibly
guess
she
said
wonderingly
and
sheer
bewilderment
dried
her
tears
business
is
guesswork
at
any
rate
we
are
on
firm
ground
now
if
you
could
please
yourself
i
suppose
siddle
would
not
come
to
tea
certainly
would
not
declared
the
girl
emphatically
believe
he
is
coming
for
a
purpose
must
drag
him
in
again
for
an
that
the
commotion
aroused
in
the
village
by
this
murder
would
incline
you
favorably
to
a
proposal
of
marriage
siddle
may
have
discovered
some
virtue
in
the
elkin
really
hint
that
i
needed
as
a
shield
doris
was
genuinely
angry
now
she
little
imagined
that
winter
was
playing
on
her
emotions
with
a
master
hand
waste
any
wrath
on
elkin
he
soothed
her
fellow
worth
it
but
his
crude
idea
might
be
developed
more
subtly
by
an
abler
think
it
odd
that
siddle
should
choose
of
all
days
for
a
visit
she
admitted
winter
relapsed
into
silence
for
a
while
the
car
was
running
through
a
charming
countryside
and
a
glimpse
of
the
sea
was
obtainable
from
the
crest
of
each
hill
fowler
was
too
circumspect
to
break
in
on
the
thread
of
his
thoughts
the
inquiry
had
taken
a
curious
turn
and
was
momentarily
beyond
his
grasp
singular
but
true
said
the
detective
musingly
when
next
he
spoke
i
am
now
going
to
ask
you
to
act
differently
than
was
in
my
mind
when
i
sought
this
interview
i
should
vastly
like
to
be
present
when
siddle
bares
his
heart
to
you
this
afternoon
can
invite
you
to
that
serve
our
ends
but
if
you
feel
you
have
a
purpose
you
will
be
nerved
to
deal
with
him
bring
him
out
into
that
secluded
garden
of
first
thing
he
will
suggest
and
voice
waxed
unconsciously
bitter
knows
that
dad
will
be
busy
with
the
mails
for
an
hour
after
think
it
bad
most
find
the
position
so
awkward
if
you
are
playing
a
part
and
that
is
what
i
bit
of
clever
acting
lean
on
those
railings
and
make
siddle
believe
that
your
heart
is
on
lawn
you
know
the
kind
of
thing
i
mean
dreamy
eyes
listless
manner
inattention
with
smiling
apologies
you
will
annoy
siddle
and
a
cautious
man
in
a
temper
becomes
less
cautious
force
him
to
avow
his
real
thoughts
you
will
learn
something
trust
what
there
were
no
tears
in
eyes
they
were
wide
open
in
wonderment
his
attitude
to
this
tragedy
do
this
and
you
will
be
giving
grant
the
greatest
possible
help
he
needs
it
next
wednesday
at
the
adjourned
inquest
he
will
be
put
on
the
rack
ingerman
will
fee
counsel
to
be
vindictive
merciless
such
men
are
to
be
hired
their
reputation
is
built
up
on
the
slaughter
of
reputations
i
want
to
understand
siddle
before
wednesday
by
the
way
his
other
name
siddle
unusual
well
your
half
hour
is
nearly
up
will
you
do
what
i
ask
try
may
i
put
one
question
said
you
had
something
altogether
different
in
view
before
we
met
what
was
it
tell
me
tell
you
on
not
now
it
is
the
hardest
thing
in
the
world
for
a
woman
to
be
in
the
limited
sense
of
concentration
i
mean
focus
your
wits
on
siddle
i
suggest
any
plan
i
leave
that
to
your
own
intelligence
vex
him
and
let
him
him
what
man
get
mad
if
he
notices
that
his
best
girl
is
thinking
about
a
this
time
doris
did
not
blush
she
was
troubled
and
serious
very
serious
do
what
i
can
she
promised
shall
i
see
you
again
no
hurry
all
this
is
preparatory
for
i
to
tell
my
father
nothing
yourself
not
at
present
i
recommend
the
car
had
stopped
it
sped
on
when
doris
alighted
she
would
be
home
with
her
cakes
at
three
and
martin
would
never
have
noticed
her
absence
fine
bit
of
work
if
i
may
say
so
exclaimed
fowler
appreciatively
i
am
jiggered
if
i
can
imagine
what
driving
winter
was
cutting
the
end
off
a
big
cigar
he
finished
the
operation
to
his
liking
before
answering
earnestly
stand
or
fall
by
the
result
of
that
efforts
furneaux
thinks
so
and
i
agree
with
him
absolutely
after
five
days
where
are
we
fowler
in
the
dark
plus
a
hat
and
hair
but
a
queer
belief
in
some
parts
of
england
that
a
phosphorescent
gleam
shows
at
night
over
a
deep
pool
in
which
a
dead
body
lies
just
how
i
feel
about
siddle
the
an
enigma
what
sort
of
place
is
steynholme
for
a
chemist
of
his
capacities
foxton
has
the
highest
regard
for
him
professionally
and
told
he
doctors
people
for
miles
around
yet
he
lives
the
life
of
a
recluse
an
old
woman
comes
by
day
to
prepare
his
meals
and
tidy
the
house
and
shop
his
sole
relaxation
is
an
hour
of
an
evening
in
the
village
inn
his
visits
there
being
uninterrupted
since
the
murder
he
was
there
on
the
night
of
the
murder
too
for
the
rest
he
is
alone
shut
off
from
the
world
without
knowing
it
going
to
fall
into
deep
waters
and
emit
sparks
or
a
chinaman
leave
you
here
see
you
on
tuesday
after
the
superintendent
drove
on
alone
he
pondered
the
steynholme
affair
in
all
its
bearings
but
mostly
did
he
weigh
up
winter
and
furneaux
at
last
he
sighed
ways
and
london
books
and
london
detectives
he
muttered
not
up
to
date
in
sussex
now
if
i
could
please
myself
be
after
elkin
i
see
what
winter
has
in
his
mind
but

what
doris
was
lucky
she
met
siddle
as
she
emerged
from
the
back
passage
to
the
resolving
instantly
that
if
an
unpleasant
thing
had
to
be
done
it
should
at
least
be
done
well
she
smiled
brightly
what
you
have
driven
me
the
sabbath
she
cried
holding
up
the
bag
of
cakes
and
with
you
would
be
a
feast

far
arrived
in
the
house
she
found
her
father
still
in
the
garden
examining
some
larvae
under
a
microscope
he
looked

than
studious

omnipotent

its

felon
being
regarded
in
that
way
by
the
providence
which
for
some
inscrutable
purpose
permitted
yet
would
infallibly
punish
a
dreadful
murder
she
was
a
girl
of
devout
mind
and
the
notion
was
appalling
in
its
direct
application
to
current
events
in
the
meantime
the
chemist
evidently
taking
a
sunday
afternoon
constitutional
came
on
winter
who
was
leaning
on
a
wall
of
the
bridge
and
looking
down
house
being
on
the
left
he
would
have
passed
in
his
wonted
unobtrusive
way
but
the
detective
hailed
him
with
a
cheery
day
siddle
are
you
a
fisherman
franklin
not
he
answered
now
surprised
you
are
just
the
sort
of
man
whom
i
should
expect
to
find
attached
to
a
rod
and

i
was
younger

i
could
neither
impale

nor

my
gorge
rose
against
either
practice
i
am
a
vegetarian
for
the
same
reason
if
it
were
not
for
this
disturbing
tragedy
you
would
have
heard
hobbs
the
butcher
rallying
me
about
my

he
calls
my
well
laughed

and
mine

in

look
on

after
it

have
three

i
could
show
a

stretch

chapter

on
both
sides
of
the
river
the
sun
transmuted
into
greenwich
time
exercised
an
extraordinary
influence
on
the
seemingly
humdrum
life
of
steynholme
that
day
a
few
minutes
after
three
too
late
to
observe
either
winter
or
robinson
strolled
forth
from
his
cottage
he
glanced
up
the
almost
deserted
in
which
every
rounded
cobble
and
white
flagstone
radiated
heat
a
automobile
had
dashed
past
twice
in
forty
minutes
but
the
pace
was
on
the
borderland
of
doubt
so
the
guardian
of
the
public
weal
had
contented
himself
with
recording
its
number
on
the
return
journey
but
his
thoughts
were
far
from
joyriders
stray
cattle
hawkers
without
licenses
and
other
similar
small
fry
which
come
into
the
constabulary
net
it
would
be
a
feather
in
his
cap
if
he
could
only
strike
the
trail
of
the
veritable
steynholme
murderer
the
entrancing
notion
possessed
him
morning
noon
and
night
robinson
declared
that
it
even
dominated
his
dreams
robinson
was
sharp
he
knew
quite
well
that
the
brains
of
the
london
detectives
held
some
elusive
quality
which
he
personally
lacked
they
seemed
to
peer
into
the
heart
of
a
thing
so
wisely
and
thoroughly
he
did
not
share
superintendent
somewhat
derogatory
estimate
of
furneaux
with
whom
he
was
much
better
acquainted
than
was
his
superior
officer
while
chief
inspector
repute
stood
so
high
that
it
might
not
be
questioned
still
to
the
best
of
his
belief
the
case
had
beaten
both
these
doughty
representatives
of
scotland
yard
there
was
yet
a
chance
for
the
humble
so
robinson
squared
his
shoulders
seamed
his
brows
and
marched
majestically
down
the
knoleworth
road
he
had
an
eye
for
of
course
though
neither
he
nor
anybody
else
could
discern
more
than
the
bare
edge
of
the
lawn
from
bridge
or
road
owing
to
the
dense
screen
of
evergreen
trees
and
shrubs
planted
by
the
tenant
who
remodeled
the
property
but
the
spot
where
the
body
of
adelaide
melhuish
was
drawn
ashore
was
visible
and
the
sight
of
it
started
a
dim
thesis
in
the
mind
which
took
definite
shape
during
less
than
an
stroll
thus
at
four
exactly
he
was
pulling
the
bell
at
almost
simultaneously
siddle
knocked
modestly
on
the
private
door
of
the
post
office
to
reach
which
one
had
to
pass
down
a
narrow
yard
grant
at
home
inquired
robinson
when
minnie
appeared
yes
the
master
was
on
the
lawn
with
hart
the
policeman
found
the
two
there
seated
in
chairs
with
awnings
they
had
been
discussing
of
all
things
in
the
world
the
futurist
craze
in
painting
hart
held
by
it
but
grant
carried
bigger
guns
in
real
knowledge
of
the
limitations
as
well
as
his
privileges
hart
was
the
first
to
notice
the
presence
and
greeted
him
joyously
along
robinson
and
manacle
this
reprobate
he
shouted
nothing
but
a
a
period
in
prison
will
dust
the
cobwebs
out
of
his
robinson
said
grant
stirring
much
sir
i
just
popped
in
to
ask
if
you
remembered
exactly
how
the
body
was
roped
i
do
not
some
incidents
of
that
horrible
half
hour
have
gone
into
a
sad
jumble
i
recollect
you
calling
attention
to
the
matter
but
what
your
point
was
i
really
can
not
say
now
perhaps
it
may
come
back
if
you
we
seem
to
be
making
a
great
deal
of
progress
sir
and
i
was
wondering
whether
you
two
gentlemen
might
help
i
want
it
mentioned
taking
a
line
of
me
grant
repressed
a
smile
he
recalled
well
enough
the
first
the
policeman
took
and
the
mischief
it
had
caused
being
an
person
however
he
admitted
that
his
own
behavior
had
not
been
above
suspicion
on
the
day
the
crime
was
discovered
in
allotting
blame
as
between
robinson
and
himself
the
proportion
was
six
of
one
and
half
a
dozen
of
the
other
justiciary
said
hart
started
well
anyhow
the
connection
between
a
line
and
a
rope
should
be
obvious
even
to
a
judge
as
a
have
a
drink
robinson
had
removed
his
helmet
and
was
flourishing
a
red
handkerchief
not
without
cause
the
day
being
really
very
hot
for
a
few
minutes
thank
you
sir
said
the
policeman
i
ask
bates
for
a
sack
and
a
cord
he
went
to
the
kitchen
hart
was
to
death
he
vowed
are
about
to
witness
the
reconstruction
of
the
crime
a
procedure
which
the
french
delight
in
and
the
intellect
of
france
is
a
hundred
years
ahead
of
our
effete
civilization
he
chortled
grant
was
not
so
pleased
the
memory
of
a
distressing
vision
was
beginning
to
blur
and
this
ponderous
policeman
must
come
and
revive
it
yet
even
he
grew
interested
when
robinson
illustrated
a
nebulous
idea
by
knotting
a
clothesline
around
a
sack
stuffed
with
straw
having
brought
bates
to
bear
him
out
in
the
matter
of
accuracy
you
are
gentlemen
he
said
puffing
after
the
slight
exertion
the
way
of
it
how
does
it
strike
you
what
a
sailor
calls
two
half
hitches
commented
hart
instantly
very
serviceable
knot
which
will
resist
to
the
full
strength
of
the
have
no
sailors
in
steynholme
sir
said
the
policeman
used
regularly
by
tradesmen
put
in
grant
draper
or
man
accustomed
to
tying
parcels
securely
in
fashion
that
knot
nine
times
out
of
about
farmer
sir
that
was
as
near
as
robinson
dared
to
go
to
think
a
farmer
would
be
more
likely
to
adopt
a
timber
hitch
which
is
made
in
several
ways
here
are
and
grant
busied
himself
with
rope
and
sack
robinson
watched
closely
he
nodded
seen
those
knots
in
a
farmyard
well
a
trifle
better
than
nothing
all
right
bates
you
can
take
you
shown
that
knot
to
furneaux
inquired
grant
sir
kept
that
up
me
sleeve
as
the
why
robinson
shuffled
uneasily
on
his
feet
scotland
yard
men
will
hardly
listen
to
a
uniformed
constable
sir
he
said
tell
all
about
it
at
the
inquest
on
effect
john
robinson
he
sez
they
know
down
in
judee
quoted
hart
got
my
name
pat
grinned
the
policeman
whose
christian
names
were
name
is
walter
not
patrick
retorted
hart
robinson
continued
to
smile
though
he
failed
to
grasp
the
joke
until
late
that
evening
you
make
up
that
verse
straight
off
sir
he
asked
a
borrowed
plume
plucked
from
an
american
quill
hart
gave
a
french
sound
and
robinson
was
puzzled
to
know
why
grant
bade
his
friend
stop
profaning
a
peaceful
sunday
afternoon
have
a
glass
of
beer
now
went
on
the
host
mind
if
i
do
sir
though
and
i
make
it
a
rule
on
sundays
to
have
tea
with
the
missis
a
hours
are
broken
up
and
his
wife
hardly
ever
knows
when
to
have
a
meal
minnie
was
summoned
it
took
her
a
couple
of
minutes
to
draw
the
beer
from
a
cool
cellar
so
it
chanced
that
when
doris
led
siddle
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
about
minutes
past
four
the
first
thing
they
saw
was
the
local
on
the
lawn
of
putting
down
a
gill
of
at
a
draught
cried
the
chemist
icily
wonder
what
superintendent
fowler
would
say
to
that
if
he
knew
it
is
there
particularly
wrong
about
robinson
drinking
a
glass
of
beer
demanded
doris
more
alive
to
the
insinuation
in
words
than
was
quite
permissible
under
the
role
imposed
on
her
by
winter
she
waved
her
hand
to
the
party
on
the
lawn
grant
whose
eyes
ever
roved
in
that
direction
had
seen
her
white
muslin
dress
the
moment
she
appeared
the
deuce
is
that
with
miss
martin
he
said
returning
her
signal
the
chemist
announced
robinson
not
too
well
pleased
himself
at
being
so
openly
gentlemen
be
off
and
he
vanished
by
the
side
path
through
the
laurels
repeated
grant
vexedly
it
is
and
she
dislikes
the
man
for
some
go
and
rescue
the
fair
maid
prompted
hart
no
if
doris
wanted
me
she
would
let
me
at
the
top
of
her
voice
far
too
curious
of
course
drawled
hart
are
you
going
to
marry
the
girl
jack
soon
as
this
infernal
business
has
blown
asked
her
i
gather
me
when
you
do
and
hie
me
to
london
town
though
in
torrid
june
unbearable
in
lash
of
your
wit
cuts
deeply
sometimes
said
grant
quietly
it
all
old
chap
i
was
talking
at
random
very
well
do
penance
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
by
remaining
here
and
applauding
your
poetic
efforts
even
help
a
dab
at
meanwhile
siddle
had
regained
his
poise
meant
nothing
offensive
to
the
donor
of
the
beer
he
said
tuning
his
voice
to
an
apologetic
note
i
take
it
robinson
is
conducting
certain
inquiries
and
i
imagine
that
his
superiors
demand
a
degree
of
circumspection
in
such
conditions
that
is
you
do
not
rank
with
the
stupid
crowd
in
its
suspicions
of
grant
said
the
girl
pleased
to
think
you
refuse
to
class
me
with
the
of
steynholme
doris
was
the
guarded
answer
there
had
been
no
reference
to
the
murder
during
tea
which
was
served
as
soon
as
the
chemist
came
in
the
visitor
had
tabled
a
copy
of
a
current
medical
journal
containing
an
article
on
the
therapeutic
qualities
of
honey
so
the
talk
was
lifted
at
once
into
an
atmosphere
far
removed
from
crime
doris
was
grateful
for
his
tact
when
her
father
went
to
the
office
she
brought
siddle
into
the
garden
solely
in
pursuance
of
her
promise
to
the
detective
though
convinced
that
there
would
be
no
outcome
save
a
few
labored
compliments
to
herself
and
now
by
accident
as
it
were
the
death
of
adelaide
melhuish
thrust
itself
into
their
conversation
perhaps
it
was
her
fault
she
said
candidly
one
who
has
known
you
for
seven
years
siddle
could
possibly
accuse
you
of
spreading
years
is
it
so
long
since
i
came
to
steynholme
sometimes
it
appears
an
age
but
more
often
i
fancy
the
calendar
must
be
in
error
why
it
seems
only
the
other
day
that
i
saw
you
in
a
short
frock
bowling
a
occupation
laughed
doris
dad
encouraged
that
and
skipping
as
the
best
possible
means
of
was
right
look
how
straight
and
svelte
you
are
few
if
any
among
our
community
can
have
watched
your
progress
to
womanhood
as
closely
as
i
you
see
living
opposite
as
i
do
i
kept
track
of
you
more
intimately
than
your
other
siddle
was
trimming
his
sails
cleverly
the
concluding
sentence
robbed
his
earlier
comments
of
their
sentimental
import
we
live
long
enough
we
may
even
see
each
other
in
the
sere
and
yellow
leaf
said
doris
flippantly
would
ask
no
greater
happiness
came
the
quiet
reply
and
doris
could
have
bitten
her
tongue
for
according
him
that
unguarded
opening
suddenly
availing
herself
of
the
advice
which
the
detective
like
hamlet
had
given
to
the
players
she
gazed
musingly
at
the
fair
panorama
of
the
hollies
and
its
gardens
with
the
two
young
men
seated
on
the
lawn
by
this
time
minnie
was
staging
tea
and
the
picture
looked
idyllic
enough
doris
saw
out
of
the
tail
of
her
eye
that
her
companion
was
watching
her
furtively
though
apparently
absorbed
in
the
scene
he
moistened
his
thin
lips
with
his
tongue
a
study
in
contrasts
that
would
be
hard
to
beat
he
said
after
a
long
pause
she
echoed
yes
even
an
uncontentious
man
like
myself
can
hardly
fail
to
compare
sunday
afternoon
with
tuesday
not
monday
night
she
flashed
night
in
part
remains
a
mystery
yet
to
be
unveiled
i
blot
monday
night
from
my
mind
i
have
no
alternative
being
on
the
jury
which
has
to
arrive
at
a
just
verdict
now
if
fred
elkin
were
here
he
would
foam
at
the
fred
elkin
is
i
am
glad
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
you
like
him
detest
makes
out
to
put
it
mildly
that
you
are
great
will
oblige
me
by
contradicting
the
statement
one
treats
that
sort
of
man
with
agree
with
you
most
heartily
sorry
i
ever
mentioned
yet
doris
was
well
aware
that
the
chemist
had
dragged
in
elkin
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
probably
for
the
sake
of
getting
him
disposed
of
thoroughly
and
for
all
time
rather
on
the
tiptoe
of
expectation
she
awaited
the
next
move
it
was
slow
in
coming
so
again
she
looked
wistfully
at
the
distant
she
found
slight
difficulty
in
carrying
out
this
portion
of
the
stage
directions
truth
to
tell
she
would
gleefully
have
gone
and
joined
them
siddle
was
not
altogether
at
ease
the
conversation
was
too
spasmodic
to
suit
his
purpose
though
slow
of
speech
he
was
nimble
of
brain
and
knowing
doris
so
well
he
had
anticipated
a
livelier
duel
of
wits
in
all
likelihood
he
cursed
the
on
the
lawn
he
had
not
foreseen
this
drawback
but
being
a
masterful
man
he
tackled
the
situation
boldly
seized
the
opportunity
of
a
friendly
chat
with
you
doris
he
went
on
leaning
over
the
fence
to
inhale
the
scent
of
a
briar
rose
story
runs
through
the
village
that
you
and
your
father
dined
at
the
hollies
on
friday
evening
is
that
true
now
doris
had
it
on
reliable
authority
that
siddle
himself
had
been
the
runner
who
spread
that
story
and
the
knowledge
steeled
her
heart
against
him
she
said
composedly
was
kind
and
neighborly
of
you
to
accept
the
invitation
but
a
she
turned
and
faced
him
his
expression
was
baffling
she
thought
she
saw
in
his
sallow
features
the
shadow
of
a
confident
smile
mean
that
this
horrid
murder
should
make
some
difference
in
the
friendship
between
ourselves
and
grant
she
cried
to
you
though
to
no
one
else
would
i
speak
so
plainly
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
grant
is
far
very
far
from
being
clear
of
responsibility
in
that
matter
three
days
from
now
you
will
understand
what
i
mean
evidence
will
be
forthcoming
which
will
put
him
in
a
most
unenviable
light
i
am
not
alleging
or
even
hinting
that
he
may
be
deemed
guilty
of
actual
crime
that
is
for
the
law
to
determine
but
i
do
tell
you
emphatically
that
his
present
heedless
attitude
will
give
place
to
anxiety
and
dejection
it
can
not
be
otherwise
a
somewhat
sordid
history
will
be
revealed
and
his
pretense
that
relations
between
him
and
the
dead
woman
ceased
three
years
ago
will
vanish
into
thin
air
believe
me
doris
i
am
actuated
by
no
motive
in
this
matter
other
than
a
desire
to
further
your
welfare
i
can
not
bear
even
to
think
of
your
name
being
associated
in
ever
so
small
degree
with
that
of
a
man
who
must
be
hounded
out
of
his
own
social
circle
if
no
worse
fate
is
in
store
for
gracious
cried
doris
genuinely
amazed
do
you
come
to
know
all
this
listen
to
the
words
of
those
qualified
to
speak
with
knowledge
and
authority
i
have
mixed
in
varied
company
this
past
week
wholly
on
your
account
be
led
away
by
the
mere
formalities
of
the
opening
day
of
the
inquest
the
coroner
deliberately
shut
off
all
real
evidence
except
as
to
the
cause
of
death
on
wednesday
the
situation
will
change
and
you
can
not
fail
to
be
shocked
by
what
you
hear
because
you
will
be
am
given
to
understand
that
even
if
i
am
called
my
testimony
will
be
of
no
may
be
the
police
view
ingerman
will
press
for
a
very
different
he
told
you
that
although
foreman
of
the
jury
you
have
not
declined
to
hobnob
with
a
man
who
is
avowedly
enemy
would
hobnob
with
worse
people
if
by
so
doing
i
might
serve
grant
up
as
he
put
it
to
hart
with
watching
the
à
between
doris
and
the
chemist
sprang
to
his
feet
and
went
through
a
pantomime
easy
enough
to
follow
save
for
one
or
two
signs
doris
held
both
hands
aloft
well
knowing
that
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
code
would
be
gall
and
wormwood
to
siddle
she
explained
laughingly
grant
signals
that
he
and
hart
are
going
for
a
walk
he
wants
me
to
accompany
them
but
i
unfortunately
i
promised
dad
to
help
with
the
you
really
mean
what
you
say
my
warning
would
seem
to
have
fallen
on
deaf
voice
was
well
under
control
but
his
eyes
glinted
dangerously
his
state
was
that
of
a
man
torn
by
passion
who
nevertheless
felt
that
any
display
of
the
rage
possessing
him
would
be
fatal
to
his
cause
but
rather
unexpectedly
doris
took
fire
innuendoes
and
protestations
were
sufficiently
hard
to
bear
without
the
added
knowledge
that
a
ridiculous
convention
denied
her
the
companionship
of
a
man
whom
she
loved
and
who
she
was
beginning
to
believe
loved
her
she
swept
round
on
siddle
like
a
wrathful
goddess
have
borne
with
you
patiently
because
of
the
acquaintance
of
years
but
i
shall
be
glad
if
this
of
malice
and
ignorance
now
ceases
she
said
proudly
grant
is
my
friend
and
my
friend
in
the
first
horror
of
the
crime
which
has
besmirched
our
dear
little
village
we
both
treated
grant
rather
badly
we
know
better
your
ingermans
and
your
elkins
and
the
rest
of
the
busybodies
gathered
at
the
inn
may
defame
him
as
they
choose
or
as
they
dare
as
for
me
i
am
his
loyal
comrade
and
shall
remain
so
after
next
wednesday
or
a
score
of
wednesdays
i
am
going
in
now
siddle
and
shall
be
engaged
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
your
shop
opens
at
six
and
i
am
sure
you
will
find
some
more
profitable
means
of
spending
the
time
than
in
telling
me
things
i
would
rather
not
siddle
caught
her
arm
he
said
fiercely
must
not
leave
me
without
at
least
learning
my
true
motive
the
girl
wrested
herself
free
from
his
grip
she
realized
what
was
coming
and
forestalled
it
care
nothing
for
your
motive
she
cried
forget
yourself
please
go
she
literally
ran
into
the
house
the
chemist
unless
he
elected
to
behave
like
a
fool
had
no
option
but
to
follow
and
make
his
way
to
the
street
by
the
side
door
the
only
other
happening
of
significance
that
sunday
was
an
unheralded
visit
by
winter
to
the
residence
he
popped
in
after
dusk
opening
the
door
without
knocking
in
robinson
he
inquired
sir
will
detain
you
more
than
a
minute
at
the
inquest
you
said
that
you
personally
untied
the
rope
which
bound
miss
body
here
are
a
piece
of
string
and
a
newspaper
would
you
mind
showing
me
what
sort
of
knot
was
used
robinson
was
nearly
struck
dumb
and
his
fingers
fumbled
badly
but
he
managed
to
exhibit
two
hitches
thanks
said
winter
and
was
off
in
a
jiffy
from
the
window
of
a
darkened
room
robinson
watched
the
erect
burly
figure
of
the
detective
until
it
was
merged
in
the
mists
of
night
he
exclaimed
bitterly
what
are
you
swearing
about
demanded
his
wife
from
the
kitchen
i
heard
answered
her
husband
was
a
chap
of
my
name
john
robinson
he
said
that
down
in
judee
they
know
everything
and
by
gum
he
was
right
they
knew
mighty
little
about
london
thinking
but
hold
on
he
bustled
into
his
coat
and
hastened
to
no
neither
grant
nor
hart
had
spoken
to
a
soul
about
the
knot
nor
had
bates
of
course
robinson
did
not
venture
to
describe
winter
finally
he
put
the
incident
aside
as
a
clear
case
of
chapter
xv
a
matter
of
heredity
shortly
before
noon
on
monday
occurred
two
events
destined
to
assume
a
paramount
importance
in
the
affair
which
was
wringing
the
withers
of
steynholme
as
in
the
histories
of
both
men
and
nations
these
first
steps
in
great
developments
began
quietly
enough
for
one
thing
furneaux
returned
to
the
village
for
another
the
london
telegraphist
who
expected
the
day
to
prove
practically
a
blank
was
reading
a
newspaper
when
the
telegraph
instrument
clicked
the
local
call
doris
was
checking
and
distributing
the
stock
of
stamps
which
had
arrived
that
morning
her
father
was
counting
in
a
small
annex
to
the
main
room
the
knoleworth
office
having
acquired
a
habit
of
making
up
shortages
by
docking
the
country
branches
no
member
of
the
public
happened
to
be
present
the
girl
could
have
heard
what
the
morse
code
was
tapping
forth
had
she
chosen
but
she
had
trained
herself
to
disregard
the
telegraph
when
occupied
on
other
work
suddenly
however
the
pencil
paused
he
said
siddle
the
chemist
opposite
it
said
doris
suspending
her
calculations
at
mention
of
the
name
his
she
echoed
vacantly
somehow
it
had
never
hitherto
dawned
on
her
that
the
chemist
might
possess
relatives
in
some
part
of
the
country
what
it
says
went
on
the
other
inform
you
your
mother
died
this
morning
superintendent
horton
an
asylum
too
said
the
girl
speaking
at
random
horton
is
the
place
for
epileptic
lunatics
near
epsom
you
know
does
it
mean
she
was
an
epileptic
lunatic
i
should
imagine
from
the
wording
if
a
nurse
or
a
matron
surely
describe
her
as
suppose
we
ought
not
to
discuss
telegram
said
doris
after
a
pause
no
but
the
harm
i
have
yelled
out
the
news
if
we
three
alone
that
boy
to
his
dinner
father
will
take
it
by
the
way
say
nothing
to
him
as
to
the
contents
would
you
mind
calling
him
doris
hurried
swiftly
to
the
and
thence
upstairs
the
telegraphist
explained
the
absence
of
a
messenger
so
martin
delivered
the
telegram
in
person
crossing
the
street
he
detected
a
dead
bee
he
picked
it
up
horrified
at
the
thought
that
the
isle
of
wight
disease
might
have
reached
sussex
so
it
was
an
postmaster
who
handed
the
telegram
over
counter
inquiring
laconically
there
any
answer
siddle
opened
the
buff
envelope
and
read
he
glanced
sharply
at
martin
he
said
wrong
with
that
bee
know
i
have
my
doubts
when
i
have
a
moment
to
spare
put
it
under
the
siddle
examined
the
telegram
again
the
handwriting
was
that
beloved
of
civil
service
commissioners
unquestionably
it
was
not
no
sooner
had
his
friend
gone
off
still
intent
on
the
dead
insect
than
siddle
followed
he
knew
that
the
bee
would
undergo
scientific
scrutiny
at
once
so
gave
martin
just
enough
time
to
dive
into
the
before
entering
the
post
office
you
receive
this
telegram
a
few
minutes
ago
he
inquired
the
young
man
became
severely
official
telegram
he
said
stiffly
one
and
siddle
gave
him
the
written
message
was
the
answer
me
its
contents
known
to
you
only
do
you
mean
sir
it
would
cost
me
my
berth
if
i
divulged
a
word
of
it
to
sorry
pray
take
offense
anxious
that
my
friends
and
miss
martin
should
not
hear
of
it
that
is
what
i
really
have
in
the
telegraphist
cooled
down
may
be
quite
sure
that
neither
they
nor
any
other
person
in
steynholme
will
ever
see
the
duplicate
he
said
confidentially
make
up
a
package
containing
duplicates
each
evening
and
it
is
sent
to
headquarters
if
it
will
please
you
lock
the
copy
now
in
my
is
exceedingly
good
of
you
said
siddle
gratefully
as
a
londoner
will
understand
that
such
a
telegram
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
one
would
like
to
become
known
even
in
the
most
limited
can
depend
on
me
siddle
hastened
back
to
his
shop
the
telegraphist
looked
after
him
he
mused
doris
guessed
him
at
once
i
must
be
careful
this
village
contains
doris
watching
from
an
upper
room
saw
the
visitor
and
timed
him
she
imagined
he
had
dispatched
an
answer
being
a
woman
she
sought
enlightenment
a
few
minutes
later
siddle
came
in
she
said
tentatively
said
the
specialist
smiling
i
agree
with
you
miss
martin
we
talk
about
telegrams
even
among
ourselves
unless
it
is
necessary
doris
was
silenced
but
she
read
the
riddle
correctly
the
chemist
was
particularly
anxious
that
no
steynholme
resident
should
be
made
aware
of
his
death
she
wondered
why
she
was
enlightened
when
furneaux
paid
a
call
about
she
took
him
into
the
garden
the
lawn
at
was
empty
you
entertained
an
acquaintance
yesterday
he
began
am
i
to
tell
you
what
happened
a
great
deal
i
imagine
he
said
with
a
puzzling
laugh
but
i
annoyed
him
as
names
broke
in
the
detective
hastily
especially
modern
ones
destroy
romance
even
the
georgian
method
of
using
initials
or
leaving
out
vowels
lend
an
air
of
intrigue
to
the
veriest
no
one
can
overhear
us
was
the
somewhat
surprised
comment
true
said
furneaux
me
miss
martin
tell
the
story
in
your
own
doris
had
a
good
memory
she
was
invariably
in
a
play
after
a
couple
of
rehearsals
and
could
prompt
others
if
they
faltered
the
detective
listened
in
silence
while
she
repeated
the
conversation
between
siddle
and
herself
he
took
no
notes
in
fact
he
hardly
ever
did
make
any
record
in
a
case
unless
it
was
essential
to
prove
the
exact
words
of
a
suspected
person
he
said
when
she
had
finished
sounds
like
the
complete
think
i
have
left
out
anything
of
is
if
a
single
word
of
it
heaps
he
assured
her
even
better
than
i
dared
hope
can
you
tell
me
if
mother
is
dead
yet
the
question
found
doris
so
thoroughly
unprepared
that
she
blurted
out
you
had
a
telegram
too
then
but
siddle
has
had
one
eh
be
vexed
not
tricking
you
into
revealing
post
office
secrets
i
knew
she
was
dying
and
when
i
saw
your
father
take
a
message
to
the
shop
i
simply
made
an
accurate
guess
now
going
to
scare
you
purposely
and
of
malice
aforethought
because
i
want
you
to
be
a
good
little
girl
and
obey
orders
siddle
senior
now
happily
deceased
was
an
epileptic
lunatic
of
a
peculiarly
dangerous
type
she
suffered
from
what
is
classed
by
the
doctors
as
a
form
of
spasmodic
insanity
not
inconsistent
with
a
high
degree
of
bodily
vigor
and
long
periods
of
apparently
complete
mental
saneness
now
if
i
were
not
speaking
to
one
who
has
shared
her
studies
in
i
would
not
introduce
the
subject
of
heredity
but
know
miss
martin
that
such
racial
characteristics
are
transmitted
or
transmissible
i
should
say
by
sex
opposites
thus
an
epileptic
mother
is
more
likely
to
give
her
taint
to
a
son
than
to
a
daughter
yes
i
mean
all
that
and
more
he
went
on
seeing
the
look
of
horror
not
unmixed
with
fear
in
eyes
must
be
no
more
irritating
of
siddle
or
playing
on
his
you
at
any
rate
treat
him
gently
if
he
insists
on
making
love
to
you
be
as
firm
as
you
like
in
a
way
i
mean
by
that
an
entire
absence
on
your
part
of
any
suggestion
that
you
are
repulsing
him
because
of
a
real
or
supposed
preference
for
any
other
you
want
me
to
believe
that
he
is
liable
to
attack
me
demanded
the
girl
her
naturally
courageous
spirit
coming
to
her
aid
do
said
furneaux
speaking
with
marked
earnestness
you
ask
me
to
endure
his
company
if
he
chooses
to
force
himself
on
me
a
few
it
may
be
a
few
years
that
is
not
to
be
thought
of
leave
it
to
me
to
devise
a
way
besides
you
need
not
allow
him
so
many
opportunities
that
the
strain
would
become
unbearable
you
are
busy
owing
to
the
certain
increase
of
work
brought
about
by
this
murder
your
time
will
be
greatly
occupied
but
render
him
morbidly
suspicious
for
instance
no
more
dinners
at
no
more
gadding
about
by
night
if
you
hear
weird
noises
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
you
must
absolutely
deny
yourself
the
pleasurable
excitement
of
are
carrying
a
warning
to
its
extreme
am
i
to
keep
this
knowledge
to
myself
whom
would
you
confide
father
of
know
you
better
and
the
voice
took
on
a
profoundly
serious
note
father
would
never
admit
that
what
he
knows
to
be
true
of
bees
is
equally
true
of
humanity
you
can
trust
the
police
to
keep
a
pretty
sharp
eye
on
siddle
of
course
but
the
present
is
a
strenuous
period
both
for
us
and
for
people
with
maniacal
tendencies
so
accidents
may
have
distressed
me
immeasurably
said
the
girl
striving
to
pierce
the
mask
of
that
inscrutable
face
meant
to
answered
furneaux
quietly
half
measures
for
me
looked
up
the
asylum
record
of
siddle
senior
and
not
nice
was
a
siddle
junior
then
theodore
siddle
if
one
adopts
the
conventional
usage
yes
she
died
last
month
gasped
doris
feeling
vaguely
that
she
was
moving
in
a
maze
of
deceit
and
subterfuge
may
to
be
precise
she
lived
apart
from
her
husband
i
have
reason
to
believe
she
feared
she
hesitated
hardly
able
to
put
her
jumbled
thoughts
into
words
so
said
the
detective
instantly
mind
a
fairly
decent
world
taken
i
ought
to
speak
with
authority
i
see
enough
of
the
seamy
side
of
it
goodness
knows
now
forewarned
is
forearmed
be
nervous
take
risks
everything
will
come
right
in
time
remember
not
far
away
in
an
emergency
should
i
chance
to
be
absent
if
you
need
advice
send
for
franklin
you
can
easily
devise
some
official
excuse
a
mislaid
letter
or
an
error
in
a
think
i
shall
feel
confident
if
both
of
you
are

impishness

doris
suddenly
the
two
looked
into
each
eyes
doris
was
eager
to
ask
a
question
which
furneaux
dared
her
to
put

detective
won

sighed
well
she
said
to

myself

furneaux

of
nineteen
doris

uncommonly
gifted
with
clear
analytical

powers
the
detective
returned
to
the

went
upstairs
he

the

succeeded

the

dryly
lived
there
this
to

glowered
the
big
man
fearing
the
worst
the
answer
is
cackled
furneaux
wally
laughed
he
had
remembered
just
in
time
that
he
had
no
right
to
claim
acquaintance
with
the
representative
of
scotland
yard
and
there
were
some
farmers
present
each
of
whom
had
a
to
offer
the
buyer
of

i
think
right
he

they
looked
through

the
two
were
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
wally
was
shaking
peters
violently
the
argument
was
not
so
fierce
as
it
appeared
to
be
peters
had
been
commanded
to
bring
both
detectives
to
dinner
that
evening
when
he
demurred
trying
to
hedge
on
the
question
of
identity
hart
grabbed
him
by
the
shoulder
as
i
tell
you
he
hissed

i

now
that
the
big
fellow
is
the

so
vigorously

answer
for
the

wishing
devoutly
that
sellers
of
horseflesh
were
not
so
numerous
in
the
district
noted
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
local
men
and
promised
to
write
when
he
could
make
an
appointment
then
he
escaped
upstairs
whither
furneaux
soon
followed
winter
had
secured
an
extra
bedroom
overlooking
the
river
which
tomlin
had
converted
into

he
held

what
possessed
you
to

that
cheerful

put
you
in

could

i
was
extracting
some
really
helpful
facts
about
siddle
and
elkin
from
tomlin
and
the
others
when
a
whirlwind
blew
in
and
nearly
embraced
me
because
i
claimed
acquaintance
with
the
el
dorado
bar
in
buenos
ayres
from
that
instant
i
was
lost
like
augustine
on
the

no
sooner
was
i
nicely
toasted
on
one
side
than
i
was
turned
on
to
the

grinning

too
helped
as

till

asks

fairly
sickened

would
have

i

a

of

on

i
admit
the
chance

taken
by
the

with

with
the
result
that
i
was
able
to
occupy
a
strategic
position
on
the
cliff
and
hear
every

uttered

was

showed

that

you

is
that

the

to

house
from
the
knoleworth
road
was
discernible
dramatic
announcement
brought
the
other
two
to
the
window
by
this
time
peters
gifted
with
a
nose
for
news
like
a
for
partridges
had
begun
to
associate
the
chemist
with
the
inner
circle
of
the
crime
so
waited
and
watched
with
the
detectives
for
reappearance
at
any
rate
the
visitor
must
have
been
admitted
because
a
long
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
before
he
came
in
sight
again
he
walked
out
slowly
into
the
roadway
thrust
his
hands
into
his
trousers
pockets
and
glanced
to
right
and
left
then
turning
abruptly
he
stared
at
the
dwelling
he
had
just
quitted
what
this
slight
but
peculiar
action
signified
was
not
hard
to
guess
furneaux
indeed
put
it
into
words
warned

off
miss
doris
martin
and
been
cursed
for
his
pains
the
foreman
of
the
jury
does
not
trouble
to
await
further
evidence
but
arrives
at
a
true
and
lawful
verdict
straight
off
announced
the
little
man
ought
to
hear
things
said
peters
inquired
winter
i
make
it
clear
that
i
shared
in
the
dinner
invitation
and
say
it
pleaded
the
journalist
i
fell
from
grace
remember
my
unswerving
loyalty
since
the
hour
we
met
on
the
platform
at
knoleworth
i
kept
close
as
an
oyster
and
would
any
consideration
on
earth
move
me
to
publish
an
accurate
and
entertaining
account
of
the
roasting
of
chief
inspector
winter
by
wally
hart
think
what
column
of
the
winter
bent
a
weighing
look
on
the
speaker
there
was
treason
in
the
thought
as
king
james
remarked
to
the
barber
who
tried
to
prove
his
loyalty
by
pointing
out
how
easily
he
might
cut
his
throat
any
morning
but
peters
maintained
the
expression
of
a
sphinx
and
the
big
man
relaxed
conditions
are
that
not
a
word
about
this
business
appears
in
print
either
now
or
in
the
future
until
we
have
a
criminal
in
the
dock
he
said
said
peters
furneaux
laughed
shrilly
even
derisively
but
him
his
colleague
treated
with
majestic
disdain
then
the
chemist
having
reentered
the
village
the
group
broke
up
peters
to
search
his
brains
for
which
should
be
readable
yet
contain
no
hint
of
the
new
trail
winter
to
take
train
to
knoleworth
and
furneaux
to
tackle
fred
elkin
who
he
had
ascertained
earlier
would
drive
home
from
a
neighboring
hamlet
about
five
elkin
had
returned
when
the
detective
reached
the
house
a
somewhat
pretentious
place
half
farm
half
villa
and
altogether
horsey
the
entrance
hall
bristled
with
fox
masks
and
brushes
a
useful
collection
of
burnished
bits
and
snaffles
hung
on
a
side

a
couple
of
stuffed
badgers
held
two

stands
for
sticks

were
ranged
on

pert
took

blanched
when
she
read
it
and
forgot
to
close
the
door
of
the
hence
the
detective
heard
gruff
comments
chap
wants
to
see
me
not
more
than
i
want
to
see
him
show
him
furneaux
looking
very
meek
and
mild
entered
an
apartment
of
the
upholstery
period
a
set
of
six
exceedingly
good
and
rare
sporting
prints
caught
his
eye
day
he
said
finding
elkin
drinking
tea
and
eating
a
boiled
egg
feeling
better
glad
to
now
no
matter
how
ungracious
a
man
may
be
a
courteous
solicitude
as
to
his
health
demands
a
certain
note
of
civility
in
return
he
said
down
will
you
join
me
have
a
cup
of
tea
with
pleasure
said
furneaux
just
touch
that
bell
will
you
the
other
obeyed
and
took
a
closer
look
at
one
of
the
prints
yes
the
date
was
right
and
the
stippling
admirable
lot
of
pictures
those
he
said
cheerfully
when
the
frightened
maid
much
to
her
relief
had
been
told
to
bring
another
cup
and
a
fresh
supply
of
toast
they
elkin
had
taken
them
and
some
kitchen
furniture
for
a
bad
debt
will
you
sell
them
i
thought
about
it
you
give
furneaux
hesitated
resist
anything
in
the
art
line
that
takes
my
fancy
he
said
after
a
pause
of
indecision
do
you
say
to
ten
bob
each
elkin
valued
the
lot
at
that
figure
but
furneaux
was
a
fool
and
should
be
treated
as
such
come
now
he
cried
roguishly
worth
more
than
furneaux
reflected
again
pounds
is
a
good
deal
for
six
prints
he
murmured
to
get
it
off
my
mind
spring
to
it
and
guineas
is
my
absolute
limit
said
furneaux
cried
elkin
the
original
debt
was
under
two
pounds
so
he
had
cleared
more
than
fifty
per
cent
on
the
transaction
and
was
plus
a
number
of
chairs
and
a
table
furneaux
counted
out
the
money
wrote
a
receipt
on
a
leaf
torn
from
his
and
stamped
it
that
he
said
the
cash
send
the
set
to
the
hare
and
hounds
for
me
in
a
now
and
the
deal
is
leaving
the
table
he
went
and
lifted
down
each
picture
carefully
somewhat
wonderingly
elkin
rang
the
bell
once
more
gave
the
necessary
instructions
and
the
room
was
cleared
of
its
art
he
was
quite
sure
now
that
furneaux
was
as
he
put
it
the
latter
however
sat
and
enjoyed
his
tea
as
though
well
pleased
with
his
bargain
how
are
things
going
in
the
murder
at
inquired
the
by
way
of
a
polite
leading
up
to
the
unexplained
business
well
said
the
detective
chief
difficulty
was
to
convince
certain
important
people
that
you
kill
miss
melhuish
once
roared
elkin
his
pale
blue
eyes
assuming
a
fiery
tint
i
established
that
fact
went
on
the
other
severely
real
was
removed
you
see
elkin
you
have
behaved
throughout
like
a
perfect
fool
and
thus
lent
a
sort
of
credibility
to
an
otherwise
absurd
notion
your
furious
hatred
of
grant
for
instance
born
of
an
equally
shall
i
say
that
miss
martin
would
marry
you
for
the
mere
asking
led
you
into
deep
waters
it
was
a
mistake
too
when
you
lied
to
robinson
as
to
the
time
you
came
home
on
that
monday
night
you
told
him
you
walked
straight
here
from
the
hare
and
hounds
at
ten
you
know
you
it
was
nearer
half
past
eleven
when
you
reached
this
house
consider
what
that
discrepancy
alone
might
have
meant
if
scotland
yard
failed
to
take
your
measure
correctly
then
add
the
fact
that
the
murderer
wore
the
hat
wig
and
whiskers
in
which
you
made
a
guy
of
yourself
while
filling
the
rôle
of
svengali
last
winter
now
i
ask
you
elkin
where
would
you
have
stood
with
the
average
british
jury
when
the
prosecution
established
those
three
things
motive
your
jealousy
of
grant
time
your
disappearance
during
the
hour
when
the
crime
was
committed
and
disguise
a
clumsy
suggestion
of
owd
ghost
really
i
have
known
men
brought
to
the
scaffold
on
circumstantial
evidence
little
stronger
than
that
instead
of
glaring
at
me
like
a
cornered
rat
you
ought
to
drop
on
your

and
thank
providence
as
manifested
through
the
intelligence
of
the
that
you
are
not
now
in
a
cell
at
knoleworth
ruminating
on
your
own
stupidity
and
in
no
small
jeopardy
of
your
many
emotions
chased
each
other
across
fred
somewhat
mean
and
cruel
face
while
furneaux
rated
him
in
this
extraordinary
manner
surprise
wrath
even
fear
had
their
phases
but
dominating
all
other
sensations
was
an
overpowering
indignation
at
the
implied
hopelessness
of
his
pursuit
of
doris
martin
he
literally
howled
an
oath
at
his
torturer
furneaux
was
shocked
no
he
protested
in
a
horrified
tone
swear
at
your
best
make
you
pay
for
what
said
a
law
to
stop
that
sort
of
the
law
requires
witnesses
a
slander
a
slander
unless
uttered
to
your
detriment
before
a
third
party
how
different
would
be
action
against
you
your
simply
muzzle
you
whether
before
your
cronies
or
mere
strangers
you
charged
him
openly
with
being
a
murderer
sorry
for
you
elkin
if
ever
you
come
before
a
judge
rattle
more
than
my
three
guineas
out
of
you
even
now
you
grasp
the
extent
of
your
folly
instead
of
telling
me
how
you
spent
that
hour
and
a
half
on
the
night
of
the
crime
you
have
the
incredible
audacity
to
threaten
me
the
man
who
has
saved
you
from
jail
one
more
word
you
miserable
swab
and
let
robinson
arrest
you
be
set
free
of
course
when
i
stage
the
actual
villain
but
a
few
remands
of
a
week
each
in
custody
will
thin
your
hot
blood
you
were
with
peggy
smith
after
leaving
the
hare
and
hounds
making
a
fool
of
an
honest
girl
who
thinks
you
mean
to
wed
her
yet
you
blather
about
being
to
doris
martin
a
girl
who
let
you
tie
her
an
impudent
pup
fred
and
you
know
it
but
you
stock
decent
tea
so
take
another
cup
if
wise
take
a
second
one
yourself
better
for
you
than
elkin
despite
all
his
faults
was
endowed
with
the
shrewdness
inseparable
from
his
business
because
no
man
devoid
of
brains
ever
yet
throve
as
a
he
smothered
his
rage
thinking
he
might
learn
more
from
this
detective
by
seeming
complaisance
a
bit
rough
on
a
fellow
he
growled
sulkily
pouring
out
the
tea
your
good

solely
for
your
good
now
own
up
about

prove
an

so
your
case
breaks
down
when
the

anything
to

her
supposed

how
will
the

on

what
did
mean
for

by
your
question
to
the
coroner
at
the
first
hearing
thought
grant
was
guilty
and
i
think
so
still
came
the
savage
retort
nice
juryman
you
are
i
must
say
may
i
trouble
you
to
pass
the
sugar
here
what
are
you
at
damme
if
i
can
see
through
your
game
what
is
it
want
to
worry
poor
peggy
and
her
father
might
set
about
you
if
he
knew
the
facts
so
probably
saving
you
a
hiding
as
well
as
a
period
in
jail
the
only
reliable
witness
we
had
as
to
events
in
place
was
a
commercial
traveler
and
he
is
positive
that
the
house
closed
at
ten
however
all
right
how
do
you
account
for
the
marvelous
improvement
in
your
health
foxton
can
not
understand
your
illness
he
says
you
are
wiry
and
have
a
strong
foxton
jolly
near
knocked
me
up
said
elkin
took
his
medicine
till
i
was
sick
as
a
you
took
spirits
nothing
fresh
anyhow
dropped
both
and
am
picking
up
every
when
yesterday
morning
if
you
want
to
do
most
interested
foxton
compound
his
own
prescriptions
does
he
i
get
made
up
at
these
country
chemists
often
keep
drugs
in
stock
till
they
deteriorate
or
even
set
up
chemical
changes
have
you
the
bottles
but
what
left
in
them
last
two
are
half
full
a
chap
you
are
i
buy
your
pictures
drink
your
tea
rescue
you
from
a
positively
dangerous
position
warn
you
against
carrying
any
farther
a
most
serious
libel
yet
you
let
me
help
you
in
a
matter
affecting
your
health
me
how
you
i
suppose
realize
that
scotland
yard
employs
skilled
analysts
give
me
your
bottles
in
strict
confidence
of
course
and
tell
you
what
they
really
contain
then
you
can
compare
the
analyses
with
the
prescriptions
the
knowledge
should
be
useful
to
say
the
least
reputation
suffer
but
unless
i
am
greatly
mistaken
you
will
have
the
whip
hand
of
him
in
the
prospect
was
alluring
elkin
would
enjoy
showing
up
the
chemist
who
had
treated
him
rather
as
a
precocious
infant
of
late
jing
he
cried
on
that
bet
you
a
no
hardly
lay
against
your
own
opinion
just
wait
a
tick
bring
furneaux
stared
fixedly
at
the
table
while
his
host
was
absent
his
conscience
was
not
pricking
him
with
regard
to
an
unmerited
slur
on
the
country
chemists
of
great
britain
all
is
fair
in
love
and
the
detection
of
crime
and
he
simply
had
to
get
hold
of
those
bottles
by
some
daring
yet
plausible
ruse
wonder
he
muttered
as
step
sounded
on
the
stairs
you
are
grinned
the
a
dose
of
the
last
one
stir
your
liver
to
some
furneaux
drew
the
corks
out
of
both
bottles
and
sniffed
the
contents
then
he
tasted
with
much
he
said
laudanum
for
a
start
i
expected
as
much
bought
by
the
gallon
and
sold
by
the
drop
is
that
the
dogcart
with
my
pictures
your
man
he
can
give
me
a
lots
of
things
i
want
to
ask
here
to
put
questions
not
to
give
information
gone
a
long
way
beyond
the
official
tether
already
if
a
grain
of
sense
and
i
think
not
altogether
lacking
in
that
respect
keep
a
close
tongue
and
act
on
the
tips
thrown
out
find
pearls
of
price
among
the
of
my
remarks
generally
see
you
on
and
furneaux
climbed
into
the
cart
holding
the
pictures
so
that
they
would
not
rattle
and
perhaps
loosen
the
old
gilded
frames
me
to
the
he
said
to
the
groom
within
five
minutes
he
was
explaining
his
purchase
to
siddle
and
requesting
as
a
favor
that
the
latter
should
wrap
the
set
of
prints
in
brown
paper
making
two
parcels
and
tying
each
securely
so
that
they
might
be
dispatched
by
train
siddle
examined
one
the
first
of
the
series
which
depicted
the
aylesbury
steeplechase
good
he
said
did
you
pick
them
up
what
an
unexpected
place
the
only
way
a
poor
man
can
get
hold
of
a
decent
thing
nowadays
the
dealers
grab
everything
and
sell
them
as
is
not
in
my
line
though
anyone
can
see
that
these
are
but
looking
at
have
a
peep
at
this
one
the
artist
have
his
joke
you
see
that
the
dark
horse
did
you
persuade
elkin
to
part
with
them
paying
him
a
tempting
price
of
course
a
ass
in
such
the
chemist
busied
himself
to
oblige
the
detective
wrapping
and
tying
the
packages
neatly
furneaux
insisted
on
paying
sixpence
for
the
paper
string
and
labor
there
was
quite
a
friendly
argument
but
he
carried
his
point
the
then
brought
him
to
the
station
where
he
tipped
and
dismissed
the
man
a
little
later
he
caught
a
train
at
half
past
seven
precisely
winter
turned
in
through
the
gate
of

were
two
the
approach
to
the
house
being
and
pushed
the
door
open
as
it
was
standing
ajar
grant
was
waiting
in
the
hall
and
greeted
him
pleasantly
a
telegram
which
is
meant
for
you
i
fancy
he
said
winter
read
to
spoil
your
party
compelled
to
travel
to
london
returning
early
pretty
way
smiled
the
chief
inspector
something
in
the
wind
or
he
would
never
have
hurried
off
in
this
fashion
he
tells
me
that
the
only
pleasant
evening
he
spent
in
steynholme
was
under
your
roof
along
in
don
jaime
drawled
voice
from
the
which
had
been
cleared
of
its
litter
the
lawn
being
deemed
somewhat
unsuitable
for
the
purposes
of
a
on
that
occasion
it
was
overlooked
from
too
many
quarters
we
meet
now
under
less
uneven
conditions
hart
said
winter
you
know
that
enrico
suarez
is
in
london
hart
startled
for
once
in
his
life
gazed
at
the
detective
fixedly
when
he
cried
crossed
from
lisbon

hart
took
a
revolver
from
his
hip
pocket
and
opened
it
apparently
making
sure
that
it
was
properly
loaded

he
inquired
i
shoot
first
or
must
i
wait
till
the
other
fellow
has
had
a
pop
winter
laughed
all
right
he
said
is
in
holloway
awaiting
extradition
but
i
owed
you
one
for
the
rise
you
took
out
of
me
a
bell
sounded
and
peters
came
in
he
glanced
around
furneaux
he
demanded
to
london
why
this
keen
interest
said
winter
something
up
elkin
dropped
in
at
the
hare
and
hounds
he
was
simply
bursting
with
curiosity
and
had
to
talk
to
somebody
so
he
chose
would
was
the
dry
comment
me
honor
i
lead
him
on
an
inch
it
seems
that
furneaux
bought
some
prints
which
caught
his
eye
in
house
and
tomlin
says
that
that
hexplains
what
visit
to
siddle
and
certain
bulky
parcels
brought
in
and
brought
out

furneaux
said
hart
that
my
mind
is
at
ease
about
the
immediate
future
of
the
biggest
rascal

the

at
the

lots

am
indifferent

during

attentive
to
his

but
markedly
silent
almost
distrait
two
such
talkers
as
hart

peters
however
covered
any
gaps
in

implored
you
to
consider
doris

in
the

such
shocks
were
losing
some
of
their
effect
on
the
principle
that
a
man
hears
the
burst
of
the
thousandth
shell
with
a
good
deal
less
trepidation
than
attended
the
efforts
of

dozen

at

profound
astonishment

quietly
that

him
that
after
wednesday
i
would
ask
doris

to

me
which
is
the

i
can

him
and
all
the

then
the
full
extent
of
the
annoyance
which
ingerman
can
you
give
siddle
that
reason
winter

he

vexedly

such
adepts
in
analyzing
human
duplicity
in
your
books
that
you
never
dream
of
trying
to
be
wise
as
a
serpent
in
your

affairs
the
author
who
will
split
legal
hairs
by
way
of
brightening
his
work
will
sign
a
contract
with
a
publisher
that
draws
tears
from

candid
with

went
on
well

stop
irrelevant
statements
especially
if
ready
for
them
but
there
must
be
no
more
of
this
to
all

is
your

he
too
wants
to
marry
miss
martin

regards
you
now
as
the
only

indeed
monstrous

rather
heatedly
nevertheless
a

for

he
laughed
keen
eyes
were
watching
him
and
wally

was
giving
more

to
the

than
was
revealed
by
a
fixed
stare
at
the
head

bothered
me
he
went
on

you
had
more
sense
you
understand
that
all
these
bits
of
gossip
reach
ingerman
through
the
filter
of
the
snug
at
the
hare
and
hounds
visit
was
unexpected
and
his
mission
even
more
so
i
just
blurted
out
the
rendered
the
services
of
a
solicitor
absolutely
indispensable
grant
by
no
means
so
these
days
as
was
his
wont
followed
the
scent
of
red
herring
like
the
youngest
hound
in
a
pack
but
wally
hart
and
peters
in
this
chase
harked
back
to
the
right
line
they
both
broke
in
simultaneously
to
the
fourth
estate
bowed
hart
solemnly
said
the

i
put
a
question
winter
score
if
you
up
the
average
of
the
murder
cases
in
which
furneaux
and
you
have
been
engaged
in
how
many
days
do
you
count
on
spotting
your
man
we
never
get
come
a
bit
closer
than
given
a
clear
run
with
an
established
motive
we
know
who
he
is
within
eight
in
effect
say
this
time
as
a
hypothesis
you
are
convinced
of
a
guilt
but
can
obtain
little
or
no
evidence
goes
through
life
a
free
and
independent
citizen
of
this
or
any
other
country
arrests
on
suspicion
are
not
my
long
does
one
get
evidence
purred
hart
scattered
broadcast
by
a
clever
criminal
and
you
fellows
seem
to
object
to
my
method
which
has
been
the
only
effectual
one
so
far
in
this
you
had
shot
that
specter
the
other
night
there
would
have
been
the
deuce
to
you
would
now
be

of
the

you

from

of
his

he
was
skating
on
thin
ice
so
hastened
to
escape
work
is
nearly
all
guessing
he
said
sententiously
one
must
beware
of
what
i
may
term
obvious
guessing
if
cause
and
effect
were
so
closely
allied
in
certain
classes
of
crime
my
department
would
cease
to
exist
and
the
protection
of
life
and
property
might
be
left
safely
to
the
ordinary
police
by
the
way
robinson
has
been
rather
inactive
during
two
whole
days
that
makes
me
suspicious
he
up
to
can
you
throw
a
light
on
him
peters
the

knew
that
he
was
being
told
peremptorily
to
cease
prying

is

closed

firmly
well

the

feelings
have
recovered

to
you

he
waste
his
money
even
for
official
but
winter
was
well
aware
of
and
kept
to
himself
one
phase
of
the
art
deal
at
any
rate
furneaux
had
persuaded
siddle
to
fasten
two
bulky
packages
with
string
he
was
shaving
next
morning
when
his
colleague
entered
spruce
as
ever
in
attire
but
looking
rather
weary
the
little
man
flung
himself
at
full
length
on
bed
up
all
night
he
explained
analysis
is
fascinating
but
slow
watching
a
moth
evolve
from
a
grub
had
a
fearful
job
too
to
get
an
analyst
to
chuck
a
theater
and
attend
to
business
the
blighter
talked
of
office
hours
ten
till
four
and
an
hour
and
a
half
for
lunch
why
we

on
those
lines
james
winter
finished
carefully
the
left
side
of
his
broad
expanse
of
face
came
down
by
the
mail
i
suppose
he
said
casually
a
genius
you
are
sighed
furneaux
were
trembling
with
expectation
i
could
no
more
put
a
banal
question
like
that
than
swallow
the
razor
after
i
was
done
with
it
you
might
at
least
have
the
common
decency
to
thank
me
for
leaving
you
to
gorge
on
rare
meats
and
vintage
wines
while
i
dallied
with
the
deadly
railway
winter
scraped
the

and

twelve
so
give
you
a
condensed
version
snapped
furneaux
illness
begun
by
whiskey
and
developed
into
steady
poisoning
by
siddle
the
chemist
used
a
rare
agent
in
a
sense
to
detect
but
capable
of
a
dozen
reasonable
explanations
when
revealed
by
the
but
elkin
to
be
killed
outright
i
gather
the
idea
was
to
upset
stomach
and
brain
till
he
was
half
crazy
as

the

when
her
hat
blew
off
with
the
fluffy
transformation
pinned
to
winter
rushed
to
the
bathroom
and
furneaux
crept
languidly
to
bed
before
going
to
knoleworth
franklin
consulted
with
tomlin
as
to
a
suitable
dinner
to
which

important
point

franklin
caught
an
early
train
and
was
absent
all
day
being
in
fact
closeted
with
superintendent
fowler
and
a
treasury
solicitor
furneaux
was
sound
asleep
long
after
twelve
and
swore
at
tomlin
in
french
when
the
landlord
ventured
to
arouse
him
tomlin
went
downstairs
scratching
his
head

he
communed

murdered
in
our

he
cheered
up
towards
night
ingerman
a
lawyer
and
some
pressmen
arriving
for
the
inquest
filled
every
available
room
and
the
kitchen
was
redolent
of
good
fare
all
parties
gathered
in
the
of
course
and
ingerman
had
an
eye
for
party
the
scraps
of
talk
he
overheard
were
nothing
more
exciting
than
the
prospects
of
a
certain
horse
for
the
cup
peters
had
the
tip
straight
from
the
stables
a
racing
certainty
with
a
stone
in
hand
after
dinner
the
financier
was
surprised
when
furneaux
approached
and
tapped
him
professionally
on
the
shoulder
word
with
you
outside
he
said
ingerman
was
slightly
alarmed
we
talk
here
he
said
in
that
singularly
melodious
voice
of
his
not
but
i
detain
you
more
than
five
my
legal
adviser
might
wish
to
hear
from
me
tell
him
yourself
afterwards
if
you
in
the
quiet
street
the
detective
suddenly
linked
arms
with
his
companion
probably
he
smiled
sardonically
when
he
felt
a
telltale
quiver
run
through
lanky
frame
brought
down
norris
i
see
he
began
to
make
things
hot
for
grant
tomorrow
to
give
justice
the
the

i
know
you
and
high
time
you

ah
that
gets

does
it
you

belcher
now
be
reasonable
or
rather
run
your
head
into
a
noose
grant
had
no
more
to
do
with
the
murder
of
your
wife
than
you
had
call
off
norris
and
grant
withdraws
belcher
twig
dead
easy
because
the
treasury
solicitor
will
simply
ask
for
another
adjournment
as
the
police
are
not
ready
to
go
on
in
the
meantime
you
pay
off
norris
and
save
your
face
is
it
a
deal
i
to
wriggle
the
key
of
the
situation
is
held
by
belcher
name
of
a
pipe
what
prompting
does
belcher
need
from
me
or
anybody
else
after
the
bokfontein
lands
case
this
is
the
last
word
i
was
at
the
funeral
on
saturday
and
met
your
mother
and
sister
they
do
love
you
they
ingerman
died
game
i
have
your
assurance
that
grant
is
really
innocent
of
death
that
is
sufficient
he
said
slowly
if
it
pleases
you
to
put
it
that
way
agreeable
which
is
your
road
back
to
the
hotel
for
a
short
stroll
mind
you
no
wobbling
go
straight
and
attend
to
belcher
but
good
lord
how
his
eyes
will
sparkle
when
they
light
on
you
neither
the
redoubtable
belcher
nor
the
bokfontein
lands
nor
poor
adelaide
mother
and
sister
may
figure
further
in
this
chronicle
the
inquest
opened
at
the
appointed
hour
next
day
and
was
closed
down
again
for
a
week
with
a
celerity
that
was
most
disappointing
both
to
the
jury
and
the
general
public
of
three
legal
luminaries
present
only
one
the
treasury
man
uttered
a
few
bald
words
belcher
and
norris
did
not
even
announce
the
names
of
their
clients
norris
noticed
that
belcher
surveyed
ingerman
with
a
grim
smile
but
thought
nothing
of
it
until
he
received
a
check
later
in
the
week
then
he
made
some
inquiries
and
smiled
himself
the
foreman
of
the
jury
looked
a
trifle
pinched
though
his
cheeks
bore
two
spots
of
hectic
color
franklin
drawn
to
the
court
by
curiosity
happened
to
glance
at
him
once
and
found
him
gazing
at
furneaux
in
a
peculiarly
thoughtful
manner
elkin
thriving
on
a
diet
of
tea
and
eggs
was
also
interested
in
the
representative
of
scotland
yard
he
seemed
to
ignore
grant
entirely
doris
martin
was
not
in
court
superintendent
fowler
had
called
about
half
past
nine
to
tell
her
she
would
not
be
asked
to
attend
that
day
near
franklin
sat
a
few
village
notabilities
who
since
they
had
not
the
remotest
connection
with
anyone
concerned
in
the
tragedy
have
been
left
hitherto
in
their
olympian
solitude
he
listened
to
their
comments
usual
the
police
are
utterly
at
sea
said
one
up
important
clews
the
newspapers
say
scoffed
another
a
disgraceful
thing
if
a
crime
like
this
goes
undetected
and
is
the
scotland
yard
man
small
chap
in
the
blue
little
rat
sharp
i
met
a
man
in
the
train
and
he
told
franklin
grinned
amiably
hobbs
the
butcher
intercepting
his
eye
grinned
back
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
what
portion
of
the
foregoing
small
talk
reached
furneaux
subsequently
oddly
enough
both
detectives
had
missed
a
brief
but
illuminating
incident
which
took
place
in
the
hare
and
hounds
the
previous
night
while
winter
was
finishing
a
cigar
with
peters
and
furneaux
was
bludgeoning
ingerman
into
compliance
with
his
wishes
remarkable
improvement
in
health
was
commented
on
by
hobbs
and
siddle
took
the
credit
last
mixture
has
proved
beneficial
then
he
said
eying
the
closely
smirked
elkin
only
fair
to
say
that
chucked
whiskey
you
finish
the
bottle
bottle
of
take
any
more
it
was
decidedly
strong
send
a
boy
early
morning
with
a
tonic
and
you
might
give
him
any
old
medicine
bottles
you
possess
running
elkin
hesitated
a
second
or
two
tell
my
housekeeper
to
look
up
he
said
after
the
inquest
he
communicated
this
episode
to
furneaux
as
a
great
joke
it
he
guffawed
couple
of
dozen
bottles
went
back
as
always
getting
stuff
for
the
gees
but
those
two
among
you
took
care
of
that
eh
when
will
you
have
the
analysis
be
fully
a
week
yet
said
the
detective
offices
are
not
run
like
express
trains
and
this
is
a
free
job
you
know
but
be
advised
by
me
stick
to
plain
food
and
throw
physic
to
the
another
singular
fact
unobserved
by
the
public
at
large
was
that
a
policeman
either
robinson
or
a
stranger
patrolled
the
all
day
and
all
night
while
no
one
outside
official
circles
was
aware
that
other
members
of
the
force
watched
or
were
secreted
among
the
trees
on
the
cliffside
from
dusk
to
dawn
next
morning
however
there
was
real
cause
for
talk
shop
was
closed
over
the
neatly
printed
was
gummed
a
notice
away
on
business
will
open
for
one
hour
after
arrival
of
train
everyone
who
passed
stopped
to
read
even
franklin
joined
furneaux
and
peters
in
a
stroll
across
the
road
to
have
a
look
want
you
a
minute
said
the
big
man
suddenly
to
furneaux
there
was
that
in
his
tone
which
forbade
questioning
so
peters
sheered
off
well
content
with
the
share
permitted
him
in
the
inquiry
thus
far
fellow
hart
is
no
fool
went
on
winter
rapidly
said
last
night
does
one
get
evidence
it
was
not
easy
to
answer
siddle
has
gone
to
his
funeral
what
do
you
think
turn
me
into
a
housebreaker
would
you
whined
furneaux
bitterly
must
do
the
job
of
course
just
because
a
little
one
well
well
after
a
long
and
honorable
career
i
have
to
become
a
sneak
thief
it
may
cost
me
my
no
real
difficulty
an
you
a
new
hat
i
went
over
the
ground
before
you
over
it
quickly
now
and
get
something
out
of
it
and
you
a
new
hat
got
any
tools
fetched
from
town
tuesday
morning
chortled
furneaux
now
the
brainy
one
he
skipped
into
the
hotel
while
winter
went
to
the
station
to
make
sure
of
departure
and
destination
yes
the
chemist
had
taken
a
return
ticket
to
epsom
where
a
strip
of
dank
on
the
road
to
esher
marks
the
last
of
many
of
epileptics
on
returning
to
the
winter
lighted
a
cigar
a
somewhat
common
occurrence
in
his
everyday
life
furneaux
walked
swiftly
up
the
hill
a
farmer
living
near
the
center
of
the
village
owned
a
rather
showy
cob
winter
found
the
man
and
persuaded
him
to
trot
the
animal
to
and
fro
in
front
of
the
hotel
there
was
a
good
deal
of
noise
and
and
people
came
to
their
doors
to
see
what
was
going
on
obviously
if
they
were
watching
the
antics
of
a
skittish
in
the
their
eyes
were
blind
to
proceedings
in
the
back
premises
even
the
postmaster
and
his
daughter
were
interested
onlookers
and
a
policeman
who
might
have
put
a
summary
end
to
the
display
vanished
as
though
by
magic
luckily
winter
was
a
good
judge
of
a
horse
when
the
cob
was
stabled
and
the
farmer
came
to
the
inn
to
have
a
drink
he
was
forced
to
admit
a
tendency
to
cow
hocks
which
it
would
seem
is
held
a
fatal
blemish
in
the
argentine
meanwhile
furneaux
had
dodged
into
a
lane
and
thence
to
a
which
emerged
near
bob
forge
when
he
had
traversed
roughly
speaking
of
a
rectangle
in
which
the
hare
and
hounds
occupied
the
center
of
one
of
the
longer
sides
he
climbed
a
gate
and
followed
a
hedge
though
not
losing
a
second
he
took
every
precaution
to
remain
unseen
and
to
the
best
of
his
belief
gained
an
inclosed
yard
at
the
back
of
premises
without
having
attracted
attention
he
slipped
the
catch
of
a
kitchen
window
only
to
discover
that
the
sash
was
fastened
by
screws
also
the
lock
of
the
kitchen
door
yielded
to
persuasion
but
there
were
bolts
above
and
below
a
wire
screen
in
a
larder
window
was
impregnable
short
of
cutting
out
a
pane
of
glass
he
could
not
effect
an
entry
on
the
ground
floor
nimble
as
a
squirrel
and
risking
everything
he
climbed
to
the
roof
of
an
outhouse
and
tried
a
bedroom
window
here
he
succeeded
when
the
catch
was
forced
there
were
no
further
obstacles
in
he
went
pausing
only
to
look
around
and
see
if
any
curious
or
alarmed
eye
was
watching
him
he
wondered
why
every
back
yard
on
that
side
of
the
was
empty
not
even
a
or
woman
washing
clothes
being
in
sight
but
understood
and
grinned
when
the
commotion
winter
was
creating
came
in
view
from
a
front
room
then
he
undertook
a
methodical
search
working
with
a
rapid
yet
painstaking
thoroughness
which
missed
nothing
from
a
wardrobe
he
selected
an
overcoat
and
pair
of
trousers
which
reeked
with
turpentine
they
were
old
and
soiled
garments
very
different
from
the
black
coat
and
waistcoat
with
striped
cloth
trousers
worn
daily
by
the
chemist
he
drew
a
blank
in
the
remainder
of
the
upstairs
rooms
which
included
a
though
he
devoted
fully
quarter
of
an
hour
to
reading
the
titles
of
books
a
safe
in
the
little
dispensing
closet
at
the
back
of
the
shop
promised
sheer
defiance
until
furneaux
saw
a
bunch
of
keys
resting
beside
a
methylated
spirit
lamp
ever
thus
he
cackled
lighting
the
lamp
help
us
poor
detectives
if
it
in
a
word
since
murder
will
out
siddle
had
forgotten
his
keys
probably
he
had
gone
to
the
safe
for
money
and
while
writing
the
notice
as
to
his
absence
had
laid
down
the
keys
and
omitted
to
pick
them
up
again
furneaux
disregarded
ledgers
and
account
books
he
examined
a
bank
and
a
in
a
drawer
which
contained
these
and
a
quantity
of
gold
he
found
a
small
book
with
a
lock
which
no
key
on
the
bunch
was
tiny
enough
to
fit
a
bit
of
twisted
wire
soon
overcame
this
difficulty
and
furneaux
began
to
read
there
were
quaint
diagrams
and
sketches
both
in
plan
and
section
with
curious
notes
and
occasional
records
of
what
appeared
to
be
passages
from
letters
or
conversations
the
detective
read
and
read
referring
back
and
forth
absorbed
in
his
task
no
doubt
but
evidently
puzzled
at
last
he
stuffed
the
book
into
a
pocket
completed
his
scrutiny
of
the
safe
examined
the
bottles
on
the
shelf
labeled
and
took
a
sample
of
the
colorless
contents
of
one
bottle
marked
then
he
went
to
the
kitchen
replaced
all
catches
and
the
lock
of
the
door
and
let
himself
out
by
the
way
he
had
come
winter
saw
him
from
afar
and
hastened
upstairs
to
the
private
furneaux
appeared
there
soon
said
the
chief
inspector
eagerly
him
i
think
said
furneaux
not
much
might
be
gathered
from
that
monosyllabic
question
and
its
answer
but
its
significance
in
ears
could
he
have
heard
would
have
been
that
of
the
passing
bell
tolling
for
the
dead
chapter
xviii
the
truth
at
last
not
often
did
furneaux
qualify
an
opinion
by
that
dubious
phrase
think
which
in
its
colloquial
sense
implies
that
the
thought
contains
a
reservation
as
to
possible
error
winter
looked
anxious
both
he
and
his
colleague
knew
well
when
to
drop
the
banter
they
delighted
in
they
were
face
to
face
now
with
issues
of
life
and
death
dark
and
sinister
conditions
which
had
already
destroyed
one
life
threatened
another
and
might
envisage
further
horrors
small
wonder
then
if
the
chief
usually
cheerful
face
was
clouded
or
that
his
hopes
should
be
somewhat
dashed
when
furneaux
seemed
to
lack
the
abounding
confidence
which
was
his
most
marked
characteristic
got
something
i
see
he
said
trying
to
speak
encouragingly
and
glancing
at
the
bundle
of
clothing
which
furneaux
had
wrapped
in
a
newspaper
before
dropping
from
the
bedroom
window
of
house
a
lot
what
to
make
of
it
is
the
puzzle
we
either
go
ahead
on
the
flimsiest
of
evidence
or
i
carry
out
another
housebreaking
job
this
afternoon
and
restore
things
in
status

infamy

a

of

all
on

clearly
a
of
remarks
when
siddle

on

said

at
any
other
time
furneaux
would
have
waxed
sarcastic
now
he
merely
nodded
in
a
queer
way
he
muttered
a
word
about
the
inquest
or
the
missing
the
preceding
page
held
even
more
disjointed
entries

nevertheless
provided

his

across
the
end
of
several
leaves
can
tell
you
now
he
said
nothing
of
real
value
in
the
earlier
notes
so
far
as
i
can
judge
they
refer
either
to
a
sort
of
settlement
with
his
wife
or
chance
phrases
used
by
doris
martin
which
might
imply
that
she
was

free
not
a
bally
word
dealing
with
the
murder
or
that
can
be
twisted
into
the

allusion
to
it

a
plan
and

have

are

of

and

with

the

was

high
noon
and
a
pastoral
landscape
was
drowned

the

cut
the

off
a

with

he

you

there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
me
in
quick
came
voice
and
the
handle
was
tried
forcibly
away
busy
cried
winter
is
urgent
devilish
urgent
said
peters
furneaux
snatched
up
the
and
winter
tore
off
his
coat
throwing
it
over
the
package
which
reposed
in
an
armchair
then
the
chief
inspector
unlocked
the
door
blocking
the
way
aggressively
i
must
he
began
but
peters
clutched
his
shoulder
with
a
nervous
hand
has
just
hurried
up
the
street
and
entered
his
shop
he
hissed
the
journalist
had
not
only
kept
his
eyes
open
but
excelled
in
the
art
of
putting
two
and
two
together
an
arithmetical
calculation
which
as
applied
to
the
affairs
of
life
is
not
so
readily
arrived
at
as
many
people
imagine
missed
his
keys
shrilled
furneaux
the
man
he
might
at
least
have
attended
his
funeral
stormed
winter
retrieving
his
coat
thus
it
happened
that
furneaux
was
the
first
down
the
stairs
though
the
three
emerged
from
the
door
of
the
inn
on
each
heels
a
stout
man
in
all
likelihood
a
farmer
with
horses
for
sale
was
mounting
the
two
steps
which
led
to
the
entrance
his
head
was
down
and
his
weight
forward
so
he
successfully
resisted
impact
but
peters
and
winter
were
irresistible
and
he
tumbled
over
with
a
muffled
yell
at
that
instant
siddle
quitted
his
shop
and
headed
straight
for
the
post
office
in
his
right
hand
he
carried
an
automatic
pistol
the
street
was
wide
furneaux
absolutely
fearless
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
ran
in
a
curve
so
as
to
bar
the
path
and
it
was
then
that
siddle
saw
him
the
face
was
terrible
to
behold
his
eyes
were
rolling
his
teeth
gnashing
he
had
bitten
his
tongue
and
cheeks
and
his
stertorous
breathing
ejected
from
his
mouth
foam
tinged
with
blood
he
screamed
in
a
falsetto
of
fury
yet
little
man
not
yet
with
that
he
raised
the
pistol
and
fired
at
the
detective
furneaux
ducked
and
seized
a
small
stone
being
otherwise
quite
unarmed
he
threw
it
with
unerring
aim
and
as
was
determined
subsequently
struck
the
hand
holding
the
weapon
possibly
almost
by
a
miracle
the
blow
caused
a
faulty
pressure
because
the
action
jammed
though
the
pistol
itself
was
most
accurate
and
deadly
in
its
properties
by
this
time
winter
sweeping
peters
aside
was
within
ten
feet
of
the
maniac
who
turned
and
ran
into
the
shop
the
door
a
solid
one
fitted
with
a
spring
lock
slammed
in
the
chief
face
and
resisted
a
mighty
effort
to
burst
it
open
a
few
yards
away
stood
an
empty
cart
uptilted
and
winter
demanded
the
help
of
a
few
men
who
had
gathered
on
seeing
or
hearing
the
hubbub
call
on
you
in
the
name
he
shouted
must
force
that
door
then
stand
clear
all
of
you
he
raced
to
the
cart
and
when
his
object
was
perceived
willing
hands
assisted
in
converting
the
heavy
vehicle
into
a
the
gradient
of
the
hill
favored
the
attack
which
was
made
at
an
acute
angle
and
the
first
assault
smashed
the
lock
there
were
a
couple
of
delay
while
the
cart
was
backed
out
and
the
detectives
rushed
in
furneaux
leading
because
winter
gave
his
great
physical
strength
to
the
shafts
but
the
chief
inspector
grabbed
his
tiny
friend
by
the
collar
as
the
latter
darted
around
the
counter
and
into
the
dispensary
in
the
rear
of
us
go
abreast
and
only
get
hurt
he
said
speaking
with
a
calmness
that
was
majestic
in
the
circumstances
nicotine
is
gone
yelped
furneaux
both
saw
that
the
safe
stood
open
behind
the
dispensary
was
a
small
passage
whence
the
stairs
mounted
and
a
door
led
to
the
kitchen
that
door
was
closed
now
though
it
was
open
when
furneaux
ransacked
the
house
therefore
they
made
that
way
at
once
no
ordinary
lock
could
resist
shoulder
and
he
soon
mastered
this
barrier
but
the
kitchen
was
outer
door
locked
but
unbolted
since
it
is
practically
impossible
for
the
strongest
man
to
pull
a
door
open
the

made
for
the
window
and
tore
at
screws
and
catch
with
eager
fingers
furneaux
light
and
scrambled
through
first
so
it
was
he
who
found
siddle
lying
in
the
orchard
beyond
the
wall
of
the
yard
the
unhappy
wretch
had
swallowed
nearly
the
whole
remaining
contents
of
the
bottle
of
nicotine
or
enough
to
poison
a
score
of
robust
men
he
presented
a
lamentable
and
distressing
spectacle
some
of
the
more
venturesome
who
had
crowded
after
the
detectives
and
peters
could
not
bear
to
look
on
and
slunk
away
in
horror
furneaux
soon
brought
an
emetic
which
failed
to
act
siddle
breathed
his
last
while
the
glass
was
at
his
lips
in
that
moment
of
crisis
only
three
men
did
not
lose
their
heads
winter
cleared
away
the
gapers
while
furneaux
remained
with
the
body
robinson
came
up
the
hill
at
a
run
and
was
sent
for
a
stretcher
bringing
from
shop
the
very
one
on
which
the
adelaide
melhuish
was
carried
from
the
river
bank
but
where
was
peters
in
the
post
office
writing
the
first
of
a
series
of
thrilling
dispatches
to
a
london
evening
newspaper
what
journalist
ever
had
a
more
sensational
to
supply
and
when
was
ever
better
primed
for
the
task
he
wrote
on
and
on
till
the
telegraphist
cried
halt
then
he
hied
him
to
london
by
train
and
began
the
more
ambitious
for
next
morning
what
he
did
not
know
he
guessed
correctly
a
fagged
but
triumphant
man
was
jimmie
peters
when
he
to
the
savage
club
at
to
seek
sustenance
and
a
whiskey
and
soda
before
going
home
furneaux
was
white
and
shaken
when
winter
escorted
the
to
the
orchard
devil
he
said
as
the
men
lifted
the
body
from
birth
we
can
eradicate
these
diseases
from
cattle
why
not
from
men
the
villagers
could
not
understand
him
already
in
some
mysterious
way
the
word
had
gone
around
that
siddle
had
murdered
the
actress
and
taken
his
own
life
to
avoid
arrest
after
shooting
at
the
detective
who
was
hot
on
his
trail
not
until
articles
came
back
to
steynholme
did
the
public
at
large
realize
that
the
chemist
undoubtedly
meant
to
kill
doris
martin
he
was
going
straight
to
the
post
office
when
the
way
was
barred
by
furneaux
the
bullet
which
missed
the
latter
actually
pierced
the
zinc
plate
of
the
and
scored
a
furrow
inches
long
in
an
oak
counter
which
it
struck
laterally
the
village
did
not
recover
its
poise
for
hours
grant
and
hart
to
whom
bates
brought
the
news
about
one
rose
from
an
untasted
luncheon
and
hurried
to
the
knots
of
people
stared
at
grant
some
sheepishly
others
with
frank
relief
because
all
who
knew
him
liked
him
one
man
a
retired
ironmonger
and
an
impulsive
fellow
came
forward
and
wrung
his
hand
heartily
a
few
prominent
residents
followed
suit
grant
was
greatly
embarrassed
but
managed
to
endure
these
awkward
if
congratulations
there
could
be
no
mistaking
their
intent
he
had
been
tried
for
murder
at
the
bar
of
public
opinion
and
was
now
formally
acquitted
even
fred
elkin
ignorant
as
yet
of
his
own
peril
yielded
to
the
influences
of
the
moment
and
bustled
through
the
crowd
grant
he
cried
outspokenly
ask
your
pardon
i
seem
to
have
made
a
fool
of
myself
done
than
said
chimed
in
hart
among
all
this
can
anyone
tell
what
has
actually
happened
peters
the
post
the
two
went
in
and
found
the
journalist
scribbling
against
time
hart
coolly
grabbed
a
few
slips
of
manuscript
and
commenced
reading
grant
looked
about
for
doris
she
was
not
visible
but
martin
pallid
and
nervous
nodded
toward
the
the
younger
man
taking
the
gesture
as
a
tacit
invitation
entered
the
room
doris
was
sitting
there
crying
bitterly
poor
girl
she
had
seen
that
portion
of
the
drama
which
was
enacted
in
the
street
and
the
shock
of
it
was
still
poignant
she
looked
up
and
met
her
eyes
neither
uttered
a
word
but
grant
did
a
very
wise
thing
he
caught
her
by
the
shoulders
raised
her
to
her
feet
and
after
kissing
her
squarely
on
the
lips
gave
her
a
comforting
hug
will
be
all
right
now
doris
he
whispered
tenderly
thunderstorms
clear
the
an
eminent
novelist
might
have
found
many
more
ornate
ways
of
avowing
his
sentiments
but
never
a
more
satisfactory
one
at
any
rate
it
served
so
what
more
need
be
said
certain
rills
of
evidence
accumulated
into
a
stream
before
night
fell
robinson
for
instance
scored
a
point
by
ascertaining
that
peggy
smith
had
seen
furneaux
dropping
from
the
bedroom
window
of
the
shop
she
was
some
hundreds
of
yards
away
and
could
not
be
positive
that
some
man
perhaps
a
glazier
had
not
been
there
legitimately
effecting
repairs
still
when
she
met
siddle
hurrying
from
the
station
she
told
him
of
the
incident
never
even
thanked
me
she
said
broke
into
a
run
the
look
in
his
eyes
was
the
girl
had
in
fact
confirmed
his
worst
fears
and
her
neighborly
solicitude
had
merely
hastened
the
end
again
the
railway
officials
showed
that
siddle
had
returned
from
victoria
instead
of
taking
train
to
the
asylum
furneaux
had
guessed
aright
the
discovery
that
his
keys
had
been
left
behind
drove
the
man
into
a
panic
of
fright
it
took
nearly
three
weeks
before
the
unhappy
business
was
finally
disposed
of
a
treasury
solicitor
was
given
the
chance
of
his
career
by
the
disquisition
which
cleared
up
an
extraordinary
record
the
annals
of
the
disease
which
predisposed
theodore
siddle
to
crime
went
back
many
years
he
was
a
fairly
wealthy
man
by
inheritance
and
adopted
the
profession
of
chemistry
as
a
hobby
one
fact
stood
out
boldly
he
was
aware
of
his
hereditary
taint
and
had
settled
down
in
steynholme
believing
that
a
quiet
life
free
from
care
or
the
distractions
of
a
town
would
enable
him
to
overcome
it
probably
the
lawyer
held
the
man
owned
two
distinct
individualities
and
the
baser
instincts
gradually
overpowered
the
humane
ones
of
course
the
whole
history
of
those
trying
days
had
to
come
out
in
open
court
and
the
daughter
was
given
a
descriptive
and
pictorial
boom
which
many
an
actress
envied
peters
was
restored
to
grace
when
he
showed
plainly
that
his
articles
had
kept
the
fickle
barometer
of
public
opinion
at
fair
in
so
far
as
grant
and
doris
were
concerned
as
hart
drawled
during
a
dinner
of
reconciliation
have
been
so
infernally
personal
about
my
grant
and
doris
were
married
before
the
year
was
out
martin
retired
on
a
pension
and
the
young
couple
decided
that
they
could
never
dissociate
from
the
tragic
memories
bound
up
with
its
and
lawn
so
the
place
was
sold
and
steynholme
knows
no
more
winter
and
furneaux
with
them
recently
at
a
pretty
little
nook
in
dorset
hart
just
home
from
the
balkans
traveled
from
town
with
the
detectives
and
doris
a
radiant
young
matron
was
as
flippant
as
the
best
of
them
one
evening
when
the
men
were
sitting
late
in
the
the
talk
turned
on
the
now
drama
in
which
the
hapless
adelaide
melhuish
played
her
last
rôle
met
peters
in
the
savage
club
the
other
night
said
hart
filling
the
pipe
with
care
while
he
talked
he
was
chortling
about
his
study
as
he
called
it
of
that
unfortunate
chemist
he
still
clings
to
the
theory
that
your
wife
was
the
intended
victim
grant
do
you
agree
with
him
cried
furneaux
before
his
host
could
answer
best
peters
is
only
a
clever
ass
siddle
never
had
the
remotest
notion
of
killing
miss
doris
martin
as
grant
was
then
we
shall
never
know
for
certain
just
what
happened
but
there
are
elements
in
the
affair
which
give
ground
for
reasonable
guesswork
the
first
thing
that
impressed
winter
and
least
i
suppose
i
really
evolved
the
idea
though
my
bulky
friend
elaborated
whereat
winter
smiled
forgivingly
and
beheaded
a
fresh
havana
the
complete
noiselessness
of
the
crime
here
we
had
grant
startled
by
the
face
at
the
window
and
actually
searching
outside
the
house
for
the
ghostly
visitant
while
miss
doris
was
gazing
at
from
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
not
a
sound
was
heard
though
it
was
a
night
without
a
breath
of
wind
and
at
an
hour
when
the
splash
of
a
fish
leaping
in
the
stream
would
have
created
a
commotion
now
miss
melhuish
was
an
active
and
young
woman
an
actress
too
and
therefore
likely
to
meet
an
emergency
without
instant
collapse
yet
she
allows
herself
to
be
struck
dead
or
insensible
without
cry
or
struggle
how
do
you
account
for
it
on
charles
be
theatrical
jeered
winter
got
the
story
pat
even
that
simile
of
the
jumping
fish
is
agreed
furneaux
only
brought
it
in
as
a
sop
but
to
continue
as
the
says
it
permissible
to
assume
that
siddle
accompanied
the
lady
either
by
prior
arrangement
or
by
contriving
a
meeting
which
looked
like
mere
chance
we
know
that
she
went
to
his
shop
we
know
too
that
he
was
clever
and
unscrupulous
and
any
allusion
to
grant
would
stir
his
wits
to
the
uttermost
he
would
see
instantly
how
interested
miss
melhuish
was
in
the
owner
of
while
she
a
smart
londoner
would
recognize
in
siddle
an
informant
worth
all
the
rest
of
the
babblers
in
steynholme
at
any
rate
no
matter
how
the
thing
was
brought
about
it
is
that
siddle
brought
his
intended
victim
into
the
grounds
and
told
her
of
the
small
uncovered
window
through
which
she
could
peer
at
grant
after
miss
doris
had
gone
he
showed
her
which
path
to
use
and
undoubtedly
waited
for
her
and
stayed
her
flight
when
grant
rose
from
his
chair
she
was
close
to
him
and
wholly
unafraid
finding
in
him
an
ally
they
were
purposely
hidden
in
the
gloom
of
dense
foliage
and
remained
there
until
grant
had
closed
the
window
again
then
and
not
till
then
did
the
murderer
strike
probably
stifling
her
with
his
free
hand
he
had
the
implement
in
his
pocket
the
rope
was
secreted
among
the
bushes
he
could
carry
through
the
whole
wretched
crime
in
little
more
than
a
minute
and
his
psychology
went
far
deeper
than
peters
gave
him
credit
for
he
had
weighed
up
the
situation
to
a
nicety
no
matter
who
found
the
body
grant
was
saddled
with
a
responsibility
which
might
well
prove
disastrous
and
was
almost
sure
to
affect
his
relations
with
the
martin
household
for
instance
nothing
short
of
a
miracle
could
have
stopped
robinson
from
arresting
him
on
a
charge
of
then
are
a
miracle
put
in
hart
pointing
the
pipe
at
the
little
man
the
person
of
ordinary
that
said
winter
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
see
who
secures
the
pocket
marvel
as
a
partner
at
as
a
fitting
end
to
the
strange
story
of
wayward
love
and
maniacal
frenzy
which
found
an
unusual
habitat
in
a
secluded
hamlet
like
steynholme
a
small
vignette
of
its
normal
life
may
be
etched
in
the
trope
is
germane
to
the
scene
on
a
wet
afternoon
in
october
hobbs
and
elkin
had
adjourned
to
the
hare
and
hounds
tomlin
was
reading
a
newspaper
spread
on
the
bar
counter
he
was
alone
the
day
was
friday
and
the
last
of
the
week
had
departed
by
the
train
yer
tonic
demanded
the
butcher
glass
of
beer
threw
elkin
over
his
shoulder
he
had
walked
to
the
window
and
was
gazing
moodily
at
the
sign
of
the
and
who
had
taken
shop
the
village
could
not
really
support
an
chemist
so
a
local
grocer
had
elected
to
stock
patent
medicines
as
a
side
line
tomlin
made
play
with
a
yer
own
inquired
hobbs
hospitably
elkin
came
and
drank
after
an
interlude
tomlin
ran
a
finger
down
a
column
of
the
newspaper
the
way
fred

me
about
that
funny
little
chap
furno
the
some
pictures
of
yours
he
said

had
him

chuckled
elkin
much
did

stick
for

lot
then
though
a
notion
it
wur
the
same

talking
about

turned
the
paper
and
elkin
read
at
their
monthly

almost
unique

various
phases
of
the
long
defunct
aylesbury
steeplechase
start
brook
and
so
on
to
it
is
understood
that
this
notable
series
produced
during
the
best
period
of
the
art
and
at
the
very
zenith
of
fame
were
acquired
recently
by
a
sussex
amateur
at
a
low
price
bidding

at
fifty
guineas
and
rose
quickly
to
one
hundred
and
twenty
at
which
figure
carnioli
and
bruschi
became
the
owners
elkin
read
the
paragraph
twice
until
the
words
burnt
into
his
brain
he
said
thickly
not
mine
no
such
luck
