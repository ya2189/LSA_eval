chapter
i
we
have
just
had
another
flood
bad
enough
but
only
a
foot
or
two
of
water
on
the
first
floor
yesterday
we
got
the
mud
shoveled
out
of
the
cellar
and
found
peter
the
spaniel
that
ladley
left
when
he
went
away
the
flood
and
the
fact
that
it
was
ladley
dog
whose
body
was
found
half
buried
in
the
basement
fruit
closet
brought
back
to
me
the
strange
events
of
the
other
flood
five
years
ago
when
the
water
reached
more
than
to
the
second
story
and
brought
with
it
to
some
mystery
and
sudden
death
and
to
me
the
worst
case
of
shingles
i
have
ever
seen
my
name
is
pitman
in
this
narrative
it
is
not
really
pitman
but
that
does
well
enough
i
belong
to
an
old
pittsburgh
family
i
was
born
on
penn
avenue
when
that
was
the
best
part
of
town
and
i
lived
until
i
was
fifteen
very
close
to
what
is
now
the
pittsburgh
club
it
was
a
dwelling
then
i
have
forgotten
who
lived
there
i
was
a
girl
in
during
the
railroad
riots
and
i
recall
our
driving
in
the
family
carriage
over
to
one
of
the
allegheny
hills
and
seeing
the
yards
burning
and
a
great
noise
of
shooting
from
across
the
river
it
was
the
next
year
that
i
ran
away
from
school
to
marry
pitman
and
i
have
not
known
my
family
since
we
were
never
reconciled
although
i
came
back
to
pittsburgh
after
twenty
years
of
wandering
pitman
was
dead
the
old
city
called
me
and
i
came
i
had
a
hundred
dollars
or
so
and
i
took
a
house
in
lower
allegheny
where
because
they
are
partly
inundated
every
spring
rents
are
cheap
and
i
kept
boarders
my
house
was
always
orderly
and
clean
and
although
the
neighborhood
had
a
bad
name
a
good
many
theatrical
people
stopped
with
me
five
minutes
across
the
bridge
and
they
were
in
the
theater
district
allegheny
at
that
time
i
believe
was
still
an
independent
city
but
since
then
it
has
allied
itself
with
pittsburgh
it
is
now
the
north
side
i
was
glad
to
get
back
i
worked
hard
but
i
made
my
rent
and
my
living
and
a
little
over
now
and
then
on
summer
evenings
i
went
to
one
of
the
parks
and
sitting
on
a
bench
watched
the
children
playing
around
and
looked
at
my
sister
house
closed
for
the
summer
it
is
a
very
large
house
her
butler
once
had
his
wife
boarding
with
me
a
nice
little
woman
it
is
curious
to
recall
that
at
that
time
five
years
ago
i
had
never
seen
my
niece
lida
harvey
and
then
to
think
that
only
the
day
before
yesterday
she
came
in
her
automobile
as
far
as
she
dared
and
then
sat
there
waving
to
me
while
the
police
patrol
brought
across
in
a
skiff
a
basket
of
provisions
she
had
sent
me
i
wonder
what
she
would
have
thought
had
she
known
that
the
elderly
woman
in
a
calico
wrapper
with
an
old
overcoat
over
it
and
a
pair
of
rubber
boots
was
her
full
aunt
the
flood
and
the
sight
of
lida
both
brought
back
the
case
of
jennie
brice
for
even
then
lida
and
howell
were
interested
in
each
other
this
is
april
the
flood
of
was
earlier
in
march
it
had
been
a
long
hard
winter
with
ice
gorges
in
all
the
upper
valley
then
in
early
march
there
came
a
thaw
the
gorges
broke
up
and
began
to
come
down
filling
the
rivers
with
crushing
grinding
ice
there
are
three
rivers
at
pittsburgh
the
allegheny
and
the
monongahela
uniting
there
at
the
point
to
form
the
ohio
and
all
three
were
covered
with
broken
ice
logs
and
all
sorts
of
debris
from
the
upper
valleys
a
warning
was
sent
out
from
the
weather
bureau
and
i
got
my
carpets
ready
to
lift
that
morning
that
was
on
the
fourth
of
march
a
sunday
ladley
and
his
wife
jennie
brice
had
the
parlor
bedroom
and
the
room
behind
it
ladley
or
miss
brice
as
she
preferred
to
be
known
had
a
small
part
at
a
local
theater
that
kept
a
permanent
company
her
husband
was
in
that
business
too
but
he
had
nothing
to
do
it
was
the
wife
who
paid
the
bills
and
a
lot
of
quarreling
they
did
about
it
i
knocked
at
the
door
at
ten
and
ladley
opened
it
he
was
a
short
man
rather
stout
and
getting
bald
and
he
always
had
a
cigarette
even
yet
the
parlor
carpet
smells
of
them
what
do
you
want
he
asked
sharply
holding
the
door
open
about
an
inch
the
water
coming
up
very
fast
ladley
i
said
it
up
to
the
in
the
cellar
now
i
like
to
take
up
the
carpet
and
move
the
piano
come
back
in
an
hour
or
so
he
snapped
and
tried
to
close
the
door
but
i
had
got
my
toe
in
the
crack
i
have
to
have
the
piano
moved
ladley
i
said
you
better
put
off
what
you
are
doing
i
thought
he
was
probably
writing
he
spent
most
of
the
day
writing
using
the
as
a
desk
and
it
kept
me
busy
with
oxalic
acid
taking
out
of
the
splasher
and
the
towels
he
was
writing
a
play
and
talked
a
lot
about
the
shuberts
having
promised
to
star
him
in
it
when
it
was
finished
hell
he
said
and
turning
spoke
to
somebody
in
the
room
we
can
go
into
the
back
room
i
heard
him
say
and
he
closed
the
door
when
he
opened
it
again
the
room
was
empty
i
called
in
terry
the
irishman
who
does
odd
jobs
for
me
now
and
then
and
we
both
got
to
work
at
the
tacks
in
the
carpet
terry
working
by
the
window
and
i
by
the
door
into
the
back
parlor
which
the
ladleys
used
as
a
bedroom
that
was
how
i
happened
to
hear
what
i
afterward
told
the
police
some
one
a
man
but
not
ladley
was
talking
ladley
broke
in
i
wo
do
it
she
said
flatly
why
should
i
help
him
he
does
help
me
he
loafs
here
all
day
smoking
and
sleeping
and
sits
up
all
night
drinking
and
keeping
me
awake
the
voice
went
on
again
as
if
in
reply
to
this
and
i
heard
a
rattle
of
glasses
as
if
they
were
pouring
drinks
they
always
had
whisky
even
when
they
were
behind
with
their
board
that
all
very
well
ladley
said
i
could
always
hear
her
she
having
a
theatrical
sort
of
voice
one
that
carries
but
what
about
the
prying
that
runs
the
house
hush
for
god
sake
broke
in
ladley
and
after
that
they
spoke
in
whispers
even
with
my
ear
against
the
panel
i
could
not
catch
a
word
the
men
came
just
then
to
move
the
piano
and
by
the
time
we
had
taken
it
and
the
furniture
the
water
was
over
the
kitchen
floor
and
creeping
forward
into
the
hall
i
had
never
seen
the
river
come
up
so
fast
by
noon
the
yard
was
full
of
floating
ice
and
at
three
that
afternoon
the
police
skiff
was
on
the
front
street
and
i
was
wading
around
in
rubber
boots
taking
the
pictures
off
the
walls
i
was
too
busy
to
see
who
the
ladleys
visitor
was
and
he
had
gone
when
i
remembered
him
again
the
ladleys
took
the
front
which
was
empty
and
reynolds
who
was
in
the
silk
department
in
a
store
across
the
river
had
the
room
just
behind
i
put
up
a
coal
stove
in
a
back
room
next
the
bathroom
and
managed
to
cook
the
dinner
there
i
was
washing
up
the
dishes
when
reynolds
came
in
as
it
was
sunday
he
was
in
his
slippers
and
had
the
colored
supplement
of
a
morning
paper
in
his
hand
what
the
matter
with
the
ladleys
he
asked
i
ca
read
for
their
quarreling
booze
probably
i
said
when
you
lived
in
the
flood
district
as
long
as
i
have
reynolds
you
know
that
the
rising
of
the
river
is
a
signal
for
every
man
in
the
vicinity
to
stop
work
and
get
full
the
fuller
the
river
the
fuller
the
male
population
then
this
flood
will
likely
make
drink
themselves
to
death
he
said
it
a
lulu
it
the
neighborhood
annual
debauch
the
women
are
busy
keeping
the
babies
from
getting
drowned
in
the
cellars
or
they
get
full
too
i
hope
since
it
come
this
far
it
will
come
farther
so
the
landlord
will
have
to
paper
the
parlor
that
was
at
three
at
four
ladley
went
down
the
stairs
and
i
heard
him
getting
into
a
skiff
in
the
lower
hall
there
were
boats
going
back
and
forth
all
the
time
carrying
crowds
of
curious
people
and
taking
the
flood
sufferers
to
the
corner
grocery
where
they
were
lowering
groceries
in
a
basket
on
a
rope
from
an
upper
window
i
had
been
making
tea
when
i
heard
ladley
go
out
i
fixed
a
tray
with
a
cup
of
it
and
some
crackers
and
took
it
to
their
door
i
had
never
liked
ladley
but
it
was
chilly
in
the
house
with
the
gas
shut
off
and
the
lower
floor
full
of
and
it
is
hard
enough
to
keep
boarders
in
the
flood
district
she
did
not
answer
to
my
knock
so
i
opened
the
door
and
went
in
she
was
at
the
window
looking
after
him
and
the
brown
valise
that
figured
in
the
case
later
was
opened
on
the
floor
over
the
foot
of
the
bed
was
the
black
and
white
dress
with
the
red
collar
when
i
spoke
to
her
she
turned
around
quickly
she
was
a
tall
woman
about
with
very
white
teeth
and
yellow
hair
which
she
parted
a
little
to
one
side
and
drew
down
over
her
ears
she
had
a
sullen
face
and
large
hands
with
her
nails
long
and
very
pointed
the
has
brought
you
some
tea
i
said
where
shall
she
put
it
she
repeated
raising
her
eyebrows
it
a
very
thoughtful
who
called
you
that
but
with
the
sight
of
the
valise
and
the
fear
that
they
might
be
leaving
i
thought
it
best
not
to
quarrel
she
had
left
the
window
and
going
to
her
had
picked
up
her
never
mind
i
said
i
hope
you
are
not
going
away
these
floods
do
last
and
they
a
benefit
plenty
of
the
people
around
here
rely
on
every
year
to
wash
out
their
cellars
no
i
not
going
away
she
replied
lazily
i
taking
that
dress
to
miss
hope
at
the
theater
she
is
going
to
wear
it
in
next
week
she
has
half
enough
of
a
wardrobe
to
play
leads
in
stock
look
at
this
broken
to
the
quick
if
i
had
only
looked
to
see
which
thumb
it
was
but
i
was
putting
the
on
the
and
moving
ladley
papers
to
find
room
for
it
peter
the
spaniel
begged
for
a
lump
of
sugar
and
i
gave
it
to
him
where
is
mr
ladley
i
asked
gone
out
to
see
the
river
i
hope
he
be
careful
there
a
drowning
or
two
every
year
in
these
floods
then
i
hope
he
wo
she
said
calmly
do
you
know
what
i
was
doing
when
you
came
in
i
was
looking
after
his
boat
and
hoping
it
had
a
hole
in
it
you
wo
feel
that
way
ladley
i
protested
shocked
you
just
nervous
and
put
out
most
men
have
their
ugly
times
many
a
time
i
wished
pitman
was
gone
until
he
went
then
i
have
given
a
good
bit
to
have
him
back
again
she
was
standing
in
front
of
the
dresser
fixing
her
hair
over
her
ears
she
turned
and
looked
at
me
over
her
shoulder
probably
pitman
was
a
man
she
said
my
husband
is
a
fiend
a
devil
well
a
good
many
women
have
said
that
to
me
at
different
times
but
just
let
me
say
such
a
thing
to
or
repeat
their
own
words
to
them
the
next
day
and
they
would
fly
at
me
in
a
fury
so
i
said
nothing
and
put
the
cream
into
her
tea
i
never
saw
her
again
chapter
ii
there
is
not
much
sleeping
done
in
the
flood
district
during
a
spring
flood
the
gas
was
shut
off
and
i
gave
reynolds
and
the
ladleys
each
a
lamp
i
sat
in
the
back
room
that
i
had
made
into
a
temporary
kitchen
with
a
candle
and
with
a
bedquilt
around
my
shoulders
the
water
rose
fast
in
the
lower
hall
but
by
midnight
at
the
seventh
step
it
stopped
rising
and
stood
still
i
always
have
a
skiff
during
the
flood
season
and
as
the
water
rose
i
tied
it
to
one
spindle
of
the
staircase
after
another
i
made
myself
a
cup
of
tea
and
at
one
i
stretched
out
on
a
sofa
for
a
few
hours
sleep
i
think
i
had
been
sleeping
only
an
hour
or
so
when
some
one
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
and
i
started
up
it
was
reynolds
partly
dressed
some
one
has
been
in
the
house
pitman
he
said
they
went
away
just
now
in
the
boat
perhaps
it
was
peter
i
suggested
that
dog
is
always
wandering
around
at
night
not
unless
peter
can
row
a
boat
said
reynolds
dryly
i
got
up
being
already
fully
dressed
and
taking
the
candle
we
went
to
the
staircase
i
noticed
that
it
was
a
minute
or
so
after
two
as
we
left
the
room
the
boat
was
gone
not
untied
but
cut
loose
the
end
of
the
rope
was
still
fastened
to
the
i
sat
down
on
the
stairs
and
looked
at
reynolds
it
gone
i
said
if
the
house
catches
fire
we
have
to
drown
it
rather
curious
when
you
consider
it
we
both
spoke
softly
not
to
disturb
the
ladleys
i
been
awake
and
i
heard
no
boat
come
in
and
yet
if
no
one
came
in
a
boat
and
came
from
the
street
they
would
have
had
to
swim
in
i
felt
queer
and
creepy
the
street
door
was
open
of
course
and
the
lights
going
beyond
it
gave
me
a
strange
feeling
to
sit
there
in
the
darkness
on
the
stairs
with
the
arch
of
the
front
door
like
the
entrance
to
a
cavern
and
see
now
and
then
a
chunk
of
ice
slide
into
view
turn
around
in
the
eddy
and
pass
on
it
was
bitter
cold
too
and
the
wind
was
rising
i
go
through
the
house
said
reynolds
there
likely
nothing
worse
the
matter
than
some
drunken
on
a
vacation
while
the
mills
are
under
water
but
i
better
look
he
left
me
and
i
sat
there
alone
in
the
darkness
i
had
a
presentiment
of
something
wrong
but
i
tried
to
think
it
was
only
discomfort
and
the
cold
the
water
driven
in
by
the
wind
swirled
at
my
feet
and
something
dark
floated
in
and
lodged
on
the
step
below
i
reached
down
and
touched
it
it
was
a
dead
kitten
i
had
never
known
a
dead
cat
to
bring
me
anything
but
bad
luck
and
here
was
one
washed
in
at
my
very
feet
reynolds
came
back
soon
and
reported
the
house
quiet
and
in
order
but
i
found
peter
shut
up
in
one
of
the
rooms
he
said
did
you
put
him
there
i
had
not
and
said
so
but
as
the
dog
went
everywhere
and
the
door
might
have
blown
shut
we
did
not
attach
much
importance
to
that
at
the
time
well
the
skiff
was
gone
and
there
was
no
use
worrying
about
it
until
morning
i
went
back
to
the
sofa
to
keep
warm
but
i
left
my
candle
lighted
and
my
door
open
i
did
not
sleep
the
dead
cat
was
on
my
mind
and
as
if
it
were
not
bad
enough
to
have
it
washed
in
at
my
feet
about
four
in
the
morning
peter
prowling
uneasily
discovered
it
and
brought
it
in
and
put
it
on
my
couch
wet
and
stiff
poor
little
thing
i
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
a
quarter
after
four
and
except
for
the
occasional
crunch
of
one
hitting
another
in
the
yard
everything
was
quiet
and
then
i
heard
the
stealthy
sound
of
oars
in
the
lower
hall
i
am
not
a
brave
woman
i
lay
there
hoping
reynolds
would
hear
and
open
his
door
but
he
was
sleeping
soundly
peter
snarled
and
ran
out
into
the
hall
and
the
next
moment
i
heard
ladley
speaking
down
peter
he
said
down
go
and
lie
down
i
took
my
candle
and
went
out
into
the
hall
ladley
was
stooping
over
the
boat
trying
to
tie
it
to
the
staircase
the
rope
was
short
having
been
cut
and
he
was
having
trouble
perhaps
it
was
the
but
he
looked
and
haggard
i
borrowed
your
boat
pitman
he
said
civilly
enough
ladley
was
not
well
and
i
i
went
to
the
drug
store
you
been
more
than
two
hours
going
to
the
drug
store
i
said
he
muttered
something
about
not
finding
any
open
at
first
and
went
into
his
room
he
closed
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
and
although
peter
whined
and
scratched
he
did
not
let
him
in
he
looked
so
agitated
that
i
thought
i
had
been
harsh
and
that
perhaps
she
was
really
ill
i
knocked
at
the
door
and
asked
if
i
could
do
anything
but
he
only
called
no
curtly
through
the
door
and
asked
me
to
take
that
infernal
dog
away
i
went
back
to
bed
and
tried
to
sleep
for
the
water
had
dropped
an
inch
or
so
on
the
stairs
and
i
knew
the
danger
was
over
peter
came
shivering
at
dawn
and
got
on
to
the
sofa
with
me
i
put
an
end
of
the
quilt
over
him
and
he
stopped
shivering
after
a
time
and
went
to
sleep
the
dog
was
company
i
lay
there
wide
awake
thinking
about
pitman
death
and
how
i
had
come
by
degrees
to
be
keeping
a
cheap
in
the
flood
district
and
to
having
to
take
impudence
from
everybody
who
chose
to
rent
a
room
from
me
and
to
being
called
a
from
that
i
got
to
thinking
again
about
the
ladleys
and
how
she
had
said
he
was
a
fiend
and
to
doubting
about
his
having
gone
out
for
medicine
for
her
i
dozed
off
again
at
daylight
and
being
worn
out
i
slept
heavily
at
seven
reynolds
came
to
the
door
dressed
for
the
store
he
was
a
tall
man
of
about
fifty
neat
and
orderly
in
his
habits
and
he
always
remembered
that
i
had
seen
better
days
and
treated
me
as
a
lady
never
mind
about
breakfast
for
me
this
morning
pitman
he
said
i
get
a
cup
of
coffee
at
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
take
the
boat
and
send
it
back
with
terry
he
turned
and
went
along
the
hall
and
down
to
the
boat
i
heard
him
push
off
from
the
stairs
with
an
oar
and
row
out
into
the
street
peter
followed
him
to
the
stairs
at
a
quarter
after
seven
ladley
came
out
and
called
to
me
just
bring
in
a
cup
of
coffee
and
some
toast
he
said
enough
for
one
he
went
back
and
slammed
his
door
and
i
made
his
coffee
i
steeped
a
cup
of
tea
for
ladley
at
the
same
time
he
opened
the
door
just
wide
enough
for
the
tray
and
took
it
without
so
much
as
a
thank
you
he
had
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
as
usual
and
i
could
see
a
fire
in
the
grate
and
smell
something
like
scorching
cloth
i
hope
ladley
is
better
i
said
getting
my
foot
in
the
crack
of
the
door
so
he
could
not
quite
close
it
it
smelled
to
me
as
if
he
had
accidentally
set
fire
to
something
with
his
cigarette
and
i
tried
to
see
into
the
room
what
about
mrs
ladley
he
snapped
you
said
she
was
ill
last
night
oh
yes
well
she
was
very
sick
she
better
shall
i
bring
her
some
tea
take
your
foot
away
he
ordered
no
she
does
want
tea
not
here
not
here
good
heavens
he
snarled
is
her
going
away
anything
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
the
lord
knows
i
be
glad
to
get
out
of
this
infernal
myself
if
you
mean
my
house
i
began
but
he
had
pulled
himself
together
and
was
more
polite
when
he
answered
i
mean
the
neighborhood
your
house
is
all
that
could
be
desired
for
the
money
if
we
do
not
have
linen
sheets
and
double
cream
we
are
paying
muslin
and
milk
prices
either
my
nose
was
growing
accustomed
to
the
odor
or
it
was
dying
away
i
took
my
foot
away
from
the
door
when
did
ladley
leave
i
asked
this
morning
very
early
i
rowed
her
to
federal
street
you
could
have
had
much
sleep
i
said
dryly
for
he
looked
horrible
there
were
lines
around
his
eyes
which
were
red
and
his
lips
looked
dry
and
cracked
she
not
in
the
piece
this
week
at
the
theater
he
said
licking
his
lips
and
looking
past
me
not
at
me
she
be
back
by
saturday
i
did
not
believe
him
i
do
not
think
he
imagined
that
i
did
he
shut
the
door
in
my
face
and
it
caught
poor
peter
by
the
nose
the
dog
ran
off
howling
but
although
ladley
had
been
as
fond
of
the
animal
as
it
was
in
his
nature
to
be
fond
of
anything
he
paid
no
attention
as
i
started
down
the
hall
after
him
i
saw
what
peter
had
been
carrying
a
slipper
of
ladley
it
was
soaked
with
water
evidently
peter
had
found
it
floating
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
although
the
idea
of
murder
had
not
entered
my
head
at
that
time
the
slipper
gave
me
a
turn
i
picked
it
up
and
looked
at
it
a
black
one
with
a
beaded
toe
short
in
the
vamp
and
the
sort
most
actresses
wear
then
i
went
back
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
front
room
again
what
the
devil
do
you
want
now
he
called
from
beyond
the
door
here
a
slipper
of
ladley
i
said
peter
found
it
floating
in
the
lower
hall
he
opened
the
door
wide
and
let
me
in
the
room
was
in
tolerable
order
much
better
than
when
ladley
was
about
he
looked
at
the
slipper
but
he
did
not
touch
it
i
do
think
that
is
hers
he
said
i
seen
her
wear
it
a
hundred
times
well
she
never
wear
it
again
and
then
seeing
me
stare
he
added
it
ruined
with
the
water
throw
it
out
and
by
the
way
sorry
but
i
set
fire
to
one
of
the
dropped
asleep
and
my
cigarette
did
the
rest
just
put
it
on
the
bill
he
pointed
to
the
bed
one
of
the
pillows
had
no
slip
and
the
ticking
cover
had
a
scorch
or
two
on
it
i
went
over
and
looked
at
it
the
pillow
will
have
to
be
paid
for
too
ladley
i
said
and
there
a
sign
nailed
on
the
door
that
forbids
smoking
in
bed
if
you
are
going
to
set
fire
to
things
i
shall
have
to
charge
extra
really
he
jeered
looking
at
me
with
his
cold
fishy
eyes
is
there
any
sign
on
the
door
saying
that
boarders
are
charged
extra
for
seven
feet
of
filthy
river
in
the
bedrooms
i
was
never
a
match
for
him
and
i
make
it
a
principle
never
to
bandy
words
with
my
boarders
i
took
the
pillow
and
the
slipper
and
went
out
the
telephone
was
ringing
on
the
stair
landing
it
was
the
theater
asking
for
miss
brice
she
has
gone
away
i
said
what
do
you
mean
moved
away
gone
for
a
few
days
vacation
i
replied
she
is
playing
this
week
is
she
wait
a
moment
said
the
voice
there
was
a
hum
of
conversation
from
the
other
end
and
then
another
man
came
to
the
telephone
can
you
find
out
where
miss
brice
has
gone
i
see
i
went
to
ladley
door
and
knocked
ladley
answered
from
just
beyond
the
theater
is
asking
where
ladley
is
tell
them
i
do
know
he
snarled
and
shut
the
door
i
took
his
message
to
the
telephone
whoever
it
was
swore
and
hung
up
the
receiver
all
the
morning
i
was
uneasy
i
hardly
knew
why
peter
felt
it
as
i
did
there
was
no
sound
from
the
ladleys
room
and
the
house
was
quiet
except
for
the
lapping
water
on
the
stairs
and
the
police
patrol
going
back
and
forth
at
eleven
a
boy
in
the
neighborhood
paddling
on
a
raft
fell
into
the
water
and
was
drowned
i
watched
the
police
boat
go
past
carrying
his
little
cold
body
and
after
that
i
was
good
for
nothing
i
went
and
sat
with
peter
on
the
stairs
the
dog
conduct
had
been
strange
all
morning
he
had
sat
just
above
the
water
looking
at
it
and
whimpering
perhaps
he
was
expecting
another
kitten
or
it
is
hard
to
say
how
ideas
first
enter
one
mind
but
the
notion
that
ladley
had
killed
his
wife
and
thrown
her
body
into
the
water
came
to
me
as
i
sat
there
all
at
once
i
seemed
to
see
it
all
the
quarreling
the
day
before
the
night
trip
in
the
boat
the
slipper
his
haggard
face
that
morning
even
the
way
the
spaniel
sat
and
stared
at
the
flood
terry
brought
the
boat
back
at
half
past
eleven
towing
it
behind
another
well
i
said
from
the
stairs
i
hope
you
had
a
pleasant
morning
what
doing
he
asked
not
looking
at
me
rowing
about
the
streets
you
had
that
boat
for
hours
he
tied
it
up
without
a
word
to
me
but
he
spoke
to
the
dog
good
morning
peter
he
said
it
nice
weather
for
fishes
ai
it
he
picked
out
a
bit
of
floating
wood
from
the
water
and
showing
it
to
the
dog
flung
it
into
the
parlor
peter
went
after
it
with
a
splash
he
was
pretty
fat
and
when
he
came
back
i
heard
him
wheezing
but
what
he
brought
back
was
not
the
stick
of
wood
it
was
the
knife
i
use
for
cutting
bread
it
had
been
on
a
shelf
in
the
room
where
i
had
slept
the
night
before
and
now
peter
brought
it
out
of
the
flood
where
its
wooden
handle
had
kept
it
afloat
the
blade
was
broken
off
short
it
is
not
unusual
to
find
one
household
goods
floating
around
during
more
than
once
i
lost
a
chair
or
two
and
seen
it
after
the
water
had
gone
down
new
scrubbed
and
painted
in
molly
kitchen
next
door
and
perhaps
now
and
then
a
bit
of
luck
would
come
to
me
a
dog
kennel
or
a
or
a
kitchen
table
or
even
as
happened
once
a
baby
in
a
wooden
cradle
that
lodged
against
my
back
fence
and
had
come
forty
miles
as
it
turned
out
with
no
worse
mishap
than
a
cold
in
its
head
but
the
knife
was
different
i
had
put
it
on
the
mantel
over
the
stove
i
was
using
the
night
before
and
had
touched
it
since
as
i
sat
staring
at
it
terry
took
it
from
peter
and
handed
it
to
me
better
give
me
a
penny
pitman
he
said
in
his
impudent
irish
way
i
hate
to
give
you
a
knife
it
may
cut
our
friendship
i
reached
over
to
hit
him
a
clout
on
the
head
but
i
did
not
the
sunlight
was
coming
in
through
the
window
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
shining
on
the
rope
that
was
tied
to
the
banister
the
end
of
the
rope
was
covered
with
stains
brown
with
a
glint
of
red
in
them
i
got
up
shivering
you
can
get
the
meat
at
the
butcher
terry
i
said
and
come
back
for
me
in
a
then
i
turned
and
went
weak
in
the
knees
to
put
on
my
hat
and
coat
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
there
had
been
murder
done
chapter
iii
i
looked
at
my
clock
as
i
went
it
was
just
i
thought
of
telephoning
for
reynolds
to
meet
me
but
it
was
his
lunch
hour
and
besides
i
was
afraid
to
telephone
from
the
house
while
ladley
was
in
it
peter
had
been
whining
again
when
i
came
down
the
stairs
he
had
stopped
whimpering
and
was
wagging
his
tail
a
strange
boat
had
put
into
the
hallway
and
was
coming
back
now
old
boy
somebody
was
saying
from
the
boat
steady
old
chap
i
got
something
for
you
a
little
man
elderly
and
alert
was
standing
up
in
the
boat
poling
it
along
with
an
oar
peter
gave
vent
to
joyful
yelps
the
elderly
gentleman
brought
his
boat
to
a
stop
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
reaching
down
into
a
tub
at
his
feet
held
up
a
large
piece
of
raw
liver
peter
almost
went
crazy
and
i
remembered
suddenly
that
i
had
forgotten
to
feed
the
poor
beast
for
more
than
a
day
would
you
like
it
asked
the
gentleman
peter
sat
up
as
he
had
been
taught
to
do
and
barked
the
gentleman
reached
down
again
got
a
wooden
platter
from
a
stack
of
them
at
his
feet
and
placing
the
liver
on
it
put
it
on
the
step
the
whole
thing
was
so
neat
and
businesslike
that
i
could
only
gaze
that
a
dog
madam
said
the
elderly
gentleman
beaming
at
peter
over
his
glasses
you
should
not
have
neglected
him
the
flood
put
him
out
of
my
mind
i
explained
humbly
enough
for
i
was
ashamed
exactly
do
you
know
how
many
starving
dogs
and
cats
i
have
found
this
morning
he
took
a
out
of
his
pocket
and
glanced
at
it
madam
and
cats
i
have
found
them
marooned
in
trees
clinging
to
fences
floating
on
barrels
and
i
have
found
them
in
comfortable
houses
where
there
was
no
excuse
for
their
neglect
well
i
must
be
moving
on
i
have
the
report
of
a
cat
with
a
new
litter
in
the
loft
of
a
stable
near
here
he
wiped
his
hands
carefully
on
a
fresh
paper
napkin
of
which
also
a
heap
rested
on
one
of
the
seats
of
the
boat
and
picked
up
an
oar
smiling
benevolently
at
peter
then
suddenly
he
bent
over
and
looked
at
the
stained
rope
end
tied
to
the
what
that
he
said
that
what
i
going
to
find
out
i
replied
i
glanced
up
at
the
ladleys
door
but
it
was
closed
the
little
man
dropped
his
oar
and
fumbling
in
his
pockets
pulled
out
a
small
he
bent
over
holding
to
the
rail
and
inspected
the
stains
with
the
glass
i
had
taken
a
fancy
to
him
at
once
and
in
spite
of
my
excitement
i
had
to
smile
a
little
humph
he
said
and
looked
up
at
me
that
blood
why
did
you
the
boat
loose
i
did
i
said
if
that
is
blood
i
want
to
know
how
it
got
there
that
was
a
new
rope
last
night
i
glanced
at
the
ladleys
door
again
and
he
followed
my
eyes
i
wonder
he
said
raising
his
voice
a
little
if
i
come
into
your
kitchen
if
you
will
allow
me
to
fry
a
little
of
that
liver
there
a
wretched
maltese
in
a
tree
at
the
corner
of
fourth
street
that
touch
it
raw
i
saw
that
he
wanted
to
talk
to
me
so
i
turned
around
and
led
the
way
to
the
temporary
kitchen
i
had
made
now
he
said
briskly
when
he
had
closed
the
door
something
wrong
here
perhaps
if
you
tell
me
i
can
help
if
i
ca
it
will
do
you
good
to
talk
about
it
my
name
holcombe
retired
merchant
apply
to
first
national
bank
for
references
i
not
sure
there
anything
wrong
i
began
i
guess
i
only
nervous
and
thinking
little
things
are
big
ones
there
nothing
to
tell
nonsense
i
come
down
the
street
in
my
boat
a
gentleman
with
a
cigarette
looks
out
from
a
window
when
i
stop
at
the
door
and
ducks
back
when
i
glance
up
i
come
in
and
find
a
pet
dog
obviously
overfed
at
ordinary
times
whining
with
hunger
on
the
stairs
as
i
prepare
to
feed
him
a
pale
woman
comes
down
trying
to
put
a
glove
on
her
left
hand
and
with
her
jacket
wrong
side
out
what
am
i
to
think
i
started
and
looked
at
my
coat
he
was
right
and
when
as
i
tried
to
take
it
off
he
helped
me
and
even
patted
me
on
the
shoulder
what
with
his
kindness
and
the
long
morning
alone
worrying
and
the
sleepless
night
i
began
to
cry
he
had
a
clean
handkerchief
in
my
hand
before
i
had
time
to
think
of
one
that
it
he
said
it
will
do
you
good
only
do
make
a
noise
about
it
if
it
a
husband
on
the
annual
flood
spree
do
worry
madam
they
always
come
around
in
time
to
whitewash
the
cellars
it
is
a
husband
i
sniffled
tell
me
about
it
he
said
there
was
something
so
kindly
in
his
face
and
it
was
so
long
since
i
had
had
a
bit
of
human
sympathy
that
i
almost
broke
down
again
i
sat
there
with
a
crowd
of
children
paddling
on
a
raft
outside
the
window
and
molly
maguire
next
door
hauling
the
morning
milk
up
in
a
pail
fastened
to
a
rope
her
doorway
being
too
narrow
to
admit
the
milkman
boat
and
i
told
him
the
whole
story
humph
he
exclaimed
when
i
had
finished
it
curious
but
you
ca
prove
a
murder
unless
you
can
produce
a
body
when
the
river
goes
down
we
find
the
body
i
said
shivering
it
in
the
parlor
then
why
does
he
try
to
get
away
he
is
ready
to
go
now
he
only
went
back
when
your
boat
came
in
holcombe
ran
to
the
door
and
flinging
it
open
peered
into
the
lower
hall
he
was
too
late
his
boat
was
gone
tub
of
liver
pile
of
wooden
platters
and
all
we
hurried
to
the
room
the
ladleys
had
occupied
it
was
empty
from
the
window
as
we
looked
out
we
could
see
the
boat
almost
a
square
away
it
had
stopped
where
the
street
being
higher
a
rose
above
the
flood
on
the
step
was
sitting
a
forlorn
yellow
puppy
as
we
stared
ladley
stopped
the
boat
looked
back
at
us
bent
over
placed
a
piece
of
liver
on
a
platter
and
reached
it
over
to
the
dog
then
rising
in
the
boat
he
bowed
with
his
hat
over
his
heart
in
our
direction
sat
down
calmly
and
rowed
around
the
corner
out
of
sight
holcombe
was
in
a
frenzy
of
rage
he
jumped
up
and
down
shaking
his
fist
out
the
window
after
the
retreating
boat
he
ran
down
the
staircase
only
to
come
back
and
look
out
the
window
again
the
police
boat
was
not
in
sight
but
the
maguire
children
had
worked
their
raft
around
to
the
street
and
were
under
the
window
he
leaned
out
and
called
to
them
a
quarter
each
boys
he
said
if
you
take
me
on
that
raft
to
the
nearest
pavement
money
first
said
the
oldest
boy
holding
his
cap
but
holcombe
did
not
wait
he
swung
out
over
the
holding
by
his
hands
and
lit
fairly
in
the
center
of
the
raft
do
touch
anything
in
that
room
until
i
come
back
he
called
to
me
and
jerking
the
pole
from
one
of
the
boys
propelled
the
raft
with
amazing
speed
down
the
street
the
liver
on
the
stove
was
burning
there
was
a
smell
of
scorching
through
the
rooms
and
a
sort
of
bluish
haze
of
smoke
i
hurried
back
and
took
it
off
by
the
time
i
had
cleaned
the
pan
holcombe
was
back
again
in
his
own
boat
he
had
found
it
at
the
end
of
the
next
street
where
the
flood
ceased
but
no
sign
of
ladley
anywhere
he
had
not
seen
the
police
boat
perhaps
that
is
just
as
well
he
said
philosophically
we
ca
go
to
the
police
with
a
wet
slipper
and
a
rope
and
accuse
a
man
of
murder
we
have
to
have
a
body
he
killed
her
i
said
obstinately
she
told
me
yesterday
he
was
a
fiend
he
killed
her
and
threw
the
body
in
the
water
very
likely
but
he
did
throw
it
here
but
in
spite
of
that
he
went
over
all
the
lower
hall
with
his
boat
feeling
every
foot
of
the
floor
with
an
oar
and
finally
at
the
back
end
he
looked
up
at
me
as
i
stood
on
the
stairs
there
something
here
he
said
i
went
cold
all
over
and
had
to
clutch
the
railing
but
when
terry
had
come
and
the
two
of
them
brought
the
thing
to
the
surface
it
was
only
the
rug
which
i
had
rolled
up
and
forgotten
to
carry
at
half
past
one
holcombe
wrote
a
note
and
sent
it
off
with
terry
and
borrowing
my
boots
which
had
been
pitman
investigated
the
and
kitchen
from
a
floating
plank
the
doors
were
too
narrow
to
admit
the
boat
but
he
found
nothing
more
important
than
a
he
was
not
at
all
depressed
by
his
failure
he
came
back
drenched
to
the
skin
about
three
and
asked
permission
to
search
the
ladleys
bedroom
i
have
a
friend
coming
pretty
soon
pitman
he
said
a
young
newspaper
man
named
howell
he
a
nice
boy
and
if
there
is
anything
to
this
i
like
him
to
have
it
for
his
paper
he
and
i
have
been
having
some
arguments
about
circumstantial
evidence
too
and
i
know
he
like
to
work
on
this
i
gave
him
a
pair
of
pitman
socks
for
his
own
were
saturated
and
while
he
was
changing
them
the
telephone
rang
it
was
the
theater
again
asking
for
jennie
brice
you
are
certain
she
is
out
of
the
city
some
one
asked
the
same
voice
as
in
the
morning
her
husband
says
so
ask
him
to
come
to
the
phone
he
is
not
here
when
do
you
expect
him
back
i
not
sure
he
is
coming
back
look
here
said
the
voice
angrily
ca
you
give
me
any
satisfaction
or
do
you
care
to
i
told
you
all
i
know
you
do
know
where
she
is
no
sir
she
did
say
she
was
coming
back
to
rehearse
for
next
piece
her
husband
said
she
went
away
for
a
few
days
rest
he
went
away
about
noon
and
has
come
back
that
all
i
know
except
that
they
owe
me
three
weeks
rent
that
i
like
to
get
hold
of
the
owner
of
the
voice
hung
up
the
receiver
with
a
snap
and
left
me
pondering
it
seemed
to
me
that
ladley
had
been
very
reckless
did
he
expect
any
one
to
believe
that
jennie
brice
had
gone
for
a
vacation
without
notifying
the
theater
especially
when
she
was
to
rehearse
that
week
i
thought
it
curious
to
say
the
least
i
went
back
and
told
holcombe
who
put
it
down
in
his
and
together
we
went
to
the
ladleys
room
the
room
was
in
better
order
than
usual
as
i
have
said
the
bed
was
made
which
was
out
of
the
ordinary
for
jennie
brice
never
made
a
bed
but
made
the
way
a
man
makes
one
with
the
blankets
wrinkled
and
crooked
beneath
and
the
white
counterpane
pulled
smoothly
over
the
top
showing
every
lump
beneath
i
showed
holcombe
the
splasher
dotted
with
ink
as
usual
i
take
it
off
and
soak
it
in
milk
i
said
it
his
fountain
pen
when
the
ink
does
run
he
shakes
it
and
where
the
clock
said
holcombe
stopping
in
front
of
the
mantel
with
his
in
his
hand
the
clock
i
turned
and
looked
my
onyx
clock
was
gone
from
the
perhaps
it
seems
strange
but
from
the
moment
i
missed
that
clock
my
rage
at
ladley
increased
to
a
fury
it
was
all
i
had
had
left
of
my
former
gentility
when
times
were
hard
and
i
got
behind
with
the
rent
as
happened
now
and
then
more
than
once
i
been
tempted
to
sell
the
clock
or
to
pawn
it
but
i
had
never
done
it
its
ticking
had
kept
me
company
on
many
a
lonely
night
and
its
elegance
had
helped
me
to
keep
my
pride
and
to
retain
the
respect
of
my
neighbors
for
in
the
flood
district
onyx
clocks
are
not
plentiful
bryan
the
wife
had
one
and
i
had
another
that
is
i
had
i
stood
staring
at
the
mark
in
the
dust
of
the
which
holcombe
was
measuring
with
a
pocket
you
are
sure
you
did
take
it
away
yourself
mrs
pitman
he
asked
sure
why
i
could
hardly
lift
it
i
said
he
was
looking
carefully
at
the
oblong
of
dust
where
the
clock
had
stood
the
key
is
gone
too
he
said
busily
making
entries
in
his
what
was
the
maker
name
why
i
do
think
i
ever
noticed
he
turned
to
me
angrily
why
did
you
notice
he
snapped
good
god
woman
do
you
only
use
your
eyes
to
cry
with
how
can
you
wind
a
clock
time
after
time
and
not
know
the
maker
name
it
proves
my
contention
the
average
witness
is
totally
unreliable
not
at
all
i
snapped
i
am
ordinarily
both
accurate
and
observing
indeed
he
said
putting
his
hands
behind
him
then
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
the
color
of
the
pencil
i
have
been
writing
with
certainly
red
most
pencils
are
red
and
i
thought
this
was
safe
but
he
held
his
right
hand
out
with
a
flourish
i
been
writing
with
a
fountain
pen
he
said
in
deep
disgust
and
turned
his
back
on
me
but
the
next
moment
he
had
run
to
the
and
pulled
it
out
from
the
wall
behind
it
where
it
had
fallen
lay
a
towel
covered
with
stains
as
if
some
one
had
wiped
bloody
hands
on
it
he
held
it
up
his
face
working
with
excitement
i
could
only
cover
my
eyes
this
looks
better
he
said
and
began
making
a
quick
search
of
the
room
running
from
one
piece
of
furniture
to
another
pulling
out
bureau
drawers
drawing
the
bed
out
from
the
wall
and
crawling
along
the
with
a
lighted
match
in
his
hand
he
gave
a
shout
of
triumph
finally
and
reappeared
from
behind
the
bed
with
the
broken
end
of
my
knife
in
his
hand
very
clumsy
he
said
clumsy
peter
the
dog
could
have
done
better
i
had
been
examining
the
about
the
among
the
were
one
or
two
reddish
ones
that
made
me
shiver
and
seeing
a
scrap
of
stuck
between
the
and
the
wall
i
dug
it
out
with
a
hairpin
and
threw
it
into
the
grate
to
be
burned
later
it
was
by
the
merest
chance
there
was
no
fire
there
the
next
moment
holcombe
was
on
his
knees
by
the
fireplace
reaching
for
the
scrap
do
that
under
such
circumstances
he
snapped
fishing
among
the
ashes
you
might
throw
away
valuable
hello
howell
i
turned
and
saw
a
young
man
in
the
doorway
smiling
his
hat
in
his
hand
even
at
that
first
glance
i
liked
howell
and
later
when
every
one
was
against
him
and
many
curious
things
were
developing
i
stood
by
him
through
everything
and
even
helped
him
to
the
thing
he
wanted
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
but
that
of
course
was
later
what
the
trouble
holcombe
he
asked
hitting
the
trail
again
a
very
curious
thing
that
i
just
happened
on
said
holcombe
pitman
this
is
howell
of
whom
i
spoke
sit
down
howell
and
let
me
read
you
something
with
the
crumpled
paper
still
unopened
in
his
hand
holcombe
took
his
and
read
aloud
what
he
had
written
i
have
it
before
me
now
meat
two
dollars
boat
hire
that
not
it
here
sunday
march
the
pitman
landlady
at
union
street
heard
two
of
her
boarders
quarreling
a
man
and
his
wife
man
name
philip
ladley
wife
name
jennie
ladley
known
as
jennie
brice
at
the
liberty
stock
company
where
she
has
been
playing
small
parts
howell
nodded
i
heard
of
her
he
said
not
much
of
an
actress
i
believe
husband
was
also
an
actor
out
of
work
and
employing
his
leisure
time
in
writing
a
play
everybody
doing
it
said
howell
idly
the
shuberts
were
to
star
him
in
this
i
put
in
he
said
that
the
climax
at
the
end
of
the
second
act
holcombe
shut
his
with
a
snap
after
we
have
finished
gossiping
he
said
i
go
on
his
leisure
time
in
writing
a
play
quoted
howell
exactly
husband
and
wife
were
not
on
good
terms
they
quarreled
frequently
on
sunday
they
fought
all
day
and
ladley
told
pitman
she
was
married
to
a
fiend
at
four
sunday
afternoon
philip
ladley
went
out
returning
about
five
pitman
carried
their
supper
to
them
at
six
and
both
ate
heartily
she
did
not
see
ladley
at
the
time
but
heard
her
in
the
next
room
they
were
apparently
reconciled
pitman
reports
ladley
in
high
good
humor
if
the
quarrel
recommenced
during
the
night
the
other
boarder
named
reynolds
in
the
next
room
heard
nothing
pitman
was
up
and
down
until
one
when
she
dozed
off
she
heard
no
unusual
sound
approximately
two
in
the
morning
however
this
reynolds
came
to
the
room
and
said
he
had
heard
some
one
in
a
boat
in
the
lower
hall
he
and
pitman
investigated
the
boat
which
pitman
uses
during
a
flood
and
which
she
had
tied
to
the
was
gone
having
been
cut
loose
not
untied
everything
else
was
quiet
except
that
ladley
dog
had
been
shut
in
a
room
a
quarter
after
four
that
morning
pitman
thoroughly
awake
heard
the
boat
returning
and
going
to
the
stairs
met
ladley
coming
in
he
muttered
something
about
having
gone
for
medicine
for
his
wife
and
went
to
his
room
shutting
the
dog
out
this
is
worth
attention
for
the
dog
ordinarily
slept
in
their
room
what
sort
of
a
dog
asked
howell
he
had
been
listening
attentively
a
rest
of
the
night
or
early
morning
was
quiet
at
a
quarter
after
seven
ladley
asked
for
coffee
and
toast
for
one
and
on
pitman
remarking
this
said
that
his
wife
was
not
playing
this
week
and
had
gone
for
a
few
days
vacation
having
left
early
in
the
morning
remember
during
the
night
he
had
been
out
for
medicine
for
her
now
she
was
able
to
travel
and
in
fact
had
started
howell
was
frowning
at
the
floor
if
he
was
doing
anything
wrong
he
was
doing
it
very
badly
he
said
this
is
where
i
entered
the
case
said
holcombe
i
rowed
into
the
lower
hall
this
morning
to
feed
the
dog
peter
who
was
whining
on
the
staircase
pitman
was
coming
down
pale
and
agitated
over
the
fact
that
the
dog
shortly
before
had
found
floating
in
the
parlor
a
slipper
belonging
to
ladley
and
later
a
knife
with
a
broken
blade
she
maintains
that
she
had
the
knife
last
night
that
it
was
not
broken
and
that
it
was
taken
from
a
shelf
in
her
room
while
she
dozed
the
question
is
then
why
was
the
knife
taken
who
took
it
and
why
has
this
man
made
away
with
his
wife
or
has
he
not
howell
looked
at
me
and
smiled
holcombe
and
i
are
old
enemies
he
said
holcombe
believes
that
circumstantial
evidence
may
probably
hang
a
man
i
do
not
and
to
holcombe
so
having
found
a
wet
slipper
and
a
broken
knife
you
are
prepared
for
murder
and
sudden
death
i
have
more
evidence
holcombe
said
eagerly
and
proceeded
to
tell
what
we
had
found
in
the
room
howell
listened
smiling
to
himself
but
at
the
mention
of
the
onyx
clock
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
mantel
by
jove
he
said
and
stood
looking
at
the
mark
in
the
dust
are
you
sure
the
clock
was
here
yesterday
i
wound
it
night
before
last
and
put
the
key
underneath
yesterday
before
they
moved
up
i
wound
it
again
the
key
is
gone
also
well
what
of
it
holcombe
did
he
brain
her
with
the
clock
or
choke
her
with
the
key
holcombe
was
looking
at
his
to
summarize
he
said
we
have
here
as
clues
indicating
a
crime
the
rope
the
broken
knife
the
slipper
the
towel
and
the
clock
besides
this
scrap
of
paper
may
contain
some
information
he
opened
it
and
sat
gazing
at
it
in
his
palm
then
is
this
ladley
writing
he
asked
me
in
a
curious
voice
yes
i
glanced
at
the
slip
holcombe
had
just
read
from
his
rope
knife
slipper
towel
clock
the
slip
i
had
found
behind
the
said
rope
knife
shoe
towel
horn
the
rest
of
the
last
word
was
torn
off
howell
was
staring
at
the
mantel
clock
he
repeated
chapter
iv
it
was
after
four
when
holcombe
had
finished
going
over
the
room
i
offered
to
make
both
the
gentlemen
some
tea
for
pitman
had
been
an
englishman
and
i
had
got
into
the
habit
of
having
a
cup
in
the
afternoon
with
a
cracker
or
a
bit
of
bread
but
they
refused
howell
said
he
had
promised
to
meet
a
lady
and
to
bring
her
through
the
flooded
district
in
a
boat
he
shook
hands
with
me
and
smiled
at
holcombe
you
will
have
to
restrain
his
enthusiasm
pitman
he
said
he
is
a
bloodhound
on
the
scent
if
his
baying
gets
on
your
nerves
just
send
for
me
he
went
down
the
stairs
and
stepped
into
the
boat
remember
holcombe
he
called
every
murder
has
two
things
a
motive
and
a
corpse
you
have
either
only
a
mass
of
piffling
details
if
everybody
waited
until
he
saw
flames
instead
of
relying
on
the
testimony
of
the
smoke
holcombe
snapped
what
would
the
fire
loss
be
howell
poled
his
boat
to
the
front
door
and
sitting
down
prepared
to
row
out
you
are
warned
pitman
he
called
to
me
if
he
does
find
a
body
to
fit
the
clues
he
quite
capable
of
making
one
to
fill
the
demand
horn
said
holcombe
looking
at
the
slip
again
the
tail
of
the
is
torn
off
evidently
only
part
of
a
word
hornet
horning
horner
pitman
will
you
go
with
me
to
the
police
station
i
was
more
than
anxious
to
go
in
fact
i
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
staying
alone
in
the
house
with
heaven
only
knows
what
concealed
in
the
depths
of
that
muddy
flood
i
got
on
my
wraps
again
and
holcombe
rowed
me
out
peter
plunged
into
the
water
to
follow
and
had
to
be
sent
back
he
sat
on
the
lower
step
and
whined
holcombe
threw
him
another
piece
of
liver
but
he
did
not
touch
it
we
rowed
to
the
corner
of
robinson
street
and
federal
it
was
before
federal
street
was
raised
above
the
flood
level
and
left
the
boat
in
charge
of
a
boy
there
and
we
walked
to
the
police
station
on
the
way
holcombe
questioned
me
closely
about
the
events
of
the
morning
and
i
recalled
the
incident
of
the
burned
he
made
a
note
of
it
at
once
and
grew
very
thoughtful
he
left
me
however
at
the
police
station
i
rather
not
appear
in
this
pitman
he
said
apologetically
and
i
think
better
along
my
own
lines
not
that
i
have
anything
against
the
police
done
some
splendid
work
but
this
case
takes
imagination
and
the
police
department
deals
with
facts
we
have
no
facts
yet
what
we
need
of
course
is
to
have
the
man
detained
until
we
are
sure
of
our
case
he
lifted
his
hat
and
turned
away
and
i
went
slowly
up
the
steps
to
the
police
station
living
as
i
had
in
a
neighborhood
where
the
police
like
the
poor
are
always
with
us
and
where
the
visits
of
the
patrol
wagon
are
one
of
those
familiar
sights
that
no
amount
of
repetition
enabled
any
of
us
to
treat
with
contempt
i
was
uncomfortable
until
i
remembered
that
my
grandfather
had
been
one
of
the
first
mayors
of
the
city
and
that
if
the
patrol
had
been
at
my
house
more
than
once
the
entire
neighborhood
would
testify
that
my
boarders
were
usually
orderly
at
the
door
some
one
touched
me
on
the
arm
it
was
holcombe
again
i
have
been
thinking
it
over
he
said
and
i
believe
you
better
not
mention
the
piece
of
paper
that
you
found
behind
the
they
might
say
the
whole
thing
is
a
hoax
very
well
i
agreed
and
went
in
the
police
sergeant
in
charge
knew
me
at
once
having
stopped
at
my
house
more
than
once
in
for
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
sit
down
pitman
he
said
i
suppose
you
are
still
making
the
best
coffee
and
doughnuts
in
the
city
of
allegheny
well
what
the
trouble
in
your
district
want
an
injunction
against
the
river
for
trespass
the
river
has
brought
me
a
good
bit
of
trouble
i
said
i
worried
mr
sergeant
i
think
a
woman
from
my
house
has
been
murdered
but
i
do
know
murdered
he
said
and
drew
up
his
chair
tell
me
about
it
i
told
him
everything
while
he
sat
back
with
his
eyes
half
closed
and
his
fingers
beating
a
tattoo
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
when
i
finished
he
got
up
and
went
into
an
inner
room
he
came
back
in
a
moment
i
want
you
to
come
in
and
tell
that
to
the
chief
he
said
and
led
the
way
all
told
i
repeated
my
story
three
times
that
afternoon
to
the
sergeant
to
the
chief
of
police
and
the
third
time
to
both
the
others
and
two
detectives
the
second
time
the
chief
made
notes
of
what
i
said
know
this
man
ladley
he
asked
the
others
none
of
them
did
but
they
all
knew
of
jennie
brice
and
some
of
them
had
seen
her
in
the
theater
get
the
theater
tom
the
chief
said
to
one
of
the
detectives
luckily
what
he
learned
over
the
telephone
from
the
theater
corroborated
my
story
jennie
brice
was
not
in
the
cast
that
week
but
should
have
reported
that
morning
monday
to
rehearse
the
next
piece
no
message
had
been
received
from
her
and
a
substitute
had
been
put
in
her
place
the
chief
hung
up
the
receiver
and
turned
to
me
you
are
sure
about
the
clock
mrs
pitman
he
asked
it
was
there
when
they
moved
to
the
room
yes
sir
you
are
certain
you
will
not
find
it
on
the
parlor
mantel
when
the
water
goes
down
the
mantels
are
uncovered
now
it
is
not
there
you
think
ladley
has
gone
for
good
yes
sir
he
be
a
fool
to
try
to
run
away
unless
graves
you
better
get
hold
of
the
fellow
and
keep
him
until
either
the
woman
is
found
or
a
body
the
river
is
falling
in
a
couple
of
days
we
will
know
if
she
is
around
the
premises
anywhere
before
i
left
i
described
jennie
brice
for
them
carefully
asked
what
she
probably
wore
if
she
had
gone
away
as
her
husband
said
i
had
no
idea
she
had
a
lot
of
clothes
and
dressed
a
good
bit
but
i
recalled
that
i
had
seen
lying
on
the
bed
the
black
and
white
dress
with
the
red
collar
and
they
took
that
down
as
well
as
the
brown
valise
the
chief
rose
and
opened
the
door
for
me
himself
if
she
actually
left
town
at
the
time
you
mention
he
said
she
ought
not
to
be
hard
to
find
there
are
not
many
trains
before
seven
in
the
morning
and
most
of
them
are
locals
and
and
if
she
did
not
if
he
do
you
think
she
is
in
the
house
or
or
the
cellar
not
unless
ladley
is
more
of
a
fool
than
i
think
he
is
he
said
smiling
personally
i
believe
she
has
gone
away
as
he
says
she
did
but
if
she
has
he
probably
took
the
body
with
him
when
he
said
he
was
getting
medicine
and
dropped
it
in
the
current
somewhere
but
we
must
go
slow
with
all
this
there
no
use
shouting
yet
but
the
towel
he
may
have
cut
himself
shaving
it
been
done
and
the
knife
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
seen
a
perfectly
good
knife
spoiled
opening
a
bottle
of
pickles
but
the
slippers
and
the
clock
my
good
woman
enough
shoes
and
slippers
are
forgotten
in
the
bottoms
of
cupboards
year
after
year
in
and
are
found
floating
around
the
streets
to
make
all
the
in
town
happy
i
have
seen
almost
everything
floating
about
during
one
of
these
annual
floods
i
dare
say
you
never
saw
an
onyx
clock
floating
around
i
replied
a
little
sharply
i
had
no
sense
of
humor
that
day
he
stopped
smiling
at
once
and
stood
tugging
at
his
mustache
no
he
admitted
an
onyx
clock
sinks
that
true
that
a
very
nice
little
point
that
onyx
clock
he
may
be
trying
to
sell
it
or
perhaps
he
did
not
finish
i
went
back
immediately
only
stopping
at
the
market
to
get
meat
for
reynolds
supper
it
was
after
half
past
five
and
dusk
was
coming
on
i
got
a
boat
and
was
rowed
directly
home
peter
was
not
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
i
paid
the
boatman
and
let
him
go
and
turned
to
go
up
the
stairs
some
one
was
speaking
in
the
hall
above
i
have
read
somewhere
that
no
two
voices
are
exactly
alike
just
as
no
two
violins
ever
produce
precisely
the
same
sound
i
think
it
is
what
they
call
the
timbre
that
is
different
i
have
for
instance
never
heard
a
voice
like
pitman
although
harry
lauder
in
a
phonograph
resembles
it
and
voices
have
always
done
for
me
what
odors
do
for
some
people
revived
forgotten
scenes
and
old
memories
but
the
memory
that
the
voice
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
brought
back
was
not
very
old
although
i
had
forgotten
it
i
seemed
to
hear
again
all
at
once
the
lapping
of
the
water
sunday
morning
as
it
began
to
come
in
over
the
the
sound
of
terry
ripping
up
the
parlor
carpet
and
ladley
calling
me
a
in
the
next
room
in
reply
to
this
very
voice
but
when
i
got
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
it
was
only
howell
who
had
brought
his
visitor
to
the
flood
district
and
on
getting
her
splashed
with
the
muddy
water
had
taken
her
to
my
house
for
a
towel
and
a
cake
of
soap
i
lighted
the
lamp
in
the
hall
and
howell
introduced
the
girl
she
was
a
pretty
girl
slim
and
young
and
she
had
taken
her
wetting
i
know
we
are
intruders
pitman
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
especially
now
when
you
are
in
trouble
i
have
told
miss
harvey
a
little
howell
said
and
i
promised
to
show
her
peter
but
he
is
not
here
i
think
i
had
known
it
was
my
sister
child
from
the
moment
i
lighted
the
lamp
there
was
something
of
alma
in
her
not
alma
hardness
or
haughtiness
but
alma
dark
blue
eyes
with
black
lashes
and
nose
alma
was
always
the
beauty
of
the
family
what
with
the
excitement
and
seeing
alma
child
like
this
in
my
house
i
felt
things
going
round
and
clutched
at
the
howell
caught
me
why
mrs
pitman
he
said
what
the
matter
i
got
myself
in
hand
in
a
moment
and
smiled
at
the
girl
nothing
at
all
i
said
indigestion
most
likely
too
much
tea
the
last
day
or
two
and
not
enough
solid
food
i
been
too
anxious
to
eat
lida
for
she
was
that
to
me
at
once
although
i
had
never
seen
her
before
lida
was
all
sympathy
and
sweetness
she
actually
asked
me
to
go
with
her
to
a
restaurant
and
have
a
real
dinner
i
could
imagine
alma
had
she
known
but
i
excused
myself
i
have
to
cook
something
for
reynolds
i
said
and
i
better
now
anyhow
thank
you
howell
may
i
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
he
followed
me
along
the
back
hall
which
was
dusk
i
have
remembered
something
that
i
had
forgotten
howell
i
said
on
sunday
morning
the
ladleys
had
a
visitor
yes
they
had
very
few
visitors
i
see
i
did
not
see
him
but
i
heard
his
voice
howell
did
not
move
but
i
fancied
he
drew
his
breath
in
quickly
it
sounded
it
was
not
by
any
chance
i
a
newspaper
man
who
goes
to
bed
at
three
on
sunday
morning
up
and
about
at
ten
i
did
say
what
time
it
was
i
said
sharply
but
at
that
moment
lida
called
from
the
front
hall
i
think
i
hear
peter
she
said
he
is
shut
in
somewhere
whining
we
went
forward
at
once
she
was
right
peter
was
scratching
at
the
door
of
ladley
room
although
i
had
left
the
door
closed
and
peter
in
the
hall
i
let
him
out
and
he
crawled
to
me
on
three
legs
whimpering
howell
bent
over
him
and
felt
the
fourth
poor
little
beast
he
said
his
leg
is
broken
he
made
a
splint
for
the
dog
and
with
lida
helping
they
put
him
to
bed
in
a
in
my
kitchen
it
was
easy
to
see
how
things
lay
with
howell
he
was
all
eyes
for
her
he
made
excuses
to
touch
her
hand
or
her
arm
little
caressing
touches
that
made
her
color
heighten
and
with
it
all
there
was
a
sort
of
hopelessness
in
his
manner
as
if
he
knew
how
far
the
girl
was
out
of
his
reach
knowing
alma
and
her
pride
i
knew
better
than
they
how
hopeless
it
was
i
was
not
so
sure
about
lida
i
wondered
if
she
was
in
love
with
the
boy
or
only
in
love
with
love
she
was
very
young
as
i
had
been
god
help
her
if
like
me
she
sacrificed
everything
to
discover
too
late
that
she
was
only
in
love
with
love
chapter
v
reynolds
did
not
come
home
to
dinner
after
all
the
water
had
got
into
the
basement
at
the
store
he
telephoned
one
of
the
in
a
sewer
having
leaked
and
they
were
moving
some
of
the
departments
to
an
upper
floor
i
had
expected
to
have
him
in
the
house
that
evening
and
now
i
was
left
alone
again
but
as
it
happened
i
was
not
alone
graves
one
of
the
city
detectives
came
at
half
past
six
and
went
carefully
over
the
ladleys
room
i
showed
him
the
towel
and
the
slipper
and
the
broken
knife
and
where
we
had
found
the
he
was
very
and
left
in
a
taking
the
articles
with
him
in
a
newspaper
at
seven
the
rang
i
went
down
as
far
as
i
could
on
the
staircase
and
i
saw
a
boat
outside
the
door
with
the
boatman
and
a
woman
in
it
i
called
to
them
to
bring
the
boat
back
along
the
hall
and
i
had
a
queer
feeling
that
it
might
be
ladley
and
that
been
making
a
fool
of
myself
all
day
for
nothing
but
it
was
not
ladley
is
this
number
asked
the
woman
as
the
boat
came
back
yes
does
ladley
live
here
yes
but
he
is
not
here
now
are
you
mrs
pittock
pitman
yes
the
boat
bumped
against
the
stairs
and
the
woman
got
out
she
was
as
tall
as
ladley
and
when
i
saw
her
in
the
light
from
the
upper
hall
i
knew
her
instantly
it
was
temple
hope
the
leading
woman
from
the
liberty
theater
i
would
like
to
talk
to
you
pitman
she
said
where
can
we
go
i
led
the
way
back
to
my
room
and
when
she
had
followed
me
in
she
turned
and
shut
the
door
now
then
she
said
without
any
preliminary
where
is
jennie
brice
i
do
know
miss
hope
i
answered
we
looked
at
each
other
for
a
minute
and
each
of
us
saw
what
the
other
suspected
he
has
killed
her
she
exclaimed
she
was
afraid
he
would
do
it
and
he
has
killed
her
and
thrown
her
into
the
river
i
said
that
what
i
think
and
he
go
free
at
that
it
seems
there
is
any
murder
when
there
is
any
corpse
nonsense
if
he
has
done
that
the
river
will
give
her
up
eventually
the
river
does
always
give
them
up
i
retorted
not
in
anyhow
or
when
they
are
found
it
is
months
later
and
you
ca
prove
anything
she
had
only
a
little
time
being
due
at
the
theater
soon
but
she
sat
down
and
told
me
the
story
she
told
afterward
on
the
stand
she
had
known
jennie
brice
for
years
they
having
been
together
in
the
chorus
as
long
before
as
she
was
married
then
to
a
fellow
on
the
vaudeville
circuit
miss
hope
said
he
left
her
about
that
time
and
she
took
up
with
ladley
i
do
think
they
were
ever
married
what
i
said
jumping
to
my
feet
and
they
came
to
a
respectable
house
like
this
there
never
been
a
breath
of
scandal
about
this
house
miss
hope
and
if
this
comes
out
i
ruined
well
perhaps
they
were
married
she
said
anyhow
they
were
always
quarreling
and
when
he
was
playing
it
was
worse
she
used
to
come
to
my
hotel
and
cry
her
eyes
out
i
knew
you
were
friends
i
said
almost
the
last
thing
she
said
to
me
was
about
the
black
and
white
dress
of
hers
you
were
to
borrow
for
the
piece
this
week
black
and
white
dress
i
borrow
one
of
jennie
brice
dresses
exclaimed
miss
hope
i
should
think
not
i
have
plenty
of
my
own
that
puzzled
me
for
she
had
said
it
that
was
sure
and
then
i
remembered
that
i
had
not
seen
the
dress
in
the
room
that
day
and
i
went
in
to
look
for
it
it
was
gone
i
came
back
and
told
miss
hope
a
black
and
white
dress
did
it
have
a
red
collar
she
asked
yes
then
i
remember
it
she
wore
a
small
black
hat
with
a
red
quill
with
that
dress
you
might
look
for
the
hat
she
followed
me
back
to
the
room
and
stood
in
the
doorway
while
i
searched
the
hat
was
gone
too
perhaps
after
all
he
telling
the
truth
she
said
thoughtfully
her
fur
coat
is
in
the
closet
is
it
was
gone
it
is
strange
that
all
day
i
had
never
thought
of
looking
over
her
clothes
and
seeing
what
was
missing
i
had
known
all
she
had
of
course
but
i
had
seen
her
all
winter
in
her
fur
coat
and
admired
it
it
was
a
striped
fur
brown
and
gray
and
very
unusual
but
with
the
coat
missing
and
a
dress
and
hat
gone
it
began
to
look
as
if
i
had
been
making
a
fool
of
myself
and
stirring
up
a
tempest
in
a
teacup
miss
hope
was
as
puzzled
as
i
was
anyhow
if
he
did
kill
her
she
said
it
is
because
he
did
not
want
to
only
last
week
she
had
hysterics
in
my
and
said
he
had
threatened
to
poison
her
it
was
all
bronson
the
business
manager
and
i
could
do
to
quiet
her
she
looked
at
her
watch
and
exclaimed
that
she
was
late
and
would
have
to
hurry
i
saw
her
down
to
her
boat
the
river
had
been
falling
rapidly
for
the
last
hour
or
two
and
i
heard
the
boat
scrape
as
it
went
over
the
i
did
not
know
whether
to
be
glad
that
the
water
was
going
down
and
i
could
live
like
a
christian
again
or
to
be
sorry
for
fear
of
what
we
might
find
in
the
mud
that
was
always
left
peter
was
lying
where
i
had
put
him
on
a
folded
blanket
laid
in
a
i
went
back
to
him
and
sat
down
beside
the
basket
peter
i
said
poor
old
peter
who
did
this
to
you
who
hurt
you
he
looked
at
me
and
whined
as
if
he
wanted
to
tell
me
if
only
he
could
was
it
mr
ladley
i
asked
and
the
poor
thing
cowered
close
to
his
bed
and
shivered
i
wondered
if
it
had
been
he
and
if
it
had
why
he
had
come
back
perhaps
he
had
remembered
the
towel
perhaps
he
would
come
again
and
spend
the
night
there
i
was
like
peter
i
cowered
and
shivered
at
the
very
thought
at
nine
i
heard
a
boat
at
the
door
it
had
stuck
there
and
its
occupant
was
scolding
furiously
at
the
boatman
soon
after
i
heard
splashing
and
i
knew
that
whoever
it
was
was
wading
back
to
the
stairs
through
the
foot
and
a
half
or
so
of
water
still
in
the
hall
i
ran
back
to
my
room
and
locked
myself
in
and
then
stood
armed
with
the
in
case
it
should
be
ladley
and
he
should
break
the
door
in
the
steps
came
up
the
stairs
and
peter
barked
furiously
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
was
to
be
my
end
killed
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
and
thrown
out
the
window
to
float
like
my
kitchen
chair
into
mollie
kitchen
or
to
be
found
lying
in
the
ooze
of
the
yard
after
the
river
had
gone
down
the
steps
hesitated
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
turned
back
along
the
hall
peter
redoubled
his
noise
he
never
barked
for
reynolds
or
the
ladleys
i
stood
still
hardly
able
to
breathe
the
door
was
thin
and
the
lock
loose
one
good
blow
and
the
turned
and
i
screamed
i
recall
that
the
light
turned
black
and
that
is
all
i
remember
until
i
came
to
a
later
and
saw
holcombe
stooping
over
me
the
door
with
the
lock
broken
was
standing
open
i
tried
to
move
and
then
i
saw
that
my
feet
were
propped
up
on
the
edge
of
peter
basket
better
leave
them
up
holcombe
said
it
sends
the
blood
back
to
the
head
half
the
damfool
people
in
the
world
stick
a
pillow
under
a
fainting
woman
shoulders
how
are
you
now
all
right
i
said
feebly
i
thought
you
were
mr
ladley
he
helped
me
up
and
i
sat
in
a
chair
and
tried
to
keep
my
lips
from
shaking
and
then
i
saw
that
holcombe
had
brought
a
suit
case
with
him
and
had
set
it
inside
the
door
ladley
is
safe
until
he
gets
bail
anyhow
he
said
they
picked
him
up
as
he
was
boarding
a
pennsylvania
train
bound
east
for
murder
i
asked
as
a
suspicious
character
he
replied
grimly
that
does
as
well
as
anything
for
a
time
he
sat
down
opposite
me
and
looked
at
me
intently
pitman
he
said
did
you
ever
hear
the
story
of
the
horse
that
wandered
out
of
a
village
and
could
not
be
found
i
shook
my
head
well
the
best
wit
of
the
village
failed
to
locate
the
horse
but
one
day
the
village
idiot
walked
into
town
leading
the
missing
animal
by
the
bridle
when
they
asked
him
how
he
had
done
it
he
said
i
just
thought
what
i
do
if
i
was
a
horse
and
then
i
went
and
did
it
i
see
i
said
humoring
him
you
see
now
what
are
we
trying
to
do
we
trying
to
find
a
body
do
you
intend
to
become
a
corpse
he
leaned
over
and
tapped
on
the
table
between
us
we
are
trying
to
prove
a
crime
i
intend
for
the
time
to
be
the
criminal
he
looked
so
curious
bent
forward
and
glaring
at
me
from
under
his
bushy
eyebrows
with
his
shoes
on
his
knee
for
he
had
taken
them
off
to
wade
to
the
stairs
and
his
trousers
rolled
to
his
knees
that
i
wondered
if
he
was
entirely
sane
but
holcombe
eccentric
as
he
might
be
was
sane
enough
not
a
criminal
as
really
as
lies
in
me
listen
pitman
i
want
to
put
myself
in
ladley
place
for
a
day
or
two
live
as
he
lived
do
what
he
did
even
think
as
he
thought
if
i
can
i
am
going
to
sleep
in
his
room
with
your
permission
i
could
not
see
any
reason
for
objecting
although
i
thought
it
silly
and
useless
i
led
the
way
to
the
front
room
holcombe
following
with
his
shoes
and
suit
case
i
lighted
a
lamp
and
he
stood
looking
around
him
i
see
you
have
been
here
since
we
left
this
afternoon
he
said
twice
i
replied
first
with
graves
and
later
the
words
died
on
my
tongue
some
one
had
been
in
the
room
since
my
last
visit
there
he
has
been
here
i
gasped
i
left
the
room
in
tolerable
order
look
at
it
when
were
you
here
last
at
or
thereabouts
where
were
you
between
and
in
the
kitchen
with
peter
i
told
him
then
about
the
dog
and
about
finding
him
shut
in
the
room
the
was
pulled
out
the
sheets
of
ladley
manuscript
usually
an
orderly
pile
were
half
on
the
floor
the
bed
coverings
had
been
jerked
off
and
flung
over
the
back
of
a
chair
peter
imprisoned
have
moved
the
and
upset
the
manuscript
peter
had
never
put
the
over
the
chair
or
broken
his
own
leg
humph
he
said
and
getting
out
his
he
made
an
exact
memorandum
of
what
i
had
told
him
and
of
the
condition
of
the
room
that
done
he
turned
to
me
pitman
he
said
i
thank
you
to
call
me
ladley
for
the
next
day
or
so
i
am
an
actor
out
of
employment
years
of
age
short
stout
and
bald
married
to
a
woman
i
would
like
to
be
quit
of
and
i
am
writing
myself
a
play
in
which
the
shuberts
intend
to
star
me
or
in
which
i
intend
the
shuberts
to
star
me
very
well
ladley
i
said
trying
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
and
god
knows
seeing
no
humor
in
it
then
you
like
your
soda
from
the
soda
for
what
for
your
whisky
and
soda
before
you
go
to
bed
sir
oh
certainly
yes
bring
the
soda
and
just
a
moment
pitman
holcombe
is
a
total
abstainer
and
has
always
been
so
it
is
ladley
not
holcombe
who
takes
this
abominable
stuff
i
said
i
quite
understood
but
that
ladley
could
skip
a
night
if
he
so
wished
but
the
little
gentleman
would
not
hear
to
it
and
when
i
brought
the
soda
poured
himself
a
double
portion
he
stood
looking
at
it
with
his
face
screwed
up
as
if
the
very
odor
revolted
him
the
chances
are
he
said
that
ladley
that
i
having
a
nasty
piece
of
work
to
do
during
the
night
would
will
take
a
larger
drink
than
usual
he
raised
the
glass
only
to
put
it
down
do
forget
he
said
to
put
a
large
knife
where
you
left
the
one
last
night
sorry
the
water
has
gone
down
but
i
shall
imagine
it
still
at
the
seventh
step
good
night
mrs
pitman
good
night
ladley
i
said
smiling
and
remember
you
are
three
weeks
in
arrears
with
your
board
his
eyes
twinkled
through
his
spectacles
i
shall
imagine
it
paid
he
said
i
went
out
and
i
heard
him
close
the
door
behind
me
then
through
the
door
i
heard
a
great
sputtering
and
coughing
and
i
knew
he
had
got
the
whisky
down
somehow
i
put
the
knife
out
as
he
had
asked
me
to
and
went
to
bed
i
was
ready
to
drop
not
even
the
knowledge
that
an
imaginary
ladley
was
about
to
commit
an
imaginary
crime
in
the
house
that
night
could
keep
me
awake
reynolds
came
in
at
eleven
i
was
roused
when
he
banged
his
door
that
was
all
i
knew
until
morning
the
sun
on
my
face
wakened
me
peter
in
his
basket
lifted
his
head
as
i
moved
and
thumped
his
tail
against
his
pillow
in
greeting
i
put
on
a
wrapper
and
called
reynolds
by
knocking
at
his
door
then
i
went
on
to
the
front
room
the
door
was
closed
and
some
one
beyond
was
groaning
my
heart
stood
still
and
then
raced
on
i
opened
the
door
and
looked
in
holcombe
was
on
the
bed
fully
dressed
he
had
a
wet
towel
tied
around
his
head
and
his
face
looked
swollen
and
puffy
he
opened
one
eye
and
looked
at
me
what
a
night
he
groaned
what
happened
what
did
you
find
he
groaned
again
find
he
said
nothing
except
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
that
whisky
it
poisoned
me
i
have
been
out
of
the
house
so
for
that
day
at
least
ladley
became
holcombe
again
and
as
such
accepted
ice
in
quantities
a
mustard
plaster
over
his
stomach
and
considerable
nursing
by
evening
he
was
better
but
although
he
clearly
intended
to
stay
on
he
said
nothing
about
changing
his
identity
again
and
i
was
glad
enough
the
very
name
of
ladley
was
horrible
to
me
the
river
went
down
almost
entirely
that
day
although
there
was
still
considerable
water
in
the
cellars
it
takes
time
to
get
rid
of
that
the
lower
floors
showed
nothing
suspicious
the
papers
were
ruined
of
course
the
doors
warped
and
sprung
and
the
floors
coated
with
mud
and
debris
terry
came
in
the
afternoon
and
together
we
hung
the
rug
out
to
dry
in
the
sun
as
i
was
coming
in
i
looked
over
at
the
maguire
yard
molly
maguire
was
there
and
all
her
children
around
her
gaping
molly
was
hanging
out
to
dry
a
sodden
fur
coat
that
had
once
been
striped
brown
and
gray
i
went
over
after
breakfast
and
claimed
the
coat
as
belonging
to
ladley
but
she
refused
to
give
it
up
there
is
a
sort
of
unwritten
law
concerning
the
salvage
of
flood
articles
and
i
had
to
leave
the
coat
as
i
had
my
kitchen
chair
but
it
was
ladley
beyond
a
doubt
i
shuddered
when
i
thought
how
it
had
probably
got
into
the
water
and
yet
it
was
curious
too
for
if
she
had
had
it
on
how
did
it
get
loose
to
go
floating
around
molly
maguire
yard
and
if
she
had
not
worn
it
how
did
it
get
in
the
water
chapter
vi
the
newspapers
were
full
of
the
ladley
case
with
its
curious
solution
and
many
surprises
it
was
considered
unique
in
many
ways
pitman
had
always
read
all
the
murder
trials
and
used
to
talk
about
the
and
writs
of
being
the
legal
way
i
believe
of
spelling
corpse
but
i
came
out
of
the
ladley
trial
for
it
came
to
trial
ultimately
with
only
one
point
of
law
that
i
was
sure
of
that
was
that
it
is
mighty
hard
to
prove
a
man
a
murderer
unless
you
can
show
what
he
killed
and
that
was
the
weakness
in
the
ladley
case
there
was
a
body
but
it
could
not
be
identified
the
police
held
ladley
for
a
day
or
two
and
then
nothing
appearing
they
let
him
go
holcombe
who
was
still
occupying
the
second
floor
front
almost
wept
with
rage
and
despair
when
he
read
the
news
in
the
papers
he
was
still
working
on
the
case
in
his
curious
way
wandering
along
the
wharves
at
night
and
writing
letters
all
over
the
country
to
learn
about
philip
ladley
previous
life
and
his
wife
but
he
did
not
seem
to
get
anywhere
the
newspapers
had
been
full
of
the
jennie
brice
disappearance
for
disappearance
it
proved
to
be
so
far
as
could
be
learned
she
had
not
left
the
city
that
night
or
since
and
as
she
was
a
woman
very
blond
as
i
have
said
with
a
full
voice
and
a
languid
manner
she
could
hardly
have
taken
refuge
anywhere
without
being
discovered
the
morning
after
her
disappearance
a
young
woman
tall
like
jennie
brice
and
fair
had
been
seen
in
the
union
station
but
as
she
was
accompanied
by
a
young
man
who
bought
her
magazines
and
papers
and
bade
her
an
excited
farewell
sending
his
love
to
various
members
of
a
family
and
promising
to
feed
the
canary
this
was
not
seriously
considered
a
sort
of
general
alarm
went
over
the
country
when
she
was
younger
she
had
been
pretty
well
known
at
the
broadway
theaters
in
new
york
one
way
or
another
the
liberty
theater
got
a
lot
of
free
advertising
from
the
case
and
i
believe
miss
salary
was
raised
the
police
communicated
with
jennie
brice
people
she
had
a
sister
in
olean
new
york
but
she
had
not
heard
from
her
the
sister
wrote
i
heard
later
that
jennie
had
been
unhappy
with
philip
ladley
and
afraid
he
would
kill
her
and
miss
hope
told
the
same
story
but
there
was
no
as
the
lawyers
say
and
finally
the
police
had
to
free
ladley
beyond
making
an
attempt
to
get
bail
and
failing
he
had
done
nothing
asked
about
his
wife
he
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
she
had
left
him
and
would
turn
up
all
right
he
was
unconcerned
smoked
cigarettes
all
day
ate
and
slept
well
and
looked
better
since
he
had
had
nothing
to
drink
and
two
or
three
days
after
the
arrest
he
sent
for
the
manuscript
of
his
play
howell
came
for
it
on
the
thursday
of
that
week
i
was
on
my
knees
scrubbing
the
parlor
floor
when
he
rang
the
bell
i
let
him
in
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
looked
tired
and
pale
well
pitman
he
said
smiling
what
did
you
find
in
the
cellar
when
the
water
went
down
i
glad
to
say
that
i
did
find
what
i
feared
mr
howell
not
even
the
onyx
clock
not
even
the
clock
i
replied
and
i
feel
as
if
i
lost
a
friend
a
clock
is
a
lot
of
company
do
you
know
what
i
think
he
said
looking
at
me
closely
i
think
you
put
that
clock
away
yourself
in
the
excitement
and
have
forgotten
all
about
it
nonsense
think
hard
he
was
very
much
in
earnest
you
knew
the
water
was
rising
and
the
ladleys
would
have
to
be
moved
up
to
the
second
floor
front
where
the
clock
stood
you
went
in
there
and
looked
around
to
see
if
the
room
was
ready
and
you
saw
the
clock
and
knowing
that
the
ladleys
quarreled
now
and
then
and
were
apt
to
throw
things
nothing
but
a
and
that
only
once
you
took
the
clock
to
the
attic
and
put
it
say
in
an
old
trunk
i
did
nothing
of
the
sort
i
went
in
as
you
say
and
i
put
up
an
old
splasher
because
of
the
way
he
throws
ink
about
then
i
wound
the
clock
put
the
key
under
it
and
went
out
and
the
key
is
gone
too
he
said
thoughtfully
i
wish
i
could
find
that
clock
mrs
pitman
so
do
i
ladley
went
out
sunday
afternoon
about
three
did
he
and
got
back
at
five
i
turned
and
looked
at
him
yes
howell
i
said
perhaps
know
something
about
that
i
he
changed
color
twenty
years
of
dunning
boarders
has
made
me
pretty
sharp
at
reading
faces
and
he
looked
as
uncomfortable
as
if
he
owed
me
money
i
i
knew
then
that
i
had
been
right
about
the
voice
it
had
been
his
you
i
retorted
you
were
here
sunday
morning
and
spent
some
time
with
the
ladleys
i
am
the
old
i
notice
you
did
tell
your
friend
holcombe
about
having
been
here
on
sunday
he
was
quick
to
recover
i
tell
you
all
about
it
pitman
he
said
smilingly
you
see
all
my
life
i
have
wished
for
an
onyx
clock
it
has
been
my
ambition
my
leaving
the
house
that
sunday
morning
and
hearing
the
ticking
of
the
clock
i
recognized
that
it
was
an
clock
clambered
from
my
boat
through
an
upper
window
and
so
reached
it
the
clock
showed
fight
but
after
stunning
it
with
a
chair
exactly
i
said
then
the
thing
ladley
said
she
would
not
do
was
probably
to
wind
the
clock
he
dropped
his
bantering
manner
at
once
pitman
he
said
i
do
know
what
you
heard
or
did
not
hear
but
i
want
you
to
give
me
a
little
time
before
you
tell
anybody
that
i
was
here
that
sunday
morning
and
in
return
i
find
your
clock
i
hesitated
but
however
put
out
he
was
he
did
look
like
a
criminal
besides
he
was
a
friend
of
my
niece
and
blood
is
thicker
even
than
there
was
nothing
wrong
about
my
being
here
he
went
on
but
i
do
want
it
known
do
spoil
a
good
story
mrs
pitman
i
did
not
quite
understand
that
although
those
who
followed
the
trial
carefully
may
do
so
poor
howell
i
am
sure
he
believed
that
it
was
only
a
good
story
he
got
the
description
of
my
onyx
clock
and
wrote
it
down
and
i
gave
him
the
manuscript
for
ladley
that
was
the
last
i
saw
of
him
for
some
time
that
thursday
proved
to
be
an
exciting
day
for
late
in
the
afternoon
terry
digging
the
mud
out
of
the
cellar
came
across
my
missing
gray
false
front
near
the
coal
vault
and
brought
it
up
grinning
and
just
before
six
graves
the
detective
rang
the
bell
and
then
let
himself
in
i
found
him
in
the
lower
hall
looking
around
well
pitman
he
said
has
our
friend
come
back
yet
she
was
no
friend
of
mine
not
ladley
he
be
out
this
evening
and
he
probably
be
around
for
his
clothes
i
felt
my
knees
waver
as
they
always
did
when
he
was
spoken
of
he
may
want
to
stay
here
said
graves
in
fact
i
think
just
what
he
want
not
here
i
protested
the
very
thought
of
him
makes
me
quake
if
he
comes
here
better
take
him
in
i
want
to
know
where
he
is
i
tried
to
say
that
i
would
have
him
but
the
old
habit
of
the
ward
asserted
itself
from
taking
a
bottle
of
beer
or
a
slice
of
pie
to
telling
one
where
one
might
or
might
not
live
the
police
were
autocrats
in
that
neighborhood
and
respectable
woman
that
i
am
my
neighbors
fears
of
the
front
office
have
infected
me
all
right
graves
i
said
he
pushed
the
parlor
door
open
and
looked
in
whistling
this
is
the
place
is
it
yes
but
it
was
that
he
i
see
tall
woman
mrs
ladley
tall
and
blond
very
airy
in
her
manner
he
nodded
and
still
stood
looking
in
and
whistling
never
heard
her
speak
of
a
town
named
horner
did
you
horner
no
i
see
he
turned
and
wandered
out
again
into
the
hall
still
whistling
at
the
door
however
he
stopped
and
turned
look
anything
like
this
he
asked
and
held
out
one
of
his
hands
with
a
small
kodak
picture
on
the
palm
it
was
a
of
a
children
frolic
in
a
village
street
with
some
onlookers
in
the
background
around
one
of
the
heads
had
been
drawn
a
circle
in
pencil
i
took
it
to
the
and
looked
at
it
closely
it
was
a
tall
woman
with
a
hat
on
not
unlike
jennie
brice
she
was
looking
over
the
crowd
and
i
could
see
only
her
face
and
that
in
shadow
i
shook
my
head
i
thought
not
he
said
we
have
a
lot
of
stage
pictures
of
her
but
what
with
false
hair
and
their
being
retouched
beyond
recognition
they
do
amount
to
much
he
started
out
and
stopped
on
the
to
light
a
cigar
take
him
on
if
he
comes
he
said
and
keep
your
eyes
open
feed
him
well
and
he
wo
kill
you
i
had
plenty
to
think
of
when
i
was
cooking
reynolds
supper
the
chance
that
i
might
have
ladley
again
and
the
woman
at
horner
for
it
had
come
to
me
like
a
flash
as
graves
left
that
the
horn
on
the
paper
slip
might
have
been
horner
chapter
vii
after
all
there
was
nothing
sensational
about
ladley
return
he
came
at
eight
that
night
and
with
his
hair
cut
and
although
he
had
a
he
rang
the
i
knew
his
ring
and
i
thought
it
no
harm
to
carry
an
old
razor
of
with
the
blade
open
and
folded
back
on
the
handle
the
way
the
colored
people
use
them
in
my
left
hand
but
i
saw
at
once
that
he
meant
no
mischief
good
evening
he
said
and
put
out
his
hand
i
jumped
back
until
i
saw
there
was
nothing
in
it
and
that
he
only
meant
to
shake
hands
i
did
do
it
i
might
have
to
take
him
in
and
make
his
bed
and
cook
his
meals
but
i
did
not
have
to
shake
hands
with
him
you
too
he
said
looking
at
me
with
what
i
suppose
he
meant
to
be
a
reproachful
look
but
he
could
no
more
put
an
expression
of
that
sort
in
his
eyes
than
a
fish
could
i
suppose
then
there
is
no
use
asking
if
i
may
have
my
old
room
the
front
room
i
wo
need
two
i
did
want
him
and
he
must
have
seen
it
but
i
took
him
you
may
have
it
as
far
as
i
concerned
i
said
but
you
have
to
let
the
in
assuredly
he
came
into
the
hall
and
stood
looking
around
him
and
i
fancied
he
drew
a
breath
of
relief
it
is
much
yet
he
said
but
it
better
to
look
at
than
six
feet
of
muddy
water
or
than
stone
walls
i
said
he
looked
at
me
and
smiled
or
than
stone
walls
he
repeated
bowing
and
went
into
his
room
so
i
had
him
again
and
if
i
gave
him
only
the
dull
knives
and
locked
up
the
the
moment
i
had
finished
with
it
who
can
blame
me
i
took
all
the
precaution
i
could
think
of
had
terry
put
an
extra
bolt
on
every
door
and
hid
the
rat
poison
and
the
carbolic
acid
in
the
cellar
peter
would
not
go
near
him
he
hobbled
around
on
his
three
legs
with
the
splint
beating
a
sort
of
tattoo
on
the
floor
but
he
stayed
back
in
the
kitchen
with
me
or
in
the
yard
it
was
sunday
night
or
early
monday
morning
that
jennie
brice
disappeared
on
thursday
evening
her
husband
came
back
on
friday
the
body
of
a
woman
was
washed
ashore
at
beaver
but
turned
out
to
be
that
of
a
stewardess
who
had
fallen
overboard
from
one
of
the
cincinnati
packets
ladley
himself
showed
me
the
article
in
the
morning
paper
when
i
took
in
his
breakfast
public
hysteria
has
killed
a
man
before
this
he
said
when
i
had
read
it
suppose
that
woman
had
been
mangled
or
the
screw
of
the
steamer
had
cut
her
head
off
how
many
people
do
you
suppose
would
have
been
willing
to
swear
that
it
was
my
was
mrs
ladley
even
without
a
head
i
should
know
ladley
i
retorted
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
let
trust
she
still
alive
for
my
sake
he
said
but
i
glad
anyhow
that
this
woman
had
a
head
you
allow
me
to
be
glad
wo
you
you
can
be
anything
you
want
as
far
as
i
concerned
i
snapped
and
went
out
holcombe
still
retained
the
front
room
i
think
although
he
said
nothing
more
about
it
that
he
was
still
playing
horse
he
wrote
a
good
bit
at
the
and
from
the
loose
sheets
of
manuscript
he
left
i
believe
actually
tried
to
begin
a
play
but
mostly
he
wandered
along
the
or
stood
on
one
or
another
of
the
bridges
looking
at
the
water
and
thinking
it
is
certain
that
he
tried
to
keep
in
the
part
by
smoking
cigarettes
but
he
hated
them
and
usually
ended
by
throwing
the
cigarette
away
and
lighting
an
old
pipe
he
carried
on
that
thursday
evening
he
came
home
and
sat
down
to
supper
with
reynolds
he
ate
little
and
seemed
much
excited
the
talk
ran
on
crime
as
it
always
did
when
he
was
around
and
holcombe
quoted
spencer
a
great
deal
herbert
spencer
reynolds
was
impressed
not
knowing
much
beyond
silks
and
the
national
league
spencer
holcombe
would
say
spencer
shows
that
every
occurrence
is
the
inevitable
result
of
what
has
gone
before
and
carries
in
its
train
an
equally
inevitable
series
of
results
try
to
interrupt
this
chain
in
the
smallest
degree
and
what
follows
chaos
my
dear
sir
chaos
we
see
that
at
the
store
reynolds
would
say
accustom
a
lot
of
women
to
a
silk
sale
on
fridays
and
then
make
it
toothbrushes
chaos
all
right
well
holcombe
came
in
that
night
about
ten
and
i
told
him
ladley
was
back
he
was
almost
wild
with
excitement
wanted
to
have
the
back
parlor
so
he
could
watch
him
through
the
keyhole
and
was
terribly
upset
when
i
told
him
there
was
no
keyhole
that
the
door
fastened
with
a
thumb
bolt
on
learning
that
the
room
was
to
be
papered
the
next
morning
he
grew
calmer
however
and
got
the
address
from
me
he
went
out
just
after
that
friday
as
i
say
was
very
quiet
ladley
moved
to
the
back
parlor
to
let
the
in
the
front
room
smoked
and
fussed
with
his
papers
all
day
and
holcombe
stayed
in
his
room
which
was
unusual
in
the
afternoon
molly
maguire
put
on
the
striped
fur
coat
and
went
out
going
slowly
past
the
house
so
that
i
would
be
sure
to
see
her
beyond
banging
the
window
down
i
gave
her
no
satisfaction
at
four
holcombe
came
to
my
kitchen
rubbing
his
hands
together
he
had
a
pasteboard
tube
in
his
hand
about
a
foot
long
with
an
arrangement
of
small
mirrors
in
it
he
said
it
was
modeled
after
the
something
or
other
that
is
used
on
a
submarine
and
that
he
and
the
had
fixed
a
place
for
it
between
his
floor
and
the
ceiling
of
ladley
room
so
that
the
chandelier
would
hide
it
from
below
he
thought
he
could
watch
ladley
through
it
and
as
it
turned
out
he
could
i
want
to
find
his
weak
moment
he
said
excitedly
i
want
to
know
what
he
does
when
the
door
is
closed
and
he
can
take
off
his
mask
and
i
want
to
know
if
he
sleeps
with
a
light
if
he
does
i
replied
i
hope
you
let
me
know
holcombe
the
gas
bills
are
a
horror
to
me
as
it
is
i
think
he
kept
it
on
all
last
night
i
turned
off
all
the
other
lights
and
went
to
the
cellar
the
meter
was
going
around
fine
he
said
every
murderer
fears
the
dark
and
our
friend
of
the
parlor
bedroom
is
a
murderer
pitman
whether
he
hangs
or
not
he
a
murderer
the
mirror
affair
which
holcombe
called
a
periscope
was
put
in
that
day
and
worked
amazingly
well
i
went
with
him
to
try
it
out
and
i
distinctly
saw
the
take
a
cigarette
from
case
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
just
after
that
ladley
sauntered
into
the
room
and
looked
at
the
new
paper
i
could
both
see
and
hear
him
it
was
rather
weird
god
what
a
he
said
chapter
viii
that
was
friday
afternoon
all
that
evening
and
most
of
saturday
and
sunday
holcombe
sat
on
the
floor
with
his
eye
to
the
reflecting
mirror
and
his
beside
him
i
have
it
before
me
on
the
first
page
is
the
dog
meat
two
dollars
entry
on
the

in
great
excitement
shortly
after

and
showed
me
the
item
neither
of
us
doubted
for
a
moment
that
it
was
jennie
brice
who
had
been
found
he
started
for
sewickley
that
same
afternoon
and
he
probably
communicated
with
the
police
before

once
or
twice
i
saw
graves
the
detective
sauntering
past
the
house
ladley
ate
no

reynolds
follow
him

they
were
both
back
in
a
reynolds
reported
that
ladley
had
bought
some
headache
tablets
and
some
bromide
powders
to
make
him
sleep
holcombe
came
back
that
evening
he
thought
the
body
was
that
of
jennie
brice
but
the
head
was
gone
he
was
much
depressed
and
did
not
immediately
go
back
to
the
periscope
i
asked
if
the
head
had
been
cut
off
or
taken
off
by
a
steamer
he
was
afraid
the
latter
as
a
hand
was
gone
too
it
was
about
eleven
that
night
that
the
rang
it
was
graves
with
a
small
man
behind
him
i
knew
the
man
he
lived
in
a
not
far
from
my
house
a
curious
affair
with
shelves
full
of
dishes
and
tinware
in
the
spring
he
would
be
towed
up
the
monongahela
a
hundred
miles
or
so
and
float
down
tying
up
at
different
landings
and
selling
his
wares
timothy
senft
was
his
name
we
called
him
tim
graves
motioned
me
to
be
quiet
both
of
us
knew
that
behind
the
parlor
door
ladley
was
probably
listening
sorry
to
get
you
up
pitman
said
graves
but
this
man
says
he
has
bought
beer
here
that
wo
do
mrs
pitman
beer
i
have
such
a
thing
in
the
house
come
in
and
look
i
snapped
and
the
two
of
them
went
back
to
the
kitchen
now
said
graves
when
i
had
shut
the
door
where
the
man
bring
him
quietly
i
called
holcombe
and
he
came
eagerly
and
all
ah
he
said
when
he
saw
tim
so
you
turned
up
yes
sir
it
seems
dog
holcombe
said
graves
that
you
are
right
partly
anyhow
tim
here
help
a
man
with
a
boat
that
night
threw
him
a
rope
sir
tim
broke
in
he
got
out
in
the
current
and
what
with
the
ice
and
his
not
knowing
much
about
a
boat
have
kept
on
to
new
orleans
if
i
had
caught
him
or
kingdom
come
exactly
and
what
time
did
you
say
this
was
between
three
and
four
last
sunday
night
or
monday
morning
he
said
he
could
sleep
and
went
out
in
a
boat
meaning
to
keep
in
close
to
shore
but
he
got
drawn
out
in
the
current
where
did
you
see
him
first
by
the
ninth
street
bridge
did
you
hail
him
he
saw
my
light
and
hailed
me
i
was
making
fast
to
a
coal
barge
after
one
of
my
ropes
had
busted
you
threw
the
line
to
him
there
no
sir
he
tried
to
work
in
to
shore
i
ran
along
river
avenue
to
below
the
sixth
street
bridge
he
got
pretty
close
in
there
and
i
threw
him
a
rope
he
was
about
done
up
would
you
know
him
again
yes
sir
he
gave
me
five
dollars
and
said
to
say
nothing
about
it
he
did
want
anybody
to
know
he
had
been
such
a
fool
they
took
him
quietly
up
stairs
then
and
let
him
look
through
the
periscope
identified
ladley
when
tim
and
graves
had
gone
holcombe
and
i
were
left
alone
in
the
kitchen
holcombe
leaned
over
and
patted
peter
as
he
lay
in
his
basket
we
got
him
old
boy
he
said
the
chain
is
just
about
complete
he
never
kick
you
again
but
holcombe
was
wrong
not
about
kicking
peter
although
i
believe
ladley
ever
did
that
again
but
in
thinking
we
had
him
i
washed
that
next
morning
monday
but
all
the
time
i
was
rubbing
and
starching
and
hanging
out
my
mind
was
with
jennie
brice
the
sight
of
molly
maguire
next
door
at
the
window
rubbing
and
brushing
at
the
fur
coat
only
made
things
worse
at
noon
when
the
maguire
youngsters
came
home
from
school
i
bribed
tommy
the
youngest
into
the
kitchen
with
the
promise
of
a
doughnut
i
see
your
mother
has
a
new
fur
coat
i
said
with
the
plate
of
doughnuts
just
beyond
his
reach
yes
she
did
buy
it
she
did
buy
it
say
pitman
gim
me
that
doughnut
oh
so
the
coat
washed
in
no
pap
found
it
down
by
the
point
on
a
cake
of
ice
he
thought
it
was
a
dog
and
rowed
out
for
it
well
i
had
wanted
the
coat
as
far
as
that
goes
i
managed
well
enough
without
furs
for
twenty
years
or
more
but
it
was
a
satisfaction
to
know
that
it
had
not
floated
into
kitchen
and
spread
itself
at
her
feet
as
one
may
say
however
that
was
not
the
question
after
all
the
real
issue
was
that
if
it
was
jennie
brice
coat
and
was
found
across
the
river
on
a
cake
of
ice
then
one
of
two
things
was
certain
either
jennie
brice
body
wrapped
in
the
coat
had
been
thrown
into
the
water
out
in
the
current
or
she
herself
hoping
to
incriminate
her
husband
had
flung
her
coat
into
the
river
i
told
holcombe
and
he
interviewed
joe
maguire
that
afternoon
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
tommy
had
been
correctly
informed
joe
had
witnesses
who
had
lined
up
to
see
him
rescue
a
dog
and
had
beheld
his
return
in
triumph
with
a
wet
and
soggy
fur
coat
at
three
maguire
instructed
by
graves
brought
the
coat
to
me
for
identification
turning
it
about
for
my
inspection
but
refusing
to
take
her
hands
off
it
if
her
husband
says
to
me
that
he
wants
it
back
well
and
good
she
said
but
i
do
give
it
up
to
nobody
but
him
some
folks
i
know
of
would
be
glad
enough
to
have
it
i
was
certain
it
was
jennie
brice
coat
but
the
maker
name
had
been
ripped
out
with
molly
holding
one
arm
and
i
the
other
we
took
it
to
ladley
door
and
knocked
he
opened
it
grumbling
i
have
asked
you
not
to
interrupt
me
he
said
with
his
pen
in
his
hand
his
eyes
fell
on
the
coat
what
that
he
asked
changing
color
i
think
it
ladley
fur
coat
i
said
he
stood
there
looking
at
it
and
thinking
then
it
ca
be
hers
he
said
she
wore
hers
when
she
went
away
perhaps
she
dropped
it
in
the
water
he
looked
at
me
and
smiled
and
why
would
she
do
that
he
asked
mockingly
was
it
out
of
fashion
that
ladley
coat
i
persisted
but
molly
maguire
jerked
it
from
me
and
started
away
he
stood
there
looking
at
me
and
smiling
in
his
nasty
way
this
excitement
is
telling
on
you
pitman
he
said
coolly
you
too
emotional
for
detective
work
then
he
went
in
and
shut
the
door
when
i
went
molly
maguire
was
waiting
in
the
kitchen
and
had
the
audacity
to
ask
me
if
i
thought
the
coat
needed
a
new
lining
it
was
on
monday
evening
that
the
strangest
event
in
years
happened
to
me
i
went
to
my
sister
house
and
the
fact
that
i
was
admitted
at
a
side
entrance
made
it
even
stranger
it
happened
in
this
way
supper
was
over
and
i
was
cleaning
up
when
an
automobile
came
to
the
door
it
was
alma
car
the
chauffeur
gave
me
a
note
dear
mrs
pitman
i
am
not
at
all
well
and
very
anxious
will
you
come
to
see
me
at
once
my
mother
is
out
to
dinner
and
i
am
alone
the
car
will
bring
you
cordially
lida
harvey
i
put
on
my
best
dress
at
once
and
got
into
the
limousine
half
the
neighborhood
was
out
watching
i
leaned
back
in
the
upholstered
seat
fairly
quivering
with
excitement
this
was
alma
car
that
was
the
little
clock
had
her
monogram
on
it
even
the
flowers
in
the
flower
holder
yellow
tulips
reminded
me
of
alma
a
trifle
showy
but
good
to
look
at
and
i
was
going
to
her
house
i
was
not
taken
to
the
main
entrance
but
to
a
side
door
the
queer
feeling
was
still
there
in
this
back
hall
relegated
from
the
more
conspicuous
part
of
the
house
there
were
even
pieces
of
furniture
from
the
old
home
and
my
father
picture
in
an
oval
gilt
frame
hung
over
my
head
i
had
not
seen
a
picture
of
him
for
twenty
years
i
went
over
and
touched
it
gently
father
father
i
said
under
it
was
the
tall
hall
chair
that
i
had
climbed
over
as
a
child
and
had
stood
on
many
times
to
see
myself
in
the
mirror
above
the
chair
was
newly
finished
and
looked
the
better
for
its
age
i
glanced
in
the
old
glass
the
chair
had
stood
time
better
than
i
was
a
woman
lined
with
poverty
and
care
shabby
prematurely
gray
a
little
hard
i
had
thought
my
father
an
old
man
when
that
picture
was
taken
and
now
i
was
even
older
father
i
whispered
again
and
fell
to
crying
in
the
dimly
lighted
hall
lida
sent
for
me
at
once
i
had
only
time
to
dry
my
eyes
and
straighten
my
hat
had
i
met
alma
on
the
stairs
i
would
have
passed
her
without
a
word
she
would
not
have
known
me
but
i
saw
no
one
lida
was
in
bed
she
was
lying
there
with
a
lamp
beside
her
and
a
great
bowl
of
spring
flowers
on
a
little
stand
at
her
elbow
she
sat
up
when
i
went
in
and
had
a
maid
place
a
chair
for
me
beside
the
bed
she
looked
very
childish
with
her
hair
in
a
braid
on
the
pillow
and
her
slim
young
arms
and
throat
bare
i
so
glad
you
came
she
said
and
would
not
be
satisfied
until
the
light
was
just
right
for
my
eyes
and
my
coat
unfastened
and
thrown
open
i
not
really
ill
she
informed
me
i
i
just
tired
and
nervous
and
and
unhappy
mrs
pitman
i
am
sorry
i
said
i
wanted
to
lean
over
and
pat
her
hand
to
draw
the
covers
around
her
and
mother
her
a
little
i
had
had
no
one
to
mother
for
so
long
but
i
could
not
she
would
have
thought
it
queer
and
presumptuous
or
no
not
that
she
was
too
sweet
to
have
thought
that
pitman
she
said
suddenly
this
jennie
brice
she
was
an
actress
she
and
her
husband
lived
at
my
house
was
she
was
she
beautiful
well
i
said
slowly
i
never
thought
of
that
she
was
handsome
in
a
large
way
was
she
young
yes
or
so
that
is
very
young
she
said
looking
relieved
but
i
think
men
like
very
young
women
do
you
i
know
one
who
does
i
said
smiling
but
she
sat
up
in
bed
suddenly
and
looked
at
me
with
her
clear
childish
eyes
i
do
want
him
to
like
me
she
flashed
i
i
want
him
to
hate
me
tut
tut
you
want
nothing
of
the
sort
pitman
she
said
i
sent
for
you
because
i
nearly
crazy
howell
was
a
friend
of
that
woman
he
has
acted
like
a
maniac
since
she
disappeared
he
does
come
to
see
me
he
has
given
up
his
work
on
the
paper
and
i
saw
him
on
the
street
he
looks
like
a
ghost
that
put
me
to
thinking
he
might
have
been
a
friend
i
admitted
although
as
far
as
i
know
he
was
never
at
the
house
but
once
and
then
he
saw
both
of
them
when
was
that
sunday
morning
the
day
before
she
disappeared
they
were
arguing
something
she
was
looking
at
me
attentively
you
know
more
than
you
are
telling
me
pitman
she
said
you
do
you
think
jennie
brice
is
dead
and
that
howell
knows
who
did
it
i
think
she
is
dead
and
i
think
possibly
howell
suspects
who
did
it
he
does
not
or
he
would
have
told
the
police
you
do
not
think
he
was
was
in
love
with
jennie
brice
do
you
i
certain
of
that
i
said
he
is
very
much
in
love
with
a
foolish
girl
who
ought
to
have
more
faith
in
him
than
she
has
illustration
she
sat
up
in
bed
suddenly
she
colored
a
little
and
smiled
at
that
but
the
next
moment
she
was
sitting
forward
tense
and
questioning
again
if
that
is
true
pitman
she
said
who
was
the
veiled
woman
he
met
that
monday
morning
at
daylight
and
took
across
the
bridge
to
pittsburgh
i
believe
it
was
jennie
brice
if
it
was
not
who
was
it
i
do
believe
he
took
any
woman
across
the
bridge
at
that
hour
who
says
he
did
uncle
jim
saw
him
he
had
been
playing
cards
all
night
at
one
of
the
clubs
and
was
walking
home
he
says
he
met
howell
face
to
face
and
spoke
to
him
the
woman
was
tall
and
veiled
uncle
jim
sent
for
him
a
day
or
two
later
and
he
refused
to
explain
then
they
forbade
him
the
house
mama
objected
to
him
anyhow
and
he
only
came
on
sufferance
he
is
a
college
man
of
good
family
but
without
any
money
at
all
save
what
he
and
now
i
had
had
some
young
newspaper
men
with
me
and
i
knew
what
they
got
they
were
nice
boys
but
they
made
fifteen
dollars
a
week
afraid
i
smiled
a
little
as
i
looked
around
the
room
with
its
gray
walls
its
spread
with
ivory
and
gold
and
the
maid
in
attendance
in
her
black
dress
and
white
apron
collar
and
cuffs
even
the
little
nightgown
lida
was
wearing
would
have
taken
a
week
salary
or
more
she
saw
my
smile
it
was
to
be
his
chance
she
said
if
he
made
good
he
was
to
have
something
better
my
uncle
jim
owns
the
paper
and
he
promised
me
to
help
him
but
so
jim
was
running
a
newspaper
that
was
a
curious
career
for
jim
to
choose
jim
who
was
twice
expelled
from
school
and
who
could
never
write
a
letter
without
a
dictionary
beside
him
i
had
a
pang
when
i
heard
his
name
again
after
all
the
years
for
i
had
written
to
jim
from
oklahoma
after
pitman
died
asking
for
money
to
bury
him
and
had
never
even
had
a
reply
and
you
have
seen
him
since
once
i
did
hear
from
him
and
i
called
him
up
we
we
met
in
the
park
he
said
everything
was
all
right
but
he
could
tell
me
just
then
the
next
day
he
resigned
from
the
paper
and
went
away
pitman
it
driving
me
crazy
for
they
have
found
a
body
and
they
think
it
is
hers
if
it
is
and
he
was
with
her
do
be
a
foolish
girl
i
protested
if
he
was
with
jennie
brice
she
is
still
living
and
if
he
was
with
jennie
brice
if
it
was
jennie
brice
then
i
have
a
right
to
know
who
it
was
she
declared
he
was
not
like
himself
when
i
met
him
he
said
such
queer
things
he
talked
about
an
onyx
clock
and
said
he
had
been
made
a
fool
of
and
that
no
matter
what
came
out
i
was
always
to
remember
that
he
had
done
what
he
did
for
the
best
and
that
that
he
cared
for
me
more
than
for
anything
in
this
world
or
the
next
that
was
so
foolish
i
could
help
it
i
leaned
over
and
drew
her
nightgown
up
over
her
bare
white
shoulder
you
wo
help
anything
or
anybody
by
taking
cold
my
dear
i
said
call
your
maid
and
have
her
put
a
around
you
i
left
soon
after
there
was
little
i
could
do
but
i
comforted
her
as
best
i
could
and
said
good
night
my
heart
was
heavy
as
i
went
down
the
stairs
for
twist
things
as
i
might
it
was
clear
that
in
some
way
the
howell
boy
was
mixed
up
in
the
brice
case
poor
little
troubled
lida
poor
distracted
boy
i
had
a
curious
experience
i
had
reached
the
foot
of
the
staircase
and
was
turning
to
go
back
and
along
the
hall
to
the
side
entrance
when
i
came
face
to
face
with
isaac
the
old
colored
man
who
had
driven
the
family
carriage
when
i
was
a
child
and
whom
i
had
seen
at
intervals
since
i
came
back
pottering
around
alma
house
the
old
man
was
bent
and
feeble
he
came
slowly
down
the
hall
with
a
bunch
of
keys
in
his
hand
i
had
seen
him
do
the
same
thing
many
times
he
stopped
when
he
saw
me
and
i
shrank
back
from
the
light
but
he
had
seen
me
miss
bess
he
said
foh
gawd
sake
miss
bess
you
are
making
a
mistake
my
friend
i
said
quivering
i
am
not
bess
he
came
close
to
me
and
stared
into
my
face
and
from
that
he
looked
at
my
cloth
gloves
at
my
coat
and
he
shook
his
white
head
i
sure
thought
you
was
miss
bess
he
said
and
made
no
further
effort
to
detain
me
he
led
the
way
back
to
the
door
where
the
machine
waited
his
head
shaking
with
the
palsy
of
age
muttering
as
he
went
he
opened
the
door
with
his
best
manner
and
stood
aside
good
night
he
quavered
i
had
tears
in
my
eyes
i
tried
to
keep
them
back
good
night
i
said
good
night
it
had
slipped
out
my
baby
name
for
old
isaac
miss
bess
he
cried
oh
praise
gawd
it
miss
bess
again
he
caught
my
arm
and
pulled
me
back
into
the
hall
and
there
he
held
me
crying
over
me
muttering
praises
for
my
return
begging
me
to
come
back
recalling
little
tender
things
out
of
the
past
that
almost
killed
me
to
hear
again
but
i
had
made
my
bed
and
must
lie
in
it
i
forced
him
to
swear
silence
about
my
visit
i
made
him
promise
not
to
reveal
my
identity
to
lida
and
i
told
him
heaven
forgive
me
that
i
was
well
and
prosperous
and
happy
dear
old
isaac
i
would
not
let
him
come
to
see
me
but
the
next
day
there
came
a
basket
with
six
bottles
of
wine
and
an
old
daguerreotype
of
my
mother
that
had
been
his
treasure
nor
was
that
basket
the
last
chapter
ix
the
coroner
held
an
inquest
over
the
headless
body
the
next
day
tuesday
graves
telephoned
me
in
the
morning
and
i
went
to
the
morgue
with
him
i
do
not
like
the
morgue
although
some
of
my
neighbors
pay
it
weekly
visits
it
is
by
way
of
excursion
like
nickelodeons
or
watching
the
circus
put
up
its
tents
i
have
heard
them
threaten
the
children
that
if
they
misbehaved
they
would
not
be
taken
to
the
morgue
that
week
i
failed
to
identify
the
body
how
could
i
it
had
been
a
tall
woman
probably
five
feet
eight
and
i
thought
the
nails
looked
like
those
of
jennie
brice
the
of
one
was
broken
short
off
i
told
graves
about
her
speaking
of
a
broken
nail
but
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
nothing
there
was
a
curious
scar
over
the
heart
and
he
was
making
a
sketch
of
it
it
reached
from
the
center
of
the
chest
for
about
six
inches
across
the
left
breast
a
narrow
thin
line
that
one
could
hardly
see
it
was
shaped
like
this
i
felt
sure
that
jennie
brice
had
had
no
such
scar
and
graves
thought
as
i
did
temple
hope
called
to
the
inquest
said
she
had
never
heard
of
one
and
ladley
himself
at
the
inquest
swore
that
his
wife
had
had
nothing
of
the
sort
i
was
watching
him
and
i
did
not
think
he
was
lying
and
yet
the
hand
was
very
like
jennie
brice
it
was
all
bewildering
ladley
testimoney
at
the
inquest
was
disappointing
he
was
cool
and
collected
said
he
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
his
wife
was
dead
and
less
reason
to
think
she
had
been
drowned
she
had
left
him
in
a
rage
and
if
she
found
out
that
by
hiding
she
was
putting
him
in
an
unpleasant
position
she
would
probably
hide
indefinitely
to
the
disappointment
of
everybody
the
identity
of
the
woman
remained
a
mystery
no
one
with
such
a
scar
was
missing
a
small
woman
of
my
own
age
a
murray
whose
daughter
a
stenographer
had
disappeared
attended
the
inquest
but
her
daughter
had
had
no
such
scar
and
had
worn
her
nails
short
because
of
using
the
typewriter
alice
murray
was
the
missing
girl
name
her
mother
sat
beside
me
and
cried
most
of
the
time
one
thing
was
brought
out
at
the
inquest
the
body
had
been
thrown
into
the
river
death
there
was
no
water
in
the
lungs
the
verdict
was
death
by
the
hands
of
some
person
or
persons
unknown
holcombe
was
not
satisfied
in
some
way
or
other
he
had
got
permission
to
attend
the
autopsy
and
had
brought
away
a
tracing
of
the
scar
all
the
way
home
in
the
he
stared
at
the
drawing
holding
first
one
eye
shut
and
then
the
other
but
like
the
coroner
he
got
nowhere
he
folded
the
paper
and
put
it
in
his
none
the
less
pitman
he
said
that
is
the
body
of
jennie
brice
her
husband
killed
her
probably
by
strangling
her
he
took
the
body
out
in
the
boat
and
dropped
it
into
the
swollen
river
above
the
ninth
street
bridge
why
do
you
think
he
strangled
her
there
was
no
mark
on
the
body
and
no
poison
was
found
then
if
he
strangled
her
where
did
the
blood
come
from
i
did
limit
myself
to
strangulation
he
said
irritably
he
may
have
cut
her
throat
or
brained
her
with
my
onyx
clock
i
added
with
a
sigh
for
i
missed
the
clock
more
and
more
he
went
down
in
his
pockets
and
brought
up
a
key
i
forgotten
this
he
said
it
shows
you
were
right
that
the
clock
was
there
when
the
ladleys
took
the
room
i
found
this
in
the
yard
this
morning
it
was
when
i
got
home
from
the
inquest
that
i
found
old
basket
waiting
i
am
not
a
crying
woman
but
i
could
hardly
see
my
mother
picture
for
well
after
all
that
is
not
the
brice
story
i
am
not
writing
the
sordid
tragedy
of
my
life
that
was
on
tuesday
jennie
brice
had
been
missing
nine
days
in
all
that
time
although
she
was
cast
for
the
piece
at
the
theater
that
week
no
one
there
had
heard
from
her
her
relatives
had
had
no
word
she
had
gone
away
if
she
had
gone
on
a
cold
march
night
in
a
striped
black
and
white
dress
with
a
red
collar
and
a
red
and
black
hat
without
her
fur
coat
which
she
had
worn
all
winter
she
had
gone
very
early
in
the
morning
or
during
the
night
how
had
she
gone
ladley
said
he
had
rowed
her
to
federal
street
at
half
after
six
and
had
brought
the
boat
back
after
they
had
quarreled
violently
all
night
and
when
she
was
leaving
him
would
he
have
allowed
her
to
take
herself
away
besides
the
police
had
found
no
trace
of
her
on
an
early
train
and
then
at
daylight
between
five
and
six
my
own
brother
had
seen
a
woman
with
howell
a
woman
who
might
have
been
jennie
brice
but
if
it
was
why
did
not
howell
say
so
ladley
claimed
she
was
hiding
in
revenge
but
jennie
brice
was
not
that
sort
of
woman
there
was
something
big
about
her
something
that
is
found
often
in
large
women
a
lack
of
spite
she
was
not
petty
or
malicious
her
faults
like
her
virtues
were
for
all
to
see
in
spite
of
the
failure
to
identify
the
body
ladley
was
arrested
that
night
tuesday
and
this
time
it
was
for
murder
i
know
now
that
the
police
were
taking
long
chances
they
had
no
strong
motive
for
the
crime
as
holcombe
said
they
had
provocation
but
not
motive
which
is
different
they
had
opportunity
and
they
had
a
lot
of
straggling
links
of
clues
which
in
the
total
made
a
fair
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
but
that
was
all
that
is
the
way
the
case
stood
on
tuesday
night
march
the
thirteenth
ladley
was
taken
away
at
nine
he
was
perfectly
cool
asked
me
to
help
him
pack
a
suit
case
and
whistled
while
it
was
being
done
he
requested
to
be
allowed
to
walk
to
the
jail
and
went
quietly
with
a
detective
on
one
side
and
i
think
a
sheriff
officer
on
the
other
just
before
he
left
he
asked
for
a
word
or
two
with
me
and
when
he
paid
his
bill
up
to
date
and
gave
me
an
extra
dollar
for
taking
care
of
peter
i
was
almost
overcome
he
took
the
manuscript
of
his
play
with
him
and
i
remember
his
asking
if
he
could
have
any
typing
done
in
the
jail
i
had
never
seen
a
man
arrested
for
murder
before
but
i
think
he
was
probably
the
coolest
suspect
the
officers
had
ever
seen
they
hardly
knew
what
to
make
of
it
reynolds
and
i
had
a
cup
of
tea
after
all
the
excitement
and
were
sitting
at
the
table
drinking
it
when
the
bell
rang
it
was
howell
he
half
staggered
into
the
hall
when
i
opened
the
door
and
was
for
going
into
the
parlor
bedroom
without
a
word
ladley
gone
if
you
want
him
i
said
i
thought
his
face
cleared
gone
he
said
where
to
jail
he
did
not
reply
at
once
he
stood
there
tapping
the
palm
of
one
hand
with
the
forefinger
of
the
other
he
was
dirty
and
unshaven
his
clothes
looked
as
if
he
had
been
sleeping
in
them
so
they
got
him
he
muttered
finally
and
turning
was
about
to
go
out
the
front
door
without
another
word
but
i
caught
his
arm
you
sick
howell
i
said
you
better
not
go
out
just
yet
oh
i
all
right
he
took
his
handkerchief
out
and
wiped
his
face
i
saw
that
his
hands
were
shaking
come
back
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
slice
of
bread
he
hesitated
and
looked
at
his
watch
i
do
it
pitman
he
said
i
suppose
i
better
throw
a
little
fuel
into
this
engine
of
mine
it
been
going
hard
for
several
days
he
ate
like
a
wolf
i
cut
half
a
loaf
into
slices
for
him
and
he
drank
the
rest
of
the
tea
reynolds
creaked
up
to
bed
and
left
him
still
eating
and
me
still
cutting
and
spreading
now
that
i
had
a
chance
to
see
him
i
was
shocked
the
rims
of
his
eyes
were
red
his
collar
was
black
and
his
hair
hung
over
his
forehead
but
when
he
finally
sat
back
and
looked
at
me
his
color
was
better
so
they
canned
him
he
said
time
enough
too
said
i
he
leaned
forward
and
put
both
his
elbows
on
the
table
pitman
he
said
earnestly
i
do
like
him
any
more
than
you
do
but
he
never
killed
that
woman
somebody
killed
her
how
do
you
know
how
do
you
know
she
is
dead
well
i
did
of
course
i
only
felt
it
the
police
have
even
proved
a
crime
they
ca
hold
a
man
for
a
supposititious
murder
perhaps
they
ca
but
they
doing
it
i
retorted
if
the
alive
she
wo
let
him
hang
i
not
so
sure
of
that
he
said
heavily
and
got
up
he
looked
in
the
little
mirror
over
the
sideboard
and
brushed
back
his
hair
i
look
bad
enough
he
said
but
i
feel
worse
well
you
saved
my
life
pitman
thank
you
how
is
my
how
is
miss
harvey
i
asked
as
we
started
out
he
turned
and
smiled
at
me
in
his
boyish
way
the
best
ever
he
said
i
have
seen
her
for
days
and
it
seems
like
centuries
she
she
is
the
only
girl
in
the
world
for
me
pitman
although
i
he
stopped
and
drew
a
long
breath
she
is
beautiful
is
she
very
beautiful
i
answered
her
mother
was
always
her
mother
he
looked
at
me
curiously
i
knew
her
mother
years
ago
i
said
putting
the
best
face
on
my
mistake
that
i
could
then
i
remember
you
to
her
if
she
ever
allows
me
to
see
her
again
just
now
i
non
if
you
do
the
kindly
thing
howell
i
said
you
me
to
her
he
looked
into
my
eyes
and
then
thrust
out
his
hand
all
right
he
said
i
not
ask
any
questions
i
guess
there
are
some
curious
stories
hidden
in
these
old
houses
peter
hobbled
to
the
front
door
with
him
he
had
not
gone
so
far
as
the
parlor
once
while
ladley
was
in
the
house
they
had
had
a
sale
of
spring
flowers
at
the
store
that
day
and
reynolds
had
brought
me
a
pot
of
white
tulips
that
night
i
hung
my
mother
picture
over
the
mantel
in
the
and
put
the
tulips
beneath
it
it
gave
me
a
feeling
of
comfort
i
had
never
seen
my
mother
grave
or
put
flowers
on
it
chapter
x
i
have
said
before
that
i
do
not
know
anything
about
the
law
i
believe
that
the
ladley
case
was
unusual
in
several
ways
ladley
had
once
been
well
known
in
new
york
among
the
people
who
frequent
the
theaters
and
jennie
brice
was
even
better
known
a
good
many
lawyers
i
believe
said
that
the
police
had
not
a
leg
to
stand
on
and
i
know
the
case
was
watched
with
much
interest
by
the
legal
profession
people
wrote
letters
to
the
newspapers
protesting
against
ladley
being
held
and
i
believe
that
the
district
attorney
in
taking
him
before
the
grand
jury
hardly
hoped
to
make
a
case
but
he
did
to
his
own
surprise
i
fancy
and
the
trial
was
set
for
may
but
in
the
meantime
many
curious
things
happened
in
the
first
place
the
week
following
ladley
arrest
my
house
was
filled
up
with
eight
or
ten
members
of
a
company
from
the
gaiety
theater
very
cheerful
and
jolly
and
well
behaved
three
men
i
think
and
the
rest
girls
one
of
the
men
was
named
bellows
john
bellows
and
it
turned
out
that
he
had
known
jennie
brice
very
well
from
the
moment
he
learned
that
holcombe
hardly
left
him
he
walked
to
the
theater
with
him
and
waited
to
walk
home
again
he
took
him
out
to
restaurants
and
for
long
rides
in
the
mornings
and
on
the
last
night
of
their
stay
saturday
they
got
gloriously
drunk
together
holcombe
no
doubt
in
his
character
of
ladley
and
came
reeling
in
at
three
in
the
morning
singing
holcombe
was
very
sick
the
next
day
but
by
monday
he
was
all
right
and
he
called
me
into
the
room
we
got
him
pitman
he
said
looking
mottled
but
cheerful
as
sure
as
god
made
little
fishes
we
got
him
that
was
all
he
would
say
however
it
seemed
he
was
going
to
new
york
and
might
be
gone
for
a
month
i
no
family
he
said
and
enough
money
to
keep
me
if
i
find
my
relaxation
in
hunting
down
criminals
it
a
harmless
and
cheap
amusement
and
it
my
own
business
he
went
away
that
night
and
i
must
admit
i
missed
him
i
rented
the
parlor
bedroom
the
next
day
to
a
and
i
found
the
periscope
affair
very
handy
i
could
see
just
how
much
gas
she
used
and
although
the
notice
on
each
door
forbids
cooking
and
washing
in
rooms
i
found
she
was
doing
both
making
coffee
and
boiling
an
egg
in
the
morning
and
rubbing
out
stockings
and
handkerchiefs
in
her
i
much
rather
have
men
as
boarders
than
women
the
women
are
always
lighting
alcohol
lamps
on
the
bureau
and
wanting
the
bed
turned
into
a
cozy
corner
so
they
can
see
their
gentlemen
friends
in
their
rooms
well
with
holcombe
gone
and
reynolds
busy
all
day
and
half
the
night
getting
out
the
summer
silks
and
preparing
for
remnant
day
and
with
ladley
in
jail
and
lida
out
of
the
city
for
i
saw
in
the
papers
that
she
was
not
well
and
her
mother
had
taken
her
to
bermuda
i
had
a
good
bit
of
time
on
my
hands
and
so
i
got
in
the
habit
of
thinking
things
over
and
trying
to
draw
conclusions
as
i
had
seen
holcombe
do
i
would
sit
down
and
write
things
out
as
they
had
happened
and
study
them
over
and
especially
i
worried
over
how
we
could
have
found
a
slip
of
paper
in
ladley
room
with
a
list
almost
exact
of
the
things
we
had
discovered
there
i
used
to
read
it
over
rope
knife
shoe
towel
horn
and
get
more
and
more
bewildered
horn
might
have
been
a
town
or
it
might
not
have
been
there
such
a
town
according
to
graves
but
apparently
he
had
made
nothing
of
it
it
a
town
that
was
meant
the
dictionary
gave
only
a
few
words
beginning
with
horn
hornet
hornblende
hornpipe
and
horny
none
of
which
was
of
any
assistance
and
then
one
morning
i
happened
to
see
in
the
personal
column
of
one
of
the
newspapers
that
a
woman
named
eliza
shaeffer
of
horner
had
buff
orpington
and
plymouth
rock
chicks
for
sale
and
it
started
me
to
puzzling
again
perhaps
it
had
been
horner
and
possibly
this
very
eliza
shaeffer
i
suppose
my
lack
of
experience
was
in
my
favor
for
after
all
eliza
shaeffer
is
a
common
enough
name
and
the
horn
might
have
stood
for
hornswoggle
for
all
i
knew
the
story
of
the
man
who
thought
of
what
he
would
do
if
he
were
a
horse
came
back
to
me
and
for
an
hour
or
so
i
tried
to
think
i
was
jennie
brice
trying
to
get
away
and
hide
from
my
rascal
of
a
husband
but
i
made
no
headway
i
would
never
have
gone
to
horner
or
to
any
small
town
if
i
had
wanted
to
hide
i
think
i
should
have
gone
around
the
corner
and
taken
a
room
in
my
own
neighborhood
or
have
lost
myself
in
some
large
city
it
was
that
same
day
that
since
i
did
not
go
to
horner
horner
came
to
me
the
bell
rang
about
three
and
i
answered
it
myself
for
with
times
hard
and
only
two
or
three
roomers
all
winter
i
had
not
had
a
servant
except
terry
to
do
odd
jobs
for
some
months
there
stood
a
young
girl
with
a
covered
basket
in
her
hand
are
you
mrs
pitman
she
asked
i
do
need
anything
i
said
trying
to
shut
the
door
and
at
that
minute
something
in
the
basket
cheeped
young
women
selling
poultry
are
not
common
in
our
neighborhood
what
have
you
there
i
asked
more
agreeably
chicks
chicks
but
i
not
trying
to
sell
you
any
i
may
i
come
in
it
was
dawning
on
me
then
that
perhaps
this
was
eliza
shaeffer
i
led
her
back
to
the
with
peter
sniffing
at
the
basket
my
name
is
shaeffer
she
said
i
seen
your
name
in
the
papers
and
i
believe
i
know
something
about
jennie
brice
eliza
shaeffer
story
was
curious
she
said
that
she
was
postmistress
at
horner
and
lived
with
her
mother
on
a
farm
a
mile
out
of
the
town
driving
in
and
out
each
day
in
a
buggy
on
monday
afternoon
march
the
fifth
a
woman
had
alighted
at
the
station
from
a
train
and
had
taken
luncheon
at
the
hotel
she
told
the
clerk
she
was
on
the
road
selling
corsets
and
was
much
disappointed
to
find
no
store
of
any
size
in
the
town
the
woman
who
had
registered
as
jane
bellows
said
she
was
tired
and
would
like
to
rest
for
a
day
or
two
on
a
farm
she
was
told
to
see
eliza
shaeffer
at
the
and
as
a
result
drove
out
with
her
to
the
farm
after
the
last
mail
came
in
that
evening
asked
to
describe
her
she
was
over
medium
height
quick
in
her
movements
and
wore
a
black
and
white
striped
dress
with
a
red
collar
and
a
hat
to
match
she
carried
a
small
brown
valise
that
miss
shaeffer
presumed
contained
her
samples
shaeffer
had
made
her
welcome
although
they
did
not
usually
take
boarders
until
june
she
had
not
eaten
much
supper
and
that
night
she
had
asked
for
pen
and
ink
and
had
written
a
letter
the
letter
was
not
mailed
until
wednesday
all
of
tuesday
bellows
had
spent
in
her
room
and
shaeffer
had
driven
to
the
village
in
the
afternoon
with
word
that
she
had
been
crying
all
day
and
bought
some
headache
medicine
for
her
on
wednesday
morning
however
she
had
appeared
at
breakfast
eaten
heartily
and
had
asked
miss
shaeffer
to
take
her
letter
to
the
it
was
addressed
to
ellis
howell
in
care
of
a
pittsburgh
newspaper
that
night
when
miss
eliza
went
home
about
half
past
eight
the
woman
was
gone
she
had
paid
for
her
room
and
had
been
driven
as
far
as
thornville
where
all
trace
of
her
had
been
lost
on
account
of
the
disappearance
of
jennie
brice
being
published
shortly
after
that
she
and
her
mother
had
driven
to
thornville
but
the
station
agent
there
was
surly
as
well
as
stupid
they
had
learned
nothing
about
the
woman
since
that
time
three
men
had
made
inquiries
about
the
woman
in
question
one
had
a
pointed
vandyke
beard
the
second
from
the
description
i
fancied
must
have
been
graves
the
third
without
doubt
was
howell
eliza
shaeffer
said
that
this
last
man
had
seemed
half
frantic
i
brought
her
a
photograph
of
jennie
brice
as
topsy
and
another
one
as
juliet
she
said
there
was
a
resemblance
but
that
it
ended
there
but
of
course
as
graves
had
said
by
the
time
an
actress
gets
her
photograph
retouched
to
suit
her
it
particularly
resemble
her
and
unless
i
had
known
jennie
brice
myself
i
should
hardly
have
recognized
the
pictures
well
in
spite
of
all
that
there
seemed
no
doubt
that
jennie
brice
had
been
living
three
days
after
her
disappearance
and
that
would
clear
ladley
but
what
had
howell
to
do
with
it
all
why
had
he
not
told
the
police
of
the
letter
from
horner
or
about
the
woman
on
the
bridge
why
had
bronson
who
was
likely
the
man
with
the
pointed
beard
said
nothing
about
having
traced
jennie
brice
to
horner
i
did
as
i
thought
holcombe
would
have
wished
me
to
do
i
wrote
down
on
a
clean
sheet
of
all
that
eliza
shaeffer
said
the
description
of
the
black
and
white
dress
the
woman
height
and
the
rest
and
then
i
took
her
to
the
chicks
and
all
and
she
told
her
story
there
to
one
of
the
assistant
district
attorneys
the
young
man
was
interested
but
not
convinced
he
had
her
story
taken
down
and
she
signed
it
he
was
smiling
as
he
bowed
us
out
i
turned
in
the
doorway
this
will
free
ladley
i
suppose
i
asked
not
just
yet
he
said
pleasantly
this
makes
just
eleven
places
where
jennie
brice
spent
the
first
three
days
after
her
death
but
i
can
positively
identify
the
dress
my
good
woman
that
dress
has
been
described
to
the
last
stilted
arch
and
colonial
volute
in
every
newspaper
in
the
united
states
that
evening
the
newspapers
announced
that
during
a
conference
at
the
jail
between
ladley
and
james
bronson
business
manager
at
the
liberty
theater
ladley
had
attacked
bronson
with
a
chair
and
almost
brained
him
chapter
xi
eliza
shaeffer
went
back
to
horner
after
delivering
her
chicks
somewhere
in
the
city
things
went
on
as
before
the
trial
was
set
for
may
the
district
attorney
office
had
all
the
things
we
had
found
in
the
house
that
monday
afternoon
the
stained
towel
the
broken
knife
and
its
blade
the
slipper
that
had
been
floating
in
the
parlor
and
the
rope
that
had
fastened
my
boat
to
the
staircase
somewhere
wherever
they
keep
such
things
was
the
headless
body
of
a
woman
with
a
hand
missing
and
with
a
curious
scar
across
the
left
breast
the
slip
of
paper
however
which
i
had
found
behind
the
was
still
in
holcombe
possession
nor
had
he
mentioned
it
to
the
police
holcombe
had
not
come
back
he
wrote
me
twice
asking
me
to
hold
his
room
once
from
new
york
and
once
from
chicago
to
the
second
letter
he
added
a
postscript
have
not
found
what
i
wanted
but
am
getting
warm
if
any
news
address
me
at
des
moines
iowa
general
delivery
it
was
nearly
the
end
of
april
when
i
saw
lida
again
i
had
seen
by
the
newspapers
that
she
and
her
mother
were
coming
home
i
wondered
if
she
had
heard
from
howell
for
i
had
not
and
i
wondered
too
if
she
would
send
for
me
again
but
she
came
herself
on
foot
late
one
afternoon
and
the
being
out
i
took
her
into
the
parlor
bedroom
she
looked
thinner
than
before
and
rather
white
my
heart
ached
for
her
i
have
been
away
she
explained
i
thought
you
might
wonder
why
you
did
not
hear
from
me
but
you
see
my
mother
she
stopped
and
flushed
i
would
have
written
you
from
bermuda
but
my
mother
watched
my
correspondence
so
i
could
not
no
i
knew
she
could
not
alma
had
once
found
a
letter
of
mine
to
pitman
very
little
escaped
alma
i
wondered
if
you
have
heard
anything
she
asked
i
have
heard
nothing
howell
was
here
once
just
after
i
saw
you
i
do
not
believe
he
is
in
the
city
perhaps
not
although
pitman
i
believe
he
is
in
the
city
hiding
hiding
why
i
do
know
but
last
night
i
thought
i
saw
him
below
my
window
i
opened
the
window
so
if
it
were
he
he
could
make
some
sign
but
he
moved
on
without
a
word
later
whoever
it
was
came
back
i
put
out
my
light
and
watched
some
one
stood
there
in
the
shadow
until
after
two
this
morning
part
of
the
time
he
was
looking
up
do
you
think
had
it
been
he
he
would
have
spoken
when
he
saw
you
she
shook
her
head
he
is
in
trouble
she
said
he
has
not
heard
from
me
and
he
thinks
i
do
care
any
more
just
look
at
me
pitman
do
i
look
as
if
i
do
care
she
looked
half
killed
poor
lamb
he
may
be
out
of
town
searching
for
a
better
position
i
tried
to
comfort
her
he
wants
to
have
something
to
offer
more
than
himself
i
only
want
him
she
said
looking
at
me
frankly
i
do
know
why
i
tell
you
all
this
but
you
are
so
kind
and
i
talk
to
some
one
she
sat
there
in
the
cozy
corner
the
had
made
with
a
portière
and
some
cushions
and
i
saw
she
was
about
ready
to
break
down
and
cry
i
went
over
to
her
and
took
her
hand
for
she
was
my
own
niece
although
she
did
suspect
it
and
i
had
never
had
a
child
of
my
own
but
after
all
i
could
not
help
her
much
i
could
only
assure
her
that
he
would
come
back
and
explain
everything
and
that
he
was
all
right
and
that
the
last
time
i
had
seen
him
he
had
spoken
of
her
and
had
said
she
was
the
best
ever
my
heart
fairly
yearned
over
the
girl
and
i
think
she
felt
it
for
she
kissed
me
shyly
when
she
was
leaving
with
the
newspaper
files
before
me
it
is
not
hard
to
give
the
details
of
that
sensational
trial
it
commenced
on
monday
the
seventh
of
may
but
it
was
late
wednesday
when
the
jury
was
finally
selected
i
was
at
the
early
on
thursday
and
so
was
reynolds
the
district
attorney
made
a
short
speech
we
propose
gentlemen
to
prove
that
the
prisoner
philip
ladley
murdered
his
wife
he
said
in
part
we
will
show
first
that
a
crime
was
committed
then
we
will
show
a
motive
for
this
crime
and
finally
we
expect
to
show
that
the
body
washed
ashore
at
sewickley
is
the
body
of
the
murdered
woman
and
thus
establish
beyond
doubt
the
prisoner
guilt
ladley
listened
with
attention
he
wore
the
brown
suit
and
looked
well
and
cheerful
he
was
much
more
like
a
spectator
than
a
prisoner
and
he
was
not
so
nervous

lay

and
dropped
into
a
doze
how
long
did
you
sleep
an
hour
or
so
reynolds
a
boarder
roused
me
to
say
he
had
heard
some
one
rowing
a
boat
in
the
lower
hall
do
you

a
boat
around

went
to
the
top
of
the
stairs

boat

gone

the
boat
secured
yes
sir
anyhow
there
was
no
current

did
you
do
then
i
waited
a
time
and
went
back
to
my
room

examination
of
the
house
did
you
make
if
any
reynolds
looked
around
what
did
he
find
he
found
peter
the
ladleys
dog
shut
in
a
room
on
the
third
floor
was
there
anything
unusual
about
that
i
had
never
known
it
to
happen
before
state
what
happened
later
i
did
not
go
to
sleep
again
at
a
quarter
after
four
i
heard
the
boat
come
back
i
took
a
candle
and
went
to
the
stairs
it
was
ladley
he
said
he
had
been
out
getting
medicine
for
his
wife
did
you
see
him
tie
up
the
boat
yes
did
you
observe
any
stains
on
the
rope
i
did
not
notice
any
what
was
the
prisoner
manner
at
that
time
i
thought
he
was
surly
now
pitman
tell
us
about
the
following
morning
i
saw
ladley
at
a
quarter
before
seven
he
said
to
bring
breakfast
for
one
his
wife
had
gone
away
i
asked
if
she
was
not
ill
and
he
said
no
that
she
had
gone
away
early
that
he
had
rowed
her
to
federal
street
and
that
she
would
be
back
saturday
it
was
shortly
after
that
that
the
dog
peter
brought
in
one
of
slippers
you
recognized
the
slipper
positively
i
had
seen
it
often
what
did
you
do
with
it
i
took
it
to
mr
ladley
what
did
he
say
he
said
at
first
that
it
was
not
hers
then
he
said
if
it
was
she
would
never
wear
it
again
and
then
added
because
it
was
ruined
did
he
offer
any
statement
as
to
where
his
wife
was
no
sir
not
at
that
time
before
he
had
said
she
had
gone
away
for
a
few
days
tell
the
jury
about
the
broken
knife
the
dog
found
it
floating
in
the
parlor
with
the
blade
broken
you
had
not
left
it
no
sir
i
had
used
it
the
night
before
and
left
it
on
a
mantel
of
the
room
i
was
using
as
a
temporary
kitchen
was
the
door
of
this
room
locked
no
it
was
standing
open
were
you
not
asleep
in
this
room
yes
you
heard
no
one
come
in
no
one
until
reynolds
roused
me
where
did
you
find
the
blade
behind
the
bed
in
ladley
room
what
else
did
you
find
in
the
room
a
towel
behind
the
also
my
onyx
clock
was
missing
where
was
the
clock
when
the
ladleys
were
moved
up
into
this
room
on
the
mantel
i
wound
it
just
before
they
came
when
you
saw
ladley
on
sunday
did
she
say
she
was
going
away
no
sir
did
you
see
any
preparation
for
a
journey
the
black
and
white
dress
was
laid
out
on
the
bed
and
a
small
bag
she
said
she
was
taking
the
dress
to
the
theater
to
lend
to
miss
hope
is
that
all
she
said
no
she
said
she
been
wishing
her
husband
would
drown
that
he
was
a
fiend
i
could
see
that
my
testimony
had
made
an
impression
chapter
xii
the
slipper
the
rope
the
towel
and
the
knife
and
blade
were
produced
in
court
and
i
identified
them
all
they
made
a
noticeable
impression
on
the
jury
then
llewellyn
the
lawyer
for
the
defense
me
is
it
not
true
pitman
he
said
that
many
articles
particularly
shoes
and
slippers
are
found
floating
around
during
a
flood
yes
i
admitted
now
you
say
the
dog
found
this
slipper
floating
in
the
hall
and
brought
it
to
you
are
you
sure
this
slipper
belonged
to
jennie
brice
she
wore
it
i
presume
it
belonged
to
her
ahem
now
pitman
after
the
ladleys
had
been
moved
to
the
upper
floor
did
you
search
their
bedroom
and
the
connecting
room
no
sir
ah
then
how
do
you
know
that
this
slipper
was
not
left
on
the
floor
or
in
a
closet
it
is
possible
but
not
likely
anyhow
it
was
not
the
slipper
alone
it
was
the
other
things
the
slipper
it
was
exactly
now
pitman
this
knife
can
you
identify
it
positively
i
can
but
is
it
true
that
this
is
a
very
common
sort
of
knife
one
that
nearly
every
housewife
has
in
her
possession
yes
sir
but
that
knife
handle
has
three
notches
in
it
i
put
the
notches
there
myself
before
this
presumed
crime
yes
sir
for
what
purpose
my
neighbors
were
constantly
borrowing
things
it
was
a
means
of
identification
then
this
knife
is
yours
yes
tell
again
where
you
left
it
the
night
before
it
was
found
floating
on
a
shelf
over
the
stove
could
the
dog
have
reached
it
there
not
without
standing
on
a
hot
stove
is
it
not
possible
that
ladley
unable
to
untie
the
boat
borrowed
your
knife
to
cut
the
boat
painter
no
painter
was
cut
that
i
heard
about
the
no
no
the
boat
painter
the
rope
oh
well
he
might
have
he
never
said
now
then
this
towel
pitman
did
not
the
prisoner
on
the
following
day
tell
you
that
he
had
cut
his
wrist
in
freeing
the
boat
and
ask
you
for
some
he
did
not
i
said
firmly
you
have
not
seen
a
scar
on
his
wrist
no
i
glanced
at
ladley
he
was
smiling
as
if
amused
it
made
me
angry
and
what
more
i
flashed
if
he
has
a
cut
on
his
wrist
he
put
it
there
himself
to
account
for
the
towel
i
was
sorry
the
next
moment
that
i
had
said
it
but
it
was
too
late
the
counsel
for
the
defense
moved
to
exclude
the
answer
and
i
received
a
caution
that
i
deserved
then
you
saw
ladley
when
he
brought
your
boat
back
yes
what
time
was
that
a
quarter
after
four
monday
morning
did
he
come
in
quietly
like
a
man
trying
to
avoid
attention
not
particularly
it
would
have
been
of
no
use
the
dog
was
barking
what
did
he
say
that
he
had
been
out
for
medicine
that
his
wife
was
sick
do
you
know
a
pharmacist
named
alexander
jonathan
alexander
there
is
such
a
one
but
i
do
know
him
i
was
excused
and
reynolds
was
called
he
had
heard
no
quarreling
that
sunday
night
had
even
heard
ladley
laughing
this
was
about
nine
yes
they
had
fought
in
the
afternoon
he
had
not
overheard
any
words
but
their
voices
were
quarrelsome
and
once
he
heard
a
chair
or
some
article
of
furniture
overthrown
was
awakened
about
two
by
footsteps
on
the
stairs
followed
by
the
sound
of
oars
in
the
lower
hall
he
told
his
story
plainly
and
simply
under
admitted
that
he
was
fond
of
detective
stories
and
had
tried
to
write
one
himself
that
he
had
said
at
the
store
that
he
would
like
to
see
that
conceited
ass
swing
referring
to
the
prisoner
that
he
had
sent
flowers
to
jennie
brice
at
the
theater
and
had
made
a
few
advances
to
her
without
success
my
head
was
going
round
i
do
know
yet
how
the
police
learned
it
all
but
by
the
time
poor
reynolds
left
the
stand
half
the
people
there
believed
that
he
had
been
in
love
with
jennie
brice
that
she
had
spurned
his
advances
and
that
there
was
more
to
the
story
than
any
of
them
had
suspected
miss
hope
story
held
without
any
alteration
under
the
she
was
perfectly
at
ease
looked
handsome
and
well
dressed
and
could
not
be
shaken
she
told
how
jennie
brice
had
been
in
fear
of
her
life
and
had
asked
her
only
the
week
before
she
disappeared
to
allow
her
to
go
home
with
her
miss
hope
she
told
of
the
attack
of
hysteria
in
her
and
that
the
missing
woman
had
said
that
her
husband
would
kill
her
some
day
there
was
much
wrangling
over
her
testimony
and
i
believe
at
least
a
part
of
it
was
not
allowed
to
go
to
the
jury
but
i
am
not
a
lawyer
and
i
repeat
what
i
recall
did
she
say
that
he
had
attacked
her
yes
more
than
once
she
was
a
large
woman
fairly
muscular
and
had
always
held
her
own
did
she
say
that
these
attacks
came
when
he
had
been
drinking
i
believe
he
was
worse
then
did
she
give
any
reason
for
her
husband
attitude
to
her
she
said
he
wanted
to
marry
another
woman
there
was
a
small
sensation
at
this
if
proved
it
established
a
motive
did
she
know
who
the
other
woman
was
i
believe
not
she
was
away
most
of
the
day
and
he
put
in
his
time
as
he
liked
did
miss
brice
ever
mention
the
nature
of
the
threats
he
made
against
her
no
i
think
not
have
you
examined
the
body
washed
ashore
at
sewickley
yes
in
a
low
voice
is
it
the
body
of
jennie
brice
i
can
not
say
does
the
remaining
hand
look
like
the
hand
of
jennie
brice
very
much
the
nails
are
filed
to
points
as
she
wore
hers
did
you
ever
know
of
jennie
brice
having
a
scar
on
her
breast
no
but
that
would
be
easily
concealed
just
what
do
you
mean
many
actresses
conceal
defects
she
could
have
worn
plaster
and
covered
it
with
powder
also
such
a
scar
would
not
necessarily
be
seen
explain
that
most
of
jennie
brice
décolleté
gowns
were
cut
to
a
point
this
would
conceal
such
a
scar
miss
hope
was
excused
and
jennie
brice
sister
from
olean
was
called
she
was
a
smaller
woman
than
jennie
brice
had
been
very
in
her
manner
she
said
she
was
married
and
living
in
olean
she
had
not
seen
her
sister
for
several
years
but
had
heard
from
her
often
the
witness
had
discouraged
the
marriage
to
the
prisoner
why
she
had
had
bad
luck
before
she
had
been
married
before
yes
to
a
man
named
john
bellows
they
were
in
vaudeville
together
on
the
keith
circuit
they
were
known
as
the
pair
of
bellows
i
sat
up
at
this
for
john
bellows
had
boarded
at
my
house
bellows
is
dead
i
think
not
she
divorced
him
did
you
know
of
any
scar
on
your
sister
body
i
never
heard
of
one
have
you
seen
the
body
found
at
sewickley
yes
faintly
can
you
identify
it
no
sir
a
flurry
was
caused
during
the
afternoon
by
timothy
senft
he
testified
to
what
i
already
knew
that
between
three
and
four
on
monday
morning
during
the
height
of
the
flood
he
had
seen
from
his
a
small
skiff
caught
in
the
current
near
the
ninth
street
bridge
he
had
shouted
encouragingly
to
the
man
in
the
boat
running
out
a
way
on
the
ice
to
make
him
hear
he
had
told
him
to
row
with
the
current
and
to
try
to
steer
in
toward
shore
he
had
followed
close
to
the
river
bank
in
his
own
boat
below
sixth
street
the
other
boat
was
within
distance
he
had
pulled
it
in
and
had
towed
it
well
back
out
of
the
current
the
man
in
the
boat
was
the
prisoner
asked
if
the
prisoner
gave
any
explanation
yes
he
said
he
sleep
and
had
thought
to
tire
himself
rowing
had
been
caught
in
the
current
before
he
knew
it
saw
nothing
suspicious
in
or
about
the
boat
as
they
passed
the
police
patrol
boat
prisoner
had
called
to
ask
if
there
was
much
distress
and
expressed
regret
when
told
there
was
tim
was
excused
he
had
made
a
profound
impression
i
would
not
have
given
a
dollar
for
ladley
chance
with
the
jury
at
that
time
chapter
xiii
the
prosecution
produced
many
witnesses
during
the
next
two
days
tim
story
withstood
the
most
vigorous
after
him
bronson
from
the
theater
corroborated
miss
hope
story
of
jennie
brice
attack
of
hysteria
in
the
and
told
of
taking
her
home
that
night
he
was
a
poor
witness
nervous
and
halting
he
weighed
each
word
before
he
said
it
and
he
made
a
general
unfavorable
impression
i
thought
he
was
holding
something
back
in
view
of
what
pitman
would
have
called
the
denouement
his
attitude
is
easily
explained
but
i
was
puzzled
then
so
far
the
prosecution
had
touched
but
lightly
on
the
possible
motive
for
a
crime
the
woman
but
on
the
third
day
to
my
surprise
a
agnes
murray
was
called
it
was
the
murray
i
had
seen
at
the
morgue
i
have
lost
the
clipping
of
that
day
trial
but
i
remember
her
testimony
perfectly
she
was
a
widow
living
above
a
small
millinery
shop
on
federal
street
allegheny
she
had
one
daughter
alice
who
did
stenography
and
typing
as
a
means
of
livelihood
she
had
no
office
and
worked
at
home
many
of
the
small
stores
in
the
neighborhood
employed
her
to
send
out
their
bills
there
was
a
card
at
the
street
entrance
beside
the
shop
and
now
and
then
strangers
brought
her
work
early
in
december
the
prisoner
had
brought
her
the
manuscript
of
a
play
to
type
and
from
that
time
on
he
came
frequently
sometimes
every
day
bringing
a
few
sheets
of
manuscript
at
a
time
sometimes
he
came
without
any
manuscript
and
would
sit
and
talk
while
he
smoked
a
cigarette
they
had
thought
him
unmarried
on
wednesday
february
alice
murray
had
disappeared
she
had
taken
some
of
her
clothing
not
all
and
had
left
a
note
the
witness
read
the
note
aloud
in
a
trembling
voice
dear
mother
when
you
get
this
i
shall
be
married
to
ladley
do
worry
will
write
again
from
lovingly
alice
from
that
time
until
a
week
before
she
had
not
heard
from
her
daughter
then
she
had
a
card
mailed
from
madison
square
station
new
york
city
the
card
merely
said
am
well
and
working
alice
the
defense
was
visibly
shaken
they
had
not
expected
this
and
i
thought
even
ladley
whose
calm
had
continued
unbroken
paled
so
far
all
had
gone
well
for
the
prosecution
they
had
proved
a
crime
as
nearly
as
circumstantial
evidence
could
prove
a
crime
and
they
had
established
a
motive
but
in
the
identification
of
the
body
so
far
they
had
failed
the
prosecution
rested
as
they
say
although
they
did
rest
much
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
the
defense
called
first
of
all
eliza
shaeffer
she
told
of
a
woman
answering
the
general
description
of
jennie
brice
having
spent
two
days
at
the
shaeffer
farm
at
horner
being
shown
photographs
of
jennie
brice
she
said
she
thought
it
was
the
same
woman
but
was
not
certain
she
told
further
of
the
woman
leaving
unexpectedly
on
wednesday
of
that
week
from
thornville
on
being
shown
the
small
photograph
which
graves
had
shown
me
she
identified
the
woman
in
the
group
as
being
the
woman
in
question
as
the
face
was
in
shadow
knew
it
more
by
the
dress
and
hat
she
described
the
black
and
white
dress
and
the
hat
with
red
trimming
the
defense
then
called
me
i
had
to
admit
that
the
dress
and
hat
as
described
were
almost
certainly
the
ones
i
had
seen
on
the
bed
in
jennie
brice
room
the
day
before
she
disappeared
i
could
not
say
definitely
whether
the
woman
in
the
photograph
was
jennie
brice
or
not
under
a
thought
it
might
be
defense
called
jonathan
alexander
a
druggist
who
testified
that
on
the
night
in
question
he
had
been
roused
at
half
past
three
by
the
prisoner
who
had
said
his
wife
was
ill
and
had
purchased
a
bottle
of
a
proprietary
remedy
from
him
his
identification
was
absolute
the
defense
called
jennie
brice
sister
and
endeavored
to
prove
that
jennie
brice
had
had
no
such
scar
it
was
shown
that
she
was
on
intimate
terms
with
her
family
and
would
hardly
have
concealed
an
operation
of
any
gravity
from
them
the
defense
scored
that
day
they
had
shown
that
the
prisoner
had
told
the
truth
when
he
said
he
had
gone
to
a
pharmacy
for
medicine
that
night
for
his
wife
and
they
had
shown
that
a
woman
answering
the
description
of
jennie
brice
spent
two
days
in
a
town
called
horner
and
had
gone
from
there
on
wednesday
after
the
crime
and
they
had
shown
that
this
woman
was
attired
as
jennie
brice
had
been
that
was
the
way
things
stood
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
day
when
court
adjourned
reynolds
was
at
home
when
i
got
there
he
had
been
very
much
subdued
since
the
developments
of
that
first
day
of
the
trial
sat
mostly
in
his
own
room
and
had
twice
brought
me
a
bunch
of
jonquils
as
a
he
had
the
kettle
boiling
when
i
got
home
you
have
had
a
number
of
visitors
he
said
our
young
friend
howell
has
been
here
and
holcombe
has
arrived
and
has
a
man
in
his
room
holcombe
came
down
a
moment
after
with
his
face
beaming
i
think
we
got
him
pitman
he
said
the
jury
wo
even
go
out
of
the
box
but
further
than
that
he
would
not
explain
he
said
he
had
a
witness
locked
in
his
room
and
he
be
glad
of
supper
for
him
as
they
both
come
a
long
ways
and
he
went
out
and
bought
some
oysters
and
a
bottle
or
two
of
beer
but
as
far
as
i
know
he
kept
him
locked
up
all
that
night
in
the
front
room
i
do
think
the
man
knew
he
was
a
prisoner
i
went
in
to
turn
down
the
bed
and
he
was
sitting
by
the
window
reading
the
evening
paper
account
of
the
trial
an
elderly
gentleman
rather
holcombe
slept
on
the
upper
landing
of
the
hall
that
night
rolled
in
a
blanket
not
that
i
think
his
witness
even
thought
of
escaping
but
the
little
man
was
taking
no
chances
at
eight
that
night
the
bell
rang
it
was
howell
i
admitted
him
myself
and
he
followed
me
back
to
the
i
had
not
seen
him
for
several
weeks
and
the
change
in
him
startled
me
he
was
dressed
carefully
but
his
eyes
were
sunken
in
his
head
and
he
looked
as
if
he
had
not
slept
for
days
reynolds
had
gone
not
finding
me
socially
inclined
you
have
been
sick
howell
have
you
i
asked
oh
no
i
well
enough
i
been
traveling
about
those
infernal
his
voice
trailed
off
and
i
saw
him
looking
at
my
mother
picture
with
the
jonquils
beneath
that
curious
he
said
going
closer
it
it
looks
almost
like
lida
harvey
my
mother
i
said
simply
have
you
seen
her
lately
my
mother
i
asked
startled
no
lida
i
saw
her
a
few
days
ago
here
yes
she
came
here
howell
two
weeks
ago
she
looks
badly
as
if
she
is
worrying
not
about
me
he
asked
eagerly
yes
about
you
what
possessed
you
to
go
away
as
you
did
when
my
bro
when
her
uncle
accused
you
of
something
you
ran
away
instead
of
facing
things
like
a
man
i
was
trying
to
find
the
one
person
who
could
clear
me
mrs
pitman
he
sat
back
with
his
eyes
closed
he
looked
ill
enough
to
be
in
bed
and
you
succeeded
no
i
thought
perhaps
he
had
not
been
eating
and
i
offered
him
food
as
i
had
once
before
but
he
refused
it
with
the
ghost
of
his
boyish
smile
i
hungry
but
it
not
food
i
want
i
want
to
see
he
said
i
sat
down
across
from
him
and
tried
to
mend
a
but
i
could
not
sew
i
kept
seeing
those
two
young
things
each
sick
for
a
sight
of
the
other
and
from
wishing
they
could
have
a
minute
together
i
got
to
planning
it
for
them
perhaps
i
said
finally
if
you
want
it
very
much
very
much
and
if
you
will
sit
quiet
and
stop
tapping
your
fingers
together
until
you
drive
me
crazy
i
might
contrive
it
for
you
for
five
minutes
i
said
not
a
second
longer
he
came
right
over
and
put
his
arms
around
me
who
are
you
anyhow
he
said
you
who
turn
to
the
world
the
frozen
mask
of
a
union
street
landlady
who
are
a
gentlewoman
by
every
instinct
and
training
and
a
girl
at
heart
who
are
you
i
tell
you
what
i
am
i
said
i
a
romantic
old
fool
and
better
let
me
do
this
quickly
before
i
change
my
mind
he
freed
me
at
that
but
he
followed
to
the
telephone
and
stood
by
while
i
got
lida
he
was
in
a
perfect
frenzy
of
anxiety
turning
red
and
white
by
turns
and
in
the
middle
of
the
conversation
taking
the
receiver
bodily
from
me
and
holding
it
to
his
own
ear
she
said
she
thought
she
could
get
away
she
spoke
guardedly
as
if
alma
were
near
but
i
gathered
that
she
would
come
as
soon
as
she
could
and
from
the
way
her
voice
broke
i
knew
she
was
as
excited
as
the
boy
beside
me
she
came
heavily
coated
and
veiled
at
a
quarter
after
ten
that
night
and
i
took
her
back
to
the
where
he
was
waiting
he
did
not
make
a
move
toward
her
but
stood
there
with
his
very
lips
white
looking
at
her
and
at
first
she
did
not
make
a
move
either
but
stood
and
gazed
at
him
thin
and
white
a
wreck
of
himself
then
ell
she
cried
and
ran
around
the
table
to
him
as
he
held
out
his
arms
the
was
out
i
went
into
the
parlor
bedroom
and
sat
in
the
cozy
corner
in
the
dark
i
had
done
a
wrong
thing
and
i
was
glad
of
it
and
sitting
there
in
the
darkness
i
went
over
my
own
life
again
after
all
it
had
been
my
own
life
i
had
lived
it
no
one
else
had
shaped
it
for
me
and
if
it
was
cheerless
and
colorless
now
it
had
had
its
big
moments
life
is
measured
by
big
moments
if
i
let
the
two
children
in
the
have
fifteen
big
moments
instead
of
five
who
can
blame
me
chapter
xiv
the
next
day
was
the
sensational
one
of
the
trial
we
went
through
every
phase
of
conviction
jennie
brice
was
living
jennie
brice
was
dead
the
body
found
at
sewickley
could
not
be
jennie
brice
the
body
found
at
sewickley
jennie
brice
and
so
it
went
on
the
defense
did
an
unexpected
thing
in
putting
ladley
on
the
stand
that
day
for
the
first
time
he
showed
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
ordeal
he
had
no
flower
in
his
and
the
rims
of
his
eyes
were
red
but
he
was
quite
cool
his
stage
training
had
taught
him
not
only
to
endure
the
eyes
of
the
crowd
but
to
find
in
its
gaze
a
sort
of
stimulant
he
made
a
good
witness
i
must
admit
he
replied
to
the
usual
questions
easily
after
five
minutes
or
so
llewellyn
got
down
to
work
ladley
you
have
said
that
your
wife
was
ill
the
night
of
march
fourth
yes
what
was
the
nature
of
her
illness
she
had
a
functional
heart
trouble
not
serious
will
you
tell
us
fully
the
events
of
that
night
i
had
been
asleep
when
my
wife
wakened
me
she
asked
for
a
medicine
she
used
in
these
attacks
i
got
up
and
found
the
bottle
but
it
was
empty
as
she
was
nervous
and
frightened
i
agreed
to
try
to
get
some
at
a
drug
store
i
went
took
pitman
boat
and
went
to
several
stores
before
i
could
awaken
a
pharmacist
you
cut
the
boat
loose
yes
it
was
tied
in
a
woman
knot
or
series
of
knots
i
could
not
untie
it
and
i
was
in
a
hurry
how
did
you
cut
it
with
my
you
did
not
use
pitman
i
did
not
and
in
cutting
it
you
cut
your
wrist
did
you
yes
the
knife
slipped
i
have
the
scar
still
what
did
you
do
then
i
went
back
to
the
room
and
stanched
the
blood
with
a
towel
from
whom
did
you
get
the
medicine
from
alexander
pharmacy
at
what
time
i
am
not
certain
about
three
probably
you
went
directly
back
home
ladley
hesitated
no
he
said
finally
my
wife
had
had
these
attacks
but
they
were
not
serious
i
was
curious
to
see
how
the
looked
and
rowed
out
too
far
i
was
caught
in
the
current
and
nearly
carried
away
you
came
home
after
that
yes
at
once
ladley
was
better
and
had
dropped
asleep
she
wakened
as
i
came
in
she
was
disagreeable
about
the
length
of
time
i
had
been
gone
and
would
not
let
me
explain
we
quarreled
and
she
said
she
was
going
to
leave
me
i
said
that
as
she
had
threatened
this
before
and
had
never
done
it
i
would
see
that
she
really
started
at
daylight
i
rowed
her
to
federal
street
what
had
she
with
her
a
small
brown
valise
how
was
she
dressed
in
a
black
and
white
dress
and
hat
with
a
long
black
coat
what
was
the
last
you
saw
of
her
she
was
going
across
the
sixth
street
bridge
alone
no
she
went
with
a
young
man
we
knew
there
was
a
stir
in
the
court
room
at
this
who
was
the
young
man
a
howell
a
reporter
on
a
newspaper
here
have
you
seen
howell
since
your
arrest
no
sir
he
has
been
out
of
the
city
i
was
so
excited
by
this
time
that
i
could
hardly
hear
i
missed
some
of
the
the
district
attorney
pulled
testimony
to
pieces
you
cut
the
boat
painter
with
your
i
did
then
how
do
you
account
for
pitman
broken
knife
with
the
blade
in
your
room
i
have
no
theory
about
it
she
may
have
broken
it
herself
she
had
used
it
the
day
before
to
lift
tacks
out
of
a
carpet
that
was
true
i
had
that
early
monday
morning
was
cold
was
it
not
yes
very
why
did
your
wife
leave
without
her
fur
coat
i
did
not
know
she
had
until
we
had
left
the
house
then
i
did
not
ask
her
she
would
not
speak
to
me
i
see
but
is
it
not
true
that
upon
a
wet
fur
coat
being
shown
you
as
your
wife
you
said
it
could
not
be
hers
as
she
had
taken
hers
with
her
i
do
not
recall
such
a
statement
you
recall
a
coat
being
shown
you
yes
pitman
brought
a
coat
to
my
door
but
i
was
working
on
a
play
i
am
writing
and
i
do
not
remember
what
i
said
the
coat
was
ruined
i
did
not
want
it
i
probably
said
the
first
thing
i
thought
of
to
get
rid
of
the
woman
i
got
up
at
that
i
held
my
peace
about
the
but
this
was
too
much
however
the
moment
i
started
to
speak
somebody
pushed
me
back
into
my
chair
and
told
me
to
be
quiet
now
you
say
you
were
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
this
medicine
for
your
wife
that
you
cut
the
rope
thus
cutting
your
wrist
yes
i
have
the
scar
still
you
could
not
wait
to
untie
the
boat
and
yet
you
went
along
the
to
see
how
high
the
water
was
her
alarm
had
excited
me
but
when
i
got
out
and
remembered
that
the
doctors
had
told
us
she
would
never
die
in
an
attack
i
grew
more
composed
you
got
the
medicine
first
you
say
yes
alexander
has
testified
that
you
got
the
medicine
at
it
has
been
shown
that
you
left
the
house
at
two
and
got
back
about
four
does
not
this
show
that
with
all
your
alarm
you
went
to
the
first
i
was
gone
from
two
to
four
he
replied
calmly
alexander
must
be
wrong
about
the
time
i
wakened
him
i
got
the
medicine
first
when
your
wife
left
you
at
the
bridge
did
she
say
where
she
was
going
no
you
claim
that
this
woman
at
horner
was
your
wife
i
think
it
likely
was
there
an
onyx
clock
in
the
room
when
you
moved
into
it
i
do
not
recall
the
clock
your
wife
did
not
take
an
onyx
clock
away
with
her
ladley
smiled
no
the
defense
called
howell
next
he
looked
rested
and
the
happier
for
having
seen
lida
but
he
was
still
pale
and
showed
the
strain
of
some
hidden
anxiety
what
that
anxiety
was
the
next
two
days
were
to
tell
us
all
howell
llewellyn
asked
you
know
the
prisoner
slightly
state
when
you
met
him
on
sunday
morning
march
the
fourth
i
went
to
see
him
will
you
tell
us
the
nature
of
that
visit
my
paper
had
heard
he
was
writing
a
play
for
himself
i
was
to
get
an
interview
with
photographs
if
possible
you
saw
his
wife
at
that
time
yes
when
did
you
see
her
again
the
following
morning
at
six
or
a
little
later
i
walked
across
the
sixth
street
bridge
with
her
and
put
her
on
a
train
for
horner
pennsylvania
you
are
positive
it
was
jennie
brice
yes
i
watched
her
get
out
of
the
boat
while
her
husband
steadied
it
if
you
knew
this
why
did
you
not
come
forward
sooner
i
have
been
out
of
the
city
but
you
knew
the
prisoner
had
been
arrested
and
that
this
testimony
of
yours
would
be
invaluable
to
him
yes
but
i
thought
it
necessary
to
produce
jennie
brice
herself
my
unsupported
word
you
have
been
searching
for
jennie
brice
yes
since
march
the
eighth
how
was
she
dressed
when
you
saw
her
last
she
wore
a
red
and
black
hat
and
a
black
coat
she
carried
a
small
brown
valise
thank
you
the
did
not
shake
his
testimony
but
it
brought
out
some
curious
things
howell
refused
to
say
how
he
happened
to
be
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
street
bridge
at
that
hour
or
why
he
had
thought
it
necessary
on
meeting
a
woman
he
claimed
to
have
known
only
hours
to
go
with
her
to
the
railway
station
and
put
her
on
a
train
the
jury
was
visibly
impressed
and
much
shaken
for
howell
carried
conviction
in
every
word
he
said
he
looked
the
district
attorney
in
the
eye
and
once
when
our
glances
crossed
he
even
smiled
at
me
faintly
but
i
saw
why
he
had
tried
to
find
jennie
brice
and
had
dreaded
testifying
not
a
woman
in
that
court
room
and
hardly
a
man
but
believed
when
he
left
the
stand
that
he
was
or
had
been
jennie
brice
lover
and
as
such
was
assisting
her
to
leave
her
husband
then
you
believe
the
district
attorney
said
at
the
end
you
believe
howell
that
jennie
brice
is
living
jennie
brice
was
living
on
monday
morning
march
the
fifth
he
said
firmly
miss
shaeffer
has
testified
that
on
wednesday
this
woman
who
you
claim
was
jennie
brice
sent
a
letter
to
you
from
horner
is
that
the
case
yes
the
letter
was
signed
brice
it
was
signed
will
you
show
the
court
that
letter
i
destroyed
it
it
was
a
personal
letter
it
merely
said
she
had
arrived
safely
and
not
to
let
any
one
know
where
she
was
and
yet
you
destroyed
it
a
postscript
said
to
do
so
why
i
do
not
know
an
extra
precaution
probably
you
were
under
the
impression
that
she
was
going
to
stay
there
she
was
to
have
remained
for
a
week
and
you
have
been
searching
for
this
woman
for
two
months
he
quailed
but
his
voice
was
steady
yes
he
admitted
he
was
telling
the
truth
even
if
it
was
not
all
the
truth
i
believe
had
it
gone
to
the
jury
then
ladley
would
have
been
acquitted
but
late
that
afternoon
things
took
a
new
turn
counsel
for
the
prosecution
stated
to
the
court
that
he
had
a
new
and
important
witness
and
got
permission
to
introduce
this
further
evidence
the
witness
was
a
doctor
littlefield
and
proved
to
be
my
tenant
of
the
front
holcombe
prisoner
of
the
night
before
took
the
stand
the
doctor
was
less
impressive
in
full
daylight
he
was
a
trifle
shiny
a
bit
bulbous
as
to
nose
and
indifferent
as
to
but
his
testimony
was
given
with
due
professional
weight
you
are
a
doctor
of
medicine
doctor
littlefield
asked
the
district
attorney
yes
in
active
practise
i
have
a
cure
for
inebriates
in
des
moines
iowa
i
was
formerly
in
general
practise
in
new
york
city
you
knew
jennie
ladley
i
had
seen
her
at
different
theaters
and
she
consulted
me
professionally
at
one
time
in
new
york
you
operated
on
her
i
believe
yes
she
came
to
me
to
have
a
name
removed
it
had
been
tattooed
over
her
heart
you
removed
it
not
at
once
i
tried
fading
the
marks
with
goat
milk
but
she
was
impatient
on
the
third
visit
to
my
office
she
demanded
that
the
name
be
cut
out
you
did
it
yes
she
refused
a
general
anesthetic
and
i
used
cocaine
the
name
was
john
i
believe
a
former
husband
she
intended
to
marry
again
a
titter
ran
over
the
court
room
people
strained
to
the
utmost
are
always
glad
of
an
excuse
to
smile
the
laughter
of
a
crowd
always
seems
to
me
half
hysterical
have
you
seen
photographs
of
the
scar
on
the
body
found
at
sewickley
or
the
body
itself
no
i
have
not
will
you
describe
the
operation
i
made
a
transverse
incision
for
the
body
of
the
name
and
two
vertical
ones
one
longer
for
the
the
other
shorter
for
the
stem
of
the
there
was
a
dot
after
the
name
i
made
a
incision
for
it
will
you
sketch
the
cicatrix
as
you
recall
it
the
doctor
made
a
careful
drawing
on
a
pad
that
was
passed
to
him
the
drawing
was
much
like
this
line
for
line
dot
for
dot
it
was
the
scar
on
the
body
found
at
sewickley
you
are
sure
the
woman
was
jennie
brice
she
sent
me
tickets
for
the
theater
shortly
after
and
i
had
an
announcement
of
her
marriage
to
the
prisoner
some
weeks
later
were
there
any
witnesses
to
the
operation
my
assistant
i
can
produce
him
at
any
time
that
was
not
all
of
the
trial
but
it
was
the
decisive
moment
shortly
after
the
jury
withdrew
and
for
hours
not
a
word
was
heard
from
them
chapter
xv
after
hours
deliberation
the
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
it
was
a
verdict
howell
unsupported
word
had
lost
out
against
a
scar
contrary
to
my
expectation
holcombe
was
not
jubilant
over
the
verdict
he
came
into
the
that
night
and
stood
by
the
window
looking
out
into
the
yard
it
is
logical
he
said
in
view
of
howell
testimony
ridiculous
heaven
help
us
under
this
jury
system
anyhow
look
at
the
facts
howell
knows
the
woman
he
sees
her
on
monday
morning
and
puts
her
on
a
train
out
of
town
the
boy
is
telling
the
truth
he
has
nothing
to
gain
by
coming
forward
and
everything
to
lose
very
well
she
was
alive
on
monday
we
know
where
she
was
on
tuesday
and
wednesday
anyhow
during
those
days
her
gem
of
a
husband
was
in
jail
he
was
freed
thursday
night
and
from
that
time
until
his
rearrest
on
the
following
tuesday
i
had
him
under
observation
every
moment
he
left
the
jail
thursday
night
and
on
saturday
the
body
floated
in
at
sewickley
if
it
was
done
by
ladley
it
must
have
been
done
on
friday
and
on
friday
he
was
in
view
through
the
periscope
all
day
reynolds
came
in
and
joined
us
there
only
one
way
out
that
i
see
he
said
mildly
two
women
have
been
fool
enough
to
have
a
name
tattooed
over
their
hearts
no
woman
ever
thought
enough
of
me
to
have
name
put
on
her
i
hope
not
i
retorted
reynold
first
name
is
zachariah
but
as
holcombe
said
all
that
had
been
proved
was
that
jennie
brice
was
dead
probably
murdered
he
could
not
understand
the
defense
letting
the
case
go
to
the
jury
without
their
putting
more
stress
on
howell
story
but
we
were
to
understand
that
soon
and
many
other
things
holcombe
told
me
that
evening
of
learning
from
john
bellows
of
the
tattooed
name
on
jennie
brice
and
of
how
after
an
almost
endless
search
he
had
found
the
man
who
had
cut
the
name
away
at
eight
the
rang
reynolds
had
gone
to
lodge
he
being
an
elk
and
several
other
things
and
much
given
to
regalia
in
boxes
and
having
his
picture
in
the
newspapers
in
different
outlandish
costumes
pitman
used
to
say
that
man
being
denied
his
natural
love
for
barbaric
adornment
in
his
clothing
took
to
the
different
fraternities
as
an
excuse
for
decking
himself
out
but
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
it
was
old
isaac
he
had
a
basket
in
his
hand
and
he
stepped
into
the
hall
and
placed
it
on
the
floor
evening
miss
bess
he
said
can
you
see
a
bit
of
company
i
can
always
see
you
i
replied
but
he
had
not
meant
himself
he
stepped
to
the
door
and
opening
it
beckoned
to
some
one
across
the
street
it
was
lida
she
came
in
her
color
a
little
heightened
and
old
isaac
stood
back
beaming
at
us
both
i
believe
it
was
one
of
the
crowning
moments
of
the
old
man
life
thus
to
see
his
miss
bess
and
alma
child
together
is
is
he
here
yet
she
asked
me
nervously
i
did
not
know
he
was
coming
there
was
no
need
to
ask
which
he
there
was
only
one
for
lida
he
telephoned
me
and
asked
me
to
come
here
oh
pitman
so
afraid
for
him
she
had
quite
forgotten
isaac
i
turned
to
the
room
and
opened
the
door
the
woman
who
belongs
here
is
out
at
a
lecture
i
said
come
in
here
ikkie
and
i
find
the
evening
paper
for
you
said
lida
and
stood
staring
at
me
i
think
i
went
white
the
lady
heah
and
i
is
old
friends
isaac
said
with
his
splendid
manner
her
mothah
miss
lida
her
mothah
but
even
old
isaac
choked
up
at
that
and
i
closed
the
door
on
him
how
queer
lida
said
looking
at
me
so
isaac
knew
your
mother
have
you
lived
always
in
allegheny
mrs
pitman
i
was
born
in
pittsburgh
i
evaded
i
went
away
for
a
long
time
but
i
always
longed
for
the
hurry
and
activity
of
the
old
home
town
so
here
i
am
again
fortunately
like
all
the
young
her
own
affairs
engrossed
her
she
was
flushed
with
the
prospect
of
meeting
her
lover
tremulous
over
what
the
evening
might
bring
the
woman
who
had
come
back
to
the
hurry
of
the
old
town
and
who
pushed
back
into
an
eddy
of
the
flood
district
could
only
watch
the
activity
and
the
life
from
behind
a
rooms
to
let
sign
did
not
concern
her
much
nor
should
she
have
howell
came
soon
after
he
asked
for
her
and
going
back
to
the
kissed
her
quietly
he
had
an
air
of
resolve
a
sort
of
grim
determination
that
was
a
relief
from
the
look
he
had
worn
before
he
asked
to
have
holcombe
brought
down
and
so
behold
us
all
four
of
us
sitting
around
the
table
holcombe
with
his
i
with
my
mending
and
the
boy
with
one
of
lida
hands
frankly
under
his
on
the
red
i
want
to
tell
all
of
you
the
whole
story
he
began
i
shall
go
to
the
district
attorney
and
confess
but
i
want
you
all
to
have
it
first
i
ca
sleep
again
until
i
get
it
off
my
chest
pitman
has
suffered
through
me
and
holcombe
here
has
spent
money
and
time
lida
did
not
speak
but
she
drew
her
chair
closer
and
put
her
other
hand
over
his
i
want
to
get
it
straight
if
i
can
let
me
see
it
was
on
sunday
the
fourth
that
the
river
came
up
was
it
yes
well
on
the
thursday
before
that
i
met
you
holcombe
in
a
restaurant
in
pittsburgh
do
you
remember
holcombe
nodded
we
were
talking
of
crime
and
i
said
no
man
should
be
hanged
on
purely
circumstantial
evidence
you
affirmed
that
a
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
could
properly
hang
a
man
we
had
a
long
argument
in
which
i
was
worsted
there
was
a
third
man
at
the
table
bronson
the
business
manager
of
the
liberty
theater
who
sided
with
you
put
in
holcombe
and
whose
views
i
refused
to
entertain
because
as
publicity
man
for
a
theater
he
dealt
in
fiction
rather
than
in
fact
precisely
you
may
recall
holcombe
that
you
offered
to
hang
any
man
we
would
name
given
a
proper
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
against
him
yes
after
you
left
bronson
spoke
to
me
he
said
business
at
the
theater
was
bad
and
complained
of
the
way
the
papers
used
or
would
not
use
his
stuff
he
said
the
liberty
theater
had
not
had
a
proper
deal
and
that
he
was
tempted
to
go
over
and
bang
one
of
the
company
on
the
head
and
so
get
a
little
free
advertising
i
said
he
ought
to
be
able
to
fake
a
good
story
but
he
maintained
that
a
newspaper
could
smell
a
faked
story
a
mile
away
and
that
anyhow
all
the
good
stunts
had
been
pulled
off
i
agreed
with
him
i
remember
saying
that
nothing
but
a
railroad
wreck
or
a
murder
hit
the
public
very
hard
these
days
and
that
i
did
feel
like
wrecking
the
pennsylvania
limited
he
leaned
over
the
table
and
looked
at
me
how
about
a
murder
then
he
said
get
the
story
for
your
paper
and
i
get
some
advertising
for
the
theater
we
need
it
that
sure
i
laughed
it
off
and
we
separated
but
at
two
bronson
called
me
up
again
i
met
him
in
his
office
at
the
theater
and
he
told
me
that
jennie
brice
who
was
out
of
the
cast
that
week
had
asked
for
a
week
vacation
she
had
heard
of
a
farm
at
a
town
called
horner
and
she
wanted
to
go
there
to
rest
the
idea
is
this
he
said
living
with
her
husband
and
he
has
threatened
her
life
more
than
once
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
frame
up
something
to
look
as
if
he
made
away
with
her
we
get
a
week
of
excitement
more
advertising
than
we
ordinarily
get
in
a
year
you
get
a
corking
news
story
and
find
jennie
brice
at
the
end
getting
the
credit
for
that
jennie
gets
a
hundred
dollars
and
a
rest
and
ladley
her
husband
gets
say
two
hundred
bronson
offered
to
put
up
the
money
and
i
agreed
the
flood
came
just
then
and
was
considerable
help
it
made
a
good
setting
i
went
to
my
city
editor
and
got
an
assignment
to
interview
ladley
about
this
play
of
his
then
bronson
and
i
went
together
to
see
the
ladleys
on
sunday
morning
and
as
they
needed
money
they
agreed
but
ladley
insisted
on
fifty
dollars
a
week
extra
if
he
had
to
go
to
jail
we
promised
it
but
we
did
not
intend
to
let
things
go
so
far
as
that
in
the
ladleys
room
that
sunday
morning
we
worked
it
all
out
the
hardest
thing
was
to
get
jennie
brice
consent
but
she
agreed
finally
we
arranged
a
list
of
clues
to
be
left
around
and
ladley
was
to
go
out
in
the
night
and
to
be
heard
coming
back
i
told
him
to
quarrel
with
his
wife
that
afternoon
although
i
do
believe
they
needed
to
be
asked
to
do
it
and
i
suggested
also
the
shoe
or
slipper
to
be
found
floating
around
just
a
moment
said
holcombe
busy
with
his
did
you
suggest
the
onyx
clock
no
no
clock
was
mentioned
the
the
clock
has
puzzled
me
the
towel
yes
i
said
no
murder
was
complete
without
blood
but
he
kicked
on
that
said
he
did
mind
the
rest
but
he
be
hanged
if
he
was
going
to
slash
himself
but
as
it
happened
he
cut
his
wrist
while
cutting
the
boat
loose
and
so
we
had
the
towel
asked
holcombe
well
no
there
was
nothing
said
about
a
did
he
say
he
burned
it
accidentally
so
he
claimed
holcombe
made
another
entry
in
his
book
then
i
said
every
murder
had
a
weapon
he
was
to
have
a
pistol
at
first
but
none
of
us
owned
one
ladley
undertook
to
get
a
knife
from
pitman
kitchen
and
to
leave
it
around
not
in
full
view
but
where
it
could
be
found
a
broken
knife
no
just
a
knife
he
was
to
throw
the
knife
into
the
water
that
was
not
arranged
i
only
gave
him
a
general
outline
he
was
to
add
any
interesting
details
that
might
occur
to
him
the
idea
of
course
was
to
give
the
police
plenty
to
work
on
and
just
when
they
thought
they
had
it
all
and
when
the
theater
had
had
a
lot
of
booming
and
i
had
got
a
good
story
to
produce
jennie
brice
safe
and
well
we
were
not
to
appear
in
it
at
all
it
would
have
worked
perfectly
but
we
forgot
to
count
on
one
thing
jennie
brice
hated
her
husband
not
really
hated
him
cried
lida
him
she
is
letting
him
hang
she
could
save
him
by
coming
forward
now
and
she
wo
do
it
she
is
hiding
so
he
will
go
to
the
gallows
there
was
a
pause
at
that
it
seemed
too
incredible
too
inhuman
then
early
that
monday
morning
you
smuggled
jennie
brice
out
of
the
city
yes
that
was
the
only
thing
we
bungled
we
fixed
the
hour
a
little
too
late
and
i
was
seen
by
miss
harvey
uncle
walking
across
the
bridge
with
a
woman
why
did
you
meet
her
openly
and
take
her
to
the
train
howell
bent
forward
and
smiled
across
at
the
little
man
one
of
your
own
axioms
sir
he
said
do
the
natural
thing
upset
the
customary
order
of
events
as
little
as
possible
jennie
brice
went
to
the
train
because
that
was
where
she
wanted
to
go
but
as
ladley
was
to
protest
that
his
wife
had
left
town
and
as
the
police
would
be
searching
for
a
solitary
woman
i
went
with
her
we
went
in
a
leisurely
manner
i
bought
her
a
magazine
and
a
morning
paper
asked
the
conductor
to
fix
her
window
and
in
general
acted
the
devoted
husband
seeing
his
wife
off
on
a
trip
i
even
he
smiled
i
even
promised
to
feed
the
canary
lida
took
her
hands
away
did
you
kiss
her
she
demanded
not
even
a
chaste
salute
he
said
his
spirits
were
rising
it
was
as
often
happens
as
if
the
mere
confession
removed
the
guilt
i
have
seen
little
boys
who
have
broken
a
window
show
the
same
relief
after
telling
about
it
for
a
day
or
two
bronson
and
i
sat
back
enjoying
the
things
turned
out
as
we
had
expected
business
boomed
at
the
theater
i
got
a
good
story
and
some
few
kind
words
from
my
city
editor
then
the
explosion
came
i
got
a
letter
from
jennie
brice
saying
she
was
going
away
and
that
we
need
not
try
to
find
her
i
went
to
horner
but
i
had
lost
track
of
her
completely
even
then
we
did
not
believe
things
so
bad
as
they
turned
out
to
be
we
thought
she
was
giving
us
a
bad
time
but
that
she
would
show
up
ladley
was
in
a
blue
funk
for
a
time
bronson
and
i
went
to
him
we
told
him
how
the
thing
had
slipped
up
we
did
want
to
go
to
the
police
and
confess
if
we
could
help
it
finally
he
agreed
to
stick
it
out
until
she
was
found
at
a
hundred
dollars
a
week
it
took
all
we
could
beg
borrow
and
steal
but
now
we
have
to
come
out
with
the
story
anyhow
holcombe
sat
up
and
closed
his
with
a
snap
i
not
so
sure
of
that
he
said
impressively
i
wonder
if
you
realize
young
man
that
having
provided
a
perfect
defense
for
this
man
ladley
you
provided
him
with
every
possible
inducement
to
make
away
with
his
wife
secure
in
your
coming
forward
at
the
last
minute
and
confessing
the
hoax
to
save
him
was
there
anything
he
might
not
have
dared
with
impunity
but
i
tell
you
i
took
jennie
brice
out
of
town
on
monday
morning
asked
holcombe
sternly
but
at
that
the
having
come
home
and
found
old
isaac
sound
asleep
in
her
cozy
corner
set
up
such
a
screaming
for
the
police
that
our
meeting
broke
up
nor
would
holcombe
explain
any
further
chapter
xvi
holcombe
was
up
very
early
the
next
morning
i
heard
him
moving
around
at
five
and
at
six
he
banged
at
my
door
and
demanded
to
know
at
what
time
the
neighborhood
rose
he
had
been
up
for
an
hour
and
there
were
no
signs
of
life
he
was
more
cheerful
after
he
had
had
a
cup
of
coffee
commented
on
lida
beauty
and
said
that
howell
was
a
lucky
chap
that
is
what
worries
me
holcombe
i
said
i
am
helping
the
affair
along
and
what
if
it
turns
out
badly
he
looked
at
me
over
his
glasses
it
is
likely
to
turn
out
badly
he
said
i
have
never
married
pitman
and
i
have
missed
a
great
deal
out
of
life
perhaps
you
better
off
if
you
had
married
and
lost
your
wife
i
was
thinking
of
pitman
not
at
all
he
said
with
emphasis
it
better
to
have
married
and
lost
than
never
to
have
married
at
all
every
man
needs
a
good
woman
and
it
does
matter
how
old
he
is
the
older
he
is
the
more
he
needs
her
i
am
nearly
sixty
i
was
rather
startled
and
i
almost
dropped
the
fried
potatoes
but
the
next
moment
he
had
got
out
his
and
was
going
over
the
items
again
he
said
knife
onyx
clock
would
think
so
much
of
the
clock
if
he
had
been
so
damnably
anxious
to
hide
the
key
the
discrepancy
in
time
as
revealed
by
the
trial
yes
it
is
as
clear
as
a
bell
pitman
does
that
maguire
woman
next
door
sleep
all
day
she
up
now
i
said
looking
out
the
window
he
was
in
the
hall
in
a
moment
only
to
come
to
the
door
later
hat
in
hand
is
she
the
only
other
woman
on
the
street
who
keeps
boarders
she
the
only
woman
who
does
i
snapped
she
keep
anything
that
does
belong
to
her
except
boarders
ah
he
lighted
his
pipe
and
stood
puffing
at
it
and
watching
me
he
made
me
uneasy
i
thought
he
was
going
to
continue
the
subject
of
every
man
needing
a
wife
and
i
afraid
i
had
already
decided
to
take
him
if
he
offered
and
to
put
the
out
and
have
a
real
parlor
again
but
to
keep
reynolds
he
being
tidy
and
no
bother
but
when
he
spoke
he
was
back
to
the
crime
again
did
you
ever
work
a
typewriter
he
asked
what
with
the
surprise
i
was
a
little
sharp
i
do
play
any
instrument
except
an
i
replied
shortly
and
went
on
clearing
the
table
i
wonder
do
you
remember
about
the
village
idiot
and
the
horse
but
of
course
you
do
pitman
you
are
a
woman
of
imagination
you
think
you
could
be
alice
murray
for
a
few
moments
now
think
you
are
a
stenographer
with
theatrical
ambitions
you
meet
an
actor
and
you
fall
in
love
with
him
and
he
with
you
that
hard
to
imagine
that
last
not
so
hard
he
said
gently
now
the
actor
is
going
to
put
you
on
the
stage
perhaps
in
this
new
play
and
some
day
he
is
going
to
marry
you
is
that
what
he
promised
the
girl
according
to
some
letters
her
mother
found
yes
the
actor
is
married
but
he
tells
you
he
will
divorce
the
wife
you
are
to
wait
for
him
and
in
the
meantime
he
wants
you
near
him
away
from
the
office
where
other
men
are
apt
to
come
in
with
letters
to
be
typed
and
to
chaff
you
you
are
a
pretty
girl
it
is
necessary
to
overwork
my
imagination
i
said
with
a
little
bitterness
i
had
been
a
pretty
girl
but
work
and
worry
now
you
are
going
to
new
york
very
soon
and
in
the
meantime
you
have
cut
yourself
off
from
all
your
people
you
have
no
one
but
this
man
what
would
you
do
where
would
you
go
how
old
was
the
girl
nineteen
i
think
i
said
slowly
that
if
i
were
nineteen
and
in
love
with
a
man
and
hiding
i
would
hide
as
near
him
as
possible
i
be
likely
to
get
a
window
that
could
see
his
going
out
and
coming
in
a
place
so
near
that
he
could
come
often
to
see
me
bravo
he
exclaimed
of
course
with
your
present
wisdom
and
experience
you
would
do
nothing
so
foolish
but
this
girl
was
in
her
teens
she
was
not
very
far
away
for
he
probably
saw
her
that
sunday
afternoon
when
he
was
out
for
two
hours
and
as
the
going
was
slow
that
day
and
he
had
much
to
tell
and
explain
i
figure
she
was
not
far
off
probably
in
this
very
neighborhood
during
the
remainder
of
that
morning
i
saw
holcombe
at
intervals
going
from
house
to
house
along
union
street
making
short
excursions
into
side
thoroughfares
coming
back
again
and
taking
up
his
ringing
with
unflagging
energy
i
watched
him
off
and
on
for
two
hours
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
came
back
flushed
and
excited
i
found
the
house
he
said
wiping
his
glasses
she
was
there
all
right
not
so
close
as
we
had
thought
but
as
close
as
she
could
get
and
can
you
trace
her
i
asked
his
face
changed
and
saddened
poor
child
he
said
she
is
dead
mrs
pitman
not
she
at
sewickley
no
he
said
patiently
that
was
jennie
brice
but
howell
howell
is
a
young
ass
he
said
with
irritation
he
did
not
take
jennie
brice
out
of
the
city
that
morning
he
took
alice
murray
in
jennie
brice
clothing
and
veiled
well
that
is
five
years
ago
five
times
since
then
the
allegheny
river
from
being
a
mild
and
inoffensive
stream
carrying
a
few
boats
and
a
great
deal
of
sewage
has
become
a
raging
destroyer
and
has
filled
our
hearts
with
fear
and
our
cellars
with
mud
five
times
since
then
molly
maguire
has
appropriated
all
that
the
flood
carried
from
my
premises
to
hers
and
five
times
have
i
lifted
my
carpets
and
moved
holcombe
who
occupies
the
parlor
bedroom
to
a
room
a
few
days
ago
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
we
found
peter
body
floating
in
the
cellar
and
as
soon
as
the
yard
was
dry
i
buried
him
he
had
grown
fat
and
lazy
but
i
shall
miss
him
yesterday
a
riverman
fell
off
a
barge
along
the
and
was
drowned
they
dragged
the
river
for
his
body
but
they
did
not
find
him
but
they
found
something
an
onyx
clock
with
the
tattered
remnant
of
a
muslin
wrapped
around
it
it
only
bore
out
the
story
as
we
had
known
it
for
five
years
the
murray
girl
had
lived
long
enough
to
make
a
statement
to
the
police
although
holcombe
only
learned
this
later
on
the
statement
being
shown
to
ladley
in
the
jail
and
his
learning
of
the
girl
death
he
collapsed
he
confessed
before
he
was
hanged
and
his
confession
briefly
was
like
this
he
had
met
the
murray
girl
in
connection
with
the
typing
of
his
play
and
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
he
had
never
cared
for
his
wife
and
would
have
been
glad
to
get
rid
of
her
in
any
way
possible
he
had
not
intended
to
kill
her
however
he
had
planned
to
elope
with
the
murray
girl
and
awaiting
an
opportunity
had
persuaded
her
to
leave
home
and
to
take
a
room
near
my
house
here
he
had
visited
her
daily
while
his
wife
was
at
the
theater
they
had
planned
to
go
to
new
york
together
on
monday
march
the
fifth
on
sunday
the
fourth
however
bronson
and
howell
had
made
their
curious
proposition
when
he
accepted
philip
ladley
maintained
that
he
meant
only
to
carry
out
the
plan
as
suggested
but
the
temptation
was
too
strong
for
him
that
night
while
his
wife
slept
he
had
strangled
her
i
believe
he
was
frantic
with
fear
after
he
had
done
it
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
made
the
body
unrecognizable
he
would
be
safe
enough
on
that
quiet
sunday
night
when
reynolds
reported
all
peaceful
in
the
ladley
room
he
had
cut
off
the
poor
wretch
head
and
had
tied
it
up
in
a
weighted
with
my
onyx
clock
it
is
a
curious
fact
about
the
case
that
the
scar
which
his
wife
incurred
to
enable
her
to
marry
him
was
the
means
of
his
undoing
he
insisted
and
i
believe
he
was
telling
the
truth
that
he
did
not
know
of
the
scar
that
is
his
wife
had
never
told
him
of
it
and
had
been
able
to
conceal
it
he
thought
she
had
probably
used
paraffin
in
some
way
in
his
final
statement
written
with
great
care
and
no
little
literary
finish
he
told
the
story
in
detail
of
arranging
the
clues
as
howell
and
bronson
had
suggested
of
going
out
in
the
boat
with
the
body
covered
with
a
fur
coat
in
the
bottom
of
the
skiff
of
throwing
it
into
the
current
above
the
ninth
street
bridge
and
of
seeing
the
fur
coat
fall
from
the
boat
and
carried
beyond
his
reach
of
disposing
of
the
head
near
the
seventh
street
bridge
of
going
to
a
drug
store
as
per
the
howell
instructions
and
of
coming
home
at
four
to
find
me
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
illustration
while
his
wife
slept
several
points
of
confusion
remained
one
had
been
caused
by
temple
hope
refusal
to
admit
that
the
dress
and
hat
that
figured
in
the
case
were
to
be
used
by
her
the
next
week
at
the
theater
ladley
insisted
that
this
was
the
case
and
that
on
that
sunday
afternoon
his
wife
had
requested
him
to
take
them
to
miss
hope
that
they
had
quarreled
as
to
whether
they
should
be
packed
in
a
box
or
in
the
brown
valise
and
that
he
had
visited
alice
murray
instead
it
was
on
the
way
there
that
the
idea
of
finally
getting
rid
of
jennie
brice
came
to
him
and
a
way
using
the
black
and
white
striped
dress
of
the
dispute
another
point
of
confusion
had
been
the
dismantling
of
his
room
that
monday
night
some
time
between
the
visit
of
temple
hope
and
the
return
of
holcombe
this
was
to
obtain
the
scrap
of
paper
containing
the
list
of
clues
as
suggested
by
howell
a
clue
that
might
have
brought
about
a
premature
discovery
of
the
hoax
to
the
girl
he
had
told
nothing
of
his
plan
but
he
had
told
her
she
was
to
leave
town
on
an
early
train
the
next
morning
going
as
his
wife
that
he
wished
her
to
wear
the
black
and
white
dress
and
hat
for
reasons
that
he
would
explain
later
and
to
be
veiled
heavily
that
to
the
young
man
who
would
put
her
on
the
train
and
who
had
seen
jennie
brice
only
once
she
was
to
be
jennie
brice
to
say
as
little
as
possible
and
not
to
raise
her
veil
her
further
instructions
were
simple
to
go
to
the
place
at
horner
where
jennie
brice
had
planned
to
go
but
to
use
the
name
of
bellows
there
and
after
she
had
been
there
for
a
day
or
two
to
go
as
quietly
as
possible
to
new
york
he
gave
her
the
address
of
a
where
he
could
write
her
and
where
he
would
join
her
later
he
reasoned
in
this
way
that
as
alice
murray
was
to
impersonate
jennie
brice
and
jennie
brice
hiding
from
her
husband
she
would
naturally
discard
her
name
the
name
bellows
had
been
hers
by
a
previous
marriage
and
she
might
easily
resume
it
thus
to
establish
his
innocence
he
had
not
only
the
evidence
of
howell
and
bronson
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
gigantic
hoax
he
had
the
evidence
of
howell
that
he
had
started
jennie
brice
to
horner
that
monday
morning
that
she
had
reached
horner
had
there
assumed
an
incognito
as
pitman
would
say
and
had
later
disappeared
from
there
maliciously
concealing
herself
to
work
his
undoing
in
all
probability
he
would
have
gone
free
seeing
no
one
in
the
church
in
all
that
throng
but
the
boy
who
waited
at
the
end
of
the
long
church
aisle
i
wanted
to
run
out
and
claim
her
my
own
blood
my
more
than
child
i
sat
down
and
covered
my
face
and
from
the
pew
behind
me
some
one
leaned
over
and
patted
my
shoulder
miss
bess
old
isaac
said
gently
do
take
on
miss
bess
he
came
the
next
day
and
brought
me
some
lilies
from
the
bouquet
that
she
had
sent
me
and
a
bottle
of
champagne
from
the
wedding
supper
i
had
not
tasted
champagne
for
twenty
years
that
is
all
of
the
story
on
summer
afternoons
sometimes
when
the
house
is
hot
i
go
to
the
park
and
sit
i
used
to
take
peter
but
now
he
is
dead
i
like
to
see
lida
little
boy
the
nurse
knows
me
by
sight
and
lets
me
talk
to
the
child
he
can
say
peter
quite
plainly
but
he
does
not
call
alma
grandmother
the
nurse
says
she
does
not
like
it
he
calls
her
nana
lida
does
not
forget
me
especially
at
apologies
the
chiffon
gown
her
mother
had
worn
at
her
wedding
alma
had
never
worn
it
but
once
and
now
she
was
too
stout
for
it
i
took
it
i
am
not
proud
and
i
should
like
molly
maguire
to
see
it
holcombe
asked
me
last
night
to
marry
him
he
says
he
needs
me
and
that
i
need
him
i
am
a
lonely
woman
and
getting
old
and
i
tired
of
watching
the
gas
meter
and
besides
with
peter
dead
i
need
a
man
in
the
house
all
the
time
the
flood
district
is
none
too
orderly
besides
when
i
have
a
wedding
dress
laid
away
and
a
bottle
of
good
wine
it
seems
a
pity
not
to
