christmas
eve
on
lonesome
it
was
christmas
eve
on
lonesome
but
nobody
on
lonesome
knew
that
it
was
christmas
eve
although
a
child
of
the
outer
world
could
have
guessed
it
even
out
in
those
wilds
where
lonesome
slipped
from
one
lone
log
cabin
high
up
the
steeps
down
through
a
stretch
of
jungled
darkness
to
another
lone
cabin
at
the
mouth
of
the
stream
there
was
the
holy
hush
in
the
gray
twilight
that
comes
only
on
christmas
eve
there
were
the
big
flakes
of
snow
that
fell
as
they
never
fall
except
on
christmas
eve
there
was
a
snowy
man
on
horseback
in
a
big
coat
and
with
that
might
have
been
bursting
with
toys
for
children
in
the
little
cabin
at
the
head
of
the
stream
but
not
even
he
knew
that
it
was
christmas
eve
he
was
thinking
of
christmas
eve
but
it
was
of
the
christmas
eve
of
the
year
before
when
he
sat
in
prison
with
a
hundred
other
men
in
stripes
and
listened
to
the
chaplain
talk
of
peace
and
good
will
to
all
men
upon
earth
when
he
had
forgotten
all
men
upon
earth
but
one
and
had
only
hatred
in
his
heart
for
him
vengeance
is
mine
saith
the
lord
that
was
what
the
chaplain
had
thundered
at
him
and
then
as
now
he
thought
of
the
enemy
who
had
betrayed
him
to
the
law
and
had
sworn
away
his
liberty
and
had
robbed
him
of
everything
in
life
except
a
fierce
longing
for
the
day
when
he
could
strike
back
and
strike
to
kill
and
then
while
he
looked
back
hard
into
the
chaplain
eyes
and
now
while
he
splashed
through
the
yellow
mud
thinking
of
that
christmas
eve
buck
shook
his
head
and
then
as
now
his
sullen
heart
answered
mine
the
big
flakes
drifted
to
crotch
and
twig
and
limb
they
gathered
on
the
brim
of
buck
slouch
hat
filled
out
the
wrinkles
in
his
big
coat
whitened
his
hair
and
his
long
mustache
and
sifted
into
the
yellow
twisting
path
that
guided
his
horse
feet
high
above
he
could
see
through
the
whirling
snow
now
and
then
the
gleam
of
a
red
star
he
knew
it
was
the
light
from
his
enemy
window
but
somehow
the
chaplain
voice
kept
ringing
in
his
ears
and
every
time
he
saw
the
light
he
could
help
thinking
of
the
story
of
the
star
that
the
chaplain
told
that
christmas
eve
and
he
dropped
his
eyes
by
and
by
so
as
not
to
see
it
again
and
rode
on
until
the
light
shone
in
his
face
then
he
led
his
horse
up
a
little
ravine
and
hitched
it
among
the
snowy
holly
and
rhododendrons
and
slipped
toward
the
light
there
was
a
dog
somewhere
of
course
and
like
a
thief
he
climbed
over
the
low
and
stole
through
the
tall
grass
until
he
leaned
against
an
with
the
sill
of
the
window
two
feet
above
the
level
of
his
eyes
reaching
above
him
he
caught
a
stout
limb
and
dragged
himself
up
to
a
crotch
of
the
tree
a
mass
of
snow
slipped
softly
to
the
earth
the
branch
creaked
above
the
light
wind
around
the
corner
of
the
house
a
dog
growled
and
he
sat
still
he
had
waited
three
long
years
and
he
had
ridden
two
hard
nights
and
lain
out
two
cold
days
in
the
woods
for
this
and
presently
he
reached
out
very
carefully
and
noiselessly
broke
leaf
and
branch
and
twig
until
a
passage
was
cleared
for
his
eye
and
for
the
point
of
the
pistol
that
was
gripped
in
his
right
hand
a
woman
was
just
disappearing
through
the
kitchen
door
and
he
peered
cautiously
and
saw
nothing
but
darting
shadows
from
one
corner
a
shadow
loomed
suddenly
out
in
human
shape
buck
saw
the
shadowed
gesture
of
an
arm
and
he
cocked
his
pistol
that
shadow
was
his
man
and
in
a
moment
he
would
be
in
a
chair
in
the
chimney
corner
to
smoke
his
pipe
maybe
his
last
pipe
buck
smiled
pure
hatred
made
him
smile
but
it
was
mean
a
mean
and
sorry
thing
to
shoot
this
man
in
the
back
dog
though
he
was
and
now
that
the
moment
had
come
a
wave
of
sickening
shame
ran
through
buck
no
one
of
his
name
had
ever
done
that
before
but
this
man
and
his
people
had
and
with
their
own
lips
they
had
framed
palliation
for
him
what
was
fair
for
one
was
fair
for
the
other
they
always
said
a
poor
man
could
fight
money
in
the
courts
and
so
they
had
shot
from
the
brush
and
that
was
why
they
were
rich
now
and
buck
was
poor
why
his
enemy
was
safe
at
home
and
he
was
out
here
homeless
in
the
buck
thought
of
all
this
but
it
was
no
use
the
shadow
slouched
suddenly
and
disappeared
and
buck
was
glad
with
a
gritting
oath
between
his
chattering
teeth
he
pulled
his
pistol
in
and
thrust
one
leg
down
to
swing
from
the
tree
he
would
meet
him
face
to
face
next
day
and
kill
him
like
a
man
and
there
he
hung
as
rigid
as
though
the
cold
had
suddenly
turned
him
blood
bones
and
marrow
into
ice
the
door
had
opened
and
full
in
the
firelight
stood
the
girl
who
he
had
heard
was
dead
he
knew
now
how
and
why
that
word
was
sent
him
and
now
she
who
had
been
his
sweetheart
stood
before
him
the
wife
of
the
man
he
meant
to
kill
her
lips
moved
he
thought
he
could
tell
what
she
said
git
up
jim
git
up
then
she
went
back
a
flame
flared
up
within
him
now
that
must
have
come
straight
from
the
devil
forge
again
the
shadows
played
over
the
ceiling
his
teeth
grated
as
he
cocked
his
pistol
and
pointed
it
down
the
beam
of
light
that
shot
into
the
heart
of
the
and
waited
the
shadow
of
a
head
shot
along
the
rafters
and
over
the
fireplace
it
was
a
madman
clutching
the
butt
of
the
pistol
now
and
as
his
eye
caught
the
glinting
sight
and
his
heart
thumped
there
stepped
into
the
square
light
of
the
window
a
child
it
was
a
boy
with
yellow
tumbled
hair
and
he
had
a
puppy
in
his
arms
in
front
of
the
fire
the
little
fellow
dropped
the
dog
and
they
began
to
play
yap
yap
yap
buck
could
hear
the
shrill
barking
of
the
fat
little
dog
and
the
joyous
shrieks
of
the
child
as
he
made
his
playfellow
chase
his
tail
round
and
round
or
tumbled
him
head
over
heels
on
the
floor
it
was
the
first
child
buck
had
seen
for
three
years
it
was
child
and
and
in
the
buck
watched
fixedly
they
were
down
on
the
floor
now
rolling
over
and
over
together
and
he
watched
them
until
the
child
grew
tired
and
turned
his
face
to
the
fire
and
lay
still
looking
into
it
buck
could
see
his
eyes
close
presently
and
then
the
puppy
crept
closer
put
his
head
on
his
playmate
chest
and
the
two
lay
thus
asleep
and
still
buck
looked
his
clasp
loosening
on
his
pistol
and
his
lips
loosening
under
his
stiff
mustache
and
kept
looking
until
the
door
opened
again
and
the
woman
crossed
the
floor
a
flood
of
light
flashed
suddenly
on
the
snow
barely
touching
the
tips
of
the
and
he
saw
her
in
the
doorway
saw
her
look
anxiously
into
the
darkness
look
and
listen
a
long
while
buck
dropped
noiselessly
to
the
snow
when
she
closed
the
door
he
wondered
what
they
would
think
when
they
saw
his
tracks
in
the
snow
next
morning
and
then
he
realized
that
they
would
be
covered
before
morning
as
he
started
up
the
ravine
where
his
horse
was
he
heard
the
clink
of
metal
down
the
road
and
the
splash
of
a
horse
hoofs
in
the
soft
mud
and
he
sank
down
behind
a
again
the
light
from
the
cabin
flashed
out
on
the
snow
that
you
jim
yep
and
then
the
child
voice
has
oo
dot
thum
tandy
yep
the
cheery
answer
rang
out
almost
at
buck
ear
and
jim
passed
death
waiting
for
him
behind
the
bush
which
his
left
foot
brushed
shaking
the
snow
from
the
red
berries
down
on
the
crouching
figure
beneath
once
only
far
down
the
dark
jungled
way
with
the
underlying
streak
of
yellow
that
was
leading
him
whither
god
only
knew
once
only
buck
looked
back
there
was
the
red
light
gleaming
faintly
through
the
moonlit
flakes
of
snow
once
more
he
thought
of
the
star
and
once
more
the
chaplain
voice
came
back
to
him
mine
saith
the
lord
just
how
buck
could
not
see
with
himself
in
the
snow
and
back
there
for
life
with
her
and
the
child
but
some
strange
impulse
made
him
bare
his
head
yourn
said
buck
grimly
but
nobody
on
lonesome
not
even
buck
knew
that
it
was
christmas
eve
the
army
of
the
callahan
i
the
dreaded
message
had
come
the
lank
messenger
who
had
brought
it
from
over
black
mountain
dropped
into
a
chair
by
the
stove
and
sank
his
teeth
into
a
great
hunk
of
yellow
cheese
flitter
bill
richmond
waddled
from
behind
his
counter
and
out
on
the
little
platform
in
front
of
his
store
out
there
was
a
group
of
countrymen
lounging
against
the
rickety
fence
or
swinging
on
it
their
heels
clear
of
the
ground
all
whittling
chewing
and
talking
the
matter
over
all
looked
up
at
bill
and
he
looked
down
at
them
running
his
eye
keenly
from
one
to
another
until
he
came
to
one
powerful
young
fellow
loosely
bent
over
a
even
on
him
bill
eyes
stayed
but
a
moment
and
then
were
lifted
higher
in
anxious
thought
the
message
had
come
at
last
and
the
man
who
brought
it
had
heard
it
fall
from
black
tom
own
lips
the
wild
of
kaintuck
were
coming
over
into
virginia
to
get
flitter
bill
store
for
they
were
mountain
unionists
and
bill
was
a
valley
rebel
and
lawful
prey
it
was
past
belief
so
long
had
he
prospered
and
so
well
that
bill
had
come
to
feel
that
he
sat
safe
in
the
hollow
of
god
hand
but
he
now
must
have
protection
and
at
once
from
the
hand
of
man
roaring
fork
sang
lustily
through
the
rhododendrons
to
the
north
yawned
the
gap
through
the
cumberland
mountains
callahan
nose
a
huge
gray
rock
showed
plain
in
the
clear
air
high
above
the
young
foliage
and
under
it
and
on
up
the
rocky
chasm
flashed
flitter
bill
keen
mind
reaching
out
for
help
now
from
virginia
to
alabama
the
southern
mountaineer
was
a
yankee
because
the
national
spirit
of
getting
fresh
impetus
in
and
new
life
from
the
mexican
war
had
never
died
out
in
the
hills
most
likely
it
would
never
have
died
out
anyway
for
the
world
over
any
seed
of
character
individual
or
national
that
is
once
dropped
between
lofty
summits
brings
forth
its
kind
with
deathless
tenacity
year
after
year
only
in
the
kentucky
mountains
there
were
more
slaveholders
than
elsewhere
in
the
mountains
in
the
south
these
naturally
fought
for
their
slaves
and
the
division
thus
made
the
war
personal
and
terrible
between
the
slaveholders
who
dared
to
stay
at
home
and
the
union
home
guards
who
organized
to
drive
them
away
in
bill
little
virginia
valley
of
course
most
of
the
sturdy
farmers
had
shouldered
confederate
muskets
and
gone
to
the
war
those
who
had
stayed
at
home
were
like
bill
confederate
in
sympathy
but
they
lived
in
safety
down
the
valley
while
bill
traded
and
fattened
just
opposite
the
gap
through
which
a
wild
road
ran
over
into
the
wild
kentucky
hills
therein
bill
danger
lay
for
just
at
this
time
the
harlan
home
guard
under
black
tom
having
cleared
those
hills
were
making
ready
like
the
pict
and
scot
of
olden
days
to
descend
on
the
virginia
valley
and
smite
the
lowland
rebels
at
the
mouth
of
the
gap
of
the
and
the
deserters
roundabout
there
were
many
very
many
who
would
stand
in
with
any
man
who
would
keep
their
bellies
full
but
they
were
worthless
even
with
a
leader
and
without
a
leader
of
no
good
at
all
flitter
bill
must
find
a
leader
for
them
and
anywhere
than
in
his
own
fat
self
for
a
leader
of
men
bill
was
not
born
to
be
nor
could
he
see
a
leader
among
the
men
before
him
and
so
standing
there
one
early
morning
in
the
spring
of
with
uplifted
gaze
it
was
no
surprise
to
him
the
coincidence
indeed
became
at
once
one
of
the
articles
of
perfect
faith
in
his
own
star
that
he
should
see
afar
off
a
black
slouch
hat
and
a
jogging
gray
horse
rise
above
a
little
knoll
that
was
in
line
with
the
mouth
of
the
gap
at
once
he
crossed
his
hands
over
his
chubby
stomach
with
a
pious
sigh
and
at
once
a
plan
of
action
began
to
whirl
in
his
little
round
head
before
man
and
beast
were
in
full
view
the
work
was
done
the
hands
were
unclasped
and
flitter
bill
with
a
chuckle
had
slowly
risen
and
was
waddling
back
to
his
desk
in
the
store
it
was
a
pompous
old
buck
who
was
bearing
down
on
the
old
gray
horse
and
under
the
slouch
hat
with
its
flapping
brim
one
mayhall
wells
by
name
there
were
but
few
strands
of
gray
in
his
thick
hair
though
his
years
were
rounding
half
a
century
and
he
sat
the
old
nag
with
erect
dignity
and
perfect
ease
his
bearded
mouth
showed
vanity
immeasurable
and
suggested
a
strength
of
will
that
his
eyes
the
real
seat
of
power
denied
for
while
shrewd
and
keen
they
were
unsteady
in
reality
he
was
a
great
coward
though
strong
as
an
ox
and
whipping
with
ease
every
man
who
could
force
him
into
a
fight
so
that
in
the
whole
man
a
sensitive
observer
would
have
felt
a
peculiar
pathos
as
though
nature
had
given
him
a
desire
to
be
and
no
power
to
become
and
had
then
sent
him
on
his
zigzag
way
never
to
dream
wherein
his
trouble
lay
mornin
mornin
mayhall
all
nodded
and
spoke
except
hence
sturgill
on
the
who
stopped
whittling
and
merely
looked
at
the
big
man
with
narrowing
eyes
tallow
dick
a
yellow
slave
appeared
at
the
corner
of
the
store
and
the
old
buck
beckoned
him
to
come
and
hitch
his
horse
flitter
bill
had
reappeared
on
the
stoop
with
a
piece
of
white
paper
in
his
hand
the
lank
messenger
sagged
in
the
doorway
behind
him

start

with
great
respect

his

seeing
the
game

did
the
crowd
at
once

was
impressing
that

had
some
dangerous
card
up

repeated
significantly

mayhall
began
to
rub
his
hands
together
as
though
the
conflict
were
close
at
hand
and
the
mountaineer
slapped
one
thigh
heartily
good
for
you
give
hell
he
was
about
to
slap
mayhall
on
the
shoulder
and
call
him
pardner
when
flitter
bill
coughed
and
mayhall
lifted
his
chin
captain
wells
said
bill
captain
wells
repeated
mayhall
with
a
stiff
salutation
and
the
messenger
from
over
black
mountain
fell
back
with
an
apologetic
laugh
a
few
minutes
later
both
mayhall
and
flitter
bill
saw
him
shaking
his
head
as
he
started
homeward
toward
the
gap
bill
laughed
silently
but
mayhall
had
grown
grave
the
fun
was
over
and
he
beckoned
bill
inside
the
store
misto
richmond
he
said
with
hesitancy
and
an
entire
change
of
tone
and
manner
i

slowly
and

interrupted
bill
again
and
again
mayhall
stared
hard
it
was
strange
that
bill
could
have
formed
the
habit
of
calling
him
captain
in
so
short
a
time
yestiddy

since

three
times
misto

yes
drawled
bill
with
an
unction
that
was
strangely
sweet
to
mayhall
wondering
ears
an
i
do

wells
an
may
i
axe
you
said
mayhall
ruffling
a
little
may
i
axe
you
why

certainly
said
bill
and
he
handed
over
the
paper
that
he
held
in
his
hand
mayhall
took
the
paper
and
looked
it
up
and
down
helplessly
flitter
bill
slyly
watching
him
mayhall
handed
it
back
if
you
please
misto
richmond
i
left
my
specs
at
home
without
a
smile
bill
began
it
was
an
order
from
the
commandant
at
cumberland
gap
sixty
miles
farther
down
powell
valley
authorizing
mayhall
wells
to
form
a
company
to
guard
the
gap
and
to
protect
the
property
of
confederate
citizens
in
the
valley
and
a
commission
of
captaincy
in
the
said
company
for
the
said
mayhall
wells
mayhall
mouth
widened
to
the
full
stretch
of
his
lean
jaws
and
when
bill
was
through
reading
he
silently
reached
for
the
paper
and
looked
it
up
and
down
and
over
and
over
muttering
well
well
well
and
then
he
pointed
silently
to
the
name
that
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
paper
bill
spelled
out
the
name
and
mayhall
big
fingers
trembled
as
he
pulled
them
away
as
though
to
avoid
further
desecration
of
that
sacred
name
then
he
rose
and
a
magical
transformation
began
that
can
be
likened
i
speak
with
reverence
to
the
turning
of
water
into
wine
captain
mayhall
wells
raised
his
head
set
his
chin
well
in
and
kept
it
there
he
straightened
his
shoulders
and
kept
them
straight
he
paced
the
floor
with
a
tread
that
was
martial
and
once
he
stopped
before
the
door
with
his
right
hand
thrust
under
his
and
with
wrinkling
brow
studied
the
hills
it
was
a
new
man
with
the
water
in
his
blood
changed
to
wine
who
turned
suddenly
on
flitter
bill
richmond
i
can
collect
a
vehy
large
force
in
a
vehy
few
days
flitter
bill
knew
that
that
he
could
get
together
every
loafer
between
the
of
wise
and
the
of
lee
but
he
only
said
encouragingly
good

of
the
confederate
citizens
of

coughed
slightly
there
is
one
thing
in
the
way
i
opine
whar
i
axe

to

somethin

had
anticipated

i
take

o

rubbed
his
hands
of
of

soldier
and
a
patriot

afford
to
feed
as
a
slight
return
fer

dryly
and
with
a
prophetic
stir
of
uneasiness
vehy
vehy
well
i
shall
begin
misto
richmond
and
to
flitter
bill
wonder
the
captain
stalked
out
to
the
stoop
announced
his
purpose
with
the
voice
of
an
auctioneer
and
called
for
volunteers
then
and
there
there
was
dead
silence
for
a
moment
then
there
was
a
smile
here
a
chuckle
there
an
incredulous
laugh
and
hence
sturgill
bully
of
the
pocket
rose
from
the
closed
his
knife
came
slowly
forward
and
cackled
his
scorn
straight
up
into
the
teeth
of
captain
mayhall
wells
the
captain
looked
down
and
began
to
shed
his
coat
i
take
it
hence
sturgill
that
you
air
laughin
at
me
i
am

he
said
contemptuously
but
he
was
surprised
at
the
look
on
the
giant
face
mayhall
wells
ef
you
please
plain
ole
mayhall
wells
said
hence
and
captain
wells
descended
with
no
little
majesty
and
biffed
him
the
delighted
crowd
rose
to
its
feet
and
gathered
around
tallow
dick
came
running
from
the
barn
it
was
biff
biff
and
biff
again
but
not
nip
and
tuck
for
long
captain
mayhall
closed
in
hence
sturgill
struck
the
earth
like
a
homeric
pine
and
the
captain
mighty
arm
played
above
him
and
fell
resounding
in
three
minutes
hence
to
the
amazement
of
the
crowd
roared
but
mayhall
breathed
hard
and
said
quietly
wells
hence
shouted
plain
ole
but
the
captain
huge
fist
was
poised
in
the
air
over
his
face
captain
wells
he
growled
and
the
captain
rose
and
calmly
put
on
his
coat
while
the
crowd
looked
respectful
and
hence
sturgill
staggered
to
one
side
as
though
beaten
in
spirit
strength
and
wits
as
well
the
captain
beckoned
flitter
bill
inside
the
store
his
manner
had
a
distinct
savor
of
patronage
illustration
captain
wells
descended
with
no
little
majesty
and
biffed
him
misto
richmond
he
said
i
make
you
i
appoint
you
by
the
authority
of
jefferson
davis
and
the
confederate
states
of
ameriky
as
of

as
bill
eyes
blinked
at
the
astounding
dignity
of
his
commission
gineral
richmond
i
shall
not
repeat
them
words
and
he
did
but
rose
and
made
his
way
toward
his
old
gray
mare
tallow
dick
held
his
bridle
dick
he
said
jocosely
goin
to
run
away
the
negro
almost
paled
and
then
with
a
look
at
a
blacksnake
whip
that
hung
on
the
barn
door
grinned
no
suh
no

i
ai
suh
no

mounted
the
captain
dropped
a
silver
piece
in
the
startled
negro
hand
then
he
vouchsafed
the
wondering
flitter
bill
and
the
gaping
crowd
a
military
salute
and
started
for
the
yawning
mouth
of
the
gap
riding
with
shoulders
squared
and
chin
well
in
riding
as
should
ride
the
commander
of
the
army
of
the
callahan
flitter
bill
dropped
his
blinking
eyes
to
the
paper
in
his
hand
that
bore
the
commission
of
jefferson
davis
and
the
confederate
states
of
america
to
mayhall
wells
of
callahan
and
went
back
into
his
store
he
looked
at
it
a
long
time
and
then
he
laughed
but
without
much
mirth
ii
grass
had
little
chance
to
grow
for
three
weeks
thereafter
under
the
cowhide
boots
of
captain
mayhall
wells
when
the
twentieth
morning
came
over
the
hills
the
mist
parted
over
the
stars
and
bars
floating
from
the
top
of
a
tall
poplar
up
through
the
gap
and
flaunting
brave
defiance
to
black
tom
his
harlan
home
guard
and
all
other
unionists
of
the
kentucky
hills
it
parted
over
the
army
of
the
callahan
asleep
on
its
arms
in
the
mouth
of
the
chasm
over
flitter
bill
sitting
sullen
and
dejected
on
the
stoop
of
his
store
and
over
tallow
dick
stealing
corn
bread
from
the
kitchen
to
make
ready
for
flight
that
night
through
the
gap
the
mountains
and
to
the
yellow
river
that
was
the
mecca
of
the
runaway
slave
at
the
mouth
of
the
gap
a
ragged
private
stood
before
a
ragged
tent
raised
a
long
dinner
horn
to
his
lips
and
a
mighty
blast
rang
through
the
hills
reveille
and
out
poured
the
army
of
the
callahan
from
shack
and
coverts
of
sticks
and
leaves
with
squirrel
rifles
revolutionary
muskets
shotguns
and
horse
pistols
for
the
duties
of
the
day
under
lieutenant
skaggs
tactician
and
lieutenant
boggs
quondam
terror
of
roaring
fork
that
blast
rang
down
the
valley
into
flitter
bill
ears
and
startled
him
into
action
it
brought
tallow
dick
head
out
of
the
barn
door
and
made
him
grin
dick
flitter
bill
call
was
sharp
and
angry
yes
suh
go
tell
ole
mayhall
wells
that
i
ai
goin
to
send
him
nary
another
pound
o
bacon
an
nary
another
tin
cup
o

no
by
i
ai
half
an
hour
later
the
negro
stood
before
the
ragged
tent
of
the
commander
of
the
army
of
the
callahan
marse
bill
say
he
ai
gwine
to
sen
you
no
mo
rations
no
mo
tallow
dick
repeated
his
message
and
the
captain
scowled
mutiny
fetch
my
hoss
he
thundered
very
naturally
and
very
swiftly
had
the
trouble
come
for
straight
after
the
captain
fight
with
hence
sturgill
there
had
been
a
mighty
rally
to
the
standard
of
mayhall
wells
from
pigeon
creek
the
loafers
came
from
roaring
fork
cracker
neck
from
the
pocket
down
the
valley
and
from
turkey
cove
recruits
came
so
fast
and
to
such
proportions
grew
the
army
of
the
callahan
that
flitter
bill
shrewdly
suggested
at
once
that
captain
wells
divide
it
into
three
companies
and
put
one
up
pigeon
creek
under
lieutenant
jim
skaggs
and
one
on
callahan
under
lieutenant
tom
boggs
while
the
captain
with
a
third
should
guard
the
mouth
of
the
gap
bill
idea
was
to
share
with
those
districts
the
honor
of
his
but
captain
wells
crushed
the
plan
like
a
dried
puffball
yes
he
said
with
fine
sarcasm
what
will
them
kanetuckians
do
then
do
you
know
gineral
richmond
why
i
tell
you
what
they
do
they
jest
swoop
down
on
lieutenant
boggs
and
gobble
him
up
then
they
swoop
down
on
lieutenant
skaggs
on
pigeon
and
gobble
him
up
then
they
swoop
down
on
me
and
gobble
me
up
no
they
wo
gobble
up
but
they
come
damn
nigh
it
an
what
kind
of
a
report
will
i
make
to
jeff
davis
gineral
richmond
in
suh
no
suh
i
jest
keep
lieutenant
boggs
and
lieutenant
skaggs
close
by
me
and
we
pitch
our
camp
right
here
in
the
gap
whar
we
can
pertect
the
property
of
confederate
citizens
and
be
close
to
our
base
o
supplies
suh
that
what
i
do
gineral
richmond
groaned
and
when
in
the
next
breath
the
mighty
captain
casually
inquired
if
uniform
of
had
come
yet
flitter
bill
fat
body
nearly
rolled
off
his
chair
you
will
please
have
it
here
next
monday
said
the
captain
with
great
firmness
it
is
necessary
to
the
proper
discipline
of
my
troops
and
it
was
there
the
following
monday
a
regimental
coat
gray
jeans
trousers
and
a
forage
cap
that
bill
purchased
from
a
passing
morgan
raider
daily
orders
would
come
from
captain
wells
to
general
flitter
bill
richmond
to
send
up
more
rations
and
bill
groaned
afresh
when
a
man
from
callahan
told
how
the
captain
family
was
sprucing
up
on
meal
and
flour
and
bacon
from
the
captain
camp
humiliation
followed
it
had
never
occurred
to
captain
wells
that
being
a
captain
made
it
incongruous
for
him
to
have
a
general
under
him
until
lieutenant
skaggs
who
had
picked
up
a
manual
of
tactics
somewhere
cautiously
communicated
his
discovery
captain
wells
saw
the
point
at
once
there
was
but
one
thing
to
do
to
reduce
general
richmond
to
the
ranks
and
it
was
done
technically
thereafter
the
general
was
purveyor
for
the
army
of
the
callahan
but
to
the
captain
himself
he
was
gallingly
to
the
purveyor
simple
flitter
bill
the
strange
thing
was
that
contrary
to
his
usual
shrewdness
it
should
have
taken
flitter
bill
so
long
to
see
that
the
difference
between
having
his
store
robbed
by
the
kentucky
and
looted
by
captain
wells
was
the
difference
between
and
but
when
he
did
see
he
forged
a
plan
of
relief
at
once
when
the
captain
sent
down
lieutenant
boggs
for
a
supply
of
rations
bill
sent
the
saltiest
rankest
bacon
he
could
find
with
a
message
that
he
wanted
to
see
the
great
man
as
before
when
captain
wells
rode
down
to
the
store
bill
handed
out
a
piece
of
paper
and
as
before
the
captain
had
left
his
specs
at
home
the
paper
was
an
order
that
whereas
the
distinguished
services
of
captain
wells
to
the
confederacy
were
appreciated
by
jefferson
davis
the
said
captain
wells
was
and
is
hereby
empowered
to
duly
and
in
accordance
with
the
tactics
of
war
impress
what
he
shall
see
fit
and
determine
fit
for
the
good
of
his
command
the
news
was
joy
to
the
army
of
the
callahan
before
it
had
gone
the
rounds
of
the
camp
lieutenant
boggs
had
spied
a
fat
heifer
browsing
on
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
ordered
her
surrounded
and
driven
down
without
another
word
when
she
was
close
enough
he
raised
his
gun
and
would
have
shot
her
dead
in
her
tracks
had
he
not
been
arrested
by
a
yell
of
command
and
horror
from
his
superior
air
you
to
have
me
cashiered
and
shot
lieutenant
boggs
fer
violatin
the
ticktacks
of
war
roared
the
captain
indignantly
you
know
that
i
got
to
that
heifer
accordin
to
the
rules
an
regulations
git
roun
that
heifer
the
men
surrounded
her
take
her
by
the
horns
now
in
the
name
of
jefferson
davis
and
the
confederate
states
of
ameriky
i
hereby
and
hereon
do
duly
impress
this
heifer
for
the
purposes
and
use
of
the
army
of
the
callahan
so
help
me
god
shoot
her
down
bill
boggs
shoot
her
down
now
naturally
the
soldiers
preferred
fresh
meat
and
they
got
it
impressing
cattle
sheep
and
hogs
geese
chickens
and
ducks
vegetables
nothing
escaped
the
capacious
maw
of
the
army
of
the
callahan
it
was
a
beautiful
idea
and
the
success
of
it
pleased
flitter
bill
mightily
but
the
relief
did
not
last
long
an
indignant
murmur
rose
up
and
down
valley
and
creek
bottom
against
the
outrages
and
one
angry
old
farmer
took
a
at
captain
wells
with
a
squirrel
rifle
clipping
the
visor
of
his
forage
cap
and
from
that
day
the
captain
began
to
call
with
immutable
regularity
again
on
flitter
bill
for
bacon
and
meal
that
morning
the
last
straw
fell
in
a
demand
for
a
of
rations
to
be
delivered
before
noon
and
worn
to
the
edge
of
his
patience
bill
had
sent
a
reckless
refusal
and
now
he
was
waiting
on
the
stoop
of
his
store
looking
at
the
mouth
of
the
gap
and
waiting
for
it
to
give
out
into
the
valley
captain
wells
and
his
old
gray
mare
and
at
last
late
in
the
afternoon
there
was
the
captain
coming
coming
at
a
swift
gallop
and
bill
steeled
himself
for
the
onslaught
like
a
knight
in
a
joust
against
a
charging
antagonist
the
captain
saluted
stiffly
pulling
up
sharply
and
making
no
move
to
dismount
purveyor
he
said
black
tom

just
sent

captain
mayhall
wells
chuckled
an
he
says

fust
though
have

the
captain
dropped
the
titular
address
now
and
threw
one
leg
over
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
flitter
bill
richmond
he
said
with
great
nonchalance
i
axe

you
prefer
that
i
should
disband

army
of
the
callahan
or

silent
a
full
minute
and
his
face
grew
stern
flitter
bill
richmond
i

no

army
of

o
bacon
and
meal
and
drive
it
up

the
negro
gave
a
swift
glance
to
his
master
and
flitter
bill
feebly
waved
acquiescence
purveyor
i
wish
you
bill
gazed
after
the
great
captain
in
dazed
wonder
was
this
the
man
who
had
come
cringing
to
him
only
a
few
short
weeks
ago
and
groaned
aloud
but
for
lucky
or
unlucky
coincidence
how
could
the
prophet
ever
have
gained
name
and
fame
on
earth
captain
wells
rode
back
to
camp
chuckling
chuckling
with
satisfaction
and
pride
but
the
chuckle
passed
when
he
caught
sight
of
his
tent
in
front
of
it
were
his
lieutenants
and
some
half
a
dozen
privates
all
plainly
in
great
agitation
and
in
the
midst
of
them
stood
the
lank
messenger
who
had
brought
the
first
message
from
black
tom
delivering
another
from
the
same
source
black
tom
coming
coming
surer
and
unless
that
flag
that
rebel
rag
were
hauled
down
under
hours
black
tom
would
come
over
and
pull
it
down
and
to
that
same
poplar
hang
captain
mayhall
an
his
whole
damn
army
black
tom
might
do
it
anyhow
just
for
fun
while
the
privates
listened
the
captain
strutted
and
swore
then
he
rested
his
hand
on
his
hip
and
smiled
with
silent
sarcasm
and
then
swore
again
while
the
respectful
lieutenants
and
the
awed
soldiery
of
the
callahan
looked
on
finally
he
spoke
ah
when
did
black
tom
say
that
he
inquired
casually
yestiddy
mornin
he
said
he
was
goin
to
start
over
hyeh
early
this
mornin
the
captain
whirled
what
then
why
did
you
git
over
hyeh
mornin

git
across
the
river
last
night
then
he
i
reckon
black
tom
be
hyeh
in
about
two
hours
mebbe
he
ai
fer
away
now
the
captain
was
startled
lieutenant
skaggs
he
called
sharply
git
yo
men
out
thar
an
draw
up
in
two
rows
the
face
of
the
student
of
military
tactics
looked
horrified
the
captain
in
his
excitement
had
relaxed
into
language
that
was
distinctly
agricultural
and
catching
the
look
on
his
subordinate
face
and
at
the
same
time
the
reason
for
it
he
roared
indignantly
air
you
afeer
sir
git
yo
men
out
i
said
an
march
up
thar
in
front
of
the
gap
lieutenant
boggs
take
ten
men
and
march
at
double
quick
through
the
gap
an
defend
that
poplar
with
yo
life
blood
if
you
air
overwhelmed
by
superior
numbers
fall
back
suh
step
by
step
until
you
air
by
lieutenant
skaggs
if
you
two
air
not
able
to
hold
the
enemy
in
check
you
may
count
on
me
an
the
army
of
the
callahan
to
grind
how
the
captain
now
thoroughly
aroused
to
all
the
fine
terms
of
war
did
roll
that
technical
him
under
his
tongue
to
grind
him
to
pieces
them
towerin
rocks
and
plunge
him
in
the
foilin
waters
of
roarin
fawk
forward
suh
double
quick
lieutenant
skaggs
touched
his
cap
lieutenant
boggs
looked
embarrassed
and
strode
nearer
captain
whar
am
i
goin
to
git
ten
men
to
face
them
kanetuckians
whar
air
they
goin
to
git
a
to
lead
you
better
say
said
the
captain
severely
fearing
that
some
of
the
soldiers
had
heard
the
question
if
you
air
afeer
suh
and
then
he
saw
that
no
one
had
heard
and
he
winked
winked
with
most
unmilitary
familiarity
air
you
a
good
climber
lieutenant
boggs
lieutenant
boggs
looked
mystified
but
he
said
he
was
lieutenant
boggs
i
now
give
you
the
opportunity
to
show
yo
profound
knowledge
of
the
ticktacks
of
war
you
may
now
be
guilty
of
disobedience
of
ordahs
and
i
will
not
have
you
for
the
same
in
other
words
if
after
a
survey
of
the
situation
you
think
best
why
the
captain
voice
dropped
to
a
hoarse
whisper
pull
that
flag
down
lieutenant
boggs
pull
her
down
iii
it
was
an
hour
by
sun
now
lieutenant
boggs
and
his
devoted
band
of
ten
were
making
their
way
slowly
and
watchfully
up
the
mighty
chasm
the
lieutenant
with
his
hand
on
his
sword
and
his
head
bare
and
bowed
in
thought
the
kentuckians
were
on
their
way
at
that
moment
they
might
be
riding
full
speed
toward
the
mouth
of
pigeon
where
floated
the
flag
they
might
gobble
him
and
his
command
up
when
they
emerged
from
the
gap
suppose
they
caught
him
up
that
tree
his
command
might
escape
but
would
be
up
there
saving
them
the
trouble
of
stringing
him
up
all
they
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
send
up
after
him
a
man
with
a
rope
and
let
him
drop
that
was
enough
lieutenant
boggs
called
a
halt
and
explained
the
real
purpose
of
the
expedition
we
will
wait
here
till
dark
he
said
so
them
kanetuckians
ketch
us
whilst
we
are
climbing
that
tree
and
so
they
waited
opposite
bee
rock
which
was
making
ready
to
blossom
with
purple
rhododendrons
and
the
reserve
back
in
the
gap
under
lieutenant
skaggs
waited
waited
too
the
army
of
the
callahan
at
the
mouth
of
the
gap
and
waited
restlessly
captain
wells
at
the
door
of
his
tent
and
flitter
bill
on
the
stoop
of
his
store
waited
everybody
but
tallow
dick
who
in
the
general
confusion
was
slipping
through
the
rhododendrons
along
the
bank
of
roaring
fork
until
he
could
climb
the
and
slip
through
the
gap
high
over
the
army
head
what
could
have
happened
when
dusk
was
falling
captain
wells
dispatched
a
messenger
to
lieutenant
skaggs
and
his
reserve
and
got
an
answer
lieutenant
skaggs
feared
that
boggs
had
been
captured
without
the
firing
of
a
single
shot
but
the
flag
was
floating
still
an
hour
later
lieutenant
skaggs
sent
another
message
he
could
not
see
the
flag
captain
wells
answered
stoutly
hold
yo
own
and
so
as
darkness
fell
the
army
of
the
callahan
waited
in
the
strain
of
mortal
expectancy
as
one
man
and
flitter
bill
waited
with
his
horse
standing
saddled
in
the
barn
ready
for
swift
flight
and
as
darkness
fell
tallow
dick
was
cautiously
picking
his
way
alongside
the
steep
wall
of
the
gap
toward
freedom
and
picking
it
with
stealthy
caution
foot
by
foot
for
up
there
to
this
day
big
loose
rocks
mount
halfway
to
the
jagged
points
of
the
black
cliffs
and
a
careless
step
would
have
detached
one
and
sent
an
avalanche
of
rumbling
stones
down
to
betray
him
a
single
shot
rang
suddenly
out
far
up
through
the
gap
and
the
startled
negro
sprang
forward
slipped
and
with
a
low
frightened
oath
lay
still
another
shot
followed
and
another
then
a
hoarse
murmur
rose
loudened
into
thunder
and
ended
in
a
frightful
boom
one
yell
rang
from
the
army
throat
the
kentuckians
the
kentuckians
the
wild
terrible
kentuckians
captain
wells
sprang
into
the
air
my
god
they
got
a
cannon
then
there
was
a
martial
chorus
the
crack
of
rifle
the
hoarse
cough
of
the
roar
of
old
muskets
bing
bang
boom
bing
bing
bang
bang
boom
boom
bing
bang
boom
lieutenant
skaggs
and
his
reserves
heard
the
beat
of
running
feet
down
the
gap
they
gobbled
boggs
he
said
and
the
reserve
rushed
after
him
as
he
fled
the
army
heard
the
beat
of
their
coming
feet
they
gobbled
skaggs
the
army
said
then
was
there
bedlam
as
the
army
fled
a
crashing
through
bushes
a
splashing
into
the
river
the
rumble
of
mule
wagons
yells
of
terror
swift
flying
shapes
through
the
pale
moonlight
flitter
bill
heard
the
din
as
he
stood
by
his
barn
door
they
gobbled
the
army
said
flitter
bill
and
he
too
fled
like
a
shadow
down
the
valley
nature
never
explodes
such
wild
and
senseless
energy
as
when
she
lets
loose
a
mob
in
a
panic
with
the
army
it
was
each
man
for
himself
and
devil
take
the
hindmost
and
the
flight
of
the
army
was
like
a
flight
from
the
very
devil
himself
lieutenant
boggs
whose
feet
were
the
swiftest
in
the
hills
outstripped
his
devoted
band
lieutenant
skaggs
being
fat
and
slow
fell
far
behind
his
reserve
and
dropped
exhausted
on
a
rock
for
a
moment
to
get
his
breath
as
he
rose
panting
to
resume
flight
a
figure
bounded
out
of
the
darkness
behind
him
and
he
gathered
it
in
silently
and
went
with
it
to
the
ground
where
both
fought
silently
in
the
dust
until
they
rolled
into
the
moonlight
and
each
looked
the
other
in
the
face
that
you
jim
skaggs
that
you
tom
boggs
then
the
two
lieutenants
rose
swiftly
but
a
third
shape
bounded
into
the
road
a
gigantic
figure
black
tom
with
a
startled
yell
they
gathered
him
in
one
by
the
waist
the
other
about
the
neck
and
for
a
moment
the
terrible
kentuckian
it
could
be
none
other
swung
the
two
clear
of
the
ground
but
the
doughty
lieutenants
hung
to
him
boggs
trying
to
get
his
knife
and
skaggs
his
pistol
and
all
went
down
in
a
heap
i
surrender
i
surrender
it
was
the
giant
who
spoke
and
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
both
men
ceased
to
struggle
and
strange
to
say
no
one
of
the
three
laughed
lieutenant
boggs
said
captain
wells
thickly
take
yo
thumb
out
my
mouth
lieutenant
skaggs
leggo
my
leg
an
stop
bitin
me
sh
sh
sh
said
all
three
the
faint
swish
of
bushes
as
lieutenant
boggs
ten
men
scuttled
into
the
brush
behind
them
the
distant
beat
of
the
army
feet
getting
fainter
ahead
of
them
and
then
silence
dead
dead
silence
sh
sh
sh
with
the
red
streaks
of
dawn
captain
mayhall
wells
was
pacing
up
and
down
in
front
of
flitter
bill
store
a
gaping
crowd
about
him
and
the
shattered
remnants
of
the
army
drawn
up
along
roaring
fork
in
the
rear
an
hour
later
flitter
bill
rode
calmly
in
i
stayed
all
night
down
the
valley
said
flitter
bill
uncle
jim
richmond
was
sick
i
hear
you
had
some
trouble
last
night
captain
wells
the
captain
expanded
his
chest
trouble
he
repeated
sarcastically
and
then
he
told
how
a
charging
horde
of
daredevils
had
driven
him
from
camp
with
overwhelming
numbers
and
one
piece
of
artillery
how
he
had
rallied
the
army
and
fought
them
back
foot
by
foot
and
put
them
to
fearful
rout
how
the
army
had
fallen
back
again
just
when
the
kentuckians
were
running
like
sheep
and
how
he
himself
had
stayed
in
the
rear
with
lieutenant
boggs
and
lieutenant
skaggs
to
cover
their
retreat
suh
and
how
the
purveyor
if
he
would
just
go
up
through
the
gap
would
doubtless
find
the
cannon
that
the
enemy
had
left
behind
in
their
flight
it
was
just
while
he
was
thus
telling
the
tale
for
the
twentieth
time
that
two
figures
appeared
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
drew
near
hence
sturgill
on
horseback
and
tallow
dick
on
foot
i
ketched
this
nigger
in
my
this
mornin
said
hence
simply
and
flitter
bill
glared
and
without
a
word
went
for
the
blacksnake
that
hung
by
the
barn
door
for
the
time
captain
wells
started
his
tale
again
and
with
every
pause
that
he
made
for
breath
hence
cackled
scorn
an
hence
sturgill
ef
you
will
jus
go
up
in
the
gap
you
find
a
cannon
captured
suh
by
me
an
the
army
of
the
callahan

in

and
tallow
dick

up
grinning
i
done
it
what
shouted
flitter
bill
i
kicked
a
rock
loose
climbin
over
callahan
nose
bill
dropped
his
whip
with
a
chuckle
of
pure
ecstasy
mayhall
paled
and
stared
the
crowd
roared
the
army
of
the
callahan
grinned
and
hence
climbed
back
on
his
horse
mayhall
wells
he
said
plain
ole
mayhall
wells
i
see
you
on
couht
day
i
ai
got
time
now
and
he
rode
away
illustration
speak
up
nigger
iv
that
day
captain
mayhall
wells
and
the
army
of
the
callahan
were
in
disrepute
next
day
the
awful
news
of
lee
surrender
came
captain
wells
refused
to
believe
it
and
still
made
heroic
effort
to
keep
his
shattered
command
together
looking
for
recruits
on
court
day
he
was
twitted
about
the
rout
of
the
army
by
hence
sturgill
whose
chance
to
redeem
himself
had
come
again
as
several
times
before
the
captain
declined
to
fight
his
health
was
essential
to
the
general
but
hence
laughed
in
his
face
and
the
captain
had
to
face
the
music
though
the
heart
of
him
was
gone
he
fought
well
for
he
was
fighting
for
his
all
and
he
knew
it
he
could
have
whipped
with
ease
and
he
did
whip
but
the
spirit
of
the
thoroughbred
was
not
in
captain
mayhall
wells
he
had
sturgill
down
but
hence
sank
his
teeth
into
mayhall
thigh
while
mayhall
hands
grasped
his
opponent
throat
the
captain
had
only
to
squeeze
as
every
fighter
knew
and
endure
his
pain
until
hence
would
have
to
give
in
but
mayhall
was
not
built
to
endure
he
roared
like
a
bull
as
soon
as
the
teeth
met
in
his
flesh
his
fingers
relaxed
and
to
the
disgusted
surprise
of
everybody
he
began
to
roar
with
great
distinctness
and
agony
the
end
was
come
and
nobody
knew
it
better
than
mayhall
wells
he
rode
home
that
night
with
hands
folded
on
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
and
his
beard
crushed
by
his
chin
against
his
breast
for
the
last
time
next
morning
he
rode
down
to
flitter
bill
store
on
the
way
he
met
parson
kilburn
and
for
the
last
time
mayhall
wells
straightened
his
shoulders
and
for
one
moment
more
resumed
his
part
perhaps
the
parson
had
not
heard
of
his
fall
parsing
he
said
pleasantly
ah
where
have
you
been
the
parson
was
returning
from
cumberland
gap
whither
he
had
gone
to
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
by
the
way
i
have
something
here
for
you
which
flitter

he
said
handing

back
i
hev
left
my

at

the
parson
read
that
whereas
captain
wells
had
been
guilty
of
grave
misdemeanors
while
in
command
of
the
army
of
the
callahan
he
should
be
arrested
and
for
the
same
or
be
given
the
privilege
of
leaving
the
county
in

mayhall
face
paled
a
little
and
he
stroked
his
beard
ah

anybody
but
you
know
about
this
ordah
parsing
nobody
well
if
you
will

me

a
living

me
and
my
ole
gray
hoss
and
my
household
furniture
we
be
in
kanetuck
afore
daybreak
mornin
and
he
was
but
he
rode
on
just
then
and
presented
himself
for
the
last
time
at
the
store
of
flitter
bill
bill
was
sitting
on
the
stoop
in
his
favorite
posture
and
in
a
moment
there
stood
before
him
plain
mayhall
wells
holding
out
the
order
bill
had
given
the
parson
that
day
misto
richmond
he
said
i
have
come
to
tell
you
now
just
above
the
selfish
layers
of
fat
under
flitter
bill
chubby
hands
was
a
very
kind
heart
when
he
saw
mayhall
old
manner
and
heard
the
old
respectful
way
of
address
and
felt
the
dazed
helplessness
of
the
big
beaten
man
the
heart
thumped
i
am
sorry
about
that
little
amount
i
owe
you
i
think
i
be
able
shortly
but
bill
cut
him
short
mayhall
wells
beaten
disgraced
driven
from
home
on
charge
of
petty
crimes
of
which
he
was
undoubtedly
guilty
but
for
which
bill
knew
he
himself
was
responsible
mayhall
on
his
way
into
exile
and
still
persuading
himself
and
at
that
moment
almost
persuading
him
that
he
meant
to
pay
that
little
debt
of
long
ago
was
too
much
for
flitter
bill
and
he
proceeded
to
lie
lying
with
deliberation
and
pleasure
captain
wells
he
said
and
the
emphasis
on
the
title
was
balm
to
mayhall
soul
you
have
protected
me
in
time
of
war
an
you
air
welcome
to
yo
uniform
an
you
air
welcome
to
that
little
debt
yes
he
went
on
reaching
down
into
his
pocket
and
pulling
out
a
roll
of
bills
i
tender
you
in
payment
for
that
same
protection
the
regular
pay
of
a
officer
in
the
confederate
service
and
he
handed
out
the
army
pay
for
three
months
in
confederate
greenbacks
an
five
dollars
in
money
of
the
united
states
of
which
i
an
doubtless
you
suh
air
true
and
loyal
citizens
captain
wells
i
bid
you
an
i
wish
ye
well
i
wish
ye
well
from
the
stoop
of
his
store
bill
watched
the
captain
ride
away
drooping
at
the
shoulders
and
with
his
hands
folded
on
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
his
dim
blue
eyes
misty
the
jaunty
forage
cap
a
mockery
of
his
hair
and
the
flaps
of
his
coat
fanning
either
side
like
mournful
wings
and
flitter
bill
muttered
to
himself
atter
he
gone
long
enough
fer
these
things
to
blow
over
i
going
to
bring
him
back
and
give
him
another
chance
yes
damme
if
i
do
git
him
back
and
bill
dropped
his
remorseful
eye
to
the
order
in
his
hand
like
the
handwriting
of
the
order
that
lifted
mayhall
like
magic
into
power
the
handwriting
of
this
order
that
dropped
him
like
a
stone
was
flitter
bill
own
the
pardon
of
becky
day
the
missionary
was
young
and
she
was
from
the
north
her
brows
were
straight
her
nose
was
rather
high
and
her
eyes
were
clear
and
gray
the
upper
lip
of
her
little
mouth
was
so
short
that
the
teeth
just
under
it
were
never
quite
concealed
it
was
the
mouth
of
a
child
and
it
gave
the
face
with
all
its
strength
and
high
purpose
a
peculiar
pathos
that
no
soul
in
that
little
mountain
town
had
the
power
to
see
or
feel
a
yellow
mule
was
hitched
to
the
rickety
fence
in
front
of
her
and
she
stood
on
the
stoop
of
a
little
white
with
an
elm
switch
between
her
teeth
and
gloves
on
her
hands
which
were
white
and
looked
strong
the
mule
wore
a
man
saddle
but
no
matter
the
streets
were
full
of
yellow
pools
the
mud
was
and
she
was
on
her
way
to
the
of
becky
day
there
was
a
flood
that
morning
all
the
preceding
day
the
rains
had
drenched
the
high
slopes
unceasingly
that
night
the
forks
of
the
kentucky
got
yellow
and
rose
high
and
now
they
crashed
together
around
the
town
and
after
a
heaving
conflict
started
the
river
on
one
quivering
majestic
sweep
to
the
sea
nobody
gave
heed
that
the
girl
rode
a
mule
or
that
the
saddle
was
not
her
own
and
both
facts
she
herself
quickly
forgot
this
half
log
half
frame
house
on
a
corner
had
stood
a
siege
once
she
could
yet
see
bullet
holes
about
the
door
through
this
window
a
revenue
officer
from
the
blue
grass
had
got
a
bullet
in
the
shoulder
from
a
garden
in
the
rear
standing
in
the
door
only
just
one
month
before
she
herself
had
seen
children
scurrying
like
rabbits
through
the
fences
men
running
silently
here
and
there
men
dodging
into
doorways
fire
flashing
in
the
street
and
from
every
house
and
not
a
sound
but
the
crack
of
pistol
and
winchester
for
the
mountain
men
deal
death
in
all
the
terrible
silence
of
death
and
now
a
preacher
with
a
long
scar
across
his
forehead
had
come
to
the
one
little
church
in
the
place
and
the
fervor
of
religion
was
struggling
with
feudal
hate
for
possession
of
the
town
to
the
girl
who
saw
a
symbol
in
every
mood
of
the
earth
the
passions
of
these
primitive
people
were
like
the
treacherous
streams
of
the
uplands
now
quiet
as
sunny
skies
and
now
clashing
together
with
but
little
less
fury
and
with
much
more
noise
and
the
roar
of
the
flood
above
the
wind
that
late
afternoon
was
the
wrath
of
the
father
that
with
the
peace
of
the
son
so
long
on
earth
such
things
still
could
be
once
more
trouble
was
threatening
and
that
day
even
she
knew
that
trouble
might
come
but
she
rode
without
fear
for
she
went
when
and
where
she
pleased
as
any
woman
can
throughout
the
cumberland
without
insult
or
harm
at
the
end
of
the
street
were
two
houses
that
seemed
to
front
each
other
with
unmistakable
enmity
in
them
were
two
men
who
had
wounded
each
other
only
the
day
before
and
who
that
day
would
lead
the
factions
if
the
old
feud
broke
loose
again
one
house
was
close
to
the
frothing
hem
of
the
flood
a
with
a
shed
of
rough
boards
for
a
kitchen
the
home
of
becky
day
the
other
was
across
the
way
and
was
framed
and
smartly
painted
on
the
steps
sat
a
woman
with
her
head
bare
and
her
hands
under
her
apron
widow
of
the
marcum
whose
death
from
a
bullet
one
month
before
had
broken
the
long
truce
of
the
feud
a
groaning
curse
was
growled
from
the
window
as
the
girl
drew
near
and
she
knew
it
came
from
a
wounded
marcum
who
had
lately
come
back
from
the
west
to
avenge
his
death
why
do
you
go
over
to
see
your
neighbor
the
girl
clear
eyes
gave
no
hint
that
she
knew
as
she
well
did
the
trouble
between
the
houses
and
the
widow
stared
in
sheer
amazement
for
mountaineers
do
not
talk
with
strangers
of
the
quarrels
between
them
i
have
nothin
to
do
with
such
as
her
she
said
sullenly
she
the
kind
do
said
the
girl
with
a
flush
she
dying
yes
with
the
word
the
girl
sprang
from
the
mule
and
threw
the
reins
over
the
pale
of
the
fence
in
front
of
the
across
the
way
in
the
doorway
she
turned
as
though
she
would
speak
to
the
woman
on
the
steps
again
but
a
tall
man
with
a
black
beard
appeared
in
the
low
door
of
the
how
is
your
how
is
mrs
day
mighty
puny
this
mornin
becky
is
the
girl
slipped
into
the
dark
room
on
a
disordered
pillowless
bed
lay
a
white
face
with
eyes
closed
and
mouth
slightly
open
near
the
bed
was
a
low
wood
fire
on
the
hearth
were
several
thick
cups
filled
with
herbs
and
heavy
fluids
and
covered
with
tarpaulin
for
becky
man
was
a
teamster
with
a
few
touches
of
the
girl
quick
hands
the
covers
of
the
bed
were
smooth
and
the
woman
eyes
rested
on
the
girl
own
cloak
with
her
own
handkerchief
she
brushed
the
from
the
forehead
that
already
seemed
growing
cold
at
her
first
touch
the
woman
eyelids
opened
and
dropped
together
again
her
lips
moved
but
no
sound
came
from
them
in
a
moment
the
ashes
disappeared
the
hearth
was
clean
and
the
fire
was
blazing
every
time
the
girl
passed
the
window
she
saw
the
widow
across
the
way
staring
hard
at
the
hut
when
she
took
the
ashes
into
the
street
the
woman
spoke
to
her
i
ca
go
to
see
becky
she
hates
me
with
good
reason
the
answer
came
with
a
clear
sharpness
that
made
the
widow
start
and
redden
angrily
but
the
girl
walked
straight
to
the
gate
her
eyes
ablaze
with
all
the
courage
that
the
mountain
woman
knew
and
yet
with
another
courage
to
which
the
primitive
creature
was
a
stranger
a
courage
that
made
the
widow
lower
her
own
eyes
and
twist
her
hands
under
her
apron
i
want
you
to
come
and
ask
becky
to
forgive
you
the
woman
stared
and
laughed
forgive
me
becky
forgive
me
she
would
an
i
do
want
her
she
could
not
look
up
into
the
girl
eyes
but
she
pulled
a
pipe
from
under
the
apron
laid
it
down
with
a
trembling
hand
and
began
to
rock
slightly
the
girl
leaned
across
the
gate
look
at
me
she
said
sharply
the
woman
raised
her
eyes
swerved
them
once
and
then
in
spite
of
herself
held
them
steady
listen
do
you
want
a
dying
woman
curse
it
was
a
straight
thrust
to
the
core
of
a
superstitious
heart
and
a
spasm
of
terror
crossed
the
woman
face
she
began
to
wring
her
hands
come
on
said
the
girl
sternly
and
turned
without
looking
back
until
she
reached
the
door
of
the
hut
where
she
beckoned
and
stood
waiting
while
the
woman
started
slowly
and
helplessly
from
the
steps
still
wringing
her
hands
inside
behind
her
the
wounded
marcum
who
had
been
listening
raised
himself
on
one
elbow
and
looked
after
her
through
the
window
she
ca
come
in
not
while
i
in
here
the
girl
turned
quickly
it
was
dave
day
the
teamster
in
the
kitchen
door
and
his
face
looked
blacker
than
his
beard
oh
she
said
simply
as
though
hurt
and
then
with
a
dignity
that
surprised
her
the
teamster
turned
and
strode
towards
the
back
door
but
i
can
git
out
i
reckon
he
said
and
he
never
looked
at
the
widow
who
had
stopped
frightened
at
the
gate
oh
i
ca
i
she
said
and
her
voice
broke
but
the
girl
gently
pushed
her
to
the
door
where
she
stopped
again
leaning
against
the
lintel
across
the
way
the
wounded
marcum
with
a
scowl
of
wonder
crawled
out
of
his
bed
and
started
painfully
to
the
door
the
girl
saw
him
and
her
heart
beat
fast
inside
becky
lay
with
closed
eyes
she
stirred
uneasily
as
though
she
felt
some
hated
presence
but
her
eyes
stayed
fast
for
the
presence
of
death
in
the
room
was
stronger
still
becky
at
the
broken
cry
becky
eyes
flashed
wide
and
fire
broke
through
the
haze
that
had
gathered
in
them
i
want
ye
ter
fergive
me
becky
the
eyes
burned
steadily
for
a
long
time
for
two
days
she
had
not
spoken
but
her
voice
came
now
as
though
from
the
grave
you
she
said
and
again
with
torturing
scorn
you
and
then
she
smiled
for
she
knew
why
her
enemy
was
there
and
her
hour
of
triumph
was
come
the
girl
moved
swiftly
to
the
window
she
could
see
the
wounded
marcum
slowly
crossing
the
street
pistol
in
hand
what
i
ever
do
to

into
the
window

the
girl
imperiously
and
the
man
lifted
his
heavy
eyes
dropped
one
elbow
on
the
and
waited

the
widow

face
with

she
raised
her
right
hand
as
though
with
it
she
would
hurl
the
curse
behind
her
lips
and
the
widow
with
a
cry
sprang
for
the
bony
fingers
catching
them
in
her
own
hand
and
falling
over
on
her
knees
at
the
bedside
do
becky
do
do
there
was
a
slight
rustle
at
the
back
window
at
the
other
a
pistol
flashed
into
sight
and
dropped
again
below
the
sill
turning
the
girl
saw
dave
bushy
black
head
he
too
with
one
elbow
on
the
sill
and
the
other
hand
out
of
sight
shame
she
said
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
two
men
who
had
learned
at
last
the
bottom
truth
of
the
feud
and
then
she
caught
the
sick
woman
other
hand
and
spoke
quickly
hush
becky
she
said
and
at
the
touch
of
her
hand
and
the
sound
of
her
voice
becky
looked
confusedly
at
her
and
let
her
upraised
hand
sink
back
to
the
bed
the
widow
stared
swiftly
from
jim
brother
at
one
window
to
dave
day
at
the
other
and
hid
her
face
on
her
arms
remember
becky
how
can
you
expect
forgiveness
in
another
world
unless
you
forgive
in
this
the
woman
brow
knitted
and
she
lay
quiet
like
the
widow
who
held
her
hand
the
dying
woman
believed
with
never
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
somewhere
above
the
stars
a
living
god
reigned
in
a
heaven
of
happiness
that
somewhere
beneath
the
earth
a
personal
devil
gloated
over
souls
in
eternal
torture
that
whether
she
went
above
or
below
hung
solely
on
her
last
hour
of
contrition
and
that
in
heaven
or
hell
she
would
know
those
whom
she
might
meet
as
surely
as
she
had
known
them
on
earth
by
and
by
her
face
softened
and
she
drew
a
long
breath
jim

a
good
man
she
said
and
then
after
a
moment
an
i
was
a
good
woman
she
turned
her
eyes
towards
the
girl
until
jim
married

she
got
calm
and
while
she
spoke
to
the
widow

looked
at

girl

she
repeated
looking
at
jim

that

nothin
agin
dave
the
girl
turned
wo
you
dave
i
waitin
to
hear
whut
becky
says
becky
was
listening
though
her
eyes
were
closed
her
brows
knitted
painfully
it
was
a
hard
compromise
that
she
was
asked
to
make
i
between
mortal
hate
and
a
love
that
was
more
than
mortal
but
the
plea
that
has
stood
between
them
for
nearly
twenty
centuries
prevailed
and
the
girl
knew
that
the
end
of
the
feud
was
nigh
becky
nodded
yes
i
fergive
her
an
i
want
to
shake
hands
but
not
once
did
she
turn
her
eyes
to
the
woman
whom
she
forgave
and
the
hand
that
the
widow
held
gave
back
no
answering
pressure
the
faces
at
the
windows
disappeared
and
she
motioned
for
the
girl
to
take
her
weeping
enemy
away
she
did
not
open
her
eyes
when
the
girl
came
back
but
her
lips
moved
and
the
girl
bent
above
her
i
know
whar
jim
is
from
somewhere
outside
came
dave
cough
and
the
dying
woman
turned
her
head
as
though
she
were
reminded
of
something
she
had
quite
forgotten
then
straightway
she
forgot
again
the
voice
of
the
flood
had
deepened
a
smile
came
to
becky
lips
a
faint
terrible
smile
of
triumph
the
girl
bent
low
and
with
a
startled
face
shrank
back
i
git
thar
with
that
whisper
went
becky
last
breath
but
the
smile
was
there
even
when
her
lips
were
cold
a
crisis
for
the
guard
the
tutor
was
from
new
england
and
he
was
precisely
what
passes
with
southerners
as
typical
he
was
thin
he
wore
spectacles
he
talked
dreamy
abstractions
and
he
looked
clerical
indeed
his
ancestors
had
been
clergymen
for
generations
and
by
nature
and
principle
he
was
an
apostle
of
peace
and
a
he
had
just
come
to
the
gap
a
cleft
in
the
cumberland
mountains
to
prepare
two
young
blue
grass
kentuckians
for
harvard
the
railroad
was
still
thirty
miles
away
and
he
had
travelled
through
mudholes
on
which
as
the
joke
ran
a
traveller
was
supposed
to
leave
his
card
before
he
entered
and
disappeared
that
his
successor
might
not
unknowingly
press
him
too
hard
i
do
know
that
in
those
mudholes
mules
were
sometimes
drowned
the
tutor
gray
mule
fell
over
a
bank
with
him
and
he
would
have
gone
back
had
he
not
feared
what
was
behind
more
than
anything
that
was
possible
ahead
he
was
sore
tired
and
dispirited
when
he
reached
the
gap
but
still
plucky
and
full
of
business
he
wanted
to
see
his
pupils
at
once
and
arrange
his
schedule
they
came
in
after
supper
and
i
had
to
laugh
when
i
saw
his
mild
eyes
open
the
boys
were
only
fifteen
and
seventeen
but
each
had
around
him
a
huge
revolver
and
a
belt
of
cartridges
which
he
unbuckled
and
laid
on
the
table
after
shaking
hands
the
tutor
shining
glasses
were
raised
to
me
for
light
i
gave
it
my
brothers
had
just
come
in
from
a
little
police
duty
i
explained
everybody
was
a
policeman
at
the
gap
i
added
and
naturally
he
still
looked
puzzled
but
he
began
at
once
to
question
the
boys
about
their
studies
and
in
an
hour
he
had
his
daily
schedule
mapped
out
and
submitted
to
me
i
had
to
cover
my
mouth
with
my
hand
when
i
came
to
one
item
exercise
a
walk
of
half
an
hour
every
wednesday
afternoon
between
five
and
six
for
the
younger
known
since
at
harvard
as
the
colonel
and
known
then
at
the
gap
as
the
infant
of
the
guard
winked
most
irreverently
as
he
had
just
come
back
from
a
chase
down
the
valley
on
horseback
after
a
bad
butcher
and
as
either
was
apt
to
have
a
like
experience
any
and
every
day
i
was
not
afraid
they
would
fail
to
get
exercise
enough
so
i
let
that
item
of
the
tutor
pass
the
tutor
slept
in
my
room
that
night
and
my
four
brothers
the
eldest
of
whom
was
a
lieutenant
on
the
police
guard
in
a
room
across
the
hallway
i
explained
to
the
tutor
that
there
was
much
lawlessness
in
the
region
that
we
foreigners
were
trying
to
build
a
town
and
that
to
ensure
law
and
order
we
had
all
become
volunteer
policemen
he
seemed
to
think
it
was
most
interesting
about
three
in
the
morning
a
shrill
whistle
blew
and
from
habit
i
sprang
out
of
bed
i
had
hardly
struck
the
floor
when
four
pairs
of
heavy
boots
thundered
down
the
stairs
just
outside
the
door
and
i
heard
a
gasp
from
the
startled
tutor
he
was
bolt
upright
in
bed
and
his
face
in
the
moonlight
was
white
with
fear
wha
wha
what
that
i
told
him
it
was
a
police
whistle
and
that
the
boys
were
answering
it
everybody
jumped
when
he
heard
a
whistle
i
explained
for
nobody
in
town
was
permitted
to
blow
one
except
a
policeman
i
guessed
there
would
be
enough
men
answering
that
whistle
without
me
however
and
i
slipped
back
into
bed
well
he
said
and
when
the
boys
lumbered
upstairs
again
and
one
shouted
through
the
door
all
right
the
tutor
said
again
with
emphasis
well
next
day
there
was
to
be
a
political
gathering
at
the
gap
a
senator
was
trying
to
lift
himself
by
his
own
into
the
chair
he
was
going
to
make
a
speech
there
would
be
a
big
and
unruly
crowd
and
it
would
be
a
crucial
day
for
the
guard
so
next
morning
i
suggested
to
the
tutor
that
it
would
be
unwise
for
him
to
begin
work
with
his
pupils
that
day
for
the
reason
that
he
was
likely
to
be
greatly
interrupted
and
often
he
thought
however
he
would
like
to
begin
he
did
begin
and
within
half
an
hour
gordon
the
town
sergeant
thrust
his
head
inside
the
door
and
called
the
colonel
by
name
come
on
he
said
they
going
to
try
that
d
n
butcher
and
seeing
from
the
tutor
face
that
he
had
done
something
dreadful
he
slammed
the
door
in
apologetic
confusion
the
tutor
was
and
it
was
the
law
that
called
the
colonel
and
so
the
tutor
let
him
go
nay
went
with
him
and
heard
the
case
the
butcher
had
gone
off
on
another
horse
the
man
owed
him
money
he
said
and
the
only
way
he
could
get
his
money
was
to
take
the
horse
as
security
but
the
sergeant
did
not
know
this
and
he
and
the
colonel
rode
after
him
and
the
colonel
having
the
swifter
horse
but
not
having
had
time
to
get
his
own
pistol
took
the
sergeant
and
went
ahead
he
fired
quite
close
to
the
running
butcher
twice
and
the
butcher
thought
it
wise
to
halt
when
he
saw
the
child
who
had
captured
him
he
was
speechless
and
he
got
off
his
horse
and
cut
a
big
switch
to
give
the
colonel
a
whipping
but
the
doughty
infant
drew
down
on
him
again
and
made
him
ride
foaming
with
rage
back
to
town
the
butcher
was
at
the
trial
however
and
the
tutor
heard
him
say
with
a
great
guffaw
an
i
believe
the
d
n
little
fool
would
shot
me
once
more
the
tutor
looked
at
the
pupil
whom
he
was
to
lead
into
the
classic
halls
of
harvard
and
once
more
he
said
well
people
were
streaming
into
town
now
and
i
persuaded
the
tutor
that
there
was
no
use
for
him
to
begin
his
studies
again
he
said
he
would
go
fishing
down
the
river
and
take
a
swim
he
would
get
back
in
time
to
hear
the
speaking
in
the
afternoon
so
i
got
him
a
horse
and
he
came
out
with
a
long
cane
and
a
pair
of
i
told
him
that
he
must
watch
the
old
nag
or
she
would
run
away
with
him
particularly
when
he
started
homeward
the
tutor
was
not
much
of
a
centaur
the
horse
started
as
he
was
throwing
the
wrong
leg
over
his
saddle
and
the
tutor
clamped
his
rod
under
one
arm
clutching
for
the
reins
with
both
hands
and
kicking
for
his
stirrups
with
both
feet
the
tip
of
the
limber
pole
beat
the
horse
flank
gently
as
she
struck
a
trot
and
smartly
as
she
struck
into
a
lope
and
so
with
arms
feet
and
flapping
towards
different
points
of
the
compass
the
tutor
passed
out
of
sight
over
poplar
hill
on
a
dead
run
as
soon
as
he
could
get
over
a
fit
of
laughter
and
catch
his
breath
the
colonel
asked
do
you
know
what
he
had
in
those
no
a
bathing
suit
he
shouted
and
he
went
off
again
not
even
in
a
primeval
forest
it
seemed
would
the
modest
puritan
bare
his
body
to
the
mirror
of
limpid
water
and
the
caress
of
mountain
air
the
trouble
had
begun
early
that
morning
when
gordon
the
town
sergeant
stepped
from
his
door
and
started
down
the
street
with
no
little
he
had
been
arraying
himself
for
a
full
hour
and
after
a
and
a
shave
he
stepped
spic
and
span
into
the
street
with
his
head
steadily
held
high
except
when
he
bent
it
to
look
at
the
shine
of
his
boots
which
was
the
work
of
his
own
hands
and
of
which
he
was
proud
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
sergeant
felt
that
he
looked
just
as
he
particularly
wanted
to
look
on
that
day
his
best
gordon
was
a
native
of
wise
but
that
day
a
girl
was
coming
from
lee
and
he
was
ready
for
her
opposite
the
intermont
a
cracked
from
cherokee
avenue
and
from
habit
he
started
that
way
logan
the
captain
of
the
guard
the
leading
lawyer
in
that
part
of
the
state
was
ahead
of
him
however
and
he
called
to
gordon
to
follow
gordon
ran
in
the
grass
along
the
road
to
keep
those
boots
out
of
the
dust
somebody
had
fired
off
his
pistol
for
fun
and
was
making
tracks
for
the
river
as
they
pushed
the
miscreant
close
he
dashed
into
the
river
to
wade
across
it
was
a
very
cold
morning
and
gordon
prayed
that
the
captain
was
not
going
to
be
such
a
fool
as
to
follow
the
fellow
across
the
river
he
should
have
known
better
in
with
you
said
the
captain
quietly
and
the
mirror
of
the
shining
boots
was
dimmed
and
the
icy
water
chilled
the
sergeant
to
the
knees
and
made
him
so
mad
that
he
flashed
his
pistol
and
told
the
runaway
to
halt
which
he
did
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
it
was
richards
the
tough
from
the
pocket
and
as
he
paid
his
fine
promptly
they
had
to
let
him
go
gordon
went
back
put
on
his
everyday
clothes
and
got
his
billy
and
his
whistle
and
prepared
to
see
the
maid
from
lee
when
his
duty
should
let
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
saw
her
but
once
and
then
he
was
not
made
happy
the
people
had
come
in
rapidly
giants
from
the
crab
orchard
mountaineers
from
through
the
gap
and
from
cracker
neck
and
thunderstruck
knob
valley
people
from
little
from
the
furnace
site
and
bum
hollow
and
wildcat
and
people
from
lee
from
turkey
cove
and
from
the
pocket
the
pocket
far
down
in
the
river
hills
they
came
on
foot
and
on
horseback
and
left
their
horses
in
the
bushes
and
crowded
the
streets
and
filled
the
saloon
of
one
jack
woods
who
had
the
cackling
laugh
of
satan
and
did
not
like
the
guard
for
good
reasons
and
whose
particular
pleasure
was
to
persuade
some
customer
to
stir
up
a
hornet
nest
of
trouble
from
the
saloon
the
crowd
moved
up
towards
the
big
spring
at
the
foot
of
imboden
hill
where
under
beautiful
beeches
was
built
the
speakers
platform
precisely
at
three
the
local
orator
much
flurried
rose
ran
his
hand
through
his
long
hair
and
looked
in
silence
over
the
crowd
fellow
citizens
there
beauty
in
the
stars
of
night
and
in
the
glowin
orb
of
day
there
beauty
in
the
rollin
meadow
and
in
the
quiet
stream
there
beauty
in
the
smilin
valley
and
in
the
everlastin
hills
therefore
fellow
citizens
therefore
fellow
citizens
allow
me
to
introduce
to
you
the
future
governor
of
these
united
states
senator
william
bayhone
and
he
sat
down
with
such
a
beatific
smile
of
that
a
fiend
would
not
have
had
the
heart
to
say
he
had
not
won
now
there
are
wandering
minstrels
yet
in
the
cumberland
hills
they
play
fiddles
and
go
about
making
up
ballets
that
involve
local
history
sometimes
they
make
a
pretty
good
verse
this
for
instance
about
a
feud
the
death
of
these
two
men
caused
great
trouble
in
our
land
caused
men
to
leave
their
families
and
take
the
parting
hand
retaliation
still
at
war
may
never
never
cease
i
would
that
i
could
only
see
our
land
once
more
at
peace
there
was
a
minstrel
out
in
the
crowd
and
pretty
soon
he
struck
up
his
fiddle
and
his
lay
and
he
did
not
exactly
sing
the
virtues
of
billy
bayhone
evidently
some
partisan
thought
he
ought
for
he
smote
him
on
the
thigh
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
and
raised
such
a
stir
as
a
rude
stranger
might
had
he
smitten
a
troubadour
in
arthur
court
the
crowd
thickened
and
surged
and
four
of
the
guard
emerged
with
the
fiddler
and
his
assailant
under
arrest
it
was
as
though
the
valley
were
a
sheet
of
water
straightway
and
the
fiddler
the
dropping
of
a
stone
for
the
ripple
of
mischief
started
in
every
direction
it
caught
two
mountaineers
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd
who
for
no
particular
reason
thumped
each
other
with
their
huge
fists
and
were
swiftly
led
away
by
that
silent
guard
the
operation
of
a
mysterious
force
was
in
the
air
and
it
puzzled
the
crowd
somewhere
a
whistle
would
blow
and
from
this
point
and
that
a
quiet
young
man
would
start
swiftly
toward
it
the
crowd
got
restless
and
uneasy
and
by
and
by
experimental
and
defiant
for
in
that
crowd
was
the
spirit
of
bunker
hill
and
king
mountain
it
could
fiddle
and
sing
it
settle
its
little
troubles
after
the
good
old
fashion
of
fist
and
skull
it
could
charge
up
and
down
the
streets
on
horseback
if
it
pleased
it
could
ride
over
those
puncheon
sidewalks
it
could
drink
openly
and
without
shame
and
shades
of
the
american
eagle
and
the
stars
and
stripes
it
could
even
yell
no
wonder
like
the
heathen
it
raged
what
did
these
blanked
furriners
have
against
them
anyhow
they
could
run
country
not
much
pretty
soon
there
came
a
shrill
whistle
far
then
another
and
another
it
sounded
ominous
indeed
and
it
was
being
a
signal
of
distress
from
the
infant
of
the
guard
who
stood
before
the
door
of
jack
woods
saloon
with
his
pistol
levelled
on
richards
the
tough
from
the
pocket
the
infant
standing
there
with
blazing
eyes
alone
and
in
the
heart
of
a
gathering
storm
now
the
chain
of
lawlessness
that
had
tightened
was
curious
and
significant
there
was
the
tough
and
his
kind
lawless
irresponsible
and
possible
in
any
community
there
was
the
who
had
come
to
town
with
the
wild
son
of
his
employer
an
honest
farmer
came
too
a
friend
of
the
farmer
who
had
not
yet
reaped
the
crop
of
wild
oats
sown
in
his
youth
whiskey
ran
all
into
one
mould
the
drank
with
the
tough
the
wild
son
with
the
and
the
three
drank
together
and
got
the
farmer
unregenerate
friend
to
drink
with
them
and
he
and
the
farmer
himself
by
and
by
took
a
drink
for
old
time
sake
now
the
cardinal
command
of

your

it

take
whiskey
long
to
make
friends
jack
woods
had
given
the
tough
from
the
pocket
a
whistle
you
dasse
blow
it
said
he
richards
asked
why
and
jack
told
him
straightway
the
tough
blew
the
whistle
and
when
the
little
colonel
ran
down
to
arrest
him
he
laughed
and
resisted
and
the
wild
son
and
the
and
jack
woods
showed
an
inclination
to
take
his
part
so
holding
his
drop
on
the
tough
with
one
hand
the
infant
blew
vigorously
for
help
with
the
other
logan
the
captain
arrived
first
he
usually
arrived
first
and
gordon
the
sergeant
was
by
his
side
gordon
was
always
by
his
side
he
would
have
stormed
a
battery
if
the
captain
had
led
him
and
the
captain
would
have
led
him
alone
if
he
thought
it
was
his
duty
logan
was
as
calm
as
a
stage
hero
at
the
crisis
of
a
play
the
crowd
had
pressed
close
take
that
man
he
said
sharply
pointing
to
the
tough
whom
the
colonel
held
covered
and
two
men
seized
him
from
behind
the
drew
his
gun
no
you
do
he
shouted
take
said
the
captain
quietly
and
he
was
seized
by
two
more
and
disarmed
it
was
then
that
sturgeon
the
wild
son
ran
up
you
ca
take
that
man
to
jail
he
shouted
with
an
oath
pointing
at
the
the
captain
waved
his
hand
and
as
two
of
the
guard
approached
sturgeon
started
for
his
gun
now
sturgeon
was
gordon
blood
cousin
but
gordon
levelled
his
own
pistol
sturgeon
weapon
caught
in
his
pocket
and
he
tried
to
pull
it
loose
the
moment
he
succeeded
gordon
stood
ready
to
fire
twice
the
hammer
of
the
sergeant
pistol
went
back
almost
to
the
and
then
as
he
pulled
the
trigger
again
macfarlan
first
lieutenant
who
once
played
lacrosse
at
yale
rushed
parting
the
crowd
right
and
left
and
dropped
his
billy
lightly
three
times
right
left
and
right
on
sturgeon
head
the
blood
spurted
the
head
fell
back
between
the
bully
shoulders
his
grasp
on
his
pistol
loosened
and
he
sank
to
his
knees
for
a
moment
the
crowd
was
stunned
by
the
lightning
quickness
of
it
all
it
was
the
first
blow
ever
struck
in
that
country
with
a
piece
of
wood
in
the
name
of
the
law
take
on
boys
called
the
captain
whose
face
had
paled
a
little
though
he
seemed
as
cool
as
ever
and
the
boys
started
dragging
the
three
struggling
prisoners
and
the
crowd
growing
angrier
and
angrier
pressed
close
behind
a
hundred
of
them
led
by
the
farmer
himself
a
giant
in
size
and
beside
himself
with
rage
and
humiliation
once
he
broke
through
the
guard
line
and
was
pushed
back
knives
and
pistols
began
to
flash
now
everywhere
and
loud
threats
and
curses
rose
on
all
sides
the
men
should
not
be
taken
to
jail
the
sergeant
dragging
sturgeon
looked
up
into
the
blazing
eyes
of
a
girl
on
the
sidewalk
sturgeon
sister
the
maid
from
lee
the
sergeant
groaned
logan
gave
some
order
just
then
to
the
infant
who
ran
ahead
and
by
the
time
the
guard
with
the
prisoners
had
backed
to
a
corner
there
were
two
lines
of
guards
drawn
across
the
street
the
first
line
let
the
prisoners
and
their
captors
through
closed
up
behind
and
backed
slowly
towards
the
corner
where
it
meant
to
stand
it
was
very
exciting
there
winchesters
and
shotguns
protruded
from
the
line
threateningly
but
the
mob
came
on
as
though
it
were
going
to
press
through
and
determined
faces
blenched
with
excitement
but
not
with
fear
a
moment
later
the
little
colonel
and
the
guards
on
either
side
of
him
were
jabbing
at
men
with
cocked
winchesters
at
that
moment
it
would
have
needed
but
one
shot
to
ring
out
to
have
started
an
awful
carnage
but
not
yet
was
there
a
man
in
the
mob
and
that
is
the
trouble
with
mobs
who
seemed
willing
to
make
a
sacrifice
of
himself
that
the
others
might
gain
their
end
for
one
moment
they
halted
cursing
and
waving
their
pistols
preparing
for
a
charge
and
in
that
crucial
moment
the
tutor
from
new
england
came
like
a
thunderbolt
to
the
rescue
shrieks
of
terror
from
children
shrieks
of
outraged
modesty
from
women
rent
the
air
down
the
street
where
the
huddled
crowd
was
rushing
right
and
left
in
wild
confusion
and
through
the
parting
crowd
the
tutor
flew
into
sight
on
horseback
bareheaded
barefooted
clad
in
a
gaudily
striped
bathing
suit
with
his
flapping
behind
him
like
wings
some
mischievous
mountaineers
seeing
him
in
his
bathing
suit
on
the
point
of
a
rock
up
the
river
had
joyously
taken
a
or
two
at
him
and
the
tutor
had
mounted
his
horse
and
fled
but
he
came
as
welcome
and
as
effective
as
an
emissary
straight
from
the
god
of
battles
though
he
came
against
his
will
for
his
old
nag
was
frantic
and
was
running
away
men
women
and
children
parted
before
him
and
gaping
mouths
widened
as
he
passed
the
impulse
of
the
crowd
ran
faster
than
his
horse
and
even
the
enraged
mountaineers
in
amazed
wonder
sprang
out
of
his
way
and
far
in
the
rear
a
few
privileged
ones
saw
the
frantic
horse
plunge
towards
his
stable
stop
suddenly
and
pitch
his
mottled
rider
through
the
door
and
mercifully
out
of
sight
human
purpose
must
give
way
when
a
pure
miracle
comes
to
earth
to
baffle
it
it
gave
way
now
long
enough
to
let
the
oaken
doors
of
the
calaboose
close
behind
tough
and
the
farmer
wild
son
the
line
of
winchesters
at
the
corner
quietly
gave
way
the
power
of
the
guard
was
established
the
backbone
of
the
opposition
broken
henceforth
the
work
for
law
and
order
was
to
be
easy
compared
with
what
it
had
been
up
at
the
big
spring
under
the
beeches
sat
the
disgusted
orator
of
the
day
and
the
disgusted
senator
who
seriously
was
quite
sure
that
the
guard
being
composed
of
democrats
had
taken
this
way
to
shatter
his
campaign
next
morning
in
court
the
members
of
the
guard
acted
as
witnesses
against
the
culprits
macfarlan
stated
that
he
had
struck
sturgeon
over
the
head
to
save
his
life
and
sturgeon
after
he
had
paid
his
fine
said
he
would
prefer
being
shot
to
being
clubbed
to
death
and
he
bore
dangerous
malice
for
a
long
time
until
he
learned
what
everybody
else
knew
that
macfarlan
always
did
what
he
thought
he
ought
and
never
spoke
anything
but
the
literal
truth
whether
it
hurt
friend
foe
or
himself
after
court
richards
the
tough
met
gordon
the
sergeant
in
the
road
gordon
he
said
you
swore
to
a
lie
about
me
a
while
ago
how
do
you
want
to
fight
asked
gordon
fair
come
on
and
gordon
started
for
the
town
limits
across
the
river
richards
following
on
horseback
at
a
store
gordon
unbuckled
his
belt
and
tossed
his
pistol
and
his
police
badge
inside
jack
woods
seeing
this
followed
and
the
infant
seeing
woods
followed
too
the
law
was
law
but
this
affair
was
personal
and
would
be
settled
without
the
limits
of
law
and
local
obligation
richards
tried
to
talk
to
gordon
but
the
sergeant
walked
with
his
head
down
as
though
he
could
not
hear
he
was
too
enraged
to
talk
while
richards
was
hitching
his
horse
in
the
bushes
the
sergeant
stood
on
the
bank
of
the
river
with
his
arms
folded
and
his
chin
swinging
from
side
to
side
when
he
saw
richards
in
the
open
he
rushed
for
him
like
a
young
bull
that
feels
the
first
swelling
of
his
horns
it
was
not
a
fair
english
fight
but
a
scotch
tussle
in
which
either
could
strike
kick
bite
or
gouge
after
a
few
blows
they
clinched
and
whirled
and
fell
gordon
on
top
with
which
advantage
he
began
to
pound
the
tough
from
the
pocket
savagely
woods
made
as
if
to
pull
him
off
but
the
infant
drew
his
pistol
keep
off
he
killing
him
shouted
woods
halting
let
him
holler
then
said
the
infant
he
killing
him
shouted
woods
let
gordon
friends
take
him
off
then
said
the
infant
do
touch
him
and
it
was
done
richards
was
senseless
and
speechless
he
really
could
shout
enough
but
he
was
content
and
the
day
left
a
very
satisfactory
impression
on
him
and
on
his
friends
if
they
misbehaved
in
town
they
would
be
arrested
that
was
plain
but
it
was
also
plain
that
if
anybody
had
a
personal
grievance
against
one
of
the
guard
he
could
call
him
out
of
the
town
limits
and
get
satisfaction
after
the
way
of
his
fathers
there
was
nothing
personal
at
all
in
the
attitude
of
the
guard
towards
the
outsiders
which
recognition
was
a
great
stride
toward
mutual
understanding
and
final
high
regard
all
that
day
i
saw
that
something
was
troubling
the
tutor
from
new
england
it
was
the
moral
sense
of
the
puritan
at
work
i
supposed
and
that
night
when
i
came
in
with
a
new
supply
of
billies
and
gave
one
to
each
of
my
brothers
the
tutor
looked
up
over
his
glasses
and
cleared
his
throat
now
said
i
to
myself
we
shall
catch
it
hot
on
the
savagery
of
the
south
and
the
barbarous
method
of
keeping
it
down
but
before
he
had
said
three
words
the
colonel
looked
as
though
he
were
going
to
get
up
and
slap
the
little
dignitary
on
the
back
which
would
have
created
a
sensation
indeed
have
you
an
extra
one
of
those
those
billies
i
said
wonderingly
yes
i
i
believe
i
shall
join
the
guard
myself
said
the
tutor
from
new
england
christmas
night
with
satan
no
night
was
this
in
hades
with
dante
for
satan
was
only
a
woolly
little
black
dog
and
surely
no
dog
was
ever
more
absurdly
misnamed
when
uncle
carey
first
heard
that
name
he
asked
gravely
why
dinnie
where
in
h
uncle
carey
gulped
slightly
did
you
get
him
and
dinnie
laughed
merrily
for
she
saw
the
fun
of
the
question
and
shook
her
black
curls
he
did
come
distinctly
satan
had
not
come
from
that
place
on
the
contrary
he
might
by
a
miracle
have
dropped
straight
from
some
happy
for
all
the
signs
he
gave
of
having
touched
pitch
in
this
or
another
sphere
nothing
human
was
ever
born
that
was
gentler
merrier
more
trusting
or
more
lovable
than
satan
that
was
why
uncle
carey
said
again
gravelyt
hat
he
could
hardly
tell
satan
and
his
little
mistress
apart
he
rarely
saw
them
apart
and
as
both
had
black
tangled
hair
and
bright
black
eyes
as
one
awoke
every
morning
with
a
happy
smile
and
the
other
with
a
jolly
bark
as
they
played
all
day
like
shadows
and
each
won
every
heart
at
first
sight
the
likeness
was
really
rather
curious
i
have
always
believed
that
satan
made
the
spirit
of
dinnie
house
orthodox
and
severe
though
it
was
almost
kindly
toward
his
great
namesake
i
know
i
have
never
been
able
since
i
knew
little
satan
to
think
old
satan
as
bad
as
i
once
painted
him
though
i
am
sure
the
little
dog
had
many
pretty
tricks
that
the
old
boy
doubtless
has
never
used
in
order
to
amuse
his
friends
shut
the
door
saty
please
dinnie
would
say
precisely
as
she
would
say
it
to
uncle
billy
the
butler
and
straightway
satan
would
launch
himself
at
it
bang
he
never
would
learn
to
close
it
softly
for
satan
liked
that
bang
if
you
kept
tossing
a
coin
or
marble
in
the
air
satan
would
keep
catching
it
and
putting
it
back
in
your
hand
for
another
throw
till
you
got
tired
then
he
would
drop
it
on
a
piece
of
rag
carpet
snatch
the
carpet
with
his
teeth
throw
the
coin
across
the
room
and
rush
for
it
like
mad
until
he
got
tired
if
you
put
a
penny
on
his
nose
he
would
wait
until
you
counted
one
two
then
he
would
toss
it
up
himself
and
catch
it
thus
perhaps
satan
grew
to
love
mammon
right
well
but
for
another
and
better
reason
than
that
he
liked
simply
to
throw
it
around
as
shall
now
be
made
plain
a
rubber
ball
with
a
hole
in
it
was
his
favorite
plaything
and
he
would
take
it
in
his
mouth
and
rush
around
the
house
like
a
child
squeezing
it
to
make
it
whistle
when
he
got
a
new
ball
he
would
hide
his
old
one
away
until
the
new
one
was
the
worse
worn
of
the
two
and
then
he
would
bring
out
the
old
one
again
if
dinnie
gave
him
a
nickel
or
a
dime
when
they
went
satan
would
rush
into
a
store
rear
up
on
the
counter
where
the
rubber
balls
were
kept
drop
the
coin
and
get
a
ball
for
himself
thus
satan
learned
finance
he
began
to
hoard
his
pennies
and
one
day
uncle
carey
found
a
pile
of
seventeen
under
a
corner
of
the
carpet
usually
he
carried
to
dinnie
all
coins
that
he
found
in
the
street
but
he
showed
one
day
that
he
was
going
into
the
for
himself
uncle
carey
had
given
dinnie
a
nickel
for
some
candy
and
as
usual
satan
trotted
down
the
street
behind
her
as
usual
satan
stopped
before
the
shop
tum
on
saty
said
dinnie
satan
reared
against
the
door
as
he
always
did
and
dinnie
said
again
tum
on
saty
as
usual
satan
dropped
to
his
haunches
but
what
was
unusual
he
failed
to
bark
now
dinnie
had
got
a
new
ball
for
satan
only
that
morning
so
dinnie
stamped
her
foot
illustration
satan
would
drop
the
coin
and
get
a
ball
for
himself
i
tell
you
to
turn
on
saty
satan
never
moved
he
looked
at
dinnie
as
much
as
to
say
i
have
never
disobeyed
you
before
little
mistress
but
this
time
i
have
an
excellent
reason
for
what
must
seem
to
you
very
bad
manners
and
being
a
gentleman
withal
satan
rose
on
his
haunches
and
begged
you
des
a
pig
saty
said
dinnie
but
with
a
sigh
for
the
candy
that
was
not
to
be
dinnie
opened
the
door
and
satan
to
her
wonder
rushed
to
the
counter
put
his
forepaws
on
it
and
dropped
from
his
mouth
a
dime
satan
had
found
that
coin
on
the
street
he
did
bark
for
change
nor
beg
for
two
balls
but
he
had
got
it
in
his
woolly
little
head
somehow
that
in
that
store
a
coin
meant
a
ball
though
never
before
nor
afterward
did
he
try
to
get
a
ball
for
a
penny
satan
slept
in
uncle
carey
room
for
of
all
people
after
dinnie
satan
loved
uncle
carey
best
every
day
at
noon
he
would
go
to
an
upstairs
window
and
watch
the
cars
come
around
the
corner
until
a
very
tall
young
man
swung
to
the
ground
and
down
satan
would
scamper
yelping
to
meet
him
at
the
gate
if
uncle
carey
after
supper
and
when
dinnie
was
in
bed
started
out
of
the
house
still
in
his
business
clothes
satan
would
leap
out
before
him
knowing
that
he
too
might
be
allowed
to
go
but
if
uncle
carey
had
put
on
black
clothes
that
showed
a
big
dazzling
and
picked
up
his
high
hat
satan
would
sit
perfectly
still
and
look
disconsolate
for
as
there
were
no
parties
or
theatres
for
dinnie
so
there
were
none
for
him
but
no
matter
how
late
it
was
when
uncle
carey
came
home
he
always
saw
little
black
nose
against
the
and
heard
his
bark
of
welcome
after
intelligence
satan
chief
trait
was
lovableness
nobody
ever
knew
him
to
fight
to
snap
at
anything
or
to
get
angry
after
lovableness
it
was
politeness
if
he
wanted
something
to
eat
if
he
wanted
dinnie
to
go
to
bed
if
he
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
door
he
would
beg
beg
prettily
on
his
haunches
his
little
red
tongue
out
and
his
funny
little
paws
hanging
loosely
indeed
it
was
just
because
satan
was
so
little
less
than
human
i
suppose
that
old
satan
began
to
be
afraid
he
might
have
a
soul
so
the
wicked
old
namesake
with
the
hoofs
and
horns
laid
a
trap
for
little
satan
and
as
he
is
apt
to
do
he
began
laying
it
early
long
indeed
before
christmas
when
dinnie
started
to
kindergarten
that
autumn
satan
found
that
there
was
one
place
where
he
could
never
go
like
the
lamb
he
could
not
go
to
school
so
while
dinnie
was
away
satan
began
to
make
friends
he
would
bark
to
every
dog
that
passed
his
gate
many
stopped
to
rub
noses
with
him
through
the
fence
even
hugo
the
mastiff
and
nearly
all
indeed
except
one
dog
that
appeared
every
morning
at
precisely
nine
and
took
his
stand
on
the
corner
there
he
would
lie
patiently
until
a
funeral
came
along
and
then
satan
would
see
him
take
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
procession
and
then
he
would
march
out
to
the
cemetery
and
back
again
nobody
knew
where
he
came
from
nor
where
he
went
and
uncle
carey
called
him
the
funeral
dog
and
said
he
was
doubtless
looking
for
his
dead
master
satan
even
made
friends
with
a
scrawny
little
yellow
dog
that
followed
an
old
drunkard
around
a
dog
that
when
his
master
fell
in
the
gutter
would
go
and
catch
a
policeman
by
the
lead
the
officer
to
his
helpless
master
and
spend
the
night
with
him
in
jail
by
and
by
satan
began
to
slip
out
of
the
house
at
night
and
uncle
billy
said
he
reckoned
satan
had
jined
de
club
and
late
one
night
when
he
had
not
come
in
uncle
billy
told
uncle
carey
that
it
was
powerful
slippery
and
he
reckoned
they
better
send
de
kerridge
after
him
an
innocent
remark
that
made
uncle
carey
send
a
boot
after
the
old
butler
who
fled
chuckling
down
the
stairs
and
left
uncle
carey
chuckling
in
his
room
satan
had
jined
de
club
the
big
club
and
no
dog
was
too
lowly
in
satan
eyes
for
admission
for
no
priest
ever
preached
the
brotherhood
of
man
better
than
satan
lived
it
both
with
man
and
dog
and
thus
he
lived
it
that
christmas
night
to
his
sorrow
christmas
eve
had
been
gloomy
the
gloomiest
of
satan
life
uncle
carey
had
gone
to
a
neighboring
town
at
noon
satan
had
followed
him
down
to
the
station
and
when
the
train
departed
uncle
carey
had
ordered
him
to
go
home
satan
took
his
time
about
going
home
not
knowing
it
was
christmas
eve
he
found
strange
things
happening
to
dogs
that
day
the
truth
was
that
policemen
were
shooting
all
dogs
found
that
were
without
a
collar
and
a
license
and
every
now
and
then
a
bang
and
a
howl
somewhere
would
stop
satan
in
his
tracks
at
a
little
yellow
house
on
the
edge
of
town
he
saw
half
a
dozen
strange
dogs
in
a
kennel
and
every
now
and
then
a
negro
would
lead
a
new
one
up
to
the
house
and
deliver
him
to
a
big
man
at
the
door
who
in
return
would
drop
something
into
the
negro
hand
while
satan
waited
the
old
drunkard
came
along
with
his
little
dog
at
his
heels
paused
before
the
door
looked
a
moment
at
his
faithful
follower
and
went
slowly
on
satan
little
knew
the
old
drunkard
temptation
for
in
that
yellow
house
people
had
offered
fifteen
cents
for
each
dog
brought
to
them
without
a
license
that
they
might
mercifully
put
it
to
death
and
fifteen
cents
was
the
precise
price
for
a
drink
of
good
whiskey
just
then
there
was
another
bang
and
another
howl
somewhere
and
satan
trotted
home
to
meet
a
calamity
dinnie
was
gone
her
mother
had
taken
her
out
in
the
country
to
grandmother
dean
to
spend
christmas
as
was
the
family
custom
and
dean
would
not
wait
any
longer
for
satan
so
she
told
uncle
billy
to
bring
him
out
after
supper
ai
you
o
suh
said
the
old
butler
keepin
me
from
ketchin
christmas
gifts
dis
day
uncle
billy
was
indignant
for
the
negroes
begin
at
four
in
the
afternoon
of
christmas
eve
to
slip
around
corners
and
jump
from
hiding
places
to
shout
christmas
gif
christmas
gif
and
the
one
who
shouts
first
gets
a
gift
no
wonder
it
was
gloomy
for
satan
uncle
carey
dinnie
and
all
gone
and
not
a
soul
but
uncle
billy
in
the
big
house
every
few
minutes
he
would
trot
on
his
little
black
legs
upstairs
and
downstairs
looking
for
his
mistress
as
dusk
came
on
he
would
every
now
and
then
howl
plaintively
after
begging
his
supper
and
while
uncle
billy
was
hitching
up
a
horse
in
the
stable
satan
went
out
in
the
yard
and
lay
with
his
nose
between
the
close
panels
of
the
fence
quite
when
he
saw
his
old
friend
hugo
the
mastiff
trotting
into
the
gaslight
he
began
to
bark
his
delight
frantically
the
big
mastiff
stopped
and
nosed
his
sympathy
through
the
fence
for
a
moment
and
walked
slowly
on
satan
frisking
and
barking
along
inside
at
the
gate
hugo
stopped
and
raising
one
huge
paw
playfully
struck
it
the
gate
flew
open
and
with
a
happy
yelp
satan
leaped
into
the
street
the
noble
mastiff
hesitated
as
though
this
were
not
quite
regular
he
did
not
belong
to
the
club
and
he
did
know
that
satan
had
ever
been
away
from
home
after
dark
in
his
life
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
wait
for
dinnie
to
call
him
back
as
she
always
did
but
this
time
there
was
no
sound
and
hugo
walked
majestically
on
with
absurd
little
satan
running
in
a
circle
about
him
on
the
way
they
met
the
funeral
dog
who
glanced
inquiringly
at
satan
shied
from
the
mastiff
and
trotted
on
on
the
next
block
the
old
drunkard
yellow
cur
ran
across
the
street
and
after
interchanging
the
compliments
of
the
season
ran
back
after
his
staggering
master
as
they
approached
the
railroad
track
a
strange
dog
joined
them
to
whom
hugo
paid
no
attention
at
the
crossing
another
new
acquaintance
bounded
toward
them
this
one
a
shepherd
was
quite
friendly
and
he
received
satan
advances
with
affable
condescension
then
another
came
and
another
and
little
head
got
quite
confused
they
were
a
lot
of
curs
and
from
the
negro
settlement
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
though
satan
had
little
experience
his
instincts
told
him
that
all
was
not
as
it
should
be
and
had
he
been
human
he
would
have
wondered
very
much
how
they
had
escaped
the
carnage
that
day
uneasy
he
looked
around
for
hugo
but
hugo
had
disappeared
once
or
twice
hugo
had
looked
around
for
satan
and
satan
paying
no
attention
the
mastiff
trotted
on
home
in
disgust
just
then
a
powerful
yellow
cur
sprang
out
of
the
darkness
over
the
railroad
track
and
satan
sprang
to
meet
him
and
so
nearly
had
the
life
scared
out
of
him
by
the
snarl
and
flashing
fangs
of
the
that
he
hardly
had
the
strength
to
shrink
back
behind
his
new
friend
the
shepherd
a
strange
thing
then
happened
the
other
dogs
became
suddenly
quiet
and
every
eye
was
on
the
yellow
cur
he
sniffed
the
air
once
or
twice
gave
two
or
three
peculiar
low
growls
and
all
those
dogs
except
satan
lost
the
civilization
of
centuries
and
went
back
suddenly
to
the
time
when
they
were
wolves
and
were
looking
for
a
leader
the
cur
was
lobo
for
that
little
pack
and
after
a
short
parley
he
lifted
his
nose
high
and
started
away
without
looking
back
while
the
other
dogs
silently
trotted
after
him
with
a
mystified
yelp
satan
ran
after
them
the
cur
did
not
take
the
turnpike
but
jumped
the
fence
into
a
field
making
his
way
by
the
rear
of
houses
from
which
now
and
then
another
dog
would
slink
out
and
silently
join
the
band
every
one
of
them
satan
nosed
most
friendlily
and
to
his
great
joy
the
funeral
dog
on
the
edge
of
the
town
leaped
into
their
midst
ten
minutes
later
the
cur
stopped
in
the
midst
of
some
woods
as
though
he
would
inspect
his
followers
plainly
he
disapproved
of
satan
and
satan
kept
out
of
his
way
then
he
sprang
into
the
turnpike
and
the
band
trotted
down
it
under
flying
black
clouds
and
shifting
bands
of
brilliant
moonlight
once
a
buggy
swept
past
them
a
familiar
odor
struck
satan
nose
and
he
stopped
for
a
moment
to
smell
the
horse
tracks
and
right
he
was
too
for
out
at
her
grandmother
dinnie
refused
to
be
comforted
and
in
that
buggy
was
uncle
billy
going
back
to
town
after
him
snow
was
falling
it
was
a
great
lark
for
satan
once
or
twice
as
he
trotted
along
he
had
to
bark
his
joy
aloud
and
each
time
the
big
cur
gave
him
such
a
fierce
growl
that
he
feared
thereafter
to
open
his
jaws
but
he
was
happy
for
all
that
to
be
running
out
into
the
night
with
such
a
lot
of
funny
friends
and
not
to
know
or
care
where
he
was
going
he
got
pretty
tired
presently
for
over
hill
and
down
hill
they
went
at
that
unceasing
trot
trot
trot
satan
tongue
began
to
hang
out
once
he
stopped
to
rest
but
the
loneliness
frightened
him
and
he
ran
on
after
them
with
his
heart
almost
bursting
he
was
about
to
lie
right
down
and
die
when
the
cur
stopped
sniffed
the
air
once
or
twice
and
with
those
same
low
growls
led
the
marauders
through
a
rail
fence
into
the
woods
and
lay
quietly
down
how
satan
loved
that
soft
thick
grass
all
snowy
that
it
was
it
was
almost
as
good
as
his
own
bed
at
home
and
there
they
lay
how
long
satan
never
knew
for
he
went
to
sleep
and
dreamed
that
he
was
after
a
rat
in
the
barn
at
home
and
he
yelped
in
his
sleep
which
made
the
cur
lift
his
big
yellow
head
and
show
his
fangs
the
moving
of
the
shepherd
and
the
funeral
dog
waked
him
at
last
and
satan
got
up
half
crouching
the
cur
was
leading
the
way
toward
the
dark
still
woods
on
top
of
the
hill
over
which
the
star
of
bethlehem
was
lowly
sinking
and
under
which
lay
a
flock
of
the
gentle
creatures
that
seemed
to
have
been
almost
sacred
to
the
lord
of
that
star
they
were
in
sore
need
of
a
watchful
shepherd
now
satan
was
stiff
and
chilled
but
he
was
rested
and
had
had
his
sleep
and
he
was
just
as
ready
for
fun
as
he
always
was
he
understand
that
sneaking
why
they
did
all
jump
and
race
and
bark
as
he
wanted
to
he
could
see
but
he
was
too
polite
to
do
otherwise
than
as
they
did
and
so
he
sneaked
after
them
and
one
would
have
thought
he
knew
as
well
as
the
rest
the
hellish
mission
on
which
they
were
bent
out
of
the
woods
they
went
across
a
little
branch
and
there
the
big
cur
lay
flat
again
in
the
grass
a
faint
bleat
came
from
the
beyond
where
satan
could
see
another
woods
and
then
another
bleat
and
another
and
the
cur
began
to
creep
again
like
a
snake
in
the
grass
and
the
others
crept
too
and
little
satan
crept
though
it
was
all
a
sad
mystery
to
him
again
the
cur
lay
still
but
only
long
enough
for
satan
to
see
curious
fat
white
shapes
above
him
and
then
with
a
growl
the
big
brute
dashed
forward
oh
there
was
fun
in
them
after
all
satan
barked
joyfully
those
were
some
new
playmates
those
fat
white
hairy
things
up
there
and
satan
was
amazed
when
with
frightened
snorts
they
fled
in
every
direction
but
this
was
a
new
game
perhaps
of
which
he
knew
nothing
and
as
did
the
rest
so
did
satan
he
picked
out
one
of
the
white
things
and
fled
barking
after
it
it
was
a
little
fellow
that
he
was
after
but
little
as
he
was
satan
might
never
have
caught
up
had
not
the
sheep
got
tangled
in
some
brush
satan
danced
about
him
in
mad
glee
giving
him
a
playful
nip
at
his
wool
and
springing
back
to
give
him
another
nip
and
then
away
again
plainly
he
was
not
going
to
bite
back
and
when
the
sheep
struggled
itself
tired
and
sank
down
in
a
heap
satan
came
close
and
licked
him
and
as
he
was
very
warm
and
woolly
he
lay
down
and
snuggled
up
against
him
for
awhile
listening
to
the
turmoil
that
was
going
on
around
him
and
as
he
listened
he
got
frightened
if
this
was
a
new
game
it
was
certainly
a
very
peculiar
one
the
wild
rush
the
bleats
of
terror
gasps
of
agony
and
the
fiendish
growls
of
attack
and
the
sounds
of
ravenous
gluttony
with
every
hair
bristling
satan
rose
and
sprang
from
the
woods
and
stopped
with
a
fierce
tingling
of
the
nerves
that
brought
him
horror
and
fascination
one
of
the
white
shapes
lay
still
before
him
there
was
a
great
steaming
red
splotch
on
the
snow
and
a
strange
odor
in
the
air
that
made
him
dizzy
but
only
for
a
moment
another
white
shape
rushed
by
a
tawny
streak
followed
and
then
in
a
patch
of
moonlight
satan
saw
the
yellow
cur
with
his
teeth
fastened
in
the
throat
of
his
moaning
playmate
like
lightning
satan
sprang
at
the
cur
who
tossed
him
ten
feet
away
and
went
back
to
his
awful
work
again
satan
leaped
but
just
then
a
shout
rose
behind
him
and
the
cur
leaped
too
as
though
a
bolt
of
lightning
had
crashed
over
him
and
no
longer
noticing
satan
or
sheep
began
to
quiver
with
fright
and
slink
away
another
shout
rose
from
another
direction
another
from
another
drive
into
the
was
the
cry
now
and
then
there
was
a
fearful
bang
and
a
howl
of
as
some
dog
tried
to
break
through
the
encircling
men
who
yelled
and
cursed
as
they
closed
in
on
the
trembling
brutes
that
slunk
together
and
crept
on
for
it
is
said
every
dog
knows
his
fate
if
caught
and
will
make
little
effort
to
escape
with
them
went
satan
through
the
gate
where
they
huddled
in
a
corner
a
shamed
and
terrified
group
a
tall
overseer
stood
at
the
gate
ten
of
he
said
grimly
he
had
been
on
the
lookout
for
just
such
a
tragedy
for
there
had
recently
been
a
raid
on
several
farms
in
that
neighborhood
and
for
several
nights
he
had
had
a
lantern
hung
out
on
the
edge
of
the
woods
to
scare
the
dogs
away
but
a
drunken
had
neglected
his
duty
that
christmas
eve
yassuh
an
dey
jus
sebenteen
dead
sheep
out
dar
said
a
negro
look
at
the
little
one
said
a
tall
boy
who
looked
like
the
overseer
and
satan
knew
that
he
spoke
of
him
go
back
to
the
house
son
said
the
overseer
and
tell
your
mother
to
give
you
a
christmas
present
i
got
for
you
yesterday
with
a
glad
whoop
the
boy
dashed
away
and
in
a
moment
dashed
back
with
a
winchester
in
his
hand
the
dark
hour
before
dawn
was
just
breaking
on
christmas
day
it
was
the
hour
when
satan
usually
rushed
upstairs
to
see
if
his
little
mistress
was
asleep
if
he
were
only
at
home
now
and
if
he
only
had
known
how
his
little
mistress
was
weeping
for
him
amid
her
playthings
and
his
two
new
balls
and
a
collar
with
a
silver
plate
on
which
was
his
name
satan
dean
and
if
dinnie
could
have
seen
him
now
her
heart
would
have
broken
for
the
tall
boy
raised
his
gun
there
was
a
jet
of
smoke
a
sharp
clean
crack
and
the
funeral
dog
started
on
the
right
way
at
last
toward
his
dead
master
another
crack
and
the
yellow
cur
leaped
from
the
ground
and
fell
kicking
another
crack
and
another
and
with
each
crack
a
dog
tumbled
until
little
satan
sat
on
his
haunches
amid
the
writhing
pack
alone
his
time
was
now
come
as
the
rifle
was
raised
he
heard
up
at
the
big
house
the
cries
of
children
the
popping
of
tooting
of
horns
and
whistles
and
loud
shouts
of
christmas
gif
christmas
gif
his
little
heart
beat
furiously
perhaps
he
knew
just
what
he
was
doing
perhaps
it
was
the
accident
of
habit
most
likely
satan
simply
wanted
to
go
home
but
when
that
gun
rose
satan
rose
too
on
his
haunches
his
tongue
out
his
black
eyes
steady
and
his
funny
little
paws
hanging
loosely
and
begged
the
boy
lowered
the
gun
down
sir
satan
dropped
obediently
but
when
the
gun
was
lifted
again
satan
rose
again
and
again
he
begged
down
i
tell
you
this
time
satan
would
not
down
but
sat
begging
for
his
life
the
boy
turned
papa
i
ca
shoot
that
dog
perhaps
satan
had
reached
the
stern
old
overseer
heart
perhaps
he
remembered
suddenly
that
it
was
christmas
at
any
rate
he
said
gruffly
well
let
him
go
come
here
sir
satan
bounded
toward
the
tall
boy
frisking
and
trustful
and
begged
again
go
home
sir
satan
needed
no
second
command
without
a
sound
he
fled
out
the
and
as
he
swept
under
the
front
gate
a
little
girl
ran
out
of
the
front
door
of
the
big
house
and
dashed
down
the
steps
shrieking
saty
saty
oh
saty
but
satan
never
heard
on
he
fled
across
the
crisp
fields
leaped
the
fence
and
struck
the
road
for
home
while
dinnie
dropped
sobbing
in
the
snow
hitch
up
a
horse
quick
said
uncle
carey
rushing
after
dinnie
and
taking
her
up
in
his
arms
ten
minutes
later
uncle
carey
and
dinnie
both
warmly
bundled
up
were
after
flying
satan
they
never
caught
him
until
they
reached
the
hill
on
the
outskirts
of
town
where
was
the
kennel
of
the
people
who
were
giving
painless
death
to
satan
kind
and
where
they
saw
him
stop
and
turn
from
the
road
there
was
divine
providence
in
satan
flight
for
one
little
dog
that
christmas
morning
for
uncle
carey
saw
the
old
drunkard
staggering
down
the
road
without
his
little
companion
and
a
moment
later
both
he
and
dinnie
saw
satan
nosing
a
little
yellow
cur
between
the
palings
uncle
carey
knew
the
little
cur
and
while
dinnie
was
shrieking
for
satan
he
was
saying
under
his
breath
well
i
swear
i
swear
i
swear
and
while
the
big
man
who
came
to
the
door
was
putting
satan
into
dinnie
arms
he
said
sharply
who
brought
that
yellow
dog
here
the
man
pointed
to
the
old
drunkard
figure
turning
a
corner
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
i
thought
so
i
thought
so
he
sold
him
to
you
for
for
a
drink
of
whiskey
the
man
whistled
bring
him
out
i
pay
his
license
so
back
went
satan
and
the
little
cur
to
grandmother
dean
and
dinnie
cried
when
uncle
carey
told
her
why
he
was
taking
the
little
cur
along
with
her
own
hands
she
put
satan
old
collar
on
the
little
brute
took
him
to
the
kitchen
and
fed
him
first
of
all
then
she
went
into
the
uncle

said
severely

and
she
turned
to
satan
in
his
shining
new
collar
and
innocent
as
a
cherub
satan
sat
on
the
hearth
begging
for
his
breakfast
