call
dandyfied
as
a
rule
said
the
watchman
who
had
just
had
a
passage
of
arms
with
a
lighterman
and
been
advised
to
let
somebody
else
wash
him
and
make
a
good
job
of
it
got
too
much
sense
they
leave
dressing
up
and
making
eyesores
of
theirselves
to
men
wot
never
smelt
salt
water
men
wot
drift
up
and
down
the
river
in
lighters
and
get
in
everybody
way
he
glanced
fiercely
at
the
retreating
figure
of
the
lighterman
and
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
a
request
for
a
lock
of
his
hair
to
patch
a
favorite
doormat
with
resumed
with
much
vigor

task
of

of

that
a

could
do

and
he
had
a
few
words
with
the
barmaid
on

fancy
to

gentleman
in

bar
wot

ad
drunk
rupert
gave
way
the

on
the
back
and

his
and
the
barmaid
wot
come
back
agin
said
it
was
the
best
thing
he
could
do
with
it
and
she
wondered
he
thought
of
it
afore
they
went
out
separate
as
the
manager
said
it
would
be
better
for
them
not
to
be
seen
together
and
rupert
keeping
about
a
dozen
yards
behind
follered
down
the
mile
end

by
and
by
the

stopped
outside
a
wot
been
boarded
up
and
stuck
all
over
with
savages
dancing
and
killing
white
people
and
hunting
elephants
and
arter
turning
round
and
giving
rupert
a
nod
opened

a
present
from
the
emperor

but
being
a
married
man
he
asked
to
keep
it
quiet
rupert
shook
with
alfredi
and
then
her
led
to
a
room
at
the
back
where
a
little
lame
man
was
cleaning
up
things
and
told
to
take
his
clothes
off
if
they
was
mine
he
ses
squinting
at
the
i
should

laughed
and

and
arter
cutting
his

into
pieces

it
into
the
fireplace
and
pulled
the
dampers
out

burnt
up
boots
and
socks

everything

was
a

a
real
zulu
because
the
manager
said
they
tear
to
pieces
if
they
did
and
eat
arterwards
but
arter
a
time
nervousness
wore
off
and
he
jumped
about
like
a
monkey

gave
performances
every
arf
hour
from
six
to
ten
and
rupert
felt
ready
to
drop

feet

sore
with
dancing
and
his
throat
ached
with
singing
zulu
but
wot
upset
more
than
anything

see
whether

and
they

in
a
whisper
that

at
it
than

then
pinch

in
by
the
end
of
the
week

was
getting
desperate

hated
being
black
for

better
color

did
mind

black
for
out
o
doors

looking
for

and
went
off
with

and
rupert
wishful
to
make
the
best
o
things
decided
that
he
would
undress
george
and
go
off
in
clothes
he
waited
till
kumbo
gone
off
to
bed
and
then
he
started
to
take
george
coat
off
he
got
the
two
top
buttons
undone
all
right
and
then
george
turned
over
in
sleep
it
surprised
rupert
but
wot
surprised
more
when
he
rolled
george
over
was
to
find
them
two
buttons
done
up
agin
arter
it
had
three
times
he
see
it
was
and
he
come
to
the
belief
that
george
was
no
more
drunk
than
wot
he
was
and
that
it
was
all
a
thing
between
and
alfredi
he
went
to
bed
then
to
think
it
over
and
by
the
morning
he
made
up
his
mind
to
keep
quiet
and
bide
his
time
as
the
saying
is
he
spoke
quite
cheerful
to
alfredi
and
pretended
to
believe
when
he
said
that
he
been
to
the
about
the
clothes
two
days
arterwards
he
thought
of
something
he
remembered
me
he
found
a
dirty
old
envelope
on
the
floor
and
with
a
bit
o
lead
pencil
he
wrote
me
a
letter
on
the
back
of
one
o
the
bills
telling
me
all
his
troubles
and
asking
me
to
bring
some
clothes
and
rescue
he
stuck
on
one
of
the
stamps
he
found
in
george
pocket
and
opening
the
door
just
afore
going
to
bed
threw
it
out
on
the
pavement
the
world
is
full
of
officious
interfering
i
should
no
more
think
of
posting
a
letter
that
did
belong
to
me
with
an
unused
stamp
on
it
than
i
should
think
o
flying
but
some
son
of
a
a
gun
posted
that
letter
and
i
got

eleven
with
any
old
clothes
i
could
pick
up
if

did

said

should

the
clock
struck
twelve
and
that
his
ghost
would
sit
on
the
wharf
and
keep
watch
with
me
every
night
for
the
rest
o
my
life
he
said

as
in
life
a
wharf
is
a
lonely
place
of
a
night
especially
our
wharf
which
is
full
of
dark
corners
and
being
a
silly

mile
end

found

place
easy
enough
the
door
was
just
on
the
jar
and
as
i
tapped
on
it
with
my
a
black
man
arf
naked
opened
it
and
said
and
pulled
me
inside
there
was
a
bit
candle
on
the
floor
shaded
by
a
box
and
a
man
fast
asleep
and
snoring
up
in
one
corner
rupert
dressed
like
lightning
and
he
just
put
on
cap
when
the
door
at
the
back
opened
and
a
fat
black
woman
came
out
and
began
to
chatter
rupert
told
her
to
hush
and
she
and
then
he
waved
hand
to
to
say
and
afore
you
could
say
jack
robinson
she
grabbed
up
a
bit
o
dirty
blanket
a
bundle
of
assegais
and
a
spear
and
come
out
arter
us
back
ses
rupert
in
a
whisper
pointing
illustration
back
ses
rupert
in
a
whisper
pointing
kumbo
shook
her
and
then
he
took
hold
of
and
tried
to
shove
back
but
she
would
go
i
lent
him
a
but
all
wimmen
are
the
same
black
or
white
and
afore
i
knew
where
i
was
she
clawed
my
cap
off
and
scratched
me
all
down
one
side
of
the
face
walk
fast
ses
rupert
i
started
to
run
but
it
was
all
no
good
kumbo
kept
up
with
us
easy
and
she
was
so
pleased
at
being
out
in
the
open
air
that
she
began
to
dance
and
play
about
like
a
kitten
instead
o
minding
their
own
business
people
turned
and
follered
us
and
quite
a
crowd
collected
we
shall
the
police
in
a
minute
ses
rupert
come
in
quick
he
pointed
to
a
pub
up
a
side
street
and
went
in
with
kumbo
holding
on
to
his
arm
the
barman
was
for
sending
us
out
at
fust
but
such
a
crowd
follered
us
in
that
he
altered
mind
i
ordered
three
pints
and
while
i
was
rupert
his
kumbo
finished
and
began
on
mine
i
tried
to
explain
but
she
held
on
to
it
like
grim
death
and
in
the
confusion
rupert
slipped
out
he
been
gone
five
seconds
afore
she
missed
and
i
never
see
anybody
so
upset
in
all
my
life
she
spilt
the
beer
all
down
the
place
where
bodice
ought
to
ha
been
and
then
she
dropped
the
pot
and
went
arter
like
a
hare
i
follered
in
a
different
way
and
when
i
got
round
the
corner
i
found
she
caught
and
was
holding
by
the
arm
o
course
the
crowd
was
round
us
agin
and
to
get
rid
of
i
did
a
thing
i
seldom
done
afore
i
called
a
cab
and
we
all
bundled
in
and
drove
off
to
the
wharf
with
the
spear
sticking
out
o
the
window
and
most
of
the
assegais
sticking
into
me
this
is
getting
serious
ses
rupert
yes
i
ses
and
wot
i
done
to
be
dragged
into
it
you
must
been
paying
some
attention
to
make
carry
on
like
this
i
thought
rupert
would
ha
bust
and
the
things
he
said
to
the
man
wot
was
spending
money
like
water
to
rescue
was
disgraceful
we
got
to
the
wharf
at
last
and
i
was
glad
to
see
that
my
pal
got
tired
of
and
gone
off
leaving
the
gate
open
kumbo
went
in
on
to
rupert
arm
and
i
follered
with
the
spear
which
i
held
in
my
while
i
paid
the
cabman
they
went
into
the
office
and
rupert
and
me
talked
it
over
while
kumbo
kept
patting
cheek
he
was
afraid
that
the
manager
would
track
to
the
wharf
and
i
was
afraid
that
the
would
find
out
that
i
been
neglecting
my
dooty
for
the
fust
time
in
my
life
we
talked
all
night
pretty
near
and
then
at
five
arf
an
hour
afore
the
came
on
i
made
up
my
mind
to
fetch
a
cab
and
drive
to
my
i
wanted
rupert
to
go
somewhere
else
but
said
he
got
nowhere
else
to
go
and
it
was
the
only
thing
to
get
off
the
wharf
i
opened
the
gates
at
ten
minutes
to
six
and
just
as
the
fust
man
come
on
and
walked
down
the
wharf
we
slipped
in
and
drove
away
we
was
all
tired
and
yawning
there
something
about
the
motion
of
a
cab
or
an
omnibus
that
always
makes
me
feel
sleepy
and
arter
a
time
i
closed
my
eyes
and
went
off
sound
i
remember
i
was
dreaming
that
i
found
a
bag
o
money
when
the
cab
pulled
up
with
a
jerk
in
front
of
my
and
woke
me
up
opposite
me
sat
kumbo
fast
asleep
and
rupert
disappeared
i
was
dazed
for
a
moment
and
afore
i
could
do
anything
kumbo
woke
up
and
missed
rupert
wot
made
matters
worse
than
anything
was
that
my
missis
was
kneeling
down
in
the
passage
doing
and
face
as
i
got
down
out
o
that
cab
with
kumbo
on
to
my
arm
was
something
too
awful
for
words
it
seemed
to
rise
up
from
near
the
step
and
to
go
on
rising
till
i
thought
it
never
stop
and
every
inch
it
rose
it
got
worse
and
worse
to
look
at
illustration
she
stood
blocking
up
the
doorway
with
her
on
her
she
stood
blocking
up
the
doorway
with
her
on
her
while
i
explained
with
kumbo
still
on
my
arm
and
a
crowd
collecting
behind
and
the
more
i
explained
the
more
i
could
see
she
did
believe
a
word
of
it
she
never
believed
it
i
sent
for
alfredi
to
come
and
take
kumbo
away
and
when
i
spoke
to
about
rupert
he
said
i
was
dreaming
and
asked
me
whether
i
was
ashamed
o
myself
for
carrying
off
a
pore
black
gal
wot
got
no
father
or
mother
to
look
arter
her
he
said
that
afore
my
missis
and
my
character
been
under
a
cloud
ever
since
waiting
for
rupert
to
turn
up
and
clear
it
away
