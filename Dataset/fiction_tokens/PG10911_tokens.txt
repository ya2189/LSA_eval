of

empty

was
never

the
entire
course
of
its
genteel
and
commodious
career
it
had
never
once
been
to
let
go
inside

breathe
its
atmosphere
of
a
bored
house
that
is
generally
empty
yet
never
untenanted
all
its
twelve
rooms
dark
and
forlorn

two
its

atmosphere

principal
the
startling
thing
in
the
illuminated
room
on

was
a
of
the
colour
between
heliotrope
and
purple
known
to
a
previous
generation
as
puce
a
quilted
garment
stuffed
with
swansdown
light
as
hydrogen
nearly
and
warm
as
the
smile
of
a
kind
heart
old
perhaps
possibly
worn
in
its
outlying
regions
and
allowing
fluffs
of
feathery
white
to
escape
through
its
satin
pores
but
a
to
dream
of
it
dominated
the
unkempt
naked
apartment
its
voluptuous
folds
glittering
crudely
under
the
oil
lamp
which
was
set
on
a
on
the
stained
deal
table
the
oil
lamp
had
a
glass
reservoir
a
chipped
chimney
and
a
cardboard
shade
and
had
probably
cost
less
than
a
florin
five
florins
would
have
purchased
the

and
all
the
rest
of
the
furniture
including
the
in

easel

packets
of
cigarettes
and

another

corners

cardboard
shade

a
complicated
system
of
cobwebs
to
match
the
dust
on
the
bare
floor
within
the
there
was
a
man
this
man
had
reached
the
interesting
age
i
mean
the
age
when
you
think
you
have
shed
all
the
illusions
of
infancy
when
you
think
you
understand
life
and
when
you
are
often
occupied
in
speculating
upon
the
delicious
surprises
which
existence
may
hold
for
you
the
age
in
sum
that
is
the
most
romantic
and
tender
of
all
ages
for
a
male
i
mean
the
age
of
fifty
an
age
absurdly
misunderstood
by
all
those
who
have
not
reached
it
a
thrilling
age
appearances
are
tragically
deceptive
the
inhabitant
of
the
puce
had
a
short
greying
beard
and
moustache
his
plenteous
hair
was
passing
from
pepper
into
salt
there
were
many
minute
wrinkles
in
the
hollows
between
his
eyes
and
the
fresh
crimson
of
his
cheeks
and
the
eyes
were
sad
they
were
very
sad
had
he
stood
erect
and
looked
perpendicularly
down
he
would
have
perceived
not
his
slippers
but
a
protuberant
button
of
the
understand
me
i
conceal
nothing
i
admit
the
figures
written
in
the
of
his
tailor
he
was
fifty
yet
like
most
men
of
fifty
he
was
still
very
young
and
like
most
bachelors
of
fifty
he
was
rather
helpless
he
was
quite
sure
that
he
had
not
had
the
best
of
luck
if
he
had
excavated
his
soul
he
would
have
discovered
somewhere
in
its
deeps
a
wistful
appealing
desire
to
be
taken
care
of
to
be
sheltered
from
the
inconveniences
and
harshness
of
the
world
but
he
would
not
have
admitted
the
discovery
a
bachelor
of
fifty
can
not
be
expected
to
admit
that
he
resembles
a
girl
of
nineteen
nevertheless
it
is
a
strange
fact
that
the
resemblance
between
the
heart
of
an
experienced
adventurous
bachelor
of
fifty
and
the
simple
heart
of
a
girl
of
nineteen
is
stronger
than
girls
of
nineteen
imagine
especially
when
the
bachelor
of
fifty
is
sitting
solitary
and
unfriended
at
two
in
the
night
in
the
forlorn
atmosphere
of
a
house
that
has
outlived
its
hopes
bachelors
of
fifty
alone
will
comprehend
me
it
has
never
been
decided
what
young
girls
do
meditate
upon
when
they
meditate
young
girls
themselves
can
not
decide
as
a
rule
the
lonely
fancies
of
bachelors
are
scarcely
less
amenable
to
definition
but
the
case
of
the
inhabitant
of
the
puce
was
an
exception
to
the
rule
he
knew
and
he
could
have
said
precisely
what
he
was
thinking
about
in
that
sad
hour
and
place
his
melancholy
thoughts
were
centred
upon
the
resplendent
unique
success
in
life
of
a
gifted
and
glorious
being
known
to
nations
and
newspapers
as
priam
farll
and
in
the
days
when
the
new
gallery
was
new
a
picture
signed
by
the
unknown
name
of
priam
farll
was
exhibited
there
and
aroused
such
terrific
interest
that
for
several
months
no
conversation
among
cultured
persons
was
regarded
as
complete
without
some
reference
to
it
that
the
artist
was
a
very
great
painter
indeed
was
admitted
by
every
one
the
only
question
which
cultured
persons
felt
it
their
duty
to
settle
was
whether
he
was
the
greatest
painter
that
ever
lived
or
merely
the
greatest
painter
since
velasquez
cultured
persons
might
have
continued
to
discuss
that
nice
point
to
the
present
hour
had
it
not
leaked
out
that
the
picture
had
been
refused
by
the
royal
academy
the
culture
of
london
then
at
once
healed
up
its
strife
and
combined
to
fall
on
the
royal
academy
as
an
institution
which
had
no
right
to
exist
the
affair
even
got
into
parliament
and
occupied
three
minutes
of
the
imperial
legislature
useless
for
the
royal
academy
to
argue
that
it
had
overlooked
the
canvas
for
its
dimensions
were
seven
feet
by
five
it
represented
a
policeman
a
simple
policeman
and
it
was
not
merely
the
most
striking
portrait
imaginable
but
the
first
appearance
of
the
policeman
in
great
art
criminals
one
heard
instinctively
fled
before
it
no
the
royal
academy
really
could
not
argue
that
the
work
had
been
overlooked
and
in
truth
the
royal
academy
did
not
argue
accidental
negligence
it
did
not
argue
about
its
own
right
to
exist
it
did
not
argue
at
all
it
blandly
went
on
existing
and
taking
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
day
in
shillings
at
its
polished
turnstiles
no
details
were
obtainable
concerning
priam
farll
whose
address
was
poste
restante
various
collectors
animated
by
deep
faith
in
their
own
judgment
and
a
sincere
desire
to
encourage
british
art
were
anxious
to
purchase
the
picture
for
a
few
pounds
and
these
enthusiasts
were
astonished
and
pained
to
learn
that
priam
farll
had
marked
a
figure
of
the
price
of
a
rare
postage
stamp
in
consequence
the
picture
was
not
sold
and
after
an
enterprising
journal
had
unsuccessfully
offered
a
reward
for
the
identification
of
the
portrayed
policeman
the
matter
went
gently
to
sleep
while
the
public
employed
its
annual
holiday
as
usual
in
discussing
the
big
gooseberry
of
matrimonial
relations
every
one
naturally
expected
that
in
the
following
year
the
mysterious
priam
farll
would
in
accordance
with
the
universal
rule
for
a
successful
career
in
british
art
contribute
another
portrait
of
another
policeman
to
the
new
gallery
and
so
on
for
about
twenty
years
at
the
end
of
which
period
england
would
have
learnt
to
recognize
him
as
its
favourite
painter
of
policemen
but
priam
farll
contributed
nothing
to
the
new
gallery
he
had
apparently
forgotten
the
new
gallery
which
was
considered
to
be
ungracious
if
not
ungrateful
on
his
part
instead
he
adorned
the
paris
salon
with
a
large
seascape
showing
penguins
in
the
foreground
now
these
penguins
became
the
penguins
of
the
continental
year
they
made
penguins
the
fashionable
bird
in
paris
and
also
twelve
months
later
in
london
the
french
government
offered
to
buy
the
picture
on
behalf
of
the
republic
at
its
customary
price
of
five
hundred
francs
but
priam
farll
sold
it
to
the
american
connoisseur
whitney
whitt
for
five
thousand
dollars
shortly
afterwards
he
sold
the
policeman
whom
he
had
kept
by
him
to
the
same
connoisseur
for
ten
thousand
dollars
whitney
whitt
was
the
expert
who
had
paid
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
a
madonna
and
joseph
with
donor
of
raphael
the
enterprising
journal
before
mentioned
calculated
that
counting
the
space
actually
occupied
on
the
canvas
by
the
policeman
the
daring
connoisseur
had
expended
two
guineas
per
square
inch
on
the
policeman
at
which
stage
the
vast
newspaper
public
suddenly
woke
up
and
demanded
with
one
voice
who
is
this
priam
farll
though
the
query
remained
unanswered
priam
farll
reputation
was
henceforward
absolutely
assured
and
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
omitted
to
comply
with
the
regulations
ordained
by
english
society
for
the
conduct
of
successful
painters
he
ought
first
to
have
taken
the
elementary
precaution
of
being
born
in
the
united
states
he
ought
after
having
refused
all
interviews
for
months
to
have
ultimately
granted
a
special
one
to
a
newspaper
with
the
largest
circulation
he
ought
to
have
returned
to
england
grown
a
mane
and
a
tufted
tail
and
become
the
king
of
beasts
or
at
least
to
have
made
a
speech
at
a
banquet
about
the
noble
and
purifying
mission
of
art
assuredly
he
ought
to
have
painted
the
portrait
of
his
father
or
grandfather
as
an
artisan
to
prove
that
he
was
not
a
snob
but
no
not
content
with
making
each
of
his
pictures
utterly
different
from
all
the
others
he
neglected
all
the
above
formalities
and
yet
managed
to
pile
triumph
on
triumph
there
are
some
men
of
whom
it
may
be
said
that
like
a
punter
on
a
good
day
they
ca
do
wrong
priam
farll
was
one
such
in
a
few
years
he
had
become
a
legend
a
standing
of
a
riddle
no
one
knew
him
no
one
saw
him
no
one
married
him
constantly
abroad
he
was
ever
the
subject
of
conflicting
rumours
parfitts
themselves
his
london
agents
knew
naught
of
him
but
his
handwriting
on
the
backs
of
cheques
in
four
figures
they
sold
an
average
of
five
large
and
five
small
pictures
for
him
every
year
these
pictures
arrived
out
of
the
unknown
and
the
cheques
went
into
the
unknown
young
artists
mute
in
admiration
before
the
masterpieces
from
his
brush
which
enriched
all
the
national
galleries
of
europe
save
of
course
that
in
trafalgar
square
dreamt
of
him
worshipped
him
and
quarrelled
fiercely
about
him
as
the
very
symbol
of
glory
luxury
and
flawless
accomplishment
never
conceiving
him
as
a
man
like
themselves
with
boots
to
lace
up
a
palette
to
clean
a
beating
heart
and
an
instinctive
fear
of
solitude
finally
there
came
to
him
the
paramount
distinction
the
last
proof
that
he
was
appreciated
the
press
actually
fell
into
the
habit
of
mentioning
his
name
without
explanatory
comment
exactly
as
it
does
not
write
balfour
the
eminent
statesman
or
sarah
bernhardt
the
renowned
actress
or
charles
peace
the
historic
murderer
but
simply
balfour
sarah
bernhardt
or
charles
peace
so
it
wrote
simply
priam
farll
and
no
occupant
of
a
smoker
in
a
morning
train
ever
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
to
ask
what
is
the
johnny
greater
honour
in
england
hath
no
man
priam
farll
was
the
first
english
painter
to
enjoy
this
supreme
social
reward
and
now
he
was
inhabiting
the
puce
dreadful
a
bell
startled
the
forlorn
house
its
loud
jangle
came
echoingly
up
the
basement
stairs
and
struck
the
ear
of
priam
farll
who
half
rose
and
then
sat
down
again
he
knew
that
it
was
an
urgent
summons
to
the
front
door
and
that
none
but
he
could
answer
it
and
yet
he
hesitated
leaving
priam
farll
the
great
and
wealthy
artist
we
return
to
that
far
more
interesting
person
priam
farll
the
private
human
creature
and
come
at
once
to
the
dreadful
secret
of
his
character
the
trait
in
him
which
explained
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
his
life
as
a
private
human
creature
he
happened
to
be
shy
he
was
quite
different
from
you
or
me
we
never
feel
secret
qualms
at
the
prospect
of
meeting
strangers
or
of
taking
quarters
at
a
grand
hotel
or
of
entering
a
large
house
for
the
first
time
or
of
walking
across
a
room
full
of
seated
people
or
of
dismissing
a
servant
or
of
arguing
with
a
haughty
female
aristocrat
behind
a
counter
or
of
passing
a
shop
where
we
owe
money
as
for
blushing
or
hanging
back
or
even
looking
awkward
when
faced
with
any
such
simple
everyday
acts
the
idea
of
conduct
so
childish
would
not
occur
to
us
we
behave
naturally
under
all
circumstances
for
why
should
a
sane
man
behave
otherwise
priam
farll
was
different
to
call
the
world
attention
visually
to
the
fact
of
his
own
existence
was
anguish
to
him
but
in
a
letter
he
could
be
absolutely
brazen
give
him
a
pen
and
he
was
fearless
now
he
knew
that
he
would
have
to
go
and
open
the
front
door
both
humanity
and
urged
him
to
go
instantly
for
the
visitant
was
assuredly
the
doctor
come
at
last
to
see
the
sick
man
lying
upstairs
the
sick
man
was
henry
leek
and
henry
leek
was
priam
bad
habit
while
somewhat
of
a
rascal
as
his
master
guessed
leek
was
a
very
perfect
valet
like
you
and
me
he
was
never
shy
he
always
did
the
natural
thing
naturally
he
had
become
little
by
little
indispensable
to
priam
farll
the
sole
means
of
living
communication
between
priam
farll
and
the
universe
of
men
the
master
shyness
resembling
a
deer
kept
the
pair
almost
entirely
out
of
england
and
on
their
continuous
travels
the
servant
invariably
stood
between
that
sensitive
diffidence
and
the
world
leek
saw
every
one
who
had
to
be
seen
and
did
everything
that
involved
personal
contacts
and
being
a
bad
habit
he
had
of
course
grown
on
priam
farll
and
thus
year
after
year
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
farll
shyness
with
his
riches
and
his
glory
had
increased
happily
leek
was
never
that
is
to
say
he
never
had
been
ill
until
this
day
of
their
sudden
incognito
arrival
in
london
for
a
brief
sojourn
he
could
hardly
have
chosen
a
more
inconvenient
moment
for
in
london
of
all
places
in
that
inherited
house
in
selwood
terrace
which
he
so
seldom
used
priam
farll
could
not
carry
on
daily
life
without
him
it
really
was
unpleasant
and
disturbing
in
the
highest
degree
this
illness
of
leek
the
fellow
had
apparently
caught
cold
on
the
he
had
fought
the
approaches
of
insidious
disease
for
several
hours
going
forth
to
make
purchases
and
incidentally
consulting
a
doctor
and
then
without
warning
in
the
very
act
of
making
up
farll
couch
he
had
abandoned
the
struggle
and
since
his
own
bed
was
not
ready
he
had
taken
to
his
master
he
always
did
the
natural
thing
naturally
and
farll
had
been
forced
to
help
him
to
undress
from
this
point
onwards
priam
farll
opulent
though
he
was
and
illustrious
had
sunk
to
a
tragic
impotence
he
could
do
nothing
for
himself
and
he
could
do
nothing
for
leek
because
leek
refused
both
brandy
and
sandwiches
and
the
larder
consisted
solely
of
brandy
and
sandwiches
the
man
lay
upstairs
there
comatose
still
silent
waiting
for
the
doctor
who
had
promised
to
pay
an
evening
visit
and
the
summer
day
had
darkened
into
the
summer
night
the
notion
of
issuing
out
into
the
world
and
personally
obtaining
food
for
himself
or
aid
for
leek
did
genuinely
seem
to
priam
farll
an
impossible
notion
he
had
never
done
such
things
for
him
a
shop
was
an
impregnable
fort
garrisoned
by
ogres
besides
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
and
was
the
torture
of
tortures
so
he
had
wandered
solicitous
and
helpless
up
and
down
the
stairs
until
at
length
leek
ceasing
to
be
a
valet
and
deteriorating
into
a
mere
human
organism
had
feebly
yet
curtly
requested
to
be
just
let
alone
asserting
that
he
was
right
enough
whereupon
the
envied
of
all
painters
the
symbol
of
artistic
glory
and
triumph
had
assumed
the
valet
notorious
puce
and
established
himself
in
a
hard
chair
for
a
night
of
discomfort
the
bell
rang
once
more
and
there
was
a
sharp
impressive
knock
that
reverberated
through
the
forlorn
house
in
a
most
portentous
and
terrifying
manner
it
might
have
been
death
knocking
it
engendered
the
horrible
suspicion
suppose
he
ill
priam
farll
sprang
up
nervously
braced
to
meet
ringers
and
knockers
for
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
dressed
in
frock
coat
and
silk
hat
there
stood
hesitating
a
tall
thin
weary
man
who
had
been
afoot
for
exactly
twenty
hours
in
pursuit
of
his
usual
business
of
curing
imaginary
ailments
by
means
of
medicine
and
suggestion
and
leaving
real
ailments
to
nature
aided
by
coloured
water
his
attitude
towards
the
medical
profession
was
somewhat
sardonic
partly
because
he
was
convinced
that
only
the
gluttony
of
south
kensington
provided
him
with
a
livelihood
but
more
because
his
wife
and
two
daughters
spent
too
much
on
their
frocks
for
years
losing
sight
of
the
fact
that
he
was
an
immortal
soul
they
had
been
treating
him
as
a
machine
they
put
a
breakfast
in
the
slot
pushed
a
button
of
his
waistcoat
and
drew
out
banknotes
for
this
he
had
neither
partner
nor
assistant
nor
carriage
nor
holiday
his
wife
and
daughters
could
not
afford
him
these
luxuries
he
was
able
conscientious
chronically
tired
bald
and
fifty
he
was
also
strange
as
it
may
seem
shy
though
indeed
he
had
grown
used
to
it
as
a
man
gets
used
to
a
hollow
tooth
or
an
eel
to
skinning
no
qualities
of
the
young
girl
heart
about
the
heart
of
cashmore
he
really
did
know
human
nature
and
he
never
dreamt
of
anything
more
paradisaical
than
a
sunday
pullman
escapade
to
brighton
priam
farll
opened
the
door
which
divided
these
two
hesitating
men
and
they
saw
each
other
by
the
light
of
the
gas
lamp
for
the
hall
was
in
darkness
this
mr
farll
asked
cashmore
with
the
unintentional
asperity
of
shyness
as
for
priam
the
revelation
of
his
name
by
leek
shocked
him
almost
into
a
sweat
surely
the
number
of
the
house
should
have
sufficed
yes
he
admitted
half
shy
and
half
vexed
are
you
the
doctor
yes
cashmore
stepped
into
the
obscurity
of
the
hall
how
the
invalid
going
on
i
can
scarcely
tell
you
said
priam
he
in
bed
very
quiet
that
right
said
the
doctor
when
he
came
to
my
surgery
this
morning
i
advised
him
to
go
to
bed
then
followed
a
brief
awkward
pause
during
which
priam
farll
coughed
and
the
doctor
rubbed
his
hands
and
hummed
a
fragment
of
melody
by
jove
the
thought
flashed
through
the
mind
of
farll
this
shy
i
do
believe
and
through
the
mind
of
the
doctor
here
another
of
all
nerves
they
both
instantly
from
sheer
condescension
the
one
to
the
other
became
at
ease
it
was
as
if
a
spring
had
been
loosed
priam
shut
the
door
and
shut
out
the
ray
of
the
street
lamp
i
afraid
there
no
light
here
said
he
i
strike
a
match
said
the
doctor
thanks
very
much
said
priam
the
flare
of
a
wax
vesta
illumined
the
splendours
of
the
puce
but
cashmore
did
not
blench
he
could
flatter
himself
that
in
the
matter
of
he
had
nothing
to
learn
by
the
way
what
wrong
with
him
do
you
think
priam
farll
inquired
in
his
most
boyish
voice
do
know
chill
he
had
a
loud
cardiac
murmur
might
be
anything
that
why
i
said
i
call
anyhow
could
come
any
sooner
been
on
my
feet
since
six
this
morning
you
know
what
it
is
day
he
smiled
grimly
in
his
fatigue
it
very
good
of
you
to
come
said
priam
farll
with
warm
vivacious
sympathy
he
had
an
astonishing
gift
for
imaginatively
putting
himself
in
the
place
of
other
people
not
at
all
the
doctor
muttered
he
was
quite
touched
to
hide
the
fact
that
he
was
touched
he
struck
a
second
match
shall
we
go
upstairs
in
the
bedroom
a
candle
was
burning
on
a
dusty
and
empty
cashmore
moved
it
to
the
vicinity
of
the
bed
which
was
like
an
oasis
of
decent
arrangement
in
the
desert
of
comfortless
chamber
then
he
stooped
to
examine
the
sick
valet
he
shivering
exclaimed
the
doctor
softly
henry
leek
skin
was
indeed
bluish
though
besides
blankets
there
was
a
considerable
apparatus
of
rugs
on
the
bed
and
the
night
was
warm
his
ageing
face
for
he
was
the
third
man
of
fifty
in
that
room
had
an
anxious
look
but
he
made
no
movement
uttered
no
word
at
sight
of
the
doctor
just
stared
dully
his
own
difficult
breathing
alone
seemed
to
interest
him
any
women
up
the
doctor
turned
suddenly
and
fiercely
on
priam
farll
who
started
there
only
ourselves
in
the
house
he
replied
a
person
less
experienced
than
cashmore
in
the
secret
strangenesses
of
genteel
life
in
london
might
have
been
astonished
by
this
information
but
cashmore
no
more
blenched
now
than
he
had
blenched
at
the
puce
garment
well
hurry
up
and
get
some
hot
water
said
he
in
a
tone
dictatorial
and
savage
quick
now
and
brandy
and
more
blankets
now
do
stand
there
please
here
i
go
with
you
to
the
kitchen
show
me
he
snatched
up
the
candle
and
the
expression
of
his
features
said
i
can
see
you
no
good
in
a
crisis
it
all
up
with
me
doctor
came
a
faint
whisper
from
the
bed
so
it
is
my
boy
said
the
doctor
under
his
breath
as
he
tumbled
downstairs
in
the
wake
of
priam
farll
unless
i
get
something
hot
into
you
and
will
there
have
to
be
an
inquest
priam
farll
asked
at
he
had
collapsed
in
the
hard
chair
on
the
the
indispensable
henry
leek
was
lost
to
him
for
ever
he
could
not
imagine
what
would
happen
to
his
existence
in
the
future
he
could
not
conceive
himself
without
leek
and
still
worse
the
immediate
prospect
of
unknown
horrors
of
publicity
in
connection
with
the
death
of
leek
overwhelmed
him
no
said
the
doctor
cheerfully
oh
no
i
was
present
acute
double
pneumonia
sometimes
happens
like
that
i
can
give
a
certificate
but
of
course
you
will
have
to
go
to
the
registrar
and
register
the
death
even
without
an
inquest
he
saw
that
the
affair
would
be
unthinkably
distressing
he
felt
that
it
would
kill
him
and
he
put
his
hand
to
his
face
where
are
farll
relatives
to
be
found
the
doctor
asked
farll
relatives
priam
farll
repeated
without
comprehending
then
he
understood
cashmore
thought
that
henry
leek
name
was
farll
and
all
the
sensitive
timidity
in
priam
farll
character
seized
swiftly
at
the
mad
chance
of
escape
from
any
kind
of
public
appearance
as
priam
farll
why
should
he
not
let
it
be
supposed
that
he
and
not
henry
leek
had
expired
suddenly
in
selwood
terrace
at
he
would
be
free
utterly
free
yes
said
the
doctor
they
must
be
informed
naturally
priam
mind
ran
rapidly
over
the
catalogue
of
his
family
he
could
think
of
no
one
nearer
than
a
certain
duncan
farll
a
second
cousin
i
do
think
he
had
any
he
replied
in
a
voice
that
trembled
with
excitement
at
the
capricious
rashness
of
what
he
was
doing
perhaps
there
were
distant
cousins
but
farll
never
talked
of
them
which
was
true
he
could
scarcely
articulate
the
words
farll
but
when
they
were
out
of
his
mouth
he
felt
that
the
deed
was
somehow
definitely
done
the
doctor
gazed
at
priam
hands
the
rough
coarsened
hands
of
a
painter
who
is
always
messing
in
oils
and
dust
pardon
me
said
the
doctor
i
presume
you
are
his
valet
or
yes
said
priam
farll
that
set
the
seal
what
was
your
master
full
name
the
doctor
demanded
and
priam
farll
shivered
priam
farll
said
he
weakly
not
loudly
exclaimed
the
doctor
whom
the
hazards
of
life
in
london
had
at
last
staggered
priam
nodded
well
well
the
doctor
gave
vent
to
his
feelings
the
truth
was
that
this
particular
hazard
of
life
in
london
pleased
him
flattered
him
made
him
feel
important
in
the
world
and
caused
him
to
forget
his
fatigue
and
his
wrongs
he
saw
that
the
puce
contained
a
man
who
was
at
the
end
of
his
tether
and
with
that
good
nature
of
his
which
no
hardships
had
been
able
to
destroy
he
offered
to
attend
to
the
preliminary
formalities
then
he
went
month
priam
farll
had
no
intention
of
falling
asleep
his
desire
was
to
consider
the
position
which
he
had
so
rashly
created
for
himself
but
he
did
fall
asleep
and
in
the
hard
chair
he
was
awakened
by
a
tremendous
clatter
as
if
the
house
was
being
bombarded
and
there
were
bricks
falling
about
his
ears
when
he
regained
all
his
senses
this
bombardment
resolved
itself
into
nothing
but
a
loud
and
continued
assault
on
the
front
door
he
rose
and
saw
a
frowsy
dishevelled
figure
in
the
dirty
mirror
over
the
fireplace
and
then
with
stiff
limbs
he
directed
his
sleepy
feet
towards
the
door
cashmore
was
at
the
door
and
still
another
man
of
fifty
a
stoutish
person
in
deep
and
perfect
mourning
including
black
gloves
this
person
gazed
coldly
at
priam
farll
ah
ejaculated
the
mourner
and
stepped
in
followed
by
cashmore
in
achieving
the
inner
mat
the
mourner
perceived
a
white
square
on
the
floor
he
picked
it
up
and
carefully
examined
it
and
then
handed
it
to
priam
farll
i
suppose
this
is
for
you
said
he
priam
accepting
the
envelope
saw
that
it
was
addressed
to
henry
leek
selwood
terrace
in
a
woman
hand
it
for
you
is
it
pursued
the
mourner
in
an
inflexible
voice
yes
said
priam
i
am
duncan
farll
a
solicitor
a
cousin
of
your
late
employer
the
metallic
voice
continued
coming
through
a
set
of
large
fine
white
teeth
what
arrangements
have
you
made
during
the
day
priam
stammered
none
i
been
asleep
you
are
very
respectful
said
duncan
farll
so
this
was
his
second
cousin
whom
he
had
met
once
only
as
a
boy
never
would
he
have
recognized
duncan
evidently
it
did
not
occur
to
duncan
to
recognize
him
people
are
apt
to
grow
unrecognizable
in
the
course
of
forty
years
duncan
farll
strode
about
the
of
the
house
and
on
the
threshold
of
each
room
ejaculated
ah
or
ha
then
he
and
the
doctor
went
upstairs
priam
remained
inert
and
excessively
disturbed
in
the
hall
at
length
duncan
farll
descended
come
in
here
leek
said
duncan
and
priam
meekly
stepped
after
him
into
the
room
where
the
hard
chair
was
duncan
farll
took
the
hard
chair
what
are
your
wages
priam
sought
to
remember
how
much
he
had
paid
henry
leek
a
hundred
a
year
said
he
ah
a
good
wage
when
were
you
last
paid
priam
remembered
that
he
had
paid
leek
two
days
ago
the
day
before
yesterday
said
he
i
must
say
again
you
are
not
very
respectful
duncan
observed
drawing
forth
his
however
here
is
a
month
wages
in
lieu
of
notice
put
your
things
together
and
go
i
shall
have
no
further
use
for
you
i
will
make
no
observations
of
any
kind
but
be
good
enough
to
it
is
three
and
leave
the
house
at
once
let
me
see
your
box
or
boxes
before
you
go
when
an
hour
later
in
the
gloaming
priam
farll
stood
on
the
wrong
side
of
his
own
door
with
henry
leek
heavy
and
henry
tin
trunk
flanking
him
on
either
hand
he
saw
that
events
in
his
career
were
moving
with
immense
rapidity
he
had
wanted
to
be
free
and
free
he
was
quite
free
but
it
appeared
to
him
very
remarkable
that
so
much
could
happen
in
so
short
a
time
as
the
result
of
a
mere
momentary
impulsive
prevarication
chapter

sticking
out
of
the
pocket
of
leek
light
overcoat
was
a
folded
copy
of
the
priam
farll
was
something
of
a
dandy
and
like
all
dandies
and
all
tailors
he
objected
to
the
suave
line
of
a
garment
being
spoilt
by
a
free
utilization
of
pockets
the
overcoat
itself
and
the
suit
beneath
were
quite
good
for
though
they
were
the
property
of
the
late
henry
leek
they
perfectly
fitted
priam
farll
and
had
recently
belonged
to
him
leek
having
been
accustomed
to
clothe
himself
entirely
from
his
master
wardrobe
the
dandy
absently
drew
forth
the
and
the

that
caught

western

at
that
moment
a
hansom
cab
came
ambling
down
selwood
terrace
impulsively
he
hailed
it
said
the
cabman
seeing
with
an
expert
eye
that
priam
farll
was
unaccustomed
to
the
manipulation
of
luggage
give
this
hackenschmidt
a
copper
to
lend
ye
a
hand
you
only
a
light
weight
a
small
and
emaciated
boy
with
the
historic
remains
of
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
sprang
like
a
monkey
up
the
steps
and
not
waiting
to
be
asked
snatched
the
trunk
from
priam
hands
priam
gave
him
one
of
leek
sixpences
for
his
feats
of
strength
and
the
boy
spat
generously
on
the
coin
at
the
same
time
by
a
strange
skill
clinging
to
the
cigarette
with
his
lower
lip
then
the
driver
lifted
the
reins
with
a
noble
gesture
and
priam
had
to
be
decisive
and
get
into
the
cab
queen
gate
said
he
as
keeping
his
head
to
one
side
to
avoid
the
reins
he
gave
the
direction
across
the
roof
of
the
cab
to
the
attentive
cocked
ear
of
the
cabman
he
felt
suddenly
that
he
had
regained
his
nationality
that
he
was
utterly
english
in
an
atmosphere
utterly
english
the
hansom
was
like
home
after
the
wilderness
he
had
chosen
queen
gate
because
it
appeared
the
abode
of
tranquillity
and
discretion
he
felt
that
he
might
sink
into
gate
as
into
a
feather
bed
the
other
palace
intimidated
him
it
recalled
the
terrors
of
a
continental
hotel
in
his
wanderings
he
had
suffered
much
from
the
young
cheerful
and
musical
society
of
bright
hotels
and
bridge
small
had
no
attraction
for
him
as
the
cab
tinkled
through
canyons
of
familiar
stucco
he
looked
further
at
the
he
was
rather
surprised
to
find
more
than
a
column
of
enticing
palaces
each
in
the
finest
position
in
london
london
in
fact
seemed
to
be
one
unique
glorious
position
and
it
was
so
welcome
so
receptive
so
wishful
to
make
a
speciality
of
your
comfort
your
food
your
bath
your
sanitation
he
remembered
the
old
of
the
eighties
now
all
was
changed
for
the
better
the
was
full
of
the
better
crammed
and
packed
with
tight
columns
of
it
the
better
burst
aspiringly
from
the
tops
of
columns
on
the
first
page
and
outsoared
the
very
title
of
the
paper
he
saw
there
for
instance
to
the
left
of
the
title
a
new
refined
in
piccadilly
circus
owned
and
managed
by
gentlewomen
where
you
had
real
tea
and
real
butter
and
real
cakes
in
a
real
it
was
astounding
the
cab
stopped
is
this
it
he
asked
the
driver
this
is
sir
and
it
was
but
it
did
not
resemble
even
a
private
hotel
it
exactly
resembled
a
private
house
narrow
and
tall
and
squeezed
in
between
its
sister
and
its
brother
priam
farll
was
puzzled
till
the
solution
occurred
to
him
of
course
he
said
to
himself
this
is
the
quietude
the
discretion
i
shall
like
this
he
jumped
down
i
keep
you
he
threw
to
the
cabman
in
the
proper
phrase
which
he
was
proud
to
recall
from
his
youth
as
though
the
cabman
had
been
something
which
he
had
ordered
on
approval
there
were
two
he
pulled
one
and
waited
for
the
portals
to
open
on
discreet
vistas
of
luxurious
furniture
no
response
just
as
he
was
consulting
the
to
make
sure
of
the
number
the
door
silently
swung
back
and
disclosed
the
figure
of
a
woman
in
black
silk
who
regarded
him
with
a
stern
astonishment
is
this
he
began
nervous
and
abashed
by
her
formidable
stare
were
you
wanting
rooms
she
asked
yes
said
he
i
was
if
i
could
just
see
will
you
come
in
she
said
and
her
morose
face
under
stringent
commands
from
her
brain
began
an
imitation
of
a
smile
which
as
an
imitation
was
wonderful
it
made
you
wonder
how
she
had
ever
taught
her
face
to
do
it
priam
farll
found
himself
blushing
on
a
turkey
carpet
and
a
sort
of
cathedral
gloom
around
him
he
was
disconcerted
but
the
turkey
carpet
assured
him
somewhat
as
his
eyes
grew
habituated
to
the
light
he
saw
that
the
cathedral
was
very
narrow
and
that
instead
of
the
choir
was
a
staircase
also
clothed
in
turkey
carpet
on
the
lowest
step
reposed
an
object
whose
nature
he
could
not
at
first
determine
would
it
be
for
long
the
lips
opposite
him
muttered
cautiously
his
reply
the
reply
of
an
impulsive
shy
nature
was
to
rush
out
of
the
palace
he
had
identified
the
object
on
the
stairs
it
was
a
with
a
wrung
cloth
on
its
head
he
felt
profoundly
discouraged
and
pessimistic
all
his
energy
had
left
him
london
had
become
hard
hostile
cruel
impossible
he
longed
for
leek
with
a
great
longing
an
hour
later
having
at
the
kind
suggestion
of
the
cabman
deposited
leek
goods
at
the
of
south
kensington
station
he
was
wandering
on
foot
out
of
old
london
into
the
central
ring
of
new
london
where
people
never
do
anything
except
take
the
air
in
parks
lounge
in
roll
to
and
fro
in
peculiar
vehicles
that
have
ventured
out
without
horses
and
are
making
the
best
of
it
buy
flowers
and
egyptian
cigarettes
look
at
pictures
and
eat
and
drink
nearly
all
the
buildings
were
higher
than
they
used
to
be
and
the
street
wider
and
at
intervals
of
a
hundred
yards
or
so
cranes
that
rent
the
clouds
and
defied
the
law
of
gravity
were
continually
swinging
bricks
and
marble
into
the
upper
layers
of
the
air
violets
were
on
sale
at
every
corner
and
the
atmosphere
was
impregnated
with
an
intoxicating
perfume
of
methylated
spirits
presently
he
arrived
at
an
immense
arched
façade
bearing
principally
the
legend
and
he
saw
within
hundreds
of
persons
sipping
tea
and
next
to
that
was
another
arched
façade
bearing
principally
the
word
and
he
saw
within
more
hundreds
sipping
tea
and
then
another
and
then
another
and
then
suddenly
he
came
to
an
open
circular
place
that
seemed
vaguely
familiar
by
jove
he
said
this
is
piccadilly
circus
and
just
at
that
moment
over
a
narrow
doorway
he
perceived
the
image
of
a
green
tree
and
the
words
elm
tree
it
was
the
entrance
to
the
elm
tree
tea
rooms
so
well
spoken
of
in
the
in
certain
ways
he
was
a
man
of
advanced
and
humane
ideas
and
the
thought
of
delicately
nurtured
needy
gentlewomen
bravely
battling
with
the
world
instead
of
starving
as
they
used
to
starve
in
the
past
appealed
to
his
chivalry
he
determined
to
assist
them
by
taking
tea
in
the
advertised
gathering
together
his
courage
he
penetrated
into
a
corridor
lighted
by
pink
electricity
and
then
up
pink
stairs
a
pink
door
stopped
him
at
last
it
might
have
hid
mysterious
and
questionable
things
but
it
said
laconically
and
he
courageously
pushed
he
was
in
a
kind
of
boudoir
thickly
populated
with
tables
and
chairs
the
swift
transmigration
from
the
blatant
street
to
a
had
a
startling
effect
on
him
it
caused
him
to
whip
off
his
hat
as
though
his
hat
had
been
red
hot
except
for
two
tall
elegant
creatures
who
stood
together
at
the
other
end
of
the
boudoir
the
chairs
and
tables
had
the
place
to
themselves
he
was
about
to
stammer
an
excuse
and
fly
when
one
of
the
gentlewomen
turned
her
eye
on
him
for
a
moment
and
so
he
sat
down
the
gentlewomen
then
resumed
their
conversation
he
glanced
cautiously
about
him
firmly
rooted
in
a
border
of
indian
matting
grew
round
all
the
walls
in
exotic
profusion
and
their
topmost
branches
splashed
over
on
to
the
ceiling
a
card
on
the
trunk
of
a
tree
announcing
curtly
dogs
not
allowed
seemed
to
enhearten
him
after
a
pause
one
of
the
gentlewomen
swam
haughtily
towards
him
and
looked
him
between
the
eyes
she
spoke
no
word
but
her
firm
austere
glance
said
now
out
with
it
and
see
you
behave
yourself
he
had
been
ready
to
smile
chivalrously
but
the
smile
was
put
to
sudden
death
some
tea
please
he
said
faintly
and
his
intimidated
tone
said
if
it
is
troubling
you
too
much
what
do
you
want
with
it
asked
the
gentlewoman
abruptly
and
as
he
was
plainly
at
a
loss
she
added
crumpets
or
he
replied
though
he
hated
but
he
was
afraid
you
escaped
this
time
said
the
drapery
of
her
muslins
as
she
swam
from
his
sight
but
no
nonsense
while
i
away
when
she
sternly
and
mutely
thrust
the
refection
before
him
he
found
that
everything
on
the
table
except
the
and
the
spoon
was
growing
after
one
cup
and
one
slice
when
the
tea
had
become
stewed
and
undrinkable
and
the
a
material
suitable
for
the
manufacture
of
shooting
boots
he
resumed
at
any
rate
partially
his
presence
of
mind
and
remembered
that
he
had
done
nothing
positively
criminal
in
entering
the
boudoir
or
and
requesting
food
in
return
for
money
besides
the
gentlewomen
were
now
pretending
to
each
other
that
he
did
not
exist
and
no
other
rash
persons
had
been
driven
by
hunger
into
the
virgin
forest
of
he
began
to
meditate
and
his
meditations
taking
for
him
an
unusual
turn
caused
him
surreptitiously
to
examine
henry
leek
previously
only
known
to
him
by
sight
he
had
not
for
many
years
troubled
himself
concerning
money
but
the
discovery
that
when
he
had
paid
for
the
deposit
of
luggage
at
the
a
solitary
sovereign
rested
in
the
pocket
of
leek
trousers
had
suggested
to
him
that
it
would
be
advisable
sooner
or
later
to
consider
the
financial
aspect
of
existence
there
were
two
banknotes
for
ten
pounds
each
in
leek
also
five
french
banknotes
of
a
thousand
francs
each
and
a
number
of
italian
banknotes
of
small
denominations
the
equivalent
of
two
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
altogether
not
counting
a
folded
some
postage
stamps
and
a
photograph
of
a
woman
of
forty
or
so
this
sum
seemed
neither
vast
nor
insignificant
to
priam
farll
it
seemed
to
him
merely
a
tangible
something
which
would
enable
him
to
banish
the
fiscal
question
from
his
mind
for
an
indefinite
period
he
scarcely
even
troubled
to
wonder
what
leek
was
doing
with
over
two
years
of
income
in
his
he
knew
or
at
least
he
with
certainty
guessed
that
leek
had
been
a
rascal
still
he
had
had
a
sort
of
grim
cynical
affection
for
leek
and
the
thought
that
leek
would
never
again
shave
him
nor
tell
him
in
accents
that
brooked
no
delay
that
his
hair
must
be
cut
nor
register
his
luggage
and
secure
his
seat
on
expresses
filled
him
with
very
real
melancholy
he
did
not
feel
sorry
for
leek
nor
say
to
himself
poor
leek
nobody
who
had
had
the
advantage
of
leek
acquaintance
would
have
said
poor
leek
for
leek
greatest
speciality
had
always
been
the
speciality
of
looking
after
leek
and
wherever
leek
might
be
it
was
a
surety
that
interests
would
not
suffer
therefore
priam
farll
pity
was
mainly
and
though
his
dignity
had
been
considerably
damaged
during
the
final
moments
at
selwood
terrace
there
was
matter
for
congratulation
the
doctor
for
instance
had
shaken
hands
with
him
at
parting
had
shaken
hands
openly
in
the
presence
of
duncan
farll
a
flattering
tribute
to
his
personality
but
the
chief
of
priam
farll
satisfactions
in
that
desolate
hour
was
that
he
had
suppressed
himself
that
for
the
world
he
existed
no
more
i
shall
admit
frankly
that
this
satisfaction
nearly
outweighed
his
grief
he
sighed
and
it
was
a
sigh
of
tremendous
relief
for
now
by
a
miracle
he
would
be
free
from
the
menace
of
lady
sophia
entwistle
looking
back
in
calmness
at
the
still
recent
entwistle
episode
in
paris
the
real
originating
cause
of
his
sudden
flight
to
london
he
was
staggered
by
his
latent
capacity
for
downright
impulsive
foolishness
like
all
shy
people
he
had
fits
of
amazing
audacity
and
his
recklessness
usually
took
the
form
of
making
himself
agreeable
to
women
whom
he
encountered
in
travel
he
was
much
less
shy
with
women
than
with
men
but
to
propose
marriage
to
a
haunter
of
hotels
like
lady
sophia
entwistle
and
to
reveal
his
identity
to
her
and
to
allow
her
to
accept
his
proposal
the
thing
had
been
unimaginably
inept
and
now
he
was
free
for
he
was
dead
he
was
conscious
of
a
chill
in
the
spine
as
he
dwelt
on
the
awful
fate
which
he
had
escaped
he
a
man
of
fifty
a
man
of
set
habits
a
man
habituated
to
the
liberty
of
the
wild
stag
to
bow
his
proud
neck
under
the
solid
footwear
of
lady
sophia
entwistle
yes
there
was
most
decidedly
a
silver
lining
to
the
dark
cloud
of
leek
translation
to
another
sphere
of
activity
in
replacing
the
his
hand
encountered
the
letter
which
had
arrived
for
leek
in
the
morning
arguing
with
himself
whether
he
ought
to
open
it
he
opened
it
it
ran
dear
leek
i
am
so
glad
to
have
your
letter
and
i
think
the
photograph
is
most
gentlemanly
but
i
do
wish
you
would
not
write
with
a
typewriter
you
do
know
how
this
affects
a
woman
or
you
would
do
it
however
i
shall
be
so
glad
to
meet
you
now
as
you
suggest
suppose
we
go
to
maskelyne
and
together
afternoon
saturday
you
know
it
is
the
egyptian
hall
any
more
it
is
in
george
hall
i
think
but
you
will
see
it
in
the
also
the
time
i
will
be
there
when
the
doors
open
you
will
recognize
me
from
my
photograph
but
i
shall
wear
red
roses
in
my
hat
so
for
the
present
yours
sincerely
alice
challice
there
are
always
a
lot
of
dark
parts
at
maskelyne
and
cook
i
must
ask
you
to
behave
as
a
gentleman
should
excuse
me
i
merely
mention
it
in
a
infamous
leek
here
was
at
any
rate
one
explanation
of
a
mysterious
little
typewriter
which
the
valet
had
always
carried
but
which
priam
had
left
at
selwood
terrace
priam
glanced
at
the
photograph
in
the
and
also
strange
to
say
at
the
a
lady
with
three
children
burst
into
the
and
instantly
occupied
the
whole
of
it
the
children
cried
mathaw
mathah
mathaw
in
shrill
tones
of
varied
joy
as
one
of
the
gentlewomen
passed
near
him
he
asked
modestly
how
much
please
she
dropped
a
flake
of
paper
on
to
his
table
without
arresting
her
course
and
said
warningly
you
pay
at
the
desk
when
he
hit
on
the
desk
which
was
hidden
behind
a
screen
of
he
had
to
face
a
true
aristocrat
and
not
in
muslins
either
if
the
others
were
the
daughters
of
earls
this
was
the
authentic
countess
in
a
he
put
down
leek
sovereign
have
you
anything
smaller
snapped
the
countess
i
sorry
i
have
he
replied
she
picked
up
the
sovereign
scornfully
and
turned
it
over
it
very
awkward
she
muttered
then
she
unlocked
two
drawers
and
unwillingly
gave
him
eighteen
and
sixpence
in
silver
and
copper
without
another
word
and
without
looking
at
him
thank
you
said
he
pocketing
it
nervously
and
amid
reiterated
cries
of
mathah
mathaw
mathah
he
hurried
away
unregarded
unregretted
splendidly
repudiated
by
these
delicate
refined
creatures
who
were
struggling
for
a
livelihood
in
a
great
city
i
suppose
you
are
leek
are
you
a
woman
greeted
him
as
he
stood
vaguely
hesitant
outside
george
hall
watching
the
afternoon
audience
emerge
he
started
back
as
though
the
woman
with
her
trace
of
cockney
accent
had
presented
a
revolver
at
his
head
he
was
very
much
afraid
it
may
reasonably
be
asked
what
he
was
doing
up
at
hall
the
answer
to
this
most
natural
question
touches
the
deepest
springs
of
human
conduct
there
were
two
men
in
priam
farll
one
was
the
shy
man
who
had
long
ago
persuaded
himself
that
he
actually
preferred
not
to
mix
with
his
kind
and
had
made
a
virtue
of
his
cowardice
the
other
was
a
doggish
fellow
who
loved
dashing
adventures
and
had
a
perfect
passion
for
free
intercourse
with
the
entire
human
race
no
would
often
lead
no
unsuspectingly
forward
to
a
difficult
situation
from
which
no
though
angry
and
uncomfortable
could
not
retire
thus
it
was
no
who
with
the
most
casual
air
had
wandered
up
regent
street
drawn
by
the
slender
chance
of
meeting
a
woman
with
red
roses
in
her
hat
and
it
was
no
who
had
to
pay
the
penalty
nobody
could
have
been
more
astonished
than
no
at
the
fulfillment
of
no
secret
yearning
for
novelty
but
the
innocent
sincerity
of
no
astonishment
gave
no
aid
to
no
farll
raised
his
hat
and
at
the
same
moment
perceived
the
roses
he
might
have
denied
the
name
of
leek
and
fled
but
he
did
not
though
his
left
leg
was
ready
to
run
his
right
leg
would
not
stir
then
he
was
shaking
hands
with
her
but
how
had
she
identified
him
i
did
really
expect
you
said
the
lady
always
with
a
slight
cockney
accent
but
i
thought
how
silly
it
would
be
for
me
to
miss
the
vanishing
trick
just
because
you
could
come
so
in
i
went
by
myself
why
did
you
expect
me
he
asked
diffidently
well
she
said
farll
being
dead
i
knew
you
have
a
lot
to
do
besides
being
upset
like
oh
yes
he
said
quickly
feeling
that
he
must
be
more
careful
for
he
had
quite
forgotten
that
farll
was
dead
how
did
you
know
how
did
i
know
she
cried
well
i
like
that
look
anywhere
it
all
over
london
has
been
these
six
hours
she
pointed
to
a
ragged
man
who
was
wearing
an
placard
by
way
of
apron
on
the
placard
was
printed
in
large
black
letters
sudden
death
of
priam
farll
in
london
special
memoir
other
ragged
men
also
wearing
aprons
but
of
different
colours
similarly
proclaimed
by
their
attire
that
priam
farll
was
dead
and
people
crowding
out
of
george
hall
were
continually
buying
newspapers
from
these
middlemen
of
tidings
he
blushed
it
was
singular
that
he
could
have
walked
even
in
central
london
without
noticing
that
his
own
name
flew
in
the
summer
breeze
of
every
street
but
so
it
had
been
he
was
that
sort
of
man
now
he
understood
how
duncan
farll
had
descended
upon
selwood
terrace
you
do
mean
to
say
you
did
those
posters
she
demanded
i
did
he
said
simply
that
shows
how
you
must
have
been
thinking
said
she
was
he
a
good
master
yes
very
good
said
priam
farll
with
conviction
i
see
you
not
in
mourning
no
that
is
i
do
hold
with
mourning
myself
she
proceeded
they
say
it
to
show
respect
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
ca
show
your
respect
without
a
pair
of
black
gloves
that
the
dye
always
coming
off
i
do
know
what
you
think
but
i
never
did
hold
with
mourning
grumbling
against
providence
too
not
but
what
i
think
there
a
good
deal
too
much
talk
about
providence
i
do
know
what
you
think
but
i
quite
agree
with
you
he
said
with
a
warm
generous
smile
which
sometimes
rushed
up
and
transformed
his
face
before
he
was
aware
of
the
occurrence
and
she
smiled
also
gazing
at
him
half
confidentially
she
was
a
little
woman
stoutish
indeed
stout
puffy
red
cheeks
a
too
remarkable
white
cotton
blouse
and
a
crimson
skirt
that
hung
unevenly
grey
cotton
gloves
a
green
sunshade
on
the
top
of
all
this
the
black
hat
with
red
roses
the
photograph
in
leek
must
have
been
taken
in
the
past
she
looked
quite
whereas
the
photograph
indicated
and
a
fraction
he
gazed
down
at
her
protectively
with
a
appreciative
condescension
i
suppose
you
have
to
be
going
back
again
soon
to
arrange
things
like
she
said
it
was
always
she
who
kept
the
conversation
afloat
no
he
said
i
finished
there
they
dismissed
me
who
have
the
relatives
why
he
shook
his
head
i
hope
you
made
them
pay
you
your
month
said
she
firmly
he
was
glad
to
be
able
to
give
a
satisfactory
answer
after
a
pause
she
resumed
bravely
so
farll
was
one
of
these
artists
at
least
so
i
see
according
to
the
paper
he
nodded
it
a
very
funny
business
she
said
but
i
suppose
there
some
of
them
make
quite
a
nice
income
out
of
it
ought
to
know
about
that
being
in
it
as
it
were
never
in
his
life
had
he
conversed
on
such
terms
with
such
a
person
as
alice
challice
she
was
in
every
way
a
novelty
for
him
in
clothes
manners
accent
deportment
outlook
on
the
world
and
on
paint
he
had
heard
and
read
of
such
beings
as
alice
challice
and
now
he
was
in
direct
contact
with
one
of
them
the
whole
affair
struck
him
as
excessively
odd
as
a
mad
escapade
on
his
part
wisdom
in
him
deemed
it
ridiculous
to
prolong
the
encounter
but
shy
folly
could
not
break
loose
moreover
she
possessed
the
charm
of
her
novelty
and
there
was
that
in
her
which
challenged
the
male
in
him
well
she
said
i
suppose
we
ca
stand
here
for
ever
the
crowd
had
frittered
itself
away
and
an
attendant
was
closing
and
locking
the
doors
of
george
hall
he
coughed
it
a
pity
it
saturday
and
all
the
shops
closed
but
anyhow
suppose
we
walk
along
oxford
street
all
the
same
shall
we
this
from
her
by
all
means
now
there
one
thing
i
should
like
to
say
she
murmured
with
a
calm
smile
as
they
moved
off
you
no
occasion
to
be
shy
with
me
no
call
for
it
i
just
as
you
see
me
shy
he
exclaimed
genuinely
surprised
do
i
seem
shy
to
you
he
thought
he
had
been
magnificently
doggish
oh
well
she
said
that
all
right
then
if
you
i
should
take
it
as
a
poor
compliment
being
shy
with
me
where
do
you
think
we
can
have
a
good
talk
i
free
for
the
evening
i
do
know
about
you
her
eyes
questioned
his
at
a
late
hour
they
were
entering
side
by
side
a
glittering
establishment
whose
interior
seemed
to
be
walled
chiefly
in
bevelled
glass
so
that
everywhere
the
curious
observer
saw
himself
and
twisted
fractions
of
himself
the
glass
was
relieved
at
frequent
intervals
by
elaborate
enamelled
signs
which
repeated
gratuities
it
seemed
that
the
directors
of
the
establishment
wished
to
make
perfectly
clear
to
visitors
that
whatever
else
they
might
find
they
must
on
no
account
expect
gratuities
i
always
wanted
to
come
here
said
alice
challice
vivaciously
glancing
up
at
priam
farll
modest
face
then
after
they
had
successfully
passed
through
a
preliminary
pair
of
bevelled
portals
a
huge
man
dressed
like
a
policeman
and
achieving
a
very
successful
imitation
of
a
policeman
stretched
out
his
hand
and
stopped
them
in
line
please
he
said
i
thought
it
was
a
restaurant
not
a
theatre
priam
whispered
to
challice
so
it
is
a
restaurant
said
his
companion
but
i
hear
they
obliged
to
do
like
this
because
there
always
such
a
crowd
it
very
is
it
he
agreed
that
it
was
he
felt
that
london
had
got
a
long
way
in
front
of
him
and
that
he
would
have
to
hurry
a
great
deal
before
he
could
catch
it
up
at
length
another
imitation
of
a
policeman
opened
more
doors
and
with
other
sinners
they
were
released
from
purgatory
into
a
clattering
paradise
which
again
offered
everything
save
gratuities
they
were
conducted
to
a
small
table
full
of
dirty
plates
and
empty
glasses
in
a
corner
of
the
vast
and
lofty
saloon
a
man
in
evening
dress
whose
eye
said
now
mind
no
insulting
gratuities
rushed
past
the
table
and
in
one
deft
amazing
gesture
swept
off
the
whole
of
its
contents
and
was
gone
with
them
it
was
an
astounding
feat
and
when
priam
recovered
from
his
amazement
he
fell
into
another
amazement
on
discovering
that
by
some
magic
means
the
man
in
evening
dress
had
insinuated
a
menu
into
his
hands
this
menu
was
exceedingly
long
it
comprised
everything
except
gratuities
and
evidently
knowing
from
experience
that
it
was
not
a
document
to
be
perused
and
exhausted
in
five
minutes
the
man
in
evening
dress
took
care
not
to
interrupt
the
studies
of
priam
farll
and
alice
challice
during
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
then
he
returned
like
a
bolt
put
them
through
an
examination
in
the
menu
and
fled
and
when
he
was
gone
they
saw
that
the
table
was
set
with
a
clean
cloth
and
instruments
and
empty
glasses
a
band
thereupon
burst
into
gay
strains
like
the
band
at
a
after
something
very
difficult
on
the
horizontal
bar
and
it
played
louder
and
louder
and
as
it
played
louder
so
the
people
talked
louder
and
the
crash
of
cymbals
mingled
with
the
crash
of
plates
and
the
altercations
of
knives
and
forks
with
the
shrill
accents
of
chatterers
determined
to
be
heard
and
men
in
evening
dress
a
costume
which
seemed
to
be
forbidden
to
sitters
at
tables
flitted
to
and
fro
with
inconceivable
rapidity
austere
preoccupied
conjurers
and
from
every
marble
wall
bevelled
mirror
and
doric
column
there
spoke
silently
but
insistently
the
haunting
legend
gratuities
thus
priam
farll
began
his
first
public
meal
in
modern
london
he
knew
the
hotels
he
knew
the
restaurants
of
countries
but
he
had
never
been
so
overwhelmed
as
he
was
here
remembering
london
as
a
city
of
wooden
he
could
scarcely
eat
for
the
thoughts
that
surged
through
his
brain
is
it
amusing
said
challice
benignantly
over
a
glass
of
lager
i
so
glad
you
brought
me
here
i
always
wanted
to
come
and
then
a
few
minutes
afterwards
she
was
saying
against
the
immense
din
you
know
i
been
thinking
for
years
of
getting
married
again
and
if
you
really
thinking
of
getting
married
what
are
you
to
do
you
may
sit
in
a
chair
and
wait
till
eggs
are
sixpence
a
dozen
and
be
no
nearer
you
must
do
something
and
what
is
there
except
a
matrimonial
agency
i
say
what
the
matter
with
a
matrimonial
agency
anyhow
if
you
want
to
get
married
you
want
to
get
married
and
it
no
use
pretending
you
do
i
do
hate
pretending
i
do
no
shame
in
wanting
to
get
married
is
there
i
think
a
matrimonial
agency
is
a
very
good
useful
thing
they
say
you
swindled
well
those
that
are
deserve
to
be
you
can
be
swindled
without
a
matrimonial
agency
seems
to
me
not
that
i
ever
been
plain
people
never
are
no
if
you
ask
me
matrimonial
agencies
are
the
most
sensible
things
after
that
ever
been
invented
and
i
sure
if
anything
comes
of
this
i
shall
pay
the
fees
with
the
greatest
pleasure
now
do
you
agree
with
me
the
whole
mystery
stood
explained
absolutely
he
said
and
felt
the
skin
creeping
in
the
small
of
his
back
chapter
iii
from
the
moment
of
challice
remarks
in
favour
of
matrimonial
agencies
priam
farll
existence
became
a
torture
to
him
she
was
what
he
had
always
been
accustomed
to
think
of
as
a
very
decent
woman
but
really
the
sentence
is
not
finished
because
priam
never
finished
it
in
his
own
mind
fifty
times
he
conducted
the
sentence
as
far
as
and
there
it
dissolved
into
an
uncomfortable
cloud
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
be
going
said
she
when
her
ice
had
been
eaten
and
his
had
melted
yes
said
he
and
added
to
himself
but
where
however
it
would
be
a
relief
to
get
out
of
the
restaurant
and
he
called
for
the
bill
while
they
were
waiting
for
the
bill
the
situation
grew
more
strained
priam
was
aware
of
a
desire
to
fling
down
sovereigns
on
the
table
and
rush
wildly
away
even
challice
vaguely
feeling
this
had
a
difficulty
in
conversing
you
like
your
photograph
she
remarked
glancing
at
his
face
which
it
should
be
said
had
very
much
changed
within
he
had
a
face
capable
of
a
hundred
expressions
per
day
his
present
expression
was
one
of
his
anxious
expressions
medium
in
degree
it
can
be
figured
in
the
mask
of
a
person
who
is
locked
up
in
an
iron
strongroom
and
feeling
ill
at
ease
notices
that
the
walls
are
getting
at
the
corners
like
my
photograph
he
exclaimed
astonished
that
he
should
resemble
leek
photograph
yes
she
asseverated
stoutly
i
knew
you
at
once
especially
by
the
nose
have
you
got
it
here
he
asked
interested
to
see
what
portrait
of
leek
had
a
nose
like
his
own
and
she
pulled
out
of
her
handbag
a
photograph
not
of
leek
but
of
priam
farll
it
was
an
unmounted
print
of
a
negative
which
he
and
leek
had
taken
together
for
the
purposes
of
a
pose
in
a
picture
and
it
had
decidedly
a
distinguished
appearance
but
why
should
leek
dispatch
photographs
of
his
master
to
strange
ladies
introduced
through
a
matrimonial
agency
priam
farll
could
not
imagine
unless
it
was
from
sheer
unscrupulous
careless
bounce
she
gazed
at
the
portrait
with
obvious
joy
now
candidly
do
think
it
very
very
good
she
demanded
i
suppose
it
is
he
agreed
he
would
probably
have
given
two
hundred
pounds
for
the
courage
to
explain
to
her
in
a
few
words
that
there
had
been
a
vast
mistake
a
huge
impulsive
indiscretion
but
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
would
not
have
bought
that
courage
i
love
it
she
ejaculated
fervently
with
heat
and
yet
so
nicely
and
she
returned
the
photograph
to
her
little
bag
she
lowered
her
voice
you
have
told
me
whether
you
were
ever
married
i
been
waiting
for
that
he
blushed
she
was
disconcertingly
personal
no
he
said
and
you
always
lived
like
that
alone
like
no
home
travelling
about
no
one
to
look
after
you
properly
there
was
distress
in
her
voice
he
nodded
one
gets
accustomed
to
it
oh
yes
she
said
i
can
understand
that
no
responsibilities
he
added
no
i
can
understand
all
that
then
she
hesitated
but
i
do
feel
so
sorry
for
you
all
these
years
and
her
eyes
were
moist
and
her
tone
was
so
sincere
that
priam
farll
found
it
quite
remarkably
affecting
of
course
she
was
talking
about
henry
leek
the
humble
valet
and
not
about
leek
illustrious
master
but
priam
saw
no
difference
between
his
lot
and
that
of
leek
he
felt
that
there
was
no
essential
difference
and
that
despite
multiple
perfections
as
a
valet
he
never
had
been
looked
after
properly
her
voice
made
him
feel
just
as
sorry
for
himself
as
she
was
sorry
for
him
it
made
him
feel
that
she
had
a
kind
heart
and
that
a
kind
heart
was
the
only
thing
on
earth
that
really
mattered
ah
if
lady
sophia
entwistle
had
spoken
to
him
in
such
accents
the
bill
came
it
was
so
small
that
he
was
ashamed
to
pay
it
the
suppression
of
gratuities
enabled
the
monarch
of
this
bevelled
palace
to
offer
a
complete
dinner
for
about
the
same
price
as
a
thimbleful
of
tea
and
ten
drachms
of
cake
a
few
yards
away
happily
the
monarch
foreseeing
his
shame
had
arranged
a
peculiar
method
of
payment
through
a
little
hole
where
the
receiver
could
see
nothing
but
his
blushing
hands
as
for
the
conjurers
in
evening
dress
they
apparently
never
soiled
themselves
by
contact
with
specie
outside
on
the
pavement
he
was
at
a
loss
what
to
do
you
see
he
was
entirely
unfamiliar
with
challice
code
of
etiquette
would
you
care
to
go
to
the
alhambra
or
somewhere
he
suggested
having
a
notion
that
this
was
the
correct
thing
to
say
to
a
lady
whose
presence
near
you
was
directly
due
to
her
desire
for
marriage
it
very
good
of
you
said
she
but
i
sure
you
only
say
it
out
of
kindness
because
you
a
gentleman
it
would
be
quite
nice
for
you
to
go
to
a
i
know
i
said
i
was
free
for
the
evening
but
i
was
thinking
it
was
a
hint
no
truly
i
think
i
shall
go
home
and
perhaps
some
other
i
shall
see
you
home
said
he
quickly
impulsive
again
would
you
really
like
to
can
you
in
the
bluish
glare
of
an
electricity
that
made
the
street
whiter
than
day
she
blushed
yes
she
blushed
like
a
girl
she
led
him
up
a
where
was
a
kind
of
railway
station
unfamiliar
to
priam
farll
experience
tiled
like
a
butcher
shop
and
as
clean
as
holland
under
her
direction
he
took
tickets
for
a
station
whose
name
he
had
never
heard
of
and
then
they
passed
through
steel
railings
which
clacked
behind
them
into
a
sort
of
safe
deposit
from
which
the
only
emergence
was
a
long
dim
tunnel
painted
hands
pointing
to
the
mysterious
word
waved
you
onwards
down
this
tunnel
hurry
up
please
came
a
voice
out
of
the
spectral
gloom
challice
thereupon
ran
now
up
the
tunnel
opposing
all
human
progress
there
blew
a
steady
of
tremendous
force
immediately
priam
began
to
run
the
removed
his
hat
which
sailed
buoyantly
back
towards
the
street
he
was
after
it
like
a
youth
of
twenty
and
he
recaptured
it
but
when
he
reached
the
extremity
of
the
tunnel
his
amazed
eyes
saw
nothing
but
a
great
cage
of
human
animals
pressed
tightly
together
behind
bars
there
was
a
click
and
the
whole
cage
sank
from
his
sight
into
the
earth
he
felt
that
there
was
more
than
he
had
dreamt
of
in
the
city
of
miracles
in
a
couple
of
minutes
another
cage
rose
into
the
tunnel
at
a
different
point
vomited
its
captives
and
descended
swiftly
again
with
priam
and
many
others
and
threw
him
and
the
rest
out
into
a
white
mine
consisting
of
numberless
galleries
he
ran
about
these
interminable
galleries
underneath
london
at
the
bidding
of
painted
hands
for
a
considerable
time
and
occasionally
magic
trains
without
engines
swept
across
his
vision
but
he
could
not
find
even
the
spirit
of
alice
challice
in
this
nether
world
on
headed
grand
babylon
hotel
london
he
was
writing
in
a
disguised
backward
hand
a
note
to
the
following
effect
duncan
farll
esq
sir
if
any
letters
or
telegrams
arrive
for
me
at
selwood
terrace
be
good
enough
to
have
them
forwarded
to
me
at
once
to
the
above
yours
truly
h
leek
it
cost
him
something
to
sign
the
name
of
the
dead
man
but
he
instinctively
guessed
that
duncan
farll
might
be
a
sieve
which
owing
to
its
would
easily
get
clogged
up
even
by
a
slight
suspicion
hence
in
order
to
be
sure
of
receiving
a
possible
letter
or
telegram
from
challice
he
must
openly
label
himself
as
henry
leek
he
had
lost
challice
there
was
no
address
on
her
letter
he
only
knew
that
she
lived
at
or
near
putney
and
the
sole
hope
of
finding
her
again
lay
in
the
fact
that
she
had
the
selwood
terrace
address
he
wanted
to
find
her
again
he
desired
that
ardently
if
merely
to
explain
to
her
that
their
separation
was
due
to
a
sudden
caprice
of
his
hat
and
that
he
had
searched
for
her
everywhere
in
the
mine
anxiously
desperately
she
would
surely
not
imagine
that
he
had
slipped
away
from
her
on
purpose
no
and
yet
if
incapable
of
such
an
enormity
why
had
she
not
waited
for
him
on
one
of
the
platforms
however
he
hoped
for
the
best
the
best
was
a
telegram
the
a
letter
on
receipt
of
which
he
would
fly
to
her
to
explain
and
besides
he
wanted
to
see
her
simply
her
answer
to
his
suggestion
of
a
and
the
tone
of
it
had
impressed
him
and
her
remark
i
do
feel
so
sorry
for
you
all
these
years
had
well
somewhat
changed
his
whole
outlook
on
life
yes
he
wanted
to
see
her
in
order
to
satisfy
himself
that
he
had
her
respect
a
woman
impossible
socially
a
woman
with
strange
habits
and
tricks
of
manner
no
doubt
there
were
millions
such
but
a
woman
whose
respect
one
would
not
forfeit
without
a
struggle
he
had
been
pushed
to
an
extremity
forced
to
act
with
swiftness
upon
losing
her
and
he
had
done
the
thing
that
comes
most
naturally
to
a
traveller
he
had
driven
to
the
best
hotel
in
the
town
he
had
seen
in
a
flash
that
the
idea
of
inhabiting
any
private
hotel
whatever
was
a
silly
idea
and
now
he
was
in
a
large
bedroom
the
thames
a
chamber
with
a
a
sofa
five
electric
lights
two
a
telephone
electric
bells
and
a
massive
oak
door
with
a
lock
and
a
key
in
the
lock
in
short
his
castle
an
enterprise
of
some
daring
to
storm
the
castle
but
he
had
stormed
it
he
had
registered
under
the
name
of
leek
a
name
sufficiently
common
not
to
excite
remark
and
the
had
proved
to
be
an
admirable
young
man
he
trusted
to
the
and
to
the
telephone
for
avoiding
any
rough
contact
with
the
world
he
felt
comparatively
safe
now
the
entire
enormous
hotel
was
a
nest
for
his
shyness
a
conspiracy
to
keep
him
in
he
was
an
autocratic
number
absolute
ruler
over
room
and
with
the
right
to
command
the
almost
limitless
resources
of
the
grand
babylon
for
his
own
private
ends
as
he
sealed
the
envelope
he
touched
a
bell
the
valet
entered
you
got
the
evening
papers
asked
priam
farll
yes
sir
the
valet
put
a
pile
of
papers
respectfully
on
the
desk
all
of
them
yes
sir
thanks
well
it
not
too
late
to
have
a
messenger
is
it
oh
sir
late
in
the
grand
babylon
oh
czar
said
the
valet
shocked
tone
then
please
get
a
messenger
to
take
this
letter
at
once
in
a
cab
sir
yes
in
a
cab
i
do
know
whether
there
will
be
an
answer
he
will
see
then
let
him
call
at
the
at
south
kensington
station
and
get
my
luggage
here
the
ticket
thank
you
sir
i
can
rely
on
you
to
see
that
he
goes
at
once
you
can
sir
said
the
valet
in
such
accents
as
carry
absolute
conviction
thank
you
that
will
do
i
think
the
man
retired
and
the
door
was
closed
by
an
expert
in
closing
doors
one
who
had
devoted
his
life
to
the
perfection
of
detail
in
valetry
he
lay
on
the
sofa
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
with
all
illumination
extinguished
save
one
light
immediately
above
him
the
evening
papers
white
green
rose
cream
and
yellow
shared
his
couch
he
was
about
to
glance
at
the
obituaries
to
glance
at
them
in
a
careless
condescending
way
just
to
see
the
of
thing
that
journalists
had
written
of
him
he
knew
the
value
of
obituaries
he
had
often
smiled
at
them
he
knew
also
the
exceeding
fatuity
of
art
criticism
which
did
not
cause
him
even
to
smile
being
simply
a
bore
he
recollected
further
that
he
was
not
the
first
man
to
read
his
own
obituary
the
adventure
had
happened
to
others
and
he
could
recall
how
on
his
having
heard
that
owing
to
an
error
it
had
happened
to
the
great
he
in
his
quality
of
philosopher
had
instantly
decided
what
frame
of
mind
the
great
ought
to
have
assumed
for
the
perusal
of
his
biography
he
carefully
and
deliberately
adopted
that
frame
of
mind
now
he
thought
of
marcus
aurelius
on
the
futility
of
fame
he
remembered
his
attitude
of
gentle
tired
scorn
for
the
press
he
reflected
with
wise
modesty
that
in
art
nothing
counts
but
the
work
itself
and
that
no
quantity
of
inept
chatter
could
possibly
affect
for
good
or
evil
his
value
such
as
it
might
be
to
the
world
then
he
began
to
open
the
papers
the
first
glimpse
of
their
contents
made
him
jump
in
fact
the
physical
result
of
it
was
quite
extraordinary
his
temperature
increased
his
heart
became
audible
his
pulse
quickened
and
there
was
a
tingling
as
far
off
as
his
toes
he
had
felt
in
a
dim
unacknowledged
way
that
he
must
be
a
pretty
great
painter
of
course
his
prices
were
notorious
and
he
had
guessed
though
vaguely
that
he
was
the
object
of
widespread
curiosity
but
he
had
never
compared
himself
with
titanic
figures
on
the
planet
it
had
always
seemed
to
him
that
renown
was
different
from
other
renowns
less
somehow
unreal
and
he
had
never
imaginatively
grasped
despite
prices
and
public
inquisitiveness
that
he
too
was
one
of
the
titanic
figures
he
grasped
it
now
the
aspect
of
the
papers
brought
it
home
to
him
with
tremendous
force
special
large
type
titles
stretching
across
two
columns
black
borders
round
the
pages
death
of
england
greatest
painter
sudden
death
of
priam
farll
sad
death
of
a
great
genius
puzzling
career
prematurely
closed
europe
in
mourning
irreparable
loss
to
the
world
art
it
is
with
the
most
profound
regret
our
readers
will
be
shocked
the
news
will
come
as
a
personal
blow
to
every
lover
of
great
painting
so
the
papers
went
on
outvying
each
other
in
enthusiastic
grief
he
ceased
to
be
careless
and
condescending
to
them
the
skin
crept
along
his
spine
there
he
lay
solitary
under
the
crimson
glow
locked
in
his
castle
human
with
the
outward
semblance
of
a
man
like
other
men
and
yet
the
cities
of
europe
were
weeping
for
him
he
heard
them
weeping
every
lover
of
great
painting
was
under
a
sense
of
personal
bereavement
the
very
voice
of
the
world
was
hushed
after
all
it
was
something
to
have
done
your
best
after
all
good
stuff
appreciated
by
the
mass
of
the
race
the
phenomena
presented
by
the
evening
papers
was
certainly
prodigious
and
prodigiously
affecting
mankind
was
unpleasantly
stunned
by
the
report
of
his
decease
he
forgot
that
challice
for
instance
had
perfectly
succeeded
in
hiding
her
grief
for
the
irreparable
loss
and
that
her
questions
about
priam
farll
had
been
almost
perfunctory
he
forgot
that
he
had
witnessed
absolutely
no
sign
of
overwhelming
sorrow
or
of
any
degree
of
sorrow
in
the
thoroughfares
of
the
teeming
capital
and
that
the
hotels
did
not
resound
to
sobbing
he
knew
only
that
all
europe
was
in
mourning
i
suppose
i
was
rather
wonderful
i
mean
he
said
to
himself
dazed
and
happy
yes
happy
the
fact
is
i
got
so
used
to
my
own
work
that
perhaps
i
do
think
enough
of
it
he
said
this
as
modestly
as
he
could
there
was
no
question
now
of
casually
glancing
at
the
obituaries
he
could
not
miss
a
single
line
a
single
word
he
even
regretted
that
the
details
of
his
life
were
so
few
and
unimportant
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
the
business
of
the
journalists
to
have
known
more
to
have
displayed
more
enterprise
in
acquiring
information
still
the
tone
was
right
the
fellows
meant
well
at
any
rate
his
eyes
encountered
nothing
but
praise
indeed
the
press
of
london
had
yielded
itself
up
to
an
encomiastic
orgy
his
modesty
tried
to
say
that
this
was
slightly
overdone
but
his
impartiality
asked
really
what
they
say
against
me
as
a
rule
unmitigated
praise
was
nauseous
but
here
they
were
undoubtedly
genuine
the
fellows
their
sentences
rang
true
never
in
his
life
had
he
been
so
satisfied
with
the
scheme
of
the
universe
he
was
nearly
consoled
for
the
dissolution
of
leek
when
after
continued
reading
he
came
across
a
phrase
which
discreetly
insinuated
apropos
of
the
policeman
and
the
penguins
that
capriciousness
in
the
choice
of
subject
was
perhaps
a
pose
with
him
the
accusation
hurt
pose
he
inwardly
exclaimed
what
a
lie
the
man
an
ass
and
he
resented
the
following
remark
which
concluded
a
extremely
laudatory
in
matter
and
manner
by
an
expert
whose
books
he
had
always
respected
however
contemporary
judgments
are
in
the
large
majority
of
cases
notoriously
wrong
and
it
behooves
us
to
remember
this
in
choosing
a
niche
for
our
idol
time
alone
can
settle
the
ultimate
position
of
priam
farll
useless
for
his
modesty
to
whisper
to
him
that
contemporary
judgments
notoriously
wrong
he
did
not
like
it
it
disturbed
him
there
were
exceptions
to
every
rule
and
if
the
connoisseur
meant
anything
at
all
he
was
simply
stultifying
the
rest
of
the
article
time
be
d
d
he
had
come
nearly
to
the
last
line
of
the
last
obituary
before
he
was
finally
ruffled
most
of
the
sheets
in
excusing
the
paucity
of
biographical
detail
had
remarked
that
priam
farll
was
utterly
unknown
to
london
society
of
a
retiring
disposition
hating
publicity
a
recluse
etc
the
word
recluse
grated
on
his
sensitiveness
a
little
but
when
the
least
important
of
the
evening
papers
roundly
asserted
it
to
be
notorious
that
he
was
of
extremely
eccentric
habits
he
grew
secretly
furious
neither
his
modesty
nor
his
philosophy
was
influential
enough
to
restore
him
to
complete
calm
eccentric
he
what
next
eccentric
indeed
now
what
conceivable
justification
ruling
between
a
and
eleven
he
was
seated
alone
at
a
small
table
in
the
restaurant
of
the
grand
babylon
he
had
had
no
news
of
challice
she
had
not
instantly
telegraphed
to
selwood
terrace
as
he
had
wildly
hoped
but
in
the
boxes
of
henry
leek
safely
retrieved
by
the
messenger
from
south
kensington
station
he
had
discovered
one
of
his
old
not
too
old
and
this
he
had
donned
the
desire
to
move
about
unknown
in
the
world
the
world
of
the
frequenters
of
costly
hotels
the
world
to
which
he
was
accustomed
had
overtaken
him
moreover
he
felt
hungry
hence
he
had
descended
to
the
famous
restaurant
whose
wide
windows
were
flung
open
to
the
illuminated
majesty
of
the
thames
embankment
the
pale
cream
room
was
nearly
full
of
expensive
women
and
expending
men
and
waiters
whose
skilled
noiseless
inhuman
attentions
were
remunerated
at
the
rate
of
about
a
minute
music
the
midnight
food
of
love
floated
scarce
heard
through
the
tinted
atmosphere
it
was
the
best
imitation
of
roman
luxury
that
london
could
offer
and
after
selwood
terrace
and
the
rackety
palace
of
no
gratuities
priam
farll
enjoyed
it
as
one
enjoys
home
after
strange
climes
next
to
his
table
was
an
empty
table
set
for
two
to
which
were
presently
conducted
with
due
state
a
young
man
and
a
magnificent
woman
whose
youth
was
slipping
off
her
polished
shoulders
like
a
cloak
priam
farll
then
overheard
the
following
conversation
well

only
heard
of
it
because
we
telephoned
to
him
but
the
fellow
would
scarcely
tell
me
anything
at
all
really
i
do
hope
there
something
terrible
why
so
that
i
can
go
to
the
inquest
or
the
police
court
or
whatever
it
is
that
why

always
keep
friendly
with
magistrates
it
so
frightfully
thrilling
sitting
on
the
bench
with
them

be
any
inquest

something
queer
in
it
you
see
priam
farll
was
never
in
england

abroad

those
foreign
hotels
wandering
up
and
down

hotel

ostend

sort

man

story

up
to
you

it
maria
lady
rowndell
insists
on
giving
me
a
hundred
a
year
to
pay
for
it
it
is
her
own
beautiful
way
of
helping
the
good
cause
ice
please
waiter
i
just
been
seeing
her
she
staying
here
for
the
season
saves
her
a
lot
of
trouble
she
very
much
cut
up
about
the
death
of
priam
farll
poor
thing
so
artistic
you
know
the
late
lord
rowndell
had
what
is
supposed
to
be
the
finest
lot
of
farlls
in
england
did
you
ever
meet
priam
farll
father
luke
never
i
understand
he
was
most
eccentric
i
hate
eccentricity
i
once
wrote
to
him
to
ask
him
if
he
would
paint
a
holy
family
for
bede
and
what
did
he
reply
he
did
reply
considering
that
he
was
even
an
i
do
think
that
it
was
quite
nice
of
him
however
maria
lady
rowndell
insists
that
he
must
be
buried
in
westminster
abbey
she
asked
me
what
i
could
do
buried
in
westminster
abbey
i
no
idea
he
was
so
big
as
all
that
gracious
i
have
the
greatest
confidence
in
maria
lady
rowndell
taste
and
certainly
i
bear
no
grudge
i
may
be
able
to
arrange
something
my
uncle
the
dean
pardon
me
i
always
understood
that
since
you
left
the
church
since
i
joined
the
church
you
mean
there
is
but
one
church
of
england
i
meant
ah
since
you
left
the
church
of
england
there
had
been
a
breach
between
the
dean
and
yourself
merely
religious
besides
my
sister
is
the
dean
favourite
niece
and
i
am
her
favourite
brother
my
sister
takes
much
interest
in
art
she
has
just
painted
a
really
exquisite
for
me
of
course
the
dean
ultimately
settles
these
questions
of
national
funerals
hence
at
this
point
the
invisible
orchestra
began
to
play
god
save
the
king
oh
what
a
bore
then
nearly
all
the
lights
were
extinguished
please
gentlemen
gentlemen
please
you
quite
understand
docksey
that
i
merely
gave
these
family
details
in
order
to
substantiate
my
statement
that
i
may
be
able
to
arrange
something
by
the
way
if
you
would
care
to
have
a
typescript
of
my
sermon
for
the
you
can
have
one
by
applying
at
the
vestry
please
gentlemen
so
good
of
you
as
regards
the
burial
in
westminster
abbey
i
think
that
the
will
support
the
project
i
say
i
maria
lady
rowndell
will
be
grateful
of
the
remaining
lights
went
out
and
the
entire
company
followed
them
in
the
foyer
there
was
a
prodigious
crush
of
opera
cloaks
silk
hats
and
cigars
all
jostling
together
news
arrived
from
the
strand
that
the
weather
had
turned
to
rain
and
all
the
intellect
of
the
grand
babylon
was
centred
upon
the
british
climate
exactly
as
if
the
british
climate
had
been
the
latest
discovery
of
science
as
the
doors
swung
to
and
fro
the
stridency
of
whistles
the
throbbing
of
and
the
hoarse
cries
of
inhabitants
of
box
seats
mingled
strangely
with
the
delicate
babble
of
the
interior
then
lo
as
by
magic
the
foyer
was
empty
save
for
the
denizens
of
the
hotel
who
could
produce
evidence
of
identity
it
had
been
proved
to
demonstration
for
the
sixth
time
that
week
that
in
the
metropolis
of
the
greatest
of
empires
there
is
not
one
law
for
the
rich
and
another
for
the
poor
deeply
affected
by
what
he
had
overheard
priam
farll
rose
in
a
lift
and
sought
his
bed
he
perceived
clearly
that
he
had
been
among
the
governing
classes
of
the
realm
chapter
iv
within
less
than
twelve
hours
after
that
conversation
between
members
of
the
governing
classes
at
the
grand
babylon
hotel
priam
farll
heard
the
first
echoes
of
the
voice
of
england
on
the
question
of
his
funeral
the
voice
of
england
issued
on
this
occasion
through
the
mouth
of
the
a
newspaper
which
belonged
to
lord
nasing
the
proprietor
of
the
there
was
a
column
in
the
partly
concerning
the
meeting
of
priam
farll
and
a
celebrated
star
of
the
musical
comedy
stage
at
ostend
there
was
also
a
leading
article
in
which
it
was
made
perfectly
clear
that
england
would
stand
ashamed
among
the
nations
if
she
did
not
inter
her
greatest
painter
in
westminster
abbey
only
the
article
instead
of
saying
westminster
abbey
said
national
valhalla
it
seemed
to
make
a
point
of
not
mentioning
westminster
abbey
by
name
as
though
westminster
abbey
had
been
something
not
quite
mentionable
such
as
a
pair
of
trousers
the
article
ended
with
the
word
and
by
the
time
you
had
reached
this
majestic
substantive
you
felt
indeed
with
the
that
a
national
valhalla
without
the
remains
of
a
priam
farll
inside
it
would
be
shocking
if
not
inconceivable
priam
farll
was
extremely
disturbed
on
monday
morning
the
came
nobly
to
the
support
of
the
it
had
evidently
spent
its
sunday
in
collecting
the
opinions
of
a
number
of
famous
men
including
three
a
banker
a
colonial
premier
a
a
cricketer
and
the
president
of
the
royal
academy
as
to
whether
the
national
valhalla
was
or
was
not
a
suitable
place
for
the
repose
of
the
remains
of
priam
farll
and
the
unanimous
reply
was
in
the
affirmative
other
newspapers
expressed
the
same
view
but
there
were
opponents
of
the
scheme
some
organs
coldly
inquired
what
priam
farll
had
for
england
and
particularly
for
the
higher
life
of
england
he
had
not
been
a
moral
painter
like
hogarth
or
sir
noel
paton
nor
a
worshipper
of
classic
legend
and
beauty
like
the
unique
leighton
he
had
openly
scorned
england
he
had
never
lived
in
england
he
had
avoided
the
royal
academy
honouring
every
country
save
his
own
and
was
he
such
a
great
painter
after
all
was
he
anything
but
a
clever
dauber
whose
work
had
been
forced
into
general
admiration
by
the
efforts
of
a
small
clique
of
eccentric
admirers
far
be
it
from
them
the
organs
to
decry
a
dead
man
but
the
national
valhalla
was
the
national
valhalla
and
so
on
the
penny
evening
papers
were
one
of
them
furiously
so
you
gathered
that
if
priam
farll
was
not
buried
in
westminster
abbey
the
penny
evening
papers
would
from
mere
disgust
wipe
their
boots
on
dover
cliffs
and
quit
england
eternally
for
some
land
where
art
was
understood
you
gathered
by
nightfall
that
fleet
street
must
be
a
scene
of
carnage
full
of
enthusiasts
cutting
each
other
throats
for
the
sake
of
the
honour
of
art
however
no
abnormal
phenomenon
was
superficially
observable
in
fleet
street
nor
was
martial
law
proclaimed
at
the
arts
club
in
dover
street
london
was
impassioned
by
the
question
of
farll
funeral
a
few
hours
would
decide
if
england
was
to
be
shamed
among
the
nations
and
yet
the
town
seemed
to
pursue
its
way
exactly
as
usual
the
gaiety
theatre
performed
its
celebrated
nightly
musical
comedy
house
full
and
at
queen
hall
quite
a
large
audience
was
collected
to
listen
to
a
violinist
aged
twelve
who
played
like
a
man
though
a
little
one
and
whose
services
had
been
bought
for
seven
years
by
a
limited
company
the
next
morning
the
controversy
was
settled
by
one
of
the
characteristic
in
the
nature
of
the
case
such
controversies
if
they
are
not
settled
quickly
settle
themselves
quickly
they
can
not
be
prolonged
but
it
was
the
that
settled
this
one
the
came
out
with
a
copy
of
the
will
of
priam
farll
in
which
after
leaving
a
pound
a
week
for
life
to
his
valet
henry
leek
priam
farll
bequeathed
the
remainder
of
his
fortune
to
the
nation
for
the
building
and
of
a
gallery
of
great
masters
priam
farll
own
collection
of
great
masters
gradually
made
by
him
in
that
inexpensive
manner
which
is
possible
only
to
the
finest
connoisseurs
was
to
form
the
nucleus
of
the
gallery
it
comprised
said
the
several
rembrandts
a
velasquez
six
vermeers
a
giorgione
a
turner
a
charles
two
cromes
a
holbein
after
charles
the
put
a
note
of
interrogation
itself
being
uncertain
of
the
name
the
pictures
were
in
paris
had
been
for
many
years
the
leading
idea
of
the
gallery
was
that
nothing
not
absolutely
should
be
admitted
to
it
the
testator
attached
two
conditions
to
the
bequest
one
was
that
his
own
name
should
be
inscribed
nowhere
in
the
building
and
the
other
was
that
none
of
his
own
pictures
should
be
admitted
to
the
gallery
was
not
this
sublime
was
not
this
true
british
pride
was
not
this
magnificently
unlike
the
ordinary
benefactor
of
his
country
the
was
in
a
position
to
assert
that
priam
farll
estate
would
amount
to
about
a
hundred
and
forty
thousand
pounds
in
addition
to
the
value
of
the
pictures
after
that
was
anybody
going
to
argue
that
he
ought
not
to
be
buried
in
the
national
valhalla
a
philanthropist
so
royal
and
so
proudly
meek
the
opposition
gave
up
priam
farll
grew
more
and
more
disturbed
in
his
fortress
at
the
grand
babylon
hotel
he
perfectly
remembered
making
the
will
he
had
made
it
about
seventeen
years
before
after
some
champagne
in
venice
in
an
hour
of
anger
against
some
english
criticisms
of
his
work
yes
english
criticisms
it
was
his
vanity
that
had
prompted
him
to
reply
in
that
manner
moreover
he
was
quite
young
then
he
remembered
the
youthful
glee
with
which
he
had
appointed
his
whoever
they
might
be
executors
and
trustees
of
the
will
he
remembered
his
cruel
joy
in
picturing
their
disgust
at
being
compelled
to
carry
out
the
terms
of
such
a
will
often
since
he
had
meant
to
destroy
the
will
but
carelessly
he
had
always
omitted
to
do
so
and
his
collection
and
his
fortune
had
continued
to
increase
regularly
and
mightily
and
now
well
there
the
thing
was
duncan
farll
had
found
the
will
and
duncan
farll
would
be
the
executor
and
trustee
of
that
melodramatic
testament
he
could
not
help
smiling
serious
as
the
situation
was
during
that
day
the
thing
was
settled
the
authorities
spoke
the
word
went
forth
priam
farll
was
to
be
buried
in
westminster
abbey
on
the
thursday
the
dignity
of
england
among
artistic
nations
had
been
saved
partly
by
the
heroic
efforts
of
the
and
partly
by
the
will
which
proved
that
after
all
priam
farll
had
had
the
highest
interests
of
his
country
at
heart
on
the
night
between
tuesday
and
wednesday
priam
farll
had
not
a
moment
of
sleep
whether
it
was
the
voice
of
england
that
had
spoken
or
merely
the
voice
of
the
dean
favourite
niece
so
skilled
in
painting
the
affair
was
excessively
serious
for
the
nation
was
preparing
to
inter
in
the
national
valhalla
the
remains
of
just
henry
leek
priam
mind
had
often
a
sardonic
turn
he
was
assuredly
capable
of
strange
caprices
but
even
he
could
not
permit
an
error
so
gigantic
to
continue
the
matter
must
be
rectified
and
instantly
and
he
alone
could
rectify
it
the
strain
on
his
shyness
would
be
awful
would
be
scarcely
endurable
nevertheless
he
must
act
quite
apart
from
other
considerations
there
was
the
consideration
of
that
hundred
and
forty
thousand
pounds
which
was
his
and
which
he
had
not
the
slightest
desire
to
leave
to
the
british
nation
and
as
for
giving
his
beloved
pictures
to
the
race
which
adored
landseer
edwin
long
and
leighton
the
idea
nauseated
him
he
must
go
and
see
duncan
farll
and
explain
yes
explain
that
he
was
not
dead
then
he
had
a
vision
of
duncan
farll
hard
stupid
face
and
impenetrable
steel
head
and
of
himself
being
kicked
out
of
the
house
or
delivered
over
to
a
policeman
or
in
some
subtler
way
unimaginably
insulted
could
he
confront
duncan
farll
was
a
hundred
and
forty
thousand
pounds
and
the
dignity
of
the
british
nation
worth
the
bearding
of
duncan
farll
no
his
distaste
for
duncan
farll
amounted
to
more
than
a
hundred
and
forty
millions
of
pounds
and
the
dignity
of
whole
planets
he
felt
that
he
could
never
bring
himself
to
meet
duncan
farll
why
duncan
might
shove
him
into
a
lunatic
asylum
might
still
he
must
act
then
it
was
that
occurred
to
him
the
brilliant
notion
of
making
a
clean
breast
of
it
to
the
dean
he
had
not
the
pleasure
of
the
dean
personal
acquaintance
the
dean
was
an
abstraction
certainly
much
more
abstract
than
priam
farll
he
thought
he
could
meet
the
dean
a
terrific
enterprise
but
he
must
accomplish
it
after
all
a
dean
what
was
it
nothing
but
a
man
with
a
funny
hat
and
was
not
he
himself
priam
farll
the
authentic
priam
farll
vastly
greater
than
any
dean
he
told
the
valet
to
buy
black
gloves
and
a
silk
hat
sized
seven
and
a
quarter
and
to
bring
up
a
copy
of
he
hoped
the
valet
would
be
dilatory
in
executing
these
commands
but
the
valet
seemed
to
fulfill
them
by
magic
time
flew
so
fast
that
in
a
way
of
speaking
you
could
hardly
see
the
fingers
as
they
whirled
round
the
clock
and
almost
before
he
knew
where
he
was
two
commissionaires
were
helping
him
into
an
and
the
terrific
enterprise
had
begun
the
would
easily
have
won
the
race
for
the
gordon
bennett
cup
it
was
of
about
two
hundred
and
it
arrived
in
dean
yard
in
less
time
than
a
fluent
speaker
would
take
to
say
jack
robinson
the
rapidity
of
the
flight
was
simply
incredible
i
keep
you
priam
farll
was
going
to
say
as
he
descended
but
he
thought
it
would
be
more
final
to
dismiss
the
machine
so
he
dismissed
it
he
rang
the
bell
with
frantic
haste
lest
he
should
run
away
ere
he
had
rung
it
and
then
his
heart
went
thumping
and
the
perspiration
damped
the
lovely
lining
of
his
new
hat
and
his
legs
trembled
literally
he
was
in
hell
on
the
dean
doorstep
the
door
was
opened
by
a
man
in
livery
of
prelatical
black
who
eyed
him
inimically
er
stammered
priam
farll
utterly
flustered
and
craven
is
this
mr
parker
now
parker
was
not
the
dean
name
and
priam
knew
that
it
was
not
parker
was
merely
the
first
name
that
had
come
into
priam
cowardly
head
no
it
is
said
the
flunkey
with
censorious
lips
it
the
dean
oh
i
beg
pardon
said
priam
farll
i
thought
it
was
mr
parker
and
he
departed
between
the
ringing
of
the
bell
and
the
flunkey
appearance
he
had
clearly
seen
what
he
was
capable
and
what
he
was
incapable
of
doing
and
the
correction
of
england
error
was
among
his
incapacities
he
could
not
face
the
dean
he
could
not
face
any
one
he
was
a
poltroon
in
all
these
things
a
poltroon
no
use
arguing
he
could
not
do
it
i
thought
it
was
mr
parker
good
heavens
to
what
depths
can
a
great
artist
fall
that
evening
he
received
a
cold
letter
from
duncan
farll
with
a
for
the
funeral
duncan
farll
did
not
venture
to
be
sure
that
henry
leek
would
think
proper
to
attend
his
master
interment
but
he
enclosed
a
ticket
he
also
stated
that
the
pound
a
week
would
be
paid
to
him
in
due
course
lastly
he
stated
that
several
newspaper
representatives
had
demanded
henry
leek
address
but
he
had
not
thought
fit
to
gratify
this
curiosity
priam
was
glad
of
that
well
i
dashed
he
reflected
handling
the
ticket
for
the
nave
there
it
was
large
glossy
real
as
life
the
in
the
vast
nave
there
were
relatively
few
people
that
is
to
say
a
few
hundred
who
had
sufficient
room
to
move
easily
to
and
fro
under
the
eyes
of
officials
priam
farll
had
been
admitted
through
the
cloisters
according
to
the
direction
printed
on
the
ticket
in
his
nervous
fancy
he
imagined
that
everybody
must
be
gazing
at
him
suspiciously
but
the
fact
was
that
he
occupied
the
attention
of
no
one
at
all
he
was
with
the
unprivileged
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
massive
screen
which
separated
the
nave
from
the
packed
choir
and
transepts
and
the
unprivileged
are
never
interested
in
themselves
it
is
the
privileged
who
interest
them
the
organ
was
wafting
a
melody
of
purcell
to
the
furthest
limits
of
the
abbey
round
a
roped
space
a
few
ecclesiastical
uniforms
kept
watch
over
the
ground
that
would
be
the
tomb
the
sunlight
of
noon
beat
and
quivered
in
long
lances
through
crimson
and
blue
windows
then
the
functionaries
began
to
form
an
aisle
among
the
spectators
and
emotion
grew
tenser
the
organ
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
when
it
recommenced
its
song
the
song
was
the
supreme
expression
of
human
grief
the
dirge
of
chopin
wrapping
the
whole
cathedral
in
heavy
folds
of
sorrow
and
as
that
appeal
expired
in
the
pulsating
air
the
fresh
voices
of
little
boys
sweeter
even
than
grief
rose
in
the
distance
it
was
at
this
point
that
priam
farll
descried
lady
sophia
entwistle
a
tall
veiled
figure
in
full
mourning
she
had
come
among
the
comparatively
unprivileged
to
his
funeral
doubtless
influence
such
as
hers
could
have
obtained
her
a
seat
in
the
transept
but
she
had
preferred
the
secluded
humility
of
the
nave
she
had
come
from
paris
for
his
funeral
she
was
weeping
for
her
affianced
she
stood
there
actually
within
ten
yards
of
him
she
had
not
caught
sight
of
him
but
she
might
do
so
at
any
moment
and
she
was
slowly
approaching
the
spot
where
he
trembled
he
fled
with
nothing
in
his
heart
but
resentment
against
her
she
had
not
proposed
to
him
he
had
proposed
to
her
she
had
not
thrown
him
aside
he
had
thrown
her
aside
he
was
not
one
of
her
mistakes
she
was
one
of
his
mistakes
not
she
but
he
had
been
capricious
impulsive
hasty
yet
he
hated
her
he
genuinely
thought
she
had
sinned
against
him
and
that
she
ought
to
be
exterminated
he
condemned
her
for
all
manner
of
things
as
to
which
she
had
had
no
choice
for
instance
the
irregularity
of
her
teeth
and
the
hollow
under
her
chin
and
the
little
tricks
of
deportment
which
are
always
developed
by
a
spinster
as
she
reaches
forty
he
fled
in
terror
of
her
if
she
should
have
a
glimpse
of
him
and
should
recognize
him
the
consequence
would
be
absolutely
disastrous
disastrous
in
every
way
and
a
period
of
publicity
would
dawn
for
him
such
as
he
could
not
possibly
contemplate
either
in
cold
blood
or
warm
he
fled
blindly
insinuating
himself
through
the
crowd
until
he
reached
a
grille
in
which
was
a
gate
ajar
his
strange
stare
must
have
affrighted
the
guardian
of
the
gate
for
the
robed
fellow
stood
away
and
priam
passed
within
the
grille
where
were
winding
steps
which
he
mounted
up
the
steps
ran
coils
of
he
heard
the
click
of
the
gate
as
the
attendant
shut
it
and
he
was
thankful
for
an
escape
the
steps
led
to
the
perched
on
the
top
of
the
massive
screen
the
organist
was
seated
behind
a
curtain
under
shaded
electric
lights
and
on
the
ample
platform
whose
parapet
overlooked
the
choir
were
two
young
men
who
whispered
with
the
organist
none
of
the
three
even
glanced
at
priam
priam
sat
down
on
a
windsor
chair
fearfully
like
an
intruder
his
face
towards
the
choir
the
whispers
ceased
the
organist
fingers
began
to
move
over
five
rows
of
notes
and
over
scores
of
stops
while
his
feet
groped
beneath
and
priam
heard
music
afar
off
and
close
behind
him
he
heard
rumblings
steamy
vibrations
and
as
it
were
sudden
escapes
of
gas
and
comprehended
that
these
were
the
hoarse
responses
of
the
and
foot
pipes
laid
horizontally
along
the
roof
of
the
screen
to
the
summoning
fingers
of
the
organist
it
was
all
uncanny
weird
supernatural
demoniacal
if
you
will
it
was
part
of
the
secret
and
unsuspected
mechanism
of
a
vast
emotional
pageant
and
spectacle
it
unnerved
priam
especially
when
the
organist
a
handsome
youngish
man
with
lustrous
eyes
half
turned
and
winked
at
one
of
his
companions
the
thrilling
voices
of
the
choristers
grew
louder
and
as
they
grew
louder
priam
farll
was
conscious
of
unaccustomed
phenomena
in
his
throat
which
shut
and
opened
of
itself
convulsively
to
divert
his
attention
from
his
throat
he
partially
rose
from
the
windsor
chair
and
peeped
over
the
parapet
of
the
screen
into
the
choir
whose
depths
were
candlelit
and
whose
altitudes
were
capriciously
bathed
by
the
intermittent
splendours
of
the
sun
high
high
up
in
front
of
him
at
the
summit
of
a
precipice
of
stone
a
little
window
out
of
the
sunshine
burned
sullenly
in
a
gloom
of
complicated
perspectives
and
far
below
stretched
round
the
pulpit
and
disappearing
among
the
forest
of
statuary
in
the
transept
was
a
floor
consisting
of
the
heads
of
the
privileged
famous
renowned
notorious
by
heredity
talent
enterprise
or
hazard
he
had
read
many
of
their
names
in
the
the
voices
of
the
choristers
had
become
piercing
in
their
beauty
priam
frankly
stood
up
and
leaned
over
the
parapet
every
gaze
was
turned
to
a
point
under
him
which
he
could
not
see
and
then
something
swayed
from
beneath
into
the
field
of
his
vision
it
was
a
tall
cross
borne
by
a
beadle
in
the
wake
of
the
cross
there
came
to
view
gorgeous
ecclesiastics
in
pairs
and
then
a
robed
man
walking
backwards
and
gesticulating
in
the
manner
of
some
important
excited
official
of
the
salvation
army
and
after
this
violet
robe
arrived
the
scarlet
choristers
singing
to
the
beat
of
his
gesture
and
then
swung
into
view
the
coffin
covered
with
a
heavy
purple
pall
and
on
the
pall
a
single
white
cross
and
the
great
european
names
that
had
hurried
out
of
the
corners
of
europe
as
at
a
peremptory
mandate
with
duncan
farll
to
complete
the
tale
was
it
the
coffin
or
the
richness
of
its
pall
or
the
solitary
whiteness
of
its
cross
of
flowers
or
the
august
authority
of
the
bearers
that
affected
priam
farll
like
a
blow
on
the
heart
who
knows
but
the
fact
was
that
he
could
look
no
more
the
scene
was
too
much
for
him
had
he
continued
to
look
he
would
have
burst
uncontrollably
into
tears
it
mattered
not
that
the
corpse
of
a
common
rascally
valet
lay
under
that
pall
it
mattered
not
that
a
grotesque
error
was
being
enacted
it
mattered
not
whether
the
actuating
spring
of
the
immense
affair
was
the
dean
niece
or
the
solemn
deliberations
of
the
chapter
it
mattered
not
that
newspapers
had
ignobly
misused
the
name
and
honour
of
art
for
their
own
advancement
the
instant
effect
was
overwhelmingly
impressive
all
that
had
been
honest
and
sincere
in
the
heart
of
england
for
a
thousand
years
leapt
mystically
up
and
made
it
impossible
that
the
effect
should
be
other
than
overwhelmingly
impressive
it
was
an
effect
beyond
argument
and
reason
it
was
the
magic
flowering
of
centuries
in
a
single
moment
the
silent
awful
sigh
of
a
nation
saecular
soul
it
took
majesty
and
loveliness
from
the
walls
around
it
and
rendered
them
again
tenfold
it
left
nothing
common
neither
the
motives
nor
the
littleness
of
men
in
priam
mind
it
gave
dignity
to
lady
sophia
entwistle
and
profound
tragedy
to
the
death
of
leek
it
transformed
even
the
gestures
of
the
into
grave
commands
and
all
that
was
for
him
he
had
brushed
pigments
on
to
cloth
in
a
way
of
his
own
nothing
more
and
the
nation
to
which
he
had
always
denied
artistic
perceptions
the
nation
which
he
had
always
fiercely
accused
of
sentimentality
was
thus
solemnizing
his
committal
to
the
earth
divine
mystery
of
art
the
large
magnificence
of
england
smote
him
he
had
not
suspected
his
own
greatness
nor
england
the
music
ceased
he
chanced
to
look
up
at
the
little
glooming
window
perched
out
of
reach
of
mankind
and
the
thought
that
the
window
had
burned
there
patiently
and
unexpectantly
for
hundreds
of
years
like
an
anchorite
above
the
river
and
town
somehow
disturbed
him
so
that
he
could
not
continue
to
look
at
it
ineffable
sadness
of
a
mere
window
and
his
eye
fell
fell
on
the
coffin
of
henry
leek
with
its
white
cross
and
the
representative
of
england
majesty
standing
beside
it
and
there
was
the
end
of
priam
farll
a
pang
like
a
pang
of
parturition
itself
seized
him
and
an
issuing
sob
nearly
ripped
him
in
two
it
was
a
loud
sob
undisguised
unashamed
reverberating
other
sobs
succeeded
it
priam
farll
was
in
torture
new
the
organist
vaulted
over
his
seat
shocked
by
the
outrage
you
really
must
make
that
noise
whispered
the
organist
priam
farll
shook
him
off
the
organist
was
apparently
at
a
loss
what
to
do
who
is
it
whispered
one
of
the
young
men
do
know
him
from
adam
said
the
organist
with
conviction
and
then
to
priam
farll
who
are
you
you
no
right
to
be
here
who
gave
you
permission
to
come
up
here
and
the
rending
sobs
continued
to
issue
from
the
ridiculous
man
of
fifty
utterly
careless
of
decorum
it
perfectly
absurd
whispered
the
youngster
who
had
whispered
before
there
had
been
a
silence
in
the
choir
here
they
waiting
for
you
whispered
the
other
young
man
excitedly
to
the
organist
by
whispered
the
alarmed
organist
not
stopping
to
say
by
what
but
leaping
like
an
acrobat
back
to
his
seat
his
fingers
and
boots
were
at
work
instantly
and
as
he
played
he
turned
his
head
and
whispered
better
fetch
some
one
one
of
the
young
men
crept
quickly
and
creakingly
down
the
stairs
fortunately
the
organ
and
choristers
were
now
combined
to
overcome
the
sobbing
and
they
succeeded
presently
a
powerful
arm
hidden
under
a
black
cassock
was
laid
on
priam
shoulder
he
hysterically
tried
to
free
himself
but
he
could
not
the
cassock
and
the
two
young
men
thrust
him
downwards
they
all
descended
together
partly
walking
and
partly
falling
and
then
a
door
was
opened
and
priam
discovered
himself
in
the
unroofed
air
of
the
cloisters
without
his
hat
and
breathing
in
gasps
his
executioners
were
also
breathing
in
gasps
they
glared
at
him
in
triumphant
menace
as
though
they
had
done
something
which
indeed
they
had
and
as
though
they
meant
to
do
something
more
but
could
not
quite
decide
what
where
your
ticket
of
admission
demanded
the
cassock
priam
fumbled
for
it
and
could
not
find
it
i
must
have
lost
it
he
said
weakly
what
your
name
anyhow
priam
farll
said
priam
farll
without
thinking
off
his
nut
evidently
murmured
one
of
the
young
men
contemptuously
come
on
stan
do
let
miss
that
anthem
for
this
cuss
and
off
they
both
went
then
a
youthful
policeman
appeared
putting
on
his
helmet
as
he
quitted
the
fane
what
all
this
asked
the
policeman
in
the
assured
tone
of
one
who
had
the
forces
of
the
empire
behind
him
he
been
making
a
disturbance
in
the
horgan
loft
said
the
cassock
and
now
he
says
his
name
priam
farll
oh
said
the
policeman
ho
and
how
did
he
get
into
the
organ
loft
do
arsk
me
answered
the
cassock
he
ai
got
no
ticket
now
then
out
of
it
said
the
policeman
taking
zealously
hold
of
priam
i
thank
you
to
leave
me
alone
said
priam
rebelling
with
all
the
pride
of
his
nature
against
this
clutch
of
the
law
oh
you
will
will
you
said
the
policeman
we
see
about
that
we
shall
just
see
about
that
and
the
policeman
dragged
priam
along
the
cloister
to
the
muffled
music
of
he
will
swallow
up
death
in
victory
they
had
not
thus
proceeded
very
far
when
they
met
another
policeman
an
older
policeman
what
all
this
demanded
the
older
policeman
drunk
and
disorderly
in
the
abbey
said
the
younger
will
you
come
quietly
the
older
policeman
asked
priam
with
a
touch
of
commiseration
i
not
drunk
said
priam
fiercely
he
was
unversed
in
london
and
unaware
of
the
foolishness
of
reasoning
with
the
of
justice
will
you
come
quietly
the
older
policeman
repeated
this
time
without
any
touch
of
commiseration
yes
said
priam
and
he
went
quietly
experience
may
teach
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
but
where
my
hat
he
added
after
a
moment
instinctively
stopping
now
then
said
the
older
policeman
come
he
walked
between
them
striding
just
as
they
emerged
into
dean
yard
his
left
hand
nervously
exploring
one
of
his
pockets
on
a
sudden
encountered
a
piece
of
cardboard
here
my
ticket
he
said
i
thought
i
lost
it
i
had
nothing
at
all
to
drink
and
you
better
let
me
go
the
whole
affair
a
mistake
the
procession
halted
while
the
older
policeman
gazed
fascinated
at
the
official
document
henry
leek
he
read
deciphering
the
name
he
been
every
one
as
he
priam
farll
grumbled
the
younger
policeman
looking
over
the
other
shoulder
i
done
no
such
thing
said
priam
promptly
the
elder
carefully
inspected
the
prisoner
and
two
little
boys
arrived
and
formed
a
crowd
which
was
immediately
dispersed
by
a
frown
he
do
look
as
if
he
had
as
much
drink
as
wash
a
bus
does
he
murmured
the
elder
critically
the
younger
afraid
of
his
senior
said
nothing
look
here
henry
leek
the
elder
proceeded
do
you
know
what
i
should
do
if
i
was
you
i
should
go
and
buy
myself
a
new
hat
if
i
was
you
and
quick
too
priam
hastened
away
and
heard
the
senior
say
to
the
junior
he
a
toff
that
what
he
is
and
you
a
fool
have
you
forgotten
as
on
point
duty
and
such
is
the
effect
of
a
suggestion
given
under
certain
circumstances
by
a
man
of
authority
that
priam
farll
went
straight
along
victoria
street
and
at
sowter
famous
did
in
fact
buy
himself
a
new
hat
he
then
hailed
a
taximeter
from
the
stand
opposite
the
army
and
navy
stores
and
curtly
gave
the
address
of
the
grand
babylon
hotel
and
when
the
cab
was
fairly
at
speed
and
not
before
he
abandoned
himself
to
a
fit
of
candid
unrestrained
cursing
he
cursed
largely
and
variously
and
shamelessly
both
in
english
and
in
french
and
he
did
not
cease
cursing
it
was
a
reaction
which
i
do
not
care
to
characterize
but
i
will
not
conceal
that
it
occurred
the
fit
spent
itself
before
he
reached
the
hotel
for
most
of
parliament
street
was
blocked
for
the
spectacular
purposes
of
his
funeral
and
his
driver
had
to
seek
devious
ways
the
cursing
over
he
began
to
smooth
his
plumes
in
detail
at
the
hotel
out
of
sheer
nervousness
he
gave
the
cabman
which
was
preposterous
another
cab
drove
up
nearly
at
the
exact
instant
of
his
arrival
and
as
a
capping
to
the
day
alice
challice
stepped
out
of
it
chapter
v
on
she
was
wearing
the
same
red
roses
oh
she
said
very
quickly
pouring
out
the
words
generously
from
the
inexhaustible
mine
of
her
good
heart
i
so
sorry
i
missed
you
saturday
night
i
ca
tell
you
how
sorry
i
am
of
course
it
was
all
my
fault
i
ought
to
have
got
into
the
lift
without
you
i
ought
to
have
waited
when
i
was
in
the
lift
i
wanted
to
get
out
but
the
was
too
quick
for
me
and
then
on
the
platforms
well
there
was
such
a
crowd
it
was
useless
i
knew
it
was
useless
and
you
not
having
my
address
either
i
wondered
whatever
you
would
think
of
me
my
dear
lady
he
protested
i
can
assure
you
i
blamed
only
myself
my
hat
blew
off
and
did
it
now
she
took
him
up
breathlessly
well
all
i
want
you
to
understand
really
is
that
i
not
one
of
those
silly
sort
of
women
that
go
losing
themselves
no
such
a
thing
never
happened
to
me
before
and
i
shall
take
good
care
she
glanced
round
he
had
paid
both
the
cabmen
who
were
departing
and
he
and
alice
challice
stood
under
the
immense
glass
portico
of
the
grand
babylon
exposed
to
the
raking
stare
of
two
commissionaires
so
you
staying
here
she
said
as
if
laying
hold
of
a
fact
which
she
had
hitherto
hesitated
to
touch
yes
he
said
wo
you
come
in
he
took
her
into
the
rich
gloom
of
the
grand
babylon
dashingly
fighting
against
the
demon
of
shyness
and
beating
it
off
with
great
loss
they
sat
down
in
a
corner
of
the
principal
foyer
where
a
few
electric
lights
drew
attention
to
empty
fauteuils
and
the
blossoms
on
the
aubusson
carpet
the
world
was
at
lunch
and
a
fine
time
i
had
getting
your
address
said
she
of
course
i
wrote
at
once
to
selwood
terrace
as
soon
as
i
got
home
but
i
had
the
wrong
number
somehow
and
i
kept
waiting
and
waiting
for
an
answer
and
the
only
answer
i
received
was
the
returned
letter
i
knew
i
got
the
street
right
and
i
said
find
that
house
if
i
have
to
ring
every
bell
in
selwood
terrace
yes
and
knock
every
knocker
well
i
did
find
it
and
then
they
would
me
your
address
they
said
would
be
forwarded
if
you
please
but
i
was
going
to
have
any
more
letter
business
no
thank
you
so
i
said
i
would
go
without
the
address
it
was
duncan
farll
clerk
that
i
saw
he
living
there
for
the
time
being
a
very
nice
young
man
we
got
quite
friendly
it
seems
duncan
farll
in
a
state
when
he
found
the
will
the
young
man
did
say
that
he
broke
a
typewriter
all
to
pieces
but
the
funeral
being
in
westminster
abbey
consoled
him
it
would
have
consoled
me
no
not
it
however
he
very
rich
himself
so
that
does
matter
the
young
man
said
if
i
call
again
he
ask
his
master
if
he
might
give
me
your
address
a
rare
fuss
over
an
address
thought
i
to
myself
but
there
lawyers
so
i
called
again
and
he
gave
it
me
i
could
have
come
yesterday
i
very
nearly
wrote
last
night
but
i
thought
on
the
whole
i
better
wait
till
the
funeral
was
over
i
thought
it
would
be
nicer
it
over
now
i
suppose
yes
said
priam
farll
she
smiled
at
him
with
grave
sympathy
comfortably
and
sensibly
and
right
down
relieved
you
must
be
she
murmured
it
must
have
been
very
trying
for
you
in
a
way
he
answered
hesitatingly
it
was
taking
off
her
gloves
she
glanced
round
about
her
as
a
thief
must
glance
before
opening
the
door
and
then
leaning
suddenly
towards
him
she
put
her
hands
to
his
neck
and
touched
his
collar
no
no
she
said
let
me
do
it
i
can
do
it
there
no
one
looking
unbuttoned
the
necktie
was
holding
it
in
place
but
it
got
quite
loose
now
there
i
can
do
it
i
see
you
got
two
funny
moles
on
your
neck
close
together
how
lucky
that
it
a
final
pat
now
no
woman
had
ever
patted
priam
farll
necktie
before
much
less
buttoned
his
collar
and
still
much
less
referred
to
the
two
little
moles
one
hirsute
the
other
hairless
which
the
collar
hid
when
it
was
properly
buttoned
the
experience
was
startling
for
him
in
the
extreme
it
might
have
made
him
very
angry
had
the
hands
of
challice
not
been
well
nurse
hands
soft
hands
persuasive
hands
hands
that
could
practise
impossible
audacities
with
impunity
imagine
a
woman
uninvited
and
unpermitted
arranging
his
collar
and
necktie
for
him
in
the
largest
public
room
of
the
grand
babylon
and
then
talking
about
his
little
moles
it
would
have
been
unimaginable
yet
it
happened
and
moreover
he
had
not
disliked
it
she
sat
back
in
her
chair
as
though
she
had
done
nothing
in
the
least
degree
unusual
i
can
see
you
must
have
been
very
upset
she
said
gently
though
he
only
left
you
a
pound
a
week
still
that
better
than
a
bat
in
the
eye
with
a
burnt
stick
a
bat
in
the
eye
with
a
burnt
stick
reminded
him
vaguely
of
encounters
with
the
police
otherwise
it
conveyed
no
meaning
to
his
mind
i
hope
you
have
got
to
go
on
duty
at
once
she
said
after
a
pause
because
you
really
do
look
as
if
you
needed
a
rest
and
a
cup
of
tea
or
something
of
that
i
quite
ashamed
to
have
come
bothering
you
so
soon
duty
he
questioned
what
duty
why
she
exclaimed
have
you
got
a
new
place
new
place
he
repeated
after
what
do
you
mean
why
as
valet
there
was
certainly
danger
in
his
tendency
to
forget
that
he
was
a
valet
he
collected
himself
no
he
said
i
have
got
a
new
place
then
why
are
you
staying
here
she
cried
i
thought
you
were
simply
here
with
a
new
master
why
are
you
staying
here
alone
oh
he
replied
abashed
it
seemed
a
convenient
place
it
was
just
by
chance
that
i
came
here
convenient
place
indeed
she
said
stoutly
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
he
perceived
that
he
had
shocked
her
pained
her
he
saw
that
some
ingenious
defence
of
himself
was
required
but
he
could
find
none
so
he
said
in
his
confusion
suppose
we
go
and
have
something
to
eat
i
do
want
a
bit
of
lunch
as
you
say
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
will
you
what
here
she
demanded
apprehensively
yes
he
said
why
not
well
come
along
he
said
with
fine
casualness
and
conducted
her
to
the
eight
swinging
glass
doors
that
led
to
the
à
of
the
grand
babylon
at
each
pair
of
doors
was
a
living
statue
of
dignity
in
cloth
of
gold
she
passed
these
statues
without
a
sign
of
fear
but
when
she
saw
the
room
itself
steeped
in
a
calm
full
of
gowns
and
hats
and
everything
that
you
read
about
in
the
pictorial
and
the
pennoned
mast
of
a
barge
crossing
the
windows
at
the
other
end
she
stopped
suddenly
and
one
of
the
lord
mayors
of
the
grand
babylon
wearing
a
mayoral
chain
who
had
started
out
to
meet
them
stopped
also
no
she
said
i
do
feel
as
if
i
could
eat
here
i
really
could
but
why
well
she
said
i
could
fancy
it
somehow
ca
we
go
somewhere
else
certainly
we
can
he
agreed
with
an
eagerness
that
was
more
than
polite
she
thanked
him
with
another
of
her
comfortable
sensible
smiles
a
smile
that
took
all
embarrassment
out
of
the
dilemma
as
balm
will
take
irritation
from
a
wound
and
gently
she
removed
her
hat
and
gown
and
her
gestures
and
speech
and
her
comfortableness
from
those
august
precincts
and
they
descended
to
the
which
was
relatively
noisy
and
where
her
roses
were
less
conspicuous
than
the
helmet
of
navarre
and
her
frock
found
its
sisters
and
cousins
from
far
lands
i
not
much
for
these
restaurants
she
said
over
grilled
kidneys
no
he
responded
tentatively
i
sorry
i
thought
the
other
night
oh
yes
she
broke
in
i
was
very
glad
to
go
the
other
night
to
that
place
very
glad
but
you
see
i
never
been
in
a
restaurant
before
really
no
she
said
and
i
felt
as
if
i
should
like
to
try
one
and
the
young
lady
at
the
post
office
had
told
me
that
one
was
a
splendid
one
so
it
is
it
beautiful
but
of
course
they
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
offer
you
such
food
now
do
you
remember
that
sole
sole
it
was
no
more
sole
than
this
glove
sole
and
if
it
had
been
cooked
a
minute
it
had
been
cooked
an
hour
and
waiting
and
then
look
at
the
prices
oh
yes
i
could
help
seeing
the
bill
i
thought
it
was
awfully
cheap
said
he
well
did
said
she
when
you
think
that
a
good
housekeeper
can
keep
everything
going
on
ten
shillings
a
head
a
why
simply
scandalous
and
i
suppose
this
place
is
even
dearer
he
avoided
the
question
this
is
a
better
place
altogether
he
said
in
fact
i
do
know
many
places
in
europe
where
one
can
eat
better
than
one
does
here
do
you
she
said
indulgently
as
if
saying
well
i
know
one
at
any
rate
they
say
he
continued
that
there
is
no
butter
used
in
this
place
that
costs
less
than
three
shillings
a
pound
butter
costs
them
three
shillings
a
pound
said
she
not
in
london
said
he
they
have
it
from
paris
and
do
you
believe
that
she
asked
yes
he
said
well
i
do
any
one
that
pays
more
than
a
pound
for
butter
the
is
a
fool
if
you
excuse
me
saying
the
word
not
but
what
this
is
good
butter
i
could
get
as
good
in
putney
for
less
than
eighteen
pence
she
made
him
feel
like
a
child
who
has
a
great
deal
to
pick
up
from
a
kindly
but
firm
sister
no
thank
you
she
said
a
little
dryly
to
the
waiter
who
proffered
a
further
supply
of
chip
potatoes
now
do
say
they
cold
priam
laughed
and
she
laughed
also
shall
i
tell
you
one
thing
that
puts
me
against
these
restaurants
she
went
on
it
the
feeling
you
have
that
you
do
know
where
the
food
when
you
got
your
kitchen
close
to
your
and
you
can
keep
an
eye
on
the
stuff
from
the
moment
the
cart
brings
it
well
then
you
do
know
a
bit
where
you
are
and
you
can
have
your
dishes
served
hot
it
stands
to
reason
she
said
where
is
the
kitchen
here
somewhere
down
below
he
replied
apologetically
a
cellar
kitchen
she
exclaimed
why
in
putney
they
simply
ca
let
houses
with
cellar
kitchens
no
no
restaurants
and
hotels
for
me
not
for
that
is
regularly
still
he
said
with
a
judicial
air
hotels
are
very
convenient
are
they
she
said
meaning
prove
it
for
instance
here
there
a
telephone
in
every
room
you
do
mean
in
the
bedrooms
yes
in
every
bedroom
well
she
said
you
would
catch
me
having
a
telephone
in
my
bedroom
i
should
never
sleep
if
i
knew
there
was
a
telephone
in
the
room
fancy
being
forced
to
telephone
every
time
you
want
well
i
and
how
is
one
to
know
who
there
is
at
the
other
end
of
the
telephone
no
i
do
like
that
all
that
all
very
well
for
gentlemen
that
been
used
to
what
i
call
in
a
way
of
speaking
but
he
saw
that
if
he
persisted
nothing
soon
would
be
left
of
that
noble
pile
the
grand
babylon
hotel
save
a
heap
of
ruins
and
further
she
genuinely
did
cause
him
to
feel
that
throughout
his
career
he
had
always
missed
the
very
best
things
of
life
through
being
an
uncherished
ingenuous
easily
satisfied
man
a
new
sensation
for
him
for
if
any
male
in
europe
believed
in
his
own
capacity
to
make
others
make
him
comfortable
priam
farll
was
that
male
i
never
been
in
putney
he
ventured
on
a
new
track
of
as
she
informed
him
with
an
ungrudging
particularity
about
putney
and
her
life
at
putney
there
gradually
arose
in
his
brain
a
vision
of
a
kind
of
existence
such
as
he
had
never
encountered
putney
had
clearly
the
advantages
of
a
residential
town
in
a
magnificent
situation
it
lay
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
whose
foot
was
washed
by
a
glorious
stream
entitled
the
thames
its
breast
covered
with
picturesque
barges
and
ornamental
rowing
boats
an
arched
bridge
spanned
this
stream
and
you
went
over
the
bridge
in
omnibuses
to
london
putney
had
a
street
of
handsome
shops
a
purely
business
street
no
one
slept
there
now
because
of
the
noise
of
motors
at
eventide
the
street
glittered
in
its
own
splendours
there
were
theatre
concert
hall
market
brewery
library
and
an
afternoon
tea
shop
exactly
like
regent
street
not
that
challice
cared
for
their
alleged
china
tea
also
churches
and
chapels
and
barnes
common
if
you
walked
one
way
and
wimbledon
common
if
you
walked
another
challice
lived
in
werter
road
werter
road
starting
conveniently
at
the
corner
of
the
high
street
where
the
was
an
establishment
where
authentic
sole
was
always
obtainable
though
it
was
advisable
not
to
buy
it
on
monday
mornings
of
course
putney
was
a
place
where
you
lived
unvexed
untroubled
you
had
your
little
house
and
your
furniture
and
your
ability
to
look
after
yourself
at
all
ends
and
your
knowledge
of
the
prices
of
everything
and
your
deep
knowledge
of
human
nature
and
your
experienced
forgivingness
towards
human
frailties
you
did
not
keep
a
servant
because
servants
were
so
complicated
and
because
they
could
do
nothing
whatever
as
well
as
you
could
do
it
yourself
you
had
a
charwoman
when
you
felt
idle
or
when
you
chose
to
put
the
house
into
the
for
an
airing
with
the
charwoman
a
pair
of
gloves
for
coarser
work
and
gas
stoves
you
naught
of
domestic
labour
you
were
never
worried
by
ambitions
or
by
envy
or
by
the
desire
to
know
precisely
what
the
wealthy
did
and
to
do
likewise
you
read
when
you
were
not
more
amusingly
occupied
preferring
illustrated
papers
and
magazines
you
did
not
traffic
with
art
to
any
appreciable
extent
and
you
never
dreamed
of
letting
it
keep
you
awake
at
night
you
were
rich
for
the
reason
that
you
spent
less
than
you
received
you
never
speculated
about
the
ultimate
causes
of
things
or
puzzled
yourself
concerning
the
possible
developments
of
society
in
the
next
hundred
years
when
you
saw
a
poor
old
creature
in
the
street
you
bought
a
box
of
matches
off
the
poor
old
creature
the
social
phenomenon
which
chiefly
roused
you
to
just
anger
was
the
spectacle
of
wealthy
people
making
money
and
so
taking
the
bread
out
of
the
mouths
of
people
who
needed
it
the
only
apparent
blots
on
existence
at
putney
were
the
noise
and
danger
of
the
high
street
the
dearth
of
reliable
laundries
the
manners
of
a
lady
engaged
at
the
post
office
challice
liked
the
other
ladies
in
the
post
office
and
the
absence
of
a
suitable
man
in
the
house
existence
at
putney
seemed
to
priam
farll
to
approach
the
utopian
it
seemed
to
breathe
of
romance
the
romance
of
common
sense
and
kindliness
and
simplicity
it
made
his
own
existence
to
that
day
appear
a
futile
and
unhappy
striving
after
the
impossible
art
what
was
it
what
did
it
lead
to
he
was
sick
of
art
and
sick
of
all
the
forms
of
activity
to
which
he
had
hitherto
been
accustomed
and
which
he
had
mistaken
for
life
itself
one
little
home
fixed
and
stable
rendered
foolish
the
whole
concourse
of
european
hotels
i
suppose
you
wo
be
staying
here
long
demanded
challice
oh
no
he
said
i
shall
decide
something
shall
you
take
another
place
she
inquired
another
place
yes
her
smile
was
excessively
persuasive
and
inviting
i
do
know
he
said
diffidently
you
must
have
put
a
good
bit
by
she
said
still
with
the
same
smile
or
perhaps
you
have
saving
a
matter
of
chance
that
what
i
always
do
say
it
just
depends
how
you
begin
it
a
habit
i
never
really
blame
anybody
for
not
saving
and
men
she
seemed
to
wish
to
indicate
that
men
were
specially
to
be
excused
if
they
did
not
save
she
had
a
large
mind
that
was
sure
she
understood
things
and
human
nature
in
particular
she
was
not
one
of
those
creatures
that
a
man
meets
with
sometimes
creatures
who
are
for
ever
on
the
watch
to
pounce
and
who
are
incapable
of
making
allowances
for
any
male
frailty
smooth
smiling
creatures
with
thin
lips
hair
a
little
scanty
at
the
front
and
a
quietly
omniscient
tone
alice
challice
had
a
mouth
as
wide
as
her
ideas
and
a
full
underlip
she
was
a
woman
who
as
it
were
ran
out
to
meet
you
when
you
started
to
cross
the
dangerous
roadway
which
separates
the
two
sexes
she
comprehended
because
she
wanted
to
comprehend
and
when
she
could
not
comprehend
she
would
deceive
herself
that
she
did
which
amounts
to
the
equivalent
she
was
a
living
proof
that
in
her
sex
social
distinctions
do
not
effectively
count
nothing
counted
where
she
was
concerned
except
a
distinction
far
more
profound
than
any
social
distinction
the
historic
distinction
between
adam
and
eve
she
was
balm
to
priam
farll
she
might
have
been
equally
balm
to
king
david
uriah
the
hittite
socrates
rousseau
lord
byron
heine
or
charlie
peace
she
would
have
understood
them
all
they
would
all
have
been
ready
to
cushion
themselves
on
her
comfortableness
was
she
a
lady
pish
she
was
a
woman
her
temperament
drew
priam
farll
like
an
electrified
magnet
to
wander
about
freely
in
that
roomy
sympathy
of
hers
seemed
to
him
to
be
the
supreme
reward
of
experience
it
seemed
like
the
good
inn
after
the
bleak
the
oasis
after
the
sandstorm
shade
after
glare
the
dressing
after
the
wound
sleep
after
insomnia
surcease
from
unspeakable
torture
he
wanted
in
a
word
to
tell
her
everything
because
she
would
not
demand
any
difficult
explanations
she
had
given
him
an
opening
in
her
mention
of
savings
in
reply
to
her
suggestion
you
must
have
put
a
good
bit
by
he
could
casually
answer
yes
a
hundred
and
forty
thousand
pounds
and
that
would
lead
by
natural
stages
to
a
complete
revealing
of
the
fix
in
which
he
was
in
five
minutes
he
would
have
confided
to
her
the
principal
details
and
she
would
have
understood
and
then
he
could
describe
his
agonizing
and
humiliating
in
the
abbey
and
she
would
pour
her
magic
oil
on
that
dreadful
abrasion
of
his
sensitiveness
and
he
would
be
healed
of
his
hurts
and
they
would
settle
between
them
what
he
ought
to
do
he
regarded
her
as
his
refuge
as
fate
generous
compensation
to
him
for
the
loss
of
henry
leek
whose
remains
now
rested
in
the
national
valhalla
only
it
would
be
necessary
to
begin
the
explanation
so
that
one
thing
might
by
natural
stages
lead
to
another
on
reflection
it
appeared
rather
abrupt
to
say
yes
a
hundred
and
forty
thousand
pounds
the
sum
was
too
absurdly
high
though
correct
the
mischief
was
that
unless
the
sum
did
strike
her
as
absurdly
high
it
could
not
possibly
lead
by
a
natural
stage
to
the
remainder
of
the
explanation
he
must
contrive
another
path
for
instance
there
been
a
mistake
about
the
death
of
priam
farll
a
mistake
she
would
exclaim
all
ears
and
eyes
then
he
would
say
yes
priam
farll
is
really
dead
it
his
valet
that
dead
whereupon
she
would
burst
out
but
were
his
valet
whereupon
he
would
simply
shake
his
head
and
she
would
steam
forwards
then
who
are
you
whereupon
he
would
say
as
calmly
as
he
could
i
priam
farll
i
tell
you
precisely
how
it
all
happened
thus
the
talk
might
happen
thus
it
would
happen
immediately
he
began
but
as
at
the
dean
door
in
dean
yard
so
now
he
could
not
begin
he
could
not
utter
the
necessary
words
aloud
spoken
aloud
they
would
sound
ridiculous
incredible
insane
and
not
even
challice
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
grasp
their
import
much
less
believe
them
been
a
mistake
about
the
death
of
priam
a
hundred
and
forty
thousand
no
he
could
enunciate
neither
the
one
sentence
nor
the
other
there
are
some
truths
so
bizarre
that
they
make
you
feel
and
guilty
before
you
have
begun
to
state
them
you
state
them
apologetically
you
blush
you
stammer
you
have
all
the
air
of
one
who
does
not
expect
belief
you
look
a
fool
you
feel
a
fool
and
you
bring
disaster
on
yourself
he
perceived
with
the
most
painful
clearness
that
he
could
never
never
impart
to
her
the
terrific
secret
the
awful
truth
great
as
she
was
the
truth
was
greater
and
she
would
never
be
able
to
swallow
it
what
time
is
it
she
asked
suddenly
oh
you
must
think
about
time
he
said
with
hasty
concern
of
when
the
lunch
was
completely
finished
and
the
had
so
far
emptied
that
it
was
inhabited
by
no
one
except
themselves
and
several
waiters
who
were
trying
to
force
them
to
depart
by
means
of
thought
transference
and
uneasy
hovering
round
their
table
priam
farll
began
to
worry
his
brains
in
order
to
find
some
sane
way
of
spending
the
afternoon
in
her
society
he
wanted
to
keep
her
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
keep
her
he
was
quite
at
a
loss
strange
that
a
man
great
enough
and
brilliant
enough
to
get
buried
in
westminster
abbey
had
not
sufficient
of
the
small
change
of
cleverness
to
retain
the
company
of
a
alice
challice
yet
so
it
was
happily
he
was
buoyed
up
by
the
thought
that
she
understood
i
must
be
moving
off
home
she
said
putting
her
gloves
on
slowly
and
sighed
let
me
see
he
stammered
i
think
you
said
werter
road
putney
yes
no
perhaps
you
let
me
call
on
you
he
ventured
oh
do
she
encouraged
him
nothing
could
have
been
more
correct
and
nothing
more
banal
than
this
part
of
their
conversation
he
certainly
would
call
he
would
travel
down
to
the
idyllic
putney
he
could
not
lose
such
a
friend
such
a
balm
such
a
soft
cushion
such
a
comprehending
intelligence
he
would
bit
by
bit
become
intimate
with
her
and
perhaps
ultimately
he
might
arrive
at
the
stage
of
being
able
to
tell
her
who
he
was
with
some
chance
of
being
believed
anyhow
when
he
did
call
and
he
insisted
to
himself
that
it
should
be
extremely
soon
he
would
try
another
plan
with
her
he
would
carefully
decide
beforehand
just
what
to
say
and
how
to
say
it
this
decision
reconciled
him
somewhat
to
a
temporary
parting
from
her
so
he
paid
the
bill
under
her
sagacious
protesting
eyes
and
he
managed
to
conceal
from
those
eyes
the
precise
amount
of
the
tip
and
then
at
the
he
furtively
gave
sixpence
to
a
fat
and
wealthy
man
who
had
been
watching
over
his
hat
and
stick
highly
curious
how
those
orbs
of
hers
made
all
such
operations
seem
excessively
silly
and
at
last
they
wandered
in
silence
through
the
corridors
and
antechambers
that
led
to
the
courtyard
entrance
and
through
the
glass
portals
priam
farll
had
a
momentary
glimpse
of
the
reflection
of
light
on
a
cabman
wet
macintosh
it
was
raining
it
was
raining
very
heavily
indeed
all
was
dry
under
the
colonnades
of
the
courtyard
but
the
rain
rattled
like
kettledrums
on
that
glass
and
the
centre
of
the
courtyard
was
a
pond
in
which
a
few
hansoms
were
splashing
about
everything
the
horses
coats
the
cabmen
hats
and
capes
and
the
cabmen
red
faces
shone
and
streamed
in
the
torrential
summer
rain
it
is
said
that
geography
makes
history
in
england
and
especially
in
london
weather
makes
a
good
deal
of
history
impossible
to
brave
that
rain
except
under
the
severest
pressure
of
necessity
they
were
in
shelter
and
in
shelter
they
must
remain
he
was
glad
absurdly
and
splendidly
glad
it
ca
last
long
she
said
looking
up
at
the
black
sky
which
showed
an
edge
towards
the
east
suppose
we
go
in
again
and
have
some
tea
he
said
now
they
had
barely
concluded
coffee
but
she
did
not
seem
to
mind
well
she
said
it
always
for
he
saw
a
clock
it
nearly
four
he
said
thus
justified
of
the
clock
in
they
went
and
sat
down
in
the
same
seats
which
they
had
occupied
at
the
commencement
of
the
adventure
in
the
main
lounge
priam
discovered
a
and
commanded
china
tea
and
muffins
he
felt
that
he
now
as
it
were
had
an
opportunity
of
making
a
fresh
start
in
life
he
grew
almost
gay
he
could
be
gay
without
sinning
against
decorum
for
challice
singular
tact
had
avoided
all
reference
to
deaths
and
funerals
and
in
the
pause
while
he
was
preparing
to
be
gay
attractive
and
in
fact
his
true
self
she
calmly
stirring
china
tea
shot
a
bolt
which
made
him
see
stars
it
seems
to
me
she
observed
that
we
might
go
farther
and
fare
worse
both
of
us
he
genuinely
did
not
catch
the
significance
of
it
in
the
first
instant
and
she
saw
that
he
did
not
oh
she
proceeded
benevolently
and
reassuringly
i
mean
it
i
not
gallivanting
about
i
mean
that
if
you
want
my
opinion
i
fancy
we
could
make
a
match
of
it
it
was
at
this
point
that
he
saw
stars
he
also
saw
a
faint
and
delicious
blush
on
her
face
whose
complexion
was
extraordinarily
fresh
and
tender
she
sipped
china
tea
holding
each
finger
wide
apart
from
the
others
he
had
forgotten
the
origin
of
their
acquaintance
forgotten
that
each
of
them
was
supposed
to
have
a
definite
aim
in
view
forgotten
that
it
was
with
a
purpose
that
they
had
exchanged
photographs
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
marriage
hung
over
him
like
a
sword
he
perceived
the
sword
now
heavy
and
sharp
and
suspended
by
a
thread
of
appalling
fragility
he
dodged
he
did
not
want
to
lose
her
never
to
see
her
again
but
he
dodged
i
could
think
he
began
and
stopped
of
course
it
a
very
awkward
situation
for
a
man
she
went
on
toying
with
muffin
i
can
quite
understand
how
you
feel
and
with
most
folks
you
be
right
there
very
few
women
that
can
judge
character
and
if
you
started
to
try
and
settle
something
at
once
they
just
set
you
down
as
a
wrong
but
i
not
like
that
i
do
expect
any
what
i
like
is
plain
sense
and
plain
dealing
we
both
want
to
get
married
so
it
would
be
silly
to
pretend
we
did
would
it
and
it
would
be
ridiculous
of
me
to
look
for
courting
and
a
proposal
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
just
as
if
i
never
seen
a
man
in
his
the
only
question
is
shall
we
suit
each
other
i
told
you
what
i
think
what
do
you
think
she
smiled
honestly
kindly
but
piercingly
what
could
he
say
what
would
you
have
said
you
being
a
man
it
is
easy
sitting
there
in
your
chair
with
no
alice
challice
in
front
of
you
to
invent
diplomatic
replies
but
conceive
yourself
in
place
besides
he
did
think
she
would
suit
him
and
most
positively
he
could
not
bear
the
prospect
of
seeing
her
pass
out
of
his
life
he
had
been
through
that
experience
once
when
his
hat
blew
off
in
the
tube
and
he
did
not
wish
to
repeat
it
of
course
you
got
no
she
said
reflectively
with
such
compassion
suppose
you
come
down
and
just
have
a
little
peep
at
mine
so
that
evening
a
suitably
paired
couple
chanced
into
the
at
the
corner
of
werter
road
and
bought
a
bit
of
sole
at
the
newspaper
shop
next
door
but
one
placards
said
impressive
scenes
at
westminster
abbey
farll
funeral
stately
pageant
great
painter
laid
to
rest
etc
chapter
vi
putney
except
that
there
was
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
it
was
just
as
though
he
had
died
and
gone
to
heaven
heaven
is
the
absence
of
worry
and
of
ambition
heaven
is
where
you
want
nothing
you
have
got
heaven
is
finality
and
this
was
finality
on
the
september
morning
after
the
honeymoon
and
the
settling
down
he
arose
leisurely
long
after
his
wife
and
putting
on
the
puce
which
alice
much
admired
he
opened
the
window
wider
and
surveyed
that
part
of
the
universe
which
was
comprised
in
werter
road
and
the
sky
above
a
sturdy
old
woman
was
coming
down
the
street
with
a
great
basket
of
assorted
flowers
he
took
an
immense
pleasure
in
the
sight
of
the
old
woman
the
sight
of
the
old
woman
thrilled
him
why
well
there
was
no
reason
except
that
she
was
vigorously
alive
a
part
of
the
magnificent
earth
all
life
gave
him
joy
all
life
was
beautiful
to
him
he
had
his
warm
bath
the
was
not
of
the
latest
convenience
but
alice
could
have
made
a
convenient
as
he
passed
to
and
fro
on
the
he
heard
the
calm
efficient
activities
below
stairs
she
was
busy
in
the
mornings
her
eyes
would
seem
to
say
to
him
now
between
my
uprising
and
please
do
depend
on
me
for
intellectual
or
moral
support
i
am
on
the
spot
but
i
am
also
at
the
wheel
and
must
not
be
disturbed
then
he
descended
fresh
as
a
boy
although
the
promontory
which
prevented
a
direct
vision
of
his
toes
showed
accretions
the
was
a
shrine
for
his
breakfast
she
served
it
herself
in
apron
promptly
on
his
arrival
eggs
toast
coffee
it
was
nothing
that
breakfast
and
yet
it
was
everything
no
breakfast
could
have
been
better
he
had
probably
eaten
about
fifteen
thousand
hotel
breakfasts
before
alice
taught
him
what
a
real
breakfast
was
after
serving
it
she
lingered
for
a
moment
and
then
handed
him
the
which
had
been
lying

she
said
cheerfully
tacitly
disowning
any
property
or
interest
in
the
for
her
newspapers
were
toys
she
never
opened
a
paper
never
wanted
to
know
what
was
going
on
in
the
world
she
was
always
intent
upon
her
own
affairs
politics
and
all
that
business
of
the
mere
machinery
of
living
she
perfectly
ignored
it
she
lived
she
did
nothing
but
live
she
lived
every
hour
priam
felt
truly
that
he
had
at
last
got
down
to
the
of
life
there
were
twenty
pages
of
the
far
more
matter
than
a
man
could
read
in
a
day
even
if
he
read
and
read
and
neither
ate
nor
slept
and
all
of
it
so
soothing
in
its
rich
variety
it
gently
lulled
you
it
was
the
ideal
companion
for
a
poached
egg
upstanding
against
the
it
stood
for
the
solidity
of
england
in
the
seas
priam
folded
it
large
he
read
all
the
articles
down
to
the
fold
then
turned
the
thing
over
and
finished
all
of
them
after
communing
with
the
he
communed
with
his
own
secret
nature
and
wandered
about
rolling
a
cigarette
ah
the
first
cigarette
his
wanderings
led
him
to
the
kitchen
or
at
least
as
far
as
the
threshold
thereof
his
wife
was
at
work
there
upon
every
handle
or
article
that
might
soil
she
put
soft
brown
paper
and
in
addition
she
often
wore
so
that
her
hands
remained
immaculate
thus
during
the
earlier
hours
of
the
day
the
house
especially
in
the
region
of
fireplaces
had
the
air
of
being
in
i
going
out
now
alice
he
said
after
he
had
drawn
on
his
finely
polished
boots
very
well
love
she
replied
preoccupied
with
her
work
lunch
as
usual
she
never
demanded
luxuriousness
from
him
she
had
got
him
she
was
sure
of
him
that
satisfied
her
sometimes
like
a
simple
woman
who
has
come
into
a
set
of
pearls
she
would
as
it
were
take
him
out
of
his
drawer
and
look
at
him
and
put
him
back
at
the
gate
he
hesitated
whether
to
turn
to
the
left
towards
high
street
or
to
the
right
towards
oxford
road
he
chose
the
right
but
he
would
have
enjoyed
himself
equally
had
he
chosen
the
left
the
streets
through
which
he
passed
were
populated
by
domestic
servants
and
tradesmen
boys
he
saw
girls
cleaning
or
windows
or
running
along
the
streets
like
escaped
nuns
or
staring
in
soft
meditation
from
bedroom
windows
and
the
tradesmen
boys
were
continually
leaping
in
and
out
of
carts
or
off
and
on
tricycles
busily
distributing
food
and
drink
as
though
putney
had
been
a
beleaguered
city
it
was
extremely
interesting
and
mysterious
and
what
made
it
the
most
mysterious
was
that
the
oligarchy
of
superior
persons
for
whom
these
boys
and
girls
so
assiduously
worked
remained
invisible
he
passed
a
newspaper
shop
and
found
his
customary
delight
in
the
placards
this
morning
the
announced
nothing
but
portrait
of
a
boy
aged
who
weighs
stone
and
the
whispered
in
scarlet
what
the
german
said
to
the
king
special
the
cried
surrey
glorious
finish
and
the
shouted
the
unwritten
law
in
the
united
states
another
scandal
not
for
gold
would
he
have
gone
behind
these
placards
to
the
organs
themselves
he
preferred
to
gather
from
the
placards
alone
what
wonders
of
yesterday
the
excellent
staid
had
unaccountably
missed
but
in
the
he
saw
cohoon
annual
meeting
stormy
scenes
and
he
bought
the
and
put
it
into
his
pocket
for
his
wife
because
she
had
an
interest
in
cohoon
brewery
and
he
conceived
the
possibility
of
her
caring
to
glance
at
the
report
simple
joy
of
after
crossing
the
railway
he
got
into
the
upper
richmond
road
a
thoroughfare
which
always
diverted
and
amused
him
it
was
such
a
street
of
contrasts
any
one
could
see
that
not
many
years
before
it
had
been
a
sacred
street
trod
only
by
feet
genteel
and
made
up
of
houses
each
christened
with
its
own
name
and
each
standing
in
its
own
garden
and
now
energetic
persons
had
put
churches
into
it
vast
red
things
with
gigantic
bells
and
large
drapery
shops
with
blouses
at
and
court
photographers
and
banks
and
and
auctioneers
offices
and
all
kinds
of
omnibuses
ran
along
it
and
yet
somehow
it
remained
meditative
and
superior
in
every
available
space
gigantic
posters
were
exhibited
they
all
had
to
do
with
food
or
pleasure
there
were
york
hams
eight
feet
high
that
a
regiment
could
not
have
eaten
in
a
month
shaggy
and
ferocious
oxen
peeping
out
of
monstrous
teacups
in
their
anxiety
to
be
consumed
spouting
bottles
of
ale
whose
froth
alone
would
have
floated
the
mail
steamers
pictured
on
an
adjoining
sheet
and
forty
different
decoctions
for
imparting
strength
then
after
a
few
score
yards
of
invitation
to
debauch
there
came
with
characteristic
admirable
english
common
sense
a
cure
for
indigestion
so
large
that
it
would
have
given
ease
to
a
mastodon
who
had
by
inadvertence
swallowed
an
elephant
and
then
there
were
the
calls
to
pleasure
astonishing
the
quantity
of
palaces
that
offered
you
exactly
the
same
entertainment
twice
over
on
the
same
night
astonishing
the
reliance
on
number
in
this
matter
of
amusement
authenticated
statements
that
a
certain
performer
had
done
a
certain
thing
in
a
certain
way
a
thousand
and
one
times
without
interruption
were
stuck
all
over
the
upper
richmond
road
apparently
in
the
sure
hope
that
you
would
rush
to
see
the
thousand
and
second
performance
these
performances
were
invariably
styled
original
and
novel
all
the
remainder
of
free
wall
space
was
occupied
by
philanthropists
who
were
ready
to
give
away
cigarettes
at
the
nominal
price
of
a
penny
a
packet
priam
farll
never
tired
of
the
phantasmagoria
of
upper
richmond
road
the
interminable
intermittent
vision
of
food
dead
and
alive
and
of
performers
performing
the
same
performance
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
and
of
millions
and
millions
of
cigarettes
ascending
from
the
mouths
of
handsome
young
men
in
incense
to
heaven
this
rare
vision
of
which
in
all
his
wanderings
he
had
never
seen
the
like
had
the
singular
effect
of
lulling
his
soul
into
a
profound
content
not
once
did
he
arrive
at
the
end
of
the
vision
no
when
he
reached
barnes
station
he
could
see
the
vision
still
stretching
on
and
on
but
filled
to
the
brim
he
would
get
into
an
omnibus
and
return
the
omnibus
awoke
him
to
other
issues
the
omnibus
was
an
antidote
in
the
omnibus
cleanliness
was
nigh
to
godliness
on
one
pane
a
soap
was
extolled
and
on
another
the
exordium
for
this
is
a
true
saying
and
worthy
of
all
acceptation
was
followed
by
the
statement
of
a
religious
dogma
while
on
another
pane
was
an
urgent
appeal
not
to
do
in
the
omnibus
what
you
would
not
do
in
a
yes
priam
farll
had
seen
the
world
but
he
had
never
seen
a
city
so
incredibly
strange
so
packed
with
curious
and
rare
psychological
interest
as
london
and
he
regretted
that
he
had
not
discovered
london
earlier
in
his
search
after
romance
at
the
corner
of
the
high
street
he
left
the
omnibus
and
stopped
a
moment
to
chat
with
his
tobacconist
his
tobacconist
was
a
stout
man
in
a
white
apron
who
stood
for
ever
behind
a
counter
and
sold
tobacco
to
the
most
respected
residents
of
putney
all
his
ideas
were
connected
either
with
tobacco
or
with
putney
a
murder
in
the
strand
to
that
tobacconist
was
less
than
the
breakdown
of
a
motor
bus
opposite
putney
station
and
a
change
of
government
less
than
a
change
of
programme
at
the
putney
empire
a
rather
pessimistic
tobacconist
not
inclined
to
believe
in
a
first
cause
until
one
day
a
drunken
man
smashed
salmon
and
gluckstein
window
down
the
high
street
whereupon
his
opinion
of
providence
went
up
for
several
days
priam
enjoyed
talking
to
him
though
the
tobacconist
was
utterly
impervious
to
ideas
and
never
gave
out
ideas
this
morning
the
tobacconist
was
at
his
door
at
the
other
corner
was
the
sturdy
old
woman
whom
priam
had
observed
from
his
window
she
sold
flowers
fine
old
woman
that
said
priam
heartily
after
he
and
the
tobacconist
had
agreed
upon
the
fact
that
it
was
a
glorious
morning
she
used
to
be
at
the
opposite
corner
by
the
station
until
last
may
but
one
when
the
police
shifted
her
said
the
tobacconist
why
did
the
police
shift
her
asked
priam
i
do
know
as
i
can
tell
you
said
the
tobacconist
but
i
remember
her
this
twelve
year
i
only
noticed
her
this
morning
said
priam
i
saw
her
from
my
bedroom
window
coming
down
the
werter
road
i
said
to
myself
the
finest
old
woman
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
did
you
now
murmured
the
tobacconist
she
rare
and
dirty
i
like
her
to
be
dirty
said
priam
stoutly
she
ought
to
be
dirty
she
would
be
the
same
if
she
were
clean
i
do
hold
with
dirt
said
the
tobacconist
calmly
she
be
better
if
she
had
a
bath
of
a
saturday
night
like
other
folks
well
said
priam
i
want
an
ounce
of
the
usual
thank
sir
said
the
tobacconist
putting
down
change
out
of
sixpence
as
priam
thanked
him
for
the
packet
nothing
whatever
in
such
a
dialogue
yet
priam
left
the
shop
with
a
distinct
feeling
that
life
was
good
and
he
plunged
into
high
street
lost
himself
in
crowds
of
perambulators
and
nice
womanly
women
who
were
bustling
honestly
about
in
search
of
food
or
raiment
many
of
them
carried
little
red
books
full
of
long
lists
of
things
which
they
and
their
admirers
and
the
offspring
of
mutual
affection
had
eaten
or
would
shortly
eat
in
the
high
street
all
was
luxury
not
a
necessary
in
the
street
even
the
bakers
shops
were
a
mass
of
sultana
and
berlin
pancakes
illuminated
calendars
gramophones
corsets
picture
postcards
manilla
cigars
chocolate
exotic
fruit
and
commodious
mansions
these
seemed
to
be
the
principal
objects
offered
for
sale
in
high
street
priam
bought
a
sixpenny
edition
of
herbert
spencer
for
and
passed
on
to
putney
bridge
whose
noble
arches
divided
a
first
storey
of
vans
and
omnibuses
from
a
of
barges
and
racing
eights
and
he
gazed
at
the
broad
river
and
its
hanging
gardens
and
dreamed
and
was
wakened
by
the
roar
of
an
electric
train
shooting
across
the
stream
on
a
red
causeway
a
few
yards
below
him
and
miles
off
he
could
descry
the
twin
towers
of
the
crystal
palace
more
marvellous
than
mosques
astounding
he
murmured
joyously
he
had
not
a
care
in
the
world
and
putney
was
all
that
alice
had
painted
it
in
due
time
when
bells
had
pealed
to
right
and
to
left
of
him
he
went
home
to
her
of
the
putney
now
just
at
the
end
of
lunch
over
the
last
stage
of
which
they
usually
sat
a
long
time
alice
got
up
quickly
in
the
midst
of
her
stilton
and
going
to
the
mantelpiece
took
a
letter
therefrom
i
wish
you
look
at
that
henry
she
said
handing
him
the
letter
it
came
this
morning
but
of
course
i
ca
be
bothered
with
that
sort
of
thing
in
the
morning
so
i
put
it
aside
he
accepted
the
letter
and
unfolded
it
with
the
professional
air
which
even
the
biggest
male
fool
will
quite
successfully
put
on
in
the
presence
of
a
woman
if
consulted
about
business
when
he
had
unfolded
the
thing
it
was
typed
on
stiff
expensive
quarto
paper
he
read
it
in
the
lives
of
beings
like
priam
farll
and
alice
a
letter
such
as
that
letter
is
a
terrible
event
unique
simple
recipients
are
apt
on
receiving
it
to
imagine
that
the
christian
era
has
come
to
an
end
but
tens
of
thousands
of
similar
letters
are
sent
out
from
the
city
every
day
and
the
city
thinks
nothing
of
them
the
letter
was
about
cohoon
brewery
company
limited
and
it
was
signed
by
a
firm
of
solicitors
it
referred
to
the
verbatim
report
which
it
said
would
be
found
in
the
financial
papers
of
the
annual
meeting
of
the
company
held
at
the
cannon
street
hotel
on
the
previous
day
and
to
the
exceedingly
unsatisfactory
nature
of
the
statement
it
regretted
the
absence
of
alice
challice
her
change
of
condition
had
not
yet
reached
the
heart
of
cohoon
from
the
meeting
and
asked
her
whether
she
would
be
prepared
to
support
the
action
of
a
committee
which
had
been
formed
to
eject
the
existing
board
and
which
had
already
a
following
of
votes
it
finished
by
asserting
that
unless
the
committee
was
immediately
lifted
to
absolute
power
the
company
would
be
quite
ruined
priam
the
letter
aloud
what
does
it
all
mean
asked
alice
quietly
well
said
he
that
what
it
means
does
it
mean
she
began
by
jove
he
exclaimed
i
forgot
i
saw
something
on
a
placard
this
morning
about
cohoon
and
i
thought
it
might
interest
you
so
i
bought
it
so
saying
he
drew
from
his
pocket
the
which
he
had
entirely
forgotten
there
it
was
a
column
and
a
quarter
of
the
chairman
speech
and
nearly
two
columns
of
stormy
scenes
the
chairman
was
the
marquis
of
drumgaldy
but
his
rank
had
apparently
not
shielded
him
from
the
violence
of
expletives
such
as
liar
humbug
and
even
rogue
the
marquis
had
merely
stated
with
every
formula
of
apology
that
owing
to
the
extraordinary
depreciation
in
licensed
property
the
directors
had
not
felt
justified
in
declaring
any
dividend
at
all
on
the
ordinary
shares
of
the
company
he
had
made
this
quite
simple
assertion
and
instantly
a
body
of
shareholders
less
reasonable
and
more
avaricious
even
than
shareholders
usually
are
had
begun
to
turn
the
historic
hall
of
the
cannon
street
hotel
into
a
bear
garden
one
might
have
imagined
that
the
sole
aim
of
brewery
companies
was
to
make
money
and
that
the
patriotism
of
brewers
that
patriotism
which
impelled
them
to
supply
an
honest
english
beer
to
the
honest
english
at
a
purely
nominal
price
was
scorned
and
forgotten
one
was
indeed
forced
to
imagine
this
in
vain
the
marquis
pointed
out
that
the
shareholders
had
received
a
fifteen
per
cent
dividend
for
years
and
years
past
and
that
really
for
once
in
a
way
they
ought
to
be
prepared
to
sacrifice
a
temporary
advantage
for
the
sake
of
future
prosperity
the
thought
of
those
regular
high
dividends
gave
rise
to
no
gratitude
in
shareholding
hearts
it
seemed
merely
to
render
them
the
more
furious
the
baser
passions
had
been
let
loose
in
the
cannon
street
hotel
the
directors
had
possibly
been
expecting
the
baser
passions
for
a
posse
of
policemen
was
handy
at
the
door
and
one
shareholder
to
save
him
from
having
the
blood
of
marquises
on
his
soul
was
ejected
ultimately
according
to
the
picturesque
phrases
of
the
report
the
meeting
broke
up
in
confusion
how
much
have
you
got
in
cohoon
priam
asked
alice
after
they
had
looked
through
the
report
together
all
i
have
is
in
cohoon
said
she
except
this
house
father
left
it
like
that
he
always
said
there
was
nothing
like
a
brewery
heard
him
say
many
and
many
a
time
a
brewery
was
better
than
consols
i
think
there
shares
yes
that
it
but
of
course
they
worth
much
more
than
that
they
worth
about
each
all
i
know
is
they
bring
me
in
a
year
as
regular
as
the
clock
what
that
there
after
up
in
confusion
she
pointed
with
her
finger
to
a
paragraph
and
he
read
in
a
low
voice
the
fluctuations
of
cohoon
ordinary
shares
during
the
afternoon
they
had
finished
at
henry
leek
had
lost
over
in
about
they
always
brought
me
in
a
year
she
insisted
as
though
she
had
been
saying
it
always
been
christmas
day
on
the
of
december
and
of
course
it
will
be
the
same
this
year
it
does
look
as
if
they
bring
you
in
anything
this
time
said
he
oh
but
henry
she
protested
beer
had
failed
that
was
the
truth
of
it
beer
had
failed
who
would
have
guessed
that
beer
could
fail
in
england
the
wisest
the
most
prudent
men
in
lombard
street
had
put
their
trust
in
beer
as
the
last
grand
bulwark
of
the
nation
and
even
beer
had
failed
the
foundations
of
england
greatness
were
if
not
gone
going
insufficient
to
argue
bad
management
indiscreet
purchases
of
licences
at
inflated
prices
in
the
excellent
old
days
a
brewery
would
stand
an
indefinite
amount
of
bad
management
times
were
changed
the
british
workman
caught
in
a
wave
of
temperance
could
no
longer
be
relied
upon
to
drink
it
was
the
crown
of
his
sins
against
society
trade
unions
were
nothing
to
this
latest
caprice
of
his
which
spread
desolation
in
a
thousand
genteel
homes
alice
wondered
what
her
father
would
have
said
had
he
lived
on
the
whole
she
was
glad
that
he
did
not
happen
to
be
alive
the
shock
to
him
would
have
been
too
rude
the
floor
seemed
to
be
giving
way
under
alice
melting
into
a
sort
of
bog
that
would
swallow
up
her
and
her
husband
for
years
without
any
precise
information
but
merely
by
instinct
she
had
felt
that
england
beneath
the
surface
was
not
quite
the
island
it
had
been
and
here
was
the
awful
proof
she
gazed
at
her
husband
as
a
wife
ought
to
gaze
at
her
husband
in
a
crisis
his
thoughts
were
much
vaguer
than
hers
his
thoughts
about
money
being
always
extremely
vague
suppose
you
went
up
to
the
city
and
saw
mr
she
suggested
meaning
the
signatory
of
the
letter
it
was
a
cry
of
the
soul
aghast
a
cry
drawn
out
of
him
sharply
by
a
most
genuine
cruel
alarm
him
to
go
up
to
the
city
to
interview
a
solicitor
why
the
poor
dear
woman
must
be
demented
he
could
not
have
done
it
for
a
million
pounds
the
thought
of
it
made
him
sick
raising
the
whole
of
his
lunch
to
his
throat
as
by
some
sinister
magic
she
saw
and
translated
the
look
on
his
face
it
was
a
look
of
horror
and
at
once
she
made
excuses
for
him
to
herself
at
once
she
said
to
herself
that
it
was
no
use
pretending
that
her
henry
was
like
other
men
he
was
not
he
was
a
dreamer
he
was
at
times
amazingly
peculiar
but
he
was
her
henry
in
any
other
man
than
her
henry
a
hesitation
to
take
charge
of
his
wife
financial
affairs
would
have
been
ridiculous
it
would
have
been
effeminate
but
henry
was
henry
she
was
gradually
learning
that
truth
he
was
adorable
but
he
was
henry
with
magnificent
strength
of
mind
she
collected
herself
no
she
said
cheerfully
as
they
my
shares
perhaps
i
better
go
unless
we
go
she
encountered
his
eye
again
and
added
quietly
no
i
go
alone
he
sighed
his
relief
he
could
not
help
sighing
his
relief
and
after
meticulously
and
straightening
she
departed
and
priam
remained
solitary
with
his
ideas
about
married
life
and
the
fiscal
question
alice
was
assuredly
the
very
mirror
of
discretion
never
since
that
unanswered
query
as
to
savings
at
the
grand
babylon
had
she
subjected
him
to
any
inquisition
concerning
money
never
had
she
talked
of
her
own
means
save
in
casual
phrase
now
and
then
to
assure
him
that
there
was
enough
she
had
indeed
refused
banknotes
diffidently
offered
to
her
by
him
telling
him
to
keep
them
by
him
till
need
of
them
arose
never
had
she
discoursed
of
her
own
past
life
nor
led
him
on
to
discourse
of
his
she
was
one
of
those
women
for
whom
neither
the
past
nor
the
future
seems
to
exist
they
are
always
so
occupied
with
the
important
present
he
and
she
had
both
of
them
relied
on
their
judgment
of
character
as
regarded
each
other
worthiness
and
trustworthiness
and
he
was
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
be
a
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
to
him
money
was
a
quite
uninteresting
token
that
had
to
pass
through
your
hands
he
had
always
had
enough
of
it
he
had
always
had
too
much
of
it
even
at
putney
he
had
had
too
much
of
it
the
better
part
of
henry
leek
two
hundred
pounds
remained
in
his
pockets
and
under
his
own
will
he
had
his
pound
a
week
of
which
he
never
spent
more
than
a
few
shillings
his
distractions
were
tobacco
which
cost
him
about
twopence
a
day
walking
about
and
enjoying
colour
effects
and
the
oddities
of
the
streets
which
cost
him
nearly
nought
and
reading
there
were
three
shops
of
putney
where
all
that
is
greatest
in
literature
could
be
bought
for
a
volume
do
what
he
could
he
could
not
read
away
more
than
ninepence
a
week
he
was
positively
accumulating
money
you
may
say
that
he
ought
to
have
compelled
alice
to
accept
money
the
idea
never
occurred
to
him
in
his
scheme
of
things
money
had
not
been
a
matter
of
sufficient
urgency
to
necessitate
an
argument
with
one
wife
she
was
always
welcome
to
all
that
he
had
and
now
suddenly
money
acquired
urgency
in
his
eyes
it
was
most
disturbing
he
was
not
frightened
he
was
merely
disturbed
if
he
had
ever
known
the
sensation
of
wanting
money
and
not
being
able
to
obtain
it
he
would
probably
have
been
frightened
but
this
sensation
was
unfamiliar
to
him
not
once
in
his
whole
career
had
he
hesitated
to
change
gold
from
fear
that
the
end
of
gold
was
at
hand
all
kinds
of
problems
crowded
round
him
he
went
out
for
a
stroll
to
escape
the
problems
but
they
accompanied
him
he
walked
through
exactly
the
same
streets
as
had
delighted
him
in
the
morning
and
they
had
ceased
to
delight
him
this
surely
could
not
be
ideal
putney
that
he
was
in
it
must
be
some
other
place
of
the
same
name
the
mismanagement
of
a
brewery
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
london
the
failure
of
the
british
to
drink
his
customary
pints
in
several
scattered
scores
of
had
most
unaccountably
knocked
the
bottom
out
of
the
putney
system
of
practical
philosophy
putney
posters
were
now
merely
disgusting
putney
trade
gross
and
futile
the
tobacconist
a
and
stupid
bourgeois
and
so
on
alice
and
he
met
on
their
doorstep
each
in
the
act
of
pulling
out
a
latchkey
oh
she
said
when
they
were
inside
it
done
for
there
no
mistake
it
done
for
we
sha
get
a
penny
this
year
not
one
penny
and
he
does
think
there
be
anything
next
year
either
and
the
shares
go
down
yet
he
says
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
all
my
life
did
you
he
admitted
sympathetically
that
he
had
not
after
she
had
been
upstairs
and
come
down
again
her
mood
suddenly
changed
well
she
smiled
whether
we
get
anything
or
not
so
we
have
tea
i
no
patience
with
worrying
i
said
i
should
make
pastry
after
tea
and
i
will
too
see
if
i
do
the
tea
was
perhaps
slightly
more
elaborate
than
usual
after
tea
he
heard
her
singing
in
the
kitchen
and
he
was
moved
to
go
and
look
at
her
there
she
was
with
her
sleeves
turned
back
and
a
large
pinafore
apron
over
her
rich
bosom
kneading
flour
he
would
have
liked
to
approach
her
and
kiss
her
but
he
never
could
accomplish
feats
of
that
kind
at
unusual
moments
oh
she
laughed
you
can
look
not
worrying
i
no
patience
with
worrying
later
in
the
afternoon
he
went
out
rather
like
a
person
who
has
reasons
for
leaving
inconspicuously
he
had
made
a
great
a
critical
resolve
he
passed
furtively
down
werter
road
into
the
high
street
and
then
stood
a
moment
outside
stawley
stationery
shop
which
is
also
a
library
an
emporium
of
and
an
he
entered
stawley
blushing
trembling
he
a
man
of
fifty
who
could
not
see
his
own
toes
and
asked
for
certain
tubes
of
colour
an
energetic
young
lady
who
seemed
to
know
all
about
the
graphic
arts
endeavoured
to
sell
to
him
a
magnificent
and
complicated
box
of
paints
which
opened
out
into
an
easel
and
a
stool
and
contained
a
palette
of
a
shape
preferred
by
the
late
edwin
long
a
selection
of
colours
which
had
been
approved
by
the
late
lord
leighton
and
a
patent
which
she
said
had
been
used
by
whistler
priam
farll
got
away
from
the
shop
without
this
apparatus
for
the
confection
of
masterpieces
but
he
did
not
get
away
without
a
which
he
had
had
no
intention
of
buying
the
young
lady
was
too
energetic
for
him
he
was
afraid
of
being
too
curt
with
her
lest
she
should
turn
on
him
and
tell
him
that
pretence
was
useless
she
knew
he
was
priam
farll
he
felt
guilty
and
he
felt
that
he
looked
guilty
as
he
hurried
along
the
high
street
towards
the
river
with
the
it
appeared
to
him
that
policemen
observed
him
inimically
and
cocked
their
helmets
at
him
as
who
should
say
see
here
this
wo
do
you
supposed
to
be
in
westminster
abbey
be
locked
up
if
you
too
brazen
the
tide
was
out
he
sneaked
down
to
the
gravelly
shore
a
little
above
the
steamer
pier
and
hid
himself
between
the
piles
glancing
around
him
in
a
scared
fashion
he
might
have
been
about
to
commit
a
crime
then
he
opened
the
and
oiled
the
palette
and
tried
the
elasticity
of
the
brushes
on
his
hand
and
he
made
a
sketch
of
the
scene
before
him
he
did
it
very
quickly
in
less
than
he
had
made
thousands
of
such
colour
in
his
life
and
he
would
never
part
with
any
of
them
he
had
always
hated
to
part
with
his
notes
doubtless
his
cousin
duncan
had
them
now
if
duncan
had
discovered
his
address
in
paris
as
duncan
probably
had
when
it
was
finished
he
inspected
the
sketch
half
shutting
his
eyes
and
holding
it
about
three
feet
off
it
was
good
except
for
a
few
pencil
scrawls
done
in
sheer
and
hastily
destroyed
this
was
the
first
sketch
he
had
made
since
the
death
of
henry
leek
but
it
was
very
good
no
mistake
who
done
that
he
murmured
and
added
that
the
devil
of
it
any
expert
would
twig
it
in
a
minute
only
one
man
that
could
have
done
it
i
shall
have
to
do
something
worse
than
that
he
shut
up
the
box
and
with
a
bang
as
an
amative
couple
came
into
sight
he
need
not
have
done
so
for
the
couple
vanished
instantly
in
deep
disgust
at
being
robbed
of
their
retreat
between
the
piles
alice
was
nearing
the
completion
of
pastry
when
he
returned
in
the
dusk
he
smelt
the
delicious
proof
creeping
quietly
upstairs
he
deposited
his
brushes
in
an
empty
attic
at
the
top
of
the
house
then
he
washed
his
hands
with
especial
care
to
remove
all
odour
of
paint
and
at
dinner
he
endeavoured
to
put
on
the
mien
of
innocence
she
was
cheerful
but
it
was
the
cheerfulness
of
determined
effort
they
naturally
talked
of
the
situation
it
appeared
that
she
had
a
reserve
of
money
in
the
bank
as
much
as
would
suffice
her
for
quite
six
months
he
told
her
with
false
buoyancy
that
there
need
never
be
the
slightest
difficulty
as
to
money
he
had
money
and
he
could
always
earn
more
if
you
think
i
going
to
let
you
go
into
another
situation
she
said
you
mistaken
that
all
and
her
lips
were
firm
this
staggered
him
he
never
could
remember
for
more
than
at
a
time
that
he
was
a
retired
valet
and
it
was
decidedly
not
her
practice
to
remind
him
of
the
fact
the
notion
of
himself
in
a
situation
as
valet
was
half
ridiculous
and
half
tragical
he
could
no
more
be
a
valet
than
he
could
be
a
stockbroker
or
a
i
was
thinking
of
that
he
stammered
then
what
were
you
thinking
of
she
asked
oh
i
do
know
he
said
vaguely
because
those
things
they
advertise
homework
envelope
addressing
or
selling
gramophones
on
commission
they
no
good
you
know
he
shuddered
the
next
morning
he
bought
a
x
canvas
and
more
brushes
and
tubes
and
surreptitiously
introduced
them
into
the
attic
happily
it
was
the
charwoman
day
and
alice
was
busy
enough
to
ignore
him
with
an
old
table
and
the
tray
out
of
a
he
arranged
a
substitute
for
an
easel
and
began
to
try
to
paint
a
bad
picture
from
his
sketch
but
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
discovered
that
he
was
exactly
as
fitted
to
paint
a
bad
picture
as
to
be
a
valet
he
could
not
sentimentalize
the
tones
nor
falsify
the
values
he
simply
could
not
the
attempt
to
do
so
annoyed
him
all
men
are
capable
of
stooping
beneath
their
highest
selves
and
in
several
directions
priam
farll
could
have
stooped
but
not
on
canvas
he
could
only
produce
his
best
he
could
only
render
nature
as
he
saw
nature
and
it
was
instinct
rather
than
conscience
that
prevented
him
from
stooping
in
three
days
during
which
he
kept
alice
out
of
the
attic
partly
by
lies
and
partly
by
locking
the
door
the
picture
was
finished
and
he
had
forgotten
all
about
everything
except
his
profession
he
had
become
a
different
man
a
very
excited
man
by
jove
he
exclaimed
surveying
the
picture
i
can
paint
artists
do
occasionally
soliloquize
in
this
way
the
picture
was
dazzling
what
atmosphere
what
poetry
and
what
profound
fidelity
to
nature
facts
it
was
precisely
such
a
picture
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
selling
for
or
a
before
his
burial
in
westminster
abbey
indeed
the
trouble
was
that
it
had
written
all
over
it
just
as
the
sketch
had
chapter
vii
that
evening
he
was
very
excited
and
he
seemed
to
take
no
thought
to
disguise
his
excitement
the
fact
was
he
could
not
have
disguised
it
even
if
he
had
tried
the
fever
of
artistic
creation
was
upon
him
all
the
old
desires
and
the
old
exhausting
joys
his
genius
had
been
lying
idle
like
a
lion
in
a
thicket
and
now
it
had
sprung
forth
ravening
for
months
he
had
not
handled
a
brush
for
months
his
mind
had
deliberately
avoided
the
question
of
painting
being
content
with
the
observation
only
of
beauty
a
week
ago
if
he
had
deliberately
asked
himself
whether
he
would
ever
paint
again
he
might
have
answered
perhaps
not
such
is
man
ignorance
of
his
own
nature
and
now
the
lion
of
his
genius
was
standing
over
him
its
paw
on
his
breast
and
making
a
great
noise
he
saw
that
the
last
few
months
had
been
merely
an
interlude
that
he
would
be
forced
to
paint
or
go
mad
and
that
nothing
else
mattered
he
saw
also
that
he
could
only
paint
in
one
way
priam
farll
way
if
it
was
discovered
that
priam
farll
was
not
buried
in
westminster
abbey
if
there
was
a
scandal
and
legal
unpleasantness
well
so
much
the
worse
but
he
must
paint
not
for
money
mind
you
incidentally
of
course
he
would
earn
money
but
he
had
already
quite
forgotten
that
life
has
its
financial
aspect
so
in
the
in
werter
road
he
walked
uneasily
to
and
fro
squeezing
between
the
table
and
the
sideboard
and
then
skirting
the
fireplace
where
alice
sat
with
a
darning
apparatus
upon
her
knees
and
her
spectacles
on
she
wore
spectacles
when
she
had
to
look
fixedly
at
very
dark
objects
the
room
was
ugly
in
a
pleasant
putneyish
way
with
a
couple
of
engravings
after
leader
a
too
realistic
hot
brown
furniture
with
ribbed
legs
a
carpet
with
the
characteristics
of
a
retired
governess
who
has
taken
to
drink
and
a
black
cloud
on
the
ceiling
over
the
incandescent
burners
happily
these
surroundings
did
not
annoy
him
they
did
not
annoy
him
because
he
never
saw
them
when
his
eyes
were
not
resting
on
beautiful
things
they
were
not
in
this
world
of
reality
at
all
his
sole
idea
about
was
an
harry
said
his
wife
do
you
think
you
better
sit
down
the
calm
voice
of
common
sense
stopped
him
in
his
circular
tour
he
glanced
at
alice
and
she
removing
her
spectacles
glanced
at
him
the
seal
on
his
dangled
free
he
had
to
talk
to
some
one
and
his
wife
was
there
not
only
the
most
convenient
but
the
most
proper
person
to
talk
to
a
tremendous
impulse
seized
him
to
tell
her
everything
she
would
understand
she
always
did
understand
and
she
never
allowed
herself
to
be
startled
the
most
singular
occurrences
immediately
they
touched
her
were
somehow
transformed
into
credible
daily
customary
events
thus
the
disaster
of
the
brewery
she
had
accepted
it
as
though
the
ruins
of
breweries
were
a
spectacle
to
be
witnessed
at
every
yes
he
should
tell
her
three
minutes
ago
he
had
no
intention
of
telling
her
or
any
one
anything
he
decided
in
an
instant
to
tell
her
his
secret
would
lead
up
naturally
to
the
picture
which
he
had
just
finished
i
say
alice
he
said
i
want
to
talk
to
you
well
she
said
i
wish
you
talk
to
me
sitting
down
i
do
know
what
come
over
you
this
last
day
or
two
he
sat
down
he
did
not
feel
really
intimate
with
her
at
that
moment
and
their
marriage
seemed
to
him
in
a
way
artificial
scarcely
a
fact
he
did
not
know
that
it
takes
years
to
accomplish
full
intimacy
between
husband
and
wife
you
know
he
said
henry
leek
is
my
real
name
oh
is
it
she
said
what
does
that
matter
she
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
to
hear
that
henry
leek
was
not
his
real
name
she
was
a
wise
woman
and
knew
the
strangeness
of
the
world
and
she
had
married
him
simply
because
he
was
himself
because
he
existed
in
a
particular
manner
whose
charm
for
her
she
could
not
have
described
from
hour
to
hour
so
long
as
you
have
committed
a
murder
or
anything
she
added
with
her
tranquil
smile
my
real
name
is
priam
farll
he
said
gruffly
the
gruffness
was
caused
by
timidity
i
thought
priam
farll
was
your
gentleman
name
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
said
nervously
there
was
a
mistake
that
photograph
that
was
sent
to
you
was
my
photograph
yes
she
said
i
know
it
was
and
what
of
it
i
mean
he
blundered
on
it
was
my
valet
that
died
not
me
you
see
the
doctor
when
he
came
thought
that
leek
was
me
and
i
did
tell
him
differently
because
i
was
afraid
of
all
the
bother
i
just
let
it
slide
and
there
were
other
reasons
you
know
how
i
am
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
she
said
ca
you
understand
it
simple
enough
i
priam
farll
and
i
had
a
valet
named
henry
leek
and
he
died
and
they
thought
it
was
me
only
it
was
he
saw
her
face
change
and
then
compose
itself
then
it
this
henry
leek
that
is
buried
in
westminster
abbey
instead
of
you
her
voice
was
very
soft
and
soothing
and
the
astonishing
woman
resumed
her
spectacles
and
her
long
needle
yes
of
course
here
he
burst
into
the
whole
story
into
the
middle
of
it
continuing
to
the
end
and
then
going
back
to
the
commencement
he
left
out
nothing
and
nobody
except
lady
sophia
entwistle
i
see
she
observed
and
you
never
said
a
word
not
a
word
if
i
were
you
i
should
still
keep
perfectly
silent
about
it
she
almost
whispered
persuasively
it
be
just
as
well
if
i
were
you
i
should
worry
myself
i
can
quite
understand
how
it
happened
and
glad
you
told
me
but
do
worry
you
been
exciting
yourself
these
last
two
or
three
days
i
thought
it
was
about
my
money
business
but
i
see
it
was
at
least
that
may
have
brought
it
on
like
now
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
forget
it
she
did
not
believe
him
she
simply
discredited
the
whole
story
and
told
in
werter
road
like
that
the
story
did
sound
fantastic
it
did
come
very
near
to
passing
belief
she
had
always
noticed
a
certain
queerness
in
her
husband
his
sudden
gaieties
about
a
tint
in
the
sky
or
the
gesture
of
a
horse
in
the
street
for
example
were
most
uncanny
and
he
had
peculiar
absences
of
mind
that
she
could
never
account
for
she
was
sure
that
he
must
have
been
a
very
bad
valet
however
she
did
not
marry
him
for
a
valet
but
for
a
husband
and
she
was
satisfied
with
her
bargain
what
if
he
did
suffer
under
a
delusion
the
exposure
of
that
delusion
merely
crystallized
into
a
definite
shape
her
vague
suspicions
concerning
his
mentality
besides
it
was
a
harmless
delusion
and
it
explained
things
it
explained
among
other
things
why
he
had
gone
to
stay
at
the
grand
babylon
hotel
that
must
have
been
the
inception
of
the
delusion
she
was
glad
to
know
the
worst
she
adored
him
more
than
ever
there
was
a
silence
no
she
repeated
in
the
most
tone
i
should
say
nothing
in
your
place
i
should
forget
it
you
would
he
drummed
on
the
table
i
should
and
whatever
you
do
do
worry
her
accents
were
the
coaxing
accents
of
a
nurse
with
a
child
or
with
a
lunatic
he
perceived
now
with
the
utmost
clearness
that
she
did
not
believe
a
word
of
what
he
had
said
and
that
in
her
magnificent
and
calm
sagacity
she
was
only
trying
to
humour
him
he
had
expected
to
disturb
her
soul
to
its
profoundest
depths
he
had
expected
that
they
would
sit
up
half
the
night
discussing
the
situation
and
lo
i
should
forget
it
indulgently
and
a
mild
continuance
of
darning
he
had
to
think
and
think
hard
henry
she
called
out
the
next
morning
as
he
disappeared
up
the
stairs
what
you
doing
up
there
she
had
behaved
exactly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
she
was
one
of
those
women
whose
prudent
policy
it
is
to
let
their
men
alone
even
to
the
furthest
limit
of
patience
but
she
had
nerves
too
and
they
were
being
affected
for
three
days
henry
had
really
been
too
mysterious
he
stopped
and
put
his
head
over
the
banisters
and
in
a
queer
moved
voice
answered
come
and
see
sooner
or
later
she
must
see
sooner
or
later
the
already
distended
situation
must
get
more
and
more
distended
until
it
burst
with
a
loud
report
let
the
moment
be
sooner
he
swiftly
decided
so
she
went
and
saw
up
the
attic
stairs
she
began
to
sniff
and
as
he
turned
the
knob
of
the
attic
door
for
her
she
said
what
a
smell
of
paint
i
fancied
yesterday
if
she
had
been
clever
enough
she
would
have
said
what
a
smell
of
masterpieces
but
her
cleverness
lay
in
other
fields
you
surely
have
been
aspinalling
that
chair
oh
this
loud
exclamation
escaped
from
her
as
she
entered
the
attic
and
saw
the
back
of
the
picture
which
priam
had
lodged
on
the
said
chair
filched
by
him
from
the
on
the
previous
day
she
stepped
to
the
vicinity
of
the
window
and
obtained
a
good
view
of
the
picture
it
was
brilliantly
shining
in
the
light
of
morn
it
looked
glorious
it
was
a
fit
companion
of
many
pictures
from
the
same
hand
distributed
among
european
galleries
it
had
that
priceless
quality
at
once
noble
and
radiant
which
distinguished
all
priam
work
it
transformed
the
attic
and
thousands
of
amateurs
and
students
from
petersburg
to
san
francisco
would
have
gone
into
that
attic
with
their
hats
off
and
a
thrill
in
the
spine
had
they
known
what
was
there
and
had
they
been
invited
to
enter
and
worship
priam
himself
was
pleased
he
was
delighted
he
was
enthusiastic
and
he
stood
near
the
picture
glancing
at
it
and
then
glancing
at
alice
nervously
like
a
mother
whose
has
come
to
look
at
the
baby
as
for
alice
she
said
nothing
she
had
first
of
all
to
take
in
the
fact
that
her
husband
had
been
ungenerous
enough
to
keep
her
quite
in
the
dark
as
to
the
nature
of
his
secret
activities
then
she
had
to
take
in
the
fact
of
the
picture
did
you
do
that
she
said
limply
yes
said
he
with
all
the
casualness
that
he
could
assume
how
does
it
strike
you
and
to
himself
this
make
her
see
i
not
a
mere
lunatic
this
give
her
a
shaking
up
i
sure
it
beautiful
she
said
kindly
but
without
the
slightest
conviction
what
is
it
is
that
putney
bridge
yes
he
said
i
thought
it
was
i
thought
it
must
be
well
i
never
knew
you
could
paint
it
beautiful
for
an
amateur
she
said
this
firmly
and
yet
endearingly
and
met
his
eyes
with
her
eyes
it
was
her
tactful
method
of
politely
causing
him
to
see
that
she
had
not
accepted
last
yarn
very
seriously
his
eyes
fell
not
hers
no
no
no
he
expostulated
with
quick
vivacity
as
she
stepped
towards
the
canvas
do
come
any
nearer
you
at
just
the
right
distance
oh
if
you
do
me
to
see
it
close
she
humoured
him
what
a
pity
you
have
put
an
omnibus
on
the
bridge
there
is
one
said
he
one
he
pointed
oh
yes
yes
i
see
but
you
know
i
think
it
looks
rather
more
like
a
carter
paterson
van
than
an
omnibus
if
you
could
paint
some
letters
on
it
jack
or
then
people
would
be
sure
but
beautiful
i
suppose
you
learnt
to
to
paint
from
your
she
checked
herself
what
that
red
streak
behind
that
the
railway
bridge
he
muttered
oh
of
course
it
is
how
silly
of
me
now
if
you
were
to
put
a
train
on
that
the
worst
of
trains
in
pictures
is
that
they
never
seem
to
be
going
along
i
noticed
that
on
the
sides
of
furniture
vans
you
but
if
you
put
a
signal
against
it
then
people
would
understand
that
the
train
had
stopped
i
not
sure
whether
there
a
signal
on
the
bridge
though
he
made
no
remark
and
i
see
that
the
elk
there
on
the
right
you
just
managed
to
get
it
in
i
can
recognize
that
quite
easily
any
one
would
he
still
made
no
remark
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
she
asked
gently
going
to
sell
it
my
dear
he
replied
grimly
it
may
surprise
you
to
know
that
that
canvas
is
worth
at
the
very
least
there
would
be
a
devil
of
a
row
and
rumpus
in
bond
street
and
elsewhere
if
they
knew
i
was
painting
here
instead
of
rotting
in
westminster
abbey
i
propose
to
sign
it
i
seldom
did
sign
my
pictures
and
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
i
got
fifteen
hundred
for
little
things
not
so
good
as
that
i
let
it
go
for
what
it
fetch
we
shall
soon
be
wanting
money
the
tears
rose
to
alice
eyes
she
saw
that
he
was
more
infinitely
more
mad
than
she
imagined
with
his
and
his
for
daubs
of
pictures
that
conveyed
no
meaning
whatever
to
the
eye
why
you
could
purchase
real
professional
pictures
of
lakes
and
mountains
exquisitely
finished
at
the
in
high
street
for
three
pounds
apiece
and
here
he
was
rambling
in
hundreds
and
thousands
she
saw
that
that
extraordinary
notion
about
being
able
to
paint
was
a
natural
consequence
of
the
pathetic
delusion
to
which
he
had
given
utterance
yesterday
and
she
wondered
what
would
follow
next
who
could
have
guessed
that
the
seeds
of
lunacy
were
in
such
a
man
yes
harmless
lunacy
but
lunacy
nevertheless
she
distinctly
remembered
the
little
shock
with
which
she
had
learned
that
he
was
staying
at
the
grand
babylon
on
his
own
account
as
a
wealthy
visitor
she
thought
it
bizarre
but
she
certainly
had
not
taken
it
for
a
sign
of
lunacy
and
yet
it
had
been
a
sign
of
madness
and
the
worst
of
harmless
lunacy
was
that
it
might
develop
at
any
moment
into
harmful
lunacy
there
was
one
thing
to
do
and
only
one
keep
him
quiet
shield
him
from
all
troubles
and
alarms
it
was
disturbance
of
spirit
which
induced
these
mental
derangements
his
master
death
had
upset
him
and
now
he
had
been
upset
by
her
disgraceful
brewery
company
she
made
a
step
towards
him
and
then
hesitated
she
had
to
form
a
plan
of
campaign
all
in
a
moment
she
had
to
keep
her
wits
and
to
use
them
how
could
she
give
him
confidence
about
his
absurd
picture
she
noticed
that
naïve
look
that
sometimes
came
into
his
eyes
a
boyish
expression
that
gave
the
he
to
his
greying
beard
and
his
generous
proportions
he
laughed
until
as
she
came
closer
he
saw
the
tears
on
her
eyelids
then
he
ceased
laughing
she
fingered
the
edge
of
his
coat
cajolingly
it
a
beautiful
picture
she
repeated
again
and
again
and
if
you
like
i
will
see
if
i
can
sell
it
for
you
but
henry
well
please
please
do
bother
about
money
we
shall
have
no
occasion
for
you
to
bother
and
i
wo
you
bothering
what
are
you
crying
for
he
asked
in
a
murmur
it
only
only
because
i
think
it
so
nice
of
you
trying
to
earn
money
like
that
she
lied
i
not
really
crying
and
she
ran
away
downstairs
really
crying
it
was
excessively
comic
but
he
had
better
not
follow
her
lest
he
might
cry
too
patron
of
the
a
lull
followed
this
crisis
in
the
affairs
of
no
werter
road
priam
went
on
painting
and
there
was
now
no
need
for
secrecy
about
it
but
his
painting
was
not
made
a
subject
of
conversation
both
of
them
hesitated
to
touch
it
she
from
tact
and
he
because
her
views
on
the
art
seemed
to
him
to
be
lacking
in
subtlety
in
every
marriage
there
is
a
topic
there
are
usually
several
which
the
husband
will
never
broach
to
the
wife
out
of
respect
for
his
respect
for
her
priam
scarcely
guessed
that
alice
imagined
him
to
be
on
the
way
to
lunacy
he
thought
she
merely
thought
him
queer
as
artists
queer
to
and
he
was
accustomed
to
that
henry
leek
had
always
thought
him
queer
as
for
alice
incredulous
attitude
towards
the
revelation
of
his
identity
he
did
not
mentally
accuse
her
of
treating
him
as
either
a
liar
or
a
madman
on
reflection
he
persuaded
himself
that
she
regarded
the
story
as
a
bad
joke
as
one
of
his
impulsive
capricious
essays
in
the
absurd
thus
the
march
of
evolution
was
apparently
arrested
in
werter
road
during
three
whole
days
and
then
a
singular
event
happened
and
progress
was
resumed
priam
had
been
out
since
early
morning
on
the
riverside
sketching
and
had
reached
barnes
from
which
town
he
returned
over
barnes
common
and
so
by
the
upper
richmond
road
to
high
street
he
was
on
the
south
side
of
upper
richmond
road
whereas
his
tobacconist
shop
was
on
the
north
side
near
the
corner
an
unfamiliar
peculiarity
of
the
shop
caused
him
to
cross
the
street
for
he
was
not
in
want
of
tobacco
it
was
the
look
of
the
window
that
drew
him
he
stopped
on
the
refuge
in
the
centre
of
the
street
there
was
no
necessity
to
go
further
his
picture
of
putney
bridge
was
in
the
middle
of
the
window
he
stared
at
it
fixedly
he
believed
his
eyes
for
his
eyes
were
the
finest
part
of
him
and
never
deceived
him
but
perhaps
if
he
had
been
a
person
with
ordinary
eyes
he
would
scarce
have
been
able
to
believe
them
the
canvas
was
indubitably
there
present
in
the
window
it
had
been
put
in
a
cheap
frame
such
as
is
used
for
chromographic
advertisements
of
ships
soups
and
tobacco
he
was
almost
sure
that
he
had
seen
that
same
frame
within
the
shop
round
a
pictorial
announcement
of
taddy
snuff
the
tobacconist
had
probably
removed
the
aristocrat
with
his
fingers
to
his
nose
from
the
frame
and
replaced
him
with
putney
bridge
in
any
event
the
frame
was
about
too
long
for
the
canvas
but
the
gap
was
scarcely
observable
on
the
frame
was
a
large
notice
sale
and
around
it
were
the
cigars
of
two
hemispheres
from
syak
whiffs
at
a
penny
each
to
precious
murias
and
cigarettes
of
every
allurement
and
the
multitudinous
fragments
of
all
advertised
tobaccos
and
meerschaums
and
briars
and
patent
pipes
and
diagrams
of
their
secret
machinery
and
laid
on
plush
and
pocket
receptacles
in
aluminium
and
other
precious
metals
shining
there
the
picture
had
a
most
incongruous
appearance
he
blushed
as
he
stood
on
the
refuge
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
mere
incongruity
of
the
spectacle
must
inevitably
attract
crowds
gradually
blocking
the
street
and
that
when
some
individual
not
absolutely
a
fool
in
art
had
perceived
the
quality
of
the
picture
well
then
the
trouble
of
public
curiosity
and
of
journalistic
inquisitiveness
would
begin
he
wondered
that
he
could
ever
have
dreamed
of
concealing
his
identity
on
a
canvas
the
thing
simply
shouted
farll
every
inch
of
it
in
any
exhibition
of
pictures
in
london
paris
rome
milan
munich
new
york
or
boston
it
would
have
been
the
cynosure
the
target
of
ecstatic
admirations
it
was
just
such
another
work
as
his
celebrated
which
hung
in
the
luxembourg
and
neither
a
frame
of
gold
nor
the
extremely
variegated
coloration
of
the
other
merchandise
on
sale
could
kill
it
however
there
were
no
signs
of
a
crowd
people
passed
to
and
fro
just
as
though
there
had
not
been
a
masterpiece
within
ten
thousand
miles
of
them
once
a
servant
girl
a
loaf
of
bread
in
her
red
arms
stopped
to
glance
at
the
window
but
in
an
instant
she
was
gone
running
priam
first
instinctive
movement
had
been
to
plunge
into
the
shop
and
demand
from
his
tobacconist
an
explanation
of
the
phenomenon
but
of
course
he
checked
himself
of
course
he
knew
that
the
presence
of
his
picture
in
the
window
could
only
be
due
to
the
enterprise
of
alice
he
went
slowly
home
the
sound
of
his
latchkey
in
the
keyhole
brought
her
into
the
hall
ere
he
had
opened
the
door
oh
henry
she
said
she
was
quite
excited
i
must
tell
you
i
was
passing
aylmer
this
morning
just
as
he
was
dressing
his
window
and
the
thought
struck
me
that
he
might
put
your
picture
in
so
i
ran
in
and
asked
him
he
said
he
would
if
he
could
have
it
at
once
so
i
came
and
got
it
he
found
a
frame
and
wrote
out
a
ticket
and
asked
after
you
no
one
could
have
been
kinder
you
must
go
and
have
a
look
at
it
i
should
be
at
all
surprised
if
it
gets
sold
like
that
priam
answered
nothing
for
a
moment
he
could
not
what
did
aylmer
say
about
it
he
asked
oh
said
his
wife
quickly
you
ca
expect
aylmer
to
understand
these
things
it
not
in
his
line
but
he
was
glad
to
oblige
us
i
saw
he
arranged
it
nicely
well
said
priam
discreetly
that
all
right
suppose
we
have
lunch
curious
her
relations
with
aylmer
it
was
she
who
had
recommended
him
to
go
to
aylmer
when
on
the
first
morning
of
his
residence
in
putney
he
had
demanded
any
decent
tobacconists
in
this
happy
region
he
suspected
that
had
it
not
been
for
aylmer
beridden
and
incurable
wife
alice
name
might
have
been
aylmer
he
suspected
aylmer
of
a
hopeless
passion
for
alice
he
was
glad
that
alice
had
not
been
thrown
away
on
aylmer
he
could
not
imagine
himself
now
without
alice
in
spite
of
her
ideas
on
the
graphic
arts
alice
was
his
air
his
atmosphere
his
oxygen
and
also
his
umbrella
to
shield
him
from
the
hail
of
untoward
circumstances
curious
the
process
of
love
it
was
the
power
of
love
that
had
put
that
picture
in
the
tobacconist
window
whatever
power
had
put
it
there
no
power
seemed
strong
enough
to
get
it
out
again
it
lay
exposed
in
the
window
for
weeks
and
never
drew
a
crowd
nor
caused
a
sensation
of
any
kind
not
a
word
in
the
newspapers
london
the
acknowledged
of
the
world
calmly
went
its
ways
the
sole
immediate
result
was
that
priam
changed
his
tobacconist
and
the
direction
of
his
promenades
at
last
another
singular
event
happened
alice
beamingly
put
five
sovereigns
into
priam
hand
one
evening
it
been
sold
for
five
guineas
she
said
joyous
aylmer
want
to
keep
anything
for
himself
but
i
insisted
on
his
having
the
odd
shillings
i
think
it
splendid
simply
splendid
of
course
i
always
think
it
was
a
beautiful
picture
she
added
the
fact
was
that
this
astounding
sale
for
so
large
a
sum
as
five
pounds
of
a
picture
done
in
the
attic
by
her
henry
had
enlarged
her
ideas
of
henry
skill
she
could
no
longer
regard
his
painting
as
the
caprice
of
a
gentle
lunatic
there
was
something
it
and
now
she
wanted
to
persuade
herself
that
she
had
known
from
the
first
there
was
something
in
it
the
picture
had
been
bought
by
the
eccentric
and
notorious
landlord
of
the
elk
hotel
down
by
the
river
on
a
sunday
afternoon
when
he
was
not
drunk
but
more
optimistic
than
the
state
of
english
society
warrants
he
liked
the
picture
because
his
was
so
unmistakably
plain
in
it
he
ordered
a
massive
gold
frame
for
it
and
hung
it
in
his
his
career
as
a
patron
of
the
arts
was
unfortunately
cut
short
by
an
order
signed
by
his
doctors
for
his
incarceration
in
a
lunatic
asylum
all
putney
had
been
saying
for
years
that
he
would
end
in
the
asylum
and
all
putney
was
right
chapter
viii
one
afternoon
in
december
priam
and
alice
were
in
the
together
and
alice
was
about
to
prepare
tea
the
cloth
was
laid
diagonally
on
the
table
because
alice
had
seen
cloths
so
laid
on
model
in
model
rooms
at
waring
the
strawberry
jam
occupied
the
northern
point
of
the
compass
and
the
marmalade
was
antarctic
while
brittle
cakes
and
spongy
cakes
represented
the
occident
and
the
orient
respectively
stood
rightly
for
the
centre
of
the
universe
silver
ornamented
the
spread
and
alice
two
for
she
would
never
allow
even
chinese
tea
to
remain
on
the
leaves
for
more
than
five
minutes
and
alice
with
the
patent
balanced
lid
occupied
a
tray
off
the
cloth
at
some
distance
but
still
on
the
table
a
kettle
moaned
over
a
alice
was
cutting
bread
for
toast
the
fire
was
of
the
right
redness
for
toast
and
a
lay
handy
as
winter
advanced
alice
teas
had
a
tendency
to
become
cosier
and
cosier
and
also
more
luxurious
more
of
a
ritualistic
ceremony
and
to
avoid
the
trouble
and
danger
of
going
through
a
cold
passage
to
the
kitchen
she
arranged
matters
so
that
the
entire
operation
could
be
performed
with
comfort
and
decency
in
the
itself
priam
was
rolling
cigarettes
many
of
them
and
placing
them
as
he
rolled
them
in
order
on
the
mantelpiece
a
happy
mild
couple
and
a
couple
one
would
judge
from
the
richness
of
the
tea
with
no
immediate
need
of
money
over
two
years
however
had
passed
since
the
catastrophe
to
cohoon
and
cohoon
had
in
no
way
recovered
therefrom
yet
money
had
been
regularly
found
for
the
household
the
manner
of
its
finding
was
soon
to
assume
importance
in
the
careers
of
priam
and
alice
but
ere
that
moment
an
astonishing
and
vivid
experience
happened
to
them
one
might
have
supposed
that
in
the
life
of
priam
farll
at
least
enough
of
the
astonishing
and
the
vivid
had
already
happened
nevertheless
what
had
already
happened
was
as
customary
and
unexciting
as
addressing
envelopes
compared
to
the
next
event
the
next
event
began
at
the
instant
when
alice
was
sticking
the
long
fork
into
a
round
of
bread
there
was
a
knock
at
the
front
door
a
knock
formidable
and
reverberating
the
knock
of
fate
perhaps
but
fate
disguised
as
a
coalheaver
alice
answered
it
she
always
answered
knocks
priam
never
she
shielded
him
from
every
rough
or
unexpected
contact
just
as
his
valet
used
to
do
the
gas
in
the
hall
was
not
lighted
and
so
she
stopped
to
light
it
darkness
having
fallen
then
she
opened
the
door
and
saw
in
the
gloom
a
short
thin
woman
standing
on
the
step
a
woman
of
advanced
dressed
with
a
kind
of
shabby
neatness
it
seemed
impossible
that
so
frail
and
unimportant
a
creature
could
have
made
such
a
noise
on
the
door
is
this
henry
leek
asked
the
visitor
in
a
dissatisfied
rather
weary
tone
yes
said
alice
which
was
not
quite
true
was
assuredly
hers
rather
than
her
husband
oh
said
the
woman
glancing
behind
her
and
entered
nervously
without
invitation
at
the
same
moment
three
male
figures
sprang
or
rushed
out
of
the
strip
of
front
garden
and
followed
the
woman
into
the
hall
lunging
up
against
alice
and
breathing
loudly
one
of
the
trio
was
a
strong
louring
man
of
some
thirty
years
it
seemed
probable
that
he
was
the
knocker
and
the
others
were
curates
with
the
proper
physical
attributes
of
curates
that
is
to
say
they
were
of
ascetic
habit
and
and
had
ingenuous
eyes
the
hall
now
appeared
like
the
antechamber
of
a
and
as
alice
had
never
seen
it
so
peopled
before
she
vented
a
natural
exclamation
of
surprise
yes
said
one
of
the
curates
fiercely
you
may
say
but
we
were
determined
to
get
in
and
in
we
have
got
john
shut
the
door
mother
do
put
yourself
about
john
being
the
and
man
shut
the
door
where
is
henry
leek
demanded
the
other
curate
now
priam
whose
curiosity
had
been
excusably
excited
by
the
unusual
sounds
in
the
hall
was
peeping
through
a
chink
of
the
door
and
the
elderly
woman
caught
the
glint
of
his
eyes
she
pushed
open
the
door
and
after
a
few
seconds
inspection
of
him
said
there
you
are
henry
after
thirty
years
to
think
of
it
priam
was
utterly
at
a
loss
i
his
wife
the
visitor
continued
sadly
to
alice
i
sorry
to
have
to
tell
you
i
his
wife
i
the
rightful
henry
leek
and
these
are
my
sons
come
with
me
to
see
that
i
get
justice
alice
recovered
very
quickly
from
the
shock
of
amazement
she
was
a
woman
not
easily
to
be
startled
by
the
vagaries
of
human
nature
she
had
often
heard
of
bigamy
and
that
her
husband
should
prove
to
be
a
bigamist
did
not
throw
her
into
a
swoon
she
at
once
in
her
own
mind
began
to
make
excuses
for
him
she
said
to
herself
as
she
inspected
the
real
henry
leek
that
the
real
henry
leek
had
certainly
the
temperament
which
manufactures
bigamists
she
understood
how
a
person
may
slide
into
bigamy
and
after
thirty
years
she
never
thought
of
bigamy
as
a
crime
nor
did
it
occur
to
her
to
run
out
and
drown
herself
for
shame
because
she
was
not
properly
married
to
priam
no
it
has
to
be
said
in
favour
of
alice
that
she
invariably
took
things
as
they
were
i
think
you
better
all
come
in
and
sit
down
quietly
she
said
eh
it
very
kind
of
you
said
the
mother
of
the
curates
limply
the
last
thing
that
the
curates
wanted
to
do
was
to
sit
down
quietly
but
they
had
to
sit
down
alice
made
them
sit
side
by
side
on
the
sofa
the
heavy
elder
brother
who
had
not
spoken
a
word
sat
on
a
chair
between
the
sideboard
and
the
door
their
mother
sat
on
a
chair
near
the
table
priam
fell
into
his
between
the
fireplace
and
the
sideboard
as
for
alice
she
remained
standing
she
showed
no
nervousness
except
in
her
handling
of
the
it
was
a
great
situation
but
unfortunately
ordinary
people
are
so
unaccustomed
to
the
great
situation
that
when
it
chances
to
come
they
feel
themselves
incapable
of
living
up
to
it
a
person
gazing
in
at
the
window
and
unacquainted
with
the
facts
might
have
guessed
that
the
affair
was
simply
a
tea
party
at
which
the
guests
had
arrived
a
little
too
soon
and
where
no
one
was
startlingly
proficient
in
the
art
of
still
the
curates
were
apparently
bent
on
doing
their
best
now
mother
one
of
them
urged
her
the
mother
as
if
a
spring
had
been
touched
in
her
began
he
married
me
just
thirty
years
ago
and
four
months
after
my
eldest
was
born
that
john
there
pointing
to
the
corner
near
the
door
he
just
walked
out
of
the
house
and
left
me
i
sorry
to
have
to
say
it
yes
sorry
i
am
but
there
it
is
and
never
a
word
had
i
ever
given
him
and
eight
months
after
that
my
twins
were
born
that
harry
and
matthew
pointing
to
the
sofa
harry
i
called
after
his
father
because
i
thought
he
was
like
him
and
just
to
show
i
bore
no
and
hoping
he
come
back
and
there
i
was
with
these
little
children
and
not
a
word
of
explanation
did
i
ever
have
i
heard
of
harry
five
years
later
when
johnnie
was
nearly
five
but
he
was
on
the
continent
and
i
could
go
traipsing
about
with
three
babies
besides
if
i
gone
sorry
i
am
to
say
it
but
many
the
time
he
beaten
me
yes
with
his
hands
and
his
fists
he
knocked
me
about
above
a
bit
and
i
never
gave
him
a
word
back
he
was
my
husband
for
better
for
worse
and
i
forgave
him
and
i
still
do
forgive
and
forget
that
what
i
say
we
only
heard
of
him
through
matthew
being
second
curate
at
paul
and
in
charge
of
the
mission
hall
it
was
your
milkman
that
happened
to
tell
matthew
that
he
had
a
customer
same
name
as
himself
and
you
know
how
one
thing
leads
to
another
so
here
i
never
saw
this
lady
in
my
life
said
priam
excitedly
and
absolutely
certain
i
never
married
her
i
never
married
any
one
except
of
course
you
alice
then
how
do
you
explain
this
sir
exclaimed
matthew
the
younger
twin
jumping
up
and
taking
a
blue
paper
from
his
pocket
be
so
good
as
to
pass
this
to
father
he
said
handing
the
paper
to
alice
alice
inspected
the
document
it
was
a
certificate
of
the
marriage
of
henry
leek
valet
and
sarah
featherstone
spinster
at
a
registry
office
in
paddington
priam
also
inspected
it
this
was
one
of
escapades
no
revelations
as
to
the
past
of
henry
leek
would
have
surprised
him
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
except
to
give
a
truthful
denial
of
identity
and
to
persist
in
that
denial
useless
to
say
soothingly
to
the
lady
visitor
that
she
was
the
widow
of
a
gentleman
who
had
been
laid
to
rest
in
westminster
abbey
i
know
nothing
about
it
said
priam
doggedly
i
suppose
you
not
deny
sir
that
your
name
is
henry
leek
said
henry
jumping
up
to
stand
by
matthew
i
deny
everything
said
priam
doggedly
how
could
he
explain
if
he
had
not
been
able
to
convince
alice
that
he
was
not
henry
leek
could
he
hope
to
convince
these
visitors
i
suppose
madam
henry
continued
addressing
alice
in
impressive
tones
as
if
she
were
a
crowded
congregation
that
at
any
rate
you
and
my
father
are
er
living
here
together
under
the
name
of
and
henry
leek
alice
merely
lifted
her
eyebrows
it
all
a
mistake
said
priam
impatiently
then
he
had
a
brilliant
inspiration
as
if
there
was
only
one
henry
leek
in
the
world
do
you
really
recognize
my
husband
alice
asked
your
husband
madam
matthew
protested
shocked
i
would
say
that
i
recognized
him
as
he
said
the
real
henry
leek
no
more
than
he
recognizes
me
after
thirty
years
time
i
saw
him
he
was
only
or
but
he
the
same
sort
of
man
and
he
has
the
same
eyes
and
look
at
henry
eyes
besides
i
heard
years
ago
that
he
gone
into
service
with
a
priam
farll
a
painter
or
something
him
that
was
buried
in
westminster
abbey
and
everybody
in
putney
knows
that
this
gentleman
gentleman
murmured
matthew
discontented
was
valet
to
priam
farll
we
heard
that
everywhere
i
suppose
you
not
deny
said
henry
the
younger
that
priam
farll
would
be
likely
to
have
valets
named
henry
leek
crushed
by
this
socratic
reasoning
priam
kept
silence
nursing
his
knees
and
staring
into
the
fire
alice
went
to
the
sideboard
where
she
kept
her
best
china
and
took
out
three
extra
cups
and
saucers
i
think
we
all
better
have
some
tea
she
said
tranquilly
and
then
she
got
the
and
put
seven
teaspoonfuls
of
tea
into
one
of
the
it
very
kind
of
you
i
sure
whimpered
the
authentic
henry
leek
now
mother
do
give
way
the
curates
admonished
her
do
you
remember
henry
she
went
on
whimpering
to
priam
how
you
said
you
would
be
married
in
a
church
not
for
anybody
and
how
i
gave
way
to
you
like
i
always
did
and
do
you
remember
how
you
would
let
poor
little
johnnie
be
baptized
well
i
do
hope
your
opinions
have
altered
eh
but
it
strange
it
strange
how
two
of
your
sons
and
just
them
two
that
you
never
set
eyes
on
until
this
day
should
have
made
up
their
minds
to
go
into
the
church
and
thanks
to
johnnie
there
they
been
able
to
if
i
was
to
tell
you
all
the
struggles
we
had
you
would
believe
me
they
were
clerks
and
they
might
have
been
clerks
to
this
day
if
it
had
been
for
johnnie
but
johnnie
could
always
earn
money
it
that
engineering
and
now
matthew
second
curate
at
paul
and
getting
fifty
pounds
a
year
and
henry
have
a
curacy
next
month
at
bermondsey
it
been
promised
and
all
thanks
to
johnnie
she
wept
johnnie
in
the
corner
who
had
so
far
done
nought
but
knock
at
the
door
maintained
stiffly
his
policy
of
priam
farll
angry
resentful
and
quite
untouched
by
the
recital
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
was
animated
by
the
sole
desire
to
fly
from
the
widow
and
progeny
of
his
late
valet
but
he
could
not
fly
the
herculean
john
was
too
close
to
the
door
so
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
second
time
yes
sir
said
matthew
you
may
shrug
your
shoulders
but
you
shrug
us
out
of
existence
here
we
are
and
you
ca
get
over
us
you
are
our
father
and
i
presume
that
a
kind
of
respect
is
due
to
you
yet
how
can
you
hope
for
our
respect
have
you
earned
it
did
you
earn
it
when
you
our
poor
mother
did
you
earn
it
when
you
left
her
with
the
most
inhuman
cruelty
to
fend
for
herself
in
the
world
did
you
earn
it
when
you
abandoned
your
children
born
and
unborn
you
are
a
bigamist
sir
a
deceiver
of
women
heaven
knows
would
you
mind
just
toasting
this
bread
alice
interrupted
his
impassioned
discourse
by
putting
the
loaded
into
his
hands
while
i
make
the
tea
it
was
a
novel
way
of
stopping
a
mustang
in
full
career
but
it
succeeded
while
somewhat
perfunctorily
holding
the
fork
to
the
fire
matthew
glared
about
him
to
signify
his
righteous
horror
and
other
sentiments
please
do
burn
it
said
alice
gently
suppose
you
were
to
sit
down
on
this
and
then
she
poured
boiling
water
on
the
tea
put
the
lid
on
the
pot
and
looked
at
the
clock
to
note
the
exact
second
at
which
the
process
of
infusion
had
begun
of
course
burst
out
henry
the
twin
of
matthew
i
need
not
say
madam
that
you
have
all
our
sympathies
you
are
in
a
do
you
mean
me
alice
asked
in
an
undertone
priam
could
be
heard
obstinately
repeating
never
set
eyes
upon
her
before
never
set
eyes
on
the
woman
before
i
do
madam
said
henry
not
to
be
cowed
nor
deflected
from
his
course
i
speak
for
all
of
us
you
have
our
sympathies
you
could
not
know
the
character
of
the
man
you
married
or
rather
with
whom
you
went
through
the
ceremony
of
marriage
however
we
have
heard
by
inquiry
that
you
made
his
acquaintance
through
the
medium
of
a
matrimonial
agency
and
indirectly
when
one
does
that
sort
of
thing
one
takes
one
chance
your
position
is
an
extremely
delicate
one
but
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
you
brought
it
on
yourself
in
my
work
i
have
encountered
many
sad
instances
of
the
result
of
lax
moral
principles
but
i
little
thought
to
encounter
the
saddest
of
all
in
my
own
family
the
discovery
is
just
as
great
a
blow
to
us
as
it
is
to
you
we
have
suffered
my
mother
has
suffered
and
now
i
fear
it
is
your
turn
to
suffer
you
are
not
this
man
wife
nothing
can
make
you
his
wife
you
are
living
in
the
same
house
with
him
under
circumstances
er
without
a
chaperon
i
hesitate
to
characterize
your
situation
in
plain
words
it
would
scarcely
become
me
or
mine
to
do
so
but
really
no
lady
could
possibly
find
herself
in
a
situation
more
false
than
i
am
afraid
there
is
only
one
word
open
immorality
and
er
to
put
yourself
right
with
society
there
is
one
thing
and
only
one
left
for
you
to
er
do
i
i
speak
for
the
family
and
i
sugar
alice
questioned
the
mother
of
curates
yes
please
one
lump
or
two
two
please
speaking
for
the
family
henry
resumed
will
you
kindly
pass
this
cup
to
your
mother
alice
suggested
henry
was
obliged
to
take
the
cup
excited
by
the
fever
of
eloquence
he
unfortunately
upset
it
before
it
had
reached
his
mother
hands
oh
henry
murmured
the
lady
mournfully
aghast
you
always
were
so
clumsy
and
a
clean
cloth
too
do
mention
it
please
said
alice
and
then
to
henry
my
dear
just
run
into
the
kitchen
and
bring
me
something
to
wipe
this
up
hanging
behind
the
door
you
see
priam
sprang
forward
with
astonishing
celerity
and
the
occasion
brooking
no
delay
the
guardian
of
the
portal
could
not
but
let
him
pass
in
another
moment
the
front
door
banged
priam
did
not
return
and
alice
staunched
the
flow
of
tea
with
a
clean
stiff
serviette
taken
from
the
sideboard
drawer
the
family
of
the
late
henry
leek
each
with
a
cup
in
hand
experienced
a
certain
difficulty
in
maintaining
the
interview
at
the
pitch
set
by
matthew
and
henry
leek
their
mother
frankly
gave
way
to
soft
tears
while
eating
jam
and
toast
john
took
everything
that
alice
offered
to
him
in
gloomy
and
awkward
silence
does
he
mean
to
come
back
matthew
demanded
at
length
he
had
risen
from
the
who
asked
alice
matthew
paused
and
then
said
savagely
and
deliberately
father
alice
smiled
i
afraid
not
i
afraid
he
gone
out
you
see
he
a
rather
peculiar
man
it
not
the
slightest
use
me
trying
to
drive
him
he
can
only
be
led
he
has
his
good
points
i
can
speak
candidly
as
he
is
here
and
i
he
has
his
good
points
when
leek
as
i
suppose
she
calls
herself
spoke
about
his
cruelty
to
her
well
i
understood
that
far
be
it
from
me
to
say
a
word
against
him
he
often
very
good
to
me
but
another
cup
mr
john
john
advanced
to
the
table
without
a
word
holding
his
cup
you
do
mean
to
say
said
leek
that
he
alice
nodded
grievously
leek
burst
into
tears
when
johnnie
was
barely
five
weeks
old
she
said
he
would
twist
my
arm
and
he
kept
me
without
money
and
once
he
locked
me
up
in
the
cellar
and
one
morning
when
i
was
ironing
he
snatched
the
hot
iron
out
of
my
hand
and
do
do
alice
soothed
her
i
know
i
know
all
you
can
tell
me
i
know
because
i
been
through
you
do
mean
to
say
he
threatened
with
the
if
threatening
was
only
all
said
alice
like
a
martyr
then
he
not
changed
in
all
these
years
wept
the
mother
of
curates
if
he
has
it
for
the
worse
said
alice
how
was
i
to
tell
she
faced
the
curates
how
could
i
know
and
yet
nobody
nobody
could
be
nicer
than
he
is
at
times
that
true
that
true
responded
the
authentic
henry
leek
he
was
always
so
changeable
so
queer
queer
alice
took
up
the
word
that
it
queer
i
do
think
right
in
his
head
not
quite
right
he
has
the
very
strangest
fancies
i
never
take
any
notice
of
them
but
they
there
i
seldom
get
up
in
the
morning
without
thinking
perhaps
he
have
to
be
taken
off
taken
off
yes
to
hanwell
or
wherever
it
is
and
you
must
remember
she
said
gazing
firmly
at
the
curates
you
got
his
blood
in
your
veins
forget
that
i
suppose
you
want
to
make
him
go
back
to
you
leek
as
he
certainly
ought
murmured
leek
feebly
well
if
you
can
persuade
him
to
go
said
alice
if
you
can
make
him
see
his
duty
you
welcome
but
i
sorry
for
you
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
this
is
my
house
and
my
furniture
he
got
nothing
at
all
i
expect
he
never
could
save
many
the
blow
he
laid
on
me
in
anger
but
all
the
same
i
pity
him
i
pity
him
and
i
would
like
to
leave
him
in
the
lurch
perhaps
these
three
strong
young
men
be
able
to
do
something
with
him
but
i
not
sure
he
very
strong
and
he
has
a
way
of
leaping
out
so
sudden
like
leek
shook
her
head
as
memories
of
the
past
rose
up
in
her
mind
the
fact
is
said
matthew
sternly
he
ought
to
be
prosecuted
for
bigamy
that
what
ought
to
be
done
most
decidedly
henry
concurred
you
quite
right
you
quite
right
said
alice
that
only
justice
of
course
he
deny
that
he
was
the
same
henry
leek
he
deny
it
like
anything
but
in
the
end
i
dare
say
you
be
able
to
prove
it
the
worst
of
these
law
cases
is
they
so
expensive
it
means
private
detectives
and
all
sorts
of
things
i
believe
of
course
there
be
the
scandal
but
do
mind
me
i
innocent
everybody
knows
me
in
putney
and
has
done
this
twenty
years
i
do
know
how
it
would
suit
you
henry
and
matthew
as
clergymen
to
have
your
own
father
in
prison
that
as
may
be
but
justice
is
justice
and
there
too
many
men
going
about
deceiving
simple
trusting
women
i
often
heard
such
tales
now
i
know
they
all
true
it
a
mercy
my
own
poor
mother
has
lived
to
see
where
i
am
as
for
my
father
old
as
he
was
if
he
been
alive
there
have
been
horsewhipping
that
i
do
know
after
some
rather
pointless
and
disjointed
remarks
from
the
curates
a
sound
came
from
the
corner
near
the
door
it
was
john
cough
better
clear
out
of
this
john
ejaculated
such
was
his
first
and
last
oral
contribution
to
the
scene
the
priam
farll
was
wandering
about
the
uncharted
groves
of
wimbledon
common
and
uttering
soliloquies
in
language
that
lacked
delicacy
he
had
rushed
forth
in
his
haste
without
an
overcoat
and
the
weather
was
blusterously
inclement
but
he
did
not
feel
the
cold
he
only
felt
the
keen
wind
of
circumstance
soon
after
the
purchase
of
his
picture
by
the
lunatic
landlord
of
a
fully
licensed
house
he
had
discovered
that
the
in
high
street
knew
a
man
who
would
not
be
indisposed
to
buy
such
pictures
as
he
could
paint
and
transactions
between
him
and
the
had
developed
into
a
regular
trade
the
usual
price
paid
for
canvases
was
ten
pounds
in
cash
by
this
means
he
had
earned
about
two
hundred
a
year
no
questions
were
put
on
either
side
the
paintings
were
delivered
at
intervals
and
the
money
received
and
priam
knew
no
more
for
many
weeks
he
had
lived
in
daily
expectation
of
an
uproar
a
scandal
in
the
visits
of
police
and
other
inconveniences
for
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
the
pictures
would
never
come
beneath
the
eye
of
a
expert
but
nothing
had
occurred
and
he
had
gradually
subsided
into
a
sense
of
security
he
was
happy
happy
in
the
untrammelled
exercise
of
his
gift
happy
in
having
all
the
money
that
his
needs
and
alice
demanded
happier
than
he
had
been
in
the
errant
days
of
his
glory
and
his
wealth
alice
had
been
amazed
at
his
power
of
earning
and
also
she
had
seemed
little
by
little
to
lose
her
suspicions
as
to
his
perfect
sanity
and
truthfulness
in
a
word
the
dog
of
fate
had
slept
and
he
had
taken
particular
care
to
let
it
lie
he
was
in
that
species
of
sheltered
groove
which
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
bliss
of
a
shy
and
nervous
artist
however
great
he
may
be
and
now
this
disastrous
irruption
this
resurrection
of
the
early
sins
of
the
real
leek
he
was
hurt
he
was
startled
he
was
furious
but
he
was
not
surprised
the
wonder
was
that
the
early
sins
of
henry
leek
had
not
troubled
him
long
ago
what
could
he
do
he
could
do
nothing
that
was
the
tragedy
he
could
do
nothing
he
could
but
rely
upon
alice
alice
was
amazing
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
masterly
her
handling
of
these
preposterous
curates
seemed
to
him
and
was
he
to
be
robbed
of
this
incomparable
woman
by
ridiculous
proceedings
connected
with
a
charge
of
bigamy
he
knew
that
bigamy
meant
prison
in
england
the
injustice
was
monstrous
he
saw
those
curates
and
their
mute
brother
and
the
aggrieved
mother
of
the
three
dogging
him
either
to
prison
or
to
his
deathbed
and
how
could
he
explain
to
alice
impossible
to
explain
to
alice
still
it
was
conceivable
that
alice
would
not
desire
explanation
alice
somehow
never
did
desire
an
explanation
she
always
said
i
can
quite
understand
and
set
about
preparing
a
meal
she
was
the
comfortablest
cushion
of
a
creature
that
the
evolution
of
the
universe
had
ever
produced
then
the
gusty
breeze
dropped
and
it
began
to
rain
he
ignored
the
rain
but
december
rain
has
a
strange
horrid
quality
of
chilly
persistence
it
is
capable
of
conquering
the
most
obstinate
and
serious
mental
preoccupation
and
it
conquered
priam
it
forced
him
to
admit
that
his
tortured
soul
had
a
fleshly
garment
and
that
the
fleshly
garment
was
soaked
to
the
marrow
and
his
soul
gradually
yielded
before
the
attack
of
the
rain
and
he
went
home
he
put
his
latchkey
into
the
door
with
minute
precautions
against
noise
and
crept
into
his
house
like
a
thief
and
very
gently
shut
the
door
then
in
the
hall
he
intently
listened
not
a
sound
that
is
to
say
not
a
sound
except
the
drippings
of
his
hat
on
the
linoleum
the
door
was
ajar
he
timidly
pushed
it
and
entered
alice
was
darning
stockings
henry
she
exclaimed
why
you
wet
through
she
rose
have
they
cleared
off
he
demanded
and
you
been
out
without
an
overcoat
henry
how
could
you
well
i
must
get
you
into
bed
at
once
instantly
or
i
shall
have
you
down
with
pneumonia
or
something
have
they
cleared
off
he
repeated
yes
of
course
she
said
when
are
they
coming
back
he
asked
i
do
think
they
come
back
she
replied
i
think
they
had
enough
i
think
i
made
them
see
that
it
best
to
leave
well
alone
did
you
ever
see
such
toast
as
that
curate
made
alice
i
assure
you
he
said
later
he
was
in
a
boiling
bath
i
assure
you
it
all
a
mistake
i
never
seen
the
woman
before
of
course
you
have
she
said
calmingly
of
course
you
have
besides
even
if
you
had
it
serves
her
right
every
one
could
see
a
nagging
woman
and
they
seemed
quite
prosperous
they
hysterical
that
what
the
matter
with
them
all
of
them
except
the
eldest
the
one
that
never
spoke
i
rather
liked
him
but
i
he
reiterated
splashing
his
positive
statement
into
the
water
my
dear
i
know
you
have
but
he
guessed
that
she
was
humouring
him
he
guessed
that
she
was
determined
to
keep
him
at
all
costs
and
he
had
a
disconcerting
glimpse
of
the
depths
of
utter
unscrupulousness
that
sometimes
disclose
themselves
in
the
mind
of
a
good
and
loving
woman
only
i
hope
there
wo
be
any
more
of
them
she
added
dryly
ah
that
was
the
point
he
conceived
the
possibility
of
the
rascal
leek
having
committed
scores
and
scores
of
sins
all
of
which
might
come
up
against
him
his
affrighted
vision
saw
whole
regions
populated
by
disconsolate
widows
of
henry
leek
and
their
offspring
ecclesiastical
and
otherwise
he
knew
what
leek
had
been
westminster
abbey
was
a
strange
goal
for
leek
to
have
achieved

glossy
the
machine
was
one
of
those
electric
contrivances
that
do
their
work
noiselessly
and
efficiently
like
a
garrotter
or
the
guillotine
no
odour
no
grind
of
no
trumpeting
with
that
machine
it
arrived
before
the
gate
with
such
absence
of
sound
that
alice
though
she
was
dusting
in
the
did
not
hear
it
she
heard
nothing
till
the
bell
discreetly
tinkled
justifiably
assuming
that
the
tinkler
was
the
butcher
boy
she
went
to
the
door
with
her
apron
on
and
even
with
the
duster
in
her
hand
a
handsome
smooth
man
stood
on
the
step
and
the
electric
carriage
made
a
background
for
him
he
was
a
dark
man
with
curly
black
hair
and
a
moustache
to
match
and
black
eyes
his
silk
hat
of
an
incredible
smooth
newness
glittered
over
his
glittering
hair
and
eyes
his
overcoat
was
lined
with
astrakan
and
this
important
fact
was
casually
betrayed
at
the
lapels
and
at
the
sleeves
he
wore
a
black
silk
necktie
with
a
small
pearl
pin
in
the
mathematical
centre
of
the
perfect
rhomboid
of
the
upper
part
of
a
sailor
knot
his
gloves
were
of
slate
colour
the
chief
characteristic
of
his
faintly
striped
trousers
was
the
crease
which
seemed
more
than
mortal
his
boots
were
of
kid
and
as
smooth
as
his
cheeks
the
cheeks
had
a
fresh
boyish
colour
and
between
them
over
admirable
snowy
teeth
projected
the
hooked
key
to
this
temperament
it
possible
that
alice
from
sheer
thoughtlessness
shared
the
vulgar
prejudice
against
jews
but
certainly
she
did
not
now
feel
it
the
man
personal
charm
his
exceeding
niceness
had
always
conquered
that
prejudice
whenever
encountered
moreover
he
was
only
about
in
years
and
no
such
costly
and
beautiful
male
had
ever
yet
stood
on
doorstep
she
at
once
in
her
mind
contrasted
him
with
the
curates
of
the
previous
week
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
established
church
she
did
not
know
that
this
man
was
more
dangerous
than
a
thousand
curates
is
this
mr
leek
he
inquired
smilingly
and
raised
his
hat
yes
said
alice
with
a
responsive
smile
is
he
in
well
said
alice
he
busy
at
his
work
you
see
in
this
weather
he
ca
go
out
much
not
to
work
and
so
he
could
i
see
him
in
his
studio
asked
the
glossy
man
with
the
air
of
saying
can
you
grant
me
this
supreme
favour
it
was
the
first
time
that
alice
had
heard
the
attic
called
a
studio
she
paused
it
about
pictures
explained
the
visitor
oh
said
alice
will
you
come
in
i
run
down
specially
to
see
leek
said
the
visitor
with
emphasis
alice
opinion
as
to
the
seriousness
of
her
husband
gift
for
painting
had
of
course
changed
in
two
years
a
man
who
can
make
two
or
three
hundred
a
year
by
sticking
colours
anyhow
at
any
hazard
on
canvases
by
producing
alleged
pictures
that
in
alice
secret
view
bore
only
a
comic
resemblance
to
anything
at
all
that
man
had
to
be
taken
seriously
in
his
attic
as
an
artisan
it
is
true
that
alice
thought
the
payment
he
received
miraculously
high
for
the
quality
of
work
done
but
with
this
agreeable
jew
in
the
hall
and
the
at
the
kerb
she
suddenly
perceived
the
probability
of
even
greater
miracles
in
the
matter
of
price
she
saw
the
average
price
of
ten
pounds
rising
to
fifteen
or
even
twenty
pounds
provided
her
husband
was
given
no
opportunity
to
ruin
the
affair
by
his
absurd
retiring
shyness
will
you
come
this
way
she
suggested
briskly
and
all
that
elegance
followed
her
up
to
the
attic
door
which
door
she
threw
open
remarking
simply
henry
here
is
a
gentleman
come
to
see
you
about
pictures
priam
recovered
more
quickly
than
might
have
been
expected
his
first
thought
was
naturally
that
women
are
uncalculated
if
not
incalculable
creatures
and
that
the
best
of
them
will
do
impossible
things
things
inconceivable
till
actually
done
fancy
her
introducing
a
stranger
without
a
word
of
warning
direct
into
his
attic
however
when
he
rose
he
saw
the
visitor
nose
whose
nostrils
were
delicately
expanding
and
contracting
in
the
fumes
of
the
and
he
was
at
once
reassured
he
knew
that
he
would
have
to
face
neither
rudeness
nor
bluntness
nor
lack
of
imagination
nor
lack
of
quick
sympathy
besides
the
visitor
with
practical
assurance
set
the
tone
of
the
interview
instantly
he
began
right
off
i
must
apologize
for
breaking
in
upon
you
but
i
come
to
see
if
you
have
any
work
to
sell
my
name
is
oxford
and
i
acting
for
a
collector
he
said
this
with
a
very
agreeable
mingling
of
sincerity
deference
and
mercantile
directness
also
with
a
bright
admiring
smile
he
showed
no
astonishment
at
the
interior
of
the
attic
well
of
course
it
would
be
idle
to
pretend
that
the
greatest
artists
do
not
enjoy
being
addressed
as
is
the
same
word
but
entirely
different
it
was
a
long
time
since
priam
farll
had
been
called
indeed
owing
to
his
retiring
habits
he
had
very
seldom
been
called
at
all
a
picture
stood
on
an
easel
near
the
window
it
represented
one
of
the
most
wonderful
scenes
in
london
putney
high
street
at
night
two
omnibus
horses
stepped
strongly
and
willingly
out
of
a
dark
side
street
and
under
the
cold
glare
of
the
main
road
they
somehow
took
on
the
quality
of
equestrian
sculpture
the
altercation
of
lights
was
in
the
highest
degree
complex
priam
understood
immediately
from
the
man
calm
glance
at
the
picture
and
the
position
which
he
instinctively
took
up
to
see
it
that
he
was
accustomed
to
looking
at
pictures
the
visitor
did
not
start
back
nor
rush
forward
nor
dissolve
into
hysterics
nor
behave
as
though
confronted
by
the
ghost
of
a
murdered
victim
he
just
gazed
at
the
picture
keeping
his
nerve
and
holding
his
tongue
and
yet
it
was
not
an
easy
picture
to
look
at
it
was
a
picture
of
an
advanced
experimentalism
and
would
have
appealed
to
nothing
but
the
sense
of
humour
in
a
person
not
a
connoisseur
sell
exclaimed
priam
like
all
shy
men
he
could
hide
his
shyness
in
an
exaggerated
familiarity
what
price
this
and
he
pointed
to
the
picture
there
were
no
other
preliminaries
it
is
excessively
distinguished
murmured
oxford
in
the
accents
of
expert
appreciation
excessively
distinguished
may
i
ask
how
much
that
what
i
asking
you
said
priam
fiddling
with
a
paint
rag
hum
observed
oxford
and
gazed
in
silence
then
two
hundred
and
fifty
priam
had
virtually
promised
to
deliver
that
picture
to
the
on
the
next
day
and
he
had
not
expected
to
receive
a
penny
more
than
twelve
pounds
for
it
but
artists
are
strange
organisms
he
shook
his
head
although
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
was
as
much
as
he
had
earned
in
the
previous
twelve
months
he
shook
his
grey
head
no
said
oxford
kindly
and
respectfully
putting
his
hands
behind
his
back
by
the
way
he
turned
with
eagerness
to
priam
i
presume
you
have
seen
the
portrait
of
ariosto
by
titian
that
they
bought
for
the
national
gallery
what
is
your
opinion
of
it
he
stood
expectant
glowing
with
interest
except
that
it
is
ariosto
and
it
certainly
is
by
titian
it
a
pretty
sort
of
thing
said
priam
oxford
smiled
with
appreciative
content
nodding
his
head
i
hoped
you
would
say
so
he
remarked
and
swiftly
he
passed
on
to
segantini
then
to
morrice
and
then
to
bonnard
demanding
the
views
in
a
few
moments
they
were
really
discussing
pictures
and
it
was
years
since
priam
had
listened
to
the
voice
of
informed
common
sense
on
the
subject
of
painting
it
was
years
since
he
had
heard
anything
but
exceeding
puerility
concerning
pictures
he
had
in
fact
accustomed
himself
not
to
listen
he
had
excavated
a
passage
direct
from
one
ear
to
the
other
for
such
remarks
and
now
he
drank
up
the
conversation
of
oxford
and
perceived
that
he
had
long
been
thirsty
and
he
spoke
his
mind
he
grew
warmer
more
enthusiastic
more
impassioned
and
oxford
listened
with
ecstasy
oxford
had
apparently
a
natural
discretion
he
simply
accepted
priam
as
he
stood
for
a
great
painter
no
reference
to
the
enigma
why
a
great
painter
should
be
painting
in
an
attic
in
werter
road
putney
no
inconvenient
queries
about
the
great
painter
previous
history
and
productions
just
the
frank
full
acceptance
of
his
genius
it
was
odd
but
it
was
comfortable
so
you
wo
take
two
hundred
and
fifty
asked
oxford
hopping
back
to
business
no
said
priam
sturdily
the
truth
is
he
added
i
should
rather
like
to
keep
that
picture
for
myself
will
you
take
five
hundred
yes
i
suppose
i
will
and
priam
sighed
a
genuine
sigh
for
he
would
really
have
liked
to
keep
the
picture
he
knew
he
had
never
painted
a
better
and
may
i
carry
it
away
with
me
asked
oxford
i
expect
so
said
priam
i
wonder
if
i
might
venture
to
ask
you
to
come
back
to
town
with
me
oxford
went
on
in
gentle
deference
i
have
one
or
two
pictures
i
should
very
much
like
you
to
see
and
i
fancy
they
might
give
you
pleasure
and
we
could
talk
over
future
business
if
possibly
you
could
spare
an
hour
or
so
if
i
might
request
a
desire
rose
in
priam
breast
and
fought
against
his
timidity
the
tone
in
which
oxford
had
said
i
fancy
they
might
give
you
pleasure
appeared
to
indicate
something
very
much
out
of
the
common
and
priam
could
scarcely
recollect
when
last
his
eyes
had
rested
on
a
picture
that
was
at
once
unfamiliar
and
great
i
have
already
indicated
that
the
machine
was
somewhat
out
of
the
ordinary
it
was
as
a
fact
exceedingly
out
of
the
ordinary
it
was
much
larger
than
electric
carriages
usually
are
it
had
what
the
writers
of
notes
in
papers
written
by
the
wealthy
for
the
wealthy
love
to
call
a
body
and
outside
and
in
it
was
miraculously
new
and
spotless
on
the
ivory
handles
of
its
doors
on
its
soft
yellow
leather
upholstery
on
its
cedar
woodwork
on
its
patent
blind
apparatus
on
its
silver
fittings
on
its
lamps
on
its
footstools
on
its
silken
not
the
minutest
trace
of
usage
oxford
car
seemed
to
show
that
oxford
never
used
a
car
twice
purchasing
a
new
car
every
morning
like
stockbrokers
their
silk
hats
or
the
duke
of
selsea
his
trousers
there
was
a
table
in
the
for
writing
and
pockets
up
and
down
devised
to
hold
documents
also
two
and
a
suspended
contrivance
which
showed
the
hour
the
temperature
and
the
fluctuations
of
the
barometer
there
was
also
a
one
felt
that
if
the
machine
had
been
connected
by
wireless
telegraphy
with
the
stock
exchange
the
leading
studios
and
the
houses
of
parliament
and
if
a
little
restaurant
had
been
constructed
in
the
rear
oxford
might
never
have
been
under
the
necessity
of
leaving
the
car
that
he
might
have
passed
all
his
days
in
it
from
morn
to
latest
eve
the
perfection
of
the
machine
and
of
oxford
attire
and
complexion
caused
priam
to
look
rather
shabby
indeed
he
was
rather
shabby
shabbiness
had
slightly
overtaken
him
in
putney
once
he
had
been
a
dandy
but
that
was
in
the
lamented
leek
time
and
as
the
car
glided
without
smell
and
without
noise
through
the
encumbered
avenues
of
london
towards
the
centre
now
shooting
forward
like
a
star
now
stopping
with
gentle
suddenness
now
swerving
in
a
swift
curve
round
a
vehicle
earthy
and
priam
grew
more
and
more
uncomfortable
he
had
sunk
into
a
groove
at
putney
he
never
left
putney
save
occasionally
to
refresh
himself
at
the
national
gallery
and
thither
he
invariably
went
by
train
and
tube
because
the
tube
always
filled
him
with
wonder
and
romance
and
always
threw
him
up
out
of
the
earth
at
the
corner
of
trafalgar
square
with
such
a
strange
exhilaration
in
his
soul
so
that
he
had
not
seen
the
main
avenues
of
london
for
a
long
time
he
had
been
forgetting
riches
and
luxury
and
the
oriental
whose
proprietors
names
end
in
and
the
haughtiness
of
the
ruling
classes
and
the
still
sterner
haughtiness
of
their
footmen
he
had
now
abandoned
alice
in
putney
and
a
mysterious
demon
seized
him
and
gripped
him
and
sought
to
pull
him
back
in
the
direction
of
the
simplicity
of
putney
and
struggled
with
him
fiercely
and
made
him
writhe
and
shrink
before
the
brilliant
phenomena
of
london
centre
and
indeed
almost
pitched
him
out
of
the
car
and
set
him
running
as
hard
as
legs
would
carry
to
putney
it
was
the
demon
which
we
call
habit
he
would
have
given
a
picture
to
be
in
putney
instead
of
swimming
past
hyde
park
corner
to
the
accompaniment
of
oxford
amiable
and
deferential
and
tactful
conversation
however
his
other
demon
shyness
kept
him
from
imperiously
stopping
the
car
the
car
stopped
itself
in
bond
street
in
front
of
a
building
with
a
wide
archway
and
the
symbol
of
empire
floating
largely
over
its
roof
placards
said
that
admission
through
the
archway
was
a
shilling
but
oxford
bearing
priam
latest
picture
as
though
it
had
cost
fifty
thousand
instead
of
five
hundred
pounds
went
straight
into
the
place
without
paying
and
priam
accepted
his
impressive
invitation
to
follow
aged
military
veterans
whose
breasts
carried
a
row
of
medals
saluted
oxford
as
he
entered
and
within
the
penetralia
beings
in
silk
hats
as
faultless
as
oxford
raised
those
hats
to
oxford
who
did
not
raise
his
in
reply
merely
nodded
napoleonically
his
demeanour
had
greatly
changed
you
saw
here
the
man
of
unbending
will
accustomed
to
use
men
as
pawns
in
the
chess
of
a
complicated
career
presently
they
reached
a
private
office
where
oxford
with
the
assistance
of
a
page
removed
his
gloves
furs
and
hat
and
sent
sharply
for
a
man
who
at
once
brought
a
frame
which
fitted
priam
picture
do
have
a
cigar
oxford
urged
priam
with
a
quick
return
to
his
earlier
manner
offering
a
box
in
which
each
cigar
was
separately
encased
in
the
cigar
was
such
as
costs
a
crown
in
a
restaurant
in
a
shop
and
twopence
in
amsterdam
it
was
a
princely
cigar
with
the
odour
of
paradise
and
an
ash
as
white
as
snow
but
priam
could
not
appreciate
it
no
he
had
seen
on
a
beaten
copper
plate
under
the
archway
these
words
galleries
he
was
in
the
celebrated
galleries
of
his
former
dealers
whom
by
the
way
he
had
never
seen
and
he
was
afraid
he
was
mortally
apprehensive
and
had
a
sickly
sensation
in
the
stomach
after
they
had
scrupulously
inspected
the
picture
through
the
clouds
of
incense
oxford
wrote
out
a
cheque
for
five
hundred
pounds
and
cigar
in
mouth
handed
it
to
priam
who
tried
to
take
it
with
a
casual
air
and
did
not
succeed
it
was
signed
i
dare
say
you
have
heard
that
i
now
the
sole
proprietor
of
this
place
said
oxford
through
his
cigar
really
said
priam
feeling
just
as
nervous
as
an
inexperienced
youth
then
oxford
led
priam
over
thick
carpets
to
a
saloon
where
electric
light
was
thrown
by
means
of
reflectors
on
to
a
small
but
incomparable
band
of
pictures
oxford
had
not
exaggerated
they
did
give
pleasure
to
priam
they
were
not
the
pictures
one
sees
every
day
nor
once
a
year
there
was
the
finest
delacroix
of
its
size
that
priam
had
ever
met
with
also
a
vermeer
that
made
it
unnecessary
to
visit
the
ryks
museum
and
on
the
more
distant
wall
to
which
oxford
came
last
in
a
place
of
marked
honour
was
an
evening
landscape
of
volterra
a
in
italy
the
bolts
of
priam
very
soul
started
when
he
caught
sight
of
that
picture
on
the
lower
edge
of
the
rich
frame
were
two
words
in
black
lettering
farll
how
well
he
remembered
painting
it
and
how
masterfully
beautiful
it
was
now
that
said
oxford
is
in
my
humble
opinion
one
of
the
finest
farlls
in
existence
what
do
you
think
mr
leek
priam
paused
i
agree
with
you
said
he
farll
said
oxford
is
about
the
only
modern
painter
that
can
stand
the
company
that
that
picture
has
in
this
room
eh
priam
blushed
yes
he
said
there
is
a
considerable
difference
in
various
matters
between
putney
and
volterra
but
the
picture
of
volterra
and
the
picture
of
putney
high
street
were
obviously
strikingly
incontestably
by
the
same
hand
one
could
not
but
perceive
the
same
the
same
masses
the
same
manner
of
seeing
and
of
grasping
in
a
word
the
same
dazzling
and
austere
translation
of
nature
the
resemblance
jumped
at
one
and
shook
one
by
the
shoulders
it
could
not
have
escaped
even
an
auctioneer
yet
oxford
did
not
refer
to
it
he
seemed
quite
blind
to
it
all
he
said
was
as
they
left
the
room
and
priam
finished
his
rather
monosyllabic
praise
yes
that
the
little
collection
i
just
got
together
and
i
am
very
proud
to
have
shown
it
to
you
now
i
want
you
to
come
and
lunch
with
me
at
my
club
please
do
i
should
be
desolated
if
you
refused
priam
did
not
care
a
halfpenny
about
the
desolation
of
oxford
and
he
most
sincerely
objected
to
lunch
at
oxford
club
but
he
said
yes
because
it
was
the
easiest
thing
for
his
shyness
to
do
oxford
being
a
determined
man
priam
was
afraid
to
go
he
was
disturbed
alarmed
affrighted
by
the
mystery
of
oxford
silence
they
arrived
at
the
club
in
the
car
priam
had
never
been
in
a
club
before
the
statement
may
astonish
may
even
meet
with
incredulity
but
it
is
true
he
had
left
the
land
of
clubs
early
in
life
as
for
the
english
clubs
in
european
towns
he
was
familiar
with
their
exteriors
and
with
the
amiable
babble
of
their
supporters
at
and
his
desire
for
further
knowledge
had
not
been
so
hot
as
to
inconvenience
him
hence
he
knew
nothing
of
clubs
oxford
club
alarmed
and
intimidated
him
it
was
so
big
and
so
black
externally
it
resembled
a
of
some
great
industrial
town
as
you
stood
on
the
pavement
at
the
bottom
of
the
flight
of
giant
steps
that
led
to
the
first
pair
of
swinging
doors
your
head
was
certainly
lower
than
the
feet
of
a
being
who
examined
you
sternly
from
the
other
side
of
the
glass
your
head
was
also
far
below
the
sills
of
the
mighty
windows
of
the
there
were
two
storeys
above
the
and
above
them
a
projecting
eave
of
carven
stone
that
threatened
the
uplifted
eye
like
a
menace
the
tenth
part
of
a
slate
the
merest
chip
of
a
corner
falling
from
the
lofty
summit
of
that
pile
would
have
slain
elephants
and
all
the
façade
was
black
black
with
ages
of
carbonic
deposit
the
notion
that
the
building
was
a
that
had
got
itself
misplaced
and
perverted
gradually
left
you
as
you
gazed
you
perceived
its
falseness
you
perceived
that
oxford
club
was
a
monument
a
relic
of
the
days
when
there
were
giants
on
earth
that
it
had
come
down
unimpaired
to
a
race
of
pigmies
who
were
making
the
best
of
it
the
sole
descendant
of
the
giants
was
the
scout
behind
the
door
as
oxford
and
priam
climbed
towards
it
this
unique
giant
with
a
giant
force
pulled
open
the
gigantic
door
and
oxford
and
priam
walked
imperceptibly
in
and
the
door
swung
to
with
a
large
displacement
of
air
priam
found
himself
in
an
immense
interior
under
a
distant
carved
ceiling
far
far
upwards
like
heaven
he
watched
oxford
write
his
name
in
a
gigantic
folio
under
a
gigantic
clock
this
accomplished
oxford
led
him
past
enormous
vistas
to
right
and
left
into
a
very
long
chamber
both
of
whose
long
walls
were
studded
with
thousands
upon
thousands
of
massive
hooks
and
here
and
there
upon
a
hook
a
silk
hat
or
an
overcoat
oxford
chose
a
couple
of
hooks
in
the
expanse
and
when
they
had
divested
themselves
sufficiently
he
led
priam
forwards
into
another
great
chamber
evidently
meant
to
recall
the
baths
of
carcalla
in
gigantic
basins
chiselled
out
of
solid
granite
priam
scrubbed
his
with
a
larger
than
he
had
previously
encountered
even
in
nightmares
and
an
attendant
brushed
his
coat
with
a
utensil
that
resembled
a
weapon
of
offence
lately
the
property
of
anak
shall
we
go
straight
to
the
now
asked
oxford
or
will
you
have
a
gin
and
angostura
first
priam
declined
the
gin
and
angostura
and
they
went
up
an
overwhelming
staircase
of
sombre
marble
and
through
other
apartments
to
the
which
would
have
made
an
excellent
here
one
had
six
of
the
gigantic
windows
in
a
row
each
with
curtains
that
fell
in
huge
folds
from
the
unseen
into
the
seen
the
ceiling
probably
existed
on
every
wall
were
gigantic
paintings
in
thick
ornate
frames
and
between
the
windows
stood
heroic
busts
of
marble
set
upon
columns
of
basalt
the
chairs
would
have
been
immovable
had
they
not
run
on
castors
of
rock
yet
against
the
tables
they
had
the
air
of
negligible
toys
at
one
end
of
the
room
was
a
sideboard
that
would
not
have
groaned
under
an
ox
whole
and
at
the
other
a
fire
over
which
an
ox
might
have
been
roasted
in
its
entirety
leaped
under
a
mantelpiece
upon
which
goliath
could
not
have
put
his
elbows
all
was
silent
and
grave
the
floors
were
everywhere
covered
with
heavy
carpets
which
hushed
all
echoes
there
was
not
the
faintest
sound
sound
indeed
seemed
to
be
deprecated
priam
had
already
passed
the
wide
entrance
to
one
illimitable
room
whose
walls
were
clothed
with
warnings
in
gigantic
letters
and
he
had
noticed
that
all
chairs
and
couches
were
thickly
padded
and
upholstered
in
soft
leather
and
that
it
was
impossible
to
produce
in
them
the
slightest
creak
at
a
casual
glance
the
place
seemed
unoccupied
but
on
more
careful
inspection
you
saw
midgets
creeping
about
or
seated
in
that
had
obviously
been
made
to
hold
two
of
them
these
midgets
were
the
members
of
the
club
dwarfed
into
dolls
by
its
tremendous
dimensions
a
strange
and
sinister
race
they
looked
as
though
in
the
final
stages
of
decay
and
wherever
their
heads
might
rest
was
stretched
a
white
cloth
so
that
their
heads
might
not
touch
the
spots
sanctified
by
the
heads
of
the
mighty
departed
they
rarely
spoke
to
one
another
but
exchanged
regards
of
mutual
distrust
and
scorn
and
if
by
chance
they
did
converse
it
was
in
tones
of
weary
brusque
disillusion
they
could
at
best
descry
each
other
but
indistinctly
in
the
universal
pervading
gloom
a
gloom
upon
which
electric
lamps
shining
dimly
yellow
in
their
vast
lustres
produced
almost
no
impression
the
whole
establishment
was
buried
in
the
past
dreaming
of
its
titantic
yore
when
there
were
doubtless
giants
who
could
fill
those
fauteuils
and
stick
their
feet
on
those
mantelpieces
it
was
in
such
an
environment
that
oxford
gave
priam
to
eat
and
to
drink
off
little
ordinary
plates
and
out
of
tiny
tumblers
no
hint
of
the
club
immemorial
history
in
that
excessively
modern
and
excellent
repast
save
in
the
stilton
cheese
which
seemed
to
have
descended
from
the
fine
fruity
days
of
some
homeric
age
a
cheese
that
ulysses
might
have
inaugurated
i
need
hardly
say
that
the
total
effect
on
temperament
was
disastrous
yet
how
could
the
diplomatic
oxford
have
guessed
that
priam
had
never
been
in
a
club
before
it
induced
in
him
a
speechless
anguish
and
he
would
have
paid
a
sum
as
gigantic
as
the
club
he
would
have
paid
the
very
cheque
in
his
pocket
never
to
have
met
oxford
he
was
a
far
too
sensitive
man
for
a
club
and
his
moods
were
incalculable
assuredly
oxford
had
miscalculated
the
result
of
his
club
on
priam
humour
he
soon
saw
his
error
suppose
we
take
coffee
in
the
he
said
the
populous
was
the
one
part
of
the
club
where
talking
with
a
natural
loudness
was
not
a
crime
oxford
found
a
corner
fairly
free
from
midgets
and
they
established
themselves
in
it
and
liqueurs
and
cigars
accompanied
the
coffee
you
could
actually
see
midgets
laughing
outright
in
the
mist
of
smoke
the
chatter
narrowly
escaped
being
a
din
and
at
intervals
a
diminutive
boy
entered
and
bawled
the
name
of
a
midget
at
the
top
of
his
voice
priam
was
suddenly
electrified
and
oxford
very
alert
noticed
the
electrification
oxford
drank
his
coffee
somewhat
quickly
and
then
he
leaned
forward
a
little
over
the
table
and
put
his
face
nearer
to
priam
and
arranged
his
legs
in
a
truly
comfortable
position
beneath
the
table
and
expelled
a
large
quantity
of
smoke
from
his
cigar
it
was
clearly
the
preliminary
to
a
scene
of
confidence
the
approach
to
the
crisis
to
which
he
had
for
several
hours
been
leading
up
priam
heart
trembled
what
is
your
opinion
he
asked
of
the
ultimate
value
of
farll
pictures
priam
was
in
misery
oxford
manner
was
deferential
amiable
and
expectant
but
priam
did
not
know
what
to
say
he
only
knew
what
he
would
do
if
he
could
have
found
the
courage
to
do
it
run
away
recklessly
unceremoniously
out
of
that
club
i
i
do
know
said
priam
visibly
whitening
because
i
bought
a
goodish
few
farlls
in
my
time
oxford
continued
and
i
must
say
i
sold
them
well
i
only
got
that
one
left
that
i
showed
you
this
morning
and
i
been
wondering
whether
i
should
stick
to
it
and
wait
for
a
possible
further
rise
or
sell
it
at
once
how
much
can
you
sell
it
for
priam
mumbled
i
do
mind
telling
you
said
oxford
that
i
fancy
i
could
sell
it
for
a
couple
of
thousand
it
rather
small
but
it
one
of
the
finest
in
existence
i
should
sell
it
said
priam
scarcely
audible
you
would
well
perhaps
you
right
it
a
question
in
my
mind
whether
some
other
painter
may
not
turn
up
one
of
these
days
who
would
do
that
sort
of
thing
even
better
than
farll
did
it
i
could
imagine
the
possibility
of
a
really
clever
man
coming
along
and
imitating
farll
so
well
that
only
people
like
yourself
and
perhaps
me
could
tell
the
difference
it
just
the
kind
of
work
that
might
be
brilliantly
imitated
if
the
imitator
was
clever
enough
do
you
think
but
what
do
you
mean
asked
priam
perspiring
in
his
back
well
said
oxford
vaguely
one
never
knows
the
style
might
be
imitated
and
the
market
flooded
with
canvases
practically
as
good
as
farll
nobody
might
find
it
out
for
quite
a
long
time
and
then
there
might
be
confusion
in
the
public
mind
followed
by
a
sharp
fall
in
prices
and
the
beauty
of
it
is
that
the
public
would
really
be
any
the
worse
because
an
imitation
that
no
one
can
distinguish
from
the
original
is
naturally
as
good
as
the
original
you
take
me
certainly
a
tremendous
chance
for
a
man
who
could
seize
it
and
why
i
inclined
to
accept
your
advice
and
sell
my
one
remaining
farll
he
smiled
more
and
more
confidentially
his
gaze
was
charged
with
a
secret
meaning
he
seemed
to
be
suggesting
unspeakable
matters
to
priam
that
bright
face
wore
an
expression
which
such
faces
wear
on
such
occasions
an
expression
cheerfully
insinuating
that
after
all
there
is
no
right
and
no
wrong
or
at
least
that
many
things
which
the
ordinary
slave
of
convention
would
consider
to
be
wrong
are
really
right
so
priam
read
the
expression
the
dirty
rascal
wants
me
to
manufacture
imitations
of
myself
for
him
priam
thought
full
of
sudden
hidden
anger
he
known
all
along
that
there
no
difference
between
what
i
sold
him
and
the
picture
already
had
he
wants
to
suggest
that
we
should
come
to
terms
simply
been
playing
a
game
with
me
up
to
now
and
he
said
aloud
i
do
know
that
i
you
to
do
anything
i
not
a
dealer
mr
oxford
he
said
it
in
a
hostile
tone
that
ought
to
have
silenced
oxford
for
ever
but
it
did
not
oxford
curved
away
like
a
skater
into
a
new
figure
and
began
to
expatiate
minutely
upon
the
merits
of
the
volterra
picture
he
analyzed
it
in
so
much
detail
and
lauded
it
with
as
much
justice
as
though
the
picture
was
there
before
them
priam
was
astonished
at
the
man
exactitude
scoundrel
he
knows
a
thing
or
two
reflected
priam
grimly
you
do
think
i
overpraise
it
do
you
maître
oxford
finished
still
smiling
a
little
said
priam
if
only
priam
could
have
run
away
but
he
could
oxford
had
him
well
in
a
corner
no
chance
of
freedom
besides
he
was
over
fifty
and
stout
ah
now
i
was
expecting
you
to
say
that
do
you
mind
telling
me
at
what
period
you
painted
it
oxford
inquired
very
blandly
though
his
hands
were
clasped
in
a
violent
tension
that
forced
the
blood
from
the
region
of
the
this
was
the
crisis
which
oxford
had
been
leading
up
to
all
the
time
oxford
teethy
smile
had
concealed
a
knowledge
of
identity
chapter
x
what
do
you
mean
asked
priam
farll
but
he
put
the
question
weakly
and
he
might
just
as
well
have
said
i
know
what
you
mean
and
i
would
pay
a
million
pounds
or
so
in
order
to
sink
through
the
floor
a
few
minutes
ago
he
would
only
have
paid
five
hundred
pounds
or
so
in
order
to
run
simply
away
now
he
wanted
maskelyne
miracles
to
happen
to
him
the
universe
seemed
to
be
caving
in
about
the
ears
of
priam
farll
oxford
was
still
smiling
smiling
however
as
a
man
holds
his
breath
for
a
wager
you
felt
that
he
could
not
keep
it
up
much
longer
you
priam
farll
are
you
said
oxford
in
a
very
low
voice
what
makes
you
think
i
priam
farll
i
think
you
are
priam
farll
because
you
painted
that
picture
i
bought
from
you
this
morning
and
i
am
sure
that
no
one
but
priam
farll
could
have
painted
it
then
you
been
playing
a
game
with
me
all
morning
please
do
put
it
like
that
oxford
whisperingly
pleaded
i
only
wished
to
feel
my
ground
i
know
that
priam
farll
is
supposed
to
have
been
buried
in
westminster
abbey
but
for
me
the
existence
of
that
picture
of
putney
high
street
obviously
just
painted
is
an
absolute
proof
that
he
is
not
buried
in
westminster
abbey
and
that
he
still
lives
it
is
an
amazing
thing
that
there
should
have
been
a
mistake
at
the
funeral
an
utterly
amazing
thing
which
involves
all
sorts
of
consequences
but
that
not
my
business
of
course
there
must
be
clear
reasons
for
what
occurred
i
am
not
interested
in
them
i
mean
not
professionally
i
merely
argue
when
i
see
a
certain
picture
with
the
paint
still
wet
on
it
picture
was
painted
by
a
certain
painter
i
am
an
expert
and
i
stake
my
reputation
on
it
it
no
use
telling
me
that
the
painter
in
question
died
several
years
ago
and
was
buried
with
national
honours
in
westminster
abbey
i
say
it
have
been
so
i
a
connoisseur
and
if
the
facts
of
his
death
and
burial
do
agree
with
the
result
of
my
connoisseurship
i
say
they
are
facts
i
say
there
been
a
a
misunderstanding
about
er
corpses
now
what
do
you
think
of
my
position
oxford
drummed
lightly
on
the
table
i
do
know
said
priam
which
was
another
lie
you
priam
farll
are
you
oxford
persisted
well
if
you
will
have
it
said
priam
savagely
i
am
and
now
you
know
oxford
let
his
smile
go
he
had
held
it
for
an
incredible
time
he
let
it
go
and
sighed
a
gentle
and
profound
relief
he
had
been
skating
over
the
thinnest
ice
and
had
reached
the
bank
amid
terrific
crackings
and
he
began
to
appreciate
the
extent
of
the
peril
braved
he
had
been
perfectly
sure
of
his
connoisseurship
but
when
one
says
one
is
perfectly
sure
especially
if
one
says
it
with
immense
emphasis
one
always
means
sure
so
it
was
with
oxford
and
really
to
argue
from
the
mere
existence
of
a
picture
that
a
tremendous
deceit
had
been
successfully
practised
upon
the
most
formidable
of
nations
implies
rather
more
than
rashness
on
the
part
of
the
arguer
but
i
do
want
it
to
get
about
said
priam
still
in
a
savage
whisper
and
i
do
want
to
talk
about
it
he
looked
at
the
nearest
midgets
resentfully
suspecting
them
of
eavesdropping
precisely
said
oxford
but
in
a
tone
that
lacked
conviction
it
a
matter
that
only
concerns
me
said
priam
precisely
oxford
repeated
at
least
it
to
concern
only
you
and
i
ca
assure
you
too
positively
that
i
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
want
to
pry
but
you
must
kindly
remember
said
priam
interrupting
that
you
bought
that
picture
this
morning
simply
a
picture
on
its
merits
you
have
no
authority
to
attach
my
name
to
it
and
i
must
ask
you
not
to
do
so
certainly
agreed
oxford
i
bought
it
as
a
masterpiece
and
quite
content
with
my
bargain
i
want
no
signature
i
have
signed
my
pictures
for
twenty
years
said
priam
pardon
me
said
oxford
every
square
inch
of
every
one
is
unmistakably
signed
you
could
not
put
a
brush
on
a
canvas
without
signing
it
it
is
the
privilege
of
only
the
greatest
painters
not
to
put
letters
on
the
corners
of
their
pictures
in
order
to
keep
other
painters
from
taking
the
credit
for
them
afterwards
for
me
all
your
pictures
are
signed
but
there
are
some
people
who
want
more
proof
than
connoisseurship
can
give
and
that
where
the
trouble
is
going
to
be
trouble
said
priam
with
an
intensification
of
his
misery
yes
said
oxford
i
must
tell
you
so
that
you
can
understand
the
situation
he
became
very
solemn
showing
that
he
had
at
last
reached
the
real
point
some
time
ago
a
man
a
little
dealer
came
to
me
and
offered
me
a
picture
that
i
instantly
recognized
as
one
of
yours
i
bought
it
how
much
did
you
pay
for
it
priam
growled
after
a
pause
oxford
said
i
do
mind
giving
you
the
figure
i
paid
fifty
pounds
for
it
did
you
exclaimed
priam
perceiving
that
some
person
or
persons
had
made
four
hundred
per
cent
on
his
work
by
the
time
it
had
arrived
at
a
big
dealer
who
was
the
fellow
oh
a
little
dealer
nobody
jew
of
course
oxford
way
of
saying
was
ineffably
ironic
priam
knew
that
being
a
jew
the
dealer
could
not
be
his
who
was
a
yorkshireman
from
ravensthorpe
oxford
continued
i
sold
that
picture
and
guaranteed
it
to
be
a
priam
farll
the
devil
you
did
yes
i
had
sufficient
confidence
in
my
judgment
who
bought
it
whitney
witt
of
new
york
he
an
old
man
now
of
course
i
expect
you
remember
him
oxford
eyes
twinkled
i
sold
it
to
him
and
of
course
he
accepted
my
guarantee
soon
afterwards
i
had
the
offer
of
other
pictures
obviously
by
you
from
the
same
dealer
and
i
bought
them
i
kept
on
buying
them
i
dare
say
i
bought
forty
altogether
did
your
little
dealer
guess
whose
work
they
were
priam
demanded
suspiciously
not
he
if
he
had
done
do
you
suppose
he
have
parted
with
them
for
fifty
pounds
apiece
mind
at
first
i
thought
i
was
buying
pictures
painted
before
your
supposed
death
i
thought
like
the
rest
of
the
world
that
you
were
in
the
abbey
then
i
began
to
have
doubts
and
one
day
when
a
bit
of
paint
came
off
on
my
thumb
i
can
tell
you
i
was
startled
however
i
stuck
to
my
opinion
and
i
kept
on
guaranteeing
the
pictures
as
farlls
it
never
occurred
to
you
to
make
any
inquiries
yes
it
did
said
oxford
i
did
my
best
to
find
out
from
the
dealer
where
he
got
the
pictures
from
but
he
would
tell
me
well
i
sort
of
scented
a
mystery
now
i
got
no
professional
use
for
mysteries
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
better
just
let
this
one
alone
so
i
did
well
why
did
you
keep
on
leaving
it
alone
priam
asked
because
circumstances
wo
let
me
i
sold
practically
all
those
pictures
to
whitney
witt
it
was
all
right
anyhow
i
thought
it
was
all
right
i
put
parfitts
name
and
reputation
on
their
being
yours
and
then
one
day
i
heard
from
witt
that
on
the
back
of
the
canvas
of
one
of
the
pictures
the
name
of
the
and
a
date
had
been
stamped
with
a
rubber
stamp
and
that
the
date
was
after
your
supposed
burial
and
that
his
london
solicitors
had
made
inquiries
from
the
people
here
and
these
people
were
prepared
to
prove
that
the
canvas
was
made
after
priam
farll
funeral
you
see
the
fix
priam
did
my
reputation
parfitts
is
at
stake
if
those
pictures
are
by
you
i
a
swindler
parfitts
name
is
gone
for
ever
and
there
be
the
greatest
scandal
that
ever
was
witt
is
threatening
proceedings
i
offered
to
take
the
whole
lot
back
at
the
price
he
paid
me
without
any
commission
but
he
wo
he
an
old
man
a
bit
of
a
maniac
i
expect
and
he
wo
he
angry
he
thinks
he
been
swindled
and
what
he
says
is
that
he
going
to
see
the
thing
through
i
got
to
prove
to
him
that
the
pictures
are
yours
i
got
to
show
him
what
grounds
i
had
for
giving
my
guarantee
well
to
cut
a
long
story
short
i
found
you
i
glad
to
say
he
sighed
again
look
here
said
priam
how
much
has
witt
paid
you
altogether
for
my
pictures
after
a
pause
oxford
said
i
do
mind
giving
you
the
figure
he
paid
me
thousand
pounds
odd
he
smiled
as
if
to
excuse
himself
when
priam
farll
reflected
that
he
had
received
about
four
hundred
pounds
for
those
pictures
vastly
less
than
one
per
cent
of
what
the
shiny
and
prosperous
dealer
had
ultimately
disposed
of
them
for
the
traditional
fury
of
the
artist
against
the
dealer
of
the
producer
against
the
parasitic
middleman
sprang
into
flame
in
his
heart
up
till
then
he
had
never
had
any
serious
cause
of
complaint
against
his
dealers
extremely
successful
artists
seldom
have
now
he
saw
dealers
as
the
ordinary
painters
see
them
to
be
the
authors
of
all
evil
now
he
understood
by
what
methods
oxford
had
achieved
his
splendid
car
clothes
club
and
minions
these
things
were
earned
not
by
oxford
but
oxford
in
dingy
studios
even
in
attics
by
shabby
industrious
painters
oxford
was
nothing
but
an
opulent
thief
a
grinder
of
the
face
of
genius
oxford
was
in
a
word
the
spawn
of
the
devil
and
priam
silently
but
sincerely
consigned
him
to
his
proper
place
it
was
excessively
unjust
of
priam
nobody
had
asked
priam
to
die
nobody
had
asked
him
to
give
up
his
identity
if
he
had
latterly
been
receiving
tens
instead
of
thousands
for
his
pictures
the
fault
was
his
alone
oxford
had
only
bought
and
only
sold
which
was
his
true
function
but
oxford
sin
in
priam
eyes
was
the
sin
of
having
been
right
it
would
have
needed
less
insight
than
oxford
had
at
his
disposal
to
see
that
priam
farll
was
taking
the
news
very
badly
for
both
our
sakes
said
oxford
persuasively
i
think
it
will
be
advisable
for
you
to
put
me
in
a
position
to
prove
that
my
guarantee
to
witt
was
justified
why
for
both
our
sakes
because
well
i
shall
be
delighted
to
pay
you
say
thousand
pounds
in
acknowledgment
of
er
he
stopped
probably
he
had
instantly
perceived
that
he
was
committing
a
disastrous
error
of
tact
either
he
should
have
offered
nothing
or
he
should
have
offered
the
whole
sum
he
had
received
less
a
small
commission
to
suggest
dividing
equally
with
priam
was
the
instinctive
impulse
the
fatal
folly
of
a
born
dealer
and
oxford
was
a
born
dealer
i
wo
accept
a
penny
said
priam
and
i
ca
help
you
in
any
way
i
afraid
i
must
go
now
i
late
as
it
is
his
cold
resistless
fury
drove
him
forward
and
without
the
slightest
regard
for
the
amenities
of
clubs
he
left
the
table
oxford
becoming
more
and
more
the
dealer
rose
and
followed
him
even
directed
him
to
the
gigantic
murmuring
the
while
soft
persuasions
and
pacifications
in
priam
ear
there
may
be
an
action
in
the
courts
said
oxford
in
the
grand
entrance
hall
and
your
testimony
would
be
indispensable
to
me
i
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
giant
at
the
door
could
scarce
open
the
gigantic
portal
quickly
enough
for
him
he
fled
fled
surrounded
by
nightmare
visions
of
horrible
publicity
in
a
unthinkable
tortures
he
damned
oxford
to
the
nethermost
places
and
swore
that
he
would
not
lift
a
finger
to
save
oxford
from
penal
servitude
for
life
he
stood
on
the
kerb
of
the
monument
talking
to
himself
savagely
at
any
rate
he
was
safely
outside
the
monument
with
its
pullulating
population
of
midgets
creeping
over
its
carpets
and
lounging
insignificant
on
its
couches
he
could
not
remember
clearly
what
had
occurred
since
the
moment
of
his
getting
up
from
the
table
he
could
not
remember
seeing
anything
or
anyone
on
his
way
out
but
he
could
remember
the
persuasive
deferential
voice
of
oxford
following
him
persistently
as
far
as
the
giant
door
in
recollection
that
club
was
like
an
abode
of
black
magic
to
him
it
seemed
so
hideously
alive
in
its
deadness
and
its
doings
were
so
absurd
and
mysterious
silence
silence
commanded
the
white
papers
in
one
vast
chamber
and
in
another
babel
existed
and
then
that
terrible
mute
with
the
high
unscalable
mantelpieces
that
no
midget
could
ever
reach
he
kept
uttering
the
most
dreadful
judgments
on
the
club
and
on
oxford
in
quite
audible
tones
oblivious
of
the
street
he
was
aroused
by
a
rather
scared
man
saluting
him
it
was
oxford
chauffeur
waiting
patiently
till
his
master
should
be
ready
to
the
wheeled
salon
the
chauffeur
apparently
thought
him
either
demented
or
inebriated
but
his
sole
duty
was
to
salute
and
he
did
nothing
else
quite
forgetting
that
this
chauffeur
was
a
priam
immediately
turned
upon
his
heel
and
hurried
down
the
street
at
the
corner
of
the
street
was
a
large
bank
and
priam
acquiring
the
reckless
courage
of
the
soldier
in
battle
entered
the
bank
he
had
never
been
in
a
london
bank
before
at
first
it
reminded
him
of
the
club
with
the
addition
of
an
enormous
placard
giving
the
day
of
the
month
as
a
mystical
number
and
other
placards
displaying
solitary
letters
of
the
alphabet
then
he
saw
that
it
was
a
huge
menagerie
in
which
highly
trained
young
men
of
assorted
sizes
and
years
were
confined
in
stout
cages
of
wire
and
mahogany
he
stamped
straight
to
a
cage
with
a
hole
in
it
and
threw
down
the
cheque
for
five
hundred
pounds
defiantly
next
desk
please
said
a
mouth
over
a
high
collar
and
a
green
tie
behind
the
grating
and
a
disdainful
hand
pushed
the
cheque
back
towards
priam
next
desk
repeated
priam
dashed
but
furious
this
is
the
a
to
m
desk
said
the
mouth
then
priam
understood
the
solitary
letters
and
he
rushed
with
a
new
accession
of
fury
to
the
adjoining
cage
where
another
disdainful
hand
picked
up
the
cheque
and
turned
it
over
with
an
air
of
saying
fishy
this
and
it
is
endorsed
said
another
mouth
over
another
high
collar
and
green
tie
the
second
disdainful
hand
pushed
the
cheque
back
again
to
priam
as
though
it
had
been
a
begging
circular
oh
if
that
all
said
priam
almost
speechless
from
anger
have
you
got
such
a
thing
as
a
pen
he
was
behaving
in
an
extremely
unreasonable
manner
he
had
no
right
to
visit
his
spleen
on
a
perfectly
innocent
bank
that
paid
per
cent
to
its
shareholders
and
a
thousand
a
year
each
to
its
directors
and
what
trifle
was
left
over
to
its
men
in
rages
but
priam
was
not
like
you
or
me
he
did
not
invariably
act
according
to
reason
he
could
not
be
angry
with
one
man
at
once
nor
even
with
one
building
at
once
when
he
was
angry
he
was
inclusively
and
miscellaneously
angry
and
the
sun
moon
and
stars
did
not
escape
after
he
had
endorsed
the
cheque
the
disdainful
hand
clawed
it
up
once
more
and
directed
upon
its
obverse
and
upon
its
reverse
a
battery
of
suspicions
then
a
pair
of
eyes
glanced
with
critical
distrust
at
so
much
of
priam
person
as
was
visible
then
the
eyes
moved
back
the
mouth
opened
in
a
brief
word
and
lo
there
were
four
eyes
and
two
mouths
over
the
cheque
and
four
for
an
instant
on
priam
priam
expected
some
one
to
call
for
a
policeman
in
spite
of
himself
he
felt
guilty
or
anyhow
dubious
it
was
the
grossest
insult
to
him
to
throw
doubt
on
the
cheque
and
to
examine
him
in
that
frigid
shamelessly
disillusioned
manner
you
mr
leek
a
mouth
moved
yes
very
slowly
how
would
you
like
this
i
thank
you
to
give
it
me
in
notes
answered
priam
haughtily
when
the
disdainful
hand
had
counted
twice
every
corner
of
a
pile
of
notes
and
had
dropped
the
notes
one
by
one
with
a
peculiar
snapping
sound
of
paper
in
front
of
priam
priam
crushed
them
together
and
crammed
them
without
any
ceremony
and
without
gratitude
to
the
giver
into
the
right
pocket
of
his
trousers
and
he
stamped
out
of
the
building
with
curses
on
his
lips
still
he
felt
better
he
felt
assuaged
to
cultivate
and
nourish
a
grievance
when
you
have
five
hundred
pounds
in
your
pocket
in
cash
is
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
visit
to
the
he
gradually
grew
calmer
by
dint
of
walking
aimless
fast
walking
with
a
rapt
expression
of
the
eyes
that
on
crowded
pavements
cleared
the
way
for
him
more
effectually
than
a
shouting
footman
and
then
he
debouched
unexpectedly
on
to
the
embankment
dusk
was
already
falling
on
the
noble
curve
of
the
thames
and
the
mighty
panorama
stretched
before
him
in
a
manner
mysteriously
impressive
which
has
made
poets
of
less
poetic
men
than
priam
farll
grand
hotels
offices
of
millionaires
and
of
governments
grand
hotels
swards
and
mullioned
windows
of
the
law
grand
hotels
the
terrific
arches
of
termini
cathedral
domes
houses
of
parliament
and
grand
hotels
rose
darkly
around
him
on
the
arc
of
the
river
against
the
dark
violet
murk
of
the
sky
huge
trams
swam
past
him
like
glass
houses
and
hansoms
shot
past
the
trams
and
automobiles
past
the
hansoms
and
phantom
barges
swirled
down
on
the
full
ebb
threading
holes
in
bridges
as
cotton
threads
a
needle
it
was
london
and
the
roar
of
london
majestic
imperial
and
lo
earlier
than
the
earliest
municipal
light
an
unseen
hand
the
hand
of
destiny
printed
a
writing
on
the
wall
of
vague
gloom
that
was
beginning
to
hide
the
opposite
bank
and
the
writing
said
that
shipton
tea
was
the
best
and
then
the
hand
wiped
largely
out
that
message
and
wrote
in
another
spot
that
macdonnell
whisky
was
the
best
and
so
these
two
doctrines
in
their
intermittent
pyrotechnics
continued
to
give
the
lie
to
each
other
under
the
deepening
night
quite
five
minutes
passed
before
priam
perceived
between
the
altercating
doctrines
the
high
summit
of
a
building
which
was
unfamiliar
to
him
it
looked
serenely
and
immaterially
beautiful
in
the
evening
twilight
and
as
he
was
close
to
waterloo
bridge
his
curiosity
concerning
beauty
took
him
over
to
the
south
bank
of
the
thames
after
losing
himself
in
the
purlieus
of
waterloo
station
he
at
last
discovered
the
rear
of
the
building
yes
it
was
a
beautiful
thing
its
tower
climbed
in
several
coloured
storeys
diminishing
till
it
expired
in
a
winged
figure
on
the
sky
and
below
the
building
was
broad
and
massive
with
a
frontage
of
pillars
over
great
arched
windows
two
cranes
stuck
their
arms
out
from
the
general
mass
and
the
whole
enterprise
was
guarded
in
a
hedge
of
hoardings
through
the
narrow
doorway
in
the
hoarding
came
the
flare
and
the
hissing
of
a
light
priam
farll
glanced
timidly
within
the
interior
was
immense
in
a
sort
of
court
of
honour
a
group
of
muscular
hairy
males
silhouetted
against
an
illuminated
latticework
of
scaffolding
were
chipping
and
paring
at
huge
blocks
of
stone
it
was
a
subject
for
a
rembrandt
a
fat
untidy
man
meditatively
approached
the
doorway
he
had
a
roll
of
tracing
papers
in
his
hand
and
the
end
of
a
long
thick
pencil
in
his
mouth
he
was
the
man
who
interpreted
the
dreams
of
the
architect
to
the
dreamy
british
artisan
experience
of
life
had
made
him
somewhat
brusque
look
here
he
said
to
priam
what
the
devil
do
you
want
what
the
devil
do
i
want
repeated
priam
who
had
not
yet
altogether
fallen
away
from
his
mood
of
universal
defiance
i
only
want
to
know
what
the
this
building
is
the
fat
man
was
a
little
startled
he
took
his
pencil
from
his
mouth
and
spit
it
the
new
picture
gallery
built
under
the
will
of
that
there
priam
farll
i
should
ha
thought
you
ha
known
that
priam
lips
trembled
on
the
verge
of
an
exclamation
see
that
the
fat
man
pursued
pointing
to
a
small
board
on
the
hoarding
the
board
said
no
hands
wanted
the
fat
man
coldly
scrutinized
priam
appearance
from
his
greenish
hat
to
his
baggy
creased
boots
priam
walked
away
he
was
dumbfounded
then
he
was
furious
again
he
perfectly
saw
the
humour
of
the
situation
but
it
was
not
the
kind
of
humour
that
induced
rollicking
laughter
he
was
furious
and
employed
the
language
of
fury
when
it
is
not
overheard
absorbed
by
his
craft
of
painting
as
in
the
old
continental
days
he
had
long
since
ceased
to
read
the
newspapers
and
though
he
had
not
forgotten
his
bequest
to
the
nation
he
had
never
thought
of
it
as
taking
architectural
shape
he
was
not
aware
of
his
cousin
duncan
activities
for
the
perpetuation
of
the
family
name
the
thing
staggered
him
the
probabilities
of
the
strange
consequences
of
dead
actions
swept
against
him
and
overwhelmed
him
once
years
ago
and
years
ago
in
a
resentful
mood
he
had
written
a
few
lines
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
signed
them
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
then
nothing
nothing
whatever
for
two
decades
the
paper
slept
and
now
this
this
tremendous
concrete
result
in
the
heart
of
london
it
was
incredible
it
passed
the
bounds
even
of
lawful
magic
his
palace
his
museum
the
fruit
of
a
captious
hour
ah
but
he
was
furious
like
every
ageing
artist
of
genuine
accomplishment
he
knew
none
better
that
there
is
no
satisfaction
save
the
satisfaction
of
fatigue
after
honest
endeavour
he
knew
none
better
that
wealth
and
glory
and
fine
clothes
are
nought
and
that
striving
is
all
he
had
never
been
happier
than
during
the
last
two
years
yet
the
finest
souls
have
their
reactions
their
rebellions
against
wise
reason
and
priam
soul
was
in
insurrection
then
he
wanted
wealth
and
glory
and
fine
clothes
once
more
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
out
of
the
world
and
that
he
must
return
to
it
the
covert
insults
of
oxford
rankled
and
stung
and
the
fat
foreman
had
mistaken
him
for
a
workman
cadging
for
a
job
he
walked
rapidly
to
the
bridge
and
took
a
cab
to
conduit
street
where
dwelt
a
firm
of
tailors
with
whose
paris
branch
he
had
had
dealings
in
his
dandiacal
past
an
odd
impulse
perhaps
but
natural
a
lighted
far
to
his
left
as
the
cab
rolled
across
the
bridge
showed
that
a
legislative
providence
was
watching
over
israel
on
the
i
bet
the
building
alone
wo
cost
less
than
seventy
thousand
pounds
he
said
he
was
back
again
with
alice
in
the
intimacy
of
werter
road
and
relating
to
her
in
part
the
adventures
of
the
latter
portion
of
the
day
he
had
reached
home
long
after
she
with
her
natural
sagacity
had
not
waited
tea
for
him
now
she
had
prepared
a
rather
special
tea
for
the
adventurer
and
she
was
sitting
opposite
to
him
at
the
little
table
with
nothing
to
do
but
listen
and
refill
his
cup
well
she
said
mildly
and
without
the
least
surprise
at
his
figures
i
do
know
what
he
could
have
been
thinking
of
your
priam
farll
i
call
it
just
silly
it
is
as
if
there
was
enough
already
when
what
there
are
are
so
full
that
you
ca
get
in
then
it
will
be
time
enough
to
think
about
fresh
ones
i
been
to
the
national
gallery
twice
and
upon
my
word
i
was
almost
the
only
person
there
and
it
free
too
people
do
if
they
did
go
who
ever
saw
a
empty
or
peter
robinson
and
you
have
to
pay
there
silly
i
call
it
why
could
he
have
left
his
money
to
you
or
at
any
rate
to
the
hospitals
or
something
of
that
no
it
silly
it
scandalous
it
ought
to
be
stopped
now
priam
had
resolved
that
evening
to
make
a
serious
gallant
attempt
to
convince
his
wife
of
his
own
identity
he
was
approaching
the
critical
point
this
speech
of
hers
intimidated
him
rather
complicated
his
difficulties
but
he
determined
to
proceed
bravely
have
you
put
sugar
in
this
he
asked
yes
she
said
but
you
forgotten
to
stir
it
i
stir
it
for
you
a
charming
wifely
attention
it
enheartened
him
i
say
alice
he
said
as
she
stirred
you
remember
when
first
i
told
you
i
could
paint
yes
she
said
well
at
first
you
thought
i
was
daft
you
thought
my
mind
was
wandering
did
you
no
she
said
i
only
thought
you
got
a
bee
in
your
bonnet
she
smiled
demurely
well
i
had
had
i
seeing
the
money
you
made
i
should
just
say
you
had
she
handsomely
admitted
where
we
should
be
without
it
i
do
know
you
were
wrong
were
you
and
i
was
right
of
course
she
beamed
and
do
you
remember
that
time
i
told
you
i
was
really
priam
farll
she
nodded
reluctantly
you
thought
i
was
absolutely
mad
oh
you
need
deny
it
i
could
see
well
enough
what
your
thoughts
were
i
thought
you
were
quite
well
she
said
frankly
but
i
was
my
child
now
i
got
to
tell
you
again
that
i
am
priam
farll
honestly
i
wish
i
was
but
i
am
the
deuce
of
it
is
that
that
fellow
that
came
here
this
morning
has
found
it
out
and
there
going
to
be
trouble
at
least
there
has
been
trouble
and
there
may
be
more
she
was
impressed
she
knew
not
what
to
say
but
priam
he
paid
me
five
hundred
for
that
picture
i
just
finished
five
hund
priam
snatched
the
notes
from
his
pocket
and
with
a
gesture
pardonably
dramatic
he
bade
her
count
them
count
them
he
repeated
when
she
hesitated
is
it
right
he
asked
when
she
had
finished
oh
it
right
enough
she
agreed
but
priam
i
do
like
having
all
this
money
in
the
house
you
ought
to
have
called
and
put
it
in
the
bank
dash
the
bank
he
exclaimed
just
keep
on
listening
to
me
and
try
to
persuade
yourself
i
not
mad
i
admit
i
a
bit
shy
and
it
was
all
on
account
of
that
that
i
let
that
d
d
valet
of
mine
be
buried
as
me
you
need
tell
me
you
shy
she
smiled
all
putney
knows
shy
i
not
so
sure
about
that
he
tossed
his
head
then
he
began
at
the
beginning
and
recounted
to
her
in
detail
the
historic
night
and
morning
at
selwood
terrace
with
a
psychological
description
of
his
feelings
he
convinced
her
in
less
than
ten
minutes
with
the
powerful
aid
of
five
hundred
pounds
in
banknotes
that
he
in
truth
was
priam
farll
and
he
waited
for
her
to
express
an
exceeding
astonishment
and
satisfaction
well
of
course
if
you
are
you
are
she
observed
simply
regarding
him
with
benevolent
possessive
glances
across
the
table
the
fact
was
that
she
did
not
deal
in
names
she
dealt
in
realities
he
was
her
reality
and
so
long
as
he
did
not
change
visibly
or
actually
so
long
as
he
remained
he
she
did
not
much
mind
who
he
was
she
added
but
i
really
do
know
what
you
were
of
henry
to
do
such
a
thing
neither
do
i
he
muttered
then
he
disclosed
to
her
the
whole
chicanery
of
oxford
it
a
good
thing
you
ordered
those
new
clothes
she
said
why
because
of
the
trial
the
trial
between
oxford
and
witt
what
that
got
to
do
with
me
they
make
you
give
evidence
but
i
sha
give
evidence
i
told
oxford
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
at
all
suppose
they
make
you
they
can
you
know
with
a
sub
sub
something
i
forget
its
name
then
you
to
go
in
the
me
in
the
he
murmured
undone
yes
she
said
i
expect
it
be
very
provoking
indeed
but
want
a
new
suit
for
it
so
i
glad
you
ordered
one
when
are
you
going
to
try
on
chapter
xi
one
night
in
the
following
june
priam
and
alice
refrained
from
going
to
bed
alice
dozed
for
an
hour
or
so
on
the
sofa
and
priam
read
by
her
side
in
an
and
about
two
just
before
the
first
beginnings
of
dawn
they
stimulated
themselves
into
a
feverish
activity
beneath
the
parlour
gas
alice
prepared
tea
and
eggs
passing
briskly
from
room
to
room
alice
also
ran
upstairs
cast
a
few
more
things
into
a
valise
and
a
bag
already
partially
packed
and
locking
both
receptacles
carried
them
downstairs
meantime
the
whole
of
priam
energy
was
employed
in
having
a
bath
and
in
shaving
blood
was
shed
as
was
but
natural
at
that
ineffable
hour
while
priam
consumed
the
food
she
had
prepared
alice
was
continually
darting
to
and
fro
in
the
house
at
one
moment
after
an
absence
she
would
come
into
the
parlour
with
a
mouthful
of
hatpins
at
another
she
would
rush
out
to
assure
herself
that
the
indispensable
keys
of
the
valise
and
bag
with
her
purse
were
on
the
where
they
could
not
be
forgotten
between
her
excursions
she
would
drink
thirty
drops
of
tea
now
priam
she
said
at
length
the
water
hot
have
you
finished
it
be
getting
light
soon
water
hot
he
queried
at
a
loss
yes
she
said
to
wash
up
these
things
of
course
you
do
suppose
i
going
to
leave
a
lot
of
dirty
things
in
the
house
do
you
while
doing
that
you
might
stick
labels
on
the
luggage
they
wo
need
to
be
labelled
he
argued
we
shall
take
them
with
us
in
the
carriage
oh
priam
she
protested
how
tiresome
you
are
i
travelled
more
than
you
have
he
tried
to
laugh
yes
and
fine
travelling
it
must
have
been
too
however
if
you
mind
the
luggage
being
lost
i
do
during
this
she
was
collecting
the
crockery
on
a
tray
with
which
tray
she
whizzed
out
of
the
room
in
ten
minutes
hatted
heavily
veiled
and
gloved
she
cautiously
opened
the
front
door
and
peeped
forth
into
the
lamplit
street
she
peered
to
right
and
to
left
then
she
went
as
far
as
the
gate
and
peered
again
is
it
all
right
whispered
priam
who
was
behind
her
yes
i
think
so
she
whispered
priam
came
out
of
the
house
with
the
bag
in
one
hand
and
the
valise
in
the
other
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
a
stick
under
his
arm
and
an
overcoat
on
his
shoulder
alice
ran
up
the
steps
gazed
within
the
house
pulled
the
door
to
silently
and
locked
it
then
beneath
the
summer
stars
she
and
priam
hastened
furtively
as
though
the
luggage
had
contained
swag
up
werter
road
towards
oxford
road
when
they
had
turned
the
corner
they
felt
very
much
relieved
they
had
escaped
it
was
their
second
attempt
the
first
made
in
daylight
had
completely
failed
their
cab
had
been
followed
to
paddington
station
by
three
other
cabs
containing
the
representatives
and
the
cameras
of
three
sunday
newspapers
a
journalist
had
deliberately
accompanied
priam
to
the
booking
office
had
heard
him
ask
for
two
seconds
to
weymouth
and
had
bought
a
second
to
weymouth
himself
they
had
gone
to
weymouth
but
as
within
two
hours
of
their
arrival
weymouth
had
become
even
more
impossible
than
werter
road
they
had
ignominiously
but
wisely
come
back
werter
road
had
developed
into
the
most
celebrated
thoroughfare
in
london
its
photograph
had
appeared
in
scores
of
newspapers
with
a
cross
marking
the
abode
of
priam
and
alice
it
was
beset
and
infested
by
journalists
of
several
nationalities
from
morn
till
night
cameras
were
as
common
in
it
as
and
a
famous
descriptive
reporter
of
the
had
got
lodgings
at
a
high
figure
exactly
opposite
no
priam
and
alice
could
do
nothing
without
publicity
and
if
it
would
be
an
exaggeration
to
assert
that
evening
papers
appeared
with
news
leek
went
out
shopping
the
exaggeration
would
not
be
very
extravagant
for
a
fortnight
priam
had
not
been
beyond
the
door
during
daylight
it
was
alice
who
alarmed
by
priam
pallid
cheeks
and
tightened
nerves
had
devised
the
plan
of
flight
before
the
early
summer
dawn
they
reached
east
putney
station
of
which
the
gates
were
closed
the
first
workman
train
being
not
yet
due
and
there
they
stood
not
another
human
being
was
abroad
only
the
clock
of
bude
was
faithfully
awakening
every
soul
within
a
radius
of
two
hundred
yards
each
quarter
of
an
hour
then
a
porter
came
and
opened
the
gate
it
was
still
exceedingly
early
and
priam
booked
for
waterloo
in
triumph
oh
cried
alice
as
they
mounted
the
stairs
i
quite
forgot
to
draw
up
the
blinds
at
the
front
of
the
house
and
she
stopped
on
the
stairs
what
did
you
want
to
draw
up
the
blinds
for
if
they
down
everybody
will
know
instantly
that
we
gone

said
sharply
in

voice
the

of

face

realized
that

oh
very

soothed
him
by
her
amiable
obedience
in

quarter
of
an
hour

were

to

days
respite
nation
the
interest
of
the
united
kingdom
in
the
unique
case
of
witt
parfitts
had
already
reached
apparently
the
highest
possible
degree
of
intensity
and
there
was
reason
for
the
kingdom
passionate
curiosity
whitney
witt
the
plaintiff
had
come
over
to
england
with
his
eccentricities
his
retinue
his
extreme
wealth
and
his
failing
eyesight
specially
to
fight
parfitts
a
figure
this
man
once
a
connoisseur
who
from
mere
habit
continued
to
buy
expensive
pictures
when
he
could
no
longer
see
them
whitney
witt
was
implacably
set
against
parfitts
because
he
was
convinced
that
oxford
had
sought
to
take
advantage
of
his
blindness
there
he
was
conducting
his
action
regardless
of
his
blindness
there
he
was
conducting
his
action
regardless
of
expense
his
apartments
and
his
regal
daily
existence
at
the
grand
babylon
alone
cost
a
fabulous
sum
which
may
be
precisely
ascertained
by
reference
to
illustrated
articles
in
the
papers
then
oxford
the
youngish
jew
who
had
acquired
parfitts
who
was
parfitts
also
cut
a
picturesque
figure
on
the
face
of
london
he
too
was
spending
money
with
both
hands
for
parfitts
itself
was
at
stake
last
and
most
disturbing
was
the
individual
looming
mysteriously
in
the
background
the
inexplicable
man
who
lived
in
werter
road
and
whose
identity
would
be
decided
by
the
judgment
in
the
case
of
witt
parfitts
if
witt
won
his
action
then
parfitts
might
retire
from
business
oxford
would
probably
go
to
prison
for
having
sold
goods
on
false
pretences
and
the
name
of
henry
leek
valet
would
be
added
to
the
list
of
adventurous
scoundrels
who
have
pretended
to
be
their
masters
but
if
witt
should
lose
then
what
a
complication
and
what
further
enigmas
to
be
solved
if
witt
should
lose
the
national
funeral
of
priam
farll
had
been
a
fraudulent
farce
a
common
valet
lay
under
the
hallowed
stones
of
the
abbey
and
europe
had
mourned
in
vain
if
witt
should
lose
a
gigantic
and
unprecedented
swindle
had
been
practised
upon
the
nation
then
the
question
would
arise
why
hence
it
was
not
surprising
that
popular
interest
nourished
by
an
indefatigable
and
excessively
enterprising
press
should
have
mounted
till
no
one
would
have
believed
that
it
could
mount
any
more
but
the
evasion
from
werter
road
on
that
june
morning
intensified
the
interest
enormously
of
course
owing
to
the
drawn
blinds
it
soon
became
known
and
the
bloodhounds
of
the
sunday
papers
were
sniffing
along
the
platforms
of
all
the
termini
in
london
priam
departure
greatly
prejudiced
the
cause
of
oxford
especially
when
the
bloodhounds
failed
and
priam
persisted
in
his
invisibility
if
a
man
was
an
honest
man
why
should
he
flee
the
public
gaze
and
in
the
night
there
was
but
a
step
from
the
posing
of
this
question
to
the
inevitable
inference
that
oxford
line
of
defence
was
really
too
fantastic
for
credence
certainly
organs
of
vast
circulation
while
repeating
that
as
the
action
was
they
could
say
nothing
about
it
had
already
tried
the
action
several
times
in
their
impartial
columns
and
they
now
tried
it
again
with
the
entire
public
as
jury
and
in
three
days
priam
had
definitely
become
a
criminal
in
the
public
eye
a
criminal
flying
from
justice
useless
to
assert
that
he
was
simply
a
witness
subpoenaed
to
give
evidence
at
the
trial
he
had
transgressed
the
unwritten
law
of
the
english
constitution
that
a
person
prominent
in
a
belongs
for
the
time
being
not
to
himself
but
to
the
nation
at
large
he
had
no
claim
to
privacy
in
surreptitiously
obtaining
seclusion
he
was
merely
robbing
the
public
and
the
public
press
of
their
inalienable
right
who
could
deny
now
the
reiterated
statement
that
was
a
bigamist
it
came
to
be
said
that
he
must
be
on
his
way
to
south
america
then
the
public
read
avidly
articles
by
specially
retained
barristers
on
the
extradition
treaties
with
brazil
argentina
ecuador
chili
paraguay
and
uruguay
the
curates
matthew
and
henry
preached
to
crowded
congregations
at
putney
and
bermondsey
and
were
reported
verbatim
in
the
voice
sermon
and
other
messengers
of
light
and
gradually
the
nose
of
england
bent
closer
and
closer
to
its
newspaper
of
a
morning
and
coffee
went
cold
and
bacon
fat
congealed
from
the
isle
of
wight
to
hexham
while
the
latest
rumours
were
being
swallowed
it
promised
to
be
stupendous
did
the
case
of
witt
parfitts
it
promised
to
be
one
of
those
cases
that
alone
make
life
worth
living
that
alone
compensate
for
the
horrors
of
climate
in
england
and
then
the
day
of
hearing
arrived
and
the
afternoon
papers
which
appear
at
nine
in
the
morning
announced
that
henry
leek
or
priam
farll
according
to
your
wish
and
his
wife
or
his
female
companion
and
willing
victim
had
returned
to
werter
road
and
england
held
its
breath
and
even
scotland
paused
expectant
and
ireland
stirred
in
its
celtic
dream
of
two
the
theatre
in
which
the
emotional
drama
of
witt
parfitts
was
to
be
played
lacked
the
usual
characteristics
of
a
modern
place
of
entertainment
it
was
far
too
high
for
its
width
and
breadth
it
was
badly
illuminated
it
was
draughty
in
winter
and
stuffy
in
summer
being
completely
deprived
of
ventilation
had
it
been
under
the
control
of
the
county
council
it
would
have
been
instantly
condemned
as
dangerous
in
case
of
fire
for
its
gangways
were
always
encumbered
and
its
exits
of
a
mediaeval
complexity
it
had
no
stage
no
footlights
and
all
its
seats
were
of
naked
wood
except
one
this
unique
seat
was
occupied
by
the
principal
player
who
wore
a
humorous
wig
and
a
brilliant
and
expensive
scarlet
costume
he
was
a
fairly
able
judge
but
he
had
mistaken
his
vocation
his
rare
talent
for
making
jokes
would
have
brought
him
a
fortune
in
the
world
of
musical
comedy
his
salary
was
a
hundred
a
week
better
comedians
have
earned
less
on
the
present
occasion
he
was
in
the
midst
of
a
double
row
of
fashionable
hats
and
beneath
the
hats
were
the
faces
of
fourteen
feminine
relatives
and
acquaintances
these
hats
performed
the
function
of
the
house
the
principal
player
endeavoured
to
behave
as
though
under
the
illusion
that
he
was
alone
in
his
glory
but
he
failed
there
were
four
other
leading
actors
pennington
and
vodrey
engaged
by
the
plaintiff
and
cass
and
crepitude
engaged
by
the
defendant
these
artistes
were
the
stars
of
their
profession
nominally
less
glittering
but
really
far
more
glittering
than
the
player
in
scarlet
their
wigs
were
of
inferior
quality
to
his
and
their
costumes
shabby
but
they
did
not
mind
for
whereas
he
got
a
hundred
a
week
they
each
got
a
hundred
a
day
three
junior
performers
received
ten
guineas
a
day
apiece
one
of
them
held
a
watching
brief
for
the
dean
and
chapter
of
the
abbey
who
being
members
of
a
christian
fraternity
were
pained
and
horrified
by
the
implication
that
they
had
given
interment
to
a
valet
and
who
were
determined
to
resist
exhumation
at
all
hazards
the
supers
in
the
drama
whose
business
it
was
to
whisper
to
each
other
and
to
the
players
consisted
of
solicitors
solicitors
clerks
and
experts
their
combined
emoluments
worked
out
at
the
rate
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
day
twelve
excellent
men
in
the
received
between
them
about
as
much
as
would
have
kept
a
alive
for
five
minutes
the
total
expenses
of
production
thus
amounted
to
something
like
six
or
seven
hundred
pounds
a
day
the
preliminary
expenses
had
run
into
several
thousands
the
enterprise
could
have
been
made
remunerative
by
hiring
for
it
convent
garden
theatre
and
selling
stalls
as
for
tettrazzini
and
caruso
but
in
the
absurd
auditorium
chosen
crammed
though
it
was
to
the
perilous
doors
the
loss
was
necessarily
terrific
fortunately
the
affair
was
subsidized
not
merely
by
the
state
but
also
by
those
two
wealthy
capitalists
whitney
witt
and
oxford
and
therefore
the
management
were
in
a
position
to
ignore
paltry
financial
considerations
and
to
practise
art
for
art
sake
in
opening
the
case
pennington
gave
instant
proof
of
his
astounding
histrionic
powers
he
began
calmly
colloquially
treating
the
jury
as
friends
of
his
boyhood
and
the
judge
as
a
gifted
uncle
and
stated
in
simple
language
that
whitney
witt
was
claiming
thousand
pounds
from
the
defendants
money
paid
for
worthless
pictures
palmed
off
upon
the
myopic
and
venerable
plaintiff
as
masterpieces
he
recounted
the
life
and
death
of
the
great
painter
priam
farll
and
his
solemn
burial
and
the
tears
of
the
whole
world
he
dwelt
upon
the
genius
of
priam
farll
and
then
upon
the
confiding
nature
of
the
plaintiff
then
he
inquired
who
could
blame
the
plaintiff
for
his
confidence
in
the
uprightness
of
a
firm
with
such
a
name
as
parfitts
and
then
he
explained
by
what
accident
of
a
on
a
canvas
it
had
been
discovered
that
the
pictures
guaranteed
to
be
by
priam
farll
were
painted
after
priam
farll
death
he
proceeded
with
no
variation
of
tone
the
explanation
is
simplicity
itself
priam
farll
was
not
really
dead
it
was
his
valet
who
died
quite
naturally
quite
comprehensibly
the
great
genius
priam
farll
wished
to
pass
the
remainder
of
his
career
as
a
humble
valet
he
deceived
everybody
the
doctor
his
cousin
duncan
farll
the
public
authorities
the
dean
and
chapter
of
the
abbey
the
nation
in
fact
the
entire
world
as
henry
leek
he
married
and
as
henry
leek
he
recommenced
the
art
of
painting
in
putney
he
carried
on
the
vocation
several
years
without
arousing
the
suspicions
of
a
single
person
and
then
by
a
curious
coincidence
immediately
after
my
client
threatened
an
action
against
the
defendant
he
displayed
himself
in
his
true
identity
as
priam
farll
such
is
the
simple
explanation
said
pennington
and
added
which
you
will
hear
presently
from
the
defendant
doubtless
it
will
commend
itself
to
you
as
experienced
men
of
the
world
you
can
not
but
have
perceived
that
such
things
are
constantly
happening
in
real
life
that
they
are
of
daily
occurrence
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
stand
up
before
you
and
endeavour
to
rebut
a
story
so
plausible
and
so
essentially
convincing
i
feel
that
my
task
is
hopeless
nevertheless
i
must
do
my
best
and
so
on
it
was
one
of
his
greatest
feats
in
the
kind
of
irony
that
appeals
to
a
jury
and
the
audience
deemed
that
the
case
was
already
virtually
decided
after
whitney
witt
and
his
secretary
had
been
called
and
had
filled
the
court
with
the
echoing
twang
of
new
york
the
controlled
fury
of
the
aged
witt
was
highly
effective
henry
leek
was
invited
to
the
she
was
supported
thither
by
her
two
curates
who
however
could
not
prevent
her
from
weeping
at
the
stern
voice
of
the
usher
she
related
her
marriage
is
that
your
husband
demanded
vodrey
who
had
now
assumed
the
principal
pennington
being
engaged
in
another
play
in
another
theatre
pointing
with
one
of
his
dramatic
gestures
to
priam
farll
it
is
sobbed
henry
leek
the
unhappy
creature
believed
what
she
said
and
the
curates
though
silent
made
a
deep
impression
on
the
jury
in
when
crepitude
forced
her
to
admit
that
on
first
meeting
priam
in
his
house
in
werter
road
she
had
not
been
quite
sure
of
his
identity
she
replied
it
all
come
over
me
since
should
a
woman
recognize
the
father
of
her
own
children
she
should
interpolated
the
judge
there
was
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
whether
his
word
was
jocular
or
not
henry
leek
was
a
touching
figure
but
not
amusing
it
was
duncan
farll
who
quite
unintentionally
supplied
the
first
relief
duncan
the
possibility
of
priam
being
priam
he
detailed
all
the
circumstances
that
followed
the
death
in
selwood
terrace
and
showed
in
fifty
ways
that
priam
could
not
have
been
priam
the
man
now
masquerading
as
priam
was
not
even
a
gentleman
whereas
priam
was
duncan
cousin
duncan
was
an
excellent
witness
dry
precise
imperturbable
under
by
crepitude
he
had
to
describe
particularly
his
boyish
meeting
with
priam
crepitude
was
not
inquisitive
tell
us
what
occurred
said
crepitude
well
we
fought
oh
you
fought
what
did
you
two
naughty
boys
fight
about
great
laughter
about
a
i
think
oh
not
a
a
great
laughter
i
think
a
and
what
was
the
result
of
this
sanguinary
encounter
great
laughter
my
cousin
loosened
one
of
my
teeth
great
laughter
in
which
the
court
joined
and
what
did
you
do
to
him
i
afraid
i
did
do
much
i
remember
tearing
half
his
clothes
off
roars
of
laughter
in
which
every
one
joined
except
priam
and
duncan
farll
oh
you
are
sure
you
remember
that
you
are
sure
that
it
was
he
who
tore
clothes
off
lots
of
hysteric
laughter
yes
said
duncan
coldly
dreaming
in
the
past
his
eyes
had
the
away
look
as
he
added
i
remember
now
that
my
cousin
had
two
little
moles
on
his
neck
below
the
collar
i
seem
to
remember
seeing
them
just
thought
of
it
there
is
of
course
when
it
is
mentioned
in
a
theatre
something
exorbitantly
funny
about
even
one
mole
two
moles
together
brought
the
house
down
crepitude
leaned
over
to
a
solicitor
in
front
of
him
the
solicitor
leaned
aside
to
a
solicitor
clerk
and
the
solicitor
clerk
whispered
to
priam
farll
who
nodded
er
crepitude
was
beginning
again
but
he
stopped
and
said
to
duncan
farll
thank
you
you
can
step
down
then
a
witness
named
justini
a
cashier
at
the
hôtel
de
paris
monte
carlo
swore
that
priam
farll
the
renowned
painter
had
spent
four
days
in
the
hôtel
de
paris
one
hot
may
seven
years
ago
and
that
the
person
in
the
court
whom
the
defendant
stated
to
be
priam
farll
was
not
that
man
no
could
shake
justini
following
him
came
the
manager
of
the
hôtel
belvedere
at
mont
pélerin
near
vevey
switzerland
who
related
a
similar
tale
and
was
equally
unshaken
and
after
that
the
pictures
themselves
were
brought
in
and
the
experts
came
after
them
and
technical
evidence
was
begun
scarcely
had
it
begun
when
a
clock
struck
and
the
performance
ended
for
the
day
the
principal
actors
doffed
their
costumes
and
snatched
up
the
evening
papers
to
make
sure
that
the
descriptive
reporters
had
been
as
eulogistic
of
them
as
usual
the
judge
who
subscribed
to
a
agency
was
glad
to
find
the
next
morning
that
none
of
his
jokes
had
been
omitted
by
any
of
the
nineteen
chief
london
dailies
and
the
strand
and
piccadilly
were
quick
with
witt
parfitts
on
evening
posters
and
in
the
strident
mouths
of
newsboys
the
telegraph
wires
vibrated
to
witt
parfitts
in
the
great
betting
industrial
towns
of
the
provinces
wagers
were
laid
at
scientific
prices
england
in
a
word
was
content
and
the
principal
actors
had
the
right
to
be
content
also
very
astute
people
in
clubs
and
saloon
bars
talked
darkly
about
those
two
moles
and
priam
nod
in
response
to
the
whispers
of
the
solicitor
clerk
such
details
do
not
escape
the
modern
sketch
writer
at
a
thousand
a
year
to
very
astute
people
the
two
moles
appeared
to
promise
pretty
things
leek
in
the
box
this
legend
got
itself
on
to
the
telegraph
wires
and
the
placards
within
a
few
minutes
of
priam
taking
the
oath
it
sent
a
shiver
of
anticipation
throughout
the
country
three
days
had
passed
since
the
opening
of
the
case
for
actors
engaged
at
a
hundred
a
day
for
the
run
of
the
piece
do
not
crack
whips
behind
experts
engaged
at
ten
or
twenty
a
day
the
pace
had
therefore
been
dignified
and
england
wanted
a
fillip
nobody
except
alice
knew
what
to
expect
from
priam
alice
knew
she
knew
that
priam
was
in
an
extremely
peculiar
state
which
might
lead
to
extremely
peculiar
results
and
she
knew
also
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
with
him
she
herself
had
made
one
little
effort
to
bathe
him
in
the
light
of
reason
the
effort
had
not
succeeded
she
saw
the
danger
of
renewing
it
pennington
by
the
way
insisted
that
she
should
leave
the
court
during
priam
evidence
priam
attitude
towards
the
whole
case
was
one
of
bitter
resentment
a
resentment
now
hot
now
cold
he
had
the
strongest
possible
objection
to
the
entire
affair
he
hated
witt
as
keenly
as
he
hated
oxford
all
that
he
demanded
from
the
world
was
peace
and
quietness
and
the
world
would
not
grant
him
these
inexpensive
commodities
he
had
not
asked
to
be
buried
in
westminster
abbey
his
interment
had
been
forced
upon
him
and
if
he
chose
to
call
himself
by
another
name
why
should
he
not
do
so
if
he
chose
to
marry
a
simple
woman
and
live
in
a
suburb
and
paint
pictures
at
ten
pounds
each
why
should
he
not
do
so
why
should
he
be
dragged
out
of
his
tranquillity
because
two
persons
in
whom
he
felt
no
interest
whatever
had
quarrelled
over
his
pictures
why
should
his
life
have
been
made
unbearable
in
putney
by
the
extravagant
curiosity
of
a
mob
of
journalists
and
then
why
should
he
be
compelled
by
means
of
a
piece
of
blue
paper
to
go
through
the
frightful
ordeal
and
flame
of
publicity
in
a
that
was
the
crowning
unmerited
torture
the
unthinkable
horror
which
had
broken
his
sleep
for
many
nights
in
the
box
he
certainly
had
all
the
appearance
of
a
trapped
criminal
with
his
nervous
movements
his
restless
lowered
eyes
and
his
faint
hard
voice
that
he
could
scarcely
fetch
up
from
his
throat
nervousness
lined
with
resentment
forms
excellent
material
for
the
plastic
art
of
a
counsel
and
pennington
itched
to
be
at
work
crepitude
oxford
counsel
was
in
less
joyous
mood
priam
was
crepitude
own
witness
and
yet
a
horrible
witness
a
witness
who
had
consistently
and
ferociously
declined
to
open
his
mouth
until
he
was
in
the
box
assuredly
he
had
nodded
in
response
to
the
whispered
question
of
the
solicitor
clerk
but
he
had
not
confirmed
the
nod
nor
breathed
a
word
of
assistance
during
the
three
days
of
the
trial
he
had
merely
sat
there
blazing
in
silence
your
name
is
priam
farll
began
crepitude
it
is
said
priam
sullenly
and
with
all
the
external
characteristics
of
a
liar
at
intervals
he
glanced
surreptitiously
at
the
judge
as
though
the
judge
had
been
a
bomb
with
a
lighted
fuse
the
examination
started
badly
and
it
went
from
worse
to
worse
the
idea
that
this
craven
prevaricating
figure
in
the
box
could
be
the
illustrious
the
priam
farll
seemed
absurd
crepitude
had
to
exercise
all
his
in
order
not
to
bully
priam
that
is
all
said
crepitude
after
priam
had
given
his
preposterous
and
halting
explanations
of
the
strange
phenomena
of
his
life
after
the
death
of
leek
none
of
these
carried
conviction
he
merely
said
that
the
woman
leek
was
mistaken
in
identifying
him
as
her
husband
he
inferred
that
she
was
hysterical
this
inference
alienated
him
from
the
audience
completely
his
statement
that
he
had
no
definite
reason
for
pretending
to
be
leek
that
it
was
an
impulse
of
the
moment
was
received
with
mute
derision
his
explanation
when
questioned
as
to
the
evidence
of
the
hotel
officials
that
more
than
once
his
valet
leek
had
gone
about
impersonating
his
master
seemed
grotesquely
inadequate
people
wondered
why
crepitude
had
made
no
reference
to
the
moles
the
fact
was
crepitude
was
afraid
to
refer
to
the
moles
in
mentioning
the
moles
to
priam
he
might
be
staking
all
to
lose
all
however
pennington
alluded
to
the
moles
but
not
until
he
had
conclusively
proved
to
the
judge
in
a
of
two
duration
that
priam
knew
nothing
of
priam
own
youth
nor
of
painting
nor
of
the
world
of
painters
he
made
a
sad
mess
of
priam
and
voice
grew
fainter
and
fainter
and
his
gestures
more
and
more
pennington
achieved
one
or
two
brilliant
little
effects
now
you
say
you
went
with
the
defendant
to
his
club
and
that
he
told
you
of
the
difficulty
he
was
in
yes
did
he
make
you
any
offer
of
money
yes
ah
what
did
he
offer
you
thousand
pounds
sensation
in
court
so
and
what
was
this
thousand
pounds
to
be
for
i
do
know
you
do
know
come
now
i
do
know
you
accepted
the
offer
no
i
refused
it
sensation
in
court
why
did
you
refuse
it
because
i
did
care
to
accept
it
then
no
money
passed
between
you
that
day
yes
five
hundred
pounds
what
for
a
picture
the
same
kind
of
picture
that
you
had
been
selling
at
ten
pounds
yes
so
that
on
the
very
day
that
the
defendant
wanted
you
to
swear
that
you
were
priam
farll
the
price
of
your
pictures
rose
from
ten
pounds
to
five
hundred
yes
does
that
strike
you
as
odd
yes
you
still
say
mind
leek
you
are
on
your
oath
you
still
say
that
you
refused
thousand
pounds
in
order
to
accept
five
hundred
i
sold
a
picture
for
five
hundred
on
the
placards
in
the
strand
severe
of
leek
now
about
the
encounter
with
duncan
farll
of
course
if
you
are
really
priam
farll
you
remember
all
about
that
yes
what
age
were
you
i
do
know
about
nine
oh
you
were
about
nine
a
suitable
age
for
cake
great
laughter
now
duncan
farll
says
you
loosened
one
of
his
teeth
i
did
and
that
he
tore
your
clothes
i
dare
say
he
says
he
remembers
the
fact
because
you
had
two
moles
yes
have
you
two
moles
yes
immense
sensation
pennington
paused
where
are
they
on
my
neck
just
below
my
collar
kindly
place
your
hand
at
the
spot
priam
did
so
the
excitement
was
terrific
pennington
again
paused
but
convinced
that
priam
was
an
impostor
he
sarcastically
proceeded
perhaps
if
i
am
not
asking
too
much
you
will
take
your
collar
off
and
show
the
two
moles
to
the
court
no
said
priam
stoutly
and
for
the
first
time
he
looked
pennington
in
the
face
you
would
prefer
to
do
it
perhaps
in
his
lordship
room
if
his
lordship
consents
i
wo
do
it
anywhere
said
priam
but
surely
the
judge
began
i
wo
do
it
anywhere
my
lord
priam
repeated
loudly
all
his
resentment
surged
up
once
more
and
particularly
his
resentment
against
the
little
army
of
experts
who
had
pronounced
his
pictures
to
be
clever
but
worthless
imitations
of
himself
if
his
pictures
admittedly
painted
after
his
supposed
death
could
not
prove
his
identity
if
his
word
was
to
be
flouted
by
insulting
and
bewigged
beasts
of
prey
then
his
moles
should
not
prove
his
identity
he
resolved
upon
obstinacy
the
witness
gentlemen
said
pennington
in
triumph
to
the
jury
has
two
moles
on
his
neck
exactly
as
described
by
duncan
farll
but
he
will
not
display
them
eleven
legal
minds
bent
nobly
to
the
problem
whether
the
law
and
justice
of
england
could
compel
a
free
man
to
take
his
collar
off
if
he
refused
to
take
his
collar
off
in
the
meantime
of
course
the
case
had
to
proceed
the
six
or
seven
hundred
pounds
a
day
must
be
earned
and
there
were
various
other
witnesses
the
next
witness
was
alice
chapter
xii
when
alice
was
called
and
when
she
stood
up
in
the
box
and
smiling
indulgently
at
the
doddering
usher
kissed
the
book
as
if
it
had
been
a
chubby
nephew
a
change
came
over
the
emotional
atmosphere
of
the
court
which
felt
a
natural
need
to
smile
alice
was
in
all
her
best
clothes
but
it
can
not
be
said
that
she
looked
the
wife
of
a
painter
in
answer
to
a
question
she
stated
that
before
marrying
priam
she
was
the
widow
of
a
builder
in
a
small
way
of
business
well
known
in
putney
and
also
in
wandsworth
this
was
obviously
true
she
could
have
been
nothing
but
the
widow
of
a
builder
in
a
small
way
of
business
well
known
in
putney
and
also
in
wandsworth
she
was
every
inch
that
how
did
you
first
meet
your
present
husband
mrs
leek
asked
crepitude
farll
if
you
please
she
cheerfully
corrected
him
well
farll
then
i
must
say
she
remarked
conversationally
it
seems
queer
you
should
be
calling
me
leek
when
they
paying
you
to
prove
that
i
farll
excuse
me
i
forget
your
name
this
nettled
crepitude
it
nettled
him
too
merely
to
see
a
witness
standing
in
the
box
just
as
if
she
were
standing
in
her
kitchen
talking
to
a
tradesman
at
the
door
he
was
not
accustomed
to
such
a
spectacle
and
though
alice
was
his
own
witness
he
was
angry
with
her
because
he
was
angry
with
her
husband
he
blushed
juniors
behind
him
could
watch
the
blush
creeping
like
a
tide
round
the
back
of
his
neck
over
his
exceedingly
white
collar
if
you
be
good
enough
to
reply
said
he
i
met
my
husband
outside
george
hall
by
appointment
said
she
but
before
that
how
did
you
make
his
acquaintance
through
a
matrimonial
agency
said
she
oh
observed
crepitude
and
decided
that
he
would
not
pursue
that
avenue
the
fact
was
alice
had
put
him
into
the
wrong
humour
for
making
the
best
of
her
she
was
moreover
in
a
very
difficult
position
for
priam
had
positively
forbidden
her
to
have
any
speech
with
clerks
or
with
solicitors
and
thus
crepitude
knew
not
what
pitfalls
for
him
her
evidence
might
contain
he
drew
from
her
an
expression
of
opinion
that
her
husband
was
the
real
priam
farll
but
she
could
give
no
reasons
in
support
did
not
seem
to
conceive
that
reasons
in
support
were
necessary
has
your
husband
any
moles
asked
crepitude
suddenly
any
what
demanded
alice
leaning
forward
vodrey
sprang
up
i
submit
to
your
lordship
that
my
learned
friend
is
putting
a
leading
question
said
vodrey
crepitude
said
the
judge
can
you
not
phrase
your
questions
differently
has
your
husband
any
birthmarks
er
on
his
body
crepitude
tried
again
oh
you
said
you
need
be
afraid
yes
he
got
two
moles
close
together
on
his
neck
here
and
she
pointed
amid
silence
to
the
exact
spot
then
noticing
the
silence
she
added
that
all
that
i
of
crepitude
resolved
to
end
his
examination
upon
this
impressive
note
and
he
sat
down
and
alice
had
vodrey
to
face
you
met
your
husband
through
a
matrimonial
agency
he
asked
yes
who
first
had
recourse
to
the
agency
i
did
and
what
was
your
object
i
wanted
to
find
a
husband
of
course
she
smiled
what
people
go
to
matrimonial
agencies
for
you
are
here
to
put
questions
to
me
said
vodrey
severely
well
she
said
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
known
what
people
went
to
matrimonial
agencies
for
still
you
live
and
learn
she
sighed
cheerfully
do
you
think
a
matrimonial
agency
is
quite
the
nicest
way
of
it
depends
what
you
mean
by
said
alice
womanly
yes
said
alice
shortly
i
do
if
you
going
to
stand
there
and
tell
me
i
unwomanly
all
i
have
to
say
is
that
you
unmanly
you
say
you
first
met
your
husband
outside
st
george
hall
yes
never
seen
him
before
no
how
did
you
recognize
him
by
his
photograph
oh
he
sent
you
his
photograph
yes
with
a
letter
yes
in
what
name
was
the
letter
signed
henry
leek
was
that
before
or
after
the
death
of
the
man
who
was
buried
in
westminster
abbey
a
day
or
two
before
sensation
in
court
so
that
your
present
husband
was
calling
himself
henry
leek
before
the
death
no
he
was
that
letter
was
written
by
the
man
that
died
my
husband
found
my
reply
to
it
and
my
photograph
in
the
man
bag
afterwards
and
happening
to
be
strolling
past
george
hall
just
at
the
moment
like
well
happening
to
be
strolling
past
george
hall
just
at
the
moment
like
titters
i
caught
sight
of
him
and
spoke
to
him
you
see
i
thought
then
that
he
was
the
man
who
wrote
the
letter
what
made
you
think
so
i
had
the
photograph
so
that
the
man
who
wrote
the
letter
and
died
did
send
his
own
photograph
he
sent
another
photograph
the
photograph
of
your
husband
yes
did
you
know
that
i
should
have
thought
you
have
known
that
do
you
really
expect
the
jury
to
believe
that
tale
alice
turned
smiling
to
the
jury
no
she
said
i
not
sure
as
i
do
i
did
believe
it
myself
for
a
long
time
but
it
true
then
at
first
you
did
believe
your
husband
was
the
real
priam
farll
no
you
see
he
did
exactly
tell
me
like
he
only
sort
of
hinted
but
you
did
believe
no
you
thought
he
was
lying
no
i
thought
it
was
just
a
kind
of
an
idea
he
had
you
know
my
husband
is
like
other
gentlemen
i
imagine
not
said
vodrey
now
when
did
you
come
to
be
perfectly
sure
that
your
husband
was
the
real
priam
farll
it
was
the
night
of
that
day
when
oxford
came
down
to
see
him
he
told
me
all
about
it
then
oh
that
day
when
oxford
paid
him
five
hundred
pounds
yes
immediately
oxford
paid
him
five
hundred
pounds
you
were
ready
to
believe
that
your
husband
was
the
real
priam
farll
does
that
strike
you
as
excessively
curious
it
just
how
it
happened
said
alice
blandly
now
about
these
moles
you
pointed
to
the
right
side
of
your
neck
are
you
sure
they
are
on
the
left
side
let
me
think
now
said
alice
frowning
when
he
shaving
in
a
morning
he
get
up
earlier
now
than
he
used
to
i
can
see
his
face
in
the
and
in
the
the
moles
are
on
the
left
side
so
on
they
must
be
on
the
right
side
yes
the
right
side
that
it
have
you
never
seen
them
except
in
a
mirror
my
good
woman
interpolated
the
judge
for
some
reason
alice
flushed
i
suppose
you
think
that
funny
she
snapped
slightly
tossing
her
head
the
audience
expected
the
roof
to
fall
but
the
roof
withstood
the
strain
thanks
to
a
sagacious
deafness
on
the
part
of
the
judge
if
indeed
he
had
not
been
visited
by
a
sudden
deafness
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
he
would
have
handled
the
situation
have
you
any
idea
vodrey
inquired
why
your
husband
refuses
to
submit
his
neck
to
the
inspection
of
the
court
i
did
know
he
had
refused
but
he
has
well
said
alice
if
you
had
turned
me
out
of
the
court
while
he
was
being
examined
perhaps
i
could
have
told
you
but
i
ca
as
it
is
so
it
serves
you
right
thus
ended
alice
performances
public
the
court
rose
and
another
six
or
seven
hundred
pounds
was
gone
into
the
pockets
of
the
celebrated
artistes
engaged
it
became
at
once
obvious
from
the
tone
of
the
evening
placards
and
the
contents
of
evening
papers
and
the
remarks
in
crowded
suburban
trains
that
for
the
public
the
trial
had
resolved
itself
into
an
affair
of
moles
nothing
else
now
interested
the
great
and
intelligent
public
if
priam
had
those
moles
on
his
neck
then
he
was
the
real
priam
if
he
had
not
then
he
was
a
common
cheat
the
public
had
taken
the
matter
into
its
own
hands
the
sturdy
common
sense
of
the
public
was
being
applied
to
the
affair
on
the
whole
it
may
be
said
that
the
sturdy
common
sense
of
the
public
was
against
priam
for
the
majority
the
entire
story
was
fishily
preposterous
it
must
surely
be
clear
to
the
feeblest
brain
that
if
priam
possessed
moles
he
would
expose
them
the
minority
who
talked
of
psychology
and
the
artistic
temperament
were
regarded
as
the
cousins
of
little
englanders
and
the
direct
descendants
of
still
the
thing
ought
to
be
proved
or
disproved
why
did
the
judge
commit
him
for
contempt
of
court
he
would
then
be
sent
to
holloway
and
be
compelled
to
strip
and
there
you
were
or
why
did
oxford
hire
some
one
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
him
in
the
street
and
carry
the
quarrel
to
blows
with
a
view
to
a
nice
thing
english
justice
if
it
had
no
machinery
to
force
a
man
to
show
his
neck
to
a
jury
but
then
english
justice
notoriously
comic
and
whole
trainfuls
of
people
sneered
at
their
country
institution
in
a
manner
which
had
it
been
adopted
by
a
foreigner
would
have
plunged
europe
into
war
and
finally
tested
the
theory
undoubtedly
the
immemorial
traditions
of
english
justice
came
in
for
very
severe
handling
simply
because
priam
would
not
take
his
collar
off
and
he
would
not
the
next
morning
there
were
consultations
in
counsel
rooms
and
the
common
law
of
the
realm
was
ransacked
to
find
a
legal
method
of
inspecting
priam
moles
without
success
priam
arrived
safely
at
the
courts
with
his
usual
high
collar
and
was
photographed
thirty
times
between
the
kerb
and
the
entrance
hall
he
slept
in
it
cried
wags
bet
yer
two
ter
one
it
a
clean
cried
other
wags
his
missus
gets
his
linen
up
it
was
subject
to
such
indignities
that
the
man
who
had
defied
the
supreme
court
of
judicature
reached
his
seat
in
the
theatre
when
solicitors
and
counsel
attempted
to
reason
with
him
he
answered
with
silence
the
rumour
ran
that
in
his
hip
pocket
he
was
carrying
a
revolver
wherewith
to
protect
the
modesty
of
his
neck
the
celebrated
artistes
having
perceived
the
folly
of
losing
six
or
seven
hundred
pounds
a
day
because
priam
happened
to
be
an
obstinate
idiot
continued
with
the
case
for
oxford
and
another
army
of
experts
of
european
reputation
were
waiting
to
prove
that
the
pictures
admittedly
painted
after
the
burial
in
the
national
valhalla
were
painted
by
priam
farll
and
could
have
been
painted
by
no
other
they
demonstrated
this
by
internal
evidence
in
other
words
they
proved
by
deductions
from
squares
of
canvas
that
priam
had
moles
on
his
neck
it
was
a
phenomenon
eminently
legal
and
priam
in
his
stiff
collar
sat
and
listened
the
experts
however
achieved
two
feats
both
unintentionally
they
sent
the
judge
soundly
to
sleep
and
they
wearied
the
public
which
considered
that
the
trial
was
falling
short
of
its
early
promise
this
went
on
to
the
extent
of
two
whole
days
and
appreciably
more
than
another
thousand
pounds
and
on
the
third
day
priam
somewhat
hardened
to
renown
reappeared
with
his
mysterious
neck
and
more
determined
than
ever
he
had
seen
in
a
paper
which
was
otherwise
chiefly
occupied
with
moles
and
experts
a
cautious
statement
that
the
police
had
collected
the
necessary
evidence
of
bigamy
and
that
his
arrest
was
imminent
however
something
stranger
than
arrest
for
bigamy
happened
to
him
the
principal
king
bench
corridor
in
the
law
courts
like
the
other
main
corridors
is
a
place
of
strange
meetings
and
interviews
a
man
may
receive
there
a
bit
of
news
that
will
change
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
his
life
or
he
may
receive
only
an
invitation
to
a
mediocre
lunch
in
the
restaurant
underneath
he
never
knows
beforehand
priam
assuredly
did
not
receive
an
invitation
to
lunch
he
was
traversing
the
crowded
thoroughfares
for
with
the
exception
of
match
and
toothpick
sellers
the
corridor
has
the
characteristics
of
a
strand
pavement
in
the
forenoon
when
he
caught
sight
of
oxford
talking
to
a
woman
now
he
had
exchanged
no
word
with
oxford
since
the
historic
scene
in
the
club
and
he
was
determined
to
exchange
no
word
however
they
had
not
gone
through
the
formality
of
an
open
breach
the
most
prudent
thing
to
do
therefore
was
to
turn
and
take
another
corridor
and
priam
would
have
fled
being
capable
of
astonishing
prudence
when
prudence
meant
the
avoidance
of
unpleasant
encounters
but
just
as
he
was
turning
the
woman
in
conversation
with
oxford
saw
him
and
stepped
towards
him
with
the
rapidity
of
thought
holding
forth
her
hand
she
was
tall
thin
and
stiffly
distinguished
in
the
brusque
motions
of
her
limbs
her
coat
and
skirt
were
quite
presentable
but
her
feet
were
large
not
her
fault
of
course
though
one
is
apt
to
treat
large
feet
as
a
crime
and
her
feathered
hat
was
even
larger
she
hid
her
age
behind
a
veil
how
do
you
do
mr
farll
she
addressed
him
firmly
in
a
voice
which
nevertheless
throbbed
it
was
lady
sophia
entwistle
how
do
you
do
he
said
taking
her
offered
hand
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
and
nothing
else
to
say
then
oxford
put
out
his
hand
how
do
you
do
mr
farll
and
taking
oxford
hated
hand
priam
said
again
how
do
you
do
it
was
all
just
as
if
there
had
been
no
past
the
past
seemed
to
have
been
swallowed
up
in
the
ordinariness
of
the
crowded
corridor
by
all
the
rules
for
the
guidance
of
human
conduct
lady
sophia
ought
to
have
denounced
priam
with
outstretched
dramatic
finger
to
the
contempt
of
the
world
as
a
philanderer
with
the
hearts
of
trusting
women
and
he
ought
to
have
kicked
oxford
along
the
corridor
for
a
scheming
hebrew
but
they
merely
shook
hands
and
asked
each
other
how
they
did
not
even
expecting
an
answer
this
shows
to
what
extent
the
ancient
qualities
of
the
race
have
deteriorated
then
a
silence
i
suppose
you
know
farll
said
lady
sophia
rather
suddenly
that
i
have
got
to
give
evidence
in
this
case
no
he
said
i
did
yes
it
seems
they
have
scoured
all
over
the
continent
in
vain
to
find
people
who
knew
you
under
your
proper
name
and
who
could
identify
you
with
certainty
and
they
could
find
one
doubtless
owing
to
your
peculiar
habits
of
travel
really
said
priam
he
had
made
love
to
this
woman
he
had
kissed
her
they
had
promised
to
marry
each
other
it
was
a
piece
of
wild
folly
on
his
part
but
in
the
eyes
of
an
impartial
person
folly
could
not
excuse
his
desertion
of
her
his
flight
from
her
intellectual
charms
his
gaze
pierced
her
veil
no
she
was
not
quite
so
old
as
alice
she
was
not
more
plain
than
alice
she
certainly
knew
more
than
alice
she
could
talk
about
pictures
without
sticking
a
knife
into
his
soul
and
turning
it
in
the
wound
she
was
better
dressed
than
alice
and
her
behaviour
on
the
present
occasion
candid
kind
correct
could
not
have
been
surpassed
by
alice
and
yet
her
demeanour
was
without
question
prodigiously
splendid
in
its
ignoring
of
all
that
she
had
gone
through
and
yet
even
in
that
moment
of
complicated
misery
he
had
enough
strength
to
hate
her
because
he
had
been
fool
enough
to
make
love
to
her
no
excuse
whatever
for
him
of
course
i
was
in
india
when
i
first
heard
of
this
case
lady
sophia
continued
at
first
i
thought
it
must
be
a
sort
of
tichborne
business
over
again
then
knowing
you
as
i
did
i
thought
perhaps
it
was
and
as
lady
sophia
happens
to
be
in
london
now
put
in
oxford
she
is
good
enough
to
give
her
invaluable
evidence
on
my
behalf
that
is
scarcely
the
way
to
describe
it
said
lady
sophia
coldly
i
am
only
here
because
you
compel
me
to
be
here
by
subpoena
it
is
all
due
to
your
acquaintanceship
with
my
aunt
quite
so
quite
so
oxford
agreed
it
naturally
ca
be
very
agreeable
to
you
to
have
to
go
into
the
and
submit
to
certainly
not
and
i
am
the
more
obliged
to
you
for
your
kindness
lady
sophia
priam
comprehended
the
situation
lady
sophia
after
his
supposed
death
had
imparted
to
relatives
the
fact
of
his
engagement
and
the
unscrupulous
scoundrel
oxford
had
got
hold
of
her
and
was
forcing
her
to
give
evidence
for
him
and
after
the
evidence
the
joke
of
every
man
in
the
street
would
be
to
the
effect
that
priam
farll
rather
than
marry
the
skinny
spinster
had
pretended
to
be
dead
you
see
oxford
added
to
him
the
important
point
about
lady
sophia
evidence
is
that
in
paris
she
saw
both
you
and
your
valet
the
valet
obviously
a
servant
and
you
obviously
his
master
there
can
therefore
be
no
question
of
her
having
been
deceived
by
the
valet
posing
as
the
master
it
is
a
most
fortunate
thing
that
by
a
mere
accident
i
got
on
the
tracks
of
lady
sophia
in
time
in
the
nick
of
time
only
yesterday
afternoon
no
reference
by
oxford
to
priam
obstinacy
in
the
matter
of
collars
he
appeared
to
regard
priam
collar
as
a
phenomenon
of
nature
such
as
the
weather
or
a
rock
in
the
sea
as
something
to
be
accepted
with
resignation
no
sign
of
annoyance
with
priam
he
was
the
prince
of
diplomatists
was
oxford
can
i
speak
to
you
a
minute
said
lady
sophia
to
priam
oxford
stepped
away
with
a
bow
and
lady
sophia
looked
steadily
at
priam
he
had
to
admit
again
that
she
was
stupendous
she
was
his
capital
mistake
but
she
was
stupendous
at
their
last
interview
he
had
embraced
her
she
had
attended
his
funeral
in
westminster
abbey
and
she
could
suppress
all
that
from
her
eyes
she
could
stand
there
calm
and
urbane
in
her
acceptance
of
the
terrific
past
apparently
she
forgave
said
lady
sophia
simply
now
farll
shall
i
have
to
give
evidence
or
not
you
know
it
depends
on
you
the
casualness
of
her
tone
was
sublime
it
was
heroic
it
made
her
feet
small
he
had
sworn
to
himself
that
he
would
be
cut
in
pieces
before
he
would
aid
the
unscrupulous
oxford
by
removing
his
collar
in
presence
of
those
dramatic
artistes
he
had
been
grossly
insulted
disturbed
maltreated
and
exploited
the
entire
world
had
meddled
with
his
private
business
and
he
would
be
cut
in
pieces
before
he
would
display
those
moles
which
would
decide
the
issue
in
an
instant
well
she
had
cut
him
in
pieces
please
do
worry
said
he
in
reply
i
will
attend
to
things
at
that
moment
alice
who
had
followed
him
by
a
later
train
appeared
lady
sophia
he
said
raising
his
hat
and
left
her
on
farll
takes
his
collar
off
witt
parfitts
result
these
and
similar
placards
flew
in
the
strand
breezes
never
in
the
history
of
empires
had
the
removal
of
a
starched
linen
collar
size
created
part
of
the
sensation
caused
by
the
removal
of
this
collar
it
was
an
act
it
finished
the
drama
of
witt
parfitts
the
renowned
artistes
engaged
did
not
of
course
permit
the
case
to
collapse
at
once
no
it
had
to
be
concluded
slowly
and
majestically
with
due
forms
and
expenses
new
witnesses
such
as
doctors
had
to
be
called
and
old
ones
recalled
duncan
farll
for
instance
had
to
be
recalled
and
if
the
situation
was
ignominious
for
priam
it
was
also
ignominious
for
duncan
duncan
sole
advantage
in
his
defeat
was
that
the
judge
did
not
skin
him
alive
in
the
summing
up
nor
the
jury
in
their
verdict
england
breathed
more
freely
when
the
affair
was
finally
over
and
the
renowned
artistes
engaged
had
withdrawn
enveloped
in
glory
the
truth
was
that
england
so
proud
of
her
systems
had
had
a
fright
her
judicial
methods
had
very
nearly
failed
to
make
a
man
take
his
collar
off
in
public
they
had
really
failed
but
it
had
all
come
right
in
the
end
and
so
england
pretended
that
they
had
only
just
missed
failing
a
grave
injustice
would
have
been
perpetrated
had
priam
chosen
not
to
take
off
his
collar
people
said
naturally
that
imprisonment
for
bigamy
would
have
included
the
of
collars
but
then
it
was
rumoured
that
prosecution
for
bigamy
had
not
by
any
means
been
a
certainty
as
since
leaving
the
box
henry
leek
had
wavered
in
her
identification
however
the
justice
of
england
had
emerged
safely
and
it
was
all
very
astounding
and
shocking
and
improper
and
everybody
was
exceedingly
wise
after
the
event
and
with
one
voice
the
press
cried
that
something
painful
ought
to
occur
at
once
to
priam
farll
no
matter
how
great
an
artist
he
was
the
question
was
how
could
priam
be
trapped
in
the
net
of
the
law
he
had
not
committed
bigamy
he
had
done
nothing
he
had
only
behaved
in
a
negative
manner
he
had
not
even
given
false
information
to
the
registrar
and
cashmore
could
throw
no
light
on
the
episode
for
he
was
dead
his
wife
and
daughters
had
at
last
succeeded
in
killing
him
the
judge
had
intimated
that
the
ecclesiastical
wrath
of
the
dean
and
chapter
might
speedily
and
terribly
overtake
priam
farll
but
that
sounded
vague
and
unsatisfactory
to
the
lay
ear
in
short
the
matter
was
the
most
curious
that
ever
was
and
for
the
sake
of
the
national
peace
of
mind
the
national
dignity
and
the
national
conceit
it
was
allowed
to
drop
into
forgetfulness
after
a
few
days
and
when
the
papers
announced
that
by
priam
wish
the
farll
museum
was
to
be
carried
to
completion
and
formally
conveyed
to
the
nation
despite
all
the
nation
decided
to
accept
that
honourable
amend
and
went
off
to
the
seaside
for
its
annual
holiday
will
to
alice
insisted
on
it
and
so
immediately
before
their
final
departure
from
england
they
went
priam
pretended
that
the
visit
was
undertaken
solely
to
please
her
but
the
fact
is
that
his
own
morbid
curiosity
moved
in
the
same
direction
they
travelled
by
an
omnibus
past
the
putney
empire
and
the
walham
green
empire
as
far
as
walham
green
and
there
changed
into
another
one
which
carried
them
past
the
chelsea
empire
the
army
and
navy
stores
and
the
hotel
windsor
to
the
doors
of
westminster
abbey
and
they
vanished
out
of
the
october
sunshine
into
the
gloom
of
valhalla
it
was
alice
first
view
of
valhalla
though
of
course
she
had
heard
of
it
in
old
times
she
had
visited
madame
tussaud
and
the
tower
but
she
had
not
had
leisure
to
get
round
as
far
as
valhalla
it
impressed
her
deeply
a
verger
pointed
them
to
the
nave
but
they
dared
not
demand
more
minute
instructions
they
had
not
the
courage
to
ask
for
priam
could
not
speak
there
were
moments
with
him
when
he
could
not
speak
lest
his
soul
should
come
out
of
his
mouth
and
flit
irrecoverably
away
and
he
could
not
find
the
tomb
save
for
the
outrageous
tomb
of
mighty
newton
the
nave
seemed
to
be
as
naked
as
when
it
came
into
the
world
yet
he
was
sure
he
was
buried
in
the
nave
and
only
three
years
ago
too
astounding
was
it
not
what
could
happen
in
three
years
he
knew
that
the
tomb
had
not
been
removed
for
there
had
been
an
article
in
the
on
the
previous
day
asking
in
the
name
of
a
scandalized
public
whether
the
dean
and
chapter
did
not
consider
that
three
months
was
more
than
long
enough
for
the
correction
of
a
fundamental
error
in
the
burial
department
he
was
gloomy
he
had
in
truth
been
somewhat
gloomy
ever
since
the
trial
perhaps
it
was
the
shadow
of
the
wrath
of
the
dean
and
chapter
on
him
he
had
ceased
to
procure
joy
in
the
daily
manifestations
of
life
in
the
streets
of
the
town
and
this
failure
to
discover
the
tomb
intensified
the
calm
amiable
sadness
which
distinguished
him
alice
gazing
around
chiefly
with
her
mouth
inquired
suddenly
what
that
printing
there
she
had
detected
a
legend
incised
on
one
of
the
small
stone
flags
which
form
the
vast
floor
of
the
nave
they
stooped
over
it
priam
farll
it
said
simply
in
fine
roman
letters
and
then
his
dates
that
was
all
near
by
on
other
flags
they
deciphered
other
names
of
honour
this
austere
method
of
marking
the
repose
of
the
dead
commended
itself
to
him
caused
him
to
feel
proud
of
himself
and
of
the
ridiculous
england
that
somehow
keeps
our
great
love
his
gloom
faded
and
do
you
know
what
idea
rushed
from
his
heart
to
his
brain
by
jove
i
will
paint
finer
pictures
than
any
i
done
yet
and
the
impulse
to
recommence
the
work
of
creation
surged
over
him
the
tears
started
to
his
eyes
i
like
that
murmured
alice
gazing
at
the
stone
i
do
think
nice
and
said
because
he
truly
felt
it
because
the
will
to
live
raged
through
him
again
tingling
and
smarting
i
glad
i
not
there
they
smiled
at
each
other
and
their
instinctive
hands
fumblingly
met
a
few
days
later
the
dean
and
chapter
stung
into
action
by
the
majestic
rebuke
of
the
amended
the
floor
of
valhalla
and
caused
the
mortal
residuum
of
the
immortal
organism
known
as
henry
leek
to
be
nocturnally
transported
to
a
different
bed
a
few
days
later
also
a
north
german
lloyd
steamer
quitted
southampton
for
algiers
bearing
among
its
passengers
priam
and
alice
it
was
a
rough
starlit
night
and
from
the
stern
of
the
vessel
the
tumbled
white
water
made
a
pathway
straight
to
receding
england
priam
had
come
to
love
the
slopes
of
putney
with
the
broad
river
at
the
foot
but
he
showed
what
i
think
was
a
nice
feeling
in
leaving
england
his
sojourn
in
our
land
had
not
crowned
him
with
brilliance
he
was
not
a
being
created
for
society
nor
for
cutting
a
figure
nor
for
exhibiting
tact
and
prudence
in
the
crises
of
existence
he
could
neither
talk
well
nor
read
well
nor
express
himself
in
exactly
suitable
actions
he
could
only
express
himself
at
the
end
of
a
brush
he
could
only
paint
extremely
beautiful
pictures
that
was
the
major
part
of
his
vitality
in
minor
ways
he
may
have
been
upon
occasions
a
fool
but
he
was
never
a
fool
on
canvas
he
said
everything
there
and
said
it
to
perfection
for
those
who
could
read
for
those
who
can
read
and
for
those
who
will
be
able
to
read
five
hundred
years
hence
why
expect
more
from
him
why
be
disappointed
in
him
one
does
not
expect
a
to
play
fine
billiards
you
yourself
mirror
of
prudence
that
you
are
would
have
certainly
avoided
all
priam
manifold
errors
in
the
conduct
of
his
social
career
but
you
see
he
was
divine
in
another
way
as
the
steamer
sped
along
the
lengthening
pathway
from
england
one
question
kept
hopping
in
and
out
of
his
mind
wonder
what
they
do
with
me
next
do
not
imagine
that
he
and
alice
were
staring
over
the
stern
at
the
singular
isle
no
there
were
imperative
reasons
which
affected
both
of
them
against
that
it
was
only
in
the
moments
of
the
comparative
calm
which
always
follows
insurrections
that
priam
had
leisure
to
wonder
and
to
see
his
own
limitations
and
joyfully
to
meditate
upon
the
prospect
of
age
devoted
to
the
sole
doing
of
that
which
he
could
so
supremely
in
a
sweet
exile
with
the
enchantress
alice
