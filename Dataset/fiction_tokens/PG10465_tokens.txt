the
outdoor
girls

chapter
i
a
fluttering
paper
four
girls
were
walking
down
an
street
four
girls
walking
two
by
two
their
arms
their
voices
mingling
in
rapid
talk
punctuated
with
rippling
laughter
and
now
and
then
as
their
happy
spirits
fairly
bubbled
and
overflowed
breaking
into
a
few
waltz
steps
to
the
melody
of
a
dreamy
song
hummed
by
one
of
their
number
the
sun
shining
through
the
trees
cast
patches
of
golden
light
on
the
stone
sidewalk
and
as
the
girls
passed
from
sunshine
to
shadow
they
made
a
bright
and
sometimes
a
dimmer
picture
on
the
street
whereon
were
other
groups
of
maidens
for
school
was
out
betty
nelson
the
idea
is
perfectly
splendid
exclaimed
the
tallest
of
the
quartette
a
stately
fair
girl
with
wonderful
braids
of
hair
on
which
the
sunshine
seemed
to
like
to
linger
and
it
will
be
such
a
relief
from
the
ordinary
way
of
doing
things
added
the
companion
of
the
one
who
thus
paid
a
compliment
to
her
chum
just
in
advance
of
her
i
detest
monotony
if
only
too
many
things
do
happen
to
us
this
somewhat
timid
observation
came
from
the
quietest
of
the
four
she
who
was
walking
with
the
one
addressed
as
betty
why
amy
stonington
cried
the
girl
who
had
first
spoken
as
she
tossed
her
head
to
get
a
rebellious
lock
of
hair
out
of
her
dark
eyes
the
very
idea
we
things
to
happen
do
we
betty
and
she
caught
the
arm
of
one
who
seemed
to
be
the
leader
and
whirled
her
about
to
look
into
her
face
answer
me
she
commanded
do
we
betty
smiled
slightly
revealing
her
white
even
teeth
then
she
said
laughingly
and
the
laugh
seemed
to
illuminate
her
countenance
i
guess
grace
meant
certain
kinds
of
happenings
did
you
grace
of
course
and
the
rather
willowy
creature
whose
style
of
dress
artistically
accentuated
her
figure
caught
a
pencil
that
was
slipping
from
a
book
and
thrust
it
into
the
mass
of
light
hair
that
was
like
a
crown
to
her
beauty
oh
that
all
right
then
and
amy
who
had
interposed
the
objection
looked
relieved
she
was
a
rather
quiet
girl
of
the
character
called
sweet
by
her
intimates
and
truly
she
had
the
disposition
that
merited
the
word
when
can
we
start
asked
grace
ford
then
before
an
answer
could
be
given
she
added
do
let
go
so
fast
we
are
out
to
make
a
walking
record
let
stop
here
in
the
shade
a
moment
the
four
came
to
a
halt
beneath
a
great
horsechestnut
tree
that
gave
welcome
relief
from
the
sun
which
though
it
was
only
may
still
had
much
of
the
advance
hint
of
summer
in
it
there
was
a
carriage
block
near
the
curb
and
grace
draped
herself
artistically
about
it
as
mollie
billette
expressed
it
if
you
tired
now
what
will
you
be
if
we
walk
five
or
six
miles
a
day
asked
betty
with
a
smile
or
even
more
perhaps
oh
i
can
if
i
have
to
but
i
do
have
to
now
come
betty
tell
us
when
we
are
to
start
why
we
ca
decide
now
are
you
so
anxious
all
of
a
sudden
and
betty
pulled
down
and
straightened
the
blue
middy
blouse
that
had
been
rumpled
by
her
energetic
chums
of
course
i
detest
waiting
for
trains
or
anything
else
i
just
dying
to
go
and
i
got
the
cutest
little
traveling
case
it
has
a
special
compartment
for
chocolates
has
it
grace
asked
mollie
billette
whose
dark
and
flashing
eyes
and
black
hair
with
just
a
shade
of
in
it
betrayed
the
french
blood
in
her
veins
oh
grace
could
get
along
without
candy
declared
betty
with
a
smile
now
that
mean
exclaimed
grace
whose
tall
and
slender
figure
and
face
of
peculiar
winsome
beauty
had
gained
her
the
not
overdrawn
characterization
of
gibson
girl
i
do
see
why
billy
wants
to
always
be
saying
such
horrid
things
about
me
i
did
say
anything
mean
snapped
mollie
whose
pseudonym
was
more
often
billy
than
anything
else
and
i
do
want
you
to
say
that
i
do
her
eyes
flashed
and
gave
a
hint
of
the
hidden
fire
of
temper
which
was
not
always
controlled
the
other
girls
looked
at
her
a
bit
apprehensively
if
you
do
like
the
things
i
say
she
went
on
there
are
those
who
do
and
what
more
billy
spoke
betty
softly
i
sure
grace
did
mean
oh
i
know
it
exclaimed
mollie
contritely
it
was
horrid
of
me
to
flare
up
that
way
but
sometimes
i
ca
seem
to
help
it
i
beg
your
pardon
grace
eat
as
many
chocolates
as
you
like
i
help
you
that
generous
she
clasped
her
arms
about
the
and
held
her
cheek
close
to
the
other
blushing
one
do
mind
me
she
cried
impulsively
mollie
was
often
this
way
in
a
little
whirlwind
of
temper
one
moment
and
sweetly
sorry
for
it
the
next
albeit
her
little
spasms
of
rage
were
never
serious
and
seldom
lasted
long
forgiven
murmured
grace
but
i
am
really
anxious
to
know
when
we
can
start
our
camping
and
tramping
club
i
think
the
idea
is
perfectly
splendid
how
did
you
come
to
think
of
it
betty
i
got
the
idea
from
a
book
it
is
original
by
any
means
but
then
i
always
have
been
fond
of
walking
out
in
the
country
especially
only
it
is
so
much
fun
going
alone
so
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
girls
would
like
to
join
we
can
take
a
nice
long
tramp
the
first
opportunity
we
get
just
us
four
asked
grace
no
not
necessarily
we
can
have
as
many
members
as
we
like
i
think
four
is
a
nice
number
spoke
amy
she
was
rather
shy
and
not
given
to
making
new
friends
we
four
no
more
declaimed
mollie
suppose
we
do
limit
it
to
four
betty
well
we
can
talk
of
that
later
and
i
do
so
want
to
talk
of
it
i
thought
we
never
get
out
of
school
and
the
four
who
had
just
been
released
from
the
deepdale
high
school
continued
their
stroll
down
the
main
street
of
the
town
talking
over
the
new
plan
that
had
been
proposed
that
morning
by
betty
nelson
the
little
captain
as
she
was
often
called
by
her
chums
for
she
always
assumed
the
leadership
in
their
fun
and
frolics
will
we
just
walk
walk
all
the
while
asked
grace
i
afraid
i
sha
be
able
to
keep
up
to
you
girls
in
that
case
and
she
swung
about
on
the
sidewalk
in
a
few
steps
of
a
mazy
waltz
with
amy
of
course
we
wo
walk
all
the
while
explained
betty
i
have
all
the
details
arranged
yet
but
we
can
set
a
certain
number
of
miles
to
cover
each
day
at
night
we
stop
somewhere
and
rest
that
good
sighed
grace
with
a
glance
at
her
small
and
daintily
shod
feet
oh
here
comes
your
brother
will
betty
called
to
her
and
that
horrid
percy
falconer
is
with
him
went
on
mollie
i
i
bear
him
he
seen
betty
that
why
he
hurrying
so
spoke
grace
probably
he
bought
a
new
cane
he
wants
to
show
her
stop
it
commanded
betty
with
a
blush
you
know
i
ca
bear
him
any
more
than
you
girls
can
you
ca
make
percy
believe
that
my
word
and
mollie
imitated
the
mannerism
perfectly
for
young
falconer
be
it
known
was
partial
to
good
clothes
of
a
rather
flashy
type
and
much
given
to
showing
them
off
he
had
very
little
good
sense
in
fact
what
little
he
had
some
of
his
enemies
used
to
say
he
displayed
when
he
showed
a
preference
for
pretty
betty
nelson
but
she
would
have
none
of
his
company
i
do
see
why
will
wants
to
bring
him
along
remarked
his
sister
grace
in
a
petulant
tone
he
knows
we
do
like
him
perhaps
will
could
help
it
suggested
amy
that
nice
of
you
to
say
amy
commented
grace
i
tell
will
some
time
when
i
get
a
chance
do
you
dare
if
you
do
i
never
speak
to
you
again
and
the
pink
surged
to
a
deeper
red
in
amy
cheeks
betty
much
rather
have
will
pick
up
allen
washburn
remarked
mollie
in
decisive
tones
would
you
bet
oh
please
do
say
such
things
besought
betty
i
do
see
why
you
always
hush
they
hear
you
cautioned
grace
let
pretend
we
do
see
them
hurry
up
i
got
a
quarter
and
i
treat
you
to
sodas
come
on
in
pierson
drug
store
too
late
moaned
billy
in
tones
they
are
waving
to
us
we
ca
be
too
rude
will
ford
the
brother
of
grace
accompanied
by
a
rather
overdressed
youth
slightly
older
had
now
come
up
to
the
group
of
girls
good
afternoon
greeted
percy
falconer
raising
his
hat
with
an
elaborate
gesture
charming
weather
we
having
my
word
percy
rather
inclined
to
english
mannerisms
or
what
he
thought
were
such
hello
sis
and
the
rest
of
you
said
will
with
a
more
hearty
and
certainly
a
more
natural
air
what
doing
grace
was
going
to
treat
said
amy
slowly
she
is
so
good
about
that
only
oh
girls
this
is
on
me
exclaimed
percy
i
shall
be
delighted
may
i
have
the
honor
and
again
he
took
off
his
hat
with
an
elaborate
bow
shall
we
betty
telegraphed
this
question
to
her
friends
with
her
eyes
take
the
goods
the
gods
provide
murmured
grace
i
can
save
my
quarter
for
another
time
with
a
rather
resigned
air
betty
followed
her
chums
into
the
drug
store
and
presently
all
were
lined
up
before
the
counter
the
soda
delicious
murmured
grace
i
a
good
notion
to
get
some
fudge
and
she
began
toying
with
a
little
silver
purse
save
your
money
for
our
club
advised
mollie
did
you
hear
of
our
expedition
she
asked
will
no
what
that
are
you
going
to
try
for
the
east
or
west
pole
seeing
that
the
north
and
south
ones
have
been
captured
and
he
laughed
thereby
getting
some
of
the
soda
down
his
wrong
throat
serves
you
right
murmured
his
sister
as
he
coughed
betty
is
going
to
form
a
camping
and
tramping
club
went
on
amy
fine
exclaimed
percy
are
you
going
to
take
gentlemen
if
so
consider
my
application
oh
we
really
mean
to
exclaimed
grace
with
a
glance
at
the
patent
leather
shoes
the
overdressed
youth
thrust
out
ostentatiously
if
he
understood
the
allusion
he
gave
no
sign
of
so
doing
what
the
game
sis
asked
will
quizzically
why
it
is
anything
very
elaborate
explained
betty
as
she
finished
her
soda
it
occurred
to
me
that
as
school
closes
exceptionally
early
this
year
some
of
us
girls
could
go
for
a
two
weeks
tramping
tour
before
our
regular
summer
vacation
and
we
all
in
love
with
the
idea
declared
amy
twenty
miles
a
day
is
our
limit
added
mollie
smiling
behind
the
youth
back
twenty
miles
faltered
percy
you
never
can
do
it
never
oh
yes
we
can
said
betty
assuredly
now
do
you
still
wish
to
join
asked
grace
pointedly
glancing
at
percy
you
never
can
do
twenty
miles
affirmed
percy
let
have
some
more
soda
he
added
quickly
to
change
the
subject
to
the
credit
of
grace
ford
who
was
really
very
fond
of
sweets
be
it
said
that
she
refused
and
that
with
the
mocking
eyes
of
all
the
girls
fastened
on
her
i
had
enough
spoke
betty
you
walk
with
me
she
whispered
to
amy
i
do
want
percy
to
bore
me
stay
near
me
do
i
will
promised
amy
balked
of
his
design
to
stroll
beside
betty
percy
was
forced
to
be
content
with
mollie
and
she
with
malice
aforethought
talked
at
him
in
a
way
he
could
not
understand
but
which
the
other
girls
overhearing
sent
them
into
silent
spasms
of
laughter
do
you
find
it
troublesome
to
carry
a
cane
all
the
while
mollie
asked
him
sweetly
ignorant
oh
i
do
to
carry
it
he
said
quickly
do
you
i
thought
on
account
of
not
being
able
to
walk
why
mollie
i
can
walk
all
right
oh
i
misunderstood
you
you
said
twenty
miles
was
too
much
i
meant
for
girls
oh
then
you
carry
the
cane
for
dogs
no
indeed
i
not
afraid
of
dogs
he
does
know
she
him
i
believe
that
is
the
proper
english
word
is
it
whispered
grace
who
was
with
her
brother
correct
sis
whatever
did
you
want
to
bring
him
along
for
could
help
it
he
fastened
to
me
when
i
came
out
of
school
and
i
could
shake
him
off
is
bet
mad
you
know
she
does
like
him
well
tell
her
it
was
my
fault
when
you
get
the
chance
will
you
i
do
want
to
get
on
her
bad
books
i
tell
her
i
say
sis
lend
me
a
quarter
wo
you
i
broke
you
had
the
same
allowance
that
i
did
i
know
but
i
need
just
that
much
to
get
a
catching
glove
go
on
be
a
sport
i
do
say
you
have
got
it
were
you
going
to
treat
the
crowd
when
i
brought
percy
along
and
let
you
sting
him
such
horrid
slang
go
on
be
a
sport
lend
me
the
quarter
grace
produced
it
from
her
purse
there
were
several
other
coins
in
it
say
you
loaded
with
wealth
where
you
get
it
i
just
did
spend
it
go
on
and
you
with
a
box
of
chocolates
or
what
left
of
under
your
bed
will
ford
did
you
dare
go
snooping
in
my
room
and
she
grasped
his
arm
apprehensively
i
could
help
seeing
i
was
looking
for
my
ball
that
rolled
in
there
did
you
did
you
eat
them
all
she
faltered
only
a
few
there
allen
washburn
i
want
to
speak
to
him
and
will
ran
off
uncermoniously
to
join
a
tall
young
man
who
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
the
latter
seeing
the
girls
raised
his
hat
but
his
glance
rested
longest
on
betty
who
it
might
have
been
observed
blushed
slightly
under
the
scrutiny
allen
always
has
a
book
with
him
murmured
amy
yes
he
studying
law
you
know
spoke
betty
some
other
girls
joined
the
four
then
and
percy
seeing
that
he
was
rather
ignored
had
the
sense
to
leave
making
an
elaborate
departure
after
what
he
considered
the
correct
english
style
thank
goodness
murmured
mollie
puppies
are
all
right
but
i
like
ones
and
her
dark
eyes
flashed
billy
exclaimed
grace
reproachfully
shaking
an
accusing
finger
at
her
friend
well
you
do
like
him
any
more
than
than
betty
does
hush
warned
the
little
captain
he
hear
you
i
do
care
if
he
does
was
the
retort
gradually
the
main
part
of
the
town
had
been
left
as
the
girls
walked
slowly
on
houses
were
fewer
now
and
the
trees
not
so
large
nor
well
cared
for
the
sun
seemed
to
increase
in
warmth
as
it
approached
the
west
wherein
was
a
bank
of
fluffy
clouds
that
soon
would
be
turned
into
masses
of
golden
purple
and
olive
oh
girls
i
simply
must
rest
again
exclaimed
grace
as
with
a
wry
face
she
made
for
a
smooth
stump
which
was
all
that
was
left
of
a
great
oak
that
had
recently
been
cut
down
as
it
had
died
and
was
in
danger
of
falling
what
again
cried
mollie
say
grace
my
dear
you
never
will
be
able
to
keep
up
with
us
on
the
tramp
if
you
give
out
so
easily
now
what
is
the
matter
matter
look
at
her
shoes
cried
amy
such
heels
they
not
so
awful
high
and
grace
sought
to
defend
her
footwear
from
the
three
pairs
of
accusing
eyes
it
a
very
pretty
boot
remarked
betty
but
hardly
practical
my
dear
i
suppose
not
sighed
grace
but
i
just
simply
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
take
them
when
the
tried
them
on
me
i
saw
them
in
robertson
window
and
they
were
such
a
bargain
a
sample
shoe
she
said
that
why
they
so
narrow
you
can
wear
a
narrow
size
spoke
mollie
with
a
sigh
i
wish
i
could
oh
i
think
your
shoes
are
a
lovely
shape
spoke
grace
i
wish
i
had
your
high
instep
move
over
begged
amy
there
room
for
two
on
that
stump
grace
grace
obligingly
moved
and
her
friend
sat
beside
her
idly
swinging
a
couple
of
books
by
a
long
strap
betty
and
mollie
supported
themselves
by
draping
their
arms
about
each
other
waists
on
a
monument
quoted
betty
looking
at
the
two
on
the
stump
which
one
asked
mollie
with
a
laugh
we
divide
the
virtues
between
us
wo
we
amy
exclaimed
grace
putting
her
head
on
the
other
shoulder
now
i
the
sleeping
beauty
supplied
betty
do
come
on
and
after
a
little
argument
in
which
grace
insisted
that
she
had
not
had
more
than
a
minute
respite
the
four
started
off
again
they
were
approaching
the
outskirts
of
the
town
in
the
vicinity
of
which
they
all
lived
if
this
weather
keeps
up
we
ca
start
off
on
our
tramping
and
camping
trip
any
too
soon
remarked
grace
when
can
we
arrange
for
it
asked
amy
i
think
it
is
the
nicest
idea
i
ever
heard
of
you
can
all
come
over
to
my
house
suggested
betty
we
can
make
some
plans
then
perhaps
let
then
cried
impulsive
mollie
but
do
you
really
intend
to
do
any
camping
betty
yes
if
we
can
of
course
not
for
any
length
of
time
say
a
night
or
two
there
are
one
or
two
places
where
camps
are
open
the
year
around
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
go
there
and
board
just
as
you
would
at
a
hotel
only
it
must
be
much
nicer
said
amy
it
is
lots
they
had
reached
a
place
where
the
highway
ran
under
a
railroad
line
that
crossed
on
a
high
bridge
as
the
girls
came
under
the
structure
a
fluttering
bit
of
paper
on
the
ground
caught
the
eyes
of
betty
rather
idly
she
picked
it
up
and
the
next
moment
she
uttered
a
cry
that
brought
her
chums
to
her
side
in
some
alarm
look
she
exclaimed
a
five
hundred
dollar
bill
is
pinned
to
this
paper
a
five
hundred
dollar
bill
girls
chapter
ii
the
tramping
club
with
staring
eyes
and
with
breaths
that
were
labored
the
three
chums
gathered
about
betty
she
held
the
bill
and
the
paper
pinned
to
it
stretched
tightly
between
her
slim
fingers
is
it
is
it
real
gasped
grace
of
course
it
real
declared
amy
how
do
you
know
asked
mollie
i
confess
i
never
saw
a
five
hundred
dollar
bill
all
at
once
before
did
you
see
it
in
pieces
asked
grace
what
a
lot
of
money
how
many
pounds
of
chocolates
would
it
buy
asked
amy
with
a
laugh
do
you
dare
say
chocolate
to
me
commanded
grace
it
is
real
went
on
betty
who
had
not
spoken
since
picking
up
the
money
there
no
doubt
of
that
if
findings
were
keepings
you
be
well
off
said
mollie
how
lucky
you
are
and
sighed
of
course
i
ca
keep
it
decided
betty
but
i
wonder
who
could
have
dropped
it
and
she
looked
up
at
the
railroad
bridge
over
their
heads
as
if
she
might
see
some
one
standing
there
waiting
for
the
return
of
the
bill
what
is
that
paper
pinned
to
it
asked
grace
as
she
took
hold
of
it
while
betty
held
the
bank
note
by
the
two
ends
that
so
i
forgot
to
look
at
that
said
the
finder
she
turned
it
over
there
was
some
writing
on
it
it
said
this
is
my
last
five
hundred
dollar
bill
all
that
is
left
of
my
fortune
this
is
to
remind
me
that
if
i
do
make
good
use
of
this
i
do
deserve
any
more
luck
it
is
make
or
break
with
me
now
which
will
it
be
the
girls
were
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
after
reading
this
strange
message
that
had
come
to
them
in
such
a
queer
manner
then
betty
said
girls
what
do
you
make
of
it
it
a
joke
declared
grace
it
sounds
far
from
being
a
joke
spoke
betty
seriously
girls
there
may
be
a
grim
tragedy
here
how
romantic
sighed
mollie
what
shall
we
do
with
the
money
we
must
take
it
home
and
consult
our
folks
about
it
decided
betty
i
ask
papa
and
you
might
refer
the
question
to
yours
amy
being
a
broker
he
quite
likely
to
know
about
such
things
and
can
tell
us
what
to
do
this
is
quite
a
lot
of
money
to
lose
i
wonder
how
we
can
find
the
owner
advertise
maybe
there
be
a
notice
in
the
post
office
it
ca
have
been
here
very
long
perhaps
we
meet
whoever
it
belongs
to
coming
back
to
look
for
it
spoke
grace
thus
came
some
opinions
and
while
various
others
were
rapidly
formed
and
expressed
and
as
the
girls
are
speculating
on
how
the
bill
and
the
attached
paper
came
to
lie
so
openly
on
the
highway
i
hope
i
may
be
permitted
to
insert
here
a
little
descriptive
matter
that
will
perhaps
give
the
reader
a
clearer
understanding
of
the
characters
of
this
story
and
as
betty
nelson
had
by
right
of
more
than
one
informal
conquest
reached
the
position
of
leader
i
can
do
no
better
than
begin
with
her
betty
was
about
sixteen
years
old
she
was
not
exactly
what
one
would
call
pretty
that
is
at
first
glance
more
likely
she
would
have
been
spoken
of
as
at
least
by
the
boys
and
certainly
betty
was
good
to
look
upon
her
face
showed
her
character
there
was
a
calm
thoughtfulness
about
it
that
suggested
strength
of
mind
and
yet
it
was
not
the
type
of
face
called
strong
it
was
purely
girlish
and
it
reflected
her
bright
and
vivacious
manner
perfectly
how
her
features
lighted
up
when
she
spoke
or
listened
her
friends
well
knew
her
eyes
seemed
always
to
be
dancing
with
fun
yet
they
could
look
calmly
at
trouble
too
and
when
betty
nelson
looked
at
trouble
that
same
trouble
seemed
to
melt
away
to
flee
as
though
it
had
no
right
to
exist
and
this
not
only
as
regarded
her
own
troubles
but
those
of
her
friends
as
well
intensely
practical
was
betty
yet
there
was
a
shade
of
romance
in
her
character
that
few
suspected
perhaps
the
other
girls
had
so
often
taken
their
little
troubles
to
betty
listening
to
her
advice
and
sympathy
that
they
forgot
she
might
have
some
of
her
own
but
under
it
all
betty
had
a
romantic
nature
that
needed
but
a
certain
influence
to
bring
it
out
full
of
life
and
vigor
she
was
always
ready
to
assume
the
leadership
in
whatever
of
fun
or
work
was
at
hand
perhaps
that
is
why
she
was
often
called
the
little
captain
and
certainly
she
deserved
the
name
her
father
charles
nelson
was
a
wealthy
carpet
manufacturer
his
factory
being
just
outside
of
deepdale
and
her
mother
rose
was
one
of
the
society
leaders
of
the
town
though
there
was
no
elaborate
social
system
a
regular
gibson
girl
was
grace
ford
not
only
in
form
but
in
face
there
was
that
chin
and
the
neck
on
which
was
poised
a
head
with
a
wonderful
wealth
of
light
hair
the
other
girls
rather
envied
grace
her
hair
especially
mollie
who
was
a
decided
brunette
and
as
i
have
said
grace
dressed
to
advantage
there
had
been
a
time
when
she
bemoaned
the
fact
that
she
was
tall
regular
her
brother
had
taunted
her
with
being
and
grace
well
she
had
slapped
him
but
this
was
some
years
ago
but
now
with
the
newer
styles
that
seem
to
forbid
the
existence
of
hips
and
with
skirts
that
so
circumscribe
the
steps
that
fast
walking
is
impossible
grace
fitted
in
perfectly
she
was
artistically
tall
and
slender
which
fact
none
knew
better
than
she
herself
but
grace
was
not
vain
she
did
pose
at
times
but
it
was
done
naturally
and
without
undue
thought
she
just
could
not
help
it
her
brother
will
made
no
end
of
fun
about
her
even
at
this
date
but
grace
had
sufficient
composure
to
ignore
him
now
and
only
smiled
sweetly
remarking
you
only
show
how
little
you
know
run
along
now
and
play
ball
then
will
trying
to
think
of
some
cutting
thing
to
say
would
hasten
to
join
his
bosom
friend
frank
haley
perhaps
remarking
as
they
tramped
off
hanged
if
i
can
understand
girls
anyhow
why
what
up
oh
grace
is
such
a
primper
she
got
a
new
dress
and
some
sort
of
fancy
dingus
on
it
does
mix
in
right
she
says
it
makes
her
look
too
stout
and
she
going
to
have
it
changed
hum
i
think
your
sister
is
a
mighty
girl
i
tell
her
you
said
so
if
you
do
i
rub
your
nose
in
the
mud
and
then
as
they
thought
philosophising
further
on
the
queerness
of
girls
in
general
the
boys
departed
to
the
ball
field
the
father
of
grace
and
will
ford
was
a
lawyer
with
more
than
a
local
reputation
he
was
often
called
on
to
handle
big
cases
of
interest
and
had
made
a
modest
fortune
in
the
practice
of
his
profession
of
mollie
billette
billy
to
her
chums
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
aged
fifteen
the
daughter
of
a
widow
pauline
billette
mollie
seemed
older
than
either
betty
or
grace
though
she
was
a
year
younger
yet
she
did
not
assume
anything
to
herself
by
reason
of
this
seeming
difference
in
years
and
the
difference
was
only
seeming
perhaps
it
was
that
bit
of
french
blood
making
her
so
so
vivacious
so
that
accounted
for
it
and
it
was
very
likely
that
same
french
blood
that
gave
her
a
temper
which
was
not
to
be
admired
and
which
mollie
tried
so
hard
to
conquer
but
her
friends
knew
her
failing
and
readily
forgave
her
besides
mollie
there
were
the
comical
twins
dora
never
called
anything
but
dodo
and
paul
aged
four
they
were
always
getting
into
mischief
and
out
again
and
were
just
too
sweet
and
dear
for
anything
as
betty
put
it
betty
being
an
only
child
rather
hungered
for
brothers
and
sisters
and
now
we
come
to
amy
stonington
poor
amy
there
was
something
of
a
mystery
about
her
she
realized
something
of
it
herself
when
she
was
old
enough
to
know
that
she
was
not
in
physical
characteristics
at
all
like
her
parents
at
least
she
regarded
and
john
stonington
as
her
parents
and
yet
she
could
not
understand
why
she
was
not
more
like
them
in
type
nor
why
of
late
she
had
often
come
upon
them
talking
earnestly
together
which
talk
ceased
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
room
in
consequence
of
which
amy
was
not
very
happy
these
days
yet
the
most
that
she
feared
was
that
her
parents
were
mapping
out
a
career
for
her
she
was
talented
in
music
playing
the
piano
with
a
technique
and
fire
that
few
girls
of
her
age
could
equal
more
than
once
after
a
simple
concert
in
the
high
school
at
which
she
played
teachers
had
urged
and
stonington
to
send
her
to
some
teacher
or
even
abroad
to
study
but
if
that
what
they
planning
i
just
wo
go
said
amy
to
herself
after
one
of
those
queer
confidences
she
had
broken
up
i
die
of
loneliness
if
they
sent
me
away
so
much
for
our
four
girls
dear
deepdale
the
girls
always
called
it
dear
deepdale
they
always
spoke
affectionately
of
their
home
town
the
only
residence
place
any
of
them
had
ever
really
known
for
though
some
of
them
had
lived
as
children
in
other
places
their
years
since
they
were
old
enough
to
appreciate
localities
had
been
spent
in
deepdale
and
certainly
it
was
a
town
of
much
natural
beauty
to
which
a
certain
amount
of
civic
pride
added
had
made
for
local
enjoyment
in
parks
memorials
and
statues
though
there
were
only
about
fifteen
thousand
residents
there
was
a
spirit
about
deepdale
that
many
a
city
might
have
envied
a
spirit
of
progress
deepdale
was
situated
on
the
argono
river
which
gave
a
natural
advantage
and
provided
a
setting
that
could
not
be
improved
upon
the
stream
ran
around
two
sides
of
the
place
the
waters
curling
gracefully
around
a
bend
which
had
been
laid
out
in
a
little
pleasure
park
there
were
some
who
protested
against
this
waste
of
good
and
valuable
dockage
facilities
but
the
town
committeemen
wisely
ignoring
objections
had
at
some
cost
acquired
the
land
and
made
what
was
one
of
the
prettiest
spots
for
miles
around
a
little
breathing
place
on
the
very
edge
of
the
beautiful
river
nor
was
the
river
the
only
attractive
bit
of
water
about
deepdale
the
stream
emptied
into
rainbow
lake
some
miles
below
the
town
and
rainbow
lake
fully
justified
its
name
it
was
a
favorite
scene
of
canoeing
and
parties
and
many
summer
residences
dotted
its
shores
in
summer
white
tents
of
campers
gleamed
beneath
the
trees
on
its
banks
situated
in
the
lake
were
a
number
of
islands
also
camping
sites
and
much
frequented
in
summer
by
little
parties
of
young
people
who
landed
there
after
a
trip
on
the
lake
to
rest
in
the
shade
of
the
leafy
trees
triangle
island
so
called
from
its
shore
outline
was
the
largest
of
those
that
seemed
floating
on
the
lake
like
green
jewels
in
a
setting
of
silver
several
steamers
of
good
size
plied
on
the
argono
river
one
a
freight
and
passenger
boat
belonging
to
a
local
line
going
as
far
as
clammerport
at
the
foot
of
the
lake
often
school
society
excursions
were
held
and
the
boys
and
girls
made
merry
on
the
trip
about
deepdale
were
several
thriving
farming
communities
for
the
slightly
rolling
land
was
well
suited
to
cultivation
the
town
and
the
outlying
farms
filled
a
sort
of
valley
girt
around
with
hills
of
sufficient
size
and
height
to
be
called
mountains
at
least
by
the
local
inhabitants
who
were
proud
of
them
there
were
valleys
in
these
mountains
some
large
and
others
merely
glens
though
shadow
valley
one
of
the
most
beautiful
was
only
of
medium
size
it
was
a
favorite
spot
for
excursionists
who
wanted
a
change
from
the
water
route
there
being
a
sort
of
summer
resort
and
picnic
ground
at
one
end
of
this
valley
the
other
end
was
not
so
often
visited
it
had
once
formed
the
estate
of
a
very
wealthy
man
who
built
a
large
mansion
there
but
on
his
death
the
property
was
contested
for
in
the
courts
by
several
heirs
and
for
years
had
been
tied
up
by
litigation
so
the
mansion
became
deserted
of
sufficient
importance
to
have
a
railroad
as
well
as
a
steamer
line
deepdale
was
well
provided
with
transportation
facilities
true
the
railway
was
only
a
branch
one
but
it
connected
with
the
main
road
running
to
new
york
and
this
was
enough
for
the
people
of
deepdale
the
town
also
boasted
of
a
paper
the
and
there
was
a
good
high
and
grammar
school
in
town
besides
numerous
stores
and
other
establishments
including
a
moving
picture
theatre
this
last
rather
an
innovation
our
girls
i
call
them
ours
for
it
is
with
their
fortunes
that
we
shall
be
chiefly
concerned
our
girls
lived
near
each
other
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
betty
and
her
parents
occupied
an
stone
house
that
had
once
been
the
manor
of
a
farm
but
it
was
outwardly
only
for
within
it
was
the
embodiment
of
culture
and
comfort
it
set
well
back
from
the
street
and
a
lane
of
elms
led
from
the
front
porch
to
the
thoroughfare
back
of
the
house
was
an
garden
likewise
and
there
were
the
remains
of
an
apple
orchard
some
of
the
trees
still
bearing
fruit
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
not
far
off
was
the
home
of
grace
a
modern
brick
house
of
tasteful
design
it
had
ample
grounds
about
it
though
being
rather
new
could
not
boast
of
such
noble
trees
as
those
that
added
dignity
to
the
old
stone
house
amy
stonington
lived
in
a
large
rambling
wooden
structure
too
large
for
the
needs
of
the
family
but
artistic
nevertheless
it
was
just
around
the
corner
from
the
residence
of
betty
and
the
yards
of
the
two
girls
joined
you
can
call
the
big
orchard
of
betty
home
a
yard
mollie
home
was
near
the
river
about
ten
minutes
walk
from
that
of
the
other
three
girls
it
was
a
wooden
house
of
a
dull
red
that
mingled
well
in
tone
with
the
green
grass
and
the
spreading
trees
that
surrounded
it
and
now
i
believe
i
have
mentioned
my
principal
characters
and
places
though
others
will
be
introduced
to
you
from
time
to
time
as
our
story
progresses
so
on
this
pleasant
spring
day
for
one
of
the
few
times
amy
was
not
brooding
on
the
subject
that
had
given
her
such
uneasiness
of
late
nor
were
the
other
girls
concerned
with
anything
save
the
finding
of
the
five
hundred
dollar
bill
which
absorbed
everything
else
for
the
time
being
who
could
have
lost
it
wondered
mollie
there
are
so
many
persons
in
deepdale
who
can
afford
to
throw
away
money
like
this
added
amy
it
was
thrown
away
it
was
lost
declared
betty
and
we
must
find
the
owner
if
we
can
especially
after
such
a
pathetic
message
said
grace
poor
fellow
his
last
big
bill
what
makes
you
think
it
was
a
asked
amy
that
is
a
girl
writing
insisted
grace
fine
you
be
a
detective
if
you
keep
on
or
should
i
say
detectivess
asked
mollie
with
a
laugh
i
wonder
what
that
note
means
inquired
mollie
why
said
betty
it
seems
to
indicate
that
some
young
man
ran
through
a
fortune
or
lost
it
and
had
only
five
hundred
dollars
left
he
was
going
to
try
to
redeem
his
standing
or
wealth
with
this
and
probably
wrote
this
to
remind
himself
not
to
fail
i
used
to
have
a
habit
of
leaving
my
room
untidy
and
daddy
suggested
once
that
i
write
a
notice
to
myself
and
pin
it
where
i
would
see
it
as
i
came
out
each
morning
i
did
and
i
cured
myself
this
young
fellow
probably
tried
the
same
system
what
makes
you
think
he
is
grace
wanted
to
know
i
following
your
line
of
reasoning
no
elderly
man
would
do
anything
like
this
write
such
a
strange
memorandum
to
himself
sure
he
is
young
and
asked
amy
smiling
let
us
hope
so
if
we
are
to
return
the
money
to
him
in
person
suggested
mollie
well
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
put
that
in
some
secure
place
betty
advised
grace
has
your
father
a
safe
at
home
yes
then
let
him
keep
it
and
we
can
put
an
advertisement
in
the
a
sum
of
money
owner
can
have
same
by
proving
property
and
paying
for
this
advertisement
how
is
that
would
you
ask
for
a
reward
came
from
mollie
the
idea
of
course
not
but
he
might
us
one
suggested
amy
without
being
asked
then
talking
excitedly
about
the
find
and
speculating
on
how
it
could
have
come
in
the
road
the
girls
accompanied
betty
to
her
house
nelson
was
duly
astonished
at
the
news
and
agreed
with
the
chums
that
the
best
plan
was
that
suggested
by
grace
accordingly
when
nelson
came
home
the
bill
and
the
queer
attached
note
were
put
in
his
safe
then
an
advertisement
was
telephoned
to
the
paper
and
now
let
talk
about
our
camping
and
tramping
club
proposed
betty
for
her
three
chums
had
called
that
evening
after
supper
i
spoke
to
mamma
about
it
said
mollie
and
she
said
she
thought
i
could
go
but
we
must
stay
with
friends
or
relatives
at
night
she
wo
let
me
put
up
at
a
hotel
of
course
not
cried
betty
none
of
us
will
now
my
plan
is
this
papa
and
mamma
have
a
number
of
relatives
living
in
distant
towns
but
all
in
this
vicinity
probably
you
girls
have
some
also
now
why
could
we
arrange
a
tour
that
would
take
us
on
a
circuit
say
of
two
hundred
miles
two
hundred
miles
came
in
a
horrified
chorus
why
yes
that
not
much
we
can
take
three
weeks
to
it
and
only
a
little
over
ten
miles
a
day
not
counting
sundays
of
course
if
we
ca
walk
ten
miles
a
day
oh
that
not
so
bad
admitted
amy
i
can
easily
do
that
assented
mollie
what
about
our
meals
asked
grace
ca
you
carry
enough
chocolate
fudge
to
do
between
morning
and
evening
asked
amy
with
a
laugh
i
got
that
part
all
planned
began
betty
or
at
least
i
have
an
idea
about
it
we
can
get
breakfast
and
supper
at
our
friends
or
relatives
and
at
noon
we
can
go
to
restaurants
or
to
houses
along
the
way
why
we
can
even
take
a
little
camping
outfit
with
us
and
make
coffee
on
the
road
carrying
sandwiches
too
fine
cried
amy
and
mollie
make
chocolate
not
coffee
begged
grace
well
chocolate
then
assented
betty
i
have
a
couple
of
aunts
somewhere
out
bessingford
way
spoke
amy
and
mamma
has
a
cousin
or
two
near
millford
went
on
grace
now
it
your
turn
mollie
said
betty
oh
i
have
some
relations
scattered
about
the
country
exclaimed
the
french
girl
her
eyes
sparkling
i
guess
they
would
be
glad
to
entertain
us
and
i
can
fill
in
the
with
uncles
and
aunts
and
cousins
i
think
spoke
betty
now
let
make
out
a
partial
list
it
took
some
little
time
to
do
this
but
it
was
finally
accomplished
well
shall
we
decide
on
it
asked
betty
after
a
pause
shall
we
form
the
deepdale
camping
and
tramping
club
i
move
you
miss
chairman
that
we
do
exclaimed
grace
the
sooner
the
better
second
the
motion
came
laughingly
from
mollie
all
in
favor
aye
came
in
a
joyous
chorus
and
the
little
club
was
thus
quickly
formed
chapter
iii
jealousies
what
do
they
find
to
talk
about
so
often
and
so
secretly
as
soon
as
any
of
us
other
girls
come
near
they
begin
to
speak
of
the
weather
or
something
like
that
thus
remarked
alice
jallow
to
kittie
rossmore
a
few
days
after
the
formation
of
the
camping
and
tramping
club
the
question
and
comments
took
place
in
the
court
of
the
high
school
just
before
the
bell
was
to
ring
for
the
morning
session
it
all
betty
nelson
doings
declared
alice
who
had
often
tried
to
make
herself
more
intimate
with
the
quartette
of
friends
but
unsuccessfully
the
other
girls
did
not
care
for
these
two
yes
grace
mollie
and
amy
will
do
anything
betty
tells
them
asserted
kittie
i
do
see
why
she
is
so
popular
she
has
a
bit
of
style
about
her
i
should
say
not
her
skirt
is
entirely
too
wide
and
her
blouse
never
seems
cut
right
they
say
her
mother
does
believe
in
style
but
i
do
said
alice
i
rather
have
a
cheap
dress
if
it
was
in
style
than
something
even
if
it
cost
a
lot
more
so
would
i
look
at
them
now
with
their
heads
together
i
wonder
if
they
going
to
have
a
dance
i
do
know
how
can
we
find
out
leave
it
to
me
jennie
plum
is
quite
friendly
with
mollie
i
get
her
to
ask
some
questions
do
and
then
tell
me
i
sure
they
getting
up
some
affair
i
should
wonder
if
they
only
ask
us
we
have
a
right
to
be
asked
and
alice
flared
up
the
warning
bell
interrupted
further
conversation
and
the
girls
and
boys
filed
into
their
classrooms
as
alice
had
remarked
there
was
a
good
deal
of
talk
going
on
among
the
four
members
of
the
camping
and
tramping
club
every
spare
moment
the
four
seemed
to
have
something
to
say
to
each
other
as
one
or
the
other
thought
of
some
new
point
to
consider
following
the
hasty
formation
of
the
organization
the
girls
had
sent
letters
to
their
friends
and
relatives
asking
if
it
would
be
convenient
to
entertain
them
some
favorable
answers
had
been
received
others
were
delayed
there
were
no
refusals
as
soon
as
we
know
on
whom
we
can
depend
we
can
make
up
a
schedule
itinerary
betty
had
said
we
will
know
just
where
we
will
stop
each
night
so
the
folks
can
send
us
word
if
they
have
to
she
added
why
should
they
have
to
unless
something
happens
asked
amy
oh
that
five
hundred
dollar
bill
might
be
claimed
said
betty
want
to
know
about
that
and
you
have
heard
a
word
yet
asked
grace
not
a
word
i
telephoned
to
the
paper
and
they
said
no
replies
had
come
in
there
if
that
young
man
is
depending
on
this
money
to
make
his
fortune
i
afraid
he
be
broken
instead
of
made
to
use
his
own
expression
and
betty
sighed
the
warning
bell
had
broken
in
on
their
talk
as
it
had
on
that
of
the
rival
girls
and
then
began
the
school
day
it
was
warm
very
warm
for
that
time
of
year
being
early
may
and
as
the
members
of
the
new
camping
and
tramping
club
looked
from
the
open
windows
out
to
where
spring
was
already
forcing
into
bloom
the
flowers
and
urging
the
trees
to
greater
activity
as
regards
the
tender
green
leaves
there
came
an
almost
overpowering
desire
to
toss
aside
books
and
papers
and
get
out
where
the
smell
of
the
brown
earth
mingled
with
the
perfume
of
growing
vegetation
the
teachers
doubtless
found
it
difficult
also
for
the
call
of
nature
manifested
itself
to
them
and
the
girls
and
boys
rather
selfishly
did
not
make
it
as
easy
as
they
might
the
noon
recess
again
brought
the
four
friends
together
and
betty
showed
a
tentative
program
she
had
surreptitiously
scribbled
during
a
study
period
it
contained
the
names
of
towns
with
the
available
relatives
of
the
girls
set
down
opposite
each
one
and
a
rough
calculation
of
the
time
required
to
walk
from
one
place
to
the
other
it
seems
as
if
we
ought
to
start
at
once
exclaimed
mollie
are
you
just
dying
to
go
amy
i
am
yes
there
was
hesitation
in
the
tones
why
what
is
the
matter
asked
grace
quickly
are
you
ill
amy
for
the
girl
looked
pale
and
there
were
dark
circles
under
her
eyes
no
i
all
right
but
papa
and
mamma
do
seem
to
want
me
to
go
at
least
they
say
they
rather
i
would
not
just
at
present
the
idea
after
we
have
it
almost
all
arranged
why
not
these
comments
and
the
question
were
fairly
shot
at
amy
i
i
do
know
she
faltered
at
first
they
did
not
seem
to
mind
but
last
night
oh
i
dare
say
it
will
be
all
right
girls
do
mind
me
and
amy
tried
to
smile
though
it
could
easily
be
seen
that
it
cost
her
an
effort
she
did
not
want
to
tell
that
she
had
overheard
her
parents
discussing
something
the
night
before
that
troubled
her
a
topic
that
had
been
hushed
when
she
unexpectedly
came
into
the
room
and
that
it
had
to
do
with
the
proposed
little
trip
amy
was
sure
yet
and
stonington
had
at
first
shown
much
interest
in
it
and
had
written
to
various
relatives
asking
them
to
entertain
the
girls
stuck
up
things
murmured
alice
jallow
toward
the
close
of
the
noon
recess
when
the
four
chums
had
kept
to
one
corner
of
the
school
court
eating
their
lunches
and
never
joining
in
the
activities
or
talk
of
the
other
pupils
i
wonder
what
they
can
be
planning
murmured
alice
if
getting
up
a
new
society
we
do
the
same
and
we
wo
ask
them
to
join
indeed
we
wo
agreed
her
chum
that
betty
nelson
thinks
she
can
run
the
school
i
show
her
that
she
ca
and
if
they
knew
what
i
know
about
amy
stonington
i
do
believe
be
so
thick
with
her
what
do
you
mean
it
a
secret
oh
tell
me
alice
pleaded
kittie
you
know
i
wo
ever
tell
honest
promise
promise
well
then
oh
come
over
here
there
that
horrid
sadie
jones
trying
to
hear
what
we
saying
and
the
two
girls
arm
in
arm
strolled
off
to
a
distant
part
of
the
court
the
afternoon
session
wore
on
the
day
grew
warmer
the
sky
became
overcast
and
there
was
the
dull
muttering
of
distant
thunder
there
seemed
a
tension
in
the
air
as
if
something
was
going
to
snap
doubtless
you
have
often
felt
it
a
sensation
as
though
pins
and
needles
were
pricking
you
all
over
as
though
you
wanted
to
scream
to
cry
out
against
an
uncertain
sensation
that
gripped
you
in
the
various
classrooms
the
droning
voices
were
heard
of
the
pupils
in
recitations
or
of
the
teachers
as
they
patiently
explained
some
point
the
thunder
rumbled
nearer
and
nearer
now
and
then
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
split
the
sombre
clouds
at
such
times
the
nervous
girls
would
jump
in
their
seats
and
there
would
follow
hysterical
though
quickly
subdued
bursts
of
laughter
from
their
more
stolid
mates
or
the
boys
the
four
who
were
to
go
on
the
walking
tour
together
were
in
the
latin
class
amy
was
standing
up
translating
or
trying
to
translate
a
passage
from
caesar
she
halted
and
stammered
though
usually
she
got
perfect
marks
in
this
study
take
it
a
bit
slower
miss
stonington
suggested
miss
greene
the
teacher
that
is
very
good
you
should
know
that
word
take
your
time
said
amy
faintly
not
ever
there
was
a
titter
from
alice
jallow
in
which
kittie
rossmore
joined
poor
amy
looked
distressed
tears
came
into
her
eyes
there
shot
across
the
black
heavens
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
and
a
bursting
crash
so
promptly
came
echoing
that
nearly
every
one
of
the
girls
started
from
her
desk
and
a
number
screamed
while
even
the
boys
were
startled
then
with
a
low
moan
amy
swayed
and
fell
backward
into
the
arms
of
betty
she
fainted
exclaimed
miss
greene
girls
keep
quiet
some
one
get
me
a
glass
of
water
there
was
a
stir
among
the
boys
who
occupied
one
side
of
the
big
room
and
frank
haley
hastened
out
chapter
iv
a
taunt
with
a
great
crash
a
deluge
of
rain
a
wind
that
swept
the
spray
across
the
school
room
and
the
rumbling
of
thunder
punctuated
by
vivid
hissing
flashes
of
lightning
the
storm
broke
at
once
the
tension
that
of
nature
as
well
as
that
of
the
nerves
of
the
girls
was
relieved
a
sound
like
a
great
sigh
was
heard
in
the
room
there
were
one
or
two
faint
cries
some
laughter
and
the
members
of
the
class
were
themselves
again
the
balance
had
been
restored
she
will
be
all
right
presently
said
miss
greene
quietly
as
she
helped
place
amy
on
a
couch
in
her
own
private
room
close
some
of
the
windows
girls
the
rain
is
coming
in
her
firm
and
cheering
words
and
her
calm
manner
aided
in
the
work
of
restoration
that
had
begun
when
the
was
lessened
the
girls
were
themselves
again
most
of
them
going
quietly
to
their
seats
while
betty
and
grace
helped
miss
greene
restore
amy
to
consciousness
they
had
loosed
her
collar
and
some
ammonia
had
been
procured
from
the
physics
laboratory
by
frank
who
also
brought
water
i
ca
imagine
what
made
her
faint
whispered
grace
she
never
did
such
a
thing
before
probably
it
was
the
storm
said
the
teacher
i
have
often
noticed
that
just
before
a
severe
electrical
disturbance
i
felt
flying
to
pieces
to
put
it
crudely
then
when
the
rain
came
i
would
get
calm
again
i
remarked
that
amy
did
not
seem
quite
herself
while
reciting
and
perhaps
i
should
have
excused
her
but
i
hoped
by
letting
her
fix
her
attention
on
the
lesson
that
the
little
spell
might
pass
over
it
was
that
horrid
alice
jallow
giggling
at
her
declared
mollie
who
had
come
softly
into
the
room
i
could
she
clenched
her
hands
and
her
dark
eyes
gleamed
mollie
said
betty
softly
and
the
threatened
fit
of
anger
passed
over
she
will
come
to
in
a
moment
remarked
miss
greene
as
she
saw
eyelids
fluttering
it
was
just
a
nervous
strain
i
have
seen
it
happen
before
not
with
amy
declared
grace
positively
no
but
in
other
girls
i
do
hope
amy
is
going
to
be
ill
said
betty
we
want
her
to
come
on
the
walk
with
us
i
have
heard
of
your
little
club
said
the
teacher
with
a
smile
the
idea
is
a
very
good
one
i
hope
you
have
a
pleasant
time
i
think
it
will
do
all
of
you
good
i
wish
more
of
my
girls
would
take
up
systematic
walking
we
would
have
better
recitations
i
think
poor
amy
murmured
grace
i
wonder
what
could
have
caused
it
and
she
looked
down
at
her
pale
little
chum
it
was
because
alice
laughed
at
her
declared
mollie
half
fiercely
i
think
not
spoke
betty
softly
amy
has
not
been
quite
herself
of
late
she
but
she
was
not
destined
to
finish
that
sentence
for
the
girl
under
discussion
opened
her
eyes
and
struggled
to
sit
up
you
all
right
said
miss
greene
softly
lie
still
my
dear
where
am
i
what
happened
oh
i
remember
did
i
faint
and
she
asked
the
question
in
some
alarm
you
did
my
dear
but
there
was
no
harm
in
that
spoke
miss
greene
softly
and
she
laughed
in
a
low
voice
i
i
never
did
such
a
thing
before
what
made
me
the
storm
amy
it
was
the
electrical
disturbance
i
think
my
how
it
rains
a
perfect
deluge
was
descending
but
it
had
brought
a
calm
to
the
waiting
earth
and
calm
to
tired
girlish
nerves
as
well
amy
sighed
and
then
sat
up
the
color
came
back
into
her
pale
face
i
am
all
right
now
she
said
more
firmly
and
was
soon
able
to
walk
stay
here
a
little
longer
urged
miss
greene
betty
mollie
and
grace
may
remain
with
you
i
will
go
out
to
the
other
pupils
some
of
them
may
be
alarmed
a
crash
of
thunder
almost
smothered
her
words
and
the
girls
started
nervously
the
three
glanced
apprehensively
at
amy
but
she
smiled
bravely
and
said
do
worry
about
me
i
all
right
it
was
silly
of
me
to
go
off
that
way
the
storm
raged
and
tore
about
the
school
and
gradually
spent
its
fury
miss
greene
gave
up
the
attempt
to
have
a
latin
recitation
and
the
class
was
permitted
to
engage
in
general
conversation
it
was
the
final
period
of
the
day
and
soon
school
was
over
most
of
the
girls
remained
however
for
few
had
brought
rain
coats
or
umbrellas
there
being
no
hint
that
morning
of
the
deluge
that
was
to
come
then
the
rain
gradually
slackened
and
the
pupils
departed
do
come
to
school
if
you
do
feel
well
urged
miss
greene
as
amy
and
her
chums
left
oh
i
be
all
right
she
brightly
answered
i
wish
we
were
going
to
start
on
our
tramp
exclaimed
betty
as
they
walked
along
the
damp
country
road
toward
their
homes
the
sweet
smell
of
the
earth
mingling
with
the
scent
of
grass
and
flowers
the
country
is
just
lovely
now
it
will
still
be
as
lovely
next
month
said
mollie
only
two
weeks
more
of
school
and
then
we
will
be
on
our
way
do
you
feel
all
right
amy
asked
grace
have
a
no
she
wo
have
a
if
that
what
you
going
to
say
spoke
mollie
quickly
do
you
want
to
make
her
get
worse
i
was
going
to
say
chocolate
so
there
snapped
the
usually
grace
do
be
so
quick
billy
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
and
the
french
girl
showed
her
contrition
i
forgot
you
can
think
of
something
beside
candy
i
was
going
to
ask
her
if
she
wanted
my
smelling
salts
grace
went
on
and
amy
accepted
the
little
bottle
there
was
much
talk
that
afternoon
of
the
coming
trip
some
further
letters
had
been
received
from
relatives
who
would
welcome
the
girls
at
the
various
stopping
places
this
about
completes
our
schedule
remarked
betty
as
she
noted
down
on
a
map
she
had
drawn
the
names
of
some
persons
and
places
everything
is
coming
on
fine
girls
is
it
nice
exclaimed
mollie
you
sure
to
come
are
you
amy
asked
grace
yes
of
course
that
is
a
shadow
seemed
to
pass
over
her
face
and
then
her
pale
cheeks
became
pink
oh
i
guess
you
can
count
on
me
she
finally
declared
i
was
just
thinking
oh
it
does
matter
let
see
now
betty
how
many
stopping
places
do
you
count
on
about
eight
of
course
there
may
be
more
and
we
may
have
to
stay
in
one
place
longer
than
i
figure
on
and
we
might
skip
some
places
altogether
what
about
the
camp
asked
mollie
i
am
arranging
for
that
spoke
grace
papa
lives
in
cameron
he
and
his
wife
maintain
a
sort
of
camp
there
for
those
who
love
the
woods
and
outdoors
mamma
has
written
and
arrangements
will
be
made
for
us
to
have
a
cabin
or
bungalow
there
for
a
few
days
wo
it
be
glorious
cried
mollie
taking
amy
in
a
waltzing
hold
and
whirling
about
the
room
with
her
while
she
hummed
a
dreamy
song
they
were
at
betty
house
discussing
their
coming
trip
and
it
was
nearly
supper
time
when
they
dispersed
grace
insisted
on
accompanying
amy
part
of
the
way
home
i
do
want
you
to
faint
again
and
be
all
by
yourself
she
said
silly
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
declared
amy
but
grace
had
her
way
it
was
the
next
afternoon
when
betty
and
grace
were
having
a
game
of
tennis
on
the
court
that
had
been
laid
out
back
of
the
high
school
that
alice
jallow
and
kittie
rossmore
came
past
arm
in
arm
they
paused
for
a
moment
to
watch
the
game
and
during
a
lull
alice
remarked
when
does
the
tramping
club
start
as
soon
as
school
closes
replied
betty
for
the
term
ended
unusually
early
that
year
have
you
the
party
all
made
up
inquired
kittie
and
it
was
evident
that
she
had
a
reason
for
asking
pretty
much
answered
betty
wondering
what
was
to
follow
it
your
serve
she
added
to
grace
alice
and
i
are
very
fond
of
walking
proceeded
kittie
we
thought
if
the
camping
and
tramping
club
was
to
be
a
general
one
that
is
if
you
wanted
more
members
we
like
to
join
betty
caught
her
breath
it
was
a
hard
answer
to
give
i
awfully
sorry
she
said
softly
coming
over
to
where
alice
and
kittie
stood
if
we
had
known
before
we
might
have
arranged
it
but
our
membership
is
limited
to
four
now
you
four
i
presume
and
there
was
almost
a
sneer
in
the
voice
of
alice
as
she
looked
at
the
four
chums
yes
it
so
happens
you
see
we
are
going
to
stop
each
night
at
the
houses
of
friends
or
relatives
and
of
course
i
see
the
accommodations
are
limited
are
they
and
again
that
sneer
was
manifest
yes
they
are
i
sorry
to
say
spoke
betty
but
why
do
you
girls
form
another
club
you
could
easily
do
that
and
we
could
be
together
all
day
if
not
at
night
why
do
you
she
asked
brightly
we
might
said
alice
cooly
come
on
kittie
she
added
i
guess
we
not
wanted
here
the
idea
cried
mollie
betty
i
a
good
notion
to
hush
cautioned
betty
placing
a
hand
on
the
arm
of
her
impetuous
chum
do
say
anything
it
will
only
make
matters
worse
they
are
trying
to
provoke
us
kittie
and
alice
walked
off
their
arms
about
each
other
waist
laughing
heartily
at
something
in
which
they
seemed
to
find
a
good
joke
let
us
finish
the
game
suggested
betty
quietly
to
grace
and
they
did
i
do
see
how
they
could
be
so
bold
as
to
ask
us
murmured
mollie
it
was
one
afternoon
a
few
days
before
the
close
of
school
for
the
term
which
also
would
mark
the
start
of
the
outdoor
girls
on
their
tramping
tour
that
as
she
was
packing
her
books
to
leave
her
desk
for
the
day
betty
saw
a
note
fall
out
of
her
latin
grammar
that
strange
she
murmured
half
aloud
i
wonder
who
could
have
put
that
there
who
is
it
from
i
wonder
as
if
you
did
know
laughed
amy
coming
up
behind
her
friend
they
were
alone
in
the
classroom
for
the
moment
why
what
do
you
mean
asked
betty
blushing
slightly
i
think
i
saw
will
give
grace
a
note
this
noon
went
on
amy
ah
secrets
and
does
it
happen
that
will
and
allen
washburn
are
quite
chummy
if
the
initials
are
on
that
note
betty
of
course
they
not
the
idea
allen
washburn
need
think
oh
i
know
he
need
send
notes
to
you
this
way
but
perhaps
will
forgot
to
deliver
it
and
grace
just
slipped
it
into
your
book
intending
to
tell
you
of
it
ah
betty
silly
it
is
that
at
all
see
i
let
you
read
the
note
hastily
betty
unfolded
it
there
was
but
a
single
unsigned
sheet
of
paper
and
scrawled
on
it
were
these
words
before
you
go
camping
and
tramping
ask
amy
stonington
who
her
father
and
mother
are
chapter
v
amy
mystery
betty
was
quick
to
comprehend
the
cruel
words
and
in
an
instant
she
had
crumpled
the
anonymous
scrawl
in
her
hand
but
she
was
the
fraction
of
a
second
too
late
amy
had
read
it
betty
heard
the
sound
of
amy
sigh
and
then
the
catch
in
her
breath
she
turned
quickly
amy
cried
betty
did
you
see
it
oh
my
dear
the
meanness
of
it
the
awful
meanness
oh
amy
my
dear
and
she
put
her
arms
around
her
trembling
companion
oh
if
i
only
knew
who
sent
it
i
i
can
guess
faltered
amy
who
alice
jallow
the
the
cat
betty
simply
could
not
help
saying
it
let
let
me
see
it
again
whispered
amy
i
did
mean
to
read
your
note
betty
but
i
saw
it
before
i
realized
it
my
note
it
is
mine
i
would
own
to
receiving
such
a
scrawl
oh
amy
i
so
sorry
never
mind
betty
i
i
been
expecting
it
you
have
yes
that
that
is
what
has
been
bothering
me
of
late
you
may
have
noticed
i
noticed
that
you
have
quite
been
yourself
amy
my
dear
but
i
never
suspected
and
you
think
alice
sent
this
i
almost
sure
of
it
it
has
to
be
known
sooner
or
later
but
do
say
anything
to
alice
why
not
the
idea
she
ought
to
be
exposed
and
punished
i
go
to
no
please
do
betty
it
it
is
true
and
and
there
is
no
use
giving
her
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
she
has
has
hurt
me
faltered
amy
oh
the
meanness
of
it
murmured
betty
but
amy
dear
i
understand
this
does
at
all
look
like
the
writing
of
alice
jallow
i
know
she
has
disguised
her
scribbling
that
all
but
it
matter
i
never
charge
her
with
it
why
not
i
have
the
heart
oh
betty
i
afraid
it
only
too
true
i
really
do
know
who
my
father
and
mother
are
amy
no
i
do
i
suspected
a
mystery
a
long
while
and
now
i
am
sure
i
am
mixed
up
in
one
amy
stonington
cried
betty
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
look
here
get
to
some
quiet
place
some
one
will
be
coming
in
here
we
can
go
to
miss
greene
room
she
has
gone
for
the
day
but
perhaps
you
do
want
to
tell
me
amy
oh
yes
i
do
i
want
to
tell
all
you
girls
and
then
maybe
amy
stonington
exclaimed
betty
if
you
going
to
hint
and
i
see
that
you
are
that
we
pay
any
attention
to
this
note
or
let
it
make
any
difference
between
us
even
if
it
true
which
i
believe
let
see
what
do
i
want
to
say
i
all
confused
oh
i
know
i
mean
that
it
sha
make
a
particle
of
difference
to
us
if
you
never
had
a
father
or
mother
oh
of
course
i
had
some
time
and
amy
smiled
through
a
mist
of
tears
only
there
a
mystery
about
them
what
became
of
them
why
i
thought
all
of
us
thought
that
and
stonington
were
your
parents
said
the
wondering
betty
so
did
i
until
lately
then
i
began
to
notice
that
papa
and
mamma
as
i
thought
them
were
frequently
consulting
together
they
always
stopped
talking
when
i
came
near
but
i
supposed
it
might
be
about
some
plans
they
had
for
sending
me
away
to
be
educated
in
music
so
i
pretended
not
to
notice
though
i
did
not
want
to
go
away
from
dear
deepdale
their
queer
consultations
increased
and
they
looked
at
me
so
strangely
that
finally
i
went
to
mamma
no
my
aunt
as
i
must
call
her
and
your
aunt
exclaimed
betty
yes
that
is
what
stonington
is
to
me
or
rather
she
was
poor
dear
mamma
aunt
i
am
going
to
call
her
aunt
however
and
stonington
uncle
they
wish
it
oh
then
they
have
told
you
yes
it
was
the
night
before
the
day
that
i
fainted
in
school
it
was
thinking
of
that
i
guess
that
unnerved
me
why
amy
a
mystery
about
you
yes
and
one
i
fear
will
never
be
found
out
i
tell
you
about
it
not
unless
you
rather
dear
and
betty
put
her
arms
about
her
chum
as
they
sat
on
the
worn
sofa
in
miss
greene
retiring
room
i
had
much
rather
i
want
you
and
grace
and
mollie
to
know
maybe
maybe
you
can
help
me
she
finished
with
a
bright
smile
you
see
it
was
this
way
of
course
i
do
remember
anything
about
it
all
my
recollections
are
centered
in
deepdale
and
about
and
stonington
it
is
the
only
home
i
have
ever
really
known
though
i
have
a
dim
recollection
of
having
as
a
child
been
in
some
other
place
but
that
is
like
a
dream
but
it
seems
that
when
i
was
a
very
little
girl
both
my
parents
lived
in
a
distant
city
then
one
day
there
was
a
terrible
storm
the
river
rose
and
there
was
a
flood
this
i
was
told
by
my
uncle
and
aunt
as
i
am
going
to
call
them
who
my
father
and
mother
were
i
never
knew
except
from
what
i
have
heard
but
it
seems
that
stonington
was
mamma
aunt
in
the
flood
our
house
was
washed
away
but
i
then
a
small
baby
was
found
floating
on
a
sort
of
raft
tied
to
a
mattress
on
a
bed
i
was
taken
to
a
farm
house
and
found
pinned
to
my
dress
was
an
envelope
just
an
envelope
yes
there
might
have
been
a
letter
in
it
but
if
there
was
it
had
been
washed
out
in
the
flood
and
rain
but
the
envelope
was
addressed
to
stonington
here
and
she
was
telegraphed
to
her
husband
hurried
on
for
he
knew
of
the
flood
and
feared
for
his
wife
relatives
who
lived
in
that
town
he
took
me
back
with
him
and
i
have
lived
with
uncle
john
and
aunt
sarah
ever
since
but
your
father
and
mother
amy
no
one
ever
knew
what
became
of
them
they
they
were
never
found
though
a
careful
search
was
made
i
was
the
only
one
left
and
was
there
nothing
to
tell
of
your
past
life
there
was
much
to
tell
you
see
i
was
so
small
there
was
a
sort
of
diary
in
the
bed
with
me
but
it
only
gave
details
of
my
baby
days
probably
it
was
written
by
my
mother
for
the
handwriting
is
that
of
a
woman
aunt
sarah
gave
it
to
me
the
other
day
i
shall
always
treasure
it
and
is
that
all
well
there
was
a
mention
of
something
in
a
vague
sort
of
way
that
i
was
to
inherit
when
i
grew
up
whether
it
was
land
or
money
no
one
can
tell
the
reference
is
so
veiled
even
uncle
john
and
he
is
a
stock
and
bond
broker
you
know
says
he
is
puzzled
he
has
had
a
search
made
in
rockford
that
where
the
flood
was
but
it
came
to
nothing
and
so
that
is
all
i
know
of
my
past
but
your
aunt
must
know
something
of
your
mother
if
they
were
relatives
very
little
they
saw
each
other
hardly
at
all
and
not
for
some
years
before
my
mother
marriage
aunt
sarah
says
how
my
parents
came
to
pin
the
stoningtons
address
on
my
baby
dress
they
can
only
guess
and
never
know
probably
they
did
it
before
they
were
were
drowned
then
your
name
is
stonington
after
all
amy
oh
yet
it
is
the
queer
part
of
it
is
that
my
mother
is
said
to
have
married
a
man
of
the
same
name
as
uncle
john
but
no
relative
as
far
as
we
can
learn
so
i
amy
stonington
just
the
same
my
uncle
and
aunt
formally
adopted
me
after
they
found
that
there
was
no
hope
of
locating
my
parents
and
so
i
lived
in
ignorance
of
the
mystery
about
me
until
just
the
other
day
and
then
they
told
you
yes
it
was
discussing
the
advisability
of
this
that
caused
uncle
john
and
aunt
sarah
to
confer
so
often
then
they
decided
that
i
was
getting
old
enough
to
be
told
they
said
they
would
rather
it
would
come
to
me
from
themselves
than
from
strangers
oh
then
others
know
of
it
yes
a
few
persons
in
town
but
they
were
good
enough
to
keep
it
quiet
for
my
sake
among
them
so
uncle
john
told
me
were
alice
people
that
is
why
i
think
she
wrote
the
note
she
must
have
found
out
about
my
secret
in
some
way
and
thought
to
taunt
me
with
it
the
mean
creature
oh
i
do
mind
i
was
only
afraid
you
girls
amy
stonington
if
you
even
hint
at
such
a
thing
again
we
never
forgive
you
as
if
we
cared
why
i
think
it
perfectly
wonderful
to
have
such
a
romance
about
you
i
know
the
other
girls
will
be
crazy
about
it
of
course
it
sad
too
dear
but
maybe
some
day
you
find
out
that
your
father
and
mother
are
are
gone
at
all
and
you
have
them
again
that
what
i
been
hoping
since
i
knew
but
there
is
very
little
chance
after
all
these
years
uncle
john
told
me
not
to
hope
you
see
they
must
have
been
drowned
the
worst
is
that
i
ca
recall
them
they
never
corresponded
with
aunt
and
uncle
in
years
i
do
know
what
sort
of
a
home
i
had
or
or
whether
i
had
brothers
or
sisters
no
i
suppose
there
is
much
chance
of
your
parents
having
escaped
the
flood
and
yet
i
read
in
books
oh
yes
in
books
but
this
is
real
life
betty
and
now
dear
told
you
all
i
know
as
i
said
it
shocked
me
when
i
first
heard
it
but
i
pretty
well
over
it
now
only
it
did
startle
me
when
i
read
that
note
over
your
shoulder
i
should
think
it
would
when
i
see
alice
please
do
say
anything
to
her
pleaded
amy
please
do
let
her
see
that
that
it
has
made
a
bit
of
difference
i
will
a
difference
why
we
love
you
all
the
more
amy
if
possible
that
good
of
you
now
shall
we
hark
some
one
is
coming
exclaimed
betty
tiptoeing
to
the
door
while
amy
shrank
back
on
the
sofa
chapter
vi
the
leaky
boat
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
and
then
the
relieved
voice
of
betty
was
heard
to
say
oh
it
grace
i
so
glad
i
thought
what
are
you
doing
here
asked
the
newcomer
it
was
evident
from
her
rather
mumbled
words
which
mumbling
i
have
been
unable
to
reproduce
in
cold
type
that
grace
was
eating
candy
have
some
chocolate
she
went
on
holding
out
a
bag
oh
grace
chocolate
at
such
a
time
as
this
rebuked
betty
her
mind
filled
with
the
story
she
had
just
heard
why
what
the
matter
with
the
time
amy
is
in
there
and
she
motioned
to
the
private
room
gracious
has
she
fainted
again
no
where
is
mollie
coming
there
she
is
we
were
looking
everywhere
for
you
alice
jallow
said
the
horrid
thing
burst
out
betty
why
whatever
can
have
happened
you
look
quite
tragic
i
am
come
in
here
grace
advanced
and
not
even
the
prospect
of
hearing
what
she
guessed
was
going
to
be
some
sort
of
a
strange
secret
could
stop
her
from
taking
another
helping
of
candy
betty
saw
and
murmured
you
are
hopeless
what
up
asked
mollie
gliding
into
the
room
her
dark
hair
straying
rather
rebelliously
from
beneath
her
hat
come
in
invited
betty
and
soon
the
four
were
sitting
together
while
in
a
sort
of
dialogue
betty
and
amy
told
the
pathetic
little
story
and
that
how
it
stands
finished
betty
i
wanted
to
do
something
or
say
something
to
make
alice
jallow
feel
she
should
be
punished
we
should
all
cut
her
she
ought
to
be
put
out
of
school
burst
out
the
impulsive
mollie
i
shall
go
to
miss
greene
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
billy
exclaimed
betty
as
she
detained
the
girl
who
had
already
started
from
the
room
amy
does
wish
it
besides
i
think
alice
will
be
sorry
enough
later
for
what
she
has
done
i
had
rather
you
would
go
to
her
spoke
amy
quietly
oh
well
of
course
began
mollie
i
do
wish
i
had
better
control
of
myself
she
added
rather
sadly
i
start
to
do
such
rash
things
indeed
you
do
my
dear
spoke
grace
but
we
know
you
do
mean
it
here
help
yourself
and
she
extended
the
candy
bag
i
could
i
do
feel
like
it
i
i
feel
all
choked
up
in
here
exclaimed
mollie
placing
her
hand
on
her
firm
white
throat
i
i
want
to
do
something
to
to
that
cat
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
that
what
i
called
her
said
betty
but
we
must
let
her
know
that
she
has
annoyed
us
sometimes
i
feel
real
sorry
for
alice
she
seems
rather
lonesome
i
suppose
the
story
will
be
all
over
school
soon
went
on
grace
i
sha
mind
spoke
amy
softly
well
i
glad
you
do
my
dear
remarked
betty
it
more
romantic
than
anything
else
after
you
get
over
the
sad
part
of
it
and
i
am
trying
to
do
that
said
amy
bravely
together
the
four
girls
came
out
of
the
school
most
of
the
other
pupils
had
gone
home
for
vacation
days
were
near
and
study
hours
were
shortened
on
account
of
examinations
there
she
is
now
said
mollie
as
they
turned
a
corner
who
questioned
betty
that
jallow
girl
and
her
familiar
kittie
her
name
is
too
good
for
her
do
notice
her
suggested
betty
and
do
for
goodness
sake
speak
to
them
we
do
want
a
scene
perhaps
alice
only
did
it
impulsively
and
did
not
really
mean
it
if
the
reputed
author
of
the
anonymous
letter
and
her
close
friend
hoped
for
any
demonstration
on
the
part
of
those
they
had
hoped
to
wound
they
were
disappointed
in
calm
unconsciousness
of
the
twain
the
quartette
passed
on
talking
gaily
though
it
was
a
bit
forced
of
their
coming
trip
and
i
must
do
alice
the
justice
to
say
that
later
she
was
truly
sorry
for
what
she
had
done
there
will
exclaimed
grace
as
she
caught
sight
of
her
brother
and
frank
haley
is
with
him
here
girls
take
what
left
of
these
chocolates
or
will
wo
leave
one
does
he
know
you
have
them
asked
amy
accepting
a
few
yes
he
saw
me
buying
them
oh
bother
there
comes
that
percy
falconer
and
he
has
a
new
suit
vanity
of
vanities
the
course
of
will
and
his
chum
as
well
as
that
of
the
faultless
dresser
as
he
hoped
he
appeared
brought
them
toward
the
girls
there
was
no
escape
and
the
little
throng
walked
onward
betty
kept
close
to
amy
for
she
knew
just
how
she
must
feel
after
the
disclosure
ah
good
afternoon
ladies
greeted
percy
wonderful
weather
having
my
word
beastly
beautiful
mocked
the
irrepressible
mollie
horribly
lovely
is
it
what
oh
i
say
now
began
percy
i
really
where
you
get
the
clothes
broke
in
will
they
a
london
importation
london
importation
my
eye
exclaimed
frank
why
cohen
emporium
on
main
street
has
the
same
thing
in
the
window
marked
thirteen
regular
fourteen
dollars
oh
i
say
now
quit
your
spoofing
give
us
some
candy
sis
begged
will
come
on
now
i
know
you
got
it
i
had
it
we
have
it
they
had
it
thou
hast
it
not
quoted
grace
with
a
laugh
nothing
doing
this
time
little
brother
of
mine
and
you
ate
all
those
chocolates
this
in
tones
we
not
i
corrected
his
sister
percy
falconer
after
vainly
trying
to
get
in
place
to
walk
beside
betty
who
frustrated
him
by
keeping
amy
close
to
her
drifted
off
to
find
new
sartorial
worlds
to
conquer
the
others
walked
on
the
boys
joining
in
the
talk
and
laughter
amy
seemed
to
have
recovered
her
spirits
and
the
girls
made
no
reference
to
the
little
tragedy
which
they
knew
would
soon
become
public
property
so
you
are
really
determined
to
go
off
on
that
walking
trip
asked
will
who
had
floated
back
to
join
mollie
we
certainly
are
why
do
you
think
we
can
do
it
perhaps
but
i
think
you
run
at
the
sight
of
the
first
tramp
or
cow
and
as
for
a
storm
good
night
thank
you
for
nothing
and
mollie
dark
eyes
had
little
of
fun
in
them
as
they
looked
into
those
of
will
ford
eventually
will
and
frank
left
them
and
the
girls
continued
on
until
they
reached
mollie
house
come
in
she
invited
i
know
they
baked
and
we
have
a
cup
of
tea
and
some
cake
it
will
refresh
us
i
ought
to
be
going
home
said
amy
with
a
little
hesitating
pause
at
the
word
home
oh
do
come
in
begged
the
french
girl
as
they
entered
the
yard
the
twins
hand
in
hand
and
came
down
the
walk
to
meet
them
oh
the
dears
gushed
grace
is
she
too
sweet
whispered
betty
as
she
caught
up
dodo
and
in
need
of
soap
and
water
as
usual
commented
mollie
drily
but
nanette
can
do
nothing
with
them
they
are
clean
one
minute
like
little
arabs
the
next
what
would
you
have
and
she
threw
herself
into
a
tragic
gesture
in
imitation
of
the
imported
french
maid
at
which
her
chums
laughed
have
you
a
kiss
for
me
paul
demanded
grace
of
the
little
fellow
when
she
had
replaced
his
sister
on
the
walk
dot
any
tandy
came
the
diplomatic
inquiry
listen
to
the
mercenary
little
wretch
cried
his
older
sister
paul
where
are
your
manners
has
oo
dot
any
tandy
came
in
inflexible
accents
i
might
find
just
a
morsel
if
you
kiss
me
first
stipulated
grace
tandy
fust
was
the
imperturbable
retort
i
like
tandy
dodo
like
tandy
we
bofe
like
tandy
the
sum
total
of
childish
happiness
laughed
betty
do
grace
if
you
have
any
left
relieve
this
suspense
some
candy
was
forthcoming
and
then
with
more
of
it
spread
on
their
faces
than
had
entered
their
chubby
mouths
the
twins
toddled
off
content
girls
what
do
you
say
to
a
little
row
on
the
river
asked
mollie
when
they
had
been
refreshed
by
cakes
and
tea
my
boat
will
hold
us
all
and
we
can
float
down
and
talk
of
our
coming
trip
float
down
and
back
remarked
grace
with
emphasis
the
exercise
will
do
you
good
we
must
get
in
training
i
believe
the
proper
word
is
in
training
for
our
hike
hike
queried
betty
suffragist
lingo
for
walk
explained
mollie
come
on
the
argono
river
ran
but
a
short
distance
from
mollie
home
and
soon
the
four
girls
were
in
an
but
safely
constructed
barge
half
drifting
and
half
rowing
down
the
picturesque
stream
the
afternoon
sun
was
waning
behind
a
bank
of
clouds
screened
from
the
girls
by
a
fringe
of
trees
and
as
they
floated
on
they
talked
at
intervals
of
amy
secret
and
of
the
coming
fun
they
expected
to
have
let
get
farther
out
in
the
middle
suggested
betty
when
they
came
to
a
wide
part
of
the
river
it
more
pleasant
there
and
the
air
is
fresher
it
is
very
warm
yes
i
think
we
will
have
another
storm
agreed
grace
if
it
rains
now
it
is
so
likely
to
when
we
start
she
was
pulling
on
one
pair
of
oars
and
mollie
on
a
second
the
others
relieving
them
occasionally
soon
the
boat
was
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
they
had
gone
on
for
perhaps
half
a
mile
when
betty
who
was
sitting
comfortably
in
the
stern
toying
with
the
rudder
ropes
uttered
an
exclamation
oh
she
cried
my
feet
are
wet
mollie
the
boat
is
leaking
leaking
yes
see
the
water
is
fairly
pouring
in
mollie
made
a
hasty
examination
under
the
bottom
boards
of
her
craft
girls
she
cried
in
tragic
tones
there
a
hole
in
the
boat
do
say
that
begged
amy
standing
up
sit
down
sternly
ordered
betty
there
is
no
danger
sit
down
or
you
fall
overboard
oh
but
see
the
water
cried
the
nervous
amy
it
is
coming
in
faster
and
indeed
it
was
it
is
those
twins
declared
mollie
i
told
them
not
to
get
in
my
boat
but
they
must
have
and
they
loosened
the
drain
plug
so
that
it
came
out
a
moment
ago
quick
see
if
you
can
find
it
there
was
a
frightened
search
for
the
plug
that
fitted
in
a
hole
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
through
which
aperture
the
water
could
be
drained
out
when
the
craft
was
on
shore
it
is
here
cried
grace
oh
mollie
keep
quiet
it
must
be
here
insisted
the
owner
of
the
boat
it
could
get
out
look
for
it
find
it
or
if
you
ca
we
stuff
a
handkerchief
in
the
hole
meanwhile
the
water
continued
to
pour
in
through
the
bottom
of
the
boat
setting
the
boards
afloat
and
thoroughly
wetting
the
skirts
of
the
girls
and
they
were
now
in
the
centre
of
the
widest
part
of
the
river
chapter
vii
to
the
rescue
rapidly
the
water
rose
in
the
boat
it
had
now
set
the
bottom
boards
more
fully
afloat
and
the
girls
in
vain
tried
to
raise
their
feet
out
of
the
incoming
flood
they
stared
at
the
swirling
water
fascinated
for
the
moment
girls
we
simply
must
do
something
cried
betty
usually
the
one
to
take
the
initiative
row
ashore
row
ashore
begged
amy
it
so
deep
out
here
it
is
much
shallower
near
shore
remarked
mollie
what
can
have
become
of
that
plug
and
pulling
in
her
oars
she
began
feeling
about
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
moving
her
hand
around
under
the
water
maybe
the
twins
took
it
to
make
a
cat
cradle
with
suggested
grace
no
it
could
have
been
out
when
we
started
or
the
water
would
have
come
in
at
once
said
mollie
it
has
come
out
only
a
few
minutes
ago
we
simply
must
find
it
row
ashore
row
ashore
insisted
amy
betty
had
swung
the
boat
head
around
but
the
craft
was
now
badly
and
did
not
move
quickly
the
current
of
the
river
was
carrying
them
down
the
stream
oh
girls
cried
amy
her
voice
trembling
somewhat
getting
deeper
it
certainly
is
stopping
from
coming
in
murmured
mollie
where
that
plug
desperately
she
continued
to
feel
about
while
the
other
girls
cast
anxious
eyes
toward
the
shore
that
now
seemed
so
far
away
and
there
not
another
boat
in
sight
exclaimed
betty
we
must
call
for
help
i
have
it
i
have
the
plug
suddenly
cried
mollie
pulling
on
something
ouch
that
my
foot
my
toe
cried
grace
let
go
oh
dear
sighed
betty
in
disappointed
tones
i
thought
i
had
it
said
mollie
wait
until
i
catch
those
twins
we
we
never
may
see
them
again
faltered
amy
whose
recent
rather
tragic
experience
had
gotten
on
her
nerves
stop
that
commanded
betty
a
bit
sharply
oh
how
fast
the
water
is
coming
in
moaned
grace
i
going
to
faint
i
know
i
going
to
faint
do
you
dare
cried
mollie
quickly
if
you
do
i
never
speak
to
you
again
there
take
that
she
reached
over
on
the
seat
beside
grace
caught
up
a
chocolate
from
a
bag
and
thrust
the
confection
into
the
tall
girl
mouth
that
will
keep
you
from
saying
such
silly
things
and
also
from
fainting
remarked
mollie
practically
now
girls
since
we
find
that
plug
we
got
to
do
the
next
best
thing
if
we
could
only
whittle
one
said
betty
if
we
had
a
knife
we
might
cut
a
piece
off
one
of
the
oars
or
the
side
of
the
boat
went
on
mollie
but
as
we
have
we
ca
we
must
arrange
to
take
knives
with
us
on
our
tour
though
it
no
time
to
talk
about
tours
now
moaned
amy
we
we
never
get
ashore
nonsense
cried
betty
we
got
to
if
we
ca
find
a
plug
or
make
one
we
have
to
stuff
something
in
the
hole
girls
your
handkerchiefs
she
seemed
to
have
a
sudden
inspiration
she
began
rolling
hers
into
a
sort
of
cylindrical
shape
as
she
spoke
the
other
girls
saw
her
idea
and
passed
over
their
tiny
squares
of
linen
which
betty
rolled
with
her
own
that
one
of
my
best
ones
sighed
grace
as
she
parted
with
hers
i
got
it
on
my
birthday
it
in
a
good
cause
never
mind
remarked
betty
firmly
and
get
it
back
you
know
when
we
get
ashore
if
we
ever
get
ashore
you
mean
spoke
amy
stop
it
commanded
the
little
captain
sharply
of
course
we
get
ashore
now
billy
where
is
that
hole
wherever
the
water
seems
to
be
coming
in
fastest
replied
the
owner
of
the
boat
oh
be
quick
betty
we
ca
float
much
longer
well
we
can
swim
coolly
replied
betty
as
she
began
feeling
about
for
the
hole
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
meanwhile
she
looked
closely
at
the
surface
of
the
water
in
the
craft
which
had
now
risen
until
it
was
close
to
the
under
side
of
the
seats
the
girls
were
quite
wet
the
boat
was
harder
than
ever
to
row
that
plug
ought
to
be
floating
somewhere
hereabouts
she
murmured
it
probably
caught
in
a
crack
or
under
one
of
the
seats
said
mollie
hurry
up
betty
the
hole
is
right
near
where
you
were
feeling
that
time
yes
you
can
see
the
water
bubbling
up
added
amy
oh
do
hurry
or
we
sink
well
then
we
can
swim
said
betty
coolly
it
a
good
thing
we
all
know
how
but
in
our
clothes
protested
amy
oh
i
guess
we
can
do
it
if
we
try
went
on
betty
there
i
have
the
handkerchiefs
in
the
hole
she
exclaimed
as
she
forced
the
linens
into
the
aperture
now
let
row
harder
oh
but
i
soaked
sighed
grace
indeed
they
were
all
in
no
very
comfortable
plight
they
succeeded
in
heading
the
boat
for
shore
but
they
had
only
rowed
a
short
distance
when
grace
cried
the
water
is
still
coming
in
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
they
all
stared
at
the
place
where
under
water
betty
had
thrust
in
the
handkerchiefs
there
was
a
string
of
small
bubbles
showing
that
the
river
water
was
still
finding
its
way
into
the
boat
help
help
help
suddenly
called
amy
why
what
the
matter
demanded
betty
in
alarm
oh
there
someone
on
shore
near
a
boat
it
a
man
or
a
boy
he
must
come
out
and
rescue
us
said
amy
and
there
was
a
trace
of
tears
in
her
voice
what
the
matter
came
the
hail
from
the
one
on
shore
we
sinking
called
betty
making
a
megaphone
of
her
hands
come
out
and
save
us
all
right
and
then
the
following
words
were
lost
as
the
wind
carried
them
aside
the
youth
on
shore
the
girls
could
now
see
that
he
was
a
youth
began
shoving
out
a
boat
he
did
not
seem
very
adept
in
the
knowledge
of
rowing
and
took
quite
a
little
time
to
get
under
way
oh
it
that
percy
falconer
cried
betty
he
never
get
to
us
girls
i
guess
we
have
to
swim
for
it
after
all
look
there
comes
someone
else
suddenly
cried
amy
oh
grace
your
brother
will
thank
goodness
for
that
murmured
betty
now
we
have
some
chance
if
he
can
only
make
percy
listen
to
reason
and
put
back
for
him
they
seem
to
be
having
some
argument
said
grace
oh
if
that
percy
is
the
she
did
not
finish
for
they
were
all
vitally
interested
in
what
was
taking
place
on
shore
will
and
percy
seemed
to
be
having
a
difference
of
opinion
and
it
appeared
that
percy
wanted
to
shine
as
a
lone
hero
in
the
rescue
that
must
be
performed
quickly
now
if
it
was
to
be
performed
at
all
come
back
with
that
boat
will
could
be
heard
to
cry
you
do
know
how
to
row
i
do
so
retorted
percy
the
wind
now
carrying
the
words
to
the
girls
come
back
here
insisted
will
firmly
or
i
we
be
too
late
almost
whined
percy
they
said
they
were
sinking
come
back
here
fairly
shouted
will
i
can
row
twice
as
fast
as
you
and
we
make
better
time
even
if
you
do
put
back
come
on
or
i
jump
in
and
swim
out
to
you
and
chuck
you
overboard
come
back
this
argument
proved
effective
possibly
percy
was
thinking
what
would
happen
to
his
clothes
if
will
put
his
threat
into
execution
at
any
rate
he
swung
the
big
boat
around
and
a
few
moments
later
will
and
he
the
former
pulling
vigorously
on
the
oars
were
on
their
way
to
rescue
the
now
thoroughly
frightened
girls
chapter
viii
closing
days
oh
will
do
hurry
my
dress
will
be
ruined
thus
called
grace
as
she
frantically
waved
to
her
brother
to
hasten
his
stroke
huh
he
panted
dress
a
nice
time
to
think
of
dresses
when
they
almost
sinking
are
they
do
you
think
they
sink
and
be
drowned
faltered
percy
they
may
sink
they
not
very
likely
to
be
drowned
though
grunted
will
as
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
to
get
his
course
straight
they
can
all
swim
pull
on
your
left
more
we
pass
if
you
do
sink
i
ca
i
ca
swim
oh
dear
cried
percy
i
know
it
that
why
i
wanted
you
to
come
back
and
get
me
you
look
nice
rescuing
four
girls
all
alone
said
will
and
you
not
able
to
swim
a
stroke
i
could
do
it
protested
percy
in
maybe
agreed
will
anyhow
it
lucky
i
happened
to
come
along
and
it
a
good
thing
i
heard
them
hollering
and
got
the
boat
ready
said
the
lad
whose
attire
was
now
rather
disheveled
from
the
haste
of
rowing
that
right
percy
i
give
you
credit
for
that
oh
do
hurry
boys
cried
mollie
we
be
under
in
another
minute
coming
cried
will
pull
harder
percy
i
ca
you
got
to
that
seemed
to
be
all
there
was
to
it
percy
pulled
harder
only
just
in
time
did
will
and
his
companion
reach
the
boat
that
was
on
the
verge
of
sinking
and
only
the
skill
and
good
sense
of
the
girls
and
the
knowledge
that
they
could
swim
if
they
happened
to
fall
into
the
water
enabled
the
rescue
to
be
made
for
it
was
no
easy
task
to
disembark
from
one
craft
to
the
other
especially
with
one
nearly
submerged
but
while
will
and
percy
held
the
gunwale
of
their
boat
close
to
that
of
the
one
the
girls
carefully
crawled
out
and
soon
rather
wet
considerably
dismayed
but
withal
calmer
than
might
have
been
expected
the
quartette
was
safe
in
the
larger
craft
oh
what
a
relief
exclaimed
mollie
wringing
some
water
from
the
bottom
of
her
skirt
but
look
at
my
dress
and
this
is
only
the
second
time
i
worn
it
cried
grace
in
distress
it
will
be
ruined
all
it
needs
is
pressing
said
will
disdainfully
what
do
you
think
this
is
a
pair
of
your
trousers
demanded
his
sister
indignantly
pressing
it
is
ruined
we
all
drenched
spoke
amy
but
it
does
matter
as
long
as
we
safe
that
the
way
to
look
at
it
exclaimed
will
how
did
it
happen
anyhow
plug
out
of
the
bottom
explained
mollie
sententiously
the
twins
i
see
say
she
going
down
all
right
this
will
remarked
as
the
boat
from
which
the
girls
had
climbed
settled
lower
and
lower
in
the
water
oh
ca
we
save
it
cried
mollie
my
poor
boat
i
use
one
of
the
oars
as
a
buoy
said
will
i
fasten
it
to
the
painter
it
will
probably
drift
but
it
will
run
into
the
eddy
at
the
point
and
we
can
get
it
quickly
he
knotted
the
end
of
the
painter
about
one
of
the
oars
then
taking
the
others
into
the
craft
that
percy
had
commandeered
for
the
occasion
the
two
boys
rowed
the
girls
back
to
the
dock
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
that
led
to
mollie
house
come
in
girls
she
invited
we
can
get
dry
and
will
can
go
for
some
decent
things
for
you
three
i
go
too
exclaimed
percy
eagerly
and
for
once
the
girls
were
glad
of
his
services
up
the
walk
went
the
four
bedraggled
ones
the
twins
saw
them
coming
and
and
solemn
came
down
to
meet
them
oo
wet
remarked
dodo
drefful
wet
echoed
paul
yes

naughty
children
scolded
mollie
why
did
you
take
the
plug
the
wooden
peg
out
of
sister
boat
why
did
you
do
it
dodo

it
remarked
paul
with
the
ancient
privilege
of
the
accusing
man
dodo
want
to
make
a
doll
oo

me
came
from
the
little
girl
oo

but

back
asserted
paul
yes
but
it
came
out
and
sister
and
her
friends
were
nearly
drowned

naughty
children
very
naughty

dodo
fixing
her
big
eyes
on
grace
candy
good
land

the
idea
we
tandy
added
paul
then
out
came
billette
startled
at
the
sight
of
the
dripping
figures
oh
did
you
fall
in
she
asked
with
a
tragic
gesture
no
we
fell
out
said
her
daughter
laughing
it
all
right
momsey
but
we
must
get
dry
girls
give
will
and
percy
your
orders
perhaps
we
had
better
telephone
suggested
betty
oh
yes
chorused
the
others
soon
the
desired
garments
had
been
specified
and
the
boys
promised
to
bring
them
in
suitcases
as
soon
as
might
be
then
the
drenched
ones
made
themselves
comfortable
in
mollie
home
and
while
waiting
talked
over
the
accident
that
it
had
not
resulted
more
seriously
was
due
to
a
combination
of
circumstances
for
once
percy
was
really
useful
commented
amy
kindly
yes
but
we
never
hear
the
last
of
it
declared
grace
think
we
are
his
eternal
debtors
from
now
on
oh
here
comes
will
i
so
glad
soon
clothed
and
if
not
exactly
in
their
right
minds
at
least
on
the
verge
of
getting
there
the
four
came
out
to
thank
the
boys
and
there
was
more
talk
of
the
occurrence
i
hope
nothing
like
this
happens
when
we
set
off
on
our
tour
said
amy
it
wo
be
so
comfortable
then
to
be
drenched
do
speak
of
it
my
dear
begged
betty
the
little
happening
not
so
little
either
when
one
considers
the
possibility
had
one
good
effect
it
had
raised
amy
out
of
the
slough
of
despond
into
which
she
had
unwittingly
strayed
or
been
thrust
i
shall
pass
rapidly
over
the
next
few
days
for
nothing
of
moment
happened
i
say
nothing
of
moment
and
yet
there
was
for
the
story
of
the
mystery
concerning
amy
parentage
became
generally
known
as
might
have
been
expected
there
were
curious
glances
cast
at
amy
and
more
than
one
indiscreet
girl
tried
to
draw
her
out
about
the
matter
this
made
it
hard
for
amy
and
she
was
so
upset
about
it
that
stonington
kept
her
home
from
school
for
two
days
then
chiefly
by
reason
of
the
sensible
attitude
of
betty
grace
and
mollie
there
came
a
more
rational
feeling
and
it
was
agreed
that
the
affair
was
not
so
uncommon
after
all
the
chums
of
amy
said
nothing
about
the
letter
alice
had
written
that
she
had
was
very
evident
from
her
actions
for
she
was
at
first
defiant
and
then
contrite
and
several
times
it
was
seen
that
she
had
been
crying
but
she
said
nothing
perhaps
being
too
proud
to
admit
her
fault
we
just
treat
her
as
if
nothing
had
happened
said
betty
and
this
advice
was
followed
alice
was
not
generally
liked
but
the
three
chums
were
so
pleasant
to
her
in
contrast
with
the
conduct
of
the
other
girls
that
it
must
have
been
as
coals
of
fire
on
her
head
mollie
boat
was
easily
recovered
and
the
handkerchiefs
that
had
been
stuffed
in
the
hole
were
of
some
service
afterward
though
rather
stained
by
river
water
the
missing
plug
was
found
fast
under
a
seat
brace
which
accounted
for
it
not
floating
as
for
the
bill
nothing
was
heard
of
the
owner
and
it
with
the
attached
paper
remained
in
nelson
safe
the
advertisement
about
it
was
published
again
and
though
there
were
several
inquiries
from
persons
who
had
lost
money
they
could
lay
no
claim
to
this
particular
bankbill
we
just
have
to
wait
to
solve
that
mystery
said
grace
maybe
until
after
we
come
back
from
our
tour
arrangements
to
start
on
the
journey
had
rapidly
been
completed
betty
had
made
out
the
schedule
we
leave
deepdale
early
in
the
morning
she
said
and
go
on
to
rockford
there
we
due
to
stop
with
my
aunt
we
can
take
lunch
wherever
we
find
it
most
convenient
but
we
make
rockford
at
dusk
i
hope
i
certainly
trust
so
said
mollie
a
night
on
a
country
road
never
my
dear
the
next
night
we
stop
in
middleville
went
on
betty
at
cousin
house
from
there
to
broxton
where
grace
married
sister
will
put
us
up
and
then
in
turn
to
simpson
corners
that
my
uncle
you
know
to
flatbush
where
grace
mother
niece
has
kindly
consented
to
receive
us
on
to
hightown
that
mollie
aunt
place
to
cameron
that
where
we
go
to
the
camp
that
runs
she
paused
to
make
a
note
and
to
glance
over
the
schedule
to
make
sure
of
some
points
then
we
go
to
judgville
where
my
cousin

your

objections

upset
on
hearing
of
the
mystery
that
they
did
want
me
to
go
but
i
over
that
now
bravely
over
it
murmured
betty
as
she
put
her
arms
about
her
shoulders
the
examinations
were
on
and
boys
and
girls
were
working
hard
for
because
of
the
need
of
some
repairs
to
the
school
it
had
been
decided
to
cut
the
summer
term
short
then
came
the
closing
days
with
the
flowers
the
simple
exercises
and
the
farewell
to
the
graduating
class
of
which
our
girls
were
not
members
two
days
more
and

and
substantial
walking
boots
of
her
companions
but
they
did

my
size

she
appealed

the
others

frank
spoke

up
with
his
chum

an
hour

betty

the
front
yard
of
whose
house

mollie
i

and
she
leaned
against
patient
amy
for
support
we
go
part
way
with
you
offered

exclaimed
his
sister

earnestly

urged
grace
do

cried
betty
well
here
comes
allen
washburn
anyhow
went
on
the
tall
girl
at
least
we
have
enough
escorts
betty
blushed
and
hurried
into
the
house
on
some
pretense
or
other
the
girls
were
to
travel
light
taking
with
them
only
a
few
articles
of
clothing
their
suitcases
they
had
arranged
to
send
on
ahead
so
that
they
would
be
at
each
stopping
place
in
the
evening
when
the
little
party
arrived
then
on
leaving
in
the
morning
the
satchels
would
again
be
dispatched
in
advance
near
the
end
of
the
route
trunks
would
await
them
the
girls
expected
to
get
their
dinners
wherever
it
was
most
convenient
and
betty
had
drawn
up
a
sort
of
schedule
that
should
they
be
able
to
keep
up
to
it
would
mean
comfort
at
noon
as
i
have
explained
the
breakfasts
and
suppers
would
be
eaten
at
the
homes
of
friends
or
relatives
the
girls
had
a
little
alcohol
stove
a
teapot
and
saucepan
and
they
expected
under
favorable
circumstances
to
stop
by
the
roadside
and
brew
a
cup
of
tea
each
girl
carrying
an
aluminum
cup
and
saucer
evaporated
cream
and
sugar
to
be
replenished
from
time
to
time
formed
part
of
their
stores
sandwiches
to
be
procured
as
needed
would
form
a
staple
food
the
day
was
a
perfect
one
for
june
clad
in
their
new
suits
of
olive
drab
purposely
designed
for
walking
with
sensible
blouses
containing
pockets
with
skirts
sufficiently
short
stout
boots
and
natty
little
caps
the
outdoor
girls
looked
their
name
already
there
was
the
hint
of
tan
on
their
faces
for
they
had
been
much
in
the
open
of
late
they
had
assembled
at
betty
house
for
the
start
and
were
about
ready
to
leave
though
there
seemed
to
be
much
confusion
at
the
last
minute
their
first
stopping
place
at
least
for
the
night
would
be
the
town
of
rockford
about
sixteen
miles
away
where
betty
aunt
lived
they
expected
to
remain
two
nights
there
using
the
second
day
to
walk
to
a
certain
old
historic
mill
that
was
said
to
be
worthy
of
a
visit
the
were
said
over
and
over
again
it
seemed
and
a
number
of
friends
called
to
wish
the
girls
good
luck
betty
who
had
been
voted
into
the
place
of
leader
looked
over
her
small
command
what
it
lacked
in
numbers
it
made
up
in
attractiveness
for
certainly
no
prettier
picture
could
have
been
viewed
than
the
one
the
girls
presented
that
june
morning
beneath
the
trees
in
the
big
yard
well
are
we
ready
finally
asked
betty
as
ready
as
we
ever
shall
be
replied
grace
then
what
shall
i
say
forward
march
just
say
hike
cried
the
irrepressible
will
do
mind
him
cautioned
his
sister
oh
i
left
my
handkerchief
in
your
house
betty
and
she
hastened
to
secure
it
but
finally
after
a
few
more
forgotten
articles
had
been
collected
the
girls
were
ready
to
start
nelson
came
out
to
wave
a
farewell
and
his
wife
appeared
to
add
more
to
her
already
numerous
cautions
what
shall
i
do
with
that
five
hundred
dollar
bill
asked
father
if
the
owner
comes
shall
i
give
it
up
do
you
dare
she
cried
at
least
not
until
we
girls
have
a
chance
to
see
him
we
want
to
find
out
about
the
romance
back
of
it
write
to
us
if
it
claimed
all
right
i
will
he
said
with
a
laugh
but
it
does
seem
as
though
after
this
lapse
of
time
that
it
would
be
called
for
this
was
echoed
and
then
the
four
members
of
the
camping
and
tramping
club
started
down
the
pleasant
country
road
whereon
the
june
sun
shone
in
golden
patches
through
the
leafy
branches
of
the
trees
a
good
omen
breathed
amy
who
walked
beside
betty
will
frank
and
allen
brought
up
the
rear
carrying
the
small
valises
or
suitcases
the
girls
had
packed
the
little
cavalcade
passed
house
billette
appearing
at
the
window
to
wave
another
farewell
the
twins
were
not
in
sight
for
which
i
am
thankful
they
cry
to
come
said
their
sister
and
they
are
dreadful
teases
as
the
girls
and
their
escorts
swung
around
a
turn
in
the
highway
a
little
later
about
a
mile
from
mollie
house
grace
looked
back
to
cry
out
in
almost
tragic
accents
look
the
twins
they
following
us
and
the
others
turned
around
to
see
dodo
and
paul
hand
in
hand
trudging
bravely
and
determinedly
after
them
chapter
x
on
the
wrong
road
molly
for
a
moment
looked
as
if
she
wanted
to
cry
from
sheer
vexation
for
the
getting
ready
to
start
had
been
trying
on
all
of
them
then
the
humor
of
the
situation
appealed
to
her
and
she
exclaimed
as
the
twins
drew
nearer
dodo
paul
what
does
this
mean
go
back
home
at
once
mamma
will
be
dreadfully
worried
about
you
go
back
we
tum
too
lisped
dodo
we
go
for
walk
wit
oo
mollie
paul
added
the
little
dears
murmured
amy
you
would
say
so
if
you
had
to
go
all
the
way
back
with
them
exclaimed
the
sister
dodo
paul
you
must
go
home
at
once
dot
any
tandy
asked
dodo
seeing
doubtless
a
chance
to
make
capital
out
of
the
escapade
candy
the
idea
we
go
back
if
oo
dot
tandy
spoke
paul
cunningly
seeing
the
drift
of
his
small
sister
scheme
we
tandy
i
give
them
some
if
they
promise
to
go
back
spoke
grace
making
a
motion
toward
her
little
case
that
frank
carried
no
they
must
not
be
bribed
said
mollie
firmly
i
shall
insist
on
their
going
back
and
oh
what
faces
they
have
they
must
have
been
eating
candy
already
this
morning
our
tandy
all
gone
spoke
dodo
oo
dive
us
tandy
we
go
back
wo
us
paul
and
confidingly
she
looked
up
into
her
brother
face
we
go
for
tandy
he
affirmed
and
there
was
an
air
of
determination
about
him
that
boded
no
good
for
the
girls
you
must
go
back
declared
mollie
we
go
for
walk
said
dodo
tum
on
paul
we
dot
fings
to
eat
same
as
dem
and
proudly
she
displayed
a
very
dirty
bag
the
opening
of
which
disclosed
a
rather
jumbled
collection
of
bread
and
butter
and
cookie
crumbs
an
i
dot
a
gun
to
shoot
bad
bears
went
on
paul
shouldering
a
wooden
article
that
by
a
wide
stretch
of
the
imagination
could
be
seen
to
somewhat
resemble
a
musket
gun
go
explained
the
little
chap
bad
bears
run
off
turn
on
dodo
we
go
wif
and
he
nodded
at
the
hikers
as
will
unfeelingly
characterized
his
sister
and
her
chums
go
back
go
back
cried
mollie
now
again
on
the
verge
of
tears
oh
you
bad
children
what
shall
i
do
mamma
will
be
dreadfully
worried
and
if
we
take
them
back
we
lose
a
lot
of
time
what
shall
we
do
girls
we
go
back
for
tandy
lots
of
tandy
spoke
the
inexorable
dodo
we
tandy
do
us
paul
yes
said
paul
simply
the
easiest
way
out
of
it
is
to
give
them
some
candy
said
grace
in
a
low
voice
but
low
as
it
was
the
twins
heard
their
eyes
brightened
at
once
and
they
came
eagerly
forward
oh
dear
i
suppose
it
is
the
only
thing
to
do
affirmed
mollie
will
you
go
straight
back
if
you
get
some
candy
she
asked
straight
home
to
mamma
ess
we
bofe
go
promised
dodo
who
usually
led
her
small
brother
we
tandy
she
reiterated
me
tan
shoot
bears
said
paul
philosophically
where
is
tandy
with
him
evidently
the
prospect
of
present
enjoyment
was
preferable
to
the
future
possibility
of
becoming
a
great
hunter
here
you
are
cried
grace
as
she
took
out
some
chocolates
now
be
good
children
do
you
think
it
safe
for
them
to
go
back
alone
mollie
that
so
i
never
considered
that
i
wonder
if
we
have
to
go
with
them
oh
is
this
annoying
and
we
behind
time
now
we
never
get
to
rockford
what
shall
i
do
we
take
back
if
oo
dive
us
some
tandy
mocked
will
who
with
his
chums
had
been
an
interested
observer
of
the
little
scene
smarty
exclaimed
his
sister
but
i
take
you
at
your
word
just
the
same
here
frank
allen
you
see
that
he
performs
his
part
of
the
contract
and
she
held
the
candy
box
out
to
the
other
two
who
laughingly
accepted
the
bribe
then
with
the
hands
of
the
trusting
and
now
contented
twins
in
theirs
will
and
frank
bade
the
girls
and
led
away
the
two
small
ones
on
their
homeward
way
allen
following
them
after
a
farewell
to
betty
at
last
we
are
off
murmured
mollie
i
so
sorry
it
happened
girls
why
the
idea
cried
betty
it
was
just
a
little
pleasant
episode
and
we
remember
it
all
day
and
laugh
but
it
may
make
us
late
suggested
mollie
anxiously
not
much
went
on
the
little
captain
it
was
your
fault
anyhow
we
can
just
walk
a
little
faster
to
make
up
for
it
that
is
if
grace
thinks
she
can
stand
it
oh
you
wo
find
me
complaining
declared
the
girl
whose
footwear
had
been
the
subject
of
comment
i
not
as
comfortable
as
you
perhaps
she
admitted
but
i
will
be
when
i
get
my
other
shoes
and
now
give
ourselves
up
to
the
enjoyments
of
the
way
and
day
oh
is
it
just
lovely
indeed
a
more
auspicious
start
barring
the
little
delay
caused
by
the
twins
could
not
have
been
provided
the
day
was
one
of
those
balmy
ones
in
june
when
it
is
neither
too
hot
nor
too
blowy
when
the
breeze
seems
fairly
laden
with
the
sweet
scent
of
flowers
and
the
lazy
hum
of
bees
mingles
with
the
call
of
birds
the
way
led
out
along
a
pleasant
country
road
which
for
some
distance
wound
in
and
out
among
great
maples
that
formed
a
leafy
shade
which
might
be
most
acceptable
later
in
the
day
since
there
was
the
promise
of
considerable
heat
at
noon
as
yet
it
was
early
a
prompt
enough
start
having
been
made
to
allow
of
an
easy
pace
along
the
road
for
betty
had
said
in
reviewing
the
procedure
to
be
followed
we
do
want
to
tire
ourselves
out
on
the
first
stage
of
our
trip
we
ought
to
begin
gradually
that
is
the
way
all
athletes
train
oh
then
we
are
going
to
be
athletes
asked
amy
walking
athletes
at
least
responded
the
leader
now
girls
if
any
of
you
feel
like
resting
at
any
time
do
hesitate
to
say
so
we
want
this
to
be
an
enjoyment
not
a
task
even
if
we
are
a
regular
club
so
perfect
was
the
day
and
in
such
good
spirits
were
the
girls
that
even
the
simplest
sights
and
happenings
along
the
highway
brought
forth
pleased
comments
the
sight
of
a
cow
placidly
chewing
her
cud
in
a
meadow
the
patient
creature
standing
amid
the
buttercups
was
a
picture
they
all
admired
mollie
carried
a
little
camera
and
insisted
on
snapping
the
bovine
though
the
other
girls
urged
her
to
save
some
films
with
which
to
take
their
own
pictures
but
that
cow
will
make
such
a
lovely
enlargement
said
mollie
like
an
artist
painting
bravely
they
marched
along
with
a
confident
swing
and
firm
tread
at
least
all
but
grace
trod
firmly
and
she
rather
favored
herself
on
account
of
her
high
heels
but
her
chums
were
good
enough
not
to
laugh
they
passed
farm
houses
in
the
kitchen
doors
of
which
appeared
the
women
and
girls
of
the
household
standing
with
sleeves
arms
akimbo
looking
with
no
small
wonder
at
the
four
travelers
there
were
comments
too
not
always
inaudible
i
wonder
what
they
selling
one
woman
asked
her
daughter
as
they
paused
in
their
work
of
washing
a
seemingly
innumerable
number
of
milk
pans
they
take
us
for
peddlers
said
amy
a
little
later
a
small
boy
who
had
been
playing
horse
in
front
of
his
house
scuttled
back
toward
the
kitchen
crying
out
ma
ma
come
an
see
the
suffragists
oh
mercy
exclaimed
betty
what
will
we
be
taken
for
next
but
it
was
fun
with
all
that
and
such
a
novelty
to
the
girls
that
they
wondered
why
they
had
not
before
thought
of
this
means
of
spending
part
of
their
vacation
the
sun
crept
higher
in
the
sky
and
the
warmth
of
the
golden
beams
increased
the
girls
were
thankful
now
for
any
shade
they
might
encounter
and
they
were
fortunate
in
that
their
way
still
lay
in
pleasant
places
they
came
to
a
little
brook
that
ran
under
the
road
and
not
far
from
it
a
roadside
spring
bubbled
up
their
collapsible
drinking
cups
came
in
useful
and
they
remained
for
a
little
while
in
the
shade
near
the
cool
spot
where
shall
we
eat
our
lunch
asked
grace
as
the
sun
approached
the
zenith
are
you
hungry
already
asked
amy
i
am
beginning
to
feel
the
pangs
admitted
the
tall
graceful
girl
then
you
ca
have
eaten
much
candy
commented
mollie
only
three
pieces
hurrah
grace
is
reforming
cheered
betty
that
fine
i
do
see
why
you
always
making
fun
of
me
grace
said
as
she
pouted
i
sure
you
are
all
just
as
fond
of
chocolate
as
i
am
never
mind
consoled
mollie
we
will
eat
soon
for
i
confess
to
having
an
appetite
on
my
own
account
deciding
to
eat
at
least
on
this
first
day
of
the
tramp
a
lunch
of
their
own
providing
rather
than
go
to
some
restaurant
country
hotel
or
stop
at
a
chance
farm
house
the
girls
had
brought
with
them
packages
of
food
and
the
alcohol
stove
for
a
cup
of
tea
or
some
chocolate
this
looks
to
be
a
perfect
place
for
our
picnic
said
betty
as
on
passing
a
farm
they
saw
the
unhitched
and
led
under
a
tree
to
partake
of
their
hay
and
oats
it
must
be
noon
by
that
sign
went
on
the
little
captain
confirming
her
guess
by
a
glance
at
her
watch
it
is
she
said
so
we
eat
here
and
she
indicated
a
little
grassy
knoll
under
a
great
oak
tree
at
the
side
of
the
road
there
the
most
beautiful
spring
of
water
here
too
went
on
grace
shall
we
make
tea
do
exclaimed
mollie
i
just
dying
for
a
good
hot
cup
but
not
too
strong
soon
they
had
merrily
gathered
about
the
greensward
table
on
which
paper
napkins
formed
the
cloth
the
sandwiches
were
set
out
with
a
bottle
of
olives
to
add
to
the
attractiveness
and
then
the
little
kettle
was
put
on
the
alcohol
stove
which
had
been
set
up
in
the
shelter
of
the
great
oak
massive
trunk
it
boiling
finally
announced
betty
hand
me
the
tea
ball
amy
my
dear
pouring
the
steaming
water
over
the
silver
tea
ball
betty
circulated
it
around
in
the
cup
until
one
fragrant
brew
was
made
she
passed
this
over
to
mollie
and
proceeded
to
make
another
it
delicious
cried
the
french
girl
as
she
tasted
it
cream
and
sugar
having
been
added
oh
is
this
just
lovely
perfect
murmured
grace
i
would
have
missed
this
for
anything
in
pure
enjoyment
they
reclined
on
the
grass
after
the
meal
and
then
as
betty
after
a
look
at
her
watch
warned
them
that
the
better
half
of
their
journey
still
lay
before
them
they
started
off
again
they
had
proceeded
a
mile
or
so
and
the
way
was
not
so
pleasant
now
for
the
road
was
sandy
when
they
came
to
a
fork
of
the
highway
a
bore
letters
that
could
scarcely
be
made
out
and
though
they
had
a
road
map
the
girls
were
not
quite
sure
which
way
to
take
to
get
to
rockford
they
were
debating
the
matter
alternately
consulting
the
map
and
the
when
a
farmer
drove
past
which
road
to
rockford
please
hailed
betty
th
left
he
exclaimed
sententiously
there
this
last
to
the
horses
not
to
the
girls
the
road
map
seems
to
say
the
road
to
the
right
murmured
betty
as
the
farmer
drove
that
way
himself
well
he
ought
to
know
insisted
grace
we
take
the
left
and
they
did
if
they
had
hoped
to
have
all
go
smoothly
on
this
their
first
day
of
tramping
the
girls
were
destined
to
disappointment
in
blissful
ignorance
they
trudged
on
talking
so
interestedly
that
they
never
thought
to
glance
at
the
of
which
they
passed
several
it
was
amy
who
discovered
the
error
they
had
made
or
rather
the
error
the
farmer
had
caused
them
to
make
again
coming
to
a
dividing
of
the
ways
they
saw
a
new
put
up
by
a
local
automobile
organization
eight
miles
to
hamptown
and
ten
to
denby
read
amy
girls
where
is
rockford
anxiously
they
stared
at
the
sign
it
does
seem
to
say
anything
about
rockford
murmured
grace
maybe
someone
has
moved
our
town
suggested
mollie
humorously
betty
looked
puzzled
annoyed
and
a
little
anxious
a
boy
came
along
whistling
and
beating
the
dust
of
the
road
with
a
long
switch
which
is
the
road
to
rockford
little
boy
asked
betty
huh
i
say
which
is
the
road
to
rockford
give
him
a
candy
if
you
have
any
left
grace
suggested
mollie
in
a
low
tone
are
you
folks
peddlin
candy
asked
the
boy
and
his
eyes
shone
no
but
we
have
some
answered
betty
we
want
to
get
to
rockford
you
five
miles
off
the
road
exclaimed
the
boy
with
a
grin
as
though
he
took
personal
delight
in
their
dilemma
you
come
the
wrong
way
huh
oh
dear
murmured
mollie
do
you
give
him
any
candy
grace
it
is
his
fault
that
we
went
wrong
spoke
betty
chapter
xi
the
barking
dog
disappointment
and
not
a
little
worriment
held
the
four
girls
silent
for
a
moment
then
betty
feeling
that
it
was
her
place
to
assume
the
leadership
said
are
you
sure
little
boy
a
man
told
us
at
the
last
dividing
of
the
roads
to
take
the
left
as
that
led
to
rockford
well
he
did
know
what
he
was
talking
about
asserted
the
little
chap
with
the
supreme
confidence
of
youth
to
get
to
rockford
got
to
go
back
all
that
distance
cried
grace
we
never
make
it
in
time
is
there
a
shorter
way
some
we
can
take
inquired
betty
who
got
the
candy
inquired
the
little
chap
evidently
thinking
that
he
had
already
earned
some
reward
here
said
grace
hopelessly
holding
out
an
almost
emptied
box
but
please
do
tell
us
we
lost
oh
you
ai
exactly
lost
exclaimed
the
urchin
with
a
grin
i
live
just
down
the
road
a
piece
and
it
only
a
mile
to
bakersville
that
a
good
town
they
got
a
movin
picture
show
there
i
went
onct
did
you
indeed
said
betty
but
we
ca
go
there
is
there
some
way
of
getting
to
rockford
without
going
all
the
way
back
to
the
fork
why
it
miles
and
miles
i
wish
i
had
that
man
here
who
directed
us
wrongly
exclaimed
mollie
with
a
flash
of
her
dark
eyes
i
i
make
him
get
a
carriage
and
drive
us
to
your
aunt
house
betty
that
would
not
be
revenge
enough
declared
grace
he
ought
to
be
made
to
buy
us
each
a
box
of
the
best
chocolates
nothing
like
making
the
punishment
fit
the
crime
murmured
betty
say
are
you
demanded
the
boy
who
had
stood
in
wonder
during
this
dialogue
the
girls
broke
into
peals
of
merry
laughter
that
in
a
measure
served
to
relieve
the
tension
on
their
nerves
now
do
please
tell
us
how
to
get
to
rockford
begged
mollie
when
they
had
quieted
down
we
must
be
there
well
you
kin
git
there
by
goin
on
a
mile
further
and
taking
the
main
road
that
goes
through
sayreville
said
the
boy
his
mouth
full
of
candy
would
that
be
nearer
than
going
back
to
where
we
made
the
mistake
betty
asked
yep
a
lot
nearer
come
on
i
show
you
as
far
as
i
goin
and
the
boy
started
off
as
though
the
task
or
shall
i
say
pleasure
of
leading
four
pretty
girls
was
an
occurrence
we
never
can
get
there
before
dark
declared
mollie
oh
yes
we
will
said
betty
hopefully
we
can
walk
faster
than
this
if
you
do
i
simply
give
up
wailed
grace
these
shoes
and
she
leaned
against
a
tree
and
to
the
eternal
credit
of
the
other
girls
be
it
said
that
they
did
not
remark
i
told
you
so
silently
and
unconcernedly
the
boy
led
them
on
finally
he
came
to
his
own
home
and
rather
ungallantly
did
not
offer
to
go
farther
you
jest
keep
on
for
about
half
a
mile
he
said
an
you
come
to
a
i
hope
it
is
too
cross
murmured
grace
with
a
grave
face
huh
the
boy
looked
at
her
wonderingly
i
mean
not
cross
enough
to
bite
she
went
on
you
turn
to
the
left
the
boy
continued
and
keep
straight
on
till
you
get
to
watson
corners
then
you
turn
to
the
right
keep
on
past
an
old
stone
church
turn
to
the
right
and
that
a
straight
road
to
rockford
he
looked
curiously
at
grace
as
though
in
doubt
as
to
her
sanity
a
cross
road
he
murmured
gracious
we
never
remember
all
that
exclaimed
amy
i
have
it
down
said
practical
betty
as
she
wrote
rapidly
in
her
note
book
i
sure
we
can
find
it
come
on
girls
have
another
candy
invited
grace
hospitably
extending
the
now
nearly
depleted
box
sure
thanks
exclaimed
the
boy
but
he
backed
quickly
away
from
her
her
joke
had
fallen
on
a
suspicious
mind
evidently
the
girls
trudged
on
rather
silent
now
for
somehow
the
edge
of
their
enjoyment
seemed
to
have
been
taken
off
but
still
they
were
not
discouraged
they
were
true
outdoor
girls
and
they
knew
even
if
worse
came
to
worst
and
darkness
found
them
far
from
their
destination
and
betty
aunt
house
that
no
real
harm
could
come
to
them
successfully
they
found
the
various
points
of
identification
mentioned
by
the
freckled
boy
and
at
last
they
located
a
that
read
five
miles
to
rockford
five
miles
exclaimed
grace
with
a
tragic
air
we
can
never
do
it
we
must
declared
betty
firmly
of
course
we
can
do
it
why
even
with
going
out
of
our
way
as
we
did
we
wo
have
covered
more
than
eighteen
miles
and
we
set
twenty
as
an
average
but
this
is
the
first
day
said
mollie
we
can
we
get
to
rockford
insisted
betty
rather
hopelessly
they
tramped
on
the
sun
seemed
to
sink
with
surprising
rapidity
after
getting
to
a
certain
point
in
the
western
sky
it
dropping
faster
and
faster
all
the
while
cried
amy
as
they
watched
it
from
a
crest
of
the
road
never
mind
june
evenings
are
the
longest
of
the
year
consoled
betty
they
hurried
on
the
sun
sank
to
its
nightly
rest
amid
a
bed
of
golden
green
purple
pink
and
olive
clouds
and
there
followed
a
glorious
maze
of
colors
that
reached
high
up
toward
zenith
girls
we
simply
must
stop
and
admire
this
if
it
only
for
a
minute
exclaimed
grace
is
that
wonderful
and
she
pointed
a
slender
hand
beautified
by
exquisitely
kept
nails
toward
the
gorgeous
sky
picture
every
minute
counts
remarked
practical
betty
yet
she
knew
better
than
to
worry
her
friends
the
glow
faded
and
again
the
girls
advanced
from
the
fields
came
the
lowing
of
the
cows
as
they
waited
impatiently
for
the
bars
of
the
pastures
to
be
let
down
a
herd
of
sheep
was
driven
along
the
road
raising
a
cloud
of
dust
from
farm
houses
came
the
barking
of
dogs
and
the
not
unmusical
notes
of
conch
or
tin
horns
summoning
the
men
folks
to
the
evening
meal
girls
we
never
going
to
make
it
in
time
exclaimed
grace
as
the
sky
darkened
we
must
see
if
we
ca
stop
at
one
of
these
houses
over
night
and
she
pointed
to
a
little
hamlet
they
were
approaching
grace
exclaimed
betty
aunt
sallie
would
be
worried
to
death
if
we
did
come
after
she
expected
us
then
we
must
send
her
word
i
ca
go
another
step
they
all
paused
irresolutely
they
were
in
front
of
a
big
white
house
a
typical
country
home
betty
glanced
toward
it
it
too
bad
she
said
i
know
just
how
you
feel
and
yet
can
we
go
up
to
one
of
these
places
perfect
strangers
and
ask
them
to
keep
us
over
night
it
does
seem
reasonable
anything
is
reasonable
when
you
have
to
declared
mollie
i
ask
she
volunteered
starting
toward
the
house
the
worst
they
can
say
is
and
maybe
we
can
hire
a
team
to
drive
to
rockford
if
they
keep
us
i
can
drive
well
we
ask
anyhow
agreed
betty
rather
hopelessly
she
hardly
knew
what
to
do
next
as
they
advanced
toward
the
house
the
savage
barking
of
a
dog
was
heard
and
as
they
reached
the
front
gate
the
beast
came
rushing
down
the
walk
while
behind
him
lumbered
a
farmer
shouting
here
come
back
down
nero
do
mind
him
ladies
he
added
he
wo
hurt
you
but
the
aspect
and
the
savage
growls
and
barks
of
the
creature
seemed
to
indicate
differently
and
the
girls
shrank
back
betty
reaching
in
her
bag
drew
out
the
nearly
emptied
olive
bottle
for
a
weapon
do
hit
him
do
hit
him
cried
the
farmer
that
will
only
make
him
worse
come
back
here
nero
run
girls
run
begged
amy
he
tear
us
to
pieces
and
she
turned
and
fled
chapter
xii
at
aunt
probably
that
was
the
most
unwise
course
poor
amy
could
have
taken
dogs
even
the
most
savage
seldom
come
to
a
direct
attack
unless
their
prospective
victim
shows
fear
then
like
a
horse
that
takes
advantage
of
a
timid
driver
the
creature
advances
boldly
to
the
attack
it
was
so
in
this
case
the
other
girls
not
heeding
amy
frantic
appeal
stood
still
but
she
ran
back
toward
the
road
her
short
skirt
giving
her
a
chance
to
exercise
her
speed
the
dog
saw
and
singling
out
her
as
the
most
favorable
for
his
purposes
he
leaped
the
fence
in
a
great
bound
and
rushed
after
the
startled
girl
stop
him
stop
him
oh
amy
if
she
falls
i
know
i
going
to
faint
do
you
dare
do
it
grace
ford
why
does
that
man
keep
his
dog
chained
these
were
only
a
few
of
the
expressions
that
came
from
the
lips
of
the
girls
as
they
watched
the
dog
rush
after
poor
amy
never
had
she
run
so
fast
not
even
during
one
of
the
basket
ball
games
in
which
she
had
played
nor
when
they
had
races
at
the
sunday
school
picnic
and
had
it
not
been
for
a
certain
hired
man
who
taking
in
the
situation
as
he
came
on
the
run
from
the
barn
acted
promptly
amy
might
have
been
severely
injured
as
it
was
the
farmer
man
crossing
the
yard
diagonally
was
able
to
intercept
the
dog
run
to
the
left
miss
run
to
the
left
he
cried
then
leaping
the
low
fence
at
a
bound
he
threw
the
pitchfork
he
carried
at
the
dog
with
such
skill
that
the
handle
crossed
between
the
brute
legs
and
tripped
it
turning
over
and
over
in
a
series
of
somersaults
the
dog
progress
was
sufficiently
halted
to
enable
the
hired
man
to
get
to
it
he
took
a
firm
grip
in
the
collar
of
the
dog
and
held
on
poor
amy
stumbled
a
few
steps
farther
and
then
betty
recovering
her
scattered
wits
cried
out
all
right
amy
all
right
you
in
no
danger
and
amy
sank
to
the
ground
while
her
chums
rushed
toward
her
hold
him
zeke
hold
him
cried
the
farmer
as
he
came
lumbering
up
hold
on
to
him
that
what
i
doin
responded
the
hired
man
is
th
gal
hurted
land
sakes
i
never
knew
nero
to
act
so
went
on
the
farmer
apologetically
he
must
have
been
teased
by
some
of
th
boys
be
you
hurted
miss
pale
and
trembling
amy
arose
but
it
was
very
evident
that
she
had
suffered
no
serious
harm
for
the
dog
had
not
reached
her
and
she
had
simply
collapsed
on
the
grass
rather
than
fallen
the
dog
choking
and
growling
was
firmly
held
by
the
hired
man
who
seemed
to
have
no
fear
of
him
i
awfully
sorry
said
the
farmer
contritely
i
never
knew
him
to
act
like
that
some
one
has
tied
a
lot
of
burrs
on
his
tail
called
out
the
hired
man
that
what
set
him
off
i
thought
so
well
clean
off
and
he
behave
poor
old
nero
even
now
the
dog
was
quieting
down
and
as
the
hired
man
removed
the
irritating
cause
of
the
beast
anger
it
became
even
gentle
whining
as
though
to
offer

with
her
eyes
questioned
her
chums
they
nodded
an
assent
really
they
were
entitled
to
something
it
seemed
after
the
unwarranted
attack
of
the
dog
we
ought
to
be
going
on
to
rockford
said
betty
as
they
strolled
toward
the
pleasant
farm
house
i
do

how
we
can
get
there
now

leave
that
to
me
said
the
farmer
quickly
i
owe
you
something
on
account
of
the
way
nero
behaved
ai
you
ashamed
of
yourself
he
charged
the
dog
crouched
whined
and
thumped
the
earth
with
a
contrite
tail
he
did
not
need
the
restraining
hand
of
the
hired
man
now
make
friends
ordered
the
farmer
the
dog
approached
the
girls
oh
do
begged
amy
he
would
hurt
a
fly
bragged
the
farmer
i
ca
account
for
his
meanness
it
was
them
burrs
affirmed
the
hired
man
mebby
so
young
ladies
come
in
and
make
yourselves
t
hum
behave
nero
for
now
the
dog
was
getting
too
friendly
leaping
up
and
trying
to
solicit
caresses
from
the
girls
that
th
way
with
him
one
minute
he
up
to
some
mischief
an
th
next
he
beggin
your
pardon
i
hope
you
not
hurt
miss
and
he
looked
anxiously
at
amy
no
not
at
all
she
assured
him
with
a
smile
that
was
brave
and
winning
i
was
only
frightened
that
all
i
glad
of
that
i
have
t
tie
that
dog
up
i
guess
and
he
threw
a
little
clod
of
earth
at
the
now
cringing
animal
not
hitting
him
however
oh
do
hurt
him
pleaded
betty
hurt
him
he
would
do
that
miss
exclaimed
the
hired
man
who
now
had
to
defend
himself
from
the
affections
of
the
dog
too
fond
of
him
nero
is
a
bad
sort
generally
only
some
of
the
boys
worried
him
the
girls
with
the
farmer
and
his
man
in
the
lead
walked
toward
the
house
the
woman
hurrying
on
ahead
to
set
more
places
at
the
table
i
afraid
we
troubling
you
too
much
protested
betty
oh
it
no
trouble
at
all
the
farmer
assured
her
and
i
owe
you
something
on
account
of
my
dog
actions
but
really
ought
we
to
stay
asked
grace
it
getting
dark
betty
and
your
aunt
say
young
ladies
exclaimed
the
farmer
i
fix
that
all
right
as
soon
as
you
have
a
bite
to
eat
i
hitch
up
and
drive
you
over
to
rockford
to
bill
palmer
oh
began
betty
we
could
think
she
stopped
for
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
truly
it
was
quite
a
dilemma
in
which
they
found
themselves
and
they
must
stay
somewhere
that
night
to
remain
at
a
strange
farm
house
was
out
of
the
question
perhaps
this
was
the
simplest
way
after
all
it
wo
be
any
trouble
at
all
the
farmer
assured
her
i
got
a
fast
team
and
a
carriage
i
have
you
over
there
in
no
time
then
perhaps
we
better
not
stop
for
supper
said
mollie
your
aunt
might
be
worrying
betty
and
we
telephone
her
exclaimed
the
farmer
i
got
a
lots
of
us
have
around
here
and
i
can
let
her
know
all
about
it
or
you
can
talk
to
her
yourself
he
added
so
it
was
arranged
and
soon
betty
was
talking
to
her
anxious
relative
over
the
wire
then
after
a
bountiful
supper
which
the
girls
very
much
enjoyed
the
farmer
hitched
up
his
fine
team
and
soon
they
were
on
their
way
to
palmer
the
drive
was
not
a
long
one
my
exclaimed
mollie
as
they
bowled
along
over
the
smooth
road
under
a
young
moon
that
silvered
the
earth
this
is
better
than
walking
i
should
say
so
agreed
grace
whose
shoes
hurt
her
more
than
she
cared
to
admit
you
are
both
traitors
to
the
club
exclaimed
betty
the
idea
of
preferring
riding
to
walking
oh
it
only
once
in
a
while
added
mollie
really
pet
we
had
a
perfectly
grand
time
even
with
the
dog
added
amy
who
was
now
herself
again
i
was
silly
to
run
i
do
blame
you
said
the
farmer
and
yet
if
you
had
maybe
nero
would
have
chased
you
it
a
good
thing
not
to
run
from
a
dog
if
you
stand
it
let
him
see
you
not
afraid
put
that
down
in
your
books
girls
directed
betty
never
run
from
a
dog
that
advice
may
come
in
useful
on
our
trip
half
an
hour
later
they
were
at
palmer
house
and
received
a
hearty
welcome
the
telephone
message
having
done
much
to
relieve
the
lady
anxiety
chapter
xiii
the
missing
lunch
oh
but
these
shoes
are
so
comfortable
i
glad
of
that
grace
though
i
did
really
delay
you
much
did
i
no
i
was
complaining
and
betty
put
a
caressing
hand
on
the
arm
of
her
companion
we
be
able
to
make
up
for
lost
time
now
said
mollie
as
she
shifted
her
little
valise
from
one
hand
to
the
other
your
aunt
was
certainly
generous
in
the
matter
of
lunch
betty
she
went
on
yes
she
said
this
country
air
would
give
us
good
appetites
i
sure
i
do
need
any
spoke
amy
i
been
hungry
ever
since
we
started
the
four
girls
were
again
on
the
broad
highway
that
was
splashed
and
spotted
with
the
streaks
of
the
early
sun
as
it
slanted
through
the
elms
and
maples
along
the
road
they
had
spent
two
nights
at
the
home
of
betty
aunt
that
lady
having
insisted
on
a
little
longer
visit
than
was
at
first
planned
she
made
the
girls
royally
welcome
as
did
her
husband
grace
shoes
had
been
sent
to
her
at
rockford
having
been
telephoned
for
but
if
we
stay
another
day
and
night
here
said
betty
not
that
not
glad
to
aunt
sallie
why
we
ca
keep
up
to
our
schedule
in
walking
and
we
must
cover
so
many
miles
each
day
you
see
it
in
the
constitution
of
our
club
added
grace
we
violate
that
oh
come
now
insisted
palmer
you
can
stay
longer
just
as
well
as
not
as
for
walking
why
we
got
some
of
the
finest
walks
going
right
around
rockford
here
you
better
stay
we
do
very
often
see
you
betty
and
your
aunt
is
half
talked
out
yet
and
he
solemnly
winked
over
the
head
of
his
wife
the
idea
she
exclaimed
as
if
i
talked
half
as
much
as
you
had
and
so
the
girls
had
remained
they
had
greatly
enjoyed
the
visit
in
anticipation
of
their
coming
palmer
had
prepared
enough
for
a
regiment
of
hungry
boys
to
quote
her
husband
and
had
invited
a
number
of
the
neighboring
young
people
to
meet
the
members
of
the
camping
and
tramping
club
the
dainty
rooms
of
the
country
house
with
their
quaint
striped
wall
paper
the
big
beds
a
relic
of
a
generation
the
mahogany
dressers
with
their
shining
mirrors
and
the
delightful
atmosphere
all
had
combined
to
make
the
stay
of
the
girls
most
pleasant
the
day
after
their
arrival
by
carriage
they
had
gone
on
a
long
walk
visiting
a
picturesque
little
glen
not
far
from
the
village
being
accompanied
by
a
number
of
girls
whose
acquaintance
betty
and
her
chums
had
made
some
of
them
betty
had
met
before
the
idea
of
a
walking
club
was
enthusiastically
received
by
the
country
girls
and
they
at
once
resolved
to
form
one
like
the
organization
started
by
betty
nelson
in
fact
they
named
it
after
her
in
spite
of
her
protests
in
the
afternoon
the
girls
went
for
a
drive
in
palmer
big
carriage
visiting
places
of
local
interest
and
in
the
evening
there
was
an
surprise
party
a
real
surprise
too
by
the
way
for
betty
and
her
chums
had
never
dreamed
of
it
it
was
a
most
delightful
time
and
palmer
had
tried
to
persuade
their
niece
and
her
chums
to
stay
still
longer
but
they
were
firm
in
their
determination
to
cover
the
two
hundred
miles
more
or
less
in
the
specified
time
so
they
had
started
off
and
the
snatches
of
conversation
with
which
i
begun
this
chapter
might
have
been
heard
as
the
four
walked
along
the
pleasant
country
road
we
had
very
good
luck
so
far
said
mollie
as
she
skipped
a
few
steps
in
advance
on
the
greensward
not
a
bit
of
rain
do
boast
cautioned
betty
it
will
be
perfectly
terrible
if
it
rains
we
simply
ca
walk
if
it
does
i
do
see
why
not
spoke
mollie
trying
to
catch
amy
in
a
waltz
hug
and
whirl
her
about
my
is
she
getting
giddy
mocked
grace
i
feel
so
good
cried
mollie
whose
volatile
nature
seemed
fairly
bubbling
over
on
this
beautiful
day
and
indeed
it
was
a
day
to
call
forth
all
the
latent
energies
of
the
most
phlegmatic
person
the
very
air
tingled
with
life
that
the
sunshine
coaxed
into
being
and
the
gentle
wind
further
fanned
it
to
rapidity
of
action
oh
i
do
feel
so
happy
cried
mollie
i
guess
we
all
do
spoke
grace
but
even
as
she
said
this
she
could
not
refrain
from
covertly
glancing
at
amy
over
whose
face
there
seemed
a
shade
of
well
just
what
it
was
grace
could
not
decide
it
might
have
been
disappointment
or
perhaps
an
unsatisfied
longing
clearly
the
mystery
over
her
past
had
made
an
impression
on
the
character
of
this
sweet
quiet
girl
but
for
all
that
she
did
not
inflict
her
mood
on
her
chums
she
must
have
become
conscious
of
grace
quick
scrutiny
for
with
a
laugh
she
ran
to
her
and
soon
the
two
were
bobbing
about
on
the
uneven
turf
in
what
they
were
pleased
to
term
a
dance
your
aunt
was
certainly
good
to
us
murmured
mollie
a
little
later
i
just
dying
to
see
what
she
has
put
up
for
our
lunch
for
palmer
had
insisted
as
has
been
said
on
packing
one
of
the
little
valises
the
girls
carried
with
a
meal
to
be
eaten
on
the
road
mollie
was
entrusted
with
this
her
belongings
having
been
divided
among
her
chums
oh
suddenly
cried
grace
a
moment
later
i
forgot
something
you
mean
you
left
it
at
my
aunt
house
asked
betty
coming
to
a
stop
in
the
road
no
i
forgot
to
get
some
of
those
lovely
chocolates
that
new
drug
store
sells
they
were
delicious
for
a
country
town
i
never
ate
better
grace
you
are
hopeless
sighed
betty
come
along
girls
do
or
she
insist
on
going
back
for
them
and
we
must
get
to
middleville
on
time
it
wo
do
to
fall
back
in
our
schedule
any
more
i
sent
a
postal
to
my
cousin
from
your
aunt
house
said
amy
at
whose
relatives
the
girls
were
to
spend
the
night
i
told
her
we
surely
would
be
there
and
so
we
will
said
betty
gracious
i
forgot
to
mail
this
card
to
nettie
french
and
she
produced
a
souvenir
card
from
her
pocket
never
mind
you
can
put
it
in
the
next
we
come
to
suggested
grace
oh
dear
i
so
provoked
about
those
chocolates
positively
famished
and
i
do
suppose
it
is
anywhere
near
lunch
time
and
she
looked
at
her
watch
no
only
ten
and
she
sighed
laughing
at
her
the
girls
stepped
on
for
a
time
the
road
ran
along
a
pleasant
little
river
on
which
a
number
of
canoes
and
boats
could
be
seen
oh
for
a
good
row
exclaimed
mollie
we
have
plenty
of
chances
this
summer
said
betty
it
has
hardly
begun
i
wonder
where
we
will
spend
our
vacation
spoke
mollie
we
talk
about
that
later
said
betty
i
hope
we
can
be
together
and
somewhere
near
the
water
if
we
only
could
get
a
motor
boat
sighed
grace
oh
bet
if
no
one
claims
that
five
hundred
dollars
maybe
we
can
get
a
little
launch
with
it
and
camp
at
rainbow
lake
i
only
afraid
some
one
will
claim
it
spoke
betty
i
dropped
papa
a
card
telling
him
to
send
me
a
line
in
case
a
claimant
did
appear
oh
let
sit
down
and
rest
proposed
mollie
a
little
later
a
perfect
dream
of
a
view
from
here
and
it
so
cool
and
shady
the
others
were
agreeable
so
they
stopped
beneath
some
big
trees
in
a
grassy
spot
near
the
bank
of
the
little
stream
grace
took
advantage
of
the
stop
to
mend
a
pair
of
stockings
she
was
carrying
with
her
it
was
so
comfortable
that
they
remained
nearly
an
hour
and
would
have
stayed
longer
only
the
little
captain
with
a
look
at
her
watch
decided
that
they
must
get
under
way
again
now
it
noon
exclaimed
grace
when
they
had
covered
two
miles
after
their
rest
mollie
open
the
lunch
and
let
see
what
it
contains
there
was
a
startled
cry
from
mollie
a
clasping
of
her
hands
a
raising
of
her
almost
tragic
eyes
and
she
exclaimed
oh
girls
forgive
me
i
forgot
the
lunch
i
left
it
back
there
where
we
rested
in
the
shade
chapter
xiv
the
broken
rail
dumb
amazement
held
the
girls
in
suspense
for
a
moment
then
came
a
chorus
of
cries
mollie
you
never
did
that
forgot
our
lunch
and
we
so
hungry
oh
mollie
how
could
you
you
do
suppose
i
did
it
on
purpose
do
you
flashed
back
the
guilty
one
as
she
looked
at
the
three
pairs
of
tragic
and
hopeless
eyes
fastened
on
her
of
course
you
did
returned
betty
but
oh
mollie
is
it
really
gone
did
you
leave
it
there
well
i
have
it
with
me
none
of
you
have
and
i
do
remember
picking
it
up
after
we
slumped
down
there
in
the
shade
consequently
i
must
have
left
it
there
there
no
other
solution
it
like
one
of
those
queer
problems
in
geometry
or
is
it
algebra
where
things
that
are
equal
to
the
same
thing
are
equal
to
each
other
and
she
laughed
with
just
the
hint
of
hysteria
but
what
are
we
to
do
demanded
grace
i
am
so
hungry
and
i
know
there
were
chicken
sandwiches
and
olives
in
that
lunch
oh
mollie
oh
mollie
mocked
the
negligent
one
if
you
say
that
again
that
way
her
temper
was
rising
but
by
an
effort
she
conquered
it
and
smiled
i
am
truly
sorry
she
said
girls
i
do
anything
to
make
up
for
it
i
run
back
and
get
the
lunch
that
is
if
it
is
there
yet
do
you
dare
say
it
is
cried
betty
why
ca
we
all
go
back
suggested
amy
really
it
wo
delay
us
so
much
if
we
walk
fast
and
that
was
a
nice
place
to
eat
there
was
a
lovely
spring
just
across
the
road
i
noticed
it
we
could
make
tea
little
comforter
whispered
betty
putting
her
arms
around
the
other
we
will
all
go
back
the
day
is
so
perfect
that
there
sure
to
be
a
lovely
moon
and
we
can
stop
somewhere
and
telephone
to
your
cousin
if
we
find
we
are
going
to
be
delayed
she
has
an
auto
i
believe
you
said
and
she
might
come
and
get
us
stop
commanded
mollie
we
are
a
walking
club
not
a
carriage
or
auto
club
we
walk
then
let
put
our
principles
into
practice
and
start
now
proposed
grace
we
have
a
good
incentive
in
the
lunch
at
the
end
of
this
tramp
come
on
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
retrace
their
steps
true
they
might
have
stopped
at
some
wayside
restaurant
but
such
places
were
not
frequent
and
such
as
there
were
did
not
seem
very
inviting
and
aunt
sallie
had
certainly
put
up
a
most
delectable
lunch
the
girls
reached
the
spot
where
they
had
stopped
for
a
rest
much
sooner
than
they
had
deemed
it
possible
perhaps
they
walked
faster
than
usual
and
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
quiet
little
grassy
spot
mollie
exclaimed
oh
girls
i
see
it
just
where
i
so
stupidly
left
it
near
that
big
rock
hurry
before
someone
gets
there
ahead
of
us
they
broke
into
a
run
but
a
moment
later
grace
cried
too
late
that
tramp
has
it
the
girls
stopped
in
dismay
as
they
saw
a
rather
man
slink
out
from
the
shadow
of
a
tree
and
pick
up
the
lunch
valise
he
stood
regarding
it
curiously
oh
dear
cried
grace
and
i
was
so
hungry
betty
strode
forward
there
was
a
look
of
determination
on
her
face
she
spoke
girls
i
not
going
to
let
that
tramp
take
our
lovely
lunch
come
on
and
i
make
him
give
it
back
betty
cried
amy
you
never
dare
i
would
watch
me
the
man
was
still
standing
there
looking
at
the
valise
as
if
in
doubt
whether
or
not
to
open
it
betty
with
a
glance
at
her
chums
walked
on
they
followed
that
that
ours
if
you
please
said
betty
her
voice
was
weaker
than
she
had
thought
it
would
be
and
quite
wobbly
too
her
knees
she
confessed
later
were
in
the
same
state
but
she
presented
a
brave
front
that
that
our
lunch
she
added
swallowing
a
lump
in
her
throat
the
man
he
certainly
looked
like
a
tramp
as
far
as
his
clothes
were
concerned
but
his
face
was
clean
turned
toward
the
girls
with
a
smile
your
lunch
he
exclaimed
and
his
voice
was
not
unmusical
how
fortunate
he
did
not
say
whether
it
was
fortunate
for
them
or
himself
we
we
forgot
it
we
left
it
here
explained
mollie
that
is
i
left
it
here
that
is
unfortunate
said
the
man
it
seems
it
seems
to
be
a
fairly
substantial
lunch
and
he
moved
the
bag
up
and
down
it
ought
to
be
for
four
of
us
breathed
amy
allow
me
spoke
the
man
and
with
a
bow
he
handed
the
missing
lunch
to
betty
the
girls
said
afterward
that
her
hand
did
not
tremble
a
bit
as
she
accepted
it
and
then
the
little
captain
did
something
most
unexpected
perhaps
you
are
hungry
too
she
said
with
one
of
her
winning
smiles
a
smile
that
seemed
to
set
her
face
in
a
glow
of
friendliness
we
are
on
a
tramping
tour
i
mean
a
walking
tour
she
hastily
corrected
herself
feeling
that
perhaps
the
man
would
object
to
the
word
tramp
she
went
on
we
are
on
a
walking
tour
visiting
friends
and
relatives
we
generally
take
a
lunch
at
noon
yes
that
seems
to
be
the
universal
custom
agreed
the
man
that
is
for
some
persons
and
he
smiled
showing
his
white
teeth
are
you
are
you
hungry
asked
betty
bluntly
i
am
he
spoke
decidedly
then
perhaps
i
sure
we
have
more
here
than
we
can
eat
and
soon
i
mean
comparatively
soon
be
at
a
friend
house
perhaps
she
hesitated
i
would
be
very
glad
and
again
the
man
bowed
betty
opened
the
little
satchel
it
was
a
miniature
suitcase
and
a
veritable
wealth
of
lunch
was
disclosed
there
were
sandwiches
without
number
pickles
olives
chunks
of
cake
creamy
cheese
are
you
sure
you
can
spare
it
asked
the
man
i
sure
i
want
to
of
course
we
can
spare
it
put
in
mollie
quickly
well
then
i
will
admit
that
i
am
hungry
spoke
the
unknown
i
am
not
exactly
what
i
seem
he
added
betty
glanced
curiously
at
him
do
be
alarmed
he
went
on
quickly
i
am
not
exactly
sailing
under
false
colors
except
in
a
minor
way
now
for
instance
you
took
me
for
a
tramp
did
you
not
he
paused
and
smiled
i
i
think
we
did
faltered
mollie
and
i
do
blame
you
i
have
for
the
time
being
assumed
the
habiliments
of
a
knight
of
the
road
for
certain
purposes
of
my
own
i
am
well
to
be
frank
i
am
trying
to
find
something
in
order
to
carry
out
my
plans
i
have
even
begged
my
way
and
not
always
successfully
in
fact
you
are
hungry
exclaimed
grace
and
her
chums
said
she
made
a
move
as
though
to
bring
out
some
chocolates
grace
later
denied
this
i
am
hungry
confessed
the
tramp
as
he
evidently
preferred
to
appear
betty
took
out
a
generous
portion
of
food
it
is
too
much
the
wayfarer
protested
not
at
all
betty
insisted
we
have
a
double
reason
for
giving
it
to
you
first
you
are
hungry
second
please
accept
it
as
a
reward
for
for
not
eating
all
of
your
lunch
after
i
found
it
i
suppose
you
were
going
to
say
put
in
the
man
with
a
smile
very
well
then
accept
and
he
bowed
not
ungracefully
he
had
the
good
taste
or
was
it
bashfulness
to
go
over
to
a
little
grove
of
trees
to
eat
his
portion
grace
wanted
to
take
him
a
cup
of
chocolate
which
they
made
instead
of
tea
but
betty
persuaded
her
not
to
the
girls
ate
their
lunch
to
be
interrupted
in
the
midst
of
it
by
the
man
who
called
a
to
them
as
he
moved
off
down
the
road
he
going
remarked
amy
i
wonder
if
he
had
enough
i
think
so
replied
betty
now
girls
we
must
hurry
we
have
been
delayed
and
i
so
sorry
put
in
mollie
it
was
my
fault
and
do
think
of
it
my
dear
begged
grace
any
of
us
might
have
forgotten
the
lunch
just
as
you
did
as
they
walked
past
the
place
which
the
tramp
had
selected
for
his
dining
room
betty
saw
some
papers
on
the
ground
they
appeared
to
be
letters
and
rather
idly
she
picked
them
up
she
looked
into
one
or
two
of
the
torn
envelopes
i
would
do
that
said
grace
maybe
those
are
private
letters
he
must
have
forgotten
them
i
wonder
where
he
has
gone
perhaps
we
can
catch
him
he
might
need
these
papers
but
i
would
read
them
betty
they
nothing
but
advertising
circulars
retorted
the
little
captain
nothing
very
private
about
them
i
guess
he
threw
them
all
away
she
was
about
to
let
them
fall
from
her
hand
when
a
bit
of
paper
fluttered
from
one
envelope
picking
it
up
betty
was
astonished
to
read
on
the
torn
portion
the
words
can
not
carry
out
that
deal
i
arranged
with
you
because
i
have
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
five
hundred
dollars
and
i
shall
have
there
the
paper
evidently
part
of
a
letter
to
someone
was
torn
off
there
were
no
other
words
girls
cried
betty
look
see
this
letter
that
man
may
be
the
one
whose
money
we
found
he
has
written
about
it
as
nearly
as
i
can
recall
the
writing
is
like
that
in
the
note
pinned
to
the
five
hundred
dollars
oh
we
must
find
that
tramp
he
was
a
tramp
exclaimed
grace
no
i
do
believe
he
was
either
admitted
betty
that
what
he
meant
when
he
spoke
of
his
disguise
and
looking
for
something
hunting
for
his
five
hundred
dollars
oh
dear
which
way
did
he
go
toward
middleville
returned
amy
then
we
must
hurry
up
and
catch
him
we
can
explain
that
we
have
his
money
but
are
you
sure
it
is
his
asked
mollie
this
looks
like
it
said
betty
holding
out
the
torn
letter
but
some
one
else
might
have
lost
five
hundred
dollars
protested
grace
come
on
we
find
him
and
ask
him
about
it
anyhow
suggested
betty
middleville
is
on
our
way
oh
to
think
how
things
may
turn
out
hurry
girls
they
hastily
gathered
up
their
belongings
and
walked
on
talking
of
their
latest
adventure
he
was
real
nice
looking
said
mollie
and
quite
polite
added
amy
and
do
you
think
he
may
be
traveling
around
like
a
tramp
searching
for
that
bill
asked
grace
it
possible
declared
betty
perhaps
he
could
help
looking
like
a
tramp
because
if
he
has
lost
all
his
money
he
ca
afford
any
other
clothes
oh
i
do
hope
we
find
him
but
it
was
a
vain
hope
they
did
not
see
the
man
along
the
road
and
inquiries
of
several
persons
they
met
gave
no
trace
nor
had
he
reached
middleville
as
far
as
could
be
learned
if
he
had
no
one
had
noticed
him
oh
dear
sighed
betty
when
they
had
exhausted
all
possibilities
i
did
hope
that
money
mystery
was
going
to
be
solved
now
it
as
far
off
as
ever
but
i
keep
this
torn
piece
of
letter
for
evidence
poor
fellow
he
may
have
built
great
hopes
on
that
five
hundred
dollar
bill
then
to
lose
it
they
went
to
the
house
of
amy
cousin
in
middleville
there
they
spent
an
enjoyable
evening
meeting
some
friends
who
had
been
invited
in
amy
said
nothing
about
the
disclosure
to
her
of
the
strange
incident
in
her
life
probably
she
reflected
her
relative
already
knew
it
morning
saw
them
on
the
move
again
with
broxton
where
a
married
sister
of
grace
lived
as
their
objective
point
the
day
was
cloudy
but
it
did
not
seem
that
it
would
rain
at
least
before
night
and
even
the
frown
of
the
weather
did
not
detract
from
the
happiness
of
the
chums
they
laughed
and
talked
as
they
walked
on
making
merry
by
the
way
stopping
in
a
country
store
to
make
sure
of
their
route
they
were
informed
that
by
taking
to
the
railroad
track
for
a
short
distance
they
could
save
considerable
time
then
we
ought
to
do
it
decided
betty
for
we
do
want
to
get
caught
in
the
rain
and
she
glanced
up
at
the
clouds
that
were
now
more
threatening
they
reached
the
railroad
track
a
short
distance
out
of
the
little
village
and
proceeded
down
the
stretch
of
rails
there
a
train
in
half
an
hour
a
man
informed
them
but
you
be
off
long
before
then
i
hope
so
murmured
amy
they
had
nearly
reached
the
end
of
the
ballasted
way
when
betty
who
was
in
the
lead
came
to
a
sudden
halt
what
is
it
asked
mollie
a
snake
oh
girls
no
not
a
snake
was
the
quick
answer
but
look
this
rail
is
broken
it
must
have
cracked
when
the
last
train
passed
and
another
one
an
express
is
due
soon
if
it
runs
over
that
broken
rail
it
may
be
wrecked
girls
we
got
to
stop
that
train
and
she
faced
her
chums
resolutely
chapter
xv
it
a
bear
what
can
we
do
it
was
grace
who
asked
the
question
it
was
betty
the
little
captain
who
answered
it
we
must
stop
the
train
she
said
we
must
wave
something
red
at
it
red
always
means
danger
mollie
tie
exclaimed
amy
mollie
was
wearing
a
bright
vermilion
scarf
knotted
about
the
collar
of
her
blouse
it
is
big
enough
decided
betty
but
we
must
do
something
that
man
said
the
train
would
come
along
soon
it
an
express
a
slow
train
might
not
go
off
the
track
as
the
break
is
only
a
small
one
but
the
express
she
paused
suggestively
apprehensively
there
a
man
cried
grace
a
cried
betty
oh
he
know
what
to
do
and
she
darted
toward
a
man
just
appearing
around
the
curve
a
man
with
a
sledge
and
wrench
over
his
shoulder
hey
hey
betty
called
come
here
there
a
broken
rail
the
man
broke
into
a
run
what
that
he
called
got
your
foot
caught
in
a
rail
it
a
frog
a
switch
that
you
mean
take
off
your
shoe
no
we
not
caught
cried
betty
in
shrill
accent
the
rail
is
broken
the
was
near
enough
now
to
hear
her
correctly
and
fortunately
he
understood
which
might
have
been
expected
of
him
considering
his
line
of
work
it
a
bad
break
he
affirmed
as
he
looked
at
it
sometimes
the
heat
of
the
sun
will
warp
a
rail
and
pull
out
the
very
spikes
by
the
roots
ladies
that
what
happened
here
then
a
train
was
the
local
from
dunkirk
came
along
and
split
the
rail
is
a
wonder
jimmie
flannigan
did
see
it
this
is
his
bit
of
track
but
his
wife
is
sick
and
i
said
i
come
down
to
meet
him
with
a
bite
to
eat
seein
as
how
she
ca
put
up
his
dinner
is
lucky
you
saw
it
in
time
ladies
but
what
about
the
train
asked
betty
oh
i
stop
that
all
right
i
flag
it
and
jimmie
and
me
put
in
a
new
rail
you
be
noticin
that
we
have
here
and
there
along
the
line
and
he
showed
them
where
a
little
distance
down
the
track
there
were
a
number
placed
in
racks
made
of
posts
so
that
they
might
not
rust
from
his
pocket
the
pulled
a
red
flag
it
seemed
that
he
carried
it
there
for
just
such
emergencies
he
tied
it
to
his
pick
handle
and
stuck
the
latter
in
the
track
some
distance
away
from
the
broken
rail
the
engineer
see
that
he
said
and
stop
now
i
go
get
jimmie
and
we
put
in
a
new
rail
you
young
ladies
why
th
railroad
company
be
very
thankful
to
you
if
you
was
to
stop
here
now
and
the
passengers
of
the
train
were
told
of
what
you
found
why
they
might
even
make
up
a
purse
for
you
they
did
that
to
mike
malone
once
when
he
flagged
the
century
flier
when
it
was
goin
to
slip
over
a
broken
bridge
i
tell
how
it
was
and
how
you
no
no
we
ca
stay
exclaimed
betty
if
you
will
look
after
the
broken
rail
we
go
on
we
must
get
to
broxton
oh
sure
it
not
take
the
likes
of
you
long
to
be
doin
that
complimented
the
man
with
a
trace
of
brogue
in
his
voice
you
look
equal
to
doin
twice
as
much
well
we
do
want
to
be
caught
in
the
rain
spoke
mollie
ah
be
nothin
more
than
a
sun
shower
it
will
make
your
complexions
better
not
that
you
need
it
though
he
hastened
to
add
good
luck
to
you
and
many
thanks
for
tellin
me
about
this
broken
rail
is
poor
jimmie
who
be
blamed
for
not
seein
it
and
him
with
a
sick
wife
to
you
the
girls
satisfied
that
the
train
would
be
flagged
in
time
soon
left
the
track
the
last
glimpse
they
had
of
the
workman
being
as
he
hurried
off
to
summon
his
partner
to
replace
the
broken
rail
that
he
did
so
was
proved
a
little
later
for
when
the
girls
were
walking
along
the
road
that
ran
parallel
to
the
railroad
line
some
distance
farther
on
the
express
dashed
by
at
a
speed
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
engineer
was
making
up
for
lost
time
several
days
later
the
girls
read
in
a
local
paper
of
how
the
train
had
been
stopped
while
two
fitted
a
perfect
rail
in
place
of
the
broken
one
and
something
of
themselves
was
told
for
the
they
had
met
had
talked
of
the
young
ladies
he
had
met
and
there
was
much
printed
speculation
about
them
i
glad
we
did
give
our
names
said
grace
our
folks
might
have
worried
if
they
had
read
of
it
but
we
might
have
gotten
a
reward
said
mollie
never
mind
we
have
the
five
hundred
dollars
exclaimed
grace
it
may
already
be
claimed
spoke
betty
when
they
had
seen
the
express
go
safely
by
thankful
that
they
had
had
a
small
share
in
preventing
a
possible
loss
of
life
the
girls
continued
on
their
way
they
stopped
for
lunch
in
a
little
grove
of
trees
brewing
tea
and
partaking
of
the
cake
bread
and
meat
amy
cousin
had
provided
amy
had
torn
her
skirt
on
a
barbed
wire
fence
and
the
rent
was
sewed
up
beside
the
road
the
clouds
seemed
to
be
gathering
more
thickly
and
with
rather
anxious
looks
at
the
sky
the
members
of
the
camping
and
tramping
club
hastened
on
girls
we
going
to
get
wet
exclaimed
mollie
as
they
passed
a
pausing
to
look
at
the
and
it
five
miles
farther
on
to
broxton
said
amy
can
we
ever
make
it
i
think
so
if
we
hurry
said
betty
a
little
rain
wo
hurt
us
these
suits
are
made
to
stand
a
drenching
then
let
walk
fast
proposed
grace
she
would
have
said
that
with
those
other
shoes
remarked
amy
drily
got
any
candy
demanded
mollie
i
hungry
without
a
word
grace
produced
a
bag
of
chocolates
it
was
surprising
how
she
seemed
to
keep
supplied
with
them
the
girls
were
hurrying
along
now
and
then
looking
apprehensively
at
the
and
black
clouds
when
as
they
turned
a
bend
in
the
road
amy
who
was
walking
beside
grace
cried
out
oh
it
a
bear
it
a
bear
what
that
a
new
song
demanded
mollie
laughing
no
look
look
screamed
amy
and
she
pointed
to
a
huge
hairy
creature
lumbering
down
the
middle
of
the
highway
chapter
xvi
the
deserted
house
the
girls
screamed
in
concert
and
whose
voice
was
the
loudest
was
a
matter
that
was
in
doubt
not
that
the
little
captain
and
her
chums
lingered
long
to
determine
the
bear
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
the
road
standing
on
its
hind
legs
waving
its
huge
forepaws
and
lolling
its
head
from
side
to
side
in
a
sort
of
comical
amazement
run
run
screamed
betty
to
the
woods
oh
oh
oh
that
seemed
the
extent
of
mollie
vocabulary
just
then
climb
a
tree
was
the
advice
of
grace
is
he
coming
is
it
coming
after
us
amy
wanted
to
know
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
as
she
put
the
question
and
there
nearly
followed
an
accident
for
amy
was
running
and
the
look
back
caused
her
to
stumble
betty
who
was
racing
beside
her
just
managed
to
save
her
chum
from
a
bad
fall
all
the
girls
were
running
running
as
though
their
lives
depended
on
their
speed
luckily
they
wore
short
walking
skirts
which
did
not
hinder
free
movement
and
they
really
made
good
speed
illustration
the
bear
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
the
road
they
crossed
the
road
and
plunged
into
the
underbrush
crashing
through
it
in
very
terror
they
clung
to
their
small
suitcases
instinctively
then
suddenly
as
they
ran
on
there
came
the
clear
notes
of
a
bugle
in
an
army
call
betty
recalled
something
stop
girls
she
cried
what
with
that
bear
after
us
wailed
grace
never
it
all
right
i
tell
you
it
all
right
went
on
betty
oh
she
lost
her
mind
she
so
frightened
she
does
know
what
she
is
saying
exclaimed
mollie
oh
poor
betty
silly
stop
i
tell
you
that
bear
again
came
the
notes
of
the
bugle
and
then
the
girls
looking
through
the
fringe
of
trees
at
the
road
saw
a
man
with
a
red
jacket
and
wearing
a
hat
in
which
was
a
long
feather
come
along
and
grasp
a
chain
that
dangled
from
the
leather
muzzle
which
they
had
failed
to
notice
on
the
bear
nose
it
a
tame
bear
cried
betty
that
what
i
meant
he
wo
harm
us
come
on
back
to
the
road
oh
i
torn
my
skirt
and
she
gazed
ruefully
at
a
rent
in
the
garment
the
girls
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
understanding
the
situation
and
being
encouraged
by
the
fact
that
the
man
now
had
his
bear
in
charge
also
seeing
another
man
evidently
the
mate
of
the
first
approaching
with
a
second
bear
they
all
went
back
to
the
highway
the
bugle
blew
again
and
one
of
the
bears
at
a
command
from
the
man
turned
a
clumsy
somersault
grace
burst
into
hysterical
laughter
in
which
she
was
joined
by
the
others
were
we
silly
exclaimed
mollie
oh
but
it
looked
just
like
a
real
bear
gasped
amy
in
listen
to
her
said
betty
a
real
bear
why
of
course
it
is
did
you
think
it
was
the
teddy
variety
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
spoke
amy
i
thought
it
was
a
wild
bear
it
probably
was
once
remarked
grace
they
were
all
out
in
the
road
now
and
the
two
men
with
the
bears
were
slowly
approaching
evidently
the
foremost
man
had
seen
the
precipitate
flight
of
the
girls
so
taking
off
his
hat
and
bowing
with
foreign
politeness
he
said
excuse
please
juno
him
get
away
from
me
i
chase
after
i
catch
excuse
please
that
all
right
said
betty
pleasantly
we
were
frightened
for
a
minute
verra
sorry
juno
made
the
dance
for
the
ladies
he
blew
some
notes
on
a
battered
brass
horn
and
began
some
foreign
words
in
a
tone
at
which
the
bear
moved
clumsily
about
on
its
hind
feet
juno
kiss
the
man
cried
the
great
shaggy
creature
extended
its
muzzle
toward
the
man
face
touching
his
cheek
excuse
please
said
the
smiling
come
on
girls
suggested
amy
the
place
was
rather
a
lonely
one
though
there
were
houses
just
beyond
and
the
two
men
in
spite
of
their
bows
did
not
seem
very
prepossessing
with
hearts
that
beat
rapidly
from
their
recent
flight
and
excitement
the
girls
passed
the
bears
the
men
both
taking
off
their
hats
and
bowing
then
the
strange
company
was
lost
to
sight
down
a
turn
in
the
road
the
notes
of
the
bugles
coming
faintly
to
the
girls
gracious
that
an
adventure
exclaimed
mollie
i
thought
i
should
faint
breathed
amy
have
a
chocolate
do
urged
grace
they
nourishing
and
she
held
out
some
girls
we
must
hurry
spoke
betty
or
we
never
get
to
broxton
before
the
rain
hurry
along
they
walked
fast
passing
through
the
little
village
of
chanceford
where
they
attracted
considerable
attention
it
was
not
every
day
that
four
such
pretty
and
girls
were
seen
on
the
village
main
street
the
only
thoroughfare
by
the
way
then
they
came
to
the
open
country
again
they
had
been
going
along
at
a
good
pace
and
were
practically
certain
of
reaching
grace
sister
house
in
time
for
supper
it
raining
suddenly
exclaimed
betty
holding
up
her
hand
to
make
sure
a
drop
splashed
on
it
then
another
amy
looked
up
into
the
clouds
overhead
oh
she
cried
a
drop
fell
in
my
eye
then
with
a
suddenness
that
was
surprising
the
shower
came
down
hard
little
dark
spots
mottled
the
white
dust
of
the
road
run
cried
mollie
there
a
house
we
can
stay
on
the
porch
until
the
rain
passes
the
people
wo
mind
a
little
in
advance
enclosed
with
a
neat
red
fence
and
setting
back
some
distance
from
the
road
was
a
large
white
house
with
green
shutters
the
windows
in
front
were
open
as
was
the
front
door
and
from
one
casement
a
lace
curtain
flapped
in
the
wind
run
run
we
be
drenched
cried
grace
thinking
of
her
new
walking
suit
without
more
ado
the
girls
hurried
through
the
gate
up
the
gravel
walk
and
got
to
the
porch
just
as
the
rain
reached
its
maximum
it
was
coming
down
now
in
a
veritable
torrent
queer
the
people
here
do
shut
their
door
remarked
betty
and
see
the
rain
is
coming
in
the
parlor
window
added
amy
maybe
they
do
know
it
suggested
grace
oh
the
wind
is
blowing
the
rain
right
in
on
us
she
cried
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
impertinent
to
walk
in
suggested
mollie
we
at
least
can
knock
and
ask
they
wo
refuse
said
betty
and
really
with
the
wind
this
way
the
porch
is
no
protection
at
all
she
rapped
on
the
open
door
there
was
no
response
and
she
tapped
again
louder
to
make
it
heard
above
the
noise
of
the
storm
that
queer
maybe
no
one
is
at
home
said
grace
they
would
hardly
go
off
and
leave
the
house
all
open
when
it
looked
so
much
like
rain
declared
amy
suppose
we
call
to
them
maybe
they
are
upstairs
the
girls
were
now
getting
so
wet
that
they
decided
not
to
stand
on
ceremony
they
went
into
the
hall
through
the
front
door
there
was
a
parlor
on
one
side
and
evidently
a
sitting
room
on
the
other
side
of
the
central
hall
see
that
rain
coming
in
on
the
curtains
and
carpets
cried
betty
girls
we
must
close
the
windows
and
she
darted
into
the
parlor
the
others
followed
her
example
and
soon
the
house
was
closed
against
the
elements
breathless
the
girls
waited
for
some
sign
or
evidence
of
life
in
the
house
there
was
none
the
place
was
silent
the
only
sound
being
the
patter
of
the
rain
and
the
sighing
of
the
wind
the
girls
looked
at
each
other
then
betty
spoke
i
do
believe
there
a
soul
here
she
exclaimed
not
a
soul
the
house
is
deserted
chapter
xvii
in
charge
no
one
here
what
do
you
mean
betty
nelson
what
a
strange
thing
to
say
of
course
there
must
be
some
one
here
they
only
upstairs
maybe
shutting
the
windows
there
thus
spoke
mollie
grace
and
amy
in
turn
betty
listened
patiently
and
then
suggested
just
hearken
for
a
minute
and
see
if
you
think
anyone
is
upstairs
shutting
windows
then
all
listened
intently
there
was
not
a
sound
save
that
caused
by
the
storm
which
seemed
to
increase
in
fury
instead
of
diminishing
there
is
no
one
here
went
on
betty
positively
we
are
all
alone
in
this
house
but
where
can
the
people
be
asked
grace
they
must
be
people
living
here
and
she
looked
around
at
the
if
somewhat
parlor
of
course
the
house
is
lived
in
and
the
people
must
have
left
it
only
recently
said
betty
that
evident
why
did
they
go
off
and
leave
it
asked
mollie
that
the
mystery
of
it
admitted
betty
it
like
the
mystery
of
the
five
hundred
dollar
bill
we
got
to
solve
it
perhaps
began
amy
in
a
gentle
voice
well
asked
betty
encouragingly
maybe
the
lady
was
upstairs
shutting
the
windows
when
she
saw
the
storm
coming
and
she
fell
or
fainted
or
something
like
that
that
so
exclaimed
mollie
we
look
decided
betty
betty
chorused
grace
and
amy
why
not
the
little
captain
challenged
we
got
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
this
but
suppose
we
should
find
her
find
some
one
up
there
in
a
faint
and
amy
motioned
toward
the
upper
rooms
all
the
more
reason
for
helping
them
said
practical
betty
they
may
need
help
come
on
the
girls
left
their
things
in
the
hall
and
rather
timidly
it
must
be
confessed
ascended
the
stairs
but
they
need
not
have
been
afraid
of
seeing
some
startling
sight
the
upper
chambers
were
as
deserted
as
the
rooms
below
in
short
a
careful
examination
throughout
the
house
failed
to
disclose
a
living
creature
save
a
big
maltese
cat
which
purred
and
rubbed
in
friendly
fashion
against
the
girls
the
house
is
deserted
declared
betty
again
we
are
in
sole
and
undisputed
possession
girls
we
in
charge
for
how
long
asked
amy
until
this
storm
is
over
anyhow
we
ca
go
out
in
that
downpour
and
betty
glanced
toward
the
window
against
which
the
rain
was
dashing
furiously
we
must
close
down
the
sashes
here
too
she
exclaimed
for
one
or
two
were
open
and
the
water
was
beating
in
what
can
have
happened
murmured
mollie
is
it
strange
i
no
doubt
it
can
be
explained
simply
said
betty
the
woman
who
lives
here
may
have
gone
to
a
neighbor
house
and
failed
to
notice
the
time
then
she
may
be
as
we
are
no
woman
would
remain
at
a
neighbor
house
and
leave
her
own
alone
with
a
lot
of
windows
up
the
front
door
open
and
a
beating
rain
coming
down
said
grace
positively
not
such
a
neat
housekeeper
as
the
woman
here
seems
to
be
she
come
home
if
she
was
drenched
and
she
glanced
around
the
rooms
you
got
to
think
up
a
different
reason
than
that
betty
nelson
besides
what
of
the
men
folks
there
are
men
living
here
at
least
one
for
there
a
hat
on
the
front
rack
put
in
amy
where
are
the
men
or
the
man
they
be
along
at
supper
time
declared
betty
besides
maybe
that
hat
is
just
kept
there
to
scare
tramps
said
grace
i
often
heard
of
a
lone
woman
borrowing
a
man
hat
when
she
have
did
want
or
could
get
a
man
that
so
admitted
betty
but
speaking
of
supper
reminds
me
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
ours
it
is
getting
nearly
time
murmured
mollie
but
we
simply
ca
tramp
through
that
rain
to
your
sister
house
grace
no
we
have
to
wait
oh
dear
is
this
a
queer
predicament
to
be
in
and
not
a
chocolate
left
she
wailed
as
she
looked
in
the
box
empty
she
cried
quite
tragically
the
rain
still
descended
it
was
not
for
the
moment
pouring
as
hard
as
at
first
but
there
was
a
steadiness
and
persistency
to
it
that
did
not
encourage
one
in
the
belief
that
it
would
soon
stop
the
big
drops
dashed
against
the
windows
intermittently
as
the
wind
rose
and
fell
around
one
angle
of
the
house
the
gale
howled
quite
fiercely
and
in
the
parlor
where
there
was
an
open
fireplace
it
came
down
in
gusts
sighing
mournfully
out
into
the
room
with
its
old
horsehair
furniture
the
pictures
of
evidently
relatives
in
heavy
gold
frames
while
in
other
frames
were
fearfully
and
wonderfully
made
wreaths
of
flowers
wax
in
some
cases
and
cloth
in
the
remainder
being
the
medium
in
which
nature
was
rather
mocked
than
simulated
the
girls
stood
at
the
windows
staring
drearily
out
they
could
just
see
a
house
down
the
road
on
the
other
side
in
the
other
direction
no
residences
were
visible
just
an
expanse
of
fields
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
no
teams
on
the
winding
country
road
oh
but
this
is
lonesome
said
amy
with
a
sigh
girls
what
are
we
to
do
demanded
mollie
we
simply
must
go
on
to
my
sister
declared
grace
what
will
she
think
if
we
do
come
as
if
in
answer
the
storm
burst
into
another
spasm
of
fury
the
rain
coming
down
in
sheets
blankets
and
pillow
cases
as
mollie
grimly
put
it
we
can
never
go
in
this
downpour
declared
betty
it
would
be
sheer
madness
foolishness
at
any
rate
we
would
be
drenched
in
an
instant
and
perhaps
take
cold
if
there
was
only
some
way
to
let
your
sister
know
spoke
mollie
i
wonder
if
there
a
telephone
it
needed
but
a
little
survey
to
disclose
that
there
was
none
if
we
could
only
see
someone
send
for
a
covered
carriage
or
send
some
word
began
amy
oh
well
for
the
matter
of
my
sister
worrying
that
does
amount
to
much
interrupted
grace
when
i
wrote
i
told
her
it
was
not
exactly
certain
just
what
day
we
would
arrive
as
i
thought
we
might
spend
more
time
in
some
places
than
in
others
that
part
is
all
right
worrying
me
is
that
we
ca
get
to
any
place
to
spend
the
night
we
ca
have
any
supper
we
girls
cried
betty
with
sudden
resolve
there
is
only
one
thing
to
do
what
that
the
others
chorused
stay
here
we
get
supper
here
there
must
be
food
in
the
house
if
the
people
come
back
we
ask
them
to
keep
us
over
night
room
enough
and
if
they
do
come
asked
amy
shivering
a
little
then
we
stay
anyhow
cried
the
little
captain
we
are
in
charge
and
we
ca
desert
now
chapter
xviii
relieved
that
betty
suggestion
was
the
most
sensible
one
which
could
have
been
made
they
were
all
willing
to
admit
when
they
had
thought
of
it
for
a
little
while
of
course
it
is
possible
for
us
to
go
out
in
this
storm
and
tramp
on
to
broxton
said
betty
but
would
it
be
wise
indeed
not
exclaimed
grace
as
she
glanced
down
at
her
trim
suit
which
the
little
wetting
received
in
the
dash
to
the
house
had
not
spoiled
if
we
were
boys
we
might
do
it
but
as
it
is
i
wo
admit
that
we
ca
do
it
because
we
are
boys
said
betty
only
just
only
we
just
not
going
out
in
this
storm
said
mollie
decidedly
we
stay
here
and
if
the
people
come
back
and
make
a
fuss
pay
just
as
we
would
at
a
hotel
they
wo
be
mean
enough
to
turn
us
out
i
think
we
stay
and
get
supper
cried
betty
come
on
i
getting
hungrier
every
minute
if
the
people
do
come
remarked
amy
they
ought
to
allow
us
something
for
taking
care
of
their
house
i
mean
if
they
attempt
to
charge
us
as
a
hotel
would
we
can
tell
them
how
we
shut
the
windows
at
so
much
per
window
laughed
mollie
oh
you
are
the
queerest
girl
and
she
hugged
her
well
let
get
supper
proposed
betty
again
it
will
soon
be
dark
and
it
is
easy
going
about
a
strange
house
in
the
dark
there
are
lamps
said
mollie
pointing
to
several
on
a
shelf
in
the
kitchen
oh
i
did
exactly
mean
that
went
on
betty
rolling
up
her
sleeves
now
to
see
what
in
the
ice
box
at
least
i
suppose
there
is
an
ice
box
there
a
fire
in
the
stove
and
we
can
cook
oh
girls
it
going
to
be
real
jolly
after
all
and
how
it
does
rain
exclaimed
amy
we
never
could
have
gone
on
in
this
drenching
downpour
it
was
an
exceedingly
house
and
the
girls
who
had
been
wisely
trained
at
home
had
no
difficulty
in
locating
an
ample
supply
of
food
they
invaded
the
cellar
and
found
plenty
of
canned
fruit
tomatoes
and
other
things
there
were
hams
shoulders
of
bacon
eggs
and
some
fresh
meat
great
loaves
of
evidently
bread
were
in
the
pantry
we
shall
dine
like
kings
cried
grace
better
than
some
kings
said
betty
only
i
do
see
any
chocolates
grace
and
she
laughed
smarty
was
the
other
retort
but
she
laughed
also
such
a
jolly
meal
as
it
was
the
girls
once
they
had
decided
in
their
minds
to
make
the
best
of
a
queer
situation
felt
more
at
home
they
laughed
and
joked
and
when
supper
was
over
the
dishes
washed
and
the
lamps
lighted
they
gathered
in
the
parlor
and
betty
played
on
a
melodeon
that
gave
forth
rather
doleful
sounds
however
she
managed
to
extract
some
music
from
its
yellowed
keys
and
the
girls
sang
some
simple
little
too
bad
we
have
an
audience
murmured
grace
as
they
ended
up
with
my
bonnie
lies
over
the
ocean
the
rain
is
audience
enough
spoke
mollie
as
for
someone
bonnie
lying
over
the
the
yard
is
a
perfect
she
went
on
looking
from
the
window
it
would
have
been
foolish
to
go
on
said
betty
i
am
glad
we
have
such
a
comfortable
place
and
comfortable
it
certainly
was
the
house
while
a
typical
country
residence
was
very
convenient
and
well
ordered
careful
people
lived
in
it
that
was
easy
to
see
and
as
the
rain
pelted
down
the
girls
sat
about
the
cat
purring
contentedly
near
them
and
a
cheerful
fire
burning
on
the
hearth
in
the
parlor
i
hope
they
wo
make
a
fuss
about
the
liberties
we
are
taking
said
mollie
putting
some
extra
sticks
on
the
blaze
some
persons
never
open
their
parlors
in
the
country
these
people
do
seem
of
that
sort
said
amy
at
least
the
parlor
was
open
enough
when
we
closed
the
windows
and
how
it
rains
murmured
grace
with
a
little
nervous
shiver
suppose
the
people
come
back
in
the
middle
of
the
night
asked
mollie
they
think
we
are
burglars
we
must
leave
a
light
burning
decided
betty
and
a
note
near
it
explaining
why
we
came
in
and
that
we
are
asleep
upstairs
then
they
will
know
that
was
decided
on
as
the
best
plan
and
it
was
carried
out
the
girls
went
to
bed
but
it
was
some
time
before
they
got
to
sleep
though
finally
the
steady
fall
of
rain
wooed
them
to
slumber
no
one
entered
during
the
night
and
the
morning
came
still
retaining
the
rain
will
it
ever
clear
asked
mollie
hopelessly
the
wind
is
changing
spoke
betty
i
think
we
can
soon
start
but
can
we
go
away
and
leave
the
house
alone
asked
amy
ought
we
not
to
stay
until
the
owners
come
back
how
can
we
tell
when
they
will
come
back
demanded
grace
besides
i
must
let
my
sister
know
why
we
were
detained
i
suppose
we
will
have
to
go
on
said
betty
if
the
persons
living
here
did
care
about
deserting
their
place
we
ought
not
to
but
what
will
they
think
when
they
come
in
and
see
that
someone
has
been
here
asked
mollie
we
must
leave
a
note
explaining
and
also
some
money
for
the
food
we
took
decided
betty
or
we
can
stop
at
the
next
house
and
tell
how
it
was
they
debated
these
two
plans
for
some
time
finally
deciding
on
part
of
both
that
is
they
would
leave
a
note
and
a
sum
of
money
that
they
figured
would
pay
for
what
they
had
eaten
they
made
no
deduction
for
closing
the
windows
against
the
rain
they
would
also
stop
at
the
nearest
house
and
explain
matters
to
the
residents
there
asking
them
to
communicate
with
the
occupants
of
the
deserted
house
when
this
point
had
been
reached
and
when
the
note
had
been
written
and
wrapped
around
the
money
being
placed
in
a
conspicuous
place
in
the
front
hall
the
girls
were
ready
to
leave
the
rain
had
slackened
and
there
was
a
promise
of
fair
weather
breakfast
had
been
partaken
of
and
the
dishes
washed
the
house
was
as
nearly
like
it
had
been
as
was
possible
to
leave
it
well
let
start
proposed
grace
they
went
towards
the
front
door
and
as
they
opened
it
they
saw
advancing
up
the
walk
a
lady
with
a
large
umbrella
a
large
carpet
bag
wearing
a
large
bonnet
and
enveloped
in
the
folds
of
a
large
shawl
she
walked
with
determined
steps
and
as
she
came
on
she
glanced
toward
the
house
as
she
saw
the
four
girls
on
the
porch
she
quickened
her
pace
girls
we
relieved
said
betty
in
a
low
voice
here
comes
the
owner
or
i
much
mistaken
chapter
xix
a
little
lost
girl
what
are
you
doing
here
who
are
you
how
long
have
you
been
here
is
black
in
there
these
questions
were
fairly
shot
at
the
girls
who
stood
in
rather
embarrassed
silence
on
the
porch
the
sun
was
now
breaking
through
the
clouds
in
warm
splendor
and
they
took
this
for
a
good
omen
well
why
do
you
answer
demanded
the
rather
aggressive
woman
i
ca
see
what
you
are
doing
here
she
stuck
her
umbrella
in
the
soft
earth
along
the
graveled
walk
we
we
came
in
to
shut
the
windows
said
amy
gently
a
change
came
over
the
woman
face
she
frowned
she
smiled
she
turned
about
and
looked
toward
the
nearest
house
then
she
spoke
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
she
demanded
that
after
i
called
her
on
the
telephone
martha
black
did
come
over
shut
my
windows
lock
up
my
house
and
feed
the
cat
did
she
we
do
know
i
afraid
we
do
know
black
answered
betty
she
was
getting
control
of
herself
now
the
aggressive
woman
had
rather
startled
her
at
first
she
lives
down
there
and
the
owner
of
the
deserted
house
pointed
toward
the
nearest
residence
no
one
is
here
but
us
said
betty
we
closed
the
windows
and
we
fed
the
cat
we
also
fed
ourselves
but
we
left
the
money
to
pay
for
it
shall
i
get
it
the
woman
stared
at
her
blankly
i
i
afraid
i
do
understand
she
returned
weakly
i
explain
said
betty
and
she
did
telling
how
they
had
come
in
for
shelter
from
the
storm
how
they
had
found
the
windows
open
how
they
had
closed
up
the
place
and
had
eaten
and
slept
in
it
now
they
were
going
away
well
if
that
does
beat
all
cried
the
woman
in
wonder
we
could
understand
how
no
one
was
at
home
went
on
betty
well
it
easy
enough
explained
said
the
woman
i
kate
robertson
yesterday
afternoon
i
got
a
telephone
message
from
kirkville
saying
my
husband
who
works
in
the
plaster
mill
there
was
hurt
of
course
that
flustered
me
hiram
boggs
brought
the
message
of
course
you
do
know
him
no
answered
betty
as
robertson
paused
for
breath
well
i
was
flustered
of
course
naturally
went
on
the
large
lady
i
just
rushed
out
as
i
was
got
into
hiram
bogg
rig
he
drives
good
horses
i
will
say
that
for
him
i
got
in
with
him
just
as
i
was
though
i
will
say
i
had
all
my
housework
done
and
was
thinking
what
to
get
for
supper
i
got
in
with
hiram
and
made
him
drive
me
to
the
depot
i
knew
i
just
had
time
to
get
the
train
and
i
got
it
and
me
with
only
such
things
as
i
could
grab
up
she
added
with
a
glance
at
her
attire
which
though
old
fashioned
was
neat
on
my
way
to
the
station
she
resumed
i
stopped
at
the
drug
store
telephoned
to
martha
black
and
asked
her
to
run
over
and
close
up
my
house
for
it
looked
like
a
storm
it
did
rain
put
in
mollie
i
should
say
it
did
and
martha
never
closed
my
house
it
was
a
direct
question
no
we
did
said
betty
probably
she
forgot
it
i
have
to
see
well
anyhow
when
i
got
to
my
husband
i
found
he
was
much
hurt
after
all
still
i
stayed
over
night
with
him
as
there
was
a
train
back
and
when
i
saw
you
girls
on
my
porch
i
think
what
had
happened
are
you
a
votes
for
women
crowd
no
said
betty
we
a
walking
club
no
politics
none
whatever
all
right
now
then
i
see
why
martha
did
come
over
i
understand
perhaps
this
is
she
now
said
betty
as
another
woman
was
seen
coming
up
the
walk
it
is
said
robertson
that
martha
black
the
two
met
there
was
much
talk
of
which
the
girls
caught
some
and
then
the
explanation
came
black
had
started
to
come
over
to
robertson
house
to
close
the
windows
as
she
saw
the
rain
but
pausing
to
attend
to
some
household
duties
she
was
a
little
late
then
she
looked
over
and
saw
the
sashes
shut
down
and
thought
that
robertson
had
come
back
to
attend
to
them
herself
as
the
storm
kept
up
she
did
not
have
a
chance
to
call
and
only
on
seeing
robertson
arrive
did
she
suspect
anything
wrong
meanwhile
the
girls
had
been
in
charge
but
black
was
not
aware
of
it
well
i
must
say
i
thank
you
said
robertson
to
betty
and
her
chums
and
as
for
me
taking
your
money
i
never
dream
of
it
wo
you
stay
to
dinner
we
must
be
off
replied
betty
and
soon
after
more
talk
and
explanations
and
the
return
of
the
money
left
by
the
girls
in
the
hall
the
travelers
were
on
their
way
once
more
well
i
must
say
they
were
neat
and
clean
observed
robertson
as
she
went
through
her
house
real
nice
girls
but
betty
and
her
chums
did
not
hear
this
compliment
they
went
on
to
visit
the
sister
of
grace
who
was
not
greatly
alarmed
at
their
delay
though
she
was
amused
at
the
narrative
of
their
experience
they
remained
there
over
night
and
the
next
day
went
on
to
simpson
corners
where
they
were
the
guests
of
betty
uncle
this
was
a
typical
country
settlement
and
the
girls
only
remained
one
night
their
next
stopping
place
was
to
be
flatbush
where
mollie
aunt
lived
the
weather
was
fine
now
after
the
storm
and
the
roads
pleasant
through
the
country
the
grass
was
greener
than
ever
the
trees
fully
in
leaf
and
there
were
many
birds
to
be
heard
singing
save
for
minor
adventures
such
as
getting
on
the
wrong
road
once
or
twice
and
meeting
a
herd
of
cattle
which
did
them
no
harm
nothing
of
moment
occurred
to
the
girls
on
their
trip
toward
flatbush
they
had
stopped
for
lunch
in
the
little
village
of
mooretown
eating
at
the
roadside
under
some
great
oak
trees
and
making
chocolate
instead
of
tea
for
a
change
then
came
a
rest
period
before
they
went
forward
again
they
were
within
two
miles
of
their
destination
going
along
a
peaceful
country
road
arched
with
shady
trees
and
running
parallel
for
a
distance
with
a
little
river
when
betty
paused
and
called
hark
listen
someone
is
crying
gracious
i
hope
it
is
the
twins
exclaimed
mollie
out
here
never
said
grace
the
crying
increased
and
then
they
all
saw
a
little
girl
sitting
on
a
stone
under
a
tree
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
betty
hurried
up
to
the
tot
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
pillowing
the
tousled
yellow
head
on
her
arm
i
losted
sobbed
the
little
girl

and
at

the

into
a
fresh

of

the
child
pointing
in
the
direction
from

the
girls
had
come
oh

exclaimed
grace

got
to
go

the
lost
child
indicating
with
one
chubby
finger
the
other
direction
gracious

live
in
two
places
at
once
cried
mollie
what
a

confused
and
does
know
what
she

from

tot
positively
she
had
stopped
sobbing
now
and
appeared
interested
in
the
girls
mamma
carrie

and
in
quick
succession
she
pointed
first

the

oh

amy
it

she
seemed
on
the
verge
of
tears
again
here
exclaimed
grace
in
desperation
have
a
candy
do
two
of
them
but
do
cry
she
reminds
me
of
the
twins
she
added
with
just
the
suspicion
of
moisture
in
her
own
eyes
the
lost
child
gravely
accepted
two
chocolates
one
in
each
hand
and
at
once
proceeded
to
get
about
as
much
on
the
outside
of
her
face
as
went
in
her
mouth
she
seemed
more
content
now
i
ca
understand
it
sighed
mollie
two
mothers
who
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
me
got
two
muvvers
said
the
child
calmly
as
she
took
a
bite
first
of
the
chocolate
in
her
left
hand
and
then
a
nibble
from
the
one
in
the
right
one
live
dat
way
one
live
udder
way
what
can
she
be
driving
at
asked
amy
there
must
be
some
explanation
said
betty
as
she
got
up
from
the
stump
on
which
she
had
been
sitting
and
placed
the
child
on
the
ground
we
take
her
a
little
distance
on
the
way
we
are
going
she
went
on
perhaps
we
may
meet
someone
looking
for
her
and
we
ca
delay
too
long
added
mollie
it
will
soon
be
supper
time
and
my
aunt
where
we
are
going
to
stay
is
quite
a
fusser
i
sent
her
a
card
saying
we
be
there
and
if
we
do
arrive
she
may
call
up
our
houses
on
the
telephone
and
imagine
that
all
sorts
of
accidents
have
befallen
us
but
we
ca
leave
her
all
alone
on
the
road
spoke
betty
indicating
the
child
do
me
pleaded
the
lost
tot
me
want
one
of
my
muvvers
it
getting
worse
and
worse
sighed
mollie
wanting
to
laugh
but
not
daring
to
slowly
the
girls
proceeded
in
the
direction
they
had
been
going
they
hoped
they
might
meet
someone
who
either
would
be
looking
for
the
child
or
else
a
traveler
who
could
direct
them
properly
to
her
house
or
who
might
even
assume
charge
of
the
little
one
for
it
was
getting
late
and
the
girls
did
not
feel
like
spending
the
night
in
some
strange
place
it
was
practically
out
of
the
question
they
were
going
along
betty
holding
one
of
the
child
hands
the
other
small
fist
tightly
clutching
some
sticky
chocolates
when
a
turn
of
the
road
brought
the
outdoor
girls
in
sight
of
a
lad
who
was
seated
on
a
roadside
rock
tying
a
couple
of
rags
around
his
left
foot
which
was
bleeding
beside
the
boy
on
the
ground
was
a
pack
such
as
country
peddlers
often
carry
the
lad
seemed
in
pain
for
as
the
girls
approached
their
footfalls
deadened
by
the
soft
dust
of
the
road
they
heard
him
murmur
ouch
that
sure
does
hurt
it
a
bad
cut
all
right
and
i
do
see
jimmie
martin
how
you
going
to
do
much
walking
why
could
you
look
where
you
were
going
and
not
step
on
that
piece
of
glass
he
seemed
to
be
finding
fault
with
himself
gracious
exclaimed
mollie
i
hope
this
is
another
lost
one
we
seem
to
be
getting
the
habit
he
appears
able
to
look
after
himself
said
amy
the
boy
heard
their
voices
and
looked
up
quickly
then
after
a
glance
at
them
he
went
on
binding
up
his
foot
but
at
the
sight
of
him
the
little
girl
cried
oh
it
dimmie
dat
my
dimmie
he
take
me
to
my
two
muvvers
she
broke
away
from
betty
and
ran
toward
the
boy
peddler
why
it
nellie
burton
the
lad
exclaimed

the
child
as

piece
of
glass
and
it
went
right
through
my
shoe
but
it
stopped
bleeding
now
do
you
know
this
little
girl
asked
betty
we
found
her
down
the
road
but
she
ca
seem
to
tell
us
where
she
lives
first
she
points
in
one
direction
and

other
and

her
two
mothers

mollie
do

yes
answered
the
boy
peddler
and
his
voice
was
pleasant
he
took
off
a
rather
ragged
cap
politely
and
stood
up
on
one
foot
resting
the
cut
one
on
the
rock
she
nellie
burton
and
she
lives
about
a
mile
down
that
way
and
he
pointed
in
the
direction
from
which
the
girls
had
come
i
live
dere
sometimes
spoke
the
child
and
sometimes
down
dere
and
she
indicated
two
directions
i
dot
two
muvvers
what
in
the
world
does
she
mean
asked
mollie
hopelessly
that
what
she
always
says
spoke
the
boy
she
calls
one
of
her
aunts
her
mamma
it
her
mother
sister
you
see
she
lives
about
a
mile
from
nellie
house
and
nellie
spends
about
as
much
time
at
one
place
as
she
does
at
the
other
she
always
says
she
has
two
mothers
i
announced
the
child
calmly
accepting
another
chocolate
from
grace
and
you
know
nellie
asked
betty
pointedly
yes
said
the
boy
you
see
i
work
through
this
part
of
the
country
i
peddle
writing
paper
pens
pins
needles
and
notions
he
added
motioning
to
his
pack
i
often
stop
at
nellie
house
and
at
her
aunt
too
they
my
regular
customers
he
added
proudly
and
with
a
proper
regard
for
his
humble
calling
i
doing
pretty
well
too
he
went
on
i
got
a
good
trade
and
thinking
of
adding
to
it
i
take
little
nellie
back
home
for
you
he
offered
i
going
that
way
sometimes
when
i
late
as
i
am
her
mother
keeps
me
over
night
that
nice
said
betty
we
really
did
know
what
to
do
with
her
and
we
ought
to
be
in
flatbush
at
my
friend
aunt
house
and
she
indicated
mollie
will
you
go
with
your
little
friend
betty
asked
of
the
child
me
go
wif
dimmie
was
the
answer
confidently
given
dimmie
know
where
i
live
but
can
you
walk
asked
amy
as
they
all
noticed
that
the
boy
foot
was
quite
badly
cut
oh
i
guess
i
can
limp
if
i
ca
walk
he
said
bravely
if
i
had
a
bandage
i
might
tie
it
up
so
i
could
put
on
my
shoe
then
be
all
right
let
me
fix
it
exclaimed
betty
impulsively
i
know
something
about
bandaging
and
we
have
some
cloth
and
ointment
with
us
i
bandage
up
your
foot
oh
i
could
think
of
troubling
you
he
protested
i
i
guess
i
can
do
it
but
he
winced
with
pain
as
he
accidentally
hit
his
foot
on
the
stone
now
you
just
let
me
do
it
insisted
the
little
captain
you
really
must
and
you
will
have
to
walk
to
take
nellie
home
that
will
be
something
off
our
minds
maybe
we
can
get
a
lift
suggested
the
boy
often
the
farmers
let
me
ride
with
them
there
may
be
one
along
soon
let
us
hope
so
for
your
sake
as
well
as
nellie
spoke
grace
really
kind
of
you
and
quite
providential
that
we
met
you
yes
replied
the
boy
looking
from
one
pretty
girl
to
the
other
i
take
care
of
nellie
i
known
her
for
some
time
you
see
i
peddle
around
here
a
lot
my
father
dead
i
have
got
any
relatives
except
a
sick
aunt
that
i
go
to
see
once
in
a
while
and
i
in
business
for
myself
you
are
quite
a
little
soldier
complimented
betty
as
she
got
out
the
bandages
and
salve
you
are
very
brave
oh
i
have
got
any
kick
coming
he
answered
with
a
laugh
of
course
this
cut
foot
will
make
me
travel
slow
for
a
while
and
i
get
to
all
my
customers
on
time
but
i
guess
they
save
their
trade
for
me
the
regulars
will
i
might
be
worse
off
the
lad
continued
after
a
pause
i
might
be
in
as
bad
a
hole
as
that
fellow
i
saw
on
the
train
not
long
ago
how
was
that
asked
betty
more
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
rather
than
because
she
was
interested
the
boy
himself
had
carefully
washed
out
the
cut
at
a
roadside
spring
and
as
it
was
clean
the
girl
applied
the
salve
and
was
skillfully
wrapping
the
bandage
around
the
wound
what
man
was
that
she
added
why
said
the
boy
i
had
a
long
jump
to
make
from
one
town
to
another
and
as
there
were
any
customers
between
i
rode
in
the
train
the
only
other
passenger
in
our
car
was
a
young
fellow
asleep
all
of
a
sudden
he
woke
up
in
his
seat
and
begun
hunting
all
through
his
pockets
first
i
thought
he
had
lost
his
ticket
for
he
kept
hollerin
gone
i
lost
it
my
last
hope
and
all
things
like
that
i
was
to
ask
him
what
it
was
when
he
shouted
five
hundred
dollar
bill
is
gone
and
out
of
the
car
he
ran
hoppin
off
the
train
which
was
slowin
up
at
a
station
that
was
tough
luck
losin
five
hundred
dollars
of
course
i
could
do
it
for
i
never
had
it
the
boy
added
philosophically
as
he
watched
betty
adjusting
the
bandage
chapter
xxi
the
letter
the
effect
of
the
boy
words
on
the
girls
was
electrical
betty
paused
midway
in
her
work
and
stared
at
him
grace
who
had
unconsciously
perhaps
been
eating
some
of
her
chocolates
dropped
one
half
consumed
amy
looked
at
betty
to
see
what
the
little
captain
would
do
mollie
murmured
something
in
french
just
what
does
not
matter
did
did
he
really
lose
a
five
hundred
dollar
bill
faltered
betty
as
she
resumed
her
bandaging
but
her
hands
trembled
in
spite
of
herself
well
that
what
he
said
replied
the
boy
he
sure
did
make
an
awful
fuss
about
it
i
thought
he
was
crazy
at
first
and
when
he
ran
and
jumped
off
the
train
i
was
sure
of
it
did
he
get
hurt
asked
amy
breathlessly
no
not
as
i
could
see
the
train
was
slowing
up
at
a
station
you
know
i
think
it
was
batesville
but
i
not
sure
that
the
next
station
beyond
deepdale
murmured
grace
what
that
asked
the
boy
respectfully
oh
nothing
we
just
know
where
it
is
that
all
a
five
hundred
dollar
bill
fancy
she
glanced
meaningly
at
her
companions
well
that
what
he
hollered
said
the
boy
and
he
was
real
excited
too
did
you
know
him
asked
betty
as
she
finished
with
the
bandage
never
saw
him
before
nor
since
it
was
quite
some
time
ago
i
just
bought
a
new
line
of
goods
anyhow
i
glad
it
was
me
i
afford
to
lose
many
five
hundred
dollar
bills
and
he
laughed
frankly
that
about
as
much
as
i
make
in
a
year
i
mean
altogether
he
said
quickly
lest
the
girls
get
an
exaggerated
notion
of
the
peddling
business
i
ca
make
that
clear
though
i
hope
to
some
time
he
said
proudly
me
want
to
go
home
broke
in
little
nellie
me
want
my
muvvers
all
right
i
take
you
to
your
real
mother
spoke
the
boy
peddler
i
guess
i
can
walk
now
thank
you
he
said
to
betty
could
i
give
you
something
some
letter
paper
a
pencil
i
got
a
nice
line
of
pencils
he
motioned
toward
his
pack
oh
no
thank
you
exclaimed
mollie
we
are
only
too
glad
to
help
you
added
betty
you
have
done
us
a
service
in
looking
after
the
little
girl
to
say
nothing
of
the
five
hundred
dollar
bill
added
grace
in
a
low
tone
hush
cautioned
betty
in
a
whisper
do
let
him
know
anything
about
it
and
you
are
sure
you
would
know
that
man
again
asked
mollie
i
mean
the
one
you
spoke
of
well
i
know
him
if
i
saw
him
but
i
not
likely
to
he
was
tall
and
good
looking
with
a
little
black
mustache
he
got
out
of
the
train
in
a
hurry
when
he
woke
up
you
see
he
was
sitting
with
his
window
open
it
was
very
hot
he
fell
asleep
i
noticed
him
tossing
around
in
his
seat
and
every
once
in
a
while
he
would
feel
in
his
pocket
then
he
hollered
maybe
someone
robbed
him
suggested
betty
yet
in
her
heart
she
knew
the
bill
she
had
found
must
belong
to
this
unknown
young
man
the
very
man
to
whom
they
had
once
given
something
to
eat
no
one
was
in
the
car
but
him
and
me
said
the
boy
and
i
know
i
did
get
it
maybe
he
did
have
it
or
maybe
it
fell
out
of
the
window
anyhow
he
cut
up
an
awful
row
and
rushed
out
he
might
have
dreamed
it
me
want
to
go
home
whined
nellie
all
right
i
take
you
spoke
the
boy
i
can
walk
fine
now
thank
you
very
much
and
he
pulled
on
his
shoe
gingerly
enough
for
the
cut
was
no
small
one
then
shouldering
his
pack
and
taking
hold
of
hand
one
having
been
refilled
with
chocolates
by
grace
the
boy
peddler
moved
off
down
the
road
limping
the
girls
calling
out
to
him
i
hope
it
all
right
to
let
that
child
go
off
with
him
said
mollie
of
course
it
is
declared
betty
that
boy
had
the
nicest
cleanest
face
i
ever
seen
and
he
must
suffer
from
that
cut
oh
i
think
it
will
be
all
right
said
amy
you
could
trust
that
boy
i
agree
with
you
remarked
grace
fancy
him
seeing
the
man
lose
the
five
hundred
dollar
bill
we
found
she
added
do
you
think
it
the
same
one
asked
betty
i
sure
of
it
said
mollie
i
guess
i
am
too
admitted
the
little
captain
he
was
the
tramp
now
i
will
know
what
to
do
what
chorused
her
chums
let
the
railroad
company
know
about
it
they
must
have
had
some
inquiries
i
never
thought
of
that
before
look
he
is
waving
to
us
and
little
nellie
too
added
grace
the
boy
and
the
little
lost
girl
had
reached
a
turn
in
the
road
they
looked
back
to
send
a
voiceless
farewell
the
child
holding
trustingly
to
the
boy
hand
come
on
exclaimed
mollie
as
the
two
passed
from
sight
we
hardly
get
to
my
aunt
in
time
for
supper
and
they
hastened
on
somewhat
to
their
relief
they
learned
on
reaching
the
home
of
mulford
in
flatbush
mulford
being
mollie
aunt
that
the
boy
peddler
was
quite
a
and
local
character
he
was
thoroughly
honest
and
could
be
trusted
implicitly
some
time
later
the
girls
learned
from
mollie
aunt
that
the
little
lost
tot
had
reached
home
safely
and
that
the
boy
had
to
remain
at
her
house
for
a
week
to
recover
from
the
cut
on
his
foot
the
mother
of
the
lost
child
took
quite
an
interest
in
jimmie
martin
the
boy
peddler
and
looked
after
him
so
the
news
came
to
mulford
who
had
friends
acquainted
with
the
parents
of
the
child
who
insisted
she
had
two
muvvers
so
that
little
incident
ended
happily
and
once
more
the
outdoor
girls
were
left
to
pursue
their
way
as
they
had
started
out
they
stayed
a
day
with
mollie
aunt
a
rain
preventing
comfortable
progress
and
when
it
cleared
they
went
on
to
hightown
where
they
stopped
with
grace
cousin
and
now
for
the
camp
exclaimed
betty
one
morning
when
they
were
headed
for
cameron
where
a
of
ford
maintained
a
sort
of
resort
containing
bungalows
and
tents
that
he
rented
out
it
was
near
a
little
lake
and
was
a
favorite
place
in
summer
though
the
season
was
too
early
for
the
regulars
to
be
there
ford
had
written
to
harry
smith
his
and
arranged
for
the
girls
to
occupy
one
of
the
bungalows
for
several
days
smith
agreed
to
come
and
stay
with
them
as
company
though
we
do
really
need
a
chaperon
laughed
grace
i
think
we
can
look
after
ourselves
it
will
be
better
to
have
her
at
the
bungalow
said
betty
and
so
it
was
arranged
betty
had
written
to
the
railroad
company
asking
if
any
report
of
a
lost
sum
of
money
had
been
received
and
the
answer
she
got
was
to
the
contrary
that
leaves
the
five
hundred
dollar
mystery
as
deep
as
ever
she
said
showing
the
letter
to
her
chums
it
had
reached
them
at
hightown
maybe
we
should
have
told
that
boy
peddler
and
asked
him
to
be
on
the
lookout
suggested
amy
no
i
do
not
think
it
would
have
been
wise
to
let
him
have
the
facts
said
betty
the
girls
found
the
camp
in
the
woods
a
most
delightful
place
the
bungalow
was
well
arranged
and
furnished
and
though
there
were
no
other
campers
at
that
time
the
girls
did
not
mind
this
i
write
home
and
ask
will
to
come
said
grace

might
like

a
few
days
here
and
uncle
harry
said
he
could
take
a
tent
if
he
liked
ask
frank
haley

suggested
amy
and
percy

added
mollie
with
a
sly
glance

betty
quickly
how
do
you
know
she
was
challenged
he
wrote
and
then
betty
blushed
and
stopped
her
companions
laughed
and
teased
her
unmercifully
there
was
some
mail
for
the
girls
awaiting
them
at
smith
house
having
been
forwarded
from
deepdale
and
betty
letter
contained
a
surprise
among
other
things
her
mother
wrote

been
some
inquiries
made
here
about
the
five
hundred
dollar
bill
down
at
the
the
other
day
a
man
came
in
and
posted
a
notice
saying

had
lost
such
a
sum
of
money
somewhere
in
this
part
of
the
country
his
name
is
henry
blackford
and
the
address
is
somewhere
in
new
york
state
it
was
on
the
notice
but
some
mischievous
boys
got
to
skylarking
and
tore
it
off
your
father
is
going
to
look
into
the
matter
oh
maybe
he

the
owner
of
the
money

returned
betty
chapter
xxii
a
perilous
leak
the
boys
came
to
the
camp
at
cameron
will
frank
and
as
a
surprise
allen
washburn
betty
could
hardly
believe
it
when
she
saw
him
but
he
explained
that
he
had
successfully
passed
his
bar
examinations
and
felt
entitled
to
a
vacation
will
had
invited
him
on
the
receipt
of
his
sister
letter
and
we
have
some
dandy
times
exclaimed
will
what
about
the
man
looking
for
his
five
hundred
dollars
asked
grace
for
her
brother
and
the
other
boys
knew
of
the
find
and
also
of
the
notice
put
up
in
the
no
one
seems
to
know
much
about
him
said
will
when
he
had
been
told
of
nelson
letter
he
hurried
in
stuck
up
that
notice
and
hurried
out
again
then
some
kids
tore
off
the
address
he
crazy
affirmed
frank
it
does
seem
so
admitted
will
he
asked
the
postmaster
if
anyone
had
found
a
big
sum
of
money
and
of
course
rock
slow
as
he
always
is
did
think
about
the
advertisement
in
the
he
said
he
did
know
of
anyone
picking
up
a
fortune
and
the
man
hurried
off
i
must
write
to
him
if
i
can
learn
that
address
said
betty
the
weather
continued
exceptionally
fine
and
life
in
the
woods
in
the
tent
for
the
boys
and
the
bungalow
for
the
girls
was
ideal
they
stayed
there
a
week
enjoying
the
camping
novelty
to
the
utmost
at
night
they
would
gather
around
a
campfire
and
sing
sometimes
they
went
out
on
the
lake
in
a
small
launch
smith
owned
not
far
away
was
a
resort
much
frequented
by
the
summer
colonists
and
though
it
was
not
yet
in
full
swing
there
were
some
amusements
opened
these
the
young
people
enjoyed
on
several
evenings
well
i
do
hope
my
new
suitcase
comes
tomorrow
spoke
grace
for
she
had
written
for
one
to
be
forwarded
to
her
containing
fresh
garments
and
i
need
some
clothes
cried
mollie
this
walking
is
harder
on
them
than
you
think
fortunately
the
garments
came
on
time
and
in
fresh
outfits
the
girls
prepared
to
bid
farewell
to
the
camp
and
once
more
proceed
on
their
way
the
boys
begged
for
permission
to
accompany
them
but
betty
was
firm
in
refusing
we
said
we
would
make
this
tour
all
by
ourselves
she
declared
and
we
are
going
to
do
it
some
other
time
you
boys
may
come
along
but
there
is
only
another
day
or
so
and
we
will
be
back
home
please
do
tease
the
boys
did
but
that
was
all
the
good
it
availed
them
the
girls
were
obdurate
from
cameron
they
were
to
go
to
judgeville
a
thriving
town
of
about
ten
thousand
inhabitants
betty
cousin
lived
there
and
had
planned
a
round
of
gaieties
for
her
young
relative
and
friends
they
were
to
stay
three
days
and
from
there
would
keep
on
to
deepdale
thus
completing
the
circuit
they
had
mapped
out
so
far
they
had
been
very
fortunate
not
much
rain
coming
to
interfere
with
their
progress
the
morning
they
were
to
leave
camp
however
the
weather
changed
and
for
three
miserable
days
they
were
compelled
to
remain
in
the
bungalow
not
that
they
stayed
indoors
all
the
while
for
the
travelers
fully
merited
the
title
outdoor
girls
and
they
lived
up
to
it
they
tramped
even
in
the
rain
and
managed
to
have
a
good
time
but
the
rain
sent
the
boys
home
for
rain
in
a
tent
is
most
depressing
and
as
all
the
other
bungalows
were
being
repaired
they
could
not
live
in
one
with
any
comfort
but
finally
the
sun
came
out
and
the
girls
really
set
off
on
almost
the
last
stage
of
their
tour
they
expected
to
be
in
judgeville
at
night
though
the
walk
was
about
the
longest
they
had
planned
for
any
one
day
shortly
before
noon
their
way
took
them
along
a
highway
that
paralleled
the
railroad
the
same
line
that
ran
to
deepdale
and
naturally
the
talk
turned
to
the
finding
of
the
five
hundred
dollar
bill
do
you
suppose
we
ever
find
the
owner
asked
mollie
of
course
we
will
exclaimed
betty
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
once
or
twice
amy
looked
back
down
the
railroad
track
and
grace
noticing
this
in
the
intervals
of
eating
chocolate
finally
asked
what
is
it
amy
that
man
replied
the
quiet
girl
he
been
following
us
for
some
time
following
us
cried
betty
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
walking
along
the
railroad
track
back
of
us
well
that
may
not
mean
he
is
following
us
probably
he
wants
to
get
somewhere
and
the
track
is
the
shortest
route
he
looking
down
as
though
searching
for
something
said
mollie
maybe
he
a
suggested
amy
no
he
is
dressed
like
that
asserted
betty
she
turned
and
looked
at
the
man
he
seemed
young
and
had
a
face
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
girls
but
walked
on
with
head
bent
down
we
must
soon
stop
for
lunch
proposed
mollie
i
have
not
left
it
behind
this
time
and
she
held
out
the
small
suitcase
that
contained
the
provisions
put
up
that
morning
i
just
dying
for
a
cup
of
chocolate
we
will
eat
soon
said
betty
there
a
nice
place
just
beyond
that
trestle
and
she
pointed
to
a
railroad
bridge
that
crossed
a
small
but
deep
stream
the
highway
passing
over
it
by
another
and
lower
structure
as
the
girls
hurried
on
the
man
passed
them
off
to
the
left
and
high
on
the
railroad
embankment
he
gave
them
not
a
glance
but
hastened
on
with
head
bent
low
when
he
reached
the
middle
of
the
high
railroad
bridge
or
trestle
over
the
stream
he
paused
stooped
down
and
seemed
to
be
tying
his
shoelace
the
girls
watched
him
idly
suddenly
the
roar
of
an
approaching
train
was
heard
the
man
looked
up
seemed
startled
and
then
began
to
run
toward
the
end
of
the
bridge
it
was
a
long
structure
and
a
high
one
and
ere
he
had
taken
a
dozen
steps
over
the
ties
the
train
swept
into
sight
around
a
curve
the
road
was
a
one
and
on
the
narrow
trestle
there
was
no
room
for
a
person
to
avoid
the
cars
he
be
killed
cried
mollie
fascinated
the
girls
looked
on
came
the
thundering
train
the
whistle
blew
shrilly
the
young
man
increased
his
pace
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
could
not
get
off
the
bridge
in
time
realizing
this
he
paused
coming
to
the
edge
of
the
ties
on
the
bridge
he
poised
himself
for
a
moment
and
with
a
glance
at
the
approaching
locomotive
which
was
now
whistling
continuously
the
man
leaped
into
the
stream
below
him
oh
screamed
grace
and
then
she
and
the
others
looked
on
almost
horrified
as
the
body
shot
downward
illustration
the
man
leaped
into
the
stream
chapter
xxiii
the
man
story
there
was
a
great
splash
and
the
man
disappeared
under
the
water
it
all
occurred
suddenly
and
the
man
must
have
made
up
his
mind
quickly
that
he
had
not
a
chance
to
stay
on
the
trestle
when
the
train
passed
over
it
he
be
killed
cried
mollie
oh
betty
what
can
we
do
nothing
if
he
really
is
killed
answered
the
practical
little
captain
but
he
jumped
like
a
man
who
knew
how
to
do
it
and
how
to
dive
the
water
is
deep
there
come
on
cried
amy
for
once
taking
the
initiative
and
she
darted
toward
the
bank
of
the
stream
there
he
is
cried
betty
he
come
up
as
she
spoke
the
man
head
bobbed
into
view
and
giving
himself
a
shake
to
rid
his
eyes
of
water
he
struck
out
for
the
shore
oh
he
swimming
he
swimming
mollie
exclaimed
we
must
get
him
a
rope
a
plank
anything
we
help
you
she
called
and
she
ran
about
almost
hysterically
the
man
was
now
swimming
with
long
even
strokes
he
seemed
at
home
in
the
water
even
with
his
clothes
on
and
the
long
jump
had
evidently
not
injured
him
in
the
least
he
reached
the
bank
climbed
up
and
stood
dripping
before
the
four
young
travelers
whew
he
gasped
taking
off
his
coat
and
wringing
some
water
from
it
that
was
some
jump
i
had
to
do
it
though
indeed
you
were
fortunate
said
betty
are
you
hurt
not
a
bit
a
little
shaken
up
that
all
i
should
not
have
been
on
that
bridge
as
a
section
hand
warned
me
a
train
was
due
and
the
trestle
is
very
narrow
but
i
was
taking
a
short
cut
railroads
seem
to
bring
me
bad
luck
this
is
the
second
time
in
a
little
while
that
i
had
trouble
on
this
same
line
grace
was
rummaging
about
in
the
valise
she
carried
where
our
alcohol
stove
she
demanded
of
mollie
why
what
do
you
want
of
it
i
going
to
make
him
a
cup
of
hot
chocolate
he
must
need
it
poor
fellow
i
help
you
said
mollie
and
the
two
set
up
the
little
heating
apparatus
in
the
lee
of
a
big
rock
are
you
sure
you
not
hurt
asked
betty
anxiously
oh
i
all
right
the
man
assured
the
girls
i
wish
i
had
some
dry
clothes
this
is
about
the
only
suit
i
have
however
the
sun
will
soon
dry
them
but
they
need
pressing
we
making
you
some
chocolate
spoke
grace
it
will
be
ready
soon
and
keep
you
from
getting
cold
the
man
he
was
young
and
smiled
showing
his
even
white
teeth
you
seemed
prepared
for
emergencies
he
said
to
betty
are
you
professional
travelers
just
on
a
walking
tour
we
from
deepdale
we
going
home
after
stopping
over
night
in
judgeville
we
were
just
going
to
get
our
lunch
when
we
saw
you
jump
indeed
remarked
the
young
man
who
was
now
wringing
out
his
vest
from
deepdale
eh
i
been
through
there
on
the
train
this
line
runs
there
does
it
and
he
motioned
to
the
one
he
had
so
hastily
left
yes
answered
betty
but
we
never
walk
the
track
though
we
did
once
for
a
short
distance
and
we
found
a
broken
rail
and
told
a
flagman
and
he
said
the
train
might
have
been
wrecked
remarked
amy
it
was
the
first
she
had
spoken
in
some
time
the
young
man
looked
at
her
sharply
rather
too
long
a
look
betty
thought
but
there
was
nothing
impertinent
in
it
railroads
or
rather
this
one
have
been
the
cause
of
two
unpleasant
experiences
to
me
the
young
man
went
on
i
was
nearly
injured
just
now
and
not
long
ago
i
lost
quite
a
sum
of
money
on
this
line
at
the
mention
of
money
betty
started
the
others
looked
at
her
how
did
it
happen
asked
betty
and
then
of
a
sudden
she
stared
at
the
young
man
excuse
me
but
but
have
we
met
before
she
stammered
sure
he
answered
readily
you
young
ladies
were
kind
enough
to
share
your
lunch
with
me
one
day
oh
cried
mollie
but
you
you
looked
different
then
you
had
a
mustache
and
long
hair
murmured
amy
that
right
so
i
did
but
i
had
my
hair
cut
day
before
yesterday
and
the
mustache
taken
off
changes
me
quite
a
lot
does
it
yes
replied
betty
but
you
were
saying
something
about
losing
money
on
this
line
she
added
quickly
well
i
was
on
my
way
to
new
york
expecting
to
complete
a
business
deal
i
fell
asleep
in
the
car
for
i
was
quite
tired
and
i
guess
i
had
been
thinking
pretty
hard
on
that
business
matter
you
see
a
fellow
offered
me
an
option
on
a
small
but
good
concern
for
four
hundred
dollars
i
knew
if
i
could
clinch
the
deal
and
get
the
option
that
some
friends
of
mine
would
invest
in
it
and
i
have
a
good
thing
for
myself
well
as
i
say
i
fell
asleep
then
i
dreamed
someone
was
trying
to
get
my
pocketbook
it
was
a
sort
of
nightmare
and
i
guess
i
struggled
with
the
then
all
of
a
sudden
i
woke
up
and
was
your
pocketbook
gone
asked
mollie
no
but
my
money
was
and
that
was
the
funny
part
of
it
how
anyone
could
get
the
money
without
taking
the
pocketbook
i
could
see
and
there
was
anyone
in
the
car
with
me
but
a
boy
a
peddler
i
think
he
was
the
girls
looked
at
each
other
matters
were
beginning
to
fit
together
most
strangely
i
did
know
what
to
do
the
young
man
went
on
i
did
want
to
say
anything
that
would
seem
as
if
i
accused
the
boy
and
i
felt
the
same
about
the
trainmen
i
knew
if
i
said
the
money
had
been
taken
and
the
pocketbook
left
they
would
only
laugh
at
me
i
was
all
knocked
out
and
hardly
knew
what
i
was
doing
i
jumped
off
the
train
and
went
back
over
the
line
thinking
the
bill
might
have
blown
out
of
the
window
but
that
is
just
what
did
happen
cried
betty
what
that
the
man
exclaimed
excitedly
i
say
that
is
exactly
what
happened
went
on
the
little
captain
at
least
that
is
how
i
account
for
it
what
sort
of
a
bill
did
you
lose
asked
mollie
trying
not
to
get
excited
it
was
one
of
five
hundred
dollars
and
did
it
have
a
anything
pinned
to
it
exclaimed
betty
it
did
a
note
wait
i
can
tell
you
what
it
said
on
it
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
repeated
word
for
word
the
writing
on
the
note
pinned
to
the
bill
the
girls
had
picked
up
but
i
do
see
how
you
know
this
he
added
wonderingly
we
know
because
we
found
your
five
hundred
dollar
bill
exclaimed
betty
chapter
xxiv
by
telegraph
the
man
stared
at
the
girls
as
if
he
could
not
believe
what
betty
had
said
a
strange
look
came
over
his
face
if
this
is
a
joke
please
drop
it
he
began
i
am
almost
crazy
as
it
is
i
do
know
what
i
am
doing
i
it
is
a
joke
declared
betty
it
may
sound
strange
but
it
all
true
we
did
find
your
bill
under
the
railroad
bridge
in
deepdale
in
my
father
safe
now
that
great
it
fine
i
given
it
up
long
ago
i
advertised
and
put
up
a
notice
in
the
and
yes
my
mother
wrote
me
about
it
said
betty
but
she
did
not
give
your
address
for
some
naughty
boys
tore
it
off
the
notice
and
do
you
really
think
someone
tried
to
rob
you
asked
mollie
i
do
know
what
to
think
frankly
admitted
the
young
man
there
was
a
boy
in
the
same
car
he
never
took
it
exclaimed
grace
how
do
you
know
the
young
man
asked
because
we
met
that
boy
and
he
told
us
just
how
you
acted
when
you
discovered
your
loss
besides
that
boy
is
thoroughly
honest
say
is
there
anything
about
my
case
that
you
girls
do
know
asked
the
young
man
with
a
smile
but
before
i
go
any
further
perhaps
i
had
better
introduce
myself
oh
we
know
your
name
exclaimed
betty
you
do
and
you
never
saw
me
before
you
forget
that
your
name
was
signed
to
the
notice
in
the
blackford
and
betty
blushed
that
so
but
i
do
know
your
names
and
if
it
not
too
impertinent
after
the
service
you
have
rendered
me
we
tell
you
certainly
interrupted
betty
and
she
introduced
herself
and
her
chums
i
suppose
you
will
wonder
how
i
played
the
part
of
a
tramp
said
the
young
man
i
will
tell
you
why
i
was
almost
out
of
my
mind
and
i
imagined
that
by
going
around
looking
ragged
i
might
pick
up
some
news
of
my
lost
money
from
the
tramps
along
the
railroad
then
he
told
of
how
he
had
started
to
write
a
letter
stating
he
could
not
buy
the
business
he
was
after
and
had
then
torn
the
letter
up
because
he
still
hoped
to
find
the
bill
and
get
control
of
the
business
and
we
found
part
of
that
letter
cried
betty
we
tried
to
find
you
too
but
you
had
disappeared
indeed
i
know
how
that
happened
i
took
a
short
cut
through
the
woods
the
chocolate
is
ready
called
grace
a
little
later
wo
you
have
some
mr
blackford
thank
you
i
will
say
but
you
young
ladies
are
all
right
do
you
do
this
sort
of
thing
often
well
we
like
to
be
outdoors
explained
betty
as
she
handed
him
a
cup
of
the
hot
beverage
we
like
to
take
long
walks
but
this
is
the
first
time
we
ever
went
on
a
tour
like
this
and
we
had
the
time
exclaimed
mollie
and
adventures
added
grace
will
you
have
more
chocolate
no
thank
you
that
was
fine
now
i
must
try
and
get
dry
but
i
used
to
this
sort
of
thing
i
from
the
west
and
i
been
in
more
than
one
flood
you
have
cried
amy
and
the
others
knew
of
what
she
was
thinking
her
own
case
i
hope
he
did
have
the
same
sort
of
trouble
i
had
though
she
thought
perhaps
if
you
were
to
walk
along
your
clothes
would
dry
quicker
said
betty
and
if
you
went
on
to
judgeville
you
might
be
able
to
get
a
tailor
to
press
them
thanks
i
believe
i
will
that
is
if
you
do
mind
being
seen
with
such
a
disreputable
figure
as
i
cut
of
course
we
do
mind
declared
betty
we
are
getting
rather
ourselves
our
trunks
will
be
waiting
for
us
at
your
cousin
house
betty
spoke
grace
for
it
was
there
they
were
to
spend
the
last
night
of
their
now
nearly
finished
tour
we
can
freshen
up
went
on
the
girl
who
loved
candy
and
enter
into
town
in
style
i
hope
mamma
put
in
my
new
gown
and
another
pair
of
shoes
grace
ford
you
do
mean
that
you
put
on
a
new
dress
to
finish
up
this
walking
excursion
in
do
you
asked
mollie
certainly
i
shall
we
do
know
who
we
might
meet
as
we
get
into
deepdale
we
will
hardly
get
in
before
dusk
said
betty
from
judgeville
there
is
the
longest
stretch
of
all
nearly
miles
oh
dear
groaned
grace
we
never
do
it
why
did
you
arrange
for
such
a
long
walk
betty
i
could
help
it
there
were
no
other
relatives
available
and
i
could
have
any
made
to
order
there
was
no
stopping
place
between
here
and
home
oh
i
dare
say
i
can
stand
it
murmured
grace
but
i
guess
i
wear
my
new
shoes
in
that
case
miles
it
is
quite
a
stretch
said
blackford
he
helped
grace
put
away
the
alcohol
stove
and
the
cups
in
which
the
chocolate
had
been
served
they
were
washed
in
the
little
stream
and
would
be
cleansed
again
at
the
house
of
betty
cousin
you
have
asked
us
when
we
are
going
to
give
you
that
five
hundred
dollar
bill
said
mollie
as
they
started
for
judgeville
well
spoke
blackford
with
a
laugh
i
did
want
to
seem
too
anxious
i
knew
that
it
was
safe
where
you
had
put
it
miss
nelson
and
he
looked
at
betty
besides
i
have
been
without
it
so
long
now
that
it
seems
almost
as
if
i
never
had
it
and
from
all
the
good
it
is
going
to
do
me
perhaps
i
might
be
better
off
without
it
now
we
did
exactly
understand
what
you
meant
by
the
note
you
wrote
said
betty
well
i
tell
you
how
that
was
he
said
frankly
you
see
i
was
left
considerable
money
by
a
rich
relative
but
i
had
bad
luck
maybe
i
did
have
a
good
business
head
either
anyhow
i
lost
sum
after
sum
in
investments
that
did
pan
out
and
in
businesses
that
failed
i
got
down
to
my
last
big
bill
and
then
i
heard
of
this
little
business
i
could
get
control
of
in
new
york
i
said
i
make
that
my
last
venture
and
to
remind
myself
how
desperate
my
chances
were
i
just
jotted
down
those
words
and
pinned
the
note
to
the
bill
then
i
must
have
gotten
excited
in
my
dream
i
know
just
before
i
fell
asleep
i
kept
taking
the
bill
out
of
the
pocketbook
and
looking
at
it
to
make
sure
i
had
it
i
might
have
done
that
while
half
asleep
and
it
blew
out
of
the
window
that
how
it
probably
happened
and
you
girls
picked
up
the
money
i
ca
thank
you
enough
but
i
afraid
it
will
come
to
me
too
late
to
use
as
i
had
intended
the
man
went
on
with
a
sigh
why
asked
betty
because
the
option
on
the
business
i
was
going
to
buy
expires
at
midnight
and
as
you
say
the
five
hundred
dollars
is
in
deepdale
i
do
see
how
i
am
going
to
get
it
in
time
to
be
of
any
service
is
that
too
bad
cried
amy
and
we
might
have
brought
it
with
us
said
mollie
only
we
did
think
it
would
be
wise
to
carry
that
sum
with
us
spoke
grace
and
we
never
thought
the
owner
of
it
would
jump
off
a
railroad
trestle
right
in
front
of
us
she
added
with
a
laugh
no
of
course
not
admitted
blackford
drily
you
could
foresee
that
neither
could
i
well
it
ca
be
helped
maybe
it
will
be
for
the
best
in
the
end
i
have
the
five
hundred
anyhow
and
perhaps
i
can
find
some
other
business
but
i
did
want
to
get
this
one
on
which
i
had
the
option
however
there
no
help
for
it
a
sudden
light
of
resolve
came
into
betty
eyes
she
confronted
the
owner
of
the
bill
there
no
need
for
you
to
lose
your
option
she
exclaimed
but
i
do
see
how
i
can
get
the
money
in
time
i
might
if
i
had
an
airship
but
to
go
to
deepdale
and
then
to
new
york
with
it
is
out
of
the
question
no
cried
betty
we
can
do
it
by
telegraph
i
just
thought
of
a
way
out
you
can
take
up
that
option
yet
mr
blackford
chapter
xxv
back
home
betty
nelson
chums
stared
at
her
so
did
blackford
betty
herself
with
flushed
cheeks
and
flashing
eyes
looked
at
them
all
in
turn
her
idea
had
stimulated
her
what
how
i
do
see
stammered
blackford
if
you
it
this
way
cried
betty
all
enthusiasm
you
know
you
can
transfer
money
by
telegraph
in
a
very
short
time
it
only
takes
a
few
minutes
to
do
it
really
it
quicker
than
an
airship
and
she
smiled
at
blackford
that
so
he
admitted
i
see
now
i
have
my
father
telegraph
the
five
hundred
dollars
to
me
at
judgeville
explained
betty
then
i
can
give
it
to
you
and
you
can
telegraph
it
to
your
business
man
in
new
york
it
is
sure
to
reach
there
before
midnight
and
you
can
take
up
your
option
if
that
is
the
proper
term
it
is
very
proper
said
blackford
i
believe
you
have
the
right
idea
miss
nelson
i
should
have
thought
of
that
myself
but
that
shows
i
am
really
not
a
good
business
man
now
let
hurry
on
to
town
proceeded
betty
we
have
any
too
much
time
it
was
rather
an
astonished
telegraph
operator
who
a
little
later
was
confronted
by
four
pretty
girls
a
man
who
looked
as
if
he
had
been
in
a
shipwreck
and
a
lady
the
latter
was
betty
cousin
at
whose
house
the
girls
had
stopped
it
was
necessary
for
the
recipient
of
the
money
to
be
identified
and
this
betty
cousin
who
knew
the
operator
agreed
to
look
after
there
was
a
little
delay
but
not
much
and
soon
blackford
was
in
a
position
to
take
up
his
option
a
local
bank
where
the
telegraph
concern
did
business
paid
over
the
five
hundred
in
cash
and
four
hundred
of
this
was
at
once
sent
on
to
new
york
by
telegraph
i
hope
it
reaches
my
man
said
blackford
i
have
told
him
to
wire
me
here
a
little
later
word
was
received
that
the
transaction
had
been
successfully
carried
out
blackford
could
now
get
control
of
the
business
and
it
all
due
to
you
young
ladies
he
said
gratefully
i
know
how
to
thank
you
you
are
entitled
to
a
reward
do
you
dare
mention
it
cried
betty
well
some
day
i
pay
you
back
for
all
you
did
for
me
he
exclaimed
warmly
i
wo
forget
and
now
that
i
have
some
money
to
spare
going
to
get
a
new
suit
of
clothes
he
said
to
the
girls
promising
to
see
them
again
some
time
and
then
he
left
having
made
arrangements
to
go
on
to
new
york
and
finish
up
his
business
affairs
well
now
that
it
is
all
over
wo
you
come
on
to
the
house
and
have
supper
said
betty
cousin
as
they
came
out
of
the
telegraph
office
i
must
say
you
girls
know
how
to
do
things
oh
you
can
always
trust
betty
for
that
said
mollie
it
just
did
itself
declared
betty
everything
seemed
to
work
out
of
its
own
accord
from
the
time
we
found
the
five
hundred
dollar
bill
but
you
helped
a
lot
insisted
amy
indeed
she
did
added
grace
well
our
walking
tour
will
soon
be
over
betty
said
as
they
neared
her
cousin
house
we
be
home
we
had
lots
of
fun
and
i
think
it
has
done
us
all
good
we
soon
be
home
but
not
without
a
long
walk
said
grace
with
a
sigh
i
wonder
what
we
shall
do
next
we
must
keep
out
of
doors
we
have
a
long
vacation
before
us
all
summer
said
amy
i
do
wish
we
could
spend
it
together
maybe
we
can
said
betty
we
see
and
how
the
four
chums
enjoyed
the
vacation
that
was
opening
may
be
learned
by
reading
the
next
volume
of
this
series
which
will
be
entitled
the
outdoor
girls
at
rainbow
lake
or
the
stirring
cruise
of
the
motor
boat
the
stay
of
the
girls
at
the
home
of
betty
cousin
was
most
enjoyable
they
remained
two
nights
instead
of
one
sending
word
of
the
change
of
their
plans
to
their
parents
then
early
in
the
morning
they
started
for
home
on
the
last
stage
of
their
tour
miles
sighed
grace
as
they
set
out
oh
dear
but
they
were
not
destined
to
walk
all
the
way
about
five
miles
from
town
they
saw
a
big
touring
car
approaching
and
as
it
neared
them
they
beheld
will
ford
and
his
chum
frank
in
it
hurray
cried
grace
brother
welcome
to
our
city
added
frank
get
in
and
we
take
you
home
in
style
oh
you
boys
cried
betty
but
she
and
the
others
got
in
off
they
started
all
of
them
seemingly
talking
at
once
and
in
a
short
time
they
arrived
at
deepdale
they
attracted
considerable
attention
as
they
passed
through
the
town
in
the
car
will
and
frank
had
hired
to
honor
the
members
of
the
camping
and
tramping
club
but
it
rather
spoiled
our
record
i
think
said
betty
we
were
to
walk
all
the
way
oh
we
walked
enough
declared
grace
i
did
anyhow
and
she
glanced
at
her
shoes
but
it
was
fun
exclaimed
amy
glorious
cried
mollie
a
little
later
the
four
tourists
were
warmly
welcomed
at
their
respective
homes
later
meeting
for
a
general
jollification
at
mollie
house
oh
you
dears
cried
betty
trying
to
caress
the
twins
paul
and
dodo
both
at
once
and
we
saw
the
dearest
little
lost
girl
shall
i
tell
you
about
her
dive
us
tum
tandy
fust
said
dodo
fastening
her
big
eyes
on
grace
us
tandy
do
us
paul
us
do
was
the
gurgling
answer
and
grace
brought
out
her
confections
and
now
that
the
four
girls
are
safely
at
home
again
we
will
take
leave
of
them
