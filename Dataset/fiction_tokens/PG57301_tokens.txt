j
to
my

thy
heart
will
read
what

do

therefore
dear
heart
this
book
is
most
for
thee
the
luck
of
the
dudley
grahams
new
york
wednesday
november
we
are
the
dudley
grahams
children
and
a
mother
we
are
very
poor
and
keep
a
not
because
we
like
boarders
but
because
when
dear
father
died
a
three
thousand
dollar
life
assurance
and
this
house
were
our
only
assets
as
uncle
george
who
was
executor
explained
so
you
must
take
we
do
but
it
always
pleasant
the
three
thousand
dollars
did
not
last
long
either
for
there
were
a
great
many
debts
to
be
met
that
nobody
had
known
anything
about
and
we
had
to
have
the
library
repapered
and
a
new
carpet
in
the
hall
to
impress
the
people
who
came
to
look
for
rooms
must
be
very
polite
and
charming
too
said
ernie
talk
as
hard
as
we
can
all
the
time
and
then
perhaps
they
notice
how
shabby
the
rest
of
the
things
but
i
fancy
they
did
because
it
was
over
two
months
before
we
could
get
anybody
to
stop
with
us
and
the
money
in
the
bank
grew
less
and
less
while
uncle
george
grew
more
grim
and
disapproving
and
said
that
dear
father
had
been
careless
and
that
no
man
should
be
permitted
to
have
a
family
if
he
did
not
know
enough
to
provide
for
it
but
at
last
miss
brown
came
and
then
hudson
and
the
hancocks
and
now
we
are
really
beginning
to
get
along
father
was
uncle
only
brother
he
was
an
inventor
and
a
true
genius
but
unfortunately
nobody
ever
discovered
this
except
just
us
he
knew
all
about
the
contractile
bladders
of
fish
and
the
flight
of
birds
there
is
a
great
ghostly
in
the
workshop
in
the
attic
with
dusty
yellow
sails
and
a
really
wonderful
motor
haze
who
sleeps
in
the
workshop
since
he
was
obliged
to
give
up
his
room
to
the
boarders
often
dreams
that
he
is
taking
trips
at
night
he
says
the
dreams
are
quite
horrible
and
calls
them
but
if
only
dear
father
had
lived
to
perfect
the
machine
we
are
sure
it
would
have
been
a
success
and
that
would
have
been
so
pleasant
for
father
never
had
any
successes
except
just
once
we
did
not
profit
by
as
i
will
tell
later
haze
is
my
chum
he
is
fifteen
and
i
am
seventeen
but
sometimes
we
feel
a
hundred
because
there
are
so
many
things
to
worry
about
dearest
mother
never
worries
she
is
too
irish
for
that
she
cares
for
she
says
is
that
her
children
shall
be
happy
and
good
and
clever
and
have
everything
they
want
somehow
she
seems
to
believe
that
we
are
what
she
wishes
us
to
be
too
that
one
would
feel
ashamed
to
appear
discontented
but
oh
if
you
love
your
family
the
way
i
do
it
is
hard
hard
hard
to
be
poor
however
to
return
to
our
this
instance
haze
real
name
is
john
hazard
though
he
is
never
called
john
or
jack
only
hazard
or
haze
or
hazey
especially
the
last
two
because
they
fit
so
well
for
though
he
is
very
clever
and
half
through
high
school
already
he
is
not
a
bit
practical
never
sees
what
goes
on
about
him
and
is
always
forgetting
things
he
does
not
care
about
athletics
either
he
the
build
he
says
his
legs
being
too
thin
nor
the
time
nor
the
money
he
is
in
his
junior
year
this
term
the
youngest
in
his
class
and
at
present
he
is
cramming
like
mad
so
that
he
can
take
the
final
examinations
next
fall
and
to
help
the
that
means
giving
up
college
his
fondest
dream
it
is
mighty
noble
of
hazey
but
i
must
confess
not
at
all
becoming
his
face
seems
to
grow
smaller
day
by
day
and
his
eyes
behind
his
goggly
glasses
bigger
dear
haze
he
even
have
time
to
talk
to
me
any
more
and
that
is
why
i
thought
of
starting
a
diary
my
cousin
meta
has
kept
one
for
over
a
year
dainty
little
volume
with
gold
clasps
and
a
red
morocco
binding
this
is
just
an
ugly
old
account
book
of
that
i
found
in
the
workshop
the
first
few
pages
are
full
of
the
most
amazing
aërial
computations
but
there
is
plenty
of
room
left
for
writing
one
must
have
somebody
to
confide
in
after
hazard
comes
ernestine
she
is
twelve
and
is
frequently
called
ernie
name
suits
her
just
as
well
as
names
do
him
for
she
is
really
more
of
a
boy
than
a
girl
we
think
despite
her
charming
blue
eyes
and
complexion
ernie
is
very
very
pretty
has
sweet
ways
and
a
really
lovely
disposition
but
for
all
this
she
is
rather
a
trying
child
for
she
is
continually
getting
into
scrapes
tearing
her
frocks
breaking
the
furniture
she
always
means
so
well
that
it
is
hard
to
scold
her
geof
is
chum
just
as
hazard
is
mine
he
is
uncle
son
but
so
much
more
like
a
brother
than
a
cousin
that
i
am
going
to
describe
him
here
he
is
fourteen
years
old
and
the
direct
opposite
of
haze
in
nearly
every
way
he
is
a
handsome
fellow
big
for
his
age
and
rather
sullen
sometimes
that
i
think
is
because
he
is
not
happier
at
home
he
goes
to
a
fashionable
school
plays
football
and
hockey
and
is
perfectly
hopeless
in
his
studies
uncle
george
maintains
he
do
better
if
he
would
aunt
adelaide
who
is
stepmother
says
it
is
a
case
of
mother
thinks
neither
is
right
and
that
there
is
something
radically
wrong
with
the
school
methods
altogether
it
is
not
pleasant
for
geof
who
wants
to
give
up
studying
and
go
into
business
this
enrages
hazard
fellow
with
chances
he
says
swap
them
for
yours
answers
geof
who
is
not
brilliant
at
an
argument
and
haze
snorts
derisively
after
ernie
comes
robin
he
is
six
and
our
baby
he
has
never
been
strong
because
when
he
was
a
tiny
mite
of
a
thing
a
careless
nurse
dropped
him
and
injured
his
hip
he
has
bright
dark
eyes
and
you
can
always
tell
when
he
is
coming
by
the
little
hopping
sound
he
makes
with
his
crutch
it
reminds
one
of
a
bird
so
his
name
suits
him
too
i
love
robin
better
than
anything
in
the
world
and
i
am
never
going
to
marry
so
that
i
can
stay
with
him
and
take
care
of
him
always
but
this
is
a
secret
and
that
including
mother
whom
one
describe
because
she
is
too
wonderful
is
all
there
are
of
us
except
the
kitten
which
is
black
and
is
named
rosebud
and
the
cook
who
is
also
black
and
is
named
rose
of
course
we
did
not
name
the
kitten
after
the
cook
it
just
happened
that
way
as
to
uncle
family
we
call
the
george
grahams
are
very
wealthy
and
have
a
beautiful
house
and
horses
and
plenty
of
servants
but
we
would
not
change
with
them
no
indeed
when
uncle
george
comes
to
visit
us
of
a
sunday
morning
as
he
sometimes
does
to
see
how
we
are
getting
on
he
is
sure
to
stand
in
the
middle
of
our
shabby
back
parlour
and
puff
out
his
cheeks
and
throw
out
his
chest
and
say
pretend
to
be
a
man
of
genius
like
your
father
i
went
into
business
at
fifteen
years
of
age
pegged
away
a
good
forty
years
since
then
and
i
guess
managed
to
get
pretty
much
what
i
want
out
of
the
world
talent
pay
sir
no
sir
common
sense
that
aunt
adelaide
who
is
uncle
second
wife
is
handsome
and
fashionable
she
was
a
widow
with
one
daughter
when
uncle
george
married
her
so
you
see
that
meta
is
really
no
relation
to
either
geof
or
ourselves
she
is
six
months
older
than
i
and
she
and
geof
do
not
get
along
so
very
well
she
thinks
him
stupid
because
he
does
not
like
the
things
she
likes
and
he
thinks
her
silly
and
affected
i
am
afraid
she
sometimes
is
georgie
is
both
meta
and
he
is
a
little
younger
than
our
robin
he
has
very
rosy
cheeks
and
beautiful
clothes
and
expensive
toys
once
when
he
was
sick
for
two
weeks
with
german
measles
a
trained
nurse
was
engaged
and
he
had
chicken
broth
and
oranges
every
day
sometimes
i
hate
georgie
is
wicked
uncle
george
is
devoted
to
his
family
after
his
own
fashion
and
does
not
spare
any
expense
where
they
are
concerned
though
he
himself
dresses
plainly
and
never
gives
anything
in
charity
he
says
he
does
not
believe
in
it
that
no
one
ever
gave
anything
to
him
one
day
when
he
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
our
parlour
with
his
cheeks
puffed
out
as
usual
robin
who
had
been
sitting
in
the
window
turning
the
pages
of
an
animal
looked
up
you
ever
wish
you
were
a
camel
uncle
george
he
asked
i
say
i
ever
did
answered
uncle
george
condescendingly
should
i
now
would
be
so
much
easier
for
you
to
get
into
heaven
chirped
robin
and
after
a
minute
when
uncle
george
had
thought
it
over
and
began
to
understand
he
laughed
and
really
felt
rather
flattered
dear
father
was
so
different
i
said
i
would
tell
about
his
one
success
and
how
we
did
not
profit
by
it
as
we
should
it
was
a
great
pity
because
most
of
the
problems
father
worked
on
had
no
market
value
at
all
was
too
brilliant
to
find
it
easy
to
consider
commercial
interests
but
this
was
different
quite
sellable
and
practical
mechanical
attachment
for
how
ever
father
came
to
think
of
it
he
admitted
that
he
did
not
know
he
quite
despised
it
and
was
really
rather
ashamed
even
to
explain
the
way
it
worked
but
he
made
up
his
mind
that
for
once
a
little
money
would
be
nice
so
he
took
the
model
to
uncle
george
and
asked
for
a
loan
but
uncle
own
affairs
were
rather
involved
just
at
that
time
and
besides
he
said
he
did
not
care
for
investments
of
such
a
nature
he
never
had
much
faith
in
father
after
that
father
was
introduced
to
perry
a
lawyer
and
promoter
and
a
partnership
was
arranged
between
them
by
which
father
was
to
receive
down
and
in
one
time
five
per
cent
of
whatever
income
the
invention
continued
to
realize
the
contract
was
drawn
up
for
father
read
it
aloud
to
us
one
day
at
the
lunch
table
go
around
to
this
afternoon
he
said
get
this
thing
settled
and
off
my
we
were
all
quite
excited
for
it
was
a
long
time
since
we
had
had
anything
to
spend
i
remember
we
sat
in
the
in
the
and
planned
our
winter
ernie
and
nearly
two
hours
however
we
none
of
us
saw
father
when
he
came
home
he
went
directly
to
his
workshop
and
about
ten
minutes
later
as
rose
was
passing
the
door
she
thought
she
heard
him
call
so
she
peeped
in
and
saw
him
standing
supporting
himself
with
one
hand
on
the
table
he
tried
to
speak
but
could
only
groan
and
the
next
instant
he
fell
to
the
floor
dear
father
it
all
seems
like
yesterday
now
that
i
write
it
rose
gave
the
alarm
somehow
we
got
him
downstairs
and
into
bed
but
he
did
not
recognise
any
of
us
and
the
next
morning
at
three
he
died
porter
said
the
attack
was
brought
on
by
worry
and
brain
fatigue
it
seems
so
sad
just
on
the
eve
of
his
first
success
for
nearly
all
the
carts
one
meets
throughout
the
city
nowadays
dump
in
way
though
the
patent
bears
name
and
we
never
found
the
contract
perry
says
he
knows
nothing
about
it
and
that
he
never
signed
any
he
has
his
brother
as
witness
to
a
verbal
agreement
entered
into
that
same
afternoon
in
his
office
by
which
father
sold
the
model
outright
for
five
hundred
dollars
which
was
paid
to
him
the
same
date
by
check
it
is
true
that
perry
paid
father
we
found
the
check
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
but
it
was
only
on
account
we
feel
sure
without
the
contract
however
we
can
prove
nothing
and
are
quite
helpless
could
father
have
lost
it
or
left
it
anywhere
that
afternoon
even
a
little
income
would
be
very
nice
then
perhaps
we
would
not
have
to
take
boarders
there
is
bell
she
has
rung
twice
rose
answer
it
i
must
fly
saturday
november
blue
blue
blue
oh
dear
i
do
feel
blue
and
so
does
every
one
else
even
the
kitten
in
the
first
place
the
house
is
cold
we
have
not
been
able
to
get
the
above
at
any
time
and
the
boarders
appear
to
believe
that
we
keep
it
at
that
cosey
temperature
out
of
pure
spite
and
malevolence
friend
considers
it
a
stupid
form
of
suicide
to
economise
coal
in
weather
hudson
remarked
this
morning
we
had
not
been
economising
but
nevertheless
we
felt
crushed
for
whenever
hudson
has
a
criticism
to
make
it
comes
under
cover
of
the
same
potent
name
i
spell
it
quite
correctly
but
it
is
invariably
pronounced
none
of
us
have
ever
met
none
of
us
ever
expect
to
meet
her
is
a
sort
of
cousin
to
the
famous
harris
we
are
sometimes
tempted
to
believe
it
is
through
her
reported
remarks
that
we
are
given
the
coveted
if
immensely
overestimated
advantage
of
ourselves
as
others
see
this
none
too
flattering
vision
resulted
in
haze
being
sent
down
to
shake
up
the
furnace
did
not
prevent
miss
brown
from
wearing
her
pink
knitted
shawl
all
day
and
sniffing
and
rubbing
the
red
tip
of
her
nose
just
why
these
artless
actions
should
have
enraged
me
i
know
but
somehow
they
did
as
ernie
once
sagely
remarked
innocent
a
habits
they
are
bound
to
be
then
too
i
broke
a
string
of
my
mandolin
and
i
have
not
five
cents
in
the
world
with
which
to
buy
another
it
is
almost
amusing
to
be
as
poor
as
that
also
haze
is
growing
cross
as
well
as
homely
because
it
does
not
agree
with
him
to
study
late
at
night
last
evening
when
i
put
on
my
and
ran
up
to
the
workshop
for
a
little
chat
i
found
the
poor
boy
sitting
in
the
with
his
overcoat
on
is
in
the
workshop
let
me
tell
you
away
at
his
latin
he
looked
up
over
his
glasses
and
scowled
at
me
it
make
you
dream
worse
than
ever
to
sit
there
dear
i
asked
sails
keep
the
draughts
off
answered
hazard
in
sepulchral
tones
are
you
studying
haze
i
ventured
next
lessons
came
the
communicative
croak
nice
chummy
conversation
that
so
i
retired
but
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
be
honest
and
admit
that
none
of
the
reasons
i
have
mentioned
yet
have
anything
to
do
with
making
me
unhappy
it
is
about
robin
we
ought
to
take
such
good
care
of
him
we
thursday
he
caught
cold
sitting
on
the
draughty
floor
and
as
usual
it
settled
in
his
little
lame
side
so
mother
kept
him
in
bed
yesterday
morning
and
i
amused
him
with
games
and
stories
after
lunch
he
grew
feverish
and
tired
you
like
me
to
read
again
bobsie
i
asked
thank
you
honey
he
answered
and
turned
his
head
wearily
among
the
pillows
you
like
to
play
or
dear
they
a
bit
of
good
when
your
legs
ache
sing
shall
i
sing
i
asked
heaven
said
bobsie
we
did
last
sunday
it
a
bit
priggish
the
way
he
said
it
simple
and
wistful
and
very
sweet
so
i
took
him
in
my
arms
in
the
big
and
sang
all
the
heaven
hymns
i
know
first
a
home
for
little
children
then
the
golden
and
heard
a
sound
of
voices
around
the
great
white
throne
with
harpers
harping
on
their
harps
to
him
that
sits
when
i
came
to
that
last
beautiful
verse
lamb
of
god
who
reignest
thou
bright
and
morning
star
whose
glory
lightens
that
new
earth
which
now
we
see
from
far
o
worthy
judge
eternal
when
thou
dost
bid
us
come
then
open
wide
the
gates
of
pearl
and
call
thy
servants
home
the
thought
flashed
through
me
if
god
should
really
take
robin
from
us
too
as
well
as
father
and
i
stopped
singing
and
hugged
him
tight
and
hurt
his
little
aching
back
the
matter
elizabeth
asked
bobsie
fretfully
was
just
going
to
honey
i
answered
but
that
night
after
i
had
gone
to
bed
the
terror
returned
and
i
could
not
get
any
peace
or
rest
i
could
not
say
my
prayers
right
either
for
it
seemed
as
if
heaven
were
full
of
harping
and
singing
voices
and
god
would
not
hear
so
i
tossed
and
turned
till
finally
i
woke
ernie
the
matter
elizabeth
she
asked
just
as
robin
had
ernie
i
answered
so
unhappy
been
thinking
that
perhaps
bobsie
is
going
to
of
course
all
going
to
some
day
answered
ernie
sleepily
but
she
slipped
her
hand
into
mine
like
a
cuddlesome
kitten
and
somehow
i
felt
comforted
porter
says
that
what
robin
needs
is
the
that
is
to
go
away
in
the
summer
to
the
seashore
or
mountains
to
have
good
nourishing
food
proper
clothing
and
plenty
of
fresh
air
all
the
year
round
and
neither
to
be
overstimulated
nor
worried
nice
possible
prescription
uncle
george
means
to
do
what
is
right
i
am
sure
but
oh
why
he
say
is
take
it
and
make
robin
if
it
were
georgie
who
was
ill
that
reminds
me
that
geof
was
in
this
afternoon
quite
sulky
and
injured
because
he
had
to
go
to
the
opera
this
evening
has
a
friend
staying
with
her
he
explained
they
prance
round
and
see
everything
all
right
but
why
do
they
have
to
lug
me
along
geof
purred
ernie
who
is
always
sympathetic
is
it
going
to
be
i
know
answered
geoffrey
all
the
same
a
fellow
in
pink
pants
gets
up
and
bellows
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
leap
a
dish
the
lady
answers
to
the
same
tune
only
shriller
and
then
they
both
die
giddy
show
that
we
could
not
help
laughing
but
how
i
wish
i
were
going
in
place
mother
would
be
sorry
if
she
could
see
what
i
have
written
i
think
she
would
call
it
cowardly
she
always
faces
things
so
bravely
dear
mother
if
she
can
be
cheerful
and
i
am
sure
the
rest
of
us
should
be
try
will
will
comes
sunday
november
robin
is
better
this
morning
he
woke
quite
free
from
pain
so
mother
has
let
him
up
again
perhaps
god
did
hear
in
spite
of
the
harping
elizabeth
monday
december
hudson
is
going
and
oh
dear
we
afford
it
it
is
all
fault
too
how
could
she
have
been
so
careless
this
is
the
way
it
happened
have
had
a
visit
from
no
one
would
have
believed
it
possible
no
one
really
i
suppose
except
miss
brown
and
robin
entirely
believed
there
was
any
a
but
her
existence
was
proven
to
us
let
me
begin
at
the
beginning
and
explain
hudson
has
been
with
us
six
months
now
renting
the
alcove
room
and
during
all
that
time
whether
the
beefsteak
was
tough
or
the
house
cold
she
has
never
personally
complained
it
has
been
rather
friend
simply
endure
such
a
draught
as
this
it
would
give
her
pneumonia
directly
she
is
a
very
sensitive
woman
i
call
a
true
blood
she
indeed
miss
brown
would
murmur
antiphonically
responsive
miss
brown
is
meek
and
meagre
and
easily
impressed
hudson
would
continue
swelling
visibly
under
the
arrested
attention
of
the
entire
dinner
table
for
everybody
listens
when
hudson
talks
is
what
i
should
certainly
call
her
now
a
soup
such
as
we
are
eating
this
evening
simply
on
stummick
it
is
too
stummick
is
too
thick
queries
hancock
anxiously
he
is
a
dyspeptic
himself
and
very
much
interested
in
anything
pertaining
to
symptoms
or
dietetics
at
all
answers
hudson
slightly
ruffled
at
the
misapprehension
is
too
whereupon
hancock
who
has
been
eating
quite
comfortably
up
to
the
present
moment
takes
to
stirring
round
and
round
his
plate
with
reproachful
sweeps
of
the
spoon
till
his
wife
inquires
soothingly
you
think
we
might
try
some
of
that
glucose
bread
we
saw
advertised
ducky
sure
graham
would
get
it
for
the
hancocks
are
young
and
recently
married
he
is
a
bank
clerk
with
poppy
eyes
she
is
small
and
plump
and
pretty
they
are
and
to
each
other
they
are
really
nice
and
considerate
so
one
feels
rather
shabby
to
poke
fun
however
to
return
to
it
was
not
only
what
she
could
not
eat
she
had
a
great
many
opinions
as
well
especially
as
to
how
people
reduced
should
live
thinks
that
if
you
can
only
afford
one
servant
you
should
certainly
engage
for
there
is
nothing
that
pays
so
well
as
she
also
a
great
many
other
things
pause
to
relate
them
here
no
matter
how
patently
absurd
her
opinions
might
be
they
were
reported
as
such
delphic
utterances
that
no
one
dreamed
of
questioning
them
every
fortnight
or
so
hudson
has
been
in
the
habit
of
paying
a
call
one
always
learned
at
the
breakfast
table
when
one
of
these
visits
was
about
to
take
place
for
hudson
dressed
for
them
upon
rising
no
matter
what
time
of
day
she
may
have
planned
to
start
in
a
purple
velvet
with
white
linen
collar
and
cuffs
and
a
very
much
crimped
blond
false
front
her
own
hair
is
decidedly
gray
when
she
goes
to
church
or
shopping
with
miss
brown
or
even
to
the
theatre
this
answers
it
is
only
for
the
blond
crimps
appear
naturally
this
morning
when
hudson
descended
upon
us
full
panoply
of
as
haze
expressed
it
we
supposed
she
must
be
going
to
pay
one
of
her
ceremonial
visits
both
mother
and
i
felt
relieved
for
the
house
continued
cold
despite
all
our
efforts
but
we
made
no
remark
and
hudson
volunteered
no
information
till
rose
appeared
rather
untidy
as
to
dress
and
apron
bearing
a
plate
of
slightly
burned
biscuits
then
it
began
establishment
consists
of
three
maids
and
an
imported
butler
his
name
is
samuels
an
if
you
please
miss
brown
one
can
judge
from
that
fact
alone
of
the
style
to
which
she
is
indeed
murmured
miss
brown
anything
like
continued
hudson
helping
herself
to
a
biscuit
and
weighing
it
accusingly
on
extended
palm
on
stummick
she
is
used
to
lunching
at
or
the
waldorf
every
day
if
she
pleases
however
i
have
warned
her
she
must
expect
to
find
things
different
she
is
fully
prepared
for
i
explained
everything
when
i
issued
my
exclaimed
mother
setting
down
the
cream
jug
with
undue
suddenness
while
hancock
who
had
been
morosely
weighing
his
biscuit
in
servile
imitation
of
hudson
dropped
it
into
his
coffee
cup
and
stared
with
popping
eyes
returned
hudson
evidently
very
well
satisfied
with
the
impression
she
was
producing
i
mentioned
that
i
am
expecting
a
visit
from
she
is
coming
to
lunch
with
me
it
seemed
about
time
i
should
repay
some
of
her
hospitality
i
hope
my
little
plan
in
no
way
inconveniences
any
one
haze
kicked
me
under
the
table
ernie
wriggled
ecstatically
robin
sighed
and
opened
wide
shining
eyes
while
poor
miss
brown
murmured
feebly
hudson
oh
really
mother
was
the
first
to
regain
her
composure
will
be
very
glad
to
meet
any
friend
of
yours
hudson
she
said
i
am
sorry
you
did
not
tell
me
before
it
would
have
been
easier
to
make
i
intended
to
do
so
observed
hudson
the
fact
is
the
matter
slipped
my
we
looked
at
one
another
in
open
admiration
could
human
cheek
be
carried
further
was
coming
to
luncheon
and
fact
had
slipped
gradually
the
boarders
faded
from
the
room
leaving
us
to
a
hurried
family
council
it
was
monday
there
was
cold
roast
left
over
from
dinner
and
a
washerwoman
in
the
kitchen
yet
strangely
enough
no
one
thought
of
rebellion
or
complaint
murmured
haze
in
a
voice
as
nearly
like
miss
as
he
could
make
it
you
know
is
coming
to
lunch
and
then
for
no
earthly
assignable
reason
we
dropped
into
various
receptacles
along
the
way
and
melted
and
sobbed
with
mirth
robin
caught
his
knees
in
both
arms
and
rolled
over
and
over
on
the
rug
a
corner
of
the
tablecloth
stuffed
in
his
mouth
ernie
began
to
caper
and
frisk
madly
about
hugging
the
bewildered
and
rebellious
kitten
i
sank
helpless
on
the
and
hid
my
face
among
the
curtains
the
door
hazard
gasped
mother
as
soon
as
she
was
able
to
articulate
us
at
which
the
gale
began
afresh
somehow
the
situation
struck
us
as
irresistibly
funny
chuckled
hazard
weakly
at
last
no
lark
here
for
me
i
meet
her
be
away
at
i
have
a
holiday
and
because
they
are
repairing
the
furnaces
how
jolly
cried
ernie
she
come
in
a
hansom
piped
robin
by
fairy
he
meant
the
ferry
and
these
two
modes
of
conveyance
are
the
most
elegant
known
to
his
youthful
experience
came
to
town
riding
in
a
parodied
haze
driven
by
samuels
an
if
you
please
miss
brown
mocked
ernie
wickedly
children
warned
mother
must
be
serious
it
is
you
know
i
had
planned
cold
veal
for
luncheon
even
chicken
pleaded
ernestine
the
situation
as
one
faced
it
loomed
portentous
the
psychic
power
of
that
name
was
not
to
be
lightly
evaded
said
mother
at
last
with
a
little
sigh
must
do
the
best
we
can
elizabeth
will
help
me
in
the
kitchen
rose
is
never
the
least
good
of
a
monday
and
ernestine
can
dress
robin
and
superintend
the
setting
of
the
table
let
me
see
there
will
be
six
seven
of
us
haze
and
hancock
who
fortunately
do
not
lunch
at
home
i
like
an
even
table
so
much
me
wait
then
mother
dear
volunteered
ernie
way
i
do
sunday
evenings
when
rose
is
out
you
know
she
never
does
serve
things
would
not
mind
asked
mother
indeed
not
a
bit
answered
ernie
frankly
will
know
i
am
your
daughter
just
the
same
and
i
think
it
is
rather
so
it
was
arranged
the
took
a
little
longer
to
plan
and
with
cooking
dusting
and
dressing
the
morning
flew
swiftly
by
one
might
have
supposed
we
were
preparing
for
a
royal
visit
eleven
struck
eleven
robin
and
ernie
in
their
pretty
blue
flashed
down
to
the
kitchen
for
inspection
she
be
here
soon
pranced
robin
his
eyes
were
bright
as
stars
his
cheeks
as
pink
as
roses
think
so
answered
mother
up
to
the
nursery
now
where
you
can
watch
from
the
at
quarter
to
twelve
precisely
there
sounded
the
clatter
of
feet
upon
the
asphalt
shall
i
confess
it
interrupting
a
hasty
toilet
i
ran
to
the
window
too
and
peeped
out
like
any
child
a
as
robin
had
predicted
was
drawn
up
before
our
door
from
it
stepped
a
lady
she
was
tall
somewhat
spare
attired
in
conventional
black
from
the
distance
at
which
i
surveyed
her
she
looked
a
little
just
a
she
mounted
the
steps
and
rang
the
bell
the
excitement
died
from
my
brain
a
chill
feeling
of
disappointment
crept
over
me
was
this
the
phœnix
this
the
invisible
mentor
under
whose
our
household
had
trembled
for
so
many
months
a
minute
later
the
sound
of
subdued
greeting
floated
up
from
the
hall
below
do
you
do
hudson
do
do
i
went
into
the
nursery
to
capture
robin
and
give
his
locks
one
final
dab
before
lunch
should
be
announced
just
like
anybody
else
he
mourned
lifting
a
face
from
where
it
had
been
buried
in
his
arm
against
the
window
sill
dearest
what
did
you
expect
i
asked
with
an
absurd
inflection
of
sympathetic
woe
know
admitted
bobsie
somehow
i
would
be
then
the
bell
rang
and
we
hastened
downstairs
in
the
the
presentations
were
being
made
graham
allow
me
the
honour
of
presenting
my
friend
miss
brown
allow
me
to
present
my
friend
miss
hancock
allow
me
the
honour
of
presenting
my
friend
immediately
our
spirits
rose
it
was
an
occasion
after
all
hudson
felt
it
i
felt
it
robin
felt
it
he
put
out
his
little
hand
quite
prettily
when
his
turn
came
this
is
the
lame
boy
remarked
in
a
stiff
falsetto
protested
robin
i
think
he
had
ever
been
called
lame
before
just
hop
a
little
because
sometimes
my
side
is
the
same
thing
my
dear
explained
hudson
knows
all
about
such
matters
she
sits
on
two
hospitals
boards
and
is
secretary
of
the
free
kindergarten
murmured
miss
brown
with
hudson
as
expositor
and
miss
brown
as
chorus
glory
could
not
wane
she
shone
upon
us
enigmatic
throughout
a
somewhat
oppressive
meal
no
one
but
hudson
ventured
to
mingle
in
the
conversation
indeed
it
was
not
necessary
ernie
waited
very
prettily
the
croquettes
were
silently
engulfed
likewise
the
custards
and
despite
sensitive
we
were
encouraged
to
believe
that
they
would
dear
will
you
play
for
us
hudson
asked
after
lunch
is
very
fond
of
it
was
rather
a
royal
command
than
a
request
but
without
an
string
what
could
one
do
perhaps
your
little
brother
will
recite
persisted
hudson
shall
i
say
elizabeth
asked
robin
obligingly
you
say
shadow
i
suggested
so
bobsie
flushed
and
honoured
standing
on
the
worn
bokhara
rug
began
have
a
little
shadow
that
goes
in
and
out
with
me
and
what
can
be
the
use
of
him
is
more
than
i
can
the
ladies
sat
about
the
parlour
their
hands
folded
in
their
laps
with
her
head
a
little
to
one
side
as
if
listening
for
a
false
note
hudson
pompously
responsible
miss
brown
meekly
appreciative
funniest
thing
about
him
is
the
way
he
likes
to
grow
not
at
all
like
proper
children
which
is
always
rather
slow
piped
robin
in
his
pretty
treble
he
sometimes
shoots
up
taller
head
tilted
just
a
little
to
the
left
queried
hudson
you
sure
of
that
word
robin
paused
and
looked
doubtfully
at
me
i
answered
is
an
ball
continued
robin
head
again
cocked
towards
the
left
and
a
slightly
pained
expression
gathered
between
her
brows
it
my
dear
corrected
hudson
the
first
word
is
it
certainly
must
be
an
i
said
is
he
sometimes
gets
so
little
that
none
of
him
at
all
persisted
robin
bravely
pursed
her
lips
well
concluded
hudson
hurriedly
is
a
very
pretty
piece
no
doubt
and
we
are
much
obliged
but
sit
here
all
the
afternoon
listening
to
one
little
boy
recite
when
she
might
hear
twenty
any
day
she
pleased
all
with
kindergarten
training
too
there
are
some
photographs
we
have
planned
to
look
over
upstairs
so
you
will
excuse
and
the
two
ladies
rising
with
majestic
accord
swept
from
the
room
it
was
rather
dampening
to
be
sure
but
bobsie
bore
it
well
only
his
lower
lip
trembled
a
little
as
he
asked
have
been
a
now
could
it
ellie
that
is
his
pet
name
for
me
he
uses
it
when
he
stands
in
need
of
comfort
honey
i
answered
certainly
when
just
at
that
moment
there
was
a
crash
and
a
hurtle
and
a
smothered
squeal
in
the
hall
outside
and
we
all
ran
out
to
see
what
could
be
happening
i
shall
never
forget
it
down
the
stairway
from
the
second
story
step
after
step
with
a
little
bump
on
each
coasted
ernie
her
feet
were
stuck
out
straight
before
her
her
arms
were
aloft
in
one
hand
she
bore
a
pitcher
of
in
the
other
a
tumbler
while
old
silver
serving
tray
rattled
and
rolled
ahead
the
poor
mouth
was
open
and
every
few
steps
she
would
emit
a
deprecating
little
squeak
as
if
to
say
know
i
ought
not
to
be
tumbling
downstairs
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
hudson
and
who
had
started
to
go
up
in
search
of
the
photographs
stood
midway
of
the
flight
directly
in
the
path
of
danger
oh
ernie
i
cried
out
look
for
gurgled
ernie
her
and
then
there
was
a
second
crash
and
a
splash
and
a
renewed
series
of
squeals
and
hudson
and
and
ernie
and
the
pitcher
and
the
silver
tray
all
came
crashing
and
bumping
down
together
in
one
ignominious
tangle
mother
and
hancock
and
rose
came
running
from
various
parts
of
the
house
in
a
moment
there
was
quite
a
crowd
gathered
first
hudson
was
picked
up
spluttering
and
bewildered
next
we
rescued
then
ernie
who
still
clung
desperately
to
her
pitcher
all
dignity
all
sense
of
social
circumstance
had
vanished
the
members
of
the
dripping
little
group
glared
upon
one
another
humanly
democratically
mad
said
ernestine
thrusting
out
the
pitcher
resentfully
to
hudson
guess
this
belongs
to
was
the
ceremonial
blond
front
which
had
somehow
come
unpinned
in
the
mêlée
and
was
now
floating
in
a
few
inches
of
at
the
bottom
of
the
pitcher
hudson
sniffed
fished
out
her
crimps
and
flapped
them
scornfully
leave
this
house
she
remarked
are
all
very
well
in
their
my
contradicted
ernie
wrathfully
slipped
on
the
top
step
and
tobogganed
rebuked
mother
trust
you
are
not
hurt
she
continued
turning
to
who
stood
beside
the
ruefully
rubbing
an
elbow
being
a
christian
scientist
nor
yet
a
image
i
confess
to
a
few
bruises
returned
that
lady
spitefully
after
which
she
and
hudson
swept
on
their
way
upstairs
leaving
us
at
gaze
if
i
meant
to
brooded
ernestine
not
a
christian
scientist
myself
why
they
get
out
of
the
way
like
to
know
bogardus
for
the
first
time
the
question
was
presented
to
us
squarely
we
gaped
at
one
another
like
so
many
goldfish
is
so
admitted
miss
brown
in
a
timid
voice
after
a
moment
of
deep
thought
is
she
it
have
been
a
chirped
bobsie
with
sudden
easy
confidence
then
there
be
any
was
a
hired
hansom
she
came
in
observed
hancock
cheerfully
did
you
notice
that
she
ate
three
of
those
fried
croquettes
for
lunch
her
stummick
be
so
very
sensitive
after
all
i
shall
have
to
tell
my
husband
certainly
pitcher
of
had
had
a
wonderfully
quenching
effect
but
hudson
is
going
and
as
i
said
we
afford
it
was
only
trying
to
help
murmurs
ernie
mournfully
pulling
off
one
of
her
long
stockings
as
she
sits
on
the
floor
in
the
middle
of
our
little
room
stop
writing
elizabeth
and
come
to
bed
there
is
a
smudge
of
ink
on
the
tip
of
your
nose
where
you
dipped
it
in
the
bottle
and
i
just
know
you
are
saying
it
is
my
dear
little
ernie
how
did
she
ever
guess
tuesday
december
hudson
left
this
afternoon
despite
the
fact
that
ernie
apologised
to
her
very
meekly
this
morning
you
really
think
i
ought
mother
ernie
asked
dear
i
do
mother
answered
was
frightened
and
hurt
and
we
are
all
ernie
made
a
wry
face
stay
if
she
knows
i
did
not
mean
it
she
said
answered
mother
am
sure
that
she
will
not
it
is
not
for
that
reason
that
i
want
you
to
apologise
apart
from
the
financial
inconvenience
i
regret
decision
in
some
ways
it
will
be
a
great
here
goes
announced
ernestine
little
christian
martyr
bids
a
last
to
her
fond
and
she
turned
and
ran
from
the
room
she
found
hudson
packing
know
i
did
not
mean
to
tumble
downstairs
hudson
she
told
me
later
that
she
said
sorry
that
i
had
the
pitcher
with
me
i
was
taking
it
up
to
your
room
for
seemed
to
be
coming
the
stairs
when
we
met
you
returned
hudson
suspiciously
confessed
ernie
know
it
i
had
brought
up
only
one
glass
i
was
going
back
for
another
and
my
foot
returned
hudson
evidently
quite
unmollified
will
say
no
more
about
it
for
a
long
time
i
have
felt
that
a
change
would
be
desirable
incident
simply
confirmed
me
in
my
resolution
i
am
going
from
here
to
stop
with
a
friend
for
a
day
or
two
till
i
can
look
around
and
get
more
comfortably
hope
you
will
have
a
good
time
sure
observed
ernie
forgivingly
i
want
to
visit
hudson
stared
she
queried
my
dear
and
directly
after
lunch
she
left
us
and
ernie
started
in
on
a
wild
hunt
for
to
look
for
the
contract
is
last
resource
in
times
of
trouble
must
be
somewhere
elizabeth
she
argues
why
not
about
the
house
we
know
perfectly
well
that
father
went
especially
to
get
it
signed
that
afternoon
he
have
come
away
without
it
perhaps
poked
in
a
or
under
the
on
his
desk
or
maybe
even
back
of
the
and
so
though
these
very
places
have
been
ransacked
again
and
again
ernie
proceeded
to
turn
the
workshop
upside
down
herself
with
dust
crawling
under
cot
skinned
the
tip
of
her
nose
on
the
and
tore
a
great
rent
in
her
pink
flannel
petticoat
about
three
geof
dropped
in
as
he
generally
does
on
his
way
home
from
school
and
joined
in
the
chase
you
mean
to
say
you
have
really
lost
a
boarder
he
asked
summing
the
catastrophe
with
a
worried
look
afford
it
can
you
answered
ernie
mournfully
i
just
wish
mother
would
whip
me
as
i
deserve
awful
to
love
your
family
geof
and
be
nothing
to
them
but
a
misfortune
perhaps
if
we
let
room
soon
we
be
able
to
afford
ice
cream
on
sundays
and
hancock
likes
ice
cream
better
than
anything
in
the
world
will
be
leaving
cheer
up
said
geoffrey
not
a
misfortune
to
anybody
ernie
if
only
uncle
dudley
had
finished
this
three
of
us
were
standing
rather
disconsolately
about
the
have
to
think
of
boarders
or
or
anything
like
that
be
rich
and
famous
too
did
he
ever
make
an
ascension
do
you
know
late
at
night
he
tried
answered
ernestine
i
think
it
was
a
success
he
only
rose
a
few
feet
from
the
roof
and
then
got
tangled
in
some
of
the
come
on
geof
look
once
more
in
the
it
stands
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
you
know
father
might
have
stopped
to
wind
it
and
slipped
the
agreement
into
the
works
by
mistake
it
buzzed
fearfully
the
last
time
we
tried
to
make
it
go
if
it
were
suffering
from
some
sort
of
entertaining
no
personal
hope
in
regard
to
the
i
left
them
on
the
landing
and
ran
down
to
the
where
i
found
haze
who
had
also
just
come
in
he
was
standing
in
the
window
looking
ruefully
over
the
gas
bill
which
the
postman
had
handed
him
through
the
grating
hudson
has
really
gone
he
began
throwing
off
his
overcoat
as
far
as
i
can
see
that
means
just
one
does
it
mean
haze
i
asked
surprised
at
his
tone
i
give
up
high
school
answered
hazard
gloomily
and
cast
his
books
and
cap
together
upon
a
chair
hazey
i
protested
that
be
rash
we
may
let
room
may
returned
hazard
we
then
he
seated
himself
astride
the
chair
his
arms
folded
across
the
back
his
chin
resting
upon
his
arms
this
way
elizabeth
he
began
the
man
of
the
family
and
i
shirk
my
you
shirking
hazard
i
urged
settling
myself
in
the
opposite
him
are
working
and
working
hard
to
finish
your
education
it
would
be
a
dreadful
thing
for
you
to
give
up
now
would
mean
a
handicap
for
years
perhaps
for
fellows
have
got
to
accept
a
handicap
answered
hazard
the
very
fact
that
they
know
it
spurs
them
on
that
in
the
end
perhaps
it
a
bad
thing
been
doing
a
lot
of
thinking
lately
but
i
make
up
my
mind
and
so
i
talk
not
even
to
you
old
girl
but
this
is
how
it
stands
i
bear
to
see
mother
struggling
along
with
the
house
and
robin
and
all
her
worries
to
satisfy
everybody
being
snubbed
sometimes
at
first
i
thought
give
up
college
you
know
intended
going
in
for
the
conklin
scholarship
and
every
one
said
i
would
win
it
too
but
even
so
there
would
be
two
more
years
of
study
and
not
sure
i
could
keep
up
the
pace
set
myself
lately
then
i
had
a
talk
with
merriweather
the
other
merriweather
is
the
principal
of
school
altogether
satisfactory
he
think
a
fellow
gets
any
good
cramming
the
way
been
doing
and
he
intimated
that
even
if
i
took
the
examinations
next
fall
and
passed
he
at
all
sure
that
he
would
graduate
me
well
that
pretty
nearly
settled
the
business
and
now
this
affair
at
home
drives
in
the
last
nail
going
to
quit
and
take
my
proper
place
as
the
head
of
the
hazard
i
urged
you
think
you
ought
to
consult
mother
or
some
older
person
first
a
very
grave
step
for
you
to
take
on
your
own
responsibility
and
besides
i
believe
mother
will
you
be
the
head
of
the
family
and
who
would
employ
you
and
what
sort
of
position
could
you
fill
depends
upon
the
acumen
of
the
man
to
whom
i
apply
returned
hazey
with
such
an
owly
look
through
his
big
glasses
that
i
really
wanted
to
laugh
know
elizabeth
how
uncle
george
is
continually
repeating
that
though
he
care
for
talent
in
his
business
he
is
willing
to
pay
for
got
and
going
to
rent
them
to
him
a
sacrifice
but
made
up
my
mind
so
no
use
wait
till
the
end
of
the
week
any
way
dear
i
pleaded
us
that
long
at
least
to
rent
the
wait
till
saturday
compromised
hazard
shall
have
finished
the
punic
wars
by
that
time
and
written
a
rather
stunning
outline
on
the
subject
i
should
like
to
have
criticised
but
if
the
room
rented
by
then
i
quit
now
remember
elizabeth
not
a
word
of
this
to
anybody
ernestine
i
want
her
to
feel
that
she
is
in
any
way
responsible
for
blighting
my
tell
i
answered
and
so
of
course
i
but
oh
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
hazard
is
making
a
mistake
wednesday
december
we
advertised
room
it
cost
a
dollar
ernie
wanted
to
say
that
we
are
a
refined
christian
family
with
a
good
table
but
mother
would
not
hear
of
it
was
lucky
considering
the
price
when
the
advertisement
was
finally
ready
haze
and
i
took
it
around
to
the
newspaper
office
the
long
shining
shafts
cast
by
the
on
the
wet
asphalt
it
had
been
raining
made
us
feel
quite
frisky
i
would
rather
be
a
mediæval
knight
than
a
girl
whose
mother
keeps
a
as
haze
observed
there
are
diversions
in
every
lot
friday
december
this
morning
we
had
a
call
from
aunt
adelaide
she
came
us
because
she
had
heard
about
hudson
aunt
adelaide
does
not
call
very
often
but
when
she
does
she
makes
the
best
of
her
time
she
had
georgie
with
her
charmingly
dressed
he
wore
a
dear
little
overcoat
and
a
cap
with
snug
and
a
jaunty
cockade
how
i
wanted
them
for
robin
took
cold
yesterday
when
ernie
had
him
out
on
her
sled
it
was
the
first
snowstorm
of
the
season
and
bobs
did
so
beg
to
go
but
he
is
in
bed
again
suffering
with
rheumatism
in
his
back
dear
patient
little
lamb
much
sickness
is
most
unfortunate
reproved
aunt
adelaide
you
subordinate
the
children
a
little
more
margaret
how
can
you
expect
people
to
stop
in
a
house
where
there
is
continual
invalidism
expect
it
returned
mother
cheerfully
is
a
perpetual
surprise
to
me
that
anybody
aunt
adelaide
stiffened
you
considered
the
consequences
if
they
did
not
she
asked
admitted
mother
should
starve
i
suppose
man
does
not
live
by
advice
was
really
very
much
put
out
when
he
heard
that
you
had
lost
hudson
continued
aunt
adelaide
is
most
discouraging
you
were
beginning
to
get
along
quite
nicely
a
man
who
has
so
many
heavy
responsibilities
naturally
feels
each
extra
course
agreed
mother
must
be
very
trying
to
have
poor
relations
i
am
here
georgie
interrupted
said
i
should
visit
with
bobsie
mamma
he
cried
want
to
go
up
now
and
tell
him
about
my
new
stupid
down
will
take
you
love
answered
his
mother
apparently
without
the
least
thought
of
so
i
took
georgie
by
the
hand
and
led
him
up
to
the
nursery
when
i
returned
to
the
library
the
conversation
had
been
switched
he
grows
worse
and
worse
aunt
adelaide
was
saying
as
i
entered
the
room
he
was
openly
impertinent
to
me
and
flatly
refused
to
accompany
meta
to
i
do
not
wish
to
bring
the
affair
to
his
father
who
is
rather
severe
at
times
but
i
declare
there
is
no
managing
the
boy
he
study
he
has
no
manners
and
he
resents
interference
in
any
it
was
geoffrey
of
i
felt
sorry
so
did
mother
the
mocking
note
had
quite
died
from
her
voice
as
she
answered
simply
and
kindly
think
you
are
a
little
unjust
adelaide
geoffrey
requires
tactful
handling
i
know
he
is
apt
to
be
sullen
at
times
he
is
not
bookish
but
in
his
own
way
along
the
mechanical
line
it
seems
to
me
that
he
is
really
aunt
adelaide
sighed
forbid
his
being
an
inventor
one
is
misfortune
enough
for
any
mother
merely
smiled
that
little
quiet
smile
of
hers
and
asked
how
meta
was
progressing
with
her
music
she
will
never
discuss
father
with
either
aunt
adelaide
or
uncle
george
the
attack
was
not
to
be
so
easily
repelled
and
aunt
adelaide
returned
to
it
a
moment
later
by
asking
bluntly
if
there
had
been
any
further
news
of
perry
and
whether
we
had
given
up
all
hope
of
finding
the
contract
says
the
whole
affair
is
entirely
typical
of
poor
dudley
she
declared
has
not
an
ounce
of
patience
with
and
then
after
a
few
further
generalities
aunt
adelaide
prepared
to
leave
quite
unconscious
that
she
had
said
anything
to
wound
or
offend
any
one
and
i
was
sent
upstairs
to
fetch
georgie
i
knew
that
there
was
trouble
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
nursery
door
for
bobs
in
his
little
old
flannel
was
sitting
up
very
straight
and
in
big
bed
pretending
to
look
at
a
while
georgie
with
red
face
and
hands
thrust
deep
in
his
was
standing
by
the
window
pretending
to
look
out
tell
you
something
more
you
know
said
robin
glancing
up
from
his
book
after
a
silence
they
had
neither
of
them
seen
me
enter
the
room
i
know
you
do
chanted
georgie
monotonously
know
what
a
chimera
is
and
you
know
what
a
gorgon
is
and
you
know
what
a
hippogrif
is
and
you
know
what
a
ninkum
is
you
if
you
saw
one
and
you
know
what
a
siren
is
and
you
know
what
syrian
is
now
neither
do
you
george
seemed
rather
overpowered
by
this
erudite
outburst
but
he
reiterated
stubbornly
know
you
do
a
very
imp
asked
bobs
excitedly
know
and
a
jabberwock
and
a
mockturtle
eat
it
in
soup
answered
georgie
brightening
up
a
bit
had
it
the
night
the
general
came
and
william
let
me
taste
some
out
of
a
teaspoon
in
the
pantry
there
scorn
was
withering
eat
a
ninkum
in
a
mockturtle
was
once
a
real
turtle
but
here
i
thought
it
best
to
interfere
adelaide
is
going
georgie
i
said
had
better
come
downstairs
as
soon
as
georgie
saw
me
he
put
his
finger
in
his
mouth
and
began
to
cry
and
asked
to
be
taken
down
to
mamma
for
bobsie
was
rude
to
him
and
said
he
know
things
certainly
is
not
very
polite
company
i
answered
for
best
good
and
took
georgie
by
the
hand
and
led
him
away
but
just
as
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
we
heard
the
unrepentant
robin
sing
out
triumphantly
tell
you
some
more
things
you
know
too
you
know
what
a
crusader
is
nor
a
centaur
nor
you
know
georgie
was
quite
overcome
by
this
last
taunt
he
clenched
his
fist
savagely
just
guess
i
do
know
he
sobbed
going
to
ask
mamma
if
i
and
he
broke
away
from
me
and
ran
into
the
parlour
of
course
aunt
adelaide
soothed
him
and
assured
him
that
he
knew
a
great
deal
for
a
little
boy
of
his
age
but
that
he
must
be
patient
with
his
little
sick
cousin
so
georgie
stopped
crying
and
looked
virtuous
while
aunt
adelaide
explained
to
mother
that
she
knew
just
how
it
was
in
regard
to
robin
and
thought
it
only
natural
that
he
should
be
pettish
and
quarrelsome
and
that
she
would
bring
georgie
soon
again
to
cheer
him
up
after
which
our
visitors
departed
in
quite
a
pleasant
glow
of
and
mother
went
downstairs
to
the
kitchen
mad
superintend
the
preparation
of
luncheon
and
i
ran
up
to
the
nursery
mad
try
and
soothe
ruffled
spirits
nor
did
it
take
me
long
to
learn
the
cause
of
the
disagreement
bobsie
was
only
too
eager
to
confide
it
seems
that
among
his
other
new
possessions
georgie
has
a
nursery
governess
who
is
teaching
him
to
read
and
though
robin
did
not
mind
about
the
pony
and
never
once
thought
of
envying
the
overcoat
and
cap
he
could
not
bear
to
be
told
that
georgie
knew
more
than
he
did
the
idea
is
really
ridiculous
to
any
one
who
knows
the
two
children
but
on
the
whole
it
had
been
an
excellent
thing
for
master
robin
to
face
for
now
he
is
determined
to
learn
to
read
too
proposition
we
could
never
get
him
to
entertain
before
as
he
always
said
perferred
to
lie
still
and
i
am
to
give
him
lessons
each
morning
and
if
he
sets
his
mind
to
it
i
am
sure
he
will
get
on
rapidly
just
think
dearest
haze
walked
home
from
school
this
afternoon
it
is
over
three
miles
bought
a
string
for
my
mandolin
with
his
car
fare
not
many
brothers
would
think
of
a
thing
like
that
sunday
december
room
is
not
yet
rented
we
have
not
even
had
any
answers
to
our
advertisement
the
strain
is
beginning
to
tell
on
us
all
more
or
less
i
think
and
yesterday
morning
hazard
carried
out
his
intention
of
calling
at
uncle
office
and
applying
for
a
position
i
wish
he
mother
agrees
with
me
that
it
was
a
mistake
indeed
she
was
quite
shocked
and
hurt
at
what
she
considered
his
lack
of
confidence
in
her
she
told
him
very
gravely
that
he
had
no
right
to
take
a
step
of
so
much
consequence
without
her
consent
and
that
the
little
he
can
make
will
in
no
way
compensate
for
the
loss
of
his
education
poor
hazey
he
was
so
disappointed
he
had
expected
the
news
would
be
received
very
differently
he
did
not
say
much
but
thrust
his
hands
deep
into
his
trouser
pockets
threw
back
his
head
and
strolled
whistling
from
the
room
i
followed
up
to
the
workshop
as
soon
as
i
was
able
and
i
he
had
been
crying
tell
me
about
your
position
haze
i
began
in
as
sprightly
tones
as
i
could
muster
for
we
had
not
heard
any
of
the
details
yet
nothing
to
tell
answered
hazard
gruffly
to
run
errands
post
letters
and
that
sort
of
thing
at
three
dollars
a
hazey
i
gasped
for
it
was
a
shock
hazard
is
certainly
clever
and
we
had
always
expected
such
different
things
for
him
says
haze
bitterly
uncle
idea
and
i
he
knows
what
he
is
about
i
gave
him
every
opportunity
and
put
the
matter
to
him
squarely
there
was
no
use
in
false
modesty
so
i
told
him
first
thing
that
i
had
had
a
year
of
greek
and
two
years
of
latin
and
led
my
geometry
class
but
that
we
needed
money
at
home
and
so
i
had
determined
to
sacrifice
my
future
and
rent
my
brains
at
their
highest
market
you
really
say
all
that
i
asked
i
did
answered
hazard
a
little
defiantly
it
was
a
mistake
but
i
wanted
to
make
things
plain
uncle
george
answer
just
at
first
he
looked
me
up
and
down
in
that
way
he
has
and
then
he
said
fellow
got
a
lot
to
learn
yet
if
any
other
cockerel
came
crowing
to
me
in
my
office
show
him
the
door
understand
one
thing
i
any
use
for
in
my
though
i
had
been
most
particular
elizabeth
to
use
the
word
you
remember
told
you
can
you
sweep
out
a
room
and
not
forget
the
corners
can
you
jump
when
sent
on
errands
then
apply
to
bridges
in
the
outside
office
i
believe
losing
a
boy
perhaps
you
are
bright
enough
to
fill
his
place
you
look
i
applied
and
got
the
position
concluded
haze
all
there
is
to
there
did
not
seem
much
for
me
to
say
since
haze
was
not
in
a
mood
to
be
grateful
for
platitudes
uncle
george
was
certainly
severe
but
maybe
he
meant
it
for
a
lesson
and
from
something
that
happened
this
afternoon
i
am
tempted
to
think
it
was
not
entirely
wasted
we
were
all
gathered
in
the
workshop
after
dinner
geoffrey
ernie
and
myself
wrapped
in
and
overcoats
disputing
about
our
favourite
apostles
when
haze
who
had
been
rather
subdued
and
the
greater
part
of
the
day
entered
the
room
he
had
a
notebook
under
his
arm
to
study
hazey
i
asked
him
for
he
intends
to
keep
up
his
latin
and
mother
has
promised
to
help
he
answered
with
really
appalling
solemnity
have
written
my
first
first
what
roars
geof
admitted
haze
blushing
a
bit
hat
murmurs
geof
is
so
sudden
but
go
on
old
chap
have
it
mind
you
treat
the
matter
with
respect
says
haze
suddenly
on
his
dignity
read
it
to
you
otherwise
i
ahead
urged
geoffrey
who
was
simply
on
the
to
hear
as
respectful
as
you
please
listen
and
then
larks
mind
warned
hazard
to
my
own
ideas
this
is
the
real
and
as
we
settled
ourselves
to
attention
in
the
he
began
in
what
i
can
only
call
an
sort
of
voice
the
young
man
and
the
world
the
young
man
faces
the
stern
cold
world
he
says
oyster
there
was
an
hysterical
gurgle
from
geof
and
a
fierce
quiet
you
from
ernestine
told
you
says
hazard
interrupting
himself
to
look
severely
over
his
glasses
it
is
perfectly
indifferent
to
me
whether
you
hear
this
thing
or
not
i
care
a
hang
for
your
literary
opinions
not
be
guyed
about
on
pleaded
geoffrey
with
a
watery
sidelong
look
at
me
guying
you
so
haze
began
afresh
the
young
man
and
the
world
the
young
man
faces
the
stern
cold
world
he
says
oyster
open
thy
shell
and
show
me
thy
pearl
like
the
hidden
wealth
of
a
the
cold
world
answers
never
a
word
the
youth
is
bound
if
he
can
to
take
up
his
pickaxe
and
work
for
himself
till
he
prove
that
he
a
man
ho
exploded
geof
unable
to
restrain
himself
a
moment
longer
is
good
the
way
to
get
after
bully
for
you
old
boy
do
you
think
elizabeth
says
hazard
haughtily
ignoring
this
demonstration
and
turning
somewhat
coldly
to
me
not
sure
that
you
could
say
hidden
wealth
of
a
i
answered
it
sound
exactly
he
says
oyster
murmured
geof
whereat
ernie
who
had
controlled
herself
beautifully
up
to
that
moment
gave
vent
to
one
enthusiastic
whoop
and
disappeared
backward
into
the
see
says
hazey
with
really
magnificent
aplomb
i
have
made
a
mistake
you
are
not
in
the
proper
mood
to
appreciate
the
thing
but
whatever
other
criticisms
you
may
make
at
least
be
bound
to
admit
that
it
sums
the
with
which
remark
he
stalked
from
the
room
dear
precious
fellow
evidently
he
has
been
thinking
why
oh
why
will
he
always
take
himself
so
seriously
monday
december
this
afternoon
mother
let
robin
up
in
the
big
wicker
in
the
nursery
window
he
was
so
glad
poor
darling
he
has
spent
the
last
three
days
in
bed
the
street
was
full
of
snow
and
the
boys
were
having
a
fine
time
with
their
shovels
their
sleds
and
a
small
terrier
which
pranced
here
and
there
yapping
excitedly
two
of
the
taller
fellows
were
busy
making
a
path
in
front
of
their
house
a
little
chap
with
glowing
cheeks
and
a
red
cap
had
improvised
a
slide
on
the
pavement
while
others
were
engaged
in
a
brisk
snowball
fight
bobsie
pale
but
delighted
watched
everything
with
eager
approbation
the
smartest
dog
he
cried
name
is
buster
come
and
see
elizabeth
if
he
thinks
going
to
hit
him
with
a
snowball
run
away
if
he
thinks
going
to
hit
somebody
else
just
stand
and
bark
and
wag
his
tail
you
fool
buster
do
you
know
his
name
i
asked
boasted
bobs
easy
a
person
who
looks
out
of
windows
as
much
as
me
i
know
all
the
names
too
and
where
they
live
and
whether
they
have
sisters
i
pertend
that
they
are
my
friends
and
that
out
there
playing
with
them
you
can
hardly
tell
the
difference
sometimes
we
have
such
glad
you
do
darling
i
answered
game
do
you
like
best
to
play
that
depends
on
the
time
of
year
answered
robin
judicially
watched
until
i
know
all
about
it
in
summer
there
is
cat
and
base
when
fall
comes
we
have
football
in
the
corner
lot
and
some
of
us
wear
noseguards
then
snowballing
and
sliding
all
winter
and
in
the
spring
marbles
again
only
john
me
play
for
keeps
because
our
mothers
like
is
john
i
asked
the
little
one
with
the
red
cap
sliding
answered
robin
like
him
best
because
he
is
such
a
kind
boy
why
one
day
ellie
when
my
legs
ached
so
i
pertend
to
go
out
even
for
a
few
minutes
john
was
the
only
one
who
missed
me
the
others
kept
right
on
playing
he
stopped
all
of
a
sudden
and
looked
up
at
the
window
and
smiled
so
now
taken
him
for
my
chum
you
honey
i
answered
think
he
must
be
a
very
nice
little
is
agreed
robin
proudly
day
we
broke
the
window
the
cop
chased
us
john
ran
faster
than
anybody
of
course
it
was
easy
for
me
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
pertend
to
dodge
in
here
and
slam
the
door
but
watch
going
to
give
buster
a
ride
now
that
fun
the
terrier
seemed
to
think
it
was
he
kept
his
place
well
in
the
middle
of
the
sled
tail
up
tongue
lolling
while
two
of
the
boys
seized
the
rope
and
followed
by
the
others
made
madly
off
gay
cavalcade
disappearing
noisily
around
the
corner
robin
dropped
back
among
his
pillows
with
a
disappointed
little
sigh
sorry
gone
so
soon
he
said
you
see
i
pertend
to
play
only
on
this
then
he
laid
his
cheek
up
against
my
arm
those
little
boys
must
be
sick
too
they
he
asked
i
guess
pretty
hard
then
for
they
used
to
it
like
me
a
lot
in
being
used
to
a
thing
there
ellie
dear
oh
if
we
could
only
feel
that
robin
was
growing
stronger
i
pray
for
it
every
night
and
so
do
mother
and
haze
and
ernie
i
know
we
to
think
that
he
is
and
tell
each
other
that
it
is
because
of
the
cold
weather
he
feels
wretched
so
much
of
the
time
in
our
secret
well
the
doctor
has
ordered
a
new
kind
of
oil
it
is
very
nasty
and
costs
cents
a
bottle
perhaps
it
will
do
robin
good
wednesday
december
ernie
has
distinguished
herself
again
how
can
she
be
so
naughty
and
mean
any
harm
this
time
geoffrey
is
implicated
too
but
i
can
only
do
justice
to
the
affair
by
constructing
it
from
the
beginning
piecing
together
the
details
as
we
learned
them
in
yesterday
confessional
it
seems
that
the
two
children
were
bitterly
disappointed
a
week
ago
tuesday
when
they
searched
the
for
the
lost
contract
and
found
nothing
more
exciting
than
a
deserted
nest
call
it
a
giddy
sell
remarked
ernie
so
near
to
tears
that
geof
was
honestly
concerned
matter
how
good
you
try
to
be
nor
how
much
you
try
to
help
everything
turns
against
cheer
up
said
geoffrey
ernie
never
looks
more
bewitching
than
when
her
blue
eyes
swim
behind
a
veil
of
suspended
woe
the
good
of
worrying
bunnie
guess
worry
returned
ernie
dolefully
georgie
were
sick
and
your
family
were
poor
and
you
were
responsible
for
making
them
more
so
all
very
well
to
say
up
geoffrey
graham
and
sure
i
do
most
of
the
time
but
this
afternoon
i
want
to
do
something
then
see
here
says
geof
a
bright
idea
striking
him
all
of
a
sudden
got
a
plan
come
up
to
the
workshop
again
where
we
be
interrupted
and
tell
it
something
in
which
i
can
help
asked
ernie
doubtfully
a
pretty
big
undertaking
answered
geof
closing
the
workshop
door
mysteriously
believe
a
girl
has
ever
been
concerned
in
such
an
affair
before
see
here
why
you
and
i
together
uncle
cried
ernie
with
sparkling
eyes
we
truly
do
you
think
see
why
we
answered
geof
seriously
thought
a
lot
about
the
matter
without
supposing
ever
have
the
chance
to
put
it
to
the
test
taken
the
motor
out
and
examined
it
it
is
certainly
a
stunner
and
the
steering
apparatus
seems
simple
enough
you
say
uncle
dudley
really
made
one
ascension
exactly
qualified
ernie
machine
rise
any
distance
at
all
father
was
dreadfully
disappointed
but
later
he
cheered
up
and
said
there
was
just
one
little
detail
that
stood
between
him
and
complete
solution
of
the
problem
of
aërial
i
remember
his
very
words
and
how
excited
we
all
is
what
i
have
always
understood
answered
geof
would
have
perfected
the
thing
if
he
had
lived
long
enough
magnificent
to
contemplate
a
beastly
shame
to
think
of
the
fruits
of
his
genius
lying
up
here
rusting
in
a
totally
unknown
attic
why
you
and
i
take
the
matter
up
where
he
left
it
find
out
the
root
of
the
trouble
one
little
detail
you
say
let
perry
and
his
old
go
hang
it
often
that
geof
waxes
eloquent
when
he
does
he
is
worth
listening
to
can
we
can
jubilated
ernie
clapping
her
hands
geof
a
splendid
scheme
why
has
no
one
thought
of
it
before
have
thought
of
it
often
answered
geoffrey
somehow
up
to
it
seemed
impossible
what
just
told
me
throws
an
entirely
new
light
on
the
matter
and
i
think
we
are
justified
at
least
in
if
we
succeed
says
ernie
need
know
anything
about
so
answered
geof
have
to
do
a
lot
of
hard
studying
and
thinking
and
keep
the
thing
a
deadly
secret
i
tell
you
if
we
do
make
it
go
will
be
worth
and
so
the
conspirators
set
to
work
for
a
week
they
ransacked
library
reading
up
on
aëronautics
generally
studying
every
pamphlet
and
authority
they
could
lay
their
hands
on
there
was
one
thing
that
especially
confused
them
each
man
supported
a
different
theory
as
ernie
plaintively
complained
it
was
extremely
trying
especially
as
dear
father
had
worked
almost
entirely
in
his
head
leaving
very
few
directions
or
specifications
to
guide
them
to
the
right
trail
at
last
geof
declared
that
he
thought
they
would
never
get
anywhere
through
books
that
their
one
hope
lay
in
practical
experiment
ernie
quite
agreed
with
him
and
after
that
they
spent
hours
in
the
airship
mastering
as
they
supposed
the
intricate
details
of
motor
steering
apparatus
and
machinery
geoffrey
even
discovered
what
he
considered
a
slight
error
in
the
automatic
system
of
shifting
weights
finally
last
saturday
morning
behind
closed
doors
the
motor
was
taken
out
and
started
up
it
ran
like
a
dream
they
came
to
the
bold
conclusion
that
nothing
remained
to
hinder
an
experimental
ascension
illustration
and
so
the
conspirators
set
to
work
all
this
time
it
must
be
understood
mother
and
i
had
not
the
faintest
suspicion
as
to
what
was
going
on
we
knew
that
there
was
in
the
workshop
beautiful
surprise
for
the
just
how
great
a
surprise
however
we
neither
of
us
dreamed
yesterday
afternoon
was
the
time
set
for
the
ascension
how
the
two
children
managed
alone
to
raise
the
heavy
machine
from
the
workshop
floor
to
the
roof
by
means
of
the
and
pulleys
father
had
used
in
the
previous
experiment
will
always
remain
a
mystery
but
they
did
at
last
it
stood
among
the
with
rakish
sails
and
scarred
sides
looking
for
all
the
world
like
tipsy
as
ernie
enthusiastically
declared
even
by
this
time
neither
of
the
little
idiots
seems
to
have
had
the
least
realisation
of
it
was
they
were
attempting
on
the
contrary
they
were
quite
wild
with
the
frolic
and
excitement
of
the
thing
geof
straightened
out
the
sails
and
opened
the
manœuvre
valve
sounded
the
motor
the
framework
quivered
response
on
there
shouted
geoffrey
as
he
ran
to
attach
the
short
length
of
anchor
line
to
a
hook
in
the
stone
coping
at
the
front
of
the
roof
get
in
yet
ernie
the
place
in
the
middle
belongs
to
me
got
to
manage
the
steering
right
ernie
answered
climbing
over
the
side
nevertheless
just
looking
to
see
which
of
these
levers
starts
and
then
one
will
ever
know
how
it
happened
geoffrey
had
his
back
turned
ernie
explain
was
a
whiz
a
whirr
deep
in
the
interior
regions
of
the
old
airship
a
sudden
tug
on
the
that
sent
geof
sprawling
into
the
tin
gutter
and
with
a
swoop
entirely
unprecedented
i
believe
in
the
whole
history
of
aërial
ascensions
the
apparatus
had
risen
perhaps
some
twenty
feet
the
voyage
was
begun
ernie
alone
in
the
circled
and
jibed
above
the
geof
regaining
his
feet
made
one
desperate
grab
for
the
it
slipped
through
his
fingers
and
swung
to
the
left
out
of
reach
beyond
the
stone
coping
peggy
aunt
peggy
he
then
bawled
with
such
a
panic
of
woe
in
his
voice
that
mother
who
had
been
sewing
on
new
in
the
nursery
while
i
read
aloud
to
her
and
robin
from
dropped
her
work
to
the
floor
and
fled
up
the
attic
stairs
i
followed
at
top
speed
face
thrust
on
a
long
neck
through
the
in
the
roof
stared
whitely
down
upon
us
his
eyes
and
mouth
were
wide
he
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
gargoyle
he
gasped
got
away
from
me
flying
says
mother
stern
as
any
spartan
you
mad
no
protested
geof
your
head
out
the
window
see
her
i
tried
to
hold
her
down
i
cried
with
one
distraught
comprehensive
look
about
the
dismantled
workshop
at
that
moment
a
clamour
rose
to
us
from
the
street
below
yez
got
er
license
bawled
an
infuriated
irish
voice
down
out
ov
thot
i
yez
only
a
kid
girl
sang
a
shrill
chorus
of
gamins
seen
her
petticoats
in
another
instant
mother
and
i
were
on
the
roof
straining
over
the
stone
coping
some
fifteen
feet
below
us
about
on
a
level
with
the
nursery
window
now
sailed
ernie
she
sat
quite
rigid
in
the
car
which
laboured
and
beat
a
curiously
straight
course
between
the
two
rows
of
houses
directly
down
the
middle
of
the
street
we
could
hear
the
of
the
motor
and
the
excited
comments
of
the
crowd
i
cried
ernie
pallid
countenance
was
raised
to
us
mother
dear
she
wailed
in
plaintive
crescendo
my
pinky
ring
to
mary
hobart
mother
turned
for
a
moment
i
thought
she
was
going
to
jump
off
the
roof
but
instead
she
sped
geof
and
i
at
her
heels
running
it
flying
the
ladder
through
the
workshop
down
two
flights
of
stairs
to
the
second
story
where
throwing
up
a
window
she
reached
out
in
a
vain
attempt
to
grasp
the
short
length
of
dangling
but
already
it
was
too
late
the
car
and
the
crowd
had
passed
by
is
terrible
we
gasped
and
fled
for
the
street
here
high
comedy
reigned
rampant
if
any
one
had
been
in
a
mood
to
appreciate
the
fact
two
policemen
one
stout
and
the
other
tall
and
thin
beat
down
the
block
their
eyes
aloft
bawling
impossible
directions
a
boy
followed
by
a
gang
of
enthusiastic
street
urchins
had
clambered
to
the
roof
of
his
cart
and
moving
slowly
along
directly
beneath
the
labouring
machine
rose
ever
and
again
in
a
series
of
ungainly
but
agile
leaps
clutching
hopefully
at
the
surrounding
atmosphere
in
the
and
gathered
on
the
neighbouring
stoops
were
groups
of
excited
people
rose
escaped
from
the
kitchen
had
climbed
the
hydrant
in
front
of
our
house
where
supported
by
hancock
she
maintained
a
perilous
equilibrium
the
while
she
waved
a
red
cotton
lunch
cloth
and
bellowed
yer
fer
miss
ernie
fer
de
sake
tell
us
whar
yer
fer
while
miss
brown
her
head
wrapped
in
her
pink
knitted
shawl
ran
back
and
forth
clucking
like
a
distraught
hen
she
any
relation
to
you

the
policeman
demanded
of
mother
jerking
his
thumb
severely
skyward
as
he
spoke
daughter
came
the
distracted
response
call
her
down
commanded
the
minion
of
the
law
have
such
on
my
beat
know
how
to
manage
the
machine
mother
said
any
moment
it
may
fall
with
her
what
is
to
be
done
bill
ring
in
an
the
and
an
amberlance
shouted
the
policeman
to
his
mate
at
the
corner
at
the
same
moment
the
airship
as
if
instinct
with
demoniacal
life
ceased
for
an
appreciable
instant
its
laboured
progress
began
to
nose
the
air
uncertainly
and
then
in
a
short
series
of
jerky
swoops
rose
again
and
again
to
an
altitude
of
some
hundred
feet
or
so
there
it
poised
came
about
in
its
sweep
rose
once
more
and
finally
began
to
settle
with
steadily
increasing
velocity
we
stood
spellbound
one
could
literally
hear
the
breathing
of
the
crowd
the
suspense
was
too
horrible
darling
ernie
could
nothing
be
done
to
save
her
below
there
shouted
the
taller
of
the
two
policemen
and
just
then
the
bow
of
the
ship
grazed
the
roof
of
the
corner
house
past
which
it
was
dropping
there
sounded
a
familiar
the
machine
started
off
in
a
new
direction
bumping
along
the
till
finally
with
a
shock
of
tearing
wood
and
a
crash
of
splintered
glass
it
succeeded
in
bunting
its
way
half
through
a
window
midway
of
the
block
where
it
lodged
a
distinct
gasp
of
relief
escaped
from
the
crowd
by
a
feebly
started
cheer
which
rose
and
swelled
in
volume
as
with
clang
of
bell
and
clatter
of
flying
hoofs
the
company
swung
round
the
corner
of
the
street
and
bore
down
upon
us
the
next
few
moments
passed
for
me
in
a
confused
sort
of
dream
when
i
finally
came
to
myself
i
found
that
i
was
sitting
on
the
lowest
step
leading
up
to
the
house
in
the
window
of
which
the
airship
was
lodged
miss
brown
sat
beside
me
firmly
clasping
her
own
hand
the
while
she
murmured
faint
my
love
we
if
your
dear
mother
can
stand
the
strain
everybody
else
should
the
firemen
and
policemen
were
gathered
in
an
official
group
in
the
gutter
and
around
them
sported
and
pranced
a
delighted
bunch
of
mother
had
disappeared
in
another
moment
the
house
door
opened
and
a
whitecapped
maid
came
down
the
stairs
to
say
to
me
mamma
wishes
you
to
go
home
to
your
little
brother
now
miss
the
young
lady
is
quite
safe
inside
they
will
follow
when
the
crowd
has
gone
my
what
a
fright
had
that
there
not
only
broke
the
window
but
tore
out
the
sash
i
thought
it
was
judgment
well
somehow
i
managed
to
get
home
where
i
clasped
trembling
little
robin
in
my
arms
has
happened
ellie
he
sobbed
went
flying
honey
i
answered
and
looked
at
the
clock
the
whole
incident
had
passed
in
exactly
thirteen
minutes
if
i
had
not
the
evidence
of
my
own
eyes
i
should
never
believe
it
finally
the
excitement
subsided
the
crowd
gradually
dispersed
ernie
in
a
quelled
and
chastened
frame
of
mind
her
hand
clasped
tight
in
returned
they
brought
sad
news
of
the
it
seems
that
while
the
policemen
and
crew
still
stood
discussing
the
best
method
of
bringing
it
down
some
three
minutes
after
my
departure
from
the
scene
motor
again
started
up
the
car
took
a
last
fatal
leap
backward
and
fell
two
stories
to
the
street
it
was
shattered
into
so
much
kindling
wood
which
goes
to
show
just
how
much
we
have
to
be
thankful
for
dear
grieved
ernie
plaintively
could
have
suspected
our
surprise
would
turn
out
so
geoffrey
has
anybody
seen
him
it
appeared
upon
investigation
that
geof
had
been
to
the
to
inquire
all
were
well
he
was
very
white
and
rose
said
and
seemed
ashamed
to
come
in
i
should
have
liked
it
better
if
he
had
come
and
faced
mother
on
the
spot
but
instead
he
sneaked
off
home
is
certainly
a
queer
fellow
in
some
ways
that
evening
confessed
the
whole
affair
to
uncle
george
asking
for
money
to
pay
whatever
damages
we
are
responsible
for
and
legal
protection
for
himself
and
ernie
for
he
imagined
that
they
were
in
some
way
publicly
liable
and
might
be
arrested
at
any
moment
uncle
george
was
very
angry
the
more
so
since
any
display
of
inventive
activity
on
part
is
extremely
distasteful
to
him
he
called
upon
mother
this
morning
to
acquire
further
details
and
remarked
with
a
flourish
of
his
cane
that
he
had
geof
uncle
george
is
always
primitive
and
generally
mother
disapproves
of
his
methods
but
this
time
she
returned
with
a
flash
of
her
maternal
eye
that
was
just
what
geoffrey
nevertheless
she
herself
believes
in
what
might
be
called
punishments
so
ernie
took
her
dinner
in
bed
last
night
where
she
would
have
plenty
of
time
to
think
while
answered
the
questions
of
the
boarders
and
haze
interviewed
quite
a
string
of
enterprising
reporters
on
her
behalf
he
really
managed
rather
well
i
fancy
and
finally
convinced
them
that
there
was
not
much
of
a
the
matter
however
did
not
end
there
for
ernie
for
this
afternoon
when
she
came
home
from
school
mother
called
her
into
the
nursery
and
pointing
to
the
pretty
plaid
dress
on
which
she
had
been
working
when
the
excitement
began
remarked
dear
since
you
are
so
anxious
to
be
helpful
i
shall
let
you
finish
your
dress
yourself
the
material
is
cut
and
the
lining
basted
i
will
give
whatever
directions
you
may
need
but
dressmaking
is
not
nearly
so
difficult
an
art
as
the
construction
of
besides
if
you
are
busy
with
your
needle
i
shall
not
worry
about
poor
ernie
her
face
was
a
study
she
simply
hates
sewing
makes
her
toes
prick
she
says
also
it
will
mean
giving
up
all
her
playtime
for
weeks
to
come
and
she
must
be
careful
and
not
botch
since
she
will
have
to
wear
the
result
of
her
labours
on
the
whole
i
think
her
punishment
was
even
more
severe
than
but
neither
of
the
culprits
complains
rather
they
about
the
house
in
such
a
beatific
state
of
christian
humility
that
one
knows
it
can
not
last
believe
in
hitting
a
fellow
when
down
remarked
haze
to
me
this
evening
glad
they
realise
what
done
apart
from
the
frightful
publicity
of
the
thing
i
the
there
is
nothing
to
keep
the
draughts
off
my
head
at
night
and
the
workshop
is
not
what
it
was
thursday
december
this
afternoon
mother
called
on
burroughs
she
is
the
lady
whose
house
ernie
broke
into
with
the
and
i
forgot
to
say
how
lovely
she
was
about
it
of
course
as
ernie
admitted
mother
intended
calling
yesterday
to
arrange
about
the
broken
glass
which
fortunately
uncle
george
said
he
would
pay
she
was
flat
poor
dear
with
a
nervous
headache
and
so
had
to
put
it
off
ernie
was
rather
shaken
too
and
robin
quite
excited
and
feverish
as
he
continued
to
have
a
little
this
morning
i
did
not
give
him
his
reading
lesson
till
afternoon
he
is
really
getting
on
very
nicely
when
one
considers
the
disadvantages
against
which
he
has
to
fight
only
his
ill
health
but
he
has
had
so
many
stories
read
to
him
and
is
so
far
advanced
for
his
age
in
other
ways
that
it
is
hard
for
him
to
read
see
a
cat
does
the
cat
see
me
if
he
did
not
wish
to
crush
rising
conceit
i
think
we
would
have
a
struggle
teaching
him
he
said
to
me
when
the
lesson
was
over
ellie
i
do
hate
cats
but
rosebud
and
sighed
prodigiously
it
is
amusing
to
hear
robin
sigh
he
is
such
a
little
boy
and
the
sigh
is
so
very
big
i
told
him
he
would
make
an
invaluable
passenger
aboard
a
sailing
vessel
for
if
the
wind
died
down
it
would
only
be
necessary
for
him
to
sigh
once
or
twice
to
blow
the
ship
right
into
port
this
idea
tickled
him
mightily
and
he
sighed
again
even
louder
than
before
and
then
he
said
he
would
tell
me
a
story
i
love
stories
are
so
original
here
is
the
one
he
told
this
afternoon
there
was
a
crusader
and
his
name
was
max
and
he
lived
up
a
tree
in
the
holy
sort
of
a
tree
robin
i
asked
was
a
bobs
replied
there
were
chestnuts
on
it
and
and
peanuts
too
the
crusader
and
the
squirrels
what
lived
with
him
used
to
eat
them
all
day
long
but
one
time
the
squirrels
had
gone
out
on
a
visit
and
the
crusader
was
sitting
on
a
branch
alone
and
he
saw
a
griffin
go
by
and
the
griffin
was
muttering
and
murmuring
to
his
self
you
wait
my
fine
lady
till
i
get
home
and
then
i
have
you
for
my
tea
oh
ho
my
fine
madam
just
you
wait
and
then
see
so
max
he
knew
right
away
that
that
meant
a
princess
and
he
slid
down
the
trunk
of
the
tree
he
ran
right
up
to
him
he
shouted
in
his
ear
that
princess
you
have
hid
the
griffin
jumped
but
then
he
pertended
it
was
only
a
burr
what
he
had
in
his
foot
and
he
said
princess
i
any
princess
my
dear
fellow
what
are
you
about
just
then
max
he
heard
a
sobbing
sound
which
was
the
princess
weeping
and
he
shouted
my
not
much
you
i
hear
her
crying
this
very
instant
if
you
tell
me
where
she
is
i
shall
cut
your
head
slam
bang
off
the
griffin
he
was
clever
and
he
said
do
you
mean
old
nosey
why
only
my
sick
grandmother
that
you
hear
she
has
an
influenza
and
so
to
sniff
the
crusader
was
not
so
easily
fooled
as
all
that
and
he
took
up
his
sword
he
cut
off
the
head
bang
and
then
he
looked
around
for
the
princess
after
a
while
he
found
her
in
a
pit
what
the
griffin
had
dug
and
then
the
crusader
and
the
princess
and
the
squirrels
all
went
and
lived
in
the
castle
the
princess
know
how
to
climb
trees
and
anyhow
max
was
tired
of
just
as
bobsie
finished
his
story
mother
came
in
from
her
call
and
as
we
wanted
to
hear
all
about
it
she
took
him
in
her
lap
in
the
big
rocker
while
i
seated
myself
on
the
hassock
at
her
feet
burroughs
she
said
was
charming
cordial
and
friendly
and
would
not
listen
to
anything
about
she
seemed
endlessly
amused
at
escapade
and
laughed
and
laughed
over
it
then
she
would
break
off
to
apologise
and
say
she
fully
realised
how
great
the
shock
must
have
been
to
us
some
freshly
funny
aspect
of
the
adventure
would
strike
her
she
would
laugh
again
and
mother
would
laugh
too
finally
they
began
to
talk
of
other
things
it
seems
that
burroughs
had
had
a
little
boy
who
was
an
invalid
his
name
was
francis
he
was
ill
for
five
years
with
some
spinal
trouble
and
died
when
he
was
seven
mother
told
me
the
sadder
details
later
for
robin
takes
his
illness
so
much
as
a
matter
of
course
that
we
never
like
to
say
anything
before
him
that
would
be
apt
to
make
him
realise
or
arouse
apprehensions
husband
had
died
some
years
previous
and
so
she
was
left
quite
alone
except
for
an
aunt
an
old
lady
of
nearly
seventy
who
fortunately
was
out
making
calls
tuesday
afternoon
and
so
escaped
the
excitement
of
invasion
burroughs
then
asked
mother
a
number
of
questions
about
robin
she
said
she
had
often
noticed
his
little
pale
face
at
the
nursery
window
as
she
passed
our
house
and
she
wondered
if
he
ever
got
out
mother
answered
that
we
could
not
let
him
go
very
often
this
winter
for
he
took
cold
so
easily
and
his
crutches
seemed
to
tire
him
then
burroughs
flushed
a
beautiful
rose
colour
hesitated
and
said
in
a
breathless
little
way
that
her
boy
francis
had
had
a
for
the
last
couple
of
years
of
his
illness
from
which
he
had
gotten
a
great
deal
of
comfort
and
pleasure
she
had
often
wondered
seeing
robin
at
the
window
if
it
would
not
be
nice
for
him
too
half
a
dozen
times
she
said
she
had
been
on
the
point
of
sending
it
over
it
shall
come
to
him
this
evening
i
know
what
has
held
me
back
so
long
you
will
let
your
dear
little
son
accept
it
as
a
gift
from
my
francis
will
you
not
graham
she
pleaded
have
no
feeling
about
taking
presents
from
one
another
i
should
be
so
very
very
glad
for
francis
always
loved
to
give
of
course
mother
could
make
but
one
answer
how
splendid
the
chair
will
be
for
robin
now
he
can
get
out
on
the
mild
sunny
days
which
was
impossible
for
him
when
he
was
dependent
only
on
sled
dear
little
fellow
is
delighted
with
the
prospect
and
we
have
great
hopes
of
the
good
it
will
do
him
and
how
kind
of
burroughs
to
think
of
it
and
offer
it
the
way
she
did
any
hint
of
patronage
or
condescension
she
also
asked
with
what
mother
called
hungry
if
she
might
not
run
in
sometime
and
make
acquaintance
and
she
invited
ernie
and
me
to
call
upon
her
too
i
shall
love
to
go
and
even
ernie
admits
that
perhaps
it
be
so
bad
since
burroughs
seems
to
be
delicate
sort
of
who
understands
how
really
it
is
rather
pathetic
the
way
ernie
has
brightened
up
since
we
have
had
the
offer
of
the
chair
i
think
in
her
secret
heart
she
considers
herself
responsible
sort
of
unappreciated
ex
as
it
were
and
certainly
it
is
an
unlooked
for
and
lovely
end
to
what
might
have
proven
a
very
terrible
adventure
saturday
december
the
sun
shone
bright
and
beautiful
this
morning
there
was
no
wind
and
the
streets
were
clear
of
snow
so
bobsie
went
for
a
ride
in
his
new
what
do
you
think
he
wore
the
dearest
little
overcoat
and
a
fur
cap
with
a
military
cockade
almost
the
exact
duplicate
of
those
belonging
to
georgie
which
i
was
mean
enough
to
envy
the
last
time
he
came
to
see
us
this
is
the
way
it
happened
the
did
not
come
from
burroughs
thursday
evening
as
we
had
hoped
robin
kept
watching
for
it
and
listening
for
the
bell
i
waited
too
but
all
in
vain
i
know
which
of
us
went
to
bed
the
more
disappointed
the
next
day
friday
it
rained
robin
could
not
have
gone
out
under
any
circumstances
it
was
not
until
late
in
the
afternoon
after
hours
of
waiting
that
the
chair
finally
arrived
it
was
left
at
the
basement
door
by
maid
with
a
big
bundle
and
a
little
note
mother
read
the
note
while
i
undid
the
bundle
cutting
all
the
strings
you
may
be
sure
and
wondering
what
it
might
contain
inside
the
wrapping
paper
there
was
a
dear
little
steamer
rug
a
pretty
serviceable
plaid
and
warm
as
warm
can
be
then
came
the
overcoat
the
fur
cap
with
close
just
such
as
they
are
wearing
this
winter
and
a
charming
pair
of
gloves
but
we
accept
so
much
bobs
said
mother
and
read
the
note
aloud
dear
robin
which
i
am
sending
and
the
coat
and
cap
belonged
to
a
little
boy
whom
i
wish
you
might
have
known
and
loved
his
name
was
francis
if
you
had
known
him
you
could
not
have
helped
loving
him
i
am
sure
he
was
sick
a
great
deal
of
the
time
like
you
and
always
so
patient
and
good
your
mother
tells
me
that
you
are
good
too
and
that
is
why
i
want
you
to
have
his
things
i
had
to
alter
the
coat
and
cap
a
little
or
you
would
have
had
them
before
this
for
my
francis
always
liked
his
clothes
just
so
the
very
latest
style
perhaps
you
feel
that
way
too
please
wear
them
i
hope
you
will
enjoy
the
chair
very
much
it
will
make
me
happier
to
know
that
another
little
boy
is
making
use
of
my
things
love
to
your
mother
and
yourself
believe
me
friend
clara
cecilia
now
was
not
that
a
lovely
note
you
take
the
things
bobsie
dear
said
mother
i
will
answered
bobs
with
a
sympathetic
sniff
he
had
felt
the
sadness
underlying
the
gentle
words
and
stood
quite
grave
and
serious
as
we
tried
on
the
coat
and
gloves
they
fitted
as
if
they
had
been
made
for
him
and
how
charming
our
robin
looked
have
to
be
very
good
when
i
wear
these
he
remarked
quaintly
alas
for
resolutions
as
i
said
we
took
our
first
walk
this
morning
and
robin
was
so
comfortable
in
his
new
chair
with
the
steamer
rug
tucked
close
about
his
little
thin
legs
the
street
was
full
of
his
and
bobs
beamed
on
them
with
gracious
condescension
a
pretty
glow
of
excitement
burned
in
his
cheeks
his
eyes
were
bright
as
stars
he
did
not
look
like
a
little
invalid
boy
will
think
i
am
riding
just
because
i
am
so
rich
he
remarked
looking
down
at
his
gloves
that
moment
turning
the
corner
of
washington
square
whom
should
we
meet
but
georgie
and
his
nurse
out
for
a
morning
stroll
too
says
georgie
his
eyes
nearly
popping
out
of
his
head
with
amazement
you
get
those
things
for
naturally
he
had
never
seen
bobs
attired
so
gorgeously
before
gave
to
me
answered
robin
loftily
boy
questioned
georgie
and
then
before
robin
had
time
to
reply
i
take
coats
things
from
anybody
just
my
papa
be
ashamed
to
wear
other
clothes
you
not
the
way
i
do
shouted
robin
with
flashing
eyes
coat
belongs
to
an
angel
like
to
have
you
know
and
let
you
wear
it
too
bad
robin
i
cried
would
francis
think
if
he
could
hear
you
now
robin
instantly
subsided
and
indeed
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
say
more
georgie
was
quite
quelled
and
done
for
the
idea
of
the
angel
coat
was
more
than
he
could
grapple
with
he
walked
along
beside
the
chair
in
a
state
of
wondering
but
subdued
solemnity
after
a
while
he
began
timidly
to
stroke
the
fur
on
cuff
it
warm
he
asked
it
is
answered
robin
still
a
trifle
defiant
you
tell
georgie
about
the
things
i
said
robin
was
clever
enough
to
appreciate
that
the
impression
he
had
created
though
delightful
to
his
vanity
was
not
strictly
in
accordance
with
fact
he
muttered
unwillingly
is
an
angel
now
and
this
was
his
coat
and
sick
like
he
was
and
good
too
and
why
i
be
ashamed
to
wear
long
as
you
good
i
answered
and
robin
blushed
and
hung
his
head
while
georgie
sighed
he
did
not
entirely
understand
even
yet
but
somehow
the
tension
of
his
prosaic
little
mind
was
relieved
nevertheless
he
was
very
respectful
and
polite
to
robin
all
the
rest
of
the
walk
and
the
explanation
must
have
set
him
thinking
i
suppose
for
this
afternoon
while
bobs
was
upstairs
taking
a
nap
who
should
appear
at
our
door
but
georgie
this
time
under
the
care
of
william
the
coloured
butler
he
said
handing
me
a
square
package
prettily
done
up
with
tissue
paper
and
red
ribbon
is
for
bobbie
because
he
is
sick
tell
him
the
one
with
the
picture
of
the
tiger
he
likes
that
best
but
i
like
the
brownie
thank
you
georgie
dear
i
said
kissing
his
little
ruddy
face
made
you
think
to
bring
it
over
wanted
him
to
have
something
to
himself
with
said
georgie
mamma
said
i
might
if
only
i
would
stop
was
very
kind
of
you
honey
i
answered
and
georgie
beamed
sometimes
i
am
ready
to
admit
that
i
am
unjust
to
georgie
it
his
fault
that
he
has
all
the
things
i
want
for
robin
to
be
sure
and
now
i
must
write
something
that
i
dread
to
put
down
in
black
and
white
there
is
no
use
shirking
we
have
to
face
it
the
hancocks
are
going
the
news
came
quite
unexpectedly
to
us
all
and
it
is
fault
hancock
saw
mother
this
evening
and
explained
that
married
sister
had
come
to
the
city
and
taken
a
furnished
house
and
it
had
always
been
understood
between
them
that
when
this
happened
she
and
hancock
would
rent
a
floor
she
said
she
was
really
sorry
to
leave
us
that
she
had
no
complaints
to
make
but
they
were
anxious
to
be
settled
before
christmas
and
felt
obliged
to
give
up
their
rooms
next
saturday
that
would
give
us
a
whole
week
in
which
to
rent
them
and
she
hoped
we
would
have
no
trouble
but
oh
dear
we
even
had
any
applications
for
room
yet
it
seems
to
be
an
unlucky
season
or
something
and
when
the
hancocks
go
i
see
how
we
are
going
to
get
on
at
all
we
will
have
only
miss
brown
left
and
she
pays
less
than
anybody
else
because
her
room
is
so
small
can
a
family
of
seven
people
live
on
ten
dollars
a
week
that
sounds
like
a
problem
in
a
magazine
but
i
fancy
the
answer
will
prove
very
different
from
those
printed
if
we
are
unlucky
enough
to
have
to
try
it
have
such
a
queer
feeling
whenever
i
look
at
miss
brown
confessed
ernie
as
we
put
away
the
dinner
dishes
having
begged
for
an
unexpected
afternoon
out
of
as
if
we
were
a
cannibal
family
and
she
was
the
last
captive
we
had
left
just
think
she
means
muttonchops
and
beefsteak
and
milk
for
robin
and
butter
and
eggs
and
everything
except
rent
we
must
guard
her
carefully
elizabeth
and
see
to
it
that
she
does
not
escape
poor
miss
brown
i
had
had
somewhat
the
same
feeling
myself
though
i
would
not
have
thought
of
expressing
it
in
exactly
words
i
think
mother
must
have
guessed
from
our
faces
how
worried
we
were
for
as
soon
as
the
dishes
were
finished
she
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
began
to
play
the
jolliest
lot
of
college
airs
and
soon
we
were
all
singing
and
laughing
to
hear
us
you
have
thought
we
had
a
care
in
the
world
certainly
for
a
time
we
forgot
we
had
even
haze
shut
up
his
cæsar
and
joined
in
the
frolic
now
that
exactly
like
mother
no
one
but
her
think
it
out
together
elizabeth
she
whispered
as
i
bade
her
worry
monday
december
mother
and
i
have
had
our
consultation
and
we
feel
better
it
was
rather
like
a
general
and
his
adjutant
preparing
for
a
siege
first
we
mustered
our
resources
house
so
much
coal
in
the
cellar
furnace
and
range
miss
seven
dollars
a
week
three
next
the
demands
that
were
to
be
met
always
an
expensive
item
at
this
season
of
the
year
milk
for
robin
and
the
table
expenses
generally
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
dispense
with
rose
said
mother
pencil
on
lip
from
the
question
of
wages
she
eats
a
great
deal
at
this
we
could
not
help
laughing
the
parsimonious
picture
presented
was
certainly
ludicrous
on
an
income
of
ten
dollars
a
week
every
potato
counts
and
rose
has
never
been
either
efficient
or
economical
we
have
kept
her
for
her
cheapness
and
general
good
temper
she
has
washed
the
dishes
cooked
after
a
fashion
and
attended
a
many
funerals
the
more
the
merrier
ma
boy
dis
time
graham
she
explained
to
mother
saturday
afternoon
no
very
close
kin
to
some
way
ob
ah
know
but
one
them
that
believes
in
up
the
dispectability
ob
the
fambly
tie
ah
go
of
course
mother
answered
that
she
might
and
consequently
ernie
and
i
washed
the
dinner
dishes
so
though
perhaps
rose
will
be
sorry
to
leave
us
since
she
once
confessed
to
robin
in
an
unconsidered
burst
of
confidence
she
considers
us
right
fambly
to
do
fer
we
can
not
feel
that
she
will
be
much
of
a
loss
and
as
we
know
she
can
get
a
place
any
time
she
wants
it
with
her
sister
a
swell
house
in
the
we
are
relieved
of
responsibility
on
that
score
so
now
it
is
settled
after
next
saturday
when
the
hancocks
leave
we
are
to
do
everything
ourselves
washing
cooking
sweeping
and
all
i
say
that
i
look
forward
to
the
experiment
with
any
particular
but
mother
is
great
to
work
with
and
somehow
pull
through
you
will
be
willing
to
admit
by
this
time
elizabeth
remarked
haze
this
evening
looking
up
from
i
was
right
and
you
were
wrong
my
salary
comes
in
pretty
conveniently
just
at
present
eh
certainly
salary
is
one
of
the
things
we
are
counting
on
for
all
that
i
help
grieving
over
him
poor
dear
though
he
does
not
utter
a
word
of
complaint
i
know
he
realises
more
keenly
every
day
the
magnitude
of
the
sacrifice
he
has
made
he
was
not
cut
out
for
a
and
finds
it
hard
to
adjust
himself
to
the
new
conditions
this
very
morning
he
was
in
trouble
over
if
you
please
ernie
got
the
book
from
the
public
library
saturday
expecting
to
read
it
herself
but
unfortunately
when
she
went
to
yesterday
afternoon
she
left
it
lying
open
on
the
workshop
table
haze
strolled
in
carelessly
picked
it
up
and
began
to
read
naturally
when
ernie
came
home
a
couple
of
hours
later
she
demanded
her
story
pleadings
and
protestations
were
of
no
avail
hazard
would
not
even
answer
he
was
deaf
to
all
remarks
so
ernie
lost
patience
at
last
and
tried
to
snatch
the
book
away
at
which
haze
rose
dazed
yet
dignified
placed
it
on
his
chair
and
calmly
sat
down
on
it
think
too
mean
for
anything
cried
ernie
with
flashing
eyes
any
to
take
my
story
and
keep
it
from
me
just
because
you
are
stronger
than
i
am
be
a
dog
in
the
manger
returned
hazard
loftily
possibly
expect
to
read
the
thing
while
sitting
on
it
can
you
go
away
and
find
something
useful
to
do
only
wasting
both
our
time
here
and
naturally
when
finished
it
give
it
ernie
stamped
and
fumed
quite
unable
to
appreciate
the
fine
logic
of
this
position
but
haze
sat
stolidly
on
till
at
last
she
gave
in
is
always
a
generous
child
hazard
arose
resumed
his
story
and
read
rabidly
till
bedtime
even
so
however
he
did
not
finish
the
book
and
took
it
with
him
this
morning
to
read
on
the
trolley
consequence
of
which
he
was
carried
seven
blocks
out
of
his
way
and
arrived
a
quarter
of
an
hour
late
at
the
office
bridges
who
is
something
of
a
disciplinarian
and
determined
to
show
no
partiality
on
him
like
he
confessed
to
ernie
and
me
this
evening
of
course
says
haze
i
objected
to
the
language
he
used
i
was
not
in
a
position
to
resent
it
comes
of
being
an
office
boy
mind
purred
nice
little
ernie
immediately
forgetful
of
any
rancour
she
herself
may
have
been
cherishing
day
surprise
them
all
hazard
they
appreciate
you
yet
dear
we
know
we
elizabeth
just
let
wait
a
bit
and
see
thursday
december
tuesday
i
received
an
invitation
from
aunt
adelaide
to
dine
with
them
yesterday
evening
i
was
to
bring
my
mandolin
and
after
dinner
meta
and
i
were
to
play
from
the
fairy
music
is
very
pretty
on
the
mandolin
there
were
to
be
a
number
of
guests
an
englishman
and
his
wife
a
railroad
president
and
several
others
aunt
adelaide
extends
me
one
or
two
such
informal
invitations
each
winter
i
expect
she
considers
it
her
duty
which
it
lends
support
to
meta
and
two
mandolins
are
better
than
one
naturally
the
first
question
was
as
to
clothes
aunt
adelaide
sees
to
it
that
two
or
three
of
last
dresses
are
sent
to
me
spring
and
fall
they
are
always
always
pretty
and
as
we
are
very
nearly
of
a
size
they
require
little
alteration
yet
somehow
i
hate
to
wear
them
in
their
native
habitat
where
i
am
perpetually
haunted
by
the
discomforting
suggestion
that
they
must
be
fatally
familiar
to
all
however
it
is
expected
and
ernie
declares
that
i
ought
to
be
grateful
since
i
am
thus
with
a
wardrobe
far
above
my
she
is
too
young
to
understand
that
that
is
just
what
i
do
not
like
last
evening
i
wore
a
graceful
little
white
surah
frilled
frock
garnished
with
artificial
the
idea
for
a
girl
who
expects
to
start
in
on
the
come
monday
uncle
house
as
i
have
remarked
before
is
very
imposing
there
is
a
magnificent
display
of
windows
a
flight
of
broad
stone
steps
and
a
really
oppressive
vestibule
i
was
admitted
by
william
the
coloured
man
who
took
my
instrument
and
told
me
that
meta
was
above
stairs
would
i
please
go
right
up
such
a
charming
room
as
meta
has
rose
and
mossy
green
with
soft
rugs
a
desk
a
bookcase
her
favourite
casts
and
photographs
everything
individual
and
personal
seems
to
me
the
greatest
treat
of
all
in
she
answered
to
my
knock
and
turned
half
round
before
the
a
pout
upon
her
pretty
face
meta
i
cried
charming
for
the
dress
of
which
she
was
evidently
trying
the
effect
before
the
mirror
was
truly
lovely
nile
green
rajah
silk
with
lace
and
a
touch
of
amber
fluff
at
the
throat
you
think
so
returned
meta
really
seen
it
yet
come
and
look
how
this
shoulder
pulls
now
that
jar
you
much
amiss
i
answered
underseam
wants
to
be
let
out
a
little
declare
give
miss
murray
fits
returned
meta
her
face
flushing
unpleasantly
was
all
i
could
do
to
get
her
to
promise
the
thing
for
and
then
to
send
it
home
like
this
a
big
fake
working
on
sympathies
with
that
cough
of
hers
going
to
change
elizabeth
see
if
i
all
the
girls
are
going
to
madam
delahasset
now
and
i
see
why
i
should
be
made
to
look
like
a
frump
just
because
miss
murray
is
delicate
and
has
a
pair
of
aged
parents
to
support
exaggerating
meta
i
returned
is
nothing
the
least
frumpish
about
that
frock
the
prettiest
thing
i
have
seen
in
ages
as
to
the
shoulder
easily
remedied
and
might
have
happened
with
any
you
really
think
so
asked
meta
uncertainly
of
course
i
do
i
replied
what
is
more
i
think
miss
murray
is
a
so
and
glad
you
like
it
admitted
meta
who
is
not
difficult
to
bring
around
if
only
one
is
firm
enough
believes
in
her
but
there
is
nothing
that
upsets
me
so
much
as
a
new
frock
see
my
amber
buckle
be
the
very
ticket
with
this
girdle
stunning
i
returned
and
threw
my
hat
and
gloves
upon
the
bed
look
well
yourself
elizabeth
continued
meta
turning
in
hand
to
sweep
me
an
approving
glance
i
never
appreciate
how
nice
my
things
are
till
i
see
them
on
you
those
bunches
of
for
instance
look
half
so
cute
when
i
wore
them
but
mercy
have
you
been
doing
with
your
hands
i
was
forced
to
admit
they
very
bad
returned
meta
in
dubious
assent
matter
so
much
if
we
have
to
play
you
ever
use
cold
cream
and
then
quickly
before
i
had
time
to
reply
can
you
bear
it
elizabeth
now
life
i
mean
life
i
questioned
want
me
to
answer
honestly
well
first
place
interesting
one
never
has
a
moment
to
be
bored
of
course
there
are
plenty
of
worries
and
a
good
deal
happens
that
one
like
but
the
planning
is
exciting
and
the
sense
of
battle
then
too
there
are
such
lots
of
things
convinced
that
nothing
develops
sense
of
humour
like
being
poor
it
teaches
one
to
love
family
and
gives
one
plenty
of
chance
to
show
it
too
without
being
sentimental
and
oh
good
training
in
other
ways
for
instance
it
would
take
a
lot
more
than
a
new
frock
to
upset
me
meta
here
i
stopped
amazed
either
it
was
pride
that
made
me
answer
so
or
i
had
suddenly
discovered
that
being
poor
is
not
altogether
such
bad
luck
i
who
have
kicked
so
determinedly
against
the
pricks
for
the
luxuries
we
afford
of
georgie
because
for
him
they
are
afforded
well
i
must
do
better
now
since
among
the
thorns
there
are
roses
to
be
found
why
not
pluck
and
wear
them
meta
still
stood
before
the
mirror
trying
the
effect
of
the
amber
buckle
understand
a
word
been
saying
she
confessed
afraid
talking
through
your
hat
elizabeth
but
come
on
go
down
ready
since
you
think
my
rags
will
and
we
proceeded
to
the
where
we
found
aunt
adelaide
and
a
number
of
guests
already
assembled
geof
did
not
appear
till
dinner
was
announced
he
sat
next
me
and
after
an
unenthusiastic
greeting
began
upon
the
oysters
it
was
evident
he
was
in
one
of
his
moods
hockey
coming
on
geof
i
asked
under
cover
of
the
general
conversation
not
coming
on
at
all
returned
geof
glumly
play
any
more
this
i
replied
for
geof
is
captain
of
his
school
team
a
crack
player
fast
and
wonderfully
clever
even
the
lakeville
match
i
thought
you
had
it
all
arranged
we
have
muttered
geof
crumbling
a
bit
of
bread
between
his
fingers
come
off
all
right
a
different
captain
geoffrey
i
said
for
i
saw
by
his
face
and
the
nervous
movements
of
his
hand
how
deeply
the
matter
cut
has
happened
not
in
trouble
again
at
school
get
on
all
right
at
school
returned
geof
sullenly
only
stop
nagging
at
home
it
seems
the
not
pleased
with
my
reports
especially
blame
him
for
that
the
gone
forth
that
i
am
to
give
up
athletics
place
on
the
team
and
all
put
up
to
it
of
course
sharp
enough
to
know
geoffrey
i
said
scholarship
is
the
only
difficulty
why
you
buckle
down
and
study
aunt
adelaide
is
really
anxious
about
you
her
motives
are
good
after
all
the
matter
rests
in
your
own
hands
hockey
as
that
is
objected
to
you
know
geof
turned
from
me
i
saw
that
i
would
receive
no
further
answer
and
yet
i
felt
sorry
for
the
poor
fellow
stubborn
and
headstrong
as
i
know
him
to
be
when
we
returned
to
the
meta
geof
and
i
retired
to
a
where
we
felt
ourselves
screened
from
observation
evenings
are
so
dull
meta
began
plaintively
puts
on
best
clothes
and
then
nothing
happens
at
all
seventeen
is
a
hateful
age
anyway
it
seems
to
me
one
is
not
grown
up
and
yet
one
is
no
longer
a
kid
fancy
elizabeth
mamma
says
i
am
not
to
come
out
till
i
am
twenty
did
you
ever
hear
anything
so
unjust
all
this
talk
about
education
makes
me
you
have
to
complain
of
jeered
geof
fudge
party
every
other
week
and
girls
so
thick
about
the
house
one
move
without
stepping
on
not
trying
to
infringe
your
patent
replied
meta
smartly
you
know
elizabeth
that
geof
has
taken
out
a
patent
on
martyrdom
since
been
forbidden
athletics
he
has
even
got
to
give
up
his
beloved
hockey
a
national
misfortune
let
me
tell
all
you
know
about
it
returned
geof
expect
you
to
understand
anyhow
you
an
atom
of
sport
in
your
he
raised
an
excited
arm
as
he
spoke
and
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
struck
meta
rather
sharply
on
the
side
of
the
head
i
should
have
laughed
had
i
been
in
her
place
for
it
was
not
really
much
of
a
blow
and
we
were
crowded
so
against
the
that
accidents
were
only
natural
but
she
cried
out
stop
that
you
hurt
me
and
uncle
george
who
was
standing
near
enough
to
overhear
the
exclamation
turned
and
rumbled
in
that
heavy
bass
of
his
you
teasing
your
sister
sir
leave
the
room
you
conduct
yourself
like
a
geof
jumped
up
and
looked
at
meta
as
if
expecting
her
to
explain
i
waited
too
but
never
a
word
did
she
say
then
geoffrey
very
red
and
stormy
walked
toward
the
door
how
sorry
i
felt
for
every
one
had
turned
at
uncle
voice
and
it
sounded
brutal
way
one
would
order
a
dog
i
whispered
could
you
it
was
an
know
that
perfectly
well
meta
raised
her
hand
to
her
hair
with
an
airy
little
laugh
mussed
my
pompadour
all
the
same
she
explained
besides
geof
will
understand
he
knows
perfectly
well
that
i
owed
him
i
turned
away
shocked
and
disgusted
and
presently
aunt
adelaide
asked
us
to
play
the
music
went
well
enough
people
applauded
and
declared
it
delightful
but
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
the
evening
had
proved
anything
but
a
success
about
nine
i
made
my
and
was
conducted
home
under
the
wing
of
the
dignified
and
william
well
i
had
not
had
a
pleasant
time
but
i
think
i
learned
a
lesson
question
and
my
unexpected
answer
in
return
certainly
there
advantages
in
being
poor
under
given
circumstances
one
would
have
to
be
so
very
selfish
to
be
selfish
at
all
that
that
in
itself
is
a
safeguard
poor
geof
poor
meta
i
lay
awake
and
thought
of
them
late
into
the
night
they
waste
so
much
that
is
good
and
pleasant
and
are
not
nearly
as
happy
as
any
of
us
whom
they
often
pity
i
feel
sure
friday
december
this
morning
as
rose
was
sweeping
the
pavement
in
front
of
our
house
she
was
accosted
by
a
small
boy
with
ruddy
cheeks
and
a
red
cap
he
dead
asked
the
small
boy
his
head
interrogatively
to
one
side
a
light
in
his
twinkling
blue
eyes
says
rose
with
a
little
skip
him
specified
the
small
boy
ungrammatically
insistent
little
chap
which
used
to
sit
in
the
winder
and
watch
us
play
i
seen
him
for
three
course
he
dead
answered
rose
indignantly
for
with
all
her
faults
she
is
very
fond
of
robin
guess
he
can
stay
in
bed
if
he
without
you
shoo
get
along
and
she
swished
viciously
at
the
boy
with
her
broom
give
him
this
cried
the
one
hopping
nimbly
to
safety
in
the
gutter
and
rolled
a
great
golden
orange
to
her
feet
bought
it
with
my
own
pennies
to
eat
in
school
but
rather
he
had
it
long
as
he
and
he
walked
whistling
down
the
street
it
was
john
to
be
sure
how
bobsie
enjoy
that
orange
everybody
who
has
such
good
friends
as
me
he
remarked
with
gusto
between
unctuous
sucks
burroughs
who
sends
over
chairs
things
just
when
you
least
expect
it
and
francis
who
wants
me
to
have
she
said
i
might
count
him
georgie
even
if
we
do
fight
sometimes
my
chum
john
pleasant
to
have
people
love
you
it
ellie
dear
very
comforting
in
one
instance
certainly
the
comfort
seems
to
be
mutual
burroughs
has
run
in
to
see
robin
several
times
this
last
week
they
laugh
and
chatter
away
together
in
the
jolliest
fashion
indeed
it
is
quite
delightful
to
hear
them
for
bobs
has
not
a
particle
of
shyness
with
his
new
friend
while
she
seems
to
find
an
almost
painful
pleasure
in
his
society
the
more
we
see
her
the
sweeter
we
think
her
and
there
was
not
a
dissenting
voice
when
ernie
declared
this
evening
that
burroughs
is
next
door
to
an
saturday
december
rose
left
us
this
afternoon
with
many
protestations
of
affectionate
ever
you
me
call
upon
me
graham
she
said
to
mother
ready
to
come
back
any
time
at
a
and
no
questions
i
must
say
it
seemed
rather
nice
to
have
the
kitchen
to
ourselves
the
closet
shelves
all
tidy
and
and
clean
sash
curtains
in
the
windows
i
was
to
get
my
first
dinner
alone
for
poor
little
robin
had
had
a
wretched
night
and
been
in
so
much
pain
during
the
day
that
we
had
finally
decided
to
send
for
the
doctor
he
was
expected
at
any
moment
and
mother
had
to
be
ready
to
receive
him
the
potatoes
were
bubbling
pleasantly
away
on
the
hottest
part
of
the
stove
the
steak
was
salted
and
peppered
on
the
gridiron
ready
for
broiling
and
i
had
just
run
in
to
the
to
take
a
last
survey
of
the
table
before
sitting
down
to
cut
up
the
oranges
when
there
sounded
a
on
the
and
looking
up
i
saw
anxious
face
peering
in
at
me
naturally
i
ran
to
the
basement
door
to
let
him
in
anything
the
matter
haze
i
asked
he
has
a
latchkey
and
it
seemed
odd
that
he
should
tap
at
the
window
elizabeth
he
answered
want
to
know
that
home
just
and
he
preceded
me
into
the
threw
his
cap
upon
a
chair
sat
despairingly
down
on
it
and
buried
his
head
in
his
arms
across
the
has
happened
hazard
i
asked
anxiously
haze
swallowed
hard
looked
up
and
then
let
his
head
drop
down
on
his
arm
again
answer
me
haze
i
urged
is
the
matter
you
dismissed
are
you
this
time
returned
haze
unsteadily
from
our
point
of
view
all
the
same
as
if
i
and
then
in
an
ashamed
and
broken
voice
the
poor
boy
started
in
to
tell
his
story
it
seems
that
he
was
sent
by
bridges
this
morning
to
collect
a
small
debt
for
the
firm
haze
got
the
money
without
any
trouble
and
started
at
a
clip
down
the
office
stairs
because
the
elevator
was
several
flights
up
and
he
wanted
to
break
the
record
so
to
speak
and
accomplish
his
errand
in
such
short
time
that
bridges
whose
special
hobby
is
promptitude
would
be
forced
to
notice
and
commend
him
when
he
reached
the
curb
there
was
no
car
in
sight
and
hazard
happened
to
remember
that
he
had
not
counted
his
money
of
course
he
knew
that
it
must
be
all
right
for
the
firm
he
was
dealing
with
is
perfectly
trustworthy
and
reputable
however
to
make
sure
haze
thrust
his
hand
into
his
coat
pocket
drew
out
the
little
wad
of
bills
and
proceeded
to
verify
were
two
tens
a
two
and
three
ones
in
all
dollars
which
was
the
correct
sum
haze
stood
with
the
money
in
his
hand
thinking
how
nice
it
would
be
to
have
that
amount
to
spend
on
christmas
till
presently
a
car
came
bowling
along
haze
thrust
the
bills
hurriedly
into
the
outside
pocket
of
his
overcoat
and
swung
on
there
was
a
old
gentleman
standing
on
the
back
platform
he
caught
haze
by
the
arm
and
steadied
him
blood
will
have
its
way
he
remarked
in
admiring
reproof
forty
years
ago
i
swung
aboard
the
cars
in
just
such
style
you
sir
all
right
says
haze
never
stopping
to
think
that
it
must
have
been
stage
coaches
the
old
gentleman
swung
aboard
weather
remarked
new
friend
presently
but
not
too
keen
i
see
you
are
like
myself
and
prefer
the
view
from
the
back
platform
here
to
the
stuffy
atmosphere
within
oh
the
poetry
of
a
great
city
he
observed
again
romance
here
as
fine
and
true
as
any
hid
away
amid
the
snowcapped
hills
and
sheltered
valleys
of
my
native
state
judging
from
your
physiognomy
my
boy
you
are
of
the
fibre
to
appreciate
all
that
the
brow
of
a
scholar
above
the
ardent
eyes
of
a
poet
you
sir
says
hazey
again
blushing
a
bit
and
thinking
i
a
doubt
what
a
nice
appreciative
old
gentleman
he
had
run
across
do
like
to
watch
the
city
and
listen
to
its
hum
like
wheels
within
a
wheel
if
you
can
keep
your
place
and
pace
all
right
concluded
the
old
gentleman
his
eyes
fixed
abstractedly
upon
the
guard
who
had
walked
the
length
of
the
car
and
was
fumbling
with
the
door
handle
it
is
what
one
might
and
then
much
to
the
surprise
of
hazard
he
hopped
lightly
to
the
step
swung
himself
off
the
car
with
a
really
amazing
agility
for
one
of
his
years
and
disappeared
among
the
throng
haze
was
still
staring
blankly
after
him
when
he
felt
a
touch
upon
his
shoulder
please
said
the
guard
haze
felt
in
his
overcoat
pocket
for
the
nickel
and
turned
pale
the
wad
of
bills
was
gone
he
had
been
robbed
the
worst
of
it
is
added
hazard
i
shall
have
to
make
good
out
of
my
salary
that
means
i
be
able
to
pay
another
cent
to
the
family
for
eight
weeks
elizabeth
and
planned
what
i
was
going
to
give
you
all
for
christmas
bridges
called
me
a
before
the
entire
office
i
can
stand
most
things
concluded
poor
hazey
with
an
angry
sort
of
gulp
not
an
of
course
i
comforted
him
as
well
as
i
could
and
told
him
i
would
break
the
matter
to
mother
but
oh
it
took
all
my
courage
i
can
tell
you
when
she
came
down
a
few
moments
later
and
so
after
her
interview
with
the
doctor
there
was
no
use
waiting
however
till
after
dinner
we
should
have
to
wash
the
dishes
then
and
she
would
want
to
return
to
robin
so
i
began
as
cheerfully
as
i
could
and
mother
listened
half
as
if
she
had
expected
it
could
ever
suppose
that
three
dollars
a
week
would
seem
so
much
she
said
at
last
we
have
any
christmas
spree
all
sorry
dears
but
i
do
not
dare
draw
anything
from
the
bank
there
is
only
left
we
may
need
it
all
somehow
in
the
back
of
my
brain
i
have
half
a
suspicion
what
mother
fears
we
may
need
that
money
for
but
i
am
not
going
to
ask
her
and
make
sure
i
the
courage
all
protested
ernie
who
had
come
down
to
the
kitchen
in
time
to
hear
last
words
christmas
spree
what
will
robin
think
there
said
mother
almost
harshly
be
helped
ernestine
get
the
blue
dish
for
the
potatoes
and
then
ring
the
gong
we
keep
miss
brown
so
dinner
was
served
but
though
miss
brown
was
really
very
nice
and
said
that
everything
was
and
she
thought
we
should
find
the
new
régime
a
real
improvement
on
the
old
i
could
not
feel
much
pleasure
in
her
praise
i
tell
you
something
asked
ernie
unexpectedly
as
she
set
a
dish
of
milk
for
rosebud
on
the
hearth
after
the
table
was
cleared
and
miss
brown
had
gone
upstairs
uncle
george
is
a
devil
there
said
mother
turning
in
the
doorway
with
tray
which
she
was
about
to
carry
to
the
nursery
wish
you
to
speak
that
way
it
is
not
right
uncle
george
has
been
a
good
friend
to
us
according
to
his
lights
and
in
this
instance
the
fault
is
entirely
with
hazard
he
was
foolish
and
careless
and
we
can
not
expect
an
exception
to
be
made
in
his
case
it
was
against
my
wishes
that
he
took
a
position
it
lies
with
himself
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
to
try
to
overcome
those
faults
of
character
which
prevent
his
being
the
comfort
and
support
to
me
that
i
have
a
right
to
poor
hazey
who
was
helping
dry
the
dishes
blushed
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
dropped
a
cup
and
smashed
it
oh
dear
i
do
feel
so
sorry
for
that
big
splash
is
a
tear
there
just
seem
to
be
any
roses
so
there
monday
december
all
last
night
the
wind
whistled
and
howled
about
the
house
this
morning
we
woke
to
a
snowstorm
of
almost
blizzard
proportions
and
oh
but
the
atmosphere
was
arctic
get
up
first
says
ernie
poking
her
little
pink
nose
above
the
do
nothing
of
the
sort
i
answered
thought
you
loved
me
elizabeth
wailed
ernestine
reproachfully
i
do
i
answered
and
hopped
heroically
forth
to
the
glacial
matting
ernie
followed
with
hysterical
giggles
i
can
tell
you
it
did
not
take
us
long
to
dress
fortunately
miss
brown
had
gone
to
spend
sunday
with
a
niece
in
flatbush
so
we
did
not
have
her
to
worry
about
mother
made
the
nursery
as
comfortable
as
possible
at
the
sacrifice
of
heavy
inroads
upon
our
precious
stock
of
coal
and
there
haze
ernie
robin
and
i
passed
the
morning
for
haze
was
taken
ill
sunday
night
with
a
sharp
attack
of
laryngitis
and
was
still
unfit
for
the
office
and
we
did
not
think
it
wise
for
ernie
to
attempt
to
make
her
way
to
school
through
the
snowdrifts
but
though
it
is
not
often
now
that
we
have
the
chance
of
a
day
together
it
was
not
especially
jolly
poor
hazey
squatted
on
the
register
very
hoarse
and
gloomy
pegging
away
at
his
eternal
cæsar
i
darned
stockings
and
understood
just
how
it
was
that
rose
had
used
to
be
cross
on
a
stormy
monday
while
ernie
hid
in
a
corner
behind
a
series
of
screens
that
she
had
contrived
sang
carols
and
asked
ridiculous
riddles
busy
as
she
declared
upon
as
for
robin
he
sat
in
his
shabby
little
grey
flannel
propped
up
with
pillows
in
the
middle
of
big
bed
talking
about
santa
claus
and
the
things
he
wanted
for
been
good
for
three
weeks
he
boasted
vaingloriously
taken
my
oil
i
elizabeth
and
finished
the
first
reader
and
learned
to
spell
hope
old
santa
knows
about
it
i
want
a
lot
things
you
write
a
letter
and
tell
him
what
you
want
suggested
ernie
whereat
hazard
scowled
at
her
over
his
cæsar
and
i
shook
my
head
warningly
but
it
was
already
too
late
robin
caught
gleefully
at
the
suggestion
will
he
piped
me
some
paper
and
a
pencil
elizabeth
hurry
up
now
honey
for
bobsie
dearly
loves
to
write
letters
and
the
fact
that
no
one
can
read
them
but
himself
does
not
dampen
his
enthusiasm
in
the
least
is
the
difference
sang
out
ernie
blithely
while
i
searched
desk
for
a
of
note
paper
a
horse
and
an
egg
no
difference
between
you
and
a
donkey
growled
hazard
i
like
that
retorted
ernestine
while
robin
after
a
vigorous
suck
at
the
stump
of
pencil
i
had
handed
him
began
unctuously
upon
his
letter
santa
he
muttered
want
the
mowgli
corrected
ernie
a
horse
just
like
continued
robin
with
a
flourish
not
a
little
white
cuddly
flannel
rabbit
with
pink
eyes
suggested
ernestine
could
take
that
to
bed
with
you
you
know
robin
and
the
horse
would
have
to
sleep
in
a
stall
in
the
closet
which
be
nearly
so
convenient
little
white
flannel
rabbit
with
pink
corrected
robin
obligingly
a
steamboat
what
can
whistle
and
a
box
of
building
blocks
but
here
haze
slammed
to
his
book
up
bobs
he
commanded
roughly
the
good
there
any
santa
claus
and
you
might
just
as
well
know
it
now
but
there
he
stopped
for
robin
was
staring
at
him
with
such
round
frightened
eyes
that
ernie
and
i
cried
out
together
hazard
how
can
you
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
haze
opened
his
book
again
care
he
muttered
any
use
in
his
running
on
like
that
he
going
to
get
anything
we
all
know
it
but
bobsie
cried
will
too
taken
my
oil
i
tell
you
and
ernie
running
to
his
side
flung
her
arms
protectingly
about
him
course
you
have
honey
she
crooned
of
course
get
some
presents
hazard
is
only
teasing
the
idea
of
there
not
being
any
santa
claus
who
gave
you
your
things
last
year
like
to
know
chin
was
beginning
to
quiver
and
two
great
teardrops
blinked
on
the
ends
of
his
long
lashes
he
held
his
arms
tight
about
neck
and
cuddled
up
against
her
side
haze
looked
at
them
a
moment
threw
his
book
aside
and
strode
from
the
room
i
following
i
began
as
soon
as
the
door
had
shut
upon
us
was
cruel
how
could
you
do
such
a
thing
bother
answered
haze
gruffly
intend
to
say
it
that
way
going
to
get
anything
i
bear
to
have
him
go
on
like
that
and
know
it
was
all
my
fault
and
let
me
alone
elizabeth
and
shaking
my
hand
from
his
arm
he
turned
and
bolted
upstairs
where
i
heard
the
workshop
door
slam
to
behind
him
naturally
if
the
rest
of
the
house
is
cold
you
can
imagine
what
it
must
be
in
the
workshop
i
was
very
much
afraid
that
hazard
would
add
to
his
sore
throat
but
i
knew
it
would
do
no
good
to
speak
to
him
just
then
so
i
returned
to
the
nursery
where
ernie
was
still
sitting
on
the
side
of
the
bed
her
arms
close
about
robin
whispering
to
him
in
the
most
seductive
of
tones
he
looked
just
like
the
pictures
bobsie
she
was
saying
was
in
front
of
that
we
met
and
i
think
he
must
have
been
looking
about
at
the
toys
i
was
very
much
surprised
of
course
but
i
went
right
up
to
him
and
said
do
you
do
santa
claus
robin
you
ernie
cried
robin
with
shining
eyes
what
did
he
say
tell
you
that
returned
ernie
mysteriously
it
is
a
secret
but
you
worry
honey
is
going
to
be
all
here
i
thought
it
time
to
interfere
for
though
hazard
had
been
hasty
and
even
unkind
in
the
way
he
spoke
still
we
all
knew
that
robin
was
not
going
to
get
anything
for
christmas
what
was
the
use
of
comforting
him
with
false
hopes
that
could
only
lead
to
a
still
more
bitter
disappointment
down
and
set
the
table
ernie
i
said
a
little
dryly
time
for
robin
to
have
his
reading
lesson
bobsie
looked
at
me
half
shyly
under
his
dark
lashes
have
a
secret
he
said
and
gave
ernie
a
long
kiss
before
he
let
her
go
after
luncheon
while
we
were
washing
the
dishes
i
asked
ernestine
what
she
meant
by
talking
to
robin
so
is
no
good
in
deceiving
him
i
said
course
hazard
did
not
set
about
it
in
the
right
way
but
sooner
or
later
he
will
have
to
be
told
he
going
to
get
anything
you
heard
what
mother
ernie
looked
at
me
in
blank
amazement
elizabeth
she
cried
i
returned
are
nearly
thirteen
years
old
do
you
believe
in
santa
claus
too
ernie
laughed
and
flapped
her
dish
towel
course
i
do
she
answered
my
own
fashion
you
and
hazard
are
too
silly
mother
mean
i
suppose
that
she
was
going
to
take
away
all
the
presents
that
come
to
the
house
for
robin
and
burn
them
she
only
meant
that
we
spend
any
money
to
prevent
aunt
adelaide
giving
him
something
as
she
always
does
like
to
know
and
georgie
and
geof
here
ernie
began
to
to
the
cupboard
with
a
pile
of
plates
elizabeth
she
chortled
says
i
can
help
him
choose
robin
will
be
simply
he
has
never
had
anything
so
stunning
in
all
his
life
but
there
rattled
the
plates
perilously
down
on
the
cupboard
shelf
a
secret
i
promised
i
breathe
a
word
and
i
know
another
that
miss
brown
told
me
and
with
burroughs
hazard
is
a
grumpy
goose
why
he
think
of
something
to
give
bobsie
the
way
doing
cost
you
know
of
being
so
huffy
and
remorseful
about
a
past
that
be
helped
now
that
exactly
like
ernie
christmas
is
her
birthday
and
she
seems
to
have
the
very
spirit
in
her
veins
if
we
were
wrecked
upon
a
desert
island
i
believe
she
would
still
find
some
appropriate
way
to
celebrate
is
what
you
were
busy
about
behind
your
screen
i
cried
course
says
ernie
did
you
think
you
must
make
something
too
elizabeth
and
i
know
mother
will
and
the
letter
was
just
a
blind
to
get
robin
to
believe
he
wanted
the
things
we
can
afford
to
give
him
i
thought
you
and
hazard
would
even
if
we
are
poor
so
long
as
we
love
one
another
and
keep
jolly
the
odds
i
answered
are
a
darling
any
so
then
we
sought
an
interview
with
hazard
to
explain
how
matters
stood
right
he
answered
none
too
enthusiastic
just
at
first
try
different
with
you
girls
i
make
anything
you
see
out
of
sawdust
and
gold
paper
and
everything
saved
must
go
for
car
fare
and
expenses
these
next
few
weeks
honestly
i
a
cent
to
call
my
own
except
my
lucky
penny
of
the
year
lincoln
was
shot
and
perhaps
lost
he
searched
his
pockets
it
it
over
says
ernie
know
think
the
best
luck
you
can
possibly
have
just
now
is
to
buy
a
nice
christmas
present
for
robin
do
your
shopping
this
year
hazey
and
promise
to
get
something
bobs
will
really
like
too
cheer
up
children
no
santa
claus
indeed
ashamed
of
friday
december
christmas
has
come
and
gone
and
in
spite
of
our
gloomy
expectations
we
have
had
the
jolliest
time
you
would
hardly
believe
it
oh
were
plenty
of
roses
the
first
nice
thing
that
happened
was
on
tuesday
morning
when
mother
received
a
letter
from
miss
brown
stating
that
she
had
been
asked
to
stay
over
the
holidays
with
her
niece
in
flatbush
hurrah
carolled
ernie
the
glad
tidings
exultantly
sing
jerusalem
triumphs
messiah
is
king
she
did
not
mean
anything
the
least
irreligious
it
was
simply
a
spontaneous
outburst
of
joy
and
at
the
same
instant
a
mad
enthusiasm
seemed
to
seize
hold
of
us
all
finish
the
breakfast
dishes
at
once
elizabeth
said
mother
have
some
sewing
upstairs
that
i
attend
there
is
something
i
must
finish
too
answered
i
considerate
of
miss
niece
just
think
our
christmas
dinner
alone
you
you
are
spend
my
shouted
hazard
from
the
hall
above
understand
ernie
want
it
to
far
as
yes
answered
ernie
a
grand
idea
you
worry
hazard
geof
and
i
are
going
shopping
this
afternoon
after
and
so
they
did
and
so
did
mother
and
so
did
i
it
was
really
amusing
nobody
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
tell
what
had
been
bought
except
that
was
very
cheap
dear
worry
then
in
the
evening
ernie
and
i
made
molasses
candy
because
it
is
less
expensive
than
fudge
and
we
had
determined
to
pull
it
and
twist
it
into
original
shapes
something
individual
for
each
one
for
robin
we
made
a
little
yellow
bird
i
must
confess
it
looked
more
like
a
chicken
than
anything
else
a
boy
with
a
big
hat
and
a
crooked
nose
and
a
pig
with
a
curly
tail
candy
we
put
peanuts
in
and
did
not
pull
because
he
prefers
it
that
way
we
tied
into
a
variety
of
charming
and
ernie
made
me
a
mandolin
and
geof
a
hockey
stick
while
i
made
ernie
a
santa
claus
he
was
a
little
wobbly
in
the
legs
to
be
sure
but
any
one
could
recognise
him
from
his
pack
in
the
middle
of
it
all
burroughs
came
over
full
of
her
own
plans
do
hope
you
say
no
graham
she
pleaded
had
any
christmas
ages
it
seems
that
she
wished
to
give
a
party
for
robin
will
have
it
wednesday
night
christmas
eve
she
explained
it
interfere
with
your
family
celebration
in
the
least
may
i
it
would
be
lovely
we
all
answered
with
enthusiasm
and
burroughs
flushed
a
beautiful
rose
colour
and
for
a
moment
the
quick
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
you
so
much
she
answered
settled
you
see
francis
and
i
used
to
have
such
good
times
and
just
the
last
year
i
got
him
a
magic
lantern
it
is
really
a
very
nice
one
and
there
are
some
charming
slides
night
before
is
the
set
francis
liked
best
the
pictures
of
the
reindeer
i
thought
we
might
give
it
for
robin
and
perhaps
you
will
lend
your
back
parlour
for
the
occasion
we
can
begin
early
seven
i
wonder
if
hazard
will
consent
to
act
as
manager
better
choose
geof
warned
ernie
cleverer
at
that
sort
of
thing
and
sure
like
to
so
the
matter
was
arranged
the
following
afternoon
the
intense
excitement
of
robin
burroughs
geof
and
ernie
shut
themselves
up
in
the
back
parlour
from
whence
began
to
issue
the
sound
of
much
laughter
and
hammering
despite
his
impatience
it
was
not
till
quarter
to
seven
that
the
doors
were
finally
thrown
open
and
robin
was
carried
down
how
charming
everything
looked
to
be
sure
long
loops
of
were
festooned
about
the
chandelier
and
along
the
a
great
artificial
christmas
bell
hung
in
the
doorway
from
either
side
of
which
dropped
gay
streamers
of
strung
with
that
jingled
and
sang
in
the
merriest
fashion
at
the
touch
of
a
passing
hand
in
the
window
were
holly
wreaths
and
back
of
the
madonna
over
the
were
two
more
great
branches
of
holly
with
the
biggest
brightest
berries
i
have
ever
seen
a
red
christmas
candle
burned
upon
the
piano
the
old
lounge
covered
with
a
tiger
rug
lent
by
burroughs
had
been
pushed
out
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
a
series
of
arranged
about
it
between
the
folding
doors
the
magic
sheet
was
hung
and
behind
it
could
be
heard
the
voices
of
geof
and
ernie
in
animated
discussion
presently
the
guests
began
to
arrive
and
his
nurse
john
who
had
been
looked
up
especially
for
the
occasion
because
as
bobs
persuasively
explained
would
be
pretty
odd
for
a
boy
to
give
a
party
and
not
ask
his
own
old
endicott
who
is
aunt
and
rosebud
very
gay
and
debonair
in
a
becoming
red
ribbon
bow
audience
is
ready
sang
out
robin
from
his
lair
on
the
tiger
skin
makes
the
party
so
late
like
to
know
late
at
all
returned
burroughs
from
behind
the
curtain
idea
we
said
seven
and
it
is
only
quarter
after
you
are
early
all
however
in
another
moment
geof
appeared
to
turn
down
the
lights
with
a
deep
expectant
sigh
from
robin
georgie
and
john
the
party
had
begun
the
pictures
were
certainly
charming
and
geoffrey
managed
the
slides
without
a
hitch
first
came
night
before
claus
starting
out
on
his
journey
with
a
sleigh
overladen
with
toys
how
the
reindeer
looked
to
be
sure
and
how
impatient
to
be
off
can
go
i
bet
you
shouted
georgie
santa
takes
up
the
next
followed
a
scene
among
the
a
great
round
moon
overhead
and
santa
claus
already
disappearing
down
the
chimney
can
be
your
house
john
says
robin
magnanimously
going
to
leave
that
tin
trumpet
i
want
do
i
answered
john
rather
have
a
real
but
already
the
scene
had
shifted
santa
claus
upon
the
hearthrug
was
filling
stockings
with
a
roguish
glance
at
three
little
heads
buried
among
the
pillows
of
a
great
bed
how
the
children
laughed
and
applauded
next
came
the
stories
of
puss
in
and
my
which
were
an
almost
equal
success
and
finally
when
the
last
slide
was
exhausted
the
lights
were
turned
up
and
what
georgie
called
real
was
brought
in
this
consisted
of
ice
cream
served
in
pretty
coloured
forms
of
fruits
and
flowers
dishes
of
and
a
mild
brew
of
cocoa
the
favours
were
mechanical
toys
such
as
are
sold
in
quantities
along
broadway
and
street
at
this
season
of
the
year
amusing
or
interesting
for
each
one
georgie
had
a
monkey
that
ran
up
a
stick
robin
a
small
toy
balloon
in
the
shape
of
a
pink
rubber
pig
that
squealed
shrilly
when
blown
up
geof
a
rooster
that
could
flap
its
wings
and
crow
and
ernie
a
little
old
woman
with
a
rake
and
a
who
after
being
properly
wound
up
would
start
conscientiously
forth
to
sprinkle
her
garden
only
to
trip
at
the
first
obstruction
she
met
and
lie
kicking
her
heels
frantically
on
the
carpet
it
has
been
a
party
sighed
robin
at
last
his
arms
tight
about
neck
as
he
kissed
her
a
sticky
but
affectionate
you
much
and
merry
christmas
dear
bless
you
darling
boy
returned
burroughs
you
lie
awake
thinking
about
it
and
will
come
all
the
so
with
greetings
and
many
protestations
of
having
passed
a
most
delightful
evening
the
guests
departed
robin
was
hustled
upstairs
to
bed
by
mother
while
ernie
haze
and
i
proceeded
to
collect
the
various
christmas
gifts
that
had
arrived
preparatory
to
filling
his
stocking
really
there
was
so
much
a
delightful
comforter
for
his
cot
from
aunt
adelaide
a
set
of
from
georgie
the
from
burroughs
and
a
regiment
of
with
artillery
and
mounted
officers
that
had
come
in
the
mail
from
miss
brown
next
we
brought
out
the
home
things
gay
little
that
mother
had
made
from
her
old
cashmere
shawl
with
collar
and
cuffs
a
pair
of
crocheted
slippers
to
match
this
was
my
gift
a
little
white
flannel
rabbit
with
pink
beads
for
eyes
and
a
fluff
of
a
tail
from
ernie
and
a
really
amazing
menagerie
of
some
hundred
and
fifty
animals
elephants
giraffes
lions
tigers
leopards
monkeys
and
all
she
had
traced
the
pictures
from
old
magazines
transferred
the
outline
to
heavy
paper
cut
the
figures
out
and
coloured
them
wonderful
ernie
i
cried
my
present
asked
haze
looking
worried
coming
says
ernie
and
running
from
the
room
she
returned
a
moment
later
do
you
think
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
a
live
clam
if
you
please
neatly
housed
in
the
little
glass
globe
that
hazard
used
to
keep
in
some
years
ago
smoke
muttered
haze
not
knowing
whether
to
be
most
disappointed
or
amused
it
for
pet
to
be
sure
answered
ernie
nonchalantly
bought
it
of
murray
the
fishman
and
though
he
said
he
did
not
usually
sell
clams
by
the
piece
when
he
did
they
cost
just
one
cent
so
call
it
abraham
lincoln
in
memory
of
your
lucky
penny
bobsie
will
love
it
it
can
snap
at
a
straw
if
you
try
to
tickle
it
and
hang
on
like
a
bulldog
how
did
you
ever
come
to
think
of
it
ernie
i
asked
answered
ernie
succinctly
had
the
other
morning
for
breakfast
and
then
too
been
studying
bivalves
in
school
this
term
and
they
are
really
very
interesting
so
the
stocking
was
filled
with
an
orange
an
apple
the
figures
pig
boy
left
over
from
the
party
my
slippers
and
the
white
flannel
rabbit
whose
pink
silesia
ears
poked
alluringly
out
at
the
top
mother
and
i
stole
on
tiptoe
into
the
nursery
to
play
the
part
of
santa
claus
by
light
of
a
shaded
candle
we
dropped
the
down
quilt
softly
over
crib
and
stood
for
a
moment
watching
our
baby
who
quite
worn
out
with
the
excitement
slept
feverishly
a
bright
flush
upon
his
cheek
his
little
breast
rising
and
falling
in
answer
to
his
hurried
breathing
hope
it
has
not
been
too
much
for
him
said
mother
in
a
low
voice
hope
not
i
answered
but
we
might
have
spared
ourselves
anxiety
robin
slept
quietly
through
the
night
and
till
seven
christmas
morning
when
he
woke
as
fresh
and
blithe
as
a
lark
and
how
delighted
he
was
with
all
his
things
he
positively
shouted
with
joy
over
the
paper
menagerie
and
tin
soldiers
and
insisted
upon
being
put
into
his
new
on
the
spot
with
many
sarcastic
side
remarks
about
what
said
there
was
no
santa
claus
but
the
present
that
pleased
him
most
of
all
lincoln
is
what
i
wanted
more
than
in
the
he
remarked
with
a
fondly
doting
glance
at
his
new
pet
i
think
of
it
in
time
to
say
so
now
when
rosebud
runs
away
and
leaves
me
i
need
never
be
lonely
again
though
the
rest
of
us
did
not
fare
as
royally
as
robin
there
was
some
trifle
for
each
one
had
seen
to
that
had
just
fifty
cents
to
spend
on
the
entire
family
she
explained
you
think
i
managed
well
there
were
also
a
number
of
pretty
gifts
from
burroughs
the
score
of
from
meta
for
me
and
a
really
portentous
jackknife
with
three
blades
and
a
corkscrew
attachment
from
geof
for
ernie
jolly
she
cried
hopping
about
on
her
little
pink
toes
need
never
borrow
again
and
i
can
pull
all
oil
corks
after
breakfast
came
church
haze
volunteered
to
stay
with
bobsie
so
that
mother
ernie
and
i
might
go
but
just
as
we
were
leaving
the
house
whom
should
we
meet
on
the
front
stoop
but
geoffrey
bearing
his
present
for
robin
really
handsome
cage
in
which
crouched
a
pair
of
tiny
white
mice
darlings
chortled
ernie
leave
i
so
she
deserted
mother
and
me
and
followed
geof
to
the
nursery
and
when
we
returned
from
service
some
two
hours
later
the
three
enthusiasts
were
still
gloating
elizabeth
exulted
ernie
let
out
of
the
cage
and
they
are
quite
tame
going
to
call
them
open
o
buds
o
open
and
sweet
fern
remarked
robin
in
sentimental
accents
helped
me
think
of
those
names
they
pretty
aunt
peggy
says
geof
a
wheel
to
the
cage
so
they
can
get
plenty
of
exercise
and
the
man
i
bought
of
told
me
we
might
expect
a
family
about
every
three
me
murmured
mother
in
some
dismay
wish
he
been
quite
so
lavish
in
his
promises
but
i
must
go
down
to
attend
to
dinner
now
be
careful
of
rosebud
robin
she
would
like
your
mice
only
too
well
i
the
afternoon
passed
quietly
ernie
and
haze
carrying
our
usual
christmas
package
to
the
little
kerns
whose
mother
used
to
wash
for
us
once
on
a
time
she
is
an
invalid
now
and
the
family
are
even
poorer
than
we
poor
lambs
whatever
we
may
have
to
go
without
ourselves
we
afford
to
economise
on
luella
joseph
and
angeline
remarked
ernie
some
two
or
three
weeks
ago
and
immediately
she
and
robin
set
to
work
patching
up
their
dilapidated
toys
and
picture
books
generously
casting
aside
those
that
were
shabby
clipping
stitching
and
gluing
till
kern
in
the
nursery
cupboard
presented
a
very
attractive
appearance
indeed
mother
added
oranges
a
jar
of
beef
extract
and
half
a
pound
of
tea
do
hope
they
will
like
their
things
as
well
as
we
like
ours
sighed
robin
responsibly
stuffing
his
molasses
candy
pig
and
the
last
of
the
sugar
plums
into
overcoat
pocket
you
think
they
will
mother
dear
see
why
they
should
not
mother
answered
and
then
she
took
robin
in
her
lap
in
the
big
rocker
and
read
him
the
christmas
story
from
matthew
explaining
about
the
wise
men
and
the
gifts
they
brought
after
which
she
lowered
the
nursery
shades
and
left
him
to
take
a
nap
she
explained
want
our
boy
to
be
fresh
and
rested
for
this
i
asked
surprises
a
little
one
returned
mother
modestly
yet
it
turned
out
to
be
the
most
charming
of
all
you
would
never
guess
a
tiny
toy
christmas
tree
not
more
than
a
foot
and
a
half
high
lighted
with
twelve
little
candles
and
gay
with
popcorn
wreaths
gilded
walnuts
and
silver
tinsel
found
it
on
the
bowery
explained
mother
half
guiltily
a
small
german
shop
it
was
very
cheap
elizabeth
so
worry
how
eyes
shone
as
he
was
carried
into
the
back
parlour
where
the
little
tree
stood
sparkling
on
a
table
drawn
up
beside
the
couch
are
presents
on
it
too
says
mother
and
so
there
were
for
from
every
branch
and
twig
dangled
a
series
of
coloured
pasteboard
discs
lettered
in
white
ink
and
reading
thus
pearl
ring
with
much
love
to
elizabeth
from
pair
of
skates
for
dear
ernie
from
of
volumes
good
type
hazard
from
canary
in
a
gold
cage
for
robin
from
ermine
muff
and
stole
for
elizabeth
from
mother
etc
all
the
dear
beautiful
dream
gifts
that
mother
would
have
given
to
her
children
if
only
she
had
been
able
the
candles
on
the
little
tree
began
to
blink
and
twinkle
like
living
stars
the
way
lights
will
when
looked
at
through
happy
tears
even
robin
understood
love
my
autoharp
better
than
anything
in
the
world
he
declared
dangling
the
small
pasteboard
disc
by
its
red
cord
even
better
than
abraham
lincoln
he
cried
you
mother
dear
that
echoed
haze
as
enthusiastically
as
if
he
expected
to
sit
down
to
the
first
volume
next
minute
hope
i
have
not
only
succeeded
in
making
you
dissatisfied
my
poor
lambs
said
mother
a
little
anxiously
cried
ernie
striking
out
in
fine
skating
style
for
the
piano
you
think
a
brood
of
ungrateful
brutes
hatched
into
the
mum
have
some
carols
now
i
want
to
shout
and
so
we
did
hazard
quite
off
the
tune
as
usual
robin
piping
away
in
his
gay
little
treble
ernie
and
i
trying
our
best
to
keep
the
others
up
to
time
it
was
all
very
jolly
and
as
i
said
when
i
first
sat
down
to
write
we
simply
could
not
have
passed
a
lovelier
christmas
no
matter
how
much
money
we
might
have
spent
do
you
think
we
could
thursday
january
we
sat
up
last
night
to
watch
the
new
year
in
geof
ernie
and
i
the
workshop
was
cold
and
we
missed
the
do
not
believe
declared
ernie
dejectedly
resolutions
do
a
bit
of
good
i
have
made
the
same
four
regularly
for
the
last
two
years
written
them
out
in
red
ink
on
a
slip
of
paper
and
kept
them
in
my
bible
nobody
seems
to
find
me
any
nicer
they
were
not
the
right
kind
hazarded
geof
good
deal
depends
upon
what
one
resolves
i
idea
flashed
ernie
guess
you
did
not
make
any
better
my
prayers
wash
my
teeth
love
god
and
the
boarders
so
there
general
criticised
haze
ought
to
do
those
things
whether
you
resolve
them
or
not
it
be
especially
annoying
even
if
you
it
is
my
opinion
that
no
man
is
competent
to
make
his
own
resolutions
he
know
where
he
most
needs
reform
if
family
made
them
for
one
now
and
one
was
pledged
in
right
agreed
geof
try
it
i
resolve
old
chap
that
you
hold
up
your
head
when
you
walk
and
quit
peering
through
your
glasses
like
a
reuben
at
a
county
take
only
one
at
dinner
seconded
ernie
brush
your
coat
every
morning
if
one
handsome
one
can
at
least
be
neat
i
cried
see
myself
hanged
retorted
hazard
angrily
i
resolve
one
of
those
things
they
are
childish
as
well
as
insulting
if
this
meeting
is
going
to
degenerate
into
a
travesty
i
and
he
stalked
haughtily
from
the
room
chap
chuckled
geof
did
he
get
mad
at
must
be
very
conceited
if
he
stand
a
little
friendly
criticism
agreed
ernie
we
take
elizabeth
next
i
amended
hastily
have
just
thought
of
such
a
good
one
for
you
ernie
dear
wear
stockings
with
ladders
running
up
the
leg
it
ladylike
and
you
have
plenty
of
time
to
darn
stop
worrying
about
the
shape
of
your
nose
added
geof
change
it
you
worry
snapped
ernie
untruthfully
are
a
pig
geoffrey
graham
and
i
resolve
that
you
learn
to
dance
so
there
do
it
said
geof
with
whom
dancing
is
still
a
sore
subject
if
you
are
going
to
call
names
i
think
it
is
about
time
for
me
to
go
consented
ernie
readily
returned
geof
and
he
picked
up
his
cap
and
left
me
i
remarked
as
the
first
horn
sounded
and
the
bells
began
to
chime
their
welcome
to
the
new
year
made
everybody
so
cross
i
am
the
only
person
who
did
not
get
are
the
only
person
who
did
not
have
a
resolution
made
for
you
replied
ernie
is
one
you
can
just
see
how
you
like
it
stop
being
so
everlastingly
ready
to
preach
elizabeth
i
know
you
call
it
but
it
bores
ernie
i
gasped
you
really
mean
that
perhaps
not
entirely
admitted
ernie
with
a
swift
return
to
normal
lovableness
there
is
some
truth
in
it
dear
one
likes
to
be
blue
at
times
and
feel
that
it
noticed
come
along
to
bed
sorry
i
let
geof
go
without
saying
new
year
and
sorry
we
forgot
to
eat
the
italian
chestnuts
he
brought
after
all
the
old
way
of
making
resolutions
was
i
agreed
pleasanter
by
far
then
we
kissed
one
another
and
laughed
and
crept
down
the
attic
stairs
hand
in
hand
it
often
that
ernie
and
i
come
near
a
quarrel
and
the
new
year
was
in
i
wonder
what
it
will
bring
us
oh
i
do
want
to
be
good
apart
of
course
stronger
and
more
contented
and
happy
in
our
lot
monday
january
ernie
wore
her
new
dress
to
school
this
morning
she
has
been
working
hard
on
it
ever
since
christmas
time
and
the
result
is
really
very
creditable
girls
will
never
believe
i
made
it
myself
elizabeth
she
remarked
standing
proudly
before
the
mirror
while
i
buttoned
her
up
the
back
actually
and
look
at
these
could
anything
be
more
stylish
you
think
clever
honey
now
you
indeed
spirits
rose
to
such
bubbling
point
with
the
openly
expressed
admiration
of
the
girls
and
her
own
inward
conviction
of
merit
she
found
it
impossible
to
keep
them
corked
up
during
school
hours
and
so
got
into
trouble
poor
child
under
the
circumstances
it
is
doubly
hard
for
ever
since
september
when
a
board
as
ernie
persists
in
calling
him
was
so
impressed
with
the
intelligent
answers
he
obtained
to
his
questions
in
the
sixth
grammar
grade
of
school
no
that
he
was
moved
to
offer
five
worth
of
books
to
be
awarded
as
a
prize
at
the
end
of
the
term
to
the
pupil
whose
general
average
in
attendance
conduct
and
scholarship
should
be
highest
her
record
has
been
impeccable
simply
must
come
out
ahead
she
has
declared
over
and
over
again
is
too
good
a
chance
to
miss
five
worth
of
books
elizabeth
think
of
it
and
if
i
should
get
choose
the
kind
that
will
be
appropriate
to
every
age
and
gender
and
then
put
away
and
give
them
as
birthday
presents
to
the
family
during
the
year
that
a
scheme
so
spurred
on
by
this
proud
ambition
ernie
has
done
wonderfully
succeeding
in
subduing
her
mercurial
temperament
to
such
a
degree
that
is
not
a
betther
in
all
the
school
than
me
me
hated
rival
lulu
jennings
as
she
was
moved
to
confess
last
saturday
night
this
aforesaid
rival
is
a
according
to
ernie
and
her
chum
mary
hobart
she
has
shifty
little
eyes
a
thin
blond
pigtail
and
to
her
legs
at
also
she
smells
of
cheap
perfume
yet
these
imperfections
might
be
forgiven
her
if
only
she
were
what
the
girls
call
seen
her
myself
says
downright
mary
an
open
geography
hid
under
a
handkerchief
in
her
lap
during
recitation
she
tattles
too
and
i
believe
copy
off
her
own
grandmother
if
only
she
got
the
naturally
such
sins
are
not
easily
forgiven
and
there
is
a
decided
opinion
among
the
girls
that
at
all
hazards
lulu
jennings
must
be
prevented
from
winning
the
prize
feeling
runs
high
on
the
subject
smarter
than
all
the
rest
of
us
put
together
in
some
ways
they
admit
can
never
foresee
what
trick
she
is
going
to
play
next
but
you
are
clever
too
ernie
in
a
way
we
like
better
so
keep
up
the
good
fight
right
promised
ernie
with
a
weary
little
sigh
mind
the
studying
so
much
but
i
must
confess
tired
of
being
a
plaster
saint
and
alas
which
was
composition
day
the
poor
little
plaster
saint
fell
it
happened
in
this
wise
the
subject
assigned
the
sixth
grade
was
benjamin
franklin
ernie
who
takes
naturally
to
writing
finished
her
essay
as
usual
before
any
of
the
other
girls
and
then
just
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
and
as
an
outlet
i
suppose
to
the
general
ebullition
of
vivacity
caused
by
her
new
frock
she
started
in
to
write
a
second
theme
in
verse
this
time
making
it
as
nonsensical
and
ridiculous
as
ever
she
could
as
soon
as
finished
she
passed
the
lines
to
mary
hobart
her
seatmate
who
began
to
read
and
giggle
at
the
same
moment
finally
she
was
so
overcome
by
mirth
that
she
was
obliged
to
put
her
head
into
her
desk
and
pretend
to
look
for
a
slate
pencil
lulu
jennings
who
sits
directly
across
the
aisle
from
mary
observed
these
demonstrations
the
matter
she
whispered
and
mary
thoughtlessly
passed
her
effusion
i
suppose
to
prove
to
the
enemy
how
clever
her
chum
really
was
lulu
cast
one
quick
glance
down
the
lines
then
taking
up
a
pencil
she
scrawled
the
query
along
the
margin
you
ask
to
read
it
aloud
and
handed
the
paper
back
to
ernie
will
if
you
like
returned
ernie
with
a
chuckle
supposing
of
course
that
the
suggestion
was
only
part
of
the
fun
right
i
dare
you
to
whispered
lulu
quick
as
a
flash
ernie
was
out
of
her
seat
she
has
never
been
known
to
take
a
dare
yet
and
lulu
counted
upon
this
weakness
we
feel
sure
i
read
my
composition
miss
horton
asked
ernie
there
was
nothing
unusual
in
the
request
since
any
girl
who
considers
her
theme
is
accorded
this
privilege
miss
horton
looked
up
from
the
exercises
she
was
correcting
if
you
think
it
will
interest
us
ernestine
she
said
mary
hobart
pulled
at
skirt
shook
her
head
and
motioned
imperiously
to
the
first
composition
which
still
lay
upon
the
desk
but
little
eyes
flashed
the
mean
message
knew
you
would
not
dare
and
without
a
hesitation
ernie
in
a
clear
serious
voice
began
to
read
benjamin
franklin
benjamin
franklin
was
when
a
boy
his
delight
and
his
joy
he
would
chase
after
lightning
wherever
he
spied
it
because
he
declared
that
he
wanted
to
ride
it
his
hair
was
quite
straight
but
his
nose
he
could
curl
and
so
people
thought
him
dear
little
girl
there
was
a
general
shout
from
the
class
while
miss
horton
rapped
sharply
on
the
desk
with
her
ruler
she
commanded
with
your
composition
and
ernie
with
a
rosy
and
rather
abashed
countenance
was
about
to
begin
the
second
stanza
when
the
door
opened
and
miss
the
principal
entered
the
room
miss
is
a
very
imposing
person
and
endowed
with
a
rather
high
temper
all
the
girls
are
afraid
of
her
she
stood
for
a
moment
looking
majestically
about
was
the
cause
of
the
outburst
of
disorder
i
heard
just
now
she
finally
asked
miss
horton
graham
is
reading
her
composition
on
benjamin
franklin
answered
miss
horton
really
anxious
to
shield
ernie
it
would
seem
was
something
in
it
that
struck
the
girls
as
i
should
judge
answered
miss
might
be
well
for
me
to
hear
the
rest
of
the
composition
myself
you
may
proceed
poor
ernie
her
knees
were
literally
clapping
together
with
horror
beneath
the
elegant
of
her
new
plaid
skirt
the
thought
of
her
cherished
record
assailed
her
she
turned
a
piteous
sickly
smile
upon
miss
who
met
it
with
a
glance
of
adamant
evidently
no
quarter
was
to
be
expected
from
that
direction
so
steadying
her
voice
as
well
as
she
could
ernie
began
to
read
again
this
time
you
might
have
heard
a
pin
drop
father
a
terrible
man
kept
in
the
closet
a
worn
rattan
when
ben
or
his
brothers
did
what
was
wrong
their
father
would
chant
them
this
horrible
song
run
to
my
closet
as
quick
as
you
can
and
bring
me
my
tan
and
with
it
you
until
with
your
eyeses
you
crieses
ernie
gasped
for
breath
that
all
asked
the
inexorable
miss
answered
ernie
plaintively
and
spurred
on
by
the
recklessness
of
despair
she
began
the
last
stanza
so
ben
and
his
brothers
they
grew
very
good
they
never
stole
nothing
not
even
their
food
but
lived
upon
pickles
and
peanuts
and
paint
and
when
asked
you
hungry
replied
we
but
take
if
give
it
a
wee
bite
of
soap
and
now
all
dead
and
in
heaven
i
hope
with
a
final
hysterical
giggle
ernie
dropped
back
into
her
seat
miss
stood
looking
at
her
possessed
you
she
asked
at
last
write
such
a
composition
as
that
have
you
no
respect
for
your
teacher
have
you
no
respect
for
your
school
have
you
no
respect
for
miss
horton
you
may
mark
ernestine
a
failure
in
her
conduct
and
her
english
too
she
will
remain
after
school
and
rewrite
her
composition
along
lines
the
class
may
now
proceed
with
its
and
miss
swept
from
the
room
well
ernie
had
had
her
little
joke
poor
child
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
blink
back
the
mortified
tears
as
she
felt
mary
sympathetic
hand
in
hers
and
divined
instinctively
that
the
thoughts
of
every
girl
in
the
room
were
busy
with
her
shattered
record
am
sorry
ernestine
said
miss
horton
not
unkindly
as
she
took
up
her
pencil
and
opened
the
portentous
covers
of
the
conduct
book
you
really
think
it
was
worth
while
lulu
jennings
snickered
but
quickly
recovered
herself
with
a
prim
pursing
of
the
lips
apparently
she
was
the
one
person
in
the
room
to
experience
any
touch
of
satisfaction
in
the
public
downfall
of
plaster
which
speaks
pretty
well
for
popularity
it
seems
to
me
mean
declared
mary
hobart
indignantly
some
later
to
the
little
group
of
sympathisers
who
lingered
in
the
schoolyard
till
ernie
should
be
released
was
all
a
plot
and
to
think
that
i
should
have
helped
to
lead
ernie
into
it
well
more
determined
than
ever
that
she
shall
win
the
prize
we
let
her
feel
too
discouraged
girls
we
the
poor
silly
darling
and
now
lest
you
mistake
me
for
a
wizard
i
will
confess
that
mary
came
home
with
ernie
after
school
the
two
girls
talked
the
excitement
over
as
they
set
the
table
for
dinner
while
i
stood
in
the
kitchen
doorway
and
listened
in
hand
till
i
felt
quite
as
if
i
had
witnessed
it
all
myself
so
i
have
set
it
down
here
though
it
is
hard
to
snatch
time
on
a
monday
tuesday
january
oh
dear
i
am
tired
i
have
been
ironing
all
day
only
seventeen
illustration
i
stood
in
the
kitchen
doorway
and
listened
sunday
january
you
any
idea
how
poor
we
are
it
is
half
funny
and
half
terrible
to
keep
house
for
a
family
of
six
people
on
seven
dollars
a
week
just
at
first
it
did
not
seem
impossible
there
was
a
false
impetus
so
to
speak
coal
in
the
cellar
coffee
oatmeal
flour
in
the
kitchen
cupboard
for
a
while
we
were
even
able
to
keep
up
a
semblance
of
our
usual
table
and
miss
brown
did
not
seem
to
suspect
but
she
must
find
out
soon
will
she
leave
us
when
she
knows
what
shall
we
do
if
she
does
each
meal
is
a
crisis
i
grow
quite
white
and
shaky
before
sounding
the
bell
mother
still
refuses
to
draw
anything
from
the
bank
and
we
borrow
of
uncle
george
either
because
he
was
so
hateful
after
the
hancocks
left
and
said
things
about
father
that
it
will
be
hard
to
forgive
if
we
had
salary
we
might
advertise
the
rooms
more
often
as
things
stand
it
is
impossible
on
account
of
that
dreadful
dollar
why
did
he
have
to
lose
so
much
money
haze
he
had
made
such
sacrifices
to
earn
something
just
for
us
why
did
hudson
have
to
go
and
the
hancocks
too
oh
i
do
try
to
be
brave
but
i
feel
rebellious
worried
i
dare
go
to
bed
though
ernie
has
been
asleep
this
last
i
wish
i
were
more
like
her
and
full
of
expedients
one
thing
that
will
do
this
family
any
good
she
remarked
the
other
morning
as
she
stood
in
the
window
waiting
for
the
postman
to
come
down
the
block
a
legacy
i
have
given
up
all
hope
of
the
contract
it
simply
be
found
but
why
a
rich
relation
of
whom
never
heard
die
and
leave
us
his
wealth
such
things
have
been
known
to
and
now
absurdly
we
are
all
expecting
it
even
mother
starts
at
the
sound
of
the
familiar
whistle
and
some
one
of
us
rushes
breathless
to
the
door
to
glower
through
the
letters
that
are
handed
in
heaven
knows
why
we
any
rich
relation
except
uncle
george
i
suppose
it
just
shows
how
desperate
we
are
saturday
is
and
we
younger
ones
have
acquired
the
habit
of
gulping
our
breakfast
on
that
particular
morning
and
leaving
the
table
as
expeditiously
as
possible
so
as
to
give
miss
brown
who
is
very
delicate
where
money
matters
are
concerned
an
early
opportunity
to
settle
she
do
it
will
she
say
she
is
going
to
leave
we
whisper
anxiously
to
one
another
as
we
hang
over
the
basement
banisters
and
haze
make
up
his
mind
to
go
downtown
till
he
knows
yesterday
morning
we
had
a
dreadful
fright
miss
brown
came
down
a
little
late
her
expression
was
troubled
almost
severe
when
she
put
her
pocket
handkerchief
into
her
lap
we
made
sure
that
her
purse
was
not
concealed
as
usual
among
the
folds
i
be
excused
mother
dear
piped
ernie
she
had
only
just
begun
her
want
to
go
up
to
the
nursery
and
sit
with
haze
and
i
followed
as
quickly
as
we
could
and
then
the
waiting
began
it
seemed
as
if
mother
and
miss
brown
would
never
be
done
we
could
hear
their
voices
in
low
earnest
discussion
exclaimed
hazard
game
is
but
it
miss
brown
had
had
facial
neuralgia
during
the
night
she
was
asking
mother
for
remedies
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
whether
it
would
be
wise
to
put
off
the
shopping
trip
that
she
had
planned
her
purse
was
with
her
as
usual
saved
again
and
the
funny
thing
is
once
we
get
those
seven
dollars
we
feel
quite
rich
for
a
few
hours
mother
and
shall
we
have
for
breakfast
one
asks
the
other
magnificently
notice
that
are
selling
two
for
would
make
a
nice
change
comes
the
cheerful
reply
scallops
and
not
that
we
ever
commit
ourselves
to
any
such
extravagance
but
the
little
flight
is
exhilarating
and
the
final
compromise
on
oranges
and
not
too
abrupt
it
is
true
are
fed
from
day
to
day
like
the
sparrows
if
we
can
only
wait
and
have
patience
i
suppose
things
will
come
out
right
in
the
end
and
i
said
that
i
wanted
to
be
good
this
year
well
i
believe
i
could
be
on
ten
dollars
more
a
week
friday
january
this
afternoon
a
lady
called
to
look
at
rooms
she
had
a
little
girl
with
her
perhaps
a
couple
of
years
older
than
robin
she
said
that
she
had
been
recommended
to
us
hudson
ernie
let
them
in
and
galloped
upstairs
to
tell
mother
you
can
imagine
our
excitement
whispered
ernie
as
she
and
i
crouched
behind
the
nursery
door
listening
with
all
our
ears
told
me
the
location
was
what
she
wanted
oh
elizabeth
elizabeth
at
that
moment
the
lady
swept
on
her
way
downstairs
terms
seem
reasonable
enough
we
heard
her
observe
the
room
is
sunny
and
pleasant
i
should
want
a
comfortable
cot
placed
in
it
for
lilian
little
girl
have
children
of
your
own
graham
then
stopping
in
the
lower
hall
that
an
invalid
chair
she
asked
abruptly
returned
mother
belongs
to
my
little
son
is
not
at
all
well
this
his
trouble
there
was
no
hint
of
sympathy
in
the
question
complaint
replied
mother
has
not
been
strong
since
he
was
a
that
case
i
am
sorry
but
it
will
be
impossible
to
engage
the
room
came
the
unexpected
reply
is
a
very
sensitive
child
naturally
my
first
consideration
i
make
it
a
rule
to
shield
her
from
every
depressing
influence
let
me
see
are
three
other
places
on
our
list
if
we
hurry
we
can
make
time
to
visit
them
this
afternoon
the
door
closed
sharply
on
our
prospective
boarders
and
this
on
a
friday
bluest
day
in
the
week
face
was
quite
white
and
stern
as
she
came
upstairs
you
will
get
dinner
elizabeth
stay
with
robin
she
said
and
she
took
bobsie
in
her
arms
and
carried
him
tenderly
to
the
big
rocker
in
the
window
while
ernie
and
i
crept
from
the
room
might
have
known
she
was
a
friend
of
hudson
remarked
ernie
vindictively
as
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
basement
stairs
influence
indeed
like
to
depress
her
precious
lilian
for
her
ernie
i
sighed
would
have
meant
fifteen
dollars
more
each
week
we
were
to
have
beefsteak
for
dinner
mother
had
gone
around
earlier
in
the
afternoon
to
a
cheap
little
butcher
shop
we
afford
our
old
tradesmen
any
longer
and
bought
two
pounds
our
last
forty
cents
there
were
four
potatoes
in
the
oven
a
few
beans
on
the
top
of
the
stove
no
bread
be
disturbed
i
cried
run
around
to
the
myself
and
get
a
loaf
say
that
i
left
my
purse
at
home
which
will
be
perfectly
true
and
under
the
circumstances
eminently
sensible
and
that
they
can
charge
it
keep
an
eye
on
the
steak
ernie
and
the
fire
just
put
on
a
couple
of
sticks
of
right
answered
ernie
from
where
she
sat
on
the
table
dejectedly
swinging
her
legs
and
muttering
over
an
open
geography
watch
yet
when
i
returned
from
my
errand
some
few
moments
later
it
was
to
find
the
kitchen
full
of
smoke
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
pranced
ernie
frantically
blowing
upon
a
smutty
and
spluttering
gridiron
while
the
red
flames
leapt
hungrily
through
the
open
top
of
the
stove
have
you
i
cried
snatching
the
gridiron
from
blackened
fingers
steak
is
burned
to
a
cinder
friday
night
there
any
more
money
do
you
realise
what
this
means
dear
oh
dear
i
was
bounding
the
british
isles
wailed
ernie
the
fire
come
up
all
of
a
sudden
everything
began
to
blaze
of
course
i
realise
elizabeth
we
scrape
it
or
something
i
answered
transferring
the
hopelessly
charred
bit
of
steak
to
the
big
blue
platter
is
burned
quite
through
is
saturday
how
can
we
expect
miss
brown
to
keep
on
paying
seven
dollars
a
week
she
finds
out
that
we
are
unable
to
feed
her
chop
off
my
head
and
boil
it
for
her
old
dinner
sobbed
ernie
entirely
overcome
by
this
last
disaster
for
which
she
could
not
but
hold
herself
responsible
miss
it
the
house
i
mean
they
used
to
eat
such
things
once
the
british
isles
is
the
matter
asked
mother
entering
the
kitchen
at
this
moment
with
tray
and
looking
from
one
daughter
to
the
other
anything
new
happened
steak
is
burned
i
explained
briefly
are
only
beans
and
four
potatoes
left
for
off
my
head
reiterated
poor
little
ernie
deserve
it
i
was
bounding
the
british
isles
forgot
to
watch
i
wish
i
that
never
been
born
and
then
it
was
that
mother
buoyantly
unexpectedly
as
she
can
always
be
depended
upon
doing
if
only
the
situation
is
desperate
enough
mind
darlings
she
cried
with
an
airy
little
laugh
nothing
but
a
beefsteak
after
all
buy
another
i
gasped
as
if
mother
were
contemplating
the
purchase
of
a
diamond
tiara
wondered
ernie
returned
mother
quite
as
though
it
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
she
was
proposing
some
pickles
because
miss
brown
enjoys
them
perhaps
some
chocolate
creams
mother
i
remonstrated
friday
night
we
have
spent
our
last
penny
you
surely
are
not
going
to
borrow
of
uncle
george
the
things
said
denied
mother
succinctly
can
be
no
compromise
on
that
score
on
the
contrary
reap
a
little
belated
benefit
from
one
of
dear
and
she
led
the
way
to
the
library
ernie
and
i
following
in
a
state
of
stunned
but
admiring
bewilderment
and
selected
a
large
handsomely
bound
volume
from
the
lowest
shelf
of
the
old
mahogany
bookcase
is
mother
explained
your
father
paid
six
dollars
for
it
because
the
agent
was
a
young
widow
with
pathetic
blue
eyes
who
assured
him
it
would
be
of
invaluable
assistance
in
broadening
mind
haze
was
two
years
old
at
the
time
and
nobody
has
read
it
since
it
is
going
to
be
of
some
use
at
last
and
help
us
to
another
dinner
so
she
and
ernie
hustled
into
their
things
and
hurried
around
the
block
to
the
little
bookshop
where
father
used
to
snoop
in
happy
days
when
they
returned
ernie
was
quite
beaming
and
rosy
again
for
they
brought
three
pounds
of
steak
with
them
instead
of
two
as
well
as
a
jar
of
pickles
and
a
pound
of
chocolate
creams
last
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
blatant
extravagance
and
put
us
all
into
uproarious
spirits
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
and
though
friend
was
certainly
and
it
is
hard
to
be
so
poor
that
the
singeing
of
a
beefsteak
threatens
dire
calamity
think
how
splendid
it
is
to
have
such
a
wonder
of
a
mother
yes
haze
and
i
are
agreed
there
are
compensations
in
every
lot
wednesday
january
we
have
formed
ourselves
into
a
secret
society
ernie
and
i
it
is
called
magnanimous
and
this
is
the
way
it
happened
there
is
never
enough
to
go
round
at
our
table
any
more
though
the
lowest
shelf
of
the
old
mahogany
bookcase
is
beginning
to
show
some
quite
distressing
gaps
and
naturally
miss
brown
has
to
be
helped
first
and
most
liberally
to
everything
what
she
does
not
get
is
just
about
enough
for
three
unfortunately
there
are
five
of
us
make
so
much
difference
complained
ernie
the
other
evening
only
things
could
be
managed
with
a
little
more
fairness
and
system
i
look
fat
i
know
but
that
does
not
prevent
my
growing
hungry
and
tired
of
pretending
that
i
have
no
appetite
and
being
threatened
with
tonic
good
gracious
like
to
know
what
would
happen
if
mother
give
it
to
me
i
only
refused
macaroni
this
evening
because
i
knew
haze
and
if
we
both
took
it
there
would
be
nothing
left
for
you
was
it
very
good
elizabeth
i
admitted
was
nice
filling
questioned
ernie
course
sure
haze
intend
to
be
mean
he
has
a
cough
and
a
habit
of
looking
sort
of
pathetic
which
takes
awfully
well
with
mother
but
all
the
same
it
hurt
him
to
notice
and
deny
himself
something
once
a
week
would
it
must
remember
the
wretched
luncheons
he
has
ernie
i
said
he
eats
them
in
churchyard
retorted
ernie
very
pleasant
spot
and
reads
the
old
epitaphs
and
goes
in
to
look
at
the
windows
then
she
poured
a
little
of
milk
into
a
saucer
for
rosebud
and
set
it
down
on
the
hearth
she
soliloquised
fair
and
not
going
to
stand
the
following
day
it
happened
that
we
were
to
have
lamb
stew
with
barley
for
dinner
it
set
on
the
back
of
the
stove
and
simmered
gently
all
the
afternoon
while
every
now
and
again
an
appetising
whiff
would
be
wafted
to
the
dull
cold
nursery
where
ernie
mary
hobart
and
robin
were
gathered
about
the
sewing
table
in
the
window
playing
and
the
tip
of
poor
little
nose
was
quite
red
her
hands
were
numb
and
chilly
as
she
dealt
the
cards
she
did
not
feel
in
the
least
convivial
indeed
she
confessed
to
me
later
that
judging
from
the
symptoms
going
on
inside
her
she
supposed
she
must
be
starving
and
had
only
a
few
hours
more
to
live
robin
also
was
restless
and
inattentive
but
mary
hobart
having
lunched
comfortably
at
home
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
game
have
another
deal
she
cried
been
old
maid
three
times
a
shameful
slander
and
i
go
home
till
my
luck
changes
cut
ernie
getting
pretty
dark
hinted
ernie
glancing
through
the
window
at
the
beaconing
streetlights
your
mother
worry
no
returned
mary
disappointingly
knows
where
i
am
and
expects
me
to
be
so
robin
and
ernie
played
politely
and
hungrily
on
that
stew
did
smell
so
good
till
at
last
the
gong
sounded
and
mary
was
obliged
to
go
but
even
then
ernie
must
help
her
into
coat
and
hat
before
she
could
scamper
down
to
join
the
family
in
the
you
have
a
little
stew
hazard
dear
mother
was
asking
as
ernie
slipped
with
watchful
eyes
into
her
belated
place
i
had
already
been
served
there
were
probably
three
spoonfuls
left
in
the
platter
the
case
was
desperate
ernie
realising
this
leaned
tragically
over
and
gave
one
swift
violent
kick
beneath
the
table
there
resounded
a
smothered
shriek
from
miss
brown
the
warning
had
miscarried
i
beg
your
pardon
cries
ernie
was
hazard
i
to
kick
in
thunder
retorted
haze
then
in
a
sudden
burst
of
hurt
enlightenment
you
are
a
pig
i
going
to
take
any
of
your
old
mother
quietly
helped
the
two
combatants
apologised
to
miss
brown
for
and
dined
upon
dry
bread
herself
it
was
later
in
the
kitchen
that
we
gave
haze
a
talking
to
and
i
he
was
very
repentant
said
he
really
had
not
noticed
the
scarcity
before
and
thought
idea
of
a
excellent
so
the
society
was
organised
we
are
to
take
turns
saying
we
do
not
care
for
things
vegetables
or
pudding
as
the
case
may
be
but
you
believe
it
noon
at
luncheon
miss
brown
actually
refused
a
fishcake
remarking
that
she
believed
she
was
suffering
from
slight
perhaps
she
has
suspected
all
along
we
need
not
worry
as
we
do
each
saturday
morning
oh
if
this
is
true
what
a
she
has
been
for
she
talks
politics
and
the
latest
novel
in
the
most
natural
manner
in
the
world
neither
complains
nor
criticises
and
seems
quite
oblivious
to
our
many
and
obvious
shortcomings
prim
generous
tactful
darling
saturday
january
we
have
had
to
give
rosebud
away
and
ernie
and
robin
are
quite
heartbroken
it
was
because
he
drank
so
much
of
milk
seems
pretty
hard
to
have
to
regard
a
kitten
as
an
extravagance
muttered
ernie
rebelliously
as
she
sat
in
the
this
morning
clasping
rosebud
to
an
indignant
brown
gingham
bosom
going
to
tell
bobs
like
to
know
all
very
well
for
mother
to
say
we
afford
it
there
are
some
things
that
people
to
be
very
happy
with
mary
hobart
dear
i
coaxed
you
know
he
is
growing
up
and
has
an
enormous
appetite
and
he
even
try
to
catch
mice
white
ones
milk
is
eight
cents
a
quart
make
it
any
harder
for
mother
she
feels
it
as
much
as
any
of
course
mary
will
be
delighted
continued
ernie
bitterly
have
to
lie
and
say
it
is
because
we
want
to
make
her
a
handsome
present
chums
are
pretty
disappointing
sometimes
i
understand
geof
elizabeth
a
boy
who
has
three
dollars
a
week
could
certainly
afford
to
offer
to
buy
a
little
once
in
a
while
not
that
let
geoffrey
do
it
of
course
but
it
would
be
nice
to
feel
that
he
wanted
to
he
used
to
be
so
sweet
and
sympathetic
when
i
was
in
trouble
and
he
hardly
seems
to
notice
any
more
why
not
been
in
to
see
me
for
over
a
week
he
is
busy
at
school
i
answered
be
glad
to
think
geof
was
really
studying
in
it
that
returned
ernie
has
extra
tutoring
i
know
but
he
shirks
it
whenever
he
gets
the
chance
and
slips
off
to
keep
some
appointment
with
that
horrid
jim
hollister
and
sam
jacobs
they
are
not
the
kind
of
fellows
he
ought
to
go
then
with
a
swift
return
to
the
more
immediate
and
poignant
woe
rosebud
dear
pussy
too
ridiculous
so
poor
one
afford
to
keep
a
kitten
that
was
the
part
we
found
next
to
impossible
to
explain
to
robin
know
what
you
mean
he
sobbed
after
the
first
outburst
of
violent
grief
was
over
like
rosebud
to
drink
my
milk
elizabeth
good
for
good
for
you
too
bobsie
dear
i
said
you
are
sick
and
rosebud
mother
afford
to
buy
more
than
one
quart
a
day
know
questioned
robin
means
that
we
the
money
we
are
poor
robin
looked
at
me
out
of
wondering
eyes
he
echoed
the
people
in
stories
oh
ellie
then
he
sighed
and
soothed
my
hand
and
was
very
sweet
and
patient
all
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
he
even
bade
to
rosebud
with
fond
stoical
precision
patting
the
kitten
on
the
head
and
remarking
is
best
that
we
should
part
dear
loving
little
fellow
i
really
believe
the
information
came
to
him
as
quite
a
shock
but
fancy
his
having
to
be
told
when
haze
came
up
from
tending
the
furnace
his
face
was
even
more
and
anxious
than
usual
much
is
there
left
i
asked
inevitable
question
careful
it
may
last
till
the
middle
of
next
week
returned
hazard
grimly
i
suppose
begin
pawning
the
spoons
odd
world
certainly
it
is
hard
for
hazey
one
blame
him
for
occasional
bitterness
he
is
working
faithfully
and
well
in
uncongenial
surroundings
and
has
not
had
a
cent
of
pay
for
weeks
while
geof
who
is
showered
with
the
very
advantages
for
which
haze
so
ardently
longs
seems
sullenly
determined
to
make
no
use
of
them
oh
the
contrast
is
cruel
but
mother
says
the
struggle
is
bringing
out
a
new
manliness
and
in
haze
that
are
a
daily
surprise
and
joy
to
her
roses
again
mother
but
something
had
hurry
up
and
happen
soon
wednesday
january
he
thought
he
saw
a
clerk
descending
from
the
he
looked
again
and
found
it
was
a
hippopotamus
this
should
stay
to
dine
he
said
be
much
for
us
we
did
not
think
it
was
a
clerk
but
a
boarder
robin
sitting
in
the
wicker
rocker
in
the
window
spied
him
first
he
piped
in
his
shrill
little
treble
just
know
that
big
fat
man
is
coming
here
he
is
going
to
ring
our
and
engage
all
the
empty
rooms
see
if
he
and
the
prophecy
came
true
it
was
almost
like
the
relief
of
lucknow
on
a
sudden
the
garrison
utter
a
jubilant
shout
for
oh
i
know
how
much
longer
we
could
have
held
out
it
was
day
before
yesterday
that
it
happened
i
had
wakened
with
a
start
in
the
early
chill
grey
morning
trying
dully
to
remember
how
many
potatoes
still
remained
in
the
bottom
of
the
vegetable
box
and
whether
there
was
coffee
enough
to
tide
us
through
the
week
it
was
certain
that
the
coal
would
not
last
should
we
begin
pawning
the
spoons
then
haze
predicted
maybe
watch
and
suddenly
it
seemed
as
if
life
were
not
worth
living
any
longer
i
did
not
feel
as
if
i
could
get
up
and
make
my
way
candle
in
hand
down
the
narrow
kitchen
stairs
to
an
arctic
basement
and
a
sordid
round
of
housework
it
was
monday
too
the
very
thought
made
my
back
ache
and
my
head
swim
mother
must
not
suspect
because
i
had
persuaded
her
that
the
washing
was
not
too
much
for
me
in
fact
that
i
rather
enjoyed
it
and
to
be
sure
at
the
very
beginning
it
had
not
seemed
so
bad
novelty
lent
spice
with
the
optimism
of
ignorance
i
determined
that
mind
as
well
as
muscles
should
be
exercised
while
scrubbing
i
would
learn
french
poetry
so
with
sleeves
rolled
above
the
elbow
the
splashing
in
my
hot
face
i
rubbed
rinsed
and
wringered
murmuring
the
while
o
richard
ô
mon
roi
sur
la
terre
il
donc
que
moi
qui
à
ta
personne
or
in
more
romantic
vein
nait
et
ta
porte
est
close
ma
belle
pourquoi
sommeiller
a
où
la
rose
ne
pas
te
réveiller
but
this
particular
morning
there
was
no
enthusiasm
left
my
brain
was
dull
my
tongue
stumbled
and
tripped
over
the
most
familiar
lines
i
could
not
control
my
thoughts
haze
had
a
cough
and
nothing
but
a
sweet
potato
sandwich
for
luncheon
struggle
was
too
unfair
too
hopeless
actually
i
caught
myself
weeping
into
the
washtub
bedewing
the
family
linen
with
splashing
tears
certainly
things
did
look
black
it
was
over
a
month
since
the
hancocks
had
left
us
nearly
two
since
we
bade
farewell
to
hudson
even
mother
was
beginning
to
show
the
strain
she
looked
worn
and
worried
as
for
me
i
was
of
the
the
sweeping
the
dusting
everything
to
be
done
afresh
each
day
i
had
not
touched
my
mandolin
for
weeks
my
hands
then
puffed
and
scarlet
would
be
stiff
and
cracked
on
the
morrow
i
held
them
up
and
looked
at
them
which
brought
the
thought
of
meta
and
the
old
inevitable
contrast
that
very
evening
she
was
going
to
a
party
pretty
informal
affair
consisting
of
charades
a
supper
and
a
dance
how
her
life
was
how
happily
exempt
from
sordid
considerations
she
was
surrounded
by
attention
gayety
admiration
would
love
such
things
too
a
great
fat
tear
rolled
off
the
tip
of
my
nose
and
splashed
down
on
little
striped
pajamas
come
i
told
myself
is
ridiculous
cheer
up
child
and
repeat
if
you
remember
any
but
even
stirring
lines
with
which
haze
and
i
have
heartened
each
other
since
nursery
days
seemed
to
have
lost
their
magic
porsena
of
clusium
i
began
and
ended
on
a
sob
till
quite
unexpectedly
without
the
least
premeditation
i
found
myself
murmuring
instead
lord
raise
up
we
pray
thee
thy
power
and
come
among
us
and
with
great
might
succour
us
that
whereas
through
our
sins
and
wickedness
we
are
sore
let
and
hindered
in
running
the
race
that
is
set
before
us
thy
bountiful
grace
and
mercy
may
speedily
help
and
deliver
us
it
was
the
beautiful
collect
for
the
fourth
sunday
in
advent
there
seemed
nothing
incongruous
in
repeating
it
above
a
washtub
either
instantly
i
dried
my
tears
through
our
sins
and
wickedness
we
are
sore
let
and
hindered
in
running
the
race
that
is
set
before
us
was
the
whole
trouble
parties
indeed
attention
what
did
they
matter
to
a
girl
blessed
with
the
dearest
family
in
the
world
to
love
and
work
for
my
back
stopped
aching
i
thought
of
little
patient
robin
upstairs
in
the
big
rocker
to
play
with
his
his
pale
cheeks
would
flush
with
pleasure
if
i
could
manage
to
hang
out
the
clothes
in
time
to
sit
with
him
a
few
moments
before
lunch
it
was
worth
trying
for
and
so
i
did
it
was
that
very
morning
if
you
please
that
bobsie
looking
down
the
street
uttered
his
jubilant
shout
boarder
a
boarder
his
name
is
lysle
he
has
a
square
bland
face
a
portly
presence
and
a
heavy
artillery
voice
it
was
ernie
who
dubbed
him
he
has
rented
our
three
empty
rooms
at
the
biggest
price
we
have
yet
received
for
them
and
he
and
his
wife
and
his
sister
will
move
in
on
saturday
oh
how
beautiful
we
should
have
been
so
helped
and
brave
little
elizabeth
said
mother
to
me
late
this
evening
have
been
such
a
comfort
such
a
support
but
it
is
over
now
dear
we
will
send
for
rose
to
come
back
we
will
order
furnace
coal
drawn
on
our
bank
then
she
kissed
me
and
i
blushed
for
very
shame
for
i
have
not
been
brave
know
that
old
diary
least
not
how
i
wish
that
i
might
look
back
and
honestly
feel
that
i
have
earned
precious
praise
friday
february
school
politics
have
been
exciting
these
last
few
weeks
though
in
the
stress
and
strain
of
home
affairs
i
have
had
no
time
to
report
them
but
ernie
has
taken
them
very
seriously
and
for
her
sake
we
are
glad
the
end
has
come
yesterday
the
sixth
grammar
grade
was
promoted
and
the
name
read
aloud
from
the
platform
can
you
guess
who
it
was
let
me
take
the
matter
up
where
i
dropped
it
though
naturally
much
discouraged
and
depressed
by
her
sudden
fall
from
grace
that
fatal
composition
day
ernie
bravely
determined
to
retrieve
her
shattered
fortunes
in
this
resolve
she
was
supported
by
mary
hobart
hatty
walker
and
a
host
of
other
friends
was
nothing
but
a
ghastly
accident
they
urged
along
by
lulu
jennings
and
though
of
course
a
couple
of
failures
will
pull
down
your
per
they
need
not
entirely
ruin
it
you
are
cleverer
than
lulu
look
at
arithmetic
alone
and
the
visiting
problems
she
solved
one
of
hold
entirely
responsible
for
that
returned
ernie
quaintly
am
quite
sure
he
never
intended
they
should
be
you
have
worked
out
answers
to
them
retorted
mary
ernie
admitted
different
answer
every
the
problems
in
question
were
certainly
difficult
there
were
ten
of
them
composed
by
visiting
and
it
was
rumoured
among
the
girls
that
even
miss
horton
herself
could
not
obtain
a
correct
solution
they
were
intended
for
during
the
term
on
the
express
understanding
that
one
of
the
set
no
one
could
predict
which
should
be
included
in
the
final
examinations
naturally
they
were
the
subject
of
much
and
anxious
discussion
lulu
jennings
in
particular
suffered
agonies
of
apprehensive
doubt
arithmetic
is
not
her
strong
point
think
fair
she
declared
just
meant
to
muddle
us
the
idea
of
making
up
such
stuff
out
of
his
own
head
there
any
key
or
any
way
to
prove
and
the
answers
are
not
even
in
the
back
of
miss
book
i
know
questioned
mary
hobart
and
lulu
dropped
her
eyes
and
coloured
uncomfortably
it
was
after
her
public
disgrace
that
ernie
wrote
out
the
entire
set
of
problems
in
a
purchased
for
the
purpose
so
that
she
might
study
them
quietly
at
home
and
how
the
child
did
wrestle
herself
in
the
workshop
saturday
after
saturday
till
finally
she
discovered
the
correct
solution
there
could
be
no
doubt
worked
out
along
certain
intricate
lines
the
problems
could
be
proved
the
next
morning
which
happened
to
be
the
very
day
before
examination
ernie
carried
her
precious
book
down
to
school
she
yodeled
to
mary
hobart
who
formed
one
of
a
group
of
chattering
girls
on
the
second
landing
have
the
answers
to
the
visiting
problems
returned
mary
excitedly
ernie
replied
unable
to
repress
her
glee
are
here
tapping
the
book
as
she
spoke
they
are
right
too
they
prove
those
had
time
for
at
that
moment
lulu
jennings
brushed
past
the
excited
pair
apparently
she
was
deep
in
conversation
with
a
friend
and
noticed
nothing
only
she
guessed
chuckled
ernestine
for
sake
tell
her
warned
mary
the
cautious
trust
that
girl
with
her
own
plated
you
take
me
for
a
goose
asked
ernie
put
our
books
up
and
perhaps
have
time
to
eat
an
apple
before
the
bell
rings
i
have
a
beauty
in
my
blouse
so
the
two
girls
ran
up
to
the
classroom
where
they
found
that
lulu
had
preceded
them
slipped
their
books
into
their
respective
desks
and
returning
to
the
schoolyard
divided
the
apple
wish
i
could
explain
the
problems
to
you
mary
dear
ernie
said
of
course
it
be
fair
it
was
quite
by
chance
i
hit
on
the
right
way
you
can
imagine
my
joy
i
have
only
had
time
to
prove
the
first
six
but
the
others
must
be
right
work
on
them
at
however
long
before
noon
ernie
slipped
her
hand
into
her
desk
to
take
out
the
beloved
book
and
reassure
herself
by
a
hasty
glance
through
its
pages
she
owns
several
one
for
spelling
a
second
for
and
a
third
for
english
these
were
successively
dragged
out
and
hastily
thrust
back
again
with
a
queer
little
shock
it
became
certain
that
the
book
containing
the
solution
to
the
problems
was
missing
ernie
was
puzzled
startled
but
just
at
first
she
felt
no
suspicion
perhaps
she
had
not
put
the
book
into
her
desk
after
all
perhaps
she
had
dropped
it
on
the
landing
in
the
hall
it
was
impossible
to
communicate
her
loss
to
mary
hobart
who
had
been
sent
to
the
blackboard
to
demonstrate
a
proposition
so
ernie
raised
her
hand
and
asked
miss
permission
to
leave
the
room
to
look
for
something
the
request
was
granted
yet
a
hurried
search
of
the
stairways
revealed
nothing
and
the
more
ernie
reflected
the
more
anxious
she
became
she
returned
to
the
classroom
thoroughly
puzzled
and
what
was
her
amazement
to
discover
the
missing
book
lying
in
plain
view
on
her
desk
ernie
took
it
up
incredulously
was
instantly
conscious
of
a
faint
scent
of
musk
she
turned
to
mary
hobart
who
was
just
about
to
resume
her
seat
having
finished
her
work
at
the
board
and
fairly
hissed
of
lulu
mary
smell
her
quick
mary
looked
at
ernie
in
bewilderment
to
she
whispered
back
should
i
like
to
know
on
commanded
ernie
too
excited
to
explain
her
you
must
so
mary
with
a
puzzled
and
somewhat
resentful
air
inclined
her
head
stiffly
toward
lulu
jennings
and
began
to
sniff
questioned
ernie
with
dilating
eyes
returned
mary
crossly
smells
of
cheap
perfume
as
usual
musk
i
hope
returned
ernie
quietly
so
i
a
doubt
is
lulu
she
has
copied
my
problems
tell
you
after
certainly
the
evidence
seemed
conclusive
enough
and
mary
added
still
other
links
to
the
chain
you
remember
she
said
was
at
her
desk
when
we
put
our
things
away
this
morning
while
we
were
eating
that
apple
she
must
have
taken
the
book
and
no
sooner
did
you
leave
the
room
to
look
for
it
than
she
asked
permission
to
put
some
stuff
in
the
i
noticed
from
the
blackboard
that
she
paused
at
your
desk
on
her
way
back
she
must
certainly
have
returned
it
yet
what
was
to
be
done
the
affair
was
entirely
too
complicated
to
take
to
miss
horton
even
if
ernie
could
have
made
up
her
mind
to
that
course
she
returned
to
suggestion
just
no
rather
give
up
all
thought
of
the
prize
even
if
i
have
worked
so
hard
for
it
if
lulu
jennings
can
enjoy
the
books
earned
this
way
welcome
to
and
ernie
thrust
the
fatal
into
the
very
bottom
of
her
and
snapped
to
the
catch
with
a
click
the
next
morning
examinations
began
with
arithmetic
first
as
usual
every
girl
in
the
class
surveyed
her
paper
anxiously
in
search
of
the
famous
problem
it
was
there
ninth
of
the
four
which
ernie
had
neglected
to
prove
at
first
this
was
rather
a
disappointment
but
having
given
up
all
hope
of
winning
the
prize
ernie
quickly
dismissed
the
matter
and
set
quietly
to
work
merely
determining
to
pass
as
creditably
as
she
could
the
moments
flew
quickly
by
absorbed
in
her
calculations
ernie
forgot
all
feeling
of
pique
or
disappointment
nor
did
she
again
think
of
lulu
jennings
till
having
finished
her
paper
she
passed
it
under
final
review
when
something
struck
her
eye
she
gave
a
little
bounce
in
her
seat
and
caught
her
breath
sharply
the
answer
obtained
to
the
problem
was
different
from
that
which
she
had
written
out
before
she
remembered
distinctly
what
that
other
answer
was
and
went
hastily
over
the
work
before
her
to
see
where
the
mistake
lay
but
it
was
right
it
proved
figure
by
figure
ernie
followed
the
intricate
proposition
to
which
without
a
doubt
she
had
at
last
obtained
the
correct
solution
what
had
been
wrong
before
she
did
not
know
nor
did
she
much
care
instinctively
her
glance
sought
lulu
jennings
who
sat
with
head
bent
low
above
her
desk
at
the
same
moment
lulu
raised
her
eyes
she
did
not
look
at
ernie
but
cautiously
toward
miss
horton
who
was
standing
at
the
blackboard
with
her
back
toward
the
class
lulu
seeing
this
darted
a
stealthy
hand
into
her
desk
and
brought
out
a
little
roll
of
paper
which
she
placed
in
her
lap
at
the
same
moment
throwing
her
handkerchief
over
it
ernie
did
not
wait
for
anything
further
but
rising
from
her
seat
carried
her
paper
to
miss
desk
no
one
paid
any
attention
as
it
is
customary
for
the
girls
to
put
up
their
papers
when
finished
on
her
way
back
ernie
stopped
beside
lulu
just
long
enough
to
whisper
bother
to
copy
that
lulu
turned
first
white
then
red
she
clutched
the
paper
in
her
lap
whether
she
heeded
warning
makes
little
difference
the
mark
she
received
was
not
especially
creditable
and
ernie
who
passed
a
nearly
perfect
examination
came
out
head
and
was
awarded
the
prize
after
all
think
elizabeth
she
chortled
worth
of
books
fill
up
the
bottom
shelf
of
the
mahogany
bookcase
again
i
have
my
list
all
made
out
for
robin
conquest
of
for
hazard
poems
for
you
dear
autocrat
of
the
breakfast
for
mother
the
visiting
board
read
the
titles
aloud
from
the
platform
and
said
it
was
remarkably
comprehensive
ernie
i
expostulated
have
you
for
yourself
says
told
you
i
was
going
to
use
them
for
birthday
presents
my
birthday
is
past
and
besides
i
wanted
nice
editions
and
i
really
think
made
the
money
go
as
far
as
anybody
could
is
very
sweet
of
you
honey
i
said
we
will
share
that
longfellow
mary
and
the
other
girls
delighted
they
are
admitted
ernie
with
an
ingenuous
little
skip
quite
the
heroine
of
their
young
hearts
lots
of
fun
elizabeth
only
sorry
for
lulu
it
must
be
horrid
for
her
to
look
back
and
think
how
mean
she
has
been
all
for
nothing
too
wednesday
february
our
precious
robin
has
been
far
from
well
lately
for
some
time
now
he
has
almost
given
up
trying
to
walk
his
crutches
seemed
to
tire
him
more
and
more
and
his
left
side
has
become
so
helpless
that
when
he
did
attempt
to
get
about
it
reminded
one
of
a
little
lame
bird
trailing
a
broken
wing
the
greater
part
of
the
day
he
has
passed
propped
up
with
pillows
in
the
big
rocker
in
the
window
or
lying
in
his
little
crib
because
he
was
to
sit
up
and
the
deepening
shadows
beneath
his
eyes
have
quite
wrung
our
hearts
porter
has
been
very
kind
and
attentive
but
far
from
satisfied
and
last
week
the
stern
edict
went
forth
robin
was
to
go
to
bed
and
stay
there
for
no
less
a
period
than
six
weeks
with
a
heavy
weight
attached
to
his
little
thin
leg
well
there
is
one
comfort
our
darling
baby
seems
more
like
himself
since
he
has
been
forced
at
last
to
give
up
he
has
lost
some
of
the
languor
and
gentle
indifference
that
seemed
to
be
growing
on
him
his
merry
grin
flashes
forth
with
reassuring
frequency
followed
by
the
deep
dimple
high
in
his
cheek
is
resting
said
the
doctor
he
needs
it
that
boy
is
grit
clear
through
quality
of
which
i
approve
in
patients
miss
you
rather
have
them
whine
i
asked
returned
the
doctor
uncompromisingly
but
robin
will
never
do
that
in
the
first
place
everybody
is
too
good
to
him
burroughs
miss
brown
and
the
three
lysles
indeed
lysle
is
kind
as
kind
can
be
he
has
brought
fruit
for
bobsie
several
times
and
seems
quite
distressed
because
little
has
not
a
better
appetite
he
declared
that
he
really
did
not
see
the
child
managed
to
survive
on
such
a
small
amount
of
whereat
ernie
giggled
and
i
had
some
difficulty
controlling
my
countenance
for
it
was
at
the
table
the
observation
was
rumbled
forth
just
as
the
kind
was
finishing
his
third
helping
of
turkey
yes
turkey
if
you
please
though
certainly
it
did
seem
some
weeks
ago
as
if
the
little
grahams
could
never
again
claim
even
so
much
as
a
bowing
acquaintance
with
that
royal
bird
and
after
the
turkey
came
ice
cream
and
mince
pie
served
by
rose
in
a
spotless
cap
and
apron
while
rosebud
purred
upon
the
warm
hearth
in
the
kitchen
waiting
his
turn
to
lick
the
plates
for
no
sooner
did
plenty
begin
to
smile
again
upon
our
household
than
ernie
naughty
demanded
back
her
pet
would
just
as
soon
have
one
of
the
new
kittens
she
affirmed
asked
him
about
it
and
he
says
we
may
take
our
so
the
compromise
was
effected
rosebud
sleek
and
debonair
as
ever
returned
to
grace
our
home
such
a
welcome
as
the
children
gave
him
indeed
we
were
all
glad
things
have
not
been
so
comfortable
for
months
reminds
me
of
poem
it
was
this
morning
while
i
was
washing
his
face
that
bobs
repeated
it
to
me
a
little
soap
got
into
his
eyes
he
screwed
them
up
and
then
remarked
must
be
more
careful
elizabeth
when
you
wash
me
else
my
poem
stay
poem
bobsie
i
repeated
though
certainly
by
this
time
i
should
be
accustomed
to
the
family
weakness
answered
robin
shyly
wrote
one
you
know
and
haze
too
i
thought
i
would
shall
i
say
it
and
without
waiting
to
be
pressed
he
graciously
began
what
a
lucky
child
am
i
as
here
upon
my
bed
i
lie
with
all
my
needs
and
wants
supplied
my
food
and
everything
beside
clams
and
white
mice
and
kittens
all
and
when
cold
my
that
pretty
it
is
honey
i
answered
did
you
come
to
think
of
it
confessed
robin
been
crying
just
a
little
yesterday
ellie
because
i
wanted
to
pertend
to
play
tag
and
i
see
out
the
window
and
so
i
had
to
blow
my
nose
and
i
felt
for
my
hankersniff
under
the
pillow
and
it
was
i
have
to
ring
or
anything
and
that
made
me
think
how
lucky
i
am
and
so
i
made
up
the
poem
is
it
nice
enough
to
be
written
down
certainly
is
i
answered
will
put
it
in
my
diary
and
some
day
when
you
are
a
big
fat
man
ellie
will
read
it
aloud
to
you
and
we
will
both
will
we
laugh
ellie
dear
asked
robin
innocently
we
will
be
so
glad
that
the
little
sick
boy
who
composed
it
grew
up
strong
and
well
i
answered
and
so
i
have
written
here
that
i
may
be
able
to
fulfil
my
part
of
the
prophecy
but
now
i
want
to
talk
a
little
of
geoffrey
for
we
are
really
anxious
about
him
there
is
no
doubt
the
boy
is
very
much
changed
yesterday
afternoon
he
dropped
in
to
see
ernie
nearly
an
hour
before
school
was
out
geof
i
said
are
you
doing
here
so
early
it
is
scarcely
two
ernie
home
yet
did
you
have
a
geoffrey
looked
confused
your
clocks
are
wrong
he
answered
you
give
a
fellow
a
bit
of
lunch
elizabeth
thought
you
got
your
lunch
at
school
i
returned
of
course
you
are
hungry
rose
has
just
finished
baking
that
luck
and
i
ran
down
to
the
kitchen
where
a
glass
of
milk
a
couple
of
bananas
and
a
plate
of
hot
were
quickly
collected
geof
ate
in
silence
crumbling
his
over
the
tray
cloth
on
the
library
table
i
remonstrated
too
good
to
waste
what
you
want
i
am
going
to
take
up
to
right
answered
geof
pushing
his
plate
indifferently
toward
me
is
the
kid
then
he
broke
into
a
short
chuckle
say
elizabeth
he
remarked
a
trained
bear
out
at
the
zoo
that
would
tickle
bobs
most
to
death
been
feeding
it
peanuts
all
the
morning
gentle
as
a
kitten
the
keeper
says
good
sort
he
seems
too
i
accused
in
sudden
shocked
enlightenment
have
been
playing
geof
flushed
angrily
and
bit
his
lip
and
if
i
have
he
blustered
business
but
my
own
i
suppose
certainly
is
business
i
answered
decidedly
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
after
all
the
trouble
you
were
in
last
term
over
hockey
and
athletics
i
should
think
you
would
have
learned
that
such
foolishness
geof
sprang
to
his
feet
see
here
elizabeth
he
said
not
going
to
be
jawed
by
you
i
get
enough
of
that
sort
of
talk
at
home
if
you
be
pleasant
go
somewhere
else
there
are
plenty
of
other
places
where
a
chap
can
spend
the
afternoon
and
hollister
and
sam
jacobs
are
glad
enough
to
show
to
well
geoffrey
i
answered
you
choose
to
treat
the
matter
so
only
i
warn
you
frankly
in
that
case
i
shall
go
directly
upstairs
and
tell
mother
feel
that
i
have
any
choice
she
will
tell
uncle
george
i
geof
turned
on
me
incredulously
sneak
he
cried
that
sound
exactly
like
meta
geof
dear
i
expostulated
hurt
and
shocked
by
his
violence
quarrel
or
misunderstand
each
other
you
know
very
well
i
want
to
get
you
into
trouble
but
sam
jacobs
and
jim
hollister
are
not
the
sort
of
fellows
you
ought
to
associate
with
i
believe
you
really
enjoy
the
places
they
take
you
to
either
in
the
end
it
help
but
be
found
out
you
are
doing
yourself
an
injustice
geoffrey
you
are
come
sit
down
and
talk
things
over
i
laid
my
hand
on
his
arm
he
tried
to
shake
it
off
the
next
instant
his
face
changed
it
all
elizabeth
he
blurted
out
i
had
sisters
like
you
and
ernie
a
mother
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
big
strong
manly
geof
had
broken
down
and
was
sobbing
like
a
baby
his
head
buried
in
his
arms
on
the
library
table
and
presently
the
whole
wretched
story
came
out
it
seems
that
things
have
been
going
from
bad
to
worse
ever
since
last
september
it
was
only
by
unusual
pressure
brought
to
bear
by
aunt
adelaide
and
equally
unusual
acquiescence
on
the
part
of
the
school
authorities
that
geof
managed
to
be
promoted
with
his
class
this
year
and
he
entered
the
new
grade
heavily
conditioned
in
nearly
all
his
studies
this
in
itself
was
bad
but
what
made
the
matter
still
harder
was
that
in
his
case
a
weekly
report
has
been
substituted
for
the
customary
monthly
one
he
tutors
three
afternoons
a
week
and
his
progress
is
kept
under
rigid
supervision
if
not
nagged
about
french
i
am
about
latin
said
poor
geoffrey
i
tell
you
elizabeth
the
schedule
carrying
this
year
is
enough
to
daze
a
do
you
really
try
to
study
geof
i
asked
you
made
one
honest
effort
to
set
things
right
geof
flushed
i
have
he
answered
sullenly
nobody
believes
it
and
recently
had
so
many
headaches
and
i
sleep
well
nights
aunt
adelaide
knew
that
i
suggested
think
i
was
faking
concluded
geof
hardily
i
know
that
i
blame
her
much
he
admitted
the
next
minute
see
we
never
have
gotten
along
i
was
seven
when
my
own
mother
died
and
nine
when
the
governor
remarried
old
enough
to
resent
it
i
remember
for
three
weeks
i
call
her
till
finally
the
matter
was
taken
to
headquarters
and
i
had
to
and
then
meta
make
things
any
easier
we
fought
from
the
very
start
and
managed
to
set
the
governor
against
me
till
the
latest
threat
is
if
my
march
reports
show
to
be
packed
off
to
the
catskills
for
the
summer
to
a
little
tin
soldier
camp
where
the
fellows
wear
toy
uniforms
and
tutor
all
through
vacation
pleasant
prospect
geoffrey
why
in
the
world
play
hookey
i
asked
throw
away
your
last
possible
chance
of
avoiding
it
geof
was
silent
be
sensible
i
urged
do
look
black
i
admit
but
if
for
the
next
few
weeks
you
learn
the
lessons
set
each
day
and
look
neither
forward
nor
just
it
interrupted
geof
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
too
much
behind
me
elizabeth
i
learn
what
we
are
having
now
because
i
last
term
or
the
year
before
and
you
any
idea
how
hard
it
is
when
everybody
is
down
on
a
chap
now
that
out
of
athletics
the
fellows
i
used
to
go
with
have
no
further
use
for
me
i
never
did
get
along
with
the
grinds
and
hollister
jacobs
and
their
set
are
always
cordial
and
pleasant
at
least
got
to
associate
with
somebody
i
suppose
you
know
what
you
are
talking
about
i
do
geoffrey
i
replied
be
easy
to
turn
round
i
know
what
is
the
use
of
complicating
matters
still
further
right
is
right
and
wrong
wrong
and
hookey
never
paid
yet
will
you
give
me
your
word
that
you
will
go
to
school
again
geof
was
silent
and
i
waited
it
seemed
hard
unsympathetic
what
was
i
to
do
you
give
me
your
word
geof
i
reiterated
right
he
muttered
sullenly
at
last
have
the
go
to
school
and
the
day
after
i
promise
more
than
that
and
saturday
if
i
seen
the
governor
myself
you
are
welcome
to
go
and
tell
him
anything
you
please
does
that
satisfy
you
it
did
not
entirely
but
in
stubborn
mood
it
was
the
best
i
could
hope
for
and
at
least
he
will
have
time
to
think
things
over
till
the
end
of
the
week
poor
foolish
fellow
i
hope
i
be
obliged
to
tell
saturday
february
geoffrey
has
run
away
so
that
was
what
he
meant
by
promising
to
go
to
school
till
saturday
oh
i
feel
as
if
i
were
partly
responsible
yet
how
could
i
have
suspected
he
was
over
here
late
yesterday
afternoon
i
did
not
have
a
chance
to
see
him
as
mother
was
out
and
robin
rather
feverish
and
fretful
but
ernie
and
he
talked
together
in
the
workshop
for
nearly
a
couple
of
hours
and
after
he
went
ernie
came
down
to
dinner
with
such
red
eyes
is
it
dear
i
asked
at
last
when
she
and
i
were
undressing
together
in
our
little
room
geof
in
one
of
his
moods
again
for
ernie
had
been
on
the
verge
of
tears
all
the
evening
she
dropped
upon
the
bed
then
with
a
little
wail
and
buried
her
face
in
the
pillows
should
say
he
was
she
sobbed
do
a
thing
with
him
that
hateful
military
camp
enough
to
drive
anybody
to
desperation
it
settled
i
asked
geof
really
go
bother
elizabeth
returned
ernie
almost
crossly
going
to
talk
to
uncle
george
he
gets
his
allowance
fridays
you
know
and
then
she
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
and
pretended
to
go
to
sleep
but
she
was
restless
for
hours
and
once
she
cried
out
wildly
in
her
dreams
you
you
i
tell
you
no
wonder
she
was
anxious
poor
child
for
it
seems
that
geoffrey
after
having
first
obtained
a
promise
of
secrecy
confided
his
plans
to
her
yesterday
afternoon
she
is
the
only
person
who
knows
where
he
is
now
and
entreaties
and
arguments
are
equally
of
no
avail
we
simply
can
not
get
her
to
tell
the
first
alarm
reached
us
this
morning
just
as
we
had
risen
from
the
breakfast
table
there
was
a
sharp
ring
at
the
and
rose
answering
the
summons
found
maria
one
of
aunt
maids
outside
master
geoffrey
here
asked
maria
rather
breathlessly
and
upon
receiving
denial
she
cried
out
knows
become
of
him
for
he
been
home
all
the
morning
not
even
to
his
breakfast
and
missis
and
the
boss
too
are
in
a
great
taking
mother
and
i
who
were
on
our
way
upstairs
overheard
the
exclamation
and
turned
back
is
it
maria
asked
mother
after
having
sent
rose
down
to
the
kitchen
again
geoffrey
has
not
been
here
since
yesterday
you
say
he
was
not
home
to
breakfast
answered
maria
and
proceeded
to
pour
forth
her
tale
it
seems
that
geoffrey
has
been
in
the
habit
of
recently
which
indulgence
greatly
irritated
aunt
adelaide
graham
thinks
only
manners
for
the
family
to
sit
down
to
meals
together
maria
explained
this
morning
when
master
geoffrey
did
not
come
she
sent
jennie
up
to
knock
at
his
door
and
jennie
she
knocked
and
knocked
again
and
got
no
answer
so
after
a
bit
she
came
down
and
said
she
could
not
make
master
geoffrey
hear
and
graham
jumped
up
wake
him
myself
he
says
had
enough
of
this
sort
of
and
he
went
and
called
very
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
but
still
there
was
no
reply
i
was
rather
sorry
for
master
geoffrey
when
his
pa
snatched
off
one
of
his
slippers
and
ran
upstairs
and
threw
open
the
bedroom
door
going
to
catch
it
sure
enough
like
any
babby
i
thought
but
he
because
the
room
was
empty
the
bed
had
not
even
been
slept
in
says
graham
in
a
disturbed
sort
of
way
and
he
put
on
his
slipper
and
came
downstairs
again
and
directly
breakfast
was
over
they
sent
me
ernie
know
anything
of
this
asked
mother
turning
to
me
is
usual
confidante
run
upstairs
and
get
her
elizabeth
i
believe
she
has
taken
robin
his
all
the
colour
died
out
of
face
when
she
saw
me
enter
the
nursery
but
it
flooded
back
again
in
a
crimson
wave
as
she
listened
to
message
however
she
settled
bobsie
to
his
breakfast
and
quietly
followed
me
downstairs
you
any
idea
where
geoffrey
is
ernie
asked
mother
gravely
long
lashes
swept
her
cheeks
he
at
home
she
returned
in
a
tone
that
was
intended
to
sound
innocent
mother
smiled
just
a
little
be
foolish
dear
she
replied
you
know
anything
about
geoffrey
it
is
only
right
for
you
to
tell
us
we
are
not
his
for
a
moment
ernie
stood
silent
then
she
said
very
low
know
but
i
tell
at
that
instant
there
sounded
a
second
peal
at
the
bell
this
time
it
was
uncle
george
never
before
in
my
life
have
i
seen
him
so
upset
though
it
was
evident
he
tried
to
appear
indifferent
his
first
words
were
addressed
to
maria
home
to
your
mistress
my
good
girl
he
said
then
turning
to
mother
does
not
answer
to
send
servants
on
such
errands
they
simply
stand
and
mother
flushed
a
little
is
quite
blameless
she
replied
desired
to
hear
all
she
knew
in
regard
to
geoffrey
have
you
any
further
news
uncle
george
laid
his
hat
carefully
upon
a
chair
and
felt
in
his
coat
pocket
seems
the
young
scamp
left
a
note
he
said
in
a
voice
that
was
husky
despite
his
assumption
of
unconcern
was
not
in
his
room
or
we
would
have
found
it
earlier
he
gave
it
to
georgie
last
night
telling
him
to
give
it
to
me
this
morning
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
breakfast
in
the
and
uncle
george
handed
mother
a
folded
sheet
of
paper
we
read
was
looking
over
her
shoulder
find
that
i
shall
have
to
go
away
for
i
ment
what
i
said
wen
you
gave
me
my
money
tonight
it
would
be
beastly
to
go
to
that
and
i
cant
studdy
and
keep
things
up
in
the
way
that
is
expected
it
makes
my
headache
perhaps
there
is
something
the
matter
with
that
part
of
my
bran
wich
i
have
inherited
from
you
but
dont
worry
this
will
not
keep
me
from
being
a
good
bizness
man
wich
has
always
been
the
fate
i
have
most
wished
for
i
am
sorry
to
have
made
so
much
trubble
and
ill
come
back
some
day
dont
let
georgie
forget
me
and
dont
you
forget
me
either
loving
son
meadows
i
wanted
to
cry
as
i
read
it
poor
blundering
affectionate
geof
with
his
atrocious
spelling
and
his
mother
handed
the
note
to
uncle
george
again
without
a
word
he
asked
shortly
is
very
like
geoffrey
she
said
i
never
could
have
supposed
he
would
run
away
what
are
you
going
to
do
myself
returned
uncle
george
prefer
to
wait
and
give
the
young
beggar
a
chance
to
grow
tired
of
his
experiment
the
medicine
he
needs
a
chap
who
can
throw
over
a
good
home
such
as
geoffrey
has
ought
to
be
made
to
rough
it
a
bit
but
the
women
folk
hear
of
it
meta
and
her
mother
are
in
a
great
taking
they
imagine
all
sorts
of
foolishness
and
on
account
of
them
more
especially
that
i
have
come
over
to
interview
your
ernie
come
young
woman
what
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
do
you
know
anything
of
whereabouts
again
ernie
flushed
crimson
lowered
her
eyelids
and
remained
silent
have
already
questioned
ernestine
said
mother
undoubtedly
knows
certain
facts
which
would
be
very
useful
i
hope
that
i
shall
be
able
to
convince
her
it
is
her
duty
to
tell
uncle
george
looked
from
mother
to
ernie
in
blank
amazement
you
mean
to
say
she
tell
he
demanded
there
is
only
one
way
out
of
it
she
must
be
made
shall
try
to
show
ernie
that
it
is
the
only
way
in
which
she
can
be
of
any
help
to
geoffrey
answered
mother
quietly
uncle
george
frowned
impatiently
tell
you
what
he
said
after
a
thought
give
her
a
gold
piece
for
the
first
bit
of
information
she
has
to
give
us
more
make
it
dollars
if
it
leads
to
capture
before
night
what
do
you
say
to
that
my
girl
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
look
of
horror
depicted
in
features
betray
geof
her
dear
chum
her
more
than
brother
for
a
sordid
money
reward
if
uncle
george
had
only
known
it
our
last
chance
of
winning
ernie
was
lost
when
he
uttered
those
hateful
words
but
he
did
not
know
and
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
make
him
understand
on
the
contrary
he
picked
up
his
hat
with
a
satisfied
expression
of
having
set
things
on
the
right
track
at
last
and
after
a
final
injunction
keep
him
informed
left
us
mother
and
i
looked
hopelessly
at
one
another
as
the
front
door
closed
behind
him
dear
said
mother
very
gently
aside
all
thought
of
uncle
offer
for
of
course
it
is
out
of
the
question
that
you
should
accept
any
money
expect
you
to
tell
me
at
once
all
you
know
in
regard
to
plans
it
may
be
the
means
of
saving
him
great
hardship
and
ernie
i
urged
everybody
is
agreed
that
it
is
much
better
to
break
a
bad
promise
than
to
keep
it
your
own
tell
you
that
but
reason
command
entreat
as
we
might
ernie
remained
obdurate
she
sat
on
the
top
stair
leading
down
to
the
basement
the
big
tears
welling
in
her
blue
eyes
and
trickling
along
her
nose
till
they
dropped
from
the
tip
with
a
little
splash
into
her
lap
listening
plaintively
to
all
we
said
replying
nothing
moving
picture
of
stubborn
misery
at
last
mother
desisted
she
said
want
you
distinctly
to
understand
that
i
am
both
disappointed
and
displeased
with
you
you
are
the
one
person
who
can
be
of
any
help
to
geoffrey
but
i
shall
ask
you
no
further
questions
when
your
own
good
feeling
and
sense
of
right
prompt
you
to
follow
my
wishes
i
shall
be
ready
to
listen
to
then
mother
dressed
and
went
to
see
aunt
adelaide
i
ran
up
to
the
nursery
to
robin
and
ernie
locked
herself
in
the
workshop
where
she
set
to
work
painting
a
gorgeous
family
of
japanese
paper
dolls
for
mary
birthday
their
beflowered
kimonos
ever
and
again
with
a
salty
drop
she
was
very
forlorn
poor
darling
beyond
measure
to
feel
that
her
family
disapproved
of
her
yet
she
had
given
her
word
to
geof
so
the
morning
passed
lunch
time
came
and
still
there
was
no
news
the
afternoon
dragged
even
more
heavily
and
when
hazard
came
home
from
the
office
in
the
evening
he
told
us
that
uncle
george
had
three
detectives
looking
for
geof
but
as
yet
they
had
found
no
clue
dinner
was
somewhat
of
an
ordeal
i
had
the
head
of
the
table
as
mother
did
not
feel
she
could
leave
aunt
adelaide
who
is
in
a
very
apprehensive
and
nervous
state
we
tried
to
keep
the
conversation
to
general
topics
but
the
anecdotal
vein
of
the
boarders
was
not
to
be
stemmed
it
seems
that
escapade
reminded
everybody
of
some
incident
in
his
or
her
own
family
or
the
family
of
a
friend
or
even
a
friend
nothing
was
too
to
be
appropriate
every
possible
climax
to
the
adventure
was
predicted
and
the
same
heartening
conversation
continued
when
we
gathered
in
the
parlour
after
dinner
to
wait
for
news
till
finally
about
ten
or
so
the
boarders
began
to
disperse
to
their
rooms
not
before
lysle
had
made
a
brief
though
painful
effort
to
win
confidence
for
she
is
a
favourite
with
the
kind
and
it
grieved
him
to
know
her
in
disgrace
therefore
interrupting
his
sister
who
was
condoling
with
miss
brown
over
the
sad
fate
of
a
nephew
of
the
aunt
who
eloped
with
a
sea
daughter
some
sixty
years
ago
and
was
finally
eaten
up
by
whales
off
the
cape
of
good
hope
i
believe
it
was
thus
the
thrilling
story
ran
lysle
with
a
sly
wink
at
his
wife
over
the
top
of
his
newspaper
began
ernie
ahem
ernie
looked
up
from
her
and
the
continued
ponderously
suppose
you
are
familiar
with
the
famous
anecdote
of
george
washington
and
his
hatchet
how
when
still
a
young
boy
the
father
of
our
country
found
it
impossible
even
with
the
fear
of
stern
chastisement
before
him
to
tell
ernie
cautiously
refusing
to
commit
herself
to
any
previous
acquaintance
with
the
incident
lysle
continued
blandly
my
dear
child
a
similar
opportunity
is
presented
to
you
opportunity
such
as
you
may
never
meet
grand
opportunity
a
great
one
the
path
of
truth
is
a
path
of
roses
for
all
that
it
has
its
thorns
if
i
may
say
so
because
of
them
he
paused
impressively
and
looked
ernie
firmly
in
the
eye
we
the
audience
waited
breathless
but
still
lysle
did
not
speak
so
supposing
at
last
the
homily
must
be
concluded
we
were
about
to
return
to
our
various
avocations
when
he
positively
thundered
forth
is
your
cousin
geoffrey
where
is
that
wilful
lad
speak
i
command
you
everybody
in
the
room
jumped
and
miss
lysle
who
is
nervous
uttered
an
hysterical
little
squawk
like
a
frightened
hen
ernie
alone
remained
undaunted
the
poor
continued
to
gaze
at
her
triumph
fading
to
chagrin
till
finally
he
turned
to
his
wife
with
such
a
disappointed
air
thought
i
could
surprise
it
out
of
her
he
said
evidently
and
a
few
moments
later
he
bade
us
a
subdued
and
was
soon
followed
upstairs
by
the
rest
of
the
boarders
it
seems
too
strange
to
be
sitting
here
writing
these
things
with
no
idea
where
geoffrey
may
be
if
only
i
did
not
feel
my
own
responsibility
so
keenly
i
can
see
now
that
i
should
have
told
mother
last
tuesday
when
first
i
heard
of
there
is
the
bell
it
may
be
news
yes
and
good
news
too
geoffrey
is
found
he
was
brought
home
about
eleven
by
one
of
uncle
detectives
who
ran
across
him
in
a
little
cottage
in
elizabeth
where
he
had
spent
the
day
with
a
german
woman
who
was
once
a
cook
at
uncle
when
own
mother
was
alive
she
is
married
now
and
has
a
neat
little
home
of
her
own
with
three
fat
german
babies
there
geoffrey
arrived
late
last
night
and
morning
he
had
planned
to
set
out
again
on
his
travels
and
beat
his
way
to
south
dakota
where
prendergast
the
german
woman
has
a
brother
who
works
on
a
cattle
ranch
think
of
it
dear
little
ernie
broke
down
completely
when
she
heard
of
capture
she
threw
herself
into
arms
sobbing
convulsively
mean
to
be
naughty
mother
dear
i
and
of
course
you
know
i
had
given
my
word
you
see
and
then
uncle
george
might
have
me
take
that
hateful
money
oh
what
are
they
going
to
do
to
geoffrey
there
dear
said
mother
cry
so
it
is
all
over
now
and
as
to
geoffrey
you
need
not
worry
aunt
adelaide
and
uncle
george
are
only
too
anxious
to
forgive
him
he
has
acted
very
wrongly
and
given
us
all
a
great
fright
but
it
has
been
a
lesson
to
everybody
concerned
and
i
think
uncle
george
holds
geoffrey
entirely
and
later
after
ernie
had
snuggled
down
in
bed
where
she
dropped
at
once
into
an
exhausted
sleep
mother
confided
to
me
that
she
as
well
as
aunt
adelaide
fears
that
geoffrey
is
going
to
be
ill
he
seemed
quite
unlike
himself
this
and
almost
dazed
and
he
still
complained
of
headache
aunt
adelaide
sent
him
at
once
to
bed
and
this
morning
if
he
is
not
better
he
is
to
see
a
doctor
i
say
this
morning
because
it
is
already
nearly
two
my
eyes
are
sticky
with
sleep
i
can
not
write
another
word
except
to
add
that
even
if
geof
is
to
be
ill
we
are
all
thankful
tuesday
february
geoffrey
has
typhoid
fever
so
and
aunt
adelaide
were
right
oh
why
could
we
not
have
suspected
before
the
doctor
says
the
disease
has
been
coming
on
for
months
accounts
for
headaches
his
sleepless
nights
his
general
indifference
and
lassitude
and
we
know
too
now
that
he
never
would
have
tried
to
run
away
never
would
have
frightened
us
so
had
he
been
himself
how
hard
and
unsympathetic
we
must
have
seemed
these
last
weeks
for
he
was
sick
poor
dear
and
dazed
and
stupid
he
could
not
explain
and
we
would
not
understand
well
we
are
going
to
be
good
to
him
at
last
and
make
up
aunt
adelaide
all
of
us
says
ernie
with
an
anxious
little
frown
it
was
she
who
brought
the
news
this
morning
before
school
will
have
to
wait
a
while
i
guess
meta
says
miss
barron
the
trained
nurse
is
a
regular
tyrant
she
let
any
one
near
it
seems
that
meta
wanted
to
go
to
geoffrey
and
apologise
as
soon
as
she
heard
that
he
had
typhoid
the
memory
of
their
various
scraps
and
misunderstandings
troubled
her
she
made
quite
a
point
of
the
matter
till
miss
barron
said
it
was
out
of
the
question
then
meta
determined
she
would
slip
in
on
the
sly
she
is
very
wilful
once
she
gets
an
idea
into
her
head
so
she
watched
her
chance
stole
up
when
no
one
was
on
guard
got
as
far
as
the
door
and
peeped
in
the
room
was
quite
dark
head
was
swathed
in
towels
and
an
he
kept
turning
it
from
side
to
side
upon
the
pillow
his
eyes
were
staring
open
and
he
was
muttering
to
himself
in
an
odd
hoarse
voice
suddenly
he
caught
sight
of
meta
who
was
advancing
on
into
the
room
started
up
on
his
elbow
and
shouted
she
turned
and
ran
poor
thing
right
into
uncle
george
who
was
coming
upstairs
with
the
doctor
and
he
scolded
her
and
sent
her
to
her
room
i
am
afraid
geof
is
going
to
be
very
porter
who
called
to
see
robin
this
afternoon
was
extremely
uncommunicative
is
impossible
to
predict
at
this
stage
was
all
we
could
get
him
to
say
the
boy
has
a
good
wednesday
february
geof
no
better
oh
how
can
we
endure
this
suspense
sunday
march
geoffrey
desperately
ill
he
is
delirious
the
greater
part
of
the
time
or
lies
in
a
heavy
stupour
poor
little
ernie
who
goes
every
day
for
news
crept
up
to
his
door
yesterday
morning
crouched
outside
and
listened
geof
was
singing
in
a
queer
hoarse
voice
years
on
when
afar
and
asunder
parted
are
those
who
are
singing
when
you
look
back
and
forgetfully
wonder
what
you
were
like
in
your
work
and
your
play
followed
by
snatches
of
the
eton
boating
song
then
he
would
break
off
to
shout
football
signals
and
tackle
over
fellows
there
what
are
you
trying
for
a
bluff
you
remember
told
you
it
interspersed
with
muttered
snatches
of
german
and
latin
paradigms
oh
mourned
ernie
pathetically
done
dear
geof
a
great
injustice
elizabeth
amazing
all
that
boy
knows
he
repeated
lines
and
lines
of
cæsar
only
wish
haze
could
have
heard
him
strings
of
irregular
french
verbs
and
then
began
to
say
the
capitals
of
the
states
and
exports
and
imports
it
was
simply
wonderful
i
felt
so
proud
but
mother
and
i
are
frightened
geof
never
would
have
known
such
things
in
his
right
mind
we
feel
sure
and
we
suspect
that
porter
fears
cerebral
complications
a
consultation
was
held
yesterday
and
a
second
nurse
has
been
engaged
to
relieve
miss
barron
monday
march
the
fever
has
still
three
weeks
to
run
it
does
not
seem
as
if
geof
could
hold
out
ernie
has
grown
so
pale
and
still
these
last
few
days
mother
and
i
are
really
anxious
about
her
wednesday
march
i
am
desperate
i
bear
it
i
we
have
just
been
told
that
our
precious
robin
must
undergo
an
operation
we
have
enough
to
endure
without
this
geoffrey
so
ill
past
the
crisis
yet
now
bobsie
my
own
baby
whom
i
love
better
than
anything
in
all
the
world
god
is
cruel
oh
i
know
what
i
am
writing
i
must
calm
myself
this
afternoon
after
hearing
about
robin
and
trying
to
write
and
giving
it
up
i
put
on
my
hat
and
jacket
and
escaped
alone
to
the
park
i
walked
fast
and
just
at
first
i
did
not
notice
anything
bare
branches
of
the
trees
against
the
early
sunset
sky
the
patches
of
melting
snow
about
the
rhododendron
bushes
the
children
playing
with
their
nurses
on
the
common
one
little
fellow
with
rosy
cheeks
and
shining
eyes
came
running
laughing
and
shouting
over
his
shoulder
and
stumbled
against
me
me
he
piped
and
shied
off
again
it
was
like
a
knife
in
my
heart
i
wondered
stupidly
why
it
should
hurt
so
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
to
think
then
i
knew
it
was
because
robin
had
never
run
like
that
oh
he
has
missed
so
much
in
his
little
life
i
remember
perfectly
first
birthday
how
i
woke
with
a
start
before
it
was
yet
light
and
saw
the
morning
star
big
and
beautiful
shining
in
at
my
window
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
clasped
my
knees
and
blinked
at
it
of
an
unusual
stir
in
the
house
till
all
at
once
there
rose
a
little
cry
how
my
heart
beat
i
jumped
out
of
bed
slipped
on
my
dressing
gown
and
slippers
and
crept
down
the
stairs
to
door
where
i
crouched
against
the
wall
and
listened
a
few
moments
later
the
door
opened
and
parsons
the
nurse
poked
her
head
out
my
soul
she
said
almost
thought
you
was
a
ghost
my
dear
run
down
to
the
library
like
a
good
girl
and
tell
your
pa
that
everything
is
all
right
it
is
a
fine
little
boy
and
your
mamma
is
doing
nurse
i
breathed
i
see
the
baby
first
be
sure
you
might
answered
parsons
and
she
went
back
into
the
room
and
returned
again
with
a
little
white
flannel
bundle
which
she
laid
in
my
arms
and
i
put
back
a
corner
of
the
blanket
and
peeped
in
and
there
was
robin
smiling
up
at
me
his
eyes
were
big
and
dark
just
as
they
are
and
he
blinked
them
everybody
says
it
is
impossible
that
robin
should
have
smiled
but
i
saw
him
and
i
know
so
the
next
morning
i
put
away
my
dolls
and
never
played
with
them
again
it
would
have
been
too
stupid
with
a
real
baby
to
mother
and
dress
and
sing
to
crying
chirped
a
little
voice
for
i
was
thinking
of
these
things
as
i
sat
on
the
bench
in
the
park
and
sure
enough
the
tears
were
on
my
face
and
i
looked
up
to
find
three
chubby
tots
standing
hand
in
hand
before
me
staring
in
a
solemn
row
so
then
i
got
up
and
came
home
again
since
i
did
not
care
to
make
a
public
spectacle
of
myself
mother
met
me
on
the
doorstep
with
outstretched
hands
and
her
own
brave
smile
darling
she
said
meant
to
spare
you
but
i
am
afraid
it
has
come
as
too
much
of
a
shock
come
into
the
parlour
we
will
have
a
cup
of
and
when
i
was
tucked
snugly
on
the
lounge
and
had
wept
my
little
weep
where
no
one
could
see
talked
it
all
out
together
what
comfortable
institutions
mothers
are
it
seems
that
if
robin
does
not
have
the
operation
now
he
can
never
have
it
a
few
months
later
would
be
too
late
and
though
porter
had
hoped
to
obviate
the
necessity
by
a
long
rest
in
bed
everything
else
has
failed
there
remains
this
one
chance
we
must
be
brave
for
our
baby
elizabeth
explained
mother
is
too
young
to
make
the
decision
for
himself
the
doctor
spoke
to
me
of
the
matter
first
before
christmas
i
would
not
tell
you
then
dear
since
there
seemed
a
chance
of
escape
and
we
had
worries
enough
without
adding
anything
else
but
that
was
why
i
was
so
determined
not
to
draw
from
our
little
stock
of
money
helped
me
there
think
how
thankful
we
should
be
that
we
do
not
have
to
borrow
that
we
can
engage
a
nurse
for
robin
that
is
necessary
he
need
not
even
be
moved
to
a
hospital
porter
says
it
will
all
be
over
in
a
couple
of
weeks
and
whatever
the
result
there
will
be
the
inexpressible
comfort
of
knowing
that
everything
possible
has
been
tried
are
you
satisfied
do
you
blame
me
no
indeed
i
answered
think
i
hate
the
doctor
elizabeth
smiled
mother
as
she
took
my
empty
and
put
it
upon
the
table
now
i
want
you
to
run
up
to
your
room
bathe
your
face
and
put
on
a
pretty
frock
burroughs
has
sent
over
a
charming
mould
of
orange
jelly
and
some
for
robin
there
is
to
be
a
in
the
nursery
and
you
and
abraham
lincoln
are
invited
what
do
you
think
of
that
it
was
one
of
dear
considerate
schemes
to
save
my
eyes
from
a
downstairs
dinner
so
i
kissed
her
sped
up
to
my
room
dabbed
a
little
powder
on
the
tip
of
my
nose
and
donned
my
dress
invitation
should
be
honoured
with
the
best
i
had
how
his
black
eyes
danced
when
i
entered
to
him
in
all
my
finery
me
the
honour
of
presenting
my
friend
abraham
lincoln
he
piped
the
globe
elizabeth
on
the
side
of
the
bed
you
must
pertend
to
shake
hands
and
we
can
get
him
to
eat
a
little
so
i
pretended
to
shake
hands
with
the
abraham
lincoln
and
tempted
him
with
and
orange
jelly
both
of
which
delicacies
he
obstinately
refused
mind
says
robin
know
good
will
eat
such
a
jolly
party
as
it
was
we
told
stories
guessed
riddles
and
ran
races
to
see
who
could
dispose
of
the
most
sandwiches
till
even
the
kind
could
not
have
complained
of
appetite
but
at
last
he
grew
tired
and
the
weary
pain
returned
away
the
party
please
and
sing
to
me
ellie
dear
he
said
so
i
carried
the
tray
outside
and
came
back
and
sat
down
by
the
bed
and
with
thin
little
hand
in
mine
sang
to
him
the
dear
familiar
that
we
have
both
come
to
love
so
well
and
bobsie
cuddled
up
against
my
arm
and
closed
his
eyes
and
sighed
and
then
somehow
i
knew
that
if
he
is
not
to
grow
up
strong
and
straight
like
other
boys
if
he
is
to
suffer
more
and
more
as
the
years
go
by
it
would
be
cruel
to
want
to
keep
robin
and
oh
i
went
on
singing
and
my
voice
did
not
once
break
or
trail
so
perhaps
god
will
forgive
the
wicked
words
i
wrote
when
i
was
so
wild
i
believe
i
can
be
brave
now
because
after
a
bit
bobsie
dropped
asleep
with
his
hand
still
in
mine
think
before
i
left
him
that
i
said
sunday
march
it
is
over
all
yesterday
morning
ernie
and
i
sat
on
the
attic
stairs
holding
each
hands
and
trying
to
feel
hopeful
had
such
a
pretty
colour
in
his
cheeks
last
evening
said
ernie
he
did
enjoy
looking
out
the
window
buster
was
there
and
john
waved
his
hand
before
they
went
away
it
was
a
good
sign
that
the
doctor
should
have
let
him
up
in
his
chair
for
half
an
hour
you
think
so
elizabeth
robin
has
a
lot
of
i
know
he
has
i
agreed
if
the
operation
does
go
well
splendid
it
will
be
one
never
thinks
of
bobsie
running
about
like
other
boys
continued
ernie
to
school
and
playing
marbles
and
doing
errands
i
hardly
realise
can
i
i
answered
and
for
a
while
there
was
silence
between
us
then
ernie
began
again
good
everybody
has
been
uncle
george
even
offered
to
pay
for
the
operation
glad
we
have
to
accept
though
we
ought
to
be
very
thankful
too
elizabeth
about
the
boarders
the
oatmeal
was
burned
this
morning
you
notice
they
never
said
just
think
if
hudson
had
been
here
know
it
i
answered
ernie
if
robin
and
geof
pull
through
there
is
not
another
thing
in
the
world
we
could
dare
to
ask
for
prayed
and
prayed
returned
ernie
simply
i
saw
miss
barron
yesterday
and
she
says
that
geof
is
holding
his
then
for
a
long
time
we
were
quiet
each
thinking
her
own
thoughts
it
seemed
as
the
morning
would
never
go
feeling
anything
at
all
said
ernie
at
last
porter
promised
that
it
was
to
take
about
an
hour
elizabeth
only
of
course
there
would
be
a
great
deal
to
get
ready
first
i
must
see
what
time
it
is
it
seems
as
if
we
had
been
sitting
here
weeks
and
ernie
opened
the
hall
door
and
stole
out
into
the
light
blinking
like
a
little
owl
a
moment
more
and
she
was
back
white
and
scared
smells
so
of
chloroform
she
confessed
quite
reach
the
so
then
we
shut
the
door
again
and
waited
a
long
long
while
till
at
last
we
heard
mother
call
ernestine
i
sat
quite
still
but
ernie
ran
down
and
threw
back
the
door
are
here
mother
dear
on
the
attic
my
poor
lambs
said
mother
with
a
little
catch
in
her
voice
you
have
found
a
more
comfortable
place
to
wait
but
it
is
over
now
porter
declares
the
operation
a
complete
success
and
robin
has
come
out
from
the
anæsthetic
beautifully
gasped
ernie
and
then
with
a
quick
little
cry
i
see
why
she
should
be
calling
me
when
i
was
right
there
sitting
on
the
top
step
looking
down
at
her
till
the
next
thing
i
knew
they
had
me
on
the
attic
floor
a
pungent
scent
of
ammonia
at
my
nose
while
ernie
poured
cold
water
down
my
neck
in
a
vain
attempt
to
get
me
to
swallow
and
mother
relieved
me
of
my
away
i
murmured
crossly
am
only
do
it
with
your
eyes
open
commanded
ernie
used
to
fainters
in
this
family
think
she
is
all
right
now
said
mother
will
get
her
into
the
workshop
to
so
there
despite
all
my
protestations
they
put
me
and
after
a
while
the
doctor
came
up
and
gave
me
some
medicine
in
a
glass
it
was
very
mortifying
but
he
said
i
could
not
help
it
and
perhaps
if
i
had
not
made
up
my
mind
to
expect
the
worst
i
should
have
borne
the
news
better
and
next
if
you
please
i
went
to
sleep
was
that
medicine
tell
me
never
woke
till
evening
when
dear
haze
brought
up
a
tray
and
sat
beside
me
while
i
ate
some
chicken
broth
is
doing
splendidly
he
said
course
we
have
none
of
us
seen
him
yet
except
mother
and
elizabeth
faint
a
good
girl
geof
has
passed
the
crisis
they
telephoned
uncle
george
at
noon
the
office
had
a
i
came
home
heard
the
good
news
about
robin
and
then
went
shopping
hazey
i
repeated
for
it
seemed
rather
an
odd
way
for
him
to
spend
his
afternoon
returned
hazard
to
see
what
i
got
and
with
a
somewhat
conscious
smile
he
sidled
toward
the
workshop
door
a
moment
later
and
he
was
back
bearing
a
package
the
wrappings
being
quickly
removed
revealed
a
beautiful
clement
braun
print
of
the
sistine
madonna
finished
in
soft
sepia
tints
and
set
off
by
a
charmingly
tasteful
frame
hazard
i
cried
lovely
is
it
for
robin
no
is
hardly
old
enough
you
must
have
bought
it
for
i
then
contradicted
haze
just
for
you
my
dear
you
see
i
had
planned
to
get
something
like
this
at
christmas
but
i
lost
my
money
and
and
you
stood
by
me
like
a
trump
while
all
the
rest
of
the
world
thought
i
was
pretty
much
of
an
ass
hesitate
to
say
so
occasionally
sometimes
i
have
been
afraid
you
know
that
i
appreciate
what
a
splendid
chum
you
are
elizabeth
so
i
determined
to
find
some
way
to
show
you
and
as
soon
as
i
began
to
draw
my
salary
again
i
thought
of
this
an
easter
present
i
wanted
you
to
have
it
dear
i
cried
haze
always
wanted
this
madonna
but
it
must
have
cost
a
lot
you
have
given
mother
two
dollars
every
single
week
how
did
you
ever
manage
hazey
blushed
beamfully
all
right
he
answered
with
becoming
modesty
glad
you
like
and
looking
up
i
noticed
again
what
mother
and
i
were
commenting
upon
only
the
other
day
i
accused
are
thin
you
have
been
saving
from
your
lunches
deny
it
used
to
short
rations
admitted
hazard
anything
at
all
elizabeth
but
it
happen
again
because
now
faint
a
dear
been
promoted
and
am
to
get
five
dollars
a
week
from
now
on
it
all
comes
from
my
head
for
figures
you
see
been
helping
simpkins
lately
senior
accountant
he
was
pretty
well
satisfied
with
my
work
so
when
bridges
spoke
of
taking
me
back
into
the
outside
office
what
should
the
old
man
do
but
go
direct
to
uncle
george
with
the
matter
and
say
he
get
along
without
me
uncle
george
was
very
much
pleased
i
really
think
so
to
have
what
is
practically
a
junior
position
my
official
title
is
only
boy
a
increase
in
salary
rather
a
pretty
turn
of
luck
hey
you
helped
turn
it
haze
darling
i
answered
earned
it
every
bit
you
have
worked
well
and
faithfully
at
things
you
hated
without
any
hope
of
reward
oh
proud
of
you
all
are
and
just
at
that
moment
mother
and
ernie
came
up
and
helped
me
congratulate
him
after
a
bit
when
we
had
discussed
the
news
from
every
possible
point
of
view
we
all
went
down
to
hang
the
picture
and
ernie
and
haze
insisted
upon
supporting
me
tenderly
one
on
either
hand
which
was
ridiculous
and
before
i
went
to
bed
they
let
me
in
to
kiss
robin
and
now
it
is
morning
i
am
sitting
at
my
desk
writing
with
oh
such
a
thankful
heart
while
above
me
on
the
wall
hangs
most
beautiful
madonna
quite
glorifying
and
illuminating
this
shabby
little
room
sunday
april
spring
has
come
at
last
with
easter
such
a
beautiful
blue
sky
as
we
woke
to
this
morning
such
tender
breaths
of
gusty
air
seems
funny
to
be
putting
on
winter
hat
remarked
ernie
cheerfully
as
she
picked
up
her
shabby
gray
beaver
and
shook
out
its
matted
pompon
while
i
sniffed
suspiciously
at
my
white
gloves
in
the
window
wondering
if
they
really
did
whiff
faintly
of
gasoline
i
admitted
me
that
please
everybody
will
be
wearing
new
clothes
but
us
and
we
got
any
do
you
care
should
think
myself
pretty
mean
if
i
did
returned
ernie
roundly
on
elizabeth
the
bells
are
ringing
we
have
barely
time
to
say
to
the
nursery
windows
were
open
the
sunshine
fell
in
bright
patches
across
little
white
crib
where
he
lay
among
his
pillows
literally
embowered
amid
blossoming
plants
elizabeth
he
called
another
crimson
bramble
rose
it
any
card
just
a
happy
easter
one
mother
guess
who
sent
it
so
i
think
it
was
that
makes
five
flowers
and
two
rabbits
and
three
chickens
and
a
little
red
all
for
me
a
pansy
for
you
and
ernie
please
you
want
to
look
pretty
easter
you
honey
we
answered
and
though
the
stems
were
very
short
we
managed
to
pin
pansies
into
our
coats
are
playing
happy
morning
said
ernestine
as
the
front
door
closed
behind
us
and
the
jubilant
music
of
the
chimes
rang
more
clearly
to
our
ears
elizabeth
we
happy
we
we
are
ernie
dear
i
returned
and
then
we
had
to
hurry
since
it
was
already
late
there
are
aunt
adelaide
and
meta
i
cried
presently
as
we
neared
the
church
porch
are
going
in
just
ahead
of
us
how
stunningly
they
are
gotten
up
suit
is
charming
and
what
a
love
of
a
hat
we
look
nice
too
returned
ernie
with
an
irrepressible
little
skip
and
a
downward
glance
at
the
bright
flower
in
her
help
it
elizabeth
we
are
the
swelling
notes
of
the
organ
the
youthful
soaring
voices
of
the
choristers
in
exultant
anthem
and
hymn
the
collect
and
short
strong
sermon
seemed
all
a
wonderful
expression
of
our
own
inward
thanksgiving
and
gratitude
never
before
has
an
easter
service
meant
so
much
to
me
and
i
know
it
was
the
same
with
ernie
our
shabby
gloves
met
in
sympathetic
clasp
we
squeezed
one
hands
and
thought
of
that
other
morning
when
we
sat
side
by
side
on
the
dark
attic
stairs
waiting
for
news
of
robin
oh
to
have
made
up
mind
to
renunciation
only
to
have
treasure
given
back
for
we
have
great
hopes
of
bobsie
now
porter
is
more
than
satisfied
with
the
progress
he
is
making
and
only
listen
more
good
news
to
tell
for
after
service
aunt
adelaide
and
meta
waited
for
us
in
the
and
we
walked
a
couple
of
blocks
together
is
very
anxious
to
see
you
ernie
said
aunt
adelaide
you
manage
to
get
around
for
a
little
visit
this
afternoon
porter
has
given
his
cried
ernie
with
an
ecstatic
little
prance
i
truly
come
the
one
thing
needed
to
make
the
day
perfect
your
mamma
to
come
with
you
smiled
aunt
adelaide
the
old
breach
seems
really
healed
at
last
our
mutual
anxiety
over
geof
and
robin
has
brought
us
closer
together
than
anything
else
could
ever
have
done
her
please
that
there
is
a
little
matter
uncle
george
and
i
want
to
talk
over
with
certainly
i
will
returned
ernie
while
meta
asked
with
a
glance
at
the
posy
in
my
robin
get
many
flowers
for
easter
he
did
i
returned
pot
of
pansies
a
lily
a
purple
hyacinth
and
a
beautiful
crimson
rambler
it
is
one
mass
of
bloom
it
came
just
before
church
and
there
was
no
card
so
we
have
been
guessing
ever
meta
nodded
her
head
in
a
satisfied
way
and
geof
ought
to
have
something
pretty
she
said
have
been
sick
so
long
and
it
must
be
horrid
to
lie
in
bed
with
nothing
but
the
wallpaper
to
look
at
i
think
rather
nice
to
send
easter
cards
with
easter
flowers
instead
of
your
name
you
then
we
separated
and
i
thought
no
more
of
remark
but
this
afternoon
when
ernie
stole
on
tiptoe
into
room
the
first
thing
she
noticed
after
the
patient
of
course
was
a
second
crimson
rambler
rose
the
exact
duplicate
of
did
it
come
from
geof
asked
ernie
hoping
to
clear
up
the
mystery
of
plant
there
any
card
no
answered
geof
his
poor
hands
were
those
of
a
skeleton
his
voice
was
a
whisper
his
eyes
seemed
the
only
living
thing
left
when
ernie
looked
at
him
she
wanted
to
kiss
him
and
cry
that
would
not
have
been
cheering
so
she
asked
about
the
crimson
rambler
instead
came
this
morning
just
before
church
meta
brought
it
up
there
any
visiting
card
but
there
was
this
easter
affair
with
the
moulting
angel
i
told
meta
make
a
big
mistake
if
he
tried
to
fly
with
wings
and
she
seem
to
like
it
much
though
she
said
was
undoubtedly
an
authority
on
the
subject
the
first
remark
made
to
me
since
been
sick
added
geof
with
a
weak
little
chuckle
rather
think
i
liked
says
ernie
in
a
burst
of
really
unusual
perspicacity
wonder
meta
enjoy
your
criticism
willing
to
bet
my
hat
the
old
one
with
the
frozen
pompon
you
know
that
she
alone
is
responsible
for
the
angel
and
the
rose
too
robin
received
duplicates
this
morning
just
about
the
same
time
only
his
angel
has
a
drum
instead
of
a
trumpet
and
from
something
meta
said
to
elizabeth
i
am
almost
sure
that
she
chose
them
pale
cheeks
flushed
and
he
lay
quiet
for
a
moment
never
suspected
it
he
said
at
last
i
guess
perhaps
right
certainly
meta
has
been
treating
me
pretty
white
lately
and
the
mater
too
i
wonder
a
bit
bunnie
if
things
were
going
to
be
meantime
mother
aunt
adelaide
and
uncle
george
were
holding
an
equally
interesting
conversation
in
the
library
downstairs
it
seems
that
porter
wants
geof
to
go
away
for
a
couple
of
weeks
and
he
also
remarked
in
an
apparently
casual
aside
though
we
are
tempted
to
suspect
it
was
premeditated
that
a
change
would
be
an
excellent
thing
for
robin
but
that
he
did
not
feel
at
liberty
to
prescribe
it
when
he
thought
of
the
heavy
expenses
we
had
been
under
for
the
operation
the
two
remarks
worked
together
in
aunt
mind
perhaps
they
were
intended
to
do
the
result
is
that
she
has
asked
mother
to
take
geof
and
robin
too
to
atlantic
city
for
a
fortnight
with
maria
to
help
care
for
them
and
uncle
george
to
foot
the
bills
and
mother
did
not
hesitate
to
accept
since
aunt
adelaide
stated
quite
frankly
that
the
obligation
will
be
mutual
she
does
not
want
to
leave
the
city
just
at
present
and
she
quite
shrinks
from
the
responsibility
of
overseeing
convalescence
could
anything
be
more
splendid
just
think
of
our
dear
little
bobsie
enjoying
a
holiday
by
the
sea
fat
and
rosy
playing
about
on
the
beach
picking
up
but
that
reminds
me
i
must
interrupt
my
jubilations
to
tell
of
the
sad
end
of
abraham
lincoln
ernie
and
i
have
suspected
for
a
couple
of
days
past
that
all
was
not
well
in
the
little
glass
globe
since
thursday
has
refused
to
snatch
at
a
straw
no
matter
how
persistently
he
has
been
yesterday
opened
his
mouth
as
bobsie
explained
and
he
has
not
closed
it
since
this
afternoon
when
i
was
talking
to
robin
about
his
little
red
i
had
just
rescued
from
forming
a
tent
for
one
of
the
white
mice
olfactory
organ
began
to
misgive
me
like
your
other
books
bobsie
dear
i
was
explaining
must
never
use
it
to
play
with
or
be
careless
of
it
you
may
keep
it
under
your
pillow
with
your
handkerchief
if
you
want
and
when
you
are
older
and
can
understand
better
you
will
find
it
full
of
the
most
comfortable
words
whatever
your
sorrow
you
will
always
find
something
to
help
but
bless
me
what
a
smell
where
it
come
from
lincoln
answered
robin
in
solemn
accents
it
does
i
returned
sniffing
suspiciously
into
the
little
globe
will
never
do
bobs
stark
dead
child
i
must
take
it
down
and
throw
it
into
the
howled
bobsie
in
a
sudden
outburst
of
uncontrollable
woe
maybe
he
was
sick
so
i
gave
him
some
of
my
medicine
and
a
teaspoonful
of
beef
tea
you
throw
him
into
the
elizabeth
been
too
i
tell
you
what
is
to
be
done
about
it
then
dear
i
asked
for
such
violence
of
anguish
was
unusual
on
the
part
of
robin
keep
him
here
any
longer
you
can
see
that
for
have
a
nice
little
funeral
sniffed
robin
pathetically
him
beneath
the
crimson
bramble
rose
and
you
can
read
some
of
the
words
out
of
my
little
red
bobsie
i
remonstrated
written
about
i
think
there
is
anything
said
i
would
always
something
to
me
sobbed
bobsie
now
when
i
need
it
most
even
look
what
was
to
be
done
faith
was
really
touching
i
could
not
bear
to
disappoint
him
if
it
could
be
helped
honey
i
said
at
last
cry
any
more
we
will
bury
abraham
lincoln
under
the
crimson
bramble
rose
come
shall
dig
the
grave
with
this
silver
teaspoon
and
then
if
there
is
anything
about
clams
in
the
read
it
to
so
abraham
lincoln
was
neatly
interred
and
as
robin
patted
down
the
earth
with
the
bowl
of
his
silver
spoon
i
began
in
a
grave
voice
from
the
benedicite
ye
whales
and
all
that
move
in
the
waters
bless
ye
the
lord
praise
him
and
magnify
him
for
it
was
the
best
i
could
do
after
a
vain
flutter
of
pages
and
though
a
clam
exactly
the
same
as
a
whale
robin
was
more
than
satisfied
did
i
tell
you
he
asked
knew
be
something
if
only
you
would
look
and
i
abraham
lincoln
elizabeth
when
he
came
from
the
at
christmas
to
this
little
later
when
i
told
ernie
of
the
tragedy
she
took
it
almost
as
seriously
as
robin
course
we
had
to
expect
that
he
would
die
sometime
she
admitted
with
a
little
sigh
glad
he
waited
till
we
had
the
crimson
rambler
under
which
to
bury
him
it
must
have
been
a
great
comfort
to
bobsie
abraham
lincoln
was
always
such
a
saturday
april
the
most
wonderful
thing
has
happened
i
shall
be
able
to
fill
the
last
two
pages
of
my
diary
with
such
news
all
because
ernie
and
i
determined
to
clean
house
absurd
to
miss
them
so
said
ernie
as
she
set
books
straight
in
the
nursery
yesterday
afternoon
somehow
i
get
used
to
seeing
this
room
so
tidy
how
queer
it
is
not
having
any
trays
to
carry
i
answered
and
bobs
have
never
been
away
from
us
before
i
wonder
if
there
will
be
another
letter
this
writes
such
lovely
letters
and
postscripts
are
so
funny
chuckled
ernie
with
a
slap
at
the
front
of
her
sailor
blouse
where
the
last
family
epistle
reposed
robin
refusing
and
telling
the
head
waiter
all
about
abraham
lincoln
in
the
hotel
i
shall
be
glad
when
they
are
home
again
i
admitted
that
sounds
selfish
since
the
change
is
doing
them
so
much
good
but
i
help
feeling
lonely
when
you
are
at
school
you
think
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
little
surprise
for
mother
asked
ernestine
useful
that
would
save
her
work
or
trouble
after
she
comes
back
tell
you
what
we
clean
house
you
and
rose
and
i
could
do
it
perfectly
well
and
this
place
had
a
good
raking
out
in
ages
rather
a
sensible
idea
i
agreed
now
when
the
family
is
so
small
we
could
manage
the
attic
the
basement
and
the
parlour
floor
perhaps
but
we
disturb
the
boarders
have
you
noticed
ernie
that
the
lysles
have
been
receiving
summer
resort
pamphlets
in
almost
every
mail
this
week
i
am
afraid
it
means
they
are
planning
to
leave
the
city
early
miss
brown
told
me
monday
that
she
had
an
invitation
to
spend
july
and
august
with
her
nieces
in
the
adirondacks
i
try
not
to
worry
but
we
have
drawn
our
last
money
from
the
bank
and
oh
i
do
dread
the
summer
think
about
it
then
returned
ernie
stoutly
weathered
a
good
many
storms
honey
and
it
would
be
pretty
ungrateful
for
us
to
fret
perhaps
something
will
turn
up
at
the
last
moment
i
wish
we
were
going
to
the
country
too
she
added
with
an
inconsistent
little
sigh
has
never
seen
a
clover
field
i
answered
a
live
cow
and
i
tasted
buttermilk
since
i
was
seven
years
old
just
think
the
woods
are
full
of
violets
this
very
minute
thrushes
and
bluebirds
know
it
returned
ernie
glancing
pensively
out
the
window
at
the
battered
row
of
that
lined
our
dusty
street
wish
we
could
rent
this
old
house
she
added
vindictively
go
away
and
start
a
chicken
farm
tired
of
boarders
elizabeth
when
they
are
as
kind
and
considerate
as
miss
brown
and
the
hippo
family
be
as
tired
of
them
as
i
am
i
answered
you
have
to
order
their
meals
but
we
would
need
the
front
stoop
browned
over
and
the
cellar
concreted
before
we
could
dream
of
letting
and
such
things
cost
money
it
just
seems
as
if
our
hands
were
prevent
them
from
wielding
a
broom
exclaimed
ernie
springing
up
with
an
energetic
shake
of
her
short
skirts
on
child
ashamed
of
us
a
little
hard
work
is
the
medicine
we
need
the
idea
of
sitting
here
in
opposite
at
one
another
like
a
pair
of
discontented
grannies
when
robin
and
geof
are
growing
fat
in
atlantic
city
and
mother
is
having
a
really
truly
holiday
for
the
first
time
in
years
going
up
to
begin
on
the
attic
this
instant
and
if
we
have
to
feel
blue
in
june
nearly
two
months
off
four
ernie
i
protested
you
think
we
had
better
put
off
the
till
i
returned
ernie
impetuously
is
a
pile
of
magazines
in
the
workshop
that
been
looked
over
since
the
year
tecpatl
mother
told
me
weeks
ago
that
she
wanted
them
sent
to
the
philippines
she
asked
me
to
go
through
them
then
so
come
well
i
answered
meekly
and
a
few
moments
later
ernie
and
i
were
seated
on
the
workshop
floor
each
with
our
separate
bunch
of
dusty
literature
that
nice
story
about
the
rogue
elephant
began
ernie
comfortably
think
we
can
let
that
go
and
oh
the
copy
of
with
magic
do
you
remember
we
read
it
aloud
one
christmas
it
is
about
the
two
little
boys
who
went
to
the
thought
returned
i
severely
we
came
up
here
to
get
these
magazines
ready
to
send
to
the
philippines
we
did
mumbled
ernie
if
we
go
through
them
how
are
we
to
know
which
ones
we
ought
to
send
at
that
moment
i
came
upon
an
odd
instalment
of
a
thrilling
historical
romance
that
had
haunted
my
memory
for
years
course
i
agreed
with
suspicious
alacrity
and
after
that
we
sat
together
on
the
workshop
floor
and
read
and
read
till
the
shadows
began
to
steal
out
from
the
corners
the
room
grew
dusk
and
gloomy
and
i
looked
up
with
straining
eyes
to
remark
it
is
simply
provoking
why
will
editors
always
break
off
at
the
most
exciting
spot
the
indians
are
attacking
the
blockhouse
i
find
the
next
instalment
rang
the
shrill
whoop
hurrah
for
a
moment
i
glared
about
me
in
terror
was
i
in
the
workshop
or
the
canadian
backwoods
was
the
wildly
whirling
figure
that
pranced
and
capered
about
me
now
advancing
now
retreating
my
own
little
sister
ernie
or
a
bloodthirsty
iroquois
savage
found
it
found
it
shrilled
the
jubilant
song
all
my
hunts
elizabeth
in
the
under
bed
to
think
we
sent
it
to
manila
are
you
talking
about
ernestine
i
demanded
severely
matter
what
you
have
found
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
shout
so
you
know
that
miss
brown
has
a
headache
and
besides
i
quite
mistook
you
for
an
indian
ernie
dropped
down
beside
me
and
flung
her
arms
about
my
neck
she
breathed
the
contract
at
last
stuck
between
the
pages
of
an
old
copy
of
engineering
and
to
think
we
almost
sent
it
so
i
understood
the
room
began
to
swim
about
me
my
head
sank
limply
to
supporting
shoulder
illustration
i
stood
in
the
kitchen
doorway
and
listened
you
dare
go
and
faint
on
me
threatened
that
unsympathetic
young
person
you
do
spill
water
over
your
new
rosebud
stock
i
mean
it
elizabeth
i
retorted
and
sat
up
clutching
my
precious
embroidered
collar
with
one
hand
while
i
extended
the
other
for
the
contract
ernie
picked
up
the
magazine
which
she
had
dropped
in
the
window
when
she
began
her
wild
and
extracted
a
document
it
is
she
said
it
was
by
the
merest
chance
i
found
it
i
knew
there
would
be
nothing
in
to
interest
us
though
some
stray
engineer
in
manila
might
like
it
and
i
was
just
about
to
put
it
with
these
other
magazines
we
want
i
noticed
the
date
and
that
made
me
think
of
dear
father
so
i
opened
it
just
to
see
what
he
had
been
reading
and
the
first
thing
i
came
on
was
the
contract
oh
elizabeth
he
must
have
slipped
it
in
here
on
his
way
home
from
office
that
very
afternoon
how
natural
it
seems
and
rose
cleared
it
away
later
and
we
never
suspected
by
this
time
ernie
and
i
were
reading
the
document
through
our
heads
close
together
in
the
window
our
hearts
thumping
despite
the
legal
verbiage
which
we
did
not
altogether
understand
despite
the
light
there
could
be
no
doubt
the
contract
was
found
it
was
also
dated
witnessed
and
signed
with
a
pathetic
little
blot
of
ink
under
the
dear
familiar
g
stem
in
name
at
first
we
could
hardly
believe
our
good
fortune
per
cent
of
whatever
profits
the
invention
is
making
gasped
ernie
perhaps
some
back
money
too
oh
elizabeth
the
boarders
can
leave
whenever
they
like
now
the
quicker
the
can
shut
up
this
house
and
go
away
to
the
country
robin
shall
play
in
the
clover
fields
you
shall
drink
buttermilk
and
will
start
a
chicken
farm
what
a
lovely
surprise
for
mother
and
she
threw
her
arms
about
my
neck
and
for
a
while
we
wept
and
laughed
together
to
think
how
ungrateful
we
were
this
very
afternoon
it
makes
one
rather
ashamed
it
dear
i
concluded
with
a
penitent
sniff
and
i
will
go
and
see
uncle
george
this
evening
he
will
advise
what
asked
voice
with
a
worried
little
accent
from
the
attic
stairs
anything
happened
is
there
bad
news
from
mother
indeed
we
answered
in
light
the
gas
something
to
show
so
hazard
came
ernie
struck
a
match
and
again
in
the
dear
familiar
workshop
where
so
many
important
councils
have
been
held
so
many
family
problems
settled
we
read
the
contract
through
together
says
haze
with
a
little
sigh
it
is
really
found
what
a
scamp
that
perry
is
yes
elizabeth
you
and
i
will
see
uncle
george
this
coming
too
piped
ernie
found
it
i
want
to
see
what
he
will
say
so
after
dinner
it
was
rather
trying
i
can
tell
you
to
talk
and
eat
as
if
nothing
had
happened
because
we
did
not
think
it
wise
for
the
boarders
to
suspect
till
things
should
be
a
little
more
definitely
settled
slipped
into
our
hats
and
jackets
and
hurried
around
to
uncle
he
sat
at
his
desk
in
the
library
with
a
number
of
papers
before
him
and
he
looked
up
rather
surprised
and
displeased
as
william
ushered
us
into
the
room
wrong
at
home
he
began
are
not
in
trouble
again
i
hope
hazard
sir
says
haze
importantly
this
time
and
he
handed
uncle
george
the
contract
well
you
just
ought
to
have
seen
uncle
face
change
as
he
read
it
did
this
come
from
he
asked
abruptly
found
it
when
did
piped
ernie
afternoon
in
an
old
copy
of
engineering
and
oh
uncle
george
it
was
the
narrowest
escape
we
nearly
sent
it
to
manila
to
the
sick
soldiers
says
uncle
george
surveying
the
signatures
again
are
to
be
congratulated
young
and
then
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
as
if
to
himself
done
poor
dudley
a
great
injustice
apparently
he
altogether
a
and
turning
to
haze
he
continued
keep
this
paper
my
boy
and
look
out
for
your
interests
undoubtedly
you
have
all
been
very
badly
treated
with
the
contract
here
to
prove
it
we
could
prosecute
perry
and
perhaps
even
land
him
behind
the
bars
but
that
would
be
a
rather
poor
satisfaction
after
all
and
if
you
follow
my
advice
you
will
use
your
power
to
settle
things
as
expeditiously
and
as
much
to
your
advantage
as
yes
answered
ernie
haze
and
i
together
want
to
put
anybody
in
jail
all
we
want
is
a
little
returned
uncle
george
do
my
best
to
get
it
for
and
then
he
took
us
into
the
and
we
related
the
story
again
to
meta
and
aunt
adelaide
who
listened
with
all
their
ears
perfectly
dandy
cried
meta
clapping
her
hands
when
the
last
explanation
had
been
made
and
the
last
question
answered
i
am
so
and
i
guess
you
are
too
elizabeth
if
you
mind
being
poor
i
am
i
agreed
i
never
said
i
meta
that
there
were
certain
advantages
which
one
had
to
experience
to
find
and
then
aunt
adelaide
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
seltzer
lemonade
and
strawberry
shortcake
and
we
feasted
and
planned
and
later
we
came
home
and
planned
some
more
after
writing
the
good
news
to
mother
till
now
it
is
nearly
twelve
and
i
am
sitting
at
my
desk
pouring
out
the
wonderful
story
afresh
while
ernie
lolls
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
maunders
drowsily
think
try
cochin
chinas
unless
the
kind
that
wear
ruffly
pantalets
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
lady
that
started
with
one
egg
and
ended
with
fifty
thousand
dollars
oh
do
come
to
bed
elizabeth
or
it
will
never
be
morning
our
luck
has
changed
we
want
to
wake
up
and
find
that
we
dreamed
what
ernie
says
is
true
our
luck
has
changed
indeed
and
yet
is
luck
i
like
to
remember
something
the
kind
said
to
mother
one
evening
this
winter
when
robin
was
very
sick
when
rose
seemed
when
we
were
all
feeling
blue
graham
he
remarked
a
lucky
woman
i
care
how
vexatious
things
may
seem
i
care
how
unfortunate
four
such
children
as
you
have
bound
to
be
luck
in
a
house
it
pretty
of
him
and
now
that
the
contract
is
found
now
that
we
are
poor
no
longer
it
will
be
good
to
remember
that
for
better
or
worse
we
ourselves
must
always
be
the
luck
of
the
dudley
grahams
