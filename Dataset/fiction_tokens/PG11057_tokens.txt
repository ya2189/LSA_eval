i
ryder
was
going
to
give
a
ball
there
were
several
reasons
why
this
was
an
opportune
time
for
such
an
event
ryder
might
aptly
be
called
the
dean
of
the
blue
veins
the
original
blue
veins
were
a
little
society
of
colored
persons
organized
in
a
certain
northern
city
shortly
after
the
war
its
purpose
was
to
establish
and
maintain
correct
social
standards
among
a
people
whose
social
condition
presented
almost
unlimited
room
for
improvement
by
accident
combined
perhaps
with
some
natural
affinity
the
society
consisted
of
individuals
who
were
generally
speaking
more
white
than
black
some
envious
outsider
made
the
suggestion
that
no
one
was
eligible
for
membership
who
was
not
white
enough
to
show
blue
veins
the
suggestion
was
readily
adopted
by
those
who
were
not
of
the
favored
few
and
since
that
time
the
society
though
possessing
a
longer
and
more
pretentious
name
had
been
known
far
and
wide
as
the
blue
vein
society
and
its
members
as
the
blue
veins
the
blue
veins
did
not
allow
that
any
such
requirement
existed
for
admission
to
their
circle
but
on
the
contrary
declared
that
character
and
culture
were
the
only
things
considered
and
that
if
most
of
their
members
were
it
was
because
such
persons
as
a
rule
had
had
better
opportunities
to
qualify
themselves
for
membership
opinions
differed
too
as
to
the
usefulness
of
the
society
there
were
those
who
had
been
known
to
assail
it
violently
as
a
glaring
example
of
the
very
prejudice
from
which
the
colored
race
had
suffered
most
and
later
when
such
critics
had
succeeded
in
getting
on
the
inside
they
had
been
heard
to
maintain
with
zeal
and
earnestness
that
the
society
was
a
lifeboat
an
anchor
a
bulwark
and
a
shield
a
pillar
of
cloud
by
day
and
of
fire
by
night
to
guide
their
people
through
the
social
wilderness
another
alleged
prerequisite
for
blue
vein
membership
was
that
of
free
birth
and
while
there
was
really
no
such
requirement
it
is
doubtless
true
that
very
few
of
the
members
would
have
been
unable
to
meet
it
if
there
had
been
if
there
were
one
or
two
of
the
older
members
who
had
come
up
from
the
south
and
from
slavery
their
history
presented
enough
romantic
circumstances
to
rob
their
servile
origin
of
its
grosser
aspects
while
there
were
no
such
tests
of
eligibility
it
is
true
that
the
blue
veins
had
their
notions
on
these
subjects
and
that
not
all
of
them
were
equally
liberal
in
regard
to
the
things
they
collectively
disclaimed
ryder
was
one
of
the
most
conservative
though
he
had
not
been
among
the
founders
of
the
society
but
had
come
in
some
years
later
his
genius
for
social
leadership
was
such
that
he
had
speedily
become
its
recognized
adviser
and
head
the
custodian
of
its
standards
and
the
preserver
of
its
traditions
he
shaped
its
social
policy
was
active
in
providing
for
its
entertainment
and
when
the
interest
fell
off
as
it
sometimes
did
he
fanned
the
embers
until
they
burst
again
into
a
cheerful
flame
there
were
still
other
reasons
for
his
popularity
while
he
was
not
as
white
as
some
of
the
blue
veins
his
appearance
was
such
as
to
confer
distinction
upon
them
his
features
were
of
a
refined
type
his
hair
was
almost
straight
he
was
always
neatly
dressed
his
manners
were
irreproachable
and
his
morals
above
suspicion
he
had
come
to
groveland
a
young
man
and
obtaining
employment
in
the
office
of
a
railroad
company
as
messenger
had
in
time
worked
himself
up
to
the
position
of
stationery
clerk
having
charge
of
the
distribution
of
the
office
supplies
for
the
whole
company
although
the
lack
of
early
training
had
hindered
the
orderly
development
of
a
naturally
fine
mind
it
had
not
prevented
him
from
doing
a
great
deal
of
reading
or
from
forming
decidedly
literary
tastes
poetry
was
his
passion
he
could
repeat
whole
pages
of
the
great
english
poets
and
if
his
pronunciation
was
sometimes
faulty
his
eye
his
voice
his
gestures
would
respond
to
the
changing
sentiment
with
a
precision
that
revealed
a
poetic
soul
and
disarmed
criticism
he
was
economical
and
had
saved
money
he
owned
and
occupied
a
very
comfortable
house
on
a
respectable
street
his
residence
was
handsomely
furnished
containing
among
other
things
a
good
library
especially
rich
in
poetry
a
piano
and
some
choice
engravings
he
generally
shared
his
house
with
some
young
couple
who
looked
after
his
wants
and
were
company
for
him
for
ryder
was
a
single
man
in
the
early
days
of
his
connection
with
the
blue
veins
he
had
been
regarded
as
quite
a
catch
and
young
ladies
and
their
mothers
had
manoeuvred
with
much
ingenuity
to
capture
him
not
however
until
molly
dixon
visited
groveland
had
any
woman
ever
made
him
wish
to
change
his
condition
to
that
of
a
married
man
dixon
had
come
to
groveland
from
washington
in
the
spring
and
before
the
summer
was
over
she
had
won
ryder
heart
she
possessed
many
attractive
qualities
she
was
much
younger
than
he
in
fact
he
was
old
enough
to
have
been
her
father
though
no
one
knew
exactly
how
old
he
was
she
was
whiter
than
he
and
better
educated
she
had
moved
in
the
best
colored
society
of
the
country
at
washington
and
had
taught
in
the
schools
of
that
city
such
a
superior
person
had
been
eagerly
welcomed
to
the
blue
vein
society
and
had
taken
a
leading
part
in
its
activities
ryder
had
at
first
been
attracted
by
her
charms
of
person
for
she
was
very
good
looking
and
not
over
then
by
her
refined
manners
and
the
vivacity
of
her
wit
her
husband
had
been
a
government
clerk
and
at
his
death
had
left
a
considerable
life
insurance
she
was
visiting
friends
in
groveland
and
finding
the
town
and
the
people
to
her
liking
had
prolonged
her
stay
indefinitely
she
had
not
seemed
displeased
at
ryder
attentions
but
on
the
contrary
had
given
him
every
proper
encouragement
indeed
a
younger
and
less
cautious
man
would
long
since
have
spoken
but
he
had
made
up
his
mind
and
had
only
to
determine
the
time
when
he
would
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
he
decided
to
give
a
ball
in
her
honor
and
at
some
time
during
the
evening
of
the
ball
to
offer
her
his
heart
and
hand
he
had
no
special
fears
about
the
outcome
but
with
a
little
touch
of
romance
he
wanted
the
surroundings
to
be
in
harmony
with
his
own
feelings
when
he
should
have
received
the
answer
he
expected
ryder
resolved
that
this
ball
should
mark
an
epoch
in
the
social
history
of
groveland
he
knew
of
course
no
one
could
know
better
the
entertainments
that
had
taken
place
in
past
years
and
what
must
be
done
to
surpass
them
his
ball
must
be
worthy
of
the
lady
in
whose
honor
it
was
to
be
given
and
must
by
the
quality
of
its
guests
set
an
example
for
the
future
he
had
observed
of
late
a
growing
liberality
almost
a
laxity
in
social
matters
even
among
members
of
his
own
set
and
had
several
times
been
forced
to
meet
in
a
social
way
persons
whose
complexions
and
callings
in
life
were
hardly
up
to
the
standard
which
he
considered
proper
for
the
society
to
maintain
he
had
a
theory
of
his
own
i
have
no
race
prejudice
he
would
say
but
we
people
of
mixed
blood
are
ground
between
the
upper
and
the
nether
millstone
our
fate
lies
between
absorption
by
the
white
race
and
extinction
in
the
black
the
one
does
want
us
yet
but
may
take
us
in
time
the
other
would
welcome
us
but
it
would
be
for
us
a
backward
step
malice
towards
none
with
charity
for
all
we
must
do
the
best
we
can
for
ourselves
and
those
who
are
to
follow
us
is
the
first
law
of
nature
his
ball
would
serve
by
its
exclusiveness
to
counteract
leveling
tendencies
and
his
marriage
with
dixon
would
help
to
further
the
upward
process
of
absorption
he
had
been
wishing
and
waiting
for
ii
the
ball
was
to
take
place
on
friday
night
the
house
had
been
put
in
order
the
carpets
covered
with
canvas
the
halls
and
stairs
decorated
with
palms
and
potted
plants
and
in
the
afternoon
ryder
sat
on
his
front
porch
which
the
shade
of
a
vine
running
up
over
a
wire
netting
made
a
cool
and
pleasant
lounging
place
he
expected
to
respond
to
the
toast
the
ladies
at
the
supper
and
from
a
volume
of
tennyson
his
favorite
poet
was
fortifying
himself
with
apt
quotations
the
volume
was
open
at
a
dream
of
fair
women
his
eyes
fell
on
these
lines
and
he
read
them
aloud
to
judge
better
of
their
effect
at
length
i
saw
a
lady
within
call
stiller
than
chisell
marble
standing
there
a
daughter
of
the
gods
divinely
tall
and
most
divinely
fair
he
marked
the
verse
and
turning
the
page
read
the
stanza
beginning
o
sweet
pale
margaret
o
rare
pale
margaret
he
weighed
the
passage
a
moment
and
decided
that
it
would
not
do
dixon
was
the
palest
lady
he
expected
at
the
ball
and
she
was
of
a
rather
ruddy
complexion
and
of
lively
disposition
and
buxom
build
so
he
ran
over
the
leaves
until
his
eye
rested
on
the
description
of
queen
guinevere
she
seem
a
part
of
joyous
spring
a
gown
of
silk
she
wore
buckled
with
golden
clasps
before
a
tuft
of
plumes
she
bore
closed
in
a
golden
ring
she
look
so
lovely
as
she
the
rein
with
dainty
a
man
had
given
all
other
bliss
and
all
his
worldly
worth
for
this
to
waste
his
whole
heart
in
one
kiss
upon
her
perfect
lips
as
ryder
murmured
these
words
audibly
with
an
appreciative
thrill
he
heard
the
latch
of
his
gate
click
and
a
light
footfall
sounding
on
the
steps
he
turned
his
head
and
saw
a
woman
standing
before
his
door
she
was
a
little
woman
not
five
feet
tall
and
proportioned
to
her
height
although
she
stood
erect
and
looked
around
her
with
very
bright
and
restless
eyes
she
seemed
quite
old
for
her
face
was
crossed
and
recrossed
with
a
hundred
wrinkles
and
around
the
edges
of
her
bonnet
could
be
seen
protruding
here
and
there
a
tuft
of
short
gray
wool
she
wore
a
blue
calico
gown
of
ancient
cut
a
little
red
shawl
fastened
around
her
shoulders
with
an
brass
brooch
and
a
large
bonnet
profusely
ornamented
with
faded
red
and
yellow
artificial
flowers
and
she
was
very
black
so
black
that
her
toothless
gums
revealed
when
she
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
were
not
red
but
blue
she
looked
like
a
bit
of
the
old
plantation
life
summoned
up
from
the
past
by
the
wave
of
a
magician
wand
as
the
poet
fancy
had
called
into
being
the
gracious
shapes
of
which
ryder
had
just
been
reading
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
came
over
to
where
she
stood
madam
he
said
suh
she
answered
ducking
suddenly
with
a
quaint
curtsy
her
voice
was
shrill
and
piping
but
softened
somewhat
by
age
is
dis
yere
whar
mistuh
ryduh
lib
suh
she
asked
looking
around
her
doubtfully
and
glancing
into
the
open
windows
through
which
some
of
the
preparations
for
the
evening
were
visible
yes
he
replied
with
an
air
of
kindly
patronage
unconsciously
flattered
by
her
manner
i

a
smile
stole
over
her
withered
countenance
as
she
paused
a
moment
and
her
bright
eyes
softened
into
a
look
this
was
the
substance
of
the
old
woman
story
she
had
wandered
a
little
here
and
there
ryder
was
looking
at
her
curiously
when
she
finished
how
have

she
smiled
incredulously
i

an
i

picture
roun
wid
me
years
may
i
see
it
asked
ryder
it
might
help
me
to
remember
whether
i
have
seen
the
original
as
she
drew
a
small
parcel
from
her
bosom
he
saw
that
it
was
fastened
to
a
string
that
went
around
her
neck
removing
several
wrappers
she
brought
to
light
an
daguerreotype
in
a
black
case
he
looked
long
and
intently
at
the
portrait
it
was
faded
with
time
but
the
features
were
still
distinct
and
it
was
easy
to
see
what
manner
of
man
it
had
represented
he
closed
the
case
and
with
a
slow
movement
handed
it
back
to
her
i
do
know
of
any
man
in
town
who
goes
by
that
name
he
said
nor
have
i
heard
of
any
one
making
such
inquiries
but
if
you
will
leave
me
your
address
i
will
give
the
matter
some
attention
and
if
i
find
out
anything
i
will
let
you
know
she
gave
him
the
number
of
a
house
in
the
neighborhood
and
went
away
after
thanking
him
warmly
he
wrote
the
address
on
the
of
the
volume
of
tennyson
and
when
she
had
gone
rose
to
his
feet
and
stood
looking
after
her
curiously
as
she
walked
down
the
street
with
mincing
step
he
saw
several
persons
whom
she
passed
turn
and
look
back
at
her
with
a
smile
of
kindly
amusement
when
she
had
turned
the
corner
he
went
upstairs
to
his
bedroom
and
stood
for
a
long
time
before
the
mirror
of
his
gazing
thoughtfully
at
the
reflection
of
his
own
face
iii
at
eight
the
ballroom
was
a
blaze
of
light
and
the
guests
had
begun
to
assemble
for
there
was
a
literary
programme
and
some
routine
business
of
the
society
to
be
gone
through
with
before
the
dancing
a
black
servant
in
evening
dress
waited
at
the
door
and
directed
the
guests
to
the
the
occasion
was
long
memorable
among
the
colored
people
of
the
city
not
alone
for
the
dress
and
display
but
for
the
high
average
of
intelligence
and
culture
that
distinguished
the
gathering
as
a
whole
there
were
a
number
of
several
young
doctors
three
or
four
lawyers
some
professional
singers
an
editor
a
lieutenant
in
the
united
states
army
spending
his
furlough
in
the
city
and
others
in
various
polite
callings
these
were
colored
though
most
of
them
would
not
have
attracted
even
a
casual
glance
because
of
any
marked
difference
from
white
people
most
of
the
ladies
were
in
evening
costume
and
dress
coats
and
dancing
pumps
were
the
rule
among
the
men
a
band
of
string
music
stationed
in
an
alcove
behind
a
row
of
palms
played
popular
airs
while
the
guests
were
gathering
the
dancing
began
at
half
past
nine
at
eleven
supper
was
served
ryder
had
left
the
ballroom
some
little
time
before
the
intermission
but
reappeared
at
the
the
spread
was
worthy
of
the
occasion
and
the
guests
did
full
justice
to
it
when
the
coffee
had
been
served
the
solomon
sadler
rapped
for
order
he
made
a
brief
introductory
speech
complimenting
host
and
guests
and
then
presented
in
their
order
the
toasts
of
the
evening
they
were
responded
to
with
a
very
fair
display
of
wit
the
last
toast
said
the
when
he
reached
the
end
of
the
list
is
one
which
must
appeal
to
us
all
there
is
no
one
of
us
of
the
sterner
sex
who
is
not
at
some
time
dependent
upon
woman
in
infancy
for
protection
in
manhood
for
companionship
in
old
age
for
care
and
comforting
our
good
host
has
been
trying
to
live
alone
but
the
fair
faces
i
see
around
me
prove
that
he
too
is
largely
dependent
upon
the
gentler
sex
for
most
that
makes
life
worth
living
the
society
and
love
of
friends
and
rumor
is
at
fault
if
he
does
not
soon
yield
entire
subjection
to
one
of
them
ryder
will
now
respond
to
the
toast
the
ladies
there
was
a
pensive
look
in
ryder
eyes
as
he
took
the
floor
and
adjusted
his
eyeglasses
he
began
by
speaking
of
woman
as
the
gift
of
heaven
to
man
and
after
some
general
observations
on
the
relations
of
the
sexes
he
said
but
perhaps
the
quality
which
most
distinguishes
woman
is
her
fidelity
and
devotion
to
those
she
loves
history
is
full
of
examples
but
has
recorded
none
more
striking
than
one
which
only
came
under
my
notice
he
then
related
simply
but
effectively
the
story
told
by
his
visitor
of
the
afternoon
he
gave
it
in
the
same
soft
dialect
which
came
readily
to
his
lips
while
the
company
listened
attentively
and
sympathetically
for
the
story
had
awakened
a
responsive
thrill
in
many
hearts
there
were
some
present
who
had
seen
and
others
who
had
heard
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
tell
the
wrongs
and
sufferings
of
this
past
generation
and
all
of
them
still
felt
in
their
darker
moments
the
shadow
hanging
over
them
ryder
went
on
such
devotion
and
confidence
are
rare
even
among
women
there
are
many
who
would
have
searched
a
year
some
who
would
have
waited
five
years
a
few
who
might
have
hoped
ten
years
but
for
years
this
woman
has
retained
her
affection
for
and
her
faith
in
a
man
she
has
not
seen
or
heard
of
in
all
that
time
she
came
to
me
in
the
hope
that
i
might
be
able
to
help
her
find
this
husband
and
when
she
was
gone
i
gave
my
fancy
rein
and
imagined
a
case
i
will
put
to
you
suppose
that
this
husband
soon
after
his
escape
had
learned
that
his
wife
had
been
sold
away
and
that
such
inquiries
as
he
could
make
brought
no
information
of
her
whereabouts
suppose
that
he
was
young
and
she
much
older
than
he
that
he
was
light
and
she
was
black
that
their
marriage
was
a
slave
marriage
and
legally
binding
only
if
they
chose
to
make
it
so
after
the
war
suppose
too
that
he
made
his
way
to
the
north
as
some
of
us
have
done
and
there
where
he
had
larger
opportunities
had
improved
them
and
had
in
the
course
of
all
these
years
grown
to
be
as
different
from
the
ignorant
boy
who
ran
away
from
fear
of
slavery
as
the
day
is
from
the
night
suppose
even
that
he
had
qualified
himself
by
industry
by
thrift
and
by
study
to
win
the
friendship
and
be
considered
worthy
the
society
of
such
people
as
these
i
see
around
me
gracing
my
board
and
filling
my
heart
with
gladness
for
i
am
old
enough
to
remember
the
day
when
such
a
gathering
would
not
have
been
possible
in
this
land
suppose
too
that
as
the
years
went
by
this
man
memory
of
the
past
grew
more
and
more
indistinct
until
at
last
it
was
rarely
except
in
his
dreams
that
any
image
of
this
bygone
period
rose
before
his
mind
and
then
suppose
that
accident
should
bring
to
his
knowledge
the
fact
that
the
wife
of
his
youth
the
wife
he
had
left
behind
him
not
one
who
had
walked
by
his
side
and
kept
pace
with
him
in
his
upward
struggle
but
one
upon
whom
advancing
years
and
a
laborious
life
had
set
their
mark
was
alive
and
seeking
him
but
that
he
was
absolutely
safe
from
recognition
or
discovery
unless
he
chose
to
reveal
himself
my
friends
what
would
the
man
do
i
will
presume
that
he
was
one
who
loved
honor
and
tried
to
deal
justly
with
all
men
i
will
even
carry
the
case
further
and
suppose
that
perhaps
he
had
set
his
heart
upon
another
whom
he
had
hoped
to
call
his
own
what
would
he
do
or
rather
what
ought
he
to
do
in
such
a
crisis
of
a
lifetime
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
might
hesitate
and
i
imagined
that
i
was
an
old
friend
a
near
friend
and
that
he
had
come
to
me
for
advice
and
i
argued
the
case
with
him
i
tried
to
discuss
it
impartially
after
we
had
looked
upon
the
matter
from
every
point
of
view
i
said
to
him
in
words
that
we
all
know
above
all
to
thine
own
self
be
true
and
it
must
follow
as
the
night
the
day
thou
canst
not
then
be
false
to
any
man
then
finally
i
put
the
question
to
him
you
acknowledge
her
and
now
ladies
and
gentlemen
friends
and
companions
i
ask
you
what
should
he
have
done
there
was
something
in
ryder
voice
that
stirred
the
hearts
of
those
who
sat
around
him
it
suggested
more
than
mere
sympathy
with
an
imaginary
situation
it
seemed
rather
in
the
nature
of
a
personal
appeal
it
was
observed
too
that
his
look
rested
more
especially
upon
dixon
with
a
mingled
expression
of
renunciation
and
inquiry
she
had
listened
with
parted
lips
and
streaming
eyes
she
was
the
first
to
speak
he
should
have
acknowledged
her
yes
they
all
echoed
he
should
have
acknowledged
her
my
friends
and
companions
responded
ryder
i
thank
you
one
and
all
it
is
the
answer
i
expected
for
i
knew
your
hearts
he
turned
and
walked
toward
the
closed
door
of
an
adjoining
room
while
every
eye
followed
him
in
wondering
curiosity
he
came
back
in
a
moment
leading
by
the
hand
his
visitor
of
the
afternoon
who
stood
startled
and
trembling
at
the
sudden
plunge
into
this
scene
of
brilliant
gayety
she
was
neatly
dressed
in
gray
and
wore
the
white
cap
of
an
elderly
woman
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
this
is
the
woman
and
i
am
the
man
whose
story
i
have
told
you
permit
me
to
introduce
to
you
the
wife
of
my
youth
her
virginia
mammy
i
the
pianist
had
struck
up
a
lively
and
soon
the
floor
was
covered
with
couples
each
turning
on
its
own
axis
and
all
revolving
around
a
common
centre
in
obedience
perhaps
to
the
same
law
of
motion
that
governs
the
planetary
systems
the
was
a
long
room
with
a
waxed
floor
that
glistened
with
the
reflection
of
the
lights
from
the
chandeliers
the
walls
were
hung
in
paper
of
blue
and
white
above
a
varnished
hard
wood
wainscoting
the
monotony
of
surface
being
broken
by
numerous
windows
draped
with
curtains
of
dotted
muslin
and
by
occasional
engravings
and
colored
pictures
representing
the
dances
of
various
nations
judiciously
selected
the
rows
of
chairs
along
the
two
sides
of
the
room
were
left
unoccupied
by
the
time
the
music
was
well
under
way
for
the
pianist
a
tall
colored
woman
with
long
fingers
and
a
muscular
wrist
played
with
a
verve
and
a
swing
that
set
the
feet
of
the
listeners
involuntarily
in
motion
the
dance
was
sure
to
occupy
the
class
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
least
and
the
little
took
the
opportunity
to
slip
away
to
her
own
which
was
on
the
same
floor
of
the
block
for
a
few
minutes
of
rest
her
day
had
been
a
hard
one
there
had
been
a
matinee
at
two
a
children
class
at
four
and
at
eight
the
class
now
on
the
floor
had
assembled
when
she
reached
the
she
gave
a
start
of
pleasure
a
young
man
rose
at
her
entrance
and
advanced
with
both
hands
extended
a
tall
young
man
with
a
frank
and
kindly
countenance
now
lit
up
with
the
animation
of
pleasure
he
seemed
about
or
years
old
his
face
was
of
the
type
one
instinctively
associates
with
intellect
and
character
and
it
gave
the
impression
besides
of
that
intangible
something
which
we
call
race
he
was
neatly
and
carefully
dressed
though
his
clothing
was
not
without
indications
that
he
found
it
necessary
or
expedient
to
practice
economy
clara
he
said
taking
her
hands
in
his
i
been
waiting
for
you
five
minutes
i
supposed
you
would
be
in
but
if
you
had
been
a
moment
later
i
was
going
to
the
hall
to
look
you
up
you
seem
tired
he
added
drawing
her
nearer
to
him
and
scanning
her
features
at
short
range
this
work
is
too
hard
you
are
not
fitted
for
it
when
are
you
going
to
give
it
up
the
season
is
almost
over
she
answered
and
then
i
shall
stop
for
the
summer
he
drew
her
closer
still
and
kissed
her
lovingly
tell
me
clara
he
said
looking
down
into
her
face
he
was
at
least
a
foot
taller
than
she
when
i
am
to
have
my
answer
will
you
take
the
answer
you
can
get
she
asked
with
a
wan
smile
i
will
take
but
one
answer
clara
but
do
not
make
me
wait
too
long
for
that
why
just
think
of
it
i
have
known
you
for
six
months
that
is
an
extremely
long
time
said
clara
as
they
sat
down
side
by
side
it
has
been
an
age
he
rejoined
for
a
fortnight
of
it
too
which
seems
longer
than
all
the
rest
i
have
been
waiting
for
my
answer
i
am
turning
gray
under
the
suspense
seriously
clara
dear
what
shall
it
be
or
rather
when
shall
it
be
for
to
the
other
question
there
is
but
one
answer
possible
he
looked
into
her
eyes
which
slowly
filled
with
tears
she
repulsed
him
gently
as
he
bent
over
to
kiss
them
away
you
know
i
love
you
john
and
why
i
do
not
say
what
you
wish
you
must
give
me
a
little
more
time
to
make
up
my
mind
before
i
can
consent
to
burden
you
with
a
nameless
wife
one
who
does
not
know
who
her
mother
was
she
was
a
good
woman
and
beautiful
if
you
are
at
all
like
her
or
her
father
he
was
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
if
you
inherited
from
him
your
mind
or
your
manners
it
is
good
of
you
to
say
that
and
i
try
to
believe
it
but
it
is
a
serious
matter
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
to
have
no
name
you
are
known
by
a
worthy
one
which
was
freely
given
you
and
is
legally
yours
i
know
and
i
am
grateful
for
it
after
all
though
it
is
not
my
real
name
and
since
i
have
learned
that
it
was
not
it
seems
like
a
garment
something
external
accessory
and
not
a
part
of
myself
it
does
not
mean
what
one
own
name
would
signify
take
mine
clara
and
make
it
yours
i
lay
it
at
your
feet
some
honored
men
have
borne
it
ah
yes
and
that
is
what
makes
my
position
the
harder
your
was
governor
of
connecticut
i
have
heard
my
mother
say
so
and
one
of
your
ancestors
came
over
in
the
mayflower
in
some
capacity
i
have
never
been
quite
clear
whether
as
ship
cook
or
before
the
mast
now
you
are
insincere
john
but
you
can
not
deceive
me
you
never
spoke
in
that
way
about
your
ancestors
until
you
learned
that
i
had
none
i
know
you
are
proud
of
them
and
that
the
memory
of
the
governor
and
the
judge
and
the
harvard
professor
and
the
mayflower
pilgrim
makes
you
strive
to
excel
in
order
to
prove
yourself
worthy
of
them
it
did
until
i
met
you
clara
now
the
one
inspiration
of
my
life
is
the
hope
to
make
you
mine
and
your
profession
it
will
furnish
me
the
means
to
take
you
out
of
this
you
are
not
fit
for
toil
and
your
book
your
treatise
that
is
to
make
you
famous
i
have
worked
twice
as
hard
on
it
and
accomplished
twice
as
much
since
i
have
hoped
that
you
might
share
my
success
oh
if
i
but
knew
the
truth
she
sighed
or
could
find
it
out
i
realize
that
i
am
absurd
that
i
ought
to
be
happy
i
love
my
parents
my
dearly
i
owe
them
everything
mother
poor
dear
mother
could
not
have
loved
me
better
or
cared
for
me
more
faithfully
had
i
been
her
own
child
yet
i
am
ashamed
to
say
it
i
always
felt
that
i
was
not
like
them
that
there
was
a
subtle
difference
between
us
they
were
contented
in
prosperity
resigned
in
misfortune
i
was
ever
restless
and
filled
with
vague
ambitions
they
were
good
but
dull
they
loved
me
but
they
never
said
so
i
feel
that
there
is
warmer
richer
blood
coursing
in
my
veins
than
the
placid
stream
that
crept
through
theirs
there
will
never
be
any
such
people
to
me
as
they
were
said
her
lover
for
they
took
you
and
brought
you
up
for
me
sometimes
she
went
on
dreamily
i
feel
sure
that
i
am
of
good
family
and
the
blood
of
my
ancestors
seems
to
call
to
me
in
clear
and
certain
tones
then
again
when
my
mood
changes
i
am
all
at
sea
i
feel
that
even
if
i
had
but
simply
to
turn
my
hand
to
learn
who
i
am
and
whence
i
came
i
should
shrink
from
taking
the
step
for
fear
that
what
i
might
learn
would
leave
me
forever
unhappy
dearest
he
said
taking
her
in
his
arms
while
from
the
hall
and
down
the
corridor
came
the
softened
strains
of
music
put
aside
these
unwholesome
fancies
your
past
is
shrouded
in
mystery
take
my
name
as
you
have
taken
my
love
and
i
make
your
future
so
happy
that
you
wo
have
time
to
think
of
the
past
what
are
a
lot
of
musty
mouldy
old
grandfathers
compared
with
life
and
love
and
happiness
it
hardly
good
form
to
mention
one
ancestors
nowadays
and
what
the
use
of
them
at
all
if
one
ca
boast
of
them
it
all
very
well
of
you
to
talk
that
way
she
rejoined
but
suppose
you
should
marry
me
and
when
you
become
famous
and
rich
and
patients
flock
to
your
office
and
fashionable
people
to
your
home
and
every
one
wants
to
know
who
you
are
and
whence
you
came
you
be
obliged
to
bring
out
the
governor
and
the
judge
and
the
rest
of
them
if
you
should
refrain
in
order
to
forestall
embarrassing
inquiries
about
ancestry
i
should
have
deprived
you
of
something
you
are
entitled
to
something
which
has
a
real
social
value
and
when
people
found
out
all
about
you
as
they
eventually
would
from
some
source
they
would
want
to
know
we
americans
are
a
curious
people
who
your
wife
was
and
you
could
only
say
the
best
and
sweetest
woman
on
earth
whom
i
love
unspeakably
you
know
that
is
not
what
i
mean
you
could
only
say
a
miss
nobody
from
nowhere
a
miss
hohlfelder
from
cincinnati
the
only
child
of
worthy
german
parents
who
fled
from
their
own
country
in
to
escape
political
persecution
an
ancestry
that
one
surely
need
not
be
ashamed
of
no
but
the
consciousness
that
it
was
not
true
would
be
always
with
me
poisoning
my
mind
and
darkening
my
life
and
yours
your
views
of
life
are
entirely
too
tragic
clara
the
young
man
argued
soothingly
we
are
all
worms
of
the
dust
and
if
we
go
back
far
enough
each
of
us
has
had
millions
of
ancestors
peasants
and
serfs
most
of
them
thieves
murderers
and
vagabonds
many
of
them
no
doubt
and
therefore
the
best
of
us
have
but
little
to
boast
of
yet
we
are
all
made
after
god
own
image
and
formed
by
his
hand
for
his
ends
and
therefore
not
to
be
lightly
despised
even
the
humblest
of
us
least
of
all
by
ourselves
for
the
past
we
can
claim
no
credit
for
those
who
made
it
died
with
it
our
destiny
lies
in
the
future
yes
she
sighed
i
know
all
that
but
i
am
not
like
you
a
woman
is
not
like
a
man
she
can
not
lose
herself
in
theories
and
generalizations
and
there
are
tests
that
even
all
your
philosophy
could
not
endure
suppose
you
should
marry
me
and
then
some
time
by
the
merest
accident
you
should
learn
that
my
origin
was
the
worst
it
could
be
that
i
not
only
had
no
name
but
was
not
entitled
to
one
i
can
not
believe
it
he
said
and
from
what
we
do
know
of
your
history
it
is
hardly
possible
if
i
learned
it
i
should
forget
it
unless
perchance
it
should
enhance
your
value
in
my
eyes
by
stamping
you
as
a
rare
work
of
nature
an
exception
to
the
law
of
heredity
a
triumph
of
pure
beauty
and
goodness
over
the
grosser
limitations
of
matter
i
can
not
imagine
now
that
i
know
you
anything
that
could
make
me
love
you
less
i
would
marry
you
just
the
same
even
if
you
were
one
of
your
i
must
go
back
to
them
said
clara
as
the
music
ceased
my
answer
he
urged
give
me
my
answer
not
john
she
pleaded
grant
me
a
little
longer
time
to
make
up
my
mind
for
your
sake
not
for
my
sake
clara
no
well
for
mine
she
let
him
take
her
in
his
arms
and
kiss
her
again
i
have
a
patient
yet
to
see
he
said
as
he
went
out
if
i
am
not
detained
too
long
i
may
come
back
this
way
if
i
see
the
lights
in
the
hall
still
burning
do
not
wonder
if
i
ask
you
again
for
my
answer
for
i
shall
be
unhappy
until
i
get
it
ii
a
stranger
entering
the
hall
with
miss
hohlfelder
would
have
seen
at
first
glance
only
a
company
of
people
with
nothing
to
specially
distinguish
them
from
ordinary
humanity
in
temperate
climates
after
the
eye
had
rested
for
a
moment
and
begun
to
separate
the
mass
into
its
component
parts
one
or
two
dark
faces
would
have
arrested
its
attention
and
with
the
suggestion
thus
offered
a
closer
inspection
would
have
revealed
that
they
were
nearly
all
a
little
less
than
white
with
most
of
them
this
fact
would
not
have
been
noticed
while
they
were
alone
or
in
company
with
one
another
though
if
a
fair
white
person
had
gone
among
them
it
would
perhaps
have
been
more
apparent
from
the
few
who
were
undistinguishable
from
pure
white
the
colors
ran
down
the
scale
by
minute
gradations
to
the
two
or
three
brown
faces
at
the
other
extremity
it
was
miss
hohlfelder
first
colored
class
she
had
been
somewhat
startled
when
first
asked
to
take
it
no
person
of
color
had
ever
applied
to
her
for
lessons
and
while
a
woman
of
that
race
had
played
the
piano
for
her
for
several
months
she
had
never
thought
of
colored
people
as
possible
pupils
so
when
she
was
asked
if
she
would
take
a
class
of
twenty
or
thirty
she
had
hesitated
and
begged
for
time
to
consider
the
application
she
knew
that
several
of
the
more
fashionable
tabooed
all
pupils
singly
or
in
classes
who
labored
under
social
disabilities
and
this
included
the
people
of
at
least
one
other
race
who
were
vastly
farther
along
in
the
world
than
the
colored
people
of
the
community
where
miss
hohlfelder
lived
personally
she
had
no
such
prejudice
except
perhaps
a
little
shrinking
at
the
thought
of
personal
contact
with
the
dark
faces
of
whom
americans
always
think
when
colored
people
are
spoken
of
again
a
class
of
forty
pupils
was
not
to
be
despised
for
she
taught
for
money
which
was
equally
current
and
desirable
regardless
of
its
color
she
had
consulted
her
and
after
them
her
lover
her
who
were
and
had
never
become
thoroughly
americanized
saw
no
objection
as
for
her
lover
he
was
indifferent
do
as
you
please
he
said
it
may
drive
away
some
other
pupils
if
it
should
break
up
the
business
entirely
perhaps
you
might
be
willing
to
give
me
a
chance
so
much
the
sooner
she
mentioned
the
matter
to
one
or
two
other
friends
who
expressed
conflicting
opinions
she
decided
at
length
to
take
the
class
and
take
the
consequences
i
do
think
it
would
be
either
right
or
kind
to
refuse
them
for
any
such
reason
and
i
do
believe
i
shall
lose
anything
by
it
she
was
somewhat
surprised
and
pleasantly
so
when
her
class
came
together
for
their
first
lesson
at
not
finding
them
darker
and
more
uncouth
her
pupils
were
mostly
people
whom
she
would
have
passed
on
the
street
without
a
second
glance
and
among
them
were
several
whom
she
had
known
by
sight
for
years
but
had
never
dreamed
of
as
being
colored
people
their
manners
were
good
they
dressed
quietly
and
as
a
rule
with
good
taste
avoiding
rather
than
choosing
bright
colors
and
striking
combinations
whether
from
natural
preference
or
because
of
a
slightly
morbid
shrinking
from
criticism
of
course
she
could
not
say
among
them
the
soon
learned
there
were
lawyers
and
doctors
teachers
telegraph
operators
clerks
milliners
and
dressmakers
students
of
the
local
college
and
scientific
school
and
somewhat
to
her
awe
at
the
first
meeting
even
a
member
of
the
legislature
they
were
mostly
young
although
a
few
older
people
joined
the
class
as
much
for
company
as
for
the
dancing
of
course
miss
hohlfelder
explained
solomon
sadler
to
whom
the
teacher
had
paid
a
compliment
on
the
quality
of
the
class
the
more
advanced
of
us
are
not
numerous
enough
to
make
the
fine
distinctions
that
are
possible
among
white
people
and
of
course
as
we
rise
in
life
we
ca
get
entirely
away
from
our
brothers
and
our
sisters
and
our
cousins
who
do
always
keep
abreast
of
us
we
do
however
draw
certain
lines
of
character
and
manners
and
occupation
you
see
the
sort
of
people
we
are
of
course
we
have
no
prejudice
against
color
and
we
regard
all
labor
as
honorable
provided
a
man
does
the
best
he
can
but
we
must
have
standards
that
will
give
our
people
something
to
aspire
to
the
class
was
not
a
difficult
one
as
many
of
the
members
were
already
fairly
good
dancers
indeed
the
class
had
been
formed
as
much
for
pleasure
as
for
instruction
music
and
hall
rent
and
a
knowledge
of
the
latest
dances
could
be
obtained
cheaper
in
this
way
than
in
any
other
the
pupils
had
made
rapid
progress
displaying
in
fact
a
natural
aptitude
for
rhythmic
motion
and
a
keen
susceptibility
to
musical
sounds
as
their
race
had
never
been
criticised
for
these
characteristics
they
gave
them
full
play
and
soon
developed
most
of
them
into
graceful
and
indefatigable
dancers
they
were
now
almost
at
the
end
of
their
course
and
this
was
the
evening
of
the
last
lesson
but
one
miss
hohlfelder
had
remarked
to
her
lover
more
than
once
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
teach
them
they
enter
into
the
spirit
of
it
so
thoroughly
and
they
seem
to
enjoy
themselves
so
much
one
would
think
he
suggested
that
the
whitest
of
them
would
find
their
position
painful
and
more
or
less
pathetic
to
be
so
white
and
yet
to
be
classed
as
black
so
near
and
yet
so
far
they
do
accept
our
classification
blindly
they
do
not
acknowledge
any
inferiority
they
think
they
are
a
great
deal
better
than
any
but
the
best
white
people
replied
miss
hohlfelder
and
since
they
have
been
coming
here
do
you
know
she
went
on
i
hardly
think
of
them
as
any
different
from
other
people
i
feel
perfectly
at
home
among
them
it
is
a
great
thing
to
have
faith
in
one
self
he
replied
it
is
a
fine
thing
too
to
be
able
to
enjoy
the
passing
moment
one
of
your
greatest
charms
in
my
eyes
clara
is
that
in
your
lighter
moods
you
have
this
faculty
you
sing
because
you
love
to
sing
you
find
pleasure
in
dancing
even
by
way
of
work
you
feel
the
de
the
joy
of
living
you
are
not
always
so
but
when
you
are
so
i
think
you
most
delightful
miss
hohlfelder
upon
entering
the
hall
spoke
to
the
pianist
and
then
exchanged
a
few
words
with
various
members
of
the
class
the
pianist
began
to
play
a
dreamy
strauss
waltz
when
the
dance
was
well
under
way
miss
hohlfelder
left
the
hall
again
and
stepped
into
the
there
was
a
woman
seated
quietly
on
a
couch
in
a
corner
her
hands
folded
on
her
lap
miss
hohlfelder
you
do
not
seem
as
bright
as
usual
miss
hohlfelder
felt
a
sudden
yearning
for
sympathy
perhaps
it
was
the
gentle
tones
of
the
greeting
perhaps
the
kindly
expression
of
the
soft
though
faded
eyes
that
were
scanning
miss
hohlfelder
features
the
woman
was
of
the
indefinite
age
between
forty
and
fifty
there
were
lines
on
her
face
which
if
due
to
years
might
have
carried
her
even
past
the
mark
but
if
caused
by
trouble
or
ill
health
might
leave
her
somewhat
below
it
she
was
quietly
dressed
in
black
and
wore
her
slightly
wavy
hair
low
over
her
ears
where
it
lay
naturally
in
the
ripples
which
some
others
of
her
sex
so
sedulously
seek
by
art
a
little
woman
of
clear
olive
complexion
and
regular
features
her
face
was
almost
a
perfect
oval
except
as
time
had
marred
its
outline
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
the
class
with
some
young
women
of
the
family
she
lived
with
part
boarder
part
seamstress
and
friend
of
the
family
sometimes
while
waiting
for
her
young
charges
the
music
would
jar
her
nerves
and
she
would
seek
the
comparative
quiet
of
the
oh
i
all
right
harper
replied
the
with
a
brave
attempt
at
cheerfulness
just
a
little
tired
after
a
hard
work
she
sat
down
on
the
couch
by
the
elder
woman
side
harper
took
her
hand
and
stroked
it
gently
and
clara
felt
soothed
and
quieted
by
her
touch
there
are
tears
in
your
eyes
and
trouble
in
your
face
i
know
it
for
i
have
shed
the
one
and
known
the
other
tell
me
child
what
ails
you
i
am
older
than
you
and
perhaps
i
have
learned
some
things
in
the
hard
school
of
life
that
may
be
of
comfort
or
service
to
you
such
a
request
coming
from
a
comparative
stranger
might
very
properly
have
been
resented
or
lightly
parried
but
clara
was
not
what
would
be
called
her
griefs
seemed
lighter
when
they
were
shared
with
others
even
in
spirit
there
was
in
her
nature
a
childish
strain
that
craved
sympathy
and
comforting
she
had
never
known
or
if
so
it
was
only
in
a
dim
and
dreamlike
past
the
tender
brooding
care
that
was
her
conception
of
a
mother
love
hohlfelder
had
been
fond
of
her
in
a
placid
way
and
had
given
her
every
comfort
and
luxury
her
means
permitted
clara
ideal
of
maternal
love
had
been
of
another
and
more
romantic
type
she
had
thought
of
a
fond
impulsive
mother
to
whose
bosom
she
could
fly
when
in
trouble
or
distress
and
to
whom
she
could
communicate
her
sorrows
and
trials
who
would
dry
her
tears
and
soothe
her
with
caresses
now
when
even
her
kind
was
gone
she
felt
still
more
the
need
of
sympathy
and
companionship
with
her
own
sex
and
when
this
little
harper
spoke
to
her
so
gently
she
felt
her
heart
respond
instinctively
yes
harper
replied
clara
with
a
sigh
i
am
in
trouble
but
it
is
trouble
that
you
nor
any
one
else
can
heal
you
do
not
know
child
a
simple
remedy
can
sometimes
cure
a
very
grave
complaint
tell
me
your
trouble
if
it
is
something
you
are
at
liberty
to
tell
i
have
a
story
said
clara
and
it
is
a
strange
one
a
story
i
have
told
to
but
one
other
person
one
very
dear
to
me
he
must
be
dear
to
you
indeed
from
the
tone
in
which
you
speak
of
him
your
very
accents
breathe
love
yes
i
love
him
and
if
you
saw
him
perhaps
you
have
seen
him
for
he
has
looked
in
here
once
or
twice
during
the
you
would
know
why
i
love
him
he
is
handsome
he
is
learned
he
is
ambitious
he
is
brave
he
is
good
he
is
poor
but
he
will
not
always
be
so
and
he
loves
me
oh
so
much
the
other
woman
smiled
it
is
not
so
strange
to
love
nor
yet
to
be
loved
and
all
lovers
are
handsome
and
brave
and
fond
that
is
not
all
of
my
story
he
wants
to
marry
me
clara
paused
as
if
to
let
this
statement
impress
itself
upon
the
other
true
lovers
always
do
said
the
elder
woman
but
sometimes
you
know
there
are
circumstances
which
prevent
them
ah
yes
murmured
the
other
reflectively
and
looking
at
the
girl
with
deeper
interest
circumstances
which
prevent
them
i
have
known
of
such
a
case
the
circumstance
which
prevents
us
from
marrying
is
my
story
tell
me
your
story
child
and
perhaps
if
i
can
not
help
you
otherwise
i
can
tell
you
one
that
will
make
yours
seem
less
sad
you
know
me
said
the
young
woman
as
miss
hohlfelder
but
that
is
not
actually
my
name
in
fact
i
do
not
know
my
real
name
for
i
am
not
the
daughter
of
and
hohlfelder
but
only
an
adopted
child
while
hohlfelder
lived
i
never
knew
that
i
was
not
her
child
i
knew
i
was
very
different
from
her
and
father
i
mean
hohlfelder
i
knew
they
were
fair
and
i
was
dark
they
were
stout
and
i
was
slender
they
were
slow
and
i
was
quick
but
of
course
i
never
dreamed
of
the
true
reason
of
this
difference
when
mother
hohlfelder
died
i
found
among
her
things
one
day
a
little
packet
carefully
wrapped
up
containing
a
child
slip
and
some
trinkets
the
paper
wrapper
of
the
packet
bore
an
inscription
that
awakened
my
curiosity
i
asked
father
hohlfelder
whose
the
things
had
been
and
then
for
the
first
time
i
learned
my
real
story
i
was
not
their
own
daughter
he
stated
but
an
adopted
child
years
ago
when
he
had
lived
in
louis
a
steamboat
explosion
had
occurred
up
the
river
and
on
a
piece
of
wreckage
floating
down
stream
a
girl
baby
had
been
found
there
was
nothing
on
the
child
to
give
a
hint
of
its
home
or
parentage
and
no
one
came
to
claim
it
though
the
fact
that
a
child
had
been
found
was
advertised
all
along
the
river
it
was
believed
that
the
infant
parents
must
have
perished
in
the
wreck
and
certainly
no
one
of
those
who
were
saved
could
identify
the
child
there
had
been
a
passenger
list
on
board
the
steamer
but
the
list
with
the
officer
who
kept
it
had
been
lost
in
the
accident
the
child
was
turned
over
to
an
orphan
asylum
from
which
within
a
year
it
was
adopted
by
the
two
and
childless
german
people
who
brought
it
up
as
their
own
i
was
that
child
the
woman
seated
by
clara
side
had
listened
with
strained
attention
did
you
learn
the
name
of
the
steamboat
she
asked
quietly
but
quickly
when
clara
paused
the
pride
of
louis
answered
clara
she
did
not
look
at
harper
but
was
gazing
dreamily
toward
the
front
and
therefore
did
not
see
the
expression
that
sprang
into
the
other
face
a
look
in
which
hope
struggled
with
fear
and
yearning
love
with
both
nor
the
strong
effort
with
which
harper
controlled
herself
and
moved
not
one
muscle
while
the
other
went
on
i
was
never
sought
clara
continued
and
the
good
people
who
brought
me
up
gave
me
every
care
father
and
mother
i
can
never
train
my
tongue
to
call
them
anything
else
were
very
good
to
me
when
they
adopted
me
they
were
poor
he
was
a
pharmacist
with
a
small
shop
later
on
he
moved
to
cincinnati
where
he
made
and
sold
a
popular
medicine
and
amassed
a
fortune
then
i
went
to
a
fashionable
school
was
taught
french
and
deportment
and
dancing
father
hohlfelder
made
some
bad
investments
and
lost
most
of
his
money
the
patent
medicine
fell
off
in
popularity
a
year
or
two
ago
we
came
to
this
city
to
live
father
bought
this
block
and
opened
the
little
drug
store
below
we
moved
into
the
rooms
upstairs
the
business
was
poor
and
i
felt
that
i
ought
to
do
something
to
earn
money
and
help
support
the
family
i
could
dance
we
had
this
hall
and
it
was
not
rented
all
the
time
so
i
opened
a
tell
me
child
said
the
other
woman
with
restrained
eagerness
what
were
the
things
found
upon
you
when
you
were
taken
from
the
river
yes
answered
the
girl
i
will
but
i
have
not
told
you
all
my
story
for
this
is
but
the
prelude
about
a
year
ago
a
young
doctor
rented
an
office
in
our
block
we
met
each
other
at
first
only
now
and
then
and
afterwards
oftener
and
six
months
ago
he
told
me
that
he
loved
me
she
paused
and
sat
with
half
opened
lips
and
dreamy
eyes
looking
back
into
the
past
six
months
and
the
things
found
upon
you
yes
i
will
show
them
to
you
when
you
have
heard
all
my
story
he
wanted
to
marry
me
and
has
asked
me
every
week
since
i
have
told
him
that
i
love
him
but
i
have
not
said
i
would
marry
him
i
do
think
it
would
be
right
for
me
to
do
so
unless
i
could
clear
up
this
mystery
i
believe
he
is
going
to
be
great
and
rich
and
famous
and
there
might
come
a
time
when
he
would
be
ashamed
of
me
i
do
say
that
i
shall
never
marry
him
for
i
have
hoped
i
have
a
presentiment
that
in
some
strange
way
i
shall
find
out
who
i
am
and
who
my
parents
were
it
may
be
mere
imagination
on
my
part
but
somehow
i
believe
it
is
more
than
that
are
you
sure
there
was
no
mark
on
the
things
that
were
found
upon
you
said
the
elder
woman
ah
yes
sighed
clara
i
am
sure
for
i
have
looked
at
them
a
hundred
times
they
tell
me
nothing
and
yet
they
suggest
to
me
many
things
come
she
said
taking
the
other
by
the
hand
and
i
will
show
them
to
you
she
led
the
way
along
the
hall
to
her
and
to
her
bedchamber
beyond
it
was
a
small
room
hung
with
paper
showing
a
pattern
of
on
a
light
ground
with
dotted
muslin
curtains
a
white
iron
bedstead
a
few
prints
on
the
wall
a
a
very
dainty
room
she
went
to
the
maple
and
opened
one
of
the
drawers
as
they
stood
for
a
moment
the
mirror
reflecting
and
framing
their
image
more
than
one
point
of
resemblance
between
them
was
emphasized
there
was
something
of
the
same
oval
face
and
in
clara
hair
a
faint
suggestion
of
the
wave
in
the
older
woman
and
though
clara
was
fairer
of
complexion
and
her
eyes
were
gray
and
the
other
black
there
was
visible
under
the
influence
of
the
momentary
excitement
one
of
those
indefinable
likenesses
which
are
at
times
encountered
sometimes
marking
blood
relationship
sometimes
the
impress
of
a
common
training
in
one
case
perhaps
a
mere
earmark
of
temperament
and
in
another
the
index
of
a
type
except
for
the
difference
in
color
one
might
imagine
that
if
the
younger
woman
were
twenty
years
older
the
resemblance
would
be
still
more
apparent
clara
reached
her
hand
into
the
drawer
and
drew
out
a
folded
packet
which
she
unwrapped
harper
following
her
movements
meanwhile
with
a
suppressed
intensity
of
interest
which
clara
had
she
not
been
absorbed
in
her
own
thoughts
could
not
have
failed
to
observe
when
the
last
fold
of
paper
was
removed
there
lay
revealed
a
muslin
slip
clara
lifted
it
and
shook
it
gently
until
it
was
unfolded
before
their
eyes
the
lower
half
was
delicately
worked
in
a
lacelike
pattern
revealing
an
immense
amount
of
patient
labor
the
elder
woman
seized
the
slip
with
hands
which
could
not
disguise
their
trembling
scanning
the
garment
carefully
she
seemed
to
be
noting
the
pattern
of
the
needlework
and
then
pointing
to
a
certain
spot
exclaimed
i
thought
so
i
was
sure
of
it
do
you
not
see
the
letters
oh
how
wonderful
clara
seized
the
slip
in
turn
and
scanned
the
monogram
how
strange
that
you
should
see
that
at
once
and
that
i
should
not
have
discovered
it
who
have
looked
at
it
a
hundred
times
and
here
she
added
opening
a
small
package
which
had
been
inclosed
in
the
other
is
my
coral
necklace
perhaps
your
keen
eyes
can
find
something
in
that
it
was
a
simple
trinket
at
which
the
older
woman
gave
but
a
glance
a
glance
that
added
to
her
emotion
listen
child
she
said
laying
her
trembling
hand
on
the
other
arm
it
is
all
very
strange
and
wonderful
for
that
slip
and
necklace
and
now
that
i
have
seen
them
your
face
and
your
voice
and
your
ways
all
tell
me
who
you
are
your
eyes
are
your
father
eyes
your
voice
is
your
father
voice
the
slip
was
worked
by
your
mother
hand
oh
cried
clara
and
for
a
moment
the
whole
world
swam
before
her
eyes
i
was
on
the
pride
of
louis
and
i
knew
your
father
and
your
mother
clara
pale
with
excitement
burst
into
tears
and
would
have
fallen
had
not
the
other
woman
caught
her
in
her
arms
harper
placed
her
on
the
couch
and
seated
by
her
side
supported
her
head
on
her
shoulder
her
hands
seemed
to
caress
the
young
woman
with
every
touch
tell
me
oh
tell
me
all
clara
demanded
when
the
first
wave
of
emotion
had
subsided
who
were
my
father
and
my
mother
and
who
am
i
the
elder
woman
restrained
her
emotion
with
an
effort
and
answered
as
composedly
as
she
could
there
were
several
hundred
passengers
on
the
pride
of
louis
when
she
left
cincinnati
on
that
fateful
day
on
her
regular
trip
to
new
orleans
your
father
and
mother
were
on
the
boat
and
i
was
on
the
boat
we
were
going
down
the
river
to
take
ship
at
new
orleans
for
france
a
country
which
your
father
loved
who
was
my
father
asked
clara
the
woman
words
fell
upon
her
ear
like
water
on
a
thirsty
soil
your
father
was
a
virginia
gentleman
and
belonged
to
one
of
the
first
families
the
staffords
of
melton
county
clara
drew
herself
up
unconsciously
and
into
her
face
there
came
a
frank
expression
of
pride
which
became
it
wonderfully
setting
off
a
beauty
that
needed
only
this
to
make
it
all
but
perfect
of
its
type
i
knew
it
must
be
so
she
murmured
i
have
often
felt
it
blood
will
always
tell
and
my
mother
your
mother
also
belonged
to
one
of
the
first
families
of
virginia
and
in
her
veins
flowed
some
of
the
best
blood
of
the
old
dominion
what
was
her
maiden
name
mary
fairfax
as
i
was
saying
your
father
was
a
virginia
gentleman
he
was
as
handsome
a
man
as
ever
lived
and
proud
oh
so
proud
and
good
and
kind
he
was
a
graduate
of
the
university
and
had
studied
abroad
my
mother
was
she
beautiful
she
was
much
admired
and
your
father
loved
her
from
the
moment
he
first
saw
her
your
father
came
back
from
europe
upon
his
sudden
death
and
entered
upon
his
inheritance
but
he
had
been
away
from
virginia
so
long
and
had
read
so
many
books
that
he
had
outgrown
his
home
he
did
not
believe
that
slavery
was
right
and
one
of
the
first
things
he
did
was
to
free
his
slaves
his
views
were
not
popular
and
he
sold
out
his
lands
a
year
before
the
war
with
the
intention
of
moving
to
europe
in
the
mean
time
he
had
met
and
loved
and
married
my
mother
in
the
mean
time
he
had
met
and
loved
your
mother
my
mother
was
a
virginia
belle
was
she
not
the
fairfaxes
answered
harper
were
the
first
of
the
first
families
the
bluest
of
the
the
miss
fairfaxes
were
all
beautiful
and
all
social
favorites
what
did
my
father
do
then
when
he
had
sold
out
in
virginia
he
went
with
your
mother
and
you
you
were
then
just
a
year
old
to
cincinnati
to
settle
up
some
business
connected
with
his
estate
when
he
had
completed
his
business
he
embarked
on
the
pride
of
louis
with
you
and
your
mother
and
a
colored
nurse
and
how
did
you
know
about
them
asked
clara
i
was
one
of
the
party

was

colored
nurse

would
have
called
you
in
my
old
virginia
home

my
bosom

rested
my
breasts

you
nourishment

ministered
to
you
my
arms
sheltered
you
and
my
heart
loved
you
and
mourned
you
like
a
mother
loves
and
mourns
her
firstborn
oh
how
strange
how
delightful
exclaimed
clara
now
i
understand
why
you
clasped
me
so
tightly
and
were
so
agitated
when
i
told
you
my
story
it
is
too
good
for
me
to
believe
i
am
of
good
blood
of
an
old
and
aristocratic
family
my
presentiment
has
come
true

can
marry
my
lover

my
happiness
to
you

can
i
ever
repay

kiss
me

mammy
their
lips
met
and
they
were
clasped
in
each
other
arms

into
the
embrace
all
of
her
joy
the
other
all
the
suppressed
feeling
of
the
last
half
hour
which
in
turn
embodied
the
unsatisfied
yearning
of
many
years
the
music
had
ceased
and
the
pupils
had
left
the
hall
charges
had
supposed
her
gone
and
had
left
for
home
without
her
but
the
two
women
sitting
in
clara
chamber
hand
in
hand
were
oblivious
to
external
things
and
noticed
neither
the
hour
nor
the
cessation
of
the
music
why
dear
mammy
said
the
young
woman
musingly
did
you
not
find
me
and
restore
me
to
my
people
alas
child
i
was
not
white
and
when
i
was
picked
up
from
the
water
after
floating
miles
down
the
river
the
man
who
found
me
kept
me
prisoner
for
a
time
and
there
being
no
inquiry
for
me
pretended
not
to
believe
that
i
was
free
and
took
me
down
to
new
orleans
and
sold
me
as
a
slave
a
few
years
later
the
war
set
me
free
i
went
to
louis
but
could
find
no
trace
of
you
i
had
hardly
dared
to
hope
that
a
child
had
been
saved
when
so
many
grown
men
and
women
had
lost
their
lives
i
made
such
inquiries
as
i
could
but
all
in
vain
did
you
go
to
the
orphan
asylum
the
orphan
asylum
had
been
burned
and
with
it
all
the
records
the
war
had
scattered
the
people
so
that
i
could
find
no
one
who
knew
about
a
lost
child
saved
from
a
river
wreck
there
were
many
orphans
in
those
days
and
one
more
or
less
was
not
likely
to
dwell
in
the
public
mind
did
you
tell
my
people
in
virginia
they
too
were
scattered
by
the
war
your
uncles
lost
their
lives
on
the
battlefield
the
family
mansion
was
burned
to
the
ground
your
father
remaining
relatives
were
reduced
to
poverty
and
moved
away
from
virginia
what
of
my
mother
people
they
are
all
dead
god
punished
them
they
did
not
love
your
father
and
did
not
wish
him
to
marry
your
mother
they
helped
to
drive
him
to
his
death
i
am
alone
in
the
world
then
without
kith
or
kin
murmured
clara
and
yet
strange
to
say
i
am
happy
if
i
had
known
my
people
and
lost
them
i
should
be
sad
they
are
gone
but
they
have
left
me
their
name
and
their
blood
i
would
weep
for
my
poor
father
and
mother
if
i
were
not
so
glad
just
then
some
one
struck
a
chord
upon
the
piano
in
the
hall
and
the
sudden
breaking
of
the
stillness
recalled
clara
attention
to
the
lateness
of
the
hour
i
had
forgotten
about
the
class
she
exclaimed
i
must
go
and
attend
to
them
they
walked
along
the
corridor
and
entered
the
hall
winthrop
was
seated
at
the
piano
drumming
idly
on
the
keys
i
did
not
know
where
you
had
gone
he
said
i
knew
you
would
be
around
of
course
since
the
lights
were
not
out
and
so
i
came
in
here
to
wait
for
you
listen
john
i
have
a
wonderful
story
to
tell
you
then
she
told
him
harper
story
he
listened
attentively
and
sympathetically
at
certain
points
taking
his
eyes
from
clara
face
and
glancing
keenly
at
harper
who
was
listening
intently
as
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
he
noticed
the
resemblance
between
them
and
something
in
his
expression
caused
harper
eyes
to
fall
and
then
glance
up
appealingly
and
now
said
clara
i
am
happy
i
know
my
name
i
am
a
virginia
stafford
i
belong
to
one
yes
to
two
of
what
were
the
first
families
of
virginia
john
my
family
is
as
good
as
yours
if
i
remember
my
history
correctly
the
cavaliers
looked
down
upon
the
roundheads
i
admit
my
inferiority
he
replied
if
you
are
happy
i
am
glad
clara
stafford
mused
the
girl
it
is
a
pretty
name
you
will
never
have
to
use
it
her
lover
declared
for
now
you
will
take
mine
then
i
shall
have
nothing
left
of
all
that
i
have
found
except
your
husband
asserted
winthrop
putting
his
arm
around
her
with
an
air
of
assured
possession
harper
was
looking
at
them
with
moistened
eyes
in
which
joy
and
sorrow
love
and
gratitude
were
strangely
blended
clara
put
out
her
hand
to
her
impulsively
and
my
mammy
she
cried
my

branson
county
north
carolina
is
in
a
sequestered
district
of
one
of
the
staidest
and
most
conservative
states
of
the
union
society
in
branson
county
is
almost
primitive
in
its
simplicity
most
of
the
white
people
own
the
farms
they
till
and
even
before
the
war
there
were
no
very
wealthy
families
to
force
their
neighbors
by
comparison
into
the
category
of
poor
whites
to
branson
county
as
to
most
rural
communities
in
the
south
the
war
is
the
one
historical
event
that
overshadows
all
others
it
is
the
era
from
which
all
local
chronicles
are
dated
births
deaths
marriages
storms
freshets
no
description
of
the
life
of
any
southern
community
would
be
perfect
that
failed
to
emphasize
the
all
pervading
influence
of
the
great
conflict
yet
the
fierce
tide
of
war
that
had
rushed
through
the
cities
and
along
the
great
highways
of
the
country
had
comparatively
speaking
but
slightly
disturbed
the
sluggish
current
of
life
in
this
region
remote
from
railroads
and
navigable
streams
to
the
north
in
virginia
to
the
west
in
tennessee
and
all
along
the
seaboard
the
war
had
raged
but
the
thunder
of
its
cannon
had
not
disturbed
the
echoes
of
branson
county
where
the
loudest
sounds
heard
were
the
crack
of
some
hunter
rifle
the
baying
of
some
hound
or
the
yodel
of
some
tuneful
negro
on
his
way
through
the
pine
forest
to
the
east
sherman
army
had
passed
on
its
march
to
the
sea
but
no
straggling
band
of
bummers
had
penetrated
the
confines
of
branson
county
the
war
it
is
true
had
robbed
the
county
of
the
flower
of
its
young
manhood
but
the
burden
of
taxation
the
doubt
and
uncertainty
of
the
conflict
and
the
sting
of
ultimate
defeat
had
been
borne
by
the
people
with
an
apathy
that
robbed
misfortune
of
half
its
sharpness
the
nearest
approach
to
town
life
afforded
by
branson
county
is
found
in
the
little
village
of
troy
the
county
seat
a
hamlet
with
a
population
of
four
or
five
hundred
ten
years
make
little
difference
in
the
appearance
of
these
remote
southern
towns
if
a
railroad
is
built
through
one
of
them
it
infuses
some
enterprise
the
social
corpse
is
galvanized
by
the
fresh
blood
of
civilization
that
pulses
along
the
farthest
ramifications
of
our
great
system
of
commercial
highways
at
the
period
of
which
i
write
no
railroad
had
come
to
troy
if
a
traveler
accustomed
to
the
bustling
life
of
cities
could
have
ridden
through
troy
on
a
summer
day
he
might
easily
have
fancied
himself
in
a
deserted
village
around
him
he
would
have
seen
houses
innocent
of
paint
the
shingled
roofs
in
many
instances
covered
with
a
rich
growth
of
moss
here
and
there
he
would
have
met
a
hog
lazily
rooting
his
way
along
the
principal
thoroughfare
and
more
than
once
he
would
probably
have
had
to
disturb
the
slumbers
of
some
yellow
dog
dozing
away
the
hours
in
the
ardent
sunshine
and
reluctantly
yielding
up
his
place
in
the
middle
of
the
dusty
road
on
saturdays
the
village
presented
a
somewhat
livelier
appearance
and
the
shade
trees
around
the
court
house
square
and
along
front
street
served
as
for
a
goodly
number
of
horses
and
mules
and
stunted
oxen
belonging
to
the
who
had
come
in
to
trade
at
the
two
or
three
local
stores
a
murder
was
a
rare
event
in
branson
county
every
citizen
could
tell
the
number
of
homicides
committed
in
the
county
for
fifty
years
back
and
whether
the
slayer
in
any
given
instance
had
escaped
either
by
flight
or
acquittal
or
had
suffered
the
penalty
of
the
law
so
when
it
became
known
in
troy
early
one
friday
morning
in
summer
about
ten
years
after
the
war
that
old
captain
walker
who
had
served
in
mexico
under
scott
and
had
left
an
arm
on
the
field
of
gettysburg
had
been
foully
murdered
during
the
night
there
was
intense
excitement
in
the
village
business
was
practically
suspended
and
the
citizens
gathered
in
little
groups
to
discuss
the
murder
and
speculate
upon
the
identity
of
the
murderer
it
transpired
from
testimony
at
the
inquest
held
during
the
morning
that
a
strange
mulatto
had
been
seen
going
in
the
direction
of
captain
walker
house
the
night
before
and
had
been
met
going
away
from
troy
early
friday
morning
by
a
farmer
on
his
way
to
town
other
circumstances
seemed
to
connect
the
stranger
with
the
crime
the
sheriff
organized
a
posse
to
search
for
him
and
early
in
the
evening
when
most
of
the
citizens
of
troy
were
at
supper
the
suspected
man
was
brought
in
and
lodged
in
the
county
jail
by
the
following
morning
the
news
of
the
capture
had
spread
to
the
farthest
limits
of
the
county
a
much
larger
number
of
people
than
usual
came
to
town
that
saturday
bearded
men
in
straw
hats
and
blue
homespun
shirts
and
butternut
trousers
of
great
amplitude
of
material
and
vagueness
of
outline
women
in
homespun
frocks
and
with
faces
as
expressionless
as
the
dreary
sandhills
which
gave
them
a
meagre
sustenance
the
murder
was
almost
the
sole
topic
of
conversation
a
steady
stream
of
curious
observers
visited
the
house
of
mourning
and
gazed
upon
the
rugged
face
of
the
old
veteran
now
stiff
and
cold
in
death
and
more
than
one
eye
dropped
a
tear
at
the
remembrance
of
the
cheery
smile
and
the
joke
sometimes
superannuated
generally
feeble
but
always
with
which
the
captain
had
been
wont
to
greet
his
acquaintances
there
was
a
growing
sentiment
of
anger
among
these
stern
men
toward
the
murderer
who
had
thus
cut
down
their
friend
and
a
strong
feeling
that
ordinary
justice
was
too
slight
a
punishment
for
such
a
crime
toward
noon
there
was
an
informal
gathering
of
citizens
in
dan
store
i
hear
it
that
square
kyahtah
too
sick
ter
hol
this
evenin
said
one
an
that
the
hearin
haf
ter
go
over
nex
week
a
look
of
disappointment
went
round
the
crowd
hit
the
durndes
meanes
murder
ever
committed
in
this
caounty
said
another
with
moody
emphasis
i
the
nigger
the
had
some
observed
a
third
speaker
the
said
another
with
an
air
of
superior
information
has
left
two
bairls
of
confedrit
money
which
he
be
good
some
day
er
nuther
this
statement
gave
rise
to
a
discussion
of
the
speculative
value
of
confederate
money
but
in
a
little
while
the
conversation
returned
to
the
murder
hangin
air
too
good
fer
the
murderer
said
one
he
oughter
be
burnt
stidier
bein
hung
there
was
an
impressive
pause
at
this
point
during
which
a
jug
of
moonlight
whiskey
went
the
round
of
the
crowd
well
said
a
farmer
who
in
spite
of
his
peaceable
expression
and
faded
gray
eye
was
known
to
have
been
one
of
the
most
daring
followers
of
a
rebel
guerrilla
chieftain
what
air
yer
gwine
ter
do
about
it
ef
you
fellers
air
gwine
ter
set
down

nigger

the
bes
white
man
in
branson
an
not
say
nuthin
ner
do
nuthin
move
outen
the
caounty
this
speech
gave
tone
and
direction
to
the
rest
of
the
conversation
whether
the
fear
of
losing
the
farmer
operated
to
bring
about
the
result
or
not
is
immaterial
to
this
narrative
but
at
all
events
the
crowd
decided
to
lynch
the
negro
they
agreed
that
this
was
the
least
that
could
be
done
to
avenge
the
death
of
their
murdered
friend
and
that
it
was
a
becoming
way
in
which
to
honor
his
memory
they
had
some
vague
notions
of
the
majesty
of
the
law
and
the
rights
of
the
citizen
but
in
the
passion
of
the
moment
these
sunk
into
oblivion
a
white
man
had
been
killed
by
a
negro
the
was
an
ole
sodger
said
one
of
his
friends
solemnly
he
sleep
better
when
he
knows
that
a
has
hilt
jestice
done
by
agreement
the
lynchers
were
to
meet
at
tyson
store
at
five
in
the
afternoon
and
proceed
thence
to
the
jail
which
was
situated
down
the
lumberton
dirt
road
as
the
old
turnpike
antedating
the
was
called
about
half
a
mile
south
of
the
when
the
preliminaries
of
the
lynching
had
been
arranged
and
a
committee
appointed
to
manage
the
affair
the
crowd
dispersed
some
to
go
to
their
dinners
and
some
to
secure
recruits
for
the
lynching
party
it
was
twenty
minutes
to
five
when
an
excited
negro
panting
and
perspiring
rushed
up
to
the
back
door
of
sheriff
dwelling
which
stood
at
a
little
distance
from
the
jail
and
somewhat
farther
than
the
latter
building
from
the
a

the

went

and
a
moment
later
the
sheriff
came
to
the
door
he
was
a
tall
muscular
man
of
a
ruddier
complexion
than
is
usual
among
southerners
a
pair
of
keen
gray
eyes
looked
out
from
under
bushy
eyebrows
and
about
his
mouth
was
a
masterful
expression
which
a
full
beard
once
sandy
in
color
but
now
profusely
sprinkled
with
gray
could
not
entirely
conceal
the
day
was
hot
the
sheriff
had
discarded
his
coat
and
vest
and
had
his
white
shirt
open
at
the
throat

he
inquired
of

the
sheriff
listened
calmly
but
his
face
grew
firmer
and
a
determined
gleam
lit
up
his
gray
eyes
his
frame
grew
more
erect
and
he
unconsciously
assumed
the
attitude
of
a
soldier
who
momentarily
expects
to
meet
the
enemy

the

glanced
nervously
down
the
road
toward
the
town
and
made
a
movement
as
if
to
go
away
wo

have
some

asked
the
sheriff
the
negro
looked
longingly
in
at
the
open

and
sniffed
the
appetizing

a
huge
sandwich
of
split
with
a
thick
slice
of
fat
bacon
inserted
between
the
halves
and
a
couple
of
baked
yams
the
negro
hastily
replaced
his
ragged
hat
on
his
head
dropped
the
yams
in
the
pocket
of
his
capacious
trousers
and
taking
the
sandwich
in
his
hand
hurried
across
the
road
and
disappeared
in
the
woods
beyond
the
sheriff
reëntered
the
house
and
put
on
his
coat
and
hat
he
then
took
down
a
shotgun
and
loaded
it
with
buckshot
filling
the
chambers
of
a
revolver
with
fresh
cartridges
he
slipped
it
into
the
pocket
of
the
which
he
wore
a
comely
young
woman
in
a
calico
dress
watched
these
proceedings
with
anxious
surprise
where
are
you
going
father
she
asked
she
had
not
heard
the
conversation
with
the
negro
i
am
goin
over
to
the
jail
responded
the
sheriff
there
a
mob
comin
this
way
to
lynch
the
nigger
we
got
locked
up
but
they
do
it
he
added
with
emphasis
oh
father
do
go
pleaded
the
girl
clinging
to
his
arm
they
shoot
you
if
you
do
give
him
up
you
never
mind
me
polly
said
her
father
reassuringly
as
he
gently
unclasped
her
hands
from
his
arm
i
take
care
of
myself
and
the
prisoner
too
there
ai
a
man
in
branson
county
that
would
shoot
me
besides
i
have
faced
fire
too
often
to
be
scared
away
from
my
duty
you
keep
close
in
the
house
he
continued
and
if
any
one
disturbs
you
just
use
the
old
in
the
top
bureau
drawer
it
a
little
but
it
did
good
work
a
few
years
ago
the
young
girl
shuddered
at
this
sanguinary
allusion
but
made
no
further
objection
to
her
father
departure
the
sheriff
of
branson
was
a
man
far
above
the
average
of
the
community
in
wealth
education
and
social
position
his
had
been
one
of
the
few
families
in
the
county
that
before
the
war
had
owned
large
estates
and
numerous
slaves
he
had
graduated
at
the
state
university
at
chapel
hill
and
had
kept
up
some
acquaintance
with
current
literature
and
advanced
thought
he
had
traveled
some
in
his
youth
and
was
looked
up
to
in
the
county
as
an
authority
on
all
subjects
connected
with
the
outer
world
at
first
an
ardent
supporter
of
the
union
he
had
opposed
the
secession
movement
in
his
native
state
as
long
as
opposition
availed
to
stem
the
tide
of
public
opinion
yielding
at
last
to
the
force
of
circumstances
he
had
entered
the
confederate
service
rather
late
in
the
war
and
served
with
distinction
through
several
campaigns
rising
in
time
to
the
rank
of
colonel
after
the
war
he
had
taken
the
oath
of
allegiance
and
had
been
chosen
by
the
people
as
the
most
available
candidate
for
the
office
of
sheriff
to
which
he
had
been
elected
without
opposition
he
had
filled
the
office
for
several
terms
and
was
universally
popular
with
his
constituents
colonel
or
sheriff
campbell
as
he
was
indifferently
called
as
the
military
or
civil
title
happened
to
be
most
important
in
the
opinion
of
the
person
addressing
him
had
a
high
sense
of
the
responsibility
attaching
to
his
office
he
had
sworn
to
do
his
duty
faithfully
and
he
knew
what
his
duty
was
as
sheriff
perhaps
more
clearly
than
he
had
apprehended
it
in
other
passages
of
his
life
it
was
therefore
with
no
uncertainty
in
regard
to
his
course
that
he
prepared
his
weapons
and
went
over
to
the
jail
he
had
no
fears
for
polly
safety
the
sheriff
had
just
locked
the
heavy
front
door
of
the
jail
behind
him
when
a
half
dozen
horsemen
followed
by
a
crowd
of
men
on
foot
came
round
a
bend
in
the
road
and
drew
near
the
jail
they
halted
in
front
of
the
picket
fence
that
surrounded
the
building
while
several
of
the
committee
of
arrangements
rode
on
a
few
rods
farther
to
the
house
one
of
them
dismounted
and
rapped
on
the
door
with
his
is
the
sheriff
at
home
he
inquired
no
he
has
just
gone
out
replied
polly
who
had
come
to
the
door
we
want
the
jail
keys
he
continued
they
are
not
here
said
polly
the
sheriff
has
them
himself
then
she
added
with
assumed
indifference
he
is
at
the
jail
now
the
man
turned
away
and
polly
went
into
the
front
room
from
which
she
peered
anxiously
between
the
slats
of
the
green
blinds
of
a
window
that
looked
toward
the
jail
meanwhile
the
messenger
returned
to
his
companions
and
announced
his
discovery
it
looked
as
though
the
sheriff
had
learned
of
their
design
and
was
preparing
to
resist
it
one
of
them
stepped
forward
and
rapped
on
the
jail
door
well
what
is
it
said
the
sheriff
from
within
we
want
to
talk
to
you
sheriff
replied
the
spokesman
there
was
a
little
wicket
in
the
door
this
the
sheriff
opened
and
answered
through
it
all
right
boys
talk
away
you
are
all
strangers
to
me
and
i
know
what
business
you
can
have
the
sheriff
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
recognize
anybody
in
particular
on
such
an
occasion
the
question
of
identity
sometimes
comes
up
in
the
investigation
of
these
executions
we
a
committee
of
citizens
and
we
want
to
get
into
the
jail
what
for
it
ai
much
trouble
to
get
into
jail
most
people
want
to
keep
out
the
mob
was
in
no
humor
to
appreciate
a
joke
and
the
witticism
fell
dead
upon
an
unresponsive
audience
we
want
to
have
a
talk
with
the
nigger
that
killed
walker
you
can
talk
to
that
nigger
in
the
when
he
brought
out
for
trial
court
will
be
in
session
here
next
week
i
know
what
you
fellows
want
but
you
ca
get
my
prisoner
do
you
want
to
take
the
bread
out
of
a
poor
man
mouth
i
get
cents
a
day
for
keeping
this
prisoner
and
he
the
only
one
in
jail
i
ca
have
my
family
suffer
just
to
please
you
fellows
one
or
two
young
men
in
the
crowd
laughed
at
the
idea
of
sheriff
campbell
suffering
for
want
of
cents
a
day
but
they
were
frowned
into
silence
by
those
who
stood
near
them
ef
yer
do
let
us
in
cried
a
voice
we
bu
the
do
open
bust
away
answered
the
sheriff
raising
his
voice
so
that
all
could
hear
but
i
give
you
fair
warning
the
first
man
that
tries
it
will
be
filled
with
buckshot
i
sheriff
of
this
county
i
know
my
duty
and
i
mean
to
do
it
what
the
use
of
kicking
sheriff
argued
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
mob
the
nigger
is
sure
to
hang
anyhow
he
richly
deserves
it
and
we
got
to
do
something
to
teach
the
niggers
their
places
or
white
people
wo
be
able
to
live
in
the
county
there
no
use
talking
boys
responded
the
sheriff
i
a
white
man
outside
but
in
this
jail
i
sheriff
and
if
this
nigger
to
be
hung
in
this
county
i
propose
to
do
the
hanging
so
you
fellows
might
as
well
and
march
back
to
troy
you
had
a
pleasant
trip
and
the
exercise
will
be
good
for
you
you
know
i
got
powder
and
ball
and
i
faced
fire
before
now
with
nothing
between
me
and
the
enemy
and
i
do
mean
to
surrender
this
jail
while
i
able
to
shoot
having
thus
announced
his
determination
the
sheriff
closed
and
fastened
the
wicket
and
looked
around
for
the
best
position
from
which
to
defend
the
building
the
crowd
drew
off
a
little
and
the
leaders
conversed
together
in
low
tones
the
branson
county
jail
was
a
small
brick
building
strongly
constructed
with
no
attempt
at
architectural
ornamentation
each
story
was
divided
into
two
large
cells
by
a
passage
running
from
front
to
rear
a
grated
iron
door
gave
entrance
from
the
passage
to
each
of
the
four
cells
the
jail
seldom
had
many
prisoners
in
it
and
the
lower
windows
had
been
boarded
up
when
the
sheriff
had
closed
the
wicket
he
ascended
the
steep
wooden
stairs
to
the
upper
floor
there
was
no
window
at
the
front
of
the
upper
passage
and
the
most
available
position
from
which
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
crowd
below
was
the
front
window
of
the
cell
occupied
by
the
solitary
prisoner
the
sheriff
unlocked
the
door
and
entered
the
cell
the
prisoner
was
crouched
in
a
corner
his
yellow
face
blanched
with
terror
looking
ghastly
in
the
of
the
room
a
cold
perspiration
had
gathered
on
his
forehead
and
his
teeth
were
chattering
with
affright
for
god
sake
sheriff
he
murmured
hoarsely
do
let
lynch
me
i
did
kill
the
old
man
the
sheriff
glanced
at
the
cowering
wretch
with
a
look
of
mingled
contempt
and
loathing
get
up
he
said
sharply
you
will
probably
be
hung
sooner
or
later
but
it
shall
not
be
if
i
can
help
it
i
unlock
your
fetters
and
if
i
ca
hold
the
jail
you
have
to
make
the
best
fight
you
can
if
i
shot
i
consider
my
responsibility
at
an
end
there
were
iron
fetters
on
the
prisoner
ankles
and
handcuffs
on
his
wrists
these
the
sheriff
unlocked
and
they
fell
clanking
to
the
floor
keep
back
from
the
window
said
the
sheriff
they
might
shoot
if
they
saw
you
the
sheriff
drew
toward
the
window
a
pine
bench
which
formed
a
part
of
the
scanty
furniture
of
the
cell
and
laid
his
revolver
upon
it
then
he
took
his
gun
in
hand
and
took
his
stand
at
the
side
of
the
window
where
he
could
with
least
exposure
of
himself
watch
the
movements
of
the
crowd
below
the
lynchers
had
not
anticipated
any
determined
resistance
of
course
they
had
looked
for
a
formal
protest
and
perhaps
a
sufficient
show
of
opposition
to
excuse
the
sheriff
in
the
eye
of
any
stickler
for
legal
formalities
they
had
not
however
come
prepared
to
fight
a
battle
and
no
one
of
them
seemed
willing
to
lead
an
attack
upon
the
jail
the
leaders
of
the
party
conferred
together
with
a
good
deal
of
animated
gesticulation
which
was
visible
to
the
sheriff
from
his
outlook
though
the
distance
was
too
great
for
him
to
hear
what
was
said
at
length
one
of
them
broke
away
from
the
group
and
rode
back
to
the
main
body
of
the
lynchers
who
were
restlessly
awaiting
orders
well
boys
said
the
messenger
we
have
to
let
it
go
for
the
present
the
sheriff
says
he
shoot
and
he
got
the
drop
on
us
this
time
there
ai
any
of
us
that
want
to
follow
walker
jest
yet
besides
the
sheriff
is
a
good
fellow
and
we
do
want
to
hurt
but
he
added
as
if
to
reassure
the
crowd
which
began
to
show
signs
of
disappointment
the
nigger
might
as
well
say
his
prayers
for
he
ai
got
long
to
live
there
was
a
murmur
of
dissent
from
the
mob
and
several
voices
insisted
that
an
attack
be
made
on
the
jail
but
pacific
counsels
finally
prevailed
and
the
mob
sullenly
withdrew
the
sheriff
stood
at
the
window
until
they
had
disappeared
around
the
bend
in
the
road
he
did
not
relax
his
watchfulness
when
the
last
one
was
out
of
sight
their
withdrawal
might
be
a
mere
feint
to
be
followed
by
a
further
attempt
so
closely
indeed
was
his
attention
drawn
to
the
outside
that
he
neither
saw
nor
heard
the
prisoner
creep
stealthily
across
the
floor
reach
out
his
hand
and
secure
the
revolver
which
lay
on
the
bench
behind
the
sheriff
and
creep
as
noiselessly
back
to
his
place
in
the
corner
of
the
room
a
moment
after
the
last
of
the
lynching
party
had
disappeared
there
was
a
shot
fired
from
the
woods
across
the
road
a
bullet
whistled
by
the
window
and
buried
itself
in
the
wooden
casing
a
few
inches
from
where
the
sheriff
was
standing
quick
as
thought
with
the
instinct
born
of
a
army
experience
he
raised
his
gun
and
fired
twice
at
the
point
from
which
a
faint
puff
of
smoke
showed
the
hostile
bullet
to
have
been
sent
he
stood
a
moment
watching
and
then
rested
his
gun
against
the
window
and
reached
behind
him
mechanically
for
the
other
weapon
it
was
not
on
the
bench
as
the
sheriff
realized
this
fact
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
into
the
muzzle
of
the
revolver
stay
where
you
are
sheriff
said
the
prisoner
his
eyes
glistening
his
face
almost
ruddy
with
excitement
the
sheriff
mentally
cursed
his
own
carelessness
for
allowing
him
to
be
caught
in
such
a
predicament
he
had
not
expected
anything
of
the
kind
he
had
relied
on
the
negro
cowardice
and
subordination
in
the
presence
of
an
armed
white
man
as
a
matter
of
course
the
sheriff
was
a
brave
man
but
realized
that
the
prisoner
had
him
at
an
immense
disadvantage
the
two
men
stood
thus
for
a
moment
fighting
a
harmless
duel
with
their
eyes
well
what
do
you
mean
to
do
asked
the
sheriff
with
apparent
calmness
to
get
away
of
course
said
the
prisoner
in
a
tone
which
caused
the
sheriff
to
look
at
him
more
closely
and
with
an
involuntary
feeling
of
apprehension
if
the
man
was
not
mad
he
was
in
a
state
of
mind
akin
to
madness
and
quite
as
dangerous
the
sheriff
felt
that
he
must
speak
the
prisoner
fair
and
watch
for
a
chance
to
turn
the
tables
on
him
the
desperate
man
before
him
was
a
different
being
altogether
from
the
groveling
wretch
who
had
begged
so
piteously
for
life
a
few
minutes
before
at
length
the
sheriff
spoke
is
this
your
gratitude
to
me
for
saving
your
life
at
the
risk
of
my
own
if
i
had
not
done
so
you
would
now
be
swinging
from
the
limb
of
some
neighboring
tree
true
said
the
prisoner
you
saved
my
life
but
for
how
long
when
you
came
in
you
said
court
would
sit
next
week
when
the
crowd
went
away
they
said
i
had
not
long
to
live
it
is
merely
a
choice
of
two
ropes
while
there
life
there
hope
replied
the
sheriff
he
uttered
this
commonplace
mechanically
while
his
brain
was
busy
in
trying
to
think
out
some
way
of
escape
if
you
are
innocent
you
can
prove
it
the
mulatto
kept
his
eye
upon
the
sheriff
i
did
kill
the
old
man
he
replied
but
i
shall
never
be
able
to
clear
myself
i
was
at
his
house
at
nine
i
stole
from
it
the
coat
that
was
on
my
back
when
i
was
taken
i
would
be
convicted
even
with
a
fair
trial
unless
the
real
murderer
were
discovered
beforehand
the
sheriff
knew
this
only
too
well
while
he
was
thinking
what
argument
next
to
use
the
prisoner
continued
throw
me
the
keys
no
unlock
the
door
the
sheriff
stood
a
moment
irresolute
the
mulatto
eye
glittered
ominously
the
sheriff
crossed
the
room
and
unlocked
the
door
leading
into
the
passage
now
go
down
and
unlock
the
outside
door
the
heart
of
the
sheriff
leaped
within
him
perhaps
he
might
make
a
dash
for
liberty
and
gain
the
outside
he
descended
the
narrow
stairs
the
prisoner
keeping
close
behind
him
the
sheriff
inserted
the
huge
iron
key
into
the
lock
the
rusty
bolt
yielded
slowly
it
still
remained
for
him
to
pull
the
door
open
stop
thundered
the
mulatto
who
seemed
to
divine
the
purpose
move
a
muscle
and
i
blow
your
brains
out
the
sheriff
obeyed
he
realized
that
his
chance
had
not
yet
come
now
keep
on
that
side
of
the
passage
and
go
back
upstairs
keeping
the
sheriff
under
cover
of
the
revolver
the
mulatto
followed
him
up
the
stairs
the
sheriff
expected
the
prisoner
to
lock
him
into
the
cell
and
make
his
own
escape
he
had
about
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
best
thing
he
could
do
under
the
circumstances
was
to
submit
quietly
and
take
his
chances
of
recapturing
the
prisoner
after
the
alarm
had
been
given
the
sheriff
had
faced
death
more
than
once
upon
the
battlefield
a
few
minutes
before
well
armed
and
with
a
brick
wall
between
him
and
them
he
had
dared
a
hundred
men
to
fight
but
he
felt
instinctively
that
the
desperate
man
confronting
him
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
and
he
was
too
prudent
a
man
to
risk
his
life
against
such
heavy
odds
he
had
polly
to
look
after
and
there
was
a
limit
beyond
which
devotion
to
duty
would
be
quixotic
and
even
foolish
i
want
to
get
away
said
the
prisoner
and
i
do
want
to
be
captured
for
if
i
am
i
know
i
will
be
hung
on
the
spot
i
am
afraid
he
added
somewhat
reflectively
that
in
order
to
save
myself
i
shall
have
to
kill
you
good
god
exclaimed
the
sheriff
in
involuntary
terror
you
would
not
kill
the
man
to
whom
you
owe
your
own
life
you
speak
more
truly
than
you
know
replied
the
mulatto
i
indeed
owe
my
life
to
you
the
sheriff
started
he
was
capable
of
surprise
even
in
that
moment
of
extreme
peril
who
are
you
he
asked
in
amazement
tom
cicely
son
returned
the
other
he
had
closed
the
door
and
stood
talking
to
the
sheriff
through
the
grated
opening
do
you
remember
cicely
cicely
whom
you
sold
with
her
child
to
the
speculator
on
his
way
to
alabama
the
sheriff
did
remember
he
had
been
sorry
for
it
many
a
time
since
it
had
been
the
old
story
of
debts
mortgages
and
bad
crops
he
had
quarreled
with
the
mother
the
price
offered
for
her
and
her
child
had
been
unusually
large
and
he
had
yielded
to
the
combination
of
anger
and
pecuniary
stress
good
god
he
gasped
you
would
not
murder
your
own
father
my
father
replied
the
mulatto
it
were
well
enough
for
me
to
claim
the
relationship
but
it
comes
with
poor
grace
from
you
to
ask
anything
by
reason
of
it
what
father
duty
have
you
ever
performed
for
me
did
you
give
me
your
name
or
even
your
protection
other
white
men
gave
their
colored
sons
freedom
and
money
and
sent
them
to
the
free
states
sold
to
the
rice
swamps
i
at
least
gave
you
the
life
you
cling
to
murmured
the
sheriff
life
said
the
prisoner
with
a
sarcastic
laugh
what
kind
of
a
life
you
gave
me
your
own
blood
your
own
features
no
man
need
look
at
us
together
twice
to
see
that
and
you
gave
me
a
black
mother
poor
wretch
she
died
under
the
lash
because
she
had
enough
womanhood
to
call
her
soul
her
own
you
gave
me
a
white
man
spirit
and
you
made
me
a
slave
and
crushed
it
out
but
you
are
free
now
said
the
sheriff
he
had
not
doubted
could
not
doubt
the
mulatto
word
he
knew
whose
passions
coursed
beneath
that
swarthy
skin
and
burned
in
the
black
eyes
opposite
his
own
he
saw
in
this
mulatto
what
he
himself
might
have
become
had
not
the
safeguards
of
parental
restraint
and
public
opinion
been
thrown
around
him
free
to
do
what
replied
the
mulatto
free
in
name
but
despised
and
scorned
and
set
aside
by
the
people
to
whose
race
i
belong
far
more
than
to
my
mother
there
are
schools
said
the
sheriff
you
have
been
to
school
he
had
noticed
that
the
mulatto
spoke
more
eloquently
and
used
better
language
than
most
branson
county
people
i
have
been
to
school
and
dreamed
when
i
went
that
it
would
work
some
marvelous
change
in
my
condition
but
what
did
i
learn
i
learned
to
feel
that
no
degree
of
learning
or
wisdom
will
change
the
color
of
my
skin
and
that
i
shall
always
wear
what
in
my
own
country
is
a
badge
of
degradation
when
i
think
about
it
seriously
i
do
not
care
particularly
for
such
a
life
it
is
the
animal
in
me
not
the
man
that
flees
the
gallows
i
owe
you
nothing
he
went
on
and
expect
nothing
of
you
and
it
would
be
no
more
than
justice
if
i
should
avenge
upon
you
my
wrongs
and
my
own
but
still
i
hate
to
shoot
you
i
have
never
yet
taken
human
life
for
i
did
kill
the
old
captain
will
you
promise
to
give
no
alarm
and
make
no
attempt
to
capture
me
until
morning
if
i
do
not
shoot
so
absorbed
were
the
two
men
in
their
colloquy
and
their
own
tumultuous
thoughts
that
neither
of
them
had
heard
the
door
below
move
upon
its
hinges
neither
of
them
had
heard
a
light
step
come
stealthily
up
the
stairs
nor
seen
a
slender
form
creep
along
the
darkening
passage
toward
the
mulatto
the
sheriff
hesitated
the
struggle
between
his
love
of
life
and
his
sense
of
duty
was
a
terrific
one
it
may
seem
strange
that
a
man
who
could
sell
his
own
child
into
slavery
should
hesitate
at
such
a
moment
when
his
life
was
trembling
in
the
balance
but
the
baleful
influence
of
human
slavery
poisoned
the
very
fountains
of
life
and
created
new
standards
of
right
the
sheriff
was
conscientious
his
conscience
had
merely
been
warped
by
his
environment
let
no
one
ask
what
his
answer
would
have
been
he
was
spared
the
necessity
of
a
decision
stop
said
the
mulatto
you
need
not
promise
i
could
not
trust
you
if
you
did
it
is
your
life
for
mine
there
is
but
one
safe
way
for
me
you
must
die
he
raised
his
arm
to
fire
when
there
was
a
flash
a
report
from
the
passage
behind
him
his
arm
fell
heavily
at
his
side
and
the
pistol
dropped
at
his
feet
the
sheriff
recovered
first
from
his
surprise
and
throwing
open
the
door
secured
the
fallen
weapon
then
seizing
the
prisoner
he
thrust
him
into
the
cell
and
locked
the
door
upon
him
after
which
he
turned
to
polly
who
leaned
against
the
wall
her
hands
clasped
over
her
heart
oh
father
i
was
just
in
time
she
cried
hysterically
and
wildly
sobbing
threw
herself
into
her
father
arms
i
watched
until
they
all
went
away
she
said
i
heard
the
shot
from
the
woods
and
i
saw
you
shoot
then
when
you
did
not
come
out
i
feared
something
had
happened
that
perhaps
you
had
been
wounded
i
got
out
the
other
pistol
and
ran
over
here
when
i
found
the
door
open
i
knew
something
was
wrong
and
when
i
heard
voices
i
crept
upstairs
and
reached
the
top
just
in
time
to
hear
him
say
he
would
kill
you
oh
it
was
a
narrow
escape
when
she
had
grown
somewhat
calmer
the
sheriff
left
her
standing
there
and
went
back
into
the
cell
the
prisoner
arm
was
bleeding
from
a
flesh
wound
his
bravado
had
given
place
to
a
stony
apathy
there
was
no
sign
in
his
face
of
fear
or
disappointment
or
feeling
of
any
kind
the
sheriff
sent
polly
to
the
house
for
cloth
and
bound
up
the
wound
with
a
rude
skill
acquired
during
his
army
life
i
have
a
doctor
come
and
dress
the
wound
in
the
morning
he
said
to
the
prisoner
it
will
do
very
well
until
then
if
you
will
keep
quiet
if
the
doctor
asks
you
how
the
wound
was
caused
you
can
say
that
you
were
struck
by
the
bullet
fired
from
the
woods
it
would
do
you
no
good
to
have
it
known
that
you
were
shot
while
attempting
to
escape
the
prisoner
uttered
no
word
of
thanks
or
apology
but
sat
in
sullen
silence
when
the
wounded
arm
had
been
bandaged
polly
and
her
father
returned
to
the
house
the
sheriff
was
in
an
unusually
thoughtful
mood
that
evening
he
put
salt
in
his
coffee
at
supper
and
poured
vinegar
over
his
pancakes
to
many
of
polly
questions
he
returned
random
answers
when
he
had
gone
to
bed
he
lay
awake
for
several
hours
in
the
silent
watches
of
the
night
when
he
was
alone
with
god
there
came
into
his
mind
a
flood
of
unaccustomed
thoughts
an
hour
or
two
before
standing
face
to
face
with
death
he
had
experienced
a
sensation
similar
to
that
which
drowning
men
are
said
to
feel
a
kind
of
clarifying
of
the
moral
faculty
in
which
the
veil
of
the
flesh
with
its
obscuring
passions
and
prejudices
is
pushed
aside
for
a
moment
and
all
the
acts
of
one
life
stand
out
in
the
clear
light
of
truth
in
their
correct
proportions
and
relations
a
state
of
mind
in
which
one
sees
himself
as
god
may
be
supposed
to
see
him
in
the
reaction
following
his
rescue
this
feeling
had
given
place
for
a
time
to
far
different
emotions
but
now
in
the
silence
of
midnight
something
of
this
clearness
of
spirit
returned
to
the
sheriff
he
saw
that
he
had
owed
some
duty
to
this
son
of
his
that
neither
law
nor
custom
could
destroy
a
responsibility
inherent
in
the
nature
of
mankind
he
could
not
thus
in
the
eyes
of
god
at
least
shake
off
the
consequences
of
his
sin
had
he
never
sinned
this
wayward
spirit
would
never
have
come
back
from
the
vanished
past
to
haunt
him
as
these
thoughts
came
his
anger
against
the
mulatto
died
away
and
in
its
place
there
sprang
up
a
great
pity
the
hand
of
parental
authority
might
have
restrained
the
passions
he
had
seen
burning
in
the
prisoner
eyes
when
the
desperate
man
spoke
the
words
which
had
seemed
to
doom
his
father
to
death
the
sheriff
felt
that
he
might
have
saved
this
fiery
spirit
from
the
slough
of
slavery
that
he
might
have
sent
him
to
the
free
north
and
given
him
there
or
in
some
other
land
an
opportunity
to
turn
to
usefulness
and
honorable
pursuits
the
talents
that
had
run
to
crime
perhaps
to
madness
he
might
still
less
have
given
this
son
of
his
the
poor
simulacrum
of
liberty
which
men
of
his
caste
could
possess
in
a
community
or
least
of
all
but
still
something
he
might
have
kept
the
boy
on
the
plantation
where
the
burdens
of
slavery
would
have
fallen
lightly
upon
him
the
sheriff
recalled
his
own
youth
he
had
inherited
an
honored
name
to
keep
untarnished
he
had
had
a
future
to
make
the
picture
of
a
fair
young
bride
had
beckoned
him
on
to
happiness
the
poor
wretch
now
stretched
upon
a
pallet
of
straw
between
the
brick
walls
of
the
jail
had
had
none
of
these
things
no
name
no
father
no
mother
in
the
true
meaning
of
motherhood
and
until
the
past
few
years
no
possible
future
and
then
one
vague
and
shadowy
in
its
outline
and
dependent
for
form
and
substance
upon
the
slow
solution
of
a
problem
in
which
there
were
many
unknown
quantities
from
what
he
might
have
done
to
what
he
might
yet
do
was
an
easy
transition
for
the
awakened
conscience
of
the
sheriff
it
occurred
to
him
purely
as
a
hypothesis
that
he
might
permit
his
prisoner
to
escape
but
his
oath
of
office
his
duty
as
sheriff
stood
in
the
way
of
such
a
course
and
the
sheriff
dismissed
the
idea
from
his
mind
he
could
however
investigate
the
circumstances
of
the
murder
and
move
heaven
and
earth
to
discover
the
real
criminal
for
he
no
longer
doubted
the
prisoner
innocence
he
could
employ
counsel
for
the
accused
and
perhaps
influence
public
opinion
in
his
favor
an
acquittal
once
secured
some
plan
could
be
devised
by
which
the
sheriff
might
in
some
degree
atone
for
his
crime
against
this
son
of
his
against
society
against
god
when
the
sheriff
had
reached
this
conclusion
he
fell
into
an
unquiet
slumber
from
which
he
awoke
late
the
next
morning
he
went
over
to
the
jail
before
breakfast
and
found
the
prisoner
lying
on
his
pallet
his
face
turned
to
the
wall
he
did
not
move
when
the
sheriff
rattled
the
door
said
the
latter
in
a
tone
intended
to
waken
the
prisoner
there
was
no
response
the
sheriff
looked
more
keenly
at
the
recumbent
figure
there
was
an
unnatural
rigidity
about
its
attitude
he
hastily
unlocked
the
door
and
entering
the
cell
bent
over
the
prostrate
form
there
was
no
sound
of
breathing
he
turned
the
body
over
it
was
cold
and
stiff
the
prisoner
had
torn
the
bandage
from
his
wound
and
bled
to
death
during
the
night
he
had
evidently
been
dead
several
hours
a
matter
of
principle
i
what
our
country
needs
most
in
its
treatment
of
the
race
problem
observed
cicero
clayton
at
one
of
the
monthly
meetings
of
the
blue
vein
society
of
which
he
was
a
prominent
member
is
a
clearer
conception
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
the
same
sentiment
in
much
the
same
words
had
often
fallen
from
clayton
lips
so
often
in
fact
that
the
younger
members
of
the
society
sometimes
spoke
of
him
among
themselves
of
course
as
brotherhood
clayton
the
sobriquet
derived
its
point
from
the
application
he
made
of
the
principle
involved
in
this
proposition
the
fundamental
article
of
clayton
social
creed
was
that
he
himself
was
not
a
negro
i
know
he
would
say
that
the
white
people
lump
us
all
together
as
negroes
and
condemn
us
all
to
the
same
social
ostracism
but
i
accept
this
classification
for
my
part
and
i
imagine
that
as
the
chief
party
in
interest
i
have
a
right
to
my
opinion
people
who
belong
by
half
or
more
of
their
blood
to
the
most
virile
and
progressive
race
of
modern
times
have
as
much
right
to
call
themselves
white
as
others
have
to
call
them
negroes
clayton
spoke
warmly
for
he
was
well
informed
and
had
thought
much
upon
the
subject
too
much
indeed
for
he
had
not
been
able
to
escape
entirely
the
tendency
of
too
much
concentration
upon
one
subject
to
make
even
the
clearest
minds
morbid
of
course
we
ca
enforce
our
claims
or
protect
ourselves
from
being
robbed
of
our
birthright
but
we
can
at
least
have
principles
and
try
to
live
up
to
them
the
best
we
can
if
we
are
not
accepted
as
white
we
can
at
any
rate
make
it
clear
that
we
object
to
being
called
black
our
protest
can
not
fail
in
time
to
impress
itself
upon
the
better
class
of
white
people
for
the
race
loves
justice
and
will
eventually
do
it
where
it
does
not
conflict
with
their
own
interests
whether
or
not
the
fact
that
clayton
meant
no
sarcasm
and
was
conscious
of
no
inconsistency
in
this
eulogy
tended
to
establish
the
racial
identity
he
claimed
may
safely
be
left
to
the
discerning
reader
in
living
up
to
his
creed
clayton
declined
to
associate
to
any
considerable
extent
with
black
people
this
was
sometimes
a
little
inconvenient
and
occasionally
involved
a
sacrifice
of
some
pleasure
for
himself
and
his
family
because
they
would
not
attend
entertainments
where
many
black
people
were
likely
to
be
present
but
they
had
a
social
refuge
in
a
little
society
of
people
like
themselves
they
attended
too
a
church
of
which
nearly
all
the
members
were
white
and
they
were
connected
with
a
number
of
the
religious
and
benevolent
associations
open
to
all
good
citizens
where
they
came
into
contact
with
the
better
class
of
white
people
and
were
treated
in
their
capacity
of
members
with
a
courtesy
and
consideration
scarcely
different
from
that
accorded
to
other
citizens
clayton
racial
theory
was
not
only
logical
enough
but
was
in
his
own
case
backed
up
by
substantial
arguments
he
had
begun
life
with
a
small
patrimony
and
had
invested
his
money
in
a
restaurant
which
by
careful
and
judicious
attention
had
grown
from
a
cheap
into
the
most
popular
and
successful
confectionery
and
catering
establishment
in
groveland
his
business
occupied
a
double
store
on
oakwood
avenue
he
owned
houses
and
lots
and
stocks
and
bonds
had
good
credit
at
the
banks
and
lived
in
a
style
befitting
his
income
and
business
standing
in
person
he
was
of
olive
complexion
with
slightly
curly
hair
his
features
approached
the
cuban
or
type
rather
than
the
familiar
broad
characteristics
of
the
mulatto
this
suggestion
of
something
foreign
being
heightened
by
a
vandyke
beard
and
a
carefully
waxed
and
pointed
mustache
when
he
walked
to
church
on
sunday
mornings
with
his
daughter
alice
they
were
a
couple
of
such
striking
appearance
as
surely
to
attract
attention
miss
alice
clayton
was
queen
of
her
social
set
she
was
young
she
was
handsome
she
was
nearly
white
she
frankly
confessed
her
sorrow
that
she
was
not
entirely
so
she
was
accomplished
and
amiable
dressed
in
good
taste
and
had
for
her
father
by
all
odds
the
richest
colored
man
the
term
is
used
with
apologies
to
clayton
explaining
that
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
a
negro
in
groveland
so
pronounced
was
her
superiority
that
really
she
had
but
one
social
rival
worthy
of
the
name
miss
lura
watkins
whose
father
kept
a
prosperous
livery
stable
and
lived
in
almost
as
good
style
as
the
claytons
miss
watkins
while
enough
was
not
so
young
nor
quite
so
white
as
miss
clayton
she
was
popular
however
among
their
mutual
acquaintances
and
there
was
a
race
between
the
two
as
to
which
should
make
the
first
and
best
marriage
marriages
among
miss
clayton
set
were
serious
affairs
of
course
marriage
is
always
a
serious
matter
whether
it
be
a
success
or
a
failure
and
there
are
those
who
believe
that
any
marriage
is
better
than
no
marriage
but
among
miss
clayton
friends
and
associates
matrimony
took
on
an
added
seriousness
because
of
the
very
narrow
limits
within
which
it
could
take
place
miss
clayton
and
her
friends
by
reason
of
their
assumed
superiority
to
black
people
or
perhaps
as
much
by
reason
of
a
somewhat
morbid
shrinking
from
the
curiosity
manifested
toward
married
people
of
strongly
contrasting
colors
would
not
marry
black
men
and
except
in
rare
instances
white
men
would
not
marry
them
they
were
therefore
restricted
for
a
choice
to
the
young
men
of
their
own
complexion
but
these
unfortunately
for
the
girls
had
a
wider
choice
in
any
state
where
the
laws
permit
freedom
of
the
marriage
contract
a
man
by
virtue
of
his
sex
can
find
a
wife
of
whatever
complexion
he
prefers
of
course
he
must
not
always
ask
too
much
in
other
respects
for
most
women
like
to
better
their
social
position
when
they
marry
to
the
number
thus
lost
by
going
on
the
other
side
as
the
phrase
went
add
the
worthless
contingent
whom
no
woman
would
marry
and
the
choice
was
still
further
restricted
so
that
it
had
become
fashionable
when
the
supply
of
eligible
men
ran
short
for
those
of
miss
clayton
set
who
could
afford
it
to
go
traveling
ostensibly
for
pleasure
but
with
the
serious
hope
that
they
might
meet
their
fate
away
from
home
miss
clayton
had
perhaps
a
larger
option
than
any
of
her
associates
among
such
men
as
there
were
she
could
have
taken
her
choice
her
beauty
her
position
her
accomplishments
her
father
wealth
all
made
her
eminently
desirable
but
on
the
other
hand
the
same
things
rendered
her
more
difficult
to
reach
and
harder
to
please
to
get
access
to
her
heart
too
it
was
necessary
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
her
parents
which
until
she
had
reached
the
age
of
no
one
had
succeeded
in
doing
safely
many
had
called
but
none
had
been
chosen
there
was
however
one
spot
left
unguarded
and
through
it
cupid
a
veteran
sharpshooter
sent
a
dart
clayton
had
taken
into
his
service
and
into
his
household
a
poor
relation
a
sort
of
cousin
several
times
removed
this
boy
his
name
was
jack
had
gone
into
service
at
a
very
youthful
age
twelve
or
thirteen
he
had
helped
about
the
housework
washed
the
dishes
swept
the
floors
taken
care
of
the
lawn
and
the
stable
for
three
or
four
years
while
he
attended
school
his
cousin
had
then
taken
him
into
the
store
where
he
had
swept
the
floor
washed
the
windows
and
done
a
class
of
work
that
kept
fully
impressed
upon
him
the
fact
that
he
was
a
poor
dependent
nevertheless
he
was
a
cheerful
lad
who
took
what
he
could
get
and
was
properly
grateful
but
always
meant
to
get
more
by
sheer
force
of
industry
and
affability
and
shrewdness
he
forced
his
employer
to
promote
him
in
time
to
a
position
of
recognized
authority
in
the
establishment
any
one
outside
of
the
family
would
have
perceived
in
him
a
very
suitable
husband
for
miss
clayton
he
was
of
about
the
same
age
or
a
year
or
two
older
was
as
fair
of
complexion
as
she
when
she
was
not
powdered
and
was
passably
with
a
bearing
of
which
the
natural
manliness
had
been
no
more
warped
than
his
training
and
racial
status
had
rendered
inevitable
for
he
had
early
learned
the
law
of
growth
that
to
bend
is
better
than
to
break
he
was
sometimes
sent
to
accompany
miss
clayton
to
places
in
the
evening
when
she
had
no
other
escort
and
it
is
quite
likely
that
she
discovered
his
good
points
before
her
parents
did
that
they
should
in
time
perceive
them
was
inevitable
but
even
then
so
accustomed
were
they
to
looking
down
upon
the
object
of
their
former
bounty
that
they
only
spoke
of
the
matter
jocularly
well
alice
her
father
would
say
in
his
bluff
way
you
not
be
absolutely
obliged
to
die
an
old
maid
if
we
ca
find
anything
better
for
you
there
always
jack
as
long
as
he
does
take
to
some
other
girl
you
can
fall
back
on
him
as
a
last
chance
he
be
glad
to
take
you
to
get
into
the
business
miss
alice
had
considered
the
joke
a
very
poor
one
when
first
made
but
by
occasional
repetition
she
became
somewhat
familiar
with
it
in
time
it
got
around
to
jack
himself
to
whom
it
seemed
no
joke
at
all
he
had
long
considered
it
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
wished
and
when
he
became
aware
that
the
possibility
of
such
a
match
had
occurred
to
the
other
parties
in
interest
he
made
up
his
mind
that
the
idea
should
in
due
course
of
time
become
an
accomplished
fact
he
had
even
suggested
as
much
to
alice
in
a
casual
way
to
feel
his
ground
and
while
she
had
treated
the
matter
lightly
he
was
not
without
hope
that
she
had
been
impressed
by
the
suggestion
before
he
had
had
time
however
to
follow
up
this
lead
miss
clayton
in
the
spring
of
went
away
on
a
visit
to
washington
the
occasion
of
her
visit
was
a
presidential
inauguration
the
new
president
owed
his
nomination
mainly
to
the
votes
of
the
southern
delegates
in
the
convention
and
was
believed
to
be
correspondingly
well
disposed
to
the
race
from
which
the
southern
delegates
were
for
the
most
part
recruited
friends
of
rival
and
unsuccessful
candidates
for
the
nomination
had
more
than
hinted
that
the
southern
delegates
were
very
substantially
rewarded
for
their
support
at
the
time
when
it
was
given
whether
this
was
true
or
not
the
parties
concerned
know
best
at
any
rate
the
colored
politicians
did
not
see
it
in
that
light
for
they
were
gathered
from
near
and
far
to
press
their
claims
for
recognition
and
patronage
on
the
evening
following
the
white
house
inaugural
ball
the
colored
people
of
washington
gave
an
inaugural
ball
at
a
large
public
hall
it
was
under
the
management
of
their
leading
citizens
among
them
several
high
officials
holding
over
from
the
last
administration
and
a
number
of
professional
and
business
men
this
ball
was
the
most
noteworthy
social
event
that
colored
circles
up
to
that
time
had
ever
known
there
were
many
visitors
from
various
parts
of
the
country
miss
clayton
attended
the
ball
the
honors
of
which
she
carried
away
easily
she
danced
with
several
partners
and
was
introduced
to
innumerable
people
whom
she
had
never
seen
before
and
whom
she
hardly
expected
ever
to
meet
again
she
went
away
from
the
ball
at
four
in
the
morning
in
a
glow
of
triumph
and
with
a
confused
impression
of
senators
and
representatives
and
lawyers
and
doctors
of
all
shades
who
had
sought
an
introduction
led
her
through
the
dance
and
overwhelmed
her
with
compliments
she
returned
home
the
next
day
but
one
after
the
most
delightful
week
of
her
life
ii
one
afternoon
about
three
weeks
after
her
return
from
washington
alice
received
a
letter
through
the
mail
the
envelope
bore
the
words
house
of
representatives
printed
in
one
corner
and
in
the
opposite
corner
in
a
bold
running
hand
a
congressman
frank
hamilton
brown
the
letter
read
as
follows
house
of
representatives
washington
march
miss
alice
clayton
groveland
dear
friend
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
call
you
so
after
so
brief
an
acquaintance
i
remember
with
sincerest
pleasure
our
recent
meeting
at
the
inaugural
ball
and
the
sensation
created
by
your
beauty
your
amiable
manners
and
your
graceful
dancing
time
has
so
strengthened
the
impression
i
then
received
that
i
should
have
felt
inconsolable
had
i
thought
it
impossible
ever
to
again
behold
the
charms
which
had
brightened
the
occasion
of
our
meeting
and
eclipsed
by
their
brilliancy
the
leading
belles
of
the
capital
i
had
hoped
however
to
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
again
and
circumstances
have
fortunately
placed
it
in
my
power
to
do
so
at
an
early
date
you
have
doubtless
learned
that
the
contest
over
the
election
in
the
sixth
congressional
district
of
south
carolina
has
been
decided
in
my
favor
and
that
i
now
have
the
honor
of
representing
my
native
state
at
the
national
capital
i
have
just
been
appointed
a
member
of
a
special
committee
to
visit
and
inspect
the
sault
river
and
the
straits
of
mackinac
with
reference
to
the
needs
of
lake
navigation
i
have
made
arrangements
to
start
a
week
ahead
of
the
other
members
of
the
committee
whom
i
am
to
meet
in
detroit
on
the
i
shall
leave
here
on
the
and
will
arrive
in
groveland
on
the
by
the
evening
express
i
shall
remain
in
groveland
several
days
in
the
course
of
which
i
shall
be
pleased
to
call
and
renew
the
acquaintance
so
auspiciously
begun
in
washington
which
it
is
my
fondest
hope
may
ripen
into
a
warmer
friendship
if
you
do
not
regard
my
visit
as
presumptuous
and
do
not
write
me
in
the
mean
while
forbidding
it
i
shall
do
myself
the
pleasure
of
waiting
on
you
the
morning
after
my
arrival
in
groveland
with
renewed
expressions
of
my
sincere
admiration
and
profound
esteem
i
remain
sincerely
yours
hamilton
brown
to
alice
and
especially
to
her
mother
this
bold
and
flowery
letter
had
very
nearly
the
force
of
a
formal
declaration
they
read
it
over
again
and
again
and
spent
most
of
the
afternoon
discussing
it
there
were
few
young
men
in
groveland
eligible
as
husbands
for
so
superior
a
person
as
alice
clayton
and
an
addition
to
the
number
would
be
very
acceptable
but
the
mere
fact
of
his
being
a
congressman
was
not
sufficient
to
qualify
him
there
were
other
considerations
i
never
heard
of
this
honorable
hamilton
brown
said
clayton
the
letter
had
been
laid
before
him
at
the
it
strange
alice
that
you
have
said
anything
about
him
before
you
must
have
met
lots
of
swell
folks
not
to
recollect
a
congressman
but
he
was
a
congressman
then
answered
alice
he
was
only
a
claimant
i
remember
senator
bruce
and
douglass
but
there
were
so
many
doctors
and
lawyers
and
politicians
that
i
could
keep
track
of
them
all
still
i
have
a
faint
impression
of
a
brown
who
danced
with
me
she
went
into
the
parlor
and
brought
out
the
dancing
programme
she
had
used
at
the
washington
ball
she
had
decorated
it
with
a
bow
of
blue
ribbon
and
preserved
it
as
a
souvenir
of
her
visit
yes
she
said
after
examining
it
i
must
have
danced
with
him
here
are
the
initials
what
color
is
he
asked
clayton
as
he
plied
his
knife
and
fork
i
have
a
notion
that
he
was
rather
dark
darker
than
any
one
i
had
ever
danced
with
before
why
did
you
dance
with
him
asked
her
father
you
were
obliged
to
go
back
on
your
principles
because
you
were
away
from
home
well
father
you
in
rome
you
know
the
rest
clearweather
introduced
me
to
several
dark
men
to
him
among
others
they
were
her
friends
and
common
decency
required
me
to
be
courteous
if
this
man
is
black
we
do
want
to
encourage
him
if
he
the
right
sort
we
invite
him
to
the
house
and
make
him
feel
at
home
added
clayton
on
hospitable
thoughts
intent
we
must
ask
sadler
about
him
said
clayton
when
he
had
drunk
his
coffee
and
lighted
his
cigar
if
he
the
right
man
he
shall
have
cause
to
remember
his
visit
to
groveland
we
show
him
that
washington
is
not
the
only
town
on
earth
the
uncertainty
of
the
family
with
regard
to
brown
was
soon
removed
solomon
sadler
who
was
supposed
to
know
everything
worth
knowing
concerning
the
colored
race
and
everybody
of
importance
connected
with
it
dropped
in
after
supper
to
make
an
evening
call
sadler
was
familiar
with
the
history
of
every
man
of
negro
ancestry
who
had
distinguished
himself
in
any
walk
of
life
he
could
give
the
pedigree
of
alexander
pushkin
the
titles
of
scores
of
dumas
novels
even
sadler
had
not
time
to
learn
them
all
and
could
recite
the
whole
of
wendell
phillips
lecture
on
toussaint
he
claimed
a
personal
acquaintance
with
frederick
douglass
and
had
been
often
in
washington
where
he
was
well
known
and
well
received
in
good
colored
society
let
me
see
he
said
reflectively
when
asked
for
information
about
the
honorable
hamilton
brown
yes
i
think
i
know
him
he
studied
at
oberlin
just
after
the
war
he
was
about
leaving
there
when
i
entered
there
were
two
browns
there
a
hamilton
brown
and
a
henry
brown
one
was
stout
and
dark
and
the
other
was
slim
and
quite
light
you
could
scarcely
tell
him
from
a
dark
white
man
they
used
to
call
them
brown
and
brown
i
did
know
either
of
them
except
by
sight
for
they
were
there
only
a
few
weeks
after
i
went
in
as
i
remember
them
hamilton
was
the
fair
one
a
very
gentlemanly
fellow
and
as
i
heard
a
good
student
and
a
fine
speaker
do
you
remember
what
kind
of
hair
he
had
asked
clayton
very
good
indeed
straight
as
i
remember
it
he
looked
something
like
a
spaniard
or
a
portuguese
now
that
you
describe
him
said
alice
i
remember
quite
well
dancing
with
such
a
gentleman
and
i
wrong
about
my
the
dark
man
must
have
been
some
one
else
there
are
two
others
on
my
card
that
i
ca
remember
distinctly
and
he
was
probably
one
of
those
i
guess
he
all
right
alice
said
her
father
when
sadler
had
gone
away
he
evidently
means
business
and
we
must
treat
him
white
of
course
he
must
stay
with
us
there
are
no
hotels
in
groveland
while
he
is
here
let
see
he
be
here
in
three
days
that
is
very
long
but
i
guess
we
can
get
ready
i
write
a
letter
this
afternoon
or
you
write
it
and
invite
him
to
the
house
and
say
i
meet
him
at
the
depot
and
you
may
have
for
making
the
preparations
we
must
have
some
people
to
meet
him
certainly
a
reception
is
the
proper
thing
sit
down
immediately
and
write
the
letter
and
i
mail
it
first
thing
in
the
morning
so
he
get
it
before
he
has
time
to
make
other
arrangements
and
you
and
your
mother
put
your
heads
together
and
make
out
a
list
of
guests
and
i
have
the
invitations
printed
we
will
show
the
darkeys
of
groveland
how
to
entertain
a
congressman
it
will
be
noted
that
in
moments
of
abstraction
or
excitement
clayton
sometimes
relapsed
into
forms
of
speech
not
entirely
consistent
with
his
principles
but
some
allowance
must
be
made
for
his
atmosphere
he
could
no
more
escape
from
it
than
the
leopard
can
change
his
spots
or
the
in
deference
to
clayton
feelings
the
quotation
will
be
left
incomplete
alice
wrote
the
letter
on
the
spot
and
it
was
duly
mailed
and
sped
on
its
winged
way
to
washington
the
preparations
for
the
reception
were
made
as
thoroughly
and
elaborately
as
possible
on
so
short
a
notice
the
invitations
were
issued
the
house
was
cleaned
from
attic
to
cellar
an
orchestra
was
engaged
for
the
evening
elaborate
floral
decorations
were
planned
and
the
flowers
ordered
even
the
refreshments
which
ordinarily
in
the
household
of
a
caterer
would
be
mere
matter
of
familiar
detail
became
a
subject
of
serious
consultation
and
study
the
approaching
event
was
a
matter
of
very
much
interest
to
the
fortunate
ones
who
were
honored
with
invitations
and
this
for
several
reasons
they
were
anxious
to
meet
this
sole
representative
of
their
race
in
the
th
congress
and
as
he
was
not
one
of
the
colored
leaders
but
a
new
star
risen
on
the
political
horizon
there
was
a
special
curiosity
to
see
who
he
was
and
what
he
looked
like
moreover
the
claytons
did
not
often
entertain
a
large
company
but
when
they
did
it
was
on
a
scale
commensurate
with
their
means
and
position
and
to
be
present
on
such
an
occasion
was
a
thing
to
remember
and
to
talk
about
and
most
important
consideration
of
all
some
remarks
dropped
by
members
of
the
clayton
family
had
given
rise
to
the
rumor
that
the
congressman
was
seeking
a
wife
this
invested
his
visit
with
a
romantic
interest
and
gave
the
reception
a
practical
value
for
there
were
other
marriageable
girls
besides
miss
clayton
and
if
one
was
left
another
might
be
taken
iii
on
the
evening
of
april
at
fifteen
minutes
of
six
clayton
accompanied
by
jack
entered
the
livery
carriage
waiting
at
his
gate
and
ordered
the
coachman
to
drive
to
the
union
depot
he
had
taken
jack
along
partly
for
company
and
partly
that
jack
might
relieve
the
congressman
of
any
trouble
about
his
baggage
and
make
himself
useful
in
case
of
emergency
jack
was
willing
enough
to
go
for
he
had
foreseen
in
the
visitor
a
rival
for
alice
hand
indeed
he
had
heard
more
or
less
of
the
subject
for
several
days
and
was
glad
to
make
a
reconnaissance
before
the
enemy
arrived
upon
the
field
of
battle
he
had
made
at
least
he
had
thought
so
considerable
progress
with
alice
during
the
three
weeks
since
her
return
from
washington
and
once
or
twice
alice
had
been
perilously
near
the
tender
stage
this
visit
had
disturbed
the
situation
and
threatened
to
ruin
his
chances
but
he
did
not
mean
to
give
up
without
a
struggle
arrived
at
the
main
entrance
clayton
directed
the
carriage
to
wait
and
entered
the
station
with
jack
the
union
depot
at
groveland
was
an
immense
oblong
structure
covering
a
dozen
parallel
tracks
and
furnishing
terminal
passenger
facilities
for
half
a
dozen
railroads
the
tracks
ran
east
and
west
and
the
depot
was
entered
from
the
south
at
about
the
middle
of
the
building
on
either
side
of
the
entrance
the
refreshment
rooms
baggage
and
express
departments
and
other
administrative
offices
extended
in
a
row
for
the
entire
length
of
the
building
and
beyond
them
and
parallel
with
them
stretched
a
long
open
space
separated
from
the
tracks
by
an
iron
fence
or
there
were
two
entrance
gates
in
the
fence
at
which
tickets
must
be
shown
before
access
could
be
had
to
trains
and
two
other
gates
by
which
arriving
passengers
came
out
clayton
looked
at
the
blackboard
on
the
wall
underneath
the
station
clock
and
observed
that
the
train
from
washington
was
five
minutes
late
accompanied
by
jack
he
walked
up
and
down
the
platform
until
the
train
with
the
usual
accompaniment
of
panting
steam
and
clanging
bell
and
rumbling
trucks
pulled
into
the
station
and
drew
up
on
the
third
or
fourth
track
from
the
iron
railing
clayton
stationed
himself
at
the
gate
nearest
the
rear
end
of
the
train
reasoning
that
the
congressman
would
ride
in
a
parlor
car
and
would
naturally
come
out
by
the
gate
nearest
the
point
at
which
he
left
the
train
you
better
go
and
stand
by
the
other
gate
jack
he
said
to
his
companion
and
stop
him
if
he
goes
out
that
way
the
train
was
well
filled
and
a
stream
of
passengers
poured
through
clayton
scanned
the
crowd
carefully
as
they
approached
the
gate
and
scrutinized
each
passenger
as
he
came
through
without
seeing
any
one
that
met
the
description
of
congressman
brown
as
given
by
sadler
or
any
one
that
could
in
his
opinion
be
the
gentleman
for
whom
he
was
looking
when
the
last
one
had
passed
through
he
was
left
to
the
conclusion
that
his
expected
guest
had
gone
out
by
the
other
gate
clayton
hastened
thither
did
he
come
out
this
way
jack
he
asked
no
sir
replied
the
young
man
i
have
seen
him
that
strange
mused
clayton
somewhat
anxiously
he
would
hardly
fail
to
come
without
giving
us
notice
surely
we
must
have
missed
him
we
better
look
around
a
little
you
go
that
way
and
i
go
this
clayton
turned
and
walked
several
rods
along
the
platform
to
the
men
and
standing
near
the
door
glanced
around
to
see
if
he
could
find
the
object
of
his
search
the
only
colored
person
in
the
room
was
a
stout
and
very
black
man
wearing
a
broadcloth
suit
and
a
silk
hat
and
seated
a
short
distance
from
the
door
on
the
seat
by
his
side
stood
a
couple
of
valises
on
one
of
them
the
one
nearest
him
on
which
his
arm
rested
was
written
in
white
letters
plainly
legible
brown
washington
clayton
feelings
at
this
discovery
can
better
be
imagined
than
described
he
hastily
left
the
before
the
black
gentleman
who
was
looking
the
other
way
was
even
aware
of
his
presence
and
walking
rapidly
up
and
down
the
platform
communed
with
himself
upon
what
course
of
action
the
situation
demanded
he
had
invited
to
his
house
had
come
down
to
meet
had
made
elaborate
preparations
to
entertain
on
the
following
evening
a
man
a
white
man
by
his
theory
an
acceptable
guest
a
possible
husband
for
his
daughter
an
avowed
suitor
for
her
hand
if
the
congressman
had
turned
out
to
be
brown
even
dark
brown
with
fairly
good
hair
though
he
might
not
have
desired
him
as
a
yet
he
could
have
welcomed
him
as
a
guest
but
even
this
softening
of
the
blow
was
denied
him
for
the
man
in
the
was
palpably
aggressively
black
with
pronounced
african
features
and
woolly
hair
without
apparently
a
single
drop
of
redeeming
white
blood
could
he
in
the
face
of
his
principles
his
lifelong
rule
of
conduct
take
this
negro
into
his
home
and
introduce
him
to
his
friends
could
he
subject
his
wife
and
daughter
to
the
rude
shock
of
such
a
disappointment
it
would
be
bad
enough
for
them
to
learn
of
the
ghastly
mistake
but
to
have
him
in
the
house
would
be
twisting
the
arrow
in
the
wound
clayton
had
the
instincts
of
a
gentleman
and
realized
the
delicacy
of
the
situation
but
to
get
out
of
his
difficulty
without
wounding
the
feelings
of
the
congressman
required
not
only
diplomacy
but
dispatch
whatever
he
did
must
be
done
promptly
for
if
he
waited
many
minutes
the
congressman
would
probably
take
a
carriage
and
be
driven
to
clayton
residence
a
ray
of
hope
came
for
a
moment
to
illumine
the
gloom
of
the
situation
perhaps
the
black
man
was
merely
sitting
there
and
not
the
owner
of
the
valise
for
there
were
two
valises
one
on
each
side
of
the
supposed
congressman
for
obvious
reasons
he
did
not
care
to
make
the
inquiry
himself
so
he
looked
around
for
his
companion
who
came
up
a
moment
later
jack
he
exclaimed
excitedly
i
afraid
we
in
the
worst
kind
of
a
hole
unless
there
some
mistake
run
down
to
the
men
and
you
see
a
man
and
a
valise
and
you
understand
what
i
mean
ask
that
darkey
if
he
is
the
honorable
brown
congressman
from
south
carolina
if
he
says
yes
come
back
right
away
and
let
me
know
without
giving
him
time
to
ask
any
questions
and
put
your
wits
to
work
to
help
me
out
of
the
scrape
i
wonder
what
the
matter
said
jack
to
himself
but
did
as
he
was
told
in
a
moment
he
came
running
back
yes
sir
he
announced
he
says
he
the
man
jack
said
clayton
desperately
if
you
want
to
show
your
appreciation
of
what
i
done
for
you
you
must
suggest
some
way
out
of
this
i
never
dare
to
take
that
negro
to
my
house
and
yet
i
obliged
to
treat
him
like
a
gentleman
jack
eyes
had
worn
a
somewhat
reflective
look
since
he
had
gone
to
make
the
inquiry
suddenly
his
face
brightened
with
intelligence
and
then
as
a
newsboy
ran
into
the
station
calling
his
wares
hardened
into
determination
clarion
special
extry
all
about
de
epidemic
er
clamored
the
newsboy
with
shrill
childish
treble
as
he
made
his
way
toward
the
jack
darted
after
him
and
saw
the
man
to
whom
he
had
spoken
buy
a
paper
he
ran
back
to
his
employer
and
dragged
him
over
toward
the
window
i
have
it
sir
he
exclaimed
seizing
a
telegraph
blank
and
writing
rapidly
and
reading
aloud
as
he
wrote
how
this
for
a
way
out
dear
sir
i
write
you
this
note
here
in
the
depot
to
inform
you
of
an
unfortunate
event
which
has
interfered
with
my
plans
and
those
of
my
family
for
your
entertainment
while
in
groveland
yesterday
my
daughter
alice
complained
of
a
sore
throat
which
by
this
afternoon
had
developed
into
a
case
of
malignant
diphtheria
in
consequence
our
house
has
been
quarantined
and
while
i
have
felt
myself
obliged
to
come
down
to
the
depot
i
do
not
feel
that
i
ought
to
expose
you
to
the
possibility
of
infection
and
i
therefore
send
you
this
by
another
hand
the
bearer
will
conduct
you
to
a
carriage
which
i
have
ordered
placed
at
your
service
and
unless
you
should
prefer
some
other
hotel
you
will
be
driven
to
the
forest
hill
house
where
i
beg
you
will
consider
yourself
my
guest
during
your
stay
in
the
city
and
make
the
fullest
use
of
every
convenience
it
may
offer
from
present
indications
i
fear
no
one
of
our
family
will
be
able
to
see
you
which
we
shall
regret
beyond
expression
as
we
have
made
elaborate
arrangements
for
your
entertainment
i
still
hope
however
that
you
may
enjoy
your
visit
as
there
are
many
places
of
interest
in
the
city
and
many
friends
will
doubtless
be
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
with
assurances
of
my
profound
regret
i
am
sincerely
yours
cicero
clayton
splendid
cried
clayton
you
helped
me
out
of
a
horrible
scrape
now
go
and
take
him
to
the
hotel
and
see
him
comfortably
located
and
tell
them
to
charge
the
bill
to
me
i
suspect
sir
suggested
jack
that
i
better
not
go
up
to
the
house
and
you
have
to
stay
in
yourself
for
a
day
or
two
to
keep
up
appearances
i
sleep
on
the
lounge
at
the
store
and
we
can
talk
business
over
the
telephone
all
right
jack
we
arrange
the
details
later
but
for
sake
get
him
started
or
he
be
calling
a
hack
to
drive
up
to
the
house
i
go
home
on
a
street
car
so
far
so
good
sighed
clayton
to
himself
as
he
escaped
from
the
station
jack
is
a
deuced
clever
fellow
and
i
have
to
do
something
more
for
him
but
the
is
yet
to
come
i
got
to
bribe
a
doctor
shut
up
the
house
for
a
day
or
two
and
have
all
the
of
two
disappointed
women
to
endure
until
this
negro
leaves
town
well
i
sure
my
wife
and
alice
will
back
me
up
at
any
cost
no
sacrifice
is
too
great
to
escape
having
to
entertain
him
of
course
i
have
no
prejudice
against
his
color
he
ca
help
that
but
it
is
the
of
the
thing
if
we
received
him
it
would
be
a
concession
fatal
to
all
my
views
and
theories
and
i
am
really
doing
him
a
kindness
for
i
sure
that
all
the
world
could
not
make
alice
and
her
mother
treat
him
with
anything
but
cold
politeness
it
be
a
great
mortification
to
alice
but
i
do
see
how
else
i
could
have
got
out
of
it
he
boarded
the
first
car
that
left
the
depot
and
soon
reached
home
the
house
was
lighted
up
and
through
the
lace
curtains
of
the
parlor
windows
he
could
see
his
wife
and
daughter
elegantly
dressed
waiting
to
receive
their
distinguished
visitor
he
rang
the
bell
impatiently
and
a
servant
opened
the
door
the
gentleman
did
come
asked
the
maid
no
he
said
as
he
hung
up
his
hat
this
brought
the
ladies
to
the
door
he
did
come
they
exclaimed
what
the
matter
i
tell
you
he
said
mary
this
to
the
servant
a
white
girl
who
stood
in
curiosity
we
sha
need
you
any
more
then
he
went
into
the
parlor
and
closing
the
door
told
his
story
when
he
reached
the
point
where
he
had
discovered
the
color
of
the
honorable
brown
miss
clayton
caught
her
breath
and
was
on
the
verge
of
collapse
that
nigger
said
clayton
indignantly
can
never
set
foot
in
this
house
but
what
did
you
do
with
him
clayton
quickly
unfolded
his
plan
and
described
the
disposition
he
had
made
of
the
congressman
it
an
awful
shame
said
clayton
just
think
of
the
trouble
and
expense
we
have
gone
to
and
poor
alice
never
get
over
it
for
everybody
knows
he
came
to
see
her
and
that
he
smitten
with
her
but
you
done
just
right
we
never
would
have
been
able
to
hold
up
our
heads
again
if
we
had
introduced
a
black
man
even
a
congressman
to
the
people
that
are
invited
here
night
as
a
sweetheart
of
alice
why
she
would
marry
him
if
he
was
president
of
the
united
states
and
plated
with
gold
an
inch
thick
the
very
idea
well
said
clayton
then
we
got
to
act
quick
alice
must
wrap
up
her
throat
by
the
way
alice
how
your
throat
it
sore
sobbed
alice
who
had
been
in
tears
almost
from
her
father
return
and
i
do
care
if
i
do
have
diphtheria
and
die
no
i
do
and
she
wept
on
wrap
up
your
throat
and
go
to
bed
and
i
go
over
to
doctor
pillsbury
and
get
a
diphtheria
card
to
nail
up
on
the
house
in
the
morning
first
thing
we
have
to
write
notes
recalling
the
invitations
for
evening
and
have
them
delivered
by
messenger
boys
we
were
fools
for
not
finding
out
all
about
this
man
from
some
one
who
knew
before
we
invited
him
here
sadler
do
know
more
than
half
he
thinks
he
does
anyway
and
we
have
to
do
this
thing
thoroughly
or
our
motives
will
be
misconstrued
and
people
will
say
we
are
prejudiced
and
all
that
when
it
is
only
a
matter
of
principle
with
us
the
programme
outlined
above
was
carried
out
to
the
letter
the
invitations
were
recalled
to
the
great
disappointment
of
the
invited
guests
the
family
physician
called
several
times
during
the
day
alice
remained
in
bed
and
the
maid
left
without
notice
in
such
a
hurry
that
she
forgot
to
take
her
best
clothes
clayton
himself
remained
at
home
he
had
a
telephone
in
the
house
and
was
therefore
in
easy
communication
with
his
office
so
that
the
business
did
not
suffer
materially
by
reason
of
his
absence
from
the
store
about
ten
in
the
morning
a
note
came
up
from
the
hotel
expressing
brown
regrets
and
sympathy
toward
noon
clayton
picked
up
the
morning
paper
which
he
had
not
theretofore
had
time
to
read
and
was
glancing
over
it
casually
when
his
eye
fell
upon
a
column
headed
a
colored
congressman
he
read
the
article
with
astonishment
that
rapidly
turned
to
chagrin
and
dismay
it
was
an
interview
describing
the
congressman
as
a
tall
and
shapely
man
about
years
old
with
an
olive
complexion
not
noticeably
darker
than
many
a
white
man
straight
hair
and
eyes
as
black
as
sloes
the
bearing
of
this
son
of
south
carolina
reveals
the
polished
manners
of
the
southern
gentleman
and
neither
from
his
appearance
nor
his
conversation
would
one
suspect
that
the
white
blood
which
flows
in
his
veins
in
such
preponderating
measure
had
ever
been
crossed
by
that
of
a
darker
race
wrote
the
reporter
who
had
received
instructions
at
the
office
that
for
urgent
business
considerations
the
lake
shipping
interest
wanted
representative
brown
treated
with
marked
consideration
there
was
more
of
the
article
but
the
introductory
portion
left
clayton
in
such
a
state
of
bewilderment
that
the
paper
fell
from
his
hand
what
was
the
meaning
of
it
had
he
been
mistaken
obviously
so
or
else
the
reporter
was
wrong
which
was
manifestly
improbable
when
he
had
recovered
himself
somewhat
he
picked
up
the
newspaper
and
began
reading
where
he
had
left
off
representative
brown
traveled
to
groveland
in
company
with
bishop
jones
of
the
african
methodist
jerusalem
church
who
is
to
attend
the
general
conference
of
his
denomination
at
detroit
next
week
the
bishop
who
came
in
while
the
writer
was
interviewing
brown
is
a
splendid
type
of
the
pure
negro
he
is
said
to
be
a
man
of
great
power
among
his
people
which
may
easily
be
believed
after
one
has
looked
upon
his
expressive
countenance
and
heard
him
discuss
the
questions
which
affect
the
welfare
of
his
church
and
his
race
clayton
stared
at
the
paper
bishop
he
repeated
a
splendid
type
of
the
pure
negro
i
must
have
mistaken
the
bishop
for
the
congressman
but
how
in
the
world
did
jack
get
the
thing
balled
up
i
call
up
the
store
and
demand
an
explanation
of
him
jack
he
asked
what
kind
of
a
looking
man
was
the
fellow
you
gave
the
note
to
at
the
depot
he
was
a
very
fellow
sir
came
back
the
answer
he
had
a
bad
eye
looked
like
a
gambler
sir
i
am
not
surprised
that
you
did
want
to
entertain
him
even
if
he
was
a
congressman
what
color
was
he
that
what
i
want
to
know
and
what
kind
of
hair
did
he
have
why
he
was
about
my
complexion
sir
and
had
straight
black
hair
the
rules
of
the
telephone
company
did
not
permit
swearing
over
the
line
clayton
broke
the
rules
was
there
any
one
else
with
him
he
asked
when
he
had
relieved
his
mind
yes
sir
bishop
jones
of
the
african
methodist
jerusalem
church
was
sitting
there
with
him
they
had
traveled
from
washington
together
i
drove
the
bishop
to
his
after
i
had
left
brown
at
the
hotel
i
did
suppose
you
mind
clayton
fell
into
a
chair
and
indulged
in
thoughts
unutterable
he
folded
up
the
paper
and
slipped
it
under
the
family
bible
where
it
was
least
likely
to
be
soon
discovered
i
hide
the
paper
anyway
he
groaned
i
never
hear
the
last
of
this
till
my
dying
day
so
i
may
as
well
have
a
few
hours
respite
it
too
late
to
go
back
and
we
got
to
play
the
farce
out
alice
is
really
sick
with
disappointment
and
to
let
her
know
this
now
would
only
make
her
worse
maybe
he
leave
town
in
a
day
or
two
and
then
she
be
in
condition
to
stand
it
such
luck
is
enough
to
disgust
a
man
with
trying
to
do
right
and
live
up
to
his
principles
time
hung
a
little
heavy
on
clayton
hands
during
the
day
his
wife
was
busy
with
the
housework
he
answered
several
telephone
calls
about
alice
health
and
called
up
the
store
occasionally
to
ask
how
the
business
was
getting
on
after
lunch
he
lay
down
on
a
sofa
and
took
a
nap
from
which
he
was
aroused
by
the
sound
of
the
he
went
to
the
door
the
evening
paper
was
lying
on
the
porch
and
the
newsboy
who
had
not
observed
the
diphtheria
sign
until
after
he
had
rung
was
hurrying
away
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
clayton
opened
the
paper
and
looked
it
through
to
see
if
there
was
any
reference
to
the
visiting
congressman
he
found
what
he
sought
and
more
an
article
on
the
local
page
contained
a
resume
of
the
information
given
in
the
morning
paper
with
the
following
additional
paragraph
a
reporter
who
called
at
the
forest
hill
this
morning
to
interview
representative
brown
was
informed
that
the
congressman
had
been
invited
to
spend
the
remainder
of
his
time
in
groveland
as
the
guest
of
william
watkins
the
proprietor
of
the
popular
livery
establishment
on
main
street
brown
will
remain
in
the
city
several
days
and
a
reception
will
be
tendered
him
at
watkins
on
wednesday
evening
that
ends
it
sighed
clayton
the
dove
of
peace
will
never
again
rest
on
my
but
why
dwell
longer
on
the
sufferings
of
clayton
or
attempt
to
describe
the
feelings
or
chronicle
the
remarks
of
his
wife
and
daughter
when
they
learned
the
facts
in
the
case
as
to
representative
brown
he
was
made
welcome
in
the
hospitable
home
of
william
watkins
there
was
a
large
and
brilliant
assemblage
at
the
party
on
wednesday
evening
at
which
were
displayed
the
costumes
prepared
for
the
clayton
reception
brown
took
a
fancy
to
miss
lura
watkins
to
whom
before
the
week
was
over
he
became
engaged
to
be
married
meantime
poor
alice
the
innocent
victim
of
circumstances
and
principles
lay
sick
abed
with
a
supposititious
case
of
malignant
diphtheria
and
a
real
case
of
acute
disappointment
and
chagrin
oh
jack
exclaimed
alice
a
few
weeks
later
on
the
way
home
from
evening
church
in
company
with
the
young
man
what
a
dreadful
thing
it
all
was
and
to
think
of
that
hateful
lura
watkins
marrying
the
congressman
the
street
was
shaded
by
trees
at
the
point
where
they
were
passing
and
there
was
no
one
in
sight
jack
put
his
arm
around
her
waist
and
leaning
over
kissed
her
never
mind
dear
he
said
soothingly
you
still
have
your
chance
left
and
i
prove
myself
a
better
man
than
the
congressman
occasionally
at
social
meetings
when
the
vexed
question
of
the
future
of
the
colored
race
comes
up
as
it
often
does
for
discussion
clayton
may
still
be
heard
to
remark
sententiously
what
the
white
people
of
the
united
states
need
most
in
dealing
with
this
problem
is
a
higher
conception
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
for
of
one
blood
god
made
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
cicely
dream
i
the
old
woman
stood
at
the
back
door
of
the
cabin
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
and
looking
across
the
vegetable
garden
that
ran
up
to
the
very
door
beyond
the
garden
she
saw
bathed
in
the
sunlight
a
field
of
corn
just
in
the
ear
stretching
for
half
a
mile
its
yellow
tassels
overtopping
the
dark
green
mass
of
broad
glistening
blades
and
in
the
distance
through
the
faint
morning
haze
of
evaporating
dew
the
line
of
the
woods
of
a
still
darker
green
meeting
the
clear
blue
of
the
summer
sky
old
dinah
saw
going
down
the
path
a
tall
brown
girl
in
a
homespun
frock
swinging
a
in
one
hand
and
a
splint
basket
in
the
other
oh
cicely
she
called
the
girl
turned
and
answered
in
a
resonant
voice
vibrating
with
youth
and
life
yes
granny
be
sho
and
pick
a
good
mess
er
peas
chile
fer
yo
gwine
ter
be
home
ter
dinner
the
old
woman
stood
a
moment
longer
and
then
turned
to
go
into
the
house
what
she
had
not
seen
was
that
the
girl
was
not
only
young
but
lithe
and
shapely
as
a
sculptor
model
that
her
bare
feet
seemed
to
spurn
the
earth
as
they
struck
it
that
though
brown
she
was
not
so
brown
but
that
her
cheek
was
darkly
red
with
the
blood
of
another
race
than
that
which
gave
her
her
name
and
station
in
life
and
the
old
woman
did
not
see
that
cicely
face
was
as
comely
as
her
figure
was
superb
and
that
her
eyes
were
dreamy
with
vague
yearnings
cicely
climbed
the
low
fence
between
the
garden
and
the
cornfield
and
started
down
one
of
the
long
rows
leading
directly
away
from
the
house
old
needham
was
a
good
ploughman
and
straight
as
an
arrow
ran
the
furrow
between
the
rows
of
corn
until
it
vanished
in
the
distant
perspective
the
peas
were
planted
beside
alternate
hills
of
corn
the
cornstalks
serving
as
supports
for
the
climbing
the
vines
nearest
the
house
had
been
picked
more
or
less
clear
of
the
long
green
pods
and
cicely
walked
down
the
row
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
where
the
peas
were
more
plentiful
and
as
she
walked
she
thought
of
her
dream
of
the
night
before
she
had
dreamed
a
beautiful
dream
the
fact
that
it
was
a
beautiful
dream
a
delightful
dream
her
memory
retained
very
vividly
she
was
troubled
because
she
could
not
remember
just
what
her
dream
had
been
about
of
one
other
fact
she
was
certain
that
in
her
dream
she
had
found
something
and
that
her
happiness
had
been
bound
up
with
the
thing
she
had
found
as
she
walked
down
the
she
ran
over
in
her
mind
the
various
things
with
which
she
had
always
associated
happiness
had
she
found
a
gold
ring
no
it
was
not
a
gold
ring
of
that
she
felt
sure
was
it
a
soft
curly
plume
for
her
hat
she
had
seen
town
people
with
them
and
had
indulged
in
on
the
subject
but
it
was
not
a
feather
was
it
a
silk
dress
no
as
much
as
she
had
always
wanted
one
it
was
not
a
silk
dress
for
an
instant
in
a
dream
she
had
tasted
some
great
and
novel
happiness
and
when
she
awoke
it
was
dashed
from
her
lips
and
she
could
not
even
enjoy
the
memory
of
it
except
in
a
vague
indefinite
and
tantalizing
way
cicely
was
troubled
too
because
dreams
were
serious
things
dreams
had
certain
meanings
most
of
them
and
some
dreams
went
by
contraries
if
her
dream
had
been
a
prophecy
of
some
good
thing
she
had
by
forgetting
it
lost
the
pleasure
of
anticipation
if
her
dream
had
been
one
of
those
that
go
by
contraries
the
warning
would
be
in
vain
because
she
would
not
know
against
what
evil
to
provide
so
with
a
sigh
cicely
said
to
herself
that
it
was
a
troubled
world
more
or
less
and
having
come
to
a
promising
point
began
to
pick
the
tenderest
and
throw
them
into
her
basket
by
the
time
she
had
reached
the
end
of
the
line
the
basket
was
nearly
full
glancing
toward
the
pine
woods
beyond
the
rail
fence
she
saw
a
brier
bush
loaded
with
large
luscious
blackberries
cicely
was
fond
of
blackberries
so
she
set
her
basket
down
climbed
the
fence
and
was
soon
busily
engaged
in
gathering
the
fruit
delicious
even
in
its
wild
state
she
had
soon
eaten
all
she
cared
for
but
the
berries
were
still
numerous
and
it
occurred
to
her
that
her
granddaddy
would
like
a
blackberry
pudding
for
dinner
catching
up
her
apron
and
using
it
as
a
receptacle
for
the
berries
she
had
gathered
scarcely
more
than
a
handful
when
she
heard
a
groan
cicely
was
not
timid
and
her
curiosity
being
aroused
by
the
sound
she
stood
erect
and
remained
in
a
listening
attitude
in
a
moment
the
sound
was
repeated
and
gauging
the
point
from
which
it
came
she
plunged
resolutely
into
the
thick
underbrush
of
the
forest
she
had
gone
but
a
few
yards
when
she
stopped
short
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
concern
upon
the
ground
under
the
shadow
of
the
towering
pines
a
man
lay
at
full
length
a
young
man
several
years
under
thirty
apparently
so
far
as
his
age
could
be
guessed
from
a
face
that
wore
a
short
soft
beard
and
was
so
begrimed
with
dust
and
incrusted
with
blood
that
little
could
be
seen
of
the
underlying
integument
what
was
visible
showed
a
skin
browned
by
nature
or
by
exposure
his
hands
were
of
even
a
darker
brown
almost
as
dark
as
cicely
own
a
tangled
mass
of
very
curly
black
hair
matted
with
burs
dank
with
dew
and
clotted
with
blood
fell
partly
over
his
forehead
on
the
edge
of
which
extending
back
into
the
hair
an
ugly
scalp
wound
was
gaping
and
though
apparently
not
just
inflicted
was
still
bleeding
slowly
as
though
reluctant
to
stop
in
spite
of
the
coagulation
that
had
almost
closed
it
cicely
with
a
glance
took
in
all
this
and
more
but
first
of
all
she
saw
the
man
was
wounded
and
bleeding
and
the
nurse
latent
in
all
womankind
awoke
in
her
to
the
requirements
of
the
situation
she
knew
there
was
a
spring
a
few
rods
away
and
ran
swiftly
to
it
there
was
usually
a
gourd
at
the
spring
but
now
it
was
gone
pouring
out
the
blackberries
in
a
little
heap
where
they
could
be
found
again
she
took
off
her
apron
dipped
one
end
of
it
into
the
spring
and
ran
back
to
the
wounded
man
the
apron
was
clean
and
she
squeezed
a
little
stream
of
water
from
it
into
the
man
mouth
he
swallowed
it
with
avidity
cicely
then
knelt
by
his
side
and
with
the
wet
end
of
her
apron
washed
the
blood
from
the
wound
lightly
and
the
dust
from
the
man
face
then
she
looked
at
her
apron
a
moment
debating
whether
she
should
tear
it
or
not
i
feared
granny
be
mad
she
said
to
herself
i
reckon
i
jes
use
de
whole
apron
so
she
bound
the
apron
around
his
head
as
well
as
she
could
and
then
sat
down
a
moment
on
a
fallen
tree
trunk
to
think
what
she
should
do
next
the
man
already
seemed
more
comfortable
he
had
ceased
moaning
and
lay
quiet
though
breathing
heavily
what
shall
i
do
with
that
man
she
reflected
i
don
know
whether
he
a
man
or
a
black
man
ef
he
a
man
i
oughter
go
tell
de
folks
up
at
de
big
house
an
dey
take
keer
of
if
he

black
man
i
oughter
go
tell
granny
he
don
look

a
black
man
somehow
er
nuther
an
yet
he
don
look
lack
a
man
he
too
dahk
an
his
hair
too
curly
but
i
mus
do
somethin
wid
he
ca

here
ter

in
de
woods
all
by
reckon
i
go
an
tell
granny
she
scaled
the
fence
caught
up
the
basket
of
peas
from
where
she
had
left
it
and
ran
lightly
and
swiftly
as
a
deer
toward
the
house
her
short
skirt
did
not
impede
her
progress
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
had
covered
the
half
mile
and
was
at
the
cabin
door
a
slight
heaving
of
her
full
and
yet
youthful
breast
being
the
only
sign
of
any
unusual
exertion
her
story
was
told
in
a
moment
the
old
woman
took
down
a
black
bottle
from
a
high
shelf
and
set
out
with
cicely
across
the
cornfield
toward
the
wounded
man
as
they
went
through
the
corn
cicely
recalled
part
of
her
dream
she
had
dreamed
that
under
some
strange
circumstances
what
they
had
been
was
still
obscure
she
had
met
a
young
man
a
young
man
whiter
than
she
and
yet
not
all
white
and
that
he
had
loved
her
and
courted
her
and
married
her
her
dream
had
been
all
the
sweeter
because
in
it
she
had
first
tasted
the
sweetness
of
love
and
she
had
not
recalled
it
before
because
only
in
her
dream
had
she
known
or
thought
of
love
as
something
supremely
desirable
with
the
memory
of
her
dream
however
her
fears
revived
dreams
were
solemn
things
to
cicely
the
fabric
of
a
vision
was
by
no
means
baseless
her
trouble
arose
from
her
not
being
able
to
recall
though
she
was
well
versed
in
just
what
event
was
foreshadowed
by
a
dream
of
finding
a
wounded
man
if
the
wounded
man
were
of
her
own
race
her
dream
would
thus
far
have
been
realized
and
having
met
the
young
man
the
other
joys
might
be
expected
to
follow
if
he
should
turn
out
to
be
a
white
man
then
her
dream
was
clearly
one
of
the
kind
that
go
by
contraries
and
she
could
expect
only
sorrow
and
trouble
and
pain
as
the
proper
sequences
of
this
fateful
discovery
ii
the
two
women
reached
the
fence
that
separated
the
cornfield
from
the
pine
woods
how

cicely
i
take

down
it
was
only
an
fence
and
it
was
a
matter
of
but
a
few
minutes
for
the
girl
to
lift
down
and
lay
to
either
side
the
ends
of
the
rails
that
formed
one
of
the
angles
this
done
the
old
woman
easily
stepped
across
the
remaining
two
or
three
rails
it
was
only
a
moment
before
they
stood
by
the
wounded
man
he
was
lying
still
breathing
regularly
and
seemingly
asleep
what
is
he
granny
asked
the
girl
anxiously
a
man

not

pushed
back
the
matted
hair
from
the
wounded

brow
and
looked
at
the
skin
beneath
it
was
fairer
there
but
yet
of
a
decided
brown
she
raised
his
hand
pushed
back
the
tattered
sleeve
from
his
wrist
and
then
she
laid
his
hand
down

lifted
the
sick
man
head
and
dinah
poured
a
few
drops
of
the
whiskey
between
his
teeth
he
swallowed
it
readily
enough
in
a
few
minutes
he
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
blankly
at
the
two
women
cicely
saw
that
his
eyes
were
large
and
black
and
glistening
with
fever
how

the
old
woman
there

no

the
wounded

kept
on
staring

suddenly
he
essayed
to

a
deep
groan
and
fell

cicely
lifted
the
wounded
man
by
the
arms
and
shoulders
she
was
strong
with
the
strength
of
youth
and
a
sturdy
race
the
man
was
pitifully
emaciated
how
much
the
two
women
had
not
suspected
until
they
raised
him
they
had
no
difficulty
whatever
except
for
the
awkwardness
of
such
a
burden
in
lifting
him
over
the
fence
and
carrying
him
through
the
cornfield
to
the
cabin
they
laid
him
on
cicely
bed
in
the
little
shed
that
formed
a
room
separate
from
the
main
apartment
of
the
cabin
the
old
woman
sent
cicely
to
cook
the
dinner
while
she
gave
her
own
attention
exclusively
to
the
still
unconscious
man
she
brought
water
and
washed
him
as
though
he
were

to
herself

she
made
a
bowl
of
gruel
and
fed
it
drop
by
drop
to
the
sick
man
this
roused
him
somewhat
from
his
stupor
but
when
dinah
thought
he
had
enough
of
the
gruel
and
stopped
feeding
him
he
closed
his
eyes
again
and
relapsed
into
a
heavy
sleep
that
was
so
closely
akin
to
unconsciousness
as
to
be
scarcely
distinguishable
from
it
when
old
needham
came
home
at
noon
his
wife
who
had
been
anxiously
awaiting
his
return
told
him
in
a
few
words
the
story
of
discovery
and
of
the
subsequent
events
needham
inspected
the
stranger
with
a
professional
eye
he
had
been
something
of
a
plantation
doctor
in
his
day
and
was
known
far
and
wide
for
his
knowledge
of
simple
remedies
the
negroes
all
around
as
well
as
many
of
the
poorer
white
people
came
to
him
for
the
treatment
of
common
ailments

needham
prophecy
proved
true
in
less
than
a
week
the
confederate
garrison
evacuated
the
arsenal
in
the
neighboring
town
of
patesville
blew
up
the
buildings
destroyed
the
ordnance
and
stores
and
retreated
across
the
cape
fear
river
burning
the
river
bridge
behind
them
two
acts
of
war
afterwards
unjustly
attributed
to
general
sherman
army
which
followed
close
upon
the
heels
of
the
retreating
confederates
when
there
was
no
longer
any
fear
for
the
stranger
safety
no
more
pains
were
taken
to
conceal
him
his
wound
had
healed
rapidly
and
in
a
week
he
had
been
able
with
some
help
to
climb
up
the
ladder
into
the
loft
in
all
this
time
however
though
apparently
conscious
he
had
said
no
word
to
any
one
nor
had
he
seemed
to
comprehend
a
word
that
was
spoken
to
him
cicely
had
been
his
constant
attendant
after
the
first
day
during
which
her
granny
had
nursed
him
she
had
sat
by
his
bedside
had
fanned
his
fevered
brow
had
held
food
and
water
and
medicine
to
his
lips
when
it
was
safe
for
him
to
come
down
from
the
loft
and
sit
in
a
chair
under
a
spreading
oak
cicely
supported
him
until
he
was
strong
enough
to
walk
about
the
yard
when
his
strength
had
increased
sufficiently
to
permit
of
greater
exertion
she
accompanied
him
on
long
rambles
in
the
fields
and
woods
in
spite
of
his
gain
in
physical
strength
the
newcomer
changed
very
little
in
other
respects
for
a
long
time
he
neither
spoke
nor
smiled
to
questions
put
to
him
he
simply
gave
no
reply
but
looked
at
his
questioner
with
the
blank
unconsciousness
of
an
infant
by
and
by
he
began
to
recognize
cicely
and
to
smile
at
her
approach
the
next
step
in
returning
consciousness
was
but
another
manifestation
of
the
same
sentiment
when
cicely
would
leave
him
he
would
look
his
regret
and
be
restless
and
uneasy
until
she
returned
the
family
were
at
a
loss
what
to
call
him
to
any
inquiry
as
to
his
name
he
answered
no
more
than
to
other
questions
he
come
jes
befo
sherman
said
needham
after
a
few
weeks
lack
john
de
baptis
befo
de
lawd
i
reckon
we
bettah
call
john
so
they
called
him
john
he
soon
learned
the
name
as
time
went
on
cicely
found
that
he
was
quick
at
learning
things
she
taught
him
to
speak
her
own
negro
english
which
he
pronounced
with
absolute
fidelity
to
her
intonations
so
that
barring
the
quality
of
his
voice
his
speech
was
an
echo
of
cicely
own
the
summer
wore
away
and
the
autumn
came
john
and
cicely
wandered
in
the
woods
together
and
gathered
walnuts
and
chinquapins
and
wild
grapes
when
harvest
time
came
they
worked
in
the
fields
side
by
side
plucked
the
corn
pulled
the
fodder
and
gathered
the
dried
peas
from
the
yellow
cicely
was
a
phenomenal
and
john
accompanied
her
to
the
fields
and
stayed
by
her
hours
at
a
time
though
occasionally
he
would
complain
of
his
head
and
sit
under
a
tree
and
rest
part
of
the
day
while
cicely
worked
the
two
keeping
one
another
always
in
sight
they
did
not
have
a
great
deal
of
intercourse
with
other
people
young
men
came
to
the
cabin
sometimes
to
see
cicely
but
when
they
found
her
entirely
absorbed
in
the
stranger
they
ceased
their
visits
for
a
time
cicely
kept
him
away
as
much
as
possible
from
others
because
she
did
not
wish
them
to
see
that
there
was
anything
wrong
about
him
this
was
her
motive
at
first
but
after
a
while
she
kept
him
to
herself
simply
because
she
was
happier
so
he
was
hers
hers
alone
she
had
found
him
as
pharaoh
daughter
had
found
moses
in
the
bulrushes
she
had
taught
him
to
speak
to
think
to
love
she
had
not
taught
him
to
remember
she
would
not
have
wished
him
to
she
would
have
been
jealous
of
any
past
to
which
he
might
have
proved
bound
by
other
ties
her
dream
so
far
had
come
true
she
had
found
him
he
loved
her
the
rest
of
it
would
as
surely
follow
and
that
before
long
for
dreams
were
serious
things
and
time
had
proved
hers
to
have
been
not
a
presage
of
misfortune
but
one
of
the
beneficent
visions
that
are
sent
that
we
may
enjoy
by
anticipation
the
good
things
that
are
in
store
for
us
iii
but
a
short
interval
of
time
elapsed
after
the
passage
of
the
warlike
host
that
swept
through
north
carolina
until
there
appeared
upon
the
scene
the
vanguard
of
a
second
army
which
came
to
bring
light
and
the
fruits
of
liberty
to
a
land
which
slavery
and
the
havoc
of
war
had
brought
to
ruin
it
is
fashionable
to
assume
that
those
who
undertook
the
political
rehabilitation
of
the
southern
states
merely
rounded
out
the
ruin
that
the
war
had
wrought
merely
ploughed
up
the
desolate
land
and
sowed
it
with
salt
perhaps
the
gentler
judgments
of
the
future
may
recognize
that
their
task
was
a
difficult
one
and
that
wiser
and
honester
men
might
have
failed
as
egregiously
it
may
even
in
time
be
conceded
that
some
good
came
out
of
the
governments
as
for
instance
the
establishment
of
a
system
of
popular
education
in
the
former
slave
states
where
it
had
been
a
crime
to
teach
people
to
read
or
write
a
schoolhouse
dotted
every
hillside
and
the
state
provided
education
for
rich
and
poor
for
white
and
black
alike
let
us
lay
at
least
this
token
upon
the
grave
of
the
the
evil
they
did
lives
after
them
and
the
statute
of
limitations
does
not
seem
to
run
against
it
it
is
but
just
that
we
should
not
forget
the
good
long
however
before
the
work
of
political
reconstruction
had
begun
a
brigade
of
yankee
schoolmasters
and
had
invaded
dixie
and
one
of
the
latter
had
opened
a
freedman
bureau
school
in
the
town
of
patesville
about
four
miles
from
needham
green
cabin
on
the
neighboring
sandhills
it
had
been
quite
a
surprise
to
miss
chandler
boston
friends
when
she
had
announced
her
intention
of
going
south
to
teach
the
freedmen
rich
accomplished
beautiful
and
a
social
favorite
she
was
giving
up
the
comforts
and
luxuries
of
northern
life
to
go
among
hostile
strangers
where
her
associates
would
be
mostly
ignorant
negroes
perhaps
she
might
meet
occasionally
an
officer
of
some
federal
garrison
or
a
traveler
from
the
north
but
to
all
intents
and
purposes
her
friends
considered
her
as
going
into
voluntary
exile
but
heroism
was
not
rare
in
those
days
and
martha
chandler
was
only
one
of
the
great
multitude
whose
hearts
went
out
toward
an
oppressed
race
and
who
freely
poured
out
their
talents
their
money
their
lives
whatever
god
had
given
them
in
the
sublime
and
not
unfruitful
effort
to
transform
three
millions
of
slaves
into
intelligent
freemen
miss
chandler
friends
knew
too
that
she
had
met
a
great
sorrow
and
more
than
suspected
that
out
of
it
had
grown
her
determination
to
go
south
when
cicely
green
heard
that
a
school
for
colored
people
had
been
opened
at
patesville
she
combed
her
hair
put
on
her
sunday
frock
and
such
bits
of
finery
as
she
possessed
and
set
out
for
town
early
the
next
monday
morning
there
were
many
who
came
to
learn
the
new
gospel
of
education
which
was
to
be
the
cure
for
all
the
freedmen
ills
the
old
and
the
man
and
woman
the
toddling
infant
they
came
to
acquire
the
new
and
wonderful
learning
that
was
to
make
them
the
equals
of
the
white
people
it
was
the
teacher
task
by
no
means
an
easy
one
to
select
from
this
incongruous
mass
the
most
promising
material
and
to
distribute
among
them
the
books
and
clothing
that
were
sent
largely
by
her
boston
friends
to
aid
her
in
her
work
to
find
out
what
they
knew
to
classify
them
by
their
intelligence
rather
than
by
their
knowledge
for
they
were
all
lamentably
ignorant
some
among
them
were
the
children
of
parents
who
had
been
free
before
the
war
and
of
these
some
few
could
read
and
one
or
two
could
write
one
paragon
who
could
repeat
the
multiplication
table
was
immediately
promoted
to
the
position
of
pupil
teacher
miss
chandler
took
a
liking
to
the
tall
girl
who
had
come
so
far
to
sit
under
her
instruction
there
was
a
fine
free
air
in
her
bearing
a
lightness
in
her
step
a
sparkle
in
her
eye
that
spoke
of
good
blood
whether
fused
by
nature
in
its
own
alembic
out
of
material
despised
and
spurned
of
men
or
whether
some
obscure
ancestral
strain
the
teacher
could
not
tell
the
girl
proved
intelligent
and
learned
rapidly
indeed
seemed
almost
feverishly
anxious
to
learn
she
was
quiet
and
was
though
utterly
untrained
instinctively
polite
and
profited
from
the
first
day
by
the
example
of
her
teacher
quiet
elegance
the
teacher
dressed
in
simple
black
when
cicely
came
back
to
school
the
second
day
she
had
left
off
her
glass
beads
and
her
red
ribbon
and
had
arranged
her
hair
as
nearly
like
the
teacher
as
her
skill
and
its
quality
would
permit
the
teacher
was
touched
by
these
efforts
at
imitation
and
by
the
intense
devotion
cicely
soon
manifested
toward
her
it
was
not
a
sycophantic
troublesome
devotion
that
made
itself
a
burden
to
its
object
it
found
expression
in
little
things
done
rather
than
in
any
words
the
girl
said
to
the
degree
that
the
attraction
was
mutual
martha
recognized
in
it
a
sort
of
freemasonry
of
temperament
that
drew
them
together
in
spite
of
the
differences
between
them
martha
felt
sometimes
in
the
vague
way
that
one
speculates
about
the
impossible
that
if
she
were
brown
and
had
been
brought
up
in
north
carolina
she
would
be
like
cicely
and
that
if
cicely
ancestors
had
come
over
in
the
mayflower
and
cicely
had
been
reared
on
beacon
street
in
the
shadow
of
the
state
house
dome
cicely
would
have
been
very
much
like
herself
miss
chandler
was
lonely
sometimes
her
duties
kept
her
occupied
all
day
on
sundays
she
taught
a
bible
class
in
the
schoolroom
correspondence
with
bureau
officials
and
friends
at
home
furnished
her
with
additional
occupation
at
times
nevertheless
she
felt
a
longing
for
the
company
of
women
of
her
own
race
but
the
white
ladies
of
the
town
did
not
call
even
in
the
most
formal
way
upon
the
yankee
miss
chandler
was
therefore
fain
to
do
the
best
she
could
with
such
companionship
as
was
available
she
took
cicely
to
her
home
occasionally
and
asked
her
once
to
stay
all
night
thinking
however
that
she
detected
a
reluctance
on
the
girl
part
to
remain
away
from
home
she
did
not
repeat
her
invitation
cicely
indeed
was
filling
a
double
rôle
the
learning
acquired
from
miss
chandler
she
imparted
to
john
at
home
every
evening
by
the
light
of
the
blazing
on
needham
ample
hearth
she
taught
john
to
read
the
simple
words
she
had
learned
during
the
day
why
she
did
not
take
him
to
school
she
had
never
asked
herself
there
were
several
other
pupils
as
old
as
he
seemed
to
be
perhaps
she
still
thought
it
necessary
to
protect
him
from
curious
remark
he
worked
with
needham
by
day
and
she
could
see
him
at
night
and
all
of
saturdays
and
sundays
perhaps
it
was
the
jealous
selfishness
of
love
she
had
found
him
he
was
hers
in
the
spring
when
school
was
over
her
granny
had
said
that
she
might
marry
him
till
then
her
dream
would
not
yet
have
come
true
and
she
must
keep
him
to
herself
and
yet
she
did
not
wish
him
to
lose
this
golden
key
to
the
avenues
of
opportunity
she
would
not
take
him
to
school
but
she
would
teach
him
each
day
all
that
she
herself
had
learned
he
was
not
difficult
to
teach
but
learned
indeed
with
what
seemed
to
cicely
marvelous
ease
always
however
by
her
lead
and
never
of
his
own
initiative
for
while
he
could
do
a
man
work
he
was
in
most
things
but
a
child
without
a
child
curiosity
his
love
for
cicely
appeared
the
only
thing
for
which
he
needed
no
suggestion
and
even
that
possessed
an
element
of
childish
dependence
that
would
have
seemed
to
minds
trained
to
thoughtful
observation
infinitely
pathetic
the
spring
came
and
time
the
children
began
to
drop
out
of
miss
chandler
school
one
by
one
as
their
services
were
required
at
home
cicely
was
among
those
who
intended
to
remain
in
school
until
the
term
closed
with
the
exhibition
in
which
she
was
assigned
a
leading
part
she
had
selected
her
recitation
or
speech
from
among
half
a
dozen
poems
that
her
teacher
had
suggested
and
to
memorizing
it
she
devoted
considerable
time
and
study
the
exhibition
as
the
first
of
its
kind
was
sure
to
be
a
notable
event
the
parents
and
friends
of
the
children
were
invited
to
attend
and
a
colored
church
recently
erected
the
largest
available
building
was
secured
as
the
place
where
the
exercises
should
take
place
on
the
morning
of
the
eventful
day
uncle
needham
assisted
by
john
harnessed
the
mule
to
the
cart
on
which
a
couple
of
chairs
were
fastened
to
accommodate
dinah
and
cicely
john
put
on
his
best
clothes
an
suit
of
blue
jeans
a
round
wool
hat
a
pair
of
coarse
brogans
a
homespun
shirt
and
a
bright
blue
necktie
cicely
wore
her
best
frock
a
red
ribbon
at
her
throat
another
in
her
hair
and
carried
a
bunch
of
flowers
in
her
hand
uncle
needham
and
aunt
dinah
were
also
in
holiday
array
needham
and
john
took
their
seats
on
opposite
sides
of
the
with
their
feet
dangling
down
and
thus
the
equipage
set
out
leisurely
for
the
town
cicely
had
long
looked
forward
impatiently
to
this
day
she
was
going
to
marry
john
the
next
week
and
then
her
dream
would
have
come
entirely
true
but
even
this
anticipated
happiness
did
not
overshadow
the
importance
of
the
present
occasion
which
would
be
an
epoch
in
her
life
a
day
of
joy
and
triumph
she
knew
her
speech
perfectly
and
timidity
was
not
one
of
her
weaknesses
she
knew
that
the
red
ribbons
set
off
her
dark
beauty
effectively
and
that
her
dress
fitted
neatly
the
curves
of
her
shapely
figure
she
confidently
expected
to
win
the
first
prize
a
large
bible
offered
by
miss
chandler
for
the
best
exercise
cicely
and
her
companions
soon
arrived
at
patesville
their
entrance
into
the
church
made
quite
a
sensation
for
cicely
was
not
only
an
acknowledged
belle
but
a
general
favorite
and
to
john
there
attached
a
tinge
of
mystery
which
inspired
a
respect
not
bestowed
upon
those
who
had
grown
up
in
the
neighborhood
cicely
secured
a
seat
in
the
front
part
of
the
church
next
to
the
aisle
in
the
place
reserved
for
the
pupils
as
the
house
was
already
partly
filled
by
townspeople
when
the
party
from
the
country
arrived
needham
and
his
wife
and
john
were
forced
to
content
themselves
with
places
somewhat
in
the
rear
of
the
room
from
which
they
could
see
and
hear
what
took
place
on
the
platform
but
where
they
were
not
at
all
conspicuously
visible
to
those
at
the
front
of
the
church
the
schoolmistress
had
not
yet
arrived
and
order
was
preserved
in
the
audience
by
two
of
the
elder
pupils
adorned
with
large
rosettes
of
red
white
and
blue
who
ushered
the
most
important
visitors
to
the
seats
reserved
for
them
a
national
flag
was
gracefully
draped
over
the
platform
and
under
it
hung
a
lithograph
of
the
great
emancipator
for
it
was
thus
these
people
thought
of
him
he
had
saved
the
union
but
the
union
had
never
meant
anything
good
to
them
he
had
proclaimed
liberty
to
the
captive
which
meant
all
to
them
and
to
them
he
was
and
would
ever
be
the
great
emancipator
the
schoolmistress
came
in
at
a
rear
door
and
took
her
seat
upon
the
platform
martha
was
dressed
in
white
for
once
she
had
laid
aside
the
sombre
garb
in
which
alone
she
had
been
seen
since
her
arrival
at
patesville
she
wore
a
yellow
rose
at
her
throat
a
bunch
of
jasmine
in
her
belt
a
sense
of
responsibility
for
the
success
of
the
exhibition
had
deepened
the
habitual
seriousness
of
her
face
yet
she
greeted
the
audience
with
a
smile
don
miss
look
sweet
whispered
the
little
girls
to
one
another
devouring
her
beauty
with
sparkling
eyes
their
lips

over

exclaimed
a
young
officer
who
belonged
to
the
federal
garrison
stationed
in
the
town
but
that
girl
is
a
beauty
the
speaker
and
a
companion
were
in
fatigue
uniform
and
had
merely
dropped
in
for
an
hour
between
garrison
duty
the
ushers
had
wished
to
give
them
seats
on
the
platform
but
they
had
declined
thinking
that
perhaps
their
presence
there
might
embarrass
the
teacher
they
sought
rather
to
avoid
observation
by
sitting
behind
a
pillar
in
the
rear
of
the
room
around
which
they
could
see
without
attracting
undue
attention
to
think
the
lieutenant
went
on
of
that
junonian
figure
those
lustrous
orbs
that
golden
coronal
that
flower
of
northern
civilization
being
wasted
on
these
barbarians
the
speaker
uttered
an
exaggerated
but
suppressed
groan
his
companion
a
young
man
of
face
and
serious
aspect
nodded
assent
but
whispered
reprovingly
some
one
will
hear
you
the
exercises
are
going
to
begin
when
miss
chandler
stepped
forward
to
announce
the
hymn
to
be
sung
by
the
school
as
the
first
exercise
every
eye
in
the
room
was
fixed
upon
her
except
john
which
saw
only
cicely
when
the
teacher
had
uttered
a
few
words
he
looked
up
to
her
and
from
that
moment
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
martha
face
after
the
singing
a
little
girl
dressed
in
white
crossed
by
ribbons
of
red
and
blue
recited
with
much
spirit
a
patriotic
poem
when
martha
announced
the
third
exercise
john
face
took
on
a
more
than
usually
animated
expression
and
there
was
a
perceptible
deepening
of
the
troubled
look
in
his
eyes
never
entirely
absent
since
cicely
had
found
him
in
the
woods
a
little
yellow
boy
with
long
curls
and
a
frightened
air
next
ascended
the
platform
now
jimmie
be
a
man
and
speak
right
out
whispered
his
teacher
tapping
his
arm
reassuringly
with
her
fan
as
he
passed
her
jimmie
essayed
to
recite
the
lines
so
familiar
to
a
past
generation
of
schoolchildren
i
knew
a
widow
very
poor
who
four
small
children
had
the
eldest
was
but
six
years
old
a
gentle
modest
lad
he
ducked
his
head
hurriedly
in
a
futile
attempt
at
a
bow
then
following
instructions
previously
given
him
fixed
his
eyes
upon
a
large
cardboard
motto
hanging
on
the
rear
wall
of
the
room
which
admonished
him
in
bright
red
letters
to
always
speak
the
truth
and
started
off
with
assumed
confidence
i
knew
a
widow
very
poor
who
at
this
point
drawn
by
an
irresistible
impulse
his
eyes
sought
the
level
of
the
audience
ah
fatal
blunder
he
stammered
but
with
an
effort
raised
his
eyes
and
began
again
i
knew
a
widow
very
poor
who
four
again
his
treacherous
eyes
fell
and
his
little
remaining
utterly
forsook
him
he
made
one
more
despairing
effort
i
knew
a
widow
very
poor
who
four
small
and
then
bursting
into
tears
turned
and
fled
amid
a
murmur
of
sympathy
jimmie
inglorious
retreat
was
covered
by
the
singing
in
chorus
of
the
banner
after
which
cicely
green
came
forward
to
recite
her
poem
by
jove
maxwell
whispered
the
young
officer
who
was
evidently
a
connoisseur
of
female
beauty
that
is
bad
for
a
bronze
venus
i
tell
you
said
the
other
keep
still
when
cicely
finished
her
recitation
the
young
officers
began
to
applaud
but
stopped
suddenly
in
some
confusion
as
they
realized
that
they
were
the
only
ones
in
the
audience
so
engaged
the
colored
people
had
either
not
learned
how
to
express
their
approval
in
orthodox
fashion
or
else
their
respect
for
the
sacred
character
of
the
edifice
forbade
any
such
demonstration
their
enthusiasm
found
vent
however
in
a
subdued
murmur
emphasized
by
numerous
nods
and
winks
and
suppressed
exclamations
during
the
singing
that
followed
cicely
recitation
the
two
officers
quietly
withdrew
their
duties
calling
them
away
at
this
hour
at
the
close
of
the
exercises
a
committee
on
prizes
met
in
the
vestibule
and
unanimously
decided
that
cicely
green
was
entitled
to
the
first
prize
proudly
erect
with
sparkling
eyes
and
cheeks
flushed
with
victory
cicely
advanced
to
the
platform
to
receive
the
coveted
reward
as
she
turned
away
her
eyes
shining
with
gratified
vanity
sought
those
of
her
lover
john
sat
bent
slightly
forward
in
an
attitude
of
strained
attention
and
cicely
triumph
lost
half
its
value
when
she
saw
that
it
was
not
at
her
but
at
miss
chandler
that
his
look
was
directed
though
she
watched
him
thenceforward
not
one
glance
did
he
vouchsafe
to
his
jealous
sweetheart
and
never
for
an
instant
withdrew
his
eyes
from
martha
or
relaxed
the
unnatural
intentness
of
his
gaze
the
imprisoned
mind
stirred
to
unwonted
effort
was
struggling
for
liberty
and
from
martha
had
come
the
first
ray
of
outer
light
that
had
penetrated
its
dungeon
before
the
audience
was
dismissed
the
teacher
rose
to
bid
her
school
farewell
her
intention
was
to
take
a
vacation
of
three
months
but
what
might
happen
in
that
time
she
did
not
know
and
there
were
duties
at
home
of
such
apparent
urgency
as
to
render
her
return
to
north
carolina
at
least
doubtful
so
that
in
her
own
heart
her
sounded
very
much
like
a
farewell
she
spoke
to
them
of
the
hopeful
progress
they
had
made
and
praised
them
for
their
eager
desire
to
learn
she
told
them
of
the
serious
duties
of
life
and
of
the
use
they
should
make
of
their
acquirements
with
prophetic
finger
she
pointed
them
to
the
upward
way
which
they
must
climb
with
patient
feet
to
raise
themselves
out
of
the
depths
then
an
unusual
thing
with
her
she
spoke
of
herself
her
heart
was
full
it
was
with
difficulty
that
she
maintained
her
composure
for
the
faces
that
confronted
her
were
kindly
faces
and
not
critical
and
some
of
them
she
had
learned
to
love
right
well
i
am
going
away
from
you
my
children
she
said
but
before
i
go
i
want
to
tell
you
how
i
came
to
be
in
north
carolina
so
that
if
i
have
been
able
to
do
anything
here
among
you
for
which
you
might
feel
inclined
in
your
good
nature
to
thank
me
you
may
thank
not
me
alone
but
another
who
came
before
me
and
whose
work
i
have
but
taken
up
where
laid
it
down
i
had
a
friend
a
dear
friend
why
should
i
be
ashamed
to
say
it
a
lover
to
whom
i
was
to
be
married
as
i
hope
all
you
girls
may
some
day
be
happily
married
his
country
needed
him
and
i
gave
him
up
he
came
to
fight
for
the
union
and
for
freedom
for
he
believed
that
all
men
are
brothers
he
did
not
come
back
again
he
gave
up
his
life
for
you
could
i
do
less
than
he
i
came
to
the
land
that
he
sanctified
by
his
death
and
i
have
tried
in
my
weak
way
to
tend
the
plant
he
watered
with
his
blood
and
which
in
the
fullness
of
time
will
blossom
forth
into
the
perfect
flower
of
liberty
she
could
say
no
more
and
as
the
whole
audience
thrilled
in
sympathy
with
her
emotion
there
was
a
hoarse
cry
from
the
men
side
of
the
room
and
john
forced
his
way
to
the
aisle
and
rushed
forward
to
the
platform
martha
martha
arthur
o
arthur
love
burst
the
of
despair
and
oblivion
and
caught
these
two
young
hearts
in
its
torrent
captain
arthur
carey
of
the
massachusetts
long
since
reported
missing
and
mourned
as
dead
was
restored
to
reason
and
to
his
world
it
seemed
to
him
but
yesterday
that
he
had
escaped
from
the
confederate
prison
at
salisbury
that
in
an
encounter
with
a
guard
he
had
received
a
wound
in
the
head
that
he
had
wandered
on
in
the
woods
keeping
himself
alive
by
means
of
wild
berries
with
now
and
then
a
piece
of
bread
or
a
potato
from
a
friendly
negro
it
seemed
but
the
night
before
that
he
had
laid
himself
down
tortured
with
fever
weak
from
loss
of
blood
and
with
no
hope
that
he
would
ever
rise
again
from
that
moment
his
memory
of
the
past
was
a
blank
until
he
recognized
martha
on
the
platform
and
took
up
again
the
thread
of
his
former
existence
where
it
had
been
broken
off
and
cicely
well
there
is
often
another
woman
and
cicely
all
unwittingly
to
carey
or
to
martha
had
been
the
other
woman
for
after
all
her
beautiful
dream
had
been
one
of
the
kind
that
go
by
contraries
the
passing
of
grandison
i
when
it
is
said
that
it
was
done
to
please
a
woman
there
ought
perhaps
to
be
enough
said
to
explain
anything
for
what
a
man
will
not
do
to
please
a
woman
is
yet
to
be
discovered
nevertheless
it
might
be
well
to
state
a
few
preliminary
facts
to
make
it
clear
why
young
dick
owens
tried
to
run
one
of
his
father
negro
men
off
to
canada
in
the
early
fifties
when
the
growth
of
sentiment
and
the
constant
drain
of
fugitive
slaves
into
the
north
had
so
alarmed
the
slaveholders
of
the
border
states
as
to
lead
to
the
passage
of
the
fugitive
slave
law
a
young
white
man
from
ohio
moved
by
compassion
for
the
sufferings
of
a
certain
bondman
who
happened
to
have
a
hard
master
essayed
to
help
the
slave
to
freedom
the
attempt
was
discovered
and
frustrated
the
abductor
was
tried
and
convicted
for
and
sentenced
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
in
the
penitentiary
his
death
after
the
expiration
of
only
a
small
part
of
the
sentence
from
cholera
contracted
while
nursing
stricken
fellow
prisoners
lent
to
the
case
a
melancholy
interest
that
made
it
famous
in
annals
dick
owens
had
attended
the
trial
he
was
a
youth
of
about
intelligent
handsome
and
amiable
but
extremely
indolent
in
a
graceful
and
gentlemanly
way
or
as
old
judge
fenderson
put
it
more
than
once
he
was
lazy
as
the
devil
a
mere
figure
of
speech
of
course
and
not
one
that
did
justice
to
the
enemy
of
mankind
when
asked
why
he
never
did
anything
serious
dick
would
reply
with
a
drawl
that
he
did
have
to
his
father
was
rich
there
was
but
one
other
child
an
unmarried
daughter
who
because
of
poor
health
would
probably
never
marry
and
dick
was
therefore
heir
presumptive
to
a
large
estate
wealth
or
social
position
he
did
not
need
to
seek
for
he
was
born
to
both
charity
lomax
had
shamed
him
into
studying
law
but
notwithstanding
an
hour
or
so
a
day
spent
at
old
judge
fenderson
office
he
did
not
make
remarkable
headway
in
his
legal
studies
what
dick
needs
said
the
judge
who
was
fond
of
tropes
as
became
a
scholar
and
of
horses
as
was
befitting
a
kentuckian
is
the
whip
of
necessity
or
the
spur
of
ambition
if
he
had
either
he
would
soon
need
the
snaffle
to
hold
him
back
but
all
dick
required
in
fact
to
prompt
him
to
the
most
remarkable
thing
he
accomplished
before
he
was
was
a
mere
suggestion
from
charity
lomax
the
story
was
never
really
known
to
but
two
persons
until
after
the
war
when
it
came
out
because
it
was
a
good
story
and
there
was
no
particular
reason
for
its
concealment
young
owens
had
attended
the
trial
of
this
or
martyr
either
or
both
and
when
it
was
over
had
gone
to
call
on
charity
lomax
and
while
they
sat
on
the
veranda
after
sundown
had
told
her
all
about
the
trial
he
was
a
good
talker
as
his
career
in
later
years
disclosed
and
described
the
proceedings
very
graphically
i
confess
he
admitted
that
while
my
principles
were
against
the
prisoner
my
sympathies
were
on
his
side
it
appeared
that
he
was
of
good
family
and
that
he
had
an
old
father
and
mother
respectable
people
dependent
upon
him
for
support
and
comfort
in
their
declining
years
he
had
been
led
into
the
matter
by
pity
for
a
negro
whose
master
ought
to
have
been
run
out
of
the
county
long
ago
for
abusing
his
slaves
if
it
had
been
merely
a
question
of
old
sam
briggs
negro
nobody
would
have
cared
anything
about
it
but
father
and
the
rest
of
them
stood
on
the
principle
of
the
thing
and
told
the
judge
so
and
the
fellow
was
sentenced
to
three
years
in
the
penitentiary
miss
lomax
had
listened
with
lively
interest
i
always
hated
old
sam
briggs
she
said
emphatically
ever
since
the
time
he
broke
a
negro
leg
with
a
piece
of
cordwood
when
i
hear
of
a
cruel
deed
it
makes
the
quaker
blood
that
came
from
my
grandmother
assert
itself
personally
i
wish
that
all
sam
briggs
negroes
would
run
away
as
for
the
young
man
i
regard
him
as
a
hero
he
dared
something
for
humanity
i
could
love
a
man
who
would
take
such
chances
for
the
sake
of
others
could
you
love
me
charity
if
i
did
something
heroic
you
never
will
dick
you
too
lazy
for
any
use
you
never
do
anything
harder
than
playing
cards
or
oh
come
now
sweetheart
i
been
courting
you
for
a
year
and
it
the
hardest
work
imaginable
are
you
never
going
to
love
me
he
pleaded
his
hand
sought
hers
but
she
drew
it
back
beyond
his
reach
i
never
love
you
dick
owens
until
you
have
done
something
when
that
time
comes
i
think
about
it
but
it
takes
so
long
to
do
anything
worth
mentioning
and
i
do
want
to
wait
one
must
read
two
years
to
become
a
lawyer
and
work
five
more
to
make
a
reputation
we
shall
both
be
gray
by
then
oh
i
do
know
she
rejoined
it
does
require
a
lifetime
for
a
man
to
prove
that
he
is
a
man
this
one
did
something
or
at
least
tried
to
well
i
willing
to
attempt
as
much
as
any
other
man
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
sweetheart
give
me
a
test
oh
dear
me
said
charity
i
do
care
what
you
so
you
do
really
come
to
think
of
it
why
should
i
care
whether
you
do
anything
or
not
i
sure
i
do
know
why
you
should
charity
rejoined
dick
humbly
for
i
aware
that
i
not
worthy
of
it
except
that
i
do
hate
she
added
relenting
slightly
to
see
a
really
clever
man
so
utterly
lazy
and
good
for
nothing
thank
you
my
dear
a
word
of
praise
from
you
has
sharpened
my
wits
already
i
have
an
idea
will
you
love
me
if
i
run
a
negro
off
to
canada
what
nonsense
said
charity
scornfully
you
must
be
losing
your
wits
steal
another
man
slave
indeed
while
your
father
owns
a
hundred
oh
there
be
no
trouble
about
that
responded
dick
lightly
i
run
off
one
of
the
old
man
we
got
too
many
anyway
it
may
not
be
quite
as
difficult
as
the
other
man
found
it
but
it
will
be
just
as
unlawful
and
will
demonstrate
what
i
am
capable
of
seeing
believing
replied
charity
of
course
what
you
are
talking
about
now
is
merely
absurd
i
going
away
for
three
weeks
to
visit
my
aunt
in
tennessee
if
you
able
to
tell
me
when
i
return
that
you
done
something
to
prove
your
quality
i
well
you
may
come
and
tell
me
about
it
ii
young
owens
got
up
about
nine
next
morning
and
while
making
his
toilet
put
some
questions
to
his
personal
attendant
a
rather
bright
looking
young
mulatto
of
about
his
own
age
tom
said
dick
yas
mars
dick
responded
the
servant
i
going
on
a
trip
north
would
you
like
to
go
with
me
now
if
there
was
anything
that
tom
would
have
liked
to
make
it
was
a
trip
north
it
was
something
he
had
long
contemplated
in
the
abstract
but
had
never
been
able
to
muster
up
sufficient
courage
to
attempt
in
the
concrete
he
was
prudent
enough
however
to
dissemble
his
feelings
i
would
min
it
mars
dick
ez
long
ez
you
take
keer
er
me
fetch
me
home
all
right
tom
eyes
belied
his
words
however
and
his
young
master
felt
well
assured
that
tom
needed
only
a
good
opportunity
to
make
him
run
away
having
a
comfortable
home
and
a
dismal
prospect
in
case
of
failure
tom
was
not
likely
to
take
any
desperate
chances
but
young
owens
was
satisfied
that
in
a
free
state
but
little
persuasion
would
be
required
to
lead
tom
astray
with
a
very
logical
and
characteristic
desire
to
gain
his
end
with
the
least
necessary
expenditure
of
effort
he
decided
to
take
tom
with
him
if
his
father
did
not
object
colonel
owens
had
left
the
house
when
dick
went
to
breakfast
so
dick
did
not
see
his
father
till
luncheon
father
he
remarked
casually
to
the
colonel
over
the
fried
chicken
i
feeling
a
trifle
run
down
i
imagine
my
health
would
be
improved
somewhat
by
a
little
travel
and
change
of
scene
why
do
you
take
a
trip
north
suggested
his
father
the
colonel
added
to
paternal
affection
a
considerable
respect
for
his
son
as
the
heir
of
a
large
estate
he
himself
had
been
raised
in
comparative
poverty
and
had
laid
the
foundations
of
his
fortune
by
hard
work
and
while
he
despised
the
ladder
by
which
he
had
climbed
he
could
not
entirely
forget
it
and
unconsciously
manifested
in
his
intercourse
with
his
son
some
of
the
poor
man
deference
toward
the
wealthy
and
i
think
i
adopt
your
suggestion
sir
replied
the
son
and
run
up
to
new
york
and
after
i
been
there
awhile
i
may
go
on
to
boston
for
a
week
or
so
i
never
been
there
you
know
there
are
some
matters
you
can
talk
over
with
my
factor
in
new
york
rejoined
the
colonel
and
while
you
are
up
there
among
the
yankees
i
hope
you
keep
your
eyes
and
ears
open
to
find
out
what
the
rascally
abolitionists
are
saying
and
doing
they
becoming
altogether
too
active
for
our
comfort
and
entirely
too
many
ungrateful
niggers
are
running
away
i
hope
the
conviction
of
that
fellow
yesterday
may
discourage
the
rest
of
the
breed
i
just
like
to
catch
any
one
trying
to
run
off
one
of
my
darkeys
he
get
short
shrift
i
do
think
any
court
would
have
a
chance
to
try
him
they
are
a
pestiferous
lot
assented
dick
and
dangerous
to
our
institutions
but
say
father
if
i
go
north
i
shall
want
to
take
tom
with
me
now
the
colonel
while
a
very
indulgent
father
had
pronounced
views
on
the
subject
of
negroes
having
studied
them
as
he
often
said
for
a
great
many
years
and
as
he
asserted
oftener
still
understanding
them
perfectly
it
is
scarcely
worth
while
to
say
either
that
he
valued
more
highly
than
if
he
had
inherited
them
the
slaves
he
had
toiled
and
schemed
for
i
do
think
it
safe
to
take
tom
up
north
he
declared
with
promptness
and
decision
he
a
good
enough
boy
but
too
smart
to
trust
among
those
abolitionists
i
strongly
suspect
him
of
having
learned
to
read
though
i
ca
imagine
how
i
saw
him
with
a
newspaper
the
other
day
and
while
he
pretended
to
be
looking
at
a
woodcut
i
almost
sure
he
was
reading
the
paper
i
think
it
by
no
means
safe
to
take
him
dick
did
not
insist
because
he
knew
it
was
useless
the
colonel
would
have
obliged
his
son
in
any
other
matter
but
his
negroes
were
the
outward
and
visible
sign
of
his
wealth
and
station
and
therefore
sacred
to
him
whom
do
you
think
it
safe
to
take
asked
dick
i
suppose
i
have
to
have
a
what
the
matter
with
grandison
suggested
the
colonel
he
handy
enough
and
i
reckon
we
can
trust
him
he
too
fond
of
good
eating
to
risk
losing
his
regular
meals
besides
he
sweet
on
your
maid
betty
and
i
promised
to
let
get
married
before
long
i
have
grandison
up
and
we
talk
to
him
here
you
boy
jack
called
the
colonel
to
a
yellow
youth
in
the
next
room
who
was
catching
flies
and
pulling
their
wings
off
to
pass
the
time
go
down
to
the
barn
and
tell
grandison
to
come
here
grandison
said
the
colonel
when
the
negro
stood
before
him
hat
in
hand
yas
marster
have
i
always
treated
you
right
yas
marster
have
you
always
got
all

wanted
to
eat

marster
and
as
much
whiskey
and
tobacco
as
was
good
for
you
grandison
marster
i
should
just
like
to
know
grandison
whether
you
do
think
yourself
a
great
deal
better
off
than
those
poor
free
negroes
down
by
the
plank
road
with
no
kind
master
to
look
after
them
and
no
mistress
to
give
them
medicine
when
they
sick
and
and
well
i
sh
jes
reckon
i
is
better
off
suh
dan
dem
free
niggers
suh
ef

ter
say
nobody

erbout
it
anybody
ax
me
who
i
ter
i
got
no
ter
be
shame
ter
tell
no
suh
i
ain
suh
the
colonel
was
beaming
this
was
true
gratitude
and
his
feudal
heart
thrilled
at
such
appreciative
homage
what
heartless
monsters
they
were
who
would
break
up
this
blissful
relationship
of
kindly
protection
on
the
one
hand
of
wise
subordination
and
loyal
dependence
on
the
other
the
colonel
always
became
indignant
at
the
mere
thought
of
such
wickedness
grandison
the
colonel
continued
your
young
master
dick
is
going
north
for
a
few
weeks
and
i
am
thinking
of
letting
him
take
you
along
i
shall
send
you
on
this
trip
grandison
in
order
that
you
may
take
care
of
your
young
master
he
will
need
some
one
to
wait
on
him
and
no
one
can
ever
do
it
so
well
as
one
of
the
boys
brought
up
with
him
on
the
old
plantation
i
am
going
to
trust
him
in
your
hands
and
i
sure
you
do
your
duty
faithfully
and
bring
him
back
home
safe
and
sound
to
old
kentucky
grandison
grinned
oh
yas
marster
i
take
keer
er
young
mars
dick
i
want
to
warn
you
though
grandison
continued
the
colonel
impressively
against
these
cussed
abolitionists
who
try
to
entice
servants
from
their
comfortable
homes
and
their
indulgent
masters
from
the
blue
skies
the
green
fields
and
the
warm
sunlight
of
their
southern
home
and
send
them
away
off
yonder
to
canada
a
dreary
country
where
the
woods
are
full
of
wildcats
and
wolves
and
bears
where
the
snow
lies
up
to
the
eaves
of
the
houses
for
six
months
of
the
year
and
the
cold
is
so
severe
that
it
freezes
your
breath
and
curdles
your
blood
and
where
when
runaway
niggers
get
sick
and
ca
work
they
are
turned
out
to
starve
and
die
unloved
and
uncared
for
i
reckon
grandison
that
you
have
too
much
sense
to
permit
yourself
to
be
led
astray
by
any
such
foolish
and
wicked
people
suh
i

grandison
replied
the
colonel
chuckling
hit
as
hard
as
you
can
i
reckon
they
rather
like
it
begad
i
believe
they
would
it
would
serve
right
to
be
hit
by
a
nigger
er
ef

continued
grandison
reflectively
i
tell

jes

oh
yes
grandison
your

marster
asked
the
negro
with
sudden
alarm
i
do
know
grandison
replied
the
colonel
lighting
a
fresh
cigar
they
a
desperate
set
of
lunatics
and
there
no
telling
what
they
may
resort
to
but
if
you
stick
close
to
your
young
master
and
remember
always
that
he
is
your
best
friend
and
understands
your
real
needs
and
has
your
true
interests
at
heart
and
if
you
will
be
careful
to
avoid
strangers
who
try
to
talk
to
you
you
stand
a
fair
chance
of
getting
back
to
your
home
and
your
friends
and
if
you
please
your
master
dick
he
buy
you
a
present
and
a
string
of
beads
for

grandison

iii
richard
owens
and
servant
from
kentucky
registered
at
the
fashionable
new
york
hostelry
for
southerners
in
those
days
a
hotel
where
an
atmosphere
congenial
to
southern
institutions
was
sedulously
maintained
but
there
were
negro
waiters
in
the
and
mulatto
and
dick
had
no
doubt
that
grandison
with
the
native
gregariousness
and
garrulousness
of
his
race
would
foregather
and
palaver
with
them
sooner
or
later
and
dick
hoped
that
they
would
speedily
inoculate
him
with
the
virus
of
freedom
for
it
was
not
intention
to
say
anything
to
his
servant
about
his
plan
to
free
him
for
obvious
reasons
to
mention
one
of
them
if
grandison
should
go
away
and
by
legal
process
be
recaptured
his
young
master
part
in
the
matter
would
doubtless
become
known
which
would
be
embarrassing
to
dick
to
say
the
least
if
on
the
other
hand
he
should
merely
give
grandison
sufficient
latitude
he
had
no
doubt
he
would
eventually
lose
him
for
while
not
exactly
skeptical
about
grandison
perfervid
loyalty
dick
had
been
a
somewhat
keen
observer
of
human
nature
in
his
own
indolent
way
and
based
his
expectations
upon
the
force
of
the
example
and
argument
that
his
servant
could
scarcely
fail
to
encounter
grandison
should
have
a
fair
chance
to
become
free
by
his
own
initiative
if
it
should
become
necessary
to
adopt
other
measures
to
get
rid
of
him
it
would
be
time
enough
to
act
when
the
necessity
arose
and
dick
owens
was
not
the
youth
to
take
needless
trouble
the
young
master
renewed
some
acquaintances
and
made
others
and
spent
a
week
or
two
very
pleasantly
in
the
best
society
of
the
metropolis
easily
accessible
to
a
wealthy
young
southerner
with
proper
introductions
young
women
smiled
on
him
and
young
men
of
convivial
habits
pressed
their
hospitalities
but
the
memory
of
charity
sweet
strong
face
and
clear
blue
eyes
made
him
proof
against
the
blandishments
of
the
one
sex
and
the
persuasions
of
the
other
meanwhile
he
kept
grandison
supplied
with
and
left
him
mainly
to
his
own
devices
every
night
when
dick
came
in
he
hoped
he
might
have
to
wait
upon
himself
and
every
morning
he
looked
forward
with
pleasure
to
the
prospect
of
making
his
toilet
unaided
his
hopes
however
were
doomed
to
disappointment
for
every
night
when
he
came
in
grandison
was
on
hand
with
a
bootjack
and
a
nightcap
mixed
for
his
young
master
as
the
colonel
had
taught
him
to
mix
it
and
every
morning
grandison
appeared
with
his
master
boots
blacked
and
his
clothes
brushed
and
laid
his
linen
out
for
the
day
grandison
said
dick
one
morning
after
finishing
his
toilet
this
is
the
chance
of
your
life
to
go
around
among
your
own
people
and
see
how
they
live
have
you
met
any
of
them
yas
suh
i
seen
some
of
but
i
don
keer
nuffin

but
dey
ain
got
sense
ter
know
dey
ain
half
as
well
off
as
dey
would
be
down
souf
whar
dey
be
when
two
weeks
had
passed
without
any
apparent
effect
of
evil
example
upon
grandison
dick
resolved
to
go
on
to
boston
where
he
thought
the
atmosphere
might
prove
more
favorable
to
his
ends
after
he
had
been
at
the
revere
house
for
a
day
or
two
without
losing
grandison
he
decided
upon
slightly
different
tactics
having
ascertained
from
a
city
directory
the
addresses
of
several
abolitionists
he
wrote
them
each
a
letter
something
like
this
dear
friend
and
brother
a
wicked
slaveholder
from
kentucky
stopping
at
the
revere
house
has
dared
to
insult
the
people
of
boston
by
bringing
his
slave
into
their
midst
shall
this
be
tolerated
or
shall
steps
be
taken
in
the
name
of
liberty
to
rescue
a
from
bondage
for
obvious
reasons
i
can
only
sign
myself
a
friend
of
humanity
that
his
letter
might
have
an
opportunity
to
prove
effective
dick
made
it
a
point
to
send
grandison
away
from
the
hotel
on
various
errands
on
one
of
these
occasions
dick
watched
him
for
quite
a
distance
down
the
street
grandison
had
scarcely
left
the
hotel
when
a
man
came
out
behind
him
followed
him
soon
overtook
him
and
kept
along
beside
him
until
they
turned
the
next
corner
hopes
were
roused
by
this
spectacle
but
sank
correspondingly
when
grandison
returned
to
the
hotel
as
grandison
said
nothing
about
the
encounter
dick
hoped
there
might
be
some
behind
this
unexpected
reticence
the
results
of
which
might
develop
later
on
but
grandison
was
on
hand
again
when
his
master
came
back
to
the
hotel
at
night
and
was
in
attendance
again
in
the
morning
with
hot
water
to
assist
at
his
master
toilet
dick
sent
him
on
further
errands
from
day
to
day
and
upon
one
occasion
came
squarely
up
to
him
inadvertently
of
course
while
grandison
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
a
young
white
man
in
clerical
garb
when
grandison
saw
dick
approaching
he
edged
away
from
the
preacher
and
hastened
toward
his
master
with
a
very
evident
expression
of
relief
upon
his
countenance
mars
dick
he
said
dese
yer
abolitioners
is
jes
pesterin

tryin
ter

no
suh

is
we
gwine
back
home
long
mars
dick
we
be
going
back
soon
enough
replied
dick
somewhat
shortly
while
he
inwardly
cursed
the
stupidity
of
a
slave
who
could
be
free
and
would
not
and
registered
a
secret
vow
that
if
he
were
unable
to
get
rid
of
grandison
without
assassinating
him
and
were
therefore
compelled
to
take
him
back
to
kentucky
he
would
see
that
grandison
got
a
taste
of
an
article
of
slavery
that
would
make
him
regret
his
wasted
opportunities
meanwhile
he
determined
to
tempt
his
servant
yet
more
strongly
grandison
he
said
next
morning
i
going
away
for
a
day
or
two
but
i
shall
leave
you
here
i
shall
lock
up
a
hundred
dollars
in
this
drawer
and
give
you
the
key
if
you
need
any
of
it
use
it
and
enjoy
yourself
spend
it
all
if
you
like
for
this
is
probably
the
last
chance
you
have
for
some
time
to
be
in
a
free
state
and
you
better
enjoy
your
liberty
while
you
may
when
he
came
back
a
couple
of
days
later
and
found
the
faithful
grandison
at
his
post
and
the
hundred
dollars
intact
dick
felt
seriously
annoyed
his
vexation
was
increased
by
the
fact
that
he
could
not
express
his
feelings
adequately
he
did
not
even
scold
grandison
how
could
he
indeed
find
fault
with
one
who
so
sensibly
recognized
his
true
place
in
the
economy
of
civilization
and
kept
it
with
such
touching
fidelity
i
ca
say
a
thing
to
him
groaned
dick
he
deserves
a
leather
medal
made
out
of
his
own
hide
tanned
i
reckon
i
write
to
father
and
let
him
know
what
a
model
servant
he
has
given
me
he
wrote
his
father
a
letter
which
made
the
colonel
swell
with
pride
and
pleasure
i
really
think
the
colonel
observed
to
one
of
his
friends
that
dick
ought
to
have
the
nigger
interviewed
by
the
boston
papers
so
that
they
may
see
how
contented
and
happy
our
darkeys
really
are
dick
also
wrote
a
long
letter
to
charity
lomax
in
which
he
said
among
many
other
things
that
if
she
knew
how
hard
he
was
working
and
under
what
difficulties
to
accomplish
something
serious
for
her
sake
she
would
no
longer
keep
him
in
suspense
but
overwhelm
him
with
love
and
admiration
having
thus
exhausted
without
result
the
more
obvious
methods
of
getting
rid
of
grandison
and
diplomacy
having
also
proved
a
failure
dick
was
forced
to
consider
more
radical
measures
of
course
he
might
run
away
himself
and
abandon
grandison
but
this
would
be
merely
to
leave
him
in
the
united
states
where
he
was
still
a
slave
and
where
with
his
notions
of
loyalty
he
would
speedily
be
reclaimed
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
accomplish
the
purpose
of
his
trip
to
the
north
to
leave
grandison
permanently
in
canada
where
he
would
be
legally
free
i
might
extend
my
trip
to
canada
he
reflected
but
that
would
be
too
palpable
i
have
it
i
visit
niagara
falls
on
the
way
home
and
lose
him
on
the
canada
side
when
he
once
realizes
that
he
is
actually
free
i
warrant
that
he
stay
so
the
next
day
saw
them
westward
bound
and
in
due
course
of
time
by
the
somewhat
slow
conveyances
of
the
period
they
found
themselves
at
niagara
dick
walked
and
drove
about
the
falls
for
several
days
taking
grandison
along
with
him
on
most
occasions
one
morning
they
stood
on
the
canadian
side
watching
the
wild
whirl
of
the
waters
below
them
grandison
said
dick
raising
his
voice
above
the
roar
of
the
cataract
do
you
know
where
you
are
now
i
wid
you
mars
dick
dat
all
i
keers
you
are
now
in
canada
grandison
where
your
people
go
when
they
run
away
from
their
masters
if
you
wished
grandison
you
might
walk
away
from
me
this
very
minute
and
i
could
not
lay
my
hand
upon
you
to
take
you
back
grandison
looked
around
uneasily
let
go
back
ober

i

be
able
to

no
mo
discouraged
but
not
yet
hopeless
dick
said
a
few
minutes
later
grandison
i
going
up
the
road
a
bit
to
the
inn
over
yonder
you
stay
here
until
i
return
i
not
be
gone
a
great
while
grandison
eyes
opened
wide
and
he
looked
somewhat
fearful
is
dey
any
er
dem
dadblasted
abolitioners
roun
heah
mars
dick
i
do
imagine
that
there
are
replied
his
master
hoping
there
might
be
but
i
not
afraid
of
running
away
grandison
i
only
wish
i
were
he
added
to
himself
dick
walked
leisurely
down
the
road
to
where
the
whitewashed
inn
built
of
stone
with
true
british
solidity
loomed
up
through
the
trees
by
the
roadside
arrived
there
he
ordered
a
glass
of
ale
and
a
sandwich
and
took
a
seat
at
a
table
by
a
window
from
which
he
could
see
grandison
in
the
distance
for
a
while
he
hoped
that
the
seed
he
had
sown
might
have
fallen
on
fertile
ground
and
that
grandison
relieved
from
the
restraining
power
of
a
master
eye
and
finding
himself
in
a
free
country
might
get
up
and
walk
away
but
the
hope
was
vain
for
grandison
remained
faithfully
at
his
post
awaiting
his
master
return
he
had
seated
himself
on
a
broad
flat
stone
and
turning
his
eyes
away
from
the
grand
and
spectacle
that
lay
close
at
hand
was
looking
anxiously
toward
the
inn
where
his
master
sat
cursing
his
fidelity
by
and
by
a
girl
came
into
the
room
to
serve
his
order
and
dick
very
naturally
glanced
at
her
and
as
she
was
young
and
pretty
and
remained
in
attendance
it
was
some
minutes
before
he
looked
for
grandison
when
he
did
so
his
faithful
servant
had
disappeared
to
pay
his
reckoning
and
go
away
without
the
change
was
a
matter
quickly
accomplished
retracing
his
footsteps
toward
the
falls
he
saw
to
his
great
disgust
as
he
approached
the
spot
where
he
had
left
grandison
the
familiar
form
of
his
servant
stretched
out
on
the
ground
his
face
to
the
sun
his
mouth
open
sleeping
the
time
away
oblivious
alike
to
the
grandeur
of
the
scenery
the
thunderous
roar
of
the
cataract
or
the
insidious
voice
of
sentiment
grandison
soliloquized
his
master
as
he
stood
gazing
down
at
his
ebony
encumbrance
i
do
not
deserve
to
be
an
american
citizen
i
ought
not
to
have
the
advantages
i
possess
over
you
and
i
certainly
am
not
worthy
of
charity
lomax
if
i
am
not
smart
enough
to
get
rid
of
you
i
have
an
idea
you
shall
yet
be
free
and
i
will
be
the
instrument
of
your
deliverance
sleep
on
faithful
and
affectionate
servitor
and
dream
of
the
blue
grass
and
the
bright
skies
of
old
kentucky
for
it
is
only
in
your
dreams
that
you
will
ever
see
them
again
dick
retraced
his
footsteps
towards
the
inn
the
young
woman
chanced
to
look
out
of
the
window
and
saw
the
handsome
young
gentleman
she
had
waited
on
a
few
minutes
before
standing
in
the
road
a
short
distance
away
apparently
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
with
a
colored
man
employed
as
hostler
for
the
inn
she
thought
she
saw
something
pass
from
the
white
man
to
the
other
but
at
that
moment
her
duties
called
her
away
from
the
window
and
when
she
looked
out
again
the
young
gentleman
had
disappeared
and
the
hostler
with
two
other
young
men
of
the
neighborhood
one
white
and
one
colored
were
walking
rapidly
towards
the
falls
iv
dick
made
the
journey
homeward
alone
and
as
rapidly
as
the
conveyances
of
the
day
would
permit
as
he
drew
near
home
his
conduct
in
going
back
without
grandison
took
on
a
more
serious
aspect
than
it
had
borne
at
any
previous
time
and
although
he
had
prepared
the
colonel
by
a
letter
sent
several
days
ahead
there
was
still
the
prospect
of
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
with
him
not
indeed
that
his
father
would
upbraid
him
but
he
was
likely
to
make
searching
inquiries
and
notwithstanding
the
vein
of
quiet
recklessness
that
had
carried
dick
through
his
preposterous
scheme
he
was
a
very
poor
liar
having
rarely
had
occasion
or
inclination
to
tell
anything
but
the
truth
any
reluctance
to
meet
his
father
was
more
than
offset
however
by
a
stronger
force
drawing
him
homeward
for
charity
lomax
must
long
since
have
returned
from
her
visit
to
her
aunt
in
tennessee
dick
got
off
easier
than
he
had
expected
he
told
a
straight
story
and
a
truthful
one
so
far
as
it
went
the
colonel
raged
at
first
but
rage
soon
subsided
into
anger
and
anger
moderated
into
annoyance
and
annoyance
into
a
sort
of
garrulous
sense
of
injury
the
colonel
thought
he
had
been
hardly
used
he
had
trusted
this
negro
and
he
had
broken
faith
yet
after
all
he
did
not
blame
grandison
so
much
as
he
did
the
abolitionists
who
were
undoubtedly
at
the
bottom
of
it
as
for
charity
lomax
dick
told
her
privately
of
course
that
he
had
run
his
father
man
grandison
off
to
canada
and
left
him
there
oh
dick
she
had
said
with
shuddering
alarm
what
have
you
done
if
they
knew
it
they
send
you
to
the
penitentiary
like
they
did
that
yankee
but
they
do
know
it
he
had
replied
seriously
adding
with
an
injured
tone
you
do
seem
to
appreciate
my
heroism
like
you
did
that
of
the
yankee
perhaps
it
because
i
was
caught
and
sent
to
the
penitentiary
i
thought
you
wanted
me
to
do
it
why
dick
owens
she
exclaimed
you
know
i
never
dreamed
of
any
such
outrageous
proceeding
but
i
presume
i
have
to
marry
you
she
concluded
after
some
insistence
on
dick
part
if
only
to
take
care
of
you
you
are
too
reckless
for
anything
and
a
man
who
goes
chasing
all
over
the
north
being
entertained
by
new
york
and
boston
society
and
having
negroes
to
throw
away
needs
some
one
to
look
after
him
it
a
most
remarkable
thing
replied
dick
fervently
that
your
views
correspond
exactly
with
my
profoundest
convictions
it
proves
beyond
question
that
we
were
made
for
one
another
they
were
married
three
weeks
later
as
each
of
them
had
just
returned
from
a
journey
they
spent
their
honeymoon
at
home
a
week
after
the
wedding
they
were
seated
one
afternoon
on
the
piazza
of
the
colonel
house
where
dick
had
taken
his
bride
when
a
negro
from
the
yard
ran
down
the
lane
and
threw
open
the
big
gate
for
the
colonel
buggy
to
enter
the
colonel
was
not
alone
beside
him
ragged
and
bowed
with
weariness
and
upon
his
face
a
haggard
look
that
told
of
hardship
and
privation
sat
the
lost
grandison
the
colonel
alighted
at
the
steps
take
the
lines
tom
he
said
to
the
man
who
had
opened
the
gate
and
drive
round
to
the
barn
help
grandison
down
poor
devil
he
so
stiff
he
can
hardly
move
and
get
a
tub
of
water
and
wash
him
and
rub
him
down
and
feed
him
and
give
him
a
big
drink
of
whiskey
and
then
let
him
come
round
and
see
his
young
master
and
his
new
mistress
the
colonel
face
wore
an
expression
compounded
of
joy
and
indignation
joy
at
the
restoration
of
a
valuable
piece
of
property
indignation
for
reasons
he
proceeded
to
state
it
astounding
the
depths
of
depravity
the
human
heart
is
capable
of
i
was
coming
along
the
road
three
miles
away
when
i
heard
some
one
call
me
from
the
roadside
i
pulled
up
the
mare
and
who
should
come
out
of
the
woods
but
grandison
the
poor
nigger
could
hardly
crawl
along
with
the
help
of
a
broken
limb
i
was
never
more
astonished
in
my
life
you
could
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
he
seemed
pretty
far
gone
he
could
hardly
talk
above
a
whisper
and
i
had
to
give
him
a
mouthful
of
whiskey
to
brace
him
up
so
he
could
tell
his
story
it
just
as
i
thought
from
the
beginning
dick
grandison
had
no
notion
of
running
away
he
knew
when
he
was
well
off
and
where
his
friends
were
all
the
persuasions
of
abolition
liars
and
runaway
niggers
did
not
move
him
but
the
desperation
of
those
fanatics
knew
no
bounds
their
guilty
consciences
gave
them
no
rest
they
got
the
notion
somehow
that
grandison
belonged
to
a
and
had
been
brought
north
as
a
spy
to
help
capture
ungrateful
runaway
servants
they
actually
kidnaped
him
just
think
of
it
and
gagged
him
and
bound
him
and
threw
him
rudely
into
a
wagon
and
carried
him
into
the
gloomy
depths
of
a
canadian
forest
and
locked
him
in
a
lonely
hut
and
fed
him
on
bread
and
water
for
three
weeks
one
of
the
scoundrels
wanted
to
kill
him
and
persuaded
the
others
that
it
ought
to
be
done
but
they
got
to
quarreling
about
how
they
should
do
it
and
before
they
had
their
minds
made
up
grandison
escaped
and
keeping
his
back
steadily
to
the
north
star
made
his
way
after
suffering
incredible
hardships
back
to
the
old
plantation
back
to
his
master
his
friends
and
his
home
why
it
as
good
as
one
of
scott
novels
simms
or
some
other
one
of
our
southern
authors
ought
to
write
it
up
do
you
think
sir
suggested
dick
who
had
calmly
smoked
his
cigar
throughout
the
colonel
animated
recital
that
that
kidnaping
yarn
sounds
a
little
improbable
is
there
some
more
likely
explanation
nonsense
dick
it
the
gospel
truth
those
infernal
abolitionists
are
capable
of
anything
everything
just
think
of
their
locking
the
poor
faithful
nigger
up
beating
him
kicking
him
depriving
him
of
his
liberty
keeping
him
on
bread
and
water
for
three
long
lonesome
weeks
and
he
all
the
time
pining
for
the
old
plantation
there
were
almost
tears
in
the
colonel
eyes
at
the
picture
of
grandison
sufferings
that
he
conjured
up
dick
still
professed
to
be
slightly
skeptical
and
met
charity
severely
questioning
eye
with
bland
unconsciousness
the
colonel
killed
the
fatted
calf
for
grandison
and
for
two
or
three
weeks
the
returned
wanderer
life
was
a
slave
dream
of
pleasure
his
fame
spread
throughout
the
county
and
the
colonel
gave
him
a
permanent
place
among
the
house
servants
where
he
could
always
have
him
conveniently
at
hand
to
relate
his
adventures
to
admiring
visitors
about
three
weeks
after
grandison
return
the
colonel
faith
in
sable
humanity
was
rudely
shaken
and
its
foundations
almost
broken
up
he
came
near
losing
his
belief
in
the
fidelity
of
the
negro
to
his
master
the
servile
virtue
most
highly
prized
and
most
sedulously
cultivated
by
the
colonel
and
his
kind
one
monday
morning
grandison
was
missing
and
not
only
grandison
but
his
wife
betty
the
maid
his
mother
aunt
eunice
his
father
uncle
ike
his
brothers
tom
and
john
and
his
little
sister
elsie
were
likewise
absent
from
the
plantation
and
a
hurried
search
and
inquiry
in
the
neighborhood
resulted
in
no
information
as
to
their
whereabouts
so
much
valuable
property
could
not
be
lost
without
an
effort
to
recover
it
and
the
wholesale
nature
of
the
transaction
carried
consternation
to
the
hearts
of
those
whose
ledgers
were
chiefly
bound
in
black
extremely
energetic
measures
were
taken
by
the
colonel
and
his
friends
the
fugitives
were
traced
and
followed
from
point
to
point
on
their
northward
run
through
ohio
several
times
the
hunters
were
close
upon
their
heels
but
the
magnitude
of
the
escaping
party
begot
unusual
vigilance
on
the
part
of
those
who
sympathized
with
the
fugitives
and
strangely
enough
the
underground
railroad
seemed
to
have
had
its
tracks
cleared
and
signals
set
for
this
particular
train
once
twice
the
colonel
thought
he
had
them
but
they
slipped
through
his
fingers
one
last
glimpse
he
caught
of
his
vanishing
property
as
he
stood
accompanied
by
a
united
states
marshal
on
a
wharf
at
a
port
on
the
south
shore
of
lake
erie
on
the
stern
of
a
small
steamboat
which
was
receding
rapidly
from
the
wharf
with
her
nose
pointing
toward
canada
there
stood
a
group
of
familiar
dark
faces
and
the
look
they
cast
backward
was
not
one
of
longing
for
the
fleshpots
of
egypt
the
colonel
saw
grandison
point
him
out
to
one
of
the
crew
of
the
vessel
who
waved
his
hand
derisively
toward
the
colonel
the
latter
shook
his
fist
impotently
and
the
incident
was
closed
uncle
wellington
wives
i
uncle
wellington
braboy
was
so
deeply
absorbed
in
thought
as
he
walked
slowly
homeward
from
the
weekly
meeting
of
the
union
league
that
he
let
his
pipe
go
out
a
fact
of
which
he
remained
oblivious
until
he
had
reached
the
little
frame
house
in
the
suburbs
of
patesville
where
he
lived
with
aunt
milly
his
wife
on
this
particular
occasion
the
club
had
been
addressed
by
a
visiting
brother
from
the
north
professor
patterson
a
tall
mulatto
who
wore
a
perfectly
fitting
suit
of
broadcloth
a
shiny
silk
hat
and
linen
of
dazzling
whiteness
in
short
a
gentleman
of
such
distinguished
appearance
that
the
doors
and
windows
of
the
offices
and
stores
on
front
street
were
filled
with
curious
observers
as
he
passed
through
that
thoroughfare
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
this
polished
stranger
was
a
traveling
organizer
of
masonic
lodges
but
he
also
claimed
to
be
a
high
officer
in
the
union
league
and
had
been
invited
to
lecture
before
the
local
chapter
of
that
organization
at
patesville
the
lecture
had
been
largely
attended
and
wellington
braboy
had
occupied
a
seat
just
in
front
of
the
platform
the
subject
of
the
lecture
was
the
mental
moral
physical
political
social
and
financial
improvement
of
the
negro
race
in
america
a
theme
much
dwelt
upon
with
slight
variations
by
colored
orators
for
to
this
struggling
people
then
as
now
the
problem
of
their
uncertain
present
and
their
doubtful
future
was
the
chief
concern
of
life
the
period
was
the
hopeful
one
the
federal
government
retained
some
vestige
of
authority
in
the
south
and
the
newly
emancipated
race
cherished
the
delusion
that
under
the
constitution
that
enduring
rock
on
which
our
liberties
are
founded
and
under
the
equal
laws
it
purported
to
guarantee
they
would
enter
upon
the
era
of
freedom
and
opportunity
which
their
northern
friends
had
inaugurated
with
such
solemn
sanctions
the
speaker
pictured
in
eloquent
language
the
state
of
ideal
equality
and
happiness
enjoyed
by
colored
people
at
the
north
how
they
sent
their
children
to
school
with
the
white
children
how
they
sat
by
white
people
in
the
churches
and
theatres
ate
with
them
in
the
public
restaurants
and
buried
their
dead
in
the
same
cemeteries
the
professor
waxed
eloquent
with
the
development
of
his
theme
and
as
a
finishing
touch
to
an
alluring
picture
assured
the
excited
audience
that
the
intermarriage
of
the
races
was
common
and
that
he
himself
had
espoused
a
white
woman
uncle
wellington
braboy
was
a
deeply
interested
listener
he
had
heard
something
of
these
facts
before
but
his
information
had
always
come
in
such
vague
and
questionable
shape
that
he
had
paid
little
attention
to
it
he
knew
that
the
yankees
had
freed
the
slaves
and
that
runaway
negroes
had
always
gone
to
the
north
to
seek
liberty
any
such
equality
however
as
the
visiting
brother
had
depicted
was
more
than
uncle
wellington
had
ever
conceived
as
actually
existing
anywhere
in
the
world
at
first
he
felt
inclined
to
doubt
the
truth
of
the
statements
but
the
cut
of
his
clothes
the
eloquence
of
his
language
and
the
flowing
length
of
his
whiskers
were
so
far
superior
to
anything
uncle
wellington
had
ever
met
among
the
colored
people
of
his
native
state
that
he
felt
irresistibly
impelled
to
the
conviction
that
nothing
less
than
the
advantages
claimed
for
the
north
by
the
visiting
brother
could
have
produced
such
an
exquisite
flower
of
civilization
any
lingering
doubts
uncle
wellington
may
have
felt
were
entirely
dispelled
by
the
courtly
bow
and
cordial
grasp
of
the
hand
with
which
the
visiting
brother
acknowledged
the
congratulations
showered
upon
him
by
the
audience
at
the
close
of
his
address
the
more
uncle
wellington
mind
dwelt
upon
the
professor
speech
the
more
attractive
seemed
the
picture
of
northern
life
presented
uncle
wellington
possessed
in
large
measure
the
imaginative
faculty
so
freely
bestowed
by
nature
upon
the
race
from
which
the
darker
half
of
his
blood
was
drawn
he
had
indulged
in
occasional
of
an
ideal
state
of
social
equality
but
his
wildest
flights
of
fancy
had
never
located
it
nearer
than
heaven
and
he
had
felt
some
misgivings
about
its
practical
working
even
there
its
desirability
he
had
never
doubted
and
the
speech
of
the
evening
before
had
given
a
local
habitation
and
a
name
to
the
forms
his
imagination
had
bodied
forth
giving
full
rein
to
his
fancy
he
saw
in
the
north
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
a
land
peopled
by
noble
men
and
beautiful
women
among
whom
colored
men
and
women
moved
with
the
ease
and
grace
of
acknowledged
right
then
he
placed
himself
in
the
foreground
of
the
picture
what
a
fine
figure
he
would
have
made
in
the
world
if
he
had
been
born
at
the
free
north
he
imagined
himself
dressed
like
the
professor
and
passing
the
in
a
white
church
and
most
pleasant
of
his
dreams
and
the
hardest
to
realize
as
possible
was
that
of
the
gracious
white
lady
he
might
have
called
wife
uncle
wellington
was
a
mulatto
and
his
features
were
those
of
his
white
father
though
tinged
with
the
hue
of
his
mother
race
and
as
he
lifted
the
kerosene
lamp
at
evening
and
took
a
long
look
at
his
image
in
the
little
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
he
said
to
himself
that
he
was
a
very
man
and
could
have
adorned
a
much
higher
sphere
in
life
than
that
in
which
the
accident
of
birth
had
placed
him
he
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
that
he
lived
in
a
brick
house
with
a
spacious
flower
garden
in
front
the
whole
inclosed
by
a
high
iron
fence
that
he
kept
a
carriage
and
servants
and
never
did
a
stroke
of
work
this
was
the
highest
style
of
living
in
patesville
and
he
could
conceive
of
nothing
finer
uncle
wellington
slept
later
than
usual
the
next
morning
and
the
sunlight
was
pouring
in
at
the
open
window
of
the
bedroom
when
his
dreams
were
interrupted
by
the
voice
of
his
wife
in
tones
meant
to
be
harsh
but
which
no
ordinary
degree
of
passion
could
rob
of
their
native
unctuousness
git

uncle
wellington
rolled
over
yawned
cavernously
stretched
himself
and
with
a
muttered
protest
got
out
of
bed
and
put
on
his
clothes
aunt
milly
had
prepared
a
smoking
breakfast
of
hominy
and
fried
bacon
the
odor
of
which
was
very
grateful
to
his
nostrils
is
breakfus
done

he
inquired
tentatively
as
he
came
into
the
kitchen
and
glanced
at
the
table

aunt
milly
severely
as
she
poured
two
teacups
of
boiling
water
on
two
tablespoonfuls
of
ground
coffee
uncle
wellington
went
down
to
the
spring
and
got
a
pail
of
water
after
which
he
brought
in
some
oak
logs
for
the
fire
place
and
some
lightwood
for
kindling
then
he
drew
a
chair
towards
the
table

started
to

he
nevertheless
performed
his
ablutions
in
a
perfunctory
way
and
resumed
his
seat
at

asked

she
rejoined
with
a
shake
of
her
head
an
you
would
n
lack
ter
go
up
dere
an
all
dese
privileges
asked
uncle
wellington
with
some
degree
of
earnestness
the
old
woman
laughed
until
her
sides
shook
who
gwine
ter
take
me
up
dere
she
inquired
you
got
de
money
i
ain
got
no
money
fer
ter
she
replied
shortly
becoming
serious
at
once
and
with
that
the
subject
was
dropped
uncle
wellington
pulled
a
hoe
from
under
the
house
and
took
his
way
wearily
to
the
potato
patch
he
did
not
feel
like
working
but
aunt
milly
was
the
undisputed
head
of
the
establishment
and
he
did
not
dare
to
openly
neglect
his
work
in
fact
he
regarded
work
at
any
time
as
a
disagreeable
necessity
to
be
avoided
as
much
as
possible
his
wife
was
cast
in
a
different
mould
externally
she
would
have
impressed
the
casual
observer
as
a
neat
and
black
woman
of
middle
age
every
curve
of
whose
ample
figure
and
her
figure
was
all
curves
was
suggestive
of
repose
so
far
from
being
indolent
or
even
deliberate
in
her
movements
she
was
the
most
active
and
energetic
woman
in
the
town
she
went
through
the
physical
exercises
of
a
with
astonishing
vigor
it
was
exhilarating
to
see
her
wash
a
shirt
and
a
study
to
watch
her
do
it
up
a
quick
jerk
shook
out
the
dampened
garment
one
pass
of
her
ample
palm
spread
it
over
the
and
a
few
strokes
with
the
iron
accomplished
what
would
have
occupied
the
ordinary
laundress
for
half
an
hour
to
this
uncommon
and
in
uncle
wellington
opinion
unnecessary
and
unnatural
activity
his
own
habits
were
a
steady
protest
if
aunt
milly
had
been
willing
to
support
him
in
idleness
he
would
have
acquiesced
without
a
murmur
in
her
habits
of
industry
this
she
would
not
do
and
moreover
insisted
on
his
working
at
least
half
the
time
if
she
had
invested
the
proceeds
of
her
labor
in
rich
food
and
fine
clothing
he
might
have
endured
it
better
but
to
her
passion
for
work
was
added
a
most
detestable
thrift
she
absolutely
refused
to
pay
for
clothes
and
required
him
to
furnish
a
certain
proportion
of
the
family
supplies
her
savings
were
carefully
put
by
and
with
them
she
had
bought
and
paid
for
the
modest
cottage
which
she
and
her
husband
occupied
under
her
careful
hand
it
was
always
neat
and
clean
in
summer
the
little
yard
was
gay
with
flowers
and
woe
to
the
heedless
pickaninny
who
should
stray
into
her
yard
and
pluck
a
rose
or
a
verbena
in
a
stout
oaken
chest
under
her
bed
she
kept
a
capacious
stocking
into
which
flowed
a
steady
stream
of
fractional
currency
she
carried
the
key
to
this
chest
in
her
pocket
a
proceeding
regarded
by
uncle
wellington
with
no
little
disfavor
he
was
of
the
opinion
an
opinion
he
would
not
have
dared
to
assert
in
her
presence
that
his
wife
earnings
were
his
own
property
and
he
looked
upon
this
stocking
as
a
drunkard
wife
might
regard
the
saloon
which
absorbed
her
husband
wages
uncle
wellington
hurried
over
the
potato
patch
on
the
morning
of
the
conversation
above
recorded
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
aunt
milly
go
away
with
a
basket
of
clothes
on
her
head
returned
to
the
house
put
on
his
coat
and
went
uptown
he
directed
his
steps
to
a
small
frame
building
fronting
on
the
main
street
of
the
village
at
a
point
where
the
street
was
intersected
by
one
of
the
several
creeks
meandering
through
the
town
cooling
the
air
providing
numerous
for
the
amphibious
small
boy
and
furnishing
for
and
the
rear
of
the
building
rested
on
long
brick
pillars
built
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
steep
bank
of
the
creek
while
the
front
was
level
with
the
street
this
was
the
office
of
matthew
wright
the
sole
representative
of
the
colored
race
at
the
bar
of
chinquapin
county
wright
came
of
an
old
issue
free
colored
family
in
which
though
the
negro
blood
was
present
in
an
attenuated
strain
a
line
of
free
ancestry
could
be
traced
beyond
the
revolutionary
war
he
had
enjoyed
exceptional
opportunities
and
enjoyed
the
distinction
of
being
the
first
and
for
a
long
time
the
only
colored
lawyer
in
north
carolina
his
services
were
frequently
called
into
requisition
by
impecunious
people
of
his
own
race
when
they
had
money
they
went
to
white
lawyers
who
they
shrewdly
conjectured
would
have
more
influence
with
judge
or
jury
than
a
colored
lawyer
however
able
uncle
wellington
found
wright
in
his
office
having
inquired
after
the
health
of
the
lawyer
family
and
all
his
relations
in
detail
uncle
wellington
asked
for
a
professional
opinion
mistah
wright
ef
a
man
wife
got
money
whose
money
is
dat
befo
de
law
er
the
lawyer
put
on
his
professional
air
and
replied
under
the
common
law
which
in
default
of
special
legislative
enactment
is
the
law
of
north
carolina
the
personal
property
of
the
wife
belongs
to
her
husband
but
dat
don
jes
tech
de
suh
i
wuz
axin
money
you
see
uncle
wellington
your
education
has
not
rendered
you
familiar
with
legal
phraseology
the
term
property
or
embraces
according
to
blackstone
all
property
other
than
land
and
therefore
includes
money
any
money
a
man
wife
has
is
his
constructively
and
will
be
recognized
as
his
actually
as
soon
as
he
can
secure
possession
of
it
dat
is
ter
say
suh
my
eddication
don
quite
me
ter
dat
dat
is
ter
say
that
is
to
say
it
yours
when
you
get
it
it
is
yours
so
that
the
law
will
help
you
get
it
but
on
the
other
hand
when
you
once
lay
your
hands
on
it
it
is
yours
so
that
the
law
wo
take
it
away
from
you
uncle
wellington
nodded
to
express
his
full
comprehension
of
the
law
as
expounded
by
wright
but
scratched
his
head
in
a
way
that
expressed
some
disappointment
the
law
seemed
to
wobble
instead
of
enabling
him
to
stand
up
fearlessly
and
demand
his
own
it
threw
him
back
upon
his
own
efforts
and
the
prospect
of
his
being
able
to
overpower
or
outwit
aunt
milly
by
any
ordinary
means
was
very
poor
he
did
not
leave
the
office
but
hung
around
awhile
as
though
there
were
something
further
he
wished
to
speak
about
finally
after
some
discursive
remarks
about
the
crops
and
politics
he
asked
in
an
offhand
disinterested
manner
as
though
the
thought
had
just
occurred
to
him
mistah
wright
we
talkin
law
matters
what
do
it
cos
ter
git
a
defoce
that
depends
upon
circumstances
it
is
altogether
a
matter
of
expense
have
you
and
aunt
milly
been
having
trouble
oh
no
suh
i
was
jes
you
see
continued
the
lawyer
who
was
fond
of
talking
and
had
nothing
else
to
do
for
the
moment
a
divorce
is
not
an
easy
thing
to
get
in
this
state
under
any
circumstances
it
used
to
be
the
law
that
divorce
could
be
granted
only
by
special
act
of
the
legislature
and
it
is
but
recently
that
the
subject
has
been
relegated
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
uncle
wellington
understood
a
part
of
this
but
the
answer
had
not
been
exactly
to
the
point
in
his
mind
den
jes
fer
de
argyment
me
an
my
ole
sh
fall
out
en
wanter
separate
how
could
i
git
a
defoce
that
would
depend
on
what
you
quarreled
about
it
pretty
hard
work
to
answer
general
questions
in
a
particular
way
if
you
merely
wished
to
separate
it
would
be
necessary
to
get
a
divorce
but
if
you
should
want
to
marry
again
you
would
have
to
be
divorced
or
else
you
would
be
guilty
of
bigamy
and
could
be
sent
to
the
penitentiary
but
by
the
way
uncle
wellington
when
were
you
married
i
got
married
de
wah
when
i
was
livin
down
on
rockfish
creek
when
you
were
in
slavery
yas
suh
did
you
have
your
marriage
registered
after
the
surrender
no
suh
never
knowed
nuffin
dat
after
the
war
in
north
carolina
and
other
states
the
freed
people
who
had
sustained
to
each
other
the
relation
of
husband
and
wife
as
it
existed
among
slaves
were
required
by
law
to
register
their
consent
to
continue
in
the
marriage
relation
by
this
simple
expedient
their
former
marriages
of
convenience
received
the
sanction
of
law
and
their
children
the
seal
of
legitimacy
in
many
cases
however
where
the
parties
lived
in
districts
remote
from
the
larger
towns
the
ceremony
was
neglected
or
never
heard
of
by
the
freedmen
well
said
the
lawyer
if
that
is
the
case
and
you
and
aunt
milly
should
disagree
it
would
be
necessary
for
you
to
get
a
divorce
even
if
you
should
want
to
marry
again
you
were
never
legally
married
so
milly
ai
my
lawful
wife
den
she
may
be
your
wife
in
one
sense
of
the
word
but
not
in
such
a
sense
as
to
render
you
liable
to
punishment
for
bigamy
if
you
should
marry
another
woman
but
i
hope
you
will
never
want
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
for
you
have
a
very
good
wife
now
uncle
wellington
went
away
thoughtfully
but
with
a
feeling
of
unaccustomed
lightness
and
freedom
he
had
not
felt
so
free
since
the
memorable
day
when
he
had
first
heard
of
the
emancipation
proclamation
on
leaving
the
lawyer
office
he
called
at
the
workshop
of
one
of
his
friends
peter
williams
a
shoemaker
by
trade
who
had
a
brother
living
in
ohio
is
you
hearn
f
sam
lately
uncle
wellington
inquired
after
the
conversation
had
drifted
through
the
usual
generalities
his
mammy
got
er
letter
f
las
week
he
livin
in
de
town
er
groveland
now
how
he
gittin
on
he
says
he
gittin
on
well
he
ez
how
he
make
five
dollars
a
day
an
have
all
he
kin
do
the
shoemaker
related
various
details
of
his
brother
prosperity
and
uncle
wellington
returned
home
in
a
very
thoughtful
mood
revolving
in
his
mind
a
plan
of
future
action
this
plan
had
been
vaguely
assuming
form
ever
since
the
professor
lecture
and
the
events
of
the
morning
had
brought
out
the
detail
in
bold
relief
two
days
after
the
conversation
with
the
shoemaker
aunt
milly
went
in
the
afternoon
to
visit
a
sister
of
hers
who
lived
several
miles
out
in
the
country
during
her
absence
which
lasted
until
nightfall
uncle
wellington
went
uptown
and
purchased
a
cheap
oilcloth
valise
from
a
shrewd
son
of
israel
who
had
penetrated
to
this
locality
with
a
stock
of
notions
and
cheap
clothing
uncle
wellington
had
his
purchase
done
up
in
brown
paper
and
took
the
parcel
under
his
arm
arrived
at
home
he
unwrapped
the
valise
and
thrust
into
its
capacious
jaws
his
best
suit
of
clothes
some
underwear
and
a
few
other
small
articles
for
personal
use
and
adornment
then
he
carried
the
valise
out
into
the
yard
and
first
looking
cautiously
around
to
see
if
there
was
any
one
in
sight
concealed
it
in
a
clump
of
bushes
in
a
corner
of
the
yard
it
may
be
inferred
from
this
proceeding
that
uncle
wellington
was
preparing
for
a
step
of
some
consequence
in
fact
he
had
fully
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
the
north
but
he
still
lacked
the
most
important
requisite
for
traveling
with
comfort
namely
the
money
to
pay
his
expenses
the
idea
of
tramping
the
distance
which
separated
him
from
the
promised
land
of
liberty
and
equality
had
never
occurred
to
him
when
a
slave
he
had
several
times
been
importuned
by
fellow
servants
to
join
them
in
the
attempt
to
escape
from
bondage
but
he
had
never
wanted
his
freedom
badly
enough
to
walk
a
thousand
miles
for
it
if
he
could
have
gone
to
canada
by
or
by
rail
or
on
horseback
with
stops
for
regular
meals
he
would
probably
have
undertaken
the
trip
the
funds
he
now
needed
for
his
journey
were
in
aunt
milly
chest
he
had
thought
a
great
deal
about
his
right
to
this
money
it
was
his
wife
savings
and
he
had
never
dared
to
dispute
openly
her
right
to
exercise
exclusive
control
over
what
she
earned
but
the
lawyer
had
assured
him
of
his
right
to
the
money
of
which
he
was
already
constructively
in
possession
and
he
had
therefore
determined
to
possess
himself
actually
of
the
coveted
stocking
it
was
impracticable
for
him
to
get
the
key
of
the
chest
aunt
milly
kept
it
in
her
pocket
by
day
and
under
her
pillow
at
night
she
was
a
light
sleeper
and
if
not
awakened
by
the
abstraction
of
the
key
would
certainly
have
been
disturbed
by
the
unlocking
of
the
chest
but
one
alternative
remained
and
that
was
to
break
open
the
chest
in
her
absence
there
was
a
revival
in
progress
at
the
colored
methodist
church
aunt
milly
was
as
energetic
in
her
religion
as
in
other
respects
and
had
not
missed
a
single
one
of
the
meetings
she
returned
at
nightfall
from
her
visit
to
the
country
and
prepared
a
frugal
supper
uncle
wellington
did
not
eat
as
heartily
as
usual
aunt
milly
perceived
his
want
of
appetite
and
spoke
of
it
he
explained
it
by
saying
that
he
did
not
feel
very
well
is
you
gwine
ter
inquired
his
wife
i
reckon
i
stay
home
an
go
ter
bed
he
replied
i
ai
feelin
well
dis
evenin
an
i
i
better
git
a
good
res
well
you
kin
stay
ef
you
mineter

preachin
make
you
feel
better
but
ef
you

gwine
don
fergit
ter

in
some
wood
lighterd
you
go
ter
bed
de
moon

shinin
bright
an
you
have
no
not
bein
able
ter
see
uncle
wellington
followed
her
out
to
the
gate
and
watched
her
receding
form
until
it
disappeared
in
the
distance
then
he
the
house
with
a
quick
step
and
taking
a
hatchet
from
a
corner
of
the
room
drew
the
chest
from
under
the
bed
as
he
applied
the
hatchet
to
the
fastenings
a
thought
struck
him
and
by
the
flickering
light
of
the
blazing
on
the
hearth
a
look
of
hesitation
might
have
been
seen
to
take
the
place
of
the
determined
expression
his
face
had
worn
up
to
that
time
he
had
argued
himself
into
the
belief
that
his
present
action
was
lawful
and
justifiable
though
this
conviction
had
not
prevented
him
from
trembling
in
every
limb
as
though
he
were
committing
a
mere
vulgar
theft
it
had
still
nerved
him
to
the
deed
now
even
his
moral
courage
began
to
weaken
the
lawyer
had
told
him
that
his
property
was
his
own
in
taking
it
he
was
therefore
only
exercising
his
lawful
right
but
at
the
point
of
breaking
open
the
chest
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
taking
this
money
in
order
to
get
away
from
aunt
milly
and
that
he
justified
his
desertion
of
her
by
the
opinion
that
she
was
not
his
lawful
wife
if
she
was
not
his
wife
then
he
had
no
right
to
take
the
money
if
she
was
his
wife
he
had
no
right
to
desert
her
and
would
certainly
have
no
right
to
marry
another
woman
his
scheme
was
about
to
go
to
shipwreck
on
this
rock
when
another
idea
occurred
to
him
de
lawyer
say
dat
in
one
sense
er
de
word
de
ole
is
my
wife
in
anudder
sense
er
de
word
she
ai
my
wife
ef
i
goes
ter
de
norf
marry
a
i
ai
commit
no
brigamy
in
dat
sense
er
de
word
she
ai
my
wife
but
ef
i
takes
dis
money
i
ai
stealin
it
in
dat
sense
er
de
word
she
is
my
wife
dat
all
de
trouble
away
having
reached
this
ingenious
conclusion
uncle
wellington
applied
the
hatchet
vigorously
soon
loosened
the
fastenings
of
the
chest
and
with
trembling
hands
extracted
from
its
depths
a
capacious
blue
cotton
stocking
he
emptied
the
stocking
on
the
table
his
first
impulse
was
to
take
the
whole
but
again
there
arose
in
his
mind
a
doubt
a
very
obtrusive
unreasonable
doubt
but
a
doubt
nevertheless
of
the
absolute
rectitude
of
his
conduct
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
he
hurriedly
counted
the
money
it
was
in
bills
of
small
denominations
and
found
it
to
be
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
he
then
divided
it
into
two
piles
of
one
hundred
and
dollars
each
he
put
one
pile
into
his
pocket
returned
the
remainder
to
the
stocking
and
replaced
it
where
he
had
found
it
he
then
closed
the
chest
and
shoved
it
under
the
bed
after
having
arranged
the
fire
so
that
it
could
safely
be
left
burning
he
took
a
last
look
around
the
room
and
went
out
into
the
moonlight
locking
the
door
behind
him
and
hanging
the
key
on
a
nail
in
the
wall
where
his
wife
would
be
likely
to
look
for
it
he
then
secured
his
valise
from
behind
the
bushes
and
left
the
yard
as
he
passed
by
the
he
said
to
himself
well
i
declar
ef
i
ai
done
fergot
ter
tote
in
dat
lighterd
i
reckon
de
ole
ha
ter
fetch
it
in
dis
time
he
hastened
through
the
quiet
streets
avoiding
the
few
people
who
were
abroad
at
that
hour
and
soon
reached
the
railroad
station
from
which
a
train
left
at
nine
he
went
around
to
the
dark
side
of
the
train
and
climbed
into
a
car
where
he
shrank
into
the
darkest
corner
and
turned
his
face
away
from
the
dim
light
of
the
single
dirty
lamp
there
were
no
passengers
in
the
car
except
one
or
two
sleepy
negroes
who
had
got
on
at
some
other
station
and
a
white
man
who
had
gone
into
the
car
to
smoke
accompanied
by
a
gigantic
bloodhound
finally
the
train
crept
out
of
the
station
from
the
window
uncle
wellington
looked
out
upon
the
familiar
cabins
and
turpentine
stills
the
new
barrel
factory
the
brickyard
where
he
had
once
worked
for
some
time
and
as
the
train
rattled
through
the
outskirts
of
the
town
he
saw
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
the
white
headstones
of
the
colored
cemetery
where
his
only
daughter
had
been
buried
several
years
before
presently
the
conductor
came
around
uncle
wellington
had
not
bought
a
ticket
and
the
conductor
collected
a
cash
fare
he
was
not
acquainted
with
uncle
wellington
but
had
just
had
a
drink
at
the
saloon
near
the
depot
and
felt
at
peace
with
all
mankind
where
are
you
going
uncle
he
inquired
carelessly
uncle
wellington
face
assumed
the
ashen
hue
which
does
duty
for
pallor
in
dusky
countenances
and
his
knees
began
to
tremble
controlling
his
voice
as
well
as
he
could
he
replied
that
he
was
going
up
to
jonesboro
the
terminus
of
the
railroad
to
work
for
a
gentleman
at
that
place
he
felt
immensely
relieved
when
the
conductor
pocketed
the
fare
picked
up
his
lantern
and
moved
away
it
was
very
unphilosophical
and
very
absurd
that
a
man
who
was
only
doing
right
should
feel
like
a
thief
shrink
from
the
sight
of
other
people
and
lie
instinctively
fine
distinctions
were
not
in
uncle
wellington
line
but
he
was
struck
by
the
unreasonableness
of
his
feelings
and
still
more
by
the
discomfort
they
caused
him
by
and
by
however
the
motion
of
the
train
made
him
drowsy
his
thoughts
all
ran
together
in
confusion
and
he
fell
asleep
with
his
head
on
his
valise
and
one
hand
in
his
pocket
clasped
tightly
around
the
roll
of
money
ii
the
train
from
pittsburg
drew
into
the
union
depot
at
groveland
ohio
one
morning
in
the
spring
of
with
bell
ringing
and
engine
puffing
and
from
a
emerged
the
form
of
uncle
wellington
braboy
a
little
dusty
and
and
with
a
sleepy
look
about
his
eyes
he
mingled
in
the
crowd
and
valise
in
hand
moved
toward
the
main
exit
from
the
depot
there
were
several
tracks
to
be
crossed
and
more
than
once
a
watchman
snatched
him
out
of
the
way
of
a
or
a
train
backing
into
the
depot
he
at
length
reached
the
door
beyond
which
and
as
near
as
the
regulations
would
permit
stood
a
number
of
hackmen
vociferously
soliciting
patronage
one
of
them
a
colored
man
soon
secured
several
passengers
as
he
closed
the
door
after
the
last
one
he
turned
to
uncle
wellington
who
stood
near
him
on
the
sidewalk
looking
about
irresolutely
is
you
goin
uptown
asked
the
hackman
as
he
prepared
to
mount
the
box

uncle
wellington
accepted
the
offer
and
mounted
the
box
the
hackman
whipped
up
his
horses
the
carriage
climbed
the
steep
hill
leading
up
to
the
town
and
the
passengers
inside
were
soon
deposited
at
their
hotels
whereabouts
do
you
want
to
go
asked
the
hackman
of
uncle
wellington
when
the
carriage
was
emptied
of
its
last
passengers

said
wellington
what

uncle
wellington
did
not
know
the
street
and
number
and
the
hackman
had
to
explain
to
him
the
mystery
of
numbered
houses
to
which
he
was
a
total
stranger
where
is

from
asked
the
hackman

what

they
followed
one
of
the
least
handsome
streets
of
the
city
for
more
than
a
mile
turned
into
a
cross
street
and
drew
up
before
a
small
frame
house
from
the
front
of
which
a
sign
painted
in
white
upon
a
black
background
announced
to
the
reading
public
in
letters
inclined
to
each
other
at
various
angles
that
whitewashing
and
kalsomining
were
dun
there
a
knock
at
the
door
brought
out
a
slatternly
looking
colored
woman
she
had
evidently
been
disturbed
at
her
toilet
for
she
held
a
comb
in
one
hand
and
the
hair
on
one
side
of
her
head
stood
out
loosely
while
on
the
other
side
it
was
braided
close
to
her
head
she
called
her
husband
who
proved
to
be
the
patesville
shoemaker
brother
the
hackman
introduced
the
traveler
whose
name
he
had
learned
on
the
way
out
collected
his
quarter
and
drove
away
johnson
the
shoemaker
brother
welcomed
uncle
wellington
to
groveland
and
listened
with
eager
delight
to
the
news
of
the
old
town
from
which
he
himself
had
run
away
many
years
before
and
followed
the
north
star
to
groveland
he
had
changed
his
name
from
williams
to
johnson
on
account
of
the
fugitive
slave
law
which
at
the
time
of
his
escape
from
bondage
had
rendered
it
advisable
for
runaway
slaves
to
court
obscurity
after
the
war
he
had
retained
the
adopted
name
johnson
prepared
breakfast
for
her
guest
who
ate
it
with
an
appetite
sharpened
by
his
journey
after
breakfast
he
went
to
bed
and
slept
until
late
in
the
afternoon
after
supper
johnson
took
uncle
wellington
to
visit
some
of
the
neighbors
who
had
come
from
north
carolina
before
the
war
they
all
expressed
much
pleasure
at
meeting
braboy
a
title
which
at
first
sounded
a
little
odd
to
uncle
wellington
at
home
he
had
been
brer
or
uncle
it
was
a
novel
experience
to
be
called
mister
and
he
set
it
down
with
secret
satisfaction
as
one
of
the
first
fruits
of
northern
liberty
would
you
lack
ter
look
de
town
a
little
asked
johnson
at
breakfast
next
morning
i
ain
got
no
job
dis
mawnin
an
i
kin
show
you
some
er
de
sights
uncle
wellington
acquiesced
in
this
arrangement
and
they
walked
up
to
the
corner
to
the
line
in
a
few
moments
a
car
passed
johnson
jumped
on
the
moving
car
and
uncle
wellington
followed
his
example
at
the
risk
of
life
or
limb
as
it
was
his
first
experience
of
street
cars
there
was
only
one
vacant
seat
in
the
car
and
that
was
between
two
white
women
in
the
forward
end
johnson
motioned
to
the
seat
but
wellington
shrank
from
walking
between
those
two
rows
of
white
people
to
say
nothing
of
sitting
between
the
two
women
so
he
remained
standing
in
the
rear
part
of
the
car
a
moment
later
as
the
car
rounded
a
short
curve
he
was
pitched
sidewise
into
the
lap
of
a
stout
woman
magnificently
attired
in
a
ruffled
blue
calico
gown
the
lady
colored
up
and
uncle
wellington
as
he
struggled
to
his
feet
amid
the
laughter
of
the
passengers
was
absolutely
helpless
with
embarrassment
until
the
conductor
came
up
behind
him
and
pushed
him
toward
the
vacant
place
sit
down
will
you
he
said
and
before
uncle
wellington
could
collect
himself
he
was
seated
between
the
two
white
women
everybody
in
the
car
seemed
to
be
looking
at
him
but
he
came
to
the
conclusion
after
he
had
pulled
himself
together
and
reflected
a
few
moments
that
he
would
find
this
method
of
locomotion
pleasanter
when
he
got
used
to
it
and
then
he
could
score
one
more
glorious
privilege
gained
by
his
change
of
residence
they
got
off
at
the
public
square
in
the
heart
of
the
city
where
there
were
flowers
and
statues
and
fountains
playing
johnson
pointed
out
the
the
the
jail
and
other
public
buildings
fronting
on
the
square
they
visited
the
market
near
by
and
from
an
elevated
point
looked
down
upon
the
extensive
lumber
yards
and
factories
that
were
the
chief
sources
of
the
city
prosperity
beyond
these
they
could
see
the
fleet
of
ships
that
lined
the
coal
and
iron
ore
docks
of
the
harbor
johnson
who
was
quite
a
fluent
talker
enlarged
upon
the
wealth
and
prosperity
of
the
city
and
wellington
who
had
never
before
been
in
a
town
of
more
than
three
thousand
inhabitants
manifested
sufficient
interest
and
wonder
to
satisfy
the
most
exacting
they
called
at
the
office
of
a
colored
lawyer
and
member
of
the
legislature
formerly
from
north
carolina
who
scenting
a
new
constituent
and
a
possible
client
greeted
the
stranger
warmly
and
in
flowing
speech
pointed
out
the
superior
advantages
of
life
at
the
north
citing
himself
as
an
illustration
of
the
possibilities
of
life
in
a
country
really
free
as
they
wended
their
way
homeward
to
dinner
uncle
wellington
with
quickened
pulse
and
rising
hopes
felt
that
this
was
indeed
the
promised
land
and
that
it
must
be
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
uncle
wellington
remained
at
the
residence
of
johnson
for
several
weeks
before
making
any
effort
to
find
employment
he
spent
this
period
in
looking
about
the
city
the
most
commonplace
things
possessed
for
him
the
charm
of
novelty
and
he
had
come
prepared
to
admire
shortly
after
his
arrival
he
had
offered
to
pay
for
his
board
intimating
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
plenty
of
money
johnson
declined
to
accept
anything
from
him
for
board
and
expressed
himself
as
being
only
too
proud
to
have
braboy
remain
in
the
house
on
the
footing
of
an
honored
guest
until
he
had
settled
himself
he
lightened
in
some
degree
however
the
burden
of
obligation
under
which
a
prolonged
stay
on
these
terms
would
have
placed
his
guest
by
soliciting
from
the
latter
occasional
small
loans
until
uncle
wellington
roll
of
money
began
to
lose
its
plumpness
and
with
an
empty
pocket
staring
him
in
the
face
he
felt
the
necessity
of
finding
something
to
do
during
his
residence
in
the
city
he
had
met
several
times
his
first
acquaintance
peterson
the
hackman
who
from
time
to
time
inquired
how
he
was
getting
along
on
one
of
these
occasions
wellington
mentioned
his
willingness
to
accept
employment
as
good
luck
would
have
it
peterson
knew
of
a
vacant
situation
he
had
formerly
been
coachman
for
a
wealthy
gentleman
residing
on
oakwood
avenue
but
had
resigned
the
situation
to
go
into
business
for
himself
his
place
had
been
filled
by
an
irishman
who
had
just
been
discharged
for
drunkenness
and
the
gentleman
that
very
day
had
sent
word
to
peterson
asking
him
if
he
could
recommend
a
competent
and
trustworthy
coachman
does

an
folks

much
fer
nuthin
next
morning
wellington
blacked
his
shoes
carefully
put
on
a
clean
collar
and
with
the
aid
of
johnson
tied
his
cravat
in
a
jaunty
bow
which
gave
him
quite
a
sprightly
air
and
a
much
younger
look
than
his
years
warranted
peterson
called
for
him
at
eight
after
traversing
several
cross
streets
they
turned
into
oakwood
avenue
and
walked
along
the
finest
part
of
it
for
about
half
a
mile
the
handsome
houses
of
this
famous
avenue
the
stately
trees
the
lawns
dotted
with
flower
beds
fountains
and
statuary
made
up
a
picture
so
far
surpassing
anything
in
wellington
experience
as
to
fill
him
with
an
almost
oppressive
sense
of
its
beauty
hit
looks
lack
hebben
he
said
softly
it
a
pootty
fine
street
rejoined
his
companion
with
a
judicial
air
but
i
do
like
dem
big
lawns
it
too
much
trouble
ter
keep
de
grass
down
one
er
dem
lawns
is
big
enough
to
pasture
a
couple
er
cows
they
went
down
a
street
running
at
right
angles
to
the
avenue
and
turned
into
the
rear
of
the
corner
lot
a
large
building
of
pressed
brick
trimmed
with
stone
loomed
up
before
them
do

gemman
lib

dis
house
asked
wellington
gazing
with
awe
at
the
front
of
the
building
no

de
barn
said
peterson
with
contempt
and
leading
the
way
past
a
clump
of
shrubbery
to
the
he
went
up
the
back
steps
and
rang
the
the
ring
was
answered
by
a
buxom
irishwoman
of
a
natural
freshness
of
complexion
deepened
to
a
fiery
red
by
the
heat
of
a
kitchen
range
wellington
thought
he
had
seen
her
before
but
his
mind
had
received
so
many
new
impressions
lately
that
it
was
a
minute
or
two
before
he
recognized
in
her
the
lady
whose
lap
he
had
involuntarily
occupied
for
a
moment
on
his
first
day
in
groveland
faith
she
exclaimed
as
she
admitted
them

flow
of
eloquence
was
interrupted
at
this
point
by
the
appearance
of
todd
himself
who
had
been
informed
of
the
arrival
he
asked
some
questions
in
regard
to
qualifications
and
former
experience
and
in
view
of
his
recent
arrival
in
the
city
was
willing
to
accept
peterson
recommendation
instead
of
a
reference
he
said
a
few
words
about
the
nature
of
the
work
and
stated
his
willingness
to
pay
wellington
the
wages
formerly
allowed
peterson
thirty
dollars
a
month
and
board
and
lodging
this
handsome
offer
was
eagerly
accepted
and
it
was
agreed
that
wellington
term
of
service
should
begin
immediately
peterson
being
familiar
with
the
work
and
financially
interested
conducted
the
new
coachman
through
the
stables
and
showed
him
what
he
would
have
to
do
the
harness
the
variety
of
carriages
the
names
of
which
he
learned
for
the
first
time
the
arrangements
for
feeding
and
watering
the
horses
these
appointments
of
a
rich
man
stable
impressed
wellington
very
much
and
he
wondered
that
so
much
luxury
should
be
wasted
on
mere
horses
the
room
assigned
to
him
in
the
second
story
of
the
barn
was
a
finer
apartment
than
he
had
ever
slept
in
and
the
salary
attached
to
the
situation
was
greater
than
the
combined
monthly
earnings
of
himself
and
aunt
milly
in
their
southern
home
surely
he
thought
his
lines
had
fallen
in
pleasant
places
under
the
stimulus
of
new
surroundings
wellington
applied
himself
diligently
to
work
and
with
the
occasional
advice
of
peterson
soon
mastered
the
details
of
his
employment
he
found
the
female
servants
with
whom
he
took
his
meals
very
amiable
ladies
the
cook
katie
flannigan
was
a
widow
her
husband
a
sailor
had
been
lost
at
sea
she
was
a
woman
of
many
words
and
when
she
was
not
lamenting
the
late
flannigan
loss
according
to
her
story
he
had
been
a
model
of
all
the
virtues
she
would
turn
the
batteries
of
her
tongue
against
the
former
coachman
this
gentleman
as
wellington
gathered
from
frequent
remarks
dropped
by
flannigan
had
paid
her
attentions
clearly
susceptible
of
a
serious
construction
these
attentions
had
not
borne
their
legitimate
fruit
and
she
was
still
a
widow
unconsoled
hence
flannigan
tears
the
housemaid
was
a
plump
german
girl
with
a
pronounced
german
accent
the
presence
on
washdays
of
a
bohemian
laundress
of
recent
importation
added
another
to
the
variety
of
ways
in
which
the
english
tongue
was
mutilated
in
todd
kitchen
association
with
the
white
women
drew
out
all
the
native
gallantry
of
the
mulatto
and
wellington
developed
quite
a
helpful
turn
his
politeness
his
willingness
to
lend
a
hand
in
kitchen
or
laundry
and
the
fact
that
he
was
the
only
male
servant
on
the
place
combined
to
make
him
a
prime
favorite
in
the
servants
quarters
it
was
the
general
opinion
among
wellington
acquaintances
that
he
was
a
single
man
he
had
come
to
the
city
alone
had
never
been
heard
to
speak
of
a
wife
and
to
personal
questions
bearing
upon
the
subject
of
matrimony
had
always
returned
evasive
answers
though
he
had
never
questioned
the
correctness
of
the
lawyer
opinion
in
regard
to
his
slave
marriage
his
conscience
had
never
been
entirely
at
ease
since
his
departure
from
the
south
and
any
positive
denial
of
his
married
condition
would
have
stuck
in
his
throat
the
inference
naturally
drawn
from
his
reticence
in
regard
to
the
past
coupled
with
his
expressed
intention
of
settling
permanently
in
groveland
was
that
he
belonged
in
the
ranks
of
the
unmarried
and
was
therefore
legitimate
game
for
any
widow
or
old
maid
who
could
bring
him
down
as
such
game
is
bagged
easiest
at
short
range
he
received
numerous
invitations
to
where
he
feasted
on
unlimited
chicken
and
pound
cake
he
used
to
compare
these
viands
with
the
plain
fare
often
served
by
aunt
milly
and
the
result
of
the
comparison
was
another
item
to
the
credit
of
the
north
upon
his
mental
ledger
several
of
the
colored
ladies
who
smiled
upon
him
were
blessed
with
good
looks
and
uncle
wellington
naturally
of
a
susceptible
temperament
as
people
of
lively
imagination
are
apt
to
be
would
probably
have
fallen
a
victim
to
the
charms
of
some
woman
of
his
own
race
had
it
not
been
for
a
strong
in
the
person
of
flannigan
the
attentions
of
the
lately
discharged
coachman
had
lighted
anew
the
smouldering
fires
of
her
widowed
heart
and
awakened
longings
which
still
remained
unsatisfied
she
was
years
old
and
felt
the
need
of
some
one
else
to
love
she
was
not
a
woman
of
lofty
ideals
with
her
a
man
was
a
man
for
a
that
an
a
that
and
aside
from
the
accident
of
color
uncle
wellington
was
as
personable
a
man
as
any
of
her
acquaintance
some
people
might
have
objected
to
his
complexion
but
then
flannigan
argued
he
was
at
least
half
white
and
this
being
the
case
there
was
no
good
reason
why
he
should
be
regarded
as
black
uncle
wellington
was
not
slow
to
perceive
flannigan
charms
of
person
and
appreciated
to
the
full
the
skill
that
prepared
the
choice
tidbits
reserved
for
his
plate
at
dinner
the
prospect
of
securing
a
white
wife
had
been
one
of
the
principal
inducements
offered
by
a
life
at
the
north
but
the
awe
of
white
people
in
which
he
had
been
reared
was
still
too
strong
to
permit
his
taking
any
active
steps
toward
the
object
of
his
secret
desire
had
not
the
lady
herself
come
to
his
assistance
with
a
little
of
the
native
coquetry
of
her
race
ah
misther
braboy
she
said
one
evening
when
they
sat
at
the
supper
table
alone
it
was
the
second

and
she
had
not

mis
flannigan
said
wellington
but
he
felt
a
sudden
and
substantial
increase
in
courage
when
she
had
spoken
and
it
was
with
astonishing
ease
that
he
found
himself
saying

an
flannigan
affected
much

and
embarrassment
at

bold
declaration
oh

he
said
as
he
moved
his
chair
up
closer
to
hers
one
evening
in
the
following
week
they
went
out
after
supper
to
the
residence
of
rev
cæsar
williams
pastor
of
the
colored
baptist
church
and
after
the
usual
preliminaries
were
pronounced
man
and
wife
iii
according
to
all
his
preconceived
notions
this
marriage
ought
to
have
been
the
acme
of
uncle
wellington
felicity
but
he
soon
found
that
it
was
not
without
its
drawbacks
on
the
following
morning
todd
was
informed
of
the
marriage
he
had
no
special
objection
to
it
or
interest
in
it
except
that
he
was
opposed
on
principle
to
having
husband
and
wife
in
his
employment
at
the
same
time
as
a
consequence
braboy
whose
place
could
be
more
easily
filled
than
that
of
her
husband
received
notice
that
her
services
would
not
be
required
after
the
end
of
the
month
her
husband
was
retained
in
his
place
as
coachman
upon
the
loss
of
her
situation
braboy
decided
to
exercise
the
married
woman
prerogative
of
letting
her
husband
support
her
she
rented
the
upper
floor
of
a
small
house
in
an
irish
neighborhood
the
newly
wedded
pair
furnished
their
rooms
on
the
installment
plan
and
began
housekeeping
there
was
one
little
circumstance
however
that
interfered
slightly
with
their
enjoyment
of
that
perfect
freedom
from
care
which
ought
to
characterize
a
honeymoon
the
people
who
owned
the
house
and
occupied
the
lower
floor
had
rented
the
upper
part
to
braboy
in
person
it
never
occurring
to
them
that
her
husband
could
be
other
than
a
white
man
when
it
became
known
that
he
was
colored
the
landlord
dennis
felt
that
he
had
been
imposed
upon
and
at
the
end
of
the
first
month
served
notice
upon
his
tenants
to
leave
the
premises
when
braboy
with
characteristic
impetuosity
inquired
the
meaning
of
this
proceeding
she
was
informed
by
that
he
did
not
care
to
live
in
the
same
house
wid
naygurs
braboy
resented
the
epithet
with
more
warmth
than
dignity
and
for
a
brief
space
of
time
the
air
was
green
with
choice
specimens
of
brogue
the
altercation
barely
ceasing
before
it
had
reached
the
point
of
blows
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
braboys
could
not
longer
live
comfortably
in
house
and
they
soon
vacated
the
premises
first
letting
the
rent
get
a
couple
of
weeks
in
arrears
as
a
punishment
to
the
too
fastidious
landlord
they
moved
to
a
small
house
on
hackman
street
a
favorite
locality
with
colored
people
for
a
while
affairs
ran
smoothly
in
the
new
home
the
colored
people
seemed
at
first
well
enough
disposed
toward
braboy
and
she
made
quite
a
large
acquaintance
among
them
it
was
difficult
however
for
braboy
to
divest
herself
of
the
consciousness
that
she
was
white
and
therefore
superior
to
her
neighbors
occasional
words
and
acts
by
which
she
manifested
this
feeling
were
noticed
and
resented
by
her
and
sensitive
colored
neighbors
the
result
was
a
slight
coolness
between
them
that
her
few
white
neighbors
did
not
visit
her
she
naturally
and
no
doubt
correctly
imputed
to
disapproval
of
her
matrimonial
relations
under
these
circumstances
braboy
was
left
a
good
deal
to
her
own
company
owing
to
lack
of
opportunity
in
early
life
she
was
not
a
woman
of
many
resources
either
mental
or
moral
it
is
therefore
not
strange
that
in
order
to
relieve
her
loneliness
she
should
occasionally
have
recourse
to
a
glass
of
beer
and
as
the
habit
grew
upon
her
to
still
stronger
stimulants
uncle
wellington
himself
was
no
and
did
not
interpose
any
objection
so
long
as
she
kept
her
potations
within
reasonable
limits
and
was
apparently
none
the
worse
for
them
indeed
he
sometimes
joined
her
in
a
glass
on
one
of
these
occasions
he
drank
a
little
too
much
and
while
driving
the
ladies
of
todd
family
to
the
opera
ran
against
a
and
overturned
the
carriage
to
the
serious
discomposure
of
the
ladies
nerves
and
at
the
cost
of
his
situation
a
coachman
discharged
under
such
circumstances
is
not
in
the
best
position
for
procuring
employment
at
his
calling
and
uncle
wellington
under
the
pressure
of
need
was
obliged
to
seek
some
other
means
of
livelihood
at
the
suggestion
of
his
friend
johnson
he
bought
a
whitewash
brush
a
peck
of
lime
a
couple
of
pails
and
a
and
began
work
as
a
whitewasher
his
first
efforts
were
very
crude
and
for
a
while
he
lost
a
customer
in
every
person
he
worked
for
he
nevertheless
managed
to
pick
up
a
living
during
the
spring
and
summer
months
and
to
support
his
wife
and
himself
in
comparative
comfort
the
approach
of
winter
put
an
end
to
the
whitewashing
season
and
left
uncle
wellington
dependent
for
support
upon
occasional
jobs
of
unskilled
labor
the
income
derived
from
these
was
very
uncertain
and
braboy
was
at
length
driven
by
stress
of
circumstances
to
the
washtub
that
last
refuge
of
honest
poverty
in
all
countries
where
the
use
of
clothing
is
conventional
the
last
state
of
uncle
wellington
was
now
worse
than
the
first
under
the
soft
firmness
of
aunt
milly
rule
he
had
not
been
required
to
do
a
great
deal
of
work
prompt
and
cheerful
obedience
being
chiefly
what
was
expected
of
him
but
matters
were
very
different
here
he
had
not
only
to
bring
in
the
coal
and
water
but
to
rub
the
clothes
and
turn
the
wringer
and
to
humiliate
himself
before
the
public
by
emptying
the
tubs
and
hanging
out
the
wash
in
full
view
of
the
neighbors
and
he
had
to
deliver
the
clothes
when
laundered
at
times
wellington
found
himself
wondering
if
his
second
marriage
had
been
a
wise
one
other
circumstances
combined
to
change
in
some
degree
his
once
conception
of
life
at
the
north
he
had
believed
that
all
men
were
equal
in
this
favored
locality
but
he
discovered
more
degrees
of
inequality
than
he
had
ever
perceived
at
the
south
a
colored
man
might
be
as
good
as
a
white
man
in
theory
but
neither
of
them
was
of
any
special
consequence
without
money
or
talent
or
position
uncle
wellington
found
a
great
many
privileges
open
to
him
at
the
north
but
he
had
not
been
educated
to
the
point
where
he
could
appreciate
them
or
take
advantage
of
them
and
the
enjoyment
of
many
of
them
was
expensive
and
for
that
reason
alone
as
far
beyond
his
reach
as
they
had
ever
been
when
he
once
began
to
admit
even
the
possibility
of
a
mistake
on
his
part
these
considerations
presented
themselves
to
his
mind
with
increasing
force
on
occasions
when
braboy
would
require
of
him
some
unusual
physical
exertion
or
when
too
frequent
applications
to
the
bottle
had
loosened
her
tongue
uncle
mind
would
revert
with
a
remorseful
twinge
of
conscience
to
the
far
of
his
southern
home
a
film
would
come
over
his
eyes
and
brain
and
instead
of
the
irishwoman
opposite
him
he
could
see
the
black
but
comely
disk
of
aunt
milly
countenance
bending
over
the
washtub
the
elegant
brogue
of
braboy
would
deliquesce
into
the
soft
dialect
of
north
carolina
and
he
would
only
be
aroused
from
this
blissful
reverie
by
a
wet
shirt
or
a
handful
of
suds
thrown
into
his
face
with
which
gentle
reminder
his
wife
would
recall
his
attention
to
the
duties
of
the
moment
there
came
a
time
one
day
in
spring
when
there
was
no
longer
any
question
about
it
uncle
wellington
was
desperately
homesick
liberty
equality
privileges
all
were
but
as
dust
in
the
balance
when
weighed
against
his
longing
for
old
scenes
and
faces
it
was
the
natural
reaction
in
the
mind
of
a
man
who
had
tried
to
force
the
current
of
a
sluggish
existence
into
a
new
and
radically
different
channel
an
active
industrious
man
making
the
change
in
early
life
while
there
was
time
to
spare
for
the
waste
of
adaptation
might
have
found
in
the
new
place
more
favorable
conditions
than
in
the
old
in
wellington
age
and
temperament
combined
to
prevent
the
success
of
the
experiment
the
spirit
of
enterprise
and
ambition
into
which
he
had
been
temporarily
galvanized
could
no
longer
prevail
against
the
inertia
of
old
habits
of
life
and
thought
one
day
when
he
had
been
sent
to
deliver
clothes
he
performed
his
errand
quickly
and
boarding
a
passing
street
car
paid
one
of
his
very
few
pieces
to
ride
down
to
the
office
of
the
hon
brown
the
colored
lawyer
whom
he
had
visited
when
he
first
came
to
the
city
and
who
was
well
known
to
him
by
sight
and
reputation
brown
he
said
i
ain
very
well
wid
my
ole
what
the
trouble
asked
the
lawyer
with
curtness
for
he
did
not
scent
much
of
a
fee
well
de
main
trouble
is
she
doan
treat
me
right
an
den
she
gits
drunk
an
dat
she
lays
han
on
me
i
kyars
de
marks
er
dat
on
my
face
now
he
showed
the
lawyer
a
long
scratch
on
the
neck
why
do
you
defend
yourself
you
don
know
mis
braboy
suh
you
don
know
dat
he
replied
with
a
shake
of
the
head
some
er
dese
yer
women
is
strong
in
de
wris
well
braboy
it
what
you
might
have
expected
when
you
turned
your
back
on
your
own
people
and
married
a
white
woman
you
were
content
with
being
a
slave
to
the
white
folks
once
but
you
must
try
it
again
some
people
never
know
when
they
got
enough
i
do
see
that
there
any
help
for
you
unless
he
added
suggestively
you
had
a
good
deal
of
money
pears
ter
me
i
heared
somebody
say
sence
i
up
heah
dat
it
wuz
de
law
fer
folks
an
colored
folks
ter
marry
that
was
once
the
law
though
it
has
always
been
a
dead
letter
in
groveland
in
fact
it
was
the
law
when
you
got
married
and
until
i
introduced
a
bill
in
the
legislature
last
fall
to
repeal
it
but
even
that
law
did
hit
cases
like
yours
it
was
unlawful
to
make
such
a
marriage
but
it
was
a
good
marriage
when
once
made
i
don
jes
git
dat
my
head
said
wellington
scratching
that
member
as
though
to
make
a
hole
for
the
idea
to
enter
it
quite
plain
braboy
it
unlawful
to
kill
a
man
but
when
he
killed
he
just
as
dead
as
though
the
law
permitted
it
i
afraid
you
have
much
of
a
case
but
if
you
go
to
work
and
get
dollars
together
i
see
what
i
can
do
for
you
we
may
be
able
to
pull
a
case
through
on
the
ground
of
extreme
cruelty
i
might
even
start
the
case
if
you
brought
in
ten
dollars
wellington
went
away
sorrowfully
the
laws
of
ohio
were
very
little
more
satisfactory
than
those
of
north
carolina
and
as
for
the
ten
dollars
the
lawyer
might
as
well
have
told
him
to
bring
in
the
moon
or
a
deed
for
the
public
square
he
felt
very
very
low
as
he
hurried
back
home
to
supper
which
he
would
have
to
go
without
if
he
were
not
on
hand
at
the
usual
but
just
when
his
spirits
were
lowest
and
his
outlook
for
the
future
most
hopeless
a
measure
of
relief
was
at
hand
he
noticed
when
he
reached
home
that
braboy
was
a
little
preoccupied
and
did
not
abuse
him
as
vigorously
as
he
expected
after
so
long
an
absence
he
also
perceived
the
smell
of
strange
tobacco
in
the
house
of
a
better
grade
than
he
could
afford
to
use
he
thought
perhaps
some
one
had
come
in
to
see
about
the
washing
but
he
was
too
glad
of
a
respite
from
braboy
rhetoric
to
imperil
it
by
indiscreet
questions
next
morning
she
gave
him
fifty
cents
braboy
she
said
ye
helpin
me
nicely
wid
the
washin
i
going
ter
give
ye
a
holiday
ye
can
take
yer
hook
an
line
an
go
fishin
on
the
breakwater
i
fix
ye
a
lunch
an
ye
need
come
back
till
night
an
there
half
a
dollar
ye
can
buy
yerself
a
pipe
er
terbacky
but
be
careful
an
do
waste
it
she
added
for
fear
she
was
overdoing
the
thing
uncle
wellington
was
overjoyed
at
this
change
of
front
on
the
part
of
braboy
if
she
would
make
it
permanent
he
did
not
see
why
they
might
not
live
together
very
comfortably
the
day
passed
pleasantly
down
on
the
breakwater
the
weather
was
agreeable
and
the
fish
bit
freely
towards
evening
wellington
started
home
with
a
bunch
of
fish
that
no
angler
need
have
been
ashamed
of
he
looked
forward
to
a
good
warm
supper
for
even
if
something
should
have
happened
during
the
day
to
alter
his
wife
mood
for
the
worse
any
ordinary
variation
would
be
more
than
balanced
by
the
substantial
addition
of
food
to
their
larder
his
mouth
watered
at
the
thought
of
the
finny
beauties
sputtering
in
the
he
noted
as
he
approached
the
house
that
there
was
no
smoke
coming
from
the
chimney
this
only
disturbed
him
in
connection
with
the
matter
of
supper
when
he
entered
the
gate
he
observed
further
that
the
had
been
taken
down
de
ole
been
he
said
to
himself
i
wonder
she
did
n
make
me
stay
an
he
went
round
to
the
rear
of
the
house
and
tried
the
kitchen
door
it
was
locked
this
was
somewhat
of
a
surprise
and
disturbed
still
further
his
expectations
in
regard
to
supper
when
he
had
found
the
key
and
opened
the
door
the
gravity
of
his
next
discovery
drove
away
for
the
time
being
all
thoughts
of
eating
the
kitchen
was
empty
stove
table
chairs
pots
and
pans
had
vanished
as
if
into
thin
air
fo
de
lawd
sake
he
murmured
in
astonishment
he
passed
into
the
other
room
they
had
only
two
which
had
served
as
bedroom
and
it
was
as
bare
as
the
first
except
that
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
were
piled
uncle
wellington
clothes
it
was
not
a
large
pile
and
on
the
top
of
it
lay
a
folded
piece
of
yellow
wellington
stood
for
a
moment
as
if
petrified
then
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
around
him
do
dis
mean
he
said
is
i
er
does
i
see
i
ter
see
he
glanced
down
at
the
bunch
of
fish
which
he
still
held
heah
de
fish
heah
de
house
heah
i
is
but
whar
de
ole
an
whar
de
ca
figure
out
dis
yer
all
means
he
picked
up
the
piece
of
paper
and
unfolded
it
it
was
written
on
one
side
here
was
the
obvious
solution
of
the
mystery
that
is
it
would
have
been
obvious
if
he
could
have
read
it
but
he
could
not
and
so
his
fancy
continued
to
play
upon
the
subject
perhaps
the
house
had
been
robbed
or
the
furniture
taken
back
by
the
seller
for
it
had
not
been
entirely
paid
for
finally
he
went
across
the
street
and
called
to
a
boy
in
a
yard
does
you
read
writin
johnnie
yes
sir
i
in
the
seventh
grade
read
dis
yer
paper

but
now
agin
katie
flannigan
i
lavin
town
terday
so
it
wo
be
no
use
lookin
fer
me
on
inquiry
uncle
wellington
learned
from
the
boy
that
shortly
after
his
departure
in
the
morning
a
white
man
had
appeared
on
the
scene
followed
a
little
later
by
a
into
which
the
furniture
had
been
loaded
and
carried
away
braboy
clad
in
her
best
clothes
had
locked
the
door
and
gone
away
with
the
strange
white
man
the
news
was
soon
noised
about
the
street
wellington
swapped
his
fish
for
supper
and
a
bed
at
a
neighbor
and
during
the
evening
learned
from
several
sources
that
the
strange
white
man
had
been
at
his
house
the
afternoon
of
the
day
before
his
neighbors
intimated
that
they
thought
braboy
departure
a
good
riddance
of
bad
rubbish
and
wellington
did
not
dispute
the
proposition
thus
ended
the
second
chapter
of
wellington
matrimonial
experiences
his
wife
departure
had
been
the
one
thing
needful
to
convince
him
beyond
a
doubt
that
he
had
been
a
great
fool
remorse
and
homesickness
forced
him
to
the
further
conclusion
that
he
had
been
knave
as
well
as
fool
and
had
treated
aunt
milly
shamefully
he
was
not
altogether
a
bad
old
man
though
very
weak
and
erring
and
his
better
nature
now
gained
the
ascendency
of
course
his
disappointment
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
his
remorse
most
people
do
not
perceive
the
hideousness
of
sin
until
they
begin
to
reap
its
consequences
instead
of
the
beautiful
northern
life
he
had
dreamed
of
he
found
himself
stranded
penniless
in
a
strange
land
among
people
whose
sympathy
he
had
forfeited
with
no
one
to
lean
upon
and
no
refuge
from
the
storms
of
life
his
outlook
was
very
dark
and
there
sprang
up
within
him
a
wild
longing
to
get
back
to
north
carolina
back
to
the
little
whitewashed
cabin
shaded
with
china
and
mulberry
trees
back
to
the
and
the
garden
back
to
the
old
cronies
with
whom
he
had
swapped
lies
and
tobacco
for
so
many
years
he
longed
to
kiss
the
rod
of
aunt
milly
domination
he
had
purchased
his
liberty
at
too
great
a
price
the
next
day
he
disappeared
from
groveland
he
had
announced
his
departure
only
to
johnson
who
sent
his
love
to
his
relations
in
patesville
it
would
be
painful
to
record
in
detail
the
return
journey
of
uncle
wellington
braboy
no
longer
to
his
native
town
how
many
weary
miles
he
walked
how
many
times
he
risked
his
life
on
railroad
tracks
and
between
freight
cars
how
he
depended
for
sustenance
on
the
grudging
hand
of
charity
nor
would
it
be
profitable
or
delicate
to
mention
any
slight
deviations
from
the
path
of
rectitude
as
judged
by
conventional
standards
to
which
he
may
occasionally
have
been
driven
by
a
too
insistent
hunger
or
to
refer
in
the
remotest
degree
to
a
compulsory
sojourn
of
thirty
days
in
a
city
where
he
had
no
references
and
could
show
no
visible
means
of
support
true
charity
will
let
these
purely
personal
matters
remain
locked
in
the
bosom
of
him
who
suffered
them
iv
just
fifteen
months
after
the
date
when
uncle
wellington
had
left
north
carolina
a
figure
entered
the
town
of
patesville
after
nightfall
following
the
railroad
track
from
the
north
few
would
have
recognized
in
the
old
brown
tramp
clad
in
dusty
rags
and
limping
along
with
bare
feet
the
mulatto
who
so
few
months
before
had
taken
the
train
from
patesville
for
the
distant
north
so
if
he
had
but
known
it
there
was
no
necessity
for
him
to
avoid
the
main
streets
and
sneak
around
by
unfrequented
paths
to
reach
the
old
place
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
he
encountered
nobody
that
he
knew
and
soon
the
familiar
shape
of
the
little
cabin
rose
before
him
it
stood
distinctly
outlined
against
the
sky
and
the
light
streaming
from
the
shutters
showed
it
to
be
occupied
as
he
drew
nearer
every
familiar
detail
of
the
place
appealed
to
his
memory
and
to
his
affections
and
his
heart
went
out
to
the
old
home
and
the
old
wife
as
he
came
nearer
still
the
odor
of
fried
chicken
floated
out
upon
the
air
and
set
his
mouth
to
watering
and
awakened
unspeakable
longings
in
his
stomach
at
this
moment
however
a
fearful
thought
struck
him
suppose
the
old
woman
had
taken
legal
advice
and
married
again
during
his
absence
turn
about
would
have
been
only
fair
play
he
opened
the
gate
softly
and
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
approached
the
window
on
tiptoe
and
looked
in
a
cheerful
fire
was
blazing
on
the
hearth
in
front
of
which
sat
the
familiar
form
of
aunt
milly
and
another
at
the
sight
of
whom
uncle
wellington
heart
sank
within
him
he
knew
the
other
person
very
well
he
had
sat
there
more
than
once
before
uncle
wellington
went
away
it
was
the
minister
of
the
church
to
which
his
wife
belonged
the
preacher
former
visits
however
had
signified
nothing
more
than
pastoral
courtesy
or
appreciation
of
good
eating
his
presence
now
was
of
serious
portent
for
wellington
recalled
with
acute
alarm
that
the
elder
wife
had
died
only
a
few
weeks
before
his
own
departure
for
the
north
what
was
the
occasion
of
his
presence
this
evening
was
it
merely
a
pastoral
call
or
was
he
courting
or
had
aunt
milly
taken
legal
advice
and
married
the
elder
wellington
remembered
a
crack
in
the
wall
at
the
back
of
the
house
through
which
he
could
see
and
hear
and
quietly
stationed
himself
there
dat
chicken

mighty
good
sis

the
elder
was

uncle
wellington
knees
already
weak
from
fasting
trembled
violently
beneath
him
the
worst
that
he
had
feared
was
now
likely
to
happen
his
only
hope
of
safety
lay
in
flight
and
yet
the
scene
within
so
fascinated
him
that
he
could
not
move
a
step
it
serve
him
right
exclaimed
aunt

the
recital
of
her
wrongs
had
wrought
upon
aunt
milly
feelings
so
that
her
voice
broke
and
she
wiped
her
eyes
with
her
apron
the
elder
looked
serenely
confident
and
moved
his
chair
nearer
hers
in
order
the
better
to
play
the
role
of
comforter
wellington
on
the
outside
felt
so
mean
that
the
darkness
of
the
night
was
scarcely
sufficient
to
hide
him
it
would
be
no
more
than
right
if
the

mary
myrover
friends
were
somewhat
surprised
when
she
began
to
teach
a
colored
school
miss
myrover
friends
are
mentioned
here
because
nowhere
more
than
in
a
southern
town
is
public
opinion
a
force
which
can
not
be
lightly
contravened
public
opinion
however
did
not
oppose
miss
myrover
teaching
colored
children
in
fact
all
the
colored
public
schools
in
town
and
there
were
several
were
taught
by
white
teachers
and
had
been
so
taught
since
the
state
had
undertaken
to
provide
free
public
instruction
for
all
children
within
its
boundaries
previous
to
that
time
there
had
been
a
freedman
bureau
school
and
a
presbyterian
missionary
school
but
these
had
been
withdrawn
when
the
need
for
them
became
less
pressing
the
colored
people
of
the
town
had
been
for
some
time
agitating
their
right
to
teach
their
own
schools
but
as
yet
the
claim
had
not
been
conceded
the
reason
miss
myrover
course
created
some
surprise
was
not
therefore
the
fact
that
a
southern
white
woman
should
teach
a
colored
school
it
lay
in
the
fact
that
up
to
this
time
no
woman
of
just
her
quality
had
taken
up
such
work
most
of
the
teachers
of
colored
schools
were
not
of
those
who
had
constituted
the
aristocracy
of
the
old
régime
they
might
be
said
rather
to
represent
the
new
order
of
things
in
which
labor
was
in
time
to
become
honorable
and
men
were
after
a
somewhat
longer
time
to
depend
for
their
place
in
society
upon
themselves
rather
than
upon
their
ancestors
mary
myrover
belonged
to
one
of
the
proudest
of
the
old
families
her
ancestors
had
been
people
of
distinction
in
virginia
before
a
collateral
branch
of
the
main
stock
had
settled
in
north
carolina
before
the
war
they
had
been
able
to
live
up
to
their
pedigree
but
the
war
brought
sad
changes
miss
father
the
colonel
myrover
who
led
a
gallant
but
desperate
charge
at
vicksburg
had
fallen
on
the
battlefield
and
his
tomb
in
the
white
cemetery
was
a
shrine
for
the
family
on
the
confederate
memorial
day
no
other
grave
was
so
profusely
decorated
with
flowers
and
in
the
oration
pronounced
the
name
of
colonel
myrover
was
always
used
to
illustrate
the
highest
type
of
patriotic
devotion
and
miss
myrover
brother
too
had
fallen
in
the
conflict
but
his
bones
lay
in
some
unknown
trench
with
those
of
a
thousand
others
who
had
fallen
on
the
same
field
ay
more
her
lover
who
had
hoped
to
come
home
in
the
full
tide
of
victory
and
claim
his
bride
as
a
reward
for
gallantry
had
shared
the
fate
of
her
father
and
brother
when
the
war
was
over
the
remnant
of
the
family
found
itself
involved
in
the
common
ruin
more
deeply
involved
indeed
than
some
others
for
colonel
myrover
had
believed
in
the
ultimate
triumph
of
his
cause
and
had
invested
most
of
his
wealth
in
confederate
bonds
which
were
now
only
so
much
waste
paper
there
had
been
a
little
left
myrover
was
thrifty
and
had
laid
by
a
few
hundred
dollars
which
she
kept
in
the
house
to
meet
unforeseen
contingencies
there
remained
too
their
home
with
an
ample
garden
and
a
orchard
besides
a
considerable
tract
of
country
land
partly
cleared
but
productive
of
very
little
revenue
with
their
shrunken
resources
miss
myrover
and
her
mother
were
able
to
hold
up
their
heads
without
embarrassment
for
some
years
after
the
close
of
the
war
but
when
things
were
adjusted
to
the
changed
conditions
and
the
stream
of
life
began
to
flow
more
vigorously
in
the
new
channels
they
saw
themselves
in
danger
of
dropping
behind
unless
in
some
way
they
could
add
to
their
meagre
income
miss
myrover
looked
over
the
field
of
employment
never
very
wide
for
women
in
the
south
and
found
it
occupied
the
only
available
position
she
could
be
supposed
prepared
to
fill
and
which
she
could
take
without
distinct
loss
of
caste
was
that
of
a
teacher
and
there
was
no
vacancy
except
in
one
of
the
colored
schools
even
teaching
was
a
doubtful
experiment
it
was
not
what
she
would
have
preferred
but
it
was
the
best
that
could
be
done
i
like
it
mary
said
her
mother
it
a
long
step
from
owning
such
people
to
teaching
them
what
do
they
need
with
education
it
will
only
make
them
unfit
for
work
they
free
now
mother
and
perhaps
they
work
better
if
they
taught
something
besides
it
only
a
business
arrangement
and
does
involve
any
closer
contact
than
we
have
with
our
servants
well
i
should
say
not
sniffed
the
old
lady
not
one
of
them
will
ever
dare
to
presume
on
your
position
to
take
any
liberties
with
us
see
to
that
miss
myrover
began
her
work
as
a
teacher
in
the
autumn
at
the
opening
of
the
school
year
it
was
a
novel
experience
at
first
though
there
had
always
been
negro
servants
in
the
house
and
though
on
the
streets
colored
people
were
more
numerous
than
those
of
her
own
race
and
though
she
was
so
familiar
with
their
dialect
that
she
might
almost
be
said
to
speak
it
barring
certain
characteristic
grammatical
inaccuracies
she
had
never
been
brought
in
personal
contact
with
so
many
of
them
at
once
as
when
she
confronted
the
fifty
or
sixty
faces
of
colors
ranging
from
a
white
almost
as
clear
as
her
own
to
the
darkest
livery
of
the
sun
which
were
gathered
in
the
schoolroom
on
the
morning
when
she
began
her
duties
some
of
the
inherited
prejudice
of
her
caste
too
made
itself
felt
though
she
tried
to
repress
any
outward
sign
of
it
and
she
could
perceive
that
the
children
were
not
altogether
responsive
they
likewise
were
not
entirely
free
from
antagonism
the
work
was
unfamiliar
to
her
she
was
not
physically
very
strong
and
at
the
close
of
the
first
day
went
home
with
a
splitting
headache
if
she
could
have
resigned
then
and
there
without
causing
comment
or
annoyance
to
others
she
would
have
felt
it
a
privilege
to
do
so
but
a
night
rest
banished
her
headache
and
improved
her
spirits
and
the
next
morning
she
went
to
her
work
with
renewed
vigor
fortified
by
the
experience
of
the
first
day
miss
myrover
second
day
was
more
satisfactory
she
had
some
natural
talent
for
organization
though
hitherto
unaware
of
it
and
in
the
course
of
the
day
she
got
her
classes
formed
and
lessons
under
way
in
a
week
or
two
she
began
to
classify
her
pupils
in
her
own
mind
as
bright
or
stupid
mischievous
or
well
behaved
lazy
or
industrious
as
the
case
might
be
and
to
regulate
her
discipline
accordingly
that
she
had
come
of
a
long
line
of
ancestors
who
had
exercised
authority
and
mastership
was
perhaps
not
without
its
effect
upon
her
character
and
enabled
her
more
readily
to
maintain
good
order
in
the
school
when
she
was
fairly
broken
in
she
found
the
work
rather
to
her
liking
and
derived
much
pleasure
from
such
success
as
she
achieved
as
a
teacher
it
was
natural
that
she
should
be
more
attracted
to
some
of
her
pupils
than
to
others
perhaps
her
favorite
or
rather
the
one
she
liked
best
for
she
was
too
fair
and
just
for
conscious
favoritism
was
sophy
tucker
just
the
ground
for
the
teacher
liking
for
sophy
might
not
at
first
be
apparent
the
girl
was
far
from
the
whitest
of
miss
pupils
in
fact
she
was
one
of
the
darker
ones
she
was
not
the
brightest
in
intellect
though
she
always
tried
to
learn
her
lessons
she
was
not
the
best
dressed
for
her
mother
was
a
poor
widow
who
went
out
washing
and
scrubbing
for
a
living
perhaps
the
real
tie
between
them
was
sophy
intense
devotion
to
the
teacher
it
had
manifested
itself
almost
from
the
first
day
of
the
school
in
the
rapt
look
of
admiration
miss
myrover
always
saw
on
the
little
black
face
turned
toward
her
in
it
there
was
nothing
of
envy
nothing
of
regret
nothing
but
worship
for
the
beautiful
white
lady
she
was
not
especially
handsome
but
to
sophy
her
beauty
was
almost
divine
who
had
come
to
teach
her
if
miss
myrover
dropped
a
book
sophy
was
the
first
to
spring
and
pick
it
up
if
she
wished
a
chair
moved
sophy
seemed
to
anticipate
her
wish
and
so
of
all
the
numberless
little
services
that
can
be
rendered
in
a
schoolroom
miss
myrover
was
fond
of
flowers
and
liked
to
have
them
about
her
the
children
soon
learned
of
this
taste
of
hers
and
kept
the
vases
on
her
desk
filled
with
blossoms
during
their
season
sophy
was
perhaps
the
most
active
in
providing
them
if
she
could
not
get
garden
flowers
she
would
make
excursions
to
the
woods
in
the
early
morning
and
bring
in
great
bunches
of
bay
or
jasmine
or
some
other
fragrant
forest
flower
which
she
knew
the
teacher
loved
when
i
die
sophy
miss
myrover
said
to
the
child
one
day
i
want
to
be
covered
with
roses
and
when
they
bury
me
i
sure
i
shall
rest
better
if
my
grave
is
banked
with
flowers
and
roses
are
planted
at
my
head
and
at
my
feet
miss
myrover
was
at
first
amused
at
sophy
devotion
but
when
she
grew
more
accustomed
to
it
she
found
it
rather
to
her
liking
it
had
a
sort
of
flavor
of
the
old
régime
and
she
felt
when
she
bestowed
her
kindly
notice
upon
her
little
black
attendant
some
of
the
feudal
condescension
of
the
mistress
toward
the
slave
she
was
kind
to
sophy
and
permitted
her
to
play
the
rôle
she
had
assumed
which
caused
sometimes
a
little
jealousy
among
the
other
girls
once
she
gave
sophy
a
yellow
ribbon
which
she
took
from
her
own
hair
the
child
carried
it
home
and
cherished
it
as
a
priceless
treasure
to
be
worn
only
on
the
greatest
occasions
sophy
had
a
rival
in
her
attachment
to
the
teacher
but
the
rivalry
was
altogether
friendly
miss
myrover
had
a
little
dog
a
white
spaniel
answering
to
the
name
of
prince
prince
was
a
dog
of
high
degree
and
would
have
very
little
to
do
with
the
children
of
the
school
he
made
an
exception
however
in
the
case
of
sophy
whose
devotion
for
his
mistress
he
seemed
to
comprehend
he
was
a
clever
dog
and
could
fetch
and
carry
sit
up
on
his
haunches
extend
his
paw
to
shake
hands
and
possessed
several
other
canine
accomplishments
he
was
very
fond
of
his
mistress
and
always
unless
shut
up
at
home
accompanied
her
to
school
where
he
spent
most
of
his
time
lying
under
the
teacher
desk
or
in
cold
weather
by
the
stove
except
when
he
would
go
out
now
and
then
and
chase
an
imaginary
rabbit
round
the
yard
presumably
for
exercise
at
school
sophy
and
prince
vied
with
each
other
in
their
attentions
to
miss
myrover
but
when
school
was
over
prince
went
away
with
her
and
sophy
stayed
behind
for
miss
myrover
was
white
and
sophy
was
black
which
they
both
understood
perfectly
well
miss
myrover
taught
the
colored
children
but
she
could
not
be
seen
with
them
in
public
if
they
occasionally
met
her
on
the
street
they
did
not
expect
her
to
speak
to
them
unless
she
happened
to
be
alone
and
no
other
white
person
was
in
sight
if
any
of
the
children
felt
slighted
she
was
not
aware
of
it
for
she
intended
no
slight
she
had
not
been
brought
up
to
speak
to
negroes
on
the
street
and
she
could
not
act
differently
from
other
people
and
though
she
was
a
woman
of
sentiment
and
capable
of
deep
feeling
her
training
had
been
such
that
she
hardly
expected
to
find
in
those
of
darker
hue
than
herself
the
same
susceptibility
varying
in
degree
perhaps
but
yet
the
same
in
kind
that
gave
to
her
own
life
the
alternations
of
feeling
that
made
it
most
worth
living
once
miss
myrover
wished
to
carry
home
a
parcel
of
books
she
had
the
bundle
in
her
hand
when
sophy
came
up
lem
me
tote
yo
bundle
fer
yer
miss
she
asked
eagerly
i
gwine
yo
way
thank
you
sophy
was
the
reply
i
be
glad
if
you
will
sophy
followed
the
teacher
at
a
respectful
distance
when
they
reached
miss
myrover
home
sophy
carried
the
bundle
to
the
doorstep
where
miss
myrover
took
it
and
thanked
her
myrover
came
out
on
the
piazza
as
sophy
was
moving
away
she
said
in
the
child
hearing
and
perhaps
with
the
intention
that
she
should
hear
mary
i
wish
you
would
let
those
little
darkeys
follow
you
to
the
house
i
do
want
them
in
the
yard
i
should
think
you
have
enough
of
them
all
day
very
well
mother
replied
her
daughter
i
wo
bring
any
more
of
them
the
child
was
only
doing
me
a
favor
myrover
was
an
invalid
and
opposition
or
irritation
of
any
kind
brought
on
nervous
paroxysms
that
made
her
miserable
and
made
life
a
burden
to
the
rest
of
the
household
so
that
mary
seldom
crossed
her
whims
she
did
not
bring
sophy
to
the
house
again
nor
did
sophy
again
offer
her
services
as
porter
one
day
in
spring
sophy
brought
her
teacher
a
bouquet
of
yellow
roses
dey
come
my
own
bush
miss
she
said
proudly
an
i
let
nobody
pull
but
saved
all
fer
you
i
know
you
likes
roses
so
much
i
gwine
bring
all
ter
you
as
long
as
dey
las
thank
you
sophy
said
the
teacher
you
are
a
very
good
girl
for
another
year
mary
myrover
taught
the
colored
school
and
did
excellent
service
the
children
made
rapid
progress
under
her
tuition
and
learned
to
love
her
well
for
they
saw
and
appreciated
as
well
as
children
could
her
fidelity
to
a
trust
that
she
might
have
slighted
as
some
others
did
without
much
fear
of
criticism
toward
the
end
of
her
second
year
she
sickened
and
after
a
brief
illness
died
old
myrover
was
inconsolable
she
ascribed
her
daughter
death
to
her
labors
as
teacher
of
negro
children
just
how
the
color
of
the
pupils
had
produced
the
fatal
effects
she
did
not
stop
to
explain
but
she
was
too
old
and
had
suffered
too
deeply
from
the
war
in
body
and
mind
and
estate
ever
to
reconcile
herself
to
the
changed
order
of
things
following
the
return
of
peace
and
with
an
unsound
yet
perfectly
explainable
logic
she
visited
some
of
her
displeasure
upon
those
who
had
profited
most
though
passively
by
her
losses
i
always
feared
something
would
happen
to
mary
she
said
it
seemed
unnatural
for
her
to
be
wearing
herself
out
teaching
little
negroes
who
ought
to
have
been
working
for
her
but
the
world
has
hardly
been
a
fit
place
to
live
in
since
the
war
and
when
i
follow
her
as
i
must
before
long
i
shall
not
be
sorry
to
go
she
gave
strict
orders
that
no
colored
people
should
be
admitted
to
the
house
some
of
her
friends
heard
of
this
and
remonstrated
they
knew
the
teacher
was
loved
by
the
pupils
and
felt
that
sincere
respect
from
the
humble
would
be
a
worthy
tribute
to
the
proudest
but
myrover
was
obdurate
they
had
my
daughter
when
she
was
alive
she
said
and
they
killed
her
but
she
mine
now
and
i
wo
have
them
come
near
her
i
do
want
one
of
them
at
the
funeral
or
anywhere
around
for
a
month
before
miss
myrover
death
sophy
had
been
watching
her
rosebush
the
one
that
bore
the
yellow
roses
for
the
first
buds
of
spring
and
when
these
appeared
had
awaited
impatiently
their
gradual
unfolding
but
not
until
her
teacher
death
had
they
become
roses
when
miss
myrover
died
sophy
determined
to
pluck
the
roses
and
lay
them
on
her
coffin
perhaps
she
thought
they
might
even
put
them
in
her
hand
or
on
her
breast
for
sophy
remembered
miss
myrover
thanks
and
praise
when
she
had
brought
her
the
yellow
roses
the
spring
before
on
the
morning
of
the
day
set
for
the
funeral
sophy
washed
her
face
until
it
shone
combed
and
brushed
her
hair
with
painful
conscientiousness
put
on
her
best
frock
plucked
her
yellow
roses
and
tying
them
with
the
treasured
ribbon
her
teacher
had
given
her
set
out
for
miss
myrover
home
she
went
round
to
the
side
gate
the
house
stood
on
a
corner
and
stole
up
the
path
to
the
kitchen
a
colored
woman
whom
she
did
not
know
came
to
the
door
wat

inquired

a
moment
after
she
had
gone
there
was
a
step
in
the
hall
and
old
myrover
came
into
the
kitchen
dinah
she
said
in
a
peevish
tone
dinah
receiving
no
answer
myrover
peered
around
the
kitchen
and
caught
sight
of
sophy
what
are
you
doing
here
she
demanded
waitin
ter
see
de
cook
stammered
sophy
the
cook

where
she
is
besides
my
daughter

to
be
buried
and
i

until
the
funeral
is
over
come
back
some
other
day
or
see
the
cook
at
her
own
home
in
the
evening
she
stood
waiting
for
the
child
to
go
and
under
the
keen
glance
of
her
eyes
sophy
feeling
as
though
she
had
been
caught
in
some
disgraceful
act
hurried
down
the
walk
and
out
of
the
gate
with
her
bouquet
in
her
hand
dinah
said
myrover
when
the
cook
came
back
i
do
want
any
strange
people
admitted
here
the
house
will
be
full
of
our
friends
and
we
have
no
room
for
others
yas
said
the
cook
she
understood
perfectly
what
her
mistress
meant
and
what
the
cook
thought
about
her
mistress
was
a
matter
of
no
consequence
the
funeral
services
were
held
at
paul
episcopal
church
where
the
myrovers
had
always
worshiped
quite
a
number
of
miss
myrover
pupils
went
to
the
church
to
attend
the
services
the
building
was
not
a
large
one
there
was
a
small
gallery
at
the
rear
to
which
colored
people
were
admitted
if
they
chose
to
come
at
ordinary
services
and
those
who
wished
to
be
present
at
the
funeral
supposed
that
the
usual
custom
would
prevail
they
were
therefore
surprised
when
they
went
to
the
side
entrance
by
which
colored
people
gained
access
to
the
gallery
stairs
to
be
met
by
an
usher
who
barred
their
passage
i
sorry
he
said
but
i
have
had
orders
to
admit
no
one
until
the
friends
of
the
family
have
all
been
seated
if
you
wish
to
wait
until
the
white
people
have
all
gone
in
and
there
any
room
left
you
may
be
able
to
get
into
the
back
part
of
the
gallery
of
course
i
ca
tell
yet
whether
there
be
any
room
or
not
now
the
statement
of
the
usher
was
a
very
reasonable
one
but
strange
to
say
none
of
the
colored
people
chose
to
remain
except
sophy
she
still
hoped
to
use
her
floral
offering
for
its
destined
end
in
some
way
though
she
did
not
know
just
how
she
waited
in
the
yard
until
the
church
was
filled
with
white
people
and
a
number
who
could
not
gain
admittance
were
standing
about
the
doors
then
she
went
round
to
the
side
of
the
church
and
depositing
her
bouquet
carefully
on
an
old
mossy
gravestone
climbed
up
on
the
projecting
sill
of
a
window
near
the
chancel
the
window
was
of
stained
glass
of
somewhat
ancient
make
the
church
was
old
had
indeed
been
built
in
colonial
times
and
the
stained
glass
had
been
brought
from
england
the
design
of
the
window
showed
jesus
blessing
little
children
time
had
dealt
gently
with
the
window
but
just
at
the
feet
of
the
figure
of
jesus
a
small
triangular
piece
of
glass
had
been
broken
out
to
this
aperture
sophy
applied
her
eyes
and
through
it
saw
and
heard
what
she
could
of
the
services
within
before
the
chancel
on
trestles
draped
in
black
stood
the
sombre
casket
in
which
lay
all
that
was
mortal
of
her
dear
teacher
the
top
of
the
casket
was
covered
with
flowers
and
lying
stretched
out
underneath
it
she
saw
miss
myrover
little
white
dog
prince
he
had
followed
the
body
to
the
church
and
slipping
in
unnoticed
among
the
mourners
had
taken
his
place
from
which
no
one
had
the
heart
to
remove
him
the
rector
read
the
solemn
service
for
the
dead
and
then
delivered
a
brief
address
in
which
he
dwelt
upon
the
uncertainty
of
life
and
to
the
believer
the
certain
blessedness
of
eternity
he
spoke
of
miss
myrover
kindly
spirit
and
as
an
illustration
of
her
love
and
for
others
referred
to
her
labors
as
a
teacher
of
the
poor
ignorant
negroes
who
had
been
placed
in
their
midst
by
an
providence
and
whom
it
was
their
duty
to
guide
and
direct
in
the
station
in
which
god
had
put
them
then
the
organ
pealed
a
prayer
was
said
and
the
long
cortege
moved
from
the
church
to
the
cemetery
about
half
a
mile
away
where
the
body
was
to
be
interred
when
the
services
were
over
sophy
sprang
down
from
her
perch
and
taking
her
flowers
followed
the
procession
she
did
not
walk
with
the
rest
but
at
a
proper
and
respectful
distance
from
the
last
mourner
no
one
noticed
the
little
black
girl
with
the
bunch
of
yellow
flowers
or
thought
of
her
as
interested
in
the
funeral
the
cortege
reached
the
cemetery
and
filed
slowly
through
the
gate
but
sophy
stood
outside
looking
at
a
small
sign
in
white
letters
on
a
black
background
this
cemetery
is
for
white
people
only
others
please
keep
out
sophy
thanks
to
miss
myrover
painstaking
instruction
could
read
this
sign
very
distinctly
in
fact
she
had
often
read
it
before
for
sophy
was
a
child
who
loved
beauty
in
a
blind
groping
sort
of
way
and
had
sometimes
stood
by
the
fence
of
the
cemetery
and
looked
through
at
the
green
mounds
and
shaded
walks
and
blooming
flowers
within
and
wished
that
she
might
walk
among
them
she
knew
too
that
the
little
sign
on
the
gate
though
so
courteously
worded
was
no
mere
formality
for
she
had
heard
how
a
colored
man
who
had
wandered
into
the
cemetery
on
a
hot
night
and
fallen
asleep
on
the
flat
top
of
a
tomb
had
been
arrested
as
a
vagrant
and
fined
five
dollars
which
he
had
worked
out
on
the
streets
with
a
attachment
at
cents
a
day
since
that
time
the
cemetery
gate
had
been
locked
at
night
so
sophy
stayed
outside
and
looked
through
the
fence
her
poor
bouquet
had
begun
to
droop
by
this
time
and
the
yellow
ribbon
had
lost
some
of
its
freshness
sophy
could
see
the
rector
standing
by
the
grave
the
mourners
gathered
round
she
could
faintly
distinguish
the
solemn
words
with
which
ashes
were
committed
to
ashes
and
dust
to
dust
she
heard
the
hollow
thud
of
the
earth
falling
on
the
coffin
and
she
leaned
against
the
iron
fence
sobbing
softly
until
the
grave
was
filled
and
rounded
off
and
the
wreaths
and
other
floral
pieces
were
disposed
upon
it
when
the
mourners
began
to
move
toward
the
gate
sophy
walked
slowly
down
the
street
in
a
direction
opposite
to
that
taken
by
most
of
the
people
who
came
out
when
they
had
all
gone
away
and
the
sexton
had
come
out
and
locked
the
gate
behind
him
sophy
crept
back
her
roses
were
faded
now
and
from
some
of
them
the
petals
had
fallen
she
stood
there
irresolute
loath
to
leave
with
her
heart
desire
unsatisfied
when
as
her
eyes
sought
again
the
teacher
last
she
saw
lying
beside
the
grave
what
looked
like
a
small
bundle
of
white
wool
eyes
lighted
up
with
a
sudden
glow
prince
here
prince
she
called
the
little
dog
rose
and
trotted
down
to
the
gate
sophy
pushed
the
poor
bouquet
between
the
iron
bars
take
that
ter
miss
prince
she
said
that
a
good
doggie
the
dog
wagged
his
tail
intelligently
took
the
bouquet
carefully
in
his
mouth
carried
it
to
his
mistress
grave
and
laid
it
among
the
other
flowers
the
bunch
of
roses
was
so
small
that
from
where
she
stood
sophy
could
see
only
a
dash
of
yellow
against
the
white
background
of
the
mass
of
flowers
when
prince
had
performed
his
mission
he
turned
his
eyes
toward
sophy
inquiringly
and
when
she
gave
him
a
nod
of
approval
lay
down
and
resumed
his
watch
by
the
graveside
sophy
looked
at
him
a
moment
with
a
feeling
very
much
like
envy
and
then
turned
and
moved
slowly
away
the
web
of
circumstance
i
within
a
low
clapboarded
hut
with
an
open
front
a
forge
was
glowing
in
front
a
blacksmith
was
shoeing
a
horse
a
sleek
animal
with
the
signs
of
good
blood
and
breeding
a
young
mulatto
stood
by
and
handed
the
blacksmith
such
tools
as
he
needed
from
time
to
time
a
group
of
negroes
were
sitting
around
some
in
the
shadow
of
the
shop
one
in
the
full
glare
of
the
sunlight
a
gentleman
was
seated
in
a
buggy
a
few
yards
away
in
the
shade
of
a
spreading
elm
the
horse
had
loosened
a
shoe
and
colonel
thornton
who
was
a
lover
of
fine
horseflesh
and
careful
of
it
had
stopped
at
ben
davis
blacksmith
shop
as
soon
as
he
discovered
the
loose
shoe
to
have
it
fastened
on
all
right
kunnel
the
blacksmith
called
out
tom
he
said
addressing
the
young
man

up
colonel
thornton
alighted
from
the
buggy
looked
at
the
shoe
signified
his
approval
of
the
job
and
stood
looking
on
while
the
blacksmith
and
his
assistant
harnessed
the
horse
to
the
buggy
dat
a
mighty
fine
whip

ben
while
the
young

was

said
the
colonel

the
whip
in
question
was
a
handsome
one
the
handle
was
wrapped
with
interlacing
threads
of
variegated
colors
forming
an
elaborate
pattern
the
lash
being
dark
green
an
octagonal
ornament
of
glass
was
set
in
the
end
of
the
handle
it
is
fine
said
ben

looked
at

whip
longingly
as

one
of

by

time
he
went
on
giving
a
finishing
blow
to
a
horseshoe
and
throwing
it
on
the
ground
to
cool
carried
away
by
his
own
eloquence
he
did
not
notice
the
approach
of
two
white
men
who
came
up
the
street
from
behind
him
an
ef
you

he
continued
raking
the
coals
together
over

till
they
got

the
conversation
took
another
turn
the
white
men
transacted
their
business
and
went
away
the
whistle
of
a
neighboring
steam
sawmill
blew
a
raucous
blast
for
the
hour
of
noon
and
the
loafers
shuffled
away
in
different
directions

the

the
young
man
walked
away
one
would
have
supposed
from
the
rapidity
with
which
he
walked
that
he
was
very
hungry
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
blacksmith
dropped
his
hammer
pulled
off
his
leather
apron
shut
the
front
door
of
the
shop
and
went
home
to
dinner
he
came
into
the
house
out
of
the
fervent
heat
and
throwing
off
his
straw
hat
wiped
his
brow
vigorously
with
a
red
cotton
handkerchief

he
said
sniffing
the
odor
that
came
in
through
the
kitchen
door
as
his
yellow
wife
opened
it
to
enter
the
room

the
woman
did
seem
excited
and
ill
at

there
was
a

of

a
quickened
breathing
that
betokened

the

to

whar

he
cried
he
heard
a
rustling
in
the
bushes
at
one
side
of
the
garden
and
the
sound
of
a
breaking
twig
and
seizing
a
hoe
which
stood
by
the
door
he
sprang
toward
the
point
from
which
the
sound
came

the

hurriedly
it

over
here

she
directed
her
husband
attention
to
the
other
side
of
the
garden
the
blacksmith
with
the
uplifted
hoe
its
sharp
blade
gleaming
in
the
sunlight
peered
cautiously
among
the
collards
and
tomato
plants
listening
all
the
while
for
the
ominous
rattle
but
found
nothing
i
reckon
he
got

said
as
he
set
the

up

was
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
garden
from
that
on
which
the
snake
was
said
to
have
been

the

sat
down
and
fanned
himself
with
a
fan

ii
the
case
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
ben
davis
was
called
the
accused
was
led
into
court
and
took
his
seat
in
the
prisoner
dock
prisoner
at
the
bar
stand
up
the
prisoner
pale
and
anxious
stood
up
the
clerk
read
the
indictment
in
which
it
was
charged
that
the
defendant
by
force
and
arms
had
entered
the
barn
of
one
thornton
and
feloniously
taken
therefrom
one
whip
of
the
value
of
fifteen
dollars
are
you
guilty
or
not
guilty
asked
the
judge
not
guilty
yo
honah
not
guilty
jedge
i
never

the
state
attorney
opened
the
case
he
was
young
and
zealous
recently
elected
to
the
office
this
was
his
first
batch
of
cases
and
he
was
anxious
to
make
as
good
a
record
as
possible
he
had
no
doubt
of
the
prisoner
guilt
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
petty
thieving
in
the
county
and
several
gentlemen
had
suggested
to
him
the
necessity
for
greater
severity
in
punishing
it
the
jury
were
all
white
men
the
prosecuting
attorney
stated
the
case
we
expect
to
show
gentlemen
of
the
jury
the
facts
set
out
in
the
indictment
not
altogether
by
direct
proof
but
by
a
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
which
is
stronger
even
than
the
testimony
of
eyewitnesses
men
might
lie
but
circumstances
can
not
we
expect
to
show
that
the
defendant
is
a
man
of
dangerous
character
a
surly
impudent
fellow
a
man
whose
views
of
property
are
prejudicial
to
the
welfare
of
society
and
who
has
been
heard
to
assert
that
half
the
property
which
is
owned
in
this
county
has
been
stolen
and
that
if
justice
were
done
the
white
people
ought
to
divide
up
the
land
with
the
negroes
in
other
words
a
negro
nihilist
a
communist
a
secret
devotee
of
tom
paine
and
voltaire
a
pupil
of
the
anarchist
propaganda
which
if
not
checked
by
the
stern
hand
of
the
law
will
fasten
its
insidious
fangs
on
our
social
system
and
drag
it
down
to
ruin
we
object
may
it
please
your
honor
said
the
defendant
attorney
the
prosecutor
should
defer
his
argument
until
the
testimony
is
in
confine
yourself
to
the
facts
major
said
the
court
mildly
the
prisoner
sat
with
mouth
overwhelmed
by
this
flood
of
eloquence
he
had
never
heard
of
tom
paine
or
voltaire
he
had
no
conception
of
what
a
nihilist
or
an
anarchist
might
be
and
could
not
have
told
the
difference
between
a
propaganda
and
a
potato
we
expect
to
show
may
it
please
the
court
that
the
prisoner
had
been
employed
by
colonel
thornton
to
shoe
a
horse
that
the
horse
was
taken
to
the
prisoner
blacksmith
shop
by
a
servant
of
colonel
thornton
that
this
servant
expressing
a
desire
to
go
somewhere
on
an
errand
before
the
horse
had
been
shod
the
prisoner
volunteered
to
return
the
horse
to
colonel
thornton
stable
that
he
did
so
and
the
following
morning
the
whip
in
question
was
missing
that
from
circumstances
suspicion
naturally
fell
upon
the
prisoner
and
a
search
was
made
of
his
shop
where
the
whip
was
found
secreted
that
the
prisoner
denied
that
the
whip
was
there
but
when
confronted
with
the
evidence
of
his
crime
showed
by
his
confusion
that
he
was
guilty
beyond
a
peradventure
the
prisoner
looked
more
anxious
so
much
eloquence
could
not
but
be
effective
with
the
jury
the
attorney
for
the
defendant
answered
briefly
denying
the
guilt
dwelling
upon
his
previous
good
character
for
honesty
and
begging
the
jury
not
to
the
case
but
to
remember
that
the
law
is
merciful
and
that
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
should
be
given
to
the
prisoner
the
prisoner
glanced
nervously
at
the
jury
there
was
nothing
in
their
faces
to
indicate
the
effect
upon
them
of
the
opening
statements
it
seemed
to
the
disinterested
listeners
as
if
the
defendant
attorney
had
little
confidence
in
his
client
cause
colonel
thornton
took
the
stand
and
testified
to
his
ownership
of
the
whip
the
place
where
it
was
kept
its
value
and
the
fact
that
it
had
disappeared
the
whip
was
produced
in
court
and
identified
by
the
witness
he
also
testified
to
the
conversation
at
the
blacksmith
shop
in
the
course
of
which
the
prisoner
had
expressed
a
desire
to
possess
a
similar
whip
the
was
brief
and
no
attempt
was
made
to
shake
the
colonel
testimony
the
next
witness
was
the
constable
who
had
gone
with
a
warrant
to
search
ben
shop
he
testified
to
the
circumstances
under
which
the
whip
was
found
he
wuz
brazen
as
a
mule
at
fust
an
wanted
ter
git
mad
about
it
but
when
we
begun
ter
turn
over
that
pile
er
truck
in
the
cawner
he
kinder
begun
ter
trimble
when
the
stuck
out
his
eyes
commenced
ter
grow
big
an
when
we
hauled
the
whip
out
he
turned
pale
ez
ashes
an
begun
to
swear
he
did
n
take
the
whip
an
did
n
know
how
it
got
thar
you
may
said
the
prosecuting
attorney
triumphantly
the
prisoner
felt
the
weight
of
the
testimony
and
glanced
furtively
at
the
jury
and
then
appealingly
at
his
lawyer
you
say
that
ben
denied
that
he
had
stolen
the
whip
said
the
prisoner
attorney
on
did
it
not
occur
to
you
that
what
you
took
for
brazen
impudence
might
have
been
but
the
evidence
of
conscious
innocence
the
witness
grinned
incredulously
revealing
thereby
a
few
blackened
fragments
of
teeth
i
tuck
up
more
a
hundred
niggers
fer
stealin
kurnel
an
i
never
seed
one
yit
that
did
n
it
ter
the
las
answer
my
question
might
not
the
witness
indignation
have
been
a
manifestation
of
conscious
innocence
yes
or
no
yes
it
mought
an
the
moon
mought
fall
but
it
do
further
did
not
weaken
the
witness
testimony
which
was
very
damaging
and
every
one
in
the
court
room
felt
instinctively
that
a
strong
defense
would
be
required
to
break
down
the
state
case
the
state
rests
said
the
prosecuting
attorney
with
a
ring
in
his
voice
which
spoke
of
certain
victory
there
was
a
temporary
lull
in
the
proceedings
during
which
a
bailiff
passed
a
pitcher
of
water
and
a
glass
along
the
line
of
the
defense
was
then
begun
the
law
in
its
wisdom
did
not
permit
the
defendant
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf
there
were
no
witnesses
to
the
facts
but
several
were
called
to
testify
to
ben
good
character
the
colored
witnesses
made
him
out
possessed
of
all
the
virtues
one
or
two
white
men
testified
that
they
had
never
known
anything
against
his
reputation
for
honesty
the
defendant
rested
his
case
and
the
state
called
its
witnesses
in
rebuttal
they
were
entirely
on
the
point
of
character
one
testified
that
he
had
heard
the
prisoner
say
that
if
the
negroes
had
their
rights
they
would
own
at
least
half
the
property
another
testified
that
he
had
heard
the
defendant
say
that
the
negroes
spent
too
much
money
on
churches
and
that
they
cared
a
good
deal
more
for
god
than
god
had
ever
seemed
to
care
for
them
ben
davis
listened
to
this
testimony
with
mouth
and
staring
eyes
now
and
then
he
would
lean
forward
and
speak
perhaps
a
word
when
his
attorney
would
shake
a
warning
finger
at
him
and
he
would
fall
back
helplessly
as
if
abandoning
himself
to
fate
but
for
a
moment
only
when
he
would
resume
his
puzzled
look
the
arguments
followed
the
prosecuting
attorney
briefly
summed
up
the
evidence
and
characterized
it
as
almost
a
mathematical
proof
of
the
prisoner
guilt
he
reserved
his
eloquence
for
the
closing
argument
the
defendant
attorney
had
a
headache
and
secretly
believed
his
client
guilty
his
address
sounded
more
like
an
appeal
for
mercy
than
a
demand
for
justice
then
the
state
attorney
delivered
the
maiden
argument
of
his
office
the
speech
that
made
his
reputation
as
an
orator
and
opened
up
to
him
a
successful
political
career
the
judge
charge
to
the
jury
was
a
plain
simple
statement
of
the
law
as
applied
to
circumstantial
evidence
and
the
mere
statement
of
the
law
foreshadowed
the
verdict
the
eyes
of
the
prisoner
were
glued
to
the
and
he
looked
more
and
more
like
a
hunted
animal
in
the
rear
of
the
crowd
of
blacks
who
filled
the
back
part
of
the
room
partly
concealed
by
the
projecting
angle
of
the
fireplace
stood
tom
the
blacksmith
assistant
if
the
face
is
the
mirror
of
the
soul
then
this
man
soul
taken
off
its
guard
in
this
moment
of
excitement
was
full
of
lust
and
envy
and
all
evil
passions
the
jury
filed
out
of
their
box
and
into
the
jury
room
behind
the
judge
stand
there
was
a
moment
of
relaxation
in
the
court
room
the
lawyers
fell
into
conversation
across
the
table
the
judge
beckoned
to
colonel
thornton
who
stepped
forward
and
they
conversed
together
a
few
moments
the
prisoner
was
all
eyes
and
ears
in
this
moment
of
waiting
and
from
an
involuntary
gesture
on
the
part
of
the
judge
he
divined
that
they
were
speaking
of
him
it
is
a
pity
he
could
not
hear
what
was
said
how
do
you
feel
about
the
case
colonel
asked
the
judge
let
him
off
easy
replied
colonel
thornton
he
the
best
blacksmith
in
the
county
the
business
of
the
court
seemed
to
have
halted
by
tacit
consent
in
anticipation
of
a
quick
verdict
the
suspense
did
not
last
long
scarcely
ten
minutes
had
elapsed
when
there
was
a
rap
on
the
door
the
officer
opened
it
and
the
jury
came
out
the
prisoner
his
soul
in
his
eyes
sought
their
faces
but
met
no
reassuring
glance
they
were
all
looking
away
from
him
gentlemen
of
the
jury
have
you
agreed
upon
a
verdict
we
have
responded
the
foreman
the
clerk
of
the
court
stepped
forward
and
took
the
fateful
slip
from
the
foreman
hand
the
clerk
read
the
verdict
we
the
jury
impaneled
and
sworn
to
try
the
issues
in
this
cause
do
find
the
prisoner
guilty
as
charged
in
the
indictment
there
was
a
moment
of
breathless
silence
then
a
wild
burst
of
grief
from
the
prisoner
wife
to
which
his
two
children
not
understanding
it
all
but
vaguely
conscious
of
some
calamity
added
their
voices
in
two
long
discordant
wails
which
would
have
been
ludicrous
had
they
not
been
heartrending
the
face
of
the
young
man
in
the
back
of
the
room
expressed
relief
and
badly
concealed
satisfaction
the
prisoner
fell
back
upon
the
seat
from
which
he
had
half
risen
in
his
anxiety
and
his
dark
face
assumed
an
ashen
hue
what
he
thought
could
only
be
surmised
perhaps
knowing
his
innocence
he
had
not
believed
conviction
possible
perhaps
conscious
of
guilt
he
dreaded
the
punishment
the
extent
of
which
was
optional
with
the
judge
within
very
wide
limits
only
one
other
person
present
knew
whether
or
not
he
was
guilty
and
that
other
had
slunk
furtively
from
the
court
room
some
of
the
spectators
wondered
why
there
should
be
so
much
ado
about
convicting
a
negro
of
stealing
a
they
had
forgotten
their
own
interest
of
the
moment
before
they
did
not
realize
out
of
what
trifles
grow
the
tragedies
of
life
it
was
four
in
the
afternoon
the
hour
for
adjournment
when
the
verdict
was
returned
the
judge
nodded
to
the
bailiff
oyez
oyez
this
court
is
now
adjourned
until
ten
morning
cried
the
bailiff
in
a
singsong
voice
the
judge
left
the
bench
the
jury
filed
out
of
the
box
and
a
buzz
of
conversation
filled
the
court
room
brace
up
ben
brace
up
my
boy
said
the
defendant
lawyer
half
apologetically
i
did
what
i
could
for
you
but
you
can
never
tell
what
a
jury
will
do
you
wo
be
sentenced
till
morning
in
the
meantime
i
speak
to
the
judge
and
try
to
get
him
to
be
easy
with
you
he
may
let
you
off
with
a
light
fine
the
negro
pulled
himself
together
and
by
an
effort
listened
thanky
majah
was
all
he
said
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
something
far
away
he
barely
spoke
to
his
wife
when
she
frantically
threw
herself
on
him
and
clung
to
his
neck
as
he
passed
through
the
side
room
on
his
way
to
jail
he
kissed
his
children
mechanically
and
did
not
reply
to
the
soothing
remarks
made
by
the
jailer
iii
there
was
a
good
deal
of
excitement
in
town
the
next
morning
two
white
men
stood
by
the
post
office
talking
did
yer
hear
the
news
no
what
wuz
it
ben
davis
tried
ter
break
jail
las
night
you
do
say
so
what
a
fool
he
ai
sentenced
yit
well
now
said
the
other
i
knowed
ben
a
long
time
an
he
wuz
a
right
good
nigger
i
kinder
found
it
hard
ter
he
did
steal
that
whip
but
what
a
man
feelin
the
proof
they
spoke
on
awhile
using
the
past
tense
as
if
they
were
speaking
of
a
dead
man
ef
i
know
jedge
hart
ben
wish
he
had
slep
las
night
tryin
ter
break
jail
at
ten
the
prisoner
was
brought
into
court
he
walked
with
shambling
gait
bent
at
the
shoulders
hopelessly
with
downcast
eyes
and
took
his
seat
with
several
other
prisoners
who
had
been
brought
in
for
sentence
his
wife
accompanied
by
the
children
waited
behind
him
and
a
number
of
his
friends
were
gathered
in
the
court
room
the
first
prisoner
sentenced
was
a
young
white
man
convicted
several
days
before
of
manslaughter
the
deed
was
done
in
the
heat
of
passion
under
circumstances
of
great
provocation
during
a
quarrel
about
a
woman
the
prisoner
was
admonished
of
the
sanctity
of
human
life
and
sentenced
to
one
year
in
the
penitentiary
the
next
case
was
that
of
a
young
clerk
eighteen
or
nineteen
years
of
age
who
had
committed
a
forgery
in
order
to
procure
the
means
to
buy
lottery
tickets
he
was
well
connected
and
the
case
would
not
have
been
prosecuted
if
the
judge
had
not
refused
to
allow
it
to
be
nolled
and
once
brought
to
trial
a
conviction
could
not
have
been
avoided
you
are
a
young
man
said
the
judge
gravely
yet
not
unkindly
and
your
life
is
yet
before
you
i
regret
that
you
should
have
been
led
into
evil
courses
by
the
lust
for
speculation
so
dangerous
in
its
tendencies
so
fruitful
of
crime
and
misery
i
am
led
to
believe
that
you
are
sincerely
penitent
and
that
after
such
punishment
as
the
law
can
not
remit
without
bringing
itself
into
contempt
you
will
see
the
error
of
your
ways
and
follow
the
strict
path
of
rectitude
your
fault
has
entailed
distress
not
only
upon
yourself
but
upon
your
relatives
people
of
good
name
and
good
family
who
suffer
as
keenly
from
your
disgrace
as
you
yourself
partly
out
of
consideration
for
their
feelings
and
partly
because
i
feel
that
under
the
circumstances
the
law
will
be
satisfied
by
the
penalty
i
shall
inflict
i
sentence
you
to
imprisonment
in
the
county
jail
for
six
months
and
a
fine
of
one
hundred
dollars

the

he
might
have
said
ben
davis
wake
up
for
the
jailer
had
to
touch
the
prisoner
on
the
shoulder
to
rouse
him
from
his
stupor
he
stood
up
and
something
of
the
hunted
look
came
again
into
his
eyes
which
shifted
under
the
stern
glance
of
the
judge
ben
davis
you
have
been
convicted
of
larceny
after
a
fair
trial
before
twelve
good
men
of
this
county
under
the
testimony
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
your
guilt
the
case
is
an
aggravated
one
you
are
not
an
ignorant
shiftless
fellow
but
a
man
of
more
than
ordinary
intelligence
among
your
people
and
one
who
ought
to
know
better
you
have
not
even
the
poor
excuse
of
having
stolen
to
satisfy
hunger
or
a
physical
appetite
your
conduct
is
wholly
without
excuse
and
i
can
only
regard
your
crime
as
the
result
of
a
tendency
to
offenses
of
this
nature
a
tendency
which
is
only
too
common
among
your
people
a
tendency
which
is
a
menace
to
civilization
a
menace
to
society
itself
for
society
rests
upon
the
sacred
right
of
property
your
opinions
too
have
been
given
a
wrong
turn
you
have
been
heard
to
utter
sentiments
which
if
disseminated
among
an
ignorant
people
would
breed
discontent
and
give
rise
to
strained
relations
between
them
and
their
best
friends
their
old
masters
who
understand
their
real
nature
and
their
real
needs
and
to
whose
justice
and
enlightened
guidance
they
can
safely
trust
have
you
anything
to
say
why
sentence
should
not
be
passed
upon
you
nothin
suh
dat
i
did
n
take
de
whip
the
law
largely
i
think
in
view
of
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
your
unfortunate
race
has
vested
a
large
discretion
in
courts
as
to
the
extent
of
the
punishment
for
offenses
of
this
kind
taking
your
case
as
a
whole
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
one
which
for
the
sake
of
the
example
deserves
a
severe
punishment
nevertheless
i
do
not
feel
disposed
to
give
you
the
full
extent
of
the
law
which
would
be
twenty
years
in
the
penitentiary
but
considering
the
fact
that
you
have
a
family
and
have
heretofore
borne
a
good
reputation
in
the
community
i
will
impose
upon
you
the
light
sentence
of
imprisonment
for
five
years
in
the
penitentiary
at
hard
labor
and
i
hope
that
this
will
be
a
warning
to
you
and
others
who
may
be
similarly
disposed
and
that
after
your
sentence
has
expired
you
may
lead
the
life
of
a
citizen

were
looking

of

and

acquired
in

anxiety

spoke

nineteenth

civilization
with
which
ben
davis
had
been
more
or
less
closely
in
touch
during
twenty
years
of
slavery
and
fifteen
years
of
freedom
in
the
stolidity
with
which
he
received
this
sentence
for
a
crime
which
he
had
not

iv
one
morning
in
june
five
years
later
a
black
man
limped
slowly
along
the
old
lumberton
plank
road
a
tall
man
whose
bowed
shoulders
made
him
seem
shorter
than
he
was
and
a
face
from
which
it
was
difficult
to
guess
his
years
for
in
it
the
wrinkles
and
flabbiness
of
age
were
found
side
by
side
with
firm
white
teeth
and
eyes
not
sunken
eyes
bloodshot
and
burning
with
something
either
fever
or
passion
though
he
limped
painfully
with
one
foot
the
other
hit
the
ground
impatiently
like
the
good
horse
in
a
poorly
matched
team
as
he
walked
along
he
was
talking
to
himself

an
five
minutes
later
a
face
peered
cautiously
into
the
window
of
what
had
once
been
ben
davis
cabin
at
first
an
eager
face
its
coarseness
lit
up
with
the
fire
of
hope
a
moment
later
a
puzzled
face
then
an
anxious
fearful
face
as
the
man
stepped
away
from
the
window
and
rapped
at
the
door

back
the

sleepy
accents
from
the
man
seated
by

fireplace
the
traveler
went
on
to
the

house
a

woman
came
to
the
door
when
he
rattled
the

and
stood
looking
suspiciously
at
him

the
man
with
the
bundle
went
on
until
he
came
to
a
creek
that
crossed
the
road
he
descended
the
sloping
bank
and
sitting
on
a
stone
in
the
shade
of
a
took
off
his
coarse
brogans
unwound
the
rags
that
served
him
in
lieu
of
stockings
and
laved
in
the
cool
water
the
feet
that
were
chafed
with
many
a
weary
mile
of
travel
after
five
years
of
unrequited
toil
and
unspeakable
hardship
in
convict
camps
five
years
of
slaving
by
the
side
of
human
brutes
and
of
nightly
herding
with
them
in
huts
ben
davis
had
become
like
them
for
a
while
he
had
received
occasional
letters
from
home
but
in
the
shifting
life
of
the
convict
camp
they
had
long
since
ceased
to
reach
him
if
indeed
they
had
been
written
for
a
year
or
two
the
consciousness
of
his
innocence
had
helped
to
make
him
resist
the
debasing
influences
that
surrounded
him
the
hope
of
shortening
his
sentence
by
good
behavior
too
had
worked
a
similar
end
but
the
transfer
from
one
contractor
to
another
each
interested
in
keeping
as
long
as
possible
a
good
worker
had
speedily
dissipated
any
such
hope
when
hope
took
flight
its
place
was
not
long
vacant
despair
followed
and
black
hatred
of
all
mankind
hatred
especially
of
the
man
to
whom
he
attributed
all
his
misfortunes
one
who
is
suffering
unjustly
is
not
apt
to
indulge
in
fine
abstractions
nor
to
balance
probabilities
by
long
brooding
over
his
wrongs
his
mind
became
if
not
unsettled
at
least
warped
and
he
imagined
that
colonel
thornton
had
deliberately
set
a
trap
into
which
he
had
fallen
the
colonel
he
convinced
himself
had
disapproved
of
his
prosperity
and
had
schemed
to
destroy
it
he
reasoned
himself
into
the
belief
that
he
represented
in
his
person
the
accumulated
wrongs
of
a
whole
race
and
colonel
thornton
the
race
who
had
oppressed
them
a
burning
desire
for
revenge
sprang
up
in
him
and
he
nursed
it
until
his
sentence
expired
and
he
was
set
at
liberty
what
he
had
learned
since
reaching
home
had
changed
his
desire
into
a
deadly
purpose
when
he
had
again
bandaged
his
feet
and
slipped
them
into
his
shoes
he
looked
around
him
and
selected
a
stout
sapling
from
among
the
undergrowth
that
covered
the
bank
of
the
stream
taking
from
his
pocket
a
huge
he
cut
off
the
length
of
an
ordinary
walking
stick
and
trimmed
it
the
result
was
an
bludgeon
a
dangerous
weapon
when
in
the
grasp
of
a
strong
man
with
the
stick
in
his
hand
he
went
on
down
the
road
until
he
approached
a
large
white
house
standing
some
distance
back
from
the
street
the
grounds
were
filled
with
a
profusion
of
shrubbery
the
negro
entered
the
gate
and
secreted
himself
in
the
bushes
at
a
point
where
he
could
hear
any
one
that
might
approach
it
was
near
midday
and
he
had
not
eaten
he
had
walked
all
night
and
had
not
slept
the
hope
of
meeting
his
loved
ones
had
been
meat
and
drink
and
rest
for
him
but
as
he
sat
waiting
outraged
nature
asserted
itself
and
he
fell
asleep
with
his
head
on
the
rising
root
of
a
tree
and
his
face
upturned
and
as
he
slept
he
dreamed
of
his
childhood
of
an
old
black
mammy
taking
care
of
him
in
the
daytime
and
of
a
younger
face
with
soft
eyes
which
bent
over
him
sometimes
at
night
and
a
pair
of
arms
which
clasped
him
closely
he
dreamed
of
his
past
of
his
young
wife
of
his
bright
children
somehow
his
dreams
all
ran
to
pleasant
themes
for
a
while
then
they
changed
again
he
dreamed
that
he
was
in
the
convict
camp
and
by
an
easy
transition
that
he
was
in
hell
consumed
with
hunger
burning
with
thirst
suddenly
the
grinning
devil
who
stood
over
him
with
a
barbed
whip
faded
away
and
a
little
white
angel
came
and
handed
him
a
drink
of
water
as
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
the
glass
slipped
and
he
struggled
back
to
consciousness

some

a
sweet
little
child
as
beautiful
as
a
cherub
escaped
from
paradise
was
standing
over
him
at
first
he
scarcely
comprehended
the
words
the
baby
babbled
out
but
as
they
became
clear
to
him
a
novel
feeling
crept
slowly
over
his
heart
it
had
been
so
long
since
he
had
heard
anything
but
curses
and
stern
words
of
command
or
the
ribald
songs
of
obscene
merriment
that
the
clear
tones
of
this
voice
from
heaven
cooled
his
calloused
heart
as
the
water
of
the
brook
had
soothed
his
blistered
feet
it
was
so
strange
so
unwonted
a
thing
that
he
lay
there
with
eyes
while
the
child
brought
leaves
and
flowers
and
laid
them
on
his
face
and
on
his
breast
and
arranged
them
with
little
caressing
taps
she
moved
away
and
plucked
a
flower
and
then
she
spied
another
farther
on
and
then
another
and
as
she
gathered
them
kept
increasing
the
distance
between
herself
and
the
man
lying
there
until
she
was
several
rods
away
ben
davis
watched
her
through
eyes
over
which
had
come
an
unfamiliar
softness
under
the
lingering
spell
of
his
dream
her
golden
hair
which
fell
in
rippling
curls
seemed
like
a
halo
of
purity
and
innocence
and
peace
irradiating
the
atmosphere
around
her
it
is
true
the
thought
occurred
to
ben
vaguely
that
through
harm
to
her
he
might
inflict
the
greatest
punishment
upon
her
father
but
the
idea
came
like
a
dark
shape
that
faded
away
and
vanished
into
nothingness
as
soon
as
it
came
within
the
nimbus
that
surrounded
the
child
person
the
child
was
moving
on
to
pluck
still
another
flower
when
there
came
a
sound
of
and
ben
was
aware
that
a
horseman
visible
through
the
shrubbery
was
coming
along
the
curved
path
that
led
from
the
gate
to
the
house
it
must
be
the
man
he
was
waiting
for
and
now
was
the
time
to
wreak
his
vengeance
he
sprang
to
his
feet
grasped
his
club
and
stood
for
a
moment
irresolute
but
either
the
instinct
of
the
convict
beaten
driven
and
debased
or
the
influence
of
the
child
which
was
still
strong
upon
him
impelled
him
after
the
first
momentary
pause
to
flee
as
though
seeking
safety
his
flight
led
him
toward
the
little
girl
whom
he
must
pass
in
order
to
make
his
escape
and
as
colonel
thornton
turned
the
corner
of
the
path
he
saw
a
negro
clad
in
filthy
rags
and
carrying
in
his
hand
a
murderous
bludgeon
running
toward
the
child
who
startled
by
the
sound
of
footsteps
had
turned
and
was
looking
toward
the
approaching
man
with
wondering
eyes
a
sickening
fear
came
over
the
father
heart
and
drawing
the
revolver
which
according
to
the
southern
custom
he
carried
always
upon
his
person
he
fired
with
unerring
aim
ben
davis
ran
a
few
yards
farther
faltered
threw
out
his
hands
and
fell
dead
at
the
child
feet
some
time
we
are
told
when
the
cycle
of
years
has
rolled
around
there
is
to
be
another
golden
age
when
all
men
will
dwell
together
in
love
and
harmony

and

shall
prevail

thousand
years

not
the

thread

become
so
enmeshed
in
the
web
of
circumstance
that
we
lose
sight
of
it
but
give
us
here
and
there
and
now
and
then
some
little
foretaste
of
this
golden
age
that
we
may

more
patiently
and
hopefully
await

what

the

gone
forth
from
the
wise

of

who

his

to

in

it
is
of
course
perfectly
obvious
that
the
writer
or
speaker
who
used
this
expression
perhaps
grady
of

did
not
say
what
he
meant
it
is
not

that
he
meant

and
teutons
and
gauls
and
slavs
who
make
up
so
large
a
proportion
of
our
population
he
hardly
meant
to
exclude
the
jews
for
even
the
most
ardent
would
hardly
venture
to
advocate
the
disfranchisement
of
the
thrifty
race
whose
mortgages
cover
so
large
a
portion
of
southern
soil
what
the
eloquent
gentleman
really
meant
by
this
phrase
was
simply
the
white
race
and
the
substance
of
the
argument
of
that
school
of
southern
writers
to
which
he
belongs
is
simply
that
for
the
good
of
the
country
the
negro
should
have
no
voice
in
directing
the
government
or
public
policy
of
the
southern
states
or
of
the
nation
but
it
is
evident
that
where
the
intermingling
of
the
races
has
made
such
progress
as
it
has
in
this
country
the
line
which
separates
the
races
must
in
many
instances
have
been
practically
obliterated
and
there
has
arisen
in
the
united
states
a
very
large
class
of
the
population
who
are
certainly
not
negroes
in
an
ethnological
sense
and
whose
children
will
be
no
nearer
negroes
than
themselves
in
view
therefore
of
the
very
positive
ground
taken
by
the
white
leaders
of
the
south
where
most
of
these
people
reside
it
becomes
in
the
highest
degree
important
to
them
to
know
what
race
they
belong
to
it
ought
to
be
also
a
matter
of
serious
concern
to
the
southern
white
people
for
if
their
zeal
for
good
government
is
so
great
that
they
contemplate
the
practical
overthrow
of
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
to
secure
it
they
ought
at
least
to
be
sure
that
no
man
entitled
to
it
by
their
own
argument
is
robbed
of
a
right
so
precious
as
that
of
free
citizenship
the
all
conquering
ought
to
set
as
high
a
value
on
american
citizenship
as
the
roman
placed
upon
the
franchise
of
his
state
two
thousand
years
ago
this
discussion
would
of
course
be
of
little
interest
to
the
genuine
negro
who
is
entirely
outside
of
the
charmed
circle
and
must
content
himself
with
the
acquisition
of
wealth
the
pursuit
of
learning
and
such
other
privileges
as
his
best
friends
may
find
it
consistent
with
the
welfare
of
the
nation
to
allow
him
but
to
every
other
good
citizen
the
inquiry
ought
to
be
a
momentous
one
what
is
a
white
man
in
spite
of
the
virulence
and
universality
of
race
prejudice
in
the
united
states
the
human
intellect
long
ago
revolted
at
the
manifest
absurdity
of
classifying
men
white
as
black
men
and
hence
there
grew
up
a
number
of
laws
in
different
states
of
the
union
defining
the
limit
which
separated
the
white
and
colored
races
which
was
when
these
laws
took
their
rise
and
is
now
to
a
large
extent
the
line
which
separated
freedom
and
opportunity
from
slavery
or
hopeless
degradation
some
of
these
laws
are
of
legislative
origin
others
are
laws
brought
out
by
the
exigencies
of
special
cases
which
came
before
the
courts
for
determination
some
day
they
will
perhaps
become
mere
curiosities
of
jurisprudence
the
black
laws
will
be
bracketed
with
the
blue
laws
and
will
be
at
best
but
landmarks
by
which
to
measure
the
progress
of
the
nation
but
these
laws
are
in
active
operation
and
they
are
therefore
worthy
of
attention
for
every
good
citizen
ought
to
know
the
law
and
if
possible
to
respect
it
and
if
not
worthy
of
respect
it
should
be
changed
by
the
authority
which
enacted
it
whether
any
of
the
laws
referred
to
here
have
been
in
any
manner
changed
by
very
recent
legislation
the
writer
can
not
say
but
they
are
certainly
embodied
in
the
latest
editions
of
the
revised
statutes
of
the
states
referred
to
the
colored
people
were
divided
in
most
of
the
southern
states
into
two
classes
designated
by
law
as
negroes
and
mulattoes
respectively
the
term
negro
was
used
in
its
ethnological
sense
and
needed
no
definition
but
the
term
mulatto
was
held
by
legislative
enactment
to
embrace
all
persons
of
color
not
negroes
the
words
quadroon
and
mestizo
are
employed
in
some
of
the
law
books
tho
not
defined
but
the
term
octoroon
as
indicating
a
person
having
of
negro
blood
is
not
used
at
all
so
far
as
the
writer
has
been
able
to
observe
the
states
vary
slightly
in
regard
to
what
constitutes
a
mulatto
or
person
of
color
and
as
to
what
proportion
of
white
blood
should
be
sufficient
to
remove
the
disability
of
color
as
a
general
rule
less
than
of
negro
blood
left
the
individual
white
in
theory
race
questions
being
however
regulated
very
differently
in
practice
in
missouri
by
the
code
of
still
in
operation
so
far
as
not
inconsistent
with
the
federal
constitution
and
laws
any
person
other
than
a
negro
any
one
of
whose
grandmothers
or
grandfathers
is
or
shall
have
been
a
negro
tho
all
of
his
or
her
progenitors
except
those
descended
from
the
negro
may
have
been
white
persons
shall
be
deemed
a
mulatto
thus
the
is
drawn
at
of
negro
blood
and
persons
with
only
are
white
by
the
mississippi
code
of
the
is
drawn
at
of
negro
blood
all
persons
having
less
being
theoretically
white
under
the
of
louisiana
the
descendant
of
a
white
and
a
quadroon
is
white
thus
drawing
the
line
at
of
negro
blood
the
code
of
abolished
all
distinctions
of
color
as
to
whether
they
have
been
since
the
republican
party
went
out
of
power
in
that
state
the
writer
is
not
informed
jumping
to
the
extreme
north
persons
are
white
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
of
michigan
who
have
less
than
of
negro
blood
in
ohio
the
rule
as
established
by
numerous
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
was
that
a
preponderance
of
white
blood
constituted
a
person
a
white
man
in
the
eye
of
the
law
and
entitled
him
to
the
exercise
of
all
the
civil
rights
of
a
white
man
by
a
retrogressive
step
the
was
extended
in
in
the
case
of
marriage
which
by
statute
was
forbidden
between
a
person
of
pure
white
blood
and
one
having
a
visible
admixture
of
african
blood
but
by
act
of
legislature
passed
in
the
spring
of
all
laws
establishing
or
permitting
distinctions
of
color
were
repealed
in
many
parts
of
the
state
these
laws
were
always
ignored
and
they
would
doubtless
have
been
repealed
long
ago
but
for
the
sentiment
of
the
southern
counties
separated
only
by
the
width
of
the
ohio
river
from
a
former
state
there
was
a
bill
introduced
in
the
legislature
during
the
last
session
to
the
black
laws
but
it
was
hopelessly
defeated
the
member
who
introduced
it
evidently
mistook
his
latitude
he
ought
to
be
a
member
of
the
georgia
legislature
but
the
state
which
for
several
reasons
one
might
expect
to
have
the
strictest
laws
in
regard
to
the
relations
of
the
races
has
really
the
loosest
two
extracts
from
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
will
make
clear
the
law
of
that
state
in
regard
to
the
color
line
the
definition
of
the
term
mulatto
as
understood
in
this
state
seems
to
be
vague
signifying
generally
a
person
of
mixed
white
or
european
and
negro
parentage
in
whatever
proportions
the
blood
of
the
two
races
may
be
mingled
in
the
individual
but
it
is
not
invariably
applicable
to
every
admixture
of
african
blood
with
the
european
nor
is
one
having
all
the
features
of
a
white
to
be
ranked
with
the
degraded
class
designated
by
the
laws
of
this
state
as
persons
of
color
because
of
some
remote
taint
of
the
negro
race
the
line
of
distinction
however
is
not
ascertained
by
any
rule
of
law
juries
would
probably
be
justified
in
holding
a
person
to
be
white
in
whom
the
admixture
of
african
blood
did
not
exceed
the
proportion
of
but
it
is
in
all
cases
a
question
for
the
jury
to
be
determined
by
them
upon
the
evidence
of
features
and
complexion
afforded
by
inspection
the
evidence
of
reputation
as
to
parentage
and
the
evidence
of
the
rank
and
station
in
society
occupied
by
the
party
the
only
rule
which
can
be
laid
down
by
the
courts
is
that
where
there
is
a
distinct
and
visible
admixture
of
negro
blood
the
individual
is
to
be
denominated
a
mulatto
or
person
of
color
in
a
later
case
the
court
held
the
question
whether
persons
are
colored
or
white
where
color
or
feature
are
doubtful
is
for
the
jury
to
decide
by
reputation
by
reception
into
society
and
by
their
exercise
of
the
privileges
of
the
white
man
as
well
as
by
admixture
of
blood
it
is
an
interesting
question
why
such
should
have
been
and
should
still
be
for
that
matter
the
law
of
south
carolina
and
why
there
should
exist
in
that
state
a
condition
of
public
opinion
which
would
accept
such
a
law
perhaps
it
may
be
attributed
to
the
fact
that
the
colored
population
of
south
carolina
always
outnumbered
the
white
population
and
the
eagerness
of
the
latter
to
recruit
their
ranks
was
sufficient
to
overcome
in
some
measure
their
prejudice
against
the
negro
blood
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
is
in
practice
as
in
law
more
loosely
drawn
in
south
carolina
than
in
any
other
southern
state
and
that
no
inconsiderable
element
of
the
population
of
that
state
consists
of
these
legal
white
persons
who
were
either
born
in
the
state
or
attracted
thither
by
this
feature
of
the
laws
have
come
in
from
surrounding
states
and
forsaking
home
and
kindred
have
taken
their
social
position
as
white
people
a
reasonable
degree
of
reticence
in
regard
to
one
antecedents
is
however
usual
in
such
cases
before
the
war
the
as
fixed
by
law
regulated
in
theory
the
civil
and
political
status
of
persons
of
color
what
that
status
was
was
expressed
in
the
dred
scott
decision
but
since
the
war
or
rather
since
the
enfranchisement
of
the
colored
people
these
laws
have
been
mainly
confined
in
theory
be
it
always
remembered
to
the
regulation
of
the
intercourse
of
the
races
in
schools
and
in
the
marriage
relation
the
extension
of
the
to
places
of
public
entertainment
and
resort
to
inns
and
public
highways
is
in
most
states
entirely
a
matter
of
custom
a
colored
man
can
sue
in
the
courts
of
any
southern
state
for
the
violation
of
his
rights
and
recover
damages
of
say
fifty
cents
without
costs
a
colored
minister
who
sued
a
baltimore
steamboat
company
a
few
weeks
ago
for
refusing
him
accommodation
he
having
paid
fare
did
not
even
meet
with
that
measure
of
success
the
learned
judge
a
federal
judge
by
the
way
held
that
the
plaintiff
rights
had
been
invaded
and
that
he
had
suffered
humiliation
at
the
hands
of
the
defendant
company
but
that
the
humiliation
was
not
sufficient
to
entitle
him
to
damages
and
the
learned
judge
dismissed
the
action
without
costs
to
either
party
having
thus
ascertained
what
constitutes
a
white
man
the
good
citizen
may
be
curious
to
know
what
steps
have
been
taken
to
preserve
the
purity
of
the
white
race
nature
by
some
unaccountable
oversight
having
to
some
extent
neglected
a
matter
so
important
to
the
future
prosperity
and
progress
of
mankind
the
marriage
laws
referred
to
here
are
in
active
operation
and
cases
under
them
are
by
no
means
infrequent
indeed
instead
of
being
behind
the
age
the
marriage
laws
in
the
southern
states
are
in
advance
of
public
opinion
for
very
rarely
will
a
southern
community
stop
to
figure
on
the
pedigree
of
the
contracting
parties
to
a
marriage
where
one
is
white
and
the
other
is
known
to
have
any
strain
of
negro
blood
in
virginia
under
the
title
offenses
against
morality
the
law
provides
that
any
white
person
who
shall
intermarry
with
a
negro
shall
be
confined
in
jail
not
more
than
one
year
and
fined
not
exceeding
one
hundred
dollars
in
a
marginal
note
on
the
attention
is
called
to
the
fact
that
a
similar
penalty
is
not
imposed
on
the
negro
a
stretch
of
magnanimity
to
which
the
laws
of
other
states
are
strangers
a
person
who
performs
the
ceremony
of
marriage
in
such
a
case
is
fined
two
hundred
dollars
of
which
goes
to
the
informer
in
maryland
a
minister
who
performs
the
ceremony
of
marriage
between
a
negro
and
a
white
person
is
liable
to
a
fine
of
one
hundred
dollars
in
mississippi
code
of
it
is
provided
that
the
marriage
of
a
white
person
to
a
negro
or
mulatto
or
person
who
shall
have
or
more
of
negro
blood
shall
be
unlawful
and
as
this
prohibition
does
not
seem
sufficiently
emphatic
it
is
further
declared
to
be
incestuous
and
void
and
is
punished
by
the
same
penalty
prescribed
for
marriage
within
the
forbidden
degrees
of
consanguinity
but
it
is
georgia
the
of
the
which
merits
the
questionable
distinction
of
having
the
harshest
set
of
color
laws
by
the
law
of
georgia
the
term
person
of
color
is
defined
to
mean
all
such
as
have
an
admixture
of
negro
blood
and
the
term
includes
mulattoes
this
definition
is
perhaps
restricted
somewhat
by
another
provision
by
which
all
negroes
mestizoes
and
their
descendants
having
of
negro
or
mulatto
blood
in
their
veins
shall
be
known
in
this
state
as
persons
of
color
a
colored
minister
is
permitted
to
perform
the
ceremony
of
marriage
between
colored
persons
only
tho
white
ministers
are
not
forbidden
to
join
persons
of
color
in
wedlock
it
is
further
provided
that
the
marriage
relation
between
white
persons
and
persons
of
african
descent
is
forever
prohibited
and
such
marriages
shall
be
null
and
void
this
is
a
very
sweeping
provision
it
will
be
noticed
that
the
term
persons
of
color
previously
defined
is
not
employed
the
expression
persons
of
african
descent
being
used
instead
a
court
which
was
so
inclined
would
find
no
difficulty
in
extending
this
provision
of
the
law
to
the
remotest
strain
of
african
blood
the
marriage
relation
is
forever
prohibited
forever
is
a
long
time
there
is
a
colored
woman
in
georgia
said
to
be
worth
an
immense
fortune
in
the
poverty
stricken
south
with
a
few
hundred
such
women
in
that
state
possessing
a
fair
degree
of
good
looks
the
would
shrivel
up
like
a
scroll
in
the
heat
of
competition
for
their
hands
in
marriage
the
penalty
for
the
violation
of
the
law
against
intermarriage
is
the
same
sought
to
be
imposed
by
the
defunct
glenn
bill
for
violation
of
its
provisions
a
fine
not
to
exceed
one
thousand
dollars
and
imprisonment
not
to
exceed
six
months
or
twelve
months
in
the
whatever
the
wisdom
or
justice
of
these
laws
there
is
one
objection
to
them
which
is
not
given
sufficient
prominence
in
the
consideration
of
the
subject
even
where
it
is
discussed
at
all
they
make
mixed
blood
a
proof
of
illegitimacy
it
is
a
fact
that
at
present
in
the
united
states
a
colored
man
or
woman
whose
complexion
is
white
or
nearly
white
is
presumed
in
the
absence
of
any
knowledge
of
his
or
her
antecedents
to
be
the
offspring
of
a
union
not
sanctified
by
law
and
by
a
curious
but
not
uncommon
process
such
persons
are
not
held
in
the
same
low
estimation
as
white
people
in
the
same
position
the
sins
of
their
fathers
are
not
visited
upon
the
children
in
that
regard
at
least
and
their
mothers
lapses
from
virtue
are
regarded
either
as
misfortunes
or
as
faults
excusable
under
the
circumstances
but
in
spite
of
all
this
illegitimacy
is
not
a
desirable
distinction
and
is
likely
to
become
less
so
as
these
people
of
mixed
blood
advance
in
wealth
and
social
standing
this
presumption
of
illegitimacy
was
once
perhaps
true
of
the
majority
of
such
persons
but
the
times
have
changed
more
than
half
of
the
colored
people
of
the
united
states
are
of
mixed
blood
they
marry
and
are
given
in
marriage
and
they
beget
children
of
complexions
similar
to
their
own
whether
or
not
therefore
laws
which
stamp
these
children
as
illegitimate
and
which
by
indirection
establish
a
lower
standard
of
morality
for
a
large
part
of
the
population

remaining
part
is

and
whether
or
not
the
purity
of
the
white
race
could
not
be
as
well
preserved
by
the
exercise
of
virtue
and
the
operation
of
those
natural
laws
which
are
so
often
quoted
by
southern
writers
as
the
justification
of
all
sorts
of
southern
policies
are
questions
which
the
good
citizen
may
at
least
turn
over
in
his
mind
occasionally
pending
the
settlement
of
other
complications
which
have
grown
out
of
the
presence
of
the
negro
on

may
the

american
what
the
race
is
likely
to
become
in
the
process
of
time
the
future
american
race
is
a
popular
theme
for
essayists
and
has
been
much
discussed
most
expressions
upon
the
subject
however
have
been
characterized
by
a
conscious
or
unconscious
evasion
of
some
of
the
main
elements
of
the
problem
involved
in
the
formation
of
a
future
american
race
or
to
put
it
perhaps
more
correctly
a
future
ethnic
type
that
shall
inhabit
the
northern
part
of
the
western
continent
some
of
these
obvious
omissions
will
be
touched
upon
in
these
articles
and
if
the
writer
has
any
preconceived
opinions
that
would
affect
his
judgment
they
are
at
least
not
the
hackneyed
prejudices
of
the
past
if
they
lead
to
false
conclusions
they
at
least
furnish
a
new
point
of
view
from
which
taken
with
other
widely
differing
views
the
judicious
reader
may
establish
a
parallax
that
will
enable
him
to
approximate
the
truth
the
popular
theory
is
that
the
future
american
race
will
consist
of
a
harmonious
fusion
of
the
various
european
elements
which
now
make
up
our
heterogeneous
population
the
result
is
to
be
something
infinitely
superior
to
the
best
of
the
component
elements
this
perfection
of
type
no
good
american
could
for
a
moment
doubt
that
it
will
be
as
perfect
as
everything
else
american
is
to
be
brought
about
by
a
combination
of
all
the
best
characteristics
of
the
different
european
races
and
the
elimination
by
some
strange
alchemy
of
all
their
undesirable
traits
for
even
a
good
american
will
admit
that
european
races
now
and
then
have
some
undesirable
traits
when
they
first
come
over
it
is
a
beautiful
a
hopeful
and
to
the
eye
of
faith
a
thrilling
prospect
the
defect
of
the
argument
however
lies
in
the
incompleteness
of
the
premises
and
its
obliviousness
of
certain
facts
of
human
nature
and
human
history
before
putting
forward
any
theory
upon
the
subject
it
may
be
well
enough
to
remark
that
recent
scientific
research
has
swept
away
many
hoary
anthropological
fallacies
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
the
shape
or
size
of
the
head
has
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
the
civilization
or
average
intelligence
of
a
race
that
language
so
recently
lauded
as
an
infallible
test
of
racial
origin
is
of
absolutely
no
value
in
this
connection
its
distribution
being
dependent
upon
other
conditions
than
race
even
color
upon
which
the
social
structure
of
the
united
states
is
so
largely
based
has
been
proved
no
test
of
race
the
conception
of
a
pure
aryan
race
has
been
abandoned
in
scientific
circles
and
the
secret
of
the
progress
of
europe
has
been
found
in
racial
heterogeneity
rather
than
in
racial
purity
the
theory
that
the
jews
are
a
pure
race
has
been
exploded
and
their
peculiar
type
explained
upon
a
different
and
much
more
satisfactory
hypothesis
to
illustrate
the
change
of
opinion
and
the
growth
of
liberality
in
scientific
circles
imagine
the
reception
which
would
have
been
accorded
to
this
proposition
if
laid
down
by
an
american
writer
fifty
or
sixty
years
ago
the
european
races
as
a
whole
show
signs
of
a
secondary
or
derived
origin
certain
characteristics
especially
the
texture
of
the
hair
lead
us
to
class
them
as
intermediate
between
the
extreme
primary
types
of
the
asiatic
and
negro
races
respectively
this
is
put
forward
by
the
author
not
as
a
mere
hypothesis
but
as
a
proposition
fairly
susceptible
of
proof
and
is
supported
by
an
elaborate
argument
based
upon
microscopical
comparisons
to
which
numerous
authorities
are
cited
if
this
fact
be
borne
in
mind
it
will
simplify
in
some
degree
our
conception
of
a
future
american
ethnic
type
by
modern
research
the
unity
of
the
human
race
has
been
proved
if
it
needed
any
proof
to
the
careful
or
observer
and
the
differentiation
of
races
by
selection
and
environment
has
been
so
stated
as
to
prove
itself
greater
emphasis
has
been
placed
upon
environment
as
a
factor
in
ethnic
development
and
what
has
been
called
the
vulgar
theory
of
race
as
accounting
for
progress
and
culture
has
been
relegated
to
the
limbo
of
exploded
dogmas
one
of
the
most
perspicuous
and
forceful
presentations
of
these
modern
conclusions
of
anthropology
is
found
in
the
volume
above
quoted
a
book
which
owes
its
origin
to
a
boston
scholar
proceeding
then
upon
the
firm
basis
laid
down
by
science
and
the
historic
parallel
it
ought
to
be
quite
clear
that
the
future
american
race
the
future
american
ethnic
type
will
be
formed
of
a
mingling
in
a
yet
to
be
ascertained
proportion
of
the
various
racial
varieties
which
make
up
the
present
population
of
the
united
states
or
to
extend
the
area
a
little
farther
of
the
various
peoples
of
the
northern
hemisphere
of
the
western
continent
for
if
certain
recent
tendencies
are
an
index
of
the
future
it
is
not
safe
to
fix
the
boundaries
of
the
future
united
states
anywhere
short
of
the
arctic
ocean
on
the
north
and
the
isthmus
of
panama
on
the
south
but
even
with
the
continuance
of
the
present
political
divisions
conditions
of
trade
and
ease
of
travel
are
likely
to
gradually
assimilate
to
one
type
all
the
countries
of
the
hemisphere
assuming
that
the
country
is
so
well
settled
that
no
great
disturbance
of
ratios
is
likely
to
result
from
immigration
or
any
serious
conflict
of
races
we
may
safely
build
our
theory
of
a
future
american
race
upon
the
present
population
of
the
country
i
use
the
word
race
here
in
its
popular
sense
that
of
a
people
who
look
substantially
alike
and
are
moulded
by
the
same
culture
and
dominated
by
the
same
ideals
by
the
eleventh
census
the
ratios
of
which
will
probably
not
be
changed
materially
by
the
census
now
under
way
the
total
population
of
the
united
states
was
about
of
which
about
seven
million
were
black
and
colored
and
something
over
were
of
indian
blood
it
is
then
in
the
three
broad
types
white
black
and
indian
that
the
future
american
race
will
find
the
material
for
its
formation
any
dream
of
a
pure
white
race
of
the
type
for
the
united
states
may
as
well
be
abandoned
as
impossible
even
if
desirable
that
such
future
race
will
be
predominantly
white
may
well
be
granted
unless
climate
in
the
course
of
time
should
modify
existing
types
that
it
will
call
itself
white
is
reasonably
sure
that
it
will
conform
closely
to
the
white
type
is
likely
but
that
it
will
have
absorbed
and
assimilated
the
blood
of
the
other
two
races
mentioned
is
as
certain
as
the
operation
of
any
law
well
can
be
that
deals
with
so
uncertain
a
quantity
as
the
human
race
there
are
no
natural
obstacles
to
such
an
amalgamation
the
unity
of
the
race
is
not
only
conceded
but
demonstrated
by
actual
crossing
any
theory
of
sterility
due
to
race
crossing
may
as
well
be
abandoned
it
is
founded
mainly
on
prejudice
and
can
not
be
proved
by
the
facts
if
it
come
from
northern
or
european
sources
it
is
likely
to
be
weakened
by
lack
of
knowledge
if
from
southern
sources
it
is
sure
to
be
colored
by
prejudices
my
own
observation
is
that
in
a
majority
of
cases
people
of
mixed
blood
are
very
prolific
and
very
the
admixture
of
races
in
the
united
states
has
never
taken
place
under
conditions
likely
to
produce
the
best
results
but
there
have
nevertheless
been
enough
conspicuous
instances
to
the
contrary
in
this
country
to
say
nothing
of
a
long
and
honorable
list
in
other
lands
to
disprove
the
theory
that
people
of
mixed
blood
other
things
being
equal
are
less
virile
prolific
or
able
than
those
of
purer
strains
but
whether
this
be
true
or
not
is
apart
from
this
argument
admitting
that
races
may
mix
and
that
they
are
thrown
together
under
conditions
which
permit
their
admixture
the
controlling
motive
will
be
not
abstract
considerations
with
regard
to
a
remote
posterity
but
present
interest
and
inclination
the
indian
element
in
the
united
states
proper
is
so
small
proportionally
about
one
in
three
hundred
and
the
conditions
for
its
amalgamation
so
favorable
that
it
would
of
itself
require
scarcely
any
consideration
in
this
argument
there
is
no
prejudice
against
the
indian
blood
in
solution
a
half
or
removed
from
the
tribal
environment
is
freely
received
among
white
people
after
the
second
or
third
remove
he
may
even
boast
of
his
indian
descent
it
gives
him
a
sort
of
distinction
and
involves
no
social
disability
the
distribution
of
the
indian
race
however
tends
to
make
the
question
largely
a
local
one
and
the
survival
of
tribal
relation
may
postpone
the
results
for
some
little
time
it
will
be
however
the
fault
of
the
united
states
indian
himself
if
he
be
not
speedily
amalgamated
with
the
white
population
the
indian
element
however
looms
up
larger
when
we
include
mexico
and
central
america
in
our
fields
of
discussion
by
the
census
of
mexico
just
completed
over
eighty
per
cent
of
the
population
is
composed
of
mixed
and
indian
races
the
remainder
is
presumably
of
pure
spanish
or
european
blood
with
a
dash
of
negro
along
the
coast
the
population
is
something
over
twelve
millions
thus
adding
nine
millions
of
indians
and
mestizos
to
be
taken
into
account
add
several
millions
of
similar
descent
in
central
america
a
million
in
porto
rico
who
are
said
to
have
an
aboriginal
strain
and
it
may
safely
be
figured
that
the
indian
element
will
be
quite
considerable
in
the
future
american
race
its
amalgamation
will
involve
no
great
difficulty
however
it
has
been
going
on
peacefully
in
the
countries
south
of
us
for
several
centuries
and
is
likely
to
continue
along
similar
lines
the
peculiar
disposition
of
the
american
to
overlook
mixed
blood
in
a
foreigner
will
simplify
the
gradual
absorption
of
these
southern
races
the
real
problem
then
the
only
hard
problem
in
connection
with
the
future
american
race
lies
in
the
negro
element
of
our
population
as
i
have
said
before
i
believe
it
is
destined
to
play
its
part
in
the
formation
of
this
new
type
the
process
by
which
this
will
take
place
will
be
no
sudden
and
wholesale
amalgamation
a
thing
certainly
not
to
be
expected
and
hardly
to
be
desired
if
it
were
held
desirable
and
one
could
imagine
a
government
sufficiently
autocratic
to
enforce
its
behests
it
would
be
no
great
task
to
mix
the
races
mechanically
leaving
to
time
merely
the
fixing
of
the
resultant
type
let
us
for
curiosity
outline
the
process
to
start
with
the
negroes
are
already
considerably
mixed
many
of
them
in
large
proportion
and
most
of
them
in
some
degree
and
the
white
people
as
i
shall
endeavor
to
show
later
on
are
many
of
them
slightly
mixed
with
the
negro
but
we
will
assume
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
that
the
two
races
are
absolutely
pure
we
will
assume
too
that
the
laws
of
the
whole
country
were
as
favorable
to
this
amalgamation
as
the
laws
of
most
southern
states
are
at
present
against
it
that
it
were
made
a
misdemeanor
for
two
white
or
two
colored
persons
to
marry
so
long
as
it
was
possible
to
obtain
a
mate
of
the
other
race
this
would
be
even
more
favorable
than
the
southern
rule
which
makes
no
such
exception
taking
the
population
as
negro
this
eighth
married
to
an
equal
number
of
whites
would
give
in
the
next
generation
a
population
of
which
would
be
mulattoes
mating
these
in
turn
with
white
persons
the
next
generation
would
be
composed
of
quadroons
or
persons
negro
in
the
third
generation
applying
the
same
rule
the
entire
population
would
be
composed
of
octoroons
or
persons
only
negro
who
would
probably
call
themselves
white
if
by
this
time
there
remained
any
particular
advantage
in
being
so
considered
thus
in
three
generations
the
pure
whites
would
be
entirely
eliminated
and
there
would
be
no
perceptible
trace
of
the
blacks
left
the
mechanical
mixture
would
be
complete
as
it
would
probably
be
put
the
white
race
would
have
absorbed
the
black
there
would
be
no
inferior
race
to
domineer
over
there
would
be
no
superior
race
to
oppress
those
who
differed
from
them
in
racial
externals
the
inevitable
social
struggle
which
in
one
form
or
another
seems
to
be
one
of
the
conditions
of
progress
would
proceed
along
other
lines
than
those
of
race
if
now
and
then
for
a
few
generations
an
occasional
trace
of
the
black
ancestor
should
crop
out
no
one
would
care
for
all
would
be
tarred
with
the
same
stick
this
is
already
the
case
in
south
america
parts
of
mexico
and
to
a
large
extent
in
the
west
indies
from
a
negroid
nation
which
ours
is
already
we
would
have
become
a
composite
and
homogeneous
people
and
the
elements
of
racial
discord
which
have
troubled
our
civil
life
so
gravely
and
still
threaten
our
free
institutions
would
have
been
entirely
eliminated
but
this
will
never
happen
the
same
result
will
be
brought
about
slowly
and
obscurely
and
if
the
processes
of
nature
are
not
too
violently
interrupted
by
the
hand
of
man
in
such
a
manner
as
to
produce
the
best
results
with
the
least
disturbance
of
natural
laws
in
another
article
i
shall
endeavor
to
show
that
this
process
has
been
taking
place
with
greater
rapidity
than
is
generally
supposed
and
that
the
results
have
been
such
as
to
encourage
the
belief
that
the
formation
of
a
uniform
type
out
of
our
present
racial
elements
will
take
place
within
a
measurably
near
period
evening
august
a
stream
of
dark
blood
in
the
veins
of
the
southern
whites
i
have
said
that
the
formation
of
the
new
american
race
type
will
take
place
slowly
and
obscurely
for
some
time
to
come
after
the
manner
of
all
healthy
changes
in
nature
i
may
go
further
and
say
that
this
process
has
already
been
going
on
ever
since
the
various
races
in
the
western
world
have
been
brought
into
juxtaposition
slavery
was
a
rich
soil
for
the
production
of
a
mixed
race
and
one
need
only
read
the
literature
and
laws
of
the
past
two
generations
to
see
how
steadily
albeit
slowly
and
insidiously
the
stream
of
dark
blood
has
insinuated
itself
into
the
veins
of
the
dominant
or
as
a
southern
critic
recently
described
it
in
a
paragraph
that
came
under
my
eye
the
domineering
race
the
creole
stories
of
cable
and
other
writers
were
not
mere
figments
of
the
imagination
the
beautiful
octoroon
was
a
corporeal
fact
it
is
more
than
likely
that
she
had
brothers
of
the
same
complexion
though
curiously
enough
the
male
octoroon
has
cut
no
figure
in
fiction
except
in
the
case
of
the
melancholy
honoré
grandissime
and
that
she
and
her
brothers
often
crossed
the
invisible
but
rigid
color
line
was
an
historical
fact
that
only
an
prejudice
could
deny
grace
king
story
of
new
orleans
makes
the
significant
statement
that
the
quadroon
women
of
that
city
preferred
white
fathers
for
their
children
in
order
that
these
latter
might
become
white
and
thereby
be
qualified
to
enter
the
world
of
opportunity
more
than
one
of
the
best
families
of
louisiana
has
a
dark
ancestral
strain
a
conspicuous
american
family
of
southwestern
extraction

recently
contributed

to
a
brilliant
international
marriage

known
by
the

just
exactly
five
generations
removed
from
a
negro
ancestor
one
member
of

society

has
been
known
upon
occasion
when
some
question
of
the
rights
or
privileges
of
the
colored
race
came
up
to
show
a
very
noble
sympathy
for
her
distant
kinsmen
if
american
prejudice
permitted
her
and
others
to
speak
freely
of
her
pedigree
what
a
tower
of
strength
her
name
and
influence
would
be
to
a
despised
and
struggling
race
a
distinguished
american
man
of
letters
now
resident
in
europe
who
spent
many
years
in
north
carolina
has
said
to
the
writer
that
he
had
noted
in
the
course
of
a
long
life
at
least
a
thousand
instances
of
white
persons
known
or
suspected
to
possess
a
strain
of
negro
blood
an
amusing
instance
of
this
sort
occurred
a
year
or
two
ago
it
was
announced
through
the
newspapers
whose
omniscience
of
course
no
one
would
question
that
a
certain
great
merchant
of
chicago
was
a
mulatto
this
gentleman
had
a
large
dry
goods
trade
in
the
south
notably
in
texas
shortly
after
the
publication
of
the
item
reflecting
on
the
immaculateness
of
the
merchant
descent
there
appeared
in
the
texas
newspapers
among
the
advertising
matter
a
statement
from
the
chicago
merchant
characterizing
the
rumor
as
a
malicious
falsehood
concocted
by
his
rivals
in
business
and
incidentally
calling
attention
to
the
excellent
bargains
offered
to
retailers
and
jobbers
at
his
great
emporium
a
is
found
in
the
case
of
a
certain
bishop
recently
elected
of
the
african
methodist
episcopal
church
who
is
accused
of
being
a
white
man
a
colored
editor
who
possesses
the
saving
grace
of
humor
along
with
other
talents
of
a
high
order
gravely
observed
in
discussing
this
rumor
that
the
poor
man
could
not
help
it
even
if
he
were
white
and
that
a
fact
for
which
he
was
in
no
wise
responsible
should
not
be
allowed
to
stand
in
the
way
of
his
advancement
during
a
residence
in
north
carolina
in
my
youth
and
early
manhood
i
noted
many
curious
phases
of
the
race
problem
i
have
in
mind
a
family
of
three
sisters
so
aggressively
white
that
the
old
popular
southern
legend
that
they
were
the
unacknowledged
children
of
white
parents
was
current
concerning
them
there
was
absolutely
not
the
slightest
earmark
of
the
negro
about
them
it
may
be
stated
here
as
another
race
fallacy
that
the
telltale
dark
mark
at
the
root
of
the
nails
supposed
to
be
an
infallible
test
of
negro
blood
is
a
delusion
and
a
snare
and
of
no
value
whatever
as
a
test
of
race
it
belongs
with
the
grewsome
superstition
that
a
woman
apparently
white
may
give
birth
to
a
child
by
a
white
father
another
instance
that
came
under
my
eye
was
that
of
a
very
beautiful
girl
with
soft
wavy
brown
hair
who
is
now
living
in
a
far
western
state
as
the
wife
of
a
white
husband
a
typical
case
was
that
of
a
family
in
which
the
tradition
of
negro
origin
had
persisted
long
after
all
trace
of
it
had
disappeared
the
family
took
its
origin
from
a
white
ancestress
and
had
consequently
been
free
for
several
generations
the
father
of
the
first
colored
child
counting
the
family
in
the
female
line
the
only
way
it
could
be
counted
was
a
mulatto
a
second
infusion
of
white
blood
this
time
on
the
paternal
side
resulted
in
offspring
not
distinguishable
from
pure
white
one
child
of
this
generation
emigrated
to
what
was
then
the
far
west
married
a
white
woman
and
reared
a
large
family
whose
descendants
now
in
the
fourth
or
fifth
remove
from
the
negro
are
in
all
probability
wholly
unaware
of
their
origin
a
sister
of
this
pioneer
emigrant
remained
in
the
place
of
her
birth
and
formed
an
irregular
union
with
a
white
man
of
means
with
whom
she
lived
for
many
years
and
for
whom
she
bore
a
large
number
of
children
who
became
about
evenly
divided
between
white
and
colored
fixing
their
status
by
the
marriages
they
made
one
of
the
daughters
for
instance
married
a
white
man
and
reared
in
a
neighboring
county
a
family
of
white
children
who
in
all
probability
were
as
active
as
any
one
else
in
the
recent
ferocious
campaign
to
disfranchise
the
negroes
in
this
same
town
there
was
stationed
once
before
the
war
at
the
federal
arsenal
there
located
an
officer
who
fell
in
love
with
a
white
negro
girl
as
our
southern
friends
impartially
dub
them
this
officer
subsequently
left
the
army
and
carried
away
with
him
to
the
north
the
whole
family
of
his
inamorata
he
married
the
woman
and
their
descendants
who
live
in
a
large
western
city
are
not
known
at
all
as
persons
of
color
and
show
no
trace
of
their
dark
origin
two
notable
bishops
of
the
roman
catholic
communion
in
the
united
states
are
known
to
be
the
sons
of
a
slave
mother
and
a
white
father
who
departing
from
the
usual
american
rule
gave
his
sons
freedom
education
and
a
chance
in
life
instead
of
sending
them
to
the
auction

colonel

in
his
relates
the
story
of
a
white
colored
woman
whom
he
assisted
in
her
escape
from
slavery
or
its
consequences
who
married
a
white
man
in
the
vicinity
of
boston
and
lost
her
identity
with
the
colored
race
how
many
others
there
must
be
who
know
of
similar
instances
grace
king
in
her
story
of
new
orleans
to
which
i
have
referred
in
speaking
of
a
louisiana
law
which
required
the
public
records
when
dealing
with
persons
of
color
always
to
specify
the
fact
of
color
in
order
so
far
had
the
admixture
of
races
gone
to
distinguish
them
from
whites
says
but
the
officers
of
the
law
could
be
bribed
and
the
qualification
once
dropped
acted
inversely
as
a
patent
of
pure
blood
a
certain
shakspearean
actress
has
a
strain
of
negro
blood
and
a
popular
leading
man
under
a
manager
is
similarly
gifted
it
would
be
interesting
to
give
their
names
but
would
probably
only
injure
them
if
they
could
themselves
speak
of
their
origin
without
any
unpleasant
consequences
it
would
be
a
handsome
thing
for
the
colored
race
that
they
do
not
is
no
reproach
to
them
they
are
white
to
all
intents
and
purposes
even
by
the
curious
laws
of
the
curious
states
from
which
they
derived
their
origin
and
are
in
all
conscience
entitled
to
any
advantage
accompanying
this
status
anyone
at
all
familiar
with
the
hopes
and
aspirations
of
the
colored
race
as
expressed
for
instance
in
their
prolific
newspaper
literature
must
have
perceived
the
wonderful
inspiration
which
they
have
drawn
from
the
career
of
a
few
distinguished
europeans
of
partial
negro
ancestry
who
have
felt
no
call
by
way
of
social
prejudice
to
deny
or
conceal
their
origin
or
to
refuse
their
sympathy
to
those
who
need
it
so
much
pushkin
the
russian
shakspeare
had
a
black
ancestor
one
of
the
chief
editors
of
the
london
who
died
a
few
years
ago
was
a
west
indian
colored
man
who
had
no
interest
in
concealing
the
fact
one
of
the
generals
of
the
british
army
is
similarly
favored
although
the
fact
is
not
often
referred
to
general
alfred
dodds
the
ranking
general
of
the
french
army
now
in
command
in
china
is
a
quadroon
the
poet
robert
browning
was
of
west
indian
origin
and
some
of
his
intimate
personal
friends
maintained
and
proved
to
their
own
satisfaction
that
he
was
partly
of
negro
descent
browning
always
said
that
he
did
not
know
that
there
was
no
family
tradition
to
that
effect
but
if
it
could
be
demonstrated
he
would
admit
it
freely
enough
if
it
would
reflect
any
credit
upon
a
race
who
needed
it
so
badly
the
most
conspicuous
of
the
eurafricans
to
coin
a
word
were
the
dumas
family
who
were
distinguished
for
three
generations
the
mulatto
general
dumas
won
distinction
in
the
wars
under
the
revolution
his
son
the
famous
alexandre
dumas
has
delighted
several
generations
with
his
novels
and
founded
a
school
of
fiction
his
son
alexandre
novelist
and
dramatist
was
as
supreme
in
his
own
line
as
his
father
had
been
in
his
old
alexandre
gives
his
pedigree
in
detail
in
his
memoirs
and
the
negro
origin
of
the
family
is
set
out
in
every
encyclopaedia
nevertheless
in
a
literary
magazine
of
recent
date
published
in
new
york
it
was
gravely
stated
by
a
writer
that
there
was
a
rumor
probably
not
well
founded
that
the
author
of
had
a
very
distant
strain
of
negro
blood
if
this
had
been
written
with
reference
to
some
living
american
of
obscure
origin
its
point
might
be
appreciated
but
such
extreme
delicacy
in
stating
so
widely
known
a
fact
appeals
to
one
sense
of
humor
these
european
gentlemen
could
be
outspoken
about
their
origin
because
it
carried
with
it
no
social
stigma
or
disability
whatever
when
such
a
state
of
public
opinion
exists
in
the
united
states
there
may
be
a
surprising
revision
of
pedigrees
a
little
incident
that
occurred
not
long
ago
near
boston
will
illustrate
the
complexity
of
these
race
relations
three
men
brothers
by
the
name
we
will
say
of
green
living
in
a
boston
suburb
married
respectively
a
white
a
brown
and
a
black
woman
the
children
with
the
white
mother
became
known
as
white
and
associated
with
white
people
the
others
were
frankly
colored
by
a
not
unlikely
coincidence
in
the
course
of
time
the
children
of
the
three
families
found
themselves
in
the
same
public
school
curiously
enough
one
afternoon
the
three
sets
of
green
children
the
white
greens
the
brown
greens
and
the
black
greens
were
detained
after
school
and
were
all
directed
to
report
to
a
certain
schoolroom
where
they
were
assigned
certain
tasks
at
the
blackboards
about
the
large
room
still
more
curiously
most
of
the
teachers
of
the
school
happened
to
have
business
in
this
particular
room
on
that
particular
afternoon
and
all
of
them
seemed
greatly
interested
in
the
green
children
well
well
did
you
ever
just
think
of
it
and
they
are
all
first
cousins
was
remarked
audibly
the
children
were
small
but
they
lived
in
boston
and
were
of
course
as
became
boston
children
preternaturally
intelligent
for
their
years
they
reported
to
their
parents
the
incident
and
a
number
of
remarks
of
a
similar
tenor
to
the
one
above
quoted
the
result
was
a
complaint
to
the
school
authorities
and
a
reprimand
to
several
teachers
a
curious
feature
of
the
affair
lay
in
the
source
from
which
the
complaint
emanated
one
might
suppose
it
to
have
come
from
the
white
greens
but
no
they
were
willing
that
the
incident
should
pass
unnoticed
and
be
promptly
forgotten
publicity
would
only
advertise
a
fact
which
would
work
to
their
social
injury
the
dark
greens
rather
enjoyed
the
affair
they
had
nothing
to
lose
they
had
no
objections
to
being
known
as
the
cousins
of
the
others
and
experienced
a
certain
not
unnatural
pleasure
in
their
discomfiture
the
complaint
came
from
the
brown
greens
the
reader
can
figure
out
the
psychology
of
it
for
himself
a
more
certain
proof
of
the
fact
that
negro
blood
is
widely
distributed
among
the
white
people
may
be
found
in
the
laws
and
judicial
decisions
of
the
various
states
laws
as
a
rule
are
not
made
until
demanded
by
a
sufficient
number
of
specific
cases
to
call
for
a
general
rule
and
judicial
decisions
of
course
are
never
announced
except
as
the
result
of
litigation
over
contested
facts
there
is
no
better
index
of
the
character
and
genius
of
a
people
than
their
laws
in
north
carolina
marriage
between
white
persons
and
free
persons
of
color
was
lawful
until
by
the
missouri
code
of
the
color
line
was
drawn
at
of
negro
blood
and
persons
of
only
were
legally
white
the
same
rule
was
laid
down
by
the
mississippi
code
of
under
the
old
code
noir
of
louisiana
the
descendant
of
a
white
and
a
quadroon
was
white
under
these
laws
many
persons
currently
known
as
colored
or
more
recently
as
negro
would
be
legally
white
if
they
chose
to
claim
and
exercise
the
privilege
in
ohio
before
the
civil
war
a
person
more
than
was
legally
entitled
to
all
the
rights
of
a
white
man
in
south
carolina
the
line
of
cleavage
was
left
somewhat
indefinite
the
color
line
was
drawn
tentatively
at
of
negro
blood
but
this
was
not
held
conclusive
the
term
said
the
supreme
court
of
that
state
in
a
reported
case
is
not
invariably
applicable
to
every
admixture
of
african
blood
with
the
european
nor
is
one
having
all
the
features
of
a
white
to
be
ranked
with
the
degraded
class
designated
by
the
laws
of
the
state
as
persons
of
color
because
of
some
remote
taint
of
the
negro
race
the
question
whether
persons
are
colored
or
white
where
color
or
feature
is
doubtful
is
for
the
jury
to
determine
by
reputation
by
reception
into
society
and
by
their
exercises
of
the
privileges
of
a
white
man
as
well
as
by
admixture
of
blood
it
is
well
known
that
this
liberality
of
view
grew
out
of
widespread
conditions
in
the
state
which
these
decisions
in
their
turn
tended
to
emphasize
they
were
probably
due
to
the
large
preponderance
of
colored
people
in
the
state
which
rendered
the
whites
the
more
willing
to
augment
their
own
number
there
are
many
interesting
decisions
in
the
reports
of
the
southern
courts
which
space
will
not
permit
the
mention
of
in
another
article
i
shall
consider
certain
conditions
which
retard
the
development
of
the
future
american
race
type
which
i
have
suggested
as
well
as
certain
other
tendencies
which
are
likely
to
promote
it
evening
august
a
complete
likely
to
occur
i
have
endeavored
in
two
former
letters
to
set
out
the
reasons
why
it
seems
likely
that
the
future
american
ethnic
type
will
be
formed
by
a
fusion
of
all
the
various
races
now
peopling
this
continent
and
to
show
that
this
process
has
been
under
way
slowly
but
surely
like
all
evolutionary
movements
for
several
hundred
years
i
wish
now
to
consider
some
of
the
conditions
which
will
retard
this
fusion
as
well
as
certain
other
facts
which
tend
to
promote
it
the
indian
phase
of
the
problem
so
far
at
least
as
the
united
states
is
concerned
has
been
practically
disposed
of
in
what
has
already
been
said
the
absorption
of
the
indians
will
be
delayed
so
long
as
the
tribal
relations
continue
and
so
long
as
the
indians
are
treated
as
wards
of
the
government
instead
of
being
given
their
rights
once
for
all
and
placed
upon
the
footing
of
other
citizens
it
is
presumed
that
this
will
come
about
as
the
wilder
indians
are
educated
and
by
the
development
of
the
country
brought
into
closer
contact
with
civilization
which
must
happen
before
a
very
great
while
as
has
been
stated
there
is
no
very
strong
prejudice
against
the
indian
blood
a
farm
or
a
comfortable
fortune
will
secure
a
white
husband
for
a
comely
indian
girl
any
day
with
some
latitude
and
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
such
strong
race
instinct
or
organization
as
will
make
the
indians
of
the
future
wish
to
perpetuate
themselves
as
a
small
and
insignificant
class
in
a
great
population
thus
emphasizing
distinctions
which
would
be
overlooked
in
the
case
of
the
individual
the
indian
will
fade
into
the
white
population
as
soon
as
he
chooses
and
in
the
united
states
proper
the
slender
indian
strain
will
ere
long
leave
no
trace
discoverable
by
anyone
but
the
anthropological
expert
in
new
mexico
and
central
america
on
the
contrary
the
chances
seem
to
be
that
the
indian
will
first
absorb
the
elements
unless
which
is
not
unlikely
european
immigration
shall
increase
the
white
contingent
the
negro
element
remains
then
the
only
one
which
seems
likely
to
present
any
difficulty
of
assimilation
the
main
obstacle
that
retards
the
absorption
of
the
negro
into
the
general
population
is
the
apparently
intense
prejudice
against
color
which
prevails
in
the
united
states
this
prejudice
loses
much
of
its
importance
however
when
it
is
borne
in
mind
that
it
is
almost
purely
local
and
does
not
exist
in
quite
the
same
form
anywhere
else
in
the
world
except
among
the
boers
of
south
africa
where
it
prevails
in
an
even
more
aggravated
form
and
as
i
shall
endeavor
to
show
this
prejudice
in
the
united
states
is
more
apparent
than
real
and
is
a
caste
prejudice
which
is
merely
accentuated
by
differences
of
race
at
present
however
i
wish
to
consider
it
merely
as
a
deterrent
to
amalgamation
this
prejudice
finds
forcible
expression
in
the
laws
which
prevail
in
all
the
southern
states
without
exception
forbidding
the
intermarriage
of
white
persons
and
persons
of
color
these
last
being
generally
defined
within
certain
degrees
while
it
is
evident
that
such
laws
alone
will
not
prevent
the
intermingling
of
races
which
goes
merrily
on
in
spite
of
them
it
is
equally
apparent
that
this
placing
of
mixed
marriages
beyond
the
pale
of
the
law
is
a
powerful
deterrent
to
any
honest
or
dignified
amalgamation
add
to
this
legal
restriction
which
is
enforced
by
severe
penalties
the
social
odium
accruing
to
the
white
party
to
such
a
union
and
it
may
safely
be
predicted
that
so
long
as
present
conditions
prevail
in
the
south
there
will
be
little
marrying
or
giving
in
marriage
between
persons
of
different
race
so
ferocious
is
this
sentiment
against
intermarriage
that
in
a
recent
missouri
case
where
a
colored
man
ran
away
with
and
married
a
young
white
woman
the
man
was
pursued
by
a
posse
a
word
which
is
rapidly
being
debased
from
its
proper
meaning
by
its
use
in
the
attempt
to
dignify
the
character
of
lawless
southern
mobs
and
shot
to
death
the
woman
was
tried
and
convicted
of
the
crime
of
miscegenation
another
honest
word
which
the
south
degrades
along
with
the
negro
another
obstacle
to
race
fusion
lies
in
the
drastic
and
increasing
proscriptive
legislation
by
which
the
south
attempts
to
keep
the
white
and
colored
races
apart
in
every
place
where
their
joint
presence
might
be
taken
to
imply
equality
or
to
put
it
more
directly
the
persistent
effort
to
degrade
the
negro
to
a
distinctly
and
permanently
inferior
caste
this
is
undertaken
by
means
of
separate
schools
separate
railroad
and
street
cars
political
disfranchisement
debasing
and
abhorrent
prison
systems
and
an
unflagging
campaign
of
calumny
by
which
the
vices
and
shortcomings
of
the
negroes
are
grossly
magnified
and
their
virtues
practically
lost
sight
of
the
popular
argument
that
the
negro
ought
to
develop
his
own
civilization
and
has
no
right
to
share
in
that
of
the
white
race
unless
by
favor
comes
with
poor
grace
from
those
who
are
forcing
their
civilization
upon
others
at
the
cannon
mouth
it
is
moreover
uncandid
and
unfair
the
white
people
of
the
present
generation
did
not
make
their
civilization
they
inherited
it
and
much
of
the
wealth
which
is
so
strong
a
factor
in
their
power
was
created
by
the
unpaid
labor
of
the
colored
people
the
present
generation
has
however
brought
to
a
high
state
of
development
one
distinctively
american
institution
for
which
it
is
entitled
to
such
credit
as
it
may
wish
to
claim
i
refer
to
the
custom
of
lynching
with
its
attendant
horrors
the
principal
deterrent
to
race
admixture
however
is
the
low
industrial
and
social
efficiency
of
the
colored
race
if
it
be
conceded
that
these
are
the
result
of
environment
then
their
cause
is
not
far
to
seek
and
the
cure
is
also
in
sight
their
poverty
their
ignorance
and
their
servile
estate
render
them
as
yet
largely
ineligible
for
social
fusion
with
a
race
whose
pride
is
fed
not
only
by
the
record
of
its
achievements
but
by
a
constant
comparison
with
a
less
developed
and
less
fortunate
race
which
it
has
held
so
long
in
subjection
the
forces
that
tend
to
the
future
absorption
of
the
black
race
are
however
vastly
stronger
than
those
arrayed
against
it
as
experience
has
demonstrated
slavery
was
favorable
to
the
mixing
of
races
the
growth
under
healthy
civil
conditions
of
a
large
and
colored
citizenship
would
doubtless
tend
to
lessen
the
clandestine
association
of
the
two
races
but
the
effort
to
degrade
the
negro
may
result
if
successful
in
a
partial
restoration
of
the
old
status
but
assuming
that
the
present
legislation
is
but
a
temporary
reaction
then
the
steady
progress
of
the
colored
race
in
wealth
and
culture
and
social
efficiency
will
in
the
course
of
time
materially
soften
the
asperities
of
racial
prejudice
and
permit
them
to
approach
the
whites
more
closely
until
in
time
the
prejudice
against
intermarriage
shall
have
been
overcome
by
other
considerations
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
possession
of
a
million
dollars
with
the
ability
to
use
it
to
the
best
advantage
would
throw
such
a
golden
glow
over
a
dark
complexion
as
to
override
anything
but
a
very
obdurate
prejudice
spahr
in
his
and
impartial
book
on
working
states
as
his
conclusion
after
a
careful
study
of
conditions
in
the
south
that
the
most
advanced
third
of
the
negroes
of
that
section
has
already
in
one
generation
of
limited
opportunity
passed
in
the
race
of
life
the
least
advanced
third
of
the
whites
to
pass
the
next
third
will
prove
a
more
difficult
task
no
doubt
but
the
negroes
will
have
the
impetus
of
their
forward
movement
to
push
them
ahead
the
outbreaks
of
race
prejudice
in
recent
years
are
the
surest
evidence
of
the
negro
progress
no
effort
is
required
to
keep
down
a
race
which
manifests
no
desire
nor
ability
to
rise
but
with
each
new
forward
movement
of
the
colored
race
it
is
brought
into
contact
with
the
whites
at
some
fresh
point
which
evokes
a
new
manifestation
of
prejudice
until
custom
has
adjusted
things
to
the
new
condition
when
all
negroes
were
poor
and
ignorant
they
could
be
denied
their
rights
with
impunity
as
they
grow
in
knowledge
and
in
wealth
they
become
more
and
make
it
correspondingly
troublesome
for
those
who
would
ignore
their
claims
it
is
much
easier
by
a
supreme
effort
as
recently
attempted
with
temporary
success
in
north
carolina
to
knock
the
race
down
and
rob
it
of
its
rights
once
for
all
than
to
repeat
the
process
from
day
to
day
and
with
each
individual
it
saves
wear
and
tear
on
the
conscience
and
makes
it
easy
to
maintain
a
superiority
which
it
might
in
the
course
of
a
short
time
require
some
little
effort
to
keep
up
this
very
proscription
however
political
and
civil
at
the
south
social
all
over
the
country
varying
somewhat
in
degree
will
unless
very
soon
relaxed
prove
a
powerful
factor
in
the
mixture
of
the
races
if
it
is
only
by
becoming
white
that
colored
people
and
their
children
are
to
enjoy
the
rights
and
dignities
of
citizenship
they
will
have
every
incentive
to
lighten
the
breed
to
use
a
current
phrase
that
they
may
claim
the
white
man
privileges
as
soon
as
possible
that
this
motive
is
already
at
work
may
be
seen
in
the
enormous
extent
to
which
certain
face
bleachers
and
hair
straighteners
are
advertised
in
the
newspapers
printed
for
circulation
among
the
colored
people
the
most
powerful
factor
in
achieving
any
result
is
the
wish
to
bring
it
about
the
only
thing
that
ever
succeeded
in
keeping
two
races
separated
when
living
on
the
same
soil
the
only
true
ground
of
caste
is
religion
and
as
has
been
alluded
to
in
the
case
of
the
jews
this
is
only
superficially
successful
the
colored
people
are
the
same
as
the
whites
in
religion
they
have
the
same
standards
and
mediums
of
culture
the
same
ideals
and
the
presence
of
the
successful
white
race
as
a
constant
incentive
to
their
ambition
the
ultimate
result
is
not
difficult
to
foresee
the
races
will
be
quite
as
effectively
amalgamated
by
lightening
the
negroes
as
they
would
be
by
darkening
the
whites
it
is
only
a
social
fiction
indeed
which
makes
of
a
person
white
a
negro
he
is
really
much
more
a
white
man
the
hope
of
the
negro
so
far
as
the
field
of
moral
sympathy
and
support
in
his
aspirations
is
concerned
lies
as
always
chiefly
in
the
north
there
the
forces
which
tend
to
his
elevation
are
in
the
main
allowed
their
natural
operation
the
exaggerated
zeal
with
which
the
south
is
rushing
to
degrade
the
negro
is
likely
to
result
as
in
the
case
of
slavery
in
making
more
friends
for
him
at
the
north
and
if
the
north
shall
not
see
fit
to
interfere
forcibly
with
southern
legislation
it
may
at
least
feel
disposed
to
emphasize
by
its
own
liberality
its
disapproval
of
southern
injustice
and
barbarity
an
interesting
instance
of
the
difference
between
the
north
and
the
south
in
regard
to
colored
people
may
be
found
in
two
cases
which
only
last
year
came
up
for
trial
in
two
adjoining
border
states
a
colored
man
living
in
maryland
went
over
to
washington
and
married
a
white
woman
the
marriage
was
legal
in
washington
when
they
returned
to
their
maryland
home
they
were
arrested
for
the
crime
of
miscegenation
perhaps
it
is
only
a
misdemeanor
in
maryland
and
sentenced
to
fine
and
imprisonment
the
penalty
of
death
not
extending
so
far
north
the
same
month
a
couple
one
white
and
one
colored
were
arrested
in
new
jersey
for
living
in
adultery
they
were
found
guilty
by
the
court
but
punishment
was
withheld
upon
a
promise
that
they
would
marry
immediately
or
as
some
cynic
would
undoubtedly
say
the
punishment
was
commuted
from
imprisonment
to
matrimony
the
adding
to
our
territories
of
large
areas
populated
by
dark
races
some
of
them
already
liberally
dowered
with
negro
blood
will
enhance
the
relative
importance
of
the
elements
of
the
population
and
largely
increase
the
flow
of
dark
blood
toward
the
white
race
until
the
time
shall
come
when
distinctions
of
color
shall
lose
their
importance
which
will
be
but
the
prelude
to
a
complete
racial
fusion
the
formation
of
this
future
american
race
is
not
a
pressing
problem
because
of
the
conditions
under
which
it
must
take
place
it
is
likely
to
be
extremely
slow
much
slower
indeed
in
our
temperate
climate
and
highly
organized
society
than
in
the
american
tropics
and
where
it
is
already
well
under
way
if
not
a
that
it
must
come
in
the
united
states
sooner
or
later
seems
to
be
a
foregone
conclusion
as
the
result
of
natural
law
dura
sed
tamen
a
hard
pill
but
one
which
must
be
swallowed
there
can
manifestly
be
no
such
thing
as
a
peaceful
and
progressive
civilization
in
a
nation
divided
by
two
warring
races
and
homogeneity
of
type
at
least
in
externals
is
a
necessary
condition
of
harmonious
social
progress
if
this
then
must
come
the
development
and
progress
of
all
the
constituent
elements
of
the
future
american
race
is
of
the
utmost
importance
as
bearing
upon
the
quality
of
the
resultant
type
the
white
race
is
still
susceptible
of
some
improvement
and
if
in
time
the
more
objectionable
negro
traits
are
eliminated
and
his
better
qualities
correspondingly
developed
his
part
in
the
future
american
race
may
well
be
an
important
and
valuable
one
evening
september
the
disfranchisement
of
the
negro
the
right
of
american
citizens
of
african
descent
commonly
called
negroes
to
vote
upon
the
same
terms
as
other
citizens
of
the
united
states
is
plainly
declared
and
firmly
fixed
by
the
constitution
no
such
person
is
called
upon
to
present
reasons
why
he
should
possess
this
right
that
question
is
foreclosed
by
the
constitution
the
object
of
the
elective
franchise
is
to
give
representation
so
long
as
the
constitution
retains
its
present
form
any
state
constitution
or
statute
which
seeks
by
juggling
the
ballot
to
deny
the
colored
race
fair
representation
is
a
clear
violation
of
the
fundamental
law
of
the
land
and
a
corresponding
injustice
to
those
thus
deprived
of
this
right
for
years
this
has
been
the
law
as
long
as
it
was
measurably
respected
the
colored
people
made
rapid
strides
in
education
wealth
character
and
this
the
census
proves
all
statements
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
a
generation
has
grown
to
manhood
and
womanhood
under
the
great
inspiring
freedom
conferred
by
the
constitution
and
protected
by
the
right
of
suffrage
protected
in
large
degree
by
the
mere
naked
right
even
when
its
exercise
was
hindered
or
denied
by
unlawful
means
they
have
developed
in
every
southern
community
good
citizens
who
if
sustained
and
encouraged
by
just
laws
and
liberal
institutions
would
greatly
augment
their
number
with
the
passing
years
and
soon
wipe
out
the
reproach
of
ignorance
unthrift
low
morals
and
social
inefficiency
thrown
at
them
indiscriminately
and
therefore
unjustly
and
made
the
excuse
for
the
equally
undiscriminating
contempt
of
their
persons
and
their
rights
they
have
reduced
their
illiteracy
nearly
per
cent
excluded
from
the
institutions
of
higher
learning
in
their
own
states
their
young
men
hold
their
own
and
occasionally
carry
away
honors
in
the
universities
of
the
north
they
have
accumulated
three
hundred
million
dollars
worth
of
real
and
personal
property
individuals
among
them
have
acquired
substantial
wealth
and
several
have
attained
to
something
like
national
distinction
in
art
letters
and
educational
leadership
they
are
numerously
represented
in
the
learned
professions
heavily
handicapped
they
have
made
such
rapid
progress
that
the
suspicion
is
justified
that
their
advancement
rather
than
any
stagnation
or
retrogression
is
the
true
secret
of
the
virulent
southern
hostility
to
their
rights
which
has
so
influenced
northern
opinion
that
it
stands
mute
and
leaves
the
colored
people
upon
whom
the
north
conferred
liberty
to
the
tender
mercies
of
those
who
have
always
denied
their
fitness
for
it
it
may
be
said
in
passing
that
the
word
negro
where
used
in
this
paper
is
used
solely
for
convenience
by
the
census
of
there
were
colored
people
in
the
country
who
were
half
or
more
than
half
white
and
logically
there
must
be
as
in
fact
there
are
so
many
who
share
the
white
blood
in
some
degree
as
to
justify
the
assertion
that
the
race
problem
in
the
united
states
concerns
the
welfare
and
the
status
of
a
mixed
race
their
rights
are
not
one
whit
the
more
sacred
because
of
this
fact
but
in
an
argument
where
injustice
is
sought
to
be
excused
because
of
fundamental
differences
of
race
it
is
well
enough
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
race
whose
rights
and
liberties
are
endangered
all
over
this
country
by
disfranchisement
at
the
south
are
the
colored
people
who
live
in
the
united
states
and
not
the
lowbrowed
savage
whom
the
southern
white
likes
to
set
upon
a
block
and
contrast
with
shakespeare
and
newton
and
washington
and
lincoln
despite
and
in
defiance
of
the
federal
constitution
in
the
six
southern
states
of
mississippi
louisiana
alabama
north
carolina
south
carolina
and
virginia
containing
an
aggregate
colored
population
of
about
these
have
been
to
all
intents
and
purposes
denied
so
far
as
the
states
can
effect
it
the
right
to
vote
this
disfranchisement
is
accomplished
by
various
methods
devised
with
much
transparent
ingenuity
the
effort
being
in
each
instance
to
violate
the
spirit
of
the
federal
constitution
by
disfranchising
the
negro
while
seeming
to
respect
its
letter
by
avoiding
the
mention
of
race
or
color
these
restrictions
fall
into
three
groups
the
first
comprises
a
property
qualification
the
ownership
of
worth
or
more
of
real
or
personal
property
alabama
louisiana
virginia
and
south
carolina
the
payment
of
a
poll
tax
mississippi
north
carolina
virginia
an
educational
qualification
the
ability
to
read
and
write
alabama
louisiana
north
carolina
thus
far
those
who
believe
in
a
restricted
suffrage
everywhere
could
perhaps
find
no
reasonable
fault
with
any
one
of
these
qualifications
applied
either
separately
or
together
but
the
negro
has
made
such
progress
that
these
restrictions
alone
would
perhaps
not
deprive
him
of
effective
representation
hence
the
second
group
this
comprises
an
understanding
clause
the
applicant
must
be
able
to
read
or
understand
when
read
to
him
any
clause
in
the
constitution
mississippi
or
to
read
and
explain
or
to
understand
and
explain
when
read
to
him
any
section
of
the
constitution
virginia
an
employment
qualification
the
voter
must
be
regularly
employed
in
some
lawful
occupation
alabama
a
character
qualification
the
voter
must
be
a
person
of
good
character
and
who
understands
the
duties
and
obligations
of
citizens
under
a
republican
form
of
government
alabama
the
qualifications
under
the
first
group
it
will
be
seen
are
capable
of
exact
demonstration
those
under
the
second
group
are
left
to
the
discretion
and
judgment
of
the
registering
officer
for
in
most
instances
these
are
all
requirements
for
registration
which
must
precede
voting
but
the
first
group
by
its
own
force
and
the
second
group
under
imaginable
conditions
might
exclude
not
only
the
negro
vote
but
a
large
part
of
the
white
vote
hence
the
third
group
which
comprises
a
military
service
qualification
any
man
who
went
to
war
willingly
or
unwillingly
in
a
good
cause
or
a
bad
is
entitled
to
register
a
prescriptive
qualification
under
which
are
included
all
male
persons
who
were
entitled
to
vote
on
january
at
which
date
the
negro
had
not
yet
been
given
the
right
to
vote
a
hereditary
qualification
the
grandfather
clause
whereby
any
son
or
descendant
of
a
soldier
and
the
descendant
of
any
person
who
had
the
right
to
vote
on
january
inherits
that
right
if
the
voter
wish
to
take
advantage
of
these
last
provisions
which
are
in
the
nature
of
exceptions
to
a
general
rule
he
must
register
within
a
stated
time
whereupon
he
becomes
a
member
of
a
privileged
class
of
permanently
enrolled
voters
not
subject
to
any
of
the
other
restrictions
it
will
be
seen
that
these
restrictions
are
variously
combined
in
the
different
states
and
it
is
apparent
that
if
combined
to
their
declared
end
practically
every
negro
may
under
color
of
law
be
denied
the
right
to
vote
and
practically
every
white
man
accorded
that
right
the
effectiveness
of
these
provisions
to
exclude
the
negro
vote
is
proved
by
the
alabama
registration
under
the
new
state
constitution
out
of
a
total
by
the
census
of
of
negro
males
of
voting
age
less
than
are
registered
in
montgomery
county
alone
the
seat
of
the
state
capital
where
there
are
negro
males
of
voting
age
only
have
been
allowed
to
register
while
in
several
counties
not
one
single
negro
is
permitted
to
exercise
the
franchise
these
methods
of
disfranchisement
have
stood
such
tests
as
the
united
states
courts
including
the
supreme
court
have
thus
far
seen
fit
to
apply
in
such
cases
as
have
been
before
them
for
adjudication
these
include
a
case
based
upon
the
understanding
clause
of
the
mississippi
constitution
in
which
the
supreme
court
held
in
effect
that
since
there
was
no
ambiguity
in
the
language
employed
and
the
negro
was
not
directly
named
the
court
would
not
go
behind
the
wording
of
the
constitution
to
find
a
meaning
which
discriminated
against
the
colored
voter
and
the
recent
case
of
jackson
giles
brought
by
a
colored
citizen
of
montgomery
alabama
in
which
the
supreme
court
confesses
itself
impotent
to
provide
a
remedy
for
what
by
inference
it
acknowledges
may
be
a
great
political
wrong
carefully
avoiding
however
to
state
that
it
is
a
wrong
although
the
vital
prayer
of
the
petition
was
for
a
decision
upon
this
very
point
now
what
is
the
effect
of
this
wholesale
disfranchisement
of
colored
men
upon
their
citizenship
the
value
of
food
to
the
human
organism
is
not
measured
by
the
pains
of
an
occasional
surfeit
but
by
the
effect
of
its
entire
deprivation
whether
a
class
of
citizens
should
vote
even
if
not
always
wisely
what
class
does
may
best
be
determined
by
considering
their
condition
when
they
are
without
the
right
to
vote
the
colored
people
are
left
in
the
states
where
they
have
been
disfranchised
absolutely
without
representation
direct
or
indirect
in
any
body
in
any
court
of
justice
in
any
branch
of
government
for
the
feeble
remnant
of
voters
left
by
law
is
so
inconsiderable
as
to
be
without
a
shadow
of
power
constituting
of
the
population
of
the
whole
country
of
the
whole
southern
people
and
a
majority
in
several
states
they
are
not
able
because
disfranchised
where
most
numerous
to
send
one
representative
to
the
congress
which
by
the
decision
in
the
alabama
case
is
held
by
the
supreme
court
to
be
the
only
body
outside
of
the
state
itself
competent
to
give
relief
from
a
great
political
wrong
by
former
decisions
of
the
same
tribunal
even
congress
is
impotent
to
protect
their
civil
rights
the
fourteenth
amendment
having
long
since
by
the
consent
of
the
same
court
been
in
many
respects
as
completely
nullified
as
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
now
sought
to
be
they
have
no
direct
representation
in
any
southern
legislature
and
no
voice
in
determining
the
choice
of
white
men
who
might
be
friendly
to
their
rights
nor
are
they
able
to
influence
the
election
of
judges
or
other
public
officials
to
whom
are
entrusted
the
protection
of
their
lives
their
liberties
and
their
property
no
judge
is
rendered
careful
no
sheriff
diligent
for
fear
that
he
may
offend
a
black
constituency
the
contrary
is
most
lamentably
true
day
after
day
the
catalogue
of
lynchings
and
riots
upon
every
imaginable
pretext
grows
longer
and
more
appalling
the
country
stands
face
to
face
with
the
revival
of
slavery
at
the
moment
of
this
writing
a
federal
grand
jury
in
alabama
is
uncovering
a
system
of
peonage
established
under
cover
of
law
under
the
southern
program
it
is
sought
to
exclude
colored
men
from
every
grade
of
the
public
service
not
only
from
the
higher
administrative
functions
to
which
few
of
them
would
in
any
event
for
a
long
time
aspire
but
from
the
lowest
as
well
a
negro
may
not
be
a
constable
or
a
policeman
he
is
subjected
by
law
to
many
degrading
discriminations
he
is
required
to
be
separated
from
white
people
on
railroads
and
street
cars
and
by
custom
debarred
from
inns
and
places
of
public
entertainment
his
equal
right
to
a
free
public
education
is
constantly
threatened
and
is
nowhere
equitably
recognized
in
georgia
as
has
been
shown
by
du
bois
where
the
law
provides
for
a
pro
rata
distribution
of
the
public
school
fund
between
the
races
and
where
the
colored
school
population
is
per
cent
of
the
total
the
amount
of
the
fund
devoted
to
their
schools
is
only
per
cent
in
new
orleans
with
an
immense
colored
population
many
of
whom
are
persons
of
means
and
culture
all
colored
public
schools
above
the
fifth
grade
have
been
abolished
the
negro
is
subjected
to
taxation
without
representation
which
the
forefathers
of
this
republic
made
the
basis
of
a
bloody
revolution
flushed
with
their
local
success
and
encouraged
by
the
timidity
of
the
courts
and
the
indifference
of
public
opinion
the
southern
whites
have
carried
their
campaign
into
the
national
government
with
an
ominous
degree
of
success
if
they
shall
have
their
way
no
negro
can
fill
any
federal
office
or
occupy
in
the
public
service
any
position
that
is
not
menial
this
is
not
an
inference
but
the
openly
passionately
avowed
sentiment
of
the
white
south
the
right
to
employment
in
the
public
service
is
an
exceedingly
valuable
one
for
which
white
men
have
struggled
and
fought
a
vast
army
of
men
are
employed
in
the
administration
of
public
affairs
many
avenues
of
employment
are
closed
to
colored
men
by
popular
prejudice
if
their
right
to
public
employment
is
recognized
and
the
way
to
it
open
through
the
civil
service
or
the
appointing
power
or
the
suffrages
of
the
people
it
will
prove
as
it
has
already
a
strong
incentive
to
effort
and
a
powerful
lever
for
advancement
its
value
to
the
negro
like
that
of
the
right
to
vote
may
be
judged
by
the
eagerness
of
the
whites
to
deprive
him
of
it
not
only
is
the
negro
taxed
without
representation
in
the
states
referred
to
but
he
pays
through
the
tariff
and
internal
revenue
a
tax
to
a
national
government
whose
supreme
judicial
tribunal
declares
that
it
can
not
through
the
executive
arm
enforce
its
own
decrees
and
therefore
refuses
to
pass
upon
a
question
squarely
before
it
involving
a
basic
right
of
citizenship
for
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
the
giles
case
if
it
foreshadows
the
attitude
which
the
court
will
take
upon
other
cases
to
the
same
general
end
which
will
soon
come
before
it
is
scarcely
less
than
a
reaffirmation
of
the
dred
scott
decision
it
certainly
amounts
to
this
that
in
spite
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
colored
men
in
the
united
states
have
no
political
rights
which
the
states
are
bound
to
respect
to
say
this
much
is
to
say
that
all
privileges
and
immunities
which
negroes
henceforth
enjoy
must
be
by
favor
of
the
whites
they
are
not
the
whites
have
so
declared
they
proclaim
that
the
country
is
theirs
that
the
negro
should
be
thankful
that
he
has
so
much
when
so
much
more
might
be
withheld
from
him
he
stands
upon
a
lower
footing
than
any
alien
he
has
no
government
to
which
he
may
look
for
protection
moreover
the
white
south
sends
to
congress
on
a
basis
including
the
negro
population
a
delegation
nearly
twice
as
large
as
it
is
justly
entitled
to
and
one
which
may
always
safely
be
relied
upon
to
oppose
in
congress
every
measure
which
seeks
to
protect
the
equality
or
to
enlarge
the
rights
of
colored
citizens
the
grossness
of
this
injustice
is
all
the
more
apparent
since
the
supreme
court
in
the
alabama
case
referred
to
has
declared
the
legislative
and
political
department
of
the
government
to
be
the
only
power
which
can
right
a
political
wrong
under
this
decision
still
further
attacks
upon
the
liberties
of
the
citizen
may
be
confidently
expected
armed
with
the
negro
sole
weapon
of
defense
the
white
south
stands
ready
to
smite
down
his
rights
the
ballot
was
first
given
to
the
negro
to
defend
him
against
this
very
thing
he
needs
it
now
far
more
than
then
and
for
even
stronger
reasons
the
free
colored
people
of
to
day
have
vastly
more
to
defend
than
the
hapless
blacks
who
had
just
emerged
from
slavery
if
there
be
those
who
maintain
that
it
was
a
mistake
to
give
the
negro
the
ballot
at
the
time
and
in
the
manner
in
which
it
was
given
let
them
take
to
heart
this
reflection
that
to
deprive
him
of
it
or
to
so
restrict
it
as
to
leave
him
utterly
defenseless
against
the
present
relentless
attitude
of
the
south
toward
his
rights
will
prove
to
be
a
mistake
so
much
greater
than
the
first
as
to
be
no
less
than
a
crime
from
which
not
alone
the
southern
negro
must
suffer
but
for
which
the
nation
will
as
surely
pay
the
penalty
as
it
paid
for
the
crime
of
slavery
contempt
for
law
is
death
to
a
republic
and
this
one
has
developed
alarming
symptoms
of
the
disease
and
now
having
thus
robbed
the
negro
of
every
political
and
civil
the
white
south
in
palliation
of
its
course
makes
a
great
show
of
magnanimity
in
leaving
him
as
the
sole
remnant
of
what
he
acquired
through
the
civil
war
a
very
inadequate
public
school
education
which
by
the
present
program
is
to
be
directed
mainly
towards
making
him
a
better
agricultural
laborer
even
this
is
put
forward
as
a
favor
although
the
negro
property
is
taxed
to
pay
for
it
and
his
labor
as
well
for
it
is
a
well
settled
principle
of
political
economy
that
land
and
machinery
of
themselves
produce
nothing
and
that
labor
indirectly
pays
its
fair
proportion
of
the
tax
upon
the
public
wealth
the
white
south
seems
to
stand
to
the
negro
at
present
as
one
who
having
been
reluctantly
compelled
to
release
another
from
bondage
sees
him
stumbling
forward
and
upward
neglected
by
his
friends
and
scarcely
yet
conscious
of
his
own
strength
seizes
him
binds
him
and
having
bereft
him
of
speech
of
sight
and
of
manhood
yokes
him
with
the
mule
and
exclaims
with
a
show
of
virtue
which
ought
to
deceive
no
one
behold
how
good
a
friend
i
am
of
yours
have
i
not
left
you
a
stomach
and
a
pair
of
arms
and
will
i
not
generously
permit
you
to
work
for
me
with
the
one
that
you
may
thereby
gain
enough
to
fill
the
other
a
brain
you
do
not
need
we
will
relieve
you
of
any
responsibility
that
might
seem
to
demand
such
an
organ
the
argument
of
northern
white
men
and
negro
opportunists
that
the
political
power
of
the
negro
having
long
ago
been
suppressed
by
unlawful
means
his
right
to
vote
is
a
mere
paper
right
of
no
real
value
and
therefore
to
be
lightly
yielded
for
the
sake
of
a
hypothetical
harmony
is
fatally
it
is
precisely
the
attitude
and
essentially
the
argument
which
would
have
surrendered
to
the
south
in
the
sixties
and
would
have
left
this
country
to
rot
in
slavery
for
another
generation
white
men
do
not
thus
argue
concerning
their
own
rights
they
know
too
well
the
value
of
ideals
southern
white
men
see
too
clearly
the
latent
power
of
these
unexercised
rights
if
the
political
power
of
the
negro
was
a
nullity
because
of
his
ignorance
and
lack
of
leadership
why
were
they
not
content
to
leave
it
so
with
the
pleasing
assurance
that
if
it
ever
became
effective
it
would
be
because
the
negroes
had
grown
fit
for
its
exercise
on
the
contrary
they
have
not
rested
until
the
possibility
of
its
revival
was
apparently
headed
off
by
new
state
constitutions
nor
are
they
satisfied
with
this
there
is
no
doubt
that
an
effort
will
be
made
to
secure
the
repeal
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
thus
forestall
the
development
of
the
wealthy
and
educated
negro
whom
the
south
seems
to
anticipate
as
a
greater
menace
than
the
ignorant
however
improbable
this
repeal
may
seem
it
is
not
a
subject
to
be
lightly
dismissed
for
it
is
within
the
power
of
the
white
people
of
the
nation
to
do
whatever
they
wish
in
the
premises
they
did
it
once
they
can
do
it
again
the
negro
and
his
friends
should
see
to
it
that
the
white
majority
shall
never
wish
to
do
anything
to
his
hurt
there
still
stands
before
the
whites
of
the
south
the
specter
of
a
supreme
court
which
will
interpret
the
constitution
to
mean
what
it
says
and
what
those
who
enacted
it
meant
and
what
the
nation
which
ratified
it
understood
and
which
will
find
power
in
a
nation
which
goes
beyond
seas
to
administer
the
affairs
of
distant
peoples
to
enforce
its
own
fundamental
laws
the
specter
too
of
an
aroused
public
opinion
which
will
compel
congress
and
the
courts
to
preserve
the
liberties
of
the
republic
which
are
the
liberties
of
the
people
to
wilfully
neglect
the
suffrage
to
hold
it
lightly
is
to
tamper
with
a
sacred
right
to
yield
it
for
anything
else
whatever
is
simply
suicidal
dropping
the
element
of
race
disfranchisement
is
no
more
than
to
say
to
the
poor
and
poorly
taught
that
they
must
relinquish
the
right
to
defend
themselves
against
oppression
until
they
shall
have
become
rich
and
learned
in
competition
with
those
already
thus
favored
and
possessing
the
ballot
in
addition
this
is
not
the
philosophy
of
history
the
growth
of
liberty
has
been
the
constant
struggle
of
the
poor
against
the
privileged
classes
and
the
goal
of
that
struggle
has
ever
been
the
equality
of
all
men
before
the
law
the
negro
who
would
yield
this
right
deserves
to
be
a
slave
he
has
the
servile
spirit
the
rich
and
the
educated
can
by
virtue
of
their
influence
command
many
votes
can
find
other
means
of
protection
the
poor
man
has
but
one
he
should
guard
it
as
a
sacred
treasure
long
ago
by
fair
treatment
the
white
leaders
of
the
south
might
have
bound
the
negro
to
themselves
with
hoops
of
steel
they
have
not
chosen
to
take
this
course
but
by
assuming
from
the
beginning
an
attitude
hostile
to
his
rights
have
never
gained
his
confidence
and
now
seek
by
foul
means
to
destroy
where
they
have
never
sought
by
fair
means
to
control
i
have
spoken
of
the
effect
of
disfranchisement
upon
the
colored
race
it
is
to
the
race
as
a
whole
that
the
argument
of
the
problem
is
generally
directed
but
the
unit
of
society
in
a
republic
is
the
individual
and
not
the
race
the
failure
to
recognize
this
fact
being
the
fundamental
error
which
has
beclouded
the
whole
discussion
the
effect
of
disfranchisement
upon
the
individual
is
scarcely
less
disastrous
i
do
not
speak
of
the
moral
effect
of
injustice
upon
those
who
suffer
from
it
i
refer
rather
to
the
practical
consequences
which
may
be
appreciated
by
any
mind
no
country
is
free
in
which
the
way
upward
is
not
open
for
every
man
to
try
and
for
every
properly
qualified
man
to
attain
whatever
of
good
the
community
life
may
offer
such
a
condition
does
not
exist
at
the
south
even
in
theory
for
any
man
of
color
in
no
career
can
such
a
man
compete
with
white
men
upon
equal
terms
he
must
not
only
meet
the
prejudice
of
the
individual
not
only
the
united
prejudice
of
the
white
community
but
lest
some
one
should
wish
to
treat
him
fairly
he
is
met
at
every
turn
with
some
legal
prohibition
which
says
thou
shalt
not
or
thus
far
shalt
thou
go
and
no
farther
but
the
negro
race
is
viable
it
adapts
itself
readily
to
circumstances
and
being
thus
adaptable
there
is
always
the
temptation
to
crook
the
pregnant
hinges
of
the
knee
where
thrift
may
follow
fawning
he
who
can
most
skillfully
balance
himself
upon
the
advancing
or
receding
wave
of
white
opinion
concerning
his
race
is
surest
of
such
measure
of
prosperity
as
is
permitted
to
men
of
dark
skins
there
are
negro
teachers
in
the
south
the
privilege
of
teaching
in
their
own
schools
is
the
one
respectable
branch
of
the
public
service
still
left
open
to
them
who
for
a
grudging
appropriation
from
a
southern
legislature
will
decry
their
own
race
approve
their
own
degradation
and
laud
their
oppressors
deprived
of
the
right
to
vote
and
therefore
of
any
power
to
demand
what
is
their
due
they
feel
impelled
to
buy
the
tolerance
of
the
whites
at
any
sacrifice
if
to
live
is
the
first
duty
of
man
as
perhaps
it
is
the
first
instinct
then
those
who
thus
stoop
to
conquer
may
be
right
but
is
it
needful
to
stoop
so
low
and
if
so
where
lies
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
this
abasement
i
shall
say
nothing
about
the
moral
effect
of
disfranchisement
upon
the
white
people
or
upon
the
state
itself
what
slavery
made
of
the
southern
whites
is
a
matter
of
history
the
abolition
of
slavery
gave
the
south
an
opportunity
to
emerge
from
barbarism
present
conditions
indicate
that
the
spirit
which
dominated
slavery
still
curses
the
fair
section
over
which
that
institution
spread
its
blight
and
now
is
the
situation
remediless
if
not
so
where
lies
the
remedy
first
let
us
take
up
those
remedies
suggested
by
the
men
who
approve
of
disfranchisement
though
they
may
sometimes
deplore
the
method
or
regret
the
necessity
time
we
are
told
heals
all
diseases
rights
all
wrongs
and
is
the
only
cure
for
this
one
it
is
a
cowardly
argument
these
people
are
entitled
to
their
rights
while
they
are
yet
alive
to
enjoy
them
and
it
is
poor
statesmanship
and
worse
morals
to
nurse
a
present
evil
and
thrust
it
forward
upon
a
future
generation
for
correction
the
nation
can
no
more
honestly
do
this
than
it
could
thrust
back
upon
a
past
generation
the
responsibility
for
slavery
it
had
to
meet
that
responsibility
it
ought
to
meet
this
one
education
has
been
put
forward
as
the
great
corrective
preferably
industrial
education
the
intellect
of
the
whites
is
to
be
educated
to
the
point
where
they
will
so
appreciate
the
blessings
of
liberty
and
equality
as
of
their
own
motion
to
enlarge
and
defend
the
rights
the
negroes
on
the
other
hand
are
to
be
so
trained
as
to
make
them
not
equal
with
the
whites
in
any
way
god
save
the
mark
this
would
be
unthinkable
but
so
useful
to
the
community
that
the
whites
will
protect
them
rather
than
lose
their
valuable
services
some
few
enthusiasts
go
so
far
as
to
maintain
that
by
virtue
of
education
the
negro
will
in
time
become
strong
enough
to
protect
himself
against
any
aggression
of
the
whites
this
it
may
be
said
is
a
strictly
northern
view
it
is
not
quite
clearly
apparent
how
education
alone
in
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
is
to
solve
in
any
appreciable
time
the
problem
of
the
relations
of
southern
white
and
black
people
the
need
of
education
of
all
kinds
for
both
races
is
wofully
apparent
but
men
and
nations
have
been
free
without
being
learned
and
there
have
been
educated
slaves
liberty
has
been
known
to
languish
where
culture
had
reached
a
very
high
development
nations
do
not
first
become
rich
and
learned
and
then
free
but
the
lesson
of
history
has
been
that
they
first
become
free
and
then
rich
and
learned
and
oftentimes
fall
back
into
slavery
again
because
of
too
great
wealth
and
the
resulting
luxury
and
carelessness
of
civic
virtues
the
process
of
education
has
been
going
on
rapidly
in
the
southern
states
since
the
civil
war
and
yet
if
we
take
superficial
indications
the
rights
of
the
negroes
are
at
a
lower
ebb
than
at
any
time
during
the
years
of
their
freedom
and
the
race
prejudice
more
intense
and
uncompromising
it
is
not
apparent
that
educated
southerners
are
less
rancorous
than
others
in
their
speech
concerning
the
negro
or
less
hostile
in
their
attitude
toward
his
rights
it
is
their
voice
alone
that
we
have
heard
in
this
discussion
and
if
as
they
state
they
are
liberal
in
their
views
as
compared
with
the
more
ignorant
whites
then
god
save
the
negro
i
was
told
in
so
many
words
two
years
ago
by
the
superintendent
of
public
schools
of
a
southern
city
that
there
was
no
place
in
the
modern
world
for
the
negro
except
under
the
ground
if
gentlemen
holding
such
opinions
are
to
instruct
the
white
youth
of
the
south
would
it
be
at
all
surprising
if
these
later
on
should
devote
a
portion
of
their
leisure
to
the
improvement
of
civilization
by
putting
under
the
ground
as
many
of
this
superfluous
race
as
possible
the
sole
excuse
made
in
the
south
for
the
prevalent
injustice
to
the
negro
is
the
difference
in
race
and
the
inequalities
and
antipathies
resulting
therefrom
it
has
nowhere
been
declared
as
a
part
of
the
southern
program
that
the
negro
when
educated
is
to
be
given
a
fair
representation
in
government
or
an
equal
opportunity
in
life
the
contrary
has
been
strenuously
asserted
education
can
never
make
of
him
anything
but
a
negro
and
therefore
essentially
inferior
and
not
to
be
safely
trusted
with
any
degree
of
power
a
system
of
education
which
would
tend
to
soften
the
asperities
and
lessen
the
inequalities
between
the
races
would
be
of
inestimable
value
an
education
which
by
a
rigid
separation
of
the
races
from
the
kindergarten
to
the
university
fosters
this
racial
antipathy
and
is
directed
toward
emphasizing
the
superiority
of
one
class
and
the
inferiority
of
another
might
easily
have
disastrous
rather
than
beneficial
results
it
would
render
the
oppressing
class
more
powerful
to
injure
the
oppressed
quicker
to
perceive
and
keener
to
resent
the
injury
without
proportionate
power
of
defense
the
same
assimilative
education
which
is
given
at
the
north
to
all
children
alike
whereby
native
and
foreign
black
and
white
are
taught
side
by
side
in
every
grade
of
instruction
and
are
compelled
by
the
exigencies
of
discipline
to
keep
their
prejudices
in
abeyance
and
are
given
the
opportunity
to
learn
and
appreciate
one
another
good
qualities
and
to
establish
friendly
relations
which
may
exist
throughout
life
is
absent
from
the
southern
system
of
education
both
of
the
past
and
as
proposed
for
the
future
education
is
in
a
broad
sense
a
remedy
for
all
social
ills
but
the
disease
we
have
to
deal
with
now
is
not
only
constitutional
but
acute
a
wise
physician
does
not
simply
give
a
tonic
for
a
diseased
limb
or
a
high
fever
the
patient
might
be
dead
before
the
constitutional
remedy
could
become
effective
the
evils
of
slavery
its
injury
to
whites
and
blacks
and
to
the
body
politic
were
clearly
perceived
and
acknowledged
by
the
educated
leaders
of
the
south
as
far
back
as
the
revolutionary
war
and
the
constitutional
convention
and
yet
they
made
no
effort
to
abolish
it
their
remedy
was
the
same
time
education
social
and
economic
development
and
yet
a
bloody
war
was
necessary
to
destroy
slavery
and
put
its
spirit
temporarily
to
sleep
when
the
south
and
its
friends
are
ready
to
propose
a
system
of
education
which
will
recognize
and
teach
the
equality
of
all
men
before
the
law
the
potency
of
education
alone
to
settle
the
race
problem
will
be
more
clearly
apparent
at
present
even
good
northern
men
who
wish
to
educate
the
negroes
feel
impelled
to
buy
this
privilege
from
the
none
too
eager
white
south
by
conceding
away
the
civil
and
political
rights
of
those
whom
they
would
benefit
they
have
indeed
gone
farther
than
the
southerners
themselves
in
approving
the
disfranchisement
of
the
colored
race
most
southern
men
now
that
they
have
carried
their
point
and
disfranchised
the
negro
are
willing
to
admit
in
the
language
of
a
recent
number
of
the
charleston
that
the
attitude
of
the
southern
white
man
toward
the
negro
is
incompatible
with
the
fundamental
ideas
of
the
republic
it
remained
for
our
clevelands
and
abbotts
and
parkhursts
to
assure
them
that
their
unlawful
course
was
right
and
justifiable
and
for
the
most
distinguished
negro
leader
to
declare
that
every
revised
constitution
throughout
the
southern
states
has
put
a
premium
upon
intelligence
ownership
of
property
thrift
and
character
so
does
every
penitentiary
sentence
put
a
premium
upon
good
conduct
but
it
is
poor
consolation
to
the
one
unjustly
condemned
to
be
told
that
he
may
shorten
his
sentence
somewhat
by
good
behavior
booker
washington
whose
language
is
quoted
above
has
by
his
eminent
services
in
the
cause
of
education
won
deserved
renown
if
he
has
seemed
at
times
to
those
jealous
of
the
best
things
for
their
race
to
decry
the
higher
education
it
can
easily
be
borne
in
mind
that
his
career
is
bound
up
in
the
success
of
an
industrial
school
hence
any
undue
stress
which
he
may
put
upon
that
branch
of
education
may
safely
be
ascribed
to
the
natural
zeal
of
the
promoter
without
detracting
in
any
degree
from
the
essential
value
of
his
teachings
in
favor
of
manual
training
thrift
and
but
washington
prominence
as
an
educational
leader
among
a
race
whose
prominent
leaders
are
so
few
has
at
times
forced
him
perhaps
reluctantly
to
express
himself
in
regard
to
the
political
condition
of
his
people
and
here
his
utterances
have
not
always
been
so
wise
nor
so
happy
he
has
declared
himself
in
favor
of
a
restricted
suffrage
which
at
present
means
for
his
own
people
nothing
less
than
complete
loss
of
representation
indeed
it
is
only
in
that
connection
that
the
question
has
been
seriously
mooted
and
he
has
advised
them
to
go
slow
in
seeking
to
enforce
their
civil
and
political
rights
which
in
effect
means
silent
submission
to
injustice
southern
white
men
may
applaud
this
advice
as
wise
because
it
fits
in
with
their
purposes
but
senator
mcenery
of
louisiana
in
a
recent
article
in
the
voices
the
southern
white
opinion
of
such
acquiescence
when
he
says
what
other
race
would
have
submitted
so
many
years
to
slavery
without
complaint
other
race
would
have
submitted
so
quietly
to
disfranchisement
these
facts
stamp
his
the
negro
inferiority
to
the
white
race
the
time
to
philosophize
about
the
good
there
is
in
evil
is
not
while
its
correction
is
still
possible
but
if
at
all
after
all
hope
of
correction
is
past
until
then
it
calls
for
nothing
but
rigorous
condemnation
to
try
to
read
any
good
thing
into
these
fraudulent
southern
constitutions
or
to
accept
them
as
an
accomplished
fact
is
to
condone
a
crime
against
one
race
those
who
commit
crime
should
bear
the
odium
it
is
not
a
pleasing
spectacle
to
see
the
robbed
applaud
the
robber
silence
were
better
it
has
become
fashionable
to
question
the
wisdom
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
i
believe
it
to
have
been
an
act
of
the
highest
statesmanship
based
upon
the
fundamental
idea
of
this
republic
entirely
justified
by
conditions
experimental
in
its
nature
perhaps
as
every
new
thing
must
be
but
just
in
principle
a
choice
between
methods
of
which
it
seemed
to
the
great
statesmen
of
that
epoch
the
wisest
and
the
best
and
essentially
the
most
just
bearing
in
mind
the
interests
of
the
freedmen
and
the
nation
as
well
as
the
feelings
of
the
southern
whites
never
fairly
tried
and
therefore
not
yet
to
be
justly
condemned
not
one
of
those
who
condemn
it
has
been
able
even
in
the
light
of
subsequent
events
to
suggest
a
better
method
by
which
the
liberty
and
civil
rights
of
the
freedmen
and
their
descendants
could
have
been
protected
its
abandonment
as
i
have
shown
leaves
this
liberty
and
these
rights
frankly
without
any
guaranteed
protection
all
the
education
which
philanthropy
or
the
state
could
offer
as
a
for
equality
of
rights
would
be
a
poor
exchange
there
is
no
defensible
reason
why
they
should
not
go
hand
in
hand
each
encouraging
and
strengthening
the
other
the
education
which
one
can
demand
as
a
right
is
likely
to
do
more
good
than
the
education
for
which
one
must
sue
as
a
favor
the
chief
argument
against
negro
suffrage
the
insistently
proclaimed
argument
worn
threadbare
in
congress
on
the
platform
in
the
pulpit
in
the
press
in
poetry
in
fiction
in
impassioned
rhetoric
is
the
reconstruction
period
and
yet
the
evils
of
that
period
were
due
far
more
to
the
venality
and
indifference
of
white
men
than
to
the
incapacity
of
black
voters
the
revised
southern
constitutions
adopted
under
reconstruction
reveal
a
higher
statesmanship
than
any
which
preceded
or
have
followed
them
and
prove
that
the
freed
voters
could
as
easily
have
been
led
into
the
paths
of
civic
righteousness
as
into
those
of
misgovernment
certain
it
is
that
under
reconstruction
the
civil
and
political
rights
of
all
men
were
more
secure
in
those
states
than
they
have
ever
been
since
we
will
hear
less
of
the
evils
of
reconstruction
now
that
the
bugaboo
has
served
its
purpose
by
disfranchising
the
negro
it
will
be
laid
aside
for
a
time
while
the
nation
discusses
the
political
corruption
of
great
cities
the
scandalous
conditions
in
rhode
island
the
evils
attending
reconstruction
in
the
philippines
and
the
scandals
in
the
postoffice
department
for
none
of
which
by
the
way
is
the
negro
charged
with
any
responsibility
and
for
none
of
which
is
the
restriction
of
the
suffrage
a
remedy
seriously
proposed
rhode
island
is
indeed
the
only
northern
state
which
has
a
property
qualification
for
the
franchise
there
are
three
tribunals
to
which
the
colored
people
may
justly
appeal
for
the
protection
of
their
rights
the
united
states
courts
congress
and
public
opinion
at
present
all
three
seem
mainly
indifferent
to
any
question
of
human
rights
under
the
constitution
indeed
congress
and
the
courts
merely
follow
public
opinion
seldom
lead
it
congress
never
enacts
a
measure
which
is
believed
to
oppose
public
opinion
your
congressman
keeps
his
ear
to
the
ground
the
high
serene
atmosphere
of
the
courts
is
not
impervious
to
its
voice
they
rarely
enforce
a
law
contrary
to
public
opinion
even
the
supreme
court
being
able
as
charles
sumner
once
put
it
to
find
a
reason
for
every
decision
it
may
wish
to
render
or
as
experience
has
shown
a
method
to
evade
any
question
which
it
can
not
decently
decide
in
accordance
with
public
opinion
the
art
of
straddling
is
not
confined
to
the
political
arena
the
southern
situation
has
been
well
described
by
a
colored
editor
in
richmond
when
we
seek
relief
at
the
hands
of
congress
we
are
informed
that
our
plea
involves
a
legal
question
and
we
are
referred
to
the
courts
when
we
appeal
to
the
courts
we
are
gravely
told
that
the
question
is
a
political
one
and
that
we
must
go
to
congress
when
congress
enacts
remedial
legislation
our
enemies
take
it
to
the
supreme
court
which
promptly
declares
it
unconstitutional
the
negro
might
chase
his
rights
round
and
round
this
circle
until
the
end
of
time
without
finding
any
relief
yet
the
constitution
is
clear
and
unequivocal
in
its
terms
and
no
supreme
court
can
indefinitely
continue
to
construe
it
as
meaning
anything
but
what
it
says
this
court
should
be
bombarded
with
suits
until
it
makes
some
definite
pronouncement
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
broad
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
disfranchising
constitutions
of
the
southern
states
the
negro
and
his
friends
will
then
have
a
issue
to
take
to
the
forum
of
public
opinion
and
a
distinct
ground
upon
which
to
demand
legislation
for
the
enforcement
of
the
federal
constitution
the
case
from
alabama
was
carried
to
the
supreme
court
expressly
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
the
alabama
constitution
the
court
declared
itself
without
jurisdiction
and
in
the
same
breath
went
into
the
merits
of
the
case
far
enough
to
deny
relief
without
passing
upon
the
real
issue
had
it
said
as
it
might
with
absolute
justice
and
perfect
propriety
that
the
alabama
constitution
is
a
bold
and
impudent
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
the
purpose
of
the
lawsuit
would
have
been
accomplished
and
a
righteous
cause
vastly
strengthened
but
public
opinion
can
not
remain
permanently
indifferent
to
so
vital
a
question
the
agitation
is
already
on
it
is
at
present
largely
academic
but
is
slowly
and
resistlessly
forcing
itself
into
politics
which
is
the
medium
through
which
republics
settle
such
questions
it
can
not
much
longer
be
contemptuously
or
indifferently
elbowed
aside
the
south
itself
seems
bent
upon
forcing
the
question
to
an
issue
as
by
its
arrogant
assumptions
it
brought
on
the
civil
war
from
that
section
too
there
come
now
and
then
side
by
side
with
tales
of
southern
outrage
excusing
voices
which
at
the
same
time
are
accusing
voices
which
admit
that
the
white
south
is
dealing
with
the
negro
unjustly
and
unwisely
that
the
golden
rule
has
been
forgotten
that
the
interests
of
white
men
alone
have
been
taken
into
account
and
that
their
true
interests
as
well
are
being
sacrificed
there
is
a
silent
white
south
uneasy
in
conscience
darkened
in
counsel
groping
for
the
light
and
willing
to
do
the
right
they
are
as
yet
a
feeble
folk
their
voices
scarcely
audible
above
the
clamor
of
the
mob
may
their
convictions
ripen
into
wisdom
and
may
their
numbers
and
their
courage
increase
if
the
class
of
southern
white
men
of
whom
judge
jones
of
alabama
is
so
noble
a
representative
are
supported
and
encouraged
by
a
righteous
public
opinion
at
the
north
they
may
in
time
become
the
dominant
white
south
and
we
may
then
look
for
wisdom
and
justice
in
the
place
where
so
far
as
the
negro
is
concerned
they
now
seem
strangers
but
even
these
gentlemen
will
do
well
to
bear
in
mind
that
so
long
as
they
discriminate
in
any
way
against
the
negro
equality
of
right
so
long
do
they
set
class
against
class
and
open
the
door
to
every
sort
of
discrimination
there
can
be
no
middle
ground
between
justice
and
injustice
between
the
citizen
and
the
serf
it
is
not
likely
that
the
north
upon
the
sober
second
thought
will
permit
the
results
of
the
civil
war
to
be
nullified
by
any
change
in
the
constitution
so
long
as
the
fifteenth
amendment
stands
the
of
colored
citizens
are
ultimately
secure
there
were
despots
in
england
after
the
granting
of
magna
charta
but
it
outlived
them
all
and
the
liberties
of
the
english
people
are
secure
there
was
slavery
in
this
land
after
the
declaration
of
independence
yet
the
faces
of
those
who
love
liberty
have
ever
turned
to
that
immortal
document
so
will
the
constitution
and
its
principles
outlive
the
prejudices
which
would
seek
to
overthrow
it
what
colored
men
of
the
south
can
do
to
secure
their
citizenship
or
in
the
immediate
future
is
not
very
clear
their
utterances
on
political
questions
unless
they
be
to
concede
away
the
political
rights
of
their
race
or
to
soothe
the
consciences
of
white
men
by
suggesting
that
the
problem
is
insoluble
except
by
some
slow
remedial
process
which
will
become
effectual
only
in
the
distant
future
are
received
with
scant
respect
could
scarcely
indeed
be
otherwise
received
without
a
voting
constituency
to
back
them
up
and
must
be
cautiously
made
lest
they
meet
an
actively
hostile
reception
but
there
are
many
colored
men
at
the
north
where
their
civil
and
political
rights
in
the
main
are
respected
there
every
honest
man
has
a
vote
which
he
may
freely
cast
and
which
is
reasonably
sure
to
be
fairly
counted
when
this
race
develops
a
sufficient
power
of
combination
under
adequate
leadership
and
there
are
signs
already
that
this
time
is
near
at
hand
the
northern
vote
can
be
wielded
irresistibly
for
the
defense
of
the
rights
of
their
southern
brethren
in
the
meantime
the
northern
colored
men
have
the
right
of
free
speech
and
they
should
never
cease
to
demand
their
rights
to
clamor
for
them
to
guard
them
jealously
and
insistently
to
invoke
law
and
public
sentiment
to
maintain
them
he
who
would
be
free
must
learn
to
protect
his
freedom
eternal
vigilance
is
the
price
of
liberty
he
who
would
be
respected
must
respect
himself
the
best
friend
of
the
negro
is
he
who
would
rather
see
within
the
borders
of
this
republic
one
million
free
citizens
of
that
race
equal
before
the
law
than
ten
million
cringing
serfs
existing
by
a
contemptuous
sufferance
a
race
that
is
willing
to
survive
upon
any
other
terms
is
scarcely
worthy
of
consideration
the
direct
remedy
for
the
disfranchisement
of
the
negro
lies
through
political
action
one
scarcely
sees
the
philosophy
of
distinguishing
between
a
civil
and
a
political
right
but
the
supreme
court
has
recognized
this
distinction
and
has
designated
congress
as
the
power
to
right
a
political
wrong
the
fifteenth
amendment
gives
congress
power
to
enforce
its
provisions
the
power
would
seem
to
be
inherent
in
government
itself
but
anticipating
that
the
enforcement
of
the
amendment
might
involve
difficulty
they
made
the
supererogatory
declaration
moreover
they
went
further
and
passed
laws
by
which
they
provided
for
such
enforcement
these
the
supreme
court
has
so
far
declared
insufficient
it
is
for
congress
to
make
more
laws
it
is
for
colored
men
and
for
white
men
who
are
not
content
to
see
the
results
of
the
civil
war
nullified
to
urge
and
direct
public
opinion
to
the
point
where
it
will
demand
stringent
legislation
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
this
demand
will
rest
in
law
in
morals
and
in
true
statesmanship
no
difficulties
attending
it
could
be
worse
than
the
present
ignoble
attitude
of
the
nation
toward
its
own
laws
and
its
own
ideals
without
courage
to
enforce
them
without
conscience
to
change
them
the
united
states
presents
the
spectacle
of
a
nation
drifting
aimlessly
so
far
as
this
vital
national
problem
is
concerned
upon
the
sea
of
irresolution
toward
the
maelstrom
of
anarchy
the
right
of
congress
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
reduce
southern
representation
can
hardly
be
disputed
but
congress
has
a
simpler
and
more
direct
method
to
accomplish
the
same
end
it
is
the
sole
judge
of
the
qualifications
of
its
own
members
and
the
sole
judge
of
whether
any
member
presenting
his
credentials
has
met
those
qualifications
it
can
refuse
to
seat
any
member
who
comes
from
a
district
where
voters
have
been
disfranchised
it
can
judge
for
itself
whether
this
has
been
done
and
there
is
no
appeal
from
its
decision
if
when
it
has
passed
a
law
any
court
shall
refuse
to
obey
its
behests
it
can
impeach
the
judges
if
any
president
refuse
to
lend
the
executive
arm
of
the
government
to
the
enforcement
of
the
law
it
can
impeach
the
president
no
such
extreme
measures
are
likely
to
be
necessary
for
the
enforcement
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
and
the
thirteenth
which
is
also
threatened
but
they
are
mentioned
as
showing
that
congress
is
supreme
and
congress
proceeds
the
house
directly
the
senate
indirectly
from
the
people
and
is
governed
by
public
opinion
if
the
reduction
of
southern
representation
were
to
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
bargain
by
which
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
surrendered
then
it
might
prove
fatal
to
liberty
if
it
be
inflicted
as
a
punishment
and
a
warning
to
be
followed
by
more
drastic
measures
if
not
sufficient
it
would
serve
a
useful
purpose
the
fifteenth
amendment
declares
that
the
right
to
vote
be
denied
or
abridged
on
account
of
color
and
any
measure
adopted
by
congress
should
look
to
that
end
only
as
the
power
to
injure
the
negro
in
congress
is
reduced
thereby
would
a
reduction
of
representation
protect
the
negro
without
other
measures
it
would
still
leave
him
in
the
hands
of
the
southern
whites
who
could
safely
be
trusted
to
make
him
pay
for
their
humiliation
finally
there
is
somewhere
in
the
universe
a
power
that
works
for
righteousness
and
that
leads
men
to
do
justice
to
one
another
to
this
power
working
upon
the
hearts
and
consciences
of
men
the
negro
can
always
appeal
he
has
the
right
upon
his
side
and
in
the
end
the
right
will
prevail
the
negro
will
in
time
attain
to
full
manhood
and
citizenship
throughout
the
united
states
no
better
guaranty
of
this
is
needed
than
a
comparison
of
his
present
with
his
past
toward
this
he
must
do
his
part
as
lies
within
his
power
and
his
opportunity
but
it
will
be
after
all
largely
a
white
man
conflict
fought
out
in
the
forum
of
the
public
conscience
the
negro
though
eager
enough
when
opportunity
offered
had
comparatively
little
to
do
with
the
abolition
of
slavery
which
was
a
vastly
more
formidable
task
than
will
be
the
enforcement
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
negro
