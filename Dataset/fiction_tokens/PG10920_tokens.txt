two

introductory
it
may
seem
a
somewhat
irish
method
of
beginning
the
story
of
two
years
ago
by
a
scene
which
happened
but
a
month
since
and
yet
will
not
the
story
be
on
that
very
account
a
better
type
of
many
a
own
experiences
how
few
of
us
had
learnt
the
meaning
of
two
years
ago
until
this
late
quiet
autumn
time
and
till
christmas
too
with
its
gaps
in
the
old
ring
of
friendly
faces
never
to
be
filled
up
again
on
earth
began
to
teach
us
somewhat
of
its
lesson
two
years
ago
while
pestilence
was
hovering
over
us
and
ours
while
the
was
ringing
in
our
ears
who
had
time
to
think
to
ask
what
all
that
meant
to
seek
for
the
deep
lesson
which
we
knew
must
lie
beneath
two
years
ago
was
the
time
for
work
for
men
to
do
with
all
their
might
whatsoever
their
hands
found
to
do
but
now
the
storm
has
lulled
once
more
the
air
has
cleared
awhile
and
we
can
talk
calmly
over
all
the
wonders
of
that
sudden
strange
and
sad
two
years
ago
so
felt
at
least
two
friends
who
went
down
just
one
week
before
to
whitbury
in
berkshire
two
years
ago
had
come
to
one
of
them
as
to
thousands
more
the
crisis
of
his
life
and
he
was
talking
of
it
with
his
companion
and
was
on
his
way
too
to
learn
more
of
that
story
which
this
book
contains
and
in
which
he
had
borne
his
part
they
were
both
of
them
men
who
would
at
first
sight
interest
a
stranger
the
shorter
of
the
two
he
might
have
seen
before
at
picture
sales
royal
academy
meetings
dinner
parties
evening
parties
anywhere
and
everywhere
in
town
for
claude
mellot
is
a
general
favourite
and
a
general
guest
he
is
a
tiny
man
with
a
look
of
enthusiasm
about
his
beautiful
face
which
reminds
you
much
of
shelley
portrait
only
he
has
what
shelley
had
not
clustering
auburn
curls
and
a
rich
brown
beard
soft
as
silk
you
set
him
down
at
once
as
a
man
of
delicate
susceptibility
sweetness
thoughtfulness
probably
as
he
actually
is
an
artist
his
companion
is
a
man
of
statelier
stamp
tall
dark
and
handsome
with
a
very
large
forehead
if
the
face
has
a
fault
it
is
that
the
mouth
is
too
small
that
and
the
expression
of
face
too
and
the
tone
of
voice
seem
to
indicate
possibly
a
too
aristocratic
exclusiveness
he
is
dressed
like
a
very
fine
gentleman
indeed
and
looks
and
talks
like
one
aristocrat
however
in
the
common
sense
of
the
word
he
is
not
for
he
is
a
native
of
the
model
republic
and
in
a
great
new
york
merchant
firm
he
is
chatting
away
to
claude
mellot
the
artist
about
election
and
on
that
point
seems
to
be
earnest
enough
though
patient
and
moderate
my
dear
claude
our
loss
is
gain
the
delay
of
the
next
four
years
was
really
necessary
that
we
might
consolidate
our
party
and
i
leave
you
to
judge
if
it
has
grown
to
its
present
size
in
but
a
few
months
what
dimensions
it
will
have
attained
before
the
next
election
we
require
the
delay
too
to
discover
who
are
our
really
best
men
not
merely
as
orators
but
as
workers
and
you
english
ought
to
know
better
than
any
nation
that
the
latter
class
of
men
are
those
whom
the
world
most
needs
that
though
aaron
may
be
an
altogether
inspired
preacher
yet
it
is
only
practical
moses
whose
spokesman
he
is
who
can
deliver
israel
from
their
taskmasters
besides
my
dear
fellow
we
really
want
the
next
four
years
it
not
in
gath
to
look
about
us
and
see
what
is
to
be
done
your
wisest
englishmen
justly
complain
of
us
that
our
is
as
yet
a
merely
negative
one
that
we
define
what
the
south
shall
not
do
but
not
what
the
north
shall
ere
four
years
be
over
we
will
have
a
platform
at
which
you
shall
have
no
cause
to
grumble
i
still
think
with
marie
that
your
platform
is
already
made
for
you
plain
as
the
sun
in
heaven
as
the
lightnings
of
sinai
free
those
slaves
at
once
and
utterly
impatient
idealist
by
what
means
by
law
or
by
force
leave
us
to
draw
a
round
the
tainted
states
and
leave
the
system
to
die
a
natural
death
as
it
rapidly
will
if
it
be
prevented
from
enlarging
its
field
do
fancy
that
a
dream
of
mine
none
know
it
better
than
the
southerners
themselves
what
makes
them
ready
just
now
to
risk
honour
justice
even
the
common
law
of
nations
and
humanity
in
the
struggle
for
new
slave
territory
what
but
the
consciousness
that
without
virgin
soil
which
will
yield
rapid
and
enormous
profit
to
slave
labour
they
and
their
institution
must
be
ruined
the
more
reason
for
accelerating
so
desirable
a
consummation
by
freeing
the
slaves
at
once
humph
said
stangrave
with
a
smile
who
so
cruel
at
times
as
your
too
benevolent
philanthropist
did
you
ever
count
the
meaning
of
those
words
disruption
of
the
union
an
invasion
of
the
south
by
the
north
and
an
internecine
war
aggravated
by
the
horrors
of
a
general
rising
of
the
slaves
and
such
scenes
as
hayti
beheld
sixty
years
ago
if
you
have
ever
read
them
you
will
pause
ere
you
determine
to
repeat
them
on
a
vaster
scale
it
is
dreadful
heaven
knows
even
in
thought
but
stangrave
can
any
moderation
on
your
part
ward
it
off
where
there
is
crime
there
is
vengeance
and
without
shedding
of
blood
is
no
remission
of
sin
god
knows
it
may
be
true
but
god
forbid
that
i
should
ever
do
aught
to
hasten
what
may
come
oh
claude
do
you
fancy
that
i
of
all
men
do
not
feel
at
moments
the
thirst
for
brute
vengeance
claude
was
silent
judge
for
yourself
you
who
know
all
what
man
among
us
northerners
can
feel
as
i
do
what
those
hapless
men
may
have
deserved
i
who
have
day
and
night
before
me
the
brand
of
their
cruelty
filling
my
heart
with
fire
i
need
all
my
strength
all
my
reason
at
times
to
say
to
myself
as
i
say
to
others
not
these
slaveholders
men
of
like
passions
with
yourself
what
have
they
done
which
you
would
not
have
done
in
their
place
i
have
never
read
that
key
to
uncle
cabin
i
will
not
even
read
this
dred
admirable
as
i
believe
it
to
be
why
should
you
said
claude
have
you
not
a
key
to
uncle
cabin
more
pathetic
than
any
word
of
man
or
woman
but
i
do
not
mean
that
i
will
not
read
them
because
i
have
the
key
to
them
in
my
own
heart
claude
because
conscience
has
taught
me
to
feel
for
the
southerner
as
a
brother
who
is
but
what
i
might
have
been
and
to
sigh
over
his
misdirected
courage
and
energy
not
with
hatred
not
with
contempt
but
with
pity
all
the
more
intense
the
more
he
scorns
that
pity
to
long
not
merely
for
the
slaves
sake
but
for
the
masters
sake
to
see
them
the
once
chivalrous
gentlemen
of
the
south
delivered
from
the
meshes
of
a
net
which
they
did
not
spread
for
themselves
but
which
was
round
their
feet
and
round
their
fathers
from
the
day
that
they
were
born
you
ask
me
to
destroy
these
men
i
long
to
save
them
from
their
certain
doom
you
are
right
and
a
better
christian
than
i
am
i
believe
certainly
they
do
need
pity
if
any
sinners
do
for
slavery
seems
to
be
to
judge
from
brooks
triumph
a
great
moral
curse
and
a
heavier
degradation
to
the
slaveholder
himself
than
it
can
ever
be
to
the
slave
then
i
would
free
them
from
that
curse
that
degradation
if
the
negro
asks
i
not
a
man
and
a
brother
have
they
no
right
to
ask
it
also
shall
i
pretending
to
love
my
country
venture
on
any
rash
step
which
may
shut
out
the
whole
southern
white
population
from
their
share
in
my
country
future
glory
no
have
but
patience
with
us
you
comfortable
liberals
of
the
old
world
who
find
freedom
ready
made
to
your
hands
and
we
will
pay
you
all
remember
we
are
but
children
yet
our
sins
are
the
sins
of
youth
greediness
intemperance
petulance
when
we
are
purged
from
our
youthful
sins
england
will
not
be
ashamed
of
her
child
ashamed
of
you
i
often
wish
i
could
make
americans
understand
the
feeling
of
england
to
you
the
honest
pride
as
of
a
mother
who
has
brought
into
the
world
the
biggest
baby
that
ever
this
earth
beheld
and
is
rather
proud
of
its
stamping
about
and
beating
her
in
its
pretty
pets
only
the
old
lady
does
get
a
little
cross
when
she
hears
you
talk
of
the
wrongs
which
you
have
endured
from
her
and
teaching
your
children
to
hate
us
as
their
ancient
oppressors
on
the
ground
of
a
foolish
war
of
which
every
englishman
is
utterly
ashamed
and
in
the
result
of
which
he
glories
really
as
much
as
you
do
do
talk
of
claude
you
know
well
what
i
think
on
that
point
never
did
one
nation
make
the
to
another
more
fully
and
nobly
than
you
have
to
us
and
those
who
try
to
keep
up
the
quarrel
are
i
wo
say
what
but
the
truth
is
claude
we
have
had
no
real
sorrows
and
therefore
we
can
afford
to
play
with
imaginary
ones
god
grant
that
we
may
not
have
our
real
ones
that
we
may
not
have
to
drink
of
the
cup
of
which
our
great
mother
drank
two
years
ago
it
was
a
wholesome
bitter
for
us
and
it
may
be
so
for
you
likewise
but
we
will
have
no
sad
forebodings
on
the
eve
of
the
blessed
he
lives
he
loves
he
reigns
and
all
is
well
for
we
are
his
and
he
is
ours
ah
said
stangrave
when
emerson
sneered
at
you
english
for
believing
your
old
testament
he
little
thought
that
that
was
the
lesson
which
it
had
taught
you
and
that
that
same
lesson
was
the
root
of
all
your
greatness
that
that
belief
in
god
being
in
some
mysterious
way
the
living
king
of
england
and
of
christendom
has
been
the
very
idea
which
has
kept
you
in
peace
and
safety
now
for
many
a
hundred
years
moving
slowly
on
from
good
to
better
not
without
many
backslidings
and
many
shortcomings
but
still
finding
out
quickly
enough
when
you
were
on
the
wrong
road
and
not
ashamed
to
retrace
your
steps
and
to
as
brave
strong
men
should
dare
to
do
a
people
who
have
been
for
many
an
age
in
the
vanguard
of
all
the
nations
and
the
champions
of
sure
and
solid
progress
throughout
the
world
because
what
is
new
among
you
is
not
patched
artificially
on
to
the
old
but
grows
organically
out
of
it
with
a
growth
like
that
of
your
own
english
oak
whose
every
is
fed
by
roots
which
burrow
deep
in
many
a
buried
generation
and
the
rich
soil
of
full
a
thousand
years
stay
said
the
little
artist
we
are
quite
conceited
enough
already
without
your
eloquent
adulation
sir
but
there
is
a
truth
in
your
words
there
is
a
better
spirit
roused
among
us
and
that
not
merely
of
two
years
ago
i
knew
this
part
of
the
country
well
in
and
since
then
i
can
bear
witness
a
spirit
of
has
been
awakened
round
here
in
many
a
heart
which
i
thought
once
utterly
frivolous
i
find
in
every
circle
of
every
class
men
and
women
asking
to
be
taught
their
duty
that
they
may
go
and
do
it
i
find
everywhere
schools
libraries
and
mechanics
institutes
springing
up
and
rich
and
poor
meeting
together
more
and
more
in
the
faith
that
god
has
made
them
all
as
for
the
outward
and
material
improvements
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
since
free
trade
and
emigration
the
labourers
confess
themselves
better
off
than
they
have
been
for
fifty
years
and
though
you
will
not
see
in
the
chalk
counties
that
rapid
and
enormous
agricultural
improvement
which
you
will
in
lincolnshire
yorkshire
or
the
lothians
yet
you
shall
see
enough
to
settle
for
you
the
question
whether
we
folk
are
in
a
state
of
decadence
and
decay
and
claude
pointed
to
the
clean
large
fields
with
their
neat
among
which
here
and
there
stood
cottages
more
than
of
them
new
those
fallow
fields
ten
years
ago
were
poor
clay
pastures
fetlock
deep
in
mire
six
months
in
the
year
and
accursed
in
the
eyes
of
my
poor
dear
old
friend
squire
lavington
because
they
were
so
full
of
old
that
they
threw
all
horses
down
i
am
no
farmer
but
they
seem
surely
to
be
somewhat
altered
since
then
as
he
spoke
they
turned
off
the
main
line
of
the
rolling
clays
toward
the
foot
of
the
chalk
hills
and
began
to
brush
through
short
cuttings
of
blue
gault
and
green
sand
so
called
by
geologists
because
its
usual
colours
are
bright
brown
and
crimson
soon
they
get
glimpses
of
broad
silver
whit
as
she
slides
with
divided
streams
through
bright
and
stately
groves
of
poplar
and
abele
and
pine
while
far
aloft
upon
the
left
the
downs
rise
steep
crowned
with
black
fir
spinnies
and
dotted
with
dark
box
and
juniper
soon
they
pass
old
whitford
priory
with
its
numberless
gables
nestling
amid
mighty
elms
and
the
nunpool
flashing
and
roaring
as
of
old
and
the
broad
shallow
below
sparkling
and
laughing
in
the
low
but
bright
december
sun
so
slides
on
the
noble
river
for
ever
changing
and
yet
for
ever
the
same
always
fulfilling
its
errand
which
yet
is
never
fulfilled
said
stangrave
he
was
given
to
utterances
and
hankerings
after
pagan
mythology
learnt
in
the
days
when
he
worshipped
emerson
and
tried
but
unsuccessfully
to
worship
margaret
fuller
ossoli
those
old
greeks
had
a
deep
insight
into
nature
when
they
gave
to
each
river
not
merely
a
name
but
a
personality
a
of
its
own
it
may
be
but
a
collection
of
atoms
of
water
what
is
your
body
but
a
similar
collection
of
atoms
decaying
and
renewing
every
moment
yet
you
are
a
person
and
is
not
the
river
too
a
person
a
live
thing
it
has
an
individual
countenance
which
you
love
which
you
would
recognise
again
meet
it
where
you
will
it
marks
the
whole
landscape
it
determines
probably
the
geography
and
the
society
of
a
whole
district
it
draws
you
too
to
itself
by
an
indefinable
mesmeric
attraction
if
you
stop
in
a
strange
place
the
first
instinct
of
your
idle
is
to
lounge
by
the
river
it
is
a
person
to
you
you
call
it
scotchmen
do
at
least
she
and
not
it
how
do
you
know
that
you
are
not
philosophically
correct
and
that
the
river
has
a
spirit
as
well
as
you
humph
said
claude
who
talks
mysticism
himself
by
the
hour
but
snubs
it
in
every
one
else
it
has
trout
at
least
and
they
stand
i
suppose
for
its
soul
as
the
raisins
did
for
those
of
jean
gingerbread
bride
and
bridegroom
and
peradventure
baby
oh
you
materialist
english
all
of
you
from
the
duke
who
shooteth
stags
to
the
clod
who
poacheth
rabbits
and
who
therefore
can
fight
russians
at
inkermann
duke
and
clod
alike
and
side
by
side
never
better
says
the
chronicler
of
old
than
in
their
first
battle
i
can
neither
fight
nor
fish
and
on
the
whole
agree
with
you
but
i
think
it
proper
to
be
as
english
as
i
can
in
the
presence
of
an
american
a
whistle
a
creak
a
jar
and
they
stop
at
the
little
whitford
station
where
a
cicerone
for
the
vale
far
better
than
claude
was
made
his
appearance
in
the
person
of
mark
armsworth
banker
railway
director
and
king
of
whitbury
town
long
since
elected
by
universal
suffrage
his
own
vote
included
as
permanent
of
her
gracious
majesty
he
hails
claude
cheerfully
from
the
platform
as
he
waddles
about
with
a
face
as
of
the
rising
sun
radiant
with
good
fun
good
humour
good
deeds
good
news
and
good
living
his
coat
was
scarlet
once
but
purple
now
his
leathers
and
boots
were
doubtless
clean
this
morning
but
are
now
afflicted
with
elephantiasis
being
three
inches
deep
in
solid
mud
which
his
old
groom
is
scraping
off
as
fast
as
he
can
his
cap
is
duntled
in
his
back
bears
fresh
stains
of
peat
a
gentle
rain
distils
from
the
few
angles
of
his
person
and
bedews
the
platform
for
mark
armsworth
has
been
in
whit
all
porters
and
guards
touch
their
hats
to
him
the
rushes
up
and
down
frantically
shouting
where
are
those
now
then
look
alive
for
mark
is
chairman
of
the
line
and
everybody
friend
beside
and
as
he
stands
there
being
scraped
he
finds
time
to
inquire
after
every
one
of
the
officials
by
turns
and
after
their
wives
children
and
sweethearts
beside
what
a
fine
specimen
of
your
english
squire
says
stangrave
he
is
no
squire
he
is
the
whitbury
banker
of
whom
i
told
you
armsworth
said
stangrave
looking
at
the
old
man
with
interest
mark
armsworth
himself
he
is
acting
as
squire
though
now
for
he
has
hunted
the
whitford
priors
ever
since
poor
old
lavington
death
now
then
those
very
sorry
sir
i
telegraphed
up
but
we
could
get
but
one
down
put
the
horses
into
that
then
and
there
an
empty
carriage
jack
put
the
hounds
into
it
and
they
shall
all
go
second
class
as
sure
as
i
chairman
the
grinning
porters
hand
the
strange
passengers
in
while
mark
counts
the
couples
with
his
ravager
roysterer
melody
all
right
why
where
that
old
thief
of
a
goodman
went
over
a
gate
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
couples
and
would
come
in
at
any
price
sir
says
the
huntsman
gone
home
by
himself
i
expect
goodman
goodman
boy
and
forthwith
out
of
the
slips
the
noble
old
hound
who
has
hidden
for
purposes
of
his
own
till
he
sees
all
the
rest
safe
locked
in
up
he
goes
to
mark
and
begins
wriggling
against
his
knees
and
looking
up
as
only
dogs
can
oh
want
to
go
with
me
eh
jump
in
then
and
in
jumps
the
hound
and
mark
struggles
after
him
hillo
sir
come
out
here
are
your
betters
here
before
you
as
he
sees
stangrave
and
a
fat
old
lady
in
the
opposite
corner
oh
no
let
the
dog
stay
says
stangrave
i
shall
wet
you
sir
i
afraid
oh
no
and
mark
settles
himself
puffing
with
the
hound
head
on
his
knees
and
begins
talking
fast
and
loud
well
mellot
you
a
stranger
here

seen

goodman
my
boy
i
want

a
friend
of
mine
proud
to
know
any
friend
of
yours
sir
stangrave
armsworth
stangrave
is
an
american
gentleman
who
is
anxious
to
see
whitbury
and
the
neighbourhood
well
i
shall
be
happy
to
show
it
him
then
ca
have
a
better
guide
though
i
say
it
know
everything
by
this
time
and
everybody
man
woman
and
child
as
i
hope
stangrave
find
when
he
gets
to
know
old
mark
you
must
not
speak
of
getting
to
know
you
my
dear
sir
i
know
you
intimately
already
i
assure
you
and
more
am
under
very
deep
obligations
to
you
which
i
regret
to
say
i
can
only
repay
by
thanks
obligation
to
me
my
dear
sir
indeed
i
am
i
will
tell
you
all
when
we
are
alone
and
stangrave
glanced
at
the
fat
old
woman
who
seemed
to
be
listening
intently
oh
never
mind
her
says
armsworth
deaf
as
a
post
very
good
woman
but
so
deaf
ought
to
speak
to
her
though
and
reaching
across
to
the
infinite
amusement
of
his
companions
he
roared
in
the
fat
woman
face
with
a
voice
as
of
a
glad
to
see
you
grove
got
those
dividends
ready
for
you
next
time
you
come
into
town
yah
screamed
the
hapless
woman
who
as
the
rest
saw
heard
perfectly
well
what
do
you
mean
frightening
a
lady
in
that
way
deaf
indeed
why
roared
mark
again
ai
you
grove
of
drytown
dirtywater
no
nor
no
acquaintance
what
business
is
it
of
sir
to
go
hollering
in
ladies
faces
at
your
age
well
but
i
swear
if
you
ai
her
you
somebody
else
i
know
you
as
well
as
the
town
clock
me
if
you
must
know
sir
i
pettigrew
mother
the
linendraper
establishment
sir
down
for
christmas
sir
humph
says
mark
you
see
was
sure
i
knew
her
know
everybody
here
as
i
said
if
she
was
grove
she
was
somebody
else
ever
in
these
parts
before
never
but
i
have
heard
a
good
deal
of
them
and
very
much
charmed
with
them
i
am
i
have
seldom
seen
a
more
distinctive
specimen
of
english
scenery
and
how
you
are
improving
round
here
said
claude
who
knew
weak
points
and
wanted
to
draw
him
out
your
homesteads
seem
all
new
three
fields
have
been
thrown
into
one
i
fancy
over
half
the
farms
mark
broke
out
at
once
on
his
favourite
topic
i
believe
you
making
the
mare
go
here
in
whitford
without
the
money
too
sometimes
i
steward
now
bailiff
ha
ha
these
four
years
past
to
lavington
irish
husband
i
wanted
him
to
have
a
regular
agent
a
canny
scot
or
yorkshireman
faith
the
poor
man
could
afford
it
and
so
fell
back
on
old
mark
paddy
loves
a
job
you
know
so
i
the
votes
and
the
fishing
and
send
him
his
rents
and
manage
all
the
rest
pretty
much
my
own
way
when
the
name
of
lavington
was
mentioned
mark
observed
stangrave
start
and
an
expression
passed
over
his
face
difficult
to
be
defined
it
seemed
to
mark
mingled
pride
and
shame
he
turned
to
claude
and
said
in
a
low
voice
but
loud
enough
for
mark
to
hear
lavington
is
this
their
country
also
as
i
am
going
to
visit
the
graves
of
my
ancestors
i
suppose
i
ought
to
visit
those
of
hers
mark
caught
the
words
which
he
was
not
intended
to
eh
sir
do
you
belong
to
these
parts
my
family
i
believe
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
of
whitbury
at
a
place
called
to
be
sure
old
now
fine
old
oak
carving
in
it
though
fine
old
family
it
must
have
been
church
full
of
their
monuments
hum
ha
well
that
pleasant
now
i
often
heard
there
were
good
old
families
away
there
in
new
england
never
thought
that
there
were
whitbury
people
among
them
hum
well
the
world
not
so
big
as
people
think
after
all
and
you
spoke
of
the
lavingtons
they
are
great
folks
here
or
were
he
was
going
to
rattle
on
but
he
saw
a
pained
expression
on
both
the
travellers
faces
and
stangrave
stopped
him
somewhat
drily
i
know
nothing
of
them
i
assure
you
or
they
of
me
your
country
here
is
certainly
charming
and
shows
little
of
those
signs
of
decay
which
some
people
in
america
impute
to
it
decay
mark
went
off
at
score
decay
be
hanged
there
life
in
the
old
dog
yet
sir
and
dead
pigs
are
looking
up
since
free
trade
and
emigration
cheap
bread
and
high
wages
now
and
instead
of
lands
going
out
of
cultivation
as
they
threatened
bosh
there
a
greater
breadth
down
in
wheat
in
the
vale
now
than
there
ever
was
and
look
at
the
roots
farmers
must
farm
now
or
sink
and
by
george
they
are
farming
like
sensible
fellows
and
a
fig
for
that
old
turnip
ghost
of
protection
there
was
a
fellow
came
down
from
the
carlton
you
know
what
that
is
stangrave
bowed
and
smiled
assent
from
the
carlton
sir
two
years
since
and
tried
it
on
till
he
fell
in
with
old
mark
i
told
him
a
thing
or
two
among
the
rest
told
him
to
his
face
that
he
was
a
liar
for
he
wanted
to
make
farmers
believe
they
were
ruined
when
he
knew
they
were
not
and
that
he
get
back
protection
when
he
knew
that
he
could
and
what
more
he
did
mean
to
so
he
cut
up
rough
and
wanted
to
call
me
out
did
you
go
asked
stangrave
who
was
fast
becoming
amused
with
his
man
i
told
him
that
that
was
my
line
unless
he
try
eley
greens
at
forty
yards
and
then
i
was
his
man
but
if
he
laid
a
finger
on
me
i
give
him
as
sound
a
horsewhipping
old
as
i
am
as
ever
man
had
in
his
life
and
so
i
would
and
mark
looked
complacently
at
his
own
broad
shoulders
and
since
then
my
lord
and
i
have
had
it
all
our
own
way
and
minchampstead
and
is
the
only
firm
in
the
vale
what
become
of
a
lord
vieuxbois
who
used
to
live
somewhere
hereabouts
i
used
to
meet
him
at
rome
rome
said
mark
solemnly
yes
he
was
too
fond
of
rome
awhile
back
ca
see
what
people
want
running
into
foreign
parts
to
look
at
those
poor
idolators
and
their
punch
and
judy
plays
pray
for
and
keep
clear
of
them
is
the
best
rule
but
he
has
married
my
lord
youngest
daughter
and
three
pretty
children
he
has
ducks
of
children
always
comes
to
see
me
in
my
shop
when
he
drives
into
town
oh
he
doing
pretty
one
of
these
new
peelites
they
call
them
hope
they
be
as
good
as
the
name
however
he
a
freetrader
because
he
ca
help
it
so
we
have
his
votes
and
as
to
his
conservatism
let
him
conserve
hips
and
haws
if
he
chooses
like
a
after
all
why
pull
down
anything
before
tumbling
on
your
head
by
the
by
sir
as
you
a
man
of
money
there
that
farm
in
the
market
now
pretty
little
investment
i
see
that
you
got
it
cheap
and
my
lord
would
bid
against
you
of
course
as
you
a
liberal
all
americans
are
i
suppose
and
so
you
oblige
us
as
well
as
yourself
for
it
would
give
us
another
vote
for
the
county
upon
my
word
you
tempt
me
but
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
just
the
moment
for
an
american
to
desert
his
own
country
and
settle
in
england
i
should
not
be
here
now
had
i
not
this
autumn
done
all
i
could
for
america
in
america
and
so
crossed
the
sea
to
serve
her
if
possible
in
england
well
perhaps
not
especially
if
you
a
frémonter
i
am
i
assure
you
thought
as
much
by
your
looks
do
see
what
else
an
honest
man
can
be
just
now
stangrave
laughed
i
hope
every
one
thinks
so
in
england
trust
us
for
that
sir
we
know
a
man
when
we
see
him
here
i
hope
they
do
the
same
across
the
water
there
was
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
mark
began
again
look
there
the
farm
that
my
lord
i
should
like
to
show
you
the
there
sir
all
my
lord
ducie
and
sir
edward
knightley
stock
bought
a
of
him
the
other
day
myself
for
a
cool
hundred
old
fool
that
i
am
never
mind
spreads
the
breed
and
here
are
mills
four
pair
of
new
stones
old
whit
do
know
herself
again
but
i
dare
say
they
look
small
enough
to
you
sir
after
your
american
what
of
that
it
is
just
as
honourable
in
you
to
make
the
most
of
a
small
river
as
in
us
to
make
the
most
of
a
large
one
you
speak
like
a
book
sir
by
the
by
if
you
think
of
taking
home
a
calf
or
two
to
improve
your
new
england
breed
there
are
a
good
many
gone
across
the
sea
in
the
last
few
years
i
think
we
could
find
you
three
or
four
beauties
not
so
very
dear
considering
the
blood
thanks
but
i
really
am
no
farmer
well
no
offence
i
hope
but
i
am
like
your
yankees
in
one
thing
you
see
always
have
an
eye
to
a
bit
of
business
if
i
did
i
should
be
here
now
how
very
tasteful
our
own
american
shrubs
what
a
pity
that
they
are
not
in
flower
what
is
this
asked
stangrave
one
of
your
noblemen
parks
and
they
began
to
run
through
the
cutting
in
minchampstead
park
where
the
owner
has
concealed
the
banks
of
the
rail
for
nearly
half
a
mile
in
a
thicket
of
azaleas
rhododendrons
and
clambering
roses
all
is
it
pretty
his
lordship
let
us
have
the
land
for
a
song
only
bargained
that
we
should
keep
low
not
to
spoil
his
view
and
so
we
did
and
he
planted
our
cutting
for
us
i
call
that
a
present
to
the
county
and
a
very
pretty
one
too
ah
give
me
these
new
brooms
that
sweep
clean
your
old
brooms
like
lord
vieuxbois
were
new
brooms
once
and
swept
well
enough
five
hundred
years
ago
said
stangrave
who
had
that
filial
reverence
for
english
antiquity
which
sits
so
gracefully
upon
many
highly
educated
and
americans
worn
to
the
stumps
now
too
many
of
them
sir
and
want
as
our
would
say
and
i
doubt
whether
most
of
them
are
worth
the
cost
of
a
fresh
bind
not
that
i
can
say
that
of
the
young
lord
he
foremost
in
all
that
good
if
he
had
but
money
and
when
he
has
he
gives
brains
gave
a
lecture
in
our
institute
at
whitford
last
winter
on
the
four
great
poets
shot
over
my
head
a
little
and
other
people
too
but
my
mary
my
daughter
sir
thought
it
beautiful
and
there
nothing
that
she
do
know
it
is
very
hopeful
to
see
your
aristocracy
joining
in
the
general
movement
and
bringing
their
taste
and
knowledge
to
bear
on
the
lower
classes
yes
sir
we
going
all
right
now
in
the
old
country
only
have
to
steer
straight
and
not
put
on
too
much
steam
but
give
me
the
after
all
they
may
be
close
men
of
business
how
else
could
one
live
but
when
it
comes
to
giving
i
back
them
against
the
old
ones
for
generosity
or
taste
either
they
their
proper
pride
when
they
get
hold
of
the
land
and
they
like
to
show
it
and
quite
right
they
you
must
see
my
little
place
too
it
not
in
such
bad
order
though
i
say
it
and
am
but
a
country
banker
but
i
back
my
flowers
against
half
the
squires
round
my
mary
that
is
and
my
fruit
see
there
there
my
lord
new
schools
and
his
model
cottages
with
more
comforts
in
them
saving
the
size
than
my
father
house
had
and
there
his
barrack
as
he
calls
it
for
the
unmarried
men
and
in
common
and
a
library
of
books
and
a
for
each
it
seems
strange
to
complain
of
prosperity
said
stangrave
but
i
sometimes
regret
that
in
america
there
is
so
little
room
for
the
very
highest
virtues
all
are
so
well
off
that
one
never
needs
to
give
and
what
a
man
does
here
for
others
they
do
for
themselves
so
much
the
better
for
them
there
are
other
ways
of
being
generous
besides
putting
your
hand
in
your
pocket
sir
by
jove
there
be
room
enough
if
you
excuse
me
for
an
american
to
do
fine
things
as
long
as
those
poor
negro
slaves
i
know
it
i
know
it
said
stangrave
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
had
already
made
up
his
mind
on
a
painful
subject
and
wished
to
hear
no
more
of
it
you
will
excuse
me
but
i
am
come
here
to
learn
what
i
can
of
england
of
my
own
country
i
know
enough
i
trust
to
do
my
duty
in
it
when
i
return
mark
was
silent
seeing
that
he
had
touched
a
tender
place
and
pointed
out
one
object
of
interest
after
another
as
they
ran
through
the
flat
park
past
the
great
house
with
its
doric
façade
which
the
eighteenth
century
had
raised
above
the
quiet
cell
of
the
minchampstead
recluses
it
is
very
ugly
said
stangrave
and
truly
comfortable
enough
though
and
as
somebody
said
people
live
inside
their
houses
and
not
outside
you
should
see
the
pictures
there
though
while
you
in
the
country
i
can
show
you
one
or
two
too
i
hope
never
grudge
money
for
good
pictures
the
pleasantest
furniture
in
the
world
as
long
as
you
keep
them
and
if
you
tired
of
them
always
fetch
double
their
price
after
minchampstead
the
rail
leaves
the
sands
and
clays
and
turns
up
between
the
chalk
hills
along
the
barge
river
which
it
has
rendered
useless
save
as
a
supernumerary
and
then
along
whit
now
flowing
clearer
and
clearer
as
we
approach
its

amid
the
lofty

through

of

willow
and

with
tall
golden
reeds
and
still
dykes
each
in

a

while
stangrave
looks
out
of
the
window
his
face
lighting
up
with
curiosity
how
perfectly
english
at
least
how
perfectly
it
is
just
tennyson
beautiful

either
side

lie
long
fields
of
barley

the

the

herself
instead
of

is
reading

and
becoming
all
the

thereby
and
teaching
poor
children
in
hemmelford
national
school
and
where
is

knight
asked
stangrave

one
half
hopes
to

riding
down
from

grand
old

which
sulks

at

instead
of
the
fairy
knight
toiling
along
in
the
blazing
summer
weather
sweating
in
burning
metal
like
poor
perillus
in
his
own

then
the
fairy
knight
is
extinct
in

asked
stangrave
smiling
no
man
less
only
he
not
vieuxbois
but
his
younger
brother
has
found
a
cooler
than
an
iron
kettle
and
travels
by
rail
when
he
is
at
home
and
when
he
was
in
the
crimea
rode
a
shaggy
pony
and
smoked
cavendish
all
through
the
battle
of
inkermann
he
showed
himself
the
old
sir
lancelot
there
said
stangrave
he
did
wherefore
the
lady
married
him
when
the
guards
came
home
and
he
will
breed
prize
pigs
and
sit
at
the
board
of
guardians
and
take

the
times
clothed
and
in
his
right
mind
for
the
old
berserk
spirit
is
gone
out
of
him
and
he
is
become
respectable
in
a
respectable
age
and
is
nevertheless
just
as
brave
a
fellow
as
ever
and
so
all
things
are
changed
except
the
river
where
still
whiten
aspens
quiver
little
breezes
dash
and
shiver
on
the
stream
that
runneth
ever

said
claude
smiling
the

of

snap
at
the
descendants
of
mediaeval
flies
spinning
about
upon
just
the
same
sized
and
coloured
wings
on
which
their
forefathers
spun
a
thousand
years
ago
having
become
in
all
that
while
neither
bigger
nor
wiser
but
is
it
not
a
grand
thought
asked
stangrave
the
silence
and
permanence
of
nature
amid
the
perpetual
flux
and
noise
of
human
life
a
grand
thought
that
one
generation
goeth
and
another
cometh
and
the
earth
abideth
for
ever
at
least
it
is
so
much
the
worse
for
the
poor
old
earth
if
her
doom
is
to
stand
still
while
man
improves
and
progresses
from
age
to
age
may
i
ask
one
question
sir
said
stangrave
who
saw
that
their
conversation
was
puzzling
their
jolly
companion
have
you
heard
any
news
yet
of
mr
thurnall
mark
looked
him
full
in
the
face
do
you
know
him
i
did
in
past
years
most
intimately
then
you
knew
the
finest
fellow
sir
that
ever
walked
mortal
earth
i
have
discovered
that
sir
as
well
as
you
i
am
under
obligations
to
that
man
which
my
heart
blood
will
not
repay
i
shall
make
no
secret
of
telling
you
what
they
are
at
a
fit
time
mark
held
out
his
broad
red
hand
and
grasped
stangrave
till
the
joints
cracked
his
face
grew
as
red
as
a
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
his
father
must
hear
that
hang
it
his
father
must
hear
that
and
grace
too
grace
said
claude
and
is
she
with
you
with
the
old
man
the
angel
tending
him
night
and
day
and
as
beautiful
as
ever
sir
said
mark
solemnly
when
any
one
soul
is
as
beautiful
as
hers
is
one
never
thinks
about
her
face
who
is
grace
asked
stangrave
a
saint
and
a
heroine
said
claude
you
shall
know
all
for
you
ought
to
know
but
you
have
no
news
of
tom
and
i
have
none
either
i
am
losing
all
hope
now
i
not
sir
said
mark
fiercely
sir
that
boy
not
dead
he
ca
be
he
has
more
lives
than
a
cat
and
if
you
know
anything
of
him
you
ought
to
know
that
i
have
good
reason
to
know
it
none
more
but
but
sir
but
what
harm
come
to
him
sir
the
lord
would
harm
him
for
his
father
sake
and
as
for
the
devil
i
tell
you
sir
if
he
tried
to
fly
away
with
him
he
have
to
drop
him
before
he
gone
a
mile
and
mark
began
blowing
his
nose
violently
and
getting
so
red
that
he
seemed
on
the
point
of
going
into
a
fit
tell
you
what
it
is
gentlemen
said
he
at
last
you
come
and
stay
with
me
and
see
his
father
it
will
comfort
the
old
man
and
and
comfort
me
too
for
i
get
about
him
at
times
strange
attraction
there
was
about
that
man
says
stangrave
to
claude
he
was
like
a
son
to
him
now
gentlemen
mellot
you
do
hunt
no
thank
you
said
claude
stangrave
does
i
warrant
i
have
at
various
times
both
in
england
and
in
virginia
ah
do
they
keep
up
the
real
sport
there
eh
well
that
the
best
thing
i
heard
of
them
sir
my
horses

yours
a
friend

that
boy

days

week

eight
dinner
at
none
of
your
late
london
hours
for
me
sir
and
after
it
the
best
bottle
of
port
though
i
say
it
short
of
my
friend
s
at
reading
you
must
accept
whispered
claude
or
he
will
be
angry
so
stangrave
accepted
and
all
the
more
readily
because
he
wanted
to
hear
from
the
good
banker
many
things
about
the
lost
tom
thurnall
here
we
are
cries
mark
now
you
must
excuse
me
see
to
yourselves
i
see
to
the
puppies
dinner
at
mind
come
along
goodman
boy
is
this
whitbury
asks
stangrave
it
was
whitbury
indeed
pleasant
old
town
which
slopes
down
the
to
the
old
church
just
restored
though
by
lords
minchampstead
and
vieuxbois
not
without
mark
armsworth
help
to
its
ancient
beauty
of
grey
flint
and
white
clunch
and
quaint
wooden
spire
pleasant
churchyard
round
it
where
the
dead
lie
looking
up
to
the
bright
southern
sun
among
huge
black
yews
upon
their
knoll
of
white
chalk
above
the
ancient
stream
pleasant
white
wooden
bridge
with
its
row
of
urchins
dropping
flints
upon
the
noses
of
elephantine
trout
or
fishing
over
the
rail
with
crooked
pins
while
hapless
gudgeon
come
dangling
upward
between
stream
and
sky
with
a
look
of
sheepish
surprise
and
shame
as
of
a
caught
stealing
apples
in
their
foolish
visages
pleasant
new
national
schools
at
the
bridge
end
whither
the
urchins
scamper
at
the
sound
of
the
two
bell
though
it
be
an
ugly
pile
enough
of
bright
red
brick
it
is
doing
its
work
as
whitbury
folk
know
well
by
now
pleasant
too
though
still
more
ugly
those
long
red
arms
of
new
houses
which
whitbury
is
stretching
out
along
its
fine
turnpikes
especially
up
to
the
railway
station
beyond
the
bridge
and
to
the
smart
new
hotel
which
hopes
but
hopes
in
vain
to
outrival
the
ancient
rest
away
thither
and
not
to
the
railway
hotel
they
trundle
in
a
fly
leaving
mark
armsworth
all
but
angry
because
they
will
not
sleep
as
well
as
breakfast
lunch
and
dine
with
him
daily
and
settle
in
the
good
old
inn
with
its
three
white
gables
overhanging
the
pavement
and
its
long
lattice
window
buried
deep
beneath
them
like
so
stangrave
says
to
a
shrewd
kindly
eye
under
a
bland
white
forehead
no
good
old
inn
not
such
shall
be
thy
fate
as
long
as
trout
are
trout
and
men
have
wit
to
catch
them
for
art
thou
not
a
sacred
house
art
thou
not
consecrate
to
the
whitbury
brotherhood
of
anglers
is
not
the
wainscot
of
that
long
low
parlour
inscribed
with
many
a
famous
name
are
not
its
walls
hung
with
many
a
famous
countenance
has
not
its
ceiling
rung
for
now
a
hundred
years
to
the
laughter
of
painters
sculptors
grave
divines
unbending
at
least
there
great
lawyers
statesmen
wits
even
of
foote
and
quin
themselves
while
the
sleek
landlord
wiped
the
cobwebs
off
another
magnum
of
that
grand
old
port
and
took
in
all
the
wisdom
with
a
quiet
twinkle
of
his
sleepy
eye
he
rests
now
good
old
man
among
the
yews
beside
his
forefathers
and
on
his
tomb
his
lengthy
epitaph
writ
by
himself
for
barker
was
a
poet
in
his
way
some
people
hold
the
same
epitaph
to
be
irreverent
because
in
a
list
of
barker
many
blessings
occurs
the
profane
word
trout
but
those
trout
and
the
custom
which
they
brought
him
had
made
the
old
life
comfortable
and
enabled
him
to
leave
a
competence
for
his
children
and
why
should
not
a
man
honestly
thank
heaven
for
that
which
he
knows
has
done
him
good
even
though
it
be
but
fish
he
is
gone
but
the
whit
is
not
nor
the
whitbury
club
nor
will
while
old
mark
armsworth
is
king
in
whitbury
and
sits
every
evening
in
the
mayfly
season
at
the
table
head
retailing
good
stones
of
the
great
anglers
of
his
youth
names
which
you
reader
have
heard
many
a
time
and
who
could
do
many
things
besides
handling
a
but
though
the
club
is
not
what
it
was
fifty
years
ago
before
norway
and
scotland
became
easy
of
access
yet
it
is
still
an
important
institution
of
the
town
to
the
members
whereof
all
good
subjects
touch
their
hats
for
does
not
the
club
bring
into
the
town
good
money
and
take
out
again
only
fish
which
cost
nothing
in
the
breeding
did
not
the
club
present
the
with
a
portrait
of
the
renowned
fishing
sculptor
and
did
it
not
only
stipulating
that
the
school
should
be
built
beyond
the
bridge
to
avoid
noise
give
fifty
pounds
to
the
said
school
but
five
years
ago
in
addition
to
mark
own
hundred
but
enough
of
this
only
may
the
whitbury
club
in
recompense
for
my
thus
handing
them
down
to
immortality
give
me
another
day
next
year
as
they
gave
me
this
and
may
the
mayfly
be
strong
on
and
a
gale
blowing
in
the
course
of
the
next
week
in
many
a
conversation
the
three
men
compared
notes
as
to
the
events
of
two
years
ago
and
each
supplied
the
other
with
new
facts
which
shall
be
duly
set
forth
in
this
tale
saving
and
excepting
of
course
the
real
reason
why
everybody
did
everything
for
as
everybody
knows
who
has
watched
life
the
true
springs
of
all
human
action
are
generally
those
which
fools
will
not
see
which
wise
men
will
not
mention
so
that
in
order
to
present
a
readable
tragedy
of
hamlet
you
must
always
omit
the
part
of
hamlet
and
probably
the
ghost
and
the
queen
into

bargain
chapter
poetry
and
prose
now
to
tell
my
story
if
not
as
it
ought
to
be
told
at
least
as
i
can
tell
it
i
must
go
back
sixteen
years
to
the
days
when
whitbury
boasted
of
forty
coaches
per
diem
instead
of
one
railway
and
set
forth
how
in
its
southern
suburb
there
stood
two
pleasant
houses
side
by
side
with
their
gardens
sloping
down
to
the
whit
and
parted
from
each
other
only
by
the
high
brick
through
which
there
used
to
be
a
door
of
communication
for
the
two
occupiers
were
fast
friends
in
one
of
these
two
houses
sixteen
years
ago
lived
our
friend
mark
armsworth
banker
solicitor
churchwarden
guardian
of
the
poor
justice
of
the
peace
in
a
word
viceroy
of
whitbury
town
and
far
more
potent
therein
than
her
gracious
majesty
queen
victoria
in
the
other
lived
edward
thurnall
esquire
doctor
of
medicine
and
consulting
physician
of
all
the
country
round
these
two
men
were
as
brothers
and
had
been
as
brothers
for
now
twenty
years
though
no
two
men
could
be
more
different
save
in
the
two
common
virtues
which
bound
them
to
each
other
and
that
was
that
they
both
were
honest
and
men
what
mark
character
was
and
is
i
have
already
shown
and
enough
of
it
i
hope
to
make
my
readers
like
the
good
old
banker
as
for
doctor
thurnall
a
purer
or
gentler
soul
never
entered
a
with
patient
wisdom
in
his
brain
and
patient
tenderness
in
his
heart
beloved
and
trusted
by
rich
and
poor
he
had
made
to
himself
a
practice
large
enough
to
enable
him
to
settle
two
sons
well
in
his
own
profession
the
third
and
youngest
was
still
in
whitbury
he
was
something
of
a
geologist
too
and
a
botanist
and
an
antiquarian
and
mark
armsworth
who
knew
and
knows
still
nothing
of
science
looked
up
to
the
doctor
as
an
inspired
sage
quoted
him
defended
his
opinion
right
or
wrong
and
thrust
him
forward
at
public
meetings
and
in
all
places
and
seasons
much
to
the
modest
discomfiture
the
good
doctor
was
sitting
in
his
study
on
the
morning
on
which
my
tale
begins
having
just
finished
his
breakfast
and
settled
to
his
microscope
in
the
opening
on
the
lawn
a
beautiful
october
morning
it
was
one
of
those
in
which
dame
nature
healthily
tired
with
the
revelry
of
summer
is
composing
herself
with
a
quiet
satisfied
smile
for
her
winter
sleep
sheets
of
dappled
cloud
were
sliding
slowly
from
the
west
long
bars
of
hazy
blue
hung
over
the
southern
chalk
downs
which
gleamed
pearly
grey
beneath
the
low
sun
in
the
vale
below
soft
white
flakes
of
mist
still
hung
over
the
water
meadows
and
barred
the
dark
trunks
of
the
huge
elms
and
poplars
whose
leaves
came
showering
down
at
the
very
rustle
of
the
western
breeze
spotting
the
grass
below
the
river
swirled
along
glassy
no
more
but
dingy
grey
with
autumn
rains
and
rotten
leaves
all
beyond
the
garden
told
of
autumn
bright
and
peaceful
even
in
decay
but
up
the
sunny
slope
of
the
garden
itself
and
to
the
very
window
sill
summer
still
lingered
the
beds
of
red
verbena
and
geranium
were
still
brilliant
though
choked
with
fallen
leaves
of
acacia
and
plane
the
canary
plant
still
untouched
by
frost
twined
its
delicate
green
leaves
and
more
delicate
yellow
blossoms
through
the
crimson
lacework
of
the
and
the
great
yellow
noisette
swung
its
long
canes
across
the
window
filling
all
the
air
with
fruity
fragrance
and
the
good
doctor
lifting
his
eyes
from
his
microscope
looked
out
upon
it
all
with
a
quiet
satisfaction
and
though
his
lips
did
not
move
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
thanking
god
for
it
all
and
thanking
him
too
perhaps
that
he
was
still
permitted
to
gaze
upon
that
fair
world
outside
for
as
he
gazed
he
started
as
if
with
sudden
pain
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
with
something
like
a
sigh
and
then
looked
at
the
microscope
no
more
but
sat
seemingly
absorbed
in
thought
while
upon
his
delicate
features
and
high
bland
unwrinkled
forehead
and
the
few
soft
grey
locks
which
not
time
for
he
was
scarcely
but
long
labour
of
brain
had
spared
to
him
there
lay
a
hopeful
calm
as
of
a
man
who
had
nigh
done
his
work
and
felt
that
he
had
not
altogether
done
it
ill
an
autumnal
calm
resigned
yet
full
of
cheerfulness
which
harmonised
fitly
with
the
quiet
beauty
of
the
decaying
landscape
before
him
i
say
daddy
you
must
drop
that
microscope
and
put
on
your
shade
you
are
ruining
those
dear
old
eyes
of
yours
again
in
spite
of
what
alexander
told
you
the
doctor
took
up
the
green
shade
which
lay
beside
him
and
replaced
it
with
a
sigh
and
a
smile
i
must
use
the
old
things
now
and
then
till
you
can
take
my
place
at
the
microscope
tom
or
till
we
have
as
we
ought
to
have
a
analytical
chemist
settled
in
every
and
paid
in
part
at
least
out
of
the
county
rates
the
tom
who
had
spoken
was
one
of
two
youths
of
eighteen
who
stood
in
opposite
corners
of
the
gazing
out
upon
the
landscape
but
evidently
with
thoughts
as
different
as
were
their
complexions
tom
was
of
that
type
so
common
in
england
sturdy
and
yet
not
coarse
with
small
hands
and
feet
large
jaw
bright
grey
eyes
crisp
brown
hair
a
heavy
projecting
brow
his
face
full
of
shrewdness
and
and
of
humour
withal
which
might
be
at
whiles
a
little
saucy
and
sarcastic
to
judge
from
the
glances
which
he
sent
forth
from
the
corners
of
his
wicked
eyes
at
his
companion
on
the
other
side
of
the
window
he
was
evidently
prepared
for
a
day
shooting
in
velveteen
jacket
and
leather
gaiters
and
stood
feeling
about
in
his
pockets
to
see
whether
he
had
forgotten
any
of
his
tackle
and
muttering
to
himself
amid
his
whistling
capital
day
how
the
birds
will
lie
where
on
earth
is
old
mark
why
must
he
wait
to
smoke
his
cigar
after
breakfast
could
he
have
had
it
in
the
trap
the
blessed
old
chimney
that
he
is
the
other
lad
was
somewhat
taller
than
tom
awkwardly
and
plainly
dressed
but
with
a
byronic
collar
and
long
black
curling
locks
he
was
certainly
handsome
as
far
as
the
form
of
his
features
and
brow
and
would
have
been
very
handsome
but
for
the
bad
complexion
which
at
his
age
so
often
accompanies
a
sedentary
life
and
a
melancholic
temper
one
glance
at
his
face
was
sufficient
to
tell
that
he
was
moody
shy
restless
perhaps
discontented
perhaps
ambitious
and
vain
he
held
in
his
hand
a
volume
of
percy
reliques
which
he
had
just
taken
down
from
shelves
yet
he
was
looking
not
at
it
but
at
the
landscape
nevertheless
as
he
looked
one
might
have
seen
that
he
was
thinking
not
so
much
of
it
as
of
his
own
thoughts
about
it
his
eye
which
was
very
large
dark
and
beautiful
with
heavy
lids
and
long
lashes
had
that
dreamy
look
so
common
among
men
of
the
poetic
temperament
conscious
of
thought
if
not
conscious
of
self
and
as
his
face
kindled
and
his
lips
moved
more
and
more
earnestly
he
began
muttering
to
himself
till
tom
thurnall
burst
into
an
open
laugh
there
jack
at
it
again
making
poetry
i
bet
my
head
to
a
china
orange
and
why
not
said
his
father
looking
up
quietly
but
reprovingly
as
jack
winced
and
blushed
and
a
dark
shade
of
impatience
passed
across
his
face
oh
it
no
concern
of
mine
let
everybody
please
themselves
the
country
looks
very
pretty
no
doubt
i
can
tell
that
only
my
notion
is
that
a
wise
man
ought
to
go
out
and
enjoy
it
as
i
am
going
to
do
with
a
gun
on
his
shoulder
instead
of
poking
at
home
like
a
and
behowling
oneself
in
and
tom
lifted
up
his
voice
into
a
doleful
mastiff
howl
then
be
as
good
as
your
word
tom
and
let
every
one
please
themselves
said
the
doctor
but
the
dark
youth
broke
out
in
sudden
passion
thomas
thurnall
i
will
not
endure
this
why
are
you
always
making
me
your
butt
insulting
me
sir
even
in
your
father
house
you
do
not
understand
me
and
i
do
not
care
to
understand
you
if
my
presence
is
disagreeable
to
you
i
can
easily
relieve
you
of
it
and
the
dark
youth
turned
to
go
away
like
naaman
in
a
rage
stop
john
said
the
doctor
i
think
it
would
be
the
more
courteous
plan
for
tom
to
relieve
you
of
his
presence
go
and
find
mark
tom
and
please
to
remember
that
john
briggs
is
my
guest
and
that
i
will
not
allow
any
rudeness
to
him
in
my
house
i
go
daddy
to
the
world
end
if
you
like
provided
you
ask
me
to
write
poetry
but
jack
takes
offence
so
soon
give
us
your
hand
old
i
meant
no
harm
and
you
know
it
john
briggs
took
the
proffered
hand
sulkily
enough
and
tom
went
out
of
the
glass
door
whistling
as
merry
as
a
cricket
my
dear
boy
said
the
doctor
when
they
were
alone
you
must
try
to
curb
this
temper
of
yours
do
be
angry
with
me
but
i
should
be
an
ungrateful
brute
if
i
was
sir
i
can
bear
anything
from
you
i
ought
to
for
i
owe
everything
to
you
but
but
my
dear
boy
is
he
that
ruleth
his
spirit
than
he
that
taketh
a
city
john
briggs
tapped
his
foot
on
the
ground
impatiently
i
can
not
help
it
sir
it
will
drive
me
mad
i
think
at
times
this
contrast
between
what
i
might
be
and
what
i
am
i
can
bear
it
no
longer
mixing
medicines
here
when
i
might
be
educating
myself
distinguishing
myself
for
i
can
do
it
have
you
not
said
as
much
yourself
to
me
again
and
again
i
have
of
course
but
but
sir
only
hear
me
it
is
in
vain
to
ask
me
to
command
my
temper
while
i
stay
here
i
am
not
fit
for
this
work
not
fit
for
the
dull
country
i
am
not
appreciated
not
understood
and
i
shall
never
be
till
i
can
get
to
london
till
i
can
find
congenial
spirits
and
take
my
rightful
place
in
the
great
parliament
of
mind
i
am
pegasus
in
harness
here
cried
the
vain
discontented
youth
let
me
but
once
get
there
amid
art
civilisation
intellect
and
the
company
of
men
like
that
old
mermaid
club
to
hear
and
to
answer
so
nimble
and
so
full
of
subtle
flame
as
one
had
put
his
whole
soul
in
a
jest
and
then
you
shall
see
whether
pegasus
has
not
wings
and
can
use
them
too
and
he
stopped
suddenly
choking
with
emotion
his
nostril
and
chest
dilating
his
foot
stamping
impatiently
on
the
ground
the
doctor
watched
him
with
a
sad
smile
do
you
remember
the
devil
temptation
of
our
lord
thyself
down
from
hence
for
it
is
written
he
shall
give
his
angels
charge
over
thee
i
do
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
me
throw
away
the
safe
station
in
which
god
has
certainly
put
you
to
seek
by
some
desperate
venture
a
new
and
as
you
fancy
a
grander
one
for
yourself
look
out
of
that
window
lad
is
there
not
poetry
enough
beauty
and
glory
enough
in
that
sky
those
fields
ay
in
every
fallen
leaf
to
employ
all
your
powers
considerable
as
i
believe
them
to
be
why
spurn
the
pure
quiet
country
life
in
which
such
men
as
wordsworth
have
been
content
to
live
and
grow
old
the
boy
shook
his
head
like
an
impatient
horse
too
slow
too
slow
for
me
to
wait
and
wait
as
wordsworth
did
through
long
years
of
obscurity
misconception
ridicule
no
what
i
have
i
must
have
at
once
and
if
it
must
be
die
like
chatterton
if
only
like
chatterton
i
can
have
my
little
day
of
success
and
make
the
world
confess
that
another
priest
of
the
beautiful
has
arisen
among
men
now
it
can
scarcely
be
denied
that
the
good
doctor
was
guilty
of
a
certain
amount
of
weakness
in
listening
patiently
to
all
this
rant
not
that
the
rant
was
very
blamable
in
a
lad
of
eighteen
for
have
we
not
all
while
we
are
going
through
our
course
of
shelley
talked
very
much
the
same
abominable
stuff
and
thought
ourselves
the
grandest
fellows
upon
earth
on
account
of
that
very
length
of
ear
which
was
patent
to
all
the
world
save
our
precious
selves
blinded
by
our
and
wondering
in
wrath
why
everybody
was
laughing
at
us
but
the
truth
is
the
doctor
was
easy
and
indulgent
to
a
fault
and
dreaded
nothing
so
much
save
telling
a
lie
as
hurting
feelings
besides
as
the
acknowledged
wise
man
of
whitbury
he
was
a
little
proud
of
playing
the
maecenas
and
he
had
and
not
unjustly
a
high
opinion
of
john
briggs
powers
so
he
had
lent
him
books
corrected
his
taste
in
many
matters
and
by
dint
of
petting
and
humouring
had
kept
the
wayward
youth
times
from
running
away
from
his
father
who
was
an
apothecary
in
the
town
and
from
the
general
practitioner
bolus
under
whom
john
briggs
fulfilled
the
office
of
with
tom
thurnall
plenty
of
trouble
had
both
the
lads
given
the
doctor
in
the
last
five
years
but
of
very
different
kinds
tom
though
he
was
in
everlasting
hot
water
as
the
most
incorrigible
scapegrace
for
ten
miles
round
contrived
to
confine
his
naughtiness
strictly
to
while
he
learnt
everything
which
was
to
be
learnt
with
marvellous
quickness
and
so
utterly
fulfilled
the
ideal
of
a
for
of
him
too
as
of
all
things
i
presume
an
ideal
exists
eternally
in
the
platonic
universe
that
bolus
told
his
father
in
hours
sir
he
takes
care
of
my
business
as
well
as
i
could
myself
but
out
of
hours
sir
i
believe
he
is
possessed
by
seven
devils
john
briggs
on
the
other
hand
sinned
in
the
very
opposite
direction
too
proud
to
learn
his
business
and
too
proud
also
to
play
the
scapegrace
as
tom
did
he
neglected
alike
work
and
amusement
for
lazy
mooning
over
books
and
the
dreams
which
books
called
up
he
made
perpetual
mistakes
in
the
shop
and
then
considered
himself
insulted
by
an
inferior
spirit
if
poor
bolus
called
him
to
account
for
it
indeed
had
it
not
been
for
many
applications
of
that
precious
oil
of
unity
with
which
the
good
doctor
daily
anointed
the
creaking
wheels
of
whitbury
society
john
briggs
and
his
master
would
have
long
ago
broken
out
of
gear
and
parted
company
in
mutual
wrath
and
fury
and
now
indeed
the
critical
moment
seemed
come
at
last
for
the
lad
began
afresh
to
declare
his
deliberate
intention
of
going
to
london
to
seek
his
fortune
in
spite
of
parents
and
all
the
world
to
live
on
here
and
never
to
rise
perhaps
above
the
post
of
correspondent
to
a
country
newspaper
to
publish
a
volume
of
poems
by
subscription
and
have
to
go
round
hat
in
hand
begging
five
shillings
worth
of
patronage
from
every
stupid
country
squire
intolerable
i
must
go
shakespeare
was
never
shakespeare
till
he
fled
from
miserable
stratford
to
become
at
once
the
friend
of
sidney
and
southampton
but
john
briggs
will
be
john
briggs
still
if
he
went
to
the
moon
shouted
tom
thurnall
who
had
just
come
up
to
the
window
i
advise
you
to
change
that
name
of
yours
jack
to
sidney
or
percy
or
walker
if
you
like
anything
but
the
illustrious
surname
of
briggs
the
poisoner
what
do
you
mean
sir
thundered
john
while
the
doctor
himself
jumped
up
for
tom
was
red
with
rage
what
is
this
tom
what
that
screamed
tom
bursting
in
spite
of
his
passion
into
roars
of
laughter
what
that
and
he
held
out
a
phial
smell
it
taste
it
oh
if
i
had
but
a
gallon
of
it
to
pour
down
your
throat
that
what
you
brought
mark
armsworth
last
night
instead
of
his
cough
mixture
while
your
brains
were
after
poetry
what
is
it
gasped
john
briggs
miss
twiddle
black
dose
strong
enough
to
rive
the
gizard
out
of
an
old
cock
it
not
it
is
roared
mark
armsworth
from
behind
as
he
rushed
in
in
and
gaiters
his
red
face
redder
with
fury
his
red
whiskers
standing
on
end
with
wrath
like
a
tiger
his
left
hand
upon
his
hapless
hypogastric
region
his
right
brandishing
an
empty
glass
which
smelt
strongly
of
brandy
and
water
it
is
and
you
given
me
the
cholera
and
spoilt
my
day
shooting
and
if
i
do
serve
you
out
for
it
there
no
law
in
england
and
spoilt
my
day
shooting
too
the
last
i
shall
get
before
off
to
paris
to
have
a
day
in
lord
minchampstead
preserves
and
to
be
baulked
of
it
in
this
way
john
briggs
stood
as
one
astonied
if
i
do
serve
you
out
for
this
shouted
mark
if
i
do
serve
you
out
for
it
you
shall
never
hear
the
last
of
it
shouted
tom
i
take
to
writing
after
all
i
put
it
in
the
papers
i
make
the
name
of
briggs
the
poisoner
an
abomination
in
the
land
john
briggs
turned
and
fled
well
said
mark
i
must
spend
my
morning
at
home
i
suppose
so
i
shall
just
sit
and
chat
with
you
doctor
and
i
shall
go
and
play
with
molly
said
tom
and
walked
off
to
armsworth
garden
i
do
care
for
myself
so
much
said
mark
but
i
sorry
the
lost
his
last
day
shooting
oh
you
will
be
well
enough
by
noon
and
can
go
then
and
as
for
the
boy
it
is
just
as
well
for
him
not
to
grow
too
fond
of
sports
in
which
he
can
never
indulge
never
indulge
why
not
he
vows
he
go
to
the
rocky
mountains
and
shoot
a
grizzly
bear
and
he
do
it
he
has
a
great
deal
to
do
before
that
poor
fellow
and
a
great
deal
to
learn
and
he
learn
it
you
always
about
the
boy
doctor
i
ca
help
feeling
the
parting
with
him
and
for
paris
too
such
a
seat
of
temptation
but
it
is
his
own
choice
and
after
all
he
must
see
temptation
wherever
he
goes
bless
the
man
if
a
boy
means
to
go
to
the
bad
he
go
just
as
easily
in
whitbury
as
in
paris
give
the
lad
his
head
and
never
fear
he
fall
on
his
legs
like
a
cat
i
warrant
him
whatever
happens
he
as
steady
as
old
time
i
tell
you
there
a
grey
head
on
green
shoulders
there
steady
said
the
doctor
with
a
smile
and
a
shrug
steady
i
tell
you
at
heart
as
prudent
as
you
or
i
and
never
lost
you
a
farthing
that
you
know
hang
good
boys
give
me
one
who
knows
how
to
be
naughty
in
the
right
place
i
would
give
sixpence
for
a
good
boy
i
never
was
one
myself
and
have
no
faith
in
them
give
me
the
lad
who
has
more
steam
up
than
he
knows
what
to
do
with
and
must
needs
blow
off
a
little
in
larks
when
once
he
settles
down
on
the
rail
it
send
him
along
as
steady
as
a
luggage
train
did
you
never
hear
a
locomotive
puffing
and
roaring
before
it
gets
under
way
well
that
what
your
boy
is
doing
look
at
him
now
with
my
poor
little
molly
tom
was
cantering
about
the
garden
with
a
little
weakly
child
of
eight
in
his
arms
the
little
thing
was
looking
up
in
his
face
with
delight
screaming
at
his
jokes
you
are
right
mark
the
boy
heart
can
not
be
in
the
wrong
place
while
he
is
so
fond
of
little
children
poor
molly
how
she
miss
him
do
you
think
she
ever
walk
doctor
i
do
indeed
hum
ah
well
if
she
grows
up
doctor
and
do
go
to
join
her
poor
dear
mother
up
there
i
do
know
that
i
wish
her
a
better
husband
than
your
boy
it
would
be
a
poor
enough
match
for
her
tut
she
have
the
money
and
he
the
brains
mark
my
words
doctor
that
boy
be
a
credit
to
you
he
make
a
noise
in
the
world
or
i
know
nothing
and
if
his
fancy
holds
seven
years
hence
and
he
wants
still
to
turn
traveller
let
him
if
he
minded
to
go
round
the
world
i
back
him
to
go
somehow
or
other
or
i
eat
my
head
ned
thurnall
the
doctor
acquiesced
in
this
hopeful
theory
partly
to
save
an
argument
for
mark
reverence
for
his
opinion
was
confined
to
scientific
matters
and
he
made
up
to
his
own
by
patronising
the
doctor
and
indeed
taking
him
sometimes
pretty
sharply
to
task
on
practical
matters
best
fellow
alive
is
thurnall
but
not
a
man
of
business
poor
fellow
none
of
your
geniuses
are
do
know
what
he
do
without
me
so
tom
carried
mary
about
all
the
morning
and
went
to
minchampstead
in
the
afternoon
and
got
three
hours
good
shooting
but
in
the
evening
he
vanished
and
his
father
went
into
armsworth
to
look
for
him
why
do
you
want
to
know
where
he
is
replied
mark
looking
sly
however
as
you
ca
stop
him
now
i
tell
you
he
is
just
about
this
time
sewing
up
briggs
putting
copperas
into
his
water
jug
and
powdered
galls
on
his
towel
and
making
various
other
little
returns
for
this
morning
favour
i
dislike
practical
jokes
so
do
i
especially
when
they
come
in
the
form
of
a
black
dose
sit
down
old
boy
and
we
have
a
game
at
cribbage
in
a
few
minutes
tom
came
in
here
a
good
riddance
the
poisoner
has
fabricated
his
pilgrim
staff
to
speak
scientifically
and
perambulated
his
calcareous
strata
what
cut
his
stick
and
walked
his
chalks
and
is
off
to
london
poor
boy
said
the
doctor
much
distressed
do
cry
daddy
you
ca
bring
him
back
again
he
been
gone
these
four
hours
i
went
to
his
room
at
bolus
about
a
little
business
and
saw
at
once
that
he
had
packed
up
and
carried
off
all
he
could
and
looking
about
i
found
a
letter
directed
to
his
father
so
to
his
father
i
took
it
and
really
i
was
sorry
for
the
poor
people
i
left
them
all
crying
in
chorus
i
must
go
to
them
at
once
and
up
rose
the
doctor
he
not
worth
the
trouble
you
take
for
him
the
coxcomb
said
mark
but
it
just
like
your
tom
sit
down
and
finish
the
game
with
me
so
vanished
from
whitbury
with
all
his
aspirations
poor
john
briggs
and
save
an
occasional
letter
to
his
parents
telling
them
that
he
was
alive
and
well
no
one
heard
anything
of
him
for
many
a
year
the
doctor
tried
to
find
him
out
in
london
again
and
again
but
without
success
his
letters
had
no
address
upon
them
and
no
clue
to
his
whereabouts
could
be
found
and
tom
thurnall
went
to
paris
and
became
the
best
and
in
the
quartier
latin
and
then
went
to
mumpsimus
hospital
in
london
and
became
the
best
boxer
therein
and
captain
of
the
besides
winning
prizes
and
certificates
without
end
and
becoming
in
due
time
the
most
popular
in
the
hospital
but
nothing
could
keep
him
permanently
at
home
stay
drudging
in
london
he
would
not
settle
down
in
a
country
practice
he
would
not
cost
his
father
a
farthing
he
would
not
so
he
started
forth
into
the
wide
world
with
nothing
but
his
wits
and
his
science
as
anatomical
professor
to
a
new
college
in
some
south
american
republic
unfortunately
when
he
got
there
he
found
that
the
annual
revolution
had
just
taken
place
and
that
the
party
who
had
founded
the
college
had
been
all
shot
the
week
before
whereat
he
whistled
and
started
off
again
no
man
knew
whither
having
got
round
half
the
world
daddy
he
wrote
home
it
hard
if
i
do
get
round
the
other
half
so
do
expect
me
till
you
see
me
and
take
care
of
your
dear
old
eyes
with
which
he
vanished
into
infinite
space
and
was
only
heard
of
by
occasional
letters
dated
from
the
rocky
mountains
where
he
did
shoot
a
grizzly
bear
the
spanish
west
indies
otahiti
singapore
the
falkland
islands
and
all
manner
of
unexpected
places
sending
home
valuable
notes
sometimes
accompanied
by
valuable
specimens
zoological
and
botanical
and
informing
his
father
that
he
was
doing
very
well
that
work
was
plentiful
and
that
he
always
found
two
fresh
jobs
before
he
had
finished
one
old
one
his
eldest
brother
john
died
meanwhile
his
second
brother
william
was
in
good
general
practice
in
manchester
his
father
connections
supported
him
comfortably
and
if
the
old
doctor
ever
longed
for
tom
to
come
home
he
never
hinted
it
to
the
wanderer
but
bade
him
go
on
and
prosper
and
become
which
he
gave
high
promise
of
becoming
a
distinguished
man
of
science
nevertheless
the
old
man
heart
sank
at
last
when
month
after
month
and
at
last
two
full
years
had
passed
without
any
letter
from
tom
at
last
when
full
four
years
were
past
and
gone
since
tom
started
for
south
america
he
descended
from
the
box
of
the
with
a
serene
and
healthful
countenance
and
with
no
more
look
of
interest
in
his
face
than
if
he
had
been
away
on
a
two
days
visit
shouldered
his
and
started
for
his
father
house
he
stopped
however
as
there
appeared
from
the
inside
of
the
mail
a
face
which
he
must
surely
know
a
second
look
told
him
that
it
was
none
other
than
john
briggs
but
how
altered
he
had
grown
up
into
a
very
handsome
man
tall
and
with
long
black
curls
and
a
black
moustache
there
was
a
slight
stoop
about
his
shoulders
as
of
a
man
accustomed
to
too
much
sitting
and
writing
and
he
carried
an
whether
for
fashion
sake
or
for
his
eyes
sake
was
uncertain
he
was
wrapt
in
a
long
spanish
cloak
new
and
good
wore
trousers
and
what
tom
of
course
examined
carefully
french
boots
very
neat
and
very
thin
moreover
he
had
lavender
on
tom
looked
and
wondered
and
walked
half
round
him
sniffing
like
a
dog
when
he
examines
into
the
character
of
a
fellow
dog
hum
his
mark
seems
to
be
at
present
prosperous
party
so
there
can
be
no
harm
in
renewing
our
acquaintance
what
trade
on
earth
does
he
live
by
though
editor
of
a
newspaper
or
keeper
of
a
begging
his
pardon
he
looks
a
good
deal
more
like
the
latter
than
the
former
however
and
he
walked
up
and
offered
his
hand
with
how
do
briggs
who
would
have
thought
of
our
falling
from
the
skies
against
each
other
in
this
fashion
briggs
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
took
coldly
the
offered
hand
excuse
me
but
the
circumstances
of
my
visit
here
are
too
painful
to
allow
me
to
wish
for
society
and
briggs
withdrew
evidently
glad
to
escape
has
he
vampoosed
with
the
contents
of
a
till
that
he
wishes
so
for
solitude
asked
tom
and
shouldering
his
a
second
time
with
a
grim
inward
laugh
he
went
to
his
father
house
and
hung
up
his
hat
in
the
hall
just
as
if
he
had
come
in
from
a
walk
and
walked
into
the
study
and
not
finding
the
old
man
stepped
through
the
garden
to
mark
armsworth
and
in
at
the
window
frightening
out
of
her
wits
a
short
pale
ugly
girl
of
seventeen
whom
he
discovered
to
be
his
old
playfellow
mary
however
she
soon
recovered
her
equanimity
he
certainly
never
lost
his
how
do
darling
how
you
are
grown
and
how
well
you
look
your
father
i
had
anything
particular
to
do
so
i
thought
i
come
home
and
see
you
all
and
get
some
fishing
and
mary
who
had
longed
to
throw
her
arms
round
his
neck
as
of
old
and
was
restrained
by
the
thought
that
she
was
grown
a
great
girl
now
called
in
her
father
and
all
the
household
and
after
a
while
the
old
doctor
came
home
and
the
fatted
calf
was
killed
and
all
made
merry
over
the
return
of
this
altogether
unrepentant
prodigal
son
who
whether
from
affectation
or
from
that
blunted
sensibility
which
often
comes
by
continual
change
and
wandering
took
all
their
affection
and
delight
with
the
most
provoking
coolness
nevertheless
though
his
feelings
were
not
demonstrative
as
fine
ladies
say
he
evidently
had
some
left
in
some
corner
of
his
heart
for
after
the
fatted
calf
was
eaten
and
they
were
all
settled
in
the
doctor
study
it
came
out
that
his
contained
little
but
presents
and
those
valuable
ones
rare
minerals
from
the
ural
for
his
father
a
pair
of
circassian
pistols
for
mark
and
for
little
mary
to
her
astonishment
a
russian
malachite
bracelet
at
which
mary
eyes
opened
wide
and
old
mark
said
pretty
fellow
you
are
to
go
fooling
your
money
away
like
that
what
did
that
gimcrack
cost
pray
sir
that
is
no
concern
of
yours
sir
or
mine
either
for
i
did
pay
for
it
oh
said
mary
doubtingly
no
mary
i
killed
a
giant
who
was
carrying
off
a
beautiful
princess
and
this
you
see
he
wore
as
a
ring
on
one
of
his
fingers
so
i
thought
it
would
just
suit
your
wrist
oh
tom
thurnall
what
nonsense
come
come
said
his
father
instead
of
telling
us
these
sort
of
stories
you
ought
to
give
an
account
of
yourself
as
you
seem
quite
to
forget
that
we
have
not
heard
from
you
for
more
than
two
years
whew
i
wrote
said
tom
whenever
i
could
however
you
can
have
all
my
letters
in
one
now
so
they
sat
round
the
fire
and
tom
gave
an
account
of
himself
while
his
father
marked
with
pride
that
the
young
man
had
grown
and
strengthened
in
body
and
in
mind
and
that
under
that
nonchalant
almost
cynical
outside
the
heart
still
beat
honest
and
kindly
for
before
tom
began
he
would
needs
draw
his
chair
closer
to
his
father
and
to
him
this
is
very
jolly
i
ca
be
sentimental
you
know
knocking
about
the
world
has
beat
all
that
out
of
me
but
it
is
very
comfortable
after
all
to
find
oneself
with
a
dear
old
daddy
and
a
good
coal
fire
which
of
the
two
could
you
best
do
without
well
one
takes
things
as
one
finds
them
it
do
do
to
look
too
deeply
into
one
feelings
like
chemicals
the
more
you
analyse
them
the
worse
they
smell
so
tom
began
his
story
you
heard
from
me
at
bombay
after
i
been
up
to
the
himalaya
with
an
old
mumpsimus
friend
yes
well
i
worked
my
way
to
suez
on
board
a
ship
whose
doctor
had
fallen
ill
and
then
i
must
needs
see
a
little
of
egypt
and
there
robbed
was
i
and
nearly
murdered
too
but
i
take
a
good
deal
of
killing
i
warrant
you
do
said
mark
looking
at
him
with
pride
so
i
begged
my
way
to
cairo
and
there
i
picked
up
a
yankee
a
new
yorker
made
of
money
who
had
a
yacht
at
alexandria
and
travelled
and
nothing
would
serve
him
but
i
must
go
with
him
to
constantinople
but
there
he
and
i
quarrelled
more
fools
both
of
us
i
wrote
to
you
from
constantinople
we
never
got
the
letter
i
ca
help
that
i
wrote
but
there
i
was
on
the
wide
world
again
so
i
took
up
with
a
russian
prince
whom
i
met
at
a
in
pera
a
mere
boy
but
such
a
plucky
one
and
went
with
him
to
circassia
and
up
to
astrakhan
and
on
to
the
kirghis
steppes
and
there
i
did
see
snakes
snakes
says
mary
i
should
have
thought
you
had
seen
plenty
in
india
already
yes
mary
but
these
were
snakes
spiritual
and
metaphorical
for
poking
about
where
we
had
no
business
mary
the
tartars
caught
us
and
tied
us
to
their
horses
tails
after
giving
me
this
scar
across
the
cheek
and
taught
us
to
drink
mares
milk
and
to
do
a
good
deal
of
dirty
work
beside
so
there
we
stayed
with
them
six
months
and
observed
their
manners
which
were
none
and
their
customs
which
were
disgusting
as
the
midshipman
said
in
his
diary
and
had
the
honour
of
visiting
a
pleasant
little
place
in
land
called
khiva
which
you
may
find
in
your
atlas
mary
and
of
very
nearly
being
sold
for
slaves
into
persia
which
would
not
have
been
pleasant
and
at
last
mary
we
ran
away
or
rather
rode
away
on
two
calmuc
ponies
and
got
back
to
russia
orenberg
for
which
consult
your
atlas
again
so
the
young
prince
was
restored
to
the
bosom
of
his
afflicted
family
and
a
good
deal
of
trouble
i
had
to
get
him
safe
there
for
the
poor
boy
health
gave
way
they
wanted
me
to
stay
with
them
and
offered
to
make
my
fortune
i
so
glad
you
did
said
mary
well
i
wanted
to
see
little
mary
again
and
two
worthy
old
gentlemen
beside
you
see
however
those
russians
are
generous
enough
they
filled
my
pockets
and
heaped
me
with
presents
that
bracelet
among
them
what
more
mary
i
been
introduced
to
old
nick
himself
and
can
testify
from
personal
experience
to
the
correctness
of
shakspeare
opinion
that
the
prince
of
darkness
is
a
gentleman
and
now
you
are
going
to
stay
at
home
asked
the
doctor
well
if
you
take
me
in
daddy
i
send
for
my
traps
from
london
and
stay
a
month
or
so
a
month
cried
the
forlorn
father
well
daddy
you
see
there
is
a
chance
of
more
fighting
in
mexico
and
i
shall
see
such
practice
there
beside
meeting
old
friends
who
were
with
me
in
texas
and
and
i
got
a
little
commission
too
down
in
georgia
that
i
should
like
to
go
and
do
what
is
that
well
it
a
long
story
and
a
sad
one
but
there
was
a
poor
yankee
surgeon
with
the
army
in
circassia
a
southerner
and
a
very
good
fellow
and
he
had
taken
a
fancy
to
some
coloured
girl
at
home
poor
fellow
he
used
to
go
half
mad
about
her
sometimes
when
he
was
talking
to
me
for
fear
she
should
have
been
sold
sent
to
the
new
orleans
market
or
some
other
devilry
and
what
could
i
say
to
comfort
him
well
he
got
his
mittimus
by
one
of
schamyl
bullets
and
when
he
was
dying
he
made
me
promise
i
had
the
heart
to
refuse
to
take
all
his
savings
which
he
had
been
hoarding
for
years
for
no
other
purpose
and
see
if
i
could
buy
the
girl
and
get
her
away
to
canada
i
was
a
fool
for
promising
it
was
no
concern
of
mine
but
the
poor
fellow
would
die
in
peace
else
so
what
must
be
must
oh
go
go
said
mary
you
will
let
him
go
doctor
thurnall
and
see
the
poor
girl
free
think
how
dreadful
it
must
be
to
be
a
slave
i
will
my
little
miss
mary
and
for
more
reasons
than
you
think
of
little
do
you
know
how
dreadful
it
is
to
be
a
slave
hum
said
mark
armsworth
that
a
queer
story
tom
have
you
got
the
poor
fellow
money
did
lose
it
when
you
were
taken
by
those
tartars
not
i
was
so
green
as
to
carry
it
with
me
it
ought
to
have
been
in
england
six
months
ago
my
only
fear
is
it
not
enough
hum
said
mark
how
much
more
do
you
think
you
want
heaven
knows
there
is
a
thousand
dollars
but
if
she
be
half
as
beautiful
as
poor
wyse
used
to
swear
she
was
i
may
want
more
than
double
that
if
you
do
pay
it
and
i
pay
you
again
no
by
george
said
mark
no
one
shall
say
that
while
mark
armsworth
had
a
balance
at
his
bankers
he
let
a
poor
girl
and
recollecting
mary
presence
he
finished
his
sentence
by
sundry
stamps
and
thumps
on
the
table
you
would
soon
exhaust
your
balance
if
you
set
to
work
to
free
all
poor
girls
who
are
in
the
same
case
in
georgia
said
the
doctor
well
what
of
that
them
i
do
know
of
and
so
i
ai
responsible
for
them
but
this
one
i
do
know
of
and
so
there
i
ca
argue
but
tom
if
you
want
the
money
you
know
where
to
find
it
very
good
by
the
by
i
forgot
it
till
this
moment
who
should
come
down
in
the
coach
with
me
but
the
lost
john
briggs
he
is
come
too
late
then
said
the
doctor
his
poor
father
died
this
morning
ah
then
briggs
knew
that
he
was
ill
that
explains
the
manfredic
mystery
and
gloom
with
which
he
greeted
me
i
can
not
tell
he
has
written
from
time
to
time
but
he
has
never
given
any
address
so
that
no
one
could
write
in
return
he
may
have
known
he
looked
very
downcast
perhaps
that
explains
his
cutting
me
dead
cut
you
cried
mark
i
dare
say
he
been
doing
something
ashamed
of
and
do
want
to
be
recognised
that
fellow
has
been
after
no
good
all
this
while
i
warrant
i
always
say
connected
with
the
swell
mob
or
croupier
at
a
or
something
of
that
kind
do
you
think
it
likely
now
mark
was
in
the
habit
of
so
saying
for
the
purpose
of
tormenting
the
doctor
who
held
stoutly
to
his
old
belief
that
john
briggs
was
a
very
clever
man
and
would
turn
up
some
day
as
a
distinguished
literary
character
well
said
tom
honest
or
not
he
thriving
came
down
inside
the
coach
dressed
in
the
distinguished
foreigner
style
with
lavender
kid
gloves
and
french
boots
just
like
a
swell
pickpocket
said
mark
i
always
told
you
so
thurnall
he
had
the
old
byron
collar
and
raphael
hair
though
nasty
effeminate
foppery
grumbled
mark
so
he
may
be
in
the
scribbling
line
after
all
i
go
and
see
if
i
can
find
him
quoth
the
doctor
bother
you
said
mark
always
running
out
o
nights
after
somebody
else
business
instead
of
having
a
jolly
evening
you
stay
tom
like
a
sensible
fellow
and
tell
me
and
mary
some
more
lies
had
much
sporting
boy
hum
i
shot
and
hunted
every
beast
i
think
shootable
and
huntable
from
a
to
an
elephant
and
i
had
some
splendid
fishing
in
canada
but
after
all
give
me
a
whitbury
trout
on
a
chevalier
we
at
them
mr
armsworth
we
will
my
boy
never
so
many
fish
in
the
river
as
this
year
or
in
season
so
early
the
good
doctor
returned
but
with
no
news
which
could
throw
light
on
the
history
of
the
now
mysterious
john
briggs
he
had
locked
himself
into
the
room
with
his
father
corpse
evidently
in
great
excitement
and
grief
spent
several
hours
in
walking
up
and
down
there
alone
and
had
then
gone
to
an
attorney
in
the
town
and
settled
everything
about
the
funeral
in
the
handsomest
way
said
the
man
of
law
and
was
quite
the
gentleman
in
his
manner
but
not
much
of
a
man
of
business
never
had
even
thought
of
looking
for
his
father
will
and
was
quite
surprised
when
i
told
him
that
there
ought
to
be
a
fair
sum
eight
hundred
or
a
thousand
perhaps
to
come
in
to
him
if
the
stock
and
business
were
properly
disposed
of
so
he
went
off
to
london
by
the
evening
mail
and
told
me
to
address
him
to
the
in
some
street
off
the
strand
queer
business
sir
is
it
john
briggs
did
not
reappear
till
a
few
minutes
before
his
funeral
witnessed
the
ceremony
evidently
with
great
sorrow
bowed
off
silently
all
who
attempted
to
speak
to
him
and
returned
to
london
by
the
next
coach
leaving
matter
for
much
babble
among
all
whitbury
gossips
one
thing
at
least
was
plain
that
he
wished
to
be
forgotten
in
his
native
town
and
forgotten
he
was
in
due
course
of
time
tom
thurnall
stayed
his
month
at
home
and
then
went
to
america
whence
he
wrote
home
in
about
six
months
a
letter
of
which
only
one
paragraph
need
interest
us
tell
mark
i
have
no
need
for
his
dollars
i
have
done
the
deed
and
thanks
to
the
underground
railway
done
it
nearly
gratis
which
was
both
cheaper
than
buying
her
and
infinitely
better
for
me
so
that
she
has
all
poor
wyse
dollars
to
start
with
afresh
in
canada
i
write
this
from
new
york
i
could
accompany
her
no
farther
for
i
must
get
back
to
the
south
in
time
for
the
mexican
expedition
then
came
a
long
and
anxious
silence
and
then
a
letter
not
from
mexico
but
from
california
one
out
of
several
which
had
been
posted
and
then
letters
more
regularly
from
australia
sickened
with
californian
life
he
had
crossed
the
pacific
once
more
and
was
hard
at
work
in
the
diggings
doctoring
and
by
turns
a
rolling
stone
gathers
no
moss
said
his
father
he
has
the
pluck
of
a
hound
and
the
cunning
of
a
fox
said
mark
and
he
be
a
credit
to
you
yet
and
mary
prayed
every
morning
and
night
for
her
old
playfellow
and
so
the
years
slipped
on
till
the
autumn
of
as
no
one
has
heard
of
tom
now
for
eight
months
and
more
the
pulse
of
australian
postage
being
of
a
somewhat
intermittent
type
we
may
as
well
go
and
look
for
him
a
sheet
of
dark
rolling
ground
quarried
into
a
gigantic
rabbit
burrow
with
hundreds
of
tents
and
huts
dotted
about
among
the
heaps
of
rubbish
dark
evergreen
forests
in
the
distance
and
above
all
the
great
volcanic
mountain
of
buninyong
towering
far
aloft
these
are
the
black
hills
of
ballarat
and
that
windlass
at
that
shaft
mouth
belongs
in
part
to
thomas
thurnall
at
the
windlass
are
standing
two
men
whom
we
may
have
seen
in
past
years
in
countenance
and
spotless
in
array
sauntering
down
piccadilly
any
july
afternoon
or
lounging
in
at
cambridge
any
autumn
morning
alas
how
changed
from
the
fast
young
undergraduates
with
powers
of
enjoyment
only
equalled
by
their
powers
of
running
into
debt
are
those
two
and
ruffians
who
once
were
smith
and
brown
of
trinity
yet
who
need
pity
them
as
long
as
they
have
stouter
limbs
healthier
stomachs
and
clearer
consciences
than
they
have
had
since
they
left
eton
at
seventeen
would
smith
have
been
a
happier
man
as
a
briefless
barrister
in
a
dingy
inn
of
law
peeping
now
and
then
into
london
society
and
scribbling
for
the
daily
press
would
brown
have
been
a
happier
man
had
he
been
forced
into
those
holy
orders
for
which
he
never
felt
the
least
vocation
to
pay
off
his
college
debts
out
of
his
curate
income
and
settle
down
on
his
lees
at
last
in
the
family
living
of
and
support
a
wife
and
five
children
on
five
hundred
exclusive
of
rates
and
taxes
let
them
dig
and
be
men
the
windlass
rattles
and
the
rope
goes
down
a
shout
from
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
proclaims
all
right
and
in
due
time
sitting
in
the
noose
of
the
rope
up
comes
thomas
thurnall
and
in
flannel
trousers
and
red
jersey
begrimed
with
slush
and
mud
with
a
mahogany
face
a
neck
and
a
huge
brown
beard
looking
to
use
his
own
expression
as
jolly
as
a
sandboy
a
letter
for
you
doctor
from
europe
tom
takes
it
and
his
countenance
falls
for
it
is
and
the
handwriting
is
mary
armsworth
i
suppose
the
old
lady
who
is
going
to
leave
me
a
fortune
is
dead
says
he
drily
and
turns
away
to
read
bad
luck
i
suppose
he
says
to
himself
i
have
not
had
any
for
full
six
months
so
i
suppose
it
is
time
for
dame
fortune
to
give
me
a
sly
stab
again
i
only
hope
it
is
not
my
father
for
begging
the
dame
pardon
i
can
bear
any
trick
of
hers
but
that
and
he
sets
his
teeth
doggedly
and
reads
my
dear
thurnall
my
father
would
have
written
himself
but
he
thought
i
do
know
why
that
i
could
tell
you
better
than
he
your
father
is
quite
well
in
health
thurnall
breathes
freely
again
but
he
has
had
heavy
trials
since
your
poor
brother
william
death
tom
opens
his
eyes
and
sets
his
teeth
more
firmly
willy
dead
i
suppose
there
is
a
letter
lost
better
so
better
to
have
the
whole
list
of
troubles
together
and
so
get
them
sooner
over
poor
will
your
father
caught
the
scarlet
fever
from
him
while
he
was
attending
him
and
was
very
ill
after
he
came
back
he
is
quite
well
again
now
but
if
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
the
disease
has
affected
his
eyes
you
know
how
weak
they
always
were
and
how
much
worse
they
have
grown
of
late
years
and
the
doctors
are
afraid
that
he
has
little
chance
of
recovering
the
sight
at
least
of
the
left
eye
recovering
he
blind
then
and
tom
set
his
teeth
more
tightly
than
ever
he
felt
a
sob
rise
in
his
throat
but
choked
it
down
shaking
his
head
like
an
impatient
bull
wait
a
bit
tom
said
he
to
himself
before
you
have
it
out
with
dame
fortune
there
more
behind
i
warrant
news
like
this
lies
in
pockets
and
not
in
single
nuggets
and
he
read
on
and
for
it
is
better
you
should
know
all
something
has
happened
to
the
railroad
in
which
he
had
invested
so
much
my
father
has
lost
money
in
it
also
but
not
much
but
i
fear
that
your
poor
dear
father
is
very
much
straitened
my
father
is
dreadfully
vexed
about
it
and
thinks
it
all
his
fault
in
not
having
watched
the
matter
more
closely
and
made
your
father
sell
out
in
time
and
he
wants
your
father
to
come
and
live
with
us
but
he
will
not
hear
of
it
so
he
has
given
up
the
old
house
and
taken
one
in
water
street
and
oh
i
need
not
tell
you
that
we
are
there
every
day
and
that
i
am
trying
to
make
him
as
happy
as
i
can
but
what
can
i
do
and
then
followed
kind
womanly
commonplaces
which
tom
hurried
over
with
fierce
impatience
he
wants
you
to
come
home
but
my
father
has
entreated
him
to
let
you
stay
you
know
while
we
are
here
he
is
safe
and
my
father
begs
you
not
to
come
home
if
you
are
succeeding
as
well
as
you
have
been
doing
there
was
much
more
in
the
letter
which
i
need
not
repeat
and
after
all
a
short
postscript
by
mark
himself
followed
stay
where
you
are
boy
and
keep
up
heart
while
i
have
a
pound
your
father
shall
have
half
of
it
and
you
know
mark
armsworth
he
walked
away
slowly
into
the
forest
he
felt
that
the
crisis
of
his
life
was
come
that
he
must
turn
his
hand
henceforth
to
quite
new
work
and
as
he
went
he
took
stock
as
it
were
of
his
own
soul
to
see
what
point
he
had
attained
what
he
could
do
fifteen
years
of
adventure
had
hardened
into
wrought
metal
a
character
never
very
ductile
tom
was
now
in
his
own
way
an
altogether
accomplished
man
of
the
world
who
knew
at
least
in
all
companies
and
places
where
he
was
likely
to
find
himself
exactly
what
to
say
to
do
to
make
to
seek
and
to
avoid
shifty
and
thrifty
as
old
greek
or
modern
scot
there
were
few
things
he
could
not
invent
and
perhaps
nothing
he
could
not
endure
he
had
watched
human
nature
under
every
disguise
from
the
pomp
of
the
ambassador
to
the
of
the
savage
and
formed
his
own
clear
hard
shallow
practical
estimate
thereof
he
looked
on
it
as
his
raw
material
which
he
had
to
work
up
into
subsistence
and
comfort
for
himself
he
did
not
wish
to
live
on
men
but
live
by
them
he
must
and
for
that
purpose
he
must
study
them
and
especially
their
weaknesses
he
would
not
cheat
them
for
there
was
in
him
an
innate
vein
of
honesty
so
surly
and
explosive
at
times
as
to
give
him
much
trouble
the
severest
part
of
his
had
been
the
repression
of
his
dangerous
inclination
to
call
a
sham
a
sham
on
the
spot
and
to
answer
fools
according
to
their
folly
that
youthful
rashness
however
was
now
subdued
and
tom
could
flatter
and
bully
also
when
it
served
his
turn
as
who
can
not
let
him
that
is
without
sin
among
my
readers
cast
the
first
stone
he
was
therefore
in
every
word
and
action
not
from
morbid
vanity
but
a
necessary
consequence
of
his
mode
of
life
he
had
to
use
men
and
therefore
to
watch
how
he
used
them
to
watch
every
word
gesture
tone
of
voice
and
in
all
times
and
places
do
the
fitting
thing
it
was
hard
work
but
necessary
for
a
man
who
stood
alone
and
in
the
midst
of
the
universe
fashioning
for
himself
everywhere
just
as
far
as
his
arm
could
reach
some
not
intolerable
condition
depending
on
nothing
but
himself
and
caring
for
little
but
himself
and
the
father
whom
to
do
him
justice
he
never
forgot
if
i
wished
to
define
tom
thurnall
by
one
epithet
i
should
call
him
specially
an
ungodly
man
were
it
not
that
scriptural
epithets
have
such
altogether
conventional
and
official
meanings
that
one
fears
to
convey
in
using
them
some
notion
quite
foreign
to
the
truth
tom
was
certainly
not
one
of
those
ungodly
whom
david
had
to
deal
with
of
old
who
robbed
the
widow
and
put
the
fatherless
to
death
his
morality
was
as
high
as
that
of
the
average
his
sense
of
honour
far
higher
he
was
generous
and
no
one
ever
heard
him
tell
a
lie
and
he
had
a
blunt
honesty
about
him
half
real
because
he
liked
to
be
honest
and
yet
half
affected
too
because
he
found
it
pay
in
the
long
run
and
because
it
threw
off
their
guard
the
people
whom
he
intended
to
make
his
tools
but
of
godliness
in
its
true
sense
of
belief
that
any
being
above
cared
for
him
and
was
helping
him
in
the
daily
business
of
life
that
it
was
worth
while
asking
that
being
advice
or
that
any
advice
would
be
given
if
asked
for
of
any
practical
notion
of
a
heavenly
father
or
a
divine
education
tom
was
as
ignorant
as
thousands
of
respectable
people
who
go
to
church
every
sunday
and
read
good
books
and
believe
firmly
that
the
pope
is
antichrist
he
ought
to
have
learnt
it
no
doubt
for
his
father
was
a
religious
man
but
he
had
not
learnt
it
any
more
than
thousands
learn
it
who
have
likewise
religious
parents
he
had
been
taught
of
course
the
common
doctrines
and
duties
of
religion
but
early
remembrances
had
been
rubbed
out
as
off
a
schoolboy
slate
by
the
mere
current
of
new
thoughts
and
objects
in
his
continual
wanderings
disappointments
he
had
had
and
dangers
in
plenty
but
only
such
as
rouse
a
brave
and
cheerful
spirit
to
bolder
and
invention
not
those
deep
sorrows
of
the
heart
which
leave
a
man
helpless
in
the
lowest
pit
crying
for
help
from
without
for
there
is
none
within
he
had
seen
men
of
all
creeds
and
had
found
in
all
alike
so
he
held
the
many
rogues
and
the
few
honest
men
all
religions
were
in
his
eyes
equally
true
and
equally
false
superior
morality
was
owing
principally
to
the
influences
of
race
and
climate
and
devotional
experiences
to
judge
at
least
from
american
and
the
results
of
a
diseased
nervous
system
upon
a
man
so
hard
and
strong
this
fearful
blow
had
fallen
and
to
do
him
justice
he
took
it
like
a
man
he
wandered
on
and
on
for
an
hour
or
more
up
the
hills
and
into
the
forest
talking
to
himself
poor
old
willy
i
should
have
liked
to
have
looked
into
his
honest
face
before
he
went
if
only
to
make
sure
that
we
were
good
friends
i
used
to
plague
him
sadly
with
my
tricks
but
what
is
the
use
of
wishing
for
what
can
not
be
i
recollect
i
had
just
the
same
feeling
when
john
died
and
yet
i
got
over
it
after
a
time
and
was
as
cheerful
as
if
he
were
alive
again
or
had
never
lived
at
all
and
so
i
shall
get
over
this
why
should
i
give
way
to
what
i
know
will
pass
and
is
meant
to
pass
it
is
my
father
i
feel
for
but
i
could
be
there
and
it
is
no
fault
of
mine
that
i
was
not
there
no
one
told
me
what
was
going
to
happen
and
no
one
could
know
so
again
why
grieve
over
what
ca
be
helped
and
then
to
give
the
lie
to
all
his
cool
arguments
he
sat
down
among
the
fern
and
burst
into
a
violent
fit
of
crying
oh
my
poor
dear
old
daddy
yes
beneath
all
the
hard
crust
of
years
that
fountain
of
life
still
lay
pure
as
when
it
came
down
from
heaven
love
for
his
father
come
come
this
wo
do
this
is
not
the
way
to
take
stock
of
my
goods
either
mental
or
worldly
i
ca
cry
the
dear
old
man
out
of
this
scrape
he
looked
up
the
sun
was
setting
beneath
the
dark
roof
of
evergreens
the
eucalyptus
boles
stood
out
like
basalt
pillars
black
against
a
background
of
burning
flame
the
flying
foxes
shot
from
tree
to
tree
and
moths
as
big
as
sparrows
whirred
about
the
trunks
one
moment
black
against
the
glare
beyond
and
vanishing
the
next
like
imps
of
darkness
into
their
native
gloom
there
was
no
sound
of
living
thing
around
save
the
ghastly
rattle
of
the
dead
which
swung
from
every
tree
and
far
away
the
faint
clicking
of
the
diggers
at
their
work
like
the
rustle
of
a
gigantic
was
there
one
among
them
all
who
cared
for
him
who
would
not
forget
him
in
a
week
with
well
he
was
pleasant
company
poor
fellow
and
go
on
digging
without
a
sigh
what
if
it
were
his
fate
to
die
as
he
had
seen
many
a
stronger
man
there
in
that
lonely
wilderness
and
sleep
for
ever
unhonoured
and
unknown
beneath
that
awful
forest
roof
while
his
father
looked
for
bread
to
others
hands
no
man
was
less
sentimental
no
man
less
superstitious
than
thomas
thurnall
but
crushed
and
softened
all
but
terrified
as
who
would
not
have
been
by
that
day
news
he
could
not
struggle
against
the
weight
of
loneliness
which
fell
upon
him
for
the
first
and
last
time
perhaps
in
his
life
he
felt
fear
a
vague
awful
dread
of
unseen
and
inevitable
possibilities
why
should
not
calamity
fall
on
him
wave
after
wave
was
it
not
falling
on
him
already
why
should
he
not
grow
sick
break
his
leg
his
neck
why
not
what
guarantee
had
he
in
earth
or
heaven
that
he
might
not
be
snuffed
out
silently
as
he
had
seen
hundreds
already
and
die
and
leave
no
sign
and
there
sprang
up
in
him
at
once
the
intensest
yearning
after
his
father
and
the
haunts
of
his
boyhood
and
the
wildest
dread
that
he
should
never
see
them
might
not
his
father
be
dead
ere
he
could
return
if
ever
he
did
return
that
twelve
thousand
miles
of
sea
looked
to
him
a
gulf
impassable
oh
that
he
were
safe
at
home
that
he
could
start
that
moment
and
for
one
minute
a
helplessness
as
of
a
lost
child
came
over
him
perhaps
it
had
been
well
for
him
had
he
given
that
feeling
vent
and
confessing
himself
a
lost
child
cried
out
of
the
darkness
to
a
father
but
the
next
minute
he
had
dashed
it
proudly
away
pretty
baby
i
am
to
get
frightened
at
my
time
of
life
because
i
find
myself
in
a
dark
wood
and
the
sun
shining
all
the
while
as
jollily
as
ever
away
there
in
the
west
it
is
morning
somewhere
or
other
now
and
it
will
be
morning
here
again
times
and
bad
times
and
all
times
pass
over
i
learnt
that
lesson
out
of
old
bewick
vignettes
and
it
has
stood
me
in
good
stead
this
many
a
year
and
shall
now
die
nonsense
i
take
more
killing
than
that
comes
to
so
for
one
more
bout
with
old
dame
fortune
if
she
throws
me
again
why
i
get
up
again
as
i
have
any
time
these
fifteen
years
mark
right
i
stay
here
and
work
till
i
make
a
hit
or
luck
runs
dry
and
then
home
and
settle
and
meanwhile
i
go
down
to
melbourne
and
send
the
dear
old
man
two
hundred
pounds
and
then
back
again
here
and
to
it
again
and
with
a
smile
half
bitter
and
half
cheerful
tom
rose
and
went
down
again
to
his
mates
and
stopped
their
inquiries
by
what
done
ca
be
mended
and
need
be
mentioned
whining
wo
make
me
work
the
harder
and
harder
than
ever
i
must
work
strange
it
is
how
mortal
man
who
cometh
up
and
is
cut
down
like
the
flower
can
thus
harden
himself
into
stoical
security
and
count
on
the
morrow
which
may
never
come
yet
so
it
is
and
perhaps
if
it
were
not
so
no
work
would
get
done
on
earth
at
least
by
the
many
who
know
not
that
god
is
guiding
them
while
they
fancy
that
they
are
guiding
themselves
chapter
ii
still
life
i
must
now
if
i
am
to
bring
you
to
two
years
ago
and
to
my
story
as
it
was
told
to
me
ask
you
to
follow
me
into
the
good
old
west
country
and
set
you
down
at
the
back
of
an
old
harbour
pier
thirty
feet
of
grey
and
brown
boulders
spotted
aloft
with
bright
yellow
lichens
and
black
drops
of
tar
polished
lower
down
by
the
surge
of
centuries
and
towards
the
foot
of
the
wall
roughened
with
crusts
of
barnacles
and
in
crack
and
cranny
and
festoons
of
coarse
dripping
weed
on
a
low
rock
at
its
foot
her
back
resting
against
the
cyclopean
wall
sits
a
young
woman
of
soberly
almost
primly
dressed
with
three
or
four
tiny
children
clustering
round
her
in
front
of
them
on
a
narrow
spit
of
sand
between
the
rocks
a
dozen
little
girls
are
laughing
romping
and
pattering
about
turning
the
stones
for
shannies
and
bullies
and
other
luckless
fish
left
by
the
tide
while
the
party
beneath
the
pier
wall
look
steadfastly
down
into
a
little
at
their
feet
full
of
the
pink
and
green
and
purple
of
delicate
weeds
and
coralline
and
starred
with
great
crimson
and
brown
and
grey
and
with
the
waving
of
the
cercus
pale
blue
and
like
the
fingers
of
the
dawn
one
delicate
medusa
is
sliding
across
the
pool
by
slow
pantings
of
its
crystal
bell
and
on
it
the
eyes
of
the
whole
group
are
fixed
for
it
seems
to
be
the
subject
of
some
story
which
the
village
schoolmistress
is
finishing
in
a
sweet
voice
and
so
the
cruel
soldier
was
changed
into
a
great
rough
red
starfish
who
goes
about
killing
the
poor
mussels
while
nobody
loves
him
or
cares
to
take
his
part
and
the
poor
little
girl
was
changed
into
a
beautiful
bright
like
that
one
who
swims
about
all
day
in
the
pleasant
sunshine
with
a
red
cross
stamped
on
its
heart
oh
mistress
what
a
pretty
story
cry
the
little
ones
with
tearful
eyes
and
what
shall
we
be
changed
to
when
we
die
if
we
will
only
be
good
we
shall
go
up
to
jesus
and
be
beautiful
angels
and
sing
hymns
would
that
it
might
be
soon
soon
for
you
and
me
and
all
and
she
draws
the
children
to
her
and
looks
upward
as
if
longing
to
bear
them
with
her
aloft
let
us
leave
the
conversation
where
it
is
and
look
into
the
face
of
the
speaker
who
young
as
she
is
has
already
meditated
so
long
upon
the
mystery
of
death
that
it
has
grown
lovely
in
her
eyes
her
figure
is
tall
graceful
and
slight
the
severity
of
its
outlines
suiting
well
with
the
severity
of
her
dress
with
the
brown
stuff
gown
and
plain
grey
whittle
her
neck
is
long
almost
too
long
but
all
defects
are
forgotten
in
the
first
look
at
her
face
we
can
see
it
fully
for
her
bonnet
lies
beside
her
on
the
rock
the
masque
though
thin
is
perfect
the
brow
like
that
of
greek
statue
looks
lower
than
it
really
is
for
the
hair
springs
from
below
the
bend
of
the
forehead
the
brain
is
very
long
and
sweeps
backward
and
upward
in
grand
curves
till
it
attains
above
the
ears
a
great
expanse
and
height
she
should
be
a
character
more
able
to
feel
than
to
argue
full
of
all
a
woman
veneration
devotion
love
of
children
perhaps
too
of
a
woman
anxiety
the
nose
is
slightly
aquiline
the
nostrils
indicate
a
reserve
of
compressed
strength
and
passion
the
mouth
is
delicate
the
lips
which
are
full
and
somewhat
heavy
not
from
coarseness
but
rather
from
languor
show
somewhat
of
both
the
upper
and
the
under
teeth
her
eyes
are
bent
on
the
pool
at
her
feet
so
that
we
can
see
nothing
of
them
but
the
large
sleepy
lids
fringed
with
lashes
so
long
and
dark
that
the
eye
looks
as
if
it
had
been
painted
in
the
eastern
fashion
with
antimony
the
dark
lashes
dark
eyebrows
dark
hair
crisped
as
hair
so
often
is
to
its
very
roots
increase
the
almost
ghostlike
paleness
of
the
face
not
sallow
not
but
of
a
clear
bloodless
waxen
hue
and
now
she
lifts
her
eyes
dark
eyes
of
preternatural
largeness
brilliant
too
but
not
with
the
sparkle
of
the
diamond
brilliant
as
deep
clear
wells
are
in
which
the
mellow
moonlight
sleeps
between
black
walls
of
rock
and
round
them
and
round
the
lips
and
arching
eyebrow
and
slightly
wrinkled
forehead
hangs
an
air
of
melancholy
thought
vague
doubt
almost
of
startled
fear
then
that
expression
passes
and
the
whole
face
collapses
into
a
languor
of
patient
sadness
which
seems
to
say
i
can
not
solve
the
mystery
let
him
solve
it
as
seems
good
to
him
the
pier
has
as
usual
two
stages
the
upper
and
narrower
for
a
public
promenade
the
lower
and
broader
one
for
business
two
rough
strangers
to
the
place
are
lounging
on
the
wall
above
and
begin
out
of
mere
mischief
dropping
pebbles
on
the
group
below
hillo
you
young
rascals
calls
an
old
man
lounging
like
them
on
the
wall
if
you
do
drop
that
you
likely
to
get
your
heads
broken
will
you
do
it
i
would
thirty
years
ago
but
i
find
a
dozen
in
five
minutes
who
will
do
it
now
here
lads
here
two
welsh
vagabonds
pelting
our
schoolmistress
this
is
spoken
to
a
group
of
who
are
sitting
about
on
the
behind
him
in
red
caps
blue
jackets
striped
jerseys
bright
brown
trousers
and
all
the
picturesque
comfort
of
a
fisherman
costume
superintending
the
mending
of
a
boat
up
jump
off
the
logs
and
baulkings
where
they
have
been
squatting
doubled
up
knee
to
nose
after
the
fashion
of
their
class
and
a
volley
of
execrations
like
a
storm
of
grape
almost
blows
the
two
offenders
off
the
wall
the
bolder
however
lingers
anathematising
in
turn
whereon
a
youth
some
six
feet
four
in
height
catches
up
an
oar
makes
a
sweep
at
the
shins
of
the
lad
above
his
head
and
brings
him
writhing
down
upon
the
upper
whence
he
walks
off
howling
and
muttering
threats
of
taking
the
law
in
vain
there
is
not
a
magistrate
within
ten
miles
and
custom
and
the
lieutenant
settle
all
matters
in
aberalva
town
and
do
so
easily
enough
for
the
petty
crimes
which
fill
our
gaols
are
all
unknown
among
those
honest
vikings
sons
and
any
man
who
covets
his
neighbour
goods
instead
of
stealing
them
has
only
to
go
and
borrow
them
on
condition
of
course
of
lending
in
his
turn
what
that
hollering
about
captain
willis
asks
tardrew
steward
to
lord
scoutbush
landlord
of
aberalva
as
he
comes
up
to
the
old
man
gentleman
jan
cut
him
over
for
pelting
the
schoolmistress
below
here
serve
him
right
he
have
to
cut
over
that
curate
next
i
reckon
oh
tardrew
do
you
talk
so
the
young
gentleman
is
as
kind
a
man
as
i
ever
saw
and
comes
in
and
out
of
our
house
like
a
lamb
wolf
in
sheep
clothing
growls
tardrew
what
d
think
he
says
to
me
last
week
wanted
to
turn
the
schoolmistress
out
of
her
place
because
she
went
to
chapel
sometimes
i
know
i
know
replied
willis
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
wished
to
avoid
a
painful
subject
and
what
did
you
answer
then
mr
tardrew
i
told
him
he
might
if
he
liked
but
he
make
the
place
too
hot
to
hold
him
if
he
had
done
it
already
with
his
bowings
and
his
crossings
and
his
chantings
and
his
popish
gregories
and
tells
one
he
no
papist
called
him
pope
gregory
himself
what
do
we
want
with
popes
tunes
here
instead
of
the
old
hundredth
and
martyrdom
i
should
like
to
see
any
pope
of
the
lot
make
a
tune
like
them
captain
willis
listened
with
a
face
half
sad
half
slily
amused
he
and
tardrew
were
old
friends
being
the
two
most
notable
persons
in
the
parish
save
jones
the
lieutenant
heale
the
doctor
and
another
gentleman
of
whom
we
shall
speak
presently
both
of
them
too
were
protestants
and
though
churchmen
walked
sometimes
into
the
brianite
chapel
of
an
afternoon
and
thought
it
no
sin
but
each
took
the
curate
puseyism
in
a
different
way
being
two
men
as
unlike
each
other
as
one
could
well
find
tardrew
steward
to
lord
scoutbush
the
absentee
landlord
was
a
shrewd
choleric
old
fellow
of
the
shape
colour
and
consistence
of
a
red
brick
one
of
those
english
types
which
emerson
has
so
well
hit
off
in
his
rather
confused
and
contradictory
traits
he
hides
virtues
under
vices
or
rather
under
the
semblance
of
them
it
is
the
misshapen
hairy
scandinavian
troll
again
who
lifts
the
cart
out
of
the
mire
or
threshes
the
corn
which
ten
could
not
end
but
it
is
done
in
the
dark
and
with
muttered
maledictions
he
is
a
churl
with
a
soft
place
in
his
heart
whose
speech
is
a
brash
of
bitter
waters
but
who
loves
to
help
you
at
a
pinch
he
says
no
and
serves
you
and
his
thanks
disgust
you
such
was
tardrew
a
true
british
bulldog
who
lived
pretty
faithfully
up
to
his
old
testament
but
had
somehow
forgotten
the
existence
of
the
new
willis
was
a
very
different
and
a
very
much
nobler
person
the
most
perfect
specimen
which
i
ever
have
met
for
i
knew
him
well
and
loved
him
of
that
type
of
british
sailor
which
good
captain
marryat
has
painted
in
his
masterman
ready
and
painted
far
better
than
i
can
even
though
i
do
so
from
life
a
tall
and
graceful
old
man
though
stooping
much
from
lumbago
and
old
wounds
with
hair
and
whiskers
delicate
aquiline
features
the
manners
of
a
nobleman
and
the
heart
of
a
child
all
children
knew
that
latter
fact
and
clung
to
him
instinctively
even
the
boys
that
terrible
and
bound
together
in
common
iniquities
and
the
dread
of
common
retribution
who
were
in
aberalva
as
all
fishing
towns
the
torment
and
terror
of
all
douce
fogies
male
and
female
even
the
boys
i
say
respected
captain
willis
so
potent
was
the
influence
of
his
gentleness
nailed
not
up
his
shutters
nor
tied
across
his
doorway
not
his
dog
nor
sent
his
cat
to
sea
on
a
nor
put
live
crabs
into
his
pocket
nor
dead
into
his
well
yea
even
when
judgment
too
long
provoked
made
bare
her
red
right
hand
and
the
lieutenant
vowed
by
his
commission
that
he
would
send
of
them
to
the
treadmill
they
would
send
up
a
deputation
to
beg
captain
willis
to
beg
the
schoolmistress
to
beg
them
off
for
between
willis
and
that
fair
young
creature
a
friendship
had
grown
up
easily
to
be
understood
willis
was
one
of
those
rare
natures
upon
whose
purity
no
mire
can
cling
who
pass
through
the
furnace
and
yet
not
even
the
smell
of
fire
has
passed
upon
them
bred
almost
born
on
board
a
smuggling
cutter
in
the
old
then
hunting
in
the
old
service
the
smugglers
among
whom
he
had
been
trained
watching
the
slow
horrors
of
the
walcheren
fighting
under
collingwood
and
nelson
and
many
another
valiant
captain
lounging
away
years
of
temptation
on
the
station
as
of
a
pensioned
comfortably
now
for
many
a
year
in
his
native
town
he
had
been
always
the
same
gentle
valiant
righteous
man
sober
in
life
strict
in
duty
and
simple
in
word
a
soul
as
transparent
as
crystal
and
as
pure
he
was
the
oracle
of
aberalva
now
and
even
lieutenant
brown
would
ask
his
opinion
officer
though
he
was
in
a
tone
which
was
all
the
more
patronising
because
he
stood
a
little
in
awe
of
the
old
man
but
why
when
the
boys
wanted
to
be
begged
off
was
the
schoolmistress
to
be
their
advocate
because
grace
harvey
exercised
without
intending
anything
of
the
kind
an
almost
mesmeric
influence
on
every
one
in
the
little
town
goodness
rather
than
talent
had
given
her
wisdom
and
goodness
rather
than
courage
a
power
of
using
that
wisdom
which
to
those
simple
superstitious
folk
seemed
altogether
an
inspiration
there
was
a
mystery
about
her
too
which
worked
strongly
on
the
hearts
of
the
people
she
was
supposed
to
be
at
times
not
right
and
wandering
intellect
is
with
them
as
with
many
primitive
peoples
an
object
more
of
awe
than
of
pity
her
deep
melancholy
alternated
with
bursts
of
wild
eloquence
with
fantastic
fables
with
entreaties
and
warnings
against
sin
full
of
such
pity
and
pathos
that
they
melted
at
times
the
hardest
hearts
a
whole
world
of
strange
tales
half
false
half
true
had
grown
up
around
her
as
she
grew
she
was
believed
to
spend
whole
nights
in
prayer
to
speak
with
visitors
from
the
other
world
even
to
have
the
power
of
seeing
into
futurity
the
intensity
of
her
imagination
gave
rise
to
the
belief
that
she
had
only
to
will
and
she
could
see
whom
she
would
and
all
that
they
were
doing
even
across
the
seas
her
exquisite
sensibility
it
was
whispered
made
her
feel
every
bodily
suffering
she
witnessed
as
acutely
as
the
sufferer
self
and
in
the
very
limb
in
which
he
suffered
her
deep
melancholy
was
believed
to
be
caused
by
some
dark
fate
by
some
agonising
sympathy
with
and
it
was
sometimes
said
in
aberalva
do
do
that
for
poor
grace
sake
she
bears
the
sins
of
all
the
parish
so
it
befell
that
grace
harvey
governed
she
knew
not
how
or
why
all
hearts
in
that
wild
simple
rough
men
fighting
on
the
quay
shook
hands
at
grace
bidding
wives
who
could
not
lure
their
husbands
from
the
sent
grace
in
to
fetch
them
home
sobered
by
shame
and
woe
to
the
stranger
who
fancied
that
her
entrance
into
that
noisy
den
gave
him
a
right
to
say
a
rough
word
to
the
fair
girl
the
maidens
instead
of
envying
her
beauty
made
her
the
confidant
of
all
their
loves
for
though
many
a
man
would
gladly
have
married
her
to
woo
her
was
more
than
any
dared
and
gentleman
jan
himself
the
rightful
bully
of
the
quay
as
being
the
handsomest
and
biggest
man
for
many
a
mile
beside
owning
a
tidy
trawler
and
two
good
had
said
openly
that
if
any
man
had
a
right
to
her
he
supposed
he
had
but
that
he
should
as
soon
think
of
asking
her
to
marry
him
as
of
asking
the
moon
but
it
was
in
the
school
in
the
duty
which
lay
nearest
to
her
that
grace
inward
loveliness
shone
most
lovely
whatever
dark
cloud
of
melancholy
lay
upon
her
own
heart
she
took
care
that
it
should
never
overshadow
one
of
those
young
innocents
whom
she
taught
by
love
and
ruled
by
love
always
tender
always
cheerful
even
gay
and
playful
punishing
when
she
rarely
punished
with
tears
and
kisses
to
make
them
as
happy
as
she
could
in
a
world
where
there
was
nothing
but
temptation
and
disappointment
and
misery
to
make
them
fit
for
heaven
and
then
to
pray
that
they
might
go
thither
as
speedily
as
possible
this
had
been
her
work
for
now
seven
years
and
that
manichaeism
which
has
driven
darker
and
harder
natures
to
destroy
young
children
that
they
might
go
straight
to
bliss
took
in
her
the
form
of
outpourings
of
gratitude
when
the
first
natural
tears
were
dried
as
often
as
one
of
her
little
lambs
was
delivered
out
of
the
miseries
of
this
sinful
world
but
as
long
as
they
were
in
the
world
she
was
their
guardian
angel
and
there
was
hardly
a
mother
in
aberalva
who
did
not
confess
her
debt
to
grace
not
merely
for
her
children
scholarship
but
for
their
characters
frank
headley
the
curate
therefore
had
touched
altogether
the
wrong
chord
when
he
spoke
of
displacing
grace
and
when
that
same
afternoon
he
sauntered
down
to
the
wearied
with
his
parish
work
not
only
did
tardrew
stump
away
in
silence
as
soon
as
he
appeared
but
captain
willis
face
assumed
a
grave
and
severe
look
which
was
not
often
to
be
seen
on
it
well
captain
willis
said
frank
solitary
and
sad
longing
for
a
talk
with
someone
and
not
quite
sure
whether
he
was
welcome
well
sir
and
the
old
man
lifted
his
hat
and
made
one
of
his
princely
bows
you
look
tired
sir
i
am
afraid
you
doing
too
much
i
shall
have
more
to
do
soon
said
the
curate
his
eye
glancing
towards
the
schoolmistress
who
disturbed
by
the
noise
above
was
walking
slowly
up
the
beach
with
a
child
holding
to
every
finger
and
every
fold
of
her
dress
willis
saw
the
direction
of
his
eye
and
came
at
once
to
the
point
in
his
gentle
straightforward
fashion
i
hear
you
have
thoughts
of
taking
the
school
from
her
sir
why
indeed
i
shall
be
very
sorry
but
if
she
will
persist
in
going
to
the
chapel
i
can
not
overlook
the
sin
of
schism
she
takes
the
children
to
church
twice
a
sunday
do
she
and
teaches
them
all
that
you
tell
her
why
yes
i
have
taken
the
religious
instruction
almost
into
my
own
hands
now
willis
smiled
quietly
you
excuse
an
old
sailor
sir
but
i
think
that
more
than
mortal
man
can
do
there
no
hour
of
the
day
but
what
she
teaching
them
something
she
telling
them
bible
stories
now
i
warrant
if
you
could
hear
her
frank
made
no
answer
you
would
stop
her
doing
that
oh
sir
and
the
old
man
spoke
with
a
quiet
earnestness
which
was
not
without
its
effect
just
look
at
her
now
like
the
good
shepherd
with
his
lambs
about
his
feet
and
think
whether
that
not
much
too
pretty
a
sight
to
put
an
end
to
in
a
poor
sinful
world
like
this
it
is
my
duty
said
frank
hardening
himself
it
pains
me
exceedingly
willis
i
hope
i
need
not
tell
you
that
if
i
know
aught
of
headley
heart
by
his
ways
you
indeed
sir
but
i
can
not
allow
her
mother
a
class
leader
among
these
dissenters
and
one
of
the
most
active
of
them
the
school
next
door
to
her
house
the
preacher
of
course
has
influence
there
and
must
have
how
am
i
to
instil
church
principles
into
them
if
he
is
counteracting
me
the
moment
my
back
is
turned
i
have
made
up
my
mind
willis
to
do
nothing
in
a
hurry
is
past
and
she
must
go
on
till
midsummer
then
i
shall
take
the
school
into
my
own
hands
and
teach
them
myself
for
i
can
pay
no
mistress
or
master
and
just
frank
checked
himself
as
he
was
going
to
speak
the
truth
namely
that
his
sleepy
old
absentee
rector
lord
scoutbush
uncle
would
yawn
and
grumble
at
the
move
and
wondering
why
frank
had
not
the
sense
to
leave
ill
alone
would
give
him
no
manner
of
assistance
beyond
his
pittance
of
eighty
pounds
and
five
pounds
at
christmas
to
spend
on
the
poor
excuse
me
sir
i
do
doubt
that
you
do
your
best
in
teaching
as
you
always
do
but
i
tell
you
honestly
you
get
no
children
to
teach
no
children
their
mothers
know
the
worth
of
grace
too
well
and
the
children
too
sir
and
they
go
to
her
all
the
same
do
what
you
will
and
never
a
one
will
enter
the
church
door
from
that
day
forth
on
their
own
heads
be
it
said
frank
a
little
testily
but
i
should
not
have
fancied
miss
harvey
the
sort
of
person
to
set
up
herself
in
defiance
of
me
the
more
reason
sir
if
you
forgive
me
for
your
not
putting
upon
her
i
do
not
want
to
put
upon
her
or
any
one
i
will
do
everything
i
will
i
do
work
day
and
night
for
these
people
willis
i
tell
you
as
i
would
my
own
father
i
do
think
i
have
another
object
on
earth
if
i
have
i
hope
i
shall
forget
it
than
the
parish
but
church
principles
i
must
carry
out
well
sir
certainly
no
man
ever
worked
here
as
you
do
if
all
had
been
like
you
sir
there
would
not
be
a
dissenter
here
now
but
excuse
me
sir
the
church
is
a
very
good
thing
and
i
keep
to
mine
having
served
under
her
majesty
and
her
majesty
forefathers
and
learnt
to
obey
orders
i
hope
but
do
you
think
sir
you
taking
it
as
the
pharisees
took
the
how
then
why
as
if
man
was
made
for
the
church
and
not
the
church
for
man
that
is
a
shrewd
thought
at
least
where
did
you
pick
it
up
is
none
of
my
own
sir
a
bit
of
wisdom
that
my
maid
let
fall
and
it
has
stuck
to
me
strangely
ever
since
your
maid
yes
grace
there
i
always
call
her
my
maid
having
no
father
poor
thing
she
looks
up
to
me
as
one
pretty
much
the
dear
soul
oh
sir
i
hope
you
think
over
this
again
before
you
do
anything
done
in
a
day
but
years
wo
undo
it
again
so
grace
sayings
were
quoted
against
him
her
power
was
formidable
enough
if
she
dare
use
it
he
was
silent
awhile
and
then
do
you
think
she
has
heard
of
this
of
my
honesty
the
best
policy
sir
she
has
and
that
the
truth
you
know
how
things
get
round
well
and
what
did
she
say
i
tell
you
her
very
words
sir
and
they
were
these
if
excuse
me
dear
gentleman
says
she
he
thinks
so
wrong
why
does
he
dare
drive
folks
to
chapel
i
wonder
every
time
he
looks
at
that
deep
sea
he
do
remember
what
the
lord
said
about
it
and
those
who
cause
his
little
ones
to
offend
frank
was
somewhat
awed
the
thought
was
new
the
application
of
the
text
as
his
own
scholarship
taught
him
even
more
exact
than
grace
had
fancied
then
she
was
not
angry
she
sir
you
could
anger
her
if
you
tore
her
in
pieces
with
hot
pincers
as
they
did
those
old
martyrs
she
always
telling
about
willis
said
frank
in
a
hopeless
tone
of
voice
and
sauntered
to
the
down
the
steps
and
along
the
lower
burdened
with
many
thoughts
he
came
up
to
the
knot
of
chatting
sailors
not
one
of
them
touched
his
cap
or
moved
out
of
the
way
for
him
the
boat
lay
almost
across
the
whole
and
he
stopped
awkwardly
enough
for
there
was
not
room
to
get
by
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
let
me
pass
asked
he
meekly
enough
but
no
one
stirred
why
do
you
get
up
tom
asked
one
i
be
lame
so
be
i
the
gentleman
can
step
over
me
if
he
likes
said
big
jan
a
proposition
the
impossibility
whereof
raised
a
ai
you
ashamed
of
yourselves
lads
said
the
severe
voice
of
willis
from
above
the
men
rose
sulkily
and
frank
hastened
on
as
ready
to
cry
as
ever
he
had
been
in
his
life
poor
fellow
he
had
been
labouring
among
these
people
for
now
twelve
months
as
no
man
had
ever
laboured
before
and
he
felt
that
he
had
not
won
the
confidence
of
a
single
human
being
not
even
of
the
old
women
who
took
his
teaching
for
the
sake
of
his
charity
and
who
scented
popery
all
the
while
in
words
in
which
there
was
no
popery
and
in
doctrines
which
were
just
the
same
on
the
whole
as
those
of
the
dissenting
preacher
simply
because
he
would
sprinkle
among
them
certain
words
and
phrases
which
had
become
suspect
as
party
badges
his
church
was
all
but
empty
the
general
excuse
was
that
it
was
a
mile
from
the
town
but
frank
knew
that
that
was
not
the
true
reason
that
all
the
parish
had
got
it
into
their
heads
that
he
had
a
leaning
to
popery
that
he
was
going
over
to
rome
that
he
was
probably
a
jesuit
in
disguise
now
be
it
always
remembered
frank
headley
was
a
good
man
in
every
sense
of
the
word
he
had
nothing
save
the
outside
in
common
with
those
undesirable
coxcombs
who
have
not
been
bred
by
the
high
church
movement
but
have
taken
refuge
in
its
cracks
as
they
would
have
done
forty
years
ago
in
those
of
the
evangelical
youths
who
hide
their
crass
ignorance
and
dulness
under
the
cloak
of
church
infallibility
and
having
neither
wit
manners
learning
humanity
or
any
other
dignity
whereon
to
stand
talk
loud
pis
about
the
dignity
of
the
priesthood
such
men
frank
had
met
at
neighbouring
clerical
meetings
overbearing
and
the
elder
and
the
wiser
members
and
finding
that
he
got
no
good
from
them
had
withdrawn
into
his
to
eat
his
own
heart
like
bellerophon
of
old
for
frank
was
a
gentleman
and
a
christian
if
ever
one
there
was
delicate
in
person
all
but
consumptive
graceful
and
refined
in
all
his
works
and
ways
a
scholar
elegant
rather
than
deep
yet
a
scholar
still
full
of
all
love
for
painting
architecture
and
poetry
he
had
come
down
to
bury
himself
in
this
remote
curacy
in
the
honest
desire
of
doing
good
he
had
been
a
curate
in
a
fashionable
london
church
but
finding
the
atmosphere
thereof
not
over
wholesome
to
his
soul
he
had
had
the
courage
to
throw
off
nepomuc
its
brotherhoods
sisterhoods
and
all
its
gorgeous
and
appliances
for
enabling
five
thousand
rich
to
take
tolerable
care
of
five
hundred
poor
and
had
fled
from
the
holy
virgins
as
certain
old
ladies
who
do
twice
their
work
with
half
their
noise
call
them
into
the
wilderness
of
bethnal
green
but
six
months
gallant
work
there
with
gallant
men
for
there
are
high
churchmen
there
who
are
an
honour
to
england
brought
him
to
death
door
the
doctors
commanded
some
soft
western
air
frank
as
chivalrous
as
a
of
old
would
fain
have
died
at
his
post
but
his
mother
interfered
and
he
could
do
no
less
than
obey
her
so
he
had
taken
this
remote
west
country
curacy
all
the
more
willingly
because
he
knew
that
of
the
people
were
dissenters
to
recover
that
place
to
the
church
would
be
something
worth
living
for
so
he
had
come
and
laboured
late
and
early
and
behold
he
had
failed
utterly
and
seemed
farther
than
ever
from
success
he
had
opened
too
hastily
a
crusade
against
the
dissenters
and
denounced
where
he
should
have
conciliated
he
had
overlooked
indeed
he
hardly
knew
the
sad
truth
that
the
mere
fact
of
his
being
a
clergyman
was
no
passport
to
the
hearts
of
his
people
for
the
curate
who
preceded
him
had
been
an
old
man
mean
ignorant
incapable
remaining
there
simply
because
nobody
else
would
have
him
and
given
to
as
much
as
his
flock
the
rector
for
the
last
fifteen
years
lord
scoutbush
uncle
was
a
cypher
the
rector
before
him
had
notoriously
earned
the
living
by
a
marriage
with
a
lady
who
stood
in
some
questionable
relation
to
lord
scoutbush
father
and
who
had
never
had
a
thought
above
his
dinner
and
his
tithes
and
all
that
the
aberalva
fishermen
knew
of
god
or
righteousness
they
had
learnt
from
the
disciples
of
john
wesley
so
frank
headley
had
to
make
up
at
starting
the
arrears
of
of
base
neglect
but
instead
of
doing
so
he
had
contrived
to
awaken
against
himself
that
dogged
hatred
of
popery
which
lies
inarticulate
and
confused
but
deep
and
firm
in
the
heart
of
the
english
people
poor
fellow
if
he
made
a
mistake
he
suffered
for
it
there
was
hardly
a
sadder
soul
than
poor
frank
as
he
went
listlessly
up
the
village
street
that
afternoon
to
his
lodging
at
captain
willis
which
he
had
taken
because
he
preferred
living
in
the
village
itself
to
occupying
the
comfortable
rectory
a
mile
out
of
town
however
we
can
not
set
him
straight
after
all
every
man
must
perform
that
office
for
himself
so
the
best
thing
we
can
do
as
we
landed
naturally
at
the
is
to
walk
after
him
and
see
what
sort
of
a
place
aberalva
is
beneath
us
to
the
left
hand
is
the
now
lying
dry
in
which
a
dozen
trawlers
are
lopping
over
on
their
sides
their
red
sails
drying
in
the
sun
the
tails
of
the
trawls
hauled
up
to
the
topmast
heads
while
the
more
handy
of
their
owners
are
getting
on
board
by
ladders
to
pack
away
the
said
red
sails
for
it
will
blow
to
night
in
the
long
furrows
which
their
keels
have
left
and
in
the
shallow
muddy
pools
lie
innumerable
fragments
of
exenterated
maids
not
human
ones
pitiful
reader
but
belonging
to
the
order
pisces
and
the
family
raia
and
some
twenty
and
picked
dogs
anglice
together
with
a
fine
basking
shark
at
least
nine
feet
long
out
of
which
the
kneeling
george

clothed
in
pilot
cloth
patches
of
every
hue
bright
scarlet
blue

not
to

thereof
the

bedded
with
black
mud
and
creamed
over
with
oily
flakes
which

proceed
from

from

spot
where
the

of

small
enough
considering
the
place
holds
fifteen
hundred
souls
murmurs
from
beneath
a
grey
stone
arch
toward
the
sea
not
unfraught
with
dead
rats
and
cats
who
their
ancient
feud
forgotten
combine
lovingly
at
last
in
increasing
the
health
of
the
urchins
who
are
sailing
upon
that
acherontic
stream
bits
of
board
with
a
feather
stuck
in
it
or
of
their
tiny
sisters
who
are
dancing
about
in
the
dirtiest
pool
among
the
trawlers
in
a
way
which
if
your
respectable
black
coat
be
seen
upon
the
pier
will
elicit
from
one
of
the
balconied
windows
above
decked
with
reeking
shirts
and
linen
some
such
shriek
as
patience
penberthy
patience
penberthy

nasty
dirty
little

hussy
a

be
playing
in

for

up
your

before
the
quality
a

exclamation
being
followed
with
that
groaning
grunt
with
which
the
folk
after
having
screamed
their
lungs
empty
through
their
noses
recover
their
breath
for
a
fresh
burst
never
mind
it
is
no
nosegay
certainly
as
a
whole
but
did
you
ever
see
sturdier
rosier
children
rounder
faces
raven
hair
bright
grey
eyes
full
of
fun
and
tenderness
as
for
the
dirt
that
can
not
harm
them
poor
people
children
must
be
dirty
why
not
look
on
fifty
yards
to
the
left
between
two
ridges
of
high
pebble
bank
some
twenty
yards
apart
comes
alva
river
rushing
to
the
sea
on
the
opposite
ridge
a
low
white
house
with
three
or
four
white
boats
and
a
with
sloping

beyond
it
rise
black
jagged
cliffs

after
mile
of

here
and
there
at
the
mouths
great
banks
and
denes
of
shifting
sand
in
front
of
it
upon
the
beach
are
great
green
and
grey
heaps
of
welsh
limestone
behind
it
at
the
cliff
foot
is
the
with
its
white
dusty
heaps
and
brown
dusty
men
its
quivering
mirage
of
hot
air
its
strings
of
patient
donkeys
which
look
as
if
they
had
just
awakened
out
of
a
flour
bin
above
a
green
down
stretches
up
to
bright
yellow

aloft
behind
a

marsh
covered
with

the

it
closes
in
the
steep
sides
of
the
hills
are
clothed
in
oak
and
ash
covert
in
which
three
months
ago
you
could
have
shot
more
cocks
in
one
day
than
you
would
in
berkshire
in
a
year
pleasant
little
glimpses
there
are
too
of
grey
stone
nestling
among
sycamore
and
beech
meadows
squares
of
rich
red
parted
by
lines
of
golden
furze
all
cut
out
with
a
peculiar
blackness
and
clearness
soft
and
tender
withal
which
betokens
a
climate
surcharged
with
rain
only
in
the
very
bosom
of
the
valley
a
soft
mist
hangs
increasing
the
sense
of
distance
and
softening
back
one
hill
and
wood
behind
another
till
the
great
brown
moor
which
backs
it
all
seems
to
rise
out
of
the
empty
air
for
a
thousand
feet
it
ranges
up
in
rude
sheets
of
brown
heather
and
grey
cairns
and
screes
of
granite
all
sharp
and
against
the
pale
blue
sky
and
all
suddenly
cut
off
above
by
one
long
horizontal
line
of
dark
grey
cloud
which
seems
to
hang
there
motionless
and
yet
is
growing
to
windward
and
dying
to
leeward
for
ever
rushing
out
of
the
invisible
into
sight
and
into
the
invisible
again
at
railroad
speed
out
of
nothing
the
moor
rises
and
into
nothing
it
ascends
a
great
dark
phantom
between
earth
and
sky
boding
rain
and
howling
tempest
and
perhaps
fearful
wreck
for
the
groundswell
moans
and
thunders
on
the
beach
behind
us
louder
and
louder
every
moment
let
us
go
on
and
up
the
street
after
we
have
scrambled
through
the
usual
labyrinth
of
rusty
anchors
boats
which
have
been
dragged
for
the
purpose
of
mending
and
tarring
into
the
very
middle
of
the
road
and
old
spars
stowed
under
walls
in
the
vain
hope
that
they
may
be
of
some
use
for
something
some
day
and
have
stood
the
stares
and
welcomes
of
the
lazy
giants
who
are
sitting
about
upon
them
with
ruddy
wholesome
faces
and
eyes
as
bright
as
diamonds
men
who
are
on
their
own
ground
and
know
it
who
will
not
touch
their
caps
to
you
or
pull
the
short
black
pipe
from
between
their
lips
as
you
pass
but
expect
you
to
prove
yourself
a
gentleman
by
speaking
respectfully
to
them
which
if
you
do
you
will
find
them
as
hearty
intelligent
brave
fellows
as
ever
walked
this
earth
capable
of
anything
from
working
the
guns
at
sevastopol
down
to
running
up
to
a
hundred
miles
in
a
cockleshell
lugger
to
forestall
the
early
mackerel
market
god
be
with
you
my
brave
lads
and
with
your
children
after
you
for
as
long
as
you
are
what
i
have
known
you
old
england
will
rule
the
seas
and
many
a
land
beside
but
in
going
up
aberalva
street
you
remark
several
things
first
that
the
houses
were
all
yesterday
except
where
the
snowy
white
is
picked
out
by
buttresses
of
pink
and
blue
next
that
they
all
have
bright
green
palings
in
front
and
bright
green
and
frames
next
that
they
are
all
roofed
with
shining
grey
slate
and
the
space
between
the
window
and
the
pales
flagged
with
the
same
next
that
where
such
space
is
not
flagged
it
is
full
of
flowers
and
shrubs
which
stand
the
winter
only
in
our
greenhouses
the
fuchsias
are
ten
feet
high
laden
with
ripe
purple
berries
running
over
for
there
are
no
birds
to
pick
them
off
and
there
in
the
front
of
the
lieutenant
house
is
cobaea
scandens
covered
with
purple
as
it
has
been
ever
since
christmas
for
aberalva
knows
no
winter
and
there
are
men
in
it
who
never
put
on
a
skate
or
made
a
snowball
in
their
lives
a
most
cleanly
street
is
that
long
straggling
one
which
runs
up
the
hill
towards
penalva
court
only
remark
that
this
cleanliness
is
gained
by
making
the
gutter
in
the
middle
street
the
common
sewer
of
the
town
and
tread
clear
of
pilchard
bones
id
genus
for
aberalva
is
like
paris
if
the
answer
of
a
celebrated
sanitary
reformer
to
the
emperor
be
truly
reported
fair
without
but
foul
within
however
the
wind
is
blowing
dull
and
hollow
from
the
clouds
are
rolling
faster
and
faster
up
from
the
atlantic
the
sky
to
westward
is
brassy
green
the
glass
is
falling
fast
and
there
will
be
wind
and
rain
enough
to
sweep
even
aberalva
clean
for
the
next
week
grace
harvey
sees
the
coming
storm
as
she
goes
slowly
homewards
dismissing
her
little
flock
and
she
lingers
long
and
sadly
outside
her
cottage
door
looking
out
over
the
fast
blackening
sea
and
listening
to
the
hollow
thunder
of
the
groundswell
against
the
back
of
the
point
which
shelters
aberalva
cove
far
away
on
the
horizon
the
masts
of
stately
ships
stand
out
against
the
sky
driving
fast
to
the
eastward
with
shortened
sail
they
too
know
what
is
coming
and
grace
prays
for
them
as
she
stands
in
her
wild
way
with
half
outspoken
words
all
those
gallant
ships
dear
lord
and
so
many
beautiful
men
in
them
and
so
few
of
them
ready
to
die
and
all
those
gallant
soldiers
going
to
the
war
lord
wilt
thou
not
have
mercy
spare
them
for
a
little
time
before
is
not
that
cruel
sea
full
enough
lord
and
brave
men
bones
enough
strewn
up
and
down
all
rocks
and
sands
and
is
not
that
dark
place
full
enough
o
lord
of
poor
souls
cut
off
in
a
moment
as
my
two
were
oh
not
dear
lord
do
not
call
any
one
give
them
a
day
more
one
chance
more
poor
fellows
they
have
had
so
few
and
so
many
temptations
and
perhaps
no
schooling
they
go
to
sea
so
early
and
young
things
will
be
young
things
lord
spare
them
but
one
night
more
and
yet
he
did
not
spare
my
two
they
had
no
time
to
repent
and
have
no
time
for
ever
evermore
and
she
stands
looking
out
over
the
sea
but
she
has
lost
sight
of
everything
save
her
own
sad
imaginations
her
eyes
open
wider
and
wider
as
if
before
some
unseen
horror
the
eyebrows
contract
upwards
the
cheeks
sharpen
the
mouth
parts
the
lips
draw
back
showing
the
white
teeth
as
if
in
intensest
agony
thus
she
stands
long
motionless
save
when
a
shudder
runs
through
every
limb
with
such
a
countenance
as
that
fair
terror
of
which
shelley
sang
its
horror
and
its
beauty
are
divine
upon
its
lips
and
eyelids
seem
to
lie
loveliness
like
a
shadow
from
which
shine
fiery
and
lucid
struggling
underneath
the
agonies
of
anguish
and
of
death
her
mother
comes
out
from
the
cottage
door
behind
and
lays
her
hand
upon
the
girl
shoulder
the
spell
is
broken
and
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
grace
bursts
into
violent
weeping
what
are
you
doing
my
poor
child
here
in
the
cold
night
air
my
two
mother
my
two
said
she
and
all
the
poor
souls
at
sea
you
must
think
of
it
have
i
told
you
not
to
think
of
it
one
would
lose
one
wits
if
one
did
too
often
if
it
is
all
true
mother
what
else
is
there
worth
thinking
of
in
heaven
or
earth
and
grace
goes
in
with
a
dull
heavy
look
of
utter
exhaustion
bodily
and
mental
and
quietly
sets
the
things
for
supper
and
goes
about
her
cottage
work
as
one
who
bears
a
heavy
chain
but
has
borne
it
too
long
to
let
it
hinder
the
daily
drudgery
of
life
grace
had
reason
to
pray
at
least
for
the
soldiers
who
were
going
to
the
war
for
as
she
prayed
the
orinoco
ripon
and
manilla
were
steaming
down
southampton
water
with
the
guards
on
board
and
but
that
morning
little
lord
scoutbush
left
behind
at
the
depôt
had
bid
farewell
to
his
best
friend
opposite
buckingham
palace
while
the
bearskins
were
on
the
with
well
old
fellow
you
have
the
fun
after
all
and
i
the
work
and
had
been
answered
with
fun
there
will
be
no
fighting
and
i
shall
only
have
lost
my
season
in
town
was
there
then
no
man
among
them
that
day
who
as
the
trees
began
to
whisper
and
the
wind
began
to
roll
heard
in
the
wild
march
morning

chapter

anything
but
still
life
penalva
court
about
half
a
mile
from
the
quay
is
like
a
house
in
a
story
a
house
of
seven
gables
and
those
very
shaky
ones
a
house
of
useless
long
passages
useless
turrets
vast
lumber
attics
where
maids
see
ghosts
lofty
garden
and
yard
walls
of
grey
stone
round
which
the
wind
and
rain
are
lashing
through
the
dreary
darkness
low
ceilings
windows
which
once
were
mullioned
with
stone
but
now
with
wood
painted
white
walls
which
were
once
but
have
been
painted
like
the
mullions
to
the
disgust
of
elsley
vavasour
poet
its
occupant
in
march
who
forgot
that
while
the
oak
was
left
dark
no
man
could
have
seen
to
read
in
the
rooms
a
yard
from
the
window
he
has
however
little
reason
to
complain
of
the
one
where
he
and
his
wife
are
sitting
so
pleasant
has
she
made
it
look
in
spite
of
the
plainness
of
the
furniture
a
bright
is
burning
on
the
hearth
there
are
a
few
good
books
too
and
a
few
handsome
prints
while
some
really
valuable
are
set
out
with
pardonable
ostentation
on
a
little
table
covered
with
crimson
velvet
it
is
only
cotton
velvet
if
you
look
close
at
it
but
the
things
are
pretty
enough
to
catch
the
eye
of
all
visitors
and
heale
the
doctor
wife
who
always
calls
vavasour
my
lady
though
she
does
not
love
her
and
trebooze
of
trebooze
always
finger
them
over
when
they
have
any
opportunity
and
whisper
to
each
other
half
contemptuously
ah
poor
thing
there
a
sign
that
she
has
seen
better
days
and
better
days
in
one
sense
vavasour
has
seen
i
am
afraid
indeed
that
she
has
more
than
once
regretted
the
morning
when
she
ran
away
in
a
from
her
brother
lord
scoutbush
house
in
eaton
square
to
be
married
to
elsley
vavasour
the
gifted
author
of
a
soul
agonies
and
other
poems
he
was
a
lion
then
with
foolish
women
running
after
him
and
turning
his
head
once
and
for
all
and
lucia
just
was
a
wild
irish
girl
new
to
london
society
all
feeling
and
romance
and
literally
all
for
there
was
little
real
intellect
underlying
her
passionate
sensibility
so
when
the
sensibility
burnt
itself
out
as
it
generally
does
and
when
children
and
the
weak
health
which
comes
with
them
and
the
cares
of
a
household
and
money
difficulties
were
absorbing
her
little
powers
elsley
vavasour
began
to
fancy
that
his
wife
was
a
very
commonplace
person
who
was
fast
losing
even
her
good
looks
and
her
good
temper
so
on
the
whole
they
were
not
happy
elsley
was
an
affectionate
man
and
honourable
to
a
fantastic
nicety
but
he
was
vain
capricious
craving
for
admiration
and
distinction
and
it
was
not
enough
for
him
that
his
wife
loved
him
and
bore
him
children
kept
his
accounts
mended
and
moiled
all
day
long
for
him
and
his
he
wanted
her
to
act
the
public
for
him
exactly
when
he
was
hungry
for
praise
and
that
not
the
actual
but
an
altogether
ideal
public
to
worship
him
as
a
deity
live
for
him
and
him
alone
realise
his
poetic
dreams
of
marriage
bliss
and
talk
sentiment
with
him
or
listen
to
him
talking
sentiment
to
her
when
she
would
much
sooner
be
safe
in
bed
burying
all
the
petty
cares
of
the
day
and
the
pain
in
her
back
too
poor
thing
in
sound
sleep
and
so
it
befell
that
they
often
quarrelled
and
wrangled
and
that
they
were
quarrelling
and
wrangling
this
very
night
who
cares
to
know
how
it
began
who
cares
to
hear
how
it
went
on
the
stupid
aimless
skirmish
of
bitter
words
between
two
people
who
had
forgotten
themselves
i
believe
it
began
with
elsley
being
vexed
at
her
springing
up
two
or
three
times
fancying
that
she
heard
the
children
cry
while
he
wanted
to
be
quiet
and
sentimentalise
over
the
roaring
of
the
wind
outside
then
she
thought
of
nothing
but
those
children
why
did
she
not
take
a
book
and
occupy
her
mind
to
which
she
had
her
pert
though
just
answer
about
her
mind
having
quite
enough
to
do
to
keep
clothes
on
the
children
backs
and
so
forth
let
who
list
imagine
the
miserable
little
squabble
till
she
says
i
know
what
has
put
you
out
so
nothing
but
the
news
of
my
sister
coming
he
answers
that
her
sister
is
as
little
to
him
as
to
any
man
as
welcome
to
come
now
as
she
has
been
to
stay
away
these
three
years
ah
it
very
well
to
say
that
but
you
have
been
a
different
person
ever
since
that
letter
came
and
so
she
torments
him
into
an
angry
which
she
takes
triumphantly
as
a
confession
that
it
is
very
disagreeable
to
have
his
thoughts
broken
in
on
by
one
who
has
no
sympathy
with
him
and
his
pursuits
and
who
and
at
that
point
he
wisely
stops
short
for
he
was
going
to
throw
down
a
very
ugly
gage
of
battle
thrown
down
or
not
lucia
snatches
at
it
ah
i
understand
poor
valentia
you
always
hated
her
i
did
not
but
she
is
so
brusque
and
excited
and
be
so
kind
as
not
to
abuse
my
family
you
may
say
what
you
will
of
me
but
and
what
have
your
family
done
for
me
pray
why
considering
that
we
are
now
living
in
my
house
and
she
stops
in
her
turn
for
her
pride
and
her
prudence
also
will
not
let
her
tell
him
that
valentia
has
been
clothing
her
and
the
children
for
the
last
three
years
he
is
just
the
man
to
forbid
her
on
the
spot
to
receive
any
more
presents
and
to
sacrifice
her
comfort
to
his
own
pride
but
what
she
has
said
is
quite
enough
to
bring
out
a
very
angry
answer
which
she
expecting
nips
in
the
bud
by
for
goodness
sake
do
speak
so
loud
i
do
want
the
servants
to
hear
i
am
not
speaking
loud
he
has
not
yet
opened
his
lips
that
is
your
old
trick
to
prevent
my
defending
myself
while
you
are
driving
one
mad
how
dare
you
taunt
me
with
being
a
pensioner
on
your
brother
bounty
i
go
up
to
town
again
and
take
lodgings
there
i
need
not
be
beholden
to
any
aristocrat
of
them
all
i
have
my
own
station
in
the
real
world
the
world
of
intellect
i
have
my
own
friends
i
have
made
myself
a
name
without
his
help
and
i
can
live
without
his
help
he
shall
find
which
name
were
you
speaking
of
rejoins
she
looking
up
at
him
with
all
her
native
irish
humour
flashing
up
for
a
moment
in
her
naughty
eyes
the
next
minute
she
would
have
given
her
hand
not
to
have
said
it
for
with
a
very
terrible
word
elsley
springs
to
his
feet
and
dashes
out
of
the
room
she
hears
him
catch
up
his
hat
and
cloak
and
hurry
out
into
the
rain
slamming
the
door
behind
him
she
springs
up
to
call
him
back
but
he
is
gone
and
she
dashes
herself
on
the
floor
and
bursts
into
an
agony
of
weeping
over
young
bliss
never
to
return
not
in
the
least
her
principal
fear
is
lest
he
should
catch
cold
in
the
rain
she
takes
up
her
work
again
and
stitches
away
in
the
comfortable
certainty
that
in
half
an
hour
she
will
have
recovered
her
temper
and
he
also
that
they
will
pass
a
sulky
night
and
by
about
without
explanation
or
formal
reconciliation
have
become
as
good
friends
as
ever
perhaps
says
she
to
herself
with
a
sense
of
power
if
he
be
very
much
ashamed
and
very
wet
i
pity
him
and
make
friends
miserable
enough
are
these
little
squabbles
why
will
two
people
who
have
sworn
to
love
and
cherish
each
other
utterly
and
who
on
the
whole
do
what
they
have
sworn
behave
to
each
other
as
they
dare
for
very
shame
behave
to
no
one
else
is
it
that
as
every
beautiful
thing
has
its
hideous
antitype
this
mutual
shamelessness
is
the
ape
of
mutual
confidence
perhaps
it
can
not
be
otherwise
with
beings
compact
of
good
and
evil
when
the
veil
of
reserve
is
withdrawn
from
between
two
souls
it
must
be
withdrawn
for
evil
as
for
good
till
the
two
natures
which
ought
to
seek
rest
each
in
the
other
inmost
depths
may
at
last
spring
apart
confronting
each
other
recklessly
with
there
you
see
me
as
i
am
you
know
the
worst
of
me
and
i
of
you
take
me
as
you
find
me
what
care
i
elsley
and
lucia
have
not
yet
arrived
at
that
terrible
crisis
though
they
are
on
the
path
toward
it
the
path
of
little
carelessnesses
rudenesses
ungoverned
words
and
tempers
and
worst
of
all
of
that
which
is
certain
to
avenge
itself
by
irritation
and
quarrelling
for
if
two
married
people
will
not
tell
each
other
in
love
what
they
ought
they
will
be
sure
to
tell
each
other
in
anger
what
they
ought
not
it
is
plain
enough
already
that
elsley
has
his
weak
point
which
must
not
be
touched
something
about
a
name
which
lucia
is
to
be
expected
to
ignore
as
if
anything
which
really
exists
could
be
ignored
while
two
people
live
together
night
and
day
for
better
for
worse
till
the
thorn
is
out
the
wound
will
not
heal
and
till
the
matter
whatever
it
may
be
is
set
right
by
confession
and
absolution
there
will
be
no
peace
for
them
for
they
are
living
in
a
lie
and
unless
it
be
a
very
little
one
indeed
better
perhaps
that
they
should
go
on
to
that
terrible
crisis
of
open
defiance
it
may
end
in
disgust
hatred
madness
but
it
may
too
end
in
each
falling
again
upon
the
other
bosom
and
sobbing
out
through
holy
tears
yes
you
do
know
the
worst
of
me
and
yet
you
love
me
still
this
is
happiness
to
find
oneself
most
loved
when
one
most
hates
oneself
god
help
us
to
confess
our
sins
to
thee
as
we
have
done
to
each
other
and
to
begin
life
again
like
little
children
struggling
hand
in
hand
out
of
this
lowest
pit
up
the
steep
path
which
leads
to
life
and
strength
and
peace
heaven
grant
that
it
may
so
end
but
now
elsley
has
gone
raging
out
into
the
raging
darkness
trying
to
prove
himself
to
himself
the
most
injured
of
men
and
to
hate
his
wife
as
much
as
possible
though
the
fool
knows
the
whole
time
that
he
loves
her
better
than
anything
on
earth
even
than
that
fame
on
which
he
tries
to
fatten
his
lean
soul
snapping
greedily
at
every
scrap
which
falls
in
his
way
and
in
default
snapping
at
everybody
and
everything
else
and
little
comfort
it
gives
him
why
should
it
what
comfort
save
in
being
wise
and
strong
and
is
he
the
wiser
or
stronger
for
being
told
by
a
reviewer
that
he
has
written
fine
words
or
has
failed
in
writing
them
or
to
have
silly
women
writing
to
ask
for
his
autograph
or
for
leave
to
set
his
songs
to
music
nay
shocking
as
the
question
may
seem
is
he
the
wiser
and
stronger
man
for
being
a
poet
at
all
and
a
genius
provided
of
course
that
the
word
genius
is
used
in
its
modern
meaning
of
a
person
who
can
say
prettier
things
than
his
neighbours
i
think
not
be
it
as
it
may
away
goes
the
poor
genius
his
long
cloak
picturesque
enough
in
calm
weather
fluttering
about
uncomfortably
enough
while
the
rain
washes
his
long
curls
into
swabs
out
through
the
old
garden
between
laurels
beneath
dark
groaning
pines
and
through
a
door
in
the
wall
which
opens
into
the
lane
the
lane
leads
downward
on
the
right
into
the
village
he
is
in
no
temper
to
meet
his
even
to
see
the
comfortable
gleam
through
their
windows
as
the
sailors
close
round
the
fire
with
wife
and
child
so
he
turns
to
the
left
up
the
deep
lane
which
leads
towards
the
cliff
dark
now
as
pitch
for
it
is
overhung
right
and
left
with
deep
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
proceed
though
for
the
wind
pours
down
the
lane
as
through
a
funnel
and
the
road
is
of
slippery
bare
slate
worn
here
and
there
into
puddles
of
greasy
clay
and
elsley
slips
back
half
of
every
step
while
his
wrath
as
he
tires
oozes
out
of
his
heels
moreover
those
dark
trees
above
him
tossing
their
heads
impatiently
against
the
scarcely
less
dark
sky
strike
an
awe
into
him
a
sense
of
loneliness
almost
of
fear
an
uncanny
bad
night
it
is
and
he
is
out
on
a
bad
errand
and
he
knows
it
and
wishes
that
he
were
home
again
he
does
not
believe
of
course
in
those
spirits
of
the
storm
about
whom
he
has
so
often
written
any
more
than
he
does
in
a
great
deal
of
his
fine
imagery
but
still
in
such
characters
as
his
the
sympathy
between
the
moods
of
nature
and
those
of
the
mind
is
most
real
and
important
and
dame
nature
equinoctial
night
wrath
is
weird
gruesome
crushing
and
can
be
faced
if
it
must
be
faced
in
real
comfort
only
when
one
is
going
on
an
errand
of
mercy
with
a
clear
conscience
a
light
heart
a
good
cigar
and
plenty
of
mackintosh
so
ere
elsley
had
gone
a
quarter
of
a
mile
he
turned
back
and
resolved
to
go
in
and
take
up
his
book
once
more
perhaps
lucia
might
beg
his
pardon
and
if
not
why
perhaps
he
might
beg
hers
the
rain
was
washing
the
spirit
out
of
him
as
it
does
out
of
a
horse
stay
what
was
that
sound
above
the
roar
of
the
gale
a
cannon
he
listened
turning
his
head
right
and
left
to
escape
the
howling
of
the
wind
in
his
ears
a
minute
and
another
boom
rose
and
rang
aloft
it
was
near
too
he
almost
fancied
that
he
felt
the
concussion
of
the
air
another
and
another
and
then
in
the
village
below
he
could
see
lights
hurrying
to
and
fro
a
wreck
at
sea
he
turned
again
up
the
lane
he
had
never
seen
a
wreck
what
an
opportunity
for
a
poet
and
on
such
a
night
too
it
would
be
magnificent
if
the
moon
would
but
come
out
just
the
scene
too
for
his
excited
temper
he
will
work
on
upward
let
it
blow
and
rain
as
it
may
he
is
not
disappointed
ere
he
has
gone
a
hundred
yards
a
mass
of
dripping
runs
full
butt
against
him
knocking
him
against
the
bank
and
by
the
clank
of
weapons
he
recognises
the
watchman
hillo
who
that
beg
your
pardon
sir
as
the
man
recognises
elsley
voice
what
is
it
what
are
the
guns
god
knows
sir
overright
the
chough
and
crow
on
i
afeard
there
they
go
again
hard
up
poor
souls
god
help
them
and
the
man
runs
shouting
down
the
lane
another
gun
and
another
but
long
ere
elsley
reaches
the
cliff
they
are
silent
and
nothing
is
to
be
heard
but
the
noise
of
the
storm
which
loud
as
it
was
below
among
the
wood
is
almost
intolerable
now
that
he
is
on
the
open
down
he
struggles
up
the
lane
toward
the
cliff
and
there
pauses
gasping
under
the
shelter
of
a
wall
trying
to
analyse
that
enormous
mass
of
sound
which
fills
his
ears
and
brain
and
flows
through
his
heart
like
maddening
wine
he
can
bear
the
sight
of
the
dead
grass
on
the
weary
feeble
expostulating
with
its
old
tormentor
the
gale
then
the
fierce
screams
of
the
blasts
as
they
rush
up
across
the
layers
of
rock
below
like
hounds
leaping
up
at
their
prey
and
far
beneath
the
horrible
confused
of
that
great
leaguer
of
waves
he
can
not
see
them
as
he
strains
his
eyes
over
the
wall
into
the
blank
depth
nothing
but
a
confused
welter
and
quiver
of
mingled
air
and
rain
and
spray
as
if
the
very
atmosphere
were
writhing
in
the
clutches
of
the
gale
but
he
can
hear
what
can
he
not
hear
it
would
have
needed
a
less
vivid
brain
than
elsley
to
fancy
another
badajos
beneath
there
it
all
is
the
rush
of
columns
to
the
breach
officers
cheering
them
on
pauses
breaks
wild
retreats
upbraiding
calls
whispering
consultations
fresh
rush
on
rush
now
here
now
there
fierce
shouts
above
below
behind
shrieks
of
agony
choked
groans
and
gasps
of
dying
men
hurled
down
with
all
their
rattling
freight
dull
ringing
as
the
old
fortress
blasts
back
its
besiegers
into
the
deep
it
is
all
there
truly
enough
there
at
least
to
madden
yet
more
elsley
wild
angry
brain
till
he
tries
to
add
his
shouts
to
the
great
of
land
and
sea
and
finds
them
as
little
audible
as
an
infant
wail
suddenly
far
below
him
a
bright
glimmer
and
in
a
moment
a
reveals
the
whole
scene
in
ghastly
hues
blue
leaping
breakers
blue
weltering
sheets
of
foam
blue
rocks
crowded
with
blue
figures
like
ghosts
flitting
to
and
fro
upon
the
brink
of
that
blue
seething
phlegethon
and
rushing
up
towards
him
through
the
air
a
thousand
flying
blue
which
dive
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
vanish
like
delicate
fairies
fleeing
before
the
wrath
of
the
gale
but
where
is
the
wreck
the
can
not
pierce
the
grey
veil
of
mingled
mist
and
spray
which
hangs
to
seaward
and
her
guns
have
been
silent
for
half
an
hour
and
more
elsley
hurries
down
and
finds
half
the
village
collected
on
the
long
sloping
point
of
down
below
sailors
wrapped
in
women
with
their
gowns
turned
over
their
heads
staggering
restlessly
up
and
down
and
in
and
out
while
every
moment
some
fresh
comer
stumbles
down
the
slope
thrusting
himself
into
his
clothes
as
he
goes
and
asks
where
the
wreck
and
gets
no
answer
but
a
surly
advice
to
hold
his
noise
as
if
they
had
hope
of
hearing
the
wreck
which
they
can
not
see
and
kind
women
with
their
hearts
full
of
mothers
instincts
declare
that
they
can
hear
little
children
crying
and
are
down
by
kind
men
who
fashion
do
like
to
believe
anything
too
painful
or
if
they
believe
it
to
talk
of
it
what
were
the
guns
from
then
brown
asks
the
lieutenant
of
the
off
the
chough
and
crow
i
thought
sir
god
grant
not
you
thought
sir
says
the
great
man
willing
to
vent
his
vexation
on
some
one
did
you
make
sure
why
just
look
lieutenant
says
brown
pointing
into
the
blank
height
of
the
dark
and
i
was
on
the
pier
too
and
could
see
but
the
man
here
says
a
shift
of
wind
a
drift
of
cloud
and
the
moon
flashes
out
a
there
she
is
sir
some
three
hundred
yards
out
at
sea
lies
a
long
curved
black
line
beautiful
severe
and
still
amid
those
white
wild
leaping
hills
a
murmur
from
the
crowd
which
swells
into
a
roar
as
they
surge
aimlessly
up
and
down
another
moment
and
it
is
cut
in
two
by
a
white
line
covered
lost
all
hold
their
breaths
no
the
sea
passes
on
and
still
the
black
curve
is
there
enduring
a
terrible
big
ship
a
liverpool
clipper
by
the
lines
of
her
god
help
the
poor
passengers
then
sobs
a
woman
they
past
our
help
she
on
her
beam
ends
and
her
deck
upright
toward
us
silence
out
of
the
way
you
loafing
shouts
the
lieutenant
brown
the
rockets
what
though
the
lieutenant
be
somewhat
given
to
strong
liquors
and
stronger
language
he
wears
the
queen
uniform
and
what
is
more
he
knows
his
work
and
can
do
it
all
make
a
silent
ring
while
the
fork
is
planted
the
lieutenant
throwing
away
the
end
of
his
cigar
kneels
and
adjusts
the
stick
brown
and
his
mates
examine
and
shake
out
the
coils
of
line
another
minute
and
the
magnificent
creature
rushes
forth
with
a
triumphant
roar
and
soars
aloft
over
the
waves
in
a
long
stream
of
fire
defiant
of
the
gale
is
it
over
her
no
a
fierce
gust
which
all
but
hurls
the
spectators
to
the
ground
the
fiery
stream
sweeps
away
to
the
left
in
a
grand
curve
of
sparks
and
drops
into
the
sea
try
it
again
shouts
the
lieutenant
his
blood
now
up
we
see
which
will
beat
wind
or
powder
again
a
rocket
is
fixed
with
more
allowance
for
the
wind
but
the
black
curve
has
disappeared
and
he
must
wait
awhile
there
it
is
again
fly
swift
and
sure
cries
elsley
thou
fiery
angel
of
mercy
bearing
the
it
may
not
be
too
late
yet
full
and
true
the
rocket
went
across
her
and
three
cheers
for
the
lieutenant
rose
above
the
storm
silence
lads
not
so
bad
though
says
he
rubbing
his
wet
hands
hold
on
by
the
line
and
watch
for
a
bite
brown
five
minutes
pass
brown
has
the
line
in
his
hand
waiting
for
any
signal
touch
from
the
ship
but
the
line
sways
limp
in
the
surge
ten
minutes
the
lieutenant
lights
a
fresh
cigar
and
paces
up
and
down
smoking
fiercely
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
yet
no
response
the
moon
is
shining
clearly
now
they
can
see
her
hatchways
the
stumps
of
her
masts
great
tangles
of
rigging
swaying
and
lashing
down
across
her
deck
but
that
delicate
upper
curve
is
becoming
more
ragged
after
every
wave
and
the
tide
is
rising
fast
there
a
pull
shouts
brown
no
there
ai
god
have
mercy
sir
she
going
the
black
curve
boils
up
as
if
a
mine
had
been
sprung
on
board
leaps
into
arches
jagged
peaks
black
bars
crossed
and
tangled
and
then
all
melts
away
into
the
white
seething
waste
while
the
line
floats
home
helplessly
as
if
disappointed
and
the
billows
plunge
more
sullenly
and
sadly
towards
the
shore
as
if
in
remorse
for
their
dark
and
reckless
deed
all
is
over
what
shall
we
do
now
go
home
and
pray
that
god
may
have
mercy
on
all
drowning
souls
or
think
what
a
picturesque
and
tragical
scene
it
was
and
what
a
beautiful
poem
it
will
make
when
we
have
thrown
it
into
an
artistic
form
and
bedizened
it
with
conceits
and
analogies
stolen
from
all
heaven
and
earth
by
our
own
fancy
elsley
vavasour
through
whose
spectacles
rather
than
with
my
own
eyes
i
have
been
looking
at
the
wreck
and
to
whose
account
not
to
mine
the
metaphors
and
similes
of
the
last
two
pages
must
be
laid
took
the
latter
course
not
that
he
was
not
awed
calmed
and
even
humbled
as
he
felt
how
poor
and
petty
his
own
troubles
were
compared
with
that
great
tragedy
but
in
his
fatal
habit
of
considering
all
matters
in
heaven
and
earth
as
bricks
and
mortar
for
the
poet
to
build
with
he
considered
that
he
had
seen
enough
as
if
men
were
sent
into
the
world
to
see
and
not
to
act
and
going
home
too
excited
to
sleep
much
more
to
go
and
kiss
forgiveness
to
his
sleeping
wife
sat
up
all
night
writing
the
wreck
which
may
be
as
the
reviewer
in
the
parthenon
asserts
an
exquisite
poem
but
i
can
not
say
that
it
is
of
much
importance
so
the
delicate
genius
sate
that
night
scribbling
verses
by
a
warm
fire
and
the
rough
lieutenant
settled
himself
down
in
his
mackintoshes
to
sit
out
those
weary
hours
on
the
bare
rock
having
done
all
that
he
could
do
and
yet
knowing
that
his
duty
was
not
to
leave
the
place
as
long
as
there
was
a
chance
of
saving
not
a
life
for
that
was
past
all
hope
but
a
chest
of
clothes
or
a
stick
of
timber
there
he
settled
himself
grumbling
yet
faithful
and
filled
up
the
time
with
sleepy
maledictions
against
some
old
admiral
who
had
or
had
not
taken
a
spite
to
him
in
the
west
indies
thirty
years
before
else
he
would
have
been
a
post
captain
by
now
comfortably
in
bed
on
board
a
crack
frigate
instead
of
sitting
all
night
out
on
a
rock
like
an
old
cormorant
etc
etc
who
knows
not
the
woes
of
ancient
lieutenants
but
as
it
befell
elsley
vavasour
was
justly
punished
for
going
home
by
losing
the
most
poetical
incident
of
the
whole
night
for
with
the
many
sailors
stayed
there
was
nothing
to
be
earned
by
staying
but
still
who
knew
but
they
might
be
wanted
and
they
hung
on
with
the
same
feeling
which
tempts
one
to
linger
round
a
grave
ere
the
earth
is
filled
in
loth
to
give
up
the
last
sight
and
with
it
the
last
hope
the
ship
herself
over
and
above
her
lost
crew
was
in
their
eyes
a
person
to
be
loved
and
regretted
and
gentleman
jan
spoke
like
a
true
sailor
ah
poor
dear
and
she
such
a
beauty
brown
as
any
one
might
see
by
her
lines
even
that
way
off
ah
poor
dear
and
so
many
brave
souls
on
board
and
perhaps
some
of
them
not
ready
beer
says
the
serious
elderly
chief
boatman
eh
captain
willis
the
lord
has
had
mercy
on
them
i
do
doubt
answers
the
old
man
in
his
quiet
sweet
voice
one
ca
but
hope
that
he
would
give
them
time
for
one
prayer
before
all
was
over
and
having
been
drowned
myself
brown
three
times
and
taken
up
for
dead
that
is
once
in
gibraltar
bay
and
once
when
i
was
a
total
wreck
in
the
old
seahorse
that
was
in
the
hurricane
in
the
indies
after
that
when
i
fell
over
here
fishing
for
bass
why
i
know
well
how
quick
the
prayer
will
run
through
a
man
heart
when
he
and
the
light
of
conscience
too
all
one
life
in
one
minute
like
it
ar
the
men
i
care
for
says
gentleman
jan
they
gone
to
heaven
like
all
brave
sailors
do
as
dies
by
wreck
and
battle
but
the
poor
dear
ship
d
see
captain
willis
she
no
heaven
to
go
to
and
that
why
i
feel
for
her
so
both
the
old
men
shake
their
heads
at
jan
doctrine
and
turn
the
subject
off
you
better
go
home
captain
of
the
rheumatics
it
a
rough
night
for
your
years
and
you
no
call
like
me
i
would
but
my
maid
there
and
i
ca
get
her
home
and
i
leave
her
and
willis
points
to
the
schoolmistress
who
sits
upon
the
flat
slope
of
rock
a
little
apart
from
the
rest
with
her
face
resting
on
her
hands
gazing
intently
out
into
the
wild
waste
make
her
go
it
her
duty
we
all
have
our
duties
why
does
her
mother
let
her
out
at
this
time
of
night
i
keep
my
maids
tighter
than
that
i
warrant
and
disciplinarian
brown
makes
a
step
towards
her
ah
brown
do
now
she
not
one
of
us
there
no
saying
what
going
on
there
in
her
maybe
she
praying
maybe
she
sees
more
than
we
do
over
the
sea
there
what
do
you
mean
there
no
living
body
in
those
breakers
be
sure
there
more
living
things
about
on
such
a
night
than
have
bodies
to
them
or
than
any
but
such
as
she
can
see
if
any
one
ever
talked
with
angels
that
maid
does
and
i
heard
her
too
i
can
say
i
have
certain
of
it
those
that
like
may
call
her
an
innocent
but
i
wish
i
were
such
an
innocent
brown
i
be
nearer
heaven
then
here
on
earth
than
i
fear
sometimes
i
ever
shall
be
even
after
dead
and
gone
well
she
a
good
girl
mazed
or
not
but
look
at
her
now
she
after
the
girl
had
raised
her
head
and
was
pointing
with
one
arm
stretched
stiffly
out
toward
the
sea
old
willis
went
down
to
her
and
touched
her
gently
on
the
shoulder
come
home
my
maid
then
you
take
cold
indeed
but
she
did
not
move
or
lower
her
arm
the
old
man
accustomed
to
her
fits
of
fixed
melancholy
looked
down
under
her
bonnet
to
see
whether
she
was
past
as
he
called
it
by
the
moonlight
he
could
see
her
great
eyes
steady
and
wide
open
she
motioned
him
away
half
impatiently
and
then
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
scream
a
man
a
man
save
him
as
she
spoke
a
huge
wave
rolled
in
and
shot
up
the
sloping
end
of
the
point
in
a
broad
sheet
of
foam
and
out
of
it
struggled
on
hands
and
knees
a
human
figure
he
looked
wildly
up
and
round
and
then
his
head
dropped
again
on
his
breast
and
he
lay
clinging
with
outspread
arms
like
homer
polypus
in
the
odyssey
as
the
wave
drained
back
in
a
thousand
roaring
cataracts
over
the
edge
of
the
rock
save
him
shrieked
she
again
as
twenty
men
rushed
forward
and
stopped
short
the
man
was
fully
thirty
yards
from
them
but
close
to
him
between
them
and
him
stretched
a
long
ghastly
crack
some
ten
feet
wide
cutting
the
point
across
all
knew
it
its
slippery
edge
its
polished
upright
sides
the
seething
cauldrons
within
it
and
knew
too
that
the
next
wave
would
boil
up
from
it
in
a
hundred
jets
and
suck
in
the
strongest
to
his
doom
to
fall
with
brains
dashed
out
into
a
chasm
from
which
was
no
return
ere
they
could
nerve
themselves
for
action
the
wave
had
come
up
the
slope
it
went
one
half
of
it
burying
the
wretched
mariner
and
fell
over
into
the
chasm
the
other
half
rushed
up
the
chasm
itself
and
spouted
forth
again
to
the
moonlight
in
columns
of
snow
in
time
to
meet
the
wave
from
which
it
had
just
parted
as
it
fell
from
above
and
then
the
two
boiled
up
and
round
and
over
and
swirled
along
the
smooth
rock
to
their
very
feet
the
schoolmistress
took
one
long
look
and
as
the
wave
retired
rushed
after
it
to
the
very
brink
of
the
chasm
and
flung
herself
on
her
knees
she
mazed
no
she
not
almost
screamed
old
willis
in
mingled
pride
and
terror
as
he
rushed
after
her
the
wave
has
carried
him
across
the
crack
and
she
got
him
and
he
sprang
upon
her
and
caught
her
round
the
waist
now
if
you
be
men
shouted
he
as
the
rest
hurried
down
now
if
you
be
men
before
the
next
wave
comes
shouted
big
hands
together
and
make
a
line
and
he
took
a
grip
with
one
hand
of
the
old
man
waistband
and
held
out
the
other
for
who
would
to
seize
who
took
it
frank
headley
the
curate
who
had
been
watching
all
sadly
apart
longing
to
do
something
which
no
one
could
mistake
be
you
man
enough
asked
big
jan
doubtfully
try
said
frank
really
you
be
sir
said
jan
civilly
enough
means
no
offence
sir
your
heart
stout
enough
i
see
but
you
do
know
what
be
and
he
caught
the
hand
of
a
huge
fellow
next
him
while
frank
shrank
sadly
back
into
the
darkness
strong
hand
after
hand
was
clasped
and
strong
knee
after
knee
dropped
almost
to
the
rock
to
meet
the
coming
rush
of
water
and
all
who
knew
their
business
took
a
long
breath
they
might
have
need
of
one
it
came
and
surged
over
the
man
and
the
girl
and
up
to
old
throat
and
round
the
knees
of
jan
and
his
neighbour
and
then
followed
the
returning
and
every
limb
quivered
with
the
strain
but
when
the
cataract
had
disappeared
the
chain
was
still
unbroken
saved
and
a
cheer
broke
from
all
lips
save
those
of
the
girl
herself
she
was
as
senseless
as
he
whom
she
had
saved
they
hurried
her
and
him
up
the
rock
ere
another
wave
could
come
but
they
had
much
ado
to
open
her
hands
so
firmly
clenched
together
were
they
round
his
waist
gently
they
lifted
each
and
laid
them
on
the
rock
while
old
willis
having
recovered
his
breath
set
to
work
crying
like
a
child
to
restore
breath
to
his
maiden
run
for
heale
some
good
christian
but
frank
longing
to
escape
from
a
company
who
did
not
love
him
and
to
be
of
some
use
ere
the
night
was
out
was
already
to
the
village
on
that
very
errand
however
ere
the
doctor
could
be
stirred
out
of
his
boozy
slumbers
and
thrust
into
his
clothes
by
his
wife
the
schoolmistress
was
safe
in
bed
at
her
mother
house
and
the
man
weak
but
alive
carried
triumphantly
up
to
heale
door
which
having
been
kicked
open
the
sailors
insisted
in
carrying
him
right
upstairs
and
depositing
him
on
the
best
spare
bed
if
you
wo
come
to
your
patients
doctor
your
patients
shall
come
to
you
why
were
you
asleep
in
your
liquors
instead
of
looking
out
for
poor
wratches
like
a
christian
you
see
whether
his
bones
be
broke
and
his
medicines
proper
and
then
go
and
see
after
the
schoolmistress
she
worth
a
dozen
of
any
man
and
a
thousand
of
you
we
pay
for
like
men
and
if
you
do
we
break
every
bottle
in
your
shop
to
which
what
between
bodily
fear
and
real
old
heale
assented
and
so
ended
that
eventful
night
chapter
iv
flotsom
jetsom
and
lagend
about
nine
the
next
morning
gentleman
jan
strolled
into
heale
surgery
pipe
in
mouth
with
an
attendant
satellite
for
every
lion
poor
as
well
as
rich
in
country
as
in
town
must
needs
have
his
jackal
heale
surgery
or
in
plain
english
shop
was
a
doleful
hole
enough
in
such
dirt
and
confusion
as
might
be
expected
from
a
drunken
occupant
with
a
practice
which
was
only
not
decaying
because
there
was
no
rival
in
the
field
but
monopoly
made
the
old
man
as
it
makes
most
men
all
the
more
lazy
and
careless
and
there
was
not
a
drug
on
his
shelves
which
could
be
warranted
to
work
the
effect
set
forth
in
that
sanguine
and
too
trustful
book
the
pharmacopoeia
which
like
pecksniff
england
expects
every
man
to
do
his
duty
and
is
accordingly
as
the
lancet
and
letheby
know
too
well
grievously
disappointed
in
this
kennel
of
evil
savours
heale
was
slowly
trying
to
poke
things
into
something
like
order
and
dragging
out
a
few
old
drugs
with
a
shaky
hand
to
see
if
any
one
would
buy
them
in
a
vague
expectation
that
something
must
needs
have
happened
to
somebody
the
night
before
which
would
require
somewhat
of
his
art
and
he
was
not
disappointed
gentleman
jan
without
taking
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
dropped
his
huge
elbows
on
the
counter
and
his
chin
on
his
fists
took
a
look
round
the
shop
as
if
to
find
something
which
would
suit
him
and
then
i
say
doctor
gi
some
tackleum
some
diachylum
plaster
mr
beer
says
heale
meekly
what
for
then
to
tackle
my
shins
i
barked
cruel
against
king
arthur
nose
last
night
hard
in
the
bone
he
is
wish
i
was
as
hard
how
much
diachylum
will
you
want
then
mr
beer
well
i
do
know
let
see
and
jan
pulls
up
his
blue
trousers
and
pulls
down
his
grey
rig
and
furrows
and
considers
his
broad
and
shaggy
shins
matter
of
four
pennies
broad
two
to
each
leg
and
then
replaces
his
elbows
and
smokes
on
i
say
doctor
that
curate
come
out
well
last
night
i
shall
go
to
church
next
sunday
what
asks
the
satellite
after
you
upset
he
that
fashion
yesterday
i
do
care
what
you
thinks
says
jan
who
of
course
bullies
his
jackal
like
most
lions
but
i
goes
to
church
he
a
good
say
i
little
and
good
like
a
welshman
cow
and
clapped
me
on
the
back
when
we
got
the
man
and
the
maid
safe
and
says
done
our
side
old
fellow
and
stands
something
hot
all
round
what
more
in
at
the
mariner
i
say
doctor
where
he
as
we
hauled
ashore
i
go
up
and
see
not
now
then
beer
not
now
then
he
sleeping
indeed
he
is
like
any
child
so
much
the
better
we
wai
be
bothered
with
his
hollering
but
go
up
i
will
do
ye
let
me
now
i
be
as
still
as
a
maid
and
jan
kicked
off
his
shoes
and
marched
on
through
the
shop
while
heale
moaning
professional
ejaculations
showed
him
the
way
the
shipwrecked
man
was
sleeping
sweetly
and
little
was
to
be
seen
of
his
face
so
covered
was
it
with
dark
tangled
curls
and
thick
beard
ah
a
digger
by
the
beard
of
him
and
his
red
jersey
whispered
jan
as
he
bent
tenderly
over
the
poor
fellow
and
put
his
head
on
one
side
to
listen
to
his
breathing
beautiful
he
sleeps
to
be
sure
said
jan
and
a
chap
too
is
a
pity
to
wake
poor
wratch
and
he
perhaps
with
a
sweetheart
aboard
and
drownded
or
else
all
his
kit
let
sleep
so
long
as
he
can
he
find
all
out
soon
enough
god
help
him
and
big
jan
stole
down
the
stairs
gently
and
reverently
like
a
true
sailor
and
took
his
diachylum
and
went
off
to
plaster
his
shins
about
ten
minutes
afterwards
heale
was
made
aware
that
his
guest
was
awake
by
sundry
grunts
and
ejaculations
which
ended
in
a
series
of
long
and
doleful
whistles
and
then
broke
out
into
a
song
so
he
went
up
and
found
the
stranger
sitting
upright
in
bed
combing
his
curls
with
his
fingers
and
chaunting
unto
himself
a
cheerful
ditty
good
morning
doctor
quoth
he
as
his
host
entered
very
kind
of
you
this
hope
i
have
turned
a
better
man
than
myself
out
of
his
bed
delighted
to
see
you
so
well
very
near
drowned
though
we
were
pumping
at
your
lungs
for
a
full
half
hour
ah
nothing
though
for
an
experienced
professional
man
like
you
hum
speaks
well
for
your
discrimination
says
heale
flattered
very
young
person
though
his
beard
is
a
bit
how
did
you
know
then
that
i
was
a
doctor
by
the
reverend
looks
of
you
sir
besides
i
smelt
the
rhubarb
and
senna
all
the
way
and
knew
that
i
fallen
among
professional
brethren
then
this
valiant
mariner
which
sailed
across
the
sea
he
came
home
to
his
own
sweetheart
with
his
heart
so
full
of
glee
with
his
heart
so
full
of
glee
sir
and
his
pockets
full
of
gold
and
his
bag
of
drugget
with
many
a
nugget
as
heavy
as
he
could
hold
do
you
wish
yours
was
doctor
eh
eh
eh
sniggered
heale
mine
was
last
night
now
doctor
let
have
a
glass
of
hot
with
and
an
hour
more
sleep
and
then
kick
me
out
and
into
the
workhouse
was
anybody
else
saved
from
the
wreck
last
night
nobody
sir
said
heale
and
said
sir
because
in
spite
of
the
stranger
rough
looks
his
accent
or
rather
his
showed
him
that
he
had
fallen
in
with
a
very
different
and
probably
a
very
superior
stamp
of
man
to
himself
in
the
light
of
which
conviction
and
being
withal
a
old
soul
he
went
down
and
mixed
him
a
stiff
glass
of
water
answering
his
wife
remonstrances
by
the
party
is
a
bit
of
a
frantic
party
certainly
but
he
is
certainly
a
very
superior
party
and
has
the
true
gentleman
about
him
any
one
can
see
besides
he
shipwrecked
as
you
and
i
may
be
any
day
and
what
like
i
should
like
to
know
when
i
like
to
be
shipwrecked
or
you
either
says
heale
in
a
tone
slightly
savouring
of
indignation
and
contempt
you
think
of
nothing
but
but
she
let
the
doctor
take
the
glass
upstairs
nevertheless
a
few
minutes
afterwards
frank
came
in
and
inquired
for
the
shipwrecked
man
well
enough
in
body
sir
and
rather
requires
your
skill
than
mine
said
the
old
wo
you
walk
up
so
up
frank
was
shown
the
stranger
was
sitting
up
in
bed
capital
your
brandy
is
doctor
ah
sir
seeing
frank
it
is
very
kind
of
you
i
am
sure
to
call
on
me
i
presume
you
are
the
clergyman
but
before
frank
could
answer
heale
had
broken
forth
into
loud
praises
of
him
setting
forth
how
the
stranger
owed
his
life
entirely
to
his
superhuman
strength
and
courage
my
word
sir
said
the
stranger
looking
them
both
over
and
over
through
and
through
as
if
to
settle
how
much
of
all
this
he
was
to
believe
i
am
deeply
indebted
to
you
for
your
gallantry
i
only
wish
it
had
been
employed
on
a
better
subject
my
good
sir
said
frank
blushing
you
owe
your
life
not
to
me
i
would
have
helped
if
i
could
but
was
not
thought
worthy
by
our
sons
of
anak
here
your
actual
preserver
was
a
young
girl
and
frank
told
him
the
story
whew
i
hope
she
wo
expect
me
to
marry
her
as
handsome
beautiful
said
frank
money
the
village
schoolmistress
clever
a
sort
of
body
said
heale
a
very
puzzling
intellect
said
frank
ah
well
that
a
fair
excuse
for
declining
the
honour
i
ca
be
expected
to
marry
a
frantic
party
as
you
called
me
down
stairs
just
now
doctor
i
sir
yes
i
heard
no
offence
though
my
good
sir
but
i
the
ears
of
a
fox
i
hope
really
though
that
she
is
none
the
worse
for
her
heroic
flights
how
is
she
this
morning
mr
heale
well
poor
thing
a
little
last
night
but
kindly
when
i
went
in
last
whew
i
hope
she
has
not
fallen
in
love
with
me
she
may
fancy
me
her
property
a
private
waif
and
stray
better
send
for
the
officer
and
let
him
claim
me
as
belonging
to
the
admiralty
as
flotsom
jetsom
and
lagend
for
i
was
all
three
last
night
you
were
indeed
sir
said
frank
who
began
to
be
a
little
tired
of
this
levity
and
very
thankful
to
heaven
you
ought
to
be
frank
spake
this
in
a
somewhat
professional
tone
of
voice
at
which
the
stranger
arched
his
eyebrows
screwed
his
lips
up
and
laid
his
ears
back
like
a
horse
when
he
meditates
a
kick
you
must
be
better
acquainted
with
my
affairs
than
i
am
my
dear
sir
if
you
are
able
to
state
that
doctor
i
hear
a
patient
coming
into
the
surgery
extraordinary
power
of
hearing
to
be
sure
said
heale
toddling
down
stairs
while
the
stranger
went
on
looking
frank
full
in
the
face
now
that
old
fogy
gone
down
stairs
my
dear
sir
let
us
come
to
an
understanding
at
the
beginning
of
our
acquaintance
of
course
bound
by
your
cloth
to
say
that
sort
of
thing
to
me
just
as
i
am
bound
by
it
not
to
swear
in
your
company
but
you
allow
me
to
remark
that
it
would
be
rather
trying
even
to
your
faith
if
you
were
to
be
thrown
ashore
with
nothing
in
the
world
but
an
old
jersey
and
a
bag
of
tobacco
two
hundred
miles
short
of
the
port
where
you
hoped
to
land
with
fifteen
hundred
pounds
in
your
pocket
my
dear
sir
said
frank
after
a
pause
whatsoever
comes
from
our
father
hand
must
be
meant
in
love
lord
gave
and
the
lord
hath
taken
away
a
quaint
wince
passed
over
the
stranger
face
father
sir
that
fifteen
hundred
pounds
was
going
to
my
hand
from
whosesoever
hand
it
came
or
the
loss
of
it
and
now
what
is
to
become
of
the
poor
old
man
that
hussy
dame
fortune
only
knows
if
she
knows
her
own
mind
an
hour
together
which
i
very
much
doubt
i
worked
early
and
late
for
that
money
sir
up
to
my
knees
in
mud
and
water
let
it
be
enough
for
your
lofty
demands
on
poor
humanity
that
i
take
my
loss
like
a
man
with
a
whistle
and
a
laugh
instead
of
howling
and
cursing
over
it
like
a
baboon
let
talk
of
something
else
and
lend
me
five
pounds
and
a
suit
of
clothes
i
sha
run
away
with
them
for
as
i
been
thrown
ashore
here
here
i
shall
stay
frank
almost
laughed
at
the
free
and
easy
request
though
he
felt
at
once
pained
by
the
man
irreligion
and
abashed
by
his
stoicism
would
he
have
behaved
even
as
well
in
such
a
case
i
have
not
five
pounds
in
the
world
good
we
shall
understand
each
other
better
but
the
suit
of
clothes
you
shall
have
at
once
good
again
let
it
be
your
oldest
for
i
must
do
a
little
here
for
purposes
of
my
own
so
off
went
frank
to
fetch
the
clothes
puzzling
over
his
new
parishioner
the
man
was
not
altogether
well
bred
either
in
voice
or
manner
but
there
was
an
ease
a
confidence
a
sense
of
power
which
made
frank
feel
that
he
had
fallen
in
with
a
very
strong
nature
and
one
which
had
seen
many
men
and
many
lands
and
profited
by
what
it
had
seen
when
he
returned
he
found
the
stranger
busy
at
his
ablutions
and
gradually
appearing
as
a
somewhat
dapper
handsome
fellow
with
a
bright
grey
eye
a
short
nose
a
firm
small
mouth
a
broad
and
upright
forehead
across
the
left
side
of
which
ran
a
fearful
scar
that
a
shrewd
mark
said
he
as
he
caught
frank
eye
fixed
on
it
while
he
sat
coolly
arranging
himself
on
the
bedside
i
got
it
in
fair
fight
though
by
a
crow
tomahawk
in
the
rocky
mountains
and
here
another
token
lifting
up
his
black
curls
which
a
greek
robber
gave
me
in
the
morea
i
another
under
my
head
for
which
i
have
to
thank
a
tartar
and
one
or
two
more
little
remembrances
of
flood
and
field
up
and
down
me
perhaps
they
may
explain
to
you
why
i
take
life
and
death
so
coolly
i
looked
too
often
at
the
little
which
parts
them
to
care
much
for
either
now
let
me
trouble
you
any
longer
you
have
your
flock
to
see
to
i
doubt
you
find
me
at
church
on
sunday
i
always
do
at
rome
as
rome
does
then
you
will
stay
away
said
frank
with
a
sad
smile
ah
no
church
is
respectable
and
aristocratic
and
there
one
get
sent
to
a
place
unmentionable
ten
times
an
hour
by
some
inspired
tinker
beside
country
people
like
the
doctor
to
go
to
church
with
their
betters
and
the
very
fellows
who
go
to
the
methodist
meeting
themselves
would
think
it
in
me
to
walk
in
there
now
though
i
have
introduced
myself
not
knowing
the
name
of
my
kind
preserver
my
name
is
frank
headley
curate
of
the
parish
said
frank
smiling
though
he
saw
the
man
was
rattling
on
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
his
talking
on
serious
matters
and
mine
is
tom
thurnall
licentiate
of
the
universities
of
paris
glasgow
and
whilome
surgeon
of
the
good
clipper
hesperus
which
you
saw
wrecked
last
night
so
farewell
come
over
with
me
and
have
some
breakfast
no
thanks
you
be
busy
i
screw
some
out
of
old
bottles
here
and
now
said
tom
thurnall
to
himself
as
frank
left
the
room
to
begin
life
again
with
an
old
penknife
and
a
pound
of
honeydew
i
wonder
which
of
them
got
my
girdle
i
stick
here
till
i
find
out
that
one
thing
and
stop
the
notes
by
post
if
i
can
but
recollect
them
all
if
i
could
but
stop
the
nugget
too
so
saying
he
walked
down
into
the
surgery
and
looked
round
everything
was
in
confusion
cobwebs
were
over
the
bottles
and
armies
of
mites
played
at
behind
them
he
tried
a
few
drawers
and
found
that
they
stuck
fast
and
when
he
at
last
opened
one
its
contents
were
two
old
and
a
dirty
he
took
down
a
jar
marked
epsom
salts
and
found
it
full
of
welsh
snuff
the
next
which
was
labelled
cinnamon
contained
blue
vitriol
the
spatula
and
were
crusted
with
deposits
of
every
hue
the
drawer
had
not
a
dozen
whole
boxes
in
it
and
the
counter
was
a
quarter
of
an
inch
deep
in
deposit
of
every
vegetable
and
mineral
matter
including
ends
of
string
tobacco
ashes
and
broken
glass
tom
took
up
a
dirty
duster
and
set
to
work
coolly
to
clear
up
whistling
away
so
merrily
that
he
brought
in
heale
i
doing
a
little
in
the
way
of
business
you
see
then
you
really
are
a
professional
practitioner
sir
as
headley
informs
me
though
of
course
i
do
doubt
the
fact
said
heale
summoning
up
all
the
little
courage
he
had
to
ask
the
question
with
london
paris
and
glasgow
easy
enough
to
write
and
ascertain
the
fact
have
been
medical
officer
to
a
union
and
to
a
brazilian
have
seen
three
choleras
two
army
fevers
and
without
end
have
doctored
gunshot
wounds
in
the
two
texan
wars
in
one
paris
revolution
and
in
the
row
beside
accident
practice
in
every
country
from
california
to
china
and
round
the
world
and
back
again
there
a
fine
nest
of
weekes
friend
if
not
creation
acarus
horridus
and
tom
went
on
dusting
and
arranging
heale
had
been
fairly
taken
aback
by
the
imposing
list
of
acquirements
and
looked
at
his
guest
awhile
with
considerable
awe
suddenly
a
suspicion
flashed
across
him
which
caused
him
not
unseen
by
tom
a
start
and
a
look
of
wisdom
he
next
darted
out
of
the
shop
and
returned
as
rapidly
rather
redder
about
the
eyes
and
wiping
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
but
sir
though
though
began
he
but
of
course
you
will
allow
me
being
a
stranger
and
as
a
man
of
business
all
i
have
to
say
is
if
that
is
to
say
you
want
to
know
why
if
i
had
all
these
good
businesses
why
i
have
kept
them
ex
actly
stammered
heale
much
relieved
a
very
sensible
and
question
but
you
need
have
been
so
delicate
about
asking
it
as
to
want
a
screw
before
beginning
ah
you
a
wag
sir
keckled
the
old
man
i
tell
you
frankly
i
have
an
old
father
sir
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
and
a
man
of
science
once
in
as
good
a
country
practice
as
man
could
have
till
god
help
him
he
went
blind
sir
and
i
had
to
keep
him
and
have
still
i
went
over
the
world
to
make
my
fortune
and
never
made
it
and
sent
him
home
what
i
did
make
and
little
enough
too
at
last
in
my
despair
i
went
to
the
diggings
and
had
a
pretty
haul
i
need
say
how
much
that
matters
little
now
for
i
suppose
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
there
my
story
sir
and
a
poor
one
enough
it
is
for
the
dear
old
man
at
least
and
tom
voice
trembled
so
as
he
told
it
that
old
heale
believed
every
word
and
what
is
more
being
like
most
hard
drinkers
not
unused
to
the
melting
mood
wiped
his
eyes
fervently
and
went
off
for
another
drop
of
comfort
while
tom
dusted
and
arranged
on
till
the
shop
began
to
look
quite
smart
and
now
sir
when
the
old
man
came
back
business
is
business
and
beggars
must
not
be
choosers
i
do
want
to
meddle
with
your
practice
i
know
the
rules
of
the
profession
but
if
you
let
me
sit
here
and
mix
your
medicines
for
you
you
have
the
more
time
to
visit
your
patients
that
clear
and
perhaps
thought
he
to
drink
your
and
when
any
of
them
are
poisoned
by
me
it
will
be
time
to
kick
me
out
all
i
ask
is
bed
and
board
be
frightened
for
your
i
can
drink
water
i
done
it
many
a
time
for
a
week
together
in
the
prairies
and
been
thankful
for
a
in
the
day
but
sir
your
dignity
as
a
fiddlesticks
for
dignity
i
must
live
sir
only
lend
me
a
couple
of
sheets
of
paper
and
two
queen
heads
that
i
may
tell
my
friends
my
whereabouts
and
go
and
talk
it
over
with
heale
we
must
never
act
without
consulting
the
ladies
that
day
tom
sent
off
the
following
epistle

shuter
mumpsimus

adjure
thee
by

last
night
after

a
dirty
little
port
and

a
hospitable
fellow
and
ask
me
to
come
up

camp
with
you
mumpsimus

a
great
temptation

money
and
physic

natives
for
my
daily
bread

ha

gay
young
man
sir
careless
of
his
health
so
you
see
as
a
medical
man
sir
which
is
the
liberal
paper
this
one
very
good
and
tom
wrote
off
to
the
liberal
paper
that
evening
a
letter
which
bore
fruit
ere
the
week
end
in
the
shape
of
five
columns
headed
thus
wreck
of
the
hesperus
the
following
detailed
account
of
this
lamentable
catastrophe
has
been
kindly
contributed
by
the
graphic
pen
of
the
only
survivor
thomas
thurnall
esquire
late
surgeon
on
board
the
vessel
which
five
columns
not
only
put
a
couple
of
guineas
into
tom
pocket
but
as
he
intended
they
should
brought
him
before
the
public
as
an
interesting
personage
and
served
as
a
very
good
advertisement
to
the
practice
which
tom
had
already
established
in
fancy
tom
had
not
worked
long
however
before
the
lieutenant
bustled
in
he
had
trotted
home
to
shave
and
get
his
breakfast
and
was
trotting
back
again
to
the
shore
hillo
heale
can
i
see
the
fellow
who
was
saved
last
night
i
am
that
fellow
says
tom
the
dickens
you
are
you
seem
to
have
fallen
on
your
legs
quickly
enough
it
a
trick
i
had
occasion
to
learn
sir
says
tom
can
i
prescribe
for
you
this
morning
medicine
roars
the
lieutenant
laughing
catch
me
at
it
no
i
want
you
to
come
down
to
the
shore
and
help
to
identify
goods
and
things
the
wind
has
chopped
up
north
and
is
blowing
dead
on
and
with
this
tide
we
shall
have
a
good
deal
on
shore
so
if
strong
enough
i
always
strong
enough
to
do
my
duty
said
tom
hum
very
good
sentiment
young
man
always
strong
enough
for
hum
worthy
of
nelson
said
pretty
much
the
same
did
he
something
about
duty
i
know
it
was
and
always
thought
it
uncommon
now
then
what
can
you
tell
me
about
this
business
it
was
a
sad
story
but
no
sadder
than
hundreds
beside
they
had
been
struck
by
the
gale
to
the
westward
two
days
before
with
the
wind
south
had
lost
their
foretopmast
and
boltsprit
and
become
all
but
unmanageable
had
tried
during
a
lull
to
rig
a
but
were
prevented
by
the
gale
which
burst
on
them
with
fresh
fury
from
the
with
very
heavy
rain
and
fog
had
passed
a
light
in
the
night
which
they
took
for
scilly
but
which
must
have
been
the
longships
had
still
fancied
that
they
were
safe
running
up
channel
with
a
wide
berth
when
about
sunset
the
gale
had
chopped
again
to
and
tom
knew
no
more
i
was
standing
on
the
poop
with
the
captain
about
ten
the
last
words
he
said
to
me
were
this
lasts
we
shall
see
brest
harbour
when
she
struck
and
stopped
dead
i
was
chucked
clean
off
the
poop
and
nearly
overboard
but
brought
up
in
the
mizen
rigging
where
the
captain
went
poor
fellow
heaven
alone
knows
for
i
never
saw
him
after
the
mainmast
went
like
a
carrot
the
mizen
stood
i
ran
round
to
the
there
were
four
men
steering
the
wheel
had
broke
out
of
the
poor
fellows
hands
and
knocked
them
over
broken
their
limbs
i
believe
i
was
stooping
to
pick
them
up
when
a
sea
came
into
the
waist
and
then
aft
washing
me
in
through
the
among
the
poor
women
and
children
queer
sight
lieutenant
seen
a
good
many
but
never
worse
than
that
i
bolted
to
my
cabin
tied
my
notes
and
gold
round
me
and
out
again
did
desert
the
poor
things
could
if
i
tried
they
clung
to
me
like
a
swarm
of
bees
sir
that
was
hard
lines
to
have
all
the
pretty
women
one
had
waltzed
with
every
evening
through
the
trades
and
the
little
children
one
had
been
making
playthings
for
holding
round
one
knees
and
screaming
to
the
doctor
to
save
them
and
how
the
was
i
to
save
them
sir
cried
tom
with
a
sudden
burst
of
feeling
which
as
in
so
many
englishmen
exploded
in
anger
to
avoid
melting
in
tears
ought
to
be
a
law
against
it
sir
growled
the
lieutenant
against
and
children
going
to
sea
it
murder
and
cruelty
been
wrecked
scores
of
times
but
it
was
with
honest
men
who
could
shift
for
themselves
and
if
they
were
drowned
drowned
but
screech
and
catch
hold
i
could
stand
that
well
well
there
was
a
pretty
little
creature
an
officer
widow
and
two
children
i
caught
her
under
one
arm
and
one
of
the
children
under
the
other
said
ca
take
you
all
at
once
i
come
back
for
the
rest
one
by
one
not
that
i
believed
it
but
anything
to
stop
the
screaming
and
i
did
hope
to
put
some
of
them
out
of
the
reach
of
the
sea
if
i
could
get
them
forward
i
knew
the
forecastle
was
dry
for
the
chief
officer
was
firing
there
you
heard
him
yes
five
or
six
times
and
then
he
stopped
suddenly
he
had
we
got
out
i
could
see
her
nose
up
in
the
air
forty
feet
above
us
covered
with
passengers
i
warped
the
lady
and
the
children
upward
heaven
knows
how
for
the
sea
was
breaking
over
us
very
sharp
till
we
were
at
the
mainmast
stump
and
holding
on
by
the
wreck
of
it
i
felt
the
ship
stagger
as
if
a
whale
had
struck
her
and
heard
a
roar
and
a
swish
behind
me
and
looked
back
just
in
time
to
see
mizen
and
poop
and
all
the
poor
women
and
children
in
it
go
bodily
as
if
they
had
been
shaved
off
with
a
knife
i
suppose
that
altered
her
balance
for
before
i
could
turn
again
she
dived
forward
and
then
rolled
over
upon
her
beam
ends
to
leeward
and
i
saw
the
sea
walk
in
over
her
from
stem
to
stern
like
one
white
wall
and
i
was
washed
from
my
hold
and
it
was
all
over
what
became
of
the
lady
i
saw
a
white
thing
flash
by
to
leeward
what
the
use
of
asking
but
the
child
you
held
i
did
let
it
go
till
there
was
good
reason
eh
tom
tapped
the
points
of
his
fingers
smartly
against
the
side
of
his
head
and
then
went
on
in
the
same
cynical
drawl
which
he
had
affected
throughout
i
heard
that
against
a
piece
of
timber
as
we
went
overboard
and
as
a
medical
man
i
considered
after
that
that
i
had
done
my
duty
pretty
little
boy
it
was
just
six
years
old
and
such
a
fancy
for
drawing
the
lieutenant
was
quite
puzzled
by
tom
seeming
nonchalance
what
do
you
mean
sir
did
you
leave
the
child
to
perish
confound
you
sir
if
you
will
have
plain
english
here
it
is
i
tell
you
i
heard
the
child
skull
crack
like
an
there
talk
no
more
about
it
or
the
whole
matter
it
a
bad
business
and
i
not
answerable
for
it
or
you
either
so
let
go
and
do
what
we
are
answerable
for
and
identify
sir
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
recollect
said
the
lieutenant
with
ruffled
plumes
i
do
i
do
i
beg
your
pardon
a
thousand
times
i
sure
for
being
so
rude
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
sir
there
are
a
good
many
things
in
the
world
which
wo
stand
too
much
thinking
over
and
last
night
was
one
very
true
very
true
but
how
did
you
get
ashore
i
get
ashore
oh
well
enough
why
not
sir
you
were
near
enough
being
drowned
at
last
only
that
girl
pluck
saved
you
well
but
it
did
save
me
and
here
i
am
as
i
knew
i
should
be
when
i
first
struck
out
from
the
ship
knew
that
is
a
bold
word
for
mortal
man
at
sea
i
suppose
it
is
but
we
doctors
you
see
get
into
the
way
of
looking
at
things
as
men
of
science
and
the
ground
of
science
is
experience
and
to
judge
from
experience
it
takes
more
to
kill
me
than
i
have
yet
met
with
if
i
had
been
going
to
be
snuffed
out
it
would
have
happened
long
ago
hum
it
well
to
carry
a
cheerful
heart
but
the
pitcher
goes
often
to
the
well
and
comes
home
broken
at
last
i
must
be
a
pitcher
i
think
then
or
else
a
sweet
little
cherub
who
sits
up
aloft
etc
as
dibdin
has
it
now
look
at
the
facts
yourself
sir
continued
the
stranger
with
a
recklessness
half
true
half
assumed
to
escape
from
the
malady
of
thought
i
do
want
to
boast
sir
i
only
want
to
show
you
that
i
have
some
practical
reason
for
wearing
as
my
motto
say
die
i
have
had
the
cholera
twice
and
beside
five
several
times
i
have
had
bullets
through
me
i
have
been
bayoneted
and
left
for
dead
i
have
been
shipwrecked
three
times
and
once
as
now
i
was
the
only
man
who
escaped
i
have
been
fatted
by
savages
for
baking
and
eating
and
got
away
with
a
couple
of
friends
only
a
day
or
two
before
the
feast
one
really
narrow
chance
i
had
which
i
never
expected
to
squeeze
through
but
on
the
whole
i
have
taken
full
precautions
to
prevent
its
recurrence
what
was
that
then
i
have
been
hanged
sir
said
the
doctor
quietly
hanged
cried
the
lieutenant
facing
round
upon
his
strange
companion
with
a
visage
which
asked
plainly
enough
you
hanged
i
do
believe
you
and
if
you
have
been
hanged
what
have
you
been
doing
to
get
hanged
you
need
not
take
care
of
your
pockets
sir
neither
robbery
nor
murder
was
it
which
brought
me
to
the
gallows
but
innocent
the
fact
is
i
was
caught
by
a
party
of
mexicans
during
the
last
war
straggling
after
plants
and
insects
and
hanged
as
a
spy
i
do
blame
the
fellows
i
had
no
business
where
i
was
and
they
could
not
conceive
that
a
man
would
risk
his
life
for
a
few
butterflies
but
if
you
were
hanged
sir
why
did
i
not
die
by
my
usual
luck
the
fellows
were
clumsy
and
the
noose
would
not
work
so
that
the
mexican
doctor
who
meant
to
dissect
me
brought
me
round
again
and
being
a
freemason
as
i
am
stood
by
me
got
me
safe
off
and
cheated
the
devil
the
worthy
lieutenant
walked
on
in
silence
stealing
furtive
glances
at
tom
as
if
he
had
been
a
guest
from
the
other
world
but
not
disbelieving
his
story
in
the
least
he
had
seen
as
most
old
navy
men
so
many
strange
things
happen
that
he
was
prepared
to
give
credit
to
any
tale
when
told
as
tom
was
with
a
straightforward
and
unboastful
simplicity
there
lives
the
girl
who
saved
you
said
he
as
they
passed
grace
harvey
door
ah
i
ought
to
call
and
pay
my
respects
but
grace
was
not
at
home
the
wreck
had
emptied
the
school
and
grace
had
gone
after
her
scholars
to
the
beach
we
could
keep
her
away
weak
as
she
was
said
a
neighbour
as
soon
as
she
heard
the
poor
corpses
were
coming
ashore
hum
said
tom
true
woman
quaint
that
appetite
for
horrors
the
sweet
creatures
have
did
you
ever
see
a
man
hanged
lieutenant
no
if
you
had
you
would
have
seen
two
women
in
the
crowd
to
one
man
can
you
make
out
the
philosophy
of
that
i
suppose
they
like
it
as
some
people
do
hot
peppers
or
donkeys
thistles
find
a
little
pain
pleasant
i
had
a
patient
once
in
france
who
read
dumas
célèbres
all
the
week
and
the
des
saints
on
sundays
and
both
as
far
as
i
could
see
for
just
the
same
purpose
to
see
how
miserable
people
could
be
and
how
much
pinching
and
pulling
they
could
bear
so
they
walked
on
along
a
and
over
the
spur
and
down
to
the
cove
it
was
such
a
morning
as
often
follows
a
gale
when
the
great
firmament
stares
down
upon
the
ruin
which
it
has
made
bright
and
clear
and
bold
and
seems
to
say
with
shameless
smile
there
i
have
done
it
and
am
as
merry
as
ever
after
it
all
beneath
a
cloudless
sky
the
breakers
still
grey
and
foul
from
the
tempest
were
tumbling
in
before
a
cold
northern
breeze
half
a
mile
out
at
sea
the
rough
backs
of
the
chough
and
crow
loomed
black
and
sulky
in
the
foam
at
their
feet
the
rocks
and
shingle
of
the
cove
were
alive
with
human
beings
groups
of
women
and
children
clustering
round
a
corpse
or
a
chest
sailors
in
the
surf
hauling
at
floating
spars
and
ropes
pacing
up
and
down
in
charge
of
goods
while
groups
of
farmers
men
who
had
hurried
down
from
the
villages
inland
lounged
about
on
the
top
of
the
cliff
looking
sulkily
on
hoping
for
plunder
and
yet
half
afraid
to
mingle
with
the
sailors
below
who
looked
on
them
as
an
inferior
race
and
refused
in
general
to
intermarry
with
them
the
lieutenant
plainly
held
much
the
same
opinion
for
as
a
party
of
them
tried
to
descend
the
narrow
path
to
the
beach
he
shouted
after
them
to
come
back
eh
you
wo
and
out
rattled
from
its
scabbard
the
old
sword
come
back
i
say
you
loafing
miching
wrecking
there
are
no
pickings
for
you
here
brown
send
those
fellows
back
with
the
bayonet
none
but
allowed
on
the
beach
and
the
labourers
go
up
again
grumbling
ca
trust
those
landsharks
they
plunder
even
the
rings
off
a
corpse
fingers
they
think
every
wreck
a
godsend
i
known
them
after
they
been
driven
off
roll
great
stones
over
the
cliff
at
night
on
the
just
out
of
spite
while
these
here
i
can
depend
on
them
can
you
tell
me
the
reason
of
that
as
you
seem
a
bit
of
a
philosopher
it
is
easy
enough
the
sailors
have
a
with
sailors
and
the
landsmen
have
none
besides
the
sailors
are
finer
fellows
body
and
soul
and
the
reason
is
that
they
have
been
brought
up
to
face
danger
and
the
landsmen
have
well
said
the
lieutenant
unless
a
man
has
been
taught
to
look
death
in
the
face
he
never
will
grow
up
i
believe
to
be
much
of
a
man
at
all
danger
my
good
sir
is
a
better
schoolmaster
than
all
your
new
model
schools
diagrams
and
scientific
apparatus
it
made
our
forefathers
the
masters
of
the
sea
though
they
never
heard
of
popular
science
and
i
dare
say
could
one
out
of
ten
of
them
spell
their
own
names
this
sentiment
elicited
from
the
lieutenant
a
grunt
of
approbation
as
tom
intended
that
it
should
do
shrewdly
arguing
that
the
old
martinet
was
no
friend
to
the
modern
superstition
that
all
which
is
required
to
cast
out
the
devil
is
a
smattering
of
the
will
the
gentleman
see
the
corpses
asked
brown
we
have
fourteen
already
and
he
led
the
way
to
where
along
the
shingle
at
mark
lay
a
ghastly
row
some
fearfully
bruised
and
mutilated
cramped
together
by
the
others
with
the
peaceful
smile
which
showed
that
they
had
sunk
to
sleep
in
that
strange
amid
a
wilderness
of
pleasant
dreams
strong
men
lay
there
little
children
women
whom
the
sailors
wives
had
covered
decently
with
cloaks
and
shawls
and
at
their
heads
stood
grace
harvey
motionless
with
folded
hands
gazing
into
the
dead
faces
with
her
great
solemn
eyes
her
mother
and
captain
willis
stood
by
watching
her
with
a
sort
of
superstitions
awe
she
took
no
notice
either
of
thurnall
or
of
the
lieutenant
as
the
doctor
identified
the
bodies
one
by
one
without
a
remark
which
indicated
any
human
emotion
a
very
sensible
man
willis
said
the
lieutenant
apart
as
tom
knelt
awhile
to
examine
the
crushed
features
of
a
sailor
and
then
looking
up
said
simply
james
macgillivray
second
mate
cause
of
death
contusions
probably
by
the
fall
of
the
a
very
sensible
man
and
has
seen
a
deal
of
life
and
kept
his
eyes
open
but
a
terrible
one
talked
like
a
book
to
me
all
the
way
but
be
hanged
if
i
do
think
he
has
a
pound
shot
under
his
ribs
instead
of
a
doctor
thurnall
that
is
miss
harvey
the
young
person
who
saved
your
life
last
night
tom
rose
took
off
his
hat
frank
headley
and
made
her
a
bow
of
which
an
ambassador
need
not
have
been
ashamed
i
am
exceedingly
shocked
that
miss
harvey
should
have
run
so
much
danger
for
anything
so
worthless
as
my
life
she
looked
up
at
him
and
answered
not
him
but
her
own
thoughts
strange
is
it
not
that
it
was
a
duty
to
pray
for
all
these
poor
things
last
night
and
a
sin
to
pray
for
them
this
morning
grace
dear
interposed
her
mother
do
you
hear
the
gentleman
thanking
you
she
started
as
one
awaking
out
of
a
dream
and
looked
into
his
face
blushing
scarlet
good
heavens
what
a
beautiful
creature
said
tom
to
himself
as
quite
a
new
emotion
passed
through
him
quite
new
it
was
whatsoever
it
was
and
he
was
aware
of
it
he
had
had
his
passions
his
intrigues
in
past
years
and
prided
himself
few
men
more
on
understanding
women
but
the
expression
of
the
face
and
the
strange
words
with
which
she
had
greeted
him
added
to
the
broad
fact
of
her
having
offered
her
own
life
for
his
raised
in
him
a
feeling
of
chivalrous
awe
and
admiration
which
no
other
woman
had
ever
called
up
madam
he
said
again
i
can
repay
you
with
nothing
but
thanks
but
to
judge
from
your
conduct
last
night
you
are
one
of
those
people
who
will
find
reward
enough
in
knowing
that
you
have
done
a
noble
and
heroic
action
she
looked
at
him
very
steadfastly
blushing
still
thurnall
be
it
understood
was
at
least
while
his
face
was
in
the
state
in
which
heaven
intended
it
to
be
half
hidden
in
a
beard
a
very
fellow
and
to
use
mark
armsworth
description
as
hard
as
a
nail
as
fresh
as
a
rose
and
stood
on
his
legs
like
a
moreover
as
willis
said
approvingly
he
had
spoken
to
her
as
if
he
was
a
duke
and
she
was
a
duchess
besides
by
some
blessed
moral
law
the
surest
way
to
make
oneself
love
any
human
being
is
to
go
and
do
him
a
kindness
and
therefore
grace
had
already
a
tender
interest
in
tom
not
because
he
had
saved
her
but
she
him
and
so
it
was
that
a
strange
new
emotion
passed
through
her
heart
also
though
so
little
understood
by
her
that
she
put
it
forthwith
into
words
you
might
repay
me
she
said
in
a
sad
and
tender
tone
you
have
only
to
command
me
said
tom
wincing
a
little
as
the
words
passed
his
lips
then
turn
to
god
now
in
the
day
of
his
mercies
unless
you
have
turned
to
him
already
one
glance
at
tom
rising
eyebrows
told
her
what
he
thought
upon
those
matters
she
looked
at
him
sadly
lingeringly
as
if
conscious
that
she
ought
not
to
look
too
long
and
yet
unable
to
withdraw
her
ah
and
such
a
precious
soul
as
yours
must
be
a
precious
soul
all
taken
and
you
alone
left
god
must
have
high
things
in
store
for
you
he
must
have
a
great
work
for
you
to
do
else
why
are
you
not
as
one
of
these
oh
think
where
would
you
have
been
at
this
moment
if
god
had
dealt
with
you
as
with
them
where
i
am
now
i
suppose
said
tom
quietly
where
you
are
now
yes
where
i
ought
to
be
i
am
where
i
ought
to
be
now
i
suppose
if
i
had
found
myself
anywhere
else
this
morning
i
should
have
taken
it
as
a
sign
that
i
was
wanted
there
and
not
here
grace
heaved
a
sigh
at
words
which
were
certainly
startling
the
stoic
optimism
of
the
doctor
was
new
and
frightful
to
her
my
good
madam
said
he
the
part
of
scripture
which
i
appreciate
best
just
now
is
the
case
of
poor
job
where
satan
has
leave
to
rob
and
torment
him
to
the
utmost
of
his
wicked
will
provided
only
he
does
not
touch
his
life
i
wish
he
went
on
lowering
his
voice
to
tell
you
something
which
i
do
not
wish
publicly
talked
of
but
in
which
you
may
help
me
i
had
nearly
fifteen
hundred
pounds
about
me
when
i
came
ashore
last
night
sewed
in
a
belt
round
my
waist
it
is
gone
that
is
all
tom
looked
steadily
at
her
as
he
spoke
she
turned
pale
red
pale
again
her
lips
quivered
but
she
spoke
no
word
she
has
it
as
i
live
thought
tom
to
himself
thy
name
is
woman
the
canting
little
methodistical
humbug
she
must
have
slipped
it
off
my
waist
as
i
lay
senseless
i
suppose
she
means
to
keep
it
in
pawn
till
i
redeem
it
by
marrying
her
well
i
might
take
an
uglier
mate
certainly
but
when
i
do
enter
into
the
bitter
bonds
of
matrimony
i
should
like
to
be
sure
beforehand
that
my
wife
was
not
a
thief
why
then
did
not
tom
if
he
were
so
very
sure
of
grace
having
the
belt
charge
her
with
the
theft
because
he
had
found
out
already
how
popular
she
was
and
was
afraid
of
merely
making
himself
unpopular
because
too
he
took
for
granted
that
whosoever
had
his
belt
had
hidden
it
already
beyond
the
reach
of
a
search
warrant
and
because
after
all
an
honourable
shame
restrained
him
it
would
be
a
poor
return
to
the
woman
who
had
saved
his
life
to
charge
her
with
theft
the
next
morning
and
more
there
was
something
about
that
girl
face
which
had
made
him
feel
that
if
he
had
seen
her
put
the
belt
into
her
pocket
before
his
eyes
he
could
not
have
found
the
heart
to
have
sent
her
to
gaol
no
thought
he
i
get
it
out
of
her
or
whoever
has
it
and
stay
here
till
i
do
get
it
one
place
is
as
good
as
another
to
me
but
what
was
grace
saying
she
had
turned
after
two
or
three
minutes
astonished
silence
to
her
mother
and
captain
willis
belt
mother
uncle
what
is
this
the
gentleman
has
lost
a
belt
dear
me
a
belt
well
child
that
not
much
to
grieve
over
when
the
lord
has
spared
his
life
and
soul
from
the
pit
said
her
mother
somewhat
testily
you
do
understand
a
belt
i
say
full
of
money
fifteen
hundred
pounds
he
lost
it
last
night
uncle
speak
quick
did
you
see
a
belt
willis
shook
his
head
meditatively
i
do
and
yet
i
do
and
yet
i
do
again
my
brains
were
washed
out
of
me
i
know
however
sir
i
think
and
talk
it
over
with
you
too
for
if
it
be
in
the
village
found
it
ought
to
be
and
will
be
with
god
help
found
cried
grace
in
so
high
a
key
that
tom
entreated
her
to
calm
herself
and
not
make
the
matter
found
yes
and
shall
be
found
if
there
be
justice
in
heaven
shame
that
folk
should
turn
robbers
and
wreckers
mariners
too
and
manners
wives
who
should
be
praying
for
those
who
are
wandering
far
away
each
man
with
his
life
in
his
hand
ah
what
a
world
when
will
it
end
soon
too
soon
when
folk
rob
shipwrecked
men
but
you
will
find
your
belt
yes
sir
you
will
find
it
wait
till
you
have
learnt
to
do
without
it
man
does
not
live
by
bread
alone
do
you
think
he
lives
by
gold
only
be
patient
and
when
you
are
worthy
of
it
you
shall
find
it
again
in
the
lord
good
time
to
the
doctor
this
seemed
a
mere
burst
of
jargon
invented
for
the
purpose
of
hiding
guilt
and
his
faith
in
womankind
was
not
heightened
when
he
heard
grace
mother
say
to
willis
that
in
wrecks
and
fires
and
such
like
a
many
people
complained
of
having
lost
more
than
ever
they
had
oh
ho
my
old
lady
is
that
the
way
the
fox
is
gone
quoth
tom
to
that
trusty
counsellor
himself
and
began
carefully
scrutinising
harvey
face
it
had
been
very
handsome
it
was
still
very
clever
but
the
eyebrows
crushed
together
downwards
above
her
nose
and
rising
high
at
the
outer
corners
indicated
as
surely
as
the
restless
eye
a
character
furtive
capable
of
great
inconsistencies
possibly
of
great
deceits
you
do
look
me
in
the
face
old
lady
quoth
tom
to
himself
very
well
between
you
two
it
lies
unless
that
old
gentleman
implicates
himself
also
in
his
approaching
confession
he
took
his
part
at
once
well
well
you
will
oblige
me
by
saying
nothing
more
about
it
after
all
as
this
good
lady
says
the
loss
of
a
little
money
is
not
worth
complaining
over
when
one
has
escaped
with
life
good
morning
and
many
thanks
for
all
your
kindness
and
tom
made
another
grand
bow
and
went
off
to
the
lieutenant
grace
looked
after
him
awhile
as
one
stunned
and
then
turned
to
her
mother
let
us
go
home
go
home
why
there
dear
let
me
go
home
you
need
not
come
i
am
sick
of
this
world
is
it
not
enough
to
have
misery
and
death
and
she
pointed
to
the
row
of
corpses
but
we
must
have
sin
too
wherever
we
turn
meanness
and
theft
and
ingratitude
too
she
added
in
a
lower
tone
she
went
homeward
her
mother
in
spite
of
her
entreaties
accompanied
her
and
for
some
reason
or
other
did
not
lose
sight
of
her
all
that
day
or
for
several
days
after
meanwhile
willis
had
beckoned
the
doctor
aside
his
face
was
serious
and
sad
and
his
lips
were
trembling
this
is
a
very
shocking
business
sir
of
course
you
told
the
lieutenant
not
yet
my
good
sir
but
excuse
my
boldness
what
plainer
way
of
getting
it
back
from
the
rascal
whoever
he
is
wait
awhile
said
tom
i
have
my
reasons
but
sir
for
the
honour
of
the
place
the
matter
should
be
cleared
up
and
till
the
thief
found
suspicion
will
lie
on
a
dozen
innocent
men
myself
among
the
rest
for
that
matter
you
said
tom
smiling
i
do
know
who
i
have
the
honour
to
speak
to
but
you
do
look
much
like
a
gentleman
who
wishes
for
a
trip
to
botany
bay
the
old
man
chuckled
and
then
his
face
dropped
again
i
glad
you
take
the
thing
so
like
a
man
sir
but
it
is
really
no
laughing
matter
it
a
scoundrelly
job
only
fit
for
a
maltee
off
the
nix
mangeery
if
it
had
been
a
lot
of
those
carter
fellows
that
had
carried
you
up
i
could
have
understood
it
wrecking
born
in
the
bone
of
them
but
for
those
four
sailors
that
carried
you
up
sir
they
have
been
shot
sooner
i
known
from
boys
and
the
old
man
spoke
quite
fiercely
and
looked
up
his
lip
trembling
and
his
eye
moist
there
no
doubt
that
you
are
honest
whoever
is
not
thought
tom
so
he
ventured
a
further
question
then
you
were
by
all
the
while
all
the
while
who
more
and
that
just
what
puzzles
me
pray
do
speak
loud
said
tom
i
have
my
reasons
for
keeping
things
quiet
i
tell
you
sir
i
held
the
maid
and
big
john
beer
gentleman
jan
they
call
him
held
me
and
the
maid
had
both
her
hands
tight
in
your
belt
i
saw
it
as
plain
as
i
see
you
just
before
the
wave
covered
us
though
little
i
thought
what
was
in
it
and
should
never
have
remembered
you
had
a
belt
at
all
if
i
had
thought
over
things
in
the
last
five
minutes
well
sir
i
am
lucky
in
having
come
straight
to
the
fountain
head
and
must
thank
you
for
telling
me
so
frankly
what
you
know
tell
you
sir
what
else
should
one
do
but
tell
you
i
only
wish
i
knew
more
and
more
i
know
please
the
lord
and
you
excuse
an
old
sailor
though
not
of
your
rank
sir
saying
that
he
wonders
a
little
that
you
do
take
the
plain
means
of
knowing
more
yourself
may
i
take
the
liberty
of
asking
your
name
said
tom
who
saw
by
this
time
that
the
old
man
was
worthy
of
his
confidence
willis
at
your
service
sir
captain
they
call
me
though
i
none
i
was
on
board
of
his
majesty
ship
niobe
and
willis
raised
his
hat
with
such
an
air
that
tom
raised
his
in
return
then
captain
willis
let
me
have
five
words
with
you
apart
first
thanking
you
for
having
helped
to
save
my
life
i
very
glad
i
did
sir
and
thanked
god
for
it
on
my
knees
this
morning
but
you
excuse
me
sir
i
was
thinking
and
no
blame
to
me
more
of
saving
my
poor
maid
life
than
yours
and
no
offence
to
you
for
i
had
the
honour
of
knowing
you
but
for
her
i
have
been
drowned
a
dozen
times
over
no
offence
indeed
said
tom
and
hardly
knew
what
to
say
next
may
i
ask
is
she
your
niece
i
heard
her
call
you
uncle
oh
no
no
relation
only
i
look
on
her
as
my
own
poor
thing
having
no
father
and
she
always
calls
me
uncle
as
most
do
us
old
men
in
the
west
well
then
sir
said
tom
you
will
answer
for
none
of
the
four
sailors
having
robbed
me
i
said
it
sir
was
any
one
else
close
to
her
when
we
were
brought
ashore
no
one
but
i
brought
her
round
myself
and
who
took
her
home
her
mother
and
i
very
good
and
you
never
saw
the
belt
after
she
had
her
hands
in
it
no
i
sure
not
was
her
mother
by
her
when
she
was
lying
on
the
rock
no
came
up
afterwards
just
as
i
got
her
on
her
feet
humph
what
sort
of
a
character
is
her
mother
oh
a
tidy
person
enough
one
of
these
methodist
brianites
they
call
themselves
i
do
hold
with
them
though
i
do
go
to
chapel
at
whiles
but
there
are
good
ones
among
them
and
i
do
believe
she
one
though
she
a
little
fretful
at
times
keeps
a
little
shop
that
do
pay
over
well
and
those
preachers
live
on
her
a
good
deal
i
think
creeping
into
houses
and
making
long
prayers
you
know
the
text
well
now
captain
willis
i
do
want
to
hurt
your
feelings
but
do
you
not
see
that
one
of
two
things
i
must
believe
either
that
the
belt
was
torn
off
my
waist
and
washed
back
into
the
sea
as
it
may
have
been
after
all
or
else
that
do
you
mean
that
she
took
it
asked
willis
in
voice
of
such
indignant
astonishment
that
tom
could
only
answer
by
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
who
else
could
have
done
so
on
your
own
showing
sir
said
willis
slowly
i
thought
i
had
to
do
with
a
gentleman
but
i
have
my
doubts
of
it
now
a
poor
girl
risks
her
life
to
drag
you
out
of
that
sea
which
but
for
her
would
have
hove
your
body
up
to
lie
along
with
that
line
there
and
willis
pointed
to
the
ghastly
row
and
your
soul
gone
to
give
in
its
last
account
you
only
know
what
that
would
have
been
like
and
the
first
thing
you
do
in
payment
is
to
accuse
her
of
robbing
you
her
that
the
very
angels
in
heaven
i
believe
are
glad
to
keep
company
with
and
the
old
man
turned
and
paced
the
beach
in
fierce
excitement
captain
willis
said
tom
i
trouble
you
to
listen
patiently
and
civilly
to
me
a
minute
willis
stopped
drew
himself
up
and
touched
his
hat
mechanically
just
because
i
am
a
gentleman
i
have
not
accused
her
but
held
my
tongue
and
spoken
to
you
in
confidence
now
perhaps
you
will
understand
why
i
have
said
nothing
to
the
lieutenant
willis
looked
up
at
him
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
see
now
and
i
sorry
if
i
was
rude
but
it
took
me
aback
and
does
still
i
tell
you
sir
quoth
he
warming
again
whatever
true
that
false
you
wrong
there
if
you
never
are
wrong
again
and
you
say
so
yourself
before
you
known
her
a
week
no
sir
if
you
could
make
me
believe
that
i
should
never
believe
in
goodness
again
on
earth
but
hold
all
men
and
women
too
and
those
above
for
aught
i
know
that
are
greater
than
men
and
women
for
liars
together
what
was
to
be
answered
perhaps
only
what
tom
did
answer
my
good
sir
i
will
say
no
more
i
would
not
have
said
that
much
if
i
had
thought
i
should
have
pained
you
so
i
suppose
that
the
belt
was
washed
into
the
sea
why
not
why
not
indeed
sir
that
a
much
more
way
of
looking
at
it
than
to
blacken
your
own
soul
before
god
by
suspecting
that
sweet
innocent
creature
be
it
so
then
only
say
nothing
about
the
matter
and
beg
them
to
say
nothing
if
it
be
jammed
among
the
rocks
as
it
might
be
heavy
as
it
is
talking
about
it
will
only
set
people
looking
for
it
and
i
suppose
there
is
a
man
or
two
even
in
aberalva
who
would
find
fifteen
hundred
pounds
a
tempting
bait
if
again
some
one
finds
it
and
makes
away
with
it
he
will
only
be
the
more
careful
to
hide
it
if
he
knows
that
i
am
on
the
so
just
tell
miss
harvey
and
her
mother
that
i
think
it
must
have
been
lost
and
beg
them
to
keep
my
secret
and
now
shake
hands
with
me
the
best
plan
i
believe
though
bad
is
the
best
said
willis
holding
out
his
hand
and
he
walked
away
sadly
his
spirit
had
been
altogether
ruffled
by
the
imputation
on
grace
character
and
besides
the
chances
of
thurnall
recovering
his
money
seemed
to
him
very
small
in
five
minutes
he
returned
if
you
would
allow
me
sir
there
a
man
there
of
whom
i
should
like
to
ask
one
question
he
who
held
me
and
after
that
helped
to
carry
you
up
and
he
pointed
to
gentleman
jan
who
stood
dripping
from
the
waist
downward
over
a
chest
which
he
had
just
secured
just
let
us
ask
him
like
whether
you
had
a
belt
on
when
he
carried
you
up
you
may
trust
him
sir
he
knock
you
down
as
soon
as
look
at
you
but
tell
a
lie
never
they
went
to
the
giant
and
after
cordial
salutations
tom
propounded
his
question
carelessly
with
something
like
a
white
lie
it
no
great
matter
but
it
was
an
old
friend
you
see
with
fittings
for
my
knife
and
pistols
and
i
should
be
glad
to
find
it
again
jan
thrust
his
red
hand
through
his
black
curls
and
meditated
while
the
water
surged
round
his
ankles
never
a
belt
seed
i
sir
leastwise
while
you
were
in
my
hands
i
had
you
round
the
waist
all
the
way
up
so
no
one
could
have
took
it
off
why
should
they
and
i
undressed
you
myself
and
nothing
save
your
presence
was
there
to
get
off
but
jersey
and
trousers
and
a
lump
of
backy
against
your
skin
that
looked
the
right
sort
have
some
then
said
tom
pulling
out
the
as
for
the
belt
i
suppose
it
gone
to
choke
the
and
there
the
matter
ended
outwardly
at
least
but
only
outwardly
tom
had
his
own
opinion
gathered
from
grace
seemingly
guilty
face
and
to
it
he
held
and
called
old
willis
in
his
heart
a
old
dotard
who
had
been
taken
in
by
her
hypocrisy
and
tom
accompanied
the
lieutenant
on
his
dreary
errand
that
day
and
several
days
after
through
depositions
before
a
justice
interviews
with
lloyd
underwriters
and
all
the
sad
details
which
follow
a
wreck
ere
the
week
end
forty
bodies
and
more
had
been
recovered
and
brought
up
ten
or
twelve
at
a
time
to
the
churchyard
and
upon
the
down
and
laid
side
by
side
in
one
long
shallow
pit
where
frank
headley
read
over
them
the
blessed
words
of
hope
amid
the
sobs
of
women
and
the
grand
silence
of
stalwart
men
who
knew
not
how
soon
their
turn
might
come
and
after
each
procession
came
grace
harvey
with
all
her
little
scholars
two
and
two
to
listen
to
the
funeral
service
and
when
the
last
corpse
was
buried
they
planted
flowers
upon
the
mound
and
went
their
way
again
to
learn
hymns
and
read
their
bible
little
ministering
angels
to
whom
as
to
most
children
death
was
too
common
a
sight
to
have
in
it
aught
of
hideous
or
strange
and
this
was
the
end
of
the
good
ship
hesperus
and
all
her
gallant
crew
verily
however
important
the
mere
animal
lives
of
men
may
be
and
ought
to
be
at
times
in
our
eyes
they
never
have
been
so
to
judge
from
floods
and
earthquakes
pestilence
and
storm
in
the
eyes
of
him
who
made
and
loves
us
all
it
is
a
strange
fact
better
for
us
instead
of
shutting
our
eyes
to
it
because
it
interferes
with
our
modern
tenderness
of
pain
to
ask
honestly
what
it
means
chapter
the
way
to
win
them
so
for
a
week
or
more
tom
went
on
thrivingly
enough
and
became
a
general
favourite
in
the
town
heale
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
boarding
him
for
he
had
dinner
and
supper
thrust
on
him
every
day
by
one
and
another
who
were
glad
enough
to
have
him
for
the
sake
of
his
stories
and
songs
and
endless
fun
and
the
lieutenant
above
all
took
the
under
his
especial
patronage
and
was
paid
for
his
services
in
some
of
tom
incomparable
the
old
fellow
soon
found
that
the
doctor
knew
more
than
one
old
foreign
station
of
his
and
ended
by
pouring
out
to
him
his
ancient
wrongs
and
the
evil
doings
of
the
wicked
admiral
all
of
which
tom
heard
with
deepest
sympathy
and
surprise
that
so
much
naval
talent
had
remained
unappreciated
by
the
unjust
upper
powers
and
the
lieutenant
of
course
reported
of
him
accordingly
to
heale
a
very
civil
spoken
and
intelligent
youngster
heale
d
see
to
my
mind
and
you
ca
do
better
than
accept
his
offer
for
find
him
a
great
help
especially
among
the
ladies
d
see
they
like
a
chap
eh
mrs
jones
on
the
fourth
day
by
good
fortune
what
should
come
ashore
but
tom
own
chest
moneyless
alas
but
with
many
useful
matters
still
unspoilt
by
salt
water
so
all
went
well
and
indeed
somewhat
too
well
if
tom
would
have
let
it
in
the
case
of
miss
anna
maria
heale
the
doctor
daughter
she
was
just
such
a
girl
as
her
father
daughter
was
likely
to
be
a
short
stout
rosy
pretty
body
of
twenty
with
loose
red
lips
thwart
black
eyebrows
and
right
naughty
eyes
under
them
of
which
tom
took
good
heed
for
miss
heale
was
exceedingly
inclined
he
saw
to
make
use
of
them
in
his
behoof
let
others
who
have
experience
in
and
taste
for
such
matters
declare
how
she
set
her
cap
at
the
dapper
young
surgeon
how
she
rushed
into
the
shop
with
sweet
ten
times
to
find
her
father
and
not
finding
him
giggled
and
blushed
and
shook
her
shoulders
and
retired
to
peep
at
tom
through
the
glass
door
which
led
into
the
parlour
how
she
discovered
that
the
muslin
curtain
of
the
said
door
would
get
out
of
order
every
ten
minutes
and
at
last
called
thurnall
to
assist
her
in
rearranging
it
how
bolder
grown
she
came
into
the
shop
to
help
herself
to
various
matters
inquiring
tenderly
for
tom
health
and
giggling
vulgar
sentiments
about
absent
friends
and
hearts
left
behind
in
the
hope
of
fishing
out
whether
tom
had
a
sweetheart
or
not
how
at
last
she
was
minded
to
confide
her
own
health
to
tom
and
to
instal
him
as
her
private
physician
yea
and
would
have
made
him
feel
her
pulse
on
the
spot
had
he
not
luckily
found
some
assafoetida
and
therewith
so
perfumed
the
shop
that
her
nerves
of
which
she
was
always
talking
though
she
had
nerves
only
in
the
sense
wherein
a
sirloin
of
beef
has
them
forced
her
to
beat
a
retreat
but
she
returned
again
to
the
charge
next
day
and
rushed
bravely
through
that
fearful
smell
cleaver
in
hand
as
the
carrier
set
down
at
the
door
a
huge
box
all
the
way
from
london
and
directed
to
thomas
thurnall
esquire
she
would
help
to
open
it
and
so
she
did
while
old
heale
and
his
wife
stood
by
curious
he
with
a
maudlin
wonder
and
awe
for
he
regarded
tom
already
as
an
altogether
awful
and
incomprehensible
party
and
heale
with
a
look
of
incredulous
scorn
as
if
she
expected
the
box
to
be
a
mere
sham
filled
probably
with
shavings
for
from
reasons
best
known
to
herself
she
had
never
looked
pleasantly
on
the
arrangement
which
entrusted
to
tom
the
care
of
the
bottles
she
had
given
way
from
motives
of
worldly
prudence
even
of
necessity
for
heale
had
been
for
the
greater
part
of
the
week
quite
incapable
of
attending
to
his
business
but
black
envy
and
spite
were
seething
in
her
foolish
heart
and
seethed
more
and
more
fiercely
when
she
saw
that
the
box
did
not
contain
shavings
but
valuables
of
every
sort
and
kind
drugs
instruments
a
large
microscope
which
tom
delivered
out
of
miss
heale
fat
clumsy
fingers
only
by
strong
warnings
that
it
would
go
off
and
shoot
her
books
full
of
prints
of
unspeakable
monsters
and
finally
a
little
packet
containing
not
one
note
but
four
and
a
letter
which
tom
after
perusing
put
into
hands
with
a
look
of
honest
pride
the
mumpsimus
men
it
appeared
had
sent
round
the
hat
for
him
and
here
were
the
results
and
they
would
send
the
hat
round
again
every
month
if
he
wanted
it
or
if
he
would
come
up
board
lodge
and
wash
him
gratis
the
great
doctor
bellairs
house
physician
and
carver
the
famous
operator
names
at
which
heale
bowed
his
head
and
worshipped
sent
compliments
condolences
offers
of
employment
never
was
so
triumphant
a
testimonial
and
heale
in
his
simplicity
thought
himself
as
indeed
he
was
the
luckiest
of
country
doctors
while
heale
after
swelling
and
choking
for
five
minutes
tottered
into
the
back
room
and
cast
herself
on
the
sofa
in
violent
hysterics
as
she
came
round
again
tom
could
not
but
overhear
a
little
that
passed
and
this
he
overheard
among
other
matters
yes
heale
i
see
i
see
too
well
which
your
natural
blindness
sir
and
that
fatal
easiness
of
temper
will
bring
you
to
a
premature
grave
within
the
paupers
precincts
and
this
young
designing
infidel
with
his
science
and
his
magnifiers
and
his
callipers
and
philosophy
falsely
so
called
which
in
our
true
protestant
youth
there
was
none
nor
needed
none
to
supplant
you
in
your
old
age
and
take
the
bread
out
of
your
grey
hairs
which
he
will
bring
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
and
mine
likewise
which
am
like
my
poor
infant
here
of
only
too
sensitive
sensibilities
oh
anna
maria
my
child
my
poor
lost
child
which
i
can
feel
for
the
tenderness
of
the
inexperienced
heart
my
virgin
eve
which
the
serpent
has
entered
into
your
youthful
paradise
and
you
will
find
alas
too
late
that
you
have
warmed
an
adder
into
your
bosom
oh
ma
how
indelicate
giggled
anna
maria
evidently
not
displeased
if
you
do
mind
he
will
hear
you
and
i
should
never
be
able
to
look
him
in
the
face
again
and
therewith
she
looked
round
to
the
glass
door
what
more
passed
tom
did
not
choose
to
hear
for
he
began
making
all
the
bustle
he
could
in
the
shop
merely
saying
to
himself
that
flood
of
eloquence
is
symptomatic
enough
i
lay
my
life
the
old
dame
knows
her
way
to
the
laudanum
bottle
tom
next
business
was
to
ingratiate
himself
with
the
young
curate
he
had
found
out
already
cunning
fellow
that
any
extreme
intimacy
with
headley
would
not
increase
his
general
popularity
and
as
we
have
seen
already
he
bore
no
great
affection
to
the
cloth
in
general
but
the
curate
was
an
educated
gentleman
and
tom
wished
for
some
more
rational
conversation
than
that
of
the
lieutenant
and
heale
besides
he
was
one
of
those
men
with
whom
the
possession
of
power
sought
at
first
from
has
become
a
passion
a
species
of
sporting
which
he
follows
for
its
own
sake
to
whomsoever
he
met
he
must
needs
apply
the
moral
stethoscope
sound
him
lungs
heart
and
liver
put
his
tissues
under
the
microscope
and
try
conclusions
on
him
to
the
uttermost
they
might
be
useful
hereafter
for
knowledge
was
power
or
they
might
not
what
matter
every
fresh
specimen
of
humanity
which
he
examined
was
so
much
gained
in
general
knowledge
very
true
thomas
thurnall
provided
the
method
of
examination
be
the
sound
and
the
deep
one
which
will
lead
you
down
in
each
case
to
the
real
living
heart
of
humanity
but
what
if
your
method
be
altogether
a
shallow
and
a
cynical
one
savouring
much
more
of
gil
blas
than
of
paul
grounded
not
on
faith
and
love
for
human
beings
but
on
something
very
like
suspicion
and
contempt
you
will
be
but
too
likely
doctor
to
make
the
coarsest
mistakes
when
you
fancy
yourself
most
penetrating
to
mistake
the
mere
scurf
and
disease
of
the
character
for
its
healthy
organic
tissue
and
to
find
out
at
last
somewhat
to
your
confusion
that
there
are
more
things
not
only
in
heaven
but
in
the
earthiest
of
the
earth
than
are
dreamt
of
in
your
philosophy
you
have
already
set
down
grace
harvey
as
a
hypocrite
and
willis
as
a
dotard
will
you
make
up
your
mind
in
the
same
foolishness
of
that
frank
headley
is
a
merely
and
pedant
quite
unaware
that
he
is
living
an
inner
life
of
doubts
struggles
prayers
noble
hunger
after
an
ideal
of
moral
excellence
such
as
you
friend
tom
never
yet
dreamed
of
which
would
be
to
you
as
an
unintelligible
gibber
of
shadows
out
of
dreamland
but
which
is
to
him
the
only
reality
the
life
of
life
for
which
everything
is
to
be
risked
and
suffered
you
treat
his
opinions
though
he
never
thrusts
them
on
you
about
the
church
and
his
duty
and
the
souls
of
his
parishioners
with
civil
indifference
as
much
ado
about
nothing
and
his
rubrical
eccentricities
as
puerilities
you
have
already
made
up
your
mind
to
try
and
put
a
little
common
sense
into
him
not
because
it
is
any
concern
of
yours
whether
he
has
common
sense
or
not
but
because
you
think
that
it
will
be
better
for
you
to
have
the
parish
at
peace
but
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
how
noble
the
man
is
even
in
his
mistakes
how
that
one
thought
that
the
finest
thing
in
the
world
is
to
be
utterly
good
and
to
make
others
good
also
puts
him
three
heavens
at
least
above
you
you
most
unangelic
bemired
all
day
long
by
grubbing
after
vermin
what
if
his
idea
of
the
church
be
somewhat
too
narrow
for
the
year
of
grace
is
it
no
honour
to
him
that
he
has
such
an
idea
at
all
that
there
has
risen
up
before
him
the
vision
of
a
perfect
polity
a
divine
and
wonderful
order
linking
earth
to
heaven
and
to
the
very
throne
of
him
who
died
for
men
witnessing
to
each
of
its
citizens
what
the
world
tries
to
make
him
forget
namely
that
he
is
the
child
of
god
himself
and
guiding
and
strengthening
him
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
to
do
his
father
work
is
it
a
shame
to
him
that
he
has
seen
that
such
a
polity
must
exist
that
he
believes
that
it
does
exist
or
that
he
thinks
he
finds
it
in
its
highest
if
not
its
perfect
form
in
the
most
ancient
and
august
traditions
of
his
native
land
true
he
has
much
to
learn
and
you
may
teach
him
something
of
it
but
you
will
find
some
day
thomas
thurnall
that
granting
you
to
be
at
one
pole
of
the
english
character
and
frank
headley
at
the
other
he
is
as
good
an
englishman
as
you
and
can
teach
you
more
than
you
can
him
the
two
soon
began
to
pass
almost
every
evening
together
pleasantly
enough
for
the
reckless
and
rattling
manner
which
tom
assumed
with
the
mob
he
laid
aside
with
the
curate
and
showed
himself
as
agreeable
a
companion
as
man
could
need
while
tom
in
his
turn
found
that
headley
was
a
rational
and
man
who
even
where
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
differ
could
hear
an
adverse
opinion
put
sometimes
in
a
startling
shape
without
falling
into
any
of
those
male
hysterics
of
sacred
horror
which
are
the
usual
refuge
of
ignorance
and
stupidity
terrified
by
what
it
can
not
refute
and
soon
tom
began
to
lay
aside
the
reserve
which
he
usually
assumed
to
clergymen
and
to
tread
on
ground
which
headley
would
gladly
have
avoided
for
to
tell
the
truth
ever
since
tom
had
heard
of
grace
intended
dismissal
the
curate
opinions
had
assumed
a
practical
importance
in
his
eyes
and
he
had
vowed
in
secret
that
if
his
cunning
failed
him
not
turned
out
of
her
school
she
should
not
be
whether
she
had
stolen
his
money
or
not
she
had
saved
his
life
and
nobody
should
wrong
her
if
he
could
help
it
besides
perhaps
she
had
not
his
money
the
belt
might
have
slipped
off
in
the
struggle
some
one
else
might
have
taken
it
off
in
carrying
him
up
he
might
have
mistaken
the
shame
of
innocence
in
her
face
for
that
of
guilt
be
it
as
it
might
he
had
not
the
heart
to
make
the
matter
public
and
contented
himself
with
staying
at
aberalva
and
watching
for
every
hint
of
his
lost
treasure
by
which
it
befell
that
he
was
thinking
the
half
of
every
day
at
least
about
grace
harvey
and
her
face
was
seldom
out
of
his
eye
and
the
more
he
looked
at
it
either
in
fancy
or
in
fact
the
more
did
it
fascinate
him
they
met
but
rarely
and
then
interchanged
the
most
simple
and
modest
of
salutations
but
tom
liked
to
meet
her
would
have
gladly
stopped
to
chat
with
her
however
whether
from
modesty
or
from
a
guilty
conscience
she
always
hurried
on
in
silence
and
she
tom
request
to
her
through
willis
to
say
nothing
about
the
matter
she
had
obeyed
as
her
mother
also
had
done
that
tom
suspected
her
was
a
thought
which
never
crossed
her
mind
to
suspect
any
one
herself
was
in
her
eyes
a
sin
and
if
the
fancy
that
this
man
or
that
among
the
sailors
who
had
carried
tom
up
to
heale
might
have
been
capable
of
the
baseness
she
thrust
the
thought
from
her
and
prayed
to
be
forgiven
for
her
uncharitable
judgment
but
night
and
day
there
weighed
on
that
strange
and
delicate
spirit
the
shame
of
the
deed
as
heavily
if
possible
as
if
she
herself
had
been
the
doer
there
was
another
soul
in
danger
of
perdition
another
black
spot
of
sin
making
earth
hideous
to
her
the
village
was
disgraced
not
in
the
public
eyes
true
but
in
the
eye
of
heaven
and
in
the
eyes
of
that
stranger
for
whom
she
was
beginning
to
feel
an
interest
more
intense
than
she
ever
had
done
in
any
human
being
before
her
saintliness
for
grace
was
a
saint
in
the
truest
sense
of
that
word
had
long
since
made
her
free
of
that
communion
of
saints
which
consists
not
in
pharisaic
isolation
from
the
world
not
in
the
mutual
flatteries
and
congratulations
of
a
clique
but
which
bears
the
sins
and
carries
the
sorrows
of
all
around
whose
atmosphere
is
disappointed
hopes
and
plans
for
good
and
the
indignation
which
hates
the
sin
because
it
loves
the
sinner
and
sacred
fear
and
pity
for
the
miseries
of
those
who
might
be
so
runs
the
dream
and
will
run
till
it
becomes
a
waking
reality
strong
and
free
and
safe
by
being
good
and
wise
to
such
a
spirit
this
bold
cunning
man
had
come
and
a
brand
plucked
from
the
burning
and
yet
equally
unconscious
of
his
danger
and
thankless
for
his
respite
given
too
as
it
were
into
her
hands
tossed
at
her
feet
out
of
the
very
mouth
of
the
pit
why
but
that
she
might
save
him
a
far
duller
heart
a
far
narrower
imagination
than
grace
would
have
done
what
did
concentrate
themselves
round
the
image
of
that
man
with
all
the
love
of
woman
for
ere
long
grace
found
that
she
did
love
that
man
as
a
woman
loves
but
once
in
her
life
perhaps
in
all
time
to
come
she
found
that
her
heart
throbbed
her
cheek
flushed
when
his
name
was
mentioned
that
she
watched
almost
unawares
to
herself
for
his
passing
and
she
was
not
ashamed
at
the
discovery
it
was
a
sort
of
melancholy
comfort
to
her
that
there
was
a
great
gulf
fixed
between
them
his
station
his
acquirements
his
great
connections
and
friends
in
london
for
all
tom
matters
were
the
gossip
of
the
town
as
indeed
he
took
care
that
they
should
be
made
it
impossible
that
he
should
ever
think
of
her
and
therefore
she
held
herself
excused
for
thinking
of
him
without
any
fear
of
that
and
inordinate
affection
and
unsanctified
passions
which
her
religious
books
had
taught
her
to
dread
besides
he
was
not
a
christian
that
five
minutes
on
the
shore
had
told
her
that
and
even
if
her
station
had
been
the
same
as
his
she
must
not
be
unequally
yoked
with
an
unbeliever
and
thus
the
very
hopelessness
of
her
love
became
its
food
and
strength
the
feeling
which
she
would
have
checked
with
maidenly
modesty
had
it
been
connected
even
remotely
with
marriage
was
allowed
to
take
immediate
and
entire
dominion
and
she
held
herself
permitted
to
keep
him
next
her
heart
of
hearts
because
she
could
do
nothing
for
him
but
pray
for
his
conversion
and
pray
for
him
she
did
the
noble
guileless
girl
day
and
night
that
he
might
be
converted
that
he
might
prosper
and
become
perhaps
rich
at
least
useful
a
mighty
instrument
in
some
good
work
and
then
she
would
build
up
one
beautiful
castle
in
the
air
after
another
out
of
her
fancies
about
what
such
a
man
whom
she
had
invested
in
her
own
mind
with
all
the
wisdom
of
solomon
might
do
if
his
talents
were
sanctified
then
she
prayed
that
he
might
recover
his
lost
gold
when
it
was
good
for
him
that
he
might
discover
the
thief
no
that
would
only
involve
fresh
shame
and
sorrow
that
the
thief
then
might
be
brought
to
repentance
and
confession
and
restitution
that
was
the
solution
of
the
dark
problem
and
for
that
she
prayed
while
her
face
grew
sadder
and
sadder
day
by
day
for
a
while
over
and
above
the
pain
which
the
theft
caused
her
there
came
how
could
it
be
otherwise
sudden
pangs
of
regret
that
this
same
love
was
hopeless
at
least
upon
this
side
of
the
grave
inconsistent
they
were
with
the
chivalrous
unselfishness
of
her
usual
temper
and
as
such
she
dashed
them
from
her
and
conquered
them
after
a
while
by
a
method
which
many
a
woman
knows
too
well
it
was
but
one
cross
more
a
natural
part
of
her
destiny
the
child
of
sorrow
and
heaviness
of
heart
pleasure
in
joy
she
was
never
to
find
on
earth
she
would
find
it
then
in
grief
and
nursing
her
own
melancholy
she
went
on
her
way
sad
sweet
and
steadfast
and
lavished
more
care
and
tenderness
and
even
gaiety
than
ever
upon
her
neighbours
children
because
she
knew
that
she
should
never
have
a
child
of
her
own
but
there
is
a
third
damsel
to
whom
whether
more
or
less
engaging
than
grace
harvey
or
miss
heale
my
readers
must
needs
be
introduced
let
miss
heale
herself
do
it
with
eyes
full
of
jealous
curiosity
there
is
a
foreign
letter
for
thurnall
marked
montreal
and
sent
on
here
from
whitbury
said
she
one
morning
at
breakfast
and
in
a
significant
tone
for
the
address
was
evidently
in
a
woman
hand
for
me
ah
yes
i
see
said
tom
taking
it
carelessly
and
thrusting
it
into
his
pocket
wo
you
read
it
at
once
thurnall
i
sure
you
must
be
anxious
to
hear
from
friends
abroad
with
an
emphasis
on
the
word
friends
i
have
a
good
many
acquaintances
all
over
the
world
but
no
friends
that
i
am
aware
of
said
tom
and
went
on
with
his
breakfast
ah
but
some
people
are
more
than
friends
are
the
montreal
ladies
pretty
mr
thurnall
do
know
for
i
never
was
there
miss
heale
was
silent
being
mystified
and
moreover
not
quite
sure
whether
montreal
was
in
india
or
in
australia
and
not
willing
to
show
her
ignorance
she
watched
tom
through
the
glass
door
all
the
morning
to
see
if
he
read
the
letter
and
betrayed
any
emotion
at
its
contents
but
tom
went
about
his
business
as
usual
and
as
far
as
she
saw
never
read
it
at
all
however
it
was
read
in
due
time
for
finding
himself
in
a
lonely
place
that
afternoon
tom
pulled
it
out
with
an
anxious
face
and
read
a
letter
written
in
a
hasty
hand
underscored
at
every
fifth
word
and
plentifully
bedecked
with
notes
of
exclamation
what
my
dearest
friend
and
fortune
still
frowns
upon
you
your
father
blind
and
ruined
ah
that
i
were
there
to
comfort
him
for
your
sake
and
ah
that
i
were
anywhere
doing
any
drudgery
which
might
prevent
my
being
still
a
burden
to
my
benefactors
not
that
they
are
unkind
not
that
they
are
not
angels
i
told
them
at
once
that
you
could
send
me
no
more
money
till
you
reached
england
perhaps
not
then
and
they
answered
that
god
would
send
it
that
he
who
had
sent
me
to
them
would
send
the
means
of
supporting
me
and
ever
since
they
have
redoubled
their
kindness
but
it
is
intolerable
this
dependence
and
on
you
too
who
have
a
father
to
support
in
his
darkness
oh
how
i
feel
for
you
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
pay
a
price
for
this
dependence
i
must
needs
be
staid
and
sober
i
must
needs
dress
like
any
quakeress
i
must
not
read
this
book
nor
that
and
my
shelley
taken
from
me
i
suppose
because
it
spoke
too
much
though
of
course
the
reason
given
was
its
infidel
opinions
is
replaced
by
serious
call
is
all
right
and
good
i
doubt
not
but
it
is
very
dreary
as
dreary
as
these
black
and
brown
snake
fences
and
that
dreadful
dreadful
canadian
winter
which
is
past
which
went
to
my
very
heart
day
after
day
like
a
sword
of
ice
another
such
winter
and
i
shall
die
as
one
of
my
own
would
die
did
you
cage
him
here
and
prevent
him
from
fleeing
home
to
the
sunny
south
when
the
first
leaves
begin
to
fall
dear
children
of
the
sun
my
heart
goes
forth
to
them
and
the
whir
of
their
wings
is
music
to
me
for
it
tells
me
of
the
south
the
glaring
south
with
its
glorious
flowers
and
glorious
woods
its
luxuriance
life
fierce
enjoyments
let
fierce
sorrows
come
with
them
if
it
must
be
so
let
me
take
the
evil
with
the
good
and
live
my
rich
wild
life
through
bliss
and
agony
like
a
true
daughter
of
the
sun
instead
of
crystallising
slowly
here
into
ice
amid
countenances
rigid
with
respectability
sharpened
by
the
lust
of
gain
without
taste
without
emotion
without
even
sorrow
let
who
will
be
the
stagnant
crawling
in
its
ugly
ditch
to
turn
the
mill
let
me
be
the
wild
mountain
brook
which
foams
and
flashes
over
the
rocks
what
if
they
tear
it
it
leaps
them
nevertheless
and
goes
laughing
on
its
way
let
me
go
thus
for
weal
or
woe
and
if
i
sleep
awhile
let
it
be
like
the
brook
beneath
the
shade
of
fragrant
magnolias
and
luxuriant
vines
and
image
meanwhile
in
my
bosom
nothing
but
the
beauty
around
yes
my
friend
i
can
live
no
longer
this
dull
chrysalid
life
in
comparison
with
which
at
times
even
that
past
dark
dream
seems
tolerable
for
amid
its
lurid
smoke
were
flashes
of
brightness
a
slave
well
i
ask
myself
at
times
and
what
were
women
meant
for
but
to
be
slaves
free
them
and
they
enslave
themselves
again
or
languish
unsatisfied
for
they
must
love
and
what
blame
to
them
if
they
love
a
white
man
tyrant
though
he
be
rather
than
a
if
the
men
of
our
own
race
will
claim
us
let
them
prove
themselves
worthy
of
us
let
them
rise
exterminate
their
tyrants
or
failing
that
show
that
they
know
how
to
die
till
then
those
who
are
the
masters
of
their
bodies
will
be
the
masters
of
our
hearts
if
they
crouch
before
the
white
like
brutes
what
wonder
if
we
look
up
to
him
as
to
a
god
woman
must
worship
or
be
wretched
do
i
not
know
it
have
i
not
had
my
dream
too
beautiful
for
earth
was
there
not
one
whom
you
knew
to
hear
whom
call
me
slave
would
have
been
rapture
to
whom
i
would
have
answered
on
my
knees
master
i
have
no
will
but
yours
but
that
is
past
past
one
happiness
alone
was
possible
for
a
slave
and
even
that
they
tore
from
me
and
now
i
have
no
thought
no
purpose
save
revenge
these
good
people
bid
me
forgive
my
enemies
easy
enough
for
them
who
have
no
enemies
to
forgive
forgive
forgive
injustice
oppression
baseness
cruelty
forgive
the
devil
and
bid
him
go
in
peace
and
work
his
wicked
will
why
have
they
put
into
my
hands
these
last
three
years
books
worthy
of
a
free
nation
books
which
call
patriotism
divine
which
tell
me
how
in
every
age
and
clime
men
have
been
called
heroes
who
rose
against
their
conquerors
women
martyrs
who
stabbed
their
tyrants
and
then
died
hypocrites
did
their
grandfathers
meekly
turn
the
other
cheek
when
your
english
taxed
them
somewhat
too
heavily
do
they
not
now
teach
every
to
glory
in
their
own
revolution
their
own
declaration
of
independence
and
to
flatter
themselves
into
the
conceit
that
they
are
the
lords
of
creation
and
the
examples
of
the
world
because
they
asserted
that
sacred
right
of
resistance
which
is
discovered
to
be
unchristian
in
the
african
they
will
free
us
forsooth
in
good
time
is
it
to
be
in
god
good
time
or
in
their
own
if
we
will
but
be
patient
and
endure
the
the
scourge
the
and
shame
unspeakable
a
few
years
more
till
all
is
ready
and
safe
for
them
dreamers
as
well
as
hypocrites
what
nation
was
ever
freed
by
help
i
have
been
reading
history
to
see
you
do
not
know
how
much
i
have
been
reading
and
i
find
that
freemen
have
always
freed
themselves
as
we
must
do
and
as
they
will
never
let
us
do
because
they
know
that
with
freedom
must
come
retribution
that
our
southern
tyrants
have
an
account
to
render
which
the
cold
northerner
has
no
heart
to
see
him
pay
for
after
all
he
loves
the
southerner
better
than
the
slave
and
fears
him
more
also
what
if
the
southern
aristocrat
who
lords
it
over
him
as
the
panther
does
over
the
ox
should
transfer
as
he
has
threatened
many
a
time
the
cowhide
from
the
negro
loins
to
his
no
we
must
free
ourselves
and
there
lives
one
woman
at
least
who
having
gained
her
freedom
knows
how
to
use
it
in
eternal
war
against
all
tyrants
oh
i
could
go
down
i
think
at
moments
down
to
new
orleans
itself
with
a
brain
and
lips
of
fire
and
speak
words
you
know
how
i
could
speak
them
which
would
bring
me
in
a
week
to
the
scourge
perhaps
to
the
stake
the
scourge
i
could
endure
have
i
not
felt
it
already
do
i
not
bear
its
scars
even
now
and
glory
in
them
for
they
were
won
by
speaking
as
a
woman
should
speak
and
even
the
fire
have
not
women
been
martyrs
already
and
could
not
i
be
one
might
not
my
torments
madden
a
people
into
manhood
and
my
name
become
a
in
the
sacred
fight
and
yet
oh
my
friend
life
is
sweet
and
my
little
day
has
been
so
dark
and
gloomy
may
i
not
have
one
hour
sunshine
ere
youth
and
vigour
are
gone
and
my
southern
womanhood
wrinkles
itself
up
into
despised
old
age
oh
counsel
me
help
me
my
friend
my
preserver
my
true
master
now
so
brave
so
wise
so
under
whose
mask
of
cynicism
lies
hid
have
i
not
cause
to
know
it
the
heart
of
a
hero
marie
if
miss
heale
could
have
watched
tom
face
as
he
read
much
more
could
she
have
heard
his
words
as
he
finished
all
jealousy
would
have
passed
from
her
mind
for
as
he
read
the
cynical
smile
grew
sharper
and
sharper
forming
a
fit
prelude
for
the
little
fool
which
was
his
only
comment
i
thought
you
would
have
fallen
in
love
with
some
honest
farmer
years
ago
but
a
martyr
you
sha
be
even
if
i
have
to
send
for
you
hither
though
how
to
get
you
bread
to
eat
i
do
know
however
you
have
been
reading
your
book
it
seems
clever
enough
you
always
were
and
too
clever
so
you
could
go
out
as
governess
or
something
why
here
a
postscript
dated
three
months
afterwards
ah
i
see
this
letter
was
written
last
july
in
answer
to
my
australian
one
the
meaning
of
this
and
he
began
reading
again
i
wrote
so
far
but
i
had
not
the
heart
to
send
it
it
was
so
full
of
repinings
and
since
then
must
i
tell
the
truth
i
have
made
a
step
do
not
call
it
a
desperate
one
do
not
blame
me
for
your
blame
i
can
not
bear
but
i
have
gone
on
the
stage
there
was
no
other
means
of
independence
open
to
me
and
i
had
a
dream
i
have
it
still
that
there
if
anywhere
i
might
do
my
work
you
told
me
that
i
might
become
a
great
actress
i
have
set
my
heart
on
becoming
one
on
learning
to
move
the
hearts
of
men
till
the
time
comes
when
i
can
tell
them
show
them
in
living
flesh
and
blood
upon
the
stage
the
secrets
of
a
slave
sorrows
and
that
slave
a
woman
the
time
has
not
come
for
that
yet
here
but
i
have
had
my
success
already
more
than
i
could
have
expected
and
not
only
in
canada
but
in
the
states
i
have
been
at
new
york
acting
to
crowded
houses
ah
when
they
applauded
me
how
i
longed
to
speak
to
pour
out
my
whole
soul
to
them
and
call
upon
them
as
men
to
but
that
will
come
in
time
i
have
found
a
friend
who
has
promised
to
write
dramas
especially
for
me
merely
republican
ones
at
first
in
which
i
can
give
full
vent
to
my
passion
and
hurl
forth
the
eternal
laws
of
liberty
which
their
consciences
may
must
at
last
apply
for
themselves
but
soon
he
says
we
shall
be
able
to
dare
to
approach
the
real
subject
if
not
in
america
still
in
europe
and
then
i
trust
the
coloured
actress
will
stand
forth
as
the
championess
of
her
race
of
all
who
are
oppressed
in
every
capital
in
europe
save
alas
italy
and
the
austria
who
crushes
her
i
have
taken
i
should
tell
you
an
italian
name
it
was
better
i
thought
to
hide
my
african
taint
forsooth
for
awhile
so
the
wise
new
yorkers
have
been
feting
as
maria
cordifiamma
the
white
woman
for
am
i
not
fairer
than
many
an
italian
signora
whom
they
would
have
looked
upon
as
an
inferior
being
under
the
name
of
marie
lavington
though
there
is
finer
old
english
blood
running
in
my
veins
from
your
native
berkshire
they
say
than
in
any
a
who
hangs
upon
my
lips
address
me
henceforth
then
as
la
signora
maria
cordifiamma
i
am
learning
fast
by
the
by
to
speak
italian
i
shall
be
at
quebec
till
the
end
of
the
month
then
i
believe
i
come
to
london
and
we
shall
meet
once
more
and
i
shall
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
once
more
for
all
your
marvellous
kindness
humph
said
tom
after
a
while
well
she
is
old
enough
to
choose
for
herself
she
must
be
by
now
as
for
the
stage
i
suppose
it
is
the
best
place
for
her
better
at
least
than
turning
governess
and
going
mad
as
she
would
do
over
her
drudgery
and
her
dreams
but
who
is
this
friend
scribbler
or
political
refugee
or
perhaps
all
three
together
a
dark
lot
those
fellows
i
must
keep
my
eye
on
him
though
it
no
concern
of
mine
i
done
my
duty
by
the
poor
thing
the
devil
himself
ca
deny
that
but
somehow
if
this
worthy
plays
her
false
i
feel
very
much
as
if
i
should
be
fool
enough
to
try
whether
i
have
forgotten
my
chapter
vi
an
old
foe
with
a
new
face
this
child
head
is
dreadfully
hot
and
how
yellow
he
does
look
says
vavasour
fussing
about
in
her
little
nursery
oh
clara
what
shall
i
do
i
really
dare
not
give
them
any
more
medicine
myself
and
that
horrid
old
doctor
heale
is
worse
than
no
one
ah
says
clara
who
is
privileged
to
bemoan
herself
and
to
have
sad
confidences
made
to
her
if
we
were
but
in
town
now
to
see
chilvers
or
any
one
that
could
be
trusted
but
in
this
dreadful
place
do
talk
of
it
clara
oh
what
will
become
of
the
poor
children
and
vavasour
sits
down
and
cries
as
she
does
three
times
at
least
every
week
but
indeed
if
you
thought
you
could
trust
him
there
is
that
new
assistant
the
man
who
was
saved
from
the
wreck
why
nobody
knows
who
he
is
oh
but
indeed
he
is
a
very
nice
gentleman
i
can
say
that
and
so
wonderfully
clever
and
has
cured
so
many
people
already
they
say
and
got
down
a
lot
of
new
medicines
for
he
has
great
friends
among
the
doctors
in
town
and
such
a
wonderful
magnifying
glass
with
which
he
showed
me
himself
as
i
dropped
into
the
shop
promiscuous
such
horrible
things
in
a
drop
of
water
that
i
have
dared
hardly
to
wash
my
face
since
and
what
good
will
the
magnifying
glass
do
to
us
says
the
poor
little
irish
soul
laughing
up
through
its
tears
he
wo
want
it
to
see
how
ill
poor
frederick
is
i
sure
but
you
may
send
for
him
clara
i
go
myself
and
make
sure
says
clara
glad
enough
of
a
run
and
chance
of
a
chat
with
the
young
doctor
and
in
half
an
hour
thurnall
is
announced
though
vavasour
has
a
flannel
apron
on
for
she
will
wash
the
children
herself
in
spite
of
elsley
grumblings
tom
sees
that
she
is
a
lady
and
puts
on
accordingly
his
very
best
manner
which
as
his
experience
has
long
since
taught
him
is
no
manner
at
all
he
does
his
work
quietly
and
kindly
and
bows
himself
out
you
will
be
sure
to
send
the
medicine
immediately
mr
thurnall
i
will
bring
it
myself
madam
and
if
you
like
administer
it
i
think
the
young
gentleman
has
made
friends
with
me
sufficiently
already
tom
keeps
his
word
and
is
back
and
away
again
to
his
shop
in
a
marvellously
short
space
having
struck
a
fresh
root
as
he
calls
it
for
what
a
very
sensible
man
that
thurnall
is
says
lucia
to
elsley
an
hour
after
as
she
meets
him
coming
in
from
the
garden
where
he
has
been
polishing
his
wreck
i
am
sure
he
understands
his
business
he
was
so
kind
and
quiet
and
yet
so
ready
and
seemed
to
know
all
the
child
symptoms
beforehand
in
such
a
strange
way
i
do
hope
he
stay
here
i
feel
happier
about
the
poor
children
than
i
have
for
a
long
time
thurnall
asks
elsley
who
is
too
absorbed
in
the
wreck
to
ask
after
the
children
but
the
name
catches
his
ear
heale
new
assistant
the
man
who
was
wrecked
answers
she
too
absorbed
in
her
turn
in
the
children
to
notice
her
startled
face
thurnall
which
thurnall
do
you
know
the
name
it
not
a
common
one
says
she
moving
to
the
door
no
not
a
common
one
at
all
you
said
the
children
were
not
well
i
am
glad
that
you
thought
of
asking
after
the
poor
things
why
really
my
dear
but
before
he
can
finish
his
excuse
probably
not
worth
hearing
she
has
trotted
again
to
the
nest
and
is
as
busy
as
ever
possibly
clara
might
do
the
greater
part
of
what
she
does
and
do
it
better
but
still
are
they
not
her
children
let
those
who
will
call
a
mother
care
mere
animal
instinct
and
liken
it
to
that
of
the
sparrow
or
the
spider
shall
we
not
rather
call
it
a
divine
inspiration
and
doubt
whether
the
sparrow
and
the
spider
must
not
have
souls
to
be
saved
if
they
too
show
forth
that
faculty
of
maternal
love
which
is
of
all
human
feelings
most
inexplicable
and
most
and
therefore
surely
most
heavenly
if
that
does
not
come
down
straight
from
heaven
a
good
and
perfect
gift
then
what
is
heaven
and
what
the
gifts
which
it
sends
down
but
poor
elsley
may
have
had
solid
reasons
for
thinking
more
of
the
name
of
thurnall
than
of
his
children
health
we
will
hope
so
for
his
sake
for
after
sundry
melodramatic
pacings
and
starts
elsley
was
of
a
melodramatic
turn
and
fond
of
a
scene
even
when
he
had
no
spectator
not
even
a
besides
ejaculations
of
it
can
not
be
if
it
were
i
trust
not
a
fresh
ghost
to
torment
me
when
will
come
the
end
of
this
accursed
coil
which
i
have
wound
round
my
life
and
so
forth
he
decided
aloud
that
the
suspense
was
intolerable
and
enclosing
himself
in
his
poetical
cloak
and
mazzini
strode
down
to
the
town
and
into
the
shop
and
as
he
entered
it
his
heart
sank
to
his
midriff
and
his
knees
below
were
loosed
for
there
making
up
pills
in
a
pair
of
brown
holland
sleeves
of
his
own
manufacture
for
tom
was
a
good
seamster
as
all
travellers
should
be
whistled
lilliburlero
as
of
old
the
tom
of
other
days
which
elsley
muse
would
fain
have
buried
in
a
thousand
lethes
elsley
came
forward
to
the
counter
carelessly
nevertheless
after
a
moment
what
with
my
beard
and
the
lapse
of
time
thought
he
he
can
not
know
me
so
he
spoke
i
understand
you
have
been
visiting
my
children
sir
i
hope
you
did
not
find
them
seriously
indisposed
mr
vavasour
says
tom
with
a
low
bow
i
am
mr
vavasour
but
elsley
was
a
bad
actor
and
hesitated
and
coloured
so
much
as
he
spoke
that
if
tom
had
known
nothing
he
might
have
guessed
something
nothing
serious
i
assure
you
sir
unless
you
are
come
to
announce
any
fresh
symptom
oh
no
not
at
all
that
is
i
was
passing
on
my
way
to
the
quay
and
thought
it
as
well
to
have
your
own
assurance
vavasour
is
so
you
seem
to
partake
of
her
infirmity
sir
says
tom
with
a
smile
and
a
bow
however
it
is
one
which
does
you
both
honour
an
awkward
pause
i
hope
i
am
not
taking
a
liberty
sir
but
i
think
i
am
bound
to
what
in
heaven
is
he
going
to
say
thought
elsley
to
himself
feeling
very
much
inclined
to
run
away
thank
you
for
all
the
pleasure
and
instruction
which
your
writings
have
given
me
in
lonely
hours
and
lonely
places
too
your
first
volume
of
poems
has
been
read
by
one
man
at
least
beside
wild
watchfires
in
the
rocky
mountains
tom
did
not
say
that
he
pitched
the
said
volume
into
the
river
in
disgust
and
that
it
was
probably
long
since
used
up
as
house
material
by
the
of
those
parts
for
doubtless
there
are
caddises
there
as
elsewhere
poor
elsley
rose
at
the
bait
and
smiled
and
bowed
in
silence
i
have
been
so
long
absent
from
england
and
in
utterly
wild
countries
too
that
i
need
hardly
be
ashamed
to
ask
if
you
have
written
anything
since
soul
agonies
no
doubt
if
you
have
i
might
have
found
it
at
melbourne
on
my
way
home
but
my
visit
there
was
a
very
hurried
one
however
the
loss
is
mine
and
the
fault
too
as
i
ought
to
call
it
pray
make
no
excuses
says
elsley
delighted
i
have
written
of
course
who
can
help
writing
sir
while
nature
is
so
glorious
and
man
so
wretched
one
can
not
but
take
refuge
from
the
pettiness
of
the
real
in
the
contemplation
of
the
ideal
yes
i
have
written
i
will
send
you
my
last
book
down
i
do
know
whether
you
will
find
me
improved
how
can
i
doubt
that
i
shall
saddened
perhaps
perhaps
more
severe
in
my
taste
but
we
will
not
talk
of
that
i
owe
you
a
debt
sir
for
having
furnished
me
with
one
of
the
most
striking
i
ever
had
i
mean
that
miraculous
escape
of
yours
it
is
seldom
enough
in
this
dull
world
one
stumbles
on
such
an
incident
ready
made
to
one
hands
and
needing
only
to
be
described
as
one
sees
it
and
the
weak
vain
man
chatted
on
and
ended
by
telling
tom
all
about
his
poem
of
the
wreck
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
imply
that
he
had
done
tom
a
serious
favour
perhaps
raised
him
to
immortality
by
putting
him
in
a
book
tom
thanked
him
gravely
for
the
said
honour
bowed
him
at
last
out
of
the
shop
and
then
vaulted
back
clean
over
the
counter
as
soon
as
elsley
was
out
of
sight
and
commenced
an
indian
of
frantic
character
accompanying
himself
by
an
extemporary
chaunt
with
which
the
name
of
john
briggs
was
frequently
intermingled
if
i
do
know
you
johnny
my
boy
in
spite
of
all
your
beard
why
then
i
am
a
slower
fellow
than
ever
has
yet
appeared
oh
if
it
was
but
he
what
a
card
for
me
what
a
world
it
is
for
poor
honest
rascals
like
me
to
try
a
fall
with
why
did
i
take
bad
verse
to
make
and
call
it
poetry
and
so
make
up
to
an
earl
daughter
which
was
of
high
degree
but
perhaps
i
am
wrong
after
all
no
i
saw
he
knew
me
the
humbug
though
he
never
was
a
humbug
never
rose
above
the
rank
of
fool
however
i
make
assurance
doubly
sure
and
then
if
it
pays
me
not
to
tell
him
i
know
him
i
wo
tell
him
and
if
it
pays
me
to
tell
him
i
will
tell
him
just
as
you
choose
my
good
mr
poet
and
tom
returned
to
his
work
singing
an
extempore
parody
of
we
met
was
in
a
crowd
ending
with
and
thou
art
the
cause
of
this
anguish
my
in
a
howl
so
doleful
that
heale
marched
into
the
shop
evidently
making
up
her
mind
for
an
explosion
i
am
very
sorry
sir
to
have
to
speak
to
you
upon
such
a
subject
but
i
must
say
that
the
profane
songs
sir
which
our
house
is
not
at
all
accustomed
to
them
not
to
mention
that
at
your
time
of
life
and
in
your
position
sir
as
my
husband
assistant
though
there
no
saying
with
a
meaning
toss
of
the
head
how
long
it
may
last
and
there
her
grammar
having
got
into
a
hopeless
knot
she
stopped
tom
looked
at
her
cheerfully
and
fixedly
i
had
been
expecting
this
said
he
to
himself
better
show
the
old
cat
at
once
that
i
carry
claws
as
well
as
she
there
saying
madam
humbly
begging
your
pardon
how
long
my
present
engagement
will
last
it
will
last
just
as
long
as
i
like
heale
boiled
over
with
rage
but
ere
the
geyser
could
explode
tom
had
continued
in
that
dogged
nasal
yankee
twang
which
he
assumed
when
he
was
venomous
as
for
the
songs
there
are
two
ways
of
making
oneself
happy
in
this
life
you
can
judge
for
yourself
which
is
best
one
is
to
do
one
work
like
a
man
and
hum
a
tune
to
keep
one
spirits
up
the
other
is
to
let
the
work
go
to
rack
and
ruin
and
keep
one
spirits
up
if
one
is
a
gentleman
by
a
little
too
much
brandy
if
one
is
a
lady
by
a
little
too
much
laudanum
laudanum
sir
almost
screamed
heale
turning
pale
as
death
the
pint
bottle
of
best
laudanum
which
i
had
from
town
a
fortnight
ago
is
now
nearly
empty
i
will
make
affidavit
that
i
have
not
used
a
hundred
drops
or
drunk
one
i
suppose
it
was
the
cat
cats
have
queer
tastes
in
the
west
i
believe
i
have
heard
the
cat
coming
down
stairs
into
the
surgery
once
or
twice
after
i
was
in
bed
so
i
set
my
door
ajar
a
little
and
saw
her
come
up
again
but
whether
she
had
a
vial
in
her
paws
oh
sir
says
heale
bursting
into
tears
and
after
the
dreadful
toothache
which
i
have
had
this
fortnight
which
nothing
but
a
little
laudanum
would
ease
it
and
at
my
time
of
life
to
mock
a
poor
elderly
lady
infirmities
which
i
did
not
look
for
this
cruelty
and
outrage
dry
your
tears
my
dear
madam
says
tom
in
his
most
winning
tone
you
will
always
find
me
the
thorough
gentleman
i
am
sure
if
i
had
not
been
one
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
for
me
with
my
powerful
london
connections
though
i
wo
boast
to
set
up
in
opposition
to
your
good
husband
instead
of
saving
him
labour
in
his
good
old
age
only
my
dear
madam
how
shall
i
get
the
refilled
without
the
doctor
you
understand
the
wretched
old
woman
hurried
upstairs
and
brought
him
down
a
out
of
her
private
hoard
trembling
like
an
aspen
leaf
and
departed
so
scotched
but
not
killed
you
gossip
and
lie
too
never
trust
a
you
see
me
by
the
eye
of
imagination
committing
all
the
seven
deadly
sins
and
by
the
tongue
of
inspiration
go
forth
and
proclaim
the
same
at
the
i
ca
kill
you
and
i
ca
cure
you
so
i
must
endure
you
what
said
old
goethe
in
all
the
german
i
ever
cared
to
recollect
wallfisch
hat
doch
seine
laus
muss
auch
die
meine
haben
now
then
for
penberthy
draughts
i
wonder
how
that
pretty
schoolmistress
goes
on
if
she
were
but
honest
now
and
had
fifty
thousand
pounds
why
then
she
would
marry
me
and
so
why
now
i
would
marry
she
as
my
native
berkshire
grammar
would
render

chapter
vii
la
cordifiamma
this
chapter
shall
begin
good
reader
with
one
of
those
startling
bursts
of
illustration
with
which
our
most
popular
preachers
are
wont
now
to
astonish
and
edify
their
hearers
and
after
starting
with
them
at
the
opening
of
the
sermon
from
the
the
crystal
palace
or
the
nearest
float
them
safe
upon
the
gushing
stream
of
oratory
to
the
safe
and
shores
of
doctrinal
commonplace
lost
in
admiration
at
the
skill
of
the
good
man
who
can
thus
make
all
roads
lead
if
not
to
heaven
at
least
to
strong
language
about
its
opposite
true
the
logical
sequence
of
their
periods
may
be
like
that
of
the
coming
one
somewhat
questionable
reminding
one
at
moments
of
fluellen
comparison
between
macedon
and
monmouth
henry
the
fifth
and
alexander
but
in
the
logic
of
the
pulpit
all
well
that
ends
well
and
the
end
must
needs
sanctify
the
means
there
is
of
course
some
connection
or
other
between
all
things
in
heaven
and
earth
or
how
would
the
universe
hold
together
and
if
one
has
not
time
to
find
out
the
true
connection
what
is
left
but
to
invent
the
best
one
can
for
oneself
thus
argues
probably
the
popular
preacher
and
fills
his
pews
proving
thereby
clearly
the
excellence
of
his
method
so
argue
also
probably
the
popular
poets
to
whose
luxuriant
fancy
everything
suggests
anything
and
thought
plays
with
thought
down
one
page
and
up
the
next
till
one
fancies
at
moments
that
they
had
got
permission
from
the
higher
powers
before
looking
at
the
universe
to
stir
it
all
up
a
few
times
with
a
spoon
it
is
notorious
of
course
that
poets
and
preachers
alike
pride
themselves
upon
this
method
of
astonishing
that
the
former
call
it
seeing
the
infinite
in
the
finite
the
latter
pressing
secular
matters
into
the
service
of
the
sanctuary
and
other
pretty
phrases
which
for
reverence
sake
shall
be
omitted
no
doubt
they
have
their
reasons
and
their
reward
the
style
takes
the
style
pays
and
what
more
would
you
have
let
them
go
on
rejoicing
in
spite
of
the
cynical
pedants
in
the
saturday
review
who
dare
to
accuse
will
it
be
believed
these
luminaries
of
the
age
of
talking
merely
irreverent
nonsense
meanwhile
so
evident
is
the
success
sole
test
of
merit
which
has
attended
the
new
method
that
it
is
worth
while
trying
whether
it
will
not
be
as
taking
in
the
novel
as
it
is
in
the
chapel
and
therefore
the
reader
is
requested
to
pay
special
attention
to
the
following
paragraph
modelled
carefully
after
the
exordiums
of
a
famous
irish
preacher
now
drawing
crowded
houses
at
the
west
end
of
town
as
thus
it
is
the
pleasant
month
of
may
when
as
in
old
chaucer
time
the
smale
foules
maken
melodie
that
slepen
alle
night
with
open
eye
so
priketh
hem
nature
in
their
corages
then
longen
folk
to
goe
on
pilgrimages
and
specially
from
every
shire
end
of
englelond
to
they
wend
till
the
low
places
of
the
strand
blossom
with
white
cravats
those
lilies
of
the
valley
types
of
meekness
and
humility
at
least
in
the
pious
palmer
and
why
not
of
similar
virtues
in
the
undertaker
the
the
groom
the
the
croupier
at
the
and
frederick
augustus
lord
scoutbush
who
like
the
rest
is
just
getting
into
his
cab
at
the
door
of
the
theatre
to
spend
an
hour
at
kensington
before
sauntering
in
to
lady
m
ball
why
not
i
ask
at
least
in
the
case
of
little
scoutbush
for
guardsman
though
he
be
coming
from
a
theatre
and
going
to
a
ball
there
is
meekness
and
humility
in
him
at
this
moment
as
well
as
in
the
average
of
the
gentlemen
who
trotted
along
that
same
pavement
about
eleven
this
forenoon
why
should
not
his
white
cravat
like
theirs
be
held
symbolic
of
that
fact
however
scoutbush
belongs
rather
to
the
former
than
the
latter
of
categories
for
a
smale
foule
he
is
a
little
fellow
who
maketh
melodie
also
and
warbles
like
a
we
can
not
liken
him
to
any
more
dignified
songster
moreover
he
will
sleep
all
night
with
open
eye
for
he
will
not
be
in
bed
till
five
morning
and
pricked
he
is
and
that
sorely
in
his
courage
for
he
is
as
much
in
love
as
his
little
nature
can
be
with
the
new
actress
la
signora
cordifiamma
of
the
theatre
how
exquisitely
now
for
this
is
one
of
the
rare
occasions
in
which
a
man
is
permitted
to
praise
himself
is
established
hereby
an
unexpected
bond
of
linked
sweetness
long
drawn
out
between
things
which
had
ere
they
came
beneath
the
magic
touch
of
genius
no
more
to
do
with
each
other
than
this
book
has
with
the
stock
exchange
who
would
have
dreamed
of
travelling
from
the
tabard
in
southwark
to
the
last
new
singer
and
the
lilies
of
the
valley
and
touching
en
passant
on
to
cardinal
virtues
and
an
irish
viscount
but
see
given
only
a
little
impudence
and
less
logic
and
hey
presto
the
thing
is
done
and
all
that
remains
to
be
done
is
to
dilate
as
the
rev
dionysius
would
do
at
this
stage
of
the
process
upon
the
moral
question
which
has
been
so
cunningly
raised
and
to
inquire
firstly
how
the
virtues
of
meekness
and
humility
could
be
predicated
of
frederick
augustus
just
viscount
scoutbush
and
baron
torytown
in
the
peerage
of
ireland
and
secondly
how
those
virtues
were
called
into
special
action
by
his
questionably
wise
attachment
to
a
new
actress
to
whom
he
had
never
spoken
a
word
in
his
life
first
then
little
freddy
scoutbush
as
his
compeers
irreverently
termed
him
was
by
common
consent
of
her
majesty
guards
a
good
fellow
whether
the
james
street
definition
of
that
adjective
be
the
perfect
one
or
not
we
will
not
stay
to
inquire
but
in
the
guards
it
meant
this
that
scoutbush
had
not
an
enemy
in
the
world
because
he
deserved
none
that
he
lent
and
borrowed
not
gave
and
asked
not
again
envied
not
hustled
not
slandered
not
never
bore
malice
never
said
a
cruel
word
never
played
a
dirty
trick
would
hear
a
fellow
troubles
out
to
the
end
and
if
he
could
not
counsel
at
least
would
not
laugh
at
them
and
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
lived
and
let
live
and
was
accordingly
a
general
favourite
his
morality
was
neither
better
nor
worse
than
the
average
of
his
companions
but
if
he
was
sensual
he
was
at
least
not
base
and
there
were
frail
women
who
blessed
little
freddy
and
his
shy
and
secret
generosity
from
having
saved
them
from
the
lowest
pit
he
was
idle
frivolous
useless
but
with
these
two
palliating
facts
that
he
knew
it
and
regretted
it
and
that
he
never
had
a
chance
of
being
aught
else
his
father
and
mother
had
died
when
he
was
a
child
he
had
been
sent
to
eton
at
seven
where
he
learnt
nothing
and
into
the
guards
at
seventeen
where
he
learnt
less
than
nothing
his
aunt
old
lady
knockdown
who
was
a
kind
old
irish
woman
an
and
now
a
high
evangelical
professor
but
as
worldly
as
her
neighbours
in
practice
had
tried
to
make
him
a
good
boy
in
old
times
but
she
had
given
him
up
long
before
he
left
eton
as
a
vessel
of
wrath
which
he
certainly
was
with
his
hot
irish
temper
and
since
then
she
had
only
spoken
of
him
with
moans
and
to
him
just
as
if
he
and
she
had
made
a
compact
to
be
as
worldly
as
they
could
and
as
if
the
fact
that
he
was
going
as
she
used
to
tell
her
private
friends
straight
to
the
wrong
place
was
to
be
utterly
ignored
before
the
pressing
reality
of
getting
him
and
his
sisters
well
married
and
so
it
befell
that
lady
knockdown
like
many
more
having
begun
with
too
high
or
at
least
precise
a
spiritual
standard
was
forced
to
end
practically
in
having
no
standard
at
all
and
that
for
ten
years
of
scoutbush
life
neither
she
nor
any
other
human
being
had
spoken
to
him
as
if
he
had
a
soul
to
be
saved
or
any
duty
on
earth
save
to
eat
drink
and
be
merry
and
all
the
while
there
was
a
quaint
and
pathetic
consciousness
in
the
little
man
heart
that
he
was
meant
for
something
better
that
he
was
no
fool
and
was
not
intended
to
be
one
he
would
thrust
his
head
into
lectures
at
the
polytechnic
and
the
british
institution
with
a
dim
endeavour
to
guess
what
they
were
all
about
and
a
envy
of
the
clever
fellows
who
knew
about
science
and
all
that
he
would
sit
and
listen
puzzled
and
admiring
to
the
talk
of
statesmen
and
confide
his
woe
afterwards
to
some
ah
if
i
had
had
the
chance
now
that
my
cousin
chalkclere
has
if
i
had
had
two
or
three
tutors
and
a
good
mother
too
keeping
me
in
a
coop
and
cramming
me
with
learning
as
they
cram
chickens
for
the
market
i
fancy
i
could
have
shown
my
comb
and
hackles
in
the
house
as
well
as
some
of
them
i
fancy
i
could
make
a
speech
in
parliament
now
with
the
help
of
a
little
irish
impudence
if
i
only
knew
anything
to
speak
about
so
scoutbush
clung
in
a
childish
way
to
any
superior
man
who
would
take
notice
of
him
and
not
treat
him
as
the
fribble
which
he
seemed
he
had
taken
to
that
artist
claude
mellot
of
late
simply
from
admiration
of
his
brilliant
talk
about
art
and
poetry
and
boldly
confessed
that
he
preferred
one
of
mellot
orations
on
the
sublime
and
beautiful
though
he
did
understand
a
word
of
them
to
the
songs
and
jokes
very
excellent
ones
in
their
way
of
hector
harkaway
the
distinguished
irish
novelist
and
boon
companion
of
her
majesty
life
guards
green
his
special
intimate
and
mentor
however
was
a
certain
major
campbell
of
whom
more
hereafter
who
however
being
a
and
perhaps
somewhat
pharisaic
person
made
heavier
demands
on
scoutbush
conscience
than
he
had
yet
been
able
to
meet
for
fully
as
he
agreed
that
hercules
choice
between
pleasure
and
virtue
was
the
right
one
still
he
could
not
yet
follow
that
ancient
hero
along
the
thorny
path
and
confined
his
conception
of
duty
to
the
minimum
guard
and
drill
he
had
estates
in
ireland
which
had
almost
cleared
themselves
during
his
long
minority
but
which
since
the
famine
had
cost
him
about
as
much
as
they
brought
him
in
and
estates
in
the
west
which
with
a
welsh
brought
him
in
some
seven
or
eight
thousand
and
so
kept
his
poor
little
head
above
water
to
look
pitifully
round
the
universe
longing
for
the
life
of
him
to
make
out
what
it
all
meant
and
hoping
that
somebody
would
come
and
tell
him
so
much
for
his
meekness
and
humility
in
general
as
for
the
particular
display
of
those
virtues
which
he
has
shown
it
must
be
understood
that
he
has
given
a
promise
to
mellot
not
to
make
love
to
la
cordifiamma
and
on
that
only
condition
has
been
allowed
to
meet
her
at
one
of
claude
mellot
petits
soupers
la
cordifiamma
has
been
staying
ever
since
she
came
to
england
with
the
mellots
in
the
wilds
of
brompton
unapproachable
there
as
in
all
other
places
in
public
she
is
a
very
zenobia
who
keeps
all
animals
of
the
other
sex
at
an
awful
distance
and
of
the
fifty
young
puppies
who
are
raving
about
her
beauty
her
air
and
her
voice
not
one
has
obtained
an
introduction
while
claude
whose
studio
used
to
be
a
favourite
lounge
of
young
guardsmen
has
as
civilly
as
he
can
closed
his
doors
to
those
magnificent
personages
ever
since
the
new
singer
became
his
guest
claude
mellot
seems
to
have
come
into
a
fortune
of
late
years
large
enough
at
least
for
his
few
wants
he
paints
no
longer
save
when
he
chooses
and
has
taken
a
little
old
house
in
one
of
those
back
lanes
of
brompton
where
islands
of
primaeval
nursery
garden
still
remain
undevoured
by
the
advancing
surges
of
the
brick
and
mortar
deluge
there
he
lives
happy
in
a
green
lawn
and
windows
opening
thereon
in
three
elms
a
cork
an
ilex
and
a
mulberry
with
a
great
standard
pear
for
flower
and
foliage
the
queen
of
all
suburban
trees
there
he
lies
on
the
lawn
upon
strange
skins
the
summer
day
playing
with
cats
and
dogs
and
making
love
to
his
sabina
who
has
not
lost
her
beauty
in
the
least
though
she
is
on
the
wrong
side
of
he
deludes
himself
too
into
the
belief
that
he
is
doing
something
because
he
is
writing
a
treatise
on
the
principles
of
beauty
which
will
be
published
probably
about
the
time
the
thames
is
purified
in
the
season
of
latter
lammas
and
the
greek
kalends
and
the
more
certainly
so
because
he
has
wandered
into
the
abyss
of
conic
sections
and
curves
of
double
curvature
of
which
if
the
truth
must
be
spoken
he
knows
no
more
than
his
friends
of
the
life
guards
green
to
this
charming
little
nest
has
lord
scoutbush
procured
an
admission
after
abject
supplication
to
sabina
who
pets
him
because
he
is
musical
and
solemn
promises
neither
to
talk
or
look
any
manner
of
foolishness
my
dearest
mellot
says
the
poor
wretch
i
will
be
good
indeed
i
will
i
will
not
even
speak
to
her
only
let
me
sit
and
look
and
and
why
i
thought
you
understood
all
about
such
things
and
could
pity
a
poor
fellow
who
was
spoony
and
sabina
who
prides
herself
much
on
understanding
such
things
and
on
having
indeed
reduced
them
to
a
science
in
which
she
gives
gratuitous
lessons
to
all
young
gentlemen
and
ladies
of
her
acquaintance
receives
him
pityingly
in
that
delicious
little
back
whither
whosoever
enters
is
in
no
hurry
to
go
out
again
claude
house
is
arranged
with
his
usual
defiance
of
all
conventionalities
dining
or
proper
there
is
none
the
large
front
room
is
the
studio
where
he
and
sabina
eat
and
drink
as
well
as
work
and
paint
but
out
of
it
opens
a
little
room
the
walls
of
which
are
so
covered
with
gems
of
art
where
the
rogue
finds
money
to
buy
them
is
a
puzzle
that
the
eye
can
turn
nowhere
without
taking
in
some
new
beauty
and
wandering
on
from
picture
to
statue
from
portrait
to
landscape
dreaming
and
learning
afresh
after
every
glance
at
the
back
a
glass
bay
has
been
thrown
out
and
forms
a
little
conservatory
for
ever
fresh
and
gay
with
tropic
ferns
and
flowers
gaudy
orchids
dangle
from
the
roof
creepers
hide
the
framework
and
you
hardly
see
where
the
room
ends
and
the
begins
and
in
the
centre
an
ottoman
invites
you
to
lounge
it
costs
claude
money
doubtless
but
he
has
his
excuse
having
once
seen
the
tropics
i
can
not
live
without
some
from
their
lost
paradises
and
which
is
the
wiser
plan
to
spend
money
on
a
horse
and
brougham
which
we
do
care
to
use
and
on
scrambling
into
society
at
the
price
of
one
great
stupid
party
a
year
or
to
make
our
little
world
as
pretty
as
we
can
and
let
those
who
wish
to
see
us
take
us
as
they
find
us
in
this
nest
as
claude
and
sabina
call
it
sacred
to
the
everlasting
billing
and
cooing
of
that
sweet
little
pair
of
human
who
have
built
it
was
supper
set
la
cordifiamma
all
the
more
beautiful
from
the
languor
produced
by
the
excitement
of
acting
lay
upon
a
sofa
claude
attended
talking
earnestly
sabina
according
to
her
custom
was
fluttering
in
and
out
and
arranging
supper
with
her
own
hands
both
husband
and
wife
were
as
busy
as
bees
and
yet
any
one
accustomed
to
watch
the
little
ins
and
outs
of
married
life
could
have
seen
that
neither
forgot
for
a
moment
that
the
other
was
in
the
room
but
basked
and
purred
like
two
blissful
cats
each
in
the
sunshine
of
the
other
presence
and
he
could
have
seen
too
that
la
cordifiamma
was
divining
their
thoughts
and
studying
all
their
little
expressions
perhaps
that
she
might
use
them
on
the
stage
perhaps
too
happy
in
sympathy
with
their
happiness
and
yet
there
was
a
shade
of
sadness
on
her
forehead
scoutbush
enters
is
introduced
and
receives
a
salutation
from
the
actress
haughty
and
cold
enough
to
check
the
forwardest
puts
on
the
air
of
languid
nonchalance
which
is
considered
or
was
before
the
little
experiences
of
the
crimea
fit
and
proper
for
young
gentlemen
of
rank
and
fashion
so
he
sits
down
and
feasts
his
foolish
eyes
upon
his
idol
hoping
for
a
few
words
before
the
evening
is
over
did
i
not
say
well
then
that
there
was
as
much
meekness
and
humility
under
scoutbush
white
cravat
as
under
others
but
his
little
joy
is
soon
dashed
for
the
black
boy
announces
seemingly
much
to
his
own
pleasure
a
tall
personage
whom
from
his
dress
and
his
moustachio
scoutbush
takes
for
a
frenchman
till
he
hears
him
called
stangrave
the
intruder
is
introduced
to
lord
scoutbush
which
ceremony
is
consummated
by
a
microscopic
nod
on
either
side
he
then
walks
straight
up
to
la
cordifiamma
and
scoutbush
sees
her
cheeks
flush
as
he
does
so
he
takes
her
hand
speaks
to
her
in
a
low
voice
and
sits
down
by
her
claude
making
room
for
him
and
the
two
engage
earnestly
in
conversation
scoutbush
is
much
inclined
to
walk
out
of
the
room
was
he
brought
there
to
see
that
of
course
however
he
sits
still
keeps
his
own
counsel
and
makes
himself
agreeable
enough
all
the
evening
like
a
little
man
as
he
is
whereby
he
is
repaid
for
the
conversation
soon
becomes
deep
and
even
too
deep
for
him
and
he
is
fain
to
drop
out
of
the
race
and
leave
it
to
his
idol
and
to
the
who
seems
to
have
seen
and
done
and
read
everything
in
heaven
and
earth
and
probably
bought
everything
also
not
to
mention
that
he
would
be
happy
to
sell
the
said
universe
again
at
a
very
cheap
price
if
any
one
would
kindly
take
it
off
his
hands
not
that
he
boasts
or
takes
any
undue
share
of
the
conversation
he
is
evidently
too
well
bred
for
that
but
every
sentence
shows
an
acquaintance
with
facts
of
which
eton
has
told
scoutbush
nothing
the
less
and
after
which
he
still
craves
the
good
little
fellow
in
a
very
honest
way
and
would
soon
have
learnt
had
he
had
a
chance
for
of
native
irish
smartness
he
had
no
lack
poor
flake
was
half
mad
about
you
signora
in
the
said
sabina
he
says
that
he
shall
not
sleep
till
he
has
painted
you
do
let
him
cried
scoutbush
what
a
picture
he
will
make
he
may
paint
a
picture
but
not
me
it
is
quite
enough
lord
scoutbush
to
be
some
one
else
for
two
hours
every
night
without
going
down
to
posterity
as
some
one
else
for
ever
if
i
am
painted
i
will
be
painted
by
no
one
who
can
not
represent
my
very
self
you
are
right
said
stangrave
and
you
will
do
the
man
himself
good
by
refusing
he
has
some
notion
still
of
what
a
portrait
ought
to
be
if
he
once
begins
by
attempting
passing
expressions
of
passion
which
is
all
stage
portraits
can
give
he
will
find
them
so
much
easier
than
honest
representations
of
character
that
he
will
end
where
all
our
moderns
seem
to
do
in
merest
melodrama
explain
said
she
portrait
painters
now
depend
for
their
effect
on
the
mere
accidents
of
the
on
dress
on
landscape
even
on
broad
hints
of
a
man
occupation
putting
a
plan
on
the
engineer
table
and
a
roll
in
the
statesman
hands
like
the
old
greek
who
wrote
is
an
under
his
picture
if
they
wish
to
give
the
face
expression
though
they
seldom
aim
so
high
all
they
can
compass
is
a
passing
emotion
and
one
sitter
goes
down
to
posterity
with
an
eternal
frown
another
with
an
eternal
smile
or
if
he
be
a
poet
said
sabina
rolls
his
eye
for
ever
in
a
fine
frenzy
but
would
you
forbid
them
to
paint
passion
not
in
its
place
when
the
picture
gives
the
causes
of
the
passion
and
the
scene
tells
its
own
story
but
then
let
us
not
have
merely
kean
as
hamlet
but
hamlet
self
let
the
painter
sit
down
and
conceive
for
himself
a
hamlet
such
as
shakspeare
conceived
not
merely
give
us
as
much
of
him
as
could
be
pressed
at
a
given
moment
into
the
face
of
kean
he
will
be
only
unjust
to
both
actor
and
character
if
flake
paints
marie
as
lady
macbeth
he
will
give
us
neither
her
nor
lady
macbeth
but
only
the
single
point
at
which
their
two
characters
can
coincide
how
rude
said
sabina
laughing
what
is
he
doing
but
hinting
that
la
signora
conception
of
lady
macbeth
is
a
very
partial
and
imperfect
one
and
why
should
it
not
be
asked
the
actress
humbly
enough
i
meant
he
answered
warmly
that
there
was
more
far
more
in
her
than
in
any
character
which
she
assumes
and
i
do
not
want
a
painter
to
copy
only
one
aspect
and
let
a
part
go
down
to
posterity
as
a
representation
of
the
whole
if
you
mean
that
you
shall
be
forgiven
no
when
she
is
painted
she
shall
be
painted
as
herself
as
she
is
now
claude
shall
paint
her
i
have
not
known
la
signora
long
enough
said
claude
to
aspire
to
such
an
honour
i
paint
no
face
which
i
have
not
studied
for
a
year
faith
said
scoutbush
you
would
find
no
more
in
most
faces
at
the
year
end
than
you
did
the
first
day
then
i
would
not
paint
them
if
i
paint
a
portrait
which
i
seldom
do
i
wish
to
make
it
such
a
one
as
the
old
masters
aimed
at
to
give
the
sum
total
of
the
whole
character
traces
of
every
emotion
if
it
were
possible
and
glances
of
every
expression
which
have
passed
over
it
since
it
was
born
into
the
world
they
are
all
here
the
whole
past
and
future
of
the
man
and
every
man
as
the
mohammedans
say
carries
his
destiny
on
his
forehead
but
who
has
eyes
to
see
it
the
old
masters
had
some
of
them
at
least
raphael
had
sebastian
del
piombo
had
and
titian
and
giorgione
there
are
portraits
painted
by
them
which
carry
a
whole
concentrated
into
one
moment
but
they
said
stangrave
are
the
portraits
of
men
such
as
they
saw
around
them
natures
who
were
strong
for
good
and
evil
who
were
not
ashamed
to
show
their
strength
where
will
a
painter
find
such
among
the
poor
thin
unable
mortals
who
come
to
him
to
buy
immortality
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
guineas
apiece
after
having
spent
their
lives
in
religiously
rubbing
off
their
angles
against
each
other
and
forming
their
characters
as
you
form
shot
by
shaking
them
together
in
a
bag
till
they
have
polished
each
other
into
dullest
uniformity
it
very
true
said
scoutbush
who
suffered
much
at
times
from
a
certain
wild
irish
vein
which
stirred
him
up
to
kick
over
the
traces
people
are
horribly
like
each
other
and
if
a
poor
fellow
is
bored
and
tries
to
do
anything
spicy
or
original
he
has
people
him
down
on
the
score
of
bad
taste
men
can
be
just
as
original
now
as
ever
said
la
signora
if
they
had
but
the
courage
even
the
insight
heroic
souls
in
old
times
had
no
more
opportunities
than
we
have
but
they
used
them
there
were
daring
deeds
to
be
done
then
are
there
none
now
sacrifices
to
be
made
are
there
none
now
wrongs
to
be
redressed
are
there
none
now
let
any
one
set
his
heart
in
these
days
to
do
what
is
right
and
nothing
else
and
it
will
not
be
long
ere
his
brow
is
stamped
with
all
that
goes
to
make
up
the
heroical
expression
with
noble
indignation
noble
great
hopes
great
sorrows
perhaps
even
with
the
print
of
the
martyr
crown
of
thorns
she
looked
at
stangrave
as
she
spoke
with
an
expression
which
scoutbush
tried
in
vain
to
read
the
american
made
no
answer
and
seemed
to
hang
his
head
awhile
after
a
minute
he
said
tenderly
you
will
tire
yourself
if
you
talk
thus
after
the
evening
fatigue
mellot
will
sing
to
us
and
give
us
leisure
to
think
over
our
lesson
and
sabina
sang
and
then
lord
scoutbush
was
made
to
sing
and
sang
his
best
no
doubt
so
the
evening
slipt
on
till
it
was
past
eleven
and
stangrave
rose
and
now
said
he
i
must
go
to
lady
m
ball
and
marie
must
rest
as
he
went
he
just
leaned
over
la
cordifiamma
shall
i
come
in
morning
we
ought
to
read
over
that
scene
together
before
the
rehearsal
early
then
or
sabina
will
be
gone
out
and
she
must
play
soubrette
to
our
hero
and
heroine
you
will
rest
mellot
you
will
see
that
she
does
not
sit
up
it
is
not
very
polite
to
rob
us
of
her
as
soon
as
you
can
not
enjoy
her
yourself
i
must
take
care
of
people
who
do
not
take
care
of
themselves
and
stangrave
departed
great
was
scoutbush
wrath
when
he
saw
marie
rise
and
obey
orders
who
was
this
man
what
right
had
he
to
command
her
he
asked
as
much
of
sabina
the
moment
la
cordifiamma
had
retired
are
you
not
going
to
lady
m
too
no
that
is
i
wo
go
yet
not
till
you
have
explained
all
this
to
me
explained
what
asked
sabina
looking
as
demure
as
a
little
brown
mouse
why
what
did
you
ask
me
here
for
lord
scoutbush
should
recollect
that
he
asked
himself
you
cruel
venomous
creature
do
you
think
i
would
have
come
if
i
had
known
that
i
was
to
see
another
man
making
love
to
her
before
my
very
eyes
i
could
kill
the
fellow
who
is
he
a
new
york
merchant
unworthy
of
your
aristocratic
powder
and
ball
the
confounded
yankee
muttered
scoutbush
if
people
swear
in
my
house
i
fine
them
a
dozen
of
kid
gloves
did
you
not
promise
me
that
you
would
not
make
love
to
her
yourself
well
but
it
is
too
cruel
of
you
before
my
very
eyes
i
saw
no
none
were
you
blind
not
in
the
least
but
you
can
not
well
see
a
thing
making
which
has
been
made
long
ago
what
is
he
her
husband
no
engaged
to
her
no
what
then
do
you
know
already
that
this
is
a
house
of
mystery
full
of
mysterious
people
i
tell
you
this
only
that
if
she
ever
marries
any
one
she
will
marry
him
and
that
if
i
can
i
will
make
her
then
you
are
my
enemy
after
all
i
do
you
think
that
sabina
mellot
can
see
a
young
viscount
loose
upon
the
universe
without
trying
to
make
up
a
match
for
him
no
i
have
such
a
prize
for
you
young
handsome
better
educated
than
any
woman
whom
you
will
meet
true
she
is
a
manchester
girl
but
then
she
has
eighty
thousand
pounds
eighty
thousand
nonsense
i
sooner
have
that
divine
creature
without
a
penny
than
and
would
my
lord
viscount
so
far
debase
himself
as
to
marry
an
actress
humph
faith
my
grandmother
was
an
actress
and
we
justs
are
none
the
worse
for
that
fact
as
far
as
i
can
see
and
certainly
none
the
uglier
the
women
at
least
oh
sabina
mellot
i
mean
only
help
me
this
once
this
once
do
you
intend
to
marry
by
my
assistance
this
time
and
by
your
own
the
next
how
many
viscountesses
are
there
to
be
do
laugh
at
me
you
cruel
woman
you
do
know
you
fancy
that
i
am
not
in
love
and
the
poor
fellow
began
pouring
out
these
commonplaces
which
one
has
heard
too
often
to
take
the
trouble
of
repeating
and
yet
which
are
real
enough
and
pathetic
too
for
in
every
man
however
frivolous
or
even
worthless
love
calls
up
to
the
surface
the
real
heroism
the
real
depth
of
character
all
the
more
deep
because
common
to
poet
and
philosopher
guardsman
and
country
clod
i
leave
town
i
go
to
the
to
norway
to
africa
and
forget
her
in
the
bliss
of
do
i
tell
you
here
i
will
not
stay
to
be
driven
mad
to
think
that
she
is
here
and
that
hateful
yankee
at
her
elbow
i
go
to
lady
m
ball
no
confound
it
to
meet
that
fellow
there
i
should
quarrel
with
him
as
sure
as
there
is
hot
irish
blood
in
my
veins
the
puppy
to
be
flirting
and
strutting
there
while
such
a
creature
as
that
is
lying
thinking
of
him
would
you
have
him
shut
himself
up
in
his
hotel
and
write
poetry
or
walk
the
streets
all
night
sighing
at
the
moon
no
but
the
cool
way
in
which
he
went
off
himself
and
sent
her
to
bed
confound
him
commanding
her
it
made
my
blood
boil
claude
get
lord
scoutbush
some
iced
if
you
laugh
at
me
i
never
speak
to
you
again
or
buy
any
of
claude
pictures
why
do
you
torment
me
so
i
go
i
say
leave
town
only
i
ca
with
this
horrid
depot
work
what
shall
i
do
it
too
cruel
of
you
while
campbell
is
away
in
ireland
too
and
i
have
not
a
soul
but
you
to
ask
advice
of
for
valencia
is
as
great
a
goose
as
i
am
and
the
poor
little
fellow
buried
his
hands
in
his
curls
and
stared
fiercely
into
the
fire
as
if
to
draw
from
thence
omens
of
his
love
by
the
spodomantic
augury
of
the
ancient
greeks
while
sabina
tripped
up
and
down
the
room
putting
things
to
rights
for
the
night
and
enjoying
his
torments
as
a
cat
does
those
of
the
mouse
between
her
paws
and
yet
not
out
of
spite
but
from
pure
and
simple
fun
sabina
is
one
of
those
charming
bodies
who
knows
everybody
business
and
manages
it
she
lives
in
a
world
of
intrigue
but
without
a
thought
of
intriguing
for
her
own
benefit
she
has
always
a
match
to
make
a
disconsolate
lover
to
comfort
a
young
artist
to
bring
forward
a
refugee
to
conceal
a
spendthrift
to
get
out
of
a
scrape
and
like
david
in
the
mountains
every
one
that
is
discontented
and
every
one
that
is
in
debt
gather
themselves
to
her
the
strangest
people
on
the
strangest
errands
run
over
each
other
in
that
cosy
little
nest
of
hers
fine
ladies
with
hearts
and
seedy
gentlemen
with
pockets
jostle
each
other
at
her
door
and
she
has
a
smile
and
a
repartee
and
good
cunning
practical
wisdom
for
each
and
every
one
of
them
and
then
dismisses
them
to
bill
and
coo
with
claude
and
laugh
over
everybody
and
everything
the
only
price
which
she
demands
for
her
services
is
to
be
allowed
to
laugh
and
if
that
be
permitted
she
will
be
as
busy
and
earnest
and
tender
as
saint
elizabeth
herself
i
have
no
children
of
my
own
she
says
so
i
just
make
everybody
my
children
claude
included
and
play
with
them
and
laugh
at
them
and
pet
them
and
help
them
out
of
their
scrapes
just
as
i
should
if
they
were
in
my
own
nursery
and
so
it
befalls
that
she
is
every
one
confidant
and
though
every
one
seems
on
the
point
of
taking
liberties
with
her
yet
no
one
does
partly
because
they
are
in
her
power
and
partly
because
like
an
eastern
sultana
she
carries
a
poniard
and
can
use
it
though
only
in
so
if
great
people
or
small
people
either
who
can
give
themselves
airs
as
well
as
their
betters
take
her
plain
speaking
unkindly
she
just
speaks
a
little
more
plainly
once
for
all
and
goes
off
smiling
to
some
one
else
as
a
hummingbird
if
a
flower
has
no
honey
in
it
whirs
away
with
a
saucy
flirt
of
its
pretty
little
tail
to
the
next
branch
on
the
bush
i
must
know
more
of
this
american
said
scoutbush
at
last
well
he
would
be
very
improving
company
for
you
and
i
know
you
like
improving
company
i
mean
what
has
he
to
do
with
her
that
is
just
what
i
will
not
tell
you
one
thing
i
will
tell
you
though
for
it
may
help
to
quench
any
vain
hopes
on
your
part
and
that
is
the
reason
which
she
gives
for
not
marrying
him
well
because
he
is
an
idler
what
would
she
say
of
me
then
groaned
scoutbush
very
true
for
you
must
understand
this
stangrave
is
not
what
you
or
i
should
call
an
idle
man
he
has
travelled
over
half
the
world
and
made
the
best
use
of
his
eyes
he
has
filled
his
house
in
new
york
they
say
with
gems
of
art
gathered
from
every
country
in
europe
he
is
a
finished
scholar
talks
different
languages
sings
draws
writes
poetry
reads
hard
every
day
at
every
subject
from
gardening
to
german
metaphysics
altogether
one
of
the
most
highly
cultivated
men
i
know
and
quite
an
admirable
crichton
in
his
way
then
why
does
she
call
him
an
idler
because
she
says
he
has
no
great
purpose
in
life
she
will
marry
no
one
who
will
not
devote
himself
and
all
he
has
to
some
great
chivalrous
heroic
enterprise
whose
one
object
is
to
be
of
use
even
if
he
has
to
sacrifice
his
life
to
it
she
says
that
there
must
be
such
men
still
left
in
the
world
and
that
if
she
finds
one
him
she
will
marry
and
no
one
else
why
there
are
none
such
to
be
found
i
thought
you
heard
what
she
herself
said
on
that
very
point
there
was
a
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
had
heard
and
was
pondering
it
in
his
heart
at
last
i
am
not
cut
out
for
a
hero
so
i
suppose
i
must
give
her
up
but
i
wish
sometimes
i
could
be
of
use
mellot
but
what
can
a
fellow
do
i
thought
there
was
an
irish
tenantry
to
be
looked
after
my
lord
and
a
cornish
tenantry
too
that
what
campbell
is
always
saying
but
what
more
can
i
do
than
i
do
as
for
those
poor
paddies
i
never
ask
them
for
rent
if
i
did
i
should
not
get
it
so
there
is
no
generosity
in
that
and
as
for
the
aberalva
people
they
have
got
on
very
well
without
me
for
twenty
years
and
i
do
know
them
nor
what
they
want
nor
even
if
they
do
want
anything
except
fish
enough
and
i
ca
put
more
fish
into
the
sea
mrs
mellot
try
and
be
a
good
soldier
then
said
she
laughing
why
should
not
lord
scoutbush
emulate
his
illustrious
countryman
conquer
at
a
second
waterloo
and
die
a
duke
i
not
cut
out
for
a
general
i
am
afraid
but
if
i
do
say
if
i
could
marry
that
woman
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
foolish
thing
though
i
shall
break
my
heart
i
believe
if
i
do
not
oh
mellot
you
can
not
tell
what
a
fool
i
have
made
myself
about
her
and
i
can
not
help
it
it
not
her
beauty
merely
but
there
is
something
so
noble
in
her
face
like
one
of
those
greek
goddesses
claude
talks
of
and
when
she
is
acting
if
she
has
to
say
anything
grand
or
generous
or
you
know
the
sort
of
thing
she
brings
it
out
with
such
a
voice
and
such
a
look
from
the
very
bottom
of
her
heart
it
makes
me
shudder
just
as
she
did
when
she
told
that
yankee
that
every
one
could
be
a
hero
or
a
martyr
if
he
chose
mellot
i
am
sure
she
is
one
or
she
could
not
look
and
speak
as
she
does
she
is
one
said
sabina
a
heroine
and
a
martyr
too
if
i
could
that
was
what
i
was
going
to
say
if
i
could
but
win
that
woman
respect
as
i
live
i
ask
no
more
only
to
be
sure
she
did
despise
me
i
do
i
do
know
what
i
would
do
i
study
the
art
of
war
i
know
there
are
books
about
it
i
get
out
to
the
east
away
from
this
depôt
work
and
if
there
is
no
fighting
there
as
every
one
says
there
will
not
be
i
go
into
a
marching
regiment
and
see
service
i
hang
it
if
they
have
me
i
even
go
to
the
senior
department
at
sandhurst
and
read
mathematics
sabina
kept
her
countenance
though
with
difficulty
at
this
magnificent
bathos
for
she
saw
that
the
little
man
was
really
in
earnest
and
that
the
looks
and
words
of
the
strange
actress
had
awakened
in
him
something
far
deeper
and
nobler
than
the
mere
sensual
passion
of
a
boy
ah
if
i
had
but
gone
out
to
varna
with
the
rest
i
thought
myself
a
lucky
fellow
to
be
left
here
do
you
know
that
it
is
getting
very
late
so
frederick
lord
scoutbush
went
home
to
his
rooms
and
there
sat
for
three
hours
and
more
with
his
feet
on
the
fender
rejecting
the
entreaties
of
bowie
his
servant
either
to
have
something
or
to
go
to
bed
yea
he
forgot
even
to
smoke
by
which
bowie
jaloused
that
he
was
hit
very
hard
indeed
but
made
no
remark
being
a
scotchman
and
of
a
cautious
temperament
however
from
that
night
scoutbush
was
a
changed
man
and
tried
to
be
so
he
read
of
nothing
but
sieges
and
stockades
brigade
evolutions
and
conical
bullets
he
drilled
his
men
till
he
was
an
abomination
in
their
eyes
and
a
weariness
to
their
flesh
only
every
evening
he
went
to
the
theatre
watched
la
cordifiamma
with
a
heavy
heart
and
then
went
home
to
bed
for
the
little
man
had
good
sense
enough
to
ask
sabina
for
no
more
interviews
with
her
so
in
all
things
he
acquitted
himself
as
a
model
officer
and
excited
the
admiration
and
respect
of
serjeant
major
macarthur
who
began
fishing
at
bowie
to
discover
the
cause
of
this
strange
metamorphosis
in
the
rackety
little
irishman
your
master
seems
to
be
qualifying
himself
for
the
adjutant
post
bowie
i
jalousing
he
fired
with
martial
ardour
since
the
war
broke
out
to
which
bowie
being
a
brother
scot
answered
scotticè
by
a
crafty
paralogism
i
always
held
it
as
my
opeeeenion
that
his
lordship
is
a
youth
of
very
good
parts
if
he
was
only
compelled
to
employ
them
chapter
viii
taking
root
whosoever
enjoys
the
sight
of
an
honest
man
doing
his
work
well
would
have
enjoyed
the
sight
of
tom
thurnall
for
the
next
two
months
all
the
morning
and
out
of
doors
all
the
afternoon
was
that
shrewd
and
visage
calling
up
an
answering
smile
on
every
face
and
leaving
every
heart
a
little
lighter
than
he
found
it
puzzling
enough
it
was
alike
to
heale
and
to
headley
how
tom
contrived
as
if
by
magic
to
gain
every
one
good
word
their
own
included
for
frank
in
spite
of
tom
questionable
opinions
had
already
made
all
but
a
confidant
of
the
doctor
and
heale
in
spite
of
envy
and
suspicion
could
not
deny
that
the
young
man
was
a
very
valuable
young
man
if
he
was
given
so
much
to
those
notions
of
the
profession
by
which
term
heale
indicated
the
to
him
astounding
fact
that
tom
charged
the
patients
as
little
instead
of
as
much
as
possible
and
applying
to
medicine
the
principles
of
an
enlightened
political
economy
tried
to
increase
the
demand
by
cheapening
the
supply
which
is
revolutionary
doctrine
sir
said
heale
to
lieutenant
jones
over
the
and
just
like
what
the
cobden
and
bright
lot
used
to
talk
and
have
been
the
ruin
of
british
agriculture
though
do
say
i
said
so
because
of
my
lord
minchampstead
but
conceive
my
feelings
sir
as
the
father
of
a
family
who
have
my
bread
to
earn
this
very
in
comes
old
dame
penaluna
which
is
good
pay
i
know
and
has
two
hundred
and
more
out
on
a
merchant
brig
for
something
and
what
was
my
feelings
sir
to
hear
this
young
party
deliver
himself
says
he
as
i
am
a
living
man
can
cure
you
if
you
like
with
a
dozen
bottles
of
lotion
at
eighteenpence
but
if
you
take
my
advice
buy
two
pennyworth
of
alum
down
street
do
what
i
tell
you
with
it
and
cure
yourself
it
robbery
sir
i
say
all
these
cheap
dodges
which
ar
in
the
pharmacopoeia
half
of
them
unprofessional
sir
quackery
tell
you
what
doctor
robbery
or
none
i
go
to
him
d
see
if
i
live
as
long
for
this
old
ailment
of
mine
i
never
told
you
of
it
old
pill
and
potion
for
fear
of
a
swinging
bill
but
just
grinned
and
bore
it
d
see
there
it
is
again
cries
heale
in
despair
he
ruin
me
no
he
wo
and
you
know
it
what
d
think
he
served
me
last
week
a
young
chap
comes
in
consumptive
he
said
and
i
dare
say
he
right
he
is
uncommonly
about
what
he
calls
diagnosis
says
he
ought
to
try
carrageen
moss
it
an
old
drug
but
it
a
good
one
there
was
a
drawer
full
of
it
to
his
hand
had
been
lying
there
any
time
this
ten
years
i
go
to
open
it
but
what
was
my
feelings
when
he
goes
on
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
there
bushels
of
it
here
says
he
every
rock
so
if
you
come
down
with
me
at
low
tide
this
afternoon
i
show
you
the
trade
and
tell
you
how
to
boil
it
i
thought
i
should
have
knocked
him
down
but
you
did
said
jones
laughing
in
every
muscle
of
his
body
tell
you
what
doctor
you
got
a
treasure
he
just
getting
back
your
custom
d
see
and
when
he
done
that
he
lay
on
the
bills
sharp
enough
why
i
hear
he
up
at
vavasour
every
day
and
not
ten
shillings
worth
of
medicine
sent
up
to
the
house
any
week
he
charges
for
his
visits
i
suppose
not
he
if
you
believe
me
when
i
asked
him
if
he
was
going
to
he
says
says
he
that
vavasour
company
was
quite
payment
enough
for
him
shows
his
good
taste
why
what
now
mary
as
the
maid
opens
the
door
thurnall
wants
mr
heale
always
wanting
me
groans
heale
hugging
his
glass
driving
me
about
like
any
negro
slave
tell
him
to
come
in
here
doctor
says
the
lieutenant
i
want
you
to
prescribe
for
me
if
you
do
it
gratis
d
see
take
some
brandy
and
water
good
advice
costs
nothing
says
tom
filling
heale
read
that
letter
and
the
lieutenant
details
his
ailments
and
their
supposed
cause
till
heale
has
the
pleasure
of
hearing
tom
answer
fiddlesticks
that
not
what
the
matter
with
you
i
cure
you
for
and
toss
you
up
double
or
quits
oh
groans
heale
as
he
spells
away
over
the
letter
lord
minchampstead
having
been
informed
by
armsworth
that
thurnall
is
now
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
estates
of
pentremochyn
would
feel
obliged
to
him
at
his
earliest
convenience
to
examine
into
the
sanitary
state
of
the
cottages
thereon
which
are
said
to
be
much
haunted
by
typhus
and
other
epidemics
and
to
send
him
a
detailed
report
indicating
what
he
thinks
necessary
for
making
them
thoroughly
healthy
thurnall
will
be
so
good
as
to
make
his
own
charge
well
thurnall
you
ought
to
turn
a
good
penny
by
this
said
heale
half
envious
of
tom
connection
half
contemptuous
at
his
supposed
indifference
to
gain
i
charge
what
it
worth
said
tom
meanwhile
i
hope
going
to
see
miss
beer
could
you
just
go
yourself
my
dear
sir
it
is
so
late
no
i
never
go
near
young
women
i
told
you
so
at
first
and
i
stick
to
my
rule
you
better
go
sir
on
my
word
or
if
she
dead
before
morning
do
say
it
my
fault
did
you
ever
hear
a
poor
old
man
so
tyrannised
over
said
heale
as
tom
coolly
went
into
the
passage
brought
in
the
old
man
great
coat
and
hat
arrayed
him
and
marched
him
out
civilly
but
firmly
now
lieutenant
i
half
an
hour
to
spare
let
have
a
jolly
chat
about
the
west
indies
and
tom
began
with
anecdote
and
joke
and
the
old
seaman
laughed
till
he
cried
and
went
to
bed
vowing
that
there
never
was
such
a
pleasant
fellow
on
earth
and
he
ought
to
be
physician
to
queen
victoria
up
at
five
the
next
morning
the
indefatigable
tom
had
all
his
work
done
by
ten
and
was
preparing
to
start
for
pentremochyn
ere
heale
was
out
of
bed
when
a
customer
came
in
who
kept
him
half
an
hour
he
was
a
tall
young
man
with
a
red
face
protruding
bull
eyes
and
a
moustachio
he
was
dressed
in
a
complete
suit
of
pink
and
white
plaid
cut
jauntily
enough
a
bright
blue
cap
a
thick
gold
three
or
four
large
rings
a
from
his
a
fancy
cane
in
his
hand
and
a
little
oxford
meerschaum
in
his
mouth
completed
his
equipment
he
lounged
in
with
an
air
of
careless
superiority
while
tom
who
was
behind
the
counter
cutting
up
his
day
provision
of
eyed
him
curiously
who
are
you
now
a
gentleman
not
quite
i
guess
some
squireen
of
the
parts
adjacent
and
look
in
somewhat
of
a
crapulocomatose
state
moreover
i
wonder
if
you
are
the
great
trebooze
of
trebooze
i
say
yawned
the
young
gentleman
where
old
heale
and
an
oath
followed
the
speech
as
it
did
every
other
one
herein
recorded
the
playing
half
of
old
heale
is
in
bed
and
i
his
working
half
can
i
do
anything
for
you
cool
fish
thought
the
customer
i
say
what
have
you
got
there
australian
did
you
ever
smoke
it
i
heard
of
it
let
see
and
trebooze
for
it
was
he
put
his
hand
across
the
counter
unceremoniously
and
clawed
up
some
did
know
you
sold
tobacco
here
prime
stuff
too
strong
for
me
though
this
morning
somehow
ah
a
little
too
much
claret
last
night
i
thought
so
we
set
that
right
in
five
minutes
eh
how
did
you
guess
that
asked
trebooze
with
a
larger
oath
than
usual
oh
we
doctors
are
men
of
the
world
said
tom
in
a
cheerful
and
insinuating
tone
as
he
mixed
his
man
a
draught
you
doctors
you
a
cock
of
a
different
hackle
from
old
heale
then
i
trust
so
said
tom
by
george
i
feel
better
already
i
say
you
a
trump
i
suppose
you
heale
new
partner
the
man
who
was
washed
ashore
tom
nodded
assent
i
say
how
do
you
sell
that
i
do
sell
it
i
give
you
as
much
as
you
like
only
you
smoke
it
till
after
dinner
sha
said
trebooze
testy
and
proud
not
with
my
leave
or
you
be
complaining
two
hours
hence
that
i
am
a
humbug
and
have
done
you
no
good
get
on
your
horse
and
have
four
hours
gallop
on
the
downs
and
you
feel
like
a
buffalo
bull
by
two
trebooze
looked
at
him
with
a
stupid
curiosity
and
a
little
awe
he
saw
that
tom
cool
was
not
meant
for
impudence
and
something
in
his
tone
and
manner
told
him
that
the
boast
of
being
a
man
of
the
world
was
not
untrue
and
of
all
kinds
of
men
a
man
of
the
world
was
the
man
of
whom
trebooze
stood
most
in
awe
a
small
squireen
cursed
with
six
or
seven
hundreds
a
year
of
his
own
never
sent
to
school
college
or
into
the
army
he
had
grown
up
in
a
narrow
circle
of
squireens
like
himself
without
an
object
save
that
of
gratifying
his
animal
passions
and
had
about
six
years
before
being
then
just
of
age
settled
in
life
by
marrying
his
housemaid
the
only
wise
thing
perhaps
he
ever
did
for
she
a
clever
and
determined
woman
kept
him
though
not
from
drunkenness
and
debt
at
least
from
delirium
tremens
and
ruin
and
was
in
her
rough
vulgar
way
his
guardian
angel
such
a
one
at
least
as
he
was
worthy
of
more
than
once
has
one
seen
the
same
seeming
folly
turn
out
in
practice
as
wise
a
step
as
could
well
have
been
taken
and
the
coarse
nature
of
the
man
which
would
have
crushed
and
a
delicate
and
wife
subdued
to
something
like
decency
by
a
help
literally
meet
for
it
there
was
a
pause
trebooze
fancied
and
wisely
that
the
doctor
was
a
cleverer
man
than
he
and
of
course
would
want
to
show
it
so
after
the
fashion
of
a
country
squireen
he
felt
a
longing
to
set
him
down
he
been
a
traveller
they
say
thought
he
in
that
pugnacious
sceptical
spirit
which
is
bred
not
as
twaddlers
fancy
by
too
extended
knowledge
but
by
the
sense
of
ignorance
and
a
narrow
sphere
of
thought
which
makes
a
man
angry
and
envious
of
any
one
who
has
seen
more
than
he
buffalo
bulls
said
he
half
contemptuously
what
do
you
know
about
buffalo
bulls
i
was
one
once
myself
said
tom
where
i
lived
before
trebooze
swore
do
you
put
your
traveller
lies
on
me
sir
well
perhaps
i
dreamt
it
said
tom
placidly
i
remember
i
dreamt
at
the
same
time
that
you
were
a
grizzly
bear
fourteen
feet
long
and
wanted
to
eat
me
up
but
you
found
me
too
tough
about
the
hump
ribs
trebooze
stared
at
his
audacity
you
a
rum
hand
to
which
tom
made
answer
in
the
same
elegant
strain
and
then
began
a
regular
of
slang
in
which
tom
showed
himself
so
really
witty
a
proficient
that
trebooze
laughed
himself
into
and
ended
by
i
say
you
a
good
fellow
and
i
think
you
and
i
shall
suit
tom
had
his
doubts
but
did
not
express
them
come
up
this
afternoon
and
see
my
child
trebooze
thinks
got
swelled
glands
or
some
such
woman
nonsense
bother
them
why
ca
they
let
the
child
alone
fussing
and
doctoring
and
she
will
have
you
heard
of
you
from
vavasour
i
believe
our
doctor
and
i
have
quarrelled
and
she
said
if
i
could
get
you
she
sooner
have
you
than
that
old
heale
and
then
you
better
stop
and
take
and
we
make
a
night
of
it
i
have
to
go
round
lord
minchampstead
estates
and
will
take
you
on
my
way
but
i
afraid
i
shall
be
too
dirty
to
have
the
pleasure
of
dining
with
trebooze
coming
back
trebooze
she
must
take
what
i
like
and
what
good
enough
for
me
is
good
enough
for
her
i
hope
come
as
you
are
liberty
hall
at
trebooze
and
out
he
swaggered
does
he
bully
her
thought
tom
or
is
he
and
wants
to
hide
it
i
see
and
play
my
cards
accordingly
all
which
miss
heale
had
heard
she
had
been
peeping
and
listening
at
the
and
her
mother
also
for
no
sooner
had
trebooze
entered
the
shop
than
she
had
run
off
to
tell
her
mother
the
surprising
fact
trebooze
custom
having
been
for
some
years
past
courted
in
vain
by
heale
so
miss
heale
peeped
and
peeped
at
a
man
whom
she
regarded
with
delighted
curiosity
because
he
bore
the
reputation
of
being
such
a
naughty
wicked
man
and
so
very
handsome
too
and
so
distinguished
as
he
looks
said
the
poor
little
fool
to
whose
imagination
trebooze
was
an
ideal
lothario
but
the
surprise
of
the
two
dames
grew
rapidly
as
they
heard
audacity
towards
the
country
aristocrat
impudent
wretch
moaned
heale
to
herself
he
drive
away
an
angel
if
he
came
into
the
shop
oh
ma
hear
how
they
are
going
on
now
i
ca
bear
it
my
dear
this
man
will
be
the
ruin
of
us
his
manners
are
those
of
the
when
the
cloven
foot
is
shown
which
it
his
nature
as
a
child
of
wrath
and
we
ca
expect
otherwise
oh
ma
do
you
hear
that
trebooze
has
asked
him
to
dinner
nonsense
but
it
was
true
well
if
there
ai
the
signs
of
the
end
of
the
world
which
is
all
the
years
your
poor
father
has
been
here
and
never
so
much
as
send
him
a
hare
and
now
this
young
penniless
interloper
and
he
to
dine
at
trebooze
off
purple
and
fine
linen
there
is
not
much
of
that
there
ma
i
sure
they
are
poor
enough
for
all
his
pride
and
as
for
her
yes
my
dear
and
as
for
her
though
we
have
married
squires
my
dear
yet
we
have
been
squires
housemaids
and
have
adorned
our
own
station
which
was
good
enough
for
us
and
has
no
need
to
rise
out
of
it
nor
ride
on
pharaoh
after
filthy
lucre
miss
heale
hated
poor
trebooze
with
a
bitter
hatred
because
she
dreamed
insanely
that
but
for
her
she
might
have
secured
trebooze
for
herself
and
though
her
ambition
was
now
transferred
to
the
unconscious
tom
that
need
not
make
any
difference
in
the
said
amiable
feeling
but
that
tom
was
a
most
wonderful
person
she
had
no
doubt
he
had
conquered
her
heart
so
she
informed
herself
passionately
again
and
again
as
was
very
necessary
seeing
that
the
passion
having
no
real
life
of
its
own
required
a
good
deal
of
blowing
to
keep
it
alight
yes
he
had
conquered
her
heart
and
he
was
conquering
all
hearts
likewise
there
must
be
some
mystery
about
him
there
should
be
and
she
settled
in
her
brain
that
tom
must
be
a
nobleman
in
disguise
probably
a
foreign
prince
exiled
for
political
offences
bah
perhaps
too
many
lines
have
been
spent
on
the
poor
little
fool
but
as
such
fools
exist
and
people
must
be
as
they
are
there
is
no
harm
in
drawing
her
and
in
asking
too
who
will
help
those
young
girls
of
the
middle
class
who
like
miss
heale
are
often
really
less
educated
than
the
children
of
their
parents
workmen
sedentary
luxurious
full
of
petty
vanity
gossip
and
intrigue
without
work
without
purpose
except
that
of
getting
married
to
any
one
who
will
ask
them
bewildering
brain
and
heart
with
novels
which
after
all
one
hardly
grudges
them
for
what
other
means
have
they
of
learning
that
there
is
any
fairer
nobler
life
possible
at
least
on
earth
than
that
of
the
sordid
often
the
sordid
puffery
and
adulteration
which
is
the
atmosphere
of
their
home
exceptions
there
are
in
thousands
doubtless
and
the
families
of
the
great
city
tradesmen
stand
of
course
on
far
higher
ground
and
are
often
far
better
educated
and
more
than
the
fine
ladies
their
parents
customers
but
till
some
better
plan
of
education
than
the
is
devised
for
them
till
our
towns
shall
see
something
like
in
kind
to
though
sounder
and
soberer
in
quality
than
the
high
schools
of
america
till
in
country
villages
the
ladies
who
interest
themselves
about
the
poor
will
recollect
that
the
and
tradesmen
daughters
are
just
as
much
in
want
of
their
influence
as
the
charity
children
and
will
yield
a
far
richer
return
for
their
labour
though
the
one
need
not
interfere
with
the
other
so
long
will
england
be
full
of
miss
heales
fated
when
they
marry
to
bring
up
sons
and
daughters
as
sordid
and
unwholesome
as
their
mothers
tom
worked
all
that
day
in
and
out
of
the
pentremochyn
cottages
noting
down
nuisances
and
dilapidations
but
his
head
was
full
of
other
thoughts
for
he
had
received
the
evening
before
news
which
was
to
him
very
important
for
more
reasons
than
one
the
longer
he
stayed
at
aberalva
the
longer
he
felt
inclined
to
stay
the
strange
attraction
of
grace
had
as
we
have
seen
something
to
do
with
his
purpose
but
he
saw
too
a
good
opening
for
one
of
those
country
practices
in
which
he
seemed
more
and
more
likely
to
end
at
his
native
whitbury
he
knew
there
was
no
room
for
a
fresh
medical
man
and
gradually
he
was
making
up
his
mind
to
settle
at
aberalva
to
buy
out
heale
either
with
his
own
money
if
he
recovered
it
or
with
money
borrowed
from
mark
to
bring
his
father
down
to
live
with
him
and
in
that
pleasant
wild
western
place
fold
his
wings
after
all
his
wanderings
and
therefore
certain
news
which
he
had
obtained
the
night
before
was
very
valuable
to
him
in
that
it
put
a
fresh
person
into
his
power
and
might
if
cunningly
used
give
him
a
hold
upon
the
ruling
family
of
the
place
and
on
lord
scoutbush
himself
he
had
found
out
that
lucia
and
elsley
were
unhappy
together
and
found
out
too
a
little
more
than
was
there
to
find
he
could
not
of
course
be
a
month
among
the
gossips
of
aberalva
without
hearing
hints
that
the
great
folks
at
the
court
did
not
always
keep
their
tempers
for
of
family
jars
as
of
everything
else
on
earth
the
great
and
just
law
stands
true
what
you
do
in
the
closet
shall
be
proclaimed
on
the
housetop
but
the
gossips
of
aberalva
as
women
are
too
often
wont
to
do
had
altogether
taken
the
man
side
in
the
quarrel
the
reason
was
i
suppose
that
lucia
conscious
of
having
fallen
somewhat
in
rank
held
up
her
head
to
trebooze
and
heale
as
they
themselves
expressed
it
and
to
various
other
little
notabilities
of
the
neighbourhood
rather
more
than
she
would
have
done
had
she
married
a
man
of
her
own
class
she
was
afraid
that
they
might
boast
of
being
intimate
with
her
that
they
might
take
to
advising
and
patronising
her
as
an
inexperienced
young
creature
afraid
even
that
she
might
be
tempted
in
some
unguarded
moment
to
gossip
with
them
confide
her
unhappiness
to
them
in
the
blind
longing
to
open
her
heart
to
some
human
being
for
there
were
no
resident
gentry
of
her
own
rank
in
the
neighbourhood
she
was
too
to
complain
much
to
clara
and
her
sister
valencia
was
the
very
last
person
to
whom
she
would
confess
that
her
had
not
been
altogether
successful
so
she
lived
alone
and
friendless
shrinking
into
herself
more
and
more
while
the
vulgar
women
round
mistook
her
honour
for
pride
and
revenged
themselves
accordingly
she
was
an
uninteresting
fine
lady
proud
and
cross
and
elsley
was
a
martyr
so
handsome
and
agreeable
as
he
was
and
to
do
him
justice
he
was
the
former
and
he
could
be
the
latter
when
he
chose
to
be
tied
to
that
unsociable
woman
and
so
forth
all
which
tom
had
heard
and
formed
his
own
opinion
thereof
which
was
all
very
fine
but
i
flatter
myself
i
know
a
little
what
women
are
made
of
and
this
i
know
that
where
man
and
wife
quarrel
even
if
she
ends
the
battle
it
is
he
who
has
begun
it
i
never
saw
a
case
yet
where
the
man
was
not
the
most
in
fault
and
i
lay
my
life
john
briggs
has
led
her
a
pretty
life
what
else
could
one
expect
of
him
however
he
held
his
tongue
and
kept
his
eyes
open
withal
whenever
he
went
up
to
penalva
court
which
he
had
to
do
very
often
for
though
he
had
cured
the
children
of
their
ailments
yet
vavasour
was
perpetually
more
or
less
unwell
and
he
could
not
cure
her
her
low
spirits
headaches
general
want
of
tone
and
vitality
puzzled
him
at
first
and
would
have
puzzled
him
longer
had
he
not
settled
with
himself
that
their
cause
was
to
be
sought
in
the
mind
and
not
in
the
body
and
at
last
gaining
courage
from
certainty
he
had
hinted
as
much
to
miss
clara
the
night
before
when
she
came
down
as
she
was
very
fond
of
doing
to
have
a
gossip
with
him
in
his
shop
under
the
pretence
of
fetching
medicine
i
do
think
i
shall
send
vavasour
any
more
miss
clara
there
is
no
use
running
up
a
long
bill
when
i
do
no
good
and
what
is
more
suspect
that
i
can
do
none
poor
lady
and
he
gave
the
girl
a
look
which
seemed
to
say
you
had
better
tell
me
the
truth
for
i
know
everything
already
to
which
clara
answered
by
trying
to
find
out
how
much
he
did
know
but
tom
was
a
cunninger
diplomatist
than
she
and
in
ten
minutes
after
having
given
solemn
promises
of
secresy
and
having
by
strong
expressions
of
contempt
for
heale
and
the
village
gossips
made
clara
understand
that
he
did
not
at
all
take
their
view
of
the
case
he
had
poured
out
to
him
across
the
counter
all
clara
indignation
and
contempt
i
never
said
a
word
of
this
to
a
living
soul
sir
i
was
too
proud
for
my
mistress
sake
to
let
vulgar
people
know
what
we
suffered
we
do
want
any
of
their
pity
indeed
but
you
sir
who
have
the
feelings
of
a
gentleman
and
know
what
the
world
is
like
ourselves
take
care
whispered
tom
that
daughter
of
heale
may
be
listening
i
pull
her
hair
about
her
ears
if
i
caught
her
quoth
clara
and
then
ran
on
to
tell
how
elsley
never
kept
no
hours
nor
no
accounts
either
so
that
she
has
to
do
everything
poor
thing
and
no
thanks
either
and
never
knows
when
he
dine
or
when
he
breakfast
or
when
he
be
in
wandering
in
and
out
like
a
madman
and
sits
up
all
night
writing
his
nonsense
and
she
go
down
twice
and
three
times
a
night
in
the
cold
poor
dear
to
see
if
he
fallen
asleep
and
gets
abused
like
a
pickpocket
for
her
pains
which
was
an
exaggeration
and
lies
in
bed
all
the
morning
looking
at
the
flies
and
calls
after
her
if
his
shoes
want
tying
or
his
finger
aches
as
helpless
as
the
babe
unborn
and
will
never
do
nothing
useful
himself
not
even
to
hang
a
picture
or
move
a
chair
and
grumbles
at
her
if
he
sees
her
doing
anything
because
she
ai
listening
to
his
prosodies
and
snaps
and
worrits
and
wo
speak
to
her
sometimes
for
a
whole
morning
the
brute
but
is
he
not
fond
of
his
children
fond
yes
his
way
and
small
thanks
to
him
the
little
angels
to
play
with
when
they
good
and
tell
them
fairy
tales
wonder
why
he
likes
to
put
such
stuff
into
their
heads
and
then
send
out
of
the
room
if
they
make
a
noise
because
it
splits
his
poor
head
and
his
nerves
are
so
delicate
wish
he
had
hers
or
mine
either
doctor
thurnall
then
he
know
what
nerves
was
in
a
frail
woman
which
he
uses
us
both
as
his
negro
slaves
or
would
if
i
did
stand
up
to
him
pretty
sharp
now
and
then
and
give
him
a
piece
of
my
mind
which
i
will
do
like
the
faithful
servant
in
the
parable
if
he
kills
me
for
it
doctor
thurnall
does
he
drink
asked
tom
bluntly
he
she
answered
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
imply
that
even
one
masculine
vice
would
have
raised
him
in
her
eyes
he
not
man
enough
i
think
and
lives
on
his
slops
and
his
coffee
and
his
tapioca
and
how
he
ever
to
have
any
appetite
always
a
sitting
about
heaped
up
together
over
his
books
with
his
ribs
growing
into
his
backbone
if
he
only
go
and
take
his
walk
or
get
a
spade
and
dig
in
the
garden
or
anything
but
them
everlasting
papers
which
i
hates
the
sight
of
and
so
forth
from
all
which
tom
gathered
a
tolerably
clear
notion
of
the
poor
poet
state
of
body
and
mind
as
a
unmethodical
person
whose
was
owing
partly
to
perpetual
brooding
over
his
own
thoughts
and
partly
to
dyspepsia
brought
on
by
his
own
effeminacy
in
both
cases
not
a
thing
to
be
pitied
or
excused
by
the
hearty
and
valiant
doctor
and
tom
original
contempt
for
vavasour
took
a
darker
form
perhaps
one
too
dark
to
be
altogether
just
i
tackle
him
miss
clara
i
wish
you
would
i
sure
he
wants
some
one
to
look
after
him
just
now
he
half
wild
about
some
review
that
somebody
been
and
done
of
him
in
the
times
and
has
been
flinging
the
paper
about
the
room
and
calling
all
mankind
vipers
and
adders
and
hooting
herds
it
as
bad
as
swearing
i
say
and
running
to
my
mistress
to
make
her
read
it
and
see
how
the
whole
world
against
him
and
then
forbidding
her
to
defile
her
eyes
with
a
word
of
it
and
so
on
till
she
been
crying
all
the
morning
poor
dear
why
not
laughing
at
him
poor
thing
that
where
it
all
is
she
just
as
anxious
about
his
poetry
as
he
is
and
would
write
it
just
as
well
as
he
i
warrant
if
she
had
better
things
to
do
and
all
her
fuss
is
that
people
should
him
he
always
talking
about
appreciating
till
i
hate
the
sound
of
the
word
how
any
woman
can
go
on
so
after
a
man
that
behaves
as
he
does
but
we
all
soft
fools
i
afraid
doctor
thurnall
and
clara
began
a
languishing
look
or
two
across
the
counter
which
made
tom
answer
to
an
imaginary
doctor
heale
whom
he
heard
calling
from
within
yes
doctor
coming
this
moment
doctor
miss
clara
i
must
hear
more
next
time
you
may
trust
me
you
know
secret
as
the
grave
and
always
your
friend
and
your
lady
too
if
you
will
allow
me
to
do
myself
such
an
honour
coming
doctor
and
tom
bolted
through
the
glass
door
till
miss
clara
was
safe
on
her
way
up
the
street
very
well
said
tom
to
himself
knowledge
is
power
but
how
to
use
it
to
get
into
vavasour
confidence
and
show
an
inclination
to
take
her
part
against
her
husband
if
she
be
a
true
woman
she
would
order
me
out
of
the
house
on
the
spot
as
surely
as
a
would
fall
tooth
and
nail
on
me
as
a
base
intruder
if
i
dared
to
interfere
with
her
sacred
right
of
being
beaten
by
her
husband
when
she
chooses
no
i
must
go
straight
to
john
briggs
himself
and
bind
him
over
to
keep
the
peace
and
i
think
i
know
the
way
to
do
it
so
tom
pondered
over
many
plans
in
his
head
that
day
and
then
went
to
trebooze
and
saw
the
sick
child
and
sat
down
to
dinner
where
his
host
talked
loud
about
the
treboozes
of
trebooze
who
fought
in
the
spanish
armada
or
against
it
and
showed
an
unbounded
belief
in
the
greatness
and
antiquity
of
his
family
combined
with
a
historic
accuracy
about
equal
to
that
of
a
good
old
dame
of
those
parts
who
used
to
say
her
family
comed
over
the
water
that
she
knew
but
whether
it
were
with
the
conqueror
or
whether
it
were
wi
oliver
she
could
exactly
say
then
he
became
great
on
the
subject
of
old
county
families
in
general
and
poured
out
all
the
vials
of
his
wrath
on
that
confounded
upstart
of
a
newbroom
lord
minchampstead
supplanting
all
the
fine
old
blood
in
the
country
why
sir
that
pentremochyn
and
carcarrow
moors
too
good
shooting
there
there
used
to
be
they
ought
to
be
mine
sir
if
every
man
had
his
rights
and
then
followed
a
long
story
and
a
confused
one
withal
for
by
this
time
trebooze
had
drunk
a
great
deal
too
much
wine
and
as
he
became
aware
of
the
fact
became
proportionately
anxious
that
tom
should
drink
too
much
also
out
of
which
story
tom
picked
the
plain
facts
that
trebooze
father
had
mortgaged
pentremochyn
estate
for
more
than
its
value
and
that
lord
minchampstead
had
foreclosed
while
some
equally
respectable
uncle
or
cousin
just
deceased
had
sold
the
reversion
of
carcarrow
to
the
same
mighty
cotton
lord
twenty
years
before
and
this
is
the
way
sir
the
land
gets
eaten
up
by
a
set
of
tinkers
and
cobblers
and
jobbers
who
suck
the
blood
of
the
aristocracy
the
oaths
we
omit
leaving
the
reader
to
pepper
conversation
therewith
up
to
any
degree
of
heat
which
may
suit
his
palate
tom
sympathised
with
him
deeply
of
course
and
did
not
tell
him
as
he
might
have
done
that
he
thought
the
sooner
such
cumberers
of
the
ground
were
cleared
off
whether
by
an
encumbered
estates
act
such
as
we
may
see
yet
in
england
or
by
their
own
suicidal
folly
the
better
it
would
be
for
the
universe
in
general
and
perhaps
for
themselves
in
particular
but
he
only
answered
with
pleasant
effrontery
ah
my
dear
sir
i
am
sure
there
are
hundreds
of
good
sportsmen
who
can
sympathise
with
you
deeply
the
wonder
is
that
you
do
not
unite
and
defend
yourselves
for
not
only
in
the
west
of
england
but
in
ireland
and
in
wales
and
in
the
north
too
if
one
is
to
believe
those
novels
of
currer
bell
and
her
sister
there
is
a
large
and
important
class
of
landed
proprietors
of
the
same
stamp
as
yourself
and
exposed
to
the
very
same
dangers
i
wonder
at
times
that
you
do
not
all
join
and
use
your
combined
influence
on
the
government
the
government
all
a
set
of
whig
traitors
call
themselves
conservative
or
what
they
like
traitors
sir
from
that
fellow
peel
upwards
all
combined
to
crush
the
landed
gentry
ruin
the
church
betray
the
country
party
derby
free
trade
ruined
sir
maynooth
protection
treason
help
yourself
and
pass
the
you
know
old
fellow
and
trebooze
voice
died
away
and
he
slumbered
but
not
softly
the
door
opened
and
in
marched
trebooze
tall
tawdry
and
terrible
trebooze
it
past
eleven
hush
my
dear
madam
he
is
sleeping
so
sweetly
said
tom
rising
and
gulping
down
a
glass
not
of
wine
but
of
strong
ammonia
and
water
the
rogue
had
put
a
phial
thereof
in
his
pocket
that
morning
expecting
that
as
trebooze
had
said
he
would
be
required
to
make
a
night
of
it
she
was
silent
for
to
rouse
her
tyrant
was
more
than
she
dare
do
if
awakened
he
would
crave
for
brandy
and
water
and
if
he
got
that
sweet
poison
he
would
probably
become
furious
she
stood
for
half
a
minute
and
tom
who
knew
her
story
well
watched
her
curiously
she
is
a
fine
woman
and
with
a
far
finer
heart
in
her
than
that
brute
her
eyebrow
and
eye
now
have
the
true
siddons
stamp
the
great
white
forehead
and
little
nostril
breathing
scorn
and
what
a
attitude
i
should
like
madam
to
see
the
child
again
before
i
go
if
you
are
fit
sir
answered
she
brave
woman
comes
to
the
point
at
once
i
am
a
poor
doctor
madam
and
not
a
country
gentleman
and
have
neither
money
nor
health
to
spend
in
drinking
too
much
wine
then
why
do
you
encourage
him
in
it
sir
i
had
expected
a
very
different
sort
of
conduct
from
you
sir
tom
did
not
tell
her
what
she
would
not
no
woman
will
understand
that
it
is
morally
and
socially
impossible
to
escape
from
the
table
of
a
fool
till
either
he
or
you
are
conquered
and
she
was
too
shrewd
to
be
taken
in
by
commonplace
excuses
so
he
looked
her
very
full
in
the
face
and
replied
a
little
haughtily
with
a
slow
and
delicate
articulation
using
his
lips
more
than
usual
and
yet
compressing
them
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
if
i
have
unintentionally
displeased
you
but
if
you
ever
do
me
the
honour
of
knowing
more
of
me
you
will
be
the
first
to
confess
that
your
words
are
unjust
do
you
wish
me
to
see
your
son
or
do
you
not
poor
trebooze
looked
at
him
with
an
eye
which
showed
that
she
had
been
accustomed
to
study
character
keenly
perhaps
in
she
saw
that
tom
was
sober
he
had
taken
care
to
prove
that
by
the
way
in
which
he
spoke
and
she
saw
too
that
he
was
a
better
bred
man
than
her
husband
as
well
as
a
cleverer
she
dropped
her
eye
before
his
heaved
something
very
like
a
sigh
and
then
said
in
her
curt
fierce
tone
which
yet
implied
a
sort
of
sullen
resignation
yes
come
tom
went
up
and
looked
at
the
boy
again
as
he
lay
sleeping
a
beautiful
child
of
four
years
old
as
large
and
fair
a
child
as
man
need
see
and
yet
there
was
on
him
the
curse
of
his
father
sins
and
tom
knew
it
and
knew
that
his
mother
knew
it
also
what
a
noble
boy
said
he
after
looking
not
without
honest
admiration
upon
the
sleeping
child
who
had
kicked
off
his
and
lay
in
a
wild
graceful
attitude
as
children
are
wont
to
lie
just
like
an
old
greek
statue
of
cupid
it
all
depends
upon
you
madam
now
on
me
she
asked
in
a
startled
suspicious
tone
yes
he
is
a
magnificent
boy
but
i
can
only
give
palliatives
it
depends
upon
your
care
now
he
will
have
that
at
least
i
should
hope
she
said
nettled
and
on
your
influence
ten
years
hence
went
on
tom
my
influence
yes
only
keep
him
steady
and
he
may
grow
up
a
magnificent
man
if
not
you
will
excuse
me
but
you
must
not
let
him
live
as
freely
as
his
father
the
constitutions
of
the
two
are
very
different
do
talk
so
sir
steady
his
father
makes
him
drunk
now
if
he
can
teaches
him
to
swear
because
it
is
manly
god
help
him
and
me
tom
cunning
and
yet
kind
shaft
had
sped
he
guessed
that
with
a
coarse
woman
like
trebooze
his
best
plan
was
to
come
as
straight
to
the
point
as
he
could
and
he
was
right
ere
half
an
hour
was
over
that
woman
had
few
secrets
on
earth
which
tom
did
not
know
let
me
give
you
one
hint
before
i
go
said
he
at
last
persuade
your
husband
to
go
into
a
militia
regiment
why
he
would
see
so
much
company
and
it
would
be
so
expensive
the
expense
would
repay
itself
ten
times
over
the
company
which
he
would
see
would
be
sober
company
in
which
he
would
be
forced
to
keep
in
order
he
would
have
something
to
do
in
the
world
and
he
do
it
well
he
is
just
cut
out
for
a
soldier
and
might
have
made
a
gallant
one
by
now
if
he
had
had
other
men
chances
he
will
find
he
does
his
militia
work
well
and
it
will
be
a
new
interest
and
a
new
pride
and
a
new
life
to
him
and
meanwhile
madam
what
you
have
said
to
me
is
sacred
i
do
not
pretend
to
advise
or
interfere
only
tell
me
if
i
can
be
of
use
how
when
and
where
and
command
me
as
your
servant
and
tom
departed
having
struck
another
root
and
was
up
at
four
the
next
morning
he
never
worked
at
night
for
he
said
he
never
could
trust
brains
drawing
out
a
detailed
report
of
the
pentremochyn
cottages
which
he
sent
to
lord
minchampstead
with
and
your
lordship
will
excuse
my
saying
that
to
put
the
cottages
into
the
state
in
which
your
lordship
with
your
known
wish
for
progress
of
all
kinds
would
wish
to
see
them
is
a
responsibility
which
i
dare
not
take
on
myself
as
it
would
involve
a
present
outlay
of
not
less
than
this
sum
would
be
certainly
repaid
to
your
lordship
and
your
tenants
in
the
course
of
the
next
three
years
by
the
saving
in
an
opinion
for
which
i
subjoin
my
grounds
drawn
from
the
books
of
the
medical
officer
heale
but
the
responsibility
and
possible
unpopularity
which
employing
so
great
a
sum
would
involve
is
more
than
i
can
in
the
present
dependent
condition
of
medical
officers
dare
to
undertake
in
justice
to
heale
my
employer
save
at
your
special
command
i
am
bound
however
to
inform
your
lordship
that
this
outlay
would
i
think
perfectly
defend
the
hamlets
not
only
from
that
visit
of
the
cholera
which
we
have
every
reason
to
expect
next
summer
but
also
from
those
zymotic
diseases
which
as
your
lordship
will
see
by
my
returns
make
up
more
than
per
cent
of
the
aggregate
sickness
of
the
estate
which
letter
the
old
cotton
lord
put
in
his
pocket
rode
into
whitbury
therewith
and
showed
it
to
mark
armsworth
well
armsworth
what
am
i
to
do
well
my
lord
i
told
you
what
sort
of
a
man
you
have
to
do
with
one
that
does
his
work
thoroughly
and
i
think
pays
you
a
compliment
by
thinking
that
you
want
it
done
thoroughly
lord
minchampstead
was
of
the
same
opinion
but
he
did
not
say
so
few
indeed
have
ever
heard
lord
minchampstead
give
his
opinion
though
many
a
man
has
seen
him
act
on
it
i
send
down
orders
to
my
agent
do
why
then
my
good
friend
agents
are
always
in
league
with
farmers
or
guardians
or
builders
or
makers
or
attorneys
or
bankers
or
somebody
and
either
you
be
told
that
the
work
do
need
doing
or
have
a
job
brewed
out
of
it
to
get
off
a
lot
of
unsaleable
or
cracked
or
to
get
farm
ditches
dug
and
perhaps
the
highway
rates
saved
building
culverts
and
fifty
dodges
beside
i
know
their
game
and
you
ought
too
by
now
my
lord
begging
your
pardon
perhaps
i
do
mark
said
his
lordship
with
a
chuckle
so
i
say
let
the
man
that
found
the
fox
run
the
fox
and
kill
the
fox
and
take
the
brush
home
and
so
it
shall
be
quoth
my
lord
minchampstead
chapter
ix
am
i
not
a
woman
and
a
sister
but
what
was
the
mysterious
bond
between
la
cordifiamma
and
the
american
which
had
prevented
scoutbush
from
following
the
example
of
his
illustrious
progenitor
and
taking
a
viscountess
from
off
the
stage
certainly
any
one
who
had
seen
her
with
him
on
the
morning
after
scoutbush
visit
to
the
mellots
would
have
said
that
if
the
cause
was
love
the
love
was
all
on
one
side
she
was
standing
by
the
fireplace
in
a
splendid
pose
her
arm
resting
on
the
the
book
from
which
she
had
been
reciting
in
one
hand
the
other
playing
in
her
black
curls
as
her
eyes
glanced
back
ever
and
anon
at
her
own
profile
in
the
mirror
stangrave
was
half
sitting
in
a
low
chair
by
her
side
half
kneeling
on
the
footstool
before
her
looking
up
beseechingly
as
she
looked
down
tyrannically
stupid
this
reciting
of
course
it
is
i
want
realities
not
shams
life
not
the
stage
nature
not
art
throw
away
the
book
then
and
words
and
art
and
live
she
knew
well
what
he
meant
but
she
answered
as
if
she
had
misunderstood
him
thanks
i
live
already
and
in
good
company
enough
my
are
as
noble
as
they
are
obedient
do
all
which
i
demand
of
them
and
vanish
on
my
errands
when
i
tell
them
can
you
guess
who
my
last
is
since
i
tired
of
egmont
i
have
taken
sir
galahad
the
spotless
knight
did
you
ever
read
the
mort
a
hundred
times
of
course
and
she
spoke
in
a
tone
of
contempt
so
strong
that
it
must
have
been
affected
what
have
you
not
read
and
what
have
you
copied
no
wonder
that
these
english
have
been
what
they
have
been
for
centuries
while
their
heroes
have
been
the
galahads
and
their
homer
the
mort
enjoy
your
utopia
said
he
bitterly
do
you
fancy
they
acted
up
to
their
ideals
they
dreamed
of
the
quest
of
the
sangreal
but
which
of
them
ever
went
upon
it
and
does
it
count
for
nothing
that
they
felt
it
the
finest
thing
in
the
world
to
have
gone
on
it
had
it
been
possible
be
sure
if
their
ideal
was
so
so
lofty
their
practice
was
ruled
by
something
higher
than
the
almighty
dollar
and
so
are
some
other
men
marie
answered
he
reproachfully
yes
forsooth
when
the
almighty
dollar
is
there
already
and
a
man
has
ten
times
as
much
to
spend
every
day
as
he
can
possibly
invest
in
french
cookery
and
wines
and
fine
clothes
then
he
begins
to
lay
out
his
surplus
nobly
on
and
the
patronage
of
art
and
the
theatre
for
merely
aesthetic
purposes
of
course
and
when
the
lust
of
the
flesh
has
been
satisfied
thinks
himself
an
archangel
because
he
goes
on
to
satisfy
the
lust
of
the
eye
and
the
pride
of
life
christ
was
of
old
the
model
and
sir
galahad
was
the
hero
now
the
one
is
exchanged
for
goethe
and
the
other
for
wilhelm
meister
cruel
you
know
that
my
goethe
fever
is
long
past
how
would
you
have
known
of
its
existence
if
i
had
not
confessed
it
to
you
as
a
sin
of
old
years
have
i
not
said
to
you
again
and
again
show
me
the
thing
which
you
would
have
me
do
for
your
sake
and
see
if
i
will
not
do
it
for
my
sake
a
noble
reason
show
yourself
the
thing
which
you
will
do
for
its
own
sake
because
it
ought
to
be
done
show
it
yourself
i
say
i
can
not
show
you
if
your
own
eyes
can
not
see
the
sangreal
and
the
angels
who
are
bearing
it
before
you
it
is
because
they
are
dull
and
gross
and
am
i
milton
archangel
to
purge
them
with
euphrasy
and
rue
if
you
have
a
noble
heart
you
will
find
for
yourself
the
noblest
quest
if
not
who
can
prove
to
you
that
it
is
noble
and
tapping
impatiently
with
her
foot
she
went
on
to
herself
gentle
sound
an
awful
light
three
angels
bear
the
holy
grail
with
folded
feet
in
stoles
of
white
on
sleeping
wings
they
sail
ah
blessed
vision
blood
of
god
the
spirit
beats
her
mortal
bars
as
down
dark
tides
the
glory
slides
and
mingles
with
the
stars
why
there
was
not
a
knight
of
the
round
table
was
there
who
did
not
give
up
all
to
go
upon
that
quest
though
only
one
was
found
worthy
to
fulfil
it
but
the
knights
sit
drinking
hock
and
champagne
or
drive
and
never
fancy
that
there
is
a
quest
at
all
why
talk
in
these
parables
so
the
jews
asked
of
their
prophets
they
are
no
parables
to
my
sir
galahad
now
go
if
you
please
i
must
be
busy
and
write
letters
he
rose
with
a
look
half
of
disappointment
half
amused
and
yet
his
face
bore
a
firmness
which
seemed
to
say
you
will
be
mine
yet
as
he
rose
he
cast
his
eye
upon
the
and
upon
a
letter
which
lay
there
and
as
he
did
so
his
cheek
grew
pale
and
his
brows
knitted
the
letter
was
addressed
to
thomas
thurnall
aberalva
is
this
then
your
sir
galahad
asked
he
after
a
pause
during
which
he
had
choked
down
his
rising
jealousy
while
she
looked
first
at
herself
in
the
glass
and
then
at
him
and
then
at
herself
again
with
a
determined
and
triumphant
air
and
what
if
it
be
so
he
then
has
achieved
the
quest
of
the
sangreal
stangrave
spoke
bitterly
and
with
an
emphasis
upon
the
he
and
what
if
he
have
do
you
know
him
answered
she
while
her
face
lighted
up
with
eager
interest
which
she
did
not
care
to
conceal
perhaps
chose
in
her
woman
love
of
tormenting
to
parade
i
knew
a
man
of
that
name
once
he
replied
in
a
carefully
careless
tone
which
did
not
deceive
her
an
adventurer
a
doctor
if
i
recollect
who
had
been
in
texas
and
mexico
and
i
know
not
where
besides
agreeable
enough
he
was
but
as
for
your
quest
of
the
sangreal
whatever
it
may
be
he
seemed
to
have
as
little
notion
of
anything
beyond
his
own
interest
as
any
greek
i
ever
met
unjust
your
words
only
show
how
little
you
can
see
that
man
of
all
men
i
ever
met
saw
the
quest
at
once
and
followed
it
at
the
risk
of
his
own
life
as
far
at
least
as
he
was
concerned
with
it
ay
even
when
he
pretended
to
see
nothing
oh
there
is
more
generosity
in
that
man
affected
selfishness
than
in
all
the
noisy
which
i
have
met
with
in
the
world
thurnall
oh
you
know
his
nobleness
as
little
as
he
knows
it
himself
then
he
i
am
to
suppose
is
your
for
as
long
at
least
as
your
present
dream
lasts
asked
he
with
white
compressed
lips
he
might
have
been
i
believe
she
answered
carelessly
if
he
had
even
taken
the
trouble
to
ask
me
marie
this
is
too
much
do
you
not
know
to
whom
you
speak
to
one
who
deserves
if
not
common
courtesy
at
least
common
mercy
because
he
adores
me
and
so
forth
so
has
many
a
man
done
or
told
me
that
he
has
done
so
do
you
know
that
i
might
be
a
viscountess
so
sabina
informs
me
if
i
but
chose
a
viscountess
pray
accept
your
effete
english
aristocrat
and
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
accept
my
best
wishes
for
your
happiness
my
effete
english
aristocrat
did
i
show
him
that
pedigree
of
mine
which
i
have
ere
now
threatened
to
show
you
would
perhaps
be
less
horrified
at
it
than
you
are
marie
i
can
not
bear
this
tell
me
only
what
you
mean
what
care
i
for
pedigree
i
want
you
worship
you
and
that
is
enough
marie
you
admire
me
because
i
am
beautiful
what
thanks
do
i
owe
you
for
finding
out
so
patent
a
fact
what
do
you
do
more
to
me
than
i
do
to
myself
and
she
glanced
back
once
more
at
the
mirror
marie
you
know
that
your
words
are
false
i
do
more
you
admire
me
interrupted
she
because
i
am
clever
what
thanks
to
you
for
that
again
what
do
you
do
more
to
me
than
you
do
to
yourself
and
this
after
all
after
what
after
you
found
me
or
rather
i
found
you
you
the
critic
the
arbiter
of
the
greenroom
the
teaching
others
how
to
do
nothing
most
gracefully
the
goethe
who
must
for
the
sake
of
his
own
try
experiments
on
every
weak
woman
whom
he
met
and
i
the
new
phenomenon
whom
you
must
appreciate
to
show
your
own
taste
patronise
to
show
your
own
liberality
develop
to
show
your
own
insight
into
character
you
found
yourself
mistaken
you
had
attempted
to
play
with
the
tigress
and
behold
she
was
talons
to
angle
for
the
silly
fish
and
behold
the
fish
was
the
better
angler
and
caught
you
marie
have
mercy
is
your
heart
iron
no
but
fire
as
my
name
shows
and
she
stood
looking
down
on
him
with
a
glare
of
dreadful
beauty
fire
indeed
yes
fire
that
i
may
scorch
you
kindle
you
madden
you
to
do
my
work
and
wear
the
heart
of
fire
which
i
wear
day
and
night
stangrave
looked
at
her
startled
was
she
mad
her
face
did
not
say
so
her
brow
was
white
her
features
calm
her
eye
fierce
and
contemptuous
but
clear
steady
full
of
meaning
so
you
know
mr
thurnall
said
she
after
a
while
yes
why
do
you
ask
because
he
is
the
only
friend
i
have
on
earth
the
only
friend
marie
the
only
one
answered
she
calmly
who
seeing
the
right
has
gone
and
done
it
forthwith
when
did
you
see
him
last
i
have
not
been
acquainted
with
thurnall
for
some
years
said
stangrave
haughtily
in
plain
words
you
have
quarrelled
with
him
stangrave
bit
his
lip
he
and
i
had
a
difference
he
insulted
my
nation
and
we
parted
she
laughed
a
long
loud
bitter
laugh
which
rang
through
ears
insulted
your
nation
and
on
what
grounds
pray
about
that
accursed
slavery
question
la
cordifiamma
looked
at
him
with
lips
a
while
so
then
i
was
not
aware
of
this
even
so
long
ago
you
saw
the
sangreal
and
did
not
know
it
when
you
saw
it
no
wonder
that
since
then
you
have
been
staring
at
it
for
months
in
your
very
hands
played
with
it
admired
it
made
verses
about
it
to
show
off
your
own
taste
and
yet
were
blind
to
it
the
whole
time
farewell
then
marie
what
do
you
mean
and
stangrave
caught
both
her
hands
hush
if
you
please
i
know
you
are
eloquent
enough
when
you
choose
though
you
have
been
somewhat
dumb
and
monosyllabic
in
the
presence
of
the
actress
whom
you
undertook
to
educate
but
i
know
that
you
can
be
eloquent
so
spare
me
any
brilliant
appeals
which
can
only
go
to
prove
that
already
settled
fact
between
you
and
me
lie
two
great
gulfs
the
one
i
have
told
you
of
and
from
it
i
shrink
the
other
i
have
not
told
you
of
from
it
you
would
shrink
the
first
is
your
quest
of
the
sangreal
she
smiled
assent
bitterly
enough
and
the
second
she
did
not
answer
she
was
looking
at
herself
in
the
mirror
and
stangrave
in
spite
of
his
almost
doting
affection
flushed
with
anger
almost
contempt
at
her
vanity
and
yet
was
it
vanity
which
was
expressed
in
that
face
no
but
dread
horror
almost
disgust
as
she
gazed
with
startled
eyes
struggling
and
yet
struggling
in
vain
to
turn
her
face
from
some
horrible
sight
as
if
her
own
image
had
been
the
gorgon
head
what
is
it
marie
speak
but
she
answered
nothing
for
that
last
question
she
had
no
heart
to
answer
no
heart
to
tell
him
that
in
her
veins
were
some
drops
at
least
of
the
blood
of
slaves
instinctively
she
had
looked
round
at
the
mirror
for
might
he
not
if
he
had
eyes
discover
that
secret
for
himself
were
there
not
in
her
features
traces
of
that
taint
and
as
she
looked
was
it
the
mere
play
of
her
excited
fancy
or
did
her
eyelid
slope
more
and
more
her
nostril
shorten
and
curl
her
lips
enlarge
her
mouth
itself
protrude
it
was
more
than
the
play
of
fancy
for
stangrave
saw
it
as
well
as
she
her
actress
imagination
fixed
on
the
african
type
with
an
intensity
proportioned
to
her
dread
of
seeing
it
in
herself
had
moulded
her
features
for
the
moment
into
the
very
shape
which
it
dreaded
and
stangrave
saw
it
and
shuddered
as
he
saw
another
half
minute
and
that
face
also
had
melted
out
of
the
mirror
at
least
for
marie
eyes
and
in
its
place
an
ancient
negress
withered
as
the
wrinkled
ape
but
with
eyes
closed
in
death
marie
knew
that
face
well
a
face
which
haunted
many
a
dream
of
hers
once
seen
but
never
forgotten
since
for
to
that
old
coffin
had
her
mother
the
gay
quadroon
woman
flaunting
in
finery
which
was
the
price
of
shame
led
marie
when
she
was
but
a
three
years
child
and
marie
had
seen
her
bend
over
the
corpse
and
call
it
her
dear
old
granny
and
weep
bitter
tears
suddenly
she
shook
off
the
spell
and
looked
round
and
down
terrified
her
eye
caught
stangrave
she
saw
or
thought
she
saw
by
the
expression
of
his
face
that
he
knew
all
and
burst
away
with
a
shriek
he
sprang
up
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
marie
beloved
marie
she
looked
up
at
him
struggling
the
dark
expression
had
vanished
and
stangrave
eyes
could
see
nothing
in
that
face
but
the
refined
and
yet
rich
beauty
of
the
italian
marie
this
is
mere
madness
you
excite
yourself
till
you
know
not
what
you
say
or
what
you
are
i
know
what
i
am
murmured
she
but
he
hurried
on
unheeding
you
love
me
you
know
you
love
me
and
you
madden
yourself
by
refusing
to
confess
it
he
felt
her
heart
throb
as
he
spoke
and
knew
that
he
spoke
truth
what
gulfs
are
these
you
dream
of
no
i
will
not
ask
there
is
no
gulf
between
me
and
one
whom
i
adore
who
has
thrown
a
spell
over
me
which
i
can
not
resist
which
i
glory
in
not
resisting
for
you
have
been
my
guide
my
morning
star
which
has
awakened
me
to
new
life
if
i
have
a
noble
purpose
upon
earth
if
i
have
roused
myself
from
that
conceited
dream
of
which
now
looks
to
me
so
cold
and
barren
and
tawdry
into
the
hope
of
becoming
useful
beneficent
to
whom
do
i
owe
it
but
to
you
marie
no
there
is
no
gulf
marie
you
are
my
wife
and
you
alone
and
he
held
her
so
firmly
and
gazed
down
upon
her
with
such
strong
manhood
that
her
woman
heart
quailed
and
he
might
perhaps
have
conquered
then
and
there
had
not
sabina
summoned
by
her
shriek
entered
hastily
good
heavens
what
is
the
matter
wait
but
one
minute
mellot
said
he
the
next
i
shall
introduce
you
to
my
bride
never
never
never
cried
she
and
breaking
from
him
flew
into
sabina
arms
leave
me
leave
me
to
bear
my
curse
alone
and
she
broke
out
into
such
wild
weeping
and
refused
so
wildly
to
hear
another
word
from
stangrave
that
he
went
away
in
despair
the
prize
snatched
from
his
grasp
in
the
very
moment
of
seeming
victory
he
went
in
search
of
claude
who
had
agreed
to
meet
him
at
the
exhibition
in
trafalgar
square
thither
stangrave
rolled
away
in
his
cab
his
heart
full
of
many
thoughts
marie
words
about
him
though
harsh
and
exaggerated
were
on
the
whole
true
she
had
fascinated
him
utterly
to
marry
her
was
now
the
one
object
of
his
life
she
had
awakened
in
him
as
he
had
confessed
noble
desires
to
be
useful
but
the
discovery
that
he
was
to
be
useful
to
the
negro
that
abolition
was
the
sangreal
in
the
quest
of
which
he
was
to
go
forth
was
as
disagreeable
a
discovery
as
he
could
well
have
made
from
public
life
in
any
shape
with
all
its
vulgar
noise
its
petty
chicanery
its
pandering
to
the
mob
whom
he
despised
he
had
always
shrunk
as
so
many
americans
of
his
stamp
have
done
he
had
no
wish
to
struggle
unrewarded
and
disappointed
in
the
ranks
of
the
minority
while
to
gain
place
and
power
on
the
side
of
the
majority
was
to
lend
himself
to
that
fatal
policy
which
ever
since
the
missouri
compromise
of
has
been
gradually
making
the
northern
states
more
and
more
the
tools
of
the
southern
ones
he
had
no
wish
to
be
threatened
in
congress
with
having
his
northerner
ears
nailed
to
the
counter
like
his
own
base
coin
or
to
be
informed
that
he
with
the
of
the
north
were
the
white
slaves
of
a
southern
aristocracy
of
slaveholders
he
had
enough
comprehension
of
enough
admiration
for
the
noble
principles
of
the
american
constitution
to
see
that
the
democratic
mobs
of
irish
and
germans
who
were
stupidly
playing
into
the
hands
of
the
southerners
were
not
exactly
carrying
them
out
but
he
had
no
mind
to
face
either
irish
or
southerners
the
former
were
too
vulgar
for
his
delicacy
the
latter
too
aristocratic
for
his
pride
sprung
as
he
held
and
rightly
from
as
fine
old
english
blood
as
any
virginian
though
it
did
happen
to
be
puritan
and
not
cavalier
he
had
no
lust
to
come
into
contact
with
men
who
considered
him
much
further
below
them
in
rank
than
an
english
footman
is
below
an
english
nobleman
who
indeed
would
some
of
them
look
down
on
the
english
nobleman
himself
as
a
mushroom
of
yesterday
so
he
compounded
with
his
conscience
by
ignoring
the
whole
matter
and
by
looking
on
the
state
of
public
affairs
on
his
side
of
the
atlantic
with
a
cynicism
which
very
soon
as
is
usual
with
rich
men
passed
into
epicureanism
poetry
and
music
pictures
and
statues
amusement
and
travel
became
his
idols
and
cultivation
his
substitute
for
the
plain
duty
of
patriotism
and
wandering
luxuriously
over
the
world
he
learnt
to
sentimentalise
over
cathedrals
and
monasteries
pictures
and
statues
saints
and
kaisers
with
a
lazy
regret
that
such
forms
of
beauty
and
nobleness
were
no
longer
possible
in
a
world
of
scrip
and
railroads
but
without
any
notion
that
it
was
his
duty
to
reproduce
in
his
own
life
or
that
of
his
country
as
much
as
he
could
of
the
said
beauty
and
nobleness
and
now
he
was
sorely
tried
it
was
interesting
enough
to
develop
the
peculiar
turn
of
marie
genius
by
writing
for
her
plays
about
liberty
just
as
he
would
have
written
plays
about
jealousy
or
anything
else
for
representing
which
she
had
capabilities
but
to
be
called
on
to
act
in
that
slavery
question
the
one
in
which
he
knew
as
all
sensible
americans
do
that
the
life
and
death
of
his
country
depended
and
which
for
that
very
reason
he
had
carefully
ignored
till
a
more
convenient
season
finding
in
its
very
difficulty
and
danger
an
excuse
for
leaving
it
to
solve
itself
to
have
this
thrust
on
him
and
by
her
as
the
price
of
the
thing
which
he
must
have
or
die
if
she
had
asked
for
his
right
hand
he
would
have
given
it
sooner
and
he
entered
the
royal
academy
that
day
in
much
the
same
humour
as
that
of
a
fine
lady
who
should
find
herself
suddenly
dragged
from
the
into
the
in
her
tenderest
array
of
gauze
and
jewels
and
there
peremptorily
compelled
to
sift
the
cinders
under
the
superintendence
of
the
sweep
and
the
glad
to
escape
from
questions
which
he
had
rather
not
answer
too
soon
he
went
in
search
of
claude
and
found
him
before
one
of
those
pictures
which
claude
does
not
appreciate
as
he
ought
desinit
in
culicem
mulier
formosa
supernè
said
stangrave
as
he
looked
over
claude
shoulder
but
i
suppose
he
followed
nature
and
copied
his
model
that
he
did
said
claude
for
i
know
who
his
model
was
but
if
he
did
he
had
no
business
to
do
so
i
object
on
principle
to
these
men
notion
of
what
copying
nature
means
i
do
deny
him
talent
i
am
ready
to
confess
that
there
is
more
imagination
and
more
honest
work
in
that
picture
than
in
any
one
in
the
room
the
hysterical
all
but
grinning
joy
upon
the
mother
face
is
a
miracle
of
truth
i
have
seen
the
expression
more
than
once
doctors
see
it
often
in
the
sudden
revulsion
from
terror
and
agony
to
certainty
and
peace
i
only
marvel
where
he
ever
met
it
but
the
general
effect
is
unpleasing
marred
by
patches
of
sheer
ugliness
like
that
child
foot
there
is
the
same
mistake
in
all
his
pictures
whatever
they
are
they
are
not
beautiful
and
no
magnificence
of
will
make
up
in
my
eyes
for
wilful
ugliness
of
form
i
say
that
nature
is
beautiful
and
therefore
nature
can
not
have
been
truly
copied
or
the
general
effect
would
have
been
beautiful
also
i
never
found
out
the
fallacy
till
the
other
day
when
looking
at
a
portrait
by
one
of
them
the
woman
for
whom
it
was
meant
was
standing
by
my
side
young
and
lovely
the
portrait
hung
there
neither
young
nor
lovely
but
a
wrinkled
caricature
twenty
years
older
than
the
model
i
surely
know
the
portrait
you
mean
lady
d
yes
he
had
simply
under
pretence
of
following
nature
caricatured
her
into
a
woman
twenty
years
older
than
she
is
but
did
you
ever
see
a
modern
portrait
which
more
perfectly
expressed
character
which
more
completely
fulfilled
the
requirements
which
you
laid
down
a
few
evenings
since
never
and
that
makes
me
all
the
more
cross
with
the
wilful
mistake
of
it
he
had
painted
every
wrinkle
why
not
if
they
were
there
because
he
had
painted
a
face
not
of
the
size
of
life
what
right
had
he
to
cram
into
that
small
space
all
the
marks
which
nature
had
spread
over
a
far
larger
one
why
not
again
if
he
diminished
the
marks
in
proportion
just
what
neither
he
nor
any
man
could
do
without
making
them
so
small
as
to
be
invisible
save
under
a
microscope
and
the
result
was
that
he
had
caricatured
every
wrinkle
as
his
friend
has
in
those
horrible
knuckles
of
shem
wife
besides
i
deny
utterly
your
assertion
that
one
is
bound
to
paint
what
is
there
on
that
very
fallacy
are
they
all
making
shipwreck
not
paint
what
is
there
and
you
are
the
man
who
talks
of
art
being
highest
when
it
copies
nature
exactly
and
therefore
you
must
paint
not
what
is
there
but
what
you
see
there
they
forget
that
human
beings
are
men
with
two
eyes
and
not
daguerreotype
lenses
with
one
eye
and
so
are
contriving
and
striving
to
introduce
into
their
pictures
the
very
defect
of
the
daguerreotype
which
the
stereoscope
is
required
to
correct
i
comprehend
they
forget
that
the
double
vision
of
our
two
eyes
gives
a
softness
and
indistinctness
and
roundness
to
every
outline
exactly
so
and
therefore
while
for
distant
landscapes
motionless
and
already
softened
by
atmosphere
the
daguerreotype
is
invaluable
i
shall
do
nothing
else
this
summer
but
work
at
it
yet
for
taking
portraits
in
any
true
sense
it
will
be
always
useless
not
only
for
the
reason
i
just
gave
but
for
another
one
which
the
have
forgotten
because
all
the
features
can
not
be
in
focus
at
once
oh
no
i
am
not
speaking
of
that
art
for
aught
i
know
may
overcome
that
for
it
is
a
mere
defect
in
the
instrument
what
i
mean
is
this
it
tries
to
represent
as
still
what
never
yet
was
still
for
the
thousandth
part
of
a
second
that
is
the
human
face
and
as
seen
by
a
spectator
who
is
perfectly
still
which
no
man
ever
yet
was
my
dear
fellow
do
you
see
that
what
some
painters
call
idealising
a
portrait
is
if
it
be
wisely
done
really
painting
for
you
the
face
which
you
see
and
know
and
love
her
features
with
expression
varying
more
rapidly
than
the
gleam
of
the
diamond
on
her
finger
features
which
you
in
your
turn
are
looking
at
with
eyes
while
perhaps
if
it
is
a
face
which
you
love
and
have
lingered
over
a
dozen
other
expressions
equally
belonging
to
it
are
hanging
in
your
memory
and
blending
themselves
with
the
actual
picture
on
your
retina
till
every
little
angle
is
somewhat
rounded
every
little
wrinkle
somewhat
softened
every
little
shade
somewhat
blended
with
the
surrounding
light
so
that
the
sum
total
of
what
you
see
and
are
intended
by
heaven
to
see
is
something
far
softer
lovelier
younger
perhaps
thank
heaven
than
it
would
look
if
your
head
was
screwed
down
in
a
vice
to
look
with
one
eye
at
her
head
screwed
down
in
a
vice
also
though
even
that
thanks
to
the
muscles
of
the
eye
would
not
produce
the
required
ugliness
and
the
only
possible
method
of
fulfilling
the
ideal
would
be
to
set
a
petrified
cyclops
to
paint
his
petrified
brother
you
are
spiteful
not
at
all
i
am
standing
up
for
art
and
for
nature
too
for
instance
sabina
has
wrinkles
she
says
too
that
she
has
grey
hairs
coming
the
former
i
wo
see
and
therefore
do
the
latter
i
ca
see
because
i
am
not
looking
for
them
nor
i
either
said
stangrave
smiling
i
assure
you
the
announcement
is
new
to
me
of
course
who
can
see
wrinkles
in
the
light
of
those
eyes
that
smile
that
complexion
certainly
said
stangrave
if
i
asked
for
her
portrait
as
i
shall
do
some
day
and
the
artist
sat
down
and
painted
the
said
of
time
on
pretence
of
their
being
there
i
should
consider
it
an
impertinence
on
his
part
what
business
has
he
to
spy
out
what
nature
has
taken
such
charming
trouble
to
conceal
again
said
claude
such
a
face
as
cordifiamma
when
it
is
at
rest
in
deep
thought
there
are
lines
in
it
which
utterly
puzzle
one
touches
which
are
eastern
kabyle
almost
quadroon
stangrave
started
claude
went
on
unconscious
but
who
sees
them
in
the
light
of
that
beauty
they
are
defects
no
doubt
but
defects
which
no
one
would
observe
without
deep
study
of
the
face
they
express
her
character
no
more
than
a
scar
would
and
therefore
when
i
paint
her
as
i
must
and
will
i
shall
utterly
ignore
them
if
on
the
other
hand
i
met
the
same
lines
in
a
face
which
i
knew
to
have
quadroon
blood
in
it
i
should
religiously
copy
them
because
then
they
would
be
integral
elements
of
the
face
you
understand
understand
yes
answered
stangrave
in
a
tone
which
made
claude
look
up
that
strange
scene
of
half
an
hour
before
flashed
across
him
what
if
it
were
no
fancy
what
if
marie
had
african
blood
in
her
veins
and
stangrave
shuddered
and
felt
for
the
moment
that
thousands
of
pounds
would
be
a
cheap
price
to
pay
for
the
discovery
that
his
fancy
was
a
false
one
yes
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
said
he
recovering
himself
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
but
as
you
say
what
if
she
had
quadroon
blood
i
i
never
said
so
or
dreamt
of
it
oh
i
mistook
do
you
know
though
where
she
came
from
i
you
forget
my
dear
fellow
that
you
yourself
introduced
her
to
us
of
course
but
i
thought
mellot
might
women
always
makes
confidences
all
we
know
is
what
i
suppose
you
knew
long
ago
that
her
most
intimate
friend
next
to
you
seems
to
be
an
old
friend
of
ours
named
thurnall
an
old
friend
of
yours
oh
yes
we
have
known
him
these
fifteen
years
met
him
first
at
paris
and
after
that
went
round
the
world
with
him
and
saw
infinite
adventures
sabina
and
i
spent
three
months
with
him
once
among
the
savages
in
a
island
and
a
very
pretty
romance
our
stay
and
our
escape
would
make
we
were
all
three
i
believe
to
have
been
cooked
and
eaten
if
tom
had
not
got
us
off
by
that
wonderful
address
which
if
you
know
him
you
must
know
well
enough
yes
answered
stangrave
coldly
as
in
a
dream
i
have
known
thurnall
in
past
years
but
not
in
connection
with
la
signora
cordifiamma
i
was
not
aware
till
this
moment
this
morning
i
mean
that
they
knew
each
other
you
astound
me
why
she
talks
of
him
to
us
all
day
long
as
of
one
to
whom
she
has
the
deepest
obligations
she
was
ready
to
rush
into
our
arms
when
she
first
found
that
we
knew
him
he
is
a
greater
hero
in
her
eyes
i
sometimes
fancy
than
even
you
are
she
does
nothing
or
fancies
that
she
does
nothing
for
you
know
her
pretty
wilfulness
without
writing
for
his
advice
i
a
hero
in
her
eyes
i
was
really
not
aware
of
that
fact
said
stangrave
more
coldly
than
ever
for
bitter
jealousy
had
taken
possession
of
his
heart
do
you
know
then
what
this
same
obligation
may
be
i
never
asked
i
hate
gossiping
and
i
make
a
rule
to
inquire
into
no
secrets
but
such
as
are
voluntarily
confided
to
me
and
i
know
that
she
has
never
told
sabina
i
suppose
she
is
married
to
him
that
is
the
simplest
explanation
of
the
mystery
impossible
what
can
you
mean
if
she
ever
marries
living
man
she
will
marry
you
then
she
will
never
marry
living
man
said
stangrave
to
himself
my
dear
fellow
i
have
an
engagement
at
the
traveller
and
away
went
stangrave
leaving
claude
sorely
puzzled
but
little
dreaming
of
the
into
which
he
had
put
a
match
but
he
was
puzzled
still
more
that
night
when
by
the
latest
post
a
note
came
from
stangrave
said
claude
why
in
the
name
of
all
wonders
and
he
read
i
am
just
starting
for
the
continent
on
sudden
and
urgent
business
what
my
destination
is
i
hardly
can
tell
you
yet
you
will
hear
from
me
in
the
course
of
the
summer
claude
countenance
fell
and
the
note
fell
likewise
sabina
snatched
it
up
read
it
and
gave
la
cordifiamma
a
look
which
made
her
spring
from
the
sofa
and
snatch
it
in
turn
she
read
it
through
with
trembling
hands
and
blanching
cheeks
and
then
dropped
fainting
upon
the
floor
they
laid
her
on
the
sofa
and
while
they
were
recovering
her
claude
told
sabina
the
only
clue
which
he
had
to
the
american
conduct
namely
that
afternoon
conversation
sabina
shook
her
head
over
it
for
to
her
also
the
explanation
had
suggested
itself
was
marie
thurnall
wife
or
did
she
it
was
possible
however
painful
stand
to
him
in
some
less
honourable
relation
which
she
would
fain
forget
now
in
a
new
passion
for
stangrave
for
that
marie
loved
stangrave
sabina
knew
well
enough
the
doubt
was
so
ugly
that
it
must
be
solved
and
when
she
had
got
the
poor
thing
safe
into
her
bedroom
she
alluded
to
it
as
gently
as
she
could
marie
sprang
up
in
indignant
innocence
he
whatever
he
may
be
to
others
i
know
not
but
to
me
he
has
been
purity
and
nobleness
itself
a
brother
a
father
yes
if
i
had
no
other
reason
for
trusting
him
i
should
love
him
for
that
alone
that
however
tempted
he
may
have
been
and
heaven
knows
he
was
tempted
he
could
respect
the
honour
of
his
friend
though
that
friend
lay
sleeping
in
a
soldier
grave
ten
thousand
miles
away
and
marie
threw
herself
upon
sabina
neck
and
under
the
pressure
of
her
misery
sobbed
out
to
her
the
story
of
her
life
what
it
was
need
not
be
told
a
little
common
sense
and
a
little
knowledge
of
human
nature
will
enable
the
reader
to
fill
up
for
himself
the
story
of
a
beautiful
slave
sabina
soothed
her
and
cheered
her
and
soothed
and
cheered
her
most
of
all
by
telling
her
in
return
the
story
of
her
own
life
not
so
dark
a
one
but
almost
as
sad
and
strange
and
poor
marie
took
heart
when
she
found
in
her
great
need
a
sister
in
the
communion
of
sorrows
and
you
have
been
through
all
this
so
beautiful
and
bright
as
you
are
you
whom
i
should
have
fancied
always
living
the
life
of
the
and
yet
not
a
scar
or
a
wrinkle
has
it
left
behind
they
were
there
once
marie
but
god
and
claude
smoothed
them
away
i
have
no
claude
and
no
god
i
think
at
times
no
god
marie
then
how
did
you
come
hither
marie
was
silent
reproved
and
then
passionately
why
does
he
not
right
my
people
that
question
was
one
to
which
sabina
little
scheme
of
the
universe
had
no
answer
why
should
it
while
many
a
scheme
which
pretends
to
be
far
vaster
and
more
infallible
has
none
as
yet
so
she
was
silent
and
sat
with
marie
head
upon
her
bosom
caressing
the
black
curls
till
she
had
soothed
her
into
sobbing
exhaustion
there
lie
there
and
rest
you
shall
be
my
child
my
poor
marie
i
have
a
fresh
child
every
week
but
i
shall
find
plenty
of
room
in
my
heart
for
you
my
poor
hunted
deer
you
will
keep
my
secret
why
keep
it
no
one
need
be
ashamed
of
it
here
in
free
england
but
he
he
you
do
not
know
sabina
those
northerners
with
all
their
boasts
of
freedom
shrink
from
us
just
as
much
as
our
own
masters
oh
marie
do
not
be
so
unjust
to
him
he
is
too
noble
and
you
must
know
it
yourself
ay
if
he
stood
alone
if
he
were
even
going
to
live
in
england
if
he
would
let
himself
be
himself
but
public
opinion
sobbed
the
poor
it
has
been
his
god
sabina
to
be
a
leader
of
taste
and
fashion
admired
and
complete
the
crichton
of
newport
and
brooklyn
and
he
could
not
bear
scorn
the
loss
of
society
why
should
he
bear
it
for
me
if
he
had
been
one
of
the
abolitionist
party
it
would
have
been
different
but
he
has
no
sympathy
with
them
good
narrow
pious
people
or
they
with
him
he
could
not
be
satisfied
in
their
society
or
i
either
for
i
crave
after
it
all
as
much
as
he
wealth
luxury
art
brilliant
company
admiration
oh
inconsistent
wretch
that
i
am
and
that
makes
me
love
him
all
the
more
and
yet
makes
me
so
harsh
to
him
wickedly
cruel
as
i
was
because
when
i
am
reproving
his
weakness
i
am
reproving
my
own
and
because
i
am
angry
with
myself
i
grow
angry
with
him
too
envious
of
him
i
do
believe
at
moments
and
all
his
success
and
luxury
and
so
poor
marie
sobbed
out
her
confused
confession
of
that
strange
double
nature
which
so
many
quadroons
seem
to
owe
to
their
mixed
blood
a
strong
side
of
deep
feeling
ambition
energy
an
intellect
rather
greek
in
its
rapidity
than
english
in
sturdiness
and
withal
a
weak
side
of
instability
inconsistency
hasty
passion
love
of
present
enjoyment
sometimes
too
a
tendency
to
untruth
which
is
the
mark
not
perhaps
of
the
african
specially
but
of
every
enslaved
race
consolation
was
all
that
sabina
could
give
it
was
too
late
to
act
stangrave
was
gone
and
week
after
week
rolled
by
without
a
line
from
the
wanderer
chapter
x
the
recognition
elsley
vavasour
is
sitting
one
morning
in
his
study
every
comfort
of
which
is
of
lucia
arrangement
and
invention
beating
the
of
his
brains
for
pretty
thoughts
on
he
struggles
through
that
wild
and
too
luxuriant
cover
now
brought
up
by
a
lawyer
now
stumbling
over
a
root
now
bogged
in
a
green
spring
now
flushing
a
stray
covey
of
birds
of
paradise
now
a
sphinx
chimaera
strix
lamia
eagle
austrian
as
will
appear
shortly
or
other
portent
only
to
be
seen
in
the
recesses
of
that
enchanted
forest
the
convolutions
of
a
brain
up
they
whir
and
rattle
making
like
most
game
more
noise
than
they
are
worth
some
get
back
some
dodge
among
the
trees
the
fair
shots
are
few
and
far
between
but
elsley
blazes
away
right
and
left
with
trusty
quill
and
to
do
him
justice
seldom
misses
his
aim
for
practice
has
made
him
a
sure
and
quick
marksman
in
his
own
line
moreover
all
is
game
which
gets
up
for
he
is
shooting
for
the
kitchen
or
rather
for
the
london
market
as
many
a
noble
sportsman
does
and
thinks
no
shame
his
new
volume
of
poems
the
wreck
included
is
in
the
press
but
behold
it
is
not
as
long
as
the
publisher
thinks
fit
and
brown
and
younger
have
written
down
to
entreat
in
haste
for
some
four
hundred
lines
more
on
any
subject
which
vavasour
may
choose
and
therefore
is
elsley
beating
his
home
covers
heavily
shot
over
though
they
have
been
already
this
season
in
hopes
that
a
few
head
of
his
own
game
may
still
be
left
or
in
default
for
human
nature
is
the
same
in
poets
and
in
sportsmen
that
a
few
head
may
have
strayed
in
out
of
his
neighbours
manors
at
last
the
sport
slackens
for
the
sportsman
is
getting
tired
and
hungry
also
to
carry
on
the
metaphor
for
he
has
seen
the
postman
come
up
the
front
walk
a
quarter
of
an
hour
since
and
the
letters
have
not
been
brought
in
yet
at
last
there
is
a
knock
at
the
door
which
he
answers
by
a
somewhat
testy
come
in
but
he
checks
the
coming
grumble
when
not
the
maid
but
lucia
enters
why
not
grumble
at
lucia
he
has
done
so
many
a
time
because
she
looks
this
morning
so
charming
really
quite
pretty
again
so
radiant
is
her
face
with
smiles
and
because
also
she
holds
triumphant
above
her
head
a
newspaper
she
dances
up
to
him
i
have
something
for
you
for
me
why
the
post
has
been
in
this
yes
for
you
and
that
just
the
reason
why
i
kept
it
myself
d
understand
my
irish
reasoning
no
you
pretty
creature
said
elsley
who
saw
that
whatever
the
news
was
it
was
good
news
pretty
creature
am
i
i
was
once
i
know
but
i
thought
you
had
forgotten
all
about
that
but
i
was
not
going
to
let
you
have
the
paper
till
i
had
devoured
every
word
of
it
myself
first
every
word
of
what
of
what
you
sha
have
unless
you
promise
to
be
good
for
a
week
such
a
review
and
from
america
what
a
dear
man
he
must
be
who
wrote
it
i
really
think
i
should
kiss
him
if
i
met
him
and
i
really
think
he
would
not
say
no
but
as
he
not
here
i
shall
act
as
his
proxy
be
quiet
and
read
that
if
you
can
for
blushes
and
she
spread
out
the
paper
before
him
and
then
covered
his
eyes
with
her
hands
no
you
sha
see
it
it
will
make
you
vain
elsley
had
looked
eagerly
at
the
honeyed
columns
as
who
would
not
have
done
but
the
last
word
smote
him
what
was
he
thinking
of
his
own
praise
or
his
wife
love
too
true
he
cried
looking
up
at
her
you
dear
creature
vain
i
am
god
forgive
me
but
before
i
look
at
a
word
of
this
i
must
have
a
talk
with
you
i
ca
stop
i
must
run
back
to
the
children
no
now
do
look
cross
as
his
brow
clouded
i
only
said
that
to
tease
you
stop
with
you
ten
whole
minutes
if
you
wo
look
so
very
solemn
and
important
i
hate
tragedy
faces
now
what
is
it
as
all
this
was
spoken
while
both
her
hands
were
clasped
round
elsley
neck
and
with
looks
and
tones
of
the
very
sweetest
as
well
as
the
very
sauciest
no
offence
was
given
and
none
taken
but
elsley
voice
was
sad
as
he
asked
so
you
really
do
care
for
my
poems
you
great
silly
creature
why
else
did
i
marry
you
at
all
as
if
i
cared
for
anything
in
the
world
but
your
poems
as
if
i
did
not
love
everybody
who
praises
them
and
if
any
stupid
reviewer
dares
to
say
a
word
against
them
i
could
kill
him
on
the
spot
i
care
for
nothing
in
the
world
but
what
people
say
of
and
yet
i
do
care
one
pin
i
know
what
your
poems
are
if
nobody
else
does
and
they
belong
to
me
because
you
belong
to
me
and
i
must
be
the
best
judge
and
care
for
nobody
no
not
i
and
she
began
singing
and
then
hung
over
him
tormenting
him
lovingly
while
he
read
it
was
a
true
american
review
utterly
extravagant
in
its
laudations
whether
from
or
from
a
certain
love
of
exaggeration
and
magniloquence
which
makes
one
suspect
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
transatlantic
gentlemen
of
the
press
must
be
natives
of
the
sister
isle
but
it
was
all
the
more
pleasant
to
the
soul
of
elsley
there
said
lucia
as
she
clung
croodling
to
him
there
is
a
pretty
character
of
you
sir
make
the
most
of
it
for
it
is
all
those
yankees
will
ever
send
you
yes
said
elsley
if
they
would
send
one
a
little
money
instead
of
making
endless
dollars
by
printing
one
books
and
then
a
few
more
by
praising
one
at
a
penny
a
line
that
talking
like
a
man
of
business
if
instead
of
the
review
now
a
cheque
for
fifty
pounds
had
come
how
i
would
have
rushed
out
and
paid
the
bills
and
liked
it
a
great
deal
better
than
the
review
you
jealous
creature
no
if
i
could
always
have
you
praised
live
in
a
cabin
and
go
about
the
world
barefoot
like
a
wild
irish
girl
you
would
make
a
very
charming
one
i
used
to
once
i
can
tell
you
valencia
and
i
used
to
run
about
without
shoes
and
stockings
at
kilanbaggan
and
you
ca
think
how
pretty
and
white
this
little
foot
used
to
look
on
a
nice
soft
carpet
of
green
moss
i
shall
write
a
sonnet
to
it
you
may
if
you
choose
provided
you
do
publish
it
you
may
trust
me
for
that
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
anatomise
their
own
married
happiness
for
the
edification
of
the
whole
public
and
make
fame
if
not
money
out
of
their
own
wives
hearts
how
i
should
hate
you
if
you
did
not
that
i
believe
their
fine
stories
about
themselves
at
least
i
am
certain
it
only
half
the
story
they
have
their
quarrels
my
dear
just
as
you
and
i
have
but
they
take
care
not
to
put
them
into
poetry
well
but
who
could
whether
they
have
a
right
or
not
to
publish
the
poetical
side
of
their
married
life
it
is
too
much
to
ask
them
to
give
you
the
unpoetical
also
then
they
are
all
humbugs
and
i
believe
if
they
really
love
their
wives
so
very
much
they
would
not
be
at
all
that
pains
to
persuade
the
world
of
it
you
are
very
satirical
and
spiteful
i
always
am
when
i
am
pleased
if
i
am
particularly
happy
i
always
long
to
pinch
somebody
i
suppose
it
irish
out
meets
a
friend
and
for
love
knocks
him
down
but
you
know
you
rogue
that
you
care
to
read
no
poetry
but
love
poetry
of
course
not
every
woman
does
but
let
me
find
you
publishing
any
such
about
me
and
see
what
i
will
do
to
you
there
now
i
must
go
to
my
work
and
you
go
and
write
something
extra
superfinely
grand
because
i
have
been
so
good
to
you
no
let
me
go
what
a
bother
you
are
and
away
she
tripped
and
he
returned
to
his
work
happier
than
he
had
been
for
a
week
past
his
happiness
truly
was
only
on
the
surface
the
old
wound
had
been
salved
as
what
wound
can
not
be
by
woman
love
and
woman
wit
but
it
was
not
healed
the
cause
of
his
wrong
doing
the
vain
spirit
was
there
still
unchastened
and
he
was
destined
that
very
day
to
find
that
he
had
still
to
bear
the
punishment
of
it
now
the
reader
must
understand
that
though
one
may
laugh
at
elsley
vavasour
because
it
is
more
pleasant
than
scolding
at
him
yet
have
philistia
and
fogeydom
neither
right
nor
reason
to
consider
him
a
despicable
or
merely
ludicrous
person
or
to
cry
ah
if
he
had
been
as
we
are
had
he
been
merely
ludicrous
lucia
would
never
have
married
him
and
he
could
only
have
been
spoken
of
with
indignation
or
left
utterly
out
of
the
story
as
a
simply
unpleasant
figure
beyond
the
purposes
of
a
novel
though
admissible
now
and
then
into
tragedy
one
can
not
heartily
laugh
at
a
man
if
one
has
not
a
lurking
love
for
him
as
one
really
ought
to
have
for
elsley
how
much
value
is
to
be
attached
to
his
mere
power
of
imagination
and
fancy
and
so
forth
is
a
question
but
there
was
in
him
more
than
mere
talent
there
was
in
thought
at
least
virtue
and
magnanimity
true
the
best
part
of
him
perhaps
almost
all
the
good
part
of
him
spent
itself
in
words
and
must
be
looked
for
not
in
his
life
but
in
his
books
but
in
those
books
it
can
be
found
and
if
you
look
through
them
you
will
see
that
he
has
not
touched
upon
a
subject
without
taking
on
the
whole
the
right
and
pure
and
lofty
view
of
it
howsoever
extravagant
he
may
be
in
his
notions
of
poetic
licence
that
licence
is
never
with
him
a
synonym
for
licentiousness
whatever
is
tender
and
true
whatever
is
chivalrous
and
he
loves
at
first
sight
and
reproduces
it
lovingly
and
it
may
be
possible
that
his
own
estimate
of
his
poems
was
not
altogether
wrong
that
his
words
may
have
awakened
here
and
there
in
others
a
love
for
that
which
is
morally
as
well
as
physically
beautiful
and
may
have
kept
alive
in
their
hearts
the
recollection
that
both
for
the
bodies
and
the
souls
of
men
forms
of
life
far
nobler
and
fairer
than
those
which
we
see
now
are
possible
that
they
have
appeared
in
fragments
at
least
already
on
the
earth
that
they
are
destined
perhaps
to
reappear
and
combine
themselves
in
some
ideal
state
and
in
one
divine
event
toward
which
the
whole
creation
moves
this
is
the
special
and
proper
function
of
the
poet
that
he
may
do
this
does
god
touch
his
lips
with
that
which
however
it
may
be
misused
is
still
fire
from
off
the
altar
beneath
which
the
spirits
of
his
saints
cry
lord
how
long
if
he
reproduce
the
beautiful
with
this
intent
however
so
little
then
is
he
of
the
sacred
guild
and
because
vavasour
had
this
gift
therefore
he
was
a
poet
but
in
this
he
was
weak
that
he
did
not
feel
or
at
least
was
forgetting
fast
that
this
gift
had
been
bestowed
on
him
for
any
practical
purpose
no
one
would
demand
that
he
should
have
gone
forth
with
some
grand
social
scheme
to
reform
a
world
which
looked
to
him
so
mean
and
evil
he
was
not
a
man
of
business
and
was
not
meant
to
be
one
but
it
was
ill
for
him
that
in
his
fastidiousness
and
touchiness
he
had
shut
himself
out
from
that
world
till
he
had
quite
forgotten
how
much
good
there
was
in
it
as
well
as
evil
how
many
people
commonplace
and
unpoetical
it
may
be
but
still
heroical
in
god
sight
were
working
harder
than
he
ever
worked
at
the
divine
drudgery
of
doing
good
and
that
in
dens
of
darkness
and
sloughs
of
filth
from
which
he
would
have
turned
with
disgust
so
that
the
sympathy
with
the
sinful
and
fallen
which
marks
his
earlier
poems
and
which
perhaps
verges
on
sentimentalism
gradually
gives
place
to
a
pharisaic
and
contemptuous
tone
a
tone
more
lofty
and
manful
in
seeming
but
far
less
divine
in
fact
perhaps
comparative
success
had
injured
him
whilst
struggling
himself
against
circumstances
poor
untaught
unhappy
he
had
more
with
those
whom
circumstance
oppressed
at
least
the
pity
which
he
could
once
bestow
upon
the
misery
which
he
met
in
his
daily
walks
he
now
kept
for
the
more
picturesque
woes
of
italy
and
greece
in
this
too
he
was
weak
that
he
had
altogether
forgotten
that
the
fire
from
off
the
altar
could
only
be
kept
alight
by
continual
and
by
continual
gentleness
and
humility
shown
in
the
petty
matters
of
everyday
and
that
he
who
can
not
rule
his
own
household
can
never
rule
the
church
of
god
and
so
it
befell
that
amid
the
little
of
home
squabbles
the
sacred
spark
was
fast
going
out
the
poems
written
after
he
settled
at
penalva
are
marked
by
a
less
definite
purpose
by
a
lower
tone
of
feeling
not
perhaps
by
a
lower
moral
tone
but
simply
by
less
of
any
moral
tone
at
all
they
are
more
and
more
full
of
merely
sensuous
beauty
mere
mere
the
desire
of
finding
something
worth
saying
gives
place
more
and
more
to
that
of
saying
something
in
a
new
fashion
as
the
originality
of
thought
which
accompanies
only
vigorous
moral
purpose
decreases
the
attempt
at
originality
of
language
increases
manner
in
short
has
taken
the
place
of
matter
the
art
it
may
be
of
his
latest
poems
is
greatest
but
it
has
been
expended
on
the
most
unworthy
themes
the
later
are
mannered
caricatures
of
the
earlier
without
their
soul
and
the
same
change
seems
to
have
passed
over
him
which
with
ruskin
pardon
transformed
the
turner
of
into
the
turner
of
thus
had
elsley
transferred
what
sympathy
he
had
left
from
and
ragged
schools
dwellers
in
jacob
island
and
sleepers
in
the
dry
arches
of
waterloo
bridge
to
sufferers
of
a
more
poetic
class
whether
his
sympathies
showed
thereby
that
he
had
risen
or
fallen
let
my
readers
decide
each
for
himself
it
is
a
credit
to
any
man
to
feel
for
any
human
being
and
italy
as
she
is
at
this
moment
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
tragic
spectacles
which
the
world
has
ever
seen
elsley
need
not
be
blamed
for
pitying
her
only
for
holding
with
most
of
our
poets
a
vague
notion
that
her
woes
were
to
be
cured
by
a
hair
of
the
dog
who
bit
her
by
homoeopathic
doses
of
that
same
art
which
has
been
all
along
her
morbid
and
substitute
for
virtue
and
industry
so
as
she
had
sung
herself
down
to
the
nether
pit
elsley
would
help
to
sing
her
up
again
and
had
already
been
throwing
off
ever
since
a
series
of
sonnets
which
he
entitled
eurydice
intimating
of
course
that
he
acted
as
the
orpheus
whether
he
had
hopes
of
drawing
iron
tears
down
pluto
radetzky
cheek
does
not
appear
but
certainly
the
longer
poem
which
had
sprung
from
his
fancy
at
the
urgent
call
of
brown
and
younger
would
have
been
likely
to
draw
nothing
but
iron
balls
from
radetzky
cannon
or
failing
so
vast
an
effect
an
immediate
external
application
to
the
poet
himself
of
that
famous
herb
pantagruelion
cure
for
all
public
ills
and
private
woes
which
men
call
hemp
nevertheless
it
was
a
noble
subject
one
which
ought
surely
to
have
been
taken
up
by
some
of
our
poets
for
if
they
do
not
make
a
noble
poem
of
it
it
will
be
their
own
fault
i
mean
that
sad
and
fantastic
tragedy
of
fra
dolcino
and
margaret
which
signor
mariotti
has
lately
given
to
the
english
public
in
a
book
which
both
for
its
matter
and
its
manner
should
be
better
known
than
it
is
elsley
soul
had
been
filled
it
would
have
been
a
dull
one
else
with
the
conception
of
the
handsome
and
gifted
his
soul
delirious
with
the
dream
of
realising
a
perfect
church
on
earth
battling
with
tongue
and
pen
and
at
last
with
sword
against
the
villanies
of
pope
and
kaiser
and
all
the
old
devourers
of
the
earth
cheered
only
by
the
wild
love
of
her
who
had
given
up
wealth
fame
friends
all
which
render
life
worth
having
to
die
with
him
a
death
too
horrible
for
words
and
he
had
conceived
and
not
altogether
ill
a
vision
in
which
wandering
along
some
bright
italian
bay
he
met
dolcino
sitting
a
spirit
at
rest
but
not
yet
glorified
waiting
for
the
revival
of
that
dead
land
for
which
he
had
died
and
margaret
by
him
dipping
her
scorched
feet
for
ever
in
the
cooling
wave
and
looking
up
to
the
hero
for
whom
she
had
given
up
all
with
eyes
of
everlasting
love
there
they
were
to
prophesy
to
him
such
things
as
seemed
fit
to
him
of
the
future
of
italy
and
of
europe
of
the
doom
of
priests
and
tyrants
of
the
sorrows
and
rewards
of
genius
unappreciated
and
before
its
age
for
elsley
secret
vanity
could
see
in
himself
a
far
greater
likeness
to
dolcino
than
dolcino
the
preacher
confessor
bender
of
all
hearts
man
of
the
world
and
man
of
action
at
last
crafty
and
all
but
unconquerable
guerilla
warrior
would
ever
have
acknowledged
in
the
dreamer
however
it
was
a
fair
conception
enough
though
perhaps
it
never
would
have
entered
elsley
head
had
shelley
never
written
the
opening
canto
of
the
revolt
of
islam
so
elsley
on
a
burning
july
forenoon
strolled
up
the
lane
and
over
the
down
to
king
arthur
nose
that
he
might
find
materials
for
his
scene
for
he
was
not
one
of
those
men
who
live
in
such
quiet
everyday
communication
with
nature
that
they
drink
in
her
various
aspects
as
unconsciously
as
the
air
they
breathe
and
so
can
reproduce
them
out
of
an
inexhaustible
stock
of
details
simply
and
accurately
and
yet
freshly
too
tinged
by
the
peculiar
hue
of
the
mind
in
which
they
have
been
long
sleeping
he
walked
the
world
either
blind
to
the
beauty
round
him
and
trying
to
compose
instead
some
little
scrap
of
beauty
in
his
own
thoughts
or
else
he
was
looking
out
consciously
and
spasmodically
for
views
effects
emotions
images
something
striking
and
uncommon
which
would
suggest
a
poetic
figure
or
help
out
a
description
or
in
some
way
his
mind
with
thought
from
which
method
it
befell
that
his
lamp
of
truth
was
too
often
burnt
out
just
when
it
was
needed
and
that
like
the
foolish
virgins
he
had
to
go
and
buy
oil
when
it
was
too
late
or
failing
that
to
supply
its
place
with
some
baser
artificial
material
that
day
however
he
was
fortunate
enough
for
wandering
and
scrambling
among
the
rocks
at
a
dead
low
spring
tide
he
came
upon
a
spot
which
would
have
made
a
poem
of
itself
better
than
all
elsley
ever
wrote
had
he
forgetting
all
about
fra
dolcino
italy
priests
and
tyrants
set
down
in
black
and
white
just
what
he
saw
provided
of
course
that
he
had
patience
first
to
see
the
same
it
was
none
other
than
that
ghastly
chasm
across
which
thurnall
had
been
so
miraculously
swept
on
the
night
of
his
shipwreck
the
same
ghastly
chasm
but
ghastly
now
no
longer
and
as
elsley
looked
down
the
beauty
below
invited
him
and
the
coolness
also
for
the
sun
beat
on
the
flat
rock
above
till
it
scorched
the
feet
and
dazzled
the
eye
and
crisped
up
the
blackening
while
every
crept
to
hide
itself
under
the
and
nothing
dared
to
peep
or
stir
save
certain
grains
of
gunpowder
which
seemed
to
have
gone
mad
so
merrily
did
they
hop
about
upon
the
surface
of
the
fast
evaporating
that
wonder
indeed
elsley
stooped
to
examine
and
drew
back
his
hands
with
an
ugh
and
a
gesture
of
disgust
when
he
found
that
they
were
nasty
little
insects
for
elsley
held
fully
the
poet
right
to
believe
that
all
things
are
not
very
good
none
indeed
save
such
as
suited
his
eclectic
and
fastidious
taste
and
to
hold
on
high
aesthetic
grounds
of
course
toads
and
spiders
in
as
much
abhorrence
as
does
any
girl
however
finding
some
rock
ledges
which
formed
a
natural
ladder
down
he
scrambled
gingerly
enough
for
he
was
neither
an
active
nor
a
courageous
man
but
once
down
i
will
do
him
the
justice
to
say
that
for
five
whole
minutes
he
forgot
all
about
fra
dolcino
and
what
was
better
about
himself
also
the
chasm
may
have
been
fifteen
feet
deep
and
above
about
half
that
breadth
but
below
the
waves
had
hollowed
it
into
dark
overhanging
caverns
just
in
front
of
him
a
huge
boulder
spanned
the
crack
and
formed
a
natural
doorway
through
which
he
saw
like
a
picture
set
in
a
frame
the
blue
sea
softening
into
the
blue
sky
among
brown
eastern
haze
amid
the
haze
a
single
ship
hung
motionless
like
a
white
cloud
nearer
a
black
cormorant
floated
sleepily
along
and
dived
and
rose
again
nearer
again
long
lines
of
flat
glittering
and
quivering
in
the
heat
sloped
gradually
under
the
waves
till
they
ended
in
beds
of
olive
which
bent
their
tangled
stems
into
a
hundred
graceful
curves
and
swayed
to
and
fro
slowly
and
sleepily
the
low
swell
slid
whispering
among
their
floating
palms
and
slipped
on
toward
the
cavern
mouth
as
if
asking
wistfully
so
elsley
fancied
when
it
would
be
time
for
it
to
return
to
that
cool
shade
and
hide
from
all
the
blinding
blaze
outside
but
when
his
eye
was
enough
accustomed
to
the
shade
within
it
withdrew
gladly
from
the
glaring
sea
and
glaring
to
the
walls
of
the
chasm
itself
to
curved
and
polished
sheets
of
stone
rich
brown
with
veins
on
which
danced
for
ever
a
dappled
network
of
pale
yellow
light
to
crusted
beds
of
pink
coralline
to
caverns
in
the
dark
crannies
of
which
hung
branching
sponges
and
tufts
of
purple
to
strips
of
clear
white
sand
bestrewn
with
shells
to
pools
each
a
gay
of
all
hues
where
branching
reflected
blue
light
from
every
point
like
a
thousand
damasked
while
among
them
dahlias
and
chrysanthemums
and
many
another
mimic
of
our
flowers
spread
blooms
of
crimson
and
purple
and
lilac
and
creamy
grey
among
feathered
weeds
as
brightly
coloured
as
they
and
strange
and
gaudy
fishes
shot
across
from
side
to
side
and
chased
each
other
in
and
out
of
hidden
cells
within
and
without
all
was
at
rest
the
silence
was
broken
only
by
the
timid
whisper
of
the
swell
and
by
the
chime
of
dropping
water
within
some
unseen
cave
but
what
a
different
rest
without
all
lying
breathless
stupefied
in
blinding
glare
within
all
coolness
and
refreshing
sleep
without
all
simple
broad
and
vast
within
all
various
with
infinite
richness
of
form
and
an
hairoun
alraschid
bower
looking
out
upon
the
bother
the
fellow
why
will
he
go
on
analysing
and
figuring
in
this
way
why
not
let
the
blessed
place
tell
him
what
it
means
instead
of
telling
it
what
he
thinks
and
why
he
is
actually
writing
verses
though
not
about
fra
dolcino
how
rests
yon
rock
whoso
bath
is
done
with
broad
bright
sight
beneath
the
broad
bright
sun
like
tired
on
cushioned
mosses
sleeping
yet
nearer
drawn
beneath
her
purple
tresses
from
brows
we
find
her
slowly
weeping
so
many
a
heart
for
cruel
man
caresses
must
only
pine
and
pine
and
yet
must
bear
a
gallant
front
beneath
life
gaudy
glare
silly
fellow
do
you
think
that
nature
had
time
to
think
of
such
a
conceit
as
that
while
it
was
making
that
rock
and
peopling
it
with
a
million
tiny
living
things
of
which
not
one
falleth
to
the
ground
without
your
father
knowledge
and
each
more
beautiful
than
any
whom
you
ever
fancied
for
after
all
you
can
not
fancy
a
whole
sea
nymph
perhaps
in
that
case
you
could
make
one
but
only
a
very
little
scrap
of
her
outside
or
if
as
you
boast
you
are
inspired
by
the
creative
spirit
tell
us
what
the
creative
spirit
says
about
that
rock
and
not
such
verse
as
that
the
lesson
of
which
you
do
yourself
really
feel
pretty
enough
it
is
perhaps
but
in
your
haste
to
say
a
pretty
thing
just
because
it
was
pretty
you
have
not
cared
to
condemn
yourself
out
of
your
own
mouth
why
were
you
sulky
sir
with
vavasour
this
very
morning
after
all
that
passed
because
she
would
look
over
the
while
you
wanted
her
to
hear
about
fra
dolcino
and
why
though
she
was
up
to
her
knees
among
your
dirty
shirts
when
you
went
out
did
you
not
give
her
one
parting
kiss
which
would
have
transfigured
her
virtuous
drudgery
for
her
into
a
sacred
pleasure
one
is
heartily
glad
to
see
you
disturbed
cross
though
you
may
look
at
it
by
that
sturdy
step
and
jolly
whistle
which
burst
in
on
you
from
the
other
end
of
the
chasm
as
tom
thurnall
with
an
old
smock
frock
over
his
coat
and
a
large
basket
on
his
arm
comes
stumbling
and
hopping
towards
you
dropping
every
now
and
then
on
hands
and
knees
and
turning
over
on
his
back
to
squeeze
his
head
into
some
muddy
crack
and
then
withdraw
it
with
the
salt
water
dripping
down
his
nose
elsley
closed
his
eyes
and
rested
his
head
on
his
hand
in
a
somewhat
studied
pose
but
as
he
wished
not
to
be
interrupted
it
may
not
have
been
altogether
unpardonable
to
pretend
sleep
however
the
sleeping
posture
had
exactly
the
opposite
effect
to
that
which
he
designed
ah
mr
vavasour
humph
quoth
he
slowly
if
not
sulkily
i
admire
your
taste
sir
a
charming
summerhouse
old
triton
has
vacated
for
your
use
but
let
me
advise
you
not
to
go
to
sleep
in
it
why
then
sir
because
it
no
business
of
mine
of
course
but
the
tide
has
turned
already
and
if
a
breeze
springs
up
old
triton
will
be
back
again
in
a
hurry
and
in
a
rage
also
and
i
may
possibly
lose
a
good
patient
elsley
who
knew
nothing
about
the
tides
save
that
the
moon
wooed
the
ocean
or
some
such
important
fact
thanked
him
coolly
enough
and
returned
to
a
meditative
attitude
tom
saw
that
he
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
and
went
on
but
he
had
not
gone
three
steps
before
he
pulled
up
short
slapping
his
hands
together
once
as
a
man
does
who
has
found
what
he
wants
and
then
plunged
up
to
his
knees
in
a
rock
pool
and
then
began
working
very
gently
at
something
under
water
elsley
watched
him
for
full
five
minutes
with
so
much
curiosity
that
despite
of
himself
he
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
tom
had
his
whole
face
under
water
and
did
not
hear
till
elsley
had
repeated
the
question
only
a
rare
zoophyte
said
he
at
last
lifting
his
dripping
visage
and
gasping
for
breath
and
then
he
dived
again
inexplicable
pedantry
of
science
thought
elsley
to
himself
while
tom
worked
on
steadfastly
and
at
last
rose
and
taking
out
a
phial
from
his
basket
was
about
to
deposit
in
it
something
invisible
stay
a
moment
you
really
have
roused
my
curiosity
by
your
earnestness
may
i
see
what
it
is
for
which
you
have
taken
so
much
trouble
tom
held
out
on
his
finger
a
piece
of
slimy
crust
the
size
of
a
halfpenny
elsley
could
only
shrug
his
shoulders
nothing
to
you
sir
i
doubt
not
but
worth
a
guinea
to
me
even
if
it
be
only
to
mount
bits
of
it
as
microscopic
objects
so
you
mingle
business
with
science
said
elsley
rather
in
a
contemptuous
tone
why
not
i
must
live
and
my
father
too
and
it
is
as
honest
a
way
of
making
money
as
any
other
i
poach
in
no
man
manor
for
my
game
but
what
is
your
game
what
possible
attraction
in
that
bit
of
dirt
can
make
men
spend
their
money
on
it
you
shall
see
said
tom
dropping
it
into
the
phial
of
salt
water
and
offering
it
to
elsley
with
his
pocket
magnifier
judge
for
yourself
elsley
did
so
and
beheld
a
new
wonder
a
living
plant
of
crystal
studded
with
crystal
bells
from
each
of
which
waved
a
crown
of
delicate
arms
it
was
the
first
time
that
elsley
had
ever
seen
one
of
those
exquisite
zoophytes
which
stud
every
rock
and
every
tuft
of
weed
this
is
most
beautiful
said
he
at
length
humph
why
should
not
vavasour
write
a
poem
about
it
why
not
indeed
thought
elsley
it
no
business
of
mine
no
man
less
but
i
often
wonder
why
you
poets
do
take
to
the
microscope
and
tell
us
a
little
more
about
the
wonderful
things
which
are
here
already
and
not
about
those
which
are
not
and
which
perhaps
never
will
be
well
said
elsley
after
another
look
but
after
all
these
things
have
no
human
interest
in
them
i
do
know
that
they
have
to
me
for
instance
these
are
the
things
which
i
would
write
about
if
i
had
any
turn
for
verse
not
about
human
nature
of
which
i
know
i
afraid
a
little
too
much
already
i
always
like
to
read
old
darwin
of
the
plants
bosh
as
it
is
in
a
scientific
point
of
view
it
amuses
one
fancy
without
making
one
lose
one
temper
as
one
must
when
one
begins
to
analyse
the
microscopic
ape
called
self
and
friends
you
would
like
then
the
old
cosmogonies
the
eddas
and
the
vedas
said
elsley
getting
interested
as
most
people
did
after
five
minutes
talk
with
the
cynical
doctor
i
suppose
you
would
not
say
much
for
their
science
but
as
poetry
they
are
just
what
you
ask
for
the
expression
of
thoughtful
spirits
who
looked
round
upon
nature
with
childlike
eyes
and
asked
of
all
heaven
and
earth
the
question
are
you
how
came
you
to
be
yet
it
may
be
my
fault
while
i
admire
them
i
can
not
sympathise
with
them
to
me
this
zoophyte
is
as
a
being
of
another
sphere
and
till
i
can
create
some
link
in
my
own
mind
between
it
and
humanity
it
is
as
nothing
in
my
eyes
there
is
link
enough
sir
do
doubt
and
chains
of
iron
and
brass
too
you
believe
then
in
the
development
theory
of
the
doctors
who
have
their
bread
to
earn
never
commit
themselves
to
theories
no
all
i
meant
was
that
this
little
zoophyte
lives
by
the
same
laws
as
you
and
i
and
that
he
and
the
and
so
forth
teach
us
doctors
certain
little
rules
concerning
life
and
death
which
you
will
have
a
chance
soon
of
seeing
at
work
on
the
most
grand
and
poetical
and
indeed
altogether
tragic
scale
what
do
you
mean
when
the
cholera
comes
here
as
it
will
at
its
present
pace
before
the
end
of
the
summer
then
i
shall
have
the
zoophytes
rising
up
in
judgment
against
me
if
i
have
not
profited
by
a
leaf
out
of
their
book
the
cholera
said
elsley
in
a
startled
voice
forgetting
parables
in
the
new
thought
for
elsley
had
a
dread
more
nervous
than
really
coward
of
infectious
diseases
and
he
had
also
and
prided
himself
too
on
having
all
goethe
dislike
of
anything
terrible
or
horrible
of
sickness
disease
wounds
death
anything
which
jarred
with
that
beautiful
which
was
his
idol
the
cholera
repeated
he
i
hope
not
i
wish
you
had
not
mentioned
it
mr
thurnall
i
am
very
sorry
that
i
did
so
if
it
offends
you
i
had
thought
that
forewarned
was
forearmed
after
all
it
is
no
business
of
mine
if
i
have
extra
labour
as
i
shall
have
i
shall
have
extra
experience
and
that
will
be
a
fair
even
if
the
board
of
guardians
do
vote
me
an
extra
remuneration
as
they
ought
to
do
elsley
was
struck
dumb
first
by
the
certainty
which
tom
words
expressed
and
next
by
the
coolness
of
their
temper
at
last
he
stammered
out
good
heavens
thurnall
you
do
not
talk
of
that
frightful
scourge
so
disgusting
too
in
its
character
as
a
matter
of
profit
and
loss
it
is
sordid
my
dear
sir
if
i
let
myself
think
much
more
talk
about
the
matter
in
any
other
tone
i
should
face
the
thing
poorly
enough
when
it
came
i
shall
have
work
enough
to
keep
my
head
about
the
end
of
august
or
beginning
of
september
and
i
must
not
lose
it
beforehand
by
indulging
in
any
horror
disgust
or
other
emotion
perfectly
justifiable
in
a
layman
but
are
not
doctors
men
that
depends
very
much
on
what
man
means
men
with
human
sympathy
and
compassion
oh
i
mean
by
a
man
a
man
with
human
strength
my
dear
sir
one
may
be
too
busy
and
at
doing
good
too
though
that
is
not
my
line
save
professionally
because
it
is
my
only
way
of
earning
money
but
one
may
be
too
busy
at
doing
good
to
have
time
for
compassion
if
while
i
was
cutting
a
man
leg
off
i
thought
of
the
pain
which
he
was
suffering
thank
heaven
said
elsley
that
it
was
not
my
lot
to
become
a
medical
man
tom
looked
at
him
with
the
quaintest
smile
a
flush
of
mingled
anger
and
contempt
had
been
rising
in
him
as
he
heard
the
talking
sentiment
but
he
only
went
on
quietly
no
sir
with
your
more
delicate
sensibilities
you
may
thank
heaven
that
you
did
not
become
a
medical
man
your
life
would
have
been
one
of
torture
disgust
and
agonising
sense
of
responsibility
but
do
you
not
see
that
you
must
thank
heaven
for
the
sufferer
sake
also
i
will
not
shock
you
again
by
talking
of
amputation
but
even
in
the
smallest
matter
even
if
you
were
merely
sending
medicine
to
an
old
maid
suppose
that
your
imagination
were
preoccupied
by
the
thought
of
her
old
age
her
sufferings
her
disappointed
hopes
her
regretful
dream
of
bygone
youth
and
beauty
and
love
and
all
the
tender
fancies
which
might
well
spring
out
of
such
a
mournful
spectacle
would
you
not
be
but
too
likely
pardon
the
bathos
to
end
by
sending
her
an
elderly
gentleman
medicine
after
all
and
so
either
frightfully
increasing
her
sufferings
or
ending
them
once
for
all
tom
said
this
in
the
most
quiet
and
natural
tone
without
even
a
twinkle
of
his
wicked
eye
but
elsley
heard
him
begin
with
reddening
face
and
as
he
went
on
the
red
had
turned
to
purple
and
then
to
deadly
yellow
till
making
a
forward
he
cried
fiercely
sir
and
then
stopped
suddenly
for
his
feet
slipped
upon
the
polished
stone
and
on
his
face
he
fell
into
the
pool
at
feet
well
for
both
of
us
geese
said
tom
inwardly
as
he
went
to
pick
him
up
i
verily
believe
he
was
going
to
strike
me
and
that
would
have
done
for
neither
of
us
i
was
a
fool
to
say
it
but
the
temptation
was
so
exquisite
and
it
must
have
come
some
day
but
vavasour
staggered
up
of
his
own
accord
and
dashing
away
proffered
hand
was
rushing
off
without
a
word
not
so
john
briggs
said
tom
making
up
his
mind
in
a
moment
that
he
must
have
it
out
now
or
never
and
that
he
might
have
everything
to
fear
from
vavasour
if
he
let
him
go
home
furious
we
do
not
part
thus
sir
we
will
meet
again
if
you
will
foamed
vavasour
but
it
shall
end
in
the
death
of
one
of
us
by
each
other
potions
i
can
doctor
myself
sir
thank
you
listen
to
me
john
briggs
you
shall
listen
and
tom
sprang
past
him
and
planted
himself
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
steps
to
prevent
his
escaping
upward
what
do
you
wish
to
quarrel
with
me
sir
it
is
i
who
ought
to
quarrel
with
you
i
am
the
aggrieved
party
and
not
you
sir
i
have
not
seen
the
son
of
the
man
who
when
i
was
an
apothecary
boy
petted
me
lent
me
books
introduced
me
as
a
genius
turned
my
head
for
me
which
was
just
what
i
was
vain
enough
to
enjoy
i
have
not
seen
that
man
son
cast
ashore
penniless
and
friendless
and
yet
never
held
out
to
him
a
helping
hand
but
tried
to
conceal
my
identity
from
him
from
a
dirty
shame
of
my
honest
father
honest
name
vavasour
dropped
his
eyes
for
was
it
not
true
but
he
raised
them
again
more
fiercely
than
ever
curse
you
i
owe
you
nothing
it
was
you
who
made
me
ashamed
of
it
you
rhymed
on
it
and
laughed
about
poetry
coming
out
of
such
a
name
and
what
if
i
did
are
poets
to
be
made
of
nothing
but
tinder
and
gall
why
could
you
not
take
an
honest
joke
as
it
was
meant
and
go
your
way
like
other
people
till
you
had
shown
yourself
worth
something
and
won
honour
even
for
the
name
of
briggs
and
i
have
i
have
my
own
station
now
my
own
fame
sir
and
it
is
nothing
to
you
what
i
choose
to
call
myself
i
have
won
my
place
i
say
and
your
mean
envy
can
not
rob
me
of
it
you
have
your
station
very
good
said
tom
not
caring
to
notice
the
imputation
you
owe
the
greater
part
of
it
to
your
having
made
a
most
fortunate
marriage
for
which
i
respect
you
as
a
practical
man
let
your
poetry
be
what
it
may
and
people
tell
me
that
it
is
really
very
beautiful
your
match
shows
me
that
you
are
a
clever
and
therefore
a
successful
person
do
you
take
me
for
a
sordid
schemer
like
yourself
i
loved
what
was
worthy
of
me
and
won
it
because
i
deserved
it
then
having
won
it
treat
it
as
it
deserves
said
tom
with
a
cool
searching
look
before
which
vavasour
eyes
fell
again
understand
me
john
briggs
it
is
of
no
consequence
to
me
what
you
call
yourself
but
it
is
of
consequence
to
me
that
i
should
not
have
a
patient
in
my
parish
whom
i
can
not
cure
for
i
can
not
cure
broken
hearts
though
they
will
be
simple
enough
to
come
to
me
for
medicine
you
shall
have
no
chance
you
shall
never
enter
my
house
you
shall
not
ruin
me
sir
by
your
bills
tom
made
no
answer
to
this
fresh
insult
he
had
another
game
to
play
take
care
what
you
say
briggs
remember
that
after
all
you
are
in
my
power
and
i
had
better
remind
you
plainly
of
the
fact
and
you
mean
to
make
me
your
tool
i
will
die
first
i
believe
that
said
tom
who
was
very
near
adding
that
he
should
be
sorry
to
work
with
such
tools
my
tools
are
my
lancet
and
my
drugs
said
he
quietly
and
all
i
have
to
say
refers
to
them
it
suits
my
purpose
to
become
the
principal
medical
man
in
this
neighbourhood
and
i
am
to
tout
for
introductions
for
you
you
are
to
be
so
very
kind
as
to
allow
me
to
finish
my
sentence
just
as
you
would
allow
any
other
gentleman
and
because
i
wish
for
practice
and
patients
and
power
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
treat
me
henceforth
as
one
man
would
treat
another
to
whom
he
is
obliged
for
you
know
john
briggs
as
well
as
i
said
tom
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
look
me
in
the
face
if
you
can
ere
you
deny
it
that
i
was
while
you
knew
me
as
honourable
a
man
and
as
a
man
as
you
ever
were
and
that
now
considering
the
circumstances
under
which
we
meet
you
have
more
reason
to
trust
me
than
i
have
prima
facie
to
trust
you
vavasour
answered
not
a
word
then
said
tom
drawing
aside
from
the
step
vavasour
will
be
anxious
about
you
and
mind
with
regard
to
her
first
of
all
sir
and
then
with
regard
to
other
matters
as
long
and
only
as
long
as
you
remember
that
you
are
john
briggs
of
whitbury
i
shall
be
the
first
to
forget
it
there
is
my
hand
for
old
sake
vavasour
took
the
proffered
hand
coldly
paused
a
moment
and
then
wrung
it
in
silence
and
hurried
away
home
have
i
played
my
ace
ill
after
all
said
tom
sitting
down
to
consider
as
for
whether
i
should
have
played
it
all
that
no
business
of
mine
now
madam
may
see
to
that
but
did
i
play
ill
for
if
i
did
i
may
try
a
new
lead
yet
ought
i
to
have
twitted
him
about
his
wife
if
he
venomous
it
may
only
make
matters
worse
and
still
worse
if
he
be
suspicious
i
do
think
he
was
either
in
old
times
but
vanity
will
make
a
man
so
and
it
may
have
made
him
well
i
must
only
ingratiate
myself
all
the
more
with
her
and
find
out
too
whether
she
has
his
secret
as
well
as
i
what
i
am
most
afraid
of
is
my
having
told
him
plainly
that
he
was
in
my
power
it
apt
to
make
sprats
of
his
size
flounce
desperately
in
the
mere
hope
of
proving
themselves
whales
after
all
if
it
only
to
their
miserable
selves
never
mind
he
ca
break
my
tackle
and
besides
that
gripe
of
the
hand
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
poor
wretch
was
beat
and
thought
himself
let
off
easily
as
indeed
he
is
we
hope
so
now
zoophytes
for
another
turn
with
you
to
tell
the
truth
however
tom
is
looking
for
more
than
zoophytes
and
has
been
doing
so
at
every
dead
low
tide
since
he
was
wrecked
he
has
heard
nothing
yet
of
his
belt
the
notes
have
not
been
presented
at
the
london
bank
nobody
in
the
village
has
been
spending
more
money
than
usual
for
cunning
tom
has
contrived
already
to
know
how
many
pints
of
ale
every
man
of
whom
he
has
the
least
doubt
has
drunk
perhaps
after
all
the
belt
may
have
been
torn
off
in
the
life
struggle
it
may
have
been
for
a
moment
in
grace
hands
and
then
have
been
swept
into
the
sea
what
more
likely
and
what
more
likely
in
that
case
that
sinking
by
its
weight
it
is
wedged
away
in
some
cranny
of
the
rocks
so
after
tom
searches
and
all
the
more
carefully
because
others
are
searching
too
for
waifs
and
strays
from
the
wreck
sad
relics
of
mortality
he
finds
at
times
as
others
do
once
even
a
full
of
rings
and
pins
and
chains
which
belonged
he
fancied
to
a
gay
young
bride
with
whom
he
had
waltzed
many
a
time
on
deck
as
they
slipped
along
before
the
soft
but
no
belt
he
sent
the
to
the
lloyd
underwriters
and
searched
on
but
in
vain
neither
could
he
find
that
any
one
else
had
forestalled
him
and
that
very
afternoon
sulky
and
disheartened
he
determined
to
waste
no
more
time
about
the
matter
and
strode
home
vowing
signal
vengeance
against
the
thief
if
he
caught
him
and
i
will
catch
him
these
yokels
to
fancy
that
they
can
do
tom
thurnall
it
adding
insult
to
injury
as
sam
parrot
has
it
now
his
shortest
way
home
lay
across
the
shore
and
then
along
the
beach
and
up
the
steps
by
the
little
waterfall
past
door
and
at
that
door
sat
grace
sewing
in
the
sun
she
looked
up
and
bowed
as
his
passed
smiling
modestly
and
little
dreaming
of
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
and
when
a
very
lovely
girl
smiled
and
bowed
to
tom
he
must
needs
do
the
same
to
her
whereon
she
added
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
have
you
heard
anything
of
the
money
you
lost
i
we
have
been
so
ashamed
to
think
of
such
a
thing
happening
here
tom
evil
spirit
was
roused
have
heard
anything
of
it
miss
harvey
for
you
seem
to
me
the
only
person
in
the
place
who
knows
anything
about
the
matter
i
sir
cried
grace
fixing
her
great
startled
eyes
full
on
him
why
said
tom
with
a
courtly
smile
you
may
possibly
recollect
if
you
will
so
far
tax
your
memory
that
you
had
it
in
your
hands
at
least
a
moment
when
you
did
me
the
kindness
to
save
my
life
and
as
you
were
kind
enough
to
inform
me
that
i
should
recover
it
when
i
was
worthy
of
it
i
suppose
i
have
not
yet
risen
in
your
eyes
to
the
required
state
of
conversion
and
regeneration
and
swinging
impatiently
away
he
walked
on
really
afraid
lest
he
should
say
something
rude
grace
half
called
after
him
and
then
suddenly
checking
herself
rushed
in
to
her
mother
with
a
wild
and
pale
face
what
is
this
thurnall
has
been
saying
to
me
about
his
belt
and
money
which
he
lost
about
what
has
he
been
rude
to
you
the
bad
man
cried
harvey
dropping
the
in
some
confusion
and
taking
a
long
while
to
pick
up
the
pieces
about
the
belt
the
money
which
he
lost
why
do
you
speak
mother
belt
money
ah
i
recollect
now
he
has
lost
some
money
he
says
of
course
he
has
how
should
you
know
anything
i
recollect
there
was
some
talk
of
it
though
but
what
matter
what
he
says
he
was
quite
passed
away
swear
when
they
carried
him
up
but
mother
mother
he
says
that
i
know
about
it
that
i
had
it
in
my
hands
you
oh
the
wicked
wretch
the
false
ungrateful
slanderous
child
of
wrath
with
adder
poison
tinder
his
lips
no
my
child
though
poor
we
honest
let
him
slander
us
rob
us
of
our
good
name
send
us
to
prison
if
he
will
he
can
not
rob
us
of
our
souls
we
be
silent
we
turn
the
other
cheek
and
commit
our
cause
to
one
above
who
pleads
for
the
orphan
and
the
widow
we
will
not
strive
nor
cry
my
child
oh
no
and
harvey
began
fussing
over
the
smashed
i
shall
not
strive
nor
cry
mother
said
grace
who
had
recovered
her
usual
calm
but
he
must
have
some
cause
for
these
strange
words
do
you
recollect
seeing
me
with
the
belt
belt
what
a
belt
i
know
nothing
about
belts
i
tell
you
he
a
villain
and
a
slanderer
oh
that
it
should
have
come
to
this
to
have
my
child
fair
fame
blasted
by
a
wretch
that
comes
nobody
knows
where
from
and
has
been
doing
nobody
knows
what
for
aught
i
know
mother
mother
we
know
no
harm
of
him
if
he
is
mistaken
god
forgive
him
if
he
is
mistaken
went
on
harvey
still
over
the
but
grace
gave
her
no
answer
she
was
deep
in
thought
she
recollected
now
that
as
she
had
gone
up
the
path
from
the
cove
on
that
eventful
morning
she
had
seen
willis
and
thurnall
whispering
earnestly
together
and
she
recollected
now
for
the
first
time
that
there
had
been
a
certain
sadness
and
perplexity
almost
reserve
about
willis
ever
since
good
heavens
could
he
suspect
her
too
she
would
find
out
that
at
least
and
no
sooner
had
her
mother
fussed
away
talking
angrily
to
herself
into
the
back
kitchen
than
grace
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
went
forth
to
find
the
captain
in
an
hour
she
returned
her
lips
were
firm
set
her
cheeks
pale
her
eyes
red
with
weeping
she
said
nothing
to
her
mother
who
for
her
part
did
not
seem
inclined
to
allude
again
to
the
matter
where
have
you
been
child
you
look
quite
poorly
and
your
eyes
red
the
wind
is
very
cold
mother
said
she
and
went
into
her
room
her
mother
looked
sharply
after
her
and
muttered
to
herself
grace
went
in
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
what
a
coldness
this
is
at
my
heart
she
said
aloud
to
herself
trying
to
smile
but
she
could
not
and
she
sat
on
the
bedside
without
taking
off
her
bonnet
and
shawl
her
hands
hanging
listlessly
by
her
side
her
head
drooping
on
her
bosom
till
her
mother
called
her
to
tea
then
she
was
forced
to
rouse
herself
and
went
out
composed
but
utterly
wretched
tom
walked
up
homeward
very
ill
at
ease
he
had
played
to
use
his
nomenclature
two
trump
cards
running
and
was
by
no
means
satisfied
that
he
had
played
them
well
he
had
no
right
certainly
to
be
satisfied
with
either
move
for
both
had
been
made
in
a
somewhat
evil
spirit
and
certainly
for
no
very
disinterested
end
that
was
a
view
of
the
matter
however
which
never
entered
his
mind
there
was
only
that
general
dissatisfaction
with
himself
which
is
though
men
try
hard
to
deny
the
fact
none
other
than
the
supernatural
sting
of
conscience
he
tried
to
lay
to
his
soul
the
flattering
unction
that
he
might
after
all
be
of
use
to
vavasour
by
using
his
power
over
her
husband
but
he
knew
in
his
secret
heart
that
any
move
of
his
in
that
direction
was
likely
only
to
make
matters
worse
that
explosion
might
only
have
sent
home
the
hapless
vavasour
in
a
more
irritable
temper
than
ever
and
thinking
over
many
things
backward
and
forward
he
saw
his
own
way
so
little
that
he
actually
condescended
to
go
and
pump
frank
headley
so
he
termed
it
but
after
all
it
was
only
like
asking
advice
of
a
good
man
because
he
did
not
feel
himself
quite
good
enough
to
advise
himself
the
curate
was
preparing
to
sally
forth
after
his
frugal
dinner
the
morning
he
spent
at
the
schools
or
in
parish
secularities
the
afternoon
till
dusk
was
devoted
to
visiting
the
poor
the
night
not
to
sleep
but
to
reading
and
sermon
writing
thus
by
sitting
up
till
two
in
the
morning
and
rising
again
at
six
for
his
private
devotions
before
walking
a
mile
and
a
half
up
to
church
for
the
morning
service
frank
headley
burnt
the
candle
of
life
at
both
ends
very
effectually
and
showed
that
he
did
so
by
his
pale
cheeks
and
red
eyes
ah
said
tom
as
he
entered
as
usual
poor
nature
is
being
robbed
and
murdered
by
rich
grace
what
do
you
mean
now
asked
frank
smiling
for
he
had
become
accustomed
enough
to
tom
quaint
parables
though
he
had
to
scold
him
often
enough
for
their
irreverence
nature
says
dinner
sit
awhile
and
even
the
dumb
animals
hear
her
voice
and
lie
by
for
a
siesta
when
their
stomachs
are
full
grace
says
up
and
rush
out
the
moment
you
have
swallowed
your
food
and
if
you
get
an
indigestion
abuse
poor
nature
for
it
and
lay
the
blame
on
adam
fall
you
are
irreverent
my
good
sir
as
usual
but
you
are
unjust
also
this
time
how
then
unjust
to
grace
as
you
phrase
it
answered
frank
with
a
quaint
sad
smile
i
assure
you
on
my
honour
that
grace
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
my
out
just
now
but
simply
the
desire
to
do
my
good
works
that
they
may
be
seen
of
men
i
hate
going
out
i
should
like
to
sit
and
read
the
whole
afternoon
but
i
am
afraid
lest
the
dissenters
should
say
has
not
been
to
see
for
the
last
three
days
so
off
i
go
and
no
credit
to
me
why
had
frank
dared
upon
a
month
acquaintance
to
lay
bare
his
own
heart
thus
to
a
man
of
no
creed
at
all
because
i
suppose
amid
all
differences
he
had
found
one
point
of
likeness
between
himself
and
thurnall
he
had
found
that
tom
at
heart
was
a
truly
genuine
man
sincere
and
faithful
to
his
own
scheme
of
the
universe
how
that
man
through
all
his
eventful
life
had
been
enabled
to
bate
not
a
jot
of
heart
or
hope
but
steer
right
onward
was
a
problem
which
frank
longed
curiously
and
yet
fearfully
withal
to
solve
there
were
many
qualities
in
him
which
frank
could
not
but
admire
and
long
to
imitate
and
whence
had
they
come
was
another
problem
at
which
he
looked
trembling
as
many
a
new
thought
crossed
him
he
longed
too
to
learn
from
tom
somewhat
at
least
of
that
savoir
faire
that
power
of
becoming
all
things
to
all
men
which
paul
had
and
for
want
of
which
frank
had
failed
he
saw
too
with
surprise
that
tom
had
gained
in
one
month
more
real
insight
into
the
characters
of
his
parishioners
than
he
had
done
in
twelve
and
besides
all
there
was
the
craving
of
the
lonely
heart
for
human
confidence
and
friendship
so
it
befell
that
frank
spoke
out
his
inmost
thought
that
day
and
thought
no
shame
and
it
befell
also
that
thurnall
when
he
heard
it
said
in
his
heart
what
a
noble
honest
fellow
you
are
when
you
but
he
answered
enigmatically
oh
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
grace
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
only
referred
it
to
that
source
because
i
thought
you
would
do
so
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
your
dishonesty
then
i
know
it
but
my
view
of
the
case
is
that
you
rush
out
after
dinner
for
the
very
same
reason
that
the
yankee
storekeeper
does
from
you
forgive
me
if
i
say
it
of
course
you
can
not
speak
too
plainly
to
me
conceit
the
yankee
fancies
himself
such
an
important
person
that
the
commercial
world
will
stand
still
unless
he
flies
back
to
its
help
after
ten
minutes
gobbling
with
his
month
full
of
pork
and
pickled
peaches
and
you
fancy
yourself
so
important
in
your
line
that
the
spiritual
world
will
stand
still
unless
you
bolt
back
to
help
it
in
like
wise
substitute
a
mutton
chop
for
the
pork
and
the
cases
are
exact
parallels
your
parallel
does
not
hold
good
doctor
the
yankee
goes
back
to
his
store
to
earn
money
for
himself
and
not
to
keep
commerce
alive
while
you
go
for
utterly
disinterested
i
see
do
you
said
frank
if
you
think
that
i
fancy
myself
a
better
man
than
the
yankee
you
mistake
me
but
at
least
you
will
confess
that
i
am
not
working
for
money
no
you
have
your
notions
of
reward
and
he
has
his
he
wants
to
be
paid
by
material
dollars
payable
next
month
you
by
spiritual
dollars
payable
when
you
die
i
do
see
the
great
difference
only
the
slight
difference
between
what
is
material
and
what
is
spiritual
they
seem
to
me
from
all
i
can
hear
in
pulpits
to
be
only
two
different
sorts
of
pleasant
things
and
to
be
sought
after
both
alike
simply
because
they
are
pleasant
if
you
will
forgive
me
seems
to
me
the
spring
of
both
only
to
do
you
justice
you
are
a
and
more
prudent
man
than
the
yankee
storekeeper
and
having
more
exquisitely
developed
notions
of
what
your
true
is
are
content
to
wait
a
little
longer
than
he
you
stab
with
a
jest
thurnall
you
little
know
how
your
words
hit
home
well
then
to
turn
from
a
matter
of
which
i
know
nothing
i
must
keep
you
in
and
give
you
parish
business
to
do
at
home
i
am
come
to
consult
you
as
my
spiritual
pastor
and
master
frank
looked
a
little
astonished
do
be
alarmed
i
am
not
going
to
confess
my
own
sins
only
other
people
pray
do
then
i
know
far
more
of
them
already
than
i
can
cure
i
am
worn
out
with
the
daily
discovery
of
fresh
evil
wherever
i
go
then
why
not
comfort
yourself
by
trying
to
find
a
little
fresh
good
wherever
you
go
frank
sighed
perhaps
though
you
do
care
for
any
sort
of
good
except
your
own
sort
of
good
you
are
fastidious
well
you
have
your
excuses
but
you
can
understand
a
poor
fellow
like
me
who
has
been
dragged
through
the
slums
and
sewers
of
this
wicked
world
for
fifteen
years
and
more
being
very
well
content
with
any
sort
of
good
which
i
can
light
on
and
not
particular
as
to
either
quantity
or
quality
perhaps
yours
is
the
healthier
state
of
mind
if
you
can
only
find
the
said
good
the
vulturine
nose
which
smells
nothing
but
corruption
is
no
credit
to
its
possessor
and
it
would
be
pleasant
at
least
to
find
good
in
every
man
one
ca
do
that
in
one
study
mixing
with
them
is
the
only
plan
no
doubt
they
inconsistent
enough
the
more
you
see
of
them
the
less
you
trust
them
and
yet
the
more
you
see
of
them
the
more
you
like
them
can
you
solve
that
paradox
from
your
books
i
will
try
said
frank
i
generally
have
more
than
one
to
think
over
when
you
go
but
surely
there
are
men
so
fallen
that
they
are
utterly
insensible
to
good
very
likely
there
no
saying
in
this
world
what
may
not
be
only
i
never
saw
one
i
tell
you
a
story
you
may
apply
it
as
you
like
when
i
was
on
the
texan
expedition
and
raw
to
soldiering
and
camping
we
had
to
sleep
in
low
ground
and
suffered
terribly
from
a
miasma
deadly
cold
it
was
when
it
came
and
the
man
who
once
got
chilled
through
with
it
just
died
i
was
lying
on
the
bare
ground
one
night
and
chilly
enough
i
was
for
i
was
short
of
clothes
and
had
lost
my
buffalo
robe
but
fell
asleep
and
on
waking
the
next
morning
i
found
myself
covered
up
in
my
comrade
blankets
even
to
his
coat
while
he
was
sitting
shivering
in
his
shirt
sleeves
the
cold
fog
had
come
down
in
the
night
and
the
man
had
stripped
himself
and
sat
all
night
with
death
staring
him
in
the
face
to
save
my
life
and
all
the
reason
he
gave
was
that
if
one
of
us
must
die
it
was
better
the
older
should
go
first
and
not
a
youngster
like
me
and
said
tom
lowering
his
voice
that
man
was
a
murderer
a
murderer
yes
a
drunken
gambling
rowdy
as
ever
grew
ripe
for
the
gallows
now
will
you
tell
me
that
there
was
nothing
in
that
man
but
what
the
devil
put
there
frank
sat
meditating
awhile
on
this
strange
story
which
is
moreover
a
true
one
and
then
looked
up
with
something
like
tears
in
his
eyes
and
he
did
not
die
not
he
i
saw
him
die
afterwards
shot
through
the
heart
without
time
even
to
cry
out
but
i
have
not
forgotten
what
he
did
for
me
that
night
and
i
tell
you
what
sir
i
do
not
believe
that
god
has
forgotten
it
either
frank
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
then
tom
changed
the
subject
i
want
to
know
what
you
can
tell
me
about
this
mr
vavasour
hardly
anything
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
was
at
his
house
at
tea
two
or
three
times
when
i
first
came
and
i
had
very
agreeable
evenings
and
talks
on
art
and
poetry
but
i
believe
i
offended
him
by
hinting
that
he
ought
to
come
to
church
which
he
never
does
and
since
then
our
acquaintance
has
all
but
ceased
i
suppose
you
will
say
as
usual
that
i
played
my
cards
badly
there
also
not
at
all
said
tom
who
was
disposed
to
take
any
one
part
against
elsley
if
a
clergyman
has
not
a
right
to
tell
a
man
that
i
do
see
what
right
he
has
of
any
kind
only
added
he
with
one
of
his
quaint
smiles
the
clergyman
if
he
compels
a
man
to
deal
at
his
store
is
bound
to
furnish
him
with
the
articles
which
he
wants
which
he
needs
or
which
he
likes
for
has
both
these
meanings
with
something
that
he
finds
by
experience
does
him
good
and
so
learns
to
like
it
because
he
knows
that
he
needs
it
as
my
patients
do
my
physic
i
wish
my
patients
would
do
so
by
mine
but
unfortunately
half
of
them
seem
to
me
not
to
know
what
their
disease
is
and
the
other
half
do
not
think
they
are
diseased
at
all
well
said
tom
drily
perhaps
some
of
them
are
more
right
than
you
fancy
every
man
knows
his
own
business
best
if
it
were
so
they
would
go
about
it
somewhat
differently
from
what
most
of
the
poor
creatures
do
do
you
think
so
i
fancy
myself
that
not
one
of
them
does
a
wrong
thing
but
what
he
knows
it
to
be
wrong
just
as
well
as
you
do
and
is
much
more
ashamed
and
frightened
about
it
already
than
you
can
ever
make
him
by
preaching
at
him
do
you
i
do
i
judge
of
others
by
myself
then
would
you
have
a
clergyman
never
warn
his
people
of
their
sins
if
i
were
he
i
much
sooner
take
the
sins
for
granted
and
say
to
them
my
friends
i
know
you
are
all
out
of
the
hundred
of
you
not
such
bad
fellows
at
bottom
and
would
all
like
to
be
good
if
you
only
knew
how
so
i
tell
you
as
far
as
i
know
though
i
do
know
much
about
the
matter
for
the
truth
is
you
must
have
a
hundred
troubles
every
day
which
i
never
felt
in
my
life
and
it
must
be
a
very
hard
thing
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
and
to
get
a
little
pleasure
on
this
side
the
grave
without
making
blackguards
of
yourselves
therefore
i
do
pretend
to
set
myself
up
as
a
better
or
a
wiser
man
than
you
at
all
but
i
do
know
a
thing
or
two
which
i
fancy
may
be
useful
to
you
you
can
but
try
it
so
come
up
if
you
like
any
of
you
and
talk
matters
over
with
me
as
between
gentleman
and
gentleman
i
shall
keep
your
secret
of
course
and
if
you
find
i
ca
cure
your
complaint
why
you
can
but
go
away
and
try
elsewhere
and
so
the
doctor
model
sermon
ends
in
proposing
private
confession
of
course
the
thing
itself
which
will
do
them
good
without
the
red
rag
of
an
official
name
which
sends
them
cackling
off
like
frightened
such
private
confession
as
is
going
on
between
you
and
me
now
here
am
i
confessing
to
you
all
my
unorthodoxy
and
i
my
ignorance
said
frank
for
i
really
believe
you
know
more
about
the
matter
than
i
do
not
at
all
i
may
be
all
wrong
but
the
fault
of
your
cloth
seems
to
me
to
be
that
they
apply
their
medicines
without
deigning
most
of
them
to
take
the
least
diagnosis
of
the
case
how
could
i
cure
a
man
without
first
examining
what
was
the
matter
with
him
so
say
the
old
casuists
of
whom
i
have
read
enough
some
would
say
too
much
but
they
do
not
satisfy
me
they
deal
with
actions
and
motives
and
so
forth
but
they
do
not
go
down
to
the
one
root
of
wrong
which
is
the
same
in
every
man
you
are
getting
beyond
me
but
why
do
you
not
apply
a
little
of
the
worldly
wisdom
which
these
same
casuists
taught
you
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
tried
in
past
years
and
found
that
the
medicine
would
not
act
humph
well
that
would
depend
again
on
the
previous
diagnosis
of
human
nature
being
correct
and
those
old
monks
i
should
say
would
know
about
as
much
of
human
nature
as
so
many
daws
in
a
steeple
still
you
would
say
that
what
was
the
matter
with
old
heale
was
the
matter
also
with
vavasour
i
believe
from
my
heart
that
it
is
humph
then
you
know
the
symptoms
of
his
complaint
i
know
that
he
never
comes
to
church
nothing
more
i
am
really
speaking
in
confidence
you
surely
have
heard
of
disagreements
between
him
and
mrs
vavasour
never
i
assure
you
you
shock
me
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
then
that
i
said
a
word
about
it
but
the
whole
parish
talks
of
it
answered
tom
who
was
surprised
at
this
fresh
proof
of
the
little
confidence
which
aberalva
put
in
their
parson
ah
said
frank
sadly
i
am
the
last
person
in
the
parish
to
hear
any
news
but
this
is
very
distressing
very
to
me
my
honour
to
tell
you
the
truth
as
a
medical
man
is
concerned
in
the
matter
for
she
is
growing
quite
ill
from
unhappiness
and
i
can
not
cure
her
so
i
come
to
you
as
to
do
what
i
the
can
not
frank
sat
pondering
for
a
minute
and
then
you
set
me
on
a
task
for
which
i
am
as
little
fit
as
any
man
by
your
own
showing
what
do
i
know
of
disagreements
between
man
and
wife
and
one
has
a
delicacy
about
offering
her
comfort
she
must
bestow
her
confidence
on
me
before
i
can
use
it
while
he
while
he
as
the
cause
of
the
disease
is
what
you
ought
to
treat
and
not
her
unhappiness
which
is
only
a
symptom
of
it
spoken
like
a
wise
doctor
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
thurnall
i
have
no
influence
over
vavasour
and
see
no
means
of
getting
any
if
he
recognised
my
authority
as
his
parish
priest
then
i
should
see
my
way
let
him
be
as
bad
as
he
might
i
should
have
a
fixed
point
from
which
to
work
but
with
his
notions
i
know
well
one
can
judge
it
too
easily
from
his
poems
he
would
look
on
me
as
a
pedant
assuming
a
spiritual
tyranny
to
which
i
have
no
claim
tom
sat
awhile
nursing
his
knee
and
then
if
you
saw
a
man
fallen
into
the
water
what
do
you
think
would
be
the
shortest
way
to
prove
to
him
that
you
had
authority
from
heaven
to
pull
him
out
do
you
give
it
up
pulling
him
out
would
it
not
be
without
more
ado
i
should
be
happy
enough
to
pull
poor
vavasour
out
if
he
would
let
me
but
till
he
believes
that
i
can
do
it
how
can
i
even
begin
how
can
you
expect
him
to
believe
if
he
has
no
proof
there
are
proofs
enough
in
the
bible
and
elsewhere
if
he
will
but
accept
them
if
he
refuses
to
examine
into
the
credentials
the
fault
is
his
not
mine
i
really
do
not
wish
to
be
hard
but
would
not
you
do
the
same
if
any
one
refused
to
employ
you
because
he
chose
to
deny
that
you
were
a
legally
qualified
practitioner
not
so
badly
put
but
what
should
i
do
in
that
case
go
on
quietly
curing
his
neighbours
till
he
began
to
alter
his
mind
as
to
my
qualifications
and
came
in
to
be
cured
himself
but
here
this
difference
between
you
and
me
i
am
not
bound
to
attend
to
any
one
who
do
send
for
me
while
you
think
that
you
are
and
carry
the
notion
a
little
too
far
for
i
expect
you
to
kill
yourself
by
it
some
day
well
said
frank
with
something
of
that
lazy
oxford
tone
which
is
intended
to
save
the
speaker
the
trouble
of
giving
his
arguments
when
he
has
already
made
up
his
mind
or
thinks
that
he
has
so
done
well
if
i
thought
myself
bound
to
doctor
the
man
as
you
do
i
would
certainly
go
to
him
and
show
him
at
least
that
i
understood
his
complaint
that
would
be
the
first
step
towards
his
letting
me
cure
him
how
else
on
earth
do
you
fancy
that
paul
cured
those
corinthians
about
whom
i
have
been
reading
lately
are
you
too
going
to
quote
scripture
against
me
i
am
glad
to
find
that
your
studies
extend
to
st
paul
to
tell
you
the
truth
your
sermon
last
sunday
puzzled
me
i
could
not
comprehend
on
your
showing
how
paul
got
that
wonderful
influence
over
those
pagans
which
he
evidently
had
and
as
how
to
get
influence
is
a
very
favourite
study
of
mine
i
borrowed
the
book
when
i
went
home
and
read
for
myself
and
the
matter
at
last
seemed
clear
enough
on
paul
own
showing
i
do
doubt
that
but
i
suspect
your
interpretation
of
the
fact
and
mine
would
not
agree
mine
is
simple
enough
he
says
that
what
proved
him
to
be
an
apostle
was
his
power
he
is
continually
appealing
to
his
power
and
what
can
he
mean
by
that
but
that
he
could
do
and
had
done
what
he
professed
to
do
he
promised
to
make
those
poor
heathen
rascals
of
greeks
better
and
wiser
and
happier
men
and
i
suppose
he
made
them
so
and
then
there
was
no
doubt
of
his
commission
or
his
authority
or
anything
else
he
says
himself
he
did
not
require
any
credentials
for
they
were
his
credentials
read
and
known
of
every
one
he
had
made
good
men
of
them
out
of
bad
ones
and
that
was
proof
enough
whose
apostle
he
was
well
said
frank
half
sadly
i
might
say
a
great
deal
of
course
on
the
other
side
of
the
question
but
i
prefer
hearing
what
you
laymen
think
about
it
all
will
you
be
angry
if
i
tell
you
honestly
did
you
ever
find
me
angry
at
anything
you
said
no
i
will
do
you
the
justice
to
say
that
well
what
we
laymen
say
is
this
if
the
parsons
have
the
authority
of
which
they
boast
why
do
they
use
it
if
they
have
commission
to
make
bad
people
good
they
must
have
power
too
for
he
whose
commission
they
claim
is
not
likely
i
should
suppose
to
set
a
man
to
do
what
he
can
not
do
and
we
can
do
it
if
people
would
but
submit
to
us
it
all
comes
round
again
to
the
same
point
so
it
does
how
to
get
them
to
listen
i
tried
to
find
out
how
paul
achieved
that
first
step
and
when
i
looked
he
told
me
plainly
enough
by
becoming
all
things
to
all
men
by
showing
these
people
that
he
understood
them
and
knew
what
was
the
matter
with
them
now
do
you
go
and
do
likewise
by
vavasour
and
then
exercise
your
authority
like
a
practical
man
if
you
have
power
to
bind
and
loose
as
you
told
us
last
sunday
bind
that
fellow
ungovernable
temper
and
loose
him
from
the
real
slavery
which
he
is
in
to
his
miserable
conceit
and
and
then
if
he
does
not
believe
in
your
power
he
is
even
a
greater
fool
than
i
take
him
for
honestly
i
will
try
god
help
me
added
frank
in
a
lower
voice
but
as
for
quarrels
between
man
and
wife
as
i
told
you
no
one
understands
them
less
than
i
then
marry
a
wife
yourself
and
quarrel
a
little
with
her
for
experiment
and
then
you
know
all
about
it
frank
laughed
in
spite
of
himself
thank
you
no
man
is
less
likely
to
try
that
experiment
than
i
hum
i
have
quite
enough
as
a
bachelor
to
distract
me
from
my
work
without
adding
to
them
those
of
a
wife
and
family
and
those
little
home
lessons
in
the
frailty
of
human
nature
in
which
you
advise
me
to
copy
mr
vavasour
and
so
said
tom
having
to
doctor
human
beings
of
whom
are
married
and
being
aware
that
three
parts
of
the
miseries
of
human
life
come
either
from
wanting
to
be
married
or
from
married
cares
and
troubles
you
think
that
you
will
improve
your
chance
of
doctoring
your
flock
rightly
by
avoiding
carefully
the
least
practical
acquaintance
with
the
chief
cause
of
their
disease
philosophical
and
logical
truly
you
seem
to
have
acquired
a
little
knowledge
of
men
and
women
my
good
friend
without
encumbering
yourself
with
a
wife
and
children
would
you
like
to
go
to
the
same
school
to
which
i
went
asked
thurnall
with
a
look
of
such
grave
meaning
that
frank
pure
spirit
shuddered
within
him
and
i
tell
you
this
whenever
i
see
a
woman
nursing
her
baby
or
a
father
with
his
child
upon
his
knees
i
say
to
myself
they
know
more
at
this
minute
of
human
nature
as
of
the
great
law
of
which
makes
the
world
go
round
than
i
am
likely
to
do
for
many
a
day
i
tell
you
what
sir
these
simple
natural
ties
which
are
common
to
us
and
the
dumb
animals
as
i
live
sir
they
are
the
divinest
things
i
see
in
the
world
i
have
but
one
and
that
is
love
to
my
poor
old
father
all
the
religion
i
have
as
yet
but
i
tell
you
it
alone
has
kept
me
from
being
a
ruffian
and
a
blackguard
and
i
tell
you
more
said
tom
warming
of
all
diabolical
dodges
for
preventing
the
parsons
from
seeing
who
they
are
or
what
human
beings
are
or
what
their
work
in
the
world
is
or
anything
else
the
neatest
is
that
celibacy
of
the
clergy
i
should
like
to
have
you
with
me
in
spanish
america
or
in
france
either
and
see
what
you
thought
of
it
then
how
it
ever
came
into
mortal
brains
is
to
me
the
puzzle
i
often
fancied
when
i
watched
those
priests
and
very
good
fellows
too
some
of
them
are
that
there
must
be
a
devil
after
all
abroad
in
the
world
as
you
say
for
no
human
insanity
could
ever
have
hit
upon
so
complete
and
a
device
for
making
parsons
do
the
more
harm
the
more
good
they
try
to
do
there
i
preached
you
a
sermon
and
made
you
angry
not
in
the
least
but
i
must
go
now
and
see
some
sick
well
go
and
prosper
only
recollect
that
the
said
sick
are
men
and
women
and
away
tom
went
thinking
to
himself
well
that
is
a
noble
straightforward
honest
fellow
and
will
do
yet
if
he
only
get
a
wife
he
not
one
of
those
asses
who
have
made
up
their
minds
by
book
that
the
world
is
square
and
wo
believe
it
to
be
round
for
any
ocular
demonstration
he
find
out
what
shape
the
world
is
before
long
and
behave
as
such
and
act
accordingly
little
did
tom
think
as
he
went
home
that
day
in
satisfaction
with
his
sermon
to
frank
of
the
misery
he
had
caused
and
was
going
to
cause
for
many
a
day
to
poor
grace
harvey
it
was
a
rude
shock
to
her
to
find
herself
thus
suspected
though
perhaps
it
was
one
which
she
needed
she
had
never
since
one
first
trouble
ten
years
ago
known
any
real
grief
and
had
therefore
had
all
the
more
time
to
make
a
luxury
of
unreal
ones
she
was
treated
by
the
simple
folk
around
her
as
all
but
inspired
and
being
possessed
of
real
powers
as
miraculous
in
her
own
eyes
as
those
which
were
imputed
to
her
were
in
theirs
for
what
are
real
spiritual
experiences
but
daily
miracles
she
was
just
in
that
temper
of
mind
in
which
she
required
as
ballast
all
her
real
goodness
lest
the
moral
balance
should
topple
headlong
after
the
intellectual
and
the
downward
course
of
vanity
excitement
deception
blasphemous
assumptions
be
entered
on
happy
for
her
that
she
was
in
protestant
and
england
and
in
a
country
parish
where
mesmerism
and
were
unknown
had
she
been
an
american
she
might
have
become
one
of
the
most
lucrative
mediums
had
she
been
born
in
a
romish
country
she
would
have
probably
become
an
even
more
famous
personage
there
is
no
reason
why
she
should
not
have
equalled
or
surpassed
the
ecstasies
of
theresa
or
of
hildegardis
or
any
other
sweet
dreamer
of
sweet
dreams
have
founded
a
new
order
of
charity
have
enriched
the
clergy
of
a
whole
province
and
have
died
in
seven
years
maddened
by
alternate
paroxysms
of
and
revulsions
of
her
own
preachers
and
indeed
so
do
extremes
meet
would
not
have
been
sorry
to
make
use
of
her
in
somewhat
the
same
manner
however
feebly
and
coarsely
but
her
innate
and
modesty
had
preserved
her
from
the
snares
of
such
clumsy
poachers
and
more
than
one
young
preacher
had
fled
desperately
from
a
station
where
instead
of
making
a
tool
of
grace
harvey
he
could
only
madden
his
own
foolish
heart
with
love
for
her
so
grace
had
reigned
upon
her
pretty
little
throne
of
not
unbearable
sorrows
till
a
real
and
bitter
woe
came
one
which
could
not
be
hugged
and
cherished
like
the
rest
one
which
she
tried
to
fling
from
her
angrily
scornfully
and
found
to
her
horror
that
instead
of
her
possessing
it
it
possessed
her
and
coiled
itself
round
her
heart
and
would
not
be
flung
away
she
she
of
all
beings
to
be
suspected
as
a
thief
and
by
the
very
man
whose
life
she
had
saved
she
was
willing
enough
to
confess
herself
and
confessed
herself
night
and
morning
a
miserable
sinner
and
her
heart
a
cage
of
unclean
birds
deceitful
and
desperately
wicked
except
in
that
the
conscious
innocence
flashed
up
in
pride
and
scorn
in
thoughts
even
when
she
was
alone
in
words
of
which
she
would
not
have
believed
herself
capable
with
hot
brow
and
dry
eyes
she
paced
her
little
chamber
sat
down
on
the
bed
staring
into
vacancy
sprang
up
and
paced
again
but
she
went
into
no
trance
she
dare
not
the
grief
was
too
great
she
felt
that
if
she
once
gave
way
enough
to
lose
her
she
should
go
mad
and
the
first
and
perhaps
not
the
least
good
effect
of
that
fiery
trial
was
that
it
compelled
her
to
a
stern
to
which
her
will
weakened
by
mental
luxuriousness
had
been
long
a
stranger
but
a
fiery
trial
it
was
the
first
wild
and
yet
not
unnatural
fancy
that
heaven
had
given
thurnall
to
her
had
deepened
day
by
day
by
the
mere
indulgence
of
it
but
she
never
dreamt
of
him
as
her
husband
only
as
a
friendless
stranger
to
be
helped
and
comforted
and
that
he
was
worthy
of
help
that
some
great
future
was
in
store
for
him
that
he
was
a
chosen
vessel
marked
out
for
glory
she
had
persuaded
herself
utterly
and
the
persuasion
grew
in
her
day
by
day
as
she
heard
more
and
more
of
his
cleverness
honesty
and
kindliness
mysterious
and
to
her
miraculous
learning
therefore
she
did
not
make
haste
she
did
not
even
try
to
see
him
or
to
speak
to
him
a
civil
bow
in
passing
was
all
that
she
took
or
gave
and
she
was
content
with
that
and
waited
till
the
time
came
when
she
was
destined
to
do
for
him
what
she
knew
not
but
it
would
be
done
if
she
were
strong
enough
so
she
set
herself
to
learn
and
read
and
trained
her
mind
and
temper
more
earnestly
than
ever
and
waited
in
patience
for
god
good
time
and
now
behold
a
black
unfathomable
gulf
of
doubt
and
shame
had
opened
between
them
perhaps
for
ever
and
a
tumult
arose
in
her
soul
which
can
not
be
perhaps
ought
not
to
be
analysed
in
words
but
which
made
her
know
too
well
by
her
own
crimson
cheeks
that
it
was
none
other
than
human
love
strong
as
death
and
jealousy
cruel
as
the
grave
at
last
long
and
agonising
prayer
brought
gentler
thoughts
and
mere
physical
exhaustion
a
calmer
mood
how
wicked
she
had
been
how
rebellious
why
not
forgive
him
as
one
greater
than
she
had
forgiven
it
was
ungrateful
of
him
but
was
he
not
human
why
should
she
expect
his
heart
to
be
better
than
hers
besides
he
might
have
excuses
for
his
suspicion
he
might
be
the
best
judge
being
a
man
and
such
a
clever
one
too
yes
it
was
god
cross
and
she
would
bear
it
she
would
try
and
forget
him
no
that
was
impossible
she
must
hear
of
him
if
not
see
him
day
by
day
besides
was
not
her
fate
linked
up
with
his
and
yet
shut
out
from
him
by
that
dark
wall
of
suspicion
it
was
very
bitter
but
she
could
pray
for
him
she
would
pray
for
him
now
yes
it
was
god
cross
and
she
would
bear
it
he
would
right
her
if
he
thought
fit
and
if
not
what
matter
was
she
not
born
to
sorrow
should
she
complain
if
another
drop
and
that
the
bitterest
of
all
was
added
to
the
cup
and
bear
her
cross
she
did
about
with
her
coming
in
and
going
out
for
many
a
weary
day
there
was
no
change
in
her
habits
or
demeanour
she
was
never
listless
for
a
moment
in
her
school
she
was
more
gay
and
amusing
than
ever
when
she
gathered
her
little
ones
around
her
for
a
story
but
still
there
was
the
unseen
burden
grinding
her
heart
slowly
till
she
felt
as
if
every
footstep
was
stained
with
a
drop
of
her
heart
blood
why
not
it
would
be
the
sooner
over
then
at
times
came
that
strange
woman
pleasure
in
martyrdom
the
secret
pride
of
suffering
unjustly
but
even
that
after
a
while
she
cast
away
from
her
as
a
snare
and
tried
to
believe
that
she
deserved
all
her
sorrow
deserved
it
that
is
in
the
real
honest
sense
of
the
word
that
she
had
worked
it
out
and
earned
it
and
brought
it
on
herself
how
she
knew
not
but
longed
and
strove
to
know
no
it
was
no
martyrdom
she
would
not
allow
herself
so
silly
a
cloak
of
pride
and
she
went
daily
to
her
favourite
book
of
martyrs
to
contemplate
there
the
stories
of
those
who
really
innocent
really
suffered
for
welldoing
and
out
of
that
book
she
began
to
draw
a
new
and
a
strange
enjoyment
for
she
soon
found
that
her
intense
imagination
enabled
her
to
those
sad
and
glorious
stories
in
her
own
person
to
tremble
agonise
and
conquer
with
those
heroines
who
had
been
for
years
her
highest
ideals
and
what
higher
ones
could
she
have
and
many
a
night
after
extinguishing
the
light
and
closing
her
eyes
she
would
lie
motionless
for
hours
on
her
little
bed
not
to
sleep
but
to
feel
with
perpetua
the
wild
bull
horns
to
hang
with
maura
on
the
cross
or
lie
with
julitta
on
the
rack
or
see
with
triumphant
smile
by
anne
askew
side
the
fire
flare
up
around
her
at
the
smithfield
stake
or
to
promise
with
dying
dorothea
celestial
roses
to
the
mocking
youth
whose
face
too
often
took
the
form
of
thurnall
till
every
nerve
quivered
responsive
to
her
fancy
in
agonies
of
actual
pain
which
died
away
at
last
into
heavy
slumber
as
body
and
mind
alike
gave
way
before
the
strain
sweet
fool
she
knew
not
how
could
she
know
that
she
might
be
rearing
in
herself
the
seeds
of
idiotcy
and
death
but
who
that
applauds
a
rachel
or
a
ristori
for
being
able
to
make
awhile
their
souls
and
their
countenances
the
homes
of
the
darkest
passions
can
blame
her
for
enacting
in
herself
and
for
herself
alone
incidents
in
which
the
highest
and
holiest
virtue
takes
shape
in
perfect
tragedy
but
soon
another
and
a
yet
darker
cause
of
sorrow
arose
in
her
it
was
clear
from
what
willis
had
told
her
that
she
had
held
the
lost
belt
in
her
hand
the
question
was
how
had
she
lost
it
did
her
mother
know
anything
about
it
that
question
could
not
but
arise
in
her
mind
though
for
very
reverence
she
dared
not
put
it
to
her
mother
and
with
it
arose
the
recollection
of
her
strange
silence
about
the
matter
why
had
she
put
away
the
subject
carelessly
and
yet
peevishly
when
it
was
mentioned
yes
why
did
her
mother
know
anything
was
she
grace
dared
not
pronounce
the
adjective
even
in
thought
dashed
it
away
as
a
temptation
of
the
devil
dashed
away
too
the
thought
which
had
forced
itself
on
her
too
often
already
that
her
mother
was
not
altogether
one
who
possessed
the
single
eye
that
in
spite
of
her
deep
religious
feeling
her
assurance
of
salvation
her
fits
of
bitter
and
despondency
there
was
an
inclination
to
scheming
and
intrigue
ambition
covetousness
that
the
secrets
which
she
gained
as
too
were
too
often
grace
could
but
fear
used
to
her
own
advantage
that
in
her
dealings
her
morality
was
not
above
the
average
of
little
country
shopkeepers
that
she
was
apt
to
have
two
prices
to
keep
her
books
with
unnecessary
carelessness
when
the
person
against
whom
the
account
stood
was
no
scholar
grace
had
more
than
once
remonstrated
in
her
gentle
way
and
had
been
silenced
rather
than
satisfied
by
her
mother
commonplaces
as
to
the
right
of
making
those
who
could
pay
pay
for
those
who
could
not
that
it
was
very
hard
to
get
a
living
and
the
lord
knew
her
temptations
and
that
god
saw
no
sin
in
his
elect
and
christ
merits
were
infinite
and
christians
always
had
been
a
backsliding
generation
and
all
the
other
commonplaces
by
which
such
people
drug
their
consciences
to
a
degree
which
is
utterly
incredible
except
to
those
who
have
seen
it
with
their
own
eyes
and
heard
it
with
their
own
ears
from
childhood
once
too
in
those
very
days
some
little
meanness
on
her
part
brought
the
tears
into
grace
eyes
and
a
gentle
rebuke
to
her
lips
but
her
mother
bore
the
interference
less
patiently
than
usual
and
answered
not
by
cant
but
by
was
she
the
person
to
accuse
a
poor
widowed
mother
struggling
to
leave
her
child
something
to
keep
her
out
of
the
workhouse
a
mother
that
lived
for
her
would
die
for
her
sell
her
soul
for
her
perhaps
and
there
harvey
stopped
short
turned
pale
and
burst
into
such
an
agony
of
tears
that
grace
terrified
threw
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
entreated
forgiveness
all
the
more
intensely
on
account
of
those
thoughts
within
which
she
dared
not
reveal
so
the
storm
passed
over
but
not
grace
sadness
for
she
could
not
but
see
with
her
clear
pure
spiritual
eye
that
her
mother
was
just
in
that
state
in
which
some
fearful
and
shameful
fall
is
possible
perhaps
wholesome
she
would
sell
her
soul
for
me
what
if
she
have
sold
it
and
stopped
short
just
now
because
she
had
not
the
heart
to
tell
me
that
love
for
me
had
been
the
cause
oh
if
she
have
sinned
for
my
sake
wretch
that
i
am
miserable
myself
and
bringing
misery
with
me
why
was
i
ever
born
why
can
not
i
die
and
the
world
be
rid
of
me
no
she
would
not
believe
it
it
was
a
wicked
horrible
temptation
of
the
devil
she
would
rather
believe
that
she
herself
had
been
the
thief
tempted
during
her
unconsciousness
that
she
had
hidden
it
somewhere
that
she
should
recollect
confess
restore
all
some
day
she
would
carry
it
to
him
herself
grovel
at
his
feet
and
entreat
forgiveness
he
will
surely
forgive
when
he
finds
that
i
was
not
myself
when
that
it
was
not
altogether
my
fault
not
as
if
i
had
been
waking
yes
he
will
forgive
and
then
on
that
thought
followed
a
dream
of
what
might
follow
so
wild
that
a
moment
after
she
had
hid
her
blushes
in
her
hands
and
fled
to
books
to
escape
from
thoughts
chapter
xi
the
first
instalment
of
an
old
debt
we
must
now
return
to
elsley
who
had
walked
home
in
a
state
of
mind
truly
pitiable
he
had
been
flattering
his
soul
with
the
hope
that
thurnall
did
not
know
him
that
his
beard
and
the
change
which
years
had
made
formed
a
sufficient
disguise
but
he
could
not
conceal
from
himself
that
the
very
same
alterations
had
not
prevented
his
recognising
thurnall
and
he
had
been
living
for
two
months
past
in
continual
fear
that
that
would
come
which
now
had
come
his
rage
and
terror
knew
no
bounds
fancying
thurnall
a
merely
mean
and
worldling
untouched
by
those
higher
aspirations
which
stood
to
him
in
place
of
a
religion
he
imagined
him
making
every
possible
use
of
his
power
and
longed
to
escape
to
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
from
his
old
tormentor
whom
the
very
sea
would
not
put
out
of
the
way
but
must
needs
cast
ashore
at
his
very
feet
to
plague
him
afresh
what
a
net
he
had
spread
around
his
own
feet
by
one
act
of
foolish
vanity
he
had
taken
his
present
name
merely
as
a
de
when
first
he
came
to
london
as
a
penniless
and
friendless
scribbler
it
would
hide
him
from
the
ridicule
and
as
he
fancied
spite
of
thurnall
whom
he
dreaded
meeting
every
time
he
walked
london
streets
and
who
was
for
years
to
his
melancholic
and
too
intense
fancy
his
his
frankenstein
familiar
beside
he
was
ashamed
of
the
name
of
briggs
it
certainly
is
not
an
euphonious
or
aristocratic
name
and
the
soul
agonies
by
john
briggs
would
not
have
sounded
as
well
as
the
soul
agonies
by
elsley
vavasour
vavasour
was
a
very
pretty
name
and
one
of
those
which
is
supposed
by
novelists
and
young
ladies
to
be
aristocratic
why
so
is
a
puzzle
as
its
plain
meaning
is
a
and
nothing
more
nor
less
so
he
had
played
with
the
name
till
he
became
fond
of
it
and
considered
that
he
had
a
right
to
it
through
seven
long
years
of
weary
struggles
penury
disappointment
as
he
climbed
the
parnassian
mount
writing
for
magazines
and
newspapers
subediting
this
periodical
and
that
till
he
began
to
be
known
as
a
ready
graceful
and
trustworthy
workman
and
was
befriended
by
one
after
another
for
in
london
at
this
moment
any
young
man
of
real
power
will
find
friends
enough
and
too
many
among
his
fellow
and
is
more
likely
to
have
his
head
turned
by
flattery
than
his
heart
crushed
by
envy
of
course
whatsoever
flattery
he
may
receive
he
is
expected
to
return
and
whatsoever
clique
he
may
be
tossed
into
on
his
he
is
expected
to
stand
by
and
fight
for
against
the
universe
but
that
is
but
fair
if
a
young
gentleman
invited
to
enrol
himself
in
the
society
which
meets
every
monday
and
friday
in
hatchgoose
the
publisher
is
willing
to
pledge
himself
thereto
in
the
mystic
cup
of
tea
is
he
not
as
solemnly
bound
thenceforth
to
support
those
literary
catilines
in
their
efforts
for
the
subversion
of
common
sense
good
taste
and
established
things
in
general
as
if
he
had
pledged
them
as
he
would
have
done
in
rome
of
old
in
his
own
bound
he
is
alike
by
honour
and
by
green
tea
and
it
will
be
better
for
him
to
fulfil
his
bond
for
if
association
is
the
cardinal
principle
of
the
age
will
it
not
work
as
well
in
as
in
and
shall
not
the
motto
of
the
poet
who
will
also
do
a
little
reviewing
on
the
sly
be
henceforth
that
which
shines
triumphant
over
all
the
world
on
many
a
valiant
scotchman
shield
caw
me
and
i
caw
thee
but
to
do
john
briggs
justice
he
kept
his
hands
and
his
heart
also
cleaner
than
most
men
do
during
this
stage
of
his
career
after
the
first
excitement
of
novelty
and
of
mixing
with
people
who
could
really
talk
and
think
and
who
freely
spoke
out
whatever
was
in
them
right
or
wrong
in
language
which
at
least
sounded
grand
and
deep
he
began
to
find
in
the
literary
world
about
the
same
satisfaction
for
his
inner
life
which
he
would
have
found
in
the
sporting
world
or
the
commercial
world
or
the
religious
world
or
the
fashionable
world
or
any
other
world
and
to
suspect
strongly
that
wheresoever
a
world
is
the
flesh
and
the
devil
are
not
very
far
off
tired
of
talking
when
he
wanted
to
think
of
asserting
when
he
wanted
to
discover
and
of
hearing
his
neighbours
do
the
same
tired
of
little
meannesses
envyings
intrigues
jobberies
for
the
literary
world
too
has
its
jobs
he
had
been
for
some
time
withdrawing
himself
from
the
hatchgoose
soirées
into
his
own
thoughts
when
his
soul
agonies
appeared
and
he
found
himself
if
not
a
lion
at
least
a
lion
cub
there
is
a
house
or
two
in
town
where
you
may
meet
on
certain
evenings
everybody
where
duchesses
and
unfledged
poets
bishops
and
red
republican
refugees
noblemen
and
briefless
barristers
who
have
taken
to
politics
are
jumbled
together
for
a
couple
of
hours
to
make
what
they
can
out
of
each
other
to
the
exceeding
benefit
of
them
all
for
each
and
every
one
of
them
finds
his
neighbour
a
pleasanter
person
than
he
expected
and
none
need
leave
those
rooms
without
knowing
something
more
than
he
did
when
he
came
in
and
taking
an
interest
in
some
human
being
who
may
need
that
interest
to
one
of
these
houses
no
matter
which
elsley
was
invited
on
the
strength
of
the
soul
agonies
found
himself
for
the
first
time
face
to
face
with
englishwomen
and
fancied
small
blame
to
him
that
he
was
come
to
the
mountains
of
the
peris
and
to
fairy
land
itself
he
had
been
flattered
already
but
never
with
such
grace
such
sympathy
or
such
seeming
understanding
for
there
are
few
women
who
can
not
seem
to
understand
and
delude
a
hapless
genius
into
a
belief
in
their
own
surpassing
brilliance
and
penetration
while
they
are
cunningly
retailing
again
to
him
the
thoughts
which
they
have
caught
up
from
the
man
to
whom
they
spoke
last
perhaps
for
this
is
the
very
triumph
of
their
art
from
the
very
man
to
whom
they
are
speaking
small
blame
to
bashful
clumsy
john
briggs
if
he
did
not
know
his
own
children
and
could
not
recognise
his
own
stammered
and
fragmentary
fancies
when
they
were
to
him
the
next
minute
in
the
prettiest
shape
and
with
the
most
delicate
articulation
from
lips
which
like
those
in
the
fairy
tale
never
opened
without
dropping
pearls
and
diamonds
oh
what
a
contrast
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
whose
sense
of
beauty
and
grace
whether
physical
or
intellectual
was
true
and
deep
to
that
ghastly
ring
of
prophetesses
in
the
hatchgoose
and
emancipated
women
who
prided
themselves
on
having
cast
off
conventionalities
and
on
being
rude
and
awkward
and
dogmatic
and
irreverent
and
sometimes
slightly
improper
women
who
had
missions
to
mend
everything
in
heaven
and
earth
except
themselves
who
had
quarrelled
with
their
husbands
and
had
therefore
felt
a
mission
to
assert
women
rights
and
reform
marriage
in
general
or
who
had
never
been
able
to
get
married
at
all
and
therefore
were
especially
competent
to
promulgate
a
model
method
of
educating
the
children
whom
they
never
had
had
women
who
wrote
poetry
about
lady
blanches
whom
they
never
had
met
and
novels
about
male
and
female
blackguards
whom
one
hopes
they
never
had
met
or
about
whom
if
they
had
decent
women
would
have
held
their
peace
and
every
one
of
whom
had
in
obedience
to
emerson
followed
her
impulses
and
despised
fashion
and
was
accordingly
clothed
and
bedizened
as
was
right
in
the
sight
of
her
own
eyes
and
probably
in
those
of
no
one
else
no
wonder
that
elsley
ere
long
began
drawing
comparisons
and
using
his
wit
upon
ancient
patronesses
of
course
behind
their
backs
likening
them
to
idols
fresh
from
the
car
of
juggernaut
or
from
the
stern
of
a
south
sea
canoe
or
most
of
all
to
that
famous
wooden
image
of
freya
which
once
leapt
lumbering
forth
from
her
creaking
and
rattling
in
every
oaken
joint
to
belabour
the
too
daring
viking
who
was
flirting
with
her
priestess
even
so
whispered
elsley
did
those
brains
and
tongues
creak
and
rattle
lumbering
before
the
blasts
of
pythonic
inspiration
and
so
he
verily
believed
would
the
awkward
arms
and
legs
have
done
likewise
if
one
of
the
pythonesses
had
ever
so
far
degraded
herself
as
to
dance
no
wonder
then
that
those
gifted
dames
had
soon
to
complain
of
elsley
vavasour
as
a
traitor
to
the
cause
of
progress
and
civilisation
a
renegade
who
had
fled
to
the
camp
of
aristocracy
flunkeydom
obscurantism
frivolity
and
dissipation
though
there
was
not
one
of
them
but
would
have
given
an
eye
perhaps
no
great
loss
to
the
aggregate
loveliness
of
the
universe
for
one
of
his
invitations
to
cavendish
street
with
the
chance
of
being
presented
to
the
duchess
of
lyonesse
to
do
elsley
justice
one
reason
why
he
liked
his
new
acquaintances
so
well
was
that
they
liked
him
he
behaved
well
himself
and
therefore
people
behaved
well
to
him
he
was
as
i
have
said
a
very
handsome
fellow
in
his
way
therefore
it
was
easy
to
him
as
it
is
to
all
physically
beautiful
persons
to
acquire
a
graceful
manner
moreover
he
had
steeped
his
whole
soul
in
old
poetry
and
especially
in
spenser
faery
queen
good
for
him
had
he
followed
every
lesson
which
he
might
have
learnt
out
of
that
most
noble
of
english
books
but
one
lesson
at
least
he
learnt
from
it
and
that
was
to
be
chivalrous
tender
and
courteous
to
all
women
however
old
or
ugly
simply
because
they
were
women
the
hatchgoose
pythonesses
did
not
wish
to
be
women
but
very
bad
imitations
of
men
and
therefore
he
considered
himself
absolved
from
all
knightly
duties
toward
them
but
toward
these
peris
of
the
west
and
to
the
dowagers
who
had
been
peris
in
their
time
what
adoration
could
be
too
great
so
he
bowed
down
and
worshipped
and
on
the
whole
he
was
quite
right
in
so
doing
moreover
he
had
the
good
sense
to
discover
that
though
the
young
peris
were
the
prettiest
to
look
at
the
elder
peris
were
the
better
company
and
that
it
is
in
general
from
married
women
that
a
poet
or
any
one
else
will
ever
learn
what
woman
heart
is
like
and
so
well
did
he
carry
out
his
creed
that
before
his
first
summer
was
over
he
had
quite
captivated
the
heart
of
old
lady
knockdown
aunt
to
lucia
just
and
wife
to
lucia
guardian
a
charming
old
irishwoman
who
affected
a
pretty
brogue
perhaps
for
the
same
reason
that
she
wore
a
wig
and
who
had
been
in
her
day
a
beauty
and
a
blue
a
friend
of
the
miss
berrys
and
tommy
moore
and
grattan
and
lord
edward
fitzgerald
and
dan
and
all
other
lions
and
lionesses
which
had
roared
for
the
last
sixty
years
about
the
emerald
isle
there
was
no
one
whom
she
did
not
know
and
nothing
she
could
not
talk
about
married
up
when
a
girl
to
a
man
for
whom
she
did
not
care
and
having
no
children
she
had
indemnified
herself
by
many
flirtations
and
the
writing
of
two
or
three
novels
in
which
she
penned
on
paper
the
superfluous
feeling
which
had
no
vent
in
real
life
she
had
deserted
as
she
grew
old
the
novel
for
unfulfilled
prophecy
and
was
a
distinguished
leader
in
a
distinguished
religious
coterie
but
she
still
prided
herself
upon
having
a
green
head
upon
grey
shoulders
and
not
without
reason
for
underneath
all
the
worldliness
and
intrigue
and
petty
affectation
of
girlishness
which
she
contrived
to
jumble
in
with
her
religiosity
beat
a
young
and
kindly
heart
so
she
was
charmed
with
vavasour
manners
and
commended
them
much
to
lucia
who
a
shrinking
girl
of
seventeen
was
peeping
at
her
first
season
from
under
lady
knockdown
sheltering
wing
me
dear
let
vavasour
be
who
he
will
he
has
not
only
the
intellect
of
a
true
genius
but
what
is
a
great
deal
better
for
practical
purposes
that
is
the
manners
of
one
give
me
the
man
who
will
let
a
woman
of
our
rank
say
what
we
like
to
him
without
supposing
that
he
may
say
what
he
likes
in
return
and
considers
familiarity
as
an
honour
and
not
as
an
excuse
for
taking
liberties
a
most
agreeable
contrast
indeed
to
the
young
men
of
the
present
day
who
come
in
their
shooting
jackets
and
talk
slang
to
their
partners
though
really
the
girls
are
just
as
bad
and
stand
with
their
backs
to
the
fire
and
smell
of
smoke
and
go
to
sleep
after
dinner
and
pay
no
respect
to
old
age
nor
to
youth
either
i
think
me
word
lucia
the
answers
i
heard
young
gentlemen
make
to
young
ladies
this
very
season
they
have
been
called
out
the
next
morning
in
my
time
me
dear
as
for
the
age
of
chivalry
nobody
expects
that
to
be
restored
but
really
one
might
have
been
spared
the
substitute
for
it
which
we
had
when
i
was
young
in
the
grand
air
of
the
old
school
it
was
a
i
daresay
as
they
call
everything
but
really
me
dear
a
pleasant
sham
is
better
to
live
with
than
an
unpleasant
reality
especially
when
it
smells
of
cigars
so
it
befell
that
elsley
vavasour
was
asked
to
lady
knockdown
and
that
there
he
fell
in
love
with
lucia
and
lucia
fell
in
love
with
him
the
next
winter
old
lord
knockdown
who
had
been
decrepit
for
some
years
past
died
and
his
widow
whose
income
was
under
five
hundred
a
year
for
the
estates
were
entailed
and
mortgaged
and
everything
else
which
can
happen
to
an
irish
property
came
to
live
with
her
nephew
lord
scoutbush
in
eaton
square
and
take
such
care
as
she
could
of
lucia
and
valencia
so
after
a
dreary
autumn
and
winter
of
parting
and
silence
elsley
found
himself
the
next
season
invited
to
eaton
square
there
the
mischief
if
mischief
it
was
was
done
and
elsley
and
lucia
started
in
life
upon
two
hundred
a
year
he
had
inherited
some
fifty
of
his
own
she
had
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
which
indeed
was
not
yet
her
own
by
right
but
little
scoutbush
who
was
her
sole
surviving
guardian
behaved
on
the
whole
very
well
for
a
young
gentleman
of
in
a
state
of
fury
and
astonishment
the
old
lord
had
wisely
enough
settled
in
his
will
that
lucia
was
to
enjoy
the
interest
of
her
fortune
from
the
time
that
she
came
out
provided
she
did
not
marry
without
her
guardian
leave
and
scoutbush
to
avoid
esclandre
and
misery
thought
it
as
well
to
waive
the
proviso
and
paid
her
her
dividends
as
usual
but
how
had
she
contrived
to
marry
at
all
without
his
leave
that
is
an
ugly
question
i
will
not
say
that
she
had
told
a
falsehood
or
that
elsley
had
forsworn
himself
when
he
got
the
licence
but
certainly
both
of
them
were
guilty
of
something
very
like
a
white
lie
when
they
declared
that
lucia
had
the
consent
of
her
sole
surviving
guardian
on
the
strength
of
an
expression
of
scoutbush
that
she
might
marry
whom
she
chose
provided
she
did
not
plague
him
in
the
first
triumph
of
success
and
intoxication
of
wedded
bliss
lucia
had
written
him
a
saucy
letter
reminding
him
of
his
permission
and
saying
that
she
had
taken
him
at
his
word
but
her
conscience
smote
her
and
elsley
smote
him
likewise
and
smote
him
all
the
more
because
he
had
been
married
under
a
false
name
a
fact
which
might
have
ugly
consequences
in
law
which
he
did
not
like
to
contemplate
to
do
him
justice
he
had
been
times
during
his
courtship
on
the
point
of
telling
lucia
his
real
name
and
history
happy
for
him
had
he
done
so
whatever
might
have
been
the
consequences
but
he
wanted
moral
courage
the
hideous
sound
of
briggs
had
become
horrible
to
him
and
once
his
foolish
heart
was
frightened
away
from
honesty
just
as
honesty
was
on
the
point
of
conquering
by
old
lady
knockdown
saying
that
she
could
never
have
married
a
man
with
an
ugly
name
or
let
lucia
marry
one
conceive
becoming
natty
bumppo
me
dear
even
for
twenty
thousand
a
year
if
you
could
summon
up
courage
to
do
the
deed
i
could
summon
up
courage
to
continue
my
correspondence
with
ye
elsley
knew
that
that
was
a
lie
that
the
old
lady
would
have
let
her
marry
the
most
triumphant
snob
in
england
if
he
had
half
that
income
but
unfortunately
lucia
capped
her
aunt
nonsense
with
there
is
no
fear
of
my
ever
marrying
any
one
who
has
not
a
graceful
name
and
a
look
at
vavasour
which
said
and
you
have
one
and
therefore
i
for
the
matter
had
then
been
settled
between
them
this
was
too
much
for
his
vanity
and
too
much
also
for
his
fears
of
losing
lucia
by
confessing
the
truth
so
elsley
went
on
ashamed
of
his
real
name
ashamed
of
having
concealed
it
ashamed
of
being
afraid
that
it
would
be
discovered
in
a
triple
complication
of
shame
which
made
him
gradually
as
it
makes
every
man
moody
suspicious
apt
to
take
offence
where
none
is
meant
besides
they
were
very
poor
he
though
neither
extravagant
nor
profligate
was
like
most
literary
men
who
are
accustomed
to
live
from
hand
to
mouth
careless
unmethodical
she
knew
as
much
of
housekeeping
as
the
queen
of
oude
does
and
her
charming
little
dreams
of
shopping
for
herself
were
rudely
enough
broken
ere
the
first
week
was
out
by
the
horrified
looks
of
clara
when
she
returned
from
her
first
morning
marketing
for
the
weekly
consumption
with
nothing
but
a
woodcock
some
truffles
and
a
bunch
of
celery
then
the
landlady
of
the
lodgings
robbed
her
even
under
the
nose
of
the
faithful
clara
who
knew
as
little
about
housekeeping
as
her
mistress
and
clara
faithful
as
she
was
repaid
herself
by
grumbling
and
taking
liberties
for
being
degraded
from
the
luxurious
post
of
lady
maid
to
that
of
servant
of
all
work
with
a
landlady
and
marchioness
to
wrestle
with
all
day
long
then
what
with
imprudence
and
anxiety
lucia
of
course
lost
her
first
child
and
after
that
came
months
of
illness
during
which
elsley
tended
her
it
must
be
said
for
him
as
lovingly
as
a
mother
and
perhaps
they
were
both
really
happier
during
that
time
of
sorrow
than
they
had
been
in
all
the
delirious
bliss
of
the
honeymoon
valencia
meanwhile
defied
old
lady
knockdown
whose
horror
and
wrath
knew
no
bounds
and
walked
off
one
morning
with
her
maid
to
see
her
prodigal
sister
a
visit
which
not
only
brought
comfort
to
the
weary
heart
but
important
practical
benefits
for
going
home
she
seized
upon
scoutbush
and
so
moved
his
heart
with
pathetic
pictures
of
lucia
penury
and
misery
that
his
heart
was
softened
and
though
he
absolutely
refused
to
call
on
vavasour
he
made
him
an
offer
through
lucia
of
penalva
court
for
the
time
being
and
thither
they
went
perhaps
the
best
thing
they
could
have
done
there
of
course
they
were
somewhat
more
comfortable
a
very
cheap
country
a
comfortable
house
rent
free
and
a
lovely
neighbourhood
were
a
pleasant
change
after
dear
london
lodgings
but
it
is
a
question
whether
the
change
made
elsley
a
better
man
in
the
first
place
he
became
a
more
idle
man
the
rich
enervating
climate
began
to
tell
upon
his
mind
as
it
did
upon
lucia
health
he
missed
that
perpetual
spur
of
nervous
excitement
change
of
society
influx
of
objects
which
makes
london
after
all
the
best
place
in
the
world
for
hard
working
and
which
makes
even
a
walk
along
the
streets
an
intellectual
tonic
in
the
soft
and
luxurious
west
country
nature
invited
him
to
look
at
her
and
dream
and
dream
he
did
more
and
more
day
by
day
he
was
tired
too
as
who
would
not
be
of
the
drudgery
of
writing
for
his
daily
bread
and
relieved
from
the
importunities
of
publishers
and
he
sent
up
fewer
and
fewer
contributions
to
the
magazines
he
would
keep
his
energies
for
a
great
work
poetry
was
after
all
his
forte
he
would
not
fritter
himself
away
on
prose
and
periodicals
but
would
win
for
himself
etc
etc
if
he
made
a
mistake
it
was
at
least
a
pardonable
one
but
elsley
became
not
only
a
more
idle
but
a
more
morose
man
he
began
to
feel
the
evils
of
solitude
there
was
no
one
near
with
whom
he
could
hold
rational
converse
save
an
antiquarian
parson
or
two
and
parsons
were
not
to
his
taste
so
never
measuring
his
wits
against
those
of
his
peers
and
despising
the
few
men
whom
he
met
as
inferior
to
himself
he
grew
more
and
more
wrapt
up
in
his
own
thoughts
and
his
own
tastes
his
own
poems
even
to
the
slightest
turn
of
expression
became
more
and
more
important
to
him
he
grew
more
jealous
of
criticism
more
confident
in
his
own
little
theories
about
this
and
that
more
careless
of
the
opinion
of
his
fellowmen
and
as
a
certain
consequence
more
unable
to
bear
the
little
crosses
and
contradictions
of
daily
life
and
as
lucia
having
brought
one
and
another
child
safely
into
the
world
settled
down
into
motherhood
he
became
less
and
less
attentive
to
her
and
more
and
more
attentive
to
that
self
which
was
fast
becoming
the
centre
of
his
universe
true
there
were
excuses
for
him
for
whom
are
there
none
he
was
poor
and
struggling
and
it
is
much
more
difficult
as
becky
sharp
i
think
pathetically
observes
to
be
good
when
one
is
poor
than
when
one
is
rich
it
is
and
all
rich
people
should
consider
the
fact
much
more
easy
if
not
to
go
to
heaven
at
least
to
think
one
is
going
thither
on
three
thousand
a
year
than
on
three
hundred
not
only
is
respectability
more
easy
as
is
proved
by
the
broad
fact
that
it
is
the
poor
people
who
fill
the
gaols
and
not
the
rich
ones
but
virtue
and
religion
of
the
popular
sort
it
is
undeniably
more
easy
to
be
resigned
to
the
will
of
heaven
when
that
will
seems
tending
just
as
we
would
have
it
much
more
easy
to
have
faith
in
the
goodness
of
providence
when
that
goodness
seems
safe
in
one
pocket
in
the
form
of
and
to
believe
that
one
children
are
under
the
protection
of
omnipotence
when
one
can
hire
for
them
in
half
an
hour
the
best
medical
advice
in
london
one
need
only
look
into
one
own
heart
to
understand
the
disciples
astonishment
at
the
news
that
how
hardly
shall
they
that
have
riches
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
who
then
can
be
saved
asked
they
being
poor
men
accustomed
to
see
the
wealthy
pharisees
in
possession
of
the
highest
religious
privileges
and
means
of
grace
who
indeed
if
not
the
rich
if
the
noblemen
and
the
bankers
and
the
dowagers
and
the
young
ladies
who
go
to
church
and
read
good
books
and
have
been
supplied
from
youth
with
the
very
best
religious
articles
which
money
can
procure
and
have
time
for
all
manner
of
good
works
and
give
their
hundreds
to
charities
and
head
reformatory
movements
and
build
churches
and
work
and
can
taste
all
the
preachers
and
round
london
one
after
another
as
you
would
taste
wines
till
they
find
the
spiritual
panacea
which
exactly
suits
their
complaint
if
they
are
not
sure
of
salvation
who
can
be
saved
without
further
comment
the
fact
is
left
for
the
consideration
of
all
readers
only
let
them
not
be
too
hard
upon
elsley
and
lucia
if
finding
themselves
sometimes
literally
at
their
wits
end
they
went
beyond
their
poor
wits
into
the
region
where
foolish
things
are
said
and
done
moreover
elsley
as
well
as
lucia
had
its
excuses
in
physical
poor
fellow
long
years
of
sedentary
work
had
begun
to
tell
upon
him
and
while
tom
thurnall
chest
under
the
influence
of
hard
work
and
oxygen
measured
round
perhaps
six
inches
more
than
it
had
done
sixteen
years
ago
elsley
thanks
to
stooping
and
carbonic
acid
measured
six
inches
less
short
breath
lassitude
loss
of
appetite
heartburn
and
all
that
fair
company
of
miseries
which
cockle
and
his
antibilious
pills
profess
to
cure
are
no
cheering
bosom
friends
but
when
a
man
is
gradually
growing
into
his
stomach
they
will
make
their
appearance
and
small
blame
to
him
whose
temper
suffers
from
their
gentle
hints
that
he
has
a
mortal
body
as
well
as
an
immortal
soul
but
most
fretting
of
all
was
the
discovery
that
lucia
knew
if
not
all
about
his
original
name
still
enough
to
keep
him
in
dread
lest
she
should
learn
more
it
was
now
twelve
months
and
more
that
this
new
terror
had
leapt
up
and
stared
in
his
face
he
had
left
a
letter
about
a
thing
which
he
was
apt
to
do
in
which
the
whitbury
lawyer
made
some
allusions
to
his
little
property
and
he
was
sure
that
lucia
had
seen
it
the
hated
name
of
briggs
certainly
she
had
not
seen
for
elsley
had
torn
it
out
the
moment
he
opened
the
letter
but
she
had
seen
enough
as
he
soon
found
to
be
certain
that
he
had
at
some
time
or
other
passed
under
a
different
name
if
lucia
had
been
a
more
thoughtful
or
woman
she
would
have
gone
straight
to
her
husband
and
quietly
and
lovingly
asked
him
to
tell
her
all
but
in
her
irish
fashion
she
kept
the
secret
to
herself
and
thought
it
a
very
good
joke
to
have
him
in
her
power
and
to
be
able
to
torment
him
about
that
letter
when
he
got
out
of
temper
it
never
occurred
however
to
her
that
his
present
name
was
the
feigned
one
she
fancied
that
he
had
in
some
youthful
escapade
assumed
the
name
to
which
the
lawyer
alluded
so
the
next
time
he
was
cross
she
tried
laughingly
the
effect
of
her
spell
and
was
at
the
storm
which
she
evoked
in
a
voice
of
thunder
elsley
commanded
her
never
to
mention
the
subject
again
and
showed
such
signs
of
terror
and
remorse
that
she
obeyed
him
from
that
day
forth
except
when
now
and
then
she
lost
her
temper
as
completely
too
as
he
little
she
thought
in
her
heedlessness
what
a
dark
cloud
of
fear
and
suspicion
ever
deepening
and
spreading
she
had
put
between
his
heart
and
hers
but
if
elsley
had
dreaded
her
knowledge
of
his
story
he
dreaded
ten
times
more
tom
knowledge
of
it
what
if
thurnall
should
tell
lucia
what
if
lucia
should
make
a
confidant
of
thurnall
women
told
their
doctors
everything
and
lucia
he
knew
too
well
had
cause
to
complain
of
him
perhaps
thought
he
maddened
into
wild
suspicion
by
the
sense
of
his
own
she
might
complain
of
him
she
might
combine
with
thurnall
against
him
for
what
purpose
he
knew
not
but
the
wildest
imaginations
flashed
across
him
as
he
hurried
desperately
home
intending
as
soon
as
he
got
there
to
forbid
lucia
ever
calling
in
his
dreaded
enemy
no
thurnall
should
never
cross
his
door
again
on
that
one
point
he
was
determined
but
on
nothing
else
however
his
intention
was
never
fulfilled
for
long
before
he
reached
home
he
began
to
feel
himself
thoroughly
his
was
a
temperament
upon
which
mental
anxiety
acts
rapidly
and
severely
and
the
burning
sun
and
his
rapid
walk
combined
with
rage
and
terror
to
give
him
such
a
turn
that
as
he
hurried
down
the
lane
he
found
himself
reeling
like
a
drunken
man
he
had
just
time
to
hurry
through
the
garden
and
into
his
study
when
pulse
and
sense
failed
him
and
he
rolled
over
on
the
sofa
in
a
dead
faint
lucia
had
seen
him
come
in
and
heard
him
fall
and
rushed
in
the
poor
little
thing
was
at
her
wits
end
and
thought
that
he
had
had
nothing
less
than
a
and
when
he
recovered
from
his
faintness
he
began
to
be
so
horribly
ill
that
clara
who
had
been
called
in
to
help
had
some
grounds
for
the
degrading
hypothesis
for
which
lucia
all
but
boxed
her
ears
that
master
had
got
away
into
the
woods
and
gone
eating
toadstools
or
some
such
poisonous
stuff
for
he
lay
a
full
on
the
sofa
and
almost
pulseless
moaning
shuddering
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
and
refusing
cordials
medicines
and
above
all
a
doctor
visit
however
this
could
not
be
allowed
to
last
without
knowledge
a
messenger
was
despatched
for
thurnall
and
luckily
met
him
in
the
lane
for
he
was
returning
to
the
town
in
the
footsteps
of
his
victim
elsley
horror
was
complete
when
the
door
opened
and
lucia
brought
in
none
other
than
his
tormentor
my
dearest
elsley
i
have
sent
for
thurnall
i
knew
you
would
not
let
me
if
i
told
you
but
you
see
i
have
done
it
and
now
you
must
really
speak
to
him
elsley
first
impulse
was
to
motion
them
both
away
angrily
but
the
thought
that
he
was
in
thurnall
power
stopped
him
he
must
not
show
his
disgust
what
if
lucia
were
to
ask
its
cause
even
to
guess
it
for
to
his
fears
even
that
seemed
possible
a
fresh
misery
just
because
he
shrank
so
intensely
from
the
man
he
must
endure
him
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
me
said
he
languidly
i
should
be
the
best
judge
of
that
after
what
vavasour
has
just
told
me
said
tom
in
his
most
professional
and
civil
voice
and
slipped
catlike
into
a
seat
beside
the
unresisting
poet
he
asked
question
on
question
but
elsley
gave
such
unsatisfactory
answers
that
lucia
had
to
detail
everything
afresh
for
him
with
you
know
thurnall
he
is
always
overtasking
his
brain
and
will
never
confess
himself
ill
and
all
a
woman
anxious
comments
rogue
tom
knew
all
the
while
well
enough
what
was
the
cause
but
he
saw
too
that
elsley
was
very
ill
he
felt
that
he
must
have
the
matter
out
at
once
and
by
a
side
glance
sent
the
obedient
lucia
out
of
the
room
to
get
a
of
brandy
now
my
dear
sir
that
we
are
alone
began
he
blandly
now
sir
answered
vavasour
springing
off
the
sofa
his
whole
wrath
exploding
in
hissing
steam
the
moment
the
was
lifted
now
sir
what
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
insolence
this
intrusion
i
beg
your
pardon
vavasour
answered
tom
rising
in
a
tone
of
bland
and
stolid
surprise
what
do
you
want
here
with
your
mummery
and
medicine
when
you
know
the
cause
of
my
malady
well
enough
already
go
sir
and
leave
me
to
myself
my
dear
sir
said
tom
firmly
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
what
passed
between
us
this
morning
will
you
insult
me
beyond
endurance
cried
elsley
i
told
you
that
as
long
as
you
chose
you
were
elsley
vavasour
and
i
the
country
doctor
we
have
met
in
that
character
why
not
sustain
it
you
are
really
ill
and
if
i
know
the
cause
i
am
all
the
more
likely
to
know
the
cure
cure
why
not
believe
me
it
is
in
your
power
to
become
a
much
happier
man
simply
by
becoming
a
healthier
one
impertinence
pish
what
can
i
gain
by
being
impertinent
sir
i
know
very
well
that
you
have
received
a
severe
shock
but
i
know
equally
well
that
if
you
were
as
you
ought
to
be
you
would
not
feel
it
in
this
way
when
one
sees
a
man
in
the
state
of
prostration
in
which
you
are
common
sense
tells
one
that
the
body
must
have
been
neglected
for
the
mind
to
gain
such
power
over
it
elsley
replied
with
a
grunt
but
tom
went
on
bland
and
imperturbable
believe
me
it
may
be
a
very
materialist
view
of
things
but
fact
is
fact
the
is
father
to
the
tonics
and
exercise
make
the
ills
of
life
look
marvellously
smaller
you
have
the
frame
of
a
strong
and
active
man
and
all
you
want
to
make
you
and
cheerful
is
to
develop
what
nature
has
given
you
it
is
too
late
said
elsley
pleased
as
most
men
are
by
being
told
that
they
might
be
strong
and
active
not
in
the
least
three
months
would
strengthen
your
muscles
open
your
chest
again
settle
your
digestion
and
make
you
as
fresh
as
a
lark
and
able
to
sing
like
one
believe
me
the
poetry
would
be
the
better
for
it
as
well
as
the
stomach
now
positively
i
shall
begin
questioning
you
so
elsley
was
won
to
detail
the
symptoms
of
internal
which
he
was
only
too
much
in
the
habit
of
watching
himself
but
there
were
some
among
them
which
tom
could
not
quite
account
for
on
the
ground
of
mere
effeminate
habits
a
thought
struck
him
you
sleep
ill
i
suppose
said
he
carelessly
very
did
you
ever
try
opiates
no
yes
that
is
sometimes
ah
said
tom
more
carelessly
still
for
he
wished
to
hide
by
all
means
the
importance
of
the
confession
well
they
give
relief
for
a
time
but
they
are
dangerous
things
disorder
the
digestion
and
have
their
revenge
on
the
nerves
next
morning
as
spitefully
as
brandy
itself
much
better
try
a
glass
of
strong
ale
or
porter
just
before
going
to
bed
i
known
it
give
sleep
even
in
consumption
try
it
and
exercise
you
shoot
no
pity
there
ought
to
be
noble
cocking
in
these
woods
however
the
season
past
you
fish
no
pity
again
i
hear
alva
is
full
of
trout
why
not
try
sailing
nothing
oxygenates
the
lungs
like
a
sail
and
your
friends
the
fishermen
would
be
delighted
to
have
you
as
they
are
always
full
of
your
stories
to
them
and
your
picking
their
brains
for
old
legends
and
adventures
they
are
noble
fellows
and
i
want
no
better
company
but
unfortunately
i
am
always
ah
wholesome
but
unpleasant
you
are
fond
of
gardening
very
but
stooping
makes
my
head
swim
true
and
i
do
want
you
to
stoop
i
hope
to
see
you
soon
as
erect
as
a
guardsman
why
not
try
walks
abominable
bores
lonely
aimless
well
perhaps
you
right
i
never
knew
but
three
men
who
took
long
constitutionals
on
principle
and
two
of
them
were
cracked
but
why
not
try
a
companion
and
persuade
that
curate
who
needs
just
the
same
medicine
as
you
to
accompany
you
i
do
know
a
more
agreeable
man
than
he
is
thank
you
i
can
choose
my
acquaintances
for
myself
you
touchy
ass
said
thurnall
to
himself
if
we
were
in
the
blessed
state
of
nature
now
would
i
give
you
ten
minutes
double
thonging
and
then
set
you
to
work
as
the
runaway
nigger
did
his
master
bird
o
freedom
sawin
till
you
learnt
a
thing
or
two
but
blandly
still
he
went
on
try
the
then
nothing
like
them
for
opening
your
chest
and
do
get
a
high
desk
made
and
stand
to
your
writing
instead
of
sitting
and
tom
actually
made
vavasour
promise
to
do
both
and
bade
him
farewell
with
now
i
send
you
up
a
little
tonic
and
trouble
you
with
no
more
visits
till
you
send
for
me
i
shall
see
by
one
glance
at
your
face
whether
you
are
following
my
prescriptions
and
i
say
i
meddle
with
those
opiates
any
more
try
good
malt
and
hops
instead
those
who
drink
beer
think
beer
said
elsley
smiling
for
he
was
getting
more
hopeful
of
himself
and
his
terrors
were
vanishing
beneath
tom
skilful
management
and
those
who
drink
water
think
water
the
elizabethans
sidney
and
shakspeare
burleigh
and
queen
bess
worked
on
beef
and
ale
and
you
would
not
class
them
among
the
of
the
earth
believe
me
to
write
well
you
must
live
well
if
you
take
it
out
of
your
brain
you
must
put
it
in
again
it
a
question
of
fact
try
it
for
yourself
and
off
tom
went
while
lucia
rushed
back
to
her
husband
covered
him
with
caresses
assured
him
that
he
was
seven
times
as
ill
as
he
really
was
and
so
nursed
and
petted
him
that
he
felt
himself
for
that
time
at
least
a
beast
and
a
fool
for
having
suspected
her
for
a
moment
ah
woman
if
you
only
knew
how
you
carry
our
hearts
in
your
hands
and
would
but
use
your
power
for
our
benefit
what
angels
you
might
make
us
all
so
said
tom
as
he
went
home
he
has
found
his
way
to
the
has
he
as
well
as
heale
it
no
concern
of
mine
but
as
a
professional
man
i
must
stop
that
you
will
certainly
be
no
credit
to
me
if
you
kill
yourself
under
my
hands
tom
went
straight
home
showed
the
blacksmith
how
to
make
a
pair
of
covered
them
himself
with
leather
and
sent
them
up
the
next
morning
with
directions
to
be
used
for
half
an
hour
morning
and
evening
and
something
whether
it
was
the
or
the
tonic
or
wholesome
fear
of
the
terrible
doctor
kept
elsley
for
the
next
month
in
better
spirits
and
temper
than
he
had
been
in
for
a
long
while
moreover
tom
set
lucia
to
coax
him
into
walking
with
headley
she
succeeded
at
last
and
on
the
whole
each
of
them
soon
found
that
he
had
something
to
learn
from
the
other
elsley
improved
daily
in
health
and
lucia
wrote
to
valencia
flaming
accounts
of
the
wonderful
doctor
who
had
been
cast
on
shore
in
their
world
end
and
received
from
her
after
a
while
this
amid
much
more
for
fancy
is
not
exuberant
enough
to
reproduce
the
whole
of
a
young
lady
i
am
so
ashamed
i
ought
to
have
told
you
of
that
doctor
a
fortnight
ago
but
as
i
am
i
forgot
all
about
it
do
you
know
he
is
sabina
mellot
dearest
friend
and
she
begged
me
to
recommend
him
to
you
but
i
put
it
off
and
then
it
slipped
my
memory
like
everything
else
good
she
has
told
me
the
most
wonderful
stories
of
his
courage
and
goodness
and
conceive
she
and
her
husband
were
taken
prisoners
with
him
by
the
savages
in
the
south
seas
and
going
to
be
eaten
she
says
but
he
helped
them
to
escape
in
a
canoe
such
a
story
and
lived
with
them
for
three
months
on
the
most
beautiful
desert
island
it
is
all
like
a
fairy
tale
i
tell
it
you
when
i
come
darling
which
i
shall
do
in
a
fortnight
and
we
shall
be
all
so
happy
i
have
such
a
box
ready
for
you
and
the
chicks
which
i
shall
bring
with
me
and
some
pretty
things
from
scoutbush
beside
who
is
very
low
poor
fellow
i
can
not
conceive
what
about
but
wonderfully
tender
about
you
i
fancy
he
must
be
in
love
for
he
stood
up
the
other
day
about
you
to
my
aunt
quite
solemnly
with
her
alone
my
lady
she
not
the
first
whom
love
has
made
a
fool
of
and
she
wo
be
the
last
and
i
believe
that
some
of
the
moves
which
look
most
foolish
turn
out
best
after
all
live
and
let
live
everybody
knows
his
own
business
best
anything
is
better
than
marriage
without
real
affection
conceive
my
astonishment
at
hearing
the
dear
little
fellow
turn
sage
in
that
way
by
the
way
i
have
had
to
quote
his
own
advice
against
him
for
i
have
refused
lord
chalkclere
after
all
i
told
him
not
that
he
was
much
too
good
for
me
far
too
perfect
and
complete
a
person
that
i
preferred
a
husband
whom
i
could
break
in
for
myself
even
though
he
gave
me
a
little
trouble
scoutbush
was
cross
at
first
but
he
said
afterwards
that
it
was
just
like
baby
blake
the
wretch
always
calls
me
baby
blake
now
after
that
dreadful
girl
in
lever
novel
and
i
told
him
frankly
that
it
was
if
he
meant
that
i
had
sooner
break
in
a
for
myself
even
though
i
had
a
fall
or
two
in
the
process
than
jog
along
on
the
most
finished
little
pony
on
earth
who
would
never
go
out
of
an
amble
lord
chalk
may
be
very
finished
and
learned
and
excellent
and
so
forth
but
i
want
not
a
white
rabbit
of
which
he
always
reminds
me
but
a
hero
even
though
he
be
a
naughty
one
i
always
fancy
people
must
be
very
little
if
they
can
be
finished
off
so
rapidly
if
there
was
any
real
verve
in
them
they
would
take
somewhat
longer
to
grow
lord
chalk
would
do
very
well
to
bind
in
russian
leather
and
put
on
one
library
shelves
to
be
consulted
when
one
forgot
a
date
but
really
even
your
ulysses
of
a
doctor
provided
of
course
he
turned
out
a
prince
in
disguise
and
do
leave
out
his
h
would
be
more
to
the
taste
of
your
naughtiest
of
sisters

cause
then
i
will
and
it
just
a
for
love
of
this
body
here
and
more
the
pity
more
the
pity
indeed
and
it
my
opeenion
the
puir
laddie
will
just
die
if
nobody
sees
to
him
and
i
taken
the
liberty
of
writing
to
major
cawmill
mysel
to
beg
him
to
come
up
and
see
to
him
for
it
a
pity
to
see
his
lordship
cast
away
for
want
of
an
understanding
body
to
advise
him
so
i
am
not
an
understanding
body
bowie
oh
madam
ye
young
and
bonny
says
bowie
in
a
tone
in
which
admiration
is
not
unmingled
with
pity
young
indeed
bowie
do
you
know
that
i
am
almost
as
old
as
you
hoot
hut
hut
says
bowie
looking
at
the
complexion
and
bright
really
i
am
i
past
this
many
a
day
weel
then
madam
if
you
excuse
me
ye
old
enough
to
be
wiser
than
to
let
his
lordship
be
inveigled
with
any
such
really
he
not
inveigled
says
sabina
laughing
it
is
all
his
own
fault
and
i
have
warned
him
how
absurd
and
impossible
it
is
she
has
refused
even
to
see
him
and
you
know
yourself
he
has
not
been
near
our
house
for
these
three
weeks
ah
madam
you
excuse
me
but
that
the
way
with
that
sort
of
people
just
to
draw
back
and
draw
back
to
make
a
poor
young
gentleman
follow
them
all
the
keener
as
a
trout
does
a
minnow
the
faster
you
spin
it
i
assure
you
no
i
ca
let
you
into
ladies
secrets
but
there
is
no
more
chance
of
her
listening
to
him
than
of
me
and
as
for
me
i
have
been
trying
all
the
spring
to
marry
him
to
a
young
lady
with
eighty
thousand
pounds
so
you
ca
complain
of
me
eh
no
that
more
like
and
fitting
well
now
tell
his
lordship
that
we
are
coming
and
trust
us
bowie
we
do
not
look
very
villainous
do
we
faith
then
and
i
suppose
not
said
bowie
using
the
verb
which
in
his
cautious
scottish
tongue
expresses
complete
certainty
the
truth
is
that
bowie
adores
both
sabina
and
her
husband
who
are
he
says
just
fit
to
be
put
under
a
glass
case
on
the
sideboard
like
twa
wee
china
angels
in
half
an
hour
they
were
in
scoutbush
rooms
they
found
the
little
man
lying
on
his
sofa
in
his
looking
pale
and
pitiable
enough
he
had
been
trying
to
read
for
the
table
by
him
was
covered
with
books
but
either
gunnery
and
mathematics
had
injured
his
eyes
or
he
had
been
crying
sabina
inclined
to
the
latter
opinion
this
is
very
kind
of
you
both
but
i
do
want
you
claude
i
want
mellot
you
go
to
the
window
with
bowie
bowie
and
claude
shrugged
their
shoulders
at
each
other
and
departed
now
mellot
i
ca
help
looking
up
to
you
as
a
mother
complimentary
to
my
youth
says
sabina
who
always
calls
herself
young
when
she
is
called
old
and
old
when
she
is
called
young
i
did
mean
to
be
rude
but
one
does
long
to
open
one
heart
i
never
had
any
mother
to
talk
to
you
know
and
i
ca
tell
my
aunt
and
valencia
is
so
flighty
and
i
thought
you
would
give
me
one
chance
more
do
laugh
at
me
i
say
i
am
really
past
laughing
at
i
see
you
are
you
poor
creature
says
sabina
melting
and
a
long
conversation
follows
while
claude
and
bowie
exchange
confidences
and
arrive
at
no
result
beyond
the
undeniable
assertion
it
is
a
very
bad
job
presently
sabina
comes
out
and
scoutbush
calls
cheerfully
from
the
sofa
bowie
get
my
bath
and
things
to
dress
and
order
me
the
cab
in
half
an
hour
you
dear
people
i
shall
never
thank
you
enough
away
go
claude
and
sabina
in
a
what
have
you
done
given
him
what
he
entreated
for
another
chance
with
marie
it
will
only
madden
him
all
the
more
why
let
him
try
when
you
know
it
is
hopeless
why
i
had
not
the
heart
to
refuse
that
the
truth
and
besides
i
do
know
that
it
is
hopeless
all
the
naughtier
of
you
to
let
him
run
the
chance
of
making
a
fool
of
himself
i
do
know
that
he
will
make
such
a
great
fool
of
himself
as
he
says
his
grandfather
married
an
actress
and
why
should
not
he
simply
because
she
wo
marry
him
and
how
do
you
know
that
sir
you
fancy
that
you
understand
all
the
women
hearts
in
england
just
because
you
have
found
out
the
secret
of
managing
one
little
fool
managing
her
quotha
being
managed
by
her
till
my
quiet
house
is
turned
into
a
perfect
volcano
of
why
i
thought
he
was
to
marry
manchestrina
he
shall
marry
who
he
likes
and
if
marie
changes
her
mind
and
revenges
herself
on
this
american
by
taking
lord
scoutbush
all
i
can
say
is
it
will
be
a
just
judgment
on
him
i
have
no
patience
with
the
heartless
fellow
going
off
thus
and
never
even
leaving
his
address
and
because
you
have
no
patience
you
think
marie
will
have
none
what
do
you
know
about
women
hearts
leave
us
to
mind
our
own
matters
bowie
will
kill
you
outright
if
your
plot
succeeds
no
he
wo
i
know
who
bowie
wants
to
marry
and
if
he
is
not
good
he
sha
have
her
besides
it
will
be
such
fun
to
spite
old
lady
knockdown
who
always
turns
up
her
nose
at
me
how
mad
she
will
be
here
we
are
at
home
now
i
shall
go
and
prepare
marie
an
hour
after
scoutbush
was
pleading
his
cause
with
marie
and
had
been
met
of
course
at
starting
with
the
simple
rejoinder
but
my
lord
you
would
not
surely
have
me
marry
where
i
do
not
love
oh
of
course
not
but
you
see
people
very
often
get
love
after
they
are
married
and
i
am
sure
i
would
do
all
to
make
you
love
me
i
know
i
ca
bribe
you
by
promising
you
carriages
and
jewels
and
all
that
but
you
should
have
what
you
would
like
pictures
and
statues
and
books
and
all
that
i
can
buy
oh
madam
i
know
i
am
not
worthy
of
you
i
never
have
had
any
education
as
you
have
marie
smiled
a
sad
smile
but
i
would
learn
i
know
i
could
for
i
am
no
fool
though
i
say
it
i
like
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
and
if
i
had
you
to
teach
me
i
should
care
about
nothing
else
i
have
given
up
all
my
nonsense
since
i
knew
you
indeed
i
have
i
am
trying
all
day
long
to
read
ever
since
you
said
something
about
being
useful
and
noble
and
doing
one
work
i
have
never
forgotten
that
madam
and
never
shall
and
you
would
find
me
a
pleasant
person
to
live
with
i
do
believe
at
all
events
i
would
oh
madam
i
would
be
your
servant
your
dog
i
would
fetch
and
carry
for
you
like
a
negro
slave
marie
turned
pale
and
rose
listen
to
me
my
lord
this
must
end
you
do
not
know
to
whom
you
are
speaking
you
talk
of
negro
slaves
know
that
you
are
talking
to
one
scoutbush
looked
at
her
in
blank
astonishment
madam
excuse
me
but
my
own
eyes
you
are
not
to
trust
them
i
tell
you
fact
scoutbush
was
silent
she
misunderstood
his
silence
but
went
on
steadily
i
tell
you
my
lord
what
i
expect
you
to
keep
secret
and
i
know
that
i
can
trust
your
honour
scoutbush
bowed
and
what
i
should
never
have
told
you
were
it
not
my
only
chance
of
curing
you
of
this
foolish
passion
i
am
an
american
slave
curse
them
who
dared
make
you
a
slave
cried
scoutbush
turning
as
red
as
a
i
was
born
a
slave
my
father
was
a
white
gentleman
of
good
family
my
mother
was
a
quadroon
and
therefore
i
am
a
slave
a
negress
a
runaway
slave
my
lord
who
if
i
returned
to
america
should
be
seized
and
chained
and
scourged
and
do
you
understand
me
what
an
infernal
shame
cried
scoutbush
to
whom
the
whole
thing
appeared
simply
as
a
wrong
done
to
marie
well
my
lord
well
madam
does
not
this
fact
put
the
question
at
rest
for
ever
no
madam
what
do
i
know
about
slaves
no
one
is
a
slave
in
england
no
madam
all
that
it
does
is
to
make
me
long
to
cut
fellows
throats
and
scoutbush
stamped
with
rage
no
madam
you
are
you
and
if
you
become
my
viscountess
you
take
my
rank
i
trust
and
my
name
is
yours
and
my
family
yours
and
let
me
see
who
dare
interfere
but
public
opinion
my
lord
said
marie
to
find
the
shaft
which
she
had
fancied
fatal
fall
harmless
at
her
feet
public
opinion
you
do
know
england
madam
what
the
use
of
my
being
a
peer
if
i
ca
do
what
i
like
and
make
public
opinion
go
my
way
and
not
i
its
though
i
am
no
great
prince
madam
but
only
a
poor
irish
viscount
it
hard
if
i
ca
marry
whom
i
like
in
reason
that
is
and
expect
all
the
world
to
call
on
her
and
treat
her
as
she
deserves
why
madam
you
will
have
all
london
at
your
feet
after
a
season
or
two
and
all
the
more
if
they
know
your
story
or
if
you
do
like
that
or
if
fools
did
talk
at
first
why
we
go
and
live
quietly
at
kilanbaggan
or
at
penalva
and
you
have
all
the
tenants
looking
up
to
you
as
a
goddess
as
i
do
oh
madam
i
would
go
anywhere
live
anywhere
only
to
be
with
you
marie
was
deeply
affected
making
all
allowances
for
the
wilfulness
of
youth
she
could
not
but
see
that
her
origin
formed
no
bar
whatever
to
her
marrying
a
nobleman
and
that
he
honestly
believed
that
it
would
form
none
in
the
opinion
of
his
compeers
if
she
proved
herself
worthy
of
his
choice
and
full
of
new
emotions
she
burst
into
tears
there
now
you
are
melting
i
knew
you
would
madam
signora
and
scoutbush
advanced
to
take
her
hand
never
less
cried
she
drawing
back
do
not
you
only
make
me
miserable
i
tell
you
it
is
impossible
i
can
not
tell
you
you
must
not
do
yourself
and
yours
such
an
injustice
go
i
tell
you
scoutbush
still
tried
to
take
her
hand
go
i
entreat
you
cried
she
at
her
wits
end
or
i
will
really
ring
the
bell
for
mrs
mellot
you
need
not
do
that
madam
said
he
drawing
himself
up
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
being
troublesome
to
ladies
or
being
turned
out
of
i
see
how
it
is
and
his
tone
softened
you
despise
me
and
think
me
a
vain
frivolous
well
i
do
something
yet
that
you
shall
not
despise
and
he
turned
to
go
i
do
not
despise
you
i
think
you
a
generous
gentleman
nobleman
in
all
senses
scoutbush
turned
again
but
again
impossible
i
shall
always
respect
you
but
we
must
never
meet
again
she
held
out
her
hand
little
freddy
caught
and
kissed
it
till
he
was
breathless
and
then
rushed
out
and
blundered
over
sabina
in
the
next
room
no
hope
none
and
though
he
tried
to
squeeze
his
eyes
together
very
tight
the
great
tears
would
come
dropping
down
sabina
took
him
to
a
sofa
and
sat
him
down
while
he
made
his
little
moan
i
told
you
that
she
was
in
love
with
the
american
then
why
do
he
come
back
and
marry
her
hang
him
i
go
after
him
and
make
him
cried
scoutbush
glad
of
any
object
on
which
to
vent
his
wrath
you
ca
for
nobody
knows
where
he
is
now
do
be
good
and
patient
you
will
forget
all
this
i
sha
you
will
not
at
first
but
gradually
and
marry
some
one
really
more
fit
for
you
ah
but
if
i
marry
her
i
sha
love
her
and
then
you
know
mellot
i
shall
go
to
the
bad
again
just
as
much
as
ever
oh
i
was
trying
to
be
steady
for
her
sake
you
can
be
that
still
yes
but
it
so
hard
with
nothing
to
hope
for
i
not
fit
to
take
care
of
myself
i
fit
for
nothing
i
believe
but
to
go
out
and
be
shot
by
those
russians
and
i
do
it
you
must
not
you
are
not
strong
enough
the
doctors
would
not
let
you
go
as
you
are
then
i
get
strong
i
you
go
home
and
be
good
ai
i
good
now
yes
you
are
a
good
sensible
fellow
and
have
behaved
nobly
and
i
honour
you
for
it
and
claude
shall
come
and
see
you
every
day
that
evening
a
note
came
from
scoutbush
dear
mellot
whom
should
i
find
when
i
went
home
but
campbell
i
told
him
all
and
he
says
that
you
and
everybody
have
done
quite
right
so
i
suppose
you
have
and
that
i
am
quite
right
in
trying
to
get
out
to
the
east
so
i
shall
do
it
but
the
doctor
says
i
must
rest
for
six
weeks
at
least
so
campbell
has
persuaded
me
to
take
the
yacht
which
is
at
southampton
and
go
down
to
aberalva
and
then
round
to
snowdon
where
i
have
a
little
and
get
some
fishing
campbell
is
coming
with
me
and
i
wish
claude
would
come
too
he
knows
that
of
mine
vavasour
i
think
and
i
shall
go
and
make
friends
with
him
i
got
very
merciful
to
foolish
lovers
lately
and
claude
can
help
me
to
face
him
for
i
am
a
little
afraid
of
genuises
you
know
so
there
we
pick
up
my
sister
she
goes
down
by
land
this
week
and
then
go
on
to
snowdon
and
claude
can
visit
his
old
quarters
at
the
royal
oak
at
bettws
where
he
and
i
had
that
jolly
week
among
the
painters
do
let
him
come
and
beg
la
signora
not
to
be
angry
with
me
that
all
i
ever
ask
of
her
again
poor
fellow
but
i
ca
part
with
you
claude
let
him
said
la
cordifiamma
he
will
comfort
his
lordship
and
do
you
come
with
me
come
with
you
where
i
will
tell
you
when
claude
is
gone
claude
go
and
smoke
in
the
garden
now
come
with
me
to
germany
sabina
to
germany
why
on
earth
to
germany
i
i
only
said
germany
because
it
came
first
into
my
mind
anywhere
for
rest
anywhere
to
be
out
of
that
poor
man
way
he
will
not
trouble
you
any
more
and
you
will
not
surely
throw
up
your
engagement
of
course
not
said
she
half
peevishly
it
will
be
over
in
a
fortnight
and
then
i
must
have
rest
do
you
see
how
i
want
rest
sabina
had
seen
it
for
some
time
past
that
white
cheek
had
been
fading
more
and
more
to
a
paleness
those
black
eyes
glittered
with
fierce
unhealthy
light
and
dark
rings
round
them
told
not
merely
of
late
hours
and
excitement
but
of
wild
passion
and
midnight
tears
sabina
had
seen
all
and
could
not
but
give
way
as
marie
went
on
i
must
have
rest
i
tell
you
i
am
beginning
i
can
confess
all
to
you
to
want
stimulants
i
am
beginning
to
long
for
brandy
and
water
pah
to
nerve
me
up
to
the
excitement
of
acting
and
then
for
morphine
to
make
me
sleep
after
it
the
very
eau
de
cologne
flask
tempts
me
they
say
that
the
fine
ladies
use
it
before
a
ball
for
other
purposes
than
scent
you
would
not
like
to
see
me
commence
that
practice
would
you
there
is
no
fear
dear
there
is
fear
you
do
not
know
the
craving
for
exhilaration
the
capability
of
in
our
wild
tropic
blood
oh
sabina
i
feel
at
times
that
i
could
sink
so
low
that
i
could
be
so
wicked
so
utterly
wicked
if
i
once
began
take
me
away
dearest
creature
take
me
away
and
let
me
have
fresh
air
and
fair
quiet
scenes
and
rest
rest
oh
save
me
sabina
and
she
put
her
hands
over
her
face
and
burst
into
tears
we
will
go
then
to
the
rhine
shall
it
be
i
have
not
been
there
now
for
these
three
years
and
it
will
be
such
fun
running
about
the
world
by
myself
once
more
and
knowing
all
the
while
that
and
sabina
stopped
she
did
not
like
to
remind
marie
of
the
painful
contrast
between
them
to
the
rhine
yes
and
i
shall
see
the
beautiful
old
world
the
old
vineyards
and
castles
and
hills
which
he
used
to
tell
me
of
taught
me
to
read
of
in
those
sweet
sweet
books
of
longfellow
so
gentle
and
pure
and
calm
so
unlike
me
yes
we
will
see
them
and
perhaps
marie
looked
up
at
her
guessing
her
thoughts
and
blushed
scarlet
you
too
think
then
that
that
she
could
not
finish
her
sentence
sabina
stooped
over
her
and
the
two
beautiful
mouths
met
there
darling
we
need
say
nothing
we
are
both
women
and
can
talk
without
words
then
you
think
there
is
hope
hope
do
you
fancy
that
he
is
gone
so
very
far
or
that
if
he
were
i
could
not
hunt
him
out
have
i
wandered
half
round
the
world
alone
for
nothing
no
but
hope
hope
that
not
hope
but
certainty
if
some
one
i
know
had
but
courage
courage
to
do
what
to
trust
him
utterly
marie
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
shuddered
in
every
limb
you
know
my
story
did
i
gain
or
lose
by
telling
my
claude
all
i
will
she
cried
looking
up
pale
but
firm
i
will
and
she
looked
steadfastly
into
the
mirror
over
the
as
if
trying
to
court
the
reappearance
of
that
ugly
vision
which
haunted
it
and
so
to
nerve
herself
to
the
utmost
and
face
the
whole
truth
in
little
more
than
a
fortnight
sabina
and
marie
with
maid
and
courier
for
marie
was
rich
now
were
away
in
the
old
antwerpen
and
claude
was
rolling
down
to
southampton
by
rail
with
campbell
scoutbush
and
last
but
not
least
the
faithful
bowie
who
had
under
his
charge
what
he
described
to
the
puzzled
as
goads
and
cleiks
and
pirns
and
creels
and
beuks
and
heuks
enough
for
the
cods
o
neufundland
chapter
xiii
incompris
elsley
went
on
between
improved
health
and
the
fear
of
tom
thurnall
a
good
deal
better
for
the
next
month
he
began
to
look
forward
to
valencia
visit
with
equanimity
and
at
last
with
interest
and
was
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
when
in
the
last
week
of
july
a
fly
drove
up
to
the
gate
of
old
penalva
court
and
he
handed
out
therefrom
valencia
and
valencia
maid
lucia
had
discovered
that
the
wind
was
east
and
that
she
was
afraid
to
go
to
the
gate
for
fear
of
catching
cold
her
real
purpose
being
that
valencia
should
meet
elsley
first
she
is
so
impulsive
thought
the
good
little
creature
always
plotting
about
her
husband
that
she
will
rush
upon
me
and
never
see
him
for
the
first
five
minutes
and
elsley
is
so
sensitive
how
can
he
be
otherwise
in
his
position
poor
dear
so
she
refrained
herself
like
joseph
and
stood
at
the
door
till
valencia
was
down
the
having
taken
elsley
somewhat
arm
and
then
she
could
refrain
herself
no
longer
and
the
two
women
ran
upon
each
other
and
kissed
and
sobbed
and
talked
till
lucia
was
out
of
breath
but
valencia
was
not
so
easily
silenced
my
darling
and
you
are
looking
so
much
better
than
i
expected
but
not
quite
yourself
yet
that
naughty
baby
is
killing
you
i
am
sure
and
vavasour
too
i
shall
begin
to
call
him
elsley
if
i
like
him
as
much
as
i
do
now
but
he
is
looking
quite
thin
wearing
himself
out
with
writing
so
many
beautiful
books
that
wreck
was
perfect
and
where
are
the
children
i
must
rush
upstairs
and
devour
them
and
what
a
delicious
old
garden
and
clipt
yews
too
so
dark
and
romantic
and
such
dear
flowers
mr
vavasour
must
show
me
all
over
it
and
over
that
hanging
wood
too
what
a
duck
of
a
place
and
oh
my
dear
i
am
quite
out
of
breath
and
so
she
swept
in
with
her
arm
round
lucia
waist
while
elsley
stood
looking
after
her
well
enough
satisfied
with
her
reception
of
him
and
only
hoping
that
the
stream
of
words
would
slaken
after
a
while
what
a
magnificent
creature
said
he
to
himself
who
could
believe
that
the
three
years
would
make
such
a
change
and
he
was
right
the
tall
lithe
girl
had
bloomed
into
full
glory
and
valencia
just
though
not
delicately
beautiful
was
as
splendid
an
irish
damsel
as
man
need
look
upon
with
a
grand
masque
aquiline
features
luxuriant
black
hair
and
though
it
was
the
of
the
london
season
the
unrivalled
irish
complexion
as
of
the
fair
dame
of
kilkenny
whose
lips
were
like
roses
her
cheeks
were
the
same
like
a
dish
of
fresh
strawberries
smother
in
crame
her
figure
was
perhaps
too
tall
and
somewhat
too
stout
also
but
its
size
was
relieved
by
the
delicacy
of
those
hands
and
feet
of
which
miss
valencia
was
most
pardonably
proud
and
by
that
indescribable
lissomeness
and
lazy
grace
which
irishwomen
inherit
perhaps
with
their
tinge
of
southern
blood
and
when
in
half
an
hour
she
reappeared
with
broad
and
gown
tucked
up
la
over
the
striped
welsh
petticoat
perhaps
to
show
off
the
ankles
which
only
looked
the
finer
for
a
pair
of
heavy
laced
boots
elsley
honestly
felt
it
a
pleasure
to
look
at
her
and
a
still
greater
pleasure
to
talk
to
her
and
to
be
talked
to
by
her
while
she
bent
on
making
herself
agreeable
partly
from
real
good
taste
partly
from
natural
and
partly
too
because
she
saw
in
his
eyes
that
he
admired
her
chatted
sentiment
about
all
heaven
and
earth
for
to
miss
valencia
it
is
sad
to
have
to
say
it
admiration
had
been
now
for
three
years
her
daily
bread
she
had
lived
in
the
thickest
whirl
of
the
world
and
as
most
do
for
a
while
found
it
a
very
pleasant
place
she
had
flirted
with
how
many
must
not
be
told
and
perhaps
with
more
than
one
with
whom
she
had
no
business
to
flirt
little
scoutbush
had
remonstrated
with
her
on
some
such
affair
but
she
had
silenced
him
with
an
irish
jest
you
a
fisherman
freddy
and
when
you
catch
salmon
you
catch
trout
and
when
you
ca
catch
trout
whip
on
the
shallow
for
poor
little
gubbahawns
and
say
that
it
is
all
to
keep
your
hand
in
and
so
do
i
the
old
ladies
said
that
this
was
the
reason
why
she
had
not
married
the
men
however
asserted
that
no
one
dare
marry
her
and
one
had
given
it
as
his
opinion
that
no
man
in
his
rational
senses
was
to
be
allowed
to
have
anything
to
do
with
her
till
she
had
been
well
jilted
two
or
three
times
to
take
the
spirit
out
of
her
but
that
catastrophe
had
not
yet
occurred
and
miss
valencia
still
reigned
triumphant
and
alone
though
her
aunt
old
lady
knockdown
moved
all
the
earth
and
some
dirty
places
too
below
the
earth
to
get
the
wild
irish
girl
off
her
hands
for
quoth
she
i
feel
with
valencia
indeed
just
like
one
of
those
men
who
carry
about
little
dogs
in
the
quadrant
i
always
pity
the
poor
men
so
and
think
how
happy
they
must
be
when
they
have
sold
one
it
is
one
chance
less
you
know
of
having
it
bite
them
horribly
and
then
run
away
after
all
there
was
however
no
more
real
harm
in
valencia
than
there
is
in
every
child
of
adam
town
frivolity
had
not
corrupted
her
she
was
giddy
given
up
to
enjoyment
of
the
present
but
there
was
not
a
touch
of
meanness
about
her
and
if
she
was
selfish
as
every
one
must
needs
be
whose
thoughts
are
of
pleasure
admiration
and
success
she
was
so
unintentionally
and
she
would
have
been
shocked
and
pained
at
being
told
that
she
was
anything
but
the
most
and
generous
creature
on
earth
major
campbell
who
was
her
mentor
as
well
as
her
brother
had
certainly
told
her
so
more
than
once
at
which
she
had
pouted
a
good
deal
and
cried
a
little
and
promised
to
amend
then
packed
up
a
heap
of
things
to
send
to
lucia
half
of
it
much
too
fine
to
be
of
any
use
to
the
quiet
little
woman
and
lastly
gone
out
and
bought
fresh
finery
for
herself
and
forgot
all
her
good
resolutions
whereby
it
befell
that
she
was
tolerably
deep
in
debt
at
the
end
of
every
season
and
had
to
torment
and
kiss
scoutbush
into
paying
her
bills
which
he
did
like
a
good
brother
and
often
before
he
had
paid
his
own
but
howsoever
full
valencia
head
may
have
been
of
fine
garments
and
london
flirtations
she
had
too
much
tact
and
good
feeling
to
talk
that
evening
of
a
world
of
which
even
elsley
knew
more
than
her
sister
for
poor
lucia
had
been
but
eighteen
at
the
time
of
her
escapade
and
had
not
been
presented
twelve
months
so
that
she
was
as
inexperienced
as
any
one
can
be
who
has
only
a
husband
three
children
and
a
household
to
manage
on
less
than
three
hundred
a
year
therefore
valencia
talked
only
of
things
which
would
interest
elsley
asked
him
to
read
his
last
new
poem
which
i
need
not
say
he
did
told
him
how
she
devoured
everything
he
wrote
planned
walks
with
him
in
the
country
seemed
to
consult
his
pleasure
in
every
way
morning
i
shall
sit
with
you
and
the
children
lucia
of
course
i
must
not
interrupt
vavasour
but
really
in
the
afternoon
i
must
ask
him
to
spare
a
couple
of
hours
from
the
muses
vavasour
was
delighted
to
do
anything
where
would
she
walk
where
of
course
to
see
the
beautiful
schoolmistress
who
saved
the
man
from
drowning
and
then
to
see
the
chasm
across
which
he
was
swept
i
shall
understand
your
poem
so
much
better
you
know
if
i
can
but
realise
the
people
and
the
place
and
you
must
take
me
to
see
captain
willis
too
and
even
the
lieutenant
if
he
does
not
smell
too
much
of
brandy
i
will
be
so
gracious
and
civil
quite
the
lady
of
the
castle
you
will
make
quite
a
royal
progress
said
lucia
looking
at
her
with
sisterly
admiration
yes
i
intend
to
usurp
as
many
of
scoutbush
honours
as
i
can
till
he
comes
i
must
lay
down
the
sceptre
in
a
fortnight
you
know
so
i
shall
make
as
much
use
of
it
as
i
can
meanwhile
and
so
on
and
so
on
meaning
all
the
while
to
put
elsley
quite
at
his
ease
and
let
him
understand
that
bygones
were
bygones
and
that
with
her
any
reconciliation
at
all
was
meant
to
be
a
complete
one
which
was
wise
and
right
enough
but
valencia
had
not
counted
on
the
excitable
and
vain
nature
with
which
she
was
dealing
and
lucia
who
had
her
own
fears
from
the
first
evening
was
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
tell
her
of
it
first
from
pride
in
herself
and
then
from
pride
in
her
husband
for
even
if
a
woman
has
made
a
foolish
match
it
is
hard
to
expect
her
to
confess
as
much
and
after
all
a
husband
is
a
husband
and
let
his
faults
be
what
they
might
he
was
still
her
elsley
her
idol
once
and
perhaps
so
she
hoped
her
idol
again
hereafter
and
if
not
still
he
was
her
husband
and
that
was
enough
by
which
you
mean
sir
that
she
considers
herself
bound
to
endure
everything
and
anything
from
him
simply
because
she
had
been
married
to
him
in
church
yes
and
a
great
deal
more
not
merely
being
married
in
church
but
what
being
married
in
church
means
and
what
every
woman
who
is
a
woman
understands
and
lives
up
to
without
flinching
though
she
die
a
martyr
for
it
or
a
confessor
a
far
higher
saint
if
the
truth
was
known
as
it
will
be
some
day
than
all
the
holy
virgins
who
ever
fasted
and
prayed
in
a
convent
since
the
days
when
macarius
first
turned
fakeer
for
to
a
true
woman
the
mere
fact
of
a
man
being
her
husband
put
it
on
the
lowest
ground
that
you
choose
is
utterly
sacred
divine
in
the
might
of
which
she
can
conquer
self
in
a
way
which
is
an
everyday
miracle
and
the
man
who
does
not
feel
about
the
mere
fact
of
a
woman
having
given
herself
utterly
to
him
just
what
she
herself
feels
about
it
ought
to
be
despised
by
all
his
fellows
were
it
not
that
in
that
case
it
would
be
necessary
to
despise
more
human
beings
than
is
safe
for
the
soul
of
any
man
that
fortnight
was
the
sunniest
which
elsley
had
passed
since
he
made
secret
love
to
lucia
in
eaton
square
romantic
walks
the
company
of
a
beautiful
woman
as
ready
to
listen
as
she
was
to
talk
free
licence
to
pour
out
all
his
fancies
sure
of
admiration
if
not
of
flattery
and
pardonably
satisfied
vanity
all
these
are
comfortable
things
for
most
men
who
have
nothing
better
to
comfort
them
but
on
the
whole
this
feast
did
not
make
elsley
a
better
or
a
wiser
man
at
home
why
should
it
is
a
boy
digestion
improved
by
turning
him
loose
into
a
confectioner
shop
and
thus
the
contrast
between
what
he
chose
to
call
valencia
sympathy
and
lucia
want
of
sympathy
made
him
unfortunately
all
the
more
cross
to
her
when
they
were
alone
and
who
could
blame
the
poor
little
woman
for
saying
one
night
angrily
enough
ah
yes
valencia
valencia
is
imaginative
valencia
understands
you
valencia
sympathises
valencia
thinks
valencia
has
no
children
to
wash
and
dress
no
accounts
to
keep
no
linen
to
mend
valencia
back
does
not
ache
all
day
long
so
that
she
would
be
glad
enough
to
lie
on
the
sofa
from
morning
till
night
if
she
was
not
forced
to
work
whether
she
can
work
or
not
no
no
do
kiss
me
for
kisses
will
not
make
up
for
injustice
elsley
i
only
trust
that
you
will
not
tempt
me
to
hate
my
own
sister
no
do
talk
to
me
now
let
me
sleep
if
i
can
sleep
and
go
and
walk
and
talk
sentiment
with
valencia
and
leave
the
poor
little
brood
hen
to
sit
on
her
nest
and
be
despised
and
refusing
all
elsley
entreaties
for
pardon
she
sulked
herself
to
sleep
who
can
blame
her
if
there
is
one
thing
more
provoking
than
another
to
a
woman
it
is
to
see
her
husband
an
angel
of
courtesy
to
every
woman
but
herself
to
see
him
in
society
all
smiles
and
good
stories
the
most
amiable
and
of
men
perhaps
to
be
complimented
on
his
agreeableness
and
to
know
all
the
while
that
he
is
penning
up
all
the
accumulated
of
the
day
to
let
it
out
on
her
when
they
get
home
perhaps
in
the
very
carriage
as
soon
as
it
leaves
the
door
hypocrites
that
you
are
some
of
you
gentlemen
why
can
not
the
act
against
cruelty
to
women
corporal
punishment
included
be
brought
to
bear
on
such
as
you
and
yet
after
all
you
are
not
most
to
blame
in
the
matter
eve
herself
tempts
you
as
at
the
beginning
for
who
does
not
know

and
he
is
a
splendid
fellow
and
he
was
made
splendid
for
some
purpose
surely
why
did
nature
give
him
his
coat
and
his
crimson
crest
but
for
the
very
same
purpose
that
she
gave
a
his
intellect
to
be
admired
by
the
other

young

femmes
of

to
perhaps
do
now
form
a

of

dear

female

what
are
their
woes
compared
to
those
of

what
higher
vocation
for
a
young
maiden
than
to
comfort
the
martyr
during
his
agonies
and
most
of
all
where
the
sufferer
is
not
merely
a
genius
but
a
saint
persecuted
perhaps
abroad
by
vulgar
tradesmen
and
philistine
bishops
and
snubbed
at

by
a
stupid
wife

is

by
misery

on

of
the
day

she

at

she
will
not

you

you
well
and
she
thinks
in

that
you
do
not
understand
her
and
her
married
joys
and
sorrows
and
her
five
children
and
her
butcher
bills

her
long
agony
of
fear
for

she
is
ten
times
more
proud
than

for

fall
into
disgrace
when
you
had
flounced
off
to
find
some
new
idol
and
so
she
will
not
tell
you
and
what
the
ear
heareth
not
that

heart
grieveth
go
on
and
prosper
you
may
too
ruin
the
spiritual
state
by
vanity
you
may
pamper
his
discontent
with
the
place
where
god
has
put
him
till
he
ends
by
flying
off
to
some
purer
communion
and
taking
you
with
him
never
mind
he
is
a
most
delightful
person
and
his
intercourse
is
so
improving
why
were
sweet
things
made
but
to
be
eaten
go
on
and
prosper
ah
young
ladies
if
some
people
had
as
it
is
perhaps
well
for
them
that
they
have
not
the
ordering
of
this
same
british
nation
they
would
certainly
follow
your
example
and
try
to
restore
various
ancient
institutions
and
first
among
them
would
be
that
very
ancient
institution
of
the
to
be
employed
however
not
as
of
old
against
married
scolds
for
whom
those
who
have
been
behind
the
scenes
have
all
respect
and
sympathy
but
against
unmarried
prophetesses
who
under
whatsoever
high
pretence
of
art
or
religion
flirt
with
their
neighbours
husbands
be
they
parson
or
poet
not
be
it
understood
that
valencia
had
the
least
suspicion
that
elsley
considered
himself
incompris
if
he
had
hinted
the
notion
to
her
she
would
have
resented
it
as
an
insult
to
the
justs
in
general
and
to
her
sister
in
particular
and
would
have
said
something
to
him
in
her
way
the
like
whereof
he
had
seldom
heard
even
from
adverse
reviewers
elsley
himself
soon
divined
enough
of
her
character
to
see
that
he
must
keep
his
sorrows
to
himself
if
he
wished
for
valencia
good
opinion
and
soon
so
easily
does
a
vain
man
lend
himself
to
meanness
he
found
himself
trying
to
please
valencia
by
praising
to
her
the
very
woman
with
whom
he
was
discontented
he
felt
shocked
and
ashamed
when
first
his
own
baseness
flashed
across
him
but
the
bait
was
too
pleasant
to
be
left
easily
and
after
all
he
was
trying
to
say
to
his
guest
what
he
knew
his
guest
would
like
and
what
was
that
but
following
those
very
rules
of
good
society
for
breaking
which
lucia
was
always
calling
him
gauche
and
morose
so
he
actually
quieted
his
own
conscience
by
the
fancy
that
he
was
bound
to
be
civil
and
to
keep
up
appearances
even
for
lucia
sake
said
the
to
himself
and
thus
the
mischief
was
done
and
the
breach
between
lucia
and
her
husband
which
had
been
somewhat
bridged
over
during
the
last
month
or
two
opened
more
wide
than
ever
without
a
suspicion
on
valencia
part
that
she
was
doing
all
she
could
to
break
her
heart
she
meanwhile
had
plenty
of
reasons
which
justified
her
new
intimacy
to
herself
how
could
she
better
please
lucia
how
better
show
that
bygones
were
to
be
bygones
and
that
elsley
was
henceforth
to
be
considered
as
one
of
the
family
than
by
being
as
intimate
as
possible
with
him
what
matter
how
intimate
for
after
all
he
was
only
a
brother
and
she
his
sister
she
had
law
on
her
side
in
that
last
argument
as
well
as
love
of
amusement
whether
she
had
either
common
sense
or
scripture
is
a
very
different
question
poor
lucia
too
tried
to
make
the
best
of
the
matter
and
to
take
the
new
intimacy
as
valencia
would
have
had
her
take
it
in
the
light
of
a
compliment
to
herself
and
so
in
her
pride
she
said
to
valencia
and
told
her
that
she
should
love
her
for
ever
for
her
kindness
to
elsley
while
her
heart
was
ready
to
burst
but
ere
the
fortnight
was
over
the
nemesis
had
come
and
lucia
woman
as
she
was
could
not
repress
a
thrill
of
malicious
joy
even
though
elsley
became
more
intolerable
than
ever
at
the
change
what
was
the
nemesis
then
simply
that
this
naughty
miss
just
began
to
smile
upon
frank
headley
the
curate
even
as
she
had
smiled
upon
elsley
vavasour
it
was
very
naughty
but
she
had
her
excuses
she
had
found
elsley
out
and
it
was
well
for
both
of
them
that
she
had
done
so
already
upon
the
strength
of
their
supposed
relationship
she
had
allowed
him
to
talk
a
great
deal
more
nonsense
to
her
harmless
perhaps
but
nonsense
still
than
she
would
have
listened
to
from
any
other
man
and
it
was
well
for
both
of
them
that
elsley
was
a
man
without
who
began
to
show
the
weak
side
of
his
character
freely
enough
as
soon
as
he
became
at
ease
with
his
companion
and
excited
by
conversation
valencia
quickly
saw
that
he
was
vain
as
a
peacock
and
weak
enough
to
be
led
by
her
in
any
and
every
direction
when
she
chose
to
work
on
his
vanity
and
she
despised
him
accordingly
and
suspected
too
that
her
sister
could
not
be
very
happy
with
such
a
man
none
are
more
quick
than
to
see
faults
in
the
when
once
they
have
begun
to
look
for
them
and
valencia
soon
remarked
that
elsley
showed
lucia
no
while
he
was
ready
enough
to
show
them
to
her
that
he
took
no
real
trouble
about
his
children
or
about
anything
else
and
twenty
more
faults
which
she
might
have
perceived
in
the
first
two
days
of
her
visit
if
she
had
not
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
amuse
herself
but
she
was
too
delicate
to
ask
lucia
the
truth
and
contented
herself
with
watching
all
parties
closely
and
in
amusing
herself
meanwhile
for
amusement
she
must
have
in
breaking
a
country
heart
for
pastime
ere
she
went
to
town
she
had
met
frank
several
times
about
the
parish
and
in
the
schools
and
had
been
struck
at
once
with
his
grace
and
high
breeding
and
with
that
air
of
melancholy
which
is
always
interesting
in
a
true
eyes
she
had
seen
too
that
elsley
tried
to
avoid
him
naturally
enough
not
wishing
an
intrusion
on
their
pleasant
whereon
half
to
spite
elsley
and
half
to
show
her
own
right
to
chat
with
whom
she
chose
she
made
lucia
ask
frank
to
tea
and
next
contrived
to
go
to
the
school
when
he
was
teaching
there
and
to
make
elsley
ask
him
to
walk
with
them
and
all
the
more
because
she
had
discovered
that
elsley
had
discontinued
his
walks
with
frank
as
soon
as
she
had
appeared
at
penalva
lucia
was
not
sorry
to
countenance
her
in
her
naughtiness
it
was
a
comfort
to
her
to
have
a
fourth
person
in
the
room
at
times
and
thus
to
compel
elsley
and
valencia
to
think
of
something
beside
each
other
and
when
she
saw
her
sister
gradually
transferring
her
favours
from
the
married
to
the
unmarried
victim
she
would
have
been
more
than
woman
if
she
had
not
rejoiced
thereat
only
she
began
soon
to
be
afraid
for
frank
and
at
last
told
valencia
so
do
take
care
that
you
do
not
break
his
heart
my
dear
you
forget
that
i
sit
under
and
am
to
him
as
a
heathen
and
a
publican
fresh
from
nepomuc
as
he
is
he
would
as
soon
think
of
falling
in
love
with
an
prodestant
as
with
a
malignant
and
a
turbaned
turk
besides
my
dear
if
the
mischief
is
going
to
be
done
it
done
already
i
dare
say
it
is
you
naughty
beautiful
thing
if
anybody
is
goose
enough
to
fall
in
love
with
you
he
be
also
goose
enough
i
doubt
to
do
so
at
first
sight
there
do
look
perpetually
in
that
glass
but
take
care
what
use
if
it
is
going
to
happen
at
all
i
say
it
has
happened
already
so
i
shall
just
please
myself
as
usual
and
it
had
happened
and
poor
frank
had
been
ever
since
the
first
day
he
saw
valencia
over
head
and
ears
in
love
his
time
had
come
and
there
was
no
escaping
his
fate
but
to
escape
he
tried
convinced
with
many
good
men
of
all
ages
and
creeds
that
a
celibate
life
was
the
fittest
one
for
a
clergyman
he
had
fled
from
nepomuc
into
the
wilderness
to
avoid
temptation
and
beheld
at
his
a
fairer
fiend
than
ever
came
to
dunstan
a
fairer
fiend
no
doubt
for
dunstan
imagination
created
his
temptress
for
him
but
valencia
was
a
reality
and
fact
and
nature
may
be
safely
backed
to
produce
something
more
charming
than
any
monk
brain
can
do
one
questions
whether
apparition
was
not
something
as
coarse
as
his
own
mind
clever
though
that
mind
was
at
least
he
would
never
have
had
the
heart
to
apply
the
hot
tongs
to
such
a
nose
as
valencia
but
at
most
have
bowed
her
out
pityingly
as
frank
tried
to
bow
out
valencia
from
the
sacred
place
of
his
heart
but
failed
hard
he
tried
and
humbly
too
he
had
no
proud
contempt
for
married
parsons
he
was
ready
enough
to
confess
that
he
too
might
be
weak
in
that
respect
as
in
a
hundred
others
he
conceived
that
he
had
no
reason
from
his
own
inner
life
to
believe
himself
worthy
of
any
higher
vocation
proving
his
own
real
nobleness
of
soul
by
that
very
humility
he
had
rather
not
marry
he
might
do
so
some
day
but
he
would
sacrifice
much
to
avoid
the
necessity
if
he
was
weak
he
would
use
what
strength
he
had
to
the
uttermost
ere
he
yielded
and
all
the
more
because
he
felt
and
reasonably
enough
that
valencia
was
the
last
woman
in
the
world
to
make
a
parson
wife
he
had
his
ideal
of
what
such
a
wife
should
be
if
she
were
to
be
allowed
to
exist
at
all
the
same
ideal
which
paget
has
drawn
in
his
charming
little
book
would
that
all
parsons
wives
would
read
and
perpend
the
owlet
of
owlstone
edge
but
valencia
would
surely
not
make
a
beatrice
beautiful
she
was
glorious
lovable
but
not
the
helpmeet
whom
he
needed
and
he
fought
against
the
new
dream
like
a
brave
man
he
fasted
he
wept
he
prayed
but
his
prayers
seemed
not
to
be
heard
valencia
seemed
to
have
enthroned
herself
a
true
venus
victrix
in
the
centre
of
his
heart
and
would
not
be
dispossessed
he
tried
to
avoid
seeing
her
but
even
for
that
he
had
not
strength
more
miserable
each
time
as
fierce
against
himself
and
his
own
weakness
as
if
he
had
given
way
to
wine
or
to
oaths
in
vain
too
he
represented
to
himself
the
ridiculous
hopelessness
of
his
passion
the
impossibility
of
the
london
beauty
ever
stooping
to
marry
the
poor
country
curate
fancies
would
come
in
how
such
things
strange
as
they
might
seem
had
happened
already
might
happen
again
it
was
a
class
of
marriages
for
which
he
had
always
felt
a
strong
dislike
even
suspicion
and
contempt
and
though
he
was
far
more
fitted
in
family
as
well
as
personal
excellence
for
such
a
match
than
three
out
of
four
who
make
them
yet
he
shrank
with
disgust
from
the
notion
of
being
himself
classed
at
last
among
the
parsons
whether
there
was
carnal
pride
or
not
in
that
last
thought
his
soul
so
loathed
it
that
he
would
gladly
have
thrown
up
his
cure
at
aberalva
and
would
have
done
so
actually
but
for
one
word
which
tom
thurnall
had
spoken
to
him
and
that
was
cholera
that
the
cholera
might
come
that
it
probably
would
come
in
the
course
of
the
next
two
months
was
news
to
him
which
was
enough
to
keep
him
at
his
post
let
what
would
be
the
consequence
and
gradually
he
began
to
see
a
way
out
of
his
difficulty
and
a
very
simple
one
and
that
was
to
die
that
is
the
solution
after
all
said
he
i
am
not
strong
enough
for
god
work
but
i
will
not
shrink
from
it
if
i
can
help
if
i
can
not
master
it
let
it
kill
me
so
at
least
i
may
have
peace
i
have
failed
utterly
here
all
my
grand
plans
have
crumbled
to
ashes
between
my
fingers
i
find
myself
a
cumberer
of
the
ground
where
i
fancied
that
i
was
going
forth
like
a
very
michael
fool
that
i
was
leader
of
the
armies
of
heaven
and
now
in
the
one
remaining
point
on
which
i
thought
myself
strong
i
find
myself
weakest
of
all
useless
and
helpless
i
have
one
chance
left
one
chance
to
show
these
poor
souls
that
i
really
love
them
really
wish
their
good
selfish
that
i
am
what
matter
whether
i
do
show
it
or
not
what
need
to
justify
myself
to
them
self
self
creeping
in
everywhere
i
shall
begin
next
i
suppose
longing
for
the
cholera
to
come
that
i
may
show
off
myself
in
it
and
make
spiritual
capital
out
of
their
dying
agonies
ah
me
that
it
were
all
over
that
this
cholera
if
it
is
to
come
would
wipe
out
of
this
head
what
i
verily
believe
nothing
but
death
will
do
and
therewith
frank
laid
his
head
on
the
table
and
cried
till
he
could
cry
no
more
it
was
not
over
manly
but
he
was
weakened
with
overwork
and
sorrow
and
on
the
whole
it
was
perhaps
the
best
thing
he
could
do
for
he
fell
asleep
there
with
his
head
on
the
table
and
did
not
wake
till
the
dawn
blazed
through
his
open
window
chapter
xiv
the
doctor
at
bay
did
you
ever
in
a
feverish
dream
climb
a
mountain
which
grew
higher
and
higher
as
you
climbed
and
scramble
through
passages
which
changed
perpetually
before
you
and
up
and
down
stairs
which
broke
off
perpetually
behind
you
did
you
ever
spend
the
whole
night
foot
in
stirrup
mounting
that
phantom
hunter
which
never
gets
mounted
or
if
he
does
turns
into
a
pen
between
your
knees
or
in
going
to
fish
that
phantom
stream
which
never
gets
fished
did
you
ever
late
for
that
mysterious
in
some
enchanted
castle
wander
disconsolately
in
unaccountable
rags
and
dirt
in
search
of
that
phantom
which
never
gets
found
did
you
ever
realise
to
yourself
the
sieve
of
the
danaides
the
stone
of
sisyphus
the
wheel
of
ixion
the
pleasure
of
shearing
that
domestic
animal
who
according
to
the
experience
of
a
very
ancient
observer
of
nature
produces
more
cry
than
wool
the
perambulation
of
that
irishman
model
bog
where
you
slip
two
steps
backward
for
one
forward
and
must
therefore
in
order
to
progress
at
all
turn
your
face
homeward
and
progress
as
a
pig
does
into
a
steamer
by
going
the
opposite
way
were
you
ever
condemned
to
spin
ropes
of
sand
to
all
eternity
like
tregeagle
the
wrecker
or
to
extract
the
cube
roots
of
a
million
or
two
of
hopeless
surds
like
the
mad
mathematician
or
last
and
worst
of
all
to
work
the
nuisances
removal
act
then
you
can
enter
as
a
man
and
a
brother
into
the
sorrows
of
tom
thurnall
in
the
months
of
june
and
july
he
had
made
up
his
mind
for
certain
good
reasons
of
his
own
that
the
cholera
ought
to
visit
aberalva
in
the
course
of
the
summer
and
of
course
tried
his
best
to
persuade
people
to
get
ready
for
their
ugly
visitor
but
in
vain
the
cholera
come
there
why
it
never
had
come
yet
which
signified
when
he
inquired
a
little
more
closely
that
there
had
been
only
one
or
two
doubtful
cases
in
and
five
or
six
in
in
vain
he
answered
very
well
and
is
not
that
a
proof
that
the
causes
of
cholera
are
increasing
here
if
you
had
one
case
the
first
time
and
five
times
as
many
the
next
by
the
same
rule
you
will
have
five
times
as
many
more
if
it
comes
this
summer
nonsense
aberalva
was
the
healthiest
town
on
the
coast
well
but
would
tom
say
in
the
census
before
last
you
had
a
population
of
in
houses
and
that
was
close
packing
enough
in
all
conscience
and
in
the
last
census
i
find
you
had
a
population
of
over
which
must
have
increased
since
and
there
are
eight
or
nine
old
houses
in
the
town
pulled
down
or
turned
into
stores
so
you
are
more
closely
packed
than
ever
and
mind
it
may
seem
no
very
great
difference
but
it
is
the
last
drop
that
fills
the
cup
what
had
that
to
do
with
cholera
and
more
than
one
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
must
be
either
a
very
silly
or
a
very
impertinent
person
to
go
poking
into
how
many
houses
there
were
in
the
town
and
how
many
people
lived
in
each
tardrew
the
steward
indeed
said
openly
that
thurnall
was
making
disturbance
enough
in
property
up
at
pentremochyn
without
bothering
himself
with
aberalva
too
he
had
no
opinion
of
people
who
had
a
finger
in
everybody
pie
whom
tom
tried
to
soothe
with
honeyed
words
knowing
him
to
be
of
the
original
british
bulldog
breed
which
once
stroked
against
the
hair
shows
his
teeth
at
you
for
ever
afterwards
but
staunch
was
tardrew
unfortunately
on
the
wrong
side
and
backed
by
the
collective
ignorance
pride
laziness
and
superstition
of
aberalva
showed
to
his
new
assailant
that
terrible
front
of
stupidity
against
which
says
schiller
the
gods
themselves
fight
in
vain
does
he
think
we
was
all
fools
afore
he
came
here
that
was
the
rallying
cry
of
the
conservative
party
worshippers
of
baalzebub
god
of
flies
and
of
that
so
say
syrian
scholars
from
which
flies
are
bred
and
indeed
there
were
excuses
for
them
on
the
yankee
ground
that
there
a
deal
of
human
natur
in
man
it
is
hard
to
human
nature
to
make
all
the
humiliating
confessions
which
must
precede
sanitary
repentance
to
say
i
have
been
a
very
nasty
dirty
fellow
i
have
lived
contented
in
evil
smells
till
i
care
for
them
no
more
than
my
pig
does
i
have
refused
to
understand
broadest
hints
that
anything
which
is
so
disagreeable
is
not
meant
to
be
left
about
i
have
probably
been
more
or
less
the
cause
of
half
my
own
illnesses
and
of
of
the
illness
of
my
children
for
aught
i
know
it
is
very
much
my
fault
that
my
own
baby
has
died
of
scarlatina
and
two
or
three
of
my
tenants
of
typhus
no
hang
it
that
too
much
to
make
any
man
confess
to
i
prove
my
innocence
by
not
reforming
so
sanitary
reform
is
thrust
out
of
sight
simply
because
its
necessity
is
too
humiliating
to
the
pride
of
all
too
frightful
to
the
consciences
of
many
tom
went
to
trebooze
trebooze
you
are
a
man
of
position
in
the
county
and
own
some
houses
in
aberalva
do
you
think
you
could
use
your
influence
in
this
matter
own
some
houses
yes
and
trebooze
consigned
the
said
cottages
to
a
variety
of
unmentionable
places
cost
me
more
in
rates
than
they
bring
in
in
rent
even
if
i
get
the
rent
paid
i
should
like
to
get
a
and
blow
the
whole
lot
into
the
sea
cholera
coming
eh
d
think
it
will
he
there
before
michaelmas
i
do
pity
i
ca
clear
out
before
michaelmas
else
i
have
ejected
the
lot
and
pulled
the
houses
down
i
think
something
should
be
done
meanwhile
though
towards
cleansing
them
let
cleanse
them
themselves
soap
cheap
enough
with
your
free
trade
ai
it
no
sir
that
sort
of
talk
will
do
well
enough
for
my
lord
minchampstead
sir
the
old
jew
but
gentlemen
sir
gentlemen
that
are
with
free
trade
and
your
whig
policy
sir
you
must
give
back
their
rights
before
they
can
afford
to
throw
away
their
money
on
cottages
cottages
indeed
upstart
of
a
coming
down
here
buying
the
lands
over
our
heads
and
pretends
to
show
us
how
to
manage
our
estates
old
families
that
have
been
in
the
county
this
four
hundred
years
with
the
finest
peasantry
in
the
world
ready
to
die
for
them
sir
till
these
new
revolutionary
doctrines
came
in
pride
and
conceit
just
to
show
off
his
money
what
do
they
want
with
better
cottages
than
their
fathers
had
only
put
notions
into
their
heads
raise
above
their
station
more
they
have
more
they
want
sir
make
chartists
of
all
before
he
done
i
tell
you
what
sir
and
trebooze
attempted
a
dignified
and
dogmatic
tone
i
never
told
it
you
before
because
you
were
my
very
good
friend
sir
but
my
opinion
is
sir
that
by
what
you
doing
up
at
pentremochyn
you
just
spreading
chartism
chartism
sir
of
course
i
know
nothing
of
course
i
nobody
in
these
days
but
my
opinion
sir
and
you
got
it
by
which
motion
tom
took
little
mighty
is
envy
always
and
mighty
ignorance
but
you
become
aware
of
their
truly
titanic
grandeur
only
when
you
attempt
to
touch
their
owner
pocket
tom
tried
old
heale
but
took
as
little
in
that
quarter
heale
had
heard
of
sanitary
reform
of
course
but
he
knew
nothing
about
it
and
gave
a
general
assent
to
tom
doctrines
for
fear
of
exposing
his
own
ignorance
acting
on
them
was
a
very
different
matter
it
is
always
hard
for
an
old
medical
man
to
confess
that
anything
has
been
discovered
since
the
days
of
his
youth
and
beside
there
were
other
reasons
behind
which
heale
tried
to
avoid
giving
and
therefore
fenced
off
and
fenced
off
till
pressed
hard
by
tom
wrath
came
forth
and
truth
with
it
and
what
be
you
thinking
of
sir
to
expect
me
to
offend
all
my
best
patients
and
not
one
of
but
rents
some
two
cottages
some
a
dozen
and
what
they
say
to
me
if
i
go
a
routing
and
rookling
in
their
drains
like
an
old
sow
by
the
wayside
beside
putting
to
all
manner
of
expense
and
all
on
the
chance
of
this
cholera
coming
which
i
have
no
faith
in
nor
in
this
sanitary
reform
neither
which
is
all
a
dodge
for
a
lot
of
young
government
puppies
to
fill
their
pockets
and
rule
and
ride
over
us
and
my
opinion
always
was
with
the
bible
that
is
jidgment
sir
a
jidgment
of
god
and
we
ca
escape
his
holy
will
and
that
the
plain
truth
of
it
tom
made
no
answer
to
that
latter
argument
he
had
heard
that
is
jidgment
from
every
mouth
during
the
last
few
days
and
had
mortally
offended
the
brianite
preacher
that
very
morning
by
answering
his
is
jidgment
with
but
my
good
sir
the
bible
i
thought
says
that
aaron
stayed
the
plague
among
the
israelites
and
david
the
one
at
jerusalem
sir
those
was
miracles
sir
and
they
was
under
the
law
sir
and
we
under
the
gospel
you
be
pleased
to
remember
humph
said
tom
then
by
your
showing
they
were
better
off
under
the
law
than
we
are
now
if
they
could
have
their
plagues
stopped
by
miracles
and
we
can
not
have
ours
stopped
at
all
sir
be
you
an
infidel
to
which
there
was
no
answer
to
be
made
in
this
case
tom
answered
heale
with
but
my
dear
sir
if
you
do
like
as
is
reasonable
enough
to
take
the
responsibility
on
yourself
why
not
go
to
the
board
of
guardians
and
get
them
to
put
the
act
in
force
boord
sir
and
do
you
know
so
little
of
boords
as
that
why
there
ai
one
of
them
but
owns
cottages
themselves
and
it
as
much
as
my
place
is
worth
your
place
as
medical
officer
is
just
worth
nothing
as
you
know
you
have
been
out
of
pocket
by
it
seven
or
eight
pounds
this
year
even
if
no
cholera
comes
tom
knew
the
whole
state
of
the
case
but
he
liked
tormenting
heale
now
and
then
well
sir
but
if
i
get
turned
out
next
year
in
steps
that
drew
over
at
carcarrow
churchtown
into
my
district
and
into
the
best
of
my
practice
too
i
wonder
what
sort
of
a
poor
law
district
you
were
medical
officer
of
if
you
do
know
yet
that
that
why
we
take
to
the
poor
my
dear
sir
i
know
it
and
a
good
deal
more
beside
then
why
go
bothering
me
this
way
why
said
tom
it
pleasant
to
have
old
notions
confirmed
as
often
as
possible
is
a
jest
and
all
things
show
it
i
thought
so
once
but
now
i
know
it
what
an
ass
the
fellow
must
have
been
who
had
that
put
on
his
tombstone
not
to
have
found
it
out
many
a
year
before
he
died
he
went
next
to
headley
the
curate
and
took
little
by
that
move
though
more
than
by
any
other
for
frank
already
believed
his
doctrines
as
an
educated
london
parson
of
course
would
was
shocked
to
hear
that
they
were
likely
to
become
fact
so
soon
and
so
fearfully
offered
to
do
all
he
could
but
confessed
that
he
could
do
nothing
i
have
been
hinting
to
them
ever
since
i
came
improvements
in
cleanliness
in
ventilation
and
so
forth
but
i
have
been
utterly
unheeded
and
bully
me
as
you
will
doctor
about
my
cramming
doctrines
down
their
throats
and
roaring
like
a
pope
bull
i
assure
you
that
on
sanitary
reform
my
roaring
was
as
of
a
sucking
dove
and
ought
to
have
prevailed
if
soft
persuasion
can
you
were
a
dove
where
you
ought
to
have
been
a
bull
and
a
bull
where
you
ought
to
have
been
a
dove
but
roar
now
if
ever
you
roared
in
the
pulpit
and
out
why
not
preach
to
them
on
it
next
sunday
well
i
give
a
lecture
gladly
if
i
could
get
any
one
to
come
and
hear
it
but
that
you
could
do
better
than
me
i
lecture
them
myself
and
show
them
bogies
if
my
will
do
its
work
if
they
want
seeing
to
believe
see
they
shall
i
have
specimens
of
water
already
which
will
astonish
them
let
me
lecture
you
must
preach
you
must
know
that
there
is
a
feeling
you
would
call
it
a
prejudice
against
introducing
such
purely
secular
subjects
into
the
pulpit
tom
gave
a
long
whistle
pardon
me
headley
you
are
a
man
of
sense
and
i
can
speak
to
you
as
one
human
being
to
another
which
i
have
seldom
been
able
to
do
with
your
respected
cloth
say
on
i
shall
not
be
frightened
well
do
you
put
up
the
ten
commandments
in
your
church
yes
and
do
one
of
them
run
shalt
not
kill
well
and
is
not
murder
a
moral
offence
what
you
call
a
sin
if
you
saw
your
parishioners
in
the
habit
of
cutting
each
throats
or
their
own
should
you
think
that
a
matter
spiritual
enough
to
be
a
fit
subject
for
a
little
of
the
drum
ecclesiastic
well
well
ill
there
are
your
parishioners
about
to
commit
wholesale
murder
and
suicide
and
is
that
a
secular
question
if
they
do
know
the
fact
is
not
that
all
the
more
reason
for
your
telling
them
of
it
you
pound
away
as
i
warned
you
once
at
the
sins
of
which
they
are
just
as
well
aware
as
you
why
on
earth
do
you
hold
your
tongue
about
the
sins
of
which
they
are
not
aware
you
tell
us
every
sunday
that
we
do
heaven
only
knows
how
many
more
wrong
things
than
we
dream
of
tell
it
us
again
now
do
strain
at
gnats
like
want
of
faith
and
resignation
and
swallow
such
a
camel
as
twenty
or
thirty
deaths
it
no
concern
of
mine
i
seen
plenty
of
people
murdered
and
may
again
i
am
accustomed
to
it
but
if
it
not
your
concern
what
on
earth
you
are
here
for
is
more
than
i
can
tell
you
are
right
you
are
right
but
how
to
put
it
on
religious
grounds
tom
whistled
again
if
your
doctrines
can
not
be
made
to
fit
such
plain
matters
as
twenty
deaths
pis
pour
if
they
have
nothing
to
say
on
such
scientific
facts
why
the
facts
must
take
care
of
themselves
and
the
doctrines
may
for
aught
i
care
go
and
but
i
wo
be
really
rude
only
think
over
the
matter
if
you
are
god
minister
you
ought
to
have
something
to
say
about
god
view
of
a
fact
which
certainly
involves
the
lives
of
his
creatures
not
by
twos
and
threes
but
by
tens
of
thousands
so
frank
went
home
and
thought
it
through
and
went
once
and
again
to
thurnall
and
condescended
to
ask
his
opinion
of
what
he
had
said
and
whether
he
said
ill
or
well
what
thurnall
answered
was
whether
that
sound
church
doctrine
is
your
business
but
if
it
be
say
with
the
man
there
in
the
acts
what
was
his
name
thou
persuadest
me
to
be
a
christian
would
god
that
you
were
one
for
you
would
make
a
right
good
one
humph
at
least
you
see
what
you
can
do
if
you
only
face
fact
as
it
stands
and
talk
about
the
realities
of
life
i
puff
your
sermon
beforehand
i
assure
you
and
bring
all
i
can
to
hear
it
so
frank
preached
a
noble
sermon
most
rational
and
most
spiritual
withal
but
he
too
like
his
tutor
took
little
by
his
motion
all
the
present
fruit
upon
which
he
had
to
congratulate
himself
was
that
the
brianite
preacher
denounced
him
in
chapel
next
sunday
as
a
german
rationalist
who
impiously
pretended
to
explain
away
the
visitation
into
a
carnal
matter
of
drains
and
pipes
and
gases
and
such
like
and
that
his
rival
of
another
denomination
who
was
a
fanatic
on
the
teetotal
question
denounced
him
as
bitterly
for
supporting
the
cause
of
drunkenness
by
attributing
cholera
to
want
of
cleanliness
while
all
rational
people
knew
that
its
true
source
was
intemperance
poor
frank
he
had
preached
against
drunkenness
many
a
time
and
oft
but
because
he
would
not
add
a
mohammedan
eleventh
commandment
to
those
ten
which
men
already
find
difficulty
enough
in
keeping
he
was
set
upon
at
once
by
a
fanatic
whose
game
it
was
as
it
is
that
of
too
many
to
snub
sanitary
reform
and
hinder
the
spread
of
plain
scientific
truth
for
the
sake
of
pushing
their
own
nostrum
for
all
human
ills
in
despair
tom
went
off
to
elsley
vavasour
would
he
help
would
he
join
as
one
of
two
householders
in
making
a
representation
to
the
proper
authorities
elsley
had
never
mixed
in
local
matters
and
if
he
had
he
knew
nothing
of
how
to
manage
men
or
to
read
an
act
of
parliament
so
angry
as
tom
was
inclined
to
be
with
him
he
found
it
useless
to
quarrel
with
a
man
so
utterly
unpractical
who
would
probably
had
he
been
stirred
into
exertion
have
done
more
harm
than
good
only
come
with
me
and
satisfy
yourself
as
to
the
existence
of
one
of
these
nuisances
and
then
you
will
have
grounds
on
which
to
go
said
tom
who
had
still
hopes
of
making
a
of
elsley
and
by
his
power
over
him
pulling
the
strings
from
behind
sorely
against
his
will
elsley
went
saw
and
smelt
came
home
again
was
very
unwell
and
was
visited
nightly
for
a
week
after
that
by
that
most
disgusting
of
all
phantoms
sanitary
nightmare
which
some
who
have
worked
in
the
foul
places
of
the
earth
know
but
too
well
evidently
his
health
could
not
stand
it
there
was
no
work
to
be
got
out
of
him
in
that
direction
would
he
write
then
and
represent
matters
to
lord
scoutbush
how
could
he
he
did
not
know
the
man
not
a
line
had
ever
been
exchanged
between
them
their
relations
were
so
very
peculiar
it
would
seem
sheer
impertinence
on
his
part
to
interfere
with
the
management
of
lord
scoutbush
property
really
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
said
tom
felt
for
poor
elsley
dislike
of
meddling
in
that
quarter
would
vavasour
write
then
for
heaven
sake
do
not
mention
it
to
her
she
would
be
so
terrified
about
the
children
she
is
worn
out
with
anxiety
already
and
so
forth
tom
went
back
to
frank
headley
you
see
a
good
deal
of
miss
st
just
i
no
why
what
said
poor
frank
blushing
only
that
you
must
make
her
write
to
her
brother
about
this
cholera
my
dear
fellow
it
is
such
a
subject
for
a
lady
to
meddle
with
it
has
no
scruple
in
meddling
with
ladies
so
ladies
ought
to
have
none
in
meddling
with
it
you
must
do
it
as
delicately
as
you
will
but
done
it
must
be
it
is
our
only
chance
tell
her
of
obstinacy
or
scoutbush
will
go
by
his
opinion
and
tell
her
to
keep
the
secret
from
her
sister
frank
did
it
and
well
valencia
was
and
wrote
scoutbush
was
away
at
sea
nobody
knew
where
and
a
full
fortnight
elapsed
before
an
answer
came
my
dear
you
are
quite
mistaken
if
you
think
i
can
do
anything
of
the
houses
in
aberalva
are
not
in
my
hands
but
copyholds
and
long
leases
over
which
i
have
no
power
if
the
people
will
complain
to
me
of
any
given
nuisance
i
right
it
if
i
can
and
if
the
doctor
wants
money
and
sees
any
ways
of
laying
it
out
well
he
shall
have
what
he
wants
though
i
am
very
high
in
queer
street
just
now
having
paid
your
bills
before
i
left
town
like
a
good
brother
but
i
tell
you
again
i
have
no
more
power
than
you
have
except
over
a
few
cottages
and
tardrew
assured
me
three
weeks
ago
that
they
were
as
comfortable
as
they
ever
had
been
so
tardrew
had
forestalled
thurnall
in
writing
to
the
viscount
well
there
was
one
more
chance
to
be
tried
tom
gave
his
lecture
in
the
he
showed
them
magnified
abominations
enough
to
frighten
all
the
children
into
fits
and
dilated
on
horrors
enough
to
spoil
all
appetites
he
proved
to
them
that
though
they
had
the
finest
water
in
the
world
all
over
the
town
they
had
contrived
to
poison
almost
every
drop
of
it
he
waxed
eloquent
witty
sarcastic
and
the
net
result
was
a
general
grumble
how
did
he
get
hold
of
all
the
specimens
as
he
calls
them
what
business
has
he
poking
his
nose
down
people
wells
and
waterbutts
but
an
unexpected
ally
arose
at
this
juncture
in
the
lieutenant
who
being
valiant
after
his
evening
rose
and
declared
that
thurnall
was
a
very
clever
man
that
by
what
he
seen
himself
in
the
west
indies
it
was
all
as
true
as
gospel
that
the
parish
might
have
the
cholera
if
it
liked
and
here
a
few
expletives
occurred
but
that
he
see
that
the
houses
were
put
to
rights
at
once
for
he
would
not
have
the
lives
of
her
majesty
servants
endangered
by
such
dirty
tricks
not
fit
for
heathen
savages
etc
etc
tom
struck
while
the
iron
was
hot
he
saw
that
the
great
man
speech
had
produced
an
impression
would
he
so
he
asked
the
lieutenant
privately
get
some
one
to
join
him
and
present
a
few
of
these
nuisances
he
would
do
anything
in
his
contempt
for
a
lot
of
and
herringers
who
went
about
calling
themselves
captains
and
fancy
themselves
sir
as
good
as
if
they
wore
the
queen
uniform
well
then
ca
we
find
another
householder
some
cantankerous
dog
who
do
mind
a
row
yes
the
cantankerous
dog
was
found
in
the
person
of
john
penruddock
who
had
quarrelled
with
tardrew
because
tardrew
said
he
gave
short
weight
which
he
very
probably
did
and
had
quarrelled
also
with
thomas
beer
senior
shipbuilder
about
right
of
passage
through
a
penruddock
suddenly
discovered
that
beer
kept
up
a
in
the
said
and
with
virtuous
indignation
vowed
he
sarve
the
old
beggar
out
at
last
so
far
so
good
the
weapons
of
reason
and
righteousness
having
failed
tom
felt
at
liberty
to
borrow
the
devil
tools
now
to
pack
a
vestry
and
to
nominate
a
local
committee
the
vestry
was
packed
the
committee
nominated
of
course
half
of
them
refused
to
act
they
did
want
to
go
quarrelling
with
their
neighbours
tom
explained
to
them
cunningly
and
delicately
that
they
would
have
nothing
to
do
that
one
or
two
he
did
not
say
that
he
was
the
one
and
the
two
also
would
do
all
the
work
and
bear
all
the
odium
whereon
the
malcontents
subsided
considering
it
likely
that
after
all
nothing
would
be
done
some
may
fancy
that
matters
were
now
getting
somewhat
settled
those
who
do
so
know
little
of
the
charming
machinery
of
local
governments
one
man
has
summat
to
say
utterly
irrelevant
another
must
needs
answer
him
with
something
equally
irrelevant
a
long
chatter
ensues
in
spite
of
all
cries
to
order
and
question
soon
one
and
another
gets
personal
and
temper
shows
here
and
there
you
would
fancy
that
the
party
try
to
restore
order
and
help
business
on
not
in
the
least
they
have
begun
to
cool
a
little
they
are
a
little
afraid
that
they
have
committed
themselves
if
people
quarrel
with
each
other
perhaps
they
may
quarrel
with
them
too
and
they
begin
to
be
wonderfully
patient
and
impartial
in
the
hope
of
staving
off
the
evil
day
and
finding
some
excuse
for
doing
nothing
after
all
hear
out
vair
and
zoft
let
man
ha
his
zay
vary
gude
rason
in
it
i
did
think
of
that
avore
and
so
forth
till
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
whole
question
has
to
be
discussed
over
again
through
the
fog
of
a
dozen
fresh
fallacies
and
the
miserable
earnest
man
finds
himself
considerably
worse
off
than
when
he
began
happy
for
him
if
some
chance
word
is
not
let
drop
which
will
afford
the
whole
assembly
an
excuse
for
falling
on
him
as
the
cause
of
all
their
woes
that
chance
word
came
penruddock
gave
a
spiteful
hit
being
as
he
said
of
a
cantankerous
turn
to
treluddra
principal
jowder
fish
salesman
of
aberalva
whereon
treluddra
whose
conscience
told
him
that
there
was
at
present
in
his
a
cartload
and
more
of
fish
in
every
stage
of
putrefaction
which
he
had
kept
rotting
there
rather
than
lower
the
rose
in
wrath
an
if
any
committee
puts
its
noz
into
my
if
it
doant
get
the
biggest
cod
innards
as
i
can
collar
hold
on
about
its
ears
my
name
is
not
treluddra
a
man
house
is
his
castle
says
i
and
them
as
takes
up
with
any
o
this
burglary
for
it
nothing
less
has
to
do
wi
me
that
all
and
them
as
knows
their
interest
knows
me
terrible
were
these
words
for
old
treluddra
like
most
jowders
combined
the
profession
of
with
that
of
salesman
and
there
were
dozens
in
the
place
who
were
in
debt
to
him
for
money
advanced
to
buy
boats
and
nets
after
wreck
and
loss
besides
to
offend
one
jowder
was
to
offend
all
they
combined
to
buy
the
fish
at
any
price
they
chose
if
angered
they
would
combine
now
and
then
not
to
buy
it
at
all
you
old
twenty
per
cent
rascal
roared
the
lieutenant
after
making
a
fortune
out
of
these
poor
fellows
mishaps
do
you
want
to
poison
all
with
your
stinking
fish
i
say
lieutenant
says
old
beer
whose
son
owed
treluddra
fifty
pounds
at
that
moment
fair
fair
you
mind
your
coastguard
and
we
mind
our
trade
we
free
fishermen
by
charter
and
right
not
our
master
and
you
shall
know
it
know
it
says
the
lieutenant
foaming
iss
you
put
your
head
inside
my
presences
and
i
split
mun
open
if
i
be
hanged
for
it
you
split
my
head
open
iss
by
and
the
old
set
his
arms
akimbo
gentlemen
gentlemen
for
heaven
sake
cries
poor
headley
this
is
really
going
too
far
gentlemen
the
vestry
is
adjourned
best
thing
too
ought
never
to
have
been
called
says
one
and
another
and
some
one
as
he
went
out
muttered
something
about
interloping
strange
doctors
colloquies
with
popish
curates
which
was
answered
by
a
put
in
the
quay
pule
from
treluddra
tom
stepped
up
to
treluddra
instantly
what
were
you
so
kind
as
to
say
sir
treluddra
turned
very
pale
i
did
say
nought
oh
but
i
assure
you
i
heard
and
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
jump
into
the
quay
pule
this
afternoon
if
it
will
afford
you
the
slightest
amusement
say
the
word
and
i
borrow
a
flute
and
play
you
the
rogue
march
all
the
while
with
my
right
hand
swimming
with
my
left
now
gentlemen
one
word
before
we
part
who
be
you
cries
some
one
a
man
at
least
and
ought
to
have
a
fair
hearing
now
i
ask
you
what
possible
interest
can
i
have
in
this
matter
i
knew
when
i
began
that
i
should
give
myself
a
frightful
quantity
of
trouble
and
get
only
what
i
have
got
why
did
you
begin
at
all
then
because
i
was
a
very
foolish
meddlesome
ass
who
fancied
that
i
ought
to
do
my
duty
once
in
a
way
by
my
neighbours
now
i
have
only
to
say
that
if
you
will
but
forgive
and
forget
and
let
bygones
be
bygones
i
promise
you
solemnly
i
never
do
my
duty
by
you
again
as
long
as
i
live
nor
interfere
with
the
sacred
privilege
of
every
englishman
to
do
that
which
is
right
in
the
sight
of
his
own
eyes
and
wrong
too
you
making
fun
at
us
said
old
beer
dubiously
well
beer
and
is
that
better
than
quarrelling
with
you
come
along
we
all
go
home
and
forget
it
like
good
christians
perhaps
the
cholera
wo
come
and
if
it
does
what
the
odds
so
long
as
you
happy
eh
and
to
the
intense
astonishment
both
of
the
lieutenant
and
frank
tom
walked
home
with
the
malcontents
making
himself
so
agreeable
that
he
was
forgiven
freely
on
the
spot
what
does
the
fellow
mean
he
deserted
us
sir
after
bringing
us
here
to
make
fools
of
us
frank
could
give
no
answer
but
thurnall
gave
one
himself
that
evening
both
to
frank
and
the
lieutenant
the
cholera
will
come
and
these
fellows
are
just
mad
but
i
quarrel
with
them
mad
or
not
why
then
for
the
same
reason
that
you
must
not
if
we
keep
our
influence
we
may
be
able
to
do
some
good
at
the
last
which
means
in
plain
english
saving
a
few
human
lives
as
for
you
lieutenant
you
have
behaved
like
a
hero
and
have
been
served
as
heroes
generally
are
what
you
must
do
is
this
on
the
first
hint
of
disease
pack
up
your
traps
and
your
good
lady
and
go
and
live
in
the
across
the
river
as
for
the
men
houses
i
set
them
to
rights
in
a
day
if
you
get
the
commander
of
the
district
to
allow
you
a
little
chloride
of
lime
and
whitewash
and
so
the
matter
ended
you
are
a
greater
puzzle
than
ever
to
me
thurnall
said
frank
you
are
always
pretending
to
care
for
nothing
but
your
own
interest
and
yet
here
you
have
gone
out
of
your
way
to
incur
odium
knowing
you
say
that
your
cause
was
all
but
hopeless
well
i
do
it
because
i
like
it
it
a
sort
of
sporting
with
your
true
doctor
he
blazes
away
at
a
disease
where
he
sees
one
as
he
would
at
a
bear
or
a
lion
the
very
sight
of
it
excites
his
organ
of
destructiveness
do
you
understand
me
you
hate
sin
you
know
well
i
hate
disease
moral
evil
is
your
devil
and
physical
evil
is
mine
i
hate
it
little
or
big
i
hate
to
see
a
fellow
sick
i
hate
to
see
a
child
rickety
and
pale
i
hate
to
see
a
speck
of
dirt
in
the
street
i
hate
to
see
a
woman
gown
torn
i
hate
to
see
her
stockings
down
at

i
hate
to

anything
wasted
anything
awry
anything
going

i
hate
to
see
wasted
manure
wasted
land
wasted
muscle
wasted
pluck
wasted
brains
wasted
i
hate
neglect
incapacity
idleness
ignorance
and
all
the
disease
and
misery
which
spring
out
of
that
there
my
devil
and
i
ca
help
it
for
the
life
of
me
going
right
at
his
throat
wheresoever
i
meet
him
lastly
rather
to
clear
his
reputation
than
in
the
hope
of
doing
good
tom
wrote
up
to
london
and
detailed
the
case
to
that
body
the
general
board
of
health
informing
them
civilly
that
the
nuisances
removal
act
was
simply
waste
paper
that
he
could
not
get
it
to
bear
at
all
on
aberalva
and
that
if
he
had
done
so
it
would
have
been
equally
useless
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
constituted
the
offenders
themselves
judge
and
jury
in
their
own
case
to
which
the
board
returned
for
answer
that
they
were
perfectly
aware
of
the
fact
and
deeply
deplored
the
same
but
that
as
soon
as
cholera
broke
out
in
aberalva
they
should
be
most
happy
to
send
down
an
inspector
to
which
tom
replied
courteously
that
he
would
not
give
them
the
trouble
being
able
he
trusted
to
perform
without
assistance
the
not
uncommon
feat
of
shutting
the
after
the
horse
was
stolen
and
so
was
aberalva
left
a
virgin
city
undefiled
by
government
interference
to
the
blessings
of
that
local
government
which
signifies
in
plain
english
the
leaving
the
few
to
destroy
themselves
and
the
many
by
the
unchecked
exercise
of
the
virtues
of
pride
and
ignorance
stupidity
and
stinginess
but
to
tom
in
his
sorest
need
arose
a
new
and
most
unexpected
coadjutor
and
this
was
the
way
in
which
it
came
to
pass
for
it
befell
in
that
pleasant
summer
time
when
small
birds
sing
and
shaughs
are
green
that
thurnall
started
one
bright
sunday
eve
to
see
a
sick
child
at
an
upland
farm
some
few
miles
from
the
town
and
partly
because
he
liked
the
walk
and
partly
because
he
could
no
other
having
neither
horse
nor
gig
he
went
on
foot
and
whistled
as
he
went
like
any
along
the
pleasant
vale
by
flowery
banks
and
ferny
walls
by
oak
and
ash
and
thorn
while
alva
flashed
and
swirled
between
green
boughs
below
clear
from
last
night
rain
some
miles
up
the
turnpike
road
he
went
and
then
away
to
the
right
through
the
of
trebooze
up
by
the
rill
which
drips
from
pool
to
pool
over
the
ledges
of
grey
slate
in
dark
sedge
and
broad
bright
burdock
leaves
and
tall
angelica
and
rings
and
tufts
of
king
and
crown
and
and
all
the
luxuriance
of
the
fat
western
soil
and
steaming
western
woods
out
into
the
boggy
moor
at
the
glen
head
all
fragrant
with
the
gale
where
the
turf
is
enamelled
with
the
hectic
marsh
violet
and
the
pink
pimpernel
and
the
pale
yellow
of
the
butterwort
and
the
blue
bells
and
green
threads
of
the
campanula
out
upon
the
steep
smooth
down
above
and
away
over
the
broad
and
then
to
pause
a
moment
and
look
far
and
wide
over
land
and
sea
it
was
a
day
of
god
the
earth
lay
like
one
great
emerald
ringed
and
roofed
with
sapphire
blue
sea
blue
mountain
blue
sky
overhead
there
she
lay
not
sleeping
but
basking
in
her
quiet
sabbath
joy
as
though
her
two
great
sisters
of
the
sea
and
air
had
washed
her
weary
limbs
with
holy
tears
and
purged
away
the
stains
of
last
sin
and
toil
and
cooled
her
hot
worn
forehead
with
their
pure
and
folded
her
within
their
azure
robes
and
brooded
over
her
with
smiles
of
pitying
love
till
she
smiled
back
in
answer
and
took
heart
and
hope
for
next
week
weary
work
heart
and
hope
for
next
week
that
was
the
sermon
which
it
preached
to
tom
thurnall
as
he
stood
there
alone
a
stranger
and
a
wanderer
like
ulysses
of
old
but
like
him
cheerful
in
one
respect
indeed
he
knew
less
than
ulysses
and
was
more
of
a
heathen
than
he
for
he
knew
not
what
ulysses
knew
that
a
heavenly
guide
was
with
him
in
his
wanderings
still
less
what
ulysses
knew
not
that
what
he
called
the
malicious
sport
of
fortune
was
in
truth
the
earnest
education
of
a
father
but
who
will
blame
him
for
getting
strength
and
comfort
from
such
merely
natural
founts
or
say
that
the
impulse
came
from
below
and
not
from
above
which
made
him
say
brave
old
world
she
is
after
all
and
right
well
made
and
looks
right
well
in
her
clothes
and
plenty
of
room
and
chance
in
her
for
a
brave
man
to
earn
his
bread
if
he
will
but
go
right
on
about
his
business
as
the
birds
and
the
flowers
do
instead
of
peaking
and
pining
over
what
people
think
of
him
like
that
miserable
briggs
hark
to
that
jolly
old
below
he
had
his
nest
to
build
and
his
supper
to
earn
and
his
young
ones
to
feed
and
all
the
crows
and
kites
in
the
wood
to
drive
away
the
sturdy
john
bull
that
he
is
and
yet
he
can
find
time
to
sing
as
merrily
as
an
abbot
morning
and
evening
since
he
sang
the
new
year
in
last
january
and
why
should
not
i
let
him
be
a
while
there
are
sounds
of
deeper
meaning
in
the
air
if
his
heart
had
ears
to
hear
them
far
off
chiming
to
floating
up
the
glen
from
the
little
chapel
in
the
vale
he
may
learn
what
they
too
mean
some
day
honour
to
him
at
least
that
he
has
learnt
what
the
below
can
tell
him
if
he
accept
cheerfully
and
manfully
the
things
which
he
does
see
he
will
be
all
the
more
able
to
enter
hereafter
into
the
deeper
mystery
of
things
unseen
the
road
toward
true
faith
and
reverence
for
god
kingdom
of
heaven
does
not
lie
through
manichaean
contempt
and
slander
of
god
kingdom
of
earth
so
let
him
stride
over
the
down
enjoying
the
mere
fact
of
life
and
health
and
strength
and
whistling
shrilly
to
the
bird
below
who
trumpets
out
a
few
grand
ringing
notes
and
repeats
them
again
and
again
in
saucy
and
then
stops
to
listen
for
the
answer
to
this
challenge
and
then
rattles
on
again
with
a
fresh
passage
more
saucily
than
ever
in
a
tone
which
seems
to
ask
you
could
sing
that
eh
but
can
you
sing
this
my
fine
fellow
on
the
down
above
so
he
seems
to
tom
to
say
and
tickled
with
the
fancy
tom
laughs
and
whistles
and
laughs
and
has
just
time
to
compose
his
features
as
he
steps
up
to
the
gate
let
him
be
i
say
again
he
might
have
better
sunday
thoughts
perhaps
he
will
have
some
day
at
least
he
is
a
man
and
a
brave
one
and
as
the
greater
contains
the
less
surely
before
a
man
can
be
a
good
man
he
must
be
a
brave
one
first
much
more
a
man
at
all
cowards
old
odin
held
inevitably
went
to
the
very
bottom
of
and
by
no
possibility
unless
of
course
they
became
brave
at
last
could
rise
out
of
that
everlasting
bog
but
sank
whining
lower
and
lower
like
mired
cattle
to
all
eternity
in
the
unfathomable
and
if
the
chapter
of
the
book
of
revelation
and
the
eighth
verse
is
to
be
taken
as
it
stands
their
doom
has
not
altered
since
odin
time
unless
to
become
still
worse
tom
came
up
over
the
and
through
the
through
the
and
stopped
at
last
at
the
porch
the
front
door
was
open
and
the
door
beyond
it
and
ere
he
knocked
he
stopped
looking
in
silence
at
a
picture
which
held
him
spellbound
for
a
moment
by
its
rich
and
yet
quiet
beauty
tom
was
no
artist
and
knew
no
more
of
painting
in
spite
of
his
old
friendship
with
claude
than
was
to
be
expected
of
a
keen
and
observant
naturalist
who
had
seen
half
the
globe
indeed
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
snubbing
claude
profession
and
of
arriving
on
grounds
at
a
by
no
means
conclusion
a
picture
you
say
is
worth
nothing
unless
you
copy
nature
but
you
ca
copy
her
she
is
ten
times
more
gorgeous
than
any
man
can
dare
represent
her
ergo
every
picture
is
a
failure
and
the
nearest
is
worth
all
your
galleries
together
a
syllogism
of
sharp
edge
which
he
would
back
up
by
byron
i
seen
much
finer
women
ripe
and
real
than
all
the
nonsense
of
their
stone
ideal
but
here
was
one
of
nature
own
pictures
drawn
and
coloured
by
more
than
mortal
hand
and
framed
over
and
above
ready
to
his
eye
by
the
square
of
the
dark
doorway
beyond
which
all
was
flooded
with
the
full
glory
of
the
low
sun
a
dark
ceiling
walls
of
pale
an
open
window
showing
a
corner
of
rich
wall
enamelled
with
golden
lichens
orange
and
green
combs
of
polypody
pink
and
grey
tufts
of
pellitory
all
glowing
in
the
sunlight
above
the
rose
a
bush
of
roses
a
tall
spire
of
blue
monkshood
and
one
head
of
scarlet
lychnis
like
a
spark
of
fire
and
behind
all
the
dark
blue
sea
which
faded
into
the
sky
at
the
window
stood
a
sofa
of
old
maroon
leather
its
dark
hue
throwing
out
in
strong
relief
two
figures
who
sat
upon
it
and
when
tom
had
once
looked
at
them
he
looked
at
nothing
else
there
sat
the
sick
girl
her
head
nestling
upon
the
shoulder
of
grace
harvey
a
tall
delicate
thing
of
seventeen
with
thin
white
cheeks
the
hectic
spot
aflame
on
each
and
long
fair
curls
which
mingled
lovingly
with
grace
dark
tresses
as
they
sat
cheek
against
cheek
and
hand
in
hand
her
eyes
were
closed
tom
thought
at
first
that
she
was
asleep
but
there
was
a
quiet
smile
about
her
pale
lips
and
every
now
and
then
her
left
hand
left
grace
to
move
toward
a
leaf
full
of
strawberries
which
lay
on
grace
lap
and
tom
could
see
that
she
was
listening
intently
to
grace
who
told
and
told
in
that
sweet
measured
voice
of
hers
her
head
erect
her
face
in
the
full
blaze
of
sunshine
her
great
eyes
looking
out
far
away
beyond
the
sea
beyond
the
sky
into
some
infinite
which
only
she
beheld
tom
had
approached
unheard
across
the
straw
he
stood
and
looked
his
fill
the
attitude
of
the
two
girls
was
so
graceful
that
he
was
loth
to
disturb
it
and
loth
too
to
disturb
a
certain
sunny
calm
which
warmed
at
once
and
softened
his
stout
heart
he
wished
too
he
scarce
knew
why
to
hear
what
grace
was
saying
and
as
he
listened
her
voice
was
so
distinct
and
delicate
in
its
modulations
that
every
word
came
clearly
to
his
ear
it
was
the
beautiful
old
legend
of
dorothea
so
they
did
all
sorts
of
dreadful
things
to
her
and
then
led
her
away
to
die
and
they
stood
laughing
there
but
after
a
little
time
there
came
a
boy
the
prettiest
boy
that
ever
was
seen
on
earth
and
in
his
hand
a
basket
full
of
fruits
and
flowers
more
beautiful
than
tongue
can
tell
and
he
said
sends
you
these
out
of
the
heavenly
garden
which
she
told
you
of
will
you
believe
her
now
and
then
before
they
could
reply
he
vanished
away
and
theophilus
looked
at
the
flowers
and
tasted
the
fruit
and
a
new
heart
grew
up
within
him
and
he
said
god
shall
be
my
god
and
i
will
die
for
him
like
her
so
you
see
darling
there
are
sweeter
fruits
than
these
and
gayer
flowers
in
the
place
to
which
you
go
and
all
the
lovely
things
in
this
world
here
will
seem
quite
poor
and
worthless
beside
the
glory
of
that
better
land
which
he
will
show
you
and
yet
you
will
not
care
to
look
at
them
for
the
sight
of
him
will
be
enough
and
you
will
care
to
think
of
nothing
else
and
you
are
sure
he
will
accept
me
after
all
asked
the
sick
girl
opening
her
eyes
and
looking
up
at
grace
she
saw
thurnall
standing
in
the
doorway
and
gave
a
little
scream
tom
came
forward
bowing
i
am
very
sorry
to
have
disturbed
you
i
suspect
miss
harvey
was
giving
you
better
medicine
than
i
can
give
now
why
did
tom
say
that
to
whom
the
legend
of
dorothea
and
indeed
that
whole
belief
in
a
better
land
was
as
a
dream
fit
only
for
girls
not
altogether
because
he
must
need
say
something
civil
true
he
felt
on
the
whole
about
the
future
state
as
goethe
did
to
the
able
man
this
world
is
not
dumb
why
should
he
ramble
off
into
eternity
such
incomprehensible
subjects
lie
too
far
off
and
only
disturb
our
thoughts
if
made
the
subject
of
daily
meditation
that
there
was
a
future
state
he
had
no
doubt
our
having
been
born
once
he
used
to
say
is
the
strongest
possible
presumption
in
favour
of
our
being
born
again
and
probably
as
nature
always
works
upward
and
develops
higher
forms
in
some
higher
state
indeed
for
aught
he
knew
the
old
ichthyosaurs
and
plesiosaurs
might
be
alive
now
as
lions
or
as
men
he
himself
indeed
he
had
said
ere
now
had
been
probably
a
pterodactyle
of
the
lias
neither
fish
flesh
nor
good
red
herring
but
crocodile
and
bat
in
one
able
alike
to
swim
or
run
or
fly
eat
anything
and
live
in
any
element
still
it
was
no
concern
of
his
he
was
here
and
here
was
his
business
he
had
not
thought
of
this
life
before
he
came
into
it
and
it
would
be
time
enough
to
think
of
the
next
life
when
he
got
into
it
besides
he
had
all
a
doctor
dislike
of
those
terrors
of
the
unseen
world
with
which
some
men
are
wont
to
oppress
still
more
failing
nature
and
break
the
bruised
reed
his
business
was
to
cure
his
patients
bodies
and
if
he
could
not
do
that
at
least
to
see
that
life
was
not
shortened
in
them
by
nervous
depression
and
anxiety
accustomed
to
see
men
of
every
character
die
under
every
possible
circumstance
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
safety
of
a
man
soul
could
by
no
possibility
be
inferred
from
his
temper
the
vast
majority
good
or
bad
died
in
peace
why
not
let
them
die
so
if
nature
kindly
took
off
the
edge
of
sorrow
by
blunting
the
nervous
system
what
right
had
man
to
interfere
with
so
merciful
an
arrangement
every
man
he
held
in
his
easy
optimism
would
go
where
he
ought
to
go
and
it
could
be
no
possible
good
to
him
indeed
it
might
be
a
very
bad
thing
for
him
as
in
this
life
to
go
where
he
ought
not
to
go
so
he
used
to
argue
with
of
mankind
mingling
truth
and
falsehood
and
would
on
these
grounds
have
done
his
best
to
turn
the
dissenting
preacher
out
of
that
house
had
he
found
him
in
it
but
he
was
in
a
more
lenient
perhaps
in
a
more
human
and
therefore
more
spiritual
mood
it
was
all
very
well
for
him
full
of
life
and
power
and
hope
to
look
on
death
in
that
cold
careless
way
but
for
that
poor
young
thing
cut
off
just
as
life
opened
from
all
that
made
life
lovely
was
not
death
for
her
a
painful
ugly
anomaly
could
she
be
blamed
if
she
shuddered
at
going
forth
into
the
unknown
blank
she
knew
not
whither
all
very
well
for
the
old
emperor
of
rome
who
had
lived
his
life
and
done
his
work
to
play
with
the
dreary
question
animula
vagula
blandula
hospes
comesque
corporis
quae
nunc
abibis
in
loca
rigidula
nudula
pallida
but
she
who
had
lived
no
life
and
done
no
work
only
had
pined
through
weary
years
of
hideous
suffering
crippled
and
ulcerated
with
scrofula
now
dying
of
consumption
was
it
not
a
merciful
dream
a
beautiful
dream
a
just
dream
so
beautiful
and
just
that
perhaps
it
might
be
true
that
in
some
fairer
world
all
this
and
more
might
be
made
up
to
her
if
not
was
it
not
a
mistake
and
an
injustice
that
she
should
ever
have
come
into
the
world
at
all
and
was
not
grace
doing
a
rational
as
well
as
a
loving
work
in
telling
her
under
whatsoever
symbols
that
such
a
home
of
rest
and
beauty
awaited
her
it
was
not
the
sort
of
place
to
which
he
expected
perhaps
even
wished
to
go
but
it
fitted
well
enough
with
a
young
girl
hopes
a
young
girl
powers
of
enjoyment
let
it
be
perhaps
there
was
such
a
place
why
not
fitted
for
dorothea
and
those
cut
off
in
youth
like
her
and
other
places
fit
for
such
as
he
and
he
spoke
more
tenderly
than
usual
though
he
was
never
untender
as
he
said
and
you
feel
better
i
am
sure
you
must
with
such
a
kind
friend
to
tell
you
such
sweet
tales
i
do
not
feel
better
thank
you
and
why
should
i
wish
to
do
so
you
all
take
too
much
trouble
about
me
why
do
you
want
to
keep
me
here
we
are
loth
to
lose
you
and
besides
while
you
can
be
kept
here
it
is
a
sign
that
you
ought
to
be
here
so
grace
tells
me
yes
i
will
be
patient
and
wait
till
he
has
done
his
work
i
am
more
patient
now
am
i
not
grace
and
she
fondled
grace
hand
and
looked
up
in
her
face
yes
said
grace
who
was
standing
near
with
downcast
face
trying
to
avoid
tom
eye
yes
you
are
very
good
but
you
must
not
talk
but
the
girl
went
on
with
kindling
eye
ah
i
was
very
fretful
at
first
because
i
could
not
go
to
heaven
at
once
but
grace
showed
me
how
it
was
good
to
be
here
as
well
as
there
as
long
as
he
thought
that
i
might
be
made
perfect
by
sufferings
and
since
then
my
pain
has
become
quite
pleasant
to
me
and
i
am
ready
to
wait
and
bear
wait
and
bear
you
must
not
talk
see
you
are
beginning
to
cough
said
tom
who
wished
somehow
to
stop
a
form
of
thought
which
so
utterly
puzzled
him
not
that
he
had
not
heard
it
before
commonplace
enough
indeed
it
is
thank
god
but
that
day
the
words
came
home
to
him
with
spirit
and
power
all
the
more
solemnly
from
their
contrast
with
the
scene
around
without
all
sunshine
joy
and
glory
all
which
could
tempt
a
human
being
to
linger
here
and
within
that
young
girl
longing
to
leave
it
all
and
yet
content
to
stay
and
suffer
what
mysteries
there
were
in
the
human
spirit
mysteries
to
which
that
knowledge
of
mankind
on
which
he
prided
himself
gave
him
no
key
what
if
i
were
laid
on
my
back
for
life
by
a
fall
a
blow
as
i
have
seen
many
a
better
man
than
me
should
i
not
wish
to
have
one
to
talk
to
me
as
she
was
talking
to
that
child
and
for
a
moment
a
yearning
after
grace
came
over
him
as
it
had
done
before
and
swept
from
his
mind
the
dark
cloud
of
suspicion
now
i
must
talk
with
your
mother
said
he
for
you
have
better
company
than
mine
and
i
hear
her
just
coming
in
he
settled
little
matters
for
his
patient
comfort
with
the
wife
when
he
returned
to
bid
her
grace
was
gone
i
hope
i
have
not
driven
her
away
oh
no
she
had
been
here
an
hour
and
she
must
go
back
now
to
get
her
mother
supper
that
is
a
good
girl
said
tom
looking
after
her
as
she
went
down
the
field
she
an
angel
from
heaven
sir
not
a
three
days
go
over
without
her
walking
up
here
all
this
way
after
her
work
to
comfort
my
poor
maid
and
all
of
us
as
well
it
like
the
dew
of
heaven
upon
us
pity
sir
you
did
see
her
home
i
should
have
liked
it
well
enough
but
folks
might
talk
if
two
young
people
were
seen
walking
together
sunday
evening
oh
sir
they
know
her
too
well
by
now
for
miles
round
and
you
too
sir
i
make
bold
to
say
well
at
least
i
go
after
her
so
tom
went
and
kept
grace
in
sight
till
she
had
crossed
the
little
moor
and
disappeared
in
the
wood
below
he
had
gone
about
a
hundred
yards
into
the
wood
when
he
heard
voices
and
laughter
then
a
loud
shriek
he
hurried
forward
in
another
minute
grace
rushed
up
to
him
her
eyes
wide
with
terror
and
indignation
what
is
it
cried
he
trying
to
stop
her
but
not
seeming
to
see
him
she
dashed
past
him
and
ran
on
another
moment
and
a
man
appeared
in
full
pursuit
it
was
trebooze
of
trebooze
an
evil
laugh
upon
his
face
tom
planted
himself
across
the
narrow
path
in
an
attitude
which
there
was
no
mistaking
not
a
word
passed
between
them
silently
and
instinctively
like
two
fierce
dogs
the
two
men
flew
upon
each
other
tom
full
of
righteous
wrath
and
trebooze
of
passion
turned
to
fury
by
the
interruption
he
was
a
far
taller
and
heavier
man
than
thurnall
and
as
the
bully
of
the
neighbourhood
counted
on
an
easy
victory
but
he
was
mistaken
after
the
first
rush
was
over
he
found
it
impossible
to
close
with
his
foe
and
saw
in
the
doctor
face
now
grown
cool
and
as
usual
the
wily
smile
of
superior
science
and
expected
triumph
in
the
morning
ought
not
to
improve
the
wind
said
tom
to
himself
as
his
left
hand
countered
provokingly
while
his
right
rattled
again
and
again
upon
trebooze
justice
will
overtake
you
in
the
offending
part
which
i
take
to
be
the
epigastric
region
in
a
few
minutes
more
the
scuffle
ended
shamefully
enough
for
the
sottish
squireen
tom
stood
over
him
for
a
minute
as
he
sat
grovelling
and
groaning
among
the
long
grass
i
may
as
well
see
that
i
have
not
killed
him
no
he
will
do
as
well
as
ever
which
is
not
saying
much
now
sir
go
home
quietly
and
ask
trebooze
for
a
little
rhubarb
and
salvolatile
i
call
up
in
the
course
of
to
see
how
you
are
i
kill
you
if
i
catch
you
as
a
man
i
am
open
of
course
to
be
killed
by
any
fair
means
but
as
a
doctor
i
am
still
bound
to
see
after
my
patient
health
and
tom
bowed
civilly
and
walked
back
up
the
path
to
find
grace
after
washing
face
and
hands
in
the
brook
he
found
her
up
at
tolchard
farm
trembling
and
thankful
i
can
not
do
less
than
see
miss
harvey
safe
home
grace
hesitated
tolchard
i
am
sure
will
walk
with
us
it
would
be
safer
in
case
you
felt
faint
again
but
tolchard
would
not
come
to
save
grace
notions
of
propriety
so
tom
passed
grace
arm
through
his
own
she
offered
to
withdraw
it
no
you
will
require
it
you
do
not
know
yet
how
much
you
have
gone
through
my
fear
is
that
you
will
feel
it
all
the
more
painfully
when
the
excitement
is
past
i
shall
send
you
up
a
cordial
and
you
must
promise
me
to
take
it
you
owe
me
a
little
debt
you
know
you
must
pay
it
by
taking
my
medicines
grace
looked
up
at
him
sidelong
for
there
was
a
playful
tenderness
in
his
voice
which
was
new
to
her
and
which
thrilled
her
through
and
through
i
will
indeed
i
promise
you
but
i
am
so
much
better
now
really
i
can
walk
alone
and
she
withdrew
her
arm
from
his
but
not
hastily
after
that
they
walked
on
awhile
in
silence
grace
kept
her
veil
down
for
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
she
loved
that
man
intensely
utterly
she
did
not
seek
to
deny
it
to
herself
god
had
given
him
to
her
and
hers
he
was
the
very
sea
the
devourer
whom
she
hated
who
hungered
to
swallow
up
all
young
fair
life
the
very
sea
had
yielded
him
up
to
her
alive
from
the
dead
and
yet
that
man
she
knew
suspected
her
of
a
base
and
hateful
crime
it
was
too
dreadful
she
could
not
exculpate
herself
save
by
blank
denial
and
what
would
that
avail
the
large
hot
drops
ran
down
her
cheeks
she
had
need
of
all
her
strength
to
prevent
sobbing
she
looked
round
in
the
bright
summer
evening
all
things
were
full
of
joy
and
love
the
were
gay
as
flower
gardens
the
swifts
chased
each
other
screaming
harsh
delight
the
murmured
in
the
wood
beneath
his
song
which
she
had
taught
the
children
a
hundred
times
curuckity
coo
curuck
coo
you
love
me
and
i
love
you
the
woods
slept
golden
in
the
evening
sunlight
and
over
head
brooded
like
one
great
smile
of
god
the
everlasting
blue
he
will
right
me
she
said
thee
still
in
the
lord
and
abide
patiently
and
he
will
make
thy
righteousness
clear
as
the
light
and
thy
just
dealing
as
the
and
after
that
thought
she
wept
no
more
was
it
as
a
reward
for
her
faith
that
tom
began
to
talk
to
her
he
had
paced
on
by
her
side
serious
but
not
sad
true
he
had
suspected
her
he
suspected
her
still
but
that
scene
with
the
dying
child
had
been
no
sham
there
at
least
there
was
nothing
to
suspect
nothing
to
sneer
at
the
calm
purity
hope
which
was
contained
in
it
had
softened
his
spirit
and
woke
up
in
him
feelings
which
were
always
pleasant
feelings
which
the
sight
of
his
father
or
the
writing
to
his
father
could
only
awaken
quaintly
enough
the
thought
of
grace
and
of
his
father
seemed
intertwined
inextricable
if
the
old
man
had
but
such
a
nurse
as
she
and
for
a
moment
he
felt
a
glow
of
tenderness
toward
her
because
he
thought
she
would
be
tender
to
his
father
she
had
stolen
his
money
certainly
or
if
not
she
knew
where
it
was
and
would
not
tell
him
well
what
matter
just
then
he
did
not
want
the
money
at
that
minute
how
much
pleasanter
and
wiser
to
take
things
as
they
came
and
enjoy
himself
while
he
could
and
fancy
that
she
was
always
what
he
had
seen
her
that
day
after
all
it
was
much
more
pleasant
to
trust
people
than
to
suspect
them
handsome
is
who
handsome
does
and
besides
she
did
me
the
kindness
of
saving
my
life
so
it
would
but
be
civil
to
talk
to
her
a
little
he
began
to
talk
to
her
about
the
lovely
scene
around
and
found
to
his
surprise
that
she
saw
as
much
of
it
as
he
and
saw
a
great
deal
more
in
it
than
he
her
answers
were
short
modest
faltering
but
each
one
of
them
suggestive
and
tom
soon
found
that
he
had
met
with
a
mind
which
contained
all
the
elements
of
poetry
and
needed
only
education
to
develop
them
what
a
blue
stocking
she
would
have
been
if
she
had
had
the
misfortune
to
be
born
in
that
station
of
life
but
where
a
clever
man
is
talking
to
a
beautiful
woman
talk
he
will
and
must
for
the
mere
sake
of
showing
off
though
she
be
but
a
village
schoolmistress
and
tom
soon
found
himself
with
a
secret
sneer
at
his
own
vanity
displaying
before
her
all
the
much
finer
things
that
he
had
seen
in
his
travels
and
as
he
talked
she
answered
with
quiet
expressions
of
wonder
sympathy
regret
at
her
own
narrow
sphere
of
experience
till
as
if
the
truth
was
not
enough
he
found
himself
running
to
the
very
edge
of
exaggeration
and
a
little
over
it
in
the
enjoyment
of
calling
out
her
passion
for
the
marvellous
especially
when
called
out
in
honour
of
himself
and
she
simple
creature
drank
it
all
in
as
sparkling
wine
and
only
dreaded
lest
the
stream
should
cease
adventures
with
noble
savages
in
with
greedy
robbers
amid
the
fragrant
hills
of
greece
with
fierce
indians
beneath
the
of
the
far
west
with
coward
mexicans
among
tunals
of
cactus
and
agave
beneath
the
burning
tropic
sun
what
a
man
he
was
where
had
he
not
been
and
what
had
he
not
seen
and
how
he
had
been
preserved
for
her
and
his
image
seemed
to
her
utterly
beautiful
and
glorious
clothed
as
it
was
in
the
beauty
and
glory
of
all
that
he
had
seen
and
done
and
suffered
oh
love
love
love
the
same
in
peasant
and
in
peer
the
more
honour
to
you
then
old
love
to
be
the
same
thing
in
this
world
which
is
common
to
peasant
and
to
peer
they
say
that
you
are
blind
a
dreamer
an
exaggerator
a
liar
in
short
they
know
just
nothing
about
you
then
you
will
not
see
people
as
they
seem
and
as
they
have
become
no
doubt
but
why
because
you
see
them
as
they
ought
to
be
and
are
in
some
deep
way
eternally
in
the
sight
of
him
who
conceived
and
created
them
at
last
she
started
as
if
waking
from
a
pleasant
dream
and
spoke
half
to
herself
oh
how
foolish
of
me
to
be
idling
away
this
opportunity
the
only
one
perhaps
which
i
may
have
oh
thurnall
tell
me
about
this
cholera
what
about
it
everything
ever
since
i
heard
of
what
you
have
been
saying
to
the
people
ever
since
headley
sermon
it
has
been
like
fire
in
my
ears
i
am
truly
glad
to
hear
it
if
all
parsons
had
preached
about
it
for
the
last
fifteen
years
as
headley
did
last
sunday
if
they
had
told
people
plainly
that
if
the
cholera
was
god
judgment
at
all
it
was
his
judgment
of
the
sin
of
dirt
and
that
the
repentance
which
he
required
was
to
wash
and
be
clean
in
literal
earnest
the
cholera
would
be
impossible
in
england
by
now
oh
thurnall
but
is
it
not
god
doing
and
can
we
stop
his
hand
i
know
nothing
about
that
miss
harvey
i
only
know
that
wheresoever
cholera
breaks
out
it
is
some
one
fault
and
if
deaths
occur
some
one
ought
to
be
tried
for
manslaughter
i
had
almost
said
murder
and
transported
for
life
someone
who
that
will
be
settled
in
the
next
generation
when
men
have
common
sense
enough
to
make
laws
for
the
preservation
of
their
own
lives
against
the
dirt
and
covetousness
and
idleness
of
a
set
of
human
hogs
grace
was
silent
for
awhile
but
can
nothing
be
done
to
keep
it
off
now
must
it
come
i
believe
it
must
still
one
may
do
enough
to
save
many
lives
in
the
meanwhile
enough
to
save
many
lives
lives
immortal
souls
too
oh
what
could
i
do
a
great
deal
miss
harvey
said
tom
across
whom
the
recollection
of
grace
influence
flashed
for
the
first
time
what
a
help
she
might
be
to
him
and
he
talked
on
and
on
to
her
and
found
that
she
entered
into
his
plans
with
all
her
wild
enthusiasm
but
also
with
sound
practical
common
sense
and
tom
began
to
respect
her
intellect
as
well
as
her
heart
at
last
however
she
faltered
oh
if
i
could
but
believe
all
this
is
it
not
fighting
against
god
i
do
not
know
what
sort
of
god
yours
is
miss
harvey
i
believe
in
some
one
who
made
all
that
and
he
pointed
round
him
to
the
glorious
woods
and
glorious
sky
i
should
have
fancied
from
your
speech
to
that
poor
girl
that
you
believed
in
him
also
you
may
however
only
believe
in
the
same
being
in
whom
the
methodist
parson
believes
one
who
intends
to
hurl
into
endless
agony
every
human
being
who
has
not
had
a
chance
of
hearing
the
said
preacher
nostrum
for
delivering
men
out
of
the
hands
of
him
who
made
them
what
do
you
mean
asked
grace
startled
alike
by
tom
words
and
the
intense
scorn
and
bitterness
of
his
tone
that
matters
little
what
do
you
mean
in
turn
what
did
you
mean
by
saying
that
saving
lives
is
saving
immortal
souls
oh
is
it
not
giving
them
time
to
repent
what
will
become
of
them
if
they
are
cut
off
in
the
midst
of
their
sins
if
you
had
a
son
whom
it
was
not
convenient
to
you
to
keep
at
home
would
his
being
a
bad
fellow
the
greatest
scoundrel
on
the
earth
be
a
reason
for
your
turning
him
into
the
streets
to
live
by
thieving
and
end
by
going
to
the
dogs
for
ever
and
a
day
no
but
what
do
you
mean
that
i
do
not
think
that
god
when
he
sends
a
human
being
out
of
this
world
is
more
cruel
than
you
or
i
would
be
if
we
transport
a
man
because
he
is
too
bad
to
be
in
england
and
he
shows
any
signs
of
mending
we
give
him
a
fresh
chance
in
the
colonies
and
let
him
start
again
to
try
if
he
can
not
do
better
next
time
and
do
you
fancy
that
god
when
he
transports
a
man
out
of
this
world
never
gives
him
a
fresh
chance
in
another
especially
when
nine
out
of
ten
poor
rascals
have
never
had
a
fair
chance
yet
grace
looked
up
in
his
face
astonished
oh
if
i
could
but
believe
that
oh
it
would
give
me
some
gleam
of
hope
for
my
two
but
no
it
not
in
scripture
where
the
tree
falls
there
it
lies
and
as
the
fool
dies
so
dies
the
wise
man
and
there
is
one
account
to
the
righteous
and
to
the
wicked
and
a
man
has
no
over
a
beast
for
both
turn
alike
to
dust
and
solomon
does
not
know
he
says
or
any
one
else
anything
about
the
whole
matter
or
even
whether
there
be
any
life
after
death
at
all
and
so
he
says
the
only
wise
thing
is
to
leave
such
deep
questions
alone
for
him
who
made
us
to
settle
in
his
own
way
and
just
to
fear
god
and
keep
his
commandments
and
do
the
work
which
lies
nearest
us
with
all
our
might
grace
was
silent
you
are
surprised
to
hear
me
quote
scripture
and
well
you
may
be
but
that
same
book
of
ecclesiastes
is
a
very
old
favourite
with
me
for
i
am
no
christian
but
a
worlding
if
ever
there
was
one
but
it
does
puzzle
me
why
you
who
are
a
christian
should
talk
one
as
you
have
been
talking
to
that
poor
girl
and
the
next
go
for
information
about
the
next
life
to
poor
old
disappointed
solomon
with
his
three
hundred
and
odd
idolatrous
wives
who
confesses
fairly
that
this
life
is
a
failure
and
that
he
does
not
know
whether
there
is
any
next
life
at
all
whether
tom
was
altogether
right
or
not
is
not
the
question
here
the
novelist
business
is
to
represent
the
real
thoughts
of
mankind
when
they
are
not
absolutely
unfit
to
be
told
and
certainly
tom
spoke
the
doubts
of
thousands
when
he
spoke
his
own
grace
was
silent
still
well
he
said
beyond
that
i
ca
go
being
no
theologian
but
when
a
preacher
tells
people
in
one
breath
of
a
god
who
so
loves
men
that
he
gave
his
own
son
to
save
them
and
in
the
next
that
the
same
god
so
hates
men
that
he
will
cast
of
them
into
hopeless
torture
for
ever
and
if
that
is
not
hating
i
do
know
what
is
unless
he
the
preacher
gets
a
chance
of
talking
to
them
for
a
few
minutes
why
i
should
like
miss
harvey
to
put
that
gentleman
upon
a
real
fire
for
ten
minutes
instead
of
his
comfortable
dinner
which
stands
ready
frying
for
him
and
which
he
was
going
home
to
eat
as
jolly
as
if
all
the
world
was
not
going
to
destruction
and
there
let
him
feel
what
fire
was
like
and
reconsider
his
statements
grace
looked
up
at
him
no
more
but
walked
on
in
silence
pondering
many
things
howsoever
that
may
be
sir
tell
me
what
to
do
in
this
cholera
and
i
will
do
it
if
i
kill
myself
with
work
or
infection
you
sha
do
that
we
can
not
spare
you
from
aberalva
grace
said
tom
you
must
save
a
few
more
poor
creatures
ere
you
die
out
of
the
hands
of
that
good
being
who
made
little
children
and
love
and
happiness
and
the
flowers
and
the
sunshine
and
the
fruitful
earth
and
who
you
say
redeemed
them
all
again
when
they
were
lost
by
an
act
of
love
which
passes
all
human
dreams
do
not
talk
so
cried
grace
it
frightens
me
it
puzzles
me
and
makes
me
miserable
oh
if
you
would
but
become
a
christian
and
listen
to
the
gospel
yes
oh
yes
a
gospel
means
good
news
i
thought
when
you
have
any
to
tell
me
i
will
listen
meanwhile
the
news
that
three
out
of
four
of
those
poor
fellows
down
town
are
going
to
a
certain
place
seems
to
me
such
terribly
bad
news
that
i
ca
help
fancying
that
it
is
not
the
gospel
at
all
and
so
get
on
the
best
way
i
can
listening
to
the
good
news
about
god
which
this
grand
old
world
and
my
microscope
and
my
books
tell
me
no
grace
i
have
more
good
news
than
that
and
confess
it
to
you
he
paused
and
his
voice
softened
say
what
the
preacher
may
he
must
be
a
good
god
who
makes
such
creatures
as
you
and
sends
them
into
the
world
to
comfort
poor
wretches
follow
your
own
sweet
heart
grace
and
torment
yourself
no
more
with
these
dark
dreams
my
heart
cried
she
looking
down
it
is
deceitful
and
desperately
wicked
i
wish
mine
were
too
then
said
tom
but
it
can
not
be
as
long
as
it
is
so
unlike
yours
now
stop
grace
i
want
to
speak
to
you
there
was
a
gate
in
front
of
them
leading
into
the
road
as
they
came
to
it
tom
lingered
with
his
hand
upon
the
top
bar
that
grace
might
stop
she
did
stop
why
did
he
call
her
grace
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
on
one
matter
on
which
i
believe
i
ought
to
have
spoken
long
ago
she
looked
up
at
him
surprise
in
her
large
eyes
and
turned
pale
as
he
went
on
i
ought
long
ago
to
have
begged
your
pardon
for
something
rude
which
i
said
to
you
at
your
own
door
this
day
has
made
me
quite
ashamed
of
but
she
interrupted
him
quite
wildly
gasping
for
breath
the
belt
the
belt
oh
my
god
my
god
have
you
heard
anything
more
anything
more
not
a
word
but
to
his
astonishment
she
heaved
a
deep
sigh
as
if
relieved
from
a
sudden
fear
his
face
clouded
and
his
eyebrows
rose
was
she
guilty
then
after
all
with
the
quick
eyes
of
love
she
saw
the
change
and
broke
out
passionately
yes
suspect
me
suspect
me
if
you
will
only
give
me
time
send
me
to
prison
innocent
as
i
am
innocent
as
that
child
there
above
would
god
i
were
dying
like
her
only
give
me
time
o
misery
i
had
hoped
you
had
forgotten
that
it
was
lost
in
the
sea
that
what
am
i
saying
only
give
me
time
and
she
dropped
on
her
knees
before
him
wringing
her
hands
miss
harvey
this
is
not
worthy
of
you
if
you
be
innocent
as
i
do
doubt
what
more
do
you
need
or
i
he
took
her
hands
and
lifted
her
up
but
she
still
kept
looking
down
round
upwards
like
a
hunted
deer
and
pleading
in
words
which
seemed
sobbed
out
as
by
some
poor
soul
on
the
rack
between
choking
spasms
of
agony
oh
i
do
know
god
help
me
o
lord
help
me
i
will
try
and
find
it
i
know
i
shall
find
it
only
have
patience
have
patience
with
me
a
little
and
i
know
i
shall
bring
it
you
and
then
and
then
you
will
forgive
forgive
and
she
laid
her
hands
upon
his
arms
and
looked
up
in
his
face
with
a
piteous
smile
of
entreaty
she
had
never
looked
so
beautiful
as
at
that
moment
the
devil
saw
it
and
entered
into
the
heart
of
thomas
thurnall
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
kissed
away
her
tears
stopped
her
mouth
with
kisses
yes
wait
wait
for
ever
if
you
will
i
lose
another
belt
for
such
another
look
as
that
she
was
bewildered
for
a
moment
poor
fond
wretch
at
finding
herself
where
she
would
gladly
have
stayed
for
ever
but
quickly
she
recovered
her
reason
let
me
go
she
cried
struggling
this
is
not
right
let
me
go
sir
and
she
tried
to
cover
her
burning
cheeks
with
her
hands
i
will
not
grace
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
tell
you
you
do
not
sir
and
she
struggled
still
more
fiercely
do
not
deceive
yourself
me
you
can
not
deceive
let
me
go
i
say
you
could
not
demean
yourself
to
love
a
poor
girl
like
me
utterly
losing
his
head
tom
ran
on
with
passionate
words
no
sir
you
know
that
i
am
not
fit
to
be
your
wife
and
do
you
fancy
that
i
maddened
now
tom
went
on
ere
he
was
aware
from
a
foolish
deed
to
a
base
speech
i
know
nothing
but
that
i
shall
keep
you
in
pawn
for
my
belt
till
that
is
at
least
restored
you
are
in
my
power
grace
remember
that
she
thrust
him
away
with
so
sudden
and
desperate
a
spasm
that
he
was
forced
to
let
her
go
she
stood
gazing
at
him
a
trembling
deer
no
longer
but
rather
a
lioness
at
bay
her
face
flashing
beautiful
indignation
in
your
power
yes
sir
my
character
my
life
for
aught
i
know
but
not
my
soul
send
me
to
bodmin
gaol
if
you
will
but
offer
no
more
insults
to
a
modest
maiden
oh
and
her
expression
changed
to
one
of
lofty
sorrow
and
pity
oh
to
find
all
men
alike
at
heart
after
having
fancied
you
fancied
you
what
she
had
fancied
him
her
modesty
dare
not
repeat
to
find
you
even
such
another
as
mr
trebooze
tom
was
checked
as
for
mere
indignation
in
such
cases
he
had
seen
enough
of
that
to
trust
it
no
more
than
ice
that
is
one
night
old
but
pity
for
him
was
a
weapon
of
defence
to
which
he
was
unaccustomed
and
there
was
no
contempt
in
her
pity
and
no
affectation
either
her
voice
was
solemn
but
tender
gently
upbraiding
like
her
countenance
never
had
he
felt
grace
mysterious
attraction
so
strong
upon
him
and
for
the
first
and
last
time
perhaps
for
many
a
year
he
answered
with
downcast
eyes
of
shame
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
harvey
i
have
been
rude
mad
if
you
will
look
in
your
glass
when
you
go
home
and
have
a
woman
heart
in
you
you
may
at
least
see
an
excuse
for
me
but
like
trebooze
i
am
not
forgive
and
forget
and
let
us
walk
home
rationally
and
he
offered
to
take
her
hand
no
not
now
not
till
i
can
trust
you
sir
said
she
the
words
were
lofty
enough
but
there
was
a
profound
melancholy
in
their
tone
which
humbled
tom
still
more
was
it
possible
she
seemed
to
have
hinted
it
that
she
had
thought
him
a
very
grand
personage
till
now
and
that
he
had
disgraced
himself
in
her
eyes
if
a
man
had
suspected
tom
of
such
a
feeling
i
fear
he
would
have
cared
little
save
how
to
restore
the
balance
by
making
a
fool
of
the
man
who
fancied
him
a
fool
but
no
male
or
pride
is
proof
against
the
contempt
of
woman
and
tom
slunk
along
by
the
schoolmistress
side
as
if
he
had
been
one
of
her
naughtiest
he
tried
of
course
to
brazen
it
out
to
his
own
conscience
he
had
done
no
harm
after
all
indeed
never
seriously
meant
any
she
was
making
a
ridiculous
fuss
about
nothing
it
was
all
part
and
parcel
of
her
methodistical
cant
he
dared
say
that
she
was
not
as
prudish
with
the
methodist
parson
and
at
that
base
thought
he
paused
for
a
flush
of
rage
and
a
strong
desire
on
such
hypothesis
to
slay
the
said
methodist
parson
or
any
one
else
who
dared
even
to
look
sweet
on
grace
showed
him
plainly
enough
what
he
had
long
been
afraid
of
that
he
was
really
in
love
with
her
and
that
as
he
put
it
if
she
did
not
make
a
fool
of
herself
about
him
he
was
but
too
likely
to
end
in
making
a
fool
of
himself
about
her
however
he
must
speak
to
support
his
own
character
as
a
man
of
the
world
it
would
never
do
to
knock
under
to
a
country
girl
in
this
way
she
might
go
and
boast
of
it
all
over
the
town
beside
foiled
or
not
he
would
not
give
in
without
trying
her
mettle
somewhat
further
miss
harvey
will
you
forgive
me
i
have
forgiven
you
will
you
forget
if
i
can
she
said
with
a
marked
expression
which
signified
though
of
course
she
did
not
mean
tom
to
understand
it
some
of
what
is
past
is
too
precious
and
some
too
painful
to
forget
i
do
not
ask
you
to
forget
all
which
has
passed
i
am
afraid
that
there
is
nothing
which
would
be
any
credit
to
you
sir
to
have
remembered
credit
or
none
said
tom
unabashed
do
not
forget
one
word
that
i
said
she
looked
hastily
and
sidelong
round
that
i
am
in
your
power
no
curse
it
i
wish
i
had
bitten
out
my
tongue
before
i
had
said
that
no
that
i
am
in
your
power
miss
harvey
sir
i
never
heard
you
say
that
and
if
you
had
the
sooner
anything
so
untrue
is
forgotten
the
better
i
said
that
i
loved
you
grace
and
if
that
does
not
mean
that
sir
thurnall
i
can
not
i
will
not
hear
you
only
insult
me
sir
by
speaking
thus
when
you
know
that
that
you
consider
me
a
thief
and
the
poor
girl
burst
into
tears
again
i
do
not
i
do
not
cried
tom
growing
really
earnest
at
the
sight
of
her
sorrow
did
i
not
begin
this
unhappy
talk
by
begging
your
pardon
for
ever
having
let
such
a
thought
cross
my
mind
but
you
do
you
do
you
told
me
as
much
at
my
own
door
and
i
have
seen
it
ever
since
till
i
have
almost
gone
mad
under
it
i
will
swear
to
you
by
all
that
is
sacred
that
i
do
not
oh
grace
the
first
moment
i
saw
you
my
heart
told
me
that
it
was
impossible
and
now
this
afternoon
as
i
listened
to
you
with
that
sick
girl
i
felt
a
wretch
for
ever
having
grace
i
tell
you
you
made
me
feel
for
the
moment
a
better
man
than
i
ever
felt
in
my
life
before
a
poor
return
i
have
made
for
that
truly
grace
looked
up
in
his
face
gasping
oh
say
that
say
that
again
oh
good
lord
merciful
lord
at
last
oh
if
you
knew
what
it
was
to
have
even
one
weight
lifted
off
among
all
my
heavy
burdens
and
that
weight
the
hardest
to
bear
god
forgive
me
that
it
should
have
been
so
oh
i
can
breathe
freely
now
again
that
i
know
i
am
not
suspected
by
you
by
you
tom
could
not
but
see
what
after
all
no
human
being
can
conceal
that
grace
cared
for
him
and
the
devil
came
and
tempted
him
once
more
but
this
time
it
was
in
vain
tom
better
angel
had
returned
grace
tender
guilelessness
which
would
with
too
many
men
only
have
marked
her
out
as
the
easier
prey
was
to
him
as
a
sacred
shield
before
her
innocence
so
noble
so
enthusiastic
so
pure
he
could
not
play
the
villain
with
that
woman
but
there
was
plainly
a
mystery
what
were
the
burdens
heavier
even
than
unjust
suspicion
of
which
she
had
spoken
there
was
no
harm
in
asking
but
grace
miss
harvey
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
if
i
ask
why
speak
so
often
as
if
finding
this
money
depended
on
you
alone
you
wish
me
to
recover
it
i
know
and
if
you
can
counsel
me
why
not
do
so
why
not
tell
me
whom
you
suspect
her
old
wild
terror
returned
in
an
instant
she
stopped
short
suspect
i
suspect
oh
i
have
suspected
too
many
already
suspected
till
i
began
to
hate
my
hate
life
itself
when
i
fancied
that
i
saw
written
on
every
forehead
oh
do
not
ask
me
to
suspect
any
more
tom
was
silent
oh
she
cried
after
a
moment
pause
oh
that
we
were
back
in
those
old
times
i
have
read
of
when
they
used
to
put
people
to
the
torture
to
make
them
confess
why
in
heaven
name
because
then
i
should
have
been
tortured
and
have
confessed
it
true
or
false
in
the
agony
and
have
been
hanged
they
used
to
hang
them
then
and
put
them
out
of
their
misery
and
i
should
have
been
put
out
of
mine
and
no
one
have
been
blamed
but
me
for
ever
more
you
forget
said
tom
lost
in
wonder
that
then
i
should
have
blamed
you
as
well
as
every
one
else
true
yes
it
was
a
foolish
faithless
word
i
did
not
take
it
and
it
would
have
been
no
good
to
my
soul
to
say
i
did
lies
can
not
prosper
can
not
prosper
mr
thurnall
and
she
stopped
short
again
what
my
dear
grace
said
he
kindly
enough
for
he
began
to
fear
that
she
was
losing
her
wits
i
saved
your
life
you
did
grace
then
i
never
thought
to
ask
for
payment
but
oh
i
must
now
will
you
promise
me
one
thing
in
return
what
you
will
as
i
am
a
man
and
a
gentleman
i
can
trust
you
to
ask
nothing
which
is
not
worthy
of
you
tom
spoke
truth
he
felt
perhaps
love
made
him
feel
it
all
the
more
easily
that
whatever
was
behind
he
was
safe
in
that
woman
hands
then
promise
me
that
you
will
wait
one
month
only
one
month
ask
no
questions
mention
nothing
to
any
living
soul
and
if
before
that
time
i
do
not
bring
you
that
belt
back
send
me
to
bodmin
gaol
and
let
me
bear
my
punishment
i
promise
said
tom
and
the
two
walked
on
again
in
silence
till
they
neared
the
head
of
the
village
then
grace
went
forward
like
nausicaa
when
she
left
ulysses
lest
the
townsfolk
should
talk
and
tom
sat
down
upon
a
bank
and
watched
her
figure
vanishing
in
the
dusk
much
he
puzzled
hunting
up
and
down
in
his
cunning
head
for
an
explanation
of
the
mystery
at
last
he
found
one
which
seemed
to
fit
the
facts
so
well
that
he
rose
with
a
whistle
of
satisfaction
and
walked
homewards
evidently
her
mother
had
stolen
the
belt
and
grace
was
if
not
a
repentant
accomplice
for
that
he
could
not
believe
at
least
aware
of
the
fact
well
it
is
a
hard
knot
for
her
to
untie
poor
child
and
on
the
strength
of
having
saved
my
life
she
shall
untie
it
her
own
way
i
can
wait
i
hope
the
money
wo
be
spent
meanwhile
though
and
the
empty
leather
returned
to
me
when
wanted
no
longer
however
done
already
if
done
at
all
i
was
a
fool
for
not
acting
at
once
a
double
fool
for
suspecting
her
ass
that
i
was
to
take
up
with
a
false
scent
and
throw
myself
off
the
true
one
my
everlasting
unbelief
in
people
has
punished
itself
this
time
i
might
have
got
a
three
months
ago
and
had
that
old
witch
safe
in
the
bilboes
but
no
i
might
not
have
found
it
after
all
and
there
would
have
been
only
an
esclandre
and
if
i
know
that
girl
heart
she
would
have
been
ten
times
more
miserable
for
her
mother
than
for
herself
so
it
as
well
as
it
is
besides
it
really
good
fun
to
watch
how
such
a
pretty
plot
will
work
itself
out
as
good
as
a
pack
of
harriers
with
a
cold
scent
and
a
squatted
hare
so
live
and
let
live
only
thomas
thurnall
if
you
go
for
to
come
for
to
go
for
to
make
such
an
abominable
ass
of
yourself
with
that
young
lady
any
more
like
a
miserable
you
will
be
pleased
to
make
tracks
and
vanish
out
of
these
parts
for
ever
for
my
purse
ca
afford
to
have
you
marrying
a
schoolmistress
in
your
impoverished
old
age
and
my
character
which
also
is
my
purse
ca
afford
worse
one
word
of
grace
had
fixed
itself
in
tom
memory
what
did
she
mean
by
her
two
he
contrived
to
ask
willis
that
very
evening
oh
do
you
know
sir
she
had
a
young
brother
drowned
a
long
while
ago
when
she
was
sixteen
or
so
he
went
out
fishing
on
the
sabbath
with
another
like
him
and
both
were
swamped
wild
young
lads
both
as
lads
will
be
but
she
sweet
maid
took
it
so
to
heart
that
she
never
held
up
her
head
since
nor
will
i
think
at
times
to
her
dying
day
humph
was
she
fond
of
the
other
lad
then
sir
said
willis
i
do
think
it
fair
like
not
decent
if
you
excuse
an
old
sailor
to
talk
about
young
maids
affairs
that
they
would
talk
of
themselves
perhaps
not
even
to
themselves
so
i
never
asked
any
questions
myself
and
think
it
rude
in
me
to
ask
any
well
i
believe
you
right
good
old
gentleman
that
you
are
what
a
nobleman
you
have
made
if
you
had
had
the
luck
to
have
been
born
in
that
station
of
life
i
have
found
too
much
trouble
in
doing
my
duty
in
my
humble
place
to
wish
to
be
in
any
higher
one
so
thought
tom
to
himself
a
girl
fancy
but
it
explains
so
much
in
the
character
especially
when
the
temperament
is
melancholic
however
to
quote
solomon
once
more
live
dog
is
better
than
a
dead
lion
and
i
have
not
much
to
fear
from
a
rival
who
has
been
washed
out
of
this
world
ten
years
since
heyday
rival
quotha
tom
thurnall
you
are
going
to
make
a
fool
of
yourself
you
must
go
sir
i
warn
you
you
must
flee
till
you
have
recovered
your
senses
there
appeared
next
morning
in
tom
shop
a
new
phenomenon
a
smart
youth
dressed
in
what
he
considered
to
be
the
newest
london
fashion
but
which
was
really
that
translation
of
last
year
fashion
which
happened
to
be
current
in
the
windows
of
the
bodmin
tailors
tom
knew
him
by
sight
and
name
one
creed
a
squireen
like
trebooze
and
an
especial
friend
of
trebooze
under
whose
tutelage
he
had
learned
to
smoke
cavendish
assiduously
from
the
age
of
fifteen
thereby
improving
neither
his
stature
nor
his
digestion
his
nerves
nor
the
intelligence
of
his
countenance
he
entered
with
a
lofty
air
and
paused
awhile
as
he
spoke
is
it
possible
said
tom
to
himself
that
trebooze
has
sent
me
a
challenge
it
would
be
too
good
fun
i
wait
and
see
so
he
went
on
rolling
pills
i
say
sir
quoth
the
youth
who
had
determined
as
an
owner
of
land
to
treat
the
doctor
duly
haut
en
and
had
a
vague
notion
that
a
liberal
use
of
the
word
sir
would
both
help
thereto
and
be
consonant
with
professional
style
of
duel
diplomacy
whereof
he
had
read
in
novels
tom
turned
slowly
and
then
took
a
long
look
at
him
over
the
counter
through
halfshut
with
chin
upraised
as
if
he
had
been
suddenly
afflicted
with
short
sight
and
worked
on
meanwhile
steadily
at
his
pills
that
is
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
sir
ahem
went
on
creed
being
gradually
but
surely
discomfited
by
tom
steady
gaze
do
trouble
yourself
sir
i
see
your
case
in
your
face
a
slight
nervous
affection
will
pass
as
the
digestion
improves
i
will
make
you
up
a
set
of
pills
for
the
night
but
i
should
advise
a
little
ammonia
and
valerian
at
once
may
i
mix
it
sir
you
mistake
me
sir
not
in
the
least
you
have
brought
me
a
challenge
from
mr
trebooze
i
have
sir
said
the
youth
with
a
grand
air
at
once
relieved
by
having
the
awful
words
said
for
him
and
exalted
by
the
dignity
of
his
first
and
perhaps
last
employment
in
that
line
well
sir
said
tom
deliberately
trebooze
does
me
a
kindness
for
which
i
can
not
sufficiently
thank
him
and
you
also
as
his
second
it
is
full
six
months
since
i
fought
and
i
was
getting
hardly
to
know
myself
again
you
will
have
to
fight
now
sir
said
the
youth
trying
to
brazen
off
by
his
discourtesy
increasing
suspicion
that
he
had
caught
a
tartar
of
course
of
course
and
of
course
too
i
fight
you
afterwards
i
i
sir
i
am
trebooze
friend
his
second
sir
you
do
not
seem
to
understand
sir
pardon
me
young
gentleman
said
tom
in
a
very
quiet
determined
voice
it
is
i
who
have
a
right
to
tell
you
that
you
do
not
understand
in
such
matters
as
these
i
had
fought
my
man
and
more
than
one
of
them
while
you
were
eating
blackberries
in
a
short
jacket
what
do
you
mean
sir
quoth
the
youth
in
fury
and
began
swearing
a
little
simple
fact
are
you
not
about
years
old
what
is
that
to
you
sir
no
business
of
mine
of
course
you
may
be
growing
into
your
second
childhood
for
aught
i
care
but
if
as
i
guess
you
are
about
i
as
i
know
am
then
i
fought
my
first
duel
when
you
were
five
years
old
and
my
tenth
i
should
say
when
you
were
fifteen
at
which
time
i
suppose
you
were
not
ashamed
either
of
the
jacket
or
the
blackberries
you
will
find
me
a
man
now
sir
at
all
events
said
creed
justly
wroth
at
what
was
after
all
a
sophism
for
if
a
man
is
not
a
man
at
twenty
he
never
will
be
one
you
know
i
suppose
that
as
the
challenged
i
have
the
choice
of
weapons
of
course
sir
said
creed
in
an
generous
tone
because
he
did
not
very
clearly
know
then
sir
i
always
fight
across
a
handkerchief
you
will
tell
trebooze
so
he
is
i
really
believe
a
brave
man
and
will
accept
the
terms
you
will
tell
yourself
the
same
whether
you
be
a
brave
man
or
not
the
youth
lost
the
last
words
in
those
which
went
before
them
he
was
no
coward
would
have
stood
up
to
be
shot
at
at
fifteen
paces
like
any
one
else
but
the
deliberate
butchery
of
fighting
across
a
handkerchief
do
i
understand
you
sir
that
depends
on
whether
you
are
clever
enough
or
not
to
comprehend
your
native
tongue
across
a
handkerchief
i
say
do
you
hear
that
and
tom
rolled
on
at
his
pills
i
do
and
when
i
have
fought
him
i
fight
you
and
the
pills
rolled
steadily
at
the
same
pace
but
sir
why
sir
because
said
tom
looking
him
full
in
the
face
because
you
calling
yourself
a
gentleman
and
being
more
shame
for
you
one
by
birth
dare
to
come
here
for
a
foolish
vulgar
superstition
called
honour
to
ask
me
a
quiet
medical
man
to
go
and
be
shot
at
by
a
man
whom
you
know
to
be
a
drunken
profligate
blackguard
simply
because
as
you
know
as
well
as
i
i
interfered
to
prevent
his
insulting
a
poor
helpless
girl
and
in
so
doing
was
forced
to
give
him
what
you
if
you
are
as
i
believe
a
gentleman
would
have
given
him
also
in
my
place
i
do
understand
you
sir
said
the
lad
blushing
all
the
while
as
one
honestly
for
tom
had
spoken
the
exact
truth
and
he
knew
it
do
lie
sir
and
tell
me
that
you
do
understand
you
understand
every
word
which
i
have
spoken
and
you
know
that
it
is
true
lie
yes
lie
look
you
sir
i
have
no
wish
to
fight
you
will
fight
though
whether
you
wish
it
or
not
said
the
youth
with
a
hysterical
laugh
meant
to
be
defiant
but
i
can
snuff
a
candle
i
can
split
a
bullet
on
a
penknife
at
fifteen
paces
do
you
mean
to
frighten
us
by
boasting
we
shall
see
what
you
can
do
when
you
come
on
the
ground
across
a
handkerchief
but
on
no
other
condition
and
unless
you
will
accept
that
condition
i
will
assuredly
the
next
time
i
see
you
be
we
where
we
may
treat
you
as
i
treated
your
friend
trebooze
i
do
it
now
get
out
of
my
shop
sir
what
do
you
want
here
interfering
with
my
honest
business
and
to
the
astonishment
of
trebooze
second
tom
vaulted
clean
over
the
counter
and
rushed
at
him
sacred
be
the
honour
of
the
gallant
west
country
but
both
being
friends
as
aristotle
has
it
it
is
a
sacred
duty
to
speak
the
truth
creed
vanished
through
the
open
door
i
rid
myself
of
the
fellow
jollily
said
tom
to
frank
that
day
after
telling
him
the
whole
story
and
no
credit
to
me
i
saw
from
the
minute
he
came
in
there
was
no
fight
in
him
but
suppose
he
had
accepted
or
suppose
trebooze
accepts
still
there
was
my
game
to
frighten
him
he
take
care
trebooze
fight
for
he
knows
that
he
must
fight
next
he
go
home
and
patch
the
matter
up
trust
him
meanwhile
the
oaf
had
not
even
enough
to
ask
for
my
second
lucky
for
me
for
i
do
know
where
to
have
found
one
save
the
lieutenant
and
though
he
would
have
gone
out
safe
enough
it
would
have
been
a
bore
for
the
good
old
fellow
and
said
prank
utterly
taken
aback
by
tom
levity
you
would
actually
have
stood
to
shoot
and
be
shot
at
across
a
handkerchief
tom
stuck
out
his
great
chin
and
looked
at
him
with
one
of
his
quaint
sidelong
moues
you
are
my
very
good
friend
sir
but
not
my
i
know
that
but
really
as
a
mere
question
of
human
curiosity
oh
if
you
ask
me
on
the
human
ground
and
not
on
the
sacerdotal
i
tell
you
i
tried
it
twice
and
i
should
be
sorry
to
try
it
again
though
it
a
very
easy
dodge
keep
your
right
elbow
up
up
to
your
ear
and
the
moment
you
hear
the
word
fire
a
high
elbow
and
a
cool
heart
that
all
and
that
wins
wins
good
heavens
as
you
are
here
alive
you
must
have
killed
your
man
no
i
only
shot
my
men
each
through
the
body
and
each
of
them
deserved
it
but
it
is
an
ugly
chance
i
should
have
been
sorry
to
try
it
on
that
yokel
the
boy
may
make
a
man
yet
and
what
more
said
tom
bursting
into
a
great
laugh
he
will
make
a
man
and
go
down
to
his
fathers
in
peace
à
and
so
will
that
wretched
trebooze
for
i
bet
you
my
head
to
a
china
orange
i
hear
no
more
of
this
matter
and
do
even
lose
trebooze
custom
upon
my
word
i
envy
your
sanguine
temperament
headley
i
shall
quietly
make
my
call
at
trebooze
as
if
nothing
had
happened
what
will
you
bet
me
that
i
am
not
received
as
usual
i
never
bet
said
frank
then
you
do
well
it
is
a
foolish
and
a
dirty
trick
playing
with
edge
tools
and
cutting
one
own
fingers
nevertheless
i
speak
truth
as
you
will
see
you
are
a
most
extraordinary
man
all
this
is
so
contrary
to
your
usual
caution
when
you
are
driven
against
the
ropes
out
is
the
old
rule
of
fistiana
and
common
sense
it
is
an
extreme
bore
all
the
more
reason
for
showing
such
an
ugly
front
as
to
give
people
no
chance
of
its
happening
again
nothing
so
dangerous
as
headley
the
devil
and
he
will
flee
from
you
your
creed
says
mine
only
translates
it
into
practice
i
have
no
liking
for
myself
did
you
ever
said
tom
hear
the
story
of
the
two
sandhurst
broomsquires
so
we
call
in
berkshire
squatters
on
the
moor
who
live
by
tying
heath
into
brooms
two
of
them
met
in
reading
market
once
and
fell
out
ever
do
you
manage
to
sell
your
brooms
for
three
halfpence
i
steals
the
heth
and
i
steals
the
binds
and
i
steals
the
handles
and
yet
i
ca
afoord
to
sell
under
twopence
ah
but
you
see
says
the
other
steals
mine
ready
made
moral
if
you
going
to
do
a
thing
do
it
outright
that
very
evening
tom
came
in
again
well
i
been
to
trebooze
and
fared
how
just
as
i
warned
you
inquired
into
his
symptoms
prescribed
for
his
digestion
if
he
goes
on
as
he
is
doing
he
will
soon
have
none
left
to
prescribe
for
and
finally
plastered
with
a
sublime
generosity
the
nose
which
my
own
knuckles
had
contused
impossible
you
are
the
most
miraculously
impudent
of
men
pish
simple
common
sense
i
knew
that
trebooze
would
suspect
that
the
world
had
heard
of
his
mishap
and
took
care
to
let
her
know
that
i
knew
by
coming
up
to
inquire
for
him
bono
power
to
have
them
or
any
one
a
little
more
in
my
power
next
i
knew
that
he
dared
not
fly
out
at
me
for
fear
i
should
tell
trebooze
what
he
had
been
after
you
see
ah
it
was
delicious
to
have
the
great
oaf
sitting
sulking
under
my
fingers
longing
to
knock
my
head
off
and
i
plastering
away
with
words
of
deepest
astonishment
and
condolence
i
verily
believe
that
before
we
parted
i
had
persuaded
him
that
his
black
eye
proceeded
entirely
from
his
having
run
up
against
a
tree
in
the
dark
well
said
frank
half
sadly
though
enjoying
the
joke
in
spite
of
himself
i
can
not
help
thinking
it
would
have
been
a
fit
moment
for
giving
the
poor
wretch
a
more
solemn
lesson
my
dear
sir
a
good
licking
and
he
had
one
and
something
over
is
the
best
lesson
for
that
manner
of
biped
that
the
way
to
school
him
but
as
we
are
on
lessons
i
give
you
a
hint
go
on
model
of
said
frank
scoff
at
me
if
you
will
i
am
proof
but
hearken
you
must
turn
out
that
schoolmistress
she
an
angel
and
i
know
it
and
if
i
say
so
of
any
human
being
you
may
be
sure
i
have
pretty
good
reasons
i
am
beginning
to
be
of
your
mind
myself
