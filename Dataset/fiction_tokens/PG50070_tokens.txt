conclusion
dave

chapter
i
the
giant
airship
that
your
airship
exactly
but
i
am
in
charge
of
it
to
the
interstate
aero
company
pretty
well
posted
i
to
be
close
to
the
interstate
people
so
like
to
look
the
machine
over
in
fact
if
got
an
expert
aviator
on
hand
i
think
take
a
little
john
grimshaw
and
aeronaut
regarded
the
foppishly
dressed
young
man
before
him
quizzically
you
do
eh
he
observed
very
dryly
it
be
on
this
occasion
as
to
an
expert
aviator
got
dave
heard
of
everybody
has
i
reckon
here
on
business
though
and
that
sign
is
for
outsiders
yourself
old
grimshaw
pointed
to
a
sign
on
the
big
gates
of
the
high
board
enclosure
outside
of
which
he
stood
on
guard
it
read
the
visitor
had
come
strolling
from
the
direction
of
some
summer
cottages
near
a
pretty
lake
close
by
grimshaw
surmised
that
he
was
one
of
the
smart
set
spending
an
outing
there
observed
the
young
man
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
and
a
scowl
independent
you
i
think
change
your
tune
that
so
fancy
bring
somebody
with
me
who
will
do
what
he
chooses
with
your
precious
old
airship
and
send
you
about
your
business
if
he
feels
like
the
young
man
turned
on
his
heel
mad
as
a
hornet
as
he
spoke
just
then
the
gate
was
pushed
open
and
a
athletic
young
fellow
stepped
into
view
the
trouble
grimshaw
he
asked
pleasantly
of
those
pestiferous
nuisances
who
want
to
pry
into
other
business
and
think
they
own
the
world
grumbled
the
veteran
aeronaut
did
he
want
john
grimshaw
told
his
story
you
might
have
gratified
his
curiosity
and
let
him
look
around
a
here
dave
dashaway
bristled
up
grimshaw
seen
in
the
past
what
taking
in
a
stranger
led
to
here
for
a
special
purpose
and
no
jerry
dawson
or
fellows
of
that
stripe
are
going
to
get
a
chance
to
trick
us
so
grimshaw
we
be
too
careful
i
will
admit
agreed
the
young
aviator
he
was
a
rather
unassuming
young
fellow
for
a
person
of
his
merits
and
record
was
this
active
lad
who
inside
of
three
months
had
made
his
way
from
humble
circumstances
to
the
very
front
rank
of
american
airmen
dave
dashaway
looked
back
over
the
past
twelve
weeks
of
his
young
career
with
pride
pleasure
and
satisfaction
there
were
dark
spots
of
course
the
jerry
dawson
old
grimshaw
had
mentioned
was
one
of
them
envious
rivals
there
had
been
too
danger
scheming
cunning
had
more
than
once
threatened
that
bright
breezy
afternoon
however
the
accredited
pilot
of
the
latest
monoplane
on
exhibition
dave
dashaway
felt
like
a
general
who
had
won
a
battle
and
was
resting
on
his
laurels
those
who
have
read
the
first
volume
of
the
present
series
entitled
dashaway
the
young
aviator
or
in
the
clouds
for
fame
and
fortune
will
recall
how
humble
and
difficult
was
the
start
in
life
made
by
the
bright
young
aeronaut
the
father
of
dave
had
been
a
noted
balloonist
dave
was
of
tender
age
when
he
died
for
years
the
boy
was
made
a
drudge
by
a
miserly
old
guardian
the
finding
of
a
prize
medal
and
other
valuables
accidentally
lost
from
an
airship
sent
dave
on
his
travels
seeking
their
owner
robert
king
a
noted
airman
who
gave
dave
a
job
it
seemed
as
though
air
sailing
was
born
in
dave
he
took
to
aviation
like
a
duck
does
to
water
the
youth
did
several
helpful
things
at
the
various
aero
meets
for
king
that
won
his
confidence
and
friendship
dave
studied
all
the
books
he
could
get
hold
of
on
airships
and
grimshaw
a
crippled
and
retired
balloonist
took
him
into
his
school
from
the
initial
run
made
on
a
dummy
aeroplane
along
the
ground
to
his
first
aerial
flight
in
a
monoplane
with
king
dave
showed
intelligence
skill
and
ambition
then
came
his
first
brilliant
flight
in
the
a
show
biplane
so
well
did
the
young
aviator
manage
the
that
its
owner
the
interstate
aero
company
made
a
contract
with
him
for
regular
exhibitions
dave
did
not
disappoint
his
liberal
employers
in
his
efforts
he
won
several
prizes
gave
a
big
lift
to
a
chum
hiram
dobbs
in
the
aero
field
and
made
old
grimshaw
proud
of
so
apt
a
pupil
in
the
second
volume
of
the
present
series
called
dashaway
and
his
hydroplane
or
daring
adventures
over
the
great
lakes
is
told
how
dave
advanced
another
important
step
up
the
ladder
of
fame
and
fortune
the
company
employing
him
started
him
at
exhibiting
their
model
hydroplane
this
was
a
new
venture
for
dave
but
he
industriously
mastered
its
details
and
made
a
great
hit
at
an
aero
meet
near
chicago
all
along
the
line
dave
had
been
forced
to
oppose
the
envy
and
malice
of
unprincipled
business
rivals
by
thinking
straight
and
acting
straight
however
he
had
won
out
on
every
occasion
as
an
honest
deserving
lad
always
does
he
and
his
young
protege
hiram
dobbs
by
making
a
hundred
mile
record
flight
one
dark
and
stormy
night
got
a
big
order
for
the
interstate
aero
company
ahead
of
a
competitor
then
jerry
dawson
his
father
and
a
smuggler
stole
the
and
located
across
the
canadian
border
dave
and
his
friends
began
a
wonderful
chase
in
another
machine
they
had
some
stirring
adventures
ending
in
the
discovery
of
the
that
incident
shut
out
the
dawsons
from
later
aero
meets
but
as
they
had
not
been
prosecuted
they
became
at
circus
and
county
fair
exhibitions
dave
heard
of
them
once
in
awhile
but
they
seemed
unlikely
to
injure
him
any
farther
dave
and
hiram
were
finely
rewarded
by
the
interstate
people
for
their
success
the
company
wanted
dave
to
make
a
contract
to
exhibit
their
machines
dave
however
was
obliged
to
decline
the
offer
there
was
a
strong
reason
for
reason
that
was
enough
to
set
on
fire
the
enthusiasm
of
any
live
boy
as
related
in
the
preceding
volume
dave
had
discovered
an
old
friend
of
his
dead
father
one
cyrus
dale
this
gentleman
was
wealthy
had
no
family
and
had
been
a
fellow
balloonist
of
dashaway
years
before
a
boy
who
had
stolen
some
papers
from
dave
had
succeeded
in
palming
himself
off
on
dale
as
dave
dashaway
king
had
unmasked
the
imposter
the
latter
with
some
friends
had
then
kidnapped
dale
the
veteran
aviator
robert
king
had
rescued
dale
from
their
clutches
the
gratitude
of
the
latter
for
this
act
together
with
his
warm
interest
in
dave
had
led
to
the
three
coming
together
in
a
most
friendly
way
it
was
this
ideal
situation
which
had
resulted
in
the
carrying
out
of
a
plan
of
king
this
was
nothing
less
than
a
scheme
for
crossing
the
atlantic
in
a
giant
airship
it
had
been
the
pet
idea
of
the
skilled
aviator
for
hope
and
dream
of
every
ambitious
airman
in
the
world
of
all
men
in
the
field
king
had
the
ability
to
direct
such
a
project
dale
was
not
only
willing
but
ready
to
supply
the
capital
as
to
dave
and
hiram
they
talked
constantly
of
the
enterprise
daytimes
and
dreamed
of
it
nights
the
plan
of
the
veteran
aviator
however
was
one
that
involved
time
skill
and
expense
his
plans
for
building
the
great
airship
were
very
elaborate
a
month
had
now
gone
by
and
only
the
skeleton
of
the
mammoth
air
traveler
had
so
far
been
constructed
a
temporary
aerodrome
had
been
constructed
on
the
edge
of
a
large
city
about
miles
from
lake
linden
where
we
find
the
young
aviator
at
the
opening
of
the
present
story
there
king
dale
and
some
skilled
workmen
were
energetically
pushing
forward
their
work
if
their
plans
did
not
go
awry
before
the
end
of
august
the
giant
airship
would
start
out
on
the
strangest
grandest
trip
ever
attempted
in
the
field
of
aeronautics
in
the
meantime
the
interstate
aero
company
had
prevailed
on
dave
to
give
them
a
special
service
this
comprised
the
exhibition
of
their
latest
the
at
lake
linden
the
district
was
one
visited
every
summer
by
men
of
wealth
from
new
york
boston
and
other
large
cities
the
interstate
people
had
secured
what
had
once
been
a
small
private
park
here
dave
hiram
and
grimshaw
had
been
located
for
over
a
week
the
object
of
their
exhibitions
was
to
influence
a
sale
of
the
interstate
machines
among
the
rich
men
visiting
lake
linden
many
of
them
were
aero
enthusiasts
besides
that
the
proprietors
of
the
resort
paid
the
company
quite
a
large
fee
for
making
occasional
flights
as
an
attraction
to
popularize
the
lake
dave
glanced
after
the
man
who
had
just
had
the
verbal
tussle
with
grimshaw
he
did
not
like
his
trivial
looks
any
more
than
the
old
balloonist
had
they
had
many
curious
visitors
at
the
enclosure
however
and
dave
forgot
the
strange
brag
of
the
latest
one
as
he
looked
down
the
road
in
the
direction
of
the
town
of
linden
strange
hiram
get
back
with
the
carryall
remarked
the
young
aviator
i
heard
the
train
come
in
half
an
hour
ago
replied
grimshaw
quite
a
crowd
you
dashaway
yes
according
to
the
message
the
interstate
people
sent
me
said
dave
seems
there
is
a
special
party
of
foreign
airmen
our
new
york
salesman
has
interested
some
of
them
have
come
over
to
take
a
try
at
the
meets
in
the
southern
circuit
and
want
to
buy
find
ours
the
best
asserted
grimshaw
think
that
too
agreed
dave
why
got
everything
spick
and
span
inside
there
the
looks
as
if
she
was
just
waiting
to
float
like
an
eagle
at
the
a
beauty
and
no
mistake
declared
grimshaw
and
like
some
ardent
horseman
gazing
at
a
fond
pet
he
pushed
open
the
gate
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
in
the
middle
of
the
enclosure
the
last
word
in
airships
boasted
the
old
enthusiast
trial
flight
of
yours
yesterday
dashaway
was
the
prettiest
piece
of
air
work
i
ever
intimate
as
the
young
aviator
was
with
the
and
every
detail
of
her
delicate
mechanism
he
could
not
resist
the
fascination
of
looking
over
the
most
beautiful
model
in
the
airship
field
the
had
proven
a
revelation
even
to
skilled
airmen
it
had
been
constructed
in
strict
secrecy
the
public
had
known
nothing
as
to
the
details
of
the
craft
until
it
was
taken
out
on
lake
linden
to
test
its
balance
and
speed
it
was
equipped
to
carry
four
passengers
was
driven
by
a
forty
motor
and
made
the
tremendous
speed
of
fifty
miles
an
hour
in
the
water
and
sixty
miles
an
hour
in
the
air
with
its
two
propellers
driven
by
clutch
and
chain
transmission
and
its
new
automatic
starter
and
fuel
gauge
it
was
a
marvel
of
beauty
and
utility
as
readily
sent
up
from
the
confined
deck
of
a
warship
as
from
the
broadest
aero
field
a
bird
sure
enough
declared
old
grimshaw
admiringly
she
sort
of
built
for
a
bird
challenged
dave
with
a
smile
so
ah
i
hear
the
wagon
hiram
is
the
two
went
outside
the
enclosure
and
the
man
looked
keenly
down
the
road
in
the
direction
of
the
village
dashaway
he
exclaimed
hiram
but
he
bringing
the
party
you
queer
commented
the
young
aviator
all
no
he
got
one
passenger
girl
repeated
dave
staring
somewhat
mystified
at
the
approaching
vehicle
queerer
still
remarked
the
young
aviator
chapter
ii
sang
out
hiram
dobbs
bringing
the
team
to
a
halt
and
beckoning
to
dave
the
trouble
hiram
inquired
the
young
aviator
come
no
word
from
them
yes
there
was
a
wire
and
friend
and
assistant
handed
a
yellow
sheet
to
dave
with
the
explanation
at
the
station
gave
it
to
me
that
way
a
rush
so
i
read
all
right
returned
dave
and
he
also
read
the
brief
dispatch
in
his
turn
it
stated
that
there
had
come
an
unexpected
hitch
in
the
arrangements
of
the
new
york
agent
of
the
interstate
people
and
that
the
party
he
had
in
tow
would
not
visit
lake
linden
until
the
following
day
good
said
dave
will
give
us
a
chance
to
go
to
the
city
and
see
how
our
giant
airship
scheme
is
coming
applauded
hiram
something
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
first
though
that
hiram
a
moment
hiram
interrupted
with
these
words
addressed
to
the
only
passenger
in
the
carryall
for
the
first
time
dave
glanced
at
her
closely
she
was
a
girl
of
about
sixteen
her
eyes
were
red
with
weeping
she
held
a
handkerchief
in
her
hand
and
was
pale
and
seemed
greatly
distressed
i
must
make
you
no
farther
trouble
she
said
in
a
broken
tone
will
get
out
of
the
carryall
here
and
walk
the
rest
of
the
way
to
the
want
to
speak
to
my
friend
here
first
miss
said
hiram
just
wait
maybe
he
can
suggest
some
way
to
help
you
have
been
so
kind
to
me
already
murmured
the
girl
dave
wondered
what
was
up
the
carryall
was
a
hired
one
and
he
had
supposed
at
first
that
hiram
had
given
the
girl
a
lift
finding
she
was
going
his
way
hiram
was
always
doing
such
kindly
things
the
forlorn
appearance
of
the
girl
however
and
the
rather
serious
manner
of
hiram
as
he
jumped
from
the
wagon
seat
and
beckoned
dave
out
of
earshot
of
his
passenger
made
the
young
aviator
surmise
that
he
had
something
of
particular
moment
to
impart
to
him
then
what
is
it
hiram
he
asked
see
that
girl
never
felt
so
sorry
for
anyone
in
my
life
as
i
do
for
is
she
poor
girl
working
her
way
through
the
young
seminary
up
at
the
other
end
of
the
i
seems
she
got
a
telegram
about
an
hour
ago
it
is
from
her
home
a
hundred
miles
west
of
here
it
stated
that
her
mother
was
in
a
critical
condition
and
if
she
expected
to
see
her
alive
she
must
take
the
first
train
for
easton
she
hurried
to
the
depot
i
found
her
there
crying
as
if
her
heart
would
girl
she
had
missed
the
just
four
minutes
and
no
other
until
eight
this
am
dreadfully
sorry
for
her
said
dave
glancing
with
genuine
sympathy
at
the
girl
in
the
carryall
hiram
fidgeted
about
he
dug
the
toe
of
his
shoe
into
the
dirt
then
he
looked
dave
daringly
in
the
eye
then
he
dropped
his
glance
dave
was
quick
to
read
his
impetuous
and
thoughts
fancy
i
guess
in
your
mind
hiram
he
said
hope
you
do
anyhow
say
if
i
knew
how
to
run
an
airship
like
run
it
to
easton
i
suppose
intimated
dave
sir
just
what
i
would
do
see
here
dave
suppose
you
had
a
sister
in
the
trouble
that
young
girl
is
in
dave
put
up
his
hand
interruptingly
his
face
was
earnest
and
serious
get
her
to
her
mother
if
i
had
to
sell
the
shoes
off
my
feet
a
fellow
hiram
dobbs
and
as
not
let
you
beat
me
in
the
line
take
her
to
her
mother
in
the
fairly
shouted
hiram
dancing
from
one
foot
to
the
other
in
his
excitement
over
such
a
prospect
try
and
make
it
out
that
way
responded
dave
me
think
for
a
minute
or
two
the
young
aviator
took
another
look
at
the
mournful
face
of
the
young
girl
in
the
carryall
then
he
made
up
his
mind
he
was
a
employe
of
the
interstate
aero
company
and
pretty
nearly
at
liberty
to
do
as
he
pleased
dave
looked
up
at
the
sky
made
some
mental
calculations
and
said
finally
her
who
i
am
want
to
have
a
little
talk
with
is
my
best
friend
dave
dashaway
name
is
amy
winston
spoke
the
girl
a
trifle
shy
and
embarrassed
dobbs

told
me
about
your
trouble
miss
winston
said
dave
is
a
fine
fellow
and
feels
sorry
for
you

we
are
going
to
try
and
get

your
home
within
the
next
three
if
you
only
could
exclaimed
the
young
girl
anxiously
there
is
no
train
until
this
is
true
replied
dave
see
dave
is
a
great
aviator
miss
broke
in
hiram
in
his
usual
impulsive
explosive
way
taken
lots
of
prizes
he
won
will
do
hiram
laughed
dave
truth
is
miss
winston
he
continued
to
the
puzzled
girl
have
only
one
way
of
getting
you
to
your
home
please
step
down
and
i
will
show
you
what
it
dave
helped
the
girl
down
the
steps
at
the
rear
of
the
vehicle
he
led
her
to
the
gates
of
the
enclosure
and
drew
one
of
them
wide
open
it
is
an
airship
exclaimed
amy
winston
saw
it
yesterday
from
the
seminary
was
running
it
and
i
was
aboard
boasted
hiram
proudly
beautifully
it
sailed
murmured
the
girl
winston
spoke
dave
can
make
easton
in
about
three
hours
in
that
machine
it
may
be
something
i
should
not
propose
considering
the
possible
risk
but
the
is
at
your
exclaimed
amy
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
of
gratitude
and
hope
would
dare
any
danger
to
once
more
see
my
dear
mother
before
she
are
willing
to
try
it
asked
dave
definitely
amy
was
trembling
but
she
answered
bravely
in
the
affirmative
grimshaw
said
dave
to
his
friend
who
at
once
started
off
to
obey
the
order
miss
winston
continued
the
young
aviator
will
help
you
to
a
seat
in
the
when
the
girl
had
been
disposed
of
in
the
most
comfortable
seat
in
the
dave
gave
her
a
strap
to
draw
her
dress
skirt
tightly
about
her
feet
other
straps
bound
her
in
the
seat
so
that
by
no
possibility
could
she
fall
or
be
thrown
out
the
girl
had
grown
a
shade
paler
and
was
all
in
a
flutter
but
she
did
not
show
the
least
inclination
to
draw
back
from
an
exploit
that
would
start
most
people
into
hysterics
dave
went
into
the
tent
where
he
and
hiram
and
grimshaw
ate
and
slept
and
came
out
in
aviation
garb
he
took
some
time
looking
over
a
guide
book
meanwhile
his
two
helpers
had
been
working
about
the
getting
everything
in
order
grimshaw
made
no
comment
on
the
occasion
while
he
always
resented
any
intrusion
of
outsiders
at
aerodrome
or
meet
he
had
long
since
made
up
his
mind
that
dave
knew
his
business
and
was
just
about
right
in
everything
he
did
the
old
expert
went
over
the
as
thoroughly
as
if
the
machine
was
bound
on
a
long
distance
flight
he
saw
to
it
that
nothing
was
lacking
that
an
air
navigator
might
need
he
even
set
the
green
lantern
on
the
right
side
and
the
red
to
the
left
steamship
code
in
case
of
some
delay
or
accident
whereby
the
might
drift
up
against
night
work
out
for
a
change
in
the
wind
was
parting
injunction
looks
like
a
coming
squall
in
the
northwest
replied
dave
i
think
this
head
wind
will
hold
till
we
get
out
of
range
all
ready
miss
winston
sir
fluttered
the
little
lady
holding
tightly
to
the
arms
of
her
seat
behind
the
post
although
she
was
securely
tied
in
free
said
dave
simply
and
his
helpers
stood
aside
as
the
was
set
in
motion
the
rose
lightly
as
a
bird
just
above
the
fence
line
however
dave
slightly
turned
his
head
at
an
unusual
sound
he
had
just
a
glimpse
of
two
figures
acting
rather
wildly
immediately
beyond
the
enclosure
one
was
the
foppish
fellow
who
had
recently
been
repulsed
by
grimshaw
and
who
had
made
the
strange
threat
that
he
would
bring
somebody
with
him
who
would
settle
affairs
apparently
this
vaunted
individual
was
now
in
his
company
he
was
a
richly
dressed
lad
somewhat
older
than
dave
he
seemed
to
be
a
good
deal
excited
about
something
acted
as
grimshaw
had
described
it
as
if
he
owned
the
world
his
companion
was
waving
his
cane
angrily
as
the
airship
shot
skyward
the
boy
himself
shook
his
fists
toward
the
and
shouted
out
furiously
some
command
or
threat
the
young
aviator
could
not
make
out
dave
wondered
what
this
second
visit
meant
he
had
no
time
nor
thought
to
spare
either
staring
or
guessing
however
eye
hand
and
brain
were
centered
intently
upon
his
task
dave
for
the
moment
forgot
everything
except
that
he
was
directing
to
a
safe
steady
course
a
mechanism
as
delicate
and
sensitive
as
the
works
of
a
fine
chronometer
he
caught
the
echo
of
a
low
quick
respiration
from
the
girl
behind
him
the
suddenness
of
the
ascent
had
acted
on
her
as
it
did
on
every
novice
producing
a
startled
feeling
then
as
the
whirled
three
hundred
feet
high
and
the
swaying
gliding
exhilaration
of
perfect
motion
followed
a
breath
told
of
relief
and
satisfaction
be
frightened
miss
winston
called
out
dave
venturing
a
quick
glance
at
his
passenger
whose
eyes
surveyed
the
panorama
beneath
them
in
speechless
wonderment
i
am
not
indeed
cried
amy
winston
is
only
the
are
perfectly
safe
assured
the
young
aviator
have
made
a
splendid
start
just
think
of
your
mother
he
added
very
gently
feel
certain
that
we
can
make
easton
inside
of
two
am
so
glad
oh
so
glad
replied
amy
with
grateful
tears
in
her
eyes
dave
was
pleased
that
his
course
towards
easton
took
him
due
southwest
a
breeze
was
coming
from
that
direction
this
was
a
perfect
condition
for
even
stable
progress
over
towards
the
northwest
a
bank
of
ominous
black
clouds
were
coming
up
threatening
a
gale
and
a
deluge
of
rain
the
young
pilot
of
the
planned
and
hoped
to
dodge
this
storm
by
fast
flying
the
southern
edge
of
the
big
cloud
began
to
cover
the
sky
ahead
of
dave
once
or
twice
there
were
contrary
gusts
and
he
had
to
do
some
skillful
engineering
to
preserve
a
safe
balance
he
felt
considerably
relieved
to
observe
that
the
was
safely
out
of
range
of
the
real
storm
center
some
masses
thrown
out
from
the
main
body
were
however
scudding
ahead
of
him
there
were
one
or
two
spatters
of
rain
to
the
far
right
of
him
dave
could
tell
that
a
momentary
tornado
was
sweeping
the
tops
of
the
trees
he
set
the
lever
to
the
limit
notch
made
a
long
volplane
and
then
a
wide
circuit
to
the
south
believe
we
are
out
of
range
dave
told
himself
hopefully
then
as
a
sudden
and
unexpected
shock
announced
the
meeting
of
two
powerful
forces
he
sat
motionless
and
helpless
the
young
aviator
faced
a
mishap
most
dreaded
of
all
that
threaten
the
safety
of
the
expert
aeronaut
chapter
iii
a
narrow
escape
the
had
struck
hole
in
the
air
are
lost
thought
dave
dashaway
the
young
aviator
was
not
prone
to
arrive
at
senseless
conclusions
he
had
made
a
practical
study
of
aeronautics
in
a
way
from
the
first
time
the
pioneer
airman
harnessed
a
gasoline
engine
to
a
kite
and
called
it
a
flying
machine
down
to
the
somersault
trick
in
aviation
a
in
the
to
the
sky
traveler
is
what
a
yawning
chasm
is
to
a
speeding
automobile
or
an
unexpected
cataract
to
a
hydroplane
it
is
worse
than
a
motor
or
even
a
threatened
every
part
of
the
machine
suddenly
goes
useless
the
heavy
mechanism
simply
drops
in
a
word
the
had
been
caught
in
a
dead
void
caused
by
two
opposing
air
currents
colliding
and
shutting
the
machine
into
an
absolute
pocket
or
vacuum
if
dave
had
remained
inert
or
had
hesitated
for
a
single
instant
of
time
the
would
have
been
doomed
a
slender
thread
of
hope
presented
itself
and
he
was
quick
to
utilize
it
to
the
limit
the
air
with
one
cheek
he
noticed
the
tail
of
the
machine
give
a
quick
switch
this
he
at
once
understood
indicated
that
the
master
air
current
was
from
the
north
dave
hoped
there
was
power
enough
left
in
the
propellers
to
make
a
sharp
quick
turn
he
set
the
apparatus
for
the
speediest
whirl
he
had
ever
attempted
the
machine
was
tipping
dropping
steadily
dave
banked
to
the
left
at
a
most
critical
angle
there
was
a
dizzying
spin
and
then
a
dive
a
great
breath
of
relief
swept
from
lips
as
the
righted
the
wings
caught
the
violent
blast
of
the
gust
and
the
machine
fairly
bored
its
way
ahead
true
as
an
arrow
into
the
teeth
of
the
storm
a
drenching
shower
shut
the
aerial
wayfarers
into
a
blinding
deluge
of
rain
drops
then
their
course
lightened
and
dave
knew
that
the
thinning
veil
of
moisture
indicated
sunlight
beyond
it
he
shut
down
speed
slightly
the
air
pressure
was
fast
decreasing
as
the
emerged
from
the
clouds
dave
gradually
worked
the
head
of
the
machine
due
southwest
once
more
the
former
head
wind
was
regained
and
sunny
progress
offered
beyond
close
shave
said
dave
to
himself
and
turned
to
see
how
his
passenger
had
taken
it
suppose
that
scared
you
somewhat
miss
winston
he
remarked
face
was
pale
and
she
showed
the
strain
of
her
startling
experience
but
she
replied
could
not
be
frightened
with
you
anybody
as
kind
and
thoughtful
as
you
are
to
a
poor
girl
in
distress
like
myself
could
not
be
anything
but
heart
warmed
at
the
compliment
he
admired
the
girl
too
as
he
thought
back
he
realized
that
his
nerves
had
been
at
a
tension
where
any
outcry
or
movement
on
the
part
of
his
passenger
might
have
upset
his
and
have
prevented
the
prompt
action
which
had
saved
the
day
he
felt
proud
and
pleased
at
his
success
in
turning
a
hard
corner
his
passenger
too
became
more
as
the
prospect
of
soon
reaching
the
side
of
her
invalid
mother
became
more
assured
once
or
twice
as
they
flew
over
chicken
coops
in
farm
yards
there
was
great
excitement
beneath
them
and
she
could
not
help
but
smile
is
easton
she
leaned
over
finally
to
say
to
dave
as
the
steeples
and
factory
chimneys
of
a
little
town
came
into
view
the
girl
pointed
out
her
home
a
few
minutes
later
and
dave
prepared
to
make
a
landing
the
came
to
earth
in
the
middle
of
a
field
a
few
hundred
yards
distant
from
the
house
the
girl
had
designated
long
before
dave
had
released
the
ropes
that
had
held
his
passenger
in
her
seat
people
who
had
viewed
the
novelty
of
a
real
airship
came
flocking
to
the
spot
from
all
directions
amy
seized
the
hands
of
the
young
aviator
bubbling
over
with
gratitude
she
tried
to
thank
him
as
she
wished
to
but
the
words
would
not
come
delay
miss
winston
said
dave
know
they
must
be
very
anxious
about
you
at
dave
led
his
little
charge
to
the
fence
surrounding
the
field
and
helped
her
over
it
then
he
returned
to
the
he
found
that
the
propellers
had
gone
through
some
strain
during
his
adventure
in
the
storm
and
he
had
some
little
work
to
do
with
chisel
hammer
and
wrench
while
he
was
thus
occupied
almost
a
mob
surrounded
the
airship
curious
gaping
and
delighted
a
man
wearing
a
big
star
and
evidently
the
policeman
of
the
town
made
himself
very
officious
keeping
the
crowd
back
he
had
seen
an
airship
once
at
a
county
fair
and
paraded
his
knowledge
now
he
tried
industriously
to
make
himself
very
agreeable
to
the
young
aviator
dave
had
to
laugh
secretly
to
himself
as
the
man
pinched
his
fingers
describing
to
a
local
newspaper
man
that
this
was
the
magneto
and
that
the
the
carburetor
must
have
been
reading
up
on
airships
spoke
the
newspaper
man
to
the
policeman
as
the
latter
walked
importantly
about
the
craft
now
and
then
sternly
calling
on
some
small
lad
to
back
out
have
came
the
confident
answer
know
a
lot
about
of
course
i
ever
sailed
in
one
but
my
brother
a
policeman
in
long
island
and
once
when
i
was
on
a
visit
to
him
he
was
detailed
to
go
out
to
a
place
where
they
was
one
of
these
airyplane
contests
and
keep
order
i
went
with
him
and
he
swore
me
in
as
his
deputy
assistant
i
seen
a
lot
of
them
foreign
fellers
fly
and
i
picked
up
a
lot
of
suppose
so
murmured
the
newspaper
man
who
was
new
in
town
and
did
not
know
enough
to
discount
the
boasting
talk
of
the
officer
indeed
went
on
the
constable
once
one
of
them
call
you
know
he
explained
as
though
he
knew
it
all
one
of
run
out
of
gasoline
just
as
he
was
to
start
in
a
prize
flight
and
if
it
been
for
me
never
won
that
asked
the
reporter
i
hustled
over
to
the
the
french
word
for
a
balloon
shed
he
explained
condescendingly
rushed
over
to
the
hangar
and
got
him
a
can
of
gasoline
and
he
went
up
as
slick
as
anything
and
won
the
prize
he
said
i
helped
him
a
lot
and
he
gave
me
a
dollar
i
want
to
take
it
but
he
insisted
oh
i
know
a
lot
about
dave
was
so
busy
tightening
some
of
the
guy
wires
that
had
come
loosened
at
the
turn
buckle
by
reason
of
the
great
strain
that
he
paid
little
attention
to
the
reporter
and
the
constable
for
a
few
minutes
the
young
aviator
however
noticed
that
the
officious
officer
was
becoming
more
and
more
familiar
with
the
machine
touching
the
different
parts
often
calling
them
by
their
wrong
names
and
totally
unconscious
of
his
errors
nor
was
the
reporter
any
the
wiser
exactly
understand
what
makes
the
airship
move
confessed
the
newspaper
man
to
the
instructor
these
here
perpellers
explained
the
constable
work
just
like
an
electric
fan
you
see
but
then
the
blades
of
an
electric
fan
go
around
but
the
fan
sail
in
the
air
why
is
that
something
i
forgot
to
explain
said
the
constable
quickly
finding
himself
unexpectedly
in
deep
water
tell
you
about
the
perpellers
later
this
the
radiator
he
went
on
full
of
water
just
like
in
the
radiator
of
an
automobile
and
it
keeps
the
gasoline
from
boiling
it
off
you
said
the
reporter
who
knew
a
little
about
autos
i
thought
the
water
was
to
keep
the
engine
from
getting
in
an
airship
insisted
the
constable
an
airyplane
the
radiator
keeps
the
gasoline
cool
jest
show
you
how
it
works
and
before
dave
could
stop
the
man
he
had
opened
a
small
faucet
in
the
radiator
designed
to
drain
out
the
water
now
it
happened
that
dave
had
been
running
his
engine
very
fast
and
in
consequence
the
water
in
the
really
did
cool
the
motor
and
not
the
water
was
very
fact
some
steam
was
present
no
sooner
did
the
meddlesome
constable
open
the
that
a
jet
of
steam
shot
out
burning
his
fingers
severely
the
man
jumped
back
with
an
exclamation
of
pain
know
it
was
so
hot
he
cried
must
be
a
new
cooling
system
using
on
this
should
say
it
was
more
like
a
system
remarked
the
reporter
with
a
smile
he
could
not
conceal
ha
shiner
got
burned
yelled
a
small
boy
who
had
been
ordered
away
from
the
craft
got
burned
ha
ha
a
cup
of
tea
shiner
yelled
another
lad
evidently
being
the
nickname
you
if
i
git
holt
of
you
he
threatened
rushing
forward
with
some
of
his
fingers
in
his
mouth
to
render
the
pain
less
it
was
not
a
very
dignified
attitude
for
a
guardian
of
the
law
wish
shut
that
cried
dave
who
was
busy
tightening
a
part
that
he
could
not
very
well
leave
just
then
that
water
off
or
lose
all
there
is
in
the
radiator
and
have
to
put
in
too
hot
objected
the
constable
his
attention
drawn
from
the
annoying
lads
know
it
was
so
warm
what
system
do
you
use
dave
was
too
annoyed
to
answer
and
the
constable
not
wishing
to
burn
himself
again
held
back
meanwhile
water
and
steam
were
spurting
from
the
shut
it
off
volunteered
the
reporter
feeling
that
he
was
partly
to
blame
for
the
incident
since
he
had
evinced
a
curiosity
that
the
constable
had
tried
to
gratify
the
newspaper
man
advanced
toward
the
radiator
which
was
now
enveloped
in
steam
dave
saw
that
he
had
on
no
gloves
out
cried
the
young
aviator
get
a
bad
burn
very
hot
here
he
added
these
pliers
and
turn
that
valve
do
it
myself
only
if
i
let
go
this
wire
it
will
slip
and
i
easily
get
it
in
place
again
and
dave
indicated
where
a
pair
of
pliers
lay
on
the
ground
get
you
said
the
reporter
with
a
smile
a
moment
later
he
had
shut
the
and
the
stream
of
water
and
the
hissing
steam
stopped
but
this
burns
exclaimed
the
constable
forgot
about
the
radiator
part
some
airships
have
not
asked
the
reporter
what
i
was
telling
you
about
the
perpellers
they
make
the
ship
go
you
see
you
turn
them
around
to
start
the
engine
jest
like
you
crank
an
auto
i
guess
i
can
turn
them
over
though
pretty
hard
down
on
long
island
where
my
brother
was
that
time
i
helped
one
of
the
birdmen
lots
you
jest
do
it
this
way
and
he
advanced
toward
the
big
wooden
propeller
touch
that
cried
dave
but
he
was
too
late
the
officious
constable
whirled
the
wooden
blade
around
as
it
happened
dave
had
turned
on
the
switch
in
order
to
make
a
test
and
had
forgotten
until
that
moment
to
turn
it
off
but
when
he
saw
what
the
man
was
going
to
do
he
realized
what
would
happen
that
alone
he
cried
being
unable
to
get
out
as
he
was
straddling
one
of
the
runners
to
tighten
a
wire
the
constable
gave
the
apparatus
another
turn
and
with
a
rattle
and
bang
like
a
salvo
of
musketry
the
motor
started
now
there
is
considerable
power
to
an
has
to
be
to
make
the
craft
sail
as
the
blades
whirled
about
they
fairly
blew
the
constable
back
out
of
the
way
his
helmet
went
sailing
off
tossed
by
the
terrific
wind
created
and
only
that
he
jumped
aside
in
time
he
would
have
been
hurt
the
airship
too
would
have
moved
off
only
dave
had
left
the
on
this
halted
it
long
enough
for
the
young
aviator
to
leap
out
and
shut
off
the
switch
the
lad
cried
to
the
constable
a
good
notion
know
it
would
start
cried
the
man
finally
managing
to
get
on
his
feet
for
he
had
staggered
back
so
fast
that
he
fell
know
it
would
do
that
guess
go
up
to
the
drug
store
and
get
something
for
my
burned
fingers
and
not
stopping
to
give
any
more
information
to
the
newspaper
man
the
officer
hurried
off
amid
the
laughter
of
the
crowd
it
took
dave
half
an
hour
to
get
the
machine
as
he
wanted
he
had
a
pleasant
chat
with
the
local
reporter
who
was
immensely
interested
dave
got
ready
to
start
back
for
home
when
a
young
fellow
about
his
own
age
made
his
way
hurriedly
through
the
crowd
our
hero
observed
his
resemblance
to
his
recent
passenger
he
was
excited
and
eager
and
seized
hand
with
great
warmth
are
dashaway
he
spoke
i
am
dave
dashaway
replied
the
young
aviator
pleasantly
sister
sent
me
oh
how
we
want
to
thank
you
and
the
tears
began
to
fall
down
the
cheeks
of
the
manly
young
fellow
is
your
mother
asked
dave
embarrassed
at
the
growing
attention
of
the
listening
crowd
about
them
it
it
exclaimed
young
winston
brokenly
saved
her
oh
think
of
it
the
doctor
says
she
die
now
dave
tried
to
quiet
the
agitated
lad
but
the
latter
would
have
his
say
from
his
incoherent
talk
dave
gathered
that
winston
had
indeed
been
near
death
the
main
trouble
was
that
she
imagined
her
daughter
amy
had
died
away
from
home
the
return
had
quieted
the
frantic
sufferer
she
had
received
amy
in
a
wild
transport
of
delight
then
she
had
gone
to
sleep
in
her
arms
happy
and
quiet
the
fever
broken
and
the
doctor
had
announced
that
the
crisis
was
past
the
crowd
began
to
get
wind
of
the
pretty
little
story
of
heroism
the
newspaper
man
was
excitedly
taking
notes
the
policeman
looked
proud
at
having
something
of
importance
happen
in
the
town
of
which
he
was
the
public
guardian
and
the
crowd
began
to
shout
handsome
things
at
dave
the
young
aviator
was
actually
blushing
as
he
started
the
again
cheers
of
genuine
enthusiasm
rang
out
three
times
three
and
many
times
over
as
the
machine
shot
skyward
then
as
dave
caught
sight
of
a
little
lady
waving
a
handkerchief
at
him
from
the
front
porch
of
the
winston
home
he
felt
somehow
as
if
a
real
blessing
had
been
bestowed
upon
him
a
good
deal
to
be
an
airman
dave
told
himself
a
good
deal
more
to
be
able
to
do
a
kind
deed
and
make
others
happy
he
added
so
glad
that
he
had
been
of
service
to
amy
winston
that
he
would
have
been
willing
to
go
through
the
daring
adventure
all
over
again
the
skies
had
cleared
in
every
direction
the
machinery
of
the
worked
to
a
charm
on
the
return
trip
to
lake
linden
the
dial
showed
a
trifle
over
two
hundred
miles
in
five
hours
and
a
half
dave
made
a
run
for
the
turning
bar
in
one
corner
of
the
enclosure
to
get
the
stiffness
out
of
his
limbs
then
he
hurried
over
to
the
living
tent
glad
that
he
had
an
interesting
story
to
tell
to
his
fellow
airmen
here
he
remarked
looking
around
grimshaw
and
hiram
must
have
gone
to
town
probably
expect
me
home
so
there
spoke
an
unexpected
voice
dave
turned
quickly
two
persons
had
passed
the
gates
and
were
approaching
him
he
recognized
them
at
once
one
was
the
man
he
had
seen
twice
before
the
other
was
the
boy
who
had
shaken
his
fist
at
dave
when
the
had
started
on
the
hasty
trip
to
easton
at
closer
sight
than
before
the
young
aviator
instantly
read
his
visitors
as
in
a
book
the
elder
of
the
twain
was
about
or
thirty
years
of
age
and
all
his
elegant
attire
and
rather
handsome
face
did
not
disguise
his
resemblance
to
some
shrewd
sharper
who
made
his
way
in
the
world
by
living
on
others
the
boy
suggested
the
spoiled
scion
of
some
wealthy
family
with
plenty
of
money
and
used
to
spending
it
foolishly
his
face
was
flushed
and
excited
and
dave
decided
that
he
was
under
a
very
baneful
influence
in
the
company
he
kept
he
was
the
first
to
speak
are
dashaway
i
suppose
he
observed
in
a
careless
almost
insolent
way
said
dave
this
is
my
friend
vernon
was
here
before
know
he
was
replied
dave
is
the
old
fellow
who
was
so
saucy
to
him
do
you
want
to
know
for
demanded
dave
unable
to
keep
from
getting
a
trifle
angry
due
for
a
trimming
why
i
allow
my
friends
to
be
treated
that
way
see
here
i
suppose
you
know
who
i
am
observed
the
speaker
with
an
air
of
that
was
almost
ridiculous
answered
dave
thought
so
that
may
enlighten
the
boy
drew
an
elegant
case
from
his
pocket
selected
a
card
with
a
tissue
paper
cover
and
handed
it
to
dave
who
took
it
somewhat
curious
to
know
the
personality
of
so
presumptuous
an
individual
the
card
read
the
name
brackett
was
suggestive
to
dave
but
not
altogether
enlightening
there
was
a
brackett
who
was
president
of
the
interstate
aero
company
dave
read
the
card
over
twice
closely
and
thoughtfully
then
he
looked
his
visitor
squarely
in
the
face
he
demanded
coolly
name
is
brackett
as
you
probably
observe
remarked
the
boy
smartly
see
it
seem
to
understand
yet
proceeded
the
forward
youth
father
is
the
owner
of
the
company
that
hires
again
challenged
dave
heard
of
him
i
times
replied
dave
young
brackett
looked
nettled
apparently
he
had
expected
dave
to
bow
with
reverence
or
quake
with
fear
here
he
spoke
suddenly
in
a
harsh
rasping
tone
elmer
brackett
my
governor
owns
that
airship
and
everything
around
here
his
son
and
i
want
to
give
my
friend
vernon
a
spin
in
the
said
dave
simply
do
chapter
iv
in
bad
company
that
shouted
young
brackett
he
made
a
spring
forward
as
if
he
hoped
to
intimidate
dave
the
young
aviator
did
not
budge
an
inch
and
his
adversary
contented
himself
with
simply
glaring
at
him
heard
me
said
dave
simply
fired
up
the
fellow
named
vernon
heard
you
and
if
i
was
in
place
you
be
heard
much
longer
say
elmer
why
you
wire
your
father
and
get
some
kind
of
an
accommodating
crowd
around
soon
show
who
was
boss
if
i
was
near
the
old
man
grumbled
young
brackett
am
boss
here
if
that
is
what
you
want
to
call
it
said
dave
is
private
property
i
am
in
charge
and
you
are
trespassers
outside
of
your
not
coming
at
me
in
the
right
way
i
want
to
say
to
you
that
the
is
here
for
a
specific
purpose
and
i
have
my
orders
and
my
father
was
here
soon
order
you
to
give
us
a
spin
in
the
declared
brackett
know
who
your
father
is
and
respect
him
greatly
replied
dave
i
would
have
to
have
his
written
order
to
do
any
work
outside
of
is
that
so
sneered
brackett
seem
to
make
no
bones
about
gallivanting
about
in
the
as
freely
as
you
choose
with
your
own
particular
lady
dave
made
no
reply
he
did
not
consider
that
his
visitors
had
the
fineness
of
mind
to
understand
the
pathetic
circumstances
of
his
efforts
in
behalf
of
the
winston
family
vernon
gave
his
companion
a
wink
and
a
nudge
he
whispered
some
quick
words
to
him
that
dave
did
not
catch
young
brackett
drew
out
a
wallet
stuffed
full
of
money
here
dashaway
he
spoke
in
a
tone
meant
to
be
friendly
and
wheedling
a
good
fellow
there
are
some
girls
down
at
the
hotel
i
promised
to
show
the
to
and
what
she
could
do
on
the
water
make
it
a
twenty
come
help
us
am
sorry
replied
dave
steadily
do
it
again
vernon
whispered
to
his
companion
the
latter
nodded
his
head
vernon
shot
a
quick
glance
about
the
enclosure
then
before
dave
could
surmise
his
purpose
the
man
made
a
spring
at
him
the
young
aviator
was
athletic
and
strong
but
he
had
to
cope
with
a
full
grown
man
vernon
had
seized
his
arms
from
behind
and
dave
struggled
in
vain
those
ropes
over
near
the
airship
directed
vernon
with
an
unpleasant
laugh
show
you
how
to
do
this
young
brackett
looked
a
trifle
frightened
here
vernon
he
said
know
about
i
do
retorted
vernon
securely
twisting
the
rope
about
arms
and
body
said
you
knew
how
to
run
the
machine
you
been
up
in
a
biplane
at
the
works
several
times
said
brackett
rather
hesitatingly
are
you
afraid
of
then
just
because
a
bigger
machine
look
here
give
it
a
are
you
going
to
do
with
dashaway
him
so
if
we
make
any
blunders
have
to
take
the
helm
to
help
himself
out
of
the
want
to
warn
you
cried
dave
are
trying
a
dangerous
vernon
only
laughed
brackett
put
on
a
braggart
air
of
the
former
lifted
dave
into
one
of
the
seats
and
took
his
own
behind
the
pilot
post
right
announced
brackett
climbing
into
the
forward
seat
think
i
can
manage
the
dave
cast
a
hopeless
look
towards
the
gates
of
the
enclosure
there
was
no
sign
of
grimshaw
or
hiram
he
watched
the
bungling
of
brackett
over
the
delicate
mechanism
fearful
as
to
the
outcome
of
the
resolution
of
the
reckless
fellow
eh
he
heard
the
presumptuous
pilot
say
know
how
to
operate
that
this
little
mirror
for
oh
yes
to
index
the
curves
pshaw
i
go
wrong
if
i
watch
you
oh
my
muttered
dave
young
brackett
was
all
right
at
the
wheel
his
brief
biplane
experience
counted
for
enough
to
enable
him
to
make
a
very
pretty
swoop
aloft
he
was
so
delighted
at
this
that
he
chuckled
i
guess
take
a
job
at
running
the
machine
myself
hey
what
for
finely
commended
vernon
over
the
lake
brackett
if
you
can
manage
to
sail
the
machine
take
the
girls
for
a
dave
held
his
breath
brackett
had
split
half
a
circle
abruptly
and
the
got
ready
for
a
dive
by
some
accident
the
frightened
pilot
banked
just
in
time
to
save
a
spill
change
your
dare
to
fairly
shouted
the
excited
dave
as
he
saw
that
any
further
attempt
at
a
head
change
in
novice
hands
meant
sure
destruction
for
the
young
brackett
was
terribly
frightened
in
his
fear
and
dismay
he
turned
on
the
full
power
but
let
the
machine
run
a
perfectly
straight
course
it
was
however
on
an
angle
of
about
fifty
degrees
he
to
do
chattered
vernon
himself
growing
pale
and
nerveless
can
only
show
him
if
the
course
is
not
changed
the
machine
will
hit
the
earth
going
forty
miles
an
hour
declared
dave
him
then
show
him
gasped
vernon
he
reached
over
with
trembling
hands
and
began
to
loosen
the
ropes
with
which
he
had
bound
the
young
aviator
in
some
way
they
had
become
tangled
and
in
that
circumscribed
space
he
dared
not
move
about
freely
the
tipped
slightly
and
its
dismayed
pilot
let
out
a
yell
of
fear
while
vernon
was
tugging
breathlessly
at
the
ropes
dave
noted
that
the
machine
was
due
to
land
with
a
terrific
shock
inside
of
two
minutes
it
just
grazed
the
tops
of
some
tall
trees
then
it
missed
a
flagpole
in
the
center
of
some
private
grounds
off
the
power
or
we
are
lost
cried
dave
brackett
had
just
enough
sense
left
to
obey
him
but
that
did
not
prevent
a
catastrophe
they
were
just
passing
near
some
hothouses
the
first
one
they
skidded
at
the
second
one
the
head
of
the
machine
ripped
the
top
row
of
glasses
out
of
place
like
a
toboggan
shoe
splintering
a
stretch
of
thin
ice
then
the
under
floats
tangled
in
the
frame
work
and
dave
bore
company
with
the
others
in
a
dive
into
a
bed
of
geraniums
the
shock
of
even
that
soft
landing
place
was
sufficient
to
half
stun
our
hero
for
the
moment
in
a
dim
blur
of
vision
he
seemed
to
see
two
figures
limping
away
he
caught
sight
of
the
machine
lying
through
a
frail
trellis
then
he
heard
these
startled
words
in
an
unfamiliar
voice
i
say
this
dave
looked
up
to
see
a
man
in
garb
staring
in
turn
at
himself
the
and
the
havoc
the
machine
had
made
help
me
up
said
dave
rather
faintly
try
to
have
to
cried
the
gardener
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
get
up
but
you
try
to
run
away
from
all
the
mischief
promised
dave
as
the
man
cut
the
ropes
securing
him
badly
is
the
machine
damaged
badly
are
my
greenhouses
damaged
better
say
shouted
the
man
to
pay
for
all
this
wreck
and
ruin
worry
about
that
replied
dave
company
will
settle
with
know
anything
about
your
company
retorted
the
man
heard
of
you
and
you
look
like
a
decent
honest
fellow
but
say
this
is
an
awful
fix
for
me
only
in
charge
here
and
i
know
but
the
boss
will
hold
me
responsible
for
happened
and
take
the
damage
out
of
my
small
will
see
that
he
do
that
pledged
dave
the
man
was
almost
crying
in
his
fright
and
distress
estimate
what
it
will
cost
to
replace
things
as
they
were
directed
dave
settle
it
right
out
of
my
own
pocket
before
i
even
leave
will
cried
the
gardener
joyfully
can
depend
upon
it
did
you
see
anything
of
two
fellows
who
were
in
the
machine
with
me
i
saw
two
young
men
running
for
that
back
fence
yonder
they
got
out
of
sight
pretty
glad
they
hurt
anyway
thought
dave
the
gardener
went
around
surveying
the
damage
done
to
the
greenhouses
while
dave
examined
the
our
hero
was
agreeably
surprised
to
find
that
outside
of
the
warping
of
one
of
the
wings
and
a
twisted
propeller
the
machine
had
suffered
very
slight
injury
lucky
escape
he
said
to
himself
venturesome
fellows
were
never
nearer
death
than
fifteen
minutes
say
this
dashaway
it
was
grimshaw
who
spoke
pale
and
out
of
breath
equally
startled
and
anxious
hiram
dobbs
following
him
came
rushing
up
to
the
spot
chapter
v
right
say
dave
happened
anyway
burst
out
the
irrepressible
hiram
see
observed
dave
with
a
sweeping
wave
of
his
hand
i
see
said
grimshaw
you
never
ran
the
into
all
this
i
the
pilot
on
this
occasion
admitted
dave
told
you
so
cried
hiram
jubilantly
we
first
saw
the
airship
and
its
queer
doings
and
ran
after
it
i
tell
you
that
dave
be
at
the
wheel
grimshaw
did
and
i
felt
sure
he
commented
grimshaw
was
he
challenged
bluntly
quite
a
story
explained
dave
tell
want
much
said
about
it
for
the
present
stipulated
the
young
aviator
right
nodded
grimshaw
dave
motioned
his
friends
out
of
earshot
of
the
gardener
who
was
pottering
about
his
broken
panes
then
he
told
the
whole
story
the
wretches
growled
old
grimshaw
fiercely
when
the
narrative
was
concluded
mean
sneaks
exclaimed
the
indignant
hiram
you
here
in
that
fix
not
knowing
whether
you
were
dead
or
have
those
two
rascals
locked
up
advised
grimshaw
dissented
dave
not
want
to
think
things
over
a
bit
before
i
decide
on
what
i
shall
do
was
the
reply
have
no
patience
with
the
fellow
called
my
word
for
it
a
bad
one
declared
grimshaw
other
feel
sorry
course
you
do
observed
grimshaw
rather
sarcastically
your
usual
way
going
to
pay
for
the
damage
here
say
you
take
my
those
two
smart
alecks
a
lesson
by
having
them
arrested
and
send
the
bill
to
brackett
telling
him
all
the
a
good
deal
rather
help
young
brackett
than
harm
him
said
dave
considerately
strike
me
as
a
bad
fellow
at
heart
the
influence
of
vernon
that
is
leading
him
into
the
machine
in
very
bad
shape
i
think
there
are
enough
tools
and
materials
aboard
to
mend
her
up
till
we
get
all
three
of
them
looked
the
over
critically
expert
that
he
was
old
grimshaw
soon
had
the
machine
free
of
the
trellis
and
the
injured
parts
repaired
dave
went
over
to
the
gardener
who
was
figuring
on
the
side
of
a
fence
post
with
a
piece
of
chalk
my
friend
he
said
cheerily
the
damage
acting
so
handsomely
about
it
i
want
to
make
the
bill
as
reasonable
as
i
can
was
the
reply
course
you
the
right
frames
much
broken
explained
the
man
all
there
is
to
do
is
to
replace
the
but
a
heap
of
it
said
dave
buy
the
panes
by
the
gross
willing
to
do
the
setting
and
puttying
myself
i
think
twenty
dollars
will
cover
dave
took
out
his
pocket
book
selected
some
bank
bills
and
handed
them
to
the
man
he
heard
an
ominous
growl
from
old
grimshaw
behind
him
and
caught
a
from
the
exasperated
hiram
dave
however
had
his
own
ideas
as
to
disposing
of
the
matter
in
hand
you
find
more
you
know
where
to
see
me
said
dave
to
the
gardener
an
easy
one
observed
grimshaw
with
a
look
of
disgust
on
his
face
a
shame
to
let
those
vandals
go
scot
free
scolded
hiram
glad
the
get
smashed
up
as
i
feared
was
all
the
young
aviator
would
reply
dave
made
pretty
sure
that
the
machine
would
stand
a
trip
back
to
the
enclosure
to
his
satisfaction
he
made
the
flight
without
any
mishap
looking
the
craft
over
more
critically
after
the
return
however
he
decided
that
the
wings
and
floats
would
need
some
expert
attention
before
he
could
venture
any
extended
flight
it
was
dark
by
the
time
they
got
the
airship
housed
and
supper
ready
in
the
living
tent
after
the
meal
hiram
strolled
away
saying
he
would
go
to
town
after
the
evening
mail
dave
and
grimshaw
went
inside
the
tent
as
a
shower
came
up
they
chatted
agreeably
watching
the
gentle
rain
in
the
glint
of
the
tent
light
said
the
old
man
bending
his
ear
sharply
nodded
dave
one
is
knocking
at
the
go
and
see
who
it
got
a
grimshaw
went
away
dave
heard
him
talking
with
someone
outside
the
gate
he
was
a
little
surprised
as
his
old
friend
secured
the
gate
after
him
he
was
further
puzzled
to
note
the
expression
on
face
as
he
came
back
into
the
tent
was
it
grimshaw
questioned
dave
he
get
in
now
see
here
you
take
my
advice
and
run
into
another
trap
what
i
said
a
fellow
out
there
that
wants
to
see
you
mighty
meek
and
humble
but
from
what
you
told
me
i
guess
pretty
straight
that
the
chap
who
tried
to
run
the
this
he
alone
asked
dave
rising
quickly
from
the
camp
stool
alone
if
the
bigger
fellow
had
been
with
him
have
licked
he
wants
to
see
me
questioned
dave
mouthed
and
subdued
just
you
invite
him
in
i
say
dave
dashaway
stormed
the
old
man
believe
in
forgiving
dispositions
but
drat
me
if
quite
let
a
like
that
young
brackett
get
a
second
chance
to
mix
things
hardly
think
he
means
any
harm
this
time
said
dave
and
hurried
to
the
gate
outside
a
patch
of
sticking
plaster
over
one
eye
and
one
arm
in
a
sling
and
looking
rather
mean
and
ashamed
young
brackett
dropped
his
glance
as
dave
appeared
in
you
invited
the
young
aviator
quite
heartily
i
think
better
replied
his
visitor
in
a
low
tone
here
dashaway
got
my
senses
back
and
i
want
you
or
anybody
else
to
think
some
cheap
not
responded
dave
the
trouble
come
to
give
you
this
money
explained
brackett
extending
his
hand
soon
as
i
got
enough
over
being
scared
to
feel
ashamed
of
myself
i
slipped
away
from
that
confounded
vernon
always
getting
me
into
do
you
run
with
him
for
then
questioned
dave
gently
here
he
added
placing
his
hand
in
a
friendly
way
on
the
shoulder
may
be
headstrong
and
foolish
at
times
but
that
man
belong
in
your
just
right
began
brackett
in
a
spirited
way
and
then
as
if
he
feared
to
go
farther
into
the
subject
he
added
in
a
moody
dissatisfied
tone
mind
about
that
come
to
pay
you
back
the
twenty
dollars
you
gave
to
the
man
down
at
the
greenhouses
i
went
to
pay
him
myself
but
you
had
gotten
ahead
of
me
i
let
you
stand
for
one
cent
of
damage
i
did
and
if
any
other
at
all
dave
hastened
to
say
here
shown
me
you
are
the
right
sort
i
like
that
man
vernon
and
down
at
heart
i
think
you
do
matter
whether
i
do
or
not
muttered
the
boy
dare
to
break
away
from
him
feel
safe
out
of
his
you
are
in
any
foolish
began
dave
discuss
it
declared
young
brackett
quite
stormily
the
money
here
dashaway
give
worlds
to
keep
this
from
the
old
mean
your
father
you
say
so
then
upbraided
dave
young
brackett
bit
his
lip
try
to
after
this
he
promised
quite
humbly
all
he
added
as
dave
took
the
bank
notes
do
wish
make
a
friend
of
me
and
let
me
help
you
out
if
it
will
do
any
good
said
dave
wistfully
brackett
dropped
his
head
then
he
gave
it
a
savage
jerk
all
right
dashaway
he
said
got
to
pay
for
my
fast
sledding
and
do
it
like
a
and
see
me
again
invited
dave
responded
brackett
paths
probably
cross
probably
the
gainer
for
know
that
declared
dave
easy
on
one
shall
not
say
anything
to
your
father
about
you
i
wish
you
would
tell
him
come
your
best
friend
if
been
a
little
wild
go
to
him
and
tell
him
about
little
wild
repeated
brackett
then
he
gave
a
bitter
laugh
waved
his
hand
at
dave
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
fellow
said
dave
thoughtfully
afraid
as
he
hinted
he
is
in
the
clutches
of
that
sharper
vernon
i
wish
i
knew
a
way
to
help
him
dave
the
enclosure
a
good
deal
subdued
young
brackett
had
said
that
their
paths
might
never
cross
again
dave
hoped
if
they
ever
did
cross
his
late
visitor
would
be
in
a
better
frame
of
mind
their
paths
were
to
cross
indeed
although
neither
of
them
realized
it
at
that
moment
dave
dashaway
was
to
hear
of
him
again
very
soon
and
in
a
truly
remarkable
way
chapter
vi
a
mysterious
flash
what
did
he
want
challenged
grimshaw
gruffly
as
the
young
aviator
entered
the
living
tent
was
young
brackett
said
dave
came
to
settle
the
damage
up
at
the
real
money
surprise
me
observed
the
old
man
drily
be
too
hard
on
him
grimshaw
said
dave
is
some
good
in
all
under
the
surface
then
you
are
too
dashaway
of
a
piece
with
that
jerry
dawson
affair
after
he
and
his
crowd
had
done
you
all
kinds
of
harm
stolen
the
and
tried
to
put
you
out
of
business
you
let
him
go
scot
jerry
had
learned
his
lesson
and
would
behave
he
affirmed
the
old
man
strenuously
wager
pop
up
in
some
mean
way
before
you
get
through
with
this
giant
airship
hiram
announced
dave
brightly
as
the
gate
slammed
and
a
cheery
whistle
echoed
through
the
enclosure
loyal
young
assistant
came
into
the
tent
flushed
and
animated
from
a
run
in
the
rain
mail
inquired
dave
a
letter
and
a
telegram
replied
hiram
handing
two
envelopes
to
dave
the
young
aviator
opened
the
telegram
first
he
looked
at
its
enclosure
so
long
and
steadily
that
his
two
friends
began
to
regard
him
with
deep
curiosity
queer
said
dave
at
length
is
challenged
hiram
is
it
from
interstate
does
it
say
asked
hiram
read
it
it
observed
grimshaw
sort
of
puzzling
now
what
does
it
mean
dave
shook
his
head
vaguely
really
know
he
admitted
hiram
began
to
grin
then
he
laughed
outright
you
demanded
dave
glancing
suspiciously
at
his
friend
hiram
slapped
his
knee
emphatically
chuckling
the
while
he
began
feeling
in
the
outside
pockets
of
his
coat
know
at
first
he
spoke
i
think
i
can
guess
it
out
hiram
drew
out
a
folded
newspaper
opened
it
up
glanced
over
it
and
refolded
it
so
as
to
show
a
article
with
a
display
head
evening
paper
that
just
came
down
with
the
mail
he
explained
at
that
dave
dashaway
and
say
you
famous
our
hero
was
a
good
deal
surprised
to
find
in
the
newspaper
a
glowing
article
about
the
unselfish
heroism
of
a
rising
young
aviator
who
had
encountered
vivid
danger
in
doing
a
noble
service
for
a
poor
girl
dave
saw
at
once
that
the
enterprising
newspaper
man
at
easton
had
made
a
fine
story
of
the
sensational
episode
the
was
lauded
for
its
handsome
conduct
in
a
storm
and
the
interstate
aero
company
was
commended
for
building
such
a
staunch
aircraft
dave
was
given
full
justice
and
the
interesting
little
story
was
told
in
a
very
pathetic
way
understand
now
i
reckon
dave
chuckled
hiram
in
a
way
suppose
the
story
has
been
telegraphed
all
over
the
country
said
hiram
a
good
one
the
interstate
people
saw
it
and
wired
you
at
old
grimshaw
read
the
newspaper
article
eagerly
in
his
turn
he
gloated
over
the
handsome
things
said
about
dave
proud
of
you
as
usual
dashaway
he
observed
dave
opened
the
letter
hiram
had
brought
him
he
read
it
through
with
a
face
indicating
considerable
satisfaction
a
pleasant
bit
of
news
he
announced
to
his
two
friends

it
inquired
hiram
noticed
the
handwriting
and
the
replied
dave
interesting
about
the
giant
airship
whole
lot
answered
dave
briskly

that
dale
has
been
fortunate
enough
to
find
a
french
aero
man
who
spent
several
years
in
foreign
dirigible
service
king
writes
that
he
is
something
of
an
inventor
and
a
practical
man

grimshaw
with
enthusiasm

to
push
the
big
craft
towards

just
as
fast
as
they
can

dave
king
writes
that
they
need
me
and
that
he
is
financing
the
project
on
my
account
he
wants
me
to
get
the
interstate

the
delighted
lad

grimshaw
a
flicker
of
the
old
professional
fire
and
ardor
in
his
eyes
i
got
knocked
out
of
service
by
my
bad
fall

the
biggest
aero
exploit

said
dave
king
settled
that
in
my
last
talk

dirigible
better
than
he
does
a
pretty
well
posted
on
balloons
yes
asserted
the
veteran
aeronaut
with
a
look
of
considerable
pride
there
was
little
else
talked
of
by
the
friends
but
the
giant
airship
the
rest
of
that
evening
dave
later
devoted
an
hour
to
writing
a
long
letter
to
the
interstate
people
he
told
them
that
king
needed
him
and
hoped
they
could
find
it
convenient
to
release
him
without
delay
from
his
contract
like
the
real
business
boy
and
faithful
employe
that
he
was
however
dave
went
through
regular
routine
duty
the
next
day
the
agent
of
the
company
brought
down
his
clients
that
afternoon
and
dave
showed
off
the
at
her
best
paces
the
ensuing
day
and
the
one
next
following
he
made
the
regular
ascents
for
the
resort
people
the
expected
reply
to
letter
finally
arrived
the
interstate
people
wrote
that
they
were
sorry
to
lose
so
valued
an
employe
and
added
a
pleasant
word
concerning
grimshaw
and
hiram
they
hoped
that
the
giant
airship
exploit
would
be
a
great
success
and
announced
that
at
any
time
a
good
position
for
dave
was
open
with
them
a
liberal
check
was
enclosed
in
the
letter
and
the
statement
made
that
a
man
to
take
charge
of
the
would
leave
the
works
for
lake
linden
the
next
day
dave
looked
around
for
young
brackett
whenever
he
strolled
about
the
lake
resort
and
the
village
he
did
not
however
come
across
either
the
youth
or
the
man
vernon
he
made
some
inquiries
and
was
troubled
to
learn
that
the
pair
had
gotten
into
a
fight
at
the
town
hotel
had
smashed
up
some
furniture
and
had
left
the
place
with
a
pretty
bad
record
dave
gave
a
day
to
his
successor
teaching
him
the
ropes
monday
afternoon
he
had
everything
packed
up
ready
to
take
the
train
for
croydon
where
the
giant
airship
was
under
construction
hiram
who
had
been
earning
very
good
wages
of
late
had
ordered
a
new
suit
of
clothes
in
the
village
it
would
not
be
done
until
the
next
morning
go
ahead
dashaway
advised
grimshaw
nothing
to
keep
you
here
and
king
seems
to
need
you
hiram
and
i
will
come
on
this
arrangement
was
agreed
on
dave
took
the
train
and
reached
croydon
about
dusk
he
found
it
to
be
a
busy
little
manufacturing
city
near
the
coast
from
what
king
had
written
him
and
through
some
inquiries
dave
was
soon
on
his
way
to
the
aerodrome
where
the
giant
airship
was
being
built
an
old
roofless
molding
shop
had
been
utilized
for
the
construction
it
looked
lonely
and
deserted
as
dave
came
up
to
it
the
windows
were
boarded
up
apparently
to
keep
out
prying
eyes
the
big
front
doors
were
closely
padlocked
and
a
temporary
canvas
roof
was
in
place
the
street
lamps
of
the
city
ran
out
to
the
factory
and
nearby
were
some
houses
dave
felt
sure
that
king
and
the
others
had
taken
living
quarters
in
the
vicinity
he
had
no
doubt
that
a
little
inquiry
would
result
in
locating
them
dave
walked
around
the
old
plant
thinking
a
good
deal
of
the
proud
hopes
that
attached
to
the
big
airship
inside
the
upper
pair
of
windows
of
the
place
were
not
boarded
up
eyes
chanced
to
be
scanning
these
as
he
was
about
to
cross
the
street
to
where
the
houses
were
he
cried
out
sharply
in
a
startled
way
a
sudden
flash
bright
and
dazzling
shot
across
the
whole
row
of
windows
from
the
interior
of
the
building
it
resembled
the
illumination
made
by
a
sudden
powder
blast
but
there
was
no
report
what
can
that
be
exclaimed
the
bewildered
young
aviator
dave
bent
his
ear
and
listened
no
sound
broke
the
stillness
he
could
not
figure
out
the
circumstances
for
the
moment
he
was
puzzled
and
yet
reluctant
to
leave
the
spot
without
learning
what
the
mysterious
flash
portended
spoke
dave
suddenly
then
he
broke
into
a
run
mystery
had
become
suspicion
against
the
light
of
a
corner
lamp
he
saw
away
down
the
length
of
the
building
the
outlines
of
a
ladder
its
top
rested
on
the
sill
of
one
of
the
upper
windows
the
window
was
open
through
the
aperture
a
form
had
quickly
scrambled
dave
felt
sure
that
some
underhand
work
was
in
progress
there
who
are
you
what
are
you
up
to
he
shouted
as
he
challenged
dave
ran
towards
the
ladder
the
person
descending
it
hurried
his
progress
leaped
from
it
cast
a
hurried
look
at
the
approaching
youth
and
darted
across
the
street
our
hero
noticed
that
he
held
in
one
hand
a
small
black
case
about
ten
inches
square
as
the
fugitive
turned
the
street
corner
he
looked
again
to
see
how
closely
he
was
being
pursued
the
lamp
light
fell
full
upon
his
face
mischief
fairly
shouted
the
amazed
young
aviator
jerry
dawson
chapter
vii
at
the
aerodrome
dave
dashaway
was
greatly
startled
all
along
the
line
of
his
airship
experience
jerry
dawson
had
crossed
his
path
always
in
a
threatening
and
troublesome
way
a
quick
thinker
the
young
aviator
traced
a
new
menace
in
this
unexpected
appearance
of
the
scampish
plotter
certainly
means
no
good
for
either
my
friends
or
myself
reflected
our
hero
mischief
has
he
been
up
to
inside
the
aerodrome
that
flash
meant
something
what
dave
ran
on
for
a
bit
but
soon
discovered
that
he
was
wasting
time
in
striving
to
overtake
the
fugitive
jerry
had
made
good
his
escape
among
the
scattered
buildings
beyond
the
street
corner
where
he
had
disappeared
from
view
dave
hurried
to
the
house
nearest
to
the
aerodrome
he
ran
up
its
steps
and
knocked
briskly
at
its
door
a
woman
appeared
in
response
to
the
summons
am
looking
for
the
people
working
in
the
old
factory
over
yonder
explained
dave
hurriedly
yes
the
balloon
folks
you
mean
they
board
at
my
where
is
that
house
from
the
next
corner
number
you
said
dave
and
was
off
like
a
flash
king
he
called
out
a
moment
later
as
he
recognized
the
figure
of
the
veteran
airman
crossing
the
street
just
ahead
of
him
dashaway
exclaimed
king
in
a
hearty
way
been
expecting
you
and
glad
come
grimshaw
and
tell
you
later
interrupted
dave
rather
unceremoniously
king
get
right
over
to
the
aerodrome
what
do
you
mean
dashaway
is
brewing
if
not
in
what
way
the
young
airman
lost
no
time
in
briefly
recounting
his
discovery
he
had
king
as
thoroughly
stirred
up
as
himself
by
the
time
he
had
concluded
his
graphic
recital
is
serious
declared
king
very
much
disturbed
again
eh
easy
to
guess
trouble
when
that
young
scapegrace
is
around
it
fits
in
that
will
keep
there
is
no
time
to
wait
stay
here
for
a
the
expert
aviator
dashed
into
the
house
while
dave
waited
in
the
street
he
kept
his
eye
fixed
on
the
aerodrome
half
expecting
every
moment
to
see
it
burst
into
flames
we
are
announced
king
reappearing
on
a
run
with
two
companions
one
of
them
was
dale
who
grasped
hand
while
hurrying
along
the
other
man
dave
had
never
seen
before
is
leblance
our
new
man
explained
dale
delay
called
out
king
excitedly
leading
the
way
and
the
group
reached
the
entrance
to
the
aerodrome
in
less
than
two
minutes
king
unlocked
the
door
as
he
opened
it
he
reached
in
and
touched
the
button
controlling
the
electric
lights
a
blaze
of
radiance
suddenly
illuminated
the
rambling
place
making
it
as
bright
as
day
in
the
center
of
the
shop
supported
on
a
working
frame
and
by
the
iron
girders
aloft
was
the
skeleton
of
the
giant
airship
the
young
aviator
was
eagerly
ready
for
full
attention
to
the
object
so
dear
to
him
all
his
faculties
however
were
for
the
instant
enlisted
in
an
effort
to
trace
out
the
significance
of
the
surreptitious
visit
of
jerry
dawson
does
not
seem
to
be
anything
out
of
place
said
king
after
a
swift
survey
of
the
dirigible
balloon
but
i
smell
powder
observed
leblance
sniffing
repeated
dale
there
has
been
some
kind
of
an
explosion
here
insisted
the
french
engineer
looking
around
dave
hurried
over
to
the
window
where
he
had
first
discovered
jerry
dawson
there
were
a
number
of
tall
slim
ladders
all
about
the
working
framework
he
lifted
one
of
these
against
the
sill
of
the
window
aloft
then
he
ran
up
its
rounds
nimbly
suddenly
exclaimed
the
young
aviator
something
dashaway
called
out
king
is
it
for
reply
dave
quickly
descended
the
ladder
he
held
in
one
hand
a
sooted
tin
disc
its
center
showed
a
little
heap
of
hard
cinders
found
this
on
the
window
sill
he
explained
is
it
questioned
dale
think
i
guess
the
motive
of
jerry
visit
now
said
dave
little
black
box
he
had
under
his
arm
was
a
camera
this
is
the
flashlight
exclaimed
king
comprehendingly
have
been
photographing
our
balloon
cried
leblance
asserted
the
young
aviator
the
engineer
and
dale
exchanged
disturbed
looks
king
was
thoughtful
might
have
expected
it
he
said
but
to
dave
only
is
that
inquired
our
hero
tell
you
soon
as
we
reach
the
house
i
am
glad
they
did
no
harm
to
the
balloon
i
hardly
think
they
will
try
that
leblance
he
said
to
the
frenchman
you
had
better
get
one
of
your
men
to
stay
on
watch
here
yes
responded
leblance
earnestly
have
been
warned
we
must
look
with
me
dashaway
said
king
have
a
lot
to
talk
over
with
dale
remained
at
the
aerodrome
until
leblance
could
hunt
up
one
of
his
workmen
and
place
him
on
duty
the
aviator
led
his
young
friend
to
the
boarding
house
dave
declared
that
he
was
not
hungry
but
his
host
would
not
consent
to
this
impending
talk
until
he
had
dispatched
a
good
meal
then
he
took
him
to
his
own
room
locked
the
door
to
secure
them
from
interruption
and
made
him
take
a
comfortable
armchair
have
arrived
in
the
nick
of
time
dashaway
said
king
felt
the
need
of
you
for
some
be
of
much
assistance
until
the
airship
is
finished
i
should
think
suggested
the
young
aviator
is
true
so
far
as
the
is
concerned
agreed
king
end
of
the
proposition
is
in
capable
hands
i
am
glad
to
say
we
have
been
very
fortunate
in
securing
the
services
of
leblance
he
is
an
expert
in
airship
construction
helped
to
build
several
models
in
europe
and
has
some
splendid
new
ideas
i
am
now
satisfied
that
the
will
be
all
that
we
have
hoped
is
good
said
dave
seems
that
our
project
has
made
quite
a
stir
in
the
aviation
world
proceeded
king
the
clubs
are
interested
the
central
association
has
taken
the
matter
up
and
there
is
a
chance
of
a
bulk
prize
of
at
least
fifty
thousand
dollars
being
commented
dave
with
sparkling
eyes
worth
trying
for
it
king
we
will
get
it
if
no
miss
in
our
no
trickery
dashaway
asserted
the
veteran
airman
confidently
have
counted
all
the
risks
and
chances
given
fair
conditions
i
believe
our
group
will
successfully
make
the
first
airship
voyage
across
the
atlantic
i
will
show
you
how
far
we
have
progressed
and
how
carefully
leblance
is
planning
to
turn
out
the
finest
dirigible
ever
constructed
it
will
make
you
as
hopeful
and
enthusiastic
as
that
already
insisted
the
young
aviator
good
but
i
need
your
services
for
a
certain
phase
of
the
proposition
that
is
worrying
is
that
king
dashaway
answered
the
expert
airman
have
reason
to
believe
that
we
will
not
be
the
only
contestant
in
a
race
across
the
atlantic
in
fact
continued
king
seriously
am
quite
certain
that
the
rival
of
the
is
being
built
chapter
viii
the
rival
airship
rival
in
the
field
said
the
young
aviator
with
a
good
deal
of
interest
and
curiosity
nodded
king
that
i
expect
it
we
have
no
exclusive
patent
on
building
an
airship
and
trying
to
cross
the
atlantic
we
do
want
to
know
what
we
have
to
fight
against
it
is
always
best
to
find
out
what
your
competitors
are
doing
agreed
dave
there
are
several
we
have
run
down
and
dismissed
from
our
minds
of
them
are
cranks
seeking
notoriety
some
of
the
others
are
inventors
who
know
all
about
mechanics
but
nothing
practical
concerning
aircraft
it
would
amuse
you
to
go
over
some
of
the
wild
schemes
they
are
getting
up
one
proposition
has
kept
me
busy
is
that
king
remember
a
man
named
davidson
certainly
responded
the
young
aviator
at
once
is
the
fellow
they
ran
out
of
the
springfield
aero
the
man
assented
king
unscrupulous
trickster
he
has
been
tabooed
by
all
legitimate
airmen
but
he
has
bobbed
up
again
with
his
nerve
and
audacity
look
the
aviator
selected
a
bunch
of
newspaper
clippings
from
a
drawer
in
his
desk
and
pushed
them
over
to
his
young
friend
dave
scanned
them
rapidly
an
item
hinted
mysteriously
at
a
grand
exploit
in
aeronautics
about
to
be
undertaken
by
the
airman
roger
davidson
a
later
article
purported
to
show
the
possibility
of
sailing
a
dirigible
balloon
across
the
atlantic
a
column
story
followed
it
referred
to
the
great
interest
in
the
international
exploit
and
named
the
rich
prize
ready
for
the
successful
competitor
it
was
understood
that
roger
davidson
was
preparing
to
enter
the
race
and
a
superb
aircraft
was
being
built
for
him
at
an
aero
plant
at
senca
suppose
you
remember
that
jerry
dawson
and
his
father
were
in
the
employ
of
davidson
for
a
time
king
observed
dave
recall
it
perfectly
nodded
the
aviator
jerry
being
here
shows
they
are
together
looks
that
way
as
long
as
they
only
try
to
steal
our
thunder
i
so
much
mind
remarked
the
airman
may
be
the
start
for
something
worse
you
see
i
am
tied
up
here
with
leblance
i
want
you
to
ferret
out
the
davidson
crowd
and
find
if
they
are
really
up
to
can
do
that
assured
the
young
aviator
confidently
better
i
know
get
their
dashaway
find
out
if
they
are
really
in
earnest
or
only
jockeying
for
notoriety
or
fleecing
some
gullible
right
agreed
dave
and
that
settled
it
with
king
who
had
full
confidence
in
the
shrewd
wits
and
fidelity
of
the
boy
he
had
taught
to
fly
dave
was
to
start
for
senca
the
next
evening
he
passed
a
glorious
morning
at
the
aerodrome
the
french
inventor
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
men
he
had
ever
met
leblance
was
all
business
but
very
enthusiastic
and
optimistic
in
his
work
he
took
a
fancy
to
dave
and
told
him
things
about
transatlantic
aircraft
and
airmen
that
were
part
of
an
actual
education
to
the
young
aspirant
for
aeronautic
honors
the
construction
of
the
had
progressed
far
enough
to
show
a
practical
form
and
substance
no
expense
was
being
spared
the
men
under
leblance
were
experts
in
their
line
and
dave
was
amazed
at
the
details
they
were
working
out
money
well
invested
declared
dale
it
only
serves
to
produce
the
most
perfect
airship
ever
if
they
put
all
the
things
in
the
they
count
on
said
dave
will
be
like
a
trip
on
a
ocean
steamship
till
done
my
friend
observed
leblance
shall
we
shall
cross
the
atlantic
oh
never
grimshaw
and
hiram
put
in
an
appearance
by
noon
the
latter
went
wild
over
the
he
believed
implicitly
in
dave
and
the
young
aviator
believed
in
the
giant
airship
under
construction
they
let
me
go
on
that
trip
said
hiram
breathlessly
be
the
proudest
and
the
happiest
fellow
in
the
are
going
if
any
of
us
do
promised
king
and
the
delighted
hiram
moved
about
as
if
he
was
treading
on
air
king
went
down
to
the
train
with
dave
run
into
any
danger
dashaway
he
advised
are
going
to
deal
with
a
crowd
remember
shall
remember
promised
dave
profit
by
your
hiram
was
rather
lonesome
over
the
absence
of
his
friend
the
next
day
the
ensuing
one
he
got
restless
and
anxious
tell
you
what
he
said
confidently
to
grimshaw
the
next
afternoon
dave
show
up
soon
going
after
knows
how
to
take
care
of
him
for
that
insisted
the
old
airman
i
stand
this
worry
if
he
come
by
going
to
look
him
grimshaw
said
nothing
to
this
he
was
in
fact
also
a
trifle
disturbed
over
the
prolonged
absence
of
dave
his
grim
face
relaxed
into
genuine
relief
and
gladness
that
evening
as
just
after
dusk
the
young
aviator
broke
in
upon
the
airship
group
dave
was
brisk
and
cheery
as
usual
and
all
hands
gave
him
a
cordial
greeting
king
and
leblance
were
eager
to
hear
his
report
at
once
said
dave
found
out
about
all
there
is
to
discover
down
at
it
amount
to
anything
inquired
the
aviator
for
you
and
leblance
to
across
that
fine
specimen
of
humanity
young
dawson
asked
grimshaw
in
a
kind
of
a
growl
had
been
sent
to
new
york
for
some
balloon
material
explained
dave
i
got
along
finely
for
davidson
know
me
by
sight
sure
enough
they
are
building
a
dirigible
balloon
continued
dave
found
a
backer
who
has
put
up
several
thousand
dollars
they
talk
big
of
how
sure
they
are
of
reaching
liverpool
in
a
time
and
dave
smiled
are
you
smiling
at
dashaway
inquired
king
would
smile
if
you
saw
the
craft
they
are
building
declared
dave
tell
you
the
truth
i
get
away
from
the
suspicion
that
the
whole
thing
is
what
people
call
a
do
you
mean
i
had
no
trouble
in
getting
into
their
workroom
the
way
they
act
the
machine
getting
i
almost
made
up
my
mind
that
davidson
is
doing
all
this
to
get
some
of
the
easy
money
if
the
ever
sails
a
hundred
miles
let
alone
a
thousand
it
will
be
doing
kind
of
a
craft
is
this
inquired
leblance
with
professional
interest
show
you
said
dave
feeling
in
his
pocket
fact
is
i
gave
those
fellows
tit
for
how
questioned
the
curious
hiram
they
stole
a
photograph
of
the
i
had
the
chance
to
draw
a
picture
of
the
dictator
and
here
it
the
young
aviator
produced
a
paper
roll
from
his
pocket
dave
was
a
natural
draughtsman
as
he
spread
out
the
paper
a
penciled
outline
was
revealed
me
see
it
spoke
leblance
eagerly
you
have
done
the
keen
eyes
of
the
french
inventor
scanned
the
drawing
intently
then
suddenly
and
with
great
excitement
of
manner
he
threw
it
upon
the
table
he
exclaimed
absurd
my
friend
king
we
have
nothing
to
fear
the
is
a
botch
a
farce
whoever
constructed
it
is
a
novice
a
dabbler
that
machine
could
not
fly
ten
miles
chapter
ix
in
the
lead
here
to
see
you
hiram
greeted
the
young
aviator
with
this
announcement
one
evening
two
weeks
after
their
arrival
at
croydon
that
so
said
dave
was
it
say
for
he
tell
his
name
i
was
walking
along
the
fence
around
the
aerodrome
and
just
as
i
neared
the
gates
he
popped
out
from
behind
a
pile
of
boards
just
as
if
he
had
been
in
he
ask
for
me
i
told
him
you
were
here
quite
regularly
and
always
evenings
at
the
boarding
house
the
fellow
looked
peaked
and
scared
and
backed
away
as
soon
as
he
saw
someone
coming
down
the
street
he
mumbled
something
about
finding
the
young
airman
could
not
surmise
who
his
strange
visitor
might
be
he
ransacked
his
mind
wondering
if
it
could
be
some
one
of
his
old
friends
from
his
home
town
then
he
said
him
to
me
hiram
will
you
explained
hiram
was
a
trifle
older
than
i
am
and
taller
yes
fully
two
inches
taller
oh
by
the
way
he
wore
a
false
that
challenged
dave
half
guessing
hiram
was
joking
but
the
narrator
looked
earnest
enough
say
he
wore
a
false
mustache
thing
persisted
hiram
did
you
know
it
was
false
it
came
partly
off
just
as
the
boy
turned
his
face
away
say
you
tell
much
about
him
his
face
and
hands
were
all
grimed
up
and
he
had
his
cap
pulled
way
down
over
his
eyes
it
was
funny
though
one
hiram
all
his
trampish
looks
i
noticed
that
his
linen
was
fine
and
white
and
the
necktie
he
wore
was
one
of
those
expensive
ones
you
see
in
good
furnishing
that
so
observed
dave
musingly
then
a
quick
thought
came
to
his
mind
he
put
hiram
through
a
rapid
course
of
am
satisfied
it
is
young
brackett
said
dave
to
himself
why
in
that
trim
and
acting
like
a
fugitive
hiram
he
added
aloud
your
eye
out
for
that
boy
i
am
sure
he
is
in
some
kind
of
trouble
and
wishes
to
see
me
very
right
nodded
hiram
carelessly
get
away
from
me
next
use
any
force
and
scare
him
directed
dave
him
that
i
guess
who
he
is
and
want
to
see
him
very
well
professor
leblance
just
going
into
the
aerodrome
it
famous
what
he
says
about
the
being
nearly
finished
and
just
as
perfect
as
money
and
skill
could
make
both
boys
hurried
their
steps
to
overtake
the
genial
accommodating
frenchman
for
the
time
being
recent
visitor
drifted
from
his
mind
the
past
two
weeks
had
been
the
busiest
and
most
engrossing
in
all
the
career
of
the
young
airman
report
on
the
davidson
balloon
and
the
drawing
of
it
he
had
showed
to
leblance
had
convinced
the
expert
that
the
could
not
make
even
a
start
in
the
race
across
the
atlantic
dave
had
told
him
the
gas
bag
of
the
was
conspicuously
made
of
fabric
its
promoter
davidson
had
made
a
great
claim
the
propelling
power
of
the
he
declared
would
be
built
on
the
monoplane
principle
when
traveling
the
gas
bag
would
collapse
except
when
they
wanted
to
float
a
machine
was
among
the
adjuncts
of
the
hull
and
was
placed
just
above
the
framework
attaching
the
airplanes
to
the
balloon
is
nonsense
ridiculous
insisted
leblance
over
and
over
again
are
inviting
sure
death
if
they
venture
a
hundred
miles
away
from
the
same
they
are
going
to
try
it
proclaimed
hiram
a
week
later
holding
up
a
newspaper
is
a
great
account
of
the
machine
and
the
plans
and
davidson
and
jerry
dawson
who
are
going
to
fly
the
these
two
latter
individuals
did
not
trouble
the
people
any
further
a
constant
guard
however
was
kept
on
duty
in
the
aerodrome
there
were
a
great
many
curious
and
interested
visitors
day
by
day
the
giant
airship
approached
completion
now
as
hiram
had
announced
it
was
practically
ready
to
essay
its
initial
flight
professor
leblance
smiled
indulgently
at
them
as
with
considerable
professional
pride
he
walked
around
the
mammoth
structure
his
skill
and
efficiency
had
devised
dave
never
tired
of
surveying
the
splendid
machine
to
him
it
was
a
marvel
how
leblance
had
assembled
the
parts
of
the
airship
so
speedily
there
were
three
engines
and
from
the
wooden
ribs
and
metal
bracing
socketed
to
withstand
collisions
to
the
passenger
cabin
almost
as
sumptuously
furnished
as
a
pullman
palace
car
every
detail
fitted
into
a
mammoth
scheme
never
before
attempted
in
aeronautics
will
do
what
no
aeroplane
could
accomplish
said
leblance
to
his
companions
who
were
admiringly
regarding
the
great
machine
is
that
leblance
inquired
the
young
aviator
can
be
perfectly
handled
in
a
storm
exceeding
miles
an
hour
velocity
it
is
as
much
of
a
ship
as
any
that
can
travel
the
ocean
an
iron
ship
is
sustained
on
the
water
by
the
air
inside
of
her
hull
air
being
eight
hundred
times
lighter
than
water
the
will
be
sustained
in
the
air
by
hydrogen
gas
which
is
sixteen
times
lighter
than
sixteen
to
one
is
as
good
as
unlimited
to
one
remarked
dave
who
had
been
studying
aeronautics
it
the
is
a
ship
sustained
by
displacing
more
than
its
own
weight
on
the
air
its
gas
chambers
are
inflated
to
about
of
their
capacity
to
allow
for
the
full
expansion
of
gas
after
the
ship
has
been
driven
up
dynamically
by
the
action
of
the
engines
and
propellers
the
flat
top
and
under
surface
of
the
hull
acting
as
an
the
was
a
flexible
gas
bag
just
like
the
ordinary
drifting
balloon
except
that
in
shape
it
was
long
and
pointed
instead
of
round
otherwise
leblance
explained
it
could
not
be
driven
through
the
air
the
gas
was
contained
in
separate
chambers
inside
of
the
rigid
hull
which
performed
the
same
functions
as
the
compartments
inside
an
ocean
liner
will
sink
only
if
it
leaks
badly
explained
leblance
sustaining
compartments
are
always
closed
even
if
several
compartments
should
burst
the
loss
of
the
lift
is
compensated
by
the
aeroplane
action
of
the
hull
whenever
driven
at
full
speed
when
thus
driven
it
burns
its
own
fuel
so
rapidly
that
this
acting
the
same
as
the
casting
of
ballast
is
continuously
lightening
the
ship
this
is
what
is
called
balancing
the
ship
the
air
balloonets
maintain
the
rigidity
of
the
bag
whenever
it
loses
gas
through
the
action
of
the
sun
or
change
in
elevation
the
breeze
passing
through
the
ventilators
at
the
bow
prevents
the
gas
from
expanding
on
the
hottest
days
of
the
year
i
tell
you
confidently
my
young
friends
to
my
mind
the
is
practically
neither
dave
nor
hiram
had
thus
far
been
inside
the
cabin
and
other
living
apartments
of
the
they
had
however
watched
their
construction
the
big
airship
could
carry
twenty
passengers
if
necessary
and
in
providing
for
the
comfort
of
those
making
the
first
trip
no
detail
for
their
welfare
had
been
overlooked
there
were
washrooms
provision
apartments
a
galley
and
the
quarters
leblance
explained
would
be
perfect
in
appointment
and
equipment
the
main
point
he
had
striven
for
was
to
maintain
absolute
control
of
the
gas
at
all
times
as
this
depended
upon
reliable
engines
motors
had
been
built
that
ran
for
hours
at
full
speed
the
machinery
could
not
break
down
as
every
part
had
been
duplicated
means
said
leblance
if
the
carburetor
gets
out
of
order
a
duplicate
enables
it
to
go
right
on
working
the
engine
has
a
great
number
of
automatic
devices
among
them
two
pumps
which
force
the
fuel
to
exactly
the
right
places
even
if
the
ship
is
standing
on
its
beam
ends
running
up
into
the
air
or
coming
down
at
an
angle
of
degrees
you
have
to
sit
sandwiched
in
small
quarters
my
young
friends
you
can
walk
up
and
down
the
cabin
and
go
all
over
the
ship
without
disturbing
the
balance
of
the
huge
float
overhead
the
last
touch
will
be
put
on
the
engine
and
then
practically
we
will
be
all
hiram
went
down
to
the
for
the
mail
after
supper
that
day
king
and
his
party
were
downstairs
in
the
living
room
of
the
boarding
house
entertaining
two
airmen
who
had
come
to
croydon
to
look
over
the
that
afternoon
when
hiram
returned
the
young
impetuous
assistant
burst
unceremoniously
in
upon
the
group
stumbled
over
a
rug
and
went
flat
but
flushed
and
breathless
tossed
the
evening
newspaper
to
king
read
panted
the
excited
lad
all
this
commotion
hiram
questioned
the
astonished
veteran
airman
all
paper
gasped
hiram
in
jerks
of
that
fairly
shouted
dale
springing
to
his
feet
declared
hiram
started
from
senca
this
her
trip
across
the
atlantic
chapter
x
the
haunted
aerodrome
the
excitable
leblance
was
on
his
feet
in
an
instant
dave
reached
the
side
of
king
and
glanced
quickly
at
the
paper
he
had
opened
out
poorly
equipped
quickly
almost
shouted
the
frenchman
has
sailed
just
the
same
announced
the
veteran
airman
conclusively
read
it
to
every
word
of
the
article
in
the
newspaper
was
taken
in
absorbedly
by
the
persons
in
the
room
according
to
it
the
had
made
a
splendid
ascent
from
senca
at
two
that
afternoon
the
red
white
and
blue
appearance
of
the
great
gas
bag
had
evoked
the
most
patriotic
enthusiasm
and
cheers
and
had
accompanied
the
flight
the
according
to
the
report
would
float
southward
overland
till
a
point
near
baltimore
was
reached
here
a
descent
would
be
made
to
learn
its
condition
the
machinery
carefully
scanned
and
the
ocean
course
begun
then
followed
an
interview
given
out
by
davidson
on
the
superiority
of
his
double
monoplane
apparatus
there
was
too
a
portrait
of
davidson
and
one
of
jerry
dawson
the
article
wound
up
with
a
reference
to
the
which
it
stated
would
soon
be
hot
on
the
heels
of
the
have
got
the
lead
observed
dale
in
an
anxious
tone
the
one
of
the
group
most
disquieted
by
the
newspaper
article
professor
leblance
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
waved
his
hand
to
express
ridicule
his
long
waxed
mustache
curled
up
in
disdain
is
absurd
he
said
i
not
know
an
egg
shell
like
science
no
reserve
force
bah
i
laugh
at
all
the
same
the
volatile
frenchman
beckoned
king
to
the
next
room
in
low
serious
tones
they
held
quite
an
extended
conversation
at
its
end
leblance
hurried
from
the
house
king
returned
to
his
friends
with
a
serious
face
ball
has
been
set
rolling
he
spoke
is
no
doubt
of
that
no
matter
what
we
think
or
guess
about
the
it
seems
certain
that
the
craft
has
made
a
start
leblance
has
gone
to
set
his
men
at
night
work
the
must
be
gotten
in
trim
for
its
flight
within
quickly
as
that
exclaimed
dave
assures
me
he
will
have
the
all
ready
for
its
flight
by
day
after
said
the
airman
preparations
my
friends
there
must
be
no
whispered
hiram
into
the
ear
of
his
young
friend
the
guests
of
king
saw
that
his
mind
was
seriously
on
his
business
and
arose
to
depart
of
our
crowd
will
be
here
to
give
the
the
right
one
of
them
declared
the
airman
saw
the
visitors
to
the
door
when
he
returned
he
snatched
up
his
hat
quickly
with
me
dashaway
you
too
hiram
he
directed
are
you
going
inquired
dale
the
aerodrome
there
is
going
to
be
a
lot
of
rush
work
to
do
and
perhaps
we
can
me
in
said
the
old
man
cheerily
i
been
very
useful
so
far
outside
of
gaping
at
the
wonderful
work
of
our
gifted
friend
after
is
the
spoke
up
grimshaw
start
for
the
the
group
left
the
boarding
house
they
crossed
the
street
and
walked
along
the
fence
of
the
aerodrome
enclosure
dave
and
hiram
were
in
the
lead
they
were
chatting
animatedly
as
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
building
when
dave
was
thrust
violently
to
the
side
and
hiram
was
knocked
head
over
heels
to
the
street
a
frenzied
yell
accompanied
the
collision
with
them
of
a
wild
scurrying
form
which
recoiled
at
the
unexpected
impact
a
hat
bobbing
from
its
head
all
this
challenged
the
astonished
king
the
night
watchman
declared
grimshaw
king
panted
the
man
and
then
pale
shaking
and
gasping
for
breath
he
fell
against
the
wall
of
the
building
from
sheer
weakness
brace
up
ordered
the
aviator
seizing
the
arms
of
the
fellow
and
shaking
him
the
trouble
choked
out
the
watchman
in
thrilling
accents
do
you
mean
ghost
in
the
aerodrome
questioned
king
derisively
that
what
trying
to
say
here
grimshaw
help
me
get
this
fellow
back
to
his
post
of
between
them
they
forced
the
man
along
the
walk
he
gurgled
quaked
and
held
back
as
they
neared
the
gates
of
the
enclosure
they
found
these
locked
as
also
the
door
to
the
old
factory
when
they
reached
it
locked
it
in
quavered
the
frightened
watchman
let
it
out
a
fine
guardian
of
property
you
are
censured
the
airman
severely
we
are
and
as
he
opened
the
door
king
snapped
on
the
electric
lights
the
watchman
sank
to
a
chair
and
crouched
as
he
directed
a
scared
glance
around
the
place
your
ghost
derided
the
aviator
quickly
see
him
now
grunted
the
watchman
guess
you
scoffed
grimshaw
must
be
a
weak
one
to
fly
into
a
tantrum
like
this
over
fairly
bellowed
the
watchman
saw
it
plain
as
the
nose
on
my
face
see
here
i
had
the
door
ajar
about
a
foot
to
let
in
a
little
of
the
cool
evening
air
here
i
sat
in
my
chair
right
near
it
i
must
have
half
snoozed
and
woke
up
suddenly
not
five
feet
away
right
near
that
oil
tank
yonder
was
a
horrible
shape
it
was
all
white
and
unearthly
as
i
started
up
it
let
out
an
unearthly
scream
and
waved
its
arms
say
it
was
curdling
i
bolted
for
the
door
locked
it
and
you
scooted
all
right
grumbled
hiram
rubbing
a
bump
on
his
head
king
with
a
glance
of
impatience
at
the
great
booby
of
a
watchman
proceeded
briskly
the
length
of
the
building
peering
into
every
odd
nook
and
corner
when
he
came
back
he
held
in
his
hand
a
long
cotton
sheet
that
had
been
used
to
cover
some
of
the
machinery
is
what
you
saw
he
declared
has
been
playing
a
trick
on
how
could
that
be
chattered
the
watchman
nobody
was
in
the
building
but
me
do
you
know
that
demanded
the
aviator
you
say
you
had
the
door
open
i
tell
you
some
one
slipped
in
wrapped
in
the
sheet
and
half
scared
the
life
out
of
he
must
be
here
now
insisted
the
watchman
when
i
bolted
i
locked
the
door
after
all
looks
rather
queer
remarked
dale
suddenly
shouted
the
watchman
the
matter
now
asked
king
dinner
i
bring
my
night
lunch
about
it
it
was
right
here
near
my
chair
been
dave
had
followed
the
progress
of
the

seated
in
the

room
of

the
words
through
a
tube
at
his
side
connecting
with
the
cabin
dave
dashaway
stood
beside
him
and
behind
the
young
aviator
was
hiram
dobbs
it
was
the
most
impressive
moment
in

start
of
the
giant
airship
on
a
cruise
but
once
before
attempted
by
mortal
man
before
the
skilled
sky
rider
was
a
great
sheet
of
glass
punctured
with
knobs
of
metal
each
bore
a
number
from
practice
these
indices
to
guiding
detail
were
as
familiar
to
king
as
an
alphabet
to
a
schoolboy
the
operator
was
so
intent
upon
his
work
that
his
hand
trembled
his
eyes
were
glued
to
the
pilot
board
and
his
face
was
quite
pale
dave
stood
with
every
nerve
tense
and
strained
hiram
fairly
held
his
breath
there
was
a
grind
and
a
sway
as
king
touched
a
particular
button
the
huge
gas
bag
lifted
its
prow
from
the
ground
then
its
body
cleared
all
earth
of
contact
and
the
next
instant
was
stretched
out
on
an
angle
of
degrees
started
breathed
dave
grand
pronounced
hiram
in
a
gasp
both
edged
towards
the
open
window
a
dizzying
panorama
greeted
their
sight
the
old
factory
was
a
wreck
one
entire
sidewall
and
parts
of
the
front
and
rear
walls
had
been
torn
out
of
place
that
morning
to
allow
for
the
exit
to
level
ground
of
the
outside
of
the
enclosure
over
a
thousand
persons
were
gathered
a
band
was
playing
the
crowd
was
cheering
and
from
a
neighboring
roof
a
group
of
reporters
and
a
dozen
airmen
friends
of
king
joined
in
the
tumult
waving
hats
flags
and
handkerchiefs
the
behaved
splendidly
there
was
not
a
jar
as
it
ended
a
mile
ascent
in
exactly
five
minutes
then
as
the
vast
machine
balanced
to
its
natural
position
it
began
a
straight
even
glide
so
graceful
and
buoyant
that
it
imparted
a
positive
thrill
to
the
passengers
glorious
burst
out
the
irrepressible
hiram
feel
as
if
i
had
been
taking
laughing
gas
dave
resumed
his
position
near
his
friend
and
patron
king
for
the
present
he
was
to
take
no
active
part
in
running
the
he
had
however
sat
up
half
the
night
listening
to
the
arrangements
mapped
out
by
professor
leblance
he
realized
too
that
as
soon
as
he
learned
all
that
the
aviator
had
acquired
he
was
to
relieve
him
there
was
not
a
movement
made
by
the
skilled
hand
of
the
airman
that
dave
did
not
memorize
he
had
accompanied
the
professor
in
a
tour
all
over
the
craft
two
hours
before
starting
and
had
been
amazed
at
the
simplicity
of
the
construction
as
a
whole
he
was
lost
in
admiration
as
he
realized
what
a
perfect
mechanism
controlled
the
giant
airship
the
frenchman
had
four
skilled
airship
men
under
his
orders
they
had
been
trained
to
their
duties
in
germany
and
france
each
knew
what
was
required
of
him
and
each
understood
that
while
they
appeared
to
act
as
automatons
a
single
miss
in
the
programme
might
end
their
career
in
or
in
the
ocean
depths
outside
of
these
men
who
performed
engineering
duties
solely

young
and
enthusiastic

vacla

the

two
persons
both
foreigners
the
cook
and
the
cabin
attendant

this

in

the
cabin
had
rows
of
windows
on
both
sides
and
was
furnished
comfortably
and
even
elegantly
seated
at
one
of
the
windows
a
passenger
had
a
perfect
view
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
hiram
found
his
way
to
the
cabin
to
come
upon

the
good
hearted
old
gentleman
who
had
financed

almost
solely
on

was
chuckling
with
his
fat
comfortable
face
crossed
with
a
great
smile

more
contented

were
shining
with
excitement

at

reminded
the

is
calm
and
fair
it
is
a
pleasant
beginning
when
we
get
over
the
the
frenchman

shrugged
his

nightfall
we

have
reached
what
we
call
the
approximate

current
the
right
air
course
is
just
as
established
as
the
ocean
roads
and
we
aim
to
follow
it
in
our
now
my
friends
came
from
dale
have
something
more
to
say
about
this
wonderful
all
eyes
were
at
once
turned
on
the
rich
gentleman
who
had
made
it
possible
to
construct
the
ago
dave
father
and
i
were
chums
he
did
me
many
a
good
turn
that
is
why
i
have
taken
such
an
interest
in
my
young
friend
here
now
that
this
giant
airship
is
an
accomplished
fact
i
wish
to
make
it
known
to
all
of
you
that
i
have
had
it
built
on
his
dale
interrupted
our
hero
is
true
my
boy
and
from
this
moment
on
i
wish
the
to
be
known
as
dave
airship
went
on
the
rich
gentleman
cried
hiram
and
grimshaw
in
unison
airship
cried
dave
my
boy
your
airship
answered
dale
may
she
win
her
way
across
the
atlantic
without
a
to
that
put
in
king
my
warmest
congratulations
and
he
held
out
his
hand
dave
was
so
overcome
he
could
scarcely
speak
but
at
last
he
thanked
dale
heartily
for
his
great
kindness
the
thought
that
the
giant
airship
had
been
turned
over
to
him
filled
his
heart
with
new
enthusiasm
do
my
best
to
make
a
success
of
the
trip
he
said
in
a
voice
filled
with
emotion
know
you
bank
on
you
my
boy
answered
dale
they
circled
out
toward
the
water
for
a
few
miles
to
ascertain
the
strength
of
some
of
the
ocean
currents
of
air
and
as
they
were
turning
inward
again
dave
cried
out
a
seagull
trying
to
race
with
us
i
do
believe
he
pointed
upward
and
there
in
the
air
above
them
and
off
to
one
side
was
one
of
the
graceful
birds
what
it
is
exclaimed
dale
that
reminds
me
of
something
i
must
do
to
oblige
a
friend
but
first
let
us
watch
that
all
eyes
were
now
turned
toward
it
the
swift
bird
seemed
to
realize
that
one
of
its
own
kind
or
more
properly
a
rival
was
disputing
the
element
so
long
unconquerable
by
man
the
seagull
would
approach
the
giant
airship
as
if
to
ascertain
what
it
wanted
in
the
upper
regions
to
learn
its
speed
and
power
then
as
if
alarmed
at
the
noise
of
the
propeller
or
perhaps
some
of
the
odors
of
the
escaping
gas
the
bird
would
veer
off
only
to
return
cried
dave
again
going
to
see
how
much
faster
it
can
go
than
we
do
trying
to
double
on
us
i
declare
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
seagull
did
darting
ahead
it
swung
around
a
good
distance
in
front
of
the
airship
and
then
as
if
to
prove
how
puny
was
man
compared
to
nature
the
bird
darted
straight
back
toward
the
craft
going
to
ram
be
killed
sure
yelled
king
going
to
one
side
declared
dale
and
that
is
what
the
bird
did
like
an
arrow
it
shot
along
the
side
of
the
almost
brushing
the
gas
bags
with
its
wing
tips
to
the
rear
swung
the
big
bird
its
purpose
was
now
plain
it
was
going
to
circle
the
airship
can
play
at
that
game
cried
dave
put
on
all
speed
can
we
beat
the
seagull
certainly
can
said
king
in
a
quiet
voice
he
walked
over
to
some
of
the
signal
buttons
and
pushed
them
the
effect
was
at
once
apparent
there
was
an
increased
tremor
through
the
whole
craft
it
darted
ahead
and
cleaved
the
air
as
it
had
never
done
before
once
more
king
pressed
a
small
lever
again
the
trembling
of
the
craft
increased
as
if
she
would
shake
apart
but
she
was
staunchly
built
you
see
the
gull
demanded
dale
here
he
comes
cried
dave
been
to
the
stern
rounded
it
and
here
he
comes
up
alongside
like
the
wind
trying
to
pass
us
he
never
will
spoke
king
goes
for
the
final
test
perhaps
foolish
to
use
our
greatest
speed
on
a
new
motor
before
been
warmed
up
and
run
longer
than
this
has
but
we
might
as
well
know
first
as
last
just
what
the
will
do
now
for
the
test
he
pressed
a
button
that
communicated
with
the
motor
room
and
there
came
such
a
vibration
to
the
craft
that
one
and
all
who
were
not
aware
of
the
reserve
power
looked
at
one
another
in
some
alarm
about
it
dave
inquired
king
we
holding
our
own
yes
eagerly
answered
the
young
aviator
gull
is
straining
every
wing
feather
but
falling
back
look
no
even
with
us
now
going
was
the
after
all
to
be
beaten
the
gull
was
now
flying
alongside
in
such
a
position
as
to
be
visible
to
all
clearly
the
bird
was
exerting
every
last
ounce
of
strength
its
wings
were
wildly
beating
the
air
and
its
slender
head
and
hooked
bill
were
stretched
out
like
the
prow
of
some
the
air
falling
falling
win
cried
dave
exultantly
it
was
so
the
gull
unable
to
keep
up
the
terrific
speed
was
losing
ground
the
airship
kept
on
its
awful
power
forcing
it
forward
foot
by
foot
the
bird
fell
back
until
like
some
express
train
passing
a
slow
freight
the
shot
ahead
of
the
weary
bird
and
the
creature
as
if
humiliated
by
the
test
folded
its
wings
and
dropped
downward
like
a
shot
in
order
to
rest
then
spreading
wide
its
pinions
again
it
floated
in
the
air
far
below
the
rival
craft
sure
did
go
cried
dave
in
triumph
as
some
of
the
terrific
power
was
cut
down
what
was
it
you
said
you
wanted
to
do
that
the
sight
of
the
gull
reminded
you
about
yes
well
nothing
more
or
less
than
to
release
a
carrier
pigeon
i
have
on
carrier
pigeon
cried
several
a
friend
of
mine
who
is
interested
in
aeronautics
and
who
published
a
magazine
about
them
asked
me
to
do
this
for
him
he
gave
me
a
carrier
pigeon
a
few
days
ago
and
requested
me
to
release
it
on
our
trial
trip
i
said
i
would
and
now
i
am
going
to
send
him
a
message
of
our
success
the
bird
will
fly
directly
to
his
coop
and
later
when
i
give
him
the
time
we
liberated
it
and
he
notes
the
time
of
arrival
he
can
figure
the
cried
dave
is
the
pigeon
it
was
brought
out
in
the
basket
where
it
had
been
held
captive
and
dale
who
understood
such
matters
prepared
a
short
message
on
thin
paper
the
paper
was
put
in
a
quill
sealed
at
both
ends
and
then
tied
by
silk
thread
to
one
of
the
wings
the
bird
was
taken
to
the
deck
of
the
craft
and
liberated
it
soared
high
in
the
air
circled
about
once
or
twice
and
then
even
in
that
void
seeming
to
get
its
bearings
it
darted
off
to
the
south
we
will
learn
how
my
friend
received
the
message
said
dale
now
i
think
we
had
better
change
our
the
lined
the
coast
a
few
miles
to
the
interior
until
dusk
dave
and
the
others
viewed
a
constantly
changing
panorama
then
there
was
supper
a
bountiful
meal
well
prepared
and
immensely
relished
by
all
hands
after
that
lights
were
set
the
big
headlights
front
and
rear
sending
out
shafts
of
radiance
that
must
have
appeared
to
uninitiated
landsmen
as
streaming
meteors
king
was
in
the
cabin
when
the
electric
call
bell
took
him
to
the
speaking
tube
he
dropped
it
as
if
some
important
message
called
him
instantly
to
the
pilot
room
his
manner
and
face
indicated
to
the
young
aviator
that
whatever
message
he
had
received
had
urged
him
to
seriousness
and
haste
up
eh
dave
shot
out
hiram
as
the
airman
hurried
from
the
cabin
looks
that
way
assented
dave
wonder
what
chapter
xii
adrift
in
the
storm
the
two
young
aviators
alive
to
every
motion
of
the
and
the
movements
of
its
operators
sat
together
on
one
of
the
observation
benches
see
any
change
in
our
course
remarked
hiram
glancing
from
the
window
do
i
said
dave
a
flash
i
saw
it
spoke
hiram
quickly
it
think
so
in
fact
i
am
sure
of
it
yes
it
has
all
clouded
a
wind
coming
added
hiram
is
it
grimshaw
he
questioned
as
there
was
a
ring
at
the
tube
hook
to
close
everything
up
fast
and
tight
reported
the
veteran
aeronaut
a
storm
coming
sure
enough
said
hiram
even
before
they
had
all
the
windows
closed
a
change
of
atmosphere
was
noticeable
a
blast
of
wind
roared
around
the
giant
airship
course
this
serious
observed
hiram
i
think
not
rejoined
the
young
aviator
the
weather
a
little
land
zephyr
no
good
over
the
king
is
simply
taking
all
precautions
said
dave
did
you
feel
that
there
was
a
whirl
that
made
the
young
airmen
think
of
their
past
experience
in
striking
an
air
pocket
when
aboard
their
monoplane
bang
went
a
pitcher
of
water
from
the
table
in
the
center
of
the
cabin
tipping
exclaimed
hiram
upwards
said
grimshaw
to
strike
a
calmer
upper
current
i
fancy
suggested
dale
hiram
made
his
way
to
a
window
and
tried
to
peer
out
the
rain
was
beating
in
rattling
dashes
against
the
thick
panes
he
reported
you
want
to
see
a
sea
of
black
ink
come
call
it
a
blaze
of
dazzling
light
submitted
grimshaw
as
there
was
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
followed
by
a
tremendous
crack
of
thunder
all
below
us
now
reported
hiram
a
few
minutes
later
must
be
above
the
storm
cloud
then
said
grimshaw
some
wind
yet
thinking
observed
dale
there
came
a
signal
from
the
tube
bell
just
then
grimshaw
being
nearest
took
up
the
tube
and
received
the
message
dashaway
he
spoke
in
his
quick
laconic
way
king
the
young
aviator
left
the
cabin
at
once
all
over
the
hull
of
the
great
airship
was
an
electric
light
system
the
lamps
were
placed
at
intervals
along
the
passages
and
dave
found
no
difficulty
in
threading
them
he
arrived
at
the
pilot
room
to
find
king
at
the
glass
table
and
professor
leblance
holding
his
hand
out
through
a
small
porthole
the
inside
glass
shield
of
which
was
thrown
back
the
airman
looked
serious
and
occupied
with
the
various
buttons
on
the
table
the
face
wore
a
somewhat
anxious
look
he
drew
in
his
arm
as
he
did
so
dave
observed
that
his
hand
held
a
little
meteorological
instrument
he
had
noticed
before
it
was
a
barometric
contrivance
the
professor
held
it
up
to
the
light
and
scanned
its
surface
closely
do
at
all
he
announced
index
is
not
broad
enough
to
give
exact
is
the
aerometer
professor
suggested
king
i
not
tell
you
i
found
one
of
its
tubes
shattered
such
carelessness
i
would
no
more
start
across
the
ocean
without
a
perfect
instrument
than
without
a
stop
a
descent
and
where
professor
leblance
indulged
in
his
accustomed
shrug
of
the
shoulders
dare
not
descend
not
knowing
the
exact
conditions
below
as
i
stated
we
are
on
a
fair
why
not
continue
till
the
situation
clears
can
only
run
one
with
the
storm
but
we
are
not
leaving
the
coast
line
to
any
appreciable
is
true
but
we
may
get
too
far
we
can
soon
make
that
up
we
will
have
to
land
near
some
large
city
i
suppose
to
get
what
you
necessarily
replied
the
frenchman
i
need
is
some
quicksilver
i
have
plenty
of
surplus
what
is
the
programme
ahead
watching
the
wind
gauge
and
the
grade
will
go
to
the
engine
here
dashaway
ordered
the
expert
airman
his
junior
assistant
was
prompt
to
gain
the
side
of
his
superior
understand
the
guide
inquired
king
is
on
the
same
principle
as
the
aeroplane
apparatus
assented
dave
it
closely
for
variations
and
the
wind
record
if
the
mirror
shows
a
deviation
past
the
fifteen
mark
notify
the
wind
fifty
miles
an
hour
is
we
will
have
to
descend
ascend
dave
seated
himself
in
a
chair
at
one
end
of
the
table
the
guide
a
delicately
adjusted
instrument
recorded
every
variation
in
the
progress
of
the
airship
the
wind
gauge
was
connected
by
wires
with
a
vane
on
top
of
the
gas
bag
dave
turned
to
his
duty
with
interest
and
carefulness
his
monoplane
experience
stood
him
in
good
stead
he
felt
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
in
realizing
that
he
was
actually
sharing
in
operating
the
and
in
addition
to
that
learning
something
practical
and
of
value
inside
of
five
minutes
he
had
mastered
the
requirements
of
the
occasion
and
was
working
in
entire
harmony
with
the
airman
for
over
three
hours
the
was
kept
on
as
perfectly
straight
a
course
as
could
be
mapped
out
seem
to
have
encountered
a
heavy
southwest
storm
of
great
extent
king
told
him
we
got
to
pass
over
its
entire
length
before
we
land
asked
the
young
aviator
leblance
thinks
that
plan
best
replied
king
it
must
have
been
nearly
midnight
when
the
frenchman
came
back
from
the
engine
room
was
his
first
commendatory
word
does
not
seem
to
have
strained
a
seam
i
must
congratulate
you
the
airman
smiled
pleasantly
at
this
praise
and
dave
bowed
modestly
the
professor
again
took
the
barometric
readings
think
we
have
hit
the
tail
of
the
wind
he
announced
a
few
minutes
later
soon
as
we
are
sure
of
it
we
will
make
a
that
suddenly
called
out
the
young
aviator
boom
a
great
shock
traversed
the
airship
in
succession
there
followed
a
muffled
bang
and
it
was
apparent
that
the
sounds
were
caused
by
some
trouble
in
the
airship
professor
leblance
rushed
from
the
room
chapter
xiii
a
first
landing
the
young
aviator
was
not
unused
to
in
his
professional
experience
he
noted
no
deviation
in
the
straight
progress
of
the
king
did
not
distract
attention
from
the
signal
plate
still
dave
awaited
some
explanation
of
the
detonation
with
curiosity
and
anxiety
all
right
reported
professor
leblance
reappearing
a
few
minutes
later
questioned
the
airman
simply
three
of
the
balloonets
blew
means
replied
the
frenchman
with
his
accustomed
shrug
of
the
shoulders
must
have
struck
a
warm
current
ah
yes
that
is
true
he
added
as
he
made
the
thermometer
test
see
the
sudden
transition
from
cold
caused
an
expansion
and
affected
the
that
weaken
the
lifting
force
professor
inquired
dave
perceptibly
i
count
on
such
accidents
more
or
less
i
can
duplicate
the
balloonets
and
as
to
the
have
arranged
for
all
necessary
replenishment
in
that
direction
king
everything
is
favorable
for
a
right
replied
the
airman
you
any
idea
where
we
are
should
say
south
of
virginia
then
still
farther
south
i
have
measured
the
distance
covered
since
our
start
but
i
do
not
know
how
far
we
are
king
left
dave
in
charge
of
the
signal
table
for
a
few
moments
he
went
to
the
lookout
meantime
instructing
the
young
aviator
as
to
what
buttons
he
should
operate
this
brought
the
on
a
lateral
slant
the
enormous
headlight
at
the
prow
of
the
airship
cast
a
glow
far
below
king
was
able
to
trace
outlines
on
the
landscape
he
returned
to
the
pilot
table
and
following
his
directions
there
were
many
changes
made
in
the
course
of
the
giant
airship
during
the
next
half
hour
once
more
the
aviator
consulted
the
lookout
then
back
again
at
his
post
he
ordered
a
and
a
gentle
gradual
drop
breathed
dave
at
last
intensely
interested
in
all
the
gentle
and
natural
movements
of
the
descent
and
that
was
certainly
easy
replied
his
patron
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
satisfaction
professor
understands
his
the
frenchman
soon
appeared
followed
by
two
of
his
assistants
the
aviator
and
dave
accompanied
him
to
the
cabin
people
had
better
go
to
bed
he
directed
all
hands
men
will
attend
to
securing
the
machine
safe
and
sound
we
can
do
nothing
now
until
this
order
was
obeyed
dave
and
hiram
had
what
might
be
called
a
stateroom
to
themselves
it
was
narrow
but
cozy
it
had
a
window
opening
and
there
the
young
aviator
posted
himself
for
some
time
by
the
aid
of
the
headlights
dave
could
make
out
leblance
and
his
men
securing
the
the
craft
seemed
to
have
landed
on
flat
land
rather
bare
of
verdure
and
with
no
trees
ideal
spot
for
landing
dave
reported
to
his
comrade
but
where
are
we
questioned
hiram
some
wild
mountain
district
i
should
say
responded
virginia
maybe
north
it
has
been
a
dandy
cruise
declared
hiram
gone
through
so
much
excitement
i
believe
i
can
sleep
a
it
anyhow
recommended
dave
may
be
a
lot
to
do
in
the
morning
and
we
want
to
be
rested
and
strong
to
take
our
share
in
how
long
he
rested
dave
dashaway
did
not
know
but
he
was
suddenly
awakened
by
feeling
the
moving
at
first
he
imagined
that
he
must
be
dreaming
for
certainly
he
did
not
think
they
would
start
off
again
after
making
a
landing
with
such
trouble
she
sure
is
moving
decided
the
lad
not
in
the
air
if
my
senses
are
good
for
anything
that
is
unless
bumping
along
a
cloud
he
sat
up
in
his
berth
and
could
make
out
a
dim
light
in
the
room
beyond
he
listened
and
heard
hiram
breathing
heavily
fast
asleep
anyhow
decided
the
young
aviator
takes
a
good
deal
to
disturb
him
but
we
sure
are
moving
i
such
a
strange
thought
came
to
him
that
he
hesitated
to
put
it
into
form
but
he
decided
to
reason
it
out
it
be
he
mused
i
have
slept
through
a
whole
night
and
day
without
knowing
it
and
that
we
are
on
the
move
again
can
anything
have
the
others
been
not
have
known
what
has
happened
it
seem
possible
and
his
was
interrupted
by
a
more
violent
motion
of
the
airship
it
seemed
to
careen
to
one
side
and
then
right
itself
dave
found
himself
clutching
the
sides
of
his
bunk
then
came
a
period
of
calm
going
to
wake
hiram
up
decided
dave
may
not
like
it
but
i
want
to
talk
to
some
one
about
this
and
if
he
gets
mad
in
case
it
anything
he
can
easily
get
to
sleep
again
and
what
i
do
unless
i
find
out
going
dave
cautiously
got
out
of
bed
as
he
did
so
he
again
felt
the
lurch
of
the
big
craft
at
the
same
time
he
heard
a
voice
speaking
softly
outside
hickory
came
the
tones
seem
to
be
ole
shebang
much
guess
hev
go
git
another
mule
critter
or
two
snake
it
away
whoa
there
in
the
name
of
sweet
spirits
of
nitre
is
going
on
murmured
dave
some
one
trying
to
steal
the
he
crossed
softly
to
look
out
of
one
of
the
windows
but
could
see
nothing
the
big
headlights
had
been
extinguished
and
save
for
some
few
incandescents
here
and
there
which
were
only
dimly
glowing
there
was
no
illumination
inside
the
ship
it
had
been
decided
to
make
it
dark
so
all
hands
would
sleep
better
is
sure
mysterious
went
on
dave
see
anything
but
i
can
hear
and
i
he
added
a
moment
later
for
again
the
craft
moved
slightly
once
more
the
young
aviator
peered
out
but
he
could
discern
nothing
the
night
was
very
black
i
he
began
when
a
sleepy
voice
from
the
adjoining
berth
inquired
dave
time
brkfust
hiram
whispered
dave
shrilly
up
something
has
happening
now
instantly
hiram
sat
upright
in
his
bed
he
was
rather
a
slow
chap
but
on
occasions
could
move
lively
is
it
he
inquired
in
a
low
voice
in
here
dave
know
maybe
it
is
and
maybe
it
anyhow
i
think
in
right
then
wait
until
they
do
get
in
nab
lay
low
just
what
i
want
to
do
replied
dave
may
happen
unless
we
get
busy
they
may
even
get
away
with
the
away
with
the
cried
hiram
are
you
talking
about
dave
how
can
but
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
at
that
moment
there
came
another
lurch
to
the
craft
and
it
moved
several
feet
hoarsely
whispered
dave
did
i
tell
you
we
going
night
flight
asked
hiram
know
i
was
awakened
by
the
movement
and
been
going
on
ever
since
someone
is
outside
sure
listen
now
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
and
then
a
cautious
voice
could
be
heard
saying
suah
will
have
done
go
git
another
mule
critter
move
this
contraption
i
got
no
of
my
own
have
to
borrow

off
nate
jackson
then
want
me
whack
up
with
him
there
no
help
fer
as
i
kin
see
exclaimed
dave
in
triumph
sure
is
strange
said
hiram
guess
better
wake
up
the
others
king
and
dale
ought
to
know
about
but
there
was
no
need
for
the
boys
to
awaken
their
companions
the
next
moment
there
came
such
a
violent
motion
to
the
ship
that
not
a
sleeper
continued
to
slumber
with
one
accord
they
tumbled
out
of
their
berths
then
from
without
came
a
chorus
of
excited
shouts
there
consarn
ye
all
what
ye
mean
by
and
that
stand
still
pesky
mule
critters
that
ye
be
ye
pull
this
shebang
when
i
wanted
ye
to
now
run
away
with
it
whoa
there
cried
king
is
going
on
demanded
dale
has
happened
shouted
professor
leblance
right
agreed
dave
going
on
is
trying
to
make
off
with
the
airship
added
hiram
off
with
the
airship
repeated
the
professor
it
he
did
not
finish
but
in
a
moment
he
had
switched
on
a
number
of
lights
including
the
two
big
ones
outside
the
craft
then
as
they
looked
from
the
windows
they
saw
a
strange
sight
an
unkempt
man
with
a
team
of
mules
had
fastened
a
rope
to
the
and
was
evidently
trying
to
drag
it
away
he
started
back
in
alarm
at
the
sudden
illumination
and
hastily
began
taking
off
the
rope
what
are
you
trying
to
do
cried
king
through
an
open
window
land
is
there
folks
in
this
shebang
asked
the
mountaineer
i
thought
it
was
a
balloon
that
had
come
you
were
going
to
haul
it
away
and
claim
a
reward
i
suppose
put
in
the
professor
beginning
to
understand
the
situation
what
i
was
came
the
answer
my
mules
strong
enough
i
was
arter
another
pair
when
turned
up
your
kerosene
lamps
she
hardly
should
say
not
with
the
way
she
is
fastened
said
the
frenchman
explain
yourself
my
name
but
it
much
matter
came
the
answer
was
on
my
way
home
from
settlement
with
a
load
of
stuff
keep
my
wife
kids
in
bacon
flour
when
i
seen
ye
come
down
last
i
once
went
a
county
fair
they
had
a
balloon
assent
perfesser
offered
five
dollars
git
his
balloon
arter
he
jumped
out
of
it
she
drifted
jackson
was
lucky
man
he
found
balloon
in
black
cedar
swamp
he
hauled
it
town
got
his
five
when
i
seen
this
contraption
come
down
i
just
laid
low
git
reward
i
you
folks
would
all
go
home
until
anyhow
but
ye
i
onhitched
my
mules
arter
dark
got
a
rope
from
my
wagon
tried
haul
balloon
away
but
she
haul
mighty
sorry
if
i
disturbed
travel
on
now
this
is
most
forsaken
country
i
ever
knowed
hard
git
money
i
thought
i
saw
an
easy
way
make
a
five
dollar
worth
more
than
that
to
have
our
airship
let
alone
my
man
said
the
professor
is
the
kind
of
a
balloon
you
never
saw
before
here
are
ten
dollars
for
the
wife
and
little
ones
and
he
passed
over
a
bill
the
man
was
overwhelmingly
grateful
and
apologized
again
for
the
trouble
he
had
caused
a
hasty
examination
showed
that
he
had
not
damaged
the
craft
any
by
his
pulling
and
hauling
and
a
little
later
he
had
disappeared
in
the
darkness
with
his
critters
and
soon
the
rumble
of
his
wagon
over
the
road
that
was
hardly
more
than
a
trail
came
fainter
and
fainter
to
the
ears
of
the
aviators
that
sure
was
a
scare
exclaimed
dave
when
quiet
was
once
more
restored
should
say
yes
agreed
hiram
idea
of
trying
to
cart
off
the
his
explanation
was
natural
said
the
professor
mountaineers
in
this
lonely
region
scarcely
ever
see
money
i
guess
but
now
boys
get
to
bed
got
lots
to
do
everyone
again
retired
after
the
lights
had
again
been
turned
low
and
dave
and
hiram
were
soon
asleep
again
it
was
two
hours
after
daylight
when
grimshaw
routed
them
out
of
their
berths
get
up
here
he
ordered
you
want
to
miss
certainly
announced
the
active
hiram
hungry
as
a
a
capital
meal
waiting
for
you
observed
the
old
aeronaut
the
boys
found
this
true
as
they
came
in
at
second
table
in
the
cabin
they
hurried
through
with
the
meal
for
outside
on
the
ground
king
and
the
others
were
assembled
from
their
actions
the
young
aviator
concluded
that
some
active
discussion
was
in
progress
exit
from
the
cabin
was
made
through
a
trap
door
and
a
balancing
ladder
piped
hiram
as
he
reached
the
ground
a
chance
to
stretch
our
legs
and
breathe
some
fresh
see
what
is
going
on
with
the
others
suggested
dave
and
they
approached
the
group
made
up
of
professor
leblance
king
grimshaw
and
dale
are
evidently
in
some
remote
spot
the
frenchman
was
saying
the
better
that
for
we
shall
have
no
troublesome
visitors
my
men
can
attend
to
the
balloonet
and
some
other
needful
repairs
while
we
send
for
that
means
the
location
of
the
nearest
town
submitted
the
airman
was
so
much
excitement
last
night
i
forgot
to
ask
that
old
mountaineer
but
we
must
locate
a
that
may
be
somewhat
agreed
the
frenchman
once
down
in
the
valley
yonder
it
is
to
be
supposed
there
are
some
tokens
of
is
to
go
inquired
dale
think
you
had
better
entrust
the
matter
to
me
professor
said
the
aviator
let
one
of
the
with
shall
be
glad
said
dave
eagerly
on
broke
in
hiram
me
a
show
too
you
king
the
aviator
took
a
brief
look
at
the
earnest
beseeching
face
of
the
willing
and
accommodating
young
aeronaut
and
smiled
indulgently
you
two
make
a
hardy
useful
team
so
make
it
so
if
you
arrangements
were
made
for
the
departure
at
once
it
was
understood
that
the
would
remain
at
its
present
landing
place
until
the
exploring
party
returned
with
the
quicksilver
even
if
they
had
to
consume
considerable
time
in
locating
a
town
think
we
can
make
it
and
return
by
nightfall
said
the
airman
worry
though
if
we
are
longer
spoke
the
professor
leave
till
we
get
that
quicksilver
no
matter
how
long
it
a
plentiful
lunch
a
compass
and
a
gun
were
gotten
ready
by
the
cabin
man
then
waving
a
cheery
adieu
to
their
friends
the
airman
and
the
boys
started
down
the
mountain
side
chapter
xiv
lost
no
use
not
shouted
ourselves
hoarse
and
in
this
still
air
and
the
way
we
have
kept
up
the
hollering
anyone
could
hear
us
five
miles
away
it
seems
to
there
is
only
one
conclusion
to
arrive
at
observed
the
young
aviator
quite
seriously
that
dave
are
reckon
right
assented
hiram
ruefully
dropping
to
the
ground
and
reclining
on
the
grass
his
companion
followed
his
example
it
was
six
in
the
afternoon
the
sun
was
descending
and
at
the
end
of
ten
hours
spent
in
persistent
search
of
a
town
or
settlement
this
had
been
the
result
of
their
hard
travel
and
laborious
investigations
the
trio
who
had
left
the
had
kept
together
until
about
noon
not
a
wagon
track
or
even
a
footpath
had
they
come
across
much
less
a
human
habitation
the
landscape
seemed
as
wild
and
untenanted
as
if
it
were
a
primeval
wilderness
hardly
know
what
to
do
said
the
old
aviator
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
as
they
concluded
a
rest
and
a
lunch
we
may
go
on
for
miles
and
miles
and
not
run
across
a
human
being
returned
hiram
who
was
tired
out
have
half
a
mind
to
return
to
the
while
we
are
pretty
sure
to
find
our
way
remarked
king
advise
that
we
make
an
air
flight
for
civilized
might
try
as
far
as
the
other
side
of
that
big
hill
suggested
dave
pointing
to
a
lofty
eminence
in
the
distance
may
not
be
a
bad
idea
replied
king
here
make
a
circuit
it
be
over
a
few
miles
trail
the
valley
this
way
you
boys
take
the
other
direction
and
meet
on
the
other
side
of
the
a
good
arrangement
declared
hiram
and
the
divided
journey
was
begun
it
proved
a
very
unwise
experiment
the
way
things
turned
out
the
circuit
was
not
so
easy
to
follow
as
it
had
seemed
pursuing
a
ravine
and
its
branches
at
the
end
of
three
hours
the
boys
found
themselves
inextricably
mixed
up
as
to
location
or
direction
with
so
many
hills
in
view
that
they
could
not
tell
which
was
the
one
they
had
had
in
view
when
they
separated
from
the
aviator
observed
hiram
now
looking
rather
hopelessly
about
them
lost
the
thing
is
to
find
ourselves
said
dave
cheerily
of
all
king
has
got
all
the
lunch
mourned
hiram
here
dave
when
are
you
going
to
make
a
start
from
here
when
we
get
rested
press
right
forward
and
get
to
a
town
or
back
to
the
easily
said
but
not
we
can
try
we
suppose
hiram
was
out
of
sorts
his
gloom
somewhat
abated
however
and
finally
walking
on
they
came
across
a
big
patch
of
wild
raspberries
when
a
little
later
dave
discovered
a
pecan
tree
hiram
quite
recovered
his
spirits
hardly
hope
to
rejoin
king
said
dave
think
i
can
keep
the
general
direction
of
the
in
view
what
i
say
is
to
brace
up
and
keep
steadily
ahead
for
a
few
hours
and
see
if
we
come
across
something
encouraging
a
full
moon
you
know
besides
at
night
we
could
make
out
lights
at
a
distance
you
see
even
if
we
fail
we
can
surely
get
back
to
the
if
we
lose
our
even
then
persisted
dave
can
we
i
heard
professor
leblance
tell
king
that
if
we
did
not
return
by
midnight
he
would
have
the
big
searchlight
on
the
at
grand
cried
hiram
bracing
up
magically
can
see
the
searchlight
for
a
good
many
miles
you
the
wayfarers
threaded
several
tortuous
valleys
they
reasoned
that
if
they
could
get
out
of
the
mountains
they
were
sure
to
come
upon
some
little
farm
it
was
near
dusk
when
hiram
who
was
a
little
in
advance
of
dave
shouted
suddenly
something
is
it
questioned
our
hero
hurrying
up
to
where
he
stood
his
companion
held
up
what
looked
like
a
broken
tree
branch
only
the
bark
had
been
peeled
off
from
it
and
one
end
had
evidently
been
fashioned
into
a
handle
with
a
pocket
knife
driving
live
stock
has
been
too
declared
hiram
inspecting
the
whip
broke
and
he
threw
it
away
hold
on
i
was
long
enough
on
a
farm
to
trail
a
cattle
track
if
one
around
here
yes
there
is
and
the
tone
rose
in
volume
as
he
bent
over
and
running
along
inspected
the
ground
keenly
it
asked
the
young
aviator
pressing
close
after
his
comrade
plain
enough
now
come
on
dave
in
luck
they
could
now
make
out
a
beaten
track
and
tell
the
irregularities
in
the
ground
made
by
the
trampling
of
many
feet
the
track
finally
ended
at
the
edge
of
a
small
stream
where
they
forded
the
brook
explained
hiram
take
off
our
shoes
and
stockings
and
wade
this
they
did
the
opposite
bank
gained
they
saw
through
a
fringe
of
bushes
what
looked
like
a
level
field
they
could
hear
occasional
bleatings
say
all
right
now
declared
the
sanguine
hiram
they
hurried
on
their
shoes
eager
to
pursue
their
investigations
sheep
are
over
yonder
said
hiram
pointing
to
a
corner
of
the
field
surely
near
some
farm
now
i
wonder
if
we
found
some
one
guarding
the
sheep
too
that
it
was
the
echo
of
distant
yelping
and
barking
to
which
hiram
called
attention
asked
dave
guessing
quickly
what
i
know
them
saw
lots
of
them
when
i
was
out
west
come
ahead
going
to
find
somebody
right
away
the
boys
now
noticed
a
little
knoll
the
bleating
sounds
seemed
to
echo
from
behind
it
as
they
started
up
the
incline
hiram
grabbed
his
companion
in
some
affright
and
dismay
and
both
fell
back
startled
a
sudden
flash
split
the
air
it
started
a
sweep
in
a
perfect
circle
like
a
revolving
searchlight
its
bright
rays
sent
out
a
glare
a
hundred
yards
from
its
base
then
the
circle
complete
as
suddenly
it
died
out
what
do
you
think
of
that
gasped
the
bewildered
hiram
and
more
of
it
bang
from
the
same
spot
just
as
abruptly
some
gun
or
cannon
belched
out
a
sheet
of
flame
followed
by
a
report
that
awoke
the
echoes
for
miles
in
every
direction
facing
a
mystery
they
could
not
explain
the
two
young
aviators
stood
staring
mutely
towards
the
spot
from
which
flash
and
report
had
so
unaccountably
come
chapter
xv
terrible
what
do
you
think
of
that
challenged
hiram
after
a
long
spell
of
wondering
silence
think
it
was
intended
for
us
responded
the
young
aviator
not
that
revolving
light
or
whatever
it
is
flashed
in
every
direction
and
that
firearm
aimed
towards
so
agreed
hiram
what
was
it
done
for
at
all
had
better
try
and
find
out
suggested
the
young
aviator
the
boys
waited
for
some
little
time
expecting
a
renewal
of
the
strange
manifestations
but
it
did
not
come
then
dave
led
the
way
creeping
up
the
incline
as
they
reached
the
top
of
the
knoll
they
paused
and
looked
about
them
sheltered
in
a
kind
of
a
dip
of
the
ground
they
could
make
out
half
a
hundred
sheep
huddled
together
no
human
being
was
visible
the
contrivance
that
flashed
and
fired
announced
hiram
pointing
to
a
small
raised
platform
at
the
edge
of
the
knoll
guess
it
is
assented
the
young
aviator
slow
hiram
no
need
to
run
any
neither
could
refrain
from
satisfying
his
curiosity
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
device
near
to
them
as
they
neared
it
proceeding
cautiously
the
bright
rays
of
the
moon
just
rising
showed
clear
outlines
of
the
platform
and
the
object
upon
it
ordered
dave
suddenly
as
they
waited
a
sharp
regular
and
prolonged
struck
their
hearing
a
clock
declared
hiram
or
eight
gun
barrels
and
wires
running
to
that
box
clock
works
in
it
see
the
light
is
still
burning
but
shut
in
with
a
so
nodded
dave
surprised
and
still
puzzled
say
cried
hiram
suddenly
guessed
out
the
whole
you
think
is
it
asked
the
young
aviator
this
is
a
contrivance
for
scaring
away
wolves
mighty
cute
and
it
must
be
a
smart
fellow
who
got
it
up
you
see
probably
every
hour
the
light
flashes
and
one
of
those
firearms
goes
off
that
would
scare
wolves
good
and
believe
you
have
solved
the
problem
said
dave
he
was
certain
of
it
as
they
made
a
closer
inspection
of
the
queer
contrivance
some
backwood
genius
had
spent
time
and
some
money
in
rigging
up
a
that
kept
up
an
alarm
and
illumination
through
the
night
serving
as
a
protection
for
the
sheepfold
course
a
house
somewhere
near
said
hiram
as
they
started
from
the
spot
look
light
cried
dave
what
looked
like
a
candle
or
lamp
in
a
window
showed
at
a
little
distance
the
young
adventurers
hurried
along
with
a
good
deal
of
satisfaction
they
finally
reached
a
roomy
log
cabin
with
a
barn
behind
it
as
they
passed
around
the
house
they
were
unable
to
discover
anybody
about
the
premises
they
knocked
and
then
hammered
at
the
front
door
there
was
no
response
and
hiram
shouted
but
no
one
appeared
walking
around
the
house
they
could
see
through
the
uncurtained
windows
into
every
room
no
one
in
the
house
it
seems
said
the
young
aviator
gone
to
some
suggested
hiram
is
that
suddenly
exclaimed
dave
towards
the
southeast
a
growing
glare
showed
in
the
sky
it
increased
in
brightness
each
moment
a
fire
declared
dave
think
so
too
run
for
it
spoke
hiram
they
had
gone
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
shots
and
then
shouts
rang
out
on
the
still
night
air
is
running
this
way
said
dave
against
the
radiance
of
the
mingled
fire
glow
and
the
moonlight
the
boys
saw
a
woman
hurriedly
crossing
a
clear
space
beyond
the
trees
she
held
a
baby
in
her
arms
a
little
girl
she
clasped
by
the
hand
the
baby
was
crying
and
the
woman
with
many
a
fearful
glance
back
of
her
was
sobbing
audibly
she
came
directly
towards
the
boys
dave
stepped
forward
in
her
path
the
woman
drew
back
with
a
shriek
of
alarm
be
frightened
said
dave
do
not
belong
to
the
raiders
the
woman
faltered
all
in
a
tremble
raiders
asked
hiram
terrible
macguffins
almost
wailed
the
woman
are
they
you
know
asked
the
woman
incredulously
are
strangers
here
madam
explained
the
young
airman
is
the
fire
and
what
is
the
trouble
our
men
are
from
the
officers
down
at
brambly
fork
said
the
woman
macguffins
have
made
a
raid
and
are
burning
us
all
out
they
may
kill
us
if
they
catch
us
oh
sirs
help
me
get
our
little
ones
in
hiding
she
pleaded
your
home
do
you
mean
inquired
dave
no
no
dissented
the
woman
instantly
is
the
worst
place
in
the
world
to
go
to
just
now
they
will
burn
our
house
may
not
harm
you
suggested
dave
they
will
my
husband
is
the
man
they
hate
the
most
an
old
quarrel
between
the
macguffins
and
our
people
they
will
harm
you
too
if
they
catch
should
they
asked
hiram
no
stranger
is
ever
allowed
in
these
carolina
mountains
they
are
all
moonshiners
and
will
take
you
for
detectives
they
shot
two
suspicious
characters
only
a
few
days
remarked
hiram
under
his
breath
in
a
nice
country
the
young
aviator
comprehended
the
situation
at
once
he
had
read
and
heard
of
these
north
carolina
outlaws
and
their
family
feuds
sometimes
running
through
half
a
dozen
generations
can
we
help
you
he
said
to
the
woman
safe
for
us
anywhere
around
here
she
declared
must
get
to
my
brambly
fork
you
mean
where
he
is
and
his
it
far
from
here
fifteen
miles
he
ought
to
know
about
the
macguffins
so
as
to
drive
them
away
before
they
steal
our
cattle
and
crops
i
can
manage
to
get
along
with
the
baby
but
the
little
girl
is
ready
to
drop
down
from
tiredness
see
oh
hide
hide
they
are
coming
this
way
among
the
trees
beyond
the
clearing
the
boys
could
see
men
with
torches
and
armed
with
rifles
coming
in
their
direction
are
going
to
fire
our
house
next
cried
the
woman
bursting
into
tears
am
afraid
it
would
be
foolish
for
us
to
try
and
prevent
them
remarked
dave
are
armed
and
in
a
dangerous
would
simply
risk
your
the
young
aviator
snatched
up
the
little
girl
in
his
arms
the
lady
hiram
he
directed
follow
dave
led
the
way
to
a
thick
copse
the
woman
told
the
little
girl
to
keep
perfectly
quiet
in
a
few
minutes
the
men
they
had
seen
passed
by
without
discovering
them
must
get
to
my
husband
at
once
said
the
woman
eagerly
as
soon
as
the
horde
of
raiders
was
out
of
sight
and
hearing
go
alone
observed
dave
we
will
go
with
you
take
turns
at
carrying
the
little
girl
the
woman
sobbed
out
her
heartfelt
gratitude
then
dave
questioned
her
as
to
the
direction
of
brambly
fork
and
all
were
soon
on
the
way
looking
for
king
dave
suggested
hiram
after
awhile
king
will
take
care
of
himself
hiram
replied
the
young
aviator
but
neither
is
this
looking
for
a
town
where
we
might
get
that
on
the
way
to
it
it
when
we
get
to
the
place
where
this
husband
is
some
of
the
crowd
can
direct
us
to
the
nearest
settlement
that
is
it
was
pretty
hard
traveling
after
a
day
of
heavy
tramping
the
forlorn
condition
of
the
woman
however
appealed
to
both
the
boys
are
very
near
brambly
fork
now
spoke
the
woman
at
the
end
of
four
hours
during
which
time
they
had
rested
frequently
turn
in
the
valley
and
we
will
be
enough
cried
hiram
with
animation
they
had
come
upon
a
spot
well
shut
in
on
three
sides
with
trees
a
big
campfire
was
burning
and
near
it
were
gathered
a
dozen
or
more
men
their
interest
was
centered
on
a
man
who
stood
with
his
arms
bound
behind
him
cried
dave
king
chapter
xvi
in
friendly
hands
the
young
aviator
did
not
delay
for
a
single
instant
so
precipitately
did
he
start
for
the
group
about
the
tree
that
he
fairly
knocked
hiram
off
his
footing
mischief
gasped
the
latter
righting
himself
and
staring
aghast
at
the
scene
a
little
distance
ahead
of
them
stop
shouted
dave
at
the
top
of
his
voice
as
he
dashed
across
the
open
stretch
and
momentarily
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
men
who
surrounded
the
airmen
dave
had
a
right
to
be
urgent
for
two
men
had
seized
hold
of
king
as
if
to
handle
him
roughly
three
rifles
were
aimed
at
dave
as
he
fearlessly
ran
up
to
the
group
one
of
the
party
evidently
the
leader
stared
at
our
hero
as
he
came
to
a
halt
with
a
suspicious
and
threatening
scowl
he
challenged
one
why
strangers
are
getting
thick
as
bees
in
swarming
another
detective
growled
a
man
by
his
side
dave
faced
the
mob
all
alive
with
anxiety
and
excitement
must
not
harm
that
man
he
declared
dauntlessly
him
do
you
inquired
the
leader
with
a
sinister
look
should
say
i
did
some
is
he
is
robert
king
the
great
what
he
said
but
we
believe
him
retorted
the
leader
at
that
badge
on
that
is
a
trophy
from
an
aero
club
explained
dave
what
it
says
and
see
that
i
am
telling
the
sonny
observed
the
man
with
a
derisive
laugh
any
schoolhouses
in
this
district
and
none
of
us
know
how
to
read
now
then
who
are
you
and
where
did
you
come
from
am
in
the
same
line
as
king
replied
dave
i
came
from
the
spot
where
our
airship
did
you
find
us
yes
said
dave
quickly
ran
across
the
macguffins
they
were
making
a
raid
if
the
young
aviator
had
thrown
a
firebrand
among
the
group
he
could
not
have
caused
more
excitement
at
the
mention
of
that
dread
name
macguffins
it
seemed
as
though
the
men
before
him
uttered
a
fearful
roar
of
hatred
and
rage
the
leader
sprang
forward
and
grasped
arm
you
fool
me
he
shouted
did
you
run
across
the
macguffins
fifteen
miles
north
of
here
they
were
burning
houses
dave
was
interrupted
by
a
cry
it
proceeded
from
the
woman
he
and
hiram
had
helped
she
appeared
now
upon
the
scene
carrying
her
babe
and
hiram
following
with
the
little
girl
in
his
arms
cried
the
woman
and
then
dave
knew
that
the
leader
of
the
outlaw
band
was
her
husband
the
man
stared
at
her
in
bewilderment
he
spoke
in
a
husky
voice
does
it
mean
you
being
here
jared
the
macguffins
she
wailed
have
burned
us
out
if
it
for
these
two
brave
boys
we
might
all
have
been
killed
they
hid
us
and
helped
me
get
here
with
the
did
this
spoke
the
man
in
a
tone
turning
to
the
young
aviator
that
fellow
is
your
friend
him
free
ordered
the
man
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
towards
king
to
you
young
man
made
some
friends
let
me
tell
dave
and
hiram
hurried
eagerly
to
the
spot
where
two
of
the
band
began
immediately
to
liberate
king
who
had
looked
worn
and
worried
a
glad
smile
of
relief
now
covered
his
face
came
just
in
the
nick
of
time
he
told
his
two
young
friends
looks
so
said
hiram
seriously
a
bad
nest
of
them
cautioned
the
airman
never
met
such
stubborn
unreasonable
beings
they
seem
to
have
two
objects
in
fight
each
other
and
dodge
revenue
outlaws
they
queried
hiram
and
with
little
idea
of
the
value
of
human
the
band
grouped
together
about
the
woman
who
was
reciting
the
incidents
of
the
raid
of
the
macguffins
wild
shouts
and
threats
followed
her
story
the
party
split
up
and
half
of
them
ran
to
a
thicket
to
reappear
with
horses
at
a
word
from
the
leader
they
set
off
in
the
direction
the
refugees
had
just
come
from
then
the
man
approached
the
airman
and
his
companions
rough
fellows
maybe
he
said
we
stick
like
glue
to
a
friend
you
two
young
fellows
saved
my
nance
and
the
babies
there
much
we
fellows
do
for
you
in
you
can
probably
help
us
out
a
good
deal
if
you
want
to
replied
dave
promptly
name
how
king
has
told
you
how
we
are
balloonists
we
need
some
quicksilver
and
the
three
of
us
had
started
out
to
locate
some
town
where
we
could
get
the
eh
repeated
the
outlaw
as
though
dubious
and
puzzled
would
you
be
likely
to
get
it
now
hardware
or
drug
stores
keep
it
explained
dave
else
you
need
only
to
return
to
our
balloon
when
we
get
the
shouted
the
man
beckoning
to
two
of
his
men
and
make
a
quick
run
for
forestville
how
much
quicksilver
do
you
want
comes
in
iron
tubes
explained
the
airman
will
answer
if
they
keep
it
in
some
other
form
about
thirty
back
soon
as
you
can
the
outlaw
ordered
his
messengers
the
places
are
shut
shoot
up
the
town
and
get
some
action
on
the
the
speaker
turned
and
proceeded
to
where
a
tent
stood
in
a
little
while
he
reappeared
to
say
to
his
guests
that
they
must
be
hungry
and
to
follow
him
seated
on
rude
camp
stools
the
three
friends
enjoyed
a
meal
of
corn
pone
sweet
potatoes
and
wild
turkey
all
cooked
to
a
turn
then
their
host
threw
some
blankets
on
the
ground
outside
he
invited
them
to
be
seated
and
for
over
an
hour
asked
question
after
question
regarding
their
wonderful
airship
and
the
great
world
beyond
the
wilderness
of
which
he
knew
so
little
perfectly
safe
to
sleep
here
remarked
king
as
the
man
left
them
finally
than
safe
declared
dave
people
would
protect
us
with
their
lives
the
way
they
feel
about
the
wayfarers
were
pretty
well
tired
out
all
three
were
soon
asleep
it
must
have
been
two
hours
later
when
dave
felt
himself
roughly
shaken
the
outlaw
leader
and
two
others
were
standing
near
staring
up
into
the
sky
in
an
awed
puzzled
way
that
asked
the
outlaw
leader
of
the
young
aviator
strange
to
us
and
i
thought
across
the
sky
in
the
direction
of
the
airship
a
broad
sweeping
pencil
of
light
swept
the
heavens
from
zenith
to
horizon
and
back
again
that
said
dave
the
great
searchlight
of
the
chapter
xvii
a
trusty
guide
the
young
aviator
had
to
do
some
explaining
for
the
benefit
of
the
outlaw
leader
before
the
latter
could
understand
what
a
searchlight
was
no
spot
safe
for
a
free
and
easy
fellow
with
all
these
contrivances
remarked
the
man
like
to
see
that
balloon
all
the
same
observed
one
of
his
band
better
keep
close
to
the
safety
line
advised
the
leader
a
good
deal
of
hubbub
around
and
better
watch
out
for
the
it
was
an
hour
later
when
the
two
men
sent
to
forestville
came
galloping
back
into
camp
they
were
hot
tired
and
dusty
their
steeds
were
reeking
and
dropped
their
heads
in
an
exhausted
way
as
their
riders
drove
up
to
the
campfire
and
dismounted
you
get
the
stuff
inquired
the
leader
what
you
sent
us
for
it
queried
one
of
the
horsemen
there
it
is
and
he
handed
out
a
package
had
some
trouble
making
the
drug
clerk
understand
how
badly
and
quickly
we
needed
it
remarked
the
other
horseman
with
a
chuckle
we
told
him
that
forestville
would
be
off
the
map
in
a
few
days
if
he
act
lively
he
produced
results
double
king
examined
the
package
it
contained
two
large
glass
tubes
filled
with
quicksilver
he
thanked
the
men
heartily
his
hand
went
to
his
pocket
and
his
purse
was
half
withdrawn
to
offer
a
reward
when
he
noted
a
warning
flash
in
the
eyes
of
the
leader
try
to
pay
for
what
money
get
you
if
you
friends
said
the
man
tersely
are
anxious
to
get
back
to
the
airship
suggested
the
airman
to
start
right
away
if
searchlight
signal
will
guide
you
surely
besides
i
think
we
could
find
our
way
without
its
just
the
same
go
with
you
as
far
as
the
gap
hard
to
cross
unless
you
know
it
pretty
well
or
hit
a
trail
by
accident
as
you
seem
to
have
done
in
getting
here
hi
there
saddle
up
four
fresh
horses
ordered
the
speaker
to
one
of
his
men
is
pretty
fine
treatment
declared
the
young
aviator
as
his
friends
and
himself
found
themselves
in
the
saddle
and
the
outlaw
leader
piloting
the
way
from
the
camp
will
take
my
wife
a
long
time
to
forget
all
we
owe
you
the
leader
remarked
more
than
once
at
the
end
of
two
travel
the
latter
stages
of
which
were
taken
through
dark
and
sinuous
windings
along
a
ravine
their
pilot
ascended
a
long
slope
your
searchlight
still
going
he
said
pointing
to
the
broad
waving
flare
in
the
sky
dare
not
go
any
farther
with
you
for
two
reasons
he
explained
the
first
place
over
what
we
call
the
safety
line
in
the
next
place
i
want
to
get
back
in
time
to
start
a
daylight
hunt
after
those
feel
sure
we
can
find
our
way
to
the
now
said
the
young
aviator
that
was
a
queer
adventure
it
now
spoke
hiram
as
their
recent
guide
waved
his
hand
in
a
friendly
way
and
disappeared
like
a
flash
back
the
route
they
had
come
rough
fellows
are
true
blue
when
you
touch
the
right
spot
declared
the
airman
seem
to
be
on
higher
level
ground
than
before
let
us
get
along
as
fast
as
we
can
so
we
can
send
the
horses
the
outlaw
leader
had
insisted
that
they
retain
the
steeds
he
had
instructed
them
to
simply
head
them
back
homewards
when
they
were
through
with
them
fret
he
had
said
confidently
be
sure
to
find
the
camp
feeding
trough
before
breakfast
has
been
quite
an
adventure
as
you
say
hiram
remarked
king
as
they
trotted
single
file
on
account
of
the
narrow
course
probably
a
lot
more
of
it
waiting
us
along
the
line
added
dave
assented
hiram
can
guess
it
will
be
pretty
lively
if
we
cross
the
atlantic
say
getting
near
to
the
this
was
apparent
from
the
clearer
radiance
from
the
searchlight
glow
they
rode
on
about
two
miles
further
can
do
the
rest
on
foot
i
fancy
said
king
the
party
dismounted
arranged
the
bridles
so
they
would
not
trail
turned
the
heads
of
the
horses
homewards
for
them
and
giving
each
a
slap
on
the
flanks
watched
them
dart
away
rapidly
the
searchlight
faded
out
before
they
had
proceeded
a
mile
in
fact
day
was
breaking
the
sun
came
up
as
they
reached
the
bottom
of
a
high
hill
remember
this
spot
said
the
young
aviator
we
left
the
camp
this
way
agreed
king
casting
a
look
about
and
recognizing
some
landmarks
suppose
professor
leblance
has
been
mighty
anxious
about
us
said
hiram
have
a
great
story
to
tell
despite
the
arduous
rigors
of
their
tramp
and
adventures
dave
and
hiram
felt
fresh
and
ambitious
pretty
near
the
top
spoke
the
young
aviator
race
you
to
see
who
arrives
right
agreed
hiram
we
dave
showed
the
most
endurance
he
reached
the
summit
paused
and
waved
his
hand
triumphantly
at
his
toiling
rival
on
called
hiram
for
take
a
look
first
answered
dave
the
young
aviator
climbed
over
a
low
ledge
of
boulders
beyond
them
was
a
fringe
of
high
bushes
dave
knew
that
these
passed
the
would
be
in
view
he
pressed
his
way
through
the
bushes
and
cleared
the
last
obstruction
at
a
leap
then
the
young
aviator
took
one
look
uttered
a
dismayed
cry
and
fairly
dived
back
in
among
the
undergrowth
startled
beyond
expression
chapter
xviii
in
a
bad
fix
back
shouted
the
young
aviator
he
accompanied
the
words
with
a
spring
and
a
roll
that
took
him
through
and
past
the
fringe
of
bushes
and
brought
him
directly
against
hiram
on
i
say
the
mischief
blurted
out
hiram
tipped
clear
off
his
balance
warned
dave
regaining
his
feet
go
ahead
make
any
disturbance
stop
dave
spoke
the
words
in
a
hurried
and
urgent
tone
then
cautiously
he
crept
on
all
fours
through
the
shrubbery
he
took
a
second
more
comprehensive
look
over
the
plateau
then
he
worked
his
way
back
to
the
bewildered
hiram
here
dave
dashaway
challenged
the
latter
acting
mighty
the
trouble
here
inquired
king
coming
up
to
the
boys
pursuant
to
mysterious
gestures
from
hiram
is
trouble
i
am
very
much
afraid
replied
dave
seriously
do
you
the
airship
king
the
seems
to
be
all
right
but
about
twenty
men
all
armed
with
guns
have
our
entire
party
cornered
near
some
say
so
cried
the
airman
me
have
a
careful
then
advised
dave
looks
to
me
as
if
another
band
of
these
wild
outlaws
probably
traced
the
searchlight
and
have
managed
to
catch
our
friends
away
from
the
airship
anyway
our
folks
are
helpless
and
the
strangers
look
fierce
and
all
three
of
the
adventurers
crept
through
the
fringe
of
underbrush
and
took
a
look
across
the
plateau
they
found
the
situation
as
dave
had
described
it
to
be
the
strangers
held
professor
leblance
dale
grimshaw
and
the
others
at
bay
a
big
fellow
evidently
the
leader
of
the
band
was
talking
animatedly
to
the
frenchman
the
others
of
the
intruders
held
their
rifles
in
a
way
that
threatened
an
attack
if
the
captives
showed
any
resistance
may
be
the
macguffins
whispered
hiram
intensely
wrought
up
with
excitement
wonder
said
dave
king
let
us
try
to
get
nearer
to
we
may
learn
what
is
going
on
and
give
our
friends
some
help
if
they
need
it
replied
the
airman
they
had
to
cover
half
a
mile
in
a
cautious
detour
this
finally
brought
them
to
a
thicket
not
thirty
feet
distant
from
their
friends
and
enemies
king
lay
flat
on
the
ground
behind
some
high
bushes
and
his
companions
followed
his
example
dave
bent
his
ear
keenly
to
catch
what
the
leader
of
the
invading
party
was
saying
go
with
me
the
man
said
do
we
know
that
you
here
to
spy
on
us
we
fine
trespassers
here
and
we
charge
rent
for
the
use
of
our
must
own
the
whole
state
you
fellows
must
snapped
out
grimshaw
run
this
district
if
you
want
to
know
it
retorted
the
outlaw
we
just
string
up
we
are
no
spies
declared
the
professor
earnestly
take
your
word
for
that
come
got
to
pay
your
reckoning
you
scrape
us
up
as
much
as
two
hundred
dollars
among
you
the
speaker
waved
his
hand
significantly
in
the
direction
of
the
growled
one
of
his
fellows
take
us
long
to
make
a
sieve
of
that
resent
this
outrage
cried
the
frenchman
hotly
are
under
international
protection
our
mission
is
in
the
interests
of
science
if
you
interfere
with
us
you
will
rouse
the
entire
community
it
will
be
the
worse
for
him
boys
rallied
the
outlaw
leader
stranger
going
to
tell
what
we
did
or
do
to
you
hey
the
speaker
grinned
in
a
way
that
made
hiram
dobbs
shiver
king
he
whispered
hoarsely
gun
against
twenty
count
for
much
responded
the
airman
with
a
shake
of
his
head
will
pay
no
ransom
i
will
give
you
not
one
cent
of
blackmail
declared
the
doughty
frenchman
thoroughly
indignant
right
then
we
will
ransack
your
old
gas
bag
and
take
what
we
want
boasted
the
outlaw
warn
you
cried
the
professor
airship
is
one
mass
of
devices
you
do
not
understand
you
may
find
do
you
bother
with
him
for
cried
the
man
beside
the
last
speaker
cover
the
rest
of
the
crowd
you
make
him
take
you
over
the
machine
and
get
lying
around
we
do
something
king
inquired
the
young
aviator
in
an
anxious
tone
fear
not
dashaway
was
the
reply
are
desperate
men
and
bound
to
have
their
own
way
we
can
only
hope
that
our
being
free
will
help
our
friends
somewhere
along
the
come
with
me
ordered
the
outlaw
leader
roughly
seizing
professor
leblance
by
the
arm
and
pulling
him
along
your
eyes
on
those
others
he
added
to
his
men
the
frenchman
held
back
with
resolute
face
and
force
the
outlaw
however
was
a
great
bulky
fellow
of
enormous
strength
they
had
proceeded
less
than
twenty
feet
towards
the
airship
when
a
quick
word
cut
the
air
clear
and
startling
as
a
pistol
shot
chapter
xix
a
mysterious
friend
in
an
instant
of
time
the
whole
complexion
of
affairs
had
changed
the
young
aviator
and
his
two
companions
crouched
staring
at
the
scene
before
them
which
now
seemed
the
stage
setting
to
some
intense
drama
gasped
the
excitable
hiram
does
that
mean
echoed
king
in
a
truly
astonished
way
dave
was
quite
as
fully
amazed
and
puzzled
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
a
form
had
sprung
into
view
just
beyond
one
of
the
floats
of
the
it
was
that
of
a
lithe
person
young
and
energetic
to
all
appearance
he
was
a
negro
for
hands
and
face
at
that
distance
were
of
seeming
ebony
hue
this
extraordinary
person
a
stranger
to
all
who
looked
upon
him
held
leveled
a
short
but
heavy
rifle
at
once
the
watchers
from
the
underbrush
recognized
it
as
one
of
several
weapons
provided
for
the
arsenal
of
the
giant
airship
before
the
had
left
croydon
the
magazine
rifle
dale
showed
us
exclaimed
hiram
the
fellow
holding
it
and
how
did
he
get
it
is
he
indeed
murmured
the
airman
staring
hard
at
the
person
who
had
so
startlingly
pronounced
that
mandatory
the
outlaw
leader
had
come
to
a
dead
stop
he
dropped
the
arm
of
the
professor
who
took
in
this
last
strange
incident
of
the
moment
in
a
very
bewildered
way
still
or
i
will
fire
rang
out
now
in
clear
vibrant
tones
those
of
the
band
guarding
the
rest
of
the
crew
of
the
stood
mute
and
staring
taken
aback
by
the
determined
and
threatening
attitude
of
the
person
near
the
balloon
one
of
your
men
so
much
as
raises
a
weapon
i
will
shoot
came
floating
distinctly
on
the
still
mountain
air
hold
a
magazine
rifle
in
my
hand
loaded
for
one
hundred
rounds
that
will
shoot
eighty
times
in
a
minute
order
your
men
to
put
down
their
the
outlaw
leader
hesitated
bang
ten
times
in
incredibly
rapid
succession
at
a
light
pressure
the
formidable
magazine
rifle
rang
out
aimed
however
at
the
boughs
of
a
nearby
tree
some
of
the
leaves
of
which
fell
in
scraps
and
ribbands
under
the
destructive
effect
of
the
powerful
fusillade
two
can
pick
them
off
before
they
can
raise
a
trigger
shouted
the
sable
champion
of
the
airship
crew
do
it
too
if
that
order
is
not
given
the
outlaw
leader
quailed
then
he
turned
and
made
a
sign
to
his
men
the
last
one
of
them
placed
his
gun
on
the
ground
came
the
inflexible
order
that
path
to
the
left
so
we
can
keep
you
in
view
you
will
find
your
weapons
safe
when
you
return
and
we
are
gone
go
the
menace
of
the
powerful
magazine
rifle
cowed
the
outlaw
gang
the
breathless
spectators
from
the
brush
saw
them
join
their
leader
unarmed
take
the
path
as
directed
and
file
away
from
the
plateau
the
person
who
had
so
marvellously
accomplished
all
this
never
lowered
his
weapon
still
holding
it
ready
for
instant
use
he
walked
over
to
where
a
ledge
of
rocks
rose
like
a
sentinel
tower
above
the
level
of
the
plateau
there
posting
himself
he
held
the
discomfited
retreating
foe
in
constant
sight
he
swung
his
hand
towards
the
stupefied
crew
of
the
airship
he
spoke
some
order
or
suggestion
to
them
that
dave
did
not
overhear
the
party
however
at
once
possessed
themselves
of
some
of
the
abandoned
rifles
of
the
outlaws
and
stood
ready
for
attack
and
defence
king
arose
and
hurried
over
to
where
professor
leblance
stood
and
dave
and
hiram
followed
him
cried
the
airman
are
some
strange
happenings
who
is
that
one
of
the
crew
never
saw
him
before
replied
the
dazed
frenchman
has
saved
the
we
have
the
quicksilver
this
is
a
dangerous
district
let
us
leave
as
soon
as
yes
said
the
frenchman
in
a
hurried
tone
what
has
happened
we
can
not
be
too
quickly
nor
fast
on
our
the
animated
engineer
of
the
bustled
about
into
immediate
action
he
ordered
two
of
his
men
to
join
their
rescuer
on
the
rocks
all
the
others
were
impressed
into
service
in
assisting
to
get
the
giant
airship
ready
for
a
new
and
longer
flight
it
did
not
take
fifteen
minutes
to
accomplish
this
one
by
one
professor
leblance
told
off
his
expert
assistants
to
their
duties
dave
and
hiram
had
been
kept
busy
but
more
than
once
the
young
aviator
had
glanced
in
the
direction
of
the
heroic
figure
on
the
rocks
he
saw
the
frenchman
say
some
quick
words
to
king
and
the
latter
then
approach
the
stranger
some
conversation
took
place
between
them
as
a
signal
for
starting
was
sounded
from
the
engine
room
king
turned
towards
the
airship
he
was
accompanied
by
the
person
with
the
magazine
rifle
all
hands
got
quickly
aboard
when
the
young
aviator
reached
the
cabin
he
found
their
mysterious
friend
seated
in
a
shaded
corner
of
the
place
then
the
activity
and
excitement
of
the
ascent
engrossed
all
minds
the
magnificent
arose
in
the
air
like
a
bird
it
attained
a
high
altitude
all
the
recent
troubles
of
its
crew
faded
away
like
light
feather
down
king
came
into
the
cabin
inside
of
half
an
hour
quickly
followed
by
professor
leblance
both
looked
intensely
curious
the
safely
started
on
a
steady
course
they
had
evidently
hastened
to
explore
the
mystery
of
the
strange
friend
who
had
aided
them
in
their
sorest
need
the
airman
approached
the
silent
figure
in
the
corner
of
the
cabin
he
extended
his
hand
warmly
grasping
that
of
the
shrinking
stranger
friend
he
said
up
to
the
table
we
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
you
asked
to
be
taken
aboard
and
said
you
would
then
explain
your
being
the
stranger
somewhat
reluctantly
took
a
chair
at
the
cabin
table
for
all
his
recent
heroic
attitude
he
acted
rather
embarrassed
and
frightened
now
he
looked
down
then
he
trembled
visibly
and
then
he
made
the
remarkable
statement
am
a
chapter
xx
the
stowaway
the
young
aviator
took
a
long
earnest
stare
at
the
mysterious
person
who
had
just
stated
that
he
was
a
stowaway
in
a
flash
dave
seemed
to
get
hold
of
one
end
of
a
long
chain
of
circumstances
and
mysteries
stowaway
repeated
professor
leblance
incredulously
mean
aboard
the
the
time
when
she
first
started
amaze
me
am
amazed
at
myself
came
the
words
in
rather
a
depressed
way
the
speaker
dropped
his
head
and
both
of
his
interlocutors
looked
troubled
and
more
puzzled
than
ever
tell
you
gentlemen
rather
not
say
much
till
i
am
sure
your
airship
is
out
of
the
country
you
know
you
promised
i
should
stay
aboard
if
i
wanted
to
he
added
to
king
surely
did
assented
the
airman
heartily
dave
had
been
studying
the
profile
of
the
stowaway
he
had
noticed
that
his
ebony
hue
was
due
entirely
to
soot
or
greased
lampblack
smeared
over
face
and
hands
further
the
keen
glance
of
the
young
aviator
had
scanned
closely
the
clothing
even
down
to
the
necktie
of
the
stranger
and
was
a
stranger
no
longer
to
dave
king
may
i
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
said
dave
moving
out
of
the
cabin
into
a
passageway
in
some
surprise
the
airman
followed
him
there
is
it
dashaway
he
asked
stowaway
i
know
him
king
declared
dave
hurriedly
is
a
certain
mystery
about
him
he
dares
not
explain
just
now
and
you
are
embarrassing
him
dreadfully
ask
him
any
more
questions
tell
him
to
come
to
my
stateroom
later
i
will
explain
everything
to
you
about
well
commented
the
airman
seem
to
have
the
faculty
for
preparing
surprises
for
your
friends
i
must
say
do
what
you
suggest
but
curious
to
understand
what
it
all
shall
soon
know
promised
the
young
aviator
and
he
went
to
the
little
space
where
he
and
hiram
slept
he
sat
down
on
one
of
the
berths
placing
a
stool
in
the
middle
of
the
room
for
his
expected
guest
will
find
a
friend
in
there
reached
ear
a
little
later
in
the
tones
of
the
airman
you
want
to
speak
to
me
rather
falteringly
asked
the
stowaway
entering
the
stateroom
king
retired
and
closed
the
door
after
him
yes
replied
dave
pleasantly
and
he
grasped
the
hand
of
his
guest
in
a
hearty
way
am
glad
to
see
you
and
doubly
glad
because
you
have
made
good
just
as
i
knew
you
would
i
once
told
a
friend
you
were
of
the
right
kind
proved
it
elmer
brackett
and
proud
of
i
see
you
know
me
made
good
proud
of
me
repeated
the
boy
in
a
dazed
way
you
saved
the
you
cried
the
young
aviator
in
a
spirited
tone
bound
to
rouse
and
buoy
up
his
guest
lives
too
probably
of
every
person
aboard
what
are
you
crying
sure
enough
young
brackett
was
crying
he
acted
like
a
boy
in
such
a
tangle
of
circumstances
that
he
was
fairly
crushed
finally
he
blurted
out
none
of
that
for
me
ever
again
i
not
challenged
dave
you
know
you
know
cried
the
young
man
seems
as
i
sit
here
in
the
strangest
position
a
fellow
ever
was
in
i
reckon
that
in
some
terrific
dream
only
one
clear
idea
i
can
cling
get
out
of
the
country
from
that
villain
vernon
am
i
right
spoke
dave
quickly
it
assented
brackett
in
a
lost
tone
of
voice
thought
so
now
then
see
here
you
are
among
the
best
friends
any
fellow
ever
had
you
have
just
been
the
best
kind
of
a
hero
ever
was
forget
everything
else
for
the
present
make
up
your
mind
that
whatever
your
troubles
may
be
a
combination
aboard
the
strong
enough
to
help
you
fight
your
way
clear
out
of
the
last
one
of
them
me
all
about
there
followed
the
most
interesting
hour
of
dave
life
the
friend
of
everybody
he
had
been
the
confidant
and
helper
of
many
a
lad
in
difficulties
as
bit
by
bit
the
strange
history
of
elmer
brackett
came
out
however
dave
conceded
that
it
was
the
most
remarkable
case
he
had
ever
handled
briefly
the
reckless
impetuous
son
of
the
big
man
in
the
interstate
aero
company
had
become
the
helpless
victim
of
the
schemes
of
vernon
young
brackett
did
not
tell
dave
everything
he
hinted
that
while
in
a
muddled
condition
he
had
been
induced
by
vernon
to
forge
a
number
of
notes
once
completely
in
the
power
of
the
schemer
the
latter
showed
no
mercy
he
appalled
brackett
by
claiming
that
he
could
send
him
to
the
penitentiary
disgrace
his
family
and
almost
ruin
his
business
these
claims
were
in
a
measure
exaggerations
elmer
brackett
then
lost
his
head
completely
his
one
thought
was
to
escape
from
vernon
he
disguised
himself
after
sending
a
letter
to
his
father
warning
him
against
the
forgeries
and
saying
he
was
going
to
seek
some
foreign
country
where
he
could
lose
himself
and
be
forgotten
had
no
money
i
dared
not
appeal
to
friends
for
vernon
was
seeking
for
me
everywhere
to
tighten
the
chains
of
his
power
around
me
related
the
youth
bitterly
thought
of
you
and
while
tracing
down
the
i
ran
across
davidson
and
young
dawson
and
their
maybe
it
was
a
wild
idea
but
i
thought
how
it
would
just
suit
me
to
get
away
from
this
country
by
airship
for
vernon
had
claimed
that
if
i
left
him
he
would
have
the
detectives
looking
out
for
me
everywhere
well
i
hung
around
senca
then
as
i
think
much
of
the
way
the
showed
up
i
went
to
was
you
then
who
asked
my
friend
hiram
dobbs
about
me
and
wore
a
false
mustache
i
was
disguised
admitted
brackett
you
were
too
the
ghost
who
scared
the
watchman
at
the
aerodrome
nearly
into
fits
was
me
too
admitted
brackett
night
before
you
started
i
sneaked
aboard
the
airship
i
stowed
myself
away
behind
the
big
boxes
of
provisions
near
the
cabin
here
i
heard
and
saw
what
was
going
on
then
that
crowd
of
outlaws
came
i
got
the
magazine
gun
from
the
arsenal
i
here
you
wish
to
stay
till
we
get
across
the
atlantic
said
the
young
aviator
now
then
take
my
advice
forget
all
this
wretched
fear
and
trouble
that
is
part
of
your
past
help
us
win
the
great
prize
and
when
this
trip
is
over
trust
to
it
that
king
and
dale
will
find
time
and
money
to
squelch
this
miserable
vernon
straighten
out
your
affairs
and
start
you
on
a
new
elmer
brackett
minus
the
lampblack
and
encouraged
by
dave
was
soon
quite
another
person
in
appearance
and
spirits
to
the
refugee
stowaway
dave
imparted
to
his
friends
only
as
much
of
story
as
was
necessary
the
following
morning
the
boys
awoke
to
find
the
out
of
all
sight
of
land
fairly
started
on
the
great
trip
across
the
broad
atlantic
chapter
xxi
the
haunted
airship
fellows
this
is
life
on
the
ocean
wave
worth
seeing
it
hiram
dobbs
spoke
the
words
and
his
auditors
and
jolly
companions
were
the
young
aviator
and
elmer
brackett
it
was
the
second
evening
out
of
sight
of
land
the
had
made
splendid
speed
and
the
machinery
had
acted
like
a
charm
just
about
dusk
however
professor
leblance
had
ordered
a
drop
to
lower
level
is
a
low
barometric
pressure
dave
dashaway
had
heard
him
say
to
king
is
bound
to
be
a
change
in
the
air
currents
shortly
and
i
want
to
determine
our
course
from
the
way
they
act
there
are
some
repairs
to
make
also
and
we
will
slow
down
for
at
least
two
the
boys
were
immensely
interested
in
the
manœuvers
of
their
craft
under
the
direct
manipulation
of
the
professor
the
was
brought
to
the
surface
of
the
water
resting
on
its
floats
as
easily
and
gracefully
as
the
great
ocean
bird
it
was
named
after
a
hint
from
the
cook
sat
hiram
thinking
fresh
fish
would
come
in
very
acceptably
for
breakfast
next
morning
he
told
dave
and
the
trio
decided
to
take
the
lighter
of
the
two
boats
and
see
what
they
could
catch
king
warned
them
to
keep
within
hailing
range
of
the
airship
and
provided
them
with
trolling
lines
the
young
aviator
and
elmer
plied
the
oars
and
hiram
did
the
fishing
he
was
gloating
over
the
occasion
with
satisfaction
and
made
the
enthusiastic
remark
which
heads
the
chapter
as
he
deposited
a
final
catch
a
fat
codfish
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
will
do
hiram
directed
dave
have
got
more
fish
already
than
we
can
use
in
a
week
and
some
of
them
look
as
if
they
were
not
in
the
eating
class
the
cook
will
and
see
we
are
quite
a
distance
from
the
put
in
elmer
a
weird
warning
wind
sang
about
them
just
then
the
boys
had
been
so
engrossed
in
their
sport
they
had
failed
to
notice
that
some
scudding
clouds
had
obliterated
the
stars
to
work
elmer
ordered
dave
picking
up
the
oars
must
be
a
full
mile
from
the
and
maybe
that
storm
professor
leblance
told
about
is
going
to
catch
us
remarked
elmer
he
too
getting
in
shape
for
a
row
back
to
the
airship
the
minor
headlight
of
the
guided
them
and
for
this
a
dim
spark
in
the
distance
the
little
yawl
was
headed
the
water
had
become
choppy
but
the
oarsmen
felt
equal
to
the
task
of
the
moment
see
that
shouted
hiram
as
a
phosphorescent
streak
crossed
their
course
like
a
streak
of
another
one
ahead
said
elmer
and
look
look
exclaimed
hiram
a
shoal
of
fishes
big
fellows
too
say
see
them
leap
out
of
the
it
was
a
stimulating
sight
and
a
novel
one
to
the
boys
they
were
now
within
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
airship
as
hiram
spoke
the
big
searchlight
of
the
suddenly
flared
up
it
signalled
the
boys
to
return
as
dave
understood
it
going
to
make
a
throw
for
one
of
those
big
fellows
declared
hiram
do
it
whew
exclaimed
elmer
are
big
fellows
did
you
feel
that
some
object
had
landed
against
the
side
of
the
yawl
nearly
tipping
it
a
big
fish
almost
as
big
as
a
shark
shouted
hiram
chasing
the
smaller
ones
whoop
caught
something
hurrah
slow
down
oh
the
mischief
all
in
a
fleeting
second
the
excited
lad
shouted
out
tugged
at
the
trolling
line
bracing
his
feet
against
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
splash
the
boat
rang
out
the
voice
of
the
young
aviator
sharply
for
hiram
his
hand
tangled
in
the
trolling
line
had
been
pulled
clear
over
the
end
of
the
yawl
his
startled
comrades
saw
him
disappear
and
strove
staunchly
to
put
the
boat
about
as
the
craft
half
turned
there
was
a
shock
and
a
crash
a
giant
fish
perhaps
a
shark
had
struck
the
boat
amidships
the
craft
was
splintered
in
half
as
quick
as
a
flash
the
next
minute
the
young
aviator
and
his
companion
were
struggling
in
the
water
the
big
marine
monster
had
apparently
gone
straight
on
its
way
in
pursuit
of
a
disappearing
phosphorescent
mass
dave
grabbed
out
at
the
one
floating
half
of
the
wrecked
yawl
elmer
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
here
panted
elmer
as
he
reached
side
and
grasped
the
edge
of
the
floating
wreck
hiram
thunder
puffed
the
individual
in
question
safe
but
my
big
catch
got
away
line
and
mind
that
now
replied
dave
in
a
serious
fix
all
the
fish
in
the
boat
gone
too
mourned
hiram
dolefully
here
both
of
you
ordered
dave
decisively
waste
any
time
we
know
what
kind
of
danger
hovers
about
us
yell
and
loud
agreed
hiram
letting
out
a
terrific
warwhoop
the
others
chorused
in
dave
believed
that
their
forlorn
hail
might
have
some
effect
heard
us
cried
hiram
joyfully
here
she
comes
added
elmer
in
a
relieved
tone
the
searchlight
on
the
was
suddenly
shifted
its
broad
groping
rays
were
focussed
on
the
sea
searching
for
the
castaways
the
glowing
pencils
of
light
came
nearer
and
nearer
finally
the
full
dazzling
gleam
swept
the
wreck
and
those
clinging
to
it
and
rested
on
it
have
seen
us
declared
the
young
aviator
as
the
searchlight
maintained
a
full
focus
directly
upon
them
what
next
inquired
hiram
will
have
to
wait
and
see
replied
dave
relief
and
rescue
came
almost
magically
quick
the
larger
yawl
of
the
glided
across
the
broad
path
of
light
the
veteran
airman
the
anxious
grimshaw
and
two
others
its
occupants
ends
all
experiments
in
the
fishing
line
declared
king
is
a
wonder
some
of
those
sharks
did
not
attack
searchlight
probably
scared
them
away
suggested
grimshaw
the
adventure
furnished
a
fruitful
theme
for
discussion
when
the
boys
were
once
more
back
in
the
comfortable
cabin
of
the
airship
hiram
however
continued
to
expatiate
on
his
great
catch
and
greater
loss
bet
it
was
a
dolphin
pulled
me
out
of
the
boat
he
declared
think
of
it
a
dolphin
something
to
brag
a
storm
set
in
within
the
hour
and
the
speedily
sought
a
higher
level
all
the
boys
knew
about
it
was
what
king
told
them
the
next
morning
the
pleasing
swaying
motion
of
the
giant
craft
had
lulled
them
to
sound
and
refreshing
slumber
it
was
again
after
dark
the
next
evening
when
the
cook
came
into
the
cabin
and
looked
at
king
in
a
manner
that
made
the
airman
inquire
curiously
on
your
mind
demys
i
found
a
window
broken
in
the
room
just
beyond
the
larder
reported
the
cook
maybe
said
king
casually
know
we
had
some
last
i
know
that
replied
the
man
i
noticed
two
more
panes
of
glass
cracked
right
the
big
strain
of
the
wind
in
the
storm
last
night
weakened
them
suggested
the
airman
assented
the
cook
vaguely
thing
though
i
set
a
pan
of
beans
in
the
room
to
cool
before
supper
when
i
went
after
them
just
now
i
found
nearly
half
of
them
that
so
now
questioned
king
beginning
to
get
interested
you
suppose
it
was
rats
propounded
the
hiram
sir
declared
the
cook
definitely
have
never
noticed
a
trace
of
rats
in
the
bet
another
just
like
elmer
here
all
hands
laughed
abruptly
at
this
unique
piece
of
guesswork
reckon
i
was
the
only
intruder
aboard
hiram
remarked
elmer
the
beans
are
gone
and
somebody
ate
them
said
the
cook
be
anybody
of
the
crew
for
no
one
has
passed
through
the
galley
but
myself
and
the
room
i
speak
of
is
beyond
we
investigate
suggested
the
young
aviator
it
agreed
the
impetuous
hiram
on
all
hands
followed
the
cook
to
his
quarters
they
inspected
the
galley
and
then
entered
the
room
beyond
it
sure
enough
there
was
the
dish
of
beans
nearly
half
its
original
contents
missing
hiram
and
elmer
explored
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
place
where
there
was
the
least
opportunity
for
a
stowaway
to
hide
their
search
was
without
results
certainly
something
of
a
mystery
decided
the
young
aviator
cracked
windows
too
why
he
added
examining
them
closely
looks
as
though
some
one
had
deliberately
hammered
on
them
until
they
gave
way
as
you
there
was
another
sensation
the
next
evening
the
cook
came
rushing
into
the
cabin
king
happened
to
be
on
hand
getting
superstitious
and
scared
declared
the
cook
up
now
interrogated
the
airman
for
nerves
reported
the
man
scrapings
sort
of
low
groans
beginning
to
believe
the
airship
is
said
king
did
you
hear
these
strange
noises
you
describe
now
see
here
some
of
you
come
with
me
and
see
if
you
can
figure
this
thing
the
boys
were
ready
enough
for
the
investigation
the
cook
led
them
to
the
galley
and
they
sat
down
as
he
put
out
all
the
lights
keep
perfectly
quiet
and
listen
patiently
directed
the
young
aviator
something
spoke
hiram
in
a
hoarse
whisper
as
a
queer
cooing
sound
came
from
the
watched
room
now
he
added
and
crept
through
the
doorway
there
was
a
fluttering
sound
dave
traced
it
to
a
corner
of
the
room
where
there
were
some
boxes
the
noise
came
from
behind
them
he
groped
with
his
hand
and
his
fingers
finally
grazed
a
feathery
shrinking
object
a
light
he
called
out
instantly
caught
the
is
it
what
is
it
cried
hiram
rushing
forward
as
the
electric
lights
were
turned
on
a
pigeon
announced
dave
dragging
into
view
a
ruffled
timid
dove
your
mystery
explained
the
bird
must
have
been
driven
through
the
broken
window
during
that
storm
the
other
night
the
poor
thing
was
famished
and
ate
the
beans
then
it
cracked
the
window
panes
trying
to
get
out
got
it
dave
declared
hiram
say
what
is
that
fastened
under
its
wing
sure
enough
said
dave
observing
what
looked
like
an
oilskin
package
fastened
with
silk
cord
under
the
wing
of
the
bird
this
must
be
a
carrier
dove
we
must
see
king
about
the
airman
inspected
the
oilskin
package
he
read
a
written
enclosure
it
contained
is
a
trained
passenger
pigeon
he
said
from
rio
de
janeiro
and
carrying
a
message
to
its
former
home
in
washington
feed
up
the
bird
boys
and
send
the
brave
little
thing
again
on
its
the
next
morning
when
the
carrier
pigeon
was
set
free
started
landwards
it
bore
a
second
message
this
told
the
world
that
the
giant
airship
was
eight
hundred
miles
on
its
trip
across
the
broad

dave
they
stole
a
march
on
us
last
is
that
hiram
questioned
the
young
aviator
yes
sir
the
made
a
landing
about
midnight
on
the
beach
of
some
or
bahama
or
something
like
that

this

the
professor
says
took
on
a
fresh
supply
of
water
king
visited
the
town
nearby
and
got
some
papers
and
sent
a
message
to
the
aero
hiram
had
just
come
from
the
cabin
preceding
his
comrade
in
waking
up
by
a
few
minutes
when
the
two
friends
went
to
the
cabin
they
found
young
brackett
waiting
to
take
breakfast
with
them
a
few
days
had
made
a
marked
change
in
the
new
passenger
of
the
everybody
was
pleasant
and
encouraging
to
him
he
had
become
greatly
interested
in
the
workings
of
the
airship
dave
had
suggested
to
him
that
owing
to
the
fact
that
his
father
was
a
foremost
manufacturer
in
the
aeroplane
line
he
had
a
splendid
opportunity
to
begin
business
life
in
the
same
field
the
had
started
out
on
its
real
voyage
in
fine
shape
weather
conditions
being
perfect
so
far
except
for
the
adventure
among
the
mountain
men
of
north
carolina
not
one
adverse
incident
had
marred
the
flight
the
three
friends
chatted
and
joked
buoyantly
while
dispatching
their
appetizing
meal
young
brackett
had
picked
up
one
of
the
newspapers
brought
to
the
airship
from
the
island
just
after
midnight
he
was
looking
it
over
casually
when
he
uttered
a
quick
cry
as
of
startled
amazement
not
true
he
almost
shouted
and
he
brought
his
fist
down
upon
the
table
to
emphasize
the
remark
with
such
force
that
the
dishes
rattled
not
true
brackett
inquired
the
young
aviator
in
some
surprise
called
out
the
lad
in
considerable
excitement
and
then
he
read
from
the
newspaper
red
white
and
blue

was
picked
up
three
hundred
miles
from

by

exclaimed
hiram
the
day
we
started
they
were
hours
ahead
of
true
again
declared
young
brackett
sharply
mean
asked
dave
in
wonder
and
dawson
are
not
aboard
of
the
pshaw
now
how
can
you
say
that
challenged
the
impetuous
hiram
here
is
the
clear
evidence
seem
to
know
something
we
know
remarked
dave
with
a
close
glance
at
brackett
public
prints
announced
that
davidson
and
dawson
started
with
the
on
the
trip
across
the
atlantic
on
the
afternoon
of
the
did
nodded
brackett
saw
them
but
they
came
that
cried
hiram
they
the
no
and
the
queer
part
of
it
they
may
have
lost
their
looks
that
way
they
may
have
hired
someone
else
to
take
the
risk
of
the
trip
anyhow
they
got
out
of
the
after
leaving
senca
and
came
back
there
at
midnight
i
slept
that
night
in
the
place
where
they
had
built
the
i
saw
them
come
i
saw
them
go
you
astonish
me
said
dave
bluntly
you
sure
of
what
you
say
declared
the
lad
with
positiveness
and
dawson
came
secretly
to
the
old
aerodrome
they
had
a
big
automobile
and
loaded
into
it
a
long
box
both
were
disguised
and
i
recognized
them
only
by
their
voices
i
heard
them
speak
of
getting
to
the
steamer
how
to
explain
these
dispatches
apparently
dropped
from
the
into
the
ocean
i
know
only
told
you
what
i
do
king
must
know
of
this
said
dave
thoughtfully
no
plausible
solution
of
the
tangle
was
arrived
at
however
amid
the
sheer
exhilaration
and
activity
of
their
own
superb
flight
the
crew
of
the
soon
forgot
the
incident
surrounding
the
rival
airship
with
new
mystery
for
two
days
and
nights
the
giant
airship
made
an
even
steady
run
true
as
a
needle
to
a
set
course
there
was
a
slight
mist
over
the
waters
the
next
evening
so
fair
and
promising
was
the
weather
that
professor
leblance
had
deviated
from
the
route
he
had
first
laid
out
he
had
made
an
aerial
short
cut
the
result
was
that
they
were
somewhat
out
of
the
regular
path
of
ocean
travelers
it
was
always
a
pleasure
for
the
boys
to
watch
out
nights
for
the
steamers
far
beneath
them
that
night
grimshaw
seated
at
one
of
the
windows
remarked
in
his
usual
laconic
way
ahoy
away
chirped
the
active
hiram
who
was
priding
himself
on
becoming
quite
nautical
ahead
somewhat
to
the
see
it
said
the
young
aviator
do
i
joined
in
hiram
say
he
added
excitedly
a
minute
or
two
later
no
light
a
as
they
progressed
and
the
radiance
became
plainer
all
hands
decided
that
hiram
was
right
nearer
and
nearer
they
came
to
the
growing
light
flames
became
visible
then
the
fire
fringed
the
outlines
of
hull
and
rigging
dave
ran
to
the
pilot
room
and
quickly
advised
king
of
the
circumstance
professor
leblance
was
summoned
from
the
engine
room
down
and
focus
the
searchlight
on
the
ship
he
ordered
this
was
done
it
was
a
vivid
and
exciting
scene
the
great
fingers
of
radiance
went
groping
all
about
the
craft
no
one
seemed
aboard
no
one
seemed
struggling
in
the
waves
about
the
ship
fast
to
its
stern
however
by
a
long
cable
and
thus
held
in
position
was
a
rude
raft
the
searchlight
showed
a
man
standing
upon
this
and
viewing
the
blazing
ship
at
his
feet
covered
over
with
a
tarpaulin
there
seemed
to
be
another
human
form
can
not
leave
those
people
to
their
fate
said
the
professor
king
we
will
drop
the
floats
and
stop
while
you
and
the
boys
take
the
emergency
yawl
and
go
after
whoever
may
be
aboard
of
that
the
rested
its
floats
lightly
upon
the
water
and
skimmed
it
slowly
at
an
even
height
like
the
royal
bird
after
which
it
was
named
the
handling
of
the
yawl
was
of
a
piece
with
the
operation
of
all
the
perfect
utilities
of
the
airship
the
three
boys
took
the
oars
and
the
airman
acted
as
pilot
just
as
they
got
near
to
the
raft
they
saw
the
man
standing
upright
upon
it
sever
the
cable
holding
it
to
the
burning
ship
the
heat
from
the
flames
had
evidently
become
too
intense
for
him
to
bear
then
he
posed
in
an
attitude
of
suspense
and
eagerness
a
wiry
little
man
he
had
a
long
oval
metal
box
strapped
across
his
shoulder
and
was
dripping
wet
for
you
he
hailed
as
the
airman
grappled
the
raft
with
a
boathook
caught
fire
did
it
remarked
king
i
set
the
yawl
crew
stared
almost
unbelievingly
at
the
man
as
he
made
this
statement
but
he
went
on
calmly
had
to
water
logged
and
bound
to
sink
the
first
capful
of
breeze
that
hits
are
the
passengers
and
crew
asked
the
airman
her
early
this
morning
i
was
down
in
the
cabin
getting
the
speaker
tapped
the
tin
box
as
though
it
contained
something
precious
missed
me
and
were
away
in
the
boat
before
i
knew
the
fire
made
this
raft
ready
against
the
ship
scuttling
thought
fire
the
ship
for
a
signal
for
help
you
see
it
did
some
get
aboard
ordered
the
airman
about
him
inquired
the
shipwrecked
man
and
he
pointed
to
the
tarpaulin
on
the
raft
there
is
it
man
i
rescued
not
an
hour
ago
he
lay
across
a
wooden
grating
floating
along
past
the
ship
his
head
is
bleeding
and
he
is
king
directed
dave
and
hiram
to
assist
in
lifting
the
insensible
man
to
the
yawl
the
latter
was
limp
and
lifeless
as
some
water
logged
rat
they
placed
him
in
the
bottom
of
the
yawl
and
resumed
their
oars
here
spoke
the
man
with
the
tin
box
best
you
can
do
for
me
is
a
sky
sailor
is
it
or
nothing
replied
the
airman
are
you
bound
for
the
atlantic
for
knew
it
would
come
some
day
observed
the
rescued
man
quite
coolly
see
an
inventor
myself
got
in
that
tin
box
patents
for
a
new
kind
of
color
photography
that
will
make
me
millions
not
altogether
poor
just
now
either
and
if
you
set
me
and
my
patents
safe
on
almost
anywhere
pay
a
handsome
within
the
hour
the
rescued
men
were
hoisted
safely
into
the
airship
and
the
yawl
replaced
in
position
the
unconscious
man
had
been
carried
into
one
of
the
staterooms
professor
leblance
had
quite
a
smattering
of
medicine
he
examined
the
patient
prepared
some
remedies
from
a
medicine
chest
the
craft
carried
and
came
into
the
cabin
to
report
to
dale
very
sick
man
what
water
and
exposure
have
not
done
a
bad
cut
on
the
head
has
he
is
delirious
and
in
a
weak
and
feverish
condition
i
would
suggest
that
you
in
the
cabin
here
take
turns
in
caring
for
all
hands
were
agreeable
to
this
in
the
excitement
and
bustle
of
the
rescue
dave
and
the
others
had
not
particularly
noticed
the
sufferer
dave
had
scarcely
entered
the
place
where
the
patient
lay
however
with
hiram
when
he
gave
a
great
start
he
stood
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
man
as
he
spoke
hurriedly
to
his
comrade
to
king
and
tell
him
to
come
here
at
is

the

minutes

the

pointing
to
the
prostrate

he
ejaculated

starting
back

davidson
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
fact
in
turn
grimshaw
young
brackett
and
even
hiram
confirmed
the
identification
a
new
mystery
for
you
admitted
king
coming
into
the
cabin
an
hour
later
clothes
that
man
wore
show
little
adaptability
to
airship
work
in
one
of
his
pockets
i
found
the
main
stub
of
a
steamship
ticket
he
never
fell
from
any
airship
i
can
account
for
his
extraordinary
appearance
upon
the
scene
in
one
way
that
questioned
dale
that
he
was
lost
off
some
ocean
steamer
one
thing
never
started
across
the
atlantic
with
this
man
in
for
three
days
davidson
lay
insensible
most
of
the
time
meanwhile
the
coursed
its
way
without
accident
or
delay
all
hands
were
delighted
over
the
success
thus
far
of
their
wonderful
enterprise
they
passed
the
distance
mark
with
every
prospect
of
reaching
goal
in
splendid
trim
it
was
a
cool
cloudy
and
misty
night
and
both
the
professor
and
airman
were
on
close
guard
on
account
of
the
changed
weather
conditions
the
boys
were
reading
in
the
cozy
cabin
grimshaw
and
dale
had
gone
to
bed
and
everything
seemed
proceeding
smoothly
in
engine
and
pilot
rooms
finally
hiram
looked
up
from
his
book
are
surely
going
to
make
it

remarked

that
it

be

hardly
realize
that
there

observed
the
young
aviator
what
was
that
abruptly
interjected
young
brackett
there
had
come
a
sudden
shock
it
resembled
a
wrench
a
shiver
as
if
some
vital
part
of
the
giant
mechanism
had
met
with
disaster
wrong
cried
dave
springing
to
his
feet
at
that
moment
a
yell
echoed
through
the
airship
chapter
xxiii
the
forlorn
hope
hiram
and
brackett
joined
the
young
aviator
in
a
rush
for
the
passageway
leading
to
the
pilot
room
it
was
from
that
direction
that
the
cry
had
echoed
a
sharp
double
danger
signal
rang
out
from
the
engine
room
there
were
sounds
of
distant
shouts
the
yell
was
repeated
some
keen
intuition
drove
dave
to
the
stateroom
which
had
served
as
invalid
ward
for
the
man
rescued
from
the
raft
cried
the
young
aviator
is
gone
it
be
suppose
gone
wild
and
is
rambling
all
over
the
ship
among
that
machinery
following
upon
the
echoes
of
that
second
terrific
cry
a
disturbing
thing
had
electric
light
in
the
went
out
to
add
to
the
confusion
and
terror
of
the
moment
in
the
direction
of
the
engine
room
there
rang
out
a
thumping
crashing
sound
as
if
some
disjointed
part
of
the
machinery
was
beating
things
to
pieces
like
a
steel
flail
still
ordered
dave
sharply
try
to
grope
about
in
the
dark
no
the
young
aviator
felt
his
way
out
into
a
corridor
leading
to
the
supply
room
it
was
a
fortunate
thing
that
he
had
familiarized
himself
with
everything
about
the
place
dave
located
a
certain
cabinet
and
opening
one
of
its
drawers
took
out
what
he
was
armful
of
electric
hand
lights
carrying
their
own
batteries
hiram
brackett
he
called
flashing
one
of
the
tubes
some
of
these
follow
me
i
know
that
the
people
in
the
engine
rooms
have
any
way
of
getting
a
light
let
us
hurry
to
on
shouted
a
new
voice
and
grimshaw
bolted
upon
the
scene
the
trouble
know
but
something
pretty
serious
i
imagine
replied
dave
quickly
he
furnished
grimshaw
with
two
of
the
electric
tubes
then
dave
led
the
way
to
the
pilot
room
he
found
king
lighting
matches
to
get
some
kind
of
illumination
and
as
ignorant
themselves
as
to
the
condition
of
affairs
the
aviator
at
once
led
a
rush
in
the
direction
of
the
engine
room
they
arrived
at
the
leading
to
it
to
come
upon
a
stirring
scene
a
small
hand
lamp
only
illuminated
the
apartment
it
contained
four
men
the
professor
two
of
his
assistants
and
these
latter
were
holding
to
the
floor
and
battling
with
and
binding
hand
and
foot
a
wild
struggling
davidson
got
loose
cried
the
aviator
at
once
reading
the
situation
in
his
frenzy
has
done
terrible
damage
to
the
exclaimed
professor
leblance
pale
disturbed
and
is
very
serious
i
fear
get
him
away
to
the
cabin
as
speedily
as
you
can
and
watch
him
every
minute
you
king
resume
your
post
at
the
pilot
table
dashaway
hurry
all
the
spare
light
tubes
there
was
a
shivery
uncertain
wobble
to
the
giant
airship
now
the
prodigious
construction
resembled
some
monster
machine
that
had
received
a
vital
wound
dave
hastened
on
his
mission
as
he
returned
to
the
engine
room
he
passed
hiram
brackett
and
one
of
the
assistants
carrying
davidson
back
to
the
stateroom
king
was
at
his
post
at
the
pilot
table
and
looked
worried
and
helpless
the
electric
apparatus
of
the
airship
having
been
destroyed
he
could
only
sit
and
use
the
speaking
tubes
dave
found
the
engine
room
in
hideous
disorder
the
engine
was
not
in
operation
and
parts
of
it
were
all
out
of
order
the
professor
and
his
men
were
getting
a
reserve
engine
in
shape
for
over
an
hour
silently
and
deeply
engrossed
in
all
that
was
going
on
the
young
aviator
placed
the
light
tubes
as
directed
and
brought
this
and
that
tool
and
to
the
workmen
as
professor
leblance
ordered
dave
saw
the
new
engine
started
up
the
professor
held
a
long
whispered
conversation
with
one
of
his
men
then
he
beckoned
to
dave
and
led
the
way
to
the
pilot
room
the
frenchman
sank
into
a
chair
there
his
face
gray
and
careworn
they
were
three
anxious
ones
leblance
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
wearily
as
if
he
had
gone
through
a
terrible
ordeal
said
the
aviator
simply
maniac
threw
an
iron
bar
into
the
machinery
he
has
ruined
everything
announced
leblance
the
new
engine
only
operate
the
rudder
control
the
entire
mechanism
is
practically
destroyed
my
friends
i
must
not
conceal
from
you
that
the
situation
is
desperate
dangerous
almost
hopeless
we
are
still
running
professor
submitted
the
aviator
one
forlorn
hope
in
reaching
the
end
of
our
voyage
we
can
never
hope
for
declared
the
frenchman
in
a
gloomy
tone
bluntly
demanded
the
aviator
leblance
arose
to
his
feet
running
one
hand
over
his
eyes
with
a
swift
movement
as
if
to
restore
impaired
vision
or
brush
away
tears
he
proceeded
to
a
map
attached
to
the
wall
just
above
the
pilot
table
his
fingers
traced
the
course
already
traversed
by
the
are
here
he
said
halting
the
faltering
index
observe
is
an
island
it
is
two
hundred
miles
southwest
of
the
coast
of
france
we
may
possibly
reach
it
by
exhausting
every
utility
we
possess
if
we
do
not
within
the
next
the
professor
shrugged
his
shoulders
slowly
sadly
this
time
an
expression
of
ineffable
solemnity
crossed
his
noble
face
he
pointed
down
as
if
indicating
unknown
depths
waiting
to
swallow
them
up
then
he
again
ran
his
finger
across
the
map
pausing
at
that
little
dark
speck
that
marked
the
island
change
of
wind
he
said
single
break
in
the
apparatus
a
trifling
leak
and
we
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
mishap
of
our
lives
that
is
our
last
forlorn
hope
chapter

goal
too
bad
said
hiram
and
the
young
assistant
was
very
nearly
at
the
point
of
tears
can
only
make
the
best
of
it
returned
dave
trying
to
be
philosophical
any
rate
we
made
a
grand
something
to
beat
the
record
even
half
the
way
agreed
hiram
think
of
for
that
awful
break
of
davidson
have
won
the
day
the
two
young
airmen
sat
outside
of
a
wretched
little
hotel
a
part
of
a
remote
fishing
town
on
the
island
that
had
been
forlorn
of
the
the
giant
airship
had
succeeded
in
reaching
it
as
dave
sat
rather
gloomily
reviewing
experience
and
prospects
he
could
not
help
but
think
of
the
past
two
nights
and
a
day
with
a
thrill
that
had
been
a
desperate
dash
of
the
crippled
airship
without
knowing
all
the
technical
details
of
their
situation
dave
had
read
from
the
tireless
feverish
actions
of
professor
leblance
that
he
was
rushing
the
under
a
fearful
strain
of
risk
and
suspense
momentarily
dreading
a
new
and
final
disaster
before
daylight
with
a
flabby
gas
bag
and
with
the
reserve
engine
barely
able
to
work
the
propellers
the
had
settled
down
on
a
desolate
stretch
of
beach
practically
a
wreck
mechanism
has
played
out
completely
leblance
had
asserted
to
the
regulations
of
the
international
society
the
flight
must
end
on
the
french
or
english
mainland
we
are
two
hundred
miles
short
we
might
as
well
be
two
there
no
possible
chance
of
getting
new
machinery
of
making
temporary
repairs
that
will
tide
us
over
suggested
king
under
days
even
weeks
replied
the
frenchman
the
rule
schedule
a
stay
at
any
point
over
twelve
hours
cancels
the
right
of
it
was
indeed
too
near
to
success
so
very
close
to
goal
a
profound
gloom
had
spread
over
every
member
of
the
airship
crowd
the
islanders
had
viewed
the
strange
craft
with
excited
curiosity
at
first
and
had
then
gone
back
to
their
fishing
davidson
had
been
removed
to
a
room
at
the
little
hotel
young
brackett
in
charge
as
his
nurse
and
all
the
others
had
taken
up
their
quarters
as
well
the
young
aviator
and
his
comrade
had
been
discussing
the
situation
seated
on
an
overturned
boat
hiram
at
length
arose
with
a
dreary
kind
of
sigh
and
strolled
aimlessly
back
towards
the
hotel
dave
sat
thinking
deeply
he
started
up
however
as
he
saw
brackett
coming
towards
him
he
said
quite
excitedly
got
to
get
back
to
my
charge
dare
to
leave
him
alone
you
know
but
i
wanted
you
to
read
something
and
the
speaker
extended
some
folded
sheets
of
paper
what
is
this
inquired
the
young
aviator
know
i
understand
about
all
i
am
good
for
i
reckon
added
elmer
in
his
usual
deprecating
way
for
the
past
hour
or
two
my
patient
has
been
saying
some
strange
about
asked
and
jerry
dawson
i
suppose
guessed
it
written
out
his
ramblings
in
long
hand
i
fancy
your
quick
mind
will
weave
a
pretty
startling
story
out
of
it
the
professor
said
dave
abruptly
read
your
notes
later
brackett
and
he
thrust
the
sheets
into
his
pocket
and
started
towards
the
beach
as
he
saw
professor
leblance
leave
the
hotel
bound
in
the
same
direction
the
failure
of
the
ambitious
frenchman
had
almost
crushed
him
dave
felt
sorry
for
him
as
he
noted
the
drooping
head
and
dejected
manner
of
the
scientist
he
did
not
approach
him
closely
but
followed
him
at
a
distance
as
they
rounded
some
rocks
the
came
into
full
view
professor
leblance
walking
slowly
gazed
with
sadness
upon
the
inert
monster
of
the
air
then
he
looked
up
at
a
hail
a
fisherman
was
running
towards
him
dave
noticed
the
professor
brace
up
magically
at
the
first
words
of
the
native
the
latter
pointed
to
the
air
and
the
sea
his
pantomime
was
expressive
and
energetic
there
came
a
sudden
blast
of
wind
and
then
dave
understood
he
noticed
the
professor
start
on
a
keen
run
for
the
he
was
up
the
trailing
rope
ladder
sprightly
as
a
lad
shouting
some
orders
to
the
fisherman
who
ran
towards
the
guy
cable
attached
to
a
great
tree
trunk
be
possible
almost
gasped
the
startled
young
airman
professor
leblance
is
thinking
of
trusting
to
the
wind
alone
to
finish
the
flight
true
i
be
left
behind
dave
caught
at
the
ladder
just
as
the
propeller
began
to
whir
by
the
time
he
was
in
the
cabin
the
earth
was
fading
away
he
threaded
the
corridors
in
the
direction
of
the
engine
room
shouted
the
professor
in
amazement
as
the
young
airman
burst
in
upon
him
professor
i
am
here
said
dave
are
going
to
make
a
try
to
reach
the
mainland
i
am
with
there
was
no
time
for
compliments
explanations
or
delay
in
two
time
the
professor
had
made
his
assistant
aware
of
what
was
required
of
him
practically
only
as
a
balloon
could
the
now
act
and
only
provided
the
strong
wind
maintained
in
precisely
the
direction
it
was
now
set
my
friend
spoke
leblance
eagerly
have
no
control
whatever
over
the
planes
the
steering
apparatus
too
is
useless
the
engine
will
barely
take
care
of
the
propellers
if
you
know
how
to
operate
them
take
my
seat
here
keep
the
rudder
locked
firm
that
is
all
we
can
do
for
the
is
a
risk
a
perilous
to
get
there
cried
dave
and
then
the
professor
left
him
alone
the
had
risen
to
a
good
altitude
at
her
first
spurt
she
drove
with
the
wind
at
a
wonderful
rate
of
speed
at
the
end
of
an
hour
however
the
young
aviator
noticed
a
gradual
drop
the
buoyancy
of
the
gas
bag
was
lessening
after
that
dave
heard
the
professor
working
with
tools
below
the
cabin
he
was
quite
startled
as
there
was
a
jerk
then
he
saw
first
one
and
then
the
other
of
the
aeroplane
attachments
go
hurtling
down
to
the
water
engulfed
by
the
ocean
relieved
of
such
an
incubus
the
airship
regained
a
higher
level
two
hours
went
by
then
three
the
professor
appeared
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
and
hopefulness
dropping
again
but
let
up
for
an
instant
he
ordered
see
the
land
hours
more
and
made
the
gas
last
inquired
the
young
aviator
seriously
am
about
to
free
our
final
tank
that
will
do
for
a
spell
i
have
to
explode
the
balloonets
into
the
main
gas
chamber
we
must
keep
aloft
till
we
are
over
was
the
progress
for
the
next
two
hours
once
it
was
nearly
a
volplane
drift
and
the
dauntless
young
pilot
of
the
fancied
they
were
headed
for
a
dive
straight
into
the
depths
a
final
rise
and
heart
cheered
as
he
saw
land
not
two
miles
distant
professor
leblance
rushed
into
the
engine
room
he
her
drop
as
she
likes
have
arrived
the
brave
old
scientist
tottered
from
excitement
and
exhaustion
as
he
spoke
a
great
thrilling
cheer
seemed
to
lift
from
the
lips
of
the
young
aviator
and
ten
minutes
later
the
a
wobbling
flabby
wreck
landed
on
a
great
dock
in
the
sight
of
waiting
thousands
spoke
professor
leblance
in
a
ringing
tone
and
with
sparkling
eyes
have
reached
goal
the
giant
airship
has
crossed
the
atlantic
chapter
xxv
conclusion
is
professor
leblance
i
believe
we
have
been
expecting
you
this
is
my
friend
and
david
dashaway
spoke
the
french
scientist
proudly
it
was
hours
after
the
giant
airship
had
landed
on
french
soil
within
that
space
of
time
rapid
and
interesting
events
had
been
crowded
into
the
experience
of
the
young
american
aviator
at
once
after
the
landing
the
professor
had
sought
out
the
nearest
resident
representative
of
the
french
aero
association
this
individual
had
officially
verified
the
arrival
of
the
armed
with
the
necessary
credentials
leblance
and
his
young
assistant
had
started
at
once
for
london
their
destination
now
reached
was
the
international
aero
institute
with
whom
negotiations
had
been
made
before
the
started
on
its
trip
the
french
official
had
wired
about
the
coming
of
the
distinguished
visitors
now
dave
dashaway
like
the
professor
arrayed
in
a
handsome
new
suit
of
clothes
stood
in
the
office
of
one
of
the
most
noted
organizations
in
the
aero
world
the
first
flush
of
the
recent
triumph
still
dwelt
with
dave
then
there
flashed
over
his
mind
the
marvelous
contrast
between
the
present
moment
and
less
than
six
months
previous
then
he
had
been
the
obscure
ward
of
a
cruel
guardian
now
through
a
mist
of
grateful
tears
the
young
aviator
thought
tenderly
of
the
right
royal
friends
who
had
assisted
in
crossing
the
atlantic
in
the
giant
airship
and
who
had
loyally
helped
him
to
become
the
honored
guest
of
men
famous
the
world
over
for
science
and
intelligent
adventure
the
secretary
of
the
club
who
had
greeted
them
stood
aside
with
a
courteous
bow
to
usher
them
into
the
reception
room
of
the
club
as
he
did
so
he
said
are
proud
to
greet
you
professor
your
exploit
will
live
in
history
notwithstanding
that
you
are
second
in
the
remarkable
feat
of
crossing
the
atlantic
in
an
the
sensitive
frenchman
recoiled
as
though
dealt
a
blow
he
cried
sharply
what
does
this
mean
had
not
heard
ah
yes
the
pilot
dawson
landed
near
plymouth
day
before
yesterday
after
a
terrible
trip
clinging
to
the
mere
rag
of
a
gas
bag
dawson
was
found
nearly
drowned
on
the
professor
leblance
sank
to
a
chair
stupefied
he
stared
like
a
man
stunned
into
vacancy
he
was
completely
overcome
a
strange
expression
crossed
the
face
of
the
young
aviator
impulsively
his
hand
went
to
a
certain
document
that
elmer
brackett
had
given
him
two
days
before
his
eye
grew
more
steady
his
lips
more
firm
you
kindly
give
me
a
few
details
of
the
flight
he
requested
professor
leblance
recovers
from
his
surprise
it
was
a
brief
story
the
red
white
and
blue
gas
bag
had
landed
near
plymouth
the
daring
pilot
was
discovered
clinging
to
it
drenched
to
the
skin
he
had
been
feted
honored
brought
to
london
he
was
even
now
in
the
next
room
relating
his
wonderful
adventures
to
the
president
and
directors
of
the
club
professor
leblance
said
dave
in
a
clear
steady
tone
have
something
to
say
to
this
wonderful
leblance
and
dashaway
of
the
introduced
the
secretary
a
minute
later
lolling
in
a
luxurious
armchair
in
the
midst
of
some
braggadocio
recital
with
a
startled
jerk
jerry
dawson
came
upright
as
though
electrified
the
eye
of
the
young
aviator
rested
upon
him
with
a
fixedness
that
made
him
squirm
to
meet
you
professor
leblance
greeted
the
club
official
share
a
most
glorious
exploit
with
our
word
first
interrupted
dave
amazed
at
his
own
firmness
of
voice
and
nerve
there
may
be
no
later
misunderstanding
does
that
young
man
whom
i
recognize
as
a
dawson
claim
to
have
arrived
first
in
the
race
across
the
atlantic
assuredly
responded
the
club
president
claim
is
unfounded
declared
the
young
aviator
in
a
calm
even
tone
but
with
great
positiveness
is
an
adventurer
a
fraud
he
crossed
the
atlantic
on
the
steamer
the
balloon
found
on
the
plymouth
coast
is
a
duplicate
of
the
which
he
brought
along
with
him
and
the
original
after
a
brief
land
run
was
purposely
burned
up
fifty
miles
from
new
york
says
so
shouted
jerry
dawson
getting
excitedly
to
his
feet
davidson
replied
the
young
aviator
simply
jerry
dawson
grew
white
to
the
lips
he
foresaw
the
losing
game
but
still
he
blurted
out
proofs
said
dave
cablegram
will
serve
to
order
an
investigation
of
the
ashes
of
the
a
living
witness
as
to
the
shipboard
experience
of
this
young
romancer
can
be
brought
to
london
as
soon
as
our
friends
are
if
this
is
true
the
club
will
be
the
laughing
stock
of
the
world
observed
the
president
bending
a
dark
look
on
jerry
think
go
and
consult
a
lawyer
about
this
insulting
charge
ventured
jerry
me
we
will
kick
you
out
if
this
is
all
true
shouted
an
angry
director
will
remain
here
said
the
president
firmly
story
sir
the
truthful
one
or
we
shall
hold
you
criminally
for
false
jerry
was
scared
resolute
face
daunted
him
most
of
all
he
trembled
and
shivered
by
degrees
he
confessed
he
was
taken
to
the
office
of
the
club
to
furnish
a
signed
statement
then
he
was
turned
loose
on
the
streets
of
ingloriously
jerry
dawson
the
invalid
wanderings
of
davidson
had
supplied
his
nurse
elmer
brackett
with
a
pretty
clear
history
of
the
plot
to
impose
a
duplicate
on
the
public
while
under
the
influence
of
a
drug
davidson
had
fallen
from
the
steamer
and
jerry
had
thrown
a
grating
after
him
perhaps
the
hope
of
securing
all
the
international
prize
money
for
himself
had
led
jerry
to
say
nothing
further
about
the
accident
there
was
a
great
celebration
at
a
noted
london
hotel
the
week
following
the
most
humble
member
of
the
crew
of
the
was
present
money
and
fame
had
come
to
them
all
dave
dashaway
was
the
central
figure
with
the
public
professor
leblance
seemed
to
take
most
pride
in
the
construction
of
the
young
enterprising
popular
dave
as
the
last
man
at
the
helm
of
the
was
the
real
hero
of
the
event
lads
said
the
happy
professor
leblance
across
the
table
to
dave
hiram
and
elmer
have
now
reached
so
high
a
notch
in
aeronautic
science
that
you
can
go
no
piped
up
the
irrepressible
hiram
yes
a
grave
mistake
professor
insisted
young
brackett
dave
dashaway
only
smiled
up
with
you
young
people
challenged
the
king
spoke
the
young
aviator
we
go
back
home
and
you
have
put
that
promised
quietus
on
that
rascal
vernon
we
are
going
to
father
and
have
him
build
for
us
a
magnificent
aeroplane
that
will
beat
anything
ever
before
the
purpose
inquired
old
grimshaw
with
a
hopeful
twinkle
in
his
eye
replied
dave
idea
is
to
get
up
a
great
international
race
around
the
it
jubilated
the
veteran
airman
knew
it
would
be
something
grand

dave
dashaway
it
be
done

the
was

in
crossing

mighty
know
that
but
to
go
around
the

you
will
meet
all

of
strange
people
and
get
in
many

situation
dave
dashaway
can
do

dave
cried
hiram
