jacobs
because
he
liked
it
small
decoration
a
dog
day
or
the
angel
in
the
house
woke
up
feeling
rather
below
par
owing
to
disturbed
rest
hardly
enough
energy
to
stretch
myself
in
the
middle
of
the
night
a
strange
man
came
in
by
the
kitchen
window
very
quietly
with
a
bag
i
chummed
up
to
him
at
once
he
was
nice
to
me
and
i
was
nice
to
him
he
got
me
down
a
piece
of
meat
that
i
could
not
reach
myself
while
i
was
engaged
on
this
he
took
a
whole
lot
of
silver
things
and
put
them
into
the
bag
then
as
he
was
leaving
the
believe
now
it
was
an
on
my
toe
making
me
yelp
with
pain
i
bit
him
heartily
and
he
dropped
his
bag
and
scurried
off
through
the
window
again
my
yelping
soon
woke
up
the
whole
house
and
in
a
very
short
time
old
brown
and
young
brown
appear
they
at
once
spot
the
bag
of
silver
they
then
declare
i
have
saved
the
house
and
make
no
end
of
fuss
with
me
i
am
a
hero
later
on
miss
brown
came
down
and
fondled
me
lots
and
kissed
me
and
tied
a
piece
of
pink
ribbon
round
my
neck
and
made
me
look
a
fool
the
good
of
ribbon
i
should
like
to
know
the
most
beastly
tasting
stuff
there
ever
was

hateful
business
put
into
a
tub
and
rubbed
all
tail
and
filthy
soapy
water
that
loathsome
cat
looking
on
all
the
while
and
sneering
in
her
dashed
superior
way
i
know
i
am
sure
why
the
hussy
should
be
so
conceited
she
has
to
clean
herself
i
keep
a
servant
to
clean
me
at
the
same
time
i
often
wish
i
was
a
black
dog
they
keep
clean
so
much
longer
every
shows
up
so
frightfully
on
the
white
part
of
me
i
am
a
sight
after
cook
has
been
stroking
me
showed
myself
in
my
washed
state
to
the
family
all
very
nice
to
me
quite
a
triumphal
entry
in
fact
it
is
simply
wonderful
the
amount
of
kudos
got
from
that
incident
with
the
man
miss
brown
whom
i
rather
like
particularly
enthusiastic
kissed
me
again
and
again
and
called
me
dear
clean
brave
little

a
visitor
was
being
let
in
at
the
i
rushed
out
and
had
the
most
glorious
roll
in
the
mud
felt
more
like
my
old
self
then
visited
the
family
again
shrieks
of
horror
on
seeing
me
caked
in
mud
but
all
agreed
that
i
was
not
to
be
scolded
as
i
was
a
hero
over
the
man
all
that
is
except
aunt
brown
whose
hand
for
some
reason
or
other
is
always
against
nothing
is
too
good
for
the
cat
she
stigmatised
me
quite
gratuitously
as
horrid

great
pleading

guessed
it
they
are
irresistible
she
gives
me
a
piece
of
pudding

better
think
i
shall
pull
through
if
i
am
careful
almost
well
again
quite
well
again
thank
heavens
it
was
a
narrow
shave
that
time
people
ought
not
to
leave
such
stuff
about
up
into
and
to
show
how
well
i
am
i
gallumph
round
and
round
the
room
at
full
pelt
about
twenty
times
steering
myself
by
my
tail
then
as
a
grand
finale
i
jump
twice
on
to
the
of
old
brown
who
is
sleeping
peacefully
in
the
he
wakes
up
very
angry
indeed
and
uses
words
i
have
never
heard
before
even
miss
brown
to
my
no
little
surprise
says
it
is
very
naughty
of
me
old
brown
insists
on
my
being
punished
and
orders
miss
brown
to
beat
me
miss
brown
runs
the
burglar
for
all
he
is
worth
but
no
good
old
brown
is
dead
to
all
decent
feeling
illustration
so
miss
brown
beats
me
very
nice
thoroughly
enjoyable
just
like
being
patted
but
of
course
i
yelp
and
pretend
it
hurts
frightfully
and
do
the
business
and
she
soon
leaves
off
and
takes
me
into
the
next
room
and
gives
me
six
pieces
of
sugar
good
business
must
remember
always
to
do
this
before
leaving
she
kisses
me
and
explains
that
i
should
not
have
jumped
on
poor
pa
as
he
is
the
man
who
goes
to
the
city
to
earn
bones
for
me

not
that
odious
aunt
brown
come
in

interfered
i
did
not
say
anything

her
such
a

the

a
few
flowers

a

beastly
illustration
then
into

very
tidy

i

but
without
much
relish
i
am
off
my
feed
ate
supper
but
i
do
wish
they
would
not
give
them
that
eternal
fish
i
am
getting
sick
of
it
sick
of
it
in
the
garden
nasty
feeling
of
lassitude
comes
over
me
with
loss
of
all
initiative
so
i
decide
to
take
things
quietly
and
lie
down
by
the
kitchen
fire
sometimes
i
think
that
i
am
not
the
dog
that
i
was
hooray
appetite
returning
ravenous
have
one
of
the
nicest
pieces
of
coal
i
have
ever
come
across
illustration
nose
around
the
kitchen
floor
and
glean
a
bit
of
onion
an
imitation
comb
a
shrimp
almost
entire
an
abominably
stale
chunk
of
bread
and
about
half
a
yard
of
capital
string
after
coal
i
think
i
like
string
best
the
family
have
noticed
what
a
lot
of
this
i
stow
away
and
it
was
not
a
bad
idea
of
young
the
other
day
that
if
i
had
the
end
of
a
piece
of
string
always
hanging
from
my
mouth
they
could
use
me
as
a
though
it
is
scarcely
a
matter
for
joking
about
still
it
made
me
laugh
if
one
had
to
rely
on
other
people
one
might
starve
fortunately
in
the
hall
i
happen
on
the
and
i
get
first
look
in
lap
up
the
treacle
and
leave
the
suet
for
the
family
illustration
down
into
the
kitchen
again
sit
by
the
fire
and
pretend
i
know
what
treacle
is
like
but
that
vile
cat
is
there
and
i
believe
she
looking
round
at
me
with
her
hateful
superior
look
dash
her
what
right
has
she
got
to
give
herself
such
airs
not
half
my
size
and
pays
no
taxes
dash
her
smugness
dash
her
altogether
the
sight
of
her
maddens
when
her
back
is
turned
i
rush
at
her
and
bite
her
the
crafty
coward
wags
her
tail
pretending
she
likes
it
so
i
do
it
again
and
then
she
rounds
on
me
and
scratches
my
paw
viciously
drawing
blood
and
making
me
howl
with
pain
this
brings
miss
brown
down
in
a
hurry
she
kisses
me
tells
the
cat
she
is
a
naughty
cat
have
killed
her
for
it
gives
me
some
sugar
and
