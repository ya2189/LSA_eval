natures
languish
incomplete
something
obtuse
in
this
our

the

but
a
glory
moves
us
from
afar
and

i
behold
the
face
of
her
whose
actions
all
had
the
character
of
an
inexpressible
charm
expressed
whose
movements
flowed
from
a
centre
of
rest
and
whose
rest
was
that
of
a
swallow
rife
with
the
instinct
of
reposing
life
whose
mirth
had
a
sadness
all
the
while
it
sparkled
and
laughed
and
whose
sadness
lay
in
the
heaven
of
such
a
crystal
smile
that
you
longed
to
travel
the
way
to
the
brightness
of
sorrow
for
round
her
breathed
a
grace
like
that
of
the
general
air
which
softens
the
sharp
extremes
of
things
and
connects
by
its
subtle
invisible
stair
the
lowest
and
the
highest
she
interwreathed
her
mortal
obscureness
with
so
much
light
of
the
world
unrisen
that
wings
could
hardly
have
given
her
greater
right
to

i
lie
you
always
were
a
liar
and
you
always
will
be
a
liar
you
told
my
father
how
i
spent
the
and
what
if
i
did
i
had
to
look
after
myself
i
suppose
you
forget
that
i
am
only
here
on
sufferance
whilst
you
are
the
son
of
the
house
it
does
not
matter
to
you
but
he
would
have
turned
me
out
of
doors
whined
george
curse
your
fine
words
you
who
forget
you
swab
ay
you
who
forget
that
you
asked
me
to
take
the
money
to
the
tent
and
made
me
promise
that
you
should
have
half
of
what
we
won
but
that
i
should
play
for
both
what
are
you
beginning
to
remember
it
coming
back
to
you
after
a
whole
month
i
am
going
to
quicken
your
memory
up
presently
i
can
tell
you
i
have
got
a
good
deal
to
pay
off
thinking
i
know
what
you
are
at
you
want
to
play
cuckoo
to
turn
out
that
may
fill
the
nest
you
know
the
old
soft
points
and
you
keep
working
him
up
against
me
you
think
that
you
would
like
the
old
place
when
and
i
daresay
that
you
will
get
it
before
you
have
done
but
i
mean
to
have
my
out
of
you
now
at
any
rate
and
brushing
the
tears
of
anger
that
stood
in
his
brown
eyes
away
with
the
back
of
his
hand
the
speaker
proceeded
to
square
up
to
george
in
a
most
determined
way
now
philip
with
his
broad
shoulders
and
his
frame
would
even
at
eighteen
have
been
no
mean
antagonist
for
a
man
much
more
then
did
he
look
formidable
to
the
lankly
overgrown
stripling
crouching
against
the
corner
of
the
wall
that
prevented
his
further
retreat
not
going
to
strike
me
are
you
when
you
know
you
are
so
much
stronger
i
am
though
if
i
match
you
with
my
tongue
at
any
rate
i
will
use
my
fists
look
philip
tell
your
him
why
of
course
you
will
i
know
that
but
you
shall
have
something
to
lie
about
this
time
and
he
advanced
to
the
attack
with
a
grim
determination
not
pleasant
for
his
cousin
to
behold
finding
that
there
was
no
escape
george
turned
upon
him
with
so
shrill
a
curse
that
it
even
frightened
from
his
leafy
perch
in
the
oak
above
the
tame
intensely
preoccupied
as
he
was
in
cooing
to
a
mate
he
did
more
than
curse
he
fought
like
a
cornered
rat
and
with
as
much
chance
as
the
rat
with
a
trained
in
a
few
seconds
his
head
was
as
snugly
tucked
away
in
the
chancery
of
his
arm
as
ever
any
property
was
in
the
court
of
that
name
and
to
speak
truth
it
seemed
quite
possible
that
when
it
emerged
from
its
retreat
it
would
like
the
property
be
much
dilapidated
and
extensively
bled
let
us
not
dwell
upon
the
scene
for
george
it
was
a
very
painful
one
so
painful
that
he
never
quite
forgot
it
his
nose
too
was
never
so
straight
again
it
was
soon
over
though
to
one
of
the
parties
time
went
with
unnatural
slowness
i
think
had
about
enough
for
once
soliloquized
philip
as
he
critically
surveyed
the
writhing
mass
on
the
ground
before
him
and
he
looked
a
very
handsome
lad
as
he
said
it
his
curly
black
hair
hung
in
waving
confusion
over
his
forehead
and
flung
changing
lights
and
shadows
into
the
depths
of
his
brown
eyes
whilst
his
massive
and
somewhat
heavy
features
were
touched
into
a
more
active
life
by
the
light
of
that
pleasing
excitement
which
animates
nine
men
out
of
every
ten
of
the
race
when
they
are
engaged
on
killing
or
hurting
some
other
living
creature
the
face
too
had
a
certain
dignity
about
it
a
little
of
the
dignity
of
justice
it
was
the
face
of
one
who
feels
that
if
his
action
has
been
precipitate
and
severe
it
has
at
any
rate
been
virtuous
the
full
but
lips
also
had
their
own
expression
on
them
half
serious
half
comical
humour
contempt
and
even
pity
were
blended
in
it
altogether
philip
appearance
in
the
moment
of
boyish
vengeance
was
pleasing
and
not
uninteresting
presently
however
something
of
the
same
change
passed
over
his
face
that
we
see
in
the
sky
when
a
cloud
passes
over
the
sun
the
light
faded
out
of
it
it
was
astonishing
to
note
how
dull
and
more
how
bad
it
made
him
look
all
in
a
breath
will
be
a
pretty
business
about
this
he
murmured
and
then
administering
a
sharp
kick
to
the
prostrate
and
groaning
form
on
the
ground
before
him
he
said
then
get
up
not
going
to
touch
you
again
perhaps
though
you
be
in
quite
such
a
hurry
to
tell
lies
about
me
another
time
though
i
suppose
that
one
must
always
expect
a
certain
amount
of
lying
from
a
beggar
like
you
like
mother
like
son
you
this
last
sentence
was
accompanied
by
a
bitter
laugh
and
produced
a
decided
effect
on
the
grovelling
george
who
slowly
raised
himself
upon
his
hands
and
lifting
his
head
looked
his
cousin
full
in
the
face
it
was
not
the
ghastly
appearance
of
his
mangled
and
countenance
that
made
philip
recoil
so
sharply
from
the
sight
of
his
own
had
fought
too
often
at
school
to
be
about
a
little
bloodshed
and
besides
he
knew
that
his
cousin
was
only
knocked
about
not
really
rather
the
intense
and
almost
devilish
malignity
of
the
expression
that
hovered
on
the
blurred
features
and
in
the
eyes
but
no
attempt
was
made
by
george
to
translate
the
look
into
words
and
indeed
philip
felt
that
it
was
untranslatable
he
also
felt
dimly
that
the
hate
and
malice
with
which
he
was
regarded
by
the
individual
at
his
feet
was
of
a
more
concentrated
and
enduring
character
than
most
men
have
the
power
to
originate
in
the
lurid
light
of
that
one
glance
he
was
able
though
he
was
not
very
clever
to
pierce
the
darkest
recesses
of
his
heart
and
to
see
his
inmost
thought
no
longer
through
a
veil
but
face
to
face
and
what
he
saw
was
sufficient
to
make
the
blood
leave
his
ruddy
cheek
and
to
fix
his
eyes
into
an
expression
of
fear
next
second
george
dropped
his
head
on
to
the
ground
again
and
began
to
moan
in
an
ostentatious
manner
possibly
in
order
to
attract
some
one
whose
footsteps
could
be
plainly
heard
proceeding
slowly
down
a
on
the
other
side
of
the
yard
wall
at
any
rate
that
was
the
effect
produced
for
next
moment
before
philip
could
think
of
escape
had
he
wished
to
escape
a
door
in
the
wall
was
opened
and
a
gentleman
pausing
on
the
threshold
surveyed
the
whole
scene
with
the
assistance
of
a
with
some
evident
surprise
and
little
apparent
satisfaction
the
old
gentleman
for
he
was
old
made
so
pretty
a
picture
framed
as
he
was
in
the
arched
doorway
and
set
off
by
a
natural
background
of
varying
shades
of
green
that
his
general
appearance
is
worth
sketching
as
he
stood
to
begin
with
he
was
dressed
in
the
fashion
of
the
commencement
of
this
century
and
as
has
been
said
old
though
it
was
difficult
to
say
how
old
indeed
so
vigorous
and
comparatively
youthful
was
his
bearing
that
he
was
generally
taken
to
be
considerably
under
seventy
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
but
a
few
years
short
of
eighty
he
was
extremely
tall
over
six
feet
and
stood
upright
as
a
lifeguardsman
indeed
his
height
and
stately
carriage
would
alone
have
made
him
a
man
had
there
been
nothing
else
unusual
about
him
but
as
it
happened
his
features
were
as
uncommon
as
his
person
they
were
and
cast
in
a
noble
mould
the
nose
was
large
and
aquiline
the
chin
like
his
son
square
and
determined
but
it
was
his
eyes
that
gave
a
painful
fascination
to
his
countenance
they
were
steely
blue
and
glittered
under
the
of
his
thick
eyebrows
that
in
striking
contrast
to
the
of
his
hair
were
black
in
hue
as
tempered
steel
glitters
in
a
curtained
room
it
was
those
eyes
in
conjunction
with
sundry
little
peculiarities
of
temper
that
had
earned
for
the
old
man
the
title
of
caresfoot
a
sobriquet
in
which
he
took
peculiar
pride
so
pleased
was
he
with
it
indeed
that
he
caused
it
to
be
engraved
in
solid
oak
letters
an
inch
long
upon
the
form
of
a
and
portrait
of
himself
that
hung
over
the
staircase
in
the
house
am
determined
he
would
say
to
his
son
be
known
to
my
posterity
as
i
was
known
to
my
contemporaries
the
picture
represents
my
person
not
inaccurately
from
the
nickname
my
descendants
will
be
able
to
gather
what
the
knaves
and
fools
with
whom
i
lived
thought
of
my
character
ah
boy
i
am
wearing
out
people
will
soon
be
staring
at
that
portrait
and
wondering
if
it
was
like
me
in
a
very
few
years
i
shall
no
longer
be
but
and
he
would
chuckle
at
his
grim
and
joke
philip
felt
his
eyes
playing
upon
him
and
shrunk
from
them
his
face
had
at
the
mere
thought
of
the
consequences
of
his
chastisement
of
his
cousin
lost
the
beauty
and
animation
that
had
clothed
it
a
minute
before
now
it
grew
leaden
and
hard
the
good
died
away
from
it
altogether
and
instead
of
a
young
god
bright
with
vengeance
there
was
nothing
but
a
sullen
youth
with
dull
and
frightened
eyes
to
his
son
as
to
most
people
who
came
under
his
influence
caresfoot
was
a
grave
reality
presently
the
picture
in
the
doorway
opened
its
mouth
and
spoke
in
a
singularly
measured
gentle
voice
will
forgive
me
philip
for
interrupting
your
but
may
i
ask
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
philip
returned
no
answer
your
cousin
is
not
in
a
communicative
mood
george
perhaps
you
will
inform
me
why
you
are
lying
on
your
face
and
groaning
in
that
unpleasant
and
aggressive
manner
george
lifted
his
face
from
the
stones
and
looking
at
his
uncle
groaned
louder
than
ever
i
ask
you
philip
if
george
has
fallen
down
and
hurt
himself
or
if
there
has
been
between
you
here
george
himself
got
up
and
before
philip
could
make
any
reply
addressed
himself
to
his
uncle
he
said
will
answer
for
philip
there
been
an
altercation
and
he
in
the
scuffle
knocked
me
down
and
i
confess
here
he
put
his
hand
up
to
his
battered
face
i
am
suffering
a
good
deal
but
what
i
want
to
say
is
that
i
beg
you
will
not
blame
philip
he
thought
that
i
had
wronged
him
and
though
i
am
quite
innocent
and
could
easily
have
cleared
myself
had
he
given
me
a
chance
i
must
admit
that
appearances
are
to
a
certain
extent
against
lies
broke
in
philip
sullenly
will
wonder
sir
went
on
the
george
i
allowed
myself
to
be
drawn
into
such
a
brutal
affair
and
one
so
discreditable
to
your
house
i
can
only
say
that
i
am
very
sorry
which
indeed
he
that
i
should
never
have
taken
any
notice
of
his
that
he
would
regret
them
on
he
not
in
an
unguarded
moment
allowed
himself
to
taunt
me
with
my
birth
uncle
you
know
the
misfortune
of
my
marriage
and
that
she
was
not
his
equal
in
birth
but
you
know
too
that
she
was
my
mother
and
i
love
her
memory
though
i
never
saw
her
and
i
could
not
bear
to
hear
her
spoken
of
like
that
and
i
struck
him
i
hope
that
both
you
and
he
will
forgive
me
i
can
not
say
any
lies
again
he
can
not
speak
the
will
you
allow
me
to
point
out
remarked
his
father
in
his
blandest
voice
the
continued
repetition
of
the
very
ugly
word
is
neither
narrative
nor
argument
perhaps
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
your
side
of
the
story
you
know
i
always
wish
to
be
perfectly
lied
to
you
this
morning
about
the
money
true
enough
that
i
gambled
away
the
ten
pounds
at
roxham
fair
instead
of
paying
it
into
the
bank
as
you
told
me
but
he
persuaded
me
to
it
and
he
was
to
have
shared
the
profits
if
we
won
i
was
a
blackguard
but
he
was
a
bigger
blackguard
why
should
i
have
all
the
blame
and
have
that
fellow
continually
shoved
down
my
throat
as
a
saint
and
so
i
thrashed
him
and
that
is
all
about
i
am
sorry
to
contradict
philip
but
indeed
he
is
in
error
the
recollection
of
what
took
place
has
escaped
him
i
could
if
necessary
bring
forward
is
no
need
george
for
you
to
continue
and
then
fixing
his
glittering
eye
on
philip
is
very
melancholy
for
me
having
only
one
son
to
know
him
to
be
such
a
brute
such
a
bearer
of
false
witness
such
an
impostor
as
you
are
do
you
know
that
i
have
just
seen
bellamy
the
head
clerk
at
the
bank
and
inquired
if
he
knew
anything
of
what
happened
about
that
ten
pounds
and
do
you
know
what
he
told
me
i
and
i
want
i
really
must
beg
your
attention
he
told
me
that
the
day
following
the
fair
your
cousin
george
came
to
the
bank
with
ten
pounds
and
told
him
how
you
had
spent
the
ten
pounds
i
gave
you
to
pay
in
and
that
he
brought
the
money
his
own
savings
to
replace
what
you
had
gambled
away
and
bellamy
added
that
under
all
the
circumstances
he
did
not
feel
justified
in
placing
it
to
my
credit
what
have
you
to
say
to
that
have
i
to
say
i
have
to
say
that
i
believe
a
word
of
it
if
george
had
meant
to
do
me
a
good
turn
he
would
have
paid
the
money
in
and
said
nothing
to
bellamy
about
it
why
you
trust
me
a
little
more
father
i
tell
you
that
you
are
turning
me
into
a
scoundrel
i
am
being
twisted
up
into
a
net
of
lies
till
i
am
obliged
to
lie
myself
to
keep
clear
of
ruin
i
know
what
this
sneak
is
at
he
wants
to
work
you
into
cutting
me
out
of
the
property
which
should
be
mine
by
right
he
knows
your
weaknesses
weaknesses
thundered
his
father
striking
his
cane
on
to
the
stones
do
you
mean
by
that
uncle
he
meant
nothing
broke
in
george
nothing
then
for
an
idle
speech
it
is
one
that
may
cost
him
dear
look
you
here
philip
caresfoot
i
know
very
well
that
our
family
has
been
quite
as
remarkable
for
its
vices
as
its
virtues
but
for
the
last
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
we
have
been
gentlemen
and
you
are
not
a
gentleman
we
have
not
been
thieves
and
you
have
proved
yourself
a
thief
we
have
spoken
the
truth
and
you
are
what
you
are
so
fond
of
calling
your
cousin
who
is
worth
two
of
you
a
liar
now
listen
however
imperious
i
may
have
grown
in
my
old
age
i
can
still
respect
the
man
who
thwarts
me
even
though
i
hate
him
but
i
despise
the
man
who
deceives
me
as
i
despise
you
my
dear
son
i
tell
you
this
and
i
beg
you
to
lay
it
to
heart
that
if
ever
again
i
find
that
you
have
deceived
me
by
heaven
i
will
disinherit
you
in
favour
oh
and
the
old
man
fell
back
against
the
grey
wall
pressing
his
hands
to
his
breast
and
with
the
cold
perspiration
starting
on
to
his
pallid
countenance
both
the
lads
sprang
forward
but
before
they
reached
him
he
had
recovered
himself
is
nothing
he
said
in
his
ordinary
gentle
voice
trifling
indisposition
i
wish
you
both
good
morning
and
beg
you
to
bear
my
words
in
when
he
was
fairly
gone
george
came
up
to
his
cousin
and
laid
his
hand
upon
his
arm
do
you
insist
upon
quarrelling
with
me
philip
it
always
ends
like
this
you
always
get
the
worst
of
but
only
reply
was
to
shake
him
roughly
off
and
to
vanish
through
the
door
towards
the
lake
george
regarded
his
departing
form
with
a
peculiar
smile
which
was
rendered
even
more
peculiar
by
the
distortion
of
his
swollen
features
chapter
ii
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
any
study
that
would
prove
more
fascinating
in
itself
or
more
instructive
in
its
issues
than
the
examination
of
the
leading
characteristics
of
individual
families
as
displayed
through
a
series
of
generations
but
it
is
a
subject
that
from
its
very
nature
is
more
or
less
unapproachable
since
it
is
but
little
that
we
know
even
of
our
immediate
ancestors
occasionally
in
glancing
at
the
cracking
squares
of
canvas
many
of
which
can
not
even
boast
a
name
but
which
alone
remain
to
speak
of
the
real
and
active
life
the
joys
and
griefs
the
sins
and
virtues
that
centred
in
the
originals
of
those
hard
daubs
and
of
ourselves
we
may
light
upon
a
face
that
about
six
generations
since
was
the
counterpart
of
the
little
boy
upon
our
shoulder
or
the
daughter
standing
at
our
side
in
the
same
way
too
partly
through
tradition
and
partly
by
other
means
we
are
sometimes
able
to
trace
in
ourselves
and
in
our
children
the
strong
development
of
characteristics
that
distinguished
the
race
centuries
ago
if
local
tradition
and
such
records
of
their
individual
lives
as
remained
are
worthy
of
any
faith
it
is
beyond
a
doubt
that
the
caresfoots
of
bratham
abbey
had
handed
down
their
own
hard
and
peculiar
cast
of
character
from
father
to
son
unaffected
in
the
main
by
the
continual
introduction
of
alien
blood
on
the
side
of
the
mother
the
history
of
the
caresfoot
family
had
nothing
remarkable
about
it
they
had
been
yeomen
at
bratham
from
time
immemorial
perhaps
ever
since
the
village
had
become
a
geographical
fact
but
it
was
on
the
dissolution
of
the
monasteries
that
they
first
became
of
any
importance
in
the
county
bratham
abbey
which
had
shared
the
common
fate
was
granted
by
henry
viii
to
a
certain
courtier
sir
charles
varry
by
name
for
two
years
the
owner
never
came
near
his
new
possession
but
one
day
he
appeared
in
the
village
and
riding
to
the
house
of
farmer
caresfoot
which
was
its
most
respectable
tenement
he
begged
him
to
show
him
the
abbey
house
and
the
lands
attached
it
was
a
dark
november
afternoon
and
by
the
time
the
farmer
and
his
wearied
guest
had
crossed
the
soaked
lands
and
reached
the
great
grey
house
the
damps
and
shadows
of
the
night
had
begun
to
curtain
it
and
to
render
its
appearance
forsaken
as
it
was
inexpressibly
dreary
and
lonesome
here
my
friend
is
it
not
said
sir
charles
with
a
shudder
looking
towards
the
lake
into
which
the
rain
was
splashing
are
right
it
lonely
too
now
that
the
old
monks
have
but
they
do
say
that
the
house
be
mostly
full
of
the
spirits
of
the
dead
and
the
yeoman
sank
his
voice
to
an
awed
whisper
sir
charles
crossed
himself
and
muttered
can
well
believe
it
and
then
addressing
his
do
not
know
of
any
man
who
would
buy
an
abbey
with
all
its
rights
and
franchises
do
you
friend
rightly
sir
the
land
be
so
poor
it
hath
no
heart
in
it
it
doth
scarce
repay
the
tillage
and
what
the
house
is
you
may
see
the
curse
of
the
monks
is
on
it
but
still
sir
if
you
have
a
mind
to
be
rid
of
the
place
i
have
a
little
laid
by
and
a
natural
love
for
the
land
having
been
bred
on
it
and
taken
the
colour
of
my
mind
and
my
stubby
growth
therefrom
and
i
will
give
and
this
astutest
of
all
the
caresfoots
whispered
a
very
small
sum
into
sir
ear
price
is
very
small
good
friend
it
doth
almost
vanish
into
nothing
and
methinks
the
land
that
reared
you
can
not
be
so
unkind
as
you
would
have
me
think
the
monks
did
not
love
bad
land
but
yet
if
thou
hast
it
in
the
gold
i
will
take
it
it
will
pay
off
a
debt
or
two
and
i
care
not
for
the
burden
of
the
and
so
farmer
caresfoot
became
the
lawful
owner
of
bratham
abbey
with
its
two
advowsons
its
royal
franchises
of
and
deodand
and
more
than
a
thousand
acres
of
the
best
land
in
marlshire
the
same
astuteness
that
had
enabled
this
wise
progenitor
to
acquire
the
estate
enabled
his
descendants
to
stick
tightly
to
it
and
though
like
other
families
they
had
at
times
met
with
reverses
they
never
lost
their
grip
of
the
abbey
property
during
the
course
of
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
land
increased
largely
in
value
and
its
acreage
was
considerably
added
to
by
the
father
of
the
present
owner
a
man
of
frugal
mind
but
with
the
family
mania
for
the
collection
of
all
sorts
of
plate
strongly
developed
but
it
was
father
caresfoot
who
had
during
his
fifty
tenure
of
the
property
raised
the
family
to
its
present
opulent
condition
firstly
by
a
strict
attention
to
business
and
the
large
accumulations
resulting
from
his
practice
of
always
living
upon
half
his
income
and
secondly
by
his
marriage
late
in
middle
life
with
miss
bland
the
heiress
of
the
neighbouring
isleworth
estates
that
stretched
over
some
two
thousand
acres
of
land
this
lady
who
was
mother
did
not
live
long
to
enjoy
her
wealth
and
station
her
husband
never
spoke
a
rough
word
to
her
and
yet
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
she
died
of
fear
of
him
the
marriage
had
been
one
of
convenience
not
of
affection
indeed
poor
anna
bland
had
secretly
admired
the
curate
at
isleworth
and
hated
caresfoot
and
his
glittering
eye
but
she
married
him
for
all
that
to
feel
that
till
she
died
that
glance
was
always
playing
round
her
like
a
rapier
in
the
hands
of
a
skilled
fencer
and
very
soon
she
did
die
caresfoot
receiving
her
last
words
and
wishes
with
the
same
exquisite
and
unmoved
politeness
that
he
had
extended
to
every
remark
she
had
made
to
him
in
the
course
of
their
married
life
having
satisfactorily
eyed
caresfoot
off
into
a
better
world
her
husband
gave
up
all
idea
of
further
matrimonial
ventures
and
set
himself
to
heap
up
riches
but
a
little
before
his
death
and
just
after
his
birth
an
event
had
occurred
in
the
family
that
had
disturbed
him
not
a
little
his
father
had
left
two
sons
himself
and
a
brother
many
years
his
junior
now
this
brother
was
very
dear
to
caresfoot
his
affection
for
him
was
the
one
weak
point
in
his
armour
nor
was
it
rendered
any
the
less
sincere
but
rather
the
more
touching
by
the
fact
that
its
object
was
little
better
than
it
is
therefore
easy
to
imagine
his
distress
and
anger
when
he
heard
that
a
woman
who
had
till
shortly
before
been
at
the
abbey
house
and
was
now
living
in
the
village
had
been
confined
of
a
son
which
she
fixed
upon
his
brother
whose
wife
she
declared
herself
to
be
investigation
only
brought
out
the
truth
of
the
story
his
brother
had
been
entrapped
into
a
glaring
but
caresfoot
proved
himself
equal
to
the
occasion
so
soon
as
his
as
it
pleased
him
to
call
her
sardonically
had
sufficiently
recovered
he
called
upon
her
what
took
place
at
the
visit
never
transpired
but
next
day
caresfoot
left
her
native
place
never
to
return
the
child
remaining
with
the
father
or
rather
with
the
uncle
that
boy
was
george
at
the
time
when
this
story
opens
both
his
parents
were
dead
his
father
from
illness
resulting
from
entire
failure
of
brain
power
the
mother
from
drink
whether
it
was
that
he
considered
the
circumstance
of
the
birth
entitled
him
to
peculiar
consideration
or
that
he
transferred
to
him
the
affection
he
bore
his
father
the
result
was
that
his
nephew
was
quite
as
dear
if
not
even
dearer
to
caresfoot
than
his
own
son
not
however
that
he
allowed
his
preference
to
be
apparent
save
in
the
negative
way
that
he
was
blind
to
faults
in
george
that
he
was
sufficiently
quick
to
note
in
philip
to
observers
this
partiality
seemed
the
more
strange
when
they
thought
upon
bonny
face
and
form
and
then
noted
how
the
father
and
mother
had
left
their
mark
in
thick
lips
small
restless
eyes
pallid
complexion
and
form
when
philip
shook
off
his
grasp
and
vanished
towards
the
lake
he
did
so
with
bitter
wrath
and
hatred
in
his
heart
for
he
saw
but
too
clearly
that
he
had
deeply
injured
himself
in
his
estimation
and
what
was
more
he
felt
that
so
much
as
he
had
sunk
his
side
of
the
balance
by
so
much
he
had
raised
up
that
of
george
he
was
inculpated
a
bellamy
came
upon
the
scene
to
save
george
and
what
was
worse
an
untruthful
bellamy
he
was
the
aggressor
and
george
the
meek
in
spirit
with
the
soft
answer
that
turneth
away
wrath
it
was
intolerable
he
hated
his
father
he
hated
george
there
was
no
justice
in
the
world
and
he
had
not
wit
to
play
rogue
with
such
a
one
as
his
cousin
appearances
were
always
against
him
he
hated
everybody
and
then
he
began
to
think
that
there
was
in
the
very
next
parish
somebody
whom
he
did
not
hate
but
who
on
the
contrary
interested
him
and
was
always
ready
to
listen
to
his
troubles
and
he
also
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
whilst
his
mind
had
been
thinking
his
legs
had
been
walking
and
that
he
was
very
near
the
abode
of
that
at
its
gates
in
short
he
paused
and
looked
at
his
watch
it
had
stopped
at
eleven
the
one
blow
that
george
had
succeeded
in
planting
upon
him
having
landed
on
it
to
the
great
detriment
of
both
the
watch
and
the
knuckles
but
the
sun
told
him
that
it
was
about
twelve
not
too
early
to
call
so
he
opened
the
gate
and
advancing
up
an
avenue
of
old
beeches
to
a
square
house
of
the
time
of
queen
anne
boldly
rang
the
bell
was
miss
lee
at
home
yes
miss
lee
was
in
the
greenhouse
perhaps
philip
would
step
into
the
garden
which
philip
did
accordingly
do
you
do
philip
delighted
to
see
you
just
come
in
time
to
help
in
the
slaughter
of
pig
green
fly
going
to
kill
cruel
daresay
it
is
cruel
but
i
care
grumps
always
said
that
i
had
no
heart
and
so
far
as
green
fly
are
concerned
grumps
was
certainly
right
now
just
look
at
this
lily
it
is
an
auratum
i
gave
out
of
my
own
money
for
that
bulb
last
autumn
and
now
the
bloom
is
not
worth
twopence
all
through
green
fly
if
i
were
a
man
i
declare
i
should
swear
please
swear
for
me
philip
go
outside
and
do
it
so
that
i
have
it
on
my
conscience
but
now
for
vengeance
oh
i
say
i
forgot
you
know
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
looking
very
the
matter
any
one
dead
no
so
much
better
than
that
got
her
what
has
got
her
what
is
chancery
of
course
i
always
call
chancery
i
take
its
name
in
vain
for
worlds
i
am
too
much
afraid
i
might
be
made
to
a
cause
why
and
then
be
locked
up
for
contempt
which
frequently
happens
after
you
have
tried
to
a
that
is
what
has
happened
to
grumps
she
is
now
showing
a
cause
shortly
she
will
be
locked
up
when
she
comes
out
if
she
ever
does
come
out
i
think
that
she
will
avoid
wards
in
chancery
in
future
she
will
have
too
much
sympathy
with
them
and
too
much
practical
experience
of
their
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
maria
what
has
happened
to
miss
gregson
grumps
you
remember
one
of
my
guardians
or
rather
his
wife
got
to
appoint
her
my
chaperon
but
my
other
guardian
wanted
to
appoint
somebody
else
and
after
taking
eighteen
months
to
do
it
he
has
moved
the
court
to
show
that
grumps
is
not
a
and
proper
the
idea
of
calling
grumps
improper
she
nearly
fainted
at
it
and
swore
that
whether
she
lived
through
it
or
whether
she
she
would
never
come
within
a
mile
of
me
or
any
other
ward
if
she
could
help
it
not
even
the
ward
of
an
hospital
i
told
her
to
be
careful
or
she
would
be
contempt
which
frightened
her
so
that
she
hardly
spoke
again
till
she
left
yesterday
poor
grumps
i
expect
she
is
on
bread
and
water
now
but
if
she
makes
herself
half
as
disagreeable
to
the
as
she
did
to
me
i
believe
that
they
will
keep
her
long
wear
the
gaolers
out
she
will
wear
the
walls
out
she
will
wear
down
to
the
bone
and
then
they
will
let
her
loose
upon
the
world
again
why
there
is
the
bell
for
lunch
and
not
a
single
green
fly
the
less
never
mind
i
will
do
for
them
how
it
would
add
to
her
sufferings
in
her
lonely
cell
if
she
could
see
us
going
to
a
lunch
come
on
philip
come
quick
or
the
cutlets
will
get
cold
and
i
hate
cold
and
off
she
tripped
followed
by
the
laughing
philip
who
by
the
way
was
now
looking
quite
handsome
again
maria
lee
was
not
very
pretty
at
her
then
she
was
a
perfect
specimen
of
a
young
english
country
girl
fresh
as
a
rose
and
sound
as
a
bell
and
endowed
besides
with
a
quick
wit
and
a
ready
sympathy
she
was
essentially
one
of
that
class
of
englishwomen
who
make
the
english
upper
middle
class
what
it
of
the
finest
and
soundest
in
the
world
philip
following
her
into
the
house
thought
that
she
was
charming
nor
being
a
caresfoot
and
therefore
having
a
considerable
eye
to
the
main
chance
did
the
fact
of
her
being
the
heiress
to
fifteen
hundred
a
year
in
land
detract
from
her
charms
the
cutlets
were
excellent
and
maria
ate
three
and
was
very
comical
about
the
departed
grumps
indeed
anybody
not
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
would
have
gathered
that
that
excellent
lady
was
to
be
shortly
put
to
the
question
philip
was
not
quite
so
merry
he
was
oppressed
both
by
recollections
of
what
had
happened
and
apprehensions
of
what
might
happen
is
the
matter
philip
she
asked
when
they
had
left
the
table
to
sit
under
the
trees
on
the
lawn
can
see
that
something
is
the
matter
tell
me
all
about
it
and
philip
told
her
what
had
happened
that
morning
laying
bare
all
his
and
not
even
concealing
his
evil
deeds
when
he
had
done
she
pondered
awhile
tapping
her
little
foot
upon
the
turf
she
said
at
last
in
quite
a
changed
voice
do
not
think
that
you
are
being
well
treated
i
do
not
think
that
your
cousin
means
kindly
by
you
i
do
not
think
that
you
have
behaved
rightly
either
i
like
that
about
the
ten
pounds
and
i
think
that
you
should
not
have
touched
george
he
is
not
so
strong
as
you
please
try
to
do
as
your
me
i
am
sure
i
wonder
that
you
are
afraid
of
him
i
you
and
regain
his
affection
and
make
it
up
with
george
and
if
you
get
into
any
more
troubles
come
and
tell
me
about
them
before
you
do
anything
foolish
for
though
according
to
grumps
i
am
silly
enough
two
heads
are
better
than
the
tears
stood
in
the
brown
eyes
as
he
listened
to
her
he
gulped
them
down
however
and
are
awfully
kind
to
me
you
are
the
only
friend
i
have
sometimes
i
think
that
you
are
an
philip
if
heard
you
talk
like
that
you
would
join
grumps
let
me
hear
any
more
such
stuff
but
though
she
spoke
sharply
somehow
she
did
not
look
displeased
must
be
off
he
said
at
length
promised
to
go
with
my
father
to
see
a
new
building
on
farm
i
have
only
twenty
minutes
to
get
home
and
rising
they
went
into
the
house
through
a
french
window
opening
on
to
the
lawn
in
the
he
turned
and
after
a
hesitation
stuttered
be
angry
with
me
but
may
i
give
you
a
kiss
she
blushed
vividly
dare
you
suggest
such
a
thing
as
grumps
has
gone
and
there
is
no
new
grumps
to
refer
to
and
therefore
i
can
only
consult
my
own
wishes
perhaps
if
you
really
wish
to
philip
why
philip
you
and
he
did
when
he
was
gone
she
leant
her
head
against
the
cold
marble
mantelpiece
do
love
him
she
murmured
that
i
chapter
iii
philip
was
not
very
fond
of
taking
walks
with
his
father
since
he
found
that
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
they
afforded
opportunities
for
inculcation
of
facts
of
the
driest
description
with
reference
to
estate
management
or
to
the
narration
by
his
parent
of
little
histories
of
which
his
conduct
upon
some
recent
occasion
would
adorn
the
moral
on
this
particular
occasion
the
prospect
was
particularly
unpleasant
for
his
father
would
he
was
well
aware
overflow
with
awful
politeness
indeed
after
the
scene
of
the
morning
it
could
not
be
otherwise
oh
how
much
rather
would
he
have
spent
that
lovely
afternoon
with
maria
lee
dear
maria
he
would
go
and
see
her
again
the
very
next
day
when
he
arrived
some
ten
minutes
after
time
in
the
hall
of
the
abbey
house
he
found
his
father
standing
watch
in
hand
exactly
under
the
big
clock
as
though
he
was
determined
to
make
a
note
by
double
entry
of
every
passing
second
i
asked
you
to
walk
with
me
this
afternoon
philip
i
if
my
memory
does
not
deceive
me
was
careful
to
say
that
i
had
no
wish
to
interfere
with
any
prior
engagement
i
was
aware
how
little
interest
compared
to
your
cousin
george
you
take
in
the
estate
and
i
had
no
wish
to
impose
an
uncongenial
task
but
as
you
kindly
volunteered
to
accompany
me
i
regret
that
you
did
not
find
it
convenient
to
be
punctual
to
the
time
you
fixed
i
have
now
waited
for
you
for
seventeen
minutes
and
let
me
tell
you
that
at
my
time
of
life
i
can
not
afford
to
lose
seventeen
minutes
may
i
ask
what
has
delayed
you
this
long
speech
had
given
philip
the
opportunity
of
recovering
the
breath
that
he
had
lost
in
running
home
he
replied
have
been
lunching
with
miss
indeed
then
i
no
longer
wonder
that
you
kept
me
waiting
and
i
must
say
that
in
this
particular
i
commend
your
taste
miss
lee
is
a
young
lady
of
good
family
good
manners
and
good
means
if
her
estate
went
with
this
property
it
would
complete
as
pretty
a
five
thousand
acres
of
mixed
soil
as
there
is
in
the
county
those
are
beautiful
old
meadows
of
hers
beautiful
but
here
the
old
man
checked
himself
on
leaving
the
house
they
had
passed
together
down
a
walk
called
the
tunnel
walk
on
account
of
the
arching
boughs
of
the
that
interlaced
themselves
overhead
at
the
end
of
this
avenue
and
on
the
borders
of
the
lake
there
stood
an
enormous
but
still
growing
oak
known
as
staff
it
was
the
old
favourite
tree
and
the
best
topped
piece
of
timber
for
many
miles
round
wonder
said
philip
by
way
of
making
a
little
pleasant
conversation
that
tree
was
called
ignorance
astonishes
me
philip
but
i
suppose
that
there
are
some
people
who
can
live
for
years
in
a
place
and
yet
imbibe
nothing
of
its
traditions
perhaps
you
know
that
the
monks
were
driven
out
of
these
ruins
by
henry
viii
well
on
the
spot
where
that
tree
now
stands
there
grew
a
still
greater
oak
a
giant
tree
its
trunk
measured
sixteen
loads
of
timber
which
had
as
tradition
said
been
planted
by
the
first
prior
of
the
abbey
when
england
was
still
saxon
the
night
the
monks
left
a
great
gale
raged
over
england
it
was
in
october
when
the
trees
were
full
of
leaf
and
its
fiercest
gust
tore
the
great
oak
from
its
roothold
and
flung
it
into
the
lake
look
do
you
see
that
rise
in
the
sand
there
by
the
edge
of
the
deep
pool
in
the
eight
foot
water
that
is
there
it
is
supposed
to
lie
well
the
whole
said
that
it
was
a
sign
that
the
monks
had
gone
for
ever
from
bratham
abbey
and
the
was
right
but
when
your
ancestor
old
yeoman
caresfoot
bought
this
place
and
came
to
live
here
in
a
year
when
there
was
a
great
black
frost
that
set
the
waters
of
the
lake
like
one
of
the
roads
he
asked
his
neighbours
ay
and
his
labouring
folk
to
come
and
dine
with
him
and
drink
to
the
success
of
his
purchase
it
was
a
proud
day
for
him
and
when
dinner
was
done
and
they
were
all
mellow
with
strong
ale
he
bade
them
step
down
to
the
borders
of
the
lake
as
he
would
have
them
be
witness
to
a
ceremony
when
they
reached
the
spot
they
saw
a
curious
sight
for
there
on
a
strong
dray
and
dragged
by
farmer
six
best
horses
was
an
oak
of
fifty
growth
coming
across
the
ice
earth
roots
and
all
that
spot
where
it
now
stands
there
had
been
a
great
hole
ten
feet
deep
by
fourteen
feet
square
dug
to
receive
it
and
into
that
hole
caresfoot
staff
was
tilted
and
levered
off
the
dray
and
when
it
had
been
planted
and
the
frozen
earth
well
trodden
in
your
grandfather
in
the
ninth
degree
brought
his
guests
back
to
the
old
and
made
a
speech
which
as
it
was
the
first
and
last
he
ever
made
was
long
remembered
in
the
it
was
put
into
modern
english
something
like
this
oak
has
gone
into
the
water
and
folks
said
that
it
was
for
a
sign
that
the
monks
would
never
come
back
to
bratham
and
that
it
was
the
wind
that
put
it
there
and
neighbours
as
ye
know
the
broad
bratham
lands
and
the
fat
marshes
down
by
the
brook
passed
by
grant
to
a
man
that
knew
not
clay
from
loam
or
layer
from
pasturage
and
from
him
they
passed
by
the
will
to
me
as
i
have
asked
you
here
to
celebrate
and
now
neighbours
i
have
a
mind
and
though
it
seem
to
you
but
a
childish
thing
yet
i
have
a
mind
and
have
set
myself
to
fulfil
it
when
i
was
yet
a
little
lad
and
drove
the
swine
out
to
feed
on
the
hill
yonder
when
the
acorns
had
fallen
afore
farmer
father
had
gracious
leave
from
the
feoffees
to
put
up
the
fence
that
doth
now
so
sorely
vex
us
i
found
one
day
a
great
acorn
as
big
as
a
egg
and
of
a
rich
and
wondrous
brown
and
this
acorn
i
bore
home
and
planted
in
kind
earth
in
the
corner
of
my
garden
thinking
that
it
would
grow
and
that
one
day
i
would
hew
its
growth
and
use
it
for
a
staff
now
that
was
fifty
long
years
ago
lads
and
there
where
grew
oak
there
neighbours
i
have
set
my
staff
the
monks
have
told
us
how
in
israel
every
man
planted
his
fig
and
his
vine
for
the
fig
i
know
not
rightly
what
that
is
but
for
the
vine
i
will
plant
no
creeping
clinging
vine
but
a
hearty
english
oak
that
if
they
do
but
give
it
good
room
to
breathe
in
and
save
their
heirloom
from
the
axe
shall
cast
shade
and
grow
acorns
and
burst
into
leaf
in
the
spring
and
grow
naked
in
the
winter
when
ten
generations
of
our
children
and
our
children
shall
have
mixed
their
dust
with
ours
yonder
in
the
graveyard
and
now
neighbours
i
have
talked
too
long
though
i
am
better
at
doing
than
talking
but
ye
will
even
forgive
me
for
i
will
not
talk
to
you
again
though
on
this
the
great
day
of
my
life
i
was
minded
to
speak
but
i
will
bid
you
every
man
pledge
a
health
to
the
staff
and
ask
a
prayer
that
so
long
as
it
shall
push
its
leaves
so
long
may
the
race
of
my
loins
be
here
to
sit
beneath
its
shade
and
even
mayhap
when
the
corn
is
ripe
and
the
moon
is
up
and
their
hearts
grow
soft
towards
the
past
to
talk
with
kinsman
or
with
sweetheart
of
the
old
man
who
struck
it
in
this
kindly
the
old
face
grew
tender
as
he
told
this
legend
of
the
forgotten
dead
and
young
imagination
summoned
up
the
strange
scene
of
the
crowd
of
rustics
gathered
in
the
snow
and
frost
round
this
very
tree
said
his
father
suddenly
will
hold
the
staff
one
day
be
like
it
of
an
oaken
english
heart
and
you
will
defy
wind
and
weather
as
it
has
done
and
as
your
forbears
have
done
come
we
must
go
the
way
philip
he
continued
after
a
while
will
remember
what
i
said
to
you
this
hope
that
you
will
remember
it
though
i
spoke
in
try
to
deceive
me
again
or
you
will
regret
it
and
now
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
i
wish
you
to
go
to
college
and
receive
an
education
that
will
fit
you
to
hold
the
position
you
must
in
the
course
of
nature
one
day
fill
in
the
county
the
oxford
term
begins
in
a
few
days
and
you
have
for
some
years
been
entered
at
magdalen
college
i
do
not
expect
you
to
be
a
scholar
but
i
do
expect
you
to
brush
off
your
rough
ways
and
your
local
ideas
and
to
learn
to
become
such
a
person
both
in
your
conduct
and
your
mind
as
a
gentleman
of
your
station
should
george
to
go
to
college
too
i
have
spoken
to
him
on
the
subject
and
he
does
not
wish
it
he
says
very
wisely
that
with
his
small
prospects
he
would
rather
spend
the
time
in
learning
how
to
earn
his
living
so
he
is
going
to
be
articled
to
the
roxham
lawyers
foster
and
son
or
rather
foster
and
bellamy
for
young
bellamy
who
is
a
lawyer
by
profession
came
here
this
morning
not
to
speak
about
you
but
on
a
message
from
the
firm
to
say
that
he
is
now
a
junior
partner
and
that
they
will
be
very
happy
to
take
george
as
an
articled
clerk
he
is
a
shrewd
young
man
and
it
will
be
a
great
advantage
to
george
to
have
his
advice
and
example
before
philip
assented
and
went
on
in
silence
reflecting
on
the
curious
change
in
his
immediate
prospects
that
this
walk
had
brought
to
light
he
was
much
rejoiced
at
the
prospect
of
losing
sight
of
george
for
a
while
and
was
sufficiently
intelligent
to
appreciate
the
advantages
social
and
mental
that
the
university
would
offer
him
but
it
struck
him
that
there
were
two
things
which
he
did
not
like
about
the
scheme
the
first
of
these
was
that
whilst
he
was
pursuing
his
academical
studies
george
would
practically
be
left
on
the
roxham
was
only
six
miles
put
in
motion
any
schemes
he
might
have
devised
and
philip
was
sure
that
he
had
devised
schemes
and
the
second
that
oxford
was
a
long
way
from
maria
lee
however
he
kept
his
objections
to
himself
in
due
course
they
reached
the
buildings
they
had
set
out
to
examine
and
the
old
squire
having
settled
what
was
to
be
done
and
what
was
to
be
left
undone
with
characteristic
promptitude
and
shrewdness
they
turned
homewards
in
passing
through
the
shrubberies
on
their
way
back
to
the
house
they
suddenly
came
upon
a
lad
of
about
fifteen
emerging
from
a
with
a
nest
full
of
young
blackbirds
in
his
hand
now
if
there
was
one
thing
in
this
world
more
calculated
than
another
to
rouse
the
most
objectionable
traits
of
the
old
character
into
rapid
action
it
was
the
discovery
of
boys
and
more
especially
boys
in
his
plantations
in
the
first
place
he
hated
trespassers
and
in
the
second
it
was
one
of
his
simple
pleasures
to
walk
in
the
early
morning
and
listen
to
the
singing
of
the
birds
that
swarmed
around
accordingly
at
the
obnoxious
sight
he
stopped
suddenly
and
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
addressed
the
trembling
youth
in
his
sweetest
voice
name
is
i
me
if
i
am
and
you
have
come
here
steal
my
the
frightened
boy
walked
slowly
backwards
followed
by
the
old
man
with
his
fiery
eyes
fixed
upon
his
face
till
at
last
concussion
against
the
trunk
of
a
great
tree
prevented
further
retreat
here
he
stood
for
about
thirty
seconds
writhing
under
the
glance
that
seemed
to
pierce
him
through
and
through
till
at
last
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
but
flung
himself
on
the
ground
roaring
ee
squire
ee
now
look
at
me
with
that
eye
take
and
thrash
me
squire
but
ee
fix
me
so
i
had
no
more
nor
twenty
this
year
and
a
nest
of
spinxes
and
tom
smith
had
and
a
young
owl
oh
oh
enraged
beyond
measure
at
this
last
piece
of
information
caresfoot
took
his
victim
at
his
word
and
ceasing
his
ocular
experiments
laid
into
the
less
honourable
portion
of
his
form
with
the
malacca
cane
in
a
way
that
astonished
the
prostrate
jim
though
he
was
afterwards
heard
to
declare
that
the
cane
not
nothing
compared
with
the
eye
which
wore
a
hot
coal
it
wore
and
frizzled
your
innards
as
when
jim
brady
had
departed
never
to
return
again
and
the
old
man
had
recovered
his
usual
suavity
of
manner
he
remarked
to
his
son
is
some
curious
property
in
the
human
eye
a
property
that
is
i
believe
very
much
developed
in
my
own
did
you
observe
the
effect
of
my
glance
upon
that
boy
i
was
trying
an
experiment
on
him
i
remember
it
was
always
the
same
with
your
poor
mother
she
could
never
bear
me
to
look
at
philip
made
no
reply
but
he
thought
that
if
she
had
been
the
object
of
experiments
of
that
nature
it
was
not
very
wonderful
shortly
after
their
return
home
he
received
a
note
from
miss
lee
it
ran
thus
dear
philip
you
think
just
after
you
had
gone
away
i
got
by
the
post
which
jones
the
butcher
brought
from
roxham
several
letters
amongst
them
one
from
grumps
and
one
from
uncle
tom
grumps
has
shown
a
cause
why
said
she
was
not
an
improper
person
but
for
all
that
she
is
so
angry
with
uncle
tom
that
she
will
not
come
back
but
has
accepted
an
offer
to
go
to
canada
as
companion
to
a
lady
so
farewell
grumps
for
uncle
tom
suggested
that
i
should
live
with
some
of
my
relations
till
i
came
of
age
and
pay
them
four
hundred
a
year
which
i
think
a
good
deal
i
am
sure
it
cost
four
hundred
a
year
to
feed
me
though
i
have
such
an
appetite
i
had
no
idea
they
were
all
so
fond
of
me
before
they
all
want
me
to
come
and
live
with
them
except
aunt
chambers
who
you
know
lives
in
jersey
uncle
tom
says
in
his
letter
that
he
shall
be
glad
if
his
daughters
can
have
the
advantage
of
my
example
and
of
studying
my
polished
manners
just
fancy
polished
manners
and
i
know
because
little
tom
who
is
a
brick
told
me
that
only
last
year
he
heard
his
father
tell
the
i
was
a
dowdy
miss
but
that
she
must
keep
in
with
me
and
flatter
me
up
no
i
will
not
live
with
uncle
tom
and
i
will
tell
so
if
i
must
leave
my
home
i
will
go
to
aunt
chambers
at
jersey
jersey
is
a
beautiful
place
for
flowers
and
one
learns
french
there
without
the
trouble
of
learning
it
and
i
like
aunt
chambers
and
she
has
no
children
and
nothing
but
the
memory
of
a
dear
departed
but
i
like
leaving
home
and
feel
very
much
inclined
to
cry
the
court
of
chancery
and
uncle
tom
and
his
interference
too
i
suppose
you
find
time
to
come
over
morning
to
see
me
off
dear
philip
affectionate
friend
philip
did
manage
to
find
time
next
morning
and
came
back
looking
very
disconsolate
chapter
iv
philip
went
to
college
in
due
course
and
george
departed
to
learn
his
business
as
a
lawyer
in
roxham
but
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
us
to
enter
into
the
details
of
their
respective
careers
during
this
period
of
their
lives
at
college
philip
did
fairly
well
and
being
a
caresfoot
did
not
run
into
debt
he
was
as
his
great
bodily
strength
gave
promise
of
a
athlete
and
for
two
years
stroked
the
magdalen
boat
nor
did
he
altogether
neglect
his
books
but
his
reading
was
of
a
desultory
and
order
and
much
directed
towards
the
investigation
of
mystical
subjects
fairly
well
liked
amongst
the
men
with
whom
he
mixed
he
could
hardly
be
called
popular
his
temperament
was
too
uncertain
for
that
at
times
he
was
the
gayest
of
the
gay
and
then
when
the
fit
took
him
he
would
be
plunged
into
a
state
of
gloomy
depression
that
might
last
for
days
his
companions
to
whom
his
mystical
studies
were
a
favourite
jest
were
wont
to
assert
that
on
these
occasions
he
was
preparing
for
a
visit
from
his
familiar
but
the
joke
was
one
that
he
never
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
appreciate
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
these
fits
of
gloom
were
constitutional
with
him
and
very
possibly
had
their
origin
in
the
state
of
his
mind
before
his
birth
when
her
whole
thoughts
were
coloured
by
her
morbid
and
fanciful
terror
of
her
husband
and
her
frantic
anxiety
to
conciliate
him
during
the
three
years
that
he
spent
at
college
philip
saw
but
little
of
george
since
when
he
happened
to
be
down
at
bratham
which
was
not
often
for
he
spent
most
of
his
vacations
abroad
george
avoided
coming
there
as
much
as
possible
indeed
there
was
a
tacit
agreement
between
the
two
young
men
that
they
would
see
as
little
of
each
other
as
might
be
convenient
but
though
he
did
not
see
much
of
him
himself
philip
was
none
the
less
aware
that
influence
over
his
father
was
if
anything
on
the
increase
the
old
letters
were
full
of
him
and
of
the
admirable
way
in
which
he
managed
the
estate
for
it
was
now
practically
in
his
hands
indeed
to
his
surprise
and
somewhat
to
his
disgust
he
found
that
george
began
to
be
spoken
of
indifferently
with
himself
as
the
long
before
his
college
days
had
come
to
an
end
philip
had
determined
that
he
would
do
his
best
as
soon
as
opportunity
offered
to
reduce
his
cousin
to
his
proper
place
not
by
the
violent
means
to
which
he
had
resorted
in
other
days
but
rather
by
showing
himself
to
be
equally
capable
equally
assiduous
and
equally
respectful
and
affectionate
at
last
the
day
came
when
he
was
to
bid
farewell
to
oxford
for
good
and
in
due
course
he
found
himself
in
a
railway
carriage
it
useless
to
waste
money
he
always
went
bound
for
roxham
just
before
the
train
left
the
platform
at
paddington
philip
was
agreeably
surprised
out
of
his
meditations
by
the
entry
into
his
carriage
of
an
extremely
elegant
and
stately
young
lady
a
foreigner
as
he
judged
from
her
strong
accent
when
she
addressed
the
porter
with
the
innate
gallantry
of
he
immediately
laid
himself
out
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
one
possessed
of
such
proud
yet
melting
blue
eyes
such
lovely
hair
and
a
figure
that
would
not
have
disgraced
diana
and
with
this
view
set
himself
to
render
her
such
little
services
as
one
can
offer
to
another
they
were
accepted
reservedly
at
first
then
gratefully
and
before
long
the
reserve
broke
down
entirely
and
this
very
handsome
pair
dropped
into
a
conversation
as
animated
as
the
broken
english
would
allow
the
lady
told
him
that
her
name
was
hilda
von
holtzhausen
that
she
was
of
a
german
family
and
had
come
to
england
to
enter
a
family
as
companion
in
order
to
obtain
a
perfect
knowledge
of
the
english
language
she
had
already
been
to
france
and
acquired
french
when
she
knew
english
then
she
had
been
promised
a
place
as
under
government
in
her
own
country
her
father
and
mother
were
dead
and
she
had
no
brothers
or
sisters
and
very
few
friends
where
was
she
going
to
she
was
going
to
a
place
called
roxham
here
it
was
written
on
the
ticket
she
was
going
to
be
companion
to
a
dear
young
lady
very
rich
like
all
the
english
whom
she
had
met
when
she
had
travelled
with
her
french
family
to
jersey
a
miss
lee
say
so
said
philip
she
come
back
to
rewtham
do
you
then
know
her
is
i
used
to
three
years
ago
i
live
in
the
next
then
perhaps
you
are
the
gentleman
of
whom
i
have
heard
her
to
speak
whom
she
did
seem
to
appear
to
love
is
not
that
the
word
be
very
fond
you
philip
laughed
blushed
and
acknowledged
his
identity
with
the
gentleman
whom
miss
lee
seem
to
appear
to
i
am
glad
then
we
shall
be
friends
and
see
each
other
shall
we
not
he
declared
unreservedly
that
she
should
see
him
very
often
from
fräulein
von
holtzhausen
philip
gathered
in
the
course
of
their
journey
a
good
many
particulars
about
miss
lee
it
appeared
that
having
attained
her
majority
she
was
coming
back
to
live
at
her
old
home
at
rewtham
whither
she
had
tried
to
persuade
her
aunt
chambers
to
accompany
her
but
without
success
that
lady
being
too
much
attached
to
jersey
to
leave
it
during
the
course
of
a
long
stay
on
the
island
the
two
girls
had
become
fast
friends
and
the
friendship
had
culminated
in
an
offer
being
made
by
maria
lee
to
fräulein
von
holtzhausen
to
come
and
live
with
her
as
a
companion
a
proposal
that
exactly
suited
the
latter
the
mention
of
miss
name
had
awakened
pleasant
recollections
in
mind
recollections
that
at
any
other
time
might
have
tended
towards
the
sentimental
but
when
under
fire
from
the
blue
eyes
of
this
stately
foreigner
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
feel
sentimental
about
anybody
save
herself
journey
is
over
all
too
soon
was
the
secret
thought
of
each
as
they
stepped
on
to
the
roxham
platform
before
they
had
finally
said
however
a
young
lady
with
a
dainty
figure
in
a
shady
hat
and
pink
and
white
dress
came
running
along
the
platform
hilda
here
i
am
how
do
you
do
dear
welcome
home
and
she
was
about
to
seal
her
welcome
with
a
kiss
when
her
eye
fell
upon
philip
standing
by
philip
she
cried
with
a
blush
you
know
me
have
i
changed
much
i
should
have
known
you
anywhere
and
i
am
glad
to
see
you
awfully
glad
excuse
the
slang
but
it
is
such
a
relief
to
be
able
to
say
without
being
pulled
up
by
aunt
chambers
just
think
it
is
three
years
since
we
met
do
you
remember
grumps
how
do
i
look
do
you
think
you
will
like
me
as
much
as
you
used
to
think
that
you
are
looking
the
same
dear
girl
that
you
always
used
to
look
only
you
have
grown
very
pretty
and
it
is
not
possible
that
i
shall
like
you
more
than
i
used
think
they
must
teach
you
to
pay
compliments
at
oxford
philip
she
answered
flushing
with
pleasure
it
is
all
rubbish
for
you
to
say
that
i
am
pretty
because
i
know
i
am
then
confidentially
glancing
round
to
see
that
there
was
nobody
within
hearing
hilda
was
engaged
with
a
porter
in
looking
after
her
things
look
at
my
nose
and
you
will
soon
change
your
mind
broader
and
flatter
and
snubbier
than
ever
i
consider
that
i
have
got
a
bone
to
pick
with
providence
about
that
nose
ah
here
comes
hilda
she
lovely
beauty
for
you
if
you
like
she
got
a
nose
come
and
show
us
to
the
carriage
you
will
come
and
lunch
with
us
you
i
am
so
glad
to
get
back
to
the
old
house
again
and
i
mean
to
have
such
a
garden
is
short
and
joys
are
fleeting
as
aunt
chambers
always
says
so
i
mean
to
make
the
best
of
it
whilst
it
lasts
i
saw
your
father
yesterday
he
is
a
dear
old
man
though
he
has
such
awful
eyes
i
never
felt
so
happy
in
my
life
as
i
do
now
one
and
she
was
gone
leaving
philip
with
something
to
think
about
reception
at
home
was
cordial
and
reassuring
he
found
his
father
considerably
aged
in
appearance
but
as
handsome
and
upright
as
ever
and
to
all
appearance
heartily
glad
to
see
him
am
glad
to
see
you
back
my
boy
he
said
come
to
take
your
proper
place
if
you
look
at
me
you
will
see
that
you
have
long
to
wait
before
you
take
mine
i
last
much
longer
philip
i
feel
that
is
a
good
age
to
have
reached
i
have
had
my
time
and
put
the
property
in
order
and
now
i
suppose
i
must
make
room
i
went
with
the
clerk
old
jakes
and
marked
out
my
grave
yesterday
a
nice
little
spot
the
other
side
of
the
stone
that
they
say
marks
where
old
yeoman
caresfoot
who
planted
staff
laid
his
bones
and
where
i
wish
to
be
put
in
his
good
company
forget
that
when
the
time
comes
philip
room
for
another
if
you
care
to
keep
it
for
yourself
but
perhaps
you
will
prefer
the
must
not
talk
of
dying
yet
father
you
will
live
many
years
philip
perhaps
one
perhaps
two
not
more
than
two
perhaps
a
month
perhaps
not
a
day
my
life
hangs
on
a
thread
and
he
pointed
to
his
heart
may
snap
any
day
if
it
gets
a
strain
by
the
way
philip
you
see
that
cupboard
open
it
now
you
see
that
stoppered
bottle
with
the
red
label
good
well
now
if
ever
you
see
me
taken
with
an
attack
of
the
heart
i
have
had
one
since
you
were
away
you
know
and
it
nearly
carried
me
off
you
run
for
that
as
hard
as
you
can
go
and
give
it
me
to
drink
half
at
a
time
it
is
a
tremendous
restorative
of
some
sort
and
old
caley
says
that
if
i
do
not
take
it
when
the
next
attack
comes
be
an
end
of
and
he
rapped
his
cane
energetically
on
the
oak
floor
so
philip
i
want
you
to
go
about
and
make
yourself
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
property
so
that
you
may
be
able
to
take
things
over
when
i
die
without
any
hitch
i
hope
that
you
will
be
careful
and
do
well
by
the
land
remember
that
a
big
property
like
this
is
a
sacred
trust
now
there
are
two
more
things
that
i
will
take
this
opportunity
to
say
a
word
to
you
about
first
i
see
that
you
and
your
cousin
george
get
on
well
and
it
grieves
me
you
have
always
had
a
false
idea
of
george
always
and
thought
that
he
was
underhand
nothing
could
be
more
mistaken
than
such
a
notion
george
is
a
most
estimable
young
man
and
my
dear
only
son
i
wish
you
would
try
to
remember
that
is
thicker
than
water
you
and
you
will
be
the
only
two
caresfoots
left
when
i
am
gone
now
perhaps
you
may
think
that
i
intend
enriching
george
at
your
expense
but
that
is
not
so
take
this
key
and
open
the
top
drawer
of
that
secretaire
and
give
me
that
bundle
this
is
my
will
if
you
care
to
look
over
it
and
can
understand
is
more
than
i
will
see
that
everything
is
left
to
you
with
the
exception
of
that
outlying
farm
at
holston
those
three
essex
farms
that
i
bought
two
years
ago
and
twelve
thousand
pounds
in
cash
of
course
as
you
know
the
abbey
house
and
the
lands
immediately
round
are
has
always
been
the
custom
to
entail
them
for
many
generations
there
put
it
back
and
now
the
last
thing
is
i
want
you
to
get
married
philip
i
should
like
to
see
a
grandchild
in
the
house
before
i
die
i
want
you
to
marry
maria
lee
i
like
the
girl
she
comes
of
a
good
old
marlshire
family
married
into
hers
in
the
year
besides
her
property
would
put
yours
into
a
she
is
a
sharp
girl
too
and
quite
pretty
enough
for
a
wife
i
hope
you
will
think
it
over
father
but
perhaps
she
will
not
have
me
i
am
going
to
lunch
there
think
you
need
be
afraid
philip
but
i
keep
you
any
longer
shake
hands
my
boy
perhaps
think
of
your
old
father
kindly
when
you
come
to
stand
in
his
shoes
i
hope
you
will
philip
we
have
had
many
a
quarrel
and
sometimes
i
have
been
wrong
but
i
have
always
wished
to
do
my
duty
by
you
my
boy
forget
to
make
the
best
of
your
time
at
lunch
philip
went
out
of
his
study
considerably
touched
by
the
kindness
and
consideration
with
which
he
had
been
treated
and
not
a
little
relieved
to
find
his
position
with
reference
to
his
succession
to
the
estate
so
much
better
than
he
had
anticipated
and
his
cousin
so
much
worse
fox
has
plotted
in
vain
he
thought
with
secret
exultation
and
then
he
set
himself
to
consider
the
desirability
of
falling
in
with
his
wishes
as
regards
marriage
of
maria
he
was
as
the
reader
is
aware
very
fond
indeed
a
few
years
before
he
had
been
in
love
with
her
or
something
very
like
it
he
knew
too
that
she
would
make
him
a
very
good
wife
and
the
match
was
one
that
in
every
way
commended
itself
to
his
common
sense
and
his
interests
yes
he
would
certainly
take
his
advice
but
every
time
he
said
this
to
he
said
it
pretty
often
that
would
arise
before
his
eye
a
vision
of
the
sweet
blue
eyes
of
miss
stately
companion
what
eyes
they
were
to
be
sure
it
made
blood
run
warm
and
quick
merely
to
think
of
them
indeed
he
could
almost
find
it
in
his
heart
to
wish
that
hilda
was
maria
and
maria
was
in
shoes
what
between
thoughts
of
the
young
lady
he
had
set
himself
to
marry
and
of
the
young
lady
he
did
not
mean
to
marry
but
whose
eyes
he
admired
philip
did
not
sleep
so
well
as
usual
that
night
chapter
philip
did
not
neglect
to
go
to
luncheon
at
rewtham
house
and
a
very
pleasant
luncheon
it
was
indeed
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
him
to
have
said
which
he
found
the
pleasantest
cheerful
chatter
and
flattering
preference
or
sweet
and
gracious
presence
after
luncheon
at
invitation
he
gave
fräulein
von
holtzhausen
her
first
lesson
in
writing
in
english
character
and
to
speak
truth
he
found
the
task
of
guiding
her
fair
hand
through
the
mysteries
of
the
english
alphabet
a
by
no
means
uncongenial
occupation
when
he
came
away
his
admiration
of
blue
eyes
was
more
pronounced
than
ever
but
on
the
other
hand
so
was
his
conviction
that
he
would
be
very
foolish
if
he
allowed
it
to
interfere
with
his
intention
of
making
maria
lee
his
wife
he
who
would
drive
two
women
thus
in
double
harness
must
needs
have
a
light
hand
and
a
ready
lash
and
it
is
certainly
to
the
credit
of
cleverness
that
he
managed
so
well
as
he
did
for
as
time
went
on
he
discovered
his
position
to
be
this
both
hilda
and
maria
were
in
love
with
him
the
former
deeply
and
silently
the
latter
openly
and
ostensibly
now
however
gratifying
this
fact
might
be
to
his
pride
it
was
in
some
ways
a
thorny
discovery
since
he
dared
not
visibly
pay
his
attentions
to
either
for
his
part
he
returned
hilda
von
devotion
to
a
degree
that
surprised
himself
his
passion
for
her
burnt
him
like
a
fire
utterly
searing
away
the
traces
of
his
former
affection
for
maria
lee
under
these
circumstances
most
young
men
of
would
have
thrown
prudence
to
the
winds
and
acknowledged
either
by
acts
or
words
the
object
of
their
love
but
not
so
philip
who
even
at
that
age
was
by
no
means
deficient
in
the
characteristic
caution
of
the
caresfoot
family
he
saw
clearly
that
his
father
would
never
consent
to
his
marriage
with
hilda
nor
to
speak
truth
did
he
himself
at
all
like
the
idea
of
losing
miss
lee
and
her
estates
on
the
other
hand
he
knew
proud
and
jealous
mind
she
was
no
melting
beauty
who
would
sigh
and
submit
to
an
affront
but
for
all
her
gracious
ways
at
heart
a
haughty
woman
who
if
she
reigned
at
all
would
reign
like
alexander
unrivalled
and
alone
that
she
was
well
aware
of
her
tendresse
for
philip
the
latter
very
shortly
guessed
indeed
as
he
suspected
maria
was
in
the
habit
of
confiding
to
her
all
her
hopes
and
fears
connected
with
himself
a
suspicion
that
made
him
very
careful
in
his
remarks
to
that
young
lady
the
early
summer
passed
away
whilst
philip
was
still
thinking
over
his
position
and
the
face
of
the
country
was
blushing
with
all
the
glory
of
july
when
one
afternoon
he
found
himself
as
he
did
pretty
frequently
in
the
shady
at
miss
as
he
entered
the
sound
of
voices
told
him
that
there
were
other
visitors
beside
himself
and
as
soon
as
his
eyes
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
light
he
saw
his
cousin
george
together
with
his
partner
bellamy
and
a
lady
with
whom
he
was
not
acquainted
george
had
improved
in
appearance
somewhat
since
we
last
saw
him
meeting
with
severe
treatment
at
his
hands
the
face
had
filled
up
a
little
with
the
result
that
the
nose
did
not
look
so
hooked
nor
the
thick
lips
so
coarse
and
sensual
the
hair
however
was
as
red
as
ever
and
as
for
the
small
eyes
they
twinkled
with
the
added
sharpness
and
lustre
that
four
years
of
such
experience
of
the
shady
side
of
humanity
as
can
be
gathered
in
a
office
is
able
to
give
to
the
student
of
men
and
manners
so
soon
as
philip
had
said
to
maria
and
hilda
giving
to
each
a
gentle
pressure
of
the
hand
george
greeted
him
with
warmth
are
you
philip
delighted
to
see
you
how
is
my
uncle
bellamy
saw
him
this
morning
and
thought
that
he
did
not
look
certainly
did
think
philip
said
the
gentleman
alluded
to
a
very
little
man
with
a
timid
manner
who
stood
in
the
background
nervously
rubbing
his
dry
hands
certainly
did
think
that
the
squire
looked
aged
when
i
saw
him
this
you
see
bellamy
is
a
good
age
is
it
not
said
philip
cheerfully
philip
a
good
age
a
very
good
age
for
the
and
bellamy
chuckled
softly
somewhere
down
in
his
throat
and
retreated
a
little
is
getting
facetious
broke
in
george
marriage
has
done
that
for
him
by
the
way
philip
do
you
know
bellamy
she
has
only
been
down
here
a
fortnight
you
know
what
no
then
you
have
a
pleasure
to
raising
his
voice
so
that
it
might
be
heard
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
very
clever
woman
and
as
handsome
as
she
is
i
must
ask
you
to
introduce
me
presently
bellamy
i
only
recently
heard
that
you
were
bellamy
blushed
and
twisted
and
was
about
to
speak
when
george
cut
in
again
i
dare
say
you
sly
dog
bellamy
do
you
know
what
he
did
i
introduced
him
to
the
lady
when
we
were
up
in
town
together
last
christmas
i
was
dreadfully
hard
hit
myself
i
can
assure
you
and
as
soon
as
my
back
was
turned
he
went
and
cut
me
out
of
the
turned
my
adored
into
are
you
taking
my
name
in
vain
about
caresfoot
said
a
rich
low
voice
behind
them
me
anne
how
softly
you
move
you
quite
startled
me
said
little
bellamy
putting
on
his
spectacles
in
an
agitated
manner
dear
a
wife
like
an
embodied
conscience
should
always
be
at
her
shoulder
especially
when
he
does
not
know
bellamy
made
no
reply
but
looked
as
though
the
sentiment
was
one
of
which
he
did
not
approve
meantime
the
lady
repeated
her
question
to
george
and
the
two
fell
into
a
bantering
conversation
philip
having
dropped
back
a
little
had
an
opportunity
of
carefully
observing
bellamy
an
occupation
not
without
interest
for
she
was
certainly
worthy
of
notice
about
twenty
years
of
age
and
of
medium
height
her
figure
was
so
finely
proportioned
and
so
roomily
made
that
it
gave
her
the
appearance
of
being
taller
than
she
really
was
the
head
was
set
squarely
on
the
shoulders
the
hair
was
cut
short
and
clustered
in
ringlets
over
the
low
broad
brow
whilst
the
clearly
carved
egyptian
features
and
square
chin
gave
the
whole
face
a
curious
expression
of
resoluteness
and
power
the
eyes
were
and
in
hue
with
enormously
large
dark
pupils
that
had
a
strange
habit
of
expanding
and
contracting
without
apparent
reason
gazing
at
her
philip
was
at
a
loss
to
know
whether
this
woman
so
bizarrely
beautiful
fascinated
or
repelled
him
indeed
neither
then
nor
at
any
future
time
did
he
succeed
in
deciding
the
question
whilst
he
was
still
contemplating
and
wondering
how
bellamy
of
all
people
in
the
world
had
managed
to
marry
such
a
woman
and
what
previous
acquaintance
george
had
had
with
her
he
saw
the
lady
whisper
something
to
his
cousin
who
at
once
turned
and
introduced
him
he
said
me
introduce
you
to
the
most
charming
lady
of
my
acquaintance
philip
bowed
and
expressed
himself
delighted
whilst
the
lady
curtsied
with
a
mixture
of
grace
and
dignity
that
became
her
infinitely
well
cousin
has
often
spoken
to
me
of
you
caresfoot
but
he
never
told
here
she
hesitated
and
broke
off
did
he
never
tell
you
bellamy
nothing
to
my
disadvantage
i
the
contrary
if
you
wish
to
know
she
said
in
that
tone
of
flattering
frankness
which
is
sometimes
so
charming
in
a
mouth
never
told
me
that
you
were
young
and
handsome
i
fancied
you
forty
at
should
dearly
like
to
tell
you
bellamy
what
my
cousin
george
never
told
but
i
for
fear
i
should
make
bellamy
caresfoot
is
a
luxury
that
husband
is
not
allowed
to
indulge
in
it
is
very
well
for
lovers
but
what
is
a
compliment
in
a
lover
becomes
an
impertinence
in
a
husband
but
if
i
keep
you
here
much
longer
i
shall
be
drawing
the
enmity
of
miss
lee
of
fräulein
von
holtzhausen
too
on
to
my
devoted
head
and
as
that
is
the
only
sort
of
jealousy
i
have
any
fear
of
or
indeed
any
respect
for
being
as
it
is
the
expression
of
the
natural
abhorrence
of
one
woman
for
another
i
had
rather
avoid
philip
followed
the
direction
of
her
sleepy
eyes
and
saw
that
both
miss
lee
and
hilda
appeared
to
be
put
out
the
former
was
talking
absently
to
bellamy
and
glancing
continually
in
the
direction
of
that
wife
the
latter
too
whilst
appearing
to
listen
to
some
compliment
from
george
was
gazing
at
bellamy
with
a
curious
look
of
dislike
and
apprehension
in
her
face
see
what
i
mean
fräulein
von
holtzhausen
actually
looks
as
though
she
were
afraid
of
me
can
you
fancy
any
one
being
afraid
of
me
except
my
husband
of
course
as
you
know
when
a
woman
is
talking
of
men
her
husband
is
excepted
come
we
must
be
going
but
caresfoot
bend
a
little
nearer
if
you
will
accept
it
from
such
a
stranger
i
want
to
give
you
a
bit
of
your
choice
pretty
soon
or
you
will
lose
them
do
you
do
you
mean
nothing
at
all
or
just
as
much
as
you
like
and
for
the
rest
i
use
my
eyes
come
let
us
join
the
a
few
minutes
later
hilda
put
down
her
work
and
declaring
that
she
felt
hot
threw
open
the
french
window
and
went
out
into
the
garden
whither
on
some
pretext
or
other
philip
followed
her
a
lovely
woman
that
is
said
bellamy
with
enthusiasm
to
miss
lee
as
soon
as
philip
was
out
of
earshot
positively
kills
one
i
feel
plain
and
dowdy
as
a
milkmaid
alongside
of
a
when
i
am
in
the
room
with
her
you
miss
lee
i
know
i
never
thought
about
it
but
of
course
she
is
lovely
and
plain
so
there
is
no
possibility
of
comparison
between
i
think
you
rate
yourself
rather
low
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
but
most
women
would
but
satisfy
the
of
a
man
when
she
was
present
i
know
that
i
should
not
care
to
trust
my
admirer
if
i
had
one
however
devoted
he
might
be
for
a
single
day
in
her
company
would
you
really
know
what
you
mean
miss
lee
why
i
mean
nothing
at
all
what
should
i
mean
except
that
beauty
is
a
magnet
which
attracts
all
men
it
serves
them
for
a
standard
of
morality
and
a
test
of
right
and
wrong
men
are
different
from
women
if
a
man
is
faithful
to
one
of
us
it
is
only
because
no
other
woman
of
sufficient
charm
has
become
between
him
and
us
you
can
never
trust
a
dreadful
ideas
you
you
think
so
i
hope
not
i
only
speak
what
i
have
observed
take
the
case
of
fräulein
von
holtzhausen
for
instance
did
you
not
notice
that
whilst
she
was
in
the
room
the
eyes
of
the
three
gentlemen
were
all
fixed
upon
her
and
as
soon
as
she
leaves
it
one
of
them
follows
her
as
the
others
would
have
done
had
they
not
been
forestalled
one
can
not
blame
them
they
are
simply
following
a
natural
law
any
other
man
would
do
the
same
where
such
a
charming
person
is
certainly
did
not
notice
it
indeed
to
speak
the
truth
i
thought
that
they
were
more
occupied
with
me
why
my
dear
miss
lee
set
up
for
being
looking
what
a
strange
idea
but
i
dare
say
you
are
right
it
is
only
one
of
my
theories
based
upon
my
own
casual
observations
and
after
all
men
are
not
a
very
interesting
subject
are
they
talk
of
something
more
for
but
poor
maria
was
too
uncomfortable
and
disturbed
to
talk
of
anything
else
so
she
collapsed
into
silence
and
shortly
after
and
bellamy
and
george
made
their
adieux
meanwhile
philip
and
hilda
had
been
walking
leisurely
down
the
shrubberies
adjoining
the
house
have
you
come
out
she
asked
in
german
a
language
he
understood
well
walk
with
you
why
do
you
speak
to
me
in
german
it
is
my
pleasure
to
do
so
and
i
never
asked
you
to
walk
with
me
you
are
wanted
in
the
you
had
better
go
i
go
hilda
that
is
not
until
you
have
promised
me
not
call
me
hilda
if
you
please
i
am
the
fräulein
von
holtzhausen
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
promise
want
you
to
meet
me
this
evening
at
nine
in
the
think
caresfoot
that
you
are
forgetting
a
little
what
is
due
to
me
to
yourself
miss
lee
do
you
mean
by
due
to
miss
lee
that
she
is
in
love
with
you
and
that
you
have
encouraged
her
in
her
affection
you
need
not
contradict
me
she
tells
me
all
about
hilda
if
you
will
meet
me
i
will
explain
everything
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
be
she
swept
round
upon
him
tossing
her
head
and
stamping
her
dainty
foot
upon
the
gravel
caresfoot
she
said
and
for
all
i
am
not
jealous
and
i
will
not
meet
you
i
have
too
much
respect
for
myself
and
too
little
for
you
and
she
was
gone
face
as
he
stood
looking
after
her
was
not
pleasant
to
see
it
was
very
hard
and
angry
is
she
i
will
give
her
something
to
be
jealous
for
the
proud
minx
and
in
his
vexation
he
knocked
off
the
head
of
a
carnation
with
his
stick
what
you
doing
those
are
my
pet
australian
carnations
at
least
i
think
they
are
australian
how
can
you
destroy
them
like
that
right
maria
i
was
only
plucking
one
for
you
you
put
it
in
your
dress
where
are
the
others
have
all
gone
come
in
it
is
so
hot
out
there
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
think
that
she
is
very
handsome
and
very
clever
i
wonder
where
bellamy
picked
her
know
i
wish
he
picked
her
up
at
all
i
like
her
she
says
unpleasant
things
and
though
i
have
only
seen
her
three
times
she
seems
to
know
all
about
me
and
everybody
else
i
am
not
very
quick
but
do
you
know
just
now
i
thought
that
she
was
insinuating
that
you
were
in
love
with
hilda
not
true
is
it
philip
think
me
forward
if
i
ask
you
if
that
is
true
and
if
i
say
that
if
it
is
it
is
better
that
i
should
know
it
i
be
angry
philip
and
the
girl
stood
before
him
to
await
his
answer
one
hand
pressed
against
her
bosom
to
still
the
beating
of
her
heart
whilst
with
the
other
she
screened
her
blushing
brow
and
philip
too
stood
face
to
face
with
her
sweet
self
with
conscience
and
with
opportunity
whispered
conscience
the
time
before
very
much
harm
is
done
now
is
the
acceptable
time
to
tell
her
all
about
it
and
whilst
forbidding
her
love
to
enlist
her
sympathy
and
friendship
it
will
be
wrong
to
encourage
her
affection
when
you
ardently
love
another
woman
you
can
not
palter
any
whispered
opportunity
shouldering
conscience
aside
the
time
to
secure
her
her
love
and
her
possessions
and
to
reward
hilda
for
her
pride
do
not
sacrifice
yourself
to
an
infatuation
do
not
tell
her
about
would
only
breed
jealousies
you
can
settle
with
her
afterwards
take
the
goods
the
gods
provide
all
this
and
more
passed
through
his
mind
and
he
had
made
his
choice
long
before
the
rich
blood
that
mantled
in
the
cheek
had
sunk
back
to
the
true
breast
from
whence
it
came
oh
instant
of
time
born
to
colour
all
eternity
to
thine
own
hue
for
this
man
thou
hast
come
and
gone
oh
fleeting
moment
bearing
desolation
or
healing
on
thy
wings
how
the
angels
in
whose
charge
lie
the
souls
of
men
must
tremble
and
turn
pale
as
they
mark
thy
flight
through
the
circumstances
of
a
existence
and
thence
taking
thy
secrets
with
thee
away
to
add
thy
fateful
store
to
the
records
of
his
past
he
took
her
hand
the
hand
that
was
pressed
upon
her
bosom
he
said
should
not
get
such
ideas
into
your
head
i
admire
hilda
very
much
and
that
is
all
why
dear
i
have
always
looked
upon
myself
as
half
engaged
to
is
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
and
i
have
only
been
waiting
till
circumstances
would
allow
me
to
do
so
to
ask
you
if
you
think
me
worth
for
a
while
she
made
no
reply
but
only
blushed
the
more
at
last
she
looked
up
a
little
have
made
me
very
happy
that
was
all
she
said
am
very
glad
dear
that
you
can
find
anything
in
me
to
like
but
if
you
do
care
for
me
and
think
me
worth
waiting
for
i
am
going
to
ask
something
of
your
affection
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
trust
me
as
well
as
to
love
me
i
do
not
for
reasons
that
i
will
not
enter
into
but
which
i
beg
you
to
believe
are
perfectly
straightforward
wish
anything
to
be
said
of
our
engagement
at
present
not
even
to
your
friend
hilda
do
you
trust
me
sufficiently
to
agree
to
that
i
trust
you
as
much
as
i
love
you
and
for
years
i
have
loved
you
with
all
my
heart
and
now
dear
please
go
i
want
to
in
the
hall
a
servant
gave
him
a
note
it
was
from
hilda
and
ran
have
changed
my
mind
i
will
meet
you
in
the
this
evening
i
have
something
to
say
to
philip
whistled
as
he
read
it
awkward
he
thought
to
himself
i
am
going
to
marry
maria
she
must
leave
this
but
i
can
not
bear
to
part
with
her
i
love
her
i
love
her
chapter
vi
it
was
some
time
before
philip
could
make
up
his
mind
whether
or
no
he
would
attend
his
tryst
with
hilda
in
the
first
place
he
felt
that
it
was
an
unsafe
proceeding
generally
inasmuch
as
moonlight
meetings
with
so
lovely
a
person
might
should
they
come
to
the
knowledge
of
miss
lee
be
open
to
misconstruction
and
particularly
because
should
she
show
the
least
tenderness
towards
him
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
he
could
not
trust
himself
however
much
he
might
be
engaged
in
another
direction
at
the
affections
can
not
be
outraged
with
impunity
but
have
an
awkward
way
of
asserting
themselves
ties
of
honour
notwithstanding
but
as
a
rule
when
in
our
hearts
we
wish
to
do
anything
that
thing
must
be
bad
indeed
if
we
can
not
find
a
satisfactory
excuse
for
doing
it
and
so
it
was
with
philip
now
thought
he
to
himself
would
be
his
opportunity
to
inform
hilda
of
his
relations
with
maria
lee
and
to
put
an
end
to
his
flirtation
with
her
for
ostensibly
at
any
rate
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
very
serious
is
to
say
though
there
had
been
words
of
love
and
even
on
her
part
a
passionate
avowal
of
affection
wrung
in
an
unguarded
moment
from
the
depths
of
her
proud
heart
there
had
been
no
formal
engagement
it
was
a
thing
that
must
be
done
and
now
was
the
time
to
do
it
and
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
but
when
that
night
he
found
himself
sitting
in
the
appointed
place
and
waiting
for
the
coming
of
the
woman
he
was
about
to
discard
but
whom
he
loved
with
all
the
intensity
of
his
fierce
nature
he
began
to
view
the
matter
in
other
lights
and
to
feel
his
resolution
oozing
from
him
whether
it
was
the
silence
of
the
place
that
told
upon
his
nerves
strained
as
they
were
with
silence
and
more
especially
silence
by
night
is
a
great
unveiler
of
realities
the
dread
of
bitter
words
or
the
prescience
of
the
sharp
pang
of
parting
he
knew
enough
of
hilda
to
know
that
what
he
had
to
say
once
said
she
would
trouble
him
no
it
was
these
things
or
whatever
it
was
that
affected
him
he
grew
most
unaccountably
anxious
and
depressed
moreover
in
this
congenial
condition
of
the
atmosphere
of
his
mind
all
its
darker
and
hidden
characteristics
sprang
into
a
vigorous
growth
superstitions
and
presentiments
crowded
in
upon
him
he
peopled
his
surroundings
with
the
shades
of
intangible
deeds
that
yet
awaited
doing
and
grew
afraid
of
his
own
thoughts
he
would
have
fled
from
the
spot
but
he
could
not
fly
he
could
only
watch
the
flicker
of
the
moonlight
upon
the
peaceful
pool
beside
him
at
last
she
came
with
quick
and
anxious
steps
and
though
but
a
few
minutes
before
he
had
dreaded
her
coming
he
now
welcomed
it
eagerly
for
our
feelings
of
whatever
sort
when
directed
towards
each
other
are
so
superficial
as
compared
with
the
intensity
of
our
fears
when
we
are
terrified
by
calamity
or
the
presence
real
or
fancied
of
the
unknown
that
in
any
moment
of
emergency
more
especially
if
it
be
of
a
mental
kind
we
are
apt
to
welcome
our
worst
enemy
as
a
drowning
man
welcomes
a
spar
last
he
said
with
a
sigh
of
relief
late
you
are
could
not
get
away
there
were
some
people
to
dinner
and
then
in
a
softened
voice
pale
you
look
are
you
ill
only
a
little
after
this
there
was
silence
and
the
pair
stood
facing
one
another
each
occupied
with
their
own
thoughts
and
each
dreading
to
put
them
into
words
once
philip
made
a
beginning
of
speech
but
his
voice
failed
him
the
beating
of
his
heart
seemed
to
choke
his
utterance
at
length
she
leaned
as
though
for
support
against
the
trunk
of
a
in
the
boughs
of
which
the
night
breeze
was
whispering
and
spoke
in
a
cold
clear
voice
asked
me
to
meet
you
here
have
you
anything
to
say
to
me
no
do
not
speak
perhaps
i
had
better
speak
first
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
and
what
i
have
to
say
may
influence
whatever
is
in
your
mind
listen
you
remember
what
passed
between
us
nearly
a
month
ago
when
i
was
so
weak
as
to
let
you
see
how
much
i
loved
you
philip
bowed
his
head
in
assent
good
i
have
come
here
not
to
give
you
any
meeting
but
to
tell
you
that
no
such
words
must
be
spoken
again
and
that
i
am
about
to
make
it
impossible
that
they
should
be
spoken
either
by
you
or
by
me
i
am
going
away
from
here
i
hope
to
away
he
gasped
here
was
the
very
thing
he
hoped
for
coming
to
pass
and
yet
the
words
that
should
have
been
so
full
of
comfort
fell
upon
him
cold
as
ice
and
struck
him
into
misery
why
morning
a
relation
of
mine
is
ill
in
germany
the
only
one
i
have
i
never
saw
him
and
care
nothing
for
him
but
it
will
give
me
a
pretext
and
once
gone
i
shall
not
return
i
have
told
maria
that
i
must
go
she
cried
about
it
poor
at
these
words
all
recollection
of
his
purpose
passed
out
of
mind
all
he
realized
was
that
unless
he
could
alter
her
determination
he
was
about
to
lose
the
woman
he
so
passionately
adored
and
whose
haughty
pride
was
to
him
in
itself
more
charming
than
all
poor
gentle
love
do
not
go
he
said
seizing
her
hand
which
she
immediately
withdrew
not
leave
me
you
know
how
i
love
why
should
i
not
leave
you
even
supposing
it
to
be
true
that
you
do
love
me
to
my
cost
i
love
you
and
am
i
any
longer
to
endure
the
daily
humiliation
of
seeing
myself
the
poor
german
companion
who
has
nothing
but
her
beauty
put
aside
in
favour
of
another
whom
i
also
love
you
say
you
love
me
and
bid
me
stay
now
tell
me
what
is
your
purpose
towards
me
do
you
intend
to
try
to
take
advantage
of
my
infatuation
to
make
me
your
mistress
it
is
i
am
told
a
common
thing
for
such
proposals
to
be
made
to
women
in
my
position
whom
it
would
be
folly
for
wealthy
gentlemen
to
marry
if
so
abandon
that
idea
for
i
tell
you
philip
that
i
would
rather
die
than
so
disgrace
my
ancient
name
to
gratify
myself
i
know
you
english
do
not
think
very
much
of
race
unless
the
bearers
of
the
name
are
rich
but
we
do
and
although
you
would
think
it
a
to
marry
me
i
on
the
other
hand
should
not
be
proud
of
an
alliance
with
you
why
philip
my
ancestors
were
princes
of
royal
blood
when
yours
still
herded
the
swine
in
these
woods
i
can
show
more
than
thirty
quarterings
upon
my
shield
each
the
mark
of
a
noble
house
and
i
will
not
be
the
first
to
put
a
bar
sinister
across
them
now
i
have
spoken
plainly
indelicately
perhaps
and
there
is
only
one
more
word
to
be
said
between
us
and
that
word
is
and
she
held
out
her
hand
he
did
not
seem
to
see
it
indeed
he
had
scarcely
heard
the
latter
part
of
what
she
said
presently
he
lifted
his
face
and
it
bore
traces
of
a
dreadful
inward
struggle
it
was
deadly
pale
and
great
black
rings
had
painted
themselves
beneath
the
troubled
eyes
he
said
hoarsely
go
i
can
not
bear
to
let
you
go
i
will
marry
of
what
you
are
saying
philip
and
do
not
be
rash
i
do
not
wish
to
entrap
you
into
marriage
you
love
money
remember
that
maria
with
all
her
possessions
asks
nothing
better
than
to
become
your
wife
and
that
i
have
absolutely
nothing
but
my
name
and
my
good
looks
look
at
me
and
she
stepped
out
into
a
patch
of
moonlight
that
found
its
way
between
the
trees
and
drawing
the
filmy
shawl
she
wore
from
her
head
and
bare
neck
and
bosom
stood
before
him
in
all
the
brightness
of
her
beauty
shaded
as
it
was
and
made
more
lovely
by
the
shadows
of
the
night
me
very
carefully
she
went
on
with
bitter
sarcasm
into
my
features
and
study
my
form
and
carriage
or
you
may
be
disappointed
with
your
bargain
and
complain
that
you
have
not
got
your
worth
remember
too
that
an
accident
an
illness
and
at
the
best
the
passage
of
a
few
years
may
quite
spoil
my
value
as
a
beautiful
woman
and
reflect
before
i
take
you
at
your
philip
had
sat
or
rather
crouched
himself
down
upon
the
log
of
a
tree
that
lay
outside
the
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hand
as
though
her
loveliness
was
more
than
he
could
bear
to
look
upon
now
however
he
raised
his
eyes
and
let
them
dwell
upon
her
scornful
features
had
rather
he
said
had
rather
lose
my
life
than
lose
you
i
love
you
so
that
i
would
buy
you
at
the
price
even
of
my
honour
when
will
you
marry
me
have
you
made
up
your
mind
so
quickly
are
you
sure
then
and
here
she
changed
her
whole
tone
and
bearing
and
passionately
stretched
out
her
arms
towards
him
dearest
philip
my
life
my
love
i
will
marry
you
when
you
if
you
like
must
promise
me
something
is
it
you
will
keep
the
marriage
a
complete
secret
and
bear
another
name
until
my
death
if
you
do
not
he
will
most
probably
disinherit
do
not
like
your
terms
philip
i
do
not
like
secret
marriages
but
you
are
giving
up
much
to
marry
me
so
i
suppose
i
must
give
up
something
to
marry
solemnly
promise
that
nothing
shall
induce
you
to
reveal
that
you
are
my
wife
until
i
give
you
permission
to
do
so
is
provided
you
do
not
force
me
to
in
philip
laughed
need
not
fear
that
he
said
how
shall
we
arrange
about
getting
married
can
meet
you
in
well
i
will
go
up
early
and
get
a
licence
and
then
on
wednesday
i
can
meet
you
and
we
can
be
you
will
philip
where
shall
i
meet
you
he
gave
her
an
address
which
she
carefully
noted
down
she
said
must
go
it
is
late
yes
you
may
kiss
me
now
there
that
will
do
now
in
another
minute
he
was
gone
have
won
the
game
she
mused
maria
i
am
sorry
for
her
but
perhaps
hers
is
the
better
part
she
will
get
over
it
but
mine
is
a
sad
fate
i
love
passionately
madly
but
i
do
not
trust
the
man
i
love
why
should
our
marriage
be
so
secret
he
can
not
be
entangled
with
maria
or
she
would
have
told
and
she
stretched
out
her
arms
towards
the
path
by
which
he
had
left
her
and
cried
aloud
in
the
native
tongue
that
sounded
so
soft
upon
her
lips
my
darling
if
i
could
only
trust
you
as
well
as
i
love
you
it
is
a
happy
woman
that
i
should
be
chapter
vii
nothing
occurred
to
interfere
with
the
plan
of
action
decided
on
by
hilda
and
philip
no
misadventure
came
to
mock
them
dashing
the
tantalus
cup
of
joy
to
earth
before
their
eyes
on
the
contrary
within
hours
of
the
conversation
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
they
were
as
completely
and
irrevocably
man
and
wife
as
a
special
licence
and
the
curate
of
a
city
church
assisted
by
the
clerk
and
the
could
make
them
then
followed
a
brief
period
of
such
delirium
as
turned
the
london
lodgings
dingy
and
stuffy
as
they
were
in
the
height
of
the
hot
summer
into
an
earthly
paradise
a
garden
of
eden
into
which
alas
the
serpent
had
no
need
to
seek
an
entrance
but
as
was
natural
when
the
first
glory
of
realized
happiness
was
beginning
to
grow
faint
on
their
horizon
the
young
couple
turned
themselves
to
consider
their
position
and
found
in
it
mutually
and
severally
many
things
that
did
not
please
them
for
philip
indeed
it
was
full
of
anxieties
for
he
had
many
complications
to
deal
with
first
there
was
his
secret
engagement
to
maria
lee
of
which
be
it
remembered
his
wife
was
totally
ignorant
and
which
was
in
itself
a
sufficiently
awkward
affair
for
a
married
man
to
have
on
his
hands
then
there
was
the
paramount
need
of
keeping
his
marriage
with
hilda
as
secret
as
the
dead
to
say
nothing
of
the
necessity
of
his
living
for
the
most
part
away
from
his
wife
indeed
his
only
consolation
was
that
he
had
plenty
of
money
on
which
to
support
her
inasmuch
as
his
father
had
from
the
date
of
his
leaving
oxford
made
him
an
allowance
of
one
thousand
a
year
hilda
had
begun
to
discover
that
she
was
not
without
her
troubles
for
one
thing
her
fits
of
moodiness
and
fretful
anxiety
troubled
her
and
led
her
possessed
as
she
was
with
a
more
than
ordinary
share
of
womanly
shrewdness
to
suspect
that
he
was
hiding
something
from
her
but
what
chiefly
vexed
her
proud
nature
was
the
necessity
of
concealment
and
all
its
attendant
petty
falsehoods
and
subterfuges
it
was
not
pleasant
for
hilda
caresfoot
to
have
to
pass
as
roberts
and
to
be
careful
not
to
show
herself
in
public
places
in
the
daytime
where
there
was
a
possibility
of
her
being
seen
by
any
one
who
might
recognize
in
her
striking
figure
the
lady
who
had
lived
with
miss
lee
in
marlshire
it
was
not
pleasant
to
her
to
be
obliged
to
reply
to
maria
affectionate
letters
full
as
they
were
of
entreaty
for
her
return
by
epistles
that
had
to
be
forwarded
to
a
country
town
in
a
remote
district
of
germany
to
be
posted
and
which
were
in
themselves
full
of
lies
that
however
white
they
might
have
seemed
under
all
the
circumstances
she
felt
in
her
conscience
to
be
very
black
indeed
in
short
there
was
in
their
union
none
of
that
sense
of
finality
and
of
security
that
is
under
ordinary
circumstances
the
distinguishing
mark
of
marriage
in
this
country
it
partook
rather
of
the
nature
of
an
illicit
connection
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
of
wedded
bliss
all
these
little
things
had
begun
to
make
themselves
felt
and
in
truth
they
were
but
the
commencement
of
evils
for
one
afternoon
philip
for
the
first
time
since
his
wedding
tore
himself
away
from
his
side
and
paid
a
visit
to
a
club
to
which
he
had
been
recently
elected
here
he
found
no
less
than
three
letters
from
his
father
the
first
requesting
his
return
the
second
commanding
it
in
exceptionally
polite
language
and
the
written
in
mingled
anxiety
and
anger
had
just
announcing
his
intention
should
he
not
hear
of
him
by
return
of
setting
detective
officers
to
work
to
discover
his
whereabouts
from
this
letter
it
appeared
indeed
that
his
cousin
george
had
already
been
despatched
to
london
to
look
for
him
and
on
reference
to
the
hall
porter
he
discovered
that
a
gentleman
answering
to
his
description
had
already
inquired
for
him
several
times
cursing
his
own
folly
in
not
having
kept
up
some
communication
with
his
father
he
made
the
best
of
his
way
back
to
his
lodgings
to
find
hilda
waiting
for
him
somewhat
disconsolately
am
glad
you
have
come
back
love
she
said
drawing
him
towards
her
till
his
dark
curls
mingled
with
her
own
fair
locks
and
kissing
him
upon
the
forehead
have
missed
you
dreadfully
i
understand
how
i
can
have
lived
all
these
years
without
am
afraid
dear
you
will
have
to
live
without
me
for
a
while
now
listen
and
he
read
her
the
letters
he
had
just
received
she
listened
attentively
till
he
had
finished
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
with
some
anxiety
in
her
voice
why
of
course
i
must
go
home
at
what
am
i
to
do
i
know
i
suppose
that
you
must
stop
will
be
pleasant
for
me
will
it
not
dear
it
will
be
pleasant
neither
for
you
nor
me
but
what
can
i
do
you
know
the
man
my
father
is
to
deal
with
if
i
stop
here
in
defiance
to
his
wishes
especially
as
he
has
been
anxious
about
me
there
is
no
knowing
what
might
not
happen
remember
hilda
that
we
have
to
deal
with
george
whose
whole
life
is
devoted
to
secret
endeavours
to
supplant
me
if
i
were
to
give
him
such
an
opportunity
as
i
should
by
stopping
away
now
i
should
deserve
all
i
got
or
rather
all
i
did
not
hilda
sighed
and
acquiesced
had
she
been
a
woman
she
would
have
wept
and
relieved
her
feelings
but
she
was
not
minded
and
so
before
the
post
went
out
he
wrote
an
affectionate
letter
to
his
father
expressing
his
sorrow
at
the
anxiety
at
his
own
negligence
in
not
having
written
to
him
the
fact
of
the
matter
being
he
said
that
he
had
been
taken
up
with
visiting
some
of
his
oxford
friends
and
had
not
till
that
afternoon
been
near
his
club
to
look
for
letters
he
would
however
he
added
return
on
the
morrow
and
make
his
apologies
in
person
this
letter
he
handed
to
his
wife
to
read
you
think
that
will
do
he
asked
when
she
had
finished
yes
she
replied
with
a
touch
of
her
old
sarcasm
is
a
masterpiece
of
philip
looked
very
angry
and
fumed
and
fretted
but
he
made
no
reply
and
on
the
following
morning
he
departed
to
bratham
abbey
philip
philip
said
his
father
under
the
mellow
influence
of
his
fourth
glass
of
port
on
the
night
of
his
arrival
know
well
enough
what
kept
you
up
in
town
well
well
i
complain
young
men
will
be
young
men
but
let
these
affairs
interfere
with
the
business
of
life
remember
maria
lee
my
boy
you
have
serious
interests
in
that
direction
interests
that
must
not
be
trifled
with
interests
that
i
have
a
right
to
expect
you
will
trifle
his
son
made
no
reply
but
sipped
his
wine
in
silence
aching
at
his
heart
for
his
absent
bride
and
wondering
what
his
father
would
say
did
he
really
know
what
had
him
in
after
this
matters
went
on
smoothly
enough
for
a
month
or
more
since
fortunately
for
philip
the
great
maria
lee
question
a
question
that
the
more
he
considered
it
the
more
thorny
did
it
appear
was
for
the
moment
shelved
by
the
absence
of
that
young
lady
on
a
visit
to
her
aunt
in
the
isle
of
wight
twice
during
that
month
he
managed
on
different
pretexts
to
get
up
to
london
and
visit
his
wife
whom
he
found
as
patient
as
was
possible
under
the
circumstances
but
anything
but
happy
indeed
on
the
second
occasion
she
urged
on
him
strongly
the
ignominy
of
her
position
and
even
begged
him
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
to
his
father
offering
to
undertake
the
task
herself
he
refused
equally
warmly
and
some
sharp
words
ensued
to
be
however
quickly
followed
by
a
reconciliation
on
his
return
from
this
second
visit
philip
found
a
note
signed
yours
maria
lee
waiting
for
him
which
announced
that
young
return
and
begged
him
to
come
over
to
lunch
on
the
following
day
he
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
go
and
again
fortune
favoured
him
in
the
person
of
a
diffident
young
lady
who
was
stopping
with
maria
and
who
never
left
her
side
all
that
afternoon
much
to
the
disgust
of
the
latter
and
the
relief
of
philip
one
thing
however
he
was
not
spared
and
that
was
the
perusal
of
last
letter
to
her
friend
written
apparently
from
germany
and
giving
a
lively
description
of
the
daily
life
and
the
state
of
her
health
which
she
said
precluded
all
possibility
of
her
return
alas
he
already
knew
its
every
line
too
well
for
as
hilda
refused
to
undertake
the
task
he
had
but
a
week
before
drafted
it
himself
but
philip
was
growing
hardened
to
deception
and
found
it
possible
to
read
it
from
end
to
end
and
speculate
upon
its
contents
with
maria
without
blush
or
hesitation
but
he
could
not
always
expect
to
find
miss
lee
in
the
custody
of
such
an
obtuse
friend
and
needless
to
say
it
became
a
matter
of
very
serious
importance
to
him
to
know
how
he
should
treat
her
it
occurred
to
him
that
his
safest
course
might
be
to
throw
himself
upon
her
generosity
and
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
but
when
it
came
to
the
point
he
was
too
weak
to
thus
expose
his
shameful
conduct
to
the
woman
whose
heart
he
had
won
and
to
whom
he
was
bound
by
every
tie
of
honour
that
a
gentleman
holds
sacred
he
thought
of
the
scornful
wonder
with
which
she
would
listen
to
his
tale
and
preferred
to
take
the
risk
of
greater
disaster
in
the
future
to
the
certainty
of
present
shame
in
the
end
he
contrived
to
establish
a
species
of
confidential
intimacy
with
maria
which
whilst
it
somewhat
mystified
the
poor
girl
was
not
without
its
charm
inasmuch
as
it
tended
to
transform
the
philip
into
a
hero
of
romance
but
in
the
main
maria
was
to
play
heroine
to
her
hero
herself
as
open
as
the
daylight
it
was
quite
incomprehensible
to
her
why
their
relationship
should
be
kept
such
a
dark
and
mysterious
secret
or
why
if
her
lover
gave
her
a
kiss
it
should
be
done
with
as
many
precautions
as
though
he
were
about
to
commit
a
murder
she
was
a
very
modest
maiden
and
in
her
heart
believed
it
a
wonderful
thing
that
philip
should
have
fallen
in
love
with
thing
to
be
very
proud
of
and
she
felt
it
hard
that
she
should
be
denied
the
gratification
of
openly
acknowledging
her
lover
and
showing
him
off
to
her
friends
after
the
fashion
that
is
so
delightful
to
the
female
mind
but
though
this
consciousness
of
the
deprivation
of
a
lawful
joy
set
up
a
certain
feeling
of
irritation
in
her
mind
she
did
not
allow
it
to
override
her
entire
trust
in
and
love
for
philip
whatever
he
did
was
no
doubt
wise
and
right
but
for
all
that
on
several
occasions
she
took
an
opportunity
to
make
him
acquainted
with
her
views
of
the
matter
and
to
ask
him
questions
that
he
found
it
increasingly
difficult
to
answer
in
this
way
by
the
exercise
of
ceaseless
diplomacy
and
with
the
assistance
of
a
great
deal
of
falsehood
of
the
most
artistic
nature
philip
managed
to
tide
over
the
next
six
months
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
position
was
very
far
from
improved
hilda
was
chafing
more
and
more
at
the
ignominy
of
her
position
maria
was
daily
growing
more
and
more
impatient
to
have
their
engagement
made
public
and
last
but
by
no
means
least
his
father
was
almost
daily
at
him
on
the
subject
of
miss
lee
till
at
length
he
succeeded
in
wringing
from
him
the
confession
that
there
existed
some
sort
of
understanding
between
maria
and
himself
now
the
old
squire
was
a
shrewd
man
of
the
world
and
was
not
therefore
slow
to
guess
that
what
prevented
this
understanding
from
being
openly
acknowledged
as
an
engagement
was
some
entanglement
on
his
part
indeed
it
had
recently
become
clear
to
him
that
london
had
developed
strange
attractions
for
philip
that
this
entanglement
could
be
marriage
was
however
an
idea
that
never
entered
into
his
head
he
had
too
good
an
opinion
of
his
sense
to
believe
it
possible
that
he
would
deliberately
jeopardize
his
inheritance
by
marrying
without
his
permission
but
reluctance
and
obstinacy
annoyed
him
excessively
caresfoot
was
not
a
man
accustomed
to
be
thwarted
indeed
he
had
never
been
thwarted
in
his
life
and
he
did
not
mean
to
be
now
he
had
set
his
heart
upon
this
marriage
and
it
would
have
to
be
a
good
reason
that
could
turn
him
from
his
purpose
accordingly
having
extracted
the
above
information
he
said
no
more
to
philip
but
proceeded
to
lay
his
own
plans
that
very
afternoon
he
commenced
to
put
them
into
action
at
three
he
ordered
the
carriage
and
pair
a
vehicle
that
was
rarely
used
giving
special
directions
that
the
coachman
should
see
that
his
wig
was
properly
curled
an
wig
had
before
now
been
known
to
produce
a
very
bad
effect
upon
nerves
and
also
upon
its
future
prospects
in
life
at
three
precisely
the
heavy
open
carriage
swung
upon
and
drawn
by
two
huge
greys
drew
up
in
front
of
the
and
the
squire
who
was
as
usual
dressed
in
the
and
carried
in
his
hand
his
cane
stepped
solemnly
into
it
and
seated
himself
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
back
seat
not
leaning
back
as
is
the
fashion
of
our
degenerate
days
but
holding
himself
bolt
upright
any
more
imposing
sight
than
this
old
gentleman
presented
thus
seated
and
moving
at
a
stately
pace
through
the
village
street
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
but
it
so
oppressed
the
very
children
that
fear
at
the
spectacle
which
was
an
unwonted
one
for
the
squire
had
not
thus
driven
abroad
in
state
for
some
years
overcame
their
curiosity
and
at
his
approach
they
incontinently
fled
so
soon
as
the
carriage
had
passed
through
the
of
the
abbey
the
squire
ordered
the
coachman
to
drive
to
rewtham
house
whither
in
due
course
he
safely
arrived
he
was
ushered
into
the
whilst
a
servant
went
in
search
of
miss
lee
whom
she
found
walking
in
the
garden
gentleman
to
see
you
am
not
at
home
who
is
it
caresfoot
miss
why
you
say
so
before
and
taking
it
for
granted
that
philip
had
paid
her
an
unexpected
visit
she
started
off
for
the
house
at
a
run
philip
she
exclaimed
as
she
swung
open
the
door
good
of
you
for
at
that
moment
caresfoot
senior
appeared
from
behind
the
back
of
the
door
where
he
had
been
standing
by
the
fireplace
and
made
his
most
imposing
bow
my
dear
maria
was
the
first
time
that
i
have
heard
myself
called
philip
for
many
a
long
year
and
i
fear
that
that
was
by
accident
neither
the
name
nor
the
blush
were
meant
for
me
now
were
they
thought
replied
maria
who
was
still
overwhelmed
with
confusion
thought
that
it
was
philip
your
son
you
know
he
has
not
been
here
for
so
such
a
welcome
waiting
him
it
is
indeed
wonderful
that
he
can
keep
away
and
the
old
squire
bowing
again
with
such
courtly
grace
as
to
drive
what
little
remained
to
poor
maria
after
her
flying
entry
entirely
out
of
her
head
now
my
dear
went
on
her
visitor
fixing
his
piercing
eyes
upon
her
face
your
permission
we
will
sit
down
and
have
a
little
talk
together
you
take
off
your
hat
maria
took
off
her
hat
as
suggested
and
sat
down
meekly
full
under
fire
of
the
glowing
eyes
that
had
produced
such
curious
effects
upon
subjects
so
dissimilar
as
the
late
caresfoot
and
jim
brady
she
could
however
think
of
nothing
appropriate
to
say
dear
the
old
gentleman
continued
presently
subject
upon
which
i
have
taken
upon
myself
to
speak
to
you
is
one
very
nearly
affecting
your
happiness
and
also
of
a
delicate
nature
my
excuse
for
alluding
to
it
must
be
that
you
are
the
child
of
my
old
we
were
great
friends
fifty
years
ago
my
that
i
have
myself
a
near
interest
in
the
matter
do
you
understand
me
not
then
forgive
an
old
man
who
has
no
time
to
waste
if
he
comes
to
the
point
i
mean
i
have
come
to
ask
you
maria
if
any
understanding
or
engagement
exists
between
philip
and
yourself
the
eyes
were
full
upon
her
now
and
she
felt
that
they
were
drawing
her
secret
from
her
as
a
corkscrew
does
a
cork
at
last
it
came
out
with
a
pop
we
are
you
my
dear
how
long
have
you
been
engaged
eight
why
has
the
affair
been
kept
so
secret
know
philip
wished
it
he
told
me
not
to
tell
any
one
i
suppose
that
i
should
not
by
rights
have
told
yourself
easy
my
dear
philip
has
already
told
me
that
there
was
an
understanding
between
you
i
only
wanted
to
hear
the
confirmation
of
such
good
news
from
your
own
lips
young
men
are
great
coxcombs
my
dear
and
apt
to
fancy
things
where
ladies
are
concerned
i
am
rejoiced
to
hear
that
there
is
no
mistake
on
his
am
so
glad
that
you
are
pleased
she
said
shyly
my
dear
said
the
old
gentleman
rising
and
walking
up
and
down
the
room
in
his
excitement
is
not
the
word
for
it
i
am
more
rejoiced
than
if
some
one
had
left
me
another
estate
look
here
maria
i
had
set
my
heart
upon
this
thing
coming
to
pass
i
have
thought
of
it
for
years
i
loved
your
father
and
you
are
like
your
father
girl
ay
i
love
you
too
because
you
are
a
generous
honest
woman
and
will
bring
a
good
strain
of
blood
into
a
family
that
wants
and
i
sometimes
think
wants
honesty
too
and
then
your
land
runs
into
ours
and
as
i
buy
it
i
am
glad
that
it
should
come
in
by
marriage
i
have
always
wanted
to
see
the
abbey
isleworth
and
rewtham
estates
in
a
ring
fence
before
i
died
come
and
give
me
a
kiss

maria
did
as
she
was
bid
will
try
to
be
a
good
daughter
to
you
she
said
i
marry
philip
but
and
here
her
voice
trembled
a
little
want
to
make
you
understand
that
though
this
engagement
exists
i
have
sometimes
thought
of
late
that
perhaps
he
wanted
to
break
it
off
it
off
almost
shouted
the
old
man
his
eyes
flashing
it
off
by
god
the
day
he
plays
fast
and
loose
with
you
that
day
i
leave
the
property
to
his
cousin
george
there
i
frightened
you
i
beg
your
pardon
but
in
his
own
interest
maria
i
advise
you
to
hold
him
fast
to
his
word
to
change
the
subject
your
news
has
freshened
me
up
so
much
that
i
mean
to
have
a
little
company
will
you
come
and
dine
with
me
next
thursday
shall
be
very
glad
you
and
perhaps
till
then
you
will
not
unless
he
happens
to
ask
you
mention
the
subject
of
our
conversation
to
philip
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
him
maria
assented
and
the
squire
took
his
leave
with
the
same
magnificence
of
mien
that
had
marked
his
arrival
chapter
viii
that
evening
his
father
astonished
philip
by
telling
him
that
he
intended
to
give
a
on
that
day
week
see
philip
he
said
with
a
grim
smile
have
only
got
a
year
or
so
at
the
most
before
me
and
i
wish
to
see
a
little
of
my
neighbours
before
i
go
i
have
not
had
much
society
of
late
years
i
mean
to
do
the
thing
well
while
i
am
about
it
and
ask
everybody
in
the
neighbourhood
how
many
can
dine
with
comfort
in
the
old
do
you
suppose
i
should
i
remember
that
we
sat
down
sixty
to
dinner
when
i
came
of
age
but
then
we
were
a
little
crowded
so
we
will
limit
the
number
to
you
going
to
have
fifty
people
to
dinner
asked
philip
aghast
i
shall
ask
you
to
come
and
help
me
to
write
the
invitations
presently
i
have
prepared
a
list
and
will
you
kindly
send
over
to
bell
at
roxham
i
wish
to
speak
to
him
he
must
bring
his
men
over
to
do
up
the
old
hall
a
bit
and
by
the
way
write
to
and
order
a
to
be
here
on
tuesday
and
to
bring
with
him
materials
for
the
best
dinner
for
fifty
people
that
he
can
supply
i
will
see
after
the
wine
myself
we
will
finish
off
that
wonderful
port
my
grandfather
laid
down
now
bustle
about
my
lad
we
have
no
time
to
lose
we
must
get
all
the
notes
out
philip
started
to
execute
his
orders
pretty
well
convinced
in
his
own
mind
that
his
father
was
taking
leave
of
his
senses
who
ever
heard
of
a
dinner
being
given
to
fifty
people
before
especially
in
a
house
where
such
rare
entertainments
had
always
been
of
a
traditionally
select
and
solemn
nature
the
expense
too
reflected
philip
would
be
large
a
man
of
his
age
had
in
his
opinion
no
right
to
make
such
of
money
that
was
so
near
to
belonging
to
somebody
else
but
one
thing
was
clear
his
father
had
set
his
mind
upon
it
and
when
once
that
was
the
case
to
try
to
thwart
him
was
more
than
philip
dared
when
the
notes
of
invitation
arrived
at
their
respective
destinations
great
was
the
excitement
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bratham
abbey
curiosity
was
rampant
on
the
point
and
the
refusals
were
few
and
far
between
at
length
the
eventful
evening
arrived
and
with
it
the
expected
guests
among
whom
the
old
squire
in
his
dress
of
a
past
resplendent
in
diamond
buckles
frilled
and
silk
with
his
hair
and
stately
bearing
himself
by
far
the
most
striking
figure
standing
near
the
door
of
the
large
he
received
his
guests
as
they
arrived
with
an
air
that
would
have
done
credit
to
an
ambassador
but
when
miss
lee
entered
philip
noticed
with
a
prophetic
shudder
that
in
lieu
of
the
accustomed
bow
he
gave
her
a
kiss
he
also
noticed
for
he
was
an
observant
man
that
the
gathered
company
was
pervaded
by
a
curious
air
of
expectation
they
were
nearly
all
of
them
people
who
had
been
neighbours
of
the
caresfoot
family
for
years
many
instances
for
as
intimate
with
its
members
as
the
stiffness
of
english
will
allow
they
therefore
were
well
acquainted
with
the
family
history
and
peculiarities
but
it
was
clear
from
their
faces
that
their
knowledge
was
of
no
help
to
them
now
and
that
they
were
totally
in
the
dark
as
to
why
they
were
all
gathered
together
in
this
unwonted
fashion
at
length
to
the
relief
of
all
the
last
of
the
chosen
fifty
guests
put
in
an
appearance
and
dinner
was
announced
everybody
made
his
way
to
his
allotted
partner
and
awaited
the
signal
to
move
forward
when
a
fresh
piquancy
was
added
to
the
proceedings
by
an
unexpected
which
maria
lee
played
a
principal
part
maria
was
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
wondering
if
philip
was
going
to
take
her
in
to
dinner
and
why
he
had
not
been
to
see
her
lately
when
suddenly
she
became
aware
that
all
the
room
was
looking
at
her
and
on
raising
her
eyes
she
perceived
the
cause
for
there
close
upon
her
and
advancing
with
majestic
step
and
outstretched
arm
was
old
caresfoot
possessed
by
the
evident
intention
of
taking
her
down
in
the
full
face
of
all
the
married
ladies
and
people
of
title
present
she
prayed
that
the
floor
might
open
and
swallow
her
indeed
of
the
two
she
would
have
preferred
that
way
of
going
down
to
dinner
but
it
did
not
so
there
was
no
alternative
left
to
her
but
to
accept
the
proffered
arm
and
to
pass
with
as
much
dignity
as
she
could
muster
in
such
a
trying
moment
in
front
of
the
intensely
interested
which
she
could
hear
an
involuntary
murmur
of
through
the
doors
down
the
great
oak
staircase
loaded
with
exotics
thence
along
a
passage
carpeted
with
crimson
cloth
and
through
double
doors
of
oak
that
were
flung
open
at
their
approach
into
the
on
its
threshold
not
only
she
but
almost
every
member
of
the
company
who
passed
in
behind
them
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
indeed
the
sight
before
them
amply
justified
it
the
hall
was
a
chamber
of
noble
proportions
sixty
feet
in
length
by
thirty
wide
it
was
very
lofty
and
the
dark
chestnut
beams
of
the
beautiful
arched
roof
were
thrown
into
strong
relief
by
the
light
of
many
candles
the
walls
were
panelled
to
the
roof
with
oak
that
had
become
almost
black
in
the
course
of
centuries
here
and
there
relieved
by
portraits
and
shining
suits
of
armour
down
the
centre
of
the
room
ran
a
long
wide
table
whereon
and
on
a
huge
sideboard
was
spread
the
whole
of
the
caresfoot
plate
which
catching
the
light
of
the
suspended
candles
threw
it
back
in
dazzling
gleams
till
the
beholder
was
positively
bewildered
with
the
brilliancy
of
the
sight
how
beautiful
said
maria
in
astonishment
answered
the
old
gentleman
as
he
took
his
seat
at
the
head
of
the
table
placing
maria
on
his
right
plate
is
very
fine
it
has
taken
two
hundred
years
to
get
together
but
my
father
did
more
in
that
way
than
all
of
us
put
together
he
spent
ten
thousand
pounds
on
plate
during
his
lifetime
that
gold
service
on
the
sideboard
belonged
to
him
i
have
only
spent
two
mind
my
love
he
added
in
a
low
voice
it
comes
into
your
keeping
that
it
is
preserved
intact
but
i
recommend
you
to
add
to
it
there
is
too
much
already
for
a
simple
country
maria
blushed
and
was
silent
the
dinner
which
was
served
on
a
most
magnificent
scale
wore
itself
away
as
all
big
do
in
bursts
of
sedate
but
not
profoundly
interesting
conversation
indeed
had
it
not
been
for
the
novelty
of
the
sight
maria
would
have
been
rather
bored
the
stately
compliments
notwithstanding
as
it
was
she
felt
inclined
to
envy
the
party
at
the
other
end
amongst
whom
looking
down
the
long
vista
of
sparkling
glass
and
silver
she
could
now
and
again
catch
sight
of
face
beaming
with
animation
and
even
in
the
pauses
of
conversation
hear
the
echo
of
his
distant
laughter
good
spirits
he
is
in
she
thought
to
herself
and
indeed
philip
was
or
appeared
to
be
in
excellent
spirits
his
handsome
face
that
of
late
had
been
so
gloomy
was
lit
up
with
laughter
and
he
contrived
by
his
witty
talk
to
keep
those
round
him
in
continual
merriment
seems
very
happy
he
said
george
to
bellamy
who
was
sitting
next
to
him
must
be
a
very
bad
judge
of
the
face
as
an
index
to
the
mind
if
you
think
that
he
is
happy
i
have
been
watching
him
all
dinner
and
i
draw
a
very
different
look
how
he
is
you
never
seen
a
man
laugh
to
hide
his
misery
never
mind
his
lips
watch
his
eyes
they
are
dilated
with
fear
see
how
he
keeps
glancing
towards
his
father
and
miss
lee
there
did
you
see
him
start
believe
me
he
is
not
happy
and
unless
i
am
mistaken
he
will
be
even
less
so
before
the
night
is
over
we
are
not
all
asked
here
for
hope
not
i
hope
not
if
so
we
shall
have
to
act
upon
our
information
eh
but
to
change
the
subject
you
look
lovely
course
i
do
i
lovely
i
wish
i
could
return
the
compliment
but
conscientiously
i
did
you
ever
see
such
plate
look
at
that
is
wonderful
said
george
never
saw
it
at
all
out
before
i
wonder
he
added
with
a
sigh
i
shall
ever
have
the
fingering
of
she
said
with
a
strange
look
of
her
large
eyes
you
continue
to
be
guided
by
me
you
shall
i
tell
you
so
and
i
make
mistakes
hush
something
is
going
to
happen
what
is
it
the
dinner
had
come
to
an
end
and
in
accordance
with
the
fashioned
custom
the
cloth
had
been
removed
leaving
bare
an
ancient
table
of
polished
oak
nearly
forty
feet
in
length
and
composed
of
slabs
of
timber
a
good
two
inches
thick
when
the
wine
had
been
handed
round
the
old
squire
motioned
to
the
servants
to
leave
the
room
and
then
having
first
whispered
something
in
the
ear
of
miss
lee
that
caused
her
to
turn
very
red
he
slowly
rose
to
his
feet
in
the
midst
of
a
dead
silence
at
your
face
whispered
bellamy
george
looked
it
was
ghastly
pale
and
the
black
eyes
were
gleaming
like
polished
jet
against
white
paper
and
neighbours
amongst
whom
or
amongst
whose
fathers
i
have
lived
for
so
many
years
began
the
speaker
whose
voice
soft
as
it
was
filled
the
great
hall
with
ease
was
if
tradition
does
not
lie
in
this
very
room
and
at
this
very
table
that
the
only
caresfoot
who
ever
made
an
speech
of
his
own
accord
delivered
himself
of
his
burden
that
man
was
my
ancestor
in
the
eighth
degree
old
yeoman
caresfoot
and
the
occasion
of
his
speech
was
to
him
a
very
important
one
being
the
day
on
which
he
planted
staff
the
great
oak
by
the
water
yonder
to
mark
the
founding
of
a
house
of
country
gentry
some
centuries
have
elapsed
since
my
forefather
stood
where
i
stand
most
like
with
his
hand
upon
this
board
as
mine
is
now
and
addressed
a
company
not
so
fine
or
so
well
dressed
but
mean
no
the
whole
as
good
at
heart
as
that
before
me
now
yes
the
sapling
oak
has
grown
into
the
biggest
tree
in
the
then
and
now
it
seems
therefore
to
be
fit
that
on
what
is
to
me
as
great
a
day
as
the
planting
of
that
oak
was
to
my
yeoman
forefather
that
i
like
him
should
gather
my
ancient
friends
and
neighbours
round
me
under
the
same
ancient
roof
that
i
may
like
him
make
them
the
partakers
of
my
joy
of
you
sitting
at
this
board
can
look
upon
the
old
man
who
now
asks
your
attention
without
realizing
what
he
himself
has
already
learned
namely
that
his
day
is
over
now
life
is
hard
to
quit
when
a
man
grows
old
the
terrors
of
the
unknown
land
loom
just
as
large
and
terrible
as
they
did
to
his
youthful
imagination
larger
perhaps
but
it
is
a
fact
that
must
be
faced
a
hard
inevitable
fact
and
age
realizing
this
looks
round
it
for
consolations
and
finds
only
two
first
that
as
its
interests
and
affections
fade
and
fall
away
in
just
that
same
proportion
do
they
grow
and
gather
upon
the
further
shore
and
secondly
that
after
eternal
fashion
the
youth
and
vigour
of
a
new
generation
is
waiting
to
replace
the
decrepitude
of
that
which
sinks
into
oblivion
my
life
is
done
it
can
not
be
long
before
the
churchyard
claims
its
own
but
i
live
again
in
my
son
and
take
such
cold
comfort
as
i
may
from
that
idea
of
family
and
of
and
assured
succession
that
has
so
largely
helped
to
make
this
country
what
she
is
you
will
wonder
what
can
be
the
particular
purpose
for
which
i
have
bidden
you
here
be
assured
that
it
was
not
to
ask
you
to
listen
to
gloomy
sermons
on
the
to
others
not
very
interesting
fact
of
my
approaching
end
but
rather
for
a
joyful
and
a
definite
reason
one
wish
i
have
long
had
it
before
i
go
i
may
see
my
child
the
little
caresfoot
that
is
to
fill
my
place
in
future
years
prattling
about
my
knees
but
this
i
shall
never
see
what
i
have
to
announce
to
you
however
is
the
first
step
towards
it
my
engagement
to
miss
lee
the
young
lady
on
my
at
his
face
whispered
bellamy
to
her
neighbour
during
the
murmur
of
applause
that
followed
this
announcement
philip
had
put
his
hands
down
upon
his
chair
as
though
to
raise
himself
up
and
an
expression
of
such
mingled
rage
and
terror
swept
across
his
features
as
once
seen
could
not
easily
be
forgotten
but
so
quickly
did
it
pass
that
perhaps
bellamy
who
was
watching
was
the
only
one
in
all
that
company
to
observe
it
in
another
moment
he
was
smiling
and
bowing
his
acknowledgements
to
whispered
and
telegraphed
congratulations
all
know
miss
lee
went
on
the
old
squire
you
knew
her
father
and
mother
before
her
she
is
a
sound
shoot
from
an
honest
stock
a
girl
after
my
own
heart
a
girl
that
i
love
and
that
all
who
come
under
her
influence
will
love
and
this
engagement
is
to
me
the
most
joyful
news
that
i
have
heard
for
many
a
year
may
god
ay
and
man
too
so
deal
with
my
son
as
he
deals
with
maria
lee
now
i
have
done
i
have
already
kept
you
too
long
with
your
consent
we
will
have
no
more
speeches
no
returning
of
thanks
we
will
spare
philip
his
blushes
but
before
i
sit
down
i
will
bid
you
all
farewell
for
i
am
in
my
year
and
i
feel
that
i
shall
never
see
very
many
of
your
faces
again
i
wish
that
i
had
been
a
better
neighbour
to
you
all
as
there
are
many
other
things
i
wish
now
that
it
is
too
late
to
fulfil
them
but
i
still
hope
that
some
of
you
will
now
and
again
find
a
kind
thought
for
the
old
man
whom
among
yourselves
you
talk
of
as
believe
me
my
friends
there
is
truth
in
the
old
proverb
the
devil
is
not
always
as
black
as
he
is
painted
i
give
you
my
toast
my
son
philip
and
his
affianced
wife
maria
the
whole
company
rose
actuated
by
a
common
impulse
and
drank
the
health
standing
and
such
was
the
pathos
of
the
old
speech
that
there
were
eyes
among
those
present
that
were
not
free
from
tears
then
the
ladies
retired
amongst
them
poor
maria
who
was
naturally
upset
at
the
unexpected
and
in
some
ways
unwelcome
notoriety
thus
given
to
herself
in
the
she
was
so
overwhelmed
with
congratulations
that
at
last
feeling
that
she
could
not
face
a
fresh
edition
from
the
male
portion
of
the
gathering
she
ordered
her
carriage
and
quietly
slipped
away
home
to
think
over
matters
at
her
leisure
philip
too
came
in
for
his
share
of
honours
down
below
and
acknowledged
them
as
best
he
might
for
he
had
not
the
moral
courage
to
repudiate
the
position
he
felt
that
his
father
had
forced
his
hand
completely
and
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
and
sank
into
the
outward
calmness
of
despair
but
if
his
companions
could
have
seen
the
whirlpool
of
hatred
terror
and
fury
that
raged
within
his
breast
as
he
sat
and
chatted
and
sipped
his
port
they
would
have
been
justifiably
astonished
at
length
the
banquet
for
it
was
nothing
less
came
to
an
end
and
having
bowed
their
farewell
to
the
last
departing
guest
the
old
man
and
his
son
were
left
alone
together
in
the
deserted
philip
was
seated
by
a
table
his
face
buried
in
his
hand
whilst
his
father
was
standing
by
the
dying
fire
tapping
his
nervously
on
the
mantelpiece
it
was
he
who
broke
the
somewhat
ominous
silence
philip
how
did
you
like
my
speech
thus
addressed
the
son
lifted
his
face
from
his
hand
it
was
white
as
a
sheet
what
authority
he
asked
in
a
harsh
whisper
you
announce
me
as
engaged
to
miss
lee
my
own
philip
i
had
it
from
both
your
lips
that
you
were
engaged
i
did
not
choose
that
it
should
remain
a
secret
any
had
no
right
to
make
that
speech
i
will
not
marry
miss
lee
understand
once
and
for
all
i
will
marry
in
speaking
thus
philip
had
nerved
himself
to
bear
one
of
those
dreadful
outbursts
of
fury
that
had
earned
his
father
his
title
but
to
his
astonishment
none
such
came
the
steely
eyes
glinted
a
little
as
he
answered
in
his
most
polite
manner
and
that
was
all
position
philip
then
is
that
you
are
engaged
very
publicly
engaged
to
a
girl
whom
you
have
no
intention
of
very
disgraceful
position
mine
is
that
i
have
with
every
possible
solemnity
announced
a
marriage
that
will
not
come
very
ridiculous
position
very
good
my
dear
philip
please
yourself
i
can
not
force
you
into
a
disgraceful
marriage
but
you
must
not
suppose
that
you
can
thus
thwart
me
with
impunity
allow
me
to
show
you
the
alternative
i
see
you
are
tired
but
i
shall
not
detain
you
long
take
that
this
house
and
the
land
round
it
also
the
plate
which
is
very
valuable
but
can
not
be
the
way
see
that
it
is
safely
locked
up
before
you
go
to
strictly
entailed
and
must
of
course
belong
to
you
the
value
of
the
entailed
land
is
about
pounds
a
year
or
a
little
less
in
bad
times
of
the
unentailed
a
clear
pounds
of
my
personal
property
about
pounds
should
you
persist
in
your
refusal
to
marry
miss
lee
or
should
the
marriage
in
any
way
fall
through
except
from
circumstances
entirely
beyond
your
control
i
must
to
use
your
own
admirably
emphatic
language
ask
you
to
once
and
for
all
that
where
your
name
appears
in
my
will
with
reference
to
the
unentailed
and
personal
property
it
will
be
erased
and
that
of
your
cousin
george
substituted
please
yourself
philip
please
yourself
it
is
a
matter
of
entire
indifference
to
me
i
am
very
fond
of
george
and
shall
be
glad
to
do
him
a
good
turn
if
you
force
me
to
it
though
it
is
a
pity
to
split
up
the
property
but
probably
you
will
like
to
take
a
week
to
consider
whether
you
prefer
to
stick
to
the
girl
you
have
got
hold
of
up
in
town
yes
i
know
there
is
some
abandon
the
property
or
marry
miss
lee
and
retain
the
very
pretty
problem
for
an
amorous
young
man
to
consider
there
i
keep
you
up
any
longer
good
night
philip
good
night
just
see
to
the
plate
will
you
remember
you
have
a
personal
interest
in
that
i
leave
it
philip
rose
without
a
word
and
left
the
room
but
when
he
was
gone
it
was
his
turn
to
hide
his
face
in
his
hands
god
he
groaned
aloud
think
that
all
my
plans
should
come
to
such
an
end
as
this
to
think
that
i
am
as
powerless
to
prevent
their
collapse
as
a
child
is
to
support
a
falling
tree
that
the
only
power
left
me
is
the
power
of
on
my
own
son
i
have
lived
too
long
and
the
dregs
of
life
are
chapter
ix
poor
hilda
found
life
in
her
london
lodging
anything
but
cheerful
and
frequently
begged
philip
to
allow
her
to
settle
somewhere
in
the
country
this
however
he
refused
to
do
on
two
grounds
in
the
first
place
because
few
country
villages
would
be
so
convenient
for
him
to
get
at
as
london
and
in
the
second
because
he
declared
that
the
great
city
was
the
safest
in
the
world
and
so
hilda
continued
perforce
to
live
her
lonesome
existence
that
was
only
cheered
by
her
short
and
uncertain
visits
friends
she
had
none
nor
did
she
dare
to
make
any
the
only
person
whose
conversation
she
could
rely
on
to
relieve
the
tedium
of
the
long
weeks
was
her
landlady
jacobs
the
widow
of
a
cheesemonger
who
had
ruined
a
fine
business
by
his
drinking
and
other
vicious
propensities
and
out
of
a
good
property
had
only
left
his
wife
the
leasehold
of
a
house
in
inn
fields
which
fortunately
for
her
had
been
settled
upon
her
at
her
marriage
like
most
people
who
have
seen
better
but
what
she
was
now
very
comfortably
delighted
in
talking
of
her
misfortunes
and
of
the
perfidiousness
of
man
and
in
hilda
who
had
poor
girl
nothing
else
to
listen
to
she
found
a
most
attentive
audience
as
was
only
natural
where
such
a
charming
person
and
such
a
good
listener
were
concerned
honest
jacobs
soon
grew
fond
of
her
interesting
lodger
about
whose
circumstances
and
history
she
soon
wove
many
an
imaginary
tale
for
needless
to
say
her
most
pertinent
inquiries
failed
to
extract
much
information
from
hilda
one
of
her
favourite
fictions
was
that
her
lodger
was
the
victim
of
her
handsome
husband
who
had
in
some
way
beguiled
her
from
her
home
beyond
the
seas
in
order
to
keep
her
in
solitary
confinement
and
out
of
the
reach
of
a
hated
rival
another
that
he
kept
her
thus
that
he
might
have
greater
liberty
for
his
own
actions
in
course
of
time
these
ideas
took
such
possession
of
her
mind
that
she
grew
to
believe
in
them
and
when
speaking
of
hilda
to
any
of
her
other
lodgers
would
shake
her
head
and
talk
of
her
mysteriously
as
a
and
a
as
for
that
lady
herself
whilst
far
from
suspecting
her
good
gloomy
surmises
she
certainly
fell
more
and
more
a
prey
to
depression
and
anxieties
and
occasionally
even
to
suspicion
to
all
of
which
evils
she
grew
increasingly
liable
as
she
drew
nearer
to
an
event
that
was
no
longer
very
distant
she
could
not
but
notice
a
change
in
manner
on
the
rare
occasions
when
he
was
able
to
visit
her
of
which
the
most
marked
developments
were
fits
of
silence
and
irritability
a
certain
reticence
also
that
became
more
and
more
noticeable
as
time
went
on
led
her
to
feel
that
there
was
an
invisible
something
growing
up
between
something
that
the
pride
she
possessed
in
such
a
striking
degree
forbade
her
to
attempt
to
pierce
but
which
was
none
the
less
galling
to
her
on
that
account
very
shortly
before
the
events
narrated
in
the
last
chapter
she
had
taken
the
occasion
of
a
visit
from
philip
to
complain
somewhat
bitterly
of
her
position
begging
him
to
tell
her
when
there
was
any
prospect
of
her
being
allowed
to
take
her
rightful
question
her
husband
was
quite
unable
to
answer
satisfactorily
seeing
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
out
of
him
with
womanly
tact
she
changed
the
subject
and
asked
after
maria
lee
for
whom
she
entertained
a
genuine
affection
he
last
saw
her
how
she
was
looking
if
there
was
any
prospect
of
her
getting
married
and
other
questions
of
the
same
result
of
which
was
to
evoke
a
most
violent
and
to
her
inexplicable
fit
of
irritability
on
the
part
of
her
husband
something
of
a
scene
ensued
which
was
finally
terminated
about
five
in
the
afternoon
by
abrupt
departure
to
catch
his
train
shortly
afterwards
jacobs
coming
up
to
bring
some
tea
found
hilda
indulging
in
tears
that
she
had
been
too
proud
to
shed
before
her
husband
and
having
had
an
extended
personal
experience
of
such
matters
rightly
guessed
that
there
had
been
a
conjugal
tiff
the
blame
of
which
needless
to
say
she
fixed
upon
the
departed
philip
as
hilda
was
called
she
said
take
on
like
that
all
brutes
what
they
are
if
only
you
could
have
seen
my
samuel
dead
and
gone
these
ten
years
and
buried
in
a
private
grave
at
kensal
he
leave
anything
to
pay
for
it
except
three
dozen
and
five
of
was
a
beauty
poor
dear
he
was
your
husband
nothing
to
husband
let
me
tell
you
jacobs
is
not
a
brute
at
all
sobbed
hilda
with
dignity
roberts
that
is
just
what
i
used
to
say
of
samuel
but
he
was
the
biggest
brute
in
the
three
kingdoms
for
all
that
but
if
you
ask
me
meaning
no
offence
i
call
a
man
a
brute
as
only
comes
to
see
his
lawful
wife
about
twice
a
month
let
alone
making
an
angel
roberts
has
his
reasons
jacobs
you
must
not
talk
of
him
like
so
my
samuel
used
to
say
when
he
stopped
away
from
home
for
three
nights
at
a
time
till
i
followed
him
and
found
out
his
and
a
mighty
pretty
she
was
too
all
paint
and
feathers
the
hussy
and
eyes
as
big
as
a
teacup
they
all
have
their
reasons
but
they
never
tell
but
come
and
put
on
your
things
and
go
out
a
bit
a
dear
it
is
a
beautiful
warm
evening
you
feel
never
mind
that
it
is
necessary
for
people
as
is
in
an
interested
way
to
take
exercise
i
well
here
hilda
however
cut
the
subject
short
and
deprived
herself
of
reminiscences
by
going
to
put
on
her
things
it
was
a
bright
warm
evening
and
she
found
the
air
so
pleasant
that
after
strolling
round
inn
fields
she
thought
she
would
extend
her
walk
a
little
and
struck
past
inn
hall
into
new
square
and
then
made
her
way
to
the
archway
opposite
to
where
the
new
law
courts
now
stand
under
this
archway
a
legal
bookseller
has
built
his
nest
and
behind
windows
of
broad
were
ranged
specimens
of
his
seductive
wares
baits
on
which
to
catch
students
avaricious
of
legal
knowledge
as
they
pass
on
their
way
to
chambers
or
hall
now
at
this
window
a
young
man
was
standing
at
the
moment
that
hilda
entered
the
archway
his
eyes
fixed
upon
a
pamphlet
on
the
laws
of
succession
that
young
man
was
george
caresfoot
who
was
considering
whether
it
would
be
worth
his
while
to
buy
the
pamphlet
in
order
to
see
if
he
would
be
entitled
to
anything
if
his
uncle
should
happen
to
die
intestate
as
he
sometimes
feared
might
be
the
case
he
had
come
up
to
town
on
business
connected
with
his
firm
and
was
now
waiting
till
it
was
time
to
begin
an
evening
of
what
he
understood
as
pleasure
for
george
was
a
very
gay
young
man
he
was
however
also
a
very
sharp
one
so
sharp
that
he
even
noticed
shadows
especially
when
as
in
this
case
the
shadow
was
clearly
defined
and
flung
on
the
dark
background
of
the
books
before
him
he
watched
it
for
a
moment
and
as
its
owner
with
an
absent
air
slowly
passed
from
the
bright
sunlight
into
the
shade
of
the
arch
it
struck
the
astute
george
that
there
was
something
familiar
about
this
particular
and
by
no
means
unpleasing
shadow
waiting
till
it
had
vanished
and
the
footsteps
gone
past
him
he
turned
round
and
at
a
glance
recognized
hilda
von
holtzhausen
miss
beautiful
companion
who
was
supposed
to
have
departed
into
the
more
distant
parts
of
germany
eyes
twinkled
and
a
whole
host
of
ideas
rushed
into
his
really
able
mind
at
last
for
a
sovereign
he
muttered
meanwhile
hilda
walked
slowly
on
into
chancery
lane
then
turned
to
the
left
till
she
came
into
holborn
and
thence
made
her
way
round
by
another
route
back
to
inn
fields
needless
to
say
george
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
his
first
impulse
had
been
to
go
up
and
speak
to
her
but
he
resisted
the
inclination
on
the
doorstep
of
the
house
where
hilda
lodged
stood
her
landlady
giving
a
piece
of
her
mind
to
a
both
as
regarded
his
meat
and
his
personal
qualities
she
paused
for
breath
just
as
hilda
passed
up
the
steps
and
turning
said
something
that
made
the
latter
laugh
the
took
the
opportunity
of
beating
a
rapid
retreat
leaving
jacobs
crowing
after
him
from
her
own
doorstep
as
soon
as
hilda
had
gone
into
the
house
george
saw
his
opportunity
advancing
politely
towards
jacobs
he
asked
her
if
she
was
the
landlady
of
the
house
and
when
she
had
answered
in
the
affirmative
he
made
inquiries
about
apartments
you
sir
said
jacobs
i
do
not
let
rooms
to
single
take
too
much
for
granted
i
am
she
looked
at
him
doubtfully
suppose
sir
you
would
have
no
objection
to
giving
a
dozen
if
you
like
but
shall
we
look
at
the
rooms
jacobs
assented
and
they
made
their
way
upstairs
george
keeping
in
front
on
the
he
saw
a
pair
of
shoes
on
a
mat
outside
the
door
and
guessed
to
whom
they
belonged
these
the
rooms
he
said
laying
his
hand
upon
the
sir
no
they
are
next
floor
please
roberts
suppose
the
very
handsome
young
lady
i
saw
come
into
the
house
no
offence
but
a
bound
to
be
careful
where
he
brings
his
wife
i
suppose
all
yes
poor
dear
answered
jacobs
in
indignation
they
came
here
straight
from
battersea
the
day
they
were
married
a
runaway
match
i
all
right
she
looked
charming
i
hope
her
husband
is
worthy
of
her
remarked
george
as
he
gazed
round
rooms
as
to
that
handsome
enough
for
them
as
likes
those
black
men
but
i
like
people
as
only
comes
to
visit
their
lawful
wives
about
twice
a
month
but
suddenly
checking
herself
any
affair
of
indeed
very
reprehensible
i
am
as
a
married
man
entirely
of
your
mind
these
are
charming
rooms
charming
i
shall
certainly
take
them
if
my
wife
approves
i
will
let
you
know
by
yes
i
have
it
down
good
evening
and
he
was
gone
instead
of
going
out
that
evening
as
he
had
intended
george
sat
in
the
of
his
hotel
and
thought
he
also
wrote
a
letter
which
he
addressed
to
bellamy
next
morning
taking
a
cab
he
drove
to
battersea
and
inspected
the
register
presently
he
asked
for
a
certified
copy
of
the
following
entry
philip
caresfoot
bachelor
gentleman
to
hilda
von
holtzhausen
spinster
by
license
signed
j
few
curate
as
witness
fred
natt
eliza
that
evening
hilda
received
an
anonymous
letter
written
in
a
round
hand
that
had
been
posted
in
the
city
it
was
addressed
to
roberts
and
its
contents
ran
thus
sincere
friend
warns
philip
caresfoot
that
her
husband
is
deceiving
her
and
has
become
entangled
with
a
young
lady
of
her
acquaintance
this
wait
and
watch
the
letter
fell
from
her
hands
as
though
it
had
stung
her
jacobs
was
right
she
said
aloud
with
a
bitter
laugh
always
have
a
oh
let
him
beware
and
she
threw
back
her
beautiful
head
and
the
great
blue
eyes
sparkled
like
those
of
a
snake
about
to
strike
the
sword
of
jealousy
that
she
had
hitherto
repelled
with
the
shield
of
a
trust
in
the
man
she
loves
had
entered
into
her
soul
and
could
philip
have
seen
her
under
these
new
circumstances
he
would
have
realized
that
he
had
indeed
good
reason
to
wonder
she
went
on
wonder
that
he
finds
her
name
irritating
upon
my
lips
no
doubt
to
him
it
is
a
desecration
oh
oh
and
she
flung
herself
on
her
face
and
wept
tears
of
jealous
rage
said
george
to
bellamy
as
they
drove
home
together
after
the
great
dinner
party
do
not
be
shocked
my
reader
bellamy
was
the
how
shall
we
strike
shall
i
go
to
the
old
man
and
show
him
my
certified
copy
there
is
no
time
to
lose
he
might
die
any
we
must
act
through
is
more
scientific
and
it
will
be
more
thing
it
will
be
a
blow
to
her
you
like
her
not
she
did
not
trust
me
and
because
she
eclipses
me
therefore
i
am
glad
of
an
opportunity
of
destroying
are
a
very
ruthless
i
have
an
end
in
view
i
march
straight
to
it
i
do
not
is
all
but
never
mind
me
here
we
are
near
home
go
to
town
by
the
first
train
morning
and
post
another
letter
announcing
what
has
happened
here
then
come
back
and
reflected
george
is
a
wonderful
woman
it
is
good
to
have
some
hold
we
left
hilda
stretched
on
her
face
sobbing
but
the
fit
did
not
last
long
she
rose
and
flung
open
the
window
she
seemed
stifled
for
want
of
air
then
she
sat
down
to
think
what
she
should
do
vanish
and
leave
no
trace
no
not
yet
appear
and
claim
her
place
no
not
yet
the
time
was
not
ripe
for
choice
between
these
two
extremes
upbraid
philip
with
his
faithlessness
no
not
without
proofs
what
did
that
hateful
letter
say
and
watch
yes
that
was
what
she
would
do
but
she
could
not
wait
here
she
felt
as
though
she
must
go
somewhere
get
some
change
of
scene
or
she
should
break
down
she
had
heard
jacobs
speak
of
a
village
not
more
than
two
hours
from
london
that
a
convalescent
lodger
of
hers
had
visited
and
found
charming
she
would
go
there
for
a
week
and
watch
the
spring
cast
her
mantle
over
the
earth
and
listen
to
the
laughter
of
the
brooks
and
try
to
forget
her
burning
love
and
jealousy
and
just
for
that
one
week
be
happy
as
she
was
when
as
a
little
girl
she
roamed
all
day
through
the
woods
of
her
native
germany
alas
she
forgot
that
it
is
the
heart
and
not
the
scene
that
makes
happiness
that
evening
she
wrote
a
note
to
her
husband
saying
that
she
felt
that
change
of
air
was
necessary
for
her
and
that
she
was
going
out
of
london
for
a
few
days
to
some
quiet
place
from
whence
she
would
write
to
him
he
must
not
however
expect
many
letters
as
she
wanted
complete
rest
on
the
following
morning
she
went
and
if
the
sweet
spring
air
did
not
bring
peace
to
her
mind
at
any
rate
it
to
a
very
great
extent
set
her
up
in
strength
she
wrote
but
one
letter
during
her
absence
and
that
was
to
say
that
she
should
be
back
in
london
by
midday
on
the
first
of
may
this
letter
reached
philip
on
the
morning
of
the
great
and
was
either
accidentally
or
on
purpose
sent
without
the
address
on
the
morning
of
the
first
of
is
two
days
after
the
which
was
given
on
the
of
rose
early
and
commenced
to
pack
her
things
with
the
assistance
of
a
stout
servant
girl
who
did
all
the
odd
jobs
and
a
great
deal
of
the
work
in
the
farmhouse
in
which
she
was
staying
presently
the
cowboy
came
whistling
up
the
little
garden
bright
with
crocuses
and
tulips
that
lay
in
front
of
the
house
and
knocked
at
the
front
door
said
the
stout
girl
in
accents
of
deep
surprise
as
she
drew
her
head
in
from
the
open
lattice
got
a
it
is
for
me
suggested
hilda
a
little
nervously
she
had
grown
nervous
about
the
post
of
late
you
go
and
see
the
letter
was
for
her
in
the
handwriting
of
jacobs
she
opened
it
it
contained
another
addressed
in
the
character
the
sight
of
which
made
her
feel
sick
and
faint
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
read
it
in
the
presence
of
the
girl
she
said
feel
rather
faint
i
shall
lie
down
a
little
i
will
ring
for
you
sally
retired
and
she
opened
her
letter
fifteen
minutes
after
the
girl
received
her
summons
she
found
hilda
very
pale
and
with
a
curious
look
upon
her
face
hope
better
mum
she
said
for
she
was
a
girl
yes
thank
you
sally
i
am
cured
quite
cured
but
please
be
quick
with
the
things
for
i
shall
leave
by
the
nine
chapter
x
the
night
of
the
was
a
nearly
sleepless
one
for
philip
although
his
father
had
so
considerately
regretted
his
wearied
appearance
he
could
do
nothing
but
walk
walk
walk
like
some
unquiet
ghost
up
and
down
his
great
bedroom
till
about
dawn
his
legs
gave
way
beneath
him
and
think
think
think
till
his
mind
recoiled
confused
and
helpless
from
the
dead
wall
of
its
objects
and
out
of
all
this
walking
and
thinking
there
emerged
after
an
hour
of
stupor
that
it
would
be
a
misnomer
to
call
sleep
two
fixed
results
the
first
of
these
was
that
he
hated
his
father
as
a
lost
soul
must
hate
its
torturing
demon
blindly
madly
impotently
hated
him
and
the
second
that
he
could
no
longer
delay
taking
his
wife
into
his
confidence
then
he
remembered
the
letter
he
had
received
from
her
on
the
previous
morning
he
got
it
and
saw
that
it
bore
no
address
merely
stating
that
she
would
be
in
london
by
midday
on
the
first
of
may
that
was
on
the
morrow
till
then
it
was
clear
he
must
wait
and
he
was
not
sorry
for
the
reprieve
his
was
not
a
pleasant
story
for
a
husband
to
have
to
tell
fortunately
for
philip
there
was
an
engagement
of
long
standing
for
this
day
the
thirtieth
of
april
to
go
in
conjunction
with
other
persons
to
effect
a
valuation
of
the
fallows
of
a
large
tenant
who
was
going
out
at
michaelmas
this
prevented
any
call
being
made
upon
him
to
go
and
see
maria
lee
as
after
the
events
of
the
previous
evening
it
might
have
been
expected
he
would
he
started
early
on
this
business
and
did
not
return
till
late
so
he
saw
nothing
of
his
father
that
day
on
the
morning
of
the
first
of
may
he
breakfasted
about
eight
and
then
without
seeing
his
father
drove
to
roxham
to
catch
a
train
that
got
him
up
to
london
about
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
as
he
steamed
slowly
into
paddington
station
another
train
steamed
out
and
had
he
been
careful
to
examine
the
occupants
of
the
carriages
as
they
passed
him
in
a
slow
procession
he
might
have
seen
something
that
would
have
interested
him
but
he
was
not
unnaturally
too
much
occupied
with
his
own
thoughts
to
allow
of
the
indulgence
of
an
idle
curiosity
on
the
arrival
of
his
train
he
took
a
cab
and
drove
without
delay
to
the
house
in
inn
fields
and
asked
for
roberts
back
yet
sir
was
reply
got
this
note
from
her
this
morning
to
say
that
she
would
be
here
by
twelve
but
twenty
past
now
so
i
suppose
that
she
has
missed
the
train
or
changed
her
mind
but
there
will
be
another
in
at
three
so
perhaps
you
had
best
wait
for
that
philip
was
put
out
by
this
contretemps
but
at
the
same
time
he
was
relieved
to
find
that
he
had
a
space
to
breathe
in
before
the
inevitable
and
dreadful
moment
of
exposure
and
infamy
for
he
had
grown
afraid
of
his
wife
three
came
in
due
course
but
no
hilda
philip
was
seriously
disturbed
but
there
was
now
no
train
by
which
she
could
arrive
that
day
so
he
was
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
she
had
postponed
her
departure
there
were
now
two
things
to
be
done
one
to
follow
her
down
to
where
she
was
he
had
ascertained
her
address
from
jacobs
the
other
to
return
home
and
come
back
on
the
morrow
for
reasons
which
appeared
to
him
imperative
but
which
need
not
be
entered
into
here
he
decided
on
the
latter
course
so
leaving
a
note
for
his
wife
he
drove
in
a
very
bad
temper
back
to
paddington
in
time
to
catch
the
five
train
to
roxham
let
us
now
return
to
the
abbey
house
where
whilst
philip
was
cooling
his
heels
in
inn
fields
a
rather
curious
scene
was
in
progress
at
one
old
caresfoot
as
was
his
rule
sat
down
to
lunch
which
frugal
as
it
was
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
was
yet
served
with
some
ceremony
by
a
butler
and
a
footman
just
as
the
meal
was
coming
to
an
end
a
fly
with
some
luggage
on
it
drove
up
to
the
the
footman
went
to
open
it
said
the
squire
to
the
old
butler
out
and
tell
me
who
that
simmons
did
as
he
was
bid
and
replied
rightly
know
squire
but
a
lady
and
she
be
wonderful
just
then
the
footman
returned
and
said
that
a
lady
who
would
not
give
her
name
wished
to
speak
to
him
in
private
you
sure
the
lady
did
not
mean
philip
sir
she
asked
for
philip
first
and
when
i
told
her
that
he
was
out
she
asked
for
you
sir
i
have
shown
her
into
the
at
any
rate
she
has
come
off
a
journey
and
must
be
hungry
set
another
place
and
ask
her
in
in
another
moment
there
was
a
rustle
of
a
silk
dress
and
a
lady
arrayed
in
a
long
cloak
and
with
a
thick
veil
on
was
shown
into
the
room
caresfoot
rising
with
that
courteous
air
for
which
he
was
remarkable
bowed
and
begged
her
to
be
seated
and
then
motioned
to
the
servants
to
leave
the
room
i
am
told
that
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
might
i
ask
whom
i
have
the
honour
of
addressing
she
with
a
rapid
motion
removed
her
hat
and
veil
and
exposed
her
sternly
beautiful
face
to
his
inquiring
gaze
you
not
know
me
caresfoot
she
said
in
her
foreign
accent
yes
you
are
the
young
lady
who
lived
with
maria
miss
von
my
name
it
is
now
hilda
caresfoot
i
am
your
son
as
this
astounding
news
broke
upon
his
ears
her
face
became
a
shifting
study
incredulity
wonder
fury
all
swept
across
it
and
then
in
a
single
second
it
seemed
to
freeze
next
moment
he
spoke
with
overpowering
politeness
madam
then
i
have
to
congratulate
myself
on
the
possession
of
a
very
lovely
a
silence
ensued
that
they
were
both
too
moved
to
break
at
last
the
old
man
said
in
an
altered
tone
have
much
to
talk
of
and
you
must
be
tired
take
off
your
cloak
and
eat
whilst
i
she
obeyed
him
and
he
saw
that
not
only
was
she
his
wife
but
that
she
must
before
long
present
the
world
with
an
heir
to
the
name
of
caresfoot
this
made
him
think
the
more
but
meanwhile
he
continued
to
attend
to
her
wants
she
ate
little
but
calmly
woman
has
nerve
said
he
to
himself
then
he
rang
the
bell
and
bade
simmons
wait
till
he
had
written
a
note
james
to
roxham
at
once
with
this
take
this
things
off
the
fly
and
put
them
in
the
red
bedroom
by
the
way
i
am
at
home
to
nobody
except
bellamy
and
then
turning
to
hilda
if
you
will
come
into
my
study
we
will
continue
our
chat
and
he
offered
her
his
arm
we
are
secure
from
interruption
he
said
with
a
ghost
of
a
smile
this
chair
now
forgive
my
impertinence
but
i
must
ask
you
if
i
am
to
understand
that
you
are
my
wife
she
flushed
a
little
as
she
answered
i
am
i
have
been
careful
to
bring
the
proof
here
it
is
and
she
took
from
a
little
a
certified
copy
of
the
register
of
her
marriage
and
gave
it
to
him
he
examined
it
carefully
through
his
gold
and
handed
it
back
in
order
hum
some
eight
months
since
i
see
may
i
ask
why
i
am
now
for
the
first
time
favoured
with
a
sight
of
this
interesting
short
why
you
come
down
like
an
angel
from
the
clouds
and
reveal
yourself
at
the
present
moment
have
come
she
answered
of
and
she
handed
him
two
letters
have
come
to
ascertain
if
they
are
true
if
my
husband
is
a
doubly
perjured
or
a
basely
slandered
he
read
the
two
anonymous
letters
with
the
contents
of
the
first
we
are
acquainted
the
second
merely
told
of
the
public
announcement
of
engagement
she
said
with
desperate
energy
the
calm
of
her
face
breaking
up
like
ice
before
a
rush
of
waters
must
know
everything
tell
me
my
fate
these
villanous
letters
are
in
every
particular
true
you
have
married
in
my
son
the
biggest
scoundrel
in
the
county
i
can
only
say
that
i
grieve
for
she
listened
in
silence
then
rising
from
her
chair
said
with
a
gesture
infinitely
tragic
in
its
simplicity
it
is
finished
before
god
and
man
i
renounce
him
listen
she
went
on
turning
to
her
loved
your
son
he
won
my
heart
but
though
he
said
he
loved
me
i
suspected
him
of
playing
fast
and
loose
with
me
on
the
one
hand
and
with
my
friend
maria
lee
on
the
other
so
i
determined
to
go
away
and
told
him
so
then
it
was
that
he
offered
to
marry
me
at
once
if
i
would
change
my
purpose
i
loved
him
and
i
because
i
loved
him
so
i
consented
to
even
more
i
agreed
to
keep
the
marriage
secret
from
you
you
see
what
it
has
led
to
i
a
von
holtzhausen
and
the
last
of
my
name
stand
here
a
byword
and
a
scorn
my
story
will
be
found
amusing
at
every
in
the
and
my
shame
will
even
cling
to
my
unborn
child
this
is
the
return
he
has
made
me
for
my
sacrifice
of
and
for
consenting
to
marry
him
at
all
to
outrage
my
love
and
make
me
a
public
have
been
accustomed
broke
in
the
old
squire
his
pride
somewhat
nettled
consider
our
own
a
good
family
to
marry
into
you
do
not
seem
to
share
that
yes
there
is
plenty
of
your
money
for
those
who
care
for
it
but
sir
as
i
told
your
son
it
is
not
a
he
did
me
no
honour
in
marrying
me
though
i
was
nothing
but
a
german
companion
with
no
dower
but
her
beauty
i
here
she
flung
her
head
back
with
an
air
of
ineffable
him
the
honour
my
ancestors
sir
were
princes
when
his
were
well
answered
the
old
man
testily
generations
of
country
gentry
and
the
lord
only
knows
how
many
more
of
stout
yeomen
before
them
is
a
good
enough
descent
for
us
but
i
like
your
pride
and
i
am
glad
that
you
spring
from
an
ancient
race
you
have
been
shamefully
treated
not

before
he
rang
the
bell
and
sent
for
the
housekeeper
she
came
presently
a
woman
of
about
thirty
years
of
age
with
a
comely
face
and
honest
eyes
lady
pigott
said
the
old
squire
addressing
her
philip

kind

pigott
replied
curtseying

pleased
to

along
with
me
hilda
rose
and
took
arm
excitement
and
fatigue
had
worn
her
out
before
she
went
however
she
turned
and
with
tears
in
her
eyes
thanked
the
old
man
for
his
kindness
to
a
friendless
woman
the
hard
eyes
grew
kindly
as
he
stooped
and
kissed
the
broad
white
brow
and
said
in
his
stately
dear
as
yet
i
have
shown
you
nothing
but
the
courtesy
due
to
a
lady
should
i
live
i
hope
to
bestow
on
you
the
affection
i
owe
to
a
daughter
and
thus
they
parted
little
knowing
where
they
should
meet
again
woman

or

the
blood
will
said
as
soon
as
the
door
had
closed
maria
too
the
scoundrel
there
it
is
again
and
he
pressed
his
hand
to
his
heart
business
has
upset
me
and
no
the
pang
passed
and
sitting
down
he
wrote
a
letter
that
evidently
embarrassed
him
considerably
and
addressed
it
to
miss
lee
this
he
put
in
the
and
then
going
to
a
secretaire
he
unlocked
it
and
taking
out
a
document
he
began
to
puzzle
over
it
attentively
presently
simmons
announced
that
bellamy
was
waiting
him
in
at
once
said
the
old
man
briskly
chapter
xi
it
was
some
minutes
past
seven
that
evening
when
the
lawyer
left
and
he
had
not
been
gone
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
a
hired
gig
drove
up
to
the
door
containing
philip
who
had
got
back
from
town
in
the
worst
of
bad
tempers
and
as
no
conveyance
was
waiting
for
him
had
been
forced
to
post
over
from
roxham
apparently
his
father
had
been
expecting
his
arrival
for
the
moment
the
servant
opened
the
door
he
appeared
from
his
study
and
addressed
him
in
a
tone
that
was
as
near
to
being
jovial
as
he
ever
went
philip
back
again
are
you
been
up
to
town
i
suppose
and
driven
over
in
the
gig
lucky
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
come
in
here
a
good
fellow
i
want
to
speak
to
is
he
so
infernally
genial
reflected
philip
danaos
et
dona
ferentes
then
aloud
right
father
but
if
it
is
all
the
same
to
you
i
should
like
to
get
some
dinner
why
i
have
had
none
yet
i
have
been
too
busy
i
shall
not
keep
you
long
we
will
dine
together
philip
was
surprised
and
glanced
at
him
suspiciously
his
habits
were
extremely
regular
why
had
he
had
no
dinner
meanwhile
his
father
led
the
way
into
the
study
muttering
below
his
more
last
a
wood
fire
was
burning
brightly
on
the
hearth
for
the
evening
was
chilly
and
some
sherry
and
glasses
stood
upon
the
table
a
glass
of
wine
philip
i
am
going
to
have
one
it
is
a
good
thing
to
begin
a
conversation
on
what
says
the
psalmist
that
maketh
glad
the
heart
of
man
and
oil
to
make
him
a
cheerful
cheerful
countenance
ho
ho
my
old
limbs
are
tired
i
am
going
to
sit
to
sit
he
seated
himself
in
a
leather
by
the
side
of
the
fire
so
that
his
back
was
towards
the
dying
daylight
but
the
brightness
of
the
flames
threw
the
features
into
strong
relief
against
the
gloom
and
by
it
philip
could
see
that
the
withered
cheeks
were
flushed
somehow
the
whole
strongly
defined
scene
made
him
feel
uncanny
and
restless
for
the
first
of
may
it
lad
the
world
is
very
cold
at
a
great
age
yet
it
seems
but
the
other
day
that
i
used
to
sit
in
this
very
chair
and
dandle
you
upon
my
knee
and
make
this
repeater
strike
for
you
and
yet
that
is
twenty
years
since
and
i
have
lived
through
four
twenties
and
two
years
a
great
age
a
cold
world
you
well
asked
his
son
brusquely
but
not
unkindly
ah
yes
thank
you
philip
i
never
felt
better
my
memory
is
so
good
i
can
see
things
i
have
forgotten
seventy
years
or
more
dear
dear
it
was
behind
that
bookcase
in
a
hole
in
the
board
that
i
used
to
hide
my
flint
and
steel
which
i
used
for
making
little
fires
at
the
foot
of
staff
there
is
a
mark
on
the
bark
now
i
was
mischievous
as
a
little
lad
and
thought
that
the
old
tree
would
make
a
fine
blaze
i
was
audacious
too
and
delighted
to
hide
the
things
in
my
study
under
the
very
nose
of
authority
ay
and
other
memories
come
upon
me
as
i
think
it
was
here
upon
this
very
table
that
they
stood
my
coffin
i
was
standing
where
you
are
now
when
i
wrenched
open
the
shell
to
kiss
her
once
more
before
they
screwed
her
down
for
ever
i
wonder
would
you
do
as
much
for
me
i
loved
my
mother
and
that
was
fifty
years
ago
i
wonder
shall
we
meet
again
that
was
on
the
first
of
may
a
first
of
may
they
threw
branches
of
blackthorn
bloom
upon
her
coffin
odd
very
odd
but
business
lad
was
it
ah
i
know
and
his
manner
changed
in
a
second
and
became
hard
and
stern
maria
have
you
come
to
a
decision
philip
moved
restlessly
on
his
chair
poked
the
logs
to
a
brighter
blaze
and
threw
on
a
handful
of
pine
chips
from
a
basket
by
his
side
before
he
answered
then
he
i
have
reluctance
is
very
strange
philip
i
can
not
understand
it
i
suppose
that
you
are
not
already
married
are
you
philip
there
was
a
lurid
calm
about
the
old
face
as
he
asked
this
question
that
was
very
dreadful
in
its
intensity
under
the
shadow
of
his
thick
black
eyebrows
gleams
of
light
glinted
and
flickered
in
the
expanded
pupils
as
before
the
outburst
of
a
tempest
the
forked
lightning
flickers
in
the
belly
of
the
cloud
his
voice
too
was
constrained
and
harsh
owing
to
the
position
of
his
head
philip
could
not
see
this
play
of
feature
but
he
heard
the
voice
and
thought
that
it
meant
mischief
he
had
but
a
second
to
decide
between
confession
and
the
lie
that
leaped
to
his
lips
an
inward
conviction
told
him
that
his
father
was
not
long
for
this
world
was
it
worth
while
to
face
his
anger
when
matters
might
yet
be
kept
dark
till
the
end
the
tone
of
the
ah
how
he
mistook
its
him
it
was
not
he
thought
possible
that
his
father
could
know
anything
had
he
possessed
a
little
more
knowledge
of
the
world
he
might
have
judged
differently
no
indeed
what
put
that
idea
into
your
head
and
he
laughed
outright
presently
he
became
aware
that
his
father
had
risen
and
was
approaching
towards
him
another
moment
and
a
hand
of
iron
was
laid
upon
his
shoulder
the
awful
eyes
blazed
into
his
face
and
seemed
to
pierce
him
through
and
through
and
a
voice
that
he
could
not
have
recognized
hissed
into
his
unutterable
liar
you
everlasting
hound
your
wife
is
at
this
moment
in
this
philip
sprang
up
with
an
exclamation
of
rage
and
cursed
hilda
aloud
went
on
his
father
standing
before
him
his
tall
frame
swaying
backwards
and
forwards
with
excitement
do
not
curse
her
she
like
your
other
poor
dupe
is
an
honest
woman
on
yourself
be
the
damnation
you
living
fraud
you
outcast
from
all
honour
who
have
brought
shame
and
reproach
upon
our
honest
name
on
you
be
it
may
every
curse
attend
and
may
remorse
torture
listen
you
lied
to
me
you
lied
to
your
wife
trebly
did
you
lie
to
the
unfortunate
girl
you
have
deceived
but
if
you
will
not
speak
it
for
once
hear
the
truth
and
remember
that
you
have
to
deal
with
one
so
relentless
that
fools
mistaking
justice
for
oppression
call
him
i
caresfoot
tell
you
that
i
will
disinherit
you
of
every
stick
stone
and
stiver
that
the
law
allows
me
and
start
you
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
rest
with
my
bitterest
curse
this
i
will
do
now
whilst
i
am
alive
when
i
am
dead
by
heaven
i
will
haunt
you
if
i
here
he
stopped
for
want
of
breath
and
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
full
light
of
the
cheery
blaze
one
hand
raised
above
his
head
as
though
to
strike
and
presenting
with
his
glittering
eyes
and
working
features
so
terrible
a
spectacle
of
rage
that
his
son
recoiled
involuntarily
before
him
but
fury
begets
fury
as
love
begets
love
and
in
another
second
philip
felt
his
own
wicked
temper
boil
up
within
him
he
clenched
his
teeth
and
stood
firm
your
worst
he
said
hate
you
i
wish
to
god
that
you
were
hardly
had
these
dreadful
words
left
his
lips
when
a
change
came
over
the
old
face
it
seemed
to
stiffen
and
putting
one
hand
to
his
heart
he
staggered
back
into
his
chair
pointing
and
making
signs
as
he
fell
towards
a
little
cupboard
in
the
angle
of
the
wall
his
son
at
once
guessed
what
had
happened
his
father
had
got
one
of
the
attacks
of
the
heart
to
which
he
was
subject
and
was
motioning
to
him
to
bring
the
medicine
which
he
had
before
shown
him
and
which
alone
could
save
him
in
these
seizures
actuated
by
a
common
impulse
of
humanity
philip
for
the
moment
forgot
their
quarrel
and
stepped
with
all
speed
to
fetch
it
as
it
happened
there
stood
beneath
this
cupboard
a
table
and
on
this
table
lay
the
document
which
his
father
had
been
reading
that
afternoon
before
the
arrival
of
bellamy
it
was
his
will
and
as
is
usual
in
the
case
of
such
deeds
the
date
was
endorsed
upon
the
back
all
this
philip
saw
at
a
single
glance
and
he
also
saw
that
the
will
was
dated
some
years
back
and
therefore
one
under
which
he
would
inherit
doubtless
the
same
that
his
father
had
some
months
before
offered
to
show
him
it
flashed
through
his
mind
that
his
father
had
got
it
out
in
order
to
burn
it
and
this
idea
was
followed
by
another
that
for
a
moment
stilled
his
heart
he
should
die
now
he
can
not
destroy
it
if
he
does
not
take
the
medicine
he
thought
flies
fast
in
moments
of
emergency
philip
too
was
a
man
of
determined
mind
where
his
own
interests
were
concerned
and
his
blood
was
heated
and
his
reason
blinded
by
fury
and
terror
he
was
not
long
in
settling
on
his
course
of
action
taking
the
bottle
from
the
cupboard
he
poured
out
its
contents
into
one
of
the
that
stood
upon
the
table
and
coming
up
to
his
father
with
it
addressed
him
he
knew
that
these
attacks
although
they
were
of
a
nature
to
cause
intense
pain
did
not
rob
the
sufferer
of
his
senses
the
old
man
though
he
lay
before
him
gasping
with
agony
was
quite
in
a
condition
to
understand
him
to
me
he
said
in
a
slow
distinct
voice
now
you
said
that
you
would
disinherit
me
this
medicine
will
save
your
life
and
if
i
let
it
fall
you
will
die
and
there
is
no
more
in
the
house
swear
before
god
that
you
will
not
carry
out
your
threat
and
i
will
give
it
to
you
lift
up
your
hand
to
show
me
that
you
silence
followed
only
broken
by
the
gasps
of
the
dying
man
you
will
not
swear
i
will
pour
it
out
before
your
again
there
was
silence
but
this
time
the
old
man
made
an
effort
to
rise
and
ring
the
bell
his
son
threw
him
roughly
back
the
last
time
he
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
you
swear
a
struggle
passed
over
his
face
now
nearly
black
with
pain
and
presently
from
the
distended
lips
that
did
not
seem
to
move
there
burst
a
single
to
echo
for
ever
in
his
it
was
his
last
he
sank
back
groaned
and
died
and
at
the
same
moment
the
flame
from
the
flickered
itself
away
and
of
a
sudden
the
room
grew
nearly
dark
philip
stood
for
awhile
aghast
at
his
own
handiwork
and
watched
the
dull
light
glance
on
the
dead
white
of
his
brow
he
was
benumbed
by
terror
at
what
he
had
done
and
in
that
awful
second
of
realization
would
have
given
his
own
life
to
have
it
undone
presently
however
the
instinct
of
came
to
his
aid
he
lit
a
candle
and
taking
some
of
the
medicine
in
the
glass
smeared
it
over
the
dead
chin
and
coat
and
then
broke
the
glass
on
the
floor
by
his
making
it
appear
that
he
had
died
whilst
attempting
to
swallow
the
medicine
next
he
raised
a
loud
outcry
and
violently
rang
the
bell
in
a
minute
the
room
was
full
of
startled
servants
one
of
whom
was
instantly
despatched
for
caley
the
doctor
meanwhile
after
a
vain
attempt
to
restore
animation
the
was
cleared
and
the
corpse
laid
on
it
as
its
had
been
on
that
day
fifty
years
before
then
came
a
dreadful
hush
and
the
shadow
of
death
came
down
upon
the
house
and
brooded
over
it
the
moved
to
and
fro
with
muffled
feet
and
the
women
wept
for
in
a
way
they
had
all
loved
the
imperious
old
man
and
the
last
change
had
come
very
suddenly
brain
burned
he
was
consumed
by
the
desire
of
action
suddenly
he
bethought
him
of
his
wife
upstairs
after
what
he
had
just
passed
through
no
scene
with
her
could
disturb
would
he
even
felt
be
welcome
he
went
up
to
the
room
where
she
was
and
entered
it
was
evident
that
she
had
been
told
of
what
had
happened
as
both
she
and
pigott
who
was
undressing
she
was
wearied
weeping
she
did
not
appear
surprised
at
his
appearance
the
shock
of
the
old
death
extinguished
all
surprise
it
was
he
who
broke
the
silence
is
dead
he
said
i
have
you
are
at
liberty
for
a
few
minutes
i
wish
to
talk
to
you
he
said
savagely
too
she
answered
something
to
say
but
i
am
too
weary
and
upset
to
say
it
now
i
will
see
you
he
turned
and
went
without
answering
and
pigott
noticed
that
no
kiss
or
word
of
endearment
passed
between
them
and
that
the
tone
of
their
words
was
cold
soon
after
philip
got
downstairs
the
doctor
came
philip
met
him
in
the
hall
and
accompanied
him
into
the
study
where
the
body
was
he
made
a
rapid
examination
more
as
a
matter
of
form
than
anything
else
for
his
first
glance
had
told
him
that
life
was
extinct
dead
he
said
sorrowfully
old
friend
gone
at
last
one
of
a
fine
sort
too
a
just
man
for
all
his
temper
they
called
him
and
he
was
fierce
when
he
was
younger
but
if
i
never
meet
a
worse
devil
than
he
was
i
shall
do
well
he
was
very
kind
to
me
very
how
did
he
go
pain
i
were
talking
together
when
suddenly
he
was
seized
with
the
attack
i
got
the
medicine
as
quick
as
i
could
and
tried
to
get
it
down
his
throat
but
he
could
not
swallow
and
in
the
hurry
the
glass
was
knocked
by
a
jerk
of
his
head
right
out
of
my
hands
next
second
he
was
than
i
should
have
expected
did
he
say
anything
now
just
as
philip
delivered
himself
of
this
last
lie
a
curious
incident
happened
or
rather
an
incident
that
is
apt
to
seem
curious
to
a
person
who
has
just
told
a
lie
the
corpse
distinctly
moved
its
right
same
that
had
been
clasped
over
the
old
head
as
he
denounced
his
son
god
said
philip
turning
pale
as
death
that
and
even
the
doctor
started
a
little
and
cast
a
keen
look
at
the
dead
face
he
said
have
seen
that
happen
before
where
there
has
been
considerable
tension
of
the
muscles
before
death
it
is
only
their
final
slackening
that
is
all
come
will
you
ring
the
bell
they
had
better
come
and
take
it
this
sad
task
had
just
been
performed
and
caley
was
about
to
take
his
leave
when
pigott
came
down
and
whispered
something
into
his
ear
that
evidently
caused
him
the
most
lively
astonishment
drawing
philip
aside
he
housekeeper
asks
me
to
come
up
and
see
philip
caresfoot
whom
she
thinks
is
going
to
be
confined
does
she
mean
your
wife
answered
philip
sullenly
does
it
is
a
long
story
and
i
am
too
upset
to
tell
it
you
now
it
will
soon
be
all
over
the
country
i
the
old
doctor
whistled
but
judged
it
advisable
not
to
put
any
more
questions
when
suddenly
an
idea
seemed
to
strike
him
said
you
were
talking
to
your
father
when
the
fit
took
him
was
it
about
your
marriage
did
he
first
know
of
it
i
thank
you
and
he
followed
pigott
upstairs
that
night
exactly
at
twelve
another
little
lamp
floated
out
on
the
waters
of
life
angela
was
born
chapter
xii
when
the
doctor
had
gone
upstairs
philip
went
into
the
to
eat
something
only
to
find
that
food
was
repugnant
to
him
he
could
scarcely
swallow
a
mouthful
to
some
extent
however
he
supplied
its
place
by
wine
of
which
he
drank
several
glasses
then
drawn
by
a
strange
fascination
he
went
back
into
the
little
study
and
remembering
the
will
bethought
himself
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
secure
it
in
taking
it
off
the
table
however
a
folded
and
much
erased
sheet
of
manuscript
was
disclosed
recognizing
writing
he
took
it
up
and
commenced
to
read
the
draft
for
it
was
nothing
else
its
substance
was
as
follows
the
document
began
by
stating
that
the
former
will
was
declared
null
and
void
on
account
of
the
and
dishonourable
conduct
of
his
son
it
then
in
brief
but
sweeping
terms
bequeathed
and
devised
to
trustees
of
whom
philip
was
not
one
the
unentailed
property
and
personalty
to
be
held
by
them
firstly
for
the
benefit
of
any
that
might
be
born
to
the
said
disinherited
philip
by
wife
question
of
daughters
being
probably
by
accident
passed
over
in
failing
such
issue
then
to
the
nephew
george
caresfoot
absolutely
subject
however
to
the
following
curious
condition
should
the
said
george
caresfoot
by
deed
of
gift
or
attempt
to
convey
the
estate
to
his
cousin
philip
or
to
descendants
of
the
said
philip
then
the
gift
over
to
the
said
george
was
to
be
of
none
effect
and
the
whole
was
to
pass
to
some
distant
cousins
of
the
who
lived
in
scotland
then
followed
several
legacies
and
one
charge
on
the
estate
to
the
extent
of
pounds
a
year
payable
to
the
use
of
the
aforesaid
hilda
caresfoot
for
life
and
reverting
at
death
to
the
holder
of
the
estate
in
plain
english
philip
was
under
this
draft
totally
disinherited
first
in
favour
of
his
own
male
issue
by
his
wife
hilda
all
mention
of
daughters
being
omitted
and
failing
such
issue
in
favour
of
his
hated
cousin
george
who
as
though
to
add
insult
to
injury
was
prohibited
from
willing
the
property
back
either
to
himself
or
his
descendants
by
whom
the
testator
had
probably
understood
the
children
of
a
second
marriage
philip
read
the
document
over
twice
carefully
he
said
was
touch
and
go
thank
heavens
he
had
no
time
to
carry
out
his
kind
but
presently
a
terrible
thought
struck
him
he
rang
the
bell
hastily
it
was
answered
by
the
footman
who
since
he
had
an
hour
before
helped
to
carry
his
poor
master
upstairs
had
become
quite
demoralized
it
was
some
time
before
philip
could
get
an
answer
to
his
question
as
to
whether
or
no
any
one
had
been
with
his
father
that
day
whilst
he
was
out
at
last
he
succeeded
in
extracting
a
reply
from
the
man
that
nobody
had
been
except
the
young
he
begged
pardon
caresfoot
as
he
was
told
she
mind
her
said
philip
feeling
as
though
a
load
had
been
taken
from
his
breast
are
sure
nobody
else
has
been
sir
nobody
leastways
he
begged
pardon
nobody
except
lawyer
bellamy
and
his
clerk
who
had
been
there
all
the
afternoon
writing
with
a
black
bag
and
had
sent
for
simmons
to
be
can
go
said
philip
in
a
quiet
voice
he
saw
it
all
now
he
had
let
the
old
man
die
he
had
executed
the
fresh
will
disinheriting
him
he
had
let
him
die
he
had
effectually
and
beyond
redemption
cut
his
own
throat
doubtless
too
bellamy
had
taken
the
new
will
with
him
there
was
no
chance
of
his
being
able
to
destroy
it
by
degrees
however
his
fit
of
brooding
gave
way
to
one
of
sullen
fury
against
his
wife
himself
but
most
of
all
against
his
dead
father
drunk
with
excitement
rage
and
baffled
avarice
he
seized
a
candle
and
staggered
up
to
the
room
where
the
corpse
had
been
laid
launching
imprecations
as
he
went
at
his
dead
head
but
when
he
came
face
to
face
with
that
dread
presence
his
passion
died
and
a
cold
sense
of
the
awful
quiet
and
omnipotence
of
death
came
upon
him
and
chilled
him
into
fear
in
some
indistinct
way
he
realized
how
impotent
is
the
chafing
of
the
waters
of
mortality
against
the
bound
coasts
of
death
to
what
purpose
did
he
rail
against
that
solemn
quiet
thing
that
husk
and
mask
of
life
which
lay
in
unmoved
mockery
of
his
reviling
his
father
was
dead
and
he
even
he
had
killed
his
father
he
was
his
murderer
and
then
a
terror
of
the
reckoning
that
must
one
day
be
struck
between
that
dead
spirit
and
his
own
took
possession
of
him
and
a
foreknowledge
of
the
awful
shadow
under
which
he
must
henceforth
live
crept
into
his
mind
and
froze
the
very
marrow
in
his
bones
he
looked
again
at
the
face
and
to
his
excited
imagination
it
appeared
to
have
assumed
a
sardonic
smile
the
curse
of
cain
fell
upon
him
as
he
looked
and
weighed
him
down
his
hair
rose
and
the
cold
sweat
poured
from
his
forehead
at
length
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
but
turning
fled
out
of
the
room
and
out
of
the
house
far
into
the
night
when
haggard
with
mental
and
bodily
exhaustion
he
at
length
returned
it
was
after
midnight
he
found
caley
waiting
for
him
he
had
just
come
from
the
and
wore
an
anxious
look
upon
his
face
wife
has
been
delivered
of
a
fine
girl
he
said
i
am
bound
to
tell
you
that
her
condition
is
far
from
satisfactory
the
case
is
a
most
complicated
and
dangerous
girl
groaned
philip
mindful
of
the
will
you
sure
that
it
is
a
girl
course
i
am
sure
answered
the
doctor
testily
hilda
here
my
good
fellow
you
are
upset
take
a
glass
of
brandy
and
go
to
bed
your
wife
does
not
wish
to
see
you
now
but
if
necessary
i
will
send
for
you
now
do
as
i
tell
you
or
you
will
be
down
next
your
nerves
are
seriously
philip
did
as
he
was
bid
and
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
him
off
to
his
room
the
doctor
returned
upstairs
in
the
early
morning
he
sent
for
two
of
his
and
they
held
a
consultation
the
upshot
of
which
was
that
they
had
come
to
the
conclusion
nothing
short
of
a
miracle
could
save
a
conclusion
that
she
herself
had
arrived
at
some
hours
before
she
said
trust
to
you
to
let
me
know
when
the
end
is
near
i
wish
my
husband
to
be
present
when
i
die
but
not
my
talk
of
dying
yet
please
god
you
have
many
years
of
life
before
she
shook
her
golden
head
a
little
sadly
doctor
my
sand
has
run
out
and
perhaps
it
as
as
well
give
me
the
do
you
keep
the
child
away
from
me
it
is
the
messenger
sent
to
call
me
to
a
happier
world
yes
she
is
an
angel
messenger
when
i
am
gone
see
that
you
call
her
so
that
i
may
know
by
what
name
to
greet
her
when
the
time
during
the
course
of
the
morning
she
expressed
a
strong
desire
to
see
maria
lee
who
was
accordingly
sent
for
it
will
be
remembered
that
old
caresfoot
had
on
the
previous
day
immediately
after
hilda
had
left
him
sat
down
and
written
to
maria
lee
in
this
note
he
told
her
the
whole
shameful
truth
ending
it
with
a
few
words
of
bitter
humiliation
and
that
such
a
thing
should
have
befallen
her
at
the
hands
of
one
bearing
his
name
over
the
agony
of
shame
and
grief
thus
let
loose
upon
this
unfortunate
girl
we
will
draw
a
veil
it
is
fortunate
for
the
endurance
of
human
reason
that
life
does
not
hold
many
such
hours
as
that
through
which
she
passed
after
the
receipt
of
this
letter
as
was
but
natural
notwithstanding
old
brief
vindication
of
conduct
in
his
letter
maria
was
filled
with
indignation
at
what
to
herself
she
called
her
treachery
and
deceit
while
she
was
yet
full
of
these
thoughts
a
messenger
came
galloping
over
from
bratham
abbey
bringing
a
note
from
caley
that
told
her
of
her
old
sudden
death
and
of
dangerous
condition
and
her
desire
to
see
her
the
receipt
of
this
news
plunged
her
into
a
fresh
access
of
grief
for
she
had
grown
fond
of
the
old
man
nor
had
the
warm
affection
for
hilda
that
had
found
a
place
in
her
gentle
heart
been
altogether
wrenched
away
and
now
that
she
heard
that
her
rival
was
face
to
face
with
that
king
of
terrors
before
whom
all
earthly
love
hate
hope
and
ambition
must
fall
down
and
cease
their
troubling
it
revived
in
all
its
force
nor
did
any
thought
of
her
own
wrongs
come
to
chill
it
within
half
an
hour
she
was
at
the
door
of
the
abbey
house
where
the
doctor
met
her
and
in
answer
to
her
eager
question
told
her
that
humanly
speaking
it
was
impossible
her
friend
could
live
through
another
hours
adding
an
injunction
that
she
must
not
stay
with
her
long
she
entered
the
with
a
heavy
heart
and
there
from
dying
lips
she
heard
the
story
of
her
marriage
and
of
perfidy
their
reconciliation
was
as
complete
as
her
failing
voice
and
strength
would
allow
at
length
she
tore
herself
away
and
turning
at
the
door
took
her
last
look
at
hilda
who
had
raised
herself
upon
her
elbow
and
was
gazing
at
her
retreating
form
with
an
earnestness
that
was
very
touching
the
eyes
maria
felt
were
taking
their
fill
of
what
they
looked
upon
for
the
last
time
in
this
world
catching
her
tearful
gaze
the
dying
woman
smiled
and
lifting
her
hand
pointed
upwards
thus
they
parted
but
maria
could
control
herself
no
longer
her
own
blasted
prospects
the
loss
of
the
man
she
loved
and
the
affecting
scene
through
which
she
had
just
passed
all
helped
to
break
her
down
running
downstairs
into
the
she
threw
herself
on
a
sofa
and
gave
full
passage
to
her
grief
presently
she
became
aware
that
she
was
not
alone
philip
stood
before
her
or
rather
the
wreck
of
him
whom
she
knew
as
philip
indeed
it
was
hard
to
recognize
in
this
scared
man
with
dishevelled
hair
white
and
trembling
lips
and
eyes
ringed
round
with
black
the
bold
handsome
youth
whom
she
had
loved
the
sight
of
him
stayed
her
sorrow
and
a
sense
of
her
bitter
injuries
rushed
in
upon
her
do
you
want
with
me
she
asked
i
want
forgiveness
i
am
crushed
maria
crushed
and
he
put
his
hands
to
his
face
and
sobbed
she
answered
him
with
the
quiet
dignity
that
good
women
can
command
in
moments
of
of
a
very
different
stamp
from
haughty
pride
but
perhaps
as
impressive
in
its
way
ask
forgiveness
of
me
and
say
that
you
are
crushed
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
without
fault
of
my
own
except
the
fault
of
trusting
you
as
entirely
as
i
loved
you
i
too
am
crushed
do
you
know
that
you
have
wantonly
or
to
gain
selfish
ends
broken
my
heart
blighted
my
name
and
driven
me
from
my
home
for
i
can
live
here
no
more
do
you
understand
that
you
have
done
me
one
of
the
greatest
injuries
one
person
can
do
to
another
i
say
do
you
know
all
this
philip
caresfoot
and
knowing
it
do
you
still
ask
me
to
forgive
you
do
you
think
it
possible
that
i
forgive
he
had
never
heard
her
speak
like
this
before
and
did
not
remember
that
intense
feeling
is
the
mother
of
eloquence
he
gazed
at
her
for
a
moment
in
astonishment
then
he
dropped
his
face
into
his
hands
again
and
groaned
making
no
other
answer
after
waiting
awhile
she
went
am
an
insignificant
creature
i
know
and
perhaps
the
mite
of
my
happiness
or
misery
makes
little
difference
in
the
scale
of
things
but
to
me
the
gift
of
all
my
love
was
everything
i
gave
it
to
you
it
without
a
doubt
or
murmur
gave
it
with
both
hands
i
can
never
have
it
back
to
give
again
how
you
have
treated
it
you
best
here
she
broke
down
a
little
and
then
continued
may
seem
curious
but
though
my
love
has
been
so
mistakenly
given
though
you
to
whom
it
was
given
have
dealt
so
ill
with
it
yet
i
am
anxious
that
on
my
side
there
should
be
no
bitter
memory
that
in
looking
back
at
all
this
in
after
years
you
should
never
be
able
to
dwell
upon
any
harsh
or
unkind
word
of
mine
it
is
on
that
account
and
also
because
i
feel
that
it
is
not
for
me
to
judge
you
and
that
you
have
already
much
to
bear
that
i
do
as
you
ask
me
and
say
from
my
heart
i
forgive
you
as
i
trust
that
the
almighty
may
forgive
he
flung
himself
upon
his
knees
before
her
and
tried
to
take
her
hand
do
not
know
how
you
have
humbled
me
he
groaned
she
gazed
at
him
with
pity
am
sorry
she
said
did
not
wish
to
humble
you
i
have
one
word
more
to
say
and
then
i
must
go
i
have
just
bid
my
last
earthly
farewell
wife
my
farewell
to
you
must
be
as
complete
as
that
as
complete
as
though
the
grave
had
already
swallowed
one
of
us
we
have
done
with
each
other
for
ever
i
do
not
think
that
i
shall
come
back
here
in
my
waking
moments
your
name
shall
never
willingly
pass
my
lips
again
i
will
say
it
for
the
last
time
now
philip
whom
i
chose
to
love
out
of
all
the
world
i
pray
god
that
he
will
take
me
or
deaden
the
edge
of
what
i
suffer
and
that
he
may
never
let
my
feet
cross
your
path
or
my
eyes
fall
upon
your
face
in
another
second
she
had
passed
out
of
the
room
and
out
of
his
life
that
night
or
rather
just
before
dawn
on
the
following
morning
hilda
knowing
that
her
end
was
very
near
sent
for
her
husband
quickly
doctor
she
said
shall
die
at
the
doctor
found
him
seated
in
the
same
spot
where
maria
lee
had
left
him
more
misery
he
said
when
he
had
told
his
errand
can
not
bear
it
there
is
a
curse
upon
and
wickedness
misery
and
death
must
come
if
you
wish
to
see
your
wife
will
come
and
he
rose
and
followed
him
a
sad
sight
awaited
him
the
moment
of
the
grey
dawn
was
drawing
near
and
by
his
request
a
window
had
been
unshuttered
that
her
dimmed
eyes
might
once
more
look
upon
the
light
on
the
great
bed
in
the
centre
of
the
room
lay
hilda
whose
life
was
now
quickly
draining
from
her
and
by
her
side
was
placed
the
sleeping
infant
she
was
raised
and
supported
on
either
side
by
pillows
and
her
unbound
golden
hair
fell
around
her
shoulders
enclosing
her
face
as
in
a
frame
her
pallid
countenance
seemed
touched
with
an
awful
beauty
that
had
not
belonged
to
it
in
life
whilst
in
her
eyes
was
that
dread
and
prescient
gaze
which
sometimes
come
to
those
who
are
about
to
solve
mystery
by
the
side
of
the
bed
knelt
fraser
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
repeating
in
an
earnest
tone
the
prayers
for
the
dying
whilst
the
attendants
moved
with
muffled
tread
backwards
and
forwards
from
the
ring
of
light
around
the
bed
into
the
dark
shadows
that
lay
beyond
when
philip
came
the
clergyman
ceased
praying
and
drew
back
into
the
further
part
of
the
room
as
did
pigott
and
the
nurse
the
former
taking
the
baby
with
her
hilda
motioned
to
him
to
come
close
to
her
he
came
and
bent
over
and
kissed
her
and
she
with
an
effort
threw
one
ivory
arm
around
his
neck
and
smiled
sweetly
after
about
a
minute
during
which
she
was
apparently
collecting
her
thoughts
she
spoke
in
a
low
voice
and
in
her
native
tongue
have
not
sent
for
you
before
philip
for
two
because
i
wished
to
spare
you
pain
and
next
in
order
that
i
might
have
time
to
rid
my
mind
of
angry
thoughts
against
you
they
are
all
gone
with
every
other
earthly
interest
but
i
angry
with
you
philip
and
now
listen
to
i
have
not
much
do
not
forget
my
words
in
future
years
when
the
story
of
my
life
will
seem
but
as
a
shadow
that
once
fell
upon
your
path
change
your
ways
philip
dear
abandon
deceit
atone
for
the
past
if
you
can
make
your
peace
with
maria
lee
and
marry
it
is
a
pity
that
you
did
not
do
that
at
first
and
leave
me
to
go
my
above
all
humble
your
heart
before
the
power
that
i
am
about
to
face
i
love
you
dear
and
notwithstanding
all
i
am
thankful
to
have
been
your
wife
please
god
we
shall
meet
she
paused
awhile
and
then
spoke
in
english
to
the
astonishment
of
all
her
voice
was
strong
and
clear
and
she
uttered
her
words
with
an
energy
that
under
the
circumstances
seemed
almost
awful
her
to
bring
the
there
was
no
need
for
philip
to
repeat
what
she
said
for
pigott
heard
her
and
at
once
came
forward
with
the
baby
which
she
laid
beside
her
the
dying
woman
placed
her
hand
upon
its
tiny
head
and
turning
her
eyes
upwards
with
the
rapt
expression
of
one
who
sees
a
vision
the
power
of
god
be
about
you
to
protect
you
my
motherless
babe
may
angels
guard
you
and
make
you
as
they
are
and
may
the
heavy
curse
and
everlasting
doom
of
the
almighty
fall
upon
those
who
would
bring
evil
upon
she
paused
and
then
addressed
her
husband
you
have
heard
my
words
in
your
charge
i
leave
the
child
see
that
you
never
betray
my
then
turning
to
pigott
she
said
in
a
fainter
you
for
your
kindness
to
me
you
have
a
good
face
if
you
can
stop
with
my
child
and
give
her
your
love
and
care
and
now
may
god
have
mercy
on
my
soul
then
came
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
stifled
sobs
of
those
who
stood
around
till
a
ray
of
light
from
the
rising
sun
struggled
through
the
grey
mist
of
the
morning
and
touching
the
heads
of
mother
and
child
illumined
them
as
with
a
glory
it
passed
as
quickly
as
it
came
drawing
away
with
it
the
life
suddenly
as
it
faded
she
spread
out
her
arms
sighed
and
smiled
when
the
doctor
reached
the
bed
her
story
was
told
she
had
fallen
asleep
death
had
been
very
gentle
with
her
chapter
xiii
go
my
reader
if
the
day
is
dull
and
you
feel
inclined
to
for
whatever
may
be
said
to
the
contrary
there
are
less
useful
look
at
your
village
churchyard
what
do
you
see
before
you
a
plot
of
enclosed
ground
backed
by
a
grey
old
church
a
number
of
tombstones
more
or
less
decrepit
and
a
great
quantity
of
little
oblong
mounds
covered
with
rank
grass
if
you
have
any
imagination
any
power
of
thought
you
will
see
more
than
that
first
with
the
instinctive
selfishness
of
human
nature
you
will
recognize
your
own
future
habitation
perhaps
your
eye
will
mark
the
identical
spot
where
the
body
you
love
must
lie
through
all
seasons
and
weathers
through
the
slow
centuries
that
will
flit
so
fast
for
you
till
the
crash
of
doom
it
is
good
that
you
should
think
of
that
although
it
makes
you
shudder
the
english
churchyard
takes
the
place
of
the
egyptian
mummy
at
the
feast
or
the
slave
in
the
roman
mocks
your
vigour
and
whispers
of
the
end
of
beauty
and
strength
probably
you
need
some
such
reminder
but
if
giving
to
the
inevitable
the
sigh
that
is
its
due
you
pursue
the
vein
of
thought
it
may
further
occur
to
you
that
the
plot
before
you
is
in
a
sense
a
summary
of
the
aspirations
of
humanity
it
marks
the
realization
of
human
hopes
it
is
the
crown
of
human
ambitions
the
grave
of
human
failures
here
too
is
the
end
of
the
man
and
here
the
birthplace
of
the
angel
or
the
demon
it
is
his
sure
inheritance
one
that
he
never
solicits
and
never
squanders
and
last
it
is
the
only
certain
of
sleepless
tired
mortality
here
it
was
that
they
brought
hilda
and
the
old
squire
and
laid
them
side
by
side
against
the
coffin
of
yeoman
caresfoot
whose
fancy
it
had
been
to
be
buried
in
stone
and
then
piling
primroses
and
blackthorn
blooms
upon
their
graves
left
them
to
their
chilly
sleep
farewell
to
them
they
have
passed
to
where
as
yet
we
may
not
follow
violent
old
man
and
proud
and
lovely
woman
rest
in
peace
if
peace
be
the
portion
of
you
both
to
return
to
the
living
the
news
of
the
sudden
decease
of
old
caresfoot
of
the
discovery
of
secret
marriage
and
the
death
of
his
wife
of
the
terms
of
the
old
will
under
which
hilda
being
dead
and
having
only
left
a
daughter
behind
her
george
inherited
all
the
unentailed
portion
of
the
property
with
the
curious
provision
that
he
was
never
to
leave
it
back
to
philip
or
his
children
of
the
sudden
departure
of
miss
lee
and
of
many
other
things
that
were
some
of
them
true
and
some
of
them
false
following
as
they
did
upon
the
heels
of
the
great
and
the
announcement
made
thereat
threw
the
into
a
state
of
indescribable
ferment
when
this
settled
down
it
left
a
strong
and
permanent
residuum
of
public
indignation
and
contempt
directed
against
philip
the
more
cordially
perhaps
because
he
was
no
longer
a
rich
man
people
very
rarely
express
contempt
or
indignation
against
a
rich
man
who
happens
to
be
their
neighbour
in
the
country
whatever
he
may
have
done
they
keep
their
virtue
for
those
who
are
impoverished
or
for
their
unfortunate
relations
but
for
philip
it
was
felt
that
there
was
no
excuse
and
no
forgiveness
he
had
lost
both
his
character
and
his
money
and
must
therefore
be
cut
and
from
that
day
forward
he
was
cut
accordingly
as
for
philip
himself
he
was
fortunately
as
yet
ignorant
of
the
kind
intentions
of
his
friends
and
neighbours
who
had
been
so
fond
of
him
a
week
ago
he
had
enough
upon
his
shoulders
without
he
had
spoken
no
lie
when
he
told
maria
lee
that
he
was
crushed
by
the
dreadful
and
repeated
blows
that
had
fallen
upon
him
blows
that
had
robbed
him
of
everything
that
made
life
worth
living
and
given
him
in
return
nothing
but
an
infant
who
could
not
inherit
and
who
was
therefore
only
an
incumbrance
who
is
it
that
says
all
let
a
bad
man
take
what
pains
he
may
to
push
it
down
a
human
soul
is
an
awful
ghostly
unique
possession
for
a
bad
man
to
have
during
the
time
that
had
elapsed
between
the
death
and
burial
of
his
father
and
wife
philip
had
become
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
truth
of
this
remark
do
what
he
would
he
could
never
for
a
single
hour
shake
himself
free
from
the
recollection
of
his
death
whenever
he
shut
his
eyes
his
uneasy
mind
continually
conjured
up
the
whole
scene
with
uncanny
distinctness
the
gloomy
room
the
contorted
face
of
the
dying
man
the
red
flicker
of
the
firelight
on
the
these
things
were
burnt
deep
into
the
tablets
of
his
memory
more
and
more
did
he
recognize
the
fact
that
even
should
he
live
long
enough
to
bury
the
events
of
that
hour
beneath
the
debris
of
many
years
the
lapse
of
time
would
be
insufficient
to
bring
forgetfulness
and
the
recognition
brought
with
it
moral
helplessness
he
had
too
sufficient
religious
feeling
to
make
him
uneasy
as
to
his
future
fate
and
possessed
a
certain
amount
of
imagination
which
was
at
this
time
all
directed
towards
that
awful
day
when
he
and
his
dead
father
must
settle
their
final
accounts
already
in
the
quiet
nights
he
would
wake
with
a
start
thinking
that
the
inevitable
time
had
come
superstitious
fears
also
would
seize
him
with
their
clammy
fingers
and
he
would
shake
and
tremble
at
the
fancied
step
of
ghostly
feet
and
his
blood
would
curdle
in
his
veins
as
his
mind
hearkened
to
voices
that
were
for
ever
still
and
worst
of
all
what
had
been
done
and
could
never
be
undone
had
been
done
in
vain
these
deadly
torments
must
be
endured
whilst
the
object
for
which
they
had
been
incurred
had
utterly
escaped
him
he
had
sold
himself
to
the
powers
of
evil
for
a
price
and
that
price
had
not
been
paid
but
the
bond
was
good
for
all
that
and
so
he
would
brood
hour
after
hour
till
he
felt
himself
drawing
near
to
madness
sometimes
by
a
strong
effort
he
would
succeed
in
tearing
his
mind
away
from
the
subject
but
then
its
place
was
instantly
filled
by
a
proud
form
with
reproachful
eyes
and
he
would
feel
that
there
too
death
had
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
make
atonement
of
those
whom
he
had
wronged
maria
lee
alone
survived
and
she
had
left
him
in
sorrow
more
bitter
than
any
anger
truly
philip
caresfoot
was
in
melancholy
case
somewhere
he
had
read
that
the
wages
of
sin
is
death
but
surely
what
he
felt
surpassed
the
bitterness
of
death
his
had
not
prospered
with
him
the
snare
he
had
set
for
his
father
had
fallen
back
upon
himself
and
he
was
a
crushed
and
ruined
man
it
affords
a
curious
insight
into
his
character
to
reflect
that
all
these
calamities
all
this
wreck
and
sudden
death
did
not
bring
him
penitent
on
his
knees
before
the
maker
he
had
outraged
the
crimes
he
had
committed
especially
if
unsuccessful
or
the
sorrows
that
had
fallen
upon
him
would
have
sufficed
to
reduce
of
ordinary
men
to
a
condition
of
humble
supplication
for
generally
speaking
irreligion
or
rather
forgetfulness
of
god
is
a
plant
of
no
deep
growth
in
the
human
heart
since
its
roots
are
turned
by
the
rock
of
that
innate
knowledge
of
a
higher
power
that
forms
the
foundation
of
every
soul
and
on
which
we
are
glad
enough
to
set
our
feet
when
the
storms
of
trouble
and
emergency
threaten
to
destroy
us
but
with
philip
this
was
not
so
he
never
thought
of
repentance
his
was
not
the
nature
to
fall
down
and
say
i
have
sinned
take
thou
my
burden
from
indeed
he
was
not
so
much
sorry
for
the
past
as
fearful
for
the
future
it
was
not
grief
for
that
wrung
his
heart
and
broke
his
spirit
but
rather
his
natural
sorrow
at
losing
the
only
creature
he
had
ever
deeply
loved
chagrin
at
the
shame
of
his
position
and
the
failure
of
his
hopes
and
the
icy
fingers
of
superstitious
fears
the
crisis
had
come
and
passed
he
had
sinned
against
his
father
in
heaven
and
his
father
on
earth
and
he
did
not
sorrow
for
his
sin
his
wife
had
left
him
murmuring
with
her
dying
lips
exhortations
to
repentance
and
he
did
not
soften
shame
and
loss
had
fallen
upon
him
and
he
did
not
turn
to
god
but
his
pride
was
broken
all
that
remained
to
him
of
strength
was
his
wickedness
the
flood
that
had
swept
over
him
had
purged
away
not
the
evil
but
the
good
from
the
evil
it
only
took
its
courage
henceforth
if
he
sins
at
all
his
will
be
no
bold
and
hazardous
villany
which
whilst
it
excites
horror
can
almost
compel
respect
but
rather
the
low
and
sordid
crime
the
safe
and
treacherous
iniquity
ajax
no
longer
defies
the
mutters
curses
on
it
beneath
his
breath
on
the
evening
of
the
double
philip
did
not
feel
equal
to
attending
and
at
which
george
in
a
most
egregious
hatband
and
with
many
sobs
and
tears
officiated
as
chief
fraser
thought
it
would
be
a
kind
act
on
his
part
to
go
and
offer
such
consolation
to
the
bereaved
man
as
lay
within
his
power
if
indeed
he
would
accept
it
somewhat
contrary
to
his
expectation
he
was
on
arrival
at
the
abbey
house
asked
in
without
delay
am
glad
to
see
a
human
face
said
philip
to
the
clergyman
as
he
entered
the
room
loneliness
is
intolerable
i
am
as
much
alone
as
though
i
lay
stark
in
the
churchyard
like
my
poor
fraser
did
not
answer
him
immediately
so
taken
up
was
he
in
noticing
the
wonderful
changes
a
week
had
wrought
in
his
appearance
not
only
did
his
countenance
bear
traces
of
the
illness
and
exhaustion
that
might
not
unnaturally
be
expected
in
such
a
case
of
bereavement
but
it
faithfully
reflected
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
his
mental
attitude
his
eyes
had
lost
the
frank
boldness
that
had
made
them
very
pleasing
to
some
people
they
looked
scared
the
mouth
too
was
rendered
conspicuous
by
the
absence
of
the
firm
lines
that
once
gave
it
character
indeed
the
whole
appearance
was
pitiful
and
almost
abject
am
afraid
he
said
at
length
in
a
tone
of
gentle
compassion
you
must
have
suffered
a
great
deal
i
have
suffered
the
tortures
of
the
damned
i
still
suffer
them
i
shall
always
suffer
do
not
wish
said
the
clergyman
with
a
little
hesitation
appear
officious
or
to
make
a
mockery
of
your
grief
by
telling
you
that
it
is
for
your
good
but
i
should
fail
in
my
duty
if
i
did
not
point
out
to
you
that
he
who
strikes
the
blow
has
the
power
to
heal
the
wound
and
that
very
often
such
things
are
for
our
ultimate
benefit
either
in
this
world
or
the
next
carry
your
troubles
to
him
my
dear
fellow
acknowledge
his
hand
and
if
you
know
in
your
heart
of
any
way
in
which
you
have
sinned
offer
him
your
hearty
repentance
do
this
and
you
will
not
be
deserted
your
life
that
now
seems
to
you
nothing
but
ashes
may
yet
be
both
a
happy
and
a
useful
philip
smiled
bitterly
as
he
talk
to
me
of
can
i
repent
when
providence
has
treated
me
so
cruelly
robbing
me
at
a
single
blow
of
my
wife
and
my
fortune
i
know
that
i
did
wrong
in
concealing
my
marriage
but
i
was
driven
to
it
by
fear
of
my
father
ah
if
you
had
seen
him
as
i
saw
him
you
would
have
known
that
they
were
right
to
call
him
he
checked
himself
and
then
went
forced
me
into
the
engagement
with
miss
lee
and
announced
it
without
my
consent
now
i
am
is
taken
from
have
your
little
daughter
and
all
the
entailed
least
so
i
am
little
daughter
never
want
to
see
her
face
she
killed
her
mother
if
it
had
been
a
boy
it
would
have
been
different
for
then
at
any
rate
that
accursed
george
would
not
have
got
my
birthright
my
little
daughter
indeed
enumerate
her
among
my
earthly
is
rather
sad
to
hear
you
talk
like
that
of
your
child
but
at
any
rate
you
are
not
left
in
want
you
have
one
of
the
finest
old
places
in
the
county
and
a
thousand
a
year
which
to
most
men
would
be
which
to
me
answered
philip
beggary
i
should
have
had
six
and
i
have
got
one
but
look
you
here
fraser
i
swear
before
i
can
not
listen
to
such
then
before
anything
you
like
that
while
i
live
i
will
never
rest
one
single
moment
until
i
get
my
own
back
again
it
may
seem
impossible
but
i
will
find
a
way
for
instance
he
added
as
a
thought
struck
him
enough
the
will
does
not
forbid
me
to
buy
the
lands
back
if
i
can
get
them
no
other
way
i
will
buy
do
you
hear
will
buy
them
i
have
them
again
before
i
will
you
get
the
money
will
save
it
make
it
steal
it
get
it
somehow
oh
do
not
be
afraid
i
will
get
the
money
it
will
take
a
few
years
but
i
will
get
it
somehow
it
is
not
the
want
of
a
few
thousands
that
will
stop
a
determined
suppose
your
cousin
sell
will
find
a
way
to
make
him
bribe
something
there
there
and
his
enthusiasm
and
eagerness
vanished
in
a
moment
and
the
broken
look
came
back
upon
his
face
all
nonsense
i
am
talking
little
weak
in
my
mind
i
suppose
forget
it
a
good
fellow
say
nothing
about
it
and
so
you
buried
them
ah
me
ah
me
and
george
did
chief
mourner
i
suppose
he
blubbered
freely
he
always
could
blubber
freely
when
he
liked
i
remember
how
he
used
to
take
folks
in
as
a
lad
and
then
laugh
at
them
why
they
called
him
at
school
well
my
master
now
and
his
very
humble
servant
perhaps
one
day
it
will
be
the
other
way
up
again
what
must
you
go
if
you
knew
how
fearfully
lonely
i
am
you
would
not
go
my
nerves
have
quite
gone
and
i
fancy
all
sorts
of
things
i
can
think
of
nothing
but
those
two
graves
out
there
in
the
dark
have
they
sodded
them
over
tell
them
to
sod
them
over
it
was
kind
of
you
to
come
and
see
me
you
pay
any
attention
to
my
talk
i
am
not
quite
myself
good
fraser
was
an
extremely
unsuspicious
man
but
somehow
as
he
picked
his
way
to
the
vicarage
to
eat
his
solitary
chop
he
felt
a
doubt
rising
in
his
mind
as
to
whether
his
disclaimer
notwithstanding
philip
had
not
sincerely
meant
all
he
said
is
shockingly
changed
he
mused
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
a
change
for
the
better
poor
fellow
he
has
a
great
deal
to
bear
and
should
be
kindly
judged
it
is
all
so
painful
that
i
must
try
to
divert
my
mind
brown
will
you
bring
me
a
little
coloured
book
that
you
will
see
on
the
table
in
my
study
when
you
come
back
with
the
potatoes
it
has
on
the
chapter
xiv
the
jubilation
of
george
at
the
turn
events
had
taken
may
perhaps
be
more
easily
imagined
than
described
there
is
generally
one
weak
point
about
all
artful
schemes
to
keep
other
people
out
of
their
rights
they
break
down
over
some
unforeseen
detail
or
through
the
neglect
of
some
trivial
and
obvious
precaution
but
this
was
one
of
the
glorious
instances
to
the
contrary
that
prove
the
rule
nothing
had
broken
down
everything
had
prospered
as
a
holy
cause
always
should
and
does
theory
the
stars
in
their
courses
had
fought
for
sisera
everything
had
succeeded
beyond
expectation
nothing
had
failed
in
the
gratitude
of
his
heart
george
would
willingly
have
given
a
thousand
pounds
towards
the
establishment
of
a
for
anonymous
or
the
erection
of
a
statue
to
hilda
caresfoot
whose
outraged
pride
and
womanly
jealousy
had
done
him
such
yeoman
service
speaking
seriously
he
had
great
cause
for
rejoicing
instead
of
a
comparatively
slender
younger
portion
he
had
stepped
into
a
fine
and
unencumbered
property
of
over
five
thousand
a
year
and
that
in
the
heyday
of
his
youth
when
in
the
full
possession
of
all
his
capacities
for
enjoyment
which
were
large
indeed
henceforth
everything
that
money
could
buy
would
be
his
including
the
respect
and
flattery
of
his
poorer
neighbours
an
added
flavour
too
was
given
to
the
overflowing
cup
of
his
good
fortune
by
the
fact
that
it
had
been
wrenched
from
the
hands
of
the
cousin
whom
he
hated
and
on
whom
he
had
from
a
boy
sworn
to
be
avenged
poor
philip
bankrupt
in
honour
and
broken
in
fortune
he
could
afford
to
pity
him
now
to
pity
him
ostentatiously
and
in
public
he
was
with
his
pity
was
george
nor
did
he
lack
a
sympathizer
in
these
delicious
moments
of
unexpected
triumph
i
not
tell
you
said
bellamy
in
her
full
rich
tones
on
the
afternoon
of
the
reading
of
the
i
not
tell
you
that
if
you
would
consent
to
be
guided
by
me
i
would
pull
you
through
and
have
i
not
pulled
you
through
never
misdoubt
my
judgment
again
my
dear
george
it
is
infinitely
sounder
than
your
did
anne
you
certainly
did
you
are
a
charming
woman
and
as
clever
as
you
are
are
all
very
well
and
i
am
sure
i
appreciate
she
gave
a
little
their
proper
value
but
i
must
remind
you
george
that
i
have
done
my
part
of
the
bargain
and
that
now
you
must
do
all
right
bellamy
shall
have
the
agency
and
two
hundred
a
year
with
it
and
to
show
you
that
i
have
not
forgotten
you
perhaps
you
will
accept
this
in
memorial
of
our
joint
achievement
and
he
drew
from
his
pocket
and
opened
a
case
containing
a
superb
set
of
sapphires
bellamy
had
all
a
beautiful
love
for
jewels
and
especially
adored
sapphires
she
said
clasping
her
hands
you
george
they
are
perfectly
lovely
he
replied
politely
not
half
so
lovely
as
their
wearer
i
wonder
he
added
with
a
little
laugh
the
old
boy
would
say
if
he
could
know
that
a
thousand
pounds
of
his
personalty
had
gone
by
anticipation
to
buy
a
necklace
for
anne
to
this
remark
she
made
no
reply
being
apparently
absorbed
in
her
own
thoughts
at
last
she
spoke
want
to
seem
ungracious
george
but
she
touched
the
not
the
reward
i
expected
i
want
the
letters
you
promised
me
dear
anne
you
are
under
a
mistake
i
never
promised
you
the
letters
i
said
that
under
the
circumstances
i
might
possibly
restore
very
different
thing
from
bellamy
flushed
a
little
and
the
great
pupils
of
her
sleepy
eyes
contracted
till
she
looked
quite
dangerous
i
must
have
strangely
misunderstood
you
she
said
do
you
want
the
letters
for
you
trust
me
with
them
you
think
george
that
if
you
had
passed
through
something
very
terrible
you
would
like
to
have
all
the
mementoes
of
that
dark
time
destroyed
those
letters
are
the
record
of
my
terrible
time
nothing
remains
of
it
but
those
written
lines
i
want
to
burn
them
to
stamp
them
into
powder
to
obliterate
them
as
i
have
obliterated
all
the
past
whilst
they
exist
i
can
never
feel
safe
supposing
you
were
to
turn
traitor
to
me
and
let
those
letters
fall
into
the
hands
of
others
supposing
that
you
lost
them
i
should
be
a
ruined
woman
i
speak
frankly
you
see
i
fully
appreciate
my
danger
principally
because
i
know
that
the
more
intimate
a
man
and
woman
have
been
the
more
chance
there
is
of
their
becoming
bitter
enemies
george
give
me
those
letters
do
not
overcloud
my
future
with
the
shadows
of
the
talk
as
well
as
you
do
everything
else
anne
you
are
really
a
very
remarkable
woman
but
curiously
enough
those
letters
the
existence
of
which
is
so
obnoxious
to
you
are
to
me
a
source
of
great
interest
you
know
that
i
love
to
study
occupation
for
a
young
man
it
i
do
well
in
my
small
experience
i
have
never
yet
either
in
fiction
or
in
real
life
come
across
such
a
fascinating
display
as
is
reflected
in
those
letters
there
i
can
and
often
do
trace
in
minutest
detail
the
agony
of
a
strong
mind
can
see
the
barriers
of
what
people
call
religion
early
training
respect
and
other
curiosities
which
we
name
virtues
bursting
away
one
by
one
under
pressure
like
the
bulkheads
they
put
in
passenger
steamers
till
at
length
the
work
is
done
the
moral
ship
sinks
and
the
writer
stands
revealed
what
you
are
my
dear
anne
the
loveliest
the
cleverest
and
the
most
utterly
unscrupulous
woman
in
the
three
she
rose
very
quietly
but
quite
white
with
passion
and
answered
in
her
low
i
am
you
made
me
and
are
a
devil
george
caresfoot
or
you
could
not
take
pleasure
in
the
tortures
you
inflicted
before
you
destroyed
but
go
too
far
or
you
may
regret
it
am
i
a
woman
to
be
played
with
i
think
that
you
have
trained
me
too
he
laughed
a
little
uneasily
you
see
le
and
out
comes
the
true
character
look
at
your
face
in
the
glass
it
is
magnificent
but
not
pleasant
rather
dangerous
indeed
why
anne
do
be
reasonable
if
i
gave
you
those
letters
i
should
never
be
able
to
sleep
in
peace
for
the
sake
of
my
own
safety
i
dare
not
abandon
the
i
have
of
you
remember
you
could
if
you
chose
say
some
unpleasant
things
about
me
and
i
want
that
any
more
than
you
do
just
now
but
you
see
whilst
i
hold
in
my
power
what
would
if
necessary
effectually
ruin
you
and
probably
bellamy
this
country
society
is
absurdly
have
little
cause
for
fear
perhaps
in
the
future
you
may
be
able
to
render
me
some
service
for
which
you
shall
have
the
knows
you
see
i
am
perfectly
frank
with
you
for
the
simple
reason
that
i
know
that
it
is
useless
to
try
to
conceal
my
thoughts
from
a
person
of
your
well
perhaps
you
are
right
it
is
difficult
to
trust
oneself
much
less
any
one
else
at
any
rate
she
said
with
a
bitter
smile
have
given
me
bellamy
a
start
in
society
and
a
sapphire
necklace
in
twenty
years
i
hope
if
the
fates
are
kind
to
have
lost
bellamy
on
the
is
really
rule
society
and
to
have
as
many
sapphire
necklaces
and
other
fine
things
as
i
care
for
in
enumerating
my
qualities
you
omitted
one
your
looks
your
determination
and
your
brains
there
is
nothing
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
do
if
you
set
your
mind
to
it
and
make
an
enemy
of
your
devoted
and
thus
the
conversation
ended
now
little
bellamy
had
after
much
anxious
thought
just
about
this
time
come
to
a
bold
to
asset
his
marital
authority
over
bellamy
indeed
his
was
much
injured
by
the
treatment
he
received
at
his
hands
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
utterly
ignored
in
his
own
house
in
fact
it
would
not
be
too
much
to
say
that
he
an
entire
nonentity
he
had
married
bellamy
for
love
or
rather
from
fascination
though
she
had
nothing
in
the
her
in
a
fortnight
from
the
time
that
george
had
first
introduced
him
when
he
had
walked
out
of
church
with
his
beautiful
bride
he
had
thought
himself
the
luckiest
man
in
london
whereas
now
he
could
not
but
feel
that
matrimony
had
not
fulfilled
his
expectations
in
the
first
place
young
was
barely
to
a
rude
awakening
for
once
married
it
was
impossible
he
had
in
common
with
the
majority
of
little
men
a
tolerably
good
opinion
of
that
he
should
perceive
that
his
wife
did
not
care
one
brass
farthing
about
him
to
his
soft
advances
she
was
as
cold
as
a
marble
statue
the
lovely
eyes
never
grew
tender
for
him
indeed
he
found
that
she
was
worse
than
a
statue
for
statues
can
not
indulge
in
bitter
mockery
and
contemptuous
comments
and
bellamy
could
and
what
is
more
frequently
did
is
very
well
reflected
her
husband
marry
the
loveliest
woman
in
the
county
but
i
see
the
use
of
it
if
she
treats
one
like
a
at
last
this
state
of
affairs
had
grown
intolerable
and
meditating
in
the
solitude
of
his
office
bellamy
resolved
to
assert
himself
once
and
for
all
and
set
matters
on
a
proper
footing
and
bellamy
in
her
place
but
it
is
one
thing
for
husbands
of
the
bellamy
stamp
to
form
resolutions
and
another
for
them
to
put
those
resolutions
into
active
and
visible
operation
on
wives
of
the
bellamy
stamp
indeed
had
it
not
been
for
a
little
incident
about
to
be
detailed
it
is
doubtful
if
bellamy
would
have
ever
come
to
the
scratch
at
all
when
george
had
gone
bellamy
sat
down
in
by
no
means
the
sweetest
of
tempers
to
think
but
thinking
in
this
instance
proved
an
unprofitable
occupation
and
she
gave
it
up
in
order
to
admire
the
sapphire
necklace
that
lay
upon
her
knee
at
that
moment
her
husband
entered
the
room
but
she
took
no
notice
merely
going
on
examining
the
stones
after
moving
about
a
little
as
though
to
attract
attention
the
gentleman
spoke
have
managed
to
get
home
to
lunch
my
you
might
take
a
little
notice
of
is
there
anything
remarkable
about
you
this
morning
there
is
not
but
remarkable
or
not
a
man
who
has
been
fool
bellamy
laid
great
emphasis
on
the
word
get
married
has
a
right
to
expect
when
he
comes
into
his
own
house
that
he
will
have
a
little
notice
taken
of
him
and
not
be
as
completely
overlooked
though
he
were
a
tub
of
butter
in
a
shop
and
he
pugged
out
his
chest
rubbed
his
hands
and
looked
defiant
the
lady
laid
her
head
back
on
the
chair
and
laughed
with
exquisite
enjoyment
my
dear
john
you
will
kill
me
she
said
at
length
i
ask
he
replied
looking
as
though
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
that
he
would
like
better
you
are
laughing
at
slightly
vulgar
but
happy
simile
it
is
easy
to
see
where
you
draw
your
inspiration
from
if
you
had
only
said
butterine
inferior
butter
you
know
the
counterfeit
article
it
would
have
been
her
husband
gave
a
glance
at
his
tubby
little
figure
in
the
glass
i
to
understand
that
you
refer
to
me
as
bellamy
certainly
yes

you
like
but
butter
or
not

will
melt
if
you
lose
your
temper
have
not
lost
my
temper
madam
i
am
perfectly
cool
he
replied
positively
gasping
with
fury
here
his
eye
fell
upon
the
necklace
necklace
is
that
who
gave
you
that
necklace
i
demand
to
to
know
be
careful
what
you
say
please
george
caresfoot
gave
me
the
necklace
it
cost
a
thousand
pounds
are
you
satisfied
i
am
not
satisfied
i
will
not
have
that
cursed
george
caresfoot
continually
here
i
will
send
him
back
his
necklace
i
will
assert
my
rights
as
an
englishman
and
a
spouse
i
will
sit
down
and
listen
to
the
tone
of
the
voice
checked
his
absurd
linguistic
and
physical
capers
and
caused
him
to
look
at
his
wife
she
was
standing
and
pointing
to
a
chair
her
face
was
calm
and
immovable
only
her
eyes
appeared
to
expand
and
contract
with
startling
rapidity
one
glance
was
enough
for
bellamy
he
felt
frightened
and
sat
down
in
the
indicated
chair
right
she
said
pleasantly
we
can
have
a
cosy
chat
john
you
are
a
lawyer
and
therefore
i
suppose
more
or
less
a
man
of
the
world
now
a
lawyer
and
a
man
of
the
world
i
ask
you
to
look
at
me
and
then
at
yourself
and
say
if
you
think
it
likely
or
even
possible
that
i
married
you
for
love
to
be
frank
i
did
nothing
of
the
sort
i
married
you
because
you
were
the
person
most
suited
to
my
purpose
if
you
will
only
understand
that
it
will
save
us
both
a
great
deal
of
trouble
as
for
your
talk
about
asserting
yourself
and
exercising
your
authority
it
is
simple
nonsense
you
are
very
well
in
your
way
my
dear
john
and
a
fair
attorney
but
do
you
suppose
for
one
moment
that
you
are
capable
of
matching
yourself
against
me
if
so
you
make
a
shocking
mistake
be
advised
and
do
not
try
the
experiment
but
think
that
the
bargain
is
all
my
is
not
if
you
will
behave
yourself
properly
and
be
guided
by
my
advice
i
will
make
you
one
of
the
richest
and
most
powerful
men
in
the
county
if
you
will
not
i
shall
shake
myself
free
of
you
as
soon
as
i
am
strong
enough
rise
i
must
and
will
and
if
you
will
not
rise
with
me
i
will
rise
alone
as
regards
your
complaints
of
my
not
caring
about
you
the
world
is
wide
my
dear
john
console
yourself
elsewhere
i
shall
not
be
jealous
and
now
i
think
i
have
explained
everything
it
is
so
much
more
satisfactory
to
have
a
clear
understanding
come
shall
we
go
to
lunch
but
bellamy
wanted
no
lunch
that
day
all
he
soliloquized
to
himself
between
the
pangs
of
a
racking
headache
brought
on
by
his
outburst
of
temper
sometimes
brings
its
revenges
and
if
it
does
you
may
look
out
chapter
xv
it
is
perhaps
time
that
the
reader
should
know
a
little
of
the
ancient
house
and
loyalty
where
many
of
the
personages
of
whose
history
these
pages
treat
lived
and
moved
and
had
their
being
the
abbey
house
so
called
was
in
reality
that
part
of
the
monastery
which
had
been
devoted
to
the
use
of
successive
generations
of
priors
it
was
like
the
ruins
that
lay
to
its
rear
entirely
built
of
grey
masonry
rendered
greyer
still
by
the
lichens
that
fed
upon
its
walls
which
were
of
exceeding
strength
and
thickness
it
was
a
long
irregular
building
and
roofed
with
old
and
narrow
tiles
which
from
red
had
in
the
course
of
ages
faded
to
sober
russet
the
hall
was
a
separate
building
at
its
northern
end
and
connected
with
the
main
dwelling
by
a
covered
way
the
aspect
of
the
house
was
westerly
and
the
front
windows
looked
on
to
an
expanse
of
land
heavily
timbered
with
oaks
of
large
size
some
of
them
pollards
that
might
have
pushed
their
first
leaves
in
the
time
of
william
the
conqueror
in
spring
their
vivid
green
was
diversified
by
the
reddish
brown
of
a
double
line
of
noble
a
full
half
mile
in
length
marking
the
track
of
the
that
led
to
the
roxham
behind
the
house
lay
the
walled
garden
celebrated
in
the
time
of
the
monks
as
being
a
fortnight
earlier
than
any
other
in
the
neighbourhood
skirting
the
southern
wall
of
this
garden
which
was
a
little
less
than
a
hundred
paces
long
the
visitor
reached
the
scattered
ruins
of
the
old
monastery
that
had
for
generations
served
as
a
stone
quarry
to
the
surrounding
villages
but
of
which
enough
was
left
including
a
magnificent
gateway
to
show
how
great
had
been
its
former
extent
passing
on
through
these
he
would
come
to
an
enclosure
that
marked
the
boundaries
of
the
old
graveyard
now
turned
to
agricultural
uses
and
then
to
the
church
itself
a
building
with
a
very
fine
tower
but
possessing
no
particular
interest
if
we
except
some
exceedingly
good
brasses
and
a
colossal
figure
of
a
monk
cut
out
of
the
solid
heart
of
an
oak
and
supposed
to
be
the
effigy
of
a
prior
of
the
abbey
who
died
in
the
time
of
edward
i
below
the
church
again
and
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
paces
from
it
was
the
vicarage
a
comparatively
modern
building
possessing
no
architectural
attraction
and
evidently
reared
out
of
the
remains
of
the
monastery
at
the
south
end
of
the
abbey
house
itself
lay
a
small
grass
plot
and
fringed
with
shrubberies
and
adorned
with
two
fine
one
of
these
trees
was
at
its
further
extremity
and
under
it
there
ran
a
path
cut
through
the
dense
shrubbery
this
path
which
was
edged
with
limes
and
called
the
walk
led
to
the
lake
and
debouched
in
the
little
glade
where
stood
staff
the
lake
itself
was
a
fine
piece
of
water
partly
natural
and
partly
constructed
by
the
monks
measuring
a
full
mile
round
and
from
fifty
to
two
hundred
yards
in
width
it
was
in
the
shape
of
a
shoe
the
heel
facing
west
like
the
house
but
projecting
beyond
it
the
narrow
part
representing
the
hollow
of
the
instep
being
exactly
opposite
to
it
and
the
sole
swelling
out
in
an
easterly
direction
bratham
abbey
was
altogether
a
fine
old
place
but
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
it
was
its
air
of
antiquity
and
the
solemnity
of
its
peace
it
did
not
indeed
strike
the
spirit
with
that
religious
awe
which
is
apt
to
fall
upon
us
as
we
gaze
along
the
vaulted
aisles
of
great
cathedrals
but
it
appealed
perhaps
with
equal
strength
to
the
softer
and
more
reflective
side
of
our
nature
for
generation
after
generation
that
house
had
been
the
home
of
men
like
ourselves
they
had
passed
and
were
forgotten
but
it
remained
the
sole
witness
of
the
stories
of
their
lives
hands
of
which
the
very
bones
had
long
since
crumbled
into
dust
had
planted
those
old
oaks
and
walnuts
that
still
donned
their
green
robes
in
summer
and
shed
them
in
the
autumn
to
stand
great
skeletons
through
the
winter
months
awaiting
the
resurrection
of
the
spring
there
lay
upon
the
place
and
its
surroundings
a
burden
of
dead
lives
intangible
but
none
the
less
real
the
air
was
thick
with
memories
as
suggestive
as
the
grey
dust
in
a
vault
even
in
the
summer
in
the
full
burst
of
nature
revelling
in
her
strength
the
place
was
sad
but
in
the
winter
when
the
wind
came
howling
through
the
groaning
trees
and
drove
the
grey
scud
across
an
ashy
sky
when
the
birds
were
dumb
and
there
were
no
cattle
on
the
sodden
lawn
its
isolated
melancholy
was
a
palpable
thing
that
hoary
house
might
have
been
a
gateway
of
the
dim
land
we
call
the
past
looking
down
in
stony
sorrow
on
the
follies
of
those
who
so
soon
must
cross
its
portals
and
to
the
wise
who
could
hear
the
lesson
pregnant
with
echoes
of
the
warning
voices
of
many
generations
here
it
was
that
angela
grew
up
to
womanhood
some
nine
and
a
half
years
had
passed
from
the
date
of
the
events
described
in
the
foregoing
pages
when
one
evening
fraser
bethought
him
that
he
had
been
indoors
all
day
and
proposed
reading
till
late
that
night
and
that
therefore
he
had
better
take
some
exercise
a
tall
and
somewhat
man
with
dark
eyes
a
sensitive
mouth
and
that
peculiar
stoop
and
pallor
of
complexion
which
those
devoted
to
much
study
almost
invariably
acquire
he
had
written
on
his
face
his
history
was
a
sufficiently
common
one
he
possessed
academical
abilities
of
a
very
high
order
and
had
in
his
youth
distinguished
himself
greatly
at
college
both
as
a
classical
and
a
mathematical
scholar
when
quite
young
he
was
appointed
through
the
influence
of
a
relation
to
his
present
living
where
the
income
was
good
and
the
population
very
small
indeed
freed
from
all
necessity
for
exertion
he
shut
himself
up
with
his
books
having
his
little
round
of
parish
work
for
relaxation
and
never
sought
to
emerge
from
the
quiet
of
his
aimless
studies
to
struggle
for
fame
and
place
in
the
laborious
world
fraser
was
what
people
call
an
able
man
thrown
away
if
they
had
known
his
shy
sensitive
nature
a
little
better
they
would
have
understood
that
he
was
infinitely
more
suited
for
the
solitary
and
peaceful
lot
in
life
which
he
had
chosen
than
to
become
a
unit
in
the
turbulent
and
greedy
crowd
that
is
struggling
through
all
the
ages
up
the
slippery
slopes
of
the
temple
of
that
greatest
of
our
there
are
many
such
men
probably
you
my
reader
know
one
or
two
with
infinite
labour
they
store
up
honey
from
the
fields
of
knowledge
collect
endless
data
from
the
statistics
of
science
pile
up
their
calculations
against
the
very
stars
and
all
to
no
end
as
a
rule
they
do
not
write
books
they
gather
the
learning
for
the
sake
and
for
the
very
love
of
it
rejoice
to
count
their
labour
lost
and
thus
they
go
on
from
year
to
year
until
the
golden
bowl
is
broken
and
the
pitcher
broken
at
the
fountain
and
the
gathered
knowledge
sinks
or
appears
to
sink
back
to
whence
it
came
alas
that
one
generation
can
not
hand
on
its
wisdom
and
especially
its
another
in
its
perfect
form
if
it
could
we
men
should
soon
become
as
gods
it
was
a
mild
evening
in
the
latter
end
of
october
when
fraser
started
on
his
walk
the
moon
was
up
in
the
heavens
as
he
an
hour
later
made
his
way
from
the
side
of
the
lake
where
he
had
been
wandering
back
to
the
churchyard
through
which
he
had
to
pass
to
reach
the
vicarage
just
before
he
came
to
the
gate
however
he
was
surprised
in
such
a
solitary
spot
to
see
a
slight
figure
leaning
against
the
wall
opposite
the
place
where
lay
the
mortal
remains
of
the
old
squire
and
his
hilda
he
stood
still
and
watched
the
figure
appeared
to
be
gazing
steadily
at
the
graves
presently
it
turned
and
saw
him
and
he
recognized
the
great
grey
eyes
and
golden
hair
of
little
angela
caresfoot
my
dear
what
are
you
doing
here
at
this
time
of
night
he
asked
in
some
surprise
she
blushed
a
little
as
she
shook
hands
rather
awkwardly
with
him
be
angry
with
me
she
said
in
a
deprecatory
voice
i
was
so
lonely
this
evening
that
i
came
here
for
here
for
company
what
do
you
mean
she
hung
her
head
he
said
me
what
you
quite
know
myself
how
can
i
tell
you
he
looked
more
puzzled
than
ever
and
she
observed
it
and
went
on
will
try
to
tell
you
but
you
must
not
be
cross
like
pigott
when
she
can
not
understand
me
sometimes
i
feel
ever
so
much
alone
as
though
i
was
looking
for
something
and
could
not
find
it
and
then
i
come
and
stand
here
and
look
at
my
grave
and
i
get
company
and
am
not
lonely
any
more
that
is
all
i
know
i
can
not
tell
you
any
more
do
you
think
me
silly
pigott
think
you
are
a
very
strange
child
are
you
not
afraid
to
come
here
alone
at
night
no
nobody
comes
here
the
people
in
the
village
dare
not
come
here
after
dark
because
they
say
that
the
ruins
are
full
of
spirits
jakes
told
me
that
but
i
must
be
stupid
i
can
not
see
them
and
i
want
so
very
much
to
see
them
i
hope
it
is
not
wrong
but
i
told
my
father
so
the
other
day
and
he
turned
white
and
was
angry
with
pigott
for
giving
me
such
ideas
but
you
know
pigott
did
not
give
them
to
me
at
all
i
am
not
afraid
to
come
i
like
it
it
is
so
quiet
and
if
one
listens
enough
in
the
quiet
i
always
think
one
may
hear
something
that
other
people
do
not
you
hear
anything
then
i
hear
things
but
i
can
not
understand
them
listen
to
the
wind
in
the
branches
of
that
tree
the
chestnut
off
which
the
leaf
is
falling
now
it
says
something
if
only
i
could
catch
child
yes
you
are
right
in
a
way
all
nature
tells
the
same
eternal
tale
if
our
ears
were
not
stopped
to
its
voices
he
answered
with
a
sigh
indeed
the
talk
had
struck
a
vein
of
thought
familiar
to
his
own
mind
and
what
is
more
it
deeply
interested
him
there
was
a
quaint
wisdom
in
it
is
pleasant
is
it
not
fraser
said
the
little
maid
everything
is
dying
the
things
die
softly
without
any
pain
this
year
last
year
they
were
all
killed
in
the
rain
and
wind
look
at
that
cloud
floating
across
the
moon
is
it
not
beautiful
i
wonder
what
it
is
the
shadow
of
i
think
all
the
clouds
are
shadows
of
something
up
in
when
there
are
no
clouds
then
heaven
is
quite
still
and
heaven
is
always
it
i
understand
how
it
can
be
always
happy
if
go
there
there
must
be
so
many
to
be
sorry
fraser
mused
a
little
that
last
remark
was
difficult
to
answer
he
looked
at
the
fleecy
cloud
and
falling
into
her
humour
think
your
cloud
is
the
shadow
of
an
eagle
carrying
a
lamb
to
its
little
i
think
she
answered
confidently
it
is
the
shadow
of
an
angel
carrying
a
baby
again
he
was
silenced
the
idea
was
infinitely
more
poetical
than
his
own
he
reflected
a
child
of
a
curious
mental
before
he
could
pursue
the
thought
further
she
broke
in
upon
it
in
quite
a
different
strain
you
seen
jack
and
jill
they
are
jack
and
jill
my
ravens
of
course
i
got
them
out
of
the
old
tree
with
a
hole
in
it
at
the
end
of
the
tree
at
the
end
of
the
lake
why
the
hole
where
the
ravens
nest
is
fifty
feet
up
who
got
them
for
you
got
them
myself
know
afraid
to
go
up
he
said
he
should
fall
and
that
the
old
birds
would
peck
his
eyes
so
i
went
by
myself
one
morning
quite
early
with
a
bag
tied
round
my
neck
and
got
up
it
was
hard
work
and
i
nearly
tumbled
once
but
i
got
on
the
bough
beneath
the
hole
at
last
it
shook
very
much
it
is
so
rotten
you
have
no
idea
there
were
three
little
ones
in
the
nest
all
with
great
mouths
i
took
two
and
left
one
for
the
old
birds
when
i
was
nearly
down
again
the
old
birds
found
me
out
and
flew
at
me
and
beat
my
head
with
their
wings
and
they
did
peck
look
here
and
she
showed
him
a
scar
on
her
hand
where
they
pecked
but
i
stuck
to
my
bag
and
got
down
at
last
and
glad
i
did
for
we
are
great
friends
now
and
i
am
sure
the
cross
old
birds
would
be
quite
pleased
if
they
knew
how
nicely
i
am
educating
their
young
ones
and
how
their
manners
have
improved
but
i
say
fraser
tell
pigott
she
can
not
climb
trees
and
does
not
like
to
see
me
do
it
she
does
not
know
i
went
after
them
fraser
laughed
tell
her
angela
my
dear
but
you
must
be
might
tumble
and
kill
think
i
shall
fraser
unless
i
am
meant
to
god
looks
after
me
as
much
when
i
am
up
a
tree
as
when
i
am
upon
the
once
more
he
had
nothing
to
say
he
could
not
venture
to
disturb
her
faith
will
walk
home
with
you
my
dear
tell
me
angela
would
you
like
to
learn
what
and
the
languages
that
other
nations
nations
that
have
passed
away
used
to
talk
and
how
to
calculate
numbers
and
i
should
like
to
learn
very
much
but
who
will
teach
me
i
have
learnt
all
pigott
knows
two
years
ago
and
since
then
i
have
been
trying
to
learn
about
the
trees
and
flowers
and
stars
but
i
look
and
watch
and
my
dear
contact
with
nature
is
the
highest
education
but
the
mind
that
would
appreciate
her
wonders
must
have
a
foundation
of
knowledge
to
work
upon
the
uneducated
man
is
rarely
sensitive
to
the
thousand
beauties
and
marvels
of
the
fields
around
him
and
the
skies
above
him
but
if
you
like
i
will
teach
you
angela
i
am
practically
an
idle
man
and
it
will
give
me
great
pleasure
but
you
must
promise
to
work
and
do
what
i
tell
how
good
you
are
of
course
i
will
work
when
am
i
to
begin
if
you
like
but
i
must
speak
to
your
father
her
face
fell
a
little
at
the
mention
of
her
name
but
presently
she
said
father
he
will
not
care
if
i
learn
or
not
i
hardly
ever
see
my
father
he
does
not
like
me
i
see
nobody
but
pigott
and
you
and
old
jakes
and
sam
sometimes
you
need
not
ask
my
father
he
will
never
miss
me
whilst
i
am
learning
ask
at
that
moment
pigott
herself
hove
into
view
in
a
great
flurry
here
you
are
miss
angela
where
have
you
been
to
you
naughty
girl
at
some
of
your
tricks
again
be
bound
frightening
the
life
out
of
a
body
just
too
bad
of
you
miss
the
little
girl
looked
at
her
with
a
peculiarly
winning
smile
and
took
her
very
solid
hand
between
her
own
tiny
palms
be
cross
pigott
dear
she
said
mean
to
frighten
you
i
help
indeed
and
then
i
stopped
talking
to
there
i
should
just
like
to
know
who
can
be
cross
with
you
when
you
put
on
those
ways
are
your
feet
wet
ah
i
thought
so
run
on
in
and
take
them
that
be
just
a
little
difficult
and
she
was
gone
with
a
merry
laugh
sir
just
like
her
catching
a
body
up
like
and
twisting
what
she
says
till
you
know
which
is
head
and
which
is
heels
be
bound
you
found
her
down
yonder
and
she
nodded
towards
the
churchyard
pigott
drew
a
little
nearer
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
my
belief
sir
that
that
child
sees
she
is
just
the
oddest
child
i
ever
saw
nothing
she
likes
better
than
to
slip
out
of
a
night
and
to
go
to
that
there
beastly
churchyard
saving
your
presence
for
as
she
calls
sort
of
company
indeed
and
it
is
just
the
same
way
with
storms
you
remember
that
dreadful
gale
a
month
ago
the
one
that
took
down
the
north
grove
and
blew
the
spire
off
rewtham
church
well
just
when
it
was
at
its
worst
and
i
was
and
praying
that
the
roof
might
keep
over
our
heads
i
look
round
for
angela
and
see
her
of
your
tricks
again
thinks
i
to
myself
and
just
then
up
comes
jakes
to
say
that
sam
had
seen
little
missy
creeping
down
the
tunnel
walk
i
was
that
scared
that
i
ran
down
got
hold
of
sam
for
jakes
said
he
go
out
with
all
them
trees
about
in
the
air
like
not
for
a
thousand
pounds
and
off
we
set
after
here
pigott
paused
to
groan
at
the
recollection
of
that
walk
said
fraser
who
was
rather
about
this
queer
child
interested
him
did
you
find
her
sir
you
know
where
the
old
wall
runs
out
into
the
water
before
staff
there
well
at
the
end
of
it
a
post
sunk
in
with
a
ring
in
it
to
tie
boats
to
now
would
you
believe
it
out
there
at
the
end
of
the
wall
and
tied
to
the
ring
by
a
scarf
passed
round
her
middle
was
that
dreadful
child
she
was
standing
there
her
back
against
the
post
right
in
the
teeth
of
the
gale
with
the
spray
dashing
over
her
her
arms
stretched
out
before
her
her
hat
gone
her
long
hair
standing
out
behind
straight
as
an
iron
bar
and
her
eyes
flashing
as
though
they
were
on
fire
and
all
the
while
there
were
the
great
trees
crashing
down
all
round
in
a
way
enough
to
make
a
body
sick
with
fright
we
got
her
back
safe
thank
god
but
how
long
we
shall
keep
her
sure
i
know
now
she
is
drowning
herself
in
the
lake
for
she
takes
to
the
water
like
a
duck
and
now
breaking
her
neck
off
trees
and
now
going
to
ghosts
in
the
churchyard
for
company
wearing
me
to
the
what
it
fraser
smiled
for
to
tell
the
truth
bones
were
pretty
comfortably
covered
he
said
would
not
part
with
her
for
all
her
wicked
deeds
would
you
with
her
answered
pigott
in
hot
indignation
with
my
little
beauty
i
would
rather
part
with
my
head
the
love
there
never
was
another
like
her
nor
never
will
be
with
her
sweet
ways
and
if
i
know
anything
about
girls
be
the
beauty
of
england
she
will
made
for
a
beautiful
woman
and
look
at
them
eyes
and
forehead
and
did
you
ever
see
the
like
and
as
for
her
queer
ways
what
can
you
expect
from
a
child
as
has
got
a
great
empty
mind
and
nothing
to
put
in
it
and
no
one
to
talk
to
but
a
common
woman
like
me
and
a
she
dropped
her
is
a
miser
and
hates
the
sight
of
his
own
flesh
and
blood
you
should
not
say
such
things
pigott
now
i
will
tell
you
something
i
am
going
on
to
ask
your
master
to
allow
me
to
educate
right
glad
to
hear
it
sir
sharp
enough
to
learn
anything
and
kind
of
you
to
teach
her
if
you
can
make
her
mind
like
what
her
body
will
be
if
she
lives
somebody
will
be
a
lucky
man
one
of
these
days
sir
and
many
thanks
for
bringing
missy
next
day
angela
began
her
education
chapter
xvi
reader
we
are
about
to
see
angela
again
and
to
see
a
good
deal
of
her
but
you
must
be
prepared
for
a
change
in
her
personal
appearance
for
the
curtain
has
been
down
for
ten
years
since
last
you
met
the
child
whose
odd
propensities
excited
wonder
and
indignation
and
interest
and
ten
years
as
we
all
know
can
work
many
changes
in
the
history
of
the
world
and
individuals
in
ten
years
some
have
been
swept
clean
off
the
board
and
their
places
taken
by
others
a
few
have
grown
richer
many
poorer
some
of
us
sadder
some
wiser
and
all
of
us
ten
years
older
now
this
was
exactly
what
had
happened
to
little
is
the
angela
we
knew
as
little
and
ten
years
make
curious
differences
between
the
slim
child
of
nine
and
a
half
and
the
woman
of
nearly
twenty
when
we
last
saw
her
angela
was
about
to
commence
her
education
let
us
ourselves
on
the
memorable
evening
when
after
ten
years
of
study
fraser
a
master
by
no
means
easily
pleased
expressed
himself
unable
to
teach
her
any
more
it
is
christmas
eve
drip
drop
drip
falls
the
rain
from
the
leafless
boughs
on
to
the
sodden
earth
the
apology
for
daylight
that
has
been
doing
its
dull
duty
for
the
last
few
hours
is
slowly
effacing
itself
and
the
gale
is
celebrating
the
fact
and
showing
its
joy
at
the
of
the
melancholy
night
by
howling
its
loudest
through
the
trees
and
flogging
the
flying
scud
it
has
brought
with
it
from
the
sea
till
it
whirls
across
the
sky
like
a
succession
of
ghostly
racehorses
this
is
outside
the
vicarage
let
us
look
within
in
a
chair
in
the
comfortable
study
near
to
a
table
covered
with
books
and
holding
some
loose
sheets
of
foolscap
in
his
hand
sits
fraser
his
hair
is
a
little
greyer
than
when
he
began
education
about
as
grey
as
rather
accommodating
hair
will
get
at
the
age
of
otherwise
his
general
appearance
is
much
the
same
and
his
face
as
refined
and
gentlemanlike
as
ever
presently
he
lays
down
the
sheets
of
paper
which
he
has
been
studying
attentively
and
says
solution
is
perfectly
sound
angela
but
you
have
arrived
at
it
in
a
characteristic
fashion
and
by
your
own
road
not
but
what
your
method
has
some
one
thing
it
is
more
concise
than
my
own
but
on
the
other
hand
it
shows
a
feminine
weakness
it
is
not
possible
to
follow
every
step
from
your
premises
to
your
conclusion
correct
as
it
says
a
low
voice
with
a
happy
ripple
in
it
the
owner
of
which
is
busy
with
some
out
of
range
of
the
ring
of
light
thrown
by
the
double
often
blame
me
for
jumping
to
conclusions
but
what
does
it
matter
provided
they
are
right
the
whole
secret
is
that
i
used
the
equivalent
algebraic
formula
but
suppressed
the
working
in
order
to
puzzle
you
and
the
voice
laughed
sweetly
is
not
worthy
of
a
mathematician
said
fraser
with
some
irritation
is
nothing
but
a
trick
a
de
solution
is
correct
you
say
i
maintain
that
it
is
perfectly
mathematical
the
object
of
mathematics
is
to
arrive
at
the
et
preterea
come
out
of
that
corner
my
dear
i
hate
arguing
with
a
person
i
can
not
see
but
there
there
what
is
the
use
of
arguing
at
all
the
fact
is
angela
you
are
a
mathematician
and
i
am
only
i
am
obliged
to
stick
to
the
old
tracks
you
cut
a
roman
road
of
your
own
great
masters
are
entitled
to
do
that
the
algebraic
formula
never
occurred
to
me
when
i
worked
the
problem
out
and
it
took
me
two
days
to
are
trying
to
make
me
vain
you
forget
that
whatever
i
know
which
is
just
enough
to
show
me
how
much
i
have
to
learn
i
have
learnt
from
you
as
for
being
your
superior
in
mathematics
i
think
that
as
a
clergyman
you
should
make
such
a
statement
here
is
your
and
the
owner
of
the
voice
came
forward
into
the
ring
of
light
she
was
tall
beyond
the
ordinary
height
of
woman
and
possessed
unusual
beauty
of
form
that
the
grey
dress
she
wore
was
well
calculated
to
display
her
complexion
which
was
of
a
dazzling
fairness
was
set
off
by
the
darkness
of
the
lashes
that
curled
over
the
deep
grey
eyes
the
face
itself
was
rounded
and
very
lovely
and
surmounted
by
an
ample
forehead
whilst
her
hair
which
was
twisted
into
a
massive
knot
was
of
a
tinge
of
chestnut
gold
and
marked
with
ripples
the
charm
of
her
face
however
did
not
as
is
so
often
the
case
begin
and
end
with
its
physical
attractions
there
was
more
much
more
in
it
than
that
but
how
is
it
possible
to
describe
on
paper
a
presence
at
once
so
full
of
grace
and
dignity
of
the
soft
loveliness
of
woman
and
of
a
higher
and
more
spiritual
beauty
there
hangs
in
the
louvre
a
picture
by
raphael
which
represents
a
saint
passing
with
light
steps
over
the
prostrate
form
of
a
dragon
there
is
in
that
face
the
equal
of
which
has
been
rarely
if
ever
put
on
canvas
a
blending
of
earthly
beauty
and
of
the
calm
gaze
that
holy
dignity
which
can
only
come
to
such
as
are
in
truth
and
in
deed
in
will
give
to
those
who
know
it
a
better
idea
of
what
angela
was
like
than
any
written
description
at
times
but
ah
how
rarely
we
may
have
seen
some
such
look
as
that
she
wore
on
the
faces
of
those
around
us
it
may
be
brought
by
a
great
sorrow
or
be
the
companion
of
an
overwhelming
joy
it
may
announce
the
consummation
of
some
sublime
or
convey
the
swift
assurance
of
an
everlasting
love
it
is
to
be
found
alike
on
the
features
of
the
happy
mother
as
she
kisses
her
babe
and
on
the
pallid
countenance
of
the
saint
sinking
to
his
rest
the
sharp
moment
that
brings
us
nearer
god
and
goes
nigh
to
piercing
the
veil
that
hides
his
presence
is
the
occasion
that
calls
it
into
being
it
is
a
beauty
born
of
the
murmuring
sound
of
the
harps
of
heaven
it
is
the
light
of
the
eternal
lamp
gleaming
faintly
through
its
earthly
casket
this
before
which
all
wickedness
must
feel
ashamed
had
found
a
home
in
grey
eyes
there
was
a
strange
nobility
about
her
whether
it
dwelt
in
the
stately
form
or
on
the
broad
brow
or
in
the
large
glance
of
the
deep
eyes
it
is
not
possible
to
say
but
it
was
certainly
a
part
of
herself
as
as
her
face
or
features
she
might
well
have
been
the
inspiration
of
the
lines
that
run
in
her
might
beloved
grand
in
her
sway
truth
with
her
eyes
beloved
clearer
than
day
holy
and
pure
beloved
spotless
and
free
is
there
one
thing
beloved
fairer
than
thee
fraser
absently
set
down
the
tea
that
angela
was
giving
him
when
we
took
the
liberty
to
describe
her
personal
appearance
angela
read
a
shall
i
read
anything
you
like
please
thus
enjoined
she
went
to
a
bookshelf
and
taking
down
two
volumes
handed
one
to
fraser
and
then
opening
her
copy
at
haphazard
announced
the
page
to
her
companion
and
sitting
down
began
to
read
what
sound
is
this
now
soft
and
melodious
as
the
sweep
of
a
summer
gale
over
a
southern
sea
and
now
again
like
to
the
distant
stamp
and
rush
and
break
of
the
wave
of
battle
what
can
it
be
but
the
roll
of
those
magnificent
hexameters
with
which
homer
charms
a
listening
world
and
rarely
have
english
lips
given
them
with
a
juster
cadence
my
dear
shut
up
your
book
you
are
as
good
a
greek
scholar
as
i
can
make
you
shut
up
your
book
for
the
last
time
your
education
my
dear
angela
is
satisfactorily
completed
i
have
succeeded
with
fraser
said
angela
you
mean
to
say
that
i
am
to
stop
now
just
as
i
have
begun
to
learn
dear
you
have
learnt
everything
that
i
can
teach
you
and
besides
i
am
going
away
the
day
after
away
and
then
and
there
without
the
slightest
warning
for
all
her
beauty
and
learning
very
much
resembled
the
rest
of
her
into
tears
come
angela
said
fraser
in
a
voice
meant
to
be
gruff
but
only
succeeding
in
being
husky
for
oddly
enough
it
is
trying
even
to
a
clergyman
on
the
wrong
side
of
to
be
wept
over
by
a
lovely
woman
be
nonsensical
i
am
only
going
for
a
few
at
this
intelligence
she
pulled
up
a
little
she
said
between
her
sobs
you
frightened
me
how
could
you
be
so
cruel
where
are
you
going
to
am
going
for
a
long
trip
in
southern
europe
do
you
know
that
i
have
scarcely
been
away
from
this
place
for
twenty
years
so
i
mean
to
celebrate
the
conclusion
of
our
studies
by
taking
a
wish
you
would
take
me
with
fraser
coloured
slightly
and
his
eye
brightened
he
sighed
as
he
am
afraid
my
dear
that
it
would
be
something
warned
angela
not
to
pursue
the
subject
angela
i
believe
that
it
is
usual
on
the
occasion
of
the
severance
of
a
scholastic
connection
to
deliver
something
in
the
nature
of
a
farewell
oration
well
i
am
not
going
to
do
that
but
i
want
you
to
listen
to
a
few
she
did
not
answer
but
drawing
a
stool
to
a
corner
of
the
fireplace
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
sat
down
almost
at
his
feet
clasping
her
knees
with
her
hands
and
gazing
rather
sadly
into
the
fire
have
dear
angela
he
began
educated
in
a
somewhat
unusual
way
with
the
result
that
after
ten
years
of
steady
work
that
has
been
always
interesting
though
sometimes
arduous
you
have
acquired
information
denied
to
the
vast
majority
of
your
sex
whilst
at
the
same
time
you
could
be
put
to
the
blush
in
many
things
by
a
of
fifteen
for
instance
though
i
firmly
believe
that
you
could
at
the
present
moment
take
a
double
first
at
the
university
your
knowledge
of
english
literature
is
almost
nil
and
your
history
of
the
weakest
all
a
ordinary
accomplishments
such
as
drawing
playing
singing
have
of
necessity
been
to
a
great
extent
neglected
since
i
was
not
able
to
teach
them
to
you
myself
and
you
have
had
to
be
guided
solely
by
books
and
by
the
light
of
nature
in
giving
to
them
such
time
as
you
could
spare
mind
on
the
other
hand
has
been
daily
saturated
with
the
noblest
thoughts
of
the
intellectual
giants
of
two
thousand
years
ago
and
would
in
that
respect
be
as
much
in
place
in
a
grecian
maiden
living
before
the
time
of
christ
as
in
an
english
girl
of
the
nineteenth
century
have
educated
you
thus
angela
partly
by
accident
and
partly
by
design
you
will
remember
when
you
began
to
come
here
some
ten
years
were
a
little
thing
i
had
offered
to
give
you
some
teaching
because
you
interested
me
and
i
saw
that
you
were
running
wild
in
mind
and
body
but
when
i
had
undertaken
the
task
i
was
somewhat
puzzled
how
to
carry
it
out
it
is
one
thing
to
offer
to
educate
a
little
girl
and
another
to
do
it
not
knowing
where
to
begin
i
fell
back
upon
the
latin
grammar
where
i
had
begun
myself
and
so
by
degrees
you
slid
into
the
curriculum
of
a
classical
and
mathematical
education
then
after
a
year
or
two
i
perceived
your
power
of
work
and
your
great
natural
ability
and
i
formed
a
design
i
said
to
myself
will
see
how
far
a
woman
cultivated
under
favourable
conditions
can
go
i
will
patiently
teach
this
girl
till
the
literature
of
greece
and
rome
become
as
familiar
to
her
as
her
till
figures
and
symbols
hide
no
mysteries
from
her
till
she
can
read
the
heavens
like
a
book
i
will
teach
her
mind
to
follow
the
secret
ways
of
knowledge
i
will
train
it
till
it
can
soar
above
its
fellows
like
a
falcon
above
angela
my
proud
design
pursued
steadily
through
many
years
has
been
at
length
accomplished
your
bright
intellect
has
risen
to
the
strain
i
have
put
upon
it
and
you
are
at
this
moment
one
of
the
best
scholars
of
my
she
flushed
to
the
eyes
at
this
high
praise
and
was
about
to
speak
but
he
stopped
her
with
a
motion
of
the
hand
and
went
on
have
recognized
in
teaching
you
a
fact
but
too
little
known
that
a
classical
education
properly
understood
is
the
foundation
of
all
learning
there
is
little
that
is
worth
saying
which
has
not
already
been
beautifully
said
by
the
ancients
little
that
is
worthy
of
meditation
on
which
they
have
not
already
profoundly
reflected
save
indeed
the
one
great
subject
of
christian
meditation
this
foundation
my
dear
angela
you
possess
to
an
eminent
degree
henceforth
you
will
need
no
assistance
from
me
or
any
other
man
for
to
your
trained
mind
all
ordinary
knowledge
will
be
easy
to
assimilate
you
will
receive
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
a
parting
present
from
myself
in
the
shape
of
a
box
of
carefully
chosen
books
on
european
literature
and
history
devote
yourself
to
the
study
of
these
and
of
the
german
language
which
was
your
native
tongue
for
the
next
year
and
then
i
shall
consider
that
you
are
fairly
finished
and
then
too
my
dear
angela
i
shall
expect
to
reap
a
full
reward
for
my
is
it
that
you
will
expect
of
me
shall
expect
angela
and
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
in
his
shall
expect
to
see
you
take
your
proper
place
in
your
generation
i
shall
say
your
own
line
become
a
critical
scholar
a
practical
mathematician
perhaps
that
is
what
you
are
most
suited
for
with
your
imaginative
writer
of
fiction
for
remember
that
fiction
properly
understood
and
directed
to
worthy
aims
is
the
noblest
and
most
as
it
is
also
the
most
difficult
of
the
in
watching
the
success
that
will
assuredly
attend
you
in
this
or
any
other
line
i
shall
be
amply
rewarded
for
my
angela
shook
her
head
with
a
gesture
of
doubt
but
he
did
not
wait
for
her
to
answer
my
dear
i
must
not
keep
you
any
is
quite
dark
and
blowing
a
gale
of
to
say
one
more
word
remember
that
all
this
perhaps
but
still
none
the
less
means
to
an
end
there
are
two
educations
the
education
of
the
mind
and
the
education
of
the
soul
unless
you
minister
to
the
latter
all
the
time
and
toil
spent
upon
the
former
will
prove
to
little
purpose
the
learning
will
it
is
true
remain
but
it
will
be
as
the
quartz
out
of
which
the
gold
has
been
already
crushed
or
the
dry
husks
of
corn
it
will
be
valueless
and
turn
to
no
good
use
will
serve
only
to
feed
the
swine
of
intellectual
voluptuousness
and
infidelity
it
is
believe
me
the
higher
learning
of
the
soul
that
gilds
our
earthly
lore
the
loftier
object
of
all
education
is
so
to
train
the
intellect
that
it
may
become
competent
to
understand
something
however
little
of
the
nature
of
our
god
and
to
the
true
christian
the
real
end
of
learning
is
the
appreciation
of
his
attributes
as
exemplified
in
his
mysteries
and
earthly
wonders
but
perhaps
that
is
a
subject
on
which
you
are
as
well
fitted
to
discourse
as
i
am
so
i
will
not
enter
into
it
my
dear
answer
to
this
long
oration
was
a
simple
one
she
rose
slowly
from
her
low
seat
and
putting
her
hands
upon
shoulders
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
and
shall
i
ever
learn
to
be
grateful
enough
for
all
i
owe
you
what
should
i
have
been
now
but
for
you
how
good
and
patient
you
have
been
to
me
this
embrace
affected
the
clergyman
strangely
he
put
his
hand
to
his
heart
and
a
troubled
look
came
into
his
eyes
thrusting
her
gently
away
from
him
he
sat
down
he
said
presently
away
now
dear
i
am
tired
i
shall
see
you
at
church
to
say
and
so
she
went
homewards
through
the
wind
and
storm
little
knowing
that
she
left
her
master
to
struggle
with
a
tempest
far
more
tremendous
than
that
which
raged
around
her
as
for
him
as
the
door
closed
he
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
god
i
have
not
put
it
off
too
long
he
said
to
himself
now
for
sermon
sleep
for
the
young
laughter
for
the
happy
work
for
old
work
work
and
thus
it
was
that
angela
became
a
scholar
chapter
xvii
the
winter
months
passed
away
slowly
for
angela
but
not
by
any
means
unhappily
though
she
was
quite
alone
and
missed
fraser
sadly
she
found
considerable
consolation
in
his
present
of
books
and
in
the
thought
that
she
was
getting
a
good
hold
of
her
new
subjects
of
study
and
then
came
the
wonder
of
the
spring
with
its
rush
of
budding
life
and
who
least
of
all
angela
could
be
sad
in
springtime
but
nevertheless
that
spring
marked
an
important
change
in
our
heroine
for
it
was
during
its
sweet
hours
when
having
put
her
books
aside
she
would
roam
alone
or
in
company
with
her
ravens
through
the
woods
around
the
lake
that
a
feeling
of
restlessness
amounting
at
times
almost
to
dissatisfaction
took
possession
of
her
indeed
as
the
weeks
crept
on
and
she
drew
near
the
completion
of
her
twentieth
year
she
realized
with
a
sigh
that
she
could
no
longer
call
herself
a
girl
and
began
to
feel
that
her
life
was
incomplete
that
something
was
wanting
in
it
and
this
was
what
was
wanting
in
life
she
had
if
we
except
her
nurse
no
one
to
love
and
she
had
so
much
love
to
give
did
she
but
guess
it
the
still
recesses
of
her
heart
already
tremble
to
the
footfall
of
one
now
drawing
near
out
of
the
multitude
of
the
lives
around
her
a
life
is
marked
to
mingle
with
her
own
she
does
not
know
it
but
as
the
first
reflection
of
the
dawn
strikes
the
unconscious
sky
and
shadows
the
coming
of
its
king
so
the
red
flush
that
now
so
often
springs
unbidden
to
her
brow
tells
of
twilight
ended
and
proclaims
the
advent
of
life
and
love
called
her
father
one
day
as
he
heard
her
footsteps
passing
his
study
in
here
i
want
to
speak
to
his
daughter
stopped
and
a
look
of
blank
astonishment
spread
itself
over
her
face
she
had
not
been
called
into
that
study
for
years
she
entered
however
as
bidden
her
father
who
was
seated
at
his
which
was
piled
up
with
did
not
greatly
differ
in
appearance
from
what
he
was
when
we
last
saw
him
twenty
years
ago
his
frame
had
grown
more
massive
and
acquired
a
slight
stoop
but
he
was
still
a
young
man
and
certainly
did
not
appear
a
day
more
than
his
age
of
the
eyes
however
so
long
as
no
one
was
looking
at
them
had
contracted
a
concentrated
stare
as
though
they
were
eternally
gazing
at
some
object
in
space
and
this
appearance
was
rendered
the
more
marked
by
an
apparently
permanent
puckering
of
the
skin
of
the
forehead
the
moment
however
that
they
came
under
the
fire
of
anybody
optics
and
oddly
enough
more
particularly
those
of
his
own
daughter
the
stare
vanished
and
they
grew
shifty
and
uncertain
to
a
curious
degree
philip
was
employed
in
adding
up
something
when
his
daughter
entered
and
motioned
to
her
to
sit
down
she
did
so
and
fixed
her
great
grey
eyes
on
him
with
some
curiosity
the
effect
was
remarkable
her
father
fidgeted
made
a
mistake
in
his
calculations
glanced
all
round
the
room
with
his
shifty
eyes
ah
how
changed
from
those
bold
black
eyes
with
which
maria
lee
fell
in
love
years
ago
and
finally
threw
down
his
pen
with
an
exclamation
that
would
have
shocked
angela
had
she
understood
it
often
angela
have
i
asked
you
not
to
stare
me
out
of
countenance
it
is
a
most
unladylike
trick
of
she
blushed
painfully
beg
your
pardon
i
forgot
i
will
look
out
of
the
be
a
fool
look
like
other
people
but
now
i
want
to
speak
to
you
in
the
first
place
i
find
that
the
household
expenditure
for
the
last
year
was
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
that
is
more
than
i
can
afford
it
must
not
exceed
three
hundred
this
will
do
my
best
to
keep
the
expenses
down
father
but
i
can
assure
you
that
there
is
no
money
wasted
then
came
a
pause
which
after
humming
and
hawing
a
little
philip
was
the
first
to
break
you
know
that
i
saw
your
cousin
george
yesterday
he
is
back
at
last
at
pigott
told
me
that
he
had
come
he
has
been
away
a
long
did
you
last
see
him
i
was
about
thirteen
i
believe
before
he
lost
the
election
and
went
has
been
down
here
several
times
since
then
i
wonder
that
you
did
not
see
always
disliked
him
and
kept
out
of
his
you
dislike
him
more
than
i
do
but
i
keep
good
friends
with
him
for
all
that
and
you
must
do
the
same
now
look
here
angela
will
you
promise
to
keep
a
secret
father
if
you
wish
then
i
appear
to
be
a
poor
man
i
and
remember
he
added
hastily
with
reference
to
household
expenses
i
am
poor
but
as
a
matter
of
here
he
sunk
his
voice
and
glanced
suspiciously
am
worth
at
this
moment
nearly
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
in
hard
is
six
thousand
pounds
a
year
at
four
per
commented
angela
without
a
hesitation
i
really
think
you
might
put
a
flue
into
the
old
greenhouse
and
allow
a
shilling
a
week
to
mother
nobody
but
a
woman
would
have
interrupted
with
such
nonsense
listen
you
must
have
heard
how
i
was
disinherited
on
account
of
my
marriage
with
your
mother
and
the
isleworth
estates
left
to
your
cousin
george
and
how
with
a
refined
ingenuity
he
was
forbidden
to
bequeath
them
back
to
me
or
to
my
children
but
mark
this
he
is
not
forbidden
to
sell
them
to
me
no
doubt
the
old
man
never
dreamt
that
i
should
have
the
money
to
buy
them
but
you
see
i
have
almost
did
you
get
so
much
money
it
first
i
took
the
gold
plate
my
grandfather
bought
and
sold
it
i
had
no
right
to
do
it
but
i
could
not
afford
to
have
so
much
capital
lying
idle
it
fetched
nearly
five
thousand
pounds
with
this
i
speculated
successfully
in
two
years
i
had
eighteen
thousand
the
eighteen
thousand
i
invested
in
a
fourth
share
in
a
when
money
was
scarce
and
coals
cheap
coals
rose
enormously
just
then
and
in
five
time
i
sold
my
share
to
the
for
thousand
in
addition
to
thousand
received
by
way
of
interest
since
then
i
have
not
speculated
for
fear
my
luck
should
desert
me
i
have
simply
allowed
the
money
to
accumulate
on
mortgage
and
other
investments
and
bided
my
time
for
i
have
sworn
to
have
those
estates
back
before
i
die
it
is
for
this
cause
that
i
have
toiled
and
thought
and
screwed
and
been
cut
by
the
whole
neighbourhood
for
twenty
years
but
now
i
think
that
with
your
help
my
time
is
help
what
is
it
that
you
wish
me
to
do
answered
her
father
nervously
tapping
his
pencil
on
the
before
him
is
not
very
fond
of
fact
he
rather
dislikes
it
but
like
all
the
caresfoots
he
does
not
care
about
parting
with
landed
property
and
though
we
appear
to
be
good
friends
he
hates
me
too
much
ever
to
consent
under
ordinary
circumstances
to
sell
it
to
me
it
is
to
you
i
look
to
overcome
that
how
are
a
woman
and
you
ask
me
how
you
should
get
the
blind
side
of
a
man
do
not
in
the
least
understand
philip
smiled
incredulously
i
suppose
i
must
explain
if
ever
you
take
the
trouble
to
look
at
yourself
in
the
glass
you
will
probably
see
that
nature
has
been
very
kind
to
you
in
the
matter
of
good
looks
nor
are
you
by
any
means
deficient
in
brains
your
cousin
george
is
very
fond
of
a
pretty
woman
and
to
be
plain
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
make
use
of
your
advantages
to
get
him
under
your
thumb
and
persuade
him
into
selling
the
father
how
can
you
ejaculated
angela
in
an
agony
of
shame
idiot
i
want
you
to
marry
him
i
only
want
you
to
make
a
fool
of
him
surely
being
of
the
sex
you
are
you
find
an
uncongenial
blushes
had
given
away
to
pallor
now
and
she
answered
with
cold
contempt
think
you
quite
understand
what
a
girl
least
what
i
feel
for
i
know
no
other
girls
perhaps
it
would
be
useless
for
me
to
try
to
explain
i
had
rather
go
blind
than
use
my
eyes
for
such
a
shameful
said
her
father
with
as
much
temper
as
he
ever
showed
now
me
tell
you
that
you
are
a
silly
fool
you
are
more
you
are
an
encumbrance
your
birth
he
added
bitterly
me
of
your
mother
and
the
fact
of
your
being
a
girl
deprived
our
branch
of
the
family
of
their
rights
now
that
you
have
grown
up
you
prefer
to
gratify
your
whims
rather
than
help
me
to
realize
the
object
of
my
life
by
a
simple
course
of
action
that
could
do
no
one
any
harm
i
never
asked
you
to
commit
yourself
in
any
way
well
well
it
is
what
i
must
expect
we
have
not
seen
much
of
each
other
heretofore
and
perhaps
the
less
we
meet
in
the
future
the
have
no
right
to
talk
to
me
so
she
answered
with
flashing
eyes
i
am
your
daughter
and
it
is
cowardly
to
reproach
me
with
my
birth
my
sex
and
my
dependence
am
i
responsible
for
any
of
these
things
but
i
will
not
burden
you
long
and
as
to
what
you
wanted
me
to
do
and
think
such
a
little
of
i
ask
you
is
it
what
my
poor
mother
would
have
wished
her
here
philip
abruptly
rose
and
left
the
room
and
the
house
is
as
like
her
mother
as
possible
he
mused
as
soon
as
he
was
clear
of
the
house
might
have
been
hilda
herself
only
she
is
twice
as
beautiful
as
hilda
was
i
shall
have
another
bad
night
after
this
i
know
i
shall
i
must
get
rid
of
that
girl
somehow
i
can
not
bear
her
about
me
she
is
a
daily
reminder
of
things
i
dare
not
remember
and
whenever
she
stares
at
me
with
those
great
eyes
of
hers
i
feel
as
though
she
were
looking
through
me
i
wonder
if
she
knows
the
story
of
maria
lee
and
then
dismissing
or
trying
to
dismiss
the
matter
from
his
mind
he
took
his
way
across
the
fields
to
isleworth
hall
a
large
white
brick
mansion
in
the
queen
anne
style
about
two
miles
distant
from
the
abbey
and
on
arrival
asked
for
his
cousin
george
and
was
at
once
shown
into
that
presence
years
had
told
upon
george
more
than
they
had
upon
philip
and
though
there
were
no
touches
of
grey
in
the
flaming
red
of
his
hair
the
bloodshot
eyes
and
the
puckered
crowsfeet
beneath
them
to
say
nothing
of
the
slight
but
constant
trembling
of
the
hand
all
showed
that
he
was
a
man
well
on
in
and
who
had
lived
every
day
of
it
time
too
had
made
the
face
more
intensely
unpleasant
and
than
ever
such
caresfoot
characteristics
as
it
possessed
were
year
by
year
giving
place
in
an
increasingly
greater
degree
to
the
strain
introduced
by
the
mother
in
short
george
caresfoot
did
not
even
look
a
gentleman
whereas
philip
certainly
did
seem
very
well
george
i
am
afraid
that
your
travels
have
not
agreed
with
dear
philip
answered
his
cousin
in
a
languid
and
affected
voice
you
had
lived
the
life
that
i
have
for
the
last
twenty
years
you
would
look
a
little
knocked
up
i
have
had
some
very
good
times
but
the
fact
is
that
i
have
been
too
prodigal
of
my
strength
not
thought
enough
about
the
future
it
is
a
great
mistake
and
one
of
the
worst
results
is
that
i
am
utterly
of
everything
even
belle
is
played
out
for
me
i
seen
a
woman
i
care
twopence
about
for
ten
you
should
sell
this
place
and
take
a
house
in
town
it
would
suit
you
much
can
do
that
without
selling
the
place
i
intend
to
sell
the
fact
nothing
would
induce
me
to
do
so
some
day
i
may
marry
and
want
to
transmit
it
to
some
future
caresfoot
but
i
confess
i
mean
to
do
that
just
yet
marry
when
you
want
a
nurse
but
never
before
my
maxim
marriage
is
an
excellent
institution
for
parsons
and
fools
the
two
classes
that
providence
has
created
to
populate
the
world
but
a
wise
man
should
as
soon
think
of
walking
into
a
take
your
own
case
for
instance
my
dear
philip
look
what
marriage
led
any
rate
answered
his
cousin
bitterly
led
to
your
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
have
such
a
respect
for
the
institution
in
the
abstract
it
has
been
my
personal
benefactor
and
i
worship
it
a
distance
by
the
way
talking
of
marriage
reminds
me
of
its
legitimate
fruits
bellamy
tells
me
that
your
daughter
angela
if
i
had
a
daughter
i
should
call
her
diabola
it
is
more
appropriate
for
a
woman
has
grown
uncommonly
handsome
bring
her
to
see
me
i
adore
beauty
in
all
its
forms
especially
its
female
form
is
she
really
so
handsome
am
no
judge
but
you
will
soon
have
an
opportunity
of
forming
an
is
i
hope
so
i
propose
coming
with
angela
to
make
a
formal
call
on
you
tell
my
fair
cousin
that
i
shall
be
certain
to
be
in
and
be
prepared
metaphorically
to
fall
at
the
feet
of
so
much
loveliness
by
the
way
that
reminds
me
you
have
heard
of
or
rather
good
fortune
i
suppose
why
he
is
now
sir
john
bellamy
how
is
that
remember
the
six
months
back
yes
i
was
actually
badgered
by
bellamy
into
promising
to
vote
much
against
my
personal
well
just
at
the
time
old
prescott
died
you
may
remember
that
showers
the
member
of
the
government
was
unseated
on
petition
from
some
borough
or
other
and
came
down
here
to
get
but
he
had
sir
percy
vivyan
against
him
and
as
i
know
to
my
cost
this
benighted
country
is
not
fond
of
those
who
preach
the
gospel
of
progress
bellamy
who
is
a
stout
radical
as
you
i
fancy
because
there
is
more
to
be
got
out
of
that
side
of
the
job
as
agent
but
three
days
before
it
became
quite
clear
that
his
cause
cabinet
minister
or
not
was
hopeless
then
it
was
that
beg
her
pardon
came
to
the
fore
just
as
showers
was
thinking
of
withdrawing
she
demanded
a
private
interview
with
him
next
day
she
posted
off
to
old
sir
percy
who
is
a
perfect
fool
of
the
chivalrous
school
and
was
desperately
fond
of
her
and
that
evening
sir
percy
withdraws
on
the
plea
of
or
some
such
rubbish
and
showers
walks
over
within
three
months
bellamy
becomes
sir
john
bellamy
nominally
for
his
services
as
of
roxham
and
i
hear
that
old
sir
percy
is
now
perfectly
rampant
and
goes
about
cursing
her
ladyship
up
hill
and
down
dale
and
declaring
that
he
has
been
shockingly
how
our
mutual
friend
worked
the
ropes
is
more
than
i
can
tell
you
but
she
did
work
them
and
to
some
is
an
uncommonly
handsome
yes
right
there
she
is
but
let
us
stroll
out
a
little
it
is
a
fine
evening
for
the
of
april
will
be
the
of
may
so
it
will
a
day
neither
of
us
are
likely
to
philip
winced
at
the
allusion
but
said
nothing
the
way
george
went
on
am
expecting
a
visitor
my
ward
young
arthur
heigham
who
is
just
back
from
india
he
will
be
five
in
a
few
days
when
he
comes
of
age
and
is
coming
down
to
settle
up
the
fact
is
that
ten
thousand
of
his
money
is
on
the
jotley
property
and
both
bellamy
and
myself
are
anxious
that
it
should
stop
there
for
the
present
as
if
the
mortgage
were
called
in
it
might
be
he
well
off
about
a
thousand
a
year
comes
of
an
old
family
too
bellamy
and
i
knew
his
father
captain
heigham
slightly
when
we
were
in
business
his
wife
by
the
way
was
a
distant
cousin
of
ours
they
are
both
dead
now
the
captain
was
wiped
out
at
inkerman
and
for
some
unknown
reason
left
me
the
young
sole
guardian
and
joint
trustee
with
a
london
lawyer
a
certain
borley
i
have
never
seen
him
ward
i
has
always
been
at
eton
or
cambridge
or
in
india
or
here
philip
began
to
manifest
signs
of
considerable
uneasiness
the
cause
of
which
was
sufficiently
apparent
for
whilst
they
were
talking
a
very
large
and
animal
of
the
order
had
emerged
from
the
house
and
was
following
him
up
and
down
growling
in
a
low
and
ominous
undertone
its
nose
being
the
while
glued
to
his
calves
as
they
alternately
presented
themselves
in
his
line
of
vision
you
mind
calling
off
this
animal
george
he
said
at
length
does
not
look
snarleyow
mind
him
he
never
bites
unless
you
philip
instinctively
quickened
his
pace
he
a
beauty
a
pure
bred
thibet
and
i
will
back
him
to
fight
against
any
animal
of
his
own
weight
he
killed
two
dogs
in
one
morning
the
other
day
and
pulled
down
a
in
the
evening
you
should
have
heard
her
at
that
moment
fortunately
for
calves
which
were
beginning
to
tingle
with
an
unwholesome
excitement
attention
was
diverted
by
the
approach
of
a
and
he
left
to
enjoy
the
amusement
of
snapping
and
barking
at
the
horse
the
cart
pulled
up
at
the
door
and
out
of
it
emerged
a
tall
and
extremely
looking
young
fellow
followed
by
a
very
large
red
caresfoot
i
believe
said
the
young
gentleman
to
george
taking
off
his
hat
heigham
at
your
service
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
my
cousin
philip
chapter
xviii
must
apologise
for
having
brought
aleck
my
dog
you
know
with
me
began
arthur
heigham
the
fact
was
that
at
the
very
last
moment
the
man
i
was
going
to
leave
him
with
had
to
go
away
and
i
had
no
time
to
find
another
place
before
the
train
left
i
thought
that
if
you
objected
to
dogs
he
could
easily
be
sent
somewhere
into
the
village
he
is
very
though
appearances
are
against
he
will
be
all
right
i
daresay
said
george
rather
sulkily
for
with
the
exception
of
snarleyow
in
whose
fiendish
temper
he
found
something
refreshing
and
congenial
he
liked
no
dogs
you
must
be
careful
or
snarleyow
dog
will
give
him
a
hammering
here
good
dog
good
dog
and
he
attempted
to
pat
aleck
on
the
head
but
the
animal
growled
savagely
and
avoided
him
never
knew
him
do
that
before
ejaculated
arthur
in
confusion
and
heartily
wishing
aleck
somewhere
else
suppose
he
has
taken
a
dislike
to
you
dogs
do
sometimes
you
next
second
it
struck
him
that
this
was
one
of
those
things
that
had
better
have
been
left
unsaid
and
he
grew
more
uncomfortable
than
ever
but
at
this
very
moment
the
situation
was
rendered
intensely
lively
by
the
approach
of
the
redoubtable
snarleyow
himself
who
having
snapped
at
the
heels
all
the
way
to
the
stables
had
on
his
return
to
the
front
of
the
house
spotted
aleck
from
afar
he
was
now
advancing
on
tiptoe
in
full
order
of
battle
his
teeth
gleaming
and
his
coat
and
tail
standing
out
like
an
angry
arthur
already
sufficiently
put
out
about
the
dog
question
thought
it
best
to
take
no
notice
and
even
when
he
distinctly
heard
george
quietly
on
his
dog
as
he
passed
him
he
contented
himself
with
giving
aleck
a
kick
by
way
of
a
warning
to
behave
himself
and
entered
into
some
desultory
conversation
with
philip
but
presently
a
series
of
growls
behind
him
announced
that
an
encounter
was
imminent
looking
round
he
perceived
that
snarleyow
was
standing
over
the
of
which
he
was
more
than
twice
the
size
and
holding
on
to
the
skin
of
his
neck
with
his
long
teeth
whilst
george
was
looking
on
with
scarcely
suppressed
amusement
think
caresfoot
that
you
had
better
call
your
dog
off
said
arthur
is
a
peaceable
animal
but
he
is
an
awkward
customer
when
he
does
better
let
them
settle
it
they
will
be
much
better
friends
afterwards
hold
him
thus
encouraged
the
big
dog
seized
the
other
and
fairly
lifted
him
off
the
ground
shaking
him
proceeding
that
had
the
effect
of
thoroughly
rousing
temper
and
then
began
a
most
homeric
combat
at
first
the
was
dreadfully
mauled
his
size
weight
and
length
of
leg
and
jaw
to
say
nothing
of
the
thick
coat
by
which
he
was
protected
all
telling
against
him
but
he
took
his
punishment
very
quietly
never
so
much
as
uttering
a
growl
in
strange
contrast
to
the
big
vociferous
style
of
doing
business
and
at
last
patience
was
rewarded
by
his
finding
its
way
into
powerful
jaw
and
remaining
there
till
attentions
to
the
back
of
his
neck
forced
him
to
shift
his
hold
from
that
time
forward
the
had
to
fight
on
three
legs
which
he
found
demoralizing
but
still
he
had
the
advantage
and
it
was
not
until
any
other
dog
of
size
would
have
retreated
half
killed
that
the
superior
courage
and
stamina
began
to
tell
quite
heedless
of
his
injuries
and
the
blood
that
poured
into
his
eyes
he
slowly
but
surely
drove
the
great
who
by
this
time
would
have
been
glad
to
stop
back
into
an
angle
of
the
wall
and
then
suddenly
pinned
him
by
the
throat
down
went
snarleyow
on
the
top
of
the
and
rolled
right
over
him
but
when
he
staggered
to
his
legs
again
his
throat
was
still
in
its
cruel
grip
your
dog
off
shouted
george
seeing
that
affairs
had
taken
a
turn
he
very
little
expected
fear
that
is
impossible
replied
arthur
politely
but
looking
anything
but
polite
you
get
it
off
i
will
shoot
will
do
nothing
of
the
sort
caresfoot
you
set
the
dog
on
and
you
must
take
the
consequences
ah
the
affair
is
as
he
spoke
the
choking
snarleyow
whose
black
tongue
was
protruding
from
his
jaws
gave
one
last
convulsive
struggle
and
ceased
to
breathe
satisfied
with
this
result
aleck
let
go
and
having
sniffed
contemptuously
at
his
dead
antagonist
returned
to
his
side
and
sitting
quietly
down
began
to
lick
such
of
his
numerous
wounds
as
he
could
reach
george
when
he
realized
that
his
favourite
was
dead
turned
upon
his
guest
in
a
perfect
fury
his
face
looked
like
a
but
arthur
acting
with
wonderful
for
so
young
a
man
stopped
him
caresfoot
before
you
say
anything
that
you
may
regret
that
neither
i
nor
my
dog
is
to
blame
for
what
has
happened
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
that
your
dog
should
have
been
killed
but
it
is
your
own
fault
i
am
afraid
however
that
after
what
has
happened
i
shall
be
as
unwelcome
here
as
aleck
so
if
you
will
kindly
order
the
cart
for
me
again
i
will
move
on
our
business
can
no
doubt
be
finished
off
by
george
made
no
reply
it
was
evident
that
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
speak
but
turning
sullenly
on
his
heel
walked
towards
the
house
a
bit
heigham
said
philip
who
had
been
watching
the
whole
scene
with
secret
delight
are
perfectly
in
the
right
i
will
go
and
try
to
bring
my
cousin
to
his
senses
i
am
very
thankful
to
your
dog
for
killing
that
accursed
he
was
away
for
about
ten
minutes
during
which
arthur
took
aleck
to
a
fountain
there
was
in
the
centre
of
a
grass
plot
in
front
of
the
house
and
washed
his
many
wounds
none
of
which
however
were
thanks
to
the
looseness
of
his
hide
very
serious
just
as
he
had
finished
that
operation
a
gardener
arrived
with
a
wheelbarrow
to
fetch
away
the
deceased
snarleyow
sir
he
said
to
arthur
am
glad
to
have
the
job
of
tucking
up
this
here
brute
he
bit
my
missus
last
week
and
killed
a
whole
clutch
of
early
ducks
i
seed
the
row
through
the
bushes
that
dog
of
yours
sir
he
did
fight
in
proper
style
i
should
like
to
have
a
dog
like
just
then
the
of
philip
put
a
stop
to
the
conversation
drawing
arthur
aside
he
told
him
that
george
begged
to
apologise
for
what
had
occurred
and
hoped
that
he
would
not
think
of
going
away
added
philip
with
a
little
laugh
pretend
that
he
has
taken
a
fancy
to
you
and
if
i
were
you
i
should
cut
my
visit
is
exactly
my
view
of
the
case
i
will
leave
philip
made
no
further
remarks
for
a
few
moments
he
was
evidently
thinking
presently
he
said
see
you
have
a
amongst
your
things
if
you
find
the
time
hang
heavy
on
your
hands
or
wish
to
keep
out
of
the
way
you
had
better
come
over
to
bratham
lake
and
fish
there
are
some
very
large
carp
and
perch
there
and
pike
too
for
the
matter
of
that
but
they
are
out
of
arthur
thanked
him
and
said
that
he
should
probably
come
and
having
received
instructions
as
to
the
road
they
parted
arthur
to
go
and
shut
up
aleck
in
an
outhouse
pointed
out
to
him
by
his
friend
the
gardener
and
thence
to
dress
for
a
dinner
that
he
looked
forward
to
with
dread
and
philip
to
make
his
way
home
as
he
passed
up
through
the
little
at
the
abbey
house
he
came
across
his
daughter
picking
the
blight
from
her
shooting
he
said
am
sorry
if
i
offended
your
prejudices
this
afternoon
let
us
say
anything
more
about
it
but
i
want
you
to
come
and
pay
a
formal
call
with
me
at
isleworth
it
will
only
be
civil
that
you
should
do
never
paid
a
call
in
my
life
she
answered
doubtfully
i
want
to
call
on
my
cousin
very
well
and
he
began
to
move
on
she
stopped
him
will
go
if
you
three
then
oh
by
the
way
be
surprised
if
you
see
a
young
gentleman
fishing
here
angela
reflected
to
herself
that
she
had
never
yet
seen
a
young
gentleman
to
speak
to
in
her
life
and
then
asked
with
undisguised
interest
who
he
was
he
is
a
sort
of
connection
of
your
own
through
the
prestons
who
are
cousins
of
ours
if
any
of
them
are
left
his
mother
was
a
preston
and
his
name
is
arthur
preston
heigham
george
told
me
something
about
him
just
now
and
on
thinking
it
over
i
remember
the
whole
story
he
is
an
orphan
and
is
he
like
asked
angela
ingenuously
i
know
rather
tall
i
gentlemanly
fellow
it
really
is
a
relief
to
speak
to
a
gentleman
again
there
has
been
a
nice
disturbance
at
isleworth
and
then
he
told
his
daughter
the
history
of
the
great
dog
fight
should
think
heigham
was
perfectly
in
the
right
and
i
should
like
to
see
his
dog
was
her
comment
on
the
occurrence
as
arthur
dressed
himself
for
dinner
that
evening
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
disliked
his
host
more
than
any
man
he
ever
saw
and
to
say
the
truth
he
descended
into
the
with
considerable
misgivings
just
as
he
entered
the
opposite
door
opened
and
sir
john
bellamy
was
announced
on
seeing
him
george
emerged
from
the
sulky
silence
into
which
he
was
plunged
and
advanced
to
meet
him
bellamy
i
must
congratulate
you
upon
your
accession
to
you
caresfoot
thank
you
replied
bellamy
who
with
the
exception
that
he
had
grown
a
size
larger
and
boasted
a
bald
patch
on
the
top
of
his
head
that
gave
him
something
of
the
appearance
of
a
jolly
little
monk
looked
very
much
the
same
as
when
we
last
saw
him
as
a
newly
married
man
kind
providence
he
went
on
rubbing
his
dry
hands
and
glancing
nervously
under
the
chairs
put
this
honour
into
my
providence
in
petticoats
you
mean
broke
in
george
my
dear
caresfoot
but
i
do
not
see
him
is
it
possible
that
he
is
lurking
yonder
behind
the
sofa
on
earth
do
you
mean
mean
that
exceedingly
fine
dog
of
yours
snarleyow
snarleyow
where
are
you
excuse
me
for
taking
precautions
but
last
time
he
put
his
head
under
my
chair
and
bit
me
severely
as
i
dare
say
you
arthur
groaned
at
hearing
the
subject
thus
brought
forward
dog
killed
snarleyow
this
afternoon
said
george
in
a
savage
voice
at
this
intelligence
sir
face
became
wreathed
in
smiles
am
deeply
mean
hear
it
poor
snarleyow
he
was
a
charming
dog
and
to
think
that
such
a
fate
should
have
overtaken
him
when
it
was
only
last
week
that
he
did
the
same
kind
office
for
spaniel
poor
snarleyow
you
should
really
have
him
stuffed
but
my
dear
caresfoot
you
have
not
yet
introduced
me
to
the
hero
of
the
evening
heigham
heigham
i
am
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
and
he
shook
hands
with
arthur
with
gentle
enthusiasm
as
though
he
were
the
last
scion
of
a
race
that
he
had
known
and
loved
for
generations
presently
dinner
was
announced
and
the
three
sat
down
at
a
small
round
table
in
the
centre
of
the
big
on
which
was
placed
a
shaded
lamp
it
was
not
a
cheerful
dinner
george
having
said
grace
relapsed
into
moody
silence
eating
and
drinking
with
gusto
but
in
moderation
and
savouring
every
sup
of
wine
and
morsel
of
food
as
though
he
regretted
its
departure
he
was
not
free
from
gluttony
but
he
was
a
judicious
glutton
for
his
part
arthur
found
a
certain
fascination
in
watching
his
red
head
as
he
bobbed
up
and
down
opposite
to
him
and
speculating
on
the
thickness
of
each
individual
hair
that
contributed
to
give
it
such
a
spiky
effect
what
had
his
mother
been
like
he
wondered
that
she
had
started
him
in
life
with
such
an
entirely
detestable
countenance
meanwhile
he
was
replying
in
monosyllables
to
sir
gentle
babblings
till
at
last
even
that
flow
of
conversation
ran
dry
and
arthur
was
left
free
to
contemplate
the
head
in
solemn
silence
as
soon
as
the
cloth
had
been
cleared
away
george
suggested
that
they
had
better
get
to
work
arthur
assented
and
sir
john
smiling
with
much
sweetness
remarked
profoundly
that
business
was
one
of
the
ills
of
life
and
must
be
attended
to
any
rate
it
is
an
ill
that
has
agreed
uncommonly
well
with
you
growled
george
as
rising
from
the
table
he
went
to
a
solid
iron
safe
that
stood
in
the
corner
of
the
room
and
unlocking
it
with
a
small
key
that
he
took
from
his
pocket
extracted
a
bundle
of
documents
is
an
excellent
of
yours
caresfoot
said
sir
john
carelessly
that
lock
would
not
be
very
easy
to
pick
it
is
made
on
my
own
you
find
that
small
parcels
such
as
private
letters
are
apt
to
get
lost
in
it
it
is
so
no
there
is
a
separate
compartment
for
them
now
and
then
with
the
able
and
benign
assistance
of
sir
john
he
proceeded
to
utterly
confuse
and
mystify
arthur
till
stocks
consols
and
mortgages
were
all
whirling
in
his
bewildered
brain
having
satisfactorily
reduced
him
to
this
condition
he
suddenly
sprang
upon
him
the
proposal
he
had
in
view
with
reference
to
the
jotley
mortgage
pointing
out
to
him
that
it
was
an
excellent
investment
and
strongly
advising
him
a
friend
to
leave
the
money
upon
the
land
arthur
hesitated
a
little
more
from
natural
caution
than
anything
he
could
urge
to
the
contrary
and
george
noticing
it
said
is
only
right
that
before
you
come
to
any
decision
you
should
see
the
map
of
the
estate
and
a
copy
of
the
deed
i
have
both
in
the
next
room
if
you
care
to
come
and
look
at
arthur
assented
and
they
went
off
together
sir
john
whose
eyes
appeared
to
be
a
little
heavy
under
the
influence
of
the
port
presuming
that
he
was
not
wanted
but
no
sooner
had
the
door
closed
than
the
worthy
knight
proved
himself
very
indeed
he
commenced
a
singular
course
of
action
advancing
on
tiptoe
to
the
safe
in
the
corner
of
the
room
he
closely
inspected
it
through
his
eyeglass
then
he
cautiously
tried
the
lid
of
an
artfully
contrived
subdivision
he
muttered
half
aloud
where
they
are
i
wish
i
had
ten
next
he
returned
swiftly
to
the
table
and
taking
a
piece
of
the
soft
bread
which
he
was
eating
instead
of
biscuit
with
his
wine
he
rapidly
kneaded
it
into
dough
and
going
to
the
safe
divided
the
material
into
two
portions
one
portion
he
carefully
pressed
upon
the
keyhole
of
the
subdivision
and
then
extracting
the
key
of
the
safe
itself
took
a
very
fair
impress
of
its
wards
on
the
other
this
done
he
carefully
put
the
pieces
of
dough
in
his
in
such
a
way
that
they
were
not
likely
to
be
crushed
and
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
returned
to
his
chair
helped
himself
to
a
glass
of
port
and
dozed
off
bellamy
gone
to
sleep
wake
up
man
we
have
settled
this
business
about
the
mortgage
will
you
write
to
borley
and
convey
decision
and
will
do
the
same
on
your
own
i
will
write
caresfoot
and
now
i
think
that
i
must
be
off
her
ladyship
does
not
like
having
to
sit
up
for
george
laughed
in
a
peculiarly
insulting
way
think
she
would
care
much
bellamy
if
you
stayed
away
all
night
but
look
here
tell
her
i
want
to
see
her
sir
john
bit
his
knightly
lip
but
answered
smiling
that
he
would
remember
and
begging
george
not
to
ring
as
his
trap
was
at
the
door
and
the
servant
waiting
he
bade
an
affectionate
to
arthur
to
whom
he
expressed
a
hope
that
they
would
soon
meet
again
and
let
himself
out
of
the
room
but
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
he
went
through
another
performance
exceedingly
inappropriate
in
a
knight
turning
round
his
smug
face
red
with
anger
he
pirouetted
on
his
toes
and
shook
his
fist
violently
in
the
direction
of
the
door
scoundrel
he
said
between
his
teeth
have
made
a
fool
of
me
for
twenty
years
and
i
have
been
obliged
to
grin
and
bear
it
but
i
will
be
even
with
you
yet
and
her
too
more
especially
so
soon
as
sir
john
had
left
arthur
told
his
host
that
if
the
morning
was
fine
he
proposed
to
go
and
fish
in
bratham
lake
and
that
he
also
proposed
to
take
his
departure
by
the
last
train
on
the
following
evening
to
these
propositions
george
offered
no
indeed
they
were
distinctly
agreeable
to
him
as
lessening
the
time
he
would
be
forced
to
spend
in
the
society
of
a
guest
he
cordially
detested
for
such
was
the
feeling
that
he
had
conceived
towards
arthur
then
they
parted
for
the
night
but
before
he
left
the
room
george
went
to
lock
up
the
safe
that
was
still
open
in
the
corner
struck
by
some
thought
he
unlocked
the
separate
compartment
with
a
key
that
hung
on
his
and
extracted
therefrom
a
thick
and
neatly
folded
packet
of
letters
drawing
out
one
or
two
he
glanced
through
them
and
replaced
them
lady
anne
lady
anne
he
said
to
himself
as
he
closed
the
case
are
up
in
the
world
now
and
you
aspire
to
rule
the
county
society
and
have
both
the
wealth
and
the
wit
to
do
it
but
you
must
not
kick
over
the
traces
or
i
shall
be
forced
to
suppress
you
lady
anne
though
you
are
the
wife
of
a
brummagem
knight
and
i
think
that
it
is
time
you
had
a
little
reminder
you
are
growing
a
touch
too
chapter
xix
sleep
was
oppressed
that
night
by
horrible
nightmares
of
fighting
dogs
whereof
the
largest
and
most
ferocious
was
fitted
with
red
head
the
effect
of
which
screwed
without
any
eye
to
the
fitness
of
things
to
the
body
of
the
deceased
snarleyow
struck
him
as
peculiarly
disagreeable
he
himself
was
armed
with
a
gun
and
whilst
he
was
still
arguing
with
sir
john
bellamy
the
nice
point
whether
should
he
execute
that
particular
animal
as
he
felt
a
carnal
longing
to
do
it
would
be
manslaughter
or
dogslaughter
he
found
himself
wide
awake
it
was
very
early
in
the
morning
of
the
of
may
and
contrary
to
the
usual
experience
of
the
inhabitants
of
these
islands
the
sky
gave
promise
of
a
particularly
fine
day
just
the
day
for
fishing
he
did
not
feel
sleepy
and
had
he
done
so
he
had
had
enough
of
his
doggy
dreams
so
he
got
up
dressed
and
taking
his
let
himself
out
of
the
house
as
he
had
been
instructed
to
do
on
the
previous
evening
and
releasing
aleck
from
his
outhouse
proceeded
towards
bratham
lake
and
about
this
time
angela
woke
up
too
for
she
always
rose
early
and
ran
to
the
window
to
see
what
sort
of
a
day
she
had
got
for
her
birthday
seeing
it
to
be
so
fine
she
threw
open
the
old
lattice
at
which
her
pet
raven
jack
was
already
tapping
to
be
admitted
and
let
the
sweet
air
play
upon
her
face
and
neck
and
thought
what
a
wonderful
thing
it
was
to
be
twenty
years
old
and
then
kneeling
by
the
window
she
said
her
prayers
after
her
own
fashion
thanking
god
who
had
spared
her
to
see
this
day
and
praying
him
to
show
her
what
to
do
with
her
life
and
if
it
was
his
will
to
make
it
a
little
less
lonely
then
she
rose
and
dressed
herself
feeling
that
now
that
she
had
done
with
her
teens
she
was
in
every
respect
a
woman
indeed
quite
old
and
in
honour
of
the
event
she
chose
out
of
her
scanty
store
of
dresses
all
of
them
made
by
pigott
and
herself
her
very
prettiest
the
one
she
had
had
for
sunday
wear
last
summer
a
robe
of
white
stuff
with
soft
little
frills
round
the
neck
and
wrists
next
she
put
on
a
pair
of
stout
boots
calculated
to
keep
out
the
morning
dew
and
started
off
now
all
this
had
taken
a
good
time
nearly
an
hour
perhaps
for
being
her
birthday
and
there
having
been
some
mention
of
a
young
gentleman
who
might
possibly
come
to
fish
she
had
plaited
up
her
shining
hair
with
extra
care
a
very
laborious
business
when
your
hair
hangs
down
to
your
knees
meanwhile
our
other
early
riser
arthur
had
made
his
way
first
to
the
foot
of
the
lake
and
then
along
the
little
path
that
skirted
its
area
till
he
came
to
caresfoot
staff
having
sufficiently
admired
that
majestic
oak
for
he
was
a
great
lover
of
timber
he
proceeded
to
investigate
the
surrounding
water
with
the
eye
of
a
true
fisherman
a
few
yards
further
up
there
jutted
into
the
water
that
fragment
of
wall
on
which
stood
the
post
now
quite
rotten
to
which
angela
had
bound
herself
on
the
day
of
the
great
storm
at
his
feet
too
the
foundations
of
another
wall
ran
out
for
some
distance
into
the
lake
being
doubtless
the
underpinning
of
an
ancient
boathouse
but
this
did
not
rise
out
of
the
water
but
stopped
within
six
inches
of
the
surface
between
these
two
walls
lay
a
very
deep
pool
the
place
for
a
heavy
fish
reflected
arthur
and
even
as
he
thought
it
he
saw
a
carp
rise
nearly
to
the
surface
in
order
to
clear
the
obstruction
of
the
wall
and
sink
silently
into
the
depths
retiring
carefully
to
one
of
two
quaintly
carven
stone
blocks
placed
at
the
foot
of
the
on
which
doubtless
many
a
monk
had
sat
in
meditation
he
set
himself
to
get
his
together
presently
however
struck
by
the
beauty
of
the
spot
and
its
quiet
only
broken
by
the
songs
of
many
nesting
birds
he
stopped
a
while
to
look
around
him
above
his
head
the
branches
of
a
great
oak
now
clothing
themselves
with
the
most
vivid
green
formed
a
roof
beneath
the
shade
of
which
grew
the
softest
moss
starred
here
and
there
with
primroses
and
violets
outside
the
circle
of
its
shadow
the
brushwood
of
mingled
hazel
and
rose
thick
and
high
the
little
spot
as
with
a
wall
except
where
its
depths
were
pierced
by
the
passage
of
a
long
green
lane
of
limes
that
unlike
the
shrubberies
appeared
to
be
kept
in
careful
order
and
of
which
the
arching
boughs
formed
a
perfect
leafy
tunnel
before
him
lay
the
lake
where
the
long
morning
lights
quivered
and
danced
as
its
calm
was
now
and
again
ruffled
by
a
gentle
breeze
the
whole
scene
had
a
lovely
and
peaceful
look
and
gazing
on
it
arthur
fell
into
a
reverie
sitting
thus
dreamily
his
face
looked
at
its
best
its
expression
of
gentle
thoughtfulness
giving
it
an
attraction
beyond
what
it
was
entitled
to
judged
purely
from
a
point
of
view
it
was
an
intellectual
face
a
face
that
gave
signs
of
great
mental
possibilities
but
for
all
that
a
little
weak
about
the
mouth
the
brow
indicated
some
degree
of
power
and
the
mouth
and
eyes
no
small
capacities
for
affection
and
all
sorts
of
human
sympathy
and
kindness
these
last
in
varying
lights
could
change
as
often
as
the
english
climate
their
groundwork
however
was
blue
and
they
were
honest
and
bonny
in
short
a
man
in
looking
at
arthur
heigham
at
the
age
of
would
have
reflected
that
even
among
english
gentlemen
he
was
remarkable
for
his
appearance
and
a
one
would
like
to
know
a
girl
would
have
dubbed
him
and
a
most
women
do
not
really
understand
the
immense
difference
between
men
until
they
are
getting
on
that
would
have
recognized
in
him
a
young
man
by
no
means
uninteresting
and
one
who
might
according
to
the
circumstances
of
his
life
develop
into
anything
in
particular
presently
drawn
by
some
unguessed
attraction
arthur
took
his
eyes
off
an
industrious
who
was
building
a
nest
in
a
hurried
way
as
though
she
were
not
quite
sure
of
his
intentions
and
perceived
a
large
raven
standing
on
one
leg
on
the
grass
about
three
yards
from
him
and
peering
at
him
comically
out
of
one
eye
this
was
odd
but
his
glance
did
not
stop
at
the
raven
for
a
yard
or
two
beyond
it
he
caught
sight
of
a
white
skirt
and
his
eyes
travelling
upwards
saw
first
a
rounded
waist
and
then
a
bust
and
pair
of
shoulders
such
as
few
women
can
boast
and
at
last
another
pair
of
eyes
and
he
then
and
there
fell
utterly
and
irretrievably
in
love
heavens
he
said
fellow
he
did
not
mean
to
say
it
it
was
wrung
from
the
depths
of
his
heavens
how
lovely
she
is
let
the
reader
imagine
the
dreadful
confusion
produced
in
that
other
pair
of
eyes
at
the
open
expression
of
such
a
sentiment
and
the
vivid
blush
that
stained
the
fair
face
in
which
they
were
set
if
he
can
but
somehow
they
did
not
grow
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
the
most
sternly
repressive
young
lady
to
grow
angry
at
a
compliment
which
however
marked
was
so
evidently
genuine
and
unpremeditated
in
another
moment
arthur
bethought
him
of
what
he
had
said
and
it
was
his
turn
to
blush
he
recovered
himself
pretty
well
however
rising
from
his
stone
seat
he
took
off
his
hat
and
said
humbly
beg
your
pardon
but
you
startled
me
so
and
really
for
a
moment
i
thought
that
you
were
the
spirit
of
the
place
or
he
added
gracefully
pointing
to
a
branch
of
hawthorn
bloom
she
held
in
her
hand
original
queen
of
the
angela
blushed
again
the
compliment
was
only
implied
this
time
she
had
therefore
no
possible
pretext
for
getting
angry
for
a
moment
she
dropped
the
sweet
eyes
that
looked
as
though
they
were
fresh
from
reading
the
truths
of
heaven
before
his
gaze
of
unmistakable
admiration
and
stood
confused
and
as
she
stood
it
struck
arthur
that
there
was
something
more
than
mere
beauty
of
form
and
feature
about
indescribable
something
a
glory
of
innocence
a
reflection
of
own
light
that
tinged
the
worship
her
loveliness
commanded
with
a
touch
of
reverential
awe
angels
must
look
like
that
he
thought
but
he
had
no
time
to
think
any
more
for
next
moment
she
had
gathered
up
her
courage
in
both
her
hands
and
was
speaking
to
him
in
a
soft
voice
of
which
the
tones
went
ringing
on
through
all
the
changes
of
his
life
father
told
me
that
he
had
asked
you
to
come
and
fish
but
i
did
not
expect
to
meet
you
so
early
fear
that
i
am
disturbing
you
and
she
made
as
though
she
would
be
going
arthur
felt
that
this
was
a
contingency
to
be
prevented
at
all
hazards
are
miss
caresfoot
he
said
hurriedly
you
not
am
angela
i
need
not
ask
your
name
my
father
told
it
me
you
are
arthur
and
do
you
know
that
we
are
cousins
this
was
a
slight
exaggeration
but
he
was
glad
to
advance
any
plea
to
her
confidence
that
occurred
to
him
my
father
said
something
about
our
being
related
i
have
no
relations
except
my
cousin
george
and
i
am
very
glad
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
one
and
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
in
a
winning
way
he
took
it
almost
reverently
can
not
he
said
with
much
sincerity
more
glad
than
i
am
i
too
am
without
relations
till
lately
i
had
my
mother
but
she
died
last
you
very
fond
of
her
she
asked
softly
he
nodded
in
reply
and
feeling
instinctively
that
she
was
on
delicate
ground
angela
pursued
the
conversation
no
further
meanwhile
aleck
had
awoke
from
a
comfortable
sleep
in
which
he
was
indulging
on
the
other
stone
seat
and
coming
forward
sniffed
at
angela
and
wagged
his
tail
in
liberty
that
was
instantly
resented
by
the
big
raven
who
had
now
been
joined
by
another
not
quite
so
large
advancing
boldly
it
pecked
him
sharply
on
the
proceeding
that
caused
master
aleck
to
jump
round
as
quickly
as
his
maimed
condition
would
allow
him
only
to
receive
a
still
harder
peck
from
its
companion
bird
indeed
it
was
not
until
angela
intervened
with
the
bough
of
hawthorn
that
they
would
cease
from
their
attack
are
such
jealous
creatures
she
explained
always
follow
me
about
and
fly
at
every
dog
that
comes
near
me
poor
dog
that
is
the
one
i
suppose
who
killed
snarleyow
my
father
told
me
all
about
it
is
easy
to
see
that
said
arthur
laughing
and
pointing
to
aleck
who
indeed
was
in
lamentable
case
having
one
eye
entirely
closed
a
large
strip
of
plaster
on
his
head
and
all
the
rest
of
his
body
more
or
less
marked
with
bites
is
an
uncommonly
awkward
business
for
me
and
your
cousin
will
not
forgive
it
in
a
hurry
i
fancy
but
it
really
was
not
poor
is
gentle
as
a
lamb
if
only
he
is
let
has
a
very
honest
face
though
his
nose
does
look
as
though
it
were
broken
she
said
and
stooping
down
she
patted
the
dog
i
must
be
going
in
to
breakfast
she
went
on
presently
is
eight
the
sun
always
strikes
that
bough
at
eight
in
spring
and
she
pointed
to
a
dead
limb
half
hidden
by
the
budding
foliage
of
the
oak
must
observe
closely
to
have
noticed
that
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
sun
is
quite
on
it
yet
i
do
not
like
to
lose
my
relations
in
such
a
hurry
he
added
with
a
somewhat
forced
smile
i
am
to
go
away
from
here
this
the
intelligence
was
evidently
very
little
satisfactory
to
angela
nor
did
she
attempt
to
conceal
her
concern
am
very
sorry
to
hear
that
she
said
hoped
you
were
going
to
stay
for
some
so
i
might
have
had
it
not
been
for
that
brute
aleck
but
he
has
put
a
long
sojourn
with
your
cousin
and
the
ghost
of
snarleyow
out
of
the
question
so
i
suppose
i
must
go
by
the
train
at
any
rate
he
added
more
brightly
as
a
thought
struck
him
must
go
from
she
did
not
appear
to
see
the
drift
of
the
last
part
of
his
remark
but
answered
am
going
with
my
father
to
call
at
isleworth
at
three
this
afternoon
so
perhaps
we
shall
meet
again
there
but
now
before
i
go
in
i
will
show
you
a
better
place
than
this
to
fish
a
little
higher
up
where
jakes
our
gardener
always
sets
his
arthur
assented
as
he
would
have
been
glad
to
assent
to
anything
likely
to
prolong
the
interview
and
they
walked
off
slowly
together
talking
as
cheerfully
as
a
sense
that
the
conversation
must
soon
come
to
an
end
would
allow
the
spot
was
reached
all
too
soon
and
angela
with
evident
reluctance
for
she
was
not
accustomed
to
conceal
her
feelings
said
that
she
must
now
go
must
you
go
so
soon
to
tell
you
the
truth
is
my
am
twenty
i
know
that
pigott
my
old
nurse
means
to
give
me
a
little
present
at
breakfast
and
she
will
be
dreadfully
disappointed
if
i
am
late
she
has
been
thinking
a
great
deal
about
it
you
i
wish
you
many
very
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
a
little
i
also
offer
you
a
present
a
very
worthless
one
i
fear
can
stammered
angela
when
he
cut
her
short
be
afraid
it
is
nothing
tangible
though
it
is
something
that
you
may
not
think
worth
do
you
mean
she
said
bluntly
for
her
interest
was
aroused
be
angry
my
present
is
only
the
offer
of
myself
as
your
sincere
she
blushed
vividly
as
she
answered
are
very
kind
i
have
never
had
but
one
fraser
but
if
you
think
you
can
like
me
enough
it
will
make
me
very
happy
to
be
your
friend
and
in
another
second
she
was
gone
with
her
ravens
flying
after
her
to
receive
her
present
and
a
jobation
from
pigott
for
being
late
and
to
eat
her
breakfast
with
such
appetite
as
an
entirely
new
set
of
sensations
can
give
in
the
garden
she
met
her
father
walking
up
and
down
before
the
house
and
informed
him
that
she
had
been
talking
to
heigham
he
looked
up
with
a
curious
expression
of
interest
did
you
not
ask
him
in
to
breakfast
he
said
there
is
nothing
to
eat
except
bread
and
perhaps
you
were
right
i
will
go
down
and
speak
to
him
no
i
forgot
i
shall
see
him
this
and
arthur
let
those
who
disbelieve
in
love
at
first
sight
laugh
if
they
will
sat
down
to
think
trembling
in
every
limb
utterly
shaken
by
the
inrush
of
a
new
and
strong
emotion
he
had
not
come
to
the
age
of
without
some
experience
of
the
other
sex
but
never
before
had
he
known
any
such
sensation
as
that
which
now
overpowered
him
never
before
had
he
fully
realized
what
solitude
meant
as
he
did
now
that
she
had
left
him
in
youth
when
love
does
come
he
comes
as
a
strong
man
armed
and
so
steady
and
overwhelming
all
resistance
the
full
tide
of
a
pure
passion
poured
itself
into
his
heart
there
was
no
pretence
or
about
it
the
bolt
that
sped
from
grey
eyes
had
gone
straight
home
and
would
remain
an
mark
so
long
as
life
itself
should
last
for
only
once
in
a
lifetime
does
a
man
succumb
after
this
fashion
to
many
indeed
no
such
it
good
or
ever
come
since
the
majority
of
men
flirt
or
marry
indulge
in
friendships
or
in
a
consistent
course
of
admiration
of
their
wives
as
fate
or
fancy
leads
them
and
wear
their
time
away
without
ever
having
known
the
meaning
of
such
love
as
this
there
is
no
fixed
rule
about
it
the
most
unlikely
even
the
more
sordid
and
contemptible
of
mankind
are
liable
to
become
the
subjects
of
an
enduring
passion
only
then
it
raises
them
for
though
strong
affection
especially
if
unrequited
sometimes
wears
and
enervates
the
mind
its
influence
is
in
the
main
undoubtedly
ennobling
but
though
such
affection
is
bounded
by
no
rule
it
is
curious
to
observe
how
generally
true
are
the
old
sayings
which
declare
that
a
thoughts
return
to
his
first
real
love
as
naturally
and
unconsciously
as
the
needle
that
has
for
a
while
been
drawn
aside
by
some
overmastering
influence
returns
to
its
magnetic
pole
the
needle
has
wavered
but
it
has
never
shaken
off
its
allegiance
that
would
be
against
nature
and
is
therefore
impossible
and
so
it
is
with
the
heart
it
is
the
eyes
that
he
loved
as
a
lad
which
he
sees
through
the
gathering
darkness
of
his
it
is
a
chance
but
that
he
will
always
adore
the
star
which
first
came
to
share
his
loneliness
in
this
shadowed
world
above
all
the
shining
multitudes
in
heaven
and
though
it
is
not
every
watcher
who
will
find
it
early
or
late
that
star
may
rise
for
him
as
it
did
for
arthur
now
a
man
may
meet
a
face
which
it
is
quite
beyond
his
power
to
forget
and
be
touched
of
lips
that
print
their
kiss
upon
his
very
heart
yes
the
star
may
rise
to
pursue
its
course
perhaps
beyond
the
ken
of
his
horizon
or
only
to
set
again
before
he
has
learnt
to
understand
its
rarely
very
rarely
to
shed
its
perfect
light
upon
him
for
all
his
time
of
watching
the
star
may
rise
and
set
the
sweet
lips
whose
touch
still
thrills
him
after
so
many
years
may
lie
the
barren
wall
or
worse
still
have
since
been
sold
to
some
richer
owner
but
if
once
it
has
risen
if
once
those
lips
have
met
the
memory
remain
the
soul
knows
no
forgetfulness
and
the
little
thread
of
life
spun
out
will
it
not
claim
its
own
for
the
compact
that
it
has
sealed
is
holy
among
holy
things
that
love
which
it
has
given
is
of
its
own
nature
and
not
of
the
body
is
inscrutable
as
death
and
everlasting
as
the
heavens
yes
the
fiat
has
gone
forth
for
good
or
for
evil
for
comfort
or
for
scorn
for
the
world
and
for
eternity
he
loves
her
henceforth
that
love
so
lightly
and
yet
so
irredeemably
given
will
become
the
guiding
spirit
of
his
inner
life
his
destinies
directing
his
ends
and
shooting
its
memories
and
hopes
through
the
whole
fabric
of
his
being
like
an
interwoven
thread
of
gold
he
may
sin
against
it
but
he
can
never
forget
it
other
interests
and
ties
may
overlay
it
but
they
can
not
extinguish
it
he
may
drown
its
fragrance
in
voluptuous
scents
but
when
these
have
satiated
and
become
hateful
it
will
pure
and
sweet
as
ever
time
or
separation
can
not
destroy
it
is
immortal
use
can
not
stale
it
pain
can
only
sanctify
it
it
will
be
to
him
as
a
to
the
mariner
that
tells
of
home
and
peace
upon
the
shore
as
a
set
upon
the
sky
it
alone
of
all
things
pertaining
to
him
will
defy
the
attacks
of
the
consuming
years
and
when
old
and
withered
he
lays
him
down
to
die
it
will
at
last
present
itself
before
his
glazing
eyes
an
embodied
joy
clad
in
shining
robes
and
breathing
the
airs
of
paradise
for
such
is
love
to
those
to
whom
it
has
been
given
to
see
him
face
to
face
chapter
xx
arthur
did
not
do
much
fishing
that
morning
indeed
he
never
so
much
as
got
his
line
into
the
simply
sat
there
lost
in
dreams
and
hoping
in
a
vague
way
that
angela
would
come
back
again
but
she
did
not
come
back
though
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
what
prevented
her
for
had
he
but
known
it
she
was
for
the
space
of
a
full
hour
sitting
within
a
hundred
yards
of
him
and
occasionally
peeping
out
to
watch
his
mode
of
fishing
with
some
curiosity
it
was
she
reflected
exceedingly
unlike
that
practised
by
jakes
she
too
was
wishing
that
he
would
detect
her
and
come
to
talk
to
her
but
amongst
other
new
sensations
she
was
now
the
victim
of
a
most
unaccountable
shyness
and
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
reveal
her
whereabouts
at
last
arthur
awoke
from
his
long
reverie
and
remembered
with
a
sudden
pang
that
he
had
had
nothing
to
eat
since
the
previous
evening
and
that
he
was
consequently
exceedingly
hungry
he
also
discovered
on
consulting
his
watch
that
it
was
twelve
and
moreover
that
he
was
quite
stiff
from
sitting
so
long
in
the
same
position
so
sighing
to
think
that
such
a
vulgar
necessity
as
that
of
obtaining
food
should
force
him
to
depart
he
put
up
his
unused
and
started
for
isleworth
where
he
arrived
just
as
the
bell
was
ringing
for
lunch
george
received
him
with
cold
civility
and
asked
him
what
sport
he
had
to
which
he
was
forced
to
you
see
anybody
there
i
met
miss
trust
a
girl
to
trail
out
a
man
what
is
she
like
i
remember
her
a
girl
of
fourteen
with
fine
think
that
she
is
the
handsomest
woman
i
ever
saw
arthur
replied
coldly
said
george
with
a
rude
little
laugh
is
always
enthusiastic
especially
when
the
object
is
of
the
dairymaid
there
was
something
so
intensely
insolent
in
his
way
of
talking
that
arthur
longed
to
throw
a
dish
at
him
but
he
restrained
his
feelings
and
dropped
the
subject
me
see
you
are
only
just
home
from
india
are
you
asked
george
presently
got
back
at
the
beginning
of
last
what
were
you
doing
there
about
and
you
get
much
sport
i
was
rather
unfortunate
but
i
and
another
fellow
killed
two
tigers
and
went
after
a
rogue
elephant
but
he
nearly
killed
us
i
got
some
very
good
in
cashmere
do
you
intend
to
do
with
yourself
now
your
education
has
been
extravagantly
expensive
especially
the
cambridge
part
of
it
are
you
going
to
turn
it
to
any
account
i
am
going
to
travel
for
another
year
and
then
read
for
the
bar
there
is
no
particular
object
in
being
called
too
young
and
i
wish
to
see
something
more
of
the
world
i
see
idleness
called
by
a
fine
i
can
not
agree
with
you
said
arthur
who
was
rapidly
losing
his
temper
course
you
but
every
man
has
a
right
to
choose
his
own
road
to
the
dogs
come
he
added
with
a
smile
of
malice
as
he
noticed
rising
colour
need
to
get
angry
you
see
i
stand
loco
and
feel
bound
to
express
my
must
congratulate
you
on
the
success
with
which
you
assume
the
character
answered
arthur
now
thoroughly
as
everything
i
have
done
or
mean
to
do
is
so
distasteful
to
you
i
think
it
is
a
pity
that
you
did
not
give
me
the
benefit
of
your
advice
a
little
only
answer
was
a
laugh
and
presently
the
two
parted
detesting
each
other
more
cordially
than
ever
at
three
when
george
was
still
away
for
he
had
gone
out
with
his
bailiff
immediately
after
lunch
philip
and
his
daughter
were
shown
into
the
where
we
may
be
sure
arthur
was
awaiting
them
caresfoot
is
not
back
yet
said
arthur
i
do
not
suppose
that
he
will
be
he
will
be
here
soon
said
philip
i
told
him
we
were
coming
to
call
what
sort
of
sport
did
you
have
what
none
i
am
very
sorry
you
must
come
and
try
i
forgot
you
are
going
away
by
the
way
heigham
why
should
you
go
just
yet
if
you
are
fond
of
fishing
and
have
nothing
better
to
do
come
and
put
up
at
the
abbey
house
for
a
while
we
are
plain
people
but
there
is
plenty
of
room
and
you
shall
have
a
hearty
welcome
would
you
care
to
come
it
would
have
been
amusing
to
any
outsider
to
watch
face
as
she
heard
this
astounding
proposition
for
nobody
had
been
invited
inside
her
doors
within
her
recollection
it
assumed
first
of
all
a
look
of
blank
amazement
which
was
presently
changed
into
one
of
absolute
horror
he
come
indeed
reflected
arthur
he
step
into
paradise
would
he
accept
the
humble
offer
of
free
quarters
in
the
garden
of
eden
rapture
beamed
so
visibly
from
every
feature
of
his
face
that
philip
saw
it
and
smiled
just
as
he
was
about
to
accept
with
enthusiasm
he
caught
sight
of
look
of
distress
it
chilled
him
like
the
sudden
shock
of
cold
water
she
did
not
wish
him
to
come
he
thought
she
did
not
care
for
him
obliged
however
to
give
an
answer
he
said
shall
be
delighted
here
he
bowed
towards
caresfoot
does
not
father
broke
in
angela
with
hesitation
could
arrange
that
heigham
came
not
it
would
be
more
convenient
i
must
get
a
room
domestic
details
i
had
overlooked
them
i
daresay
you
can
manage
heigham
yes
easily
thank
as
he
said
the
words
the
door
was
flung
open
and
was
announced
with
the
energy
that
a
footman
always
devotes
to
the
enunciation
of
a
title
and
next
second
a
splendid
creature
magnificently
dressed
sailed
into
the
room
how
do
you
do
caresfoot
she
said
in
that
low
rich
voice
that
he
remembered
so
well
is
some
time
since
we
met
indeed
it
quite
brings
back
old
times
to
see
you
when
we
were
all
young
people
any
rate
lady
bellamy
you
show
no
signs
of
age
indeed
if
you
will
permit
me
to
say
so
you
look
more
beautiful
than
caresfoot
you
have
not
forgotten
how
to
be
gallant
but
let
me
tell
you
that
it
entirely
depends
upon
what
light
i
am
in
if
you
saw
me
in
the
midst
of
one
of
those
newfangled
electric
illuminations
you
would
see
that
i
do
look
old
but
what
can
one
expect
at
forty
here
her
glance
fell
upon
face
for
the
first
time
and
she
absolutely
started
the
great
pupils
of
her
eyes
expanded
and
a
dark
frown
spread
itself
for
a
moment
over
her
countenance
next
second
it
was
gone
it
possible
that
that
beautiful
girl
is
your
daughter
but
remembering
her
mother
i
need
not
ask
look
at
her
caresfoot
and
then
look
at
me
and
say
whether
or
not
i
look
old
and
who
is
the
young
man
her
lover
i
any
rate
he
looks
like
it
but
please
introduce
said
philip
crossing
to
the
window
where
they
were
talking
me
introduce
you
to
lady
bellamy
am
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
miss
caresfoot
though
i
think
it
is
very
generous
of
me
to
say
angela
looked
puzzled
she
said
do
you
not
guess
why
it
is
generous
then
look
at
yourself
in
the
glass
and
you
will
see
i
used
to
have
some
pretension
to
good
looks
but
i
could
never
have
stood
beside
you
at
the
best
of
times
and
your
mother
even
when
i
was
at
my
best
always
me
if
i
was
in
the
same
room
with
her
and
you
are
even
handsomer
than
your
angela
blushed
very
much
at
this
unqualified
praise
and
putting
it
and
the
exclamation
her
appearance
had
that
morning
wrung
from
arthur
together
she
suddenly
came
to
the
odd
as
it
may
seem
she
had
never
before
taken
the
matter
into
serious
consideration
she
must
be
very
a
conclusion
that
made
her
feel
extremely
happy
she
could
not
quite
tell
why
it
was
whilst
she
was
thus
blushing
and
looking
her
happiest
and
loveliest
that
george
returning
from
his
walk
chanced
to
look
in
at
the
window
and
see
her
and
gradually
drawn
by
the
attraction
of
her
beauty
his
eyes
fixed
themselves
intently
upon
her
and
his
coarse
features
grew
instinct
with
a
mixture
of
hungry
wickedness
and
delighted
astonishment
it
was
thus
that
arthur
and
lady
bellamy
saw
him
philip
who
was
looking
at
a
picture
in
the
corner
of
the
room
did
not
see
him
nor
indeed
did
angela
the
look
was
unmistakable
and
once
more
the
dark
frown
settled
upon
lady
brow
and
the
expanding
pupils
filled
the
eyes
as
for
arthur
it
made
him
feel
sick
with
unreasonable
alarm
next
minute
george
entered
the
room
with
a
stupid
smile
upon
his
face
and
looking
as
dazed
as
a
bat
that
has
suddenly
been
shown
the
sun
beauty
had
come
upon
his
gross
mind
as
a
revelation
it
fascinated
him
he
had
lost
his
command
over
himself
here
you
are
at
last
george
said
lady
was
always
her
habit
to
call
him
george
have
all
been
like
sheep
without
a
shepherd
though
i
saw
you
keeping
an
eye
on
the
flock
through
the
george
started
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
been
observed
did
not
know
that
you
were
all
here
or
i
would
have
been
back
sooner
he
said
and
then
began
to
shake
hands
when
he
came
to
angela
he
favoured
her
with
a
tender
pressure
of
the
fingers
and
an
elaborate
and
speech
of
welcome
both
of
which
were
inexpressibly
disagreeable
to
her
but
here
lady
bellamy
intervened
and
skilfully
forced
him
into
a
conversation
with
her
in
which
philip
joined
does
lady
bellamy
remind
you
of
angela
asked
arthur
as
soon
as
the
hum
of
talk
made
it
improbable
that
they
would
be
overheard
an
egyptian
sorceress
i
think
look
at
the
low
broad
forehead
the
curling
hair
the
full
lips
and
the
inscrutable
look
of
the
my
mind
she
is
an
ideal
of
the
spirit
of
power
i
am
very
much
afraid
of
her
and
as
for
towards
dislike
him
even
more
than
i
was
prepared
to
and
she
gave
a
little
shudder
the
way
heigham
you
really
must
not
be
so
rash
as
to
accept
my
you
do
not
wish
to
see
me
of
course
i
will
not
he
answered
in
a
hurt
and
disappointed
tone
it
is
not
that
indeed
how
could
you
think
so
when
only
this
morning
we
agreed
to
be
friends
what
is
it
then
he
asked
blankly
heigham
the
fact
is
that
is
my
old
nurse
and
i
for
my
father
is
irregular
in
his
meals
and
always
takes
them
by
so
very
plainly
and
i
am
ashamed
to
ask
you
to
share
our
mode
of
life
for
instance
we
have
nothing
but
bread
and
milk
for
breakfast
and
the
golden
head
sunk
in
some
confusion
before
his
amused
gaze
is
that
all
he
said
cheerily
am
very
fond
of
bread
and
then
went
on
angela
with
her
confession
never
drink
wine
and
i
know
that
gentlemen
am
a
teetotaller
so
that
does
not
then
you
know
my
father
shuts
himself
up
all
day
so
that
you
will
have
nobody
but
myself
to
talk
never
am
sure
that
we
shall
get
if
in
spite
of
all
this
and
a
great
deal
a
very
great
deal
that
i
have
not
time
to
tell
still
care
to
come
i
will
do
my
best
to
amuse
you
at
any
rate
we
can
read
together
that
will
be
something
if
you
find
me
too
stupid
you
must
remember
that
i
have
only
had
a
private
education
and
have
never
been
to
college
like
you
i
shall
be
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
rubbing
up
my
classics
a
little
i
have
been
neglecting
them
rather
lately
and
actually
got
into
a
mess
over
a
passage
in
aristophanes
that
i
shall
ask
you
to
clear
this
was
enough
for
arthur
whose
knowledge
of
the
classics
was
that
of
the
ordinary
university
graduate
he
turned
the
subject
with
remarkable
promptitude
me
he
said
looking
her
straight
in
the
face
you
glad
that
i
am
coming
the
grey
eyes
dropped
a
little
before
the
boldness
of
his
gaze
but
she
answered
unhesitatingly
for
my
own
sake
i
am
glad
but
i
fear
that
you
will
find
it
very
angela
we
must
be
off
i
want
to
be
home
by
a
quarter
to
six
said
philip
just
then
she
rose
at
once
and
shook
hands
with
arthur
murmuring
till
morning
and
then
with
lady
bellamy
george
meanwhile
with
the
most
unwonted
hospitality
was
pressing
her
father
to
stay
to
dinner
and
when
he
declined
announcing
his
intention
of
coming
over
to
see
him
on
the
morrow
at
last
he
got
away
but
not
before
lady
bellamy
had
bid
him
a
seemingly
cordial
adieu
and
your
charming
daughter
must
come
and
see
me
at
rewtham
house
when
we
get
in
what
have
you
not
heard
that
sir
john
has
bought
it
from
poor
maria
executors
philip
turned
pale
as
death
and
hurried
from
the
room
is
good
reflected
lady
bellamy
as
she
watched
the
effect
of
her
shaft
let
him
know
that
i
never
but
even
when
her
father
had
gone
the
path
was
still
blocked
to
angela
said
george
who
was
when
in
an
amiable
mood
that
worst
of
all
cads
a
jocose
cad
you
going
to
play
truant
too
my
pretty
cousin
then
first
you
must
pay
the
penalty
not
a
very
heavy
one
and
he
threw
his
long
arm
round
her
waist
and
prepared
to
give
her
a
cousinly
embrace
at
first
angela
not
being
accustomed
to
little
jokes
of
the
sort
did
not
understand
what
his
intentions
were
but
as
soon
as
she
did
being
an
extremely
powerful
young
woman
she
soon
put
a
stop
to
them
shaking
george
away
from
her
so
sharply
by
a
little
swing
of
her
lithe
body
that
stumbling
over
a
footstool
in
his
rapid
backward
passage
he
in
a
trice
measured
his
length
upon
the
floor
seeing
what
she
had
done
angela
turned
and
fled
after
her
father
as
for
arthur
the
scene
was
too
much
for
his
risible
nerves
and
he
fairly
roared
with
laughter
whilst
even
lady
bellamy
went
as
near
to
it
as
she
ever
did
george
rose
white
with
wrath
heigham
he
said
see
nothing
to
laugh
at
in
an
you
replied
arthur
do
it
is
just
the
most
ludicrous
accident
that
i
ever
george
turned
away
muttering
something
that
it
was
perhaps
as
well
his
guest
did
not
hear
and
at
once
began
to
attack
lady
bellamy
dear
george
was
her
rejoinder
this
little
adventure
teach
you
that
it
is
not
wise
for
men
to
indulge
in
gallantries
towards
young
ladies
and
especially
young
ladies
of
thews
and
sinews
at
the
same
moment
the
footman
announced
that
the
which
arthur
had
ordered
was
waiting
for
him
heigham
said
george
with
angry
sarcasm
hours
you
have
killed
my
favourite
dog
taken
offence
at
my
advice
and
ridiculed
my
misfortune
if
we
should
ever
meet
again
doubtless
you
will
have
further
surprises
in
store
for
me
and
without
giving
arthur
time
to
make
any
reply
he
left
the
room
chapter
xxi
early
on
the
day
following
departure
from
isleworth
lady
bellamy
received
a
note
from
george
requesting
her
if
convenient
to
come
and
see
him
that
morning
as
he
had
something
rather
important
to
talk
to
her
about
she
said
to
her
husband
at
breakfast
you
want
the
brougham
this
morning
why
i
am
going
over
to
you
better
take
the
too
and
your
luggage
in
it
and
live
there
altogether
it
would
save
trouble
sending
backwards
and
forwards
suggested
her
husband
with
severe
sarcasm
lady
bellamy
cut
the
top
off
an
egg
with
a
single
clean
her
movements
were
she
answered
thought
she
said
we
had
done
with
that
sort
of
nonsense
some
years
ago
are
you
going
to
begin
it
again
lady
bellamy
i
am
i
am
not
going
to
stand
being
bullied
and
jeered
at
by
that
damned
scoundrel
caresfoot
any
more
i
am
not
going
to
stand
your
eternal
visits
to
have
stood
them
for
twenty
years
rather
late
in
the
day
to
object
now
it
she
remarked
coolly
beginning
her
egg
is
never
too
late
to
mend
it
is
not
too
late
for
you
to
stop
quietly
at
home
and
do
your
duty
by
your
men
would
think
that
i
had
done
my
duty
by
him
pretty
well
twenty
years
ago
you
were
nobody
and
had
comparatively
speaking
nothing
now
you
have
a
title
and
between
three
and
four
thousand
a
year
who
have
you
to
thank
for
that
certainly
not
the
title
and
the
money
i
had
rather
be
a
poor
devil
of
an
attorney
with
a
large
family
and
five
hundred
a
year
to
keep
them
on
than
live
the
life
i
do
between
you
and
that
vulgar
beast

a
life
not
a
and
poor
bellamy
was
so
overcome
at
his
real
or
imaginary
wrongs
that
the
tears
actually
rolled
down
his
puffy
little
face
his
wife
surveyed
him
with
some
amusement
think
she
said
you
are
a
miserable
i
am
anne
but
i
tell
you
what
it
is
even
a
miserable
creature
can
be
driven
too
far
it
may
perhaps
be
worth
your
while
to
be
a
little
she
cast
one
swift
look
at
him
a
look
not
without
apprehension
in
it
for
there
was
a
ring
about
his
voice
that
she
did
not
like
but
his
appearance
was
so
ludicrously
wretched
that
it
reassured
her
she
finished
her
egg
and
then
slowly
driving
the
spoon
through
the
shell
she
said
threaten
john
it
is
a
bad
habit
and
shows
an
state
of
mind
besides
it
might
force
me
to
you
in
defence
you
know
and
john
and
the
having
finally
collapsed
together
lady
bellamy
ordered
the
brougham
having
thus
sufficiently
scourged
her
husband
she
departed
in
due
course
to
visit
her
own
taskmaster
little
guessing
what
awaited
her
at
his
hands
after
all
there
is
a
deal
of
poetic
justice
in
the
world
little
smith
fresh
from
his
is
savagely
beaten
by
the
cock
of
the
school
jones
and
to
him
jones
is
an
cruel
devil
placed
above
all
possibility
of
retribution
if
however
little
smith
could
see
the
omnipotent
jones
being
mentally
ploughed
and
harrowed
by
his
papa
the
clergyman
in
celebration
of
the
double
event
of
his
having
missed
a
scholarship
and
taken
too
much
sherry
it
is
probable
that
his
wounded
feelings
would
be
greatly
soothed
nor
does
it
stop
there
robinson
the
squire
of
the
parish
takes
it
out
of
the
reverend
jones
and
speaks
ill
of
him
to
the
bishop
a
low
churchman
on
the
matter
of
vestments
and
very
shortly
afterwards
sir
buster
brown
the
chairman
of
the
quarter
sessions
expresses
his
opinion
pretty
freely
of
robinson
in
his
magisterial
capacity
only
in
his
turn
to
receive
a
most
unexampled
wigging
from
her
judge
baron
muddlebone
for
not
showing
him
that
respect
he
was
accustomed
to
receive
from
the
high
sheriff
of
the
county
and
even
over
the
august
person
of
the
judge
himself
there
hangs
the
fear
of
the
only
thing
that
he
can
not
commit
for
contempt
public
opinion
justice
why
the
world
is
full
of
it
only
it
is
mostly
built
upon
a
foundation
of
wrong
lady
bellamy
found
george
sitting
in
the
beside
the
safe
that
had
so
greatly
interested
her
husband
it
was
open
and
he
was
reading
a
selection
from
the
bundle
of
letters
which
the
reader
may
remember
having
seen
in
his
hands
before
do
anne
he
said
without
rising
look
very
handsome
this
morning
i
never
saw
a
woman
wear
she
vouchsafed
no
reply
to
his
greeting
but
turned
as
pale
as
death
she
said
huskily
pointing
with
her
finger
to
the
letters
in
his
hand
are
you
doing
with
those
letters
anne
quite
tragic
what
a
lady
macbeth
you
would
make
come
quote
the
perfumes
of
araby
will
not
sweeten
this
little
hand
oh
oh
oh
go
are
you
doing
with
those
letters
you
never
broken
a
dog
by
showing
him
the
whip
anne
i
have
got
something
to
ask
of
you
and
i
wish
to
get
you
into
a
generous
frame
of
mind
first
listen
now
i
am
going
to
read
you
a
few
extracts
from
a
past
that
is
so
vividly
recorded
she
sank
into
a
chair
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
groaned
george
whose
own
features
betrayed
a
certain
nervousness
took
a
yellow
sheet
of
paper
and
began
to
read
you
know
how
old
i
am
nineteen
and
i
have
been
married
a
year
and
a
half
ah
what
a
happy
lass
i
was
before
i
married
how
they
worshipped
me
in
my
old
home
anne
they
always
called
me
well
they
are
dead
now
and
pray
god
they
sleep
so
sound
that
they
can
neither
hear
nor
see
yes
a
year
and
a
year
of
happiness
half
a
year
of
hell
happiness
whilst
i
did
not
know
you
hell
since
i
saw
your
face
what
secret
spring
of
wickedness
did
you
touch
in
my
heart
i
never
had
a
thought
of
wrong
before
you
came
but
when
i
first
set
eyes
upon
your
face
i
felt
some
strange
change
come
over
me
i
recognized
my
evil
destiny
how
you
discovered
my
fascination
how
you
led
me
on
to
evil
you
best
know
i
am
no
coward
i
do
not
wish
to
excuse
myself
but
sometimes
i
think
that
you
have
much
to
answer
for
george
hark
i
hear
my
baby
crying
my
beautiful
boy
with
his
eyes
do
you
know
i
believe
that
the
child
has
grown
afraid
of
me
it
beats
at
me
with
its
tiny
hands
i
think
that
my
very
dog
dislikes
me
now
they
know
me
as
i
am
nature
tells
them
everybody
knows
me
except
he
will
come
in
presently
from
visiting
his
sick
and
poor
and
kiss
me
and
call
me
his
sweet
wife
and
i
shall
act
the
living
lie
oh
god
i
can
not
bear
it
much
is
more
of
the
same
sort
remarked
george
coolly
affords
a
most
interesting
study
of
mental
anatomy
but
i
have
no
time
to
read
more
of
it
we
will
pass
on
to
lady
bellamy
did
not
move
she
sat
trembling
a
little
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
he
took
up
a
second
letter
and
began
to
read
a
marked
passage
die
is
cast
i
will
come
i
can
no
longer
resist
your
influence
it
grows
stronger
every
day
and
now
it
makes
me
a
murderess
for
the
shock
will
kill
him
and
yet
i
am
tired
of
the
sameness
and
smallness
of
my
life
my
mind
is
too
big
to
be
cramped
in
such
narrow
extract
is
really
very
funny
said
george
critically
look
depressed
anne
i
am
only
going
to
trouble
you
with
one
more
dated
a
year
or
so
later
listen
have
several
times
seen
the
man
you
sent
me
he
is
a
fool
and
contemptible
in
appearance
and
worst
of
all
shows
signs
of
falling
in
love
with
me
but
if
you
wish
it
i
will
go
through
the
marriage
ceremony
with
him
poor
little
dupe
you
will
not
marry
me
yourself
and
i
would
do
more
than
that
to
keep
near
you
indeed
i
have
no
choice
i
keep
near
you
i
went
to
the
zoological
gardens
the
other
day
and
saw
a
rattlesnake
fed
upon
a
live
rabbit
the
poor
thing
had
ample
room
to
run
away
in
but
could
not
it
was
fascinated
and
sat
still
and
screamed
at
last
the
snake
struck
it
and
i
thought
that
its
eyes
looked
like
yours
i
am
as
helpless
as
that
poor
animal
and
you
are
much
more
cruel
than
the
snake
and
yet
my
mind
is
infinitely
stronger
than
your
own
in
every
way
i
can
not
understand
it
what
is
the
source
of
your
power
over
me
but
i
am
quite
reckless
now
so
what
does
it
matter
i
will
do
anything
that
does
not
put
me
within
reach
of
the
law
you
know
that
my
husband
is
dead
i
that
he
would
die
he
expired
with
my
name
upon
his
lips
the
child
too
i
hear
died
in
a
fit
of
croup
the
nurse
had
gone
out
and
there
was
no
one
to
look
after
it
upon
my
word
i
may
well
be
reckless
for
there
is
no
forgiveness
for
such
as
you
and
i
as
for
little
as
i
think
i
told
you
i
will
lead
him
on
and
marry
him
at
any
rate
i
will
make
his
fortune
for
him
i
devote
myself
to
something
and
ambition
is
more
absorbing
than
anything
least
i
shall
rise
to
something
great
i
know
which
aches
most
my
head
or
my
that
extract
would
be
interesting
reading
to
bellamy
would
it
not
here
she
suddenly
sprang
forward
and
snatched
at
the
letter
but
george
was
too
quick
for
her
he
flung
it
into
the
safe
by
his
side
and
swung
the
heavy
lid
to
no
my
dear
anne
that
property
is
too
valuable
to
be
parted
with
except
for
a
her
attempt
frustrated
she
dropped
back
into
her
chair
are
you
torturing
me
for
she
asked
hoarsely
you
any
object
in
dragging
up
the
ghost
of
that
dead
past
or
is
it
merely
for
amusement
i
not
tell
you
that
i
had
a
favour
to
ask
of
you
and
wished
to
get
you
into
a
proper
frame
of
mind
first
favour
you
mean
that
you
have
some
wickedness
in
hand
that
you
are
too
great
a
coward
to
execute
yourself
out
with
it
i
know
you
too
well
to
be
very
well
you
saw
angela
caresfoot
daughter
here
i
saw
good
i
mean
to
marry
her
and
you
must
manage
it
for
lady
bellamy
sat
quite
still
and
made
no
answer
will
now
continued
george
relieved
to
find
that
he
had
not
provoked
the
outburst
he
had
expected
why
i
read
you
those
extracts
i
am
thoroughly
determined
upon
marrying
that
girl
at
whatever
cost
and
i
see
very
clearly
that
i
shall
not
be
able
to
do
so
without
your
help
with
your
help
the
matter
will
be
easy
for
no
obstacle
except
the
death
of
the
girl
herself
can
prevail
against
your
iron
determination
and
unbounded
fertility
of
if
i
refuse
must
have
read
those
extracts
to
very
little
purpose
for
you
to
talk
about
refusing
if
you
refuse
the
pangs
of
conscience
will
overcome
me
and
i
shall
feel
obliged
to
place
these
letters
and
more
especially
those
referring
to
himself
in
the
hands
of
your
husband
of
course
it
will
for
my
own
sake
be
unpleasant
to
me
to
have
to
do
so
but
i
can
easily
travel
for
a
year
or
two
till
the
talk
has
blown
over
for
you
it
will
be
different
bellamy
has
no
cause
to
love
you
now
judge
what
he
will
feel
when
he
knows
all
the
truth
he
will
scarcely
keep
the
story
to
himself
and
even
were
he
to
do
so
it
could
easily
be
set
about
in
other
ways
and
in
either
case
you
will
be
a
ruined
woman
and
all
that
you
have
toiled
and
schemed
for
for
twenty
years
will
be
snatched
from
you
in
an
instant
if
on
the
other
hand
you
do
not
refuse
and
i
can
not
believe
that
you
will
i
will
on
my
burn
these
uncomfortable
records
before
your
eyes
or
if
you
prefer
it
you
shall
burn
them
have
only
seen
this
girl
once
is
it
possible
that
you
are
in
earnest
in
wishing
to
marry
her
you
think
that
i
should
go
through
this
scene
by
way
of
a
joke
i
never
was
so
much
in
earnest
in
my
life
before
i
am
in
love
with
her
i
tell
you
as
much
in
love
as
though
i
had
known
her
for
years
what
happened
to
you
with
reference
to
me
has
happened
to
me
with
reference
to
her
or
something
very
like
it
and
marry
her
i
must
and
lady
bellamy
as
she
heard
these
words
rose
from
her
chair
and
flung
herself
on
the
ground
before
him
clasping
his
knees
with
her
hands
george
george
she
cried
in
a
broken
voice
some
little
pity
do
not
force
me
to
do
this
unnatural
thing
is
your
heart
a
stone
or
are
you
altogether
a
devil
that
by
such
cruel
threats
you
can
drive
me
into
becoming
the
instrument
of
my
own
shame
i
know
what
i
am
none
better
but
for
whose
sake
did
i
become
so
surely
george
i
have
some
claim
on
your
compassion
if
i
have
none
on
your
love
think
again
george
and
if
you
will
not
give
her
up
choose
some
other
means
to
compass
this
poor
up
anne
and
talk
sentimental
rubbish
not
but
what
he
added
with
a
sneer
is
rather
amusing
to
hear
you
pitying
your
successful
she
sprang
to
her
feet
all
the
softness
and
entreaty
gone
from
her
face
which
was
instead
now
spread
with
her
darkest
and
most
vindictive
look
pity
her
she
said
hate
her
look
you
if
i
have
to
do
this
my
only
consolation
will
be
in
knowing
that
what
i
do
will
drag
my
successor
down
below
my
own
level
i
suffer
she
shall
suffer
more
i
know
you
a
fiend
she
shall
find
a
whole
hell
with
you
she
is
purer
and
better
than
i
have
ever
been
soon
you
shall
make
her
worse
than
i
have
dreamt
of
being
her
purity
shall
be
dishonoured
her
love
betrayed
her
life
reduced
to
such
chaos
that
she
shall
cease
to
believe
even
in
her
god
and
in
return
for
these
things
i
will
give
your
new
plaything
shall
pass
through
my
mill
george
caresfoot
before
ever
she
comes
to
yours
and
on
her
i
will
repay
with
interest
all
that
i
have
suffered
at
your
hands
and
exhausted
with
the
fierceness
of
her
own
invective
and
the
violence
of
conflicting
passions
she
sank
back
into
her
chair
anne
quite
in
your
old
style
i
daresay
that
the
young
lady
will
require
a
little
moulding
and
she
could
not
be
in
better
hands
but
mind
no
am
not
going
to
be
cheated
out
of
my
need
not
fear
george
i
shall
not
murder
her
i
do
not
believe
in
violence
it
is
the
last
resort
of
fools
if
i
did
you
would
not
be
alive
george
laughed
a
little
uneasily
we
are
good
friends
again
so
there
is
no
need
to
talk
of
such
things
he
said
campaign
will
not
be
by
any
means
an
easy
there
are
many
obstacles
in
the
way
and
i
think
that
my
intended
has
taken
a
particular
fancy
to
me
you
will
have
to
work
for
your
letters
anne
but
first
of
all
take
a
day
or
two
to
think
it
over
and
make
a
plan
of
the
campaign
and
now
i
have
got
a
bad
headache
and
am
going
to
lie
she
rose
and
went
without
another
word
but
all
necessity
for
setting
about
her
shameful
task
was
soon
postponed
by
news
that
reached
her
the
next
morning
to
the
effect
that
george
caresfoot
was
seriously
chapter
xxii
the
that
arthur
had
hired
to
take
him
away
belonged
to
an
inn
in
the
parish
of
rewtham
situated
about
a
mile
from
rewtham
house
which
had
just
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
bellamys
and
two
from
bratham
abbey
and
thither
arthur
had
himself
driven
his
jehu
known
through
all
the
country
round
as
sam
was
an
ancient
ostler
who
had
been
in
the
service
of
the
rewtham
head
man
and
boy
for
over
fifty
years
and
from
him
arthur
collected
a
good
deal
of
inaccurate
information
about
the
caresfoot
family
including
a
garbled
version
of
all
the
death
of
mother
and
disinheritance
after
all
there
are
few
more
comfortable
places
than
an
inn
not
a
huge
london
hotel
where
you
are
known
as
no
and
have
to
lock
the
door
of
your
cell
when
you
come
out
of
it
and
deliver
up
your
key
to
the
warder
in
the
hall
but
an
country
establishment
where
they
cook
your
breakfast
exactly
as
you
like
it
and
give
you
sound
ale
and
a
at
least
so
thought
arthur
as
he
sat
in
the
private
parlour
smoking
his
pipe
and
reflecting
on
the
curious
vicissitudes
of
existence
now
here
he
was
with
all
the
hopes
and
interests
of
his
life
utterly
changed
in
a
single
space
of
twenty
hours
why
hours
ago
he
had
never
met
his
respected
guardian
nor
sir
john
and
lady
bellamy
nor
philip
and
his
daughter
he
could
hardly
believe
that
it
was
only
that
morning
that
he
had
first
seen
angela
it
seemed
weeks
ago
and
if
time
could
have
been
measured
on
a
new
principle
by
events
and
not
by
minutes
it
would
have
been
weeks
the
wheel
of
life
he
thought
revolves
with
a
strange
irregularity
for
months
and
years
it
turns
slowly
and
steadily
under
the
even
pressure
of
monotonous
events
but
on
some
unexpected
day
a
tide
comes
rushing
down
the
stream
of
being
and
spins
it
round
at
speed
and
then
tears
onward
to
the
ocean
called
the
past
leaving
its
plaything
to
creak
and
turn
to
turn
and
creak
or
wrecked
perhaps
and
useless
thinking
thus
arthur
made
his
way
to
bed
the
excitement
of
the
day
had
wearied
him
and
for
a
while
he
slept
soundly
but
as
the
fatigue
of
the
body
wore
off
the
activity
of
his
mind
asserted
itself
and
he
began
to
dream
vague
happy
dreams
of
angela
that
by
degrees
took
shape
and
form
till
they
stood
out
clear
before
the
vision
of
his
mind
he
dreamt
that
he
and
angela
were
journeying
two
such
happy
travellers
through
the
green
fields
in
summer
till
they
came
to
the
dark
entrance
of
a
wood
into
which
they
plunged
fearing
nothing
thicker
grew
the
overshadowing
branches
and
darker
grew
the
path
and
now
they
journeyed
with
their
arms
around
each
other
but
as
they
passed
along
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
paths
forked
and
here
he
stooped
to
kiss
her
already
he
could
feel
the
thrill
of
her
embrace
when
she
was
swept
from
him
by
an
unseen
force
and
carried
down
the
path
before
them
leaving
him
rooted
where
he
was
but
still
he
could
trace
her
progress
as
she
went
wringing
her
hands
in
sorrow
and
presently
he
saw
the
form
of
lady
bellamy
robed
as
an
egyptian
sorceress
and
holding
a
letter
in
her
hand
which
she
offered
to
angela
whispering
in
her
ear
she
took
it
and
then
in
a
second
the
letter
turned
to
a
great
snake
with
head
that
threw
its
coils
around
her
and
struck
at
her
with
its
fangs
next
the
darkness
of
night
rushed
down
upon
the
scene
and
out
of
the
darkness
came
wild
cries
and
mocking
laughter
and
the
choking
sounds
of
death
and
his
senses
left
him
when
sight
and
sense
came
back
he
dreamt
that
he
was
still
walking
down
a
wooded
lane
but
the
foliage
of
the
overhanging
trees
was
of
a
richer
green
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
scent
of
unknown
flowers
beautiful
birds
flitted
around
him
and
from
came
the
murmur
of
the
sea
and
as
he
travelled
a
fair
woman
with
a
gentle
voice
stood
by
his
side
and
kissed
and
comforted
him
till
at
length
he
grew
weary
of
her
kisses
and
she
left
him
weeping
and
he
went
on
his
way
alone
seeking
his
lost
angela
and
then
at
length
the
path
took
a
sudden
turn
and
he
stood
on
the
shore
of
an
illimitable
ocean
over
which
brooded
a
strange
light
as
where
quiet
end
of
evening
smiles
miles
on
and
there
with
the
soft
light
lingering
on
her
hair
and
tears
of
gladness
in
her
eyes
stood
angela
more
lovely
than
before
her
arms
outstretched
to
greet
him
and
then
the
night
closed
in
and
he
awoke
his
eyes
opened
upon
the
solemn
and
beautiful
hour
of
the
first
quickening
of
the
dawn
and
the
thrill
and
softness
that
comes
from
contact
with
the
things
we
meet
in
sleep
was
still
upon
him
he
got
up
and
flung
open
his
lattice
window
from
the
garden
beneath
rose
the
sweet
scent
of
may
flowers
very
different
from
that
of
his
dream
which
yet
lingered
in
his
nostrils
whilst
from
a
neighbouring
bush
streamed
the
rich
melody
of
the
nightingale
presently
it
ceased
before
the
broadening
daylight
but
in
its
stead
pure
and
clear
and
cold
arose
the
notes
of
the
mavis
giving
tuneful
thanks
and
glory
to
its
maker
and
as
he
listened
a
great
calm
stole
upon
his
spirit
and
kneeling
down
there
by
the
open
window
with
the
breath
of
spring
upon
his
brow
and
the
voice
of
the
happy
birds
within
his
ears
he
prayed
to
the
almighty
with
all
his
heart
that
it
might
please
him
in
his
wise
mercy
to
verify
his
dream
inasmuch
as
he
would
be
well
content
to
suffer
if
by
suffering
he
might
at
last
attain
to
such
an
unutterable
joy
and
rising
from
his
knees
feeling
better
and
stronger
he
knew
in
some
dim
way
that
that
undertaking
must
be
blest
which
in
such
a
solemn
hour
of
the
heart
he
did
not
fear
to
pray
god
to
guide
to
guard
and
to
consummate
and
on
many
an
and
in
many
another
place
the
book
of
his
life
would
reopen
at
this
page
and
he
would
see
the
dim
light
in
the
faint
flushed
sky
and
hear
the
song
of
the
thrush
swelling
upwards
strong
and
sweet
and
remember
his
prayer
and
the
peace
that
fell
upon
his
soul
by
ten
that
morning
arthur
his
dog
and
his
portmanteau
had
all
arrived
together
in
front
of
the
abbey
house
before
his
feet
had
touched
the
gravel
the
was
flung
open
and
angela
appeared
to
welcome
him
looking
as
old
sam
the
ostler
forcibly
put
it
afterwards
to
his
helper
like
a
hangel
with
the
wings
jakes
too
emerged
from
the
recesses
of
the
garden
and
asked
angela
in
a
tone
of
aggrieved
sarcasm
as
he
edged
his
way
suspiciously
past
aleck
why
the
gentleman
had
not
brought
the
lion
from
the
zoologic
with
him
at
once
having
thus
expressed
his
feelings
on
the
subject
of
he
shouldered
the
portmanteau
and
made
his
way
with
it
upstairs
arthur
followed
him
up
the
wide
oak
stairs
every
one
of
which
was
squared
out
of
a
single
log
stopping
for
a
while
on
the
landing
where
the
staircase
turned
to
gaze
at
the
picture
that
hung
so
that
it
looked
through
the
large
window
facing
it
right
across
the
park
and
over
the
whole
stretch
of
the
abbey
lands
and
to
wonder
at
the
inscription
of
set
so
conspicuously
beneath
his
room
was
the
largest
upon
the
first
landing
and
the
same
in
which
mother
had
died
it
had
never
been
used
from
that
hour
to
this
and
indeed
in
a
little
recess
or
open
space
between
a
cupboard
and
the
wall
there
still
stood
two
trestles
draped
with
rotten
black
cloth
that
had
originally
been
brought
there
to
rest
her
coffin
on
and
which
angela
had
overlooked
in
getting
the
room
ready
this
spacious
but
somewhat
gloomy
apartment
was
hung
round
with
portraits
of
the
caresfoots
of
past
ages
many
of
which
bore
a
marked
resemblance
to
philip
but
amongst
whom
he
looked
in
vain
for
one
in
the
slightest
degree
like
angela
whose
handiwork
he
recognized
in
two
large
bowls
of
flowers
placed
upon
the
dark
oak
just
as
jakes
had
finished
unbuckling
his
portmanteau
a
task
that
he
had
undertaken
with
some
groaning
and
was
departing
in
haste
lest
he
should
be
asked
to
do
something
else
arthur
caught
sight
of
the
trestles
are
those
he
asked
cheerfully
was
the
abrupt
reply
ejaculated
arthur
feeling
that
it
was
unpleasant
to
have
little
details
connected
with
latter
end
brought
thus
abruptly
into
notice
the
deuce
are
they
doing
here
to
put
the
last
as
slept
in
that
bed
on
and
stood
ever
you
think
insinuated
arthur
gently
you
had
better
take
them
away
do
so
they
be
part
of
the
furniture
they
there
all
handy
for
the
next
one
too
maybe
you
and
he
vanished
with
a
sardonic
grin
jakes
did
not
submit
to
the
indignities
of
unbuckling
portmanteaus
and
having
his
legs
sniffed
at
by
for
nothing
not
by
any
means
pleased
by
suggestions
so
unpleasant
arthur
took
his
way
downstairs
determined
to
renew
the
question
with
his
host
he
found
angela
waiting
for
him
in
the
hall
and
making
friends
with
aleck
you
come
in
and
see
my
father
for
a
minute
before
we
go
out
she
said
arthur
assented
and
she
led
the
way
into
the
study
where
philip
always
sat
the
same
room
in
which
his
father
had
died
he
was
sitting
at
a
as
usual
at
work
on
farm
accounts
rising
he
greeted
arthur
civilly
taking
however
no
notice
of
his
daughter
although
he
had
not
seen
her
since
the
previous
day
heigham
so
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
brave
these
barbarous
wilds
have
you
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
but
i
must
warn
you
that
beyond
a
pipe
and
a
glass
of
grog
in
the
evening
i
have
not
much
time
to
put
at
your
disposal
we
are
rather
a
curious
household
i
know
whether
angela
has
told
you
but
for
one
thing
we
do
not
take
our
meals
together
so
you
will
have
to
make
your
choice
between
the
and
the
nursery
for
my
daughter
is
not
out
of
the
nursery
yet
and
he
gave
a
little
laugh
the
whole
perhaps
you
had
better
be
relegated
to
the
nursery
it
will
at
any
rate
be
more
amusing
to
you
that
the
society
of
a
morose
old
fellow
like
myself
and
besides
i
am
very
irregular
in
my
habits
angela
you
are
staring
at
me
again
i
should
be
so
very
much
obliged
if
you
would
look
the
other
way
i
only
hope
heigham
that
old
pigott
talk
your
head
off
she
has
got
a
dreadful
tongue
well
let
me
keep
you
any
longer
it
is
a
lovely
day
for
the
time
of
year
try
to
amuse
yourself
somehow
and
i
hope
for
your
sake
that
angela
will
not
occupy
herself
with
you
as
she
does
with
me
by
staring
as
though
she
wished
to
examine
your
brains
and
backbone
for
the
does
he
mean
asked
arthur
as
soon
as
they
were
fairly
outside
the
door
your
staring
at
him
answered
poor
angela
who
looked
as
though
she
were
going
to
cry
wish
i
could
tell
you
all
i
know
is
that
he
can
not
bear
me
to
look
at
is
always
complaining
of
it
that
is
why
we
do
not
take
our
meals
least
i
believe
it
is
he
detests
my
being
near
him
i
am
sure
i
know
why
it
makes
me
very
unhappy
i
can
not
see
anything
different
in
my
eyes
from
anybody
can
you
and
she
turned
them
swimming
as
they
were
with
tears
of
mortification
full
upon
arthur
he
scrutinized
their
depths
very
closely
so
closely
indeed
that
presently
she
turned
them
away
again
with
a
blush
she
said
am
sure
you
have
looked
long
enough
are
they
different
different
replied
the
oracle
with
enthusiasm
are
that
all
they
are
is
nothing
i
want
to
know
if
they
produce
any
unpleasant
effect
upon
from
other
eyes
i
mean
if
you
ask
me
i
am
afraid
that
your
eyes
do
produce
a
strange
effect
upon
me
but
i
can
not
say
that
it
is
an
unpleasant
one
but
you
did
not
look
long
enough
for
me
to
form
a
really
sound
opinion
let
us
try
i
will
not
and
i
do
believe
that
you
are
laughing
at
me
i
think
that
is
very
unkind
and
she
marched
on
in
silence
be
angry
with
me
or
i
shall
be
miserable
i
really
was
not
laughing
at
you
only
if
you
knew
what
wonderful
eyes
you
have
got
you
would
not
ask
such
ridiculous
questions
about
them
your
father
must
be
a
strange
man
to
get
such
ideas
i
am
sure
i
should
be
delighted
if
you
would
look
at
me
all
day
long
but
tell
me
something
more
about
your
father
he
interests
me
very
angela
felt
the
blood
rise
to
her
face
as
he
praised
her
eyes
and
bit
her
lips
with
vexation
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
suddenly
caught
an
epidemic
of
blushing
can
not
tell
you
very
much
about
my
father
because
i
do
not
know
much
his
life
is
to
a
great
extent
a
sealed
book
to
me
but
they
say
that
once
he
was
a
very
different
man
when
he
was
quite
young
i
mean
but
all
of
a
sudden
his
you
picture
is
on
the
stairs
died
and
within
a
day
or
two
my
mother
died
too
that
was
when
i
was
born
after
that
he
broke
down
and
became
what
he
is
now
for
twenty
years
he
has
lived
as
he
does
now
poring
all
day
over
books
of
accounts
and
very
rarely
seeing
anybody
for
he
does
all
his
business
by
letter
or
nearly
all
of
it
and
he
has
no
friends
there
was
some
story
about
his
being
engaged
to
a
lady
who
lived
at
rewtham
when
he
married
my
mother
which
i
daresay
you
have
heard
but
i
know
much
about
it
but
here
she
dropped
her
is
one
thing
that
i
must
warn
you
of
my
father
has
strange
fancies
at
times
he
is
dreadfully
superstitious
and
thinks
that
he
has
communications
with
beings
from
another
world
i
believe
that
it
is
all
nonsense
but
i
tell
you
so
that
you
may
not
be
surprised
at
anything
he
says
or
does
he
is
not
a
happy
man
not
i
can
not
imagine
any
one
being
happy
who
is
superstitious
it
is
the
most
dreadful
bondage
in
the
are
your
ravens
asked
arthur
presently
know
i
have
not
seen
very
much
of
them
for
the
last
week
or
two
they
have
made
a
nest
in
one
of
the
big
trees
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
i
daresay
that
they
are
there
or
perhaps
they
are
hunting
for
their
always
feed
themselves
but
i
will
soon
tell
you
and
she
whistled
in
a
soft
but
penetrating
note
next
minute
there
was
a
swoop
of
wings
and
the
largest
raven
after
hovering
over
her
for
a
minute
lit
upon
her
shoulder
and
rubbed
his
black
head
against
her
face
is
jack
you
see
i
expect
that
jill
is
busy
sitting
on
her
eggs
fly
away
jack
and
look
after
your
she
clapped
her
hands
and
the
great
bird
giving
a
reproachful
croak
spread
his
wings
and
was
gone
have
a
strange
power
over
animals
to
make
those
birds
so
fond
of
you
think
so
it
is
only
because
i
have
living
as
i
do
quite
alone
had
time
to
study
all
their
ways
and
make
friends
of
them
do
you
see
that
thrush
there
i
know
him
well
i
fed
him
during
the
frost
last
winter
if
you
will
stand
back
with
the
dog
you
shall
arthur
hid
himself
behind
a
thick
bush
and
watched
angela
whistled
again
but
in
another
note
with
a
curious
result
not
only
the
thrush
in
question
but
quite
a
dozen
other
birds
of
different
sorts
and
sizes
came
flying
round
her
some
settling
at
her
feet
and
one
a
little
robin
actually
perching
itself
upon
her
hat
presently
she
dismissed
them
as
she
had
done
the
raven
by
clapping
her
hands
and
came
back
to
arthur
the
winter
time
she
said
could
show
you
more
curious
things
than
think
that
you
are
a
witch
said
arthur
who
was
astounded
at
the
sight
she
laughed
as
she
answered
only
witchery
that
i
use
is
chapter
xxiii
pigott
old
nurse
was
by
no
means
sorry
to
hear
of
visit
to
the
abbey
house
though
having
in
her
youth
been
a
servant
in
good
houses
she
was
distressed
at
the
nature
of
his
reception
but
putting
this
aside
she
thought
it
high
time
that
her
darling
should
see
a
young
man
or
two
that
she
might
what
the
world
was
pigott
was
no
believer
in
female
celibacy
and
future
was
a
frequent
subject
of
meditation
with
her
for
she
knew
very
well
that
her
present
mode
of
life
was
scarcely
suited
either
to
her
birth
her
beauty
or
her
capabilities
not
that
she
ever
in
her
highest
flights
imagined
angela
as
a
great
lady
or
one
of
shining
stars
she
loved
to
picture
her
in
some
quiet
happy
home
beloved
by
her
husband
and
surrounded
by
children
as
beautiful
as
herself
it
was
but
a
moderate
ambition
for
one
so
peerlessly
endowed
but
she
would
have
been
glad
to
see
it
fulfilled
for
of
late
years
there
had
sprung
up
in
nurse
mind
an
increasing
dislike
of
her
surroundings
which
sometimes
almost
amounted
to
a
feeling
of
horror
philip
she
had
always
detested
with
his
preoccupied
air
and
uncanny
ways
must
she
would
say
something
wicked
about
a
man
as
is
afraid
to
have
his
own
bonny
daughter
look
him
in
the
face
to
say
nothing
of
his
being
that
mean
as
to
grudge
her
the
clothes
on
her
back
and
make
her
live
worse
nor
a
having
therefore
by
a
quiet
peep
through
the
curtains
ascertained
that
he
was
and
about
the
right
age
pigott
confessed
to
herself
that
she
was
heartily
glad
of
arrival
and
determined
that
should
she
take
to
him
on
further
acquaintance
he
should
find
a
warm
ally
in
her
in
any
advances
he
might
choose
to
make
on
the
fortress
of
affections
do
so
hope
that
you
mind
dining
at
twelve
and
with
my
old
nurse
angela
said
as
they
went
together
up
the
stairs
to
the
room
they
used
as
a
course
i
like
it
really
i
angela
shook
her
head
and
looking
but
partially
convinced
led
the
way
down
the
passage
and
into
the
room
where
to
her
astonishment
she
perceived
that
the
was
furnished
with
a
more
sumptuous
meal
than
she
had
seen
upon
it
for
years
the
fact
being
that
pigott
had
received
orders
from
philip
which
she
did
not
know
of
not
to
spare
expense
whilst
arthur
was
his
guest
waste
reflected
angela
in
whom
the
pressure
of
circumstances
had
developed
an
economical
turn
of
mind
as
she
glanced
at
the
unaccustomed
jug
of
beer
said
he
was
a
a
loud
from
pigott
arresting
her
attention
stopped
all
further
consideration
of
the
matter
that
good
lady
who
in
honour
of
the
occasion
was
dressed
in
a
black
gown
of
a
formidable
character
and
a
cap
was
standing
up
behind
her
chair
waiting
to
be
introduced
to
the
visitor
angela
proceeded
to
go
through
the
ceremony
which
attitude
rendered
rather
trying
this
is
the
gentleman
that
my
father
has
asked
to
stay
with
us
heigham
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
old
nurse
arthur
bowed
politely
whilst
pigott
made
two
obligatory
curtsies
requiring
a
step
backwards
after
each
as
though
to
make
room
for
another
her
speech
too
carefully
prepared
for
the
occasion
is
worthy
of
transcription
she
said
sir
is
a
pleasure
as
i
little
expected
and
i
well
knows
that
it
is
not
what
you
or
the
likes
is
accustomed
to
of
dinners
and
teas
with
old
women
which
i
hopes
sir
how
as
you
will
put
up
with
it
seeing
how
as
the
habits
of
this
house
is
what
might
without
mistake
be
called
peculiar
which
i
says
without
any
offence
to
miss
angela
though
her
has
been
what
i
call
odd
she
knows
it
as
well
as
i
do
which
indeed
is
the
only
consolation
i
has
to
offer
being
right
sure
as
indeed
i
am
how
as
any
young
gentleman
as
ever
breathed
would
sit
in
a
pool
of
water
to
dine
along
with
miss
angela
let
alone
an
old
nurse
i
such
a
fool
as
i
may
look
no
need
for
you
to
go
of
miss
angela
and
now
sir
if
you
please
we
will
sit
down
for
fear
lest
the
gravy
should
begin
to
grease
and
utterly
exhausted
by
the
exuberance
of
her
own
verbosity
she
plunged
into
her
example
which
arthur
bowing
his
acknowledgements
of
her
opening
address
was
not
slow
to
follow
one
of
his
first
acts
was
at
invitation
to
help
himself
to
a
glass
of
beer
of
which
to
speak
truth
he
drank
a
good
deal
angela
watched
the
proceeding
with
interest
she
asked
presently
a
teetotaller
the
recollection
of
his
statement
of
the
previous
day
flashed
into
his
mind
he
was
however
equal
to
the
occasion
teetotaller
he
replied
with
gravity
a
person
who
only
drinks
beer
and
angela
the
apparent
discrepancy
explained
retired
satisfied
that
was
a
very
pleasant
dinner
what
a
thing
it
is
to
be
young
and
in
love
how
it
gilds
the
dull
gingerbread
of
life
what
new
capacities
of
enjoyment
it
opens
up
to
us
and
for
the
matter
of
that
of
pain
also
and
oh
what
stupendous
fools
it
makes
of
us
in
everybody
eyes
except
our
own
and
if
we
are
lucky
those
of
our
adored
the
afternoon
and
evening
passed
much
as
the
morning
had
done
angela
took
arthur
round
the
place
and
showed
him
all
the
spots
connected
with
her
strange
and
lonely
childhood
of
which
she
told
him
many
a
curious
story
in
fact
before
the
day
was
over
he
knew
all
the
history
of
her
innocent
life
and
was
struck
with
amazement
at
the
variety
and
depth
of
her
scholastic
acquirements
and
the
extraordinary
power
of
her
mind
which
combined
with
her
simplicity
and
total
ignorance
of
the
ways
of
the
world
produced
an
effect
as
charming
as
it
was
unusual
needless
to
say
that
every
hour
he
knew
her
he
fell
more
deeply
in
love
with
her
at
length
about
eight
just
as
it
was
beginning
to
get
dark
she
suggested
that
he
should
go
and
sit
a
while
with
her
father
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
arthur
i
am
going
to
read
a
little
and
then
go
to
bed
i
always
go
to
bed
about
nine
and
she
held
out
her
hand
to
say
he
took
it
and
said
then
i
wish
it
were
then
i
should
be
saying
angela
instead
of
angela
may
i
call
you
angela
we
seem
to
know
each
other
so
well
you
of
course
she
laughed
back
i
know
calls
me
angela
so
why
you
will
you
call
me
arthur
everybody
i
know
calls
me
angela
hesitated
and
angela
blushed
though
why
she
hesitated
and
why
she
blushed
was
perhaps
more
than
she
could
have
exactly
said
i
suppose
is
if
you
like
it
it
is
a
pretty
name
arthur
arthur
and
she
was
gone
his
companion
gone
arthur
turned
and
entered
the
house
the
door
was
open
so
he
went
straight
in
philip
who
was
sitting
and
staring
in
an
abstracted
way
at
the
empty
fireplace
with
a
light
behind
him
turned
quickly
round
as
he
heard
the
footstep
you
is
it
heigham
i
suppose
angela
has
gone
upstairs
she
goes
to
roost
very
early
i
hope
that
she
has
not
bored
you
and
that
old
pigott
talked
your
head
off
i
told
you
that
we
were
an
odd
lot
you
know
but
if
you
find
us
odder
than
you
bargained
for
i
should
advise
you
to
clear
you
i
have
spent
a
very
happy
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
you
must
be
easily
satisfied
have
an
arcadian
mind
and
that
sort
of
thing
take
some
whisky
and
light
your
arthur
did
so
and
presently
philip
in
that
tone
of
gentlemanly
ease
which
above
everything
distinguished
him
from
his
cousin
led
the
conversation
round
to
his
prospects
and
affairs
more
especially
his
money
affairs
arthur
answered
him
frankly
enough
but
this
money
talk
had
not
the
same
charms
for
him
that
it
had
for
his
host
indeed
a
marked
repugnance
to
everything
that
had
to
do
with
money
was
one
of
his
characteristics
and
wearied
out
at
length
with
pecuniary
details
and
endless
researches
into
the
mysteries
of
investment
he
took
advantage
of
a
pause
to
attempt
to
change
the
subject
he
said
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
advice
for
i
am
very
ignorant
myself
and
hate
anything
to
do
with
money
i
go
back
to
first
principles
and
believe
that
we
should
all
be
better
without
always
thought
answered
philip
with
a
smile
the
desire
of
money
or
amongst
savage
races
its
equivalent
shells
or
what
not
was
first
principle
of
human
it
really
know
but
i
heartily
wish
that
it
could
be
eliminated
off
the
face
of
the
me
laughed
philip
that
is
the
speech
of
a
very
young
man
why
eliminate
money
and
you
take
away
the
principal
interest
of
life
and
destroy
the
social
fabric
of
the
world
what
is
power
but
money
comfort
social
consideration
ay
and
love
and
health
and
happiness
itself
money
money
money
tell
me
he
went
on
rising
and
addressing
him
with
a
curious
earnestness
god
is
there
more
worthy
of
our
adoration
than
plutus
seeing
that
if
we
worship
him
enough
he
alone
of
the
idols
we
set
in
high
places
will
never
fail
us
at
need
is
a
worship
that
rarely
brings
lasting
happiness
with
it
in
our
greed
to
collect
the
means
of
enjoyment
surely
we
lose
the
power
to
enjoy
that
is
the
cant
of
fools
of
those
who
do
not
know
of
those
who
can
not
feel
but
i
know
and
i
feel
and
i
tell
you
that
it
is
not
so
the
collection
of
those
means
is
in
itself
a
pleasure
because
it
gives
a
consciousness
of
power
talk
to
me
of
fate
that
throwing
the
coin
on
to
the
table
own
seal
you
see
me
for
instance
apparently
poor
and
helpless
a
social
pariah
one
to
be
avoided
and
even
insulted
good
before
long
these
will
right
all
that
for
me
i
shall
by
their
help
be
powerful
and
courted
yet
ay
believe
me
heigham
money
is
a
living
moving
force
leave
it
still
and
it
accumulates
expend
it
and
it
gratifies
every
wish
save
it
and
that
is
best
of
all
and
you
hold
in
your
hand
a
lever
that
will
lift
the
world
i
tell
you
that
there
is
no
height
to
which
it
can
not
bring
you
no
gulf
it
will
not
bridge
soliloquized
arthur
cliffs
of
the
hereafter
his
words
produced
a
curious
effect
eloquence
broke
off
short
and
for
a
moment
a
great
fear
crept
into
his
eyes
silence
ensued
which
neither
of
them
seemed
to
care
to
break
meanwhile
the
wind
suddenly
sprang
up
and
began
to
moan
and
sigh
amongst
the
boughs
of
the
trees
arthur
thought
to
himself
a
very
melancholy
music
presently
philip
laid
his
hand
upon
his
arm
and
he
felt
that
it
shook
like
an
leaf
me
he
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
do
you
see
there
arthur
started
and
followed
the
direction
of
his
eyes
to
the
bare
wall
opposite
the
window
at
that
end
of
the
room
through
which
the
door
was
made
see
he
said
moving
do
they
resemble
know
nothing
in
particular
what
are
they
are
they
hissed
philip
whose
face
was
livid
with
terror
are
the
shades
of
the
dead
sent
here
to
torture
me
look
she
goes
to
meet
him
the
old
man
is
telling
her
now
she
will
wring
her
caresfoot
nonsense
said
arthur
shaking
himself
together
see
nothing
of
the
sort
why
it
is
only
the
shadows
flung
by
the
moonlight
through
the
swinging
boughs
of
that
tree
cut
it
down
and
you
will
have
no
more
writing
upon
your
of
course
you
are
right
heigham
quite
right
ejaculated
his
host
faintly
wiping
the
cold
sweat
from
his
brow
is
nothing
but
the
moonlight
how
ridiculous
of
me
i
suppose
i
am
a
little
out
of
wrong
give
me
some
whisky
a
good
fellow
and
drink
damnation
to
all
the
shadows
and
trees
that
throw
ha
ha
ha
there
was
something
so
uncanny
about
his
manner
and
his
evident
conviction
of
the
origin
of
the
wavering
figures
on
the
wall
which
had
now
disappeared
that
arthur
felt
had
it
not
been
for
angela
he
would
not
be
sorry
to
get
clear
of
him
and
his
shadows
as
soon
as
possible
for
superstition
he
knew
is
as
contagious
as
when
at
length
he
reached
his
great
bare
not
by
the
way
a
comfortable
sort
of
place
to
sleep
in
after
such
an
experience
it
was
only
after
some
hours
in
the
excited
state
of
his
imagination
that
tired
though
he
was
he
could
get
the
rest
he
needed
chapter
xxiv
next
morning
when
they
met
at
their
eight
breakfast
arthur
noticed
that
angela
was
distressed
about
something
is
bad
news
she
said
almost
before
he
greeted
her
cousin
george
is
very
ill
with
typhus
remarked
arthur
rather
coolly
i
must
say
it
does
not
appear
to
distress
you
very
i
say
it
does
to
be
honest
i
detest
your
cousin
and
i
care
if
he
is
ill
or
not
as
she
appeared
to
have
no
reply
ready
the
subject
then
dropped
after
breakfast
angela
proposed
that
they
should
the
day
was
again
the
top
of
a
hill
about
a
mile
away
whence
a
view
of
the
surrounding
country
could
be
obtained
he
consented
and
on
the
way
told
her
of
his
curious
experiences
with
her
father
on
the
previous
night
she
listened
attentively
and
when
he
had
finished
shook
her
head
is
she
said
about
my
father
that
separates
him
from
everybody
else
his
life
never
comes
out
into
the
sunlight
of
the
passing
day
it
always
gropes
along
in
the
shadow
of
some
gloomy
past
what
the
mystery
is
that
envelops
him
i
neither
know
nor
care
to
inquire
but
i
am
sure
that
there
is
do
you
explain
the
shadows
believe
your
explanation
is
right
they
are
under
certain
conditions
of
light
thrown
by
a
tree
that
grows
some
distance
off
i
have
seen
something
that
looks
like
figures
on
that
wall
myself
in
full
daylight
that
he
should
interpret
such
a
simple
thing
as
he
does
shows
a
curious
state
of
do
not
think
then
said
arthur
in
order
to
draw
her
out
it
is
possible
after
all
he
was
right
and
that
they
were
something
from
another
place
the
reality
of
his
terror
was
almost
enough
to
make
one
believe
in
them
i
can
tell
i
do
not
answered
angela
after
a
thought
have
no
doubt
that
the
veil
between
ourselves
and
the
unseen
world
is
thinner
than
we
think
i
believe
too
that
communication
and
even
warnings
sometimes
under
favourable
conditions
or
when
the
veil
is
worn
thin
by
trouble
or
prayer
can
pass
from
the
other
world
to
ourselves
but
the
very
fact
of
my
terror
proves
to
me
that
his
shadows
are
nothing
of
the
sort
for
it
is
hardly
possible
that
spirits
can
be
permitted
to
come
to
terrify
us
poor
mortals
if
they
come
at
all
it
is
in
love
and
gentleness
to
comfort
or
to
warn
and
not
to
work
upon
our
speak
as
though
you
knew
all
about
it
you
should
join
the
new
ghost
society
he
answered
irreverently
sitting
himself
down
on
a
fallen
tree
an
example
that
she
followed
have
thought
about
it
sometimes
that
is
all
and
so
far
as
i
have
read
i
think
that
my
belief
is
a
common
one
and
what
the
bible
teaches
us
but
if
you
will
not
think
me
foolish
i
will
tell
you
something
that
confirms
me
in
it
you
know
that
my
mother
died
when
i
was
born
well
it
may
seem
strange
to
you
but
i
am
convinced
that
she
is
sometimes
very
near
you
mean
that
you
see
or
hear
her
i
only
feel
her
presence
more
rarely
now
i
am
sorry
to
say
as
i
grow
do
you
mean
can
hardly
explain
what
i
mean
but
may
be
at
night
or
when
i
am
sitting
alone
in
the
great
calm
comes
upon
me
and
i
am
a
changed
woman
all
my
thoughts
rise
into
a
higher
purer
air
and
are
as
it
were
tinged
with
a
reflected
light
everything
earthly
seems
to
pass
away
from
me
and
i
feel
as
though
fetters
had
fallen
from
my
soul
and
i
that
i
am
near
my
mother
then
everything
passes
and
i
am
left
myself
what
are
the
thoughts
you
have
at
these
times
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
they
pass
away
with
her
who
brought
them
leaving
nothing
but
a
vague
in
my
mind
like
that
in
the
sky
after
the
sun
has
set
but
now
look
at
the
view
is
it
not
beautiful
in
the
sunlight
all
the
world
seems
to
be
angela
was
right
the
view
was
charming
below
lay
the
thatched
roofs
of
the
little
village
of
bratham
and
to
the
right
the
waters
of
the
lake
shone
like
silver
in
the
glancing
sunlight
whilst
the
gables
of
the
old
house
peeping
out
from
amongst
the
budding
foliage
looked
very
picturesque
the
spring
had
cast
her
green
garment
over
the
land
from
every
copse
rang
out
the
melody
of
birds
and
the
gentle
breeze
was
heavy
with
the
scent
of
the
unnumbered
violets
that
starred
the
mossy
carpet
at
their
feet
in
the
fields
where
grew
the
wheat
and
clover
now
springing
into
lusty
life
the
busy
weeders
were
at
work
and
on
the
warm
brown
fallows
the
sower
went
forth
to
sow
from
the
early
pastures
beneath
where
purled
a
little
brook
there
came
a
pleasant
lowing
of
kine
with
the
new
grass
and
a
cheerful
bleating
of
lambs
to
whom
as
yet
life
was
nothing
but
one
long
skip
it
was
a
charming
scene
and
its
influence
sank
deep
into
the
hearts
is
depressing
to
think
said
arthur
rather
sententiously
but
really
chiefly
with
the
object
of
getting
at
his
views
all
this
can
not
last
but
is
as
it
were
like
ourselves
under
sentence
of
rose
and
fell
and
fleeted
upon
troubled
sea
a
wave
that
swells
to
vanish
into
eternity
oh
mystery
and
wonder
of
wings
that
can
not
fly
of
ears
that
can
not
hearken
of
life
that
di
e
quoth
angela
by
way
of
comment
lines
are
those
asked
arthur
know
own
she
said
shyly
is
they
are
a
translation
of
a
verse
of
a
greek
ode
i
wrote
for
fraser
i
will
say
you
the
original
if
you
like
i
think
it
better
than
the
translation
and
i
believe
that
it
is
fair
you
thank
you
miss
i
am
quite
satisfied
with
your
english
version
you
positively
alarm
me
angela
most
people
are
quite
content
if
they
can
put
a
poem
written
in
english
into
greek
you
reverse
the
process
and
having
coolly
given
expression
to
your
thoughts
in
greek
condescend
to
translate
them
into
your
native
tongue
i
only
wish
you
had
been
at
cambridge
do
they
call
the
place
it
would
have
been
a
joke
to
see
you
come
out
she
broke
in
blushing
are
like
fraser
you
overrate
my
acquirements
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
am
not
the
perfect
scholar
you
think
me
and
about
most
things
i
am
shockingly
ignorant
i
should
indeed
be
silly
if
after
ten
patient
work
under
such
a
scholar
as
fraser
i
did
not
know
some
classics
and
mathematics
why
do
you
know
for
the
last
three
years
that
we
worked
together
we
used
as
a
rule
to
carry
on
our
ordinary
conversations
during
work
in
latin
and
greek
month
and
month
about
sometimes
with
the
funniest
results
one
never
knows
how
little
one
does
know
of
a
dead
language
till
one
tries
to
talk
it
just
try
to
speak
in
latin
for
the
next
five
minutes
and
you
will
you
i
am
not
going
to
expose
my
ignorance
for
your
amusement
she
laughed
she
said
is
you
who
wish
to
amuse
yourself
at
my
expense
by
trying
to
make
me
believe
that
i
am
a
great
scholar
but
what
i
was
going
to
say
before
you
attacked
me
about
my
fancied
acquirements
was
that
in
my
opinion
your
remark
about
the
whole
world
being
under
sentence
of
death
was
rather
a
morbid
it
is
obviously
in
a
sense
but
to
my
mind
this
scene
speaks
more
of
resurrection
than
of
death
look
at
the
earth
pushing
up
her
flowers
and
the
dead
trees
breaking
into
beauty
there
is
no
sign
of
death
there
but
rather
of
a
renewed
and
glorified
but
there
is
still
the
awful
of
death
to
face
nature
herself
has
been
temporarily
dead
before
she
blooms
into
beauty
she
dies
every
autumn
to
rise
again
in
the
same
form
every
spring
but
how
do
we
know
in
what
form
shall
emerge
from
the
chrysalis
as
soon
as
a
man
begins
to
think
at
all
he
stands
face
to
face
with
this
hideous
problem
to
the
solution
of
which
he
knows
himself
to
be
drawing
daily
nearer
his
position
i
often
think
is
worse
than
that
of
a
criminal
under
sentence
because
the
criminal
is
only
being
deprived
of
the
employment
of
a
term
indefinite
indeed
but
absolutely
limited
but
man
at
large
does
not
know
of
what
he
is
deprived
and
what
he
must
inherit
in
the
aeons
that
await
him
it
is
the
uncertainty
of
death
that
is
its
most
dreadful
part
and
with
that
hanging
over
our
race
the
wonder
to
me
is
not
only
that
we
for
the
most
part
put
the
subject
entirely
out
of
mind
but
that
we
can
ever
think
seriously
of
anything
remember
answered
angela
thinking
very
much
in
the
same
way
and
i
went
to
fraser
for
advice
bible
he
said
satisfy
your
doubts
and
fears
if
only
you
will
read
it
in
a
right
and
indeed
more
or
less
it
did
i
can
not
of
course
venture
to
advise
you
but
i
pass
his
advice
on
it
is
that
of
a
very
good
you
then
no
dread
of
death
or
rather
of
what
lies
beyond
it
she
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
with
something
of
wonder
in
them
why
she
said
i
who
am
immortal
fear
a
change
that
i
know
has
no
power
to
harm
me
that
can
on
the
contrary
only
bring
me
nearer
to
the
purpose
of
my
being
certainly
i
shrink
from
death
itself
as
we
all
must
but
of
the
dangers
beyond
i
have
no
fear
pleasant
as
this
world
is
at
times
there
is
something
in
us
all
that
strives
to
rise
above
it
and
if
i
knew
that
i
must
die
within
this
hour
i
that
i
could
meet
my
fate
without
a
qualm
i
am
sure
that
when
our
trembling
hands
have
drawn
the
veil
from
death
we
shall
find
his
features
passionless
indeed
but
very
arthur
looked
at
her
with
astonishment
wondering
what
manner
of
woman
this
could
be
who
in
the
first
flush
of
youth
and
beauty
could
face
the
great
unknown
without
a
tremor
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
with
something
of
envious
bitterness
it
is
very
well
for
you
whose
life
has
been
so
pure
and
free
from
evil
but
it
is
different
for
me
with
all
my
consciousness
of
sins
and
imperfections
for
me
and
thousands
like
me
strive
as
we
will
immortality
has
terrors
as
well
as
hopes
it
is
and
always
will
be
human
to
fear
the
future
for
human
nature
never
changes
you
know
the
lines
in
it
is
the
dread
of
something
after
death
the
undiscovered
country
from
whose
bourn
no
traveller
returns
the
will
and
makes
us
rather
bear
those
ills
we
have
than
fly
to
others
that
we
know
not
of
thus
conscience
does
make
cowards
of
us
are
true
and
while
men
last
they
always
will
be
arthur
she
answered
earnestly
and
for
the
first
time
addressing
him
in
conversation
by
his
christian
name
limited
your
trust
must
be
in
the
mercy
of
a
creator
whose
mercy
is
as
wide
as
the
ocean
that
you
can
talk
like
that
you
speak
of
me
too
as
better
than
am
i
better
i
have
my
bad
thoughts
and
do
bad
things
as
much
as
you
and
though
they
may
not
be
the
same
i
am
sure
they
are
quite
as
black
as
yours
since
everybody
must
be
responsible
according
to
their
characters
and
temptations
i
try
however
to
trust
in
god
to
cover
my
sins
and
believe
that
if
i
do
my
best
he
will
forgive
me
that
is
all
but
i
have
no
business
to
preach
to
you
who
are
older
and
wiser
than
i
he
broke
in
laying
his
hand
involuntarily
upon
her
own
i
have
never
spoken
of
them
to
any
one
before
and
could
not
speak
of
them
to
anybody
but
these
things
weigh
upon
my
mind
you
would
not
say
that
but
would
try
to
teach
me
your
can
i
teach
you
arthur
when
i
have
so
much
to
learn
myself
she
answered
simply
and
from
that
moment
though
she
did
not
know
it
as
yet
she
loved
him
this
very
curious
one
arthur
thought
to
himself
afterwards
for
two
young
people
on
a
spring
come
to
an
end
nothing
more
was
said
for
some
while
and
they
took
their
way
down
the
hill
varying
the
route
in
order
to
pass
through
the
little
hamlet
of
bratham
under
a
that
stood
upon
the
village
green
arthur
noticed
a
village
blacksmith
but
a
small
crowd
mostly
composed
of
children
gathered
round
somebody
on
going
to
see
who
it
was
he
discovered
a
old
man
with
an
intellectual
face
and
the
remnants
of
a
gentlemanlike
appearance
playing
on
the
violin
a
very
few
touches
of
his
bow
told
arthur
who
knew
something
of
music
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
a
performer
of
no
mean
merit
seeing
the
quality
of
his
two
auditors
and
that
they
appreciated
his
performance
the
player
changed
his
music
and
from
a
village
jig
passed
to
one
of
the
more
difficult
opera
airs
which
he
executed
in
brilliant
fashion
cried
arthur
as
the
last
notes
thrilled
and
died
away
see
you
understand
how
to
play
the
sir
and
so
i
should
for
i
have
played
first
violin
at
her
opera
before
now
name
what
you
like
and
i
will
play
it
you
or
if
you
like
it
better
you
shall
hear
the
water
running
in
a
brook
the
wind
passing
through
the
trees
or
the
waves
falling
on
the
beach
only
say
the
arthur
thought
for
a
moment
is
a
beautiful
day
let
us
have
a
us
the
music
of
a
the
old
man
considered
a
while
understand
but
you
set
a
difficult
subject
even
for
me
and
taking
up
his
bow
he
made
several
attempts
at
beginning
do
it
he
said
something
no
try
again
that
or
again
he
started
and
this
time
his
genius
took
possession
of
him
the
notes
fell
very
softly
at
first
but
with
an
ominous
sound
then
rose
and
wailed
like
the
rising
of
the
wind
next
the
music
came
in
gusts
the
rain
pattered
and
the
thunder
roared
till
at
length
the
tempest
seemed
to
spend
its
force
and
pass
slowly
away
into
the
distance
sir
what
do
you
say
to
i
fulfilled
your
expectations
it
down
and
it
will
be
one
of
the
finest
pieces
of
violin
music
in
the
it
down
the
divine
is
not
to
be
caged
sir
it
comes
and
goes
i
could
never
write
that
music
arthur
felt
in
his
pocket
without
answering
and
found
five
shillings
you
will
accept
this
he
said
you
sir
very
much
i
am
gladder
of
five
shillings
now
than
i
once
was
of
as
many
pounds
and
he
rose
to
go
man
of
your
talent
should
not
be
wandering
about
like
must
earn
a
living
somehow
for
all
witticism
to
the
contrary
was
the
curious
answer
you
no
friends
sir
this
is
my
only
friend
all
the
rest
have
deserted
me
and
he
tapped
his
violin
and
was
gone
sir
said
a
farmer
who
was
standing
by
gone
to
get
drunk
he
is
the
biggest
old
drunkard
in
the
countryside
and
yet
they
do
say
he
was
gentleman
once
and
the
best
fiddler
in
london
but
he
be
depended
on
so
no
one
will
hire
him
sad
said
angela
as
they
moved
homewards
and
what
music
that
was
i
never
heard
any
with
such
imagination
before
you
have
a
turn
that
way
angela
you
should
try
to
put
it
into
words
it
would
make
a
complain
like
the
old
man
that
you
set
a
difficult
subject
she
said
i
will
try
if
you
will
promise
not
to
laugh
at
the
you
succeed
on
paper
only
half
so
well
as
he
did
on
the
violin
your
verses
will
be
worth
listening
to
and
i
certainly
shall
not
chapter
xxv
on
the
following
day
the
somewhat
curious
religious
conversation
between
arthur
and
conversation
which
begun
on
part
out
of
curiosity
had
ended
on
both
sides
very
much
in
the
weather
broke
up
and
the
grand
old
english
climate
reasserted
its
treacherous
supremacy
from
summer
weather
the
inhabitants
of
the
county
of
marlshire
suddenly
found
themselves
plunged
into
a
spell
of
cold
that
was
by
contrast
almost
arctic
storms
of
sleet
drove
against
the
and
there
was
even
a
very
damaging
while
that
dreadful
scourge
which
nobody
in
his
senses
except
kingsley
ever
have
liked
the
east
wind
literally
pervaded
the
whole
place
and
went
whistling
through
the
surrounding
trees
and
ruins
in
a
way
calculated
to
make
even
a
laplander
shiver
under
these
cheerless
circumstances
our
pair
of
as
yet
they
were
ostensibly
at
any
rate
nothing
up
their
outdoor
excursions
and
took
to
rambling
over
the
disused
rooms
in
the
old
house
and
hunting
up
many
a
record
some
of
them
valuable
and
curious
enough
of
caresfoots
and
even
of
the
old
priors
before
them
a
splendidly
illuminated
missal
being
amongst
the
latter
prizes
when
this
amusement
was
exhausted
they
sat
together
over
the
fire
in
the
nursery
and
angela
translated
to
him
from
her
favourite
classical
authors
especially
homer
with
an
ease
and
fluency
of
expression
that
to
arthur
was
little
short
of
miraculous
or
when
they
got
tired
of
that
he
read
to
her
from
standard
writers
which
elaborate
as
her
education
had
been
in
certain
respects
she
had
scarcely
yet
even
opened
notably
shakespeare
and
milton
needless
to
say
herself
imbued
with
a
strong
poetic
feeling
these
immortal
writers
were
a
source
of
intense
delight
to
her
is
it
that
fraser
never
gave
you
shakespeare
to
read
asked
arthur
one
day
as
he
shut
up
the
volume
having
come
to
the
end
of
said
that
i
should
be
better
able
to
appreciate
it
when
my
mind
had
been
prepared
to
do
so
by
the
help
of
a
classical
and
mathematical
education
and
that
it
would
be
mistake
to
cloy
my
mental
palate
with
sweets
before
i
had
learnt
to
appreciate
their
is
some
sense
in
that
remarked
arthur
the
way
how
are
the
verses
you
promised
to
write
me
getting
on
have
you
done
them
yet
have
done
something
she
answered
modestly
i
really
do
not
think
that
they
are
worth
producing
it
is
very
tiresome
of
you
to
have
remembered
about
arthur
however
by
this
time
knew
enough
of
abilities
to
be
sure
that
her
would
be
something
more
or
less
worth
hearing
and
mildly
insisted
on
their
production
and
then
to
her
confusion
on
her
reading
them
aloud
they
ran
as
follows
and
whatever
opinion
of
them
may
have
been
the
reader
shall
judge
of
them
for
himself
a
storm
on
the
strings
minstrel
sat
in
his
lonely
room
its
walls
were
bare
and
the
twilight
grey
fell
and
crept
and
gathered
to
gloom
it
came
like
the
ghost
of
the
dying
day
and
the
chords
fell
hushed
and
low
pianissimo
arm
was
raised
and
the
violin
quivered
and
shook
with
the
strain
it
bore
while
the
swelling
forth
of
the
sounds
within
rose
with
a
sweetness
unknown
before
and
the
chords
fell
soft
and
low
piano
first
cold
flap
of
the
wings
clashed
with
the
silence
before
the
storm
the
raindrops
pattered
across
the
strings
as
the
gathering
took
drip
drop
high
and
low
staccato
rolling
the
thunder
roared
sudden
and
jagged
the
lightning
played
faster
and
faster
the
raindrops
poured
sobbing
and
surging
the
swayed
cracking
and
crashing
above
below
crescendo
wind
tore
howling
across
the
wold
and
tangled
his
train
in
the
groaning
trees
wrapped
the
dense
clouds
in
his
mantle
cold
then
shivered
and
died
in
a
wailing
breeze
whistling
and
weeping
high
and
low
sostenuto
pale
sun
broke
from
the
driving
cloud
and
flashed
in
the
raindrops
serenely
cool
at
the
touch
of
his
finger
the
forest
bowed
as
it
shimmered
and
glanced
in
the
ruffled
pool
while
the
rustling
leaves
soughed
soft
and
low
gracioso
was
only
a
dream
on
the
throbbing
strings
an
echo
of
nature
in
phantasy
wrought
a
breath
of
her
breath
and
a
touch
of
her
wings
from
a
kingdom
outspread
in
the
regions
of
thought
below
rolled
the
sound
of
the
din
and
the
fading
day
as
the
night
drew
in
showed
the
quaint
old
face
and
the
pointed
chin
and
the
arm
that
was
raised
the
violin
as
the
old
man
whispered
his
dead
tale
to
the
friend
who
could
comfort
though
others
might
fail
and
the
chords
stole
hushed
and
low
pianissimo
he
stopped
and
the
sheet
of
paper
fell
from
his
hands
she
said
with
all
the
eagerness
of
a
writer
me
do
you
think
them
bad
angela
you
go
on
now
i
am
ready
to
be
crushed
pray
spare
my
was
about
to
say
that
thanks
be
to
providence
i
am
not
a
critic
but
i
yes
let
me
hear
what
you
think
you
are
speaking
so
slowly
in
order
to
get
time
to
invent
something
extra
cutting
well
i
deserve
interrupt
i
was
going
to
say
that
i
think
the
piece
above
the
average
of
poetry
and
that
a
few
of
the
lines
touch
the
standard
you
have
caught
something
of
the
that
the
drunken
old
fellow
said
he
could
not
cage
but
i
do
not
think
that
you
will
ever
be
popular
as
a
writer
of
verses
if
you
keep
to
that
style
i
doubt
if
there
is
a
magazine
in
the
kingdom
that
would
take
those
lines
unless
they
were
by
a
known
writer
they
would
return
them
marked
but
too
vague
for
the
general
magazine
editors
like
lines
from
kingdom
outspread
in
the
regions
of
thought
for
as
they
say
such
poems
are
apt
to
excite
vagueness
in
the
brains
of
that
dim
entity
the
what
they
do
like
are
commonplace
ideas
put
in
pretty
language
and
sweetened
with
sentimentality
or
emotional
religious
feelings
such
as
the
thinking
powers
of
their
subscribers
are
competent
to
absorb
without
mental
strain
and
without
leaving
their
accustomed
channels
to
be
popular
it
is
necessary
to
be
commonplace
or
at
the
least
to
describe
the
commonplace
to
work
in
a
groove
and
not
to
which
unfortunately
simple
as
they
seem
very
few
persons
possess
the
art
of
acting
up
to
see
what
happens
to
the
unfortunate
novelist
for
instance
who
dares
to
break
the
unwritten
law
and
defraud
his
readers
of
the
orthodox
transformation
scene
of
the
reward
of
virtue
and
the
discomfiture
of
vice
or
to
make
his
creation
finish
up
in
a
way
that
however
well
it
may
be
suited
to
its
tenor
or
illustrate
its
more
subtle
meaning
is
contrary
to
the
idea
as
to
how
it
should
as
it
is
called
he
simply
collapses
to
rise
no
more
if
he
is
new
at
the
trade
and
if
he
is
a
known
man
that
book
talk
quite
feelingly
said
angela
who
was
getting
rather
bored
and
wanted
not
unnaturally
to
hear
more
about
her
own
lines
replied
arthur
grimly
do
once
i
was
fool
enough
to
write
a
book
but
i
must
tell
you
that
it
is
a
painful
subject
with
me
it
never
came
out
nobody
would
have
arthur
i
am
so
sorry
i
should
like
to
read
your
book
but
as
regards
the
verses
i
am
glad
that
you
like
them
and
i
really
care
what
a
hypothetical
general
public
would
say
i
wrote
them
to
please
you
not
the
general
my
dear
i
am
sure
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
i
shall
value
them
doubly
once
for
the
sake
and
once
for
their
angela
blushed
but
did
not
reprove
the
term
of
endearment
which
had
slipped
unawares
from
his
lips
poetry
is
a
dangerous
subject
between
two
young
people
who
at
heart
adore
one
another
it
is
apt
to
excite
the
brain
and
bring
about
startling
revelations
the
following
day
the
reading
of
piece
of
poetry
was
rendered
remarkable
by
two
events
of
which
the
first
was
that
the
weather
suddenly
turned
a
somersault
and
became
beautifully
warm
and
the
second
that
news
reached
the
abbey
house
that
thanks
chiefly
to
lady
devoted
fearless
of
infection
had
to
the
great
admiration
of
all
her
neighbours
volunteered
her
services
when
no
nurse
could
be
found
to
undertake
the
was
pronounced
out
of
danger
this
piece
of
news
was
peculiarly
grateful
to
philip
for
had
his
cousin
died
the
estates
must
have
passed
away
for
ever
under
the
terms
of
his
will
for
he
knew
that
george
had
made
none
angela
too
tried
like
a
good
girl
as
she
was
to
lash
herself
into
enthusiasm
about
it
though
in
her
heart
she
went
as
near
hating
her
cousin
since
his
attempted
indignity
towards
herself
as
her
gentle
nature
would
allow
arthur
alone
was
cynically
indifferent
he
hated
george
without
any
reservation
whatsoever
and
after
this
there
came
for
our
pair
of
embryo
lovers
some
ten
or
twelve
such
happy
days
for
there
was
no
talk
of
departure
philip
having
on
several
occasions
pointedly
told
him
that
the
house
was
at
his
disposal
for
as
long
as
he
chose
to
remain
in
it
the
sky
was
blue
in
those
days
or
only
flecked
with
summer
clouds
just
as
arthur
and
perfect
companionship
was
flecked
and
shaded
with
the
deeper
hues
of
dawning
passion
alas
the
sky
in
this
terrestrial
clime
is
never
blue
but
as
yet
nothing
of
love
had
passed
between
them
no
kiss
or
word
of
endearment
only
when
hand
touched
hand
a
strange
thrill
had
moved
them
both
and
sent
the
warm
blood
to
stain
clear
brow
like
a
wavering
tint
of
sunlight
thrown
upon
the
marble
features
of
some
white
venus
only
in
each
eyes
they
found
a
holy
mystery
the
spell
was
not
yet
fully
at
work
but
the
wand
of
great
enchanter
had
touched
them
and
they
were
changed
angela
is
hardly
the
same
girl
she
was
when
we
met
her
a
little
more
than
a
fortnight
back
a
nameless
change
has
come
over
her
face
and
manner
the
merry
smile
once
so
bright
has
grown
softer
and
more
sweet
and
the
laughing
light
of
her
grey
eyes
has
given
place
to
a
look
of
some
such
gratitude
and
wonder
as
that
with
which
the
traveller
in
lonely
deserts
gazes
on
the
oasis
of
his
perfect
rest
many
times
arthur
had
almost
blurted
out
the
truth
to
the
woman
he
passionately
adored
and
every
day
so
added
to
the
suppressed
fire
of
his
love
that
at
length
he
felt
that
he
could
not
keep
his
secret
to
himself
much
longer
and
yet
he
feared
to
tell
it
better
he
thought
to
live
happy
if
in
doubt
than
to
risk
all
his
fortune
on
a
single
throw
for
before
his
eyes
there
lay
the
black
dread
of
failure
and
then
what
would
life
be
worth
here
with
angela
he
lived
in
a
garden
of
eden
that
no
forebodings
no
anxieties
no
fear
of
that
partially
scotched
serpent
george
could
render
wretched
so
long
as
it
was
gladdened
by
the
presence
of
her
whom
he
hoped
to
make
his
eve
but
without
and
around
where
she
could
not
be
there
was
nothing
but
clods
and
thistles
and
a
black
desolation
that
even
in
imagination
he
dared
not
face
and
angela
gazing
on
veiled
mysteries
with
wondering
eyes
was
she
happy
during
those
days
almost
but
still
there
was
in
her
heart
a
consciousness
of
effort
a
sense
of
transformation
and
knowledge
of
the
growth
of
hidden
things
the
bud
bursting
into
the
glory
of
the
rose
must
if
there
be
feeling
in
a
rose
undergo
some
such
effort
before
it
can
make
its
beauty
known
the
butterfly
but
newly
freed
from
the
dull
husk
that
hid
its
splendours
at
first
must
feel
the
imperfect
wings
it
stretches
in
the
sun
to
be
irksome
to
its
unaccustomed
sense
and
so
it
was
with
angela
she
spread
her
grown
wings
in
the
sun
of
her
new
existence
and
found
them
strange
not
knowing
as
yet
that
they
were
shaped
to
bear
her
to
the
crowned
heights
of
love
hers
was
one
of
those
rare
natures
in
which
the
passion
that
we
know
by
the
generic
term
of
love
approached
as
near
perfection
as
is
possible
in
our
human
hearts
for
there
are
many
sorts
and
divisions
of
love
ranging
from
the
affection
pure
steady
and
divine
that
is
showered
upon
us
from
above
to
the
degrading
madness
of
such
a
one
as
george
caresfoot
it
is
surely
one
of
the
saddest
evidences
of
our
poor
humanity
that
even
among
the
purest
of
us
there
are
none
who
can
altogether
rid
the
whiteness
of
the
love
they
have
to
offer
of
its
earthly
stain
indeed
if
we
could
so
far
conquer
the
promptings
of
our
nature
as
to
love
with
perfect
purity
we
should
become
like
angels
but
just
as
white
flowers
are
sometimes
to
be
found
on
the
blackest
peak
so
there
do
bloom
in
the
world
spirits
as
pure
as
they
are
free
from
evil
so
closely
shadowed
by
the
almighty
wing
that
they
can
almost
reach
to
this
perfection
then
the
love
they
have
to
give
is
too
refined
too
holy
and
strong
to
be
understood
of
the
mass
of
men
often
it
is
squandered
on
some
unequal
and
unanswering
nature
sometimes
it
is
wisely
offered
up
to
him
from
whom
it
came
we
gaze
upon
an
river
and
there
is
nothing
to
tell
us
that
beneath
that
white
cloak
its
current
rushes
to
the
ocean
but
presently
the
spring
comes
the
prisoned
waters
burst
their
fetters
and
we
see
a
glad
torrent
sparkling
in
the
sunlight
and
so
it
was
with
our
heart
the
breath
of
passion
and
the
light
of
eyes
had
beat
upon
it
and
almost
freed
the
river
of
its
love
already
the
listener
might
hear
the
crack
and
start
soon
they
will
be
gone
and
her
deep
devotion
will
set
as
strong
towards
him
as
the
tide
of
the
torrent
towards
its
receiving
sea
writing
perhaps
the
reader
will
say
but
surely
none
too
fine
to
describe
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
this
strange
world
the
irrevocable
gift
of
a
good
love
however
that
may
be
it
will
have
served
its
purpose
if
it
makes
it
clear
that
a
crisis
is
at
hand
in
the
affairs
of
the
heart
of
two
of
the
central
actors
on
this
mimic
stage
chapter
xxvi
one
saturday
morning
when
may
was
gone
philip
announced
his
intention
of
going
up
to
london
till
the
monday
on
business
he
was
a
man
who
had
long
since
become
callous
to
appearances
and
though
arthur
fearful
lest
spiteful
things
should
be
said
of
angela
almost
hinted
that
it
would
look
odd
his
host
merely
laughed
and
said
that
he
had
little
doubt
but
that
his
daughter
was
quite
able
to
look
after
herself
even
when
such
a
fascinating
young
gentleman
as
himself
was
concerned
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
object
was
to
get
rid
of
angela
by
marrying
her
to
this
young
heigham
who
had
so
opportunely
tumbled
down
from
the
skies
and
whom
he
rather
liked
than
otherwise
this
being
the
case
he
rightly
concluded
that
the
more
the
two
were
left
together
the
greater
probability
there
was
of
his
object
being
attained
accordingly
he
left
them
together
as
much
as
possible
it
was
on
the
evening
of
this
saturday
that
arthur
gathered
up
his
courage
and
asked
angela
to
come
and
walk
through
the
ruins
with
him
angela
hesitated
a
little
the
shadow
of
something
about
to
happen
had
fallen
on
her
mind
but
the
extraordinary
beauty
of
the
evening
to
say
nothing
of
the
prospect
of
his
company
turned
the
scale
in
favour
it
was
one
of
those
nights
of
which
if
we
are
lucky
we
get
some
five
or
six
in
the
course
of
an
english
summer
the
moon
was
at
her
full
and
the
twilight
ended
she
filled
the
heavens
with
her
light
every
twig
and
blade
of
grass
showed
out
as
clearly
as
in
the
day
but
looked
like
frosted
silver
the
silence
was
intense
and
so
still
was
the
air
that
the
sharp
shadows
of
the
trees
were
motionless
upon
the
grass
only
growing
with
the
growing
hours
it
was
one
of
those
nights
that
fill
us
with
an
indescribable
emotion
bringing
us
into
closer
companionship
with
the
unseen
than
ever
does
the
garish
busy
day
in
such
an
hour
we
can
sometimes
feel
or
think
that
we
can
feel
other
presences
around
us
and
involuntarily
we
listen
for
the
whisper
of
the
wings
and
the
voices
of
our
beloved
on
this
particular
evening
some
such
feeling
was
stirring
in
heart
as
with
slow
steps
she
led
the
way
into
the
little
village
churchyard
a
similar
spot
to
that
which
is
to
be
found
in
many
a
country
parish
except
that
the
population
being
very
small
there
were
but
few
recent
graves
most
of
the
mounds
had
no
to
recall
the
names
of
the
neglected
dead
but
here
and
there
were
dotted
discoloured
slabs
some
sunk
a
foot
or
two
into
the
soil
a
few
lying
prone
upon
it
and
the
remainder
thrown
by
the
gradual
subsidence
of
their
supports
into
every
variety
of
angle
as
though
they
had
been
suddenly
halted
in
the
maddest
whirl
of
a
grotesque
dance
of
death
picking
her
way
through
these
angela
stopped
under
an
ancient
yew
and
pointing
to
one
of
the
two
shadowed
mounds
to
which
the
moonlight
scarcely
struggled
said
in
a
low
voice
is
my
it
was
a
modest
tenement
enough
a
little
heap
of
close
green
turf
surrounded
by
a
railing
and
planted
with
and
at
its
head
was
placed
a
white
marble
cross
on
which
arthur
could
just
distinguish
the
words
caresfoot
and
the
date
of
death
he
was
about
to
speak
but
she
stopped
him
with
a
gentle
movement
and
then
stepping
forward
to
the
head
of
the
railing
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
remained
motionless
arthur
watched
her
with
curiosity
what
he
wondered
was
passing
in
the
mind
of
this
strange
and
beautiful
woman
who
had
grown
up
so
sweet
and
pure
amidst
moral
desolation
like
a
white
lily
blooming
alone
on
the
black
african
plains
in
winter
suddenly
she
raised
her
head
and
saw
the
inquiring
look
he
bent
upon
her
she
came
towards
him
and
in
that
sweet
pleading
voice
which
was
one
of
her
greatest
charms
she
said
fear
you
think
me
very
foolish
should
i
think
you
foolish
i
have
come
here
at
night
to
stand
before
a
do
not
think
you
foolish
indeed
i
was
only
wondering
what
was
passing
in
your
angela
hung
her
head
and
made
no
answer
and
the
clock
above
them
boomed
out
the
hour
raising
its
sullen
note
in
insolent
defiance
of
the
silence
what
is
it
that
is
so
solemn
about
the
striking
of
the
when
one
stands
in
a
churchyard
at
night
is
it
that
the
hour
softens
our
natures
and
makes
them
more
amenable
to
superstitious
influences
or
is
it
that
the
thousand
evidences
of
departed
mortality
which
surround
us
appealing
with
dumb
force
to
natural
fears
throw
open
for
a
space
the
gates
of
our
imagination
to
tenant
its
vast
halls
with
prophetic
echoes
of
our
end
perhaps
it
is
useless
to
inquire
the
result
remains
the
same
few
of
us
can
hear
those
tones
at
night
without
a
qualm
and
did
we
put
our
thoughts
into
words
they
would
run
something
thus
sound
once
broke
upon
the
living
ears
of
those
who
sleep
around
us
we
hear
it
now
in
a
little
while
hour
after
hour
it
will
echo
against
the
tombstones
of
graves
and
new
generations
coming
out
of
the
silent
future
will
stand
where
we
stand
and
hearken
and
muse
as
we
mused
over
the
old
problems
that
we
have
gone
to
solve
whilst
we
not
be
deaf
to
hear
and
dumb
to
utter
such
at
any
rate
were
the
unspoken
thoughts
that
crept
into
the
hearts
of
arthur
and
angela
as
the
full
sound
from
the
belfry
thinned
itself
away
into
silence
she
grew
a
little
pale
and
glanced
at
him
and
he
gave
an
involuntary
shiver
while
even
the
dog
aleck
sniffed
and
whined
uncomfortably
feels
cold
he
said
we
go
they
turned
and
walked
towards
the
gate
and
by
the
time
they
reached
it
all
superstitious
thoughts
had
any
rate
from
mind
for
he
recollected
that
he
had
set
himself
a
task
to
do
and
that
now
would
be
the
time
to
do
it
absorbed
in
this
reflection
he
forgot
his
politeness
and
passed
first
through
the
turnstile
on
the
further
side
he
paused
and
looked
earnestly
into
his
face
their
eyes
met
and
there
was
that
in
his
that
caused
her
to
swiftly
drop
her
own
a
silence
ensued
as
they
stood
by
the
gate
he
broke
it
is
a
lovely
night
let
us
walk
through
the
shall
wet
my
feet
the
dew
must
be
is
no
dew
falling
you
come
us
go
it
is
later
than
i
generally
go
in
pigott
will
wonder
what
has
become
of
mind
pigott
the
night
is
too
fine
to
waste
asleep
besides
you
know
one
should
always
look
at
ruins
by
moonlight
please
she
looked
at
him
doubtfully
hesitated
and
came
do
you
want
to
see
she
said
presently
with
as
near
an
approach
to
irritation
as
he
had
ever
heard
her
indulge
in
is
the
famous
window
that
fraser
always
goes
into
raptures
is
beautiful
shall
we
sit
down
here
and
look
at
it
they
sat
down
on
a
low
mass
of
fallen
masonry
some
fifteen
paces
from
the
window
around
them
lay
a
delicate
tracery
of
shadows
whilst
they
themselves
were
seated
in
the
eye
of
the
moonlight
and
remained
for
a
while
as
silent
and
as
still
as
though
they
had
been
the
shades
of
the
painted
figures
that
had
once
filled
the
stony
frame
above
them
he
said
at
listen
and
i
will
tell
you
something
my
mother
a
woman
to
whom
sorrow
had
become
almost
an
inspiration
when
she
was
dying
spoke
to
me
something
thus
is
she
said
one
thing
that
i
know
of
that
has
the
power
to
make
life
happy
as
god
meant
it
to
be
and
as
the
folly
and
weakness
of
men
and
women
render
it
nearly
impossible
for
it
to
be
and
that
is
love
has
been
the
consolation
of
my
own
existence
in
the
midst
of
many
troubles
first
the
great
devotion
i
bore
your
father
and
then
that
which
i
entertain
for
yourself
without
these
two
ties
life
would
indeed
have
been
a
desert
and
yet
though
it
is
a
grief
to
me
to
leave
you
and
though
i
shrink
from
the
dark
passage
that
lies
before
me
so
far
does
that
first
great
love
outweigh
the
love
i
bear
you
that
in
my
calmer
moments
i
am
glad
to
go
because
i
know
i
am
awaited
by
your
father
and
from
this
i
wish
you
to
learn
a
lesson
look
for
your
happiness
in
life
from
the
love
of
your
life
for
there
only
will
you
find
it
do
not
fritter
away
your
heart
but
seek
out
some
woman
some
one
good
and
pure
and
true
and
in
giving
her
your
devotion
you
will
reap
a
full
reward
for
her
happiness
will
reflect
your
own
and
if
your
choice
is
right
you
will
however
stormy
your
life
may
be
lay
up
for
yourself
as
i
feel
that
i
have
done
an
everlasting
she
listened
to
him
in
silence
he
went
on
boldly
enough
now
that
the
ice
was
broken
have
often
thought
about
what
my
mother
said
but
until
now
i
have
never
understood
her
meaning
i
do
understand
it
now
angela
do
understand
me
there
was
no
answer
she
sat
there
upon
the
fallen
masonry
gazing
at
the
ruins
round
her
motionless
and
white
as
a
marble
goddess
forgotten
in
her
desecrated
fane
angela
listen
to
to
me
i
have
found
the
woman
of
whom
my
mother
spoke
who
must
be
so
and
pure
and
you
are
she
i
love
you
angela
i
love
you
with
my
whole
life
and
soul
i
love
you
for
this
world
and
the
next
oh
do
not
reject
me
though
i
am
so
little
worthy
of
you
i
will
try
to
grow
so
dearest
can
you
love
me
still
there
was
silence
but
he
thought
that
he
saw
her
breast
heave
gently
then
he
placed
his
hand
all
trembling
with
the
fierce
emotion
that
throbbed
along
his
veins
upon
the
palm
that
hung
listless
by
her
side
and
gazed
into
her
eyes
still
she
neither
spoke
nor
shrank
and
in
the
imperfect
light
her
face
looked
very
pale
while
her
lovely
eyes
were
dark
and
meaningless
as
those
of
one
entranced
then
slowly
he
gathered
up
his
courage
for
an
effort
and
raising
his
face
to
the
level
of
her
own
he
kissed
her
full
upon
her
lips
she
stirred
she
sighed
he
had
broken
the
spell
the
sweet
face
that
had
withdrawn
itself
drew
nearer
to
him
for
a
second
the
awakened
eyes
looked
into
his
own
and
filled
them
with
reflected
splendour
and
then
he
became
aware
of
a
warm
arm
thrown
about
his
neck
and
the
stars
grew
dim
and
sense
and
life
itself
seemed
to
shake
upon
their
thrones
for
a
joy
almost
too
great
for
mortal
man
to
bear
took
possession
of
his
heart
as
she
laid
her
willing
lips
upon
his
own
and
then
before
he
knew
her
purpose
she
slid
down
upon
her
knees
beside
him
and
placed
her
head
upon
his
breast
he
said
kneel
so
look
at
slowly
she
raised
her
face
wreathed
and
lovely
with
many
blushes
and
looked
upon
him
with
tearful
eyes
he
tried
to
raise
her
me
be
she
said
speaking
very
low
am
best
so
it
is
the
attitude
of
adoration
and
i
have
i
can
not
bear
to
see
you
kneel
to
arthur
you
do
not
understand
a
minute
since
did
not
understand
that
a
woman
is
very
humble
when
she
really
love
me
angela
you
known
that
long
only
it
you
kissed
me
before
then
there
was
something
in
my
heart
but
i
did
not
know
what
it
was
listen
dear
she
went
on
one
minute
to
me
first
and
i
will
get
for
he
was
again
attempting
to
raise
her
i
have
to
say
is
best
said
upon
my
knees
for
i
want
to
thank
god
who
sent
you
to
me
and
to
thank
you
too
for
your
goodness
it
is
so
wonderful
that
you
should
love
a
simple
girl
like
me
and
i
am
so
thankful
to
you
oh
i
have
never
lived
till
now
rising
to
her
full
stature
feel
as
though
i
had
been
crowned
a
queen
of
happy
things
dethrone
me
desert
me
and
i
will
still
be
grateful
to
you
for
this
hour
of
imperial
happiness
but
if
you
after
a
while
when
you
know
all
my
faults
and
imperfections
better
can
still
care
for
me
i
know
that
there
is
something
in
me
that
will
enable
me
to
repay
you
for
what
you
have
given
me
by
making
your
whole
life
happy
dear
i
do
not
know
if
i
speak
as
other
women
do
but
believe
me
it
is
out
of
the
fulness
of
my
heart
take
care
arthur
oh
take
care
lest
your
fate
should
be
that
of
the
magician
you
spoke
of
the
other
day
who
evoked
the
spirit
and
then
fell
down
before
it
in
terror
you
have
also
called
up
a
spirit
and
i
pray
that
it
was
not
done
in
sport
lest
it
should
trouble
you
do
not
speak
so
to
me
it
is
i
who
should
have
knelt
to
you
yes
you
were
right
when
you
called
yourself
queen
of
happy
you
are
a
overrate
me
your
disillusion
will
be
the
more
painful
come
arthur
let
us
go
he
rose
and
went
with
her
in
a
dream
of
joy
that
for
a
moment
precluded
speech
at
the
door
she
bade
him
and
oh
happiness
gave
him
her
lips
to
kiss
then
they
parted
their
hearts
too
full
for
words
one
thing
he
asked
her
however
was
it
that
took
you
to
your
grave
she
looked
at
him
with
a
curiously
mixed
expression
of
shy
love
and
conviction
on
her
face
and
answered
spirit
who
led
me
to
your
chapter
xxvii
recovery
when
the
doctors
had
given
up
all
hope
was
sufficiently
marvellous
to
suggest
the
idea
that
a
certain
power
had
the
principle
give
him
the
longest
of
ropes
but
it
could
in
reality
be
traced
to
a
more
terrestrial
lady
nursing
had
it
not
been
for
this
nursing
it
is
very
certain
that
her
patient
would
have
joined
his
forefathers
in
the
bratham
churchyard
for
whole
days
and
nights
she
watched
and
tended
him
scarcely
closing
her
own
eyes
and
quite
heedless
of
the
danger
of
infection
till
in
the
end
she
conquered
the
fever
and
snatched
him
from
the
jaws
of
the
grave
how
often
has
not
a
devotion
been
successful
in
such
a
struggle
on
the
monday
following
the
events
narrated
in
the
last
chapter
george
now
in
an
advanced
stage
of
convalescence
though
forbidden
to
go
abroad
for
another
fortnight
was
sitting
downstairs
enjoying
the
warm
sunshine
and
the
sensation
of
returning
life
and
vigour
that
was
creeping
into
his
veins
when
lady
bellamy
came
into
the
room
bringing
with
her
some
medicine
is
your
tonic
george
it
is
the
last
dose
that
i
can
give
you
as
i
am
going
back
to
my
disconsolate
husband
at
have
you
go
away
yet
i
am
not
well
must
go
george
people
will
begin
to
talk
if
i
stop
here
any
if
you
must
i
suppose
you
must
he
answered
sulkily
i
must
say
i
think
that
you
show
a
great
want
of
consideration
for
my
comfort
who
is
to
look
after
me
i
should
like
to
know
i
am
far
from
well
from
me
she
said
softly
am
very
sorry
to
leave
you
and
am
glad
to
have
been
of
help
to
you
though
you
have
never
thought
much
about
i
am
sure
i
am
much
obliged
but
it
is
not
likely
that
you
would
leave
me
to
rot
of
fever
without
coming
to
look
after
she
sighed
as
she
answered
would
not
do
as
much
for
bother
anne
get
sentimental
before
you
go
i
must
speak
to
you
about
that
girl
angela
have
you
taken
any
steps
lady
bellamy
started
are
you
still
bent
upon
that
project
course
i
am
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
my
illness
was
one
long
dream
of
her
i
am
more
bent
upon
it
than
do
you
still
insist
upon
my
playing
the
part
you
had
marked
out
for
me
do
you
know
george
that
there
were
times
in
your
illness
when
if
i
had
relaxed
my
care
for
a
single
five
minutes
it
would
have
turned
the
scale
against
you
and
that
once
i
did
not
close
my
eyes
for
five
nights
look
at
me
how
thin
and
worn
i
am
it
is
from
nursing
you
i
have
saved
your
life
surely
you
will
not
now
force
me
to
do
this
unnatural
my
dear
anne
you
had
saved
my
life
fifty
times
i
would
still
force
you
to
do
it
ah
it
is
no
use
your
looking
at
that
safe
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
got
my
keys
and
searched
it
whilst
i
was
ill
but
i
was
too
sharp
for
you
i
had
the
letters
moved
when
i
heard
that
you
were
coming
to
nurse
me
they
are
back
there
now
though
how
disappointed
you
must
have
been
and
he
chuckled
should
have
done
better
to
let
you
die
monster
of
wickedness
and
ingratitude
that
you
are
she
said
stamping
her
foot
upon
the
floor
and
the
tears
of
vexation
standing
in
her
eyes
letters
my
dear
anne
remember
that
you
have
got
to
earn
your
letters
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
nursing
but
business
is
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
spoke
in
her
ordinary
tone
the
way
talking
of
letters
there
was
one
came
for
you
this
morning
in
your
cousin
handwriting
and
with
a
london
postmark
will
you
read
it
anything
from
the
father
of
my
inamorata
will
be
she
fetched
the
letter
and
gave
it
him
he
read
it
aloud
after
a
page
of
congratulations
on
his
convalescence
it
ended
now
i
want
to
make
a
proposal
to
to
buy
back
the
isleworth
lands
from
you
i
know
that
the
place
is
distasteful
to
you
and
will
probably
be
doubly
so
after
your
severe
illness
but
if
you
care
to
keep
the
house
and
grounds
i
am
not
particularly
anxious
to
acquire
them
i
am
prepared
to
offer
a
good
price
see
him
hanged
first
was
comment
did
he
get
the
money
it
and
made
it
i
at
any
rate
he
shall
not
buy
me
out
with
it
no
no
master
philip
i
am
not
fond
enough
of
you
to
do
you
that
does
not
strike
you
she
said
coldly
you
hold
in
your
hands
a
lever
that
may
roll
all
your
difficulties
about
this
girl
out
of
the
jove
you
are
right
anne
trust
a
brain
but
i
want
to
sell
the
estates
unless
i
am
forced
you
rather
part
with
the
land
or
give
up
your
project
of
marrying
angela
caresfoot
do
you
ask
you
will
have
to
choose
between
the
i
had
rather
had
better
give
it
up
george
i
am
not
superstitious
but
i
have
knowledge
in
things
that
you
do
not
understand
and
i
foresee
nothing
but
disaster
in
this
and
for
all
anne
i
will
not
give
it
up
whilst
i
have
any
breath
left
in
my
body
and
i
take
my
oath
that
unless
you
help
me
and
help
me
honestly
i
will
expose
i
am
your
very
humble
servant
you
may
count
on
me
the
slave
pulls
well
when
the
lash
hangs
over
his
shoulders
and
she
laughed
coldly
just
then
a
servant
announced
that
caresfoot
was
at
the
door
and
anxious
to
speak
to
his
cousin
he
was
ordered
to
show
him
into
the
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
on
his
errand
george
said
will
not
see
him
say
i
am
too
unwell
but
do
you
go
and
see
that
you
make
the
most
of
your
lady
bellamy
nodded
and
left
the
room
she
found
philip
in
the
how
do
you
do
caresfoot
i
come
from
your
cousin
to
say
that
he
can
not
see
you
he
has
scarcely
recovered
sufficiently
from
the
illness
through
which
i
have
been
nursing
him
but
of
course
you
know
all
about
yes
lady
bellamy
i
have
heard
all
about
it
including
your
own
brave
behaviour
to
which
the
doctor
tells
me
george
owes
his
life
i
am
sorry
that
he
can
not
see
me
though
i
have
just
come
down
from
town
and
called
in
on
my
way
from
roxham
i
had
some
rather
important
business
that
i
wanted
to
speak
your
offer
to
repurchase
the
isleworth
lands
she
asked
you
know
of
the
affair
yes
that
was
i
am
commissioned
to
give
you
a
philip
listened
anxiously
cousin
absolutely
refuses
to
sell
any
part
of
the
nothing
change
his
determination
i
am
ready
to
give
a
good
price
and
pay
a
separate
valuation
for
the
he
does
not
intend
to
a
deep
depression
spread
itself
over
her
face
there
go
the
hopes
of
twenty
years
he
said
twenty
long
years
ever
since
my
misfortune
i
have
toiled
and
schemed
to
get
these
lands
back
and
now
it
is
all
for
nothing
well
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
and
he
turned
to
go
a
minute
caresfoot
do
you
know
you
interest
me
very
am
proud
to
interest
so
charming
a
lady
he
answered
a
touch
of
depressed
gallantry
is
as
it
should
be
but
you
interest
me
because
you
are
an
instance
of
the
truth
of
the
saying
that
every
man
has
some
ruling
passion
if
only
one
could
discover
it
why
do
you
want
these
particular
lands
your
money
will
buy
others
just
as
does
a
swiss
get
why
does
a
man
defrauded
of
his
own
wish
to
recover
it
lady
bellamy
mused
a
little
would
you
say
if
i
showed
you
an
easy
way
to
get
them
philip
turned
sharply
round
with
a
new
look
of
hope
upon
his
face
would
earn
my
eternal
gratitude
that
i
should
be
glad
to
put
into
a
practical
she
laughed
you
must
speak
to
sir
john
about
that
now
listen
i
am
going
to
surprise
you
your
cousin
wants
to
get
married
george
wants
to
get
married
so
and
now
i
have
a
further
surprise
in
store
for
wants
to
marry
your
daughter
this
time
philip
said
nothing
but
he
started
in
evident
and
uncomfortable
astonishment
if
lady
bellamy
wished
to
surprise
him
she
had
certainly
succeeded
you
are
joking
he
said
never
was
further
from
joking
in
my
life
he
is
desperately
in
love
with
her
and
wild
to
marry
you
now
see
a
way
to
force
your
cousin
to
sell
the
lands
the
price
of
hand
philip
walked
up
and
down
the
room
in
thought
though
as
the
reader
may
remember
he
had
himself
but
a
month
before
been
base
enough
to
suggest
that
his
daughter
should
use
her
eyes
to
forward
his
projects
he
had
never
in
justice
to
him
be
it
said
dreamt
of
forcing
her
into
a
marriage
in
every
way
little
less
than
unnatural
his
idea
of
responsibility
towards
his
daughter
was
as
regards
sins
of
omission
extremely
lax
but
there
were
some
of
commission
that
he
did
not
care
to
face
certain
fears
and
memories
oppressed
him
too
much
to
allow
of
it
bellamy
he
said
presently
have
known
my
cousin
george
intimately
for
many
years
and
are
probably
sufficiently
acquainted
with
his
habits
of
life
to
know
that
such
a
marriage
would
be
an
a
man
who
has
been
wild
in
his
youth
makes
a
good
husband
she
answered
quietly
more
i
think
of
it
went
on
philip
excitedly
after
the
fashion
of
one
who
would
lash
himself
into
a
passion
more
i
see
the
utter
impossibility
of
any
such
thing
and
i
must
say
that
i
wonder
at
your
having
undertaken
such
an
errand
on
the
one
hand
there
is
a
young
girl
who
though
i
do
not
from
force
of
circumstances
see
much
of
myself
is
i
believe
as
good
as
she
is
on
the
other
broke
in
lady
bellamy
ironically
the
isleworth
on
the
other
went
on
philip
without
paying
heed
to
her
remark
am
going
to
speak
plainly
lady
a
man
utterly
devoid
of
the
foundations
of
moral
character
whose
appearance
is
certainly
against
him
who
i
have
got
reason
to
know
is
not
to
be
trusted
and
who
is
old
enough
to
be
her
father
and
her
cousin
to
you
ask
me
to
forward
such
a
marriage
as
this
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
my
responsibilities
as
a
father
forbid
it
it
would
be
the
wickedest
thing
i
have
ever
done
to
put
the
girl
into
the
power
of
such
a
lady
bellamy
burst
into
a
low
peal
of
laughter
she
never
laughed
aloud
she
thought
that
it
was
now
time
to
throw
him
a
little
off
his
balance
me
she
said
with
her
sweetest
smile
you
must
admit
that
there
is
something
rather
ludicrous
in
hearing
the
hero
of
the
great
maria
lee
scandal
talking
about
moral
character
and
the
father
who
detests
his
daughter
so
much
that
he
fears
to
look
her
in
the
face
and
whose
sole
object
is
to
rid
himself
of
an
encumbrance
prating
of
his
paternal
philip
started
visibly
at
her
words
caresfoot
she
went
on
surprise
you
by
my
knowledge
but
we
women
are
sad
spies
and
it
is
my
little
amusement
to
find
out
other
secrets
a
very
useful
little
amusement
i
could
tell
you
many
was
about
to
say
broke
in
philip
who
had
naturally
no
desire
to
see
more
of
the
secrets
of
his
life
unveiled
by
lady
bellamy
even
if
i
did
wish
to
get
rid
of
angela
i
should
have
little
difficulty
in
doing
so
as
young
heigham
who
has
been
stopping
at
the
abbey
house
for
a
fortnight
or
so
is
head
over
ears
in
love
with
her
indeed
i
should
think
it
highly
probable
that
they
are
at
this
moment
it
was
lady
turn
to
start
now
she
said
did
not
know
that
that
complicates
and
then
with
a
sudden
change
of
caresfoot
as
a
friend
let
me
beg
of
you
not
to
throw
away
such
a
chance
in
a
hurry
for
the
sake
of
a
few
nonsensical
ideas
abut
a
girl
what
is
she
after
all
that
she
should
stand
in
the
way
of
such
grave
interests
as
you
have
in
hand
i
tell
you
that
he
is
perfectly
mad
about
her
you
can
make
your
own
terms
and
fix
your
own
ay
that
is
what
it
would
price
for
her
body
and
and
what
of
it
the
thing
is
done
every
day
only
one
does
not
talk
of
it
in
that
taught
you
who
were
once
a
young
girl
yourself
to
plead
such
a
cause
as
this
it
is
a
very
good
cause
that
will
benefit
everybody
especially
your
daughter
george
will
get
what
he
wants
you
with
the
recovery
of
the
estates
will
also
recover
your
lost
position
and
reputation
both
to
a
great
extent
an
affair
of
landed
property
heigham
will
gain
a
little
experience
whilst
she
will
bloom
into
a
great
lady
and
like
any
other
girl
in
the
same
circumstances
learn
to
adore
her
husband
in
a
few
what
will
get
lady
bellamy
she
replied
with
a
gay
laugh
you
know
virtue
is
its
own
reward
i
shall
be
quite
satisfied
in
seeing
everybody
else
made
happy
come
i
do
not
want
to
press
you
about
the
matter
at
present
think
it
over
at
your
leisure
i
only
beg
you
not
to
give
a
decided
answer
to
young
heigham
should
he
ask
you
for
angela
till
i
have
seen
you
in
a
time
then
if
you
like
it
you
can
leave
it
alone
and
nobody
will
be
a
penny
the
you
like
but
i
tell
you
that
i
can
never
consent
and
philip
took
his
leave
cousin
entirely
refuses
his
consent
and
angela
is
by
this
time
probably
engaged
to
your
arthur
heigham
was
lady
not
very
promising
report
to
the
interesting
invalid
in
the
room
after
relieving
his
feelings
at
this
intelligence
in
language
more
forcible
than
polite
george
remarked
that
under
these
circumstances
matters
looked
very
bad
at
all
they
look
very
well
i
shall
see
your
cousin
again
in
a
time
when
i
shall
have
a
different
tale
to
wait
a
week
with
that
young
blackguard
making
the
running
on
the
spot
i
have
put
poison
into
mind
and
the
surest
poison
always
works
slow
besides
the
mischief
has
been
done
i
will
come
and
see
you
in
a
day
or
two
when
i
have
made
my
plans
you
see
i
mean
to
earn
my
chapter
xxviii
with
what
degree
of
soundness
our
pair
of
lovers
slumbered
on
that
memorable
saturday
night
let
those
who
have
been
so
fortunate
or
unfortunate
as
to
have
been
placed
in
analogous
circumstances
form
their
own
opinion
it
is
however
certain
that
arthur
gazed
upon
the
moon
and
sundry
of
the
larger
planets
for
some
hours
until
they
unkindly
set
and
left
him
for
his
candle
had
burnt
out
to
find
his
way
to
bed
in
the
dark
with
his
reflections
we
will
not
trouble
ourselves
or
rather
we
will
not
intrude
upon
their
privacy
but
there
was
another
person
in
the
house
who
sat
at
an
open
window
and
looked
upon
the
angela
to
wit
let
us
avail
ourselves
of
our
rightful
privilege
and
look
into
her
thoughts
love
had
come
upon
her
as
a
surprise
but
it
had
found
a
perfect
home
all
the
days
and
hours
that
she
had
spent
in
his
company
had
unknown
to
herself
been
mysteriously
employed
in
preparing
a
habitation
to
receive
it
we
all
know
the
beautiful
bible
story
of
the
creation
how
first
there
was
an
empty
void
and
the
spirit
brooding
on
the
waters
then
light
and
then
life
and
last
man
coming
to
turn
all
things
to
his
uses
surely
that
story
which
is
the
type
and
symbol
of
many
things
is
of
none
more
so
than
of
the
growth
and
birth
of
a
perfected
love
in
the
human
heart
the
soil
is
made
ready
in
the
dead
winter
and
receives
the
seed
into
its
bosom
then
comes
the
spring
and
it
is
clothed
with
verdure
space
is
void
till
the
sun
shoots
its
sudden
rays
athwart
it
and
makes
it
splendid
the
heart
is
cold
and
unwitting
of
its
ends
till
the
spirit
broods
upon
it
as
upon
the
waters
and
it
grows
quick
with
the
purposes
of
life
and
then
what
a
change
is
there
what
has
the
flower
in
common
with
the
seed
from
whence
it
sprang
or
the
noonday
sky
with
the
darkness
before
the
dawn
thinking
in
her
chamber
with
the
night
air
playing
on
her
hot
brow
and
her
hand
pressed
upon
her
heart
as
though
to
still
the
tumult
of
its
joy
angela
grew
vaguely
conscious
of
these
things
she
the
same
in
heart
and
mind
that
she
had
been
a
month
ago
no
a
thousand
times
no
then
what
was
this
mysterious
change
that
seemed
to
shake
her
inmost
life
to
its
foundations
what
angel
had
troubled
the
waters
into
which
she
had
so
newly
plunged
and
whence
came
the
healing
virtue
that
she
found
in
them
bringing
rest
after
the
vague
trouble
of
the
last
two
weeks
with
sight
to
see
the
only
love
with
speed
to
follow
and
strength
to
hold
oh
happy
happy
world
oh
merciful
creator
who
gave
her
to
drink
of
such
a
living
spring
oh
arthur
beloved
arthur
on
sunday
mornings
it
was
habit
to
relax
the
draconian
severity
of
her
laws
in
the
matter
of
breakfast
which
generally
speaking
was
not
till
about
eight
at
that
hour
precisely
on
the
sabbath
in
question
she
appeared
as
not
as
usual
for
it
being
sunday
she
had
on
her
stiff
black
with
all
due
solemnity
made
the
tea
a
few
minutes
elapsed
and
angela
entered
dressed
in
white
and
very
lovely
in
her
simple
robe
but
a
trifle
pale
and
with
a
shy
look
upon
her
face
she
greeted
her
nurse
with
a
kiss
what
is
the
matter
with
you
dearie
ejaculated
pigott
whose
watchful
eye
detected
a
change
she
could
not
define
look
different
i
will
tell
you
at
that
moment
quick
step
was
heard
advancing
down
the
passage
together
with
a
pattering
noise
that
announced
the
presence
of
aleck
and
as
they
came
angela
poor
angela
grew
red
and
redder
and
yet
more
painfully
red
till
pigott
watching
her
face
was
enabled
to
form
a
shrewd
guess
as
to
what
was
the
cause
of
her
unaccustomed
looks
on
came
the
steps
and
open
flew
the
door
more
and
more
ready
to
sink
into
the
earth
looked
angela
and
so
interested
grew
nurse
pigott
that
she
actually
poured
some
hot
tea
on
to
her
dress
a
thing
she
could
never
remember
having
done
before
the
first
to
enter
was
aleck
who
following
his
custom
sprang
upon
angela
and
licked
her
hand
and
behind
aleck
looking
somewhat
confused
but
handsome
and
his
was
one
of
those
faces
that
become
handsome
when
their
owners
are
master
and
then
there
ensued
an
infinitesimal
but
most
awkward
pause
on
such
occasions
as
the
present
namely
the
first
meeting
after
an
engagement
there
is
when
it
occurs
in
the
presence
of
a
third
very
considerable
difficulty
in
the
minds
of
the
parties
to
know
what
demeanour
they
are
to
adopt
towards
one
another
are
they
to
treat
the
little
affair
of
the
previous
evening
as
a
kind
of
confidential
communication
not
to
be
alluded
to
except
in
private
conversation
and
to
drop
into
the
and
miss
of
yesterday
that
would
certainly
be
the
easiest
but
then
it
would
also
be
a
decided
act
of
mutual
retreat
or
are
they
to
rush
into
each
arms
as
becomes
betrothed
lovers
this
process
is
so
new
that
they
feel
that
it
still
requires
private
rehearsal
and
meanwhile
time
presses
and
everybody
is
beginning
to
stare
and
something
be
done
these
were
very
much
the
feelings
of
arthur
and
angela
he
hesitated
before
her
confused
and
she
kept
her
head
down
over
the
dog
but
presently
aleck
getting
bored
moved
on
and
as
it
would
have
been
inane
to
continue
to
stare
at
the
floor
she
had
to
raise
herself
as
slowly
as
she
might
soon
their
eyes
arrived
in
the
same
plane
and
whether
a
mutual
glance
of
intelligence
was
exchanged
or
whether
their
power
of
attraction
overcame
his
power
of
resistance
it
is
not
easy
to
determine
but
certain
it
is
that
following
a
primary
natural
law
arthur
gravitated
towards
her
and
kissed
her
on
the
face
exclaimed
pigott
and
the
rolled
unheeded
on
the
floor
i
suppose
i
had
better
explain
began
he
think
you
have
spilt
the
milk
added
she
we
have
become
engaged
and
to
pieces
i
declare
broke
in
angela
with
her
head
somewhere
near
the
carpet
and
then
they
both
laughed
i
never
no
not
in
all
my
born
days
sir
and
miss
angela
all
i
have
got
to
say
about
this
extraordinary
glanced
at
each
other
in
that
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
on
it
and
i
hope
and
pray
how
as
you
may
be
happy
and
if
you
treat
my
angela
right
be
just
the
happiest
and
luckiest
man
in
the
three
kingdoms
including
ireland
the
royal
family
and
if
you
treat
her
wrong
worse
will
come
to
you
and
her
poor
last
words
as
i
heard
with
my
own
ears
will
come
true
to
you
and
serve
you
and
all
the
milk
upon
the
floor
and
god
bless
you
both
my
dears
is
the
prayer
of
an
old
and
here
the
worthy
soul
broke
down
and
began
to
cry
nor
were
eyes
free
from
tears
after
this
little
episode
breakfast
proceeded
in
something
like
the
usual
way
church
was
at
and
a
while
before
the
hour
arthur
and
angela
strolled
down
to
the
spot
that
had
already
become
as
holy
ground
to
them
and
looked
into
each
eyes
and
said
again
the
same
sweet
words
then
they
went
on
and
mingling
with
the
little
did
not
number
more
than
thirty
passed
into
the
cool
quiet
of
the
church
said
a
woman
as
they
went
by
she
just
a
beauty
what
a
pretty
wedding
make
arthur
overheard
it
and
noted
the
woman
and
afterwards
found
a
pretext
to
give
her
five
shillings
because
he
said
it
was
a
lucky
omen
on
the
of
the
pretty
little
church
there
was
spread
the
white
of
the
rubric
it
was
the
day
for
the
monthly
celebration
of
the
sacrament
that
met
the
religious
requirements
of
the
village
you
stay
to
the
sacrament
with
me
whispered
angela
to
her
lover
in
the
interval
between
their
seating
themselves
and
the
entry
of
the
clergyman
arthur
nodded
assent
and
so
when
the
time
came
those
two
went
up
together
to
the
rails
and
kneeling
side
by
side
ate
of
the
bread
and
drank
of
the
cup
and
rising
departed
thence
with
a
new
link
between
them
for
be
sure
part
of
the
prayers
which
they
offered
up
at
that
high
moment
were
in
humble
petition
to
the
almighty
to
set
his
solemn
seal
and
blessing
on
their
love
indeed
so
far
as
angela
was
concerned
there
were
few
acts
of
her
simple
life
that
she
did
not
consecrate
by
prayer
how
much
more
then
was
she
bent
on
bringing
this
the
greatest
of
all
her
acts
before
her
throne
strange
indeed
and
full
of
a
holy
promise
is
the
yearning
with
which
we
turn
to
heaven
to
seek
sanctification
of
our
deeds
feeling
our
weakness
and
craving
strength
from
the
source
of
strength
a
yearning
of
which
the
church
with
that
subtle
knowledge
of
human
nature
which
is
one
of
the
mainsprings
of
its
power
has
not
been
slow
to
avail
itself
and
this
need
is
more
especially
felt
in
matters
connected
with
the
noblest
of
all
passions
perhaps
because
all
true
love
and
all
true
religion
come
from
a
common
home
thus
pledged
to
one
another
with
a
new
and
awful
pledge
and
knit
together
in
the
bonds
of
an
universal
love
embracing
their
poor
affection
as
the
wide
skies
embrace
the
earth
they
rose
and
went
their
ways
purer
to
worship
and
stronger
to
endure
that
afternoon
arthur
had
a
conversation
with
his
betrothed
that
partaking
of
a
business
nature
in
the
beginning
ended
rather
oddly
must
speak
to
your
father
when
he
comes
back
dear
he
began
father
oh
yes
i
had
forgotten
about
that
and
she
looked
a
little
anxious
i
am
fairly
well
off
so
i
see
no
cause
why
he
should
i
think
that
he
will
be
rather
glad
to
get
rid
of
pigott
and
myself
you
know
that
he
is
not
very
fond
of
is
strange
want
of
taste
on
his
i
know
everybody
does
not
see
me
with
your
eyes
they
have
not
the
chance
all
the
world
would
love
you
if
it
knew
you
but
seriously
i
think
that
he
can
hardly
object
or
he
would
not
have
allowed
us
to
be
thrown
so
much
together
for
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
that
sort
of
thing
has
only
one
do
you
mean
mean
that
to
import
a
young
fellow
into
the
house
and
throw
him
solely
into
a
company
is
very
apt
to
bring
what
has
been
brought
you
mean
that
you
think
that
i
should
have
fallen
in
love
with
any
gentleman
who
had
come
here
arthur
not
seeing
the
slight
flash
of
indignation
in
her
eyes
replied
you
know
there
is
always
a
risk
but
i
should
imagine
that
it
would
very
much
depend
upon
the
a
little
am
ashamed
of
you
how
can
you
think
such
things
of
me
you
must
have
a
very
poor
opinion
of
dear
why
should
i
suppose
myself
superior
to
anybody
else
that
you
should
only
fall
in
love
with
me
you
set
too
high
a
value
on
you
set
too
low
a
value
on
me
you
do
not
understand
me
you
are
my
fate
my
other
self
how
would
it
have
been
possible
for
me
to
love
any
one
but
you
i
feel
as
though
i
had
been
travelling
to
meet
you
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
to
stand
by
your
side
till
it
crumbles
away
yes
for
eternity
itself
oh
arthur
do
not
laugh
at
what
i
say
i
am
indeed
only
a
simple
girl
but
as
i
told
you
last
night
there
is
something
stirring
in
me
now
my
real
life
my
eternal
part
something
that
you
have
awakened
and
with
which
you
have
to
deal
something
apart
from
the
you
see
before
you
as
i
speak
i
feel
and
know
that
when
we
are
dead
and
gone
i
shall
love
you
still
when
more
ages
have
passed
than
there
are
leaves
upon
that
tree
i
shall
love
you
still
arthur
i
am
yours
for
ever
for
the
time
that
is
and
is
to
she
spoke
with
the
grand
freedom
of
one
inspired
nay
he
felt
that
she
was
inspired
and
the
same
feeling
of
awe
that
had
come
upon
him
when
he
first
saw
her
face
again
took
possession
of
him
taking
her
hand
he
kissed
it
he
said
angela
who
am
i
that
you
should
love
me
so
what
have
i
done
that
such
a
treasure
should
be
given
to
me
i
hope
that
it
may
be
as
you
say
will
be
as
i
say
she
answered
as
she
bent
to
kiss
him
and
they
went
on
in
silence
chapter
xxix
philip
arrived
home
about
one
on
the
monday
and
after
their
nursery
dinner
arthur
made
his
way
to
the
study
and
soon
found
himself
in
the
dread
what
presence
is
more
dread
most
people
would
rather
face
a
with
the
gout
the
man
whose
daughter
he
was
about
to
ask
in
marriage
philip
whom
he
found
seated
by
a
tray
the
contents
of
which
he
seemed
in
no
humour
to
touch
received
him
with
his
customary
politeness
saying
with
a
smile
that
he
hoped
he
had
not
come
to
tell
him
that
he
was
sick
of
the
place
and
its
inhabitants
and
was
going
away
from
it
caresfoot
i
come
to
speak
to
you
on
a
very
different
philip
glanced
up
with
a
quick
look
of
expectant
curiosity
but
said
nothing
short
said
arthur
desperately
come
to
ask
you
to
sanction
my
engagement
to
a
very
awkward
are
then
engaged
to
my
daughter
to
your
consent
i
then
came
another
pause
will
understand
me
heigham
when
i
say
that
you
take
me
rather
by
surprise
in
this
business
your
acquaintance
with
her
has
been
is
true
but
i
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
but
she
knows
absolutely
nothing
of
the
world
and
her
preference
for
as
you
say
you
are
engaged
to
her
i
presume
she
has
shown
a
be
a
mistake
merely
a
young
romantic
arthur
thought
of
his
conversation
of
the
previous
day
with
angela
and
could
not
help
smiling
as
he
answered
think
if
you
ask
her
that
she
will
tell
you
that
is
not
the
i
will
be
frank
with
you
i
like
you
and
you
have
i
believe
sufficient
means
of
course
you
know
that
my
daughter
will
have
any
rate
till
i
am
dead
he
added
quickly
never
thought
about
the
matter
but
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
to
marry
her
with
nothing
but
good
i
was
going
to
say
that
notwithstanding
this
marriage
is
an
important
matter
and
i
must
have
time
to
think
over
it
before
i
give
you
a
decided
answer
say
a
week
i
shall
not
however
expect
you
to
leave
here
unless
you
wish
to
do
so
nor
shall
i
seek
to
place
any
restrictions
on
your
intercourse
with
angela
since
it
would
appear
that
the
mischief
is
already
done
i
am
flattered
by
your
proposal
but
i
must
have
time
and
you
must
understand
that
in
this
instance
hesitation
does
not
necessarily
mean
in
affairs
of
this
nature
a
man
is
satisfied
with
small
mercies
and
willing
to
put
up
with
inconveniences
that
appear
trifling
in
comparison
with
the
disasters
that
might
have
overtaken
him
arthur
was
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
indeed
he
was
profuse
in
his
thanks
and
buoyed
up
with
all
the
confidence
of
youth
felt
sure
in
his
heart
that
he
would
soon
find
a
way
to
extinguish
any
objections
that
might
still
linger
in
mind
his
contented
himself
with
acknowledging
his
remarks
with
courtesy
and
the
interview
came
to
an
end
arthur
gone
however
his
host
lost
all
his
calmness
of
demeanour
and
rising
from
his
untasted
meal
paced
up
and
down
the
room
in
thought
everything
had
he
reflected
fallen
out
as
he
wished
young
heigham
wished
to
marry
his
daughter
and
he
could
not
wish
for
a
better
husband
save
for
the
fatality
which
had
sent
that
woman
to
him
on
her
errand
he
would
have
given
his
consent
at
once
and
been
glad
to
give
it
not
that
he
meant
to
refuse
had
no
such
idea
and
then
he
began
to
think
what
supposing
that
lady
embassy
had
been
of
a
nature
that
he
could
entertain
which
it
was
not
it
would
mean
to
him
it
would
mean
the
realization
of
the
work
and
aspirations
of
twenty
years
it
would
mean
his
into
the
property
and
position
from
which
he
had
according
to
his
own
view
been
unjustly
ousted
it
would
mean
last
but
not
least
triumph
over
george
and
now
chance
mighty
chance
as
fools
call
providence
had
at
last
thrown
into
his
hands
a
lever
with
which
it
would
be
easy
to
topple
over
every
that
lay
in
his
path
to
triumph
more
he
might
even
be
able
to
spoil
that
egyptian
george
giving
him
less
than
his
due
oh
how
he
hungered
for
the
broad
acres
of
his
birthright
longing
for
them
as
a
lover
longs
for
his
lost
bride
the
opportunity
would
never
come
again
why
should
he
throw
it
away
to
do
so
would
be
to
turn
his
cousin
into
an
open
and
implacable
foe
why
should
he
allow
this
girl
whose
birth
had
bereft
him
of
the
only
creature
he
had
ever
loved
whose
sex
had
alienated
the
family
estates
and
for
whose
company
he
cared
nothing
to
come
as
a
destruction
on
his
plans
she
would
be
the
man
loved
her
as
for
her
being
engaged
to
this
young
heigham
women
soon
got
over
those
things
after
all
now
that
he
came
to
think
of
the
matter
calmly
what
valid
cause
was
there
why
the
thing
should
not
be
and
as
he
paced
to
and
fro
and
thought
thus
an
answer
came
into
his
mind
for
there
rose
up
before
him
a
vision
of
his
dying
wife
and
there
sounded
in
his
ears
the
murmur
of
her
voice
that
for
all
its
broken
softness
had
with
its
last
accents
called
down
winged
vengeance
and
his
everlasting
doom
on
him
who
would
harm
her
unprotected
child
and
feeling
that
if
he
did
this
thing
on
him
would
be
the
vengeance
and
the
doom
he
thought
of
the
shadows
of
the
night
and
grew
afraid
when
arthur
and
his
host
met
according
to
their
custom
that
evening
no
allusion
was
made
on
either
side
to
their
conversation
of
the
afternoon
nor
did
her
father
even
speak
a
word
to
angela
on
the
subject
life
to
all
appearance
went
on
in
the
old
house
precisely
as
though
nothing
had
happened
philip
did
not
attempt
to
put
the
smallest
restraint
on
arthur
and
his
daughter
and
studiously
shut
his
eyes
to
the
pretty
obvious
signs
of
their
mutual
affection
for
them
the
long
june
days
were
golden
but
all
too
short
every
morning
found
their
mutual
love
more
perfect
but
when
the
flakes
of
crimson
light
faded
from
the
skies
and
night
dropped
her
veil
over
the
tall
trees
and
peaceful
lake
by
some
miracle
it
had
grown
deeper
and
more
perfect
still
day
by
day
arthur
discovered
new
charms
in
angela
here
some
hidden
knowledge
there
an
unsuspected
grace
and
everywhere
an
charity
and
love
day
by
day
he
gazed
deeper
into
the
depths
of
her
mind
and
still
there
were
more
to
plumb
for
it
was
a
storehouse
of
noble
thoughts
and
high
many
of
which
could
only
find
fulfilment
in
another
world
than
this
and
the
more
he
saw
of
her
the
prouder
he
was
to
think
that
such
a
perfect
creature
should
so
dearly
love
himself
and
with
the
greater
joy
did
he
look
forward
to
that
supreme
and
happy
hour
when
he
should
call
her
his
and
so
day
added
itself
to
day
and
found
them
happy
indeed
the
aspect
of
their
fortunes
seemed
as
smooth
and
smiling
as
the
summer
surface
of
the
lake
about
final
consent
to
their
engagement
they
did
not
trouble
themselves
judging
not
unnaturally
that
his
conduct
was
in
itself
a
guarantee
of
approval
if
he
meant
to
raise
any
serious
objections
he
would
surely
have
done
so
before
arthur
would
urge
and
angela
would
quite
agree
with
him
and
wonder
what
parent
could
find
it
in
his
heart
to
object
to
her
lover
what
a
merciful
provision
of
providence
it
is
that
throws
a
veil
over
the
future
only
to
be
pierced
by
the
of
scotchmen
where
should
we
find
a
flavour
in
those
unfrequent
cups
that
the
shyest
of
the
gods
joy
holds
to
our
yearning
lips
could
we
know
of
the
bitter
that
lurks
in
the
tinselled
bowl
surely
we
have
much
to
be
thankful
for
but
for
nothing
should
we
be
so
grateful
as
for
this
blessed
impotence
of
foresight
but
as
it
is
often
on
the
bluest
days
that
the
mercury
begins
to
sink
beneath
the
breath
of
hurricane
so
there
is
a
warning
spirit
implanted
in
sensitive
minds
that
makes
them
mistrustful
of
too
great
happiness
we
feel
that
for
most
of
us
the
wheel
of
our
fortunes
revolves
too
quickly
to
allow
of
a
long
continuance
of
unbroken
joy
said
angela
one
morning
when
eight
days
had
passed
since
her
return
from
town
are
too
happy
we
should
throw
something
into
the
have
not
got
a
ring
except
the
one
you
gave
me
he
answered
for
his
signet
was
on
her
finger
unless
we
sacrifice
aleck
or
the
ravens
i
know
what
it
is
to
joke
arthur
i
tell
you
we
are
too
could
arthur
have
seen
through
an
acre
or
so
of
undergrowth
as
angela
uttered
these
words
he
would
have
perceived
a
very
smart
with
the
bellamy
crest
on
his
buttons
delivering
a
letter
to
philip
it
is
true
that
there
was
nothing
particularly
alarming
about
that
but
its
contents
might
have
given
a
point
to
forebodings
it
ran
thus
house
monday
dear
caresfoot
reference
to
our
conversation
last
week
about
your
daughter
and
can
you
come
over
and
have
a
quiet
chat
with
me
this
afternoon
yours
philip
read
this
note
and
then
it
knowing
in
his
heart
that
now
was
his
opportunity
to
act
up
to
his
convictions
and
put
an
end
to
the
whole
transaction
in
a
few
decisive
words
but
a
man
who
has
for
so
many
years
given
place
to
the
devil
of
avarice
even
though
it
be
avarice
with
a
legitimate
object
can
not
shake
himself
free
from
his
clothes
in
a
moment
even
when
as
in
case
honour
and
right
to
say
nothing
of
a
still
more
powerful
factor
superstition
speak
so
loudly
in
his
ears
surely
he
thought
there
would
be
no
harm
in
hearing
what
she
had
to
say
he
could
explain
his
reasons
for
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
so
much
better
in
person
such
mental
struggles
have
only
one
end
presently
the
smart
bore
back
this
note
lady
bellamy
will
be
with
you
at
three
it
was
with
very
curious
sensations
that
philip
was
that
afternoon
shown
into
a
richly
furnished
boudoir
in
rewtham
house
he
had
not
been
in
that
room
since
he
had
talked
to
maria
lee
sitting
on
that
very
sofa
now
occupied
by
lady
still
beautiful
form
and
he
could
not
but
feel
that
it
was
a
place
of
evil
omen
for
him
lady
bellamy
rose
to
greet
him
with
her
most
fascinating
smile
is
very
kind
she
said
as
she
motioned
him
to
a
seat
which
philip
afterwards
discovered
had
been
carefully
arranged
so
as
to
put
his
features
in
the
full
light
whilst
sitting
on
the
sofa
her
own
were
concealed
caresfoot
she
began
after
a
little
pause
suppose
i
had
better
come
to
the
point
at
once
first
of
all
i
presume
that
as
you
anticipated
would
be
the
case
there
exists
some
sort
of
understanding
between
heigham
and
your
philip
nodded
your
cousin
is
as
determined
as
ever
about
the
matter
indeed
he
is
simply
infatuated
or
bewitched
i
really
know
am
sorry
for
it
lady
bellamy
as
i
can
not
moment
caresfoot
first
let
me
tell
you
his
offer
then
we
can
talk
it
over
he
offers
conditionally
on
his
marriage
with
your
daughter
to
sell
you
the
isleworth
estates
at
a
fair
valuation
hereafter
to
be
agreed
upon
and
to
make
a
large
what
part
does
he
wish
me
to
play
in
the
matter
first
you
must
get
rid
of
young
heigham
and
prevent
him
from
holding
communication
either
with
angela
herself
or
with
any
other
person
connected
with
this
place
for
one
year
from
the
date
of
his
departure
secondly
you
must
throw
no
obstacle
in
path
thirdly
if
required
you
must
dismiss
her
old
nurse
can
not
be
lady
bellamy
i
came
here
to
tell
you
so
i
dare
not
force
my
daughter
into
such
a
marriage
for
all
the
estates
in
lady
bellamy
laughed
is
amusing
she
said
see
a
father
afraid
of
his
own
daughter
but
you
are
caresfoot
who
asked
you
to
force
her
all
you
are
asked
to
do
is
not
to
interfere
and
leave
the
rest
to
myself
and
george
you
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
one
way
or
the
other
nor
will
any
responsibility
rest
with
you
besides
it
is
very
probable
that
your
cousin
will
live
down
his
fancy
or
some
other
obstacle
will
arise
to
put
an
end
to
the
thing
in
which
case
heigham
will
come
back
at
the
end
of
his
probation
and
events
will
take
their
natural
course
it
is
only
wise
and
right
that
you
should
try
the
constancy
of
these
young
lovers
instead
of
letting
them
marry
out
of
hand
if
on
the
other
hand
angela
should
in
the
course
of
the
year
declare
a
preference
for
her
cousin
surely
that
will
be
no
affair
of
understand
what
your
interest
is
in
this
matter
lady
dear
caresfoot
what
does
my
interest
matter
to
you
perhaps
i
have
one
perhaps
i
have
not
all
women
love
you
know
what
really
is
important
is
your
decision
and
she
shot
a
glance
at
him
from
the
eyes
only
to
recognize
that
he
was
not
convinced
by
her
arguments
or
if
convinced
obstinate
the
way
she
went
on
slowly
asked
me
to
make
a
payment
to
you
on
his
account
money
that
has
he
says
been
long
owing
but
which
it
has
not
hitherto
been
convenient
to
is
the
sum
asked
philip
abstractedly
large
one
a
thousand
it
did
not
require
the
peculiar
intonation
she
threw
into
her
voice
to
make
the
matter
clear
to
him
he
was
well
aware
that
no
such
sum
was
owing
is
the
cheque
she
went
on
and
taking
from
her
purse
a
signed
and
crossed
cheque
upon
a
london
banker
she
unfolded
it
and
threw
it
upon
the
table
watching
him
the
while
philip
gazed
at
the
money
with
the
eyes
of
a
hungry
wolf
a
thousand
pounds
that
might
be
his
for
the
asking
nay
for
the
taking
it
would
bind
him
to
nothing
the
greed
took
possession
of
him
as
he
looked
slowly
he
raised
his
hand
twitching
with
excitement
and
stretched
it
out
towards
the
cheque
but
before
his
fingers
touched
it
lady
bellamy
as
though
by
accident
dropped
her
white
palm
upon
the
precious
paper
suppose
that
heigham
will
leave
on
the
understanding
we
mentioned
she
said
carelessly
but
in
a
significant
tone
philip
nodded
the
hand
was
withdrawn
as
carelessly
as
it
had
come
leaving
the
cheque
blushing
in
all
its
naked
beauty
upon
the
table
philip
took
it
as
deliberately
as
he
could
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
then
rising
he
said
adding
as
he
passed
through
the
door
i
have
no
responsibility
in
the
matter
i
wash
my
hands
of
it
and
wish
to
hear
nothing
about
thousand
pounds
has
done
it
reflected
lady
bellamy
told
george
that
he
would
rise
greedily
at
money
i
have
not
watched
him
for
twenty
years
for
nothing
fancy
selling
an
only
happiness
in
life
for
a
thousand
pounds
and
such
a
daughter
too
i
wonder
how
much
he
would
take
to
murder
her
if
he
were
certain
that
he
would
not
be
found
out
upon
my
word
my
work
grows
quite
interesting
that
cur
philip
is
as
good
as
a
play
and
she
laughed
her
own
peculiar
laugh
chapter
xxx
into
guilty
thoughts
as
he
wended
his
homeward
way
we
will
not
inquire
and
indeed
for
all
the
warm
glow
that
the
thousand
pound
cheque
in
his
pocket
diffused
through
his
system
they
were
not
to
be
envied
perhaps
no
scoundrel
presents
at
heart
such
a
miserable
object
to
himself
and
all
who
know
him
as
the
scoundrel
who
attempts
to
deceive
himself
and
whilst
reaping
its
profits
tries
to
shoulder
the
responsibility
of
his
iniquity
on
to
the
backs
of
others
unfortunately
in
this
prosaic
world
of
bargains
one
can
not
receive
cheques
for
one
thousand
pounds
without
in
some
shape
or
form
giving
a
pro
now
was
to
rid
his
house
and
the
neighbourhood
of
arthur
heigham
his
guest
and
his
lover
it
was
not
a
task
he
liked
but
the
unearned
cheque
in
his
pocket
continually
reminded
him
of
the
obligation
it
entailed
when
arthur
came
to
smoke
his
pipe
with
his
host
that
evening
the
latter
looked
so
gloomy
and
depressed
that
he
wondered
to
himself
if
he
was
going
to
be
treated
to
a
repetition
of
the
shadow
scene
little
guessing
that
there
was
something
much
more
personally
unpleasant
before
him
philip
said
suddenly
and
looking
studiously
in
the
other
direction
want
to
speak
to
you
i
have
been
thinking
over
our
conversation
of
about
a
week
ago
on
the
subject
of
your
engagement
to
angela
and
have
now
come
to
a
final
determination
i
may
say
at
once
that
i
approve
of
you
in
every
here
his
heart
bounded
with
delight
under
all
the
circumstances
i
think
that
i
should
be
right
in
sanctioning
an
immediate
engagement
you
are
not
sufficiently
sure
of
each
other
for
that
i
may
seem
but
i
am
a
great
believer
in
the
virtue
of
constancy
and
anxious
in
your
own
interests
to
put
yours
and
to
the
test
the
terms
that
i
can
offer
you
are
these
you
must
leave
here
and
must
give
me
your
word
of
honour
as
a
i
know
will
be
the
most
effectual
guarantee
that
i
can
take
from
you
will
not
for
the
space
of
a
year
either
attempt
to
see
angela
again
or
to
hold
any
written
communication
with
her
or
anybody
in
any
way
connected
with
her
the
year
ended
you
can
return
and
should
you
both
still
be
of
the
same
mind
you
can
then
marry
her
as
soon
as
you
like
if
you
decline
to
accede
to
these
i
believe
to
be
to
your
mutual
ultimate
must
refuse
my
consent
to
the
engagement
a
silence
followed
this
speech
the
match
that
arthur
had
lit
before
philip
began
burnt
itself
out
between
his
fingers
without
his
appearing
to
suffer
any
particular
inconvenience
and
now
his
pipe
fell
with
a
crash
into
the
grate
and
broke
into
fit
symbol
of
the
blow
dealt
to
his
hopes
for
some
moments
he
was
so
completely
overwhelmed
at
the
idea
of
losing
angela
for
a
whole
long
year
losing
her
as
completely
as
though
she
were
dead
that
he
could
not
answer
at
length
he
found
his
voice
and
said
hoarsely
are
hard
can
not
argue
the
point
with
you
heigham
such
as
they
are
they
are
my
terms
founded
on
what
i
consider
i
owe
to
my
daughter
do
you
accept
them
can
not
answer
you
my
happiness
and
are
too
vitally
concerned
to
allow
me
to
do
so
i
must
consult
her
good
i
have
no
objection
but
you
must
let
me
have
your
answer
by
ten
had
arthur
only
known
his
own
strength
and
strength
that
honesty
and
honour
ever
have
in
the
face
of
dishonour
and
he
known
the
hesitating
feebleness
of
mind
how
easy
it
would
have
been
for
him
to
tear
his
bald
arguments
to
shreds
and
by
the
bare
exhibition
of
unshaken
purpose
to
confound
and
disallow
his
he
then
and
there
refused
to
agree
to
his
ultimatum
so
divided
was
philip
in
his
mind
and
so
shaken
by
superstitious
fears
that
he
would
have
accepted
it
as
an
omen
and
have
yielded
to
a
decision
of
character
that
had
no
real
existence
in
himself
but
he
did
not
know
indeed
how
could
he
know
and
he
was
besides
too
thorough
a
gentleman
to
allow
himself
to
suspect
foul
play
and
so
too
sad
for
talk
and
oppressed
by
the
dread
sense
of
coming
separation
from
her
whom
he
loved
more
dearly
than
his
life
he
sought
his
room
there
to
think
and
pace
to
pace
and
think
until
the
stars
had
set
when
wearied
out
at
length
he
threw
himself
into
bed
it
was
only
to
exchange
bad
for
worse
for
on
such
occasions
sleep
is
worse
than
wakefulness
it
is
so
full
of
dreams
big
with
coming
pain
shortly
after
dawn
he
got
up
again
and
went
into
the
garden
and
listened
to
the
birds
singing
their
matin
hymn
but
he
was
in
no
mood
for
the
songs
of
birds
however
sweet
and
it
was
a
positive
relief
to
him
when
old
jakes
emerged
his
cross
face
set
in
the
gladness
of
the
morning
like
a
sullen
cloud
in
the
blue
sky
and
began
to
do
something
to
his
favourite
bed
of
cabbages
not
that
arthur
was
fond
of
old
jakes
on
the
contrary
ever
since
the
conversation
which
betrayed
he
considered
a
malevolent
mind
he
detested
him
personally
but
still
he
set
a
fancy
value
on
him
because
he
was
connected
with
the
daily
life
of
his
betrothed
and
then
at
last
out
came
angela
having
spied
him
from
behind
the
curtains
of
her
window
clothed
in
the
same
white
gown
in
which
he
had
first
beheld
her
and
which
he
consequently
considered
the
prettiest
of
frocks
never
did
she
look
more
lovely
than
when
she
came
walking
towards
him
that
morning
with
her
light
proud
step
which
was
so
full
of
grace
and
womanly
dignity
never
had
he
thought
her
more
sweet
and
than
when
having
first
made
sure
that
jakes
had
retreated
to
feed
his
pigs
she
shyly
lifted
her
bright
face
to
be
greeted
with
his
kiss
but
she
was
quick
of
sympathy
and
had
learned
to
read
him
like
an
open
page
and
before
his
lips
had
fairly
fallen
on
her
own
she
knew
that
things
had
gone
amiss
what
is
it
arthur
she
said
with
a
little
pant
of
fear
brave
dear
and
i
will
tell
and
in
somewhat
choky
tones
he
recounted
word
for
word
what
had
passed
between
her
father
and
himself
she
listened
in
perfect
silence
and
bore
the
blow
as
a
brave
woman
should
when
he
had
finished
she
said
with
a
little
tremor
in
her
voice
will
not
forget
me
in
a
year
will
you
arthur
he
kissed
her
by
way
of
answer
and
then
they
agreed
to
go
together
to
philip
and
try
to
turn
him
from
his
purpose
breakfast
was
not
a
cheerful
meal
that
day
and
pigott
noticing
the
prevailing
depression
remarked
with
sarcasm
that
they
might
for
all
appearance
to
the
contrary
have
been
married
for
twenty
years
but
even
this
spirited
sally
did
not
provoke
a
laugh
ten
the
hour
that
was
to
decide
their
fate
came
all
too
soon
and
it
was
with
very
anxious
hearts
that
they
took
their
way
to
the
study
philip
who
was
seated
in
residence
appeared
to
view
arrival
with
some
uneasiness
course
angela
he
said
am
always
glad
to
see
you
but
i
hardly
beg
your
pardon
for
intruding
father
she
answered
as
this
is
very
important
to
me
i
thought
that
i
had
better
come
too
and
hear
what
is
as
it
was
evident
that
she
meant
to
stay
philip
did
not
attempt
to
gainsay
her
very
well
very
suppose
you
have
heard
the
terms
upon
which
i
am
prepared
to
consent
to
your
arthur
has
told
me
and
it
is
to
implore
you
to
modify
them
that
we
have
come
father
they
are
cruel
be
dead
to
each
other
for
a
whole
long
can
not
help
it
angela
i
am
sorry
to
inflict
pain
upon
either
of
you
but
i
have
arrived
at
them
entirely
in
your
own
interests
and
after
a
great
deal
of
anxious
thought
believe
me
a
probation
will
be
very
good
for
both
of
you
it
is
not
probable
that
where
my
only
child
is
concerned
i
should
wish
to
do
anything
except
what
is
for
her
happiness
arthur
looked
rebellion
at
angela
philip
saw
it
and
added
course
you
can
defy
is
i
believe
rather
the
fashion
for
girls
nowadays
to
do
if
you
do
you
must
both
clearly
understand
first
that
you
can
not
marry
without
my
consent
till
the
first
of
may
next
or
very
nearly
a
year
hence
when
angela
comes
of
age
and
that
i
shall
equally
forbid
all
intercourse
in
the
interval
and
secondly
that
when
you
do
so
it
will
be
against
my
wish
and
that
i
shall
cut
her
name
out
of
my
will
for
this
property
is
only
entailed
in
the
male
line
it
now
only
remains
for
me
to
ask
you
if
you
agree
to
my
angela
answered
him
speaking
very
slowly
and
clearly
accept
them
on
my
own
behalf
not
because
i
understand
them
or
think
them
right
or
because
of
your
threats
but
because
though
you
do
not
care
for
me
i
am
your
daughter
and
should
obey
believe
that
you
wish
to
do
what
is
best
for
me
that
is
why
i
accept
although
it
will
make
my
life
wretched
for
a
you
hear
what
she
says
said
philip
turning
to
arthur
you
also
agree
he
answered
boldly
and
with
some
temper
how
would
he
have
answered
could
he
have
seen
the
thousand
pound
cheque
that
was
reposing
upon
the
table
in
rusty
and
known
for
what
purpose
it
came
there
it
had
not
been
wish
i
would
never
have
agreed
i
think
your
terms
preposterous
and
i
only
hope
that
you
have
some
satisfactory
reason
for
them
for
you
have
not
shown
us
any
but
since
she
takes
this
view
of
the
matter
and
because
so
far
as
i
can
see
you
have
completely
cornered
us
i
suppose
i
must
you
are
her
father
and
can
not
in
nature
wish
to
thwart
her
happiness
and
if
you
have
any
plan
of
causing
her
to
forget
want
to
be
conceited
but
i
believe
that
it
will
here
angela
smiled
somewhat
sadly
unless
one
of
us
dies
before
the
year
is
up
i
shall
come
back
to
be
married
on
the
of
june
next
my
dear
heigham
your
way
of
talking
is
so
aggressive
that
some
fathers
might
be
tempted
to
ask
you
not
to
come
back
at
all
but
perhaps
it
is
under
the
circumstances
would
probably
think
so
if
you
were
in
my
place
blurted
out
arthur
give
me
then
your
word
of
honour
as
a
gentleman
that
you
will
attempt
either
in
person
or
by
letter
no
communication
with
angela
or
with
anybody
about
this
place
for
one
year
from
the
condition
that
at
the
end
of
the
year
i
may
return
and
marry
her
as
soon
as
i
your
marriage
can
take
place
on
the
of
june
next
if
you
like
and
care
to
bring
a
license
and
a
proper
of
half
your
you
answered
philip
with
a
half
smile
take
you
at
your
word
said
arthur
eagerly
is
if
angela
angela
made
no
signs
of
disagreement
on
those
terms
i
give
you
my
good
then
that
is
settled
and
i
will
send
for
a
to
take
you
to
the
four
train
i
fear
you
will
hardly
be
ready
for
the
i
shall
however
hope
he
added
have
the
pleasure
of
presenting
this
young
lady
to
you
for
good
and
all
on
this
day
next
year
for
the
present
i
shall
see
you
before
you
it
is
painful
to
have
to
record
that
when
arthur
got
outside
the
door
and
out
of
hearing
he
cursed
philip
in
his
grief
and
anger
for
the
space
of
some
minutes
to
linger
over
those
last
hours
could
only
be
distressing
to
the
sympathetic
reader
of
this
history
more
especially
if
he
or
she
has
ever
had
the
misfortune
to
pass
through
such
a
time
in
their
own
proper
persons
the
day
of
any
departure
is
always
wretched
but
much
more
is
it
wretched
when
the
person
departing
is
a
lover
whose
face
will
not
be
seen
and
of
whom
no
postman
will
bear
tidings
for
a
whole
long
year
some
comfort
however
these
two
took
in
looking
forward
to
that
joyous
day
when
the
year
of
probation
should
have
been
gathered
to
its
predecessors
and
in
making
the
most
minute
arrangements
for
their
wedding
how
angela
was
to
warn
fraser
that
his
services
would
be
required
where
they
should
go
to
for
their
honeymoon
and
even
of
what
flowers
the
wedding
bouquet
which
arthur
was
to
bring
down
from
town
with
him
should
be
composed
and
thus
the
hours
passed
away
all
too
quickly
and
each
of
them
strove
to
be
merry
in
order
to
keep
up
the
spirits
of
the
other
but
it
is
not
in
human
nature
to
feel
cheerful
with
a
lump
of
ice
upon
the
heart
dinner
was
even
more
dismal
than
breakfast
and
pigott
who
had
been
informed
of
the
impending
misfortune
and
who
was
distrustful
of
motives
though
she
did
not
like
to
add
to
the
general
gloom
by
saying
so
made
after
the
manner
of
people
a
painful
and
infectious
exhibition
of
her
grief
aleck
said
angela
when
the
time
drew
near
bending
down
over
the
dog
to
hide
a
tear
as
she
had
once
before
bent
down
to
hide
a
blush
aleck
i
shall
miss
you
almost
as
much
as
your
will
not
miss
him
angela
because
i
am
going
to
make
you
a
present
of
him
if
you
will
keep
is
very
good
of
you
dear
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
him
for
your
keep
him
love
he
is
a
good
dog
he
will
quite
have
transferred
his
allegiance
by
the
time
i
come
back
i
hope
you
have
done
the
same
arthur
why
will
you
so
often
make
me
angry
by
saying
such
things
the
sun
will
forget
to
shine
before
i
forget
love
i
did
not
mean
it
and
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
so
they
sat
there
together
under
the
oak
where
first
they
had
met
hand
in
hand
and
heart
to
heart
and
it
was
at
this
moment
that
the
reliant
strength
and
more
beautiful
serenity
of
character
as
compared
with
her
came
into
visible
play
for
whilst
as
the
moment
of
separation
drew
nigh
he
could
scarcely
contain
his
grief
she
on
the
other
hand
grew
more
and
more
calm
strengthening
his
weakness
with
her
quiet
power
and
bidding
him
seek
consolation
in
his
trouble
at
the
hands
of
him
who
for
his
own
purposes
decreed
it
she
said
in
answer
to
his
complainings
are
so
many
things
in
the
world
that
we
can
not
understand
and
yet
they
must
be
right
and
lead
to
a
good
end
what
may
happen
to
us
before
this
year
is
out
of
course
we
can
not
say
but
i
feel
that
all
love
is
immortal
and
that
there
is
a
perfect
life
awaiting
us
if
not
in
this
world
then
in
the
next
remember
dear
that
these
few
years
are
after
all
but
as
a
breath
to
the
general
air
or
as
that
to
the
waters
of
the
lake
when
compared
with
the
future
that
awaits
us
there
and
that
until
we
attain
that
future
we
can
not
really
know
each
other
or
the
true
meaning
and
purpose
of
our
love
so
look
forward
to
it
without
fear
dear
heart
and
if
it
should
chance
that
i
should
pass
out
of
your
life
or
that
other
ties
should
spring
up
round
you
that
shall
forbid
the
outward
expression
of
our
here
arthur
started
and
was
about
to
interrupt
but
she
stopped
him
not
start
arthur
who
can
read
the
future
stranger
things
have
happened
and
if
i
say
such
a
thing
should
come
about
in
our
case
then
remember
i
implore
you
that
in
that
future
lies
the
answer
to
the
puzzles
of
the
world
and
turn
your
eyes
to
it
as
to
the
horizon
beyond
which
you
will
find
me
waiting
for
you
and
not
only
me
but
all
that
you
have
ever
loved
only
dear
try
to
be
a
good
man
and
love
me
he
looked
at
her
in
wonder
he
said
has
made
you
so
different
from
other
women
with
all
whom
i
have
known
love
is
an
affair
of
passion
or
amusement
of
the
world
and
the
day
but
yours
gazes
towards
heaven
and
looks
to
find
its
real
utterance
in
the
stillness
of
eternity
to
be
loved
by
you
my
dear
would
be
worth
a
century
of
at
last
the
moment
came
as
all
moments
good
and
bad
must
come
to
pigott
who
was
crying
he
gave
a
hug
and
a
note
to
aleck
a
pat
on
the
head
to
philip
who
could
not
look
him
in
the
face
a
shake
of
the
hand
and
to
angela
who
bravely
smiled
into
his
long
last
kiss
but
when
the
cruel
wheels
began
to
crunch
upon
the
gravel
the
great
tears
welling
to
her
eyes
blotted
him
from
sight
blindly
she
made
her
way
up
to
her
room
and
throwing
herself
upon
the
bed
let
her
unrestrained
sorrow
loose
feeling
that
she
was
indeed
desolate
and
alone
chapter
xxxi
when
angela
was
still
quite
a
child
the
permanent
inhabitants
of
sherborne
lane
king
william
street
in
the
city
of
london
used
to
note
a
very
pretty
girl
of
small
stature
and
modest
ways
passing
out
evening
after
the
city
gentlemen
had
locked
up
their
offices
and
gone
the
quiet
of
the
lane
into
the
roar
and
rush
of
the
city
this
young
girl
was
mildred
james
the
only
daughter
of
a
struggling
a
very
struggling
city
doctor
and
her
daily
mission
was
to
go
to
the
cheap
markets
and
buy
the
provisions
that
were
to
last
the
sherborne
lane
household
for
her
father
lived
in
the
same
rooms
that
he
practised
in
for
the
ensuing
hours
the
world
was
a
hard
place
for
poor
mildred
in
those
days
of
provision
hunting
when
so
little
money
had
to
pay
for
so
many
necessaries
and
to
provide
also
for
the
luxuries
that
were
necessaries
to
her
invalid
mother
some
years
later
when
she
was
a
sweet
maiden
of
eighteen
her
mother
died
but
medical
competition
was
keen
in
sherborne
lane
and
her
removal
did
not
greatly
alleviate
the
pressure
of
poverty
at
last
one
evening
when
she
was
about
twenty
years
of
age
a
certain
carr
an
old
gentleman
with
whom
her
father
had
some
acquaintance
sent
up
a
card
with
a
pencilled
message
on
it
to
the
effect
that
he
would
be
glad
to
see
james
mildred
said
her
father
tell
carr
that
i
will
be
with
him
in
a
minute
it
will
never
do
to
see
a
new
patient
in
this
mildred
departed
and
gliding
into
the
gloomy
like
a
sunbeam
delivered
her
message
to
the
old
gentleman
who
appeared
to
be
in
some
pain
and
prepared
to
return
go
away
almost
shouted
the
aged
patient
have
crushed
my
finger
in
a
door
and
it
hurts
most
confoundedly
you
are
something
to
look
at
in
this
hole
and
distract
my
mildred
thought
to
herself
that
this
was
an
odd
way
of
paying
a
compliment
if
it
was
meant
for
one
but
then
old
gentlemen
with
crushed
fingers
are
not
given
to
weighing
their
words
you
daughter
he
asked
presently
i
have
lived
most
of
my
life
in
sherborne
lane
and
never
saw
anything
half
so
pretty
in
it
before
confound
this
finger
at
this
moment
the
doctor
himself
arrived
and
wanted
to
dismiss
mildred
but
carr
who
was
a
headstrong
old
gentleman
vowed
that
no
one
else
should
hold
his
injured
hand
whilst
it
was
dressed
and
so
she
stayed
just
long
enough
for
him
to
fall
as
completely
in
love
with
her
face
as
though
he
had
been
twenty
instead
of
nearly
seventy
now
carr
was
not
remarkable
for
good
looks
and
in
addition
to
having
seen
out
so
many
summers
had
also
buried
two
wives
it
will
therefore
be
clear
that
he
was
scarcely
the
suitor
that
a
lovely
girl
conscious
of
capacities
for
deep
affection
would
have
selected
of
her
own
free
will
but
on
the
other
hand
he
was
honest
and
hearted
and
what
was
more
to
the
point
perhaps
the
wealthiest
merchant
in
the
city
mildred
resisted
as
long
as
she
could
but
want
is
a
hard
master
and
a
arguments
are
difficult
to
answer
and
in
the
end
she
married
him
and
what
is
more
made
him
a
good
and
faithful
wife
she
never
had
any
cause
to
regret
it
for
he
was
kindness
itself
towards
her
and
when
he
died
some
five
years
afterwards
having
no
children
of
his
own
he
left
her
sole
legatee
of
all
his
enormous
fortune
bound
up
by
no
restrictions
as
to
about
this
time
also
her
father
died
and
she
was
left
as
much
alone
in
the
world
as
it
is
possible
for
a
young
and
pretty
woman
possessing
in
her
own
right
between
twenty
and
thirty
thousand
a
year
to
be
needless
to
say
carr
was
thenceforth
one
of
the
catches
of
her
generation
but
nobody
could
catch
her
though
she
alone
knew
how
many
had
tried
once
she
made
a
list
of
all
the
people
who
had
proposed
to
her
it
included
amongst
others
a
bishop
two
peers
three
members
of
parliament
no
less
than
five
army
officers
an
american
and
a
dissenting
clergyman
is
perfectly
marvellous
my
dear
she
said
to
her
companion
agatha
terry
fond
people
are
of
twenty
thousand
a
year
and
yet
they
all
said
that
they
loved
me
for
myself
that
is
all
except
the
dissenter
who
wanted
me
to
help
to
his
flock
and
i
liked
him
the
best
of
the
lot
because
he
was
the
carr
had
a
beautiful
house
in
grosvenor
square
a
place
in
leicestershire
where
she
hunted
a
little
a
place
in
the
isle
of
wight
that
she
rarely
visited
and
lastly
a
place
at
madeira
where
she
lived
for
nearly
half
the
year
there
never
had
been
a
breath
of
scandal
against
her
name
nor
had
she
given
cause
for
any
for
loving
she
would
say
only
things
she
loved
were
beetles
and
mummies
for
she
was
a
clever
naturalist
and
a
faithful
student
of
the
lore
of
the
ancient
egyptians
the
beetles
she
would
explain
had
been
the
connecting
link
between
the
two
sciences
since
beetles
had
led
her
to
scarabaei
and
scarabaei
to
the
human
husks
with
which
they
are
to
be
found
but
this
statement
though
amusing
was
not
strictly
accurate
as
she
had
in
reality
contracted
the
taste
from
her
late
husband
who
had
left
her
a
large
collection
of
egyptian
antiquities
do
adore
a
mummy
she
would
say
am
small
enough
in
mind
and
body
already
but
it
makes
me
feel
inches
smaller
and
i
like
to
measure
my
own
she
was
not
much
of
a
reader
life
was
she
declared
too
short
to
waste
in
study
but
when
she
did
take
up
a
book
it
was
generally
of
a
nature
that
most
women
of
her
class
would
have
called
stiff
and
then
she
could
read
it
without
going
to
sleep
in
addition
to
these
occupations
carr
had
had
various
crazes
at
different
stages
of
her
widowhood
which
had
now
endured
for
some
five
years
she
had
travelled
she
had
for
art
once
she
had
speculated
a
little
but
finding
that
for
a
woman
it
was
a
losing
game
she
was
too
shrewd
to
continue
this
last
pastime
but
she
always
came
back
to
her
beetles
and
her
mummies
still
with
all
her
money
her
places
her
offers
of
marriage
and
her
occupations
mildred
carr
was
essentially
weary
woman
sunk
deep
in
ease
and
sated
with
her
within
that
little
frame
of
hers
there
beat
a
great
active
heart
ever
urging
her
onwards
towards
an
unknown
end
she
would
describe
herself
as
an
regulated
woman
and
the
description
was
not
without
justice
for
she
did
not
possess
that
placid
even
mind
which
is
so
necessary
to
the
comfort
of
english
ladies
and
which
enables
many
of
them
to
bury
a
husband
or
a
lover
as
composedly
as
they
take
him
she
would
have
given
worlds
to
be
able
to
fall
in
love
with
some
one
to
fill
up
the
daily
emptiness
of
her
existence
with
joys
and
griefs
but
she
not
men
passed
before
her
in
endless
procession
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
them
and
for
the
most
part
were
anxious
to
marry
her
but
they
might
as
well
have
been
a
string
of
wax
dolls
for
aught
she
could
care
about
them
to
her
eyes
they
were
nothing
more
than
a
succession
of
and
tall
hats
full
of
shine
and
emptiness
signifying
nothing
for
their
opinion
too
and
that
of
the
society
which
they
helped
to
form
she
had
a
most
complete
and
headed
contempt
she
cared
nothing
for
the
ordinary
laws
of
social
life
and
was
prepared
to
break
through
them
on
emergency
as
a
wasp
breaks
through
a
web
perhaps
she
guessed
that
a
good
deal
of
breaking
would
be
forgiven
to
the
owner
of
such
a
lovely
face
and
more
than
twenty
thousand
a
year
with
all
this
she
was
extremely
observant
and
possessed
unknown
to
herself
great
powers
of
mind
and
great
though
dormant
capacities
for
passion
in
short
this
little
woman
with
the
baby
face
smiling
and
serene
as
the
blue
sky
that
hides
the
gathering
hurricane
was
rather
odder
than
the
majority
of
her
sex
which
is
perhaps
saying
a
great
deal
one
day
about
a
week
before
arthur
departed
from
the
abbey
house
agatha
terry
was
sitting
in
the
blue
in
the
house
in
grosvenor
square
when
carr
came
in
almost
at
a
run
slammed
the
door
behind
her
and
plumped
herself
down
in
a
chair
with
a
sigh
of
relief
give
orders
to
pack
up
we
will
go
to
madeira
by
the
next
gracious
mildred
across
that
dreadful
bay
again
and
just
think
how
hot
it
will
be
and
the
beginning
of
the
season
agatha
going
and
an
end
of
it
so
it
is
no
use
arguing
you
can
stay
here
and
give
a
series
of
balls
and
dinners
if
you
dear
me
give
parties
indeed
and
you
at
madeira
why
just
as
though
you
asked
ruth
to
entertain
the
reapers
without
naomi
go
and
give
the
orders
but
i
do
hope
that
it
will
be
calm
why
do
you
want
to
go
now
tell
you
lord
minster
has
been
proposing
to
me
again
and
announces
his
intention
of
going
on
doing
so
till
i
accept
him
you
know
he
has
just
got
into
the
cabinet
so
he
has
celebrated
the
event
by
asking
me
to
marry
him
for
the
third
fellow
perhaps
he
is
very
fond
of
a
bit
of
it
he
is
fond
of
my
good
looks
and
my
money
i
will
tell
you
the
substance
of
his
speech
this
morning
he
stood
like
this
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
said
am
now
a
cabinet
minister
it
is
a
good
thing
that
a
cabinet
minister
should
have
somebody
presentable
to
sit
at
the
head
of
his
table
you
are
presentable
i
appreciate
beauty
when
i
have
time
to
think
about
it
i
observe
that
you
are
beautiful
i
am
not
very
for
my
position
you
on
the
other
hand
are
immensely
rich
with
your
money
i
can
in
time
become
prime
minister
it
is
consequently
evidently
to
my
advantage
that
you
should
marry
me
and
i
have
sacrificed
a
very
important
appointment
in
order
to
come
and
settle
agatha
laughed
how
did
you
answer
him
his
own
style
minster
i
said
am
for
the
third
time
honoured
by
your
flattering
proposal
but
i
have
no
wish
to
ornament
your
table
no
desire
to
expose
my
beauty
to
your
perpetual
admiration
and
no
ambition
to
advance
your
political
career
i
do
not
love
you
and
i
had
rather
become
the
wife
of
a
that
i
loved
than
that
of
a
member
of
the
government
for
whom
i
have
respect
but
no
the
wife
of
a
it
is
probable
he
answered
you
would
be
miserable
as
my
wife
you
would
certainly
be
admired
and
powerful
and
consequently
minster
i
said
have
studied
human
nature
but
very
superficially
if
you
have
not
learnt
that
it
is
better
for
a
woman
to
be
miserable
with
the
man
she
loves
than
powerful
and
consequently
happy
with
one
who
has
no
attraction
for
remark
is
interesting
he
replied
i
think
that
there
is
something
paradoxical
about
it
i
must
be
going
now
as
i
have
only
five
minutes
to
get
to
westminster
but
i
will
think
it
over
and
answer
it
when
we
renew
our
conversation
which
i
propose
to
do
very
shortly
and
he
was
gone
before
i
could
get
in
another
why
should
that
make
you
go
to
madeira
my
dear
if
i
so
sure
as
i
am
a
living
woman
that
man
will
tire
me
out
and
marry
me
and
i
dislike
him
and
want
to
marry
him
i
have
a
strong
will
but
his
is
of
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
the
names
of
carr
miss
terry
and
three
servants
appeared
upon
the
passenger
list
of
donald
currie
royal
mail
steamship
due
to
sail
for
madeira
and
the
cape
ports
on
the
of
june
chapter
xxxii
arthur
arrived
in
town
in
a
melancholy
condition
his
was
a
temperament
peculiarly
liable
to
suffer
from
attacks
of
depression
and
he
had
with
some
excuse
a
sufficiently
severe
one
on
him
now
do
what
he
would
he
could
not
for
a
single
hour
free
his
mind
from
the
sick
longing
to
see
or
hear
from
angela
that
in
addition
to
the
mental
distress
it
occasioned
him
amounted
almost
to
a
physical
pain
after
two
or
three
days
of
lounging
about
his
he
was
in
no
mood
for
going
began
to
feel
that
this
sort
of
thing
was
intolerable
and
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
him
to
go
somewhere
or
do
something
it
so
happened
that
just
after
he
had
come
to
this
decision
he
overheard
two
men
who
were
sitting
at
the
next
table
to
him
in
the
club
talking
of
the
island
of
madeira
and
speaking
of
it
as
a
charming
place
he
accepted
this
as
an
omen
and
determined
that
to
madeira
he
would
go
and
indeed
the
place
would
suit
him
as
well
as
any
other
to
get
through
a
portion
of
his
year
of
probation
in
and
whilst
affording
a
complete
change
of
scene
would
not
be
too
far
from
england
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
arthur
found
himself
in
the
office
of
donald
currie
for
the
purpose
of
booking
his
berth
in
the
vessel
that
was
due
to
sail
on
the
there
he
was
informed
by
the
very
affable
clerk
who
assisted
him
to
choose
his
cabin
that
the
vessel
was
unusually
empty
and
that
up
to
the
present
time
berths
had
been
taken
for
only
five
ladies
and
two
of
them
jewesses
the
clerk
added
by
way
of
consolation
one
pointing
to
name
on
the
list
as
good
as
a
cargo
and
he
whistled
expressively
do
you
mean
asked
arthur
his
curiosity
slightly
excited
word
here
she
at
that
moment
the
swing
doors
of
the
office
were
pushed
open
and
there
came
through
them
one
of
the
sweetest
daintiest
little
women
arthur
had
ever
seen
she
was
no
longer
quite
young
she
might
be
eight
and
twenty
or
thirty
but
on
the
other
hand
maturity
had
but
added
to
the
charms
of
youth
she
had
big
brown
eyes
that
arthur
thought
could
probably
look
languishing
if
they
chose
and
that
even
in
repose
were
full
of
expression
a
face
soft
and
blooming
as
a
peach
and
round
as
a
surmounted
by
a
quantity
of
hair
the
very
sweetest
mouth
the
lips
rather
full
and
just
showing
a
line
of
pearl
and
lastly
what
looked
rather
odd
on
such
an
infantile
countenance
a
firm
square
and
very
determined
if
very
diminutive
chin
for
the
rest
it
was
difficult
to
say
which
was
the
most
perfect
her
figure
or
her
dress
all
of
which
of
course
had
little
interest
for
arthur
but
what
did
rather
startle
him
was
her
voice
when
she
spoke
from
such
a
woman
one
would
naturally
have
expected
a
voice
of
a
corresponding
nature
namely
one
of
the
soft
and
murmuring
order
but
hers
on
the
contrary
though
sweet
was
decided
and
clear
as
a
bell
and
with
a
peculiar
ring
in
it
that
he
would
have
recognized
amongst
a
thousand
others
on
her
entrance
arthur
stepped
on
one
side
have
come
to
say
she
said
with
a
slight
bow
of
recognition
to
the
clerk
i
have
changed
my
mind
about
my
berth
instead
of
the
starboard
deck
cabin
i
should
like
to
have
the
port
i
think
that
it
will
be
cooler
at
this
time
of
year
and
also
will
you
please
make
arrangements
for
three
am
excessively
sorry
carr
the
clerk
answered
the
port
cabin
is
fact
this
gentleman
has
just
taken
in
that
a
little
is
an
end
of
the
no
means
interrupted
arthur
is
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
me
where
i
go
i
beg
that
you
will
take
thank
you
you
are
very
good
but
i
could
not
think
of
robbing
you
of
your
must
implore
you
to
do
so
rather
than
there
should
be
any
difficulty
i
will
go
and
then
addressing
the
clerk
so
kind
as
to
change
the
owe
you
many
thanks
for
your
courtesy
said
carr
with
a
little
curtsey
arthur
took
off
his
hat
we
will
consider
that
settled
good
morning
or
perhaps
i
should
say
and
bowing
again
he
left
the
office
is
that
name
carr
asked
when
he
was
gone
it
is
madam
on
the
list
preston
heigham
passenger
to
preston
heigham
carr
said
to
herself
as
she
made
her
way
down
to
her
carriage
in
fenchurch
street
is
pretty
and
preston
is
pretty
but
i
much
like
heigham
at
any
rate
there
is
no
doubt
about
his
being
a
gentleman
i
wonder
what
he
is
going
to
madeira
for
he
has
an
interesting
face
i
think
i
am
glad
we
are
going
to
be
the
two
days
that
remained
to
him
in
town
arthur
spent
in
making
his
preparations
for
departure
getting
money
buying
after
the
manner
of
young
englishmen
starting
on
a
voyage
to
foreign
parts
a
large
and
fearfully
sharp
as
though
madeira
were
the
home
of
wild
beasts
and
laying
in
a
stock
of
various
other
articles
of
a
useless
description
such
as
impenetrable
and
leather
coats
the
boat
was
to
sail
at
noon
on
friday
and
on
the
thursday
evening
he
left
paddington
by
the
mail
that
reaches
dartmouth
about
midnight
on
the
pier
he
and
one
or
two
other
found
a
boat
waiting
to
take
them
to
the
great
vessel
that
painted
a
dull
grey
lay
still
and
solemn
in
the
harbour
as
they
were
rowed
up
to
her
very
different
from
the
active
living
thing
that
she
was
destined
to
become
within
the
next
hours
the
tide
ebbing
past
her
iron
sides
the
fresh
strong
smell
of
the
sea
the
tall
masts
pointing
skywards
like
gigantic
fingers
the
chime
of
the
bell
upon
the
bridge
the
sleepy
steward
and
the
stuffy
cabin
were
all
a
pleasant
variation
from
the
monotony
of
existence
and
contributed
towards
the
conclusion
that
life
was
still
partially
worth
living
even
when
it
could
not
be
lived
with
angela
indeed
so
much
are
we
the
creatures
of
circumstance
and
so
liable
to
be
influenced
by
surroundings
that
arthur
who
a
few
hours
before
had
been
plunged
into
the
depths
of
depression
turned
into
his
narrow
berth
after
a
tremendous
struggle
with
the
stewards
arrange
on
a
principle
incomprehensible
to
landlubbers
and
probably
only
partially
understood
by
considerable
satisfaction
and
a
pleasurable
sense
of
excitement
the
next
morning
or
rather
the
earlier
part
of
it
he
devoted
when
he
was
not
thinking
about
angela
to
arranging
his
goods
and
chattels
in
his
small
domain
to
examining
the
lovely
scenery
of
dartmouth
sight
of
which
is
enough
to
make
any
individual
bitterly
regret
his
determination
to
quit
his
native
and
to
inspecting
the
outward
man
of
his
with
that
icy
stolidity
which
characterizes
the
briton
but
the
great
event
of
the
morning
was
the
arrival
of
the
bringing
the
bags
destined
for
various
african
ports
loose
letters
for
the
passengers
and
a
motley
contingent
of
the
passengers
themselves
amongst
these
latter
he
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
the
two
jewesses
of
whom
the
clerk
in
the
office
had
spoken
who
were
accompanied
by
individuals
presumably
their
husbands
and
very
remarkable
for
the
splendour
of
their
diamond
studs
and
the
dirtiness
of
their
nails
the
only
other
specimen
of
womankind
that
he
could
see
was
a
pretty
girl
of
about
eighteen
who
was
as
he
afterwards
discovered
going
out
under
the
care
to
be
a
governess
at
the
cape
and
who
to
judge
from
the
intense
melancholy
of
her
countenance
did
not
particularly
enjoy
the
prospect
but
with
the
exception
of
some
heavy
baggage
that
was
being
worked
up
from
a
by
the
and
a
luxurious
on
the
deck
that
bore
her
name
no
signs
were
there
of
carr
presently
the
purser
sent
round
the
a
gentleman
whom
arthur
mistook
for
the
first
mate
so
smart
was
his
uniform
to
collect
the
letters
and
it
wrung
him
not
a
little
to
think
that
he
alone
could
send
none
the
bell
sounded
to
warn
all
not
sailing
to
hurry
to
their
boats
but
still
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
of
his
acquaintance
of
the
office
and
to
speak
the
truth
he
was
just
a
little
disappointed
for
what
he
had
seen
of
her
had
piqued
his
curiosity
and
made
him
anxious
to
see
more
wait
any
longer
he
heard
the
captain
say
must
come
on
by
the
it
was
full
twelve
and
the
last
rope
was
being
loosed
from
the
moorings
went
the
bell
started
the
great
screw
that
would
not
stop
again
for
so
many
restless
hours
the
huge
vessel
shuddered
throughout
her
frame
like
an
awakening
sleeper
and
growing
quick
with
life
forged
an
inch
or
two
next
a
quartermaster
came
with
two
men
to
hoist
up
the
gangway
when
suddenly
a
boat
shot
alongside
and
hooked
on
amongst
the
occupants
of
which
arthur
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
carr
who
sat
laughing
like
pleasure
at
the
helm
the
other
occupants
of
the
boat
who
were
not
laughing
he
guessed
to
be
her
servants
and
the
lady
who
figured
on
the
as
miss
terry
a
stout
person
in
spectacles
then
agatha
called
out
carr
from
the
quick
and
jump
dear
mildred
i
go
up
there
i
indeed
why
the
you
must
go
up
or
else
be
pulled
up
with
a
rope
here
i
will
show
the
way
and
moving
down
the
boat
she
sprang
boldly
as
it
rose
with
the
swell
into
the
stalwart
arms
of
the
sailor
who
was
waiting
on
the
gangway
and
thence
ran
up
the
steps
to
the
deck
well
i
am
going
to
madeira
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
do
but
you
must
make
up
your
mind
hold
on
much
longer
mum
said
the
boatman
getting
way
on
on
mum
i
let
you
in
said
the
man
of
the
ladder
seductively
dear
oh
dear
what
shall
i
do
groaned
miss
terry
wringing
the
hand
that
was
not
employed
in
holding
on
called
carr
to
a
servant
who
was
behind
miss
terry
and
looking
considerably
alarmed
stand
there
like
a
fool
put
miss
terry
on
to
that
carr
was
evidently
accustomed
to
be
obeyed
for
thus
admonished
john
seized
the
struggling
and
shrieking
miss
terry
and
bore
her
to
the
edge
of
the
boat
where
she
was
caught
by
two
sailors
and
amidst
the
cheers
of
excited
passengers
fairly
dragged
on
to
the
deck
carr
said
the
chief
officer
reproachfully
when
miss
terry
had
been
satisfactorily
deposited
on
a
bench
are
late
again
you
were
late
last
at
all
thompson
i
hate
spending
longer
than
is
necessary
aboard
ship
so
when
the
train
got
in
i
took
a
boat
and
went
for
a
row
in
the
harbour
i
knew
that
you
would
not
go
without
yes
we
should
have
carr
the
skipper
heard
about
it
because
he
waited
for
you
here
i
am
and
i
promise
that
i
do
it
thompson
laughed
and
passed
on
at
this
moment
carr
perceived
arthur
and
bowing
to
him
they
fell
into
conversation
about
the
scenery
through
which
the
boat
was
passing
on
her
way
to
the
open
sea
before
very
long
indeed
as
soon
as
the
vessel
began
to
rise
and
fall
upon
the
swell
this
talk
was
interrupted
by
a
voice
from
the
seat
where
miss
terry
had
been
placed
it
said
do
wish
you
would
not
come
to
sea
i
am
beginning
to
feel
no
wonder
if
you
will
insist
upon
coming
up
ladders
head
downwards
john
he
will
help
you
to
your
cabin
the
deck
one
next
to
but
john
had
vanished
with
a
parcel
send
some
one
quick
i
beg
of
you
remarked
miss
terry
in
the
solemn
tones
of
one
who
feels
that
a
crisis
is
approaching
see
anybody
except
a
very
dirty
me
said
arthur
stepping
to
the
rescue
are
very
kind
but
she
walk
i
know
her
ways
she
has
got
to
the
stage
when
she
must
be
carried
can
you
manage
her
think
so
replied
arthur
you
mind
holding
her
legs
and
provided
that
the
vessel
does
not
roll
and
with
an
effort
he
hoisted
miss
terry
into
his
arms
and
staggered
off
with
her
towards
the
indicated
cabin
carr
as
suggested
holding
the
lower
limbs
of
the
prostrate
lady
presently
she
began
to
laugh
you
only
knew
how
absurd
we
look
she
said
make
me
laugh
answered
arthur
puffing
for
miss
terry
was
by
no
means
light
i
shall
drop
you
do
young
man
ejaculated
his
apparently
unconscious
burden
with
wonderful
energy
will
never
forgive
a
remark
the
suddenness
of
which
so
startled
him
that
he
very
nearly
did
you
now
lay
her
quite
flat
please
she
get
up
again
till
we
drop
anchor
at
i
live
so
long
murmured
the
invalid
arthur
now
made
his
bow
and
departed
wondering
how
two
women
so
dissimilar
as
carr
and
miss
terry
came
to
be
living
together
as
it
is
a
piece
of
curiosity
that
the
reader
may
share
perhaps
it
had
better
be
explained
miss
terry
was
a
relative
of
late
husband
who
had
by
a
series
of
misfortunes
been
left
quite
destitute
her
distress
having
come
to
the
knowledge
of
mildred
carr
she
with
the
hearted
promptitude
that
distinguished
her
at
once
came
to
her
aid
paid
her
debts
and
brought
her
to
her
own
house
to
stay
where
she
had
remained
ever
since
under
the
title
of
companion
these
two
women
living
thus
together
had
nothing
whatsoever
in
common
save
that
miss
terry
took
some
reflected
interest
in
beetles
as
for
travelling
having
been
brought
up
and
lived
in
the
same
house
of
the
same
county
town
until
she
reached
the
age
of
it
was
as
may
be
imagined
altogether
obnoxious
to
her
indeed
it
is
more
than
doubtful
if
she
retained
any
clear
impression
whatsoever
of
the
places
she
visited
set
of
foreign
holes
as
she
would
call
them
contemptuously
miss
terry
was
in
short
neither
clever
nor
strong
minded
but
so
long
as
she
could
be
in
the
company
of
her
beloved
mildred
whom
she
regarded
with
mingled
reverence
and
affection
she
was
perfectly
happy
oddly
enough
this
affection
was
reciprocated
and
there
probably
was
nobody
in
the
world
for
whom
carr
cared
so
much
as
her
cousin
by
marriage
agatha
terry
and
yet
it
would
be
impossible
to
imagine
two
women
more
dissimilar
not
long
after
they
had
left
dartmouth
the
afternoon
set
in
dull
and
towards
evening
the
sea
freshened
sufficiently
to
send
most
of
the
passengers
below
leaving
those
who
remained
to
be
finally
dispersed
by
the
penetrating
drizzle
that
is
generally
to
be
met
with
off
the
english
coast
arthur
left
alone
on
the
heaving
deck
surveyed
the
scene
and
thought
it
very
desolate
around
was
a
grey
waste
of
tossing
waters
illumined
here
and
there
by
the
setting
rays
of
an
angry
sun
above
a
wild
and
windy
sky
with
not
even
a
in
all
its
space
and
in
the
far
distance
a
white
and
fading
line
which
was
the
shore
of
england
faint
it
grew
and
fainter
yet
and
as
it
disappeared
he
thought
of
angela
and
a
yearning
sorrow
fell
upon
him
when
he
wondered
sadly
should
he
again
look
into
her
eyes
and
hold
that
proud
beauty
in
his
arms
what
fate
awaited
them
in
the
future
that
stretched
before
them
dim
as
the
darkening
ocean
and
more
uncertain
alas
he
could
not
tell
he
only
felt
that
it
was
very
bitter
to
be
parted
thus
from
her
to
whom
had
been
given
his
whole
love
to
know
that
every
fleeting
moment
widened
a
breach
already
far
too
wide
and
not
to
know
if
it
would
again
be
narrowed
or
if
this
farewell
would
be
the
last
then
he
thought
if
it
should
be
the
last
if
she
should
die
or
desert
him
what
would
his
life
be
worth
to
him
a
consciousness
within
him
answered
and
in
a
degree
his
conclusion
was
right
for
although
it
is
fortunately
not
often
in
the
power
of
any
single
passion
to
render
life
altogether
worthless
it
is
certain
that
when
it
strikes
in
youth
there
is
no
sickness
so
sore
as
that
of
the
heart
no
sorrow
more
keen
and
no
evil
more
lasting
than
those
connected
with
its
disappointments
and
its
griefs
for
other
sorrows
life
has
salves
and
consolations
but
a
noble
and
enduring
passion
is
not
all
of
this
world
and
to
cure
its
sting
we
must
look
to
something
beyond
this
quackeries
other
griefs
can
find
sympathy
and
expression
and
become
absorbed
little
by
little
in
the
variety
of
issues
but
love
as
it
is
and
should
be
the
faint
ghost
that
arrays
itself
in
stolen
robes
and
says
am
love
but
love
the
strong
and
the
immortal
the
passkey
to
the
happy
skies
the
angel
cipher
we
read
but
can
not
love
as
this
and
there
is
none
other
true
can
find
no
full
solace
here
not
even
in
its
earthly
satisfaction
for
still
it
beats
against
its
mortal
bars
and
rends
the
heart
that
holds
it
still
strives
like
a
meteor
flaming
to
its
central
star
or
a
new
loosed
spirit
seeking
the
presence
of
its
god
to
pass
hence
with
that
kindred
soul
to
the
inner
heaven
whence
it
came
there
to
be
wholly
mingled
with
its
other
life
and
clothed
with
a
divine
identity
to
satisfy
the
aspirations
that
now
vaguely
throb
within
their
fleshly
walls
with
the
splendour
and
the
peace
and
the
full
measure
of
the
eternal
joys
it
knows
await
its
coming
and
is
it
not
a
of
this
knowledge
that
the
thoughts
of
those
who
are
plunged
into
the
fires
of
a
pure
devotion
fly
upwards
as
surely
as
the
sparks
nothing
but
the
dross
the
grosser
earthly
part
is
purged
away
by
their
sorrow
which
is
in
truth
a
discipline
for
finer
souls
for
did
there
ever
yet
live
the
man
or
woman
who
loving
truly
has
suffered
and
the
fires
burnt
out
has
not
risen
from
their
ashes
purer
and
better
and
holding
in
the
heart
a
bright
undying
hope
never
for
these
have
walked
upon
the
holy
ground
it
is
the
flames
from
the
altar
that
have
purged
them
and
left
their
own
light
within
and
surely
this
holds
also
good
of
those
who
have
loved
and
lost
of
those
who
have
been
scorned
or
betrayed
of
the
suffering
army
that
cry
aloud
of
the
empty
bitterness
of
life
and
dare
not
hope
beyond
they
do
not
understand
that
having
once
loved
truly
it
is
not
possible
that
they
should
altogether
lose
that
there
is
to
their
pain
and
the
of
their
hopes
as
to
everything
else
in
nature
an
end
object
shall
the
soul
be
immortal
and
its
best
essence
but
a
thing
of
air
shall
the
one
thought
by
day
and
the
one
dream
by
night
the
ethereal
star
which
guides
us
across
mirage
and
which
will
still
shine
serene
at
the
moment
of
our
fall
from
the
precipice
of
time
shall
this
alone
amidst
all
that
makes
us
what
we
are
be
chosen
out
to
see
corruption
to
be
cast
off
and
forgotten
in
the
grave
never
there
by
the
workings
of
a
providence
we
can
not
understand
that
mighty
germ
awaits
fruition
there
too
shall
we
know
the
wherefore
of
our
sorrow
at
which
we
now
so
often
wonder
there
shall
we
kiss
the
rod
that
smote
us
and
learn
the
glorious
uses
and
pluck
the
glowing
fruits
of
an
affliction
that
on
earth
filled
us
with
such
sick
longing
and
such
an
aching
pain
let
the
reader
forgive
these
pages
of
speculative
writing
for
the
subject
is
a
tempting
one
and
full
of
interest
for
us
mortals
indeed
it
may
chance
that
if
he
or
she
is
more
than
these
lines
may
even
have
been
read
without
impatience
for
there
are
many
who
have
the
memory
of
a
lost
angela
hidden
away
somewhere
in
the
records
of
their
past
and
who
are
fain
in
the
breathing
spaces
of
their
lives
to
dream
that
they
will
find
her
wandering
in
that
wide
eternity
where
human
barriers
fall
all
human
relations
end
and
love
ceases
to
be
a
chapter
xxxiii
the
morning
after
the
vessel
left
dartmouth
brought
with
it
lovely
weather
brisk
and
clear
with
a
fresh
breeze
that
just
topped
the
glittering
swell
with
white
there
was
however
a
considerable
roll
on
the
ship
and
those
poor
wretches
who
for
their
sins
are
given
to
were
not
yet
happy
presently
arthur
observed
the
pretty
thing
she
did
not
look
very
pretty
on
to
the
deck
and
attempt
to
walk
about
an
effort
which
promptly
resulted
in
a
fall
into
the
scuppers
he
picked
her
up
and
asked
if
she
would
not
like
to
sit
down
but
she
faintly
declined
saying
that
she
did
not
mind
falling
so
long
as
she
could
walk
a
did
not
feel
so
sick
when
she
walked
under
these
circumstances
he
could
hardly
do
less
than
help
her
which
he
did
in
the
only
way
at
all
practicable
with
one
so
weak
namely
by
walking
her
about
on
his
arm
in
the
midst
of
his
interesting
peregrinations
he
observed
carr
gazing
out
of
her
deck
cabin
window
looking
he
thought
pale
but
sweetly
pretty
and
rather
cross
when
that
lady
saw
that
she
was
observed
she
pulled
the
curtain
with
a
jerk
and
vanished
shortly
after
this
companion
vanished
too
circumstances
over
which
she
had
no
control
compelling
her
and
arthur
himself
sat
down
rather
relieved
but
he
was
destined
that
day
to
play
to
ladies
in
distress
presently
opened
and
that
lady
herself
emerged
therefrom
holding
on
to
the
he
had
just
begun
to
observe
how
charmingly
she
was
dressed
when
some
qualm
seized
her
and
she
returned
to
the
cabin
but
the
door
had
with
the
roll
of
the
vessel
and
she
could
not
open
it
impelled
by
an
agony
of
doubt
she
flew
to
the
side
and
to
his
horror
sprang
with
a
single
bound
on
to
the
broad
rail
that
surmounted
the
bulwark
netting
and
remained
seated
there
holding
only
to
a
little
rope
that
hung
down
from
the
the
ship
which
was
at
the
moment
rolling
pretty
heavily
had
just
reached
the
full
angle
of
her
windward
roll
and
was
preparing
for
a
heavy
swing
to
leeward
arthur
seeing
that
carr
would
in
a
few
seconds
certainly
be
flung
out
to
sea
rushed
promptly
forward
and
lifted
her
from
the
rail
it
was
none
too
soon
for
next
moment
down
the
great
ship
went
with
a
lurch
into
a
trough
of
the
sea
hurling
him
with
her
in
his
arms
up
against
the
bulwarks
and
to
say
truth
hurting
him
considerably
but
if
he
expected
any
thanks
for
this
exploit
he
was
destined
to
be
disappointed
for
no
sooner
had
he
set
his
lovely
burden
down
than
she
made
use
of
her
freedom
to
stamp
upon
the
deck
could
you
be
so
foolish
said
he
another
moment
you
would
have
been
flung
out
to
sea
pray
heigham
she
answered
in
a
cutting
and
sarcastic
voice
that
my
business
or
your
own
surely
it
would
have
been
time
enough
for
you
to
take
a
liberty
when
i
asked
you
to
jump
over
after
arthur
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
looked
could
look
dignified
when
he
liked
do
not
quite
understand
you
carr
he
said
with
a
little
bow
i
did
i
did
to
save
you
from
going
overboard
next
time
that
such
a
little
adventure
comes
in
my
way
i
hope
for
my
own
sake
that
it
may
concern
a
lady
possessed
of
less
rudeness
and
more
and
then
glaring
defiance
at
each
other
they
separated
she
marching
off
with
all
the
dignity
of
an
offended
queen
to
the
seclusion
that
a
cabin
grants
whilst
he
withdrew
moodily
to
a
bench
comforted
however
not
a
little
by
the
thought
that
he
had
given
carr
a
roland
for
her
oliver
bound
on
to
the
bulwarks
had
been
the
last
effort
of
that
prince
of
demons
rending
her
ere
he
left
when
the
occasion
for
remaining
there
had
thus
passed
away
she
soon
tired
of
her
cabin
and
of
listening
to
the
inarticulate
moans
of
her
beloved
agatha
who
was
a
most
faithful
subject
of
the
fiend
one
who
would
never
desert
his
manner
so
long
as
he
could
roll
the
tiniest
wave
and
sallying
forth
took
up
her
position
in
the
little
society
of
the
ship
but
between
arthur
and
herself
there
was
no
attempt
at
reconciliation
each
felt
their
wrongs
to
be
as
eternal
as
the
rocks
at
luncheon
they
looked
unutterable
things
from
different
sides
of
the
table
going
in
to
dinner
she
cut
him
with
the
sweetest
grace
and
on
the
following
morning
they
naturally
removed
to
situations
as
remote
from
each
other
as
the
cubic
area
of
a
mail
steamer
would
allow
very
much
so
but
not
quite
a
lady
i
should
say
reflected
arthur
to
himself
with
a
superior
smile
detest
him
said
carr
to
herself
least
i
think
i
do
but
how
neatly
he
put
me
down
there
is
no
doubt
about
his
being
a
gentleman
though
insufferably
these
uncharitable
thoughts
rankled
in
their
respective
minds
about
what
then
was
disgust
on
descending
a
little
late
to
luncheon
that
day
to
be
informed
by
the
resplendent
who
for
some
undiscovered
reason
always
reminded
him
of
the
captain
had
altered
the
places
at
table
and
that
this
alteration
involved
his
being
placed
next
to
none
other
than
carr
everybody
was
already
seated
and
it
was
too
late
to
protest
at
any
rate
for
that
meal
so
he
had
to
choose
between
submission
and
going
without
his
luncheon
being
extremely
hungry
he
decided
for
the
first
alternative
and
reluctantly
brought
himself
to
a
halt
next
his
avowed
enemy
but
surprises
like
sorrows
come
in
battalions
a
fact
that
he
very
distinctly
realized
when
having
helped
himself
to
some
chicken
he
heard
a
clear
voice
at
his
side
address
him
by
name
heigham
said
the
voice
have
not
yet
thanked
you
for
your
kindness
to
miss
terry
i
am
commissioned
to
assure
you
that
she
is
very
grateful
since
she
is
prevented
by
circumstances
from
doing
so
am
much
gratified
he
replied
stiffly
really
i
did
nothing
to
deserve
thanks
and
if
i
had
he
added
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
should
not
have
expected
what
a
cynic
you
must
be
she
answered
with
a
rippling
laugh
though
women
helpless
as
they
are
were
not
always
thankful
for
the
tiniest
attention
did
not
the
pretty
girl
with
the
black
eyes
thank
you
for
your
attentions
yesterday
for
instance
the
lady
with
the
brown
eyes
thank
me
for
my
very
necessary
for
instance
he
answered
somewhat
mollified
for
the
laugh
and
the
voice
would
have
thawed
a
human
icicle
and
with
all
his
faults
arthur
was
not
an
icicle
she
did
not
she
deferred
doing
so
in
order
that
she
might
do
it
better
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
help
me
and
i
daresay
that
you
saved
my
life
and
beg
your
pardon
for
being
so
cross
but
being
always
makes
me
cross
even
to
those
who
are
kindest
to
me
do
you
forgive
me
please
forgive
me
i
really
am
quite
unhappy
when
i
think
of
my
and
carr
shot
a
glance
at
him
that
would
have
cleared
the
passage
for
a
apologise
he
said
humbly
really
have
nothing
to
forgive
i
am
aware
that
i
took
a
liberty
as
you
put
it
but
i
thought
that
i
was
justified
by
the
is
not
generous
of
you
heigham
to
throw
my
words
into
my
teeth
i
had
forgotten
all
about
them
but
i
will
set
your
want
of
feeling
against
my
want
of
gratitude
and
we
kiss
and
be
can
assure
you
carr
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
i
should
like
better
when
shall
the
ceremony
come
off
you
are
laughing
at
me
and
actually
interpreting
what
i
say
literally
as
though
the
english
language
were
not
full
of
figures
of
speech
by
that
phrase
and
she
blushed
a
is
her
cheek
took
a
deeper
shade
of
meant
that
we
would
not
cut
each
other
after
bring
me
from
the
seventh
heaven
of
expectation
into
a
very
prosaic
world
but
i
accept
your
terms
whatever
they
are
i
am
exactly
half
an
hour
but
let
us
talk
sense
are
you
going
to
stop
at
madeira
how
long
know
till
i
get
tired
of
it
i
suppose
is
it
nice
madeira
i
live
there
half
the
then
i
can
well
believe
that
it
is
heigham
you
are
paying
compliments
i
thought
that
you
looked
above
that
sort
of
the
presence
of
misfortune
and
of
he
men
are
reduced
to
the
same
level
talk
to
me
from
behind
a
curtain
or
let
me
turn
my
back
upon
you
and
you
may
expect
to
hear
face
to
face
i
fear
that
you
must
put
up
with
neat
way
of
saying
that
you
have
had
enough
of
me
your
compliments
are
for
the
and
she
rose
leaving
arthur
rather
amused
after
this
they
saw
a
good
deal
of
each
is
to
say
they
conversed
together
for
at
least
thirty
minutes
out
of
every
sixty
during
an
average
day
of
fourteen
hours
and
in
the
course
of
these
conversations
she
learned
nearly
everything
about
him
except
his
engagement
to
angela
and
she
shrewdly
guessed
at
that
or
rather
at
some
kindred
circumstance
in
his
career
arthur
on
the
other
hand
learned
quite
everything
about
her
for
her
life
was
open
as
the
day
and
would
have
borne
repeating
in
the
newspaper
but
nevertheless
he
found
it
extremely
interesting
must
be
a
busy
woman
he
said
one
morning
when
he
had
been
listening
to
one
of
her
rattling
accounts
of
her
travels
and
gaieties
sprinkled
over
as
it
was
with
the
shrewd
remarks
and
illumined
by
the
keen
insight
into
character
that
made
her
talk
so
charming
no
one
of
the
idlest
in
the
world
and
a
very
worthless
one
to
boot
she
answered
with
a
little
sigh
why
you
change
your
life
it
is
in
your
own
hands
if
ever
you
think
so
i
doubt
if
life
is
in
their
own
hands
we
follow
an
appointed
course
if
we
did
not
it
would
be
impossible
to
understand
why
so
many
sensible
clever
people
make
such
a
complete
mess
of
their
existence
they
do
it
from
any
rate
you
have
not
made
a
mess
of
yours
and
your
appointed
course
seems
a
very
pleasant
and
the
sea
beneath
us
is
very
smooth
but
it
has
been
rough
before
and
will
be
rough
is
no
stability
in
the
sea
as
to
making
a
mess
of
my
life
who
knows
what
i
may
not
accomplish
in
that
way
prosperity
can
not
shine
down
fear
of
the
future
it
only
throws
it
into
darker
relief
myself
i
am
afraid
of
the
is
unknown
and
to
me
what
is
unknown
is
not
magnificent
but
terrible
the
present
is
enough
for
me
i
do
not
like
speculation
and
i
never
loved
the
and
as
they
talked
madeira
in
all
its
summer
glory
loomed
up
out
of
the
ocean
for
they
had
passed
the
and
by
night
and
for
a
while
they
were
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
one
of
the
most
lovely
and
verdant
scenes
that
the
world
can
show
before
they
had
well
examined
it
however
the
vessel
had
dropped
her
anchor
and
was
surrounded
by
boats
full
of
officials
boats
full
of
diving
boys
of
vegetables
of
wicker
chairs
and
tables
of
parrots
fruit
and
articles
too
numerous
to
mention
as
they
say
in
the
catalogues
and
they
knew
that
it
was
time
to
go
ashore
it
has
been
a
pleasant
voyage
said
carr
am
glad
you
are
not
going
am
will
come
and
see
me
will
you
not
look
there
is
my
house
and
she
pointed
to
a
large
white
house
opposite
leeuw
rock
that
had
a
background
of
glossy
foliage
and
commanded
a
view
of
the
sea
you
come
i
will
show
you
my
beetles
and
if
you
care
to
come
next
day
i
will
show
you
my
if
i
come
the
next
what
will
you
show
me
often
as
you
may
come
she
said
with
a
little
tremor
in
her
voice
shall
find
something
to
show
then
they
shook
hands
and
took
their
respective
ways
with
the
unfortunate
miss
terry
who
looked
like
a
resuscitated
corpse
to
the
that
was
waiting
for
her
and
he
in
the
boat
belonging
to
hotel
chapter
xxxiv
a
minute
or
two
after
the
boat
in
which
arthur
was
being
piloted
to
the
shore
under
the
guidance
of
the
manager
of
hotel
had
left
the
side
of
the
vessel
shot
up
alongside
of
them
its
gleaming
in
the
sunlight
like
polished
gold
on
the
deck
near
the
little
wheel
stood
carr
herself
and
by
her
side
her
martial
cloak
around
her
lay
miss
terry
still
as
any
log
heigham
said
carr
in
a
voice
that
sounded
across
the
water
like
a
silver
bell
forgot
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
find
your
way
to
my
place
by
yourself
so
i
will
send
down
a
to
fetch
you
you
have
to
travel
about
with
bullocks
here
you
know
and
before
he
could
answer
the
head
was
round
and
she
was
tearing
through
the
swell
at
the
rate
of
fourteen
knots
her
private
launch
said
the
manager
of
the
hotel
to
arthur
is
the
quickest
in
the
island
and
she
always
goes
at
full
steam
she
must
have
come
some
way
round
to
tell
you
that
too
her
place
over
carr
comes
here
every
year
does
she
not
yes
every
year
but
she
is
very
early
this
year
our
season
does
not
begin
yet
you
know
she
is
a
great
blessing
to
the
place
she
gives
so
much
away
to
the
poor
peasants
at
first
she
used
to
come
with
old
carr
and
a
wonderful
nurse
they
say
she
made
to
the
old
gentleman
till
he
she
entertain
much
as
a
rule
but
sometimes
she
gives
great
balls
splendid
affairs
and
a
series
of
that
are
the
talk
of
the
island
she
hardly
ever
goes
out
anywhere
which
makes
the
ladies
in
the
place
angry
but
i
believe
that
they
all
go
to
her
balls
and
dinners
mostly
she
spends
her
time
up
in
the
hills
collecting
butterflies
and
beetles
she
has
got
the
most
wonderful
collection
of
egyptian
curiosities
up
at
the
house
there
too
though
why
she
keeps
them
here
instead
of
in
england
i
am
sure
i
know
her
husband
began
the
collection
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
collected
all
his
life
and
she
has
gone
on
with
it
wonder
that
she
has
not
married
it
be
for
want
of
asking
if
half
of
what
they
say
is
true
for
according
to
that
every
single
gentleman
under
fifty
who
has
been
at
madeira
during
the
last
five
years
has
had
a
try
at
her
but
she
look
at
one
of
them
but
of
course
that
is
and
here
we
are
at
the
sit
steady
sir
those
fellows
will
pull
the
boat
had
it
not
been
for
the
and
uncomfortable
state
of
his
mind
that
took
the
flavour
out
of
all
that
he
did
and
persistently
thrust
a
skeleton
amidst
the
flowers
of
every
landscape
arthur
should
by
rights
have
enjoyed
himself
very
much
at
madeira
to
live
in
one
of
the
lofty
rooms
of
hotel
protected
by
thick
walls
and
cool
green
shutters
to
feel
that
you
are
enjoying
all
the
advantages
of
a
warm
climate
without
its
drawbacks
and
that
too
however
much
people
in
england
may
be
they
mostly
do
all
the
year
in
itself
a
luxury
and
so
it
is
if
the
day
is
hot
to
dine
chiefly
off
fish
and
fruit
and
such
fruit
and
then
to
exchange
the
for
the
cool
portico
with
the
sweeping
through
it
and
pipe
in
hand
to
sink
into
a
slumber
that
even
the
diabolical
shrieks
of
the
parrots
tied
by
the
leg
in
a
line
below
are
powerless
to
disturb
or
if
you
be
energetic
speak
of
madeira
may
stroll
down
the
little
terraced
walk
under
the
shade
of
your
vines
and
contemplate
the
growing
mass
of
greenery
that
in
this
heavenly
island
makes
a
garden
you
can
do
more
than
this
even
for
having
penetrated
through
the
brilliant
and
recruited
exhausted
nature
under
a
you
can
engage
in
true
english
fashion
in
a
game
of
tennis
which
done
you
will
again
seek
the
shade
of
the
creeping
vines
or
spreading
bananas
and
in
a
springy
hammock
take
your
earned
repose
all
these
things
are
the
quintessence
of
luxury
so
much
so
that
he
who
has
once
enjoyed
them
will
long
to
turn
forget
the
painful
and
laborious
past
and
live
and
die
at
oh
madeira
gem
of
the
ocean
land
of
mountains
that
foolish
men
love
to
climb
valleys
where
wise
ones
much
prefer
to
rest
and
of
smells
that
both
alike
abhor
madeira
of
the
sunny
sky
and
azure
sea
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
and
overflowing
with
population
if
only
you
belonged
to
the
country
on
which
you
depend
for
a
livelihood
what
a
perfect
place
you
would
be
and
how
poetical
one
could
grow
about
you
a
consummation
which
fortunately
for
my
readers
the
recollection
of
the
open
drains
the
priests
and
portuguese
officials
effectually
prevents
on
the
following
morning
at
twelve
punctually
arthur
was
informed
that
the
conveyance
had
arrived
to
fetch
him
he
went
down
and
was
quite
appalled
at
its
magnificence
it
was
in
form
built
to
hold
four
and
mounted
on
wooden
runners
that
glided
over
the
round
pebbles
with
which
the
madeira
streets
are
paved
with
scarcely
a
sound
and
as
smoothly
as
though
they
ran
on
ice
the
chariot
as
arthur
always
called
it
afterwards
was
built
of
beautiful
woods
and
lined
and
curtained
throughout
with
satin
whilst
the
motive
power
was
supplied
by
two
splendidly
harnessed
white
oxen
two
native
servants
handsome
young
fellows
dressed
in
a
kind
of
white
uniform
accompanied
the
sledge
and
saluted
arthur
on
his
appearance
with
much
reverence
it
took
him
however
some
time
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
to
embark
in
a
conveyance
that
reminded
him
of
the
description
of
galley
and
smelt
more
sweet
but
finally
he
got
in
and
off
he
started
feeling
that
he
was
the
observed
of
all
observers
and
followed
by
at
least
a
score
of
beggars
each
afflicted
with
some
peculiar
and
dreadful
deformity
or
disease
and
thus
in
triumphal
guise
they
slid
down
the
quaint
and
narrow
streets
squeezed
in
for
the
sake
of
shade
between
a
double
line
of
tall
houses
over
the
bridges
that
span
the
vast
open
drains
past
the
cathedral
down
the
promenade
edged
with
great
that
made
the
air
heavy
with
their
perfume
and
where
twice
a
week
the
band
plays
and
the
portuguese
officials
march
up
and
down
in
all
the
pomp
and
panoply
of
office
onward
through
the
dip
where
the
town
slopes
downwards
to
the
sea
then
up
again
through
more
streets
and
past
a
stretch
of
dead
wall
after
which
the
chariot
wheels
through
some
iron
gates
and
he
is
in
fairyland
on
each
side
of
the
there
spreads
a
garden
calculated
to
make
english
horticulturists
gnash
their
teeth
with
envy
through
the
bowers
of
which
he
could
catch
peeps
of
green
turf
and
of
the
blue
sea
beyond
here
the
cabbage
palm
shot
its
smooth
and
lofty
trunk
high
into
the
air
there
the
bamboo
waved
its
leafy
ostrich
plumes
and
all
about
and
around
the
soil
was
spread
like
an
indian
shawl
with
many
a
gorgeous
flower
and
many
a
splendid
fruit
arthur
thought
of
the
garden
of
eden
and
the
isles
of
the
blest
and
whilst
his
eyes
accustomed
to
nothing
better
than
our
poor
english
roses
were
still
fixed
upon
the
blazing
masses
of
pomegranate
flower
and
his
senses
were
filled
with
the
sweet
scent
of
orange
and
magnolia
blooms
the
oxen
halted
before
the
portico
of
a
stately
building
and
like
all
madeira
houses
then
the
slaves
of
the
chariot
assisted
him
to
descend
whilst
other
slaves
of
the
door
bowed
him
up
the
steps
and
he
stood
in
a
great
cool
hall
dazzling
dark
after
the
brilliancy
of
the
sunlight
and
here
no
slave
awaited
him
but
the
princess
of
this
fair
domain
none
other
than
mildred
carr
herself
clad
all
in
summer
white
and
with
a
smile
of
welcome
in
her
eyes
am
so
glad
that
you
have
come
how
do
you
like
madeira
do
you
find
it
very
hot
have
not
seen
much
of
it
yet
but
this
place
is
lovely
it
is
like
fairyland
and
i
believe
that
you
he
added
with
a
bow
the
fairy
again
heigham
well
i
was
the
sleeping
beauty
last
time
so
one
may
as
well
be
a
queen
for
a
change
i
wonder
what
you
will
call
me
next
me
see
shall
we
angel
heigham
stop
talking
nonsense
and
come
into
the
he
followed
her
laughing
into
an
apartment
that
from
its
noble
proportions
and
beauty
might
fairly
be
called
magnificent
its
ceiling
was
panelled
with
worked
timber
and
its
floor
beautifully
inlaid
with
woods
of
various
hue
whilst
the
walls
were
thickly
covered
with
pictures
chiefly
and
all
by
good
masters
he
had
however
but
little
time
to
look
about
him
for
a
door
opened
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
and
admitted
the
portly
person
of
miss
terry
arrayed
in
a
gigantic
sun
hat
and
a
pair
of
green
spectacles
she
seemed
very
hot
and
held
in
her
hand
a
piece
of
brown
paper
inside
of
which
something
was
violently
scratching
caught
him
at
last
she
said
he
did
avoid
me
all
last
year
caught
gracious
caught
what
asked
arthur
with
great
interest
why
him
that
mildred
wanted
she
replied
regardless
of
grammar
in
her
excitement
look
at
him
thus
admonished
arthur
carefully
undid
the
brown
paper
and
next
moment
started
back
with
an
exclamation
and
began
to
dance
about
with
an
enormous
red
beetle
grinding
its
jaws
into
his
finger
keep
still
do
pray
called
miss
terry
in
alarm
shake
him
off
on
any
account
or
we
shall
lose
him
for
the
want
of
a
little
patience
as
i
did
when
he
bit
my
finger
last
year
if
keep
him
quite
still
he
leave
go
and
ring
for
john
to
bring
the
chloroform
arthur
feeling
that
the
interests
of
science
were
matters
of
a
higher
importance
than
the
of
his
finger
obeyed
her
injunction
to
the
letter
hanging
his
arm
and
the
beetle
over
the
back
of
a
chair
and
looking
the
picture
of
silent
misery
still
if
you
please
heigham
quite
still
is
not
the
tenacity
interesting
doubt
to
you
but
i
hope
your
pet
beetle
is
not
poisonous
for
he
is
gnashing
his
pincers
together
inside
my
mind
we
will
treat
you
with
caustic
presently
mildred
laugh
so
much
but
come
and
look
at
him
lovely
john
please
be
quick
with
that
chloroform
this
sort
of
thing
happens
often
i
think
that
i
should
collect
beetles
from
choice
at
least
not
large
ones
groaned
arthur
dear
laughed
carr
never
saw
anything
so
absurd
i
know
which
looks
most
savage
you
or
the
make
all
that
noise
mildred
you
will
frighten
him
and
if
once
he
flies
we
shall
never
catch
him
in
this
big
here
fortunately
for
arthur
the
servant
arrived
with
the
required
bottle
into
which
the
ferocious
insect
was
triumphantly
stoppered
by
miss
terry
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
heigham
you
are
a
true
the
first
and
last
time
mumbled
arthur
who
was
sucking
his
finger
am
infinitely
obliged
to
you
too
heigham
said
carr
as
soon
as
she
had
recovered
from
her
fit
of
laughing
beetle
is
really
very
rare
it
is
not
even
in
the
british
museum
but
come
let
us
go
in
to
after
that
meal
was
over
carr
asked
her
guest
which
he
would
like
to
see
her
collection
of
beetles
or
of
mummies
you
carr
i
have
had
enough
of
beetles
for
one
day
so
i
vote
for
the
well
will
you
come
agatha
mildred
you
know
very
well
that
i
come
just
think
heigham
i
only
saw
the
nasty
things
once
and
then
they
gave
me
the
creeps
every
night
for
a
fortnight
as
though
those
horrid
egyptian
ugly
enough
when
they
were
alive
without
going
and
making
great
skin
and
bone
dolls
of
persists
in
believing
that
my
mummies
are
the
bodies
of
people
like
she
saw
in
egypt
last
so
they
are
mildred
that
last
one
you
got
is
just
like
the
boy
who
used
to
drive
my
donkey
at
one
that
died
you
believe
they
just
stuffed
him
and
said
that
he
was
an
ancient
king
ancient
king
indeed
and
miss
terry
departed
in
search
for
more
beetles
heigham
you
must
follow
me
the
museum
is
not
in
the
house
wait
i
will
get
a
in
a
minute
she
returned
and
led
the
way
across
a
strip
of
garden
to
a
detached
building
with
a
broad
verandah
facing
the
sea
scarcely
ten
feet
from
this
verandah
and
on
the
edge
of
the
sheer
precipice
was
built
a
low
wall
leaning
over
which
arthur
could
hear
the
wavelets
lapping
against
the
hollow
rock
two
hundred
feet
beneath
him
here
they
stopped
for
a
moment
to
look
at
the
vast
expanse
of
ocean
glittering
in
the
sunlight
like
a
sea
of
molten
sapphires
and
heaving
as
gently
as
an
bosom
is
very
lovely
the
sea
moves
just
enough
to
show
that
it
is
only
but
i
like
it
best
when
it
is
awake
when
it
blows
a
it
is
magnificent
the
whole
cliff
shakes
with
the
shock
of
the
waves
and
sometimes
the
spray
drives
over
in
sheets
that
is
when
i
like
to
sit
here
it
exhilarates
me
and
makes
me
feel
as
though
i
belonged
to
the
storm
and
was
strong
with
its
strength
come
let
us
go
the
entrance
to
the
verandah
was
from
the
end
that
faced
the
house
and
to
gain
it
they
passed
under
the
boughs
of
a
large
going
through
glass
doors
that
opened
outwards
into
the
verandah
carr
entered
a
room
luxuriously
furnished
as
a
boudoir
this
had
apparently
no
other
exit
and
arthur
was
beginning
to
wonder
where
the
museum
could
be
when
she
took
a
tiny
bramah
key
from
her
and
with
it
opened
a
door
that
was
papered
and
painted
to
match
the
wall
exactly
he
followed
her
and
found
himself
in
a
stone
passage
dimly
lighted
from
above
and
sloping
downwards
that
led
to
a
doorway
graven
in
the
rock
on
the
model
of
those
to
be
seen
at
the
entrance
of
egyptian
temples
heigham
she
said
flinging
open
another
door
and
stepping
forward
are
about
to
enter
hall
of
the
he
went
in
and
a
strange
sight
met
his
gaze
they
were
standing
in
the
centre
of
one
side
of
a
vast
cave
that
ran
right
and
left
at
right
angles
to
the
passage
the
light
poured
into
it
in
great
rays
from
skylights
in
the
roof
and
by
it
he
could
see
that
it
was
hollowed
out
of
the
virgin
rock
and
measured
some
sixty
feet
or
more
in
length
by
about
forty
wide
and
thirty
high
down
the
length
of
each
side
of
the
great
chamber
ran
a
line
of
six
polished
sphinxes
which
had
been
hewn
out
of
the
surrounding
granite
on
the
model
of
those
at
carnac
whilst
the
walls
were
elaborately
painted
after
the
fashion
of
an
egyptian
sepulchre
here
osiris
held
his
dread
tribunal
on
the
spirit
of
the
departed
here
the
warrior
sped
onward
in
his
charging
chariot
here
the
harper
swept
his
sounding
chords
and
here
again
crowned
with
lotus
flowers
those
whose
corpses
lay
around
held
their
joyous
festivals
in
the
respective
centres
of
each
end
of
the
stone
chamber
a
colossus
towered
in
its
silent
and
unearthly
grandeur
that
to
the
right
was
a
statue
of
osiris
judge
of
the
souls
of
the
dead
seated
on
his
and
holding
in
his
hand
the
source
and
the
sceptre
facing
him
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
was
the
effigy
of
the
mighty
ramses
his
broad
brow
encircled
by
that
kingly
symbol
which
few
in
the
history
have
worn
so
proudly
and
his
noble
features
impressing
those
who
gaze
upon
them
from
age
to
age
with
a
sense
of
scornful
power
and
melancholy
calm
such
as
does
not
belong
to
the
countenance
of
the
men
of
their
own
time
and
all
around
under
this
solemn
guardianship
each
upon
a
polished
slab
of
marble
and
enclosed
in
a
case
of
thick
glass
lay
the
corpses
of
the
egyptian
dead
swathed
in
numberless
wrappings
as
in
their
day
the
true
religion
that
they
held
was
swathed
in
symbols
and
in
mummeries
here
were
to
be
found
the
of
the
mysteries
of
isis
the
astronomer
whose
lore
could
read
the
prophecies
that
are
written
in
the
stars
the
dark
magician
the
renowned
warrior
the
noble
the
musician
with
his
cymbals
by
his
side
the
fair
maiden
who
said
her
cedar
of
love
and
sorrow
and
the
royal
babe
all
sleeping
the
same
sleep
and
waiting
the
same
awakening
this
princess
must
have
been
well
known
to
joseph
that
may
have
been
her
who
rescued
moses
from
the
waters
whilst
the
babe
belongs
to
a
dynasty
of
which
the
history
was
already
merging
into
tradition
when
the
great
pyramid
reared
its
head
on
fertile
plains
arthur
stood
awed
at
the
wonderful
sight
before
said
he
in
that
whisper
which
we
involuntarily
use
in
the
presence
of
the
dead
i
realize
my
own
the
thought
was
abruptly
put
but
the
words
represented
well
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
what
must
pass
in
the
mind
of
any
man
of
culture
and
sensibility
when
he
gazes
on
such
a
sight
for
in
such
presences
the
human
mite
of
fluttering
in
the
sun
and
walking
on
the
earth
that
these
have
known
and
walked
four
thousand
years
ago
must
indeed
learn
how
infinitely
small
is
the
place
that
he
occupies
in
the
tale
of
things
created
and
yet
if
to
his
culture
and
sensibility
he
adds
religion
a
word
of
living
hope
hovers
on
those
dumb
lips
for
where
are
the
spirits
of
those
that
lie
before
him
in
their
eternal
silence
answer
withered
lips
and
tell
us
what
judgment
has
osiris
given
and
what
has
thoth
written
in
his
awful
book
four
thousand
years
old
human
husk
if
thy
dead
carcass
can
last
so
long
what
limit
is
there
to
the
life
of
the
soul
it
held
you
collect
all
these
asked
arthur
when
he
had
made
a
superficial
examination
of
the
almost
countless
treasures
of
the
museum
no
carr
spent
half
his
long
life
and
more
money
than
i
can
tell
you
in
getting
this
collection
together
it
was
the
passion
of
his
life
and
he
had
this
cave
hollowed
at
enormous
cost
because
he
thought
that
the
air
here
would
be
less
likely
to
injure
them
than
the
english
fogs
i
have
added
to
it
however
i
got
those
papyri
and
that
beautiful
bust
of
berenice
the
one
in
black
marble
did
you
ever
see
such
hair
arthur
thought
to
himself
that
he
had
at
that
moment
some
not
far
from
his
heart
that
must
be
quite
as
beautiful
but
he
did
not
say
so
there
are
some
curious
things
and
she
opened
an
case
that
contained
some
discoloured
grains
and
a
few
lumps
of
shrivelled
substance
are
they
is
wheat
taken
from
the
inside
of
a
mummy
and
those
are
supposed
to
be
hyacinth
bulbs
they
came
from
the
of
that
baby
prince
and
i
have
been
told
that
they
would
still
grow
if
can
scarcely
believe
that
the
principle
of
life
must
be
people
say
you
know
that
the
principle
of
life
can
never
become
extinct
in
anything
that
has
once
lived
though
it
may
change
its
form
but
i
do
not
pretend
to
understand
these
things
however
we
will
settle
the
question
for
we
will
plant
one
and
if
it
grows
i
will
give
the
flower
to
you
choose
arthur
took
the
biggest
lump
from
the
case
and
examined
it
curiously
have
not
much
faith
in
your
hyacinth
i
am
sure
that
it
is
but
many
things
that
seem
more
dead
than
that
have
the
strangest
way
of
suddenly
breaking
into
life
she
said
with
a
little
sigh
it
to
me
i
will
have
it
planted
and
then
with
a
quick
glance
upward
wonder
if
you
will
be
here
to
see
it
think
that
either
of
us
will
see
it
bloom
in
this
world
he
answered
laughing
and
took
his
leave
chapter
xxxv
had
arthur
been
a
little
less
wrapped
up
in
thoughts
of
angela
and
a
little
more
alive
to
the
fact
that
being
engaged
or
even
married
to
one
woman
does
not
necessarily
prevent
complications
arising
with
another
it
might
have
occurred
to
him
to
doubt
the
prudence
of
the
course
of
life
that
he
was
pursuing
at
madeira
and
as
it
is
it
is
impossible
to
acquit
him
of
showing
a
want
of
knowledge
of
the
world
amounting
almost
to
folly
for
he
should
have
known
upon
general
principles
that
for
a
man
in
his
position
a
grizzly
bear
would
have
been
a
safer
daily
companion
than
a
young
and
lovely
widow
and
the
north
pole
a
more
suitable
place
of
residence
than
madeira
but
he
simply
did
not
think
about
the
matter
and
as
thin
ice
has
a
treacherous
way
of
not
cracking
till
it
suddenly
breaks
so
outward
appearances
gave
him
no
indication
of
his
danger
and
yet
the
facts
were
full
of
evil
promise
for
as
time
went
on
mildred
carr
fell
headlong
in
love
with
him
there
was
no
particular
reason
why
she
should
have
done
so
she
might
have
had
scores
of
men
handsomer
cleverer
more
distinguished
for
the
asking
or
rather
for
the
waiting
to
be
asked
beyond
a
certain
ability
of
mind
a
taking
manner
and
a
sympathetic
thoughtful
face
with
that
tinge
of
melancholy
upon
it
which
women
sometimes
find
dangerously
interesting
there
was
nothing
so
remarkable
about
arthur
that
a
woman
possessing
her
manifold
attractions
and
opportunities
should
unsought
and
without
inquiry
lavish
her
affection
upon
him
there
is
only
one
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
phenomenon
which
indeed
is
a
very
common
one
and
that
is
that
he
was
her
fate
the
one
man
whom
she
was
to
love
in
the
world
for
no
woman
worth
the
name
ever
two
however
many
she
may
happen
to
marry
for
this
curious
difference
would
appear
to
exist
between
the
sexes
the
man
can
attach
himself
though
in
varying
degree
to
several
women
in
the
course
of
a
lifetime
whilst
the
woman
the
true
woman
can
not
so
adapt
her
best
affection
once
given
like
the
law
of
the
medes
and
persians
it
altereth
not
mildred
felt
when
her
eyes
first
met
in
donald
office
that
this
man
was
for
her
different
from
all
other
men
though
she
did
not
put
the
thought
in
words
even
to
herself
and
from
that
hour
till
she
embarked
on
board
the
boat
he
was
continually
in
her
mind
a
fact
which
so
irritated
her
that
she
nearly
missed
the
steamer
on
purpose
only
changing
her
mind
at
the
last
moment
and
then
when
she
had
helped
him
to
carry
miss
terry
to
her
cabin
their
hands
had
accidentally
met
and
the
contact
had
sent
a
thrill
through
her
frame
such
as
she
had
never
felt
before
the
next
development
that
she
could
trace
was
her
jealousy
of
the
girl
whom
she
saw
him
helping
about
the
deck
and
her
consequent
rudeness
up
to
her
present
age
mildred
carr
had
never
known
a
single
touch
of
love
she
had
not
even
felt
particularly
interested
in
her
numerous
admirers
but
now
this
marble
galatea
had
by
some
freak
of
fate
found
a
heart
awkwardly
enough
without
the
semblance
of
a
supplication
on
the
part
of
him
whom
she
destined
to
play
pygmalion
and
when
she
examined
herself
by
the
light
of
the
flame
thus
newly
kindled
she
shrank
back
dismayed
like
one
who
peeps
over
the
crater
of
a
volcano
commencing
its
fiery
work
she
had
believed
her
heart
to
be
callous
to
all
affection
of
this
nature
it
had
seemed
as
dead
as
the
mummied
hyacinth
and
now
it
was
a
living
suffering
thing
and
all
alight
with
love
she
had
tasted
of
a
new
wine
and
it
burnt
her
and
was
bitter
sweet
and
yet
she
longed
for
more
and
thus
by
slow
and
sad
degrees
she
learnt
that
her
life
which
had
for
thirty
years
flowed
on
its
quiet
way
unshadowed
by
wing
must
henceforth
own
his
dominion
and
be
a
slave
to
his
sorrows
and
caprices
no
wonder
that
she
grew
afraid
but
mildred
was
a
woman
of
keen
insight
into
character
and
it
did
not
require
that
her
powers
of
observation
should
be
sharpened
by
the
condition
of
her
affections
to
show
her
that
however
deeply
she
might
be
in
love
with
arthur
heigham
he
was
not
one
little
bit
in
love
with
her
knowing
the
almost
irresistible
strength
of
her
own
beauty
and
attractions
she
quickly
came
to
the
it
was
one
that
sent
a
cold
chill
through
there
must
be
some
other
woman
blocking
the
path
to
his
heart
for
some
reason
or
other
arthur
had
never
spoken
to
her
of
angela
either
because
a
man
very
rarely
volunteers
information
to
a
woman
concerning
his
existing
relationship
with
another
of
her
sex
knowing
that
to
do
so
would
be
to
depreciate
his
value
in
her
eyes
or
from
an
instinctive
knowledge
that
the
subject
would
not
be
an
agreeable
one
or
perhaps
because
the
whole
matter
was
too
sacred
to
him
but
she
on
her
part
was
determined
to
probe
his
secret
to
the
bottom
so
one
sleepy
afternoon
when
they
were
sitting
on
the
museum
verandah
about
six
weeks
after
the
date
of
their
arrival
in
the
island
she
took
her
opportunity
mildred
was
sitting
or
rather
half
lying
in
a
chair
gazing
out
over
the
peaceful
sea
and
arthur
looking
at
her
thought
what
a
lovely
woman
she
was
and
wondered
what
it
was
that
had
made
her
face
and
eyes
so
much
softer
and
more
attractive
of
late
miss
terry
was
also
there
complaining
of
the
heat
but
presently
she
moved
off
after
an
imaginary
beetle
and
they
were
alone
heigham
mildred
said
presently
was
going
to
ask
you
a
question
if
only
i
can
remember
what
it
to
remember
what
it
is
about
cabbages
or
does
it
come
under
any
of
those
heads
i
remember
now
if
you
had
added
you
would
not
have
been
far
out
what
i
wanted
to
ask
and
she
turned
her
large
brown
eyes
full
upon
him
and
yawned
slightly
me
agatha
is
right
it
hot
i
am
waiting
to
give
you
any
information
in
my
to
be
sure
the
question
well
it
is
a
very
simple
one
who
are
you
engaged
to
arthur
nearly
sprang
off
his
chair
with
astonishment
makes
you
think
that
i
am
engaged
he
asked
she
broke
into
a
merry
peal
of
laughter
ah
if
he
could
have
known
what
that
laugh
cost
her
makes
me
think
that
you
are
engaged
she
answered
in
a
tone
of
raillery
of
course
you
would
have
been
at
my
feet
long
ago
if
it
had
not
been
so
come
be
reticent
i
shall
not
laugh
at
you
what
is
she
like
generally
a
first
question
about
a
rival
she
as
as
i
am
though
you
may
not
think
it
i
have
been
thought
is
quite
different
from
you
she
is
very
tall
and
fair
like
an
angel
in
a
picture
you
then
there
is
a
and
a
like
an
very
different
from
me
i
should
think
how
nicely
i
caught
you
out
and
she
laughed
again
did
you
want
to
catch
me
out
said
arthur
on
whose
ear
tone
jarred
he
could
not
tell
why
curiosity
and
a
natural
anxiety
to
fathom
the
reasons
of
your
sighs
that
is
all
but
never
mind
heigham
you
and
i
shall
not
quarrel
because
you
are
engaged
to
be
married
you
shall
tell
me
the
story
when
you
like
for
i
am
sure
there
is
a
not
this
afternoon
the
sun
has
given
me
a
headache
and
i
am
going
to
sleep
it
off
other
are
very
interesting
to
me
the
more
so
because
i
have
reached
the
respectable
age
of
thirty
without
being
the
subject
of
one
myself
and
again
she
laughed
this
time
at
her
own
falsehood
but
when
he
had
gone
there
was
no
laughter
in
her
eyes
nothing
but
tears
bitter
burning
tears
said
mildred
that
evening
am
sick
of
this
place
i
want
to
go
to
the
isle
of
wight
it
must
be
quite
nice
there
now
we
will
go
by
the
next
currie
dear
mildred
replied
miss
terry
aghast
you
were
going
back
so
soon
why
did
you
not
leave
me
behind
you
and
just
as
we
were
getting
so
nicely
settled
here
too
and
i
shall
be
so
sorry
to
say
to
that
young
heigham
he
is
such
a
nice
young
man
why
you
marry
him
i
really
thought
you
liked
him
but
perhaps
he
is
coming
to
the
isle
of
wight
too
oh
that
dreadful
bay
mildred
winced
at
miss
allusions
to
arthur
of
whom
that
lady
had
grown
extremely
fond
am
very
sorry
dear
she
said
hastily
i
am
bored
to
death
and
it
is
such
a
bad
insect
year
so
really
you
must
begin
to
pack
miss
terry
began
to
pack
accordingly
but
when
next
she
alluded
to
the
subject
of
their
departure
mildred
affected
surprise
and
asked
her
what
she
meant
the
astonished
agatha
referred
her
to
her
own
words
and
was
met
by
a
laughing
disclaimer
you
surely
did
not
think
that
i
was
in
earnest
did
you
i
was
only
a
little
really
mildred
got
so
strange
lately
that
i
never
know
when
you
are
in
earnest
and
when
you
are
not
though
for
my
part
i
am
very
glad
to
stay
in
peace
and
grown
strange
have
i
said
carr
looking
dreamily
out
of
a
window
that
commanded
the
with
her
hands
crossed
behind
her
i
think
that
you
are
right
i
think
that
i
have
lost
the
old
mildred
somewhere
or
other
and
picked
up
a
new
one
whom
i
indeed
remarked
miss
terry
in
the
most
way
without
having
the
faintest
idea
of
what
her
friend
was
driving
at
it
rains
i
suppose
that
he
come
he
how
stupid
you
are
heigham
of
course
you
always
mean
him
when
you
say
of
course
i
do
if
it
ungrammatical
it
is
miserable
this
afternoon
i
feel
wretched
why
actually
here
he
comes
and
she
tore
off
like
a
into
the
hall
to
meet
him
indeed
again
remarked
miss
terry
solemnly
to
the
empty
walls
am
not
such
a
fool
as
i
look
i
suppose
that
heigham
come
to
the
isle
of
it
is
perhaps
needless
to
say
that
carr
had
never
been
more
in
earnest
in
her
life
than
when
she
announced
her
intention
of
departing
to
the
isle
of
wight
the
discovery
that
her
suspicions
about
arthur
had
but
too
sure
a
foundation
had
been
a
crushing
blow
to
her
hopes
and
she
had
formed
a
wise
resolution
to
see
no
more
of
him
happy
would
it
have
been
for
her
if
she
could
have
found
the
moral
courage
to
act
up
to
it
and
go
away
a
wiser
if
a
sadder
woman
but
this
was
not
to
be
the
more
she
contemplated
it
the
more
did
her
passion
was
now
both
wild
and
hold
upon
her
heart
eating
into
it
like
acid
into
steel
and
graving
one
name
there
in
ineffaceable
letters
she
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
parting
from
him
and
felt
or
thought
she
felt
that
her
happiness
was
already
too
deeply
pledged
to
allow
her
to
throw
up
the
cards
without
an
effort
fortune
favours
the
brave
perhaps
after
all
it
would
declare
itself
for
her
she
was
modest
in
her
aspirations
she
did
not
expect
that
he
would
ever
give
her
the
love
he
bore
this
other
woman
she
only
asked
to
live
in
the
sunlight
of
his
presence
and
would
be
glad
to
take
him
at
his
own
price
or
indeed
at
any
price
man
she
knew
is
by
nature
as
unstable
as
water
and
will
mostly
melt
beneath
the
eyes
of
more
women
than
one
as
readily
as
ice
before
a
fire
when
the
sun
has
hid
his
face
yes
she
would
play
the
game
out
she
would
not
throw
away
her
happiness
without
an
effort
after
all
matters
might
have
been
worse
he
might
have
been
actually
married
but
she
knew
that
her
hand
was
a
difficult
one
to
lead
from
though
she
also
knew
that
she
held
the
great
beauty
practically
unlimited
wealth
and
considerable
fascination
of
manner
her
part
must
be
to
attract
without
repelling
charm
without
alarming
fascinate
by
slow
degrees
till
at
length
he
was
involved
in
a
net
from
which
there
was
no
escape
and
above
all
never
to
allow
him
to
suspect
her
motives
till
the
ripe
moment
came
it
was
a
hard
task
for
a
proud
woman
to
set
herself
and
in
a
manner
she
was
proud
but
alas
with
the
best
of
us
when
love
comes
in
at
the
door
pride
reason
and
sometimes
honour
fly
out
the
window
and
so
miss
terry
heard
no
more
talk
of
the
isle
of
wight
thenceforward
under
the
frank
and
open
guise
of
friendship
mildred
contrived
to
keep
arthur
continually
at
her
side
she
did
more
she
drew
from
him
all
the
history
of
his
engagement
to
angela
and
listened
with
words
of
sympathy
on
her
lips
and
wrath
and
bitter
jealousy
in
her
heart
to
his
enraptured
descriptions
of
her
beauty
and
perfections
so
benighted
was
he
indeed
that
once
he
went
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
he
should
when
he
and
angela
were
married
come
to
madeira
to
spend
their
honeymoon
and
dilated
on
the
pleasant
trips
which
they
three
might
take
together
thought
mildred
to
herself
would
be
once
too
he
even
showed
her
a
tress
of
hair
and
strange
to
say
she
found
that
there
still
lingered
in
her
bosom
a
sufficient
measure
of
vulgar
first
principles
to
cause
her
to
long
to
snatch
it
from
him
and
throw
it
into
the
sea
but
as
it
was
she
smiled
faintly
and
admired
openly
and
then
went
to
the
glass
to
look
at
her
own
brown
tresses
never
had
she
been
so
dissatisfied
with
them
and
yet
her
hair
was
considered
lovely
and
an
aesthetic
had
once
called
it
a
fool
she
muttered
stamping
her
little
foot
upon
the
floor
does
he
torture
me
so
mildred
forgot
that
all
love
is
blind
and
that
none
was
ever
blinder
or
more
headstrong
than
her
own
and
so
this
second
calypso
of
a
lovely
isle
set
herself
almost
as
unblushingly
as
her
prototype
to
get
our
very
unheroic
ulysses
into
her
toils
and
penelope
poor
penelope
she
sat
at
home
and
span
and
defied
her
lovers
but
as
yet
mean
conscious
of
none
of
those
things
he
was
by
nature
an
young
gentleman
who
took
matters
as
he
found
them
and
asked
no
questions
and
he
found
them
very
pleasant
at
madeira
or
rather
at
the
quinta
carr
for
he
did
everything
except
sleep
there
within
its
precincts
he
was
everywhere
surrounded
with
that
atmosphere
of
subtle
and
refined
flattery
flattery
addressed
chiefly
to
the
intellect
that
is
one
of
the
most
effective
weapons
of
a
clever
woman
soon
the
tables
were
loaded
with
his
favourite
books
and
no
songs
but
such
as
he
approved
were
ordered
from
london
he
discovered
one
evening
for
instance
that
mildred
looked
best
at
night
in
black
and
silver
and
next
morning
worth
received
a
telegram
requesting
him
to
forward
without
delay
a
large
consignment
of
dresses
in
which
those
colours
predominated
on
another
occasion
he
casually
threw
out
a
suggestion
about
the
erection
of
a
terrace
in
the
garden
and
shortly
afterwards
was
surprised
to
find
a
small
army
of
portuguese
labourers
engaged
upon
the
work
he
had
made
this
suggestion
in
total
ignorance
of
the
science
of
garden
engineering
and
its
execution
necessitated
the
removal
of
vast
quantities
of
soil
and
the
blasting
of
many
tons
of
rock
the
contractor
employed
by
carr
pointed
out
how
the
terrace
could
be
made
equally
well
at
a
fifth
of
the
expense
but
it
did
not
happen
to
take
exactly
the
direction
that
arthur
had
indicated
so
she
would
have
none
of
it
his
word
was
law
and
because
he
had
spoken
the
whole
place
was
for
a
month
overrun
with
dirty
labourers
whilst
to
the
great
detriment
of
miss
remaining
nerves
and
even
to
the
slight
discomfort
of
his
royal
highness
himself
the
air
resounded
all
day
long
with
the
terrific
bangs
of
the
blasting
powder
but
so
long
as
he
was
pleased
with
the
progress
of
the
improvement
mildred
felt
no
discomfort
nor
would
she
allow
any
one
else
to
express
any
it
even
aggravated
her
to
see
miss
terry
put
her
hands
to
her
head
and
jump
whenever
a
particularly
large
piece
of
ordnance
was
discharged
and
she
would
vow
that
it
must
be
affectation
because
she
never
even
noticed
it
in
short
mildred
carr
possessed
to
an
extraordinary
degree
that
faculty
for
blind
unreasoning
adoration
which
is
so
characteristic
of
the
sex
an
adoration
that
is
at
once
magnificent
in
the
entirety
of
its
own
and
extremely
selfish
when
she
thought
that
she
could
please
arthur
the
state
of
nerves
became
a
matter
of
supreme
indifference
to
her
and
in
the
same
way
had
she
been
an
absolute
monarch
she
would
have
spent
the
lives
of
thousands
and
shaken
empires
till
thrones
came
tumbling
down
like
apples
in
the
wind
if
she
had
believed
that
she
could
thereby
advance
herself
in
his
affections
but
as
it
never
occurred
to
arthur
that
carr
might
be
in
love
with
him
he
saw
nothing
abnormal
about
all
this
not
that
he
was
conceited
for
nobody
was
ever
less
so
but
it
is
wonderful
what
an
amount
of
flattery
and
attention
men
will
accept
from
women
as
their
simple
right
if
the
other
sex
possesses
the
faculty
of
admiration
we
in
compensation
are
perfectly
endowed
with
that
of
receiving
it
with
careless
ease
and
when
we
fall
in
with
some
goddess
who
is
foolish
enough
to
worship
and
to
whom
should
be
on
our
knees
we
merely
label
her
and
say
that
she
from
all
of
which
wise
reflections
the
reader
will
gather
that
our
friend
arthur
was
not
a
hundred
miles
off
an
awkward
situation
chapter
xxxvi
one
day
some
three
weeks
after
arthur
had
gone
angela
strolled
down
the
tunnel
walk
now
in
the
height
of
summer
almost
dark
with
the
shade
of
the
and
settled
herself
on
one
of
the
stone
seats
under
staff
she
had
a
book
in
hand
but
it
soon
became
clear
that
she
had
come
to
this
secluded
spot
to
think
rather
than
read
for
it
fell
unopened
from
her
hand
and
her
grey
eyes
were
full
of
a
look
as
they
gazed
across
the
lake
glittering
in
the
sunlight
away
towards
the
hazy
purple
outline
of
the
distant
hills
her
face
was
quite
calm
but
it
was
not
that
of
a
happy
person
indeed
it
gave
a
distinct
idea
of
mental
suffering
all
grief
however
acute
is
subject
to
fixed
gradations
and
angela
was
yet
in
the
second
stage
first
there
is
the
acute
stage
when
the
heart
aches
with
a
physical
pain
and
the
mind
filled
with
a
wild
yearning
or
tortured
by
an
unceasing
anxiety
nigh
gives
beneath
the
abnormal
strain
this
does
not
last
long
or
it
would
kill
or
drive
us
to
the
then
comes
that
long
epoch
of
dull
misery
enduring
till
at
last
kindly
nature
in
pity
rubs
off
the
rough
extremes
of
our
calamity
and
by
slow
but
sure
degrees
softens
agony
into
sorrow
this
was
what
she
was
now
passing
through
all
highly
organized
natures
like
her
own
are
especially
in
youth
very
sensitive
to
those
more
exquisite
vibrations
of
pain
and
happiness
that
leave
minds
of
a
coarser
fibre
comparatively
may
be
taken
for
granted
that
she
was
suffering
sufficiently
acutely
perhaps
she
had
never
quite
realized
how
necessary
arthur
had
become
to
her
how
deep
his
love
had
sent
its
fibres
into
her
heart
and
inner
self
until
he
was
violently
wrenched
away
from
her
and
she
lost
all
sight
and
knowledge
of
him
in
the
darkness
of
the
outside
world
still
she
had
made
no
show
of
her
sorrow
but
once
when
pigott
told
her
some
pathetic
story
of
the
death
of
a
little
child
in
the
village
she
burst
into
a
paroxysm
of
weeping
the
pity
for
pain
had
loosed
the
of
her
own
but
it
was
a
performance
that
she
did
not
repeat
but
angela
had
her
anxieties
as
well
as
her
griefs
and
it
was
over
these
former
that
she
was
thinking
as
she
sat
on
the
great
stone
under
the
oak
love
is
a
wonderful
quickener
of
the
perceptions
and
ignorant
as
she
was
of
all
the
ways
the
more
she
thought
over
the
terms
imposed
by
her
father
upon
her
engagement
the
more
distrustful
did
she
grow
lady
bellamy
too
had
been
to
see
her
twice
and
on
each
occasion
had
inspired
her
with
a
lively
sense
of
fear
and
repugnance
during
the
first
of
these
visits
she
had
shown
a
perfect
acquaintance
with
the
circumstances
of
her
engagement
her
with
heigham
as
she
was
pleased
to
call
it
during
the
second
call
too
she
had
been
full
of
strange
remarks
about
her
cousin
george
talking
mysteriously
of
that
had
come
over
him
since
his
illness
and
of
his
being
under
a
nor
was
this
all
for
on
the
very
next
day
when
she
was
out
walking
with
pigott
in
the
village
she
had
met
george
himself
and
he
had
insisted
upon
entering
into
a
long
rambling
conversation
with
her
and
on
looking
at
her
in
a
way
that
made
her
feel
perfectly
sick
aleck
she
said
aloud
to
the
dog
that
was
sitting
by
her
side
with
his
head
upon
her
knee
for
he
was
now
her
constant
companion
wonder
where
your
master
is
your
master
and
mine
aleck
would
to
god
that
he
were
back
here
to
protect
me
for
i
am
growing
afraid
i
know
of
what
aleck
and
there
are
eleven
long
silent
months
to
at
this
moment
the
dog
raised
his
head
listened
and
sprang
round
with
an
angry
angela
rose
up
with
a
flash
of
hope
in
her
eyes
turned
and
faced
george
caresfoot
he
was
still
pale
and
shrivelled
from
the
effects
of
his
illness
but
otherwise
little
changed
except
that
the
eyes
glittered
with
a
fierce
determination
and
that
the
features
had
attained
that
fixity
and
strength
which
sometimes
come
to
those
who
are
bent
heart
and
soul
upon
an
enterprise
be
it
good
or
evil
i
have
found
you
out
at
last
cousin
angela
what
are
you
not
going
to
shake
hands
with
me
angela
touched
his
fingers
with
her
own
father
is
not
here
she
said
you
my
dear
cousin
but
i
did
not
come
to
see
your
father
of
whom
i
have
seen
plenty
in
the
course
of
my
life
and
shall
doubtless
see
more
i
came
to
see
you
of
whom
i
can
never
see
understand
you
said
angela
defiantly
folding
her
arms
across
her
bosom
and
looking
him
full
in
the
face
with
fearless
eyes
for
her
instinct
warned
her
that
she
was
in
danger
and
also
that
whatever
she
might
feel
she
must
not
show
that
she
was
afraid
shall
hope
to
make
you
do
so
before
long
he
replied
with
a
meaning
glance
you
are
not
very
polite
you
know
you
do
not
offer
me
a
beg
your
pardon
i
did
not
know
that
you
wanted
to
sit
down
i
can
only
offer
you
a
choice
of
those
call
that
brute
away
and
i
will
sit
dog
is
not
a
brute
as
you
mean
it
but
i
should
not
speak
of
him
like
that
if
i
were
you
he
is
sensible
as
a
human
being
and
might
resent
angela
knew
that
george
was
a
coward
about
dogs
and
at
that
moment
as
though
to
confirm
her
words
aleck
growled
slightly
indeed
well
he
is
certainly
a
handsome
dog
and
he
sat
down
suspiciously
you
come
and
sit
down
you
i
prefer
to
you
know
what
you
look
like
standing
there
with
your
arms
crossed
you
look
like
an
angry
you
mean
that
seriously
i
understand
you
if
it
is
a
compliment
i
like
are
not
very
friendly
said
george
whose
temper
was
fast
getting
the
better
of
him
am
sorry
i
do
not
wish
to
be
i
hear
that
my
ward
has
been
staying
here
whilst
i
was
he
was
staying
i
am
also
told
that
there
was
some
love
affair
between
you
i
suppose
that
he
indulged
in
a
flirtation
to
wile
away
the
angela
turned
upon
him
too
angry
to
speak
you
need
not
look
at
me
like
that
you
surely
never
expect
to
see
him
again
do
you
we
both
live
i
shall
certainly
see
him
again
indeed
i
shall
in
any
will
never
see
him
not
he
was
only
flirting
and
playing
the
fool
with
you
he
is
a
notorious
flirt
and
to
my
certain
knowledge
has
been
engaged
to
two
women
do
not
believe
that
that
is
true
or
if
it
is
true
it
is
not
all
the
truth
but
true
or
untrue
i
am
not
going
to
discuss
heigham
with
you
or
allow
myself
to
be
influenced
by
stories
told
behind
his
said
george
rising
and
seizing
her
hand
she
turned
quite
pale
and
a
shudder
passed
over
her
frame
my
hand
alone
and
never
dare
to
touch
me
again
this
is
the
second
time
that
you
have
tried
to
insult
answered
george
furious
with
outraged
pride
and
baffled
passion
set
up
your
will
against
mine
do
you
very
well
you
shall
see
i
will
crush
you
to
powder
insult
you
indeed
how
often
did
that
young
blackguard
insult
you
i
warrant
he
did
more
than
take
your
answered
angela
mean
heigham
i
shall
leave
you
to
consider
whether
that
term
is
not
more
applicable
to
the
person
who
does
his
best
to
outrage
an
unprotected
woman
and
take
advantage
of
the
absent
than
to
the
gentleman
against
whom
you
have
used
it
and
darting
on
him
one
glance
of
supreme
contempt
she
swept
away
like
an
angry
queen
left
to
his
meditations
george
shook
his
fist
towards
where
she
had
vanished
well
my
fine
lady
very
well
he
said
aloud
treat
me
as
so
much
dirt
do
you
you
shall
smart
for
this
so
sure
as
my
name
is
george
caresfoot
only
wait
till
you
are
in
my
power
and
you
shall
learn
that
i
was
never
yet
defied
with
impunity
oh
and
you
shall
learn
many
other
things
from
that
time
forward
angela
was
for
a
period
of
two
months
or
more
subjected
to
an
organized
persecution
as
harassing
as
it
was
cruel
george
waylaid
her
everywhere
and
twice
actually
succeeded
in
entering
into
conversation
with
her
but
on
both
occasions
she
managed
to
escape
from
him
before
he
could
proceed
any
further
so
persistently
did
he
hunt
her
that
at
last
the
wretched
girl
was
driven
to
hide
herself
away
in
odd
corners
of
the
house
and
woods
in
order
to
keep
out
of
his
way
then
he
took
to
writing
her
letters
and
sending
handsome
presents
all
of
which
she
returned
poor
angela
it
was
hard
both
to
lose
her
lover
and
to
suffer
daily
from
the
persecutions
of
her
hateful
cousin
which
were
now
pushed
forward
so
openly
and
with
such
pertinacity
as
to
fill
her
with
vague
alarm
what
made
her
position
worse
was
that
she
had
no
one
in
whom
to
confide
for
fraser
had
not
yet
returned
pigott
indeed
knew
more
or
less
what
was
going
on
but
she
could
do
nothing
except
bewail
absence
and
tell
her
to
there
remained
her
father
but
with
him
she
had
never
been
on
sufficiently
intimate
terms
for
confidence
indeed
as
time
went
on
the
suspicion
gathered
strength
in
her
mind
that
he
was
privy
to
advances
and
that
those
advances
had
something
to
do
with
the
harsh
terms
imposed
upon
arthur
and
herself
but
at
last
matters
grew
so
bad
that
having
no
other
refuge
she
determined
to
appeal
to
him
for
protection
she
said
boldly
one
day
to
philip
as
he
was
sitting
writing
in
his
study
cousin
george
is
persecuting
me
every
day
i
have
borne
it
as
long
as
i
can
but
i
can
bear
it
no
longer
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
protect
me
from
angela
i
should
have
thought
that
you
were
perfectly
capable
of
protecting
yourself
what
is
he
persecuting
you
about
what
does
he
want
marry
me
i
suppose
answered
angela
blushing
to
her
eyes
that
is
a
very
complimentary
wish
on
his
part
and
i
can
tell
you
what
it
is
angela
if
only
you
could
get
that
young
heigham
out
of
your
head
you
might
do
a
deal
is
quite
useless
to
talk
to
me
like
that
she
answered
coldly
that
is
your
affair
but
it
is
very
ridiculous
of
you
to
come
and
ask
me
to
protect
you
the
woman
must
indeed
be
a
fool
who
can
not
protect
and
so
the
interview
ended
next
day
lady
bellamy
called
again
dear
child
she
said
to
angela
are
not
looking
well
this
business
worries
you
no
doubt
it
is
the
old
struggle
between
duty
and
inclination
that
we
have
most
of
us
gone
through
well
there
is
one
consolation
nobody
who
ever
did
his
or
her
duty
regardless
of
inclination
ever
regretted
it
in
the
do
you
mean
lady
bellamy
when
you
talk
about
my
duty
mean
the
plain
duty
that
lies
before
you
of
marrying
your
cousin
george
and
of
throwing
up
this
young
recognize
no
such
dear
angela
do
look
at
the
matter
from
a
sensible
point
of
view
think
what
a
good
thing
it
would
be
for
your
father
and
remember
too
that
it
would
all
the
property
if
ever
a
girl
had
a
clear
duty
to
perform
you
you
insist
so
much
upon
my
i
must
say
that
it
seems
to
me
that
an
honest
girl
in
my
position
has
three
duties
to
consider
and
not
one
as
you
say
lady
bellamy
first
there
is
her
duty
to
the
man
she
loves
for
her
the
greatest
duty
of
any
in
the
world
next
her
duty
to
herself
for
her
happiness
and
are
involved
in
her
decision
and
lastly
her
duty
to
her
family
i
put
the
family
last
because
after
all
it
is
she
who
gets
married
not
her
lady
bellamy
smiled
a
little
argue
well
but
there
is
one
thing
that
you
overlook
though
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
pain
you
by
saying
it
young
heigham
is
no
better
than
he
should
be
i
have
made
inquiries
about
him
and
think
that
i
ought
to
tell
you
do
you
mean
mean
that
his
life
young
as
he
is
has
not
been
so
creditable
as
it
might
have
been
he
has
been
the
hero
of
one
or
two
little
affairs
i
can
tell
you
about
them
if
you
bellamy
your
stories
are
either
true
or
untrue
if
true
i
should
take
no
notice
of
them
because
they
must
have
happened
before
he
loved
me
if
untrue
they
would
be
a
mere
waste
of
breath
so
i
think
that
we
may
dispense
with
the
would
influence
me
no
more
than
the
hum
of
next
lady
bellamy
smiled
again
are
a
curious
woman
she
said
supposing
that
there
were
to
be
a
repetition
of
these
little
stories
he
loved
you
what
would
you
say
then
angela
looked
troubled
and
thought
awhile
could
never
go
far
from
me
she
answered
do
you
mean
mean
that
i
hold
the
strings
of
his
heart
in
my
hands
and
i
have
only
to
lift
them
to
draw
him
back
to
no
other
woman
no
living
force
can
keep
him
from
me
if
i
choose
to
bid
him
that
to
be
so
how
about
the
you
spoke
of
just
now
could
you
bear
to
take
your
lover
back
from
the
hands
of
another
woman
would
entirely
depend
upon
the
circumstances
and
upon
what
was
just
to
the
other
would
not
then
throw
him
up
without
question
bellamy
i
may
be
very
ignorant
and
simple
but
i
am
neither
mad
nor
a
fool
what
do
you
suppose
that
my
life
would
be
worth
to
me
if
i
threw
arthur
up
if
i
remained
single
it
would
be
an
aching
void
as
it
is
now
and
if
i
married
any
other
man
whilst
he
still
lived
it
would
become
a
daily
and
shameful
humiliation
such
as
i
had
rather
die
than
lady
bellamy
glanced
up
from
under
her
eyes
a
thought
had
evidently
struck
her
but
she
did
not
express
it
i
am
to
tell
your
cousin
george
that
you
will
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
him
and
beg
him
to
cease
persecuting
me
it
is
quite
useless
if
there
were
no
arthur
and
no
other
man
in
the
world
i
would
not
marry
him
i
detest
can
not
tell
you
how
i
detest
is
amusing
to
hear
you
talk
so
and
to
think
that
you
will
certainly
be
george
caresfoot
within
nine
answered
angela
passionately
stamping
her
foot
upon
the
floor
makes
you
say
such
horrible
things
reflect
answered
lady
bellamy
with
an
ominous
smile
george
caresfoot
has
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
you
and
that
i
have
made
up
mine
to
help
him
to
do
so
and
that
your
will
strong
as
it
certainly
is
is
as
compared
with
our
united
wills
what
a
straw
is
to
a
gale
the
straw
can
not
travel
against
the
wind
it
go
with
it
and
you
marry
george
caresfoot
you
will
as
certainly
come
to
the
with
him
as
you
will
to
your
it
is
written
in
your
face
for
the
first
time
courage
really
gave
way
as
she
heard
these
dreadful
words
she
remembered
how
she
herself
had
called
lady
bellamy
an
embodiment
of
the
of
power
and
now
she
felt
that
the
comparison
was
just
the
woman
was
power
incarnate
and
her
words
which
from
anybody
else
she
would
have
laughed
at
sent
a
cold
chill
through
her
is
a
fine
creature
both
in
mind
and
body
reflected
lady
bellamy
as
she
stepped
into
her
carriage
though
i
try
to
hate
her
i
can
find
it
in
my
heart
to
be
sorry
for
her
indeed
i
am
not
sure
that
i
do
not
like
her
certainly
i
respect
her
but
she
has
come
in
my
path
and
must
be
own
safety
demands
it
at
least
she
is
worth
crushing
and
the
game
is
fair
for
perhaps
she
will
crush
me
i
should
not
be
surprised
there
is
a
judgment
in
those
grey
eyes
of
vivra
verra
home
chapter
xxxvii
appeal
for
protection
set
philip
thinking
as
the
reader
is
aware
his
sole
motive
in
consenting
to
become
as
it
were
a
sleeping
partner
in
the
shameful
plot
of
which
his
innocent
daughter
was
the
object
was
to
obtain
possession
of
his
lost
inheritance
and
it
now
occurred
to
him
that
even
should
that
plot
succeed
which
he
very
greatly
doubted
nothing
had
as
yet
been
settled
as
to
the
terms
upon
which
it
was
to
be
reconveyed
to
him
the
whole
affair
was
excessively
repugnant
to
him
indeed
he
regarded
the
prospect
of
its
success
with
little
less
than
terror
only
his
greed
his
fear
but
on
one
point
he
was
very
clear
it
should
not
succeed
except
upon
the
very
best
of
terms
for
himself
his
daughter
should
not
be
sacrificed
unless
the
price
paid
for
the
victim
was
positively
princely
such
guilt
was
not
to
be
incurred
for
a
bagatelle
if
george
married
angela
the
isleworth
estates
must
pass
back
into
his
hands
for
a
very
low
sum
indeed
but
would
his
cousin
be
willing
to
accept
such
a
sum
that
was
the
rub
and
that
too
was
what
must
be
made
clear
without
any
further
delay
he
had
no
wish
to
see
angela
put
to
needless
suffering
suffering
which
would
not
bring
an
equivalent
with
it
and
which
might
on
the
contrary
entail
consequences
upon
himself
that
he
shuddered
to
think
of
curiously
enough
however
he
had
of
late
been
signally
free
from
his
superstitious
fears
indeed
since
the
night
when
he
had
so
astonished
arthur
by
his
outbreak
about
the
shadows
on
the
wall
no
fit
had
come
to
trouble
him
and
he
was
beginning
to
look
upon
the
whole
thing
as
an
evil
dream
a
nightmare
that
he
had
at
last
lived
down
but
still
the
nightmare
might
return
and
he
was
not
going
to
run
the
risk
unless
he
was
very
well
paid
for
it
and
so
he
determined
to
offer
a
price
so
low
for
the
property
that
no
man
in
his
senses
would
accept
it
and
then
wrote
a
note
to
george
asking
him
to
come
over
on
the
following
evening
after
dinner
as
he
wished
to
speak
to
him
on
a
matter
of
business
he
said
to
himself
will
make
an
end
of
the
affair
and
i
will
get
young
heigham
back
and
they
can
be
married
george
can
never
take
what
i
mean
to
offer
if
he
should
the
egyptian
will
be
spoiled
indeed
and
the
game
will
be
worth
the
candle
not
that
i
have
any
responsibility
about
it
however
i
shall
put
no
pressure
on
angela
she
must
choose
for
and
philip
went
to
bed
quite
feeling
as
though
he
had
done
a
virtuous
action
george
came
punctually
enough
on
the
following
evening
which
was
that
of
the
day
of
lady
conversation
with
angela
a
conversation
which
had
so
upset
the
latter
that
she
had
already
gone
to
her
room
not
knowing
anything
of
her
proposed
visit
the
night
was
one
of
those
dreadfully
oppressive
ones
that
sometimes
visit
us
in
the
course
of
an
english
summer
the
day
had
been
hot
and
sultry
and
with
the
fall
of
the
evening
the
little
breeze
that
stirred
in
the
air
had
died
away
leaving
the
temperature
at
much
the
same
point
that
is
to
be
expected
in
a
tropical
valley
and
rendering
the
heat
of
the
house
almost
unbearable
do
you
do
george
said
philip
it
there
will
be
a
tempest
before
midnight
i
think
shall
we
go
and
walk
down
by
the
lake
it
will
be
cooler
there
and
we
shall
be
quite
undisturbed
walls
have
ears
sometimes
you
well
but
where
is
angela
met
her
on
the
stairs
just
now
and
she
said
that
she
was
going
to
a
headache
i
believe
shall
we
start
so
soon
as
they
were
well
away
from
the
house
philip
broke
the
ice
months
back
i
had
a
conversation
with
lady
bellamy
on
the
subject
of
a
proposal
that
you
made
to
me
through
her
for
hand
it
is
about
that
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
now
first
i
must
ask
if
you
still
wish
to
go
on
with
the
business
i
wish
it
more
than
as
i
intimated
to
lady
bellamy
i
do
not
at
all
approve
of
your
suit
angela
is
already
subject
to
my
consent
very
suitably
engaged
to
your
late
ward
a
young
fellow
whom
whatever
you
may
think
about
him
i
like
very
much
and
i
can
assure
you
that
it
will
require
the
very
strongest
inducements
to
make
me
even
allow
such
a
thing
in
any
case
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
influencing
angela
she
is
a
perfectly
free
means
i
suppose
that
you
intend
to
screw
down
the
price
wanting
to
marry
angela
went
on
philip
must
remember
that
you
fly
high
she
is
a
very
lovely
woman
and
what
is
more
will
some
day
or
other
be
exceedingly
well
off
whilst
must
excuse
me
for
being
candid
but
this
is
a
mere
matter
of
business
and
i
am
only
talking
of
you
in
the
light
of
a
possible
are
a
man
not
prepossessing
in
appearance
broken
in
health
and
however
well
you
may
have
kept
up
your
reputation
in
these
parts
as
you
and
i
well
know
without
a
single
shred
of
character
left
altogether
not
a
man
to
whom
a
father
would
marry
his
daughter
of
his
own
free
will
or
one
with
whom
a
young
girl
is
likely
to
find
draw
a
flattering
picture
of
me
i
must
at
all
only
a
true
if
i
am
all
you
say
how
is
it
that
you
are
prepared
to
allow
your
daughter
to
marry
me
at
all
will
tell
you
because
the
rights
of
property
should
take
precedence
of
the
interests
of
a
single
individual
because
my
father
and
you
between
you
cozened
me
out
of
my
lawful
own
and
this
is
the
only
way
that
i
see
of
coming
by
it
does
it
matter
in
any
case
after
your
death
the
land
will
come
back
to
angela
and
her
george
it
will
not
if
ever
the
isleworth
estates
come
into
my
hands
they
shall
not
pass
again
to
any
child
of
would
you
do
with
them
then
and
get
children
of
my
george
whistled
i
must
say
that
your
intentions
are
amiable
but
you
have
not
got
the
estates
yet
my
dear
and
never
shall
have
most
likely
but
let
us
come
to
the
point
although
i
do
not
approve
of
your
advances
i
am
willing
to
waive
my
objections
and
accept
you
as
a
if
you
can
win
consent
provided
that
before
the
marriage
you
consent
to
give
me
clear
transfer
at
a
price
of
all
the
isleworth
estates
with
the
exception
of
the
mansion
and
the
good
but
now
about
the
price
that
is
the
real
they
had
taken
a
path
that
ran
down
through
the
shrubberies
to
the
side
of
the
lake
and
then
turned
up
towards
staff
before
answering
remark
philip
proposed
that
they
should
sit
down
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
placed
himself
upon
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
that
lay
by
the
edge
just
outside
the
spread
of
the
branches
of
the
great
oak
and
commanding
a
view
of
the
area
beneath
them
moon
will
come
out
again
presently
he
said
when
george
had
followed
his
example
has
got
behind
that
ah
as
a
bright
flash
of
lightning
passed
from
heaven
to
earth
thought
that
we
should
get
a
storm
it
will
be
here
in
half
an
all
this
philip
said
to
gain
time
he
had
not
quite
made
up
his
mind
what
price
to
offer
mind
the
lightning
what
do
you
offer
for
the
property
inclusive
of
timber
and
with
all
as
it
stands
in
hundred
thousand
pounds
cash
said
philip
deliberately
george
sprang
from
his
seat
and
sat
down
again
before
he
answered
you
think
that
i
am
drunk
or
a
fool
that
you
come
to
me
with
such
a
ridiculous
offer
why
the
probate
valuation
was
two
hundred
thousand
and
that
was
very
offer
one
hundred
thousand
and
am
willing
to
settle
thirty
thousand
absolutely
on
the
girl
should
she
marry
you
and
twenty
thousand
more
on
my
death
that
is
my
it
or
leave
sense
man
your
terms
are
tell
you
that
preposterous
or
not
i
will
not
go
beyond
them
if
you
like
them
well
and
good
leave
them
alone
and
put
myself
in
communication
with
young
heigham
and
tell
him
that
he
can
come
and
marry
the
girl
as
soon
as
he
likes
for
my
part
i
am
very
glad
to
have
the
business
ask
me
to
sacrifice
half
my
property
groaned
george
property
you
mean
that
you
stole
but
i
ask
you
to
do
anything
one
way
or
the
other
i
am
to
understand
that
you
refuse
my
offer
me
a
minute
to
think
and
george
hid
his
face
in
his
hand
and
philip
looking
at
him
with
hatred
gleaming
in
his
dark
eyes
muttered
between
his
teeth
believe
that
my
turn
has
come
at
when
some
thirty
seconds
had
passed
in
silence
the
attention
of
the
pair
was
attracted
by
the
cracking
of
dead
leaves
that
sounded
quite
startling
in
the
intense
stillness
of
the
night
and
next
second
a
tall
figure
in
white
glided
up
to
the
edge
and
stood
still
within
half
a
dozen
paces
of
them
involuntarily
philip
gripped
his
arm
but
neither
of
them
moved
the
sky
had
rapidly
clouded
up
and
the
faint
light
that
struggled
from
the
moon
only
served
to
show
that
the
figure
appeared
to
be
lifting
its
arms
in
another
second
that
was
gone
too
and
the
place
was
totally
dark
till
the
moon
comes
out
and
we
shall
see
what
it
is
whispered
george
and
as
he
spoke
there
came
from
the
direction
of
the
figure
a
rustling
sound
as
of
falling
garments
can
it
be
whispered
philip
they
were
not
left
long
in
doubt
for
at
that
instant
a
vivid
flash
from
the
turned
the
darkness
into
the
most
brilliant
day
and
revealed
a
woman
standing
up
to
her
knees
in
the
water
with
her
arms
lifted
knotting
her
long
hair
it
was
angela
for
one
moment
the
fierce
light
shone
upon
the
stately
form
that
gleamed
whiter
than
as
snow
against
the
dense
background
of
the
brushwood
and
as
it
passed
they
heard
her
sink
into
the
water
softly
as
a
swan
and
strike
out
with
steady
strokes
towards
the
centre
of
the
lake
is
only
angela
said
philip
when
the
sound
of
the
strokes
grew
faint
what
a
state
she
gave
she
safe
asked
george
in
a
husky
voice
i
better
get
a
boat
needs
no
help
from
you
she
is
quite
capable
of
looking
after
herself
especially
in
the
water
i
can
tell
you
philip
answered
sharply
nothing
more
was
said
till
they
reached
the
house
when
on
entering
the
lighted
study
philip
noticed
that
his
face
was
flushed
and
his
hands
shaking
like
aspen
leaves
what
is
the
matter
with
you
man
he
asked
i
am
only
rather
cold
give
me
some
on
such
a
night
as
this
curious
said
philip
as
he
got
the
spirit
from
a
cupboard
george
drank
about
a
neat
and
seemed
to
recover
himself
accept
your
offer
for
the
land
philip
he
said
presently
his
cousin
looked
at
him
curiously
and
a
brilliant
idea
struck
him
agree
then
to
take
thousand
pounds
for
the
isleworth
estates
in
the
event
of
your
marrying
my
daughter
the
sale
to
be
completed
before
the
marriage
takes
place
thousand
no
a
hundred
said
a
hundred
thousand
just
must
have
misunderstood
me
or
i
must
have
made
a
mistake
what
i
meant
is
and
you
to
put
a
thousand
down
as
earnest
be
forfeited
whether
the
affair
comes
off
or
george
ground
his
teeth
and
clutched
at
his
red
hair
proceedings
that
his
cousin
watched
with
a
great
deal
of
quiet
enjoyment
when
at
length
he
spoke
it
was
in
a
low
hoarse
voice
quite
unlike
his
usual
hard
tones
you
he
said
have
me
at
your
mercy
take
the
land
for
the
money
if
you
like
though
it
will
nearly
ruin
me
that
woman
has
turned
my
head
i
marry
her
or
i
shall
go
good
that
is
your
affair
remember
that
i
have
no
responsibility
in
the
matter
and
that
i
am
not
going
to
put
any
pressure
on
angela
if
you
want
to
marry
her
you
must
win
her
within
the
next
eight
months
then
that
is
settled
i
suppose
that
you
will
pay
in
the
thousand
the
storm
is
coming
up
fast
so
i
keep
you
good
night
and
they
separated
george
to
drive
fever
in
his
heart
and
the
thunderstorm
of
which
he
heard
nothing
rattling
round
philip
to
make
his
way
to
bed
with
the
dream
of
his
life
advanced
a
step
nearer
realization
was
a
lucky
swim
of
he
thought
thousand
pounds
for
the
estate
he
is
right
he
must
be
going
mad
but
will
he
get
her
to
marry
him
i
wonder
if
he
does
i
shall
cry
quits
with
him
chapter
xxxviii
george
had
spoken
no
falsehood
when
he
said
that
he
felt
as
though
he
must
marry
angela
or
go
mad
indeed
it
is
a
striking
proof
of
how
necessary
he
thought
that
step
to
be
to
his
happiness
that
he
had
been
willing
to
consent
to
his
terms
about
the
sale
of
the
property
although
they
would
in
their
result
degrade
him
from
his
position
as
a
large
landed
proprietor
and
make
a
comparatively
poor
man
of
him
the
danger
or
suffering
that
could
induce
a
caresfoot
to
half
ruin
himself
with
his
eyes
open
had
need
to
be
of
an
extraordinarily
pressing
nature
empire
is
this
globe
and
all
mankind
the
most
refined
and
the
most
degraded
the
cleverest
and
the
most
stupid
are
all
liable
to
become
his
faithful
subjects
he
can
alike
command
the
devotion
of
an
archbishop
and
a
islander
of
the
most
immaculate
maiden
lady
whatever
her
age
and
of
the
savage
zulu
girl
from
the
pole
to
the
equator
and
from
the
equator
to
the
further
pole
there
is
no
monarch
like
love
where
he
sets
his
foot
the
rocks
bloom
with
flowers
or
the
garden
becomes
a
wilderness
according
to
his
will
and
pleasure
and
at
his
whisper
all
other
allegiances
melt
away
like
ropes
of
mud
he
is
the
real
arbiter
of
the
destinies
of
the
world
but
to
each
nature
of
all
the
millions
beneath
his
sway
love
comes
in
a
fitting
guise
to
some
as
an
angel
messenger
telling
of
sympathy
and
peace
and
a
strange
new
hope
to
others
draped
in
sad
robes
indeed
but
still
divine
thus
when
he
visits
such
a
one
as
george
caresfoot
it
is
as
a
potent
fiend
whose
mission
is
to
enter
through
lower
nature
to
torture
and
destroy
to
scorch
the
heart
with
fearful
heats
and
then
to
crush
it
and
leave
its
bosom
choked
with
bitter
dust
and
so
far
as
george
is
concerned
there
is
no
doubt
but
what
the
work
was
done
right
well
for
under
the
influence
of
what
is
with
doubtful
propriety
known
as
the
passion
that
estimable
character
was
rapidly
drifting
within
a
measurable
distance
of
a
lunatic
asylum
the
checks
and
repulses
that
he
had
met
with
instead
of
cooling
his
ardour
had
only
the
effect
of
inflaming
it
to
an
extraordinary
degree
scornful
dislike
as
water
thrown
upon
burning
oil
did
but
diffuse
the
flames
of
his
passion
throughout
the
whole
system
of
his
mind
till
he
grew
wild
with
its
heat
and
violence
her
glorious
beauty
daily
took
a
still
stronger
hold
upon
his
imagination
till
it
scorched
into
his
very
soul
for
whole
nights
he
could
not
sleep
for
whole
days
he
would
scarcely
eat
or
do
anything
but
walk
walk
walk
and
try
to
devise
means
to
win
her
to
his
side
the
irritation
of
the
mind
produced
its
natural
effects
upon
his
conduct
and
he
would
burst
into
fits
of
the
most
causeless
fury
in
one
of
these
he
dismissed
every
servant
in
the
house
and
so
evil
was
his
reputation
among
that
class
that
he
had
great
difficulty
in
obtaining
others
to
take
their
place
in
another
he
hurled
a
heavy
pot
containing
an
at
the
head
of
one
of
the
gardeners
and
had
to
compromise
an
action
for
assault
in
short
the
lunatic
asylum
loomed
very
near
indeed
for
a
week
or
so
after
the
memorable
night
of
his
interview
with
philip
an
interview
that
he
at
least
would
never
forget
george
was
quite
unable
try
as
he
would
to
get
a
single
word
with
angela
at
last
one
day
when
he
was
driving
by
a
road
past
the
fields
near
the
abbey
house
on
his
way
from
roxham
chance
gave
him
the
opportunity
that
he
had
for
so
long
sought
without
success
for
far
up
a
that
led
to
a
his
eye
caught
sight
of
the
flutter
of
a
grey
dress
vanishing
round
a
corner
something
in
the
make
of
which
suggested
to
him
that
angela
was
its
wearer
giving
the
reins
to
the
servant
and
bidding
him
drive
on
home
he
got
out
of
the
and
hurried
up
the
grassy
track
and
on
turning
the
corner
came
suddenly
upon
the
object
of
his
search
she
was
standing
on
the
bank
of
the
and
struggling
with
a
bough
of
honeysuckle
from
which
she
wished
to
pluck
its
last
remaining
autumn
bloom
so
engaged
was
she
that
she
did
not
hear
his
step
and
it
was
not
until
his
hard
voice
grated
on
her
ear
that
she
knew
that
she
was
trapped
at
last
you
have
given
me
a
pretty
hunt
the
violent
start
she
gave
effectually
carried
out
her
purpose
as
regards
the
honeysuckle
which
snapped
in
two
under
the
strain
of
her
backward
jerk
and
she
turned
round
upon
him
panting
with
fear
and
exertion
the
flowery
bough
grasped
within
her
hand
i
then
a
wild
creature
that
you
should
hunt
me
so
you
are
the
loveliest
and
the
wildest
of
creatures
and
now
i
have
caught
you
you
must
listen
to
will
not
listen
to
you
you
have
nothing
to
say
to
me
that
can
interest
me
i
will
not
listen
to
george
laughed
a
threatening
nervous
laugh
am
accustomed
to
have
my
own
way
angela
and
i
am
not
going
to
give
it
up
now
you
must
and
you
shall
listen
i
have
got
my
opportunity
at
last
and
i
mean
to
use
it
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
speak
so
roughly
but
you
have
only
yourself
to
thank
you
have
driven
me
to
his
determination
frightened
her
and
she
took
refuge
in
an
armour
of
calm
and
freezing
contempt
understand
you
she
said
the
contrary
you
understand
me
very
well
you
always
avoid
me
i
can
never
see
you
try
how
i
will
perhaps
he
went
on
still
talking
quite
quietly
you
knew
what
a
hell
there
is
in
my
heart
and
brain
you
would
not
treat
me
so
i
tell
you
that
i
am
in
torture
and
the
muscles
of
the
pallid
face
twitched
in
a
way
that
went
far
to
confirm
his
words
do
not
understand
your
meaning
unless
indeed
you
are
trying
to
frighten
and
insult
me
as
you
have
done
before
answered
angela
poor
girl
she
did
not
know
what
else
to
say
she
was
not
of
a
nervous
disposition
but
there
was
something
about
manner
that
alarmed
her
very
much
and
she
glanced
anxiously
around
to
see
if
any
one
was
within
call
but
the
place
was
lonely
as
the
grave
is
no
need
for
you
to
look
for
help
i
wish
neither
to
frighten
nor
insult
you
my
suit
is
an
honourable
one
enough
i
wish
you
to
promise
to
marry
me
that
is
all
you
must
and
shall
promise
it
i
will
take
no
refusal
you
were
made
for
me
and
i
for
you
it
is
quite
useless
for
you
to
resist
me
for
you
must
marry
me
at
last
i
love
you
and
by
that
right
you
belong
to
me
i
love
love
i
do
and
why
should
you
look
at
me
like
that
i
can
not
help
it
you
are
so
beautiful
if
you
knew
your
loveliness
you
would
understand
me
i
love
those
grey
eyes
of
yours
even
when
they
flash
and
burn
as
they
do
now
ah
they
shall
look
softly
at
me
yet
and
those
sweet
lips
that
curl
so
scornfully
shall
shape
themselves
to
kiss
me
listen
i
loved
you
when
i
first
saw
you
there
in
the
at
isleworth
i
loved
you
more
and
more
all
the
time
that
i
was
ill
and
now
i
love
you
to
madness
so
you
see
angela
you
marry
me
marry
you
say
you
for
sake
say
you
said
george
with
a
sudden
change
of
manner
from
the
confident
to
the
supplicatory
i
beg
you
not
to
on
my
knees
and
he
actually
flung
himself
down
on
the
grass
roadway
and
grovelled
before
her
in
an
abandonment
of
passion
hideous
to
behold
she
turned
very
pale
and
answered
him
in
a
cold
quiet
voice
every
syllable
of
which
fell
upon
him
like
the
stroke
of
a
knife
a
thing
would
be
quite
impossible
for
many
reasons
but
i
need
only
repeat
you
one
that
you
are
already
aware
of
i
am
engaged
to
that
is
nothing
i
know
that
but
you
will
not
throw
away
such
a
love
as
i
have
to
offer
for
the
wavering
affection
of
a
boy
we
can
soon
get
rid
of
him
write
and
tell
him
that
you
have
changed
your
mind
listen
angela
he
went
on
catching
her
by
the
skirt
of
her
dress
is
not
rich
he
has
only
got
enough
for
a
bare
living
i
have
five
times
the
money
and
you
shall
help
to
spend
it
marry
a
young
beggar
like
that
you
get
value
for
yourself
it
will
pay
you
ever
so
much
better
to
marry
george
was
convinced
from
his
experience
of
the
sex
that
every
woman
could
be
bought
if
only
you
bid
high
enough
but
as
the
sequel
showed
he
could
not
well
have
used
a
worse
argument
to
a
person
like
angela
or
one
more
likely
to
excite
the
indignation
that
fear
of
him
together
with
a
certain
respect
for
the
evident
genuineness
of
his
suffering
had
hitherto
kept
in
suppression
she
wrenched
her
dress
free
from
him
leaving
a
portion
of
its
fabric
in
his
hand
you
not
ashamed
she
said
her
voice
trembling
with
indignation
and
her
eyes
filled
with
angry
tears
you
not
ashamed
to
talk
to
me
like
this
my
own
cousin
and
yourself
old
enough
to
be
my
father
i
tell
you
that
my
love
is
already
given
which
would
have
been
a
sufficient
answer
to
any
and
you
reply
by
saying
that
you
are
richer
than
the
man
i
love
do
you
believe
that
a
woman
thinks
of
nothing
but
money
or
do
you
suppose
that
i
am
to
be
bought
like
a
beast
at
the
market
get
up
from
the
ground
for
since
your
brutality
forces
me
to
speak
so
plainly
in
my
own
defence
i
must
tell
you
once
and
for
all
that
you
will
get
nothing
by
kneeling
to
me
listen
i
would
rather
die
than
be
your
wife
rather
than
always
see
your
face
about
me
i
would
pass
my
life
in
prison
i
had
sooner
be
touched
by
a
snake
than
by
you
you
are
quite
hateful
to
me
now
you
have
your
answer
and
i
beg
that
you
will
get
up
and
let
me
pass
drawn
up
the
full
height
of
her
majestic
stature
her
face
flushed
with
emotion
and
her
clear
eyes
flashing
scornful
fire
whilst
in
her
hand
she
still
held
the
bough
of
sweet
honeysuckle
angela
formed
a
strange
contrast
to
the
miserable
man
crouched
at
her
feet
swaying
himself
to
and
fro
and
moaning
his
hat
off
and
his
face
hidden
in
his
trembling
hands
as
he
would
not
or
could
not
move
she
left
him
there
and
slipping
through
a
neighbouring
gap
vanished
from
sight
when
she
was
fairly
gone
he
stirred
and
having
risen
and
recovered
his
hat
which
had
fallen
off
in
his
excitement
his
first
action
was
to
shake
his
fist
in
the
direction
in
which
she
had
vanished
his
next
to
frantically
kiss
the
fragment
of
her
dress
that
he
still
held
in
his
hand
marry
me
yet
my
fine
lady
he
hissed
between
his
teeth
if
i
do
not
repay
your
gentle
words
with
interest
my
name
is
not
george
caresfoot
and
then
staggering
like
a
drunken
man
he
made
his
way
home
arthur
thought
angela
as
she
crept
quite
broken
in
spirit
to
the
solitude
of
her
room
i
only
knew
where
you
were
i
think
that
i
would
follow
you
promise
or
no
promise
there
is
no
one
to
help
me
no
one
they
are
all
in
league
against
my
own
chapter
xxxix
notwithstanding
his
brave
threats
made
behind
back
about
forcing
her
to
marry
him
in
the
teeth
of
any
opposition
that
she
could
offer
george
reached
home
that
night
very
much
disheartened
about
the
whole
business
how
was
he
to
bow
the
neck
of
this
proud
woman
to
his
yoke
and
break
the
strong
cord
of
her
allegiance
to
her
absent
lover
with
many
girls
it
might
have
been
possible
to
find
a
way
but
angela
was
not
an
ordinary
girl
he
had
tried
and
lady
bellamy
had
tried
and
they
had
both
failed
and
as
for
philip
he
would
take
no
active
part
in
the
matter
what
more
could
be
done
only
one
thing
that
he
could
think
of
he
could
force
lady
bellamy
to
search
her
finer
brains
for
a
fresh
expedient
acting
upon
this
idea
he
at
once
despatched
a
note
to
her
requesting
her
to
come
and
see
him
at
isleworth
on
the
following
morning
that
night
passed
very
ill
for
the
george
vigorous
and
imaginative
expression
of
her
entire
loathing
of
him
had
pierced
even
the
thick
hide
of
his
and
left
him
sore
as
a
whipped
hound
altogether
too
sore
to
sleep
when
lady
bellamy
arrived
on
the
following
morning
she
found
him
marching
up
and
down
the
in
the
worst
of
his
bad
tempers
and
that
was
a
very
shocking
temper
indeed
his
light
blue
eyes
were
angry
and
bloodshot
his
general
appearance
slovenly
to
the
last
degree
and
a
red
spot
burned
upon
each
sallow
cheek
george
what
is
the
matter
you
look
quite
so
happy
as
a
lover
he
grunted
by
way
of
answer
the
lady
been
unkind
failed
to
appreciate
your
advances
eh
look
here
anne
he
answered
savagely
i
have
to
put
up
with
things
from
that
confounded
girl
i
am
not
going
to
stand
your
jeers
so
stop
them
once
and
for
is
very
evident
that
she
has
been
unkind
supposing
that
instead
of
abusing
me
you
tell
me
the
details
no
doubt
they
are
interesting
and
she
settled
herself
in
a
low
chair
and
glanced
at
him
keenly
from
under
her
heavy
eyelids
thus
admonished
george
proceeded
to
giver
her
such
a
version
of
his
melancholy
tale
as
best
suited
him
needless
to
say
not
a
full
one
but
his
imagination
easily
supplied
the
gaps
and
as
he
proceeded
a
slow
smile
crept
over
her
face
as
she
conjured
up
the
suppressed
details
of
the
scene
in
the
lane
you
what
are
you
laughing
at
you
came
here
to
listen
not
laugh
broke
out
george
furiously
when
he
saw
it
she
made
no
answer
and
he
continued
his
thrilling
tale
without
comment
on
her
part
he
said
when
it
was
finished
is
to
be
done
is
nothing
to
be
done
you
have
failed
to
win
her
affections
and
there
is
an
end
of
the
you
mean
i
must
give
it
up
and
a
very
good
thing
too
for
the
ridiculous
arrangement
that
you
have
entered
into
with
philip
would
have
you
and
you
would
be
tired
of
the
girl
in
a
look
you
here
anne
said
george
in
a
sort
of
hiss
and
standing
over
her
in
a
threatening
attitude
have
suspected
for
some
time
that
you
were
playing
me
false
in
this
business
and
now
i
am
sure
of
it
you
have
put
the
girl
up
to
treating
me
like
this
you
treacherous
snake
you
have
struck
me
from
behind
you
red
indian
in
petticoats
but
look
here
i
will
be
square
with
you
you
shall
not
have
all
the
laugh
on
your
you
must
be
shall
see
whether
i
am
mad
or
not
did
you
see
what
the
brigands
did
to
a
fellow
they
caught
in
greece
the
other
day
for
whom
they
wanted
ransom
first
they
sent
his
ear
to
his
friends
then
his
nose
then
his
foot
and
last
of
all
his
by
post
mark
you
well
dear
anne
that
is
just
how
i
am
going
to
pay
you
out
you
shall
have
a
week
to
find
a
fresh
plan
to
trap
the
bird
you
have
frightened
and
if
you
find
none
first
i
shall
post
one
of
those
interesting
letters
that
i
have
yonder
to
your
you
a
very
compromising
one
but
one
that
will
pique
his
curiosity
and
set
him
making
inquiries
then
i
shall
wait
another
lady
bellamy
could
bear
it
no
longer
she
sprang
up
from
her
chair
pale
with
anger
fiend
in
human
form
what
is
it
i
wonder
that
has
kept
me
so
long
from
destroying
you
and
myself
too
oh
you
need
not
laugh
i
have
the
means
to
do
it
if
i
choose
i
have
had
them
for
twenty
george
laughed
again
hoarsely
i
declare
but
i
think
you
will
come
to
that
you
would
be
afraid
and
if
you
do
i
much
am
pretty
reckless
i
can
tell
your
threats
she
went
on
without
heeding
him
care
nothing
for
as
i
tell
you
i
have
their
antidote
at
hand
you
have
known
me
for
many
years
tell
me
did
you
ever
see
my
nerve
desert
me
do
you
suppose
that
i
am
a
woman
who
would
bear
failure
when
i
could
choose
death
no
george
i
had
rather
pass
into
eternity
on
the
crest
of
the
wave
of
my
success
such
as
it
has
been
and
let
it
break
and
grind
me
to
powder
there
or
else
bear
me
to
greater
heights
all
that
should
have
been
a
better
part
in
the
world
you
have
destroyed
in
me
i
do
not
say
that
it
was
altogether
your
fault
for
an
evil
destiny
bound
me
to
you
and
it
must
seem
odd
to
you
when
i
say
that
knowing
you
for
what
you
are
i
still
love
you
and
to
fill
up
this
void
to
trample
down
those
surging
memories
i
have
made
myself
a
slave
to
my
ambition
and
the
acquisition
of
another
power
that
you
can
not
understand
the
man
you
married
me
to
is
rich
and
a
knight
i
made
him
so
if
i
live
another
twenty
years
his
wealth
shall
be
colossal
and
his
influence
unbounded
and
i
will
be
one
of
the
most
powerful
women
in
the
kingdom
why
do
you
suppose
that
i
so
fear
your
treachery
do
you
think
that
i
should
mind
its
being
known
that
i
had
thrown
aside
that
poor
green
garment
that
marks
a
coward
or
a
fool
for
mark
you
all
women
or
nearly
all
would
be
vicious
if
they
dared
fear
and
poverty
of
spirit
restrain
them
not
virtue
why
it
is
by
their
vices
properly
managed
that
women
have
always
risen
and
always
will
rise
to
be
really
great
i
think
that
a
woman
must
be
vicious
with
discrimination
and
i
respect
vice
accordingly
no
it
is
not
that
i
fear
i
am
afraid
because
i
have
a
husband
whose
bitter
resentment
is
justly
piling
up
against
me
from
year
to
year
who
only
lies
in
wait
for
an
opportunity
to
destroy
me
nor
is
he
my
only
enemy
in
his
skilful
hands
the
letters
you
possess
can
as
society
is
in
this
country
be
used
so
as
to
make
me
powerless
yes
george
all
the
good
in
me
is
dead
the
mad
love
i
have
given
you
is
hourly
outraged
and
yet
i
can
not
shake
it
off
alone
my
strength
fails
me
and
i
am
weak
as
a
child
only
the
power
to
exercise
my
will
my
sense
of
command
over
the
dullards
round
me
and
a
yet
keener
pleasure
you
do
not
know
of
are
left
to
me
if
these
are
taken
away
what
will
my
life
be
a
void
a
waste
a
howling
wilderness
a
place
where
i
will
not
stay
i
had
rather
tempt
the
unknown
even
in
hell
there
must
be
scope
for
abilities
such
as
mine
she
paused
awhile
as
if
for
an
answer
and
then
went
as
for
you
poor
creature
that
you
are
words
can
not
tell
how
i
despise
you
you
discard
me
and
my
devotion
to
follow
a
nature
in
its
way
it
is
true
greater
even
than
my
own
representing
the
principle
of
good
as
i
represent
the
principle
of
evil
but
one
to
which
yours
is
utterly
abhorrent
can
you
mix
light
with
darkness
or
filthy
oil
with
water
as
well
hope
to
merge
your
life
black
as
it
is
with
every
wickedness
with
that
of
the
splendid
creature
you
would
defile
do
you
suppose
that
a
woman
such
as
she
will
ever
be
really
faithless
to
her
love
even
though
you
trap
her
into
marriage
fool
her
heart
is
as
far
above
you
as
the
stars
and
without
a
heart
a
woman
is
a
husk
that
none
but
such
miserables
as
yourself
would
own
but
go
yourself
against
a
white
purity
that
will
in
the
end
blind
and
destroy
you
dree
your
own
doom
i
will
find
you
expedients
it
is
my
business
to
obey
you
you
shall
marry
her
if
you
will
and
taste
of
the
judgment
that
will
follow
be
still
i
will
bear
no
more
of
your
insolence
and
she
swept
out
of
the
room
leaving
george
looking
somewhat
scared
when
lady
bellamy
reached
rewtham
house
she
went
straight
to
her
study
he
received
her
with
much
politeness
and
asked
her
to
sit
down
have
come
to
consult
you
on
a
matter
of
some
importance
she
said
is
indeed
an
unusual
occurrence
answered
sir
john
rubbing
his
dry
hands
and
smiling
is
not
my
own
affair
listen
and
she
gave
him
a
full
accurate
and
clear
account
of
all
that
had
taken
place
with
reference
to
determination
to
marry
angela
not
omitting
the
most
trivial
detail
sir
john
expressed
no
surprise
he
was
a
very
old
bird
was
sir
john
one
for
whom
every
net
was
spread
in
vain
whether
in
or
out
of
his
sight
nothing
in
this
world
provided
that
it
did
not
affect
his
own
comfort
or
safety
could
affect
his
bland
and
appreciative
smile
he
was
never
surprised
once
or
twice
he
put
a
shrewd
question
to
elucidate
some
point
in
the
narrative
and
that
was
all
when
his
wife
was
finished
he
said
anne
you
have
told
a
very
interesting
and
amusing
little
history
doubly
so
if
you
will
permit
me
to
say
it
seeing
that
it
is
told
of
george
caresfoot
by
lady
bellamy
but
it
seems
that
your
joint
efforts
have
failed
what
is
it
that
you
wish
me
to
do
wish
to
ask
you
if
you
can
suggest
any
plan
that
will
not
fail
you
are
very
cunning
in
your
way
and
your
advice
may
be
me
see
young
heigham
is
in
madeira
is
he
not
am
sure
i
do
not
i
do
and
he
extracted
a
from
a
drawer
me
see
i
think
i
have
an
entry
somewhere
here
ah
here
we
are
heigham
passenger
per
to
madeira
june
copied
from
daily
his
second
name
is
preston
is
it
not
lucky
i
kept
that
now
the
thing
will
be
to
communicate
with
madeira
and
see
if
he
is
still
there
i
can
easily
do
that
i
know
a
man
you
formed
any
plan
then
answered
sir
john
with
great
deliberation
think
i
see
my
way
but
i
must
have
time
to
think
of
it
i
will
speak
to
you
about
it
when
lady
bellamy
had
gone
the
little
man
rose
peeped
round
to
see
that
nobody
was
within
hearing
and
then
rubbing
his
dry
hands
with
infinite
zest
said
aloud
in
a
voice
that
was
quite
solemn
in
the
intensity
of
its
satisfaction
lord
hath
delivered
mine
enemies
into
mine
chapter
xl
two
days
after
sir
john
had
been
taken
into
confidence
philip
received
a
visit
from
lady
bellamy
that
caused
him
a
good
deal
of
discomfort
after
talking
to
him
on
general
subjects
for
awhile
she
rose
to
go
the
way
caresfoot
she
said
really
had
almost
forgotten
the
object
of
my
visit
you
may
remember
a
conversation
we
had
together
some
time
ago
when
i
was
the
means
of
paying
a
debt
owing
to
you
philip
nodded
you
will
not
have
forgotten
that
one
of
the
articles
of
our
little
verbal
convention
was
that
if
it
should
be
considered
to
the
interest
of
all
the
parties
concerned
your
old
nurse
was
not
to
remain
in
your
house
do
you
know
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
it
must
be
a
bad
thing
for
angela
to
have
so
much
of
the
society
of
an
and
not
very
refined
person
like
pigott
i
really
advise
you
to
get
rid
of
has
been
with
me
for
twenty
years
and
my
daughter
is
devoted
to
her
i
turn
her
is
always
painful
to
dismiss
an
old
as
bad
as
discarding
an
old
dress
but
when
a
dress
is
worn
out
it
must
be
thrown
away
surely
the
same
applies
to
see
how
i
am
to
send
her
can
quite
understand
your
feelings
but
then
you
see
an
agreement
implies
obligations
on
both
sides
it
especially
an
agreement
value
received
as
the
lawyers
philip
winced
perceptibly
wish
i
had
never
had
anything
to
do
with
your
if
you
think
it
over
i
think
that
you
will
say
so
well
that
is
settled
i
suppose
she
will
go
pretty
soon
i
am
glad
to
see
you
looking
so
different
from
your
cousin
i
assure
you
i
think
much
of
his
state
of
health
remember
me
to
angela
by
the
way
i
know
if
you
have
heard
that
george
has
met
with
a
repulse
in
that
direction
he
does
not
intend
to
press
matters
any
more
at
present
but
of
course
the
agreement
holds
all
the
same
nobody
knows
what
the
morrow
may
bring
you
and
my
amiable
cousin
are
concerned
i
shall
be
much
surprised
if
it
does
not
bring
forth
villany
thought
philip
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
front
door
close
suppose
that
it
must
be
done
about
pigott
curse
that
woman
with
her
sorceress
face
i
wish
i
had
never
put
myself
into
her
power
the
iron
hand
can
be
felt
pretty
plainly
through
her
velvet
life
is
never
altogether
clouded
over
and
that
morning
horizon
had
been
brightened
by
two
big
rays
of
sunshine
that
came
to
shed
their
cheering
light
on
the
grey
monotony
of
her
surroundings
for
of
late
notwithstanding
its
occasional
spasms
of
fierce
excitement
her
life
had
been
as
monotonous
as
it
was
miserable
always
the
same
anxious
grief
the
same
fears
the
same
longing
pressing
hourly
round
her
like
phantoms
in
the
not
like
phantoms
like
real
living
things
peeping
at
her
from
the
dark
sometimes
indeed
the
presentiments
and
intangible
terrors
that
were
gradually
strengthening
their
hold
upon
her
would
get
beyond
her
control
and
arouse
in
her
a
restless
desire
for
action
it
did
not
matter
would
take
her
away
out
of
these
dull
hours
of
unwholesome
mental
growth
it
was
this
longing
to
be
doing
something
that
drove
her
fevered
physically
with
the
stifling
air
of
the
summer
night
and
mentally
by
thoughts
of
her
absent
lover
and
recollections
of
lady
ominous
words
down
to
the
borders
of
the
lake
on
the
evening
of
visit
to
her
father
and
once
there
prompted
her
to
try
to
forget
her
troubles
for
awhile
in
the
exercise
of
an
art
of
which
she
had
from
childhood
been
a
mistress
the
same
feeling
it
was
too
that
led
her
to
spend
long
hours
of
the
day
and
even
of
the
night
when
by
rights
she
should
have
been
asleep
immersed
in
endless
mathematical
studies
and
in
solving
or
attempting
to
solve
almost
impossible
problems
she
found
that
the
strenuous
effort
of
the
brain
acted
as
a
to
the
fretting
of
her
troubles
and
though
it
may
seem
an
odd
thing
to
say
mathematics
alone
owing
to
the
intense
application
they
required
exercised
a
soothing
effect
upon
her
but
as
one
can
not
constantly
sleep
induced
by
chloral
without
paying
for
it
in
some
shape
or
form
relief
from
her
cares
was
obtained
at
no
small
cost
to
her
health
when
the
same
brain
however
well
developed
it
may
be
has
both
to
study
hard
and
suffer
much
there
must
be
a
waste
of
tissue
somewhere
in
case
the
outward
and
visible
result
of
this
state
of
things
was
to
make
her
grow
thinner
and
the
alternate
mental
effect
to
increasingly
rarefy
an
intellect
already
too
ethereal
for
this
world
and
to
plunge
its
owner
into
fits
of
depression
which
were
rendered
dreadful
by
sudden
forebodings
of
evil
that
would
leap
to
life
in
the
recesses
of
her
mind
and
for
a
moment
cast
a
lurid
glare
upon
its
gloom
such
as
at
night
the
lightning
gives
to
the
blackness
which
surrounds
it
it
was
in
one
of
the
worst
of
these
fits
her
as
she
would
call
them
to
pigott
that
good
news
found
her
as
she
was
dressing
pigott
brought
her
a
letter
which
recognizing
lady
bold
handwriting
she
opened
in
fear
and
trembling
it
contained
a
short
note
and
another
letter
the
note
ran
as
follows
angela
enclose
you
a
letter
from
your
cousin
george
which
contains
what
i
suppose
you
will
consider
good
news
your
own
i
beg
you
not
to
send
it
back
unopened
as
you
did
the
last
for
a
moment
angela
was
tempted
to
mistrust
this
enclosure
and
almost
come
to
the
determination
to
throw
it
into
the
fire
feeling
sure
that
a
serpent
lurked
in
the
grass
and
that
it
was
a
cunningly
disguised
but
curiosity
overcame
her
and
she
opened
it
as
gingerly
as
though
it
were
infected
unfolding
the
sheet
with
the
handle
of
her
its
contents
were
destined
to
give
her
a
surprise
they
ran
thus
hall
september
dear
cousin
what
passed
between
us
a
few
days
ago
you
will
perhaps
be
surprised
at
hearing
from
me
but
if
you
have
the
patience
to
read
this
short
letter
its
contents
will
not
i
fear
be
altogether
displeasing
to
you
they
are
very
simple
i
write
to
say
that
i
accept
your
verdict
and
that
you
need
fear
no
further
advances
from
me
whether
i
quite
deserved
all
the
bitter
words
you
poured
out
upon
me
i
leave
you
to
judge
at
leisure
seeing
that
my
only
crime
was
that
i
loved
you
to
most
women
that
offence
would
not
have
seemed
so
unpardonable
but
that
is
as
it
may
be
after
what
you
said
there
is
only
one
course
left
for
a
man
who
has
any
that
is
to
withdraw
so
let
the
past
be
dead
between
us
i
shall
never
allude
to
it
again
wishing
you
happiness
in
the
path
of
life
which
you
have
chosen
remain
affectionate
cousin
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
any
one
to
have
received
a
more
perfectly
satisfactory
letter
than
this
was
to
angela
she
called
out
feeling
the
absolute
necessity
of
a
confidant
in
her
joy
and
forgetting
that
that
worthy
soul
had
nothing
but
the
most
general
knowledge
of
advances
has
given
me
up
just
think
he
is
going
to
let
me
alone
i
declare
that
i
feel
quite
fond
of
who
might
you
be
talking
of
miss
my
cousin
george
of
course
he
is
going
to
let
me
alone
i
tell
seeing
how
as
he
fit
to
touch
you
with
a
pair
of
tongs
is
about
the
least
as
he
can
do
miss
and
as
for
letting
you
alone
i
know
as
he
ever
proposed
doing
anything
else
but
that
reminds
me
miss
though
i
am
sure
i
know
why
it
should
how
as
hawkins
as
was
put
in
to
look
after
the
vicarage
while
the
reverend
fraser
was
away
told
me
last
night
how
as
she
had
got
a
telegraft
the
sight
of
which
she
said
knocked
her
all
faint
like
till
she
turned
just
as
yellow
as
the
cover
to
say
nothing
of
porterage
the
which
however
she
intends
to
recover
from
the
where
was
i
am
sure
i
know
pigott
but
i
suppose
you
were
going
to
tell
me
what
was
in
the
miss
right
but
my
head
does
seem
to
wool
up
somehow
so
at
times
that
i
fare
to
lose
my
pigott
what
was
in
the
telegram
miss
how
you
do
hurry
one
begging
your
pardon
only
that
the
reverend
but
what
hawkins
do
say
that
it
be
true
because
the
words
in
his
writing
nor
nothing
like
as
she
has
good
reason
to
know
seeing
but
what
about
fraser
pigott
he
well
telegraft
say
as
i
remembers
miss
bless
me
i
forget
if
it
was
or
pigott
groaned
angela
tell
me
what
was
in
the
miss
surely
i
told
you
that
the
thing
said
though
i
fancy
likely
to
be
in
almost
shouted
angela
that
the
reverend
fraser
would
be
home
by
the
midday
train
and
would
like
a
beefsteak
for
lunch
not
mentioning
however
anything
about
the
onions
which
is
very
puzzling
to
i
am
glad
why
could
you
not
tell
me
before
cousin
george
disposed
of
and
fraser
coming
back
why
things
are
looking
quite
bright
again
at
least
they
would
be
if
only
arthur
were
here
and
her
rejoicing
ended
in
a
sigh
as
soon
as
she
thought
that
he
would
have
finished
his
beefsteak
with
or
without
the
onions
angela
walked
down
to
the
vicarage
and
broke
in
upon
fraser
with
something
of
her
old
gladsome
warmth
running
up
to
him
without
waiting
to
be
announced
she
seized
him
by
both
hands
so
you
are
back
at
last
what
a
long
time
you
have
been
away
oh
i
am
so
glad
to
see
fraser
who
it
struck
her
looked
older
since
his
absence
turned
first
a
little
red
and
then
a
little
pale
and
said
angela
here
i
am
back
again
in
the
old
shop
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
come
so
soon
to
see
me
now
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
about
yourself
whilst
i
go
on
with
my
unpacking
but
bless
me
my
dear
what
is
the
matter
with
you
you
look
thin
and
as
though
you
were
not
happy
has
your
smile
gone
to
angela
mind
me
you
must
tell
me
all
about
yourself
first
where
have
you
been
and
what
have
you
been
doing
all
these
long
months
i
have
been
enjoying
myself
over
half
the
civilized
globe
he
answered
with
a
somewhat
forced
laugh
italy
and
spain
have
all
been
benefited
by
my
presence
but
i
got
tired
of
it
so
here
i
am
back
in
my
proper
sphere
and
delighted
to
again
behold
these
dear
familiar
faces
and
he
pointed
to
his
ample
collection
of
classics
let
me
hear
about
yourself
angela
i
am
tired
of
no
i
can
assure
mine
is
a
long
story
you
will
scarcely
find
patience
to
listen
to
i
thought
that
there
was
a
story
from
your
face
then
i
think
that
i
can
guess
what
it
is
about
young
stories
generally
turn
upon
the
same
pivot
and
he
laughed
a
little
softly
and
sat
down
in
a
corner
well
out
of
the
light
my
dear
i
am
ready
to
give
you
my
best
angela
blushed
very
deeply
and
looking
studiously
out
of
the
window
began
with
many
hesitations
to
tell
her
story
fraser
you
must
understand
first
of
mean
you
know
that
i
must
tell
you
desperately
i
am
there
was
a
something
so
sharp
and
sudden
about
this
exclamation
that
angela
turned
round
quickly
the
matter
have
you
hurt
yourself
but
go
on
it
was
an
awkward
story
to
tell
especially
the
george
complication
part
of
it
and
to
any
one
else
she
felt
that
she
would
have
found
it
almost
impossible
to
tell
it
but
in
fraser
she
was
she
knew
sure
of
a
sympathetic
listener
had
she
known
too
that
the
mere
mention
of
her
name
was
a
stab
to
her
heart
and
that
every
expression
of
her
own
deep
and
enduring
love
and
each
tone
of
endearment
were
new
and
ingenious
tortures
she
might
well
have
been
confused
for
so
it
was
although
he
was
fifty
years
of
age
fraser
had
not
educated
angela
with
impunity
he
had
paid
the
penalty
that
must
have
resulted
to
any
man
not
absolutely
a
fossil
who
had
been
brought
into
close
contact
with
such
a
woman
as
angela
her
loveliness
appealed
to
his
sense
of
beauty
her
goodness
to
his
heart
and
her
learning
to
his
intellectual
sympathies
what
wonder
that
he
learnt
by
imperceptible
degrees
to
love
her
the
wonder
would
have
been
if
he
had
not
the
reader
need
not
fear
however
he
shall
not
be
troubled
with
any
long
account
of
misfortune
for
it
never
came
to
light
or
obtruded
itself
upon
the
world
or
even
upon
its
object
his
was
one
of
those
earnest
secret
and
passions
of
which
if
we
only
knew
it
there
exist
a
good
many
round
about
us
passions
which
to
all
appearance
tend
to
nothing
and
are
entirely
without
object
unless
it
to
be
make
the
individuals
on
whom
they
are
inflicted
a
little
less
happy
or
a
little
more
miserable
as
the
case
may
be
than
he
or
she
would
otherwise
have
been
it
was
to
strive
to
conquer
this
passion
which
in
his
heart
he
called
dishonourable
that
fraser
had
gone
abroad
right
away
from
angela
where
he
had
wrestled
with
it
and
prayed
against
it
and
at
last
as
he
thought
subdued
it
but
now
on
his
first
sight
of
her
it
rose
again
in
all
its
former
strength
and
rushed
through
his
being
like
a
storm
and
he
realized
that
such
love
is
of
those
things
that
can
not
die
and
perhaps
it
is
a
question
if
he
really
wished
to
lose
it
it
was
a
poor
thing
indeed
a
very
poor
thing
but
his
own
there
is
something
so
divine
about
all
true
love
that
there
lurks
a
conviction
at
the
bottom
of
the
hearts
of
most
of
us
that
it
is
better
to
love
however
much
we
suffer
than
not
to
love
at
all
perhaps
after
all
those
really
to
be
pitied
are
the
people
who
are
not
capable
of
any
such
sensation
but
what
fraser
suffered
listening
that
autumn
afternoon
to
tale
of
love
and
of
her
own
deep
return
of
that
love
no
man
but
himself
ever
knew
yet
still
he
heard
and
was
not
shaken
in
his
and
comforted
and
consoled
her
giving
her
the
best
advice
in
his
power
like
the
noble
christian
gentleman
that
he
was
showing
her
too
that
there
was
little
need
of
anxiety
and
every
ground
for
hope
that
things
would
come
to
a
happy
and
successful
issue
the
abnegation
of
self
is
not
yet
dead
in
the
world
at
last
angela
came
to
the
letter
that
she
had
that
very
morning
received
from
george
fraser
read
it
carefully
any
rate
he
said
is
behaving
like
a
gentleman
now
on
the
whole
that
is
a
nice
letter
you
will
be
troubled
with
him
no
answered
angela
and
then
flushing
up
at
the
memory
of
arguments
in
the
lane
it
is
certainly
time
that
he
did
for
he
had
no
business
oh
he
had
no
business
to
speak
to
me
as
he
spoke
and
he
a
man
old
enough
to
be
my
pale
cheeks
coloured
a
little
be
hard
upon
him
because
he
is
old
by
the
way
he
is
not
he
is
nearly
ten
years
my
i
fear
that
old
men
are
just
as
liable
to
be
made
fools
of
by
a
pretty
face
as
young
from
that
moment
not
knowing
the
real
character
fraser
secretly
entertained
a
certain
sympathy
for
sufferings
arising
no
doubt
from
a
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
understand
a
man
going
very
far
indeed
when
his
object
was
to
win
angela
not
that
he
would
have
done
it
himself
but
he
knew
the
temptation
and
what
it
cost
to
struggle
against
it
it
was
nearly
dark
when
at
length
angela
rising
to
go
warmly
pressed
his
hand
and
thanked
him
in
her
own
sweet
way
for
his
goodness
and
kind
counsel
and
then
declining
his
offer
of
escort
and
saying
that
she
would
come
and
see
him
again
on
the
morrow
she
departed
on
her
homeward
path
the
first
thing
that
met
her
gaze
on
the
at
the
abbey
house
was
a
note
addressed
to
herself
in
a
handwriting
that
she
had
seen
in
many
washing
bills
but
never
before
on
an
envelope
she
opened
it
in
vague
alarm
it
ran
as
follows
father
has
just
dismissed
me
saying
that
he
is
too
pore
to
keep
me
any
longer
which
is
a
matter
as
i
holds
my
own
opinion
on
and
that
i
am
too
uneddicated
to
be
in
yore
company
which
is
a
perfect
truth
but
miss
not
feeling
any
how
ekal
to
bid
you
in
person
after
bringing
you
up
by
hand
and
doing
for
you
these
many
years
i
takes
the
liberty
to
write
to
you
miss
to
say
and
god
bless
you
my
beautiful
angel
and
i
shall
be
to
be
found
down
at
the
old
housen
at
the
end
of
the
drift
as
my
pore
husband
left
me
which
is
fortinately
just
empty
and
you
will
come
and
see
me
at
times
miss
obedient
servant
opens
this
again
to
say
how
as
i
have
tied
up
your
things
a
bit
afore
i
left
leaving
mine
till
when
if
living
i
shall
send
for
them
if
you
please
miss
you
will
find
yore
clean
in
the
left
hand
drawyer
and
sorry
am
i
that
i
be
there
to
lay
it
out
for
you
i
shall
take
the
liberty
to
send
up
for
your
washing
as
it
be
trusted
to
any
angela
read
the
letter
through
and
then
sank
back
upon
a
chair
and
burst
into
a
storm
of
tears
partially
recovering
herself
however
she
rose
and
entered
her
study
this
true
she
asked
still
sobbing
what
true
asked
philip
indifferently
and
affecting
not
to
see
her
distress
you
have
sent
pigott
away
yes
you
see
you
mean
that
she
is
really
to
stop
away
course
i
do
i
really
must
be
allowed
me
father
but
i
do
not
want
to
listen
to
your
reasons
and
her
eyes
were
quite
dry
now
woman
nursed
my
dying
mother
and
played
a
part
to
me
she
is
as
you
know
my
only
woman
friend
and
yet
you
throw
her
away
like
a
shoe
no
doubt
you
have
your
reasons
and
i
hope
that
they
are
satisfactory
to
you
but
i
tell
you
reasons
or
no
reasons
you
have
acted
in
a
way
that
is
cowardly
and
cruel
and
casting
one
indignant
glance
at
him
she
left
the
room
philip
quailed
before
his
anger
goodness
gone
and
that
job
is
done
with
i
am
downright
afraid
of
her
and
the
worst
of
it
is
she
speaks
the
truth
said
philip
to
himself
as
the
door
closed
ten
days
after
this
incident
angela
heard
casually
from
fraser
that
sir
john
and
lady
bellamy
were
going
on
a
short
trip
abroad
for
the
benefit
of
the
health
if
she
thought
about
the
matter
at
all
it
was
to
feel
rather
glad
angela
did
not
like
lady
bellamy
indeed
she
feared
her
of
george
she
neither
heard
nor
saw
anything
he
had
also
gone
away
chapter
xli
meanwhile
at
madeira
matters
were
going
on
much
as
we
left
them
there
had
indeed
been
little
appreciable
change
in
the
situation
for
his
part
our
friend
arthur
continued
to
dance
or
rather
stroll
along
the
edge
of
his
flowery
precipice
and
found
the
view
pleasant
and
the
air
bracing
and
no
doubt
things
were
very
nicely
arranged
for
his
satisfaction
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
thought
of
he
did
think
of
her
a
great
deal
and
with
deep
should
have
enjoyed
himself
thoroughly
for
every
day
was
beautiful
and
every
day
brought
its
amusements
with
it
perhaps
on
arriving
at
the
quinta
carr
about
eleven
he
would
find
that
the
steam
launch
was
waiting
for
them
in
a
little
bay
where
the
cliff
on
which
the
house
stood
curved
inwards
then
a
merry
party
of
young
english
folks
all
collected
together
by
carr
that
morning
by
the
dint
of
superhuman
efforts
they
would
scramble
down
the
steps
cut
in
the
rock
and
steam
off
to
some
neighbouring
islet
to
eat
luncheon
and
wander
about
collecting
shells
and
flowers
and
beetles
till
sunset
and
then
steam
back
again
through
the
spicy
evening
air
laughing
and
flirting
and
making
the
night
melodious
with
their
songs
or
else
the
horses
would
be
ordered
out
and
they
would
wander
over
the
lonely
mountains
in
the
interior
of
the
island
talking
of
mummies
and
all
things
human
of
angela
and
all
things
divine
and
sometimes
in
the
course
of
these
conversations
arthur
would
in
a
brotherly
way
call
carr
while
occasionally
in
the
tone
of
a
spinster
aunt
she
would
address
him
as
a
practice
that
once
acquired
she
soon
found
was
like
all
other
bad
habits
not
easy
to
get
rid
of
for
somehow
in
all
these
expeditions
she
was
continually
at
his
side
striving
and
not
without
success
to
weave
herself
into
the
substance
of
his
life
and
to
make
herself
indispensable
to
him
till
at
last
he
grew
to
look
upon
her
almost
as
a
sister
but
beyond
this
he
never
went
and
to
her
advances
he
was
as
cold
as
ice
simply
because
he
never
noticed
them
and
she
was
afraid
of
making
them
more
obvious
for
fear
that
she
would
frighten
him
away
he
thought
it
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
that
he
and
mildred
should
live
together
like
brother
and
sister
and
be
very
fond
of
each
other
as
whilst
she
thought
what
he
blindest
of
fools
and
then
loved
him
the
more
for
his
folly
the
sisterly
relationship
did
not
possess
the
same
charms
for
mildred
that
it
did
for
arthur
they
looked
at
matters
from
different
points
of
view
one
morning
peeping
through
a
big
telescope
that
was
fixed
in
the
window
of
the
little
boudoir
which
formed
an
entrance
lobby
to
the
museum
carr
saw
a
cloud
of
smoke
upon
the
horizon
presently
the
point
of
a
mast
poked
up
through
the
vapour
as
though
the
vessel
were
rising
out
of
the
ocean
then
two
more
mastheads
and
a
red
and
black
funnel
and
last
of
all
a
great
grey
hull
called
out
carr
with
one
eye
still
fixed
to
the
telescope
and
the
remainder
of
her
little
face
all
screwed
up
in
her
efforts
to
keep
the
other
closed
the
mail
i
can
see
the
donald
currie
flag
a
white
c
on
a
blue
i
am
sure
mildred
no
need
for
you
to
make
your
face
look
like
a
monkey
if
it
is
you
look
just
as
though
the
corner
of
your
mouth
were
changing
places
with
your
you
are
dreadfully
rude
when
the
fairies
took
your
endowments
in
hand
they
certainly
did
not
forget
the
gift
of
plain
speech
i
shall
appeal
to
heigham
do
i
look
like
a
monkey
heigham
no
on
second
thoughts
i
wait
for
the
inevitable
compliment
arthur
hold
your
tongue
and
i
will
tell
you
something
that
must
be
the
new
boat
the
and
i
want
to
see
over
her
captain
smithson
who
is
bringing
her
out
has
got
a
box
of
things
for
me
what
do
you
say
if
we
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
go
and
see
the
vessel
and
get
our
luncheon
on
am
at
your
service
answered
arthur
lazily
would
you
like
to
have
the
compliment
apropos
of
the
monkey
i
have
thought
of
something
extremely
neat
on
any
account
i
hate
compliments
that
are
not
meant
and
her
eyes
gave
a
little
flash
which
put
a
point
to
her
words
i
suppose
that
you
will
come
yes
dear
the
bay
looks
pretty
yes
you
might
sail
across
it
in
a
paper
ship
yawned
arthur
sake
look
so
lazy
heigham
but
ring
the
bell
that
one
the
electric
let
us
order
the
launch
at
once
the
mail
will
be
at
anchor
in
about
an
arthur
did
as
he
was
bid
and
within
that
time
they
were
steaming
through
the
throng
of
boats
already
surrounding
the
steamer
gracious
mildred
suddenly
exclaimed
agatha
you
see
who
that
is
there
leaning
over
the
bulwarks
oh
gone
but
so
sure
as
i
am
a
living
woman
it
was
lord
minster
and
lady
florence
thingumebob
his
sister
you
know
the
pretty
mildred
looked
vexed
and
glanced
involuntarily
at
arthur
who
was
steering
the
launch
for
a
moment
she
hesitated
about
going
on
and
glanced
again
at
arthur
the
look
seemed
to
inspire
her
for
she
said
nothing
and
presently
he
brought
the
boat
deftly
alongside
the
gangway
ladder
the
captain
of
the
ship
had
already
come
to
the
side
to
meet
her
having
recognized
her
from
the
bridge
indeed
there
was
scarcely
a
man
in
donald
service
who
did
not
know
carr
at
any
rate
by
sight
do
you
do
carr
are
you
coming
on
to
south
africa
with
us
captain
smithson
i
or
rather
we
are
coming
to
lunch
and
to
see
your
new
boat
and
last
but
not
least
to
claim
my
carr
will
you
ever
forgive
me
i
have
lost
it
my
box
captain
smithson
or
i
will
never
speak
to
you
again
do
more
go
over
to
the
union
which
case
i
am
afraid
donald
currie
would
never
speak
to
me
again
i
must
certainly
try
to
find
that
box
and
he
whispered
an
order
to
a
quartermaster
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
come
and
lunch
and
i
hope
that
you
and
your
friends
will
do
so
with
me
till
then
i
must
be
as
soon
as
they
got
on
the
arthur
perceived
a
tall
man
with
an
eyeglass
whom
he
seemed
to
know
bearing
down
upon
them
followed
by
a
girl
about
twenty
years
of
age
remarkable
for
her
pleasant
eyes
and
the
humorous
expression
of
her
mouth
do
you
do
carr
said
the
tall
man
suppose
that
you
heard
that
we
were
coming
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
come
and
meet
had
not
the
slightest
idea
that
you
were
coming
and
i
did
not
come
to
meet
you
lord
minster
i
came
to
lunch
answered
carr
rather
coldly
one
for
james
that
very
murmured
lady
florence
it
will
do
him
was
determined
to
come
and
look
you
up
as
soon
as
i
got
time
but
the
house
sat
very
late
however
i
have
got
a
fortnight
here
now
and
shall
see
plenty
of
good
deal
too
much
i
daresay
lord
minster
but
let
me
introduce
you
to
lord
minster
glanced
casually
at
arthur
and
lifting
his
hat
about
an
eighth
of
an
inch
was
about
to
resume
his
conversation
when
arthur
who
was
rather
nettled
by
this
treatment
said
think
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
before
lord
minster
we
were
stopping
together
at
the
stanley
foxes
last
foxes
ah
quite
so
forgive
my
forgetfulness
but
one
meets
so
many
people
you
see
and
he
turned
round
to
where
carr
had
been
but
that
lady
had
taken
the
opportunity
to
retreat
lord
minster
at
once
followed
her
if
my
brother
has
forgotten
you
heigham
i
have
not
said
lady
florence
now
coming
forward
for
the
first
time
you
remember
when
we
went
nutting
together
and
i
tumbled
into
the
pond
i
do
lady
florence
and
i
tell
you
how
pleased
i
am
to
see
you
again
are
you
here
for
long
indefinite
time
an
old
aunt
of
mine
velley
is
coming
out
by
next
mail
and
i
am
going
to
stop
with
her
when
my
brother
goes
back
are
you
staying
with
carr
no
only
i
know
her
very
you
admire
her
you
like
mean
my
not
he
also
admires
her
both
admire
the
view
from
here
very
much
indeed
but
that
is
no
reason
why
you
and
i
should
not
like
each
but
then
you
see
there
is
a
difference
between
lovely
scenery
and
lovely
there
is
said
arthur
at
this
moment
lord
minster
returned
with
carr
do
you
do
lady
florence
said
the
latter
me
introduce
you
to
heigham
what
do
you
already
know
each
other
yes
carr
we
are
old
indeed
that
is
very
charming
for
it
is
said
lady
florence
frankly
we
must
be
off
now
right
james
you
both
come
and
dine
with
me
sans
façon
there
will
be
nobody
else
except
agatha
and
heigham
asked
carr
shall
be
delighted
said
lord
minster
then
nodded
lady
florence
to
arthur
and
they
separated
when
after
lunching
and
seeing
round
the
ship
miss
terry
and
arthur
found
themselves
in
the
steam
launch
waiting
for
carr
who
was
saying
to
the
captain
and
looking
after
her
precious
box
arthur
took
the
opportunity
to
ask
his
companion
what
she
knew
of
lord
minster
not
much
that
is
nothing
in
particular
except
that
he
is
the
son
of
a
or
something
who
was
made
a
peer
for
some
reason
or
other
and
i
suppose
that
is
why
he
is
so
stuck
up
because
all
the
other
peers
i
ever
met
are
just
like
other
people
he
is
very
clever
too
is
in
the
government
now
and
always
hanging
about
after
mildred
he
wants
to
marry
her
you
know
and
i
expect
that
he
will
at
last
but
i
hope
he
i
like
him
he
always
looks
at
one
as
though
one
were
deuce
he
does
ejaculated
arthur
his
heart
filling
on
the
instant
with
envy
hatred
malice
and
all
uncharitableness
towards
lord
minster
he
had
not
the
slightest
wish
to
marry
mildred
himself
but
he
boiled
at
the
mere
thought
of
anybody
else
doing
so
lady
florence
was
right
there
is
a
difference
between
ladies
and
landscapes
at
that
moment
mildred
herself
arrived
but
so
disgusted
was
he
that
he
would
scarcely
speak
to
her
and
on
arriving
at
the
landing
stage
he
at
once
departed
to
the
hotel
and
even
tried
to
get
out
of
coming
to
dinner
that
night
but
this
was
overruled
said
mildred
to
herself
with
a
smile
have
found
out
how
to
vex
at
dinner
that
evening
lord
minster
who
had
of
course
taken
his
hostess
in
opened
the
conversation
by
asking
her
how
she
had
been
employing
herself
at
madeira
than
you
have
at
lord
minster
at
any
rate
i
have
not
been
forwarding
schemes
for
highway
robbery
and
the
national
disgrace
she
answered
laughing
suppose
that
you
mean
the
irish
land
act
and
the
transvaal
convention
i
have
heard
several
ladies
speak
of
them
like
that
and
i
am
really
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
your
sex
is
entirely
devoid
of
political
do
you
mean
by
political
instinct
lord
minster
asked
arthur
political
instinct
he
replied
understand
a
proper
appreciation
of
the
science
and
object
of
me
what
are
they
asked
carr
the
science
of
government
consists
roughly
speaking
in
knowing
how
to
get
into
office
and
remain
there
when
once
in
its
objects
are
to
guess
and
give
expression
to
the
prevailing
popular
feeling
or
whim
with
the
loss
of
as
few
votes
as
to
that
definition
said
arthur
national
questions
are
or
should
be
treated
by
those
who
understand
the
and
objects
of
on
a
basis
i
mean
they
should
be
dealt
with
as
an
investor
deals
with
his
funds
in
order
to
make
as
much
out
of
them
as
possible
not
to
bring
real
benefit
to
the
put
the
matter
rather
awkwardly
but
i
think
i
follow
you
i
will
try
to
explain
in
the
first
place
all
the
jingo
nonsense
about
patriotism
and
the
of
the
has
if
people
only
knew
it
quite
exploded
it
only
lingers
in
a
certain
section
of
the
landed
gentry
and
a
proportion
of
the
upper
middle
class
and
has
no
serious
weight
with
leading
about
lord
beaconsfield
he
was
perhaps
an
exception
but
then
he
was
a
man
with
so
large
a
say
it
though
i
detested
he
could
actually
by
a
sort
of
political
prescience
see
into
the
far
future
and
shape
his
course
accordingly
but
even
in
his
case
i
do
not
believe
that
he
was
actuated
by
patriotism
but
rather
by
a
keener
insight
into
human
affairs
than
most
men
yet
he
came
terribly
to
he
outflew
his
age
the
will
of
the
means
the
will
of
between
five
hundred
thousand
and
a
million
hungry
fluctuating
not
wait
for
the
development
of
his
imperial
schemes
they
wanted
plunder
in
the
present
not
honour
and
prosperity
for
the
empire
in
the
future
the
instinct
of
robbery
is
perhaps
the
strongest
in
human
nature
and
those
who
would
rule
humanity
on
its
present
basis
must
pander
to
it
or
fail
the
party
of
progress
means
the
party
that
can
give
most
spoil
taken
from
those
that
have
to
those
that
have
not
that
is
why
gladstone
is
such
a
truly
great
man
he
understands
better
than
any
one
of
his
age
how
to
excite
the
greed
of
hungry
voters
and
to
guide
it
for
his
own
ends
what
was
the
midlothian
campaign
but
a
crusade
of
plunder
first
he
excited
the
desire
then
he
promised
to
satisfy
it
of
course
that
is
impossible
but
at
the
time
he
was
believed
and
his
promises
floated
us
triumphantly
into
power
the
same
arguments
apply
to
that
body
of
electors
whose
motive
power
is
folly
must
be
pandered
to
for
instance
the
transvaal
convention
that
carr
mentioned
is
an
admirable
example
of
how
such
pandering
is
done
no
man
of
experience
can
have
believed
that
such
an
agreement
could
be
wise
or
that
it
can
result
in
anything
but
trouble
and
humiliation
but
the
trouble
and
humiliation
will
not
come
just
yet
and
in
the
meanwhile
a
sop
is
thrown
to
cerberus
political
memories
are
short
and
when
exposure
comes
it
will
be
easy
to
fix
the
blame
upon
the
other
side
it
is
because
we
appreciate
these
facts
that
in
the
end
we
must
prevail
the
liberal
party
or
rather
the
radical
section
which
is
to
the
great
liberal
party
what
the
helm
is
to
the
ship
appeals
to
the
baser
instincts
and
more
pressing
appetites
of
the
people
the
conservative
only
to
their
traditions
and
higher
aspirations
in
the
same
way
that
religion
appeals
to
the
spirit
and
the
worship
of
mammon
to
the
senses
the
shibboleth
of
the
one
is
of
the
other
the
first
appeals
to
the
many
the
second
to
the
finer
few
and
i
must
leave
you
to
judge
which
will
carry
the
if
ever
you
become
prime
minister
shall
you
rule
england
upon
these
principles
asked
carr
it
is
because
i
have
mastered
them
that
i
am
what
i
am
i
owe
everything
to
them
consequently
in
my
view
they
are
the
finest
of
all
heaven
help
england
soliloquized
arthur
rudely
so
say
we
all
added
lady
florence
who
was
a
strong
conservative
dear
young
people
answered
lord
minster
with
a
superior
smile
is
quite
capable
of
looking
after
herself
i
have
to
look
after
myself
she
will
at
any
rate
last
my
time
and
my
motto
is
that
one
should
get
something
out
of
country
not
attempt
to
do
her
services
that
would
in
all
probability
never
be
recognized
or
if
recognized
left
arthur
was
about
to
answer
with
more
sharpness
than
discretion
but
carr
interposed
lord
minster
we
have
to
thank
you
for
a
very
cynical
and
lucid
explanation
of
the
objects
of
your
party
if
they
really
are
its
objects
will
you
give
me
some
wine
after
dinner
carr
devoted
herself
almost
exclusively
to
lord
minster
leaving
arthur
to
talk
to
lady
florence
lord
minster
was
not
slow
to
avail
himself
of
the
opportunity
have
been
thinking
of
your
remark
to
me
in
london
about
the
he
began
for
sake
drag
that
wretched
man
out
of
his
grave
lord
minster
i
really
have
forgotten
what
i
said
about
hope
carr
that
you
have
forgotten
a
good
deal
you
said
that
day
i
may
as
well
take
this
please
lord
minster
she
answered
knowing
very
well
what
was
coming
am
so
tired
in
that
case
i
can
easily
postpone
my
statement
i
have
a
whole
fortnight
before
carr
secretly
determined
that
it
should
remain
as
much
as
possible
at
his
own
exclusive
disposal
but
she
did
not
say
so
shortly
after
this
arthur
took
his
leave
after
shaking
hands
very
coldly
with
her
nor
did
he
come
to
the
quinta
next
day
as
he
had
conceived
too
great
a
detestation
of
lord
minster
to
risk
meeting
him
a
detestation
which
he
attributed
solely
to
that
rising
member
of
the
political
principles
which
jarred
very
much
with
his
own
and
better
said
carr
to
herself
as
she
took
off
her
dress
lord
minster
is
really
odious
i
can
not
stand
him
for
chapter
xlii
arthur
i
had
almost
forgotten
what
you
are
like
said
mildred
when
that
young
gentleman
at
last
put
in
an
appearance
at
the
quinta
have
you
been
to
all
this
time
i
have
been
writing
letters
said
arthur
they
must
have
been
very
long
ones
tell
fibs
arthur
you
have
not
stopped
away
from
here
for
a
day
and
a
half
in
order
to
write
letters
what
is
the
matter
with
you
if
you
must
know
mildred
i
detest
your
friend
lord
minster
the
mere
sight
of
him
sets
my
teeth
on
edge
and
i
did
not
want
to
meet
him
i
only
came
here
because
lady
florence
told
me
that
they
were
going
up
to
the
convent
this
you
have
been
to
see
lady
florence
i
met
her
buying
fruit
yesterday
and
went
for
a
walk
with
the
intervals
of
the
do
you
know
i
detest
lady
florence
is
very
unkind
of
you
she
is
your
point
of
view
perhaps
as
her
brother
is
from
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
think
that
horrid
fellow
charming
asked
arthur
in
disgust
should
i
not
for
the
matter
of
that
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
but
i
congratulate
you
either
on
your
friend
or
your
my
taste
out
of
the
question
why
do
you
call
lord
minster
my
friend
miss
terry
told
me
that
he
was
she
said
that
he
was
always
proposing
to
you
and
that
you
would
probably
marry
him
in
the
mildred
blushed
faintly
has
no
business
to
tell
you
but
for
the
matter
of
that
so
have
many
other
men
it
does
not
follow
that
because
they
choose
to
propose
to
me
they
are
my
but
then
they
have
not
married
more
has
he
but
while
we
are
talking
of
it
why
should
i
not
marry
lord
minster
he
can
give
me
position
influence
everything
that
is
dear
to
a
woman
except
the
rarest
of
all
is
love
so
rare
mildred
the
love
that
it
can
satisfy
a
woman
either
to
receive
or
to
give
especially
the
latter
for
in
this
we
are
more
blessed
in
giving
than
in
receiving
it
is
but
very
rarely
that
the
most
fortunate
of
us
get
a
chance
of
accepting
such
love
as
i
mean
and
we
can
only
give
it
once
in
our
lives
but
you
have
not
told
me
your
reasons
against
my
marrying
lord
he
is
a
selfish
man
if
he
were
not
he
could
not
have
talked
as
he
did
last
night
because
you
do
not
love
him
mildred
you
can
not
love
such
a
man
as
that
if
he
were
fifty
times
a
member
of
the
does
it
matter
to
you
arthur
she
said
in
a
voice
of
indescribable
softness
bending
her
sunny
head
low
over
her
work
i
love
him
or
not
my
doing
so
would
not
make
your
heart
beat
the
wish
you
to
marry
him
he
said
confusedly
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
full
at
him
with
eyes
which
shone
like
stars
through
a
summer
mist
is
enough
arthur
she
answered
in
a
tone
of
gentle
submission
you
do
not
wish
it
i
will
not
and
rising
she
left
the
room
arthur
blushed
furiously
at
her
words
and
a
new
sensation
crept
over
him
he
said
to
himself
can
not
no
of
course
she
only
means
that
she
will
take
my
but
though
he
dismissed
the
suspicion
thus
readily
it
left
something
that
he
could
not
quite
define
behind
it
he
had
after
the
manner
of
young
men
where
women
are
concerned
thought
that
he
understood
mildred
thoroughly
now
he
came
to
the
modest
conclusion
that
he
knew
very
little
about
her
on
the
following
afternoon
when
he
was
at
the
quinta
talking
as
usual
to
carr
he
saw
lord
minster
coming
up
the
steps
of
the
portico
dressed
in
much
the
same
way
and
with
exactly
the
same
air
as
he
was
accustomed
to
assume
when
he
mounted
those
of
the
or
occasionally
if
he
thought
that
the
wanted
to
those
of
the
new
said
arthur
comes
lord
minster
in
his
war
paint
frock
coat
tall
hat
and
all
do
you
go
away
arthur
stop
and
protect
me
said
mildred
laughing
no
indeed
i
want
to
spoil
sport
i
would
not
interfere
with
your
amusement
on
any
mildred
looked
a
little
vexed
you
will
come
back
to
dinner
depends
upon
what
told
you
what
would
happen
arthur
it
is
as
well
to
get
it
over
at
once
thought
mildred
in
the
hall
arthur
met
lord
minster
and
they
passed
with
a
gesture
of
recognition
so
infinitesimally
small
that
it
almost
faded
into
the
nothingness
of
a
so
far
as
he
could
condescend
to
notice
so
low
a
thing
at
all
his
lordship
had
conceived
a
great
dislike
for
arthur
do
you
do
lord
minster
said
mildred
cordially
hear
that
you
went
to
the
convent
yesterday
what
did
you
think
of
the
view
view
there
a
view
i
did
not
notice
it
indeed
i
only
went
up
there
at
all
to
please
florence
i
like
that
sort
of
you
like
roughing
it
i
am
afraid
that
you
did
not
enjoy
your
voyage
no
i
think
i
did
and
there
was
a
low
fellow
on
board
who
had
been
ruined
by
the
retrocession
of
the
transvaal
and
who
hearing
that
i
was
in
the
government
took
every
possible
opportunity
to
tell
me
publicly
that
his
wife
and
children
were
almost
in
a
state
of
starvation
as
though
i
cared
about
his
confounded
wife
and
children
he
was
positively
brutal
no
certainly
i
did
not
enjoy
it
however
i
am
rewarded
by
finding
you
am
very
much
lord
minster
fixed
his
firmly
in
his
eye
planted
his
hands
at
the
bottom
of
his
trousers
pockets
and
clearing
his
throat
placed
himself
in
the
attitude
that
was
so
familiar
to
the
house
and
began
carr
i
told
you
when
last
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
that
i
should
take
the
first
opportunity
of
renewing
a
conversation
that
i
was
forced
to
suspend
in
order
to
attend
if
my
memory
serves
me
a
very
important
committee
meeting
i
was
therefore
surprised
indeed
i
may
almost
say
hurt
when
i
found
that
you
had
suddenly
flitted
from
lord
minster
will
not
however
take
up
the
time
of
mean
your
time
by
recapitulating
all
that
i
told
you
on
that
occasion
the
facts
are
so
to
speak
all
upon
the
table
and
i
will
merely
touch
upon
the
main
heads
of
my
case
my
prospects
are
these
i
am
now
a
member
of
the
cabinet
and
enjoy
owing
to
the
unusual
but
calculated
recklessness
of
my
public
utterances
an
extraordinary
popularity
with
a
large
section
of
the
country
the
hungry
section
to
which
i
alluded
last
night
it
is
probable
that
the
course
of
the
present
government
is
pretty
nearly
run
the
country
is
sick
of
it
and
those
who
put
it
into
power
have
not
got
enough
out
of
it
a
dissolution
is
therefore
an
event
of
the
near
future
the
conservatives
will
come
in
but
they
have
no
power
of
organization
and
very
little
political
talent
at
their
backs
above
all
they
are
deficient
in
energy
probably
because
there
is
nothing
that
they
can
destroy
and
therefore
no
pickings
to
struggle
for
in
short
they
are
not
the
want
of
these
qualities
and
of
leaders
will
very
soon
undermine
their
hold
upon
the
country
always
a
slight
one
and
assisted
by
a
few
other
pushing
men
i
anticipate
by
carefully
playing
into
the
hands
of
the
irish
party
which
will
really
rule
england
in
the
future
being
able
as
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
opposition
to
consummate
their
downfall
then
will
come
my
opportunity
and
if
luck
goes
with
me
i
shall
be
first
lord
of
the
treasury
within
half
a
dozen
years
but
now
comes
the
difficulty
though
i
am
so
popular
with
the
country
i
am
for
some
reason
quite
inexplicable
to
myself
rather
at
discount
amongst
my
colleagues
and
that
influential
section
of
society
to
which
they
belong
now
in
order
to
succeed
to
the
full
extent
that
i
have
planned
it
is
absolutely
essential
that
i
should
win
the
countenance
of
this
class
and
the
only
way
that
i
can
see
of
doing
it
is
by
marrying
some
woman
charming
enough
to
disarm
dislike
beautiful
enough
to
command
admiration
rich
enough
to
entertain
profusely
and
clever
enough
to
rule
england
those
desiderata
are
all
to
a
striking
degree
united
in
your
person
carr
and
i
have
therefore
much
pleasure
in
asking
you
to
become
my
have
as
i
understand
you
lord
minster
made
a
very
admirable
statement
of
how
desirable
it
is
for
yourself
that
you
should
marry
me
but
it
is
not
so
clear
what
advantage
i
should
reap
by
marrying
the
advantages
are
obvious
if
by
your
help
i
can
become
prime
minister
you
would
become
the
wife
of
the
prime
prospect
fails
to
dazzle
me
i
have
everything
that
i
want
why
should
i
strive
to
reach
a
grandeur
to
which
i
was
not
born
and
which
to
speak
the
truth
i
regard
with
a
very
complete
indifference
but
there
is
another
point
in
all
your
speech
you
have
said
nothing
of
any
affection
that
you
have
to
offer
not
a
single
word
of
you
have
been
content
to
expatiate
on
the
profits
that
a
matrimonial
investment
would
bring
to
yourself
and
by
reflection
to
the
other
contracting
asked
lord
minster
with
an
expression
of
genuine
surprise
you
talk
like
a
character
in
a
novel
now
tell
me
carr
is
love
is
difficult
to
define
lord
minster
but
as
you
ask
me
to
do
so
i
will
try
love
to
a
woman
is
what
the
sun
is
to
the
world
it
is
her
life
her
animating
principle
without
which
she
must
droop
and
if
the
plant
be
very
tender
die
except
under
its
influence
a
woman
can
never
attain
her
full
growth
never
touch
the
height
of
her
possibilities
or
bloom
into
the
plenitude
of
her
moral
beauty
a
loveless
marriage
dwarfs
our
natures
a
marriage
where
love
is
develops
them
to
their
what
is
love
to
a
man
i
should
say
that
nine
of
a
passions
are
merely
episodes
in
his
career
the
that
mark
his
path
the
tenth
or
the
first
is
his
stone
that
turns
all
things
to
gold
or
if
the
charm
does
not
work
leaves
his
heart
broken
and
bankrupt
a
cold
monument
of
quite
follow
you
and
i
must
say
that
speaking
for
myself
i
never
felt
anything
of
all
this
said
lord
minster
blankly
know
you
do
not
lord
minster
your
only
passions
tend
towards
political
triumphs
and
personal
aggrandisement
we
are
at
the
two
poles
you
see
and
i
fear
that
we
can
never
never
meet
upon
a
common
matrimonial
line
but
be
about
it
you
will
find
plenty
more
women
who
fulfil
all
your
requirements
and
will
be
very
happy
to
take
you
at
your
own
valuation
if
only
a
woman
is
necessary
to
success
you
need
not
look
far
and
forgive
me
if
i
say
that
i
believe
it
will
not
make
much
difference
to
you
who
she
is
but
all
the
same
lord
minster
i
will
venture
to
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
next
time
you
propose
address
yourself
a
little
more
to
the
affections
and
a
little
less
to
her
interests
and
carr
rose
as
though
to
show
that
the
interview
was
at
an
end
i
then
to
understand
that
my
offer
is
definitely
refused
asked
lord
minster
stiffly
am
afraid
so
and
i
am
sure
that
you
will
on
reflection
see
how
utterly
unsuited
we
are
to
each
carr
possibly
at
present
all
that
i
see
is
that
you
have
had
a
great
opportunity
and
have
failed
to
avail
yourself
of
it
my
only
consolation
is
that
the
loss
will
be
yours
and
my
only
regret
is
that
i
have
had
the
trouble
of
coming
to
this
place
for
nothing
however
there
is
a
ship
due
and
i
shall
sail
in
am
sorry
to
have
been
the
cause
of
bringing
you
here
lord
minster
and
still
more
sorry
that
you
should
feel
obliged
to
cut
short
your
stay
lord
minster
we
part
friends
i
hope
certainly
carr
i
wish
you
a
very
good
morning
carr
and
his
lordship
marched
out
of
life
goes
my
chance
of
becoming
the
wife
of
a
prime
minister
and
making
a
figure
in
history
said
that
lady
as
she
watched
his
tall
figure
stalking
stiffly
down
the
avenue
i
am
glad
of
it
i
would
just
as
soon
have
married
a
stuffed
full
of
the
purest
radical
on
the
following
day
arthur
met
lady
florence
again
in
the
town
have
you
been
to
lady
florence
he
said
see
my
brother
off
she
answered
without
any
signs
of
deep
grief
has
he
gone
already
your
friend
carr
has
been
too
many
for
poor
do
you
mean
that
he
has
been
proposing
and
got
more
than
he
bargained
he
cut
up
no
but
his
vanity
is
you
see
heigham
it
is
this
way
my
brother
may
be
a
very
great
man
and
a
pillar
of
the
state
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
say
he
but
from
personal
experience
i
that
he
is
an
awful
prig
and
thinks
that
all
women
are
machines
constructed
to
advance
the
comfort
of
your
noble
sex
well
he
has
come
down
a
peg
or
two
all
and
he
like
it
bye
in
a
lady
florence
was
nothing
if
not
outspoken
chapter
xliii
a
week
or
so
after
the
departure
of
lord
minster
mildred
suggested
that
they
should
on
the
following
day
vary
their
amusements
by
going
up
to
the
convent
a
building
perched
on
the
hills
some
thousand
feet
above
the
town
of
funchal
in
palanquins
or
rather
hammocks
swung
upon
long
poles
arthur
who
had
never
yet
travelled
in
these
luxurious
conveyances
jumped
at
the
idea
and
even
miss
terry
when
she
discovered
that
she
was
to
be
carried
made
no
objection
the
party
was
completed
by
the
addition
of
a
couple
of
whom
carr
had
known
something
at
home
and
who
had
come
to
madeira
to
spend
the
honeymoon
lady
florence
also
had
been
asked
but
rather
to
disappointment
she
could
not
come
when
the
long
line
of
swinging
hammocks
each
with
its
two
sturdy
bearers
were
marshalled
and
the
adventurous
voyagers
had
settled
themselves
in
them
they
really
formed
quite
an
imposing
procession
headed
as
it
was
by
the
one
that
carried
miss
terry
who
complained
bitterly
that
thing
wobbled
and
made
her
feel
but
to
mind
there
was
something
effeminate
in
allowing
himself
a
strong
active
man
to
be
carted
up
hills
as
steep
as
the
side
of
a
house
by
two
perspiring
wretches
so
hot
as
it
was
he
to
the
intense
amusement
of
his
bearers
elected
to
get
out
and
walk
the
man
followed
his
example
and
for
a
while
they
went
on
together
till
presently
the
latter
gravitated
towards
his
palanquin
and
overcome
at
so
long
a
separation
squeezed
her
hand
between
the
curtains
not
wishing
to
intrude
himself
on
their
conjugal
felicity
arthur
in
his
turn
gravitated
to
the
side
of
carr
who
was
being
lightly
swung
along
in
the
second
palanquin
some
twenty
yards
behind
miss
shortly
afterwards
they
observed
a
signal
of
distress
being
flown
by
that
lady
whose
arm
was
to
be
seen
violently
agitating
her
green
veil
from
between
the
curtains
of
her
hammock
which
immediately
came
to
a
dead
stop
is
it
cried
arthur
and
mildred
in
a
breath
as
they
arrived
on
the
scene
of
the
supposed
disaster
dear
mildred
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
that
pointing
to
her
front
bearer
a
stout
flabby
individual
he
must
not
go
on
carrying
me
i
must
have
a
cooler
man
it
makes
me
positively
ill
to
see
him
puffing
and
blowing
and
dripping
under
my
nose
like
a
fresh
basted
miss
realistic
description
of
her
appearance
which
was
to
say
the
least
of
it
limp
and
moist
was
no
exaggeration
but
then
she
herself
as
arthur
well
remembered
was
no
especially
when
as
in
the
present
case
she
had
to
be
carted
up
the
side
of
a
nearly
perpendicular
hill
some
miles
long
a
fact
very
well
exemplified
by
the
condition
of
the
bearer
dear
agatha
replied
mildred
laughing
is
to
be
done
of
course
the
man
is
hot
you
are
not
a
but
what
is
to
be
done
know
but
i
go
on
with
him
simply
disgusting
he
might
let
himself
out
as
a
we
get
another
he
must
cool
himself
the
others
might
come
and
fan
him
i
go
on
till
he
is
cool
and
will
take
hours
to
cool
and
meanwhile
we
are
broiling
on
this
hot
road
you
really
must
come
on
have
it
said
arthur
terry
must
turn
herself
round
with
her
head
towards
the
back
of
the
hammock
and
then
she
see
to
this
arrangement
the
aggrieved
lady
was
after
some
difficulty
persuaded
to
accede
and
the
procession
started
again
their
destination
reached
they
picnicked
as
they
had
arranged
and
then
separated
the
bride
and
bridegroom
strolling
off
in
one
direction
and
mildred
and
arthur
in
another
whilst
miss
terry
mounted
guard
over
the
plates
and
dishes
presently
arthur
and
mildred
came
to
a
little
grove
of
pine
and
oak
that
extended
down
a
gentle
slope
and
was
bordered
by
a
steep
bank
at
the
foot
of
which
great
ferns
and
beautiful
madeira
flowers
twined
themselves
into
a
shelter
from
the
heat
here
they
sat
down
and
gazed
at
the
splendid
and
view
set
in
its
background
of
emerald
ocean
a
view
it
is
said
arthur
mildred
how
dark
the
clumps
of
look
against
the
green
of
the
vines
and
how
pretty
the
red
roofs
of
the
town
are
peeping
out
of
the
groves
of
do
you
see
the
great
shadow
thrown
upon
the
sea
by
that
cliff
how
deep
and
cool
the
water
looks
within
it
and
how
it
sparkles
where
the
sun
it
is
beautiful
and
the
pines
smell
wish
angela
could
see
it
he
said
half
to
himself
mildred
who
was
lying
back
lazily
among
the
ferns
her
hat
off
her
eyes
closed
so
that
the
long
dark
lashes
lay
upon
her
cheek
and
her
head
resting
on
her
arm
suddenly
started
up
is
the
matter
you
woke
me
from
a
sort
of
dream
spring
i
remember
going
with
her
to
look
at
a
view
near
the
abbey
house
and
i
often
think
when
i
look
at
anything
beautiful
and
full
of
it
depressed
one
to
know
that
all
this
was
so
much
food
for
death
and
its
beauty
a
thing
that
is
and
is
what
did
she
say
said
that
to
her
it
spoke
of
immortality
and
that
in
everything
around
her
she
saw
evidence
of
eternal
must
be
very
fortunate
shall
i
tell
you
of
what
it
reminds
me
neither
death
nor
immortality
but
of
the
full
happy
pulsing
existence
of
the
hour
and
of
the
beautiful
world
that
pessimists
like
yourself
and
mystics
like
your
angela
think
so
poorly
of
but
which
is
really
so
glorious
and
so
rich
in
joy
why
this
sunlight
and
those
flowers
and
the
wide
sparkle
of
that
sea
are
each
and
all
a
happiness
and
the
health
in
our
veins
and
the
beauty
in
our
eyes
deep
pleasures
that
we
never
realize
till
we
lose
them
death
indeed
comes
to
us
all
but
why
add
to
its
terrors
by
thinking
of
them
whilst
it
is
far
off
and
as
for
life
after
death
it
is
a
faint
vague
thing
more
likely
to
be
horrible
than
happy
this
world
is
our
only
reality
the
only
thing
that
we
can
grasp
here
alone
we
that
we
can
enjoy
and
yet
how
we
waste
our
short
opportunities
for
enjoyment
soon
youth
will
have
slipped
away
and
we
shall
be
too
old
for
love
roses
fade
fastest
arthur
when
the
sun
is
bright
in
the
evening
when
they
have
fallen
and
the
ground
is
red
with
withering
petals
do
you
not
think
we
shall
wish
that
we
had
gathered
more
is
a
pleasant
philosophy
mildred
he
said
struggling
faintly
in
his
own
mind
against
her
conclusions
but
at
this
moment
somehow
his
fingers
touched
her
own
and
were
presently
locked
fast
within
her
little
palm
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
they
sat
hand
in
hand
but
happily
for
him
he
did
not
venture
to
look
into
her
eyes
and
before
many
minutes
had
passed
miss
voice
was
heard
calling
him
loudly
suppose
that
you
must
go
said
mildred
with
a
shade
of
vexation
in
her
voice
and
a
good
many
shades
upon
her
face
she
will
be
blundering
down
here
i
will
come
too
it
is
time
for
on
arriving
at
the
spot
whence
the
sounds
proceeded
they
found
miss
terry
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
laughing
and
excited
bearers
and
pouring
out
a
flood
of
the
most
vigorous
english
upon
an
unfortunate
islander
who
stood
a
silver
mug
in
each
hand
bowing
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
enunciating
with
every
variety
of
movement
indicative
of
humiliation
these
mystic
words
washeeuppee
signora
the
matter
now
agatha
why
i
woke
up
and
found
this
man
stealing
the
cups
i
charged
him
at
once
with
my
umbrella
but
he
dodged
and
i
fell
down
and
the
umbrella
has
gone
over
the
rock
there
take
him
up
at
once
the
stolen
property
on
his
person
hand
him
over
to
gracious
agatha
what
are
you
thinking
about
the
poor
man
only
wants
to
wash
the
things
i
should
like
to
know
why
he
could
not
tell
me
so
in
plain
english
said
miss
terry
retiring
discomfited
amidst
shouts
of
laughter
from
the
whole
party
including
the
supposed
thief
after
tea
they
all
set
out
on
a
grand
expedition
and
so
intent
were
they
upon
this
fascinating
pursuit
that
they
did
not
note
the
flight
of
time
till
suddenly
mildred
pulling
out
her
watch
gave
a
pretty
cry
of
alarm
you
know
what
time
it
is
good
people
six
and
the
custances
are
to
dine
with
us
at
a
it
will
take
us
a
good
hour
to
get
down
what
we
do
know
said
arthur
are
two
sledges
just
below
i
saw
them
as
we
came
up
they
will
take
us
down
to
funchal
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
we
can
get
to
the
quinta
by
about
you
are
invaluable
the
very
thing
come
on
all
of
you
now
these
sledges
are
peculiar
to
madeira
being
made
on
the
principle
of
the
bullock
car
with
the
difference
that
they
travel
down
the
smooth
roadways
by
their
own
momentum
guided
by
two
skilled
conductors
each
with
one
foot
naked
to
prevent
his
slipping
who
hold
the
ropes
and
when
the
sledge
begins
to
travel
more
swiftly
than
they
can
follow
mount
upon
the
projecting
ends
of
the
runners
and
are
carried
with
it
by
means
of
the
swift
and
exhilarating
rush
of
these
sledges
the
traveller
traverses
the
distance
that
it
takes
some
hours
to
climb
in
a
very
few
minutes
indeed
his
journey
up
and
down
may
be
very
well
compared
with
that
of
the
british
sailor
who
took
five
hours
to
get
up
majuba
mountain
but
according
to
his
own
forcibly
told
story
came
down
again
with
an
almost
incredible
rapidity
it
may
therefore
be
imagined
that
travelling
in
madeira
is
not
very
well
suited
to
nervous
voyagers
miss
terry
had
at
times
seen
these
wheelless
vehicles
shoot
from
the
top
of
a
mountain
to
the
bottom
like
a
balloon
with
the
gas
out
and
had
also
heard
of
occasional
accidents
in
connection
with
them
stoutly
she
vowed
that
nothing
should
induce
her
to
trust
her
neck
to
one
of
them
you
must
agatha
or
else
be
left
behind
they
are
as
safe
as
a
church
and
i
leave
the
custances
to
wait
till
eight
for
dinner
come
get
in
arthur
can
go
in
front
and
hold
you
i
will
sit
thus
terry
entered
groaning
arthur
taking
his
seat
beside
her
and
carr
hers
in
a
sort
of
dickey
behind
the
married
pair
who
did
not
half
like
it
possessed
themselves
of
the
smaller
sledge
determined
to
brave
extinction
in
each
arms
then
the
conductors
seized
the
ropes
and
planting
their
one
naked
foot
firmly
before
them
awaited
the
signal
to
depart
said
miss
terry
lifting
the
recovered
umbrella
man
has
forgotten
to
put
on
his
shoe
and
stocking
on
his
right
leg
he
will
cut
his
foot
and
besides
it
look
respectable
to
be
seen
flying
through
a
place
with
a
her
go
shouted
arthur
and
they
did
to
some
purpose
for
in
a
minute
they
were
passing
down
that
hill
like
a
flash
of
light
woods
and
houses
appeared
and
vanished
like
the
visions
of
a
dream
and
the
soft
air
went
singing
away
on
either
side
of
them
as
they
clove
it
flying
downwards
at
an
angle
of
thirty
degrees
and
leaving
nothing
behind
them
but
the
sound
of
miss
lamentations
soon
they
neared
the
bottom
but
there
was
yet
a
deepest
of
them
all
with
a
sharp
turn
at
the
end
of
be
traversed
away
went
the
little
connubial
sled
in
front
like
a
pigeon
down
the
wind
away
they
sped
after
it
like
an
eagle
in
pursuit
went
the
little
sledge
into
the
corner
and
out
shot
the
happy
pair
went
the
big
sledge
into
it
and
arthur
became
conscious
of
a
wild
yell
of
a
green
veil
fluttering
through
the
air
and
of
a
fall
as
on
to
a
miss
superior
weight
had
brought
her
to
her
mother
earth
the
first
and
he
after
a
higher
heavenward
flight
had
lit
upon
the
top
of
her
he
picked
her
up
and
sat
her
down
against
a
wall
to
recover
her
breath
and
then
fished
mildred
dirty
and
bruised
but
as
usual
laughing
out
of
a
gutter
the
loving
pair
had
already
risen
and
in
an
agony
of
mutual
anxiety
were
rubbing
each
shins
and
then
he
started
back
with
a
cry
for
there
before
him
surveying
the
disaster
with
an
air
of
mingled
amusement
and
benevolence
john
and
lady
bellamy
had
it
been
the
prince
and
princess
of
as
is
probable
there
is
a
could
scarcely
have
been
more
astounded
somehow
he
had
always
in
his
thoughts
regarded
sir
john
and
lady
bellamy
when
he
thought
about
them
at
all
as
possessing
indeed
individual
characters
and
tendencies
but
as
completely
of
the
neighbourhood
of
the
abbey
house
as
that
house
itself
he
would
as
soon
have
expected
to
see
staff
in
the
soil
of
madeira
as
to
find
them
strolling
about
funchal
he
rubbed
his
eyes
perhaps
he
thought
he
had
been
knocked
silly
and
was
labouring
under
a
hallucination
no
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
there
they
were
just
the
same
as
he
had
seen
them
at
isleworth
except
that
if
possible
sir
john
looked
even
more
like
a
ripe
apple
than
usual
while
the
sun
had
browned
his
egyptian
face
and
given
her
a
last
finish
as
a
perfect
type
of
cleopatra
nor
was
the
recognition
on
his
side
only
for
next
second
his
hand
was
grasped
first
by
sir
john
and
then
by
lady
bellamy
we
last
met
heigham
said
the
gentleman
with
a
benevolent
beam
think
i
expressed
a
wish
that
we
might
soon
renew
our
acquaintance
but
i
little
thought
under
what
circumstances
our
next
meeting
would
take
place
and
he
pointed
to
the
overturned
sledges
and
the
prostrate
sledgers
have
had
a
very
merciful
escape
chimed
in
lady
bellamy
cordially
so
many
hard
stones
about
affairs
might
have
ended
then
heigham
we
had
better
set
to
and
run
that
is
if
agatha
has
got
a
run
left
in
her
or
we
shall
be
late
after
all
thank
goodness
nobody
is
hurt
but
we
must
find
a
hammock
for
agatha
for
to
judge
from
her
groans
she
thinks
she
is
is
my
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
and
carr
stopped
short
observing
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
talking
to
strangers
not
let
me
detain
you
if
you
are
in
a
hurry
i
am
so
thankful
that
nobody
is
hurt
said
lady
bellamy
believe
that
we
are
stopping
at
the
same
hotel
heigham
i
saw
your
name
in
the
book
so
we
shall
have
plenty
of
opportunities
of
but
arthur
felt
that
there
was
one
question
which
he
must
ask
before
he
went
on
whether
or
no
it
exceeded
the
strict
letter
of
his
agreement
with
philip
so
calling
to
carr
that
he
was
coming
he
said
with
a
blush
was
miss
caresfoot
you
last
saw
her
lady
bellamy
well
she
answered
smiling
more
lovely
than
ever
added
her
husband
you
for
that
news
it
is
the
best
i
have
heard
for
some
time
for
the
present
we
shall
meet
at
breakfast
and
he
ran
on
after
the
others
happier
than
he
had
been
for
months
feeling
that
he
had
come
again
within
call
of
angela
and
as
though
he
had
never
sat
hand
in
hand
with
mildred
carr
chapter
xliv
at
breakfast
on
the
following
morning
arthur
as
he
had
anticipated
met
the
bellamys
sir
john
came
down
first
arrayed
in
true
english
fashion
in
a
tourist
suit
of
grey
and
presently
lady
bellamy
followed
as
she
entered
dressed
in
trailing
white
and
walked
slowly
up
the
long
table
every
eye
was
turned
upon
her
for
she
was
one
of
those
women
who
attract
attention
as
surely
and
unconsciously
as
a
magnet
attracts
iron
arthur
looking
with
the
rest
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
a
stranger
or
at
the
same
time
a
more
looking
woman
time
had
not
yet
touched
her
beauty
or
impaired
her
vigorous
constitution
and
at
forty
she
was
still
at
the
zenith
of
her
charms
the
dark
hair
that
threw
out
glinting
lights
of
copper
when
the
sun
struck
it
still
curled
in
its
clustering
ringlets
and
showed
no
line
of
grey
while
the
mysterious
eyes
and
the
coral
lips
were
as
full
of
rich
life
and
beauty
as
they
had
been
when
she
and
hilda
von
holtzhausen
first
met
at
rewtham
house
on
her
face
too
was
the
same
expression
of
quiet
power
of
conscious
superiority
and
calm
command
that
had
always
distinguished
it
arthur
tried
to
think
what
it
reminded
him
of
and
remembered
that
the
same
look
was
to
be
seen
upon
the
stone
features
of
some
of
the
egyptian
statues
in
museum
splendid
lady
bellamy
looks
he
said
almost
unconsciously
to
his
neighbour
sir
john
did
not
answer
and
arthur
glancing
up
to
learn
the
reason
saw
that
he
also
was
watching
the
approach
of
his
wife
and
that
his
face
was
contorted
with
a
sudden
spasm
of
intense
malice
and
hatred
whilst
his
little
eyes
glittered
threateningly
he
had
not
even
heard
the
remark
arthur
would
have
liked
to
whistle
he
had
surprised
a
secret
do
you
do
heigham
i
hope
that
you
are
not
bruised
after
your
tumble
yesterday
good
morning
arthur
rose
and
shook
hands
never
was
more
surprised
in
my
life
he
said
when
i
saw
you
and
sir
john
at
the
top
of
the
street
there
may
i
ask
what
brought
you
to
madeira
sir
health
answered
the
little
man
catarrh
influenza
and
all
infernal
husband
heigham
struck
in
lady
bellamy
in
her
full
rich
tones
a
severe
threatening
of
chest
disease
and
the
doctor
recommended
a
trip
to
some
warmer
climate
unfortunately
however
his
business
arrangements
will
not
permit
of
a
long
stay
we
only
stop
here
three
weeks
at
am
sorry
to
hear
that
you
are
not
well
sir
it
is
nothing
very
much
answered
lady
bellamy
for
him
he
requires
care
what
a
lovely
garden
this
it
not
by
the
way
i
forgot
to
inquire
after
the
ladies
who
shared
your
tumble
i
hope
that
they
were
none
the
worse
i
was
much
struck
with
one
of
them
the
very
pretty
person
with
the
brown
hair
whom
you
pulled
out
of
the
carr
yes
she
is
after
breakfast
arthur
volunteered
to
take
lady
bellamy
round
the
garden
with
the
ulterior
object
of
extracting
some
more
information
about
angela
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
had
no
cause
to
mistrust
that
lady
nor
had
he
any
knowledge
of
the
events
which
had
recently
happened
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
abbey
house
he
was
therefore
perfectly
frank
with
her
suppose
that
you
have
heard
of
my
engagement
lady
bellamy
yes
heigham
it
is
quite
a
subject
of
conversation
in
the
roxham
neighbourhood
angela
caresfoot
is
a
sweet
and
very
beautiful
girl
and
i
congratulate
you
know
then
of
its
conditions
i
heard
of
them
and
thought
them
ridiculous
indeed
i
tried
at
suggestion
to
do
you
a
good
turn
with
philip
caresfoot
and
get
him
to
modify
them
but
he
would
not
he
is
a
curious
man
philip
and
when
he
once
gets
a
thing
into
his
head
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
most
people
to
drive
it
out
again
i
suppose
that
you
are
spending
your
year
of
probation
here
am
trying
to
get
through
the
time
in
that
way
but
it
is
slow
thought
you
seemed
pretty
happy
yesterday
she
answered
smiling
arthur
blushed
yes
i
may
appear
to
be
but
tell
me
all
about
have
really
very
little
to
tell
she
seems
to
be
living
as
usual
and
looks
well
her
friend
fraser
has
come
back
but
i
must
be
going
in
i
have
promised
to
go
out
walking
with
sir
john
left
to
himself
arthur
remembered
that
he
also
had
an
appointment
to
to
meet
mildred
by
the
cathedral
steps
and
go
with
her
to
choose
some
madeira
jewellery
an
undertaking
which
she
did
not
feel
competent
to
carry
out
without
his
assistance
when
he
reached
the
cathedral
he
found
her
rather
cross
at
having
been
kept
waiting
for
ten
minutes
is
very
rude
of
you
she
said
i
suppose
that
you
were
so
taken
up
with
the
conversation
of
your
friends
that
you
forgot
the
time
by
the
way
who
are
they
anybody
you
have
told
me
about
in
the
pauses
of
selecting
the
jewellery
arthur
told
her
all
he
knew
about
the
bellamys
and
of
their
connection
with
the
neighbourhood
of
the
abbey
house
the
story
caused
mildred
to
open
her
brown
eyes
and
look
thoughtful
just
as
they
came
out
of
the
shop
who
should
they
run
into
but
the
bellamys
themselves
chaffering
for
madeira
work
with
a
woman
in
the
street
arthur
stopped
and
spoke
to
them
and
then
introduced
carr
who
after
a
little
conversation
asked
them
up
to
lunch
after
this
mildred
and
lady
bellamy
met
a
good
deal
the
two
women
interested
each
other
one
night
when
the
bellamys
had
been
about
ten
days
in
madeira
the
conversation
took
a
personal
turn
sir
john
and
arthur
were
sitting
over
their
wine
they
were
dining
with
carr
agatha
terry
was
fast
asleep
on
a
sofa
so
that
lady
bellamy
and
mildred
seated
upon
by
a
table
with
a
light
on
it
placed
by
an
open
window
were
practically
alone
by
the
way
lady
bellamy
said
mildred
after
a
pause
believe
that
you
are
acquainted
with
the
young
lady
to
whom
heigham
is
engaged
she
had
meant
to
say
be
married
but
the
words
stuck
in
her
throat
yes
i
know
her
am
so
glad
i
am
quite
curious
to
hear
what
she
is
like
one
can
never
put
much
faith
in
raptures
you
you
mean
in
person
or
in
character
angela
caresfoot
is
as
lovely
a
woman
as
ever
i
saw
with
a
noble
figure
head
and
magnificent
eyes
and
mildred
turned
a
little
pale
and
bit
her
lips
to
her
character
i
can
hardly
describe
it
she
lives
in
an
atmosphere
of
her
own
an
atmosphere
that
i
can
not
reach
or
at
any
rate
can
not
breathe
but
if
you
can
imagine
a
woman
whose
mind
is
enriched
with
learning
as
profound
as
that
of
the
first
classical
scholars
of
the
day
and
tinged
with
an
originality
all
her
own
a
woman
whose
faith
is
as
steady
as
that
star
and
whose
love
is
deep
as
the
sea
and
as
definite
as
its
tides
who
lives
to
higher
ends
than
those
we
strive
for
whose
whole
life
indeed
gives
one
the
idea
that
it
is
the
perhaps
but
still
the
an
immortal
light
then
you
will
get
some
idea
of
angela
caresfoot
she
is
a
woman
intellectually
physically
and
spiritually
immeasurably
above
the
man
on
whom
she
has
set
her
can
not
be
said
mildred
softly
draws
to
like
she
must
have
found
something
in
him
some
better
part
some
affinity
of
which
you
know
after
this
she
fell
into
silence
presently
lady
bellamy
raised
her
eyes
just
now
filled
up
with
the
great
pupils
and
fixed
them
on
mildred
are
thinking
she
said
slowly
angela
caresfoot
is
a
formidable
mildred
started
can
you
pretend
to
read
my
thoughts
she
laughed
a
little
am
an
adept
at
the
art
be
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
after
all
the
engagement
between
heigham
and
angela
caresfoot
should
come
to
nothing
of
course
i
speak
in
perfect
the
marriage
is
not
altogether
agreeable
to
the
father
who
would
prefer
another
and
more
suitable
match
but
unfortunately
there
is
no
way
of
shaking
the
young
i
think
that
with
assistance
a
way
might
be
their
eyes
met
and
this
time
mildred
took
up
the
parable
i
be
wrong
lady
bellamy
if
i
supposed
that
you
have
not
come
to
madeira
solely
for
pleasure
wise
person
always
tries
to
combine
business
and
in
this
case
the
business
combined
is
in
connection
with
engagement
supposing
that
i
were
to
tell
him
this
i
not
known
that
you
would
on
no
account
tell
heigham
i
should
not
have
told
how
do
you
know
that
will
answer
your
question
by
another
did
you
ever
yet
know
a
woman
who
loved
a
man
willingly
help
him
to
the
arms
of
a
rival
unless
indeed
she
was
forced
to
it
she
added
with
something
like
a
sigh
mildred
snowy
bosom
heaved
tumultuously
and
the
hue
faded
from
her
cheeks
mean
that
i
am
in
love
with
arthur
heigham
on
what
do
you
base
that
belief
a
base
as
broad
as
the
pyramids
of
which
you
were
talking
at
dinner
public
report
not
nearly
so
misleading
a
guide
as
people
think
your
face
your
voice
your
eyes
all
betray
you
why
do
you
always
try
to
get
near
him
to
touch
him
me
that
i
have
seen
you
do
it
three
times
this
evening
once
you
handed
him
a
book
in
order
to
touch
his
hand
beneath
it
but
there
is
no
need
to
enumerate
what
you
doubtless
very
well
remember
no
nice
woman
carr
ever
likes
to
continually
touch
a
man
unless
she
loves
him
you
are
always
listening
for
his
voice
and
step
you
are
listening
for
them
now
your
eyes
follow
his
face
as
a
dog
does
his
you
speak
to
him
your
voice
is
a
caress
in
itself
shall
i
go
on
think
that
it
is
unnecessary
whether
you
be
right
or
not
i
will
give
you
the
credit
of
being
a
close
observe
with
me
is
at
once
a
task
and
an
amusement
and
the
habit
is
one
that
leads
me
to
accurate
conclusions
as
i
think
you
will
admit
the
conclusion
i
have
come
to
in
your
case
is
that
you
do
not
wish
to
see
arthur
heigham
married
to
another
woman
i
spoke
just
now
of
have
none
to
give
i
will
give
none
how
could
i
look
him
in
the
face
are
strangely
scrupulous
for
a
woman
in
your
have
always
tried
to
behave
like
an
honourable
woman
lady
bellamy
and
i
do
not
feel
inclined
to
do
otherwise
you
will
think
differently
when
it
comes
to
the
point
but
in
the
meanwhile
remember
that
people
who
will
not
help
themselves
can
not
expect
to
be
and
for
all
lady
bellamy
understand
me
i
fight
for
my
own
hand
with
the
weapons
which
nature
and
fortune
have
given
me
and
by
myself
i
will
stand
or
fall
i
will
join
in
no
schemes
to
separate
arthur
from
this
woman
if
i
can
not
win
him
for
myself
by
myself
i
will
at
any
rate
lose
him
fairly
i
will
respect
what
you
have
told
me
but
i
will
do
no
lady
bellamy
smiled
as
she
really
admire
your
courage
it
is
quite
quixotic
hush
here
come
the
chapter
xlv
a
few
days
after
the
dinner
at
the
quinta
carr
the
visit
to
madeira
drew
to
a
close
on
the
evening
before
their
departure
arthur
volunteered
to
take
lady
bellamy
down
to
the
parade
to
hear
the
band
play
after
they
had
walked
about
a
while
under
the
shade
of
the
which
were
starred
all
over
with
creamy
cups
of
bloom
and
sufficiently
inspected
the
gay
throng
of
portuguese
inhabitants
and
english
visitors
made
gayer
still
by
the
amazingly
gorgeous
uniforms
of
the
officials
arthur
spied
two
chairs
in
a
comparatively
quiet
corner
and
suggested
that
they
should
sit
down
bellamy
he
said
after
hesitating
a
while
are
a
woman
of
the
world
and
i
believe
a
friend
of
my
own
i
want
to
ask
your
advice
about
is
entirely
at
your
service
really
it
is
very
i
turn
my
head
so
as
not
to
see
your
blushes
laugh
at
me
lady
bellamy
of
course
you
will
say
nothing
of
you
doubt
my
discretion
heigham
do
not
choose
me
as
a
confidante
you
are
going
unless
i
am
mistaken
to
speak
to
me
about
it
is
about
her
but
how
did
you
know
that
you
always
seem
to
be
able
to
read
thoughts
before
one
speaks
do
you
know
sometimes
i
think
that
she
has
taken
a
fancy
to
me
do
you
see
and
i
wanted
to
ask
you
what
you
thought
about
supposing
that
she
had
most
young
men
heigham
would
not
talk
of
such
a
thing
in
a
tone
befitting
a
great
catastrophe
but
if
i
am
not
entering
too
deeply
into
particulars
what
makes
you
think
so
really
i
exactly
know
she
sometimes
gives
me
a
general
then
there
has
been
nothing
yes
once
she
took
my
hand
or
i
took
hers
i
know
which
but
i
think
much
of
that
because
the
sort
of
thing
always
happening
you
know
and
nine
times
out
of
ten
means
nothing
at
all
but
why
i
ask
you
about
it
is
that
if
there
is
anything
of
the
sort
i
had
better
cut
and
run
out
of
this
because
it
would
not
be
fair
to
stop
either
to
her
or
to
angela
or
myself
it
would
be
dangerous
you
see
playing
with
such
a
woman
as
you
would
go
away
if
you
thought
that
she
took
any
warmer
interest
in
you
than
ladies
generally
do
in
men
engaged
to
be
i
then
i
think
that
i
can
set
your
mind
at
ease
i
have
observed
carr
pretty
closely
and
in
the
way
you
suppose
she
cares
for
you
no
more
than
she
does
for
your
coat
she
is
no
doubt
a
bit
of
a
flirt
and
very
likely
wishes
to
get
you
to
fall
in
love
with
natural
ambition
on
the
part
of
a
woman
but
as
for
being
in
love
with
you
herself
the
idea
is
absurd
women
of
the
world
do
not
fall
in
love
so
readily
they
are
too
much
taken
up
with
thinking
about
themselves
to
have
time
to
think
about
anybody
else
with
them
it
is
all
self
self
self
from
morning
till
night
besides
look
at
the
side
of
the
thing
do
you
suppose
it
likely
that
a
person
of
wealth
and
beauty
who
has
only
to
lift
her
hand
to
have
all
london
at
her
feet
is
likely
to
fix
her
affections
upon
a
young
man
whom
she
knows
is
already
engaged
to
be
married
and
forgive
me
if
i
say
not
got
the
same
recommendations
to
her
favour
that
many
of
her
suitors
have
it
is
of
course
quite
possible
that
society
may
be
dangerous
to
you
in
which
case
it
might
be
wise
for
you
to
go
but
i
really
do
not
think
that
you
need
feel
any
anxiety
on
her
account
she
finds
you
a
charming
companion
and
in
some
ways
a
useful
one
and
that
is
all
when
you
go
somebody
else
will
soon
fill
the
vacant
all
right
said
arthur
though
somehow
he
did
not
feel
as
wildly
delighted
as
he
should
have
done
at
hearing
it
so
clearly
demonstrated
that
mildred
did
not
care
a
brass
button
about
him
but
then
that
is
human
nature
between
eighteen
and
ninety
per
cent
of
the
men
in
the
world
would
like
to
centre
in
themselves
the
affections
of
every
young
and
pretty
woman
they
know
even
if
there
was
not
the
ghost
of
a
chance
of
their
marrying
one
of
them
the
same
tendency
is
to
be
observed
conversely
in
the
other
sex
only
in
their
case
with
a
still
smaller
proportion
of
exceptions
the
way
asked
arthur
presently
is
my
late
guardian
george
caresfoot
at
all
well
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
am
very
anxious
about
his
health
he
is
in
the
south
of
england
now
for
a
am
sorry
he
is
do
you
know
i
daresay
you
will
think
me
absurd
but
you
have
taken
a
weight
off
my
mind
i
always
had
an
idea
that
he
wanted
to
marry
angela
and
sometimes
i
am
afraid
that
i
have
suspected
that
philip
caresfoot
carted
me
off
in
order
to
give
him
a
chance
you
see
philip
is
uncommonly
fond
of
money
and
george
is
an
absurd
idea
heigham
why
george
looks
upon
matrimony
as
an
institution
of
the
evil
one
he
admires
angela
i
always
does
admire
a
pretty
face
but
as
for
dreaming
of
marrying
a
girl
half
his
age
and
his
own
cousin
into
the
bargain
it
is
about
the
last
thing
that
he
would
am
glad
to
hear
it
i
am
sure
i
have
been
uncomfortable
enough
thinking
about
him
sometimes
lady
bellamy
will
you
do
something
for
me
is
that
heigham
angela
all
about
would
that
be
quite
honourable
the
conditions
of
your
engagement
i
mean
never
promised
not
to
talk
about
me
i
only
promised
not
to
attempt
verbal
or
written
communication
with
i
will
tell
her
that
i
met
you
and
that
you
are
well
and
if
philip
will
allow
me
i
will
tell
her
more
but
of
course
i
know
if
he
will
or
not
what
ring
is
that
you
wear
is
one
that
angela
gave
me
when
we
became
engaged
it
was
her
you
let
me
look
at
it
arthur
held
out
his
hand
the
ring
was
an
antique
a
large
emerald
cut
like
a
seal
and
heavily
set
in
a
band
of
dull
gold
on
the
face
of
the
stone
were
engraved
some
mysterious
characters
is
that
engraved
on
the
stone
am
not
sure
but
angela
told
me
that
fraser
had
taken
an
impression
of
it
and
forwarded
it
to
a
great
oriental
scholar
his
friend
said
that
the
stone
must
be
extremely
ancient
as
the
character
is
a
form
of
sanscrit
and
that
he
believed
the
word
to
mean
or
angela
said
that
it
had
been
in
her
family
for
generations
and
was
supposed
to
have
been
brought
from
the
east
about
the
year
that
is
all
i
know
about
motto
is
better
suited
to
a
than
to
an
engagement
stone
said
lady
bellamy
with
one
of
her
dark
smiles
engagements
are
like
promises
and
made
to
be
hope
that
will
not
be
the
case
with
ours
however
said
arthur
attempting
a
laugh
hope
not
i
am
sure
but
never
pin
your
faith
absolutely
to
any
woman
or
you
will
regret
it
always
accept
her
oaths
and
protestations
as
you
would
a
political
statement
politely
and
with
an
appearance
of
perfect
faith
but
with
a
certain
grain
of
mistrust
fidelity
is
in
the
main
a
fiction
we
are
faithful
just
as
men
are
so
long
as
it
suits
us
to
be
so
with
this
difference
however
men
play
false
from
passion
or
impulse
women
from
do
not
draw
a
pleasing
picture
of
your
own
is
the
truth
pleasing
it
is
only
when
we
clothe
its
nakedness
with
the
rags
of
imagination
or
sweeten
it
with
fiction
that
it
can
please
of
itself
it
is
so
ugly
a
thing
that
society
in
its
refinement
will
not
even
hear
it
but
prefers
to
employ
a
corresponding
formula
thus
all
passion
however
vile
is
called
by
the
name
of
all
superstitious
terror
and
grovelling
attempts
to
conciliate
the
unseen
are
known
as
while
selfish
greed
and
the
hungry
lust
for
power
masquerade
as
laudable
men
and
women
especially
women
hate
the
truth
because
like
the
electric
light
it
shows
them
as
they
are
and
that
is
vile
it
has
grown
so
strange
to
them
from
disuse
that
like
pilate
they
do
not
even
know
what
it
is
i
was
going
to
say
however
that
if
you
care
to
trust
me
with
it
i
think
i
see
how
i
can
take
a
message
to
angela
for
either
causing
you
to
break
your
promise
or
doing
anything
dishonourable
if
you
like
i
will
take
her
that
ring
i
think
that
is
a
very
generous
offer
on
my
part
for
i
do
not
like
the
what
is
the
use
of
taking
her
the
ring
is
something
that
there
can
be
no
mistake
about
that
is
all
a
speaking
message
from
yourself
but
give
it
me
if
you
do
not
like
perhaps
you
had
rather
not
like
parting
with
it
at
all
i
confess
but
i
should
dearly
like
to
send
her
something
i
suppose
that
you
would
not
take
a
letter
would
not
write
one
heigham
of
course
i
forget
that
accursed
promise
here
take
the
ring
and
say
all
you
can
to
angela
with
it
you
promise
that
you
will
i
promise
that
i
will
say
all
i
are
very
good
and
kind
i
wish
to
heaven
that
i
were
going
to
marlshire
with
you
if
you
only
knew
how
i
long
to
see
her
again
i
think
that
it
would
break
my
heart
if
anything
happened
to
separate
us
and
his
lips
quivered
at
the
thought
lady
bellamy
turned
her
sombre
face
upon
was
compassion
in
her
eyes
you
bear
angela
caresfoot
so
great
a
love
be
guided
by
me
and
shake
it
off
strangle
rid
of
it
anyhow
for
fulfilled
affection
of
that
nature
would
carry
a
larger
happiness
with
it
than
is
allowed
in
a
world
planned
expressly
to
secure
the
greatest
misery
of
the
greatest
number
there
is
a
fate
which
fights
against
it
its
ministers
are
human
folly
and
passion
you
have
seen
many
marriages
tell
me
how
many
have
you
known
out
of
a
novel
where
the
people
married
their
true
loves
in
novels
they
always
do
it
is
another
of
pleasant
fictions
but
real
life
is
like
a
novel
without
the
third
volume
i
do
not
want
to
alarm
you
heigham
but
because
i
like
you
i
ask
you
to
steel
your
mind
to
disappointment
so
that
if
a
blow
comes
it
may
not
crush
do
you
mean
lady
bellamy
do
you
know
of
any
impending
trouble
certainly
not
i
only
talk
on
general
principles
do
not
be
confident
and
trust
a
woman
come
let
us
get
next
morning
when
arthur
came
down
to
breakfast
the
bellamys
had
sailed
the
mail
had
come
in
from
the
cape
at
midnight
and
left
again
at
dawn
taking
them
with
it
chapter
xlvi
the
departure
of
the
bellamys
left
arthur
in
very
low
spirits
his
sensations
were
similar
to
those
which
one
can
well
imagine
an
ancient
greek
might
have
experienced
who
having
sent
to
consult
the
delphic
oracle
had
got
for
his
pains
a
very
unsatisfactory
reply
foreshadowing
evils
but
not
actually
defining
them
lady
bellamy
was
in
some
way
connected
with
the
idea
of
an
oracle
in
his
mind
she
looked
oracular
her
dark
face
and
inscrutable
eyes
the
stamp
of
power
upon
her
brow
all
suggested
that
she
was
a
mistress
of
the
black
arts
her
words
too
were
mysterious
and
fraught
with
bitter
wisdom
and
a
deep
knowledge
distilled
from
the
poisonous
weeds
of
life
arthur
felt
with
something
like
a
shudder
that
if
lady
bellamy
prophesied
evil
evil
was
following
hard
upon
her
words
and
in
warning
him
not
to
place
his
whole
happiness
upon
one
venture
lest
it
should
meet
with
shipwreck
he
was
sure
that
she
was
prophesying
with
a
knowledge
of
the
future
denied
to
ordinary
mortals
how
earnestly
too
she
had
cautioned
him
against
putting
absolute
faith
in
earnestly
indeed
that
her
talk
had
left
a
flavour
of
distrust
in
his
mind
yet
how
could
he
mistrust
angela
nor
was
he
comforted
by
a
remark
that
fell
from
mildred
carr
the
afternoon
following
the
departure
of
the
mail
raising
her
eyes
she
glanced
at
his
hand
are
you
looking
at
he
said
not
that
queer
emerald
you
wore
your
engagement
ring
have
you
done
with
it
gave
it
to
lady
bellamy
to
give
to
for
show
her
that
i
am
alive
and
well
i
may
not
write
you
are
very
do
you
mean
at
least
i
mean
that
i
think
that
i
should
care
to
hand
over
my
engagement
ring
so
easily
it
might
be
misapplied
you
this
view
of
the
matter
helped
to
fill
up
the
cup
of
nervous
anxiety
and
he
vainly
plied
mildred
with
questions
to
get
her
to
elucidate
her
meaning
and
state
her
causes
of
suspicion
if
she
had
any
but
she
would
say
nothing
more
on
the
subject
which
then
dropped
and
was
not
alluded
to
again
between
them
after
the
departure
the
time
wore
on
at
madeira
without
bringing
about
any
appreciable
change
in
the
situation
but
mildred
saw
that
their
visit
had
robbed
her
of
any
advantages
she
had
gained
over
arthur
for
they
had
as
it
were
brought
atmosphere
with
them
and
faint
though
it
was
it
sufficed
to
overpower
her
influence
he
made
no
move
forward
and
seemed
to
have
entirely
forgotten
the
episode
on
the
hills
when
he
had
gone
so
very
near
disaster
on
the
contrary
he
appeared
to
her
to
grow
increasingly
preoccupied
as
time
went
on
and
to
look
upon
her
more
and
more
in
the
light
of
a
sister
till
at
length
her
patience
wore
thin
as
for
her
passion
it
grew
almost
unrestrainable
in
its
confinement
now
she
drifted
like
a
rudderless
vessel
on
a
sea
which
raged
continuously
and
knew
no
space
of
calm
and
so
little
oil
was
poured
upon
the
troubled
waters
there
were
so
few
breaks
in
the
that
rose
black
between
her
and
the
desired
haven
of
her
rest
indeed
she
began
to
doubt
if
even
her
poor
power
of
charming
him
as
at
first
she
had
been
able
to
do
with
the
sparkle
of
her
wit
and
the
unconscious
display
of
her
natural
grace
was
not
on
the
wane
and
if
she
was
not
near
to
losing
her
precarious
foothold
in
his
esteem
and
affection
the
thought
that
he
might
be
tiring
of
her
struck
her
like
a
freezing
wind
and
for
a
moment
turned
her
heart
to
ice
poor
mildred
higher
than
ever
above
her
head
bloomed
that
she
longed
to
pluck
would
she
ever
reach
it
after
all
her
striving
even
to
gather
one
poor
leaf
one
withered
petal
the
path
which
led
to
it
was
very
hard
to
climb
and
below
the
breakers
boiled
would
it
after
all
be
her
fate
to
fall
down
into
that
gulf
of
which
the
sorrowful
waters
could
bring
neither
death
nor
forgetfulness
and
so
christmas
came
and
went
one
day
when
they
were
all
sitting
in
the
some
eight
weeks
after
the
bellamys
had
left
and
mildred
was
letting
her
mind
run
on
such
thoughts
as
these
arthur
who
had
been
reading
a
novel
got
up
and
opened
the
at
the
end
of
the
room
which
separated
it
from
the
second
and
also
the
further
doors
between
that
room
and
the
then
he
returned
and
standing
at
the
top
of
the
big
took
a
view
of
the
whole
suite
you
doing
arthur
am
reflecting
mildred
that
with
such
a
suite
of
apartments
at
your
command
it
is
a
sin
and
a
shame
not
to
give
a
will
give
a
ball
if
you
like
arthur
will
you
dance
with
me
if
i
do
many
times
he
said
laughing
i
will
be
times
let
me
first
waltz
the
waltz
before
supper
and
the
last
will
dance
me
off
my
head
it
is
dangerous
to
waltz
with
any
one
so
pretty
he
said
in
that
bantering
tone
he
often
took
with
her
and
which
aggravated
her
intensely
is
more
likely
that
my
own
head
will
suffer
as
i
dance
so
rarely
then
that
is
a
bargain
me
mildred
how
silly
you
are
you
are
like
a
schoolgirl
said
miss
terry
is
put
out
because
you
do
not
offer
to
dance
three
times
with
but
i
will
though
if
she
likes
three
and
so
the
matter
passed
off
in
mutual
badinage
but
mildred
did
not
forget
her
intention
on
the
contrary
at
madeira
was
soon
profoundly
agitated
by
the
intelligence
that
the
lady
croesus
carr
was
about
to
give
a
magnificent
ball
and
so
rather
so
given
to
jumping
to
society
that
it
was
freely
said
it
was
in
order
to
celebrate
her
engagement
to
arthur
heigham
arthur
heard
nothing
of
this
one
is
always
the
last
to
hear
things
about
oneself
mildred
knew
of
it
however
but
whether
from
indifference
or
from
some
hidden
motive
she
neither
took
any
steps
to
contradict
it
herself
nor
would
she
allow
miss
terry
to
do
so
she
said
them
talk
to
contradict
such
things
only
makes
people
believe
them
the
more
mind
now
agatha
not
a
word
of
this
to
heigham
it
would
put
him
mildred
i
should
have
thought
that
you
would
be
put
out
no
worse
things
might
happen
and
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
at
length
the
evening
came
and
the
arriving
guests
found
that
the
ball
had
been
planned
on
a
scale
such
as
madeira
had
never
before
beheld
the
night
was
lovely
and
sufficiently
still
to
admit
of
the
illumination
of
the
gardens
by
means
of
chinese
lanterns
that
glowed
all
around
in
hundreds
and
were
even
hung
like
golden
fruit
amongst
the
topmost
leaves
of
the
lofty
cabbage
palms
and
from
the
tallest
sprays
of
the
bamboos
within
the
scene
was
equally
beautiful
the
suite
of
three
had
been
thrown
into
one
two
for
dancing
and
one
for
use
as
a
they
were
quite
full
for
the
madeira
season
was
at
its
height
and
all
the
english
visitors
who
were
were
there
there
happened
too
to
be
a
in
the
harbour
every
or
rather
every
of
which
with
the
exception
of
those
on
they
were
to
be
relieved
later
there
and
prepared
to
enjoy
himself
with
a
gusto
characteristic
of
the
british
the
rooms
too
were
by
no
means
devoid
of
beauty
but
by
far
the
loveliest
woman
in
them
was
carr
herself
she
was
simply
dressed
in
a
black
satin
gown
looped
up
with
diamond
stars
that
showed
off
the
exquisite
fairness
of
her
skin
to
great
perfection
her
ornaments
were
also
diamonds
but
such
little
flowers
and
birds
constructed
of
tiny
stones
but
large
single
gems
each
the
size
of
a
on
her
head
she
wore
a
tiara
of
these
eleven
stones
in
all
five
on
each
side
and
surmounted
over
the
centre
of
the
forehead
by
an
enormous
gem
as
large
as
a
small
walnut
which
standing
by
itself
above
the
level
of
the
others
flashed
and
blazed
like
a
fairy
star
around
her
neck
wrists
and
waist
were
similar
points
of
concentrated
light
that
shining
against
the
black
satin
as
she
moved
gave
her
a
truly
magnificent
appearance
never
before
had
mildred
carr
looked
so
perfectly
lovely
for
her
face
and
form
were
well
worthy
of
the
gems
and
dress
indeed
most
of
the
men
there
that
night
thought
her
eyes
as
beautiful
as
her
diamonds
the
ball
opened
with
a
quadrille
but
in
this
carr
did
not
dance
being
employed
in
the
reception
of
her
guests
then
followed
a
waltz
and
as
its
first
strains
struck
up
several
applicants
came
to
compete
for
the
honour
of
her
hand
but
she
declined
them
all
saying
that
she
was
already
engaged
and
presently
arthur
looking
very
tall
and
quite
the
typical
young
englishman
in
his
came
hurrying
up
are
late
heigham
she
said
music
has
i
am
awfully
sorry
i
was
dancing
with
lady
florence
and
could
not
find
her
old
to
me
velley
is
pretty
conspicuous
with
that
green
thing
on
her
head
but
come
along
we
are
wasting
putting
his
arm
round
her
waist
they
sailed
away
together
amidst
of
the
murmurs
of
the
disappointed
applicants
dog
said
one
puppy
muttered
another
arthur
enjoyed
his
waltz
very
much
for
the
rooms
though
full
were
not
crowded
and
mildred
waltzed
well
still
he
was
a
little
uneasy
for
he
felt
that
in
being
chosen
to
dance
the
first
waltz
with
the
giver
of
this
splendid
entertainment
over
the
heads
of
so
many
of
his
superiors
in
rank
and
position
he
was
being
put
rather
out
of
his
place
he
did
not
as
a
rule
take
any
great
degree
of
notice
of
appearance
but
it
struck
him
as
unusually
charming
look
very
beautiful
mildred
he
said
when
they
halted
for
breath
what
splendid
diamonds
you
have
on
she
flushed
with
pleasure
at
his
compliment
must
not
laugh
at
my
diamonds
i
know
that
i
am
too
insignificant
to
wear
such
jewels
i
had
two
minds
about
putting
them
at
them
indeed
i
should
as
soon
think
of
laughing
at
the
bank
of
england
they
are
she
said
bitterly
would
be
splendid
on
your
angela
they
want
a
splendid
woman
to
carry
them
oddly
enough
he
was
thinking
the
same
thing
so
having
nothing
to
say
he
went
on
dancing
presently
the
waltz
came
to
an
end
and
mildred
was
obliged
to
hurry
off
to
receive
the
portuguese
governor
who
had
just
put
in
an
appearance
arthur
looked
at
his
card
and
found
that
he
was
down
for
the
next
galop
with
lady
florence
claverley
dance
again
lady
heigham
this
is
quite
shocking
if
everybody
did
not
know
that
you
belonged
body
and
soul
to
the
lovely
widow
i
should
be
accused
of
flirting
with
was
it
made
me
promise
to
dance
five
times
did
i
want
to
make
carr
should
my
dancing
five
or
fifty
dances
with
you
make
carr
angry
lady
florence
shrugged
her
pretty
shoulders
you
blind
she
said
arthur
felt
uncomfortable
in
due
course
however
the
last
waltz
before
supper
came
round
and
he
as
agreed
upon
danced
it
with
his
hostess
as
the
strains
of
the
music
died
away
the
doors
of
the
and
tent
were
thrown
open
arthur
said
mildred
me
in
to
he
hesitated
portuguese
he
began
she
stamped
her
little
foot
and
her
eyes
gave
an
ominous
flash
i
ask
you
twice
she
said
then
he
yielded
though
the
fact
of
being
for
the
second
time
that
night
placed
in
an
unnecessarily
prominent
position
made
him
feel
more
uncomfortable
than
ever
for
they
were
seated
at
the
head
of
the
top
table
mildred
carr
was
in
the
exact
centre
with
himself
on
her
right
and
the
portuguese
governor
on
the
left
to
left
was
lady
florence
who
took
an
opportunity
to
assure
him
solemnly
that
he
really
his
blushing
honours
very
nicely
and
to
ask
him
he
liked
the
high
places
at
feasts
the
supper
passed
off
as
brilliantly
as
most
successful
suppers
do
carr
looked
charming
and
her
conversation
sparkled
like
her
own
champagne
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
as
in
the
case
of
the
wine
there
was
too
much
sting
in
it
the
wine
was
a
little
too
dry
and
her
talk
a
little
too
full
of
suppressed
sarcasm
though
he
could
not
quite
tell
what
it
was
aimed
at
any
more
than
he
could
trace
the
source
of
the
champagne
bubbles
supper
done
he
led
her
back
to
the
the
second
extra
was
just
beginning
and
she
stood
as
though
she
were
expecting
him
to
ask
her
to
dance
it
am
sorry
mildred
but
i
must
go
now
i
am
engaged
this
to
this
was
very
coldly
said
florence
he
answered
confusedly
though
there
really
was
no
reason
why
he
should
be
ashamed
she
looked
at
him
steadily
i
forgot
for
you
are
her
monopoly
a
little
while
after
this
arthur
thought
that
he
had
had
about
enough
dancing
for
awhile
and
went
and
sat
by
himself
in
a
secluded
spot
under
the
shadow
of
a
in
a
temporary
conservatory
put
up
outside
a
the
chinese
lantern
that
hung
upon
the
fern
had
gone
out
leaving
his
chair
in
total
darkness
presently
a
couple
whom
he
did
not
recognize
for
he
only
saw
their
backs
strayed
in
and
placed
themselves
on
a
bench
before
him
in
such
a
way
as
to
entirely
cut
off
his
retreat
he
was
making
up
his
mind
to
disturb
them
when
they
began
a
conversation
in
which
the
squeezing
of
hands
and
mild
terms
of
endearment
played
a
part
fearing
to
interrupt
lest
he
should
disturb
their
equanimity
he
judged
it
best
to
stop
where
he
was
presently
however
their
talk
took
a
turn
that
proved
intensely
interesting
to
him
it
was
something
as
follows
you
seen
the
hero
of
the
evening
do
you
mean
the
portuguese
governor
in
his
of
course
not
you
call
him
a
hero
do
you
i
mean
our
the
young
fellow
who
took
her
in
to
yes
i
did
not
think
much
of
him
lucky
dog
but
he
must
be
rather
mean
they
say
that
he
is
engaged
to
a
girl
in
england
and
has
thrown
her
over
for
the
jealous
i
know
that
you
would
like
to
be
in
his
shoes
come
are
very
unkind
why
should
i
be
jealous
you
need
not
hurt
my
hand
and
will
you
remember
that
black
shows
against
white
awfully
hot
here
go
into
the
chapter
xlvii
arthur
emerged
from
his
at
hearing
what
was
being
said
about
him
and
wondering
so
far
as
he
was
at
the
moment
capable
of
accurate
thought
how
long
this
report
had
been
going
about
and
whether
by
any
chance
it
had
reached
the
ears
of
the
bellamys
if
it
had
the
mischief
might
be
very
serious
in
the
confusion
of
his
mind
only
two
things
were
clear
to
was
that
both
for
and
his
own
sake
he
must
leave
madeira
at
once
and
secondly
that
he
would
dance
no
more
with
her
that
night
meanwhile
the
ball
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
presently
he
heard
the
strains
of
the
last
galop
strike
up
after
the
band
had
been
playing
for
a
minute
or
two
a
natural
curiosity
drew
him
to
the
door
of
the
to
see
if
mildred
was
dancing
with
anybody
else
here
he
found
lady
florence
looking
rather
disconsolate
is
it
that
you
are
not
dancing
she
asked
he
murmured
something
inaudible
about
we
are
in
the
same
box
what
do
you
think
i
promised
this
galop
to
captain
clemence
and
now
there
he
is
vainly
trying
to
persuade
carr
who
look
at
him
and
appears
to
be
waiting
for
somebody
i
should
give
him
the
dance
i
will
be
even
with
him
just
then
the
music
reached
a
peculiarly
seductive
passage
come
along
said
lady
florence
quite
regardless
of
the
proprieties
and
before
arthur
well
knew
where
he
was
he
was
whirling
round
the
room
carr
was
standing
at
the
top
corner
where
the
crush
obliged
him
to
slacken
his
pace
and
as
he
did
so
he
caught
her
eye
she
was
talking
to
lady
faithless
partner
with
a
smile
upon
her
lips
but
one
glance
at
her
face
sufficed
to
tell
him
that
she
was
in
a
royal
rage
and
what
was
more
with
himself
his
partner
noticed
it
too
and
was
amused
i
am
mistaken
heigham
you
have
come
into
trouble
look
at
and
she
laughed
but
that
was
not
all
either
from
sheer
mischief
or
from
curiosity
to
see
what
would
happen
she
insisted
upon
stopping
as
the
dance
drew
to
a
close
by
corner
that
lady
however
proved
herself
equal
to
the
occasion
heigham
she
said
sweetly
you
know
that
that
was
our
dance
was
it
he
replied
feeling
very
much
a
fool
certainly
it
was
but
with
such
a
temptation
to
she
smiled
towards
lady
is
not
wonderful
that
you
made
a
mistake
and
as
you
look
so
contrite
you
shall
be
forgiven
agatha
a
dear
just
ask
that
man
to
go
up
to
the
band
and
tell
them
to
play
another
waltz
berceuse
before
save
the
arthur
felt
all
the
while
though
she
was
talking
so
suavely
that
she
was
in
a
state
of
suppressed
rage
once
he
glanced
at
her
and
saw
that
her
eyes
seemed
to
flash
but
her
anger
only
made
her
look
more
lovely
supplying
as
it
did
an
added
dignity
and
charm
to
her
sweet
features
nor
did
she
allow
it
to
have
full
play
mildred
felt
that
the
crisis
in
her
fortunes
was
far
too
serious
to
admit
of
being
trifled
with
she
knew
how
unlikely
it
was
that
she
would
ever
have
a
better
chance
with
arthur
than
she
had
now
for
the
mirrors
told
her
that
she
was
looking
her
loveliest
which
was
very
lovely
indeed
in
addition
she
was
surrounded
by
every
seductive
circumstance
that
could
assist
to
compel
a
young
man
however
much
engaged
to
commit
himself
by
some
act
or
words
of
folly
the
sound
and
sights
of
beauty
the
rich
odour
of
flowers
the
voluptuous
swell
and
last
but
not
least
the
pressure
of
her
gracious
form
and
the
glances
from
her
eyes
which
alone
were
enough
to
make
fools
of
out
of
every
hundred
young
men
in
europe
these
things
combined
to
help
her
and
to
them
must
be
added
her
determination
that
concentrated
strength
of
will
employed
to
a
single
end
which
if
there
be
any
truth
in
the
theories
of
the
action
of
mind
on
mind
can
not
fail
to
influence
the
individual
on
whom
it
is
directed
the
room
was
very
nearly
clear
for
it
was
drawing
towards
daylight
when
they
floated
away
together
oh
what
a
waltz
that
was
the
incarnate
spirit
of
the
dance
took
possession
of
them
she
waltzed
divinely
and
there
was
scarcely
anything
to
check
their
progress
on
on
they
sped
with
flying
feet
as
the
music
rose
and
fell
above
them
and
soon
things
began
to
change
for
arthur
all
sense
of
embarrassment
and
regret
vanished
from
his
mind
which
now
appeared
to
be
capable
of
holding
but
one
idea
of
the
simplest
and
yet
the
most
soaring
nature
he
thought
that
he
was
in
heaven
with
mildred
carr
on
still
on
now
he
saw
nothing
but
her
face
and
the
large
flash
of
the
circling
diamonds
felt
nothing
but
the
pressure
of
her
form
and
her
odorous
breath
upon
his
cheek
heard
nothing
but
the
soft
sound
of
her
breathing
closer
he
clasped
her
there
was
no
sense
of
weariness
in
his
feet
or
oppression
in
his
lungs
he
could
have
danced
for
ever
but
all
too
soon
the
music
ceased
with
a
crash
and
they
were
standing
with
quick
breath
and
sparkling
eyes
by
the
spot
that
they
had
started
from
close
by
miss
terry
was
sitting
yawning
say
to
those
people
for
me
i
must
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
give
me
a
glass
of
water
please
he
did
so
and
by
way
of
composing
his
own
nerves
took
a
tumbler
of
champagne
he
had
no
longer
any
thought
of
anxiety
or
danger
and
he
too
longed
for
air
they
passed
out
into
the
garden
and
by
a
common
consent
made
their
way
to
the
museum
verandah
which
was
as
it
proved
quite
deserted
the
night
which
was
drawing
to
its
close
was
perfect
far
over
the
west
the
setting
moon
was
sinking
into
the
silver
ocean
whilst
the
first
primrose
hue
of
dawn
was
creeping
up
the
eastern
sky
it
was
essentially
a
dangerous
night
especially
after
dancing
and
champagne
night
to
make
people
do
and
say
regrettable
things
for
as
one
of
the
it
not
byron
profoundly
remarked
there
is
the
very
devil
in
the
moon
at
times
they
stood
and
gazed
awhile
at
the
softness
of
its
setting
splendours
and
listened
to
the
sounds
of
the
last
departing
guests
fading
into
silence
and
to
the
murmurs
of
the
quiet
sea
at
last
she
spoke
very
low
and
musically
was
angry
with
you
i
brought
you
here
to
scold
you
but
on
such
a
night
i
can
not
find
the
did
you
want
to
scold
me
about
mind
it
is
all
forgotten
look
at
that
setting
moon
and
the
silver
clouds
above
her
and
she
dropped
her
hand
from
which
she
had
slipped
the
glove
upon
his
own
now
look
at
me
and
tell
me
how
i
look
and
how
you
liked
the
ball
i
gave
it
to
please
look
very
lovely
dangerously
lovely
and
the
ball
was
splendid
let
us
you
think
me
lovely
arthur
who
could
help
it
but
let
us
go
awhile
arthur
do
not
leave
me
yet
tell
me
is
not
this
necklace
undone
fasten
it
for
me
he
turned
to
obey
but
his
hand
shook
too
much
to
allow
him
to
do
so
her
eyes
shone
into
his
own
her
fragrant
breath
played
upon
his
brow
and
her
bosom
heaved
beneath
his
shaking
hand
she
too
was
moved
light
tremors
ran
along
her
limbs
the
colour
came
and
went
upon
her
neck
and
brow
and
a
dreamy
look
had
gathered
in
her
tender
eyes
beneath
them
the
sea
made
its
gentle
music
and
above
the
wind
was
whispering
to
the
trees
presently
his
hand
dropped
and
he
stood
fascinated
can
not
what
makes
you
look
like
that
you
are
bewitching
next
moment
he
heard
a
sigh
the
next
sweet
lips
were
upon
his
own
and
she
was
in
his
arms
she
lay
there
still
quite
still
but
even
as
she
lay
there
rose
as
it
were
in
the
midst
of
the
glamour
and
confusion
of
his
mind
that
made
him
see
all
things
distraught
and
seemed
to
blot
out
every
principle
of
right
and
honour
another
and
far
different
scene
for
as
in
a
vision
he
saw
a
dim
english
landscape
and
a
grey
ruin
and
himself
within
its
shadows
with
a
nobler
woman
in
his
arms
me
said
a
remembered
voice
me
and
i
will
still
thank
you
for
this
hour
of
imperial
the
glamour
was
gone
the
confusion
made
straight
and
clear
above
him
shone
the
light
of
duty
dear
mildred
this
can
not
be
sit
down
i
want
to
speak
to
she
turned
quite
white
and
sank
from
his
arms
without
a
word
you
know
that
i
am
the
lips
moved
but
no
sound
issued
from
them
again
she
tried
why
do
you
tempt
me
i
am
only
a
man
and
weak
as
water
in
your
presence
do
not
make
me
dishonourable
to
myself
and
love
you
as
well
as
she
the
shameful
me
if
i
pain
you
for
i
must
i
must
i
love
the
beautiful
face
hid
itself
in
the
ungloved
hands
no
answer
came
only
the
great
diamond
sparkled
and
blazed
in
the
soft
light
like
a
hard
and
cruel
eye
not
mildred
for
sake
involve
us
all
in
shame
and
ruin
but
let
us
part
now
if
i
could
have
foreseen
how
this
would
end
but
i
have
been
a
blind
and
selfish
fool
i
have
been
to
she
was
quite
calm
now
and
spoke
in
her
usual
singularly
clear
voice
dear
i
do
not
blame
you
loving
how
was
it
likely
that
you
should
think
of
love
from
i
only
blame
myself
i
have
loved
you
god
help
me
ever
since
we
you
with
a
despairing
desperate
love
such
as
i
hope
that
you
may
never
know
was
i
to
allow
your
phantom
angela
to
snatch
the
cup
from
my
lips
without
a
struggle
the
only
happy
cup
i
ever
knew
for
arthur
at
the
best
of
times
i
have
not
been
a
happy
woman
i
have
always
wanted
love
and
it
has
not
come
to
me
perhaps
i
should
be
but
i
am
high
ideal
being
i
am
as
nature
made
me
arthur
a
poor
creature
unable
to
stand
alone
against
such
a
current
as
has
lately
swept
me
with
it
but
you
are
quite
right
you
must
leave
me
we
separate
you
go
but
oh
god
when
i
think
of
the
future
the
hard
loveless
she
paused
awhile
and
then
went
did
not
think
to
harm
you
or
involve
you
in
trouble
though
i
hoped
to
win
some
small
portion
of
your
love
and
i
had
something
to
give
you
in
exchange
if
beauty
and
great
wealth
are
really
worth
anything
but
you
must
go
dear
now
whilst
i
am
brave
i
hope
that
you
will
be
happy
with
your
angela
when
i
see
your
marriage
in
the
paper
i
shall
send
her
this
tiara
as
a
wedding
present
i
shall
never
wear
it
again
go
dear
go
he
turned
to
leave
not
trusting
himself
to
speak
for
the
big
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
and
his
throat
was
choked
when
he
had
reached
the
steps
she
called
him
back
me
once
before
you
go
and
i
see
your
dear
face
no
more
i
used
to
be
a
proud
woman
and
to
think
that
i
can
stoop
to
rob
a
kiss
from
angela
thank
you
you
are
very
kind
and
now
one
word
you
know
a
woman
always
loves
a
last
word
sometimes
it
happens
that
we
put
up
idols
and
a
stronger
hand
than
ours
shatters
them
to
dust
before
our
eyes
i
trust
this
may
not
be
your
lot
i
love
you
so
well
that
i
can
say
that
honestly
but
arthur
if
it
should
be
remember
that
in
all
the
changes
of
this
cold
world
there
is
one
heart
which
will
never
forget
you
and
never
set
up
a
rival
to
your
memory
one
place
where
you
will
always
find
a
home
if
anything
should
ever
happen
to
break
your
life
come
back
to
me
for
comfort
arthur
i
can
talk
no
more
i
have
played
for
high
lost
he
went
without
a
word
chapter
xlviii
reader
have
you
ever
in
the
winter
or
early
spring
come
from
a
house
where
you
have
admired
some
rich
tropical
bloom
and
then
in
walking
by
the
hedgerows
suddenly
seen
a
pure
primrose
opening
its
sweet
eye
and
looking
bravely
into
bitter
face
if
so
you
will
if
it
is
your
habit
to
notice
flowers
have
experienced
some
such
sensation
as
takes
possession
of
my
mind
when
i
pass
from
the
story
of
mildred
as
she
was
then
and
loving
to
angela
as
loving
indeed
and
yet
more
anxious
but
as
a
child
and
not
doubtful
for
the
end
they
were
both
flowers
indeed
and
both
beautiful
but
between
them
there
was
a
wide
difference
the
one
in
the
richness
of
her
splendour
gazed
upon
the
close
place
where
she
queened
it
and
was
satisfied
with
the
beauty
round
her
or
if
not
satisfied
she
could
imagine
none
different
the
limits
of
that
little
spot
formed
the
horizon
of
her
knew
no
world
beyond
the
other
full
of
possibilities
shed
sweetness
even
on
the
blast
which
cut
her
and
looked
up
for
shelter
towards
the
blue
sky
she
knew
endured
eternally
above
the
driving
clouds
whilst
sir
john
health
was
being
recruited
at
madeira
daily
life
pursued
an
even
and
comparatively
speaking
a
happy
course
she
missed
pigott
much
but
then
she
often
went
to
see
her
and
by
way
of
compensation
if
she
had
gone
so
had
george
caresfoot
and
lady
bellamy
fraser
too
had
come
back
to
fill
a
space
in
the
void
of
her
loneliness
and
for
his
presence
she
was
very
grateful
indeed
none
but
herself
could
know
the
comfort
and
strength
she
gathered
from
his
friendship
none
but
himself
could
know
what
it
cost
him
to
comfort
her
but
he
did
not
shrink
from
the
duty
indeed
it
gave
him
a
melancholy
satisfaction
he
loved
her
quite
as
dearly
and
with
as
deep
a
longing
as
mildred
carr
did
arthur
but
how
different
were
his
ends
of
ultimately
supplanting
his
rival
he
never
dreamt
his
aim
was
to
assist
him
to
bring
the
full
cup
of
joy
untainted
to
his
lips
and
so
he
read
with
her
and
talked
with
her
and
was
sick
at
heart
and
she
thanked
him
and
consecrating
all
her
most
sacred
thoughts
to
the
memory
of
her
absent
lover
and
all
her
quick
energies
to
for
his
coming
possessed
her
soul
in
patience
and
thus
her
young
life
began
to
bloom
again
with
a
fresh
promise
the
close
of
each
departing
day
was
the
signal
for
the
lifting
of
a
portion
of
her
load
for
it
brought
her
a
day
nearer
to
her
arms
subtracting
something
from
the
long
tale
of
barren
hours
since
to
her
all
hours
seemed
most
barren
that
were
not
quickened
by
his
presence
indeed
no
arctic
winter
could
be
colder
and
more
devoid
of
light
and
life
than
this
time
of
absence
was
to
her
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
warm
splendour
of
her
hopes
shooting
its
beautiful
promise
in
unreal
gleams
across
the
blackness
of
her
horizon
she
felt
as
though
she
must
have
frozen
and
died
for
hope
elusive
as
she
is
often
bears
a
fairer
outward
mien
than
the
realization
to
which
she
points
and
like
a
fond
deceiver
serves
to
keep
the
heart
alive
till
the
first
bitterness
is
overpast
and
schooled
in
trouble
it
can
know
her
false
and
yet
remain
unbroken
but
sometimes
mood
would
change
and
then
to
her
strained
and
sensitive
mind
this
dead
calm
and
cessation
of
events
would
seem
to
resemble
that
ominous
moment
when
in
tropic
seas
the
fierce
outrider
of
the
tempest
has
passed
howling
away
clothed
in
flying
foam
then
comes
a
calm
and
for
a
space
there
is
blue
sky
and
the
sails
flap
drearily
against
the
mast
and
the
vessel
only
rocks
from
the
violence
of
her
past
plunging
while
the
scream
of
the
is
heard
with
unnatural
clearness
for
there
is
no
sound
nor
motion
in
the
air
intenser
still
grows
the
silence
and
the
waters
almost
cease
from
tossing
but
the
seaman
knows
that
presently
with
a
sudden
roar
the
armies
of
the
winds
and
waves
will
leap
upon
him
and
that
a
struggle
for
life
is
at
hand
such
fears
however
did
not
often
take
her
for
unlike
arthur
she
was
naturally
of
a
hopeful
mind
and
when
they
did
fraser
would
find
means
to
comfort
her
but
this
was
soon
to
change
one
was
christmas
went
down
the
village
to
see
pigott
now
comfortably
established
in
the
house
her
long
departed
husband
had
left
her
it
was
a
miserable
december
day
a
damp
unpleasant
ghost
of
a
day
and
all
the
sky
was
packed
with
clouds
while
the
surface
of
the
earth
was
wrapped
in
mist
rain
and
snow
fell
noiselessly
by
turns
indeed
the
only
sound
in
the
air
was
the
loud
dripping
of
water
from
the
trees
on
the
dead
leaves
beneath
the
whole
outlook
was
melancholy
in
the
extreme
while
angela
was
in
her
old
cottage
the
snow
fell
in
earnest
for
an
hour
or
so
and
then
held
up
again
and
when
she
came
out
the
mist
had
recovered
its
supremacy
and
now
the
snow
was
melting
miss
you
must
be
getting
home
or
it
will
be
dark
shall
i
come
with
you
a
bit
thank
you
pigott
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
dark
and
i
ought
to
know
my
way
about
these
parts
the
prevailing
dismalness
of
the
scene
oppressed
her
and
she
made
up
her
mind
to
go
and
see
fraser
instead
of
returning
at
present
to
her
lonely
home
with
this
view
leaving
the
main
road
that
ran
through
rewtham
bratham
and
isleworth
to
roxham
she
turned
up
a
little
which
led
to
the
foot
of
the
lake
just
as
she
did
so
she
heard
the
deadened
footfall
of
a
horse
accompanied
by
the
faint
roll
of
over
the
snow
as
she
turned
half
involuntarily
to
see
who
it
was
that
travelled
so
fast
the
creeping
mist
was
driven
aside
by
a
puff
of
wind
and
she
saw
a
splendid
horse
drawing
an
open
victoria
trotting
past
her
at
at
least
twelve
miles
an
hour
but
quickly
as
it
passed
it
was
not
too
quick
for
her
to
recognize
lady
bellamy
wrapped
up
in
furs
her
dark
stern
face
looking
on
straight
before
her
as
though
the
mist
had
no
power
to
dim
sight
next
second
the
dark
closed
in
and
the
carriage
had
vanished
like
a
dream
in
the
direction
of
isleworth
angela
shivered
the
dark
afternoon
seemed
to
have
grown
darker
to
her
she
back
she
said
to
herself
felt
that
she
was
back
she
makes
me
feel
going
on
her
way
she
came
to
a
spot
where
the
path
forked
one
track
leading
to
a
plank
with
a
spanning
the
stream
that
fed
the
lake
and
the
other
to
some
by
crossing
which
and
following
the
path
on
the
other
side
a
short
cut
could
be
made
to
the
rectory
the
bridge
and
the
were
not
more
than
twenty
yards
apart
but
so
intent
was
angela
upon
her
own
thoughts
and
upon
placing
her
feet
accurately
on
the
stones
that
she
did
not
notice
a
little
man
with
a
red
comforter
who
was
leaning
on
the
engaged
apparently
in
meditation
the
little
man
however
noticed
her
for
he
gave
a
violent
start
and
apparently
was
about
to
call
out
to
her
when
he
changed
his
mind
he
was
sir
john
bellamy
let
her
go
perhaps
john
he
said
addressing
his
own
effigy
in
the
water
all
it
will
be
best
for
you
to
let
things
take
their
course
and
not
to
burn
your
own
fingers
or
commit
yourself
in
any
way
john
you
will
trap
them
more
securely
so
if
you
were
to
warn
the
girl
now
you
would
only
expose
them
if
you
wait
till
he
has
married
her
you
will
altogether
destroy
them
with
the
help
of
that
young
heigham
and
perhaps
by
that
time
you
will
have
touched
those
compromising
letters
john
and
made
a
few
other
little
arrangements
and
then
you
will
be
able
to
enjoy
the
sweets
of
revenge
meted
out
with
a
quart
measure
not
in
beggarly
ones
or
twos
but
you
are
thinking
of
the
john
ah
you
always
were
a
pitiful
beggar
but
tread
down
the
inclination
decline
to
gratify
it
if
you
do
you
will
spoil
your
own
hand
the
girl
must
take
her
clearly
the
girl
must
take
her
chance
but
all
the
same
john
you
are
very
sorry
for
come
come
you
must
be
off
or
her
ladyship
and
the
gentle
george
will
be
kept
waiting
and
away
he
went
at
a
brisk
pace
cheerfully
singing
a
verse
of
a
comic
song
sir
john
was
a
merry
little
man
in
due
course
angela
reached
the
rectory
and
found
fraser
seated
in
his
study
reading
my
dear
what
brings
you
here
what
a
dreary
night
it
is
dreadfully
damp
and
lonesome
the
people
look
like
ghosts
in
the
mist
and
their
voices
sound
hollow
a
proper
day
for
evil
things
to
creep
home
and
she
laughed
drearily
do
you
mean
he
answered
with
a
quick
glance
at
her
face
which
wore
an
expression
of
nervous
anxiety
mean
that
lady
bellamy
has
come
home
is
she
not
an
evil
thing
angela
you
should
not
talk
so
you
are
excited
dear
why
should
you
call
her
evil
know
but
have
you
ever
noticed
her
have
you
never
seen
her
creep
creep
like
a
tiger
on
its
prey
watch
her
dark
face
and
see
the
bad
thoughts
come
and
peep
out
of
her
eyes
as
the
great
black
pupils
swell
and
then
shrivel
till
they
are
no
larger
than
the
head
of
this
black
pin
and
you
will
know
that
she
is
evil
and
does
evil
dear
my
dear
you
are
upset
to
talk
no
i
am
not
upset
but
did
you
ever
have
a
presentiment
but
never
one
that
came
i
have
a
presentiment
a
caught
me
in
the
is
it
i
am
anxious
to
can
not
say
it
is
not
clear
in
my
mind
i
can
not
see
it
but
it
is
evil
and
it
has
to
do
with
that
evil
angela
you
must
not
give
way
to
this
sort
of
thing
you
will
make
yourself
ill
sit
down
there
is
a
good
girl
and
have
some
she
was
standing
by
the
window
staring
out
into
the
mist
her
fingers
alternately
intertwining
and
unlacing
themselves
whilst
an
almost
an
unearthly
expression
played
upon
her
face
turning
she
obeyed
him
need
not
fear
for
me
i
am
tough
and
growing
used
to
troubles
what
was
it
you
said
oh
tea
thank
you
that
reminds
me
will
you
come
and
have
dinner
with
me
after
church
it
is
christmas
day
you
know
pigott
has
given
me
a
turkey
she
has
been
fatting
and
i
made
the
mincemeat
myself
so
there
will
be
plenty
to
eat
if
we
can
find
the
heart
to
eat
your
father
my
dear
you
need
not
be
afraid
i
have
got
permission
to
ask
you
what
do
you
think
i
actually
talked
to
my
father
for
ten
whole
minutes
yesterday
he
wanted
to
avoid
me
when
he
saw
me
but
i
caught
him
in
a
corner
he
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
try
to
prevent
me
from
going
to
see
pigott
but
i
would
not
listen
to
him
so
he
gave
it
up
what
did
he
mean
by
that
why
did
he
send
her
away
what
does
it
all
mean
oh
arthur
when
will
you
come
back
arthur
and
to
infinite
distress
she
burst
into
tears
chapter
xlix
presentiments
are
no
doubt
foolish
things
and
yet
at
the
time
that
angela
was
speaking
of
hers
to
fraser
a
consultation
was
going
on
in
a
back
study
at
isleworth
that
might
almost
have
justified
it
the
fire
was
the
only
light
in
the
room
and
gathered
round
it
talking
very
low
their
features
thrown
alternately
into
strong
light
and
dark
shadow
were
george
caresfoot
and
sir
john
and
lady
bellamy
it
was
evident
from
the
strong
expression
of
interest
almost
of
excitement
on
their
faces
that
they
were
talking
of
some
matter
of
great
importance
sir
john
was
as
usual
perched
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
rubbing
his
dry
hands
and
eliciting
occasional
sparks
in
the
shape
of
remarks
but
he
was
no
longer
merry
indeed
he
looked
ill
at
ease
george
his
red
hair
all
rumpled
up
and
his
long
limbs
thrust
out
towards
the
fire
spoke
scarcely
at
all
but
glued
his
little
bloodshot
eyes
alternately
on
the
faces
of
his
companions
and
only
contributed
an
occasional
chuckle
but
the
soul
of
this
gathering
was
evidently
lady
bellamy
she
was
standing
up
and
energetically
detailing
some
scheme
the
great
pupils
of
her
eyes
expanding
and
contracting
as
the
unholy
flame
within
them
rose
and
fell
that
is
settled
she
said
at
last
george
nodded
bellamy
said
nothing
suppose
that
silence
gives
consent
very
well
i
will
take
the
first
step
i
do
not
like
angela
caresfoot
but
upon
my
word
i
shall
be
sorry
for
her
before
she
is
hours
older
she
is
made
of
too
fine
a
material
to
be
sold
into
such
hands
as
yours
george
george
looked
up
menacingly
but
said
nothing
have
often
urged
you
to
give
this
up
now
i
urge
no
thing
is
done
in
spirit
it
may
as
well
be
done
in
reality
i
told
you
long
ago
that
it
was
a
most
dreadfully
wicked
thing
and
that
nothing
but
evil
can
come
of
it
do
not
say
that
i
have
not
warned
stop
that
talk
growled
george
talk
is
a
good
word
george
for
it
is
of
the
wages
that
i
am
telling
you
now
listen
i
am
going
to
prophesy
a
curse
will
fall
upon
this
house
and
all
within
it
would
you
like
to
have
a
sign
that
i
speak
the
truth
then
she
was
standing
up
her
hand
stretched
out
and
in
the
dim
light
she
looked
like
some
heathen
princess
urging
a
bloody
sacrifice
to
her
gods
her
forebodings
terrified
her
hearers
and
by
a
common
impulse
they
rose
and
moved
away
from
her
at
that
moment
a
strange
thing
happened
a
gust
of
wind
making
its
way
from
some
entrance
in
the
back
of
the
house
burst
open
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
they
were
and
entered
with
a
cold
flap
as
of
wings
next
second
a
terrible
crash
resounded
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
george
turned
white
as
a
sheet
and
sank
into
a
chair
cursing
feebly
bellamy
gave
a
sort
of
howl
of
terror
and
shrank
up
to
his
wife
almost
falling
into
the
fire
in
his
efforts
to
get
behind
her
lady
bellamy
alone
remaining
erect
and
undaunted
laughed
aloud
one
of
you
brave
conspirators
against
a
defenceless
girl
strike
a
light
for
the
place
is
as
dark
as
a
vault
and
let
us
see
what
has
happened
i
told
you
that
you
should
have
a
after
several
efforts
george
succeeded
in
doing
as
she
bade
him
and
held
a
candle
forward
in
his
trembling
hand
be
foolish
she
said
picture
has
fallen
that
is
he
advanced
to
look
at
it
and
then
benefited
his
companions
with
a
further
assortment
of
curses
the
picture
on
examination
proved
to
be
a
large
one
that
he
had
some
years
previously
had
painted
of
isleworth
with
the
bellamys
and
himself
in
the
foreground
the
frame
was
shattered
and
all
the
centre
of
the
canvass
torn
out
by
the
weight
of
its
fall
on
to
a
and
beautiful
statue
of
andromeda
chained
to
a
rock
awaiting
her
fate
with
a
staring
look
of
agonized
terror
in
her
eyes
omen
a
very
palpable
omen
said
lady
bellamy
with
one
of
her
dark
smiles
and
ourselves
destroyed
by
being
smashed
against
a
marble
girl
who
rises
uninjured
from
the
wreck
eh
john
touch
me
you
sorceress
replied
sir
john
who
was
shaking
with
fear
believe
that
you
are
satan
in
are
strangely
complimentary
even
for
a
i
am
but
i
know
your
dark
ways
and
your
dealings
with
your
master
and
i
tell
you
both
what
it
is
i
have
done
with
the
job
i
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
it
i
will
know
nothing
more
about
hear
what
he
says
said
lady
bellamy
to
george
does
not
like
omens
for
the
last
time
will
you
give
it
up
or
will
you
go
on
give
her
indeed
it
would
kill
me
answered
george
wringing
his
hands
is
a
fiend
driving
me
along
this
a
doubt
of
it
said
sir
john
who
was
staring
at
the
broken
picture
with
chattering
teeth
and
his
eyes
almost
starting
out
of
his
head
if
i
were
you
i
should
get
him
to
drive
me
a
little
straighter
are
poor
creatures
both
of
you
said
lady
bellamy
we
will
then
decide
to
go
ruat
coelum
said
sir
john
who
knew
a
little
latin
and
frightened
as
he
was
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
air
it
and
then
they
went
and
left
george
still
contemplating
the
stricken
face
of
the
nude
marble
virgin
whose
eyes
appeared
to
gaze
upon
the
ruins
of
his
picture
next
morning
being
christmas
day
lady
bellamy
went
to
church
as
behoves
a
good
christian
and
listened
to
the
divine
message
of
peace
on
earth
and
towards
men
so
for
the
matter
of
that
did
george
and
so
did
angela
after
church
lady
bellamy
went
home
to
lunch
but
she
was
in
no
mood
for
eating
so
she
left
the
table
and
ordered
the
victoria
to
be
round
in
half
an
hour
after
church
too
angela
and
fraser
ate
their
christmas
dinner
melancholy
had
to
some
extent
melted
beneath
the
genial
influence
of
the
and
her
mind
had
taken
comfort
from
the
words
of
peace
and
everlasting
love
that
she
had
heard
that
morning
and
for
awhile
at
any
rate
she
had
forgotten
her
forebodings
the
unaccustomed
splendour
of
the
dinner
too
had
diverted
her
attention
for
she
was
easily
pleased
with
such
things
and
altogether
she
was
in
a
more
comfortable
frame
of
mind
than
she
had
been
on
the
previous
evening
and
was
inclined
to
indulge
in
a
pleasant
talk
with
fraser
upon
various
subjects
mostly
classical
and
arthurian
she
had
already
cracked
some
filberts
for
him
plucked
by
herself
in
the
autumn
and
specially
saved
in
a
damp
jar
and
was
about
to
settle
herself
in
a
chair
by
the
fire
when
suddenly
she
turned
white
and
stood
quite
still
she
said
you
hear
it
what
big
black
horse
that
trots
so
can
hear
nothing
i
can
she
is
on
the
yet
she
will
be
here
very
soon
that
horse
trots
angela
it
is
some
other
but
as
he
spoke
the
sound
of
a
powerful
animal
trotting
very
rapidly
became
distinctly
audible
has
evil
she
has
brought
dear
somebody
to
see
your
father
no
a
minute
elapsed
and
then
jakes
now
the
only
servant
in
the
house
was
heard
shuffling
along
the
passage
followed
by
a
firm
light
step
leave
me
said
angela
to
fraser
give
me
strength
to
bear
it
she
went
on
beneath
her
breath
she
was
still
standing
staring
vacantly
towards
the
door
pale
and
her
bosom
heaving
the
intensity
of
her
anxiety
had
to
some
extent
communicated
itself
to
fraser
for
there
are
few
things
so
catching
as
anxiety
except
enthusiasm
he
too
had
risen
and
was
standing
in
an
attitude
of
expectancy
bellamy
to
see
yer
said
jakes
pushing
her
head
through
the
door
next
second
she
had
entered
must
apologise
for
disturbing
you
at
dinner
angela
she
began
hurriedly
and
then
stopped
and
also
stood
still
there
was
something
very
curious
about
her
reception
she
thought
both
fraser
and
angela
might
have
been
cut
out
of
stone
for
neither
moved
standing
thus
in
the
silence
of
expectancy
the
three
made
a
strange
picture
on
lady
face
there
was
a
look
of
stern
determination
and
suppressed
excitement
such
as
became
one
about
to
commit
a
crime
at
last
she
broke
the
silence
come
to
bring
you
bad
news
angela
she
said
have
you
to
say
tell
me
quick
no
stop
hear
me
before
you
speak
if
you
have
come
here
with
any
evil
in
your
heart
or
with
the
intention
to
deceive
or
betray
pause
before
you
answer
i
am
a
lonely
and
almost
friendless
woman
and
have
no
claim
except
upon
your
compassion
but
it
is
not
always
well
to
deal
ill
with
such
as
i
since
we
have
at
last
a
friend
whose
vengeance
you
too
must
fear
so
by
the
love
of
christ
and
by
the
presence
of
the
god
who
made
you
speak
to
me
only
such
truth
as
you
will
utter
at
his
judgment
now
answer
i
am
at
her
words
spoken
with
an
earnestness
and
in
a
voice
which
made
them
almost
awful
a
momentary
expression
of
fear
swept
across
lady
face
but
it
went
as
quickly
as
it
came
and
the
hard
determined
look
returned
the
mysterious
eyes
grew
cold
and
glittered
the
head
erected
itself
at
that
moment
lady
bellamy
distinctly
reminded
fraser
of
a
hooded
cobra
about
to
strike
i
to
speak
before
fraser
is
the
good
of
this
talk
angela
you
seem
to
know
my
news
before
i
give
it
and
believe
me
it
pains
me
very
much
to
have
to
give
it
is
dead
the
cobra
had
struck
but
as
yet
the
poison
had
scarcely
begun
to
work
there
was
only
numbness
fraser
gave
a
gasp
and
half
dropped
half
fell
into
his
chair
the
noise
attracted
attention
and
pressing
her
hand
to
her
forehead
she
turned
towards
him
with
a
ghost
of
a
laugh
i
not
tell
you
that
this
evil
woman
would
bring
evil
then
addressing
lady
bellamy
stop
you
forget
what
i
said
to
you
you
do
not
speak
the
truth
arthur
dead
how
can
arthur
be
dead
and
i
alive
how
is
it
that
i
do
not
know
he
is
dead
oh
for
shame
it
is
not
true
he
is
not
seems
to
me
to
be
a
thankless
as
well
as
a
painful
task
said
lady
bellamy
hoarsely
if
you
will
not
believe
me
look
here
you
know
this
i
suppose
i
took
it
as
he
asked
me
to
do
from
his
dead
hand
that
it
might
be
given
back
to
heigham
is
dead
said
fraser
do
you
know
it
where
did
he
die
and
what
of
know
it
fraser
because
it
was
my
sad
duty
to
nurse
him
through
his
last
illness
at
madeira
he
died
of
enteric
fever
i
have
got
a
copy
of
his
burial
certificate
here
which
i
had
taken
from
the
portuguese
books
he
seems
to
have
had
no
relations
living
poor
young
man
but
sir
john
communicated
with
the
family
lawyer
here
is
the
certificate
and
she
handed
fraser
a
paper
written
in
portuguese
and
officially
stamped
say
broke
in
angela
you
took
this
ring
from
his
dead
hand
the
hand
on
which
i
placed
it
i
do
not
believe
you
you
beguiled
it
from
his
living
hand
it
can
not
be
that
he
is
dead
for
if
he
were
i
should
have
felt
it
oh
arthur
and
in
her
misery
she
stretched
out
her
arms
and
turned
her
agonized
eyes
upwards
you
are
dead
come
to
me
and
let
me
see
your
spirit
face
and
hear
the
whisper
of
your
wings
have
you
no
voice
in
the
silence
you
see
he
does
not
come
he
is
not
dead
if
he
were
dead
heaven
could
not
hold
him
from
my
side
or
if
it
could
it
would
have
drawn
me
up
to
love
my
love
said
fraser
in
a
scared
voice
is
not
will
that
the
dead
should
come
back
to
us
poor
angela
why
will
you
not
believe
me
this
is
so
very
painful
do
you
suppose
that
i
want
to
torture
you
by
saying
what
is
not
true
about
your
love
the
idea
is
absurd
i
had
meant
to
keep
it
till
you
were
calmer
but
i
have
a
letter
for
you
read
it
and
convince
angela
almost
snatched
the
paper
from
her
outstretched
hand
it
ran
thus
in
characters
almost
illegible
from
weakness
i
am
dying
of
fever
lady
bellamy
will
take
back
your
ring
when
it
is
over
try
to
forget
me
and
be
happy
too
weak
to
write
more
at
the
foot
of
this
broken
and
almost
illegible
letter
was
scrawled
the
word
angela
read
it
slowly
and
then
at
length
the
poison
did
its
work
she
did
not
speak
wildly
any
more
or
call
upon
arthur
she
was
stung
back
to
sense
but
all
the
light
went
out
of
her
eyes
is
his
writing
she
said
slowly
beg
your
pardon
it
was
good
of
you
to
nurse
then
pressing
the
paper
to
her
bosom
with
one
hand
with
the
other
she
groped
her
way
towards
the
door
is
very
dark
she
said
lady
eyes
gave
a
flash
of
triumph
and
then
she
stood
watching
the
pitiable
exhibition
of
human
misery
as
curiously
as
ever
a
roman
matron
did
an
expiring
gladiator
when
angela
was
near
the
door
the
letter
still
pressed
against
her
heart
she
spoke
again
blow
comes
from
god
angela
and
the
religion
and
spiritual
theories
which
you
believe
in
will
bring
you
consolation
most
likely
it
is
a
blessing
in
thing
that
you
will
in
time
even
learn
to
be
thankful
lady
bellamy
had
overacted
her
part
the
words
did
not
ring
true
they
jarred
upon
fraser
much
more
did
they
jar
upon
torn
nerves
her
pale
cheek
flushed
and
she
turned
and
spoke
but
there
was
no
anger
in
her
face
nothing
but
sorrow
that
dignified
and
unfathomable
love
lost
in
its
own
depths
only
the
eyes
seemed
as
sightless
as
those
of
one
walking
in
her
sleep
your
hour
of
dreadful
trouble
comes
as
it
will
come
pray
god
that
there
may
be
none
to
mock
you
as
you
mock
and
she
turned
like
a
stricken
thing
and
went
slowly
out
blindly
groping
her
way
along
her
last
words
had
hit
the
victor
hard
who
can
say
what
hidden
string
they
touched
or
what
prescience
of
evil
they
awakened
but
they
went
nigh
to
felling
her
clutching
the
lady
bellamy
gasped
for
air
then
recovering
a
little
she
said
god
that
is
fraser
scarcely
saw
this
last
incident
so
overwhelmed
was
he
at
the
sight
of
agony
that
he
had
covered
his
face
with
his
hand
when
he
lifted
it
again
lady
bellamy
was
gone
and
he
was
alone
chapter
three
months
had
passed
since
that
awful
christmas
day
angela
was
and
after
the
first
burst
of
her
despair
turned
herself
to
the
only
consolation
which
was
left
her
it
was
not
of
this
world
she
did
not
question
the
truth
of
the
dreadful
news
that
lady
bellamy
had
brought
her
and
if
ever
a
doubt
did
arise
in
her
breast
a
glance
at
the
ring
and
the
letter
effectually
quelled
it
nor
did
she
get
or
any
other
illness
her
young
and
healthy
frame
was
too
strong
a
citadel
to
be
taken
out
of
hand
by
sorrow
and
this
to
her
was
one
of
the
most
wonderful
things
in
her
affliction
it
had
come
and
crushed
her
and
life
still
went
on
much
as
before
the
sun
of
her
system
had
fallen
and
yet
the
system
was
not
appreciably
deranged
it
was
dreadful
to
her
to
think
that
arthur
was
dead
but
an
added
sting
lay
in
the
fact
that
she
was
not
dead
too
oh
how
glad
she
would
have
been
to
die
since
death
had
become
the
gate
through
which
she
needs
must
pass
to
reach
her
side
for
it
had
been
given
to
angela
living
so
much
alone
and
thinking
so
long
and
deeply
upon
these
great
mysteries
of
our
being
to
soar
to
the
heights
of
a
noble
faith
to
the
intense
purity
of
her
mind
a
living
heaven
presented
itself
a
comfortable
place
very
different
from
the
vague
and
formularised
abstractions
with
which
we
are
for
the
most
part
satisfied
where
arthur
and
her
mother
were
waiting
to
greet
her
and
where
the
great
light
of
the
godhead
would
shine
around
them
all
she
grew
to
hate
her
life
the
dull
barrier
of
the
flesh
that
stood
between
her
and
her
ends
still
she
ate
and
drank
enough
to
support
it
still
dressed
with
the
same
perfect
neatness
as
before
still
lived
in
short
as
though
arthur
had
not
died
and
the
light
and
colour
had
not
gone
out
of
her
world
one
was
in
was
sitting
in
study
reading
the
which
arthur
had
given
to
her
and
in
the
woes
of
others
striving
to
forget
her
own
but
the
attempt
proved
a
failure
she
could
not
concentrate
her
thoughts
they
would
continually
wander
away
into
space
in
search
of
arthur
she
was
dressed
in
black
from
the
day
that
she
heard
her
lover
was
dead
she
would
wear
no
other
colour
and
as
she
gazed
with
her
hands
idly
clasped
before
her
out
at
the
driving
sleet
and
snow
fraser
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
statue
picture
or
woman
of
such
sweet
yet
majestic
beauty
but
it
had
been
filched
from
the
features
of
an
immortal
the
which
at
times
had
visited
her
from
a
child
now
continually
shone
upon
her
face
and
to
the
sight
of
sinful
men
her
eyes
seemed
almost
awful
in
their
solemn
calm
and
purity
she
smiled
but
seldom
now
and
when
she
did
it
was
in
those
grey
eyes
that
the
radiance
began
her
features
scarcely
seemed
to
move
are
you
thinking
of
angela
am
thinking
fraser
that
it
is
only
fourteen
weeks
since
arthur
died
and
that
it
is
very
likely
that
i
shall
live
another
forty
or
fifty
years
before
i
see
him
i
am
only
and
i
am
so
strong
even
this
shock
has
not
hurt
should
you
want
to
die
all
the
beauty
and
light
has
gone
out
of
my
life
because
i
prefer
to
trust
myself
into
the
hands
of
god
rather
than
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
world
because
he
is
there
and
i
am
here
and
i
am
tired
of
you
no
fear
of
death
have
never
feared
death
and
least
of
all
do
i
fear
it
now
why
the
veriest
coward
would
not
shrink
back
when
the
man
she
loved
was
waiting
for
her
and
i
am
not
a
coward
and
if
i
were
told
that
i
must
die
within
an
hour
i
could
say
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
are
the
feet
of
him
that
bringeth
good
tidings
that
publisheth
peace
can
not
you
understand
me
if
all
your
life
and
soul
were
wrapped
up
in
one
person
and
she
died
would
you
not
long
to
go
to
her
fraser
made
no
reply
for
a
while
but
in
his
turn
gazed
out
at
the
drifting
snow
surely
not
more
immaculately
pure
than
this
woman
who
could
love
with
so
divine
a
love
at
length
he
spoke
do
you
know
that
it
is
wrong
to
talk
so
you
have
no
right
to
set
yourself
up
against
the
decrees
of
the
almighty
in
his
wisdom
he
is
working
out
ends
of
which
you
are
one
of
the
instruments
who
are
you
that
you
should
rebel
grain
an
atom
a
feather
but
what
am
i
to
do
with
my
life
how
am
i
to
occupy
all
the
coming
years
your
abilities
that
is
a
question
easy
to
answer
work
write
take
the
place
in
scholastic
or
social
literature
which
i
have
trained
you
to
fill
for
you
fame
and
fortune
lie
in
an
inkstand
your
mind
is
a
golden
key
that
will
open
to
your
sight
all
that
is
worth
seeing
in
the
world
and
pass
you
into
its
most
pleasant
places
you
can
become
a
famous
woman
she
turned
upon
him
sadly
had
such
ideas
for
sake
i
wished
to
do
something
great
indeed
i
had
already
formed
a
plan
but
fraser
like
many
another
when
i
lost
my
love
i
lost
my
ambition
too
both
lie
buried
in
his
grave
i
have
nothing
left
to
work
for
i
do
not
care
for
fame
or
money
for
myself
they
would
only
have
been
valuable
to
give
to
him
at
i
seem
to
have
done
with
the
rewards
and
punishments
its
blanks
and
prizes
its
satisfactions
and
desires
even
before
i
have
learnt
what
they
are
my
hopes
are
as
dull
and
leaden
as
that
sky
and
yet
the
sun
is
behind
it
yes
that
is
my
only
hope
the
sun
is
behind
it
though
we
can
not
see
it
do
not
talk
to
me
of
ambition
fraser
i
am
and
my
only
ambition
is
for
rest
the
rest
he
gives
to
his
angela
that
is
the
cry
of
us
all
we
strive
for
rest
and
here
we
never
find
it
you
suffer
but
do
not
think
that
you
are
alone
everybody
suffers
in
their
degree
though
perhaps
such
as
you
with
the
nerves
of
your
mind
bared
to
the
roughness
of
the
weather
feel
mental
pain
the
more
acutely
but
my
dear
there
are
few
really
refined
men
and
women
of
sensitive
organization
who
have
not
at
times
sent
up
that
prayer
for
rest
any
rest
even
eternal
sleep
it
is
the
price
they
pay
for
their
refinement
but
they
are
not
alone
if
the
cry
of
every
being
who
endures
in
this
great
universe
could
be
collected
into
a
single
prayer
that
prayer
would
be
who
made
us
in
pity
give
us
we
suffer
no
doubt
all
of
us
and
implore
a
peace
that
does
not
come
we
must
learn
black
is
night
when
golden
day
is
done
how
drear
the
blindness
that
hath
seen
the
sun
can
tell
me
that
but
tell
me
you
who
are
a
clergyman
and
stronger
to
stand
against
sorrow
than
i
how
can
we
win
even
a
partial
peace
and
draw
the
sting
from
suffering
if
you
know
a
way
however
hard
tell
it
me
for
do
you
know
and
she
put
her
hand
to
her
head
and
a
vacant
look
came
into
her
eyes
think
that
if
i
have
to
endure
much
more
of
the
anguish
which
i
sometimes
suffer
or
get
any
more
shocks
i
shall
go
mad
i
try
to
look
to
the
future
only
and
to
rise
superior
to
my
sorrows
and
to
a
certain
extent
i
succeed
but
my
mind
will
not
always
carry
the
strain
put
upon
it
but
falls
heavily
to
earth
like
a
winged
bird
then
it
is
that
deprived
of
its
higher
food
and
left
to
feed
upon
its
own
sadness
and
to
brood
upon
the
bare
fact
of
the
death
of
the
man
i
sometimes
think
as
men
are
not
often
my
spirit
almost
breaks
down
if
you
can
tell
me
any
cure
anything
which
will
bring
me
comfort
i
shall
indeed
be
grateful
to
think
i
can
angela
if
you
will
no
longer
devote
yourself
to
study
you
have
only
to
look
round
to
find
another
answer
to
your
question
as
to
what
you
are
to
do
are
there
no
poor
in
these
parts
for
you
to
visit
can
not
your
hands
make
clothes
to
cover
those
who
have
none
is
there
no
sickness
that
you
can
nurse
no
sorrow
that
you
can
comfort
i
know
that
even
in
this
parish
there
are
many
homes
where
your
presence
would
be
as
welcome
as
a
sunbeam
in
winter
remember
angela
that
grief
can
be
selfish
as
well
as
are
right
fraser
you
always
are
right
i
think
i
am
selfish
in
my
trouble
but
it
is
a
fault
that
i
will
try
to
mend
indeed
to
look
at
it
in
that
light
only
my
time
is
of
no
benefit
to
myself
i
may
as
well
devote
it
to
you
do
your
labour
will
bring
its
own
reward
for
in
helping
others
to
bear
their
load
you
will
wonderfully
lighten
your
own
nor
need
you
go
far
to
begin
why
do
you
not
see
more
of
your
own
father
you
are
naturally
bound
to
love
him
yet
it
is
but
rarely
that
you
speak
to
father
you
know
he
does
not
like
me
my
presence
is
always
a
source
of
irritation
to
him
he
can
not
even
bear
me
to
look
at
surely
that
must
be
your
fancy
probably
he
thinks
you
do
not
care
about
him
he
has
always
been
a
strange
and
wayward
man
i
know
but
you
should
remember
that
he
has
had
bitter
disappointments
in
life
and
try
to
soften
him
and
win
him
to
other
thoughts
do
this
and
you
will
soon
find
that
he
will
be
glad
enough
of
your
will
try
to
do
as
you
say
fraser
but
i
confess
i
have
only
small
hopes
of
any
success
in
that
direction
have
you
any
parish
work
i
can
do
nor
did
the
matter
end
there
as
is
so
often
the
case
where
parish
work
and
young
ladies
are
concerned
angela
set
to
her
charitable
duties
with
a
steady
determination
that
made
her
services
very
valuable
she
undertook
the
sole
management
of
a
clothing
club
in
itself
a
maddening
thing
to
ordinary
mortals
and
had
an
eye
to
the
distribution
of
the
parish
coals
of
meetings
and
other
cheerful
parochial
entertainments
she
became
the
life
and
soul
giving
up
her
mathematics
and
classical
reading
she
took
to
knitting
vests
and
socks
instead
indeed
the
number
of
articles
which
her
nimble
fingers
turned
out
in
a
fortnight
was
a
pleasant
surprise
for
the
cold
toes
of
the
babies
and
as
fraser
had
prophesied
she
found
that
her
labour
was
of
a
sort
which
brought
a
certain
reward
chapter
li
on
one
point
however
efforts
failed
completely
she
could
make
no
headway
with
her
father
he
shrank
more
than
ever
from
her
society
and
at
last
asked
her
to
oblige
him
by
allowing
him
to
follow
his
own
path
in
peace
of
death
he
had
never
spoken
to
her
or
she
to
him
but
she
knew
that
he
had
heard
of
it
philip
had
heard
of
it
thus
on
that
christmas
afternoon
he
had
been
taking
his
daily
exercise
when
he
met
lady
bellamy
returning
from
the
abbey
house
the
carriage
stopped
and
she
got
out
to
speak
to
him
you
been
to
the
abbey
house
to
pay
a
christmas
visit
he
asked
is
very
kind
of
you
to
come
and
see
us
so
soon
after
your
am
the
bearer
of
bad
news
so
i
did
not
news
what
was
it
heigham
is
dead
she
answered
watching
his
face
narrowly
impossible
died
of
enteric
fever
at
madeira
i
have
just
been
to
break
the
news
to
indeed
she
will
be
pained
she
was
very
fond
of
him
you
lady
bellamy
smiled
contemptuously
you
ever
see
any
one
put
to
the
extremest
torture
if
you
have
you
can
guess
how
your
daughter
was
philip
winced
i
help
it
it
is
no
affair
of
mine
and
then
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
hearing
wonder
if
she
lies
or
if
she
has
murdered
him
george
must
have
been
putting
on
the
into
the
particulars
of
arthur
death
or
supposed
death
he
never
inquired
why
should
he
it
was
no
affair
of
his
he
had
long
ago
washed
his
hands
of
the
whole
matter
and
left
things
take
their
chance
if
he
was
dead
well
and
good
he
was
very
sorry
for
him
if
he
was
alive
well
and
good
also
in
that
case
he
would
no
doubt
arrive
on
the
appointed
date
to
marry
angela
but
notwithstanding
all
this
unanswerable
reasoning
he
still
found
it
quite
impossible
to
look
his
daughter
in
the
face
her
eyes
still
burnt
him
ay
even
more
than
ever
did
they
burn
for
her
widowed
dress
and
brow
were
agony
to
him
and
rent
his
heart
not
with
remorse
but
fear
but
still
his
greed
kept
the
upper
hand
though
death
by
mental
torture
must
result
yet
he
would
glut
himself
with
his
desire
more
than
ever
he
hungered
for
those
wide
lands
which
if
only
things
fell
out
right
would
become
his
at
so
ridiculous
a
price
decidedly
arthur
death
was
affair
of
about
six
weeks
before
conversation
with
fraser
which
ended
in
her
undertaking
parish
work
a
rumour
had
got
about
that
george
caresfoot
had
been
taken
ill
very
seriously
ill
it
was
said
that
a
chill
had
settled
on
his
lungs
which
had
never
been
very
strong
since
his
fever
and
that
he
had
in
short
gone
into
a
consumption
of
george
angela
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
anything
for
some
not
since
she
received
the
welcome
letter
in
which
he
relinquished
his
suit
she
had
indeed
with
that
natural
readiness
of
the
human
mind
to
forget
unpleasant
occurrences
thought
but
little
about
him
of
late
since
her
mind
had
been
more
fully
occupied
with
other
and
more
pressing
things
still
she
vaguely
wondered
at
times
if
he
was
really
so
ill
as
her
father
thought
one
day
she
was
walking
home
by
the
path
round
the
lake
after
paying
a
visit
to
a
sick
child
in
the
village
when
she
suddenly
came
face
to
face
with
her
father
she
expected
that
he
would
as
usual
pass
on
without
addressing
her
and
drew
to
one
side
of
the
path
to
allow
him
to
do
so
but
to
her
surprise
he
stopped
have
you
been
angela
see
ellen
mim
she
is
very
ill
poor
had
better
be
careful
you
will
be
catching
scarlet
fever
or
is
a
great
deal
am
not
at
all
but
you
never
think
that
you
may
bring
it
home
to
never
thought
that
there
was
any
likelihood
of
my
bringing
anything
to
you
we
see
so
little
of
each
well
i
have
been
to
isleworth
to
see
your
cousin
george
he
is
very
told
me
that
he
was
ill
some
time
back
what
is
it
that
is
really
the
matter
with
him
consumption
he
can
not
last
man
why
does
he
not
go
to
a
warmer
climate
is
his
affair
but
it
is
a
serious
matter
for
me
if
he
dies
under
present
circumstances
all
the
isleworth
estates
which
are
mine
by
right
must
pass
away
from
the
family
must
they
pass
away
your
grandfather
with
a
refined
ingenuity
made
a
provision
in
his
will
that
george
was
not
to
leave
them
back
to
me
as
he
was
telling
me
this
afternoon
he
is
anxious
to
do
if
he
were
to
die
now
with
a
will
in
my
favour
or
without
any
will
at
all
they
would
all
go
to
some
far
away
cousins
in
died
of
did
he
not
grandfather
i
mean
face
grew
black
as
night
and
he
shot
a
quick
glance
of
suspicion
at
his
daughter
was
saying
he
went
on
without
answering
her
question
george
may
sell
the
land
or
settle
it
but
must
not
leave
it
to
me
or
you
nor
can
i
take
under
an
angela
did
not
understand
these
legal
intricacies
and
knew
about
as
much
about
the
law
of
intestacy
as
she
did
of
egyptian
inscriptions
she
said
consolingly
am
very
sorry
but
it
be
helped
can
it
girl
is
a
born
fool
muttered
philip
beneath
his
breath
and
passed
on
a
week
or
so
afterwards
just
when
the
primroses
and
were
at
the
meridian
of
their
beauty
and
all
the
air
was
full
of
song
angela
heard
more
about
her
cousin
george
fraser
was
one
day
sent
for
to
isleworth
lady
bellamy
brought
him
the
message
saying
that
george
was
in
such
a
state
of
health
that
he
wished
to
see
a
clergyman
never
saw
a
worse
case
he
said
to
angela
on
his
return
does
not
leave
the
house
but
lies
in
a
darkened
room
coughing
and
spitting
blood
he
is
i
should
say
going
off
fast
but
he
refuses
to
see
a
doctor
his
frame
of
mind
however
is
most
christian
and
he
seems
to
have
reconciled
himself
to
the
prospect
of
a
speedy
man
said
angela
sympathetically
sent
and
asked
to
see
you
did
he
not
but
when
i
got
there
he
talked
more
about
the
things
of
this
world
than
of
the
next
he
is
greatly
distressed
about
your
father
i
daresay
you
have
heard
how
your
cousin
george
supplanted
your
father
in
the
succession
to
the
isleworth
estates
your
grandfather
disinherited
him
you
know
because
of
his
marriage
with
your
mother
now
that
he
is
dying
he
sees
the
injustice
of
this
but
is
prevented
by
the
terms
of
your
will
from
restoring
the
land
to
your
branch
of
the
family
so
it
must
pass
to
some
distant
least
so
i
understand
the
always
told
me
that
it
is
easy
to
drive
a
coach
and
four
through
wills
and
settlements
and
legal
things
if
he
is
so
anxious
to
do
so
can
he
not
find
a
way
out
of
the
mean
some
honourable
way
i
believe
not
except
an
impossible
one
and
fraser
smiled
a
rather
forced
smile
is
that
asked
angela
carelessly
that
he
marry
before
he
dies
at
least
you
know
he
says
that
that
is
the
only
way
in
which
he
could
legally
transfer
the
angela
started
and
turned
pale
i
am
afraid
the
estates
will
never
be
transferred
how
would
that
help
him
he
says
he
could
then
enter
into
a
nominal
sale
of
the
estates
to
your
father
and
settle
the
money
on
why
could
he
not
do
this
without
marrying
me
know
i
understand
much
about
these
things
i
am
not
a
business
man
but
it
is
impossible
for
some
reason
or
another
but
of
course
it
is
absurd
good
night
my
dear
overdo
it
in
the
another
week
passed
without
any
particular
news
of
illness
except
that
he
was
getting
weaker
when
one
day
lady
bellamy
appeared
at
the
abbey
house
where
she
had
not
been
since
that
dreadful
christmas
day
angela
felt
quite
cold
when
she
saw
her
enter
and
her
greeting
was
as
cold
as
herself
hope
that
you
bring
me
no
more
bad
news
she
said
angela
except
that
your
cousin
george
is
dying
but
that
is
scarcely
likely
to
distress
am
you
there
is
no
particular
reason
why
you
should
be
you
do
not
like
i
do
not
like
is
a
pity
though
because
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
marry
my
word
lady
bellamy
you
seem
to
be
the
chosen
messenger
of
everything
that
is
wretched
last
time
you
came
to
this
house
it
was
to
tell
me
of
dear
death
and
now
it
is
to
ask
me
to
marry
a
man
whom
i
detest
i
thought
that
i
had
told
both
you
and
him
that
i
will
not
marry
him
i
have
gone
as
near
marrying
as
i
ever
mean
to
in
this
angela
you
are
most
unjust
to
me
do
you
suppose
that
it
was
any
pleasure
to
me
to
have
such
a
sad
duty
to
perform
however
it
is
refreshing
to
hear
you
talk
so
vigorously
clearly
the
loss
of
your
lover
has
not
affected
your
angela
winced
beneath
the
taunt
but
made
no
reply
if
you
will
condescend
to
look
at
the
matter
with
a
single
grain
of
you
will
see
that
circumstances
have
utterly
changed
since
you
refused
to
marry
george
then
heigham
was
alive
poor
fellow
and
then
too
george
wanted
to
marry
you
as
a
wife
now
he
is
merely
anxious
to
marry
you
that
he
may
be
enabled
to
make
reparation
to
your
father
he
is
a
man
you
would
never
be
his
wife
except
in
name
the
grave
would
be
his
only
do
you
not
understand
the
difference
but
do
not
understand
that
whether
in
deed
or
in
name
i
can
not
outrage
my
dead
memory
by
being
for
an
hour
the
wife
of
that
man
do
not
know
that
the
marriage
service
requires
a
woman
to
swear
to
honour
and
obey
till
death
parts
whether
it
be
a
day
or
a
lifetime
away
can
i
even
as
a
mere
form
swear
to
love
when
i
loathe
honour
when
i
despise
obey
when
my
whole
life
would
rise
in
rebellion
against
obedience
what
are
these
estates
to
me
that
i
should
do
such
violence
to
my
conscience
and
my
memories
estates
of
what
use
are
they
to
one
whose
future
lies
in
the
wards
of
a
hospital
or
a
sisterhood
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
marriage
lady
i
must
say
angela
you
do
not
make
much
ado
about
ruining
your
father
to
gratify
your
own
sentimental
whims
it
must
be
a
comfortable
thing
to
have
children
to
help
one
in
old
angela
reflected
on
words
about
her
duty
to
her
father
and
for
the
second
time
that
day
she
winced
beneath
lady
taunt
but
as
she
returned
no
answer
her
visitor
had
no
alternative
but
to
drop
the
subject
and
depart
before
she
went
however
she
had
a
few
words
with
philip
urging
the
serious
state
of
health
and
the
terms
of
his
will
which
prevented
him
from
leaving
the
estates
to
himself
as
a
reason
why
he
should
put
pressure
on
angela
somewhat
but
not
altogether
to
her
surprise
he
refused
in
these
terms
know
to
what
depths
you
have
gone
in
this
business
and
it
is
no
affair
of
mine
to
inquire
but
i
have
kept
to
my
share
of
the
bargain
and
i
expect
you
to
keep
to
yours
if
you
can
bring
about
the
marriage
with
george
well
or
ill
on
the
terms
i
have
agreed
upon
with
him
i
shall
throw
no
obstacle
in
the
way
but
as
for
my
trying
to
force
angela
into
it
i
should
never
take
the
responsibility
of
doing
so
nor
would
she
listen
to
me
if
she
speaks
to
me
on
the
subject
i
shall
point
out
how
the
family
will
be
advantaged
and
leave
the
matter
to
her
further
i
will
not
chapter
lii
three
days
after
her
conversation
with
lady
bellamy
angela
received
the
following
letter
hall
roxham
may
cousin
angela
kind
and
devoted
friend
lady
bellamy
has
told
me
that
she
has
spoken
to
you
on
a
subject
which
is
very
near
to
my
heart
and
that
you
have
distinctly
declined
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
of
course
i
know
that
the
matter
lies
entirely
within
your
own
discretion
but
i
still
venture
to
lay
the
following
points
before
you
there
have
i
am
aware
been
some
painful
passages
between
us
which
under
present
circumstances
had
much
better
be
forgotten
so
first
i
ask
you
to
put
them
quite
out
of
your
mind
and
to
judge
of
what
i
have
to
propose
from
a
very
different
point
of
view
write
angela
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
it
is
true
since
unfortunately
my
health
will
not
allow
me
to
ask
you
in
person
but
it
is
a
very
different
offer
from
that
which
i
made
you
in
the
lane
when
you
so
bitterly
refused
me
now
i
am
solely
anxious
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
in
order
that
i
may
be
enabled
to
avoid
the
stringent
provisions
of
your
will
which
whilst
forbidding
me
to
leave
these
estates
back
to
your
father
or
his
issue
fortunately
does
not
forbid
a
fictitious
sale
and
the
settlement
of
the
sum
or
otherwise
but
i
will
not
trouble
you
with
these
legal
details
short
i
supplanted
your
father
in
youth
and
i
am
now
anxious
to
make
every
reparation
in
my
power
and
at
present
i
am
quite
unable
to
make
any
independently
of
this
it
pains
me
to
think
of
the
estate
passing
away
from
the
old
stock
and
i
should
like
to
know
that
you
who
have
been
the
only
woman
whom
i
have
felt
true
affection
for
will
one
day
come
into
possession
of
it
of
course
as
you
understand
the
marriage
would
be
but
a
and
if
as
i
am
told
you
object
to
its
being
gone
through
with
the
ceremonies
of
the
church
it
could
be
made
equally
legal
at
a
registry
office
please
understand
angela
that
i
do
not
wish
to
press
you
it
is
for
you
to
judge
only
you
must
judge
quickly
for
i
am
a
dying
man
and
am
anxious
to
get
this
matter
off
my
mind
one
way
or
other
in
order
that
i
may
be
able
to
give
it
fully
to
the
consideration
of
subjects
of
more
vital
importance
to
one
in
my
condition
than
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
dear
cousin
angela
yours
you
have
your
father
to
consider
in
this
matter
as
well
as
the
receipt
of
this
letter
plunged
angela
into
the
greatest
distress
of
mind
it
was
couched
in
a
tone
so
courteous
and
so
moderate
that
it
carried
with
it
conviction
of
its
sincerity
and
truth
if
she
only
had
been
concerned
she
would
not
long
have
hesitated
but
the
idea
of
her
duty
to
her
father
rose
up
before
her
like
a
cloud
what
was
her
true
duty
under
the
circumstances
there
was
the
rub
she
took
the
letter
to
fraser
and
asked
his
advice
he
read
it
carefully
and
thought
a
long
while
before
he
answered
the
idea
of
angela
being
united
to
anybody
in
marriage
even
as
a
matter
of
form
was
naturally
abominable
to
him
but
he
was
far
too
honourable
and
conscientious
a
man
to
allow
his
personal
likes
or
dislikes
to
interfere
with
whatever
he
considered
to
be
his
duty
but
in
the
end
he
found
it
impossible
to
give
any
fixed
opinion
dear
he
said
that
i
can
suggest
is
that
you
should
take
it
to
your
father
and
hear
what
he
has
got
to
say
after
all
it
is
he
who
must
have
your
true
welfare
most
at
heart
it
was
into
his
hands
that
i
heard
your
mother
in
peculiarly
solemn
words
consign
you
and
your
interests
take
it
to
your
father
dear
there
is
no
counsel
like
that
of
a
had
fraser
been
the
father
this
would
doubtless
have
been
true
enough
but
though
he
had
known
him
for
so
many
years
and
was
privy
to
much
of
his
history
he
did
not
yet
understand
philip
caresfoot
his
own
open
and
guileless
nature
did
not
easily
suspect
evil
in
another
more
especially
when
that
other
was
the
father
of
her
whom
he
looked
upon
as
the
earthly
incarnation
of
all
that
was
holy
and
pure
angela
sighed
and
from
doubt
obeyed
from
duty
she
handed
the
letter
to
philip
without
a
a
word
he
read
it
want
your
opinion
father
she
said
wish
to
do
what
is
right
you
know
how
painful
what
has
happened
has
been
for
me
you
if
you
do
not
know
you
must
have
completely
shattered
my
life
is
as
for
this
marriage
the
whole
thing
is
repugnant
to
me
personally
i
had
rather
sacrifice
fifty
properties
than
go
through
it
but
i
know
that
i
ought
to
think
of
others
fraser
tells
me
that
it
is
my
duty
to
consult
you
that
you
will
naturally
have
my
interest
most
at
heart
that
it
was
into
your
hands
and
to
your
care
that
my
mother
consigned
me
on
her
deathbed
she
clasped
her
hands
and
looked
him
full
in
the
face
with
her
earnest
fraser
is
right
it
must
be
for
you
to
decide
i
will
trust
you
entirely
and
leave
the
burden
of
decision
to
your
honour
and
generosity
only
i
say
spare
me
if
you
philip
rose
and
went
to
look
out
of
the
window
that
he
might
hide
the
evident
agitation
of
his
face
and
the
tremor
of
his
limbs
he
felt
that
the
crucial
moment
had
come
all
his
poor
sophistry
all
his
miserable
shuffling
and
attempts
to
fix
the
responsibility
of
his
acts
on
others
had
recoiled
upon
his
own
head
she
had
come
to
him
and
laid
the
burden
on
his
heart
what
should
he
answer
for
a
moment
the
with
him
they
were
only
good
angels
gained
the
upper
hand
and
he
was
about
to
turn
and
look
her
in
the
then
he
felt
he
could
have
looked
her
in
the
bid
her
have
nothing
to
do
with
george
and
his
proposals
but
even
in
the
act
of
turning
to
obey
the
impulse
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
roof
of
isleworth
hall
which
standing
on
an
eminence
could
easily
be
seen
from
the
abbey
house
and
his
mind
quicker
than
the
eye
flew
to
the
outlook
place
upon
that
roof
where
he
had
so
often
climbed
as
a
boy
and
surveyed
the
fair
champaign
country
beyond
it
meadow
and
wood
fallow
and
cornland
all
of
which
were
for
him
involved
in
that
answer
he
did
not
stop
turning
quick
is
the
working
of
the
changed
the
nature
of
his
answer
the
real
presence
of
the
demon
of
greed
chased
away
the
poor
angelic
shadows
would
not
be
much
of
a
sacrifice
for
you
angela
to
go
through
this
form
he
is
a
dying
man
and
you
need
not
even
change
your
name
the
lands
are
mine
by
right
and
will
be
yours
it
will
break
my
heart
to
lose
them
after
all
these
years
of
toiling
to
save
enough
to
buy
them
but
i
do
not
wish
to
force
you
in
short
i
leave
the
matter
to
your
generosity
as
you
would
have
left
it
to
suppose
that
i
were
to
marry
my
cousin
george
and
he
were
not
to
die
after
all
what
would
be
my
position
then
you
must
clearly
understand
that
to
save
us
all
from
starvation
i
would
never
be
his
need
not
trouble
yourself
with
the
question
he
is
a
dead
man
in
two
time
he
will
be
in
the
family
she
bowed
her
head
and
left
him
with
his
hot
and
glowing
greed
behind
which
crept
a
terror
next
morning
george
caresfoot
received
the
following
letter
abbey
may
cousin
george
reply
to
your
letter
i
must
tell
you
that
i
am
willing
to
go
through
the
form
of
marriage
with
a
not
in
order
to
enable
you
to
carry
out
the
property
arrangements
you
wish
to
make
you
must
however
clearly
understand
that
i
do
not
do
this
on
my
own
account
but
simply
and
solely
to
benefit
my
father
who
has
left
the
matter
to
my
i
must
ask
you
as
a
preliminary
step
to
make
a
copy
of
and
sign
the
enclosed
letter
addressed
to
me
our
lives
are
in
the
hand
of
god
and
it
is
possible
that
you
might
be
restored
to
health
in
such
an
event
however
improbable
it
may
seem
it
can
not
be
made
too
plain
that
i
am
not
and
have
never
in
any
sense
undertaken
to
be
your
wife
yours
the
enclosure
ran
as
follows
george
caresfoot
hereby
solemnly
promise
before
god
that
under
no
possible
circumstance
will
i
attempt
to
avail
myself
of
any
rights
over
my
cousin
angela
caresfoot
and
that
i
will
leave
her
as
soon
as
the
formal
ceremony
is
concluded
and
never
again
attempt
to
see
her
except
by
her
own
wish
the
marriage
being
only
contemplated
in
order
to
enable
me
to
carry
out
certain
business
arrangements
which
in
view
of
the
failing
state
of
my
health
i
am
anxious
to
enter
this
letter
and
its
curious
enclosure
surely
the
oddest
marriage
contract
which
was
ever
penned
george
trembling
with
excitement
thrust
into
the
hands
of
lady
bellamy
she
read
them
with
a
dark
smile
bird
is
springed
she
said
quietly
has
been
a
close
thing
but
i
told
you
that
i
should
not
fail
as
i
have
warned
you
of
what
will
follow
your
success
sign
this
return
chapter
liii
by
return
of
post
angela
received
her
strange
agreement
duly
copied
and
signed
and
after
this
the
preparations
for
the
marriage
went
on
rapidly
but
where
such
a
large
transaction
is
concerned
as
the
sale
of
between
three
and
four
thousand
acres
of
land
copyhold
and
freehold
together
with
sundry
and
the
lordship
of
six
manors
things
can
not
be
done
in
a
minute
both
george
and
philip
and
their
respective
john
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
their
best
to
expedite
matters
but
unfortunately
some
legal
difficulty
arose
in
connection
with
the
transfer
and
who
can
hurry
the
ponderous
and
capricious
machinery
of
the
law
at
length
it
became
clear
to
all
concerned
except
angela
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
marriage
to
take
place
before
the
eighth
of
june
and
it
also
became
clear
that
that
was
the
last
possible
day
on
which
it
could
take
place
george
begged
philip
by
letter
being
too
ill
to
come
and
see
him
to
allow
the
marriage
to
be
gone
through
with
at
once
and
have
the
business
transactions
finished
afterwards
but
to
this
philip
would
not
consent
the
he
said
must
be
in
his
possession
before
it
took
place
otherwise
he
would
have
no
marriage
george
had
therefore
no
option
but
to
accept
his
terms
when
angela
was
told
of
the
date
fixed
for
the
would
not
allow
the
word
marriage
to
be
mentioned
in
connection
with
at
first
created
considerable
consternation
by
quietly
announcing
that
she
would
not
have
it
performed
until
the
tenth
of
june
at
last
however
when
matters
were
growing
serious
and
when
she
had
treated
all
the
pressure
that
it
was
possible
to
put
upon
her
with
quiet
as
usual
her
father
declined
to
interfere
but
contented
himself
with
playing
a
strictly
passive
suddenly
of
her
own
mere
motion
abolished
the
difficulty
by
consenting
to
appear
before
the
registrar
on
the
eighth
of
june
as
george
wished
her
reasons
for
having
objected
to
this
date
in
the
first
instance
will
be
easily
guessed
it
was
the
day
before
the
anniversary
of
departure
an
anniversary
which
it
was
her
fancy
to
dedicate
solely
to
his
memory
but
as
the
delay
she
could
not
altogether
understand
put
others
to
great
inconvenience
and
as
state
of
health
had
become
such
as
to
render
postponement
even
for
a
couple
of
days
of
doubtful
expediency
and
as
moreover
she
decided
on
reflection
that
she
could
better
give
her
thoughts
to
her
dead
lover
when
she
had
gone
through
with
the
grim
farce
that
hung
over
her
she
suddenly
changed
her
mind
occasionally
they
brought
her
documents
to
sign
and
she
signed
them
without
a
question
but
on
the
whole
she
treated
the
affair
with
considerable
apathy
the
truth
being
that
it
was
repugnant
to
her
mind
which
she
preferred
to
occupy
with
other
and
very
different
thoughts
so
she
let
it
go
she
knew
that
she
was
going
to
do
a
thing
which
was
dreadful
to
her
because
she
believed
it
to
be
her
duty
but
she
comforted
herself
with
the
reflection
that
she
was
amply
secured
against
all
possible
contingencies
by
her
previous
agreement
with
george
knowledge
of
the
of
her
country
and
of
what
constituted
a
legal
document
was
not
extensive
for
this
same
reason
because
it
was
distasteful
she
had
never
said
anything
of
her
contemplated
marriage
to
pigott
and
it
was
quite
unknown
in
the
neighbourhood
since
the
miss
lee
scandal
and
his
consequent
disinheritance
nobody
had
visited
philip
caresfoot
and
those
who
took
interest
in
him
or
his
affairs
were
few
indeed
the
matter
had
been
kept
a
dead
secret
but
on
the
seventh
of
june
being
the
day
previous
to
the
ceremony
angela
went
down
to
her
cottage
and
told
her
what
was
about
to
be
done
suppressing
however
from
various
motives
all
mention
of
her
agreement
with
george
it
added
to
her
depression
to
find
that
pigott
was
unaccountably
disturbed
at
the
news
miss
she
said
to
think
that
i
be
able
to
call
you
that
no
got
nothing
in
particular
to
say
agin
it
seeing
that
sure
enough
the
as
i
has
on
good
authority
from
my
own
cousin
her
that
does
the
washing
up
at
the
hall
and
mighty
bad
she
does
it
begging
of
her
pardon
for
the
disparagement
and
so
he
trouble
you
for
long
and
somehow
it
do
seem
as
though
you
got
no
choice
left
in
the
matter
just
as
though
everybody
and
everything
was
pushing
you
into
it
but
miss
somehow
i
like
it
to
be
plain
a
marriage
as
no
marriage
altogether
natural
like
and
in
an
office
too
along
with
a
man
as
you
would
not
touch
with
a
pair
of
tongs
and
that
man
on
his
last
leg
right
down
sorry
if
i
makes
you
feel
uncomfortable
dearie
but
bless
me
i
know
how
it
is
but
when
a
thing
sticks
in
my
mind
as
bound
to
hawk
it
up
as
though
it
were
a
bone
in
my
like
it
any
more
than
you
do
nurse
but
perhaps
you
understand
all
about
the
property
being
concerned
and
about
its
having
to
pass
away
from
my
father
if
i
do
this
i
care
nothing
about
the
property
but
he
left
it
to
generosity
arthur
is
dead
and
he
left
it
to
generosity
nurse
what
could
i
do
miss
acting
according
to
what
you
thinks
right
and
due
to
your
father
which
is
more
nor
i
does
and
poor
dead
arthur
up
in
heaven
there
will
make
a
note
of
that
there
no
manner
of
doubt
and
somehow
it
do
seem
that
things
be
allowed
to
go
wrong
with
you
my
dear
seeing
how
of
yourself
and
of
your
wishes
to
benefit
this
conversation
did
not
tend
to
put
angela
into
better
spirits
but
she
felt
that
it
was
now
too
late
to
recede
whilst
angela
was
talking
to
pigott
sir
john
and
lady
bellamy
were
paying
a
call
at
isleworth
they
found
george
lying
on
the
sofa
in
the
in
which
though
it
was
the
first
week
in
june
a
fire
was
burning
on
the
hearth
he
bore
all
the
signs
of
a
man
in
the
last
stage
of
consumption
the
hollow
cough
the
emaciation
and
the
hectic
hue
upon
his
face
all
spoke
with
no
uncertain
voice
caresfoot
you
scarcely
look
like
a
bridegroom
i
must
say
said
little
sir
john
looking
as
pleased
as
though
he
had
made
an
eminently
cheerful
remark
but
i
am
stronger
than
i
look
marriage
will
cure
will
it
then
you
will
be
signally
croak
bellamy
i
am
happy
is
fire
dancing
along
my
veins
just
think
this
time
angela
will
be
my
legal
wife
you
appear
to
have
given
a
good
price
for
the
privilege
if
what
anne
tells
me
is
correct
to
sell
the
isleworth
estates
for
fifty
thousand
is
to
sell
them
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
less
than
they
are
worth
consequently
the
girl
costs
you
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
long
figure
that
for
one
you
are
a
fellow
bellamy
you
understand
that
there
is
a
positive
delight
in
ruining
oneself
for
the
woman
one
loves
and
then
think
how
she
will
love
me
when
she
comes
to
understand
what
she
has
cost
me
i
can
see
her
now
she
will
come
and
kiss
you
kiss
me
of
her
own
free
say
you
are
a
noble
fellow
george
you
are
a
lover
that
any
woman
may
be
proud
of
no
price
was
too
heavy
for
yes
that
is
what
she
will
say
that
sort
of
thing
you
sir
merry
little
eye
twinkled
with
inexpressible
amusement
and
his
full
lips
curled
with
unutterable
contempt
are
counting
your
kisses
before
they
are
paid
for
she
said
philip
come
here
this
afternoon
to
sign
the
deeds
they
are
in
the
next
room
will
you
come
and
see
them
i
will
will
you
come
john
thank
you
i
wish
to
be
treated
to
any
more
of
your
omens
i
have
long
ago
washed
my
hands
of
the
whole
business
i
will
stop
here
and
read
the
they
went
out
george
leaning
on
lady
arm
no
sooner
had
they
gone
than
sir
john
put
down
the
and
listened
intently
then
he
rose
and
slipped
the
bolt
of
that
door
which
opened
into
the
hall
thereby
halving
his
chances
of
interruption
next
listening
at
every
step
his
round
face
which
was
solemn
enough
now
stretched
forward
and
looking
for
all
the
world
like
that
of
some
whiskered
puss
advancing
on
a
he
crept
on
tiptoe
to
the
iron
safe
in
the
corner
of
the
room
arrived
there
he
listened
again
and
then
drew
a
little
key
from
his
pocket
and
inserted
it
in
the
lock
it
turned
without
difficulty
murmured
sir
john
now
comes
the
taking
another
key
he
inserted
it
in
the
lock
of
the
subdivision
it
would
not
turn
more
chance
he
said
as
he
tried
a
second
and
open
came
the
lid
rapidly
he
extracted
two
thick
bundles
of
letters
they
were
in
lady
handwriting
then
he
relocked
the
subdivision
and
the
safe
itself
and
put
the
keys
away
in
his
trousers
and
the
packets
in
his
pockets
one
in
each
that
they
might
not
bulge
suspiciously
next
he
unbolted
the
door
and
returning
gave
way
to
paroxysms
of
exultation
too
deep
for
words
last
he
said
stretching
his
fat
little
fist
towards
the
room
where
george
was
with
lady
bellamy
last
after
twenty
years
of
waiting
you
are
in
my
power
my
lady
time
brought
its
revenge
and
if
before
you
are
hours
older
you
do
not
make
acquaintance
with
a
bitterness
worse
than
death
then
my
name
is
not
john
bellamy
i
will
repay
you
every
jot
and
with
interest
too
my
lady
then
he
calmed
himself
and
ringing
a
bell
told
the
servant
to
tell
lady
bellamy
that
he
had
walked
on
home
when
an
hour
and
a
half
later
she
reached
rewtham
house
she
found
that
her
husband
had
been
suddenly
summoned
to
london
on
a
matter
of
business
that
night
in
her
desolation
angela
cast
herself
upon
the
floor
with
outstretched
arms
and
wept
for
her
dead
lover
and
for
the
shame
which
overshadowed
her
and
the
moon
travelling
up
the
sky
struck
her
shining
coldly
on
her
snowy
robe
and
rounded
on
the
stormy
gold
of
her
loosed
all
the
room
with
light
till
the
white
floor
gleamed
like
a
silver
shrine
and
she
lay
there
a
weeping
saint
then
she
rose
and
crept
to
such
rest
as
utter
weariness
of
body
and
mind
can
give
all
that
night
too
george
caresfoot
paced
up
and
down
up
and
down
the
length
of
his
great
room
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
windows
which
commanded
bratham
like
that
of
some
caged
tiger
on
a
desired
prey
he
kept
muttering
till
the
first
ray
of
the
rising
sun
fell
upon
his
wasted
form
and
then
bathing
his
thin
hands
in
its
beams
he
sank
down
exhausted
crying
exultingly
but
that
night
lady
bellamy
sat
at
an
open
window
rising
continually
to
turn
her
dark
eyes
upon
the
starry
heavens
above
her
is
of
no
use
she
said
at
last
knowledge
fails
me
my
calculations
are
baffled
by
a
quantity
i
can
not
trace
i
am
face
to
face
with
a
combination
that
i
can
not
solve
let
me
try
once
more
ah
supposing
that
the
unknown
quantity
is
a
directing
will
which
at
the
crisis
shatters
laws
and
overrides
even
the
immutability
of
the
unchanging
stars
i
have
heard
of
such
a
thing
let
me
change
the
positions
of
our
opposing
planets
and
then
see
it
would
all
be
clear
as
day
george
vanishes
that
i
knew
before
she
sails
triumphant
through
overshadowing
influences
towards
a
silver
sky
and
i
is
it
death
that
awaits
me
no
but
some
great
change
there
the
pale
light
of
my
fading
star
would
fall
into
her
bright
track
bah
my
science
fails
i
can
no
longer
prophesy
my
knowledge
only
tells
me
of
great
events
of
what
use
is
such
knowledge
as
that
well
come
what
may
fate
will
find
one
spirit
that
does
not
fear
him
as
for
this
and
she
pointed
towards
the
symbols
and
calculations
have
done
with
it
henceforth
i
will
devote
myself
to
the
only
real
powers
which
can
enlighten
us
yet
there
is
humiliation
in
failure
after
so
many
years
of
study
it
is
folly
to
follow
a
partial
truth
of
which
we
miss
the
keynote
though
we
sometimes
blunder
on
its
chapter
liv
the
arrangement
for
the
morrow
was
that
angela
and
her
father
were
to
take
a
fly
to
roxham
where
the
registry
office
was
and
whither
george
was
also
to
be
conveyed
in
a
close
carriage
that
the
ceremony
was
then
to
be
gone
through
after
which
the
parties
were
to
separate
and
return
to
their
respective
homes
fraser
had
been
asked
to
attend
but
had
excused
himself
from
doing
so
in
pursuance
of
this
programme
angela
and
her
father
left
the
abbey
house
about
ten
and
drove
in
silence
to
the
town
strange
as
it
may
seem
angela
had
never
been
in
a
town
before
and
in
the
curious
condition
of
her
mind
the
new
sight
of
busy
streets
interested
her
greatly
and
served
to
divert
her
attention
till
they
reached
the
door
of
the
office
she
alighted
and
was
shown
with
philip
into
a
and
here
for
some
unexplained
reason
a
great
fear
took
hold
of
her
a
terror
of
this
ceremony
which
now
loomed
large
and
before
her
she
said
suddenly
after
a
moment
of
irresolution
am
going
home
i
will
not
go
on
with
this
can
you
mean
angela
mean
what
i
say
i
never
realized
how
dreadful
it
all
was
till
now
it
has
come
upon
me
like
a
revelation
come
i
am
be
a
fool
you
forget
that
george
will
be
here
in
a
minute
and
that
the
settlements
are
all
he
can
go
back
again
and
the
settlements
can
be
torn
up
i
will
not
go
on
with
philip
was
by
this
time
almost
beside
himself
with
anxiety
after
having
thus
with
thought
and
toil
and
by
the
aid
of
a
blessed
chance
lifted
this
delicious
cup
to
his
lips
was
it
to
be
dashed
from
him
were
the
sweet
dreams
so
near
approaching
to
realization
in
which
he
had
been
wrapped
for
so
many
days
all
to
be
dissipated
into
thin
air
was
he
to
lose
the
land
after
all
after
he
had
how
yellow
for
alas
the
sale
depended
on
the
marriage
it
could
not
be
neither
fate
nor
angela
could
be
so
cruel
he
turned
upon
her
with
the
boldness
of
despair
you
must
not
go
on
like
this
after
having
agreed
to
the
thing
of
your
own
free
will
think
of
what
it
involves
for
me
if
you
refuse
to
marry
him
now
at
the
last
moment
i
shall
lose
the
isleworth
estates
heavens
to
think
that
so
much
property
should
be
dependent
upon
the
mere
whim
of
a
girl
can
not
you
have
a
little
consideration
for
others
beside
yourself
do
you
really
mean
to
sacrifice
the
hopes
of
my
whole
life
to
throw
away
the
only
opportunity
i
can
ever
have
of
righting
my
wrongs
in
order
to
gratify
a
sentimental
whim
for
sake
think
a
little
first
before
you
sacrifice
me
you
promised
to
do
never
before
had
angela
seen
her
father
so
strongly
excited
he
was
positively
shaking
with
agitation
she
looked
at
him
steadily
and
with
such
contempt
that
even
in
his
excitement
he
quailed
before
her
well
then
i
will
carry
out
my
promise
dreadful
as
it
is
to
me
but
remember
that
it
is
only
because
you
beg
it
and
that
the
responsibility
of
its
consequences
must
always
remain
with
you
now
are
you
satisfied
will
get
your
dark
face
assumed
a
look
of
fervent
gratitude
but
before
he
had
time
to
reply
a
messenger
came
to
say
that
was
waiting
her
resolve
once
taken
angela
followed
him
with
an
untroubled
face
into
the
room
where
the
registrar
a
gentleman
neatly
dressed
in
black
was
sitting
at
a
sort
of
desk
here
the
first
thing
her
glance
fell
upon
was
the
person
of
george
caresfoot
although
it
was
now
the
second
week
in
june
he
wore
a
respirator
over
his
mouth
and
a
scarf
round
his
neck
and
coughed
very
much
these
were
the
first
things
she
noticed
the
next
was
that
he
was
much
thinner
so
thin
that
the
stood
out
from
the
level
of
his
face
whilst
the
little
eyes
seemed
to
protrude
giving
to
his
general
appearance
even
with
the
mouth
his
worst
feature
hidden
by
the
respirator
an
unusually
repulsive
look
he
was
leaning
on
the
arm
of
lady
bellamy
who
greeted
angela
with
a
smile
which
the
latter
fancied
had
something
of
triumph
in
it
with
the
exception
of
the
messenger
who
played
the
part
of
clerk
in
this
civil
ceremony
there
was
nobody
else
in
the
room
no
greetings
were
interchanged
and
in
another
moment
angela
was
standing
dressed
in
her
funeral
black
by
side
before
the
registrar
and
the
ceremony
had
begun
but
from
that
moment
although
her
beautiful
face
preserved
its
composure
she
scarcely
saw
or
heard
anything
of
what
was
going
on
it
was
as
though
all
the
streams
of
thought
in
her
brain
had
burst
their
banks
and
mingled
in
a
great
and
turbulent
current
she
was
filled
with
thought
but
could
seize
upon
no
one
idea
whilst
within
her
mind
she
heard
a
sound
as
of
the
continuous
whirring
of
broken
machinery
objects
and
individuals
real
and
imagined
presented
themselves
before
her
mental
vision
expanded
till
they
filled
the
heavens
with
their
bulk
and
then
shrank
and
shrank
and
vanished
into
nothing
the
word
struck
upon
her
ears
and
seemed
to
go
wailing
away
wife
wife
through
all
the
illimitable
halls
of
sound
till
they
were
filled
with
echoes
and
sound
itself
fell
dead
against
the
silence
of
the
stars
it
was
done
she
awoke
to
find
herself
a
married
woman
lady
bellamy
stepped
forward
with
the
same
smile
with
which
she
had
greeted
angela
hovering
about
her
lips
me
congratulate
you
caresfoot
she
said
i
think
i
am
privileged
to
do
so
for
if
i
remember
right
i
was
the
first
to
prophesy
this
happy
event
and
then
dropping
her
voice
so
that
angela
alone
could
hear
her
you
not
remember
that
i
told
you
that
you
would
as
certainly
come
to
the
altar
rails
within
nine
months
with
george
caresfoot
as
you
would
to
your
i
said
that
nine
months
ago
angela
started
as
though
she
had
been
stung
have
been
too
strong
for
me
she
murmured
all
this
is
nothing
but
a
form
a
form
that
can
now
be
again
lady
bellamy
smiled
as
she
answered
of
course
caresfoot
nothing
but
a
eye
fell
upon
the
ring
on
her
finger
she
tore
it
off
this
back
she
said
have
done
with
married
woman
must
wear
a
ring
she
hurled
it
upon
the
floor
just
then
george
and
philip
returned
from
a
little
where
they
had
been
with
the
registrar
who
still
remained
behind
to
sign
the
certificate
george
advanced
upon
his
wife
with
a
dreadful
smile
on
his
features
removing
the
respirator
as
he
came
his
object
was
to
kiss
her
but
she
divined
it
and
caught
her
father
by
the
arm
she
said
me
from
this
you
angela
why
he
is
your
husband
husband
have
you
all
agreed
to
drive
me
mad
lady
bellamy
saw
that
if
something
were
not
done
quickly
there
would
be
a
shocking
scene
which
was
the
last
thing
she
wanted
so
she
seized
george
and
whispered
in
his
ear
after
which
he
followed
her
sulkily
turning
round
from
time
to
time
to
look
at
angela
on
her
way
from
roxham
lady
bellamy
stopped
her
carriage
at
the
telegraph
office
and
went
in
and
wrote
a
telegram
respect
that
woman
and
she
shall
have
her
chance
she
said
as
she
it
previous
to
handing
it
to
the
clerk
three
hours
later
mildred
carr
received
the
following
message
at
madeira
a
to
carr
quinta
carr
madeira
married
her
cousin
this
that
night
lady
bellamy
dined
at
isleworth
with
george
caresfoot
the
dinner
passed
over
in
almost
complete
silence
george
was
evidently
plunged
in
thought
and
could
not
eat
though
he
drank
a
good
deal
lady
bellamy
ate
and
thought
too
after
the
servants
had
gone
she
began
to
speak
want
my
price
george
she
said
do
you
mean

what
i
say

husband

those
letters
as
you
promised
i
am
impatient
to
break

he
hesitated
she
said
in
a
warning
voice
not
dare
to
play
with
me
i
warn
you
that
your
power
over
me
is
not

it

to

he
went
with
a
somewhat
hesitating
step
to
the
iron
safe
in
the
corner
of
the
room
and
opened
it
the
he
opened
the
subdivision
and
rummaged
about
there
for
a
while
at
last
he
looked
up
is
very
curious
anne
he
said
in
a
voice

them

find
them
if
you
believe
me
come
and
look
for
yourself

have
taken
she
advanced
and
did
as
he
said
it
was
evident
that
the
letters
were
not
there
before
when
you
were
ill
you
hid
them
where
have
you
hidden
them
now
hidden
them
anne
i
she
turned
slowly
and
looked
him
full
in
the
eyes
her
own
face
was
ashy
pale
with
fury
but
she
said
never
a
word
her
silence
was
more
terrible
than
words
then
she
raised
her
hands
and
covered
her
eyes
for
a
while
presently
she
dropped
them
and
said
in
a
singularly
soft
voice
is
over
do
you
mean
he
asked
fearfully
for
she
terrified
him
mean
a
great
deal
george
caresfoot
i
mean
that
something
has
snapped
the
bond
which
bound
me
to
you
i
mean
that
i
no
longer
fear
you
that
i
have
done
with
you
use
your
letters
if
you
will
you
can
harm
me
no
more
i
have
passed
out
of
the
region
of
your
influence
out
of
the
reach
of
your
revenge
i
look
on
you
now
and
wonder
what
the
link
was
between
us
for
there
was
a
mysterious
link
that
i
can
not
tell
but
this
i
can
tell
you
i
have
let
go
your
hand
and
you
are
going
to
fall
down
a
great
precipice
george
a
precipice
of
which
i
can
not
see
the
foot
yes
it
is
right
that
you
should
cower
before
me
now
i
have
cowered
before
you
for
more
than
twenty
years
you
made
me
what
i
am
i
am
going
into
the
next
room
now
till
my
carriage
comes
i
did
not
order
it
till
ten
do
not
follow
me
but
before
i
go
i
will
tell
you
something
and
you
know
i
do
not
make
mistakes
you
will
never
sleep
under
this
roof
again
george
caresfoot
and
we
shall
not
meet
again
alive
you
have
had
a
long
day
but
your
hour
has
told
you
that
woman
he
asked
furiously
night
i
read
it
in
the
stars
i
read
it
in
your
and
again
she
looked
at
him
long
and
steadily
as
he
crouched
in
the
chair
before
her
and
then
slowly
left
the
room
after
awhile
he
roused
himself
and
began
to
drink
wine
furiously
her
he
said
as
the
fumes
mounted
into
his
brain
her
she
is
trying
to
frighten
me
with
her
infernal
magic
but
she
i
know
what
she
is
at
but
i
will
be
beforehand
with
and
staggering
under
the
mingled
influence
of
drink
and
excitement
he
rose
and
left
the
house
lady
bellamy
sat
in
the
and
waited
for
her
carriage
at
last
she
heard
the
wheels
upon
the
gravel
then
she
rose
and
rapidly
did
something
to
the
great
lamp
upon
the
table
as
she
shut
the
door
she
turned
will
do
she
said
in
the
hall
she
met
the
servant
coming
to
announce
the
carriage
your
master

she
asked

chapter
lv
outside
the
door
of
the
angela
and
her
father
had
to
make
their
way
through
a
crowd
of
small
boys
who
had
by
some
means
or
other
found
out
that
a
wedding
was
going
on
inside
and
stood
waiting
there
animated
by
the
intention
of
cheering
the
bride
and
the
certain
hope
of
sixpences
but
when
they
saw
angela
her
stately
form
robed
in
black
and
her
sweet
face
betraying
the
anguish
of
her
mind
the
sight
shocked
their
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
and
they
slipped
off
without
a
word
indeed
a
boy
with
a
turn
for
expressive
language
remarked
in
indignation
to
another
of
his
craft
so
soon
as
they
had
recovered
their
spirits
that
a
bill
why
more
like
with
the
plumes
off
and
as
for
the
gal
though
a
her
face
was
as
pale
as
a
angela
never
quite
knew
how
she
got
back
to
the
abbey
house
she
only
remembered
that
she
was
by
herself
in
the
fly
her
father
preferring
to
travel
on
the
box
alone
with
the
coachman
nor
could
she
ever
quite
remember
how
she
got
through
the
remainder
of
that
day
she
was
quite
mazed
but
at
length
it
passed
and
the
night
came
and
she
was
thankful
for
the
night
about
nine
she
went
up
to
her
bedroom
at
the
top
of
the
house
it
had
served
as
a
nursery
for
many
generations
of
caresfoots
indeed
during
the
last
three
centuries
hundreds
of
little
feet
had
pattered
over
the
old
boards
but
the
little
feet
had
long
since
gone
to
dust
and
the
only
signs
of
play
and
merriment
left
about
the
place
were
the
numberless
scratches
nicks
and
letters
cut
in
the
old
panelling
and
even
on
the
beams
which
supported
the
low
ceiling
it
was
a
lonesome
room
for
a
young
girl
or
indeed
for
anybody
whose
nerves
were
not
of
the
strongest
nobody
slept
upon
that
floor
or
in
the
rooms
beneath
it
philip
occupying
a
little
closet
which
joined
his
study
on
the
ground
floor
all
the
other
rooms
were
closed
and
tenanted
only
by
rats
that
made
unearthly
noises
in
their
emptiness
as
for
jakes
and
his
wife
the
only
servants
on
the
place
they
occupied
a
room
over
the
washhouse
which
was
separate
from
the
main
building
angela
was
therefore
practically
alone
in
a
great
house
and
might
have
been
murdered
a
dozen
times
over
without
the
fact
being
discovered
for
hours
this
did
not
however
trouble
her
much
simply
because
she
paid
no
heed
to
the
noises
in
the
house
and
was
singularly
free
from
fear
of
any
kind
on
reaching
her
room
she
sat
down
and
began
to
think
of
arthur
and
as
she
thought
her
mind
grew
clearer
and
more
at
peace
indeed
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
dead
lover
was
near
and
as
though
she
could
distinguish
pulsations
of
thought
which
came
from
him
impinging
on
her
system
and
bringing
his
presence
with
them
it
is
a
common
sensation
and
occurs
to
many
people
of
sensitive
organization
when
asleep
or
thinking
on
some
one
with
whom
they
are
in
a
high
state
of
sympathy
and
doubtless
indicates
some
occult
communication
but
as
it
chanced
it
had
never
before
visited
angela
in
this
form
and
she
abandoned
herself
to
its
influence
with
delight
it
thrilled
her
through
and
through
how
long
she
sat
thus
she
could
not
tell
but
presently
the
communication
whatever
it
was
stopped
as
suddenly
as
though
the
connecting
link
had
been
severed
the
currents
directed
by
her
will
would
no
longer
do
her
bidding
they
could
not
find
their
object
or
frighted
by
some
adverse
influence
recoiled
in
confusion
on
her
brain
several
times
she
tried
to
renew
this
subtle
intercourse
that
was
so
palpable
and
real
and
yet
so
different
from
anything
else
in
the
world
but
failed
then
she
rose
feeling
very
tired
for
those
who
thus
draw
upon
the
vital
energies
must
pay
the
penalty
of
exhaustion
she
took
her
bible
and
read
her
nightly
chapter
and
then
undressed
and
said
her
prayers
praying
with
unusual
earnestness
that
it
might
please
the
almighty
in
his
wisdom
to
take
her
to
where
her
lover
was
her
prayers
done
she
rose
put
on
a
white
dressing
wrapper
and
seating
herself
before
the
glass
unloosed
her
hair
then
she
began
to
brush
it
pausing
presently
to
think
how
arthur
had
admired
its
colour
and
the
ripples
on
it
she
had
been
much
more
careful
of
her
hair
since
then
and
smiled
sadly
to
herself
at
her
folly
for
being
so
thinking
thus
she
fell
into
a
reverie
and
sat
so
still
that
a
great
grey
rat
came
noiselessly
out
of
his
hole
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
advancing
into
the
circle
of
light
round
the
sat
up
on
his
hind
legs
to
see
if
he
was
alone
suddenly
he
turned
and
scuttled
back
to
his
hole
in
evident
alarm
and
at
the
same
second
angela
thought
that
she
heard
a
sound
of
a
different
character
from
those
she
was
accustomed
to
in
the
old
sound
like
the
creaking
of
a
boot
it
passed
however
but
left
an
indefinable
dread
creeping
over
her
and
chilling
the
blood
in
her
veins
she
began
to
expect
something
she
knew
not
what
and
was
fascinated
by
the
expectation
she
would
have
risen
to
lock
the
door
but
all
strength
seemed
to
have
left
her
she
was
paralysed
by
the
near
sense
of
evil
then
came
a
silence
as
intense
as
it
was
lonely
it
was
a
ghastly
moment
her
back
was
towards
the
doorway
for
her
was
immediately
opposite
the
door
which
was
raised
some
four
feet
above
the
level
of
the
landing
and
approached
by
as
many
steps
gradually
her
eyes
became
riveted
on
the
glass
before
her
for
in
it
she
thought
that
she
saw
the
door
move
next
second
she
was
sure
that
it
moving
very
slowly
the
hinges
took
an
age
to
turn
what
could
be
behind
it
at
last
it
was
open
and
in
the
glass
angela
saw
framed
in
darkness
head
and
shoulders
of
george
at
first
she
believed
that
her
mind
deceived
her
that
it
was
an
apparition
no
there
was
no
mistake
but
the
respirator
the
hollow
cough
and
decrepitude
of
the
were
they
with
horror
in
her
heart
she
turned
and
faced
him
seeing
that
he
was
observed
he
staggered
into
the
room
with
a
step
which
was
half
drunken
and
half
jaunty
but
which
belied
the
conflict
of
passions
written
on
his
brow
he
voice
sounded
hoarse
and
hollow
and
was
to
his
words
did
not
expect
me
how
i
got
here
jakes
let
me
in
he
has
got
a
proper
respect
for
marital
rights
has
jakes
you
looked
so
pretty
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
disturb
you
quite
a
romantic
meeting
is
it
not
are
a
dying
man
how
did
you
come
here
my
dear
wife
not
a
bit
of
it
i
am
no
more
dying
than
you
are
i
have
been
ill
it
is
true
but
that
is
only
because
you
have
fretted
me
so
the
dying
was
only
a
little
ruse
to
get
your
consent
all
is
fair
in
love
and
war
you
know
and
of
course
you
never
really
believed
in
that
precious
agreement
that
was
nothing
but
a
bit
of
maidenly
shyness
eh
angela
stood
still
as
a
stone
a
look
of
horror
on
her
face
you
know
what
you
have
cost
me
your
price
was
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
at
least
that
is
what
it
came
to
the
old
shark
it
every
man
who
would
come
down
like
that
for
a
girl
now
is
it
it
shows
a
generous
mind
it
still
she
uttered
not
a
syllable
he
said
changing
his
tone
to
one
of
hoarse
earnestness
look
at
me
like
that
because
even
if
you
are
a
bit
put
out
at
the
trick
i
have
played
you
just
think
it
was
because
i
loved
you
so
much
angela
i
help
it
i
really
it
is
not
every
man
who
would
go
through
all
that
i
have
gone
through
for
you
it
is
no
joke
to
sham
consumption
for
three
months
i
can
tell
you
but
we
will
have
many
a
laugh
over
that
why
you
answer
me
instead
of
standing
there
just
like
the
andromeda
in
my
study
the
simile
was
an
apt
one
the
statue
of
the
girl
awaiting
her
awful
fate
wore
the
same
hopeless
helpless
look
of
vacant
terror
which
was
upon
face
now
but
its
mention
recalled
lady
bellamy
and
the
ominous
incident
in
which
that
statue
had
figured
and
he
hastened
to
drown
recollection
in
action
he
said
will
forgive
me
you
it
was
all
done
for
love
of
and
he
moved
towards
her
as
he
came
she
seemed
to
collect
her
energies
the
fear
left
her
face
and
in
its
stead
there
shone
a
great
and
awful
blaze
of
indignation
her
brush
was
still
in
her
hand
and
as
he
drew
near
she
dashed
it
full
into
his
face
it
was
but
a
light
thing
and
only
staggered
him
but
it
gave
her
time
to
pass
him
and
reach
the
still
open
door
footed
she
fled
like
the
wind
down
the
passages
and
down
the
stairs
uttering
an
oath
he
followed
her
but
as
she
went
she
remembered
that
she
could
not
run
upon
the
gravel
with
her
naked
feet
and
with
this
in
her
mind
she
turned
to
bay
by
a
large
window
that
gave
light
to
the
landing
immediately
opposite
which
was
the
portrait
of
caresfoot
it
was
unbolted
and
with
a
single
movement
of
the
hand
she
flung
it
open
and
stood
panting
by
it
in
the
full
light
of
the
moon
in
another
moment
he
was
upon
her
furious
at
the
blow
and
his
face
contorted
with
passion
she
cried
listen
to
me
before
i
will
allow
you
to
touch
me
with
a
single
finger
i
will
spring
from
here
i
would
rather
thrust
myself
into
the
hands
of
providence
than
into
yours
monster
and
perjured
liar
that
you
are
he
stopped
as
she
bade
him
and
commenced
to
pace
round
and
round
her
in
a
semicircle
glaring
at
her
with
wild
eyes
you
jump
from
there
he
said
will
only
break
your
limbs
it
is
not
high
enough
to
kill
you
you
are
my
wife
you
understand
you
are
my
legal
wife
the
law
is
on
my
side
no
one
can
help
you
no
one
you
are
mine
in
the
sight
of
the
whole
not
yours
in
the
sight
of
god
it
is
to
him
that
i
now
appeal
get
back
she
stretched
out
her
arm
and
with
her
golden
hair
glimmering
in
the
moonlight
her
white
robes
and
the
anger
on
her
face
looked
like
some
avenging
angel
driving
a
fiend
to
hell
he
shrank
away
from
her
and
there
came
a
pause
and
save
for
their
heavy
breathing
stillness
again
fell
upon
the
house
whilst
the
picture
that
hung
above
them
seemed
in
the
half
light
to
follow
them
with
its
fierce
eyes
as
though
it
were
a
living
thing
the
landing
where
they
stood
looked
upon
the
hall
below
at
the
end
of
which
was
study
suddenly
its
door
burst
open
and
philip
himself
passed
through
it
grasping
a
candlestick
in
one
hand
and
some
parchments
in
the
other
his
features
were
dreadful
to
see
resembling
those
of
a
dumb
thing
in
torture
his
eyes
protruded
his
livid
lips
moved
but
no
sound
came
from
them
he
staggered
across
the
hall
with
terror
staring
from
his
face
father
called
angela
but
he
took
no
did
not
even
seem
to
hear
presently
they
heard
the
candlestick
thrown
with
a
clash
upon
the
hall
pavement
then
the
front
door
slammed
and
he
was
gone
and
at
that
moment
a
great
ruddy
glow
shot
up
the
western
sky
then
a
tongue
of
flame
then
another
and
another

a
solemn
laugh

chapter
lvi
arthur
did
not
delay
his
departure
from
madeira
the
morning
following
ball
he
embarked
on
board
a
portuguese
boat
a
very
dirty
craft
which
smelt
of
garlic
and
rancid
oil
and
sailed
for
lisbon
he
arrived
there
safely
and
mooned
about
that
city
for
a
while
himself
a
monument
of
serious
reflections
and
then
struck
across
into
spain
where
he
spent
a
month
or
so
inspecting
the
historical
beauties
of
that
fallen
country
thence
he
penetrated
across
the
pyrenees
into
southern
france
which
was
pleasant
in
the
spring
months
here
he
remained
another
month
meeting
with
no
adventures
worthy
of
any
note
and
improving
his
knowledge
of
the
french
language
tiring
at
last
of
this
he
travelled
to
paris
and
went
to
the
theatres
but
found
his
own
thoughts
too
absorbing
to
allow
of
his
taking
any
keen
interest
in
their
sensationalisms
so
after
a
brief
stay
he
made
his
way
up
to
brittany
and
normandy
and
went
in
for
inspecting
old
castles
and
cathedrals
and
finally
ended
up
his
continental
travels
by
spending
a
week
on
the
island
rock
of
saint
michel
this
place
pleased
him
more
than
any
he
had
visited
he
liked
to
wander
about
among
the
massive
granite
pillars
of
that
noble
ecclesiastical
fortress
and
at
night
to
watch
the
phosphoric
tide
come
rushing
in
with
all
the
speed
of
a
over
the
wide
sands
which
separate
it
from
the
mainland
there
the
day
of
may
found
him
and
he
bethought
him
that
it
was
time
to
return
to
london
and
see
about
getting
the
settlements
drawn
and
ordering
the
wedding
bouquet
to
speak
the
truth
he
thought
more
about
the
bouquet
than
the
settlements
he
arrived
in
london
on
the
first
of
june
and
went
to
see
his
family
lawyer
a
certain
borley
who
had
been
solicitor
to
the
trust
during
his
minority
me
heigham
how
like
your
father
you
have
grown
said
that
legal
gentleman
as
soon
as
arthur
was
ensconced
in
the
chair
chair
that
had
it
been
endowed
with
the
gift
of
speech
could
have
told
some
surprising
stories
seems
only
the
other
day
that
he
was
sitting
there
dictating
the
terms
of
his
will
and
yet
that
was
before
the
crimean
war
more
than
twenty
years
ago
well
my
boy
what
is
it
arthur
thus
encouraged
entered
into
a
rather
blundering
recital
of
the
circumstances
of
his
engagement
borley
did
not
say
much
but
from
his
manner
and
occasional
comments
it
was
evident
that
he
considered
the
whole
story
very
regarding
it
indeed
with
some
suspicion
must
tell
you
frankly
heigham
he
said
at
last
quite
understand
this
business
the
young
lady
no
doubt
is
charming
ladies
looking
at
them
from
my
point
of
view
always
i
say
i
like
your
story
about
her
father
why
did
you
not
tell
me
all
this
before
i
might
then
have
been
able
to
give
you
some
advice
worth
having
or
at
any
rate
to
make
a
few
laid
great
emphasis
on
the
word
arthur
replied
that
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
to
do
so
pity
but
there
is
no
time
for
that
sort
of
thing
now
if
you
think
you
are
going
to
get
married
on
the
tenth
so
i
suppose
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
go
through
with
it
and
await
the
upshot
what
do
you
wish
done
arthur
explained
his
views
which
apparently
included
settling
all
his
property
on
his
bride
in
the
most
absolute
fashion
possible
to
this
borley
forcibly
objected
and
in
the
end
arthur
had
to
give
way
and
make
such
arrangements
as
the
old
gentleman
thought
arrangements
differing
considerably
from
those
proposed
by
himself
this
interview
over
he
had
other
and
pleasanter
duties
to
perform
such
as
ordering
his
wedding
clothes
making
arrangements
with
a
florist
for
the
bridal
bouquet
and
last
but
not
least
having
his
diamonds
as
a
present
for
his
bride
but
still
the
days
went
very
slowly
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
them
he
had
no
relations
to
go
and
see
and
in
his
present
anxious
excited
state
he
preferred
to
avoid
his
friends
and
club
acquaintances
fifth
sixth
seventh
never
did
a
schoolboy
await
the
coming
of
the
day
that
marked
the
advent
of
his
holidays
with
such
intense
anxiety
at
length
the
eighth
of
june
arrived
months
before
he
had
settled
what
his
programme
should
be
on
that
day
his
promise
as
the
reader
may
remember
forbade
him
to
see
angela
till
the
ninth
that
is
at
any
hour
after
twelve
on
the
night
of
the
eighth
or
practically
as
early
as
possible
on
the
following
morning
now
the
earliest
train
would
not
get
him
down
to
roxham
till
eleven
which
would
involve
a
wicked
waste
of
four
or
five
hours
of
daylight
that
might
be
spent
with
angela
so
he
wisely
resolved
to
start
on
the
evening
of
the
eighth
by
a
train
leaving
paddington
at
six
and
reaching
roxham
at
nine
the
day
he
spent
in
signing
the
settlements
finally
interviewing
the
florist
and
giving
him
directions
as
to
forwarding
the
bouquet
which
was
to
be
composed
of
lilies
of
the
valley
and
stephanotis
and
in
getting
the
but
notwithstanding
these
manifold
employments
he
managed
to
be
quarters
of
an
hour
before
his
train
the
longest
minutes
he
ever
spent
he
had
written
to
the
proprietor
of
the
inn
at
rewtham
where
he
had
slept
a
year
ago
the
night
after
he
had
left
isleworth
to
send
a
gig
to
meet
him
at
the
station
and
on
arriving
at
roxham
a
porter
told
him
that
a
trap
was
waiting
for
him
on
emerging
from
the
station
even
in
the
darkness
he
was
able
to
recognize
the
outlines
of
the
identical
vehicle
which
had
conveyed
him
to
the
abbey
house
some
thirteen
months
ago
whilst
the
sound
of
an
ancient
quavering
voice
informed
him
that
the
jehu
was
likewise
the
same
his
luggage
was
soon
bundled
up
behind
and
the
old
nag
departed
into
the
darkness
sam
do
you
remember
me
no
sir
i
rightly
say
how
i
do
wait
a
bit
you
the
gemman
as
travels
in
the
dry
line
and
as
i
seed
the
chambermaid
i
travel
at
present
and
i
have
not
kissed
a
chambermaid
for
some
time
do
you
remember
driving
a
gentleman
over
to
the
abbey
house
a
year
or
so
ago
yes
in
course
i
does
lord
now
and
be
you
he
and
we
seed
old
granddaughter
ah
the
time
that
he
has
damned
me
and
all
so
soft
and
pleasant
like
but
it
was
his
eyes
that
did
the
trick
they
was
awful
just
awful
and
you
gave
me
crown
you
did
but
somehow
i
thought
i
heard
summat
about
you
sir
but
i
rightly
remember
what
it
be
my
head
not
being
so
good
as
it
used
you
heard
what
i
was
going
to
be
married
i
think
how
as
it
was
that
never
mind
me
have
you
seen
miss
young
lady
you
saw
the
day
you
drove
me
to
the
abbey
about
lately
arthur
waited
for
the
old
lingering
answer
with
all
his
heart
upon
his
lips
yes
sir
that
i
have
i
saw
her
this
morning
driving
through
the
roxham
how
did
she
look
bit
pale
i
thought
sir
but
well
enough
and
wonnerful
arthur
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
he
felt
like
a
man
who
has
just
come
scatheless
through
some
horrible
crisis
and
once
more
knows
the
sweet
sensation
of
safety
what
a
load
the
old
words
had
lifted
from
his
mind
in
his
active
imagination
he
had
pictured
all
sorts
of
evils
which
might
have
happened
to
angela
during
his
year
of
absence
lovers
are
always
prone
to
such
imaginings
and
not
altogether
without
reason
for
there
would
seem
to
be
a
special
power
of
evil
that
devotes
itself
to
the
derangement
of
their
affairs
and
the
ingenious
disappointment
of
their
hopes
but
now
the
vague
dread
was
gone
angela
was
not
spirited
away
or
dead
and
to
know
her
alive
was
to
know
her
faithful
as
they
drove
along
the
old
ostler
continued
to
volunteer
various
scraps
of
information
which
fell
upon
his
ears
unheeded
till
presently
his
attention
was
caught
by
the
name
caresfoot
about
him
he
asked
quickly
be
they
do
of
them
the
one
him
as
lives
up
at
the
hall
fellow
said
arthur
feeling
quite
fond
of
george
in
his
happiness
they
had
by
this
time
reached
the
inn
where
he
had
some
supper
for
old
good
news
had
brought
back
his
appetite
which
of
late
had
not
been
quite
up
to
par
and
then
went
straight
to
his
room
that
faced
towards
the
abbey
house
it
was
he
noticed
the
same
in
which
he
had
slept
the
year
before
and
looking
at
the
bed
he
remembered
his
dream
and
smiled
as
he
thought
that
the
wood
was
passed
and
before
him
lay
nothing
but
the
flowery
meadows
mildred
carr
too
crossed
his
mind
but
of
her
he
did
not
think
much
not
that
he
was
by
any
means
what
had
happened
had
pained
him
acutely
the
more
so
because
his
own
conscience
told
him
he
had
been
a
fool
he
was
very
sorry
but
love
being
here
below
one
of
the
most
selfish
of
the
passions
he
had
not
time
to
be
sorry
just
then
for
just
on
the
horizon
he
could
distinguish
a
dense
mass
which
was
the
trees
surrounding
the
abbey
house
and
between
the
trees
there
glimmered
a
faint
light
which
might
proceed
from
some
rising
star
or
from
window
he
preferred
to
believe
it
was
the
latter
the
propinquity
made
him
very
happy
what
was
she
doing
he
sitting
by
her
window
and
thinking
of
him
he
would
ask
her
on
the
morrow
it
was
worth
while
going
through
that
year
of
separation
in
order
to
taste
the
joy
of
meeting
it
seemed
like
a
dream
to
think
that
within
hours
he
would
probably
be
husband
and
how
nobody
in
the
world
would
be
able
to
take
her
away
from
him
he
stretched
out
his
arms
towards
her
darling
my
darling
he
cried
aloud
into
the
still
night
darling
my
darling
the
echo
answered
sadly
chapter
lvii
that
night
arthur
dreamed
no
evil
dreams
but
he
thought
he
heard
a
sound
outside
his
door
and
some
one
speak
of
fire
hearing
nothing
more
he
turned
and
went
to
sleep
again
waking
in
the
early
dawn
he
felt
ere
yet
his
senses
fully
came
a
happy
sense
of
something
he
knew
not
what
a
rosy
shadow
of
coming
joy
such
as
will
only
with
more
intensity
fall
upon
our
quickened
faculties
when
death
ended
our
souls
begin
to
stir
as
we
awaken
to
eternity
he
sprang
from
his
bed
and
his
eye
fell
on
a
morocco
case
upon
the
it
contained
the
diamonds
which
he
had
had
as
a
wedding
present
to
angela
they
were
nothing
compared
with
mildred
but
still
extremely
handsome
their
beauty
being
enhanced
by
the
elegance
of
the
setting
which
was
in
the
shape
of
a
snake
with
emerald
head
and
ruby
eyes
so
constructed
as
to
clasp
tightly
round
shapely
throat
the
sight
of
the
jewellery
at
once
recalled
his
present
circumstances
and
he
knew
that
the
long
hour
of
trial
was
was
about
to
meet
angela
having
dressed
himself
as
quickly
as
he
could
he
took
up
the
but
finding
it
too
large
to
stow
away
he
opened
it
and
taking
out
the
necklace
crammed
it
into
his
pocket
thus
armed
he
slipped
down
the
stairs
past
the
open
common
room
where
the
light
shone
through
the
cracks
in
the
shutters
on
a
dismal
array
of
sticky
and
spirit
glasses
down
the
sanded
passage
into
the
village
street
it
was
full
daylight
now
and
the
sun
never
looked
upon
a
lovelier
morning
the
air
was
warm
but
there
was
that
sharp
freshness
in
it
which
is
needful
to
make
summer
weather
perfect
and
which
we
always
miss
by
breakfasting
at
nine
the
sky
was
blue
just
flecked
with
little
clouds
the
dewdrops
sparkled
upon
every
leaf
and
blade
of
grass
touches
of
mist
clung
about
the
hollows
and
the
sweet
breath
of
the
awakened
earth
was
full
of
the
perfect
scent
of
an
english
june
which
is
in
its
way
even
more
delicious
than
the
spicy
odours
of
the
tropics
it
was
a
morning
to
make
sick
men
well
and
men
happy
and
atheists
believers
in
a
creative
hand
how
much
more
then
did
it
fire
pulses
already
bounding
with
youth
and
health
with
an
untold
joy
he
felt
like
a
child
again
so
free
from
care
so
happy
except
that
his
heart
swelled
with
a
love
beyond
the
knowledge
of
children
his
quick
temperament
had
rebounded
from
the
depths
of
unequal
depression
into
which
it
so
often
fell
to
the
heights
of
a
happy
assurance
the
tantalus
cup
was
at
his
lips
at
last
and
he
would
drink
his
full
be
sure
his
eyes
flashed
and
sparkled
his
foot
fell
light
and
quick
as
an
his
brown
cheek
had
he
looked
so
handsome
angela
would
not
forget
her
promise
she
would
be
waiting
for
him
by
the
lake
he
was
sure
of
that
and
thither
he
made
his
way
through
the
morning
sunshine
they
were
happy
moments
presently
he
passed
into
the
parish
of
bratham
and
his
eye
fell
upon
a
neat
red
brick
cottage
a
garden
planted
with
sunflowers
and
a
bright
gravel
path
running
to
the
rustic
gate
he
thought
the
garden
charmingly
and
had
just
entered
a
mental
note
to
ask
angela
who
lived
there
when
the
door
opened
and
a
figure
he
knew
emerged
bearing
a
mat
in
one
hand
and
a
mopstick
in
the
other
he
was
some
way
off
and
at
first
could
not
quite
distinguish
who
it
was
but
before
she
had
come
to
the
gate
he
recognized
pigott
by
this
time
she
had
stepped
into
the
road
and
was
making
elaborate
preparations
to
dust
her
mat
so
that
she
did
not
see
him
till
he
spoke
to
her
are
you
pigott
what
may
you
be
doing
down
here
why
are
you
not
up
at
the
abbey
she
gave
a
cry
and
the
mat
and
mopstick
fell
from
her
hands
heigham
she
said
in
an
awed
voice
that
chilled
his
blood
has
brought
you
back
and
why
do
you
come
to
me
i
never
wronged
are
you
talking
about
i
have
come
to
marry
angela
of
course
we
are
going
to
be
married
then
really
sir
she
married
good
god
laugh
at
me
laugh
upsets
me
why
do
you
shake
so
what
do
you
mean
mean
that
my
angela
her
cousin
george
caresfoot
at
roxham
heaven
forgive
me
for
having
to
tell
it
you
reader
have
you
ever
mortally
wounded
a
head
of
large
game
you
hear
your
bullet
thud
upon
the
living
flesh
and
see
the
creature
throw
up
its
head
and
stagger
for
a
moment
and
then
plunge
forward
with
desperate
speed
crashing
through
bush
and
reeds
as
though
they
were
follow
him
awhile
and
you
will
find
him
standing
quite
still
breathing
in
great
sighs
his
back
humped
and
his
eye
dim
the
gore
trickling
from
his
nostrils
he
is
be
careful
he
means
mischief
before
he
dies
any
great
shock
mental
or
physical
is
apt
to
reduce
man
to
the
level
of
his
brother
beasts
arthur
for
instance
behaved
very
much
like
a
wounded
buffalo
as
soon
as
the
stun
of
the
blow
passed
away
and
the
rending
pain
began
to
make
itself
felt
for
a
few
seconds
he
gazed
before
him
stupid
and
helpless
then
his
face
turned
quite
grey
the
eyes
and
nostrils
gaped
wide
and
a
curious
rigidity
took
possession
of
his
muscles
the
road
he
was
following
led
to
a
branching
lane
the
same
that
angela
was
turning
up
that
misty
christmas
eve
when
she
saw
lady
bellamy
glide
past
in
her
carriage
this
lane
had
in
former
ages
no
doubt
to
judge
from
its
numerous
curves
been
an
ancient
and
it
ran
to
the
little
bridge
over
the
stream
that
fed
the
point
that
by
travelling
as
the
crow
flies
from
cottage
might
be
reached
in
half
the
time
this
fact
arthur
seemed
at
that
dreadful
moment
to
suddenly
realize
more
probably
from
natural
instinct
than
from
any
particular
knowledge
of
the
lay
of
the
land
he
did
not
speak
again
to
pigott
and
she
was
too
frightened
at
his
face
to
speak
to
him
he
only
looked
at
her
but
she
never
forgot
that
look
so
long
as
she
lived
then
he
turned
like
a
mad
thing
and
went
through
the
thick
fence
that
hedged
the
road
and
ran
at
full
speed
towards
the
lake
diverging
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
but
breaking
his
way
without
the
slightest
apparent
difficulty
through
everything
that
opposed
him
very
soon
he
came
to
the
little
bridge
and
here
struck
by
some
new
instinct
he
halted
he
did
not
appear
to
be
out
of
breath
but
he
leaned
on
the
rail
of
the
bridge
and
groaned
like
a
dying
man
his
ghastly
face
made
a
blot
in
the
mimic
scenery
of
the
place
which
was
really
very
pretty
the
bridge
commanded
no
view
for
the
little
creek
it
spanned
and
into
which
the
stream
ran
gave
a
turn
before
it
grew
into
the
neck
of
the
lake
but
it
was
hedged
in
by
greenery
and
the
still
pool
beneath
it
was
starred
with
turning
their
innocent
eyes
up
to
the
blue
sky
and
looking
as
peaceful
as
though
there
were
no
stormy
winds
or
waters
in
the
world
to
toss
them
amongst
these
a
moorhen
had
built
her
nest
and
presently
she
came
clucking
out
right
under
feet
followed
by
ten
or
a
dozen
little
hurrying
black
balls
each
tipped
with
red
she
looked
very
happy
with
her
happy
as
the
lilies
and
the
blue
the
sight
made
him
savage
he
took
up
a
large
stone
that
lay
by
him
and
threw
it
at
her
it
hit
her
on
the
back
and
killed
her
and
arthur
laughed
loud
as
he
watched
her
struggle
and
then
lie
still
while
the
motherless
chicks
hurried
frightened
away
and
yet
since
he
was
a
boy
he
had
never
till
now
wantonly
injured
any
living
creature
presently
the
dead
floated
out
of
sight
and
he
roused
himself
straightened
his
clothes
which
had
been
somewhat
torn
and
deranged
and
with
a
steady
step
and
a
fixed
smile
upon
his
lips
went
forward
no
longer
at
a
run
but
walking
quietly
up
the
path
that
led
to
the
big
oak
and
shaded
glen
in
five
minutes
he
was
there
again
he
paused
and
looked
there
was
something
to
see
on
one
of
the
stone
seats
dressed
in
black
her
face
deathly
pale
her
head
resting
on
her
hand
and
trouble
in
her
eyes
sat
angela
on
the
other
was
her
constant
companion
the
dog
which
he
had
given
her
he
remembered
how
a
little
more
than
a
year
before
she
had
surprised
him
in
the
same
way
and
he
had
looked
upon
her
and
loved
her
he
could
even
smile
at
the
strange
irony
of
fate
that
had
under
such
curiously
reversed
circumstances
brought
him
back
to
surprise
her
to
look
upon
her
and
hate
her
she
moved
uneasily
and
glanced
round
but
he
was
hidden
by
a
bush
then
she
half
rose
paused
irresolutely
and
as
though
struggling
against
something
foolish
sat
determinedly
down
again
when
arthur
had
done
smiling
he
came
forward
a
few
steps
into
the
open
feeling
that
his
face
was
all
drawn
and
changed
as
indeed
it
was
it
was
the
face
of
a
man
of
fifty
his
eyes
were
fire
and
his
heart
was
ice
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
up
with
a
shrinking
in
her
eyes
as
though
she
feared
to
see
something
shrinking
which
turned
first
to
wonder
then
to
dread
then
to
a
lively
joy
and
then
again
to
awe
she
rose
mechanically
with
a
great
gasp
her
lips
parted
as
though
to
speak
but
no
words
came
the
dog
too
saw
him
and
growled
then
ran
up
and
sniffed
and
leaped
upon
him
with
a
yelp
of
joy
he
waved
it
down
and
there
was
something
in
the
gesture
that
frightened
the
beast
it
shrank
behind
him
then
he
spoke
in
a
clear
hard
his
own
voice
she
thought
is
this
true
are
you
no
and
her
voice
came
stealing
to
his
senses
like
forgotten
music
is
yes
alas
but
is
it
really
you
oh
arthur
my
darling
have
you
come
back
to
me
and
she
moved
towards
him
with
outstretched
arms
already
they
were
closing
round
him
and
he
could
feel
her
breath
upon
his
cheek
when
the
charm
broke
and
he
wrenched
himself
free
back
do
not
dare
to
touch
me
do
you
know
what
you
are
the
poor
lost
girl
is
not
fallen
so
low
as
you
she
must
get
her
bread
but
at
any
rate
i
could
have
given
you
bread
what
fresh
from
your
arms
and
ready
to
throw
yourself
into
mine
shame
upon
you
were
you
not
married
yesterday
arthur
have
pity
you
do
not
understand
oh
merciful
pity
what
need
for
pity
were
you
not
married
yesterday
and
he
laughed
bitterly
come
from
far
to
congratulate
the
made
wife
it
is
a
little
odd
though
i
thought
to
marry
you
myself
see
here
was
my
wedding
present
and
he
tore
the
diamond
necklace
from
his
pocket
snake
you
see
a
good
emblem
away
with
it
its
use
is
gone
the
diamonds
went
flashing
through
the
sunlight
and
fell
with
a
little
splash
into
the
lake
are
you
not
sorry
to
see
so
much
valuable
property
wasted
you
have
a
keen
appreciation
of
property
angela
sank
down
on
her
knees
before
him
like
a
broken
lily
her
looks
grew
faint
and
despairing
the
stately
head
bowed
itself
to
his
feet
and
all
the
golden
weight
of
hair
broke
loose
but
he
did
not
pause
or
spare
her
he
ground
his
teeth
no
one
could
have
recognized
in
this
maddened
man
the
pleasant
arthur
of
an
hour
before
his
nature
was
stirred
to
its
depths
and
they
were
deep
miserable
woman
do
not
kneel
to
me
if
it
were
not
unmanly
i
could
spurn
you
with
my
foot
do
you
know
girl
you
who
swore
to
love
me
till
time
had
and
for
all
eternity
you
who
do
love
me
at
this
therein
lies
your
you
have
killed
me
you
have
murdered
my
heart
i
trusted
you
angela
i
trusted
you
i
gave
you
all
my
life
all
that
was
best
in
me
and
now
in
degraded
as
you
must
always
love
you
as
much
as
i
despise
you
even
now
i
feel
that
i
hate
you
and
forget
you
i
love
you
and
i
despise
she
gazed
up
at
him
like
a
dumb
beast
at
its
butcher
she
could
not
speak
her
voice
had
gone
yet
when
i
think
of
it
i
have
something
to
thank
you
for
you
have
cleared
my
mind
of
illusions
you
have
taught
me
what
a
purity
is
worth
you
did
the
thing
well
too
you
did
not
crush
me
by
inches
with
platitudes
bidding
me
forget
you
and
not
think
of
you
any
more
as
though
forgetfulness
were
possible
and
thought
a
tangible
thing
that
one
could
kill
you
struck
home
in
silence
once
and
for
all
thank
you
for
angela
what
are
you
crying
go
back
to
the
brute
whom
you
have
chosen
the
brute
whose
passion
or
whose
money
you
could
prefer
to
me
tell
him
that
they
are
tears
of
happiness
and
let
him
kiss
them
quite
and
nature
gave
way
she
fell
fainting
on
the
grass
then
when
he
saw
that
she
could
not
understand
or
feel
any
more
his
rage
died
and
he
too
broke
down
and
sobbed
great
gasping
sobs
and
the
frightened
dog
crept
up
and
licked
first
her
face
and
then
his
hand
kneeling
down
arthur
raised
her
in
his
arms
and
strained
her
to
his
heart
kissing
her
thrice
upon
the
lips
he
could
not
touch
then
he
placed
her
on
the
seat
leaning
her
weight
against
the
tree
and
motioning
back
the
dog
he
went
his
way
chapter
lviii
arthur
took
the
same
path
by
which
he
had
paths
were
alike
to
him
before
he
had
gone
ten
yards
he
saw
the
figure
of
george
caresfoot
who
appeared
to
have
been
watching
him
in
hand
was
a
for
he
had
ridden
from
the
scene
of
the
fire
and
was
all
begrimed
with
smoke
and
dirt
but
this
arthur
did
not
notice
he
began
and
then
he
hesitated
there
was
a
look
in
eyes
which
he
did
not
like
but
if
george
hesitated
arthur
did
not
he
sprang
at
him
like
a
wild
cat
and
in
a
second
had
him
by
the
throat
and
shoulder
for
a
moment
he
held
him
there
for
in
his
state
of
compressed
fury
george
was
like
a
child
in
his
hands
and
as
he
held
him
a
fierce
and
almost
uncontrollable
desire
took
possession
of
him
to
kill
this
man
to
throw
him
down
and
stamp
the
life
out
of
him
he
conquered
it
however
and
loosed
the
grip
on
his
throat
me
go
shrieked
george
as
soon
as
he
could
get
breath
arthur
cut
short
his
clamours
by
again
compressing
his
he
said
second
ago
i
was
very
near
killing
you
but
i
remember
now
that
after
all
it
is
she
not
you
who
are
chiefly
to
blame
you
only
followed
your
brutal
nature
and
nothing
else
can
be
expected
of
a
brute
very
likely
you
put
pressure
on
her
like
the
cad
that
you
are
but
that
does
not
excuse
her
for
if
she
could
not
resist
pressure
she
is
a
fool
in
addition
to
being
what
she
is
i
look
at
you
and
think
that
soon
will
come
down
to
level
the
level
of
my
successful
rival
to
be
mated
to
a
man
like
you
would
drag
an
angel
down
that
will
be
punishment
enough
now
go
you
cur
he
swung
him
violently
from
him
his
fall
was
broken
by
a
bush
it
was
not
exactly
a
bed
of
roses
but
george
thought
it
safer
to
lie
there
till
his
footsteps
had
grown
did
not
wish
to
bring
him
back
again
then
he
crept
out
of
the
bush
smarting
all
over
indeed
his
frame
of
mind
was
altogether
not
of
the
most
amiable
to
begin
with
he
had
just
seen
his
as
luck
would
have
it
was
the
only
thing
he
had
not
sold
to
philip
and
which
was
also
at
the
moment
uninsured
owing
to
the
confusion
arising
from
the
transfer
of
the
burnt
down
all
its
valuable
contents
too
including
a
fine
collection
of
pictures
and
private
papers
he
by
no
means
wished
to
lose
were
irretrievably
destroyed
nor
was
his
mood
improved
by
the
recollection
of
the
events
of
the
previous
night
or
by
the
episode
of
the
illuminated
as
it
was
by
vigorous
language
or
by
what
he
had
just
witnessed
for
he
had
arrived
in
time
to
see
though
from
a
distance
the
last
act
of
the
interview
between
arthur
and
angela
he
had
seen
him
lift
her
in
his
arms
kiss
her
and
place
her
on
the
stone
seat
but
he
did
not
know
that
she
had
fainted
the
sight
had
roused
his
evil
passions
until
they
raged
like
the
fire
he
had
left
then
arthur
came
out
upon
him
and
he
made
acquaintance
with
the
as
already
described
but
he
was
not
going
to
be
cheated
out
of
his
revenge
the
woman
was
still
left
for
him
to
wreak
it
on
by
the
time
he
reached
angela
her
faculties
were
reawakening
but
though
insensibility
had
yielded
sense
had
not
returned
she
sat
upon
the
stone
seat
upright
indeed
but
rigid
and
grasping
its
angles
with
her
hands
the
dog
had
gone
in
the
undecided
way
common
to
dogs
when
two
people
to
whom
they
are
equally
attached
separate
it
had
at
that
moment
taken
it
into
its
head
to
run
a
little
way
after
arthur
george
marched
straight
up
to
her
livid
with
fury
this
is
how
you
go
on
when
your
husband
is
away
is
it
i
saw
you
kissing
that
young
blackguard
though
i
am
not
good
enough
for
you
what
you
answer
then
it
is
time
that
i
taught
you
went
the
heavy
whip
through
the
air
and
fell
across
her
fair
cheek
that
wake
you
eh
or
must
i
repeat
the
dose
the
pain
of
the
blow
seemed
to
rouse
her
she
rose
her
loosed
hair
falling
round
her
like
a
golden
fleece
and
a
broad
blue
stripe
across
her
ghastly
face
she
stretched
out
her
hands
she
opened
her
great
eyes
and
in
them
blazed
the
awful
light
of
madness
he
was
standing
whip
in
hand
with
his
back
to
the
lake
she
faced
him
a
breathing
beautiful
vengeance
and
in
a
whisper
so
intense
that
the
air
was
full
of
it
commenced
a
rambling
prayer
god
she
said
my
dear
arthur
oh
almighty
father
avenge
our
wrongs
she
paused
and
fixed
her
eyes
upon
him
and
they
held
him
so
that
he
could
not
stir
then
in
strange
contrast
to
the
hissing
whisper
there
broke
from
her
lips
a
ringing
and
unearthly
laugh
that
chilled
him
to
the
marrow
so
they
stood
for
some
seconds
the
sound
of
angry
voices
had
brought
the
bulldog
back
at
full
speed
and
at
the
sight
of
threatening
attitude
it
halted
it
had
always
hated
him
and
now
it
straightway
grew
more
like
a
devil
than
a
dog
the
innate
fierceness
of
the
great
brute
awoke
it
bristled
with
fury
till
each
separate
hair
stood
out
in
knots
against
the
skin
and
saliva
ran
from
its
twitching
jaws
george
did
not
know
that
it
was
near
him
but
wild
eye
fell
upon
it
slowly
raising
her
hand
she
pointed
at
it
behind
you
she
cried
the
sound
of
her
voice
broke
the
spell
that
was
upon
him
give
me
no
more
of
your
nonsense
he
said
and
then
as
much
from
vague
fear
and
rampant
brutality
as
from
any
other
reason
again
struck
her
with
the
whip
next
second
he
was
aware
of
a
tremendous
shock
the
dog
had
seen
the
blow
and
had
instantly
launched
itself
with
all
the
blind
courage
of
its
race
straight
at
the
throat
it
missed
its
aim
however
only
carrying
away
a
portion
of
he
yelled
with
pain
and
struck
at
it
with
the
whip
and
then
began
a
scene
which
in
its
grotesque
horror
beggars
all
description
again
and
again
the
dog
flew
at
him
its
perfect
silence
contrasting
strangely
with
shrieks
of
terror
and
the
shrill
peals
of
horrible
laughter
that
came
hurrying
from
lips
as
she
watched
the
struggle
at
last
the
dog
gripped
the
man
by
the
forearm
and
sinking
its
great
teeth
into
the
flesh
hung
its
weight
upon
it
in
vain
did
george
maddened
by
the
exquisite
pain
dash
himself
and
the
dog
against
the
ground
in
vain
did
he
stagger
round
and
round
the
glen
tearing
at
its
throat
with
his
uninjured
hand
the
brute
hung
grimly
on
presently
there
came
an
end
as
he
reeled
along
howling
for
help
and
dragging
his
fierce
burden
with
him
george
stumbled
over
a
dead
bough
which
lay
upon
the
bank
of
the
lake
and
fell
backwards
into
the
water
exactly
at
the
spot
where
the
foundations
of
the
old
wall
rose
to
within
a
few
inches
of
the
surface
his
head
struck
heavily
against
the
stonework
and
he
and
the
dog
who
would
not
loose
his
grip
lay
on
it
for
a
moment
then
they
rolled
off
together
into
the
deep
pool
the
man
dragging
the
dog
with
him
there
were
a
few
ripples
stained
with
little
red
filaments
a
few
that
marked
the
exhalation
of
his
last
breath
and
spirit
had
left
its
enclosing
body
and
ay
reader
whither
had
it
gone
the
outcry
brought
philip
and
old
jakes
running
down
to
the
lake
they
found
angela
standing
alone
on
the
brink
and
laughing
her
wildest
she
cried
as
they
came
panting
up
bridegroom
cometh
from
his
chamber
and
at
that
moment
some
unreleased
air
within
the
body
brought
it
up
for
an
instant
to
the
surface
so
that
the
torn
and
ghastly
face
and
head
emerged
for
a
second
as
though
to
look
at
them
then
it
sank
again

dog

can
not
catch
me

sold
me

turning
she
fled
with
the
speed
of
the
wind
fraser
had
but
just
come
down
and
was
walking
in
his
garden
when
he
saw
this
dreadful
figure
come
flying
towards
him
with
streaming
hair
she
cried
in
a
voice
which
rang
like
the
wail
of
a
lost
soul
and
fell
on
her
face
at
his
feet
when
she
came
back
to
life
they
found
that
she
was
mad
chapter
lix
the
news
of
george
tragic
death
was
soon
common
property
and
following
as
it
did
so
hard
upon
his
marriage
which
now
was
becoming
known
and
within
a
few
hours
of
the
destruction
of
his
house
by
fire
it
caused
no
little
excitement
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
general
feeling
was
one
of
very
great
regret
it
was
not
george
caresfoot
had
commanded
deference
as
a
rich
man
but
he
certainly
had
not
won
affection
still
his
fate
excited
general
interest
and
sympathy
though
some
people
were
louder
in
their
regrets
over
the
death
of
such
a
plucky
dog
as
aleck
than
over
that
of
the
man
he
killed
but
then
these
had
a
personal
dislike
of
george
when
however
it
came
to
be
rumoured
that
the
dog
had
attacked
george
because
george
had
struck
the
mistress
general
sympathy
veered
decidedly
towards
the
dog
as
some
of
the
true
facts
of
the
case
came
out
namely
that
angela
caresfoot
had
gone
mad
that
her
lover
who
was
supposed
to
be
dead
had
been
seen
in
rewtham
on
the
evening
of
the
wedding
that
the
news
of
death
had
been
concocted
to
bring
about
the
marriage
and
last
but
not
least
that
the
isleworth
estates
had
passed
into
the
possession
of
philip
caresfoot
public
opinion
grew
very
excited
and
the
dog
aleck
was
well
spoken
of
when
sir
john
bellamy
stepped
out
on
the
platform
at
roxham
on
his
return
from
london
that
day
his
practised
eye
saw
at
once
that
something
unusual
had
occurred
a
group
of
county
magistrates
returning
from
quarter
sessions
were
talking
excitedly
together
whilst
waiting
for
their
train
he
knew
them
all
well
but
at
first
they
seemed
inclined
to
let
him
pass
without
speaking
to
him
presently
however
one
of
them
turned
and
spoke
to
him
you
heard
about
this
bellamy
what
caresfoot
is
dead
killed
by
a
bulldog
or
something
they
say
he
was
thrashing
the
girl
he
married
yesterday
his
daughter
with
a
whip
and
the
dog
made
for
him
and
they
both
fell
into
the
water
together
and
were
drowned
the
girl
has
gone
heavens
you
say
so
i
do
though
and
tell
you
what
it
is
bellamy
they
say
that
you
and
your
wife
went
to
madeira
and
trumped
up
a
story
about
her
death
in
order
to
take
the
girl
in
i
tell
you
this
as
an
old
i
certainly
went
to
madeira
and
i
saw
young
heigham
there
but
i
never
trumped
up
any
story
about
his
death
i
never
mentioned
him
to
angela
caresfoot
for
two
reasons
first
because
i
have
not
come
across
her
and
secondly
because
i
understood
that
philip
caresfoot
did
not
wish
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
for
your
sake
but
i
have
just
seen
fraser
and
he
tells
me
that
lady
bellamy
told
the
girl
of
this
young
death
in
his
own
presence
and
what
is
more
he
showed
me
a
letter
they
found
in
her
dress
purporting
to
have
been
written
by
him
on
his
which
your
wife
gave
what
lady
bellamy
has
or
has
not
said
or
done
i
know
nothing
i
have
no
control
over
her
i
should
advise
you
to
look
into
the
business
because
it
will
all
come
out
at
the
inquest
and
they
separated
sir
john
drove
homewards
thoughtful
but
by
no
means
unhappy
the
news
of
agonizing
death
was
balm
to
him
he
only
regretted
that
he
had
not
been
well
out
of
the
way
of
the
dog
up
a
tree
for
see
it
as
soon
as
he
got
home
he
sent
a
message
to
lady
bellamy
to
say
he
wished
to
speak
to
her
then
he
seated
himself
at
his
and
waited
presently
he
heard
his
firm
step
upon
the
stairs
he
rubbed
his
dry
hands
and
smiled
a
half
frightened
wicked
little
smile
last
he
said
now
for
she
entered
the
room
looking
rather
pale
but
calm
and
commanding
as
ever
you
have
come
back
she
said
have
you
heard
the
news
george
caresfoot
is
knew
that
he
was
dead
how
did
he
die
told
you
he
was
dead
one
i
knew
it
i
told
him
he
would
die
last
night
and
i
felt
him
die
this
morning
did
she
kill
him
or
did
arthur
heigham
that
bulldog
flew
at
him
and
he
fell
into
the
i
suppose
angela
set
it
on
i
told
him
that
she
would
win
you
remember
the
picture
falling
in
the
study
at
isleworth
it
has
been
a
true
omen
you
is
mad
the
story
is
all
over
the
country
and
travelling
like
the
letter
you
forged
has
been
found
heigham
was
down
here
this
morning
and
has
gone
again
and
you
lady
bellamy
are
a
disgraced
and
ruined
she
did
not
flinch
a
muscle
know
it
it
is
the
result
of
pitting
myself
against
that
girl
but
pray
sir
john
what
are
you
was
it
not
you
who
devised
the
scheme
are
right
i
did
to
trap
two
fools
anne
i
have
waited
twenty
years
but
you
have
met
your
master
at
lady
bellamy
made
a
slight
exclamation
and
relapsed
into
silence
plot
has
worked
well
already
one
of
you
is
dead
and
for
you
a
fate
is
reserved
that
is
worse
than
death
you
are
henceforth
a
penniless
outcast
left
at
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
wide
yourself
a
pleasure
for
years
i
have
submitted
to
your
contumely
longing
to
be
revenged
waiting
to
be
revenged
you
thought
me
a
fool
i
know
and
compared
with
you
i
am
but
you
do
not
understand
what
an
amount
of
hatred
even
a
fool
is
capable
of
for
twenty
years
lady
bellamy
i
have
hated
you
you
will
never
know
how
much
though
perhaps
what
i
am
going
to
say
may
give
you
some
idea
i
very
well
knew
what
terms
you
were
on
with
george
caresfoot
you
never
took
any
pains
to
hide
them
from
me
you
only
hid
the
proofs
i
soon
discovered
indeed
that
your
marriage
to
me
was
nothing
but
a
blind
that
i
was
being
used
as
a
screen
forsooth
but
your
past
i
could
never
fathom
i
look
like
a
revengeful
man
but
for
all
that
i
have
for
years
sought
many
ways
to
ruin
you
both
yet
from
one
thing
and
another
they
all
failed
till
a
blessed
chance
made
that
blind
passion
the
instrument
of
his
own
destruction
and
put
you
into
my
hands
you
little
thought
when
you
told
me
all
that
story
and
begged
my
advice
how
i
was
revelling
in
the
sense
that
proud
woman
as
you
are
it
must
have
been
an
agony
of
humiliation
for
you
to
have
to
tell
it
it
was
an
instructive
scene
that
it
assured
me
of
what
i
suspected
before
that
george
caresfoot
must
have
you
bound
to
him
by
some
stronger
ties
than
those
of
affection
that
he
must
hold
you
in
a
grip
of
iron
it
made
me
think
too
that
if
by
any
means
i
could
acquire
the
same
power
i
too
should
be
able
to
torture
for
the
first
time
lady
bellamy
looked
up
i
tiring
you
he
said
politely
shall
i
go
on
your
permission
i
will
ring
for
a
glass
of
claret
the
day
is
too
hot
for
sherry
and
he
rang
the
claret
was
brought
and
he
drank
a
glass
remarking
with
an
affectation
of
coolness
that
it
was
a
sound
wine
for
a
pound
a
dozen
then
he
proceeded
first
thing
i
have
to
call
your
attention
to
is
this
arthur
heigham
plot
at
first
it
may
appear
that
i
am
involved
with
you
i
am
not
there
is
not
now
that
george
caresfoot
is
dead
one
tittle
of
evidence
against
me
except
your
own
and
who
will
believe
you
are
inculpated
up
to
the
eyes
you
delivered
the
forged
letter
i
can
prove
that
you
cozened
the
ring
out
of
heigham
and
you
told
philip
there
is
no
escape
for
you
and
i
have
already
taken
an
opportunity
to
renounce
any
responsibility
for
your
acts
at
the
inquest
i
shall
appear
to
give
evidence
against
you
and
then
i
shall
abandon
you
to
your
that
all
woman
have
your
letters
she
sprang
up
with
a
little
scream
and
stood
over
him
with
dilated
eyes
sir
john
leaned
back
in
his
chair
rubbed
his
hands
and
watched
her
tortured
face
with
evident
satisfaction
you
may
well
scream
he
said
i
not
only
possess
them
but
i
have
read
and
them
i
know
all
your
story
the
name
of
the
husband
you
deserted
and
of
the
child
who
died
of
your
neglect
i
have
even
sent
an
agent
to
identify
the
localities
yes
you
may
well
scream
for
i
have
read
them
all
and
really
they
are
most
instructive
documents
and
romantic
enough
for
a
novel
such
fire
such
passionate
invective
such
wild
despair
but
since
i
learnt
how
and
why
you
married
me
i
will
tell
you
what
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
do
i
am
going
after
the
inquest
to
turn
you
out
of
this
house
and
give
you
a
pittance
to
live
on
so
long
as
you
remain
here
i
wish
you
to
become
a
visible
moral
a
walking
monument
of
disgrace
in
the
neighbourhood
you
ruled
should
you
attempt
to
escape
me
the
payment
will
be
stopped
should
you
obtain
employment
your
character
shall
be
exposed
at
every
turn
you
shall
be
struck
down
till
you
learn
to
kiss
the
hand
that
strikes
you
and
beg
for
pity
on
your
knees
my
revenge
anne
shall
be
to
break
your
are
you
not
perhaps
afraid
that
i
may
turn
upon
you
you
know
me
to
be
a
woman
of
strong
will
and
many
resources
some
of
which
you
do
not
even
i
am
not
afraid
because
i
still
have
a
reserve
force
i
still
hold
the
letters
that
i
stole
two
days
ago
and
even
should
you
murder
me
i
have
left
directions
that
will
ensure
your
a
pause
ensued
you
nothing
more
to
say
he
said
at
last
anne
that
i
were
to
tell
you
that
i
have
been
trying
to
frighten
you
and
that
if
you
were
to
go
down
on
your
knees
before
me
now
and
beg
my
forgiveness
i
would
forgive
not
forgive
you
but
let
you
off
with
easier
you
do
it
john
i
would
not
once
i
went
on
my
knees
to
a
man
and
i
have
not
forgotten
the
lesson
he
taught
me
do
your
you
understand
my
terms
and
accept
them
them
yes
i
understand
that
you
are
a
man
and
like
all
men
cruel
and
desirous
of
exacting
the
uttermost
farthing
in
the
way
of
revenge
forgetting
that
you
owe
everything
to
me
i
do
not
wish
to
exculpate
myself
mind
you
looking
at
the
case
from
your
point
of
view
and
in
your
own
petty
way
i
can
almost
sympathize
with
you
but
as
for
accepting
your
you
know
me
so
little
as
to
think
that
i
could
do
so
have
you
not
learnt
that
i
may
break
but
shall
never
bend
and
if
i
chose
now
to
face
the
matter
out
i
should
beat
you
even
now
when
you
hold
all
the
cards
in
your
hand
but
i
am
weary
of
it
all
especially
weary
of
you
and
your
little
ways
and
i
do
not
choose
you
will
injure
me
enough
to
make
the
great
success
i
planned
for
us
both
impossible
and
i
am
tired
of
everything
except
the
success
which
crowns
a
struggle
well
i
have
ways
of
escape
you
know
nothing
of
do
your
worst
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
and
she
leaned
back
easily
in
her
chair
and
looked
at
him
with
wearied
and
indifferent
eyes
little
sir
john
ground
his
teeth
and
twisted
his
face
into
a
scowl
that
looked
absurdly
out
of
place
on
anything
so
jovial
you
he
said
now
you
dare
to
defy
me
do
you
know
you
woman
fiend
that
at
this
moment
i
almost
think
i
love
you
course
i
know
it
if
you
did
not
love
me
you
would
not
take
all
this
trouble
to
try
to
crush
me
but
this
conversation
is
very
long
shall
we
put
an
end
to
it
sir
john
sat
still
a
moment
thinking
and
gazing
at
the
splendid
creature
before
him
with
a
mixture
of
hatred
and
respect
then
he
rose
and
spoke
you
are
a
wonderful
woman
i
can
not
do
it
i
can
not
utterly
ruin
you
you
must
be
could
not
help
that
if
i
we
must
separate
but
i
will
be
generous
to
you
i
will
allow
you
five
hundred
a
year
and
you
shall
live
where
you
like
you
shall
not
she
laughed
a
little
as
she
answered
am
starving
now
it
is
long
past
luncheon
time
as
for
your
five
hundred
a
year
that
you
will
give
me
out
of
the
three
or
four
thousand
i
have
given
you
i
care
nothing
for
it
i
tell
you
i
am
tired
of
it
all
and
i
never
felt
more
superior
to
you
than
i
do
now
in
the
moment
of
your
triumph
it
wants
a
stronger
hand
than
yours
to
humble
me
i
may
be
a
bad
woman
i
daresay
i
am
but
you
will
find
too
late
that
there
are
few
in
the
world
like
me
for
years
you
have
shone
with
a
reflected
light
when
the
light
goes
out
you
will
go
out
too
get
back
into
your
native
mud
the
mental
slime
out
of
which
i
picked
you
contemptible
creature
that
you
are
and
when
you
have
lost
me
learn
to
measure
the
loss
by
the
depths
to
which
you
will
sink
i
reject
your
offers
i
mock
at
your
threats
for
they
will
recoil
on
your
own
head
i
despise
you
and
i
have
done
with
you
john
bellamy
bye
and
with
a
proud
curtsey
she
swept
from
the
room
that
evening
it
was
rumoured
that
sir
john
bellamy
had
separated
from
his
wife
owing
to
circumstances
which
had
come
to
his
knowledge
in
connection
with
george
death
chapter
lx
that
same
afternoon
lady
bellamy
ordered
out
the
victoria
with
the
fast
trotting
horse
and
drove
to
the
abbey
house
she
found
philip
pacing
up
and
down
the
gravel
in
front
of
the
grey
old
place
which
had
that
morning
added
one
more
to
the
long
list
of
human
tragedies
its
walls
had
witnessed
his
face
was
pale
and
contorted
by
mental
suffering
and
as
soon
as
he
recognized
lady
bellamy
he
made
an
effort
to
escape
she
stopped
him
suppose
it
is
here
caresfoot
what
wish
to
see
philip
hesitated
a
minute
and
then
led
the
way
to
his
study
the
corpse
had
been
laid
upon
the
table
just
as
it
had
been
taken
from
the
water
indeed
the
wet
still
fell
in
heavy
drops
from
the
clothes
on
to
the
ground
it
was
to
be
removed
to
roxham
that
evening
to
await
the
inquest
on
the
morrow
the
shutters
of
the
room
had
been
closed
lest
the
light
should
strike
too
fiercely
on
the
ghastly
sight
but
even
in
the
twilight
lady
bellamy
could
discern
every
detail
of
its
outline
clearly
marked
by
the
wet
patches
on
the
sheet
which
was
thrown
loosely
over
it
on
a
chair
by
the
side
of
the
table
above
the
level
of
which
its
head
rose
giving
it
the
appearance
of
being
in
the
act
of
climbing
on
to
it
lay
the
carcass
of
the
dog
its
teeth
still
firmly
set
in
the
dead
arm
they
had
been
unable
to
unlock
the
savage
grip
without
hacking
its
jaws
asunder
and
this
it
was
not
thought
advisable
to
do
till
after
the
inquest
at
the
door
philip
paused
as
though
he
did
not
mean
to
enter
in
said
lady
bellamy
you
are
not
afraid
of
a
dead
fear
the
dead
a
great
deal
more
than
i
do
the
living
he
muttered
but
came
in
and
shut
the
door
as
soon
as
her
eyes
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
light
lady
bellamy
went
up
to
the
body
and
drawing
off
the
sheet
gazed
long
and
steadily
at
the
mutilated
face
on
the
lips
of
which
the
bloody
froth
still
stood
told
him
last
night
she
said
presently
to
philip
we
should
never
meet
again
alive
but
i
did
not
think
to
see
him
so
soon
like
this
do
you
know
that
i
once
loved
that
thing
that
shattered
brain
directed
the
only
will
to
which
i
ever
bowed
but
the
love
went
out
for
ever
last
night
the
chain
snapped
and
now
i
can
look
upon
this
sight
without
a
single
sigh
or
a
regret
with
nothing
but
loathing
and
disgust
there
lies
the
man
who
ruined
you
know
it
i
do
not
care
who
knows
it
me
with
his
eyes
open
not
caring
anything
about
me
there
lies
the
hard
whom
i
served
through
so
many
years
the
villain
who
drove
me
against
my
will
into
this
last
crime
which
has
thus
brought
its
reward
the
dog
gave
him
his
just
due
look
its
teeth
still
hold
him
as
fast
perhaps
as
the
memories
of
his
crimes
will
hold
him
where
he
has
gone
regret
him
sorrow
for
him
no
oh
no
i
can
curse
him
as
he
lies
villain
monster
devil
that
he
was
she
paused
and
even
in
the
dim
light
philip
could
see
her
bosom
heave
and
her
great
eyes
flash
with
the
fierceness
of
her
excitement
should
not
talk
so
of
the
dead
he
said
are
right
she
answered
has
gone
beyond
the
reach
of
my
words
but
the
thought
of
all
the
misery
i
have
suffered
at
his
hands
made
me
for
a
moment
mad
cover
it
up
again
the
vile
frame
which
held
a
viler
soul
to
the
earth
with
the
one
to
undreamed
of
sorrow
with
the
other
each
to
its
appointed
place
how
does
it
run
wages
of
sin
is
yes
that
is
right
he
is
dead
the
blow
fell
first
on
him
that
was
right
and
i
am
about
to
die
and
will
happen
to
you
the
judas
of
the
plot
eh
you
do
not
think
that
you
will
enjoy
your
in
peace
do
you
do
you
mean
asked
philip
nervously
her
wild
way
frightened
him
why
that
you
are
the
sorriest
knave
of
all
this
man
was
at
least
led
on
to
crime
by
passion
bellamy
entered
into
it
to
work
out
a
secret
revenge
poor
fool
i
acted
because
i
help
myself
at
first
and
then
for
the
sake
of
the
game
itself
for
when
i
take
a
thing
in
my
hand
i
succeed
but
you
philip
caresfoot
you
sold
your
own
flesh
and
blood
for
money
or
worth
and
you
are
the
worst
of
than
george
for
even
a
brutal
love
is
a
nobler
thing
than
avarice
like
yours
well
as
the
sin
is
so
will
the
punishment
is
a
lie
i
thought
that
he
was
thought
that
arthur
heigham
was
dead
i
read
your
thoughts
very
wrongly
when
we
met
upon
the
road
on
christmas
day
you
wished
to
think
that
he
was
dead
but
you
did
not
think
it
even
now
your
conscience
is
making
a
coward
of
you
and
as
you
said
just
now
for
you
the
silence
of
the
dead
is
more
terrible
than
the
accusations
of
the
living
i
know
a
little
about
you
philip
do
you
not
see
shadows
on
your
walls
and
do
not
departed
voices
come
to
haunt
you
in
your
sleep
i
know
you
do
and
i
will
tell
you
which
you
have
suffered
from
at
times
shall
henceforth
be
your
continual
companions
if
you
can
pray
pray
with
all
your
strength
that
your
daughter
may
not
die
for
if
she
does
her
shadow
will
always
be
there
to
haunt
you
with
the
rest
why
do
you
tremble
so
at
the
mere
mention
of
a
spirit
stand
still
and
i
will
show
you
one
i
can
if
i
philip
could
stand
it
no
longer
with
a
curse
he
burst
out
of
the
room
presently
she
followed
him
and
found
him
standing
in
front
of
the
house
wiping
the
cold
perspiration
from
his
forehead
accursed
woman
he
said
and
never
come
near
this
house
again
never
shall
come
to
this
house
again
she
answered
here
is
my
carriage
philip
caresfoot
you
are
a
very
wealthy
man
i
do
not
know
how
many
thousands
a
year
you
have
been
singularly
have
accomplished
your
ends
few
people
can
do
that
may
the
accomplishment
bring
happiness
with
it
if
you
wish
it
to
do
so
stifle
your
conscience
and
do
not
let
your
superstitions
affect
you
but
by
the
way
you
know
french
do
you
not
then
here
is
a
maxim
that
in
parting
i
recommend
to
your
has
some
truth
in
it
il
y
a
une
page
effrayante
dans
le
livre
des
destinees
humaines
on
y
lit
en
tête
ces
mots
desirs
and
she
was
gone
owed
him
a
debt
for
tempting
george
on
in
that
business
thought
lady
bellamy
to
herself
as
she
rolled
swiftly
down
the
avenue
of
giant
walnuts
i
think
that
i
have
repaid
it
the
thorn
i
have
planted
will
fester
in
his
flesh
till
he
dies
of
the
sore
superstition
run
wild
in
his
weak
mind
will
make
the
world
a
hell
for
him
and
that
is
what
i
presently
she
stopped
the
carriage
and
walked
to
the
top
of
a
little
knoll
commanding
what
had
been
isleworth
hall
but
was
now
a
black
smoking
blot
on
the
landscape
the
white
front
of
the
house
was
still
standing
though
riven
from
top
to
bottom
and
through
its
empty
the
westering
sun
poured
great
streams
of
fire
which
looked
like
flame
shining
through
the
of
a
gigantic
skull
did
that
well
she
said
yet
how
blind
i
was
i
should
have
known
that
he
spoke
the
truth
when
he
said
the
letters
were
not
there
my
skill
failed
always
does
fail
at
need
i
thought
the
fire
would
reach
them
when
she
arrived
at
rewtham
house
she
found
that
sir
john
had
left
taking
luggage
with
him
and
stating
that
he
was
going
to
put
up
at
an
inn
at
roxham
on
the
too
lay
a
summons
to
attend
the
inquest
on
the
body
of
george
caresfoot
which
was
to
take
place
on
the
morrow
she
tore
it
across
then
she
went
up
and
dressed
herself
for
dinner
with
such
splendour
that
her
maid
thought
it
necessary
to
remind
her
that
there
was
no
company
coming
she
said
with
a
strange
smile
i
am
going
out
give
me
my
sapphire
she
sat
through
dinner
and
afterwards
went
into
the
and
opening
a
read
and
burnt
a
great
number
of
papers
go
the
keys
to
my
knowledge
she
said
aloud
as
they
flickered
and
fell
into
ashes
one
shall
reap
the
fruits
of
my
labours
and
yet
it
is
a
was
on
the
right
track
and
though
i
could
never
have
succeeded
another
might
i
had
the
key
though
i
could
not
find
the
lock
i
must
go
through
with
it
now
i
can
not
live
deprived
both
of
success
and
of
my
secret
power
and
i
could
never
begin
and
climb
that
stair
then
from
a
secret
drawer
in
the
she
extracted
a
little
phial
tightly
stoppered
and
she
examined
it
closely
and
looked
at
the
liquid
in
it
against
the
light
medicine
has
taken
no
harm
during
this
twenty
years
she
thought
still
looks
what
it
enough
to
kill
a
giant
and
subtle
enough
to
leave
little
trace
upon
a
then
she
shut
up
the
and
put
it
away
and
going
to
the
open
window
looked
up
at
the
stars
and
then
down
at
the
shadows
flung
by
the
clouds
as
they
swept
across
the
moon
she
mused
and
gleams
of
light
between
the
shadows
is
like
our
life
light
clear
is
like
the
wider
life
and
between
the
night
and
above
them
stars
the
immensity
where
shall
i
find
my
place
oh
that
i
might
sleep
eternally
yes
that
would
be
best
of
sink
into
sleep
never
ending
unbroken
and
unbreakable
to
be
absorbed
into
the
cool
vastness
of
the
night
and
lie
in
her
great
arms
for
ever
oh
night
whom
i
have
ever
loved
you
bring
your
sleep
to
wearied
bring
sleep
eternal
but
no
the
stars
are
above
the
night
and
above
the
stars
yes
the
hour
i
dread
like
every
other
mortal
with
my
body
and
yet
dare
to
long
for
with
my
spirit
has
come
i
am
about
to
cast
off
time
and
pass
into
eternity
to
spring
from
the
giddy
heights
of
space
into
the
uncertain
arms
of
the
infinite
yet
a
few
minutes
and
my
essence
my
vital
part
will
start
upon
its
endless
course
and
passing
far
above
those
stars
will
find
the
fount
of
that
knowledge
of
which
it
has
already
sipped
and
drink
and
drink
till
it
grows
like
a
god
and
can
look
upon
the
truth
and
not
be
blinded
such
are
my
high
hopes
and
there
be
a
hell
my
life
has
been
evil
my
sins
many
what
if
there
be
an
avenging
power
waiting
as
some
think
to
grind
me
into
powder
and
then
endow
each
crushed
particle
with
individual
sense
of
endless
misery
what
if
there
be
a
hell
in
a
few
minutes
or
what
will
seem
but
a
few
minutes
surely
to
the
disembodied
spirit
time
can
not
exist
though
it
sleep
a
billion
years
it
will
be
as
a
shall
have
solved
the
problem
i
shall
know
what
all
the
millions
madly
ask
and
ask
in
vain
yes
i
shall
know
if
is
a
hell
well
if
there
be
then
i
shall
rule
there
for
power
is
native
to
my
soul
let
me
hesitate
no
longer
but
go
and
solve
the
problem
before
i
grow
afraid
am
not
afraid
have
immortal
longings
in
who
was
it
said
that
oh
cleopatra
was
cleopatra
more
beautiful
than
i
am
i
wonder
i
am
sure
that
she
was
not
so
great
for
had
i
been
her
antony
should
have
driven
caesar
out
of
egypt
oh
if
i
could
have
loved
with
a
pure
and
perfect
love
as
other
women
may
and
intertwined
my
destiny
with
that
of
some
being
of
a
nature
kindred
to
my
should
have
been
good
and
happy
and
he
should
have
ruled
this
country
but
fate
and
fortune
grown
afraid
of
what
i
should
do
linked
my
life
to
a
soulless
brute
and
alas
like
him
i
have
irretrievably
she
closed
the
window
and
coming
into
the
room
rang
the
bell
me
some
wine
she
said
to
the
servant
do
not
feel
wine
my
lady
the
wine
was
brought
and
stood
uncorked
upon
the
table
will
do
she
said
my
maid
not
to
sit
up
for
me
it
will
be
late
before
i
go
to
bed
the
man
bowed
and
went
and
she
poured
out
some
of
the
sparkling
wine
and
then
taking
the
little
phial
opened
it
with
difficulty
and
emptied
its
contents
into
the
glass
the
wine
boiled
up
furiously
turned
and
then
cleared
again
but
the
poison
had
destroyed
its
was
dead
as
is
strange
she
said
never
saw
that
effect
next
she
took
the
phial
and
powdered
it
into
a
pinch
of
tiny
dust
with
a
tooth
that
lay
upon
the
table
the
dust
she
took
to
the
window
and
threw
out
a
little
at
a
time
lady
bellamy
wished
to
die
as
she
had
lived
a
mystery
then
she
came
and
stood
over
the
deadly
draught
she
had
compounded
and
thought
sometimes
aloud
and
sometimes
to
herself
have
heard
it
said
that
suicides
are
cowards
let
those
who
say
it
stand
as
i
stand
with
death
lying
in
the
little
circle
of
a
glass
before
them
and
they
will
know
whether
they
are
cowards
or
if
they
are
spirits
of
a
braver
sort
than
those
who
can
bear
to
drudge
to
the
bitter
end
of
life
it
is
not
yet
too
late
i
can
throw
that
stuff
away
i
can
leave
this
place
and
begin
life
anew
in
some
other
country
my
jewels
will
give
me
the
means
and
for
the
matter
of
that
i
can
always
win
as
much
money
as
i
want
but
no
then
i
must
begin
again
and
for
that
i
have
not
the
patience
or
the
time
besides
i
long
to
to
solve
the
mystery
come
let
me
make
an
end
i
will
chance
it
spirits
like
my
own
wear
their
life
only
while
it
does
not
gall
them
if
it
begins
to
fret
they
cast
it
from
them
like
a
dress
scorning
to
wrap
it
round
them
till
it
drops
away
in
she
raised
the
glass
lonely
this
place
is
and
how
still
and
yet
it
may
well
be
that
there
are
millions
round
me
watching
what
i
do
why
does
he
come
into
my
mind
now
that
good
man
and
the
child
i
bore
him
shall
i
see
them
presently
will
they
crush
me
with
their
reproaches
my
nerves
broken
down
it
fancy
or
does
that
pale
face
with
warning
in
her
eyes
float
between
me
and
the
wall
well
i
will
drink
to
her
for
her
mind
could
even
overtop
my
own
she
was
at
least
my
equal
and
i
have
driven
her
mad
let
me
taste
this
lifting
the
glass
to
her
lips
she
drank
a
little
and
set
it
down
the
effect
was
almost
magical
her
eyes
blazed
a
new
beauty
bloomed
upon
her
cheek
her
whole
grand
presence
seemed
to
gain
in
majesty
the
quick
drug
for
a
moment
burnt
away
the
curtain
between
the
seen
and
the
unseen
and
yet
left
her
living
she
cried
in
the
silence
of
the
room
it
runs
along
my
veins
i
hear
the
rushing
of
the
stars
i
see
strange
worlds
my
soul
leaps
through
infinite
spaces
the
white
light
of
immortality
strikes
upon
my
eyes
and
blinds
me
come
life
unending
i
have
conquered
seizing
the
poison
she
swallowed
what
remained
of
it
and
dashed
the
glass
down
beside
her
then
she
fell
heavily
on
her
face
once
she
struggled
to
her
knees
then
fell
again
and
lay
still
chapter
lxi
after
throwing
george
caresfoot
into
the
arthur
walked
steadily
back
to
the
inn
where
he
arrived
quite
composed
in
manner
at
about
seven
old
sam
the
ostler
was
in
the
yard
washing
a
trap
he
went
up
to
him
and
asked
when
the
next
train
started
for
london
is
one
as
leaves
roxham
at
nine
sir
and
an
uncommon
fast
one
told
but

the
gig
ready
in
time
to
catch
the
good
sir
been
to
the
fire
i
suppose
sir
he
went
on
dimly
perceiving
that
clothes
were
torn

a
fine
place
it
wore
and
it
did
blaze
right
what
fire
me
sir
you
see
it
last
night
isleworth
hall
to
be
sure
it
wore
burnt
right
out
and
all
as

in
how
did
it
come
to
get
burnt
say
sir
but
i
did
hear
say
how
as
lady
bellamy
was
there
last
night
along
with
the
squire
the
squire
he
went
out
somewhere
my
lady
she
goes
home
and
the
footman
he
goes
to
put
out
the
lamp
and
finds
the
a
roaring
fiery
furnace
like
as
parson
tells
us
on
but
i
know
how
that
can
be
for
i
heard
how
as
the
squire
was
so
likely
that
he
was
out
but
lord
sir
folk
in
these
parts

lie

uncommon
as

be
when
i
was
a
boy
as
like
as
no

more
dying
than
you
are
anyhow
sir
it
all
burned
like
tinder
and
the
only
thing
so
told
as
was
saved
was
a
naked
stone
statty
of
a
girl
with
a
chain
round
her
wrists
as
jim
blakes
our
constable
being
in
liquor
brought
out
in
his
arms
thinking
how
as
it
was
alive
and
tried
to
rewive
it
with
cold
at
that
moment
story
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
a
cart
be

marked
immediate
and
he
handed
arthur
a
box
arthur
thanked
him
and
taking
it
went
up
to
his
room
leaving
old
sam
delighted
to
find
a
new
listener
to
his
story
of
the
fire
it
was
from
the
florist
and
contained
the
bouquet
he
had
meant
to
give
angela
on
her
it
had
cost
him
a
good
deal
of
thought
that
bouquet
to
say
nothing
of
five
guineas
of
the
coin
of
the
realm
and
he
felt
a
certain
curiosity
to
look
at
it
though
to
do
so
gave
him
something
of
the
same
sensation
that
we
experience
in
reading
a
letter
written
by
some
loved
hand
which
we
know
grew
cold
before
the
lines
it
traced
could
reach
us
he
took
the
box
to
his
room
and
opened
it
the
bouquet
was
a
lovely
thing
and
did
credit
even
to
covent
garden
and
the
masses
of
stephanotis
and
relieved
here
and
there
by
rising
sprays
of
filled
the
whole
room
with
fragrance
he
drew
it
from
the
in
which
it
was
packed
in
moss
and
and
wondered
what
he
should
do
with
it
he
could
not
leave
such
a
thing
about
nor
would
he
take
it
away
suddenly
an
idea
struck
him
and
he
repacked
it
in
its
case
as
carefully
as
he
could
in
the
original
moss
and
and
then
looked
about
for
the
sheet
of
that
should
complete
the
covering
he
had
destroyed
it
and
had
to
search
for
a
substitute
in
so
doing
his
eye
fell
upon
a
long
envelope
on
his
and
he
smiled
it
contained
his
marriage
licence
and
he
bethought
him
that
it
was
a
very
fair
substitute
for
and
quite
as
worthless
he
extracted
it
and
placing
it
over
the
flowers
closed
up
the
box
then
he
carefully
directed
it
to
george
caresfoot
abbey
house
and
ringing
the
bell
desired
the
boots
to
find
a
messenger
to
take
it
over
when
he
had
done
all
this
he
sat
down
and
wondered
what
could
have
come
to
him
that
he
could
take
pleasure
in
doing
a
cruel
action
only
worthy
of
a
jealous
woman
perhaps
of
all
the
bitter
cups
which
are
held
to
our
lips
in
this
sad
world
there
is
none
more
bitter
than
that
which
it
was
his
lot
to
drink
of
now
to
begin
with
the
blow
fell
in
youth
when
we
love
or
hate
or
act
with
an
ardour
and
an
entire
devotion
that
we
give
to
nothing
in
it
is
then
that
the
heart
puts
forth
its
most
tender
and
yet
its
most
lusty
shoots
and
if
they
are
crushed
the
whole
plant
suffers
and
sometimes
bleeds
to
death
arthur
had
to
an
extent
quite
unrealized
by
himself
until
he
lost
her
centred
all
his
life
in
this
woman
and
it
was
no
exaggeration
to
say
as
he
had
said
to
her
that
she
had
murdered
his
heart
and
withered
up
all
that
was
best
in
it
she
had
done
more
she
had
inflicted
the
most
cruel
injury
upon
him
that
a
woman
can
inflict
upon
a
man
she
had
shaken
his
belief
in
her
sex
at
large
he
felt
sitting
there
in
his
desolation
that
now
he
had
lost
angela
he
could
never
be
the
same
man
he
would
otherwise
have
been
her
cruel
desertion
had
shattered
the
tinted
glass
through
which
youth
looks
at
the
world
and
he
now
before
his
day
saw
it
as
it
is
grim
and
hard
and
full
of
coarse
realities
and
did
not
yet
know
that
time
would
again
soften
down
the
sharpest
of
the
rough
outlines
and
throw
a
garment
of
its
own
over
the
nakedness
of
life
he
was
a
hearted
man
and
not
a
vain
one
and
had
he
thought
that
angela
had
ceased
to
care
for
him
and
loved
this
other
man
he
could
have
found
it
in
his
heart
to
forgive
her
and
even
to
sympathize
with
her
but
he
could
not
think
this
something
told
him
that
it
was
not
so
she
had
contracted
herself
into
a
shameful
loveless
marriage
and
to
gain
ends
quite
foreign
to
all
love
had
raised
a
barrier
between
them
which
had
no
right
to
exist
and
yet
one
that
in
this
world
could
he
thought
never
be
removed
misfortunes
rain
upon
us
from
every
quarter
of
the
sky
but
so
long
as
they
come
from
the
sky
we
can
bear
them
for
they
are
beyond
the
control
of
our
own
volition
and
must
be
accepted
as
we
accept
the
gale
or
the
lightning
it
is
the
troubles
which
spring
from
our
own
folly
and
weakness
or
from
that
of
those
with
whom
our
lives
are
intertwined
which
really
crush
us
now
arthur
knew
enough
of
the
world
to
be
aware
that
there
is
no
folly
to
equal
that
of
a
woman
who
of
her
own
free
will
truly
loving
one
man
whom
she
can
marry
if
she
wills
it
deliberately
gives
herself
to
another
it
is
not
only
a
folly
it
is
a
crime
and
like
most
crimes
for
this
life
an
irretrievable
mistake
long
before
he
got
back
to
london
the
first
unwholesome
exaltation
of
mind
that
always
follows
a
great
misfortune
and
which
may
perhaps
be
compared
with
the
excitement
that
for
awhile
covers
the
shameful
sense
of
defeat
in
an
army
had
evaporated
and
he
began
to
realize
the
crushing
awfulness
of
the
blow
which
had
fallen
on
him
and
to
fear
lest
it
should
drive
him
mad
he
looked
round
his
little
horizon
for
some
straw
of
comfort
at
which
to
catch
and
could
find
none
nothing
but
dreadful
thoughts
and
sickening
visions
and
then
suddenly
just
as
he
was
sinking
into
the
dulness
of
despair
there
came
like
the
first
gleam
of
light
in
chaotic
darkness
the
memory
of
mildred
carr
truly
she
had
spoken
prophetically
his
idol
had
been
utterly
cast
down
and
crushed
to
powder
by
a
hand
stronger
than
his
own
he
would
go
to
her
in
his
suffering
perhaps
she
could
find
means
to
comfort
him
when
he
reached
town
he
took
a
hansom
and
went
to
look
for
some
rooms
he
would
not
return
to
those
he
had
left
on
the
previous
afternoon
for
the
sympathetic
landlord
had
helped
him
to
pack
up
the
wedding
clothes
and
had
admired
the
wedding
gift
arthur
felt
that
he
could
not
face
him
again
he
found
some
to
suit
him
in
duke
street
james
and
left
his
things
there
thence
he
drove
to
fenchurch
street
and
took
a
passage
to
madeira
the
clerk
the
same
one
who
had
given
him
his
ticket
about
a
year
before
remembered
him
perfectly
and
asked
him
how
he
got
on
with
carr
but
when
his
passage
was
taken
he
was
disgusted
to
find
that
the
mail
did
not
sail
for
another
five
days
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
only
one
he
could
scarcely
believe
what
had
happened
had
only
occurred
that
morning
only
seven
hours
ago
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
stood
face
to
face
with
angela
not
that
morning
but
years
ago
and
miles
away
on
some
desolate
shore
which
lay
on
the
other
side
of
a
dead
ocean
of
pain
and
yet
it
was
only
seven
hours
if
the
hours
went
with
such
heavy
wings
how
would
the
days
pass
and
the
months
and
the
years
what
should
he
do
with
himself
in
his
condition
perpetual
activity
was
as
necessary
to
him
as
air
he
must
do
something
to
dull
the
sharp
edge
of
his
suffering
or
the
sword
of
madness
which
hung
over
him
by
such
a
slender
thread
would
fall
suddenly
he
bethought
him
of
a
man
whom
he
had
known
slightly
up
at
cambridge
a
man
of
wealth
and
evil
reputation
this
man
would
he
felt
be
able
to
put
him
in
a
way
of
getting
through
his
time
he
knew
his
address
and
thither
he
drove
four
days
later
a
figure
shrunk
shaky
and
looking
prematurely
old
with
the
glaze
of
intoxication
scarcely
faded
from
his
eye
walked
into
office
that
respectable
gentleman
looked
and
looked
again
heavens
he
said
at
length
arthur
it
is
though
said
an
unequal
voice
come
for
some
money
got
none
left
and
i
am
going
to
madeira
dear
boy
what
has
happened
to
you
you
look
so
very
strange
i
have
been
expecting
to
see
your
marriage
in
the
paper
why
only
a
few
days
ago
that
you
left
to
be
few
days
a
few
years
you
mean
been
jilted
all
nothing
to
speak
of
you
know
but
i
had
rather
not
talk
about
it
if
you
mind
like
a
nag
with
a
flayed
back
like
the
sight
of
the
saddle
at
present
and
poor
arthur
mentally
and
physically
exhausted
put
his
head
down
on
his
arm
and
gulped
the
old
lawyer
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
hit
he
said
to
himself
gone
on
to
the
burst
and
then
aloud
well
that
has
happened
to
many
a
man
in
fact
you
believe
it
but
it
once
happened
to
me
and
i
look
much
the
worse
do
i
but
we
talk
about
it
the
less
said
of
a
bad
business
the
better
my
maxim
and
so
you
are
going
abroad
again
have
you
got
any
friends
at
madeira
arthur
nodded
you
want
some
more
money
let
me
see
i
sent
you
pounds
last
was
for
my
wedding
tour
spent
it
now
you
can
guess
how
i
have
spent
it
pleasant
contrast
it
gives
rise
to
moral
come
heigham
you
must
not
give
way
like
that
these
things
happen
to
most
men
in
the
course
of
their
lives
and
if
they
are
wise
it
teaches
them
that
gingerbread
all
gilt
and
to
set
down
women
at
their
proper
value
and
appreciate
a
good
one
if
it
pleases
providence
to
give
them
one
in
course
of
time
you
go
making
a
fool
of
yourself
over
this
pretty
face
handsome
is
as
handsome
does
these
things
are
hard
to
bear
i
know
but
you
make
them
any
better
by
pitching
your
own
reputation
after
a
want
of
know
that
you
are
quite
right
and
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
kind
advice
but
we
say
anything
more
about
it
i
suppose
that
you
can
let
me
have
some
money
yes
if
you
want
it
though
i
think
we
shall
have
to
overdraw
what
do
you
want
two
hundred
here
is
the
am
anxious
about
that
young
fellow
said
borley
to
himself
in
the
pause
between
departure
and
the
entry
of
the
next
client
hope
his
disappointment
send
him
to
the
dogs
he
is
not
of
the
sort
who
take
it
easy
like
i
did
for
instance
dear
me
that
is
a
long
while
ago
now
i
wonder
what
the
details
of
his
little
affair
were
and
who
the
girl
married
captain
shuffle
yes
show
him
chapter
lxii
next
morning
arthur
cashed
his
cheque
and
started
on
his
travels
he
had
no
very
clear
idea
why
he
was
going
back
to
madeira
or
what
he
meant
to
do
when
he
got
there
but
then
at
this
painful
stage
of
his
existence
none
of
his
ideas
could
be
called
clear
though
he
did
not
realize
it
what
he
was
searching
for
was
sympathy
female
sympathy
of
course
for
in
trouble
members
of
either
sex
gravitate
instinctively
to
the
other
for
comfort
perhaps
they
do
not
quite
trust
their
own
or
perhaps
they
are
afraid
of
being
laughed
at
was
not
one
of
those
natures
that
can
lock
their
griefs
within
the
bosom
and
let
them
lie
there
till
in
process
of
time
they
shrivel
away
except
among
members
of
the
peerage
as
pictured
in
current
literature
these
stern
proud
creatures
are
not
common
man
whether
he
figures
in
the
world
as
a
peer
or
a
is
as
a
matter
of
fact
mentally
as
well
as
physically
gregarious
and
adverse
to
loneliness
either
in
his
joys
or
sorrows
decidedly
too
the
homoeopathic
system
must
be
founded
on
great
natural
facts
and
there
is
philosophy
born
of
the
observation
of
human
nature
in
the
somewhat
vulgar
proverb
that
recommends
a
of
the
dog
that
bit
otherwise
nine
men
out
of
every
ten
who
have
been
badly
treated
or
think
that
they
have
been
badly
treated
by
a
woman
would
not
at
once
rush
headlong
for
refuge
to
another
a
proceeding
which
also
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
ends
in
making
confusion
worse
confounded
arthur
though
he
was
not
aware
of
it
was
exemplifying
a
natural
law
that
has
not
yet
been
properly
explained
but
even
if
he
had
known
it
it
is
doubtful
if
the
knowledge
would
have
made
him
any
happier
for
it
is
irritating
to
reflect
that
we
are
the
slaves
of
natural
laws
that
our
action
is
not
the
outcome
of
our
own
volition
but
of
a
vague
force
working
silently
as
the
gulf
such
knowledge
makes
a
man
measure
his
weakness
and
so
strikes
at
his
tenderest
point
his
vanity
but
whilst
we
have
been
reflecting
together
my
reader
and
i
arthur
was
making
his
way
to
madeira
so
we
may
as
well
all
come
to
a
halt
off
funchal
very
shortly
after
the
vessel
had
dropped
her
anchor
arthur
was
greeted
by
his
friend
the
manager
of
to
see
you
sir
though
i
say
that
you
look
well
i
scarcely
expected
to
find
anybody
for
us
at
this
time
of
year
business
is
very
slack
in
the
i
suppose
that
madeira
is
pretty
is
nobody
here
at
all
carr
gone
then
asked
arthur
in
some
alarm
she
is
still
here
she
has
not
been
away
this
year
but
she
has
been
very
quiet
no
parties
or
anything
which
makes
people
think
that
she
has
lost
by
this
time
the
boat
was
rising
on
the
roll
of
the
last
billow
to
be
caught
next
moment
by
a
dozen
hands
and
dragged
up
the
shingle
it
was
evening
or
rather
verging
that
way
and
from
under
the
trees
below
the
cathedral
there
came
the
sound
of
the
band
summoning
the
inhabitants
of
funchal
to
congregate
chatter
and
flirt
think
said
arthur
i
will
ask
you
to
take
my
things
up
to
the
hotel
i
will
come
i
should
like
the
same
room
i
had
before
if
it
is
good
heigham
you
will
have
the
place
nearly
all
to
yourself
having
seen
his
baggage
depart
arthur
turned
and
resisting
the
importunities
of
beggars
guides
and
who
had
not
yet
recognized
him
as
an
old
hand
made
his
way
towards
the
quinta
carr
how
well
he
knew
the
streets
and
houses
even
to
the
withered
faces
of
the
women
who
sat
by
the
doors
and
yet
he
seemed
to
have
grown
old
since
he
had
seen
them
ten
minutes
of
sharp
walking
brought
him
to
the
gates
of
the
quinta
and
he
paused
before
them
and
thought
how
a
few
months
ago
he
had
quitted
them
miserable
at
the
grief
of
another
now
to
them
utterly
crushed
by
his
own
he
walked
on
through
the
beautiful
gardens
to
the
house
the
stood
open
he
did
not
wait
to
ring
but
driven
by
some
impulse
entered
after
the
glare
of
the
sun
which
at
that
time
of
the
year
was
powerful
even
in
its
decline
the
carefully
shaded
hall
seemed
quite
dark
but
by
degrees
his
eyes
adapted
themselves
to
the
altered
light
and
began
to
distinguish
the
familiar
outline
of
the
furniture
next
they
travelled
to
the
door
of
the
where
another
sight
awaited
them
for
there
herself
a
perfect
picture
standing
in
the
doorway
for
a
frame
her
hands
outstretched
in
welcome
and
a
loving
smile
upon
her
lips
was
mildred
was
waiting
for
you
she
said
gently
thought
that
you
would
my
idol
has
been
cast
down
and
as
you
told
me
to
do
i
have
come
back
to
she
answered
are
very
and
then
came
miss
terry
pleased
with
all
her
honest
heart
to
see
him
and
utterly
ignorant
of
the
fierce
currents
that
swept
under
the
smooth
surface
of
their
little
social
sea
miss
terry
was
not
by
nature
a
keen
observer
me
heigham
who
would
have
thought
of
seeing
you
again
so
soon
you
brave
to
cross
the
bay
so
her
thoughts
ran
a
great
deal
on
the
bay
of
biscay
i
think
you
look
quite
well
you
have
such
black
lines
under
your
eyes
and
i
declare
a
grey
hair
i
assure
you
your
favourite
bay
was
enough
to
turn
hair
grey
miss
and
so
talking
cheerfully
they
went
in
to
the
pleasant
little
dinner
mildred
leaning
over
so
slightly
on
his
arm
and
gazing
into
his
sad
face
with
full
and
happy
eyes
after
all
that
he
had
gone
through
it
seemed
to
arthur
as
though
he
had
dropped
into
a
haven
of
rest
here
said
mildred
when
they
rose
from
table
wonder
has
come
to
pass
since
you
deserted
us
look
sceptic
that
you
are
and
she
led
him
to
the
window
and
lifting
a
glass
shade
which
protected
a
showed
him
a
green
spike
peeping
from
the
soil
is
that
is
it
it
is
the
mummy
hyacinth
which
you
declared
that
we
should
never
see
blossom
in
this
world
it
has
budded
whether
or
not
it
will
blossom
who
can
say
is
an
omen
he
said
with
a
little
laugh
and
for
the
first
time
that
evening
their
eyes
met
into
the
garden
and
you
can
smoke
on
the
museum
verandah
it
is
pleasant
there
these
hot
is
dangerous
your
she
laughed
softly
have
proved
yourself
superior
to
then
they
passed
out
together
the
evening
was
still
and
very
sultry
not
a
breath
stirred
the
silence
of
the
night
the
magnolia
the
flower
and
a
thousand
other
blooms
poured
out
their
fragrance
upon
the
surrounding
air
where
it
lay
in
rich
patches
like
perfume
thrown
on
water
a
thin
mist
veiled
the
sea
and
the
little
wavelets
struck
with
a
sorrowful
sound
against
the
rock
below
me
all
about
it
she
had
settled
herself
upon
a
long
low
chair
and
as
she
leant
back
the
starlight
glanced
white
upon
her
arms
and
bosom
is
not
much
to
tell
it
is
a
common
least
i
believe
so
she
threw
me
over
and
the
day
before
i
should
have
married
her
married
another
i
saw
her
the
morning
following
her
marriage
i
do
not
remember
what
i
said
but
i
believe
i
spoke
what
was
in
my
mind
she
fainted
and
i
left
you
spoke
harshly
harshly
now
that
i
have
had
time
to
think
of
it
i
wish
that
i
could
have
had
ten
imaginations
to
shape
my
thoughts
and
ten
tongues
to
speak
them
with
do
you
understand
what
this
woman
has
done
she
has
sold
herself
to
a
mildred
such
a
has
deserted
me
for
a
man
who
is
not
even
a
she
was
forced
into
we
are
not
in
the
middle
ages
a
good
woman
should
have
been
forced
to
drown
herself
before
she
consented
to
commit
such
a
sacrilege
against
herself
as
to
marry
a
man
she
hated
but
she
love
my
dove
my
whom
i
thought
whiter
than
the
snow
could
do
this
and
do
it
deliberately
i
had
rather
have
seen
her
dead
and
myself
dead
with
you
take
a
rather
exaggerated
view
arthur
you
think
perhaps
that
some
of
the
fault
lies
with
you
for
overrating
women
believe
me
so
far
as
my
experience
goes
and
i
have
seen
a
good
many
the
majority
of
them
do
not
possess
the
exalted
purity
of
mind
you
and
many
very
young
men
attribute
to
them
they
are
on
the
contrary
for
the
most
part
quite
ready
to
exercise
a
wise
discretion
in
the
matter
of
marriage
even
when
the
feeble
tendencies
which
represent
their
affections
point
another
way
a
little
pressure
goes
a
long
way
with
them
they
are
always
glad
to
make
the
most
of
it
it
is
the
dust
they
throw
up
to
hide
their
retreat
your
angela
for
instance
was
no
doubt
and
probably
still
is
very
fond
of
you
you
are
a
charming
young
man
with
nice
eyes
and
a
taking
way
with
women
and
she
would
very
much
have
liked
to
marry
you
but
then
she
also
liked
her
estates
she
could
not
have
both
and
being
forced
to
choose
she
chose
the
latter
you
should
take
a
view
of
the
matter
you
are
not
the
first
who
has
suffered
women
especially
young
women
who
do
not
understand
the
value
of
affection
must
be
very
much
in
love
before
they
submit
to
the
that
is
supposed
to
be
characteristic
of
them
and
what
men
talk
of
as
stains
upon
them
they
do
not
consider
as
such
they
know
if
they
know
nothing
else
that
a
good
income
and
an
establishment
will
make
them
perfectly
clean
in
the
opinion
of
their
own
small
little
world
of
shams
and
forms
that
cares
nothing
for
the
spirit
of
the
moral
law
provided
the
letter
is
acted
up
to
it
is
by
this
that
they
mark
their
standard
of
personal
virtues
not
by
the
high
rule
you
men
imagine
for
them
there
is
no
social
soap
so
effectual
as
money
and
speak
like
a
book
and
give
your
own
sex
a
high
character
tell
me
then
would
you
do
such
a
thing
arthur
how
can
you
ask
me
i
had
rather
be
torn
to
pieces
by
wild
horses
i
spoke
of
the
majority
of
the
women
not
of
them
and
yet
she
could
do
it
and
i
thought
her
better
than
do
not
think
that
you
should
speak
bitterly
of
her
arthur
i
think
that
you
should
be
sorry
for
for
her
why
from
what
i
have
gathered
about
her
she
is
not
quite
an
ordinary
young
woman
however
badly
she
may
have
treated
you
she
is
a
person
of
refined
feelings
and
susceptibilities
is
it
not
so
a
then
you
should
pity
her
because
she
will
bitterly
expiate
her
mistake
for
myself
i
do
not
pity
her
much
because
i
will
not
waste
my
sympathy
on
a
fool
for
to
my
mind
the
woman
who
could
do
what
she
has
done
and
deliberately
throw
away
everything
that
can
make
life
really
worth
living
to
us
women
is
a
most
contemptible
fool
but
you
love
her
and
therefore
you
should
be
sorry
for
why
she
is
a
woman
who
at
has
buried
all
the
higher
part
of
life
who
has
of
her
own
act
for
ever
deprived
herself
of
joys
that
nothing
else
can
bring
her
love
true
love
is
almost
the
only
expression
of
which
we
women
are
capable
of
all
the
nobler
instincts
and
vague
yearnings
after
what
is
higher
and
better
than
the
things
we
see
and
feel
around
us
when
we
love
most
and
love
happily
then
we
are
at
our
topmost
bent
and
soar
further
above
the
earth
than
anything
else
can
carry
us
consequently
when
a
woman
is
faithless
to
her
love
which
is
the
purest
and
most
honourable
part
of
her
the
very
best
thing
to
which
she
can
attain
she
clips
her
wings
and
can
fly
no
more
but
must
be
tossed
like
a
crippled
gull
hither
and
thither
upon
the
stormy
surface
of
her
little
sea
of
course
i
speak
of
women
of
the
higher
stamp
many
perhaps
most
will
feel
nothing
of
all
this
in
a
little
while
they
will
grow
content
with
their
dull
round
and
the
alien
nature
which
they
have
mated
with
and
in
their
children
and
their
petty
cares
and
dissipations
will
forget
that
they
possess
a
higher
part
if
indeed
they
do
possess
it
like
everything
else
in
the
world
they
find
their
level
but
with
women
like
your
angela
it
is
another
thing
for
them
time
only
serves
to
increasingly
unveil
the
truth
till
at
last
they
see
it
as
it
is
and
their
hearts
turn
to
stone
backed
with
a
sick
longing
to
see
a
face
that
is
gone
from
them
they
become
lost
spirits
wandering
everlastingly
in
the
emptiness
they
have
chosen
and
finding
no
rest
even
her
children
will
not
console
arthur
uttered
a
smothered
exclamation
start
arthur
you
accustom
yourself
to
the
fact
that
that
woman
has
passed
away
from
you
and
is
as
completely
the
personal
property
of
another
man
as
that
chair
is
mine
but
there
the
subject
is
a
painful
one
to
you
shall
we
change
it
is
one
that
you
seem
to
have
studied
pretty
because
i
have
realized
its
importance
to
a
woman
for
some
years
i
have
longed
to
be
able
to
fall
in
love
and
when
at
last
i
did
so
arthur
and
here
her
voice
grew
very
soft
was
with
a
man
who
could
care
nothing
for
me
such
has
been
my
unlucky
chance
that
a
woman
herself
beloving
and
herself
worthily
beloved
could
throw
her
blessed
opportunity
away
is
to
me
a
thing
inconceivable
and
that
arthur
is
what
your
angela
has
chapter
lxiii
you
will
not
marry
now
mildred
said
arthur
after
a
pause
one
one
he
rose
and
leaning
over
the
railing
of
the
verandah
looked
at
the
sea
the
mist
that
hid
it
was
drifting
and
eddying
hither
and
thither
before
little
puffs
of
wind
and
the
clear
sky
was
clouding
up
is
going
to
be
a
storm
he
said
presently
i
think
so
the
air
feels
like
he
hesitated
a
while
and
looked
down
at
her
she
seemed
very
lovely
in
the
half
lights
as
indeed
she
was
she
too
looked
up
at
him
inquiringly
at
last
he
spoke
you
said
just
now
that
you
would
not
marry
anybody
will
you
make
an
exception
you
marry
me
it
was
her
turn
to
pause
now
are
very
good
she
murmured
i
am
not
at
all
good
you
know
how
the
case
stands
you
know
that
i
still
love
angela
and
that
i
shall
in
all
probability
always
love
her
i
can
not
help
that
but
if
you
will
have
me
mildred
i
will
try
to
be
a
good
husband
to
you
and
to
make
you
happy
will
you
marry
me
dear
not
have
you
then
ceased
to
care
for
me
dear
i
love
you
more
than
ever
you
can
not
dream
how
much
i
do
love
why
will
you
not
marry
me
is
it
because
of
this
business
and
raising
herself
in
the
low
chair
she
looked
at
him
with
intense
earnestness
is
not
the
reason
i
will
not
marry
you
because
i
have
become
a
better
woman
since
you
went
away
because
i
do
not
wish
to
ruin
your
life
you
ask
me
to
do
so
now
in
all
sincerity
but
you
do
not
know
what
you
ask
you
come
from
the
scene
of
as
bitter
a
disappointment
as
can
befall
a
man
and
you
are
a
little
touched
by
the
contrasting
warmth
of
your
reception
here
a
little
moved
by
my
evident
interest
and
perhaps
a
little
influenced
by
my
good
looks
though
are
nothing
much
supposing
that
i
consented
supposing
i
said
i
will
put
my
hand
in
yours
and
be
your
wife
and
that
we
were
married
do
you
think
when
the
freshness
of
the
thing
had
worn
off
that
you
would
be
happy
with
me
i
do
not
you
would
soon
get
horribly
tired
of
me
arthur
for
the
little
leaven
that
leavens
the
whole
lump
is
wanting
you
do
not
love
me
and
the
redundance
of
my
affection
would
weary
you
and
for
my
part
i
should
find
it
difficult
to
continually
struggle
against
an
impalpable
rival
though
indeed
i
should
be
very
willing
to
put
up
with
am
sorry
you
think
arthur
i
do
think
so
but
you
do
not
know
what
it
costs
me
to
say
it
i
am
deliberately
shutting
the
door
which
bars
me
from
my
heaven
i
am
throwing
away
the
chance
i
strove
so
hard
to
win
that
will
tell
you
how
much
i
think
it
do
you
know
i
must
be
a
strange
contradiction
when
i
knew
you
were
engaged
to
another
woman
i
strained
my
every
nerve
to
win
you
from
her
while
the
object
was
still
to
be
gained
i
felt
no
compunction
i
was
fettered
by
no
scruples
i
wanted
to
steal
you
from
her
and
marry
you
myself
but
now
that
all
this
is
changed
and
that
you
of
your
own
free
will
come
and
offer
to
make
me
your
wife
i
for
the
first
time
feel
how
wrong
it
would
be
of
me
to
take
advantage
of
you
in
a
moment
of
pique
and
disappointment
and
bind
you
for
life
to
a
nature
which
you
do
not
really
understand
to
a
violent
and
a
jealous
woman
too
late
when
your
life
was
hampered
and
your
future
spoiled
you
would
discover
that
you
hated
me
arthur
dear
i
will
not
consent
to
bind
you
to
me
by
any
tie
that
can
not
be
mildred
you
should
not
say
such
things
about
yourself
if
you
are
as
violent
and
jealous
as
you
say
you
are
also
a
very
hearted
woman
for
none
other
would
so
sacrifice
herself
perhaps
you
are
right
i
do
not
know
but
whether
you
are
right
or
wrong
i
can
not
tell
you
how
you
have
made
me
respect
those
are
the
most
comfortable
words
i
have
ever
heard
after
what
has
passed
between
us
i
scarcely
thought
to
win
your
you
will
not
marry
me
mildred
is
your
fixed
determination
well
he
sighed
suppose
that
i
had
better
my
again
what
mean
i
had
better
leave
should
you
leave
madeira
he
hesitated
a
little
before
replying
because
if
i
do
not
marry
you
and
still
come
here
people
will
talk
they
did
before
you
you
afraid
of
being
talked
about
then
oh
dear
no
what
can
it
matter
to
me
now
supposing
i
were
to
tell
you
that
what
say
with
or
without
foundation
is
as
much
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
as
the
blowing
of
next
breezes
would
you
still
consider
it
necessary
to
leave
madeira
he
again
rose
and
leant
over
the
verandah
rail
is
going
to
be
a
wild
night
he
said
presently
the
wind
will
spoil
all
the
magnolias
pick
me
that
bud
it
is
too
good
to
be
he
obeyed
and
just
as
he
stepped
back
on
to
the
verandah
a
fierce
rush
of
wind
came
up
from
the
sea
and
went
howling
away
behind
them
love
a
storm
she
murmured
as
he
brought
the
flower
to
her
makes
me
feel
so
strong
and
she
stretched
out
her
perfect
arms
as
though
to
catch
the
wind
am
i
to
do
with
this
magnolia
it
to
me
i
will
pin
it
in
my
do
you
fasten
it
for
the
chair
in
which
she
was
lounging
was
so
low
that
to
do
as
she
bade
him
arthur
was
forced
to
kneel
beside
her
kneeling
thus
the
sweet
upturned
face
was
but
just
beneath
his
own
the
breath
from
the
curved
lips
played
amongst
his
hair
and
again
there
crept
over
him
that
feeling
of
fascination
of
utter
helplessness
that
he
had
once
before
resisted
but
this
time
he
did
not
attempt
to
resist
and
no
vision
came
to
save
him
slowly
drawn
by
the
beauty
of
her
tender
eyes
he
yielded
to
the
spell
and
soon
her
lips
were
pressed
upon
his
own
and
the
white
arms
had
closed
around
his
neck
whilst
the
crushed
magnolia
bloom
shed
its
perfume
round
them
fiercer
swept
the
storm
the
lightning
flashed
and
the
gale
catching
the
crests
of
the
rising
waves
dashed
them
in
spray
to
where
they
sat
he
said
presently
must
not
stop
here
the
spray
is
wetting
wish
that
it
would
drown
me
she
answered
almost
fiercely
shall
never
be
so
happy
again
you
think
that
you
love
me
now
i
should
like
to
die
before
you
learn
to
hate
me
come
let
us
go
in
chapter
lxiv
when
mildred
received
lady
telegram
she
was
so
sure
that
it
would
prove
the
forerunner
of
arrival
at
madeira
that
she
had
at
once
set
about
making
arrangements
for
his
amusement
it
so
happened
that
there
was
at
the
time
a
very
beautiful
steam
yacht
of
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
tons
burden
lying
in
the
roadstead
she
belonged
to
a
nobleman
who
was
suddenly
recalled
to
england
by
and
through
a
series
of
chances
mildred
was
enabled
to
buy
her
a
bargain
the
crew
of
the
departed
nobleman
also
continued
in
her
service
the
morning
after
the
storm
broke
sweet
and
clear
and
except
that
the
flowers
were
somewhat
shattered
all
nature
looked
the
fresher
for
its
violent
visitation
arthur
who
had
come
up
early
to
the
quinta
mildred
and
miss
terry
were
all
seated
at
breakfast
in
a
room
that
looked
out
to
the
sea
which
although
the
wind
had
died
away
still
ran
rather
high
they
made
a
pretty
picture
as
they
sat
round
the
with
the
light
pouring
in
upon
them
from
the
open
windows
miss
terry
with
her
usual
expression
of
humoured
solemnity
pouring
out
the
tea
and
mildred
and
arthur
who
sat
exactly
opposite
to
each
other
drinking
it
never
had
the
former
looked
more
lovely
than
she
did
that
morning
dear
said
agatha
to
her
have
you
done
to
yourself
you
look
i
dear
then
it
is
because
i
am
agatha
was
quite
right
thought
arthur
she
did
look
beautiful
there
was
such
depth
and
rest
in
her
clear
eyes
such
a
wealth
of
happy
triumph
written
on
her
features
she
might
have
sat
that
morning
as
a
study
of
the
her
talk
too
was
as
bright
as
herself
she
laughed
and
shone
and
sparkled
like
the
on
the
bamboo
sprays
that
rocked
in
the
sunshine
and
whenever
she
addressed
herself
to
arthur
which
was
often
enough
every
sentence
seemed
wrapped
in
tender
meaning
her
whole
life
went
out
towards
him
a
palpable
thing
she
waited
on
his
words
and
basked
in
his
smile
mildred
carr
did
nothing
by
halves
arthur
was
the
least
cheerful
of
the
three
though
at
times
he
tried
his
best
to
join
in
merriment
any
one
who
knew
him
well
could
have
told
that
he
was
suffering
from
one
of
his
fits
of
constitutional
melancholy
and
a
physiognomist
looking
at
the
somewhat
dreamy
eyes
and
pensive
face
would
probably
have
added
that
he
neither
was
nor
ever
would
be
an
entirely
happy
man
by
degrees
however
he
seemed
to
get
the
better
of
his
thoughts
whatever
they
might
be
arthur
if
you
are
quite
awake
began
or
rather
went
on
mildred
you
will
come
to
the
window
i
have
something
to
show
i
am
at
your
service
what
may
it
be
now
look
do
you
see
that
little
vessel
in
the
bay
beneath
there
to
the
right
of
leeuw
rock
and
uncommonly
pretty
she
is
what
of
her
of
her
why
she
is
my
yacht
gracious
mildred
you
mean
to
say
that
been
buying
a
yacht
and
told
me
nothing
about
it
just
think
well
i
call
that
my
dear
agatha
i
have
a
yacht
and
a
crew
and
the
very
prettiest
saloon
in
the
world
and
that
you
will
think
it
an
honour
to
be
in
and
a
galley
with
bright
copper
fittings
and
a
cook
with
a
white
cap
and
gear
if
you
care
to
use
it
goodness
sake
overwhelm
us
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
your
white
elephant
now
that
you
have
got
it
with
it
why
ride
on
it
of
course
and
gentlemen
or
rather
and
attention
you
will
both
be
in
marching
or
rather
in
sailing
order
by
four
this
afternoon
for
at
five
we
start
for
the
canaries
now
no
remarks
a
skipper
and
i
expect
to
be
obeyed
or
put
you
in
done
that
already
said
arthur
i
go
and
dear
you
mean
that
you
are
afraid
of
being
flat
but
agatha
seriously
you
must
come
nobody
is
sick
in
those
waters
and
if
you
i
suppose
it
would
not
be
quite
the
thing
for
arthur
and
i
to
go
alone
and
then
my
dear
just
think
what
a
splendid
place
the
canaries
must
be
for
asked
agatha
solemnly
of
all
the
little
birds
it
has
to
i
thought
they
lived
on
in
their
native
i
suppose
i
must
go
but
i
really
believe
that
you
will
kill
me
with
your
mania
for
mildred
i
suppose
you
will
take
to
ballooning
is
by
no
means
a
bad
idea
i
should
like
to
see
you
in
a
balloon
i
know
where
to
draw
the
line
into
a
balloon
i
will
never
go
i
have
been
into
a
madeira
sledge
and
that
is
quite
enough
for
me
i
always
dream
about
it
twice
a
my
dear
i
promise
never
to
ask
you
when
i
want
to
go
ballooning
arthur
and
i
will
go
by
ourselves
it
would
be
a
grand
opportunity
for
a
and
now
go
and
see
about
getting
the
things
a
dear
and
arthur
do
you
send
john
down
to
for
your
i
better
go
and
see
about
it
myself
not
i
want
you
to
help
me
and
come
down
and
talk
to
the
skipper
for
he
will
be
under
your
orders
you
know
he
is
such
a
delightful
perfect
down
to
his
quid
and
always
says
ay
in
the
orthodox
fashion
certainly
you
must
not
go
i
will
not
trust
you
out
of
my
might
run
away
and
leave
me
alone
and
then
what
should
i
do
arthur
laughed
and
acquiesced
sitting
down
he
wrote
a
note
asking
the
manager
of
the
hotel
to
send
his
things
up
to
the
quinta
carr
together
with
his
account
as
he
was
leaving
madeira
for
the
present
the
rest
of
the
morning
was
spent
by
everybody
in
busy
preparation
boxes
were
packed
and
provisions
shipped
sufficient
to
victual
an
arctic
expedition
at
last
everything
was
ready
and
at
a
little
after
three
they
went
down
the
steps
leading
to
the
tiny
bay
and
embarking
on
the
smart
boat
that
was
waiting
for
them
were
conveyed
in
safety
to
the
for
such
was
the
name
arthur
suggested
that
it
should
be
changed
to
the
and
got
snubbed
for
his
pains
the
was
a
beautiful
craft
built
on
fine
lines
but
for
all
that
a
wonderful
boat
in
a
heavy
sea
she
was
a
schooner
forward
of
large
beam
her
fittings
below
were
perfect
down
to
the
painted
panels
after
watteau
in
the
saloon
and
the
electric
bells
and
she
was
rigged
either
to
sail
or
steam
as
might
be
most
convenient
on
the
present
occasion
as
there
was
not
the
slightest
hurry
and
no
danger
of
a
it
was
determined
that
they
should
not
avail
themselves
of
the
so
the
propeller
was
hoisted
up
and
everything
got
ready
for
that
most
delightful
thing
a
long
cruise
under
canvas
arthur
was
perfectly
charmed
with
everything
he
saw
and
so
was
agatha
terry
until
they
got
under
way
when
she
discovered
that
a
steamer
was
a
joke
compared
with
the
yacht
in
the
matter
of
motion
in
short
the
unfortunate
agatha
was
soon
reduced
to
her
normal
condition
of
torpor
mildred
always
declared
that
she
hibernated
on
board
ship
like
a
dormouse
or
a
bear
she
was
not
very
she
simply
lay
and
slept
eating
very
little
and
thinking
not
at
all
the
way
said
arthur
as
they
sailed
out
of
the
bay
never
gave
any
directions
about
my
that
will
not
matter
answered
mildred
carelessly
for
they
were
leaning
over
the
taffrail
together
will
keep
them
for
you
at
but
my
dear
boy
do
you
know
what
time
it
is
ten
minutes
to
seven
that
dreadful
bell
will
be
going
in
a
minute
and
the
soup
will
be
spoiled
run
and
get
ready
chapter
lxv
when
dinner
was
terry
would
have
went
and
sat
upon
the
moonlit
deck
the
little
vessel
was
under
all
her
canvas
for
the
breeze
was
light
and
skimmed
over
the
water
like
a
gull
with
its
wings
spread
in
the
low
light
madeira
was
nothing
but
a
blot
on
the
the
crew
were
forward
with
the
solitary
exception
of
the
man
steering
the
vessel
from
his
elevated
position
on
the
bridge
and
sitting
as
they
were
abaft
the
the
two
were
utterly
alone
between
the
great
silence
of
the
stars
and
of
the
sea
she
looked
into
his
face
and
it
was
tender
towards
night
was
made
for
tears
of
happiness
stood
in
her
eyes
she
took
his
hand
in
hers
and
her
head
nestled
upon
his
breast
should
like
to
sail
on
for
ever
so
quite
alone
with
you
i
never
again
wish
to
see
the
land
or
the
sun
or
any
other
sea
than
this
or
any
other
eyes
than
yours
to
hear
any
more
of
the
things
that
i
have
known
to
learn
to
know
any
fresh
things
if
i
could
choose
i
would
ask
that
i
might
now
glide
gently
from
your
arms
into
those
of
eternal
sleep
oh
arthur
i
am
so
happy
happy
that
i
scarcely
dare
to
speak
for
fear
lest
i
should
break
the
spell
and
i
feel
so
much
nearer
heaven
when
i
think
of
all
my
past
life
it
seems
like
a
stupid
dream
full
of
little
nothings
of
which
i
can
not
recall
any
memory
except
that
they
were
empty
and
without
meaning
but
the
future
is
worse
than
the
past
because
it
looks
fair
and
snakes
always
hide
in
flowers
it
makes
me
afraid
how
do
i
know
what
the
future
will
bring
i
wish
that
the
pleasant
certain
present
that
i
hold
with
my
last
for
does
know
mildred
if
the
human
race
could
see
the
pleasant
surprises
in
store
for
it
individually
i
believe
that
it
would
drown
itself
who
has
not
sometimes
caught
at
the
skirt
of
and
cried
a
not
let
come
yet
you
know
the
temps
suspends
ton
vol
et
vous
heures
propices
suspendez
votre
cours
laissez
nous
savourer
les
rapides
delices
des
plus
beaux
de
nos
only
crystallized
a
universal
aspiration
when
he
wrote
arthur
i
tell
you
of
love
and
happiness
wide
as
the
great
sea
round
us
and
you
talk
of
it
is
the
first
cold
breath
from
that
future
that
i
fear
oh
dear
i
do
not
know
how
i
should
you
ask
me
again
i
shall
ever
with
a
clear
conscience
be
able
to
say
i
will
marry
dear
i
asked
you
to
be
my
wife
last
night
and
what
i
said
then
i
say
again
now
in
any
case
until
you
dismiss
me
i
consider
myself
bound
to
you
but
i
tell
you
frankly
that
i
should
myself
prefer
that
you
would
marry
me
for
both
our
cold
and
correct
you
are
how
clearly
you
realize
the
position
in
which
i
am
likely
to
be
put
and
in
what
a
gentlemanlike
way
you
assure
me
that
your
honour
will
always
keep
you
bound
to
me
that
is
a
weak
thread
arthur
in
matters
of
the
heart
let
angela
reappear
as
my
honour
keep
you
to
my
side
honour
forsooth
it
is
like
a
bogey
in
the
is
a
shibboleth
men
use
to
frighten
naughty
women
with
which
for
themselves
is
almost
devoid
of
meaning
even
in
this
light
i
can
see
your
face
flush
at
her
name
what
chance
shall
i
ever
have
against
her
not
speak
of
her
mildred
let
her
memory
be
dead
between
us
she
who
belonged
to
me
before
god
and
whom
i
believed
in
as
i
believe
in
my
god
she
offered
me
the
most
deadly
insult
that
a
woman
can
offer
to
a
man
she
sold
herself
what
do
i
care
what
the
price
was
whether
it
were
money
or
position
or
convenience
or
the
approbation
of
her
surroundings
the
result
is
the
same
never
mention
her
name
to
me
again
i
tell
you
that
i
hate
a
tirade
there
is
warmth
enough
about
you
now
i
shall
be
careful
how
i
touch
on
the
subject
again
but
your
very
energy
shows
that
you
are
deceiving
yourself
i
wish
i
could
hear
you
speak
of
me
like
that
because
then
i
should
know
you
loved
me
oh
if
she
only
knew
has
her
revenge
for
all
your
bitter
words
you
are
lashed
to
her
arthur
you
do
hate
her
on
the
contrary
you
still
long
to
see
her
face
it
is
still
your
secret
and
most
cherished
hope
that
you
will
meet
her
again
either
in
this
or
another
world
you
love
her
as
much
as
ever
if
she
were
dead
you
could
bear
it
but
the
sharpest
sting
of
your
suffering
lies
in
the
humiliating
sense
that
you
are
forced
to
worship
a
god
you
know
to
be
false
and
to
give
your
own
pure
love
to
a
woman
whom
you
see
he
put
his
hands
to
his
face
and
groaned
aloud
are
right
he
said
would
rather
have
known
her
dead
than
know
her
as
she
is
but
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
bore
you
with
all
you
are
nothing
if
not
considerate
and
i
do
not
pretend
that
this
is
a
very
pleasant
conversation
for
me
but
i
began
it
so
i
suppose
i
must
endure
to
see
you
groaning
for
another
woman
you
say
she
went
on
with
a
sudden
flash
of
passion
you
should
like
to
see
her
dead
i
say
that
i
should
like
to
kill
her
for
she
has
struck
me
a
double
has
injured
you
whom
i
love
and
she
has
beggared
me
of
your
affection
oh
arthur
she
continued
changing
her
voice
and
throwing
a
caressing
arm
about
his
neck
you
no
heart
left
to
give
is
there
no
lingering
spark
that
can
cherish
and
blow
to
flame
i
will
never
treat
you
so
dear
learn
to
love
me
and
i
will
marry
you
and
make
you
happy
make
you
forget
this
faithless
woman
with
the
angel
face
i
here
her
voice
broke
down
in
sobs
and
in
the
starlight
the
great
tears
glistened
upon
her
face
like
on
a
blushing
rind
there
dear
i
will
try
to
forget
cry
and
he
touched
her
on
the
forehead
with
his
lips
she
stopped
and
then
said
with
just
the
faintest
tinge
of
bitterness
in
her
voice
it
had
been
angela
who
cried
you
would
not
be
so
cold
you
would
have
kissed
away
her
who
can
say
what
hidden
chord
of
feeling
those
words
touched
or
what
memories
they
awoke
but
their
effect
upon
arthur
was
striking
he
sprang
up
upon
the
deck
his
eyes
blazing
and
his
face
white
with
anger
often
he
said
i
forbid
you
to
mention
the
name
of
that
woman
to
me
do
you
take
a
pleasure
in
torturing
me
curse
her
may
she
eat
out
her
empty
heart
in
solitude
and
find
no
living
thing
to
comfort
her
may
she
suffer
as
she
makes
me
suffer
till
her
life
becomes
a
quiet
arthur
it
is
shameful
to
say
such
he
stopped
and
after
the
sharp
ring
of
his
voice
that
echoed
like
the
cry
wrung
from
a
person
in
intense
pain
the
loneliness
and
quiet
of
the
night
were
very
deep
and
then
an
answer
came
to
his
mad
unmanly
imprecations
for
suddenly
the
air
round
them
was
filled
with
the
sound
of
his
own
name
uttered
in
such
wild
despairing
accents
as
once
heard
were
not
likely
to
be
forgotten
accents
which
seemed
to
be
around
them
and
over
them
and
heard
in
their
own
brains
and
yet
to
come
travelling
from
immeasurable
distances
across
the
waste
of
waters
arthur
the
sound
that
had
sprung
from
nothing
died
away
into
nothingness
again
and
the
moonlight
glanced
and
the
waters
heaved
and
gave
no
sign
of
the
place
of
its
birth
it
had
come
and
gone
awful
untraceable
and
in
the
place
of
its
solemnity
reigned
silence
absolute
they
looked
at
each
other
with
scared
eyes
i
am
a
living
man
that
voice
was
this
was
all
he
said
chapter
lxvi
williamson
was
a
rising
young
practitioner
at
roxham
and
what
is
more
a
gentleman
and
a
doctor
of
real
ability
on
the
night
that
lady
bellamy
took
the
poison
he
sat
up
very
late
till
the
dawn
in
fact
working
up
his
books
of
reference
with
a
view
to
making
himself
as
much
the
master
as
possible
of
the
symptoms
and
most
approved
treatment
in
such
cases
of
insanity
as
appeared
to
resemble
angela
he
had
been
called
in
to
see
her
by
fraser
and
had
come
away
intensely
interested
from
a
medical
point
of
view
and
very
much
puzzled
at
length
he
shut
up
his
books
with
a
like
most
books
though
full
of
generalities
they
did
not
tell
him
went
to
bed
before
he
had
been
asleep
very
long
however
the
surgery
bell
was
violently
rung
and
having
dressed
himself
with
the
rapidity
characteristic
of
doctors
and
schoolboys
he
descended
to
find
a
frightened
footman
waiting
outside
from
whom
he
gathered
that
something
dreadful
had
happened
to
lady
bellamy
who
had
been
found
lying
apparently
dead
upon
the
floor
of
her
providing
himself
with
some
powerful
restoratives
and
a
portable
electric
battery
he
drove
rapidly
over
to
rewtham
house
here
he
found
the
patient
laid
upon
a
sofa
in
the
room
where
she
had
been
found
and
surrounded
by
a
mob
of
terrified
and
servants
at
first
he
thought
life
was
quite
extinct
but
presently
he
fancied
that
he
could
detect
a
faint
tremor
of
the
heart
he
applied
the
most
powerful
of
his
restoratives
and
administered
a
sharp
current
from
the
battery
and
after
a
considerable
time
was
rewarded
by
seeing
the
patient
open
her
only
to
shut
them
again
immediately
directing
his
assistant
to
continue
the
treatment
he
tried
to
elicit
some
information
from
the
servants
as
to
what
had
happened
but
all
he
could
gather
was
that
the
maid
had
received
a
message
not
to
sit
up
this
made
him
suspicious
of
an
attempt
at
suicide
and
just
then
his
eye
fell
upon
a
wineglass
that
lay
upon
the
floor
broken
at
the
shank
he
took
it
up
in
the
bowl
there
was
still
a
drop
or
two
of
liquid
he
smelt
it
then
dipped
his
finger
in
and
tasted
it
with
the
result
that
his
tongue
was
burnt
and
became
rough
and
numb
then
his
suspicions
were
confirmed
presently
lady
bellamy
opened
her
eyes
again
and
this
time
there
was
intelligence
in
them
she
gazed
round
her
with
a
wondering
air
next
she
spoke
am
i
your
own
lady
bellamy
be
quiet
now
you
will
be
better
she
tried
first
to
move
her
head
then
her
arm
then
her
lower
limbs
but
they
would
not
stir
by
this
time
her
faculties
were
wide
awake
you
the
doctor
she
said
lady
tell
me
why
can
not
i
move
my
he
lifted
her
hand
it
fell
again
like
a
lump
of
williamson
looked
very
grave
then
he
applied
a
current
of
electricity
you
feel
that
he
asked
she
shook
her
head
can
not
i
move
do
not
trifle
with
me
tell
me
williamson
was
a
young
man
and
had
not
quite
conquered
nervousness
in
his
confusion
he
muttered
something
about
is
it
that
i
am
not
dead
have
brought
you
back
to
life
but
pray
do
not
fool
why
could
you
not
let
me
die
you
mean
that
you
have
brought
my
mind
to
life
and
left
my
body
dead
i
feel
now
that
i
am
quite
he
could
not
answer
her
what
she
said
was
only
too
true
and
his
look
told
her
so
she
gazed
steadily
at
him
for
a
moment
as
he
bent
over
her
and
realized
all
the
horrors
of
her
position
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
her
proud
spirit
absolutely
gave
way
for
a
few
seconds
she
was
silent
and
then
without
any
change
coming
over
the
expression
of
her
the
wild
gaze
with
which
she
had
faced
eternity
was
for
ever
frozen
broke
out
into
a
succession
of
the
most
shrieks
that
it
had
ever
been
his
lot
to
listen
to
at
last
she
stopped
exhausted
me
she
whispered
hoarsely
me
it
was
a
dreadful
scene
as
the
doctors
afterwards
concluded
rightly
or
wrongly
a
very
curious
thing
had
happened
to
lady
bellamy
either
the
poison
she
had
they
were
never
able
to
discover
what
its
exact
nature
was
nor
would
she
enlighten
grown
less
deadly
during
all
the
years
that
she
had
kept
it
or
she
had
partially
defeated
her
object
by
taking
an
overdose
or
as
seemed
more
probable
there
was
some
acid
in
the
wine
in
which
it
had
been
mixed
that
had
had
the
strange
effect
of
rendering
it
to
a
certain
degree
innocuous
its
result
however
was
as
she
guessed
to
render
her
a
hopeless
paralytic
for
life
at
length
the
patient
sank
into
the
coma
of
exhaustion
and
williamson
was
able
to
leave
her
in
the
care
of
a
brother
practitioner
whom
he
had
sent
for
and
in
that
of
his
assistant
sir
john
had
been
sent
for
but
had
not
arrived
it
was
then
eleven
and
at
one
the
doctor
was
summoned
as
a
witness
to
attend
the
inquest
on
george
caresfoot
he
had
therefore
two
hours
at
his
disposal
and
these
he
determined
to
utilise
by
driving
round
to
see
angela
who
was
still
lying
at
vicarage
fraser
heard
him
coming
and
met
him
in
the
little
drive
he
briefly
told
him
what
he
had
just
seen
and
what
in
his
opinion
lady
fate
must
of
living
death
the
remark
was
characteristic
yet
he
said
are
people
in
the
world
who
say
that
there
is
no
is
caresfoot
asked
the
doctor
had
a
dreadful
fit
of
raving
this
morning
and
we
had
to
tie
her
down
in
bed
she
is
quieter
now
poor
dear
there
listen
at
that
moment
through
the
open
window
of
the
bedroom
they
heard
a
sweet
though
untrained
voice
beginning
to
sing
it
was
and
she
was
singing
snatches
of
an
one
of
several
which
arthur
had
taught
her
ye
well
and
adieu
to
all
you
spanish
ladies
fare
ye
well
and
adieu
to
ye
ladies
of
spain
for
received
orders
to
return
to
old
england
but
we
hope
in
a
short
time
to
see
you
again
hove
our
ship
to
with
the
wind
at
my
boys
we
hove
our
ship
to
for
to
strike
soundings
clear
it
was
fathom
and
a
grey
sandy
bottom
then
we
filled
our
main
topsail
and
up
channel
did
steer
signal
was
made
for
the
grand
fleet
to
anchor
all
in
the
downs
that
night
for
to
meet
so
cast
off
your
let
go
your
hawl
up
your
let
fly
tack
and
without
waiting
to
hear
any
more
they
went
up
the
stairs
and
entered
the
bedroom
the
first
person
they
saw
was
pigott
who
had
been
sent
for
to
nurse
angela
standing
by
the
side
of
the
bed
and
a
trained
nurse
at
a
little
table
at
the
foot
mixing
some
medicine
on
the
bed
itself
lay
angela
shorn
of
all
her
beautiful
hair
her
face
flushed
as
with
fever
except
where
a
blue
weal
bore
witness
to
the
blow
from
her
cruel
whip
her
head
thrown
back
and
a
strange
light
in
her
wild
eyes
she
was
tied
down
in
the
bed
with
a
broad
stretched
across
her
breast
but
she
had
wrenched
one
arm
free
and
with
it
was
beating
time
to
her
song
on
the
she
caught
sight
of
fraser
at
once
and
seemed
to
recognize
him
for
she
stopped
her
singing
and
laughed
a
pretty
old
song
it
she
said
taught
it
me
was
it
long
while
ago
but
i
know
know
another
like
it
you
are
a
clergyman
you
and
she
began
again
the
parson
one
day
as
i
cursed
a
jew
now
do
you
not
know
that
that
is
a
sin
of
you
sailors
i
fear
there
are
but
a
few
that
peter
to
heaven
will
ever
let
in
i
parson
to
tell
you
my
mind
few
sailors
to
knock
were
ever
yet
seen
those
who
travel
by
land
may
steer
against
wind
but
we
shape
a
course
for
suddenly
she
stopped
and
her
mind
wandered
off
to
the
scene
of
two
days
previous
with
arthur
by
the
lake
and
she
began
to
quote
the
words
wrung
from
the
bitterness
of
his
heart
miserable
woman
do
you
know
what
you
are
shame
upon
you
were
you
not
married
yesterday
it
is
quite
true
yes
quite
true
say
what
you
like
of
me
deserve
it
all
but
oh
arthur
i
love
you
so
be
hard
upon
love
you
so
dear
kill
me
if
you
like
dear
but
talk
to
me
so
i
shall
go
shall
go
mad
and
she
broke
into
a
flood
of
weeping
dear
she
has
been
going
on
like
that
off
and
on
all
night
it
clean
broke
my
heart
to
see
it
and
the
holy
truth
and
pigott
looked
very
much
as
though
she
were
going
to
cry
herself
by
this
time
angela
had
ceased
weeping
and
was
brooding
sullenly
with
her
face
buried
in
the
pillow
is
absolutely
nothing
to
be
done
said
the
doctor
can
only
trust
to
her
fine
constitution
and
youth
to
pull
her
through
she
has
received
a
series
of
dreadful
mental
shocks
and
it
is
very
doubtful
if
she
will
ever
get
over
them
it
is
a
pity
to
think
that
such
a
splendid
creature
may
become
permanently
insane
is
it
not
you
must
be
very
careful
pigott
that
she
does
not
do
herself
an
injury
she
is
just
in
the
state
that
she
may
throw
herself
out
of
the
window
or
cut
her
throat
and
now
i
must
be
going
i
will
call
in
again
fraser
accompanied
him
down
to
the
gate
where
he
had
left
his
trap
before
they
got
out
of
the
front
door
angela
had
roused
herself
again
and
they
could
hear
her
beginning
to
quote
homer
and
then
breaking
out
into
snatches
of
her
aloft
amongst
the
rigging
sings
the
loud
exulting
like
me
i
sing
too
and
then
followed
peal
upon
peal
of
mad
laughter
very
sad
case
she
has
a
poor
chance
i
fraser
was
too
much
affected
to
answer
him
chapter
lxvii
public
feeling
in
marlshire
was
much
excited
about
the
caresfoot
tragedy
and
when
it
became
known
that
lady
bellamy
had
attempted
to
commit
suicide
the
excitement
was
trebled
it
is
not
often
that
the
dullest
and
most
highly
respectable
part
of
an
eminently
dull
and
respectable
county
gets
such
a
chance
of
cheerful
and
interesting
conversation
as
these
two
events
gave
rise
to
we
may
be
sure
that
the
godsend
was
duly
appreciated
indeed
the
whole
story
is
up
to
this
hour
a
favourite
subject
of
conversation
in
those
parts
of
course
the
members
of
the
polite
society
of
the
neighbourhood
of
roxham
were
divided
into
two
camps
the
men
all
thought
that
angela
had
been
shamefully
treated
the
elder
and
most
intensely
respectable
ladies
for
the
most
part
inclined
to
the
other
side
of
the
question
it
not
being
their
habit
to
look
at
matters
from
the
same
point
of
view
in
which
they
present
themselves
to
a
nicer
sense
of
honour
they
could
see
no
great
harm
in
george
stratagems
a
man
so
rich
they
argued
was
perfectly
entitled
to
buy
his
wife
the
marriage
had
been
arranged
like
their
own
on
the
soundest
property
basis
and
the
woman
who
rose
in
rebellion
against
a
husband
merely
because
she
loved
another
man
or
some
such
romantic
nonsense
deserved
all
she
got
gone
mad
had
she
it
was
a
warning
and
these
aristocratic
matrons
sniffed
and
turned
up
their
noses
they
felt
that
angela
by
going
mad
and
creating
a
public
excitement
had
entered
a
mute
protest
against
the
recognized
rules
of
marriage
as
practised
in
this
zululand
having
daughters
to
dispose
of
they
resented
this
and
poor
angela
was
for
years
afterwards
spoken
of
among
them
as
that
but
the
lower
and
more
human
strata
of
society
did
not
sympathize
with
this
feeling
on
the
contrary
they
were
all
for
angela
and
the
dog
aleck
who
was
supposed
to
have
chocked
that
warmint
george
the
inquest
on
body
was
held
at
roxham
and
was
the
object
of
the
greatest
possible
interest
indeed
the
public
excitement
was
so
great
that
the
coroner
was
perhaps
insensibly
influenced
by
it
and
allowed
the
inquiry
to
travel
a
little
beyond
its
professed
object
of
ascertaining
the
actual
cause
of
death
with
the
result
that
many
of
the
details
of
the
wicked
plot
from
which
angela
had
been
the
principal
sufferer
became
public
property
needless
to
say
that
they
did
not
soothe
the
feelings
of
an
excited
crowd
when
philip
after
spending
one
of
the
worst
of
his
life
in
the
at
length
escaped
with
such
shreds
of
reputation
as
he
had
hitherto
possessed
altogether
torn
off
his
back
his
greeting
from
the
mob
outside
the
court
may
fairly
be
described
as
a
warm
one
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
he
found
himself
at
one
end
of
a
long
lane
that
was
hedged
on
both
sides
by
faces
not
without
a
touch
of
ferocity
about
them
and
with
difficulty
kept
clear
by
the
available
force
of
the
five
roxham
policemen
sold
his
daughter
shouted
a
great
fellow
in
his
ear
me
come
a
dear
man
and
have
a
look
at
judas
said
a
skinny
little
woman
with
a
squint
to
an
individual
who
blocked
her
view
the
crowd
caught
at
the
word
it
shouted
and
hang
yourself
judas
judas
how
philip
got
out
of
that
he
never
quite
knew
but
he
did
get
out
somehow
meanwhile
sir
john
bellamy
was
being
examined
in
court
and
notwithstanding
the
almost
aggressive
innocence
of
his
appearance
he
was
not
having
a
very
good
time
it
chanced
that
he
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
rival
lawyer
who
hated
him
like
poison
and
had
good
reason
to
hate
him
it
is
wonderful
by
the
way
how
enemies
do
spring
up
round
a
man
in
trouble
like
dogs
who
bite
a
wounded
companion
to
death
and
on
the
same
principle
he
is
defenceless
this
gentleman
would
insist
on
conducting
the
examination
on
the
basis
that
he
knew
all
about
the
fraud
practised
with
reference
to
the
supposed
death
of
arthur
heigham
now
it
will
be
remembered
that
sir
john
in
his
last
interview
with
lady
bellamy
had
declared
that
there
was
no
tittle
of
evidence
against
him
and
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
implicate
him
in
the
exposure
that
must
overtake
her
to
a
certain
extent
he
was
right
but
on
one
point
he
had
overshot
himself
for
at
that
very
inquest
fraser
stated
on
oath
that
he
fraser
had
spoken
of
arthur
death
in
the
presence
of
sir
john
bellamy
and
had
not
been
contradicted
in
vain
did
sir
john
protest
that
fraser
must
be
mistaken
both
the
jury
and
the
public
looked
at
the
probabilities
of
the
matter
and
though
his
protestations
were
accepted
in
silence
when
he
left
the
there
was
not
a
man
in
court
but
was
morally
certain
that
he
had
been
privy
to
the
plot
and
so
far
as
reputation
was
concerned
he
was
a
ruined
man
and
yet
legally
there
was
not
a
jot
of
evidence
against
him
but
public
opinion
required
that
a
scapegoat
should
be
found
and
it
was
now
his
lot
to
figure
as
that
unlucky
animal
by
the
time
he
reached
the
exit
into
the
street
the
impression
that
he
had
had
a
hand
in
the
business
had
in
some
mysterious
way
communicated
itself
to
the
mob
outside
many
a
member
of
which
had
some
old
grudge
to
settle
with
bellamy
if
only
chance
put
an
opportunity
in
their
way
as
he
stepped
through
the
door
utterly
ignorant
of
the
greeting
which
awaited
him
his
ears
were
assailed
by
an
awful
yell
followed
by
a
storm
of
hoots
and
hisses
sir
john
turned
pale
and
looked
for
a
means
of
escape
but
the
policeman
who
had
let
him
out
had
locked
the
door
behind
him
and
all
round
him
was
the
angry
mob
comes
the
that
started
the
swim
roared
a
voice
as
soon
as
there
was
a
momentary
lull
piped
sir
john
with
all
the
pippin
hue
gone
from
his
cheeks
and
rubbing
his
white
hands
together
nervously
he
poisoned
his
own
poor
wife
shouted
a
woman
with
a
baby
went
on
sir
john
in
agonized
tones
him
yelled
a
sweet
little
boy
of
ten
or
so
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
and
planting
a
rotten
egg
full
upon
sir
imposing
brow
no
said
the
woman
who
had
nicknamed
philip
you
drop
him
in
the
pond
only
two
feet
of
water
and
soft
falling
on
the
mud
you
can
pelt
him
the
idea
was
received
with
acclamation
and
notwithstanding
his
own
efforts
to
the
contrary
backed
as
they
were
by
those
of
the
five
policemen
before
he
knew
where
he
was
sir
john
found
himself
being
hustled
by
a
lot
of
sturdy
fellows
towards
the
filthy
like
an
aristocrat
to
the
guillotine
they
soon
arrived
and
then
followed
the
most
painful
experience
of
all
his
life
one
of
which
the
very
thought
would
ever
afterwards
move
him
most
profoundly
two
strong
men
utterly
heedless
of
his
yells
and
lamentations
took
him
by
the
heels
and
two
yet
stronger
than
they
caught
him
by
his
plump
and
tender
wrists
and
then
under
the
directions
of
the
woman
with
the
squint
they
began
to
swing
him
from
side
to
side
as
soon
as
the
lady
directress
considered
that
the
impetus
was
sufficient
she
said
and
away
he
went
like
a
swallow
only
to
land
when
his
flying
powers
were
exhausted
plump
in
the
middle
of
the
some
ten
seconds
afterwards
a
pillar
of
slimy
mud
arose
and
staggered
towards
the
bank
where
a
crowd
of
little
boys
each
holding
something
offensive
in
his
right
hand
were
eagerly
awaiting
its
arrival
the
woman
contemplated
the
figure
with
the
most
intense
satisfaction
sold
me
up
once
she
murmured
quits
now
it
lads
let
him
have
but
we
will
drop
a
veil
over
this
too
painful
scene
sir
john
bellamy
was
unwell
for
some
days
afterwards
when
he
recovered
he
shook
the
dust
of
roxham
off
his
shoes
for
ever
chapter
lxviii
a
fortnight
or
so
afterwards
when
the
public
excitement
occasioned
by
the
caresfoot
tragedy
had
been
partially
eclipsed
by
a
particularly
thrilling
and
suicide
a
change
for
the
better
took
place
in
condition
one
night
after
an
unusually
violent
fit
of
raving
she
suddenly
went
to
sleep
about
twelve
and
slept
all
that
night
and
all
the
next
day
about
nine
on
the
following
evening
the
watchers
in
her
pigott
fraser
and
williamson
who
was
trying
to
make
out
what
this
deep
sleep
were
suddenly
astonished
at
seeing
her
sit
up
in
her
bed
in
a
listening
attitude
as
though
she
could
hear
something
that
interested
her
intensely
for
the
webbing
that
tied
her
down
had
been
temporarily
removed
and
then
cry
in
a
tone
of
the
most
living
anguish
and
yet
with
a
world
of
passionate
remonstrance
in
her
voice
arthur
then
she
sank
down
again
for
a
few
minutes
it
was
the
same
night
that
mildred
and
arthur
sat
together
on
the
deck
of
the
presently
she
opened
her
eyes
and
the
doctor
saw
that
there
was
no
longer
any
madness
in
them
only
great
trouble
her
glance
first
fell
upon
pigott
she
said
and
stop
him
he
can
not
have
gone
far
bring
him
back
to
me
quick
or
he
will
be
do
you
mean
dear
of
angela
said
fraser
has
been
gone
a
long
time
you
have
been
very
she
did
not
say
anything
but
turned
her
face
to
the
pillow
and
wept
apparently
as
much
from
exhaustion
as
from
any
other
cause
and
then
dropped
off
to
sleep
again
reason
is
saved
said
williamson
as
soon
as
they
were
outside
the
door
be
to
providence
and
you
to
providence
alone
it
is
a
case
in
which
i
could
do
little
or
nothing
it
is
a
most
merciful
deliverance
all
that
you
have
to
do
now
is
to
keep
her
perfectly
quiet
and
above
all
do
not
let
her
father
come
near
her
at
present
i
will
call
in
and
tell
him
lady
bellamy
oh
about
the
same
she
is
a
strange
woman
she
never
complains
and
rarely
twice
i
have
heard
her
break
out
shockingly
there
will
never
be
any
alteration
in
her
case
till
the
last
alteration
i
will
look
round
after
this
recovery
was
comparatively
speaking
rapid
though
of
course
the
effects
of
so
severe
a
shock
to
the
nervous
system
could
not
be
shaken
off
in
a
day
though
she
was
no
longer
mad
she
was
still
in
a
disturbed
state
of
mind
and
subject
to
strange
dreams
or
visions
one
in
particular
that
visited
her
several
nights
in
succession
made
a
great
impression
upon
her
first
it
would
seem
to
her
that
she
was
wide
awake
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
there
would
creep
over
her
a
sense
of
unmeasured
space
infinite
silence
and
intense
solitude
she
would
think
that
she
was
standing
on
a
dais
at
the
end
of
a
vast
hall
down
which
ran
endless
rows
of
pillars
supporting
an
inky
sky
which
was
the
roof
there
was
no
light
in
the
hall
yet
she
could
clearly
see
there
was
no
sound
but
she
could
hear
the
silence
only
a
soft
radiance
shone
from
her
eyes
and
brow
she
was
not
afraid
though
lonely
but
she
felt
that
something
would
presently
come
to
make
an
end
of
solitude
and
so
she
stood
for
many
years
or
could
not
tell
to
fathom
the
mystery
of
that
great
place
and
watching
the
light
that
streamed
from
her
forehead
strike
upon
the
marble
floor
and
pillars
or
thread
the
darkness
like
a
shooting
star
only
to
reveal
new
depths
of
blackness
beyond
those
it
pierced
at
length
there
came
softly
falling
from
the
which
never
stirred
to
any
passing
breeze
a
flake
of
snow
larger
than
a
wing
but
it
was
and
in
its
centre
shone
a
wonderful
light
that
made
its
passage
through
the
darkness
a
track
of
glory
as
it
passed
gently
downwards
without
sound
she
thought
that
it
threw
the
shadow
of
a
human
face
it
lit
upon
the
marble
floor
and
the
red
snow
melted
there
and
turned
to
blood
but
the
light
that
had
been
its
heart
shone
on
pure
and
steady
looking
up
again
she
saw
that
the
vault
above
her
was
thick
with
thousands
upon
thousands
of
these
flakes
each
glowing
like
a
crimson
lamp
and
each
throwing
its
own
shadow
one
of
the
shadows
was
like
george
and
she
shuddered
as
it
passed
and
ever
as
they
touched
the
marble
pavement
the
flakes
melted
and
became
blood
and
some
of
the
lights
went
out
but
the
most
part
burnt
on
till
at
length
there
was
no
longer
any
floor
but
a
of
blood
on
which
floated
a
myriad
points
of
fire
and
then
it
all
grew
clear
to
her
for
a
voice
in
her
mind
spoke
and
said
that
this
was
one
of
storehouses
for
human
souls
that
the
light
was
the
soul
and
the
red
in
the
snow
which
turned
to
blood
was
the
sin
which
had
during
its
earthly
passage
stained
its
first
purity
the
sea
of
blood
before
her
was
the
sum
of
the
scarlet
wickedness
of
her
age
from
every
soul
there
came
some
to
swell
its
awful
waters
at
length
the
red
snow
ceased
to
fall
and
a
sound
that
was
not
a
voice
but
yet
spoke
pealed
through
the
silence
asking
if
all
were
ready
the
voice
that
had
spoken
in
her
mind
answered
he
has
not
come
who
is
to
then
looking
upwards
she
saw
miles
on
miles
away
a
bright
being
with
wings
flashing
fast
towards
her
and
she
knew
that
it
was
arthur
and
the
loneliness
left
her
he
lit
a
breathing
radiance
by
her
side
and
again
the
great
sound
pealed
in
the
living
waters
and
cleanse
away
the
sins
of
this
it
echoed
and
died
away
and
there
followed
a
tumult
like
the
flow
of
an
angry
sea
a
mighty
wind
swept
past
her
and
after
it
an
ocean
of
molten
crystal
came
rushing
through
the
illimitable
hall
the
sea
and
the
wind
purged
away
the
blood
and
put
out
the
lamps
leaving
behind
them
a
glow
of
light
like
that
upon
her
brow
and
where
the
lamps
had
been
stood
myriads
of
seraphic
beings
whilst
from
ten
thousand
tongues
ran
forth
a
paean
of
celestial
song
then
everything
vanished
and
deep
gloom
that
was
not
however
dark
to
her
settled
round
them
taking
arthur
by
the
hand
she
spread
her
white
wings
and
circled
upwards
far
far
they
sailed
till
they
reached
a
giant
peak
that
split
space
in
twain
here
they
alighted
and
watched
the
masses
of
cloud
tearing
through
the
gulfs
on
either
side
of
them
and
looking
beyond
and
below
gazed
upon
the
shining
worlds
that
peopled
space
beneath
them
from
the
to
the
right
and
left
came
a
noise
as
of
the
soughings
of
many
wings
but
they
did
not
know
what
caused
it
till
presently
the
vapours
lifted
and
they
saw
that
alongside
of
and
beneath
them
two
separate
streams
of
souls
were
passing
on
outstretched
pinions
one
stream
that
to
their
left
proceeding
to
their
earthly
homes
and
one
that
to
the
right
returning
from
them
those
who
went
wore
grief
upon
their
shadowy
faces
and
had
coloured
wings
but
those
who
returned
seemed
for
the
most
part
happy
and
their
wings
were
tipped
with
splendour
the
stream
that
came
flowed
from
a
glory
and
that
which
returned
having
passed
the
dividing
cliff
on
which
they
stood
was
changed
into
a
multitude
of
the
red
with
the
glowing
hearts
and
dropped
gently
downwards
so
they
stood
in
happy
peace
never
tiring
from
millennium
to
millennium
they
watched
new
worlds
collecting
out
of
chaos
they
saw
them
speed
upon
their
high
aerial
course
till
grown
hoary
their
crumbling
with
age
they
wasted
away
into
the
vastness
whence
they
had
gathered
to
be
replaced
by
fresh
creations
that
in
their
turn
took
form
teemed
with
life
waxed
waned
and
vanished
at
length
there
came
an
end
and
the
soughing
of
wings
was
silent
for
ever
no
more
souls
went
downwards
and
none
came
up
from
the
earths
then
the
distant
glory
from
which
the
souls
had
come
moved
towards
them
with
awful
mutterings
and
robed
in
lightning
and
space
was
filled
with
spirits
one
of
whom
sweeping
past
them
cried
with
a
loud
voice
time
is
dead
now
is
the
beginning
of
and
she
turned
to
arthur
who
had
grown
more
radiant
than
the
star
which
gleamed
upon
his
forehead
and
kissed
him
then
she
would
wake
time
passed
on
and
gradually
health
and
strength
came
back
to
angela
till
at
last
she
was
as
powerful
in
mind
that
were
except
that
she
was
shorn
of
her
lovely
hair
more
beautiful
in
body
than
she
had
been
before
her
troubles
overwhelmed
her
of
arthur
she
thought
a
great
she
thought
of
little
else
but
it
was
with
a
sort
of
hopelessness
that
precluded
action
nobody
had
mentioned
his
name
to
her
as
it
was
thought
wiser
not
to
do
so
though
pigott
and
fraser
had
in
as
gentle
terms
as
they
could
command
told
her
of
the
details
of
the
plot
against
her
and
of
the
consequences
to
the
principal
actors
in
it
nor
had
she
spoken
of
him
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
lost
him
for
good
that
he
could
never
come
back
to
her
after
what
had
passed
that
he
must
hate
her
too
much
she
supposed
that
in
acting
as
he
did
he
was
aware
of
all
the
circumstances
of
her
marriage
and
could
find
no
excuses
for
her
she
did
not
even
know
where
he
was
and
in
her
ignorance
of
the
uses
of
private
detectives
and
advertisements
had
no
idea
how
to
find
out
and
so
she
suffered
in
silence
and
only
saw
him
in
her
dreams
she
still
stopped
at
the
vicarage
with
pigott
nor
had
there
as
yet
been
any
talk
of
her
returning
to
the
abbey
house
indeed
she
had
not
seen
her
father
since
the
day
of
her
marriage
but
now
that
she
had
recovered
she
felt
that
something
must
be
done
about
it
wondering
what
it
should
be
she
one
afternoon
walked
to
the
churchyard
where
she
had
not
been
since
her
illness
and
once
there
made
her
way
naturally
to
her
grave
she
was
moving
very
quietly
and
had
almost
reached
the
tree
under
which
hilda
caresfoot
lay
when
she
became
aware
that
there
was
already
somebody
kneeling
by
the
grave
with
his
head
rested
against
the
marble
cross
it
was
her
father
her
shadow
falling
upon
him
he
turned
and
saw
her
and
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
she
was
shocked
at
the
dreadful
alteration
in
his
face
it
was
now
that
of
an
old
man
nearly
worn
out
with
suffering
he
put
his
hand
before
his
eyes
and
said
how
can
i
face
you
least
of
all
here
for
a
moment
the
memory
of
her
bitter
wrongs
swelled
in
her
heart
for
she
now
to
a
great
extent
understood
what
her
part
in
the
plot
had
been
and
she
regarded
him
in
silence
she
said
presently
have
been
in
the
hands
of
god
and
not
in
yours
and
though
you
have
helped
to
ruin
my
life
and
have
very
nearly
driven
me
into
a
madhouse
i
can
still
say
let
the
past
be
the
past
but
why
do
you
look
so
wretched
you
should
look
happy
you
have
got
the
price
you
know
and
she
laughed
a
little
bitterly
do
i
look
wretched
because
i
am
given
over
to
a
curse
that
you
can
not
understand
and
i
am
not
alone
where
are
those
who
plotted
against
you
george
dead
bellamy
gone
lady
bellamy
paralysed
hand
and
foot
and
i
did
not
plot
i
only
let
them
accursed
but
if
you
can
forget
the
past
why
do
you
not
come
back
to
my
house
of
course
i
can
not
force
you
you
are
free
and
rich
and
can
suit
will
come
for
a
time
if
you
i
can
bring
pigott
with
may
bring
twenty
pigotts
for
all
i
long
as
you
will
pay
for
their
board
he
added
with
a
touch
of
his
old
miserliness
what
do
you
mean
a
do
not
think
i
shall
stop
here
long
i
think
that
i
am
going
into
a
well
you
are
your
own
mistress
and
must
do
as
you
i
will
come
and
they
parted
chapter
lxix
and
so
on
the
following
day
angela
and
pigott
returned
to
the
abbey
house
but
they
both
felt
that
it
was
a
sad
indeed
if
there
had
been
no
other
cause
for
melancholy
the
sight
of
face
was
enough
to
excite
it
in
the
most
person
not
that
angela
saw
much
of
him
however
for
they
still
kept
to
their
old
habit
of
not
living
together
all
day
her
father
was
shut
up
in
his
room
transacting
business
that
had
reference
to
the
accession
of
his
property
and
the
settlement
of
affairs
for
his
cousin
had
died
intestate
so
he
took
his
personalty
and
wound
up
the
estate
as
at
night
however
he
would
go
out
and
walk
for
miles
and
in
all
seemed
to
dread
spending
the
dark
hours
at
home
when
angela
had
been
back
about
a
month
in
the
old
place
she
accidentally
got
a
curious
insight
into
her
mental
sufferings
it
so
happened
that
one
night
finding
it
impossible
to
sleep
and
being
much
oppressed
by
sorrowful
thoughts
she
thought
that
she
would
read
the
hours
away
but
the
particular
book
she
wanted
to
find
was
downstairs
and
it
was
two
in
the
morning
and
chilly
in
the
passages
however
anything
is
better
than
sleeplessness
and
the
tyranny
of
sad
thoughts
and
empty
longings
so
throwing
on
her
she
took
a
candle
and
set
off
thinking
as
she
went
how
she
had
in
the
same
guise
fled
before
her
husband
she
got
her
book
and
was
returning
when
she
saw
that
there
was
still
a
light
in
her
study
and
that
the
door
was
ajar
at
that
moment
it
so
happened
that
an
unusually
sharp
draught
coming
down
one
of
the
passages
of
the
rambling
old
house
caught
her
candle
and
extinguished
it
making
her
way
to
the
she
pushed
it
open
to
see
if
anybody
was
there
previous
to
asking
for
a
light
at
first
she
could
see
nobody
on
the
table
which
was
covered
with
papers
there
stood
two
candles
a
and
a
glass
she
was
just
moving
to
the
candle
to
get
a
light
when
her
eye
fell
on
what
she
at
first
believed
to
be
a
heap
of
clothes
huddled
together
on
the
floor
in
the
corner
of
the
room
further
examination
showed
that
it
was
a
could
distinctly
see
the
backs
of
his
hands
her
first
ideas
was
that
she
had
surprised
a
thief
and
she
stopped
feeling
frightened
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
just
then
the
bundle
straightened
itself
a
little
and
dropped
its
hands
revealing
to
her
wondering
gaze
her
own
face
which
wore
the
same
awful
look
of
abject
fear
which
she
had
seen
upon
it
when
he
passed
through
the
hall
beneath
her
just
before
isleworth
broke
into
flame
on
the
night
of
her
marriage
the
eyes
appeared
to
be
starting
from
the
sockets
in
an
effort
to
clearly
realize
an
undefinable
horror
the
hair
now
daily
growing
greyer
was
partially
erect
and
the
pallid
lips
opened
as
though
to
speak
words
that
would
not
come
he
saw
her
too
but
did
not
seem
surprised
at
her
presence
covering
up
his
eyes
again
with
one
hand
he
shrank
further
back
into
his
corner
and
with
the
other
pointed
to
a
large
leather
in
which
pigott
had
told
her
her
grandfather
had
died
there
he
whispered
hoarsely
father
i
see
girl
in
the
how
it
glares
at
me
angela
stood
aghast
she
was
alarmed
in
defiance
of
her
own
reason
and
began
to
catch
the
contagion
of
superstition
is
dreadful
she
said
sake
tell
me
what
is
the
ghastly
gaze
again
fixed
itself
on
the
chair
and
his
teeth
began
to
chatter
god
he
said
is
and
uttering
a
smothered
cry
he
fell
on
his
face
in
a
half
faint
the
necessity
for
action
brought
angela
to
herself
seizing
the
she
splashed
some
water
into
her
face
he
came
to
himself
almost
instantly
am
i
he
said
i
remember
i
have
not
been
quite
well
you
must
not
think
anything
of
that
what
are
you
doing
down
here
at
this
time
of
night
pass
me
that
bottle
and
he
took
nearly
half
a
tumbler
of
raw
brandy
i
am
quite
right
again
now
i
had
a
bad
attack
of
indigestion
that
is
all
good
angela
went
without
a
word
she
understood
now
what
her
father
had
meant
when
he
said
that
he
was
but
she
could
not
help
wondering
whether
the
brandy
had
anything
to
do
with
his
on
the
following
day
the
doctor
came
to
see
her
it
struck
angela
that
he
came
oftener
than
was
necessary
the
fact
being
that
he
would
gladly
have
attended
her
gratis
all
year
round
a
doctor
does
not
often
get
the
chance
of
visiting
such
a
patient
do
not
look
quite
so
well
he
said
she
answered
with
a
little
smile
had
bad
dreams
last
i
thought
so
you
should
try
to
avoid
that
sort
of
thing
you
are
far
too
imaginative
can
not
run
away
from
dreams
murder
will
out
in
i
have
a
message
for
from
bellamy
you
know
that
she
is
paralysed
she
wants
you
to
go
and
see
her
shall
you
go
angela
thought
a
little
and
answered
i
think
must
be
prepared
for
some
bitter
language
if
she
speaks
at
all
very
likely
she
will
beg
you
to
get
her
some
poison
to
kill
herself
with
i
have
been
obliged
to
take
the
greatest
precautions
to
prevent
her
from
obtaining
any
i
am
not
very
sensitive
but
once
or
twice
she
has
positively
made
me
shiver
with
the
things
she
can
never
say
anything
more
dreadful
to
me
than
she
has
said
already
not
go
if
you
like
if
you
were
i
am
sure
you
are
would
have
good
reason
to
be
satisfied
at
what
you
will
see
medically
speaking
it
is
a
sad
accordingly
that
every
afternoon
angela
accompanied
by
pigott
started
off
for
rewtham
house
where
lady
bellamy
still
lived
or
rather
existed
it
was
her
first
outing
since
the
inquest
on
george
caresfoot
had
caused
her
and
her
history
to
become
publicly
notorious
and
as
she
walked
along
she
was
surprised
to
find
that
she
was
the
object
of
popular
sympathy
every
man
she
met
touched
or
took
off
his
hat
according
to
his
degree
and
as
soon
as
she
had
passed
turned
round
and
stared
at
her
some
fine
folks
whom
she
did
not
indeed
she
knew
no
one
though
it
had
been
the
fashion
to
send
and
during
her
past
in
an
open
carriage
and
pair
and
she
saw
a
gentleman
on
the
front
seat
whisper
something
to
the
ladies
bringing
round
their
heads
towards
her
as
simultaneously
as
though
they
both
worked
on
a
single
wire
even
the
children
coming
out
of
the
village
school
set
up
a
cheer
as
she
passed
gracious
pigott
what
is
it
all
about
she
asked
at
last
you
see
miss
they
talk
of
you
in
the
papers
as
the
house
heroines
is
rare
in
these
overwhelmed
with
so
much
attention
angela
was
thankful
when
at
last
they
reached
rewtham
house
pigott
went
into
the
room
and
angela
was
at
once
shown
up
into
the
the
servant
announced
her
name
to
a
robed
figure
lying
on
a
sofa
and
closed
the
door
here
angela
caresfoot
said
a
voice
see
how
fate
has
repaid
the
woman
who
tried
to
ruin
she
advanced
and
looked
at
the
deathly
face
still
as
darkly
beautiful
as
ever
on
which
was
fixed
that
strange
look
of
wild
expectancy
that
it
had
worn
when
its
owner
took
the
poison
look
at
me
think
what
i
was
and
then
what
i
am
and
learn
how
the
spirit
of
evil
pays
those
who
serve
him
i
thought
to
kill
myself
but
death
was
denied
me
and
now
i
live
as
you
see
me
i
am
an
outcast
from
the
society
of
my
that
i
ever
cared
for
that
except
to
rule
it
i
can
not
stir
hand
or
foot
i
can
not
write
i
can
scarcely
read
i
can
not
even
die
my
only
resource
is
the
bitter
sea
of
thought
that
seethes
eternally
in
this
stricken
frame
like
fire
pent
in
the
womb
of
a
volcano
yes
angela
caresfoot
and
like
the
fire
too
sometimes
it
overflows
and
then
i
can
blaspheme
and
rave
aloud
till
my
voice
fails
that
is
the
only
power
which
is
left
to
angela
uttered
an
exclamation
of
pity
not
pity
me
i
will
not
be
pitied
by
you
mock
me
if
you
will
it
is
your
turn
now
you
prophesied
that
it
would
come
now
it
is
any
rate
you
are
still
comfortable
in
your
own
house
said
angela
nervously
anxious
to
change
the
subject
and
not
knowing
what
to
say
yes
i
have
money
enough
if
that
is
what
you
mean
my
husband
threatened
to
leave
me
destitute
but
fear
of
public
i
hear
that
he
has
run
away
and
is
not
well
thought
of
perhaps
of
myself
cripple
as
i
am
caused
him
to
change
his
mind
but
do
not
let
us
talk
of
that
poor
creature
i
sent
for
you
here
for
a
purpose
where
is
your
lover
angela
turned
pale
and
trembled
do
you
not
know
or
are
you
tired
of
him
of
him
i
shall
never
be
tired
of
him
but
he
has
i
tell
you
where
to
find
him
would
not
if
you
could
you
would
deceive
me
oddly
enough
i
shall
not
i
have
no
longer
any
object
in
doing
so
when
i
was
bent
upon
marrying
you
to
george
caresfoot
i
lashed
myself
into
hating
you
now
i
hate
you
no
longer
i
respect
indeed
i
have
done
so
all
why
did
you
work
me
such
a
bitter
wrong
i
was
forced
to
believe
me
or
not
as
you
will
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
the
any
rate
not
now
i
can
only
repeat
that
i
was
forced
is
arthur
madeira
do
you
remember
once
telling
me
that
you
had
only
to
lift
your
i
forgot
i
can
not
lift
draw
him
back
to
you
that
no
other
woman
in
the
world
could
keep
him
from
you
if
you
chose
to
bid
him
come
i
if
you
wish
to
get
him
back
you
had
better
exercise
your
power
for
he
has
gone
to
another
is
she
what
is
she
like
is
a
young
carr
she
is
desperately
in
love
with
beautiful
and
very
how
do
you
mean
tell
me
exactly
what
she
is
has
brown
eyes
brown
hair
a
lovely
complexion
and
a
perfect
angela
glanced
rapidly
at
her
own
reflection
in
the
glass
and
sighed
i
fear
that
i
shall
have
no
chance
against
are
a
fool
if
you
were
alone
in
the
same
room
with
her
nobody
would
see
her
for
looking
at
angela
sighed
again
this
time
from
relief
there
is
worse
than
that
very
possibly
he
has
married
then
it
is
all
over
if
he
loves
you
as
much
as
you
think
you
can
bring
him
back
to
you
married
or
yes
i
think
i
could
but
i
would
if
he
loves
you
and
you
love
him
you
have
a
right
to
him
among
all
the
shams
and
fictions
that
we
call
laws
there
is
only
one
the
law
of
nature
by
virtue
of
which
you
belong
to
each
there
is
a
higher
law
of
duty
by
means
of
which
we
try
to
curb
the
impulses
of
nature
the
woman
who
has
won
him
has
a
right
to
to
gratify
a
foolish
prejudice
you
are
prepared
to
lose
him
forever
lady
bellamy
if
i
thought
that
i
was
to
lose
him
for
ever
i
might
be
tempted
to
do
what
is
wrong
in
order
to
be
with
him
for
a
time
but
i
do
not
think
that
i
only
lose
him
for
a
time
that
i
may
gain
him
for
ever
in
this
world
he
is
separated
from
me
in
the
worlds
to
come
my
rights
will
assert
themselves
and
we
shall
be
together
and
never
part
any
lady
bellamy
looked
at
her
wonderingly
for
her
eyes
could
still
express
her
emotions
are
a
fine
creature
she
said
if
you
believe
that
perhaps
it
will
be
true
for
you
since
faith
must
be
the
measure
of
realization
but
after
all
he
may
not
have
married
her
that
will
be
for
you
to
find
can
i
find
out
writing
to
him
of
the
care
of
carr
madeira
that
is
sure
to
find
you
how
can
i
thank
you
enough
seems
to
me
that
you
owe
me
few
thanks
you
are
always
foolish
about
what
tends
to
secure
your
own
happiness
or
you
would
have
thought
of
this
there
was
a
pause
and
then
angela
rose
to
go
you
going
yes
go
i
am
not
fit
company
for
such
as
you
perhaps
we
shall
not
meet
again
but
in
thinking
of
all
the
injuries
that
i
have
done
you
remember
that
my
punishment
is
proportionate
to
my
sin
they
tell
me
that
i
may
live
for
angela
gazed
at
the
splendid
wreck
beneath
her
and
an
infinite
pity
swelled
in
her
gentle
heart
stooping
she
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
a
wild
astonishment
filled
lady
great
dark
eyes
child
what
are
you
doing
you
do
not
know
what
i
am
or
you
would
not
kiss
me
lady
bellamy
she
said
quietly
do
that
is
i
know
what
you
have
been
but
i
want
to
forget
that
perhaps
you
will
one
day
be
able
to
forget
it
too
i
do
not
wish
to
preach
but
perhaps
after
all
this
terrible
misfortune
may
lead
you
to
something
better
thank
god
there
is
forgiveness
for
us
her
words
touched
some
forgotten
chord
in
the
stricken
heart
and
two
big
tears
rolled
down
the
frozen
cheeks
they
were
the
first
anne
bellamy
had
wept
for
many
a
day
voice
she
said
a
music
that
awakes
the
echoes
from
a
time
when
i
was
good
and
pure
like
you
but
that
time
has
gone
for
lady
bellamy
the
heart
that
can
remember
it
can
also
strive
to
reach
another
like
it
if
you
have
descended
the
cliff
whence
those
echoes
spring
into
a
valley
however
deep
there
is
still
another
cliff
before
you
that
you
may
is
easy
to
descend
but
we
need
wings
to
climb
look
at
me
angela
my
body
is
not
more
crippled
and
shorn
of
power
than
my
dark
spirit
is
of
wings
how
can
climb
angela
bent
low
beside
her
and
whispered
a
few
words
in
her
ear
then
rose
with
a
shy
blush
upon
her
face
lady
bellamy
shut
her
eyes
presently
she
opened
them
again
not
speak
any
more
of
this
to
me
now
she
said
must
have
time
the
instinct
of
years
can
not
be
brushed
away
in
a
day
if
you
knew
all
the
sins
i
have
committed
perhaps
you
would
think
too
that
for
such
as
i
am
there
is
no
forgiveness
and
no
there
is
life
there
is
hope
and
as
i
once
heard
fraser
say
the
real
key
to
forgiveness
is
the
desire
to
be
again
lady
bellamy
shut
her
eyes
and
thought
and
when
she
drew
up
their
heavy
lids
angela
saw
that
there
was
something
of
a
peaceful
look
about
them
so
she
said
to
angela
where
the
light
falls
upon
your
face
that
will
do
now
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
read
there
on
your
forehead
sit
resolute
power
to
grasp
and
almost
measureless
capacity
to
imagine
in
your
eyes
there
is
a
sympathy
not
to
be
guessed
by
beings
of
a
coarser
fibre
those
eyes
could
look
at
heaven
and
not
be
dazzled
your
whole
face
speaks
of
a
purity
and
which
i
can
read
but
can
not
understand
your
mind
rejects
the
glittering
bubbles
that
men
follow
and
seeks
the
solid
truth
your
spirit
is
in
tune
with
things
of
light
and
air
it
can
float
to
the
extremest
heights
of
our
mental
atmosphere
and
thence
can
almost
gaze
into
the
infinite
beyond
pure
but
not
cold
thirsting
for
a
wider
knowledge
and
at
times
breathing
the
air
of
a
higher
world
resolute
but
patient
proud
and
yet
humble
to
learn
holy
but
aspiring
conscious
of
gifts
you
do
not
know
how
to
use
girl
you
rise
as
near
to
what
is
divine
as
a
mortal
may
i
have
always
thought
so
now
i
am
sure
of
bellamy
i
have
a
reason
for
what
i
say
i
do
not
ask
you
to
waste
time
by
listening
to
senseless
panegyrics
listen
i
will
tell
you
what
i
have
never
told
to
a
living
soul
before
for
years
i
have
been
a
student
of
a
lore
almost
forgotten
in
this
lore
which
once
fully
acquired
will
put
the
powers
that
lie
hid
in
nature
at
the
command
of
its
possessor
that
will
even
enable
him
to
look
beyond
nature
and
perhaps
so
far
as
the
duration
of
existence
is
concerned
for
awhile
to
triumph
over
it
that
lore
you
can
learn
though
it
baffled
me
my
intellect
and
determination
enabled
me
to
find
the
cues
to
it
and
to
stumble
on
some
of
its
secrets
but
i
could
not
follow
them
too
late
i
learnt
that
only
the
good
and
pure
can
do
that
much
of
the
result
of
years
of
toil
i
destroyed
the
other
night
but
i
still
know
enough
to
empower
you
to
reconstruct
what
i
annihilated
you
can
learn
more
in
one
year
than
i
learnt
in
ten
i
am
grateful
to
you
and
if
you
wish
it
i
will
show
you
the
angela
listened
lady
bellamy
was
right
she
was
greedy
of
knowledge
and
the
power
that
springs
from
knowledge
would
it
not
be
wrong
she
said
can
be
nothing
wrong
in
what
the
ruling
wisdom
allows
us
to
acquire
without
the
help
of
what
is
evil
but
do
not
be
deceived
such
knowledge
and
power
as
this
is
not
a
thing
to
be
trifled
with
to
obtain
a
mastery
over
it
you
must
devote
your
life
to
it
you
must
give
it
whole
not
strained
to
suit
desire
earthly
passion
must
come
to
trouble
the
fixed
serenity
of
your
aspirations
that
was
one
but
only
one
of
the
reasons
of
my
failure
you
must
leave
your
arthur
to
carr
and
henceforward
put
him
as
much
out
of
your
mind
as
possible
and
this
that
you
may
be
able
to
separate
yourself
from
earthly
bonds
and
hopes
and
fears
troubled
waters
reflect
a
broken
must
then
choose
between
this
knowledge
and
my
love
and
you
will
do
well
if
you
choose
the
knowledge
for
before
you
indeed
you
do
not
in
the
end
for
a
certain
period
overcome
even
will
be
more
of
an
angel
than
a
woman
on
the
one
hand
then
this
proud
and
dizzy
destiny
awaits
you
on
the
other
joys
and
sorrows
shared
by
all
the
world
and
an
ordinary
attachment
to
a
man
against
whom
i
have
indeed
nothing
to
say
but
who
is
not
your
equal
and
who
is
at
the
best
full
of
weaknesses
that
you
should
lady
bellamy
his
weaknesses
are
a
part
of
himself
and
i
love
him
all
just
as
he
is
weakness
needs
love
more
than
what
is
but
in
return
for
your
love
i
offer
you
no
empty
cup
i
do
not
ask
you
to
follow
fantastic
that
i
will
soon
convince
you
shall
i
show
you
the
semblance
of
your
arthur
and
carr
as
they
are
at
this
moment
lady
bellamy
no
i
have
chosen
you
offer
after
years
of
devotion
to
make
me
like
an
the
temptation
is
very
great
and
it
fascinates
me
but
i
hope
if
i
can
succeed
in
living
a
good
life
to
become
altogether
an
angel
when
i
die
why
then
should
i
attempt
to
filch
fragments
of
a
knowledge
that
will
one
day
be
all
my
own
indeed
it
is
right
to
do
so
whilst
i
am
here
love
is
more
to
me
than
such
knowledge
can
ever
be
if
he
is
married
i
may
learn
to
think
differently
and
try
to
soothe
my
mind
by
forcing
it
to
run
in
these
hidden
grooves
till
then
i
choose
arthur
and
my
petty
hopes
and
fears
for
after
all
they
are
the
natural
heritage
of
my
lady
bellamy
thought
for
awhile
and
answered
begin
to
think
that
the
great
power
who
made
us
has
mixed
even
his
most
perfect
works
with
an
element
of
weakness
lest
they
should
soar
too
high
and
see
too
far
the
prick
of
a
pin
will
bring
a
balloon
to
earth
and
an
earthly
passion
angela
will
prevent
you
from
soaring
to
the
clouds
so
be
it
you
have
had
your
chance
it
is
only
one
more
chapter
lxx
angela
went
home
very
thoughtful
the
next
three
days
she
spent
in
writing
first
she
wrote
a
clear
and
methodical
account
of
all
the
events
that
had
happened
since
first
departure
more
than
a
year
ago
and
attached
to
it
copies
of
the
various
documents
that
had
passed
between
herself
and
george
including
one
of
the
undertaking
that
her
husband
had
signed
before
the
marriage
this
account
was
in
the
form
of
a
statement
which
she
signed
and
taking
it
to
fraser
read
it
to
him
and
got
him
to
sign
it
too
it
took
her
two
whole
days
to
write
and
when
it
was
done
she
labelled
it
be
read
on
the
third
day
she
wrote
the
following
letter
to
go
with
the
statement
the
first
time
in
my
life
arthur
i
take
up
my
pen
to
write
to
you
and
in
truth
the
difficulty
of
the
task
before
me
as
well
as
my
own
want
of
skill
tends
to
bewilder
me
and
though
i
have
much
upon
my
mind
to
say
i
scarcely
know
if
it
will
reach
indeed
this
letter
is
ever
destined
to
lie
open
in
your
an
intelligible
form
statement
that
i
enclose
however
case
you
do
not
already
know
you
all
the
details
of
what
has
happened
since
you
left
me
more
than
a
year
ago
from
it
you
will
learn
how
cruelly
i
was
deceived
into
marrying
george
caresfoot
believing
you
dead
oh
through
all
eternity
never
shall
i
forget
that
fearful
night
nor
cease
to
thank
god
for
my
merciful
escape
from
the
fiend
whom
i
had
married
and
then
came
the
morning
and
brought
before
my
eyes
and
whilst
i
stood
in
the
first
tumult
of
my
forgetful
of
everything
but
that
it
was
you
my
own
my
beloved
arthur
no
spirit
but
you
in
flesh
and
i
yet
stood
thus
stricken
to
silence
by
the
shock
of
an
unutterable
broke
upon
me
with
those
dreadful
words
so
that
i
choked
feeling
how
just
they
must
seem
to
you
and
could
not
answer
yet
it
sometimes
fills
me
with
wonder
and
indignation
to
think
of
them
wonder
that
you
could
believe
me
so
mad
as
to
throw
away
the
love
of
my
life
and
indignation
that
you
could
deem
me
so
lost
as
to
dishonour
it
they
drove
me
mad
those
words
and
from
that
moment
forward
i
remember
nothing
but
a
chaos
of
the
mind
heaving
endlessly
like
the
sea
but
all
this
has
passed
and
i
am
thankful
to
say
that
i
am
quite
well
again
now
i
should
not
have
written
to
you
arthur
i
did
not
even
know
where
you
were
and
i
never
thought
of
recovering
you
after
what
has
passed
i
looked
upon
you
as
altogether
lost
to
me
for
this
world
but
a
few
days
ago
i
went
at
her
own
request
to
see
lady
bellamy
all
she
said
to
me
i
will
not
now
repeat
lest
i
should
render
this
letter
too
wearisome
to
read
though
a
great
deal
of
it
was
strange
enough
to
be
well
worth
repetition
in
the
upshot
however
she
said
that
i
had
better
write
to
you
and
told
me
where
to
write
and
so
i
write
to
you
dear
there
was
also
another
thing
that
she
told
me
of
sad
import
for
myself
but
which
i
must
not
shrink
to
face
she
said
that
there
lived
at
madeira
where
you
are
a
lady
who
is
in
love
with
you
and
is
herself
both
beautiful
and
wealthy
to
whom
you
would
have
gone
for
comfort
in
your
trouble
and
in
all
probability
have
married
arthur
i
do
not
know
if
this
is
the
case
but
if
so
i
hasten
to
say
that
i
do
not
blame
you
you
smarted
under
what
must
have
seemed
to
you
an
intolerable
wrong
and
you
went
for
consolation
to
her
who
had
it
to
offer
in
a
man
that
is
perhaps
natural
though
it
is
not
a
way
if
it
be
so
i
say
from
my
heart
be
as
happy
as
you
can
but
remember
what
i
told
you
long
ago
and
do
not
fall
into
any
delusions
on
the
matter
do
not
imagine
because
circumstances
have
shaped
themselves
thus
therefore
i
am
to
be
put
out
of
your
mind
and
forgotten
for
this
is
not
so
i
can
not
be
forgotten
though
for
a
while
i
may
be
justly
discarded
it
is
possible
that
for
this
world
you
have
passed
out
of
my
reach
but
in
the
next
i
shall
claim
you
as
my
own
arthur
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
lose
you
for
this
life
as
a
fitting
reward
for
my
folly
but
do
not
think
that
i
do
so
without
a
pang
for
believe
me
since
my
mind
emerged
stronger
and
clearer
from
the
storms
through
which
it
has
passed
bringing
back
to
me
the
full
life
and
strength
of
my
womanhood
i
have
longed
for
you
with
an
increasing
longing
i
am
not
ashamed
to
own
that
i
would
give
worlds
to
feel
your
arms
about
me
and
your
kiss
upon
my
lips
why
should
i
be
am
i
not
yours
body
and
soul
dear
it
has
been
given
to
me
perhaps
as
a
compensation
for
all
i
have
undergone
and
that
is
still
left
for
me
to
undergo
to
grasp
a
more
enduring
end
than
that
of
earthly
ecstasy
for
i
can
look
forward
with
a
confident
assurance
to
the
day
when
we
shall
embrace
upon
the
threshold
of
the
infinite
do
not
call
this
foolish
imagination
or
call
it
imagination
if
you
what
is
imagination
is
it
not
the
connecting
link
between
us
and
our
souls
and
recalling
memories
of
our
home
imagination
what
would
our
higher
life
be
without
it
it
is
what
the
mind
is
to
the
body
it
is
the
in
my
i
know
no
better
foresee
that
heavenly
hour
and
i
am
not
jealous
for
the
earthly
moment
nor
indeed
have
i
altogether
lost
you
for
at
times
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
when
the
earthly
part
is
plunged
in
sleep
and
my
spirit
is
released
from
the
thraldom
of
the
senses
it
at
indefinite
periods
has
the
power
to
summon
your
beloved
form
to
its
presence
and
in
this
communion
nature
vindicates
her
faithfulness
thus
through
the
long
night
rest
comes
upon
me
with
your
presence
at
last
there
will
come
a
greater
rest
at
lived
shall
die
alone
and
then
the
real
life
or
lives
will
begin
it
is
not
always
night
for
the
dawn
is
set
beyond
the
night
and
through
the
gates
of
dawn
we
shall
journey
to
the
day
it
is
not
always
night
even
in
the
womb
of
darkness
throbs
the
promise
of
the
morning
i
often
wonder
arthur
how
and
what
this
change
will
be
shall
we
be
even
as
we
are
but
still
through
unnumbered
ages
growing
slowly
on
to
the
divine
or
casting
off
the
very
semblance
of
mortality
shall
we
rise
at
one
wide
sweep
to
the
pinnacle
of
fulfilled
time
there
to
learn
the
purposes
and
mark
the
measure
of
all
being
can
i
know
but
this
i
believe
that
whatever
the
change
however
wide
and
deep
the
darkness
which
stretches
between
what
is
and
what
is
not
yet
we
can
not
lose
ourselves
therein
identity
will
still
be
ours
and
memory
the
will
still
pursue
us
calling
to
our
minds
the
enacted
evil
and
that
good
which
having
been
must
always
be
for
we
are
immortal
and
though
we
put
off
the
mortal
dress
though
our
forms
become
as
variable
as
the
clouds
and
assume
proportions
of
which
we
can
not
shall
memory
companion
us
and
identity
remain
for
we
are
each
fashioned
apart
for
ever
and
built
about
with
such
an
iron
wall
of
individual
life
that
all
the
force
of
time
and
change
can
not
so
much
as
shake
it
and
while
i
am
myself
and
yet
in
any
shape
endure
of
this
be
love
that
is
a
part
of
me
will
endure
also
oh
herein
is
set
my
not
my
hope
for
hope
upon
the
tongue
whispers
doubt
within
the
heart
but
the
most
fixed
unchanging
star
of
all
my
heaven
it
is
not
always
night
for
the
dawn
is
set
beyond
the
night
and
oh
my
beloved
at
daybreak
we
shall
meet
again
arthur
even
now
i
long
for
the
purer
air
and
flashing
sympathies
of
that
vast
hereafter
when
the
strong
sense
of
knowledge
shall
scarcely
find
a
limit
ere
it
overleaps
it
when
visible
power
shall
radiate
from
our
being
and
living
on
together
through
countless
existences
periods
and
spheres
we
shall
progress
from
majesty
to
majesty
oh
for
the
day
when
you
and
i
messengers
from
the
seat
of
power
shall
sail
high
above
these
darkling
worlds
and
seeing
into
each
souls
shall
learn
what
communion
is
not
think
me
foolish
dear
for
writing
to
you
thus
i
do
not
wish
to
make
you
the
victim
of
an
outburst
of
thought
that
you
may
think
hysterical
but
perhaps
i
may
never
be
able
to
write
to
you
again
in
this
way
your
wife
if
you
are
married
may
be
jealous
or
other
things
may
occur
to
prevent
it
i
feel
it
therefore
necessary
to
tell
you
my
inmost
thoughts
now
whilst
i
can
so
that
you
may
always
remember
them
during
the
long
coming
years
and
especially
when
you
draw
near
to
the
end
of
the
journey
i
hope
dearest
arthur
that
nothing
will
ever
make
you
forget
them
and
also
that
for
the
sake
of
the
pure
love
you
will
for
ever
bear
me
you
will
always
live
up
to
your
noblest
and
your
best
for
in
this
way
our
meeting
will
be
made
more
perfect
course
it
is
possible
that
you
may
still
be
free
and
after
you
know
that
i
am
not
quite
so
much
to
blame
as
you
may
have
thought
still
willing
to
give
your
name
to
me
it
is
a
blessed
hope
but
i
scarcely
dare
to
dwell
upon
it
other
day
i
was
reading
a
book
fraser
lent
me
which
took
my
fancy
very
much
it
was
so
full
of
contradictions
the
unexpected
always
happened
in
it
and
there
was
both
grief
and
laughter
in
its
pages
it
did
not
end
quite
well
or
quite
badly
or
rather
it
had
end
and
deep
down
underneath
the
plotless
story
only
peeping
up
now
and
again
when
the
actors
were
troubled
there
ran
a
vein
of
real
sorrow
and
sad
unchanging
love
there
was
a
hero
in
this
odd
book
which
was
so
like
by
the
way
was
no
hero
at
all
but
a
curious
restless
creature
who
seemed
to
have
missed
his
mark
in
life
and
went
along
looking
for
old
truths
and
new
ideas
with
his
eyes
so
fixed
upon
the
stars
that
he
was
always
stumbling
over
the
pebbles
in
his
path
and
thinking
that
they
were
rocks
he
was
a
sensitive
man
too
and
as
weak
as
he
was
sensitive
and
often
fell
into
pitfalls
and
did
what
he
should
not
and
yet
for
all
that
he
had
a
quaint
and
gentle
mind
and
there
was
something
to
like
in
least
so
thought
the
women
in
that
book
there
was
a
heroine
too
who
was
all
that
a
heroine
should
be
very
sweet
and
very
beautiful
and
she
really
had
a
heart
only
she
would
not
let
it
beat
and
of
course
the
hero
and
heroine
loved
each
other
of
course
too
they
both
behaved
badly
and
things
went
wrong
or
there
would
have
been
no
book
i
tell
you
this
story
because
once
in
a
rather
touching
scene
this
hero
who
made
such
a
mess
of
things
set
forth
one
of
the
ideas
that
he
had
found
and
thought
new
but
which
was
really
so
very
old
he
told
the
heroine
that
he
had
read
in
the
stars
that
happiness
has
only
one
key
and
that
its
name
is
that
amidst
all
the
mutabilities
and
disillusions
of
our
life
the
pure
love
of
a
man
and
woman
alone
stands
firm
and
beautiful
alone
defies
change
and
disappointment
that
it
is
the
salve
for
all
our
troubles
the
remedy
for
our
mistakes
the
magic
glass
reflecting
only
what
is
true
and
good
but
in
the
end
her
facts
overcame
his
theories
and
he
might
have
spared
himself
the
trouble
of
telling
and
for
all
his
this
hero
had
no
real
philosophy
but
in
his
grief
and
unresting
pain
went
and
threw
himself
into
the
biggest
pitfalls
that
he
could
find
and
would
have
perished
there
had
not
a
good
angel
come
and
dragged
him
out
again
and
brushed
the
mud
off
his
clothes
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
led
him
along
a
safer
path
and
so
for
awhile
he
drops
out
of
the
story
which
says
that
when
he
is
not
thinking
of
the
lost
heroine
he
is
perhaps
happier
than
he
deserves
to
be
arthur
i
think
that
this
foolish
hero
was
right
and
the
sensible
heroine
he
worshipped
so
blindly
wrong
you
are
still
unmarried
and
still
care
to
put
his
theories
to
the
test
i
believe
that
we
also
can
make
as
beautiful
a
thing
of
our
lives
as
he
thought
that
he
and
his
heroine
could
and
ourselves
supremely
happy
in
each
perfect
love
may
perhaps
be
able
to
add
to
the
happiness
of
some
of
our
that
is
i
think
as
noble
an
end
as
a
a
man
and
woman
can
set
before
themselves
if
on
the
other
hand
you
are
tied
to
this
other
woman
who
loves
you
by
ties
that
can
not
be
broken
or
that
honour
will
not
let
you
break
or
if
you
are
unforgiving
and
no
longer
wish
to
marry
me
as
i
wish
to
marry
you
then
till
that
bright
hour
of
immortal
farewell
yes
arthur
farewell
till
the
gate
of
time
has
closed
for
in
the
presence
of
god
our
father
i
shall
for
ever
call
you
mine
i
am
so
weak
that
my
tears
fall
as
i
write
the
word
perhaps
i
may
never
speak
or
write
to
you
again
so
once
more
my
dearest
my
beloved
my
earthly
treasure
and
my
heavenly
hope
farewell
may
the
blessing
of
god
be
as
constantly
around
you
as
my
thoughts
and
may
he
teach
you
that
these
are
not
foolish
words
but
rather
the
faint
shadow
of
an
undying
light
send
back
the
ring
that
was
used
to
trick
me
with
perhaps
whatever
happens
you
will
wear
it
for
my
sake
it
is
you
know
a
symbol
of
eternity
chapter
lxxi
just
as
angela
was
engaged
in
finishing
her
long
letter
to
surely
one
of
the
strangest
ever
written
by
a
girl
to
the
man
she
fraser
was
reading
an
epistle
which
had
reached
him
by
that
post
we
will
look
over
his
shoulder
and
see
what
was
in
it
it
was
a
letter
dated
from
the
vicarage
of
one
of
the
poorest
parishes
in
the
great
dock
district
in
the
east
of
london
it
sir
shall
be
only
too
thankful
to
entertain
your
proposal
for
an
exchange
of
livings
more
especially
as
at
first
sight
it
would
seem
that
all
the
advantage
is
on
my
side
the
fact
is
that
the
incessant
strain
of
work
here
has
at
last
broken
down
my
health
to
such
a
degree
that
the
doctors
tell
me
plainly
i
must
choose
between
the
comparative
rest
of
a
country
parish
or
the
certainty
of
passing
to
a
completer
quiet
before
my
time
also
now
that
my
children
are
growing
up
i
am
very
anxious
to
remove
them
from
the
sights
and
sounds
and
tainted
moral
atmosphere
of
this
stricken
and
degraded
quarter
however
that
may
be
i
should
not
be
doing
my
duty
to
you
if
i
did
not
warn
you
that
this
is
no
parish
for
a
man
of
your
age
to
undertake
unless
for
strong
reasons
for
i
see
by
the
clergy
list
that
you
are
a
year
or
so
older
than
myself
the
work
is
positively
ceaseless
and
often
of
a
most
shocking
and
thankless
character
and
there
are
almost
no
respectable
inhabitants
for
nobody
lives
in
the
parish
except
those
who
are
too
poor
to
live
elsewhere
the
stipend
too
is
as
you
are
aware
not
large
however
if
in
face
of
these
disadvantages
you
still
entertain
the
idea
of
an
exchange
perhaps
we
had
better
meet
the
letter
then
entered
into
details
think
that
will
suit
me
very
well
said
fraser
aloud
to
himself
as
he
put
it
down
will
not
greatly
matter
if
my
health
does
break
down
and
i
ought
to
have
gone
long
ago
ceaseless
he
says
the
work
is
well
ceaseless
work
is
the
only
thing
that
can
stifle
thought
and
yet
it
will
be
hard
coming
up
by
the
roots
after
all
these
years
ah
me
this
is
a
queer
world
and
a
sad
one
for
some
of
us
i
will
write
to
the
bishop
at
from
which
it
will
be
gathered
that
things
had
not
been
going
well
with
fraser
meanwhile
angela
put
her
statement
and
the
accompanying
letter
into
a
large
envelope
then
she
took
the
queer
emerald
ring
off
her
finger
and
as
there
was
nobody
looking
she
kissed
it
and
wrapped
it
up
in
a
piece
of
and
stowed
it
away
in
the
letter
and
sealed
it
up
next
she
addressed
it
in
her
clear
miniature
handwriting
to
heigham
of
carr
as
lady
bellamy
had
told
her
and
calling
to
pigott
to
come
with
her
started
off
to
the
to
register
and
post
her
precious
packet
for
the
madeira
mail
left
southampton
on
the
morrow
she
had
just
time
to
reach
the
office
affix
the
three
worth
of
stamps
that
the
letter
took
and
register
it
when
the
postman
came
up
and
she
saw
it
stamped
and
bundled
into
his
bag
with
the
others
just
as
though
it
were
nothing
instead
of
her
whole
life
depending
on
it
and
away
it
went
on
its
journey
as
much
beyond
recall
as
sins
so
you
have
been
to
him
miss
said
pigott
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
the
office
pigott
and
she
told
her
what
lady
bellamy
had
said
she
listened
attentively
with
a
shrewd
twinkle
in
her
eyes
thinking
dearie
that
a
pity
you
post
yourself
the
best
letter
it
make
no
mistakes
nor
fall
into
the
hands
of
them
it
meant
can
you
mean
thinking
miss
that
change
of
air
is
a
wonderful
good
thing
after
sickness
especially
answered
pigott
oracularly
in
the
least
understand
you
really
pigott
you
drive
me
wild
with
your
dear
for
all
so
clever
you
never
could
see
half
an
inch
into
a
brick
wall
and
that
with
my
meaning
as
clear
as
a
haystick
in
a
this
last
definition
quite
finished
angela
why
she
wondered
should
a
haystack
be
clearer
in
a
thunderstorm
than
at
any
other
time
she
looked
at
her
companion
helplessly
and
was
silent
me
what
i
have
been
telling
as
plain
as
plain
can
be
is
why
you
go
to
this
the
name
never
can
think
of
them
foreign
names
like
jakes
and
the
flowers
he
says
the
smaller
and
they
are
the
longer
the
name
they
sticks
on
to
them
just
to
puzzle
a
body
suggested
angela
with
the
calmness
of
despair
well
why
you
go
to
madeiry
along
with
your
letter
to
look
after
arthur
like
enough
he
is
in
a
bit
of
a
mess
there
so
far
as
i
know
anything
about
their
ways
young
men
always
are
in
a
general
sort
of
way
for
everlasting
after
some
one
or
other
for
all
the
world
like
a
tom
on
the
tiles
more
especial
if
they
are
in
love
with
somebody
else
but
dear
me
a
sensible
woman
bother
her
head
about
that
she
just
goes
and
hooks
them
out
of
it
and
then
she
knows
where
they
are
and
keeps
them
pigott
never
mind
all
these
reflections
though
sure
i
know
how
you
can
think
of
such
things
the
idea
of
comparing
poor
dear
arthur
with
a
but
tell
me
how
can
i
go
to
madeira
supposing
that
he
is
married
then
you
would
learn
all
about
it
for
yourself
and
no
gammoning
and
be
an
end
to
it
one
way
or
the
would
it
be
quite
modest
to
run
after
him
like
that
indeed
and
why
a
young
lady
travel
for
her
health
i
have
heard
say
that
this
madeiry
is
a
wonderful
place
for
the
lungs
then
the
lungs
but
it
matter
they
far
off
each
pigott
who
could
i
go
with
i
could
not
go
with
why
me
of
can
hardly
fancy
you
at
sea
why
not
miss
i
dare
say
i
shall
do
as
well
as
other
folks
there
and
if
i
do
go
to
the
bottom
as
seems
likely
plenty
of
room
for
a
respectable
person
there
i
should
hope
look
here
dear
never
be
happy
unless
you
marry
arthur
so
you
go
and
throw
away
a
chance
just
out
of
foolishness
and
for
fear
of
what
folks
say
how
dozens
of
women
make
a
mess
of
it
folks
say
one
thing
and
another
but
remain
you
for
all
that
maybe
married
and
if
so
a
bad
business
and
an
end
of
it
but
maybe
too
he
as
for
that
letter
as
likely
as
not
the
other
one
will
put
it
in
the
fire
i
should
i
doubt
if
i
were
in
her
shoes
so
you
lose
any
time
for
if
he
married
like
enough
he
soon
will
angela
felt
that
there
was
sense
in
what
her
old
nurse
said
though
the
idea
was
a
new
one
to
her
and
it
made
her
thoughtful
think
about
it
she
said
presently
wonder
what
fraser
would
say
about
one
thing
and
perhaps
another
good
and
kind
but
he
got
much
head
for
these
sort
of
things
always
thinking
of
something
else
just
look
what
a
fool
squire
george
may
he
twist
and
turn
in
his
grave
made
of
him
you
ask
him
if
you
like
but
you
be
guided
by
yourself
dearie
your
head
is
worth
six
reverend
when
you
bring
it
to
a
thing
but
i
must
be
off
and
count
the
that
evening
after
tea
angela
went
down
to
he
was
directing
an
envelope
to
the
lord
bishop
of
his
diocese
when
she
entered
but
he
hurriedly
put
it
away
in
the
angela
did
you
get
your
letter
off
fraser
it
was
just
in
time
to
catch
the
mail
but
do
you
know
that
is
what
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
pigott
thinks
that
under
all
the
angela
hesitated
a
and
i
had
better
go
to
madeira
and
find
out
how
things
stand
and
i
almost
think
that
she
is
answered
fraser
rising
and
looking
out
of
the
window
have
a
great
deal
at
do
not
think
that
it
would
be
immodest
dear
angela
when
in
such
a
case
as
this
a
woman
goes
to
seek
the
man
she
loves
and
whom
she
believes
loves
her
i
do
not
myself
see
where
there
is
room
for
nor
do
i
and
i
do
love
him
so
very
dearly
he
is
all
my
life
to
fraser
winced
visibly
is
the
matter
have
you
got
a
headache
only
a
twinge
here
and
he
pointed
to
his
heart
angela
looked
alarmed
she
took
a
womanly
interest
in
ailments
know
what
it
is
she
said
james
suffers
from
it
you
must
take
it
in
hand
at
once
or
it
will
become
chronic
after
meals
as
hers
fraser
smiled
grimly
as
he
answered
am
afraid
that
i
have
neglected
it
too
has
become
chronic
already
but
about
madeira
have
you
then
made
up
your
mind
to
go
i
think
that
i
shall
go
if
married
you
can
always
come
back
again
and
perhaps
pigott
is
right
the
letter
might
miscarry
and
there
is
so
much
at
shall
you
go
then
the
next
steamer
i
suppose
they
go
every
week
i
think
i
will
tell
my
father
that
i
am
going
you
will
want
money
i
i
believe
that
i
have
plenty
of
money
of
my
own
yes
under
your
marriage
settlement
no
doubt
well
my
dear
i
am
sure
i
hope
that
your
journey
will
not
be
in
vain
did
i
tell
you
i
have
also
written
to
heigham
by
this
mail
and
told
him
all
i
knew
about
the
matter
is
very
kind
and
thoughtful
of
you
it
is
just
like
you
answered
angela
gently
at
all
not
at
all
but
you
have
never
told
me
how
you
got
on
with
lady
is
except
what
she
told
you
about
it
was
a
strange
interview
what
do
you
think
she
wanted
to
teach
me
have
not
the
faintest
she
did
she
told
me
that
she
could
read
all
sorts
of
things
in
my
face
and
offered
if
i
would
give
myself
up
to
it
to
make
me
more
than
it
was
a
bit
of
charlatanism
she
wanted
to
frighten
i
think
she
believed
what
she
said
and
i
think
that
she
has
some
sort
of
power
she
seemed
disappointed
when
i
refused
and
do
you
know
it
if
it
had
not
been
for
arthur
i
do
not
think
that
i
should
have
refused
i
love
power
or
rather
knowledge
but
then
i
love
arthur
why
is
he
incompatible
with
knowledge
do
not
know
but
she
said
that
to
triumph
over
the
mysteries
she
wished
to
teach
me
i
must
free
myself
from
earthly
love
and
cares
i
told
her
that
if
arthur
is
married
i
would
think
of
angela
to
be
frank
i
do
not
believe
in
lady
magic
and
if
its
practice
brings
people
to
what
she
is
i
think
it
is
best
left
alone
indeed
i
expect
that
the
whole
thing
is
a
delusion
arising
from
her
condition
but
i
think
she
is
right
when
she
told
you
that
to
become
a
mistress
of
her
indeed
of
any
noble
you
must
separate
yourself
from
earthly
passions
i
owe
your
arthur
a
grudge
as
well
as
lady
bellamy
i
hoped
angela
to
see
you
rise
like
a
star
upon
this
age
of
insolence
and
infidelity
i
wanted
you
to
be
a
great
woman
but
that
dream
is
all
over
fraser
my
dear
both
history
and
observation
teach
us
that
great
gifts
like
yours
partake
of
the
character
of
an
accident
in
a
woman
they
are
not
natural
to
her
and
she
does
not
wear
such
jewels
easily
put
her
outside
of
her
sex
it
is
something
as
though
a
man
were
born
into
the
world
with
wings
at
first
he
would
be
very
proud
of
them
and
go
sailing
about
in
the
sky
to
the
admiration
of
the
crowds
beneath
him
but
he
would
grow
tired
of
flying
alone
and
after
all
it
is
not
necessary
to
fly
to
transact
the
ordinary
business
of
the
world
and
perhaps
at
last
he
would
learn
to
love
somebody
without
wings
somebody
who
could
not
fly
and
he
would
always
want
to
be
with
her
down
on
the
homely
earth
and
not
alone
up
in
the
heavenly
heights
if
a
woman
had
all
the
genius
of
plato
or
all
the
learning
of
solomon
it
would
be
forgotten
at
the
touch
of
a
fingers
well
we
can
not
fight
against
human
nature
and
i
daresay
that
in
a
few
years
you
will
forget
that
you
can
read
greek
as
well
as
you
can
english
and
were
very
near
finding
out
a
perfect
way
of
squaring
the
circle
perhaps
it
is
best
so
lady
bellamy
may
have
read
a
great
many
fine
things
in
your
face
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
read
there
i
read
that
you
will
marry
your
arthur
and
become
a
happy
wife
and
a
happier
mother
that
your
life
will
be
one
long
story
of
unassuming
kindness
and
that
when
at
last
you
die
you
will
become
a
sacred
memory
in
many
hearts
that
is
what
i
read
the
only
magic
you
will
ever
wield
angela
will
be
the
magic
of
your
knows
we
can
not
read
the
future
she
answered
so
you
are
going
to
madeira
next
week
then
this
will
be
the
last
time
that
we
shall
you
go
i
i
am
off
to
london
for
a
while
on
some
business
when
next
we
meet
if
we
do
meet
again
angela
you
will
be
a
married
woman
do
not
start
dear
there
is
nothing
shocking
about
that
but
perhaps
we
shall
not
meet
any
fraser
why
do
you
say
such
dreadful
things
is
nothing
dreadful
about
it
angela
i
am
getting
on
in
life
and
am
not
so
strong
as
i
was
and
you
are
both
young
and
strong
and
must
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
outlive
me
for
many
years
but
whatever
happens
my
dear
i
know
that
you
always
keep
a
warm
corner
in
your
memory
for
your
old
master
and
as
for
me
i
can
honestly
say
that
to
have
known
and
taught
you
has
been
the
greatest
privilege
of
a
rather
lonely
here
angela
began
to
cry
cry
my
dear
there
is
thank
god
another
than
this
and
if
i
reach
the
shore
of
that
great
future
before
you
i
there
my
dear
it
is
time
for
you
to
be
going
home
you
must
not
stop
here
to
listen
to
this
melancholy
talk
go
home
angela
and
think
about
your
lover
i
am
busy
give
me
a
kiss
dear
and
presently
she
was
gone
and
he
heard
the
close
behind
her
he
went
to
the
window
and
watched
the
tall
form
gradually
growing
fainter
in
the
gloaming
till
it
vanished
altogether
then
he
came
back
and
sitting
down
at
his
rested
his
grizzled
head
upon
his
hand
and
thought
presently
he
raised
it
and
there
was
a
sad
smile
flickering
round
the
wrinkles
of
the
nervous
mouth
now
for
labour
at
the
london
docks
he
said
aloud
chapter
lxxii
nothing
occurred
to
mar
the
prosperity
of
the
voyage
of
the
that
beautiful
little
vessel
declined
to
simplify
the
course
of
this
history
by
going
to
the
bottom
with
mildred
and
arthur
as
the
imaginative
reader
may
have
perhaps
expected
she
did
not
even
get
into
a
terrific
storm
in
order
to
give
arthur
the
opportunity
of
performing
heroic
feats
and
the
writer
of
this
history
the
chance
of
displaying
a
profound
knowledge
of
the
names
of
ropes
and
spars
on
the
contrary
she
glided
on
upon
a
sea
so
still
that
even
miss
terry
was
persuaded
to
arouse
herself
from
her
torpor
and
come
upon
deck
till
at
last
one
morning
the
giant
peak
of
teneriffe
soaring
high
above
its
circling
clouds
broke
upon
the
view
of
her
passengers
here
they
stopped
for
a
week
or
so
enjoying
themselves
very
much
in
their
new
surroundings
till
at
length
arthur
grew
tired
of
the
islands
which
was
of
course
the
signal
for
their
departure
so
they
returned
reaching
madeira
after
an
absence
of
close
upon
a
month
as
they
dropped
anchor
in
the
little
bay
mildred
came
up
to
arthur
and
touching
him
with
that
gentle
deference
which
she
always
showed
towards
him
asked
him
if
he
was
not
glad
to
be
home
again
he
said
have
no
arthur
she
answered
do
you
try
to
pain
me
is
not
my
home
yours
also
so
soon
as
they
landed
he
started
off
to
hotel
to
see
if
any
letters
had
come
for
him
during
his
absence
and
returned
looking
very
much
put
out
is
the
matter
arthur
asked
miss
terry
once
again
happy
at
feeling
her
feet
upon
solid
soil
those
idiots
at
the
hotel
have
returned
a
letter
sent
to
me
by
my
lawyer
they
thought
that
i
had
left
madeira
for
good
and
the
letter
was
marked
left
return
to
borley
and
son
with
the
address
and
the
mail
went
out
this
afternoon
into
the
bargain
so
it
will
be
a
month
before
i
can
get
it
back
had
arthur
known
that
this
letter
contained
clippings
of
the
newspaper
reports
of
the
inquest
on
george
caresfoot
of
whose
death
even
he
was
in
total
ignorance
he
would
have
had
good
reason
to
be
put
out
mind
arthur
said
clear
voice
at
his
was
rarely
much
further
from
him
than
his
shadow
letters
are
not
as
a
rule
very
interesting
i
never
yet
had
one
that
would
not
keep
come
and
see
if
your
that
a
grand
name
arranged
to
your
liking
and
then
let
us
go
to
dinner
for
agatha
here
is
dying
of
has
to
make
up
for
her
abstinence
at
was
always
told
broke
in
that
lady
yachting
was
charming
but
i
tell
you
frankly
i
have
never
been
more
miserable
in
my
life
than
i
was
on
board
your
mind
dear
you
shall
have
a
nice
long
rest
before
we
start
for
the
coast
of
and
so
arthur
soon
settled
down
again
into
the
easy
tenor
of
madeira
life
he
now
scarcely
made
a
pretence
of
living
at
the
hotel
since
during
their
cruise
mildred
had
had
a
pavilion
which
stood
in
the
garden
luxuriously
set
up
for
his
occupation
here
he
was
happy
enough
in
a
dull
numb
way
and
as
the
days
went
on
something
of
the
old
light
came
back
to
his
eyes
and
his
footfall
again
grew
quick
and
strong
as
when
it
used
to
fall
in
the
corridors
of
the
abbey
house
of
the
past
he
never
spoke
nor
did
mildred
ever
allude
to
angela
after
that
conversation
at
sea
which
had
ended
so
strangely
she
contented
herself
with
attempting
to
supplant
her
and
to
a
certain
extent
she
was
successful
no
man
could
have
for
very
long
remained
obdurate
to
such
beauty
and
such
patient
devotion
and
it
is
not
wonderful
that
he
grew
in
a
way
to
love
her
but
there
was
this
peculiarity
about
the
that
the
affection
which
he
bore
her
was
born
more
of
her
stronger
will
than
of
his
own
feelings
as
was
shown
by
the
fact
that
so
long
as
he
was
actually
with
her
and
within
the
circle
of
her
influence
her
power
over
him
was
predominant
but
the
moment
that
he
was
out
of
her
sight
his
thoughts
would
fall
back
into
their
original
channels
and
the
old
sores
would
begin
to
run
however
much
too
he
might
be
successful
in
getting
the
mastery
of
his
troubles
by
day
at
night
they
would
assert
themselves
and
from
the
constant
and
tormenting
dreams
which
they
inspired
he
could
find
no
means
of
escape
for
at
least
four
nights
out
of
every
seven
from
the
moment
that
he
closed
his
eyes
till
he
opened
them
again
in
the
morning
it
would
seem
to
him
that
he
had
been
in
the
company
of
angela
under
every
possible
variety
of
circumstance
talking
to
her
walking
with
her
meeting
her
suddenly
or
unexpectedly
in
crowded
places
or
at
always
her
and
no
one
at
last
poor
arthur
began
to
wonder
if
his
spirit
took
leave
of
his
body
in
sleep
and
went
to
seek
her
and
what
is
more
found
her
or
was
it
nothing
but
a
fantasy
he
could
not
tell
but
at
any
rate
it
was
a
fact
and
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
if
it
distressed
or
rejoiced
him
most
occasionally
too
he
would
fall
into
a
fit
of
brooding
melancholy
that
would
last
him
for
a
day
or
two
and
which
mildred
would
find
it
quite
impossible
to
dispel
indeed
when
he
got
in
that
way
she
soon
discovered
that
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
leave
him
alone
he
was
suffering
acutely
there
was
no
doubt
about
that
and
when
any
animal
suffers
including
man
it
is
best
left
in
solitude
a
sick
or
wounded
beast
always
turns
out
of
the
herd
to
recover
or
die
when
mildred
saw
him
in
this
state
of
mental
desolation
she
would
shake
her
head
and
sigh
for
it
told
her
that
she
was
as
far
as
ever
from
the
golden
gate
of
her
eldorado
as
has
been
said
hers
was
the
strongest
will
and
even
if
he
had
not
willed
it
she
could
have
married
him
any
day
she
wished
but
odd
as
it
may
seem
she
was
too
conscientious
she
had
determined
that
she
would
not
marry
him
unless
she
was
certain
that
he
loved
her
and
to
this
resolution
as
yet
she
firmly
held
whatever
her
faults
may
have
been
mildred
carr
had
all
the
noble
unselfishness
that
is
so
common
in
her
sex
for
herself
and
her
own
reputation
she
cared
comparatively
speaking
nothing
whilst
for
ultimate
happiness
she
was
very
solicitous
one
was
one
of
black
days
when
he
had
got
a
fit
of
what
mildred
called
were
walking
together
in
the
garden
arthur
in
silence
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
mildred
humming
a
little
tune
by
way
of
amusing
herself
when
they
came
to
the
wall
that
edged
the
precipice
arthur
leant
over
it
and
gazed
at
the
depths
below
dear
you
will
tumble
over
said
mildred
in
some
alarm
think
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
i
did
he
answered
moodily
you
then
so
tired
of
the
me
dear
i
am
not
tired
of
you
forgive
me
mildred
but
i
am
dreadfully
miserable
i
know
that
it
is
very
ungracious
and
ungrateful
of
me
but
it
is
the
are
thinking
of
again
arthur
i
have
got
a
fit
of
it
i
suppose
that
she
has
not
been
out
of
my
mind
for
an
hour
altogether
during
the
last
hours
talk
of
being
haunted
by
a
dead
person
it
is
infinitely
worse
being
haunted
by
a
living
am
very
sorry
for
you
you
suppose
mildred
that
this
will
go
on
for
all
my
life
that
i
shall
always
be
at
the
mercy
of
these
bitter
memories
and
thoughts
know
arthur
i
hope
wish
i
were
wish
i
were
dead
he
broke
out
passionately
has
destroyed
my
life
all
that
was
happy
in
me
is
dead
only
my
body
lives
on
i
am
sure
i
know
mildred
how
you
can
care
for
anything
so
she
kissed
him
and
answered
i
had
rather
love
you
as
you
are
than
any
other
man
alive
time
does
wonders
perhaps
in
time
you
will
get
over
it
oh
arthur
when
i
think
of
what
she
has
made
you
and
what
you
might
have
been
if
you
had
never
known
her
i
long
to
tell
that
woman
all
my
mind
but
you
must
be
a
man
dear
it
is
weak
to
give
way
to
a
mad
passion
such
as
this
is
now
try
to
think
of
something
else
work
at
have
no
heart
for
it
mildred
i
feel
as
though
i
could
work
and
if
you
can
not
make
me
forget
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
what
mildred
sighed
and
did
not
answer
though
she
spoke
hopefully
about
it
to
him
she
had
little
faith
in
his
getting
over
his
passion
for
angela
now
either
she
must
marry
him
as
he
was
or
else
let
him
go
altogether
but
which
the
struggle
between
her
affection
and
her
idea
of
duty
was
very
sore
and
as
yet
she
could
come
to
no
conclusion
one
thing
there
was
that
troubled
her
considerably
and
this
was
that
though
madeira
was
almost
empty
there
were
enough
people
in
it
to
get
up
a
good
deal
of
gossip
about
herself
and
arthur
now
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
anybody
more
entirely
careless
of
the
judgments
of
society
than
mildred
more
especially
as
her
great
wealth
and
general
popularity
protected
her
from
slights
but
for
all
her
oddities
she
was
a
thorough
woman
of
the
world
and
she
knew
none
better
that
in
pursuance
of
an
almost
invariable
natural
law
there
is
nothing
that
lowers
a
woman
so
much
in
the
estimation
of
a
man
as
the
knowledge
that
she
is
talked
about
even
though
he
himself
is
the
cause
of
the
talk
this
may
be
both
illogical
and
unjust
but
it
is
none
the
less
true
but
if
mildred
still
hesitated
arthur
did
not
he
was
very
anxious
that
they
should
be
married
indeed
he
almost
insisted
on
it
the
position
was
one
that
was
far
from
being
agreeable
to
him
for
all
such
intimacies
must
from
their
very
nature
necessitate
a
certain
amount
of
false
swearing
they
are
throughout
an
acted
lie
and
when
the
lie
is
acted
it
must
sometimes
be
spoken
now
this
is
a
state
of
affairs
that
is
repugnant
to
an
honourable
man
and
one
that
not
unfrequently
becomes
perfectly
intolerable
many
is
the
that
comes
to
a
sudden
end
because
the
man
finds
it
impossible
to
permanently
constitute
himself
a
peregrinating
falsehood
but
oddly
enough
it
has
been
found
difficult
to
persuade
the
other
contracting
party
of
the
validity
of
the
excuse
and
however
unjust
it
may
be
one
has
known
of
men
who
have
seen
their
defection
energetically
set
down
to
more
vulgar
causes
arthur
was
no
exception
to
this
rule
he
found
himself
in
a
false
position
and
he
hated
it
indeed
he
determined
before
long
he
would
place
it
before
mildred
in
the
light
of
an
alternative
that
he
should
either
marry
her
or
that
an
end
should
be
put
to
their
existing
relations
chapter
lxxiii
as
the
autumn
came
on
a
great
gale
burst
over
madeira
and
went
sweeping
away
up
the
bay
of
biscay
it
blew
for
three
days
and
nights
and
was
one
of
the
heaviest
on
record
when
it
first
began
the
english
mail
was
due
but
when
it
passed
there
were
still
no
signs
of
her
and
prophets
of
evil
were
not
wanting
who
went
to
and
fro
shaking
their
heads
and
suggesting
that
she
had
probably
foundered
in
the
bay
two
more
days
went
by
and
there
were
still
no
signs
of
her
though
the
telegraph
told
them
that
she
had
left
southampton
docks
at
the
appointed
time
and
date
by
this
time
people
in
madeira
could
talk
of
nothing
else
arthur
no
signs
of
the
said
mildred
on
the
fifth
day
the
is
due
in
perhaps
she
may
have
heard
something
of
said
miss
terry
absently
may
have
fallen
in
with
some
of
the
must
say
that
is
a
cheerful
suggestion
answered
arthur
is
an
awful
old
tub
and
i
daresay
ran
before
the
gale
for
vigo
that
is
us
hope
so
said
mildred
doubtfully
is
it
john
housemaid
wishes
to
speak
to
you
please
good
i
will
it
has
been
hinted
that
agatha
terry
was
looking
absent
on
the
morning
in
question
there
was
a
reason
for
it
for
some
time
past
there
had
been
growing
up
in
the
bosom
of
this
excellent
lady
a
consciousness
that
things
were
not
altogether
as
they
should
be
miss
terry
was
not
clever
indeed
it
may
be
said
that
she
was
dense
but
still
she
could
not
but
see
that
there
was
something
odd
in
the
relations
between
arthur
and
mildred
for
instance
it
struck
her
as
unusual
that
two
persons
who
were
not
married
nor
even
so
far
as
she
knew
engaged
should
habitually
call
each
other
and
even
sometimes
but
on
the
previous
evening
when
engaged
in
a
search
after
that
species
of
beetle
that
loves
the
night
she
chanced
to
come
across
the
pair
standing
together
on
the
museum
verandah
and
to
her
horror
she
saw
even
in
that
light
that
arm
was
round
neck
and
her
head
was
resting
on
his
heart
standing
aghast
she
saw
more
for
presently
mildred
raised
her
hand
and
drawing
head
down
to
the
level
of
her
own
kissed
him
upon
the
face
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
it
was
a
most
deliberate
kiss
without
any
extenuating
circumstances
he
was
not
even
going
away
and
agatha
could
only
come
to
one
conclusion
that
they
were
either
going
to
be
ought
to
she
sought
no
more
beetles
that
evening
but
on
the
following
morning
when
mildred
departed
to
see
the
housemaid
leaving
arthur
and
herself
together
on
the
verandah
she
thought
it
was
her
to
seek
a
little
information
she
said
with
a
beating
heart
want
to
ask
you
something
are
you
engaged
to
mildred
he
hesitated
and
then
answered
i
suppose
not
miss
married
to
her
why
do
you
ask
i
think
you
ought
to
quite
agree
with
you
i
suppose
that
you
have
noticed
something
i
have
i
saw
her
kissing
you
he
blushed
like
a
girl
arthur
she
went
on
bursting
into
tears
let
this
sort
of
thing
go
on
or
poor
mildred
will
lose
her
reputation
and
you
must
know
what
a
dreadful
thing
that
is
for
any
woman
why
you
marry
her
she
refused
to
marry
yet
she
kisses
that
added
miss
terry
as
the
peculiar
fervour
of
the
embrace
in
question
came
back
to
her
recollection
i
know
what
to
not
think
about
it
at
all
miss
terry
it
bear
arthur
how
could
you
he
looked
very
uncomfortable
as
he
know
that
i
must
seem
a
dreadful
brute
to
you
i
daresay
i
am
but
miss
terry
it
would
under
all
the
circumstances
be
much
more
to
the
point
if
you
insisted
on
marrying
dare
not
you
do
not
know
mildred
she
would
never
submit
to
it
from
i
must
and
what
is
more
i
will
do
it
you
arthur
thank
you
i
can
not
tell
you
how
grateful
i
am
to
is
no
need
to
be
grateful
to
the
author
of
this
supposing
she
will
you
do
then
i
think
that
i
shall
go
away
at
once
hush
here
she
arthur
what
are
you
and
agatha
plotting
together
you
both
look
serious
is
only
another
mildred
glanced
at
him
uneasily
she
did
not
like
the
tone
in
his
voice
have
a
bit
of
bad
news
for
you
arthur
that
fool
that
idiot
she
stamped
her
little
foot
upon
the
upset
the
mummy
and
broken
the
flower
off
just
as
it
was
coming
into
bloom
i
have
given
her
a
wages
and
her
passage
back
to
england
and
packed
her
mildred
remonstrated
miss
terry
a
fuss
to
make
about
a
flower
she
turned
on
her
almost
fiercely
had
rather
have
broken
my
arm
or
anything
short
of
my
neck
than
that
she
should
have
broken
that
flower
arthur
planted
it
and
now
the
clumsy
girl
has
destroyed
it
and
mildred
looked
as
though
she
were
going
to
cry
as
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
miss
terry
went
away
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
mildred
turned
to
arthur
and
were
right
arthur
we
shall
never
see
it
bloom
in
this
mind
about
the
flower
dear
it
can
not
be
helped
i
want
to
speak
to
you
of
something
more
important
miss
terry
saw
you
kiss
me
last
night
and
she
not
unnaturally
is
anxious
to
know
what
it
all
did
you
tell
her
it
was
turn
to
blush
now
you
must
listen
to
me
this
can
not
go
on
any
more
either
you
must
marry
me
what
i
must
go
away
at
present
our
whole
life
is
a
you
really
wish
me
to
marry
you
arthur
not
only
wish
it
i
think
it
you
nothing
more
to
say
than
that
i
have
to
say
that
i
will
do
my
best
to
make
you
a
good
and
faithful
husband
and
that
i
am
sure
you
will
make
me
a
good
she
dropped
her
face
upon
her
hands
and
thought
just
then
miss
terry
came
hurrying
up
arthur
she
said
think
the
is
in
after
all
but
all
her
boats
are
gone
and
they
say
that
half
of
her
passengers
and
crew
are
washed
overboard
do
go
down
and
see
about
he
hesitated
a
little
dear
whispered
mildred
want
time
to
think
i
will
give
you
my
answer
this
mildred
sat
still
on
the
verandah
thinking
but
she
had
not
been
there
many
minutes
before
a
servant
came
with
her
english
letters
that
had
been
brought
by
the
unfortunate
and
at
the
same
time
informed
her
that
the
had
been
sighted
and
would
anchor
in
a
few
hours
mildred
reflected
that
it
was
not
often
they
got
two
english
mails
in
one
day
she
began
idly
turning
over
the
packet
before
her
of
late
letters
had
lost
much
of
their
interest
for
mildred
presently
however
her
hand
made
a
movement
of
almost
electric
swiftness
and
the
colour
left
her
face
as
she
seized
a
stout
envelope
directed
in
a
hand
of
peculiar
delicacy
to
heigham
care
of
carr
mildred
knew
the
handwriting
she
had
seen
it
in
it
was
angela
next
to
it
there
was
another
letter
addressed
to
arthur
in
a
hand
that
she
did
not
know
but
bearing
the
same
postmarks
and
she
put
them
both
aside
and
then
took
up
the
thick
letter
and
examined
it
it
had
two
it
was
open
having
come
unsealed
in
transit
and
been
somewhat
roughly
tied
up
with
a
piece
of
twine
and
secondly
it
contained
some
article
of
jewellery
indeed
by
dint
of
a
little
pressing
on
the
outside
paper
she
was
able
to
form
a
pretty
accurate
opinion
as
to
what
it
was
it
was
a
ring
if
she
had
turned
pale
before
when
she
saw
the
letter
she
was
paler
still
now
she
thought
does
she
send
him
a
ring
has
anything
happened
to
her
husband
if
she
is
a
free
woman
i
am
mildred
looked
at
the
letter
lying
open
before
her
and
a
terrible
temptation
took
possession
of
her
she
took
it
up
and
put
it
down
again
and
then
again
she
took
it
up
wiping
the
cold
perspiration
from
her
forehead
whole
life
is
at
stake
she
thought
then
she
hesitated
no
longer
but
taking
the
letter
slipped
off
the
piece
of
twine
and
drew
its
contents
from
the
envelope
the
first
thing
to
fall
out
wrapped
in
a
little
was
the
ring
she
looked
at
it
and
recognized
it
as
engagement
ring
the
same
that
lady
bellamy
had
taken
with
her
then
putting
aside
the
statement
she
deliberately
unfolded
the
letter
and
read
it
do
not
think
too
hardly
of
her
my
reader
the
temptation
was
very
sore
but
when
one
yields
to
temptation
retribution
is
not
unfrequently
hard
upon
its
track
and
it
would
only
have
been
necessary
to
watch
face
to
see
that
if
she
had
sinned
the
sin
went
hand
in
hand
with
punishment
in
turn
it
took
an
expression
of
astonishment
grief
awe
and
despair
she
read
the
letter
to
the
last
word
then
she
took
the
statement
and
glanced
through
it
smiling
once
or
twice
as
she
read
next
she
replaced
everything
in
the
envelope
and
taking
it
together
with
the
other
letter
addressed
to
arthur
unbuttoned
the
top
of
her
white
dress
and
placed
them
in
her
bosom
is
over
she
said
to
herself
can
never
marry
him
now
that
woman
is
as
far
above
me
as
the
stars
and
sooner
or
later
he
would
find
it
all
out
he
must
go
ah
god
he
must
go
to
marry
why
should
i
not
destroy
these
letters
and
marry
him
bind
him
to
me
by
a
tie
that
no
letters
can
ever
break
what
purchase
his
presence
at
the
price
of
his
daily
scorn
oh
such
water
is
too
bitter
for
me
to
drink
i
have
sinned
against
you
arthur
but
i
will
sin
no
more
my
dear
and
she
laid
her
throbbing
head
upon
the
rail
of
the
verandah
and
wept
bitterly
chapter
lxxiv
about
three
that
afternoon
arthur
returned
to
the
quinta
having
lunched
on
board
the
he
found
mildred
sitting
in
her
favourite
place
on
the
museum
verandah
she
was
very
pale
and
if
he
had
watched
her
he
would
have
seen
that
she
was
trembling
all
over
but
he
did
not
observe
her
particularly
he
said
is
all
nonsense
about
half
the
crew
being
drowned
only
one
man
was
killed
by
the
fall
of
a
spar
poor
chap
they
ran
into
vigo
as
i
thought
the
other
mail
is
just
coming
but
what
is
the
matter
mildred
you
look
dear
i
have
a
good
deal
to
think
of
that
is
yes
well
my
love
have
you
made
up
your
mind
did
i
refuse
to
marry
you
before
for
your
sake
or
mine
arthur
i
mine
what
i
said
i
meant
and
what
i
meant
i
mean

me
in
the
face
dear
and
tell
me
upon
your
honour
as
a
gentleman
that
you
love
me

love
me
and
i
will
marry
you
am
very
fond
of
you
mildred
and
i
will
make
you
a
good
and
true
that
is
what
i
expected
but
it
is
enough
for
me
there
was
a
time
when
i
thought
that
i
could
be
well
satisfied
if
you
would
only
look
kindly
upon
me
but
i
suppose
that
vient
en
for
now
you
do
that
i
am
not
satisfied
i
long
to
reign
alone
but
that
is
not
all
i
will
not
consent
to
tie
you
who
do
not
love
me
to
my
for
life
believe
me
the
time
is
very
near
when
you
would
curse
me
if
i
did
you
she
rose
and
stretched
out
her
you
will
either
marry
me
or
go
i
have
made
my
choice
i
will
not
beat
out
my
heart
against
a
stone
i
will
marry
you
go
arthur
go
a
great
anxiety
came
into
his
face
you
fully
understand
what
you
are
saying
mildred
such
ties
as
exist
between
us
can
not
be
lightly
i
will
break
them
and
my
own
heart
with
them
before
they
become
chains
so
heavy
that
you
can
not
bear
them
she
came
up
to
him
and
put
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
looking
with
wild
and
sorrowful
eyes
straight
into
his
me
now
not
palter
or
put
me
off
with
any
courteous
me
as
truly
as
you
will
speak
upon
the
do
you
still
love
angela
caresfoot
as
much
as
ever
you
should
not
ask
me
such
painful
questions
it
is
not
right
of
is
right
and
you
will
soon
know
that
it
is
answer
if
you
must
have
it
her
face
became
quite
hard
slowly
she
took
her
hands
from
his
shoulders
you
have
the
effrontery
to
ask
me
to
marry
you
with
one
breath
and
to
tell
me
this
with
the
next
arthur
you
had
better
go
do
not
consider
yourself
under
any
false
obligation
to
me
go
and
go
sake
think
what
you
are
doing
mildred
i
have
have
thought
too
much
there
is
nothing
left
but
to
say
yes
it
is
a
very
cruel
word
do
you
know
that
you
have
passed
over
my
life
like
a
hurricane
and
wrenched
it
up
by
the
roots
mildred
you
mystify
me
i
understand
you
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
all
this
she
looked
at
him
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
answered
in
a
quiet
voice
forgot
arthur
here
are
your
english
letters
and
she
drew
them
from
her
bosom
and
gave
them
to
him
they
will
explain
things
a
little
meanwhile
i
will
tell
you
something
angela
husband
is
dead
indeed
she
was
never
married
to
and
then
she
turned
and
slowly
walked
towards
the
entrance
of
the
museum
in
the
boudoir
however
her
strength
seemed
to
fail
her
and
she
sank
on
a
chair
arthur
took
the
letter
written
by
the
woman
he
loved
and
warm
from
the
breast
of
the
woman
he
was
about
to
leave
and
stood
speechless
his
heart
stopped
for
a
moment
and
then
sent
the
blood
bounding
through
his
veins
like
a
flood
of
joy
the
shock
was
so
great
that
for
a
second
or
two
he
staggered
and
nearly
fell
presently
however
he
recovered
himself
and
another
and
very
different
thought
overtook
him
putting
the
letters
into
his
pocket
he
followed
mildred
into
the
boudoir
she
was
sitting
looking
very
faint
upon
a
chair
her
arms
hanging
down
helplessly
by
her
side
he
said
hoarsely
she
looked
up
with
a
faint
air
of
surprise
are
you
not
gone
beyond
what
you
have
just
said
i
know
nothing
of
the
contents
of
these
letters
but
whatever
they
may
be
here
and
now
before
i
read
them
i
again
offer
to
marry
you
i
owe
it
to
you
and
to
my
own
sense
of
what
is
right
that
i
should
marry
he
spoke
calmly
and
with
evident
sincerity
you
know
that
i
read
your
letter
just
now
and
had
half
a
mind
to
burn
it
that
i
am
little
better
than
a
thief
guessed
that
you
had
read
do
you
understand
that
your
angela
is
unmarried
that
she
was
never
really
married
at
that
she
asks
nothing
better
than
to
marry
you
you
still
offer
to
make
me
your
wife
do
what
do
you
say
a
flood
of
light
filled
eyes
as
she
rose
and
confronted
him
say
arthur
that
you
are
a
very
noble
gentleman
and
that
though
from
this
day
i
must
be
a
miserable
woman
i
shall
always
be
proud
to
have
loved
you
listen
my
dear
when
i
read
that
letter
i
felt
that
your
angela
towered
over
me
like
the
alps
her
snowy
purity
stained
only
by
the
reflected
lights
of
heaven
i
felt
that
i
could
not
compete
with
such
a
woman
as
this
that
i
could
never
hope
to
hold
you
from
one
so
calmly
faithful
so
dreadfully
serene
and
i
knew
that
she
had
conquered
robbing
me
for
time
and
as
i
fear
leaving
me
beggared
for
eternity
in
the
magnificence
of
her
undying
power
in
the
calm
certainty
of
her
command
she
flings
me
your
life
as
though
it
were
nothing
it
she
says
will
never
love
is
mine
but
i
can
afford
to
wait
i
shall
claim
him
before
the
throne
of
but
now
look
you
arthur
if
you
can
behave
like
the
hearted
gentleman
you
are
i
will
show
you
that
i
am
not
behind
you
in
generosity
i
will
marry
you
i
have
done
with
you
or
to
be
more
correct
and
she
gave
a
hard
little
laugh
have
done
with
me
go
back
to
angela
the
beautiful
woman
with
inscrutable
grey
eyes
who
waits
for
you
clothed
in
her
eternal
calm
like
a
mountain
in
its
snows
i
shall
send
her
that
tiara
as
a
it
will
become
her
well
go
back
arthur
but
sometimes
when
you
are
cloyed
with
unearthly
virtue
and
perfection
remember
that
a
loved
you
there
i
have
made
you
quite
a
speech
you
will
always
think
of
me
in
connection
with
fine
words
why
you
go
arthur
stood
utterly
confused
what
will
you
do
mildred
she
answered
with
the
same
hard
laugh
trouble
yourself
about
me
i
shall
be
a
happy
woman
yet
i
mean
to
see
life
in
for
pleasure
power
ritualism
whatever
comes
first
perhaps
when
we
meet
again
i
shall
be
lady
minster
or
some
other
great
lady
and
shall
be
able
to
tell
you
that
i
am
very
very
happy
a
woman
always
likes
to
tell
her
old
lover
that
you
know
though
she
would
not
like
him
to
believe
it
perhaps
here
her
eyes
grew
soft
and
her
voice
broke
into
a
shall
have
a
consolation
you
know
nothing
he
did
not
know
what
she
meant
indeed
he
was
with
grief
and
doubt
for
a
moment
more
they
stood
facing
each
other
in
silence
and
then
suddenly
she
flung
her
arms
above
her
head
and
uttering
a
low
cry
of
grief
turned
and
ran
swiftly
down
the
stone
passage
into
the
museum
arthur
hesitated
for
a
while
and
then
followed
her
a
painful
sight
awaited
him
in
that
silent
chamber
for
stretched
on
the
ground
before
the
statue
of
osiris
like
some
hopeless
sinner
before
an
inexorable
justice
with
her
brown
hair
touched
to
gold
by
a
ray
of
sunlight
from
the
mildred
as
still
as
though
she
were
dead
he
went
to
her
and
tried
to
raise
her
but
she
wrenched
herself
loose
and
in
an
abandonment
of
misery
flung
herself
upon
the
ground
again
thought
it
was
over
she
said
that
you
were
gone
go
dear
or
this
will
drive
me
mad
perhaps
sometimes
you
will
write
he
knelt
beside
her
and
kissed
her
and
then
he
rose
and
went
but
for
many
a
year
was
he
haunted
by
that
scene
of
human
misery
enacted
in
the
weird
chamber
of
the
dead
never
could
he
forget
the
sight
of
mildred
lying
in
the
sunlight
with
the
marble
face
of
mocking
calm
looking
down
upon
her
and
the
mortal
frames
of
those
who
in
their
day
had
suffered
as
she
suffered
and
ages
since
had
found
the
rest
that
she
in
time
would
reach
scattered
all
emblems
of
the
fragile
vanity
of
passions
which
suck
their
strength
from
earth
alone
chapter
lxxv
when
arthur
got
out
of
the
gates
of
the
quinta
carr
he
hurried
to
the
hotel
with
the
intention
of
reading
the
letters
mildred
had
given
him
and
passing
through
the
seated
himself
upon
the
which
overlooked
the
garden
in
order
to
do
so
at
this
time
of
year
it
was
generally
speaking
a
quiet
place
enough
but
on
this
particular
day
scarcely
had
arthur
taken
the
letter
from
his
pocket
placed
the
ring
that
it
contained
upon
his
trembling
finger
and
repudiating
the
statement
marked
be
read
first
on
account
of
its
at
the
two
first
lines
of
own
letter
when
the
sound
of
hurrying
feet
and
many
chattering
voices
reminded
him
that
he
could
expect
no
peace
anywhere
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
hotel
the
second
english
mail
was
in
and
all
the
crowd
of
passengers
who
were
at
this
time
pouring
out
to
the
cape
to
escape
the
english
winter
had
come
rejoicing
ashore
to
eat
drink
be
merry
and
buy
parrots
and
wicker
chairs
while
the
vessel
coaled
he
groaned
and
fled
in
his
hurry
leaving
the
statement
on
the
bench
on
which
he
was
seated
some
or
so
away
to
the
left
of
the
town
where
the
sea
had
encroached
a
little
upon
the
shore
of
the
island
there
was
a
nook
of
peculiar
loveliness
here
the
giant
hand
of
nature
had
cleft
a
ravine
in
the
mountains
that
make
madeira
down
which
a
crystal
streamlet
trickled
to
the
patch
of
yellow
sand
that
edged
the
sea
its
banks
sloped
like
a
natural
terrace
and
were
clothed
with
masses
of
maidenhair
ferns
interwoven
with
feathery
grasses
whilst
up
above
among
the
rocks
grew
aloes
and
every
sort
of
flowering
shrub
behind
clothed
in
forest
lay
the
mass
of
mountains
varied
by
the
rich
green
of
the
valleys
and
in
front
heaved
the
endless
ocean
broken
only
by
one
lonely
rock
that
stood
grimly
out
against
the
purpling
glories
of
the
evening
sky
this
spot
arthur
had
discovered
in
the
course
of
his
rambles
with
mildred
and
it
was
here
that
he
bent
his
steps
to
be
alone
to
read
his
letters
scarcely
had
he
reached
the
place
however
when
he
discovered
to
his
intense
vexation
that
he
had
left
the
enclosure
in
letter
upon
the
verandah
at
the
hotel
but
luckily
it
chanced
that
within
a
few
yards
of
the
spot
where
he
had
seated
himself
there
was
a
native
boy
cutting
from
the
scrub
he
called
to
him
in
portuguese
of
which
he
had
learnt
a
little
and
writing
something
on
a
card
told
him
to
take
it
to
the
manager
of
the
hotel
and
to
bring
back
what
he
would
give
him
delighted
at
the
chance
of
earning
sixpence
the
boy
started
at
a
run
and
at
last
he
was
able
to
begin
to
read
his
letter
had
arthur
not
been
in
quite
such
a
hurry
to
leave
the
hotel
he
might
have
seen
something
which
would
have
interested
him
namely
a
very
lovely
lovely
indeed
that
everybody
turned
their
heads
to
look
at
her
as
she
passed
accompanied
by
another
woman
clad
in
a
stiff
black
gown
not
at
all
lovely
and
rather
ancient
but
for
all
that
and
pleasant
to
look
on
being
duly
convoyed
to
their
room
in
the
hotel
by
his
friend
the
manager
thank
my
stars
here
we
be
at
last
said
the
elderly
stout
person
with
a
gasp
as
the
door
of
the
room
closed
upon
the
pair
my
opinion
that
here
i
shall
stop
till
my
dying
day
for
as
for
getting
on
board
one
of
those
beastly
ships
again
i
do
it
and
flat
now
look
here
dearie
you
sit
there
and
look
frightened
but
just
set
to
and
clean
yourself
up
a
bit
off
downstairs
to
see
if
i
can
find
out
about
things
sure
to
know
everybody
business
in
a
place
like
this
because
you
see
the
gossip
get
out
of
a
bit
of
an
island
it
must
travel
round
and
round
till
it
ewaporates
i
shall
soon
know
if
he
is
married
or
not
and
if
he
is
why
done
be
undone
and
no
use
crying
over
spilt
milk
and
be
off
home
though
i
doubt
i
live
to
get
there
and
if
he
why
so
much
the
nurse
do
stop
talking
and
go
quickly
you
see
that
i
am
in
an
agony
of
suspense
i
must
get
it
over
one
way
or
the
no
cattle
my
dear
or
i
shall
make
a
mess
of
it
now
miss
angela
just
you
keep
cool
it
no
manner
of
use
flying
into
a
state
be
back
but
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
poor
angela
flew
into
a
considerable
state
for
flinging
herself
upon
her
knees
by
the
bed
she
broke
into
hysterical
prayers
to
her
maker
that
arthur
might
not
be
taken
from
her
poor
girl
alternately
racked
by
sick
fears
and
wild
hopes
hers
was
not
a
very
enviable
position
during
the
apparently
endless
ten
minutes
that
followed
meanwhile
pigott
had
descended
to
the
cool
hall
round
which
were
arranged
rows
of
hammocks
and
was
looking
out
for
some
one
with
whom
to
enter
into
conversation
a
portuguese
waiter
approached
her
but
she
majestically
waved
him
away
under
the
impression
that
he
could
not
speak
english
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
english
was
purer
than
her
own
presently
a
pretty
little
woman
leading
a
baby
by
the
hand
came
up
to
her
do
you
want
anything
i
am
the
wife
of
the
i
want
a
little
least
another
that
does
did
you
ever
happen
to
hear
of
a
heigham
heigham
indeed
yes
i
know
him
well
he
was
here
a
few
minutes
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
if
he
is
married
to
a
carr
that
lives
on
this
island
that
i
know
of
she
answered
with
a
little
smile
there
is
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
say
that
though
they
are
not
married
they
ought
to
be
you
the
best
bit
of
news
i
have
heard
for
many
a
day
as
for
the
talk
i
pay
no
manner
of
heed
to
that
if
he
married
to
her
he
marry
her
now
go
bail
thank
you
kindly
at
that
moment
they
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
little
ragged
boy
into
the
hall
who
timidly
held
out
a
card
to
the
lady
to
whom
pigott
was
talking
you
want
to
find
heigham
she
said
if
so
this
boy
will
show
you
where
he
is
he
has
sent
here
for
a
paper
that
he
left
i
found
it
on
the
verandah
just
now
and
wondered
what
it
was
perhaps
you
would
take
it
to
him
if
you
go
i
like
trusting
this
likely
as
not
he
will
lose
will
just
suit
just
you
tell
the
boy
to
wait
while
i
fetch
my
young
lady
and
we
will
go
with
him
is
this
the
paper
and
in
her
writing
too
well
i
never
there
be
back
in
no
pigott
went
upstairs
far
too
rapidly
for
a
person
of
her
size
and
years
with
the
result
that
when
she
reached
their
room
where
angela
was
waiting
half
dead
with
suspense
she
could
only
gasp
said
angela
quick
and
tell
lord
them
stairs
gasped
pigott
sake
tell
me
the
worst
miss
give
a
body
time
and
be
a
pardon
pigott
you
are
torturing
me
miss
you
muddle
me
i
am
coming
to
it
i
went
down
them
dratted
stairs
and
there
i
see
a
wonderful
party
with
a
sake
tell
arthur
married
no
course
not
i
was
just
to
but
whatever
valuable
remark
pigott
was
going
to
make
was
lost
to
the
world
for
ever
for
angela
flung
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
began
kissing
her
oh
thank
god
oh
oh
oh
whereupon
pigott
being
a
very
sensible
person
took
her
by
the
shoulders
and
tried
to
shake
her
but
it
was
no
joke
shaking
a
person
of
her
height
angela
stood
firm
and
pigott
was
the
only
visible
result
then
miss
she
said
giving
up
the
shaking
as
a
bad
job
highstrikes
you
please
just
you
put
on
your
hat
and
come
for
a
bit
of
a
walk
in
this
queer
place
with
me
i
brought
you
up
by
hand
this
year
or
thereabouts
to
see
you
go
off
in
highstrikes
like
a
housemaid
as
has
seen
a
angela
stopped
and
did
as
she
was
bid
chapter
lxxvi
arthur
read
his
letter
and
his
heart
burnt
with
passionate
love
of
the
true
woman
he
had
dared
to
doubt
then
he
flung
himself
upon
the
grass
and
looked
at
the
ocean
that
sparkled
and
heaved
before
him
and
tried
to
think
but
as
yet
he
could
not
the
engines
of
his
mind
were
reversed
full
speed
whilst
his
mind
itself
with
quick
shudders
and
confusion
still
forged
ahead
upon
its
former
course
he
rose
and
cast
upon
the
scene
around
him
that
long
look
we
give
to
the
place
where
a
great
happiness
has
found
us
the
sun
was
sinking
fast
behind
the
mountains
turning
their
slabbed
sides
and
soaring
pinnacles
to
giant
shields
and
spears
of
fire
beneath
their
mass
of
the
over
the
forests
and
the
crested
rollers
whilst
further
from
him
the
ocean
heaved
in
a
rosy
glow
above
the
vault
of
heaven
was
of
a
beauty
that
no
brush
could
paint
on
a
of
burning
red
were
piled
height
upon
height
deep
ridges
of
purples
and
of
crimsons
nearer
the
horizon
the
colours
brightened
to
a
dazzling
gold
till
at
length
they
narrowed
to
the
white
intensity
of
the
hidden
eye
of
the
sun
vanishing
behind
the
mountains
whilst
underlying
the
steady
splendour
of
the
upper
skies
flushed
soft
and
melting
shades
of
rose
and
lilac
blue
space
above
him
was
broken
up
by
fantastic
clouds
that
floated
all
on
fire
and
glowed
like
molten
metal
the
reflection
too
of
all
these
massed
and
varied
lights
in
the
azure
of
the
eastern
skies
was
full
of
sharp
contrasts
and
soft
surprises
and
a
travelling
eagle
sailing
through
space
before
them
seemed
to
gather
all
their
tints
upon
his
vivid
wings
and
as
he
passed
away
to
leave
a
rainbow
track
of
broken
light
but
such
a
glory
was
too
bright
to
last
the
sun
sank
swiftly
the
celestial
fires
paled
the
purples
grew
faint
and
died
and
where
they
had
been
night
trailed
her
sombre
plumes
across
the
sea
and
sky
but
still
the
quiet
glow
of
evening
lingered
and
presently
a
line
of
light
was
shot
athwart
it
cutting
a
track
of
glory
across
the
shadowed
sea
so
weird
and
sudden
that
it
might
well
have
been
the
first
ray
of
a
resurrection
morn
breaking
in
upon
the
twilight
of
the
dead
he
gazed
almost
in
awe
till
the
majestic
sight
stilled
the
tumult
of
his
heart
and
his
thoughts
went
up
in
thanks
to
the
creator
for
the
pure
love
he
had
found
again
and
which
had
not
betrayed
him
then
he
looked
up
and
there
stately
and
radiant
standing
out
clear
against
the
shadows
her
face
illumined
by
that
soft
yet
vivid
light
her
trembling
arms
outstretched
to
clasp
his
lost
angela
he
saw
her
questioning
glances
fall
upon
him
and
the
red
blood
waver
on
her
cheek
he
saw
the
gather
in
her
eyes
and
then
he
saw
no
more
for
she
was
in
his
arms
murmuring
sweet
broken
words
happy
are
those
who
thus
shall
find
their
angela
whether
it
be
here
the
further
shore
of
yonder
solemn
sea
and
mildred
she
lay
there
before
the
stone
symbol
of
inexorable
judgment
and
sobbed
till
the
darkness
covered
her
and
her
heart
broke
in
the
silence
