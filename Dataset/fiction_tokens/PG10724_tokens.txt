chapter
i
ben
barclay
meets
a
tramp
give
me
a
ride
ben
barclay
checked
the
horse
he
was
driving
and
looked
attentively
at
the
speaker
he
was
a
man
with
a
beard
of
a
week
growth
wearing
an
old
and
dirty
suit
which
would
have
reduced
any
tailor
to
despair
if
taken
to
him
for
cleaning
and
repairs
a
loose
hat
with
a
torn
crown
surmounted
a
singularly
visage
a
tramp
and
a
hard
looking
one
said
ben
to
himself
he
hesitated
about
answering
being
naturally
reluctant
to
have
such
a
traveling
companion
well
what
do
you
say
demanded
the
tramp
rather
impatiently
there
plenty
of
room
on
that
seat
and
i
dead
tired
where
are
you
going
asked
ben
same
way
you
are
to
pentonville
you
can
ride
said
ben
in
a
tone
by
means
cordial
and
he
halted
his
horse
till
his
unsavory
companion
climbed
into
the
wagon
they
were
two
miles
from
pentonville
and
ben
had
a
prospect
of
a
longer
ride
than
he
desired
under
the
circumstances
his
companion
pulled
out
a
dirty
clay
pipe
from
his
pocket
and
filled
it
with
tobacco
and
then
explored
another
pocket
for
a
match
a
muttered
oath
showed
that
he
failed
to
find
one
got
a
match
boy
he
asked
no
answered
ben
glad
to
have
escaped
the
offensive
fumes
of
the
pipe
just
my
luck
growled
the
tramp
putting
back
the
pipe
with
a
look
of
disappointment
if
you
had
a
match
now
i
would
mind
letting
you
have
a
whiff
or
two
i
do
smoke
answered
ben
hardly
able
to
repress
a
look
of
disgust
so
you
a
good
boy
eh
one
of
the
sunday
school
kids
that
want
to
be
an
angel
hey
pah
and
the
tramp
exhibited
the
disgust
which
the
idea
gave
him
yes
i
go
to
sunday
school
said
ben
coldly
feeling
more
and
more
repelled
by
his
companion
i
never
went
to
sunday
school
said
his
companion
and
i
would
it
only
good
for
milksops
and
hypocrites
do
you
think
you
any
better
for
not
going
ben
could
help
asking

so
prosperous

straightforward
man

where
to

ben
i

i
do

no
man
to
doubt
my
word
nor
no
boy

a
dime
a
dime

i
am
working
in
a
store
for
a
very
smell
salary
and
that
i
pay
over
to
my
mother
whose
store
simon
crawford
but
you
wo
know
any
better
for
my
telling
you
that

acquainted
in
pentonville
i

through
there
crawford
keeps
the
grocery
store
yes
what
your
name
ben
barclay
answered
our
hero
feeling
rather
annoyed
at
what
he
considered
intrusive
curiosity
barclay
replied
the
tramp
quickly
not
john
barclay
son
it
was
ben
turn
to
be
surprised
he
was
the
son
of
john
barclay
deceased
but
how
could
his
traveling
companion
know
that
did
you
know
my
father
asked
the
boy
astonished
i
heerd
his
name
answered
the
tramp
in
an
evasive
tone
what
is
your
name
asked
ben
feeling
that
be
had
a
right
to
be
as
curious
as
his
companion
i
have
got
any
visitin
cards
with
me
answered
the
tramp
dryly
nor
i
but
i
told
you
my
name
all
right
i
tell
you
mine
you
can
call
me
jack
frost
i
gave
you
my
real
name
said
ben
significantly
i
almost
forgotten
what
my
real
name
is
said
the
tramp
if
you
do
like
jack
frost
you
can
call
me
george
washington
ben
laughed
i
do
think
that
name
would
suit
he
said
george
washington
never
told
a
lie
what
d
mean
by
that
demanded
the
tramp
his
brow
darkening
i
was
joking
answered
ben
who
did
not
care
to
get
into
difficulty
with
such
a
man
i
going
to
joke
a
little
myself
growled
the
tramp
as
looking
quickly
about
him
he
observed
that
they
were
riding
over
a
lonely
section
of
the
road
lined
with
woods
have
you
got
any
money
about
you
ben
taken
by
surprise
would
have
been
glad
to
answer
no
but
he
was
a
boy
of
truth
and
could
not
say
so
truly
though
he
might
have
felt
justified
in
doing
so
under
the
circumstances
come
i
see
you
have
give
it
to
me
right
off
or
it
be
worse
for
you
now
it
happened
that
ben
had
not
less
than
dollars
about
him
he
had
carried
some
groceries
to
a
remote
part
of
the
town
and
collected
two
bills
on
the
way
all
this
money
he
had
in
a
wallet
in
the
pocket
on
the
other
side
from
the
tramp
but
the
money
was
not
his
it
belonged
to
his
employer
and
he
was
not
disposed
to
give
it
up
without
a
struggle
though
he
knew
that
in
point
of
strength
he
was
not
an
equal
match
for
the
man
beside
him
you
will
get
no
money
from
me
he
answered
in
a
firm
tone
though
be
felt
far
from
comfortable
i
wo
hey
growled
the
tramp
d
think
i
goin
to
let
a
boy
like
you
get
the
best
of
me
he
clutched
ben
by
the
arm
and
seemed
in
a
fair
way
to
overcome
opposition
by
superior
strength
when
a
fortunate
idea
struck
ben
in
his
vest
pocket
was
a
silver
dollar
which
had
been
taken
at
the
store
but
proving
to
be
counterfeit
had
been
given
to
ben
by
crawford
as
a
curiosity
this
ben
extracted
from
his
pocket
and
flung
out
by
the
roadside
if
you
want
it
you
have
to
get
out
and
get
it
he
said
the
tramp
saw
the
coin
glistening
upon
the
ground
and
had
no
suspicion
of
its
not
being
genuine
it
was
not
much
only
a
dollar
but
he
was
dead
broke
and
it
was
worth
picking
up
he
had
not
expected
that
ben
had
much
and
so
was
not
disappointed
curse
you
he
said
relinquishing
his
hold
upon
ben
why
you
give
it
to
me
instead
of
throwing
it
out
there
because
answered
ben
boldly
i
did
want
you
to
have
it
get
out
and
get
it
for
me
i
wo
answered
ben
firmly
then
stop
the
horse
and
give
me
a
chance
to
get
out
i
do
that
ben
brought
the
horse
to
a
halt
and
his
unwelcome
passenger
descended
much
to
his
relief
he
had
to
walk
around
the
wagon
to
get
at
the
coin
our
hero
brought
down
the
whip
with
emphasis
on
the
horse
back
and
the
animal
dashed
off
at
a
good
rate
of
speed
stop
exclaimed
the
tramp
but
ben
had
no
mind
to
heed
his
call
no
my
friend
you
do
get
another
chance
to
ride
with
me
he
said
to
himself
the
tramp
picked
up
the
coin
and
his
practiced
eye
detected
that
it
was
bogus
the
young
villain
he
muttered
angrily
i
like
to
wring
his
neck
it
a
bad
one
after
all
he
looked
after
the
receding
team
and
was
half
disposed
to
follow
but
he
changed
his
mind
reflecting
i
can
pass
it
anyhow
instead
of
pursuing
his
journey
he
made
his
way
into
the
woods
and
stretching
himself
out
among
the
underbrush
went
to
sleep
half
a
mile
before
reaching
the
store
ben
overtook
rose
gardiner
who
had
the
reputation
of
being
the
prettiest
girl
in
pendleton
at
any
rate
such
was
ben
opinion
she
looked
up
and
smiled
pleasantly
at
ben
as
he
took
off
his
hat
shall
you
attend
harrington
entertainment
at
the
town
hall
this
evening
ben
she
asked
after
they
had
interchanged
greetings
i
should
like
to
go
answered
ben
but
i
am
afraid
i
ca
be
spared
from
the
store
shall
you
go
i
would
miss
it
for
anything
i
hope
i
shall
see
you
there
i
shall
want
to
go
all
the
more
then
answered
ben
gallantly
you
say
that
to
flatter
me
said
the
young
lady
with
an
arch
smile
no
i
do
said
ben
earnestly
wo
you
get
in
and
ride
as
far
as
the
store
would
it
be
proper
asked
miss
rose
demurely
of
course
it
would
then
i
venture
ben
jumped
from
the
wagon
assisted
the
young
lady
in
and
the
two
drove
into
the
village
together
he
liked
his
second
passenger
considerably
better
than
the
first
chapter
ii
ben
and
his
mother
ben
barclay
after
taking
leave
of
the
tramp
lost
no
time
in
driving
to
the
grocery
store
where
he
was
employed
it
was
a
large
country
store
devoted
not
to
groceries
alone
but
supplies
of
boots
and
shoes
and
the
leading
articles
required
in
the
community
there
were
two
other
clerks
besides
ben
one
the
son
another
the
nephew
of
simon
crawford
the
proprietor
did
you
collect
any
money
ben
asked
simon
who
chanced
to
be
standing
at
the
door
when
our
hero
drove
up
yes
sir
i
collected
dollars
but
came
near
losing
it
on
the
way
home
how
was
that
i
hope
you
were
not
careless
no
except
in
taking
a
stranger
as
a
passenger
when
we
got
to
that
piece
of
woods
a
mile
back
he
asked
me
for
all
the
money
i
had
a
highwayman
and
so
near
pentonville
ejaculated
simon
crawford
what
was
he
like
a
regular
tramp
yet
you
say
you
have
the
money
how
did
you
manage
to
keep
it
from
him
ben
detailed
the
stratagem
of
which
he
made
use
you
did
well
said
the
storekeeper
approvingly
i
must
give
you
a
dollar
for
the
one
you
sacrificed
but
sir
it
was
bad
money
i
could
have
passed
it
that
does
not
matter
you
are
entitled
to
some
reward
for
the
courage
and
quick
wit
you
displayed
here
is
a
dollar
and
let
me
see
there
is
an
entertainment
at
the
town
hall
this
evening
there
yes
sir
harrington
the
magician
gives
an
entertainment
said
ben
eagerly
at
what
time
does
it
commence
at
eight
you
may
leave
the
store
at
seven
that
will
give
you
enough
time
to
get
there
thank
you
sir
i
wanted
to
go
to
the
entertainment
but
did
not
like
to
ask
for
the
evening
you
have
earned
it
here
is
the
dollar
and
crawford
handed
the
money
to
his
young
clerk
who
received
it
gratefully
a
magical
entertainment
may
be
a
very
common
affair
to
my
young
readers
in
the
city
but
in
a
country
village
it
is
an
event
pentonville
was
too
small
to
have
any
regular
place
of
amusement
and
its
citizens
were
obliged
to
depend
upon
traveling
performers
who
from
time
to
time
engaged
the
town
hall
some
time
had
elapsed
since
there
had
been
any
such
entertainment
and
harrington
was
the
more
likely
to
be
well
patronized
ben
who
had
the
love
of
amusement
common
to
boys
of
his
age
had
been
regretting
the
necessity
of
remaining
in
the
store
till
nine
and
therefore
losing
his
share
of
amusement
when
as
we
have
seen
an
opportunity
suddenly
offered
i
am
glad
i
met
the
tramp
after
all
he
said
to
himself
he
has
brought
me
luck
at
supper
he
told
is
mother
what
had
befallen
him
but
she
tool
a
more
serious
view
of
it
than
he
did
he
might
have
murdered
you
ben
she
said
with
a
shudder
oh
no
he
would
do
that
he
might
have
stolen
money
that
was
the
most
that
was
likely
to
happen
i
did
think
there
were
highwaymen
about
here
now
i
shall
be
worrying
about
you
do
do
that
mother
i
do
feel
in
any
danger
still
if
you
think
it
best
i
will
carry
a
pistol
no
no
ben
it
might
go
off
and
kill
you
i
would
rather
run
the
risk
of
a
highwayman
i
wonder
if
the
man
is
prowling
about
in
the
neighborhood
yet
i
do
think
my
bogus
dollar
will
carry
him
very
far
by
the
way
mother
i
must
tell
yon
one
strange
thing
he
asked
me
if
i
was
john
barclay
son
what
exclaimed
barclay
in
a
tone
of
great
surprise
did
he
know
your
name
was
barclay
not
till
i
told
him
then
it
was
he
asked
if
i
was
the
son
of
john
barclay
did
he
say
he
knew
your
father
i
asked
him
but
he
answered
evasively
he
might
have
seen
some
resemblance
that
is
if
he
had
ever
met
your
father
ah
it
was
a
sad
day
for
us
all
when
your
poor
father
died
we
should
have
been
in
a
very
different
position
the
widow
sighed
yes
mother
said
ben
but
when
i
get
older
i
will
try
to
supply
my
father
place
and
relieve
you
from
care
and
trouble
you
are
doing
that
in
a
measure
now
my
dear
boy
said
barclay
affectionately
you
are
a
great
comfort
to
me
ben
answer
was
to
go
up
to
his
mother
and
kiss
her
some
boys
of
his
age
are
ashamed
to
show
their
love
for
the
mother
who
is
devoted
to
them
but
it
a
false
shame
that
does
them
no
credit
still
mother
you
work
too
hard
said
ben
wait
till
i
am
a
man
and
you
shall
not
need
to
work
at
all
barclay
had
been
a
widow
for
five
years
her
husband
had
been
a
commercial
traveler
but
had
contracted
a
fever
at
chicago
and
died
after
a
brief
illness
without
his
wife
having
the
satisfaction
of
ministering
to
him
in
his
last
days
a
small
sum
due
him
from
his
employers
was
paid
over
to
his
family
but
no
property
was
discovered
though
his
wife
had
been
under
the
impression
that
her
husband
possessed
some
he
had
never
been
in
the
habit
of
confiding
his
business
affairs
to
her
and
so
if
he
had
investments
of
any
kind
she
could
not
learn
anything
about
them
she
found
herself
therefore
with
no
property
except
a
small
cottage
worth
with
its
quarter
acre
of
land
perhaps
fifteen
hundred
dollars
as
ben
was
too
small
to
earn
anything
she
had
been
compelled
to
raise
about
seven
hundred
dollars
on
mortgage
which
by
this
time
had
been
expended
for
living
now
ben
was
earning
four
dollars
a
week
and
with
her
own
earnings
she
was
able
to
make
both
ends
meet
without
further
encroachments
upon
her
scanty
property
but
the
mortgage
was
a
source
of
anxiety
to
her
especially
as
it
was
held
by
squire
davenport
a
lawyer
of
considerable
means
who
was
not
overscrupulous
about
the
methods
by
which
he
strove
to
increase
his
hoards
should
he
at
any
time
take
it
into
his
head
to
foreclose
there
was
no
one
to
whom
barclay
could
apply
to
assume
the
mortgage
and
she
was
likely
to
be
compelled
to
sacrifice
her
home
he
had
more
than
once
hinted
that
he
might
need
the
money
but
as
yet
had
gone
no
further
barclay
had
one
comfort
however
and
a
great
one
this
was
a
good
son
ben
was
always
kind
to
his
mother
a
bright
popular
promising
boy
and
though
at
present
he
was
unable
to
earn
much
in
a
few
years
he
would
be
able
to
earn
a
good
income
and
then
his
mother
knew
that
she
would
be
well
provided
for
so
she
did
not
allow
herself
to
borrow
trouble
but
looked
forward
hopefully
thanking
god
for
what
he
had
given
her
wo
you
go
up
to
the
town
hall
with
me
mother
asked
ben
i
am
sure
you
would
enjoy
it
thank
you
ben
for
wishing
me
to
have
a
share
in
your
amusements
his
mother
replied
but
i
have
a
little
headache
this
evening
and
i
shall
be
better
off
at
home
it
is
on
account
of
the
expense
you
decline
mother
is
it
you
know
crawford
gave
me
a
dollar
and
the
tickets
are
but
cents
no
it
is
that
ben
if
it
were
a
concert
i
might
be
tempted
to
go
in
spite
of
my
headache
but
a
magical
entertainment
would
not
amuse
me
as
much
as
it
will
you
just
as
you
think
best
mother
but
i
should
like
to
have
you
go
you
wo
feel
lonely
will
you
i
am
used
to
being
alone
till
nine
when
you
are
at
the
store
this
conversation
took
place
at
the
supper
table
ben
went
directly
from
the
store
to
the
town
hall
where
he
enjoyed
himself
as
much
as
he
anticipated
if
he
could
have
foreseen
how
his
mother
was
to
pass
that
evening
it
would
have
destroyed
all
is
enjoyment
chapter
iii
barclay
callers
about
eight
barclay
sat
with
her
work
in
her
hand
her
headache
was
better
but
she
did
not
regret
not
having
accompanied
ben
to
the
town
hall
i
am
glad
ben
is
enjoying
himself
she
thought
but
i
would
rather
stay
quietly
at
home
poor
boy
he
works
hard
enough
and
needs
recreation
now
and
then
just
then
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
outside
door
i
wonder
who
it
can
be
thought
the
widow
i
supposed
everybody
would
be
at
the
town
hall
it
may
be
perkins
come
to
borrow
something
perkins
was
a
neighbor
much
addicted
to
borrowing
which
was
rather
disagreeable
but
might
have
been
more
easily
tolerated
but
that
she
seldom
returned
the
articles
lent
barclay
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
fully
expecting
to
see
her
borrowing
neighbor
a
very
different
person
met
her
view
the
ragged
hat
the
face
the
neglected
attire
led
her
to
recognize
the
tramp
whom
ben
had
described
to
her
as
having
attempted
to
rob
him
in
the
afternoon
terrified
barclay
first
impulse
was
to
shut
the
door
and
bolt
it
but
her
unwelcome
visitor
was
too
quick
for
her
thrusting
his
foot
into
the
doorway
he
interposed
an
effectual
obstacle
in
the
way
of
shutting
the
door
no
you
do
he
said
with
as
laugh
i
understand
your
little
game
you
want
to
shut
me
out
what
do
you
want
asked
the
widow
apprehensively
what
do
i
want
returned
the
tramp
well
to
begin
with
i
want
something
to
eat
and
drink
he
added
after
a
pause
why
do
you
go
to
the
tavern
asked
barclay
anxious
for
him
to
depart
well
i
ca
afford
it
all
the
money
i
got
is
a
bogus
dollar
your
rogue
of
a
son
gave
me
this
afternoon
you
stole
it
from
him
said
the
widow
indignantly
what
the
odds
if
i
did
it
ai
of
no
value
come
have
you
anything
to
eat
in
the
house
i
hungry
as
a
wolf
and
you
look
like
one
thought
barclay
glancing
at
his
unattractive
features
but
she
did
not
dare
to
say
it
there
seemed
no
way
of
refusing
and
she
was
glad
to
comply
with
his
request
if
by
so
doing
she
could
soon
get
rid
of
him
stay
here
she
said
and
i
bring
you
some
bread
and
butter
and
cold
meat
thank
you
i
rather
come
in
said
the
tramp
and
he
pushed
his
way
through
the
partly
open
door
she
led
the
way
uneasily
into
the
kitchen
just
in
the
rear
of
the
sitting
room
where
she
had
been
seated
i
wish
ben
was
here
she
said
to
herself
with
sinking
heart
the
tramp
seated
himself
at
the
kitchen
table
while
barclay
going
to
the
pantry
brought
out
part
of
a
loaf
of
bread
and
butter
and
a
few
slices
of
cold
beef
which
she
set
before
him
without
ceremony
he
attacked
the
viands
and
ate
as
if
half
famished
when
about
half
through
he
turned
to
the
widow
and
asked
have
you
some
whisky
in
the
house
i
never
keep
any
answered
barclay
rum
or
gin
then
i
ai
i
want
something
to
warm
me
up
i
keep
no
liquor
of
any
kind
i
do
approve
of
drink
or
want
ben
to
touch
it
oh
you
belong
to
the
cold
water
army
do
you
said
the
tramp
with
a
sneer
give
me
some
coffee
then
i
have
no
fire
and
can
not
prepare
any
what
have
you
got
then
demanded
than
unwelcome
guest
impatiently
i
can
give
you
a
glass
of
excellent
well
water
illegible
do
you
want
to
choke
me
returned
the
tramp
in
disgust
suppose
i
mix
you
some
molasses
and
water
suggested
the
widow
anxious
to
propitiate
her
dangerous
guest
humph
well
that
will
do
if
you
got
nothing
better
be
quick
about
it
for
my
throat
is
parched
as
soon
as
possible
the
drink
was
prepared
and
set
beside
his
plate
he
drained
it
at
a
draught
and
called
for
a
second
glass
which
was
supplied
him
presently
for
all
things
must
have
an
end
the
appetite
seemed
to
be
satisfied
he
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
stretched
his
legs
and
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
widow
i
feel
better
he
said
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
said
barclay
now
if
you
be
kind
enough
leave
the
house
for
i
expect
ben
back
before
long
and
you
do
want
him
to
get
hurt
laughed
the
tramp
well
i
do
owe
him
a
flogging
for
a
trick
he
played
on
me
oh
pray
go
away
said
barclay
apprehensively
i
have
given
you
some
supper
and
that
ought
to
satisfy
you
i
ca
go
away
till
i
talked
to
you
a
little
on
business
business
what
business
can
you
have
with
me
more
than
you
think
you
are
the
widow
of
john
barclay
ai
you
yes
did
you
know
my
husband
yes
that
is
i
saw
something
of
him
just
before
he
died
can
you
tell
me
anything
about
his
last
moments
asked
the
widow
forgetting
the
character
of
her
visitor
and
only
thinking
of
her
husband
no
that
is
in
my
line
i
ai
a
doctor
nor
yet
a
minister
i
say
did
he
leave
any
money
not
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
out
he
owned
this
hone
but
left
no
other
property
that
you
know
of
said
the
tramp
significantly
do
you
know
of
any
asked
barclay
eagerly
how
did
you
happen
to
know
him
i
was
the
barkeeper
in
the
hotel
where
he
died
it
was
a
small
house
not
one
of
your
hotels
my
husband
was
always
careful
of
his
expenses
he
did
not
spend
money
unnecessarily
with
his
prudence
we
all
thought
he
must
have
some
investments
but
we
could
discover
none
have
you
got
any
money
in
the
house
asked
the
tramp
with
seeming
abruptness
why
do
you
ask
returned
the
widow
alarmed
surely
you
would
not
rob
me
no
i
do
want
to
rob
you
i
want
to
sell
you
something
i
do
care
to
buy
it
takes
all
our
money
for
necessary
expenses
you
do
ask
what
i
have
to
sell
no
because
i
can
not
buy
it
whatever
it
may
be
it
is
a
secret
said
the
tramp
a
secret
repeated
barclay
bewildered
yes
and
a
secret
worth
buying
your
husband
was
so
poor
as
you
think
he
left
stock
and
papers
representing
three
thousand
dollars
and
i
am
the
only
man
who
can
put
you
in
the
way
of
getting
it
barclay
was
about
to
express
her
surprise
when
a
loud
knock
was
head
at
the
outer
door
who
that
demanded
the
tramp
quickly
is
it
the
boy
no
he
would
not
knock
then
let
me
get
out
of
this
he
said
leaping
to
his
feet
there
a
back
door
yes
there
it
is
he
hurried
to
the
door
unbolted
it
and
made
his
escape
into
the
open
beyond
the
house
just
as
the
knock
was
repeated
confused
by
what
she
had
heard
and
the
strange
conduct
of
her
visitor
the
widow
took
the
lamp
and
went
to
the
door
to
her
surprise
she
found
on
opening
it
two
visitors
in
one
of
whom
she
recognized
squire
davenport
already
referred
to
as
holding
a
mortgage
on
her
house
the
other
was
a
short
man
who
looked
like
a
mechanic
excuse
me
the
lateness
of
my
call
barclay
said
the
squire
smoothly
i
come
on
important
business
this
is
kirk
a
cousin
of
my
wife
walk
in
gentlemen
said
barclay
this
is
night
of
surprises
she
thought
to
herself
chapter
iv
unpleasant
business
it
was
now
nine
rather
a
late
hour
for
callers
in
the
country
and
barclay
waited
not
without
curiosity
to
hear
the
nature
of
the
business
which
had
brought
her
two
visitors
at
that
time
take
seats
gentlemen
she
said
with
the
courtesy
habitual
to
her
squire
davenport
who
was
disposed
to
consider
that
he
had
a
right
to
the
best
of
everything
seated
himself
in
the
and
signed
his
companion
to
a
cane
chair
beside
him
kirk
he
commenced
is
thinking
of
coming
to
pentonville
to
live
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
said
barclay
politely
perhaps
she
would
not
have
said
this
if
she
had
known
what
was
coming
next
he
is
a
carpenter
continued
the
squire
and
as
we
have
none
in
the
village
except
old
wade
who
is
superannuated
i
think
he
will
find
enough
to
do
to
keep
him
busy
i
should
think
so
assented
the
widow
if
he
does
not
i
can
employ
him
a
part
of
the
time
on
my
land
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
me
thought
barclay
she
soon
learned
of
course
he
will
need
a
house
pursued
the
squire
and
as
his
family
is
small
he
thinks
this
house
will
just
suit
him
but
i
do
wish
to
sell
said
the
widow
hurriedly
i
need
this
house
for
ben
and
myself
you
could
doubtless
find
other
accommodations
i
dare
say
you
could
hire
a
couple
of
rooms
from
elnathan
perkins
i
would
live
in
that
old
shell
said
barclay
rather
indignantly
and
i
am
sure
ben
would
i
apprehend
benjamin
will
have
no
voice
in
the
matter
said
squire
davenport
stiffly
he
is
only
a
boy
he
is
my
main
support
and
my
main
adviser
said
barclay
with
spirit
and
i
shall
not
take
any
step
which
is
disagreeable
to
him
kirk
looked
disappointed
but
the
squire
gave
him
an
assuring
look
as
the
widow
could
see
perhaps
you
may
change
your
mind
said
the
squire
significantly
i
am
under
the
impression
that
i
hold
a
mortgage
on
this
property
yes
sir
assented
barclay
apprehensively
for
the
sum
of
seven
hundred
dollars
if
i
am
not
mistaken
yes
sir
i
shall
have
need
of
this
money
for
other
purposes
and
will
trouble
you
to
take
it
up
i
was
to
have
three
months
notice
said
the
widow
with
a
troubled
look
i
will
give
you
three
months
notice
said
the
squire
i
do
know
where
to
raise
the
money
faltered
barclay
then
you
had
better
sell
to
my
friend
here
he
will
assume
the
mortgage
and
pay
you
three
hundred
dollars
but
that
will
be
only
a
thousand
dollars
for
the
place
a
very
fair
price
in
my
opinion
mrs
barclay
i
have
always
considered
it
worth
fifteen
hundred
dollars
said
the
widow
very
much
disturbed
a
fancy
price
my
dear
madam
quite
an
absurd
price
i
assure
you
what
do
you
say
kirk
i
quite
agree
with
you
squire
said
kirk
in
a
strong
nasal
tone
but
then
women
do
know
anything
of
business
i
know
that
you
and
your
cousin
are
trying
to
take
advantage
of
my
poverty
said
barclay
bitterly
if
you
are
a
carpenter
why
do
you
build
a
house
for
yourself
instead
of
trying
to
deprive
me
of
mine
that
my
business
said
kirk
rudely
kirk
can
not
spare
the
time
to
build
at
present
said
the
squire
then
why
does
he
hire
rooms
from
elnathan
perkins
as
you
just
recommended
to
me
they
would
suit
him
said
the
squire
curtly
he
has
set
his
mind
on
this
house
squire
davenport
said
barclay
in
a
softened
voice
i
am
sure
you
can
not
understand
what
you
ask
of
me
when
you
seek
to
take
my
home
and
turn
me
adrift
here
i
lived
with
my
poor
husband
here
my
boy
was
born
during
my
married
life
i
have
had
no
other
home
it
is
a
humble
dwelling
but
it
has
associations
and
charms
for
me
which
it
can
never
have
for
no
one
else
let
kirk
see
some
other
house
and
leave
me
undisturbed
in
mine
humph
said
the
squire
shrugging
his
shoulders
you
look
upon
the
matter
from
a
sentimental
point
of
view
that
is
unwise
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
business
you
speak
of
the
house
as
yours
in
reality
it
is
more
mine
than
yours
for
i
have
a
major
interest
in
it
think
over
my
proposal
coolly
and
you
will
see
that
you
are
unreasonable
kirk
may
be
induced
to
give
you
a
little
more
say
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
over
and
above
the
mortgage
which
as
i
said
before
he
is
willing
assume
how
does
it
happen
that
you
are
willing
to
let
the
mortgage
remain
if
he
buys
when
you
want
the
money
for
other
purposes
asked
the
widow
keenly
he
is
a
near
relative
of
my
wife
and
that
makes
the
difference
i
apprehend
well
madam
what
do
you
say
asked
kirk
briskly
i
say
this
that
i
will
keep
the
house
if
i
can
you
need
expect
that
i
will
relent
said
the
squire
hastily
i
do
not
for
i
see
there
is
no
consideration
in
your
heart
for
a
poor
widow
but
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
providence
will
raise
up
some
kind
friend
who
will
buy
the
mortgage
or
in
some
other
way
will
enable
me
to
save
my
home
you
are
acting
very
foolishly
barclay
as
you
will
realize
in
time
i
give
you
a
week
in
which
to
change
your
mind
till
then
my
friend
kirk
offer
stands
good
after
that
i
can
not
promise
if
the
property
sold
at
auction
i
should
he
surprised
if
it
did
not
fetch
more
than
the
amount
of
my
lien
upon
it
i
will
trust
in
providence
squire
davenport
providence
wo
pay
off
your
mortgage
said
kirk
with
a
coarse
laugh
barclay
did
not
answer
she
saw
that
he
was
a
man
of
coarse
fiber
and
did
not
care
to
notice
him
come
along
kirk
said
the
squire
i
apprehend
she
will
be
all
right
after
a
while
barclay
will
see
her
own
interest
when
she
comes
to
reflect
said
kirk
barclay
inclined
her
head
slowly
but
did
not
reply
when
the
two
had
left
the
house
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
gave
herself
to
painful
thoughts
she
had
known
that
squire
davenport
had
the
right
to
dispossess
her
but
had
not
supposed
he
would
do
so
as
long
as
she
paid
the
interest
regularly
in
order
to
do
this
she
and
ben
had
made
earnest
efforts
and
denied
themselves
all
but
the
barest
necessities
thus
far
she
had
succeeded
the
interest
on
seven
hundred
dollars
at
six
per
cent
had
amounted
to
dollars
and
this
was
a
large
sum
to
pay
but
thus
far
they
had
always
had
it
ready
that
squire
davenport
with
his
own
handsome
mansion
would
fix
covetous
eyes
on
her
little
home
she
had
not
anticipated
but
it
had
come
to
pass
as
to
raising
seven
hundred
dollars
to
pay
off
the
mortgage
or
induce
any
capitalist
to
furnish
it
she
feared
it
would
be
quite
impossible
she
anxiously
waited
for
ben
return
from
the
town
hall
in
order
to
consult
with
him
chapter
v
professor
harrington
entertainment
meanwhile
ben
barclay
was
enjoying
himself
at
professor
entertainment
he
was
at
the
town
hall
fifteen
minutes
before
the
time
and
secured
a
seat
very
near
the
stage
or
perhaps
it
will
be
more
correct
to
say
the
platform
he
had
scarcely
taken
his
seat
when
to
his
gratification
rose
gardiner
entered
the
hall
and
sat
down
beside
him
ben
she
said
pleasantly
so
you
came
after
all
ben
face
flushed
with
pleasure
for
rose
gardiner
was
as
we
have
said
the
prettiest
girl
in
pentonville
and
for
this
reason
as
well
as
for
her
agreeable
manners
was
an
object
of
attraction
to
the
boys
who
while
too
young
to
be
in
love
were
not
insensible
to
the
charms
of
a
pretty
face
i
may
add
that
rose
was
the
niece
of
the
rev
gardiner
the
minister
of
the
leading
church
in
the
village
rose
responded
ben
who
was
too
well
acquainted
with
the
young
lady
to
address
her
more
formally
i
am
glad
to
be
in
such
company
i
wish
i
could
return
the
compliment
answered
rose
with
a
saucy
smile
do
be
too
severe
said
ben
or
you
will
hurt
my
feelings
that
would
be
a
pity
surely
but
how
do
do
you
happen
to
get
off
this
evening
i
thought
you
spent
your
evenings
at
the
store
so
i
do
generally
but
i
was
excused
this
evening
for
a
special
reason
and
then
he
told
of
his
adventure
with
the
tramp
rose
listened
with
eager
attention
were
you
terribly
frightened
she
asked
no
answered
ben
adding
with
a
smile
even
if
i
had
been
i
should
like
to
confess
it
i
should
have
been
so
frightened
that
i
would
have
screamed
continued
the
young
lady
i
did
think
of
that
said
ben
amused
i
remember
it
next
time
oh
now
i
know
you
are
laughing
at
me
tell
me
truly
were
you
frightened
i
was
only
afraid
i
would
lose
crawford
money
the
tramp
was
stronger
than
i
and
could
have
taken
it
from
me
if
he
had
known
i
had
it
you
tricked
him
nicely
where
did
he
go
do
you
think
he
is
still
in
town
he
went
into
the
woods
i
do
think
he
is
in
the
village
he
would
be
afraid
of
being
arrested
at
that
very
moment
the
tramp
was
in
ben
kitchen
but
of
that
ben
had
no
idea
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
if
i
met
him
said
rose
you
see
i
came
alone
aunt
could
come
with
me
and
uncle
being
a
minister
does
care
for
such
things
then
i
hope
you
let
me
see
you
home
said
ben
gallantly
i
would
like
to
trouble
you
said
rose
with
a
spice
of
coquetry
it
will
take
you
out
of
your
way
i
do
mind
that
said
ben
eagerly
besides
there
wo
be
any
need
you
say
the
tramp
is
in
the
village
on
second
thoughts
i
think
it
very
likely
he
is
said
ben
if
you
really
think
so
commenced
rose
with
cunning
hesitation
i
feel
quite
sure
of
it
he
a
terrible
looking
fellow
rose
smiled
to
herself
she
meant
all
the
time
to
accept
escort
for
he
was
a
bright
attractive
boy
and
she
liked
his
society
then
perhaps
i
had
better
accept
your
offer
but
i
am
sorry
to
give
you
so
much
trouble
no
trouble
at
all
said
ben
promptly
just
then
harrington
came
forward
and
made
his
introductory
speech
for
my
first
experiment
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
when
this
was
over
i
should
like
a
pocket
handkerchief
a
young
man
on
the
front
seat
anxious
to
share
in
the
glory
of
the
coming
trick
produced
a
flaming
red
bandanna
from
his
pocket
and
tendered
it
with
outstretched
hand
you
are
very
kind
said
the
professor
but
this
will
hardly
answer
my
purpose
i
should
prefer
a
linen
handkerchief
will
some
young
lady
oblige
me
let
him
have
yours
rose
suggested
ben
rose
had
no
objection
and
it
was
passed
to
the
professor
the
young
lady
will
give
me
leave
to
do
what
i
please
with
the
handkerchief
asked
the
professor
rose
nodded
assent
then
said
the
professor
i
will
see
if
it
is
proof
against
fire
he
deliberately
unfolded
it
crushed
it
in
his
hand
and
then
held
it
in
the
flame
of
a
candle
rose
uttered
a
low
ejaculation
that
the
last
of
your
handkerchief
rose
said
ben
you
made
me
give
it
to
him
you
must
buy
me
another
said
the
young
lady
so
i
will
if
you
do
get
it
back
safe
how
can
i
i
do
know
perhaps
the
professor
does
answered
ben
really
said
the
professor
contemplating
the
handkerchief
regretfully
i
am
afraid
i
have
destroyed
the
handkerchief
i
hope
the
young
lady
will
pardon
me
he
looked
at
rose
but
she
made
no
sign
she
felt
a
little
disturbed
for
it
was
a
fine
handkerchief
given
her
by
her
aunt
i
see
the
young
lady
is
annoyed
continued
the
magician
in
that
case
i
must
try
to
repair
damages
i
made
a
little
mistake
in
supposing
the
handkerchief
to
be
noncombustible
however
perhaps
matters
are
not
so
bad
as
they
seem
he
tossed
the
handkerchief
behind
a
screen
and
moved
forward
to
a
table
on
which
was
a
neat
box
taking
a
small
key
from
his
pocket
he
unlocked
it
and
drew
forth
before
the
astonished
eyes
of
his
audience
the
handkerchief
intact
i
believe
this
is
your
handkerchief
is
it
not
he
asked
stepping
down
from
the
platform
and
handing
it
back
to
rose
yes
answered
rose
in
amazement
examining
it
carefully
and
unable
to
detect
any
injury
and
it
is
in
as
good
condition
as
when
you
gave
it
to
me
yes
sir
so
much
the
better
then
i
shall
not
be
at
the
expense
of
buying
a
new
one
young
man
have
you
any
objections
to
lending
me
your
hat
this
question
was
addressed
to
ben
no
sir
thank
you
i
will
promise
not
to
burn
it
as
i
did
the
young
handkerchief
you
are
sure
there
is
nothing
in
it
yes
sir
by
this
time
the
magician
had
reached
the
platform
i
am
sorry
to
doubt
the
young
gentleman
word
said
the
professor
but
i
will
charitably
believe
he
is
mistaken
perhaps
he
forgot
these
articles
when
he
said
it
was
empty
and
he
drew
forth
a
couple
of
potatoes
and
half
a
dozen
onions
from
the
hat
and
laid
them
on
the
table
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
from
the
audience
and
ben
looked
rather
confused
especially
when
rose
turned
to
him
and
laughing
said
you
been
robbing
crawford
i
am
afraid
ben
the
young
gentleman
evidently
uses
his
hat
for
a
proceeded
the
professor
rather
a
strange
taste
but
this
is
a
free
country
but
what
have
we
here
out
came
a
pair
of
stockings
a
napkin
and
a
necktie
very
convenient
to
carry
your
wardrobe
about
with
you
said
the
professor
though
it
is
rather
curious
taste
to
put
them
with
vegetables
but
here
is
something
else
and
the
magician
produced
a
small
kitten
who
regarded
the
audience
with
startled
eyes
and
uttered
a
timid
moan
oh
ben
let
me
have
that
pretty
kitten
said
rose
it
none
of
mine
said
ben
half
annoyed
half
amused
i
believe
there
is
nothing
more
said
the
professor
he
carried
back
the
hat
to
ben
and
gave
it
to
him
with
the
remark
young
man
you
may
call
for
your
vegetables
and
other
articles
after
the
entertainment
you
are
welcome
to
them
said
ben
thank
you
you
are
very
liberal
when
at
length
the
performance
was
over
ben
and
rose
moved
toward
the
door
as
rose
reached
the
outer
door
a
boy
about
ben
age
but
considerably
better
dressed
stepped
up
to
her
and
said
with
a
consequential
air
i
will
see
you
home
miss
gardiner
much
obliged
davenport
said
rose
but
i
have
accepted
escort
chapter
vi
two
young
rivals
tom
davenport
for
it
was
the
son
of
squire
davenport
who
had
offered
his
escort
to
rose
glanced
superciliously
at
our
hero
i
congratulate
you
on
having
secured
a
grocer
boy
as
escort
he
said
in
a
tone
of
annoyance
ben
fist
contracted
and
he
longed
to
give
the
pretentious
aristocrat
a
lesson
but
he
had
the
good
sense
to
wait
for
the
young
lady
reply
i
accept
your
congratulations
davenport
said
rose
coldly
i
have
no
desire
to
change
my
escort
tom
davenport
laughed
derisively
and
walked
away
i
like
to
box
his
ears
said
ben
reddening
he
does
deserve
your
notice
ben
said
rose
taking
his
arm
but
ben
was
not
easily
appeased
just
because
his
father
is
a
rich
man
he
resumed
he
presumes
upon
it
interrupted
rose
well
let
him
that
his
chief
claim
to
consideration
and
it
is
natural
for
him
to
make
the
most
of
it
at
any
rate
i
hope
that
ca
be
said
of
me
returned
ben
his
brow
clearing
if
i
had
nothing
but
money
to
be
proud
of
i
should
be
very
poorly
off
you
would
object
to
it
though
no
i
hope
for
mother
sake
some
day
to
be
rich
most
of
our
rich
men
were
once
poor
boys
said
rose
quietly
i
have
a
book
of
biographies
at
home
and
i
find
that
not
only
rich
men
but
men
distinguished
in
other
ways
generally
commenced
in
poverty
i
wish
you
lend
me
that
book
said
ben
sometimes
i
get
despondent
and
that
will
give
me
courage
you
shall
have
it
whenever
you
call
at
the
house
but
you
think
too
much
of
getting
money
i
do
mean
to
but
i
should
like
to
make
my
mother
comfortable
i
do
see
much
chance
of
it
while
i
remain
a
boy
as
tom
davenport
calls
me
better
be
a
grocer
boy
than
spend
your
time
in
idleness
as
tom
does
tom
thinks
it
beneath
him
to
work
if
his
father
had
been
of
the
sane
mind
when
he
was
a
boy
he
would
never
have
become
a
rich
man
was
squire
davenport
a
poor
boy
yes
so
uncle
told
me
the
other
day
when
he
was
a
boy
he
worked
on
a
farm
i
do
know
how
he
made
his
money
but
i
presume
he
laid
the
foundation
of
his
wealth
by
hard
work
so
tom
has
any
right
to
look
down
upon
those
who
are
beginning
now
as
his
father
began
they
had
by
this
time
traversed
half
the
distance
from
the
town
hall
to
the
young
lady
home
the
subject
of
conversation
was
changed
and
they
began
to
talk
about
the
evening
entertainment
at
length
they
reached
the
minister
house
wo
you
come
in
ben
asked
rose
is
it
too
late
no
uncle
always
sits
up
late
reading
and
will
be
glad
to
see
you
then
i
will
come
in
for
a
few
minutes
ben
few
minutes
extended
to
of
an
hour
when
he
came
out
the
moon
was
obscured
and
it
was
quite
dark
ben
had
not
gone
far
when
he
heard
steps
behind
him
and
presently
a
hand
was
laid
on
his
shoulder
hello
boy
said
a
rough
voice
ben
started
and
turning
suddenly
recognized
in
spite
of
the
darkness
the
tramp
who
had
attempted
to
rob
him
during
the
day
he
paused
uncertain
whether
he
was
not
going
to
be
attacked
but
the
tramp
laughed
reassuringly
do
be
afraid
boy
he
said
i
owe
you
some
money
and
here
it
is
he
pressed
into
the
hand
of
the
astonished
ben
the
dollar
which
our
hero
had
given
him
i
do
think
it
will
do
me
any
good
he
said
i
given
it
back
and
now
you
ca
say
i
robbed
you
you
are
a
strange
man
said
ben
i
not
so
bad
as
i
look
said
the
tramp
some
day
i
may
do
you
a
service
i
goin
out
of
town
and
you
hear
from
me
again
some
time
he
turned
swiftly
and
ben
lost
sight
of
him
chapter
vii
the
tramp
makes
another
call
my
readers
will
naturally
be
surprised
at
the
tramp
restitution
of
a
coin
which
though
counterfeit
he
would
probably
have
managed
to
pass
but
this
chapter
will
throw
some
light
on
his
mysterious
conduct
when
he
made
a
sudden
exit
from
barclay
house
upon
the
appearance
of
the
squire
and
his
friend
he
did
not
leave
the
premises
but
posted
himself
at
a
window
slightly
open
of
the
room
in
which
the
widow
received
her
new
visitors
he
listened
with
a
smile
to
the
squire
attempt
to
force
barclay
to
sell
her
house
he
a
sly
old
rascal
thought
the
tramp
i
put
a
spoke
in
his
wheel
when
the
squire
and
his
wife
cousin
left
the
house
the
tramp
followed
at
a
little
distance
not
far
from
the
squire
handsome
residence
kirk
left
him
and
the
tramp
then
came
boldly
forward
he
said
familiarly
squire
davenport
turned
sharply
and
as
his
eye
fell
on
the
unprepossessing
figure
he
instinctively
put
his
hand
in
the
pocket
in
which
he
kept
his
wallet
who
are
you
he
demanded
apprehensively
i
ai
a
thief
and
you
need
fear
for
your
wallet
was
the
reply
let
me
pass
fellow
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
we
see
about
that
do
you
threaten
me
asked
squire
davenport
in
alarm
not
at
all
but
i
got
some
business
with
you
some
important
business
then
call
forenoon
said
davenport
anxious
to
get
rid
of
his
acquaintance
that
wo
do
i
want
to
leave
town
tonight
that
nothing
to
me
it
may
be
said
the
tramp
significantly
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
the
husband
of
the
woman
you
called
on
the
husband
of
barclay
why
he
is
dead
ejaculated
the
squire
in
surprise
that
is
true
do
you
know
whether
he
left
any
property
no
i
believe
not
that
what
i
want
to
talk
about
you
better
see
me
there
was
significance
in
the
tone
of
the
tramp
and
squire
davenport
looked
at
him
searchingly
why
do
you
go
and
see
barclay
about
this
matter
he
asked
i
may
but
i
think
you
better
see
me
first
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
squire
gate
come
in
he
said
briefly
the
squire
led
the
way
into
a
comfortable
sitting
room
and
his
rough
visitor
followed
him
by
the
light
of
an
astral
lamp
squire
davenport
looked
at
him
did
i
ever
see
you
before
he
asked
probably
not
then
i
do
see
what
business
we
can
have
together
i
am
tired
and
wish
to
go
to
bed
i
come
to
business
at
once
then
when
john
barclay
died
in
chicago
a
wallet
was
found
in
his
pocket
and
in
that
wallet
was
a
promissory
note
for
a
thousand
dollars
signed
by
you
i
suppose
you
have
paid
that
sum
to
the
widow
squire
davenport
was
the
picture
of
dismay
he
had
meanly
ignored
the
note
with
the
intention
of
cheating
barclay
he
had
supposed
it
was
lost
yet
here
after
some
years
appeared
a
man
who
knew
of
it
as
barclay
had
been
reticent
about
his
business
affairs
he
had
never
told
his
wife
about
having
deposited
this
sum
with
squire
davenport
and
of
this
fact
the
squire
had
meanly
taken
advantage
what
proof
have
you
of
this
strange
and
improbable
story
asked
the
squire
after
a
nervous
pause
the
best
of
proof
answered
the
tramp
promptly
the
note
was
found
and
is
now
in
existence
who
holds
it
that
is
admitting
for
a
moment
the
truth
of
your
story
i
do
it
is
in
my
pocket
at
this
moment
at
this
moment
tom
davenport
opened
the
door
of
the
apartment
and
stared
in
amazement
at
his
father
singular
visitor
leave
the
room
tom
said
his
father
hastily
this
man
is
consulting
me
on
business
is
that
your
son
squire
asked
the
tramp
with
a
familiar
nod
he
quite
a
young
swell
what
business
can
my
father
have
with
such
a
cad
thought
tom
disgusted
tom
was
pleased
nevertheless
at
being
taken
for
a
young
swell
chapter
viii
squire
davenport
financial
operation
squire
davenport
was
a
thoroughly
respectable
man
in
the
estimation
of
the
community
that
such
a
man
was
capable
of
defrauding
a
poor
widow
counting
on
her
ignorance
would
have
plunged
all
his
friends
and
acquaintances
into
the
profoundest
amazement
yet
this
was
precisely
what
the
squire
had
done
barclay
who
had
prospered
beyond
his
wife
knowledge
found
himself
seven
years
before
in
possession
of
a
thousand
dollars
in
hard
cash
knowing
that
the
squire
had
a
better
knowledge
of
suitable
investments
than
he
he
went
to
him
one
day
and
asked
advice
now
the
squire
was
fond
of
money
when
he
saw
the
ample
roll
of
bank
notes
which
his
neighbor
took
from
his
wallet
he
felt
a
desire
to
possess
them
they
would
not
be
his
to
be
sure
but
merely
to
have
them
under
his
control
seemed
pleasant
so
he
said
friend
barclay
i
should
need
time
to
consider
that
question
are
you
in
a
hurry
i
should
like
to
get
the
money
out
of
my
possession
i
might
lose
it
or
have
it
stolen
besides
i
do
want
my
wife
to
discover
that
i
have
it
it
might
make
her
extravagant
perhaps
suggested
the
squire
no
i
am
not
afraid
of
that
but
i
want
some
day
to
surprise
her
by
letting
her
see
that
i
am
a
richer
man
than
she
thinks
very
judicious
then
no
one
knows
that
you
have
the
money
no
one
i
keep
my
business
to
myself
you
are
a
wise
man
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
friend
barclay
while
i
am
not
prepared
to
recommend
any
particular
investment
i
will
take
the
money
and
give
you
my
note
for
it
agreeing
to
pay
six
per
cent
interest
of
course
i
shall
invest
it
in
some
way
and
i
may
gain
or
i
may
lose
but
even
if
i
do
lose
you
will
be
safe
for
you
will
have
my
note
and
will
receive
interest
the
proposal
struck
barclay
quite
favorably
i
suppose
i
can
have
the
money
when
i
want
it
again
he
inquired
oh
certainly
i
may
require
a
month
notice
to
realize
on
securities
but
if
i
have
the
money
in
bank
i
wo
even
ask
that
then
take
the
money
squire
and
give
me
the
note
so
in
less
than
five
minutes
the
money
found
its
way
into
squire
davenport
strong
box
and
barclay
left
the
squire
presence
well
satisfied
with
his
note
of
hand
in
place
of
his
roll
of
greenbacks
nearly
two
years
passed
interest
was
paid
punctually
three
times
and
another
payment
was
all
but
due
when
the
unfortunate
creditor
died
in
chicago
then
it
was
that
a
terrible
temptation
assailed
squire
davenport
no
one
knew
of
the
trust
his
neighbor
had
reposed
in
him
not
even
his
wife
of
course
if
the
note
was
found
in
his
pocket
all
would
be
known
but
perhaps
it
would
not
be
known
in
that
case
the
thousand
dollars
and
thirty
dollars
interest
might
be
retained
without
anyone
being
the
wiser
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
squire
davenport
face
flushed
with
shame
as
the
unworthy
thought
came
to
him
but
still
he
did
not
banish
it
he
thought
the
matter
over
and
the
more
he
thought
the
more
unwilling
he
was
to
give
up
this
sum
which
all
at
once
had
become
dearer
to
him
than
all
the
rest
of
his
possessions
i
wait
to
see
whether
the
note
is
found
he
said
to
himself
of
course
if
it
is
i
will
pay
it
that
is
he
would
pay
it
if
he
were
obliged
to
do
it
poor
barclay
was
buried
in
chicago
it
would
have
been
too
expensive
to
bring
on
the
body
and
pretty
soon
it
transpired
that
he
had
left
no
property
except
the
modest
cottage
in
which
his
widow
and
son
continued
to
live
poor
barclay
everybody
pitied
her
and
lamented
her
straitened
circumstances
squire
davenport
kept
silence
and
thought
with
guilty
joy
they
have
found
the
note
i
can
keep
the
money
and
no
one
will
be
the
wiser
how
a
rich
man
could
have
been
guilty
of
such
consummate
meaness
i
will
not
undertake
to
explain
but
the
love
of
money
is
the
root
of
evil
and
squire
davenport
had
love
of
money
in
no
common
measure
five
years
passed
barclay
was
obliged
to
mortgage
her
house
to
obtain
the
means
of
living
and
the
very
man
who
supplied
her
with
the
money
was
the
very
man
whom
her
husband
had
blindly
trusted
she
little
dreamed
that
it
was
her
own
money
he
was
doling
out
to
her
in
fact
squire
davenport
himself
had
almost
forgotten
it
he
had
come
to
consider
the
thousand
dollars
and
interest
fully
and
absolutely
his
own
and
had
no
apprehension
that
his
mean
fraud
would
ever
be
discovered
like
a
thunderbolt
then
came
to
him
the
declaration
of
his
unsavory
visitor
that
the
note
was
in
existence
and
was
in
the
hands
of
a
man
who
meant
to
use
it
smitten
with
sudden
panic
he
stared
in
the
face
of
the
tramp
but
he
was
not
going
to
give
up
without
a
struggle
you
are
evidently
trying
to
impose
upon
me
he
said
mentally
bracing
up
you
wish
to
extort
money
from
me
so
i
do
said
the
tramp
quietly
ha
you
admit
it
exclaimed
the
squire
certainly
i
would
have
taken
the
trouble
to
come
here
at
great
expense
and
inconvenience
if
i
had
been
expecting
to
make
some
money
then
you
have
come
to
the
wrong
person
i
repeat
it
you
come
to
the
wrong
person
said
the
squire
straightening
his
back
and
eying
his
companion
sternly
i
begin
to
think
i
have
assented
the
visitor
ha
he
weakens
thought
squire
davenport
my
good
man
i
recommend
you
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
seek
to
earn
an
honest
living
instead
of
trying
to
levy
blackmail
on
men
of
means
an
honest
living
repeated
the
tramp
with
a
laugh
this
advice
comes
well
from
you
once
more
the
squire
felt
uncomfortable
and
apprehensive
i
do
understand
you
he
said
irritably
however
as
you
yourself
admit
you
have
come
to
the
wrong
person
just
so
said
the
visitor
rising
i
now
go
to
the
right
person
what
do
you
mean
asked
squire
davenport
in
alarm
i
mean
that
i
ought
to
have
gone
to
mrs
barclay
sit
down
sit
down
said
the
squire
nervously
you
must
do
that
why
not
demanded
the
tramp
looking
him
calmly
in
the
face
because
it
would
disturb
her
mind
and
excite
erroneous
thoughts
and
expectations
she
would
probably
be
willing
to
give
me
a
good
sum
for
bringing
it
to
her
say
the
overdue
interest
that
alone
in
five
years
and
a
half
would
amount
to
over
three
hundred
dollars
even
without
compounding
squire
davenport
groaned
in
spirit
it
was
indeed
true
he
must
pay
away
over
thirteen
hundred
dollars
and
his
loss
in
reputation
would
be
even
greater
than
his
loss
of
money
ca
we
compromise
this
thing
he
stammered
i
do
admit
the
genuineness
of
the
note
but
if
such
a
claim
were
made
it
would
seriously
annoy
me
i
am
willing
to
give
you
say
fifty
dollars
if
you
will
deliver
up
the
pretended
note
it
wo
do
squire
fifty
dollars
wo
do
i
wo
take
a
cent
less
than
two
hundred
and
that
is
only
about
half
the
interest
you
would
have
to
pay
you
speak
as
if
the
note
were
genuine
said
the
squire
uncomfortably
you
know
whether
it
is
or
not
said
the
tramp
significantly
at
any
rate
we
wo
talk
about
that
you
know
my
terms
in
the
end
squire
davenport
paid
over
two
hundred
dollars
and
received
back
the
note
which
after
a
hasty
examination
he
threw
into
the
fire
now
he
said
roughly
get
out
of
my
house
you
forger
squire
said
the
tramp
laughing
and
nodding
to
the
discomfited
squire
we
may
meet
again
some
time
if
you
come
here
again
i
will
set
the
dog
on
you
so
much
the
worse
for
the
dog
well
i
have
enjoyed
my
interview
hope
you
have
impudent
scoundrel
said
the
squire
to
himself
i
hope
he
will
swing
some
day
but
as
he
thought
over
what
had
happened
he
found
comfort
in
the
thought
that
the
secret
was
at
last
safe
the
note
was
burned
and
could
never
reappear
in
judgment
against
him
certainly
he
got
off
cheap
well
thought
the
tramp
as
he
strode
away
from
the
squire
mansion
this
has
been
a
profitable
evening
i
have
two
hundred
dollars
in
my
pocket
and
i
still
have
a
hold
on
the
rascal
if
he
had
only
examined
the
note
before
burning
it
he
might
have
made
a
discovery
chapter
ix
a
prospect
of
trouble
when
ben
returned
home
from
the
town
hall
he
discovered
at
the
first
glance
that
his
mother
was
in
trouble
are
you
disturbed
because
i
came
home
so
late
asked
ben
i
would
have
been
here
sooner
but
i
went
home
with
rose
gardiner
i
ought
to
have
remembered
that
you
might
feel
lonely
barclay
smiled
faintly
i
had
no
occasion
to
feel
lonely
she
said
i
had
three
callers
the
last
did
not
go
away
till
after
nine
i
am
glad
you
were
not
alone
mother
said
ben
thinking
some
of
his
mother
neighbors
might
have
called
i
should
rather
have
been
alone
ben
they
brought
bad
news
that
is
one
of
them
did
who
was
it
mother
who
called
on
you
the
first
one
was
the
same
man
who
took
your
money
in
the
woods
what
the
tramp
exclaimed
ben
hastily
did
he
frighten
you
a
little
at
first
but
he
did
me
no
harm
he
asked
for
some
supper
and
i
gave
it
to
him
what
bad
news
did
he
bring
none
it
was
not
he
on
the
other
hand
what
he
hinted
would
be
good
news
if
it
were
true
he
said
that
your
father
left
property
and
that
he
was
the
only
man
that
possessed
the
secret
do
you
think
this
can
be
so
said
ben
looking
at
his
mother
in
surprise
i
do
know
what
to
think
he
said
he
was
a
barkeeper
in
the
hotel
where
your
poor
father
died
and
was
about
to
say
more
when
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
and
he
hurried
away
as
if
in
fear
of
encountering
somebody
and
he
did
not
come
back
no
that
is
strange
said
ben
thoughtfully
do
you
know
mother
i
met
him
on
my
way
home
or
rather
he
came
up
behind
me
and
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
what
did
be
say
asked
barclay
eagerly
he
gave
me
back
the
bogus
dollar
he
took
from
me
saying
with
a
laugh
that
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
him
then
he
said
he
might
do
me
a
service
sometime
and
i
would
some
day
hear
from
him
ben
i
think
that
man
took
the
papers
from
the
pocket
of
your
dying
father
and
has
them
now
in
his
possession
he
promised
to
sell
me
a
secret
for
money
but
i
told
him
i
had
none
to
give
i
wish
we
could
see
him
again
but
he
said
he
should
leave
town
but
mother
what
was
the
bad
news
you
spoke
of
ben
i
am
afraid
we
are
going
to
lose
our
home
said
the
widow
the
look
of
trouble
returning
to
her
face
what
do
you
mean
mother
you
know
that
squire
davenport
has
a
mortgage
on
the
place
for
seven
hundred
dollars
he
was
here
with
a
man
named
kirk
some
connection
of
his
wife
it
seems
kirk
is
coming
to
pentonville
to
live
and
wants
this
house
he
will
have
to
want
it
mother
said
ben
stoutly
not
if
the
squire
backs
him
as
he
does
he
threatens
to
foreclose
the
mortgage
if
i
do
sell
ben
comprehended
the
situation
now
and
appreciated
its
gravity
what
does
he
offer
mother
a
thousand
dollars
only
perhaps
a
little
more
why
that
would
be
downright
robbery
not
in
the
eye
of
the
law
ben
we
are
in
the
power
of
squire
davenport
and
he
is
a
hard
man
i
would
like
to
give
him
a
piece
of
my
mind
mother
he
might
be
in
better
business
than
robbing
you
of
your
house
do
nothing
hastily
ben
there
is
only
one
thing
that
we
can
do
to
save
the
house
and
that
is
to
induce
someone
to
advance
the
money
necessary
to
take
up
the
mortgage
can
you
think
of
anybody
who
would
do
it
barclay
shook
her
head
there
is
no
one
in
pentonville
who
would
be
willing
and
has
the
money
she
said
i
have
a
rich
cousin
in
new
york
but
i
have
not
met
him
since
i
was
married
he
thought
a
great
deal
of
me
once
but
i
suppose
he
scarcely
remembers
me
now
he
lived
when
i
last
heard
of
him
on
lexington
avenue
and
his
name
is
absalom
peters
and
he
is
rich
yes
very
rich
i
believe
i
have
a
great
mind
to
ask
for
a
day
vacation
from
crawford
and
go
to
new
york
to
see
him
i
am
afraid
it
would
do
no
good
it
would
do
no
harm
except
that
it
would
cost
something
for
traveling
expenses
but
i
would
go
as
economically
as
possible
have
i
your
permission
mother
you
can
do
as
you
like
ben
i
wo
forbid
you
though
i
have
little
hope
of
its
doing
any
good
then
i
will
try
and
get
away
monday
is
saturday
and
i
ca
be
spared
at
the
store
there
is
always
more
doing
you
know
on
saturday
than
any
other
day
i
do
feel
like
giving
any
advice
ben
do
as
you
please
the
next
day
on
his
way
home
to
dinner
ben
met
his
young
rival
of
the
evening
previous
tom
davenport
how
are
you
tom
said
ben
nodding
i
want
to
speak
to
you
ben
barclay
said
the
young
aristocrat
pausing
in
his
walk
go
ahead
i
listening
said
ben
tom
was
rather
annoyed
at
the
want
of
respect
which
in
his
opinion
ben
showed
him
but
hardly
knew
how
to
express
his
objections
so
he
came
at
once
to
the
business
in
hand
you
better
not
hang
around
rose
gardiner
so
much
he
said
superciliously
what
do
you
mean
by
that
demanded
ben
quickly
you
forced
your
attentions
on
her
last
evening
at
the
town
hall
who
told
you
so
i
saw
it
for
myself
i
thought
rose
did
tell
you
so
it
must
be
disagreeable
to
her
family
to
have
a
common
grocer
boy
seen
with
her
it
seems
to
me
you
take
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
the
matter
tom
davenport
you
talk
as
if
you
were
the
guardian
of
the
young
lady
i
believe
you
wanted
to
go
home
with
her
yourself
it
would
have
been
far
more
suitable
but
you
had
made
her
promise
to
go
with
you
i
would
have
released
her
from
her
promise
at
once
if
she
had
expressed
a
wish
to
that
effect
now
i
want
to
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
i
do
want
any
of
your
advice
said
tom
loftily
i
do
want
any
advice
from
a
store
boy
i
give
it
to
you
all
the
same
you
can
make
money
by
minding
your
own
business
you
are
impudent
said
tom
flushing
with
anger
i
got
something
more
to
tell
you
you
be
out
on
the
sidewalk
before
three
months
are
over
father
is
going
to
foreclose
the
mortgage
on
your
house
that
remains
to
be
seen
said
ben
but
his
heart
sank
within
him
as
he
realized
that
the
words
would
probably
prove
true
chapter
x
ben
goes
to
new
york
pentonville
was
miles
distant
from
new
york
and
the
fare
was
a
dollar
but
an
excursion
ticket
carrying
a
passenger
both
ways
was
only
a
dollar
and
a
half
ben
calculated
that
his
extra
expenses
including
dinner
might
amount
to
fifty
cents
thus
making
the
cost
of
the
trip
two
dollars
this
sum
small
as
it
was
appeared
large
both
to
ben
and
his
mother
some
doubts
about
the
expediency
of
the
journey
suggested
themselves
to
barclay
do
you
think
you
had
better
go
ben
she
said
doubtfully
two
dollars
would
buy
you
some
new
stockings
and
handkerchiefs
i
will
do
without
them
mother
something
has
got
to
be
done
or
we
shall
be
turned
into
the
street
when
three
months
are
up
squire
davenport
is
a
very
selfish
man
and
he
will
care
nothing
for
our
comfort
or
convenience
that
is
true
said
the
widow
with
a
sigh
if
i
thought
your
going
to
new
york
would
do
any
good
i
would
not
grudge
you
the
money
something
will
turn
up
or
i
will
turn
up
something
said
ben
confidently
when
he
asked
crawford
for
a
day
off
the
latter
responded
yes
ben
i
think
i
can
spare
you
as
monday
is
not
a
very
busy
day
would
you
be
willing
to
do
an
errand
for
me
certainly
crawford
with
pleasure
i
need
a
new
supply
of
prints
go
to
stackpole
rogers
no
white
street
and
select
me
some
attractive
patterns
i
shall
rely
upon
your
taste
thank
you
sir
said
ben
gratified
by
the
compliment
he
received
instructions
as
to
price
and
quantity
which
he
carefully
noted
down
as
it
will
save
me
a
journey
not
to
speak
of
my
time
i
am
willing
to
pay
your
fare
one
way
thank
you
sir
you
are
very
kind
crawford
took
from
the
money
drawer
a
dollar
and
handed
it
to
ben
but
i
buy
an
excursion
ticket
so
that
my
fare
each
way
will
be
but
cents
never
mind
the
balance
will
go
toward
your
dinner
there
mother
what
do
you
say
now
said
ben
on
saturday
night
crawford
is
going
to
pay
half
my
expenses
and
i
am
going
to
buy
some
goods
for
him
i
am
glad
he
reposes
so
much
confidence
in
you
ben
i
hope
you
wo
lose
his
money
oh
i
do
carry
any
he
buys
on
thirty
days
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
select
the
goods
perhaps
it
is
for
the
best
that
you
go
after
all
said
barclay
at
any
rate
i
hope
so
at
seven
on
monday
morning
ben
stood
on
the
platform
of
the
pentonville
station
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
train
where
are
you
going
said
a
voice
ben
turning
saw
that
it
was
tom
davenport
who
had
spoken
i
am
going
to
new
york
he
answered
briefly
has
crawford
discharged
you
why
do
you
ask
would
you
like
to
apply
for
the
position
asked
ben
coolly
do
you
think
i
would
condescend
to
be
a
grocer
boy
returned
tom
disdainfully
i
do
know
if
i
go
into
business
it
will
be
as
a
merchant
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
you
did
say
what
you
were
going
to
new
york
for
i
have
no
objection
to
tell
you
as
you
are
anxious
to
know
i
am
going
to
the
city
to
buy
goods
tom
looked
not
only
amazed
but
incredulous
that
a
likely
story
said
he
after
a
pause
it
is
a
true
story
do
you
mean
to
say
crawford
trusts
you
buy
goods
for
him
so
it
seems
he
must
be
getting
suppose
you
call
and
give
him
that
gratifying
piece
of
information
just
then
the
train
came
thundering
up
and
ben
jumped
aboard
tom
davenport
looked
after
him
with
a
puzzled
glance
i
wonder
whether
that
boy
tells
the
truth
he
said
to
himself
he
thinks
too
much
of
himself
considering
what
he
is
it
never
occurred
to
tom
that
the
remark
would
apply
even
better
to
him
than
the
boy
he
was
criticising
as
a
rule
we
are
the
last
to
recognize
our
own
faults
however
quick
we
may
be
to
see
the
faults
of
others
two
hours
later
ben
stood
in
front
of
the
large
jobbing
house
of
stackpole
rogers
in
white
street
he
ascended
the
staircase
to
the
second
floor
which
was
very
spacious
and
filled
with
goods
in
great
variety
where
is
the
department
of
prints
he
inquired
of
a
young
man
near
the
door
he
was
speedily
directed
and
went
over
at
once
he
showed
the
salesman
in
charge
a
letter
from
crawford
authorizing
him
to
select
a
certain
amount
of
goods
you
are
rather
a
young
buyer
said
the
salesman
smiling
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
served
in
that
way
said
ben
modestly
but
i
know
pretty
well
what
crawford
wants
half
an
hour
was
consumed
in
making
his
selections
you
have
good
taste
said
the
salesman
judging
from
your
selections
thank
you
if
you
ever
come
to
the
city
to
look
for
work
come
here
and
i
will
introduce
you
to
the
firm
thank
you
how
soon
can
you
ship
the
goods
i
am
afraid
not
as
we
are
very
busy
early
next
week
we
will
send
them
his
business
concluded
ben
left
the
store
and
walked
up
to
broadway
the
crowded
thoroughfare
had
much
to
interest
him
he
was
looking
at
a
window
when
someone
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
it
was
a
young
man
foppishly
attired
who
was
smiling
graciously
upon
him
why
gus
andre
he
said
when
did
you
come
to
town
and
how
did
you
leave
all
the
folks
in
bridgeport
you
have
made
a
mistake
said
ben
is
your
name
gus
andre
no
it
is
ben
barclay
from
pentonville
i
really
beg
your
pardon
you
look
surprisingly
like
my
friend
gussie
five
minutes
later
there
was
another
tap
on
our
hero
shoulder
as
he
was
looking
into
another
window
and
another
nicely
dressed
young
man
said
heartily
why
ben
my
boy
when
did
you
come
to
town
this
morning
answered
ben
you
seem
to
know
me
but
i
remember
you
are
you
not
ben
barclay
of
pentonville
yes
but
do
you
remember
jim
fisher
who
passed
part
of
the
summer
two
years
since
in
your
village
where
were
you
staying
asked
ben
it
was
the
other
turn
to
looked
confused
at
the
smiths
he
answered
at
random
at
roxana
smith
suggested
ben
yes
yes
said
the
other
eagerly
she
is
my
aunt
is
she
asked
ben
with
a
smile
of
amusement
for
he
had
by
this
time
made
up
his
mind
as
to
the
character
of
his
new
friend
she
must
be
proud
of
her
stylish
nephew
smith
is
a
poor
widow
and
takes
in
washing
it
some
other
smith
said
the
young
man
discomfited
she
is
the
only
one
by
that
name
in
pentonville
jim
fisher
as
he
called
himself
turned
upon
his
heel
and
left
ben
without
a
word
it
was
clear
that
nothing
could
be
made
out
of
him
ben
walked
all
the
way
up
broadway
as
far
as
street
into
which
he
turned
and
walked
eastward
until
he
reached
gramercy
park
opposite
which
lexington
avenue
starts
in
due
time
he
reached
the
house
of
absalom
peters
and
ascending
the
steps
he
rang
the
bell
is
peters
in
he
asked
of
the
servant
who
answered
the
bell
no
will
he
be
in
soon
i
guess
not
he
sailed
for
europe
last
week
ben
heart
sank
within
him
he
had
hoped
much
from
peters
before
whom
he
meant
to
lay
all
the
facts
of
his
mother
situation
now
that
hope
was
crushed
he
turned
and
slowly
descended
the
steps
there
goes
our
last
chance
of
saving
the
house
he
said
to
himself
sadly
chapter
xi
the
madison
avenue
stage
ben
was
naturally
hopeful
but
he
had
counted
more
than
he
was
aware
on
the
chance
of
obtaining
assistance
from
absalom
peters
toward
paying
off
his
mother
mortgage
as
peters
was
in
europe
nothing
could
be
done
and
them
seemed
absolutely
no
one
else
to
apply
to
they
had
friends
of
course
and
warm
ones
in
pentonville
but
none
that
were
able
to
help
them
i
suppose
we
must
make
up
our
minds
to
lose
the
house
thought
ben
squire
davenport
is
selfish
and
grasping
and
there
is
little
chance
of
turning
him
he
walked
westward
till
he
reached
madison
avenue
a
stage
approached
being
bound
downtown
and
feeling
tired
he
got
in
the
fare
was
but
five
cents
and
he
was
willing
to
pay
it
some
half
dozen
other
passengers
beside
himself
were
in
the
stage
opposite
ben
sat
a
handsomely
dressed
somewhat
portly
lady
of
middle
age
with
a
kindly
expression
next
her
sat
a
young
man
attired
fashionably
who
had
the
appearance
of
belonging
to
a
family
of
position
there
were
besides
an
elderly
man
of
clerical
appearance
a
nurse
with
a
small
child
a
business
man
intent
upon
the
financial
column
of
a
leading
paper
and
a
schoolboy
ben
regarded
his
with
interest
in
pentonville
he
seldom
saw
a
new
face
here
all
were
new
our
young
hero
was
though
be
did
not
know
it
an
embryo
student
of
human
nature
he
liked
to
observe
men
and
women
of
different
classes
and
speculate
upon
their
probable
position
and
traits
it
so
happened
that
his
special
attention
was
attracted
to
the
young
man
i
suppose
he
belongs
to
a
rich
family
and
has
plenty
of
money
thought
ben
it
must
be
pleasant
to
be
born
with
a
gold
spoon
in
your
mouth
and
know
that
you
are
provided
for
life
if
ben
had
been
wiser
he
would
have
judged
differently
to
be
born
to
wealth
removes
all
the
incentives
to
action
and
checks
the
spirit
of
enterprise
a
boy
or
man
who
finds
himself
gradually
rising
in
the
world
through
his
own
exertions
experiences
a
satisfaction
unknown
to
one
whose
fortune
is
however
in
ben
present
strait
it
is
no
wonder
he
regarded
with
envy
the
supposed
young
man
of
fortune
our
hero
was
destined
to
be
strangely
surprised
his
eyes
were
unusually
keen
and
enabled
him
after
a
while
to
observe
some
rather
remarkable
movements
on
the
part
of
the
young
man
though
his
eyes
were
looking
elsewhere
ben
could
see
that
his
right
hand
was
stealthily
insinuating
itself
into
the
pocket
of
the
lady
at
his
side
is
it
possible
that
he
is
a
pickpocket
thought
ben
in
amazement
so
nicely
dressed
as
he
is
too
it
did
not
occur
to
ben
that
he
dressed
well
the
better
to
avert
suspicion
from
his
real
character
besides
a
man
who
lives
at
other
people
expense
can
afford
to
dress
well
what
shall
i
do
thought
ben
disturbed
in
mind
ought
i
not
to
warn
the
lady
that
she
is
in
danger
of
losing
her
money
while
he
was
hesitating
the
deed
was
accomplished
a
pearl
portemonnaie
was
adroitly
drawn
from
the
lady
pocket
and
transferred
to
that
of
the
young
man
it
was
done
with
incredible
swiftness
but
ben
sharp
eyes
saw
it
the
young
man
yawned
and
turning
away
from
the
lady
appeared
to
be
looking
out
of
a
window
at
the
head
of
the
coach
why
there
is
jack
osborne
he
said
half
audibly
and
rising
pulled
the
strap
for
the
driver
to
stop
the
stage
then
was
the
critical
moment
for
ben
was
he
to
allow
the
thief
to
escape
with
the
money
ben
hated
to
get
into
a
disturbance
but
he
felt
that
it
would
be
wrong
and
cowardly
to
be
silent
before
you
get
out
he
said
hand
that
lady
her
pocketbook
the
face
of
the
pickpocket
changed
and
he
darted
a
malignant
glance
at
ben
what
do
you
mean
you
young
scoundrel
he
said
you
have
taken
that
lady
pocketbook
persisted
ben
do
you
mean
to
insult
me
i
saw
you
do
it
with
a
half
exclamation
of
anger
the
young
man
darted
to
the
door
but
he
was
brought
to
a
standstill
by
the
business
man
who
placed
himself
in
his
way
not
so
fast
young
man
he
said
resolutely
out
of
the
way
exclaimed
the
thief
in
a
rage
it
all
a
base
lie
i
never
was
so
insulted
in
my
life
do
you
miss
your
pocketbook
madam
asked
the
gentleman
turning
to
the
lady
who
had
been
robbed
yes
she
answered
it
was
in
the
pocket
next
to
this
man
the
thief
seeing
there
was
no
hope
of
retaining
his
booty
drew
it
from
his
pocket
and
flung
it
into
the
lady
lap
now
may
i
go
he
said
there
was
no
policeman
in
sight
and
at
a
nod
from
the
lady
the
pickpocket
was
allowed
to
leave
the
stage
you
ought
to
have
had
him
arrested
he
is
a
dangerous
character
said
the
gentleman
who
had
barred
his
progress
it
would
have
been
inconvenient
for
me
to
appear
against
him
said
the
lady
i
am
willing
to
let
him
go
well
there
is
one
comfort
if
he
keeps
on
he
will
be
hauled
up
sooner
or
later
remarked
the
gentleman
would
your
loss
have
been
a
heavy
one
he
inquired
i
had
quite
a
large
sum
in
my
pocketbook
over
two
hundred
dollars
but
for
my
young
friend
opposite
she
said
nodding
kindly
at
ben
i
should
have
lost
it
with
very
small
chance
of
recovery
i
am
glad
to
have
done
you
a
service
madam
said
ben
politely
i
know
it
is
rather
imprudent
to
carry
so
large
sum
about
with
me
continued
the
lady
but
i
have
a
payment
to
make
to
a
carpenter
who
has
done
work
in
my
house
and
i
thought
he
might
not
find
it
convenient
use
a
check
a
lady
is
in
more
danger
than
a
gentleman
observed
the
business
man
as
she
can
not
so
well
hide
away
her
pocketbook
you
will
need
to
be
careful
as
you
walk
along
the
street
i
think
it
will
be
best
to
have
a
neighbor
whom
i
can
trust
said
the
lady
would
you
mind
taking
this
seat
at
my
side
she
continued
addressing
ben
i
will
change
with
pleasure
said
our
hero
taking
the
seat
recently
vacated
by
the
pickpocket
you
have
sharp
eyes
my
young
friend
said
his
new
acquaintance
my
eyes
are
pretty
good
said
ben
with
a
smile
they
have
done
me
good
service
may
i
know
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
such
timely
help
my
name
is
benjamin
barclay
do
you
live
in
the
city
no
madam
i
live
in
pentonville
about
thirty
miles
from
new
york
i
have
heard
of
the
place
are
you
proposing
to
live
here
no
madam
i
came
in
on
a
little
business
of
my
own
and
also
to
select
some
goods
for
a
country
store
in
which
i
am
employed
you
are
rather
young
for
such
a
commission
i
know
the
sort
of
goods
crawford
sells
so
it
was
not
very
difficult
to
make
the
selection
at
what
time
do
you
go
back
by
the
four
train
have
you
anything
to
do
meanwhile
no
madam
answered
ben
a
little
surprised
then
i
should
like
to
have
you
accompany
me
to
the
place
where
i
am
to
settle
my
bill
i
feel
rather
timid
after
my
adventure
with
our
late
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
oblige
you
madam
said
ben
politely
he
had
just
heard
a
public
clock
strike
one
and
he
knew
therefore
that
he
would
have
plenty
of
time
chapter
xii
ben
luck
we
will
get
out
here
said
hamilton
they
had
reached
the
corner
of
fourth
street
and
broadway
ben
pulled
the
strap
and
with
his
new
friend
left
the
stage
he
offered
his
hand
politely
to
assist
the
lady
in
descending
he
is
a
little
gentleman
thought
hamilton
who
was
much
pleased
with
our
hero
they
turned
from
broadway
eastward
and
presently
crossed
the
bowery
also
not
far
to
the
east
of
the
last
avenue
they
came
to
a
carpenter
shop
plank
a
mechanic
looked
up
in
surprise
when
hamilton
entered
the
shop
you
did
expect
a
call
from
me
said
the
lady
pleasantly
no
fashionable
ladies
do
often
find
their
way
over
here
then
do
look
upon
me
as
a
fashionable
lady
i
like
to
attend
to
my
business
myself
and
have
brought
you
the
money
for
your
bill
thank
you
you
never
made
me
wait
but
i
am
sorry
you
had
the
trouble
to
come
to
my
shop
i
would
have
called
at
your
house
if
you
had
sent
me
a
postal
my
time
was
not
so
valuable
as
yours
plank
i
must
tell
you
however
that
you
came
near
not
getting
your
money
this
morning
another
person
undertook
to
collect
your
bill
who
was
it
demanded
the
carpenter
indignantly
if
there
anybody
playing
such
tricks
on
me
i
will
have
him
up
before
the
courts
it
was
no
acquaintance
of
yours
the
person
in
question
had
no
spite
against
you
and
you
would
only
have
suffered
a
little
delay
then
hamilton
explained
how
a
pickpocket
had
undertaken
to
relieve
her
of
her
wallet
and
would
have
succeeded
but
for
her
young
companion
oh
they
mighty
sharp
i
can
tell
you
said
the
carpenter
i
never
lost
anything
because
i
do
look
as
if
i
had
anything
worth
stealing
but
if
one
of
those
rascals
made
up
his
mind
to
rob
me
ten
to
one
he
do
it
plank
receipted
his
bill
and
hamilton
paid
him
a
hundred
and
dollars
and
fifty
cents
ben
could
not
help
envying
him
as
he
saw
the
roll
of
bills
transferred
to
him
i
hope
the
work
was
done
satisfactory
said
plank
perfect
grammar
could
not
be
expected
of
a
man
who
from
the
age
of
twelve
had
been
forced
to
earn
his
own
living
quite
so
plank
said
the
lady
graciously
i
shall
send
for
you
when
i
have
any
more
work
to
be
done
there
was
no
more
business
to
attend
to
and
hamilton
led
the
way
out
accompanied
by
ben
i
will
trouble
you
to
see
me
as
far
as
broadway
said
the
lady
i
am
not
used
to
this
neighborhood
and
prefer
to
have
an
escort
i
did
think
this
morning
said
ben
to
himself
that
a
rich
lady
would
select
me
as
her
escort
on
the
whole
he
liked
it
it
gave
him
a
feeling
of
importance
and
a
sense
of
responsibility
which
a
manly
boy
always
likes
i
shall
be
glad
to
stay
with
you
as
long
as
you
like
said
ben
thank
you
benjamin
or
shall
i
say
ben
i
wish
you
would
i
hardly
know
myself
when
i
am
called
benjamin
as
we
are
walking
alone
suppose
you
tell
me
something
of
yourself
i
only
know
your
name
and
that
you
live
in
pentonville
what
relations
have
you
a
mother
only
my
father
is
dead
and
you
help
take
care
of
your
mother
i
suppose
yes
father
left
us
nothing
except
the
house
we
live
in
or
at
least
we
could
get
track
of
no
other
property
he
died
in
chicago
suddenly
i
hope
you
are
getting
along
comfortably
you
and
your
mother
said
hamilton
kindly
we
have
our
troubles
answered
ben
we
are
in
danger
of
having
our
house
taken
from
us
how
is
that
a
rich
man
in
our
village
squire
davenport
has
a
mortgage
of
seven
hundred
dollars
upon
it
he
wants
the
house
for
a
relative
of
his
wife
and
threatens
to
foreclose
at
the
end
of
three
months
the
house
must
be
worth
a
good
deal
more
than
the
mortgage
it
is
worth
twice
as
much
but
if
it
is
put
up
at
auction
i
doubt
if
it
will
fetch
over
a
thousand
dollars
this
would
leave
your
mother
but
three
hundred
yes
answered
ben
despondingly
have
you
thought
of
any
way
of
raising
the
money
yes
i
came
up
to
the
city
to
see
a
cousin
of
mother
a
absalom
peters
who
lives
on
lexington
avenue
and
i
had
just
come
from
there
when
i
got
into
the
stage
with
you
wo
he
help
you
perhaps
he
might
if
he
was
in
the
city
though
mother
has
seen
nothing
of
him
for
twenty
years
but
unfortunately
he
just
sailed
for
europe
that
is
indeed
a
pity
i
suppose
you
have
much
hope
now
unless
peters
comes
back
he
is
the
only
one
we
can
think
of
to
call
upon
what
sort
of
a
man
is
this
squire
davenport
he
is
a
very
selfish
man
who
thinks
only
of
his
own
interests
we
felt
safe
because
we
did
not
suppose
he
would
have
any
use
for
a
small
house
like
ours
but
night
before
last
he
called
on
mother
with
the
man
he
wants
it
for
he
can
not
foreclose
just
yet
can
he
asked
hamilton
no
we
have
three
months
to
look
around
three
months
is
a
long
time
said
the
lady
cheerfully
a
good
deal
can
happen
in
three
months
do
the
best
you
can
and
keep
up
hope
i
shall
try
to
do
so
you
have
reason
to
do
so
you
may
not
save
your
house
but
you
have
probably
a
good
many
years
before
you
and
plenty
of
good
fortune
may
be
in
store
for
you
the
cheerful
tone
in
which
the
lady
spoke
some
how
made
ben
hopeful
and
sanguine
at
any
rate
for
the
time
being
in
this
country
the
fact
that
you
are
a
poor
boy
will
not
stand
in
the
way
of
your
success
the
most
eminent
men
of
the
day
in
all
branches
of
business
and
in
all
professions
were
once
poor
boys
i
dare
say
looking
at
me
you
do
suppose
i
ever
knew
anything
of
poverty
no
said
ben
yet
i
was
the
daughter
of
a
bankrupt
farmer
and
my
husband
was
clerk
in
a
country
store
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
how
he
came
to
the
city
and
prospered
leaving
me
at
his
death
rich
beyond
my
needs
yet
that
is
his
history
and
mine
does
it
encourage
you
yes
it
does
answered
ben
earnestly
it
is
for
that
reason
perhaps
that
i
take
an
interest
in
country
boys
who
are
placed
as
my
husband
once
was
continued
hamilton
but
here
we
are
at
broadway
it
only
remains
to
express
my
acknowledgment
of
your
timely
assistance
you
are
quite
welcome
said
ben
i
am
sure
of
that
but
i
am
none
the
less
indebted
do
me
the
favor
to
accept
this
she
opened
her
portemonnaie
and
taking
from
it
a
banknote
handed
it
to
ben
in
surprise
he
looked
at
it
and
saw
that
it
was
a
bill
did
you
know
this
was
a
bill
he
asked
in
amazement
certainly
answered
the
lady
with
a
smile
it
is
less
than
ten
per
cent
of
the
amount
i
would
have
lost
but
for
you
i
hope
it
will
be
of
service
to
you
i
feel
rich
with
it
answered
ben
how
can
i
thank
you
mrs
hamilton
call
on
me
at
no
madison
avenue
and
do
it
in
person
when
you
next
come
to
the
city
said
the
lady
smiling
now
if
you
will
kindly
call
that
stage
i
will
bid
you
for
the
present
ben
complied
with
her
request
and
joyfully
resumed
his
walk
down
broadway
chapter
xiii
a
startling
event
though
ben
had
failed
in
the
main
object
of
his
expedition
he
returned
to
pentonville
in
excellent
spirits
he
felt
that
he
had
been
a
favorite
of
fortune
and
with
good
reason
in
one
day
he
had
acquired
a
sum
equal
to
five
weeks
wages
added
to
the
dollar
crawford
had
contributed
toward
his
expenses
he
had
been
paid
dollars
while
he
had
spent
a
little
less
than
two
it
is
not
every
country
boy
who
goes
up
to
the
great
city
who
returns
with
an
equal
harvest
if
squire
davenport
had
not
threatened
to
foreclose
the
mortgage
he
would
have
felt
justified
in
buying
a
present
for
his
mother
as
it
was
he
feared
they
would
have
need
of
all
the
money
that
came
in
to
meet
contingencies
the
train
reached
pentonville
at
five
and
about
the
usual
time
ben
opened
the
gate
and
walked
up
to
the
front
door
of
his
modest
home
he
looked
so
bright
and
cheerful
when
he
entered
her
presence
that
barclay
thought
be
must
have
found
and
been
kindly
received
by
the
cousin
whom
he
had
gone
up
to
seek
did
you
see
mr
peters
she
asked
anxiously
no
mother
he
is
in
europe
a
shadow
came
over
the
mother
face
it
was
like
taking
from
her
her
last
hope
i
was
afraid
you
would
not
be
repaid
for
going
up
to
the
city
she
said
i
made
a
pretty
good
day
work
of
it
nevertheless
mother
what
do
you
say
to
this
and
he
opened
his
wallet
and
showed
her
a
roll
of
bills
is
that
crawford
money
she
asked
no
mother
it
is
mine
or
rather
it
is
yours
for
i
give
it
to
you
did
you
find
a
pocketbook
ben
if
so
the
owner
may
turn
up
mother
the
money
is
mine
fairly
mine
for
it
was
given
me
in
return
for
a
service
i
rendered
a
lady
in
new
york
what
service
could
you
have
possibly
rendered
ben
that
merited
such
liberal
payment
asked
his
mother
in
surprise
upon
this
ben
explained
and
barclay
listened
to
his
story
with
wonder
so
you
see
mother
i
did
well
to
go
to
the
city
said
ben
in
conclusion
it
has
turned
out
so
and
i
am
thankful
for
your
good
fortune
but
i
should
have
been
better
pleased
if
you
had
seen
peters
and
found
him
willing
to
help
us
about
the
mortgage
so
would
i
mother
but
this
money
is
worth
having
when
supper
is
over
i
will
go
to
the
store
to
help
out
crawford
and
report
my
purchase
of
goods
you
know
the
most
of
our
trade
is
in
the
evening
after
ben
had
gone
barclay
felt
her
spirits
return
as
she
thought
of
the
large
addition
to
their
little
stock
of
money
one
piece
of
good
fortune
may
be
followed
by
another
she
thought
peters
may
return
from
europe
in
time
to
help
us
at
any
rate
we
have
nearly
three
months
to
look
about
us
and
god
may
send
us
help
when
the
tea
dishes
were
washed
and
put
away
barclay
sat
down
to
mend
a
pair
of
ben
socks
for
in
that
household
it
was
necessary
to
make
clothing
last
as
long
as
possible
when
she
was
aroused
from
her
work
by
a
ringing
at
the
bell
she
opened
the
door
to
admit
squire
davenport
she
said
rather
coldly
for
she
could
not
feel
friendly
to
a
man
who
was
conspiring
to
deprive
her
of
her
modest
home
and
turn
her
out
upon
the
sidewalk
widow
said
the
squire
will
you
walk
in
asked
barclay
not
over
cordially
thank
you
i
will
step
in
for
five
minutes
i
called
to
see
if
you
had
thought
better
of
my
proposal
the
other
evening
your
proposal
was
to
take
my
house
from
me
said
barclay
how
can
you
suppose
i
would
think
better
of
that
you
forget
that
the
house
is
more
mine
than
yours
already
barclay
the
sum
i
have
advanced
on
mortgage
is
of
the
value
of
the
property
i
dispute
that
sir
let
it
pass
said
the
squire
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
call
it
if
you
will
even
then
the
property
is
more
mine
than
yours
women
do
understand
business
or
you
would
see
matters
in
a
different
light
i
am
a
woman
it
is
true
but
i
understand
very
well
that
you
wish
to
take
advantage
of
me
said
the
widow
not
without
excusable
bitterness
my
good
lady
you
forget
that
i
am
ready
to
cancel
the
mortgage
and
pay
you
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
for
the
house
now
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
is
a
handsome
sum
a
very
handsome
sum
you
could
put
it
in
the
savings
bank
and
it
would
yield
you
quite
a
comfortable
income
twenty
dollars
more
or
less
said
barclay
is
that
what
you
call
a
comfortable
income
how
long
do
you
think
it
would
keep
us
alive
added
of
course
to
your
son
wages
ben
is
now
able
to
earn
good
wages
he
earns
four
dollars
a
week
and
that
is
our
main
dependence
i
congratulate
you
i
did
suppose
crawford
paid
such
high
wages
ben
earns
every
cent
of
it
very
possibly
by
the
way
what
is
this
that
tom
was
telling
me
about
ben
being
sent
to
new
york
to
buy
goods
for
the
store
it
is
true
if
that
is
what
you
mean
bless
my
soul
it
is
very
strange
of
crawford
and
i
may
add
not
very
judicious
i
suppose
crawford
is
the
best
judge
of
that
sir
even
if
the
boy
were
competent
which
is
not
for
a
moment
to
be
thought
of
it
is
calculated
to
foster
his
ben
is
not
said
barclay
ready
to
resent
any
slur
upon
her
boy
he
has
excellent
business
capacity
and
if
he
were
older
i
should
not
need
to
ask
favors
of
anyone
you
are
a
mother
and
naturally
set
an
exaggerated
estimate
upon
your
son
ability
which
i
presume
is
respectable
but
probably
not
more
however
let
that
pass
i
did
not
call
to
discuss
ben
but
to
inquire
whether
you
had
not
thought
better
of
the
matter
we
discussed
the
other
evening
i
never
shall
squire
davenport
when
the
time
comes
you
can
foreclose
if
you
like
but
it
will
never
be
done
with
my
consent
ahem
your
consent
will
not
be
required
and
let
me
tell
you
squire
davenport
if
you
do
this
wicked
thing
it
wo
benefit
you
in
the
end
squire
davenport
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
am
not
at
all
surprised
to
find
you
so
unreasonable
barclay
he
said
it
the
way
with
women
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
come
to
look
upon
the
matter
in
a
different
light
but
i
can
not
sacrifice
my
own
interests
in
any
event
the
law
is
on
my
side
the
law
may
be
on
your
side
but
the
law
upholds
a
great
deal
that
is
oppressive
and
cruel
a
curious
set
of
laws
we
should
have
if
women
made
them
said
the
squire
they
would
not
bear
so
heavily
upon
the
poor
as
they
do
now
well
i
wo
stop
to
discuss
the
matter
if
you
come
to
entertain
different
views
about
the
house
send
word
by
ben
and
we
will
arrange
the
details
without
delay
kirk
is
anxious
to
move
his
family
as
soon
as
possible
and
would
like
to
secure
the
house
at
once
he
will
have
to
wait
three
months
at
least
said
barclay
coldly
for
that
time
i
believe
the
law
protects
me
you
are
right
there
but
at
the
end
of
that
tine
you
can
not
expect
as
liberal
terms
as
we
are
now
prepared
to
offer
you
liberal
repeated
the
widow
in
a
meaning
tone
so
i
regard
it
said
the
squire
stiffly
an
hour
later
barclay
reflections
were
broken
in
upon
by
the
ominous
clang
of
the
engine
bell
this
is
a
sound
which
always
excites
alarm
in
a
country
village
where
the
fire
she
asked
anxiously
of
a
boy
who
was
running
by
the
house
it
crawford
store
was
the
startling
reply
it
blazin
up
like
anything
guess
it
have
to
go
i
hope
ben
keep
out
of
danger
thought
barclay
as
she
hurriedly
took
her
shawl
and
bonnet
and
started
for
the
scene
of
excitement
chapter
xiv
ben
shows
himself
a
hero
a
fire
in
a
country
village
particularly
where
the
building
is
a
prominent
one
is
sure
to
attract
a
large
part
of
the
resident
population
men
women
and
children
as
well
as
the
hook
and
ladder
company
hurried
to
the
scene
of
conflagration
everybody
felt
a
personal
interest
in
crawford
it
was
the
great
emporium
which
provided
all
the
families
in
the
village
with
articles
of
prime
and
secondary
necessity
if
paris
can
be
called
france
then
might
be
called
pentonville
crawford
on
fire
exclaimed
old
captain
manson
bless
my
soul
it
can
not
be
true
where
my
cane
you
do
mean
to
say
you
goin
to
the
fire
father
asked
his
widowed
daughter
in
surprise
for
the
captain
had
bowed
beneath
the
weight
of
winters
and
rarely
left
the
domestic
hearth
do
you
think
i
stay
at
home
when
crawford
was
returned
the
captain
but
remember
father
you
ai
so
young
as
you
used
to
be
you
might
catch
your
death
of
cold
what
at
a
fire
exclaimed
the
old
man
laughing
at
his
own
joke
you
know
what
i
mean
it
dreadfully
imprudent
why
i
would
go
myself
should
think
you
would
at
your
time
of
life
retorted
her
father
chuckling
so
the
old
man
emerged
into
the
street
and
hurried
as
fast
as
his
unsteady
limbs
would
allow
to
the
fire
how
did
it
catch
the
reader
will
naturally
ask
the
young
man
who
was
the
only
other
salesman
besides
ben
and
the
proprietor
had
gone
down
cellar
smoking
a
cigar
in
one
corner
was
a
heap

noticed
it
with
prompt
measures
the
incipient
fire
might
have
been
extinguished
but
he
went
up
stairs
with
the
kerosene
which
he
had
drawn
for
old
watts
leaving
behind
him
the
seeds
of
destruction
soon
the
flames
arising
caught
the
wooden
flooring
of
the
upper
store
the
smell
of
the
smoke
notified
crawford
and
his
clerks
of
the
impending
disaster
when
the
door
communicating
with
the
basement
was
opened
a
stifling
smoke
issued
forth
and
the
crackling
of
the
fire
was
heard
run
ben
give
the
alarm
called
crawford
pale
with
dismay
and
apprehension
it
was
no
time
then
to
inquire
how
the
fire
caught
there
was
only
time
to
save
as
much
of
the
stock
as
possible
since
it
was
clear
that
the
fire
had
gained
too
great
a
headway
to
be
put
out
ben
lost
no
time
and
in
less
than
ten
minutes
the
engine
which
fortunately
was
housed
only
ten
rods
away
was
on
the
ground
though
it
was
impossible
to
save
the
store
the
fire
might
be
prevented
from
spreading
a
band
of
earnest
workers
aided
crawford
in
saving
his
stock
a
large
part
of
course
must
be
sacrificed
but
perhaps
a
quarter
was
saved
all
at
once
a
terrified
whisper
spread
from
one
to
another
morton
children
where
are
they
they
must
be
in
the
third
story
a
poor
woman
morton
had
been
allowed
with
her
two
children
to
enjoy
temporarily
two
rooms
in
the
third
story
she
had
gone
to
a
farmer
two
miles
away
to
do
some
work
and
her
children
seven
and
nine
years
of
age
had
remained
at
home
they
seemed
doomed
to
certain
death
but
even
as
the
inquiry
went
from
lip
to
lip
the
children
appeared
they
had
clambered
out
of
a
third
story
window
upon
the
sloping
roof
of
the
rear
ell
and
pale
and
dismayed
stood
in
sight
of
the
shocked
and
terrified
crowd
shrieking
for
help
a
ladder
a
ladder
exclaimed
half
a
dozen
but
there
was
no
ladder
at
hand
none
nearer
than
parmenter
five
minutes
walk
away
while
a
messenger
was
getting

the
fate
of
the
children
would
be
decided

exclaimed
silas

they
break
their
necks
you
fool
returned
his
wife
better
do
that
than
be
burned
up
said
the
old
man
no
one
knew
what
to
do
no
one
but
ben
barclay
he
seized
a
coil
of
rope
and
with
a
speed
which
surprised
even
himself
climbed
up
a
tall
oak
tree
whose
branches
overshadowed
the
roof
of
the
ell
part
in
less
than
a
minute
he
found
himself
on
a
limb
just
over
the
children
to
the
end
of
the
rope
was
fastened
a
strong
iron
hook
undismayed
by
his
own
danger
ben
threw
his
rope
though
he
nearly
lost
his
footing
while
he
was
doing
it
and
with
an
aim
so
precise
that
the
hook
caught
in
the
smaller
girl
dress
hold
on
to
the
rope
jennie
if
you
can
he
shouted
the
girl
obeyed
him
instinctively
drawing
the
cord
hand
over
hand
the
little
girl
swung
clear
and
was
lowered
into
the
arms
of
ebenezer
strong
who
detached
the
hook
save
the
other
ben
shouted
a
dozen
ben
needed
no
spur
to
further
effort
again
he
threw
the
hook
and
this
time
the
older
girl
comprehending
what
was
required
caught
the
rope
and
swung
off
the
roof
scarcely
in
time
for
her
clothing
had
caught
fire
but
when
she
reached
the
ground
ready
hands
extinguished
it
and
the
crowd
of
anxious
spectators
breathed
more
freely
as
ben
throwing
down
the
rope
rapidly
descended
the
tree
and
stood
once
more
in
safety
having
saved
two
lives
just
then
it
was
that
the
poor
mother
almost
frantic
with
fear
arrived
on
the
ground
where
are
my
darlings
who
will
save
them
she
exclaimed
full
of
anguish
yet
not
comprehending
that
they
were
out
of
peril
they
are
safe
and
here
is
the
brave
boy
who
saved
their
lives
said
ebenezer
strong
god
bless
you
ben
barclay
exclaimed
the
poor
mother
you
have
saved
my
life
as
well
as
theirs
for
i
should
have
died
if
they
had
burned
ben
scarcely
heard
her
for
one
and
another
came
up
to
shake
his
hand
and
congratulate
him
upon
his
brave
deed
our
young
hero
was
generally
but
he
hardly
knew
how
to
act
when
he
found
himself
an
object
of
popular
ovation
somebody
else
would
have
done
it
if
i
had
he
said
modestly
you
are
the
only
one
who
had
his
wits
about
him
said
seth
jones
no
one
thought
of
the
rope
till
you
climbed
the
tree
we
were
all
looking
for
a
ladder
and
there
was
none
to
be
had
nearer
than
mr
parmenter
i
would
have
thought
of
it
myself
if
i
had
read
in
a
daily
paper
of
something
like
it
said
ben
ben
said
crawford
i
give
a
thousand
dollars
to
have
done
what
you
did
you
have
shown
yourself
a
hero
oh
ben
how
frightened
i
was
when
i
saw
you
on
the
branch
just
over
the
burning
building
said
a
voice
turning
ben
saw
it
was
his
mother
who
spoke
well
it
all
right
now
mother
he
said
smiling
you
are
not
sorry
i
did
it
sorry
i
am
proud
of
you
i
am
not
proud
of
my
hands
said
ben
look
at
them
they
were
chafed
and
bleeding
having
been
lacerated
by
his
rapid
descent
from
the
tree
come
home
ben
and
let
me
put
some
salve
on
them
how
they
must
pain
you
wait
till
the
fire
is
all
over
mother
the
gallant
firemen
did
all
they
could
but
the
store
was
doomed
they
could
only
prevent
it
from
extending
in
half
an
hour
the
engine
was
taken
back
and
ben
went
home
with
his
mother
it
been
rather
an
exciting
evening
mother
said
ben
i
rather
think
i
shall
have
to
find
a
new
place
chapter
xv
ben
loses
his
place
ben
did
not
find
himself
immediately
out
of
employment
the
next
morning
crawford
commenced
the
work
of
ascertaining
what
articles
he
had
saved
and
storing
them
luckily
there
was
a
vacant
store
which
had
once
been
used
for
a
tailor
shop
but
had
been
unoccupied
for
a
year
or
more
this
he
hired
and
at
once
removed
his
goods
to
it
but
he
did
not
display
his
usual
energy
he
was
a
man
of
over
sixty
and
no
longer
possessed
the
enterprise
and
ambition
which
had
once
characterized
him
besides
he
was
very
comfortably
off
or
would
be
when
he
obtained
the
insurance
money
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
he
said
when
questioned
i
was
brought
up
on
a
farm
and
i
always
meant
to
end
my
days
on
one
perhaps
now
is
as
well
any
time
since
my
business
is
broken
up
this
came
to
the
ears
of
squire
davenport
who
was
always
for
a
bargain
his
wife
cousin
kirk
who
has
already
been
introduced
to
the
reader
had
in
his
earlier
days
served
as
a
clerk
in
a
country
store
he
had
no
capital
to
be
sure
but
the
squire
had
plenty
it
occurred
to
him
as
a
good
plan
to
buy
out
the
business
himself
hire
kirk
on
a
salary
to
conduct
it
and
so
add
considerably
to
his
already
handsome
income
he
sent
for
kirk
ascertained
that
he
was
not
only
willing
but
anxious
to
manage
the
business
and
then
he
called
on
crawford
it
is
unnecessary
to
detail
the
negotiations
that
ensued
it
was
squire
davenport
wish
to
obtain
the
business
as
cheaply
as
possible
the
storekeeper
however
had
his
own
estimate
of
its
worth
and
the
squire
was
obliged
to
add
considerable
to
his
first
offer
in
the
end
however
he
secured
it
on
advantageous
terms
and
crawford
now
felt
able
to
carry
out
the
plan
he
had
long
had
in
view
it
was
in
the
evening
a
week
after
the
fire
that
the
bargain
was
struck
and
ben
was
one
of
the
first
to
hear
of
it
when
he
came
to
work
early
the
next
morning
he
found
his
employer
in
the
store
before
him
which
was
not
usual
you
are
early
crawford
he
said
in
evident
surprise
yes
ben
was
the
reply
i
can
afford
to
come
early
for
a
morning
or
two
as
i
shall
soon
be
out
of
business
you
have
sold
out
have
you
inquired
ben
quickly
yes
the
bargain
was
struck
last
evening
how
soon
do
you
leave
the
store
in
three
days
it
will
take
that
time
to
make
up
my
accounts
i
am
sorry
said
ben
for
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
retire
too
i
do
know
about
that
ben
very
likely
my
successor
may
want
you
that
depends
on
who
he
is
do
you
mind
telling
me
or
is
it
a
secret
oh
no
it
will
have
to
come
out
of
course
squire
davenport
has
bought
the
business
the
squire
is
going
to
keep
the
store
is
he
asked
ben
in
amazement
no
though
he
will
no
doubt
supervise
it
he
will
employ
a
manager
do
you
know
who
is
to
be
the
manager
mr
crawford
some
connection
of
his
named
kirk
ben
whistled
do
you
know
him
the
storekeeper
was
led
to
inquire
i
have
not
seen
him
but
he
called
with
the
squire
on
my
mother
said
ben
significantly
i
shall
be
glad
to
recommend
you
to
him
it
will
be
of
no
use
crawford
answered
ben
in
a
decided
tone
i
know
he
would
employ
me
nor
would
i
work
for
him
if
he
would
neither
he
nor
the
squire
is
a
friend
of
mine
i
did
not
dream
of
this
ben
i
am
sorry
if
the
step
i
have
taken
is
going
to
deprive
you
of
employment
said
crawford
who
was
a
man
and
felt
a
sincere
interest
in
his
young
clerk
never
mind
crawford
i
am
not
cast
down
there
will
be
other
openings
for
me
i
am
young
strong
and
willing
to
work
and
i
am
sure
i
shall
find
something
to
do
that
right
ben
cheer
up
and
if
i
hear
of
any
good
chance
rest
assured
that
i
will
let
you
know
of
it
tom
davenport
was
not
long
in
hearing
of
his
father
bargain
he
heard
it
with
unfeigned
pleasure
for
it
occurred
to
him
at
once
that
ben
for
whom
he
had
a
feeling
of
hatred
by
no
means
creditable
to
him
would
be
thrown
out
of
employment
promise
me
pa
that
you
wo
employ
ben
barclay
he
said
i
have
no
intention
of
employing
that
boy
said
his
father
kirk
has
a
son
of
his
own
about
ben
age
and
will
no
doubt
put
him
into
the
store
unless
you
should
choose
to
go
in
and
learn
the
business
what
i
become
a
store
boy
exclaimed
tom
in
disgust
no
thank
you
i
might
be
willing
to
become
salesman
in
a
large
establishment
in
the
city
but
i
do
care
to
go
into
a
country
grocery
it
would
do
you
any
harm
said
the
squire
who
was
not
quite
so
as
his
son
however
i
merely
mentioned
it
as
something
you
could
do
if
you
chose
bah
i
do
choose
it
said
tom
decidedly
well
well
you
wo
have
to
do
it
it
would
put
me
on
a
level
with
ben
barclay
if
i
stepped
into
his
shoes
wo
he
be
down
in
the
month
when
he
hears
he
has
lost
his
place
and
tom
chuckled
at
the
thought
that
is
no
concern
of
mine
said
the
squire
i
suppose
he
can
hire
out
to
a
farmer
just
the
business
for
him
said
tom
unless
he
should
prefer
to
go
to
new
york
and
set
up
as
a
bootblack
i
believe
i
suggest
that
to
him
probably
he
wo
thank
you
for
the
suggestion
i
guess
not
he
as
proud
as
he
is
poor
it
amusing
to
see
what
airs
he
puts
on
squire
davenport
however
was
not
so
much
interested
in
that
phase
of
the
subject
as
tom
and
did
not
reply
i
think
i
go
down
street
thought
tom
perhaps
i
may
come
across
ben
i
shall
enjoy
seeing
how
he
takes
it
tom
had
scarcely
walked
a
hundred
yards
when
he
met
not
the
one
of
whom
he
had
thought
but
another
to
whom
he
felt
glad
to
speak
on
the
same
subject
this
was
rose
gardiner
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
village
who
had
already
deeply
offended
tom
by
accepting
ben
as
her
escort
from
the
magical
entertainment
in
place
of
him
he
had
made
advances
since
being
desirous
of
ousting
ben
from
his
position
of
favorite
but
the
young
lady
had
treated
him
coldly
much
to
his
anger
and
mortification
miss
rose
said
tom
answered
rose
civilly
have
you
heard
the
news
to
what
news
do
you
refer
crawford
has
sold
out
his
business
indeed
said
rose
in
surprise
who
has
bought
it
my
father
of
course
he
wo
keep
store
himself
he
will
put
in
a
connection
of
ours
mr
kirk
this
is
news
indeed
where
is
crawford
going
i
do
know
i
sure
i
thought
you
be
more
apt
to
inquire
about
somebody
else
i
am
not
good
at
guessing
enigmas
said
rose
your
friend
ben
barclay
returned
tom
with
a
sneer
father
have
him
in
the
store
oh
i
see
you
are
going
to
take
his
place
said
rose
mischievously
i
what
do
you
take
me
for
said
tom
haughtily
i
suppose
ben
barclay
will
have
to
go
to
work
on
a
farm
that
is
a
very
honorable
employment
said
rose
calmly
yes
he
can
be
a
hired
man
when
he
grows
up
perhaps
though
he
will
prefer
to
go
to
the
city
and
become
a
bootblack
ben
ought
to
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
interest
you
feel
in
his
welfare
said
rose
looking
steadily
and
scornfully
at
tom
she
feels
sore
about
it
thought
tom
complacently
she
wo
be
quite
so
ready
to
accept
ben
attentions
when
he
is
a
farm
laborer
tom
however
did
not
understand
rose
gardiner
she
was
a
girl
of
good
sense
and
her
estimate
of
others
was
founded
on
something
else
than
social
position
chapter
xvi
ben
finds
temporary
employment
oh
ben
what
shall
we
do
exclaimed
barclay
when
she
heard
crawford
had
sold
out
his
business
we
get
along
somehow
mother
something
will
be
sure
to
turn
up
ben
spoke
more
cheerfully
than
he
felt
he
knew
very
well
that
pentonville
presented
scarcely
any
field
for
a
boy
unless
he
was
willing
to
work
on
a
farm
now
ben
had
no
objections
to
farm
labor
provided
he
had
a
farm
of
his
own
but
at
the
rate
such
labor
was
paid
in
pentonville
there
was
very
little
chance
of
ever
rising
above
the
position
of
a
hired
man
if
he
once
adopted
the
business
our
young
hero
felt
that
this
would
not
satisfy
him
he
was
enterprising
and
ambitious
and
wanted
to
be
a
rich
man
some
day
money
is
said
by
certain
moralists
to
be
the
root
of
all
evil
the
love
of
money
if
carried
too
far
may
indeed
lead
to
evil
but
it
is
a
natural
ambition
in
any
boy
or
man
to
wish
to
raise
himself
above
poverty
the
wealth
of
amos
lawrence
and
peter
cooper
was
a
source
of
blessing
to
mankind
yet
each
started
as
a
poor
boy
and
neither
would
have
become
rich
if
he
had
not
striven
hard
to
become
so
when
ben
made
this
cheerful
answer
his
mother
shook
her
head
sadly
she
was
not
so
hopeful
as
ben
and
visions
of
poverty
presented
themselves
before
her
mind
i
do
see
what
you
can
find
to
do
in
pentonville
ben
she
said
i
can
live
a
while
without
work
while
i
am
looking
around
mother
ben
answered
we
have
got
all
that
money
i
brought
from
new
york
yet
it
wo
last
long
said
his
mother
despondently
it
will
last
till
i
can
earn
some
more
answered
ben
hopefully
ben
was
about
to
leave
the
house
when
a
man
in
a
farmer
frock
driving
a
yoke
of
oxen
stopped
his
team
in
the
road
and
turned
in
at
the
widow
gate
it
was
silas
greyson
the
owner
of
a
farm
just
out
of
the
village
did
you
want
to
see
mother
asked
ben
no
i
wanted
to
see
you
benjamin
answered
greyson
i
hear

the
store
the
store
has
changed
hands
and
the
new
storekeeper
do
want
me
do
you
want
a
job
what
is
it
mr
greyson
ben
replied
answering
one
question
with
another
i
goin
to
get
in
wood
for
the
winter
from
my
wood
lot
for
about
a
week
said
the
farmer
and
i
want
help
are
you
willin
to
hire
out
for
a
week
what
you
pay
me
asked
ben
i
keep
you
and
give
you
a
cord
of
wood
your
mother
find
it
handy
i
short
of
money
and
wood
be
just
as
good
pay
ben
thought
over
the
proposal
and
answered
i
rather
take
my
meals
at
home
greyson
and
if
you
make
it
two
cords
with
that
understanding
i
agree
to
hire
out
to
you
ai
that
rather
high
asked
the
farmer
hesitating
i
do
think
so
finally
silas
greyson
agreed
and
ben
promised
to
be
on
hand
bright
and
early
the
next
day
it
may
be
stated
here
that
wood
was
very
cheap
at
pentonville
so
that
ben
would
not
be
overpaid
there
were
some
few
things
about
the
house
which
ben
wished
to
do
for
his
mother
before
he
went
to
work
anywhere
and
he
thought
this
a
good
opportunity
to
do
them
while
in
the
store
his
time
had
been
so
taken
up
that
he
was
unable
to
attend
to
them
he
passed
a
busy
day
therefore
and
hardly
went
into
the
street
just
at
nightfall
as
he
was
in
the
front
yard
he
was
rather
surprised
to
see
tom
davenport
open
the
gate
and
enter
what
does
he
want
i
wonder
he
thought
but
he
said
in
a
civil
tone
tom
you
out
of
business
ai
you
asked
tom
abruptly
i
not
out
of
work
at
any
rate
answered
ben
why
what
work
are
you
doing
interrogated
tom
in
evident
disappointment
i
been
doing
some
jobs
about
the
house
for
mother
that
wo
give
you
a
living
said
tom
disdainfully
very
true
did
you
expect
to
stay
in
the
store
asked
tom
not
after
i
heard
that
your
father
had
bought
it
answered
ben
quietly
my
father
willing
to
give
you
work
said
tom
is
he
asked
ben
very
much
surprised
it
occurred
to
him
that
perhaps
he
would
have
a
chance
to
remain
in
the
store
after
all
and
for
the
present
that
would
have
suited
him
though
he
did
like
the
squire
or
kirk
he
felt
that
he
had
no
right
in
his
present
circumstances
to
refuse
any
way
to
earn
an
honest
living
yes
answered
tom
i
told
him
he
better
hire
you
you
did
exclaimed
ben
more
and
more
amazed
i
did
expect
that
however
go
on
if
you
please
he
got
three
cords
of
wood
that
he
wants
sawed
and
split
said
tom
and
as
i
knew
how
poor
you
were
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
chance
for
you
you
might
have
thought
from
tom
manner
that
he
was
a
young
lord
and
ben
a
peasant
ben
was
not
angry
but
amused
it
is
true
he
said
i
am
not
rich
still
i
am
not
as
poor
as
you
think
he
happened
to
have
in
his
pocketbook
the
money
he
had
brought
from
new
york
and
this
he
took
from
his
pocket
and
displayed
to
the
astonished
tom
where
did
you
get
that
money
asked
tom
surprised
and
chagrined
i
got
it
honestly
you
see
we
can
hold
out
a
few
days
however
i
may
be
willing
to
accept
the
job
you
offer
me
how
much
is
your
father
willing
to
pay
me
he
is
willing
to
give
you
forty
cents
a
day
how
long
does
he
expect
me
to
work
for
that
ten
hours
that
is
four
cents
an
hour
and
hard
work
at
that
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
and
him
tom
for
your
liberal
offer
but
i
ca
accept
it
you
see
the
time
when
you
be
glad
to
take
such
a
job
said
tom
who
was
personally
disappointed
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
exhibit
ben
as
his
father
hired
dependent
you
seem
to
know
all
about
it
tom
answered
ben
i
shall
be
at
work
all
next
week
at
much
higher
pay
for
silas
greyson
how
much
does
he
pay
you
that
is
my
private
business
and
would
interest
you
you
mighty
independent
for
a
boy
in
your
position
very
likely
wo
you
come
in
no
answered
tom
ungraciously
i
wasted
too
much
time
here
already
i
understand
tom
object
in
wanting
to
hire
me
thought
ben
he
wants
to
order
me
around
still
if
the
squire
had
been
willing
to
pay
a
decent
price
i
would
have
accepted
the
job
i
wo
let
pride
stand
in
the
way
of
my
supporting
mother
and
myself
this
was
a
sensible
and
praiseworthy
resolution
as
i
hope
my
young
readers
will
admit
i
do
think
much
of
the
pride
that
is
willing
to
let
others
suffer
in
order
that
it
may
be
gratified
ben
worked
a
full
week
for
farmer
greyson
and
helped
unload
the
two
cords
of
wood
which
were
his
wages
in
his
mother
yard
then
there
were
two
days
of
idleness
which
made
him
anxious
on
the
second
day
just
after
supper
he
met
rose
gardiner
coming
from
the
post
office
have
you
any
correspondents
in
new
york
ben
she
asked
what
makes
you
ask
rose
because
the
postmaster
told
me
there
was
a
letter
for
you
by
this
evening
mail
it
was
mailed
in
new
york
and
was
directed
in
a
lady
hand
i
hope

been
flirting
with
any
new
york
ladies
mr
barclay
the
only
lady
i
know
in
new
york
is
at
least
fifty
years
old
answered
ben
smiling
that
is
satisfactory
answered
rose
solemnly
then
i
wo
be
jealous
what
can
the
letter
be
thought
ben
i
hope
it
contains
good
news
he
hurried
to
the
post
office
in
a
fever
of
excitement
chapter
xvii
what
the
letter
contained
i
hear
there
is
a
letter
for
me
brown
said
ben
to
the
postmaster
who
was
folding
the
evening
papers
of
which
he
received
a
parcel
from
the
city
by
the
afternoon
train

answered
the
postmaster
smiling
it
appears
to
be
from
a
lady

new
york

have
improved
your
time
during
your
recent
visit
to
the
city

made
the
acquaintance
of
one
lady
older
than
my
mother
answered
ben
i
did
flirt
with
her
any
at
any
rate
i
should
judge
that
she
became
interested
in
you
or
she
would
write
i
hope
she
did
for
she
is
very
wealthy
returned
ben
the
letter
was
placed
in
his
hands
and
he
quickly
tore
it
open
something
dropped
from
it
what
is
that
asked
the
postmaster
ben
stooped
and
picked
it
up
and
to
his
surprise

joyful
excitement
as
he
read

at
a
better
time
for
as
we
know
he
was
out
of
employment

of
course

well
ben
said
the
postmaster

curiosity

excited

a
generous

your
mother

ben
looking
suddenly
sober
i
hate
to
leave
her
but
it
is
for
my
good
mothers

when
the
interests
of
their
children
are
concerned
i
know
that
said
ben
promptly
and
i
got
one
of
the
best
mothers
going
so
you
have
every
one
likes
and
respects
mrs
barclay
any
boy
who
is
worth
anything
likes
to
hear
his
mother
praised
and
ben
liked
brown
better
for
this
tribute
to
the
one
whom
he
loved
best
on
earth
he
was
not
slow
in
making
his
way
home
he
went
at
once
to
the
kitchen
where
his
mother
was
engaged
in
mixing
bread
what
the
matter
ben
you
look
excited
said
barkley
so
i
am
mother
i
am
offered
a
position
not
in
the
store
no
it
is
in
new
york
in
new
york
repeated
his
mother
in
a
troubled
voice
it
would
cost
you
all
you
could
make
to
pay
your
board
in
some
cheap
boarding
house
if
it
were
really
going
to
be
for
your
own
good
i
might
consent
to
part
with
you
but
read
that
letter
mother
said
ben
you
will
see
that
i
shall
have
an
elegant
home
and
a
salary
besides
it
is
a
chance
in
a
thousand
barclay
read
the
letter
carefully
can
i
go
mother
ben
asked
anxiously
it
will
be
a
sacrifice
for
me
to
part
with
you
returned
his
mother
slowly
but
i
agree
with
you
that
it
is
a
rare
chance
and
i
should
be
doing
wrong
to
stand
in
the
way
of
your
good
fortune
hamilton
must
have
formed
a
very
good
opinion
of
you
she
may
be
disappointed
in
me
said
ben
modestly
i
do
think
she
will
said
barclay
with
a
proud
and
affectionate
glance
at
her
boy
you
have
always
been
a
good
son
and
that
is
the
best
of
recommendations
i
am
afraid
you
are
too
partial
mother
i
shall
hate
to
leave
you
alone
i
can
bear
loneliness
if
i
know
you
are
prospering
ben
and
it
will
only
be
for
a
time
mother
when
i
am
a
young
man
and
earning
a
good
income
i
shall
want
you
to
come
and
live
with
me
all
in
good
time
ben
how
soon
do
you
want
to
go
i
think
it
better
to
lose
no
time
mother
you
know
i
have
no
work
to
keep
me
in
pentonville
but
it
will
take
two
or
three
days
to
get
your
clothes
ready
you
can
send
them
to
me
by
express
i
shall
send
you
the
address
barclay
was
a
fond
mother
but
she
was
also
a
sensible
woman
she
felt
that
ben
was
right
and
though
it
seemed
very
sudden
she
gave
him
her
permission
to
start
the
next
morning
had
she
objected
strenuously
ben
would
have
given
up
his
plan
much
as
he
desired
it
for
he
felt
that
his
mother
had
the
strongest
claims
upon
him
and
he
would
not
have
been
willing
to
run
counter
to
her
wishes
where
are
you
going
ben
asked
his
mother
as
ben
put
on
his
hat
and
moved
toward
the
door
i
thought
i
would
like
to
call
on
rose
gardiner
to
say
answered
ben
quite
right
my
son
rose
is
a
good
friend
of
yours
and
an
excellent
girl
i
say
ditto
to
that
mother
ben
answered
warmly
i
am
not
going
to
represent
ben
as
being
in
love
he
was
too
young
for
that
but
like
many
boys
of
his
age
he
felt
a
special
attraction
in
the
society
of
one
young
girl
his
good
taste
was
certainly
not
at
fault
in
his
choice
of
rose
gardiner
who
far
from
being
frivolous
and
fashionable
was
a
girl
of
sterling
traits
who
was
not
above
making
herself
useful
in
the
household
of
which
she
formed
a
part
on
his
way
to
the
home
of
rose
gardiner
ben
met
tom
davenport
how
are
you
getting
along
asked
tom
not
out
of
interest
but
curiosity
very
well
thank
you
have
you
got
through
helping
the
farmer
yes
it
was
a
very
long
job
have
you
thought
better
of
coming
to
saw
wood
for
father
no
i
have
thought
worse
of
it
answered
ben
smiling
you
are
too
proud
poor
and
proud
do
agree
not
at
all
i
would
have
had
no
objection
to
the
work
it
was
the
pay
i
did
like
you
ca
earn
more
than
forty
cents
a
day
at
anything
else
you
are
mistaken
i
am
going
to
new
york
to
take
a
place
where
i
get
board
and
considerable
more
money
besides
is
that
true
asked
tom
looking
as
if
he
had
lost
his
best
friend
quite
so
the
party
inclosed
ten
dollars
to
pay
my
expenses
up
to
the
city
he
must
be
a
fool
thank
you
it
happens
to
be
a
lady
what
are
you
to
do
i
do
know
yet
i
am
sure
i
shall
be
well
paid
i
must
ask
you
to
excuse
me
now
as
i
am
going
to
call
on
rose
gardiner
to
bid
her
i
dare
say
she
would
excuse
you
said
tom
with
a
sneer
perhaps
so
but
i
would
like
to
go
without
saying
at
any
rate
he
will
be
out
of
my
way
thought
tom
and
i
can
monopolize
rose
i
glad
he
going
he
bade
ben
an
unusually
civil
at
this
thought
occurred
to
him
chapter
xviii
farewell
to
pentonville
i
have
come
to
say
rose
said
ben
as
the
young
lady
made
her
appearance
repeated
rose
in
surprise
why
where
are
you
going
to
new
york
but
you
are
coming
back
again
i
hope
so
but
only
for
a
visit
now
and
then
i
am
offered
a
position
in
the
city
is
that
rather
sudden
said
rose
after
a
pause
ben
explained
how
he
came
to
be
offered
employment
i
am
to
receive
higher
pay
than
i
did
here
and
a
home
besides
he
added
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
do
you
think
i
am
lucky
yes
ben
and
i
rejoice
in
your
good
fortune
but
i
shall
miss
you
so
much
said
rose
frankly
i
am
glad
of
that
returned
ben
i
hoped
you
would
miss
me
a
little
you
go
and
see
mother
now
and
then
wo
you
she
will
feel
very
lonely
you
may
be
sure
i
will
it
is
a
pity
you
have
to
go
away
a
great
many
will
be
sorry
i
know
someone
who
wo
who
is
that
tom
davenport
rose
smiled
she
had
a
little
idea
why
tom
would
not
regret
absence
tom
could
be
spared
as
well
as
not
she
said
he
is
a
strong
admirer
of
yours
i
believe
said
ben
mischievously
i
do
admire
him
retorted
rose
with
a
little
toss
of
her
head
ben
heard
this
with
satisfaction
for
though
he
was
too
young
to
be
a
lover
he
did
have
a
strong
feeling
of
attraction
toward
rose
and
would
have
been
sorry
to
have
tom
step
into
his
place
as
ben
was
preparing
to
go
rose
said
wait
a
minute
ben
she
left
the
room
and
went
upstairs
but
returned
almost
immediately
with
a
small
knit
purse
wo
you
accept
this
ben
she
said
i
just
finished
it
yesterday
it
will
remind
you
of
me
when
you
are
away
thank
you
rose
i
shall
need
nothing
to
keep
you
in
my
remembrance
but
i
will
value
it
for
your
sake
i
hope
you
will
be
fortunate
and
fill
it
very
soon
ben
so
the
two
parted
on
the
most
friendly
terms
and
the
next
day
ben
started
for
new
york
in
the
highest
of
spirits
after
purchasing
his
ticket
he
gave
place
to
squire
davenport
who
also
called
for
a
ticket
to
new
york
now
it
so
happened
that
the
squire
had
not
seen
tom
since
the
interview
of
the
latter
with
our
hero
and
was
in
ignorance
of
his
good
luck
are
you
going
to
new
york
benjamin
he
asked
in
surprise
yes
sir
is
it
rather
extravagant
for
one
in
your
circumstances
yes
sir
if
i
had
no
object
in
view
have
you
any
business
in
the
city
yes
sir
i
am
going
to
take
a
place
squire
davenport
was
still
more
surprised
and
asked
particulars
these
ben
readily
gave
for
he
was
quite
elated
by
his
good
fortune
oh
that
it
is
it
said
the
squire
contemptuously
i
thought
you
might
have
secured
a
position
in
some
business
house
this
lady
probably
wants
you
to
answer
the
doorbell
and
clean
the
knives
or
something
of
that
sort
i
am
sure
she
does
not
said
ben
indignant
and
mortified
you
find
i
am
right
said
the
squire
confidently
young
man
i
ca
congratulate
you
on
your
prospects
you
would
have
done
as
well
to
stay
in
pentonville
and
work
on
my
woodpile
whatever
work
i
may
do
in
new
york
i
shall
be
a
good
deal
better
paid
for
than
here
retorted
ben
squire
davenport
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
began
to
read
the
morning
paper
to
do
him
justice
he
only
said
what
he
thought
when
he
predicted
to
ben
that
he
would
be
called
upon
to
do
menial
work
the
boy
wo
be
in
so
good
spirits
a
week
hence
he
thought
however
that
is
not
my
affair
there
is
no
doubt
that
i
shall
get
possession
of
his
mother
house
when
the
three
months
are
up
and
i
do
at
all
care
where
he
and
his
mother
go
if
they
leave
pentonville
i
shall
be
very
well
satisfied
i
have
no
satisfaction
in
meeting
either
of
them
and
the
squire
frowned
as
if
some
unpleasant
thought
had
crossed
his
mind
nothing
of
note
passed
during
the
remainder
of
the
journey
ben
arrived
in
new
york
and
at
once
took
a
conveyance
uptown
and
due
time
found
himself
in
hand
on
the
front
steps
of
hamilton
house
he
rang
the
bell
and
the
door
was
opened
by
a
servant
she
out
shopping
answered
the
girl
looking
inquisitively
at
ben
will
you
leave
a
message
for
her
i
believe
i
am
expected
said
ben
feeling
a
little
awkward
my
name
is
benjamin
barclay
hamilton
did
say
anything
about
expecting
any
boy
returned
the
servant
you
can
come
in
if
you
like
and
i
call
mrs
hill
i
suppose
that
is
the
housekeeper
thought
ben
very
well
he
answered
i
believe
i
will
come
in
as
hamilton
wrote
me
to
come
ben
left
his
bag
in
the
front
hall
and
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
followed
the
servant
into
the
drawing
room
i
wish
hamilton
had
been
here
he
said
to
himself
the
girl
seems
to
look
at
me
suspiciously
i
hope
the
housekeeper
knows
about
my
coming
ben
sat
down
in
an
beside
a
center
table
and
waited
for
fifteen
minutes
before
anyone
appeared
he
beguiled
the
time
by
looking
over
a
handsomely
illustrated
book
of
views
but
presently
the
door
was
pushed
open
and
he
looked
up
the
newcomer
was
a
spare
woman
with
a
querulous
expression
who
stared
coldly
at
our
hero
it
was
clear
that
she
was
not
glad
to
see
him
what
can
i
do
for
you
young
man
she
asked
in
a
repellent
tone
what
a
woman
thought
ben
i
am
sure
we
shall
never
be
friends
is
hamilton
expected
in
soon
he
asked
i
really
can
not
say
she
does
not
report
to
me
how
long
she
expects
to
be
gone
did
she
speak
to
you
about
expecting
me
asked
ben
feeling
decidedly
uncomfortable
not
a
word
was
the
reply
she
wrote
to
me
to
come
here
but
perhaps
she
did
not
expect
me
so
soon
if
you
have
come
here
to
collect
a
bill
or
with
any
business
errand
i
can
attend
to
you
i
am
hamilton
cousin
thank
you
it
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
see
mrs
hamilton
then
you
may
as
well
call
in
the
afternoon
or
some
other
day
that
pretty
cool
thought
ben
that
woman
wants
to
get
me
out
of
the
house
but
i
propose
to
the
fort
till
hamilton
arrives
i
thought
you
might
know
that
i
am
going
to
stay
here
said
ben
what
exclaimed
hill
in
genuine
surprise
hamilton
has
offered
me
a
position
though
i
do
not
know
what
the
duties
are
to
be
and
am
going
to
make
my
home
here
really
this
is
too
much
said
the
lady
sternly
here
conrad
she
called
going
to
the
door
a
third
party
made
his
appearance
on
the
scene
a
boy
who
looked
so
much
like
hill
that
it
was
clear
she
was
his
mother
he
was
two
inches
taller
than
ben
but
looked
pale
and
flabby
what
wanted
ma
he
said
staring
at
ben
this
young
man
has
made
a
strange
mistake
he
says
hamilton
has
sent
for
him
and
that
he
is
going
to
live
here
he
got
cheek
exclaimed
conrad
continuing
to
stare
at
ben
tell
him
he
better
go
you
better
go
said
the
boy
like
a
parrot
thank
you
returned
ben
provoked
but
i
mean
to
stay
go
and
call
a
policeman
conrad
said
hill
we
see
what
he
have
to
say
then
chapter
xix
a
cool
reception
this
is
quite
the
reception
i
expected
thought
ben
he
was
provoked
with
the
disagreeable
woman
who
persisted
in
regarding
and
treating
him
as
an
intruder
but
he
was
not
nervous
or
alarmed
he
knew
that
things
would
come
right
and
that
hill
and
her
promising
son
would
see
their
mistake
he
had
half
a
mind
to
let
conrad
call
a
policeman
and
then
turn
the
tables
upon
his
foes
but
he
knew
that
this
would
be
disagreeable
to
hamilton
whose
feelings
he
was
bound
to
consider
before
you
call
a
policeman
he
said
quietly
it
may
be
well
for
you
to
read
this
letter
as
he
spoke
handed
hill
the
letter
he
had
received
from
hamilton
hill
took
the
letter
suspiciously
and
glared
over
it
as
she
read
a
spot
of
red
glowed
in
each
pallid
check
and
she
bit
her
lips
in
annoyance
i
do
understand
it
she
said
slowly
ben
did
not
feel
called
upon
to
explain
what
was
perfectly
intelligible
he
saw
that
hill
did
want
to
understand
it
what
is
it
ma
asked
conrad
his
curiosity
aroused
you
can
read
it
for
yourself
conrad
returned
his
mother
is
he
coming
to
live
here
ejaculated
conrad
astonished
indicating
ben
with
a
jerk
of
his
finger
if
this
letter
is
genuine
said
hill
with
at
significant
emphasis
on
the
last
word
if
it
is
not
hamilton
will
be
sure
to
tell
you
so
said
ben
provoked
come
out
conrad
i
want
to
speak
to
you
said
his
mother
without
ceremony
they
left
ben
in
the
parlor
alone
and
withdrew
to
another
part
of
the
house
where
they
held
a
conference
what
does
it
all
mean
ma
asked
conrad
it
means
that
your
prospects
are
threatened
my
poor
boy
cousin
hamilton
who
is
very
eccentric
has
taken
a
fancy
to
this
boy
and
she
is
going
to
confer
favors
upon
him
at
your
expense
it
is
too
bad
i
like
to
break
his
head
said
conrad
scowling
it
wo
do
conrad
to
fight
him
openly
we
must
do
what
we
can
in
an
underhand
way
to
undermine
him
with
cousin
hamilton
she
ought
to
make
you
her
heir
as
she
has
no
children
of
her
own
i
do
think
she
likes
me
said
the
boy
she
only
gives
me
two
dollars
a
week
allowance
and
she
scolded
me
the
other
day
because
she
met
me
in
the
hall
smoking
a
cigarette
be
sure
not
to
offend
her
conrad
a
great
deal
depends
on
it
two
dollars
ought
to
answer
for
the
present
when
you
are
a
young
man
you
may
be
in
very
different
circumstances
i
do
know
about
that
grumbled
conrad
i
may
get
two
dollars
a
week
then
but
what
that
you
may
be
a
wealthy
man
said
his
mother
impressively
cousin
hamilton
is
not
so
healthy
as
she
looks
i
have
a
suspicion
that
her
heart
is
affected
she
might
die
suddenly
do
you
really
think
so
said
conrad
eagerly
i
think
so
what
you
must
try
to
do
is
to
stand
well
with
her
and
get
her
to
make
her
will
in
your
favor
i
will
attend
to
that
if
you
will
do
as
i
tell
you
she
may
make
this
boy
her
heir
said
conrad
discontentedly
then
where
would
i
be
she
wo
do
it
if
i
can
help
it
said
hill
with
an
emphatic
nod
i
will
manage
to
make
trouble
between
them
you
will
always
be
my
first
interest
my
dear
boy
she
made
a
motion
to
kiss
her
dear
boy
but
conrad
who
was
by
no
means
of
an
affectionate
disposition
moved
his
head
suddenly
with
an
impatient
exclamation
oh
bother
a
pained
look
came
over
the
mother
face
for
she
loved
her
son
unattractive
and
disagreeable
as
he
was
with
a
love
the
greater
because
she
loved
no
one
else
in
the
world
mother
and
son
were
selfish
alike
but
the
son
the
more
so
for
he
had
not
a
spark
of
love
for
any
human
being
there
the
bell
said
hill
suddenly
i
do
believe
cousin
hamilton
has
come
now
we
shall
find
out
whether
this
boy
story
is
true
let
go
downstairs
ma
i
hope
it
all
a
mistake
and
she
send
me
for
a
policeman
i
am
afraid
the
boy
story
is
correct
but
his
day
will
be
short
when
they
reached
the
hall
hamilton
had
already
been
admitted
to
the
house
there
a
boy
in
the
drawing
room
hamilton
said
hill
who
says
he
is
to
stay
here
that
you
sent
for
him
has
he
come
already
returned
hamilton
i
am
glad
of
it
then
you
did
send
for
him
of
course
did
i
mention
it
to
you
i
hardly
expected
he
would
come
so
soon
she
opened
the
door
of
the
drawing
room
and
approached
ben
with
extended
hand
and
a
pleasant
smile
welcome
to
new
york
ben
she
said
i
hope
i
have
kept
you
waiting
long
not
very
long
answered
ben
shaking
her
hand
this
is
my
cousin
hill
who
relieves
me
of
part
of
my
housekeeping
care
continued
hamilton
and
this
is
her
son
conrad
conrad
this
is
a
companion
for
you
benjamin
barclay
who
will
be
a
new
member
of
our
small
family
i
hope
you
are
well
conrad
said
ben
with
a
smile
to
the
boy
who
but
a
short
time
before
was
going
for
a
policeman
to
put
him
under
arrest
i
all
right
said
conrad
ungraciously
really
cousin
hamilton
this
is
a
surprise
said
hill
you
are
quite
kind
to
provide
conrad
with
a
companion
but
i
do
think
he
felt
the
need
of
any
except
his
mother
and
you
hamilton
laughed
she
saw
that
neither
hill
nor
conrad
was
glad
to
see
ben
and
this
was
only
what
she
expected
and
indeed
this
was
the
chief
reason
why
she
had
omitted
to
mention
expected
arrival
you
give
me
too
much
credit
she
said
if
you
think
i
invited
this
young
gentleman
here
solely
as
a
companion
to
conrad
i
shall
have
some
writing
and
accounts
for
him
to
attend
to
i
am
sure
conrad
would
have
been
glad
to
serve
you
in
that
way
cousin
hamilton
said
hill
i
am
sorry
you
did
not
give
him
the
first
chance
conrad
would
have
suited
me
said
hamilton
bluntly
perhaps
i
may
not
be
competent
suggested
ben
modestly
we
can
tell
better
after
trying
you
said
his
patroness
as
for
conrad
i
have
obtained
a
position
for
him
he
is
to
enter
the
offices
of
jones
woodhull
on
pearl
street
you
will
take
an
early
breakfast
conrad
for
it
will
be
necessary
for
you
to
be
at
the
office
at
eight
how
much
am
i
to
get
asked
conrad
four
dollars
a
week
i
shall
let
you
have
all
this
in
lieu
of
the
weekly
allowance
i
pay
you
but
will
provide
you
with
clothing
as
heretofore
so
that
this
will
keep
you
liberally
supplied
with
pocket
money
conrad
brow
cleared
he
was
lazy
and
did
not
enjoy
going
to
work
but
the
increase
of
his
allowance
would
be
satisfactory
and
now
ben
hill
will
kindly
show
you
your
room
it
is
the
large
hall
bedroom
on
the
third
floor
when
you
have
unpacked
your
valise
and
got
to
feel
at
home
come
downstairs
and
we
will
have
a
little
conversation
upon
business
you
will
find
me
in
the
sitting
room
on
the
next
floor
thank
you
said
ben
politely
and
he
followed
the
pallid
cousin
upstairs
he
was
shown
into
a
handsomely
furnished
room
bright
and
cheerful
this
is
a
very
pleasant
room
he
said
you
wo
occupy
it
long
said
hill
to
herself
no
one
will
step
into
my
conrad
place
if
i
can
help
it
chapter
xx
entering
upon
his
duties
when
ben
had
taken
out
his
clothing
from
his
valise
and
put
it
away
in
the
drawers
of
the
handsome
bureau
which
formed
a
part
of
the
furniture
of
his
room
he
went
downstairs
and
found
his
patroness
in
a
cozy
sitting
room
on
the
second
floor
it
was
furnished
ben
could
not
help
thinking
more
as
if
it
were
designed
for
a
gentleman
than
a
lady
in
one
corner
was
a
library
table
with
writing
materials
books
and
papers
upon
it
and
an
array
of
drawers
on
either
side
of
the
central
part
come
right
in
ben
said
hamilton
who
was
seated
at
the
table
we
will
talk
of
business
this
ben
was
quite
willing
to
do
he
was
anxious
to
know
what
were
to
be
his
duties
that
he
might
judge
whether
he
was
competent
to
discharge
them
let
me
tell
you
to
begin
with
said
his
patroness
that
i
am
possessed
of
considerable
wealth
as
indeed
you
may
have
judged
by
way
of
living
i
have
no
children
unfortunately
and
being
unwilling
selfishly
to
devote
my
entire
means
to
my
own
use
exclusively
i
try
to
help
others
in
a
way
that
i
think
most
suitable
hill
who
acts
as
my
housekeeper
is
a
cousin
who
made
a
poor
marriage
and
was
left
penniless
i
have
given
a
home
to
her
and
her
son
i
do
think
hill
likes
my
being
here
said
ben
you
are
no
doubt
right
she
is
foolish
enough
to
be
jealous
because
i
do
not
bestow
all
my
favors
upon
her
i
think
she
will
look
upon
me
as
a
rival
of
her
son
i
expected
she
would
perhaps
she
will
learn
after
a
while
that
i
can
be
a
friend
to
you
and
him
both
though
i
am
free
to
admit
i
have
never
been
able
to
take
any
fancy
to
conrad
nor
indeed
was
his
mother
a
favorite
with
me
but
for
her
needy
circumstances
she
is
perhaps
the
last
of
my
relatives
that
i
would
invite
to
become
a
member
of
my
household
however
to
come
to
business
my
money
is
invested
in
various
ways
besides
the
ordinary
forms
of
investment
stocks
bonds
and
mortgages
i
have
set
up
two
or
three
young
men
whom
i
thought
worthy
in
business
and
require
them
to
send
in
monthly
statements
of
their
business
to
me
you
see
therefore
that
i
have
more
or
less
to
do
with
accounts
i
never
had
much
taste
for
figures
and
it
struck
me
that
i
might
relieve
myself
of
considerable
drudgery
if
i
could
obtain
your
assistance
under
my
supervision
of
course
i
hope
you
have
a
taste
for
figures
arithmetic
and
algebra
are
my
favorite
studies
said
ben
promptly
i
am
glad
of
it
of
course
i
did
not
know
that
but
had
you
not
been
well
versed
in
accounts
i
meant
to
send
you
to
a
commercial
school
to
qualify
you
for
the
duties
i
wished
to
impose
upon
you
i
do
think
it
will
be
necessary
answered
ben
i
have
taken
lessons
in
bookkeeping
at
home
and
though
it
seems
like
boasting
i
was
better
in
mathematics
than
any
of
my
schoolfellows
i
am
so
glad
to
hear
that
can
you
write
well
shall
i
write
something
for
you
do
so
hamilton
vacated
her
place
and
ben
sitting
at
the
desk
wrote
two
or
three
copies
from
remembrance
very
well
indeed
said
his
patroness
approvingly
i
see
that
in
engaging
you
i
have
made
no
mistake
ben
cheek
flushed
with
pleasure
and
he
was
eager
to
enter
upon
his
new
duties
but
he
could
not
help
wondering
why
he
had
been
selected
when
conrad
was
already
in
the
house
and
unemployed
he
ventured
to
say
would
you
mind
telling
me
why
you
did
not
employ
conrad
instead
of
sending
for
me
there
are
two
good
and
sufficient
reasons
conrad
is
not
competent
for
such
an
office
and
secondly
i
should
not
like
to
have
the
boy
about
me
as
much
as
he
would
need
to
be
i
have
obtained
for
him
a
position
out
of
the
house
one
question
remains
to
be
considered
how
much
wages
do
you
expect
i
would
prefer
to
leave
that
to
you
hamilton
i
can
not
expect
high
pay
will
ten
dollars
a
week
be
adequate
i
ca
earn
as
much
money
as
that
said
ben
in
surprise
perhaps
not
and
yet
i
am
not
sure
if
you
suit
me
it
will
be
worth
my
while
to
pay
you
as
much
but
conrad
will
only
receive
four
dollars
a
week
wo
he
be
angry
conrad
is
not
called
upon
to
support
his
mother
as
i
understand
you
are
you
are
very
kind
to
think
of
that
mrs
hamilton
i
want
to
be
kind
to
you
ben
said
his
patroness
with
a
pleasant
smile
when
shall
i
commence
my
duties
now
you
will
copy
this
statement
into
the
ledger
you
see
here
before
doing
so
will
you
look
over
and
verify
the
figures
ben
was
soon
hard
at
work
he
was
interested
in
his
work
and
the
time
slipped
fast
after
an
hour
and
a
half
had
passed
hamilton
said
it
is
about
time
for
lunch
and
i
think
there
will
be
no
more
to
do
are
you
familiar
with
new
york
no
i
have
spent
very
little
time
in
the
city
you
will
no
doubt
like
to
look
about
we
have
dinner
at
six
sharp
you
will
be
on
tine
i
will
be
sure
to
be
here
that
reminds
me
have
you
a
watch
ben
shook
his
head
i
thought
it
might
be
so
i
have
a
good
silver
watch
which
i
have
no
occasion
for
hamilton
left
the
room
and
quickly
returned
with
a
neat
silver
watch
with
a
guilt
chain
this
is
yours
ben
she
said
if
you
like
it
do
you
give
it
to
me
asked
ben
joyously
he
had
only
expected
that
it
would
be
loaned
to
him
yes
i
give
it
to
you
and
i
hope
you
will
find
it
useful
how
can
i
thank
you
hamilton
for
your
kindness
you
are
more
grateful
than
conrad
i
gave
him
one
just
like
it
and
he
was
evidently
dissatisfied
became
it
was
not
gold
when
you
are
older
the
gold
watch
may
come
i
am
very
well
pleased
with
the
silver
watch
for
i
have
long
wanted
one
but
did
not
see
any
way
of
obtaining
it
you
are
wise
in
having
moderate
desires
ben
but
there
goes
the
lunch
bell
you
may
want
to
wash
your
hands
when
you
have
done
so
come
down
to
the
dining
room
in
the
rear
of
the
sitting
room
hill
and
conrad
were
already
seated
at
the
table
when
ben
descended
take
a
seat
opposite
conrad
ben
said
hamilton
who
was
sitting
at
one
end
of
the
table
the
lunch
was
plain
but
substantial
and
ben
who
had
taken
an
early
breakfast
enjoyed
it
i
suppose
we
shall
not
have
conrad
at
lunch
said
hamilton
he
will
be
at
the
store
conrad
made
a
grimace
he
world
have
enjoyed
his
freedom
better
i
wo
have
much
of
my
four
dollars
left
if
i
have
to
pay
for
lunch
he
said
in
a
surly
tone
you
shall
have
a
reasonable
allowance
for
that
purpose
i
suppose
barclay
will
lunch
at
home
said
hill
certainly
since
his
work
will
be
here
he
is
to
be
my
home
clerk
and
will
keep
my
accounts
you
need
have
gone
out
of
the
house
for
a
clerk
cousin
hamilton
i
am
sure
conrad
would
have
been
glad
of
the
work
it
will
be
better
for
conrad
to
learn
business
in
a
larger
establishment
said
hamilton
quietly
this
was
a
new
way
of
looking
at
it
and
helped
to
reconcile
hill
to
an
arrangement
which
at
first
had
disappointed
her
have
you
any
engagements
this
afternoon
conrad
asked
hamilton
ben
will
have
nothing
to
do
and
you
could
show
him
the
city
i
got
an
engagement
with
a
fellow
said
conrad
hastily
i
can
find
my
way
about
alone
thank
you
said
ben
i
trouble
conrad
very
well
this
evening
however
ben
i
think
you
may
enjoy
going
to
the
theater
conrad
can
accompany
you
unless
he
has
another
engagement
i
go
with
him
said
conrad
more
graciously
for
he
was
fond
of
amusements
then
we
will
all
meet
at
dinner
and
you
two
young
gentlemen
can
leave
in
good
time
for
the
theater
chapter
xxi
at
the
theater
after
dinner
ben
and
conrad
started
to
walk
to
the
theater
the
distance
was
about
a
mile
but
in
the
city
there
is
so
much
always
to
be
seen
that
one
does
not
think
of
distance
conrad
who
was
very
curious
to
ascertain
ben
status
in
the
household
lost
no
time
in
making
inquiries
what
does
my
aunt
find
for
you
to
do
he
asked
it
may
be
remarked
by
the
way
that
no
such
relationship
ever
existed
between
them
but
hill
and
her
son
thought
politic
to
make
the
relationship
seem
as
close
as
possible
as
it
would
perhaps
increase
their
apparent
claim
upon
their
rich
relative
ben
answered
the
question
you
have
a
stupid
time
said
conrad
all
the
same
she
ought
to
have
given
the
place
to
me
how
much
does
she
pay
you
ben
hesitated
for
he
knew
that
his
answer
would
make
his
companion
discontented
i
am
not
sure
whether
i
am
at
liberty
to
tell
he
answered
with
hesitation
there
is
any
secret
about
it
is
there
said
conrad
sharply
no
i
suppose
not
i
am
to
receive
ten
dollars
a
week
ten
dollars
a
week
ejaculated
conrad
stopping
short
in
the
street
yes
and
i
get
but
four
that
a
shame
i
shall
really
have
no
more
than
you
conrad
i
have
a
mother
to
provide
for
and
i
shall
send
home
six
dollars
a
week
regularly
that
does
make
any
difference
exclaimed
conrad
in
excitement
it
awfully
mean
of
aunt
to
treat
you
so
much
better
than
she
does
me
you
must
say
that
to
me
said
ben
she
has
been
kind
to
us
both
and
i
do
like
to
hear
anything
said
against
her
you
not
going
to
tell
her
said
conrad
suspiciously
certainly
not
said
ben
indignantly
what
do
you
take
me
for
some
fellows
would
to
set
aunt
hamilton
against
me
i
am
not
so
mean
as
that
i
am
glad
i
can
depend
on
you
you
see
the
old
lady
is
awfully
rich
does
know
what
to
do
with
her
money
and
as
she
has
no
son
or
anybody
nearer
than
me
and
mother
it
natural
we
should
inherit
her
money
i
hope
she
will
enjoy
it
herself
for
a
good
many
years
oh
she
getting
old
said
conrad
carelessly
she
ca
expect
to
live
forever
it
would
be
fair
for
young
people
if
their
parents
lived
to
a
hundred
now
would
it
i
should
be
very
glad
to
have
my
mother
live
to
a
hundred
if
she
could
enjoy
life
said
ben
disgusted
with
his
companoin
sordid
selfishness
your
mother
has
got
any
money
and
that
makes
a
difference
ben
had
a
reply
but
he
reflected
it
would
be
of
little
use
to
argue
with
one
who
took
such
widely
different
views
as
conrad
moreover
they
were
already
within
a
block
or
two
of
the
theater
the
best
seats
were
priced
at
a
dollar
and
a
half
and
hamilton
had
given
conrad
three
dollars
to
purchase
one
for
ben
and
one
for
himself
it
seems
an
awful
price
to
pay
a
dollar
and
a
half
for
a
seat
said
conrad
suppose
we
go
into
the
gallery
where
the
seats
are
only
fifty
cents
i
think
hamilton
meant
us
to
take
seats
she
wo
care
or
know
unless
we
choose
to
tell
her
then
you
do
propose
to
give
her
back
the
difference
you
do
take
me
for
a
fool
do
you
i
tell
you
what
i
do
if
you
do
mind
a
seat
i
give
you
cents
out
of
this
money
ben
could
hardly
believe
conrad
was
in
earnest
in
this
exhibition
of
meanness
then
said
he
you
would
clear
cents
on
my
seat
and
a
dollar
on
your
own
you
can
see
almost
as
well
in
the
gallery
said
conrad
i
give
you
fifty
cents
if
you
insist
upon
it
i
insist
upon
having
my
share
of
the
money
spent
for
a
seat
said
ben
contemptuously
you
can
sit
where
you
please
of
course
you
ai
very
obliging
said
conrad
sullenly
i
need
the
money
and
that
what
made
me
propose
it
as
you
made
so
much
fuss
about
it
we
take
orchestra
seats
this
he
did
though
unwillingly
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
like
that
boy
thought
ben
he
a
little
too
mean
they
both
enjoyed
the
play
ben
perhaps
with
the
most
zest
for
he
had
never
before
attended
a
city
theater
at
eleven
the
curtain
fell
and
they
went
out
come
ben
said
conrad
you
might
treat
a
fellow
to
soda
water
i
will
answered
ben
where
shall
we
go
just
opposite
they
got
fine
soda
water
across
the
street
the
boys
drank
their
soda
water
and
started
to
go
home
suppose
we
go
in
somewhere
and
have
a
game
of
billiards
suggested
conrad
i
do
play
answered
ben
i
teach
you
come
along
urged
conrad
it
is
getting
late
and
i
would
rather
not
i
suppose
you
go
to
roost
with
the
chickens
in
the
country
sneered
conrad
you
learn
better
in
the
city
if
you
stay
there
is
another
reason
continued
ben
i
suppose
it
costs
money
to
play
billiards
and
i
have
none
to
spare
only
cents
a
game
it
will
be
cheaper
to
go
to
bed
you
wo
do
anything
a
fellow
wants
you
to
grumbled
conrad
you
need
be
so
mean
when
you
are
getting
ten
dollars
a
week
i
have
plenty
to
do
with
my
money
and
i
want
to
save
up
something
every
week
on
the
whole
the
boys
did
not
take
to
each
other
they
took
very
different
views
of
life
and
duty
and
there
seemed
to
be
small
prospect
of
their
becoming
intimate
friends
hamilton
had
gone
to
bed
when
they
returned
but
hill
was
up
watching
for
her
son
she
was
a
cold
disagreeable
woman
but
she
was
devoted
to
her
boy
i
am
glad
you
have
come
home
so
soon
she
said
i
wanted
to
play
a
game
of
billiards
but
ben
would
grumbled
conrad
if
you
had
done
so
i
should
have
had
to
sit
up
later
for
you
conrad
there
was
no
use
in
sitting
up
for
me
i
ai
a
baby
responded
conrad
ungratefully
you
know
i
ca
sleep
when
i
know
you
are
out
conrad
then
you
very
foolish
is
she
ben
my
mother
would
feel
just
so
answered
ben
hill
regarded
him
almost
kindly
he
had
done
her
a
good
turn
in
bringing
her
son
home
in
good
season
she
may
be
a
disagreeable
woman
thought
ben
but
she
is
good
to
conrad
and
this
made
him
regard
the
housekeeper
with
more
favor
chapter
xxii
a
mysterious
letter
from
time
to
time
hamilton
sent
ben
on
errands
to
different
parts
of
the
city
chiefly
to
those
who
had
been
started
in
business
with
capital
which
she
had
supplied
one
afternoon
he
was
sent
to
a
tailor
on
sixth
avenue
with
a
note
the
contents
of
which
were
unknown
to
him
you
may
wait
for
an
answer
said
hamilton
he
readily
found
the
tailor
shop
and
called
for
charles
roberts
the
proprietor
the
latter
read
the
note
and
said
in
a
business
like
tone
come
to
the
back
part
of
the
shop
and
i
will
show
you
some
goods
ben
regarded
him
in
surprise
is
there
some
mistake
he
said
i
did
know
i
was
to
look
at
any
goods
as
we
are
to
make
a
suit
for
you
i
supposed
you
would
have
some
choice
in
the
matter
returned
the
tailor
equally
surprised
may
i
look
at
the
letter
asked
ben
the
tailor
put
it
into
his
hands
it
ran
thus
roberts
you
will
make
a
suit
for
the
bearer
from
any
goods
he
may
select
and
charge
to
the
account
of
helen
hamilton
hamilton
did
not
tell
me
what
was
in
the
note
said
ben
smiling
she
is
very
kind
ben
allowed
himself
to
be
guided
by
the
tailor
and
the
result
was
a
handsome
suit
which
was
sent
home
in
due
time
and
immediately
attracted
the
attention
of
conrad
ben
had
privately
thanked
his
patroness
but
had
felt
under
no
obligation
to
tell
conrad
seems
to
me
you
are
getting
extravagant
said
conrad
enviously
i
do
know
but
i
am
answered
ben
how
much
did
you
pay
for
it
the
price
was
dollars
that
too
much
for
a
boy
in
your
circumstances
to
pay
i
think
so
myself
but
i
shall
make
it
last
a
long
time
i
mean
to
make
aunt
hamilton
buy
me
a
new
suit
grumbled
conrad
i
have
no
objection
i
am
sure
said
ben
i
did
ask
your
permission
said
conrad
rudely
i
wonder
what
he
would
say
if
he
knew
that
hamilton
paid
for
my
suit
ben
said
to
himself
he
wisely
decided
to
keep
the
matter
secret
as
he
knew
that
conrad
would
be
provoked
to
hear
of
this
new
proof
of
his
relative
partiality
for
the
boy
whom
he
regarded
as
a
rival
conrad
lost
no
time
in
preferring
his
request
to
hamilton
for
a
new
suit
i
bought
you
a
suit
two
months
since
said
hamilton
quietly
why
do
you
come
to
me
for
another
so
soon
ben
has
a
new
suit
answered
conrad
a
little
confused
i
do
know
that
that
has
anything
to
do
with
you
however
i
will
ask
ben
when
he
had
his
last
new
suit
ben
who
was
present
replied
it
was
last
november
nearly
a
year
since
i
will
take
care
that
you
are
supplied
with
new
suits
as
often
as
ben
conrad
retired
from
the
presence
of
his
relative
much
disgusted
he
did
not
know
but
suspected
that
ben
was
indebted
to
hamilton
for
his
new
suit
and
although
this
did
not
interfere
with
a
liberal
provision
for
him
he
felt
unwilling
that
anyone
beside
himself
should
bask
in
the
favor
of
his
rich
relative
he
made
a
discovery
that
troubled
him
about
this
time
let
me
see
your
watch
ben
he
said
one
day
ben
took
out
the
watch
and
placed
it
in
his
hand
it
just
like
mine
said
conrad
after
a
critical
examination
is
it
yes
do
you
see
where
did
you
get
it
it
was
a
gift
answered
ben
from
my
aunt
it
was
given
me
by
mrs
hamilton
she
seems
to
be
very
kind
to
you
sneered
conrad
with
a
scowl
she
is
indeed
answered
ben
earnestly
you
played
your
cards
well
said
conrad
coarsely
i
do
understand
you
returned
ben
coldly
i
mean
that
knowing
her
to
be
rich
you
have
done
well
to
get
on
the
blind
side
of
her
i
ca
accept
the
compliment
if
you
mean
it
as
such
i
do
think
hamilton
has
any
blind
side
and
the
only
way
in
which
i
intend
to
commend
myself
to
her
favor
is
to
be
faithful
to
her
interests
oh
you
mighty
innocent
but
all
the
same
you
know
how
to
feather
your
own
nest
in
a
good
sense
i
hope
i
do
i
do
suppose
anyone
else
will
take
the
trouble
to
feather
it
for
me
i
think
honesty
and
fidelity
are
good
policy
do
you
i
do
pretend
to
be
an
angel
answered
conrad
sullenly
nor
i
said
ben
laughing
some
days
later
conrad
came
to
ben
one
day
looking
more
cordial
than
usual
ben
he
said
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
what
is
it
will
you
grant
it
i
want
to
know
first
what
it
is
lend
me
five
dollars
ben
stared
at
conrad
in
surprise
he
had
just
that
amount
after
sending
home
money
to
his
mother
but
he
intended
that
afternoon
to
deposit
three
dollars
of
it
in
the
savings
bank
feeling
that
he
ought
to
be
laying
up
money
while
he
was
so
favorably
situated
how
do
you
happen
to
be
short
of
money
he
asked
that
does
need
telling
i
have
only
four
dollars
a
week
pocket
money
and
i
am
pinched
all
the
time
then
supposing
i
lent
you
the
money
how
could
you
manage
to
pay
me
back
out
of
this
small
allowance
oh
i
expect
to
get
some
money
in
another
way
but
i
can
not
unless
you
lend
me
the
money
would
you
mind
telling
me
how
why
the
fact
is
a
fellow
i
know
that
is
i
have
heard
of
him
has
just
drawn
a
prize
of
a
thousand
dollars
in
a
havana
lottery
all
he
paid
for
his
ticket
was
five
dollars
and
is
this
the
way
you
expect
to
make
some
money
yes
i
am
almost
sure
of
winning
suppose
you
do
oh
what
the
use
of
looking
at
the
dark
side
you
are
not
so
sensible
as
i
thought
conrad
said
ben
at
least
a
hundred
draw
a
blank
to
one
who
draws
a
small
prize
and
the
chances
are
a
hundred
to
one
against
you
then
you
wo
lend
me
the
money
said
conrad
angrily
i
would
rather
not
then
you
a
mean
fellow
thank
you
for
your
good
opinion
but
i
wo
change
my
determination
you
get
ten
dollars
a
week
i
shall
not
spend
two
dollars
a
week
on
my
own
amusement
or
for
my
own
purposes
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
rest
then
part
i
shall
send
to
my
mother
part
i
mean
to
put
in
some
savings
bank
you
mean
to
be
a
miser
then
if
to
save
money
makes
one
a
miser
then
i
shall
be
one
conrad
left
the
room
in
an
angry
mood
he
was
one
with
whom
prosperity
did
agree
whatever
his
allowance
might
be
he
wished
to
spend
more
looking
upon
himself
as
hamilton
heir
he
could
not
understand
the
need
or
expediency
of
saving
money
he
was
not
wholly
to
blame
for
this
as
his
mother
encouraged
him
in
hopes
which
had
no
basis
except
in
his
own
and
her
wishes
not
quite
three
weeks
after
ben
had
become
established
his
new
home
he
received
a
letter
which
mystified
and
excited
him
it
ran
thus
if
you
will
come
at
nine
this
evening
to
no
west
street
and
call
for
me
you
will
hear
something
to
your
advantage
james
barnes
it
may
be
something
relating
to
my
father
affairs
thought
ben
i
will
go
chapter
xxiii
ben
visit
to
street
ben
evenings
being
unoccupied
he
had
no
difficulty
in
meeting
the
appointment
made
for
him
he
was
afraid
conrad
might
ask
him
to
accompany
him
somewhere
and
thus
involve
the
necessity
of
an
explanation
which
he
did
not
care
to
give
until
he
had
himself
found
out
why
he
had
been
summoned
the
address
given
by
james
barnes
was
easy
to
find
ben
found
himself
standing
before
a
brick
building
of
no
uncommon
exterior
the
second
floor
seemed
to
be
lighted
up
the
windows
were
hung
with
crimson
curtains
which
quite
shut
out
a
view
of
what
was
transpiring
within
ben
rang
the
bell
the
door
was
opened
by
a
colored
servant
who
looked
at
the
boy
inquiringly
is
barnes
within
asked
ben
i
do
know
the
gentleman
was
the
answer
he
sent
me
a
letter
asking
me
to
meet
him
here
at
nine
then
i
guess
it
all
right
are
you
a
telegraph
boy
no
answered
ben
in
surprise
i
reckon
it
all
right
said
the
negro
rather
to
himself
than
to
ben
come
upstairs
ben
followed
his
guide
and
at
the
first
landing
a
door
was
thrown
open
mechanically
ben
followed
the
servant
into
the
room
but
he
had
not
made
half
a
dozen
steps
when
he
looked
around
in
surprise
and
bewilderment
novice
as
he
was
a
glance
satisfied
him
that
he
was
in
a
gambling
house
the
double
room
was
covered
with
a
soft
thick
carpet
chandeliers
depended
from
the
ceiling
frequent
mirrors
reflecting
the
brilliant
lights
enlarged
the
apparent
size
the
apartment
and
a
showy
bar
at
one
end
of
the
room
held
forth
an
alluring
invitation
which
most
failed
to
resist
around
tables
were
congregated
men
young
and
old
each
with
an
intent
look
watching
the
varying
chances
of
fortune
i
inquire
if
barnes
is
here
said
peter
the
colored
servant
ben
stood
uneasily
looking
at
the
scene
till
peter
came
back
must
be
some
mistake
he
said
there
no
gentleman
of
the
name
of
barnes
here
it
strange
said
ben
perplexed
he
turned
to
go
out
but
was
interrupted
a
man
with
a
sinister
expression
and
the
muscle
of
a
prize
fighter
walked
up
to
him
and
said
with
a
scowl
what
brings
you
here
kid
i
received
a
letter
from
barnes
appointing
to
meet
me
here
i
believe
you
are
lying
no
such
man
comes
here
i
never
lie
exclaimed
ben
indignantly
have
you
got
that
letter
about
you
asked
the
man
suspiciously
ben
felt
in
his
pocket
for
the
letter
but
felt
in
vain
i
think
i
must
have
left
it
at
home
he
said
nervously
the
man
face
darkened
i
believe
you
come
here
as
a
spy
he
said
then
you
are
mistaken
said
ben
looking
him
fearlessly
in
the
face
i
hope
so
for
your
sake
do
you
know
what
kind
of
a
place
this
is
i
suppose
it
is
a
gambling
house
ben
answered
without
hesitation
did
you
know
this
before
you
came
here
i
had
not
the
least
idea
of
it
the
man
regarded
him
suspiciously
but
no
one
could
look
into
honest
face
and
doubt
his
word
at
any
rate
you
found
it
out
do
you
mean
to
blab
no
that
is
no
business
of
mine
then
you
can
go
but
take
care
that
you
never
come
here
again
i
certainly
never
will
give
me
your
name
and
address
why
do
you
want
it
because
if
you
break
your
word
you
will
be
tracked
and
punished
i
have
no
fear
answered
ben
and
he
gave
his
name
and
address
never
admit
this
boy
again
peter
said
the
man
with
whom
ben
had
been
conversing
neither
this
boy
nor
any
other
except
a
telegraph
boy
all
right
sah
a
minute
later
ben
found
himself
on
the
street
very
much
perplexed
by
the
events
of
the
evening
who
could
have
invited
him
to
a
gambling
house
and
with
what
object
in
view
moreover
why
had
not
james
barnes
kept
the
appointment
he
had
himself
made
these
were
questions
which
ben
might
have
been
better
able
to
answer
if
he
could
have
seen
just
around
the
corner
the
triumphant
look
of
one
who
was
stealthily
watching
him
this
person
was
conrad
hill
who
took
care
to
vacate
his
position
before
ben
had
reached
the
place
where
he
was
standing
so
far
so
good
he
muttered
to
himself
master
ben
has
been
seen
coming
out
of
a
gambling
house
that
wo
be
likely
to
recommend
him
to
hamilton
and
she
shall
know
it
before
long
ben
could
not
understand
what
had
become
of
the
note
summoning
him
to
the
gambling
house
in
fact
he
had
dislodged
it
from
the
vest
pocket
in
which
he
thrust
it
and
it
had
fallen
upon
the
carpet
near
the
desk
in
what
hamilton
called
her
office
having
occasion
to
enter
the
room
in
the
evening
his
patroness
saw
it
on
the
carpet
picked
it
up
and
read
it
not
without
surprise
this
is
a
strange
note
for
ben
to
receive
she
said
to
herself
i
wonder
what
it
means
of
course
she
had
no
idea
of
the
character
of
the
place
indicated
but
was
inclined
to
hope
that
some
good
luck
was
really
in
store
for
her
young
secretary
he
will
be
likely
to
tell
me
sooner
or
later
she
said
to
herself
i
will
wait
patiently
and
let
him
choose
his
own
time
meanwhile
i
will
keep
the
note
hamilton
did
not
see
ben
till
the
next
morning
then
he
looked
thoughtful
but
said
nothing
he
was
puzzling
himself
over
what
had
happened
he
hardly
knew
whether
to
conclude
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
trick
or
that
the
note
was
written
in
good
faith
i
do
understand
why
the
writer
should
have
appointed
to
meet
me
at
such
a
place
he
reflected
i
may
hear
from
him
again
it
was
this
reflection
which
led
him
to
keep
the
matter
secret
from
hamilton
to
whom
be
had
been
tempted
to
speak
i
will
wait
till
i
know
more
he
said
to
himself
this
barnes
knows
my
address
and
he
can
communicate
with
me
if
he
chooses
of
course
the
reader
understands
that
conrad
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
trick
and
that
the
object
was
to
persuade
hamilton
that
the
boy
she
trusted
was
in
the
habit
of
visiting
gambling
houses
the
plan
had
been
suggested
by
conrad
and
the
details
agreed
on
by
him
and
his
mother
this
explains
why
conrad
was
so
conveniently
near
at
hand
to
see
ben
coming
out
of
the
gambling
house
the
boy
reported
the
success
of
this
plan
to
his
mother
i
never
saw
a
boy
look
so
puzzled
he
said
with
a
chuckle
when
he
came
out
of
the
gambling
house
i
should
like
to
know
what
sort
of
time
he
had
there
i
expected
he
would
get
kicked
out
i
feel
no
interest
in
that
matter
said
his
mother
i
am
more
interested
to
know
what
cousin
hamilton
will
say
when
she
finds
where
her
model
boy
has
been
she
give
him
his
walking
ticket
i
hope
she
ought
to
but
she
seems
so
infatuated
with
him
that
there
is
no
telling
when
shall
you
tell
her
mother
i
will
wait
a
day
or
two
i
want
to
manage
matters
so
as
not
to
arouse
any
suspicion
chapter
xxiv
ben
on
trial
excuse
my
intrusion
cousin
hamilton
i
see
you
are
engaged
the
speaker
was
hill
and
the
person
addressed
was
her
wealthy
cousin
it
was
two
days
after
the
event
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
i
am
only
writing
a
note
about
which
there
is
no
haste
did
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
hamilton
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
waited
to
hear
what
hill
had
to
say
there
was
very
little
similarity
between
the
two
ladies
one
was
stout
with
a
pleasant
benevolent
face
to
whom
not
only
children
but
older
people
were
irresistibly
attracted
the
other
was
thin
with
cold
gray
eyes
a
mouth
thin
lips
who
had
never
succeeded
in
winning
the
affection
of
anyone
true
she
had
married
but
her
husband
was
attracted
by
a
small
sum
of
money
which
she
possessed
and
which
had
been
reported
to
him
as
much
larger
than
it
really
was
when
asked
if
she
wished
to
speak
hill
coughed
there
a
matter
i
think
i
ought
to
speak
of
she
said
but
it
is
painful
for
me
to
do
so
why
is
it
painful
asked
hamilton
eyeing
her
steadily
because
my
motives
may
be
misconstrued
then
i
fear
it
will
give
you
pain
pain
is
sometimes
salutary
has
conrad
displeased
you
no
indeed
answered
hill
half
indignantly
my
boy
is
a
great
comfort
to
me
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
said
hamilton
dryly
for
her
own
part
hamilton
thought
her
cousin
son
one
of
the
least
attractive
young
people
she
had
ever
met
and
save
for
a
feeling
of
pity
and
the
slight
claims
of
relationship
would
not
have
been
willing
to
keep
him
in
the
house
i
do
see
why
you
should
have
judged
so
ill
of
my
poor
conrad
complained
hill
i
am
glad
you
are
so
well
pleased
with
him
let
me
know
what
you
have
to
communicate
it
is
something
about
the
new
boy
benjamin
hamilton
lifted
her
eyebrows
slightly
speak
without
hesitation
she
said
you
will
be
sure
not
to
misjudge
me
why
should
i
you
might
think
i
was
jealous
on
account
of
my
own
boy
there
is
no
occasion
for
you
to
be
jealous
no
of
course
not
i
am
sure
conrad
and
i
have
abundant
cause
to
be
grateful
to
you
that
is
not
telling
me
what
you
came
to
tell
said
hamilton
impatiently
i
am
afraid
you
are
deceived
in
the
boy
cousin
hamilton
in
what
respect
i
am
almost
sorry
i
had
not
kept
the
matter
secret
if
i
did
not
consider
it
my
duty
to
you
i
would
have
done
so
be
kind
enough
to
speak
at
once
you
need
not
apologize
nor
hesitate
on
my
account
what
has
ben
been
doing
on
tuesday
evening
he
was
seen
coming
out
of
a
gambling
house
who
saw
him
conrad
how
did
conrad
know
that
it
was
a
gambling
house
he
had
had
it
pointed
out
to
him
as
such
hill
answered
with
some
hesitation
about
what
time
was
this
a
little
after
nine
in
the
evening
and
where
was
the
gambling
house
situated
on
street
a
peculiar
look
came
over
hamilton
face
and
conrad
reported
this
to
you
the
same
evening
that
was
tuesday
yes
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
tell
you
immediately
because
i
did
not
want
to
injure
the
boy
you
are
more
considerate
than
i
should
have
expected
i
hope
i
am
i
do
pretend
to
like
the
boy
he
seems
to
have
something
sly
and
underhand
about
him
still
he
needs
to
be
employed
and
that
made
me
pause
till
your
sense
of
duty
to
me
overcame
your
reluctance
exactly
so
cousin
hamilton
i
am
glad
you
understand
so
well
how
i
feel
about
the
matter
hill
was
quite
incapable
of
understanding
the
irony
of
her
cousin
last
remark
and
was
inclined
to
be
well
pleased
with
the
reception
her
news
had
met
with
where
is
conrad
he
is
not
in
the
house
he
did
want
me
to
tell
you
that
speaks
well
for
him
i
must
speak
to
ben
on
the
subject
she
rang
the
bell
and
a
servant
appeared
see
if
master
ben
is
in
his
room
said
the
lady
if
so
ask
him
to
come
here
for
five
minutes
ben
was
in
the
house
and
in
less
than
two
minutes
he
entered
the
room
he
glanced
from
one
lady
to
the
other
in
some
surprise
hamilton
wore
her
ordinary
manner
but
hill
mouth
was
more
pursed
up
than
ever
she
looked
straight
before
her
and
did
not
look
at
ben
at
all
ben
said
hamilton
coming
to
the
point
at
once
did
you
visit
a
gambling
house
in
street
on
tuesday
evening
i
did
answered
ben
promptly
hill
moved
her
hands
slightly
and
looked
you
must
have
had
some
good
reason
for
doing
so
i
take
it
for
granted
you
did
not
go
there
to
gamble
no
answered
ben
with
a
smile
that
is
not
in
my
line
what
other
purpose
could
he
have
had
cousin
hamilton
put
in
hill
maliciously
ben
eyed
her
curiously
did
hill
tell
you
i
went
there
he
asked
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
do
so
said
that
lady
with
acerbity
i
dislike
to
see
my
cousin
so
deceived
and
imposed
upon
by
one
she
had
befriended
how
did
you
know
i
went
there
mrs
hill
conrad
saw
you
coming
out
of
the
gambling
house
i
did
see
him
it
was
curious
he
happened
be
in
that
neighborhood
just
at
that
time
said
ben
significantly
if
you
mean
to
insinuate
that
conrad
goes
to
such
places
you
are
quite
mistaken
said
hill
sharply
it
was
not
that
i
meant
to
insinuate
at
all
you
have
not
yet
told
me
why
you
went
there
ben
said
hamilton
mildly
because
i
received
a
mysterious
letter
signed
james
barnes
asking
me
to
come
to
that
address
about
nine
in
the
evening
i
was
told
i
would
hear
something
of
advantage
to
myself
did
you
meet
any
such
man
there
asked
hill
no
have
you
got
the
letter
you
speak
of
asked
hamilton
no
answered
ben
i
must
have
dropped
it
somewhere
i
felt
in
my
pocket
for
it
when
i
reached
the
gambling
house
but
it
was
gone
hill
looked
fairly
triumphant
a
very
queer
story
she
said
nodding
her
head
i
do
believe
you
received
any
such
letter
i
presume
you
had
often
been
to
the
same
place
to
misspend
your
evenings
do
you
think
so
mrs
hamilton
inquired
ben
anxiously
it
is
a
pity
you
lost
that
letter
ben
yes
it
is
answered
ben
regretfully
hill
said
hamilton
if
you
will
withdraw
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
to
ben
in
private
certainly
cousin
hamilton
returned
the
poor
cousin
with
alacrity
i
think
his
race
is
about
run
she
said
to
herself
in
a
tone
of
congratulation
chapter
xxv
conrad
takes
a
bold
step
i
hope
hamilton
you
do
suspect
me
of
frequenting
gambling
houses
said
ben
after
his
enemy
had
left
the
room
no
answered
hamilton
promptly
i
think
i
know
you
too
well
for
that
i
did
go
on
tuesday
evening
i
admit
continued
ben
i
saw
that
hill
did
not
believe
it
but
it
true
i
wish
i
had
lost
the
letter
inviting
me
there
you
might
think
i
had
invented
the
story
but
i
do
ben
and
for
the
best
of
all
reasons
because
i
found
the
note
on
the
carpet
and
have
it
in
my
possession
now
have
you
exclaimed
ben
gladly
here
it
is
said
the
lady
as
she
produced
the
note
from
the
desk
before
her
it
is
singular
such
a
note
should
have
been
sent
you
she
added
thoughtfully
i
think
so
too
i
had
no
suspicion
when
i
received
it
but
i
think
now
that
it
was
written
to
get
to
into
a
scrape
then
it
must
have
been
written
by
an
enemy
do
you
know
of
anyone
who
would
feel
like
doing
you
a
bad
turn
no
answered
ben
shaking
his
head
do
you
recognize
the
handwriting
no
it
may
have
been
written
by
some
person
i
know
but
i
have
no
suspicion
and
no
clew
as
to
who
it
is
i
think
we
will
let
the
matter
rest
for
a
short
time
if
we
say
nothing
about
it
the
guilty
person
may
betray
himself
you
are
very
kind
to
keep
your
confidence
in
me
hamilton
said
ben
gratefully
i
trust
you
as
much
as
ever
ben
but
i
shall
appear
not
to
for
a
time
ben
looked
puzzled
i
wo
explain
myself
said
hamilton
with
a
smile
but
i
intend
to
treat
you
coolly
for
a
time
as
if
you
had
incurred
my
displeasure
you
need
not
feel
sensitive
however
but
may
consider
that
i
am
acting
then
it
may
be
as
well
for
me
to
act
too
suggested
ben
a
good
suggestion
you
will
do
well
to
look
sober
and
uneasy
i
will
do
my
best
answered
ben
brightly
the
programme
was
carried
out
to
the
great
delight
of
hill
and
conrad
hamilton
scarcely
addressed
a
word
to
ben
at
the
supper
table
when
she
did
speak
it
was
with
an
abruptness
and
coldness
quite
unusual
for
the
woman
ben
looked
depressed
fixed
his
eyes
on
his
plate
and
took
very
little
part
in
the
conversation
hill
and
conrad
on
the
other
hand
seemed
in
very
good
spirits
they
chatted
cheerfully
and
addressed
an
occasional
word
to
ben
they
could
afford
to
be
magnanimous
feeling
that
he
had
forfeited
their
rich
cousin
favor
after
supper
conrad
went
into
his
mother
room
our
plan
working
well
mother
he
said
rubbing
his
hands
yes
conrad
it
is
cousin
hamilton
is
very
angry
with
the
boy
she
scarcely
spoke
a
word
to
him
he
wo
stay
long
i
be
bound
ca
you
suggest
mother
that
he
had
better
be
dismissed
at
once
no
conrad
we
have
done
all
that
is
needed
we
can
trust
cousin
hamilton
to
deal
with
him
she
will
probably
keep
him
for
a
short
time
till
she
can
get
along
without
his
services
it
lucky
he
lost
the
letter
cousin
hamilton
will
think
he
never
received
any
so
the
precious
pair
conferred
together
it
was
clear
that
ben
had
two
dangerous
and
unscrupulous
enemies
in
the
house
it
was
all
very
well
to
anticipate
revenge
upon
ben
and
his
summary
dismissal
but
this
did
not
relieve
conrad
from
his
pecuniary
embarrassments
as
a
general
thing
his
weekly
allowance
was
spent
by
the
middle
of
the
week
ben
had
refused
to
lend
money
and
there
was
no
one
else
he
could
call
upon
even
if
our
hero
was
dismissed
there
seemed
likely
to
be
no
improvement
in
this
respect
at
this
juncture
conrad
was
unfortunately
subjected
to
a
temptation
which
proved
too
strong
for
him
hamilton
was
the
possessor
of
an
elegant
opera
glass
which
she
had
bought
some
years
previous
in
paris
at
a
cost
of
fifty
dollars
generally
when
not
in
use
she
kept
it
locked
up
in
a
bureau
drawer
it
so
happened
however
that
it
had
been
left
out
on
a
return
from
a
matinee
and
lay
upon
her
desk
where
it
attracted
the
attention
of
conrad
it
was
an
unlucky
moment
for
he
felt
very
hard
up
he
wished
to
go
to
the
theater
in
the
evening
with
a
friend
but
had
no
money
it
flashed
upon
him
that
he
could
raise
a
considerable
sum
on
the
opera
glass
at
simpson
a
pawnbroker
on
the
bowery
and
he
could
without
much
loss
of
time
stop
there
on
his
way
down
to
business
scarcely
giving
himself
time
to
think
he
seized
the
glass
and
thrust
it
into
the
pocket
of
his
overcoat
then
putting
on
his
coat
he
hurried
from
the
house
arrived
at
the
pawnbroker
he
produced
the
glass
and
asked
how
much
will
you
give
me
on
this
the
attendant
looked
at
the
glass
and
then
at
conrad
this
is
a
very
valuable
glass
he
said
is
it
yours
no
answered
conrad
glibly
it
belongs
to
a
lady
in
reduced
circumstances
who
needs
to
raise
money
she
will
be
able
to
redeem
it
soon
did
she
send
you
here
yes
we
will
loan
you
twenty
dollars
on
it
will
that
be
satisfactory
quite
so
answered
conrad
quite
elated
at
the
sum
which
exceeded
his
anticipations
shall
we
make
out
the
ticket
to
you
or
the
lady
to
me
the
lady
does
not
like
to
have
her
name
appear
in
the
matter
this
is
so
frequently
the
case
that
the
statement
created
no
surprise
what
is
your
name
inquired
the
attendant
ben
barclay
answered
conrad
readily
the
ticket
was
made
out
the
money
paid
over
and
conrad
left
the
establishment
now
i
am
in
funds
he
said
to
himself
and
there
is
no
danger
of
detection
if
anything
is
ever
found
out
it
will
be
ben
who
will
be
in
trouble
not
i
it
was
not
long
before
hamilton
discovered
her
loss
she
valued
the
missing
opera
glass
for
reasons
which
need
not
be
mentioned
far
beyond
its
intrinsic
value
and
though
she
could
readily
have
supplied
its
place
so
far
as
money
was
concerned
she
would
not
have
been
as
well
pleased
with
any
new
glass
though
precisely
similar
as
with
the
one
she
had
used
for
years
she
remembered
that
she
had
not
replaced
the
glass
in
the
drawer
and
therefore
searched
for
it
wherever
she
thought
it
likely
to
have
been
left
but
in
vain
ben
she
said
have
you
seen
my
glass
anywhere
about
i
think
answered
ben
that
i
saw
it
on
your
desk
it
is
not
there
now
but
it
must
be
somewhere
in
the
house
she
next
asked
hill
the
housekeeper
was
entirely
ignorant
of
conrad
theft
and
answered
that
she
had
not
seen
it
i
ought
not
to
have
left
it
about
said
hamilton
it
may
have
proved
too
strong
a
temptation
to
some
one
of
the
servants
or
someone
else
suggested
hill
significantly
that
means
ben
thought
hamilton
but
she
did
not
say
so
i
would
ferret
out
the
matter
if
i
were
you
continued
hill
i
intend
to
answered
hamilton
quietly
i
valued
the
glass
far
beyond
its
cost
and
i
will
leave
no
means
untried
to
recover
it
you
are
quite
right
too
when
conrad
was
told
that
the
opera
glass
had
been
lost
he
said
probably
ben
stole
it
so
i
think
assented
his
mother
but
it
will
be
found
out
cousin
hamilton
has
put
the
matter
into
the
hands
of
a
detective
for
the
moment
conrad
felt
disturbed
but
he
quickly
recovered
himself
pshaw
they
ca
trace
it
to
me
he
thought
they
will
put
it
on
ben
chapter

lynx
the
detective
the
detective
who
presented
himself
to
hamilton
was
a
man
clad
in
a
brown
suit
except
that
his
eyes
were
keen
and
searching
his
appearance
was
disappointing
conrad
met
him
as
he
was
going
out
of
the
house
and
said
to
himself
contemptuously
he
looks
like
a
muff
i
have
sent
for
you
lynx
said
hamilton
to
see
if
you
can
help
me
in
a
matter
i
will
explain
to
you
and
then
she
gave
him
all
the
information
she
possessed
about
the
loss
of
the
opera
glass
how
valuable
was
the
glass
inquired
lynx
it
cost
fifty
dollars
in
paris
said
hamilton
but
you
set
a
higher
value
upon
it
for
other
reasons
just
so
you
are
right
will
you
favor
me
with
an
exact
description
of
the
article
said
the
detective
producing
his
notebook
hamilton
did
so
and
the
detective
made
an
entry
have
you
ever
had
anything
taken
out
of
your
house
by
outside
parties
he
asked
on
one
occasion
when
my
brother
was
visiting
me
his
overcoat
was
taken
from
the
hatstand
in
the
hall
a
sneak
thief
of
course
the
glass
however
was
not
so
exposed
no
it
was
not
on
the
lower
floor
at
all
it
looks
then
as
if
it
was
taken
by
someone
in
the
house
it
looks
so
said
hamilton
gravely
have
you
confidence
in
your
servants
or
rather
have
you
reason
to
suspect
any
of
them
i
believe
they
are
honest
i
do
believe
they
would
be
tempted
by
such
an
article
not
perhaps
for
their
own
use
but
a
glass
like
this
may
be
pawned
for
a
considerable
sum
being
of
peculiar
appearance
the
thief
would
be
hardly
likely
to
use
it
himself
or
herself
detection
would
be
too
sure
no
doubt
you
are
right
how
long
has
the
glass
been
missing
resumed
the
detective
three
days
no
doubt
it
has
been
pawned
by
this
time
your
course
is
clear
and
what
is
that
to
make
a
tour
of
the
pawnshops
and
ascertain
whether
such
an
article
has
been
brought
to
any
one
of
them
very
well
lynx
i
leave
the
matter
in
your
hands
i
trust
everything
to
your
judgment
thank
you
i
will
try
to
deserve
your
confidence
and
now
i
may
call
upon
you
lynx
left
the
presence
of
the
lady
and
went
downstairs
he
had
just
reached
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
when
a
thin
lady
glided
from
the
rear
of
the
hall
and
spoke
to
him
are
you
the
detective
summoned
by
mrs
hamilton
she
asked
yes
madam
answered
lynx
surveying
housekeeper
attentively
i
am
hill
the
housekeper
said
she
i
may
add
that
i
am
a
cousin
of
mrs
hamilton
lynx
bowed
and
waited
for
further
information
he
knew
who
was
addressing
him
for
he
had
questioned
hamilton
as
to
the
different
inmates
of
the
house
i
stopped
you
said
hill
because
i
have
my
suspicions
and
i
thought
i
might
help
you
in
this
investigation
i
shall
feel
indebted
to
you
for
any
help
you
can
afford
do
you
mind
telling
me
upon
what
your
suspicions
rest
i
do
like
to
accuse
or
throw
suspicions
on
anyone
said
the
housekeeper
but
i
think
it
is
my
duty
to
help
my
cousin
in
this
matter
undoubtedly
said
lynx
noticing
that
she
paused
proceed
you
may
or
may
not
be
aware
that
my
cousin
employs
a
boy
of
about
sixteen
whom
as
i
think
she
engaged
rather
rashly
without
knowing
anything
of
his
antecedents
he
assists
her
in
her
writing
and
accounts
in
fact
is
a
sort
of
secretary
his
name
is
benjamin
barclay
is
it
not
yes
do
you
know
anything
of
his
habits
he
is
very
plausible
in
fact
i
think
his
appearance
is
in
his
favor
but
i
think
he
is
sly
still
water
you
know
runs
deep
lynx
bowed
assent
i
was
disposed
proceeded
hill
artfully
to
think
well
of
the
boy
and
to
approve
my
cousin
selection
until
last
week
he
was
seen
leaving
a
gambling
house
in
street
indeed
that
is
certainly
suspicious
is
it
not
who
saw
him
leaving
the
gambling
house
mrs
hill
my
son
conrad
curious
that
he
should
have
been
near
at
the
time
he
was
taking
a
walk
he
generally
goes
out
in
the
evening
of
course
your
son
would
not
visit
such
a
place
certainly
not
answered
hill
looking
offended
at
the
suggestion
by
the
way
are
the
two
boys
intimate
do
they
seem
to
like
each
other
my
conrad
always
treats
the
other
boy
well
out
of
common
politeness
but
i
do
think
he
likes
him
very
well
is
your
son
in
any
situation
he
is
now
was
he
at
the
time
this
benjamin
was
engaged
by
mrs
hamilton
no
rather
singular
that
she
did
not
employ
your
son
instead
of
seeking
out
a
stranger
is
it
now
that
you
mention
it
i
confess
that
i
did
feel
hurt
at
the
slight
to
my
boy
however
i
do
wish
to
interfere
with
cousin
hamilton
or
obtrude
my
son
upon
her
strong
jealousy
there
thought
the
detective
so
you
think
this
ben
barclay
may
have
taken
the
glass
he
said
inquiringly
i
do
since
he
visits
gambling
houses
he
doubtless
squanders
money
and
can
find
a
market
for
more
than
he
can
honestly
earn
as
you
say
gambling
often
leads
to
dishonesty
does
hamilton
know
that
her
protege
visited
a
gambling
house
yes
mentioned
it
to
him
i
suppose
yes
of
course
he
denied
it
no
he
admitted
it
but
said
he
received
a
letter
from
a
stranger
appointing
to
meet
him
there
it
is
rather
curious
that
he
show
the
letter
however
he
pretended
he
had
lost
it
did
hamilton
believe
him
i
do
know
i
think
not
for
though
she
has
not
discharged
him
she
treats
him
very
coldly
have
you
any
further
information
to
give
me
no
i
hope
this
will
be
of
some
service
to
you
i
think
it
will
thank
you
and
there
i
prejudiced
him
against
ben
said
hill
to
herself
with
a
satisfied
smile
these
detectives
are
glad
of
a
hint
sharp
as
they
think
themselves
if
he
finds
out
that
it
is
ben
he
will
take
all
the
credit
to
himself
and
never
mention
me
in
the
matter
however
that
is
just
what
i
wish
it
is
important
that
i
should
not
appear
too
active
in
getting
the
boy
into
trouble
or
i
may
be
thought
to
be
influenced
by
interested
motives
though
heaven
knows
i
only
want
justice
for
myself
and
my
boy
the
sooner
we
get
this
boy
out
of
the
house
the
better
it
will
be
for
us
as
lynx
left
the
house
he
smiled
to
himself
that
woman
and
her
son
hate
ben
barclay
that
much
is
certain
and
look
upon
him
as
an
interloper
and
a
rival
i
rather
sympathize
with
the
poor
fellow
i
should
be
sorry
to
find
him
guilty
but
i
shall
not
stop
short
till
i
have
ferreted
out
the
truth
chapter
xxvii
the
telltale
ticket
conrad
still
had
the
pawnbroker
ticket
which
he
had
received
in
return
for
the
opera
glasses
and
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
with
it
he
did
intend
to
redeem
the
glass
and
if
found
in
his
possession
it
would
bring
him
under
suspicion
now
that
a
detective
had
the
matter
in
charge
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
would
be
well
to
have
the
ticket
found
in
ben
room
the
two
had
rooms
upon
the
same
floor
and
it
would
therefore
be
easy
to
slip
into
ben
chamber
and
leave
it
somewhere
about
now
it
chanced
that
susan
the
chambermaid
was
about
though
conrad
did
not
see
her
when
he
carried
out
his
purpose
and
instigated
by
curiosity
she
peeped
through
the
door
and
saw
him
place
the
ticket
on
the
bureau
wondering
what
it
was
she
entered
the
room
after
conrad
had
vacated
it
and
found
the
ticket
conrad
had
placed
there
susan
knew
what
a
pawnbroker
ticket
was
and
read
it
with
curiosity
she
saw
that
it
was
made
out
to
ben
barclay
how
then
did
master
conrad
get
hold
of
it
she
said
to
herself
it
my
belief
he
trying
to
get
master
ben
into
trouble
it
a
shame
it
is
for
master
ben
is
a
gentleman
and
he
is
between
the
two
boys
susan
favored
ben
who
always
treated
her
with
consideration
while
conrad
liked
to
order
about
the
servants
as
if
they
were
made
to
wait
upon
him
after
conrad
had
disposed
of
the
pawn
ticket
he
said
carelessly
to
his
mother
mother
if
i
were
you
i
look
into
ben
room
you
might
find
the
opera
glass
there
i
do
think
he
leave
it
there
he
would
pawn
it
then
you
might
find
the
ticket
somewhere
about
upon
this
hint
hill
went
up
to
ben
room
and
there
upon
the
bureau
she
naturally
found
the
ticket
i
thought
so
she
said
to
herself
conrad
was
right
the
boy
is
a
thief
here
is
the
ticket
made
out
to
him
by
name
well
well
brazen
enough
in
all
conscience
now
shall
i
show
it
to
cousin
hamilton
at
once
or
shall
i
wait
until
the
detective
has
reported
on
the
whole
hill
decided
to
wait
she
could
delay
with
safety
for
she
had
proof
which
would
utterly
crush
and
confound
the
hated
interloper
meanwhile
the
detective
pursued
his
investigations
of
course
he
visited
simpson
and
there
he
learned
that
the
opera
glass
which
he
readily
recognized
from
the
description
had
been
brought
there
a
few
days
previous
who
brought
it
he
asked
a
boy
of
about
sixteen
did
he
give
his
name
the
books
were
referred
to
and
the
attendant
answered
in
the
affirmative
he
gave
the
name
of
ben
barclay
he
answered
do
you
think
that
was
his
real
name
asked
the
detective
that
depends
on
whether
he
had
a
right
to
pawn
it
suppose
he
stole
it
then
probably
he
did
not
give
his
real
name
so
i
think
said
lynx
quietly
do
you
know
if
there
is
a
boy
by
that
name
there
is
but
i
doubt
if
he
knows
anything
about
the
matter
i
will
call
again
perhaps
he
added
i
must
report
to
my
principal
what
i
have
discovered
from
simpson
he
went
straight
to
hamilton
who
had
as
yet
received
no
communication
from
the
housekeeper
well
lynx
she
asked
with
interest
have
you
heard
anything
of
the
glass
i
have
seen
it
was
the
quiet
reply
where
at
a
pawnshop
on
the
bowery
did
you
learn
who
left
it
asked
hamilton
eagerly
a
boy
about
sixteen
years
of
age
who
gave
the
name
of
ben
barclay
i
ca
believe
ben
would
be
guilty
of
such
a
disgraceful
act
ejaculated
hamilton
deeply
moved
chapter
xxviii
hill
malice
at
this
moment
there
was
a
low
knock
on
the
door
come
in
said
hamilton
hill
the
housekeeper
glided
in
with
her
usual
stealthy
step
i
really
beg
pardon
for
intruding
she
said
with
a
slight
cough
but
i
thought
perhaps
i
might
throw
light
on
the
matter
lynx
is
investigating
well
said
the
detective
eying
her
attentively
i
had
occasion
to
go
into
ben
room
to
see
if
the
girl
had
put
things
in
order
when
my
attention
was
drawn
to
a
ticket
upon
the
bureau
you
can
tell
whether
it
is
of
importance
and
she
handed
it
with
an
air
of
deference
to
lynx
what
is
it
asked
hamilton
it
is
a
pawn
ticket
answered
lynx
attentively
let
me
see
it
please
hamilton
regarded
it
with
mingled
pain
and
incredulity
i
need
not
say
continued
the
housekeeper
that
i
was
surprised
and
saddened
at
this
evidence
of
the
boy
depravity
cousin
hamilton
has
been
so
kind
to
him
that
it
seems
like
the
height
of
ingratitude
may
i
ask
madam
said
lynx
if
your
suspicions
had
fastened
on
this
boy
ben
before
you
found
the
pawn
ticket
to
tell
the
truth
they
had
and
what
reason
had
you
for
forming
such
suspicions
i
knew
that
the
boy
frequented
gambling
houses
and
of
course
no
salary
however
large
would
be
sufficient
for
a
boy
with
such
habits
hamilton
did
not
speak
which
somewhat
embarrassed
hill
lynx
however
was
very
affable
and
thanked
her
for
her
assistance
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
assist
cousin
hamilton
said
she
though
i
am
sorry
for
that
ungrateful
boy
i
will
now
withdraw
and
leave
you
to
confer
together
hill
would
like
to
have
been
invited
to
remain
but
such
an
invitation
was
not
given
what
do
you
think
mr
lynx
asked
hamilton
i
think
your
housekeeper
does
not
like
ben
barclay
he
answered
dryly
and
you
do
think
him
guilty
she
asked
eagerly
no
the
boy
is
fool
enough
first
to
give
his
own
name
at
the
pawnbroker
and
next
to
leave
the
ticket
exposed
in
his
room
how
then
did
it
come
there
lynx
was
saved
the
trouble
of
answering
by
another
tap
on
the
door
who
is
it
now
he
said
he
stepped
to
the
door
and
opening
it
admitted
susan
what
is
it
susan
asked
hamilton
in
some
surprise
did
hill
bring
you
a
pawn
ticket
and
what
do
you
know
about
it
demanded
lynx
brusquely
and
did
she
say
she
found
it
on
master
ben
bureau
yes
susan
said
the
mistress
what
can
you
tell
us
about
it
i
can
tell
you
this
that
i
saw
master
conrad
steal
into
the
room
this
morning
and
put
it
there
with
his
own
hands
ha
this
is
something
to
the
purpose
said
the
detective
briskly
are
you
sure
of
this
susan
asked
hamilton
evidently
shocked
i
can
take
my
bible
oath
of
it
and
it
my
belief
that
tryin
to
get
master
ben
into
trouble
thank
you
susan
said
her
mistress
you
have
done
not
only
ben
but
myself
a
valuable
service
you
can
go
i
will
see
that
you
do
not
regret
it
do
tell
hill
that
i
told
you
or
she
be
my
enemy
for
life
i
will
see
to
that
as
susan
left
the
room
lynx
said
you
wo
require
my
services
any
longer
it
is
clear
enough
who
pawned
the
glass
you
mean
i
mean
the
boy
conrad
whose
mother
was
so
anxious
to
fix
the
guilt
upon
your
young
secretary
if
you
have
the
slightest
doubt
about
it
invite
the
young
gentleman
to
accompany
you
to
simpson
to
redeem
the
opera
glass

chapter
xxix
some
unexpected
changes
when
conrad
came
home
his
first
visit
was
to
his
mother
has
anything
been
found
out
about
the
stolen
opera
glass
he
asked
with
a
studied
air
of
indifference
i
should
say
there
had
she
answered
i
followed
the
clew
you
suggested
and
searched
the
boy
room
on
the
bureau
i
found
the
pawn
ticket
you
do
say
so
what
a
muff
ben
must
have
been
to
leave
it
around
so
carelessly
what
did
you
do
with
it
i
waited
till
lynx
was
conferring
with
cousin
hamilton
and
then
i
carried
it
in
and
gave
it
to
them
what
did
they
say
asked
conrad
eagerly
they
seemed
thunderstruck
and
lynx
very
politely
thanked
me
for
the
help
i
had
given
them
has
ben
been
bounced
yet
no
but
doubtless
he
will
be
very
soon
cousin
hamilton
does
want
to
think
him
a
thief
and
gambler
but
there
seems
no
way
of
escaping
from
such
a
mass
of
proof
i
should
say
not
do
you
think
she
told
ben
does
he
look
down
in
the
mouth
continued
conrad
i
have
seen
him
since
when
they
met
at
the
table
hamilton
manner
toward
ben
was
decidedly
frigid
as
conrad
and
his
mother
saw
much
to
their
satisfaction
ben
looked
sober
but
his
appetite
did
not
appear
to
be
affected
your
course
is
about
run
young
man
thought
hill
i
should
like
to
see
you
after
supper
conrad
said
hamilton
come
into
my
sitting
room
i
wonder
if
she
is
going
to
give
me
ben
place
thought
conrad
hardly
knowing
whether
he
wished
it
or
not
with
a
jaunty
air
and
a
smile
he
followed
hamilton
into
her
private
office
as
she
sometimes
called
it
shut
the
door
conrad
she
said
he
did
so
i
have
heard
news
of
the
opera
glass
she
commenced
mother
gave
me
a
hint
of
that
said
conrad
it
was
stolen
and
pawned
at
simpson
on
the
bowery
it
a
great
shame
said
conrad
thinking
that
a
safe
comment
to
make
yes
it
was
a
shame
and
a
disgrace
to
the
one
who
took
it
i
did
think
ben
would
do
such
a
thing
continued
conrad
growing
bolder
nor
i
said
hamilton
after
all
you
have
done
for
him
too
i
never
liked
the
boy
for
my
part
so
i
suspected
said
hamilton
dryly
however
i
will
tell
you
what
i
want
of
you
i
am
going
down
to
simpson
to
redeem
the
glass
and
want
you
to
go
with
me
you
want
me
to
go
with
you
ejaculated
conrad
turning
pale
yes
i
do
care
to
go
to
that
part
of
the
city
by
myself
and
i
will
take
you
to
keep
me
company
but
i
must
go
to
the
office
faltered
conrad
i
will
send
ben
to
say
that
you
ca
go
why
do
you
take
ben
to
simpson
or
the
detective
suggested
conrad
in
great
alarm
bethinking
himself
that
it
would
hardly
do
to
take
ben
since
the
attendant
would
certify
that
he
was
not
the
one
who
pawned
the
glass
because
i
prefer
to
take
you
have
you
any
objection
to
go
oh
no
of
course
not
answered
conrad
not
daring
to
make
any
further
objection
in
the
morning
hill
came
to
hamilton
and
said
poor
conrad
has
a
terrible
toothache
he
is
afraid
he
wo
be
able
to
go
with
you
to
simpson
will
you
kindly
excuse
him
hamilton
expected
some
such
excuse
i
will
take
ben
then
she
said
are
you
going
to
keep
that
boy
after
what
be
has
done
asked
the
housekeeper
it
is
inconvenient
for
me
to
part
with
him
just
yet
then
i
hope
you
will
excuse
the
suggestion
i
advise
you
to
keep
your
bureau
drawers
locked
i
think
it
best
myself
said
hamilton
is
conrad
toothache
very
bad
the
poor
fellow
is
in
great
pain
when
ben
was
invited
by
hamilton
to
go
to
the
pawnbroker
he
made
no
objection
it
is
only
fair
to
tell
you
ben
said
hamilton
that
the
person
who
pawned
the
opera
glass
gave
your
name
then
said
ben
i
should
like
to
know
who
it
is
i
think
i
know
said
his
patroness
but
when
we
redeem
the
glass
we
will
ask
for
a
description
of
him
an
hour
later
they
entered
the
pawnbroker
shop
hamilton
presented
the
ticket
and
made
herself
known
will
you
tell
me
she
asked
whether
you
have
ever
seen
the
young
gentleman
that
accompanies
me
not
to
my
knowledge
answered
the
attendant
after
attentively
regarding
ben
can
you
remember
the
appearance
of
the
boy
who
pawned
the
opera
glass
he
was
taller
than
this
boy
and
pale
he
was
thinner
also
his
hair
was
a
light
brown
a
light
dawned
upon
ben
and
his
glance
met
that
of
hamilton
so
that
she
read
his
suspicions
i
think
we
both
know
who
it
was
that
took
your
name
ben
she
said
but
for
the
present
i
wish
you
to
keep
it
secret
i
will
certainly
do
so
mrs
hamilton
i
am
placed
in
difficult
circumstances
and
have
not
made
up
my
mind
what
to
do
i
hope
you
wo
allow
yourself
to
be
prejudiced
against
me
by
any
false
stories
no
i
can
promise
you
that
i
have
perfect
confidence
in
you
thank
you
for
that
hamilton
said
ben
gratefully
yet
i
am
about
to
take
a
course
that
will
surprise
you
what
is
that
i
am
going
to
let
you
leave
me
for
a
time
and
put
conrad
in
your
place
ben
looked
bewildered
as
well
he
might
there
was
nothing
that
would
have
surprised
him
more
then
i
am
afraid
you
do
find
me
satisfactory
he
said
anxiously
why
not
you
discharge
me
from
your
service
no
answered
hamilton
smiling
i
have
other
work
for
you
to
do
i
mean
to
give
you
a
confidential
commission
ben
face
brightened
up
immediately
you
will
find
me
faithful
he
said
and
i
hope
i
may
repay
your
confidence
i
think
you
will
i
will
explain
matters
to
you
before
you
reach
the
house
as
i
do
want
hill
or
conrad
to
know
about
the
matter
indeed
for
reasons
of
my
own
i
shall
let
them
think
that
i
discharged
you
ben
smiled
he
was
not
averse
to
such
a
plan
and
now
for
the
business
i
own
a
farm
in
the
western
part
of
pennsylvania
i
have
for
years
let
it
for
a
nominal
sum
to
a
man
named
jackson
of
late
he
has
been
very
anxious
to
buy
it
and
has
offered
me
a
sum
greater
than
i
had
supposed
it
to
be
worth
as
i
know
him
to
be
a
man
who
has
tried
more
than
once
to
get
me
to
reduce
the
small
rent
i
charge
him
this
naturally
excites
my
curiosity
i
think
something
has
been
discovered
that
enhances
the
value
of
the
farm
and
if
so
i
want
to
know
it
you
are
a
boy
and
a
visit
to
the
neighborhood
will
not
excite
surprise
i
understand
said
ben
when
do
you
wish
me
to
start
this
afternoon
i
have
prepared
written
instructions
and
here
is
a
pocketbook
containing
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
for
expenses
shall
i
need
so
much
probably
not
but
i
wish
you
to
be
amply
provided
you
will
remove
all
your
things
from
my
house
but
you
may
store
anything
you
need
to
carry
when
conrad
heard
that
hamilton
had
taken
ben
with
her
he
was
alarmed
lest
it
should
be
discovered
that
the
boy
pawning
the
opera
glass
was
not
ben
but
himself
when
upon
hamilton
return
he
was
summoned
to
her
presence
he
entered
with
trepidation
is
your
toothache
better
conrad
asked
hamilton
a
little
better
thank
you
i
am
going
to
make
a
change
in
your
position
ben
is
to
leave
me
and
you
will
take
his
place
as
my
secretary
conrad
heart
bounded
with
joy
and
surprise
how
can
i
thank
you
cousin
hamilton
he
said
with
a
feeling
of
great
relief
by
serving
me
well
all
has
turned
out
for
the
best
mother
said
conrad
joyfully
as
he
sought

in

calmly
chapter

ben
goes
west
undisturbed
by
the
thought
that
his
departure
was
viewed
with
joy
by
conrad
and
his
mother
ben
set
out
on
his
western
journey
his
destination
was
centerville
in
western
pennsylvania
i
may
as
well
say
that
this
is
not
the
real
name
of
the
place
which
for
several
reasons
i
conceal
though
ben
was
not
an
experienced
traveler
he
found
no
difficulty
in
reaching
his
destination
having
purchased
a
copy
of
railway
guide
which
afforded
him
all
the
information
he
required
about
fifty
miles
this
side
of
centerville
he
had
for
a
seat
companion
a
man
of
middle
age
with
a
pleasant
face
covered
with
a
brown
beard
who
after
reading
through
a
philadelphia
paper
which
he
had
purchased
of
the
seemed
inclined
to
have
a
social
chat
with
ben
may
i
ask
your
destination
my
young
friend
he
asked
ben
felt
that
it
was
well
for
him
to
be
cautious
though
he
was
pleasantly
impressed
with
the
appearance
of
his
companion
i
think
i
shall
stop
over
at
centerville
he
said
indeed
that
is
my
destination
do
you
live
there
asked
ben
no
said
the
other
laughing
do
i
look
like
it
i
thought
you
would
read
york
in
my
face
and
manner
i
am
not
an
experienced
observer
said
ben
modestly
centerville
has
a
prosperous
future
before
it
said
the
stranger
has
it
i
do
know
much
about
the
place
i
never
was
there
you
know
of
course
that
it
is
in
the
oil
region
i
did
even
know
that
a
year
ago
resumed
the
stranger
it
was
a
humdrum
farming
town
and
not
a
very
prosperous
one
either
the
land
is
not
of
good
quality
and
the
farmers
found
it
hard
work
to
get
a
poor
living
now
all
is
changed
ben
attention
was
aroused
he
began
to
understand
why
jackson
wished
to
buy
the
farm
he
rented
from
hamilton
this
is
all
new
to
me
he
said
i
suppose
oil
has
been
found
there
yes
one
old
farm
which
would
have
been
dear
at
three
thousand
dollars
is
now
yielding
hundreds
of
barrels
daily
and
would
fetch
fifty
thousand
dollars
easily
ben
began
to
be
excited
if
he
could
only
sell
hamilton
farm
for
half
that
he
felt
that
he
would
be
doing
an
excellent
thing
i
suppose
you
are
interested
in
some
of
the
petroleum
wells
he
said
not
yet
but
i
hope
to
be
in
fact
i
do
mind
confessing
that
i
represent
a
new
york
syndicate
and
that
my
object
in
making
this
journey
is
to
purchase
if
i
can
the
jackson
farm
the
jackson
farm
repeated
ben
his
breath
almost
taken
away
by
his
surprise
yes
do
you
know
anything
about
it
asked
his
companion
i
have
heard
of
a
farmer
in
centerville
named
peter
jackson
that
is
the
man
and
his
farm
is
one
of
the
lucky
ones
then
it
promises
to
be
i
suppose
then
you
will
have
to
pay
a
large
sum
for
it
said
ben
trying
to
speak
calmly
jackson
is
very
coy
and
i
think
grasping
he
wants
fifty
thousand
dollars
of
course
you
wo
pay
so
much
i
should
hardly
feel
authorized
to
do
so
i
may
go
as
high
as
forty
thousand
dollars
ben
was
dazzled
if
he
could
effect
a
sale
at
this
price
he
would
be
doing
a
splendid
stroke
of
business
and
would
effectually
defeat
the
plans
of
jackson
who
it
appeared
had
pretended
that
he
was
the
owner
of
the
farm
hoping
to
obtain
it
from
hamilton
at
a
valuation
which
would
have
been
suitable
before
the
discovery
of
oil
but
now
would
be
ludicrously
disproportionate
to
its
real
value
shall
or
shall
i
not
tell
this
gentleman
the
truth
he
reflected
he
thought
over
the
matter
and
decided
to
do
so
the
discovery
must
be
made
sooner
or
later
and
there
would
be
no
advantage
in
delay
i
do
think
jackson
will
sell
he
said
why
not
asked
the
stranger
in
surprise
do
you
know
him
i
never
saw
him
in
my
life
then
how
can
you
form
any
opinion
on
the
subject
ben
smiled
the
answer
is
easy
enough
he
said
jackson
ca
sell
what
he
does
own
do
you
mean
to
say
that
he
is
not
the
owner
of
the
farm
which
he
proposes
to
sell
us
that
is
just
what
i
mean
he
is
no
more
the
owner
than
you
or
i
you
speak
confidently
young
man
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
who
is
the
owner
i
can
the
owner
is
hamilton
of
new
york
indeed
that
is
a
genuine
surprise
can
you
give
me
her
address
i
should
like
to
communicate
with
her
i
will
cheerfully
give
you
her
address
but
it
wo
be
necessary
for
i
represent
her
you
exclaimed
the
stranger
incredulously
yes
and
i
am
going
out
to
centerville
now
as
her
agent
this
jackson
who
is
her
tenant
has
been
urging
her
to
sell
him
the
farm
for
some
time
he
has
offered
a
sum
larger
than
the
farm
would
be
worth
but
for
the
discovery
of
petroleum
but
has
taken
good
care
not
to
speak
of
this
how
much
does
he
offer
five
thousand
dollars
the
rascal
he
offers
five
thousand
and
expects
us
to
pay
him
fifty
thousand
dollars
for
his
bargain
what
an
unmitigated
swindle
it
would
have
been
if
he
had
carried
out
his
scheme
perhaps
you
would
like
to
see
his
last
letter
said
ben
i
should
i
want
to
see
what
the
old
rascal
has
to
say
for
himself
ben
took
from
his
pocket
the
letter
in
question
and
put
it
into
the
hands
of
his
new
acquaintance
it
was
dated
at
centerville
october
it
was
written
in
a
cramped
hand
showing
that
the
farmer
was
not
accustomed
to
it
ran
thus
respected
madam
as
i
have
already
wrote
you
i
would
like
to
buy
the
farm
and
will
give
you
more
than
anybody
else
because
i
am
used
to
living
on
it
and
it
seems
like
home
i
am
willing
to
pay
five
thousand
dollars
though
i
know
it
is
only
worth
four
but
it
is
worth
more
to
me
than
to
others
i
offer
you
more
because
i
know
you
are
rich
and
will
not
sell
unless
you
get
a
good
bargain
please
answer
right
away
yours
respectfully
peter
jackson
my
offer
will
hold
good
for
only
two
weeks
he
seems
to
be
very
much
in
earnest
said
ben
he
has
reason
to
be
so
as
he
hopes
to
make
thousand
dollars
on
his
investment
he
will
be
bitterly
disappointed
said
ben
i
do
care
anything
about
jackson
said
the
stranger
i
would
just
as
soon
negotiate
with
you
are
you
authorized
to
sell
the
farm
no
answered
ben
but
hamilton
will
probably
be
guided
by
my
advice
in
the
mater
that
amounts
to
the
same
thing
i
offer
you
forty
thousand
dollars
for
it
i
think
favorably
of
your
proposal
my
name
is
taylor
taylor
but
i
prefer
to
delay
answering
till
i
am
on
the
ground
and
can
judge
better
of
the
matter
you
are
right
i
was
surprised
at
first
that
hamilton
should
have
selected
so
young
an
agent
i
begin
to
think
her
choice
was
a
judicious
one
chapter
xxxi
jackson
receives
a
call
suppose
we
join
forces
ben
said
taylor
familiarly
how
do
you
mean
we
will
join
forces
against
this
man
jackson
he
wants
to
swindle
both
of
us
that
is
those
whom
we
represent
i
am
willing
to
work
with
you
answered
ben
who
had
been
favorably
impressed
by
the
appearance
and
frankness
of
his
traveling
companion
then
suppose
morning
it
is
too
late
we
call
over
and
see
the
old
rascal
i
would
rather
not
have
him
know
on
what
errand
i
come
just
at
first
that
is
in
accordance
with
my
own
plans
you
will
go
as
my
companion
he
will
take
you
for
my
son
or
nephew
and
while
i
am
negotiating
you
can
watch
and
judge
for
yourself
i
like
the
plan
said
ben
when
he
finds
out
who
you
are
he
will
feel
pretty
badly
sold
he
deserves
it
the
two
put
up
at
a
country
hotel
which
though
not
luxurious
was
tolerably
comfortable
after
the
fatigue
of
his
journey
ben
enjoyed
a
good
supper
and
a
comfortable
bed
the
evening
however
he
spent
in
the
public
room
of
the
inn
where
he
had
a
chance
to
listen
to
the
conversation
of
a
motley
crowd
some
of
them
native
and
residents
others
strangers
who
had
been
drawn
to
centerville
by
the
oil
discoveries
i
tell
you
said
a
long
lank
individual
centerville
goin
to
be
one
of
the
smartest
places
in
the
united
states
it
got
a
big
future
before
it
that
so
said
a
small
wiry
man
but
i
not
so
much
interested
in
that
as
i
am
in
the
question
whether
or
not
i
got
a
big
future
before
me
you
one
of
the
owners
of
the
hoffman
farm
ai
you
yes
i
wish
i
owned
the
whole
of
it
still
i
made
nigh
on
to
a
thousand
dollars
durin
the
last
month
for
my
share
of
the
profits
pretty
fair
eh
i
should
say
so
you
got
a
good
purchase
but
there
one
better
in
my
opinion
where
that
peter
jackson
farm
here
ben
and
taylor
began
to
listen
with
interest
he
has
begun
to
work
it
any
has
he
not
much
just
enough
to
find
out
its
value
what
he
waitin
for
there
some
new
york
people
want
it
if
he
can
get
his
price
sell
it
to
them
for
a
good
sum
down
what
does
he
ask
he
wants
fifty
thousand
dollars
whew
that
rather
stiffish
i
thought
the
property
belonged
to
a
lady
in
new
york
so
it
did
but
jackson
says
he
bought
it
a
year
ago
he
was
lucky
ben
and
taylor
looked
at
each
other
again
it
was
easy
to
see
the
old
farmer
game
and
to
understand
why
he
was
so
anxious
to
secure
the
farm
out
of
which
he
could
make
so
large
a
sum
of
money
he
playing
a
deep
game
ben
said
taylor
when
they
had
left
the
room
yes
but
i
think
i
shall
be
able
to
put
a
spoke
in
his
wheel
i
shall
be
curious
to
see
how
he
takes
it
when
he
finds
the
negotiation
taken
out
of
his
hands
we
play
with
him
a
little
as
a
cat
plays
with
a
mouse
the
next
morning
after
a
substantial
breakfast
ben
and
his
new
friend
took
a
walk
to
the
farm
occupied
by
peter
jackson
it
was
about
half
a
mile
away
and
when
reached
gave
no
indication
of
the
wealth
it
was
capable
of
producing
the
farmhouse
was
a
plain
structure
nearly
forty
years
old
badly
in
need
of
paint
and
the
harmonized
with
it
in
appearance
a
little
way
from
the
house
was
a
tall
gaunt
man
engaged
in
mending
a
fence
he
was
dressed
in
a
farmer
blue
frock
and
overalls
and
his
gray
stubby
beard
seemed
to
be
of
a
week
growth
there
was
a
crafty
greedy
look
in
his
eyes
which
overlooked
a
nose
sharp
and
aquiline
his
feet
were
incased
in
a
pair
of
cowhide
boots
he
looked
inquiringly
at
taylor
as
he
approached
but
hardly
deigned
to
look
at
ben
who
probably
seemed
too
insignificant
to
notice
he
gave
a
shrewd
guess
at
the
errand
of
the
visitor
but
waited
for
him
to
speak
first
is
this
mr
jackson
asked
taylor
with
a
polite
bow
that
my
name
stranger
answered
the
old
man
my
name
is
taylor
i
wrote
to
you
last
week
i
got
the
letter
said
jackson
going
on
with
his
work
it
was
his
plan
not
to
seem
too
eager
but
to
fight
shy
in
order
to
get
his
price
besides
though
he
would
have
been
glad
to
close
the
bargain
on
the
spot
there
was
an
embarrassing
difficulty
the
farm
was
not
his
to
sell
and
he
was
anxiously
awaiting
hamilton
answer
to
his
proposal
she
ca
have
heard
of
the
oil
discoveries
he
thought
and
five
thousand
dollars
will
seem
a
big
price
for
the
farm
she
ca
help
agreeing
to
my
terms
this
consideration
made
him
hopeful
but
for
all
that
he
must
wait
and
waiting
he
found
very
tantalizing
have
you
decided
to
accept
my
offer
mr
jackson
waal
i
have
to
take
a
leetle
time
to
consider
how
much
did
you
say
you
give
forty
thousand
dollars
i
ought
to
have
fifty
forty
thousand
dollars
is
a
big
sum
of
money
and
this
farm
is
a
perfect
gold
mine
should
wonder
if
it
would
net
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
there
is
no
certainty
of
that
and
the
purchasers
will
have
to
take
a
big
risk
there
is
much
risk
ask
anybody
in
centerville
what
he
thinks
of
the
jackson
farm
suppose
i
were
ready
to
come
to
your
terms
mind
i
do
say
i
am
would
you
sign
the
papers
jackson
looked
perplexed
he
knew
could
not
do
it
what
your
hurry
he
said
the
capitalists
whom
i
represent
are
anxious
to
get
to
work
as
soon
as
possible
that
natural
is
it
answered
jackson
so
the
sooner
we
fix
matters
the
better
i
want
to
go
back
to
new
york
if
i
can
i
do
think
i
can
give
my
answer
as
soon
as
that
wait
a
minute
though
a
boy
was
approaching
jackson
son
if
one
could
judge
from
the
resemblance
holding
a
letter
in
his
hand
come
right
here
abner
he
called
out
eagerly
abner
approached
and
his
father
snatched
the
letter
from
his
hand
it
bore
the
new
york
postmark
but
on
opening
it
jackson
looked
bitterly
disappointed
he
had
hoped
it
was
from
hamilton
accepting
his
offer
for
the
farm
but
instead
of
that
it
was
an
unimportant
circular
i
have
to
take
time
to
think
over
your
offer
taylor
he
said
you
see
i
have
to
talk
over
matters
with
the
old
woman
by
the
way
said
taylor
carelessly
i
was
told
in
the
village
that
you
did
own
the
farm
that
it
was
owned
by
a
lady
in
new
york
she
used
to
own
it
said
the
fanner
uneasily
but
i
bought
it
of
her
a
year
ago
so
that
you
have
the
right
to
sell
it
of
course
i
have
what
have
you
to
say
to
that
ben
asked
taylor
quietly
that
if
hamilton
has
sold
the
farm
to
jackson
she
know
it
what
do
you
mean
boy
gasped
jackson
i
mean
that
when
i
left
new
york
hamilton
owned
the
farm
it
a
lie
muttered
the
farmer
but
he
spoke
with
difficulty
i
bought
it
a
year
ago
in
that
case
it
is
strange
that
you
should
have
written
a
week
ago
offering
five
thousand
dollars
for
the
farm
who
says
i
wrote
i
do
and
i
have
your
letter
in
my
pocket
answered
ben
firmly
chapter
xxxii
ben
sells
the
farm
the
farmer
stared
at
ben
he
had
thought
success
within
his
grasp
he
was
to
be
a
rich
man
independent
for
life
as
the
result
of
the
trick
which
he
was
playing
upon
hamilton
his
disappointment
was
intense
and
he
looked
the
picture
of
discomfiture
i
do
believe
you
he
faltered
after
a
pause
ben
drew
a
letter
from
his
inside
pocket
and
held
it
up
do
you
deny
the
writing
he
said
give
it
to
me
said
jackson
with
a
sudden
movement
no
thank
you
i
prefer
to
keep
it
i
shall
make
no
use
of
it
unless
it
is
necessary
i
called
here
to
notify
you
that
hamilton
does
not
propose
to
sacrifice
the
farm
if
it
is
sold
at
all
it
will
be
to
someone
who
will
pay
its
full
value
you
ca
sell
it
said
jackson
sullenly
i
have
a
lease
produce
it
at
any
rate
i
shall
stay
till
my
year
out
that
will
depend
upon
the
new
owner
if
he
is
willing
hamilton
will
not
object
i
think
you
got
him
there
ben
said
taylor
with
a
laugh
jackson
i
think
it
wo
be
worth
while
to
continue
our
conversation
you
undertook
to
sell
what
was
not
yours
i
prefer
to
deal
with
the
real
owner
or
her
representative
that
boy
is
an
impostor
muttered
jackson
why
he
only
a
school
boy
what
does
he
know
about
business
i
think
he
has
proved
a
match
for
you
jackson
ben
let
us
be
going
now
said
taylor
as
they
were
walking
toward
the
inn
what
do
you
say
to
my
offer
please
state
it
mr
taylor
i
offer
forty
thousand
dollars
for
the
farm
it
may
be
worth
considerably
more
than
that
but
on
the
other
hand
the
wells
may
soon
run
dry
i
have
to
take
the
chances
that
seems
a
fair
offer
taylor
said
ben
frankly
if
i
were
the
owner
i
would
accept
it
but
i
am
acting
for
another
who
may
not
think
as
i
do
will
you
consult
her
and
let
me
know
i
will
write
at
once
why
not
telegraph
the
delay
would
be
too
great
if
you
trust
to
the
mail
i
will
do
as
you
suggest
answered
ben
if
there
is
an
opportunity
to
telegraph
from
this
place
there
is
an
office
at
the
depot
then
i
will
take
that
on
my
way
back
to
the
hotel
at
one
corner
of
the
depot
ben
found
a
telegraph
operator
after
a
little
consideration
he
dashed
off
the
following
telegram
no
madison
avenue
new
york
to
hamilton
oil
has
been
discovered
on
your
farm
i
am
offered
forty
thousand
dollars
for
it
by
a
responsible
party
what
shall
i
do
ben
barclay
send
answer
to
the
hotel
said
ben
to
the
operator
four
hours
later
a
messenger
brought
to
ben
the
following
dispatch
your
news
is
most
surprising
sell
at
the
figure
named
if
you
think
it
best
you
have
full
powers
helen
hamilton
taylor
watched
ben
face
eagerly
as
he
read
the
telegram
for
he
knew
that
it
must
relate
to
his
offer
what
does
your
principal
say
he
inquired
you
can
read
the
telegram
mr
taylor
taylor
did
so
so
you
have
full
powers
he
said
hamilton
must
feel
great
confidence
in
you
there
was
a
proud
flush
on
ben
cheek
as
he
replied
i
have
reason
to
think
that
she
does
i
hope
it
is
not
misplaced
i
hope
you
wo
drive
a
hard
bargain
with
me
ben
i
do
mean
to
bargain
at
all
you
have
made
a
fair
offer
and
i
will
accept
it
taylor
looked
pleased
some
boys
in
your
position
he
said
would
have
stipulated
for
a
present
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
said
ben
promptly
i
should
not
think
it
honest
your
honesty
my
boy
is
of
the
kind
it
is
not
the
kind
now
in
vogue
i
like
you
the
better
for
it
and
if
you
were
not
in
hamilton
employ
i
would
try
to
secure
your
services
myself
thank
you
taylor
the
time
may
come
when
shall
remind
you
of
your
promise
you
will
find
i
have
not
forgotten
it
and
now
to
business
we
will
go
to
a
lawyer
and
have
the
necessary
papers
drawn
up
which
you
shall
sign
in
behalf
of
your
principal
the
business
was
speedily
arranged
and
by
ben
found
that
he
had
nothing
further
to
detain
him
in
centerville
he
felt
that
he
had
done
a
smart
stroke
of
business
hamilton
had
been
surprised
at
receiving
an
offer
of
five
thousand
dollars
for
the
farm
yet
he
had
sold
it
for
forty
thousand
as
they
were
returning
from
the
lawyer
office
they
met
farmer
jackson
just
returning
from
the
post
office
by
the
way
jackson
said
taylor
you
will
perhaps
be
interested
to
learn
that
your
farm
has
been
sold
the
farmer
paused
and
looked
troubled
are
you
going
to
turn
me
out
of
the
house
he
asked
not
if
you
wish
to
live
in
it
i
shall
employ
workmen
at
once
to
sink
wells
and
develop
the
property
they
will
need
to
board
somewhere
are
you
willing
to
board
them
yes
i
shall
be
glad
to
answered
jackson
i
am
a
poor
man
and
it
hard
work
living
by
farming
very
well
we
can
no
doubt
make
an
arrangement
i
am
obliged
to
go
to
new
york
to
complete
arrangements
for
the
transfer
of
the
property
but
i
shall
come
back
as
soon
as
possible
and
commence
operations
i
would
mind
workin
for
myself
said
jackson
then
you
are
the
first
man
i
engage
the
old
farmer
brightened
up
he
was
to
make
money
out
of
the
new
discoveries
after
all
though
not
in
the
way
he
had
comtemplated
when
are
you
going
back
to
new
york
ben
asked
taylor
there
is
nothing
to
detain
me
here
any
longer
we
can
go
back
together
then
i
shall
be
glad
to
travel
in
your
company
sir
do
you
expect
to
remain
in
hamilton
employ
i
do
know
answered
ben
what
were
you
doing
keeping
accounts
and
acting
as
her
private
secretary
do
you
like
it
yes
i
find
it
very
pleasant
or
would
be
but
for
one
thing
what
is
that
she
has
relatives
living
in
the
house
who
do
not
like
me
jealous
eh
perhaps
so
let
me
say
frankly
that
you
are
fitted
for
something
higher
i
am
a
good
judge
of
men
ben
smiled
boys
then
and
i
consider
you
a
boy
of
excellent
business
capacity
after
i
have
got
my
oil
wells
under
way
i
should
like
to
engage
you
as
superintendent
i
am
flattered
by
your
good
opinion
taylor
but
it
is
a
business
i
know
nothing
of
you
would
make
it
your
business
to
learn
it
or
i
mistake
you
you
are
right
there
sir
however
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
to
arrange
about
this
matter
it
would
probably
be
two
months
before
i
felt
justified
in
leaving
another
in
charge
the
two
started
for
new
york
about
fifty
miles
before
reaching
the
city
as
ben
was
reading
a
magazine
he
had
purchased
from
the
he
felt
a
touch
upon
his
shoulder
looking
up
he
recognized
to
his
amazement
the
tramp
with
whom
he
had
had
an
adventure
some
weeks
before
in
pentonville
i
see
you
know
me
said
the
tramp
with
a
smile
chapter
xxxiii
good
news
the
tramp
as
we
may
call
him
for
want
of
a
different
name
certainly
showed
signs
of
improvement
in
his
personal
appearance
he
looked
quite
respectable
in
fact
in
a
business
suit
of
gray
mixed
cloth
and
would
have
passed
muster
in
any
assemblage
i
think
i
have
met
you
before
answered
ben
with
a
smile
perhaps
it
would
have
been
more
of
a
compliment
not
to
have
recognized
me
i
flatter
myself
that
i
have
changed
so
you
have
and
for
the
better
thank
you
i
believe
we
rode
together
when
we
last
met
yes
said
ben
and
you
were
not
sorry
to
part
copy
with
me
is
it
not
so
i
wo
contradict
you
yet
i
am
inclined
to
be
your
friend
i
am
glad
of
it
said
ben
politely
though
truth
to
tell
he
did
not
anticipate
any
particular
benefit
to
accrue
from
the
acquaintance
of
the
speaker
i
see
you
do
attach
much
importance
to
my
offer
of
friendship
yet
i
can
do
you
an
important
service
taylor
who
had
been
occupying
a
seat
with
ben
here
arose
you
have
something
to
say
to
my
young
friend
he
said
take
my
seat
do
let
me
deprive
you
of
it
said
the
other
with
a
politeness
ben
had
not
deemed
him
capable
of
by
no
means
i
am
going
into
the
smoking
car
to
smoke
a
cigar
ben
i
will
be
back
soon
i
did
expect
to
meet
you
so
far
from
pentonville
said
ben
new
companion
unable
to
suppress
his
curiosity
i
do
live
in
pentonville
now
where
then
in
the
city
of
new
york
are
you
employed
there
yes
but
i
am
just
returning
from
a
trip
to
western
pennsylvania
did
you
go
on
business
yes
well
you
are
getting
on
for
a
country
boy
what
do
you
hear
from
home
my
mother
is
well
but
i
fancy
that
is
not
what
you
mean
yes
i
am
interested
about
your
mother
has
she
yet
paid
off
that
mortgage
on
her
cottage
how
did
you
know
there
was
a
mortgage
asked
ben
in
surprise
i
know
more
than
you
suppose
what
are
the
chances
that
she
will
be
able
to
pay
they
are
very
small
answered
ben
gravely
but
the
money
is
not
yet
due
when
will
it
be
due
in
about
six
weeks
squire
davenport
will
foreclose
i
know
him
well
enough
for
that
so
i
suppose
said
ben
soberly
is
there
no
friend
who
will
oblige
you
with
the
money
i
do
know
of
anyone
i
should
feel
at
liberty
to
call
on
it
came
into
his
mind
that
hamilton
was
abundantly
able
to
help
them
but
she
did
not
know
his
mother
and
it
would
savor
of
presumption
for
him
to
ask
so
great
a
favor
true
he
had
effected
a
most
profitable
sale
for
her
but
that
was
only
in
the
line
of
his
faithful
duty
and
gave
him
no
claim
upon
his
employer
i
thought
perhaps
the
gentlemen
you
were
traveling
with
the
one
who
has
gone
info
the
might
he
is
only
a
business
acquaintance
i
have
known
him
less
than
a
week
to
be
sure
that
alters
matters
he
is
not
your
employer
then
no
then
i
believe
i
shall
have
to
help
you
myself
ben
stared
at
his
companion
in
amazement
what
this
man
who
had
robbed
him
of
a
dollar
only
four
weeks
before
to
offer
assistance
in
so
important
a
matter
i
suppose
you
are
joking
said
he
after
a
pause
joking
far
from
it
i
mean
just
what
i
say
if
squire
davenport
undertakes
to
deprive
your
mother
of
her
home
i
will
interfere
and
you
will
see
with
effect
would
you
mind
explaining
to
me
how
you
would
help
us
asked
ben
yes
in
confidence
it
being
understood
that
i
follow
my
own
course
in
the
matter
that
is
fair
enough
suppose
i
tell
you
then
that
squire
davenport
i
believe
that
is
the
title
he
goes
by
in
your
village
owes
your
mother
more
than
the
amount
of
the
mortgage
is
this
true
said
ben
much
surprised
it
is
quite
true
but
how
can
it
be
your
father
at
his
death
held
a
note
of
davenport
for
a
thousand
dollars
money
which
he
had
placed
in
his
hands
a
note
bearing
six
per
cent
interest
ben
was
more
and
more
surprised
at
first
he
was
elated
then
depressed
it
will
do
me
no
good
he
said
nothing
was
found
at
death
and
the
note
is
no
doubt
destroyed
so
squire
davenport
thinks
said
his
companion
quietly
but
is
it
true
no
that
note
not
only
is
in
existence
but
i
knew
where
to
lay
my
hands
on
it
then
it
will
more
than
offset
the
mortgage
said
ben
joyfully
i
should
say
no
interest
has
been
paid
on
the
note
for
more
than
five
years
the
amount
due
must
be
quite
double
the
amount
of
the
mortgage
how
can
i
thank
you
for
this
information
said
ben
we
shall
not
be
forced
to
give
up
our
little
cottage
after
all
but
how
could
squire
davenport
so
wickedly
try
to
cheat
us
of
our
little
property
my
dear
boy
said
the
tramp
shrugging
his
shoulders
your
question
savors
of
verdancy
learn
that
there
is
no
meanness
too
great
to
be
inspired
by
the
love
of
money
but
squire
davenport
was
already
rich
and
for
that
reason
he
desired
to
become
richer
when
shall
we
go
to
see
the
squire
and
tell
him
about
the
note
i
prefer
that
you
should
wait
till
the
day
the
mortgage
comes
due
when
is
that
on
the
twentieth
of
december
then
on
the
nineteenth
of
december
we
will
both
go
to
pentonville
and
wait
till
the
squire
shows
his
hand
you
seem
to
be
excuse
me
in
better
circumstances
than
when
we
last
met
i
am
an
old
uncle
of
mine
died
last
month
and
considerately
left
me
ten
thousand
dollars
perhaps
if
he
had
known
more
about
my
way
of
life
he
would
have
found
another
heir
it
has
led
me
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
henceforth
i
am
respectable
as
befits
a
man
of
property
i
even
keep
a
card
case
he
drew
out
a
card
case
and
handed
a
card
to
ben
it
bore
the
name
of
harvey
dinsmore
dinsmore
said
our
young
hero
i
rejoice
at
your
good
fortune
thank
you
shall
we
be
friends
with
pleasure
then
i
have
more
good
news
for
you
your
father
owned
shares
in
a
western
railway
these
shares
are
selling
at
par
and
a
year
dividends
are
due
why
we
shall
be
rich
said
ben
fairly
dazzled
by
this
second
stroke
of
good
fortune
i
hope
so
though
this
is
only
a
beginning
how
can
we
prove
that
the
railway
shares
belong
to
us
leave
that
to
me
on
the
nineteenth
of
december
you
will
meet
me
in
pentonville
till
then
we
probably
shall
not
meet
at
this
moment
taylor
made
his
appearance
returning
from
the
and
harvey
dinsmore
left
them
well
ben
has
your
friend
entertained
you
asked
taylor
he
has
told
me
some
very
good
news
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
in
due
time
they
reached
new
york
and
ben
started
uptown
to
call
upon
hamilton
chapter
xxxiv
conrad
goes
into
wall
street
when
conrad
succeeded
ben
as
hamilton
private
secretary
he
was
elated
by
what
he
considered
his
promotion
his
first
disappointment
came
when
he
learned
that
his
salary
was
to
be
but
five
dollars
a
week
he
did
not
dare
to
remonstrate
with
his
employer
but
he
expressed
himself
freely
to
his
mother
cousin
hamilton
might
afford
to
pay
me
more
than
five
dollars
a
week
he
said
bitterly
it
is
small
said
his
mother
cautiously
but
we
must
look
to
the
future
if
you
mean
till
cousin
hamilton
dies
it
may
be
twenty
or
thirty
years
why
she
looks
healthier
than
you
mother
and
will
probably
live
longer
hill
looked
grave
she
did
not
fancy
this
speech
i
do
think
we
shall
have
to
wait
so
long
she
said
when
you
are
cousin
hamilton
will
probably
do
something
for
you
that
almost
five
years
grumbled
conrad
at
any
rate
we
have
got
ben
barclay
out
of
the
house
that
one
comfort
yes
i
am
glad
of
that
but
i
rather
be
in
my
old
place
than
this
if
i
am
to
get
only
five
dollars
a
week
young
people
are
so
impatient
sighed
hill
you
do
seem
to
consider
that
it
is
alone
taking
ben
place
but
you
have
got
rid
of
a
dangerous
rival
for
the
inheritance
that
true
said
conrad
and
i
hated
ben
i
rather
any
other
boy
would
cut
me
out
than
he
do
you
know
what
has
become
of
him
no
i
expect
that
he
has
gone
back
to
the
country
unless
blacking
boots
or
selling
papers
downtown
somewhere
by
jove
like
to
come
across
him
with
a
he
used
to
put
on
such
airs
i
would
like
to
have
heard
cousin
hamilton
give
him
the
grand
bounce
nothing
could
be
more
untrue
than
that
ben
putting
on
airs
but
conrad
saw
him
through
the
eyes
of
prejudice
and
persuaded
himself
that
such
was
the
fact
in
reality
ben
was
exceedingly
modest
and
unassuming
and
it
was
this
among
other
things
that
pleased
hamilton
conrad
continued
to
find
his
salary
insufficient
he
was
still
more
dissatisfied
after
an
interview
with
one
of
his
school
companions
a
boy
employed
in
a
wall
street
broker
office
he
was
just
returning
from
an
errand
on
which
hamilton
had
sent
him
when
he
overtook
fred
lathrop
on
his
way
uptown
the
attention
of
conrad
was
drawn
to
a
heavy
gold
ring
with
a
handsome
stone
on
fred
finger
where
did
you
get
that
ring
asked
conrad
who
had
himself
a
fancy
for
rings
bought
it
in
maiden
lane
how
do
you
like
it
it
is
splendid
do
you
mind
telling
me
how
much
you
paid
i
paid
dollars
it
worth
more
dollars
ejaculated
conrad
why
you
must
be
a
millionaire
where
did
you
get
so
much
money
i
did
find
it
in
the
street
answered
fred
jocularly
ca
you
tell
a
feller
you
did
save
it
out
of
your
wages
did
you
my
wages
i
should
say
not
why
i
only
get
six
dollars
a
week
and
have
to
pay
car
fare
and
lunches
out
of
that
then
it
is
equal
to
my
five
dollars
for
that
is
all
clear
but
all
the
same
i
ca
save
anything
nor
i
then
how
can
you
afford
to
buy
dollar
rings
i
do
mind
telling
you
said
fred
i
made
the
money
by
speculating
speculating
repeated
conrad
still
in
the
dark
yes
i
tell
you
all
about
it
do
there
a
good
fellow
you
see
i
bought
fifty
erie
shares
on
a
margin
how
that
why
i
got
a
broker
to
buy
me
fifty
shares
on
a
margin
of
one
per
cent
he
did
it
to
oblige
me
i
had
any
money
to
put
up
but
i
had
done
him
one
or
two
favors
and
he
did
it
out
of
good
nature
as
the
stock
was
on
the
rise
he
did
run
much
of
a
risk
well
i
bought
at
and
sold
at
so
i
made
fifty
dollars
over
and
above
the
commission
i
tell
you
i
felt
good
when
the
broker
paid
me
over
five
bills
i
should
think
you
would
i
was
afraid
i
spend
the
money
foolishly
so
i
went
right
off
and
bought
this
ring
i
can
sell
it
for
what
i
gave
any
time
conrad
cupidity
was
greatly
excited
by
this
remarkable
luck
of
fred
that
seems
an
easy
way
of
making
money
he
said
do
you
think
i
could
try
it
anybody
can
do
it
if
he
got
the
money
to
plank
down
for
a
margin
i
do
think
i
quite
understand
then
i
tell
you
you
buy
fifty
shares
of
stock
costing
say
fifty
dollars
a
share
that
would
be
hundred
dollars
yes
if
you
bought
it
right
out
but
you
do
you
give
the
broker
whatever
per
cent
he
requires
say
a
dollar
a
share
most
of
them
do
do
it
so
cheap
and
he
buys
the
stock
on
your
account
if
it
goes
up
one
or
two
points
say
to
or
he
sells
out
and
the
profit
goes
to
you
deducting
cents
a
share
which
he
charges
for
buying
and
selling
besides
that
he
pays
you
back
your
margin
that
splendid
but
does
it
ever
go
down
i
should
say
so
if
it
goes
down
a
dollar
a
share
then
of
course
you
lose
fifty
dollars
conrad
looked
serious
this
was
not
quite
so
satisfactory
it
is
rather
risky
then
he
said
of
course
there
some
risk
but
you
know
the
old
proverb
venture
nothing
have
you
must
choose
the
right
stock
one
that
is
going
up
i
do
know
anything
about
stock
said
conrad
i
do
said
fred
if
i
had
money
i
know
what
i
buy
what
asked
conrad
eagerly
pacific
mail
do
you
think
that
going
up
i
feel
sure
of
it
i
overheard
my
boss
and
another
broker
talking
about
it
yesterday
and
they
both
predicted
a
bull
movement
in
it
does
that
mean
it
going
up
to
be
sure
i
should
like
to
buy
some
have
you
got
money
to
plank
down
as
a
margin
conrad
had
in
his
pocketbook
fifty
dollars
which
he
had
collected
for
hamilton
being
a
month
rent
on
a
small
store
on
third
avenue
it
flashed
upon
him
that
with
this
money
he
could
make
fifty
dollars
for
himself
and
be
able
to
pay
back
the
original
sum
to
hamilton
as
soon
as
the
operation
was
concluded
could
you
manage
it
for
me
fred
he
asked
yes
i
would
mind
then
i
give
you
fifty
dollars
and
you
do
the
best
you
can
for
me
if
i
succeed
i
make
you
a
present
all
right
i
hope
you
win
i
am
sure
illegible
not
giving
himself
time
to
think
of
the
serious
breach
of
trust
he
was
committing
conrad
took
the
money
from
his
pocket
and
transferred
it
to
his
companion
it
wo
take
long
will
it
he
asked
anxiously
very
likely
the
stock
will
be
bought
and
sold
that
will
be
splendid
you
let
me
know
right
off
yes
i
attend
to
that
conrad
went
home
and
reported
to
hamilton
that
the
tenant
had
not
paid
but
would
do
so
on
saturday
hamilton
was
a
little
surprised
for
the
third
avenue
tenant
had
never
before
put
her
off
something
in
conrad
manner
excited
her
suspicion
and
she
resolved
the
next
day
to
call
herself
on
clark
the
tenant
he
would
be
likely
to
speak
of
the
postponement
and
give
reasons
for
it
chapter
xxxv
turning
the
tables
now
conrad
said
hamilton
will
you
tell
me
by
what
authority
you
send
away
my
visitors
i
did
suppose
you
would
want
to
see
ben
stammered
conrad
why
not
after
what
he
has
done
what
has
he
done
he
stole
your
opera
glass
and
pawned
it
you
are
mistaken
it
was
stolen
by
a
different
person
conrad
started
uneasily
and
his
mother
who
was
not
in
the
secret
looked
surprised
i
know
who
took
the
opera
glass
continued
hamilton
who
was
it
asked
the
housekeeper
your
son
i
regret
to
say
this
is
a
slander
exclaimed
hill
angrily
cousin
hamilton
that
boy
has
deceived
you
my
information
did
not
come
from
ben
if
that
is
what
you
mean
my
son
would
be
incapable
of
stealing
continued
hill
i
should
be
glad
to
think
so
it
can
easily
be
settled
let
conrad
go
with
me
tomorrow
to
the
pawnbroker
from
whom
i
recovered
the
glass
and
see
if
he
recognizes
him
he
would
be
sure
to
say
it
was
me
stammered
conrad
at
any
rate
he
told
me
it
was
not
ben
who
made
no
opposition
to
accompanying
me
i
see
there
is
a
plot
against
my
poor
boy
said
hill
bitterly
on
the
contrary
i
shall
be
glad
to
believe
him
innocent
but
there
is
another
matter
that
requires
investigation
conrad
here
is
a
letter
which
has
come
for
you
are
you
willing
i
should
open
and
read
it
i
do
like
to
show
my
letters
said
conrad
sullenly
the
boy
is
right
said
his
mother
always
ready
to
back
up
her
son
i
have
good
reason
for
wishing
to
know
the
contents
of
the
letter
said
hamilton
sternly
i
will
not
open
it
unless
conrad
consents
but
i
will
call
on
the
brokers
and
question
them
as
to
their
motive
in
addressing
it
to
a
boy
conrad
was
silent
he
saw
that
there
was
no
escape
for
him
shall
i
read
it
asked
hamilton
yes
answered
conrad
feebly
the
letter
was
opened
it
ran
thus
conrad
hill
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
call
at
our
office
at
once
and
pay
commission
due
us
for
buying
add
selling
fifty
shares
pacific
mail
the
fall
in
the
price
of
the
stock
as
we
have
already
notified
you
exhausted
the
money
you
placed
in
our
hands
as
margin
yours
respectfully
bird
brant
i
hope
cousin
hamilton
you
wo
be
too
hard
on
the
poor
boy
said
the
housekeeper
he
thought
he
would
be
able
to
replace
the
money
you
and
conrad
have
done
your
best
to
prejudice
me
against
ben
you
are
mistaken
said
the
housekeeper
quickly
showing
some
evidence
of
agitation
i
have
learned
that
the
letter
which
lured
ben
to
a
gambling
house
was
concocted
between
you
the
letter
i
have
in
my
possession
who
told
you
such
a
falsehood
if
it
is
ben
it
is
not
ben
hill
he
is
as
much
surprised
as
you
are
to
learn
it
now
the
letter
i
submitted
to
an
expert
who
has
positively
identified
the
handwriting
as
yours
hill
you
were
very
persistent
in
your
attempts
to
make
me
believe
than
ben
was
addicted
to
frequenting
gambling
houses
i
see
you
are
determined
to
believe
me
guilty
said
hill
perhaps
you
think
i
know
about
the
opera
glass
and
this
stock
gambling
i
have
no
evidence
of
it
but
i
know
enough
to
justify
me
in
taking
a
decisive
step
hill
listened
apprehensively
it
is
this
you
and
conrad
must
leave
my
house
i
can
no
longer
tolerate
your
presence
here
you
send
us
out
to
starve
said
the
housekeeper
bitterly
no
i
will
provide
for
you
i
will
allow
you
fifty
dollars
a
month
and
conrad
half
as
much
and
you
can
board
where
you
please
while
that
boy
usurps
our
place
said
hill
bitterly
that
is
a
matter
to
be
decided
between
ben
and
myself
we
will
go
at
once
said
the
housekeeper
i
do
require
it
you
can
stay
here
until
you
have
secured
a
satisfactory
boarding
place
but
conrad
and
his
mother
left
the
house
the
next
morning
they
saw
that
hamilton
was
no
longer
to
be
deceived
and
they
could
gain
nothing
by
staying
there
was
an
angry
scene
between
the
mother
and
son
were
you
mad
conrad
said
his
mother
to
steal
where
you
were
sure
to
be
found
out
it
is
your
folly
that
has
turned
cousin
hamilton
against
us
no
it
is
that
boy
i
like
to
wring
his
neck
i
hope
he
will
come
to
some
bad
end
said
hill
malignantly
if
he
had
not
come
to
the
house
none
of
this
would
have
happened
meanwhile
ben
and
his
patroness
had
a
satisfactory
conversation
i
hope
you
are
satisfied
with
my
management
mrs
hamilton
said
our
hero
you
have
done
wonderfully
ben
through
you
i
am
the
richer
by
thousand
dollars
at
the
very
least
for
the
farm
would
have
been
dear
at
five
thousand
whereas
it
was
sold
for
forty
thousand
i
am
very
glad
you
are
satisfied
you
shall
have
reason
to
be
glad
i
intend
to
pay
you
a
commission
for
selling
the
place
thank
you
said
ben
joyfully
he
thought
it
possible
hamilton
might
give
him
fifty
dollars
and
this
would
have
been
very
welcome
under
the
circumstances
i
shall
allow
you
an
extra
commission
say
per
cent
how
much
will
per
cent
amount
to
on
forty
thousand
dollars
four
thousand
answered
ben
mechanically
consider
yourself
worth
fourth
thousand
dollars
then
but
this
is
too
much
hamilton
said
ben
scarcely
crediting
his
good
fortune
then
give
half
of
it
to
your
mother
said
hamilton
smiling
now
we
can
pay
off
the
mortgage
exclaimed
ben
joyfully
what
mortgage
ben
told
the
story
and
it
aroused
the
lively
sympathy
of
his
patroness
as
soon
as
the
purchase
money
is
paid
she
said
you
shall
have
you
commission
and
sooner
if
it
is
needed
chapter
xxxvi
a
letter
from
rose
gardiner
ben
resumed
his
place
as
the
secretary
and
confidential
clerk
of
hamilton
he
found
his
position
more
agreeable
when
hill
and
conrad
were
fairly
out
of
the
house
in
place
of
the
first
a
german
woman
was
engaged
and
there
were
no
more
sour
looks
and
sneering
words
of
course
ben
kept
up
a
weekly
correspondence
with
his
mother
he
did
not
tell
her
the
extent
of
his
good
fortune
he
wished
that
to
be
a
surprise
when
the
time
came
from
his
mother
too
he
received
weekly
letters
telling
him
not
unfrequently
how
she
missed
him
though
she
was
glad
he
was
doing
so
well
one
day
beside
his
mother
letter
was
another
he
did
not
know
the
handwriting
but
looking
eagerly
to
the
end
he
saw
the
name
of
rose
gardiner
what
would
rose
say
ben
asked
himself
if
she
knew
that
i
am
worth
four
thousand
dollars
the
money
had
been
paid
to
ben
and
was
deposited
in
four
different
savings
banks
till
he
could
decide
on
a
better
investment
so
he
was
quite
sure
of
having
more
than
enough
to
pay
off
the
mortgage
and
redeem
the
cottage
since
mother
is
worrying
i
must
write
and
set
her
mind
at
rest
he
decided
he
wrote
accordingly
telling
his
mother
not
to
feel
anxious
for
he
had
wealthy
friends
and
he
felt
sure
with
their
help
of
paying
off
the
mortgage
but
do
tell
anybody
this
he
continued
for
i
want
to
give
the
squire
and
kirk
a
disagreeable
surprise
i
shall
come
to
pentonville
two
days
before
and
may
stay
a
week
he
had
already
spoken
to
hamilton
about
having
this
week
as
a
vacation
chapter

ben
visit
to
pentonville
on
the
eighteenth
of
december
ben
arrived
in
pentonville
it
was
his
first
visit
since
he
went
up
to
new
york
for
good
he
reached
home
without
observation
and
found
his
mother
overjoyed
to
see
him
it
has
seemed
a
long
long
time
that
you
have
been
away
ben
she
said
yes
mother
but
i
did
a
good
thing
in
going
to
new
york
you
are
looking
well
ben
and
you
have
grown
yes
mother
and
best
of
all
i
have
prospered
squire
davenport
ca
have
the
house
you
do
mean
to
say
ben
that
you
have
the
money
to
pay
it
off
asked
his
mother
with
eager
hope
yes
mother
and
better
still
the
money
is
my
own
this
ca
be
true
ben
she
said
incredulously
yes
but
it
is
though
you
are
to
ask
me
no
questions
until
after
the
twentieth
then
i
will
tell
you
all
i
am
afraid
i
shall
have
to
send
you
to
the
store
for
i
am
out
of
groceries
a
list
was
given
and
ben
started
for
the
store
kirk
looked
up
in
surprise
as
he
entered
you
the
barclay
boy
ai
you
yes
sir
i
thought
you
were
in
new
york

it
go
hey
ben
smiled
but
did
not
answer
i
may
give
you
something
to
do

kirk
in
a
patronizing
tone

employed
in

store

i
was
here
some
months
i
give
you
two
dollars
a
week

you
said
ben
meekly
but
i
shall
have
to
take
a
little
time
to
decide

the
rest
of
the
week
i
suppose
you
want
to
help
your
mother
move
she
could
move
alone
very
well
you
can
begin
next
monday
when
ben
was
going
home
he
met
his
old
enemy
tom
davenport
eyes
lighted
up
when
he
saw
ben
and
he
crossed
the
street
to
speak
to
him
it
may
be
mentioned
that
though
ben
had
a
new
and
stylish
suit
of
clothes
he
came
home
in
the
old
suit
he
had
worn
away
and
his
appearance
therefore
by
no
means
betokened
prosperity
so
you
back
again
said
tom
abruptly
yes
i
always
said
you
come
back
are
you
going
to
look
for
something
to
do
tom
asked
kirk
has
offered
me
a
place
in
the
store
how
much
pay
two
dollars
a
week
you
better
take
it
i
hardly
think
i
can
work
at
that
figure
said
ben
mildly
kirk
wo
pay
you
any
more
i
think
of
it
by
the
way
tom
call
around
and
see
me
some
time
i
hardly
think
i
shall
have
time
said
tom
haughtily
he
talks
as
if
i
were
his
equal
he
said
to
himself
well
good
afternoon
remember
me
to
your
father
tom
stared
at
ben
in
surprise
really
the
store
boy
was
getting
very
presumptuous
he
thought
chapter
xxxviii
conclusion
on
the
evening
of
the
nineteenth
of
december
ben
stood
on
the
piazza
of
the
village
hotel
when
the
stage
returned
from
the
depot
he
examined
anxiously
the
passengers
who
got
out
his
eyes
lighted
up
joyfully
as
he
recognized
in
one
the
man
he
was
looking
for
dinsmore
he
said
coming
forward
hastily
you
see
i
have
kept
my
word
said
harvey
dinsmore
with
a
smile
i
feared
you
would
not
come
i
wished
to
see
the
discomfiture
of
our
friend
squire
davenport
so
is
the
day
yes
i
should
like
to

whew
then
you

indeed
been
fortunate
for
a
boy
i

to
succeed

forenoon
the
stranger

at

of
barclay
he
was
admitted
by
ben
mother
said
ben
this
is
harvey
dinsmore
i
believe
we
have
met
before
said
dinsmore
smiling
i
fear
my
first
visit
was
not
welcome
i
come
in
more
respectable
guise
and
as
a
friend
you
are
welcome
sir
said
the
widow
courteously
i
am
glad
to
see
you
i
should
hardly
have
known
you
i
take
that
as
a
compliment
i
am
a
tramp
no
longer
but
a
respectable
and
i
may
add
citizen
now
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
name
it
sir
place
me
if
convenient
where
i
can
hear
the
interview
between
davenport
and
yourself
without
myself
being
seen
ben
conducted
dinsmore
into
the
kitchen
opening
out
of
the
sitting
room
and
gave
him
a
chair
at
five
minute
to
twelve
there
was
a
knock
at
the
outer
door
and
ben
admitted
squire
davenport
so
you
are
home
again
benjamin
said
the
squire
had
enough
of
the
city
i
am
taking
a
vacation
i
thought
mother
would
need
me
she
will
to
help
her
move
step
in
sir
squire
davenport
with
the
air
of
a
master
followed
ben
into
the
sitting
room
barclay
sat
quietly
at
the
table
with
her
sewing
in
hand
widow
said
the
squire
patronizingly
he
was
rather
surprised
at
her
quiet
unruffled
demeanor
he
expected
to
find
her
tearful
and
sad
squire
davenport
she
said
quietly
is
your
family
well
zounds
she
takes
it
coolly
thought
the
squire
very
well
he
said
dryly
i
suppose
you
know
my
business
you
come
about
the
mortgage
yes
have
you
decided
where
to
move
my
mother
does
not
propose
to
move
said
ben
calmly
oho
that
your
opinion
is
it
i
apprehend
it
is
not
for
you
to
say
that
where
we
differ
we
intend
to
stay
without
consulting
me
eh
yes
sir
you
are
impudent
boy
said
the
squire
waxing
wrathful
i
shall
give
you
just
three
days
to
find
another
home
though
i
could
force
you
to
leave
at
once
this
house
belongs
to
my
mother
you
are
mistaken
it
belongs
to
me
when
did
you
buy
it
you
are
talking
foolishly
i
hold
a
mortgage
for
seven
hundred
dollars
on
the
property
and
you
ca
pay
it
i
am
willing
to
cancel
the
mortgage
and
pay
your
mother
three
hundred
dollars
cash
for
the
place
it
is
worth
a
good
deal
more
who
will
pay
more
demanded
the
quire
throwing
himself
back
in
his
chair
i
will
answered
ben
ho
ho
that
a
good
joke
said
the
squire
why
you
are
not
worth
five
dollars
in
the
world
it
does
matter
whether
i
am
or
not
my
mother
wo
sell
then
pay
the
mortgage
said
the
squire
angrily
i
am
prepared
to
do
so
have
you
a
release
with
you
squire
davenport
stared
at
ben
in
amazement
enough
of
this
folly
he
said
sternly
i
am
not
in
the
humor
for
jokes
squire
davenport
i
am
not
joking
i
have
here
money
enough
to
pay
the
mortgage
and
ben
drew
from
his
pocket
a
thick
roll
of
bills
where
did
you
get
that
money
asked
squire
davenport
in
evident
discomfiture
i
do
think
it
necessary
to
answer
that
question
but
there
is
another
matter
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
about
when
will
you
be
ready
to
pay
the
sum
you
owe
my
father
estate
squire
davenport
started
violently
what
do
you
mean
he
demanded
hoarsely
harvey
dinsmore
entered
the
room
from
the
kitchen
at
that
point
i
will
answer
that
question
he
said
ben
refers
to
a
note
for
a
thousand
dollars
signed
by
you
which
was
found
on
his
father
person
at
the
time
of
his
death
no
such
note
is
in
existence
said
the
squire
triumphantly
he
remembered
that
he
had
burned
it
you
are
mistaken
that
note
you
burned
was
only
a
copy
i
have
the
original
with
me
you
treacherous
rascal
exclaimed
the
squire
in
great
excitement
when
i
have
dealings
with
a
knave
i
am
not
very
scrupulous
said
dinsmore
coolly
i
wo
pay
the
note
you
have
trumped
up
this
is
a
conspiracy
then
said
ben
the
note
will
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
a
lawyer
this
is
a
conspiracy
to
prevent
my
foreclosing
the
mortgage
but
it
wo
work
said
the
squire
angrily
there
you
are
mistaken
i
will
pay
the
mortgage
now
in
the
presence
of
dinsmore
and
let
the
other
matter
be
settled
hereafter
please
prepare
the
necessary
papers
suddenly
the
squire
did
as
requested
the
money
was
paid
over
and
ben
turning
to
his
mother
said
mother
the
house
is
ours
once
more
without
incumbrance
thank
god
ejaculated
the
widow
dinsmore
said
squire
davenport
when
the
business
was
concluded
may
i
have
a
private
word
with
you
please
accompany
me
to
my
house
as
you
please
sir
when
they
emerged
into
the
street
squire
davenport
said
of
course
this
is
all
a
humbug
you
ca
have
the
original
with
you
but
i
have
sir
you
should
have
looked
more
closely
at
the
one
you
burned
ca
we
compromise
this
matter
asked
the
squire
in
an
insinuating
tone
no
sir
said
dinsmore
with
emphasis
i
have
got
through
with
rascality
you
ca
tempt
me
if
i
were
as
hard
up
as
when
i
called
upon
you
before
i
might
not
be
able
to
resist
you
but
i
am
worth
over
ten
thousand
dollars
and
have
you
broken
into
a
bank
asked
squire
davenport
with
a
sneer
i
have
come
into
a
legacy
to
cut
matters
short
it
will
be
for
your
interest
to
pay
this
claim
and
not
allow
the
story
to
be
made
known
it
would
damage
your
reputation
in
the
end
this
was
what
the
squire
was
forced
very
unwillingly
to
do
the
amount
he
had
to
pay
to
the
estate
of
the
man
whose
family
he
had
sought
to
defraud
was
nearly
fifteen
hundred
dollars
this
added
to
ben
four
thousand
made
the
family
very
comfortable
kirk
was
compelled
to
look
elsewhere
for
a
house
no
one
was
more
chagrined
at
the
unexpected
issue
of
the
affair
than
tom
davenport
whose
mean
and
jealous
disposition
made
more
intense
his
hatred
of
ben
several
years
have
elapsed
ben
is
in
the
office
of
a
real
estate
lawyer
in
new
york
as
junior
partner
all
hamilton
business
is
in
his
hands
and
it
is
generally
thought
that
he
will
receive
a
handsome
legacy
from
her
eventually
barclay
prefers
to
live
in
pentonville
but
ben
often
visits
her
whenever
he
goes
to
pentonville
he
never
fails
to
call
on
rose
gardiner
now
a
beautiful
young
lady
of
marriageable
age
she
has
lost
none
of
her
partiality
for
ben
and
it
is
generally
understood
that
they
are
engaged
i
have
reason
to
think
that
the
rumor
is
correct
and
that
rose
will
change
her
name
to
barclay
within
a
year
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
to
barclay
who
has
long
looked
upon
rose
as
a
daughter
tom
davenport
is
now
in
the
city
but
his
course
is
far
from
creditable
his
father
has
more
than
once
been
compelled
to
pay
his
debts
and
has
angrily
refused
to
do
so
again
in
fact
he
has
lost
a
large
part
of
his
once
handsome
fortune
and
bids
fair
to
close
his
life
in
penury
success
has
come
to
ben
because
he
deserved
it
and
retribution
to
tom
davenport
harvey
dinsmore
once
given
over
to
evil
courses
has
redeemed
himself
and
is
a
reputable
business
man
in
new
york
hamilton
still
lives
happy
in
the
success
of
her
protege
conrad
and
his
mother
have
tried
more
than
once
to
regain
their
positions
in
her
household
but
in
vain
none
of
my
young
readers
will
pity
them
they
are
fully
rewarded

their
treachery
