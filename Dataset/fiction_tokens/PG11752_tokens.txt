introduction
few
of
the
more
astute
critics
who
have
appraised
the
work
of
james
branch
cabell
have
failed
to
call
attention
to
that
extraordinary
cohesion
which
makes
his
very
latest
novel
a
further
flowering
of
the
seed
of
his
very
earliest
literary
work
especially
among
his
later
books
does
the
scheme
of
each
seem
to
dovetail
into
the
scheme
of
the
other
and
the
whole
of
his
writing
take
on
the
character
of
an
uninterrupted
discourse
to
this
phenomenon
which
is
at
once
a
fact
and
an
illusion
of
continuity
cabell
himself
has
consciously
contributed
not
only
by
a
subtly
elaborate
use
of
conjunctions
by
repetition
and
by
reintroducing
characters
from
his
other
books
but
by
actually
setting
his
expertness
in
genealogy
to
the
genial
task
of
devising
a
family
tree
for
his
figures
of
fiction
if
this
were
an
actual
continuity
more
tangible
than
that
fluid
abstraction
we
call
the
life
force
if
it
were
merely
a
tireless
reiteration
and
recasting
of
characters
cabell
work
would
have
an
unbearable
monotony
but
at
bottom
this
apparent
continuity
has
no
more
material
existence
than
has
the
thread
of
lineal
descent
to
insist
upon
its
importance
is
to
obscure
as
has
been
obscured
the
epic
range
of
cabell
creative
genius
it
is
to
fail
to
observe
that
he
has
treated
in
his
many
books
every
mainspring
of
human
action
and
that
his
themes
have
been
the
cardinal
dreams
and
impulses
which
have
in
them
heroic
qualities
each
separate
volume
has
a
unity
and
harmony
of
a
complete
and
separate
life
for
the
excellent
reason
that
with
the
consummate
skill
of
an
artist
he
is
concerned
exclusively
in
each
book
with
one
definite
heroic
impulse
and
its
frustrations
it
is
true
of
course
that
like
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
life
cabell
artistic
progeny
sprang
from
a
first
conceptual
germ
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
that
animating
idea
is
the
assumption
that
if
life
may
be
said
to
have
an
aim
it
must
be
an
aim
to
terminate
in
success
and
splendor
it
postulates
the
high
fine
importance
of
excess
the
choice
or
discovery
of
an
overwhelming
impulse
in
life
and
a
conscientious
dedication
to
its
fullest
realization
it
is
the
quality
and
intensity
of
the
dream
only
which
raises
men
above
the
biological
norm
and
it
is
fidelity
to
the
dream
which
differentiates
the
exceptional
figure
the
man
of
heroic
stature
from
the
muddling
aimless
mediocrities
about
him
what
the
dream
is
matters
not
at
all
it
may
be
a
dream
of
sainthood
kingship
love
art
asceticism
or
sensual
pleasure
so
long
as
it
is
fully
expressed
with
all
the
resources
of
self
it
is
this
sort
of
completion
which
cabell
has
elected
to
depict
in
all
his
work
the
complete
sensualist
in
demetrios
the
complete
in
felix
kennaston
the
complete
poet
in
marlowe
the
complete
lover
in
perion
in
each
he
has
shown
that
this
complete
is
achieved
at
the
expense
of
all
other
possible
selves
and
that
herein
lies
the
tragedy
of
the
ideal
perfection
is
a
costly
flower
and
is
cultured
only
by
an
uncompromising
strict
husbandry
all
this
is
we
see
the
ideational
gonfalon
under
which
surge
the
romanticists
but
from
the
evidence
at
hand
it
is
the
banner
to
which
life
also
bears
allegiance
it
is
in
humanity
records
that
it
has
reserved
its
honors
for
its
romantic
figures
it
remembers
its
caesars
its
saints
its
sinners
it
applauds
with
a
complete
suspension
of
moral
judgment
its
heroines
and
its
heroes
who
achieve
the
greatest
and
from
the
splendid
triumphs
and
tragic
defeats
of
humanity
individual
strivings
have
come
our
heritage
of
wisdom
and
of
poetry
once
we
understand
the
fundamentals
of
cabell
artistic
aims
it
is
not
easy
to
escape
the
fact
that
in
of
he
undertook
the
staggering
and
almost
unsuspected
task
of
rewriting
humanity
sacred
books
just
as
in
he
gave
us
a
stupendous
analogue
of
the
ceaseless
quest
for
beauty
for
we
must
accept
the
truth
that
cabell
is
not
a
novelist
at
all
in
the
common
acceptance
of
the
term
but
a
historian
of
the
human
soul
his
books
are
neither
documentary
nor
representational
his
characters
are
symbols
of
human
desires
and
motives
by
the
not
at
all
simple
process
of
recording
faithfully
the
projections
of
his
rich
and
varied
imagination
he
has
written
thirteen
books
which
he
accurately
terms
biography
wherein
is
the
truth
about
human
life
ii
among
the
scant
certainties
vouchsafed
us
is
that
every
age
lives
by
its
special
catchwords
whether
from
rebellion
against
the
irking
monotony
of
its
inherited
creeds
or
from
compulsions
generated
by
its
own
complexities
each
age
develops
its
code
of
convenient
illusions
which
minimize
cerebration
in
dilemmas
of
conduct
by
postulating
an
unequivocal
cleavage
between
the
current
right
and
the
current
wrong
it
works
until
men
tire
of
it
or
challenge
the
cleavage
or
until
conditions
render
the
code
obsolete
it
has
in
it
happily
a
certain
poetic
merit
always
it
presents
an
ideal
to
be
lived
up
to
it
gives
direction
to
the
uncertain
stray
impulses
of
life
the
chivalric
code
is
no
worse
than
most
and
certainly
it
is
prettier
than
some
it
is
a
code
peculiar
to
an
age
or
at
least
it
flourishes
best
in
an
age
wherein
sentiment
and
the
stuff
of
dreams
are
easily
translatable
into
action
its
requirements
are
less
of
the
intellect
than
of
the
heart
it
puts
god
honor
and
mistress
above
all
else
and
stipulates
that
a
knight
shall
serve
these
three
without
any
reservation
it
requires
of
its
secular
practitioners
the
holy
virtues
of
an
active
piety
a
modified
chastity
and
an
unqualified
obedience
at
all
events
to
the
categorical
imperative
the
obligation
of
poverty
it
omits
for
the
code
arose
at
a
time
when
the
spiritual
snobbery
of
the
meek
and
lowly
was
not
pressing
the
simile
about
the
camel
and
the
eye
of
the
needle
it
leads
to
charming
manners
and
to
delicate
amenities
it
is
the
opposite
of
the
code
of
gallantry
for
while
the
code
of
chivalry
takes
everything
with
a
becoming
seriousness
the
code
of
gallantry
takes
everything
with
a
wink
if
one
should
stoop
to
pick
flaws
with
the
chivalric
ideal
it
would
be
to
point
out
a
certain
priggishness
and
intolerance
for
while
it
is
all
very
well
for
one
to
cherish
the
delusion
that
he
is
god
vicar
on
earth
and
to
go
about
his
father
business
armed
with
a
shining
rectitude
yet
the
unhallowed
may
be
moved
to
deprecate
the
enterprise
when
they
recall
with
discomfort
the
zealous
vicarship
of
say
the
late
anthony
comstock
but
here
i
blunder
into
cabell
province
for
he
has
joined
many
graceful
words
in
delectable
and
poignant
proof
of
just
that
lamentable
tendency
of
man
to
make
a
mess
of
even
his
most
immaculate
conceivings
when
he
wrote
cabell
was
yet
young
enough
to
view
the
code
less
with
the
appraising
eye
of
a
pawnbroker
than
with
the
ardent
eye
of
an
amateur
he
knew
its
value
but
he
did
not
know
its
price
so
he
made
of
it
the
thesis
for
a
dizain
of
beautiful
happenings
that
are
almost
flawless
in
their
verbal
beauty
iii
it
is
perhaps
of
historical
interest
here
to
record
the
esteem
in
which
mark
twain
held
the
genius
of
cabell
as
it
was
manifested
as
early
as
a
dozen
years
ago
cabell
wrote
soul
of
or
as
it
was
rechristened
on
revision
at
the
great
humorist
request
and
during
the
long
days
and
nights
of
his
last
illness
it
was
cabell
books
which
gave
mark
twain
his
greatest
joy
this
knowledge
mitigates
the
pleasure
no
doubt
of
those
who
still
after
his
fifteen
years
of
writing
encounter
him
intermittently
with
a
feeling
of
having
made
a
great
literary
discovery
the
truth
is
that
cabell
has
been
discovered
over
and
over
with
each
succeeding
book
from
that
first
fine
enthusiasm
with
which
percival
pollard
reviewed
eagle
to
that
generous
acknowledgment
by
hugh
walpole
that
no
one
in
england
save
perhaps
conrad
and
hardy
was
so
sure
of
literary
permanence
as
james
branch
cabell
with
cream
of
the
jest
beyond
and
of
before
him
it
is
not
easy
for
the
perceptive
critic
to
doubt
this
permanence
one
might
as
sensibly
deny
a
future
to
ecclesiastes
golden
ass
gulliver
and
the
works
of
rabelais
as
to
predict
oblivion
for
such
a
thesaurus
of
ironic
wit
and
fine
fantasy
mellow
wisdom
and
strange
beauty
as
but
to
appreciate
the
tales
of
is
it
seems
a
gift
more
frequently
reserved
for
the
general
reader
than
for
the
professional
literary
evaluator
certainly
years
before
discussion
of
cabell
was
artificially
augmented
by
the
suppression
of
there
were
many
genuine
lovers
of
romance
who
had
read
these
tales
with
pure
enjoyment
that
they
did
not
analyse
and
articulate
their
enjoyment
for
the
edification
of
others
does
not
lessen
the
quality
of
their
appreciation
even
in
those
years
they
found
in
cabell
early
tales
what
we
find
who
have
since
been
directed
to
them
by
the
curiosity
engendered
by
his
later
work
namely
a
superb
craftsmanship
in
recreating
a
vanished
age
an
atmosphere
in
keeping
with
the
themes
a
fluid
graceful
personal
style
a
poetic
ecstasy
a
fine
sense
of
drama
and
a
unity
and
symmetry
which
are
the
of
literary
genius

was

to
how
freely
in

nicolas

plagiarized
from
raimbaut
de
vaqueiras
and
other
elder
poets
and
sixth
and
lastly
should
confession
be
made
that
in
the
present
rendering
a
purely
arbitrary
title
has
been
assigned
this
little
book
chiefly
for
commercial
reasons
since
the
word
dizain
has
been
adjudged
both
untranslatable
and
in
its
pristine
form
repellantly
you
are
to
give
my
titular
makeshift
then
a
wide
interpretation
and
are
always
to
remember
that
in
the
bleak
florid
age
these
tales
commemorate
this
chivalry
was
much
the
rarelier
significant
of
any
personal
trait
than
of
a
code
in
consonance
with
which
all
estimable
people
lived
and
died
its
root
was
the
assumption
uncontested
then
that
a
gentleman
will
always
serve
his
god
his
honor
and
his
lady
without
any
reservation
nor
did
the
many
emanating
ever
deal
with
special
cases
as
concerns
this
triple
fixed
and
fundamental
homage
such
is
the
trinity
served
hereinafter
now
about
or
i
have
written
elsewhere
elsewhere
also
i
find
it
recorded
that
the
cornerstone
of
chivalry
is
the
idea
of
vicarship
for
the
chivalrous
person
is
in
his
own
eyes
at
least
the
child
of
god
and
goes
about
this
world
as
his
father
representative
in
an
alien
country
i
believe
the
definition
holds
it
certainly
tends
to
explain
the
otherwise
puzzling
pertinacity
with
which
the
characters
in
these
tales
talk
about
god
and
act
upon
an
assured
knowledge
as
to
heaven
private
intentions
and
preferences
these
people
are
the
members
of
one
family
engrossed
as
all
of
us
are
apt
to
be
when
in
the
society
of
our
kin
by
family
matters
and
traditions
and
it
is
not
merely
that
they
are
all
large
children
consciously
dependent
in
all
things
upon
a
not
foolishly
indulgent
father
who
keeps
an
interested
eye
upon
the
least
of
their
doings
and
punishes
at
need
not
merely
that
they
know
themselves
to
act
under
surveillance
and
to
speak
within
of
a
divine
eavesdropper
the
point
is
rather
that
they
know
this
observation
to
be
as
tender
the
punishment
to
be
as
unwilling
as
that
which
they
themselves
extend
to
their
own
children
pranks
and
misdemeanors
the
point
is
that
to
them
heaven
is
a
place
as
actual
and
tangible
as
we
consider
alaska
or
algiers
to
be
and
that
their
living
is
a
conscious
journeying
toward
this
actual
place
the
point
is
that
the
father
is
a
real
father
and
not
a
word
spelt
with
capital
letters
in
the
church
service
not
an
abstraction
not
a
sort
of
a
something
vaguely
describable
as
the
life
force
but
a
very
famous
kinsman
of
whom
one
is
naïvely
proud
and
whom
one
is
on
the
way
to
visit
the
point
in
brief
is
that
his
honor
and
yours
are
inextricably
blended
and
are
both
implicated
in
your
behavior
on
the
journey
we
nowadays
can
just
cloudily
imagine
this
viewing
of
life
as
a
sort
of
from
which
one
eventually
goes
home
with
an
official
report
as
to
progress
and
deportment
and
in
retaliation
for
being
debarred
from
the
comforts
of
this
view
the
psychoanalysts
have
no
doubt
invented
for
it
some
opprobrious
explanation
at
all
events
this
chivalry
was
a
pragmatic
hypothesis
it
worked
and
served
society
for
a
long
while
not
faultlessly
of
course
but
by
creating
like
all
the
other
codes
of
human
conduct
which
men
have
yet
tried
a
mêlée
wherein
contended
courtesy
and
humanity
friendliness
hardihood
love
and
friendship
and
murder
hate
and
virtue
and
sin
for
the
rest
since
good
wine
needs
no
bush
and
an
inferior
beverage
is
not
likely
to
be
bettered

arboreal

i

most
illustrious
isabella

indomitable
alfonso

and
duchess
dowager
of

here
begins
in
auspicious
wise
the
prologue
the
prologue
a
sa
dame
inasmuch
as
it
was
by
your
command
illustrious
and
exalted
lady
that
i
have
gathered
together
these
stories
to
form
the
present
little
book
you
should
the
less
readily
suppose
i
have
presumed
to
dedicate
to
your
serenity
this
trivial
offering
because
of
my
esteeming
it
to
be
not
undeserving
of
your
acceptance
the
truth
is
otherwise
your
postulant
approaches
not
spurred
toward
you
by
vainglory
but
rather
by
equity
and
equity
plain
need
to
acknowledge
that
he
who
seeks
to
write
of
noble
ladies
must
necessarily
implore
at
outset
the
patronage
of
her
who
is
the
light
and
mainstay
of
our
age
i
humbly
bring
my
book
to
you
as
phidyle
approached
another
and
less
sacred
shrine
pio
et
saliente
and
lay
before
you
this
my
valueless
mean
tribute
not
as
appropriate
to
you
but
as
the
best
i
have
to
offer
it
is
a
little
book
wherein
i
treat
of
divers
queens
and
of
their
and
with
necessitated
candor
i
concede
my
chosen
field
to
have
been
harvested
and
scrupulously
gleaned
by
many
writers
of
innumerable
conditions
since
dares
phrygius
wrote
of
queen
heleine
and
virgil
that
shrewd
necromancer
of
queen
dido
a
preponderating
mass
of
clerks
in
casting
about
for
high
and
serious
matter
have
chosen
as
though
it
were
by
common
instinct
to
dilate
upon
the
amours
of
royal
women
even
in
romance
we
scribblers
must
contrive
it
so
that
the
fair
nicolete
shall
be
discovered
in
the
end
to
be
no
less
than
the
daughter
of
carthage
and
that
sir
doön
of
mayence
shall
never
sink
in
his
love
affairs
beneath
the
degree
of
a
saracen
princess
and
we
are
backed
in
this
old
procedure
not
only
by
the
authority
of
aristotle
but
oddly
enough
by
that
of
reason
kings
have
their
policies
and
wars
wherewith
to
drug
each
human
appetite
but
their
consorts
are
denied
these
makeshifts
and
love
may
rationally
be
defined
as
the
pivot
of
each
normal
woman
life
and
in
consequence
as
the
arbiter
of
that
ensuing
life
which
is
eternal
because
as
anciently
propertius
demanded
though
not
to
speak
the
truth
of
any
woman
quo
fugis
ah
demens
nulla
est
fuga
tu
licet
usque
ad
tanaim
fugias
usque
sequetur
amor
and
a
dairymaid
let
us
say
may
love
whom
she
will
and
nobody
else
be
a
penny
the
worse
for
her
mistaking
of
the
preferable
nail
whereon
to
hang
her
affections
whereas
with
a
queen
this
choice
is
more
portentous
she
plays
the
game
of
life
upon
a
loftier
table
ruthlessly
illuminated
she
stakes
by
her
least
movement
a
tall
pile
of
counters
some
of
which
are
of
necessity
the
lives
and
happiness
of
persons
whom
she
knows
not
unless
it
be
by
vague
report
grandeur
sells
itself
at
this
hard
price
and
at
no
other
a
queen
must
always
play
in
fine
as
the
vicar
of
destiny
free
to
choose
but
very
certainly
compelled
in
the
ensuing
action
to
justify
that
choice
as
is
strikingly
manifested
by
the
authentic
histories
of
brunhalt
and
of
guenevere
and
of
swart
cleopatra
and
of
many
others
that
were
born
to
the
barbaric
queenhoods
of
extinct
and
dusty
times
all
royal
persons
are
i
take
it
the
immediate
and
the
responsible
stewards
of
heaven
and
since
the
nature
of
each
man
is
like
a
troubled
stream
now
muddied
and
now
clear
their
prayer
must
ever
be
me
dios
de
yes
of
exalted
people
and
even
of
their
near
associates
life
because
it
aims
more
high
than
the
aforementioned
aristotle
demands
upon
occasion
a
more
great
catharsis
which
would
purge
any
audience
of
unmanliness
through
pity
and
through
terror
because
by
a
quaint
paradox
the
players
have
been
purged
of
humanity
for
a
moment
destiny
has
thrust
her
scepter
into
the
hands
of
a
human
being
and
chance
has
exalted
a
human
being
to
decide
the
issue
of
many
human
lives
these
two
with
what
immortal
chucklings
one
may
facilely
imagine
have
left
the
weakling
thus
enthroned
free
to
direct
the
heavy
outcome
free
to
choose
and
free
to
evoke
much
happiness
or
weeping
but
with
no
intermediate
course
unbarred
prove
saith
destiny
and
chance
appends
prove
thyself
to
be
at
bottom
a
god
or
else
a
beast
and
now
eternally
abide
that
choice
and
o
crowning
irony
may
not
tell
thee
clearly
by
which
choice
thou
mayst
prove
in
this
little
book
about
the
women
who
intermarried
not
very
enviably
with
an
unhuman
race
a
race
predestinate
to
the
red
ending
which
i
have
chronicled
elsewhere
in
red
it
is
of
ten
such
moments
that
i
treat
you
alone
i
think
of
all
persons
living
have
learned
as
you
have
settled
by
so
many
instances
to
rise
above
mortality
in
such
a
testing
and
unfailingly
to
merit
by
your
conduct
the
plaudits
and
the
adoration
of
our
otherwise
dissentient
world
you
have
often
spoken
in
the
stead
of
destiny
with
nations
to
abide
your
verdict
and
in
so
doing
have
both
graced
and
hallowed
your
high
vicarship
if
i
forbear
to
speak
of
this
at
greater
length
it
is
because
i
dare
not
couple
your
perfection
with
any
imperfect
encomium
upon
no
plea
however
can
any
one
forbear
to
acknowledge
that
he
who
seeks
to
write
of
noble
ladies
must
necessarily
implore
at
outset
the
patronage
of
her
who
is
the
light
and
mainstay
of
our
age
to
you
madame
most
excellent
and
noble
lady
to
whom
i
love
to
owe
both
loyalty
and
love
i

this

the
first
alianora
of
provence
coming
in
disguise
and
in
adversity
to
a
certain
clerk
is
by
him
conducted
across
a
hostile
country
and
in
that
troubled
journey
are
made
manifest
to
each
the
snares
which
had
beguiled
them
aforetime
the
story
of
the
sestina
in
this
place
we
have
to
do
with
the
opening
tale
of
the
dizain
of
queens
i
abridge
as
afterward
at
discretion
and
an
initial
account
of
the
barons
war
among
other
superfluities
i
amputate
as
more
remarkable
for
veracity
than
interest
the
result
we
will
agree
at
outset
is
that
to
the
norman
cleric
appertains
whatever
these
tales
may
have
of
merit
whereas
what
you
find
distasteful
in
them
you
must
impute
to
my
delinquencies
in
skill
rather
than
in
volition
within
the
half
hour
after
de
giars
death
here
one
overtakes
nicolas
in
narrative
dame
alianora
thus
stood
alone
in
the
corridor
of
a
strange
house
beyond
the
arras
the
steward
and
his
lord
were
at
irritable
converse
first
if
the
woman
be
hungry
spoke
a
high
and
peevish
voice
feed
her
if
she
need
money
give
it
to
her
but
do
not
annoy
me
this
woman
demands
to
see
the
master
of
the
house
the
steward
then
retorted
o
incredible
boeotian
inform
her
that
the
master
of
the
house
has
no
time
to
waste
upon
vagabonds
who
select
the
middle
of
the
night
as
an
eligible
time
to
pop
out
of
nowhere
why
did
you
not
do
so
in
the
beginning
you
dolt
the
speaker
got
for
answer
only
a
deferential
cough
and
very
shortly
continued
this
is
remarkably
vexatious
et
praeterea
which
signifies
yeck
that
to
converse
with
women
is
always
delightful
admit
her
this
was
done
and
dame
alianora
came
into
an
apartment
littered
with
papers
where
a
neat
and
shriveled
gentleman
of
sat
at
a
desk
and
scowled
he
presently
said
you
may
go
yeck
he
had
risen
the
magisterial
attitude
with
which
he
had
awaited
her
entrance
cast
aside
oh
god
he
said
you
madame
his
thin
hands
scholarly
hands
were
plucking
at
the
air
dame
alianora
had
paused
greatly
astonished
and
there
was
an
interval
before
she
said
i
do
not
recognize
you
messire
and
yet
madame
i
recall
very
clearly
that
some
thirty
years
ago
the
raymond
bérenger
then
reigning
in
provence
had
about
his
court
four
daughters
each
one
of
whom
was
afterward
wedded
to
a
king
first
meregrett
the
eldest
now
regnant
in
france
then
alianora
the
second
and
most
beautiful
of
these
daughters
whom
troubadours
hymned
as
the
unattainable
princess
she
was
married
a
long
while
ago
madame
to
the
king
of
england
lord
henry
third
of
that
name
to
reign
in
these
islands
dame
alianora
eyes
were
narrowing
there
is
something
in
your
voice
she
said
which
i
recall
he
answered
madame
and
queen
that
is
very
likely
for
it
is
a
voice
which
sang
a
deal
in
provence
when
both
of
us
were
younger
i
concede
with
the
roman
that
i
have
somewhat
deteriorated
since
the
reign
of
cynara
yet
have
you
quite
forgotten
the
englishman
who
made
so
many
songs
of
you
they
called
him
osmund
heleigh
he
made
the
sestina
of
spring
which
won
the
violet
crown
at
my
betrothal
the
queen
said
and
then
with
eagerness
messire
can
it
be
that
you
are
osmund
heleigh
he
shrugged
assent
she
looked
at
him
for
a
long
time
rather
sadly
and
demanded
if
he
were
the
king
man
or
of
the
barons
party
the
nervous
hands
were
raised
in
deprecation
i
have
no
politics
messire
heleigh
began
and
altered
it
gallantly
enough
to
i
am
the
queen
man
madame
then
aid
me
osmund
she
said
he
answered
with
a
gravity
which
singularly
became
him
you
have
reason
to
understand
that
to
my
fullest
power
i
will
aid
you
you
know
that
at
lewes
these
swine
overcame
us
he
nodded
assent
now
they
hold
the
king
my
husband
captive
at
kenilworth
i
am
content
that
he
remain
there
for
he
is
of
all
the
king
enemies
the
most
dangerous
but
at
wallingford
leicester
has
imprisoned
my
son
prince
edward
the
prince
must
be
freed
my
osmund
warren
de
basingbourne
commands
what
is
left
of
the
royal
army
now
entrenched
at
bristol
and
it
is
he
who
must
liberate
my
son
get
me
to
bristol
then
afterward
we
will
take
wallingford
the
queen
issued
these
orders
in
cheery
practical
fashion
and
did
not
admit
opposition
into
the
account
for
she
was
a
capable
woman
but
you
madame
he
stammered
you
came
alone
i
come
from
france
where
i
have
been
entreating
and
vainly
entreating
succor
from
yet
another
monkish
king
the
holy
lewis
of
that
realm
eh
what
is
god
about
when
he
enthrones
these
whining
pieties
were
i
a
king
were
i
even
a
man
i
would
drive
these
smug
english
out
of
their
foggy
isle
in
three
days
space
i
would
leave
alive
not
one
of
these
curs
that
dare
yelp
at
me
i
would
she
paused
anger
veering
into
amusement
see
how
i
enrage
myself
when
i
think
of
what
your
people
have
made
me
suffer
the
queen
said
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
in
effect
i
skulked
back
in
disguise
to
this
detestable
island
accompanied
by
avenel
de
giars
and
hubert
some
fellows
robbers
thorough
knaves
like
all
you
english
attacked
us
on
the
common
yonder
and
slew
the
men
of
our
party
while
they
were
cutting
de
giars
throat
i
slipped
away
in
the
dark
and
tumbled
through
many
ditches
till
i
spied
your
light
there
you
have
my
story
now
get
me
an
escort
to
bristol
it
was
a
long
while
before
messire
heleigh
spoke
then
these
men
he
said
this
de
giars
and
this
they
gave
their
lives
for
yours
as
i
understand
it
caris
and
yet
you
do
not
grieve
for
them
i
shall
regret
de
giars
the
queen
acknowledged
for
he
made
excellent
songs
but
foh
the
man
had
a
face
like
a
horse
again
her
mood
changed
many
persons
have
died
for
me
my
friend
at
first
i
wept
for
them
but
now
i
am
dry
of
tears
he
shook
his
head
cato
very
wisely
says
thou
hast
need
of
help
ask
it
of
thy
friends
but
the
sweet
friend
that
i
remember
was
a
clean
eyed
girl
joyous
and
exceedingly
beautiful
now
you
appear
to
me
one
of
those
ladies
of
remoter
times
faustina
or
jael
or
artemis
the
wife
of
tauris
they
that
slew
men
laughing
i
am
somewhat
afraid
of
you
madame
she
was
angry
at
first
then
her
face
softened
you
english
she
said
only
half
mirthful
eh
my
god
you
remember
me
when
i
was
a
high
hearted
young
sorceress
now
the
powers
of
the
apsarasas
have
departed
from
me
and
time
has
thrust
that
alianora
who
was
once
the
unattainable
princess
chin
deep
in
misery
yet
even
now
i
am
your
queen
messire
and
it
is
not
yours
to
pass
judgment
upon
me
i
do
not
judge
you
he
returned
rather
i
cry
with
him
of
old
incerta
ratione
and
i
cry
with
salomon
that
he
who
meddles
with
the
strife
of
another
man
is
like
to
him
that
takes
a
hound
by
the
ears
yet
listen
madame
and
queen
i
can
not
afford
you
an
escort
to
bristol
this
house
of
which
i
am
in
temporary
charge
is
longaville
my
manor
lord
brudenel
as
you
doubtless
know
is
of
the
barons
party
and
scant
cause
for
grief
is
with
leicester
at
this
moment
i
can
trust
none
of
my
brother
people
for
i
believe
them
to
be
of
much
the
same
opinion
as
those
londoners
who
not
long
ago
stoned
you
and
would
have
sunk
your
barge
in
thames
river
oh
let
us
not
blink
the
fact
that
you
are
not
overbeloved
in
england
so
an
escort
is
out
of
the
question
yet
i
madame
if
you
so
elect
will
see
you
safe
to
bristol
you
singly
the
queen
demanded
my
plan
is
this
singing
folk
alone
travel
whither
they
will
we
will
go
as
jongleurs
then
i
can
yet
manage
a
song
to
the
viol
i
dare
affirm
and
you
must
pass
as
my
wife
he
said
this
with
simplicity
the
plan
seemed
unreasonable
and
at
first
dame
alianora
waved
it
aside
out
of
the
question
but
reflection
suggested
nothing
better
it
was
impossible
to
remain
at
longaville
and
the
man
spoke
sober
truth
when
he
declared
any
escort
other
than
himself
to
be
unprocurable
besides
the
lunar
madness
of
the
scheme
was
its
strength
that
the
queen
would
venture
to
cross
half
england
unprotected
and
messire
heleigh
on
the
face
of
him
was
a
buckler
was
an
event
which
leicester
would
neither
anticipate
nor
on
report
credit
there
you
were
these
english
had
no
imagination
the
queen
snapped
her
fingers
and
said
very
willingly
will
i
be
your
wife
my
osmund
but
how
do
i
know
that
i
can
trust
you
leicester
would
give
a
deal
for
me
he
would
pay
any
price
for
the
pious
joy
of
burning
the
sorceress
of
provence
and
you
are
not
wealthy
i
suspect
you
may
trust
me
mon
bel
esper
his
eyes
here
were
those
of
a
beaten
child
because
my
memory
is
better
than
yours
messire
osmund
heleigh
gathered
his
papers
into
a
neat
pile
this
room
is
mine
i
keep
guard
in
the
corridor
madame
we
will
start
at
dawn
when
he
had
gone
dame
alianora
laughed
contentedly
mon
bel
esper
my
fairest
hope
the
man
called
me
that
in
his
verses
thirty
years
ago
yes
i
may
trust
you
my
poor
osmund
so
they
set
out
at
cockcrow
he
had
procured
for
himself
a
viol
and
a
long
falchion
and
had
somewhere
got
suitable
clothes
for
the
queen
and
in
their
aging
but
decent
garb
the
two
approached
near
enough
to
the
appearance
of
what
they
desired
to
be
thought
in
the
courtyard
a
knot
of
servants
gaped
nudged
one
another
but
openly
said
nothing
messire
heleigh
as
they
interpreted
it
was
brazening
out
an
affair
of
gallantry
before
the
countryside
and
they
esteemed
his
casual
observation
that
they
would
find
a
couple
of
dead
men
on
the
common
exceedingly
diverting
when
the
queen
asked
him
the
same
morning
and
what
will
you
sing
my
osmund
shall
we
begin
the
practise
of
our
new
profession
with
the
sestina
of
spring
old
osmund
heleigh
grunted
out
i
have
forgotten
that
rubbish
long
ago
amans
saith
the
satirist
of
rome
town
and
with
reason
followed
silence
one
sees
them
thus
trudging
the
brown
naked
plains
under
a
sky
of
steel
in
a
pageant
the
woman
and
comely
her
russet
gown
girded
up
like
a
harvester
might
not
inaptly
have
prefigured
october
and
for
less
comfortable
november
you
could
nowhere
have
found
a
symbol
more
precise
than
her
lank
companion
humorously
peevish
under
his
white
thatch
of
hair
and
constantly
fretted
by
the
sword
tapping
at
his
ankles
they
made
hurlburt
prosperously
and
found
it
vacant
for
the
news
of
falmouth
advance
had
driven
the
villagers
hillward
there
was
in
this
place
a
child
a
naked
boy
of
some
two
years
lying
on
a
doorstep
overlooked
in
his
elders
gross
terror
as
the
queen
with
a
sob
lifted
this
boy
the
child
died
starved
said
osmund
heleigh
and
within
a
stone
throw
of
my
snug
home
the
queen
laid
down
the
tiny
corpse
and
stooping
lightly
caressed
its
sparse
flaxen
hair
she
answered
nothing
though
her
lips
moved
past
vachel
scene
of
a
recent
skirmish
with
many
dead
in
the
gutters
they
were
overtaken
by
falmouth
himself
and
stood
at
the
roadside
to
afford
his
troop
passage
the
marquess
as
he
went
by
flung
the
queen
a
coin
with
a
jest
sufficiently
high
flavored
she
knew
the
man
her
inveterate
enemy
knew
that
on
recognition
he
would
have
killed
her
as
he
would
a
wolf
she
smiled
at
him
and
dropped
a
curtsey
this
is
remarkable
messire
heleigh
observed
i
was
hideously
afraid
and
am
yet
shaking
but
you
madame
laughed
the
queen
replied
i
laughed
because
i
know
that
some
day
i
shall
have
lord
falmouth
head
it
will
be
very
sweet
to
see
it
roll
in
the
dust
my
osmund
messire
heleigh
somewhat
dryly
observed
that
tastes
differed
at
jessop
minor
befell
a
more
threatening
adventure
seeking
food
at
the
and
in
that
village
they
blundered
upon
the
same
troop
at
dinner
in
the
square
about
the
inn
falmouth
and
his
lieutenants
were
somewhere
inside
the
house
the
men
greeted
the
supposed
purveyors
of
amusement
with
a
shout
and
one
of
these
soldiers
a
swarthy
rascal
with
his
head
tied
in
a
napkin
demanded
that
the
jongleurs
grace
their
meal
with
a
song
osmund
tried
to
put
him
off
with
a
tale
of
a
broken
viol
but
haro
the
fellow
blustered
by
blood
and
by
nails
you
will
sing
more
sweetly
with
a
broken
viol
than
with
a
broken
head
i
would
have
you
understand
you
hedge
thief
that
we
gentlemen
of
the
sword
are
not
partial
to
wordy
argument
messire
heleigh
fluttered
inefficient
hands
as
the
gathered
about
them
scenting
some
genial
piece
of
cruelty
oh
you
rabbit
the
trooper
jeered
and
caught
at
throat
shaking
him
in
the
act
this
rascal
tore
open
messire
tunic
disclosing
a
thin
chain
about
his
neck
and
a
handsome
locket
which
the
fellow
wrested
from
its
fastening
ahoi
he
continued
ahoi
my
comrades
what
sort
of
minstrel
is
this
who
goes
about
england
all
hung
with
gold
like
a
cathedral
virgin
he
and
his
sweetheart
the
actual
word
was
grosser
will
be
none
the
worse
for
an
interview
with
the
marquess
the
situation
smacked
of
awkwardness
because
lord
falmouth
was
familiar
with
the
queen
and
to
be
brought
specifically
to
his
attention
meant
death
for
two
detected
masqueraders
hastily
osmund
heleigh
said
messire
the
locket
contains
the
portrait
of
a
lady
whom
in
my
youth
i
loved
very
greatly
save
to
me
it
is
valueless
i
pray
you
do
not
rob
me
of
it
but
the
trooper
shook
his
head
with
drunken
solemnity
i
do
not
like
the
looks
of
this
yet
i
will
sell
it
to
you
as
the
saying
is
for
a
song
it
shall
be
the
king
of
songs
said
osmund
the
song
that
arnaut
daniel
first
made
i
will
sing
for
you
a
sestina
messieurs
a
sestina
in
salutation
of
spring
the
men
disposed
themselves
about
the
dying
grass
and
presently
he
sang
sang
messire
heleigh
awaken
for
the
servitors
of
spring
proclaim
his
triumph
ah
make
haste
to
see
with
what
tempestuous
pageantry
they
bring
the
victor
homeward
haste
for
this
is
he
that
cast
out
winter
and
all
woes
that
cling
to
winter
garments
and
bade
april
be
and
now
that
spring
is
master
let
us
be
content
and
laugh
as
anciently
in
spring
the
tristan
laughed
when
he
was
come
again
to
bring
glad
news
of
arthur
victory
and
see
ysoude
with
parted
lips
that
waver
and
cling
not
yet
in
brittany
must
tristan
cling
to
this
or
that
sad
memory
and
be
alone
as
she
in
cornwall
for
in
spring
love
sows
against
far
harvestings
and
he
is
blind
and
scatters
baleful
seed
that
bring
such
fruitage
as
blind
love
lacks
eyes
to
see
osmund
paused
here
for
an
appreciable
interval
staring
at
the
queen
you
saw
his
flabby
throat
his
eyes
melting
saw
his
cheeks
kindle
and
youth
seeping
into
the
lean
man
like
water
over
a
crumbling
dam
his
voice
was
now
big
and
desirous
sang
messire
heleigh
love
sows
but
lovers
reap
and
ye
will
see
the
loved
eyes
lighten
feel
the
loved
lips
cling
never
again
when
in
the
grave
ye
be
incurious
of
your
happiness
in
spring
and
get
no
grace
of
love
there
whither
he
that
bartered
life
for
love
no
love
may
bring
no
braggart
heracles
avails
to
bring
alcestis
hence
nor
here
may
roland
see
the
eyes
of
aude
nor
here
the
wakening
spring
vex
any
man
with
memories
for
there
be
no
memories
that
cling
as
cerements
cling
no
force
that
baffles
death
more
strong
than
he
us
hath
he
noted
and
for
us
hath
he
an
hour
appointed
and
that
hour
will
bring
then
laugh
laugh
dear
and
see
the
tyrant
mocked
while
yet
our
bosoms
cling
while
yet
our
lips
obey
us
and
we
be
untrammeled
in
our
little
hour
of
spring
thus
in
the
spring
we
jeer
at
death
though
he
will
see
our
children
perish
and
will
briny
asunder
all
that
cling
while
love
may
be
then
osmund
put
the
viol
aside
and
sat
quite
silent
the
soldiery
judged
and
with
cordial
frankness
stated
that
the
difficulty
of
his
rhyming
scheme
did
not
atone
for
his
lack
of
indecency
but
when
the
queen
of
england
went
among
them
with
messire
heleigh
faded
green
hat
she
found
them
liberal
even
the
fellow
with
the
broken
head
admitted
that
a
bargain
was
proverbially
a
bargain
and
returned
the
locket
with
the
addition
of
a
coin
so
for
the
present
these
two
went
safe
and
quitted
the
and
fed
and
unmolested
my
osmund
dame
alianora
said
presently
your
memory
is
better
than
i
had
thought
i
remembered
a
boy
and
a
girl
he
returned
and
i
grieved
that
they
were
dead
afterward
they
plodded
on
toward
bowater
and
the
ensuing
night
rested
in
chantrell
wood
they
had
the
good
fortune
there
to
encounter
dry
and
windless
weather
and
a
sufficiency
of
brushwood
with
which
osmund
constructed
an
agreeable
fire
in
its
glow
these
two
sat
eating
bread
and
cheese
but
talk
languished
at
the
outset
the
queen
had
complained
of
an
ague
and
messire
heleigh
was
sedately
suggesting
three
spiders
hung
about
the
neck
as
an
infallible
corrective
for
this
ailment
when
dame
alianora
rose
to
her
feet
eh
my
god
she
said
i
am
wearied
of
such
ungracious
aid
not
an
inch
of
the
way
but
you
have
been
thinking
of
your
filthy
books
and
longing
to
be
back
at
them
no
i
except
the
moments
when
you
were
frightened
into
forgetfulness
first
by
falmouth
then
by
the
trooper
o
eternal
father
afraid
of
a
single
dirty
soldier
indeed
i
was
very
much
afraid
said
messire
heleigh
with
perfect
simplicity
perire
you
have
not
even
the
grace
to
be
ashamed
yet
i
am
shamed
messire
that
osmund
heleigh
should
have
become
the
pedant
you
are
for
i
loved
young
osmund
heleigh
he
also
had
risen
in
the
firelight
and
now
its
convulsive
shadows
marred
two
dogged
faces
i
think
it
best
not
to
recall
that
boy
and
girl
who
are
so
long
dead
and
frankly
madame
and
queen
the
merit
of
the
business
i
have
in
hand
is
questionable
it
is
you
who
have
set
all
england
by
the
ears
and
i
am
guiding
you
toward
opportunities
for
further
mischief
i
must
serve
you
understand
madame
that
ancient
folly
in
provence
yonder
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
affair
count
manuel
left
you
and
between
his
evasion
and
your
marriage
you
were
pleased
to
amuse
yourself
with
me
you
were
more
civil
then
my
osmund
i
am
not
uncivil
i
merely
point
out
that
this
old
folly
constitutes
no
overwhelming
obligation
either
way
i
cry
ad
andromachen
for
the
rest
i
must
serve
you
because
you
are
a
woman
and
helpless
yet
i
can
not
forget
that
he
who
spares
the
wolf
is
the
sheep
murderer
it
would
be
better
for
all
england
if
you
were
dead
hey
your
gorgeous
follies
madame
silver
peacocks
set
with
sapphires
cloth
of
fine
gold
would
you
have
me
go
unclothed
dame
alianora
demanded
pettishly
not
so
osmund
retorted
again
i
say
to
you
with
tertullian
women
paint
their
eyes
with
the
tints
of
chastity
insert
into
their
ears
the
word
of
god
tie
the
yoke
of
christ
about
their
necks
and
adorn
their
whole
person
with
the
silk
of
sanctity
and
the
damask
of
devotion
i
say
to
you
that
the
boy
you
wish
to
rescue
from
wallingford
and
make
king
of
england
is
freely
rumored
to
be
not
verily
the
son
of
sire
henry
but
the
child
of
tall
manuel
of
poictesme
i
say
to
you
that
from
the
first
you
have
made
mischief
in
england
and
i
say
to
you
but
dame
alianora
was
yawning
quite
frankly
you
will
say
to
me
that
i
brought
foreigners
into
england
that
i
misguided
the
king
that
i
stirred
up
strife
between
the
king
and
his
barons
eh
my
god
i
am
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
harangue
yet
listen
my
osmund
they
sold
me
like
a
bullock
to
a
man
i
had
never
seen
i
found
him
a
man
of
wax
and
i
remoulded
him
they
asked
of
me
an
heir
for
england
i
provided
that
heir
they
gave
me
england
as
a
toy
i
played
with
it
i
was
the
queen
the
source
of
honor
the
source
of
wealth
the
trough
in
effect
about
which
swine
gathered
never
since
i
came
into
england
osmund
has
any
man
or
woman
loved
me
never
in
all
my
english
life
have
i
loved
man
or
woman
do
you
understand
my
osmund
the
queen
has
many
flatterers
but
no
friends
not
a
friend
in
the
world
my
osmund
and
so
the
queen
made
the
best
of
it
and
amused
herself
somewhat
he
seemed
to
understand
for
he
answered
without
asperity
mon
bel
esper
i
do
not
find
it
anywhere
in
holy
writ
that
god
requires
it
of
us
to
amuse
ourselves
but
upon
many
occasions
we
have
been
commanded
to
live
righteously
we
are
tempted
in
divers
and
insidious
ways
and
we
cry
with
the
psalmist
strength
is
dried
up
like
a
potsherd
but
god
intends
this
since
until
we
have
here
demonstrated
our
valor
upon
satan
we
are
manifestly
unworthy
to
be
enregistered
in
god
army
the
great
captain
must
be
served
by
proven
soldiers
we
may
be
tempted
but
we
may
not
yield
o
daughter
of
the
south
we
must
not
yield
again
you
preach
dame
alianora
said
that
is
a
venerable
truism
ho
madame
he
returned
is
it
on
that
account
the
less
true
pensively
the
queen
considered
this
you
are
a
good
man
my
osmund
she
said
at
last
though
you
are
very
droll
ohimé
it
is
a
pity
that
i
was
born
a
princess
had
it
been
possible
for
me
to
be
your
wife
i
would
have
been
a
better
woman
i
shall
sleep
now
and
dream
of
that
good
and
stupid
and
contented
woman
i
might
have
been
so
presently
these
two
slept
in
chantrell
wood
followed
four
days
of
journeying
as
messer
dante
had
not
yet
surveyed
malebolge
osmund
heleigh
and
dame
alianora
lacked
a
parallel
for
that
which
they
encountered
their
traverse
discovered
england
razed
charred
and
depopulate
picked
bones
of
an
island
a
vast
and
absolute
ruin
about
which
men
skulked
like
rats
messire
heleigh
and
the
queen
traveled
without
molestation
malice
and
death
had
journeyed
before
them
on
this
road
and
had
swept
it
clear
at
every
trace
of
these
hideous
precessors
osmund
heleigh
would
say
by
a
day
ride
i
might
have
prevented
this
or
by
a
day
ride
i
might
have
saved
this
woman
or
by
two
days
riding
i
might
have
fed
this
child
the
queen
kept
spartan
silence
but
daily
you
saw
the
fine
woman
age
in
their
slow
advance
every
inch
of
misery
was
thrust
before
her
for
inspection
meticulously
she
observed
and
evaluated
her
handiwork
enthroned
she
had
appraised
from
a
distance
the
righteous
wars
she
set
afoot
trudging
thus
among
the
débris
of
these
wars
she
found
they
had
unsuspected
aspects
bastling
the
royal
army
had
recently
sacked
there
remained
of
this
village
the
skeletons
of
two
houses
and
for
the
rest
a
jumble
of
bricks
rafters
many
calcined
fragments
of
humanity
and
ashes
at
bastling
messire
heleigh
turned
to
the
queen
toiling
behind
oh
madame
he
said
in
a
dry
whisper
this
was
the
home
of
so
many
men
i
burned
it
dame
alianora
replied
that
man
we
passed
just
now
i
killed
those
other
men
and
women
my
folly
slew
them
all
and
little
children
my
osmund
the
hair
like
flax
oh
madame
he
wailed
in
the
extremity
of
his
pity
for
she
stood
with
eyes
shut
all
gray
the
queen
demanded
why
have
they
not
slain
me
was
there
no
man
in
england
to
strangle
the
proud
wanton
are
you
all
cowards
here
he
said
i
detect
only
one
coward
in
the
affair
your
men
and
leicester
men
also
ride
about
the
world
and
draw
sword
and
slay
and
die
for
the
right
as
they
see
it
and
you
and
leicester
contend
for
the
right
as
ye
see
it
but
i
madame
i
i
who
sat
snug
at
home
spilling
ink
and
trimming
god
world
madame
and
i
in
it
afraid
to
speak
a
word
for
him
god
world
and
a
curmudgeon
in
it
grudging
god
the
life
he
gave
the
man
flung
out
his
soft
hands
and
snarled
we
are
tempted
in
divers
and
insidious
but
i
who
rebuked
you
behold
now
with
how
gross
a
snare
was
i
entrapped
i
do
not
understand
my
osmund
i
was
afraid
madame
he
returned
dully
everywhere
men

and
i
am
afraid
to
die
so
they
stood
silent
in
the
ruins
of
bastling
of
a
piece
with
our
lives
dame
alianora
said
at
last
all
ruin
my
osmund
but
messire
heleigh
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
new
color
in
his
face
presently
men
will
build
here
my
queen
presently
as
in
legend
was
the
arabian
bird
arises
from
these
ashes
a
lordlier
and
more

they
went
forward
the
next

loosed
upon
them
gui

lord
of
bozon
foliot
and
thwenge
who
riding
alone
through
poges
copse
found
there
a
man
and
a
woman
over
their
limited
supper
the
woman
had
thrown
back
her
hood
and
camoys
drew
rein
to
stare
at
her
lispingly
he
spoke
the
true
court
dialect
ma
belle
said
this
camoys
in
friendly
condescension
vous

dame
alianora
smiled
up
at
him
ouais
messire
mon

faict
les

she
paused
with
dilatory
caution
for
camoys
had
leaped
from
his
horse
giving
a
great
laugh
a
prize
ho
an
imperial
prize
camoys
shouted
a
peasant
woman
with
the
queen
face
who
speaks
french
and
who
madame
is
this
have
you
by
any
chance
brought
pious
lewis
from
oversea
have
i
bagged
a
brace
of
monarchs
here
was
imminent
danger
for
camoys
had
known
the
queen
some
fifteen
years
messire
heleigh
rose
his
five
days
beard
glinting
like
as
his
mouth
twitched
i
am
osmund
heleigh
messire
younger
brother
to
the
earl
of
brudenel
i
have
heard
of
you
i
believe
the
fellow
who
spoils
parchment
this
is
odd
company
however
messire
osmund
for
brudenel
brother
a
gentleman
must
serve
his
queen
messire
as
cicero
very
justly
observes
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
his
political
opinions
are
scarcely
to
our
immediate
purpose
this
is
a
high
matter
messire
heleigh
to
let
the
sorceress
pass
is
of
course
out
of
the
question
upon
the
other
hand
i
observe
that
you
lack
weapons
of
defence
yet
if
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
assist
me
in
unarming
your
courtesy
will
place
our
commerce
on
more
equal
footing
osmund
had
turned
very
white
i
am
no
swordsman
messire
now
this
is
not
handsome
of
you
camoys
began
i
warn
you
that
people
will
speak
harshly
of
us
if
we
lose
this
opportunity
of
gaining
honor
and
besides
the
woman
will
be
burned
at
the
stake
plainly
you
owe
it
to
all
three
of
us
to
fight
but
i
refer
my
cause
to
god
i
am
quite
at
your
service
no
my
osmund
dame
alianora
then
cried
it
means
your
death
he
spread
out
his
hands
that
is
god
affair
madame
are
you
not
afraid
she
breathed
of
course
i
am
afraid
said
messire
heleigh
irritably
after
that
he
unarmed
camoys
and
presently
they
faced
each
other
in
their
tunics
so
for
the
first
time
in
the
journey
osmund
long
falchion
saw
daylight
he
had
thrown
away
his
dagger
as
camoys
had
none
the
combat
was
sufficiently
curious
camoys
raised
his
left
hand
so
help
me
god
and
his
saints
i
have
upon
me
neither
bone
stone
nor
witchcraft
wherethrough
the
power
and
the
word
of
god
might
be
diminished
or
the
devil
power
increased
osmund
made
similar
oath
judge
thou
this
woman
cause
he
cried
likewise
then
gui
camoys
shouted
as
a
herald
might
have
done
laissez
les
aller
laissez
les
aller
laissez
les
aller
les
bons
combatants
and
warily
each
moved
toward
the
other
on
a
sudden
osmund
attacked
desperately
apprehensive
of
his
own
cowardice
camoys
lightly
eluded
him
and
slashed
at
osmund
undefended
thigh
drawing
much
blood
osmund
gasped
he
flung
away
his
sword
and
in
the
instant
catching
camoys
under
the
arms
threw
him
to
the
ground
messire
heleigh
fell
with
his
opponent
who
in
stumbling
had
lost
his
sword
and
thus
the
two
struggled
unarmed
osmund
atop
but
camoys
was
the
younger
man
and
osmund
strength
was
ebbing
rapidly
by
reason
of
his
wound
now
camoys
tethered
horse
rearing
with
nervousness
tumbled
his
master
helmet
into
the
road
osmund
caught
up
this
helmet
and
with
it
battered
camoys
in
the
face
dealing
severe
blows
god
camoys
cried
his
face
all
blood
do
you
acknowledge
my
quarrel
just
said
osmund
between
horrid
sobs
what
choice
have
i
said
gui
camoys
very
sensibly
so
osmund
rose
blind
with
tears
and
shivering
the
queen
bound
up
their
wounds
as
best
she
might
but
camoys
was
much
dissatisfied
for
private
purposes
of
his
own
madame
he
observed
and
doubtless
for
sufficient
reasons
god
has
singularly
favored
your
cause
i
am
neither
a
fool
nor
a
pagan
to
question
his
decision
and
you
two
may
go
your
way
unhampered
but
i
have
had
my
head
broken
with
my
own
helmet
and
this
i
consider
to
be
a
proceeding
very
little
conducive
toward
enhancing
my
reputation
of
your
courtesy
messire
i
must
entreat
another
meeting
osmund
shrank
as
if
from
a
blow
then
with
a
short
laugh
he
conceded
that
this
was
camoys
right
and
they
fixed
upon
the
following
saturday
with
poges
copse
as
the
rendezvous
i
would
suggest
that
the
combat
be
to
the
death
gui
camoys
said
in
consideration
of
the
fact
it
was
my
own
helmet
you
must
undoubtedly
be
aware
messire
osmund
that
such
an
affront
is
practically
without
any
parallel
this
too
was
agreed
upon
then
after
asking
if
they
needed
money
which
was
courteously
declined
gui
camoys
rode
away
and
sang
as
he
went
osmund
heleigh
remained
motionless
he
raised
quivering
hands
to
the
sky
thou
hast
judged
he
cried
thou
hast
judged
o
puissant
emperor
of
heaven
now
pardon
pardon
us
twain
pardon
for
unjust
stewards
of
thy
gifts
thou
hast
loaned
this
woman
dominion
over
england
with
all
instruments
to
aid
thy
cause
and
this
trust
she
has
abused
thou
hast
loaned
me
life
and
manhood
agility
and
wit
and
strength
all
instruments
to
aid
thy
cause
talents
in
a
napkin
o
god
repentant
we
cry
to
thee
pardon
for
unjust
stewards
pardon
for
the
ungirt
loin
for
the
service
shirked
for
all
good
deeds
undone
pardon
and
grace
o
king
of
kings
thus
he
prayed
while
gui
camoys
sang
riding
deeper
into
the
tattered
yellowing
forest
by
an
odd
chance
camoys
had
lighted
on
that
song
made
by
thibaut
of
champagne
beginning
saciez
ki
or
ne
which
denounces
all
servitors
of
heaven
and
this
he
sang
with
a
lilt
gayer
than
his
matter
countenanced
faintly
there
now
came
to
osmund
and
the
queen
the
sound
of
camoys
singing
and
they
found
it
in
the
circumstances
ominously
apt
sang
camoys
et

dame

shivered
but
she
was
a
capable
woman
and
so
she
said
i
may
have
made
mistakes
but
i
am
sure
i
never
meant
any
harm
and
i
am
sure
too
that
god
will
be
more
sensible
about
it
than
are
you
poets
they
slept
that
night
in
ousley
meadow
and
the
next
afternoon
came
safely
to
bristol
you
may
learn
elsewhere
with
what
rejoicing
the
royal
army
welcomed
the
queen
arrival
how
courage
quickened
at
sight
of
the
generous
virago
in
the
ebullition
messire
heleigh
was
submerged
and
dame
alianora
saw
nothing
more
of
him
that
day
friday
there
were
counsels
requisitions
orders
signed
a
memorial
despatched
to
pope
urban
chief
of
all
a
letter
this
in
the
queen
hand
throughout
privily
conveyed
to
the
lady
maude
de
mortemer
who
shortly
afterward
contrived
prince
edward
escape
from
her
husband
gaolership
there
was
much
sowing
of
a
seed
in
fine
that
eventually
flowered
victory
there
was
however
no
sign
of
osmund
heleigh
though
by
dame
order
he
was
sought
on
saturday
at
seven
in
the
morning
he
came
to
her
lodging
in
complete
armor
from
the
open
helmet
his
wrinkled
face
showing
like
a
wizened
nut
in
a
shell
smiled
upon
her
questionings
i
go
to
fight
gui
camoys
madame
and
queen
dame
alianora
wrung
her
hands
you
go
to
your
death
he
answered
that
is
true
therefore
i
am
come
to
bid
you
farewell
the
queen
stared
at
him
for
a
while
on
a
sudden
she
broke
into
a
curious
fit
of
deep
but
tearless
sobbing
which
bordered
upon
laughter
too
mon
bel
esper
said
osmund
heleigh
gently
what
is
there
in
all
this
worthy
of
your
sorrow
the
man
will
kill
me
granted
for
he
is
my
junior
by
some
fifteen
years
and
is
in
addition
a
skilled
swordsman
i
fail
to
see
that
this
is
lamentable
back
to
longaville
i
can
not
go
after
recent
happenings
there
a
rope
end
awaits
me
here
i
must
in
any
event
shortly
take
to
the
sword
since
a
beleaguered
army
has
very
little
need
of
and
shortly
i
must
be
slain
in
some
skirmish
dug
under
the
ribs
perhaps
by
a
greasy
fellow
i
have
never
seen
i
prefer
a
clean
death
at
a
gentleman
hands
it
is
i
who
bring
about
your
death
she
said
you
gave
me
gallant
service
and
i
have
requited
you
with
death
and
it
is
a
great
pity
indeed
the
debt
is
on
the
other
side
the
trivial
services
i
rendered
you
were
such
as
any
gentleman
must
render
a
woman
in
distress
naught
else
have
i
afforded
you
madame
save
very
anciently
a
sestina
ho
a
sestina
and
in
return
you
have
given
me
a
sestina
of
fairer
make
a
sestina
of
days
six
days
of
manly
common
living
his
eyes
were
fervent
she
kissed
him
on
either
cheek
farewell
my
champion
ay
your
champion
in
the
twilight
of
life
old
osmund
heleigh
rides
forth
to
defend
the
quarrel
of
alianora
of
provence
reign
wisely
my
queen
so
that
hereafter
men
may
not
say
i
was
slain
in
an
evil
cause
do
not
i
pray
you
shame
my
maiden
venture
at
a
man
work
i
will
not
shame
you
the
queen
proudly
said
and
then
with
a
change
of
voice
o
my
osmund
my
osmund
you
have
a
folly
that
is
divine
and
i
lack
it
he
caught
her
by
each
wrist
and
stood
crushing
both
her
hands
to
his
lips
with
fierce
staring
wife
of
my
king
wife
of
my
king
he
babbled
and
then
put
her
from
him
crying
i
have
not
failed
you
praise
god
i
have
not
failed
you
from
her
window
she
saw
him
ride
away
a
rich
flush
of
glitter
and
color
in
new
armor
with
a
smart
emblazoned
surcoat
the
lean
pedant
sat
conspicuously
erect
and
as
he
went
he
sang
defiantly
taunting
the
weakness
of
his
flesh
sang
osmund
heleigh
love
sows
but
lovers
reap
and
ye
will
see
the
loved
eyes
lighten
feel
the
loved
lips
cling
never
again
when
in
the
grave
ye
be
incurious
of
your
happiness
in
spring
and
get
no
grace
of
love
there
whither
he
that
bartered
life
for
love
no
love
may
bring
so
he
rode
away
and
thus
out
of
our
history
but
in
the
evening
gui
camoys
came
into
bristol
under
a
flag
of
truce
and
behind
him
heaved
a
litter
wherein
lay
osmund
heleigh
body
for
this
man
was
frank
and
courteous
camoys
said
to
the
queen
and
in
the
matter
of
the
reparation
he
owed
me
acted
very
handsomely
it
is
fitting
that
he
should
have
honorable
interment
that
he
shall
not
lack
the
queen
said
and
gently
unclasped
from
osmund
wrinkled
neck
the
thin
gold
chain
now
locketless
there
was
a
portrait
here
she
said
the
portrait
of
a
woman
whom
he
loved
in
his
youth
messire
camoys
and
all
his
life
it
lay
above
his
heart
camoys
answered
stiffly
i
imagine
this
same
locket
to
have
been
the
object
which
messire
heleigh
flung
into
the
river
shortly
before
we
began
our
combat
i
do
not
rob
the
dead
madame
well
the
queen
said
he
always
did
queer
things
and
so
i
shall
always
wonder
what
sort
of
lady
he
picked
out
to
love
but
it
is
none
of
my
affair
afterward
she
set
to
work
on
requisitions
in
the
king
name
but
osmund
heleigh
she
had
interred
at
ambresbury
commanding
it
to
be
written
on
his
tomb
that
he
died
in
the
queen
cause
how
the
same
cause
prospered
nicolas
concludes
how
presently
dame
alianora
reigned
again
in
england
and
with
what
wisdom
and
how
in
the
end
this
great
queen
died
a
nun
at
ambresbury
and
all
england
wept
therefor
this
you
may
learn
elsewhere
i
have
chosen
to
record
six
days
of
a
long
and
eventful
life
and
as
messire
heleigh
might
have
done
i
say
modestly
with
him
of
old

prince
de

came
to
burgos
before
this
he
had
lodged
for
three
months
in
the
district
of
ponthieu
and
the
object
of
his
southern
journey
was
to
assure
the
tenth
alphonso
then
ruling
in
castile
that
the
latter
sister
ellinor
now
resident
at
entréchat
was
beyond
any
reasonable

the
transcendent
lady
whose
existence
old

had
anticipated

cloudily
when
they
fabled
in
remote
time
concerning
queen
heleine
of
sparta
there
was
a
postscript
to
this
news
the
world
knew
that
the
king
of
leon
and
castile
desired
to
be
king
of
germany
as
well
and
that
at
present
a

between

of

he
had
a
vote
alphonso
had
a
sister
so
that
in
effect
ohé
in
effect
he
made
no
question
that
his
majesty
understood
the
astronomer
twitched
his
beard
and
demanded
if
the
fact
that
ellinor
had
been
a
married
woman
these
ten
years
past
was
not
an
obstacle
to
the
plan
which
his
fair
cousin
had
proposed
here
the

accoutred
and
hauled
out
a
paper
dating
from

of
rome
servant
to
the
servants
of
god
desirous
of
all
health
and
apostolical
blessing
for
his
son

stated
that
a
compact
between
a
boy
of
fifteen
and
a
girl
of
ten
was
an
affair
of
no
particular
moment
and
that
in
consideration
of
the
covenantors
never
having
clapped
eyes
upon
each
other
since
the
even
had

groom
father
and
the
bride
mother
rendered
a
consummation
of
the
childish
oath
an
obvious
and
a
most
heinous
enormity
why
that
in
a
sentence
and
for
all
his
coy
verbosity
the
new
pontiff
was
perfectly
amenable
to
reason
so
in
a
month
it
was
settled
alphonso
would
give
his
sister
to
de
gâtinais
and
in
exchange
get
the
latter
vote
to
make
alphonso
king
of
germany
and
gui
foulques
of
sabionetta
now
clement
fourth
pope
to
assume
that
name

and
in

get

evesham
people
said
of
course
that
such
behavior
was
less
in
the
manner
of
his
nominal
father
king
henry
than
reminiscent
of
count
manuel
of
poictesme
whose
portraits
certainly
the
prince
resembled
to
an
embarrassing
extent
either
way
the
barons
power
was
demolished
there
would
be
no
more
internecine
war
and
spurred
by
the
unaccustomed
idleness
prince
edward
began
to
think
of
the
foreign
girl
he
had
not
seen
since
the
day
he
wedded
her
she
would
be
a
woman
by
this
and
it
was
befitting
that
he
claim
his
wife
he
rode
with
hawise
bulmer
and
her
baby
to
ambresbury
and
at
the
gate
of
the
nunnery
they
parted
with
what
agonies
are
immaterial
to
this
history
progression
the
tale
merely
tells
that
having
thus
decorously
rid
himself
of
his
mistress
the
prince
went
into
lower
picardy
alone
riding
at
adventure
as
he
loved
to
do
and
thus
came
to
entréchat
where
his
wife
resided
with
her
mother
the
countess
johane
in
a
wood
near
the
castle
he
approached
a
company
of
spaniards
four
in
number
their
horses
tethered
while
these
men
oviedans
as
they
told
him
drank
about
a
great
stone
which
served
them
for
a
table
being
thirsty
he
asked
and
was
readily
accorded
hospitality
and
these
five
fell
into
amicable
discourse
one
fellow
asked
his
name
and
business
in
those
parts
and
the
prince
gave
each
without
hesitancy
as
he
reached
for
the
bottle
and
afterward
dropped
it
just
in
time
to
catch
cannily
with
his
naked
left
hand
the
with
which
the
rascal
had
dug
at
the
unguarded
ribs
the
prince
was
astounded
but
he
was
never
a
subtle
man
here
were
four
knaves
who
for
reasons
unexplained
but
to
them
of
undoubted
cogency
desired
his
death
manifestly
there
was
here
an
actionable
difference
of
opinion
so
he
had
his
sword
out
and
killed
the
four
of
them
presently
came
to
him
an
boy
habited
as
a
page
who
riding
jauntily
through
the
forest
lighted
upon
the
prince
now
in
bottomless
vexation
the
lad
drew
rein
and
his
lips
outlined
a
whistle
at
his
feet
were
several
dead
men
in
various
conditions
of
dismemberment
and
seated
among
them
as
if
throned
upon
this
boulder
was
a
gigantic
and
florid
person
so
tall
that
the
heads
of
few
men
reached
to
his
shoulder
a
person
of
handsome
exterior
and
blond
having
a
narrow
small
head
and
vivid
light
blue
eyes
and
the
chest
of
a
stallion
a
person
whose
left
eyebrow
had
an
odd
oblique
droop
so
that
the
stupendous
man
appeared
to
be
winking
the
information
that
he
was
in
jest
fair
friend
said
the
page
god
give
you
joy
and
why
have
you
converted
this
forest
into
a
shambles
the
prince
told
him
as
much
of
the
action
as
has
been
narrated
i
have
perhaps
been
rather
hasty
he
considered
by
way
of
peroration
and
it
vexes
me
that
i
did
not
spare
say
one
of
these
lank
spaniards
if
only
long
enough
to
ascertain
why
in
the
name
of
termagaunt
they
should
have
desired
my
destruction
but
midway
in
his
tale
the
boy
had
dismounted
with
a
gasp
and
he
was
now
inspecting
the
features
of
one
carcass
felons
my
prince
you
have
slain
some
eight
yards
of
felony
which
might
have
cheated
the
gallows
had
they
got
the
princess
ellinor
safe
to
burgos
only
two
days
ago
this
fellow
conveyed
to
her
a
letter
prince
edward
said
you
appear
lad
to
be
somewhat
overheels
in
the
confidence
of
my
wife
now
the
boy
arose
and
defiantly
flung
back
his
head
in
shrill
laughter
your
wife
oh
god
have
mercy
your
wife
and
for
ten
years
left
to
her
own
devices
why
look
you
you
and
your
wife
would
not
know
each
other
were
you
two
brought
face
to
face
prince
edward
said
that
is
very
near
the
truth
but
indeed
it
was
the
absolute
truth
and
as
it
concerned
him
was
already
attested
sire
edward
the
boy
then
said
your
wife
has
wearied
of
this
long
waiting
till
you
chose
to
whistle
for
her
last
summer
the
young
prince
de
gâtinais
came
and
he
is
a
handsome
man
the
page
made
known
all
which
de
gâtinais
and
king
alphonso
planned
the
words
jostling
as
they
came
in
torrents
but
so
that
one
might
understand
i
am
her
page
my
lord
i
was
to
follow
her
these
fellows
were
to
be
my
escort
were
to
ward
off
possible
pursuit
cry
haro
beau
sire
cry
haro
and
shout
it
lustily
for
your
wife
in
company
with
six
other
knaves
is
at
large
between
here
and
burgos
that
unreasonable
wife
who
grew
dissatisfied
after
a
mere
ten
years
of
neglect
i
have
been
remiss
the
prince
said
and
one
huge
hand
strained
at
his
chin
yes
perhaps
i
have
been
remiss
yet
it
had
appeared
to
me
but
as
it
is
i
bid
you
mount
my
lad
the
boy
demanded
and
to
what
end
oy
dieus
messire
have
i
not
slain
your
escort
why
in
common
reason
equity
demands
that
i
afford
you
my
protection
so
far
as
burgos
messire
just
as
plainly
as
equity
demands
i
slay
de
gâtinais
and
fetch
back
my
wife
to
england
the
page
wrung
exquisite
hands
with
a
gesture
which
was
but
partially
tinged
with
anguish
and
presently
began
to
laugh
afterward
these
two
rode
southerly
in
the
direction
of
castile
for
it
appeared
to
the
intriguing
little
woman
a
diverting
jest
that
in
this
fashion
her
husband
should
be
the
promoter
of
her
evasion
it
appeared
to
her
more
diverting
when
in
two
days
space
she
had
become
fond
of
him
she
found
him
rather
slow
of
comprehension
and
she
was
humiliated
by
the
discovery
that
not
an
eyelash
of
the
man
was
irritated
by
his
wife
decampment
he
considered
to
all
appearances
that
some
property
of
his
had
been
stolen
and
he
intended
quite
without
passion
to
repossess
himself
of
it
after
of
course
punishing
the
thief
this
troubled
the
princess
somewhat
and
often
riding
by
her
stolid
husband
side
the
girl
heart
raged
at
memory
of
the
decade
so
newly
overpast
which
had
kept
her
always
dependent
on
the
charity
of
this
or
that
ungracious
patron
on
any
one
who
would
take
charge
of
her
while
the
truant
husband
fought
out
his
endless
squabbles
in
england
slights
enough
she
had
borne
during
the
period
and
squalor
and
physical
hunger
also
she
had
known
who
was
the
child
of
a
king
and
a
saint
but
now
she
rode
toward
the
dear
southland
and
presently
she
would
be
rid
of
this
big
man
when
he
had
served
her
purpose
and
afterward
she
meant
to
wheedle
alphonso
just
as
she
had
always
wheedled
him
and
later
still
she
and
etienne
would
be
very
happy
in
fine
was
to
be
a
new
day
so
these
two
rode
southward
and
always
prince
edward
found
this
new
page
of
his
this
miguel
de
rueda
a
jolly
lad
who
whistled
and
sang
inapposite
snatches
of
balladry
without
any
formal
ending
or
beginning
descanting
always
with
the
delicate
irrelevancy
of
a
sang
miguel
de
rueda
man
love
that
leads
me
day
by
day
through
many
a
screened
and
scented
way
finds
to
assuage
my
thirst
no
love
that
may
the
old
love
slay
none
sweeter
than
the
first
fond
heart
of
mine
that
beats
so
fast
as
this
or
that
fair
maid
trips
past
once
and
with
lesser
stir
we
viewed
the
grace
of
love
at
last
and
turned
idolater
lad
love
it
was
that
in
the
spring
when
all
things
woke
to
blossoming
was
as
a
child
that
came
laughing
and
filled
with
wondering
nor
knowing
his
own
name
and
still
i
would
prefer
to
think
the
big
man
interrupted
heavily
that
sicily
is
not
the
only
allure
i
would
prefer
to
think
my
wife
so
and
yet
as
i
remember
her
she
was
nothing
extraordinary
the
page
a
little
tartly
said
that
people
might
forget
a
deal
within
a
decade
the
prince
continued
his
unriddling
of
the
scheme
hatched
in
castile
when
manfred
is
driven
out
of
sicily
they
will
give
the
throne
to
de
gâtinais
he
intends
to
get
both
a
kingdom
and
a
handsome
wife
by
this
neat
affair
and
in
reason
england
must
support
my
uncle
claim
to
the
german
crown
against
el
sabio
why
my
lad
i
ride
southward
to
prevent
a
war
that
would
devastate
half
europe
you
ride
southward
in
the
attempt
to
rob
a
miserable
woman
of
her
sole
chance
of
happiness
miguel
de
rueda
estimated
that
is
undeniable
if
she
loves
this
thrifty
prince
as
indeed
i
do
not
question
my
wife
does
yet
our
happiness
here
is
a
trivial
matter
whereas
war
is
a
great
disaster
you
have
not
seen
as
i
my
little
miguel
have
often
seen
a
man
viewing
his
with
a
face
of
stupid
wonder
a
bewildered
wretch
in
point
to
die
in
his
lord
quarrel
and
understanding
never
a
word
of
it
or
a
woman
say
a
woman
twisted
and
naked
body
the
breasts
yet
horribly
heaving
in
the
red
ashes
of
some
village
or
the
already
dripping
hoofs
which
will
presently
crush
this
body
well
it
is
to
prevent
many
such
ugly
spectacles
hereabout
that
i
ride
southward
miguel
de
rueda
shuddered
but
she
has
her
right
to
happiness
the
page
stubbornly
said
she
has
only
one
right
the
prince
retorted
because
it
has
pleased
the
emperor
of
heaven
to
appoint
us
twain
to
lofty
stations
to
entrust
to
us
the
five
talents
of
the
parable
whence
is
our
debt
to
him
being
fivefold
so
much
the
greater
than
that
of
common
persons
therefore
the
more
is
it
our
sole
right
being
fivefold
to
serve
god
without
faltering
and
therefore
is
our
happiness
or
our
unhappiness
the
more
an
inconsiderable
matter
for
as
i
have
read
in
the
annals
of
the
romans
he
launched
upon
the
story
of
king
pompey
and
his
daughter
whom
a
certain
duke
regarded
with
impure
and
improper
emotions
my
little
miguel
that
ancient
king
is
our
heavenly
father
that
only
daughter
is
the
rational
soul
of
us
which
is
here
delivered
for
protection
to
five
soldiers
that
is
to
the
five
senses
to
preserve
it
from
the
devil
the
world
and
the
flesh
but
alas
the
soul
desirous
of
gazing
upon
the
gaudy
vapors
of
this
world
you
whine
like
a
canting
friar
the
page
complained
and
i
can
assure
you
that
the
lady
ellinor
was
prompted
rather
than
hindered
by
her
faculties
of
sight
and
hearing
and
so
on
when
she
fell
in
love
with
de
gâtinais
of
you
two
he
is
beyond
any
question
the
handsomer
and
the
more
intelligent
man
and
it
was
god
who
bestowed
on
her
sufficient
wit
to
perceive
the
superiority
of
de
gâtinais
and
what
am
i
to
deduce
from
this
the
prince
reflected
at
last
he
said
i
have
also
read
in
these
same
gestes
how
seneca
mentions
that
in
poisoned
bodies
on
account
of
the
malignancy
and
the
coldness
of
the
poison
no
worm
will
engender
but
if
the
body
be
smitten
by
lightning
in
a
few
days
the
carcass
will
abound
with
vermin
my
little
miguel
both
men
and
women
are
at
birth
empoisoned
by
sin
and
then
they
produce
no
worm
that
is
no
virtue
but
once
they
are
struck
with
lightning
that
is
by
the
grace
of
god
they
are
astonishingly
fruitful
in
good
works
the
page
began
to
laugh
you
are
hopelessly
absurd
my
prince
though
you
will
never
know
it
and
i
hate
you
a
little
and
i
envy
you
a
great
deal
ah
but
prince
edward
said
in
misapprehension
for
the
man
was
never
but
it
is
not
for
my
own
happiness
that
i
ride
southward
the
page
then
said
what
is
her
name
prince
edward
answered
very
fondly
hawise
i
hate
her
too
said
miguel
de
rueda
and
i
think
that
the
holy
angels
alone
know
how
profoundly
i
envy
her
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
they
neared
ruffec
and
at
the
ford
found
three
brigands
ready
two
of
whom
the
prince
slew
and
the
other
fled
next
night
they
supped
at
manneville
and
sat
afterward
in
the
little
square
that
lay
before
their
inn
miguel
had
procured
a
lute
from
the
innkeeper
and
he
strummed
idly
as
these
two
debated
together
of
great
matters
about
them
was
an
immeasurable
twilight
moonless
but
tempered
by
many
stars
and
everywhere
they
could
hear
an
agreeable
whispering
of
leaves
listen
my
prince
the
boy
said
here
is
one
view
of
the
affair
and
he
began
to
chant
without
rhyming
without
raising
his
voice
above
the
pitch
of
talk
while
the
lute
monotonously
accompanied
his
chanting
sang
miguel
passeth
a
little
while
and
irus
the
beggar
and
menephtah
the
high
king
are
at
sorry
unison
and
guenevere
is
a
skull
multitudinously
we
tread
toward
oblivion
as
ants
hasten
toward
sugar
and
presently
time
cometh
with
his
broom
multitudinously
we
tread
a
dusty
road
toward
oblivion
but
yonder
the
sun
shines
upon
a
converting
it
into
an
emerald
and
i
am
aweary
of
the
trodden
path
is
the
fair
peril
that
guards
the
grasses
yonder
and
her
breasts
are
naked
of
vanities
saith
the
beloved
but
she
whom
i
love
seems
very
far
away
though
i
might
be
with
her
if
i
would
and
she
may
not
aid
me
now
for
not
even
love
is
she
is
most
dear
of
created
women
and
very
wise
but
she
may
never
understand
that
at
any
time
one
grows
aweary
of
the
trodden
path
at
sight
of
my
beloved
love
closes
over
my
heart
like
a
flood
for
the
sake
of
my
beloved
i
have
striven
with
a
good
endeavor
to
my
tiny
uttermost
pardie
i
am
not
priam
at
the
head
of
his
army
a
little
while
and
i
will
repent
i
can
not
but
remember
that
there
are
women
whose
lips
are
of
a
livelier
tint
that
life
is
short
at
best
that
wine
evokes
in
me
some
admiration
for
myself
and
that
i
am
aweary
of
the
trodden
path
she
is
very
far
from
me
yonder
in
the
hörselberg
they
exult
and
make
sweet
songs
songs
which
are
sweeter
immeasurably
sweeter
than
this
song
of
mine
but
in
the
trodden
path
i
falter
for
i
am
tired
tired
in
every
fibre
of
me
and
i
am
aweary
of
the
trodden
path
followed
a
silence
ignorance
spoke
there
the
prince
said
it
is
the
song
of
a
woman
or
else
of
a
boy
who
is
very
young
give
me
the
lute
my
little
miguel
and
presently
the
prince
too
sang
sang
the
prince
i
was
in
a
path
and
i
trod
toward
the
citadel
of
the
land
seigneur
and
on
either
side
were
pleasant
and
forbidden
meadows
having
various
names
and
one
trod
with
me
who
babbled
of
the
brooding
mountains
and
of
the
and
adjacent
clouds
of
the
west
wind
and
of
the
budding
he
debated
the
significance
of
these
things
and
he
went
astray
to
gather
violets
while
i
walked
in
the
trodden
path
he
babbled
of
genial
wine
and
of
the
alert
lips
of
women
of
swinging
censers
and
of
the
serene
countenances
of
priests
and
of
the
clear
lovely
colors
of
bread
and
butter
and
his
heart
was
troubled
by
a
world
profuse
in
beauty
and
he
leaped
a
stile
to
share
his
allotted
provision
with
a
dying
dog
and
afterward
being
hungry
a
wall
to
pilfer
apples
while
i
walked
in
the
trodden
path
he
babbled
of
autumn
bankruptcy
and
of
the
lying
promises
of
spring
and
of
his
own
desire
to
be
at
rest
and
of
running
waters
and
of
decaying
leaves
he
babbled
of
the
stars
and
he
debated
whether
they
were
the
eyes
of
god
or
gases
which
burned
and
he
demonstrated
with
logic
that
neither
existed
at
times
he
stumbled
as
he
stared
about
him
and
munched
his
apples
so
that
he
was
all
bemired
but
i
walked
in
the
trodden
path
and
the
path
led
to
the
gateway
of
a
citadel
and
through
the
gateway
us
not
enter
he
said
the
citadel
is
vacant
and
moreover
i
am
in
profound
terror
and
besides
i
have
not
as
yet
eaten
all
my
apples
and
he
wept
aloud
but
i
was
not
afraid
for
i
had
walked
in
the
trodden
path
again
there
was
a
silence
you
paint
a
dreary
world
my
prince
my
little
miguel
i
paint
the
world
as
the
eternal
father
made
it
the
laws
of
the
place
are
written
large
so
that
all
may
read
them
and
we
know
that
every
road
whether
it
be
my
trodden
path
or
some
byway
through
your
gayer
meadows
yet
leads
in
the
end
to
god
we
have
our
choice
or
to
come
to
him
as
a
laborer
comes
at
evening
for
the
day
wages
fairly
earned
or
to
come
as
a
roisterer
haled
before
the
magistrate
i
consider
you
to
be
in
the
right
the
boy
said
after
a
lengthy
interval
although
i
decline
and
decline
emphatically
to
believe
you
the
prince
laughed
there
spoke
youth
he
said
and
he
sighed
as
though
he
were
a
patriarch
but
we
have
sung
we
two
the
eternal
tenson
of
god
will
and
of
man
desires
and
i
claim
the
prize
my
little
miguel
suddenly
the
page
kissed
one
huge
hand
you
have
conquered
my
very
dull
and
very
glorious
prince
concerning
that
hawise
but
miguel
de
rueda
choked
oh
i
do
not
understand
and
yet
in
part
i
understand
the
boy
wailed
in
the
darkness
and
the
prince
laid
one
hand
upon
his
page
hair
and
smiled
in
the
darkness
to
note
how
soft
was
this
hair
since
the
man
was
less
a
fool
than
at
first
view
you
might
have
taken
him
to
be
and
he
said
one
must
play
the
game
out
fairly
my
lad
we
are
no
little
people
she
and
i
the
children
of
many
kings
of
god
regents
here
on
earth
and
it
was
never
reasonable
my
miguel
that
gentlefolk
should
cheat
at
their
dicing
the
same
night
miguel
de
rueda
repeated
the
prayer
which
saint
theophilus
made
long
ago
to
the
mother
of
god
dame
je
flors
et
lis
et
rose
en
qui
li
filz
diex
se
repose
and
so
on
or
in
other
wording
hearken
o
gracious
lady
thou
that
art
more
fair
than
any
flower
of
the
eglantine
more
comely
than
the
blossoming
of
the
rose
or
of
the
lily
thou
to
whom
was
confided
the
very
son
of
god
harken
for
i
am
afraid
afford
counsel
to
me
that
am
ensnared
by
satan
and
know
not
what
to
do
never
will
i
make
an
end
of
praying
o
virgin
débonnaire
o
honored
lady
thou
that
wast
once
a
woman
so
he
prayed
and
upon
the
next
day
as
these
two
rode
southward
he
sang
half
as
if
in
defiance
sang
miguel
and
still
whatever
years
impend
to
witness
time
a
fickle
friend
and
youth
a
dwindling
fire
i
must
adore
till
all
years
end
my
first
love
heart
desire
i
may
not
hear
men
speak
of
her
unmoved
and
vagrant
pulses
stir
to
greet
her
and
i
in
all
her
worshipper
must
serve
her
till
i
die
for
i
remember
this
is
she
that
reigns
in
one
man
memory
immune
to
age
and
fret
and
stays
the
maid
i
may
not
see
nor
win
to
nor
forget
it
was
on
the
following
day
near
bazas
that
these
two
encountered
adam
de
gourdon
a
provençal
knight
with
whom
the
prince
fought
for
a
long
while
without
either
contestant
giving
way
in
consequence
a
rendezvous
was
fixed
for
the
november
of
that
year
and
afterward
the
prince
and
de
gourdon
parted
highly
pleased
with
each
other
thus
the
prince
and
his
attendant
came
in
late
september
to
mauléon
on
the
castilian
frontier
and
dined
there
at
the
three
or
four
lackeys
were
about
some
exalted
person
retinue
prince
edward
hazarded
to
the
swart
little
landlord
as
the
prince
and
miguel
lingered
over
the
remnants
of
their
meal
yes
the
fellow
informed
them
the
prince
de
gâtinais
had
lodged
there
for
a
whole
week
watching
the
north
road
as
circumspect
of
all
passage
as
a
cat
over
a
eh
monseigneur
expected
some
one
doubtless
a
lady
it
might
be
the
gentlefolk
had
their
escapades
like
every
one
else
the
innkeeper
babbled
vaguely
for
on
a
sudden
he
was
very
much
afraid
of
his
gigantic
patron
you
will
show
me
to
his
room
prince
edward
said
with
a
politeness
that
was
ingratiating
the
host
shuddered
and
obeyed
miguel
de
rueda
left
alone
sat
quite
silent
his
drumming
upon
the
table
he
rose
suddenly
and
flung
back
his
shoulders
all
resolution
on
the
stairway
he
passed
the
black
little
landlord
who
was
now
in
a
sad
twitter
foreseeing
bloodshed
but
miguel
de
rueda
went
on
to
the
room
above
the
door
was
ajar
he
paused
there
de
gâtinais
had
risen
from
his
dinner
and
stood
facing
the
door
he
too
was
a
blond
man
and
the
comeliest
of
his
day
and
at
sight
of
him
awoke
in
the
woman
heart
all
the
old
tenderness
handsome
and
brave
and
witty
she
knew
him
to
be
as
indeed
the
whole
world
knew
him
to
be
distinguished
by
every
namable
grace
and
the
innate
weakness
of
de
gâtinais
which
she
alone
suspected
made
him
now
seem
doubly
dear
fiercely
she
wanted
to
shield
him
less
from
bodily
hurt
than
from
that
which
she
cloudily
apprehended
to
be
at
hand
the
test
was
come
and
etienne
would
fail
thus
much
she
knew
with
a
sick
illimitable
surety
and
she
loved
de
gâtinais
with
a
passion
which
dwarfed
comprehension
o
madame
the
virgin
prayed
miguel
de
rueda
thou
that
wast
once
a
woman
even
as
i
am
now
a
woman
grant
that
the
man
may
slay
him
quickly
grant
that
he
may
slay
etienne
very
quickly
honored
lady
so
that
my
etienne
may
die
unshamed
i
must
question
messire
de
gâtinais
was
saying
whether
you
have
been
well
inspired
yes
quite
frankly
i
do
await
the
arrival
of
her
who
is
your
nominal
wife
and
your
intervention
at
this
late
stage
i
take
it
can
have
no
outcome
save
to
render
you
absurd
so
come
now
be
advised
by
me
messire
prince
edward
said
i
am
not
here
to
talk
for
messire
i
grant
you
that
in
ordinary
disputation
the
cutting
of
one
gentleman
throat
by
another
gentleman
is
well
enough
since
the
argument
is
unanswerable
yet
in
this
case
we
have
each
of
us
too
much
to
live
for
you
to
govern
your
reconquered
england
and
i
you
perceive
that
i
am
candid
to
achieve
in
turn
the
kingship
of
another
realm
now
to
secure
this
realm
possession
of
the
lady
ellinor
is
to
me
essential
to
you
she
is
nothing
she
is
a
woman
whom
i
have
deeply
wronged
prince
edward
said
and
to
whom
god
willing
i
mean
to
make
atonement
ten
years
ago
they
wedded
us
to
avert
the
impending
war
between
spain
and
england
el
sabio
intends
to
purchase
germany
with
her
body
as
the
price
you
to
get
sicily
as
her
husband
mort
de
dieu
is
a
woman
thus
to
be
bought
and
sold
like
hog
flesh
we
have
other
and
cleaner
customs
we
of
england
eh
and
who
purchased
the
woman
first
de
gâtinais
spat
at
him
viciously
for
the
frenchman
now
saw
his
shaken
to
the
they
wedded
me
to
the
child
in
order
that
a
great
war
might
be
averted
i
acquiesced
since
it
appeared
preferable
that
two
people
suffer
inconvenience
rather
than
many
thousands
be
slain
and
still
this
is
my
view
of
the
matter
yet
afterward
i
failed
her
love
had
no
clause
in
our
agreement
but
i
owed
her
more
protection
than
i
have
afforded
england
has
long
been
no
place
for
women
i
thought
she
would
comprehend
that
much
but
i
know
very
little
of
women
battle
and
death
are
more
wholesome
companions
i
now
perceive
than
such
folk
as
you
and
alphonso
woman
is
the
weaker
vessel
the
negligence
was
mine
i
may
not
blame
her
the
big
and
simple
man
was
in
an
agony
of
repentance
on
a
sudden
he
strode
forward
his
sword
now
shifted
to
his
left
hand
and
his
right
hand
outstretched
one
and
all
we
are
weaklings
in
the
net
of
circumstance
shall
one
herring
then
blame
his
fellow
if
his
fellow
jostle
him
we
walk
as
in
a
mist
of
error
and
belial
is
fertile
in
allurements
yet
always
it
is
granted
us
to
behold
that
sin
is
sin
i
have
perhaps
sinned
through
anger
messire
de
gâtinais
more
deeply
than
you
have
planned
to
sin
through
luxury
and
through
ambition
let
us
then
cry
quits
messire
de
gâtinais
and
afterward
part
in
peace
and
in
common
repentance
and
yield
you
ellinor
de
gâtinais
said
oh
no
messire
i
reply
to
you
with
arnaud
de
marveil
that
marvellous
singer
of
eld
may
bear
her
from
my
presence
but
they
can
never
untie
the
knot
which
unites
my
heart
to
her
for
that
heart
so
tender
and
so
constant
god
alone
divides
with
my
lady
and
the
portion
which
god
possesses
he
holds
but
as
a
part
of
her
domain
and
as
her
vassal
this
is
blasphemy
prince
edward
now
retorted
and
for
such
observations
alone
you
merit
death
will
you
always
talk
and
talk
and
talk
i
perceive
that
the
devil
is
far
more
subtle
than
you
messire
and
leads
you
like
a
pig
with
a
ring
in
his
nose
toward
gross
iniquity
messire
i
tell
you
that
for
your
soul
health
i
doubly
mean
to
kill
you
now
so
let
us
make
an
end
of
this
de
gâtinais
turned
and
took
up
his
sword
since
you
will
have
it
he
rather
regretfully
said
yet
i
reiterate
that
you
play
an
absurd
part
your
wife
has
deserted
you
has
fled
in
abhorrence
of
you
for
three
weeks
she
has
been
tramping
god
knows
whither
or
in
what
company
he
was
here
interrupted
what
the
lady
ellinor
has
done
prince
edward
crisply
said
was
at
my
request
we
were
wedded
at
burgos
it
was
natural
that
we
should
desire
our
reunion
to
take
place
at
burgos
and
she
came
to
burgos
with
an
escort
which
i
provided
de
gâtinais
sneered
so
that
is
the
tale
you
will
deliver
to
the
world
after
i
have
slain
you
the
prince
said
yes
the
reservation
is
wise
for
if
i
were
dead
messire
edward
there
would
be
none
to
know
that
you
risk
all
for
a
drained
goblet
for
an
orange
already
squeezed
quite
dry
messire
face
of
god
the
prince
said
but
de
gâtinais
flung
back
both
arms
in
a
great
gesture
so
that
he
knocked
a
flask
of
claret
from
the
table
at
his
rear
i
am
candid
my
prince
i
would
not
see
any
brave
gentleman
slain
in
a
cause
so
foolish
in
consequence
i
kiss
and
tell
in
effect
i
was
eloquent
i
was
magnificent
so
that
in
the
end
her
reserve
was
shattered
like
the
wooden
flask
yonder
at
our
feet
is
it
worth
while
think
you
that
our
blood
flow
like
this
flagon
contents
liar
prince
edward
said
very
softly
o
hideous
liar
already
your
eyes
shift
he
drew
near
and
struck
the
frenchman
talk
and
talk
and
talk
and
lying
talk
i
am
ashamed
while
i
share
the
world
with
a
thing
as
base
as
you
de
gâtinais
hurled
upon
him
cursing
sobbing
in
an
abandoned
fury
in
an
instant
the
place
resounded
like
a
smithy
for
there
were
no
better
swordsmen
living
than
these
two
the
eavesdropper
could
see
nothing
clearly
round
and
round
they
veered
in
a
whirl
of
turmoil
presently
prince
edward
trod
upon
the
broken
flask
smashing
it
his
foot
slipped
in
the
spilth
of
wine
and
the
huge
body
went
down
like
an
oak
his
head
striking
one
leg
of
the
table
a
candle
de
gâtinais
cried
and
he
panted
now
a
hundred
candles
to
the
virgin
of
beaujolais
he
shortened
his
sword
to
stab
the
prince
of
england
the
eavesdropper
came
through
the
doorway
and
flung
herself
between
prince
edward
and
the
descending
sword
the
sword
dug
deep
into
her
shoulder
so
that
she
shrieked
once
with
the
cold
pain
of
this
wound
then
she
rose
ashen
liar
she
said
oh
i
am
shamed
while
i
share
the
world
with
a
thing
as
base
as
you
in
silence
de
gâtinais
regarded
her
there
was
a
long
interval
before
he
said
ellinor
and
then
again
ellinor
like
a
man
bewildered
was
eloquent
i
was
she
said
that
in
the
end
her
reserve
was
shattered
certainly
messire
it
is
not
your
death
which
i
desire
since
a
man
dies
so
very
very
quickly
i
desire
for
you
i
know
not
what
i
desire
for
you
the
girl
wailed
you
desire
that
i
should
endure
this
present
moment
de
gâtinais
replied
for
as
god
reigns
i
love
you
of
whom
i
have
spoken
infamy
and
my
shame
is
very
bitter
she
said
and
i
too
loved
you
it
is
strange
to
think
of
that
i
was
afraid
never
in
my
life
have
i
been
afraid
before
but
i
was
afraid
of
this
terrible
and
fair
and
righteous
man
i
saw
all
hope
of
you
vanish
all
hope
of
sicily
in
effect
i
lied
as
a
cornered
beast
spits
out
his
venom
i
know
she
answered
give
me
water
etienne
she
washed
and
bound
the
prince
head
with
a
napkin
ellinor
sat
upon
the
floor
the
big
man
head
upon
her
knee
he
will
not
die
of
this
for
he
is
of
strong
person
look
you
messire
de
gâtinais
you
and
i
are
not
strong
we
are
so
fashioned
that
we
can
enjoy
only
the
pleasant
things
of
life
but
this
man
can
enjoy
enjoy
mark
you
the
commission
of
any
act
however
distasteful
if
he
think
it
to
be
his
duty
there
is
the
difference
i
can
not
fathom
him
but
it
is
now
necessary
that
i
become
all
which
he
loves
since
he
loves
it
and
that
i
be
in
thought
and
deed
all
which
he
desires
for
i
have
heard
the
tenson
through
you
love
him
said
de
gâtinais
she
glanced
upward
with
a
pitiable
smile
no
it
is
you
whom
i
love
my
etienne
you
can
not
understand
how
at
this
very
moment
every
fibre
of
me
heart
soul
and
body
may
be
longing
just
to
comfort
you
and
to
give
you
all
which
you
desire
my
etienne
and
to
make
you
happy
my
handsome
etienne
at
however
dear
a
cost
no
you
will
never
understand
that
and
since
you
may
not
understand
i
merely
bid
you
go
and
leave
me
with
my
husband
and
then
there
fell
between
these
two
an
infinite
silence
listen
de
gâtinais
said
grant
me
some
little
credit
for
what
i
do
you
are
alone
the
man
is
powerless
my
fellows
are
within
call
a
word
secures
the
prince
death
a
word
gets
me
you
and
sicily
and
i
do
not
speak
that
word
for
you
are
my
lady
as
well
as
his
and
your
will
is
my
one
law
but
there
was
no
mercy
in
the
girl
no
more
for
him
than
for
herself
the
big
head
lay
upon
her
breast
she
caressed
the
gross
hair
of
it
ever
so
lightly
these
are
tinsel
oaths
she
crooned
as
if
rapt
with
incurious
content
these
are
the
old
empty
protestations
of
all
you
strutting
poets
a
word
gets
you
what
you
desire
then
why
do
you
not
speak
that
word
why
do
you
not
speak
many
words
and
become
again
as
eloquent
and
as
magnificent
as
you
were
when
you
contrived
that
adultery
about
which
you
were
just

he
said
and
then
he
said
it
is
just
he
left
the
room
and
presently
rode
away
with
his
men
i
say
that
here
at
last
he
had
done
a
knightly
deed
but
she
thought
little
of
it
never
raised
her
head
as
the
troop
clattered
from
mauléon
with
a
lessening
beat
which
lapsed
now
into
the
blunders
of
an
aging
fly
who
doddered
about
the
window
yonder
she
stayed
thus
motionless
her
meditations
adrift
in
the
future
and
that
which
she
foreread
left
her
not
all
sorry
nor
profoundly
glad
for
living

by
this

scarcely
the
merry
and
colorful

thus
nicolas

came
letters
to
the
first
king
edward
of
england
from
his
kinsman
and
ambassador
to
france
earl
edmund
of
lancaster
it
was
perfectly
apparent
the
earl
wrote
that
the
french
king
meant
to
surrender
to
the
earl
lord
and
brother
neither
the
duchy
of
guienne
nor
the
lady
blanch
this
lady
i
must
tell
you
was
now
affianced
to
king
edward
whose
first
wife
dame
ellinor
had
died
eight
years
before
this
time
the
courier
found
sire
edward
at
ipswich
midway
in
celebration
of
his
daughter
marriage
to
the
count
of
holland
the
king
read
the
letters
through
and
began
to
laugh
and
presently
broke
into
a
rage
such
as
was
possible
men
whispered
only
to
the
blood
of
descendants
next
day
the
keeper
of
the
privy
purse
entered
upon
the
a
considerable
sum
to
make
good
a
large
ruby
and
an
emerald
lost
out
of
his
coronet
when
the
king
grace
was
pleased
to
throw
it
into
the
fire
and
upon
the
same
day
the
king
recalled
lancaster
the
king
then
despatched
yet
another
embassy
into
france
to
treat
about
sire
edward
marriage
this
last
embassy
was
headed
by
the
earl
of
aquitaine
his
lieutenant
was
lord
pevensey
the
king
natural
son
by
hawise
bulmer
the
earl
got
audience
of
the
french
king
at
mezelais
walking
alone
came
this
earl
of
aquitaine
with
a
large
retinue
into
the
hall
where
the
barons
of
france
stood
according
to
their
rank
in
unadorned
russet
were
the
big
earl
and
his
attendants
but
upon
the
scarlets
and
purples
of
the
french
lords
many
jewels
shone
it
was
as
though
through
a
corridor
of
gayly
painted
sunlit
glass
that
the
grave
earl
came
to
the
dais
where
sat
king
philippe
the
king
had
risen
at
close
sight
of
the
new
envoy
and
had
gulped
once
or
twice
and
without
speaking
had
hurriedly
waved
his
lords
out
of
the
king
perturbation
was
very
extraordinary
fair
cousin
the
earl
now
said
without
any
prelude
four
years
ago
i
was
affianced
to
your
sister
dame
blanch
you
stipulated
that
gascony
be
given
up
to
you
in
guaranty
as
a
settlement
on
any
children
i
might
have
by
that
incomparable
lady
i
assented
and
yielded
you
the
province
upon
the
understanding
sworn
to
according
to
the
faith
of
loyal
kings
that
within
forty
days
you
assign
to
me
its
seignory
as
your
vassal
and
i
have
had
of
you
since
then
neither
my
province
nor
my
betrothed
wife
but
only
excuses
sire
philippe
with
eloquence
the
frenchman
touched
upon
the
emergencies
to
which
the
public
weal
so
often
drives
men
of
high
station
and
upon
his
private
grief
over
the
necessity
unavoidable
alas
of
returning
a
hard
answer
before
the
council
and
became
so
voluble
that
sire
edward
merely
laughed
in
that
and
disconcerting
way
of
his
and
afterward
lodged
for
a
week
at
mezelais
nominally
passing
by
his
minor
title
of
earl
of
aquitaine
and
as
his
own
ambassador
negotiations
became
more
swift
of
foot
since
a
man
serves
himself
with
zeal
in
addition
the
french
lords
could
make
nothing
of
a
politician
so
that
he
replied
to
every
consideration
of
expediency
with
a
reiteration
of
the
circumstance
that
already
the
bargain
was
signed
and
sworn
to
in
consequence
while
daily
they
fumed
over
his
stupidity
daily
he
gained
his
point
during
this
period
he
was
upon
one
pretext
or
another
very
often
in
the
company
of
his
affianced
wife
dame
blanch
this
lady
i
must
tell
you
was
the
handsomest
of
her
day
there
could
nowhere
be
found
a
creature
more
agreeable
to
every
sense
and
she
compelled
the
adoring
regard
of
men
it
is
recorded
not
gently
but
in
an
imperious
fashion
sire
edward
who
till
this
had
loved
her
merely
by
report
and
in
accordance
with
the
high
custom
of
old
through
many
perusals
of
her
portrait
now
appeared
besotted
he
was
an
aging
man
near
sixty
huge
and
fair
with
a
crisp
beard
and
the
bright
unequal
eyes
of
manuel
of
poictesme
the
at
mezelais
began
to
liken
this
so
candidly
enamored
monarch
and
his
princess
to
sieur
hercules
at
the
feet
of
queen
omphale
the
court
hunted
and
slew
a
stag
of
ten
in
the
woods
of
ermenoueïl
which
stand
thick
about
the
château
and
at
the
hunt
end
these
two
had
dined
at
rigon
the
forester
hut
in
company
with
dame
meregrett
the
french
king
younger
sister
she
sat
a
little
apart
from
the
betrothed
and
stared
through
the
hut
one
window
we
know
nowadays
it
was
not
merely
the
trees
she
was
considering
dame
blanch
seemed
undisposed
to
mirth
we
have
slain
the
stag
beau
sire
she
said
and
have
made
of
his
death
a
brave
diversion
we
have
had
our
sport
of
death
and
presently
the
gay
years
wind
past
us
as
our
cavalcade
came
toward
the
stag
and
god
incurious
angel
slays
us
much
as
we
slew
the
stag
and
we
shall
not
understand
and
we
shall
wonder
as
the
stag
did
in
helpless
wonder
and
death
will
have
his
sport
of
us
as
if
in
atonement
her
big
eyes
shone
as
when
the
sun
glints
upon
a
pool
ohé
i
have
known
such
happiness
of
late
beau
sire
that
i
am
hideously
afraid
to
die
the
king
answered
i
too
have
been
very
happy
of
late
but
it
is
profitless
to
talk
about
death
thus
drearily
let
us
flout
him
instead
with
some
gay
song
and
thereupon
she
handed
sire
edward
a
lute
the
king
accepted
it
death
is
not
reasonably
mocked
by
any
person
sire
edward
said
since
in
the
end
he
conquers
and
of
the
lips
that
gibed
at
him
remains
but
a
little
dust
rather
should
i
who
already
stand
beneath
a
lifted
sword
make
for
my
destined
and
inescapable
conqueror
a
sirvente
which
is
the
song
of
service
sang
sire
edward
i
sing
of
death
that
comes
unto
the
king
and
lightly
plucks
him
from
the
cushioned
throne
and
drowns
his
glory
and
his
warfaring
in
unrecorded
dim
oblivion
and
girds
another
with
the
sword
thereof
and
sets
another
in
his
stead
to
reign
and
ousts
the
remnant
nakedly
to
gain
styx
formless
shore
and
nakedly
complain
midst
twittering
ghosts
lamenting
life
and
love
for
death
is
merciless
a
king
he
raises
in
the
place
of
prester
john
smites
priam
and
in
conquering
bids
caesar
pause
the
wit
of
salomon
the
wealth
of
nero
and
the
pride
thereof
and
or
of
tamburlaine
darius
jeshua
or
charlemaigne
wheedle
and
bribe
and
surfeit
death
in
vain
and
get
no
grace
of
him
nor
any
love
incuriously
he
smites
the
armored
king
and
tricks
his
counsellors
true
o
god
murmured
the
tiny
woman
who
sat
beside
the
window
yonder
with
that
dame
meregrett
rose
and
passed
from
the
room
the
two
lovers
started
and
laughed
and
afterward
paid
little
heed
to
her
outgoing
sire
edward
had
put
aside
the
lute
and
sat
now
regarding
the
princess
his
big
left
hand
propped
the
bearded
chin
his
grave
countenance
was
flushed
and
his
intent
eyes
shone
under
their
shaggy
brows
very
steadily
although
the
left
eye
was
now
so
nearly
shut
as
to
reveal
the
merest
spark
irresolutely
dame
blanch
plucked
at
her
gown
then
rearranged
a
fold
of
it
and
with
composure
awaited
the
ensuing
action
afraid
at
bottom
but
not
at
all
and
she
looked
downward
the
king
said
never
before
were
we
two
alone
madame
fate
is
very
gracious
to
me
this
morning
fate
the
lady
considered
has
never
denied
much
to
the
hammer
of
the
scots
she
has
denied
me
nothing
he
sadly
said
save
the
one
thing
that
makes
this
business
of
living
seem
a
rational
proceeding
fame
and
power
and
wealth
fate
has
accorded
me
no
doubt
but
never
the
common
joys
of
life
and
look
you
my
princess
i
am
of
aging
person
now
during
some
thirty
years
i
have
ruled
england
according
to
my
interpretation
of
god
will
as
it
was
anciently
made
manifest
by
the
holy
evangelists
and
during
that
period
i
have
ruled
england
not
without
odd
of
commendation
yet
behold
i
forget
the
excellent
king
edward
and
remember
only
edward
plantagenet
and
desirous
man
of
whom
that
king
has
made
a
prisoner
all
these
years
it
is
the
duty
of
exalted
persons
blanch
unsteadily
said
to
put
aside
such
private
inclinations
as
their
breasts
may
harbor
he
said
i
have
done
what
i
might
for
the
happiness
of
every
englishman
within
my
realm
saving
only
edward
plantagenet
and
now
i
think
his
turn
to
be
at
hand
then
the
man
kept
silence
and
his
hot
appraisal
daunted
her
lord
she
presently
faltered
lord
you
know
that
we
are
already
betrothed
and
in
sober
verity
love
can
not
extend
his
laws
between
husband
and
wife
since
the
gifts
of
love
are
voluntary
and
husband
and
wife
are
but
the
slaves
of
duty
troubadourish
nonsense
sire
edward
said
yet
it
is
true
that
the
gifts
of
love
are
voluntary
and
therefore
ha
most
beautiful
what
have
you
and
i
to
do
with
all
this
chaffering
over
guienne
the
two
stood
very
close
to
each
other
now
blanch
said
it
is
a
high
matter
then
on
a
sudden
the
girl
was
aglow
it
is
a
trivial
matter
he
took
her
in
his
arms
since
already
her
cheeks
flared
in
scarlet
anticipation
of
the
event
thus
holding
her
he
wooed
the
girl
tempestuously
here
indeed
was
sieur
hercules
enslaved
burned
by
a
fiercer
fire
than
that
of
nessus
and
the
huge
bulk
of
the
unconquerable
visibly
shaken
by
his
adoration
in
a
disordered
tapestry
of
verbiage
aflap
in
winds
of
passion
she
presently
beheld
herself
prefigured
by
balkis
the
judean
lure
and
by
that
princess
of
cyprus
who
reigned
in
aristotle
time
and
by
nicolete
the
king
daughter
of
carthage
since
the
first
flush
of
morning
was
as
a
before
her
resplendency
the
man
swore
and
in
conclusion
he
likened
her
to
a
modern
countess
of
tripolis
for
love
of
whom
he
like
rudel
had
cleft
the
seas
and
losing
whom
he
must
inevitably
die
as
did
rudel
sire
edward
snapped
his
fingers
now
over
any
consideration
of
guienne
he
would
conquer
for
her
all
muscovy
and
all
cataia
too
if
she
desired
mere
acreage
meanwhile
he
wanted
her
and
his
hard
and
savage
passion
beat
down
opposition
as
if
with
a
bludgeon
heart
emperor
the
trembling
girl
replied
i
think
that
you
were
cast
in
some
larger
mould
than
we
of
france
oh
none
of
us
may
dare
resist
you
and
i
know
that
nothing
matters
nothing
in
all
the
world
save
that
you
love
me
then
take
me
since
you
will
it
and
take
me
not
as
king
since
you
will
otherwise
but
as
edward
plantagenet
for
listen
by
good
luck
you
have
this
afternoon
despatched
rigon
for
chevrieul
where
we
were
to
hunt
the
great
boar
so
this
hut
will
be
unoccupied
the
man
was
silent
he
had
a
gift
that
way
when
occasion
served
here
then
beau
sire
here
then
at
nine
you
are
to
meet
me
with
my
chaplain
behold
he
marries
us
as
glibly
as
though
we
two
were
peasants
poor
king
and
princess
cried
dame
blanch
and
in
a
voice
which
thrilled
him
shall
ye
not
then
dare
to
be
but
man
and
woman
ha
the
king
said
so
the
chaplain
makes
a
third
well
the
king
is
pleased
to
loose
his
prisoner
that
edward
plantagenet
and
i
will
do
it
so
he
came
that
night
without
any
retinue
and
habited
as
a
forester
with
a
horn
swung
about
his
neck
into
the
unlighted
hut
of
rigon
the
forester
and
he
found
a
woman
there
though
not
the
woman
whom
he
had
expected
treachery
beau
sire
horrible
treachery
she
wailed
i
have
encountered
it
before
this
the
big
man
said
presently
will
come
to
you
not
blanch
but
philippe
with
many
men
to
back
him
and
presently
they
will
slay
you
you
have
been
trapped
beau
sire
ah
for
the
love
of
god
go
go
while
there
is
yet
time
sire
edward
reflected
undoubtedly
to
light
on
edward
longshanks
alone
in
a
forest
would
appear
to
king
philippe
if
properly
attended
a
tempting
chance
to
settle
divers
difficulties
once
for
all
and
sire
edward
knew
the
conscience
of
his
old
opponent
to
be
invulnerable
the
act
would
violate
the
core
of
hospitality
and
knighthood
no
doubt
but
its
outcome
would
be
a
very
definite
gain
to
france
and
for
the
rest
merely
a
dead
body
in
a
ditch
not
a
monarch
in
christendom
sire
edward
reflected
but
feared
and
in
consequence
hated
the
hammer
of
the
scots
and
in
further
consequence
would
not
lift
a
finger
to
avenge
him
and
not
a
being
in
the
universe
would
rejoice
more
heartily
at
the
success
of
philippe
treachery
than
would
sire
edward
son
and
immediate
successor
the
young
prince
edward
of
caernarvon
taking
matters
by
and
large
philippe
had
all
the
powers
of
to
back
him
in
contriving
an
assassination
what
sire
edward
said
was
dame
blanch
then
knew
of
this
but
meregrett
pitiful
eyes
had
already
answered
him
and
he
laughed
a
little
in
that
event
i
have
enregistered
my
name
among
the
goodly
company
of
love
lunatics
as
yokefellow
with
dan
merlin
in
his
thornbush
and
with
wise
salomon
when
he
capered
upon
the
high
places
of
chemosh
and
with
duke
ares
sheepishly
agrin
in
the
net
of
mulciber
rogues
all
madame
fools
all
yet
always
the
flesh
trammels
us
and
allures
the
soul
to
such
sensual
delights
as
bar
its
passage
toward
the
eternal
life
wherein
alone
lies
the
empire
and
the
heritage
of
the
soul
and
why
does
this
carnal
prison
so
impede
the
soul
because
satan
once
ranked
among
the
sons
of
god
and
the
eternal
father
as
i
take
it
has
not
yet
forgotten
the
antique
relationship
and
hence
it
is
permitted
even
in
our
late
time
that
always
the
flesh
rebel
against
the
spirit
and
that
always
these
so
tiny
and
so
tricksters
these
highly
tinted
miracles
of
iniquity
so
gracious
in
demeanor
and
so
then
he
turned
and
pointed
no
longer
the
orotund
zealot
but
the
expectant
captain
now
look
my
princess
in
the
pathway
from
which
he
had
recently
emerged
stood
a
man
in
full
armor
like
a
sentinel
mort
de
dieu
we
can
but
try
to
get
out
of
this
sire
edward
said
you
should
have
tried
without
talking
so
much
replied
meregrett
she
followed
him
and
presently
in
a
big
splash
of
moonlight
the
armed
man
falchion
glittered
across
their
way
back
he
bade
them
for
by
the
king
orders
i
can
let
no
man
pass
it
would
be
very
easy
now
to
strangle
this
herring
sire
edward
reflected
but
it
is
not
easy
to
strangle
a
whole
school
of
herring
the
fellow
retorted
hoh
messire
the
bushes
of
ermenoueîl
are
alive
with
my
associates
the
hut
yonder
in
effect
is
girdled
by
them
and
we
have
our
orders
to
let
no
man
pass
have
you
any
orders
concerning
women
the
king
said
the
man
deliberated
sire
edward
handed
him
three
gold
pieces
there
was
assuredly
no
specific
mention
of
petticoats
the
soldier
now
recollected
and
in
consequence
i
dare
to
pass
the
princess
against
whom
certainly
nothing
can
be
planned
why
in
that
event
sire
edward
said
we
two
had
as
well
bid
each
other
adieu
but
meregrett
only
said
you
bid
me
go
he
waved
his
hand
since
there
is
no
choice
for
that
which
you
have
done
however
tardily
i
thank
you
meantime
i
return
to
rigon
hut
to
rearrange
my
toga
as
king
caesar
did
when
the
assassins
fell
upon
him
and
to
encounter
with
due
decorum
whatever
dame
luck
may
prefer
she
said
you
go
to
your
death
he
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
in
the
end
we
necessarily
die
dame
meregrett
turned
and
without
faltering
passed
back
into
the
hut
when
he
had
lighted
the
inefficient
lamp
which
he
found
there
sire
edward
wheeled
upon
her
in
vexation
presently
come
your
brother
and
his
tattling
lords
to
be
discovered
here
with
me
at
night
alone
means
trouble
for
you
if
philippe
chances
to
fall
into
one
of
his
capetian
rages
it
means
death
she
answered
as
though
she
were
thinking
about
other
matters
yes
now
for
the
first
time
sire
edward
regarded
her
with
profound
consideration
to
the
this
lady
showed
a
descendant
of
the
holy
lewis
whom
he
had
known
and
loved
in
old
years
small
and
thinnish
she
was
with
soft
and
profuse
hair
that
for
all
its
blackness
gleamed
in
the
lamplight
with
stray
ripples
of
brilliancy
as
you
may
see
sparks
shudder
to
extinction
over
burning
charcoal
she
had
the
valois
nose
long
and
delicate
in
form
and
overhanging
a
short
yet
the
lips
were
glorious
in
tint
and
the
whiteness
of
her
skin
would
have
matched
the
hyperborean
snows
tidily
enough
as
for
her
eyes
the
customary
similes
of
the
court
poets
were
gigantic
onyxes
or
ebony
highly
polished
and
wet
with
may
dew
these
eyes
were
too
big
for
her
little
face
they
made
of
her
a
tiny
and
desirous
wraith
which
nervously
endured
each
incident
of
life
like
a
foreigner
uneasily
acquiescent
to
the
custom
of
the
country
sire
edward
moved
one
step
toward
this
tiny
lady
and
paused
madame
i
do
not
understand
dame
meregrett
looked
up
into
his
face
unflinchingly
it
means
that
i
love
you
sire
i
may
speak
without
shame
now
for
presently
you
die
die
bravely
sire
die
in
such
fashion
as
may
hearten
me
to
live
the
little
princess
spoke
the
truth
for
always
since
his
coming
to
mezelais
she
had
viewed
the
great
conqueror
as
through
an
aweful
haze
of
forerunning
rumor
twin
to
that
golden
vapor
which
enswathes
a
god
and
transmutes
whatever
in
corporeal
man
would
have
been
a
defect
into
some
divine
and
hitherto
excellence
i
must
tell
you
in
this
place
since
no
other
occasion
offers
that
even
until
the
end
of
her
life
it
was
so
for
to
her
what
in
other
persons
would
have
seemed
flagrant
dulness
showed
somehow
in
sire
edward
as
the
majestic
deliberation
of
one
that
knows
his
verdict
to
be
decisive
and
therefore
appraises
cautiously
and
if
sometimes
his
big
irregular
calm
eyes
betrayed
no
apprehension
of
the
jest
at
which
her
lips
were
laughing
and
of
which
her
brain
approved
always
within
the
instant
her
heart
convinced
her
that
a
god
is
not
lightly
moved
to
mirth
and
now
it
was
a
god
deus
certè
who
had
taken
a
woman
paltry
face
between
his
hands
half
roughly
and
the
maid
is
a
capet
sire
edward
mused
blanch
has
never
desired
you
any
ill
beau
sire
but
she
loves
the
archduke
of
austria
and
once
you
were
dead
she
might
marry
him
one
can
not
blame
her
meregrett
considered
since
he
wishes
to
marry
her
and
she
of
course
wishes
to
make
him
happy
and
not
herself
save
in
some
secondary
way
the
big
king
said
in
part
i
comprehend
madame
now
i
too
hanker
after
this
same
happiness
and
my
admiration
for
the
cantankerous
despoiler
whom
i
praised
this
morning
is
somewhat
abated
there
was
a
tenson
once
lord
lord
how
long
ago
i
learn
too
late
that
truth
may
possibly
have
been
upon
the
losing
side
thus
talking
incoherencies
he
took
up
rigon
lute
sang
sire
edward
incuriously
he
smites
the
armored
king
and
tricks
his
counsellors
yes
the
jingle
ran
thus
now
listen
madame
listen
the
while
that
i
have
my
singing
out
whatever
any
little
may
be
planning
in
corners
sang
sire
edward
as
later
on
death
will
still
our
pleasuring
and
change
for
fevered
laughter
in
the
sun
sleep
such
as
merlin
and
excess
thereof
whence
we
divorceless
death
our
viviaine
implacable
may
never
more
regain
the
unforgotten
rapture
and
the
pain
and
grief
and
ecstasy
of
life
and
love
for
presently
as
quiet
as
the
king
sleeps
now
that
planned
the
keeps
of
ilion
we
too
will
sleep
whilst
overhead
the
spring
rules
and
young
lovers
laugh
as
we
have
done
and
kiss
as
we
that
take
no
heed
thereof
but
slumber
very
soundly
and
disdain
the
heralding
of
winter
wane
and
swift
sweet
ripple
of
the
april
rain
running
about
the
world
to
waken
love
we
shall
have
done
with
love
and
death
be
king
and
turn
our
nimble
bodies
carrion
our
red
lips
dusty
yet
our
live
lips
cling
despite
that
severance
and
are
one
despite
the
grave
and
the
vain
grief
thereof
which
we
will
baffle
if
in
death
domain
fond
memories
may
enter
and
we
twain
may
dream
a
little
and
rehearse
again
in
that
unending
sleep
our
present
love
speed
forth
to
her
in
halting
unison
my
rhymes
and
say
no
hindrance
may
restrain
love
from
his
aim
when
love
is
bent
thereon
and
that
were
love
at
my
disposal
lain
all
mine
to
take
and
death
had
said
lest
i
even
i
exact
the
cost
thereof
i
know
that
even
as
the
follows
the
wind
so
would
i
follow
love
sire
edward
put
aside
the
lute
thus
ends
the
song
of
service
he
said
which
was
made
not
by
the
king
of
england
but
by
edward
plantagenet
and
desirous
man
in
honor
of
the
one
woman
who
within
more
years
than
i
care
to
think
of
has
at
all
considered
edward
plantagenet
i
do
not
comprehend
she
said
and
indeed
she
dared
not
but
now
he
held
both
tiny
hands
in
his
at
best
your
poet
is
an
egotist
i
must
die
presently
meantime
i
crave
largesse
madame
and
a
great
almsgiving
so
that
in
his
unending
sleep
your
poet
may
rehearse
our
present
love
and
even
in
rigon
dim
light
he
found
her
kindling
eyes
not
niggardly
sire
edward
strode
to
the
window
and
raised
big
hands
toward
the
of
the
aloof
stars
master
of
us
all
he
cried
o
father
of
us
all
the
hammer
of
the
scots
am
i
the
scourge
of
france
the
conqueror
of
llewellyn
and
of
leicester
and
the
flail
of
the
accursed
race
that
slew
thine
only
son
the
king
of
england
am
i
who
have
made
of
england
an
imperial
nation
and
have
given
to
thy
englishmen
new
laws
and
i
crave
my
hire
never
o
my
father
have
i
had
of
any
person
aught
save
reverence
or
hatred
never
in
my
life
has
any
person
loved
me
and
i
am
old
my
father
i
am
old
and
presently
i
die
as
i
have
served
thee
as
jacob
wrestled
with
thee
at
the
ford
of
jabbok
at
the
place
of
peniel
against
the
tremulous
blue
and
silver
of
the
forest
the
princess
saw
how
horribly
the
big
man
was
shaken
my
hire
my
hire
he
hoarsely
said
forty
long
years
my
father
and
now
i
will
not
let
thee
go
except
thou
hear
me
and
grant
me
life
and
this
woman
love
he
turned
stark
and
black
in
the
rearward
splendor
of
the
moon
as
a
prince
hast
thou
power
with
god
he
calmly
said
and
thou
hast
for
the
king
of
kings
was
never
obdurate
my
dear
to
them
that
have
deserved
well
of
him
so
he
will
attend
to
my
request
and
will
get
us
out
of
this
pickle
somehow
even
as
he
said
this
philippe
the
handsome
came
into
the
room
and
at
the
heels
of
the
french
king
were
seven
lords
armed
the
french
king
was
an
odd
man
subtly
smiling
he
came
forward
through
the
twilight
with
soft
long
strides
and
he
made
no
outcry
at
recognition
of
his
sister
take
the
woman
away
victor
he
said
disinterestedly
to
de
montespan
afterward
he
sat
down
beside
the
table
and
remained
silent
for
a
while
intently
regarding
sire
edward
and
the
tiny
woman
who
clung
to
sire
edward
arm
and
in
the
flickering
gloom
of
the
hut
philippe
smiled
as
an
artist
may
smile
who
gazes
on
the
perfected
work
and
knows
it
to
be
adroit
you
prefer
to
remain
my
sister
he
said
presently
hé
bien
it
happens
that
i
am
in
a
mood
for
granting
almost
any
favor
a
little
later
and
i
will
attend
to
your
merits
the
fleet
disorder
of
his
visage
had
lapsed
again
into
the
meditative
smile
which
was
that
of
lucifer
watching
a
toasted
soul
and
so
it
ends
he
said
and
england
loses
the
heir
that
manuel
the
redeemer
provided
conqueror
of
scotland
scourge
of
france
o
unconquerable
king
and
will
the
worms
of
ermenoueïl
then
pause
to
consider
through
what
a
glorious
turmoil
their
dinner
came
to
them
do
you
design
to
murder
me
sire
edward
said
the
french
king
shrugged
i
design
that
within
this
moment
my
lords
shall
slay
you
while
i
sit
here
and
do
not
move
a
finger
is
it
not
good
to
be
a
king
my
cousin
and
to
sit
quite
still
and
to
see
your
bitterest
enemy
hacked
and
slain
and
all
the
while
to
sit
quite
still
quite
unruffled
as
a
king
should
always
be
eh
eh
i
never
lived
until
now
by
heaven
said
sire
edward
i
am
your
kinsman
and
your
guest
i
am
unarmed
philippe
bowed
his
head
undoubtedly
he
assented
the
deed
is
foul
but
i
desire
gascony
very
earnestly
and
so
long
as
you
live
you
will
never
permit
me
to
retain
gascony
hence
it
is
quite
necessary
you
conceive
that
i
murder
you
what
he
presently
said
will
you
not
beg
for
mercy
i
had
hoped
the
french
king
added
somewhat
wistfully
that
you
might
be
afraid
to
die
o
huge
and
righteous
man
and
would
entreat
me
to
spare
you
to
spurn
the
weeping
conqueror
of
llewellyn
say
but
these
sins
which
damn
one
soul
are
in
actual
performance
very
tedious
affairs
and
i
begin
to
grow
aweary
of
the
game
hé
bien
now
kill
this
man
for
me
messieurs
the
english
king
strode
forward
shallow
trickster
sire
edward
thundered
am
i
not
afraid
you
grimacing
baby
do
you
think
to
ensnare
a
lion
with
such
a
flimsy
wise
persons
do
not
hunt
lions
with
these
contraptions
for
it
is
the
nature
of
a
fair
cousin
to
ensnare
not
the
beast
which
imperiously
desires
and
takes
in
daylight
but
the
tinier
and
the
filthier
beast
that
covets
meanly
and
attacks
under
the
cover
of
darkness
as
do
you
and
your
seven
skulkers
the
man
was
rather
terrible
not
a
frenchman
within
the
hut
but
had
drawn
back
a
little
listen
sire
edward
said
and
he
came
yet
farther
toward
the
king
of
france
and
shook
at
him
one
forefinger
when
you
were
in
your
cradle
i
was
leading
armies
when
you
were
yet
unbreeched
i
was
lord
of
half
europe
for
thirty
years
i
have
driven
kings
before
me
as
did
fierabras
am
i
then
a
person
to
be
hoodwinked
by
the
first
huzzy
that
elects
to
waggle
her
fat
shoulders
and
to
grant
an
assignation
in
a
forest
expressly
designed
for
stabbings
you
baby
is
the
hammer
of
the
scots
the
man
to
trust
for
one
half
moment
a
capet
infant
the
king
said
with
bitter
laughter
it
is
now
necessary
that
i
summon
my
attendants
and
remove
you
to
a
nursery
which
i
have
prepared
in
england
he
set
the
horn
to
his
lips
and
blew
three
blasts
there
came
many
armed
warriors
into
the
hut
bearing
ropes
here
was
the
entire
retinue
of
the
earl
of
aquitaine
cursing
sire
philippe
sprang
upon
the
english
king
and
with
a
dagger
smote
at
the
impassive
big
man
heart
the
blade
broke
against
the
mail
armor
under
the
tunic
have
i
not
told
you
sire
edward
wearily
said
that
one
may
never
trust
a
capet
now
messieurs
bind
these
carrion
and
convey
them
whither
i
have
directed
you
nay
but
roger
he
conversed
apart
with
his
son
the
earl
of
pevensey
and
what
sire
edward
commanded
was
done
the
french
king
and
seven
lords
of
france
went
from
that
hut
trussed
like
chickens
ready
for
the
oven
and
now
sire
edward
turned
toward
meregrett
and
chafed
his
big
hands
gleefully
at
every
a
tethered
horse
awaits
us
and
a
ship
awaits
our
party
at
fécamp
we
sleep
in
england
and
mort
de
dieu
do
you
not
think
madame
that
once
within
my
very
persuasive
tower
of
london
your
brother
and
i
may
come
to
some
agreement
over
guienne
she
had
shrunk
from
him
then
the
trap
was
yours
it
was
you
that
lured
my
brother
to
this
infamy
in
effect
i
planned
it
many
months
ago
at
ipswich
yonder
sire
edward
gayly
said
faith
of
a
gentleman
your
brother
has
cheated
me
of
guienne
and
was
i
to
waste
eternity
in
begging
him
to
give
me
back
my
province
oh
no
for
i
have
many
spies
in
france
and
have
for
some
two
years
known
your
brother
and
your
sister
to
the
bottom
granted
that
i
came
hither
incognito
to
forecast
your
kinfolk
immediate
endeavors
was
none
too
difficult
and
i
wanted
guienne
and
in
consequence
the
person
of
your
brother
hah
death
of
my
life
does
not
the
seasoned
hunter
adapt
his
snare
to
the
qualities
of
his
prey
and
take
the
elephant
through
his
curiosity
as
the
snake
through
his
notorious
treachery
now
the
king
of
england
blustered
but
the
little
princess
wrung
her
hands
i
am
this
night
most
hideously
shamed
beau
sire
i
came
hither
to
aid
a
brave
man
infamously
trapped
and
instead
i
find
an
alert
spider
snug
in
his
cunning
web
and
patiently
waiting
until
the
gnats
of
france
fly
near
enough
eh
the
greater
fool
was
i
to
waste
my
labor
on
the
shrewd
and
evil
thing
which
has
no
more
need
of
me
than
i
of
it
and
now
let
me
go
hence
sire
unmolested
for
the
sake
of
chivalry
could
i
have
come
to
the
brave
man
i
had
dreamed
of
i
would
have
come
cheerily
through
the
murkiest
lane
of
hell
as
the
more
artful
knave
as
the
more
judicious
trickster
and
here
she
thrust
him
from
her
i
spit
upon
you
now
let
me
go
hence
he
took
her
in
his
brawny
arms
fit
mate
for
me
he
said
little
vixen
had
you
done
otherwise
i
would
have
devoted
you
to
the
devil
still
grasping
her
and
victoriously
lifting
dame
meregrett
so
that
her
feet
swung
clear
of
the
floor
sire
edward
said
again
with
that
queer
touch
of
fanatic
gravity
my
dear
you
are
perfectly
right
i
was
tempted
i
grant
you
but
it
was
never
reasonable
that
gentlefolk
should
cheat
at
their
dicing
therefore
i
whispered
roger
bulmer
my
final
decision
and
he
is
now
loosing
all
my
captives
in
the
courtyard
of
mezelais
after
birching
the
tails
of
every
one
of
them
as
soundly
as
these
infants
pranks
have
merited
so
you
perceive
that
i
do
not
profit
by
my
trick
and
that
i
lose
guienne
after
all
in
order
to
come
to
you
with
hands
well
not
intolerably
soiled
oh
now
i
love
you
she
cried
with
disappointment
to
find
him
so
unthriftily
yet
you
have
done
wrong
for
guienne
is
a
king
ransom
he
smiled
whimsically
and
presently
one
arm
swept
beneath
her
knees
so
that
presently
he
held
her
as
one
dandles
a
baby
and
presently
his
stiff
and
graying
beard
caressed
her
burning
cheek
masterfully
he
said
then
let
guienne
serve
as
such
and
ransom
for
a
king
his
glad
and
common
manhood
now
it
appears
expedient
that
i
leave
france
without
any
unwholesome
delay
because
these
children
may
resent
being
spanked
more
lately
hé
already
i
have
in
my
pocket
the
pope
dispensation
permitting
me
to
marry
in
spite
of
our
cousinship
the
sister
of
the
king
of
france
very
shyly
dame
meregrett
lifted
her
little
mouth
she
said
nothing
because
talk
was
not
necessary

tergiversation

of
a

whom

be

thus
nicolas
begins
you
could
have
found
in
all
england
no
couple
more
ardent
in
affection
or
in
despair
more
affluent
than
rosamund
eastney
and
sir
gregory
darrell
she
was
lord
berners
only
daughter
a
brown
beauty
of
extensive
repute
thanks
to
a
retinue
of
lovers
who
were
practitioners
of
the
gay
science
and
who
had
scattered
broadcast
innumerable
canzons
in
her
honor
and
lord
berners
was
a
man
to
accept
the
world
as
he
found
it
dompnedex
the
earl
was
wont
to
say
in
sincerity
i
am
fond
of
gregory
darrell
and
if
he
chooses
to
make
love
to
my
daughter
that
is
none
of
my
affair
the
eyes
and
the
brain
preserve
a
proverbial
warfare
which
is
the
source
of
all
amenity
for
without
there
would
be
no
songs
and
tourneys
no
measure
and
no
good
breeding
and
a
man
delinquent
in
domnei
is
no
more
to
be
valued
than
an
ear
of
corn
without
the
grain
no
i
am
so
profoundly
an
admirer
of
love
that
i
can
never
willingly
behold
him
slain
of
a
surfeit
by
matrimony
besides
this
rapscallion
gregory
could
not
to
advantage
exchange
purses
with
lazarus
in
the
parable
and
moreover
rosamund
is
to
marry
the
earl
of
sarum
a
little
after
all
saints
day
sarum
people
echoed
why
the
old
goat
has
had
four
wives
already
and
the
earl
would
spread
his
hands
these
redundancies
are
permissible
to
one
of
the
wealthiest
persons
in
england
he
was
used
to
submit
thus
it
fell
out
that
sir
gregory
came
and
went
at
his
own
discretion
as
concerned
lord
berners
fief
of
ordish
all
through
those
choppy
times
of
warfare
between
sire
edward
and
queen
ysabeau
lord
berners
for
one
vexed
himself
not
inordinately
over
the
outcome
since
he
protested
the
king
armament
to
consist
of
fools
and
the
queen
of
rascals
and
had
with
entire
serenity
declined
to
back
either
dick
or
the
devil
but
at
last
the
queen
got
resistless
aid
from
count
william
of
hainault
in
a
way
to
be
told
about
hereafter
and
the
king
was
captured
by
her
forces
and
was
imprisoned
in
berkeley
castle
there
they
held
the
second
edward
to
reign
in
england
who
was
the
unworthy
son
of
dame
ellinor
and
of
that
first
squinting
king
edward
about
whom
i
have
told
you
in
the
two
tales
preceding
this
tale
it
was
in
the
september
of
this
year
a
little
before
michaelmas
that
they
brought
sir
gregory
darrell
to
be
judged
by
the
queen
notoriously
the
knight
had
been
her
husband
adherent
death
croaked
adam
orleton
who
sat
to
the
right
hand
and
young
de
spencer
death
amended
the
earl
of
march
with
wild
laughter
but
ysabeau
leaned
back
in
her
great
chair
a
handsome
woman
stoutening
now
from
gluttony
and
from
too
much
wine
and
regarded
her
prisoner
with
lazy
amiability
and
what
was
your
errand
in
figgis
wood
she
demanded
or
are
you
mad
then
gregory
darrell
that
you
dare
ride
past
my
gates
alone
he
curtly
said
i
rode
for
ordish
followed
silence
roger
the
queen
ordered
give
me
the
paper
which
i
would
not
sign
the
earl
of
march
had
drawn
an
audible
breath
the
bishop
of
london
somewhat
wrinkled
his
shaggy
brows
like
a
person
in
shrewd
and
epicurean
amusement
while
the
queen
subscribed
the
parchment
with
a
great
scrawling
flourish
take
in
the
devil
name
the
hire
of
your
dexterities
said
ysabeau
she
pushed
this
document
with
her
wet
toward
march
so
get
it
over
with
that
necessary
business
with
my
husband
at
berkeley
and
do
the
rest
of
you
withdraw
saving
only
my
prisoner
followed
another
silence
queen
ysabeau
lolled
in
her
carven
chair
considering
the
comely
gentleman
who
stood
before
her
fettered
at
the
point
of
shameful
death
there
was
in
the
room
a
little
dog
which
had
come
to
the
queen
and
now
licked
the
palm
of
her
left
hand
and
the
soft
lapping
of
its
tongue
was
the
only
sound
you
heard
so
at
peril
of
your
life
you
rode
for
ordish
then
messire
the
tense
man
had
flushed
you
have
harried
us
of
the
king
party
out
of
england
and
in
reason
i
might
not
leave
england
without
seeing
the
desire
of
my
heart
my
friend
said
ysabeau
as
if
half
in
sorrow
i
would
have
pardoned
anything
save
that
she
rose
her
face
was
dark
and
hot
by
god
and
all
his
saints
you
shall
indeed
leave
england
and
the
world
also
but
not
without
a
final
glimpse
of
this
same
rosamund
yet
listen
i
too
must
ride
with
you
to
ordish
as
your
sister
say
gregory
did
i
not
hang
last
april
the
husband
of
your
sister
yes
ralph
de
belomys
a
thin
man
with
eager
eyes
the
earl
of
farrington
he
was
as
his
widow
i
will
ride
with
you
to
ordish
upon
condition
you
disclose
to
none
at
ordish
saving
only
if
you
will
this
quite
immaculate
rosamund
any
hint
of
our
merry
carnival
and
you
will
swear
according
to
the
nicest
obligations
of
honor
you
must
ride
back
with
me
to
encounter
that
which
i
may
devise
for
i
dare
to
trust
your
naked
word
in
this
and
moreover
i
shall
take
with
me
a
sufficiency
of
retainers
to
leave
you
no
choice
darrell
knelt
before
her
i
can
do
no
homage
to
queen
ysabeau
yet
the
prodigal
hands
of
her
who
knows
that
i
must
die
and
cunningly
contrives
for
old
time
sake
to
hearten
me
with
a
sight
of
rosamund
i
can
not
but
kiss
this
much
he
did
and
i
swear
in
all
things
to
obey
your
will
o
comely
fool
the
queen
said
not
ungently
i
contrive
it
may
be
but
to
demonstrate
that
many
tyrants
of
antiquity
were
only
bunglers
and
besides
i
must
have
other
thoughts
than
those
which
i
have
known
too
long
i
must
this
night
take
holiday
from
thinking
them
lest
i
go
mad
thus
did
the
queen
arrange
her
holiday
either
i
mean
to
torture
you
dame
ysabeau
said
presently
to
darrell
as
these
two
rode
side
by
side
or
else
i
mean
to
free
you
in
sober
verity
i
do
not
know
i
am
in
a
holiday
humor
and
it
is
as
the
whim
may
take
me
but
do
you
indeed
love
this
rosamund
eastney
and
of
course
she
worships
you
it
is
my
belief
madame
that
when
i
see
her
i
tremble
visibly
and
my
weakness
is
such
that
a
child
has
more
intelligence
than
i
and
toward
such
misery
any
lady
must
in
common
reason
be
a
little
compassionate
her
hands
had
twitched
so
that
the
astonished
palfrey
reared
i
design
torture
the
queen
said
ah
i
perfect
exquisite
torture
for
you
have
proven
recreant
you
have
forgotten
the
maid
ysabeau
le
desir
du
cuer
was
it
not
my
gregory
that
you
were
wont
to
call
her
as
nowadays
this
rosamund
is
the
desire
of
your
heart
you
lack
inventiveness
his
palms
clutched
at
heaven
that
ysabeau
is
dead
and
all
true
joy
is
destroyed
and
the
world
lies
under
a
blight
from
which
god
has
averted
an
unfriendly
face
in
displeasure
yet
of
all
wretched
persons
existent
i
am
he
who
endures
the
most
grievous
anguish
for
daily
i
partake
of
life
without
any
relish
and
i
would
in
truth
deem
him
austerely
kind
who
slew
me
now
that
the
maiden
ysabeau
is
dead
she
shrugged
wearily
i
scent
the
raw
stuff
of
a
planh
the
queen
observed
it
was
ever
your
way
my
friend
to
love
a
woman
chiefly
for
the
verses
she
inspired
and
she
began
to
sing
as
they
rode
through
baverstock
thicket
sang
ysabeau
man
love
hath
many
prompters
but
a
woman
love
hath
none
and
he
may
woo
a
nimble
wit
or
hair
that
shames
the
sun
whilst
she
must
pick
of
all
one
man
and
ever
brood
thereon
and
for
no
reason
and
not
rightly
save
that
the
plan
was
foreordained
more
old
than
chalcedon
or
any
tower
of
tarshish
or
of
gleaming
babylon
that
she
must
love
unwillingly
and
love
till
life
be
done
he
for
a
season
and
more
lightly
so
to
ordish
in
that
twilight
came
the
countess
of
farrington
with
a
retinue
of
twenty
and
her
brother
sir
gregory
darrell
lord
berners
received
the
party
with
boisterous
hospitality
age
has
not
blinded
father
to
the
fact
that
your
sister
is
a
very
handsome
woman
was
rosamund
eastney
comment
the
period
appears
to
have
been
after
supper
and
the
girl
sat
with
gregory
darrell
in
not
the
most
brilliant
corner
of
the
main
hall
the
wretched
man
leaned
forward
bit
his
and
then
with
a
tumbling
rush
of
speech
told
of
the
sorry
masquerade
the
designs
some
horrible
and
obscure
mischief
she
plans
i
know
not
what
yet
i
said
rosamund
the
girl
had
risen
and
she
continued
with
an
odd
inconsequence
you
have
told
me
you
were
pembroke
squire
when
long
ago
he
sailed
for
france
to
fetch
this
woman
into
england
which
you
never
heard
lord
berners
shouted
at
this
point
jasper
a
lute
and
then
he
halloaed
gregory
madame
de
farrington
demands
that
racy
song
you
made
against
queen
ysabeau
during
your
last
visit
thus
did
the
queen
begin
her
holiday
it
was
a
handsome
couple
which
came
forward
with
hand
quitting
hand
tardily
and
with
blinking
eyes
yet
rapt
these
two
were
not
overpleased
at
being
disturbed
and
the
man
was
troubled
as
in
reason
he
well
might
be
by
the
task
assigned
him
is
it
indeed
your
will
my
sister
he
said
that
i
should
sing
this
song
it
is
my
will
the
countess
said
and
the
knight
flung
back
his
comely
head
and
laughed
a
truth
once
spoken
may
not
be
disowned
in
any
company
it
is
not
look
you
of
my
own
choice
that
i
sing
my
sister
yet
if
queen
ysabeau
herself
were
to
bid
me
sing
this
song
i
could
not
refuse
for
christ
aid
me
the
song
is
true
sang
sir
gregory
dame
ysabeau
la
prophécie
que
li
sage
dit
ne
ment
mie
que
la
royne
sut
ceus
grever
qui
tantost
laquais
sot
aymer
and
so
on
it
was
a
lengthy
ditty
and
in
its
wording
not
oversqueamish
the
queen
career
in
england
was
detailed
without
any
stuttering
and
you
would
have
found
the
catalogue
unhandsome
yet
sir
gregory
delivered
it
with
an
incisive
gusto
desperately
countersigning
his
own
death
warrant
her
treacheries
her
adulteries
and
her
assassinations
were
rendered
in
glowing
terms
whose
vigor
seemed
even
now
to
please
their
contriver
yet
the
minstrel
added
a
new
peroration
sang
sir
gregory
ma
voix
mocque
mon
cuer
gémit
peu
pense
à
ce
que
la
voix
dit
car
me
membre
du
temps

et
garson

et
fille
et
la

et
grandement

esbahi
and
when
darrell
had
ended
the
countess
of
farrington
without
speaking
swept
her
left
hand
toward
her
cheek
and
by
pure
chance
caught
between
thumb
and
forefinger
the
fly
that
had
annoyed
her
she
drew
the
little
dagger
from
her
girdle
and
meditatively
cut
the
buzzing
thing
in
two
she
cast
the
fragments
from
her
and
resting
the
dagger
point
upon
the
arm
of
her
chair
one
forefinger
upon
the
summit
of
the
hilt
considerately
twirled
the
brilliant
weapon
this
song
does
not
err
upon
the
side
of
clemency
she
said
at
last
nor
by
ordinary
does
queen
ysabeau
that
said
lord
berners
comfortably
hoo
madame
gertrude
since
the
prophet
moses
wrung
healing
waters
from
a
rock
there
has
been
no
such
miracle
recorded
we
read
messire
de
berners
that
when
the
once
acknowledges
a
master
she
will
follow
him
as
faithfully
as
any
dog
my
brother
i
do
not
question
your
sincerity
yet
everybody
knows
you
sing
with
the
voice
of
an
unhonored
courtier
suppose
queen
ysabeau
had
heard
your
song
all
through
as
i
have
heard
it
and
then
had
said
for
she
is
not
as
the
run
of
women
i
had
thought
until
this
that
there
was
no
thorough
man
in
england
save
tall
roger
mortimer
i
find
him
tawdry
now
and
i
remember
come
you
then
and
rule
the
england
that
you
love
as
you
may
love
no
woman
and
rule
me
messire
since
i
find
even
in
your
cruelty
for
we
are
no
pygmies
you
and
i
yonder
is
squabbling
europe
and
all
the
ancient
gold
of
africa
ready
for
our
taking
and
past
that
lies
asia
too
and
its
painted
houses
hung
with
bells
and
tartary
where
we
two
may
yet
erect
our
equal
thrones
upon
which
to
receive
the
tributary
emperors
for
we
are
no
pygmies
you
and
i
she
paused
she
shrugged
suppose
queen
ysabeau
who
is
not
as
the
run
of
women
had
said
this
much
my
brother
darrell
was
more
pallid
as
the
phrase
is
than
a
sheet
and
the
lute
had
dropped
unheeded
and
his
hands
were
clenched
i
would
answer
my
sister
that
as
she
has
found
in
england
but
one
man
i
have
found
in
england
but
one
woman
the
rose
of
all
the
world
his
eyes
were
turned
at
this
toward
rosamund
eastney
and
yet
the
man
stammered
because
i
too
remember
hah
in
god
name
i
am
answered
the
countess
said
she
rose
in
dignity
almost
a
queen
we
have
ridden
far
and
we
must
travel
a
deal
farther
eh
my
brother
i
am
going
to
bed
messire
de
berners
so
the
men
and
women
parted
madame
de
farrington
kissed
her
brother
at
leaving
him
as
was
natural
and
under
her
caress
his
stalwart
person
shuddered
but
not
in
repugnance
and
the
queen
went
away
singing
hushedly
sang
ysabeau
were
the
wise
life
shaped
anotherwise
would
be
all
high
and
true
could
i
be
otherwise
i
had
been
otherwise
simply
because
of
you
with
whom
i
have
naught
to
do
and
who
are
no
longer
you
life
with
its
pay
to
be
bade
us
essay
to
be
what
we
became
i
believe
were
there
a
way
to
be
what
it
was
play
to
be
i
would
not
greatly
grieve
hearts
are
not
worn
on
the
sleeve
let
us
neither
laugh
nor
grieve
ysabeau
would
have
slept
that
night
within
the
chamber
of
rosamund
eastney
had
either
slept
as
concerns
the
older
i
say
nothing
the
girl
though
soon
aware
of
frequent
rustlings
near
at
hand
lay
quiet
of
the
poisonous
woman
yonder
the
girl
was
now
fulfilled
with
a
great
blaze
of
exultation
gregory
must
die
and
then
perhaps
she
might
find
time
for
tears
meanwhile
before
her
eyes
the
man
had
flung
away
a
kingdom
and
life
itself
for
love
of
her
and
the
least
nook
of
her
heart
ached
to
be
a
shade
more
worthy
of
the
sacrifice
after
it
might
have
been
an
hour
of
this
excruciate
ecstasy
the
countess
came
to
rosamund
bed
ay
the
woman
began
it
is
indisputable
that
his
hair
is
like
spun
gold
and
that
his
eyes
resemble
waters
in
june
it
is
certain
that
when
this
gregory
laughs
god
is
more
happy
girl
i
was
familiar
with
the
routine
of
your
meditations
before
you
were
born
rosamund
said
quite
simply
you
have
known
him
always
i
envy
the
circumstance
madame
gertrude
you
alone
of
all
women
in
the
world
i
envy
since
you
his
sister
being
so
much
older
must
have
known
him
always
i
know
him
to
the
core
my
girl
the
countess
answered
for
a
while
she
sat
silent
one
bare
foot
jogging
restlessly
yet
i
am
two
years
his
junior
did
you
hear
nothing
rosamund
no
madame
gertrude
i
heard
nothing
strange
the
countess
said
let
us
have
lights
since
i
can
no
longer
endure
this
overpopulous
twilight
she
kindled
with
twitching
fingers
three
lamps
it
is
as
yet
dark
yonder
where
the
shadows
quiver
very
oddly
as
though
they
would
rise
from
the
floor
do
they
not
my
girl
and
protest
vain
things
but
rosamund
it
has
been
done
in
the
moment
of
death
men
souls
have
travelled
farther
and
have
been
visible
it
has
been
done
i
tell
you
and
he
would
stand
before
me
with
pleading
eyes
and
would
reproach
me
in
a
voice
too
faint
to
reach
my
ears
but
i
would
see
him
and
his
groping
hands
would
clutch
at
my
hands
as
though
a
dropped
veil
had
touched
me
and
with
the
contact
i
would
go
mad
madame
gertrude
the
girl
stammered
in
communicated
terror
poor
innocent
fool
the
woman
said
i
am
ysabeau
of
france
and
when
rosamund
made
as
though
to
rise
in
alarm
queen
ysabeau
caught
her
by
the
shoulder
bear
witness
when
he
comes
that
i
never
hated
him
yet
for
my
quiet
it
was
necessary
that
it
suffer
so
cruelly
the
scented
pampered
body
and
no
mark
be
left
upon
it
eia
even
now
he
suffers
no
i
have
lied
i
hate
the
man
and
in
such
fashion
as
you
will
comprehend
when
you
are
sarum
wife
madame
and
queen
the
girl
said
you
will
not
murder
me
i
am
tempted
the
queen
answered
o
little
slip
of
girlhood
i
am
tempted
for
it
is
not
reasonable
you
should
possess
everything
that
i
have
lost
innocence
you
have
and
youth
and
untroubled
eyes
and
quiet
dreams
and
the
fond
graveness
of
a
child
and
gregory
darrell
love
now
ysabeau
sat
down
upon
the
bed
and
caught
up
the
girl
face
between
two
fevered
hands
rosamund
this
darrell
perceives
within
the
moment
as
i
do
that
the
love
he
bears
for
you
is
but
what
he
remembers
of
the
love
he
bore
a
certain
maid
long
dead
eh
you
might
have
been
her
sister
rosamund
for
you
are
very
like
her
and
she
poor
wench
why
i
could
see
her
now
i
think
were
my
eyes
not
blurred
somehow
almost
as
though
queen
ysabeau
might
weep
but
she
was
handsomer
than
you
since
your
complexion
is
not
overclear
praise
god
woman
against
woman
they
were
he
has
told
me
of
his
intercourse
with
you
the
girl
said
and
this
was
a
lie
flatfooted
nay
kill
me
if
you
will
madame
since
you
are
the
stronger
yet
with
my
dying
breath
i
protest
that
gregory
has
loved
no
woman
truly
in
all
his
life
except
me
the
queen
laughed
bitterly
do
i
not
know
men
he
told
you
nothing
and
he
hesitated
and
at
the
lifting
of
my
finger
he
will
supplicate
since
boyhood
gregory
darrell
has
loved
me
o
white
palsied
innocence
and
he
is
mine
at
a
whistle
and
in
that
time
to
come
he
will
desert
you
rosamund
bidding
farewell
with
a
pleasing
canzon
and
they
will
give
you
to
the
gross
earl
of
sarum
as
they
gave
me
to
the
painted
man
who
was
of
late
our
king
and
in
that
time
to
come
you
will
know
your
body
to
be
your
husband
makeshift
when
he
lacks
leisure
to
seek
out
other
recreation
and
in
that
time
to
come
you
will
long
for
death
and
presently
your
heart
will
be
a
flame
within
you
my
rosamund
an
insatiable
flame
and
you
will
hate
your
god
because
he
made
you
and
hate
satan
because
in
some
desperate
hour
he
tricked
you
and
hate
all
men
because
poor
fools
they
scurry
to
obey
your
whims
and
chiefly
you
will
hate
yourself
because
you
are
so
pitiable
and
devastation
only
will
you
love
in
that
strange
time
which
is
to
come
it
is
adjacent
my
rosamund
the
girl
kept
silence
she
sat
erect
in
the
tumbled
bed
her
hands
clasping
her
knees
and
she
appeared
to
deliberate
what
dame
ysabeau
had
said
plentiful
brown
hair
fell
about
this
rosamund
face
which
was
white
and
shrewd
a
part
of
what
you
say
madame
i
understand
i
know
that
gregory
darrell
loves
me
yet
i
have
long
ago
acknowledged
he
loves
me
as
one
pets
a
child
or
let
us
say
a
spaniel
which
reveres
and
amuses
one
i
lack
his
wit
you
comprehend
and
so
he
never
speaks
to
me
all
that
he
thinks
yet
a
part
of
it
he
tells
me
and
he
loves
me
and
with
this
i
am
content
assuredly
if
they
give
me
to
sarum
i
shall
hate
sarum
even
more
than
i
detest
him
now
and
then
i
think
heaven
help
me
that
i
would
not
greatly
grieve
oh
you
are
all
evil
rosamund
said
and
you
thrust
into
my
mind
thoughts
which
i
may
not
understand
you
will
comprehend
them
the
queen
said
when
you
know
yourself
a
chattel
bought
and
paid
for
the
queen
laughed
she
rose
and
her
hands
strained
toward
heaven
you
are
omnipotent
yet
have
you
let
me
become
that
into
which
i
am
transmuted
she
said
very
low
she
began
to
speak
as
though
a
statue
spoke
through
lips
that
seemed
motionless
men
have
long
urged
me
rosamund
to
a
deed
which
by
one
stroke
would
make
me
mistress
of
these
islands
i
looked
on
gregory
darrell
and
knew
that
i
was
wise
in
love
and
i
had
but
to
crush
a
lewd
soft
worm
to
come
to
him
eh
and
i
was
tempted
the
girl
said
let
us
grant
that
gregory
loves
you
very
greatly
and
me
just
when
his
leisure
serves
you
may
offer
him
a
cushioned
infamy
a
colorful
and
brief
delirium
and
afterward
demolishment
of
soul
and
body
i
offer
him
contentment
and
a
level
life
made
up
of
small
events
it
may
be
and
lacking
both
in
abysses
and
in
skyey
heights
yet
is
love
a
flame
wherein
the
lover
soul
must
be
purified
it
is
a
flame
which
assays
high
queens
just
as
it
does
their
servants
and
thus
madame
to
judge
between
us
i
dare
summon
you
child
child
the
queen
said
tenderly
and
with
a
smile
you
are
brave
and
in
your
fashion
you
are
wise
yet
you
will
never
comprehend
but
once
i
was
in
heart
and
soul
and
body
all
that
you
are
and
now
i
am
queen
ysabeau
did
you
in
truth
hear
nothing
rosamund
why
nothing
save
the
wind
strange
said
the
queen
since
all
the
while
that
i
have
talked
with
you
i
have
been
seriously
annoyed
by
shrieks
and
imprecations
but
i
too
grow
cowardly
it
may
be
nay
i
know
she
said
and
in
a
resonant
voice
that
by
this
i
am
mistress
of
broad
england
until
my
son
my
own
son
born
of
my
body
and
in
glad
anguish
rosamund
knows
me
for
what
i
am
for
i
have
heard
coward
o
beautiful
sleek
coward
the
queen
said
i
would
have
died
without
lamentation
and
i
was
but
your
plaything
madame
ysabeau
the
girl
answered
vaguely
for
she
was
puzzled
and
was
almost
frightened
by
the
other
strange
talk
to
bed
said
ysabeau
and
put
out
the
lights
lest
he
come
presently
or
perhaps
he
fears
me
now
too
much
to
come
yet
the
night
approaches
none
the
less
when
i
must
lift
some
arras
and
find
him
there
with
painted
cheeks
and
rigid
and
smiling
very
terribly
or
look
into
some
mirror
and
behold
there
not
myself
but
him
and
in
that
instant
i
shall
die
meantime
i
rule
until
my
son
attains
his
manhood
eh
rosamund
my
only
son
was
once
so
tiny
and
so
helpless
and
his
little
crimson
mouth
groped
toward
me
helplessly
and
save
in
bethlehem
i
thought
there
was
never
any
child
more
fair
but
i
must
forget
all
that
for
even
now
he
plots
hey
god
orders
matters
very
shrewdly
my
rosamund
timidly
the
girl
touched
ysabeau
shoulder
in
part
i
understand
madame
and
queen
you
understand
nothing
said
ysabeau
how
should
you
understand
whose
breasts
are
yet
so
tiny
so
let
us
put
out
the
light
though
i
dread
darkness
rosamund
for
they
say
that
hell
is
poorly
lighted
and
they
say
then
queen
ysabeau
shrugged
pensively
she
blew
out
each
lamp
we
know
this
gregory
darrell
the
queen
said
in
the
darkness
ah
to
the
marrow
we
know
him
however
steadfastly
we
blink
and
we
know
the
present
turmoil
of
his
soul
and
in
what
chance
have
you
of
victory
none
in
madame
and
yet
you
go
too
fast
for
man
is
a
being
of
mingled
nature
we
are
told
by
those
in
holy
orders
and
his
life
here
is
one
unending
warfare
between
that
which
is
divine
in
him
and
that
which
is
bestial
while
impartial
heaven
attends
as
arbiter
of
the
tourney
always
a
man
judgment
misleads
him
and
his
faculties
allure
him
to
a
truce
however
brief
with
iniquity
his
senses
raise
a
mist
about
his
goings
and
there
is
not
an
endowment
of
the
man
but
in
the
end
plays
traitor
to
his
interest
as
of
god
wisdom
god
intends
so
that
when
the
man
is
overthrown
the
eternal
father
may
in
reason
be
neither
vexed
nor
grieved
if
only
the
man
takes
heart
to
rise
again
and
when
betrayed
and
impotent
the
man
elects
to
fight
out
the
allotted
battle
defiant
of
and
of
the
counsellors
which
god
himself
accorded
i
think
that
the
saints
hold
festival
in
heaven
a
very
pretty
sermon
said
the
queen
yet
i
do
not
think
that
our
gregory
could
very
long
endure
a
wife
given
over
to
such
talking
he
prefers
to
hear
himself
do
the
fine
talking
followed
a
silence
vexed
only
on
the
purposeless
september
winds
but
i
believe
that
neither
of
these
two
slept
with
profundity
about
dawn
one
of
the
queen
attendants
roused
sir
gregory
darrell
and
conducted
him
into
the
hedged
garden
of
ordish
where
ysabeau
walked
in
tranquil
converse
with
lord
berners
the
old
man
was
in
high
my
lad
said
he
and
clapped
sir
gregory
upon
the
shoulder
you
have
i
do
protest
the
very
phoenix
of
sisters
i
was
never
happier
and
he
went
away
chuckling
the
queen
said
in
a
toneless
voice
we
ride
for
blackfriars
now
darrell
responded
i
am
content
and
ask
but
leave
to
speak
briefly
with
dame
rosamund
before
i
die
then
the
woman
came
more
near
to
him
i
am
not
used
to
beg
but
within
this
hour
you
encounter
death
and
i
have
loved
no
man
in
all
my
life
saving
only
you
sir
gregory
darrell
nor
have
you
loved
any
person
as
you
loved
me
once
in
france
oh
i
may
speak
freely
for
with
you
the
doings
of
that
boy
and
girl
are
matters
overpast
yet
were
it
otherwise
eh
weigh
the
matter
carefully
for
i
am
mistress
of
england
now
and
england
would
i
give
you
and
such
love
as
that
slim
white
innocence
has
never
dreamed
of
would
i
give
you
gregory
darrell
no
no
ah
mother
of
god
not
you
the
queen
clapped
one
hand
upon
his
lips
listen
she
quickly
said
i
spoke
to
tempt
you
but
you
saw
and
you
saw
clearly
that
it
was
the
sickly
whim
of
a
wanton
and
you
never
dreamed
of
yielding
for
you
love
this
rosamund
eastney
and
you
know
me
to
be
vile
then
have
a
care
of
me
the
strange
woman
am
i
of
whom
we
read
that
her
house
is
the
way
to
hell
going
down
to
the
chambers
of
death
hoh
many
strong
men
have
been
slain
by
me
and
in
the
gray
time
to
come
will
many
others
be
slain
by
me
it
may
be
but
never
you
among
them
my
gregory
who
are
more
wary
and
more
merciful
and
who
know
that
i
have
need
to
lay
aside
at
least
one
comfortable
thought
against
eternity
i
concede
you
to
have
been
unwise
he
hoarsely
began
about
them
fell
the
dying
leaves
of
many
glorious
colors
but
the
air
of
this
new
day
seemed
raw
and
chill
then
rosamund
came
through
the
opening
in
the
hedge
now
choose
she
said
the
woman
offers
life
and
high
place
and
wealth
and
it
may
be
a
greater
love
than
i
am
capable
of
giving
you
i
offer
a
dishonorable
death
within
the
moment
and
again
with
that
peculiar
and
imperious
gesture
the
man
flung
back
his
head
and
he
laughed
said
gregory
darrell
i
am
i
and
i
will
so
to
live
that
i
may
face
without
shame
not
only
god
but
also
my
own
scrutiny
he
wheeled
upon
the
queen
and
spoke
henceforward
very
leisurely
i
love
you
all
my
life
long
i
have
loved
you
ysabeau
and
even
now
i
love
you
and
you
too
dear
rosamund
i
love
though
with
a
difference
and
every
fibre
of
my
being
lusts
for
the
power
that
you
would
give
me
ysabeau
and
for
the
good
which
i
would
do
with
it
in
the
england
which
i
or
blustering
roger
mortimer
must
rule
as
every
fibre
of
my
being
lusts
for
the
man
that
i
would
be
could
i
choose
death
without
debate
and
i
think
also
of
the
man
that
you
would
make
of
me
my
rosamund
the
man
and
what
is
this
man
this
gregory
darrell
that
his
welfare
should
be
considered
an
ape
who
chatters
to
himself
of
kinship
with

filthily

this
much
i
know
at
bottom

i
perceive
that
this
same
man
like
all
his
fellows
is
a
maimed
god
who
walks
the
world
dependent
upon
many
wise
and
evil
counsellors
he
must
measure
to
a
every
content
of
the
world
by
means
of
a
bloodied
sponge
tucked
somewhere
in
his
skull
a
sponge
which
is
ungeared
by
the
first
cup
of
wine
and
ruined
by
the
touch
of
his
own
finger
he
must
appraise
all
that
he
judges
with
no
better
instruments
than
two
bits
of
colored
jelly
with
a
bungling
makeshift
so
maladroit
that
the
nearest
horologer
apprentice
could
have
devised
a
more
accurate
device
in
fine
each
man
is
under
penalty
condemned
to
compute
eternity
with
false
weights
to
estimate
infinity
with
a

he
very
often
does
it
and
chooses
his
own
death
without
debate
for

then
i
do
that
which
i
would
not

consent
unto
the
law
saith
even
an
apostle
yet
a
braver
pagan
answers
him
at

that

better
and

by
the

there
lies
the
choice
which
every
man
must
face
whether
rationally
as
his
reason
goes
to
accept
his
own
limitations
and
make
the
best
of
his
allotted

stupendously
to
play

fool
and
swear
even
to

while
his
own
judgment
shrieks
and
proves
a
flat
denial
that
he
is
at

omnipotent
you
have
chosen
long
ago
my
poor
proud
ysabeau
and
i
choose
now
and
differently
for
poltroon
that
i
am
being
now
in
a
cold
drench
of
terror
i
steadfastly
protest
i
am
not
very
much
afraid
and
i
choose
death
without
any
more
debate
it
was
toward
rosamund
that
the
queen
looked
and
smiled
a
little
pitifully
should
queen
ysabeau
be
angry
or
vexed
or
very
cruel
now
my
rosamund
for
at
bottom
she
is
glad
and
the
queen
said
also
i
give
you
back
your
plighted
word
i
ride
homeward
to
my
husks
but
you
remain
or
rather
the
countess
of
farrington
departs
for
the
convent
of
ambresbury
disconsolate
in
her
widowhood
and
desirous
to
have
done
with
worldly
affairs
it
is
most
natural
she
should
relinquish
to
her
beloved
and
only
brother
all
her
or
so
at
least
messire
de
berners
acknowledges
here
then
is
the
grant
my
gregory
that
conveys
to
you
those
lands
of
ralph
de
belomys
which
last
year
i
confiscated
and
this
tedious
messire
de
berners
is
willing
now
he
is
eager
to
have
you
for
a
about
them
fell
the
dying
leaves
of
many
glorious
colors
but
the
air
of
this
new
day
seemed
raw
and
chill
while
very
calmly
dame
ysabeau
took
sir
gregory
hand
and
laid
it
upon
the
hand
of
rosamund
eastney
our
paladin
is
in
the
outcome
a
mortal
man
and
therefore
i
do
not
altogether
envy
you
yet
he
has
his
moments
and
you
are
capable
serve
then
not
only
his
desires
but
mine
also
dear
rosamund
there
was
a
silence
the
girl
spoke
as
though
it
was
a
sacrament
i
will
madame
and
queen
thus
did
the
queen
end
her
holiday
a
little
later
the
countess
of
farrington
rode
from
ordish
with
all
her
train
save
one
and
riding
from
that
place
where
love
was
she
sang
very
softly
sang
ysabeau
as
with
her
dupes
dealt
circe
life
deals
with
hers
for
she
reshapes
them
without
mercy
and
shapes
them
swinishly
to
wallow
swinishly
and
for
eternity
though
harder
than
the
witch
was
life
changing
not
the
whole
transmutes
the
body
which
was
proud
garment
of
the
soul
and
briefly
drugs
the
soul
whose
ruin
is
her
goal
and
means
by
this
thereafter
a
subtler
mirth
to
get
and
mock
with
bitterer
laughter
her
helpless
dupes
regret
their
swinish
dull
regret
for
what
they
half
forget
and
within
the
hour
came
hubert
frayne
to
ordish
on
a
horse

he
rode

announce
to
the
king

murder

disused
armor

harkee
frayne
if
you
pass
the
countess
of
farrington
company
speak
no
syllable
of
your
news

it
is
not
convenient
that
a
lady
so
thoroughly
and
so
lord

how
i
have
fattened
so
intent
on
holy
things

should

hey

laughed
very
bitterly

in

upon

some
three
hours
after
sunset
thus
nicolas
begins
had
you
visited
a
certain
garden
on
the
outskirts
of
valenciennes
you
might
there
have
stumbled
upon
a
big
handsome
boy
prone
on
the
turf
where
by
turns
he
groaned
and
vented
himself
in
sullen
curses
his
profanity
had
its
palliation
heir
to
england
though
he
was
you
must
know
that
this
boy
father
in
the
flesh
had
hounded
him
from
england
as
more
recently
had
the
uncle
charles
the
handsome
driven
him
from
france
now
had
this
boy
and
his
mother
the
same
queen
ysabeau
about
whom
i
have
told
you
in
the
preceding
tale
come
as
suppliants
to
the
court
of
that
stalwart
nobleman
sire
william
count
of
hainault
holland
and
zealand
and
lord
of
friesland
where
their
arrival
had
evoked
the
suggestion
that
they
depart
at
their
earliest
convenience
then
these
footsore
royalties
the
queen
of
england
and
the
prince
of
wales
would
be
thrust
to
resume
the
weary
beggarship
to
knock
again
upon
the
obdurate
gates
of
this
unsympathizing
king
or
that
deaf
emperor
accordingly
the
boy
aspersed
his
destiny
at
hand
a
nightingale
carolled
as
though
an
exiled
prince
were
the
blithest
spectacle
the
moon
knew
there
came
through
the
garden
a
tall
girl
running
stumbling
in
her
haste
hail
king
of
england
she
said
do
not
mock
me
philippa
the
boy
sulkily
he
rose
to
his
feet
no
mockery
here
my
fair
sweet
friend
no
i
have
told
my
father
all
which
happened
yesterday
i
pleaded
for
you
he
questioned
me
very
closely
and
when
i
had
ended
he
stroked
his
beard
and
presently
struck
one
hand
upon
the
table
of
the
mouth
of
babes
he
said
then
he
said
dear
i
believe
for
certain
that
this
lady
and
her
son
have
been
driven
from
their
kingdom
wrongfully
if
it
be
for
the
good
of
god
to
comfort
the
afflicted
how
much
more
is
it
commendable
to
help
and
succor
one
who
is
the
daughter
of
a
king
descended
from
royal
lineage
and
to
whose
blood
we
ourselves
are
related
and
accordingly
he
and
your
mother
have
their
heads
together
yonder
planning
an
invasion
of
england
no
less
and
the
dethronement
of
your
wicked
father
my
edward
and
accordingly
hail
king
of
england
the
girl
clapped
her
hands
gleefully
the
nightingale
sang
but
the
boy
kept
momentary
silence
not
even
in
youth
were
the
men
of
his
race
handicapped
by
excessively
tender
hearts
yesterday
in
the
shrubbery
the
boy
had
kissed
this
daughter
of
count
william
in
part
because
she
was
a
healthy
and
handsome
person
and
partly
because
great
benefit
might
come
of
an
alliance
with
her
father
well
the
prince
had
found
not
unfortunate
with
the
episode
as
foundation
count
william
had
already
builded
up
the
future
queenship
of
england
the
strong
count
could
do
and
as
it
seemed
was
now
in
train
to
do
indomitable
deeds
to
serve
his
and
now
the
beggar
of
five
minutes
since
foresaw
himself
with
this
girl
love
as
ladder
mounting
to
the
high
habitations
of
the
king
of
england
the
lord
of
ireland
and
the
duke
of
aquitaine
thus
they
would
herald
him
so
he
embraced
the
girl
hail
queen
of
england
said
the
prince
and
then
if
i
forget
his
voice
broke
awkwardly
my
dear
if
ever
i
forget
their
lips
met
now
the
nightingale
discoursed
as
if
on
a
wager
presently
was
mingled
with
the
bird
descant
another
kind
of
singing
beyond
the
as
these
two
stood
silent
breast
to
breast
passed
young
jehan
kuypelant
one
of
the
pages
fitting
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
lute
his
paraphrase
of
the
song
which
archilochus
of
sicyon
very
anciently
made
in
honor
of
venus
melaenis
the
tender
venus
of
the
dark
at
a
gap
in
the
hedge
the
young
brabanter
paused
his
singing
ended
gulped
these
two
who
stood
heart
hammering
against
heart
saw
for
an
instant
jehan
kuypelant
lean
face
silvered
by
the
moonlight
his
mouth
a
tiny
abyss
followed
the
beat
of
lessening
footfalls
while
the
nightingale
improvised
an
envoi
but
earlier
jehan
kuypelant
also
had
sung
as
though
in
rivalry
with
the
bird
sang
jehan
kuypelant
hearken
and
heed
melaenis
for
all
that
the
litany
ceased
when
time
had
pilfered
the
victim
and
flouted
thy
priest
and
set
astir
in
the
temple
where
burned
the
fires
of
thy
shrine
the
owls
and
wolves
of
the
desert
yet
hearken
the
issue
is
thine
and
let
the
heart
of
atys
at
last
at
last
be
mine
for
i
have
followed
nor
faltered
adrift
in
a
land
of
dreams
where
laughter
and
pity
and
terror
commingle
as
confluent
streams
i
have
seen
and
adored
the
sidonian
implacable
fair
and
divine
and
bending
low
have
implored
thee
to
hearken
the
issue
is
thine
and
let
the
heart
of
atys
at
last
at
last
be
mine
it
is
time
however
that
we
quit
this
subject
and
speak
of
other
matters
just
twenty
years
later
on
one
august
day
in
the
year
of
grace
master
john
copeland
as
men
now
called
jehan
kuypelant
now
secretary
to
the
queen
of
england
brought
his
mistress
the
unhandsome
tidings
that
david
bruce
had
invaded
her
realm
with
forty
thousand
scots
to
back
him
the
brabanter
found
plump
queen
philippa
with
the
kingdom
arbitress
dame
catherine
de
salisbury
whom
king
edward
third
of
that
name
to
reign
in
britain
and
now
warring
in
france
very
notoriously
adored
and
obeyed
this
king
indeed
had
been
despatched
into
france
chiefly
they
narrate
to
release
the
countess
husband
william
de
montacute
from
the
french
prison
of
the
châtelet
you
may
appraise
her
dominion
by
this
fact
chaste
and
shrewd
she
had
denied
all
to
king
edward
and
in
consequence
he
could
deny
her
nothing
so
she
sent
him
to
fetch
back
her
husband
whom
she
almost
loved
that
armament
had
sailed
from
southampton
on
saint
george
day
these
two
women
then
shared
the
brabanter
execrable
news
already
northumberland
westmoreland
and
durham
were
the
broken
meats
of
king
david
the
countess
presently
exclaimed
let
them
weep
for
this
that
must
my
place
is
not
here
philippa
said
half
hopefully
do
you
forsake
sire
edward
catherine
madame
and
queen
the
countess
answered
in
this
world
every
man
must
scratch
his
own
back
my
lord
has
entrusted
to
me
his
castle
of
wark
his
fiefs
in
northumberland
these
i
hear
are
being
laid
waste
were
there
a
thousand
left
in
england
i
would
say
fight
as
it
is
our
men
are
yonder
in
france
and
the
island
is
defenceless
accordingly
i
ride
for
the
north
to
make
what
terms
i
may
with
the
king
of
scots
now
you
might
have
seen
the
queen
eye
brighten
undoubtedly
said
she
in
her
lord
absence
it
is
the
wife
part
to
defend
his
belongings
and
my
lord
fief
is
england
i
bid
you
catherine
and
when
the
countess
was
gone
philippa
turned
her
round
face
somewhat
dazed
and
flushed
she
betrays
him
she
compounds
with
the
scot
mother
of
christ
let
me
not
fail
a
ship
must
be
despatched
to
bid
sire
edward
return
said
the
secretary
otherwise
all
england
is
lost
not
so
john
copeland
we
must
let
sire
edward
complete
his
overrunning
of
france
if
such
be
the
trinity
will
you
know
perfectly
well
that
he
has
always
had
a
fancy
to
conquer
france
and
if
i
bade
him
return
now
he
would
be
vexed
the
disappointment
of
the
king
john
copeland
considered
is
a
smaller
evil
than
allowing
all
of
us
to
be
butchered
not
to
me
john
copeland
the
queen
said
now
came
many
lords
into
the
chamber
seeking
madame
philippa
we
must
make
peace
with
the
scottish
rascal
england
is
lost
a
ship
must
be
sent
entreating
succor
of
sire
edward
so
they
shouted
messieurs
said
queen
philippa
who
commands
here
am
i
then
some
woman
of
the
town
ensued
a
sudden
silence
john
copeland
standing
by
the
seaward
window
had
picked
up
a
lute
and
was
fingering
the
instrument
now
the
marquess
of
hastings
stepped
from
the
throng
pardon
highness
but
the
occasion
is
urgent
the
occasion
is
very
urgent
my
lord
the
queen
assented
deep
in
meditation
john
copeland
flung
back
his
head
and
without
prelude
began
to
carol
lustily
sang
john
copeland
there
are
taller
lads
than
atys
and
many
are
wiser
than
he
how
should
i
heed
them
whose
fate
is
ever
to
serve
and
to
be
ever
the
lover
of
atys
and
die
that
atys
may
dine
live
if
he
need
me
then
heed
me
and
speed
me
the
moment
is
thine
and
let
the
heart
of
atys
at
last
at
last
be
mine
fair
is
the
form
unbeholden
and
golden
the
glory
of
thee
whose
voice
is
the
voice
of
a
vision
whose
face
is
the
foam
of
the
sea
and
the
fall
of
whose
feet
is
the
flutter
of
breezes
in
birches
and
pine
when
thou
drawest
near
me
to
hear
me
and
cheer
me
the
moment
is
thine
and
let
the
heart
of
atys
at
last
at
last
be
mine
i
must
tell
you
that
the
queen
shivered
as
if
with
extreme
cold
she
gazed
toward
john
copeland
wonderingly
the
secretary
was
fretting
at
his
lutestrings
with
his
head
downcast
then
in
a
while
the
queen
turned
to
hastings
the
occasion
is
very
urgent
my
lord
the
queen
assented
therefore
it
is
my
will
that
one
and
all
your
men
be
mustered
at
blackheath
we
will
take
the
field
without
delay
against
the
king
of
scots
the
riot
began
anew
madness
they
shouted
lunar
madness
we
can
do
nothing
until
our
king
returns
with
our
army
in
his
absence
the
queen
said
i
command
here
you
are
not
regent
the
marquess
answered
then
he
cried
this
is
the
regent
affair
let
the
regent
be
fetched
dame
philippa
said
very
quietly
they
brought
in
her
son
messire
lionel
now
a
boy
of
eight
years
and
in
the
king
absence
regent
of
england
both
the
queen
and
the
marquess
held
papers
highness
lord
hastings
began
for
reasons
of
state
which
i
lack
time
to
explain
this
document
requires
your
signature
it
is
an
order
that
a
ship
be
despatched
to
ask
the
king
return
your
highness
may
remember
the
pony
you
admired
yesterday
the
marquess
smiled
ingratiatingly
just
here
your
highness
a
crossmark
the
dappled
one
said
the
regent
and
all
for
making
a
little
mark
the
boy
jumped
for
the
pen
lionel
said
the
queen
you
are
regent
of
england
but
you
are
also
my
son
if
you
sign
that
paper
you
will
beyond
doubt
get
the
pony
but
you
will
not
i
think
care
to
ride
him
you
will
not
care
to
sit
down
at
all
lionel
the
regent
considered
thank
you
very
much
my
lord
he
said
in
the
ultimate
but
i
do
not
like
ponies
any
more
do
i
sign
here
mother
philippa
handed
the
marquess
a
subscribed
order
to
muster
the
english
forces
at
blackheath
then
another
closing
the
english
ports
my
lords
the
queen
said
this
boy
is
the
king
vicar
in
defying
him
you
defy
the
king
yes
lionel
you
have
fairly
earned
a
pot
of
jam
for
supper
then
hastings
went
away
without
speaking
that
night
assembled
at
his
lodgings
by
appointment
viscount
heringaud
adam
frere
the
marquess
of
orme
lord
stourton
the
earls
of
neville
and
gage
and
sir
thomas
rokeby
these
seven
found
a
long
table
there
littered
with
pens
and
parchment
to
the
rear
of
it
with
a
lackey
behind
him
sat
the
marquess
of
hastings
meditative
over
a
cup
of
bordeaux
presently
hastings
said
my
friends
in
creating
our
womankind
the
maker
of
us
all
was
beyond
doubt
actuated
by
laudable
and
cogent
reasons
so
that
i
can
merely
lament
my
inability
to
fathom
these
reasons
i
shall
obey
the
queen
faithfully
since
if
i
did
otherwise
sire
edward
would
have
my
head
off
within
a
day
of
his
return
in
consequence
i
do
not
consider
it
convenient
to
oppose
his
vicar
i
shall
assemble
the
tatters
of
troops
which
remain
to
us
and
we
march
northward
to
inevitable
defeat
i
am
sending
a
courier
into
northumberland
he
is
an
obliging
person
and
would
convey
to
cite
an
instance
eight
letters
quite
as
blithely
as
one
each
man
glanced
furtively
about
england
was
in
a
panic
by
this
and
knew
itself
to
lie
before
the
bruce
defenceless
the
countess
of
salisbury
had
compounded
with
king
david
now
hastings
too
their
generalissimo
compounded
what
the
devil
loyalty
was
a
sonorous
word
and
so
was
patriotism
but
after
all
one
had
estates
in
the
north
the
seven
wrote
in
silence
i
must
tell
you
that
when
they
had
ended
hastings
gathered
the
letters
into
a
heap
and
without
glancing
at
the
superscriptures
handed
all
these
letters
to
the
attendant
lackey
for
the
courier
he
said
the
fellow
left
the
apartment
presently
you
heard
a
departing
clatter
of
hoofs
and
hastings
rose
he
was
a
gaunt
terrible
old
man
and
having
high
eyebrows
that
twitched
and
jerked
we
have
saved
our
precious
skins
said
he
hey
you
fidgeters
you
ferments
of
sour
offal
i
commend
your
messieurs
and
i
request
you
to
withdraw
even
a
damned
rogue
such
as
i
has
need
of
a
cleaner
atmosphere
in
order
to
breathe
comfortably
the
seven
went
away
without
further
speech
they
narrate
that
next
day
the
troops
marched
for
durham
where
the
queen
took
up
her
quarters
the
bruce
had
pillaged
and
burned
his
way
to
a
place
called
beaurepair
within
three
miles
of
the
city
he
sent
word
to
the
queen
that
if
her
men
were
willing
to
come
forth
from
the
town
he
would
abide
and
give
them
battle
she
replied
that
she
accepted
his
offer
and
that
the
barons
would
gladly
risk
their
lives
for
the
realm
of
their
lord
the
king
the
bruce
grinned
and
kept
silence
since
he
had
in
his
pocket
letters
from
most
of
them
protesting
they
would
do
nothing
of
the
sort
here
is
comedy
on
one
side
you
have
a
horde
of
savages
a
shrewd
master
holding
them
in
leash
till
the
moment
be
auspicious
on
the
other
a
housewife
at
the
head
of
a
tiny
force
lieutenanted
by
perjurers
by
men
already
purchased
god
knows
what
dreams
she
had
of
miraculous
victories
while
her
barons
trafficked
in
secret
with
the
bruce
it
is
recorded
that
on
the
saturday
before
michaelmas
when
the
opposing
armies
marshalled
in
the
bishop
park
at
auckland
not
a
captain
on
either
side
believed
the
day
to
be
pregnant
with
battle
there
would
be
a
decent
counterfeit
of
resistance
afterward
the
little
english
army
would
vanish
and
the
bruce
would
be
master
of
the
island
the
farce
was
prearranged
the
actors
therein
were
that
morning
at
daybreak
john
copeland
came
to
the
queen
tent
and
informed
her
quite
explicitly
how
matters
stood
he
had
been
drinking
overnight
with
adam
frere
and
the
earl
of
gage
and
after
the
third
bottle
had
found
them
candid
madame
and
queen
we
are
betrayed
the
marquess
of
hastings
our
commander
is
inexplicably
smitten
with
a
fever
he
will
not
fight
not
one
of
your
lords
will
fight
master
copeland
laid
bare
such
part
of
the
scheme
as
yesterday
conviviality
had
made
familiar
therefore
i
counsel
retreat
let
the
king
be
summoned
out
of
france
queen
philippa
shook
her
head
as
she
cut
up
squares
of
toast
and
dipped
them
in
milk
for
the
regent
breakfast
sire
edward
would
be
vexed
he
has
always
wanted
to
conquer
france
i
shall
visit
the
marquess
as
soon
as
lionel
is
fed
do
you
know
john
copeland
i
am
anxious
about
lionel
he
is
irritable
and
coughed
five
times
during
the
night
and
then
i
will
attend
to
this
affair
she
found
the
marquess
in
bed
groaning
the
coverlet
pulled
up
to
his
chin
pardon
highness
said
lord
hastings
but
i
am
an
ill
man
i
can
not
rise
from
this
couch
i
do
not
question
the
gravity
of
your
disorder
the
queen
retorted
since
it
is
well
known
that
the
same
illness
brought
about
the
death
of
iscariot
nevertheless
i
bid
you
get
up
and
lead
our
troops
against
the
scot
now
the
hand
of
the
marquess
veiled
his
countenance
i
am
an
ill
man
he
muttered
doggedly
i
can
not
rise
from
this
couch
there
was
a
silence
my
lord
the
queen
presently
began
without
is
an
army
prepared
yes
and
quite
able
to
defend
our
england
the
one
requirement
of
this
army
is
a
leader
afford
them
that
my
lord
ah
i
know
that
our
peers
are
sold
to
the
bruce
yet
our
yeomen
at
least
are
honest
give
them
then
a
leader
and
they
can
not
but
conquer
since
god
also
is
honest
and
incorruptible
pardieu
a
woman
might
lead
these
men
and
lead
them
to
victory
hastings
answered
i
am
ill
i
can
not
rise
from
this
couch
there
is
no
man
left
in
england
said
the
queen
since
sire
edward
went
into
france
praise
god
i
am
his
wife
she
went
away
without
flurry
through
the
hastings
beheld
all
that
which
followed
the
english
force
was
marshalled
in
four
divisions
each
commanded
by
a
bishop
and
a
baron
you
could
see
the
men
fidgeting
puzzled
by
the
delay
as
a
wind
goes
about
a
vague
rumors
were
going
about
those
wavering
spears
toward
them
rode
philippa
upon
a
white
palfrey
alone
and
perfectly
tranquil
her
eight
lieutenants
were
now
gathered
about
her
in
voluble
protestation
and
she
heard
them
out
afterward
she
spoke
without
any
particular
violence
as
one
might
order
a
strange
cur
from
his
room
then
the
queen
rode
on
as
though
these
eight
declaiming
persons
had
ceased
to
be
of
interest
she
reined
up
before
her
and
took
the
standard
in
her
hand
she
began
again
to
speak
and
immediately
the
army
was
in
an
uproar
the
barons
were
clustering
behind
her
in
stealthy
groups
of
two
or
three
whisperers
each
all
were
in
the
greatest
amazement
and
knew
not
what
to
do
but
the
army
was
shouting
the
queen
name
now
is
england
shamed
said
hastings
since
a
woman
alone
dares
to
encounter
the
scot
she
will
lead
them
into
battle
and
by
god
there
is
no
braver
person
under
heaven
than
yonder
dutch
frau
friend
david
i
perceive
that
your
venture
is
lost
for
those
men
would
follow
her
to
storm
hell
if
she
desired
it
he
meditated
and
shrugged
and
so
would
i
said
hastings
a
little
afterward
a
gaunt
and
haggard
old
man
bareheaded
and
very
hastily
dressed
reined
his
horse
by
the
queen
side
madame
and
queen
said
hastings
i
rejoice
that
my
recent
illness
is
departed
i
shall
by
god
grace
on
this
day
drive
the
bruce
from
england
philippa
was
not
given
to
verbiage
doubtless
she
had
her
emotions
but
none
was
visible
upon
the
honest
face
she
rested
one
plump
hand
upon
the
hand
of
hastings
that
was
all
i
welcome
back
the
gallant
gentleman
of
yesterday
i
was
about
to
lead
your
army
my
friend
since
there
was
no
one
else
to
do
it
but
i
was
hideously
afraid
at
bottom
every
woman
is
a
coward
you
were
afraid
to
do
it
said
the
marquess
but
you
were
going
to
do
it
because
there
was
no
one
else
to
do
it
ho
madame
had
i
an
army
of
such
cowards
i
would
drive
the
scot
not
past
the
border
but
beyond
the
orkneys
the
queen
then
said
but
you
are
unarmed
highness
he
replied
it
is
surely
apparent
that
i
who
have
played
the
traitor
to
two
monarchs
within
the
same
day
can
not
with
either
decency
or
comfort
survive
that
day
he
turned
upon
the
lords
and
bishops
twittering
about
his
horse
tail
you
merchandise
get
back
to
your
stations
and
if
there
was
ever
an
honest
woman
in
any
of
your
families
the
which
i
doubt
contrive
to
get
yourselves
killed
this
day
as
i
mean
to
do
in
the
cause
of
the
honestest
and
bravest
woman
our
time
has
known
immediately
the
english
forces
marched
toward
merrington
philippa
returned
to
her
pavilion
and
inquired
for
john
copeland
she
was
informed
that
he
had
ridden
off
armed
in
company
with
five
of
her
immediate
retainers
she
considered
this
strange
but
made
no
comment
you
picture
her
perhaps
as
spending
the
morning
in
prayer
in
beatings
upon
her
breast
and
in
lamentations
philippa
did
nothing
of
the
sort
she
considered
her
cause
to
be
so
clamantly
just
that
to
expatiate
to
the
holy
father
upon
its
merits
would
be
an
impertinence
it
was
not
conceivable
that
he
would
fail
her
and
in
any
event
she
had
in
hand
a
deal
of
sewing
which
required
immediate
attention
accordingly
she
settled
down
to
her
needlework
while
the
regent
of
england
leaned
his
head
against
her
knee
and
his
mother
told
him
that
ageless
tale
of
lord
huon
who
in
a
wood
near
babylon
encountered
the
king
of
faëry
and
subsequently
bereaved
an
atrocious
emir
of
his
beard
and
daughter
all
this
the
industrious
woman
narrated
in
a
low
and
pleasant
voice
while
the
regent
attended
and
at
the
proper
intervals
gulped
his
you
must
know
that
about
noon
master
john
copeland
came
into
the
tent
we
have
conquered
he
said
now
by
the
face
thus
scoffingly
he
used
her
husband
favorite
oath
now
by
the
face
there
was
never
a
victory
more
complete
the
scottish
army
is
fled
it
is
as
utterly
dispersed
from
man
seeing
as
are
the
sands
which
dried
the
letters
king
ahasuerus
gave
the
admirable
esther
i
rejoice
the
queen
said
looking
up
from
her
sewing
that
we
have
conquered
though
in
nature
i
expected
nothing
else
oh
horrible
she
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
cry
of
anguish
here
in
little
you
have
the
entire
woman
the
victory
of
her
armament
was
to
her
a
thing
of
course
since
her
cause
was
just
whereas
the
loss
of
two
front
teeth
by
john
copeland
was
a
calamity
he
drew
her
toward
the
which
he
opened
without
was
a
mounted
knight
in
full
panoply
his
arms
bound
behind
him
surrounded
by
the
queen
five
retainers
in
the
rout
i
took
him
said
john
copeland
though
as
my
mouth
witnesses
i
did
not
find
this
david
bruce
a
tractable
prisoner
is
that
then
the
king
of
scots
philippa
demanded
as
she
mixed
salt
and
water
for
a
mouthwash
sire
edward
should
be
pleased
i
think
will
he
not
love
me
a
little
now
john
copeland
john
copeland
lifted
both
plump
hands
toward
his
lips
he
could
not
choose
john
copeland
said
madame
he
could
no
more
choose
but
love
you
than
i
could
choose
philippa
sighed
afterward
she
bade
john
copeland
rinse
his
gums
and
then
take
his
prisoner
to
hastings
he
told
her
the
marquess
was
dead
slain
by
the
knight
of
liddesdale
that
is
a
pity
the
queen
said
she
reflected
a
while
reached
her
decision
there
is
left
alive
in
england
but
one
man
to
whom
i
dare
entrust
the
keeping
of
the
king
of
scots
my
barons
are
sold
to
him
if
i
retain
messire
david
by
me
one
or
another
lord
will
engineer
his
escape
within
the
week
and
sire
edward
will
be
vexed
yet
listen
john
she
unfolded
her
plan
i
have
long
known
he
said
when
she
had
done
that
in
all
the
world
there
was
no
lady
more
lovable
twenty
years
i
have
loved
you
my
queen
and
yet
it
is
only
i
perceive
that
in
all
the
world
there
is
no
lady
more
wise
than
you
philippa
touched
his
cheek
maternally
foolish
boy
you
tell
me
the
king
of
scots
has
an
in
his
nose
i
think
a
bread
poultice
would
be
best
she
told
him
how
to
make
this
poultice
and
gave
other
instructions
then
john
copeland
left
the
tent
and
presently
rode
away
with
his
company
philippa
saw
that
the
regent
had
his
dinner
and
afterward
mounted
her
white
palfrey
and
set
out
for
the
there
the
earl
of
neville
as
second
in
command
received
her
with
great
courtesy
god
had
shown
to
her
majesty
servants
most
singular
favor
despite
the
calculations
of
reasonable
men
to
which
she
might
remember
he
had
that
morning
taken
the
liberty
to
assent
some
fifteen
thousand
scots
were
slain
true
her
gallant
general
was
no
longer
extant
though
this
was
scarcely
astounding
when
one
considered
the
fact
that
he
had
voluntarily
entered
the
mêlée
quite
unarmed
a
touch
of
age
perhaps
hastings
was
always
an
eccentric
man
in
any
event
as
epilogue
this
neville
congratulated
the
queen
that
by
blind
luck
he
was
forced
to
concede
her
worthy
secretary
had
made
a
prisoner
of
the
scottish
king
doubtless
master
copeland
was
an
estimable
scribe
and
yet
ah
yes
lord
neville
quite
followed
her
majesty
beyond
doubt
the
wardage
of
a
king
was
an
honor
not
lightly
to
be
conferred
oh
yes
he
understood
her
majesty
desired
that
the
office
should
be
given
some
person
of
rank
and
pardie
her
majesty
was
in
the
right
eh
said
the
earl
of
neville
intently
gazing
into
the
man
shallow
eyes
philippa
assented
master
copeland
had
acted
unwarrantably
in
riding
off
with
his
captive
let
him
be
sought
at
once
she
dictated
to
neville
secretary
a
letter
which
informed
john
copeland
that
he
had
done
what
was
not
agreeable
in
purloining
her
prisoner
let
him
without
delay
deliver
the
king
to
her
good
friend
the
earl
of
neville
to
neville
this
was
satisfactory
since
he
intended
that
once
in
his
possession
david
bruce
should
escape
forthwith
the
letter
i
repeat
suited
this
smirking
gentleman
in
its
tiniest
syllable
and
the
single
difficulty
was
to
convey
it
to
john
copeland
for
as
to
his
whereabouts
neither
neville
nor
any
one
else
had
the
least
notion
this
was
immaterial
however
for
they
narrate
that
next
day
a
letter
signed
with
john
copeland
name
was
found
pinned
to
the
front
of
neville
tent
i
cite
a
passage
therefrom
i
will
not
give
up
my
royal
prisoner
to
a
woman
or
a
child
but
only
to
my
own
lord
sire
edward
for
to
him
i
have
sworn
allegiance
and
not
to
any
woman
yet
you
may
tell
the
queen
she
may
depend
on
my
taking
excellent
care
of
king
david
i
have
poulticed
his
nose
as
she
directed
here
was
a
nonplus
not
without
its
comical
side
two
great
realms
had
met
in
battle
and
the
king
of
one
of
them
had
vanished
like
a
philippa
was
in
a
rage
you
could
see
that
both
by
her
demeanor
and
by
the
indignant
letters
she
dictated
true
none
of
these
letters
could
be
delivered
since
they
were
all
addressed
to
john
copeland
meanwhile
scotland
was
in
despair
whereas
the
traitor
english
barons
were
in
a
frenzy
because
they
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
their
fatal
letters
to
the
bruce
or
of
him
either
the
circumstances
were
unique
and
they
remained
unchanged
for
three
feverish
weeks
we
will
now
return
to
affairs
in
france
where
on
the
day
of
the
nativity
as
night
gathered
about
calais
john
copeland
came
unheralded
to
the
quarters
of
king
edward
then
besieging
that
city
master
copeland
entreated
audience
and
got
it
readily
enough
since
there
was
no
man
alive
whom
sire
edward
more
cordially
desired
to
lay
his
fingers
upon
a
page
brought
master
copeland
to
the
king
that
stupendous
blond
and
incredibly
big
person
with
sire
edward
were
that
careful
italian
almerigo
di
pavia
who
afterward
betrayed
sire
edward
and
a
lean
soldier
whom
master
copeland
recognized
as
john
chandos
these
three
were
drawing
up
an
account
of
the
recent
victory
at
créçi
to
be
forwarded
to
all
mayors
and
sheriffs
in
england
with
a
cogent
postscript
as
to
the
king
incidental
and
immediate
need
of
money
now
king
edward
sat
leaning
far
back
in
his
chair
a
hand
on
either
hip
and
with
his
eyes
narrowing
as
he
regarded
master
copeland
had
the
brabanter
flinched
the
king
would
probably
have
hanged
him
within
the
next
ten
minutes
finding
his
gaze
unwavering
the
king
was
pleased
here
was
a
novelty
most
people
blinked
quite
honestly
under
the
scrutiny
of
those
fierce
big
eyes
which
were
blue
and
cold
and
of
an
astounding
lustre
the
lid
of
the
left
eye
drooped
a
little
this
was
count
manuel
legacy
they
whispered
the
king
rose
with
a
jerk
and
took
john
copeland
hand
ha
he
grunted
i
welcome
the
squire
who
by
his
valor
has
captured
the
king
of
scots
and
now
my
man
what
have
you
done
with
davie
john
copeland
answered
highness
you
may
find
him
at
your
convenience
safely
locked
in
bamborough
castle
meanwhile
i
entreat
you
sire
do
not
take
it
amiss
if
i
did
not
surrender
king
david
to
the
orders
of
my
lady
queen
for
i
hold
my
lands
of
you
and
not
of
her
and
my
oath
is
to
you
and
not
to
her
unless
indeed
by
choice
john
the
king
sternly
replied
the
loyal
service
you
have
done
us
is
considerable
whereas
your
excuse
for
kidnapping
davie
is
a
farce
hey
almerigo
do
you
and
chandos
avoid
the
chamber
i
have
something
in
private
with
this
fellow
when
they
had
gone
the
king
sat
down
and
composedly
said
now
tell
me
the
truth
john
copeland
sire
copeland
began
it
is
necessary
you
first
understand
i
bear
a
letter
from
madame
philippa
then
read
it
said
the
king
heart
of
god
have
i
an
eternity
to
waste
on
you
brabanters
john
copeland
read
aloud
while
the
king
trifled
with
a
pen
half
negligent
and
in
part
attendant
read
john
copeland
my
dear
lord
me
to
your
lordship
with
soul
and
body
and
all
my
poor
might
and
with
all
this
i
thank
you
as
my
dear
lord
dearest
and
best
beloved
of
all
earthly
lords
i
protest
to
me
and
thank
you
my
dear
lord
with
all
this
as
i
say
before
your
comfortable
letter
came
to
me
on
saint
gregory
day
and
i
was
never
so
glad
as
when
i
heard
by
your
letter
that
ye
were
strong
enough
in
ponthieu
by
the
grace
of
god
for
to
keep
you
from
your
enemies
among
them
i
estimate
madame
catherine
de
salisbury
who
would
have
betrayed
you
to
the
scot
and
dear
lord
if
it
be
pleasing
to
your
high
lordship
that
as
soon
as
ye
may
that
i
might
hear
of
your
gracious
speed
which
may
god
almighty
continue
and
increase
i
shall
be
glad
and
also
if
ye
do
continue
each
night
to
chafe
your
feet
with
a
rag
of
woollen
stuff
as
your
physician
directed
and
my
dear
lord
if
it
like
you
for
to
know
of
my
fare
john
copeland
will
acquaint
you
concerning
the
bruce
his
capture
and
the
syrup
he
brings
for
our
son
lord
edward
cough
and
the
great
in
these
shires
which
would
have
so
despitefully
wrought
to
you
and
of
the
manner
of
taking
it
after
each
meal
i
am
lately
informed
that
madame
catherine
is
now
at
stirling
with
robert
stewart
and
has
lost
all
her
good
looks
through
a
fever
god
is
invariably
gracious
to
his
servants
farewell
my
dear
lord
and
may
the
holy
trinity
keep
you
from
your
adversaries
and
ever
send
me
comfortable
tidings
of
you
written
at
york
in
the
castle
on
saint
gregory
day
last
past
by
your
own
philippa
to
my
true
lord
h
said
the
king
and
now
give
me
the
entire
story
john
copeland
obeyed
i
must
tell
you
that
early
in
the
narrative
king
edward
arose
and
strode
toward
a
window
catherine
he
said
he
remained
motionless
while
master
copeland
went
on
without
any
manifest
emotion
when
he
had
ended
king
edward
said
and
where
is
madame
de
salisbury
now
at
this
the
brabanter
went
mad
as
a
leopard
springs
he
leaped
upon
the
king
and
grasping
him
by
each
shoulder
shook
that
monarch
as
one
punishing
a
child
now
by
the
splendor
of
god
king
edward
began
very
terrible
in
his
wrath
he
saw
that
john
copeland
held
a
dagger
to
his
breast
and
he
shrugged
well
my
man
you
perceive
i
am
defenceless
first
you
will
hear
me
out
john
copeland
said
it
would
appear
the
king
retorted
that
i
have
little
choice
at
this
time
john
copeland
began
sire
you
are
the
mightiest
monarch
your
race
has
known
england
is
yours
france
is
yours
conquered
scotland
lies
prostrate
at
your
feet
there
is
no
other
man
in
all
the
world
who
possesses
a
tithe
of
your
glory
yet
twenty
years
ago
madame
philippa
first
beheld
you
and
loved
you
an
outcast
an
exiled
prince
twenty
years
ago
the
love
of
madame
philippa
great
count
william
daughter
got
for
you
the
armament
with
which
england
was
regained
twenty
years
ago
but
for
madame
philippa
you
had
died
naked
in
some
ditch
go
on
the
king
said
presently
afterward
you
took
a
fancy
to
reign
in
france
you
learned
then
that
we
brabanters
are
a
frugal
people
madame
philippa
was
wealthy
when
she
married
you
and
twenty
years
had
quadrupled
her
private
fortune
she
gave
you
every
penny
of
it
that
you
might
fit
out
this
expedition
now
her
very
crown
is
in
pawn
at
ghent
in
fine
the
love
of
madame
philippa
gave
you
france
as
lightly
as
one
might
bestow
a
toy
upon
a
child
who
whined
for
it
the
king
fiercely
said
go
on
eh
sire
i
intend
to
you
left
england
undefended
that
you
might
posture
a
little
in
the
eyes
of
europe
and
meanwhile
a
woman
preserves
england
a
woman
gives
you
scotland
as
a
gift
and
in
return
asks
nothing
god
have
mercy
on
us
save
that
you
nightly
chafe
your
feet
with
a
bit
of
woollen
you
hear
of
it
and
inquire
is
madame
de
salisbury
here
beyond
doubt
is
the
cock
of
fable
snarled
john
copeland
who
unearthed
a
gem
and
grumbled
that
his
diamond
was
not
a
grain
of
corn
you
shall
be
hanged
at
dawn
the
king
replied
meanwhile
spit
out
your
venom
i
say
to
you
then
john
copeland
continued
that
you
are
master
of
europe
i
say
to
you
that
but
for
this
woman
whom
for
twenty
years
you
have
neglected
you
would
be
mouldering
in
some
pauper
grave
eh
without
question
you
most
magnanimously
loved
that
shrew
of
salisbury
because
you
fancied
the
color
of
her
eyes
sire
edward
and
admired
the
angle
between
her
nose
and
her
forehead
minstrels
unborn
will
sing
of
this
great
love
of
yours
meantime
i
say
to
you
now
the
man
rage
was
monstrous
i
say
to
you
go
home
to
your
wife
the
source
of
all
your
glory
sit
at
her
feet
and
let
her
teach
you
what
love
is
he
flung
away
the
dagger
there
you
have
the
truth
now
summon
your
attendants
my
très
beau
sire
and
have
me
hanged
the
king
made
no
movement
you
have
been
bold
he
said
at
last
but
you
have
been
far
bolder
sire
for
twenty
years
you
have
dared
to
flout
that
love
which
is
god
noblest
heritage
to
his
children
king
edward
sat
in
meditation
for
a
long
while
the
squinting
of
his
left
eye
was
now
very
noticeable
i
consider
my
wife
clerk
he
drily
said
to
discourse
of
love
in
somewhat
too
much
the
tone
of
a
lover
and
a
flush
was
his
reward
but
when
this
copeland
spoke
he
was
like
one
transfigured
his
voice
was
grave
and
very
tender
and
he
said
as
the
fish
have
their
life
in
the
waters
so
i
have
and
always
shall
have
mine
in
love
love
made
me
choose
and
dare
to
emulate
a
lady
long
ago
through
whom
i
live
contented
without
expecting
any
other
good
her
purity
is
so
inestimable
that
i
can
not
say
whether
i
derive
more
pride
or
sorrow
from
its
preeminence
she
does
not
love
me
and
she
will
never
love
me
she
would
condemn
me
to
be
hewed
in
fragments
sooner
than
permit
her
husband
finger
to
be
injured
yet
she
surpasses
all
others
so
utterly
that
i
would
rather
hunger
in
her
presence
than
enjoy
from
another
all
which
a
lover
can
devise
sire
edward
stroked
the
table
through
this
while
with
an
inverted
pen
he
cleared
his
throat
he
said
now
by
the
face
it
is
not
given
every
man
to
love
precisely
in
this
troubadourish
fashion
even
the
most
generous
person
can
not
render
to
love
any
more
than
that
person
happens
to
possess
i
have
read
in
an
old
tale
how
the
devil
sat
upon
a
cathedral
spire
and
white
doves
flew
about
him
monks
came
and
told
him
to
begone
not
the
spires
show
you
o
son
of
darkness
they
clamored
the
place
is
holy
and
satan
in
this
old
tale
replied
that
these
spires
were
capable
of
various
interpretations
i
speak
of
symbols
john
yet
i
also
have
loved
in
my
own
fashion
and
it
would
seem
i
win
the
same
reward
as
you
the
king
said
more
lately
and
so
she
is
at
stirling
now
hobnob
with
my
armed
enemies
and
cajoling
that
red
lecher
robert
stewart
he
laughed
not
overpleasantly
eh
yes
it
needed
a
bold
person
to
bring
all
your
tidings
but
you
brabanters
are
a
very
people
the
king
rose
and
flung
back
his
high
head
john
the
loyal
service
you
have
done
us
and
our
esteem
for
your
valor
are
so
great
that
they
may
well
serve
you
as
an
excuse
may
shame
fall
on
those
who
bear
you
any
you
will
now
return
home
and
take
your
prisoner
the
king
of
scotland
and
deliver
him
to
my
wife
to
do
with
as
she
may
elect
you
will
convey
to
her
my
entreaty
not
my
orders
john
that
she
come
to
me
here
at
calais
as
remuneration
for
this
insolence
i
assign
lands
as
near
your
house
as
you
can
choose
them
to
the
value
of
a
year
for
you
and
for
your
heirs
you
must
know
that
john
copeland
fell
upon
his
knees
before
king
edward
sire
he
stammered
but
the
king
raised
him
no
no
he
said
you
are
the
better
man
were
there
any
equity
in
fate
john
copeland
your
lady
had
loved
you
not
me
as
it
is
i
must
strive
to
prove
not
altogether
unworthy
of
my
fortune
but
i
make
no
large
promises
he
added
squinting
horribly
because
the
most
generous
person
can
not
render
to
love
any
more
than
that
person
happens
to
possess
so
be
off
with
you
john
copeland
go
my
squire
and
bring
me
back
my
queen
presently
he
heard
john
copeland
singing
without
and
through
that
instant
they
say
his
youth
returned
to
edward
plantagenet
and
all
the
scents
and
shadows
and
faint
sounds
of
valenciennes
on
that
ancient
night
when
a
tall
girl
came
to
him
running
stumbling
in
her
haste
to
bring
him
kingship
she
waddles
now
he
thought
forlornly
still
i
am
blessed
but
copeland
sang
and
the
brabanter
heart
was
big
with
joy
sang
john
copeland
long
i
besought
thee
nor
vainly
daughter
of
water
and
air
charis
idalia
hortensis
hast
thou
not
heard
the
prayer
when
the
blood
stood
still
with
loving
and
the
blood
in
me
leapt
like
wine
and
i
cried
on
thy
name
melaenis
that
heard
me
the
glory
is
thine
and
let
the
heart
of
atys
at
last
at
last
be
mine
falsely
they
tell
of
thy
dying
thou
that
art
older
than
death
and
never
the
hörselberg
hid
thee
whatever
the
slanderer
saith
for
the
stars
are
as
heralds
forerunning
when
laughter
and
love
combine
at
twilight
in
thy
light
melaenis
that
heard
me
the
glory
is
thine
and
let
the
heart
of

anne
magnificently
fetched
from
remote
bohemia
and
at
westminster
married
to
sire
richard
the
second
monarch
of
that
name
to
reign
in
england
this
king
i
must
tell
you
had
succeeded
while
he
was
yet
an
infant
to
the
throne
of
his
grandfather
the
third
king
edward
about
whom
i
have
told
you
in
the
story
preceding
this
queen
anne
had
presently
noted
a
certain
priest
who
went
forbiddingly
about
her
court
where
he
was
accorded
a
provisional
courtesy
and
who
went
also
into
many
hovels
where
pitiable
wrecks
of
humankind
received
his
alms
and
ministrations
queen
anne
made
inquiries
this
young
cleric
was
amanuensis
to
the
duke
of
gloucester
she
learned
and
was
notoriously
a
of
the
duke
brother
dead
lionel
of
clarence
she
sent
for
this
edward
maudelain
when
he
came
her
first
perception
was
how
wonderful
is
his
likeness
to
the
king
while
the
thought
commentary
ran
unacknowledged
yes
as
an
eagle
resembles
a
falcon
for
here
to
the
observant
eye
was
a
more
zealous
person
already
and
a
far
more
dictatorial
and
person
than
the
lazy
and
amiable
king
also
this
maudelain
face
and
nose
were
somewhat
too
long
and
high
the
priest
was
in
a
word
the
less
comely
of
the
pair
by
a
very
little
and
to
an
immeasurable
extent
the
more
kinglike
you
are
my
cousin
now
messire
the
queen
told
him
and
innocently
offered
to
his
lips
her
own
he
never
moved
but
their
glances
crossed
and
for
that
instant
she
saw
the
face
of
a
man
who
has
just
stepped
into
a
quicksand
she
grew
red
without
knowing
why
then
he
spoke
composedly
of
trivial
matters
thus
began
the
queen
acquaintance
with
edward
maudelain
she
was
by
this
time
the
loneliest
woman
in
the
island
her
husband
granted
her
a
bright
and
fresh
perfection
of
form
and
color
but
desiderated
any
appetizing
tang
and
lamented
in
his
phrase
a
certain
kinship
to
the
impeccable
loveliness
of
some
female
saint
in
a
jaunty
tapestry
bright
as
ice
in
sunshine
just
so
her
beauty
chilled
you
he
complained
moreover
this
daughter
of
the
caesars
had
been
fetched
into
england
chiefly
to
breed
him
children
and
this
she
had
never
done
undoubtedly
he
had
made
a
bad
bargain
he
was
too
people
presumed
upon
it
his
barons
snatched
their
cue
and
esteemed
dame
anne
to
be
negligible
whereas
the
clergy
finding
that
she
obstinately
read
the
scriptures
in
the
vulgar
tongue
under
the
irrelevant
plea
of
not
comprehending
latin
began
to
denounce
her
from
their
pulpits
as
a
heretic
and
as
the
evil
woman
prophesied
by
ezekiel
it
was
the
nature
of
this
desolate
child
to
crave
affection
as
a
necessary
and
pitifully
she
tried
to
purchase
it
through
almsgiving
in
the
attempt
she
could
have
found
no
coadjutor
more
ready
than
edward
maudelain
giving
was
with
these
two
a
sort
of
obsession
though
always
he
gave
in
a
half
scorn
of
his
fellow
creatures
which
was
not
more
than
half
concealed
this
bastard
was
charitable
and
pious
because
he
knew
his
soul
conceived
in
double
sin
to
be
doubly
evil
and
therefore
doubly
in
need
of
redemption
through
good
works
now
in
and
about
the
queen
lonely
rooms
the
woman
and
the
priest
met
daily
to
discuss
now
this
or
that
point
of
theology
or
now
to
cite
a
single
instance
gammer
tudway
obstinate
sciatica
considerate
persons
found
something
of
the
pathetic
in
their
preoccupation
by
these
matters
while
so
clamantly
the
dissension
between
the
young
king
and
his
uncles
gathered
to
a
head
the
king
uncles
meant
to
continue
governing
england
with
the
king
as
their
ward
as
long
as
they
could
he
meant
to
relieve
himself
of
this
guardianship
and
them
of
their
heads
as
soon
as
he
was
able
war
seemed
inevitable
the
air
was
thick
with
portents
and
was
this
then
an
appropriate
time
the
judicious
demanded
of
high
heaven
for
the
queen
of
imperilled
england
to
concern
herself
about
a
peasant
toothache
long
afterward
was
edward
maudelain
to
remember
this
quiet
and
amiable
period
of
his
life
and
to
wonder
over
the
man
that
he
had
been
through
this
queer
while
embittered
and
suspicious
she
had
found
him
noted
for
the
carping
tongue
he
lacked
both
power
and
inclination
to
bridle
and
she
had
against
his
nature
made
maudelain
see
that
every
person
is
at
bottom
lovable
and
that
human
vices
are
but
the
stains
of
a
traveller
midway
in
a
dusty
journey
and
had
incited
the
priest
no
longer
to
do
good
for
his
soul
health
but
simply
for
his
fellow
benefit
in
place
of
that
monstrous
passion
which
had
at
first
view
of
her
possessed
the
priest
now
like
a
sheltered
taper
glowed
an
adoration
which
made
him
yearn
in
defiance
of
to
suffer
somehow
for
this
beautiful
and
gracious
comrade
though
very
often
pity
for
her
loneliness
and
knowledge
that
she
dared
trust
no
one
save
him
would
throttle
maudelain
like
two
assassins
and
would
move
the
young
man
to
a
rapture
of
and
exultation
now
maudelain
made
excellent
songs
it
was
a
matter
of
common
report
yet
but
once
in
their
close
friendship
did
the
queen
command
him
to
make
a
song
for
her
this
had
been
at
dover
about
vespers
in
the
starved
and
tiny
garden
overlooking
the
english
channel
upon
which
her
apartments
faced
and
the
priest
had
fingered
his
lute
for
an
appreciable
while
before
he
sang
more
harshly
than
was
his
custom
sang
maudelain
ave
maria
now
cry
we
so
that
see
night
wake
and
daylight
go
mother
and
maid
in
nothing
incomplete
this
night

more
light
and
fleet
than
twilight
trod

stumbling
feet

had
risen
she
said
nothing
she
stayed
in
this
posture
for
a
lengthy
while
one
hand
yet
clasping
each
breast
then
she
laughed
and
began
to
speak
of
long
simon
recent
fever
was
there
no
method
of
establishing
him
in
another
cottage
no
the
priest
said
the
peasants
like
the
cattle
were
always
deeded
with
the
land
and
simon
could
not
lawfully
be
taken
away
from
his
owner
one
day
about
the
hour
of
prime
in
that
season
of
the
year
when
fields
smell
of
young
grass
the
duke
of
gloucester
sent
for
edward
maudelain
the
court
was
then
at
windsor
the
priest
came
quickly
to
his
patron
he
found
the
duke
in
company
with
the
king
other
uncle
edmund
of
york
and
bland
harry
of
derby
who
was
john
of
oldest
son
and
in
consequence
the
king
cousin
each
was
a
proud
and
handsome
man
derby
alone
who
was
afterward
king
of
england
had
inherited
the
squint
that
distinguished
this
family
gloucester
was
gnawing
at
his
finger
nails
big
york
seemed
and
the
earl
of
derby
appeared
patiently
to
await
something
as
yet
ineffably
remote
sit
down
snarled
gloucester
his
lean
and
evil
countenance
was
that
of
a
tired
devil
the
priest
obeyed
wondering
that
so
high
an
honor
should
be
accorded
him
in
the
view
of
three
great
noblemen
then
gloucester
said
in
his
sharp
way
edward
you
know
as
england
knows
the
king
intention
toward
us
three
and
our
adherents
it
has
come
to
our
demolishment
or
his
i
confess
a
preference
in
the
matter
i
have
consulted
with
the
pope
concerning
the
advisability
of
taking
the
crown
into
my
own
hands
edmund
here
does
not
want
it
and
my
brother
john
is
already
achieving
one
in
spain
eh
in
imagination
i
was
already
king
of
england
and
i
had
dreamed
well
the
prosaic
courier
arrived
urban
the
neapolitan
swine
dares
give
me
no
assistance
it
is
decreed
i
shall
never
reign
in
these
islands
and
i
had
dreamed
meanwhile
de
vere
and
de
la
pole
are
at
the
king
day
and
night
urging
revolt
as
matters
go
within
a
week
or
two
the
three
heads
before
you
will
be
embellishing
temple
bar
you
of
course
they
will
only
hang
we
must
avoid
england
then
my
noble
patron
the
priest
considered
angrily
the
duke
struck
a
clenched
fist
upon
the
table
by
the
cross
we
remain
in
england
you
and
i
and
all
of
us
others
avoid
the
pope
and
the
emperor
will
have
none
of
me
they
plead
for
the
black
prince
heir
for
the
legitimate
heir
dompnedex
they
shall
have
him
maudelain
recoiled
for
he
thought
this
twitching
man
insane
besides
the
king
intends
to
take
from
me
my
fief
at
sudbury
said
the
duke
of
york
in
order
to
give
it
to
de
vere
that
is
both
absurd
and
monstrous
and
abominable
openly
gloucester
sneered
listen
he
rapped
out
toward
maudelain
when
they
were
drawing
up
the
great
peace
at
brétigny
it
happened
as
is
notorious
that
the
black
prince
my
brother
wooed
in
this
town
the
demoiselle
alixe
riczi
whom
in
the
outcome
he
abducted
it
is
not
so
generally
known
however
that
finding
this
sister
of
the
vicomte
de
montbrison
a
girl
of
obdurate
virtue
my
brother
had
prefaced
the
action
by
marriage
and
what
have
i
to
do
with
all
this
said
edward
maudelain
gloucester
retorted
more
than
you
think
for
this
alixe
was
conveyed
to
chertsey
here
in
england
where
at
the
year
end
she
died
in
childbirth
a
little
before
this
time
had
sir
thomas
holland
seen
his
last
day
the
husband
of
that
joane
of
kent
whom
throughout
life
my
brother
loved
most
marvellously
the
disposition
of
the
late
is
tolerably
well
known
i
make
no
comment
save
that
to
her
moulding
my
brother
was
as
so
much
wax
in
fine
the
two
lovers
were
presently
married
and
their
son
reigns
in
england
the
abandoned
son
of
alixe
riczi
was
reared
by
the
cistercians
at
chertsey
where
some
years
ago
i
found
you
he
spoke
with
a
stifled
voice
wrenching
forth
each
sentence
and
now
with
a
stiff
forefinger
flipped
a
paper
across
the
table
my
brother
did
more
than
confess
he
signed
your
majesty
said
gloucester
the
duke
on
a
sudden
flung
out
his
hands
like
a
wizard
whose
necromancy
fails
and
the
palms
were
bloodied
where
his
nails
had
cut
the
flesh
moreover
my
daughter
was
born
at
sudbury
said
the
duke
of
york
and
of
maudelain
face
i
can
not
tell
you
he
made
pretence
to
read
the
paper
carefully
but
his
eyes
roved
and
he
knew
that
he
stood
among
wolves
the
room
was
oddly
shaped
with
eight
equal
sides
the
ceiling
was
of
a
light
and
brilliant
blue
powdered
with
many
golden
stars
and
the
walls
were
hung
with
smart
tapestries
which
commemorated
the
exploits
of
theseus
then
i
am
king
this
maudelain
said
aloud
of
france
and
england
and
lord
of
ireland
and
duke
of
aquitaine
i
perceive
that
heaven
loves
a
jest
he
wheeled
upon
gloucester
and
spoke
with
singular
irrelevance
and
what
is
to
be
done
with
the
present
queen
again
the
duke
shrugged
i
had
not
thought
of
the
dumb
wench
we
have
many
convents
now
maudelain
twisted
the
paper
between
his
long
wet
fingers
and
appeared
to
meditate
it
would
be
advisable
your
grace
observed
the
earl
of
derby
suavely
and
breaking
his
silence
for
the
first
time
that
you
yourself
should
wed
dame
anne
once
the
apostolic
see
has
granted
the
necessary
dispensation
treading
too
close
upon
the
fighting
requisite
to
bring
about
the
dethronement
and
death
of
our
nominal
lord
the
king
a
war
with
bohemia
which
would
be
only
too
apt
to
follow
this
noble
lady
assassination
would
be
highly
inconvenient
and
lacking
that
we
would
have
to
pay
back
her
dowry
then
these
three
princes
rose
and
knelt
before
the
priest
they
were
clad
in
long
bright
garments
and
they
glittered
with
gold
and
many
jewels
he
standing
among
them
shuddered
in
his
sombre
robe
hail
king
of
england
cried
these
three
hail
ye
that
are
my
kinsmen
he
answered
hail
ye
that
spring
of
an
accursed
race
as
i
and
woe
to
england
for
that
hour
wherein
manuel
of
poictesme
held
traffic
with
the
sorceress
of
provence
and
the
devil
son
begot
an
heir
for
england
of
ice
and
of
lust
and
of
are
all
we
sprung
old
records
attest
it
and
fickle
and
cold
and
ravenous
and
without
shame
are
all
our
race
until
the
end
of
your
brother
dishonor
ye
make
merchandise
and
fratricide
whispers
me
and
leers
and
heaven
help
me
i
attend
o
god
of
gods
wilt
thou
dare
bid
a
man
live
stainless
having
aforetime
filled
his
veins
with
such
a
venom
then
haro
will
i
cry
from
thy
deepest
hell
oh
now
let
the
adulterous
redeemer
of
poictesme
rejoice
in
his
tall
fires
to
note
that
his
descendants
know
of
what
wood
to
make
a
crutch
you
are
very
wise
my
kinsmen
take
your
measures
messieurs
who
are
my
kinsmen
though
were
i
of
any
other
race
with
what
expedition
would
i
now
kill
you
i
that
recognize
within
me
the
strength
to
do
it
then
would
i
slay
you
without
any
animosity
would
i
slay
you
then
just
as
i
would
kill
as
many
splendid
snakes
he
went
away
laughing
horribly
gloucester
drummed
upon
the
table
his
brows
contracted
but
the
lean
duke
said
nothing
big
york
seemed
to
drowse
and
henry
of
derby
smiled
as
he
sounded
a
gong
for
that
scribe
who
would
draw
up
the
necessary
letters
the
earl
time
was
not
yet
come
but
it
was
nearing
in
the
antechamber
the
priest
encountered
two
dragging
a
dead
body
from
the
castle
the
duke
of
kent
maudelain
was
informed
had
taken
a
fancy
to
a
peasant
girl
and
in
remonstrance
her
misguided
father
had
actually
tugged
at
his
grace
sleeve
maudelain
went
into
the
park
of
windsor
where
he
walked
for
a
long
while
alone
it
was
a
fine
day
in
the
middle
spring
and
now
he
seemed
to
understand
for
the
first
time
how
fair
was
his
england
for
all
england
was
his
fief
held
in
vassalage
to
god
and
to
no
man
alive
his
heart
now
sang
allwhither
his
empire
spread
opulent
in
grain
and
metal
and
every
revenue
of
the
earth
and
in
stalwart
men
his
chattels
and
in
strong
orderly
cities
where
the
windows
would
be
adorned
with
scarlet
hangings
and
women
with
golden
hair
and
red
lax
lips
would
presently
admire
as
king
edward
rode
slowly
by
at
the
head
of
a
resplendent
retinue
and
always
the
king
would
bow
graciously
and
without
haste
to
his
shouting
people
he
laughed
to
find
himself
already
at
rehearsal
of
the
gesture
it
was
strange
though
that
in
this
glorious
fief
of
his
so
many
persons
should
as
yet
live
day
by
day
as
cattle
live
suspicious
of
all
other
moving
things
with
reason
and
roused
from
their
incurious
and
filthy
apathy
only
when
some
glittering
baron
like
a
resistless
eagle
swept
uncomfortably
near
as
he
passed
on
some
of
the
more
bright
and
windy
east
and
north
they
had
gone
yearly
for
so
many
centuries
these
dumb
peasants
to
fight
out
their
master
uncomprehended
quarrel
and
to
manure
with
their
carcasses
the
soil
of
france
and
of
scotland
give
these
serfs
a
king
now
who
being
absolute
might
dare
to
deal
in
perfect
equity
with
rich
and
poor
who
with
his
advent
would
bring
peace
into
england
as
his
bride
as
trygaeus
did
very
anciently
in
athens
and
then
the
priest
paraphrased
may
england
recover
all
the
blessings
she
has
lost
and
everywhere
the
glitter
of
active
steel
will
cease
for
everywhere
men
would
crack
a
rustic
jest
or
two
unhurriedly
virid
fields
would
heave
brownly
under
their
ploughs
they
would
find
that
with
practice
it
was
almost
as
easy
to
chuckle
as
it
was
to
cringe
meanwhile
on
every
side
the
nobles
tyrannized
in
their
degree
well
clothed
and
nourished
but
at
bottom
equally
comfortless
in
condition
as
illuminate
by
lightning
maudelain
saw
the
many
factions
of
his
barons
squabbling
for
gross
pleasures
like
wolves
over
a
corpse
and
blindly
dealing
death
to
one
another
to
secure
at
least
one
more
delicious
gulp
before
that
inevitable
mangling
by
the
teeth
of
some
burlier
colleague
the
complete
misery
of
england
showed
before
maudelain
like
a
winter
landscape
the
thing
was
questionless
he
must
tread
henceforward
without
fear
among
frenzied
beasts
and
to
their
ultimate
welfare
on
a
sudden
maudelain
knew
himself
to
be
invincible
and
fine
and
hesitancy
ebbed
true
richard
poor
fool
must
die
squarely
the
priest
faced
that
stark
and
hideous
circumstance
to
spare
richard
was
beyond
his
power
and
the
boy
was
his
brother
yes
this
oncoming
king
edward
would
be
a
fratricide
and
after
death
would
be
irrevocably
damned
to
burn
and
eternally
to
burn
and
worst
of
all
to
know
that
the
torment
was
eternal
ay
it
would
be
hard
but
at
the
cost
of
richard
ignoble
life
and
of
edward
inconsiderable
soul
to
win
so
many
men
to
manhood
was
not
a
bargain
to
be
refused
the
tale
tells
that
maudelain
went
toward
the
little
garden
which
adjoined
dame
anne
apartments
he
found
the
queen
there
alone
as
nowadays
she
was
for
the
most
part
and
he
paused
to
wonder
at
her
bright
and
singular
beauty
how
vaguely
odd
was
this
beauty
he
reflected
too
how
alien
in
its
effect
to
that
of
any
other
woman
in
sturdy
england
and
how
associable
it
was
somehow
with
every
wild
and
gracious
denizen
of
the
woods
which
blossomed
yonder
in
this
place
the
world
was
all
sunlight
temperate
but
undiluted
they
had
met
in
a
wide
unshaded
plot
of
grass
too
short
to
ripple
which
everywhere
glowed
steadily
like
a
gem
right
and
left
birds
sang
as
if
in
a
contest
the
sky
was
cloudless
a
faint
and
radiant
blue
throughout
save
where
the
sun
stayed
as
yet
in
the
zenith
so
that
the
queen
brows
cast
shadows
upon
either
cheek
the
priest
was
greatly
troubled
by
the
proud
and
heatless
brilliancies
the
shrill
joys
of
every
object
within
the
radius
of
his
senses
she
was
splendidly
clothed
in
a
kirtle
of
very
bright
green
tinted
like
the
verdancy
of
young
ferns
in
sunlight
and
wore
over
all
a
gown
of
white
cut
open
on
each
side
as
far
as
the
hips
this
garment
was
embroidered
with
golden
leopards
and
was
trimmed
with
ermine
about
her
yellow
hair
was
a
chaplet
of
gold
wherein
emeralds
glowed
her
blue
eyes
were
as
large
and
shining
and
changeable
he
thought
as
two
oceans
in
midsummer
and
maudelain
stood
motionless
and
seemed
to
himself
but
to
revere
as
the
earl
ixion
did
some
bright
unstable
wisp
of
cloud
while
somehow
all
elation
departed
from
him
as
water
does
from
a
wetted
sponge
compressed
he
laughed
discordantly
wait
o
my
only
friend
said
maudelain
then
in
a
level
voice
he
told
her
all
unhurriedly
and
without
any
apparent
emotion
she
had
breathed
once
with
a
deep
inhalation
she
had
screened
her
countenance
from
his
gaze
the
while
you
might
have
counted
fifty
presently
she
said
this
means
more
war
for
de
vere
and
tressilian
and
de
la
pole
and
bramber
and
others
of
the
barons
know
that
the
king
fall
signifies
their
ruin
many
thousands
die
he
answered
it
means
a
war
which
will
make
me
king
of
england
and
will
make
you
my
wife
in
that
war
the
nobles
will
ride
abroad
with
banners
and
gay
surcoats
and
will
kill
and
ravish
in
the
pauses
of
their
songs
while
daily
in
that
war
the
naked
peasants
will
kill
the
one
the
other
without
knowing
why
his
thought
had
forerun
hers
yes
some
must
die
so
that
in
the
end
i
may
be
king
and
the
general
happiness
may
rest
at
my
disposal
the
adventure
of
this
world
is
wonderful
and
it
goes
otherwise
than
under
the
strict
tutelage
of
reason
it
would
not
be
yours
but
gloucester
and
his
barons
friend
they
would
set
you
on
the
throne
to
be
their
puppet
and
to
move
only
as
they
pulled
the
strings
thwart
them
in
their
maraudings
and
they
will
fling
you
aside
as
the
barons
have
pulled
down
every
king
that
dared
oppose
them
no
they
desire
to
live
pleasantly
to
have
fish
on
fridays
and
white
bread
and
the
finest
wine
the
whole
year
through
and
there
is
not
enough
for
all
say
they
can
you
alone
contend
against
them
and
conquer
them
for
not
unless
you
can
do
this
may
i
dare
bid
you
reign
the
sun
had
grown
too
bright
too
merciless
but
as
always
she
drew
the
truth
from
him
i
could
not
venture
to
oppose
in
anything
the
barons
who
supported
my
cause
for
if
i
did
i
would
not
endure
a
fortnight
heaven
help
us
nor
you
nor
i
nor
any
one
may
transform
through
any
personal
force
this
bitter
world
this
piercing
cruel
place
of
frost
and
sun
charity
and
truth
are
excommunicate
and
a
king
is
only
an
adorned
and
fearful
person
who
leads
wolves
toward
their
quarry
lest
lacking
it
they
turn
and
devour
him
everywhere
the
powerful
labor
to
put
one
another
out
of
worship
and
each
to
stand
the
higher
with
the
other
corpse
as
his
pedestal
and
lechery
and
greed
and
hatred
sway
these
proud
and
inconsiderate
fools
as
winds
blow
at
will
the
gay
leaves
of
autumn
we
walk
among
shining
vapors
we
aspire
to
overpass
a
mountain
of
unstable
sparkling
sand
we
two
alone
in
all
the
scuffling
world
oh
it
is
horrible
and
i
think
that
satan
plans
the
jest
we
dream
for
a
while
of
refashioning
this
bright
desolation
and
know
that
we
alone
can
do
it
we
are
as
demigods
you
and
i
in
those
gallant
dreams
and
at
the
end
we
can
but
poultice
some
dirty
rascal
the
queen
answered
sadly
once
and
only
once
did
god
tread
this
tangible
world
for
a
very
little
while
and
look
you
to
what
trivial
matters
he
devoted
that
brief
space
only
to
chat
with
fishermen
and
to
talk
with
light
women
and
to
consort
with
rascals
and
at
last
to
die
between
two
cutpurses
ignominiously
if
christ
himself
achieved
so
little
that
seemed
great
and
admirable
how
should
we
two
hope
to
do
any
more
he
answered
it
is
true
of
anise
and
of
cumin
the
master
gets
his
tithe
maudelain
broke
off
with
a
yapping
laugh
puf
heaven
is
wiser
than
we
i
am
king
of
england
it
is
my
heritage
it
means
war
many
will
die
thousands
will
die
and
to
no
betterment
of
affairs
i
am
king
of
england
i
am
heaven
satrap
here
and
answerable
to
heaven
alone
it
is
my
heritage
and
now
his
large
and
cruel
eyes
were
aflame
as
he
regarded
her
and
visibly
beneath
their
glare
the
woman
changed
my
friend
must
i
not
love
you
any
longer
you
would
be
content
with
happiness
then
i
am
jealous
of
that
happiness
for
you
are
the
one
friend
that
i
have
had
and
so
dear
to
me
look
you
she
said
with
a
light
wistful
laugh
there
have
been
times
when
i
was
afraid
of
everything
you
touched
and
i
hated
everything
you
looked
at
i
would
not
have
you
stained
i
desired
to
pass
my
whole
life
between
the
four
walls
of
some
dingy
and
eternal
gaol
forever
alone
with
you
lest
you
become
like
other
men
i
would
in
that
period
have
been
the
very
bread
you
eat
the
least
perfume
which
delights
you
the
clod
you
touch
in
crushing
it
and
i
have
often
loathed
some
pleasure
i
derived
from
life
because
i
might
not
transfer
it
to
you
undiminished
for
i
wanted
somehow
to
make
you
happy
to
my
own
anguish
it
was
wicked
i
suppose
for
the
imagining
of
it
made
me
happy
too
now
while
he
listened
to
this
dear
and
tranquil
speaking
edward
maudelain
raised
hands
had
fallen
like
so
much
lead
and
remembering
his
own
nature
he
longed
for
annihilation
before
she
had
appraised
his
vileness
he
said
with
reason
augustine
crieth
out
against
the
lust
of
the
eyes
pleasure
seeketh
objects
beautiful
melodious
fragrant
savory
and
soft
but
this
disease
those
contrary
as
well
not
for
the
sake
of
suffering
annoyance
but
out
of
the
lust
of
making
trial
of
them
ah
ah
too
curiously
i
planned
my
own
damnation
too
presumptuously
i
had
esteemed
my
soul
a
worthy
scapegoat
and
i
had
gilded
my
enormity
with
many
lies
yet
indeed
indeed
i
had
believed
brave
things
i
had
planned
a
not
ignoble
bargain
ey
say
is
it
not
laughable
madame
as
my
heaven
accords
me
a
penny
and
with
that
only
penny
i
must
presently
be
seeking
to
bribe
heaven
then
he
said
yet
are
we
indeed
god
satraps
as
but
now
i
cried
in
my
vainglory
and
we
hold
within
our
palms
the
destiny
of
many
peoples
depardieux
god
is
wiser
than
we
are
still
satan
offers
no
unhandsome
bribes
bribes
that
are
tangible
and
sure
for
satan
too
is
wiser
than
we
are
they
stood
like
effigies
lit
by
the
broad
unsparing
splendor
of
the
morning
but
again
their
kindling
eyes
had
met
and
again
the
man
shuddered
decide
oh
decide
very
quickly
my
only
friend
he
said
for
throughout
i
am
all
filth
closer
she
drew
to
him
and
laid
one
hand
upon
each
shoulder
o
my
only
friend
she
breathed
with
red
lax
lips
which
were
very
near
to
his
through
these
six
years
i
have
ranked
your
friendship
as
the
chief
of
all
my
honors
and
i
pray
god
with
an
entire
heart
that
i
may
die
so
soon
as
i
have
done
what
i
must
do
now
maudelain
was
trying
to
smile
but
he
could
not
quite
manage
it
god
save
king
richard
said
the
priest
for
by
the
cowardice
and
greed
and
ignorance
of
little
men
is
salomon
himself
confounded
and
by
them
is
hercules
lightly
unhorsed
were
i
leviathan
whose
bones
were
long
ago
picked
clean
by
pismires
i
could
perform
nothing
against
the
will
of
many
human
pismires
therefore
do
you
pronounce
my
doom
o
king
then
said
dame
anne
i
bid
you
go
forever
from
the
court
and
live
forever
a
landless
man
friendless
and
without
even
any
name
otherwise
you
can
in
no
way
escape
being
made
an
instrument
to
bring
about
the
misery
and
death
of
many
thousands
this
doom
i
dare
adjudge
and
to
pronounce
because
we
are
royal
and
god
satraps
you
and
i
twice
or
thrice
his
dry
lips
moved
before
he
spoke
he
was
aware
of
innumerable
birds
that
carolled
with
a
piercing
and
intolerable
sweetness
o
queen
he
hoarsely
said
o
fellow
satrap
heaven
has
many
fiefs
a
fair
province
is
wasted
and
accords
to
heaven
no
revenue
so
wastes
beauty
and
a
shrewd
wit
and
an
illimitable
charity
which
of
their
pride
go
in
fetters
and
achieve
no
increase
the
young
king
junkets
with
his
flatterers
and
but
rarely
thinks
of
england
you
have
that
beauty
by
which
men
are
lightly
conquered
and
the
mere
sight
of
which
may
well
cause
a
man
voice
to
tremble
as
my
voice
trembles
now
and
through
desire
of
which
but
i
tread
afield
of
that
beauty
you
have
made
no
profit
o
daughter
of
the
caesars
i
bid
you
now
gird
either
loin
for
an
unlovely
traffic
old
legion
must
be
fought
with
fire
true
that
the
age
is
sick
true
that
we
may
not
cure
we
can
but
salve
the
hurt
his
hand
had
torn
open
his
sombre
gown
and
the
man
bared
breast
shone
in
the
sunlight
and
on
his
breast
heaved
sleek
and
glittering
beads
of
sweat
twice
he
cried
the
queen
name
in
a
while
he
said
i
bid
you
weave
incessantly
such
snares
of
brain
and
body
as
may
lure
king
richard
to
be
swayed
by
you
until
against
his
will
you
daily
guide
this
fool
to
some
commendable
action
i
bid
you
live
as
other
folk
do
hereabouts
coax
beg
cheat
wheedle
lie
he
barked
like
a
teased
dog
and
play
the
prostitute
for
him
that
wears
my
crown
till
you
achieve
in
part
the
task
which
is
denied
me
this
doom
i
dare
adjudge
and
to
pronounce
because
we
are
royal
and
satraps
you
and
i
she
answered
with
a
tiny
wordless
sound
but
presently
i
take
my
doom
the
queen
proudly
said
i
shall
be
lonely
now
my
only
friend
and
yet
it
does
not
matter
the
queen
said
with
a
little
shiver
no
nothing
will
ever
greatly
matter
now
i
think
now
that
i
may
not
ever
see
you
any
more
my
dearest
her
eyes
had
filled
with
tears
she
was
unhappy
and
as
always
this
knowledge
roused
in
maudelain
a
sort
of
frenzied
pity
and
a
hatred
quite
illogical
of
all
other
things
existent
she
was
unhappy
that
only
he
comprehended
and
for
her
to
be
made
unhappy
was
unjust
so
he
stood
thus
for
an
appreciable
silence
staying
motionless
save
that
behind
his
back
his
fingers
were
bruising
one
another
everywhere
was
this
or
that
bright
color
and
an
incessant
melody
it
was
unbearable
then
it
was
over
the
ordered
progress
of
all
happenings
was
apparent
simple
and
natural
and
contentment
came
into
his
heart
like
a
flight
of
linnets
over
level
fields
at
dawn
he
left
her
and
as
he
went
he
sang
sang
maudelain
christ
save
us
all
as
well
he
can
a
solis
ortus
cardine
for
he
is
both
god
and
man
qui
natus
est
de
virgine
and
we
but
part
of
his
wide
plan
that
sing
and
heartily
sing
we
tibi
domine
between
a
heifer
and
an
ass
enixa
est
puerpera
in
ragged
woollen
clad
he
was
qui
régnât
super
aethera
and
patiently
may
we
then
pass
that
sing
and
heartily
sing
we
tibi
domine
the
queen
shivered
in
the
glad
sunlight
i
am
it
must
be
pitiably
weak
she
said
at
last
because
i
can
not
sing
as
he
does
and
since
i
am
not
very
wise
were
he
to
return
even
now
but
he
will
not
return
he
will
never
return
the
queen
repeated
carefully
it
is
strange
i
can
not
comprehend
that
he
will
never
return
ah
mother
of
god
she
cried
with
a
steadier
voice
grant
that
i
may
weep
nay
of
thy
infinite
mercy
let
me
presently
find
the
heart
to
weep
and
about
the
queen
of
england
many
birds
sang
joyously
she
sent
for
the
king
that
evening
after
supper
and
they
may
well
have
talked
of
many
matters
for
he
did
not
return
to
his
own
apartments
that
night
next
day
the
english
barons
held
a
council
and
in
the
midst
of
it
king
richard
demanded
to
be
told
his
age
your
grace
is
in
your
year
said
the
uneasy
gloucester
who
was
now
with
reason
troubled
since
he
had
been
vainly
seeking
everywhere
for
the
evanished
maudelain
then
i
have
been
under
tutors
and
governors
longer
than
any
other
ward
in
my
dominion
my
lords
i
thank
you
for
your
past
services
but
i
need
them
no
more
they
had
no
check
handy
and
gloucester
in
particular
foreread
his
but
of
necessity
he
shouted
with
the
others
hail
king
of
england
that
afternoon
the
king
assumption
of
all
royal
responsibility
was
commemorated
by
a
tournament
over
which
dame
anne
presided
sixty
of
her
ladies
led
as
many
knights
by
silver
chains
into
the
at
smithfield
and
it
was
remarked
that
the
queen
appeared
unusually
mirthful
the
king
was
in
high
good
humor
a
pattern
of
conjugal
devotion
and
the
royal
pair
retired
at
dusk
to
the
bishop

was
held

a

hermit
notoriously

neighboring

revered
as
the
blessed
evrawc
there
had
been
a
time
when
people
called

he
dared
not
often

in

the

fasting

in
prayers
he
spent

this

troubled

devils
he
got
little
rest
because
of
them
sometimes
would
come
into
his
hut
belphegor
in
the
likeness
of
a
butler
and
whisper
sire
had
you
been
king
as
was
your
right
you
had
drunk
not
water
but
the
wines
of
spain
and
hungary
or
asmodeus
saying
sire
had
you
been
king
as
was
your
right
you
had
lain
now
not
upon
the
bare
earth
but
on
cushions
of
silk
one
day
in
early
spring
they
say
the
spirit
called
orvendile
sent
the
likeness
of
a
fair
woman
with
yellow
hair
and
large
blue
eyes
she
wore
a
massive
crown
which
seemed
too
heavy
for
her
frailness
to
sustain
soft
tranquil
eyes
had
lifted
from
her
book
you
are
my
cousin
now
messire
this
phantom
had
appeared
to
say
that
was
the
worst
and
maudelain
began
to
fear
he
was
a
little
mad
because
even
this
he
had
resisted
with
many
aves
there
came
also
to
his
hut
through
a
sullen
snowstorm
upon
the
afternoon
of
all
soul
day
a
horseman
in
a
long
cloak
of
black
he
tethered
his
black
horse
and
he
came
noiselessly
through
the
doorway
of
the
hut
and
upon
his
breast
and
shoulders
the
snow
was
white
as
the
bleached
bones
of
those
women
that
died
in
merlin
youth
greetings
in
god
name
messire
edward
maudelain
the
stranger
said
since
the
spoke
intrepidly
of
holy
things
a
cheerier
maudelain
knew
that
this
at
least
was
no
demon
greetings
he
answered
but
i
am
evrawc
you
name
a
man
long
dead
but
it
is
from
a
certain
bohemian
woman
i
come
what
matter
then
if
the
dead
receive
me
and
thus
speaking
the
stranger
dropped
his
cloak
he
was
clad
as
you
now
saw
in
satin
which
shimmered
with
each
movement
like
a
high
flame
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
tall
lean
youngster
with
crisp
curling
very
dark
red
hair
he
now
regarded
maudelain
he
displayed
peculiarly
brown
eyes
and
their
gaze
was
tender
and
the
tears
somehow
had
come
to
eyes
because
of
his
great
love
for
this
tall
stranger
eh
from
the
dead
to
the
dead
i
travel
as
ever
said
the
with
a
message
and
a
token
my
message
runs
is
o
fellow
satrap
and
my
token
is
this
in
this
packet
wrapped
with
white
parchment
and
tied
with
a
golden
cord
was
only
a
lock
of
hair
it
lay
like
a
little
yellow
serpent
in
maudelain
palm
and
yet
five
years
ago
he
mused
this
hair
was
turned
to
dust
god
keep
us
all
then
he
saw
the
tall
lean
emissary
puffed
out
like
a
and
upon
the
floor
he
saw
the
huddled
cloak
waver
and
spread
like
ink
and
he
saw
the
white
parchment
slowly
dwindle
as
snow
melts
under
the
open
sun
but
in
his
hand
remained
the
lock
of
yellow
hair
o
my
only
friend
said
maudelain
i
may
not
comprehend
but
i
know
that
by
no
unhallowed
art
have
you
won
back
to
me
hair
by
hair
he
scattered
upon
the
floor
that
which
he
held
is
and
i
have
not
need
of
any
token
to
spur
my
memory
he
prized
up
a
corner
of
the
hearthstone
took
out
a
small
leather
bag
and
that
day
purchased
a
horse
and
a
sword
at
dawn
the
blessed
evrawc
rode
eastward
in
secular
apparel
two
weeks
later
he
came
to
sunninghill
and
it
happened
that
the
same
morning
the
earl
of
salisbury
who
had
excellent
reason
to
consider
a
lacuna
of
fourteen
pages
maudelain
successful
imposture
of
his
richard
the
second
so
strangely
favored
by
their
physical
resemblance
and
the
subsequent
fiasco
at
circencester
are
now
however
tolerably
well
known
to
students
of
one
way
or
another
maudelain
contrived
to
take
the
place
of
his
now
dethroned
brother
and
therewith
also
the
punishment
designed
for
richard
it
would
seem
evident
from
the
argument
of
the
story
in
hand
that
nicolas
de
caen
attributes
a
large
part
of
this
mysterious
business
to
the
of
isabel
of
valois
king
richard
eleven
year
old
wife
and
should
one
have
a
taste
for
the
deductive
the
foregoing
name
of
orvendile
when
compared
with
the
story
of
the
scabbard
would
certainly
hint
that
owain
glyndwyr
had
a
finger
in
the
is
impossible
to
divine
by
what
method
according
to
nicolas
this
edward
maudelain
was
substituted
for
his
younger
brother
nicolas
if
you
are
to
believe
his
epilogue
had
the
best
of
reasons
for
knowing
that
the
prisoner
locked
up
in
pontefract
castle
in
the
february
of
after
harry
of
derby
had
seized
the
crown
of
england
was
not
richard
plantagenet
as
is
attested
also
by
the
remaining
fragment
of
this
story
of
the
heritage
and
eight
followed
him
quickly
maudelain
rose
from
the
table
pushing
his
tall
chair
aside
and
as
he
did
this
one
of
the
soldiers
closed
the
door
securely
nay
eat
your
fill
sire
richard
said
piers
exton
since
you
will
not
ever
eat
again
is
it
so
the
trapped
man
answered
quietly
then
indeed
you
come
in
a
good
hour
once
only
he
smote
upon
his
breast
culpa
o
eternal
father
do
thou
shrive
me
very
quickly
of
all
those
sins
i
have
committed
both
in
thought
and
deed
for
now
the
time
is
very
short
and
exton
spat
upon
the
dusty
floor
foh
they
had
told
me
i
would
find
a
king
here
i
discover
only
a
cat
that
whines
then
his
claws
as
a
viper
leaps
maudelain
sprang
upon
the
nearest
fellow
and
wrested
away
his
halberd
then
his
claws
my
men
for
i
come
of
an
accursed
race
and
now
let
some
of
you
lament
that
hour
wherein
the
devil
son
begot
an
heir
for
england
for
of
ice
and
of
lust
and
of
are
all
we
sprung
old
records
attest
it
and
fickle
and
cold
and
ravenous
and
without
fear
are
all
our
race
until
the
end
hah
until
the
end
o
god
of
gods
this
maudelain
cried
with
a
great
voice
wilt
thou
dare
bid
a
man
die
patiently
having
aforetime
filled
his
veins
with
such
a
venom
for
i
lack
the
grace
to
die
as
all
thy
saints
have
died
without
one
carnal
blow
struck
in
my
own
defence
i
lack
the
grace
my
father
for
even
at
the
last
the
devil
blood
you
gave
me
is
not
quelled
i
dare
atone
for
that
old
sin
done
by
my
father
in
the
flesh
but
yet
i
must
atone
as
befits
the
race
of
oriander
then
it
was
he
and
not
they
who
pressed
to
the
attack
their
meeting
was
a
bloody
business
for
in
that
dark
and
crowded
room
maudelain
raged
among
his
nine
antagonists
like
an
angered
lion
among
wolves
they
struck
at
random
and
cursed
shrilly
for
they
were
now
of
this
prey
they
had
entrapped
so
that
presently
he
was
all
hacked
and
bleeding
though
as
yet
he
had
no
mortal
wound
four
of
these
men
he
had
killed
by
this
time
and
piers
exton
also
lay
at
his
feet
then
the
other
four
drew
back
a
little
are
ye
tired
so
soon
said
maudelain
and
he
laughed
terribly
what
even
you
why
look
ye
my
bold
veterans
i
never
killed
before
and
i
am
not
breathed
as
yet
thus
he
boasted
exultant
in
his
strength
but
the
other
men
saw
that
behind
him
piers
exton
had
crawled
into
the
chair
from
which
they
thought
king
richard
had
just
risen
and
they
saw
exton
standing
erect
in
this
chair
with
both
arms
raised
they
saw
this
exton
strike
the
king
with
his
from
behind
once
only
and
they
knew
no
more
was
needed
by
god
said
one
of
them
in
the
ensuing
stillness
and
it
was
he
who
bled
the
most
that
was
a
felon
blow
but
the
dying
man
who
lay
before
them
made
as
though
to
smile
i
charge
you
all
to
witness
he
faintly
said
how
willingly
i
render
to
caesar
daughter
that
which
was
ever
hers
then
exton
fretted
as
if
with
a
little
trace
of
shame
who
would
have
thought
the
rascal
had
remembered
that
first
wife
of
his
so
long
caesar
daughter
saith
he
and
dares
in
extremis
to
pervert
holy
scripture
like
any
wycliffite
well
he
is
as
dead
as
that
first
caesar
now
and
our
gracious
king
i
think
will
sleep
the
better
for
it
and
yet
god
only
knows
for
they
are
an
odd
race

as
he
said
these
men

have

manuel
blood

king
richard
the
second
monarch
of
that
name
to
rule
in
england
wrenched
his
own
existence
and
nothing
more
from
the
close
wiles
of
his
cousin
harry
of
derby
who
was
now
sometimes
called
henry
of
lancaster
and
sometimes
bolingbroke
the
circumstances
of
this
evasion
having
been
recorded
in
the
preceding
tale
it
suffices
here
to
record
that
this
henry
was
presently
crowned
king
of
england
in
richard
place
all
persons
saving
only
owain
glyndwyr
and
henry
of
lancaster
believed
king
richard
dead
at
that
period
when
richard
attended
his
own
funeral
as
a
proceeding
taking
to
the
fancy
and
among
many
others
saw
the
body
of
edward
maudelain
interred
with
every
regal
ceremony
in
the
chapel
at
langley
bower
then
alone
sire
richard
crossed
the
seas
and
at
set
out
to
inspect
a
transformed
and
gratefully
untrammelling
world
wherein
not
a
foot
of
land
belonged
to
him
holland
was
the
surname
he
assumed
the
name
of
his
and
to
detail
his
asian
wanderings
would
be
tedious
and
unprofitable
but
at
the
end
of
each
four
months
would
come
to
him
a
certain
messenger
from
glyndwyr
supposed
by
richard
to
be
the
imp
orvendile
who
notoriously
ran
every
day
around
the
world
upon
the
business
it
was
in
the
isle
of
taprobane
where
the
pismires
are
as
great
as
hounds
and
mine
and
store
the
gold
of
which
the
inhabitants
afterward
rob
them
through
a
very
cunning
device
that
this
emissary
brought
the
letter
which
read
simply
now
is
england
fit
pasture
for
the
white
hart
presently
richard
holland
was
in
wales
and
then
he
rode
to
sycharth
there
after
salutation
glyndwyr
gave
an
account
of
his
long
stewardship
it
was
a
puzzling
record
of
obscure
and
tireless
machinations
with
which
we
have
no
immediate
concern
in
brief
the
barons
who
had
ousted
king
log
had
been
the
very
first
to
find
their
squinting
king
stork
intolerable
and
northumberland
worcester
douglas
mortimer
and
so
on
were
already
pledged
and
in
open
revolt
by
the
god
i
do
not
altogether
serve
owain
ended
you
have
but
to
declare
yourself
sire
and
within
the
moment
england
is
yours
richard
spoke
with
narrowed
eyes
you
forget
that
while
henry
of
lancaster
lives
no
other
man
can
ever
hope
to
reign
tranquilly
in
these
islands
come
then
the
hour
strikes
and
we
will
coax
the
devil
for
once
in
a
way
to
serve
god
oh
but
there
is
a
boundary
appointed
glyndwyr
moodily
returned
you
too
forget
that
in
cold
blood
this
henry
stabbed
my
son
but
i
do
not
forget
this
and
i
have
tried
divers
methods
which
we
need
not
speak
of
i
who
can
at
will
corrupt
the
air
and
cause
sickness
and
storms
raise
heavy
mists
and
create
plagues
and
fires
and
shipwrecks
yet
the
life
itself
i
can
not
take
for
there
is
a
boundary
appointed
sire
and
beyond
that
frontier
the
master
of
our
sabbaths
can
not
serve
us
even
though
he
would
richard
crossed
himself
you
horribly
mistake
my
meaning
your
practices
are
your
own
affair
and
in
them
i
decline
to
dabble
i
merely
design
to
trap
a
tiger
with
his
appropriate
bait
for
you
have
a
fief
at
caer
idion
i
think
very
well
i
intend
to
herd
your
sheep
there
for
a
week
or
two
after
the
honorable
example
of
apollo
it
is
your
part
to
see
that
henry
knows
i
am
living
disguised
and
defenceless
at
caer
idion
the
gaunt
welshman
chuckled
yes
squinting
henry
of
lancaster
would
cross
the
world
much
less
the
severn
to
make
quite
sure
of
death
he
would
come
in
his
own
person
with
at
most
some
twenty
trustworthy
followers
i
will
have
a
hundred
there
and
certain
aging
scores
will
then
be
settled
in
that
place
glyndwyr
meditated
afterward
very
evilly
sire
he
said
without
prelude
i
do
not
recognize
richard
of
bordeaux
you
have
garnered
much
in
travelling
why
look
you
richard
returned
i
have
garnered
so
much
that
i
do
not
greatly
care
whether
this
scheme
succeed
or
no
with
age
i
begin
to
contend
even
more
indomitably
that
a
wise
man
will
consider
nothing
very
seriously
you
barons
here
believe
it
an
affair
of
importance
who
may
chance
to
be
the
king
of
england
say
this
time
next
year
you
take
sides
between
henry
and
me
i
tell
you
frankly
that
neither
of
us
that
no
man
in
the
world
by
reason
of
innate
limitations
can
ever
rule
otherwise
than
abominably
or
ruling
can
create
anything
save
discord
nor
can
i
see
how
this
matters
either
since
the
discomfort
of
an
is
not
after
all
a
disaster
no
owain
if
the
planets
do
indeed
sing
together
it
is
depend
upon
it
to
the
burden
of
for
i
am
as
liberally
endowed
as
most
people
and
when
i
consider
my
abilities
my
performances
my
instincts
and
so
on
quite
aloofly
as
i
would
appraise
those
of
another
person
i
can
only
shrug
and
to
conceive
that
much
less
omnipotence
would
ever
concern
itself
about
the
actions
of
a
creature
so
entirely
futile
is
to
me
at
least
impossible
i
have
known
the
thought
said
owain
though
rarely
since
i
found
the
englishwoman
that
was
afterward
my
wife
and
never
since
my
son
my
gruffyd
was
murdered
by
a
jesting
man
he
was
more
like
me
than
the
others
people
said
you
are
as
yet
the
empty
scabbard
powerless
alike
for
help
or
hurt
ey
hate
or
love
must
be
the
sword
sire
that
informs
us
here
and
then
if
only
for
a
little
while
we
are
as
gods
pardie
i
have
loved
as
often
as
salomon
and
in
fourteen
kingdoms
we
of
cymry
have
a
saying
sire
that
when
a
man
loves
par
amours
the
second
time
he
may
safely
assume
that
he
has
never
been
in
love
at
all
and
i
hate
henry
of
lancaster
as
i
do
the
devil
i
greatly
fear
said
owain
with
a
sigh
lest
it
may
be
your
irreparable
malady
to
hate
nothing
not
even
that
which
you
dislike
no
you
consider
things
with
both
eyes
open
with
an
unmanly
rationality
whereas
sire
henry
views
all
matters
with
that
heroic
squint
which
came
into
your
family
from
poictesme
be
off
with
your
dusty
scandals
said
richard
laughing
so
then
glyndwyr
rode
south
to
besiege
and
burn
the
town
of
caerdyf
while
at
caer
idion
richard
holland
abode
tranquilly
for
some
three
weeks
there
was
in
this
place
only
caradawc
the
former
shepherd
his
wife
alundyne
and
their
sole
daughter
branwen
they
gladly
perceived
sire
richard
was
no
more
a
peasant
than
he
was
a
curmudgeon
as
caradawc
observed
it
is
perfectly
apparent
that
the
robe
of
padarn
beisrudd
which
refuses
to
adjust
itself
to
any
save
highborn
persons
would
fit
him
as
a
glove
does
the
hand
but
we
will
ask
no
questions
since
it
is
not
wholesome
to
dispute
the
orderings
of
owain
glyndwyr
now
day
by
day
would
richard
holland
drive
the
flocks
to
pasture
near
the
severn
and
loll
there
in
the
shade
and
make
songs
to
his
lute
he
grew
to
love
this
leisured
life
of
bright
and
open
spaces
and
its
long
solitudes
grateful
with
the
warm
odors
of
growing
things
and
with
poignant
and
the
tranquillity
of
these
meadows
that
were
always
void
of
hurry
bedrugged
the
man
through
many
fruitless
and
contented
hours
each
day
at
noon
branwen
would
bring
his
dinner
and
she
would
sometimes
chat
with
him
while
he
ate
after
supper
he
would
discourse
to
branwen
of
remote
kingdoms
through
which
as
aimlessly
as
a
wind
veers
he
had
ridden
at
adventure
among
sedate
and
alien
peoples
who
adjudged
him
a
madman
and
she
in
turn
would
tell
him
curious
tales
from
the
book
of
telling
of
gwalchmai
and
peredur
and
geraint
in
each
one
of
which
fine
heroes
she
had
presently
discerned
an
inadequate
forerunnership
of
richard
existence
this
branwen
was
a
fair
wench
slender
and
hardy
she
had
the
bold
demeanor
of
a
child
who
is
ignorant
of
evil
and
in
consequence
of
suspicion
happily
though
had
she
been
named
for
that
unhappy
lady
of
old
the
wife
of
king
matholwch
for
this
branwen
too
had
a
white
thin
wistful
face
like
that
of
an
empress
on
a
silver
coin
which
is
a
little
worn
her
eyes
were
large
and
brilliant
colored
like
clear
emeralds
and
her
abundant
hair
was
so
much
cornfloss
only
it
was
more
brightly
yellow
and
was
of
immeasurably
finer
texture
in
full
sunlight
her
cheeks
were
frosted
like
the
surface
of
a
peach
but
the
underlying
cool
pink
of
them
was
rather
that
of
a
cloud
just
after
sunset
richard
decided
in
all
a
taking
morsel
though
her
shapely
hands
were
hard
with
labor
and
she
rarely
laughed
for
as
if
in
recompense
her
heart
was
tender
and
she
rarely
ceased
to
smile
as
though
she
were
thinking
of
some
peculiar
and
wonderful
secret
which
she
intended
in
due
time
to
share
with
you
and
with
nobody
else
branwen
had
many
lovers
and
preferred
among
them
young
gwyllem
ap
llyr
a
portly
lad
who
was
handsome
enough
though
he
had
tiny
and
piggish
eyes
and
who
sang
divinely
one
day
this
gwyllem
came
to
richard
with
two
saxon
he
said
you
appear
a
stout
man
take
your
pick
of
these
then
and
have
at
you
such
are
not
the
weapons
i
would
have
named
richard
answered
yet
in
reason
messire
gwyllem
i
can
deny
you
nothing
that
means
nothing
to
me
with
that
they
laid
aside
their
coats
and
fell
to
exercise
in
these
unaccustomed
bouts
richard
was
soundly
drubbed
as
he
had
anticipated
but
he
found
himself
the
stronger
man
of
the
two
and
he
managed
somehow
to
avoid
an
absolute
overthrow
by
what
method
he
contrived
this
he
never
ascertained
i
have
forgotten
what
we
are
fighting
about
he
observed
after
ten
minutes
of
heroic
thumps
and
hangings
or
to
be
perfectly
exact
i
never
knew
but
we
will
fight
no
more
in
this
place
come
and
go
with
me
to
welshpool
messire
gwyllem
and
there
we
will
fight
to
a
conclusion
over
good
sack
and
claret
content
cried
gwyllem
but
only
if
you
yield
me
branwen
have
we
indeed
wasted
a
whole
in
squabbling
over
a
woman
richard
demanded
like
two
children
in
a
worldwide
toyshop
over
any
one
particular
toy
then
devil
take
me
if
i
am
not
heartily
ashamed
of
my
folly
though
look
you
gwyllem
i
would
speak
naught
save
commendation
of
these
delicate
and
creatures
so
long
as
one
is
able
to
approach
them
in
a
becoming
spirit
of
levity
it
is
only
their
not
infrequent
misuse
which
i
would
condemn
and
in
my
opinion
the
person
who
elects
to
build
a
shrine
for
any
one
of
them
has
only
himself
to
blame
if
his
chosen
goddess
will
accept
no
except
his
honor
and
happiness
yet
since
time
youth
have
many
fine
men
been
addicted
to
this
insane
practice
as
for
example
were
hercules
and
merlin
to
their
illimitable
sorrow
and
indeed
the
more
i
reconsider
the
old
gallantries
of
salomon
and
of
other
venerable
and
sagacious
potentates
the
more
profoundly
am
i
ashamed
of
my
sex
gwyllem
said
this
lazy
gabbling
of
yours
is
all
very
fine
perhaps
it
is
also
reasonable
only
when
you
love
you
do
not
reason
i
was
endeavoring
to
prove
that
said
richard
gently
then
they
went
to
welshpool
ride
and
tie
on
gwyllem
horse
tongue
loosened
by
the
claret
gwyllem
raved
aloud
of
branwen
like
a
babbling
faun
while
to
each
rapture
richard
affably
assented
in
his
heart
he
likened
the
boy
to
dionysos
at
naxos
and
could
find
no
blame
for
ariadne
moreover
the
room
was
comfortably
dark
and
cool
for
thick
vines
hung
about
the
windows
rustling
and
tapping
pleasantly
and
richard
was
content
she
does
not
love
me
gwyllem
cried
it
is
well
enough
i
do
not
come
to
her
as
one
merchant
to
another
since
love
was
never
bartered
listen
saxon
he
caught
up
richard
lute
the
strings
shrieked
beneath
gwyllem
fingers
as
he
fashioned
his
rude
song
sang
gwyllem
love
me
or
love
me
not
it
is
enough
that
i
have
loved
you
seeing
my
whole
life
is
uplifted
and
made
glad
by
the
glory
of
love
my
life
that
was
a
scroll
bescrawled
and
blurred
with
which
that
pity
of
his
erased
and
wrote
instead
one
lonely
word
o
branwen
i
have
accorded
you
incessant
praise
and
song
and
service
dear
because
of
this
and
always
i
have
dreamed
incessantly
who
always
dreamed
when
in
oncoming
days
this
man
or
that
shall
love
you
and
at
last
this
man
or
that
shall
win
you
it
must
be
that
loving
him
you
will
have
pity
on
me
when
happiness
engenders
memory
and
long
thoughts
nor
unkindly
of
the
past
o
branwen
of
this
i
know
not
surely
who
am
sure
that
i
shall
always
love
you
while
i
live
and
that
when
i
am
dead
with
naught
to
give
of
song
or
service
love
will
yet
endure
and
yet
retain
his
last
prerogative
when
i
lie
still
and
sleep
out
centuries
with
dreams
of
you
and
the
exceeding
love
i
bore
you
and
am
glad
dreaming
thereof
and
give
god
thanks
for
all
and
so
find
peace
o
branwen
now
were
i
to
get
as
tipsy
as
that
richard
enviously
thought
midway
in
a
return
to
his
stolid
sheep
i
would
simply
go
to
sleep
and
wake
up
with
a
headache
and
were
i
to
fall
as
many
fathoms
deep
in
love
as
this
gwyllem
ventures
or
rather
as
he
hurls
himself
with
a
splurge
i
would
perform
i
wonder
now
what
miracle
for
he
was
though
vaguely
discontent
this
gwyllem
was
so
young
so
earnest
over
every
trifle
and
above
all
was
so
untroubled
by
forethought
each
least
desire
controlled
him
as
varying
winds
sport
with
a
fallen
leaf
whose
frank
submission
to
superior
vagaries
the
boy
appeared
to
emulate
richard
saw
that
in
a
fashion
gwyllem
was
superb
and
heigho
said
richard
i
am
attestedly
a
greater
fool
than
he
but
i
begin
to
weary
of
a
folly
so
the
next
morning
came
a
ragged
man
riding
upon
a
mule
he
declared
himself
a
tinker
he
chatted
out
an
hour
with
richard
who
perfectly
recognized
him
as
sir
walter
blount
and
then
this
tinker
crossed
over
into
england
richard
whistled
now
my
cousin
will
be
quite
sure
and
now
my
anxious
cousin
will
come
to
speak
with
richard
of
bordeaux
and
now
by
every
saint
in
the
calendar
i
am
as
good
as
king
of
england
he
sat
down
beneath
a
young
oak
and
twisted
four
or
five
blades
of
grass
between
his
fingers
while
he
meditated
undoubtedly
he
would
kill
this
squinting
henry
of
lancaster
with
a
clear
conscience
and
even
with
a
certain
relish
much
as
one
crushes
the
uglier
sort
of
vermin
but
hand
upon
heart
richard
was
unable
to
avow
any
particularly
ardent
desire
for
the
scoundrel
death
thus
crudely
to
demolish
the
knave
adroit
and
schemings
savored
actually
of
grossness
the
spider
was
venomous
and
his
destruction
laudable
granted
but
in
crushing
him
you
ruined
his
web
a
miracle
of
patient
machination
which
despite
yourself
compelled
hearty
admiring
and
envy
true
the
process
would
recrown
a
certain
richard
but
then
as
richard
recalled
it
being
king
was
rather
tedious
richard
was
not
now
quite
sure
that
he
wanted
to
be
king
and
in
consequence
be
daily
plagued
by
a
host
of
vexatious
and
barons
i
shall
miss
the
little
huzzy
too
he
thought
heigho
said
richard
i
shall
console
myself
with
purchasing
all
beautiful
things
that
can
be
touched
and
handled
life
is
a
flimsy
vapor
which
passes
and
is
not
any
more
presently
branwen
will
be
married
to
this
gwyllem
and
will
be
grown
fat
and
old
and
i
shall
be
remarried
to
little
dame
isabel
and
shall
be
king
of
england
and
a
trifle
later
all
four
of
us
shall
be
dead
pending
this
deplorable
consummation
a
wise
man
will
endeavor
to
amuse
himself
next
day
he
despatched
caradawc
to
owain
glyndwyr
to
bid
the
latter
send
the
promised
implements
to
caer
idion
richard
returning
to
the
hut
the
same
evening
found
alundyne
there
alone
and
grovelling
at
the
threshold
her
forehead
was
bloodied
when
she
raised
it
and
through
tearless
sobs
told
of
what
had
happened
a
earlier
while
she
and
branwen
were
intent
upon
their
milking
gwyllem
had
ridden
up
somewhat
the
worse
for
liquor
branwen
had
called
him
sot
had
bidden
him
go
home
that
i
will
do
said
gwyllem
and
suddenly
caught
up
the
girl
alundyne
sprang
for
him
and
with
clenched
fist
gwyllem
struck
her
twice
full
in
the
face
and
laughing
rode
away
with
branwen
richard
made
no
observation
in
silence
he
fetched
his
horse
and
did
not
pause
to
saddle
it
quickly
he
rode
to
gwyllem
house
and
broke
in
the
door
against
the
farther
wall
stood
lithe
branwen
fighting
silently
her
breasts
and
shoulders
were
naked
where
gwyllem
had
torn
away
her
garments
he
wheedled
laughed
swore
and
hiccoughed
turn
by
turn
but
she
was
silent
on
guard
richard
barked
gwyllem
wheeled
his
head
twisted
toward
his
left
shoulder
and
one
corner
of
his
mouth
convulsively
snapped
upward
so
that
his
teeth
were
bared
there
was
a
knife
at
girdle
which
he
now
unsheathed
and
flung
away
he
stepped
eagerly
toward
the
snarling
welshman
and
with
both
hands
seized
the
thick
and
hairy
throat
what
followed
was
brutal
for
many
minutes
branwen
stood
with
averted
face
shuddering
she
very
dimly
heard
the
sound
of
gwyllem
impotent
fists
as
they
beat
against
the
countenance
and
body
of
richard
and
heard
the
thin
splitting
vicious
noise
of
torn
cloth
as
gwyllem
clutched
at
richard
tunic
and
tore
it
many
times
richard
did
not
utter
any
articulate
word
and
gwyllem
could
not
there
was
entire
silence
for
a
and
the
thudding
fall
of
something
ponderous
and
limp
come
richard
said
then
through
the
hut
twilight
he
came
as
glorious
in
her
eyes
as
michael
fresh
from
that
primal
battle
with
old
satan
tall
richard
came
to
her
his
face
all
blood
and
lifted
her
in
his
arms
lest
branwen
skirt
be
soiled
by
the
demolished
thing
which
sprawled
across
their
path
she
never
spoke
she
could
not
speak
in
his
arms
she
rode
homeward
passive
and
content
the
horse
trod
with
deliberation
in
the
east
the
young
moon
was
taking
heart
as
the
darkness
thickened
and
innumerable
stars
awoke
branwen
noted
these
things
incuriously
richard
was
horribly
afraid
he
it
had
been
in
sober
verity
it
had
been
richard
of
bordeaux
that
some
monstrous
force
had
seized
and
had
lifted
and
had
curtly
utilized
as
its
handiest
implement
he
had
been
and
in
the
moment
had
known
himself
to
be
the
thrown
spear
as
yet
in
air
about
to
kill
and
quite
powerless
to
refrain
from
killing
it
was
a
full
three
minutes
before
he
had
got
the
better
of
his
bewilderment
and
laughed
very
softly
lest
he
disturb
this
branwen
who
was
so
near
his
heart
next
day
she
came
to
him
at
noon
bearing
as
always
the
little
basket
it
contained
a
napkin
some
garlic
a
ham
and
a
small
soft
cheese
some
shalots
salt
nuts
wild
apples
lettuce
onions
and
mushrooms
behold
a
feast
said
richard
he
noted
then
that
she
carried
also
a
blue
pitcher
filled
with
thin
wine
and
two
cups
of
she
thanked
him
for
last
night
performance
and
drank
a
mouthful
of
wine
to
his
health
decidedly
i
shall
be
sorry
to
have
done
with
shepherding
said
richard
as
he
ate
branwen
answered
i
too
shall
be
sorry
lord
when
the
masquerade
is
ended
and
it
seemed
to
richard
that
she
sighed
and
he
was
the
happier
but
he
only
shrugged
i
am
the
wisest
person
unhanged
since
i
comprehend
my
own
folly
yet
i
grant
you
that
he
was
wise
too
the
minstrel
of
old
time
that
sang
wild
lands
and
tumbling
seas
flits
love
at
will
and
maddens
the
heart
and
beguiles
the
senses
of
all
whom
he
attacks
whether
his
quarry
be
some
monster
of
the
ocean
or
some
fierce
denizen
of
the
forest
or
man
for
thine
o
love
thine
alone
is
the
power
to
make
playthings
of
us
all
your
bard
was
wise
no
doubt
yet
it
was
not
in
such
terms
that
gwyllem
sang
of
this
passion
lord
she
demanded
shyly
how
would
you
sing
of
love
richard
was
replete
and
contented
with
the
world
he
took
up
the
lute
in
full
consciousness
that
his
compliance
was
in
large
part
cenatory
in
courtesy
thus
sang
richard
the
gods
in
honor
of
fair
branwen
worth
bore
gifts
to
her
and
jove
olympus
lord
of
earth
and
heaven
did
accord
and
hermes
brought
that
lyre
he
framed
at
birth
and
venus
her
famed
girdle
to
engirth
a
fairer
beauty
now
and
mars
his
sword
and
wrinkled
plutus
half
the
secret
hoard
and
immemorial
treasure
of
and
while
the
careful
gods
were
pondering
which
of
these
goodly
gifts
the
goodliest
was
young
cupid
came
among
them
carolling
and
proffered
unto
her
a
wherein
she
gazed
and
saw
the
goodliest
thing
that
earth
had
borne
and
heaven
might
not
surpass
three
sounds
are
rarely
heard
said
branwen
and
these
are
the
song
of
the
birds
of
rhiannon
an
invitation
to
feast
with
a
miser
and
a
speech
of
wisdom
from
the
mouth
of
a
saxon
the
song
you
have
made
of
courtesy
is
tinsel
sing
now
in
verity
richard
laughed
though
he
was
sensibly
nettled
and
perhaps
a
shade
abashed
presently
he
sang
again
sang
richard
catullus
might
have
made
of
words
that
seek
with
rippling
sound
in
soft
recurrent
ways
the
perfect
song
or
in
remoter
days
theocritus
have
hymned
you
in
glad
greek
but
i
am
not
as
they
and
dare
not
speak
of
you
unworthily
and
dare
not
praise
perfection
with
imperfect
roundelays
and
desecrate
the
prize
i
dare
to
seek
i
do
not
woo
you
then
by
fashioning
vext
analogues
you
and
guenevere
nor
do
i
come
with
agile
lips
that
bring
the
sugared
periods
of
a
sonneteer
and
bring
no
more
but
just
with
lips
that
cling
to
yours
in
murmuring
love
you
dear
richard
had
resolved
that
branwen
should
believe
him
tinsel
indeed
then
here
was
yet
more
tinsel
which
she
must
receive
as
gold
he
was
very
angry
because
his
vanity
was
hurt
and
the
spurred
him
to
a
counterfeit
so
specious
that
consciously
he
gloried
in
it
he
was
superb
and
she
believed
him
now
there
was
no
questioning
the
fact
he
saw
it
plainly
and
with
exultant
cruelty
then
curt
as
lightning
came
the
knowledge
that
what
branwen
believed
was
the
truth
richard
had
taken
just
two
strides
toward
this
fair
girl
branwen
stayed
motionless
her
lips
a
little
parted
the
affairs
of
earth
and
heaven
were
motionless
throughout
the
moment
attendant
it
seemed
to
him
and
to
him
his
whole
life
was
like
a
wave
that
trembled
now
at
full
height
and
he
was
aware
of
a
new
world
all
made
of
beauty
and
of
pity
then
the
lute
fell
from
his
spread
out
hands
and
richard
sighed
and
shrugged
there
is
a
task
set
me
he
said
it
is
god
work
i
think
but
i
do
not
know
i
only
know
that
you
are
very
beautiful
branwen
he
said
and
in
the
name
he
found
a
new
and
piercing
loveliness
and
he
said
also
go
for
i
have
loved
many
women
and
god
help
me
i
know
that
i
have
but
to
wheedle
you
and
you
too
will
yield
yonder
is
god
work
to
be
done
and
within
me
rages
a
commonwealth
of
devils
child
child
he
cried
i
am
and
ever
was
a
coward
too
timid
to
face
life
without
reserve
and
always
i
laughed
because
i
was
afraid
to
concede
that
anything
is
serious
for
a
long
while
richard
lay
at
his
ease
in
the
lengthening
shadows
of
the
afternoon
i
love
her
she
thinks
me
an
elderly
imbecile
with
a
flat
and
reedy
and
she
is
perfectly
right
she
has
never
even
entertained
the
notion
of
loving
me
that
is
well
for
or
it
may
be
the
day
after
we
must
part
forever
i
would
not
have
the
parting
make
her
sorrowful
or
not
at
least
too
unalterably
sorrowful
it
is
very
well
that
branwen
does
not
love
me
why
should
she
i
am
almost
twice
her
age
an
aging
fellow
now
battered
and
selfish
and
too
indolent
to
love
her
say
as
gwyllem
loved
her
i
did
well
to
kill
that
gwyllem
i
am
profoundly
glad
i
killed
him
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
doing
it
but
after
all
the
man
loved
her
in
his
fashion
and
to
the
uttermost
reach
of
his
gross
nature
i
love
her
in
a
rather
more
decorous
and
acceptable
fashion
it
is
true
but
only
a
half
of
me
loves
her
the
other
half
of
me
remembers
that
i
am
aging
that
caradawc
hut
is
leaky
that
in
fine
bodily
comfort
is
the
single
luxury
of
which
one
never
tires
i
am
a
very
contemptible
creature
the
empty
scabbard
of
a
man
precisely
as
owain
said
this
settled
richard
whistled
to
his
dog
the
sun
had
set
there
were
no
shadows
anywhere
as
richard
and
his
sheep
went
homeward
but
on
every
side
the
colors
of
the
world
were
more
sombre
twice
his
flock
roused
a
covey
of
partridges
which
had
settled
for
the
night
the
had
come
out
of
his
hole
and
bats
were
already
blundering
about
and
the
air
was
cooling
there
was
as
yet
but
one
star
in
the
green
and
cloudless
heaven
and
this
was
very
large
like
a
beacon
it
appeared
to
him
symbolical
that
he
trudged
away
from
this
star
next
morning
the
welshmen
came
and
now
the
trap
was
ready
for
henry
of
lancaster
it
befell
just
two
days
later
about
noon
that
while
richard
idly
talked
with
branwen
a
party
of
soldiers
some
fifteen
in
number
rode
down
the
river
bank
from
the
ford
above
their
leader
paused
then
gave
an
order
the
men
drew
rein
he
cantered
forward
god
give
you
joy
fair
sir
said
richard
when
the
cavalier
was
near
him
the
raised
his
visor
god
give
you
eternal
joy
my
fair
cousin
he
said
and
very
soon
now
send
away
this
woman
before
that
happens
which
must
happen
do
you
plan
said
richard
to
disfigure
the
stage
of
our
quiet
pastorals
with
murder
i
design
my
own
preservation
king
henry
answered
for
while
you
live
my
rule
is
insecure
i
am
sorry
richard
said
that
in
part
my
blood
is
yours
twice
he
sounded
his
horn
and
everywhere
from
rustling
underwoods
arose
the
welshmen
said
richard
you
should
read
history
more
carefully
cousin
henry
you
might
have
profited
as
i
have
done
by
considering
the
trick
which
our
grandfather
old
edward
longshanks
played
on
the
french
king
at
mezelais
as
matters
stand
your
men
are
one
to
ten
you
are
impotent
now
now
we
balance
our
accounts
these
persons
here
will
first
deal
with
your
followers
then
they
will
conduct
you
to
glyndwyr
who
has
long
desired
to
deal
with
you
himself
in
privacy
since
that
when
you
murdered
his
son
the
king
began
in
mercy
sire
and
richard
laughed
a
little
saying
that
virtue
is
not
overabundant
among
us
of
oriander
blood
as
we
both
know
no
cousin
fate
and
time
are
merry
jesters
see
now
their
latest
mockery
you
the
king
of
england
ride
to
sycharth
to
your
death
and
i
the
tender
of
sheep
depart
into
london
without
any
hindrance
to
reign
henceforward
over
these
islands
you
are
cousin
henry
as
yesterday
i
am
king
of
england
then
branwen
gave
one
sharp
brief
cry
and
richard
forgot
all
things
saving
this
girl
and
strode
to
her
he
had
caught
up
her
hard
lithe
hands
against
his
lips
he
strained
them
close
and
very
close
branwen
he
said
his
eyes
devoured
her
yes
king
she
answered
o
king
of
england
o
fool
that
i
have
been
to
think
you
less
in
a
while
richard
said
well
i
at
least
am
not
fool
enough
to
think
of
making
you
a
king
whore
so
i
must
choose
between
a
peasant
wench
and
england
now
i
choose
and
how
gladly
branwen
help
me
to
be
more
than
king
of
england
low
and
very
low
he
spoke
and
long
and
very
long
he
gazed
at
her
and
neither
seemed
to
breathe
of
what
she
thought
i
can
not
tell
you
but
in
richard
there
was
no
power
of
thought
only
a
great
wonderment
why
between
this
woman
love
and
aught
else
there
was
no
choice
for
him
he
knew
upon
a
sudden
perhaps
he
would
thus
worship
her
always
he
reflected
and
then
again
perhaps
he
would
be
tired
of
her
before
long
just
as
all
other
persons
seemed
to
abate
in
these
infatuations
meanwhile
it
was
certain
that
he
was
very
happy
no
he
could
not
go
back
to
the
throne
and
to
the
little
french
girl
who
was
in
law
his
wife
and
as
if
from
an
immense
distance
came
to
richard
the
dogged
voice
of
henry
of
lancaster
it
is
of
common
report
in
these
islands
that
i
have
a
better
right
to
the
throne
than
you
as
much
was
told
our
grandfather
king
edward
of
happy
memory
when
he
educated
you
and
had
you
acknowledged
heir
to
the
crown
but
his
love
was
so
strong
for
his
son
the
prince
of
wales
that
nothing
could
alter
his
purpose
and
indeed
if
you
had
followed
even
the
example
of
the
black
prince
you
might
still
have
been
our
king
but
you
have
always
acted
so
contrarily
to
his
admirable
precedents
as
to
occasion
the
rumor
to
be
generally
believed
throughout
england
that
you
were
not
after
all
his
son
richard
had
turned
impatiently
for
the
love
of
heaven
truncate
your
abominable
periods
be
off
with
you
yonder
across
that
river
is
the
throne
of
england
which
you
appear
through
some
lunacy
to
consider
a
desirable
possession
take
it
then
for
praise
god
the
sword
has
found
its
sheath
the
king
answered
i
do
not
ask
you
to
reconsider
your
dismissal
assuredly
richard
he
cried
a
little
shaken
i
perceive
that
until
your
death
you
will
win
contempt
and
love
from
every
person
yes
yes
for
many
years
i
have
been
the
playmate
of
the
world
said
richard
but
i
wash
my
hands
and
set
about
another
and
more
laudable
business
i
had
dreamed
certain
dreams
indeed
but
what
had
i
to
do
with
all
this
strife
between
the
devil
and
the
tiger
no
glyndwyr
will
set
up
mortimer
against
you
now
and
you
two
must
fight
it
out
i
am
no
more
his
tool
and
no
more
your
enemy
my
cousin
henry
he
said
with
quickening
voice
there
was
a
time
when
we
were
boys
and
played
together
and
there
was
no
hatred
between
us
and
i
regret
that
time
as
god
lives
i
too
regret
that
time
the
bluff
squinting
king
replied
he
stared
at
richard
for
a
while
wherein
each
understood
dear
fool
sire
henry
said
there
is
no
man
in
all
the
world
but
hates
me
saving
only
you
then
the
proud
king
clapped
spurs
to
his
proud
horse
and
rode
away
more
lately
richard
dismissed
his
wondering
marauders
now
he
and
branwen
were
alone
and
a
little
troubled
since
each
was
afraid
of
that
oncoming
moment
when
their
eyes
must
meet
so
richard
laughed
praise
god
he
wildly
cried
i
am
the
greatest
fool
unhanged
she
answered
i
am
the
happier
for
your
folly
i
am
the
happiest
of
god
creatures
and
richard
meditated
faith
of
a
gentleman
he
declared
but
you
are
nothing
of
the
sort
and
of
this
fact
i
happen
to
be
quite
certain
their
lips
met
then
and
afterward
their
eyes
and
each
of
these
ragged
peasants
was
too
glad
for
laughter

of

assaults
is
in
a
long
duel
wherein
time

are
flouted

kingdoms
are

recompensed
by
an
enduring
lunacy
story
of
the
in

grace
upon
the
feast
of
saint
bartholomew
thus
nicolas
begins
came
to
the
spanish
coast
messire
peyre
de
lesnerac
in
a
sumptuously
furnished
and
manned
by
many
persons
of
dignity
and
wealth
in
order
suitably
to
escort
the
princess
jehane
into
brittany
where
she
was
to
marry
the
duke
of
that
province
there
were
now
rejoicings
throughout
navarre
in
which
the
princess
took
but
a
nominal
part
and
young
antoine
riczi
none
at
all
this
antoine
riczi
came
to
jehane
that
august
twilight
in
the
hedged
garden
king
daughter
he
sadly
greeted
her
duchess
of
brittany
countess
of
rougemont
lady
of
nantes
and
of
guerrand
of
rais
and
of
toufon
and
guerche
she
answered
no
my
dearest
i
am
that
jehane
whose
only
title
is
the
constant
lover
and
in
the
green
twilight
lit
as
yet
by
one
star
alone
their
lips
and
desperate
young
bodies
clung
now
it
might
be
for
the
last
time
presently
the
girl
spoke
her
soft
mouth
was
lax
and
tremulous
and
her
gray
eyes
were
more
brilliant
than
the
star
yonder
the
boy
arms
were
about
her
so
that
neither
could
be
quite
unhappy
yet
friend
said
jehane
i
have
no
choice
i
must
wed
with
this
de
montfort
i
think
i
shall
die
presently
i
have
prayed
god
that
i
may
die
before
they
bring
me
to
the
dotard
bed
young
riczi
held
her
now
in
an
embrace
more
brutal
mine
mine
he
snarled
toward
the
obscuring
heavens
yet
it
may
be
i
must
live
friend
the
man
is
very
old
is
it
wicked
to
think
of
that
for
i
can
not
but
think
of
his
great
age
then
riczi
answered
my
desires
may
god
forgive
me
have
clutched
like
starving
persons
at
that
sorry
sustenance
friend
ah
fair
sweet
friend
the
man
is
human
and
must
die
but
love
we
read
is
immortal
i
am
wishful
to
kill
myself
jehane
but
oh
jehane
dare
you
to
bid
me
live
friend
as
you
love
me
i
entreat
you
to
live
friend
i
crave
of
the
eternal
father
that
if
i
falter
in
my
love
for
you
i
may
be
denied
even
the
one
bleak
night
of
ease
which
judas
knows
the
girl
did
not
weep
she
winged
a
perfectly
sincere
prayer
toward
incorruptible
saints
riczi
was
to
remember
the
fact
and
through
long
years
of
severance
for
even
now
as
riczi
went
away
from
jehane
a
shrill
was
rehearsing
yonder
behind
the
the
song
which
she
was
to
sing
at
jehane
bridal
feast
sang
this
joculatrix
when
the
morning
broke
before
us
came
the
wayward
three
astraying
chattering
in
babbling
chorus
obloquies
of
aether
saying
hoidens
that
at
pegtop
playing
flung
their
top
where
yet
it
whirls
through
the
coil
of
clouds
unstaying
for
the
fates
are
captious
girls
and
upon
the
next
day
de
lesnerac
bore
young
jehane
from
pampeluna
and
presently
to
saillé
where
old
jehan
the
brave
took
her
to
wife
she
lived
as
a
queen
but
she
was
a
woman
of
infrequent
laughter
she
had
duke
jehan
adoration
and
his
barons
obeisancy
and
his
villagers
applauded
her
passage
with
stentorian
shouts
she
passed
interminable
days
amid
bright
curious
arrasses
and
trod
listlessly
over
pavements
strewn
with
flowers
she
had
jewels
and
shimmering
purple
cloths
and
much
furniture
adroitly
carven
and
many
tapestries
of
samarcand
and
baldach
upon
which
were
embroidered
by
brown
fingers
that
time
had
turned
long
ago
to
asian
dust
innumerable
asps
and
deer
and
phoenixes
and
dragons
and
all
the
motley
inhabitants
of
air
and
of
the
thicket
but
her
memories
too
she
had
and
for
a
dreary
while
she
got
no
comfort
because
of
them
then
ambition
quickened
young
antoine
riczi
likewise
nursed
his
wound
as
best
he
might
but
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
after
jehane
wedding
his
uncle
the
vicomte
de
montbrison
a
gaunt
man
with
preoccupied
and
troubled
eyes
had
summoned
antoine
into
lyonnois
and
after
appropriate
salutation
had
informed
the
lad
that
as
the
vicomte
heir
he
was
to
marry
the
demoiselle
gerberge
de
nérac
upon
the
ensuing
michaelmas
that
i
may
not
do
said
riczi
and
since
a
chronicler
that
would
tempt
fortune
should
never
stretch
the
fabric
of
his
wares
too
thin
unlike
sir
hengist
i
merely
tell
you
these
two
dwelt
together
at
montbrison
for
a
decade
and
the
vicomte
swore
at
his
nephew
and
predicted
this
or
that
disastrous
destination
as
often
as
antoine
declined
to
marry
the
latest
of
his
uncle
candidates
in
whom
the
vicomte
was
of
an
astonishing
fertility
in
the
year
of
grace
came
the
belated
news
that
duke
jehan
had
closed
his
final
day
you
will
be
leaving
me
the
vicomte
growled
now
in
my
decrepitude
you
will
be
leaving
me
it
is
abominable
and
i
shall
in
all
likelihood
disinherit
you
this
very
night
yet
it
is
necessary
riczi
answered
and
filled
with
no
unhallowed
joy
he
rode
for
vannes
in
brittany
where
the
held
her
court
dame
jehane
had
within
that
fortnight
put
aside
her
mourning
she
sat
beneath
a
green
canopy
and
powdered
with
many
golden
stars
when
riczi
came
again
to
her
and
the
rising
saps
of
spring
were
exercising
their
august
and
formidable
influence
she
sat
alone
by
prearrangement
to
one
end
of
the
and
radiant
apartment
midway
in
the
hall
her
lords
and
divers
ladies
were
gathered
about
a
saltatrice
and
a
jongleur
who
were
diverting
the
courtiers
to
the
mincing
accompaniment
of
a
lute
but
jehane
sat
apart
from
these
frail
and
splendid
with
many
jewels
and
a
little
sad
and
antoine
riczi
found
no
power
of
speech
within
him
at
the
first
silent
he
stood
before
her
still
as
an
effigy
while
meltingly
the
jongleur
sang
jehane
said
antoine
riczi
in
a
while
have
you
then
forgotten
o
jehane
the
resplendent
woman
had
not
moved
at
all
it
was
as
though
she
were
some
tinted
and
lavishly
adorned
statue
of
barbaric
heathenry
and
he
her
postulant
and
her
large
eyes
appeared
to
judge
an
immeasurable
path
beyond
him
now
her
lips
fluttered
somewhat
i
am
the
duchess
of
brittany
she
said
in
the
phantom
of
a
voice
i
am
the
countess
of
rougemont
the
lady
of
nantes
and
of
guerrand
of
rais
and
of
toufon
and
guerche
jehane
is
dead
the
man
had
drawn
one
audible
breath
you
are
that
jehane
whose
only
title
is
the
constant
lover
friend
the
world
smirches
us
she
said
i
have
tasted
too
deep
of
wealth
and
power
i
am
drunk
with
a
deadly
wine
and
ever
i
thirst
i
thirst
jehane
do
you
remember
that
may
morning
in
pampeluna
when
first
i
kissed
you
and
about
us
sang
many
birds
then
as
now
you
wore
a
gown
of
green
jehane
friend
i
have
swayed
kingdoms
since
jehane
do
you
remember
that
august
twilight
in
pampeluna
when
last
i
kissed
you
then
as
now
you
wore
a
gown
of
green
jehane
but
i
wore
no
such
chain
as
this
about
my
neck
the
woman
answered
and
lifted
a
huge
golden
collar
garnished
with
emeralds
and
sapphires
and
with
many
pearls
friend
the
chain
is
heavy
yet
i
lack
the
will
to
cast
it
off
i
lack
the
will
antoine
and
now
with
a
sudden
shout
of
mirth
her
courtiers
applauded
the
evolutions
of
the
saltatrice
king
daughter
said
riczi
then
o
perilous
merchandise
a
god
came
to
me
and
a
sword
had
pierced
his
breast
he
touched
the
gold
hilt
of
it
and
said
back
your
weapon
i
answered
do
not
know
you
am
youth
he
said
back
your
weapon
it
is
true
she
responded
it
is
lamentably
true
that
after
we
are
as
different
persons
you
and
i
he
said
jehane
do
you
not
love
me
any
longer
remember
old
years
and
do
not
break
your
oath
with
me
jehane
since
god
abhors
nothing
so
much
as
unfaith
for
your
own
sake
jehane
ah
no
not
for
your
sake
nor
for
mine
but
for
the
sake
of
that
blithe
jehane
whom
so
you
tell
me
time
has
slain
once
or
twice
she
blinked
as
if
dazzled
by
a
light
of
intolerable
splendor
but
otherwise
she
stayed
rigid
you
have
dared
messire
to
confront
me
with
the
navarrese
that
once
was
i
and
i
requite
the
austere
woman
rose
messire
you
swore
to
me
long
since
eternal
service
i
claim
my
right
in
domnei
yonder
the
man
in
black
and
silver
is
the
earl
of
worcester
the
king
of
england
ambassador
in
common
with
whom
the
wealthy
dowager
of
brittany
has
signed
a
certain
contract
go
you
then
with
worcester
into
england
as
my
proxy
and
in
that
island
as
my
proxy
become
the
wife
of
the
king
of
england
messire
your
audience
is
done
riczi
said
this
can
you
hurt
me
any
more
jehane
no
even
in
hell
they
can
not
hurt
me
now
yet
i
at
least
keep
faith
and
in
your
face
i
fling
faith
like
a
glove
it
may
be
but
clean
and
i
will
go
jehane
her
heart
raged
poor
glorious
fool
she
thought
had
you
but
the
wit
even
now
to
use
me
brutally
even
now
to
drag
me
from
this
daïs
instead
he
went
away
from
her
smilingly
treading
through
the
hall
with
many
affable
salutations
while
the
jongleur
sang
sang
the
jongleur
there
is
a
land
those
hereabout
ignore
its
gates
are
barred
by
titan
twins
named
fear
and
doubt
these
mercifully
guard
that
land
we
seek
the
land
so
fair
and
all
the
fields
thereof
where
daffodils
flaunt
everywhere
and
ouzels
chant
of
love
lest
we
attain
the
whence
clouded
rise
and
vipers
from
a
slimy
strand
lift
glittering
cold
eyes
now
the
parable
all
may
understand
and
surely
you
know
the
name
of
the
land
ah
never
a
guide
or
ever
a
chart
may
safely
lead
you
about
this
land
the
land
of
the
human
heart
and
the
following
morning
being
duly
empowered
antoine
riczi
sailed
for
england
in
company
with
the
earl
of
worcester
and
upon
saint
richard
day
the
next
ensuing
was
at
eltham
as
proxy
of
jehane
married
in
his
own
person
to
the
bloat
king
henry
the
fourth
of
that
name
to
reign
this
king
was
that
same
squinting
harry
of
derby
called
also
henry
of
lancaster
and
bolingbroke
who
stole
his
cousin
crown
and
about
whom
i
have
told
you
in
the
preceding
story
first
sire
henry
placed
the
ring
on
riczi
finger
and
then
spoke
antoine
riczi
very
loud
and
clear
i
antoine
riczi
in
the
name
of
my
worshipful
lady
dame
jehane
the
daughter
of
messire
charles
until
lately
king
of
navarre
the
duchess
of
brittany
and
the
countess
of
rougemont
do
take
you
sire
henry
of
lancaster
king
of
england
and
in
title
of
france
and
lord
of
ireland
to
be
my
husband
and
thereto
i
antoine
riczi
in
the
spirit
of
my
said
lady
the
speaker
paused
here
to
regard
the
gross
hulk
of
masculinity
before
him
and
then
smiled
very
sadly
in
precisely
the
spirit
of
my
said
lady
i
plight
you
my
troth
afterward
the
king
made
him
presents
of
some
rich
garments
of
scarlet
trimmed
with
costly
furs
and
of
four
silk
belts
studded
with
silver
and
gold
and
with
valuable
clasps
of
which
the
owner
might
well
be
proud
and
riczi
returned
to
lyonnois
depardieux
his
uncle
said
so
you
return
alone
i
return
as
did
prince
troilus
said
riczi
to
boast
to
you
of
liberal
entertainment
in
the
tent
of
diomede
you
are
certainly
an
inveterate
fool
the
vicomte
considered
after
a
prolonged
appraisal
of
his
face
since
there
is
always
a
deal
of
other
flesh
as
yet
unmortgaged
boy
with
my
eyes
the
vicomte
said
in
another
voice
i
have
heard
of
the
task
put
upon
you
and
i
would
that
i
were
god
to
punish
as
is
fitting
but
you
are
welcome
home
my
lad
so
these
two
abode
together
at
montbrison
for
a
long
time
and
in
the
purlieus
of
that
place
hunted
and
hawked
and
made
sonnets
once
in
a
while
and
read
aloud
from
old
romances
some
five
days
out
of
the
seven
the
verses
of
riczi
were
in
the
year
of
grace
made
public
not
without
acclamation
and
thereafter
the
stripling
comte
de
charolais
future
heir
to
all
burgundy
and
a
zealous
patron
of
rhyme
was
much
at
montbrison
and
there
conceived
for
antoine
riczi
such
admiration
as
was
possible
to
a
very
young
man
only
in
the
year
of
grace
the
vicomte
being
then
bedridden
died
without
any
disease
and
of
no
malady
save
the
inherencies
of
his
age
i
entreat
of
you
my
nephew
he
said
at
last
that
always
you
use
as
touchstone
the
brave
deed
you
did
at
eltham
it
is
necessary
for
a
gentleman
to
serve
his
lady
according
to
her
commandments
but
you
performed
the
most
absurd
and
the
most
cruel
task
which
any
woman
ever
imposed
upon
her
lover
and
servitor
in
domnei
i
laugh
at
you
and
i
envy
you
thus
he
died
about
martinmas
now
was
antoine
riczi
a
powerful
baron
but
he
got
no
comfort
of
his
lordship
because
that
old
incendiary
the
king
of
darkness
daily
added
fuel
to
a
smouldering
sorrow
until
grief
quickened
into
vaulting
flames
of
wrath
and
of
disgust
what
now
avail
my
riches
said
the
vicomte
how
much
wealthier
was
i
when
i
was
loved
and
was
myself
an
eager
lover
i
relish
no
other
pleasures
than
those
of
love
i
am
love
sot
drunk
with
a
deadly
wine
poor
fool
and
ever
i
thirst
all
my
chattels
and
my
acres
appear
to
me
to
be
bright
vapors
and
the
more
my
dominion
and
my
power
increase
the
more
rancorously
does
my
heart
sustain
its
bitterness
over
having
been
robbed
of
that
fair
merchandise
which
is
the
king
of
england
to
hate
her
is
scant
comfort
and
to
despise
her
none
at
all
since
it
follows
that
i
who
am
unable
to
forget
the
wanton
am
even
more
to
be
despised
than
she
i
will
go
into
england
and
execute
what
mischief
i
may
against
her
the
new
vicomte
de
montbrison
set
forth
for
paris
first
to
do
homage
for
his
fief
and
secondly
to
be
accredited
for
some
plausible
mission
into
england
but
in
paris
he
got
disquieting
news
jehane
husband
was
dead
and
her
stepson
henry
the
fifth
monarch
of
that
name
to
reign
in
britain
had
invaded
france
to
support
preposterous
claims
which
the
man
advanced
to
the
crown
of
that
latter
kingdom
and
as
the
earth
is
altered
by
the
advent
of
winter
so
was
the
appearance
of
france
transformed
by
king
henry
coming
and
everywhere
the
nobles
were
stirred
up
to
arms
the
castles
were
closed
the
huddled
cities
were
fortified
and
on
every
side
arose
entrenchments
thus
through
this
sudden
turn
was
the
new
vicomte
the
dreamer
and
the
recluse
caught
up
by
the
career
of
events
as
a
straw
is
borne
away
by
a
torrent
when
the
french
lords
marched
with
their
vassals
to
harfleur
where
they
were
soundly
drubbed
by
the
king
of
england
as
afterward
at
agincourt
but
in
the
year
of
grace
there
was
a
breathing
space
for
discredited
france
and
presently
the
vicomte
de
montbrison
was
sent
into
england
as
ambassador
he
got
in
london
a
fruitless
audience
of
king
henry
whose
demands
were
such
as
rendered
a
renewal
of
the
war
inevitable
and
afterward
got
in
the
month
of
april
about
the
day
of
palm
sunday
at
the
queen
of
an
interview
with
queen
jehane
unaccountably
omits
to
mention
that
during
the
french
wars
she
had
ruled
england
as
regent
with
signal
capacity
although
this
fact
as
you
will
see
more
lately
is
the
pivot
of
his
chronicle
a
curled
pert
page
took
the
vicomte
to
where
she
sat
alone
by
prearrangement
in
a
chamber
with
painted
walls
profusely
lighted
by
the
sun
and
made
pretence
to
weave
a
tapestry
when
the
page
had
gone
she
rose
and
cast
aside
the
shuttle
and
then
with
a
glad
and
wordless
cry
stumbled
toward
the
vicomte
madame
and
queen
he
coldly
said
his
judgment
found
in
her
a
quite
ordinary
frightened
woman
aging
now
but
still
very
handsome
in
these
black
and
shimmering
gold
robes
but
all
his
other
faculties
found
her
desirable
and
with
a
contained
hatred
he
had
perceived
as
if
by
the
terse
illumination
of
a
thunderbolt
that
he
could
never
love
any
woman
save
the
woman
whom
he
most
despised
she
said
i
had
forgotten
i
had
remembered
only
you
antoine
and
navarre
and
the
navarrese
now
for
a
little
jehane
paced
the
gleaming
and
apartment
as
a
bright
leopardess
might
tread
her
cage
then
she
wheeled
friend
i
think
that
god
himself
has
deigned
to
avenge
you
all
misery
my
reign
has
been
first
hotspur
then
prim
worcester
harried
us
came
glyndwyr
afterward
to
prick
us
with
his
devils
horns
followed
the
dreary
years
that
linked
me
to
the
rotting
corpse
which
god
leprosy
devoured
while
the
poor
furtive
thing
yet
moved
and
endured
its
share
in
the
punishment
of
manuel
poisonous
blood
all
misery
antoine
and
now
i
live
beneath
a
sword
you
have
earned
no
more
he
said
you
have
earned
no
more
o
jehane
whose
only
title
is
the
constant
lover
he
spat
it
out
she
came
uncertainly
toward
him
as
though
he
had
been
some
not
implacable
knave
with
a
bludgeon
for
the
king
hates
me
she
plaintively
said
and
i
live
beneath
a
sword
the
big
boy
has
hated
me
from
the
first
for
all
his
and
now
he
lacks
the
money
to
pay
his
troops
and
i
am
the
wealthiest
person
within
his
realm
i
am
a
woman
and
alone
in
a
foreign
land
so
i
must
wait
and
wait
and
wait
antoine
till
he
devises
some
accusation
friend
i
live
as
did
saint
damoclus
beneath
a
sword
antoine
she
wailed
for
now
the
pride
of
queen
jehane
was
shattered
utterly
i
am
held
as
a
prisoner
for
all
that
my
chains
are
of
gold
yet
it
was
not
until
of
late
he
observed
that
you
disliked
the
metal
which
is
the
substance
of
all
crowns
and
now
the
woman
lifted
toward
him
her
massive
golden
necklace
garnished
with
emeralds
and
sapphires
and
with
many
pearls
and
in
the
sunlight
the
gems
were
tawdry
things
friend
the
chain
is
heavy
and
i
lack
the
power
to
cast
it
off
the
navarrese
we
know
of
wore
no
such
perilous
fetters
ah
you
should
have
mastered
me
at
vannes
you
could
have
done
so
very
easily
but
you
only
talked
oh
mary
pity
us
you
only
talked
and
i
could
find
only
a
servant
where
i
had
sore
need
to
find
a
master
let
all
women
pity
me
but
now
came
many
armed
soldiers
into
the
apartment
with
spirit
queen
jehane
turned
to
meet
them
and
you
saw
that
she
was
of
royal
blood
for
now
the
pride
of
many
emperors
blazed
and
informed
her
body
as
light
occupies
a
lantern
at
last
you
come
for
me
messieurs
whereas
the
leader
of
these
soldiers
read
from
a
parchment
whereas
the
king
stepmother
queen
jehane
is
accused
by
certain
persons
of
an
act
of
that
with
diabolical
and
subtile
methods
wrought
privily
to
destroy
the
king
the
said
dame
jehane
is
by
the
king
committed
all
her
attendants
being
removed
to
the
custody
of
sir
john
pelham
who
will
at
the
king
pleasure
confine
her
within
pevensey
castle
there
to
be
kept
under
sir
control
the
lands
and
other
properties
of
the
said
dame
jehane
being
hereby
forfeit
to
the
king
whom
god
preserve
harry
of
monmouth
said
jehane
ah
my
tall
stepson
could
i
but
come
to
you
very
quietly
with
a
knife
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
the
gold
about
her
person
glittered
in
the
sunlight
witchcraft
ohimé
one
never
disproves
that
friend
now
are
you
avenged
the
more
abundantly
young
riczi
is
avenged
the
vicomte
said
and
i
came
hither
desiring
vengeance
she
wheeled
a
lithe
flame
he
thought
of
splendid
fury
and
in
the
gutter
jehane
dares
say
what
queen
jehane
upon
the
throne
might
never
say
had
i
reigned
all
these
years
as
mistress
not
of
england
but
of
europe
had
nations
wheedled
me
in
the
place
of
barons
young
riczi
had
been
none
the
less
avenged
bah
what
do
these
persons
matter
take
now
your
petty
vengeance
drink
deep
of
it
and
know
that
always
within
my
heart
the
navarrese
has
lived
to
shame
me
know
that
you
despise
jehane
the
purchased
woman
and
that
jehane
loves
you
and
that
the
love
of
proud
jehane
creeps
like
a
beaten
cur
toward
your
feet
in
the
sight
of
common
men
and
know
that
riczi
is
avenged
you
milliner
into
england
i
came
desiring
vengeance
apples
of
sodom
o
bitter
fruit
the
vicomte
thought
o
fitting
harvest
of
a
fool
assiduous
husbandry
they
took
her
from
him
and
that
afternoon
after
long
meditation
the
vicomte
de
montbrison
entreated
a
second
private
audience
of
king
henry
and
readily
obtained
it
unhardy
is
unseely
the
vicomte
said
at
this
interview
conclusion
the
tale
tells
that
the
vicomte
returned
to
france
and
within
this
realm
assembled
all
such
lords
as
the
abuses
of
the
isabeau
had
more
notoriously
dissatisfied
the
vicomte
had
upon
occasion
an
invaluable
power
of
speech
and
now
so
great
was
the
devotion
of
love
dupe
so
heartily
so
hastily
did
he
design
to
remove
the
discomforts
of
queen
jehane
that
now
his
eloquence
was
twin
to
belial
insidious
talking
when
that
fiend
tempts
us
to
some
proud
iniquity
then
presently
these
lords
had
sided
with
king
henry
as
did
the
vicomte
de
montbrison
in

field
next
as
luck
would
have
it
jehan
was
slain
at
montereau
and
a
little
later
the
new
duke
of
burgundy
who
loved
the
vicomte
as
he
loved
no
other
man
had
shifted
his
coat
forsaking
france
these
treacheries
brought
down
the
wavering
scales
of
warfare
suddenly
with
an
aweful
clangor
and
now
in
france
persons
spoke
of
the
vicomte
de
montbrison
as
they
would
speak
of
ganelon
or
of
iscariot
and
in
every
was
king
henry
proclaimed
as
governor
of
the
realm
meantime
queen
jehane
had
been
conveyed
to
prison
and
lodged
therein
she
had
the
liberty
of
a
tiny
garden
and
of
two
scantily
furnished
chambers
the
brace
of
females
whom
pelham
had
provided
for
the
queen
attendance
might
speak
to
her
of
nothing
that
occurred
without
the
gates
of
pevensey
and
she
saw
no
other
persons
save
her
confessor
a
dominican
had
men
already
lain
jehane
within
the
massive
and
gilded
coffin
of
a
queen
the
outer
world
would
have
made
as
great
a
turbulence
in
her
ears
but
in
the
year
of
grace
upon
the
feast
of
saint
bartholomew
and
about
vespers
for
thus
it
wonderfully
fell
out
one
of
those
grim
attendants
brought
to
her
the
first
man
save
the
fat
confessor
whom
the
queen
had
seen
within
five
years
the
proud
frail
woman
looked
and
what
she
saw
was
the
inhabitant
of
all
her
dreams
said
jehane
this
is
ill
done
time
has
avenged
you
be
contented
with
that
knowledge
and
for
heaven
sake
do
not
endeavor
to
moralize
over
the
ruin
which
heaven
has
made
and
justly
made
of
queen
jehane
as
i
perceive
you
mean
to
do
she
leaned
backward
in
the
chair
very
coarsely
clad
in
brown
but
knowing
that
her
coloring
was
excellent
that
she
had
miraculously
preserved
her
figure
and
that
she
did
not
look
her
real
age
by
a
good
ten
years
such
reflections
beget
spiritual
comfort
even
in
a
prison
friend
the
man
now
said
i
do
not
come
with
such
intent
as
my
mission
will
readily
attest
nor
to
any
ruin
as
your
mirror
will
attest
instead
madame
i
come
as
the
emissary
of
king
henry
now
dying
at
vincennes
and
with
letters
to
the
lords
and
bishops
of
his
council
dying
the
man
restores
to
you
your
liberty
and
your
your
bed
and
all
your
movables
and
six
gowns
of
such
fashion
and
such
color
as
you
may
elect
then
with
hurried
speech
he
told
her
of
five
years
events
of
how
within
that
period
king
henry
had
conquered
france
and
had
married
the
french
king
daughter
and
had
begotten
a
boy
who
would
presently
inherit
the
united
realms
of
france
and
england
since
in
the
supreme
hour
of
triumph
king
henry
had
been
stricken
with
a
mortal
sickness
and
now
lay
dying
or
perhaps
already
dead
at
vincennes
and
of
how
with
his
penultimate
breath
the
prostrate
conqueror
had
restored
to
queen
jehane
all
properties
and
all
honors
which
she
formerly
enjoyed
i
shall
once
more
be
regent
the
woman
said
when
the
vicomte
had
made
an
end
antoine
i
shall
presently
be
regent
both
of
france
and
of
england
since
dame
katharine
is
but
a
child
jehane
stood
motionless
save
for
the
fine
hands
that
plucked
the
air
mistress
of
europe
absolute
mistress
and
with
an
infant
ward
now
may
god
have
mercy
on
my
unfriends
for
they
will
soon
perceive
great
need
of
it
yet
was
mercy
ever
the
prerogative
of
royal
persons
the
vicomte
suavely
said
and
the
navarrese
we
know
of
was
both
royal
and
very
merciful
o
constant
lover
the
speech
was
as
a
abruptly
suspicion
kindled
in
her
shrewd
gray
eyes
harry
of
monmouth
feared
neither
man
nor
god
it
needed
more
than
any
repentance
to
frighten
him
into
restoring
my
liberty
there
was
a
silence
you
a
frenchman
come
as
the
emissary
of
king
henry
who
has
devastated
france
are
there
no
english
lords
then
left
alive
of
his
army
the
vicomte
de
montbrison
said
there
is
at
all
events
no
person
better
fitted
to
patch
up
this
dishonorable
business
of
your
captivity
in
which
no
clean
man
would
care
to
meddle
she
appraised
this
and
said
with
entire
irrelevance
the
world
has
smirched
you
somehow
at
last
you
have
done
something
save
consider
how
badly
i
treated
you
i
praise
god
antoine
for
it
brings
you
nearer
he
told
her
all
king
henry
it
appeared
had
dealt
with
him
at
havering
in
perfect
frankness
the
king
needed
money
for
his
wars
in
france
and
failing
the
seizure
of
jehane
enormous
wealth
had
exhausted
every
resource
and
france
i
mean
to
have
the
king
said
now
the
world
knows
you
enjoy
the
favor
of
the
comte
de
charolais
so
get
me
an
alliance
with
burgundy
against
my
imbecile
brother
of
france
and
dame
jehane
shall
repossess
her
liberty
there
you
have
my
price
and
this
price
i
paid
the
vicomte
sternly
said
for
is
unseely
satan
whispered
and
i
knew
that
duke
philippe
trusted
me
yea
all
burgundy
i
marshalled
under
your
stepson
banner
and
for
three
years
i
fought
beneath
his
loathed
banner
until
at
troyes
we
had
trapped
and
slain
the
last
loyal
frenchman
and
in
france
my
lands
are
confiscate
and
there
is
not
an
honest
frenchman
but
spits
upon
my
name
all
infamy
i
come
to
you
for
this
last
time
jehane
as
a
man
already
dead
i
come
to
you
jehane
for
in
france
they
thirst
to
murder
me
and
england
has
no
further
need
of
montbrison
her
blunted
and
her
filthy
instrument
the
woman
nodded
here
you
have
set
my
thankless
service
above
your
life
above
your
honor
i
find
the
rhymester
glorious
and
very
vile
all
vile
he
answered
and
outworn
king
daughter
i
swore
to
you
long
since
eternal
service
of
love
i
freely
gave
you
yonder
in
navarre
as
yonder
at
eltham
i
crucified
my
innermost
heart
for
your
delectation
yet
i
at
least
keep
faith
and
in
your
face
i
fling
faith
like
a
glove
outworn
it
may
be
and
god
knows
unclean
yet
i
at
least
keep
faith
lands
and
wealth
have
i
given
up
for
you
o
king
daughter
and
life
itself
have
i
given
you
and
lifelong
service
have
i
given
you
and
all
that
i
had
save
honor
and
at
the
last
i
give
you
honor
too
now
let
the
naked
fool
depart
jehane
for
he
has
nothing
more
to
give
while
the
vicomte
de
montbrison
spoke
thus
she
had
leaned
upon
the
sill
of
an
open
casement
indeed
it
had
been
better
she
said
still
with
her
face
averted
and
gazing
downward
at
the
beneath
it
had
been
far
better
had
we
never
met
for
this
love
of
ours
has
proven
a
tyrannous
and
evil
lord
i
have
had
everything
and
upon
each
feast
of
will
and
sense
the
world
afforded
me
this
love
has
swept
down
like
a
harpy
was
it
not
a
harpy
you
called
the
bird
in
that
old
poem
of
yours
to
rob
me
of
delight
and
you
have
had
nothing
for
he
has
pilfered
you
of
life
giving
only
dreams
in
exchange
my
poor
antoine
and
he
has
led
you
at
the
last
to
infamy
we
are
as
god
made
us
and
i
may
not
understand
why
he
permits
this
despotism
thereafter
somewhere
below
a
peasant
sang
as
he
passed
supperward
through
the
green
twilight
lit
as
yet
by
one
star
alone
sang
the
peasant
king
jesus
hung
upon
the
cross

he

it
may
be
that
in
some
sort
the
jingle
answers
me
then
said
jehane
and
she
began
with
an
odd
breathlessness
friend
when
king
henry
dies
and
even
now
he
dies
shall
i
not
as
regent
possess
such
power
as
no
woman
has
ever
wielded
in
europe
can
aught
prevent
this
it
is
true
he
answered
you
leave
this
prison
to
rule
over
england
again
and
over
conquered
france
as
well
and
naught
can
prevent
it
unless
friend
i
were
wedded
to
a
frenchman
then
would
the
stern
english
lords
never
permit
that
i
have
any
finger
in
the
government
she
came
to
him
with
conspicuous
deliberation
and
rested
her
hands
upon
his
breast
friend
i
am
weary
of
these
tinsel
splendors
what
are
this
england
and
this
france
to
me
who
crave
the
real
kingdom
her
mouth
was
tremulous
and
lax
and
her
gray
eyes
were
more
brilliant
than
the
star
yonder
the
man
arms
were
about
her
and
of
the
face
i
can
not
tell
you
king
daughter
mistress
of
half
europe
i
am
a
beggar
an
outcast
as
a
leper
among
honorable
persons
but
it
was
as
though
he
had
not
spoken
friend
it
was
for
this
i
have
outlived
these
garish
fevered
years
it
was
this
which
made
me
glad
when
i
was
a
child
and
laughed
without
knowing
why
that
i
might
give
up
this
power
for
love
of
you
my
and
soiled
antoine
was
as
i
now
know
the
end
to
which
the
eternal
father
created
me
for
look
you
she
pleaded
to
surrender
absolute
dominion
over
half
europe
is
a
sacrifice
assure
me
that
it
is
a
sacrifice
antoine
o
glorious
fool
delude
me
into
the
belief
that
i
surrender
much
in
choosing
you
nay
i
know
it
is
as
nothing
beside
what
you
have
given
up
for
me
but
it
is
all
i
have
it
is
all
i
have
antoine
he
drew
a
deep
and
breath
that
seemed
to
inform
his
being
with
an
indomitable
vigor
and
grief
and
doubtfulness
went
quite
away
from
him
love
leads
us
he
said
and
through
the
sunlight
of
the
world
love
leads
us
and
through
the
filth
of
it
love
leads
us
but
always
in
the
end
if
we
but
follow
without
swerving
love
leads
upward
yet
o
god
upon
the
cross
thou
that
in
the
article
of
death
didst
pardon
dysmas

what
maimed

ah
but
we

thus
nicolas
begins
queen
isabeau
fled
with
her
daughter
the
lady
katharine
to
chartres
there
the
queen
was
met
by
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
these
two
laid
their
heads
together
to
such
good
effect
that
presently
they
got
back
into
paris
and
in
its
public
places
massacred
some
three
thousand
armagnacs
that
however
is
a
matter
which
touches
history
the
root
of
our
concernment
is
that
when
the
queen
and
the
duke
rode
off
to
attend
to
this
butcher
business
the
lady
katharine
was
left
behind
in
the
convent
of
saint
scholastica
which
then
stood
upon
the
outskirts
of
chartres
in
the
bend
of
the
eure
just
south
of
that
city
she
dwelt
for
a
year
in
this
place
there
one
finds
her
upon
the
day
of
the
decollation
of
saint
john
the
baptist
the
fine
august
morning
that
starts
the
tale
katharine
the
fair
men
called
her
with
considerable
show
of
reason
she
was
very
tall
and
slim
as
a
rush
her
eyes
were
large
and
black
having
an
extreme
lustre
like
the
gleam
of
undried
ink
a
lustre
at
some
times
uncanny
her
abundant
hair
too
was
black
and
seemed
doubly
sombre
by
contrast
with
the
gold
netting
which
confined
it
her
mouth
was
scarlet
all
curves
and
her
complexion
was
famous
for
its
brilliancy
only
a
precisian
would
have
objected
that
she
possessed
the
valois
nose
long
and
thin
and
somewhat
unduly
overhanging
the
mouth
as
she
came
through
the
orchard
crimson
garbed
she
paused
with
lifted
eyebrows
beyond
the
orchard
wall
there
was
a
hodgepodge
of
noises
among
which
a
nice
ear
might
distinguish
the
clatter
of
hoofs
a
yelping
and
scurrying
and
a
contention
of
soft
bodies
and
above
all
a
man
voice
commanding
the
turmoil
she
was
seventeen
so
she
climbed
into
the
crotch
of
an
and
peered
over
the
wall
he
was
in
rusty
brown
and
not
unshabby
but
her
regard
swept
over
this
to
his
face
and
there
noted
how
his
eyes
shone
like
blue
winter
stars
under
the
tumbled
yellow
hair
and
noted
the
flash
of
his
big
teeth
as
he
swore
between
them
he
held
a
dead
fox
by
the
brush
which
he
was
cutting
off
two
hounds
lank
and
wolfish
were
scaling
his
huge
body
in
frantic
attempts
to
get
at
the
carrion
a
horse
grazed
close
at
hand
so
for
a
she
saw
him
then
he
flung
the
tailless
body
to
the
hounds
and
in
the
act
spied
two
black
eyes
peeping
through
the
he
laughed
all
mirth
to
the
heels
of
him
mademoiselle
i
fear
we
have
disturbed
your
devotions
but
i
had
not
heard
that
it
was
a
benedictine
custom
to
rehearse
aves
in
then
as
she
leaned
forward
both
elbows
resting
more
comfortably
upon
the
wall
and
thereby
disclosing
her
slim
body
among
the
foliage
like
a
crimson
flower
he
said
you
are
not
a
nun
blood
of
god
you
are
the
princess
katharine
the
nuns
her
present
guardians
would
have
declared
the
ensuing
action
horrific
for
katharine
smiled
frankly
at
him
and
asked
how
could
he
thus
recognise
her
at
one
glance
he
answered
slowly
i
have
seen
your
portrait
hah
your
portrait
he
jeered
head
flung
back
and
big
teeth
glinting
in
the
sunlight
there
is
a
painter
who
merits
crucifixion
she
considered
this
indicative
of
a
cruel
disposition
but
also
of
a
fine
taste
in
the
liberal
arts
aloud
she
stated
you
are
not
a
frenchman
messire
i
do
not
understand
how
you
can
have
seen
my
portrait
the
man
stood
for
a
moment
twiddling
the
i
am
a
harper
my
princess
i
have
visited
the
courts
of
many
kings
though
never
that
of
france
i
perceive
i
have
been
woefully
unwise
this
trenched
upon
insolence
the
look
of
his
eyes
indeed
carried
it
well
past
the
frontier
but
she
found
the
statement
interesting
straightway
she
touched
the
kernel
of
those
legends
whispered
about
dom
manuel
reputed
descendants
you
have
then
seen
the
king
of
england
yes
highness
is
it
true
that
in
him
the
devil
blood
of
oriander
has
gone
mad
and
that
he
eats
children
like
agrapard
and
angoulaffre
of
the
broken
teeth
his
gaze
widened
i
have
heard
a
deal
of
scandal
concerning
the
man
but
certainly
i
never
heard
that
katharine
settled
back
luxuriously
in
the
crotch
of
the
tell
me
about
him
composedly
he
sat
down
upon
the
grass
and
began
to
acquaint
her
with
his
knowledge
and
opinions
concerning
henry
the
fifth
of
that
name
to
reign
in
england
and
the
son
of
that
squinting
harry
of
derby
about
whom
i
have
told
you
so
much
before
katharine
punctuated
the
harper
discourse
with
eager
questionings
which
are
not
absolutely
to
our
purpose
in
the
main
this
harper
thought
the
man
now
buffeting
france
a
just
king
and
he
had
heard
when
the
crown
was
laid
aside
sire
henry
was
sufficiently
jovial
and
even
prankish
the
harper
educed
anecdotes
he
considered
that
the
king
would
manifestly
take
rouen
which
the
insatiable
man
was
now
besieging
was
the
king
in
treaty
for
the
hand
of
the
infanta
of
aragon
yes
he
undoubtedly
was
katharine
sighed
her
pity
for
this
woman
and
now
tell
me
about
yourself
he
was
it
appeared
alain
maquedonnieux
a
harper
by
vocation
and
by
birth
a
native
of
ireland
beyond
the
fact
that
it
was
a
savage
kingdom
adjoining
cataia
katharine
knew
nothing
of
ireland
the
harper
assured
her
that
in
this
she
was
misinformed
since
the
kings
of
england
claimed
ireland
as
an
appanage
though
the
irish
themselves
were
of
two
minds
as
to
the
justice
of
these
pretensions
all
in
all
he
considered
that
ireland
belonged
to
saint
patrick
and
that
the
holy
man
had
never
accredited
a
vicar
doubtless
by
the
advice
of
god
alain
said
for
i
have
read
in
master
roger
de
wendover
chronicles
of
how
at
the
dread
day
of
judgment
all
the
irish
are
to
muster
before
the
high
and
pious
patrick
as
their
liege
lord
and
father
in
the
spirit
and
by
him
be
conducted
into
the
presence
of
god
and
of
how
by
virtue
of
saint
patrick
request
all
the
irish
will
die
seven
years
to
an
hour
before
the
second
coming
of
christ
in
order
to
give
the
blessed
saint
sufficient
time
to
marshal
his
company
which
is
considerable
katharine
admitted
the
convenience
of
this
arrangement
as
well
as
the
neglect
of
her
education
alain
gazed
up
at
her
for
a
long
while
as
if
in
reflection
and
presently
said
doubtless
the
lady
heleine
of
argos
also
was
thus
and
found
in
books
less
diverting
reading
than
in
the
faces
of
men
it
flooded
katharine
cheeks
with
a
livelier
hue
but
did
not
vex
her
irretrievably
if
she
chose
to
read
this
man
face
the
meaning
was
plain
enough
i
give
you
the
gist
of
their
talk
and
that
in
all
conscience
is
trivial
but
it
was
a
day
when
one
entered
love
wardship
with
a
plunge
not
in
more
modern
fashion
venturing
forward
bit
by
bit
as
though
love
were
so
much
cold
water
so
they
talked
for
a
long
while
with
laughter
mutually
provoked
and
shared
with
divers
eloquent
and
dangerous
pauses
the
harper
squatted
upon
the
ground
the
princess
leaned
over
the
wall
but
to
all
intent
they
sat
together
upon
the
loftiest
turret
of
paradise
and
it
was
a
full
two
hours
before
katharine
hinted
at
departure
alain
rose
approaching
the
wall
i
ride
for
milan
to
take
service
with
duke
filippo
i
had
broken
my
journey
these
three
days
past
at
châteauneuf
yonder
where
this
fox
has
been
harrying
my
chickens
i
went
out
to
slay
him
and
he
led
me
his
murderer
to
the
fairest
lady
earth
may
boast
do
you
not
think
that
in
returning
good
for
evil
this
fox
was
a
true
christian
my
princess
katharine
said
i
lament
his
destruction
farewell
messire
alain
and
since
chance
brought
you
hither
destiny
brought
me
hither
alain
affirmed
a
mastering
hunger
in
his
eyes
destiny
has
been
kind
i
shall
make
a
prayer
to
her
that
she
continue
so
but
when
katharine
demanded
what
this
prayer
would
be
alain
shook
his
tawny
head
presently
you
shall
know
highness
but
not
now
i
return
to
châteauneuf
on
certain
necessary
businesses
i
set
out
at
cockcrow
for
milan
and
the
visconti
livery
farewell
he
mounted
and
rode
away
in
the
golden
august
sunlight
the
hounds
frisking
about
him
the
was
fastened
in
his
hat
thus
tristran
de
léonois
may
have
ridden
in
drowned
cornwall
thus
statelily
and
composedly
katharine
thought
gazing
after
him
she
went
to
her
apartments
singing
an
inane
song
about
the
amorous
and
joyful
time
of
spring
when
everything
and
everybody
is
happy
el
tems
amoreus
plein
de
joie
el
tems
où
tote
riens
and
burst
into
a
sudden
passion
of
tears
there
were
born
every
day
she
reflected
such
hosts
of
who
were
not
princesses
and
therefore
compelled
to
marry
detestable
kings
dawn
found
her
in
the
orchard
she
was
to
remember
that
it
was
a
cloudy
morning
and
that
trailed
from
the
more
distant
trees
in
the
slaty
twilight
the
garden
verdure
was
lustreless
the
grass
and
foliage
were
uniformly
sombre
save
where
dewdrops
showed
like
beryls
nowhere
in
the
orchard
was
there
absolute
shadow
nowhere
a
vista
unblurred
in
the
east
between
horizon
and
zenith
two
belts
of
coppery
light
flared
against
the
gray
sky
like
embers
swaddled
by
ashes
the
birds
were
waking
there
were
occasional
scurryings
in
and
outbursts
of
peevish
twittering
to
attest
as
much
and
presently
came
a
singing
less
musical
than
that
of
many
a
bird
perhaps
but
far
more
grateful
to
the
girl
who
heard
it
heart
in
mouth
a
lute
accompanied
the
song
demurely
sang
alain
o
madam
destiny
omnipotent
be
not
too
obdurate
to
us
who
pray
that
this
our
transient
grant
of
youth
be
spent
in
laughter
as
befits
a
holiday
from
which
the
evening
summons
us
away
from
which
wakens
us
to
strife
and
toil
and
grief
and
wisdom
and
grudge
us
not
life
o
madam
destiny
omnipotent
why
need
our
elders
trouble
us
at
play
we
know
that
very
soon
we
shall
repent
the
idle
follies
of
our
holiday
and
being
old
shall
be
as
wise
as
they
but
now
we
are
not
wise
and
lute
and
fife
plead
sweetlier
than
axioms
so
grudge
us
not
life
o
madam
destiny
omnipotent
you
have
given
us
youth
and
must
we
cast
away
the
cup
undrained
and
our
one
coin
unspent
because
our
elders
beards
and
hearts
are
gray
they
have
forgotten
that
if
we
delay
death
claps
us
on
the
shoulder
and
with
knife
or
cord
or
fever
flouts
the
prayer
we
pray
us
not
life
madam
recall
that
in
the
sun
we
play
but
for
an
hour
then
have
the
worm
for
wife
the
tomb
for
habitation
and
grudge
us
not
life
candor
in
these
matters
is
best
katharine
scrambled
into
the
crotch
of
the
the
dew
pattered
sharply
about
her
but
the
princess
was
not
in
a
mood
to
appraise
discomfort
you
came
this
harper
said
transfigured
and
then
again
you
came
she
breathed
yes
so
for
a
long
time
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
she
found
adoration
in
his
eyes
and
quailed
before
it
and
in
the
man
mind
not
a
grimy
and
mean
incident
of
the
past
but
marshalled
to
leer
at
his
unworthiness
yet
in
that
primitive
garden
the
first
man
and
woman
meeting
knew
no
sweeter
terror
it
was
by
the
minstrel
that
a
familiar
earth
and
the
grating
speech
of
earth
were
earlier
regained
the
affair
is
of
the
suddenest
alain
observed
and
he
now
swung
the
lute
behind
him
he
indicated
no
intention
of
touching
her
though
he
might
easily
have
done
so
as
he
sat
there
exalted
by
the
height
of
his
horse
a
meteor
arrives
with
more
prelude
but
love
is
an
arbitrary
lord
desiring
my
heart
he
has
seized
it
and
accordingly
i
would
now
brave
hell
to
come
to
you
and
finding
you
there
would
esteem
hell
a
i
have
already
made
my
prayer
to
destiny
that
she
concede
me
love
now
of
god
our
father
and
master
i
entreat
quick
death
if
i
am
not
to
win
you
for
god
willing
i
shall
come
to
you
again
even
if
in
order
to
do
this
i
have
to
split
the
world
like
a
rotten
orange
madness
oh
brave
sweet
madness
katharine
said
you
are
a
minstrel
and
i
am
a
king
daughter
is
it
madness
why
then
i
think
sane
persons
are
to
be
commiserated
and
indeed
i
spy
in
all
this
some
design
across
half
the
earth
i
came
to
you
led
by
a
fox
hey
god
face
alain
swore
the
foxes
which
samson
that
old
sinewy
captain
loosed
among
the
corn
of
heathenry
kindled
no
disputation
such
as
this
fox
has
set
afoot
that
was
an
affair
of
standing
corn
and
olives
spoilt
a
bushel
or
so
of
disaster
now
poised
kingdoms
topple
on
the
brink
of
ruin
there
will
be
martial
argument
shortly
if
you
bid
me
come
again
i
bid
you
come
said
katharine
and
after
they
had
stared
at
each
other
for
a
long
while
he
rode
away
in
silence
it
was
through
a
dank
and
world
that
she
stumbled
conventward
while
out
of
the
east
the
sun
came
bathed
in
mists
a
watery
sun
no
brighter
than
a
silver
coin
and
for
a
month
the
world
seemed
no
less
dreary
but
about
michaelmas
the
sent
for
her
at
the
hôtel
de
matters
were
much
the
same
katharine
found
her
mother
in
rage
over
the
failure
of
a
third
attempt
to
poison
the
dauphin
of
vienne
as
queen
isabeau
had
previously
poisoned
her
two
elder
sons
i
might
here
trace
out
a
curious
similitude
between
the
valois
and
that
race
which
jason
very
anciently
slew
at
colchis
since
the
world
was
never
at
peace
so
long
as
any
two
of
them
existed
but
king
charles
greeted
his
daughter
with
ampler
deference
esteeming
her
to
be
the
wife
of
presbyter
john
the
tyrant
of
aethiopia
however
ingenuity
had
just
suggested
for
king
charles
amusement
and
he
paid
little
attention
nowadays
to
any
one
save
his
opponent
at
this
new
game
so
the
french
king
chirped
his
senile
jests
over
the
while
the
king
of
england
was
besieging
the
french
city
of
rouen
sedulously
and
without
mercy
in
late
autumn
an
armament
from
ireland
joined
henry
forces
the
irish
fought
naked
it
was
said
with
long
knives
katharine
heard
discreditable
tales
of
these
irish
and
reflected
how
gross
are
the
exaggerations
of
rumor
in
the
year
of
grace
in
january
the
burgesses
of
rouen
having
consumed
their
horses
and
finding
frogs
and
rats
unpalatable
yielded
the
town
it
was
the
who
brought
the
news
to
katharine
god
is
asleep
the
queen
said
and
while
he
nods
the
butcher
of
agincourt
has
stolen
our
good
city
of
rouen
she
sat
down
and
breathed
heavily
never
was
any
poor
woman
so
pestered
as
i
the
puddings
were
quite
uneatable
as
you
saw
for
yourself
and
on
sunday
the
englishman
entered
rouen
in
great
splendor
attended
by
his
chief
nobles
but
the
butcher
rode
alone
and
before
him
went
a
page
carrying
a
on
the
point
of
his
lance
i
put
it
to
you
is
that
the
contrivance
of
a
sane
man
euh
euh
dame
isabeau
squealed
on
a
sudden
you
are
bruising
me
katharine
had
gripped
her
by
the
shoulder
the
king
of
england
a
tall
fair
man
with
big
teeth
a
tiny
wen
upon
his
neck
here
and
with
his
left
cheek
scarred
with
blue
eyes
very
bright
bright
as
tapers
she
poured
out
her
questions
in
a
torrent
and
awaited
the
answer
seeming
not
to
breathe
at
all
i
believe
so
the
queen
said
and
they
say
too
that
he
has
the
damned
squint
of
old
manuel
the
redeemer
o
god
said
katharine
ay
our
only
hope
now
and
may
god
show
him
no
more
mercy
than
has
this
misbegotten
english
butcher
shown
us
the
good
lady
desired
with
fervor
the
hog
having
won
our
normandy
is
now
advancing
on
paris
itself
he
repudiated
the
aragonish
alliance
last
august
and
until
last
august
he
was
content
with
normandy
they
tell
us
but
now
he
swears
to
win
all
france
the
man
is
a
madman
and
scythian
tamburlaine
was
more
lenient
and
i
do
not
believe
that
in
all
france
there
is
a
cook
who
understands
his
business
she
went
away
whimpering
and
proceeded
to
get
tipsy
the
princess
remained
quite
still
as
dame
isabeau
had
left
her
you
may
see
a
hare
crouch
so
at
sight
of
the
hounds
finally
the
girl
spoke
aloud
until
last
august
katharine
said
until
last
august
kingdoms
topple
on
the
brink
of
ruin
now
that
you
bid
me
come
to
you
and
i
bade
this
devil
grandson
come
to
me
as
my
lover
presently
she
went
into
her
oratory
and
began
to
pray
in
the
midst
of
her
invocation
she
wailed
fool
fool
how
could
i
have
thought
him
less
than
a
king
you
are
to
imagine
her
breast
thus
adrum
with
remorse
and
hatred
of
herself
the
while
that
town
by
town
fell
before
the
invader
like
every
rumor
of
defeat
and
the
news
of
some
fresh
defeat
came
daily
was
her
arraignment
impotently
she
cowered
at
knees
knowing
herself
a
murderess
whose
infamy
was
still
afoot
outpacing
her
prayers
whose
victims
were
battalions
tarpeia
and
pisidicé
and
rahab
were
her
sisters
she
hungered
in
her
abasement
for
judith
nobler
guilt
in
may
he
came
to
her
a
truce
was
patched
up
and
french
and
english
met
amicably
in
a
great
plain
near
meulan
a
square
space
was
staked
out
and
on
three
sides
boarded
in
the
fourth
side
being
the
river
seine
this
enclosure
the
jehan
of
burgundy
and
katharine
entered
from
the
french
side
simultaneously
the
english
king
appeared
accompanied
by
his
brothers
the
dukes
of
clarence
and
gloucester
and
followed
by
the
earl
of
warwick
katharine
raised
her
eyes
with
i
know
not
what
lingering
hope
but
it
was
he
a
young
zeus
now
triumphant
and
uneager
in
his
helmet
in
place
of
a
plume
he
wore
a
spangled
with
jewels
these
six
entered
the
tent
pitched
for
the
conference
the
hanging
of
blue
velvet
embroidered
with
of
gold
blurred
before
the
girl
eyes
and
there
the
earl
of
warwick
embarked
upon
a
sea
of
rhetoric
his
french
was
indifferent
his
periods
were
interminable
and
his
demands
exorbitant
in
brief
the
king
of
england
wanted
katharine
and
most
of
france
with
a
reversion
at
the
french
death
of
the
entire
kingdom
meanwhile
sire
henry
sat
in
silence
his
eyes
glowing
i
have
come
he
said
under
cover
of
warwick
oratory
i
have
come
again
my
lady
katharine
gaze
flickered
over
him
liar
she
said
very
softly
has
god
no
thunders
remaining
in
his
armory
that
this
vile
thief
still
goes
unblasted
would
you
steal
love
as
well
as
kingdoms
his
ruddy
face
was
now
white
i
love
you
katharine
yes
she
answered
for
i
am
your
pretext
i
can
well
believe
messire
that
you
love
your
pretext
for
theft
and
murder
neither
spoke
after
this
and
presently
the
earl
of
warwick
having
come
to
his
peroration
the
matter
was
adjourned
till
the
next
day
the
party
separated
it
was
not
long
before
katharine
had
informed
her
mother
that
god
willing
she
would
never
again
look
upon
the
king
of
england
face
uncoffined
isabeau
found
her
a
madwoman
the
girl
swept
opposition
before
her
with
gusts
of
demoniacal
fury
wept
shrieked
tore
at
her
hair
and
eventually
fell
into
a
sort
of
epileptic
seizure
between
rage
and
terror
she
became
a
horrid
frenzied
beast
i
do
not
dwell
upon
this
for
it
is
not
a
condition
in
which
the
comeliest
maid
shows
to
advantage
but
for
the
valois
insanity
always
lurked
at
the
next
corner
and
they
knew
it
to
save
the
girl
reason
the
queen
was
forced
to
break
off
all
discussion
of
the
match
accordingly
the
duke
of
burgundy
went
next
day
to
the
conference
alone
jehan
began
with
ifs
and
over
these
flimsy
barriers
henry
already
fretted
by
katharine
scorn
presently
vaulted
to
a
towering
fury
fair
cousin
the
king
said
after
a
deal
of
vehement
bickering
we
wish
you
to
know
that
we
will
have
the
daughter
of
your
king
and
that
we
will
drive
both
him
and
you
out
of
this
kingdom
the
duke
answered
not
without
spirit
sire
you
are
pleased
to
say
so
but
before
you
have
succeeded
in
ousting
my
lord
and
me
from
this
realm
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
you
will
be
very
heartily
tired
at
this
the
king
turned
on
his
heel
over
his
shoulder
he
flung
i
am
tireless
also
i
am
agile
as
a
fox
in
the
pursuit
of
my
desires
say
that
to
your
princess
then
he
went
away
in
a
rage
it
had
seemed
an
approvable
business
to
win
love
incognito
according
to
the
example
of
many
ancient
emperors
but
in
practice
he
had
tripped
over
an
ugly
outgrowth
from
the
legendary
custom
the
girl
hated
him
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
and
it
was
equally
certain
he
loved
her
particularly
caustic
was
the
reflection
that
a
twitch
of
his
finger
would
get
him
katharine
as
his
wife
for
before
long
the
was
again
attempting
secret
negotiations
to
bring
this
about
yes
he
could
get
the
girl
body
by
a
couple
of
and
had
he
been
older
that
might
have
contented
him
as
it
was
what
he
wanted
was
to
rouse
the
look
her
eyes
had
borne
in
chartres
orchard
that
tranquil
morning
and
this
one
could
not
readily
secure
by
fiddling
with
seals
and
parchments
you
see
his
position
this
young
man
now
loved
the
princess
too
utterly
to
take
her
on
and
this
marriage
was
now
his
one
possible
excuse
for
ceasing
from
victorious
warfare
so
he
blustered
and
the
fighting
recommenced
and
he
slew
in
a
despairing
rage
knowing
that
by
every
movement
of
his
arm
he
became
to
her
so
much
the
more
detestable
then
the
vicomte
de
montbrison
as
you
have
heard
betrayed
france
and
king
henry
began
to
strip
the
french
realm
of
provinces
as
you
peel
the
layers
from
an
onion
by
the
may
of
the
year
of
grace
france
was
and
knew
herself
to
be
not
beaten
but
demolished
only
a
of
the
french
army
lay
entrenched
at
troyes
where
king
charles
and
his
court
awaited
henry
decision
as
to
the
action
if
he
chose
to
destroy
them
root
and
branch
he
could
and
they
knew
such
mercy
as
was
in
the
man
to
be
quite
untarnished
by
previous
using
sire
henry
drew
up
a
small
force
before
the
city
and
made
no
overtures
toward
either
peace
or
this
was
the
posture
of
affairs
on
the
evening
of
the
sunday
after
ascension
day
when
katharine
sat
at
cards
with
her
father
in
his
apartments
at
the
hôtel
de
ville
the
king
was
pursing
his
lips
over
an
alternative
play
when
somebody
began
singing
below
in
the
courtyard
sang
the
voice
i
can
find
no
meaning
in
life
that
have
weighed
the
world
and
it
was
abundant
with
folly
and
rife
with
sorrows
brittle
as
glass
and
with
joys
that
flicker
and
pass
like
dreams
through
a
fevered
head
and
like
the
dripping
of
rain
in
gardens
naked
and
dead
is
the
obdurate
thin
refrain
of
our
youth
which
is
presently
dead
and
she
whom
alone
i
have
loved
looks
ever
with
loathing
on
me
as
one
she
hath
seen
disproved
and
stained
with
such
smirches
as
be
not
ever
cleansed
utterly
and
is
both
to
remember
the
days
when
destiny
fixed
her
name
as
the
theme
and
the
goal
of
my
praise
and
my
love
engenders
shame
and
i
stain
what
i
strive
for
and
praise
o
love
most
perfect
of
all
just
to
have
known
you
is
well
and
it
heartens
me
now
to
recall
that
just
to
have
known
you
is
well
and
naught
else
is
desirable
save
only
to
do
as
you
willed
and
to
love
you
my
whole
life
long
but
this
heart
in
me
is
filled
with
hunger
cruel
and
strong
and
with
hunger
unfulfilled
fond
heart
though
thy
hunger
be
as
a
flame
that
wanders
unstilled
there
is
none
more
perfect
than
she
malise
now
came
into
the
room
and
without
speaking
laid
a
before
the
princess
katharine
twirled
it
in
her
hand
staring
at
the
table
so
you
are
in
his
pay
malise
i
am
sorry
but
you
know
that
your
employer
is
master
here
who
am
i
to
forbid
him
entrance
the
girl
went
away
silently
abashed
and
the
princess
sat
quite
still
tapping
the
brush
against
the
table
they
do
not
want
me
to
sign
another
treaty
do
they
her
father
asked
timidly
it
appears
to
me
they
are
always
signing
treaties
and
i
can
not
see
that
any
good
comes
of
it
and
i
would
have
won
the
last
game
katharine
if
malise
had
not
interrupted
us
you
know
i
would
have
won
yes
father
you
would
have
won
oh
he
must
not
see
you
katharine
cried
a
great
tide
of
love
mounting
in
her
breast
the
love
that
draws
a
mother
fiercely
to
shield
her
backward
boy
father
will
you
not
go
into
your
chamber
i
have
a
new
book
for
you
father
all
pictures
dear
come
she
was
coaxing
him
when
sire
henry
appeared
in
the
doorway
but
i
do
not
wish
to
look
at
pictures
charles
said
peevishly
i
wish
to
play
cards
you
are
an
ungrateful
daughter
katharine
you
are
never
willing
to
amuse
me
he
sat
down
with
a
whimper
and
began
to
pluck
at
his
dribbling
lips
katharine
had
moved
a
little
toward
the
door
her
face
was
white
now
welcome
sire
she
said
welcome
o
great
conqueror
who
in
your
hour
of
triumph
can
find
no
nobler
recreation
than
to
shame
a
maid
with
her
past
folly
it
was
valorously
done
sire
see
father
here
is
the
king
of
england
come
to
observe
how
low
we
sit
that
yesterday
were
lords
of
france
the
king
of
england
echoed
charles
and
he
rose
now
to
his
feet
i
thought
we
were
at
war
with
him
but
my
memory
is
treacherous
you
perceive
brother
of
england
i
am
planning
a
new
and
my
mind
is
somewhat
preëmpted
i
recall
now
that
you
are
in
treaty
for
my
daughter
hand
katharine
is
a
good
girl
a
fine
upstanding
girl
but
i
suppose
he
paused
as
if
to
regard
and
hear
some
invisible
counsellor
and
then
briskly
resumed
yes
i
suppose
policy
demands
that
she
should
marry
you
we
trammelled
kings
can
never
go
free
of
policy
ey
my
compère
of
england
no
it
was
through
policy
i
wedded
her
mother
and
we
have
been
very
unhappy
isabeau
and
i
a
word
in
your
ear
madame
isabeau
soul
formerly
inhabited
a
sow
as
pythagoras
teaches
and
when
our
saviour
cast
it
out
at
gadara
the
influence
of
the
moon
drew
it
hither
henry
did
not
say
anything
steadily
his
calm
blue
eyes
appraised
dame
katharine
and
king
charles
went
on
very
knowingly
oho
these
latinists
can
not
hoodwink
me
you
observe
though
by
ordinary
it
chimes
with
my
humor
to
appear
content
policy
again
for
once
roused
i
am
terrible
in
the
great
under
the
bleeding
feet
of
lazarus
i
slew
ten
flies
very
black
they
were
the
black
shrivelled
souls
of
parricides
and
afterward
i
wept
for
it
i
often
weep
the
mediterranean
hath
its
sources
in
my
eyes
for
my
daughter
cheats
at
cards
cheats
sir
and
i
her
father
the
incessant
peering
the
stealthy
cunning
with
which
charles
whispered
this
the
confidence
with
which
he
clung
to
his
destroyer
hand
was
that
of
a
conspiring
child
come
father
katharine
said
come
away
to
bed
dear
hideous
basilisk
he
spat
at
her
dare
you
rebel
against
me
am
i
not
king
of
france
and
is
it
not
blasphemy
for
a
king
of
france
to
be
mocked
frail
moths
that
flutter
about
my
splendor
he
shrieked
in
an
unheralded
frenzy
beware
of
me
beware
for
i
am
omnipotent
i
am
king
of
france
heaven
regent
at
my
command
the
winds
go
about
the
earth
and
nightly
the
stars
are
kindled
for
my
recreation
perhaps
i
am
mightier
than
god
but
i
do
not
remember
now
the
reason
is
written
down
and
lies
somewhere
under
a
bench
now
i
sail
for
england
eia
eia
i
go
to
ravage
england
terrible
and
merciless
but
i
must
have
my
goodman
devil
for
in
england
the
cats
of
the
wait
unfed
he
went
out
of
the
room
giggling
and
in
the
corridor
began
to
sing
a
hundred
thousand
times
i
go
to
seek
the
evangelist
for
here
all
persons
cheat
and
lie
all
this
while
henry
remained
immovable
his
eyes
fixed
upon
katharine
thus
she
meditated
he
stood
among
frenchmen
he
was
the
boulder
and
they
the
waters
that
babbled
and
fretted
about
him
but
she
turned
and
met
his
gaze
squarely
she
noted
now
for
the
first
time
how
oddly
his
left
eyebrow
drooped
katharine
said
and
that
is
the
king
whom
you
have
conquered
is
it
not
a
notable
conquest
to
overcome
so
wise
a
king
to
pilfer
renown
from
an
idiot
there
are
in
troyes
rogues
doubly
damned
who
would
scorn
the
action
now
shall
i
fetch
my
mother
sire
the
commander
of
that
great
army
which
you
overcame
as
the
hour
is
late
she
is
by
this
time
tipsy
but
she
will
come
or
perhaps
she
is
with
some
paid
lover
but
if
this
conqueror
this
second
alexander
wills
it
she
will
come
o
god
the
girl
wailed
on
a
sudden
o
just
and
god
are
not
we
of
valois
so
contemptible
that
in
conquering
us
it
is
the
victor
who
is
shamed
flower
of
the
marsh
he
said
and
his
voice
pulsed
with
tender
cadences
flower
of
the
marsh
it
is
not
the
king
of
england
who
now
comes
to
you
but
alain
the
harper
henry
plantagenet
god
has
led
hither
by
the
hand
to
punish
the
sins
of
this
realm
and
to
reign
in
it
like
a
true
king
henry
plantagenet
will
cast
out
the
valois
from
the
throne
they
have
defiled
as
darius
cast
out
belshazzar
for
such
is
the
desire
and
the
intent
of
god
but
to
you
comes
alain
the
harper
not
as
a
conqueror
but
as
a
suppliant
alain
who
has
loved
you
these
two
years
past
and
who
now
kneels
before
you
entreating
grace
katharine
looked
down
into
his
countenance
for
to
his
speech
he
had
fitted
action
suddenly
and
for
the
first
time
she
understood
that
he
believed
france
to
be
his
by
divine
favor
and
heaven
peculiar
intervention
he
thought
himself
god
factor
not
his
rebel
he
was
rather
stupid
this
huge
handsome
squinting
boy
and
as
she
comprehended
this
her
hand
went
to
his
shoulder
half
maternally
it
is
nobly
done
sire
but
i
understand
you
must
marry
me
in
order
to
uphold
your
claim
to
france
you
sell
and
i
with
my
body
purchase
peace
for
france
there
is
no
need
of
a
lover
posture
when
hucksters
meet
so
changed
he
said
and
he
was
silent
for
an
interval
still
kneeling
then
he
began
you
force
me
to
point
out
that
i
do
not
need
any
pretext
for
holding
france
france
lies
before
me
prostrate
by
god
singular
grace
i
reign
in
this
fair
kingdom
mine
by
right
of
conquest
and
an
alliance
with
the
house
of
valois
will
neither
make
nor
mar
me
she
was
unable
to
deny
this
unpalatable
as
was
the
fact
but
i
love
you
and
therefore
as
man
wooes
woman
i
sue
to
you
do
you
not
understand
that
there
can
be
between
us
no
question
of
expediency
katharine
in
chartres
orchard
there
met
a
man
and
a
maid
we
know
of
now
in
troyes
they
meet
again
not
as
princess
and
king
but
as
man
and
maid
the
wooer
and
the
wooed
once
i
touched
your
heart
i
think
and
now
in
all
the
world
there
is
one
thing
i
covet
to
gain
for
the
poor
king
some
portion
of
that
love
you
would
have
squandered
on
the
harper
his
hand
closed
upon
her
hand
at
his
touch
the
girl
composure
vanished
my
lord
you
woo
too
timidly
for
one
who
comes
with
many
advocates
i
am
daughter
to
the
king
of
france
and
next
to
my
soul
salvation
i
esteem
the
welfare
of
france
can
i
then
fail
to
love
the
king
of
england
who
chooses
the
blood
of
my
countrymen
as
a
judicious
garb
to
come
in
how
else
since
you
have
ravaged
my
native
land
since
you
have
besmirched
the
name
i
bear
since
yonder
afield
every
wound
in
my
dead
and
yet
unburied
frenchmen
is
to
me
a
mouth
which
shrieks
your
infamy
he
rose
and
yet
for
all
that
you
love
me
she
could
not
at
the
first
effort
find
words
with
which
to
answer
him
but
presently
she
said
quite
simply
to
see
you
lying
in
your
coffin
i
would
willingly
give
up
my
hope
of
heaven
for
heaven
can
afford
no
sight
more
desirable
you
loved
alain
i
loved
the
husk
of
a
man
you
can
never
comprehend
how
utterly
i
loved
him
you
are
stubborn
i
shall
have
trouble
with
you
but
this
notion
of
yours
is
plainly
a
mistaken
notion
that
you
love
me
is
indisputable
and
this
i
propose
to
demonstrate
you
will
observe
that
i
am
quite
unarmed
except
for
this
dagger
which
i
now
throw
out
of
the
window
with
the
word
it
jangled
in
the
courtyard
below
i
am
in
troyes
alone
among
some
thousand
frenchmen
any
one
of
whom
would
willingly
give
his
life
for
the
privilege
of
taking
mine
you
have
but
to
sound
the
gong
beside
you
and
in
a
few
moments
i
shall
be
a
dead
man
strike
then
for
with
me
dies
the
english
power
in
france
strike
katharine
if
you
see
in
me
but
the
king
of
england
she
was
rigid
and
his
heart
leapt
when
he
saw
it
was
because
of
terror
you
came
alone
you
dared
he
answered
with
a
wonderful
smile
proud
spirit
how
else
might
i
conquer
you
you
have
not
conquered
katharine
lifted
the
baton
beside
the
gong
poising
it
god
had
granted
her
prayer
to
save
france
now
the
past
and
the
ignominy
of
the
past
might
be
merged
in
judith
nobler
guilt
but
i
must
tell
you
that
in
the
supreme
hour
destiny
at
her
beck
her
main
desire
was
to
slap
the
man
for
his
childishness
oh
he
had
no
right
thus
to
besot
himself
with
adoration
this
dejection
at
her
feet
of
his
high
destiny
awed
her
and
pricked
her
too
with
her
inability
to
understand
him
angrily
she
flung
away
the
baton
go
ah
go
she
cried
like
one
strangling
there
has
been
enough
of
bloodshed
and
i
must
spare
you
loathing
you
as
i
do
for
i
can
not
with
my
own
hand
murder
you
but
the
king
was
a
kindly
tyrant
crushing
independence
from
his
associates
as
lesser
folk
squeeze
water
from
a
sponge
i
can
not
go
thus
acknowledge
me
to
be
alain
the
man
you
love
or
else
strike
upon
the
gong
you
are
cruel
she
wailed
in
her
torture
yes
i
am
cruel
katharine
raised
straining
arms
above
her
head
in
a
hard
gesture
of
despair
you
have
conquered
you
know
that
i
love
you
oh
if
i
could
find
words
to
voice
my
shame
to
shriek
it
in
your
face
i
could
better
endure
it
for
i
love
you
with
all
my
body
and
heart
and
soul
i
love
you
mine
is
the
agony
for
i
love
you
and
presently
i
shall
stand
quite
still
and
see
little
frenchmen
scramble
about
you
as
hounds
leap
about
a
stag
and
afterward
kill
you
and
after
that
i
shall
live
i
preserve
france
but
after
i
have
slain
you
henry
i
must
live
mine
is
the
agony
the
enduring
agony
she
stayed
motionless
for
an
interval
god
god
let
me
not
fail
katharine
breathed
and
then
o
fair
sweet
friend
i
am
about
to
commit
a
vile
action
but
it
is
for
the
sake
of
the
france
that
i
love
next
to
god
as
judith
gave
her
body
to
holofernes
i
crucify
my
heart
for
the
preservation
of
france
very
calmly
she
struck
upon
the
gong
if
she
could
have
found
any
reproach
in
his
eyes
during
the

he

his
soldiers
no
doubt
in

les
choses
que
je
dis
avoir
vues
et
sues

plaist
here
is
appended
the
epilogue
that
messire
nicolas
de
caen
affixed
to
the
book
which
he
had
made
according
to
the
best
of
his
ability
and
which
in
consequence
he
dared
not
appraise
son
intrepidly
depart
my
little
book
into
the
presence
of
that
most
illustrious
lady
who
bade
me
compile
you
bow
down
before
her
judgment
and
if
her
sentence
be
that
of
a
fiery
death
i
counsel
you
not
to
grieve
at
what
can
not
be
avoided
but
if
by
any
miracle
that
glorious
strong
fortress
of
the
weak
consider
it
advisable
that
you
remain
unburned
pass
thence
my
little
book
to
every
man
who
may
desire
to
purchase
you
and
live
out
your
little
hour
among
these
very
credulous
persons
and
at
your
appointed
season
perish
and
be
forgotten
thus
may
you
share
your
betters
fate
and
be
at
one
with
those
famed
comedies
of
greek
menander
and
all
the
poignant
songs
of
sappho
quid
thus
little
book
i
charge
you
to
poultice
your
oblivion
pandoniae
restat
nisi
nomen
athenae
yet
even
in
your
brief
existence
you
may
chance
to
meet
with
those
who
will
affirm
that
the
stories
you
narrate
are
not
true
and
protest
assertions
which
are
only
fables
to
these
you
will
reply
that
i
your
maker
was
in
my
youth
the
quite
unworthy
servant
of
the
most
high
and
noble
lady
dame
jehane
and
in
this
period
at
and
about
her
house
of
conversed
in
my
own
person
with
dame
katharine
then
happily
remarried
to
a
private
gentleman
of
wales
and
so
obtained
the
matter
of
the
ninth
story
and
of
the
tenth
authentically
you
will
say
also
that
messire
de
montbrison
afforded
me
the
main
matter
of
the
sixth
and
seventh
stories
and
many
of
the
songs
which
this
book
contains
and
that
moreover
i
once
journeyed
to
caer
idion
and
talked
for
some
two
hours
with
richard
holland
whom
i
found
a
very
old
and
garrulous
and
cheery
person
and
got
of
him
the
matter
of
the
eighth
tale
in
this
dizain
together
with
much
information
as
concerns
the
sixth
and
the
seventh
and
you
will
add
that
the
matter
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
tales
was
in
every
detail
related
to
me
by
my
most
illustrious
mistress
madame
isabella
of
portugal
who
had
this
information
from
her
mother
an
equally
veracious
and
immaculate
lady
and
one
that
was
in
youth
dame
philippa
most
dear
associate
for
the
rest
you
must
admit
unwillingly
the
first
three
stories
in
this
book
to
be
a
thought
less
solidly
confirmed
although
as
you
will
say
even
in
these
histories
i
have
not
ever
deviated
from
what
was
at
odd
times
narrated
to
me
by
the
aforementioned
persons
and
have
always
endeavored
honestly
to
piece
together
that
which
they
told
me
i
have
pieced
together
these
tales
about
the
women
who
intermarried
not
very
enviably
with
the
blood
of
edward
longshanks
because
it
seems
to
me
that
these
tales
when
they
are
rightly
considered
compose
the
initial
portion
of
a
troubling
history
whether
as
some
declare
the
taint
came
from
manuel
of
poictesme
or
whether
as
yet
others
say
this
poison
was
inherited
from
the
demon
wife
whom
foulques
plantagenet
fetched
out
of
hell
the
blood
in
these
men
was
not
all
human
these
men
might
not
tread
equally
with
human
beings
their
wives
suffered
therefor
just
as
they
that
had
inherited
this
blood
suffered
therefor
and
all
england
suffered
therefor
and
the
upshot
of
it
i
have
narrated
elsewhere
in
the
book
called
and
entitled
red
which
composes
the
final
portion
of
this
history
and
tells
of
the
last
spilling
and
of
the
extinction
of
this
blood
also
my
little
book
you
will
encounter
more
malignant
people
who
will
jeer
at
you
and
will
say
that
you
and
i
have
cheated
them
of
your
to
these
you
will
reply
with
plutarch
mi
aurum
posco
nec
mi
secondly
you
will
say
that
of
necessity
the
tailor
cuts
the
coat
according
to
his
cloth
and
that
he
can
not
undertake
to
robe
an
ephialtes
or
a
towering
orion
suitably
when
the
resources
of
his
shop
amount
to
only
a
few
yards
of
cambric
indeed
had
i
the
power
to
make
you
better
my
little
book
i
would
have
exercised
that
power
to
the
utmost
a
good
conscience
is
a
continual
feast
and
i
summon
high
heaven
to
be
my
witness
that
had
i
been
homer
you
had
awed
the
world
another
iliad
i
lament
your
inability
to
do
this
as
heartily
as
any
person
living
yet
heaven
willed
it
and
it
is
in
consequence
to
heaven
these
aforementioned
cavillers
should
rightfully
complain
so
to
such
impious
people
do
you
make
no
answer
at
all
unless
indeed
you
should
elect
to
answer
them
by
repetition
of
this
song
which
i
now
make
for
you
my
little
book
at
your
departure
from
me
and
the
song
runs
in
this
fashion
depart
depart
my
book
and
live
and
die
dependent
on
the
idle
fantasy
of
men
who
can
not
view
you
quite
as
i
for
i
am
fond
and
willingly
mistake
my
book
to
be
the
book
i
meant
to
make
and
can
not
judge
you
for
that
phantom
sake
yet
pardon
me
if
i
have
wrought
too
ill
in
making
you
that
never
spared
the
will
to
shape
you
perfectly
and
lacked
the
skill
ah
had
i
but
the
power
my
book
then
i
had
wrought
in
you
some
wizardry
so
high
that
no
man
but
had
listened
they
pass
by
and
shrug
as
we
who
know
that
unto
us
it
has
been
granted
never
to
fare
thus
and
never
to
be
strong
and
glorious
is
it
denied
me
to
perpetuate
what
so
much
loving
labor
did
create
i
hear
oblivion
tap
upon
the
gate
and
acquiesce
not
all
disconsolate
for
i
have
got
such
recompense
of
that
excellence
which
the
contented
craftsman
knows
alone
that
to
loved
labor
goes
and
daily
does
the
work
he
chose
and
counts
all
else
