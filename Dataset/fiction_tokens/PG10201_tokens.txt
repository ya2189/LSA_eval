zane
grey
the
desert
of
wheat
chapter
i
late
in
june
the
vast
northwestern
desert
of
wheat
began
to
take
on
a
tinge
of
gold
lending
an
austere
beauty
to
that
endless
rolling
smooth
world
of
treeless
hills
where
miles
of
fallow
ground
and
miles
of
waving
grain
sloped
up
to
the
homes
of
the
heroic
men
who
had
conquered
over
sage
and
sand
these
simple
homes
of
farmers
seemed
lost
on
an
immensity
of
soft
gray
and
golden
billows
of
land
insignificant
dots
here
and
there
on
distant
hills
so
far
apart
that
nature
only
seemed
accountable
for
those
broad
squares
of
alternate
gold
and
brown
extending
on
and
on
to
the
waving
a
lonely
hard
heroic
country
where
flowers
and
fruit
were
not
nor
birds
and
brooks
nor
green
pastures
whirling
strings
of
dust
looped
up
over
fallow
ground
the
short
dry
wheat
lay
back
from
the
wind
the
haze
in
the
distance
was
drab
and
smoky
heavy
with
substance
a
thousand
hills
lay
bare
to
the
sky
and
half
of
every
hill
was
wheat
and
half
was
fallow
ground
and
all
of
them
with
the
shallow
valleys
between
seemed
big
and
strange
and
isolated
the
beauty
of
them
was
austere
as
if
the
hand
of
man
had
been
held
back
from
making
green
his
home
site
as
if
the
immensity
of
the
task
had
left
no
time
for
youth
and
freshness
years
long
years
were
there
in
the
gray
old
earth
and
the
wheat
looked
a
century
old
here
and
there
a
straight
dusty
road
stretched
from
hill
to
hill
becoming
a
thin
white
line
to
disappear
in
the
distance
the
sun
shone
hot
the
wind
blew
hard
and
over
the
boundless
undulating
expanse
hovered
a
shadow
that
was
neither
hood
of
dust
nor
hue
of
gold
it
was
not
physical
but
lonely
waiting
prophetic
and
weird
no
wild
desert
of
wastelands
once
the
home
of
other
races
of
man
and
now
gone
to
decay
and
death
could
have
shown
so
barren
an
acreage
half
of
this
wandering
patchwork
of
squares
was
earth
brown
and
gray
curried
and
disked
and
rolled
and
combed
and
harrowed
with
not
a
tiny
leaf
of
green
in
all
the
miles
the
other
half
had
only
a
faint
golden
promise
of
mellow
harvest
and
at
long
distance
it
seemed
to
shimmer
and
retreat
under
the
hot
sun
a
singularly
beautiful
effect
of
harmony
lay
in
the
long
slowly
rising
slopes
in
the
rounded
hills
in
the
endless
curving
lines
on
all
sides
the
scene
was
heroic
because
of
the
labor
of
horny
hands
it
was
sublime
because
not
a
hundred
harvests
nor
three
generations
of
toiling
men
could
ever
rob
nature
of
its
limitless
space
and
scorching
sun
and
sweeping
dust
of
its
resistless
creep
back
toward
the
desert
that
it
had
been
here
was
grown
the
most
bounteous
the
richest
and
finest
wheat
in
all
the
world
strange
and
unfathomable
that
so
much
of
the
bread
of
man
the
staff
of
life
the
hope
of
civilization
in
this
tragic
year
should
come
from
a
vast
treeless
waterless
dreary
desert
this
wonderful
place
was
an
immense
valley
of
considerable
altitude
called
the
columbia
basin
surrounded
by
the
cascade
mountains
on
the
west
the
coeur
and
bitter
root
mountains
on
the
east
the
okanozan
range
to
the
north
and
the
blue
mountains
to
the
south
the
valley
floor
was
basalt
from
the
lava
flow
of
volcanoes
in
ages
past
the
rainfall
was
slight
except
in
the
of
the
mountains
the
columbia
river
making
a
prodigious
and
meandering
curve
bordered
on
three
sides
what
was
known
as
the
bend
country
south
of
this
vast
area
across
the
range
began
the
fertile
region
that
extended
on
down
into
verdant
oregon
among
the
desert
hills
of
this
bend
country
near
the
center
of
the
basin
where
the
best
wheat
was
raised
lay
widely
separated
little
towns
the
names
of
which
gave
evidence
of
the
mixed
population
it
was
of
course
an
exceedingly
prosperous
country
a
fact
manifest
in
the
substantial
little
towns
if
not
in
the
crude
and
unpretentious
homes
of
the
farmers
the
acreage
of
farms
ran
from
a
section
six
hundred
and
forty
acres
up
into
the
thousands
upon
a
morning
in
early
july
exactly
three
months
after
the
united
states
had
declared
war
upon
germany
a
sturdy
young
farmer
strode
with
darkly
troubled
face
from
the
presence
of
his
father
at
the
end
of
a
stormy
scene
he
had
promised
his
father
that
he
would
abandon
his
desire
to
enlist
in
the
army
kurt
dorn
walked
away
from
the
gray
old
clapboard
house
out
to
the
fence
where
he
leaned
on
the
gate
he
could
see
for
miles
in
every
direction
and
to
the
southward
away
on
a
long
yellow
slope
rose
a
stream
of
dust
from
a
must
be
anderson
coming
to
dun
father
muttered
young
dorn
this
was
the
day
he
remembered
when
the
wealthy
rancher
of
ruxton
was
to
look
over
old
chris
dorn
dorn
owed
dollars
and
interest
for
years
mostly
to
anderson
kurt
hated
the
debt
and
resented
the
visit
but
he
could
not
help
acknowledging
that
the
rancher
had
been
lenient
and
kind
long
since
kurt
had
sorrowfully
realized
that
his
father
was
illiterate
hard
grasping
and
growing
worse
with
the
burden
of
years
if
we
had
rain
now
or
soon
that
section
of
bluestem
would
square
father
soliloquized
young
dorn
as
with
keen
eyes
he
surveyed
a
vast
field
of
wheat
short
smooth
yellowing
in
the
sun
but
the
cloudless
sky
the
haze
of
heat
rather
betokened
a
continued
drought
there
were
reasons
indeed
for
dorn
to
wear
a
dark
and
troubled
face
as
he
watched
the
speed
along
ahead
of
its
stream
of
dust
pass
out
of
sight
under
the
hill
and
soon
reappear
to
turn
off
the
main
road
and
come
toward
the
house
it
was
a
big
closed
car
covered
with
dust
the
driver
stopped
it
at
the
gate
and
got
out
is
this
chris
dorn
farm
he
asked
yes
replied
kurt
whereupon
the
door
of
the
car
opened
and
out
stepped
a
short
broad
man
in
a
long
linen
coat
come
out
lenore
an
shake
off
the
dust
he
said
and
he
assisted
a
young
woman
to
step
out
she
also
wore
a
long
linen
coat
and
a
veil
besides
the
man
removed
his
coat
and
threw
it
into
the
car
then
he
took
off
his
sombrero
to
beat
the
dust
off
of
that
phew
the
golden
valley
never
seen
dust
like
this
in
a
million
years
i
chokin
for
water
an
listen
to
the
car
she
boilin
then
as
he
stepped
toward
kurt
the
rancher
showed
himself
to
be
a
man
of
perhaps
of
powerful
form
beginning
to
sag
in
the
broad
shoulders
his
face
bronzed
by
long
exposure
to
wind
and
sun
he
had
keen
gray
eyes
and
their
look
was
that
of
a
man
used
to
dealing
with
his
kind
and
well
disposed
toward
them
hello
are
you
young
dorn
he
asked
yes
sir
replied
kurt
stepping
out
i
anderson
from
ruxton
come
to
see
your
dad
this
is
my
girl
lenore
kurt
acknowledged
the
slight
bow
from
the
veiled
young
woman
and
then
hesitating
he
added
wo
you
come
in
no
not
yet
i
chokin
for
air
an
water
bring
us
a
drink
replied
anderson
kurt
hurried
away
to
get
a
bucket
and
tin
cup
as
he
drew
water
from
the
well
he
was
thinking
rather
vaguely
that
it
was
somehow
embarrassing
the
fact
of
anderson
being
accompanied
by
his
daughter
kurt
was
afraid
of
his
father
but
then
what
did
it
matter
when
he
returned
to
the
yard
he
found
the
rancher
sitting
in
the
shade
of
one
of
the
few
and
the
young
lady
was
standing
near
in
the
act
of
removing
bonnet
and
veil
she
had
thrown
the
linen
coat
over
the
seat
of
an
old
that
lay
near
good
water
is
scarce
here
but
i
glad
we
have
some
said
kurt
then
as
he
set
down
the
bucket
and
offered
a
brimming
cupful
to
the
girl
he
saw
her
face
and
his
eyes
met
hers
he
dropped
the
cup
and
stared
then
hurriedly
with
flushing
face
he
bent
over
to
recover
and
refill
it
me
i
clumsy
he
managed
to
say
and
as
he
handed
the
cup
to
her
he
averted
his
gaze
for
more
than
a
year
the
memory
of
this
very
girl
had
haunted
him
he
had
seen
her
twice
the
first
time
at
the
close
of
his
one
year
of
college
at
the
university
of
california
and
the
second
time
on
the
street
in
spokane
in
a
glance
he
had
recognized
the
strong
lithe
figure
the
sunny
hair
the
rare
golden
tint
of
her
complexion
the
blue
eyes
warm
and
direct
and
he
had
sustained
a
shock
which
momentarily
confused
him
good
water
hey
dissented
anderson
after
drinking
a
second
cup
boy
that
wet
but
it
ai
water
to
drink
come
down
in
the
i
show
you
my
ranch
called
waters
an
you
ca
keep
your
feet
dry
i
wish
we
had
some
of
it
here
replied
kurt
wistfully
and
he
waved
a
hand
at
the
broad
swelling
slopes
the
warm
breath
that
blew
in
from
the
wheatlands
felt
dry
and
smelled
dry
you
in
for
a
dry
spell
inquired
anderson
with
interest
that
was
keen
and
kindly
as
well
father
says
so
and
i
fear
it
too
for
he
never
makes
a
mistake
in
weather
or
crops
a
hot
dry
spell
this
summer
hum
boy
do
you
know
that
wheat
is
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
you
mean
on
account
of
the
war
replied
kurt
yes
i
know
but
father
does
see
that
all
he
sees
is
if
we
have
rain
we
have
bumper
crops
that
big
field
there
would
be
a
record
at
war
prices
and
he
would
be
ruined
ruined
oh
he
means
i
close
on
him
hum
say
what
do
you
see
in
a
big
wheat
yield
if
it
rains
anderson
i
like
to
see
our
debt
paid
but
i
thinking
most
of
wheat
for
starving
peoples
i
i
studied
this
wheat
question
the
biggest
question
in
this
war
kurt
had
forgotten
the
girl
and
was
unaware
of
her
eyes
bent
steadily
upon
him
anderson
had
roused
to
the
interest
of
wheat
and
to
a
deeper
study
of
the
young
man
say
dorn
how
old
are
you
he
asked
and
kurt
my
first
name
was
the
reply
will
this
farm
fall
to
you
yes
if
my
father
does
not
lose
it
hum
old
dorn
wo
lose
it
never
fear
he
raises
the
best
wheat
in
this
section
but
father
never
owned
the
land
we
have
had
three
bad
years
if
the
wheat
fails
this
summer
we
lose
the
land
that
all
are
you
an
american
queried
anderson
slowly
as
if
treading
on
dangerous
ground
i
am
snapped
kurt

mother

american

german

replied
kurt
with
flashing
eyes
i
wanted
to
enlist

and
i
quarreled
over
that
until
i
had
to
give
in
he
hard
impossible

wait
for
the

and
hope
i

kurt
i

to
give
you
a
hunch

any
dealin
with
the
yes
last
harvest
we
had
trouble
but
nothing
serious
when
i
was
in
spokane
last
month
i
heard
a
good
deal
strangers
have
approached
us
here
too
mostly
aliens
i
have
no
use
for
them
but
they
always
get
father
ear
and
now
to
tell
the
truth
i
worried

to
be
replied
anderson
earnestly
we
all
worried
i
goin
to
let
you
read
over
the
laws
of
that
organization
you
to
keep
mum
now
mind
you
i
belong
to
the
chamber
of
commerce
in
spokane
somebody
got
hold
of
these
of
this
labor
union
we
had
copies
made
an
every
honest
farmer
in
the
northwest
is
goin
to
read
them
but
carryin
one
around
is
dangerous
i
reckon
these
days
here
anderson
hesitated
a
moment
peered
cautiously
around
and
then
slipping
folded
sheets
of
paper
from
his
inside
coat
pocket
he
evidently
made
ready
to
hand
them
to
kurt
lenore
where
the
driver
he
asked
he
under
the
car
replied
the
girl
kurt
thrilled
at
the
soft
sound
of
her
voice
it
was
something
to
have
been
haunted
by
a
girl
face
for
a
year
and
then
suddenly
hear
her
voice
he
new
to
me
that
driver
an
i
ai
trustin
any
new
men
these
days
went
on
anderson
here
now
dorn
read
that
an
if
you
get
without
finishing
his
last
muttered
remark
he
opened
the
sheets
of
manuscript
and
spread
them
out
to
the
young
man
curiously
and
with
a
little
rush
of
excitement
kurt
began
to
read
the
very
first
rule
of
the
aimed
to
abolish
capital
kurt
read
on
with
slowly
growing
amaze
consternation
and
anger
when
he
had
finished
his
look
without
speech
was
a
question
anderson
hastened
to
answer
it
straight
goods
he
declared
them
the
rules
of
that
gang
we
made
certain
before
we
acted
now
how
do
they
strike
you
why
that
no
labor
union
replied
kurt
hotly
they
outlaws
thieves
blackmailers
pirates
i
i
do
know
what
dorn
we
up
against
a
bad
outfit
an
the
northwest
will
see
hell
this
summer
there
trouble
in
montana
and
idaho
strangers
are
driftin
into
washington
from
all
over
we
must
organize
to
meet
them
to
prevent
them
gettin
a
hold
out
here
it
a
labor
union
mostly
aliens
with
dishonest
an
unscrupulous
leaders
some
of
them
americans
they
aim
to
take
advantage
of
the
war
situation
in
the
newspapers
they
rave
about
shorter
hours
more
pay
acknowledgment
of
the
union
but
any
fool
would
see
if
he
read
them
laws
i
showed
you
that
this
is
not
straight
anderson
what
steps
have
you
taken
down
in
your
country
queried
kurt
so
far
all
i
done
was
to
hire
my
hands
for
a
year
give
them
high
wages
an
caution
them
when
strangers
come
round
to
feed
them
an
be
civil
an
send
them
on
but
we
ca
do
that
up
here
in
the
bend
said
dorn
seriously
we
need
say
a
hundred
thousand
men
in
and
not
ten
thousand
all
the
rest
of
the
year
sure
you
ca
but
you
have
to
organize
somethin
up
here
in
this
desert
you
could
have
a
heap
of
trouble
if
that
outfit
got
here
strong
enough
you
better
tell
every
farmer
you
can
trust
about
this
i
only
one
american
neighbor
and
he
lives
six
miles
from
here
replied
dorn
olsen
over
there
is
a
swede
and
not
a
naturalized
citizen
but
i
believe
he
for
the
and
there
dad
interrupted
the
girl
i
believe
our
driver
is
listening
to
your
very
uninteresting
conversation
she
spoke
demurely
with
laughter
in
her
low
voice
it
made
dorn
dare
to
look
at
her
and
he
met
a
blue
blaze
that
was
instantly
averted
anderson
growled
evidently
some
very
hard
names
under
his
breath
his
look
just
then
was
full
of
characteristic
western
spirit
then
he
got
up
lenore
i
reckon
your
talk
be
more
interesting
than
mine
he
said
dryly
i
go
see
dorn
an
get
this
business
over
i
rather
go
with
you
hurriedly
replied
kurt
and
then
as
though
realizing
a
seeming
discourtesy
in
his
words
his
face
flamed
and
he
stammered
i
i
do
mean
that
but
father
is
in
bad
mood
we
just
i
told
you
about
the
war
and
anderson
i
i
a
little
afraid
he
well
son
i
not
afraid
interrupted
the
rancher
i
beard
the
old
lion
in
his
den
you
talk
to
lenore
please
do
speak
of
the
war
said
kurt
appealingly
not
a
word
unless
he
starts
roarin
at
uncle
sam
declared
anderson
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
and
turned
toward
the
house
he
roar
all
right
said
kurt
almost
with
a
groan
he
knew
what
an
ordeal
awaited
the
rancher
and
he
hated
the
fact
that
it
could
not
be
avoided
then
kurt
was
confused
astounded
infuriated
with
himself
over
a
situation
he
had
not
brought
about
and
could
scarcely
realize
he
became
conscious
of
pride
and
shame
and
something
as
black
and
hopeless
as
despair
have
i
seen
you
before
asked
the
girl
the
query
surprised
and
thrilled
kurt
out
of
his
thought
i
do
know
have
you
where
he
answered
facing
her
it
was
a
relief
to
find
that
she
still
averted
her
face
at
berkeley
in
california
the
first
time
and
the
second
at
spokane
in
front
of
the
davenport
she
replied
first
and
second
you
you
remembered
both
times
he
burst
out
incredulously
yes
i
do
see
how
i
could
have
helped
remembering
her
laugh
was
low
musical
a
little
hurried
yet
cool
dorn
was
not
familiar
with
girls
he
had
worked
hard
all
his
life
there
among
those
desert
hills
and
during
the
few
years
his
father
had
allowed
him
for
education
he
knew
wheat
but
nothing
of
the
eternal
feminine
so
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
grasp
that
this
girl
was
not
wholly
at
her
ease
her
words
and
the
cool
little
laugh
suddenly
brought
home
to
kurt
the
immeasurable
distance
between
him
and
a
daughter
of
one
of
the
richest
ranchers
in
washington
you
mean
i
i
was
impertinent
he
began
struggling
between
shame
and
pride
i
i
stared
at
you
oh
i
must
have
been
rude
but
miss
anderson
i
i
did
mean
to
be
i
did
think
you
saw
me
at
all
i
do
know
what
made
me
do
that
it
never
happened
before
i
beg
your
pardon
a
subtle
indefinable
change
perceptible
to
dorn
even
in
his
confused
state
came
over
the
girl
i
did
not
say
you
were
impertinent
she
returned
i
remembered
seeing
you
notice
me
that
is
all
aloof
and
kind
miss
anderson
now
became
an
impenetrable
mystery
to
dorn
but
that
only
accentuated
the
distance
she
had
intimated
lay
between
them
her
kindness
stung
him
to
recover
his
composure
he
wished
she
had
not
been
kind
what
a
singular
chance
that
had
brought
her
here
to
his
home
the
daughter
of
a
man
who
came
to
demand
a
debt
what
a
dispelling
of
the
vague
thing
that
had
been
only
a
dream
dorn
gazed
away
across
the
yellowing
hills
to
the
dim
blue
of
the
mountains
where
rolled
the
oregon
despite
the
color
it
was
gray
like
his
future
i
heard
you
tell
father
you
had
studied
wheat
said
the
girl
presently
evidently
trying
to
make
conversation
yes
all
my
life
replied
kurt
my
study
has
mostly
been
under
my
father
look
at
my
hands
he
held
out
big
strong
hands
scarred
and
knotted
with
horny
palms
uppermost
and
he
laughed
i
can
be
proud
of
them
miss
anderson
but
i
had
a
splendid
year
in
california
at
the
university
and
i
graduated
from
the
washington
state
agricultural
college
you
love
wheat
the
raising
of
it
i
mean
she
inquired
it
must
be
that
i
do
though
i
never
had
such
a
thought
wheat
is
so
wonderful
no
one
can
guess
who
does
not
know
it
the
clean
plump
grain
the
sowing
on
fallow
ground
the
long
wait
the
first
tender
green
and
the
change
day
by
day
to
the
deep
waving
fields
of
gold
then
the
harvest
hot
noisy
smoky
full
of
dust
and
chaff
and
the
great
with
horses
oh
i
guess
i
do
love
it
all
i
worked
in
a
spokane
too
just
to
learn
how
flour
is
made
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
so
white
so
clean
so
pure
as
flour
made
from
the
wheat
of
these
hills
next
you
be
telling
me
that
you
can
bake
bread
she
rejoined
and
her
laugh
was
low
and
sweet
her
eyes
shone
with
soft
blue
gleams
indeed
i
can
i
bake
all
the
bread
we
use
he
said
stoutly
and
i
flatter
myself
i
can
beat
any
girl
you
know
you
can
beat
mine
i
sure
before
i
went
to
college
i
did
pretty
well
but
i
learned
too
much
there
now
my
mother
and
sisters
and
brother
jim
all
the
family
except
dad
make
fun
of
my
bread
you
have
a
brother
how
old
is
he
one
brother
jim
we
call
him
he
he
is
just
past
she
faltered
the
last
few
words
kurt
felt
on
common
ground
with
her
then
the
sudden
break
in
her
voice
the
change
in
her
face
the
shadowing
of
the
blue
eyes
these
were
eloquent
oh
it
horrible
this
need
of
war
she
exclaimed
yes
he
replied
simply
but
maybe
your
brother
will
not
be
called
called
why
he
refused
to
wait
for
the
draft
he
went
and
enlisted
dad
patted
him
on
the
back
if
anything
happens
to
him
it
kill
my
mother
jim
is
her
idol
it
break
my
heart
oh
i
hate
the
very
name
of
germans
my
father
is
german
said
kurt
he
been
fifty
years
in
america
eighteen
years
here
on
this
farm
he
always
hated
england
now
he
bitter
against
america
i
can
see
a
side
you
ca
see
but
i
do
blame
you
for
what
you
said
forgive
me
i
ca
conceive
of
meaning
that
against
any
one
lived
here
so
long
oh
it
must
be
hard
for
you
i
let
my
father
think
i
forced
to
join
the
army
but
i
going
to
fight
against
his
people
we
are
a
house
divided
against
itself
oh
what
a
pity
the
girl
sighed
and
her
eyes
were
dark
with
brooding
sorrow
a
step
sounded
behind
them
anderson
appeared
sombrero
off
mopping
a
very
red
face
his
eyes
gleamed
with
angry
glints
his
mouth
and
chin
were
working
he
flopped
down
with
a
great
explosive
breath
kurt
your
old
man
is
a
a
son
of
a
gun
he
exclaimed
vociferously
manifestly
liberation
of
speech
was
a
relief
the
young
man
nodded
seriously
and
knowingly
i
hope
sir
he
he
he
did
you
just
bet
your
life
he
called
me
a
lot
in
german
but
i
know
cuss
words
when
i
hear
them
i
tried
to
reason
with
him
told
him
i
wanted
my
money
was
here
to
help
him
get
that
money
off
the
farm
some
way
or
other
an
he
swore
i
was
a
capitalist
an
enemy
to
labor
an
the
northwest
that
i
an
my
kind
had
caused
the
war
kurt
gazed
gravely
into
the
disturbed
face
of
the
rancher
miss
anderson
had
eyes
of
wonder
sure
i
could
have
stood
all
that
went
on
anderson
fuming
but
he
ordered
me
out
of
the
house
i
got
mad
an
would
go
then
by
george
he
pulled
my
nose
an
called
me
a
bloody
englishman
kurt
groaned
in
the
disgrace
of
the
moment
but
amazingly
miss
anderson
burst
into
a
silvery
peal
of
laughter
oh
dad
that
just
too
good
for
anything
you
met
your
match
at
last
you
know
you
always
boasted
of
your
drop
of
english
blood
and
you
sensitive
about
your
big
nose
he
must
be
over
seventy
growled
anderson
as
if
seeking
for
some
excuse
to
palliate
his
restraint
i
mad
but
it
was
funny
the
working
of
his
face
finally
set
in
the
huge
wrinkles
of
a
laugh
young
dorn
struggled
to
repress
his
own
mirth
but
unguardedly
he
happened
to
meet
the
dancing
blue
eyes
of
the
girl
merry
provocative
full
of
youth
and
fun
and
that
was
too
much
for
him
he
laughed
with
them
the
joke
on
me
said
anderson
an
i
can
take
one
now
young
man
i
think
i
gathered
from
your
amiable
dad
that
if
the
crop
of
wheat
was
full
i
get
my
money
otherwise
i
could
take
over
the
land
for
my
part
i
never
do
that
but
the
others
interested
might
do
it
even
for
the
little
money
involved
i
tried
to
buy
them
out
so
i
have
the
whole
mortgage
they
would
not
sell
anderson
you
a
square
man
and
i
do
declared
kurt
come
out
an
show
me
the
wheat
interrupted
anderson
lenore
do
you
want
to
go
with
us
i
do
replied
the
daughter
and
she
took
up
her
hat
to
put
it
on
kurt
led
them
through
the
yard
out
past
the
old
barn
to
the
edge
of
the
open
slope
where
the
wheat
stretched
away
down
and
up
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
chapter
ii
we
got
over
sixteen
hundred
acres
in
fallow
ground
a
in
rye
another
half
in
wheat
turkey
red
and
this
section
you
see
six
hundred
and
forty
acres
in
bluestem
said
kurt
anderson
keen
eyes
swept
from
near
at
hand
to
far
away
down
the
gentle
billowy
slope
and
up
the
far
hillside
the
wheat
was
two
feet
high
beginning
to
be
thick
and
heavy
at
the
heads
as
if
struggling
to
burst
a
fragrant
dry
wheaty
smell
mingled
with
dust
came
on
the
soft
summer
breeze
and
a
faint
silken
rustle
the
greenish
almost
blue
color
near
at
hand
gradually
in
the
distance
grew
lighter
and
then
yellow
and
finally
took
on
a
tinge
of
gold
there
was
a
living
spirit
in
that
vast
dorn
it
the
finest
wheat
i
seen
exclaimed
anderson
with
the
admiration
of
the
farmer
who
aspired
high
in
fact
it
the
only
fine
field
of
wheat
i
seen
since
we
left
the
how
is
that
late
spring
and
dry
weather
replied
dorn
most
of
the
reports
are
poor
if
we
get
rain
over
the
bend
country
we
have
only
an
average
yield
this
year
if
we
do
get
rain
then
flat
failure
miss
anderson
evinced
an
interest
in
the
subject
and
she
wanted
to
know
why
this
particular
field
identical
with
all
the
others
for
miles
around
should
have
a
promise
of
a
magnificent
crop
when
the
others
had
no
promise
at
all
this
section
lay
fallow
a
long
time
replied
dorn
snow
lasted
here
on
this
north
slope
quite
a
while
my
father
used
a
method
of
soil
cultivation
intended
to
conserve
moisture
the
seed
wheat
was
especially
selected
and
if
we
have
rain
during
the
next
ten
days
this
section
of
bluestem
will
yield
fifty
bushels
to
the
acre
fifty
bushels
ejaculated
anderson
bluestem
why
do
you
call
it
that
when
it
green
and
yellow
queried
the
girl
it
a
name
there
are
many
varieties
of
wheat
bluestem
is
best
here
in
this
desert
country
because
it
resists
drought
it
produces
large
yield
it
does
not
break
and
the
rate
it
very
high
bluestem
is
not
good
in
wet
soils
anderson
tramped
along
the
edge
of
the
field
peering
down
here
and
there
pulling
a
shaft
of
wheat
and
examining
it
the
girl
gazed
with
dreamy
eyes
across
the
undulating
sea
and
dorn
watched
her
we
have
a
ranch
thousands
of
acres
but
not
like
this
she
said
what
the
difference
asked
dorn
she
appeared
pensive
and
in
doubt
i
hardly
know
what
would
you
call
this
this
scene
why
i
call
it
the
desert
of
wheat
but
no
one
else
does
he
replied
i
named
father
ranch
waters
i
think
those
names
tell
the
difference
is
my
desert
beautiful
no
it
has
a
sameness
a
monotony
that
would
drive
me
mad
it
looks
as
if
the
whole
world
had
gone
to
wheat
it
makes
me
think
oppresses
me
all
this
means
that
we
live
by
wheat
alone
these
bare
hills
too
open
to
wind
and
sun
and
snow
they
look
like
the
toil
of
ages
miss
anderson
there
is
such
a
thing
as
love
for
the
earth
the
bare
brown
earth
you
know
we
came
from
dust
and
to
dust
we
return
these
fields
are
human
to
my
father
and
they
have
come
to
speak
to
me
a
language
i
do
understand
yet
but
i
mean
what
you
see
the
growing
wheat
here
the
field
of
clods
over
there
the
wind
and
dust
and
glare
and
heat
the
eternal
sameness
of
the
open
space
these
are
the
things
around
which
my
life
has
centered
and
when
i
go
away
from
them
i
am
not
content
anderson
came
back
to
the
young
couple
carrying
some
heads
of
wheat
in
his
hand
smut
he
exclaimed
showing
both
diseased
and
healthy
specimens
of
wheat
had
to
hunt
hard
to
find
that
smut
is
the
bane
of
all
i
never
saw
so
little
of
it
as
there
is
here
in
fact
we
know
scarcely
nothin
about
smut
an
its
cure
if
there
is
any
you
farmers
who
raise
only
grain
have
got
the
work
down
to
a
science
this
bluestem
is
not
bearded
wheat
like
turkey
red
has
that
beard
to
do
with
smut
i
think
not
the
parasite
or
fungus
lives
inside
the
wheat
never
heard
that
before
no
wonder
smut
is
the
worst
trouble
for
in
the
northwest
i
fields
literally
full
of
smut
we
never
are
rid
of
it
one
farmer
has
one
idea
an
some
one
else
another
what
could
be
of
greater
importance
to
a
farmer
we
at
war
the
men
who
claim
to
know
say
that
wheat
will
win
the
war
an
we
lose
millions
of
bushels
from
this
smut
that
to
say
it
a
terrible
fact
to
face
i
like
to
get
your
ideas
dorn
happening
to
glance
again
at
miss
anderson
an
act
that
seemed
to
be
growing
habitual
read
curiosity
and
interest
and
something
more
in
her
direct
blue
eyes
the
circumstance
embarrassed
him
though
it
tugged
at
the
of
his
knowledge
he
could
talk
about
wheat
and
he
did
like
to
yet
here
was
a
girl
who
might
be
supposed
to
be
bored
still
she
did
not
appear
to
be
that
warm
glance
was
not
politeness
yes
i
like
to
hear
every
word
you
can
say
about
wheat
she
said
with
an
encouraging
little
nod
sure
she
would
added
anderson
with
an
affectionate
hand
on
her
shoulder
she
a
farmer
daughter
she
be
a
farmer
wife
he
laughed
at
this
last
sally
the
girl
blushed
dorn
smiled
and
shook
his
head
doubtfully
i
imagine
that
good
fortune
will
never
befall
a
farmer
he
said
well
if
it
should
she
replied
archly
just
consider
how
i
might
surprise
him
with
my
knowledge
of
wheat
indeed
dorn
i
am
interested
i
never
been
in
the
bend
before
in
your
desert
of
wheat
i
never
before
felt
the
greatness
of
loving
the
soil
or
caring
for
it
of
growing
things
from
seed
yet
the
bible
teaches
that
and
i
read
my
bible
please
tell
us
the
more
you
say
the
more
i
like
it
dorn
was
not
proof
against
this
eloquence
and
he
quoted
two
of
his
authorities
heald
and
woolman
of
the
state
agricultural
experiment
station
where
he
had
studied
for
two
years
bunt
or
stinking
smut
is
caused
by
two
different
species
of
microscopic
fungi
which
live
as
parasites
in
the
wheat
plant
both
are
essentially
similar
in
their
effects
and
their
or
the
variety
is
the
common
stinking
smut
of
the
pacific
regions
while
or
the
species
is
the
one
generally
found
in
the
eastern
united
states
the
smut
or
from
an
infected
head
contain
millions
of
minute
bodies
the
spores
or
of
the
smut
fungus
these
reproduce
the
smut
in
somewhat
the
same
way
that
a
true
seed
develops
into
a
new
plant
a
single
smut
ball
of
average
size
contains
a
sufficient
number
of
spores
to
give
one
for
each
grain
of
wheat
in
five
or
six
bushels
it
takes
eight
smut
spores
to
equal
the
diameter
of
a
human
hair
normal
wheat
grains
from
an
infected
field
may
have
so
many
spores
lodged
on
their
surface
as
to
give
them
a
dark
color
but
other
grains
which
show
no
difference
in
color
to
the
naked
eye
may
still
contain
a
sufficient
number
of
spores
to
produce
a
smutty
crop
if
seed
treatment
is
not
practised
when
living
smut
spores
are
introduced
into
the
soil
with
the
seed
wheat
or
exist
in
the
soil
in
which
wheat
is
sown
a
certain
percentage
of
the
wheat
plants
are
likely
to
become
infected
the
smut
spore
germinates
and
produces
first
a
stage
of
the
smut
plant
in
the
soil
this
first
stage
never
infects
a
young
seedling
direct
but
gives
rise
to
secondary
spores
or
sporida
from
which
infection
threads
may
arise
and
penetrate
the
shoot
of
a
young
seedling
and
reach
the
growing
point
here
the
fungus
threads
keep
pace
with
the
growth
of
the
plant
and
reach
maturity
at
or
slightly
before
since
this
disease
is
caused
by
an
internal
parasite
it
is
natural
to
expect
certain
responses
to
its
presence
it
should
be
noted
first
that
the
smut
fungus
is
living
at
the
expense
of
its
host
plant
the
wheat
and
its
effect
on
the
host
may
be
summarized
as
follows
the
consumption
of
food
the
destruction
of
food
in
the
sporulating
process
and
the
stimulating
or
retarding
effect
on
normal
physiological
processes
badly
smutted
plants
remain
in
many
cases
and
produce
fewer
and
smaller
heads
in
the
fife
and
bluestem
varieties
the
infected
heads
previous
to
maturity
exhibit
a
darker
green
color
and
remain
green
longer
than
the
normal
heads
in
some
varieties
the
infected
heads
stand
erect
when
normal
ones
begin
to
droop
as
a
result
of
the
increasing
weight
of
the
ripening
grain
a
crop
may
become
infected
with
smut
in
a
number
of
different
ways
smut
was
originally
introduced
with
the
seed
and
many
farmers
are
still
planting
it
every
season
with
their
seed
wheat
wheat
taken
from
a
smutty
crop
will
have
countless
numbers
of
loose
spores
adhering
to
the
grains
also
a
certain
number
of
unbroken
smut
balls
these
are
always
a
source
of
danger
even
when
the
seed
is
treated
with
fungicides
before
sowing
there
are
also
chances
for
the
infection
of
a
crop
if
absolutely
seed
is
employed
first
soil
infection
from
a
previous
smutty
crop
second
soil
infection
from
spores
experiments
have
shown
that
separated
spores
from
crushed
smut
balls
lose
their
effective
power
in
from
two
to
three
months
provided
the
soil
is
moist
and
loose
and
in
no
case
do
they
survive
a
winter
it
does
not
seem
probable
that
wheat
smut
will
be
controlled
by
any
single
practice
but
rather
by
the
combined
use
of
various
methods
crop
rotation
the
use
of
clean
seed
seed
treatment
with
fungicides
cultural
practices
and
breeding
and
selection
of
varieties
failure
to
practise
crop
rotation
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
main
explanations
for
the
general
prevalence
of
smut
in
the
of
eastern
washington
even
with
an
intervening
summer
fallow
the
smut
from
a
previous
crop
may
be
a
source
of
infection
experience
shows
that
a
fall
stubble
crop
is
less
liable
to
smut
infection
than
a
crop
following
summer
fallow
the
apparent
explanation
for
this
condition
is
the
fact
that
the
summer
fallow
becomes
infected
with
spores
while
in
a
stubble
crop
the
spores
as
well
as
those
originating
from
the
previous
crop
are
buried
in
plowing
if
clean
seed
or
properly
treated
seed
had
been
used
by
all
farmers
we
should
never
have
had
a
smut
problem
high
per
cents
of
smut
indicate
either
soil
infection
or
imperfect
treatment
the
principle
of
the
chemical
treatment
is
to
use
a
poison
which
will
kill
the
superficial
spores
of
the
smut
and
not
materially
injure
the
germinating
power
of
the
seed
the
treatment
is
only
recommended
when
one
of
the
chemical
is
not
effective
certain
cultural
practices
are
beneficial
in
reducing
the
amount
of
smut
in
all
cases
while
the
value
of
others
depends
to
some
extent
upon
the
source
of
the
smut
spores
the
factors
which
always
influence
the
amount
of
smut
are
the
temperature
of
the
soil
during
the
germinating
period
the
amount
of
soil
moisture
and
the
depth
of
seeding
where
spores
are
the
only
sources
of
infection
attention
to
the
three
factors
mentioned
will
give
the
only
cultural
practices
for
reducing
the
amount
of
smut
early
seeding
has
been
practised
by
various
farmers
and
they
report
a
marked
reduction
in
smut
the
replowing
of
the
summer
fallow
after
the
first
fall
rains
is
generally
effective
in
reducing
the
amount
of
smut
very
late
planting
that
is
four
or
five
weeks
after
the
first
good
fall
rains
is
also
an
effective
practice
fall
tillage
of
summer
fallow
other
than
plowing
seems
to
be
beneficial
no
varieties
of
wheat
are
known
but
the
standard
varieties
show
varying
degrees
of
resistance
spring
wheats
generally
suffer
less
from
smut
than
winter
varieties
this
is
not
due
to
any
superior
resistance
but
rather
to
the
fact
that
they
escape
infection
if
only
spring
wheats
were
grown
our
smut
problem
would
largely
disappear
but
a
return
to
this
practice
is
not
suggested
since
the
winter
wheats
are
much
more
desirable
it
seems
probable
that
the
conditions
which
prevail
during
the
growing
season
may
have
considerable
influence
on
the
per
cent
of
smut
in
any
given
variety
when
dorn
finished
his
discourse
to
receive
the
thanks
of
his
listeners
they
walked
back
through
the
yard
toward
the
road
anderson
who
led
the
way
halted
rather
abruptly
hum
who
those
men
talkin
to
my
driver
he
queried
dorn
then
saw
a
couple
of
strangers
standing
near
the
engaged
in
apparently
close
conversation
with
the
chauffeur
upon
the
moment
they
glanced
up
to
see
anderson
approaching
and
they
rather
hurriedly
departed
dorn
had
noted
a
good
many
strangers
lately
men
whose
garb
was
not
that
of
farmers
whose
faces
seemed
foreign
whose
actions
were
suspicious
i
bet
a
hundred
they
declared
anderson
take
my
hunch
dorn
the
strangers
passed
on
down
the
road
without
looking
back
wonder
where
they
sleep
muttered
dorn
anderson
rather
sharply
asked
his
driver
what
the
two
men
wanted
and
the
reply
he
got
was
that
they
were
inquiring
about
work
did
they
speak
english
went
on
the
rancher
well
enough
to
make
themselves
understood
replied
the
driver
dorn
did
not
get
a
good
impression
from
the
shifty
eyes
and
air
of
taciturnity
of
anderson
man
and
it
was
evident
that
the
blunt
rancher
restrained
himself
he
helped
his
daughter
into
the
car
and
then
put
on
his
long
coat
next
he
shook
hands
with
dorn
young
man
i
enjoyed
meetin
you
an
have
sure
profited
from
same
he
said
which
makes
up
for
your
dad
i
run
over
here
again
to
see
you
around
an
i
be
wishin
for
that
rain
thank
you
if
it
does
rain
i
be
happy
to
see
you
replied
dorn
with
a
smile
well
if
it
does
rain
i
wo
come
i
put
it
off
another
year
an
cuss
them
other
fellers
into
holdin
off
too
you
very
kind
i
do
know
how
i
we
ever
repay
you
in
that
case
do
mention
it
say
how
far
did
you
say
it
was
to
palmer
we
have
lunch
there
it
fifteen
miles
that
way
answered
dorn
if
it
was
for
for
father
i
like
you
to
stay
and
break
some
of
my
bread
dorn
was
looking
at
the
girl
as
he
spoke
her
steady
gaze
had
been
on
him
ever
since
she
entered
the
car
and
in
the
shade
of
her
hat
and
the
veil
she
was
adjusting
her
eyes
seemed
very
dark
and
sweet
and
thoughtful
she
brightly
nodded
her
thanks
as
she
held
the
veil
aside
with
both
hands
i
wish
you
luck
she
said
and
closed
the
veil
still
dorn
could
see
her
eyes
through
it
and
now
they
were
sweeter
more
mysterious
more
provocative
of
haunting
thoughts
it
flashed
over
him
with
dread
certainty
that
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
the
shock
struck
him
mute
he
had
no
reply
for
the
rancher
hearty
farewell
then
the
car
lurched
away
and
dust
rose
in
a
cloud
chapter
iii
with
a
strange
knocking
of
his
heart
high
up
toward
his
throat
kurt
dorn
stood
watching
the
moving
cloud
of
dust
until
it
disappeared
over
the
hill
no
doubt
entered
his
mind
the
truth
the
fact
was
a
year
old
a
and
dreamy
state
but
its
meaning
had
not
been
revealed
to
him
until
just
a
moment
past
everything
had
changed
when
she
looked
out
with
that
sweet
steady
gaze
through
the
parted
veil
and
then
slowly
closed
it
she
had
changed
there
was
something
intangible
about
her
that
last
moment
baffling
haunting
he
leaned
against
a
crooked
old
that
as
a
boy
he
had
climbed
and
the
thought
came
to
him
that
this
spot
would
all
his
life
be
vivid
and
poignant
in
his
memory
the
first
sight
of
a
girl
a
year
and
more
before
had
struck
deep
into
his
unconscious
heart
a
second
sight
had
made
her
an
unforgettable
reality
and
a
third
had
been
the
realization
of
love
it
was
sad
regrettable
incomprehensible
and
yet
somehow
his
inner
being
swelled
and
throbbed
her
name
was
lenore
anderson
her
father
was
one
of
the
richest
men
in
the
state
of
washington
she
had
one
brother
jim
who
would
not
wait
for
the
army
draft
kurt
trembled
and
a
hot
rush
of
tears
dimmed
his
eyes
all
at
once
his
lot
seemed
unbearable
an
immeasurable
barrier
had
arisen
between
him
and
his
old
father
a
hideous
thing
of
blood
of
years
of
ineradicable
difference
the
broad
acres
of
wheatland
so
dear
to
him
were
to
be
taken
from
him
love
had
overcome
him
with
headlong
rush
a
love
that
could
never
be
returned
and
cruelest
of
all
there
was
the
war
calling
him
to
give
up
his
home
his
father
his
future
and
to
go
out
to
kill
and
to
be
killed
it
came
to
him
while
he
leaned
there
that
remembering
the
light
of
lenore
anderson
eyes
he
could
not
give
up
to
bitterness
and
hatred
whatever
his
misfortunes
and
his
fate
she
would
never
be
anything
to
him
but
he
and
her
brother
jim
and
many
other
young
americans
must
be
incalculable
all
to
her
that
thought
saved
kurt
dorn
there
were
other
things
besides
his
own
career
his
happiness
and
the
way
he
was
placed
however
unfortunate
from
a
selfish
point
of
view
must
not
breed
a
morbid
the
moment
of
his
resolution
brought
a
flash
a
revelation
of
what
he
owed
himself
the
work
and
the
thought
and
the
feeling
of
his
last
few
weeks
there
at
home
must
be
intensified
he
must
do
much
and
live
greatly
in
little
time
this
was
the
moment
of
his
renunciation
and
he
imagined
that
many
a
young
man
who
had
decided
to
go
to
war
had
experienced
a
strange
spiritual
division
of
self
he
wondered
also
if
that
moment
was
not
for
many
of
them
a
a
throwing
up
of
ideals
a
helpless
retrograding
and
surrender
to
the
brutalizing
spirit
of
war
but
it
could
never
be
so
for
him
it
might
have
been
had
not
that
girl
come
into
his
life
the
bell
for
the
midday
meal
roused
kurt
from
his
profound
reverie
and
he
plodded
back
to
the
house
down
through
the
barnyard
gate
he
saw
the
hired
men
coming
and
a
second
glance
discovered
to
him
that
two
unknown
men
were
with
them
watching
for
a
moment
kurt
recognized
the
two
strangers
that
had
been
talking
to
anderson
driver
they
seemed
to
be
talking
earnestly
now
kurt
saw
jerry
a
trusty
and
employee
rather
unceremoniously
break
away
from
these
strangers
but
they
followed
him
headed
him
off
and
with
vehement
nods
and
gesticulations
appeared
to
be
arguing
with
him
the
other
hired
men
pushed
closer
evidently
listening
finally
jerry
impatiently
broke
away
and
tramped
toward
the
house
these
strangers
sent
sharp
words
after
him
words
that
kurt
could
not
distinguish
though
he
caught
the
tone
of
scorn
then
the
two
individuals
addressed
themselves
to
the
other
men
and
in
close
contact
the
whole
party
passed
out
of
sight
behind
the
barn
thoughtfully
kurt
went
into
the
house
he
meant
to
speak
to
jerry
about
the
strangers
but
he
wanted
to
consider
the
matter
first
he
had
misgivings
his
father
was
not
in
the
nor
in
the
kitchen
dinner
was
ready
on
the
table
and
the
one
servant
an
old
woman
who
had
served
the
dorns
for
years
appeared
impatient
at
the
lack
of
promptness
in
the
men
both
father
and
son
except
on
sundays
always
ate
with
the
hired
help
kurt
stepped
outside
to
find
jerry
washing
at
the
bench
jerry
what
keeping
the
men
queried
kurt
wal
they
palaverin
out
there
with
two
fellers
replied
jerry
kurt
reached
for
the
rope
of
the
and
rang
it
rather
sharply
then
he
went
in
to
take
his
place
at
the
table
and
jerry
soon
followed
old
man
dorn
did
not
appear
which
fact
was
not
unusual
the
other
hired
men
did
not
enter
until
jerry
and
kurt
were
half
done
with
the
meal
they
seemed
excited
and
somewhat
boisterous
kurt
thought
but
once
they
settled
down
to
eating
after
the
manner
of
hungry
laborers
they
had
little
to
say
kurt
soon
finishing
his
dinner
went
outdoors
to
wait
for
jerry
that
individual
appeared
to
be
long
in
coming
and
loud
voices
in
the
kitchen
attested
to
further
argument
at
last
however
he
lounged
out
and
began
to
fill
a
pipe
jerry
i
want
to
talk
to
you
said
kurt
let
get
away
from
the
house
the
hired
man
was
a
big
lumbering
fellow
gnarled
like
an
old
he
had
a
face
and
honest
eyes
i
reckon
you
want
to
hear
about
them
fellers
he
asked
as
they
walked
away
yes
replied
kurt
there
been
a
regular
procession
of
them
fellers
the
last
week
or
so
walkin
through
the
country
replied
jerry
the
first
time
any
of
them
got
to
me
but
i
heerd
talk
sunday
when
i
was
in
palmer
the
air
was
full
of
rumors
rumors
of
what
queried
kurt
all
kinds
answered
jerry
nonchalantly
scratching
his
stubby
beard
there
an
army
of
comin
in
from
eastward
idaho
an
montana
are
gittin
a
dose
now
short
hours
double
wages
join
the
union
sabotage
whatever
thet
is
capital
an
labor
fight
threats
if
you
do
fall
in
line
an
lord
knows
what
all
what
did
those
two
fellows
want
of
you
wanted
us
to
join
the
replied
the
laborer
did
they
want
a
job
not
as
i
heerd
why
one
of
them
had
a
wad
of
bills
thet
would
choke
a
cow
he
did
most
of
the
talkin
the
little
feller
with
the
beady
eyes
an
the
he
did
say
much
he
austrian
an
not
long
in
this
country
the
big
stiff
glidden
he
called
himself
must
be
some
shucks
in
thet
he
looked
an
talked
oily
at
first
very
persuadin
but
when
i
says
i
was
goin
to
join
no
union
he
got
sassy
an
bossy
they
made
me
sore
so
i
told
him
to
go
to
hell
then
he
said
the
would
run
the
whole
northwest
this
summer
lumberin
railroadin
the
whole
kaboodle
an
thet
any
workman
who
would
join
would
git
his
all
right
well
jerry
what
do
you
think
about
this
organization
queried
kurt
anxiously
not
much
it
ai
a
square
deal
i
ai
got
no
belief
in
them
what
i
heerd
of
their
threatenin
methods
is
like
the
way
this
glidden
talks
if
i
owned
a
farm
i
drive
such
fellers
off
with
a
whip
there
to
be
bad
doin
if
they
come
driftin
strong
into
the
bend
jerry
are
you
satisfied
with
your
job
sure
i
wo
join
the
an
i
talk
it
i
reckon
a
few
of
us
will
hev
to
do
all
the
harvestin
an
considerin
thet
take
a
dollar
a
day
more
on
my
wages
if
father
does
not
agree
to
that
i
will
said
kurt
now
how
about
the
other
men
wal
they
all
air
leanin
toward
promises
of
little
work
an
lots
of
pay
answered
jerry
with
a
laugh
morgan
on
the
fence
about

only
too
glad
to
make
trouble
fer

boss
they
goin
to
lay
off
the
rest
of
an
talk
with
glidden
they
all
agreed
to
meet
down
by
the
culvert
an
thet
what
they
was
arguin
with
me
fer
wanted
me
to
come
where
this
man
glidden
demanded
kurt
i
give
him
a
piece
of
my
mind
i
reckon
he
hangin
round
the
farm
out
of
sight
somewhere
all
right
jerry
now
you
go
back
to
work
you
never
lose
anything
by
sticking
to
us
i
promise
you
that
keep
your
eyes
and
ears
open
kurt
strode
back
to
the
house
and
his
entrance
to
the
kitchen
evidently
interrupted
a
colloquy
of
some
kind
the
hired
men
were
still
at
table
they
looked
down
at
their
plates
and
said
nothing
kurt
left
the
door
open
and
turning
he
asked
martha
if
his
father
had
been
to
dinner
no
an
what
more
when
i
called
he
takes
to
roarin
like
a
mad
bull
replied
the
woman
kurt
crossed
the
to
knock
upon
his
father
door
the
reply
forthcoming
did
justify
the
old
woman
comparison
it
certainly
caused
the
hired
men
to
evacuate
the
kitchen
with
alacrity
old
chris
roar
at
his
son
was
a
german
roar
which
did
not
soothe
the
young
rising
temper
of
late
the
father
had
taken
altogether
to
speaking
german
he
had
never
spoken
english
well
and
kurt
was
rapidly
approaching
the
point
where
he
would
not
speak
german
a
deadlock
was
in
sight
and
kurt
grimly
prepared
to
meet
it
he
pounded
on
the
locked
door
the
men
are
going
to
lay
off
he
called
who
runs
this
farm
was
the
thundered
reply
the
is
going
to
run
it
if
you
sulk
indoors
as
you
have
done
lately
yelled
kurt
he
thought
that
would
fetch
his
father
stamping
out
but
he
had
reckoned
falsely
there
was
no
further
sound
leaving
the
room
in
high
dudgeon
kurt
hurried
out
to
catch
the
hired
men
near
at
hand
and
to
order
them
back
to
work
they
trudged
off
surlily
toward
the
barn
then
kurt
went
on
to
search
for
the
men
and
after
looking
up
and
down
the
road
and
all
around
he
at
length
found
them
behind
an
old
strawstack
they
were
comfortably
sitting
down
backs
to
the
straw
eating
a
substantial
lunch
kurt
was
angry
and
did
not
care
his
appearance
however
did
not
faze
the
strangers
one
of
them
an
american
was
a
man
of
about
thirty
years
with
light
steely
secretive
gray
eyes
and
a
look
of
intelligence
and
assurance
that
did
not
harmonize
with
his
motley
garb
his
companion
was
a
foreigner
small
of
stature
with
eyes
like
a
ferret
and
deep
pits
in
his
sallow
face
do
you
know
you
trespassing
demanded
kurt
you
grudge
us
a
little
shade
eh
even
to
eat
a
bite
said
the
american
he
wrapped
a
paper
round
his
lunch
and
leisurely
rose
to
fasten
penetrating
eyes
upon
the
young
man
that
what
i
heard
about
you
rich
farmers
of
the
bend
what
business
have
you
coming
here
queried
kurt
with
sharp
heat
you
sneak
out
of
sight
of
the
farmers
you
trespass
to
get
at
our
men
and
with
a
lot
of
lies
and
guff
you
make
them
discontented
with
their
jobs
i
fire
these
men
just
for
listening
to
you
mister
dorn
we
want
you
to
fire
them
that
my
business
out
here
replied
the
american
who
are
you
anyway
that
my
business
too
kurt
passed
from
hot
to
cold
he
could
not
miss
the
antagonism
of
this
man
a
bold
and
menacing
attitude
my
foreman
says
your
name
glidden
went
on
kurt
cooler
this
time
and
that
you
talking
as
if
you
were
one
of
its
leaders
that
you
do
want
a
job
that
you
got
a
wad
of
money
that
you
coax
then
threaten
that
you
intimidated
three
of
our
hands
your
jerry
a
marked
man
said
glidden
shortly
you
impudent
scoundrel
exclaimed
kurt
now
you
listen
to
this
you
the
first
man
i
met
you
look
and
talk
like
an
american
but
if
you
are
american
you
a
traitor
we
a
war
to
fight
war
with
a
powerful
country
germany
and
you
come
spreading
discontent
in
the
when
wheat
means
life
get
out
of
here
before
i
we
mark
you
too
mister
dorn
and
your
snapped
glidden
with
one
swift
lunge
kurt
knocked
the
man
flat
and
then
leaped
to
stand
over
him
watching
for
a
move
to
draw
a
weapon
the
little
foreigner
slunk
back
out
of
reach
i
start
a
little
marking
myself
grimly
said
kurt
get
up
slowly
glidden
moved
from
elbow
to
knees
and
then
to
his
feet
his
cheek
was
puffing
out
and
his
nose
was
bleeding
the
eyes
were
lurid
that
for
your
declared
kurt
the
first
rule
of
your
is
to
abolish
capital
hey
kurt
had
not
intended
to
say
that
it
slipped
out
in
his
fury
but
the
effect
was
striking
glidden
gave
a
violent
start
and
his
face
turned
white
abruptly
he
hurried
away
his
companion
shuffled
after
him
kurt
stared
at
them
thinking
the
while
that
if
he
had
needed
any
proof
of
the
crookedness
of
the
he
had
seen
it
in
glidden
guilty
face
the
man
had
been
suddenly
frightened
and
surprise
too
had
been
prominent
in
his
countenance
then
kurt
remembered
how
anderson
had
intimated
that
the
secrets
of
the
had
been
long
hidden
kurt
keen
and
quick
in
his
sensibilities
divined
that
there
was
something
powerful
back
of
this
glidden
cunning
and
assurance
could
it
be
only
the
power
of
a
new
labor
organization
that
might
well
be
great
but
the
idea
did
not
convince
kurt
during
a
hurried
and
tremendous
preparation
by
the
government
for
war
any
disorder
such
as
menaced
the
country
would
be
little
short
of
a
calamity
it
might
turn
out
a
fatality
this
labor
union
intended
to
take
advantage
of
a
crisis
to
further
its
own
ends
yet
even
so
that
fact
did
not
wholly
explain
glidden
and
his
subtlety
some
nameless
force
loomed
dark
and
sinister
back
of
glidden
meaning
and
it
was
not
peril
to
the
wheatlands
of
the
northwest
alone
like
a
huge
dog
kurt
shook
himself
and
launched
into
action
there
were
sense
and
pleasure
in
muscular
activity
and
it
lessened
the
habit
of
worry
soon
he
ascertained
that
only
morgan
had
returned
to
work
in
the
fields
andrew
and
jansen
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
jansen
had
left
four
horses
hitched
to
a
harrow
kurt
went
out
to
take
up
the
work
thus
abandoned
it
was
a
long
field
and
if
he
had
earned
a
dollar
for
every
time
he
had
traversed
its
length
during
the
last
ten
years
he
would
have
been
a
rich
man
he
could
have
walked
it
blindfolded
it
was
fallow
ground
already
plowed
disked
rolled
and
now
the
last
stage
was
to
harrow
it
loosening
the
soil
conserving
the
moisture
morgan
far
to
the
other
side
of
this
section
had
the
better
of
the
job
for
his
harrow
was
a
new
machine
and
he
could
ride
while
driving
the
horses
but
kurt
using
an
old
harrow
had
to
walk
the
four
big
horses
plodded
at
a
gait
that
made
kurt
step
out
to
keep
up
with
them
to
keep
up
to
drive
a
straight
line
to
hold
back
on
the
reins
was
labor
for
a
man
it
spoke
well
for
kurt
that
he
had
followed
that
old
harrow
hundreds
of
miles
that
he
could
stand
the
strain
that
he
loved
both
the
physical
sense
and
the
spiritual
meaning
of
the
toil
driving
west
he
faced
a
wind
laden
with
dust
as
dry
as
powder
at
every
sheeted
cloud
whipping
back
from
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
and
the
steel
spikes
of
the
harrow
he
had
to
bat
his
eyes
to
keep
from
being
blinded
the
smell
of
dust
clogged
his
nostrils
as
soon
as
he
began
to
sweat
under
the
hot
sun
the
dust
caked
on
his
face
itching
stinging
burning
there
was
dust
between
his
teeth
driving
back
east
was
a
relief
the
wind
whipped
the
dust
away
from
him
and
he
could
catch
the
fragrance
of
the
newly
turned
soil
how
brown
and
clean
and
earthy
it
looked
where
the
harrow
had
cut
and
ridged
the
soil
did
not
look
thirsty
and
parched
but
that
which
was
unharrowed
cried
out
for
rain
no
cloud
in
the
hot
sky
except
the
yellow
clouds
of
dust
on
that
trip
east
across
the
field
which
faced
the
road
dorn
saw
pedestrians
in
twos
and
threes
passing
by
once
he
was
hailed
but
made
no
answer
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
to
see
a
crowd
yet
travelers
were
scarce
in
that
region
the
sight
of
these
men
some
of
them
carrying
bags
and
satchels
was
disturbing
to
the
young
farmer
where
were
they
going
all
appeared
outward
bound
toward
the
river
they
came
of
course
from
the
little
towns
the
railroads
the
cities
at
this
season
with
near
at
hand
it
had
been
in
former
years
no
unusual
sight
to
see
strings
of
laborers
passing
by
but
this
year
they
came
earlier
and
in
greater
numbers
with
the
wind
in
his
face
however
dorn
saw
nothing
but
the
horses
and
the
brown
line
ahead
and
half
the
time
they
were
wholly
obscured
in
yellow
dust
he
began
thinking
about
lenore
anderson
just
pondering
that
strange
steady
look
of
a
girl
eyes
and
then
he
did
not
mind
the
dust
or
heat
or
distance
never
could
he
be
cheated
of
his
thoughts
and
those
of
her
even
the
painful
ones
gave
birth
to
a
comfort
that
he
knew
must
abide
with
him
henceforth
on
lonely
labors
such
as
this
perhaps
in
the
lonelier
watches
of
a
soldier
duty
she
had
been
curious
aloof
then
sympathetic
she
had
studied
his
face
she
had
been
an
listener
to
his
discourse
on
wheat
but
she
had
not
guessed
his
secret
not
until
her
last
look
strange
deep
potent
had
he
guessed
that
secret
himself
so
with
mind
both
busy
and
absent
kurt
dorn
harrowed
the
fallow
ground
abandoned
by
his
men
and
when
the
day
was
done
with
the
sun
setting
hot
and
coppery
beyond
the
dim
dark
ranges
he
guided
the
tired
horses
homeward
and
plodded
back
of
them
weary
and
spent
he
was
to
learn
from
morgan
at
the
stables
that
the
old
man
had
discharged
both
andrew
and
jansen
and
jansen
liberating
some
newly
assimilated
poison
had
threatened
revenge
he
would
see
that
any
hired
men
would
learn
a
thing
or
two
so
that
they
would
not
sign
up
with
chris
dorn
in
a
fury
the
old
man
had
driven
jansen
out
into
the
road
sober
and
moody
kurt
put
the
horses
away
and
washing
the
dust
grime
from
sunburnt
face
and
hands
he
went
to
his
little
attic
room
where
he
changed
his
damp
and
sweaty
clothes
then
he
went
down
to
supper
with
mind
made
up
to
be
lenient
and
silent
with
his
old
and
sorely
tried
father
chris
dorn
sat
in
the
light
of
the
kitchen
lamps
he
was
a
huge
man
with
a
great
round
head
and
a
shock
of
gray
hair
and
bristling
grizzled
beard
his
face
was
broad
heavy
and
seemed
sodden
with
dark
brooding
thought
his
eyes
under
bushy
brows
were
pale
gleams
of
fire
he
looked
immovable
as
to
both
bulk
and
will
never
before
had
kurt
dorn
so
acutely
felt
the
fixed
contrary
ruthless
nature
of
his
parent
never
had
the
distance
between
them
seemed
so
great
kurt
shivered
and
sighed
at
once
then
being
hungry
he
fell
to
eating
in
silence
presently
the
old
man
shoved
his
plate
back
and
wiping
his
face
he
growled
in
german
i
discharged
andrew
and
jansen
yes
i
know
replied
kurt
it
was
good
judgment
what
we
do
for
hands
i
hire
more
men
are
coming
for
the
harvest
but
they
all
belong
to
the
protested
kurt
and
what
that
in
scarcely
subdued
wrath
kurt
described
in
detail
and
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
what
the
was
and
he
ended
by
declaring
the
organization
treacherous
to
the
united
states
how
that
asked
old
dorn
gruffly
kurt
was
actually
afraid
to
tell
his
father
who
never
read
newspapers
who
knew
little
of
what
was
going
on
that
if
the
allies
were
to
win
the
war
it
was
wheat
that
would
be
the
greatest
factor
instead
of
that
he
said
if
the
inaugurated
strikes
and
disorder
in
the
northwest
it
would
embarrass
the
government
then
i
hire
men
said
old
dorn
kurt
battled
against
a
rising
temper
this
blind
old
man
was
his
father
but
i
not
have
men
on
the
farm
retorted
kurt
i
just
punched
one
solicitor
i
run
this
farm
if
you
do
like
my
way
you
can
leave
darkly
asserted
the
father
kurt
fell
back
in
his
chair
and
stared
at
the
turgid
bulging
forehead
and
hard
eyes
before
him
what
could
be
behind
them
had
the
war
brought
out
a
twist
in
his
father
brain
why
were
germans
so
impossible
my
heavens
father
would
you
turn
me
out
of
my
home
because
we
disagree
he
asked
desperately
in
my
country
sons
obey
their
fathers
or
they
go
out
for
themselves
i
not
been
a
disobedient
son
declared
kurt
and
here
in
america
sons
have
more
freedom
more
say
america
has
no
sense
of
family
life
no
honest
government
i
hate
the
country
a
ball
of
fire
seemed
to
burst
in
kurt
that
kind
of
talk
infuriates
me
he
blazed
i
do
care
if
you
are
my
father
why
in
the
hell
did
you
come
to
america
why
did
you
stay
why
did
you
marry
my
mother
an
american
woman
that
rot
just
spiteful
rot
i
heard
you
tell
what
life
was
in
europe
when
you
were
a
boy
you
ran
off
you
stayed
in
this
country
because
it
was
a
better
country
than
yours
fifty
years
you
been
in
america
many
years
on
this
farm
and
you
love
this
land
my
god
father
ca
you
and
men
like
you
see
the
truth
aye
i
can
gloomily
replied
the
old
man
the
truth
is
we
lose
the
land
that
greedy
anderson
will
drive
me
off
he
will
not
he
fine
generous
asserted
kurt
earnestly
all
he
wanted
was
to
see
the
prospects
of
the
harvest
and
perhaps
to
help
you
anderson
has
not
had
interest
on
his
money
for
three
years
i
bet
he
paid
interest
demanded
by
the
other
stockholders
in
that
bank
you
borrowed
from
why
he
our
friend
aye
and
i
see
more
boomed
the
father
he
fetched
his
lass
up
here
to
make
eyes
at
my
son
i
saw
her
the
sly
wench
boy
you
not
marry
her
kurt
choked
back
his
mounting
rage
certainly
i
never
will
he
said
bitterly
but
i
would
if
she
have
me
what
thundered
dorn
his
white
locks
standing
up
and
shaking
like
the
mane
of
a
lion
that
wheat
banker
daughter
never
i
forbid
it
you
shall
not
marry
any
american
girl
father
this
is
idle
foolish
rant
cried
kurt
with
a
high
warning
note
in
his
voice
i
no
idea
of
marrying
but
if
i
had
one
whom
else
could
i
marry
except
an
american
girl
i
sell
the
wheat
the
land
we
go
back
to
germany
that
was
maddening
to
kurt
he
sprang
up
sending
dishes
to
the
floor
with
a
crash
he
bent
over
to
pound
the
table
with
a
fist
violent
speech
choked
him
and
he
felt
a
cold
tight
blanching
of
his
face
listen
he
rang
out
if
i
go
to
germany
it
be
as
a
soldier
to
kill
germans
i
done
i
through
with
the
very
name
listen
to
the
last
words
i
ever
speak
to
you
in
german
the
last
hell
with
then
kurt
plunged
blind
in
his
passion
out
of
the
door
into
the
night
and
as
he
went
he
heard
his
father
cry
out
brokenly
my
son
oh
my
son
the
night
was
dark
and
cool
a
faint
wind
blew
across
the
hills
and
it
was
dry
redolent
sweet
the
sky
seemed
an
endless
curving
canopy
of
dark
blue
blazing
with
myriads
of
stars
kurt
staggered
out
of
the
yard
down
along
the
edge
of
a
to
one
of
the
and
there
he
flung
himself
down
in
an
agony
oh
i
ruined
ruined
he
moaned
the
break
has
come
poor
old
dad
he
leaned
there
against
the
straw
shaking
and
throbbing
with
a
cold
perspiration
bathing
face
and
body
even
the
palms
of
his
hands
were
wet
a
terrible
fit
of
anger
was
beginning
to
loose
its
hold
upon
him
his
breathing
was
labored
in
gasps
and
sobs
unutterable
stupidity
of
his
father
horrible
cruelty
of
his
position
what
had
he
ever
done
in
all
his
life
to
suffer
under
such
a
curse
yet
almost
he
clung
to
his
wrath
for
it
had
been
righteous
that
thing
that
infernal
twist
in
the
brain
that
was
what
was
wrong
with
his
father
his
father
who
had
been
fifty
years
in
the
united
states
how
simple
then
to
understand
what
was
wrong
with
germany
by
god
i
am
american
he
panted
and
it
was
as
if
he
called
to
the
grave
of
his
mother
over
there
on
the
dark
windy
hill
that
tremendous
uprising
of
his
passion
had
been
a
vortex
an
end
a
decision
and
he
realized
that
even
to
that
hour
there
had
been
a
drag
in
his
blood
it
was
over
now
the
hell
was
done
with
his
soul
was
free
this
weak
quaking
body
of
his
housed
his
tainted
blood
and
the
emotions
of
his
heart
but
it
could
not
control
his
mind
his
will
beat
by
beat
the
helpless
fury
in
him
subsided
and
then
he
fell
back
and
lay
still
for
a
long
time
eyes
shut
relaxed
and
still
a
hound
bayed
mournfully
the
insects
chirped
low
incessantly
the
night
wind
rustled
the
silken
heads
of
wheat
after
a
while
the
young
man
sat
up
and
looked
at
the
heavens
at
the
twinkling
white
stars
and
then
away
across
the
shadows
of
round
hills
in
the
dusk
how
lonely
sad
intelligible
and
yet
mystic
the
night
and
the
scene
what
came
to
him
then
was
revealing
uplifting
a
source
of
strength
to
go
on
he
was
not
to
blame
for
what
had
happened
he
could
not
change
the
future
he
had
a
choice
between
playing
the
part
of
a
man
or
that
of
a
coward
and
he
had
to
choose
the
former
there
seemed
to
be
a
spirit
beside
him
the
spirit
of
his
mother
or
of
some
one
who
loved
him
and
who
would
have
him
be
true
to
an
ideal
and
if
needful
die
for
it
no
night
in
all
his
life
before
had
been
like
this
one
the
dreaming
hills
with
their
precious
rustling
wheat
meant
more
than
even
a
spirit
could
tell
where
had
the
wheat
come
from
that
had
seeded
these
fields
whence
the
first
and
original
seeds
and
where
were
the
sowers
back
in
the
ages
the
stars
the
night
the
dark
blue
of
heaven
hid
the
secret
in
their
impenetrableness
beyond
them
surely
was
the
answer
and
perhaps
peace
material
things
life
success
such
as
had
inspired
kurt
dorn
on
this
calm
night
lost
their
significance
and
were
seen
clearly
they
could
not
last
but
the
wheat
there
the
hills
the
stars
they
would
go
on
with
their
task
passion
was
the
dominant
side
of
a
man
declaring
itself
and
that
was
a
matter
of
inheritance
but
with
its
mercy
its
succor
its
seed
like
the
wheat
was
as
infinite
as
the
stars
he
had
long
made
up
his
mind
yet
that
had
not
given
him
absolute
restraint
the
world
was
full
of
little
men
but
he
refused
to
stay
little
this
war
that
had
come
between
him
and
his
father
had
been
bred
of
the
fumes
of
minds
turned
with
an
infantile
fatality
to
greedy
desires
his
poor
old
blinded
father
could
be
excused
and
forgiven
there
were
other
old
men
sick
crippled
idle
who
must
suffer
pain
but
whose
pain
could
be
lightened
there
were
babies
children
women
who
must
suffer
for
the
sins
of
men
but
that
suffering
need
no
longer
be
if
men
became
honest
and
true
his
sudden
love
had
a
few
hours
back
seemed
a
calamity
but
out
there
beside
the
whispering
wheat
under
the
passionless
stars
in
the
dreaming
night
it
had
turned
into
a
blessing
he
asked
nothing
but
to
serve
to
serve
her
his
country
his
future
all
at
once
he
who
had
always
yearned
for
something
unattainable
had
greatness
thrust
upon
him
his
tragical
situation
had
evoked
a
spirit
from
the
gods
to
kiss
that
girl
sweet
lips
would
be
a
sum
of
joy
earthly
precious
the
man
in
him
trembled
all
over
at
the
daring
thought
he
might
revel
in
such
dreams
and
surrender
to
them
since
she
would
never
know
but
the
divinity
he
sensed
there
in
the
presence
of
those
stars
did
not
dwell
on
a
woman
lips
kisses
were
for
the
present
the
all
too
fleeting
present
and
he
had
to
concern
himself
with
what
he
might
do
for
one
girl
future
it
was
exquisitely
sad
and
sweet
to
put
it
that
way
though
kurt
knew
that
if
he
had
never
seen
lenore
anderson
he
would
have
gone
to
war
just
the
same
he
was
not
making
an
abstract
sacrifice
the
rolling
before
him
every
clod
of
which
had
been
pressed
by
his
bare
feet
as
a
boy
the
father
whose
changeless
blood
had
sickened
at
the
son
of
his
loins
the
life
of
hope
freedom
of
action
of
achievement
of
wonderful
possibility
these
seemed
lost
to
kurt
dorn
a
necessary
renunciation
when
he
yielded
to
the
call
of
war
but
no
loss
no
sting
of
bullet
or
bayonet
no
torturing
victory
of
approaching
death
could
balance
in
the
scale
against
the
thought
of
a
picture
of
one
american
girl
as
she
stepped
somewhere
in
the
future
down
a
summer
lane
or
through
a
blossoming
orchard

on

it
was
a
dry
high
country
noted
for
an
equable
climate
with
cool
summers
and
mild
winters
and
this
unprecedented
wave
would
have
been
unbearable
had
not
the
atmosphere
been
free
from
humidity
the
haze
of
heat
seemed
like
a
pall
of
thin
smoke
from
distant
forest
fires
the
sun
rose
a
great
ball
hot
at

and
it
soared
at

that
they
had
five

to
leave
that

spokane
was
awakening
to
the
menace
of
hordes
of
strange
idle
men
who
came
in
on
the
westbound
the
railroads
had
been
unable
to
handle
the

were

sent

imperative
appeal
to
representative
ranchers
lumbermen
farmers
and
bade
them
come
to
spokane
to
discuss
the
situation
they
met
at
the
hotel

where
luncheon
was
served
in

of

appointed
of

splendid
hotel

was
riesinberg
a
man
of
german
forebears
but
all
american
in
his
sympathies
with
a
son
already
in
the
army
riesinberg
was
president
of
a
city
bank
and
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
his
first
words
to
the
large
assembly
of
westerners
were
gentlemen
we
are
here
to
discuss
the
most
threatening
and
unfortunate
situation
the
northwest
was
ever
called
upon
to
meet
his
address
was
not
long
but
it
was
stirring
the
chamber
of
commerce
could
provide
unlimited
means
could
influence
and
control
the
state
government
but
it
was
from
the
visitors
invited
to
this
meeting
the
men
of
the
outlying
districts
which
were
threatened
that
objective
proofs
must
come
and
the
best
methods
of
procedure
the
first
facts
to
come
out
were
that
many
crops
were
ruined
already
but
owing
to
the
increased
acreage
that
year
a
fair
yield
was
expected
that
wheat
in
the
bend
would
be
a
failure
though
some
farmers
here
and
there
would
harvest
well
that
the
lumber
districts
were
not
operating
on
account
of
the
then
it
was
that
the
organization
of
men
who
called
themselves
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
drew
the
absorbed
attention
of
the
meeting
depredations
already
committed
stunned
the
members
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
president
riesinberg
called
upon
beardsley
a
prominent
and
intelligent
rancher
of
the
southern
beardsley
said
it
is
difficult
to
speak
with
any
moderation
of
the
outrageous
eruption
of
the
it
is
nothing
less
than
rebellion
and
the
most
effective
means
of
suppressing
rebellion
is
to
apply
a
little
of
that
action
which
is
the
favorite
diversion
of
the
the
do
not
intend
to
accomplish
their
treacherous
aims
by
anything
so
feeble
as
speech
they
scorn
the
they
are
against
the
war
and
their
method
of
making
known
their
protest
is
by
burning
our
grain
destroying
our
lumber
and
blowing
up
they
seek
to
make
converts
not
by
argument
but
by
threats
and
intimidation
we
read
that
western
towns
are
seeking
to
deport
these
rebels
in
the
old
days
we
can
imagine
more
drastic
measures
would
have
been
taken
the
westerners
were
handy
with
the
rope
and
the
gun
in
those
days
we
are
not
counseling
lynch
law
but
we
think
deportation
is
too
mild
a
punishment
we
are
too
to
apply
the
old
roman
law
the
conquered
and
extirpate
the
rebels
but
at
least
we
could
intern
them
the
british
have
found
it
practicable
to
put
german
prisoners
to
work
at
useful
employment
why
could
we
do
the
same
with
our
rebel
jones
a
farmer
from
the
yakima
valley
told
that
business
men
housewives
professional
men
and
boys
and
girls
would
help
to
save
the
crop
of
washington
to
the
nation
in
case
of
labor
trouble
steps
already
had
been
taken
to
mobilize
workers
in
stores
offices
and
homes
for
work
in
the
orchards
and
should
the
situation
seriously
threaten
harvests
pledges
to
go
into
the
hay
or
grain
fields
or
the
orchards
with
a
statement
of
the
number
of
days
they
were
willing
to
work
had
been
signed
by
virtually
all
the
men
in
north
yakima
helmar
lumberman
from
the
blue
mountains
spoke
feelingly
he
said
my
company
is
the
owner
of
a
considerable
amount
of
timbered
lands
and
timber
purchased
from
the
state
and
from
individuals
we
have
been
engaged
in
logging
that
land
until
our
operations
have
been
stopped
and
our
business
paralyzed
by
an
organization
which
calls
itself
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
and
by
members
of
that
organization
and
other
lawless
persons
acting
in
sympathy
with
them
our
employees
have
been
threatened
with
physical
violence
and
death
our
works
are
picketed
by
individuals
who
camp
out
in
the
forests
and
who
intimidate
and
threaten
our
employees
open
threats
have
been
made
that
our
works
our
logs
and
our
timber
will
all
be
burned
sabotage
is
publicly
preached
in
the
meetings
and
in
the
literature
of
the
organization
it
is
advised
and
upheld
the
open
boast
is
made
that
the
lumbering
industry
with
all
other
industry
will
be
paralyzed
by
this
organization
by
the
destruction
of
property
used
in
industry
and
by
the
intimidation
of
laborers
who
are
willing
to
work
a
real
and
present
danger
to
the
property
of
my
company
exists
unless
protection
is
given
to
us
it
will
probably
be
burned
and
destroyed
our
lawful
operations
can
not
be
conducted
because
laborers
who
are
willing
to
work
are
fearful
of
their
lives
and
are
subject
to
abuse
threats
and
violence
our
camps
when
in
operation
are
visited
by
individuals
belonging
to
the
said
organization
and
the
men
peaceably
engaged
in
them
threatened
with
death
if
they
do
not
cease
work
all
sorts
of
injury
to
property
by
the
driving
of
spikes
in
logs
the
destruction
of
logs
and
other
similar
acts
are
encouraged
and
recommended
as
i
pointed
out
to
the
sheriff
of
our
county
the
season
is
a
very
dry
one
and
the
woods
are
and
will
be
unless
rain
comes
in
danger
of
disastrous
fires
the
organization
and
its
members
have
openly
and
repeatedly
asserted
that
they
will
burn
the
logs
in
the
woods
and
burn
the
forests
of
this
company
and
other
before
they
will
permit
logging
operations
to
continue
many
individuals
belonging
to
the
organization
are
camped
in
the
open
in
the
timbered
country
and
their
very
presence
is
a
fire
menace
they
are
engaged
in
no
business
except
to
interfere
with
the
industry
and
to
interfere
with
the
logging
of
this
company
and
others
who
engaged
in
the
logging
business
we
have
done
what
we
could
in
a
lawful
manner
to
continue
our
operations
and
to
protect
our
employees
we
are
now
helpless
and
place
the
responsibility
for
the
protection
of
our
property
and
the
protection
of
our
employees
upon
the
board
of
county
commissioners
and
upon
the
officers
of
the
county
next
president
riesinberg
called
upon
a
young
reporter
to
read
paragraphs
of
an
speech
he
had
heard
made
to
a
crowd
of
three
hundred
workmen
it
was
significant
that
several
members
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
called
for
a
certain
paragraph
to
be
reread
it
was
this
if
you
could
only
stand
together
you
could
do
in
this
country
what
has
been
done
in
russia
declared
the
orator
you
know
what
the
did
there
to
the
slimy
curs
the
gunmen
and
the
of
the
capitalistic
class
they
bumped
them
off
they
sent
them
up
to
say
morning
jesus
after
a
moment
of
muttering
and
another
silence
the
president
again
addressed
the
meeting
gentlemen
we
have
anderson
of
golden
valley
with
us
if
there
are
any
of
you
present
who
do
not
know
him
you
surely
have
heard
of
him
his
people
were
pioneers
he
was
born
in
washington
he
is
a
type
of
the
men
who
have
made
the
northwest
he
fought
the
indians
in
early
days
and
packed
a
gun
for
the
outlaws
and
gentlemen
he
owns
a
farm
as
big
as
spokane
county
we
want
to
hear
from
him
when
anderson
rose
to
reply
it
was
seen
that
he
was
pale
and
somber
slowly
he
gazed
at
the
assembly
of
waiting
men
bowed
then
he
began
impressively
gentlemen
an
friends
i
wish
i
did
have
to
throw
a
bomb
into
this
here
talk
but
i
got
to

a
strange
an
sudden
growth
of
this
here

several
years
but
this
year

tremendous
power

gold
anderson
deep
voice
rang
like
a
bell
his
hearers
sat
perfectly
silent
no
surprise
showed
but
faces
grew
set
and
hard
after
a
pause
of
suspense
in
which
his
denunciation
had
time
to
sink
in
anderson
resumed
a
few
weeks
ago
a
young
man
a
stranger
came
to
me
an
asked
for
a
job
he
could
do
anythin
he
said
an
i
hired
him
to
drive
my
car
but
he
was
much
of
a
driver
we
went
up
in
the
bend
country
one
day
an
on
that
trip
i
got
suspicious
of
him
i
caught
him
to
what
i
reckoned
was
men
an
then
back
home
again
i
watched
him
an
kept
my
ears
open
it
did
take
long
for
me
to
find
discontent
among
my
i
hire
about
a
hundred
hands
on
my
ranches
durin
the
long
off
season
an
when
harvest
comes
round
a
good
many
more
all
i
can
get
in
fact
well
i
found
my
hands
quittin
me
which
was
sure
onusual
an
i
laid
it
to
that
driver
one
day
not
long
ago
i
run
across
him
hobnobbin
with
the
strange
man
i
seen
talkin
with
him
on
the
bend
trip
but
my
driver
nash
he
calls
himself
did
see
me
that
night
i
put
a
cowboy
to
watch
him
an
what
this
cowboy
heard
put
together
two
an
two
was
that
nash
was
assistant
to
an
leader
named
glidden
he
had
sent
for
glidden
to
come
to
look
over
my
ranch
both
these
men
had
more
money
than
they
could
well
carry
lots
of
it
gold
the
way
they
talked
of
this
money
proved
that
they
did
not
know
the
source
but
the
supply
was
unlimited
next
day
glidden
could
not
be
found
but
my
cowboy
had
learned
enough
to
show
his
methods
if
these
proselyters
could
not
coax
or
scare
trusted
men
to
join
the
they
tried
to
corrupt
them
with
money
an
in
most
cases
they
successful
i
not
yet
sprung
anythin
on
my
driver
nash
but
he
ca
get
away
meanwhile
i
learn
much
by
watchin
him
maybe
through
nash
i
can
catch
glidden
an
so
gentlemen
here
we
have
a
plain
case
an
the
menace
is
enough
to
chill
the
heart
of
every
loyal
citizen
any
way
you
put
it
if
harvests
ca
be
harvested
if
lumber
forests
are
burned
if
the
state
militia
has
to
be
called
out
any
way
you
put
it
our
government
will
be
hampered
our
supplies
kept
from
our
allies
an
so
the
cause
of
germany
will
be
helped
the
have
back
of
them
an
organized
power
with
a
definite
purpose
there
can
hardly
be
any
doubt
that
that
power
is
germany
the
agitators
an
leaders
throughout
the
country
are
well
paid
probably
they
as
individuals
do
not
know
who
pays
them
undoubtedly
a
little
gang
of
men
makes
the
deals
handles
the
money
we
read
that
every
attorney
is
investigating
the
the
government
has
determined
to
close
down
on
them
but
lawyers
an
law
are
slow
to
act
meanwhile
the
danger
to
us
is
at
hand
gentlemen
to
finish
let
me
say
that
down
in
my
country
we
to
rustle
the
in
the
good
old
western
way
chapter
v
golden
valley
was
the
garden
of
eden
of
the
northwest
the
southern
slope
rose
to
the
blue
mountains
whence
flowed
down
the
innumerable
brooks
that
uniting
to
form
streams
and
rivers
abundantly
watered
the
valley
the
black
reaches
of
timber
extended
down
to
the
and
these
bordered
on
the
sloping
golden
which
in
turn
contrasted
so
vividly
with
the
lower
green
then
came
the
orchards
with
their
ruddy
mellow
fruit
and
lastly
the
where
the
attested
to
the
wonderful
richness
of
the
soil
from
the
the
valley
seemed
a
series
of
colored
benches
stepping
down
black
to
gray
and
gray
to
gold
and
gold
to
green
with
purple
tinge
and
on
to
the
perfectly
ordered
floor
with
its
innumerable
winding
streams
glinting
in
the
sunlight
the
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
never
visited
golden
valley
spokane
and
the
bend
country
just
now
sweltering
in
a
torrid
zone
might
as
well
have
been
in
the
sahara
for
all
the
effect
it
had
on
this
garden
spot
of
all
the
inland
empire
it
was
hot
in
the
valley
but
not
unpleasant
in
fact
the
greatest
charm
in
this
secluded
vale
was
its
pleasant
climate
all
the
year
round
no
summer
cyclones
no
winter
blizzards
no
cloudbursts
or
bad
thunderstorms
it
was
a
country
that
once
lived
in
could
never
be
left
there
were
no
poor
inhabitants
in
that
great
area
of
hundred
miles
and
there
were
many
who
were
rich
prosperous
little
towns
dotted
the
valley
floor
and
the
many
smooth
dusty
roads
all
led
to
ruxton
a
wealthy
and
fine
city
anderson
the
rancher
had
driven
his
car
to
spokane
upon
his
return
he
had
with
him
a
detective
whom
he
expected
to
use
in
the
investigations
and
a
neighbor
rancher
they
had
left
spokane
early
and
had
endured
almost
insupportable
dust
and
heat
a
welcome
change
began
as
they
slid
down
from
the
bare
desert
into
the
valley
and
once
across
the
copper
river
anderson
began
to
breathe
freer
and
to
feel
he
was
nearing
home
god
country
he
said
as
he
struck
the
first
low
swell
of
rising
land
where
a
cool
wind
from
off
the
wooded
and
watered
hills
greeted
his
face
dust
there
still
was
but
it
seemed
a
different
kind
and
smelled
of
and
here
were
hard
smooth
roads
and
anderson
sped
his
car
miles
and
miles
through
a
country
that
was
a
verdant
fragrant
bower
and
across
bright
shady
streams
and
by
white
little
hamlets
at
huntington
he
dropped
his
neighbor
rancher
and
also
the
detective
hall
who
was
to
go
disguised
into
the
districts
overrun
by
the
a
further
run
of
forty
miles
put
him
on
his
own
property
anderson
owned
a
string
of
farms
and
ranches
extending
from
the
to
the
of
the
mountains
they
represented
his
life
of
hard
work
and
fair
dealing
many
of
these
orchard
and
vegetable
lands
he
had
tenant
farmers
work
on
shares
the
uplands
or
wheat
and
grass
he
operated
himself
as
he
had
accumulated
property
he
had
changed
his
place
of
residence
from
time
to
time
at
last
to
build
a
beautiful
and
permanent
home
farther
up
on
the
valley
slope
than
any
of
the
others
it
was
a
modern
house
white
with
a
red
roof
situated
upon
a
high
level
bench
with
the
waving
gold
fields
sloping
up
from
it
and
the
green
squares
of
alfalfa
and
orchards
below
it
appeared
a
landmark
from
all
around
and
could
be
plainly
seen
from
vale
the
nearest
little
town
five
miles
away
anderson
had
always
loved
the
open
and
he
wanted
a
place
where
he
could
see
the
sun
rise
over
the
distant
valley
gateway
and
watch
it
set
beyond
the
bold
black
range
in
the
west
he
could
sit
on
his
front
porch
wide
and
shady
and
look
down
over
two
thousand
acres
of
his
own
land
but
from
the
back
porch
no
eye
could
have
encompassed
the
limit
of
his
broad
swelling
slopes
of
grain
and
grass
from
the
main
road
he
drove
up
to
the
right
of
the
house
where
under
a
dip
of
wooded
slope
clustered
barns
sheds
corrals
granaries
engine
and
machinery
houses
a
store
and
the
homes
of
hired
men
a
little
village
in
itself
the
sounds
he
heard
were
a
welcome
home
the
rush
of
swift
water
not
twenty
yards
from
where
he
stopped
the
car
in
the
big
courtyard
the
pound
of
hoofs
on
the
barn
floor
the
shrill
whistle
of
a
stallion
that
saw
and
recognized
him
the
drawling
laugh
of
his
cowboys
and
the
clink
of
their
spurs
as
they
became
aware
of
his
return
nash
the
suspected
driver
was
among
those
who
hurried
to
meet
the
car
anderson
keen
covert
glance
made
note
of
the
driver
worried
and
anxious
face
nash
she
need
a
lookin
over
he
said
as
he
uncovered
bundles
in
the
back
seat
and
lifted
them
out
all
right
sir
replied
nash
eagerly
a
note
of
ended
strain
was
significant
in
his
voice
here
you
jake
cheerily
called
anderson
to
a
fellow
who
wore
the
garb
of
a
cowboy
boss
i
powerful
glad
to
see
you
home
replied
jake
as
he
received
bundle
after
bundle
until
he
was
loaded
down
then
he
grinned
mebbe
you
want
a
you
hoss
enough
for
me
come
on
he
said
and
waving
the
other
men
aside
he
turned
toward
the
green
shady
hill
above
which
the
red
and
white
of
the
house
just
showed
a
bridge
crossed
the
rushing
stream
here
jake
dropped
some
of
the
bundles
and
anderson
recovered
them
as
he
straightened
up
he
looked
searchingly
at
the
cowboy
jake
eyes
returned
the
gaze
and
that
exchange
showed
these
two
of
the
same
breed
and
sure
of
each
other
nawthin
come
off
boss
he
drawled
but
i
glad
you

nash

the
place
queried
anderson
twice
at
night
an
he
was
gone
long

did
foller

seen
he
did
take
no
luggage

how
many

anderson
darkly

a
single
steer

anderson
walked
the
rest
of
the
way
up
the
shady
path
to
the
house
without
saying
any
more
to
jake
the
beautiful
white
house
stood
clear
of
the
grove
bright
in
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
a
barking
of
dogs
greeted
anderson
and
then
the
pattering
of
feet
his
daughters
appeared
on
the
porch
kathleen
who
was
ten
made
a
dive
for
him
and
rose
who
was
fourteen
came
flying
after
her
both
girls
were
screaming
joyously
their
sunny
hair
danced
lenore
waited
for
him
at
the
step
and
as
he
mounted
the
porch
burdened
by
the
three
girls
his
anxious
sadly
smiling
wife
came
out
to
make
perfect
the
welcome
home
no
not
perfect
for
anderson
joy
held
a
bitter
drop
the
absence
of
his
only
son
oh
dad
did
you
fetch
me
cried
kathleen
and
she
deserted
her
father
for
the
jake
and
me
echoed
rose
even
lenore
in
the
happiness
of
her
father
return
was
not
proof
against
the
wonder
and
promise
of
those
many
bundles
they
all
went
within
through
a
hall
to
a
great
cozy
anderson
very
first
words
after
her
welcoming
smile
were
a
any
news
of
jim
why
yes
replied
anderson
hesitatingly
suddenly
the
three
sisters
were
silent
how
closely
they
resembled
one
another
then
lenore
a
budding
woman
rose
a
budding
girl
and
kathleen
a
rosy
radiant
child
lenore
lost
a
little
of
her
bloom
what
news
father
she
asked
have
you
heard
from
him
returned
anderson
not
for
a
whole
week
he
wrote
the
day
he
reached
spokane
but
then
he
hardly
knew
anything
except
that
he
enlisted
i
sure
glad
jim
did
wait
for
the
draft
replied
the
father
well
mother
an
girls
jim
was
gone
when
i
got
to
spokane
all
i
heard
was
that
he
was
well
when
he
left
for
frisco
an
strong
for
the
aviation
corps
then
he
means
to
to
be
an
aviator
said
lenore
with
quivering
lips
sure
if
he
can
get
in
an
he
wise
jim
knows
engines
he
has
a
knack
for
machinery
an
nerve
no
boy
ever
had
more
he
make
a
crack
flier
but
the
danger
whispered
the
boy
mother
with
a
shudder
i
reckon
there
be
a
little
danger
mother
replied
anderson
cheerfully
we
got
to
take
our
chance
on
jim
there
one
sure
bet
if
he
had
stayed
home
he
been
fightin
that
trying
moment
passed
anderson
said
that
she
would
see
to
supper
being
put
on
the
table
at
once
the
younger
girls
began
untying
the
bundles
lenore
studied
her
father
face
a
moment
jake

she
said
to
the
waiting
cowboy
wait
till
after

before

drawled
jake
an
if
he
wants

hev
to
look

up

only
tired

worried
replied
anderson
as
jake
shuffled
out
with
jingling
spurs
did
anything
serious
happen
in
spokane
she
asked
anxiously
no
but
spokane
men
are
alive
to
serious
trouble
ahead
replied
her
father
i
spoke
to
the
chamber
of
commerce
sure
exploded
a
bomb
in
that
camp
then
i
had
conferences
with
a
good
many
different
men
fact
is
they
ran
me
pretty
hard
could
have
slept
much
anyhow
in
that
heat
lass
this
is
the
place
to
live
i
rather
die
here
than
live
in
spokane
in
summer
did
you
see
the
governor
yes
an
he
was
as
anxious
about
the
golden
valley
as
the
bend
country
he
right
too
we
old
westerners
here
we
can
handle
trouble
but
they
not
americans
up
there
in
the
bend
father
we
met
one
american
said
lenore
dreamily
by
george
we
did
an
that
reminds
me
there
was
a
government
official
from
washington
come
out
to
spokane
to
investigate
conditions
i
forget
his
name
he
asked
to
meet
me
an
he
was
curious
about
the
bend
its
loyalty
to
the
i
told
him
all
i
knew
an
what
i
thought
an
then
he
said
he
was
goin
to
motor
through
that
an
talk
to
what
americans
he
could
find
an
impress
upon
them
that
they
could
do
as
much
as
soldiers
to
win
the
war
wheat
bread
that
our
great
gun
in
this
war
lenore
i
knew
this
but
i
was
made
pretty
blamed
sober
by
that
government
man
i
told
him
by
all
means
to
go
to
palmer
an
to
have
a
talk
with
young
dorn
i
sure
gave
that
boy
a
good
word
poor
lad
he
true
blue
an
to
think
of
him
with
that
old
german
devil
old
dorn
has
always
had
a
hard
name
an
this
war
has
brought
out
the
german
cussedness
father
i
glad
you
spoke
well
of
the
young
man
said
lenore
still
dreamily
hum
you
never
told
me
what
you
thought
replied
her
father
with
a
quick
glance
of
inquiry
at
her
lenore
was
gazing
out
of
the
window
away
across
the
and
the
range
anderson
watched
her
a
moment
and
then
resumed
if
i
can
get
away
i
goin
to
drive
up
to
see
dorn
again
pretty
soon
do
you
want
to
go
lenore
gave
a
little
start
as
if
the
question
had
surprised
her
i
i
hardly
think
so
she
replied
it
just
as
well
he
said
that
be
a
hard
ride
guess
clean
up
a
little
for
supper
anderson
left
the
room
and
while
kathleen
and
rose
gleefully
squabbled
over
the
bundles
lenore
continued
to
gaze
dreamily
out
of
the
window
that
night
lenore
went
early
to
her
room
despite
the
presence
of
some
young
people
from
a
neighboring
village
she
locked
her
door
and
sat
in
the
dark
beside
her
open
window
an
early
moon
silvered
the
long
slopes
of
wheat
and
made
the
alfalfa
squares
seem
black
a
cool
faint
sweet
breeze
fanned
her
cheek
she
could
smell
the
fragrance
of
apples
of
hay
and
she
could
hear
the
low
murmur
of
running
water
a
hound
bayed
off
somewhere
in
the
fields
there
was
no
other
sound
it
was
a
quiet
beautiful
pastoral
scene
but
somehow
it
did
not
comfort
lenore
she
seemed
to
doubt
the
sincerity
of
what
she
saw
there
and
loved
so
well
and
serene
lonely
and
silent
beautiful
and
promising
the
wide
acres
of
many
waters
and
the
silver
slopes
and
dark
mountains
beyond
did
not
tell
the
truth
over
the
dark
ranges
a
hideous
war
had
stretched
out
a
red
hand
to
her
country
her
only
brother
had
left
his
home
to
fight
and
there
was
no
telling
if
he
would
ever
come
back
evil
forces
were
at
work
out
there
in
the
moonlight
there
had
come
a
time
for
her
to
be
thoughtful
her
father
asking
her
to
ride
to
the
bend
country
had
caused
some
strange
little
shock
of
surprise
lenore
had
dreamed
without
thinking
here
in
the
darkness
and
silence
watching
the
crescent
moon
slowly
sink
she
did
think
and
it
was
to
learn
that
she
remembered
singularly
well
the
first
time
she
had
seen
young
dorn
and
still
more
vividly
the
second
time
but
the
third
time
seemed
both
clear
and
vague
enough
young
men
had
been
smitten
with
lenore
to
enable
her
to
gauge
the
symptoms
of
these
attractions
in
fact
they
rather
repelled
her
but
she
had
found
dorn
manner
striking
confusing
and
unforgettable
and
why
that
should
be
so
interested
her
intelligence
it
was
confusing
to
discover
that
she
could
not
lay
it
to
the
sympathy
she
had
felt
for
an
american
boy
in
a
difficult
position
because
she
had
often
thought
of
him
long
before
she
had
any
idea
who
he
was
or
where
he
lived
in
the
very
first
place
he
had
been
unforgettable
for
two
reasons
because
he
had
been
so
struck
at
sight
of
her
that
he
had
gazed
unconsciously
with
a
glow
on
his
face
and
a
radiance
in
his
eye
as
of
a
young
poet
spellbound
at
an
inspiration
and
because
he
seemed
the
physical
type
of
young
man
she
had
idealized
a
strong
blond
giant
with
a
handsome
frank
face
and
smooth
and
only
after
meeting
him
out
there
in
the
desert
of
wheat
had
she
felt
sympathy
for
him
and
now
with
intelligence
and
a
woman
intuition
barring
the
old
insidious
dreamy
mood
lenore
went
over
in
retrospect
all
she
could
remember
of
that
meeting
and
the
truth
made
her
sharply
catch
her
breath
dorn
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
intuition
declared
that
while
her
intelligence
repudiated
it
stranger
than
all
was
the
thrill
which
began
somewhere
in
the
unknown
depths
of
her
and
mounted
to
leave
her
tingling
all
over
she
had
told
her
father
that
she
did
not
want
to
ride
to
the
bend
country
but
she
did
want
to
go
and
that
thought
flashing
up
would
not
be
denied
to
want
to
meet
a
strange
young
man
again
was
absolutely
a
new
and
irritating
discovery
for
lenore
it
mystified
her
because
she
had
not
had
time
to
like
dorn
liking
an
acquaintance
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
and
that
stunned
her
could
it
be
love
at
first
sight
she
whispered
incredulously
as
she
stared
out
over
the
shadowing
fields
for
me
why
how
absurd
impossible
i
i
only
remembered
him
a
big
handsome
boy
with
blazing
eyes
and
now
i
sorry
for
him
to
whisper
her
amaze
and
doubt
and
consternation
only
augmented
the
instinctive
recurring
emotion
she
felt
something
she
could
not
explain
and
that
something
was
scarcely
owing
to
this
young
man
pitiful
position
between
duty
to
his
father
and
love
for
his
country
it
had
to
do
with
his
blazing
eyes
intangible
dreamlike
perceptions
of
him
as
not
real
of
vague
sweet
fancies
that
retreated
before
her
introspective
questioning
what
alarmed
lenore
was
a
tendency
of
her
mind
to
shirk
this
revealing
analysis
never
before
had
she
been
afraid
to
look
into
herself
but
now
she
was
finding
unplumbed
wells
of
feeling
secret
chambers
of
dreams
into
which
she
had
never
let
the
light
strange
instinctive
activities
more
physical
than
mental
when
in
her
life
before
had
she
experienced
a
nameless
palpitation
of
her
heart
long
she
sat
there
staring
out
into
the
night
and
the
change
in
the
aspect
of
the
broad
spaces
now
dark
and
impenetrable
and
mysterious
seemed
like
the
change
in
the
knowledge
of
herself
once
she
had
flattered
herself
that
she
was
an
inch
of
crystal
water
now
she
seemed
a
complex
aloof
and
contrary
creature
almost
on
the
verge
of
tumultuous
emotions
she
said
her
prayers
that
night
a
girlish
habit
resumed
since
her
brother
had
declared
his
intention
of
enlisting
in
the
army
and
to
that
old
prayer
which
her
mother
had
prayed
before
her
she
added
an
appeal
of
her
own
strange
that
young
dorn
face
should
flash
out
of
gloom
it
was
there
and
her
brother
was
fading
i
wonder
will
he
and
jim
meet
over
there
on
the
she
whispered
she
hoped
they
would
like
tigers
those
boys
would
fight
the
germans
her
heart
beat
high
then
a
cold
wind
seemed
to
blow
over
her
it
had
a
sickening
weight
if
that
icy
and
somber
wind
could
have
been
traced
to
its
source
then
the
mystery
of
life
would
have
been
clear
but
that
source
was
the
cause
of
war
as
its
effect
was
the
horror
of
women
a
hideous
and
monstrous
thing
existed
out
there
in
the
darkness
lenore
passionately
loved
her
brother
and
this
black
thing
had
taken
him
away
why
could
not
women
who
suffered
most
have
some
word
in
the
regulation
of
events
if
women
could
help
govern
the
world
there
would
be
no
wars
at
last
encroaching
drowsiness
dulled
the
poignancy
of
her
feelings
and
she
sank
to
sleep
chapter
vi
singing
of
birds
at
her
window
awakened
lenore
the
dawn
streamed
in
bright
and
sweetly
fragrant
the
seemed
a
rosy
gold
and
all
that
open
slope
called
to
her
thrillingly
of
the
beauty
of
the
world
and
the
happiness
of
youth
it
was
not
possible
to
be
morbid
at
dawn
i
hear
i
hear
she
whispered
from
a
thousand
slopes
far
and
wide
at
the
when
there
came
opportunity
she
looked
up
serenely
and
said
father
on
second
thought
i
will
go
the
bend
thank
you
anderson
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
his
eyes
opened
wide
in
surprise
changed
your
mind
he
exclaimed
that
a
privilege
i
have
you
know
she
replied
calmly
anderson
appeared
more
anxious
than
surprised
daughter
do
go
that
will
be
a
fearful
ride
hum
sure
glad
to
have
you
lass
added
anderson
with
his
keen
eyes
on
her
let
me
go
too
begged
rose
kathleen
was
solemnly
gazing
at
lenore
with
the
wise
penetrating
eyes
of
extreme
youth
lenore
i
bet
you
got
a
new
beau
up
there
she
declared
lenore
flushed
scarlet
she
was
less
angry
with
her
little
sister
than
with
the
incomprehensible
fact
of
a
playful
word
bringing
the
blood
stingingly
to
her
neck
and
face
kitty
you
forget
your
manners
she
said
sharply
kit
is
fresh
she
an
awful
child
added
rose
with
a
superior
air
i
did
say
a
thing
cried
kathleen
hotly
lenore
if
it
true
why
you
blush
so
red
hush
you
silly
children
ordered
the
mother
reprovingly
lenore
was
glad
to
finish
that
meal
and
to
get
outdoors
she
could
smile
now
at
that
shrewd
and
terrible
kitty
but
recollection
of
her
keen
eyes
was
confusing
lenore
felt
there
was
really
nothing
to
blush
for
still
she
could
scarcely
tell
her
father
that
upon
awakening
this
morning
she
had
found
her
mind
made
up
that
only
by
going
to
the
bend
country
could
she
determine
the
true
state
of
her
feelings
she
simply
dared
not
accuse
herself
of
being
in
unusually
radiant
spirits
because
she
was
going
to
undertake
a
long
hard
ride
into
a
barren
desert
country
the
grave
and
thoughtful
mood
of
last
night
had
gone
with
her
slumbers
often
lenore
had
found
problems
decided
for
her
while
she
slept
on
this
fresh
sweet
summer
morning
with
the
sun
bright
and
warm
presaging
a
hot
and
glorious
day
lenore
wanted
to
run
with
the
winds
to
wade
through
the
alfalfa
to
watch
with
strange
and
renewed
pleasure
the
waves
of
shadow
as
they
went
over
the
wheat
all
her
life
she
had
known
and
loved
the
fields
of
waving
gold
but
they
had
never
been
to
her
what
they
had
become
overnight
perhaps
this
was
because
it
had
been
said
that
the
issue
of
the
great
war
the
salvation
of
the
world
and
its
happiness
its
hope
depended
upon
the
millions
of
broad
acres
of
golden
grain
bread
was
the
staff
of
life
lenore
felt
that
she
was
changing
and
growing
if
anything
should
happen
to
her
brother
jim
she
would
be
heiress
to
thousands
of
acres
of
wheat
a
pang
shot
through
her
heart
she
had
to
drive
the
cold
thought
away
and
she
must
learn
must
know
the
bigness
of
this
question
the
women
of
the
country
would
be
called
upon
to
help
to
do
their
share
she
ran
down
through
the
grove
and
across
the
bridge
coming
abruptly
upon
nash
her
father
driver
he
had
the
car
out
good
morning
he
said
with
a
smile
doffing
his
cap
lenore
returned
his
greeting
and
asked
if
her
father
intended
to
go
anywhere
no
i
taking
telegrams
to
huntington
telegrams
what
the
matter
with
the
she
queried
wire
was
cut
yesterday
by
men
so
your
father
says
i
do
know
something
ought
to
be
done
to
those
men
said
lenore
severely
nash
was
a
young
man
with
light
eyes
and
hair
he
appeared
to
be
intelligent
and
had
some
breeding
but
his
manner
when
alone
with
lenore
he
had
driven
her
to
town
several
times
was
not
the
same
as
when
her
father
was
present
lenore
had
not
bothered
her
mind
about
it
but
the
look
in
his
eyes
was
offensive
to
her
between
you
and
me
lenore
i
sympathy
for
those
poor
devils
he
said
lenore
drew
back
rather
haughtily
at
this
familiar
use
of
her
first
name
it
does
concern
me
she
said
coldly
and
turned
away
wo
you
ride
along
with
me
i
driving
around
for
the
mail
he
called
after
her
no
returned
lenore
shortly
and
hurried
on
out
of
earshot
the
impertinence
of
the
fellow
mawnin
miss
lenore
drawled
a
cheery
voice
the
voice
and
the
jingle
of
spurs
behind
her
told
lenore
of
the
presence
of
the
best
liked
of
all
her
father
men
good

and
looked
at
the
cowboy

have
trusted

he
looked
earnest

passed
all
had
an
eager
good
morning
for
her
she
often
boasted
to
her
father
that
she
could
run
many
waters
as
well
as
he
sometimes
there
were
difficulties
that
lenore
had
no
little
part
in
smoothing
over
the
barns
and
corrals
were
familiar
places
to
her
and
she
insisted
upon
petting
every
horse
in
some
instances
to
jake
manifest
concern
some
of
them
bosses
are
bad
he
insisted
to
be
sure
they
are
when
wicked
cowboys
cuff
and
kick
them
replied
lenore
laughingly
wal
if
i
wicked
i
to

said
jake
reflectively
them
germans
bother
me
but
jake

much
obliged

the
fact

much

young
feller
i
bet

but
i
hope

we
absolutely

not
run
this
ranch
without
you
sure
i
knew
thet
wal
then
i
reckon
i
hang
around
till
married
miss
lenore
he
drawled
again
the
scarlet
mantled
lenore
cheeks
good
we
have
many
harvests
then
jake
and
many
rides
she
replied
aw
i
do
know
he
began
but
lenore
ran
away
so
that
she
could
hear
no
more
what
the
matter
with
me
that
people
that
jake
should
she
began
and
ended
with
a
hand
on
each
soft
hot
cheek
there
was
something
different
about
her
that
seemed
certain
and
if
her
eyes
were
as
bright
as
the
day
with
its
deep
blue
and
white
clouds
and
shining
green
and
golden
fields
then
any
one
might
think
what
he
liked
and
have
proof
for
his
tormenting
but
married
i
not
much
do
i
want
a
husband
getting
shot
the
path
lenore
trod
so
lightly
led
along
a
great
peach
and
apple
orchard
where
the
trees
were
set
far
apart
and
the
soil
was
cultivated
so
that
not
a
weed
nor
a
blade
of
grass
showed
the
fragrance
of
fruit
in
the
air
however
did
not
come
from
this
orchard
for
the
trees
were
young
and
the
reddening
fruit
rare
down
the
wide
aisles
she
saw
the
thick
and
abundant
green
of
the
older
orchards
at
length
lenore
reached
the
and
here
among
the
mounds
of
newly
cut
hay
that
smelled
so
fresh
and
sweet
she
wanted
to
roll
and
she
had
to
run
two
great
wagons
with
four
horses
each
were
being
loaded
lenore
knew
all
the
workmen
except
one
silas
warner
an
old
farmer
had
been
with
her
father
as
long
as
she
could
remember
whar
you
goin
lass
he
called
as
he
halted
to
wipe
his
red
face
with
a
huge
bandana
it
too
hot
to
run
the
way
you
oh
silas
it
a
grand
morning
she
replied
why
so
is
pitchin
hay
hyar
made
me
think
it
was
hot
he
said
as
she
tripped
on
now
lass
do
go
up
to
the
but
lenore
heard
heedlessly
and
she
ran
on
till
she
came
to
the
uncut
alfalfa
which
impeded
her
progress
a
wonderful
space
of
green
and
purple
stretched
away
before
her
and
into
it
she
waded
it
came
up
to
her
knees
rich
thick
soft
and
redolent
of
blossom
and
ripeness
hard
tramping
it
soon
got
to
be
she
grew
hot
and
breathless
and
her
legs
ached
from
the
force
expended
in
making
progress
through
the
tangled
hay
at
last
she
was
almost
across
the
field
far
from
the
cutters
and
here
she
flung
herself
to
roll
and
lie
flat
and
gaze
up
through
the
deep
azure
of
sky
wonderingly
as
if
to
penetrate
its
secret
and
then
she
hid
her
face
in
the
fragrant
thickness
that
seemed
to
force
a
whisper
from
her
i
wonder
how
will
i
feel
when
i
see
him
again
oh
i
wonder
the
sound
of
the
whispered
words
the
question
the
inevitableness
of
something
involuntary
proved
traitors
to
her
happy
dreams
her
assurance
her
composure
she
tried
to
burrow
under
the
hay
to
hide
from
that
tremendous
eye
the
sky
suddenly
she
lay
very
quiet
feeling
the
strange
glow
and
throb
and
race
of
her
blood
sensing
the
mystery
of
her
body
trying
to
trace
the
thrills
to
control
this
queer
tremulous
internal
state
but
she
found
she
could
not
think
clearly
she
could
only
feel
and
she
gave
up
trying
it
was
sweet
to
feel
she
rose
and
went
on
another
field
lay
beyond
a
gradual
slope
covered
with
a
new
growth
of
alfalfa
it
was
a
light
green
a
contrast
to
the
rich
darkness
of
that
behind
her
at
the
end
of
this
field
ran
a
swift
little
brook
clear
and
musical
open
to
the
sky
in
places
and
in
others
hidden
under
flowery
banks
birds
sang
from
invisible
coverts
a
quail
sent
up
clear
flutelike
notes
and
a
lark
caroled
seemingly
out
of
the
sky
lenore
wet
her
feet
crossing
the
brook
and
climbing
the
little
knoll
above
she
sat
down
upon
a
stone
to
dry
them
in
the
sun
it
had
a
burn
that
felt
good
no
matter
how
hot
the
sun
ever
got
there
she
liked
it
always
there
seemed
air
to
breathe
and
the
shade
was
pleasant
from
this
a
favorite
one
with
lenore
she
could
see
all
the
the
hill
crowned
by
the
beautiful
house
the
acres
of
garden
and
the
miles
of
orchards
the
grazing
and
grain
fields
began
behind
her
the
brook
murmured
below
her
and
the
birds
sang
she
heard
the
bees
humming
by
the
air
out
here
was
clear
of
scent
of
fruit
and
hay
and
it
bore
a
drier
odor
not
so
sweet
she
could
see
the
workmen
first
those
among
the
alfalfa
and
then
the
men
and
women
too
bending
over
on
the
likewise
she
could
see
the
gleam
of
peaches
apples
pears
and
plums
a
colorful
and
mixed
gleam
delightful
to
the
eye
wet
or
dry
it
seemed
that
her
feet
refused
to
stay
still
and
once
again
she
was
wandering
a
gray
field
of
oats
invited
her
steps
and
across
this
stretch
she
saw
a
long
yellow
slope
of
barley
where
the
men
were
cutting
beyond
waved
the
golden
fields
of
wheat
lenore
imagined
that
when
she
reached
them
she
would
not
desire
to
wander
farther
there
were
two
machines
cutting
on
the
barley
slope
one
drawn
by
eight
horses
and
the
other
by
twelve
when
lenore
had
crossed
the
she
discovered
a
number
of
strange
men
lounging
in
the
scant
shade
of
a
line
of
low
trees
that
separated
the
fields
here
she
saw
adams
the
foreman
and
he
espied
her
at
the
same
moment
he
had
been
sitting
down
talking
to
the
men
at
once
he
rose
to
come
toward
lenore
is
your
father
with
you
he
asked
no
he
too
slow
for
me
replied
lenore
who
are
these
men
they
strangers
looking
for
jobs
men
queried
lenore
in
lower
voice
surely
must
be
he
replied
adams
was
not
a
young
not
a
robust
man
and
he
seemed
to
carry
a
burden
of
worry
your
father
said
he
would
come
right
out
i
hope
he
does
said
lenore
bluntly
father
has
a
way
with
him
you
know
yes
i
know
and
it
the
way
we
needing
here
in
the
valley
replied
the
foreman
significantly
is
that
the
new
father
just
bought
asked
lenore
pointing
to
the
huge
machine
shining
and
creeping
behind
the
twelve
horses
yes
that
the
mccormack
and
it
a
dandy
returned
adams
with
machines
like
that
we
can
get
along
without
the
i
want
a
ride
on
it
declared
lenore
and
she
ran
along
to
meet
the
harvester
she
waved
her
hand
to
the
driver
bill
jones
another
old
hand
long
employed
by
her
father
bill
hauled
back
on
the
reins
and
when
the
horses
stopped
the
clattering
whirring
roar
of
the
machine
also
ceased
howdy
miss
reckon
this
a
regular
worse
than
that
bill
gaily
replied
lenore
as
she
mounted
the
platform
where
another
man
sat
on
a
bag
of
barley
lenore
did
not
recognize
him
he
looked
rugged
and
honest
and
beamed
upon
her
watch
out
fer
yer
dress
he
said
pointing
with
grimy
hand
to
the
dusty
wheels
and
braces
so
near
her
let
me
drive
bill
she
asked
wal
now
i
wisht
i
could
he
replied
dryly
you
sure
can
drive
miss
but
drivin
ai
all
this
here
job
what
ca
i
do
i
bet
you
i
never
seen
a
girl
that
could
throw
anythin
straight
did
you
well
not
so
very
i
forgot
how
you
drove
the
horses
go
ahead
do
let
me
delay
the
harvest
bill
called
sonorously
to
his
twelve
horses
and
as
they
bent
and
strained
and
began
to
bob
their
heads
the
clattering
roar
filled
the
air
also
a
cloud
of
dust
and
thin
flying
streams
of
chaff
enveloped
lenore
the
high
stalks
of
barley
in
wide
sheets
fell
before
the
cutter
upon
an
apron
to
be
carried
by
feeders
into
the
body
of
the
machine
the
straw
denuded
of
its
grain
came
out
at
the
rear
to
be
dropped
while
the
grain
streamed
out
of
a
tube
on
the
side
next
to
lenore
to
fall
into
an
open
sack
it
made
a
short
shift
of
harvesting
lenore
liked
the
even
nodding
rhythm
of
the
plodding
horses
and
the
way
bill
threw
a
pebble
from
a
sack
on
his
seat
to
hit
this
or
that
horse
not
keeping
in
line
or
pulling
his
share
bill
aim
was
unerring
he
never
hit
the
wrong
horse
which
would
have
been
the
case
had
he
used
a
whip
the
grain
came
out
in
so
tiny
a
stream
that
lenore
wondered
how
a
bag
was
ever
filled
but
she
saw
presently
that
even
a
tiny
stream
if
running
steadily
soon
made
bulk
that
was
proof
of
the
value
of
small
things
even
atoms
no
marvel
was
it
that
bill
and
his
helper
were
as
grimy
as
stokers
of
a
furnace
lenore
began
to
choke
with
the
fine
dust
and
to
feel
her
eyes
smart
and
to
see
it
settle
on
her
hands
and
dress
she
then
had
appreciation
of
the
nature
of
a
day
for
workmen
cutting
eighteen
acres
of
barley
how
would
they
ever
cut
the
two
thousand
acres
of
wheat
no
wonder
many
men
were
needed
lenore
sympathized
with
the
operators
of
that
but
she
did
not
like
the
dirt
if
she
had
been
a
man
though
that
labor
hard
as
it
was
would
have
appealed
to
her
harvesting
the
grain
was
beautiful
whether
in
the
old
slow
method
of
threshing
or
with
one
of
these
modern
machines
she
jumped
off
and
the
big
ponderous
thing
almost
gifted
with
intelligence
it
seemed
to
lenore
rolled
on
with
its
whirring
roar
drawing
its
cloud
of
dust
and
leaving
behind
a
litter
of
straw
it
developed
then
that
adams
had
walked
along
with
the
machine
and
he
now
addressed
her
will
you
be
staying
here
till
your
father
comes
he
asked
no
adams
why
do
you
ask
you
ought
come
out
here
alone
or
go
back
alone
all
these
strange
men
some
of
them
hard
customers
you
excuse
me
miss
but
this
harvest
is
not
like
other
harvests
i
wait
for
my
father
and
i
not
go
out
of
sight
replied
lenore
thanking
the
foreman
for
his
thoughtfulness
she
walked
away
and
soon
she
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
first
the
grain
was
not
yet
ripe
but
near
at
hand
it
was
a
pale
gold
the
wind
out
of
the
west
waved
and
swept
the
wheat
while
the
almost
imperceptible
shadows
followed
a
road
half
overgrown
with
grass
and
goldenrod
bordered
the
and
it
wound
away
down
toward
the
house
her
father
appeared
mounted
on
the
white
horse
he
always
rode
lenore
sat
down
in
the
grass
to
wait
for
him
nodding
stalks
of
goldenrod
leaned
to
her
face
when
looked
at
closely
how
truly
gold
their
color
yet
it
was
not
such
a
gold
as
that
of
the
rich
blaze
of
ripe
wheat
she
was
admitting
to
her
consciousness
a
jealousy
of
anything
comparable
to
wheat
and
suddenly
she
confessed
that
her
natural
love
for
it
had
been
augmented
by
a
subtle
growing
sentiment
not
sentiment
about
the
war
or
the
need
of
the
allies
or
meaning
of
the
staff
of
life
she
had
sensed
young
dorn
passion
for
wheat
and
it
had
made
a
difference
to
her
no
use
lying
to
myself
she
soliloquized
i
think
of
him
i
help
it
i
ran
out
here
wild
restless
unable
to
reason
just
because
i
decided
to
see
him
again
to
make
sure
i
i
really
care
how
furious
how
ridiculous
i
feel
when
when
lenore
did
not
complete
her
thought
because
she
was
not
sure
nothing
could
be
any
truer
than
the
fact
that
she
had
no
idea
how
she
would
feel
she
began
sensitively
to
distrust
herself
she
who
had
always
been
so
sure
of
motives
so
contented
with
things
as
they
were
had
been
struck
by
an
absurd
fancy
that
haunted
because
it
was
fiercely
repudiated
and
scorned
that
would
give
her
no
rest
until
it
was
proven
false
but
suppose
it
were
true
a
succeeding
blankness
of
mind
awoke
to
the
of
hoofs
and
her
father
cheery
halloo
anderson
dismounted
and
throwing
his
bridle
he
sat
down
heavily
beside
her
you
can
ride
back
home
he
said
lenore
knew
she
had
been
reproved
for
her
wandering
out
there
and
she
made
a
motion
to
rise
his
big
hand
held
her
down
no
hurry
now
i
here
grand
day
ai
it
an
i
see
the
goin
them
sacks
look
good
to
me
lenore
waited
with
some
perturbation
she
had
a
guilty
conscience
and
she
feared
he
meant
to
quiz
her
about
her
sudden
change
of
front
regarding
the
bend
trip
so
she
could
not
look
up
and
she
could
not
say
a
word
jake
says
that
nash
has
been
tryin
to
make
up
to
you
any
sense
in
what
he
says
asked
her
father
bluntly
why
hardly
oh
i
noticed
nash
is
is
rather
fresh
as
rose
calls
it
replied
lenore
somewhat
relieved
at
this
unexpected
query
yes
he
been
makin
eyes
at
rose
she
told
me
replied
anderson
discharge

lenore
forcibly
so
i
ought

hopin
to
get
nash
dead
to
rights
what
more
do
you
want
she
demanded
i
mean
regardin
his
relation
to
the
listen
here
the
point
nash
has
been
tracked
an
caught
in
secret
talks
with
prominent
men
in
this
country
men
of
foreign
blood
an
mebbe
foreign
sympathies
we
at
the
start
of
big
an
bad
times
in
the
good
old
no
one
can
tell
how
bad
well
you
know
my
position
in
the
golden
valley

to
reckon

guns
right
now
an
you
bet
jake
is
packin
the
same
we
do
travel
far
apart
any
more
this
summer
lenore
had
started
shudderingly
and
her
look
showed
her
voiceless
fear
you
need
tell
your
mother
he
went
on
more
intimately
i
can
trust
you
an
to
come
back
to
nash
he
an
this
glidden
you
remember
one
of
those
men
at
dorn

they
are
usin
gold
they
must
have
barrels
of
it
if
i
could
find
out
where
that
gold
comes
from
probably
they
do
know
but
i
might
find
out
if
men
here
in
our
own
country
are
hatchin
plots
with
the
plots
what
for
queried
lenore
breathlessly
to
destroy
my
wheat
to
drive
off
or
bribe
the
to
cripple
the
crop
yield
in
the
northwest
to
draw
the
militia
here
in
short
to
harass
an
weaken
an
slow
down
our
government
in
its
preparation
against
germany
why
that
is
terrible
declared
lenore
i
a
hunch
from
jake
there
a
whisper
of
a
plot
to
put
me
out
of
the
way
said
anderson
darkly
oh
good
heavens

do
mean
it
cried
lenore
distractedly
sure
i
do
but
that
no
way
for
anderson
daughter
to
take
it
our
women

got
to
fight
too
we

weapons

with
a
passionate
little
cry

moonstruck
girl

my
father
anderson
muttered
low
under
his
breath
and
his
big
hand
snapped
hard
at
the
nodding
goldenrod
for
my
sake
to
help
me
you
encourage
nash
flirt
with
him
a
little
find
out

could
yes
i
would
she
cried
deliberately
but
she
wanted
to
cover
her
face
with
her
hands
she
trembled
slightly
then
grew
cold
with
a
sickening
disgust
at
this
strange
new
uprising
self
wait
a
minute
before
you
say
too
much
went
on
anderson
you
my
child
my
lenore
the
lass
i
been
so
proud
of
all
my
life
i
spill
blood
to
avenge
an
insult
to
you
but
lenore
entered
upon
a
terrible
war
people
out
here
especially
the
women
do
realize
it
yet
but
you
must
realize
it
when
i
said
to
jim
my
son
i
i
felt
i
never
look
upon
his
face
again
i
gave
him
up
i
could
have
held
him
back
got
exemption
for
him
but

safety
and
happiness
and
prosperity

rose
an
kathleen

every
loyal
woman

love
our
own
country
an
i
ask
you
to
see
as
i
see
the
terrible
danger
to
that
country
think
of
you
an
rose
an
kathleen
bein
treated
like
those
poor
belgian
girls
well
you
get
that
an
worse
if
the
germans
won
this
war
an
the
point
is
for
us
to
win
every
last
one
of
us
must
fight
sacrifice
to
that
end
an
hang
together
anderson
paused
huskily
and
swallowed
hard
while
he
looked
away
across
the
fields
lenore
felt
herself
drawn
by
an
irresistible
power
the
west
wind
rustled
through
the
waving
wheat
she
heard
the
whir
of
the
threshers
yet
all
seemed
unreal
her
father
passion
had
made
this
place
another
world
so
much
for
that
resumed
anderson
i
goin
to
do
my
best
an
i
may
make
blunders
i
play
the
game
as
it
dealt
out
to
me
lord
knows
i
feel
all
in
the
dark
but
it
the
nature
of
the
effort
the
spirit
that
count
i
goin
to
save
most
of
the
wheat
on
my
ranches
an
bein
a
westerner
who
can
see
ahead
i
know
there
to
be
blood
spilled
i
give
a
lot
to
know
who
sent
this
nash
on
me
i
satisfied
now
he
an
agent
a
spy
a
plotter
for
a
gang
that
marked
me
i
ca
prove
it
yet
but
i
feel
it
maybe
worth
while
worth
the
trouble
will
ever
be
found
out
from
him
but
i
do
figure
that
way
i
say
play

game

take
a
chance
if
you
encouraged
nash
you
probably

out
all
about
him
the
worst
of
it
is
could
you
be
slick
enough

a
girl
as
fine
an
square
as
you

man
even

scoundrel
like

reckon

considerin
the
motive
women

wonderful
well
if
you
can
fool

winner

consent

of

for

now
the
question
is
can

do
it
yes
whispered
lenore
good
exploded
anderson
in
a
great
relief
then
he
began
to
mop
his
wet
face
he
arose
showing
the
weight
of
heavy
guns
in
his
pockets
and
he
gazed
across
the
that
wheat
be
ripe
in
a
week
it
sure
looks
fine
lenore
you
ride
back
home
now
do
let
jake
pump

he
powerful
curious
an
i
go
give
these
a
first
dose
of
anderson
he
turned
away
without
looking
at
her
and
he
hesitated
bending
over
to
pluck
a
stem
of
goldenrod
lass
you
you
like
your
mother
he
said
unsteadily
an
she
helped
me

my
struggle
here
you
brave
an
you
big
lenore
wanted
to
say
something
to
show
her
feeling
to
make
her
task
seem
lighter
but
she
could
not
speak
we
pards
now
with
no
secrets
he
continued
with
a
different
note
in
his
voice
an
i
want
you
to
know
that
it
ai
likely
nash
or
glidden
will
get
out
of
this
country
alive
chapter
vii
three
days
later
lenore
accompanied
her
father
on
the
ride
to
the
bend
country
she
sat
in
the
back
seat
of
the
car
with
jake
an
arrangement
very
gratifying
to
the
cowboy
but
received
with
displeasure
by
the
driver
nash
they
had
arranged
to
start
at
sunrise
and
it
became
manifest
that
nash
had
expected
lenore
to
sit
beside
him
all
during
the
long
ride
it
was
her
father
however
who
took
the
front
seat
and
behind
nash
back
he
had
slyly
winked
at
lenore
as
if
to
compliment
her
on
the
evident
success
of
their
deep
plot
lenore
at
the
first
opportunity
that
presented
shot
nash
a
warning
glance
which
was
sincere
enough
jake
had
begun
to
use
keen
eyes
and
there
was
no
telling
what
he
might
do
the
morning
was
cool
sweet
fresh
with
a
red
sun
presaging
a
hot
day
the
big
car
hummed
like
a
droning
bee
and
seemed
to
cover
the
miles
as
if
by
magic
lenore
sat
with
face
uncovered
enjoying
the
breeze
and
the
endless
colorful
scene
flashing
by
listening
to
jake
amusing
comments
and
trying
to
keep
back
thought
of
what
discovery
might
await
her
before
the
end
of
this
day
once
across
the
copper
river
they
struck
the
gradual
ascent
and
here
the
temperature
began
to
mount
and
the
dust
to
fly
lenore
drew
her
veils
close
and
leaning
comfortably
back
she
resigned
herself
to
wait
and
to
endure
by
the
flight
of
a
crow
it
was
about
a
hundred
miles
from
ranch
to
palmer
but
by
the
roads
necessary
to
take
the
distance
was
a
great
deal
longer
lenore
was
well
aware
when
they
got
up
on
the
desert
and
the
time
came
when
she
thought
she
would
suffocate
there
appeared
to
be
intolerable
hours
in
which
no
one
spoke
and
only
the
hum
and
creak
of
the
machine
throbbed
in
her
ears
she
could
not
see
through
her
veils
and
did
not
part
them
until
a
stop
was
made
at
palmer
her
father
got
out
sputtering
and
gasping
shaking
the
dust
in
clouds
from
his
long
linen
coat
jake
who
always
said
he
lived
on
dust
and
heat
averred
it
was
not
exactly
a
regular
fine
day
lenore
looked
out
trying
to
get
a
breath
of
air
nash
busied
himself
with
the
hot
engine
the
little
country
town
appeared
dead
and
buried
under
dust
there
was
not
a
person
in
sight
nor
a
sound
to
be
heard
the
sky
resembled
molten
lead
with
a
blazing
center
too
bright
for
the
gaze
of
man
anderson
and
jake
went
into
the
little
hotel
to
get
some
refreshments
lenore
preferred
to
stay
in
the
car
saying
she
wanted
only
a
cool
drink
the
moment
the
two
men
were
out
of
sight
nash
straightened
up
to
gaze
darkly
and
hungrily
at
lenore
this
a
good
a
chance
as
we
get
he
said
in
an
eager
hurried
whisper
for
what
asked
lenore
aghast
to
run
off
he
replied
huskily
lenore
had
proceeded
so
cleverly
to
carry
out
her
scheme
that
in
three
days
nash
had
begun
to
implore
and
demand
that
she
elope
with
him
he
had
been
so
much
of
a
fool
but
she
as
yet
had
found
out
but
little
about
him
his
right
name
was
ruenke
he
was
a
socialist
he
had
plenty
of
money
and
hinted
of
mysterious
sources
for
more
at
this
lenore
hid
her
face
and
while
she
fell
back
in
pretended
distress
she
really
wanted
to
laugh
she
had
learned
something
new
in
these
few
days
and
that
was
to
hate
oh
no
no
she
murmured
i
i
ca
think
of
that
yet
but
why
not
he
demanded
in
shrill
violence
his
gloved
hand
clenched
on
the
tool
he
held
mother
has
been
so
unhappy
with
my
brother
jim
off
to
the
war
i
i
just
could
now
harry
you
must
give
me
time
it
all
so
so
sudden
please
wait
nash
appeared
divided
between
two
emotions
lenore
watched
him
from
behind
her
parted
veil
she
had
been
astonished
to
find
out
that
side
by
side
with
her
intense
disgust
and
shame
at
the
part
she
was
playing
there
was
a
strong
keen
passionate
interest
in
it
owing
to
the
fact
that
though
she
could
prove
little
against
this
man
her
intuition
had
sensed
his
secret
deadly
antagonism
toward
her
father
by
little
significant
mannerisms
and
revelations
he
had
more
and
more
betrayed
the
german
in
him
she
saw
it
in
his
overbearing
conceit
his
almost
instant
assumption
that
he
was
her
master
at
first
lenore
feared
him
but
as
she
learned
to
hate
him
she
lost
her
fear
she
had
never
been
alone
with
him
except
under
such
circumstances
as
this
and
she
had
decided
she
would
not
be
wait
he
was
expostulating
but
it
going
to
get
hot
for
me
oh
what
do
you
mean
she
begged
you
frighten
me
lenore
the
will
have
hard
sledding
in
this
wheat
country
i
belong
to
that
i
told
you
but
the
union
is
run
differently
this
summer
and
i
got
work
to
do
that
i
do
like
since
i
fell
in
love
with
you
come
run
off
with
me
and
i
give
it
up
lenore
trembled
at
this
admission
she
appeared
to
be
close
upon
further
discovery
harry
how
wildly
you
talk
she
exclaimed
i
hardly
know
you
you
frighten
me
with
your
mysterious
talk
have
a
a
little
consideration
for
me
nash
strode
back
to
lean
into
the
car
behind
his
huge
goggles
his
eyes
gleamed
his
gloved
hand
closed
hard
on
her
arm
it
is
sudden
it
got
to
be
sudden
he
said
in
fierce
undertone
you
must
trust
me
i
will
but
you
must
confide
in
me
she
replied
earnestly
i
not
quite
a
fool
you
rushing
me
too
too
suddenly
he
released
her
threw
up
his
hand
then
quickly
stepped
back
to
the
front
of
the
car
jake
stood
in
the
door
of
the
hotel
he
had
seen
that
action
of
nash
then
anderson
appeared
followed
by
a
boy
carrying
a
glass
of
water
for
lenore
they
approached
the
car
jake
sauntering
last
with
his
curious
gaze
on
nash
go
in
an
get
a
bite
an
a
drink
said
anderson
to
the
driver
hurry
nash
obeyed
jake
eyes
never
left
him
until
he
entered
the
door
then
jake
stepped
in
beside
lenore
thet
water
wet
anyhow
he
drawled
we
get
a
good
cold
drink
at
dorn
said
anderson
lass
how
are
you
makin
it
fine
she
replied
smiling
so
i
seen
significantly
added
jake
with
a
piercing
glance
at
her
lenore
realized
then
that
she
would
have
to
confide
in
jake
or
run
the
risk
of
having
violence
done
to
nash
so
she
nodded
wisely
at
the
cowboy
and
winked
mischievously
and
taking
advantage
of
anderson
entering
the
car
she
whispered
in
jake
ear
i
finding
out
things
tell
you
later
the
cowboy
looked
anything
but
convinced
and
he
glanced
with
narrowed
eyes
at
nash
as
that
worthy
hurried
back
to
the
car
with
a
lurch
and
a
leap
the
car
left
palmer
behind
in
a
cloud
of
dust
the
air
was
oppressive
and
exceedingly
dry
lenore
lips
smarted
so
that
she
continually
moistened
them
on
all
sides
stretched
dreary
parched
anderson
shook
his
head
sadly
jake
said
ai
thet
too
bad
not
half
growed
an
sure
too
late
now
near
at
hand
lenore
saw
the
short
immature
wheat
and
she
realized
that
it
was
ruined
it
been
gettin
worse
jake
remarked
anderson
most
of
this
be
cut
at
all
an
what
is
cut
wo
yield
seedlings
i
see
a
yellow
patch
here
an
there
on
the
north
slopes
but
on
the
most
part
the
bend
a
failure
father
you
remember
dorn
section
that
promised
so
well
asked
lenore
yes
but
it
promised
only
in
case
of
rain
i
look
for
the
worst
replied
anderson
regretfully
it
looks
like
over
there
said
lenore
pointing
far
ahead
through
the
drifting
veils
of
heat
far
across
the
bare
dreamy
hills
of
fallow
and
the
blasted
fields
of
wheat
stood
up
some
huge
white
columnar
clouds
a
vivid
contrast
to
the
coppery
sky
by
george
there
a
thunderhead
exclaimed
anderson
jake
what
do
you
make
of
that
looks
good
to
me
replied
jake
who
was
always
hopeful
lenore
bore
the
hot
wind
and
the
fine
choking
dust
without
covering
her
face
she
wanted
to
see
all
the
hills
and
valleys
of
this
desert
of
wheat
her
heart
beat
a
little
faster
as
looking
across
that
waste
on
waste
of
heroic
labor
she
realized
she
was
nearing
the
end
of
a
ride
that
might
be
momentous
for
her
the
very
aspect
of
that
wide
treeless
expanse
with
all
its
overwhelming
meaning
seemed
to
make
her
a
stronger
and
more
thoughtful
girl
if
those
endless
were
indeed
ruined
what
a
pity
what
a
tragedy
not
only
would
young
dorn
be
ruined
but
perhaps
many
other
toiling
farmers
somehow
lenore
felt
no
hopeless
certainty
of
ruin
for
the
young
man
in
whom
she
was
interested
there
on
that
slope
spoke
up
anderson
pointing
to
a
field
which
was
yellow
in
contrast
to
the
surrounding
gray
field
there
a
of
fair
wheat
but
such
tinges
of
harvest
gold
were
not
many
in
half
a
dozen
miles
of
dreary
hills
where
were
the
beautiful
shadows
in
the
wheat
wondered
lenore
not
a
breath
of
wind
appeared
to
stir
across
those
fields
as
the
car
neared
the
top
of
a
hill
the
road
curved
into
another
and
lenore
saw
a
dusty
flash
of
another
car
passing
on
ahead
suddenly
jake
leaned
forward
boss
i
seen
somethin
throwed
out
of
thet
car
into
the
wheat
he
said
what
mebbe
it
was
a
bottle
replied
anderson
peering
ahead
nope
sure
was
thet
there
i
seen
it
again
watch
boss
lenore
strained
her
eyes
and
felt
a
stir
of
her
pulses
jake
voice
was
perturbing
was
it
strange
that
nash
slowed
up
a
little
where
there
was
no
apparent
need
then
lenore
saw
a
hand
flash
out
of
the
side
of
the
car
ahead
and
throw
a
small
glinting
object
into
the
wheat
there
seen
it
again
said
jake
i
saw
jake
mark
that
spot
nash
slow
down
yelled
anderson
lenore
gathered
from
the
look
of
her
father
and
the
cowboy
that
something
was
amiss
but
she
could
not
guess
what
it
might
be
nash
bent
sullenly
at
his
task
of
driving
i
reckon
about
here
said
jake
waving
his
hand
stop
her
ordered
anderson
and
as
the
car
came
to
a
halt
he
got
out
followed
by
jake
wal
i
marked
it
by
thet
rock
declared
the
cowboy
so
did
i
responded
anderson
let
get
over
the
fence
an
find
what
it
was
they
threw
in
there
jake
rested
a
lean
hand
on
a
post
and
vaulted
the
fence
but
anderson
had
to
climb
laboriously
and
painfully
over
the
obstruction
lenore
marveled
at
his
silence
and
his
persistence
anderson
hated
wire
fences
presently
he
got
over
and
then
he
divided
his
time
between
searching
in
the
wheat
and
peering
after
the
strange
car
that
was
drawing
far
away
lenore
saw
jake
pick
up
something
and
scrutinize
it
i
be
he
muttered
then
he
approached
anderson
what
is
thet
jake
you
can
lambaste
me
if
i
ever
saw
the
likes
replied
anderson
but
it
looks
bad
let
rustle
after
that
car
as
anderson
clambered
into
his
seat
once
more
he
looked
dark
and
grim
catch
that
car
ahead
he
tersely
ordered
nash
whereupon
the
driver
began
to
go
through
his
usual
motions
in
starting
lenore
what
do
you
make
of
this
queried
anderson
turning
to
show
her
a
small
cake
of
some
gray
substance
soft
and
wet
to
the
touch
i
do
know
what
it
is
replied
lenore
wonderingly
do
you
no
an
i
give
a
lot
say
nash
hurry
overhaul
that
car
anderson
turned
to
see
why
his
order
had
not
been
obeyed
he
looked
angry
nash
made
hurried
motions
the
car
trembled
the
machinery
began
to
whir
then
came
a
tremendous
buzzing
roar
a
violent
shaking
of
the
car
followed
by
sharp
explosions
and
silence
you
stripped
the
gears
shouted
anderson
with
the
red
fading
out
of
his
face
no
but
something
wrong
replied
nash
he
got
out
to
examine
the
engine
anderson
manifestly
controlled
strong
feeling
lenore
saw
jake
hand
go
to
her
father
shoulder
boss
he
whispered
we
ca
ketch
thet
car
now
anderson
resigned
himself
averted
his
face
so
that
he
could
not
see
nash
who
was
tinkering
with
the
engine
lenore
believed
then
that
nash
had
deliberately
stalled
the
engine
or
disordered
something
so
as
to
permit
the
escape
of
the
strange
car
ahead
she
saw
it
turn
off
the
long
straight
road
ahead
and
disappear
to
the
right
after
some
minutes
delay
nash
resumed
his
seat
and
started
the
car
once
more
from
the
top
of
the
next
hill
lenore
saw
the
dorn
farm
and
home
all
the
wheat
looked
parched
she
remembered
however
that
the
section
of
promising
grain
lay
on
the
north
slope
and
therefore
out
of
sight
from
where
she
was
looks
as
bad
as
any
said
anderson
to
my
money
lenore
shut
her
eyes
and
thought
of
herself
her
inward
state
she
seemed
calm
and
glad
to
have
that
first
part
of
the
journey
almost
ended
her
motive
in
coming
was
not
now
the
impelling
thing
that
had
actuated
her
when
next
the
car
slowed
down
she
heard
her
father
say
drive
in
by
the
house
then
lenore
opening
her
eyes
saw
the
gate
the
trim
little
orchard
with
its
scant
shade
the
gray
old
weatherbeaten
house
which
she
remembered
so
well
the
big
porch
looked
inviting
as
it
was
shady
and
held
an
old
and
a
bench
with
blue
cushions
a
door
stood
wide
open
no
one
appeared
to
be
on
the
premises
nash
blow
your
horn
an
then
hunt
around
for
somebody
said
anderson
come
get
out
lenore
you
must
be
half
dead
oh
no
only
half
dust
and
half
fire
replied
lenore
laughing
as
she
stepped
out
what
a
relief
to
get
rid
of
coat
veils
bonnet
and
to
sit
on
a
shady
porch
where
a
faint
breeze
blew
just
at
that
instant
she
heard
a
low
distant
rumbling
thunder
it
thrilled
her
jake
brought
her
a
cold
refreshing
drink
and
she
sent
him
back
after
another
she
wet
her
handkerchief
and
bathed
her
hot
face
it
was
indeed
very
comfortable
there
after
that
long
hot
ride
miss
lenore
i
seen
thet
nash
pawin
you
said
the
cowboy
an
by
gosh
i
could
believe

eyes

so
loud

young
gentleman

in
love
with
him
replied
lenore
wall
i
remove
his
imagining
declared
jake
coolly
jake
you
will
do
nothing
ahuh
then
you
air
in
love
with
lenore
was
compelled
to
explain
to
this
loyal
cowboy
just
what
the
situation
meant
whereupon
jake
swore
his
amaze
and
said
i
to
lick
him
anyhow
fer
thet
and
he
caught
up
the
tin
cup
and
shuffled
away
footsteps
and
voices
sounded
on
the
path
upon
which
presently
appeared
anderson
and
young
dorn
father
gone
to
wheatly
he
was
saying
but
i
glad
to
tell
you
we
pay
twenty
thousand
dollars
on
the
debt
as
soon
as
we
harvest
if
it
rains
we
pay
it
all
and
have
thirty
thousand
left
good
i
sure
hope
it
rains
an
that
thunder
sounds
hopeful
responded
anderson
it
been
hopeful
like
that
for
several
days
but
no
rain
said
dorn
and
then
espying
lenore
he
seemed
startled
out
of
his
eagerness
he
flushed
slightly
i
i
did
see
you
had
brought
your
daughter
he
greeted
her
somewhat
bashfully
and
lenore
returned
the
greeting
calmly
watching
him
steadily
and
waiting
for
the
nameless
sensations
she
had
imagined
would
attend
this
meeting
but
whatever
these
might
be
they
did
not
come
to
overwhelm
her
the
gladness
of
his
voice
as
he
had
spoken
so
eagerly
to
her
father
about
the
debt
had
made
her
feel
very
kindly
toward
him
it
might
have
been
natural
for
a
young
man
to
resent
this
dragging
debt
but
he
was
fine
she
observed
as
he
sat
down
that
once
the
smile
and
flush
left
his
face
he
seemed
somewhat
thinner
and
older
than
she
had
pictured
him
a
shadow
lay
in
his
eyes
and
his
lips
were
sad
he
had
evidently
been
working
upon
their
arrival
he
wore
overalls
dusty
and
ragged
his
arms
bare
to
the
elbow
were
brown
and
muscular
his
thin
cotton
shirt
was
wet
with
sweat
and
it
clung
to
his
powerful
shoulders
anderson
surveyed
the
young
man
with
friendly
glance
what
your
first
name
he
queried
with
his
blunt
frankness
kurt
was
the
reply
is
that
american
no
neither
is
dorn
but
kurt
dorn
is
an
american
hum
so
i
see
an
i
powerful
glad
an
you
saved
the
big
section
of
promisin
wheat
yes
we
been
lucky
it
the
best
and
finest
wheat
father
ever
raised
if
it
rains
the
yield
will
go
sixty
bushels
to
the
acre
sixty
whew
ejaculated
anderson
lenore
smiled
at
these
wheat
men
and
said
it
surely
will
rain
and
likely
storm
i
am
a
prophet
who
never
fails
by
george
that
true
lenore
has
anybody
beat
when
it
comes
to
figurin
the
weather
declared
anderson
dorn
looked
at
her
without
speaking
but
his
smile
seemed
to
say
that
she
could
not
help
being
a
prophet
of
good
of
hope
of
joy
say
lenore
how
many
bushels
in
a
section
at
sixty
per
acre
went
on
anderson
thousand
four
hundred
replied
lenore
an
what
you
sell
for
asked
anderson
of
dorn
father
has
sold
at
two
dollars
and
cents
a
bushel
replied
dorn
good
but
he
ought
to
have
waited
the
government
will
set
a
higher
price
how
much
will
that
come
to
lenore
dorn
smile
as
he
watched
lenore
do
her
mental
arithmetic
attested
to
the
fact
that
he
already
had
figured
out
the
sum
thousand
four
hundred
dollars
replied
lenore
is
that
right
an
you
have
thirty
thousand
dollars
left
after
all
debts
are
paid
inquired
anderson
yes
sir
i
can
hardly
realize
it
that
a
fortune
for
one
section
of
wheat
but
we
had
four
bad
seasons
oh
if
it
only
rains
lenore
turned
her
cheek
to
the
faint
west
wind
and
then
she
looked
long
at
the
slowly
spreading
clouds
white
and
beautiful
high
up
near
the
and
dark
and
forbidding
down
along
the
horizon
i
knew
a
girl
who
could
feel
things
move
when
no
one
else
could
said
lenore
i
sensitive
like
that
at
least
about
wind
and
rain
right
now
i
can
feel
rain
in
the
air
then
you
have
brought
me
luck
said
dorn
earnestly
indeed
i
guess
my
luck
has
turned
i
hated
the
idea
of
going
away
with
that
debt
unpaid
are
you
going
away
asked
lenore
in
surprise
yes
rather
he
replied
with
a
short
sardonic
laugh
he
fumbled
in
a
pocket
of
his
overalls
and
drew
forth
a
paper
which
he
opened
a
flame
burned
the
fairness
from
his
face
his
eyes
darkened
and
shone
with
peculiar
intensity
of
pride
i
was
the
first
man
drafted
in
this
bend
country
my
number
was
the
first
called
drafted
echoed
lenore
and
she
seemed
to
be
standing
on
the
threshold
of
an
amazing
and
terrible
truth
lass
we
forget
said
her
father
rather
thickly
oh
but
why
cried
lenore
she
had
voiced
the
same
poignant
appeal
to
her
brother
jim
why
need
he
why
must
he
go
to
war
what
for
and
jim
had
called
out
a
bitter
curse
on
the
germans
he
meant
to
kill
why
returned
dorn
with
the
sad
thoughtful
shadow
returning
to
his
eyes
how
many
times
have
i
asked
myself
that
in
one
way
i
know
i
have
told
father
yet
it
not
for
his
sake
but
when
i
think
deeply
when
i
can
feel
and
see
i
mean
i
going
for
my
country
for
you
and
your
sisters
like
a
soldier
then
lenore
received
her
mortal
blow
facing
him
who
dealt
it
and
it
was
a
sudden
overwhelming
realization
of
love
no
confusion
no
embarrassment
no
shame
attended
the
agony
of
that
revelation
outwardly
she
did
not
seem
to
change
at
all
she
felt
her
father
eyes
upon
her
but
she
had
no
wish
to
hide
the
tumult
of
her
heart
the
moment
made
her
a
woman
where
was
the
fulfilment
of
those
vague
stingingly
sweet
dreamy
fancies
of
love
where
was
her
maiden
reserve
that
she
so
boldly
recognized
an
unsolicited
passion
her
eyes
met
dorn
steadily
and
she
felt
some
vital
and
compelling
spirit
pass
from
her
to
him
she
saw
him
struggle
with
what
he
could
not
understand
it
was
his
glance
that
wavered
and
fell
his
hand
that
trembled
his
breast
that
heaved
she
loved
him
there
had
been
no
beginning
always
he
had
lived
in
her
dreams
and
like
her
brother
he
was
going
to
kill
and
to
be
killed
then
lenore
gazed
away
across
the
the
shadows
came
waving
toward
her
a
stronger
breeze
fanned
her
cheeks
the
heavens
were
darkening
and
low
thunder
rolled
along
the
battlements
of
the
great
clouds
say
kurt
what
do
you
make
of
this
asked
anderson
lenore
turning
saw
her
father
hold
out
the
little
gray
cake
that
jake
had
found
in
the
young
dorn
seized
it
quickly
felt
and
smelled
and
bit
it
where
you
get
this
he
asked
with
excitement
anderson
related
the
circumstance
of
its
discovery
it
a
preparation
mostly
phosphorus
replied
dorn
when
the
moisture
evaporates
it
will
ignite
set
fire
to
any
dry
substance
that
is
a
trick
of
the
to
burn
the
by
all
that
swore
anderson
with
his
jaw
bulging
jake
an
i
knew
it
meant
bad
but
we
did
know
what
i
been
expecting
tricks
of
all
kinds
said
dorn
i
have
four
men
watching
the
section
good
say
that
car
turned
off
to
the
right
back
here
some
miles
but
worse
luck
the
can
work
at
night
we
watch
at
night
too
replied
dorn
lenore
was
conscious
of
anger
encroaching
upon
the
melancholy
splendor
of
her
emotions
and
the
change
was
bitter
when
the
rain
comes
wo
it
counteract
the
ignition
of
that
phosphorus
she
asked
eagerly
for
she
knew
that
rain
would
come
only
for
the
time
being
it
be
just
as
dry
this
time
as
it
is
now
then
the
wheat
goin
to
burn
declared
anderson
grimly
if
that
trick
has
been
worked
all
over
this
country
you
goin
to
have
worse
a
prairie
fire
the
job
on
hand
is
to
save
this
one
section
that
has
a
fortune
tied
up
in
it
anderson
that
job
looks
almost
hopeless
in
the
light
of
this
phosphorus
trick
what
on
earth
can
be
done
i
four
men
i
ca
hire
any
more
because
i
ca
trust
these
strangers
and
how
can
four
men
or
five
counting
me
watch
a
square
mile
of
wheat
day
and
night
the
situation
looked
hopeless
to
lenore
and
she
was
sick
what
cruel
fates
toyed
with
this
young
farmer
he
seemed
to
be
sinking
under
this
last
crowning
blow
there
in
the
sky
rolling
up
and
rumbling
was
the
that
meant
freedom
from
debt
and
a
fortune
besides
but
of
what
avail
the
rain
if
it
was
to
rush
the
wheat
to
full
bursting
measure
only
for
the
infernal
touch
of
the
foreigner
anderson
however
was
no
longer
a
boy
he
had
dealt
with
many
and
many
a
trial
never
was
he
plunged
into
despair
until
after
the
dread
crisis
had
come
to
pass
his
red
forehead
frowning
and
ridged
with
swelling
showed
the
bent
of
his
mind
oh
it
is
hard
said
lenore
to
dorn
i
so
sorry
but
do
give
up
while
there
life
there
hope
he
looked
up
with
tears
in
his
eyes
thank
you
i
did
weaken
you
see
i
let
myself
believe
too
much
for
dad
sake
i
do
care
about
the
money
for
myself
money
what
good
will
money
be
to
me
now
it
over
for
me
to
get
the
wheat
cut
harvested
that
all
i
hoped
the
army
war
france
i
go
to
be
hush
whispered
lenore
and
she
put
a
soft
hand
upon
his
lips
checking
the
end
of
that
bitter
speech
she
felt
him
start
and
the
look
she
met
pierced
her
soul
hush
it
going
to
rain
father
will
find
some
way
to
save
the
wheat
and
you
are
coming
home
after
the
war
he
crushed
her
hand
to
his
hot
lips
you
make
me
ashamed
i
wo
give
up
he
said
brokenly
and
when
i
over
there
in
the
trenches
i
think
dorn
listen
to
this
rang
out
anderson
we
fool
that
gang
to
rain
so
far
so
good
you
take
this
cake
of
phosphorus
an
ride
around
all
over
the
country
show
it
tell
the
farmers
their
wheat
goin
to
burn
an
offer
them
whose
fields
are
already
ruined
that
fire
ca
do
no
more
harm
offer
them
big
money
to
help
you
save
your
section
half
a
hundred
men
could
put
out
a
fire
if
one
did
start
an
these
neighbors
of
yours
some
of
them
will
jump
at
a
chance
to
beat
the
boy
it
can
be
done
he
ended
with
a
big
fist
held
aloft
in
triumph
see
did
i
tell
you
murmured
lenore
softly
it
touched
her
deeply
to
see
dorn
respond
to
hope
his
haggard
face
suddenly
warmed
and
glowed
i
never
thought
of
that
he
burst
out
radiantly
we
can
save
the
wheat
anderson
i
i
ca
thank
you
enough
do
try
replied
the
rancher
i
tell
you
it
will
rain
cried
lenore
gaily
let
walk
out
there
watch
the
storm
come
across
the
hills
i
love
to
see
the
shadows
blow
over
the
wheat
lenore
became
aware
as
she
passed
the
car
that
nash
was
glaring
at
her
in
no
unmistakable
manner
she
had
forgotten
all
about
him
the
sight
of
his
jealous
face
somehow
added
to
her
strange
exhilaration
they
crossed
the
road
from
the
house
and
facing
the
west
had
free
prospect
of
the
miles
of
billowy
hills
and
the
magnificent
ordnance
of
the
the
deep
low
mutterings
of
thunder
seemed
a
grand
and
welcome
music
lenore
stole
a
look
at
dorn
to
see
him
bareheaded
face
upturned
entranced
it
was
only
a
coming
down
in
the
valley
country
such
storms
were
frequent
at
this
season
too
common
for
their
meaning
to
be
appreciated
here
in
the
desert
of
wheat
rain
was
a
blessing
life
itself
the
rounded
edge
of
the
approaching
clouds
came
and
coalesced
spread
and
mushroomed
under
them
the
body
of
the
storm
was
purple
lit
now
and
then
by
a
flash
of
lightning
long
drifting
veils
of
rain
gray
as
thin
fog
hung
suspended
between
sky
and
earth
listen
exclaimed
dorn
a
warm
wind
laden
with
dry
scent
of
wheat
struck
lenore
face
and
waved
her
hair
it
brought
a
silken
sweeping
rustle
a
whispering
of
the
bearded
grain
the
soft
sound
thrilled
lenore
it
seemed
a
sweet
hopeful
message
that
waiting
had
been
rewarded
that
the
drought
could
be
broken
again
and
more
beautiful
than
ever
before
in
her
life
she
saw
the
waves
of
shadow
as
they
came
forward
over
the
wheat
rippling
like
breezes
over
the
surface
of
a
golden
lake
they
came
in
long
broken
lines
moving
following
changing
until
the
whole
seemed
in
shadowy
motion
the
cloud
pageant
rolled
on
above
and
beyond
lenore
felt
a
sweet
drop
of
rain
splash
upon
her
upturned
face
it
seemed
like
a
caress
there
came
a
pattering
around
her
suddenly
rose
a
damp
faint
smell
of
dust
beyond
the
hill
showed
a
gray
pall
of
rain
coming
slowly
charged
with
a
low
roar
the
whisper
of
the
sweeping
wheat
was
swallowed
up
lenore
stood
her
ground
until
heavy
rain
drops
fell
thick
and
fast
upon
her
sinking
through
her
thin
waist
to
thrill
her
flesh
and
then
with
a
last
gay
call
to
those
two
man
lovers
of
wheat
and
storms
she
ran
for
the
porch
there
they
joined
her
anderson
puffing
and
smiling
dorn
still
with
that
rapt
look
upon
his
face
the
rain
swept
up
and
roared
on
the
roof
while
all
around
was
streaked
gray
boy
there
your
rain
shouted
anderson
but
dorn
did
not
hear
once
he
smiled
at
lenore
as
if
she
were
the
good
fairy
who
had
brought
about
this
miracle
in
his
look
lenore
had
deeper
realization
of
him
of
nature
and
of
life
she
loved
rain
but
always
thenceforth
she
would
reverence
it
fresh
cool
fragrance
of
a
renewed
soil
filled
the
air
all
that
dusty
gray
hue
of
the
earth
had
vanished
and
it
was
wet
and
green
and
bright
even
as
she
gazed
the
water
seemed
to
sink
in
as
it
fell
a
precious
relief
to
thirsty
soil
the
thunder
rolled
away
eastward
and
the
storm
passed
the
thin
clouds
following
soon
cleared
away
from
the
western
sky
and
blue
with
a
rainbow
curving
down
to
bury
its
exquisite
hues
in
the
golden
wheat
chapter
viii
the
journey
homeward
held
many
incalculable
differences
from
the
uncertain
doubts
and
fears
that
had
tormented
lenore
on
the
outward
trip
for
a
long
time
she
felt
the
warm
tight
clasp
of
dorn
hand
on
hers
as
he
had
said
very
evidently
he
believed
that
was
to
be
his
last
sight
of
her
lenore
would
never
forget
the
gaze
that
seemed
to
try
to
burn
her
image
on
his
memory
forever
she
felt
that
they
would
meet
again
solemn
thoughts
revolved
in
her
mind
still
she
was
not
unhappy
she
had
given
much
unsought
but
the
return
to
her
seemed
growing
every
moment
that
she
lived
the
dust
had
been
settled
by
the
rain
for
many
miles
however
beyond
palmer
there
began
to
show
evidences
that
the
storm
had
thinned
out
or
sheered
off
because
the
road
gradually
grew
dry
again
when
dust
rose
once
more
lenore
covered
her
face
although
obsessed
as
she
was
by
the
deep
change
in
herself
neither
dust
nor
heat
nor
distance
affected
her
greatly
like
the
miles
the
moments
sped
by
she
was
aware
through
closed
eyes
when
darkness
fell
stops
were
frequent
after
the
copper
river
had
been
crossed
and
her
father
appeared
to
meet
and
question
many
persons
in
the
towns
they
passed
most
of
his
questioning
pertained
to
the
and
even
excited
whispering
by
her
father
and
jake
had
no
power
to
interest
her
it
was
midnight
when
they
reached
many
waters
and
lenore
became
conscious
of
fatigue
nash
crowded
in
front
of
jake
as
she
was
about
to
step
out
and
assisted
her
he
gave
her
arm
a
hard
squeeze
and
fiercely
whispered
in
her
ear
the
whisper
was
trenchant
with
meaning
and
thoroughly
aroused
lenore
but
she
gave
no
sign
and
moved
away
i
seen
strangers
sneakin
off
in
the
dark
jake
was
whispering
to
anderson
keep
your
eyes
peeled
replied
anderson
i
take
lenore
up
to
the
house
an
come
back
it
was
pitch
black
up
the
path
through
the
grove
and
lenore
had
to
cling
to
her
father
is
there
any
danger
she
whispered
we
lookin
for
anythin
replied
anderson

foolish
risks

ranch

cowboys

jake
he
spots
some
prowlin
coyotes
the
minute
we
reach
home
anderson
unlocked
and
opened
the
door
the
hall
was
dark
and
quiet
he
turned
on
the
electric
light
lenore
was
detaching
her
veil
you
look
pale
he
said
solicitously
no
wonder
that
was
a
ride
but
i
glad
we
went
i
saved
dorn
wheat
i
glad
too
father
he
bade
her
and
went
out
locking
the
door
then
his
rapid
footsteps
died
away
wearily
lenore
climbed
the
stairs
and
went
to
her
room
she
was
awakened
from
deep
slumber
by
kathleen
who
pulled
and
tugged
at
her
lenorry
i
thought
you
was
dead
your
eyes
were
shut
so
tight
declared
the
child
breakfast
is
waiting
did
you
fetch
me
anything
yes
a
new
sister
replied
lenore
dreamily
kathleen
eyes
opened
wide
where
lenore
place
a
hand
over
her
heart
here
oh
you
do
look
funny
get
up
lenorry
did
you
hear
the
shooting
last
night
instantly
lenore
sat
up
and
stared
no
was
there
any
you
bet
but
i
do
know
what
it
was
all
about
lenore
dispelled
her
dreamy
state
and
hurriedly
dressing
she
went
down
to
breakfast
her
father
and
rose
were
still
at
the
table
hello
big
eyes
was
his
greeting
and
rose
not
to
be
outdone
chirped
hello
old
lenore
reply
lacked
her
usual
spontaneity
and
she
felt
if
she
did
not
explain
the
wideness
of
her
eyes
her
father
did
not
look
as
if
anything
worried
him
it
was
a
way
of
his
however
not
to
show
stress
or
worry
lenore
ate
in
silence
until
rose
left
the
and
then
she
asked
her
father
if
there
had
been
shooting
sure
he
replied
with
a
broad
smile
jake
turned
his
guns
loose
on
them
prowlin
men
last
night
by
george
you
ought
to
have
heard
them
run
one
plumped
into
the
gate
an
went
clear
over
it
to
fall
like
a
log
another
fell
into
the
brook
an
made
more
racket
than
a
horse
but
it
was
so
dark
we
could
catch
them
jake
shot
to
frighten
them
inquired
lenore
not
much
he
stung
one
that
sure
we
heard
a
cry
an
this
mornin
we
found
some
blood
what
do
you
suppose
these
these
night
visitors
wanted
no
tellin
jake
thinks
one
of
them
looked
an
walked
like
the
man
nash
has
been
meetin
anyway
we
not
takin
much
more
chance
on
nash
i
reckon
it
dangerous
keepin
him
around
i
have
him
drive
me
over
to
vale
an
then
to
huntington
you
can
go
along
be
your
last
chance
to
pump
him
have
you
found
out
anythin
lenore
told
what
had
transpired
between
her
and
the
driver
face
turned
fiery
red
that
ai
much
to
help
us
declared
angrily
but
it
shows
him
up
so
his
real
name
ruenke
fine
american
name
i
do
think
that
man
a
spy
an
a
plotter
an
before
he
another
day
older
goin
to
corner
him
it
a
sure
go
i
ca
hold
jake
in
any
longer
to
lenore
it
was
a
further
indication
of
her
father
temper
that
when
they
went
down
to
enter
the
car
he
addressed
nash
in
cool
careless
easy
speech
it
made
lenore
shiver
she
had
heard
stories
of
her
father
early
career
among
hard
men
jake
was
there
dry
caustic
with
keen
quiet
eyes
that
any
subtle
clever
man
would
have
feared
but
nash
thought
seemed
turned
mostly
inward
lenore
took
the
front
seat
in
the
car
beside
the
driver
he
showed
unconscious
response
to
that
action
jake
are
you
coming
she
asked
of
the
cowboy
wal
i
reckon
it
be
sure
dull
fer
you
without
me
nobody
to
talk
to
while
your
dad
fools
around
but
i
ca
go
me
an
the
boys
air
to
hang
some
this
mawnin
an
i
ca
miss
thet
fun
jake
drawled
his
speech
and
laughed
lazily
as
he
ended
it
he
was
just
boasting
as
usual
but
his
hawklike
eyes
were
on
nash
and
it
was
certain
that
nash
turned
pale
lenore
had
no
reply
to
make
her
father
appeared
to
lose
patience
with
jake
but
after
a
moment
hesitation
decided
not
to
voice
it
nash
was
not
a
good
nor
a
careful
driver
under
any
circumstances
and
this
morning
it
was
evident
he
did
not
have
his
mind
on
his
business
there
were
bumps
in
the
orchard
road
where
the
irrigation
ditches
crossed
say
you
ought
to
be
drivin
a
called
anderson
sarcastically
at
vale
he
ordered
the
car
stopped
at
the
and
telling
lenore
he
might
be
detained
a
few
moments
he
went
in
nash
followed
and
presently
came
back
with
a
package
of
letters
upon
taking
his
seat
in
the
car
he
assorted
the
letters
one
of
which
a
large
thick
envelope
manifestly
gave
him
excited
gratification
he
pocketed
them
and
turned
to
lenore
ah
i
see
you
get
letters
from
a
woman
she
said
pretending
a
poison
sweetness
of
jealousy
certainly
i
not
married
yet
he
replied
lenore
last
night
you
will
never
be
married
to
me
while
you
write
to
other
women
let
me
see
that
letter
let
me
read
it
all
of
them
no
lenore
not
here
and
do
speak
so
loud
your
father
will
be
coming
any
minute
lenore
he
suspects
me
and
that
cowboy
knows
things
i
ca
go
back
to
the
ranch
oh
you
must
come
no
if
you
love
me
you
got
to
run
off
with
me
but
why
the
hurry
she
appealed
it
getting
hot
for
me
what
do
you
mean
by
that
why
do
you
explain
to
me
as
long
as
you
are
so
strange
so
mysterious
how
can
i
trust
you
you
ask
me
to
run
off
with
you
yet
you
do
put
confidence
in
me
nash
grew
pale
and
earnest
and
his
hands
shook
but
if
i
do
confide
in
you
then
will
you
come
with
me
he
queried
breathlessly
i
not
promise
maybe
what
you
have
to
tell
will
prove
you
you
do
care
for
me
it
prove
i
do
he
replied
passionately
then
tell
me
lenore
realized
she
could
no
longer
play
the
part
she
had
assumed
but
nash
was
so
stirred
by
his
own
emotions
so
carried
along
in
a
current
that
he
did
not
see
the
difference
in
her
listen
i
tell
you
it
getting
hot
for
me
he
whispered
i
been
put
here
close
to
anderson
to
find
out
things
and
to
carry
out
orders
lately
i
neglected
my
job
because
i
fell
in
love
with
you
he
your
father
if
i
go
on
with
plans
and
harm
comes
to
him
i
never
get
you
is
that
clear
it
certainly
is
replied
lenore
and
she
felt
a
tightness
at
her
throat
i
no
member
of
the
he
went
on
whatever
that
organization
might
have
been
last
year
it
gone
wild
this
year
there
are
interests
that
have
used
the
i
only
an
agent
and
i
not
high
up
either
i
see
what
the
government
will
do
to
the
if
the
northwest
leaves
any
of
it
but
just
now
there
plots
against
a
few
big
men
like
your
father
he
to
be
ruined
his
crops
and
ranches
destroyed
and
he
to
be
killed
it
because
he
so
well
known
and
has
so
much
influence
that
he
was
marked
i
told
you
the
was
being
used
to
make
trouble
they
are
being
stirred
up
by
agitators
bribed
and
driven
all
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
great
disorder
in
the
northwest
germany
whispered
lenore
i
ca
say
but
men
are
all
over
and
these
men
work
in
secret
there
are
american
citizens
in
the
northwest

right
in
this
valley

have
plotted
to
ruin
your
father

i
do
not

for
germany
of
course
i

but
i
was
born

the

i
will
be

with
me
i
throw

this
dirty
job
advise
glidden
to
shift
the
plot
from
your
father
to
some
other
man
so

glidden
exclaimed
lenore
nash
bit
his
lip
and
for
the
first
time
looked
at
lenore
without
thinking
of
himself
and
surprise
dawned
in
his
eyes
yes
glidden
you
saw
him
speak
to
me
up
in
the
bend
the
first
time
your
father
went
to
see
dorn
wheat
glidden
playing
the
against
itself
he
means
to
drop
out
of
this
deal
with
big
money
i
save
your
father
if
you
stick
to
me
lenore
could
no
longer
restrain
herself
this
man
was
not
even
big
in
his
wickedness
lenore
divined
that
his
later
words
held
no
truth
ruenke
you
are
a
detestable
coward
she
said
with
quivering
scorn
i
let
you
imagine
oh
i
ca
speak
it
you
you
god
you
fooled
me
he
ejaculated
his
jaw
falling
in
utter
amaze
you
were
contemptibly
easy
you
better
jump
out
of
this
car
and
run
my
father
will
shoot
you
you
deceitful
cat
he
cried
haltingly
as
anger
overcame
his
astonishment
i
anderson
big
bulk
loomed
up
behind
nash
lenore
gasped
as
she
saw
her
father
for
his
eyes
were
upon
her
and
he
had
recognized
events
say
mister
ruenke
the
postmaster
says
you
get
letters
here
under
different
names
said
anderson
bluntly
yes
i
i
get
them
for
a
friend
stammered
the
driver
as
his
face
turned
white
you
lyin
german
pup
i
look
over
them
letters
anderson
big
hand
shot
out
to
clutch
nash
holding
him
powerless
and
with
the
other
hand
he
searched
nash
inside
coat
pockets
to
tear
forth
a
packet
of
letters
then
anderson
released
him
and
stepped
back
get
out
of
that
car
he
thundered
nash
made
a
slow
movement
as
if
to
comply
then
suddenly
he
threw
on
the
power
the
car
jerked
forward
anderson
leaped
to
get
one
hand
on
the
car
door
the
other
on
nash
he
almost
pulled
the
driver
out
of
his
seat
but
nash
held
on
desperately
and
the
car
gaining
momentum
dragged
anderson
he
could
not
get
his
feet
up
on
the
and
suddenly
he
fell
lenore
screamed
and
tore
frantically
at
the
handle
of
the
door
nash
struck
her
jerked
her
back
into
the
seat
she
struggled
until
the
car
shot
full
speed
ahead
then
it
meant
death
for
her
to
leap
out
sit
still
or
you
kill
yourself
shouted
nash
hoarsely
lenore
fell
back
almost
fainting
with
the
swift
realization
of
what
had
happened
chapter
ix
kurt
dorn
had
indeed
no
hope
of
ever
seeing
lenore
anderson
again
and
he
suffered
a
pang
that
seemed
to
leave
his
heart
numb
though
anderson
timely
visit
might
turn
out
as
providential
as
the
saving
the
wheat
waved
and
rustled
as
if
with
renewed
and
bursting
life
the
exquisite
rainbow
still
shone
a
beautiful
promise
in
the
sky
but
dorn
could
not
be
happy
in
that
moment
this
day
lenore
anderson
had
seemed
a
bewildering
fulfilment
of
the
sweetness
he
had
imagined
was
latent
in
her
she
had
meant
what
was
beyond
him
to
understand
she
had
gently
put
a
hand
to
his
lips
to
check
the
bitter
words
and
he
had
dared
to
kiss
her
soft
fingers
the
thrill
the
sweetness
the
incomprehensible
and
perhaps
imagined
response
of
her
pulse
would
never
leave
him
he
watched
the
big
car
until
it
was
out
of
sight
the
afternoon
was
only
half
advanced
and
there
were
numberless
tasks
to
do
he
decided
he
could
think
and
plan
while
he
worked
as
he
was
about
to
turn
away
he
espied
another
automobile
this
one
coming
from
the
opposite
direction
to
that
anderson
had
taken
the
sight
of
it
reminded
dorn
of
the
trick
of
throwing
phosphorus
cakes
into
the
wheat
he
was
suspicious
of
that
car
it
slowed
down
in
front
of
the
dorn
homestead
turned
into
the
yard
and
stopped
near
where
dorn
stood
the
dust
had
caked
in
layers
upon
it
someone
hailed
him
and
asked
if
this
was
the
dorn
farm
kurt
answered
in
the
affirmative
whereupon
a
tall
man
wearing
a
long
linen
coat
opened
the
car
door
to
step
out
in
the
car
remained
the
driver
and
another
man
my
name
is
hall
announced
the
stranger
with
a
pleasant
manner
from
washington
i
represent
the
government
and
am
in
the
northwest
in
the
interest
of
the
conservation
commission
your
name
has
been
recommended
to
me
as
one
of
the
progressive
young
of
the
bend
particularly
that
you
are
an
american
located
in
a
country
exceedingly
important
to
the
united
states
just
now
a
country
where
people
predominate
kurt
somewhat
startled
and
awed
managed
to
give
a
courteous
greeting
to
his
visitor
and
asked
him
into
the
house
but
hall
preferred
to
sit
outdoors
on
the
porch
he
threw
off
hat
and
coat
and
taking
an
easy
chair
he
produced
some
cigars
will
you
smoke
he
asked
offering
one
kurt
declined
with
thanks
he
was
aware
of
this
man
penetrating
yet
kindly
scrutiny
of
him
and
he
had
begun
to
wonder
this
was
no
ordinary
visitor
have
you
been
drafted
abruptly
queried
hall
yes
sir
mine
was
the
first
number
replied
kurt
with
a
little
pride
do
you
want
exemption
swiftly
came
the
second
query
it
shocked
dorn
then
stung
him
no
he
said
forcibly
your
father
sympathy
is
with
germany
i
understand
well
sir
i
do
know
how
you
understand
that
but
it
true
to
my
regret
and
shame
you
want
to
fight
went
on
the
official
i
hate
the
idea
of
war
but
i
i
guess
i
want
to
fight
maybe
because
i
feeling
scrappy
over
these
tricks
dorn
the
is
only
one
of
the
many
phases
of
war
that
we
must
meet
returned
hall
and
then
for
a
moment
he
thoughtfully
drew
upon
his
cigar
young
man
i
like
your
talk
and
i
tell
you
a
secret
my
name
not
hall
never
mind
my
name
for
you
it
uncle
sam
whereupon
with
a
winning
and
fascinating
manner
that
seemed
to
kurt
at
once
intimate
and
flattering
he
began
to
talk
fluently
of
the
meaning
of
his
visit
and
of
its
cardinal
importance
the
government
was
looking
far
ahead
preparing
for
a
tremendous
and
perhaps
a
lengthy
war
the
food
of
the
country
must
be
conserved
wheat
was
one
of
the
most
vital
things
in
the
whole
world
and
the
wheat
of
america
was
incalculably
precious
only
the
government
knew
how
precious
if
the
war
was
short
a
wheat
famine
would
come
afterward
if
it
was
long
the
famine
would
come
before
the
war
ended
but
it
was
inevitable
the
very
outcome
of
the
war
itself
depended
upon
wheat
the
government
expected
a
propaganda
by
the
german
interests
which
would
be
carried
on
secretly
and
boldly
in
every
conceivable
way
to
alienate
the
labor
organizations
to
bribe
or
menace
the
harvesters
to
despoil
crops
and
particularly
to
put
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
raising
and
harvesting
the
transporting
and
storing
of
wheat
it
would
take
an
army
to
protect
the
nation
grain
dorn
was
earnestly
besought
by
this
official
to
compass
his
district
to
find
out
who
could
be
depended
upon
by
the
united
states
and
who
was
antagonistic
to
impress
upon
the
minds
of
all
his
neighbors
the
exceeding
need
of
greater
and
more
persistent
cultivation
of
wheat
i
accept
i
do
my
best
replied
kurt
grimly
i
be
going
some
the
next
two
weeks
it
deplorable
that
most
of
the
wheat
in
this
section
is
a
failure
said
the
official
but
we
must
make
up
for
that
next
year
i
see
you
have
one
magnificent
but
fact
is
i
heard
of
that
long
before
i
got
here
yes
where
ejaculated
kurt
quick
to
catch
a
significance
in
the
other
words
i
motored
direct
from
wheatly
and
i
sorry
to
say
that
what
i
have
now
to
tell
you
is
not
pleasant
your
father
sold
this
wheat
for
eighty
thousand
dollars
in
cash
the
money
was
seen
to
be
paid
over
by
a
of
spokane
and
your
father
is
reported
to
be
suspiciously
interested
in
the
men
now
at
wheatly
oh
that
awful
exclaimed
kurt
with
a
groan
how
did
you
learn
that
from
american
farmers
men
that
i
had
been
instructed
to
approach
the
same
as
in
your
case
the
information
came
quite
by
accident
however
and
through
my
inquiring
about
the
father
has
not
been
rational
since
the
president
declared
war
very
old
i
had
trouble
with
him
he
might
do
anything
my
boy
there
are
multitudes
of
irrational
men
nowadays
and
the
number
is
growing
i
advise
you
to
go
at
once
to
wheatly
and
bring
your
father
home
it
was
openly
said
that
he
was
taking
risks
with
that
large
sum
of
money
risks
why
i
ca
understand
that
the
wheat
not
harvested
yet
let
alone
hauled
to
town
and
i
learned
the
are
working
a
trick
with
cakes
of
phosphorus
to
burn
the
wheat
kurt
produced
the
cake
of
phosphorus
and
explained
its
significance
to
the
curious
official
cunning
devils
who
but
a
german
would
ever
have
thought
of
that
he
exclaimed
german
science
to
such
ends
the
germans
put
their
supreme
knowledge
i
wonder
what
my
father
will
say
about
this
phosphorus
trick
i
just
wonder
he
loves
the
wheat
his
wheat
has
taken
prizes
at
three
fairs
maybe
to
see
our
wheat
burn
would
untwist
that
twist
in
his
brain
and
make
him
american
i
doubt
it
only
death
changes
the
state
of
a
real
german
physical
moral
and
spiritual
come
ride
back
to
glencoe
with
me
i
drop
you
there
you
can
hire
a
car
and
make
wheatly
before
dark
kurt
ran
indoors
thinking
hard
as
he
changed
clothes
he
told
the
housekeeper
to
tell
jerry
he
was
called
away
and
would
be
back
next
day
putting
money
and
a
revolver
in
his
pocket
he
started
out
but
hesitated
and
halted
he
happened
to
think
that
he
was
a
poor
shot
with
a
revolver
and
a
fine
one
with
a
rifle
so
he
went
back
for
his
rifle
a
small
repeating
gun
that
he
could
take
apart
and
hide
under
his
coat
when
he
reached
the
porch
the
official
glanced
from
the
weapon
to
kurt
face
and
said
with
a
flash
of
spirit
it
appears
that
you
are
in
earnest
i
am
something
told
me
to
take
this
responded
kurt
as
he
dismounted
the
rifle
i
already
had
one
with
an
i
know
tough
customers
when
i
see
them
these
foreigners
are
the
kind
i
do
want
near
me
and
if
i
see
one
trying
to
fire
the
wheat
i
shoot
his
leg
off
i
inclined
to
think
that
uncle
sam
would
not
deplore
your
shooting
a
little
higher
dorn
you
fine
you
all
i
heard
you
were
shake
hands
kurt
tingled
all
over
as
he
followed
the
official
out
to
the
car
and
took
the
seat
given
him
beside
the
driver
back
to
glencoe
was
the
order
and
then
even
if
conversation
had
been
in
order
it
would
scarcely
have
been
possible
that
driver
could
drive
he
had
no
fear
and
he
knew
his
car
kurt
could
drive
himself
but
he
thought
that
if
he
had
been
as
good
as
this
fellow
he
would
have
chosen
one
of
two
magnificent
services
for
the
army
an
at
the
front
or
an
aeroplane
scout
on
the
way
to
glencoe
several
squads
of
idling
and
marching
men
were
passed
all
of
whom
bore
the
earmarks
of
the
sight
of
them
made
kurt
hug
his
gun
and
wonder
at
himself
never
had
he
been
a
coward
but
neither
had
he
been
one
to
seek
a
fight
this
suave
distinguished
government
official
by
his
own
significant
metaphor
uncle
sam
gone
abroad
to
find
true
hearts
had
wrought
powerfully
upon
kurt
temper
he
sensed
events
he
revolved
in
mind
the
need
for
him
to
be
cool
and
decisive
when
facing
the
circumstances
that
were
sure
to
arise
at
glencoe
which
was
reached
so
speedily
that
kurt
could
scarcely
credit
his
eyes
the
official
said
you
hear
from
me
and
good
luck
kurt
hired
a
young
man
he
knew
to
drive
him
over
to
wheatly
all
the
way
kurt
brooded
about
his
father
strange
action
the
old
man
had
left
home
before
the
how
did
he
know
he
could
guarantee
so
many
bushels
of
wheat
as
the
indicated
kurt
divined
that
his
father
had
acted
upon
one
of
his
strange
weather
prophecies
for
he
must
have
been
absolutely
sure
of
rain
to
save
the
wheat
darkness
had
settled
down
when
kurt
reached
wheatly
and
left
the
car
at
the
railroad
station
wheatly
was
a
fairly
little
town
there
seemed
to
be
an
unusual
number
of
men
on
the
dark
streets
dim
lights
showed
here
and
there
kurt
passed
several
times
near
groups
of
conversing
men
but
he
did
not
hear
any
significant
talk
most
of
the
stores
were
open
and
well
filled
with
men
but
to
sharp
eyes
there
appeared
to
be
much
more
gossip
going
on
than
business
the
town
was
not
as
slow
and
quiet
as
was
usual
with
bend
towns
he
listened
for
war
talk
and
heard
none
two
out
of
every
three
men
who
spoke
in
his
hearing
did
not
use
the
english
language
kurt
went
into
the
office
of
the
first
hotel
he
found
there
was
no
one
present
he
glanced
at
an
old
register
lying
on
the
desk
no
guests
had
registered
for
several
days
then
kurt
went
out
and
accosted
a
man
leaning
against
a
what
going
on
in
this
town
the
man
stood
rather
indistinctly
in
the
uncertain
light
kurt
however
made
out
his
eyes
and
they
were
regarding
him
suspiciously
nothin
onusual
was
the
reply
has
harvesting
begun
in
these
parts
some
barley
cut
but
no
wheat
next
week
i
reckon
how
the
wheat
some
bad
an
some
good
is
this
town
a
headquarters
for
the
no
but
there
a
big
camp
of
near
here
reckon
you
one
of
them
union
fellers
i
am
not
declared
kurt
bluntly
reckon
you
sure
look
like
one
with
thet
gun
under
your
coat
are
you
going
to
hire
men
asked
kurt
ignoring
the
observation
i
only
a
was
the
sullen
reply
an
i
tell
you
i
join
no
kurt
spared
himself
a
moment
to
give
this
fellow
a
few
strong
proofs
of
the
fact
that
any
was
wise
to
take
such
a
stand
against
the
labor
organization
leaving
the
fellow
gaping
and
staring
after
him
kurt
crossed
the
street
to
enter
another
hotel
it
was
more
pretentious
than
the
first
with
a
large
well
lighted
office
there
were
loungers
at
the
tables
kurt
walked
to
the
desk
a
man
leaned
upon
his
elbows
he
asked
kurt
if
he
wanted
a
room
this
man
evidently
the
proprietor
was
a
german
though
he
spoke
english
i
not
sure
replied
kurt
will
you
let
me
look
at
the
register
the
man
shoved
the
book
around
kurt
did
not
find
the
name
he
sought
my
father
chris
dorn
is
in
town
can
you
tell
me
where
i
find
him
so
you
young
dorn
replied
the
other
with
instant
change
to
friendliness
i
heard
of
you
yes
the
old
man
is
here
he
made
a
big
wheat
deal
he
eating
his
supper
kurt
stepped
to
the
door
indicated
and
looking
into
the
he
at
once
espied
his
father
huge
head
with
its
shock
of
gray
hair
he
appeared
to
be
in
earnest
colloquy
with
a
man
whose
bulk
matched
his
own
kurt
hesitated
and
finally
went
back
to
the
desk
who
the
big
man
with
my
father
he
asked
he
is
a
big
man
both
ways
do
you
know
him
rejoined
the
proprietor
in
a
lower
voice
i
not
sure
answered
kurt
the
lowered
tone
had
a
significance
that
decided
kurt
to
admit
nothing
that
neuman
from
ruxton
one
of
the
biggest
wheat
men
in
washington
kurt
repressed
a
whistle
of
surprise
neuman
was
anderson
only
rival
in
the
great
fertile
valley
what
were
neuman
and
chris
dorn
doing
with
their
heads
together
i
thought
he
was
neuman
replied
kurt
feeling
his
way
is
he
in
on
the
big
deal
with
father
which
one
queried
the
proprietor
with
shrewd
eyes
taking
measure
you
in
on
both
of
course
sure
i
mean
the
wheat
sale
not
the
deal
replied
kurt
he
hazarded
a
guess
with
that
mention
of
the
no
sooner
had
the
words
passed
his
lips
than
he
divined
he
was
on
the
track
of
sinister
events
your
father
sold
out
to
that
spokane
miller
no
neuman
is
not
in
on
that
i
was
surprised
to
hear
father
had
sold
the
wheat
was
it
speculation
or
guarantee
old
chris
guaranteed
sixty
bushels
there
were
friends
of
his
here
who
advised
against
it
did
you
have
rain
over
there
fine
the
wheat
will
go
over
sixty
bushels
i
sorry
i
could
get
here
sooner
when
it
rained
you
hurried
over
to
boost
the
price
well
it
too
late
is
glidden
here
queried
kurt
hazarding
another
guess
do
talk
so
loud
warned
the
proprietor
yes
he
just
got
here
in
a
car
with
two
other
men
he
having
supper
in
his
room
supper
kurt
echoed
the
word
and
averted
his
face
to
hide
the
leap
of
his
blood
that
reminds
me
i
hungry
he
went
into
the
big
dimly
lighted
there
was
a
shelf
on
one
side
as
he
went
in
and
here
with
his
back
turned
to
the
room
he
laid
the
disjointed
gun
and
his
hat
several
newspapers
lying
near
attracted
his
eye
quickly
he
slipped
them
under
and
around
the
gun
and
then
took
a
seat
at
the
nearest
table
a
buxom
german
waitress
came
for
his
order
he
gave
it
while
he
gazed
around
at
his
old
father
and
the
burly
neuman
and
his
ears
throbbed
to
the
beat
of
his
blood
his
hand
trembled
on
the
table
his
thoughts
flashed
almost
too
swiftly
for
comprehension
it
took
a
stern
effort
to
gain
evil
of
some
nature
was
afoot
neuman
presence
there
was
a
strange
disturbing
fact
kurt
had
made
two
guesses
both
alarmingly
correct
if
he
had
any
more
illusions
or
hopes
he
dispelled
them
his
father
had
been
won
over
by
this
arch
conspirator
of
the
and
despite
his
father
where
money
was
concerned
that
eighty
thousand
dollars
or
part
of
it
was
in
danger
kurt
wondered
how
he
could
get
possession
of
it
if
he
could
he
would
return
it
to
the
bank
and
wire
a
warning
to
the
spokane
buyer
that
the
wheat
was
not
safe
he
might
persuade
his
father
to
turn
over
the
amount
of
the
debt
to
anderson
while
thinking
and
planning
kurt
kept
an
eye
on
his
father
and
rather
neglected
his
supper
presently
when
old
dorn
and
neuman
rose
and
left
the
kurt
followed
them
his
father
was
whispering
to
the
proprietor
over
the
desk
and
at
kurt
touch
he
glared
his
astonishment
you
here
what
for
he
demanded
gruffly
in
german
i
had
to
see
you
replied
kurt
in
english
did
it
rain
was
the
old
man
second
demand
husky
and
serious
the
wheat
is
made
if
we
can
harvest
it
answered
kurt
the
blaze
of
joy
on
old
dorn
face
gave
kurt
a
twinge
of
pain
he
hated
to
dispel
it
come
aside
here
a
minute
he
whispered
and
drew
his
father
over
to
a
corner
under
a
lamp
i
got
bad
news
look
at
this
he
produced
the
cake
of
phosphorus
careful
to
hide
it
from
other
curious
eyes
there
and
with
swift
low
words
he
explained
its
meaning
he
expected
an
outburst
of
surprise
and
fury
but
he
was
mistaken
i
know
about
that
whispered
his
father
hoarsely
there
wo
be
any
thrown
in
my
wheat
father
what
assurance
have
you
of
that
queried
kurt
astounded
the
old
man
nodded
his
gray
head
wisely
he
knew
but
he
did
not
speak
do
you
think
these
plotters
will
spare
your
wheat
asked
kurt
you
are
wrong
they
may
lie
to
your
face
but
they
betray
you
the
is
backed
by
by
interests
that
want
to
embarrass
the
government
what
government
why
ours
the
government
that
not
my
government
the
more
it
embarrassed
the
better
it
will
suit
me
in
the
stress
of
the
moment
kurt
had
forgotten
his
father
bitter
and
unchangeable
hatred
but
you
you
stupid
he
hissed
passionately
that
government
has
protected
you
for
fifty
years
old
dorn
growled
into
his
beard
his
huge
rolled
kurt
realized
then
finally
how
implacable
and
hopeless
he
was
how
utterly
german
then
kurt
importuned
him
to
return
the
eighty
thousand
dollars
to
the
bank
until
he
was
sure
the
wheat
was
harvested
and
hauled
to
the
railroad
my
wheat
wo
burn
was
old
dorn
stubborn
reply
well
then
give
me
anderson
thirty
thousand
i
take
it
to
him
at
once
our
debt
will
be
paid
we
have
it
off
our
minds
no
hurry
about
that
replied
his
father
but
there
is
hurry
returned
kurt
in
a
hot
whisper
anderson
came
to
see
you
he
wants
his
money
neuman
holds
the
small
end
of
that
debt
i
pay
him
anderson
can
wait
kurt
felt
no
amaze
he
expected
anything
but
he
could
scarcely
contain
his
fury
how
this
old
man
his
father
whom
he
had
loved
how
he
had
responded
to
the
influences
that
must
destroy
him
anderson
shall
not
wait
declared
kurt
i
got
some
say
in
this
matter
i
worked
like
a
dog
in
those
i
a
right
to
demand
anderson
money
he
needs
it
he
has
a
tremendous
harvest
on
his
hands
old
dorn
shook
his
huge
head
in
somber
and
gloomy
thought
his
broad
face
his
deep
eyes
seemed
to
mask
and
to
hide
it
was
an
expression
kurt
had
seldom
seen
there
but
had
always
hated
it
seemed
so
old
to
kurt
that
alien
look
something
not
born
of
his
time
anderson
is
a
capitalist
said
chris
dorn
deep
in
his
beard
he
seeks
control
of
farmers
and
wheat
in
the
northwest
ranch
after
ranch
he
gained
by
taking
up
and
foreclosing
mortgages
he
against
labor
he
grinds
down
the
poor
he
cheated
neuman
out
of
a
hundred
thousand
bushels
of
wheat
he
bought
up
my
debt
he
meant
to
ruin
me
he
you
talking
rot
whispered
kurt
shaking
with
the
effort
to
subdue
his
feelings
anderson
is
fine
big
square
a
developer
of
the
northwest
not
an
enemy
he
our
friend
oh
if
only
you
had
an
american
eyes
just
for
a
minute
father
i
want
that
money
for
anderson
my
son
i
run
my
own
business
replied
dorn
sullenly
with
a
pale
fire
in
his
opaque
eyes
you
a
wild
boy
unfaithful
to
your
blood
you
fallen
in
love
with
an
american
girl
anderson
says
he
needs
money
with
hard
gloomy
face
the
old
man
shook
his
head
he
thinks
he
harvest
again
that
strange
shake
of
finality
i
know
what
i
know
i
keep
my
money
we
have
other
rule
i
keep
my
money
kurt
had
vibrated
to
those
most
significant
words
and
he
stared
speechless
at
his
father
go
home
get
ready
for
harvest
suddenly
ordered
old
dorn
as
if
he
had
just
awakened
to
the
fact
of
kurt
disobedience
in
lingering
here
all
right
father
replied
kurt
and
turning
on
his
heel
he
strode
outdoors
when
he
got
beyond
the
light
he
turned
and
went
back
to
a
position
where
in
the
dark
he
could
watch
without
being
seen
his
father
and
the
hotel
proprietor
were
again
engaged
in
earnest
colloquy
neuman
had
disappeared
kurt
saw
the
huge
shadow
of
a
man
pass
across
a
drawn
blind
in
a
room
then
he
saw
smaller
shadows
and
arms
raised
in
vehement
gesticulation
the
very
shadows
were
sinister
men
passed
in
and
out
of
the
hotel
once
old
dorn
came
to
the
door
and
peered
all
around
kurt
observed
that
there
was
a
dark
side
entrance
to
this
hotel
presently
neuman
returned
to
the
desk
and
said
something
to
old
dorn
who
shook
his
head
emphatically
and
then
threw
himself
into
a
chair
in
a
brooding
posture
that
kurt
knew
well
he
had
seen
it
so
often
that
he
knew
it
had
to
do
with
money
his
father
was
refusing
demands
of
some
kind
neuman
again
left
the
office
this
time
with
the
proprietor
they
were
absent
some
little
time
during
this
period
kurt
leaned
against
a
tree
hidden
in
the
shadow
with
keen
eyes
watching
and
with
puzzled
anxious
mind
he
had
determined
in
case
his
father
left
that
office
with
neuman
on
one
of
those
significant
disappearances
to
slip
into
the
hotel
at
the
side
entrance
and
go
to
listen
at
the
door
of
the
room
with
the
closely
drawn
blind
neuman
returned
soon
with
the
hotel
man
and
the
two
of
them
half
led
half
dragged
old
dorn
out
into
the
street
they
took
the
direction
toward
the
railroad
kurt
followed
at
a
safe
distance
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
soon
they
passed
the
stores
with
lighted
windows
then
several
dark
houses
and
at
length
the
railroad
station
perhaps
they
were
bound
for
the
train
kurt
heard
rumbling
in
the
distance
but
they
went
beyond
the
station
across
the
track
and
turned
to
the
right
kurt
was
and
he
just
kept
the
dim
shadows
in
range
they
were
heading
for
some
that
stood
upon
a
the
dark
figures
disappeared
behind
them
then
one
figure
reappeared
coming
back
kurt
crouched
low
this
man
passed
within
a
few
yards
of
kurt
and
he
was
whispering
to
himself
after
he
was
safely
out
of
earshot
kurt
stole
on
stealthily
until
he
reached
the
end
of
the
here
he
paused
listening
he
thought
he
heard
low
voices
but
he
could
not
see
the
men
he
was
following
no
doubt
they
were
waiting
in
the
secluded
gloom
for
the
other
men
apparently
necessary
for
that
secret
conference
kurt
had
sensed
this
event
and
he
had
determined
to
be
present
he
tried
not
to
conjecture
it
was
best
for
him
to
apply
all
his
faculties
to
the
task
of
slipping
unseen
and
unheard
close
to
these
men
who
had
involved
his
father
in
some
dark
plot
not
long
after
kurt
hid
himself
on
the
other
side
of
the
he
heard
footsteps
and
subdued
voices
dark
shapes
appeared
to
come
out
of
the
gloom
they
passed
him
he
distinguished
low
guttural
voices
speaking
german
these
men
three
in
number
were
scarcely
out
of
sight
when
kurt
laid
his
rifle
on
the
projecting
shelf
of
the
and
followed
them
presently
he
came
to
deep
shadow
where
he
paused
low
voices
drew
him
on
again
then
a
light
made
him
thrill
now
and
then
the
light
appeared
to
be
darkened
by
moving
figures
a
dark
object
loomed
up
to
cut
off
kurt
view
it
was
a
pile
of
railroad
ties
and
beyond
it
loomed
another
stealing
along
these
he
soon
saw
the
light
again
quite
close
by
its
glow
he
recognized
his
father
huge
frame
back
to
him
and
the
burly
neuman
on
the
other
side
and
glidden
whose
dark
face
was
working
as
he
talked
these
three
were
sitting
evidently
on
a
flat
pile
of
ties
and
the
other
two
men
stood
behind
kurt
could
not
make
out
the
meaning
of
the
low
voices
pressing
closer
to
the
he
cautiously
and
noiselessly
advanced
glidden
was
importuning
with
expressive
hands
and
swift
low
utterance
his
face
gleamed
dark
hard
strong
intensely
strung
with
corded
quivering
muscles
with
eyes
apparently
green
orbs
of
fire
he
spoke
in
german
kurt
dared
not
go
closer
unless
he
wanted
to
be
discovered
and
not
yet
was
he
ready
for
that
he
might
hear
some
word
to
help
explain
his
father
strange
significant
intimations
about
anderson
must
have
money
glidden
was
saying
to
kurt
eyes
treachery
gleamed
in
that
working
face
neuman
bent
over
to
whisper
gruffly
in
dorn
ear
one
of
the
silent
men
standing
rubbed
his
hands
together
old
dorn
head
was
bowed
then
glidden
spoke
so
low
and
so
swiftly
that
kurt
could
not
connect
sentences
but
with
mounting
blood
he
stood
transfixed
and
horrified
to
gather
meaning
from
word
on
word
until
he
realized
anderson
doom
with
other
rich
men
of
the
northwest
was
sealed
that
there
were
to
be
burnings
of
and
of
storehouses
and
of
destruction
everywhere
i
give
money
said
old
dorn
and
with
heavy
movement
he
drew
from
inside
his
coat
a
large
package
wrapped
in
newspaper
he
laid
it
before
him
in
the
light
and
began
to
unwrap
it
soon
there
were
disclosed
two
bundles
of
bills
the
eighty
thousand
dollars
kurt
thrilled
in
all
his
being
his
poor
father
was
being
misled
and
robbed
a
melancholy
flash
of
comfort
came
to
kurt
then
at
sight
of
glidden
hungry
eyes
and
working
face
and
clutching
hands
kurt
pulled
his
hat
far
down
drew
his
revolver
and
leaped
forward
with
a
yell
hands
up
he
discharged
the
revolver
right
in
the
faces
of
the
stunned
plotters
and
snatching
up
the
bundle
of
money
he
leaped
over
the
light
knocking
one
of
the
men
down
and
was
gone
into
the
darkness
without
having
slowed
in
the
least
his
swift
action
wheeling
round
the
end
of
the
he
darted
back
risking
a
hard
fall
in
the
darkness
and
ran
along
the
several
cars
to
the
first
one
where
he
grasped
his
rifle
and
kept
on
he
heard
his
father
roar
like
that
of
a
mad
bull
and
shrill
yells
from
the
other
men
kurt
laughed
grimly
they
would
never
catch
him
in
the
dark
while
he
ran
he
stuffed
the
money
into
his
inside
coat
pockets
beyond
the
railroad
station
he
slowed
down
to
catch
his
breath
his
breast
was
heaving
his
pulse
hammering
and
his
skin
was
streaming
the
excitement
was
the
greatest
under
which
he
had
ever
labored
now
what
shall
i
do
he
panted
a
was
lumbering
toward
him
and
the
was
almost
at
the
station
the
train
appeared
to
be
going
slowly
through
without
stopping
kurt
hurried
on
down
the
track
a
little
farther
then
he
waited
he
would
get
on
that
train
and
make
his
way
somehow
to
ruxton
there
to
warn
anderson
of
the
plot
against
his
life
chapter
x
kurt
rode
to
adrian
on
that
freight
and
upon
arriving
in
the
yards
there
he
jumped
off
only
to
mount
another
headed
south
he
meant
to
be
traveling
while
it
was
dark
no
ran
at
night
and
he
wanted
to
put
as
much
distance
between
him
and
wheatly
as
possible
before
daylight
he
had
piled
into
an
open
it
was
empty
at
least
of
freight
and
the
floor
appeared
to
have
a
thin
covering
of
hay
the
train
gathering
headway
made
a
rattling
rolling
roar
kurt
hesitated
about
getting
up
and
groping
back
in
the
corners
of
the
car
he
felt
that
it
contained
a
presence
besides
his
own
and
suddenly
he
was
startled
by
an
object
blacker
than
the
shadow
that
sidled
up
close
to
him
kurt
could
not
keep
the
cold
chills
from
chasing
up
and
down
his
back
the
object
was
a
man
who
reached
for
kurt
and
felt
of
him
with
a
skinny
hand
he
whispered
hoarsely
in
kurt
ear
yes
replied
kurt
was
that
adrian
where
you
got
on
it
sure
was
answered
kurt
with
grim
humor
than
you
the
feller
sure
replied
kurt
it
was
evident
that
he
had
embarked
upon
an
adventure
when
do
we
stall
this
freight
not
while
we
on
it
you
can
gamble
other
dark
forms
sidled
out
of
the
gloomy
depths
of
that
corner
and
drew
close
to
kurt
he
realized
that
he
had
fallen
in
with
men
who
apparently
had
taken
him
for
an
expected
messenger
or
leader
he
was
importuned
for
tobacco
drink
and
money
and
he
judged
that
his
begging
companions
consisted
of
an
american
tramp
an
austrian
a
negro
and
a
german
fine
society
to
fall
into
that
eighty
thousand
dollars
became
a
tremendous
burden
how
many
men
on
this
freight
queried
kurt
thinking
he
could
ask
questions
better
than
answer
them
and
he
was
told
there
were
about
all
of
whom
expected
money
at
this
information
kurt
rather
closely
pressed
his
hand
upon
the
revolver
in
his
side
coat
pocket
by
asking
questions
and
making
judicious
replies
he
passed
what
he
felt
was
the
dark
mark
in
that
mixed
company
of
men
and
at
length
one
by
one
they
melted
away
to
their
warmer
corners
leaving
kurt
by
the
door
he
did
not
mind
the
cold
he
wanted
to
be
where
at
the
first
indication
of
a
stop
he
could
jump
off
the
train
with
his
hand
on
his
gun
and
hugging
the
bulging
coat
pockets
close
to
him
kurt
settled
himself
for
what
he
believed
would
be
interminable
hours
he
strained
eyes
and
ears
for
a
possible
attack
from
the
riffraff
men
hidden
there
in
the
car
and
that
was
why
perhaps
that
it
seemed
only
a
short
while
until
the
train
bumped
and
slowed
preparatory
to
stopping
the
instant
it
was
safe
kurt
jumped
out
and
stole
away
in
the
gloom
a
fence
obstructed
further
passage
he
peered
around
to
make
out
that
he
was
in
a
road
thereupon
he
hurried
along
it
until
he
was
out
of
hearing
of
the
train
there
was
light
in
the
east
heralding
a
dawn
that
kurt
surely
would
welcome
he
sat
down
to
wait
and
addressed
to
his
bewildered
judgment
a
query
as
to
whether
or
not
he
ought
to
keep
on
carrying
the
burdensome
rifle
it
was
not
only
heavy
but
when
daylight
came
it
might
attract
attention
and
his
bulging
coat
would
certainly
invite
curiosity
he
was
in
a
predicament
nevertheless
he
decided
to
hang
on
to
the
rifle
he
almost
fell
asleep
waiting
there
with
his
back
against
a
the
dawn
came
and
then
the
rosy
sunrise
and
he
discovered
not
half
a
mile
away
a
town
where
he
believed
he
surely
could
hire
an
automobile
waiting
grew
to
be
so
tedious
that
he
decided
to
risk
the
early
hour
and
proceeded
toward
the
town
upon
the
outskirts
he
met
a
farmer
boy
who
in
reply
to
a
question
said
that
the
town
was
connell
kurt
found
another
early
riser
in
the
person
of
a
blacksmith
who
evidently
was
a
yankee
and
proud
of
it
he
owned
a
car
that
he
was
willing
to
hire
out
on
good
security
kurt
satisfied
him
on
that
score
and
then
proceeded
to
ask
how
to
get
across
the
copper
river
and
into
golden
valley
the
highway
followed
the
railroad
from
that
town
to
kahlotus
and
there
crossed
a
big
railroad
to
turn
south
toward
the
river
in
half
an
hour
during
which
time
kurt
was
enabled
to
breakfast
the
car
was
ready
it
was
a
large
car
rather
ancient
and
the
worse
for
wear
but
its
owner
assured
kurt
that
it
would
take
him
where
he
wanted
to
go
and
he
need
not
be
afraid
to
drive
fast
with
that
inspiring
knowledge
kurt
started
off
before
ten
kurt
reached
kilo
far
across
the
copper
river
with
the
blue
mountains
in
sight
and
from
there
less
confusing
directions
to
follow
he
had
been
lucky
he
had
passed
the
wreck
of
the
upon
which
he
had
ridden
from
adrian
his
car
had
been
surrounded
by
rough
men
and
only
quick
wits
saved
him
at
least
delay
he
had
been
hailed
by
more
than
one
group
of
tramping
men
and
he
had
passed
camps
and
where
idlers
were
congregated
and
lastly
he
had
seen
far
across
the
valley
a
pall
of
smoke
from
forest
fire
he
was
going
to
reach
many
waters
in
time
to
warn
anderson
and
that
fact
gave
him
strange
exultation
when
it
was
assured
and
he
had
the
eighty
thousand
dollars
deposited
in
a
bank
he
could
feel
that
his
gray
gloomy
future
would
have
several
happy
memories
how
would
lenore
anderson
feel
toward
a
man
who
had
saved
her
father
the
thought
was
too
rich
too
sweet
for
kurt
to
dwell
upon
before
noon
kurt
began
to
climb
gradually
up
off
the
wonderfully
fertile
where
the
endless
orchards
and
boundless
gardens
delighted
his
eye
and
the
towns
grew
fewer
and
farther
between
kurt
halted
at
huntington
for
water
and
when
he
was
about
ready
to
start
a
man
rushed
out
of
a
store
glanced
hurriedly
up
and
down
the
almost
deserted
street
and
espying
kurt
ran
to
him
message
over
hell
to
pay
he
cried
excitedly
what
up
tell
me
the
message
replied
kurt
calmly
it
just
come
from
vale
anderson
the
big
rancher
he
to
send
men
out
on
all
roads
to
stop
his
car
his
daughter
in
it
she
been
made
off
with
kurt
heart
leaped
the
bursting
blood
burned
through
him
and
receded
to
leave
him
cold
tingling
anything
might
happen
to
him
this
day
he
reached
inside
the
seat
to
grasp
the
disjointed
rifle
and
three
swift
movements
seemed
to
serve
to
unwrap
it
and
put
the
pieces
together
what
else
did
anderson
say
he
asked
sharply
that
likely
the
car
would
head
for
the
hills
where
the
are
camped
what
road
from
here
leads
that
way
take
the
road
at
the
end
of
town
replied
the
man
more
calmly
ten
miles
down
you
come
to
a
fork
there
where
the
will
turn
off
to
go
up
into
the
anderson
just
you
can
head
off
his
car
if
it
on
the
hill
road
but
have
to
drive
do
you
know
anderson
car
do
you
want
men
with
you
no
time
called
kurt
as
he
leaped
into
the
seat
and
jammed
on
the
power
i
send
cars
all
over
shouted
the
man
as
kurt
whirred
away
kurt
eyes
and
hands
and
feet
hurt
with
the
sudden
intensity
of
strain
all
his
nervous
force
seemed
set
upon
the
one
great
task
of
driving
and
guiding
that
car
at
the
limit
of
its
speed
huntington
flashed
behind
two
indistinct
streaks
of
houses
an
open
road
slightly
rising
stretched
ahead
the
wind
pressed
so
hard
that
he
could
scarcely
breathe
the
car
gave
forth
a
humming
roar
kurt
heart
labored
swollen
and
tight
high
in
his
breast
and
his
thoughts
were
swift
tumultuous
an
agony
of
dread
battled
with
a
dominating
but
strange
certainty
he
felt
belief
in
his
luck
circumstances
one
by
one
had
led
to
this
drive
and
in
every
one
passed
by
he
felt
the
direction
of
chance
he
sped
by
fields
of
wheat
a
wagon
that
he
missed
by
an
inch
some
stragglers
on
the
road
and
then
far
ahead
he
saw
a
of
the
forks
as
he
neared
it
he
gradually
shut
off
the
power
to
stop
at
the
there
he
got
out
to
search
for
fresh
car
tracks
turning
up
to
the
right
there
were
none
if
anderson
car
was
coming
on
that
road
he
would
meet
it
kurt
started
again
but
at
reasonable
speed
while
his
eyes
were
sharp
on
the
road
ahead
it
was
empty
it
sloped
down
for
a
long
way
and
made
a
wide
curve
to
the
right
along
the
base
of
hilly
pastureland
and
then
again
turned
and
just
as
kurt
keen
gaze
traveled
that
far
a
big
automobile
rounded
the
bend
coming
fast
he
recognized
the
red
color
the
shape
of
the
car
anderson
he
cried
with
that
same
lift
of
his
heart
that
bursting
gush
of
blood
no
dream
i
see
it
and
i
stop
it
the
advantage
was
all
his
he
would
run
along
at
reasonable
speed
choose
a
narrow
place
stop
his
car
so
as
to
obstruct
the
road
and
get
out
with
his
rifle
it
seemed
a
long
stretch
down
that
long
slope
and
his
car
crept
along
while
the
other
gradually
closed
the
gap
slower
and
slower
kurt
ran
then
turned
half
across
the
road
and
stopped
when
he
stepped
out
the
other
car
was
two
hundred
yards
or
more
distant
kurt
saw
when
the
driver
slackened
his
speed
there
appeared
to
be
only
two
people
in
the
car
both
in
front
but
kurt
could
not
be
sure
of
that
until
it
was
only
fifty
yards
away
then
he
swung
out
his
rifle
and
waved
for
the
driver
to
stop
but
he
did
not
stop
kurt
heard
a
scream
he
saw
a
white
face
he
saw
the
driver
swing
his
hand
across
that
white
face
dashing
it
back
halt
yelled
kurt
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
but
the
driver
hunched
down
and
put
on
the
power
the
red
car
leaped
as
it
flashed
by
kurt
recognized
nash
and
anderson
daughter
she
looked
terrified
kurt
dared
not
shoot
for
fear
of
hitting
the
girl
nash
swerved
took
the
narrow
space
left
him
smashing
the
right
front
wheel
of
kurt
car
and
got
by
kurt
stepped
aside
and
took
a
quick
shot
at
the
tire
of
nash
left
hind
wheel
he
missed
his
heart
sank
and
he
was
like
ice
as
he
risked
another
the
little
bullet
struck
and
blew
the
tire
off
the
wheel
nash
car
lurched
skidded
into
the
bank
not
thirty
yards
away
with
a
bound
kurt
started
for
it
and
he
was
there
when
nash
had
twisted
out
of
his
seat
and
over
the
door
far
enough
do
move
ordered
kurt
presenting
the
rifle
nash
was
ghastly
white
with
hunted
eyes
and
open
mouth
and
his
hands
shook
oh
it
kurt
dorn
cried
a
broken
voice
kurt
saw
the
girl
fumble
with
the
door
on
her
side
open
it
and
stagger
out
of
his
sight
then
she
reappeared
round
the
car
bareheaded
disheveled
white
as
chalk
with
burning
eyes
and
bleeding
lips
she
gazed
at
kurt
as
if
to
make
sure
of
her
deliverance
miss
anderson
if
he
harmed
you
broke
out
kurt
hoarsely
oh
do
kill
him
he
has
touched
me
she
replied
wildly
but
your
lips
are
bleeding
are
they
she
put
a
trembling
hand
to
them
he
he
struck
me
that
nothing
but
you
you
have
saved
me
from
god
only
knows
what
i
have
from
him
demanded
kurt
what
is
he
he
a
german
returned
lenore
and
red
burned
out
of
the
white
of
her
cheeks
secret
agent
plotter
against
my
father
life
oh
he
knocked
father
off
the
car
dragged
him
he
ran
the
car
away
with
me
forced
me
back
he
struck
me
oh
if
i
were
a
man
nash
responded
with
a
passion
that
made
his
face
drip
with
sweat
and
distort
into
savage
fury
of
defeat
and
hate
you
cat
he
hissed
you
made
love
to
me
you
fooled
me
you
let
me
shut
up
thundered
kurt
you
german
dog
i
ca
murder
you
because
i
american
do
you
get
that
but
i
beat
you
within
an
inch
of
your
life
as
kurt
bent
over
to
lay
down
the
rifle
nash
darted
a
hand
into
the
seat
for
weapon
of
some
kind
but
kurt
in
a
rush
knocked
him
over
the
front
guard
nash
howled
he
scrambled
up
with
bloody
mouth
kurt
was
on
him
again
take
that
cried
kurt
low
and
hard
as
he
swung
his
arm
the
big
fist
that
had
grasped
so
many
took
nash
full
on
that
bloody
mouth
and
laid
him
flat
come
on
german
get
out
of
the
trench
like
a
dog
nash
thrashed
and
crawled
scraping
his
hands
in
the
dirt
to
jump
up
and
fling
a
rock
that
kurt
ducked
by
a
narrow
margin
nash
followed
it
swinging
wildly
beating
at
his
adversary
passion
long
contained
burst
in
kurt
he
tasted
the
salt
of
his
own
blood
where
he
had
bitten
his
lips
nash
showed
as
in
a
red
haze
kurt
had
to
get
his
hands
on
this
german
and
when
he
did
it
liberated
a
strange
and
terrible
joy
in
him
no
weapon
would
have
sufficed
hardly
aware
of
nash
blows
kurt
tore
at
him
swung
and
choked
him
bore
him
down
on
the
bank
and
there
beat
him
into
a
sodden
heap
only
then
did
a
cry
of
distress
seemingly
from
far
off
pierce
ears
miss
anderson
was
pulling
at
him
with
frantic
hands
oh
do
kill
him
please
do
kill
him
she
was
crying
kurt
for
my
sake
do
kill
him
that
last
poignant
appeal
brought
kurt
to
his
senses
he
let
go
of
nash
he
allowed
the
girl
to
lead
him
back
panting
hard
he
tried
to
draw
a
deep
full
breath
oh
he
does
move
whispered
lenore
with
wide
eyes
on
nash
miss
anderson
he
not
even
insensible
panted
kurt
but
licked
good
and
hard
the
girl
leaned
against
the
side
of
the
car
with
a
hand
buried
in
her
heaving
breast
she
was
recovering
the
gray
shade
left
her
face
her
eyes
still
wide
and
dark
and
beginning
to
glow
with
softer
emotions
were
upon
kurt
you
you
were
the
one
to
come
she
murmured
i
prayed
i
was
terribly
frightened
ruenke
was
taking
me
to
the
camp
up
in
the
hills
ruenke
queried
kurt
yes
that
his
german
name
kurt
awoke
to
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
searching
in
the
car
he
found
a
leather
belt
with
this
he
securely
bound
ruenke
hands
behind
his
back
then
rolled
him
down
into
the
road
my
first
german
prisoner
said
kurt
half
seriously
now
miss
anderson
we
must
be
doing
things
we
do
want
to
meet
a
lot
of
out
here
my
car
is
out
of
commission
i
hope
yours
is
not
broken
kurt
got
into
the
car
and
found
to
his
satisfaction
that
it
was
not
damaged
so
far
as
was
concerned
after
changing
the
ruined
tire
he
backed
down
the
road
and
turned
to
stop
near
where
ruenke
lay
opening
the
rear
door
kurt
picked
him
up
as
if
he
had
been
a
sack
of
wheat
and
threw
him
into
the
car
next
he
secured
the
rifle
that
had
been
such
a
burden
and
had
served
him
so
well
in
the
end
get
in
miss
anderson
he
said
and
show
me
where
to
drive
you
home
she
got
in
beside
him
making
a
grimace
as
she
saw
ruenke
lying
behind
her
kurt
started
and
ran
slowly
by
the
damaged
car
he
knocked
a
wheel
off
i
have
to
send
back
oh
i
thought
it
was
all
over
when
we
hit
said
the
girl
kurt
experienced
a
relaxation
that
was
weakening
he
could
hardly
hold
the
wheel
and
his
mood
became
one
of
exaltation
father
suspected
this
ruenke
went
on
lenore
but
he
wanted
to
find
out
things
from
him
and
i
i
undertook
to
twist
germany
round
my
finger
i
made
a
mess
of
it
he
lied
i
did
make
love
to
him
but
i
listened
to
his
and
arrogant
german
it
was
i
afraid
i
made
eyes
at
him
and
let
him
believe
i
was
smitten
oh
and
all
for
nothing
i
ashamed
but
he
lied
her
confidence
at
once
pathetic
and
humorous
and
contemptuous
augmented
kurt
homeric
mood
he
understood
that
she
would
not
even
let
him
for
a
moment
have
a
wrong
impression
of
her
it
must
have
been
hard
agreed
kurt
did
you
find
out
anything
at
all
not
much
she
replied
then
she
put
a
hand
on
his
sleeve
your
knuckles
are
all
bloody
so
they
are
i
got
that
punching
our
german
friend
oh
how
you
did
beat
him
she
cried
i
had
to
look
my
ire
was
up
too
it
was
very
womanly
of
me
that
i
gloried
in
the
sight
but
you
cried
out
you
pulled
me
away
exclaimed
kurt
that
was
because
i
was
afraid
you
kill
him
she
replied
kurt
swerved
his
glance
for
an
instant
to
her
face
it
was
at
once
flushed
and
pale
with
the
deep
blue
of
downcast
eyes
shadowy
through
her
long
lashes
exceedingly
sweet
and
beautiful
to
kurt
sight
he
bent
his
glance
again
to
the
road
ahead
miss
anderson
felt
kindly
and
gratefully
toward
him
as
was
of
course
natural
but
she
was
somehow
different
from
what
she
had
seemed
upon
the
other
occasions
he
had
seen
her
kurt
heart
was
full
to
bursting
i
might
have
killed
him
he
said
i
glad
you
stopped
me
that
that
frenzy
of
mine
seemed
to
be
the
breaking
of
a
dam
i
have
been
dammed
up
within
something
had
to
break
i
been
unhappy
for
a
long
time
i
saw
that
what
about
she
replied
the
war
and
what
it
done
to
father
we
estranged
i
hate
everything
german
i
loved
the
farm
my
chance
in
life
is
gone
the
wheat
debt
the
worry
about
the
and
that
not
all
again
she
put
a
gentle
hand
on
his
sleeve
and
left
it
there
for
a
moment
the
touch
thrilled
all
through
kurt
i
sorry
your
position
is
sad
but
maybe
it
is
not
utterly
hopeless
you
you
come
back
after
the
war
i
do
know
that
i
want
to
come
back
he
said
for
then
it
be
just
as
bad
worse
miss
anderson
it
wo
hurt
to
tell
you
the
truth
a
year
ago
that
first
time
i
saw
you
i
fell
in
love
with
you
i
think
when
i
away
over
in
france
i
like
to
feel
that
you
know
it
ca
hurt
you
and
it
be
sweet
to
me
i
fought
against
the
the
madness
but
fate
was
against
me
i
saw
you
again
and
it
was
all
over
with
me
he
paused
catching
his
breath
she
was
perfectly
quiet
he
looked
on
down
the
winding
road
there
were
in
the
distance
i
afraid
i
grew
bitter
and
moody
he
went
on
but
the
last
hours
have
changed
me
forever
i
found
that
my
poor
old
dad
had
been
won
over
by
these
unscrupulous
german
agents
of
the
but
i
saved
his
name
i
got
the
money
he
took
for
the
wheat
we
may
never
harvest
but
if
we
do
harvest
i
can
pay
all
our
debt
then
i
learned
of
a
plot
to
ruin
your
father
to
kill
him
i
was
on
my
way
to
waters
i
can
warn
him
last
of
all
i
have
saved
you
the
little
hand
dropped
away
from
his
coat
sleeve
a
soft
cry
escaped
her
it
seemed
to
him
she
was
about
to
weep
in
her
exceeding
pity
miss
anderson
i
i
rather
not
have
you
pity
me
dorn
i
certainly
do
pity
you
she
replied
with
an
unexpected
strange
tone
it
was
full
it
seemed
to
ring
in
his
ears
i
know
there
never
was
and
never
could
be
any
hope
for
me
i
i
oh
you
know
that
murmured
the
soft
strange
voice
but
kurt
could
not
trust
his
ears
and
he
had
to
make
haste
to
terminate
the
confession
into
which
his
folly
and
emotion
had
betrayed
him
he
scarcely
heard
her
words
yes
i
told
you
why
i
wanted
you
to
know
and
now
forget
that
and
when
i
gone
if
you
think
of
me
ever
let
it
be
about
how
much
better
it
made
me
to
have
all
this
good
luck
to
help
your
father
and
to
save
you
the
down
the
road
came
from
a
string
of
automobiles
flying
along
at
express
speed
kurt
saw
them
with
relief
here
come
the
cars
on
your
trail
he
called
out
your
father
will
be
in
one
of
them
kurt
opened
the
door
of
the
car
and
stepped
down
he
could
not
help
his
importance
or
his
pride
anderson
who
came
running
between
two
cars
that
had
stopped
abreast
was
coatless
and
hatless
covered
with
dust
pale
and
anderson
your
daughter
is
safe
unharmed
kurt
assured
him
my
girl
cried
the
father
huskily
and
hurried
to
where
she
leaned
out
of
her
seat
all
right
dad
she
cried
as
she
embraced
him
only
a
little
shaky
yet
it
was
affecting
for
dorn
to
see
that
meeting
and
through
it
to
share
something
of
its
meaning
anderson
thick
neck
swelled
and
colored
and
his
utterance
was
unintelligible
his
daughter
loosened
her
arm
from
round
him
and
turned
her
face
toward
kurt
then
he
imagined
he
saw
two
blue
stars
sweetly
strangely
shining
upon
him
father
it
was
our
friend
from
the
bend
she
said
he
happened
along
anderson
suddenly
changed
to
the
cool
smiling
man
kurt
remembered
howdy
kurt
he
said
and
crushed
kurt
hand
what
you
do
to
him
kurt
made
a
motion
toward
the
back
of
the
car
then
anderson
looked
over
the
seats
with
that
he
opened
the
door
and
in
one
powerful
haul
he
drew
ruenke
sliding
out
into
the
road
ruenke
bruised
and
bloody
face
was
uppermost
a
rather
gruesome
sight
anderson
glared
down
upon
him
while
men
from
the
other
cars
crowded
around
ruenke
eyes
resembled
those
of
a
cornered
rat
anderson
jaw
bulged
his
big
hands
clenched
bill
you
throw
this
fellow
in
your
car
and
land
him
in
jail
i
make
a
charge
against
him
said
the
rancher
anderson
i

some
valuable
time
interposed
kurt
got
to
return
a
car
i
broke
down
and
there

of
these
men

anderson
i
like

but
i
must

replied
kurt
please
let
me
speak
a
few
words
for
your
ear
alone
he
drew
anderson
aside
and
briefly
told
about
the
eighty
thousand
dollars
threw
back
his
coat
to
show
the
bulging
pockets
then
he
asked
anderson
advice
i
deposit

kurt
told
anderson

fortunes

life

german
intrigue
growled
the
rancher
all
in
the
same
class

shyly

said
kurt
she
gave
him
such
a
glance
as
he
had
never
received
in
his
life
kurt
felt
himself
as
wax
before
those
blue
eyes
she
wanted
to
thank
him
that
would
be
sweet
but
would
only
make
his
ordeal
harder
he
steeled
himself

she
asked
and
her
smile
was
wistful
no

home

he
replied
anderson
clambered
into
the
car
beside
his
daughter
and
laid
his
big
hands
on
the
wheel
sure
he
come
or
we
go
after
him
he
declared
heartily
so
long
son
chapter
xi
late
in
the
forenoon
of
the
next
day
kurt
dorn
reached
home
a
hot
harvest
wind
breathed
off
the
it
swelled
his
heart
to
see
the
change
in
the
color
of
that
section
of
bluestem
the
gold
had
a
tinge
of
rich
ripe
brown
kurt
father
awaited
him
a
haggard
man
unkempt
and
was
it
you
who
robbed
me
he
shouted
hoarsely
yes
replied
kurt
he
had
caught
the
eager
hope
and
fear
in
the
old
man
tone
kurt
expected
that
confession
would
bring
on
his
terrible
fury
a
mood
to
dread
but
old
dorn
showed
immense
relief
he
sat
down
in
his
relaxation
from
what
must
have
been
intense
strain
kurt
saw
a
weariness
a
shade
in
the
gray
lined
face
that
had
never
been
there
before
what
did
you
do
with
the
money
asked
the
old
man
i
banked
it
in
kilo
replied
kurt
then
i
wired
your
miller
in
spokane
so
you
safe
if
we
can
harvest
the
wheat
old
dorn
nodded
thoughtfully
there
had
come
a
subtle
change
in
him
presently
he
asked
kurt
if
men
had
been
hired
for
the
harvest
no
i
not
seen
any
i
would
trust
replied
kurt
and
then
he
briefly
outlined
anderson
plan
to
insure
a
quick
and
safe
harvesting
of
the
grain
old
dorn
objected
to
this
on
account
of
the
expense
kurt
argued
with
him
and
patiently
tried
to
show
him
the
imperative
need
of
it
dorn
apparently
was
not
to
be
won
over
however
he
was
remarkably
mild
in
comparison
with
what
kurt
had
expected
father
do
you
realize
now
that
the
men
you
were
dealing
with
at
wheatly
are
dishonest
i
mean
with
you
they
would
betray
you
old
dorn
had
no
answer
for
this
evidently
he
had
sustained
some
kind
of
shock
that
he
was
not
willing
to
admit
look
here
father
went
on
kurt
in
slow
earnestness
he
spoke
in
english
because
nothing
would
make
him
break
his
word
and
ever
again
speak
a
word
of
german
and
his
father
was
not
quick
to
comprehend
english
ca
you
see
that
the
mean
to
cripple
us
wheat
farmers
this
harvest
no
replied
old
dorn
stubbornly
but
they
do
they
do
work
if
they
accept
work
it
is
for
a
chance
to
do
damage
all
this
talk
about
more
wages
and
shorter
hours
is
deceit
they
make
a
bold
face
of
discontent
that
is
all
a
lie
the
is
out
to
ruin
the
great
and
the
great
lumber
forests
of
the
northwest
i
do
not
believe
that
declared
his
father
stoutly
what
for
kurt
meant
to
be
careful
of
that
subject
no
matter
what
for
it
does
not
make
any
difference
what
it
for
we
got
to
meet
it
to
save
our
wheat
now
wo
you
believe
me
wo
you
let
me
manage
the
harvest
i
will
not
believe
replied
old
dorn
stubbornly
not
about
wheat
i
know
they
mean
to
destroy
they
are
against
rich
men
like
anderson
but
not
me
or
my
wheat
there
is
where
you
are
wrong
i
prove
it
in
a
very
few
days
but
in
that
time
i
can
prepare
for
them
and
outwit
them
will
you
let
me
go
ahead
replied
old
dorn
gruffly
it
was
a
concession
that
kurt
was
amazed
and
delighted
to
gain
and
he
set
about
at
once
to
act
upon
it
he
changed
his
clothes
and
satisfied
his
hunger
then
saddling
his
horse
he
started
out
to
visit
his
farmer
neighbors
the
day
bade
fair
to
be
rich
in
experience
jerry
the
foreman
was
patrolling
his
long
beat
up
and
down
the
highway
jerry
carried
a
and
looked
like
a
sentry
the
men
under
him
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
section
of
wheat
and
the
ground
was
so
rolling
that
they
could
not
be
seen
from
the
highway
jerry
was
unmistakably
glad
and
relieved
to
see
kurt
some
he
declared
with
a
grin
since
you
left
there
been
one
hundred
and
sixteen
tramps
along
this
here
road
have
you
had
any
trouble
inquired
kurt
wal
i
reckon
it
was
trouble
but
every
time
i
took
a
peg
at
some
sneak
i
sort
of
broke
out
sweatin
cold
you
shot
at
them
sure
i
shot
when
i
seen
any
loafin
along
in
the
dark
two
of
them
shot
back
at
me
an
after
thet
i
was
particular
to
aim
high
reckon
i
about
dead
for
sleep
i

you
replied
kurt
jerry
does
the
wheat
look
great
wal
i
reckon
an
walkin
along
here
when
it
quiet
an
no
wind
blowin
i
can
just
hear
the
wheat
crack
it
gittin
ripe
fast
sure
the
biggest
crop
we
ever
raised
but
i
tellin
you
when
i
think
how
we
ever
harvest
it
my
insides
just
sinks
like
lead
kurt
then
outlined
anderson
plan
which
was
received
by
the
foreman
with
eager
approval
and
the
assurance
that
the
neighbor
farmers
would
rally
to
his
call
kurt
found
his
nearest
neighbor
olsen
cutting
a
thin
scarcely
ripe
barley
olsen
was
running
a
new
mccormack
harvester
and
appeared
delighted
with
the
machine
but
cast
down
by
the
grain
prospects
he
did
not
intend
to
cut
his
wheat
at
all
it
was
a
dead
loss
two
sections
twelve
hundred
an
eighty
acres
he
repeated
gloomily
an
the
third
bad
year
dorn
i
ca
pay
the
interest
to
my
bank
olsen
and
visage
was
as
hard
and
rugged
and
heroic
as
this
desert
that
had
resisted
him
for
years
kurt
saw
under
the
lines
and
the
bronze
all
the
toil
and
pain
and
unquenchable
hope
that
had
made
olsen
a
type
of
the
men
who
had
cultivated
this
desert
of
wheat
i
give
you
five
hundred
dollars
to
help
me
harvest
said
kurt
bluntly
and
briefly
stated
his
plan
olsen
whistled
he
complimented
anderson
shrewd
sense
he
spoke
glowingly
of
that
magnificent
section
of
wheat
that
absolutely
must
be
saved
he
promised
kurt
every
horse
and
every
man
on
his
farm
but
he
refused
the
five
hundred
dollars
oh
say
you
have
to
accept
it
declared
kurt
you
done
me
good
turns
asserted
olsen
but
nothing
like
this
why
this
will
be
a
rush
job
with
all
the
men
and
horses
and
machines
and
wagons
i
can
get
it
cost
ten
fifteen
thousand
dollars
to
harvest
that
section
even
at
that
and
paying
anderson
we
clear
twenty
thousand
or
more
olsen
you
got
to
take
the
money
all
right
if
you
insist
i
needin
it
bad
enough
replied
olsen
further
conversation
with
olsen
gleaned
the
facts
that
he
was
the
only
farmer
in
their
immediate
neighborhood
who
did
not
have
at
least
a
little
grain
worth
harvesting
but
the
amount
was
small
and
would
require
only
slight
time
olsen
named
farmers
that
very
likely
would
not
take
kindly
to
dorn
proposition
and
had
best
not
be
approached
the
majority
however
would
stand
by
him
irrespective
of
the
large
wage
offered
because
the
issue
was
one
to
appeal
to
the
pride
of
the
bend
farmers
olsen
appeared
surprisingly
well
informed
upon
the
tactics
of
the
and
predicted
that
they
would
cause
trouble
but
be
run
out
of
the
country
he
made
the
shrewd
observation
that
when
even
those
farmers
who
sympathized
with
germany
discovered
that
their
were
being
menaced
by
foreign
influences
and
protected
by
the
home
government
they
would
experience
a
change
of
heart
olsen
said
the
war
would
be
a
good
thing
for
the
united
states
because
they
would
win
it
and
during
the
winning
would
learn
and
suffer
and
achieve
much
kurt
rode
away
from
olsen
in
a
more
thoughtful
frame
of
mind
how
different
and
interesting
the
points
of
view
of
different
men
olsen
had
never
taken
the
time
to
become
a
naturalized
citizen
of
the
united
states
there
had
never
been
anything
to
force
him
to
do
it
but
his
understanding
of
the
worth
of
the
united
states
and
his
loyalty
to
it
were
manifest
in
his
love
for
his
wheatlands
in
fact
they
were
inseparable
probably
there
were
millions
of
pioneers
emigrants
aliens
all
over
the
country
who
were
like
olsen
who
needed
the
fire
of
the
crucible
to
mold
them
into
a
unity
with
americans
of
such
americans
were
molded
kurt
rode
all
day
and
when
late
that
night
he
got
home
weary
and
sore
and
choked
he
had
enlisted
the
services
of
farmers
to
help
him
harvest
the
now
famous
section
of
wheat
his
father
had
plainly
doubted
the
willingness
of
these
neighbors
to
abandon
their
own
labors
for
the
bend
exacted
toil
for
every
hour
of
every
season
whether
rich
or
poor
in
yield
likewise
he
was
plainly
moved
by
the
facts
his
seamed
and
shaded
face
of
gloom
had
a
moment
of
light
they
will
make
short
work
of
this
harvest
he
said
thoughtfully
i
should
say
so
retorted
kurt
we
harvest
and
haul
that
grain
to
the
railroad
in
just
three
days
impossible
ejaculated
dorn
you
see
declared
kurt
you
see
who
managing
this
harvest
he
could
not
restrain
his
little
outburst
of
pride
for
the
moment
the
great
overhanging
sense
of
calamity
that
for
long
had
haunted
him
faded
into
the
background
it
did
seem
sure
that
they
would
save
this
splendid
yield
of
wheat
how
much
that
meant
to
kurt
in
freedom
from
debt
in
natural
love
of
the
fruition
of
harvest
in
the
loyalty
to
his
government
he
realized
how
strange
and
strong
was
the
need
in
him
to
prove
he
was
american
to
the
very
core
of
his
heart
he
did
not
yet
understand
that
incentive
but
he
felt
it
after
eating
dinner
kurt
took
his
rifle
and
went
out
to
relieve
jerry
only
a
few
more
days
and
nights
he
exclaimed
to
his
foreman
then
we
have
all
the
harvesters
in
the
country
right
in
our
wheat
wal
a
hell
of
a
lot
can
happen
before
then
declared
jerry
pessimistically
kurt
was
brought
back
to
realities
rather
suddenly
but
questioning
jerry
did
not
elicit
any
new
or
immediate
cause
for
worry
jerry
appeared
tired
out
you
go
get
some
sleep
said
kurt
all
right
bill
been
dividin
this
night
watch
with
me
i
reckon
he
be
out
when
he
wakes
up
replied
jerry
and
trudged
away
kurt
shouldered
his
rifle
and
slowly
walked
along
the
road
with
a
strange
sense
that
he
was
already
doing
army
duty
in
protecting
property
which
was
at
once
his
own
and
his
country
the
night
was
dark
cool
and
quiet
the
heavens
were
starry
bright
a
faint
breeze
brought
the
tiny
crackling
of
the
wheat
from
far
distant
came
the
bay
of
a
hound
the
road
stretched
away
pale
and
yellow
into
the
gloom
in
the
silence
and
loneliness
and
darkness
in
all
around
him
and
far
across
the
dry
whispering
fields
there
was
an
invisible
presence
that
had
its
affinity
in
him
hovered
over
him
shadowless
and
immense
and
waved
in
the
bursting
wheat
it
was
life
he
felt
the
wheat
ripening
he
felt
it
in
reawakened
tenderness
for
his
old
father
and
in
the
stir
of
memory
of
lenore
anderson
the
past
active
and
important
hours
had
left
little
room
for
thought
of
her
but
now
she
came
back
to
him
a
spirit
in
keeping
with
his
steps
a
shadow
under
the
stars
a
picture
of
sweet
wonderful
young
womanhood
his
whole
relation
of
thought
toward
her
had
undergone
some
marvelous
change
the
most
divine
of
gifts
had
been
granted
him
an
opportunity
to
save
her
from
harm
perhaps
from
death
he
had
served
her
father
how
greatly
he
could
not
tell
but
if
measured
by
the
gratitude
in
her
eyes
it
would
have
been
infinite
he
recalled
that
expression
blue
warm
soft
and
indescribably
strange
with
its
unuttered
hidden
meaning
it
was
for
him
to
realize
that
she
had
been
compelled
to
give
him
a
separate
and
distinct
place
in
her
mind
he
must
stand
apart
from
all
others
she
knew
it
had
been
his
fortune
to
preserve
her
happiness
and
the
happiness
that
she
must
be
to
sisters
and
mother
and
that
some
day
she
would
bestow
upon
some
lucky
man
they
would
all
owe
it
to
him
and
lenore
anderson
knew
he
loved
her
these
things
had
transformed
his
relation
of
thought
toward
her
he
had
no
regret
no
jealousy
no
fear
even
the
pang
of
suppressed
and
overwhelming
love
had
gone
with
his
confession
but
he
did
remember
her
presence
her
beauty
her
intent
blue
glance
and
the
faint
dreaming
smile
of
her
lips
remembered
them
with
a
thrill
and
a
wave
of
emotion
and
a
contraction
of
his
heart
he
had
promised
to
see
her
once
more
to
afford
her
the
opportunity
no
doubt
to
thank
him
to
try
to
make
him
see
her
gratitude
he
would
go
but
he
wished
it
need
not
be
he
asked
no
more
and
seeing
her
again
might
change
his
fulness
of
joy
to
something
of
pain
so
kurt
trod
the
long
road
in
the
darkness
and
silence
pausing
and
checking
his
dreams
now
and
then
to
listen
and
to
watch
he
heard
no
suspicious
sounds
nor
did
he
meet
any
one
the
night
was
melancholy
with
a
hint
of
fall
in
its
cool
breath
soon
he
would
be
walking
a
beat
in
one
of
the
with
a
in
his
ears
and
the
turmoil
of
thousands
of
soldiers
in
the
making
around
him
soon
too
he
would
be
walking
the
deck
of
a
transport
looking
back
down
the
wake
of
the
ship
toward
home
listening
to
the
mysterious
moan
of
the
ocean
and
then
soon
feeling
under
his
feet
the
soil
of
a
foreign
country
with
hideous
and
incomparable
war
shrieking
its
shell
furies
and
its
man
anguish
all
about
him
but
no
matter
how
far
away
he
ever
got
he
knew
lenore
anderson
would
be
with
him
as
she
was
there
on
that
dim
lonely
starlit
country
road
and
in
these
long
hours
of
his
vigil
kurt
dorn
divined
a
relation
between
his
love
for
lenore
anderson
and
a
terrible
need
that
had
grown
upon
him
a
need
of
his
heart
and
his
soul
more
than
he
needed
her
if
even
in
his
wildest
dreams
he
had
permitted
himself
visions
of
an
earthly
paradise
he
needed
to
prove
to
his
blood
and
his
spirit
that
he
was
actually
and
truly
american
he
had
no
doubt
of
his
intelligence
his
reason
his
choice
the
secret
lay
hidden
in
the
depths
of
him
and
he
knew
it
came
from
the
springs
of
the
mother
who
had
begotten
him
his
mother
had
given
him
birth
and
by
every
tie
he
was
mostly
hers
kurt
had
been
in
college
during
the
first
year
of
the
world
war
and
his
name
his
fair
hair
and
complexion
his
fluency
in
german
and
his
remarkable
efficiency
in
handicrafts
had
opened
him
to
many
a
hint
many
a
veiled
sarcasm
that
had
stung
him
like
a
poison
brand
there
was
injustice
in
all
this
war
spirit
it
changed
the
minds
of
men
and
women
he
had
not
doubted
himself
until
those
terrible
scenes
with
his
father
and
though
he
had
reacted
to
them
as
an
american
he
had
felt
the
drawing
burning
blood
tie
he
hated
everything
german
and
he
knew
he
was
wrong
in
doing
so
he
had
clear
conception
in
his
mind
of
the
difference
between
the
german
war
motives
and
means
and
those
of
the
other
nations
kurt
problem
was
to
understand
himself
his
great
fight
was
with
his
own
soul
his
material
difficulties
and
his
despairing
love
had
suddenly
been
transformed
so
that
they
had
lent
his
spirit
wings
how
many
poor
boys
and
girls
in
america
must
be
helplessly
divided
between
parents
and
country
how
many
faithful
and
blind
parents
obedient
to
the
laws
of
mind
and
heart
set
for
all
time
must
see
a
favorite
son
go
out
to
fight
against
all
they
had
held
sacred
that
was
all
bad
enough
but
kurt
had
more
to
contend
with
no
illusions
had
he
of
a
chastened
german
spirit
a
clarified
german
mind
an
unbrutalized
german
heart
kurt
knew
his
father
what
would
change
his
father
nothing
but
death
death
for
himself
or
death
for
his
only
son
kurt
had
an
incalculable
call
to
prove
forever
to
himself
that
he
was
free
he
had
to
spill
his
own
blood
to
prove
himself
or
he
had
to
spill
that
of
an
enemy
and
he
preferred
that
it
should
be
his
own
but
that
did
not
change
a
vivid
and
terrible
picture
which
haunted
him
at
times
he
saw
a
dark
wide
and
barren
shingle
of
the
world
a
desert
of
desolation
made
by
man
where
strange
windy
shrieks
and
thundering
booms
and
awful
cries
went
up
in
the
night
and
where
drifting
palls
of
smoke
made
starless
sky
and
bursts
of
reddish
fires
made
hell
suddenly
kurt
slow
pacing
along
the
road
was
halted
as
was
the
trend
of
his
thought
he
was
not
sure
he
had
heard
a
sound
but
he
quivered
all
over
the
night
was
far
advanced
now
the
wind
was
almost
still
the
wheat
was
smooth
and
dark
as
the
bosom
of
a
resting
sea
kurt
listened
he
imagined
he
heard
far
away
the
faint
roar
of
an
automobile
but
it
might
have
been
a
train
on
the
railroad
sometimes
on
still
nights
he
caught
sounds
like
that
then
a
swish
in
the
wheat
a
soft
thud
very
low
unmistakably
came
to
kurt
ear
he
listened
turning
his
ear
to
the
wind
presently
he
heard
it
again
a
sound
relating
both
to
wheat
and
earth
in
a
hot
flash
he
divined
that
some
one
had
thrown
fairly
heavy
bodies
into
the
phosphorus
cakes
kurt
held
his
breath
while
he
peered
down
the
gloomy
road
his
heart
pounding
his
hands
gripping
the
rifle
and
when
he
descried
a
dim
form
stealthily
coming
toward
him
he
yelled
halt
instantly
the
form
wavered
moved
swiftly
with
quick
pad
of
footfalls
kurt
shot
once
twice
three
times
and
aimed
as
best
he
could
to
hit
the
form
either
fell
or
went
on
out
of
sight
in
the
gloom
kurt
answered
the
excited
shouts
of
his
men
calling
them
to
come
across
to
him
then
he
went
cautiously
down
the
road
peering
on
the
ground
for
a
dark
form
but
he
failed
to
find
it
and
presently
had
to
admit
that
in
the
dark
his
aim
had
been
poor
bill
came
out
to
relieve
kurt
and
together
they
went
up
and
down
the
road
for
a
mile
without
any
glimpse
of
a
skulking
form
it
was
almost
daylight
when
kurt
went
home
to
get
a
few
sleep
chapter
xii
next
day
was
one
of
the
rare
days
with
a
furnace
wind
that
roared
over
the
the
sky
was
steely
and
the
sun
like
copper
it
was
a
day
which
would
bring
the
wheat
to
a
head
at
breakfast
jerry
reported
that
fresh
auto
tracks
had
been
made
on
the
road
during
the
night
and
that
dust
and
wheat
all
around
the
great
field
showed
a
fresh
tramping
kurt
believed
a
deliberate
and
particular
attempt
had
been
made
to
insure
the
destruction
of
the
dorn
and
he
ordered
all
hands
out
to
search
for
the
dangerous
little
cakes
of
phosphorus
it
was
difficult
to
find
them
the
wheat
was
almost
as
high
as
a
head
and
very
thick
to
force
a
way
through
it
without
tramping
it
down
took
care
and
time
besides
the
soil
was
soft
and
the
agents
who
had
perpetrated
this
vile
scheme
had
perfectly
matched
the
color
kurt
almost
stepped
on
one
of
the
cakes
before
he
saw
it
his
men
were
very
slow
in
finding
any
but
kurt
father
seemed
to
walk
fatally
right
to
them
for
in
a
short
hundred
yards
he
found
three
they
caused
a
profound
change
in
this
gloomy
man
not
a
word
did
he
utter
but
he
became
animated
by
a
tremendous
energy
the
search
was
discouraging
it
was
like
hunting
for
dynamite
bombs
that
might
explode
at
any
moment
all
kurt
dread
of
calamity
returned
fourfold
the
intense
heat
of
the
day
that
would
ripen
the
wheat
to
bursting
would
likewise
sooner
or
later
ignite
the
cakes
of
phosphorus
and
when
jerry
found
a
cake
far
inside
the
field
away
from
the
road
showing
that
powerful
had
been
the
arm
that
had
thrown
it
there
and
how
impossible
it
would
be
to
make
a
thorough
search
kurt
almost
succumbed
to
discouragement
still
he
kept
up
a
frenzied
hunting
and
inspired
the
laborers
to
do
likewise
about
ten
an
excited
shout
from
bill
drew
kurt
attention
and
he
ran
along
the
edge
of
the
field
bill
was
sweaty
and
black
yet
through
it
all
kurt
believed
he
saw
the
man
was
pale
he
pointed
with
shaking
hand
toward
olsen
hill
kurt
vibrated
to
a
shock
he
saw
a
long
circular
yellow
column
rising
from
the
hill
slanting
away
on
the
strong
wind
dust
he
cried
aghast
smoke
replied
bill
hoarsely
the
catastrophe
had
fallen
olsen
wheat
was
burning
kurt
experienced
a
profound
sensation
of
sadness
what
a
pity
the
burning
of
wheat
the
destruction
of
bread
when
part
of
the
world
was
starving
tears
dimmed
his
eyes
as
he
watched
the
swelling
column
of
smoke
bill
was
cursing
and
kurt
gathered
that
the
was
predicting
fires
all
around
this
was
inevitable
but
it
meant
no
great
loss
for
most
of
the
whose
yield
had
failed
for
kurt
and
his
father
if
fire
got
a
hold
in
their
wheat
it
meant
ruin
kurt
sadness
was
burned
out
by
a
slow
and
growing
rage
bill
go
hitch
up
to
the
big
mower
ordered
kurt
we
have
to
cut
all
around
our
field
bring
drinking
water
and
whatever
you
can
lay
a
hand
on
anything
to
fight
fire
bill
ran
thumping
away
over
the
clods
then
it
happened
that
kurt
looked
toward
his
father
the
old
man
was
standing
with
his
arms
aloft
his
face
turned
toward
the
burning
wheat
and
he
made
a
tragic
figure
that
wrung
kurt
heart
jerry
came
running
up
fire
fire
olsen
burnin
look
by
all
dirty
them
hev
done
it
kurt

jerry

replied
kurt

men
and
father

keep
on
searching
for
phosphorus
cakes
jerry

to
the
high
ground
watch

starting
on
our
land
if
you
see
one

for

and
make

it
wheat

slow
till
it
gets
started
we
can
put
out
fires
if
we
quick

jerry
pale
with
anger
his
big
red
hands
worked
if

we
got
to
hev
a
lot
of
men
by
gawd
if
i
ai

jerry
said
kurt
fiercely
you
never
can
tell
it
looks
hopeless
but
we
never
give
up
hustle
now
jerry
shuffled
off
as
old
dorn
came
haltingly
as
if
stunned
toward
kurt
but
kurt
did
not
want
to
face
his
father
at
that
moment
he
needed
to
fight
to
keep
up
his
own
courage
never
mind
that
yelled
kurt
pointing
at
olsen
hill
keep
looking
for
those
damned
pieces
of
phosphorus
with
that
kurt
dove
into
the
wheat
and
sweeping
wide
his
arms
to
make
a
passage
he
strode
on
his
eyes
bent
piercingly
upon
the
ground
close
about
him
he
did
not
penetrate
deeper
into
the
wheat
from
the
road
than
the
distance
he
estimated
a
strong
arm
could
send
a
stone
almost
at
once
his
keen
sight
was
rewarded
he
found
a
cake
of
phosphorus
half
buried
in
the
soil
it
was
dry
hard
and
hot
either
from
the
sun
or
its
own
generating
power
that
inspired
kurt
he
hurried
on
long
practice
enabled
him
to
slip
through
the
wheat
as
a
barefoot
country
boy
could
run
through
the
and
his
passion
gave
him
the
eyes
of
a
hunting
hawk
sweeping
down
over
the
grass
to
and
fro
he
passed
within
the
limits
he
had
marked
oblivious
to
time
and
heat
and
effort
and
covering
that
part
of
the
bordering
the
road
he
collected
cakes
of
phosphorus
the
last
few
of
which
were
so
hot
they
burnt
his
hands
then
he
had
to
rest
he
appeared
as
wet
as
if
he
had
been
plunged
into
water
his
skin
burned
his
eyes
pained
his
breast
heaved
panting
and
spent
he
lay
along
the
edge
of
the
wheat
with
closed
eyelids
and
lax
muscles
when
he
recovered
he
rose
and
went
back
along
the
road
the
last
quarter
of
the
immense
lay
upon
a
slope
of
a
hill
and
kurt
had
to
mount
this
before
he
could
see
the
valley
from
the
summit
he
saw
a
sight
that
caused
him
to
utter
a
loud
exclamation
many
columns
of
smoke
were
lifting
from
the
valley
and
before
him
the
sky
was
darkened
olsen
hill
was
as
if
under
a
cloud
no
flames
showed
anywhere
but
in
places
the
line
of
smoke
appeared
to
be
approaching
it
a
thousand
to
one
against
us
he
said
bitterly
and
looked
at
his
watch
he
was
amazed
to
see
that
three
hours
had
passed
since
he
had
given
orders
to
the
men
he
hurried
back
to
the
house
no
one
was
there
except
the
old
servant
who
was
wringing
her
hands
and
crying
that
the
house
would
burn
throwing
the
cakes
of
phosphorus
into
a
kurt
ran
into
the
kitchen
snatched
a
few
biscuits
and
then
made
for
the
fields
eating
as
he
went
he
hurried
down
a
lane
that
bordered
the
big
on
this
side
was
fallow
ground
for
half
the
length
of
the
section
and
the
other
half
was
ripe
barley
dry
as
tinder
and
beyond
that
in
line
with
the
burning
fields
a
of
blasted
wheat
the
men
were
there
kurt
saw
at
once
that
other
men
with
horses
and
machines
were
also
there
then
he
recognized
olsen
and
two
other
of
his
neighbors
as
he
ran
up
he
was
equally
astounded
and
out
of
breath
so
that
he
could
not
speak
old
dorn
sat
with
gray
head
bowed
on
his
hand
hello
shouted
olsen
his
grimy
face
broke
into
a
hard
smile
fires
all
over
wheat
burnin
like
prairie
grass
them
chips
of
phosphorus
are
sure
from
hell
we
come
over
to
help
you
did

left
your
fields
gasped
kurt
sure
they

much
to
leave
and
we
goin
to
save
this
section
of
yours
or
bust
tryin
i
sent
my
son
in
his
car
all
over
to
hurry
men
here
with
horses
machines
wagons
kurt
was
overcome
he
could
only
wring
olsen
hand
here
was
an
answer
to
one
of
his
brooding
gloomy
queries
something
would
be
gained
even
if
the
wheat
was
lost
kurt
had
scarcely
any
hope
left
what
to
be
done
he
panted
hoarsely
in
this
extremity
olsen
seemed
a
tower
of
strength
this
sturdy
farmer
was
of
anderson
breed
even
if
he
was
a
foreigner
and
he
had
fought
fires
before
if
we
have
time
we
mow
a
line
all
around
your
wheat
replied
olsen
reckon
we
wo
have
time
interposed
jerry
pointing
to
a
smoke
far
down
in
the
corner
of
the
stunted
wheat
there
a
fire
startin
they
break
out
all
over
said
olsen
and
he
waved
a
couple
of
his
men
away
one
had
a
scythe
and
the
other
a
long
pole
with
a
wet
burlap
bag
tied
on
one
end
they
hurried
toward
the
little
cloud
of
smoke
i
found
a
lot
of
cakes
over
along
the
road
declared
kurt
with
a
grim
surety
that
he
had
done
that
well
they
surrounded
your
wheat
returned
olsen
but
if
enough
men
get
here
we
save
the
whole
section
lucky
you
got
two
wells
that
watertank
we
need
all
the
water
we
can
get
keep
a
man
pumpin
fetch
all
the
bags
an
brooms
an
scythes
i
post
lookouts
along
this
lane
to
watch
for
fires
breakin
out
in
the
big
field
when
they
do
we
got
to
run
an
cut
an
beat
them
out
it
wo
be
long
till
most
of
this
section
is
surrounded
by
fire
thin
clouds
of
smoke
were
then
blowing
across
the
fields
and
the
wind
that
carried
them
was
laden
with
an
odor
of
burning
wheat
to
kurt
it
seemed
to
be
the
fragrance
of
baking
bread
how
it
be
to
begin
harvestin
queried
jerry
thet
wheat
ripe
no
combines
should
be
risked
in
there
until
we
sure
the
past
replied
olsen
there
i
see
more
of
our
neighbors
comin
down
the
road
we
goin
to
beat
the
that
galvanized
kurt
into
action
and
he
found
himself
dragging
jerry
back
to
the
barns
they
hitched
a
team
to
a
heavy
wagon
in
record
time
and
then
began
to
load
with
whatever
was
available
for
fighting
fire
they
loaded
a
barrel
and
with
huge
buckets
filled
it
with
water
leaving
jerry
to
drive
kurt
rushed
back
to
the
fields
during
his
short
absence
more
men
with
horses
and
machines
had
arrived
fire
had
broken
out
in
the
stunted
wheat
and
also
nearer
at
hand
in
the
barley
kurt
saw
his
father
laboring
like
a
giant
olsen
was
taking
charge
directing
the
men
the
sky
was
obscured
now
and
all
the
west
was
thick
with
yellow
smoke
the
south
slopes
and
valley
floor
were
clouding
only
in
the
east
over
the
hill
did
the
air
appear
clear
back
of
kurt
down
across
the
barley
and
wheat
on
the
dorn
land
a
line
of
fire
was
creeping
over
the
hill
this
was
on
the
property
adjoining
olsen
gremniger
the
owner
had
abandoned
his
own
fields
at
the
moment
he
was
driving
a
mower
along
the
edge
of
the
barley
cutting
a
path
men
behind
him
were
stacking
the
sheaves
the
wind
was
as
hot
as
if
from
a
the
air
was
thick
and
oppressive
the
light
of
day
was
growing
dim
kurt
mounted
on
the
seat
of
one
of
the
combine
threshers
surveyed
with
rapid
and
anxious
gaze
all
the
points
around
him
and
it
lingered
over
the
magnificent
sweep
of
golden
wheat
the
wheat
bowed
in
waves
before
the
wind
and
the
silken
rustle
heard
above
the
confusion
of
yelling
men
was
like
a
voice
whispering
to
kurt
somehow
his
dread
lessened
then
and
other
emotions
predominated
he
saw
more
and
more
farmers
arrive
in
cars
in
wagons
with
engines
and
threshers
until
the
lane
was
lined
with
them
and
men
were
hurrying
everywhere
suddenly
kurt
espied
a
slender
column
of
smoke
rising
above
the
wheat
out
in
front
of
him
toward
the
highway
this
was
the
first
sign
of
fire
in
the
great
section
that
so
many
farmers
had
come
to
protect
yelling
for
help
he
leaped
off
the
seat
and
ran
with
all
his
might
toward
the
spot
breasting
that
thick
wheat
was
almost
as
hard
as
breasting
waves
jerry
came
yelling
after
him
brandishing
a
crude
beater
and
both
of
them
reached
the
fire
at
once
it
was
a
small
circle
burning
slowly
madly
kurt
rushed
in
to
tear
and
stamp
as
if
the
little
hissing
flames
were
serpents
he
burned
his
hands
through
his
gloves
and
his
feet
through
his
boots
jerry
beat
hard
accompanying
his
blows
with
profane
speech
plainly
indicating
that
he
felt
he
was
at
work
on
the
in
short
order
they
put
out
this
little
fire
returning
to
his
post
kurt
watched
until
he
was
called
to
lend
a
hand
down
in
the
stunted
wheat
fire
had
crossed
and
had
gotten
a
hold
on
dorn
lower
field
here
the
wheat
was
blasted
and
so
burned
all
the
more
fiercely
horses
and
mowers
had
to
be
taken
away
to
the
intervening
a
weird
smoky
and
ruddy
darkness
enveloped
the
scene
dim
red
fire
in
lines
and
dots
and
curves
appeared
on
three
sides
growing
larger
and
longer
meeting
in
some
places
crisscrossed
by
black
figures
of
threshing
men
belaboring
the
flames
kurt
came
across
his
father
working
like
a
kurt
warned
him
not
to
overexert
himself
and
the
father
never
heard
now
and
then
his
stentorian
yell
added
to
the
medley
of
cries
and
shouts
and
blows
and
the
roar
of
the
wind
fanning
the
flames
kurt
was
put
to
beating
fire
in
the
cut
wheat
he
stood
with
flames
licking
at
his
boots
it
was
astonishing
how
tenacious
the
fire
appeared
how
it
crept
along
eating
up
the
mowed
wheat
all
the
men
that
could
be
spared
there
were
unable
to
check
it
and
keep
it
out
of
the
standing
grain
when
it
reached
this
line
it
lifted
a
blaze
flamed
and
roared
and
burned
like
wildfire
in
grass
the
men
were
driven
back
threshing
and
beating
all
to
no
avail
kurt
fell
into
despair
there
was
no
hope
it
seemed
like
an
inferno
flaring
high
the
light
showed
the
black
violently
agitated
forms
of
the
fighters
and
the
clouds
of
yellow
smoke
coalescing
and
drifting
changing
to
dark
and
soaring
high
olsen
had
sent
three
mowers
abreast
down
the
whole
length
of
the
before
the
fire
reached
that
line
it
was
a
wise
move
and
if
anything
could
do
so
it
would
save
the
day
the
leaping
flame
thin
and
high
and
a
mile
long
curled
down
the
last
of
the
standing
wheat
and
caught
the
fallen
barley
but
here
its
speed
was
checked
it
had
to
lick
a
way
along
the
ground
in
desperation
in
unabated
fury
the
little
army
of
farmers
and
laborers
with
no
thought
of
personal
gain
with
what
seemed
to
kurt
a
wonderful
and
noble
spirit
attacked
this
encroaching
line
of
fire
like
men
whose
homes
and
lives
and
ideals
had
been
threatened
with
destruction
kurt
mind
worked
as
swiftly
as
his
tireless
hands
this
indeed
was
being
in
a
front
line
of
battle
the
scene
was
weird
dark
fitful
at
times
impressive
and
again
unreal
these
neighbors
of
his
many
of
them
aliens
some
of
them
germans
when
put
to
this
vital
test
were
proving
themselves
they
had
shown
little
liking
for
the
dorns
but
here
was
love
of
wheat
and
so
in
some
way
loyalty
to
the
government
that
needed
it
here
was
the
answer
of
the
northwest
to
the
no
doubt
if
the
perpetrators
of
that
phosphorus
trick
could
have
been
laid
hold
of
then
blood
would
have
been
shed
kurt
sensed
in
the
fierce
energy
in
the
dark
grimy
faces
shining
and
wet
under
the
light
in
the
hoarse
yell
and
answering
shout
a
nameless
force
that
was
finding
itself
and
centering
on
one
common
cause
his
old
father
toiled
as
ten
men
that
burly
giant
pushed
ever
in
the
lead
and
his
hoarse
call
and
strenuous
action
told
of
more
than
a
mercenary
rage
to
save
his
wheat
fire
never
got
across
that
swath
of
cut
barley
it
was
beaten
out
as
if
by
a
thousand
men
shadow
and
gloom
enveloped
the
fighters
as
they
rested
where
their
last
strokes
had
fallen
over
the
hills
faint
reflection
of
dying
flames
lit
up
the
dark
clouds
of
smoke
the
battle
seemed
won
then
came
the
thrilling
cry
fire
fire
one
of
the
outposts
came
running
out
of
the
dark
fire
the
other
side
fire
rang
out
olsen
yell
kurt
ran
with
the
gang
through
the
dark
up
the
barley
slope
to
see
a
long
red
line
a
high
red
flare
and
lifting
clouds
of
ruddy
smoke
fire
in
the
big
the
sight
inflamed
him
carried
him
beyond
his
powers
and
all
he
knew
was
that
he
became
the
center
of
a
dark
and
whirling
mêlée
encircled
by
living
flames
that
leaped
only
to
be
beaten
down
whether
that
threshing
chaos
of
fire
and
smoke
and
wheat
was
short
or
long
was
beyond
him
to
tell
but
the
fire
was
extinguished
to
the
last
spark
walking
back
with
the
weary
crowd
kurt
felt
a
clearer
breeze
upon
his
face
smoke
was
not
flying
so
thickly
over
the
western
hill
through
a
rift
in
the
clouds
peeped
a
star
the
only
other
light
he
saw
twinkled
far
down
the
lane
it
was
that
of
a
lantern
dark
forms
barred
it
now
and
then
slowly
kurt
recovered
his
breath
the
men
were
talking
and
tired
voices
rang
with
assurance
that
the
fire
was
beaten
some
one
called
kurt
the
voice
was
jerry
it
seemed
hoarse
and
strained
kurt
could
see
the
lean
form
of
his
man
standing
in
the
light
of
the
lantern
a
small
dark
group
of
men
silent
and
somehow
impressive
stood
off
a
little
in
the
shadow
here
i
am
jerry
called
kurt
stepping
forward
just
then
olsen
joined
jerry
boy
we
beat
the
but
but
he
began
and
broke
off
huskily
what
the
matter
queried
kurt
and
a
cold
chill
shot
over
him
jerry
plucked
at
his
sleeve
your
old
man
your
dad
he
overworked
hisself
whispered
jerry
it
tough
nobody
could
stop
him
kurt
felt
that
the
fulfilment
of
his
icy
sickening
dread
had
come
jerry
dark
face
even
in
the
uncertain
light
was
tragic
boy
his
heart
went
back
on
him
he
dead
said
olsen
solemnly
kurt
pushed
the
kind
hands
aside
a
few
steps
brought
him
to
where
under
the
light
of
the
lantern
lay
his
father
pale
and
still
with
a
strange
softening
of
the
iron
cast
of
intolerance
dead
whispered
kurt
in
awe
and
horror
father
oh
gone
without
a
word
again
jerry
plucked
at
kurt
sleeve
i
was
with
him
said
jerry
i
heard
him
fall
an
groan
i
had
the
light
i
bent
over
lifted
his
head
an
he
said
speaking
english
my
son
i
was
wrong
then
he
died
an
thet
was
all
kurt
staggered
away
from
the
whispering
sympathetic
foreman
out
into
the
darkness
where
he
lifted
his
face
in
the
thankfulness
of
a
breaking
heart
it
had
indeed
taken
the
approach
of
death
to
change
his
hard
old
father
oh
he
meant
that
if
he
had
his
life
to
live
over
again
he
would
be
different
whispered
kurt
that
was
the
one
great
word
needed
to
reconcile
kurt
to
his
father
the
night
had
grown
still
except
for
the
murmuring
of
the
men
smoke
veiled
the
horizon
kurt
felt
an
intense
and
terrible
loneliness
he
was
indeed
alone
in
the
world
a
hard
tight
contraction
of
throat
choked
back
a
sob
if
only
he
could
have
had
a
word
with
his
father
but
no
grief
nothing
could
detract
from
the
splendid
truth
of
his
last
message
in
the
black
hours
soon
to
come
kurt
would
have
that
to
sustain
him
chapter
xiii
the
bright
sun
of
morning
disclosed
that
wide
rolling
region
of
the
bend
to
be
a
dreary
blackened
waste
surrounding
one
great
rich
and
mellow
and
golden
kurt
dorn
neighbor
olsen
in
his
kind
and
way
making
obligation
seem
slight
took
charge
of
kurt
affairs
and
made
the
necessary
and
difficult
decisions
nothing
must
delay
the
harvesting
and
transporting
of
the
wheat
the
women
folk
arranged
for
the
burial
of
old
chris
dorn
kurt
sat
and
moved
about
in
a
gloomy
kind
of
trance
for
a
day
and
a
half
until
his
father
was
laid
to
rest
beside
his
mother
in
the
little
graveyard
on
the
windy
hill
after
that
his
mind
slowly
cleared
he
kept
to
himself
the
remainder
of
that
day
avoiding
the
crowd
of
harvesters
camping
in
the
yard
and
adjacent
field
and
at
sunset
he
went
to
a
lonely
spot
on
the
verge
of
the
valley
where
with
sad
eyes
he
watched
the
last
rays
of
sunlight
fade
over
the
blackened
hills
all
these
hours
had
seemed
consecrated
to
his
father
memory
to
remembered
acts
of
kindness
and
of
love
of
the
relation
that
had
gone
and
would
never
be
again
reproach
and
remorse
had
abided
with
him
until
that
sunset
hour
when
the
load
eased
off
his
heart
next
morning
he
went
out
to
the
what
a
wonderful
harvesting
scene
greeted
kurt
dorn
never
had
its
like
been
seen
in
the
northwest
nor
perhaps
in
any
other
place
a
huge
pall
of
dust
chaff
and
smoke
hung
over
the
vast
and
the
air
seemed
charged
with
a
roar
the
glaring
gold
of
the
appeared
to
be
crisscrossed
everywhere
with
bobbing
black
streaks
of
horses
bays
blacks
whites
and
reds
by
big
moving
painted
machines
lifting
arms
and
puffing
straw
by
immense
wagons
piled
high
with
sheaves
of
wheat
lumbering
down
to
the
smoking
engines
and
the
threshers
that
sent
long
streams
of
dust
and
chaff
over
the
lifting
by
wagons
following
the
combines
to
pick
up
the
plump
brown
sacks
of
wheat
and
by
a
string
of
empty
wagons
coming
in
from
the
road
olsen
was
rushing
thirty
combine
threshers
three
engine
forty
and
over
a
hundred
men
well
known
to
him
there
was
a
guard
around
the
field
this
unprecedented
harvest
had
attracted
many
spectators
from
the
little
towns
they
had
come
in
cars
and
on
horseback
and
on
foot
olsen
trusted
no
man
on
that
field
except
those
he
knew
the
wonderful
was
cut
into
a
thousand
squares
and
angles
and
lanes
and
curves
the
big
whirring
combines
passed
one
another
stopped
and
waited
and
turned
out
of
the
way
leaving
everywhere
little
patches
and
cubes
of
standing
wheat
that
soon
fell
before
the
onslaught
of
the
smaller
combines
this
scene
had
no
regularity
it
was
one
of
confusion
of
awkward
halts
delays
hurries
of
accident
the
wind
blew
clouds
of
dust
and
chaff
alternately
clearing
one
space
to
cloud
another
and
a
strange
roar
added
the
last
heroic
touch
to
this
heroic
field
it
was
indeed
the
roar
of
battle
men
and
horses
governing
the
action
of
machinery
and
all
fighting
time
for
in
delay
was
peril
to
the
wheat
once
kurt
ran
across
the
tireless
and
implacable
olsen
he
seemed
a
man
of
dust
and
sweat
and
fury
she
half
cut
an
over
twenty
thousand
bushels
gone
to
the
railroad
he
exclaimed
an
we
speedin
up
olsen
i
do
get
what
going
on
replied
kurt
all
this
is
like
a
dream
wake
up
you
be
out
of
debt
an
a
rich
man
in
three
days
added
olsen
and
went
his
way
in
the
afternoon
kurt
set
out
to
work
as
he
had
never
worked
in
his
life
there
was
need
of
his
strong
hands
in
many
places
but
he
could
not
choose
any
one
labor
and
stick
by
it
for
long
he
wanted
to
do
all
it
was
as
if
this
was
not
a
real
and
wonderful
harvest
of
his
greatest
wheat
yield
but
something
that
embodied
all
years
all
harvests
his
father
death
the
lifting
of
the
old
hard
debt
the
days
when
he
had
trod
the
fields
barefoot
and
this
day
when
strangely
enough
all
seemed
over
for
him
peace
dwelt
with
him
yet
no
hope
behind
his
calm
he
could
have
found
the
old
dread
had
he
cared
to
look
deeply
he
loved
these
heroic
workers
of
the
fields
it
had
been
given
to
him
a
great
task
to
be
the
means
of
creating
a
test
for
them
his
neighbors
under
a
ban
of
suspicion
and
now
he
could
swear
they
were
as
true
as
the
gold
of
the
waving
wheat
more
than
a
harvest
was
this
most
strenuous
and
colorful
of
all
times
ever
known
in
the
bend
it
had
a
significance
that
uplifted
him
it
was
american
first
kurt
began
to
load
bags
of
wheat
as
they
fell
from
the
whirring
combines
into
the
wagons
for
his
powerful
arms
a
full
bag
containing
two
bushels
was
like
a
toy
for
a
child
with
a
lift
and
a
heave
he
threw
a
bag
into
a
wagon
they
were
everywhere
these
brown
bags
dotting
the
stubble
field
appearing
as
if
by
magic
in
the
wake
of
the
machines
they
rolled
off
the
platforms
this
toil
because
it
was
hard
and
heavy
held
kurt
for
an
hour
but
it
could
not
satisfy
his
enormous
hunger
to
make
that
whole
harvest
his
own
he
passed
to
pitching
sheaves
of
wheat
and
then
to
driving
in
the
wagons
from
that
he
progressed
to
a
seat
on
one
of
the
immense
combines
where
he
drove
horses
no
driver
there
was
any
surer
than
kurt
of
his
aim
with
the
little
stones
he
threw
to
spur
a
lagging
horse
kurt
had
felt
this
when
as
a
boy
he
had
begged
to
be
allowed
to
try
his
hand
he
liked
the
shifty
cloud
of
fragrant
chaff
now
and
then
blinding
and
choking
him
and
he
liked
the
steady
rhythmic
tramps
of
hooves
and
the
roaring
whir
of
the
great
complicated
machine
it
fascinated
him
to
see
the
wide
swath
of
nodding
wheat
tremble
and
sway
and
fall
and
go
sliding
up
into
the
inside
of
that
grinding
maw
and
come
out
straw
and
dust
and
chaff
and
a
slender
stream
of
gold
filling
the
bags
this
day
kurt
dorn
was
gripped
by
the
unknown
some
instinct
of
future
drove
him
set
his
spiritual
need
and
made
him
register
with
his
senses
all
that
was
so
beautiful
and
good
and
heroic
in
the
scene
about
him
strangely
now
and
then
a
thought
of
lenore
anderson
entered
his
mind
and
made
sudden
havoc
it
tended
to
retard
action
he
trembled
and
thrilled
with
a
realization
that
every
hour
brought
closer
the
meeting
he
could
not
avoid
and
he
discovered
that
it
was
whenever
this
memory
recurred
that
he
had
to
leave
off
his
present
task
and
rush
to
another
only
thus
could
he
forget
her
the
late
afternoon
found
him
feeding
sheaves
of
wheat
to
one
of
the
he
stood
high
upon
a
platform
and
pitched
sheaves
from
the
wagons
upon
the
sliding
track
of
the
ponderous
rattling
the
engine
stood
off
fifty
yards
or
more
connected
by
an
endless
to
the
thresher
here
indeed
were
whistle
and
roar
and
whir
and
the
shout
of
laborers
and
the
smell
of
smoke
sweat
dust
and
wheat
kurt
had
arms
of
steel
if
they
tired
he
never
knew
it
he
toiled
and
he
watched
the
long
spout
of
chaff
and
straw
as
it
streamed
from
the
thresher
to
lift
magically
a
glistening
stack
and
he
felt
as
a
last
and
cumulative
change
his
physical
effort
and
the
physical
adjuncts
of
the
scene
pass
into
something
spiritual
into
his
heart
and
his
memory
the
end
of
that
came
as
a
surprise
to
kurt
obsessed
with
his
own
emotions
he
had
actually
helped
to
cut
the
wheat
and
harvest
it
he
had
seen
it
go
swath
by
swath
he
had
watched
the
huge
wagons
lumber
away
and
the
huge
rise
without
realizing
that
the
hours
of
this
wonderful
harvest
were
numbered
sight
of
olsen
coming
in
from
across
the
field
and
the
sudden
cessation
of
roar
and
action
made
kurt
aware
of
the
end
it
seemed
a
calamity
but
olsen
was
smiling
through
his
face
about
him
were
relaxation
an
air
of
finality
and
a
subtle
pride
we
through
he
said
she
tallies
thousand
seven
hundred
an
bushels
it
too
bad
the
old
man
could
live
to
hear
that
olsen
gripped
kurt
hand
and
wrung
it
boy
i
reckon
you
ought
to
take
that
a
little
cheerfuller
he
went
on
but
well
it
been
a
hard
time
the
men
are
leavin
now
in
two
hours
the
last
wagons
will
unload
at
the
railroad
the
wheat
will
all
be
in
the
warehouse
an
our
worry
ended
i
i
hope
so
responded
kurt
he
seemed
overcome
with
the
passionate
longing
to
show
his
gratitude
to
olsen
but
the
words
would
not
flow
i
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
all
my
life
we
beat
the
interposed
the
farmer
heartily
an
now
you
do
dorn
why
i
hustle
to
kilo
get
my
money
send
you
a
check
for
yourself
and
men
pay
off
the
debt
to
anderson
and
then
but
kurt
did
not
conclude
his
speech
his
last
words
were
it
turned
out
well
said
olsen
with
satisfaction
and
shaking
hands
again
with
kurt
he
strode
back
to
his
horses
at
last
the
wide
sloping
field
was
bare
except
for
the
huge
a
bright
procession
lumbered
down
the
road
led
by
the
long
strings
of
wagons
filled
with
brown
bags
a
strange
silence
had
settled
down
over
the
farm
the
wheat
was
gone
that
waving
stretch
of
gold
had
fallen
to
the
thresher
and
the
grain
had
been
hauled
away
the
neighbors
had
gone
leaving
kurt
rich
in
bushels
of
wheat
and
richer
for
the
hearty
farewells
and
the
grips
of
horny
hands
kurt
heart
was
full
it
was
evening
kurt
had
finished
his
supper
already
he
had
packed
a
few
things
to
take
with
him
on
the
morrow
he
went
out
to
the
front
of
the
house
stars
were
blinking
there
was
a
low
hum
of
insects
from
the
fields
he
missed
the
soft
silken
rustle
of
the
wheat
and
now
it
seemed
he
could
sit
there
in
the
quiet
darkness
in
that
spot
which
had
been
made
sweet
by
lenore
anderson
presence
and
think
of
her
the
meeting
soon
to
come
the
feeling
abiding
with
him
then
must
have
been
happiness
because
he
was
not
used
to
it
without
deserving
anything
he
had
asked
a
great
deal
of
fate
and
lo
it
had
been
given
him
all
was
well
that
ended
well
he
realized
now
the
terrible
depths
of
despair
into
which
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
plunged
he
had
been
weak
wrong
selfish
there
was
something
that
guided
events
he
needed
to
teach
himself
all
this
with
strong
and
repeated
force
so
that
when
he
went
to
give
lenore
anderson
the
opportunity
to
express
her
gratitude
to
see
her
sweet
face
again
and
to
meet
the
strange
warm
glance
of
her
blue
eyes
so
mysterious
and
somehow
mocking
he
could
be
a
man
of
restraint
of
pride
like
any
american
like
any
other
college
man
she
knew
this
was
no
time
for
a
man
to
leave
a
girl
bearing
a
burden
of
his
unsolicited
love
haunted
perhaps
by
a
generous
reproach
that
she
might
have
been
a
little
to
blame
he
had
told
her
the
truth
and
so
far
he
had
been
dignified
now
let
him
bid
her
leaving
no
sorrow
for
her
and
once
out
of
her
impelling
presence
let
come
what
might
come
he
could
love
her
then
he
could
dare
what
he
had
never
dared
he
could
surrender
himself
to
the
furious
insistent
sweetness
of
a
passion
that
was
sheer
bliss
in
its
expression
he
could
imagine
kisses
on
the
red
lips
that
were
not
for
him
a
husky
shout
from
somewhere
in
the
rear
of
the
house
diverted
attention
he
listened
it
came
again
his
name
it
seemed
a
strange
call
from
out
of
the
troubled
past
that
had
just
ended
he
hurried
through
the
house
to
the
kitchen
the
woman
stood
holding
a
lamp
staring
at
jerry
jerry
appeared
to
have
sunk
against
the
wall
his
face
was
pallid
with
drops
of
sweat
standing
out
with
distorted
quivering
lower
jaw
he
could
not
look
at
kurt
he
could
not
speak
with
shaking
hand
he
pointed
toward
the
back
of
the
house
filled
with
nameless
dread
kurt
rushed
out
he
saw
nothing
unusual
heard
nothing
rapidly
he
walked
out
through
the
yard
and
suddenly
he
saw
a
glow
in
the
sky
above
the
barns
then
he
ran
so
that
he
could
get
an
unobstructed
view
of
the
valley
the
instant
he
obtained
this
he
halted
as
if
turned
to
stone
the
valley
was
a
place
of
yellow
light
he
stared
with
the
all
burned
what
was
the
meaning
of
such
a
big
light
that
broad
flare
had
a
center
low
down
on
the
valley
floor
as
he
gazed
a
monstrous
flame
leaped
up
lighting
colossal
pillars
of
smoke
that
swirled
upward
and
showing
plainer
than
in
day
the
big
warehouse
and
lines
of
at
the
railroad
station
eight
miles
distant
my
god
gasped
kurt
the
warehouse
my
wheat
on
fire
clear
and
unmistakable
was
the
horrible
truth
kurt
heard
the
roar
of
the
sinister
flames
transfixed
he
stood
there
at
first
hardly
able
to
see
and
to
comprehend
for
miles
the
valley
was
as
light
as
at
noonday
an
awful
beauty
attended
the
scene
how
lurid
and
sinister
the
red
heart
of
that
fire
how
weird
and
hellish
and
impressive
of
destruction
those
black
clouds
of
smoke
he
saw
the
disappear
under
this
fierce
blazing
and
smoking
pall
he
watched
for
what
seemed
endless
moments
he
saw
the
changes
of
that
fire
swift
and
terrible
and
only
then
did
kurt
dorn
awaken
to
the
full
sense
of
the
calamity
all
that
work
olsen
sacrifice
and
the
farmers
my
death
all
for
nothing
whispered
kurt
they
only
waited
those
fiends
to
fire
the
warehouse
and
the
cars
the
catastrophe
had
fallen
the
wheat
was
burning
he
was
ruined
his
wheatland
must
go
to
anderson
kurt
thought
first
and
most
poignantly
of
the
noble
farmers
who
had
sacrificed
the
little
in
their
to
save
the
much
in
his
never
could
he
repay
them
then
he
became
occupied
with
a
horrible
heat
that
seemed
to
have
come
from
the
burning
warehouse
to
all
his
pulses
and
veins
and
to
his
heart
and
his
soul
this
fiendish
work
as
had
been
forecast
was
the
work
of
the
behind
it
was
glidden
and
perhaps
behind
him
was
the
grasping
black
lust
of
german
might
kurt
loss
was
no
longer
abstract
or
problematical
it
was
a
loss
so
real
and
terrible
that
it
confounded
him
he
shook
and
gasped
and
reeled
he
wrung
his
hands
and
beat
his
breast
while
the
tumult
swayed
him
the
physical
hate
at
last
yielding
up
its
significance
what
then
was
his
great
loss
he
could
not
tell
the
thing
was
mighty
like
the
sense
of
terror
and
loneliness
in
the
black
night
not
the
loss
for
his
farmer
neighbors
so
true
in
his
hour
of
trial
not
the
loss
of
his
father
nor
the
wheat
nor
the
land
nor
his
ruined
future
but
it
must
be
a
loss
incalculable
and
insupportable
to
his
soul
his
great
ordeal
had
been
the
need
a
terrible
and
incomprehensible
need
to
kill
something
intangible
in
himself
he
had
meant
to
do
it
and
now
the
need
was
shifted
subject
to
a
baser
instinct
if
there
was
german
blood
in
him
poisoning
the
very
wells
of
his
heart
he
could
have
spilled
it
and
so
whether
living
or
dead
have
repudiated
the
taint
that
was
now
clear
in
his
consciousness
but
a
baser
spark
had
ignited
all
the
primitive
passion
of
the
forebears
he
felt
burning
and
driving
within
him
he
felt
no
noble
fire
he
longed
to
live
to
have
a
hundredfold
his
strength
and
fury
to
be
gifted
with
a
genius
for
time
and
place
and
bloody
deed
to
have
the
set
him
a
thousand
opportunities
to
beat
with
iron
mace
and
cut
with
sharp
bayonet
and
rend
with
hard
hand
to
kill
and
kill
and
kill
the
hideous
thing
that
was
german
chapter
xiv
kurt
rushed
back
to
the
house
encountering
jerry
he
ordered
him
to
run
and
saddle
a
couple
of
horses
then
kurt
got
his
revolver
and
a
box
of
shells
and
throwing
on
his
coat
he
hurried
to
the
barn
jerry
was
leading
out
the
horses
it
took
but
short
work
to
saddle
them
jerry
was
excited
and
talkative
he
asked
kurt
many
questions
which
excited
few
replies
when
kurt
threw
himself
into
the
saddle
jerry
yelled
which
way
down
the
trail
replied
kurt
and
was
off
aw
we
break
our
necks
came
jerry
yell
after
him
kurt
had
no
fear
of
the
dark
he
knew
that
trail
almost
as
well
by
night
as
by
day
his
horse
was
a
mettlesome
colt
that
had
not
been
worked
during
the
harvest
and
he
plunged
down
the
dim
winding
trail
as
if
indeed
to
verify
jerry
fears
presently
the
thin
pale
line
that
was
the
trail
disappeared
on
the
burned
here
kurt
was
at
fault
as
to
direction
but
he
did
not
slacken
the
pace
for
that
he
heard
jerry
pounding
along
in
the
rear
trying
to
catch
up
the
way
the
colt
jumped
ditches
and
washes
and
other
obstructions
proved
his
keen
sight
kurt
let
him
go
and
then
the
ride
became
both
perilous
and
thrilling
kurt
could
not
see
anything
on
the
blackened
earth
but
he
knew
from
the
contour
of
the
hills
just
about
where
to
expect
to
reach
the
fence
and
the
road
and
he
did
not
pull
the
horse
too
soon
when
he
found
the
gate
he
waited
for
jerry
who
could
be
heard
calling
from
the
darkness
kurt
answered
him
here
the
gate
yelled
kurt
as
jerry
came
galloping
up
good
road
all
the
way
now
then
shouted
jerry
to
whom
the
pace
had
evidently
communicated
enthusiasm
the
ride
then
became
a
race
with
kurt
drawing
ahead
kurt
could
see
the
road
a
broad
pale
belt
dividing
the
blackness
on
either
side
and
he
urged
the
colt
to
a
run
the
wind
cut
short
kurt
breath
beat
at
his
ears
and
roared
about
them
closer
and
closer
drew
the
red
flare
of
the
dying
fire
casting
long
rays
of
light
into
kurt
eyes
the
colt
was
almost
run
out
when
he
entered
the
circle
of
reddish
flare
kurt
saw
the
glowing
ruins
of
the
elevators
and
a
long
fiery
line
of
burned
to
the
wheels
men
were
running
and
shouting
round
in
front
of
the
little
railroad
station
and
several
were
on
the
roof
with
brooms
and
buckets
the
had
burned
and
evidently
the
station
itself
had
been
on
fire
across
the
wide
street
of
the
little
village
the
roof
of
a
cottage
was
burning
men
were
on
top
of
it
beating
the
shingles
hoarse
yells
greeted
kurt
as
he
leaped
out
of
the
saddle
he
heard
screams
of
frightened
women
on
the
other
side
of
the
burned
a
long
thin
column
of
sparks
rose
straight
upward
over
the
ruins
of
the
elevators
hung
a
pall
of
heavy
smoke
just
then
jerry
came
galloping
up
his
lean
face
red
in
the
glow
thet
you
kurt
say
the
sons
of
guns
are
burnin
down
the
town
he
leaped
off
lem
me
have
your
bridle
i
tie
the
hosses
up
find
out
what
we
can
do
kurt
ran
here
and
there
possessed
by
impotent
rage
the
wheat
was
gone
that
fact
gave
him
a
hollow
sickening
pang
he
met
farmers
he
knew
they
all
threw
up
their
hands
at
sight
of
him
not
one
could
find
a
voice
finally
he
met
olsen
the
little
wheat
farmer
was
white
with
passion
he
carried
a
gun
hello
dorn
ai
this
hell
they
got
your
wheat
he
said
hoarsely
olsen
how
it
happen
was
anybody
set
to
guard
the
elevators
yes
but
the
drove
all
the
guards
off
but
grimm
an
they
beat
him
up
bad
nobody
had
nerve
enough
to
shoot
olsen
if
i
run
into
the
glidden
i
kill
him
declared
kurt
so
will
i
but
dorn
they
a
hard
crowd
they
over
there
on
the
side
watchin
the
fire
a
gang
of
them
soon
as
i
can
get
the
men
together
we
drive
them
out
of
town
there
be
a
fight
if
i
miss
my
guess
hurry
the
men
have
all
of
them
get
their
guns
come
on
not
yet
dorn
we
fightin
fire
yet
you
an
jerry
help
all
you
can
indeed
it
appeared
there
was
danger
of
more
than
one
cottage
burning
the
exceedingly
dry
weather
of
the
past
weeks
had
made
shingles
like
tinder
and
wherever
a
glowing
spark
fell
on
them
there
straightway
was
a
smoldering
fire
water
a
scarce
necessity
in
that
region
had
been
used
until
all
wells
and
pumps
became
dry
it
was
fortunate
that
most
of
the
roofs
of
the
little
village
had
been
constructed
of
galvanized
iron
beating
out
blazes
and
glowing
embers
with
brooms
was
not
effective
enough
when
it
appeared
that
the
one
cottage
nearest
the
rain
of
sparks
was
sure
to
go
kurt
thought
of
the
railroad
watertank
below
the
station
he
led
a
number
of
men
with
buckets
to
the
tank
and
they
soon
drowned
out
the
smoldering
places
meanwhile
the
blazes
from
the
died
out
leaving
only
the
dull
glow
from
the
red
heap
that
had
once
been
the
elevators
however
this
gave
forth
light
enough
for
any
one
to
be
seen
a
few
rods
distant
sparks
had
ceased
to
fall
and
from
that
source
no
further
danger
need
be
apprehended
olsen
had
been
going
from
man
to
man
sending
those
who
were
not
armed
home
for
guns
so
it
came
about
that
half
an
hour
after
kurt
arrival
a
score
of
farmers
villagers
and
a
few
railroaders
were
collected
in
a
group
listening
to
the
olsen
men
there
only
a
few
of
us
an
there
hundreds
mebbe
in
thet
gang
but
we
got
to
drive
them
off
he
said
doggedly
there
no
tellin
what
they
do
if
we
let
them
hang
around
any
longer
they
know
we
weak
in
numbers
we
got
to
do
some
to
scare
them
away
kurt
seconded
olsen
in
ringing
voice
they
threatened
your
homes
he
said
they
burned
my
wheat
ruined
me
they
were
the
death
of
my
father
these
are
facts
i
telling
you
we
ca
wait
for
law
or
for
militia
we
got
to
meet
this
invasion
they
have
taken
advantage
of
the
war
situation
they
backed
by
german
agents
it
now
a
question
of
our
property
we
got
to
fight
the
crowd
made
noisy
and
determined
response
most
of
them
had
small
weapons
a
few
had
or
rifles
come
on
men
called
olsen
i
do
the
talkin
an
if
i
say
shoot
why
you
shoot
it
was
necessary
to
go
around
the
long
line
of
olsen
led
the
way
with
kurt
just
back
of
him
the
men
spoke
but
little
and
in
whispers
at
the
left
end
of
the
line
the
darkness
was
thick
enough
to
make
objects
indistinct
once
around
the
corner
kurt
plainly
descried
a
big
dark
crowd
of
men
whose
faces
showed
red
in
the
glow
of
the
huge
pile
of
embers
which
was
all
that
remained
of
the
elevators
they
did
not
see
olsen
men
hold
on
whispered
olsen
if
we
get
in
a
fight
here
we
be
in
a
bad
place
we
nothin
to
hide
behind
let
go
off
more
to
the
left
come
up
behind
those
on
the
switches
that
give
us
cover
an
we
have
the
in
the
light
so
he
led
off
to
the
left
keeping
in
the
shadow
and
climbed
between
several
lines
of
all
empty
and
finally
came
out
behind
the
olsen
led
to
within
fifty
yards
of
them
and
was
halted
by
some
observant
member
of
the
gang
who
sat
with
the
others
on
top
of
a
this
man
yell
stilled
the
coarse
talk
and
laughter
of
the
gang
what
that
shouted
a
cold
clear
voice
with
authority
in
it
kurt
thought
he
recognized
the
voice
and
it
caused
a
bursting
savage
sensation
in
his
blood
here
a
bunch
of
farmers
with
guns
yelled
the
man
from
the
olsen
halted
his
force
near
one
of
the
detached
lines
of
which
he
probably
meant
to
take
advantage
of
in
case
of
a
fight
hey
you
he
shouted
with
all
his
might
there
was
a
moment
silence
there
no
here
replied
the
authoritative
voice
kurt
was
sure
now
that
he
recognized
glidden
voice
excitement
and
anger
then
gave
place
to
deadly
rage
who
are
you
yelled
olsen
we
tramps
watchin
the
fire
came
the
reply
you
set
that
fire
no
we
did
kurt
motioned
olsen
to
be
silent
as
with
lifting
breast
he
took
an
involuntary
step
forward
glidden
i
know
you
he
shouted
in
hard
quick
tones
i
kurt
dorn
i
met
you
i
know
your
voice
take
your
gang
get
out
of
here
or
we
kill
you
this
pregnant
speech
caused
a
blank
dead
silence
then
came
a
white
flash
a
sharp
report
kurt
heard
the
thud
of
a
bullet
striking
some
one
near
him
the
man
cried
out
but
did
not
fall
spread
out
an
hide
ordered
olsen
an
shoot
fer
keeps
the
little
crowd
broke
and
melted
into
the
shadows
behind
and
under
the
kurt
crawled
under
a
car
and
between
the
wheels
from
which
he
looked
out
glidden
gang
were
there
in
the
red
glow
most
of
them
now
standing
the
sentry
who
had
given
the
alarm
still
sat
on
top
of
the
swinging
his
legs
his
companions
however
had
jumped
down
kurt
heard
men
of
his
own
party
crawling
and
whispering
behind
him
and
he
saw
dim
dark
sprawling
forms
under
the
far
end
of
the
car
boss
the
hayseeds
have
run
off
called
the
man
from
the
flat
car
laughter
and
jeers
greeted
this
sally
kurt
concluded
it
was
about
time
to
begin
proceedings
resting
his
revolver
on
the
side
of
the
wheel
behind
which
he
lay
he
took
steady
aim
at
the
sentry
holding
low
kurt
was
not
a
good
shot
with
a
revolver
and
the
distance
appeared
to
exceed
fifty
yards
but
as
luck
would
have
it
when
he
pulled
trigger
the
sentry
let
out
a
loud
bawl
of
terror
and
pain
and
fell
off
the
car
to
the
ground
flopping
and
crawling
like
a
crippled
chicken
he
got
out
of
sight
below
kurt
shot
was
a
starter
for
olsen
men
four
or
five
of
the
boomed
at
once
then
the
second
barrels
were
discharged
along
with
a
sharper
cracking
of
small
arms
pandemonium
broke
loose
in
gang
no
doubt
at
least
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
a
medley
of
strange
sharp
enraged
and
anguished
cries
burst
upon
the
air
a
prelude
to
a
wild
stampede
in
a
few
seconds
that
lighted
spot
where
the
had
grouped
was
vacant
and
everywhere
were
fleeing
forms
some
swift
others
slow
so
far
as
kurt
could
see
no
one
had
been
fatally
injured
but
many
had
been
hurt
and
that
fact
augured
well
for
olsen
force
presently
a
shot
came
from
some
hidden
enemy
it
thudded
into
the
wood
of
the
car
over
kurt
some
one
on
his
side
answered
it
and
a
heavy
bullet
striking
iron
whined
away
into
the
darkness
then
followed
flash
here
and
flash
there
with
accompanying
reports
and
whistles
of
lead
from
behind
and
under
and
on
top
of
cars
opened
up
a
fire
that
proved
how
well
armed
these
laborers
were
their
volley
completely
drowned
the
desultory
firing
of
olsen
squad
kurt
began
to
wish
for
one
of
the
it
was
this
kind
of
weapon
that
saved
olsen
followers
there
were
a
hundred
chances
to
one
of
missing
an
with
a
single
bullet
while
a
aimed
fairly
well
was
generally
productive
of
results
kurt
stopped
wasting
his
cartridges
some
one
was
hurt
behind
his
car
and
he
crawled
out
to
see
a
villager
named
schmidt
had
been
wounded
in
the
leg
not
seriously
but
bad
enough
to
disable
him
he
had
been
using
a
and
he
wore
a
vest
with
rows
of
shells
in
the
pockets
across
the
front
kurt
borrowed
gun
and
ammunition
and
with
these
he
hurried
back
to
his
covert
grimly
sure
of
himself
at
thought
of
glidden
he
became
hot
all
over
and
this
heat
rather
grew
with
the
excitement
of
battle
with
the
heavy
loaded
kurt
peeped
forth
from
behind
his
protecting
wheel
and
watched
keenly
for
flashes
or
moving
dark
figures
the
had
begun
to
reserve
their
fire
to
shift
their
positions
and
to
spread
out
judging
from
a
wider
range
of
the
reports
it
looked
as
if
they
meant
to
try
and
surround
olsen
band
it
was
extraordinary
the
assurance
and
deadly
intent
of
this
riffraff
gang
of
tramp
in
preceding
years
a
crowd
of
men
had
been
nothing
to
worry
a
rancher
vastly
different
it
seemed
now
they
acted
as
if
they
had
the
great
war
back
of
them
kurt
crawled
out
of
his
and
stole
from
car
to
car
in
search
of
olsen
at
last
he
found
the
rancher
in
company
with
several
men
peering
from
behind
a
car
one
of
his
companions
was
sitting
down
and
trying
to
wrap
something
round
his
foot
olsen
they
spreading
out
to
surround
us
whispered
kurt
that
what
bill
here
just
said
replied
olsen
nervously
if
this
keeps
up
we
be
in
a
tight
place
what
we
do
dorn
we
must
break
and
run
of
all
things
said
kurt
they
burn
the
village
tell
our
men
to
save
their
shells
if
i
only
could
get
some
cracks
at
a
bunch
of
them
together
with
this
big
say
we
been
watchin
that
car
the
one
there
next
the
high
whispered
olsen
it
full
of
them
sometimes
we
see
a
dozen
shots
come
from
it
all
at
once
olsen
i
an
idea
returned
kurt
excitedly
you
fellows
keep
shooting
attract
their
attention
i
slip
below
climb
on
top
of
a
and
get
a
at
that
bunch
it
risky
dorn
said
olsen
with
hesitation
but
if
you
could
get
in
a
few
tellin
shots
start
that
gang
on
the
run
i
try
it
rejoined
kurt
and
forthwith
stole
off
back
toward
the
shadow
it
struck
him
that
there
was
more
light
then
when
the
attack
began
the
fire
had
increased
or
perhaps
the
had
started
another
at
any
rate
the
light
was
growing
stronger
and
likewise
the
danger
greater
as
he
crossed
an
open
space
a
bullet
whizzed
by
him
and
then
another
zipped
by
to
strike
up
the
gravel
ahead
these
were
not
random
shots
some
one
was
aiming
at
him
how
strange
and
to
be
shot
at
deliberately
what
a
remarkable
experience
for
a
young
wheat
farmer
raising
wheat
in
the
great
northwest
had
assumed
responsibilities
he
had
to
run
and
he
was
the
more
furious
because
of
that
another
bullet
flying
wide
hummed
to
his
left
before
he
gained
the
shelter
of
the
farthest
line
of
here
he
hid
and
watched
the
firing
appeared
to
be
all
behind
him
and
thus
encouraged
he
stole
along
to
the
end
of
the
line
of
cars
and
around
a
bright
blaze
greeted
his
gaze
an
isolated
car
was
on
fire
kurt
peered
forth
to
make
sure
of
his
bearings
and
at
length
found
the
high
derrick
by
which
he
had
marked
the
that
he
intended
to
climb
he
could
see
plainly
and
stole
up
to
his
objective
point
with
little
risk
to
himself
until
he
climbed
upon
the
he
crouched
low
almost
on
hands
and
knees
and
finally
gained
the
long
shadow
of
a
shed
between
the
tracks
then
he
ran
past
the
derrick
to
the
dark
side
of
the
car
he
could
now
plainly
see
the
revolver
flashes
and
could
hear
the
thud
and
spang
of
their
bullets
striking
drawing
a
deep
breath
kurt
climbed
up
the
iron
ladder
on
the
dark
side
of
the
car
he
had
the
same
sensation
that
possessed
him
when
he
was
crawling
to
get
a
at
a
flock
of
wild
geese
only
this
was
mightily
more
exciting
he
did
not
forget
the
risk
he
lay
flat
and
crawled
little
by
little
every
moment
he
expected
to
be
discovered
olsen
had
evidently
called
more
of
his
men
to
his
side
for
they
certainly
were
shooting
diligently
kurt
heard
a
continuous
return
fire
from
the
car
he
was
risking
so
much
to
get
a
shot
at
at
length
he
was
within
a
yard
of
the
end
of
the
car
as
far
as
he
needed
to
go
he
rested
a
moment
he
was
laboring
for
breath
sweating
freely
on
fire
with
thrills
his
plan
was
to
raise
himself
on
one
knee
and
fire
as
many
double
shots
as
possible
presently
he
lifted
his
head
to
locate
the
car
it
was
half
in
the
bright
light
half
in
the
shadow
lengthwise
toward
him
about
sixty
or
seventy
yards
distant
and
full
of
men
he
dropped
his
head
tingling
all
over
it
was
a
disappointment
that
the
car
stood
so
far
away
with
fine
shot
he
could
not
seriously
injure
any
of
the
contingent
but
he
was
grimly
sure
of
the
fright
and
hurt
he
could
inflict
in
his
quick
glance
he
had
seen
flashes
of
their
guns
and
many
red
faces
and
dark
huddled
forms
kurt
took
four
shells
and
set
them
end
up
on
the
roof
of
the
car
close
to
him
then
cocking
the
gun
he
cautiously
raised
himself
to
one
knee
he
discharged
both
barrels
at
once
what
a
boom
and
what
a
terrified
outburst
of
yells
swiftly
he
broke
the
gun
reloaded
fired
as
before
and
then
again
the
last
two
shots
were
fired
at
the
men
piling
frantically
over
the
side
of
the
car
yelling
with
fear
kurt
had
heard
the
swishing
pattering
impact
of
those
swarms
of
small
shot
the
gang
ran
down
the
open
track
away
from
kurt
and
toward
the
light
as
he
reloaded
the
gun
he
saw
men
running
from
all
points
to
join
the
gang
with
an
old
blunderbuss
of
a
he
had
routed
the
it
meant
relief
to
olsen
men
but
kurt
had
yet
no
satisfaction
for
the
burning
of
his
wheat
for
the
cruel
shock
that
had
killed
his
father
come
on
olsen
he
yelled
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
they
a
lot
of
cowards
then
in
his
wild
eagerness
he
leaped
off
the
car
the
long
jump
landed
him
jarringly
but
he
did
not
fall
or
lose
hold
of
the
gun
recovering
his
balance
he
broke
into
a
run
kurt
was
fast
on
his
feet
not
a
young
man
of
his
neighborhood
nor
any
of
his
could
outfoot
him
in
a
race
and
then
these
fellows
ran
like
tramps
long
unused
to
such
mode
of
action
and
some
of
them
were
limping
as
they
ran
kurt
gained
upon
them
when
he
got
within
range
he
halted
short
and
freed
two
barrels
a
howl
followed
the
report
some
of
the
fleeing
ones
fell
but
were
dragged
up
and
on
by
companions
kurt
reloaded
and
bounding
forward
like
a
deer
yelling
for
olsen
he
ran
until
he
was
within
range
then
stopped
to
shoot
again
thus
he
continued
until
the
pursued
got
away
from
the
circle
of
light
kurt
saw
the
gang
break
up
some
running
one
way
and
some
another
there
were
sheds
and
cars
and
piles
of
lumber
along
the
track
affording
places
to
hide
kurt
was
halted
by
the
discovery
that
he
had
no
more
ammunition
panting
he
stopped
short
realizing
that
he
had
snapped
an
empty
gun
at
men
either
too
tired
or
too
furious
or
too
desperate
to
run
any
farther
he
out
of
shells
shouted
a
low
hard
voice
that
made
kurt
leap
he
welcomed
the
rush
of
dark
forms
and
swinging
the
gun
round
his
head
made
ready
to
brain
the
first
antagonist
who
neared
him
but
some
one
leaped
upon
him
from
behind
the
onslaught
carried
him
to
his
knees
bounding
up
he
broke
the
gun
stock
on
the
head
of
his
assailant
who
went
down
in
a
heap
kurt
tried
to
pull
his
revolver
it
became
impossible
owing
to
strong
arms
encircling
him
wrestling
he
freed
himself
only
to
be
staggered
by
a
rush
of
several
men
all
pouncing
upon
him
at
once
kurt
went
down
but
once
down
he
heaved
so
powerfully
that
he
threw
off
the
whole
crew
up
again
like
a
cat
he
began
to
fight
big
and
strong
and
swift
with
fists
like
a
blacksmith
kurt
bowled
over
this
assailant
and
that
one
he
thought
he
recognized
glidden
in
a
man
who
kept
out
of
his
reach
and
who
was
urging
on
the
others
kurt
lunged
at
him
and
finally
got
his
hands
on
him
that
was
fatal
for
kurt
because
in
his
fury
he
forgot
comrades
in
one
second
his
big
hand
wrenched
a
yell
of
mortal
pain
out
of
glidden
then
a
combined
attack
of
the
others
rendered
kurt
powerless
a
blow
on
the
head
stunned
him
made
all
dark
chapter
xv
it
seemed
that
kurt
did
not
altogether
lose
consciousness
for
he
had
vague
sensations
of
being
dragged
along
the
ground
presently
the
darkness
cleared
from
his
mind
and
he
opened
his
eyes
he
lay
on
his
back
looking
up
he
saw
stars
through
the
thin
broken
clouds
of
smoke
a
huge
pile
of
railroad
ties
loomed
up
beside
him
he
tried
to
take
note
of
his
situation
his
hands
were
tied
in
front
of
him
not
so
securely
he
imagined
that
he
could
not
work
them
free
his
legs
had
not
been
tied
both
his
head
and
shoulder
on
the
left
side
pained
him
severely
upon
looking
around
kurt
presently
made
out
the
dark
form
of
a
man
he
appeared
rigid
with
attention
but
that
evidently
had
no
relation
to
kurt
the
man
was
listening
and
watching
for
his
comrades
kurt
heard
no
voices
or
shots
after
a
little
while
however
he
thought
he
heard
distant
footsteps
on
the
gravel
he
hardly
knew
what
to
make
of
his
predicament
if
there
was
only
one
guard
over
him
escape
did
not
seem
difficult
unless
that
guard
had
a
gun
hello
you
he
called
hello
yourself
replied
the
man
jerking
up
in
evident
surprise
what
your
name
inquired
kurt
amiably
well
it
ai
hill
or
anderson
came
the
gruff
response
kurt
laughed
but
you
would
be
one
of
those
names
if
you
could
now
would
you
went
on
kurt
my
name
is
dennis

returned
the
man

certainly
is

all
said
kurt
say

fellow
who

the

kurt
i

to
knock
you
on
the
head
why

have
to
eat
standing
up
for
a
month

queried
kurt
the
seat
of
my
pants
must
have
made
a
good
target
for
you
sure
pasted
it
full
of
birdshot
kurt
smothered
a
laugh
then
he
felt
the
old
anger
leap
up
did
you
burn
my
wheat
are
you
that
young
dorn
yes
i
am
replied
kurt
hotly
well
i
did
burn
one
damn
straw
of
your
old
wheat
you
did
but

these
men

fighting
these

the
man
bitterly

a
fine

trying
to

he
care
for
the
interests

me
a
hankering

surprise
me
i
hope

there
for
if

does
he
get

sssssh
whispered
the
guard
here
comes
some
of
the
gang
kurt
heard
low
voices
and
soft
footfalls
some
dark
forms
loomed
up
bradford
has
he
come
to
yet
queried
the
brutal
voice
of
glidden
nope
replied
the
guard
i
guess
he
had
a
hard
knock
he
never
budged
we
got
to
beat
it
out
of
here
said
glidden
it
long
after
midnight
there
a
down
the
track
i
want
all
the
gang
to
board
it
you
run
along
bradford
and
catch
up
with
the
others
what

to
do
with
this
young
fellow
queried
bradford
curiously
that
none
of
your
business

maybe
not
but
i
reckon
i
ask
anyhow
you
want
me
to
join
your
and
i
asking
questions
labor
strikes
standing
up
for
your
rights
is
one
thing
and
burning
wheat
or
slugging
young
farmers
is
another
are
you
going
to
let
this
dorn
go
kurt
could
plainly
see
the
group
of
five
men
bradford
standing
over
the
smaller
glidden
and
the
others
strung
and
silent
in
the
intensity
of
the
moment
i
cut
his
throat
hissed
glidden
bradford
lunged
heavily
the
blow
he
struck
glidden
was
square
in
the
face
glidden
would
have
had
a
hard
fall
but
for
the
obstruction
in
the
shape
of
his
comrades
upon
whom
he
was
knocked
they
held
him
up
glidden
sagged
inertly
evidently
stunned
or
unconscious
bradford
backed
guardedly
away
out
of
their
reach
then
wheeling
he
began
to
run
with
heavy
plodding
strides
glidden
comrades
seemed
anxiously
holding
him
up
peering
at
him
but
no
one
spoke
kurt
saw
his
opportunity
with
one
strong
wrench
he
freed
his
hands
feeling
in
his
pocket
for
his
gun
he
was
disturbed
to
find
that
it
had
been
taken
he
had
no
weapon
but
he
did
not
hesitate
bounding
up
he
rushed
like
a
hurricane
upon
the
unprepared
group
he
saw
glidden
pale
face
upheld
to
the
light
of
the
stars
and
by
it
saw
that
glidden
was
recovering
with
all
his
might
kurt
swung
as
he
rushed
and
the
blow
he
gave
the
leader
far
exceeded
bradford
glidden
was
lifted
so
powerfully
against
one
of
his
men
that
they
both
fell
then
kurt
striking
right
and
left
beat
down
the
other
two
and
leaping
over
them
he
bounded
away
into
the
darkness
shrill
piercing
yells
behind
him
lent
him
wings
but
he
ran
right
into
another
group
of
men
dozens
in
number
he
thought
and
by
the
light
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
fire
they
saw
him
as
quickly
as
he
saw
them
the
yells
behind
were
significant
enough
kurt
had
to
turn
to
run
back
and
he
had
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
men
he
had
assaulted
they
promptly
began
to
shoot
at
kurt
the
whistle
of
lead
was
uncomfortably
close
never
had
he
run
so
fleetly
when
he
flashed
past
the
end
of
the
line
of
cars
into
comparative
open
he
found
himself
in
the
light
of
a
new
fire
this
was
a
shed
perhaps
a
score
of
rods
or
less
from
the
station
some
one
was
yelling
beyond
this
and
kurt
thought
he
recognized
jerry
voice
but
he
did
not
tarry
to
make
sure
bullets
scattering
the
gravel
ahead
of
him
and
singing
around
his
head
and
hoarse
cries
behind
with
a
tread
of
pursuers
gave
kurt
occasion
to
hurry
he
flew
across
the
intending
to
distance
his
pursuers
then
circle
round
the
station
to
the
village
once
he
looked
back
the
gang
well
spread
out
was
not
far
behind
him
just
coming
into
the
light
of
the
new
fire
no
one
in
it
could
ever
catch
him
of
that
kurt
was
sure
suddenly
a
powerful
puff
of
air
like
a
blast
of
wind
seemed
to
lift
him
at
the
same
instant
a
dazzling
blinding
yellow
blaze
illuminated
the
whole
scene
the
solid
earth
seemed
to
rock
under
kurt
flying
feet
and
then
a
terrific
roar
appalled
him
he
was
thrown
headlong
through
the
air
and
all
about
him
seemed
streaks
and
rays
and
bursts
of
fire
he
alighted
to
plow
through
the
dirt
until
the
momentum
of
force
had
been
expended
then
he
lay
prone
gasping
and
choking
almost
blind
but
sensitive
to
the
rain
of
gravel
and
debris
the
fearful
cries
of
terrified
men
taste
of
smoke
and
dust
and
the
rank
smell
of
exploded
gasoline
kurt
got
up
to
grope
his
way
through
the
murky
darkness
he
could
escape
now
if
that
explosion
had
not
killed
his
pursuers
it
had
certainly
scared
them
off
he
heard
men
running
and
yelling
off
to
the
left
a
rumble
of
a
train
came
from
below
the
village
finally
kurt
got
clear
of
the
smoke
to
find
that
he
had
wandered
off
into
one
of
the
fields
opposite
the
station
here
he
halted
to
rest
a
little
and
to
take
cognizance
of
his
condition
it
surprised
him
to
find
out
that
he
was
only
bruised
scratched
and
sore
he
had
expected
to
find
himself
full
of
bullets
whew
they
blew
up
the
he
soliloquized
but
some
of
them
miscalculated
for
if
i
do
lose
my
guess
there
was
a
bunch
of
closer
to
that
gasoline
than
i
was
some
adventure
i
got
another
punch
at
glidden
i
felt
it
in
my
bones
that
i
get
a
crack
at
him
oh
for
another
and
that
bradford
he
did
make
me
think
how
he
slugged
glidden
good
good
there
your
old
american
spirit
coming
out
kurt
sat
down
to
rest
and
to
listen
he
found
he
needed
a
rest
the
only
sound
he
heard
was
the
rumbling
of
a
train
gradually
drawing
away
a
heavy
smoke
rose
from
the
but
there
were
no
longer
any
blazes
or
patches
of
red
fire
perhaps
the
explosion
had
smothered
all
the
flames
it
had
been
a
rather
strenuous
evening
he
reflected
a
good
deal
of
satisfaction
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
had
severely
punished
some
of
the
members
if
he
had
not
done
away
with
any
of
them
when
he
thought
of
glidden
however
he
did
not
feel
any
satisfaction
his
fury
was
gone
but
in
its
place
was
a
strong
judgment
that
such
men
should
be
made
examples
he
certainly
did
not
want
to
run
across
glidden
again
because
if
he
did
he
would
have
blood
on
his
hands
kurt
chance
meeting
with
the
man
bradford
seemed
far
the
most
interesting
if
not
thrilling
incident
of
the
evening
it
opened
up
a
new
point
of
view
how
many
of
the
men
of
that
motley
and
had
grievances
like
bradford
perhaps
there
were
many
kurt
tried
to
remember
instances
when
in
the
northwest
wheat
country
laborers
and
farmers
had
been
cheated
or
deceived
by
men
of
large
interests
it
made
him
grave
to
discover
that
he
could
recall
many
such
instances
his
own
father
had
long
nursed
a
grievance
against
anderson
neuman
his
father
friend
had
a
hard
name
and
there
were
many
who
had
profited
by
the
misfortune
of
others
that
after
all
was
a
condition
of
life
he
took
it
for
granted
then
that
all
members
of
the
were
not
vicious
or
dishonest
he
was
glad
to
have
this
proof
the
had
been
organized
by
labor
agitators
and
they
were
the
ones
to
blame
and
their
punishment
should
be
severest
kurt
began
to
see
where
the
war
cruel
as
it
would
be
was
going
to
be
of
immeasurable
benefit
to
the
country
it
amazed
kurt
presently
to
note
that
dawn
was
at
hand
he
waited
awhile
longer
wanting
to
be
sure
not
to
meet
any
lingering
members
of
the
it
appeared
indeed
that
they
had
all
gone
he
crossed
the
a
black
ruin
still
smoldering
lay
where
the
elevators
had
been
that
wonderful
wheat
yield
of
his
had
been
destroyed
in
the
gray
dawn
it
was
hard
to
realize
he
felt
a
lump
in
his
throat
several
tracks
were
littered
with
the
remains
of
burned
when
kurt
reached
the
street
he
saw
men
in
front
of
the
cottages
some
one
hailed
him
and
then
several
shouted
they
met
him
jerry
and
olsen
were
in
the
party
we
was
pretty
much
scared
said
jerry
and
his
haggard
face
showed
his
anxiety
boy
we
thought
the
had
made
off
with
you
added
olsen
extending
his
hand
not
much
where
are
they
replied
kurt
gone
on
a
when
jerry
blew
up
the
that
fixed
the
jerry
did
you
do
that
queried
kurt
i
reckon
well
you
nearly
blew
me
off
the
map
i
was
running
just
below
the
shed
when
that
explosion
came
i
was
lifted
and
thrown
a
mile
thought
i
never
light
so
far
as
we
can
tell
nobody
was
killed
said
olsen
some
of
our
fellows
have
got
to
nurse
but
no
one
is
bad
hurt
that
good
i
guess
we
came
out
lucky
replied
kurt
you
must
have
had
some
fight
runnin
off
that
way
after
the
we
heard
you
shootin
an
the
yellin
that
part
was
fun
tell
us
what
happened
to
you
so
kurt
had
to
narrate
his
experiences
from
the
time
he
stole
off
with
the
big
until
his
friends
saw
him
again
it
made
rather
a
long
story
which
manifestly
was
of
exceeding
interest
to
the
villagers
dorn
said
one
of
the
men
you
an
jerry
saved
this
here
village
from
bein
burned
we
all
had
a
share
i
sure
glad
they
gone
now
what
damage
was
done
it
turned
out
that
there
had
been
little
hurt
to
the
property
of
the
villagers
some
full
of
barley
loaded
and
billed
by
the
railroad
people
had
been
burned
and
this
loss
of
grain
would
probably
be
paid
for
by
the
company
the
loss
of
wheat
would
fall
upon
kurt
in
the
haste
of
that
great
harvest
and
its
transportation
to
the
village
no
provision
had
been
made
for
loss
the
railroad
company
had
not
accepted
his
wheat
for
transportation
and
was
not
liable
olsen
according
to
our
agreement
i
owe
you
fifteen
thousand
dollars
said
kurt
yes
but
forget
it
replied
olsen
you
the
loser
here
i
pay
it
replied
kurt
but
boy
you
ruined
ejaculated
the
farmer
you
ca
pay
that
big
price
now
an
we
do
expect
it
did
you
leave
your
burning
fields
to
come
help
us
save
ours
queried
kurt
sure
but
there
was
much
of
mine
to
burn
and
so
did
many
of
the
other
men
who
came
to
help
i
tell
you
olsen
that
means
a
great
deal
to
me
i
pay
my
debt
or
or
but
how
can
you
interrupted
olsen
reasonably
sometime
when
you
raise
another
crop
like
this
year
then
you
could
pay
the
farm
will
bring
that
much
more
than
i
owe
anderson
you
give
up
the
farm
exclaimed
olsen
yes
i
square
myself
dorn
we
wo
take
that
money
said
the
farmer
deliberately
you
have
to
take
it
i
send
you
a
check
soon
perhaps
give
up
your
land
repeated
olsen
why
that
unheard
of
land
in
your
family
so
many
years
what
will
you
do
olsen
i
waited
for
the
draft
just
on
account
of
my
father
if
it
had
not
been
for
him
i
have
enlisted
anyway
i
going
to
war
that
silenced
the
little
group
of
men
jerry
get
our
horses
and
we
ride
home
said
kurt
the
tall
foreman
strode
off
kurt
sensed
something
poignant
in
the
feelings
of
the
men
especially
olsen
this
matter
of
the
dealing
had
brought
kurt
and
his
neighbors
closer
together
and
he
thought
it
a
good
opportunity
for
a
few
words
about
the
united
states
and
the
war
and
germany
so
he
launched
forth
into
an
eloquent
expression
of
some
of
his
convictions
he
was
still
talking
when
jerry
returned
with
the
horses
at
length
he
broke
off
rather
abruptly
and
saying
he
mounted
hold
on
kurt
called
olsen
and
left
the
group
to
lay
a
hand
on
the
horse
and
to
speak
low
what
you
said
struck
me
deep
it
applies
pretty
hard
to
us
of
the
bend
we
always
been
farmers
with
no
thought
of
country
an
that
because
we
left
our
native
country
to
come
here
not
german
an
i
never
been
for
germany
but
many
of
my
neighbors
friends
are
germans
this
war
never
has
come
close
till
now
i
know
germans
in
this
country
they
have
left
their
fatherland
an
they
are
lost
to
that
fatherland
it
may
take
some
time
to
stir
them
up
to
make
them
see
but
the
day
will
come
take
my
word
for
it
dorn
the
of
the
northwest
when
it
comes
to
a
pinch
will
find
themselves
an
be
true
to
the
country
they
have
adopted
chapter
xvi
the
sun
was
up
broad
and
bright
burning
over
the
darkened
when
kurt
and
jerry
reached
home
kurt
had
never
seen
the
farm
look
like
that
ugly
and
black
and
bare
but
the
fallow
ground
hundreds
of
acres
of
it
billowing
away
to
the
south
had
not
suffered
any
change
of
color
or
beauty
to
kurt
it
seemed
to
smile
at
him
to
bid
him
wait
for
another
spring
and
that
thought
was
poignant
for
he
remembered
he
must
leave
at
once
for
many
waters
he
found
when
he
came
to
wash
the
blood
and
dirt
from
his
person
that
his
bruises
were
many
there
was
a
lump
on
his
head
and
his
hands
were
skinned
after
changing
his
clothes
and
packing
a
few
things
in
a
valise
along
with
his
papers
he
went
down
to
breakfast
though
preoccupied
in
mind
he
gathered
that
both
the
old
housekeeper
and
jerry
were
surprised
and
dismayed
to
see
him
ready
to
leave
he
had
made
no
mention
of
his
intentions
and
it
struck
him
that
this
somehow
was
going
to
be
hard
indeed
when
the
moment
came
he
found
that
speech
was
difficult
and
his
voice
not
natural
martha
jerry
i
going
away
for
good
he
said
huskily
i
mean
to
make
over
the
farm
to
anderson
i
leave
you
in
charge
here
and
recommend
that
you
be
kept
on
here
your
money
up
to
date
going
away
to
the
war
and
the
chances
are
i
never
come
back
the
old
housekeeper
who
had
been
like
a
mother
to
him
for
many
years
began
to
cry
and
jerry
struggled
with
a
regret
that
he
could
not
speak
abruptly
kurt
left
them
and
hurried
out
of
the
house
how
strange
that
difficult
feelings
had
arisen
emotions
he
had
never
considered
at
all
but
the
truth
was
that
he
was
leaving
his
home
forever
all
was
explained
in
that
first
he
went
to
the
graves
of
his
father
and
mother
out
on
the
south
slope
where
there
were
always
wind
and
sun
the
fire
had
not
desecrated
the
simple
there
was
no
grass
but
a
few
trees
and
bushes
kept
it
from
appearing
bare
kurt
sat
down
in
the
shade
near
his
mother
grave
and
looked
away
across
the
hills
with
dim
eyes
something
came
to
him
a
subtle
assurance
that
his
mother
approved
of
his
going
to
war
kurt
remembered
her
slow
quiet
patient
dominated
by
his
father
the
slope
was
hot
and
still
with
only
a
rustling
of
leaves
in
the
wind
the
air
was
dry
kurt
missed
the
sweet
fragrance
of
wheat
what
odor
there
was
seemed
to
be
like
that
of
burning
weeds
the
great
undulating
open
of
the
bend
extended
on
three
sides
his
parents
had
spent
the
best
of
their
lives
there
and
had
now
been
taken
to
the
bosom
of
the
soil
they
loved
it
seemed
natural
many
were
the
last
of
toilers
of
the
wheat
there
on
those
hills
and
surely
in
the
long
frontier
days
and
in
the
ages
before
men
innumerable
had
gone
back
to
the
earth
from
which
they
had
sprung
the
of
men
were
beautiful
it
was
only
life
that
was
sad
in
this
poignant
revealing
hour
kurt
could
not
resist
human
longings
and
regrets
though
he
gained
incalculable
strength
from
these
two
graves
on
the
windy
slope
it
was
not
for
any
man
to
understand
to
the
uttermost
the
meaning
of
life
when
he
left
he
made
his
way
across
some
of
the
fallow
land
and
some
of
the
stubble
fields
that
had
yielded
alas
so
futilely
such
abundant
harvest
his
boyhood
days
came
back
to
him
when
he
used
to
crush
down
the
stubble
with
his
bare
feet
every
rod
of
the
way
revealed
some
memory
he
went
into
the
barn
and
climbed
into
the
huge
airy
loft
it
smelled
of
straw
and
years
of
dust
and
mice
the
swallows
darted
in
and
out
twittering
how
friendly
they
were
year
after
year
they
had
returned
to
their
nests
the
young
birds
returning
to
the
homes
of
the
old
home
even
for
birds
was
a
thing
of
first
and
vital
importance
it
was
a
very
old
barn
that
had
not
many
more
useful
years
to
stand
kurt
decided
that
he
would
advise
that
it
be
strengthened
there
were
holes
in
the
rough
shingling
and
boards
were
off
the
sides
in
the
corners
and
on
the
rafters
was
an
accumulation
of
grain
dust
as
thick
as
snow
mice
ran
in
and
out
almost
as
tame
as
the
swallows
he
seemed
to
be
taking
leave
of
them
he
recalled
that
he
used
to
chase
and
trap
mice
with
all
a
boy
savage
ingenuity
but
that
boyish
instinct
along
with
so
many
things
so
potential
then
was
gone
now
best
of
all
he
loved
the
horses
most
of
these
were
old
and
had
given
faithful
service
for
many
years
indeed
there
was
one
old
badge
that
had
carried
kurt
when
he
was
a
boy
once
he
and
a
neighbor
boy
had
gone
to
the
pasture
to
fetch
home
the
cows
old
badge
was
there
and
nothing
would
do
but
that
they
ride
him
from
the
fence
kurt
mounted
to
his
broad
back
then
the
neighbor
boy
full
of
the
devil
had
struck
old
badge
with
a
stick
the
horse
set
off
at
a
gallop
for
home
with
kurt
frantically
holding
on
bouncing
up
and
down
on
his
back
that
had
been
the
ride
of
kurt
life
his
father
had
whipped
him
too
for
the
adventure
how
strangely
vivid
and
were
these
ordinary
adjuncts
to
his
life
there
on
the
farm
it
was
only
upon
giving
them
up
that
he
discovered
their
real
meaning
the
hills
of
bare
fallow
and
of
yellow
slope
the
old
barn
with
its
horses
swallows
mice
and
odorous
loft
the
cows
and
chickens
these
appeared
to
kurt
in
the
illuminating
light
of
farewell
in
their
true
relation
to
him
for
they
and
the
labor
of
them
had
made
him
what
he
was
slowly
he
went
back
to
the
old
house
and
climbed
the
stairs
only
three
rooms
were
there
and
one
of
these
his
mother
had
not
been
opened
for
a
long
time
it
seemed
just
the
same
as
when
he
used
to
go
to
her
with
his
stubbed
toes
and
his
troubles
she
had
died
in
that
room
and
now
he
was
a
man
going
out
to
fight
for
his
country
how
strange
why
in
his
mother
room
he
could
not
answer
that
puzzling
question
it
stung
him
and
with
a
last
look
a
and
a
word
of
prayer
on
his
lips
he
turned
to
his
own
little
room
he
entered
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
it
was
small
with
the
slope
of
the
roof
running
down
so
low
that
he
had
learned
to
stoop
when
close
to
the
wall
there
was
no
ceiling
bare
yellow
rafters
and
dark
old
shingles
showed
he
could
see
light
through
more
than
one
little
hole
the
window
was
small
low
and
without
glass
how
many
times
he
had
sat
there
leaning
out
in
the
hot
dusk
of
summer
nights
dreaming
dreams
that
were
never
to
come
true
alas
for
the
hopes
and
illusions
of
boyhood
so
long
as
he
could
remember
this
room
was
most
closely
associated
with
his
actions
and
his
thoughts
it
was
a
part
of
him
he
almost
took
it
into
his
confidence
as
if
it
were
human
never
had
he
become
what
he
had
dared
to
dream
he
would
yet
somehow
at
that
moment
he
was
not
ashamed
it
struck
him
then
what
few
belongings
he
really
had
but
he
had
been
taught
to
get
along
with
little
living
in
that
room
was
over
for
him
he
was
filled
with
unutterable
sadness
yet
he
would
not
have
had
it
any
different
bigger
and
selfless
things
called
to
him
he
was
bidding
farewell
to
his
youth
and
all
that
it
related
to
a
solemn
procession
of
beautiful
memories
passed
through
his
mind
born
of
the
nights
there
in
that
room
of
his
boyhood
with
the
wind
at
the
eaves
and
the
rain
pattering
on
the
shingles
what
strong
and
vivid
pictures
no
grief
no
pain
no
war
could
rob
him
of
this
best
heritage
from
the
past
he
got
up
to
go
and
then
a
blinding
rush
of
tears
burned
his
eyes
this
room
seemed
dearer
than
all
the
rest
of
his
home
it
was
hard
to
leave
his
last
look
was
magnified
transformed
he
whispered
with
a
swelling
constriction
in
his
throat
at
the
head
of
the
dark
old
stairway
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
with
bowed
head
he
slowly
descended
chapter
xvii
an
august
twilight
settled
softly
down
over
many
waters
while
lenore
anderson
dreamily
gazed
from
her
window
out
over
the
darkening
fields
so
tranquil
now
after
the
day
harvest
toil
of
late
in
thoughtful
hours
such
as
this
she
had
become
conscious
of
strain
of
longing
she
had
fought
out
a
battle
with
herself
had
confessed
her
love
for
kurt
dorn
and
surrendering
to
the
enchantment
of
that
truth
had
felt
her
love
grow
with
every
thought
of
him
and
every
beat
of
a
thrilling
pulse
in
spite
of
a
longing
that
amounted
to
pain
and
a
nameless
dread
she
could
not
deny
she
was
happy
and
she
waited
with
a
woman
presaging
sense
of
events
for
a
crisis
that
was
coming
presently
she
heard
her
father
his
heavy
tread
and
hearty
voice
these
strenuous
harvest
days
left
him
little
time
for
his
family
and
lenore
having
lost
herself
in
her
dreams
had
not
of
late
sought
him
out
in
the
fields
she
was
waiting
and
besides
his
keen
eyes
at
once
so
penetrating
and
so
kind
had
confused
her
few
secrets
had
she
ever
kept
from
her
father
where
lenore
she
heard
him
ask
down
in
the
lenorry
mooning
replied
kathleen
with
a
giggle
well
whereabouts
is
she
moonin
went
on
anderson
why
in
her
room
retorted
the
child
and
you
ca
get
a
word
out
of
her
with
a
crowbar
anderson
laugh
rang
out
with
a
jingle
of
tableware
he
was
eating
his
supper
then
lenore
heard
her
mother
and
rose
and
kathleen
all
burst
out
with
news
of
a
letter
come
that
day
from
jim
away
training
to
be
a
soldier
it
was
rose
who
read
this
letter
aloud
to
her
father
and
outside
of
her
swift
soft
voice
the
absolute
silence
attested
to
the
attention
of
the
listeners
lenore
heart
shook
as
she
distinguished
a
phrase
here
and
there
for
jim
letter
had
been
wonderful
for
her
he
had
gained
weight
he
was
getting
husky
enough
to
lick
his
father
he
was
feeling
great
there
was
not
a
boy
in
the
outfit
who
could
beat
him
to
a
stuffed
bag
of
a
german
soldier
and
he
sure
could
make
some
job
with
that
old
bayonet
so
ran
jim
message
to
the
loved
ones
at
home
then
a
strange
pride
replaced
the
quake
in
lenore
heart
not
now
would
she
have
had
jim
stay
home
she
had
sacrificed
him
something
subtler
than
thought
told
her
she
would
never
see
him
again
and
oh
how
dear
he
had
become
then
anderson
roared
his
delight
in
that
letter
and
banged
the
table
with
his
fist
the
girls
excitedly
talked
in
unison
but
the
mother
was
significantly
silent
lenore
forgot
them
presently
and
went
back
to
her
dreaming
it
was
just
about
dark
when
her
father
called
lenore
yes
father
she
replied
i
comin
up
he
said
and
his
heavy
tread
sounded
in
the
hall
it
was
followed
by
the
swift
patter
of
little
feet
say
you
kids
go
back
i
want
to
talk
to
lenore
daddy
came
kathleen
shrill
guilty
whisper
i
was
only
in
fun
about
her
mooning
the
father
laughed
again
and
slowly
mounted
the
stairs
lenore
reflected
uneasily
that
he
seldom
came
to
her
room
also
when
he
was
most
concerned
with
trouble
he
usually
sought
her
hello
all
in
the
dark
he
said
as
he
came
in
may
i
turn
on
the
light
lenore
assented
though
not
quite
readily
but
anderson
did
not
turn
on
the
light
he
bumped
into
things
on
the
way
to
where
she
was
curled
up
in
her
and
he
dropped
wearily
into
lenore
big
how
are
you
daddy
she
inquired
dog
tired
but
feelin
fine
he
replied
i
got
a
meetin
at
eight
an
i
need
a
rest
reckon
i
like
to
smoke
an
talk
to
you
if
you
do
mind
i
sure
rather
listen
to
my
dad
than
any
one
she
replied
softly
she
knew
he
had
come
with
news
or
trouble
or
need
of
help
he
always
began
that
way
she
could
measure
his
mood
by
the
preliminaries
before
his
disclosure
and
she
fortified
herself
was
that
a
great
letter
from
the
boy
began
anderson
as
he
lit
a
cigar
by
the
flash
of
the
match
lenore
got
a
glimpse
of
his
dark
and
unguarded
face
indeed
she
did
well
to
fortify
herself
fine
he
wrote
it
to
me
i
laughed
i
swelled
with
pride
it
sent
my
blood
racing
it
filled
me
with
fight
then
i
sneaked
up
here
to
cry
exclaimed
anderson
with
a
loud
sigh
then
for
a
moment
of
silence
the
end
of
his
cigar
alternately
paled
and
glowed
lenore
did
you
get
any
any
kind
of
a
hunch
from
jim
letter
i
do
exactly
understand
what
you
mean
replied
lenore
did
somethin
strange
an
different
come
to
you
queried
anderson
haltingly
as
if
words
were
difficult
to
express
what
he
meant
why
yes
i
had
many
strange
feelings
jim
letter
was
just
like
he
talks
but
to
me
it
said
somethin
he
never
meant
an
did
know
jim
will
never
come
back
yes
dad
i
divined
just
that
whispered
lenore
strange
about
that
mused
anderson
with
a
pull
on
his
cigar
and
then
followed
a
silence
lenore
felt
how
long
ago
her
father
had
made
his
sacrifice
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
need
for
more
words
about
jim
but
there
seemed
a
bigness
in
the
bond
of
understanding
between
her
and
her
father
a
cause
united
them
and
they
were
sustained
by
unfaltering
courage
the
great
thing
was
the
divine
spark
in
the
boy
who
could
not
have
been
held
back
lenore
gazed
out
into
the
darkening
shadows
the
night
was
very
still
except
for
the
hum
of
insects
and
the
cool
air
felt
sweet
on
her
face
the
shadows
the
silence
the
sleeping
atmosphere
hovering
over
many
waters
seemed
charged
with
a
quality
of
present
sadness
of
the
inexplicable
great
world
moving
to
its
fate
lenore
you
have
been
around
much
lately
resumed
anderson
sure
you
missed
an
jake
swears
a
lot
more
than
usual
father
you
told
me
to
stay
at
home
she
replied
so
i
did
an
i
reckon
it
just
as
well
but
when
did
you
ever
before
mind
me
why
i
always
obey
you
replied
lenore
with
her
low
laugh
not
so
i
notice
it
lenore
have
you
seen
the
big
clouds
of
smoke
driftin
over
waters
these
last
few
days
yes
and
i
smelled
smoke
too
from
forest
fire
is
it
not
there
fire
in
some
of
the
timber
but
the
wind
wrong
for
us
to
get
smoke
from
the
then
where
does
the
smoke
come
from
queried
lenore
quickly
some
of
the
bend
wheat
country
been
burned
over
burned
you
mean
the
wheat
sure
oh
what
part
of
the
bend
i
reckon
it
what
you
called
young
dorn
desert
of
wheat
oh
what
a
pity
have
you
had
word
nothin
but
rumors
yet
but
i
fearin
the
worst
an
i
sorry
for
our
young
friend
a
sharp
pain
shot
through
lenore
breast
leaving
behind
an
ache
it
will
ruin
him
she
whispered
aw
no
not
that
bad
declared
anderson
and
there
was
a
red
streak
in
the
dark
where
evidently
he
waved
his
cigar
in
quick
decisive
action
it
only
be
tough
on
him
an
sort
of
embarrassin
for
me
an
you
that
boy
proud
i
bet
he
raised
hell
among
them
if
he
got
to
them
and
anderson
chuckled
with
the
delight
he
always
felt
in
the
western
appreciation
of
summary
violence
justly
dealt
lenore
felt
the
rising
tide
of
her
anger
she
was
her
father
daughter
yet
always
had
been
slow
to
wrath
that
was
her
mother
softness
and
gentleness
tempering
the
hard
spirit
of
her
father
but
now
her
blood
ran
hot
beating
and
bursting
about
her
throat
and
temples
and
there
was
a
leap
and
quiver
to
her
body
dastards
father
those
foreign
devils
should
be
shot
she
cried
passionately
to
ruin
those
poor
heroic
farmers
to
ruin
that
that
boy
it
a
crime
and
oh
to
burn
his
beautiful
field
of
wheat
with
all
his
hopes
oh
what
shall
i
call
that
wal
lass
i
reckon
it
take
stronger
speech
than
any
you
know
responded
anderson
an
i
usin
that
same
lenore
sat
there
trembling
with
hot
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
with
her
fists
clenched
so
tight
that
her
nails
cut
into
her
palms
rage
only
proved
to
her
how
impotent
she
was
to
avert
catastrophe
how
bitter
and
black
were
some
trials
she
shrank
with
a
sense
of
acute
pain
at
thought
of
the
despair
there
must
be
in
the
soul
of
kurt
dorn
lenore
began
anderson
slowly
his
tone
was
stronger
vibrant
with
feeling
you
love
this
young
dorn
a
tumultuous
shock
shifted
lenore
emotions
she
quivered
as
before
but
this
was
a
long
shuddering
thrill
shot
over
her
by
that
spoken
affirmation
what
she
had
whispered
shyly
and
fearfully
to
herself
when
alone
and
hidden
what
had
seemed
a
wonderful
and
forbidden
secret
her
father
had
spoken
out
lenore
gasped
her
anger
fled
as
it
had
never
been
even
in
the
dark
she
hid
her
face
and
tried
to
grasp
the
wild
whirling
thoughts
and
emotions
now
storming
her
he
had
not
asked
he
had
affirmed
he
knew
she
could
not
deceive
him
even
if
she
would
and
then
for
a
moment
she
was
weak
at
the
mercy
of
contending
tides
sure
i
seen
he
was
in
love
with
you
anderson
was
saying
seen
that
right
off
an
i
reckon
i
not
thought
much
of
him
if
he
been
but
i
was
sure
of
you
till
the
day
dorn
saved
you
from
ruenke
an
fetched
you
back
then
i
seen
an
i
been
waitin
for
you
to
tell
me
there
nothing
to
tell
faltered
lenore
i
reckon
there
is
he
replied
leaning
over
he
threw
his
cigar
out
of
the
window
and
took
hold
of
her
lenore
had
never
felt
him
so
impelling
she
was
not
proof
against
the
strong
warm
pressure
of
his
hand
she
felt
in
its
clasp
as
she
had
when
a
little
girl
a
great
and
sure
safety
it
drew
her
irresistibly
she
crept
into
his
arms
and
buried
her
face
on
his
shoulder
and
she
had
a
feeling
that
if
she
could
not
relieve
her
heart
it
would
burst
oh
d
dad
she
whispered
with
a
soft
hushed
voice
that
broke
tremulously
at
her
lips
i
i
love
him
i
do
love
him
terrible
i
knew
it
that
last
time
you
took
me
to
his
home
when
he
said
he
was
going
to
war
and
oh
now
you
know
anderson
held
her
tight
against
his
broad
breast
that
lifted
her
with
its
great
heave
reckon
that
some
relief
i
was
so
darn
sure
said
anderson
has
he
spoken
to
you
spoken
what
do
you
mean
has
dorn
told
you
he
loved
you
lenore
lifted
her
face
if
that
confession
of
hers
had
been
relief
to
her
father
it
had
been
more
so
to
her
what
had
seemed
terrible
began
to
feel
natural
still
she
was
all
intense
vibrating
internally
convulsed
yes
he
has
she
replied
shyly
but
such
a
confession
he
told
it
as
if
to
explain
what
he
thought
was
boldness
on
his
part
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
me
at
first
sight
and
then
meeting
me
was
too
much
for
him
he
wanted
me
to
know
he
was
going
away
to
war
he
asked
nothing
he
seemed
to
apologize
for
for
daring
to
love
me
he
asked
nothing
and
he
has
absolutely
not
the
slightest
idea
i
care
for
him
wal
i
be
ejaculated
anderson
what
the
matter
with
him
dad
he
is
proud
replied
lenore
dreamily
he
had
a
hard
struggle
out
there
in
his
desert
of
wheat
they
always
been
poor
he
imagines
there
a
vast
distance
between
an
heiress
of
waters
and
a
farmer
boy
then
more
than
all
i
think
the
war
has
fixed
a
morbid
trouble
in
his
mind
god
knows
it
must
be
real
enough
a
house
divided
against
itself
is
what
he
called
his
home
his
father
is
german
he
is
american
he
worshiped
his
mother
who
was
a
native
of
the
united
states
he
has
become
estranged
from
his
father
i
do
know
i
not
sure
but
i
felt
that
he
was
obsessed
by
a
calamity
in
his
german
blood
i
divined
that
was
the
great
reason
for
his
eagerness
to
go
to
war
wal
kurt
dorn
not
goin
to
war
replied
her
father
i
fixed
that
all
right
an
amazing
and
rapturous
start
thrilled
over
lenore
daddy
she
cried
leaping
up
in
his
arms
what
have
you
done
i
got
exemption
for
him
that
what
replied
anderson
with
great
satisfaction
exemption
exclaimed
lenore
in
bewilderment
do
you
remember
the
government
official
from
washington
you
met
him
in
spokane
he
was
out
west
to
inspire
the
farmers
to
raise
more
wheat
there
are
many
young
farmers
needed
a
thousand
times
more
on
the
than
on
the
an
kurt
dorn
is
one
of
them
that
boy
will
make
the
biggest
sower
of
wheat
in
the
northwest
i
recommended
exemption
for
dorn
an
he
exempted
an
does
know
it
does
know
he
accept
exemption
declared
lenore
lass
i
some
worried
myself
rejoined
anderson
reckon
explained
dorn
to
me
that
somethin
queer
about
him
but
sensible
he
can
be
told
things
an
he
see
how
much
more
he
needed
to
raise
wheat
than
to
kill
germans
but
father
suppose
he
to
kill
germans
asked
lenore
earnestly
how
strangely
she
felt
things
about
dorn
that
she
could
not
explain
then
by
george
it
up
to
you
my
girl
replied
her
father
grimly
understand
me
i
no
sentiment
about
dorn
in
this
matter
one
good
is
worth
a
dozen
soldiers
to
win
the
war
to
feed
our
country
after
the
war
why
only
a
man
like
me
knows
what
it
take
it
means
millions
of
bushels
of
wheat
i
sent
my
own
boy
fight
with
the
best
or
the
worst
of
them
but
he
never
been
a
man
to
raise
wheat
all
jim
ever
raised
is
hell
an
his
kind
is
needed
now
so
let
him
go
to
war
but
dorn
must
be
kept
home
an
that
up
to
lenore
anderson
me
oh
how
cried
lenore
faintly
woman
wiles
daughter
said
anderson
with
his
frank
laugh
when
dorn
comes
let
me
try
to
show
him
his
duty
the
northwest
ca
spare
young
men
like
him
he
see
that
if
he
has
lost
his
wheat
he
come
down
here
to
make
me
take
the
land
in
payment
of
the
debt
i
accept
it
then
he
say
he
goin
to
war
an
then
i
say
he
ai
we
have
it
out
i
offer
him
such
a
chance
here
an
in
the
bend
that
he
have
to
be
crazy
to
refuse
but
if
he
has
got
a
twist
in
his
mind
if
he
thinks
he
got
to
go
out
an
kill
germans
then
you
have
to
change
him
but
dad
how
on
earth
can
i
do
that
implored
lenore
distracted
between
hope
and
joy
and
fear

woman
now
an
women
are
in
this
war
up
to
their
eyes

doin
more
to
keep

can
make
him
stay
an
it

future

happiness
child

his
arms
whispered
lenore
very
low
reckon
i
did
mean

to
returned
anderson
gruffly
then
if
if
he
does
not
ask
me
to
to
marry
him
how
can
i
lenore
no
man
on
earth
could
resist
you
if
you

sweet
as

sometimes
dorn

never
leave
you
i
not
so
sure
of
that
daddy
she
murmured
then
take
my
word
for
it
he
replied
and
he
got
up
from
the
chair
though
still
holding
her
i
have
to
go
now
but
i
shown
my
hand
to

a
finer
lad

here

point
he

slacker
to

do
more
good
here
then
outside
of
bein
a
wheat
man
for
his
army
an
his
country
he
can
be
one
for
me
i
growin
old
my
lass
here
the
biggest
ranch
in
washington
to
look
after
an
i
want
kurt
dorn
to
look
after
it
now
lenore
do
we
understand
each
other
she
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
dear
old
daddy
you
the
wonderfulest
father
any
girl
ever
had
i
would
do
my
best
i
would
obey
even
if
i
did
not
love
kurt
dorn
to
hear
you
speak
so
of
him
oh
its
sweet
it
chokes
me
now
hurry
before
i
she
kissed
him
and
gently
pushed
him
out
of
the
room
then
before
the
sound
of
his
slow
footfalls
had
quite
passed
out
of
hearing
she
lay
prone
upon
her
bed
her
face
buried
in
the
pillow
her
hands
clutching
the
coverlet
utterly
surrendered
to
a
breaking
storm
of
emotion
terrible
indeed
had
come
that
presaged
crisis
of
her
life
love
of
her
wild
brother
jim
gone
to
atone
forever
for
the
errors
of
his
youth
love
of
her
father
confessing
at
last
the
sad
fear
that
haunted
him
love
of
dorn
that
stalwart
lad
who
set
his
face
so
bravely
toward
a
hopeless
tragic
fate
these
were
the
burden
of
the
flood
of
her
passion
and
all
they
involved
rushing
her
from
girlhood
into
womanhood
calling
to
her
with
imperious
desires
with
deathless
loyalty
chapter
xviii
after
lenore
paroxysm
of
emotion
had
subsided
and
she
lay
quietly
in
the
dark
she
became
aware
of
soft
hurried
footfalls
passing
along
the
path
below
her
window
at
first
she
paid
no
particular
heed
to
them
but
at
length
the
steady
steps
became
so
different
in
number
and
so
regular
in
passing
every
few
moments
that
she
was
interested
to
go
to
her
window
and
look
out
watching
there
awhile
she
saw
a
number
of
men
whispering
and
talking
low
come
from
the
road
pass
under
her
window
and
disappear
down
the
path
into
the
grove
then
no
more
came
lenore
feared
at
first
these
strange
visitors
might
be
prowling
men
she
concluded
however
that
they
were
neighbors
and
come
for
secret
conference
with
her
father
important
events
were
pending
and
her
father
had
not
taken
her
into
his
confidence
it
must
be
then
something
that
he
did
not
wish
her
to
know
only
a
week
ago
when
the
menace
had
begun
to
be
serious
she
had
asked
him
how
he
intended
to
meet
it
and
particularly
how
he
would
take
sure
measures
to
protect
himself
anderson
had
laughed
down
her
fears
and
lenore
absorbed
in
her
own
tumult
had
been
easily
satisfied
but
now
with
her
curiosity
there
returned
a
dread
she
put
on
a
cloak
and
went
the
hour
was
still
early
she
heard
the
girls
with
her
mother
in
the
as
lenore
slipped
out
she
encountered
jake
he
appeared
to
loom
right
out
of
the
darkness
and
he
startled
her
howdy
miss
lenore
he
said
where
might
you
be
goin
jake
i
curious
about
the
men
i
heard
passing
by
my
window
she
replied
then
she
observed
that
jake
had
a
rifle
under
his
arm
and
she
added
what
are
you
doing
with
that
gun
wal
i
sort
of
gone
back
to
packin
a
winchester
replied
jake
lenore
missed
his
smile
ever
ready
for
her
jake
looked
somber
you
on
guard
she
exclaimed
i
reckon
there
four
of
us
boys
round
the
house
you
not
goin
off
thet
step
miss
lenore
oh
replied
lenore
imitating
her
father
and
bantering
jake
more
for
the
fun
of
it
than
from
any
intention
of
disobeying
him
going
to
keep
me
from
it
i
am
boss
orders
miss
lenore
i
sorry
but
you
sure
ought
to
be
outdoors
this
far
replied
jake
look
here
my
cowboy
dictator
i
going
to
see
where
those
men
went
said
lenore
and
forthwith
she
stepped
down
to
the
path
then
jake
deliberately
leaned
his
rifle
against
a
post
and
laying
hold
of
her
with
no
gentle
hands
he
swung
her
in
one
motion
back
upon
the
porch
the
broad
light
streaming
out
of
the
open
door
showed
that
whatever
his
force
meant
it
had
paled
his
face
to
exercise
it
why
jake
to
handle
me
that
way
cried
lenore
in
pretended
reproach
she
meant
to
frighten
or
coax
the
truth
out
of
him
you
hurt
me
i
beggin
your
pardon
if
i
was
rough
said
jake
fact
is
i
a
little
upset
an
i
mean
bizness
whereupon
lenore
stepped
back
to
close
the
door
and
then
in
the
shadow
she
returned
to
jake
and
whispered
i
was
only
in
fun
i
would
not
think
of
disobeying
you
but
you
can
trust
me
i
not
tell
and
i
worry
less
if
i
know
what
what
jake
is
father
in
danger
i
reckon
but
the
best
we
could
do
was
to
make
him
stand
fer
a
guard
there
four
of
us
cowpunchers
with
him
all
day
an
at
night
surrounded
by
guards
there
ai
much
chance
of
his
gittin
hurt
so
you
need
worry
about
thet
who
are
these
men
i
heard
passing
where
are
they
from
farmers
ranchers
cowboys
from
all
over
this
side
of
the
river
there
must
have
been
a
lot
of
them
said
lenore
curiously
reckon
you
never
heerd
the
quarter
of
what
come
to
attend
meetin
what
for
tell
me
jake
the
cowboy
hesitated
lenore
heard
his
big
hand
slap
round
the
we
orders
not
to
tell
thet
he
replied
but
jake
you
can
tell
you
always
tell
me
secrets
i
not
breathe
it
jake
came
closer
to
her
and
his
tall
head
reached
to
a
level
with
hers
where
she
stood
on
the
porch
lenore
saw
his
dark
set
face
his
gleaming
eyes
wal
it
jest
this
here
he
whispered
hoarsely
your
dad
has
organized
vigilantes
like
he
belonged
to
in
the
early
days
an
the
vigilantes
thet
will
attend
to
this
outfit
those
were
thrilling
words
to
jake
as
was
attested
by
his
emotion
and
they
surely
made
lenore
knees
knock
together
she
had
heard
many
stories
from
her
father
of
that
famous
old
vigilante
band
secret
making
the
law
where
there
was
no
law
oh
i
might
have
expected
that
of
dad
she
murmured
wal
it
sure
the
trick
out
here
an
your
father
the
man
to
deal
it
there
be
little
wheat
burned
in
this
valley
you
can
gamble
on
thet
i
glad
i
hate
the
very
thought
jake
you
know
about
misfortune
no
i
ai
heerd
about
him
but
i
knowed
the
bend
was
burnin
over
an
of
course
i
reckoned
dorn
would
lose
his
wheat
fact
is
he
had
the
only
wheat
up
there
worth
savin
wal
these
an
their
german
bosses
hev
put
it
all
over
the
early
days
when
rustlin
cattle
holdin
up
an
jest
plain
cussedness
was
stylish
jake
i
rather
have
lived
back
in
the
early
days
mused
lenore
me
too
though
i
ai
no
youngster
he
replied
reckon
you
better
go
in
now
miss
lenore
do
you
worry
none
or
lose
any
sleep
lenore
bade
the
cowboy
and
went
to
the
her
mother
sat
preoccupied
with
sad
and
thoughtful
face
rose
was
writing
many
pages
to
jim
kathleen
sat
at
the
table
surreptitiously
eating
while
she
was
pretending
to
read
my
but
you
look
funny
lenorry
she
cried
why
do
you
laugh
then
retorted
lenore
you
white
your
eyes
are
big
and
purple
you
look
like
a
starved
cannibal
if
that
what
it
like
to
be
in
love
excuse
me
never
fall
for
any
man
you
ought
to
be
in
bed
mother

recommend

baby

the
family

yes
child
it
long
past
your
bedtime
said
anderson
aw
no
wailed
kathleen
yes
ordered
her
mother
but
you
never
thought
of
it
if
lenorry
had
said
so
replied
kathleen
you
should
obey
lenore
reprovingly
said
anderson
what
me
mind
her
burst
out
kathleen
hotly
as
she
got
up
to
go
well
i
guess
not
kathleen
backed
to
the
door
and
opened
it
then
making
a
frightful
face
at
lenore
most
expressive
of
ridicule
and
revenge
she
darted
my
dear
will
you
write
to
your
brother
inquired
anderson
yes
replied
lenore
i
send
mine
with
rose
anderson
bade
the
girls
and
left
the
room
after
that
nothing
was
heard
for
a
while
except
the
scratching
of
pens
it
was
late
when
lenore
retired
yet
she
found
sleep
elusive
the
evening
had
made
subtle
indefinable
changes
in
her
she
went
over
in
mind
all
that
had
been
said
to
her
and
which
she
felt
with
the
result
that
one
thing
remained
to
torment
and
perplex
and
thrill
her
to
keep
kurt
dorn
from
going
to
war
next
day
lenore
did
not
go
out
to
the
harvest
fields
she
expected
dorn
might
arrive
at
any
time
and
she
wanted
to
be
there
when
he
came
yet
she
dreaded
the
meeting
she
had
to
keep
her
hands
active
that
day
so
in
some
measure
to
control
her
mind
a
thousand
times
she
felt
herself
on
the
verge
of
thrilling
and
flushing
her
fancy
and
imagination
seemed
wonderfully
active
the
day
was
more
than
usually
golden
crowned
with
an
azure
blue
like
the
blue
of
the
pacific
she
worked
in
her
room
helped
her
mother
took
up
her
knitting
and
sewed
upon
a
dress
and
even
lent
a
hand
in
the
kitchen
but
action
could
not
wholly
dull
the
song
in
her
heart
she
felt
unutterably
young
as
if
life
had
just
opened
with
haunting
limitless
beautiful
possibilities
never
had
the
been
so
sweet
anderson
came
in
early
from
the
fields
that
day
he
looked
like
a
with
his
sweaty
shirt
his
dusty
coat
his
begrimed
face
and
when
he
kissed
lenore
he
left
a
great
smear
on
her
cheek
that
a
harvest
kiss
my
lass
he
said
with
his
big
laugh
best
of
the
whole
year
it
sure
is
dad
she
replied
but
i
wait
till
you
wash
your
face
before
i
return
it
how
the
harvest
going
we
had
trouble
he
said
what
happened
nothin
much
but
it
was
annoyin
we
had
some
machines
crippled
it
took
most
of
the
day
to
fix
them
we
got
a
couple
of
hundred
hands
at
work
some
of
them
are
that
sure
but
they
all
swear
they
are
not
an
we
have
no
way
to
prove
it
an
we
could
catch
them
at
their
tricks
all
the
same
we
got
half
your
big
cut
a
thousand
acres
lenore
some
of
the
wheat
go
forty
bushels
to
the
acre
but
mostly
under
that
better
than
last
harvest
lenore
replied
gladly
we
are
lucky
father
did
you
hear
any
news
from
the
bend

he
replied
and
patted
her
head
they
sent
me
a
message
up
from
vale
young
dorn
wired
from
kilo

be
here
echoed
lenore
and
her
heart
showed
a
tendency
to
act
strangely
yep

said
anderson
cheerfully
tell
your
mother
mebbe

for
supper

room

replied
lenore
wal

regular
farmer
girl

sure
huggable

jake

no
trouble

him
how

exclaimed
lenore
with
burning
cheeks
she
ran
to
her
room
and
made
haste
to
change
her
dress
but
dorn
did
not
arrive
in
time
for
supper
eight
came
without
his
appearing
after
which
with
keen
disappointment
lenore
gave
up
expecting
him
that
night
she
was
in
her
father
study
helping
him
with
the
harvest
notes
and
figures
when
jake
knocked
and
entered
dorn
here
he
announced
good
fetch
him
in
replied
anderson
father
i
i
rather

whispered
lenore
you
stay
right
along
by
your
dad
was
his
reply
an
be
a
real
anderson
when
lenore
heard
dorn
step
in
the
hall
the
fluttering
ceased
in
her
heart
and
she
grew
calm
how
glad
she
would
be
to
see
him
it
had
been
the
suspense
of
waiting
that
had
played
havoc
with
her
feelings
then
dorn
entered
with
jake
the
cowboy
set
down
a
bag
and
went
out
he
seemed
strange
to
lenore
and
very
handsome
in
his
gray
flannel
suit
as
he
stepped
forward
in
greeting
lenore
saw
how
white
he
was
how
tragic
his
eyes
there
had
come
a
subtle
change
in
his
face
it
hurt
her
miss
anderson
i
glad
to
see
you
he
said
and
a
flash
of
red
stained
his
white
cheeks
how
are
you
very
well
thank
you
she
replied
offering
her
hand
i
glad
to
see
you
they
shook
hands
while
anderson
boomed
out
hello
son
i
sure
am
glad
to
welcome
you
to
waters
no
doubt
as
to
the
rancher
warm
and
hearty
greeting
it
warmed
some
of
the
coldness
out
of
dorn
face
thank
you
it
good
to
come
yet
it
it
hard
lenore
saw
his
throat
swell
his
voice
seemed
low
and
full
of
emotion
bad
news
to
tell
said
anderson
wal
forget
it
have
you
had
supper
yes
at
huntington
i
have
been
here
sooner
but
we
punctured
a
tire
my
driver
said
the
was
breaking
bottles
on
the
roads
now
where
i
ever
hear
that
name
asked
anderson
quizzically
bustin
bottles
hey
wal
they
be
bustin
their
heads
presently
sit
down
dorn
you
look
fine
only
you
sure
pale
i
lost
my
father
said
dorn
what
your
old
man
dead
aw
that
tough
lenore
felt
an
almost
uncontrollable
impulse
to
go
to
dorn
oh
sorry
she
said
that
is
a
surprise
went
on
anderson
rather
huskily
my
lord
but
it
only
round
the
corner
for
every
man
come
on
tell
us
all
about
it
an
the
rest
of
the
bad
news
get
it
over
then
mebbe
lenore
me
but
anderson
did
not
conclude
his
last
sentence
dorn
face
began
to
work
as
he
began
to
talk
and
his
eyes
were
dark
and
deep
burning
with
gloom
bad
news
it
is
indeed
anderson
the
marked
us
you
remember
your
suggestion
about
getting
my
neighbors
to
harvest
our
wheat
in
a
rush
i
went
all
over
and
almost
all
of
them
came
we
had
been
finding
phosphorus
everywhere
then
on
the
hot
day
fires
broke
out
all
around
my
neighbors
left
their
own
burning
fields
to
save
ours
we
fought
fire
we
fought
fire
all
around
us
late
into
the
night
my
father
had
grown
furious
maddened
at
the
discovery
of
how
he
had
been
betrayed
by
glidden
you
remember
the
the
plot
in
which
some
way
my
father
was
involved
he
would
not
believe
the
meant
to
burn
wheat
and
when
the
fires
broke
out
he
worked
like
a
it
killed
him
i
was
not
with
him
when
he
died
but
jerry
our
foreman
was
and
my
father
last
words
were
my
son
i
was
thank
god
he
sent
me
that
message
i
think
in
that
he
confessed
the
iniquity
of
the
germans
well
my
neighbor
olsen
managed
the
harvest
he
sure
rushed
it
i
have
given
a
good
deal
for
you
and
miss
anderson
to
have
seen
all
those
big
combines
at
work
on
one
field
it
was
great
we
harvested
over
thousand
bushels
and
got
all
the
wheat
safely
to
the
elevators
at
the
station
and
that
night
the
burned
the
elevators
anderson
face
turned
purple
he
appeared
about
to
explode
there
was
a
deep
rumbling
within
his
throat
that
lenore
knew
to
be
profanity
restrained
on
account
of
her
presence
as
for
her
own
feelings
they
were
a
strange
mixture
of
sadness
for
dorn
and
pride
in
her
fury
and
something
unutterably
sweet
in
the
revelation
about
to
be
made
to
this
unfortunate
boy
but
she
could
not
speak
a
word
just
then
and
it
appeared
that
her
father
was
in
the
same
state
evidently
the
telling
of
his
story
had
relieved
dorn
the
strain
relaxed
in
his
white
face
and
it
lost
a
little
of
its
stern
fixity
he
got
up
and
opening
his
bag
he
took
out
some
papers
anderson
i
like
to
settle
all
this
right
now
he
said
i
want
it
off
my
mind
go
ahead
son
an
settle
replied
anderson
thickly
he
heaved
a
big
sigh
and
then
sat
down
fumbling
for
a
match
to
light
his
cigar
when
he
got
it
lighted
he
drew
in
a
big
breath
and
with
it
manifestly
a
great
draught
of
consoling
smoke
i
want
to
make
over
the
the
land
in
fact
all
the
property
to
you
to
settle
mortgage
and
interest
went
on
dorn
earnestly
and
then
paused
all
right
i
expected
that
returned
anderson
as
he
emitted
a
cloud
of
smoke
the
only
thing
is
here
dorn
hesitated
evidently
with
difficult
speech
the
property
is
worth
more
than
the
debt
sure
i
know
said
anderson
encouragingly
i
promised
our
neighbors
big
money
to
harvest
our
wheat
you
remember
you
told
me
to
offer
it
well
they
left
their
own
wheat
and
barley
fields
to
burn
and
they
saved
ours
and
then
they
harvested
it
and
hauled
it
to
the
railroad
i
owe
andrew
olsen
fifteen
thousand
dollars
for
himself
and
the
men
who
worked
with
him
if
i
could
pay
that
i
almost
be
happy
do
you
think
my
property
is
worth
that
much
more
than
the
debt
i
think
it
is
just
about
replied
anderson
we
mail
the
money
to
olsen
lenore
write
out
a
check
to
andrew
olsen
for
fifteen
thousand
lenore
hand
trembled
as
she
did
as
her
father
directed
it
was
the
most
poorly
written
check
she
had
ever
drawn
her
heart
seemed
too
big
for
her
breast
just
then
how
cool
and
calm
her
father
was
never
had
she
loved
him
quite
so
well
as
then
when
she
looked
up
from
her
task
it
was
to
see
a
change
in
kurt
dorn
that
suddenly
dimmed
her
eyes
there
send
this
to
olsen
said
anderson
we
run
into
town
in
a
day
or
so
an
file
the
papers
lenore
had
to
turn
her
gaze
away
from
dorn
she
heard
him
in
broken
husky
accents
try
to
express
his
gratitude
sure
sure
interrupted
anderson
hastily
now
listen
to
me
things
ai
so
bad
as
they
look
for
instance
we
goin
to
fool
the
down
here
in
the
valley

so

saw
hundreds
of
men
between
her
and
kilo

anderson

replied
dorn
grimly
wal
i
reckon
we
need

round
here
powerful
much
said
the
rancher
dryly
dorn
i
got
a
big
proposition
to
put
up
to
you
lenore
thrilling
at
her
father
words
turned
once
more
dorn
appeared
more
composed

you
he
inquired
in
surprise
sure
but
there
no
hurry
about
tellin
you
suppose
we
put
it
off
i
rather
hear
it
now
my
stay
here

be
short
i
i

wal
then
it
this
will

work
that
bend
of
yours
for
me
on
half
shares
more
particular
i
want
you
to
take
charge
of
waters
you
see
i
not
so
spry
as
i
used
to
be
it
a
big
job
an
i
a
lot
of
confidence
in
you
you
live
here
of
course
an
run
to
fro
with
one
of
my
cars
i
some
schemes
an
to
cut
it
short
there
a
big
place
waitin
for
you
in
the
northwest
mr
anderson
cried
dorn
in
a
kind
of
rapturous
amaze
red
burned
out
the
white
of
his
face
that
great
it
too
great
to
come
true
you
good
if
i
lucky
enough
to
come
back
from
the
war
son
you
not
goin
to
war
interposed
anderson
what
exclaimed
dorn
blankly
he
stared
as
if
he
had
not
heard
aright
anderson
calmly
repeated
his
assertion
he
was
smiling
he
looked
kind
but
underneath
that
showed
the
will
that
had
made
him
what
he
was
but
i
flashed
the
young
man
as
if
he
had
been
misunderstood
listen
you
like
all
boys
an
hasty
let
me
talk
a
little
resumed
anderson
and
he
began
to
speak
of
the
future
of
the
northwest
he
painted
that
in
the
straight
talk
of
a
farmer
who
knew
but
what
he
predicted
seemed
like
a
then
he
passed
to
the
needs
of
the
government
and
the
armies
and
lastly
the
people
of
the
nation
all
depended
upon
the
farmer
wheat
was
indeed
the
staff
of
life
and
of
victory
young
dorn
was
one
of
the
farmers
who
could
not
be
spared
patriotism
was
a
noble
thing
fighting
however
did
not
alone
constitute
a
duty
and
loyalty
to
the
nation
this
was
an
economic
war
a
war
of
peoples
and
the
nation
that
was
the
best
fed
would
last
longest
adventure
and
the
mistaken
romance
of
war
called
indeed
to
all
young
americans
it
was
good
that
they
did
call
but
they
should
not
call
the
young
farmer
from
his
but
i
been
drafted
dorn
spoke
with
agitation
he
seemed
bewildered
by
anderson
blunt
eloquence
his
intelligence
evidently
accepted
the
elder
man
argument
but
something
instinctive
revolted
there
exemption
my
boy
easy
in
your
case
replied
anderson
exemption
echoed
dorn
and
a
dark
tide
of
blood
rose
to
his
temples
i
would
i
could
ask
for
that
you
do
need
to
said
the
rancher
dorn
do
you
recollect
that
washington
official
who
called
on
you
some
time
ago
yes
replied
dorn
slowly
did
he
say
anythin
about
exemption
no
he
asked
me
if
i
wanted
it
that
all
wal
you
had
it
right
then
i
took
it
upon
myself
to
get
exemption
for
you
that
government
official
heartily
approved
of
my
exemption
for
you
an
he
gave
it
anderson
you
took
it
upon
yourself
gasped
dorn
slowly
rising
if
he
had
been
before
he
was
ghastly
now
sure
i
did
good
lord
dorn
do
imagine
i
ever
questioned
your
nerve
it
only
you
not
needed
or
rather
you
needed
more
at
home
i
let
my
son
jim
go
to
war
that
enough
for
one
family
but
dorn
did
not
grasp
the
significance
of
anderson
reply
how
dared
you
what
right
had
you
he
demanded
passionately
no
right
at
all
lad
replied
anderson
i
just
recommended
it
an
the
official
approved
it
but
i
refuse
cried
dorn
with
ringing
fury
i
wo
accept
exemption
talk
sense
now
even
if
you
are
mad
returned
anderson
rising
paid
you
a
high
compliment
young
man
an
offered
you
a
lot
more
you
see
i
guess
why
wo
you
accept
exemption
i
going
to
war
was
the
grim
hard
reply
but
you
needed
here
you
be
more
of
a
soldier
here
you
could
do
more
for
your
country
than
if
you
gave
a
hundred
lives
ca
you
see
that
yes
i
can
assented
dorn
as
if
forced
you
no
fool
an
you
a
loyal
american
your
duty
is
to
stay
home
an
raise
wheat
i
a
duty
to
myself
returned
dorn
darkly
son
your
fortune
stares
you
right
in
the
face
here
are
you
goin
to
turn
from
it
yes
you
want
to
get
in
that
war
you
got
to
fight
yes
anderson
threw
up
his
hands
in
surrender
got
to
kill
some
germans
hey
why
not
come
out
to
my
harvest
fields
an
a
few
of
them
german
dorn
had
no
reply
for
that
wal
i
sorry
resumed
anderson
i
see
it
a
tough
place
for
you
though
i
ca
understand
you
excuse
me
for
mixin
in
your
affairs
an
now
considerin
other
ways
i
really
helped
you
i
hope
you
stay
at
my
home
for
a
few
days
we
all
owe
you
a
good
deal
my
family
wants
to
make
up
to
you
will
you
stay
thank
you
yes
for
a
few
days
replied
dorn
good
that
help
some
mebbe
after
runnin
around
waters
with
le
with
the
girls
you
begin
to
be
reasonable
i
hope
so
you
think
me
ungrateful
exclaimed
dorn
shrinking
i
do
think
nothin
replied
anderson
i
turn
you
over
to
lenore
he
laughed
as
he
pronounced
dorn
utter
defeat
and
his
look
at
lenore
was
equivalent
to
saying
the
issue
now
depended
upon
her
and
that
he
had
absolutely
no
doubt
of
its
outcome
lenore
take
him
in
to
meet
mother
an
the
girls
an
entertain
him
i
got
work
to
do
lenore
felt
the
blushes
in
her
cheeks
and
was
glad
dorn
did
not
look
at
her
he
seemed
locked
in
somber
thought
as
she
touched
him
and
bade
him
come
he
gave
a
start
then
he
followed
her
into
the
hall
lenore
closed
her
father
door
and
the
instant
she
stood
alone
with
dorn
a
wonderful
calmness
came
to
her
miss
anderson
i
rather
not
not
meet
your
mother
and
sisters
said
dorn
i
upset
wo
it
be
all
right
to
wait
till
surely
but
i
think
they
gone
to
bed
replied
lenore
as
she
glanced
into
the
dark
so
they
have
come
let
us
go
into
the
parlor
lenore
turned
on
the
shaded
lights
in
the
beautiful
room
how
inexplicable
was
the
feeling
of
being
alone
with
him
yet
utterly
free
of
the
torment
that
had
possessed
her
before
she
seemed
to
have
divined
an
almost
insurmountable
obstacle
in
dorn
will
she
did
not
have
her
father
assurance
it
made
her
tremble
to
realize
her
responsibility
that
her
father
earnest
wishes
and
her
future
of
love
or
woe
depended
entirely
upon
what
she
said
and
did
but
she
felt
that
indeed
she
had
become
a
woman
and
it
would
take
a
woman
wit
and
charm
and
love
to
change
this
tragic
boy
miss
anderson
he
began
brokenly
with
restraint
let
down
your
father
does
understand
i
to
go
and
even
if
i
am
spared
i
could
ever
come
back
to
work
for
him
all
the
time
in
love
with
you
i
could
stand
it
he
so
good
i
know
i
could
care
for
him
too
oh
i
thought
i
was
bitterly
resigned
hard
inhuman
but
all
this
makes
it
so
so
much
worse
he
sat
down
heavily
and
completely
unnerved
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
his
shoulders
heaved
and
short
strangled
sobs
broke
from
him
lenore
had
to
overcome
a
rush
of
tenderness
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
keep
from
dropping
to
her
knees
beside
him
and
slipping
her
arms
around
his
neck
in
her
agitation
she
could
not
decide
whether
that
would
be
womanly
or
not
only
she
must
make
no
mistakes
a
hot
sweet
flush
went
over
her
when
she
thought
that
always
as
a
last
resort
she
could
reveal
her
secret
and
use
her
power
what
would
he
do
when
he
discovered
she
loved
him
kurt
i
understand
she
said
softly
and
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
she
stood
thus
beside
him
sadly
troubled
vaguely
divining
that
her
presence
was
helpful
until
he
recovered
his
composure
as
he
raised
his
head
and
wiped
tears
from
his
eyes
he
made
no
excuses
for
his
weakness
nor
did
he
show
any
shame
miss
anderson
he
began
please
call
me
lenore
i
feel
so
so
stiff
when
you
are
formal
my
friends
call
me
lenore
she
said
you
mean
you
consider
me
your
friend
he
queried
indeed
i
do
she
replied
smiling
i
i
afraid
i
misunderstood
your
asking
me
to
visit
you
he
said
i
thank
you
i
proud
and
glad
that
you
call
me
your
friend
it
will
be
splendid
to
remember
when
i
am
over
there
i
wonder
if
we
could
talk
of
anything
except
trouble
and
war
replied
lenore
plaintively
if
we
ca
then
let
look
at
the
bright
side
is
there
a
bright
side
he
asked
with
his
sad
smile
every
cloud
you
know
for
instance
if
you
go
to
war
not
if
i
going
he
interrupted
oh
so
you
say
returned
lenore
softly
and
she
felt
deep
in
her
the
inception
of
a
tremendous
feminine
antagonism
it
stirred
along
her
pulse
have
your
own
way
then
but
say
you
go
think
how
fine
it
will
be
for
me
to
get
letters
from
you
at
the
front
and
to
write
you
you
like
to
hear
from
me
you
would
answer
he
asked
breathlessly
assuredly
and
i
knit
socks
for
you
you
very
good
he
said
with
strong
feeling
lenore
again
saw
his
eyes
dim
how
strangely
sensitive
he
was
if
he
exaggerated
such
a
little
kindness
as
she
had
suggested
if
he
responded
to
it
with
such
emotion
what
would
he
do
when
the
great
and
marvelous
truth
of
her
love
was
flung
in
his
face
the
very
thought
made
lenore
weak
you
go
to
went
on
lenore
and
because
of
your
wonderful
physique
and
your
intelligence
you
will
get
a
commission
then
you
go
to
france
lenore
faltered
a
little
in
her
imagined
prospect
you
be
in
the
thick
of
the
great
battles
you
give
and
take
you
kill
some
of
those
those
germans
you
be
wounded
and
you
be
promoted
then
the
allies
will
win
uncle
sam
grand
army
will
have
saved
the
world
glorious
you
come
back
home
to
us
to
take
the
place
dad
offered
you
there
that
is
the
bright
side
indeed
the
brightness
seemed
reflected
in
dorn
face
i
never
dreamed
you
could
be
like
this
he
said
wonderingly
like
what
i
do
know
just
what
i
mean
only
you
different
from
my
my
fancies
not
cold
or
or
proud
you
beginning
to
get
acquainted
with
me
that
all
after
been
here
awhile
please
do
make
it
so
hard
for
me
he
interrupted
appealingly
i
ca
stay
do
you
want
to
she
asked
yes
and
i
will
stay
a
couple
of
days
but
no
longer
it
be
hard
enough
to
go
then
perhaps
i
we
make
it
so
hard
for
you
that
you
ca
go
then
he
gazed
piercingly
at
her
as
if
realizing
a
will
opposed
to
his
a
conviction
not
in
sympathy
with
his
you
going
to
keep
this
up
this
trying
to
change
my
mind
i
surely
am
she
replied
both
wistfully
and
wilfully
why
i
should
think
you
respect
my
sense
of
duty
your
duty
is
more
here
than
at
the
front
the
government
man
said
so
my
father
believes
it
so
do
i
you
have
some
other
other
thing
you
think
duty
i
hate
germans
he
burst
out
with
a
dark
and
terrible
flash
who
does
not
she
flashed
back
at
him
and
she
rose
feeling
as
if
drawn
by
a
powerful
current
she
realized
then
that
she
must
be
prepared
any
moment
to
be
overwhelmed
by
the
inevitable
climax
of
this
meeting
but
she
prayed
for
a
little
more
time
she
fought
her
emotions
she
saw
him
tremble
lenore
i
better
run
off
in
the
night
he
said
instinctively
with
swift
soft
violence
she
grasped
his
hands
perhaps
the
moment
had
come
she
was
not
afraid
but
the
suddenness
of
her
extremity
left
her
witless
you
would
not
that
would
be
unkind
not
like
you
at
all
to
run
off
without
giving
me
a
chance
without
promise
me
you
will
not
i
promise
he
replied
wearily
as
if
nonplussed
by
her
attitude
you
said
you
understood
me
but
i
ca
understand
you
she
released
his
hands
and
turned
away
i
promise
that
you
shall
understand
very
soon
you
feel
sorry
for
me
you
pity
me
you
think
i
only
be
for
the
germans
you
want
to
be
nice
kind
sweet
to
me
to
send
me
away
with
better
thoughts
is
that
what
you
think
he
was
impatient
almost
angry
his
glance
blazed
at
her
all
about
him
his
tragic
face
his
sadness
his
defeat
his
struggle
to
hold
on
to
his
manliness
and
to
keep
his
faith
in
nobler
thoughts
these
challenged
lenore
compassion
her
love
and
her
woman
combative
spirit
to
save
and
to
keep
her
own
she
quivered
again
on
the
brink
of
betraying
herself
and
it
was
panic
alone
that
held
her
back
kurt
i
think
presently
i
give
you
the
surprise
of
your
life
she
replied
and
summoned
a
smile
how
obtuse
he
was
how
blind
perhaps
the
stress
of
his
emotion
the
terrible
sense
of
his
fate
left
him
no
keenness
no
outward
penetration
he
answered
her
smile
as
if
she
were
a
child
whose
determined
kindness
made
him
both
happy
and
sad
i
dare
say
you
will
he
replied
you
andersons
are
full
of
surprises
but
i
wish
you
would
not
do
any
more
for
me
i
am
like
a
dog
the
kinder
you
are
to
me
the
more
i
love
you
how
dreadful
to
go
away
to
war
to
violence
and
blood
and
death
to
all
brutalizing
with
my
heart
and
mind
full
of
love
for
a
noble
girl
like
you
if
i
come
to
love
you
any
more
i
not
be
a
man
to
lenore
he
looked
very
much
of
a
man
so
tall
and
lithe
and
with
his
eyes
of
fire
his
simplicity
and
his
tragic
refusal
of
all
that
was
for
most
men
the
best
of
life
whatever
his
ideal
it
was
magnificent
lenore
had
her
chance
then
but
she
was
absolutely
unable
to
grasp
it
her
blood
beat
thick
and
hot
if
she
could
only
have
been
sure
of
herself
or
was
it
that
she
still
cared
too
much
for
herself
the
moment
had
not
come
and
in
her
tumult
there
was
a
fleeting
fury
at
dorn
blindness
at
his
reverence
of
her
that
he
dare
not
touch
her
hand
did
he
imagine
she
was
stone
let
us
say
good
night
she
said
you
are
worn
out
and
i
am
not
just
myself
we
be
good
friends
father
will
take
you
to
your
room
dorn
pressed
the
hand
she
offered
and
saying
he
followed
her
to
the
hall
lenore
tapped
on
the
door
of
her
father
study
then
opened
it
good
night
dad
i
going
up
she
said
will
you
look
after
kurt
sure
come
in
son
replied
her
father
lenore
felt
dorn
strange
intent
gaze
upon
her
as
she
passed
him
lightly
she
ran
and
turned
at
the
top
the
hall
was
bright
and
dorn
stood
full
in
the
light
his
face
upturned
it
still
wore
the
softer
expression
of
those
last
few
moments
lenore
waved
her
hand
and
he
smiled
the
moment
was
natural
youth
to
youth
lenore
felt
it
she
marveled
that
he
did
not
a
sweet
devil
of
wilful
coquetry
possessed
her
oh
did
you
say
you
would
go
she
softly
called
i
said
only
good
night
he
replied
if
you
go
then
you
will
never
be
general
dorn
will
you
what
a
pity
i
go
and
then
it
will
be
dorn
missing
no
relatives
he
replied
that
froze
lenore
her
heart
quaked
she
gazed
down
upon
him
with
all
her
soul
in
her
eyes
she
knew
it
and
did
not
care
but
he
could
not
see
good
night
kurt
dorn
she
called
and
ran
to
her
room
composure
did
not
come
to
her
until
she
was
ready
for
bed
with
the
light
out
and
in
her
old
seat
at
the
window
night
and
silence
and
starlight
always
lent
lenore
strength
she
prayed
to
them
now
and
to
the
spirit
she
knew
dwelt
beyond
them
and
then
she
whispered
what
her
intelligence
told
her
was
an
unalterable
fact
kurt
dorn
could
never
be
changed
but
her
sympathy
and
love
and
passion
all
that
was
womanly
emotion
stormed
at
her
intelligence
and
refused
to
listen
to
it
nothing
short
of
a
great
shock
would
divert
dorn
from
his
tragic
headlong
rush
toward
the
fate
he
believed
unalterable
lenore
sensed
a
terrible
sinister
earnestness
in
him
she
could
not
divine
its
meaning
but
it
was
such
a
driving
passion
that
no
man
possessing
it
and
free
to
the
violence
of
war
could
ever
escape
death
even
if
by
superhuman
strife
and
the
guidance
of
providence
he
did
escape
death
he
would
have
lost
something
as
precious
as
life
if
dorn
went
to
war
at
all
if
he
ever
reached
those
trenches
in
the
thick
of
fire
and
shriek
and
ferocity
there
to
express
in
horrible
earnestness
what
she
vaguely
felt
yet
could
not
define
then
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
she
imagined
that
she
would
not
want
him
to
come
back
that
was
the
strength
of
spirit
that
breathed
out
of
the
night
and
the
silence
to
her
dorn
would
go
to
war
as
no
ordinary
soldier
to
obey
to
fight
to
do
his
duty
but
for
some
strange
unfathomable
obsession
of
his
own
and
therefore
if
he
went
at
all
he
was
lost
war
in
its
inexplicable
horror
killed
the
souls
of
endless
hordes
of
men
therefore
if
he
went
at
all
she
too
was
lost
to
the
happiness
that
might
have
been
hers
she
would
never
love
another
man
she
could
never
marry
she
would
never
have
a
child
so
his
soul
and
her
happiness
were
in
the
balance
weighed
against
a
woman
power
it
seemed
to
lenore
that
she
felt
hopelessly
unable
to
carry
the
issue
to
victory
and
yet
on
the
other
hand
a
tumultuous
and
wonderful
sweetness
of
sensation
called
to
her
insidiously
of
the
infallible
potency
of
love
what
could
she
do
to
save
dorn
life
and
his
soul
there
was
only
one
answer
to
that
she
would
do
anything
she
must
make
him
love
her
to
the
extent
that
he
would
have
no
will
to
carry
out
this
desperate
intent
there
was
little
time
to
do
that
the
gradual
growth
of
affection
through
intimacy
and
understanding
was
not
possible
here
it
must
come
as
a
flash
of
lightning
she
must
bewilder
him
with
the
revelation
of
her
love
and
then
by
all
its
incalculable
power
hold
him
there
it
was
her
father
wish
it
would
be
the
salvation
of
dorn
it
meant
all
to
her
but
if
to
keep
him
there
would
make
him
a
slacker
lenore
swore
she
would
die
before
lifting
her
lips
to
his
the
government
would
rather
he
stayed
to
raise
wheat
than
go
out
and
fight
men
lenore
saw
the
sanity
the
cardinal
importance
of
that
as
her
father
saw
it
so
from
all
sides
she
was
justified
and
sitting
there
in
the
darkness
and
silence
with
the
cool
wind
in
her
face
she
vowed
she
would
be
all
woman
all
sweetness
all
love
all
passion
all
that
was
feminine
and
terrible
to
keep
dorn
from
going
to
war
chapter
xix
lenore
awakened
early
the
morning
seemed
golden
birds
were
singing
at
her
window
what
did
that
day
hold
in
store
for
her
she
pressed
a
hand
hard
on
her
heart
as
if
to
hold
it
still
but
her
heart
went
right
on
swift
exultant
throbbing
with
a
fullness
that
was
almost
pain
early
as
she
awakened
it
was
nevertheless
late
when
she
could
direct
her
reluctant
steps
she
had
welcomed
every
little
suggestion
and
task
to
delay
the
facing
of
her
ordeal
there
was
merriment
in
the
and
dorn
laugh
made
her
glad
the
girls
were
at
him
and
her
father
pleasant
deep
voice
chimed
in
evidently
there
was
a
controversy
as
to
who
should
have
the
society
of
the
guest
they
had
all
been
to
breakfast
anderson
expressed
surprise
at
lenore
tardiness
and
said
she
had
been
called
twice
lenore
had
heard
nothing
except
the
birds
and
the
music
of
her
thoughts
she
peeped
into
the
did
you
bring
me
anything
kathleen
was
inquiring
of
dorn
dorn
was
flushed
and
smiling
anderson
stood
beaming
upon
them
and
rose
appeared
to
be
inclined
toward
jealousy
why
you
see
i
did
even
know
lenore
had
a
little
sister
dorn
explained
oh
exclaimed
kathleen
evidently
satisfied
all
lenorry
beaux
bring
me
things
but
i
believe
i
going
to
like
you
best
lenore
had
intended
to
say
good
morning
she
changed
her
mind
however
at
kathleen
naïve
speech
and
darted
back
lest
she
be
seen
she
felt
the
blood
hot
in
her
cheeks
that
awful
irrepressible
kathleen
if
she
liked
dorn
she
would
take
possession
of
him
and
kathleen
was
lovable
irresistible
lenore
had
a
sudden
thought
that
kathleen
would
aid
the
good
cause
if
she
could
be
enlisted
while
lenore
ate
her
breakfast
she
listened
to
the
animated
conversation
in
the
presently
her
father
came
in
hello
lenore
did
you
get
up
he
greeted
her
cheerily
i
hardly
ever
did
it
seems
dad
the
day
was
something
to
face
she
said
it
like
getting
up
to
work
lenore
the
biggest
duty
of
life
is
to
hide
your
troubles
dorn
looks
like
a
human
bein
this
mornin
the
kids
have
won
him
i
reckon
he
needs
that
sort
of
cheer
let
them
have
him
then
after
a
while
you
fetch
him
out
to
the
lenore
our
harvestin
is
half
done
every
day
i
expected
some
trick
or
deviltry
but
it
has
come
yet
are
any
of
the
other
ranchers
having
trouble
she
inquired
i
hear
rumors
of
bad
work
but
facts
told
by
ranchers
an
men
who
were
here
only
yesterday
make
little
of
the
rumors
all
that
burnin
of
wheat
an
timber
an
the
destruction
of
machines
an
strikin
of
have
hit
golden
valley
yet
we
wo
need
any
militia
here
you
can
bet
on
that
father
it
wo
do
to
be
she
said
earnestly
you
know
you
are
the
mark
for
the
sabotage
if
you
are
not
careful
any
moment
lenore
paused
with
a
shudder
lass
i
just
like
i
was
in
the
old
rustlin
days
an
i
surrounded
myself
with
cowboys
like
jake
an
bill
an
old
hands
who
pack
guns
keep
still
as
in
the
good
old
western
days
we
just
waitin
for
the
to
break
loose
then
what
queried
lenore
wal
we
chase
that
outfit
so
fast
it
be
lost
in
dust
he
replied
but
if
you
chase
them
away
it
only
be
into
another
state
where
they
make
trouble
for
other
farmers
you
do
do
any
real
good
my
dear
i
reckon
you
said
somethin
strong
he
replied
soberly
and
went
out
then
kathleen
came
bouncing
in
her
beautiful
eyes
were
full
of
mischief
and
excitement
lenorry
your
new
beau
has
all
the
others
skinned
to
a
frazzle
she
said
for
once
lenore
did
not
scold
kathleen
but
drew
her
close
and
whispered
do
you
want
to
please
me
do
you
want
me
to
do
for
you
i
sure
do
replied
kathleen
with
wonderful
eyes
then
be
nice
sweet
good
to
him
make
him
love
you
do
tease
him
about
my
other
beaux
think
how
you
can
make
him
like
waters
will
you
promise
whispered
kathleen
solemnly
evidently
lenore
promises
were
rare
and
reliable
yes
cross
my
heart
there
and
you
must
not
tell
kathleen
was
a
precocious
child
with
all
the
potentialities
of
youth
she
could
not
divine
lenore
motive
but
she
sensed
a
new
and
fascinating
mode
of
conduct
for
herself
she
seemed
puzzled
a
little
at
lenore
earnestness
it
a
bargain
she
said
soberly
as
if
she
had
accepted
no
slight
gauge
now
kathleen
take
him
all
over
the
gardens
the
orchards
the
corrals
and
barns
directed
lenore
be
sure
to
show
him
the
horses
my
horses
especially
take
him
round
the
reservoir
and
everywhere
except
the
i
want
to
take
him
there
myself
besides
father
does
not
want
you
girls
to
go
out
to
the
harvest
kathleen
nodded
and
ran
back
to
the
lenore
heard
them
all
go
out
together
before
she
finished
breakfast
her
mother
came
in
again
lenore
i
like
dorn
she
said
meditatively
he
has
an
manner
that
reminds
me
of
my
boy
friends
when
i
was
a
girl
i
mean
he
more
courteous
and
dignified
than
boys
are
nowadays
a
boy
too
only
his
face
is
so
sad
when
he
smiles
he
seems
another
person
no
wonder
he
sad
replied
lenore
and
briefly
told
kurt
story
ah
sighed
anderson
we
have
fallen
upon
evil
days
poor
boy
your
father
seems
much
interested
in
him
and
you
are
too
my
daughter
yes
i
am
replied
lenore
softly
two
hours
later
she
heard
kathleen
gay
laughter
and
pattering
feet
lenore
took
her
hat
and
went
out
on
the
porch
dorn
was
indeed
not
the
same
somber
young
man
he
had
been
good
morning
kurt
said
lenore
extending
her
hand
the
instant
he
greeted
her
she
saw
the
stiffness
the
aloofness
had
gone
from
him
kathleen
had
made
him
feel
at
home
he
looked
younger
there
was
color
in
his
face
kathleen
i
take
charge
of
dorn
now
if
you
will
allow
me
that
pleasure
lenorry
i
sure
hate
to
give
him
up
we
sure
had
a
fine
time
did
he
like
waters
well
if
he
did
he
a
grand
fibber
replied
kathleen
but
he
did
you
ca
fool
me
i
thought
i
never
get
him
back
to
the
house
then
as
she
tripped
up
the
porch
steps
she
shook
a
finger
at
dorn
remember
i
never
forget
said
dorn
and
he
was
as
earnest
as
he
was
amiable
then
as
she
disappeared
he
exclaimed
to
lenore
what
an
adorable
little
girl
do
you
like
kathleen
like
her
dorn
laughed
in
a
way
to
make
light
of
such
words
my
life
has
been
empty
i
see
that
come
we
go
out
to
the
said
lenore
what
do
you
think
of
waters
this
is
you
see
waters
at
its
very
best
i
can
hardly
tell
you
he
replied
all
my
life
i
lived
on
my
barren
hills
i
seem
to
have
come
to
another
world
waters
is
such
a
ranch
as
i
never
dreamed
of
the
orchards
the
fruit
the
gardens
and
everywhere
running
water
it
all
smells
so
fresh
and
sweet
and
then
the
green
and
red
and
purple
against
that
background
of
blazing
gold
waters
is
verdant
and
fruitful
the
bend
is
desert
now
that
you
been
here
do
you
like
it
better
than
your
barren
hills
asked
lenore
kurt
hesitated
i
do
know
he
answered
slowly
but
maybe
that
desert
i
lived
in
accounts
for
much
i
lack
would
you
like
to
stay
at
waters
if
you
were
going
to
war
i
might
prefer
waters
to
any
place
on
earth
it
a
paradise
but
i
would
not
chose
to
stay
here
why
when
you
return
you
know
my
father
will
need
you
here
and
if
anything
should
happen
to
him
i
will
have
to
run
the
ranch
then
would
need
you
dorn
stopped
in
his
tracks
and
gazed
at
her
as
if
there
were
slight
misgivings
in
his
mind
lenore
if
you
owned
this
ranch
would
you
want
me
for
your
manager
he
asked
bluntly
yes
she
replied
you
would
knowing
i
was
in
love
with
you
well
i
had
forgotten
that
she
replied
with
a
little
laugh
it
would
be
rather
embarrassing
and
funny
would
it
yes
it
would
he
said
grimly
and
walked
on
again
he
made
a
gesture
of
keen
discomfiture
i
knew
you
had
taken
me
seriously
i
believed
you
but
i
could
not
take
you
seriously
she
murmured
why
not
he
demanded
as
if
stung
and
his
eyes
flashed
on
her
because
your
declaration
was
not
accompanied
by
the
usual
question
that
a
girl
naturally
expects
under
such
circumstances
good
heaven
you
say
that
lenore
anderson
you
think
me
insincere
because
i
did
not
ask
you
to
marry
me
he
asserted
with
bitter
pathos
no
i
merely
said
you
were
not
serious
she
replied
it
was
fascination
to
torment
him
this
way
yet
it
hurt
her
too
she
was
playing
on
the
verge
of
a
precipice
not
afraid
of
a
misstep
but
glorying
in
the
prospect
of
a
leap
into
the
abyss
something
deep
and
strange
in
her
bade
her
make
him
show
her
how
much
he
loved
her
if
she
drove
him
to
desperation
she
would
reward
him
i
am
going
to
war
he
began
passionately
to
fight
for
you
and
your
sisters
i
am
ruined
the
only
noble
and
holy
feeling
left
to
me
that
i
can
have
with
me
in
the
dark
hours
is
my
love
for
you
if
you
do
not
believe
that
i
am
indeed
the
most
miserable
of
beggars
most
boys
going
to
the
front
leave
many
behind
whom
they
love
i
have
no
one
but
you
do
make
me
a
coward
i
believe
you
forgive
me
she
said
if
i
had
asked
you
to
marry
me
why
i
have
been
a
selfish
egotistical
fool
you
are
far
above
me
and
i
want
you
to
know
i
know
it
but
even
if
i
had
not
had
the
blood
i
have
even
if
i
had
been
prosperous
instead
of
ruined
i
never
have
asked
you
unless
i
came
back
whole
from
the
war
they
had
been
walking
out
the
lane
during
this
conversation
and
had
come
close
to
the
the
day
was
hot
but
pleasant
the
dry
wind
being
laden
with
harvest
odors
the
hum
of
the
machines
was
like
the
roar
in
a
if
you
go
to
war
and
come
back
whole
began
lenore
tantalizingly
she
meant
to
have
no
mercy
upon
him
it
was
incredible
how
blind
he
was
yet
how
glad
that
made
her
he
resembled
his
desert
hills
barren
of
many
little
things
but
rich
in
hidden
strength
heroic
of
mold
then
just
to
add
one
more
to
the
conquests
girls
love
i
propose
to
you
he
declared
banteringly
beware
boy
i
might
accept
you
she
exclaimed
his
play
was
he
could
not
be
gay
even
under
her
influence
please
do
jest
he
said
frowning
ca
we
talk
of
something
besides
love
and
war
they
seem
to
be
popular
just
now
she
replied
audaciously
anyway
all
fair
you
know
no
it
is
not
fair
he
returned
and
earnest
so
once
for
all
let
me
beg
of
you
do
jest
oh
i
know
you
sweet
you
full
of
so
many
wonderful
surprising
words
and
looks
i
ca
understand
you
but
i
beg
of
you
do
make
me
a
fool
well
if
you
pay
such
compliments
and
if
i
want
them
what
then
you
are
very
original
very
gallant
kurt
dorn
and
i
i
rather
like
you
i
get
angry
with
you
he
threatened
you
could
i
the
only
girl
you
going
to
leave
behind
and
if
you
got
angry
i
never
write
to
you
it
thrilled
lenore
and
wrung
her
heart
to
see
how
her
talk
affected
him
he
was
in
a
torment
he
believed
she
spoke
lightly
girlishly
to
tease
him
that
she
was
only
a
girl
and
just
a
little
proud
of
her
conquest
over
even
him
i
surrender
say
what
you
like
he
said
resignedly
i
stand
anything
just
to
get
your
letters
if
you
go
i
write
as
often
as
you
want
me
to
she
replied
with
that
they
emerged
upon
the
machines
and
engines
dotted
the
golden
slope
and
wherever
they
were
located
stood
towering
horses
and
men
and
wagons
were
strung
out
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
long
streams
of
chaff
and
dust
and
smoke
drifted
upward
lenore
there
trouble
in
the
very
air
said
dorn
look
she
saw
a
crowd
of
men
gathering
round
one
of
the
great
some
one
was
yelling
let
stay
away
from
trouble
replied
lenore
we
enough
of
our
own
i
going
over
there
declared
dorn
perhaps
you
better
wait
for
me
or
go
back
well
you
the
first
boy
who
ever
come
on
he
interrupted
with
grim
humor
i
rather
enjoy
your
seeing
me
break
loose
as
i
will
if
there
any
trickery
before
they
got
to
the
little
crowd
lenore
both
heard
and
saw
her
father
he
was
in
a
rage
and
not
aware
of
her
presence
jake
and
bill
the
cowboys
hovered
over
him
anderson
strode
to
and
fro
from
one
side
of
the
harvester
to
the
other
lenore
did
not
recognize
any
of
the
and
even
the
driver
was
new
to
her
they
were
not
a
typical
western
harvest
crew
that
was
certain
she
did
not
like
their
sullen
looks
and
dorn
muttered
imprecation
the
moment
he
neared
them
confirmed
her
own
opinion
anderson
foreman
stood
gesticulating
pale
and
anxious
of
face
no
i
do
hold
you
responsible
roared
the
rancher
but
i
want
action
i
want
to
know
why
this
machine
broke
down
it
was
in
perfect
workin
order
declared
the
foreman
i
do
know
why
it
broke
down
that
the
fourth
machine
in
two
days
no
accident
i
tell
you
shouted
anderson
then
he
espied
dorn
and
waved
a
grimy
hand
come
here
dorn
he
called
and
stepped
out
of
the
group
of
dusty
men
somethin
wrong
here
this
new
harvester
broke
down
it
a
mccormack
an
new
to
us
but
it
has
worked
great
an
i
jest
believe
it
been
tampered
with
do
you
know
these
mccormack
harvesters
yes
they
reliable
replied
dorn
wal
get
your
coat
off
an
see
what
been
done
to
this
one
dorn
took
off
his
coat
and
was
about
to
throw
it
down
when
lenore
held
out
her
hand
for
it
unhitch
the
horses
said
dorn
anderson
gave
this
order
which
was
complied
with
then
dorn
disappeared
around
or
under
the
big
machine
lenore
i
bet
he
tells
us
somethin
in
a
minute
said
anderson
to
her
these
new
claptraps
are
beyond
me
i
no
mechanic
dad
i
do
like
the
looks
of
your
whispered
lenore
wal
this
is
a
sample
of
the
lot
i
hired
no
society
for
you
my
lass
i
going
to
stay
now
she
replied
dorn
appeared
to
be
raising
a
racket
somewhere
out
of
sight
under
or
inside
the
huge
harvester
rattling
and
rasping
sounds
creaks
and
cracks
attested
to
his
strong
and
impatiently
seeking
hands
presently
he
appeared
his
white
shirt
had
been
soiled
by
dust
and
grease
there
was
chaff
in
his
fair
hair
in
one
grimy
hand
he
held
a
large
what
struck
lenore
most
was
the
piercing
intensity
of
his
gaze
as
he
fixed
it
upon
her
father
anderson
i
knew
right
where
to
find
it
he
said
in
a
sharp
hard
voice
this
was
thrown
upon
the
platform
carried
to
the
elevator
into
the
thresher
your
machine
is
torn
to
pieces
inside
out
of
commission
exclaimed
anderson
as
if
the
truth
was
a
great
relief
where
that
come
from
asked
the
foreman
aghast
not
ours
i
do
buy
that
kind
anderson
made
a
slight
significant
motion
to
the
cowboys
they
lined
up
beside
him
and
like
him
they
looked
dangerous
come
here
kurt
he
said
and
then
putting
lenore
before
him
he
moved
a
few
steps
aside
out
of
earshot
of
the
say
you
called
the
turn
right
off
did
you
anderson
i
had
a
hard
experience
all
in
one
replied
dorn
i
bet
you
i
can
find
out
who
threw
this
wrench
into
your
harvester
i
do
doubt
you
my
lad
but
how
it
had
to
be
thrown
by
one
of
these
men
near
the
machine
that
harvester
has
run
twenty
feet
from
where
the
trick
was
done
let
these
men
face
me
i
find
the
guilty
one
wait
till
we
get
lenore
out
of
the
way
replied
anderson
boss
me
an
bill
can
answer
fer
thet
outfit
as
it
stands
an
no
risks
fer
nobody
put
in
jake
coolly
anderson
reply
was
cut
short
by
a
loud
explosion
it
frightened
lenore
she
imagined
one
of
the
had
blown
up
that
thresher
on
fire
shouted
dorn
pointing
toward
a
big
machine
that
was
attached
by
an
endless
driving
belt
to
an
engine
the
workmen
uttering
yells
and
exclamations
ran
toward
the
scene
of
the
new
accident
leaving
anderson
his
daughter
and
the
foreman
behind
smoke
was
pouring
out
of
the
big
harvester
the
ran
wildly
around
shouting
and
calling
evidently
unable
to
do
anything
the
line
of
wagons
full
of
broke
up
men
dragged
at
the
plunging
horses
then
flame
followed
the
smoke
out
of
the
thresher
i
heard
of
threshers
catchin
fire
said
anderson
as
if
dumfounded
but
i
never
seen
one
now
how
on
earth
did
that
happen
another
trick
anderson
replied
dorn
some
has
stuffed
a
handful
of
matches
into
a
or
maybe
a
small
bomb
come
on
let
go
over
an
see
my
money
burn
up
kurt
i
gettin
some
new
education
these
days
dorn
appeared
to
be
unable
to
restrain
himself
he
hurried
on
ahead
of
the
others
and
anderson
whispered
to
lenore
i
bet
comin
off
this
alarmed
lenore
yet
it
also
thrilled
her
the
burned
like
a
house
of
cards
came
running
from
all
over
the
field
but
nothing
manifestly
could
be
done
to
save
the
thresher
anderson
holding
his
daughter
arm
calmly
watched
it
burn
there
was
excitement
all
around
it
had
not
been
communicated
however
to
the
rancher
he
looked
thoughtful
the
foreman
darted
among
the
groups
of
watchers
and
his
distress
was
very
plain
dorn
had
gotten
out
of
sight
lenore
still
held
his
coat
and
wondered
what
he
was
doing
she
was
thoroughly
angry
and
marveled
at
her
composure
the
big
thresher
was
reduced
to
a
blazing
smoking
hulk
in
short
order
dorn
came
striding
up
his
face
was
pale
and
his
mouth
set
anderson
you
got
to
make
a
strong
stand
and
quick
he
said
deliberately
i
reckon
an
i
ready
if
it
the
right
time
replied
the
rancher
but
what
can
we
prove
that
proof
declared
dorn
pointing
at
the
ruined
thresher
do
you
know
all
your
honest
hands
yes
an
i
got
enough
to
clean
up
this
outfit
in
no
time
we
only
waitin
what
for
wal
i
reckon
for
what
just
come
off
do
let
them
go
any
farther
look
at
these
fellows
ca
you
tell
the
from
the
others
no
i
ca
unless
i
count
all
the
new
every
one
you
do
know
here
is
in
with
that
gang
declared
dorn
and
he
waved
a
swift
hand
at
the
groups
his
eyes
swept
piercingly
over
and
apparently
through
the
men
nearest
at
hand
at
this
juncture
jake
and
bill
with
two
other
cowboys
strode
up
to
anderson
another
accident
boss
said
jake
sarcastically
ai
it
about
time
we
corralled
some
of
this
outfit
anderson
did
not
reply
he
had
suddenly
imitated
lenore
who
had
become
solely
bent
upon
dorn
look
that
indeed
was
cause
for
interest
it
was
directed
at
a
member
of
the
nearest
group
a
man
in
rough
garb
with
pulled
over
his
eyes
as
lenore
looked
she
saw
this
man
suddenly
becoming
aware
of
dorn
scrutiny
hastily
turn
and
walk
away
hold
on
called
dorn
his
voice
a
ringing
command
it
halted
every
moving
person
on
that
part
of
the
field
then
dorn
actually
bounded
across
the
intervening
space
come
on
boys
said
anderson
get
in
this
dorn
spotted
some
one
an
now
that
all
we
want
lenore
stick
close
behind
me
jake
you
keep
near
her
they
moved
hastily
to
back
up
dorn
who
had
already
reached
the
workman
he
had
halted
anderson
took
out
a
whistle
and
blew
such
a
shrill
blast
that
it
deafened
lenore
and
must
have
been
heard
all
over
the
not
improbably
that
was
a
signal
agreed
upon
between
anderson
and
his
men
lenore
gathered
that
all
had
been
in
readiness
for
a
concerted
movement
and
that
her
father
believed
dorn
action
had
brought
the
climax
have
i
seen
you
before
queried
dorn
sharply
the
man
shook
his
head
and
kept
it
bent
a
little
and
then
he
began
to
edge
back
nearer
to
the
stragglers
who
slowly
closed
into
a
group
behind
him
he
seemed
nervous
shifty
he
ca
speak
english
spoke
up
one
of
them
gruffly
dorn
looked
aggressive
and
stern
suddenly
his
hand
flashed
out
to
snatch
off
the
which
hid
the
fellow
face
amazingly
a
gray
wig
came
with
it
this
man
was
not
old
he
had
fair
thick
hair
for
a
moment
dorn
gazed
at
the
and
wig
then
with
a
fierce
action
he
threw
them
down
and
swept
a
clutching
hand
for
the
man
the
fellow
dodged
and
straightening
up
he
reached
for
a
gun
but
dorn
lunged
upon
him
then
followed
a
hard
grappling
sound
and
a
hoarse
yell
something
bright
glinted
in
the
sun
it
made
a
sweeping
circle
belched
fire
and
smoke
the
report
stunned
lenore
she
shut
her
eyes
and
clung
to
her
father
she
heard
cries
a
scuffling
sodden
blows
jake
bill
called
anderson
hold
on
no
yet
dorn
hash
out
of
that
fellow
but
watch
the
others
sharp
then
lenore
looked
again
dorn
had
twisted
the
man
around
and
was
in
the
act
of
stripping
off
the
further
disguise
of
beard
disclosing
the
pale
and
convulsed
face
of
a
comparatively
young
man
glidden
burst
out
dorn
his
voice
had
a
terrible
ring
of
furious
amaze
his
whole
body
seemed
to
gather
as
in
a
knot
and
then
to
spring
the
man
called
glidden
went
down
before
that
onslaught
and
his
gun
went
flying
aside
three
of
glidden
group
started
for
it
the
cowboy
bill
leaped
forward
a
gun
in
each
hand
hyar
back
he
yelled
and
then
all
except
the
two
struggling
principals
grew
rigid
lenore
heart
was
burning
in
her
throat
the
movements
of
dorn
were
too
swift
for
her
sight
but
glidden
she
saw
handled
as
if
by
a
giant
up
and
down
he
seemed
thrown
with
bloody
face
flinging
arms
while
he
uttered
hoarse
bawls
dorn
form
grew
more
distinct
it
plunged
and
swung
in
frenzied
energy
lenore
heard
men
running
and
yells
from
all
around
her
father
spread
wide
his
arm
before
her
so
that
she
had
to
bend
low
to
see
he
shouted
a
warning
jake
was
holding
a
gun
thrust
forward
boss
he
goin
to
kill
glidden
said
the
cowboy
in
a
low
tone
anderson
reply
was
incoherent
but
its
meaning
was
plain
lenore
lips
and
tongue
almost
denied
her
utterance
oh
do
let
him
the
crowd
behind
the
wrestling
couple
swayed
back
and
forth
and
men
changed
places
here
and
there
bill
strode
across
the
space
guns
leveled
evidently
this
action
was
due
to
the
threatening
movements
of
several
workmen
who
crouched
as
if
to
leap
on
dorn
as
he
whirled
in
his
fight
with
glidden
wal
it
about
time
yelled
anderson
as
a
number
of
lean
rangy
men
rushing
from
behind
reached
bill
side
there
to
present
an
armed
and
threatening
front
all
eyes
now
centered
on
dorn
and
glidden
lenore
seeing
clearly
for
the
first
time
suffered
a
strange
hot
paroxysm
of
emotion
never
before
experienced
by
her
it
left
her
weak
it
seemed
to
stultify
the
cry
that
had
been
trying
to
escape
her
she
wanted
to
scream
that
dorn
must
not
kill
the
man
yet
there
was
a
ferocity
in
her
that
froze
the
cry
glidden
coat
and
blouse
were
half
torn
off
blood
covered
him
he
strained
and
flung
himself
weakly
in
that
iron
clutch
he
was
beaten
and
bent
back
his
tongue
hung
out
bloody
fluttering
with
strangled
cries
a
ghastly
face
appalling
in
its
fear
of
death
lenore
broke
her
mute
spell
of
mingled
horror
and
passion
for
god
sake
do
let
dorn
kill
him
she
implored
why
not
muttered
anderson
that
glidden
he
killed
father
burned
his
wheat
ruined
him
dad
for
sake
she
cried
brokenly
jake
stop
him
yelled
anderson
pull
him
off
as
lenore
saw
it
with
eyes
again
half
failing
her
jake
could
not
separate
dorn
from
his
victim
leggo
dorn
he
yelled
you
cheatin
the
gallows
hey
bill
he
a
bull
help
hyar
quick
lenore
did
not
see
the
resulting
conflict
but
she
could
tell
by
something
that
swayed
the
crowd
when
glidden
had
been
freed
hold
up
this
outfit
yelled
anderson
to
his
men
come
on
jake
drag
him
along
jake
appeared
leading
the
disheveled
and
dorn
son
you
did
my
heart
good
but
there
was
some
around
here
who
want
you
to
spill
blood
an
that
well
for
i
am
seein
red
you
take
dorn
an
lenore
a
piece
toward
the
house
then
hurry
back
then
lenore
felt
that
she
had
hold
of
dorn
arm
and
she
was
listening
to
jake
without
understanding
a
word
he
said
while
she
did
hear
her
father
yell
of
command
line
up
there
you
jake
walked
so
swiftly
that
lenore
had
to
run
to
keep
up
dorn
stumbled
he
spoke
incoherently
he
tried
to
stop
at
this
lenore
clasped
his
arm
and
cried
oh
kurt
come
home
with
me
they
hurried
down
the
slope
lenore
kept
looking
back
the
crowd
appeared
bunched
now
with
little
motion
that
relieved
her
there
was
no
more
fighting
presently
dorn
appeared
to
go
more
willingly
he
had
relaxed
let
go
jake
he
said
i
all
right
now
that
arm
hurts
wal
you
excuse
me
dorn
for
handlin
you
rough
mebbe
you
remember
punchin
me
one
when
i
got
between
you
an
glidden
did
i
i
could
see
jake
said
dorn
his
voice
was
weak
and
had
a
spent
ring
of
passion
in
it
he
did
not
look
at
lenore
but
kept
his
face
turned
toward
the
cowboy
i
reckon
this
fur
enough
rejoined
jake
halting
and
looking
back
no
one
comin
an
there
be
hell
to
pay
out
there
you
go
on
to
the
house
with
miss
lenore
will
you
yes
replied
dorn
rustle
along
then
an
you
miss
lenore
do
you
worry
none
about
us
lenore
nodded
and
holding
dorn
arm
closely
she
walked
as
fast
as
she
could
down
the
lane
i
i
kept
your
coat
she
said
though
i
never
thought
of
it
till
just
now
she
was
trembling
all
over
hot
and
cold
by
turns
afraid
to
look
up
at
him
yet
immensely
proud
of
him
with
a
strange
sickening
dread
he
walked
rather
dejectedly
now
or
else
bent
somewhat
from
weakness
she
stole
a
quick
glance
at
his
face
it
was
white
as
a
sheet
suddenly
she
felt
something
wet
and
warm
trickle
from
his
arm
down
into
her
hand
blood
she
shuddered
but
did
not
lose
her
hold
after
a
faintish
instant
there
came
a
change
in
her
are
you
hurt
she
asked
i
guess
not
i
do
know
he
said
but
the
the
blood
she
faltered
he
held
up
his
hands
his
knuckles
were
bloody
and
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
from
injury
to
them
or
not
but
his
left
forearm
was
badly
cut
the
gun
cut
me
and
he
bit
me
too
said
dorn
i
sorry
you
were
there
what
a
beastly
spectacle
for
you
never
mind
me
she
murmured
i
all
right
but
oh
she
broke
off
eloquently
was
it
you
who
had
the
cowboys
pull
me
off
him
jake
said
as
he
broke
me
loose
miss
lenore
sake
it
was
dad
who
sent
them
but
i
begged
him
to
that
was
glidden
the
agitator
and
german
agent
he
just
the
same
as
murdered
my
father
he
burned
my
wheat
lost
my
all
yes
i
i
know
kurt
whispered
lenore
i
meant
to
kill
him
that
was
easy
to
tell
oh
thank
god
you
did
not
come
let
us
stop
she
could
not
face
the
piercing
gloomy
eyes
that
went
through
her
why
should
you
care
some
one
will
have
to
kill
glidden
oh
do
not
talk
so
she
implored
surely
now
you
glad
you
did
not
i
do
understand
myself
but
i
certainly
sorry
you
were
there
there
a
beast
in
men
in
me
i
had
a
gun
in
my
pocket
but
do
you
think
i
have
used
it
i
wanted
to
feel
his
flesh
tear
his
bones
break
his
blood
spurt
kurt
yes
that
was
the
hun
in
me
he
declared
in
sudden
bitter
passion
oh
my
friend
do
not
talk
so
she
cried
you
make
me
oh
there
is
hun
in
you
yes
that
what
ails
me
there
is
she
flashed
back
roused
to
passion
you
had
been
made
desperate
you
acted
as
any
wronged
man
you
fought
he
tried
to
kill
you
i
saw
the
gun
no
one
could
blame
you
i
had
my
own
reason
for
begging
dad
to
keep
you
from
killing
him
a
selfish
reason
but
i
tell
you
i
was
so
furious
so
wrought
up
that
if
it
had
been
any
man
but
he
should
have
killed
him
lenore
you
beyond
my
understanding
replied
dorn
with
emotion
but
i
thank
you
for
excusing
me
for
standing
up
for
me
it
was
nothing
how
you
bleed
does
that
hurt
i
no
pain
no
feeling
at
all
except
a
sort
of
dying
down
in
me
of
what
must
have
been
hell
they
reached
the
house
and
went
in
no
one
was
there
which
fact
relieved
lenore
i
glad
mother
and
the
girls
wo
see
you
she
said
hurriedly
go
up
to
your
room
i
bring
bandages
he
complied
without
any
comment
lenore
searched
for
what
she
needed
to
treat
a
wound
and
ran
dorn
was
sitting
on
a
chair
in
his
room
holding
his
arm
from
which
blood
dripped
to
the
floor
he
smiled
at
her
you
would
be
a
pretty
red
cross
nurse
he
said
lenore
placed
a
bowl
of
water
on
the
floor
and
kneeling
beside
dorn
took
his
arm
and
began
to
bathe
it
he
winced
the
blood
covered
her
fingers
my
blood
on
your
hands
he
exclaimed
morbidly
german
blood
kurt
you
out
of
your
head
retorted
lenore
hotly
if
you
dare
to
say
that
again
i
she
broke
off
what
will
you
do
lenore
faltered
what
would
she
do
a
revelation
must
come
sooner
or
later
and
the
strain
had
begun
to
wear
upon
her
she
was
stirred
to
her
depths
and
instincts
there
were
leaping
no
sweet
gentle
kindly
sympathy
would
avail
with
this
tragic
youth
he
must
be
carried
by
storm
something
of
the
violence
he
had
shown
with
glidden
seemed
necessary
to
make
him
forget
himself
all
his
whole
soul
must
be
set
in
one
direction
he
could
not
see
that
she
loved
him
when
she
had
looked
it
acted
it
almost
spoken
it
his
blindness
was
not
to
be
endured
kurt
dorn
do
dare
to
to
say
that
again
she
ceased
bathing
his
arm
and
looked
up
at
him
suddenly
quite
pale
i
apologize
i
am
only
bitter
he
said
do
mind
what
i
say
it
so
good
of
you
to
do
this
then
in
silence
lenore
dressed
his
wound
and
if
her
heart
did
beat
unwontedly
her
fingers
were
steady
and
deft
he
thanked
her
with
moody
eyes
seeing
far
beyond
her
when
i
lie
over
there
with
if
you
go
she
interrupted
he
was
indeed
hopeless
i
advise
you
to
rest
a
little
i
like
to
know
what
becomes
of
glidden
he
said
so
should
i
that
worries
me
were
there
a
lot
of
cowboys
with
guns
so
many
that
there
no
need
for
you
to
go
out
and
start
another
fight
i
did
start
it
did
i
you
surely
did
she
left
him
then
turning
in
the
doorway
to
ask
him
please
to
be
quiet
and
let
the
day
go
by
without
seeking
those
excited
men
again
he
smiled
but
he
did
not
promise
for
lenore
the
time
dragged
between
dread
and
suspense
from
her
window
she
saw
a
motley
crowd
pass
down
the
lane
to
the
main
road
no
harvesters
were
working
at
the
noon
meal
only
her
mother
and
the
girls
were
present
word
had
come
that
the
men
were
being
driven
from
many
waters
anderson
worried
and
lenore
sisters
for
once
were
quiet
all
afternoon
the
house
was
lifeless
no
one
came
or
left
lenore
listened
to
every
little
sound
it
relieved
her
that
dorn
had
remained
in
his
room
her
hope
was
that
the
threatened
trouble
had
been
averted
but
something
told
her
that
the
worst
was
yet
to
come
it
was
nearly
when
she
heard
the
men
returning
they
came
in
a
body
noisy
and
loitering
as
if
reluctant
to
break
away
from
one
another
she
heard
the
horses
tramp
into
the
barns
and
the
loud
voices
of
drivers
when
she
went
she
encountered
her
father
he
looked
impressive
triumphant
his
effort
at
evasion
did
not
deceive
lenore
but
she
realized
at
once
that
in
this
instance
she
could
not
get
any
news
from
him
he
said
everything
was
all
right
and
that
men
were
to
be
deported
from
washington
but
he
did
not
want
any
supper
and
he
had
a
significant
interview
with
dorn
lenore
longed
to
know
what
was
pending
dorn
voice
when
he
said
at
his
door
anderson
i
go
was
ringing
hard
and
deadly
it
frightened
lenore
go
where
what
were
they
going
to
do
lenore
thought
of
the
vigilantes
her
father
had
organized
was
an
ordeal
dorn
ate
a
little
then
excusing
himself
he
went
back
to
his
room
lenore
got
through
the
meal
somehow
and
going
outside
she
encountered
jake
the
moment
she
questioned
him
she
knew
something
extraordinary
had
taken
place
or
was
about
to
take
place
she
coaxed
and
entreated
for
once
jake
was
hard
to
manage
but
the
more
excuses
he
made
the
more
he
evaded
her
the
greater
became
need
to
know
and
at
last
she
wore
the
cowboy
out
he
could
not
resist
her
tears
which
began
to
flow
in
spite
of
her
see
hyar
miss
lenore
i
reckon
you
care
a
heap
fer
young
dorn
your

a

kurt
dorn
to
go
wherever
he
going
wal
i
should
smile

dad

the
way

handles
replied
jake
significantly
vigilantes
whispered
lenore
chapter
xx
lenore
waited
for
kurt
and
stood
half
concealed
behind
the
curtains
it
had
dawned
upon
her
that
she
had
an
ordeal
at
hand
her
heart
palpitated
she
heard
his
quick
step
on
the
stairs
she
called
before
she
showed
herself
hello
oh
but
you
startled
me
he
exclaimed
he
had
been
surprised
too
at
the
abrupt
meeting
certainly
he
had
not
been
thinking
of
her
his
pale
determined
face
attested
to
stern
and
excitable
thought
he
halted
before
her
where
are
you
going
asked
lenore
to
see
your
father
what
about
it
rather
important
he
replied
with
hesitation
will
it
take
long
he
showed
embarrassment
i
he
we
be
occupied
all
evening
indeed
very
well
if
you
rather
be
than
spend
the
evening
with
me
lenore
turned
away
affecting
a
disdainful
and
hurt
manner
lenore
it
not
that
he
burst
out
i
i
rather
spend
an
evening
with
you
than
anybody
else
or
do
anything
that
very
easy
to
say
dorn
she
returned
lightly
but
it
true
he
protested
come
out
of
the
hall
father
will
hear
us
she
said
and
led
him
into
the
room
it
was
not
so
light
in
there
but
what
light
there
was
fell
upon
his
face
and
left
hers
in
shadow
i
made
an
an
appointment
for
he
declared
with
difficulty
ca
you
break
it
she
asked
no
that
would
lay
me
open
to
to
cowardice
perhaps
your
displeasure
kurt
dorn
it
brave
to
give
up
some
things
and
if
you
go
incur
displeasure
go
he
ejaculated
staring
at
her
oh
i
know
and
i
well
not
flattered
to
see
you
rather
go
hang
than
stay
here
with
me
lenore
did
not
feel
the
assurance
and
composure
with
which
she
spoke
she
was
struggling
with
her
own
feelings
she
believed
that
just
as
soon
as
she
and
kurt
understood
each
other
faced
each
other
without
any
dissimulation
then
she
would
feel
free
and
strong
if
only
she
could
put
the
situation
on
a
sincere
footing
she
must
work
for
that
her
difficulty
was
with
a
sense
of
falsity
there
was
no
time
to
plan
she
must
change
his
mind
her
words
had
made
him
start
then
you
know
he
asked
of
course
i
sorry
for
that
he
replied
soberly
as
he
brushed
a
hand
up
through
his
wet
hair
but
you
will
stay
home
no
he
returned
shortly
and
he
looked
hard
kurt
i
do
want
mixed
up
with
any
she
said
earnestly
i
a
citizen
of
washington
i
join
the
vigilantes
i
american
i
been
ruined
by
these
no
man
in
the
west
has
lost
so
much
father
home
land
my
great
harvest
of
wheat
why
should
i
go
there
no
reason
except
she
replied
rather
unsteadily
he
drew
himself
up
with
a
deep
breath
as
if
fortifying
himself
that
a
mighty
good
reason
but
you
will
be
kinder
if
you
withdraw
your
objections
ca
you
conceive
of
any
reason
why
i
i
beg
you
not
to
go
i
ca
he
replied
staring
at
her
it
seemed
that
every
moment
he
spent
in
her
presence
increased
her
effect
upon
him
lenore
felt
this
and
that
buoyed
up
her
failing
courage
kurt
you
made
a
very
distressing
a
terrible
and
horrible
blunder
she
said
with
a
desperation
that
must
have
seemed
something
else
to
him
my
heavens
what
have
i
done
he
gasped
his
face
growing
paler
how
ready
he
was
to
see
more
catastrophe
it
warmed
her
heart
and
strengthened
her
nerve
the
moment
had
come
even
if
she
did
lose
her
power
of
speech
she
still
could
show
him
what
his
blunder
was
nothing
in
all
her
life
had
ever
been
a
hundredth
part
as
hard
as
this
yet
as
the
words
formed
her
whole
heart
seemed
to
be
behind
them
forcing
them
out
if
only
he
did
not
misunderstand
then
she
looked
directly
at
him
and
tried
to
speak
her
first
attempt
was
inarticulate
her
second
was
a
whisper
did
you
ever
think
i
i
might
care
for
you
it
was
as
if
a
shock
went
over
him
leaving
him
trembling
but
he
did
not
look
as
amazed
as
incredulous
no
i
certainly
never
did
he
said
well
that
your
blunder
for
i
i
do
you
you
never
never
asked
me
you
do
what
care
for
me
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
by
that
lenore
was
fighting
many
emotions
now
the
one
most
poignant
being
a
wild
desire
to
escape
which
battled
with
an
equally
maddening
one
to
hide
her
face
on
his
breast
yet
she
could
see
how
white
he
had
grown
how
different
his
hands
worked
convulsively
and
his
eyes
pierced
her
very
soul
what
should
a
girl
mean
telling
she
cared
i
do
know
girls
are
beyond
me
he
replied
stubbornly
indeed
that
true
i
felt
so
far
beyond
you
i
had
to
come
to
this
lenore
he
burst
out
hoarsely
you
talk
in
riddles
you
been
so
strange
yet
so
fine
so
sweet
and
now
you
say
you
care
for
me
care
what
does
that
mean
a
word
can
drive
me
mad
but
i
never
dared
to
hope
i
love
you
love
you
love
you
my
god
you
all
i
left
to
love
i
do
you
think
you
a
monopoly
on
all
the
love
in
the
world
interrupted
lenore
coming
to
her
real
self
his
impassioned
declaration
was
all
she
needed
her
ordeal
was
over
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
believe
his
ears
or
eyes
monopoly
world
he
echoed
of
course
i
do
but
kurt
i
love
you
just
as
much
as
as
you
love
me
so
there
lenore
had
time
for
one
look
at
his
face
before
he
enveloped
her
what
a
relief
to
hide
her
own
it
was
pressed
to
his
breast
very
closely
her
eyes
shut
and
she
felt
hot
tears
under
the
lids
all
before
her
darkened
sight
seemed
confusion
whirling
chaos
it
seemed
that
she
could
not
breathe
and
strangely
did
not
need
to
how
unutterably
happy
she
felt
that
was
an
moment
wonderful
for
her
own
relief
and
gladness
full
of
changing
emotions
presently
kurt
appeared
to
be
coming
to
some
semblance
of
rationality
he
released
her
from
that
crushing
embrace
but
still
kept
an
arm
around
her
while
he
held
her
off
and
looked
at
her
lenore
will
you
kiss
me
he
whispered
she
could
have
cried
out
in
sheer
delight
at
the
wonder
of
that
whisper
in
her
ear
it
had
been
she
who
had
changed
the
world
for
kurt
dorn
yes
presently
she
replied
with
a
tremulous
little
laugh
wait
till
i
get
my
breath
i
was
beside
myself
am
so
yet
he
replied
low
voiced
as
if
in
awe
i
been
lifted
to
heaven
it
can
not
be
true
i
believe
yet
not
be
sure
till
you
kiss
me
you
lenore
anderson
this
girl
of
my
dreams
do
you
love
me
is
it
true
yes
kurt
indeed
i
do
very
dearly
she
replied
and
turned
to
look
up
into
his
face
it
was
transfigured
lenore
heart
swelled
as
a
deep
and
profound
emotion
waved
over
her
please
kiss
me
then
she
lifted
her
face
flushing
scarlet
their
lips
met
then
with
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
and
her
hands
closely
held
she
answered
the
thousand
and
one
questions
of
a
bewildered
and
exalted
lover
who
could
not
realize
the
truth
lenore
laughed
at
him
and
eloquently
furnished
proof
of
her
own
obsession
and
told
him
how
and
why
and
when
it
all
came
about
not
for
hours
did
kurt
come
back
to
actualities
i
forgot
about
the
vigilantes
he
exclaimed
suddenly
it
too
late
now
how
the
time
has
flown
oh
lenore
thought
of
other
things
breaks
in
alas
he
kissed
her
hand
and
got
up
another
change
was
coming
over
him
lenore
had
long
expected
the
moment
when
realization
would
claim
his
attention
she
was
prepared
yes
you
forgot
your
appointment
with
dad
and
the
vigilantes
missed
some
excitement
and
violence
his
face
had
grown
white
again
grave
now
and
troubled
may
i
speak
to
your
father
he
asked
yes
she
replied
if
i
come
back
from
the
war
well
not
crippled
will
you
promise
to
marry
me
kurt
i
promise
now
that
seemed
to
shake
him
but
lenore
it
is
not
fair
to
you
i
believe
a
soldier
should
bind
a
girl
by
marriage
or
engagement
before
he
goes
to
war
she
should
be
free
i
want
you
to
be
free
that
for
you
to
say
she
replied
softly
but
for
my
part
i
want
to
be
free
if
you
go
away
to
war
if
i
going
he
said
with
a
start
you
do
want
to
be
free
lenore
would
you
be
engaged
to
me
my
dear
boy
of
course
i
would
it
seems
i
does
it
she
replied
with
one
of
her
deep
low
laughs
he
gazed
at
her
fascinated
worked
upon
by
overwhelming
emotions
would
you
marry
me
before
i
go
yes
she
flashed
he
bent
and
bowed
then
under
the
storm
stumbling
to
her
almost
on
his
knees
he
brokenly
expressed
his
gratitude
his
wonder
his
passion
and
the
terrible
temptation
that
he
must
resist
which
she
must
help
him
to
resist
kurt
i
love
you
i
will
see
things
through
your
eyes
if
i
must
i
want
to
be
a
comfort
to
you
not
a
source
of
sorrow
but
lenore
what
comfort
can
i
find
to
leave
you
now
is
going
to
be
horrible
to
part
from
you
now
i
do
see
how
i
can
then
lenore
dared
to
broach
the
subject
so
delicate
so
momentous
you
need
not
part
from
me
my
father
has
asked
me
to
try
to
keep
you
home
he
secured
exemption
for
you
you
are
more
needed
here
than
at
the
front
you
can
feed
many
soldiers
you
would
be
doing
your
duty
with
honor
you
would
be
a
soldier
the
government
is
going
to
draft
young
men
for
farm
duty
why
not
you
there
are
many
good
reasons
why
you
would
be
better
than
most
young
men
because
you
know
wheat
and
wheat
is
to
become
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
no
one
misjudges
your
loyalty
and
surely
you
see
that
the
best
service
to
your
country
is
what
you
can
do
best
he
sat
down
beside
her
with
serious
frown
and
somber
eyes
lenore
are
you
asking
me
not
to
go
to
war
yes
i
am
she
replied
i
have
thought
it
all
over
i
given
up
my
brother
i
not
ask
you
to
stay
home
if
you
were
needed
at
the
front
as
much
as
here
that
question
i
have
had
out
with
my
conscience
kurt
do
think
me
a
silly
sentimental
girl
events
of
late
have
made
me
a
woman
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
that
the
most
amazing
of
all
you
lenore
anderson
my
american
girl
asking
me
not
to
go
to
war
but
dear
it
is
not
so
amazing
it
reasonable
your
peculiar
point
of
view
makes
it
look
different
i
am
no
weak
timid
girl
afraid
to
let
you
go
i
given
you
good
honorable
patriotic
reasons
for
your
exemption
from
draft
can
you
see
that
yes
i
grant
all
your
claims
i
know
wheat
well
enough
to
tell
you
that
if
vastly
more
is
not
done
the
world
will
starve
that
would
hold
good
for
the
united
states
in
forty
years
without
war
then
if
you
see
my
point
why
are
you
opposed
to
it
she
asked
because
i
am
kurt
dorn
he
replied
bitterly
his
tone
his
gloom
made
her
shiver
it
would
take
all
her
intelligence
and
wit
and
reason
to
understand
him
and
vastly
more
than
that
to
change
him
she
thought
earnestly
this
was
to
be
an
ordeal
profoundly
more
difficult
than
the
confession
of
her
love
it
was
indeed
a
crisis
dwarfing
the
other
she
had
met
she
sensed
in
him
a
remarkably
strange
attitude
toward
this
war
compared
with
that
of
her
brother
or
other
boys
she
knew
who
had
gone
because
you
are
kurt
dorn
she
said
thoughtfully
it
in
the
name
then
but
i
think
it
a
pretty
name
a
good
name
have
i
not
consented
to
accept
it
as
mine
for
life
he
could
not
answer
that
blindly
he
reached
out
with
a
shaking
hand
to
find
hers
to
hold
it
close
lenore
felt
the
tumult
in
him
she
was
shocked
a
great
tenderness
sweet
and
motherly
flooded
over
her
dearest
in
this
dark
hour
that
was
so
bright
a
little
while
ago
you
must
not
keep
anything
from
me
she
replied
i
will
be
true
to
you
i
will
crush
my
selfish
hopes
i
will
be
your
mother
tell
me
why
you
must
go
to
war
because
you
are
kurt
dorn
my
father
was
german
he
hated
this
country
yours
and
mine
he
plotted
with
the
he
hated
your
father
and
wanted
to
destroy
him
before
he
died
he
realized
his
crime
for
so
i
take
the
few
words
he
spoke
to
jerry
but
all
the
same
he
was
a
traitor
to
my
country
i
bear
his
name
i
have
german
in
me
and
by
god
i
going
to
pay
his
deep
passionate
tones
struck
into
lenore
heart
she
fought
with
a
rising
terror
she
was
beginning
to
understand
him
how
helpless
she
felt
how
she
prayed
for
inspiration
for
wisdom
pay
how
she
asked
in
the
only
way
possible
i
see
that
a
dorn
goes
to
war
who
will
show
his
american
blood
who
will
fight
and
kill
and
be
killed
his
passion
then
was
more
than
patriotism
it
had
its
springs
in
the
very
core
of
his
being
he
had
it
seemed
a
debt
that
he
must
pay
but
there
was
more
than
this
in
his
grim
determination
and
lenore
divined
that
it
lay
hidden
in
his
bitter
reference
to
his
german
blood
he
hated
that
doubted
himself
because
of
it
she
realized
now
that
to
keep
him
from
going
to
war
would
be
to
make
him
doubt
his
manhood
and
eventually
to
despise
himself
no
longer
could
she
think
of
persuading
him
to
stay
home
she
must
forget
herself
she
knew
then
that
she
had
the
power
to
keep
him
and
she
could
use
it
but
she
must
not
do
so
this
tragic
thing
was
a
matter
of
his
soul
but
if
he
went
to
war
with
this
bitter
obsession
with
this
wrong
motive
this
passionate
desire
to
spill
blood
in
him
that
he
hated
he
would
lose
his
soul
he
must
be
changed
all
her
love
all
her
woman
flashing
subtle
thought
concentrated
on
this
fact
how
strange
the
choice
that
had
been
given
her
not
only
must
she
relinquish
her
hope
of
keeping
him
home
but
she
must
perhaps
go
to
desperate
ends
to
send
him
away
with
a
changed
spirit
the
moment
of
decision
was
agony
for
her
kurt
this
is
a
terrible
hour
for
both
of
us
she
said
but
thank
heaven
you
have
confessed
to
me
now
i
will
confess
to
you
confess
you
what
nonsense
he
exclaimed
but
in
his
surprise
he
lifted
his
head
from
his
hands
to
look
at
her
when
we
came
in
here
my
mind
was
made
up
to
make
you
stay
home
father
begged
me
to
do
it
and
i
had
my
own
selfish
motive
it
was
love
oh
i
do
love
you
kurt
more
than
you
can
dream
of
i
justified
my
resolve
i
told
you
that
but
i
wanted
you
i
wanted
your
love
your
presence
i
longed
for
a
home
with
you
as
husband
master
father
to
my
babies
i
dreamed
of
all
it
filled
me
with
terror
to
think
of
you
going
to
war
you
might
be
crippled
mangled
murdered
oh
my
dear
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
so
i
meant
to
overcome
you
i
had
it
all
planned
i
meant
to
love
you
to
beg
you
to
kiss
you
to
make
you
stay
lenore
what
are
you
saying
he
cried
in
shocked
amaze
she
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
oh
i
could
i
could
have
kept
you
she
answered
low
voiced
and
triumphant
it
fills
me
with
joy
tell
me
i
could
have
kept
you
tell
me
yes
i
no
power
to
resist
you
but
i
might
have
hated
hush
it
all
might
have
i
risen
above
myself
lenore
you
distress
me
a
little
while
ago
you
bewildered
me
with
your
sweetness
and
love
now
you
look
like
an
angel
or
a
goddess
oh
to
have
your
face
like
this
always
with
me
yet
it
distresses
me
so
terrible
in
purpose
what
are
you
about
to
tell
me
i
see
something
listen
she
broke
in
i
meant
to
make
you
weak
i
implore
you
now
to
be
strong
you
must
go
to
war
but
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
i
beg
you
to
go
with
a
changed
spirit
you
were
about
to
do
a
terrible
thing
you
hated
the
german
in
you
and
meant
to
kill
it
by
violence
you
despised
the
german
blood
and
you
meant
to
spill
it
like
a
wild
man
you
would
have
rushed
to
fight
to
stab
and
beat
to
murder
and
you
would
have
left
your
breast
open
for
a
oh
i
know
it
kurt
you
are
horribly
wrong
that
is
no
way
to
go
to
war
war
is
a
terrible
business
but
men
do
wage
it
for
motives
such
as
yours
we
americans
all
have
different
strains
of
blood
english
french
german
one
is
as
good
as
another
you
are
obsessed
you
are
out
of
your
head
on
this
german
question

idea

fell
upon

before
her
to
bury
his
face
in
her
lap
his
whole

shook
his

plucked
at

harvest
two
lanterns
furnished
light
enough
to
show
a
bare
barnlike
structure
the
plotters
the
grim
set
of
hard
lips
below
the
and
big
hands
spread
out
ready
to
draw
from
the
hat
that
was
passing
the
talk
was
low
and
serious
no
names
were
spoken
a
heavy
man
at
the
head
of
the
table
said
we
thirty
picked
men
represent
the
country
let
each
member
here
write
on
his
slip
of
paper
his
choice
of
punishment
for
the
death
or
deportation
the
members
of
the
band
bent
their
masked
faces
and
wrote
in
a
dead
silence
a
noiseless
wind
blew
through
the
place
the
lanterns
flickered
huge
shadows
moved
on
the
walls
when
the
papers
had
been
passed
back
to
the
leader
he
read
them
deportation
he
announced
so
much
for
the
men
now
for
the
leader
but
before
we
vote
on
what
to
do
with
glidden
let
me
read
an
extract
from
one
of
his
speeches
this
is
authentic
it
has
been
furnished
by
the
detective
lately
active
in
our
interest
also
it
has
been
published
i
read
it
because
i
want
to
bring
home
to
you
all
an
issue
that
goes
beyond
our
own
personal
fortunes
here
leaning
toward
the
flickering
flare
of
the
lantern
the
leader
read
from
a
slip
of
paper
if
the
militia
are
sent
out
here
to
hinder
the
we
will
make
it
so
damned
hot
for
the
government
that
no
troops
will
be
able
to
go
to
france
i
do
give
a
damn
what
this
country
is
fighting
for
i
am
fighting
for
the
rights
of
labor
american
soldiers
are
uncle
sam
scabs
in
disguise
the
deep
impressive
voice
ended
the
leader
huge
fist
descended
upon
the
table
with
a
crash
he
gazed
up
and
down
the
rows
of
sinister
masked
figures
have
you
anything
to
say
no
replied
one
pass
the
slips
said
another
and
then
a
man
evidently
on
in
years
for
his
hair
was
gray
and
he
looked
bent
got
up
neighbors
he
began
i
lived
here
in
the
early
days
for
the
last
few
years
i
been
apologizing
for
my
home
town
i
do
want
to
apologize
for
it
any
longer
he
sat
down
and
a
current
seemed
to
wave
from
him
around
that
dark
square
of
figures
the
leader
cleared
his
throat
as
if
he
had
much
to
say
but
he
did
not
speak
instead
he
passed
the
hat
each
man
drew
forth
a
slip
of
paper
and
wrote
upon
it
the
action
was
not
slow
presently
the
hat
returned
round
the
table
to
the
leader
he
spilled
its
contents
and
with
steady
hand
picked
up
the
first
slip
of
paper
death
he
read
sonorously
and
laid
it
down
to
pick
up
another
again
he
spoke
that
grim
word
the
third
brought
forth
the
same
and
likewise
the
next
and
all
until
the
verdict
had
been
called
out
thirty
times
at
daylight
we
meet
boomed
out
that
heavy
voice
instruct
glidden
guards
to
make
a
show
of
resistance
we
hang
glidden
to
the
railroad
bridge
then
each
of
you
get
your
gangs
together
round
up
all
the
drive
them
to
the
railroad
yard
there
we
put
them
aboard
a
railroad
train
of
empty
cars
and
that
train
will
pass
under
the
bridge
where
glidden
will
be
hanging
we
escort
them
out
of
the
country
that
august
dawn
was
gray
and
cool
with
gold
and
pink
beginning
to
break
over
the
dark
eastern
ranges
the
town
had
not
yet
awakened
it
slept
unaware
of
the
stealthy
forms
passing
down
the
gray
road
and
of
the
distant
hum
of
and
trot
of
hoofs
glidden
place
of
confinement
was
a
square
warehouse
near
the
edge
of
town
before
the
improvised
jail
guards
paced
up
and
down
strangely
alert
daylight
had
just
cleared
away
the
gray
when
a
crowd
of
masked
men
appeared
as
if
by
magic
and
bore
down
upon
the
guards
there
was
an
apparent
desperate
resistance
but
significantly
no
cries
or
shots
the
guards
were
overpowered
and
bound
the
door
of
the
jail
yielded
to
heavy
blows
of
an
ax
in
the
corner
of
a
dim
bare
room
groveled
glidden
bound
so
that
he
had
little
use
of
his
body
but
he
was
terribly
awake
when
six
men
entered
he
asked
hoarsely
what
you
after
what
you
mean
they
jerked
him
erect
they
cut
the
bonds
from
his
legs
they
dragged
him
out
into
the
light
of
breaking
day
when
he
saw
the
masked
and
armed
force
he
cried
my
god
you
do
with
me
ghastly
working
sweating
his
face
betrayed
his
terror
you
to
be
hanged
by
the
neck
spoke
a
heavy
solemn
voice
the
man
would
have
collapsed
but
for
the
strong
hands
that
upheld
him
what
for
he
gasped
for
crimes
for
treason
for
speeches
no
american
can
stand
in
days
like
these
then
this
man
read
to
glidden
words
of
his
own
do
you
recognize
that
glidden
saw
how
he
had
spoken
his
own
doom
yes
i
said
that
he
had
nerve
left
to
say
but
i
insist
on
arrest
trial
justice
i
no
criminal
i
big
interests
behind
me
you
suffer
a
loop
of
a
lasso
slung
over
his
head
and
jerked
tight
choked
off
his
intelligible
utterance
but
as
the
silent
ruthless
men
dragged
him
away
he
gave
vent
to
terrible
cries
the
sun
rose
red
over
the
fertile
valley
over
the
harvest
fields
and
the
pastures
and
the
orchards
and
over
the
many
towns
that
appeared
lost
in
the
green
and
gold
of
luxuriance
in
the
harvest
districts
west
of
the
river
all
the
towns
were
visited
by
that
halted
long
enough
for
a
warning
to
be
shouted
to
the
citizens
keep
off
the
streets
simultaneously
armed
forces
of
men
on
foot
and
on
horseback
too
numerous
to
count
appeared
in
the
roads
and
the
harvest
fields
they
accosted
every
man
they
met
if
he
were
recognized
or
gave
proof
of
an
honest
identity
he
was
allowed
to
go
otherwise
he
was
marched
along
under
arrest
these
armed
forces
were
thorough
in
their
search
and
in
the
country
districts
they
had
an
especial
interest
in
likely
and
around
old
barns
and
in
the
towns
they
searched
every
corner
that
was
big
enough
to
hide
a
man
so
it
happened
that
many
motley
groups
of
men
were
driven
toward
the
railroad
line
where
they
were
held
until
a
of
empty
came
along
this
train
halted
long
enough
to
have
the
contingent
driven
aboard
with
its
special
armed
guard
following
and
then
it
proceeded
on
to
the
next
station
as
stations
were
many
so
were
the
halts
and
news
of
the
train
with
its
strange
freight
flashed
ahead
crowds
lined
the
railroad
tracks
many
boys
and
men
in
these
crowds
carried
rifles
and
pistols
which
they
leveled
at
the
prisoners
as
the
train
passed
jeers
and
taunts
and
threats
accompanied
this
presentation
of
guns
before
the
last
station
of
that
wheat
district
was
reached
full
three
hundred
members
of
the
or
otherwise
suspicious
characters
were
packed
into
the
open
cars
at
the
last
stop
the
number
was
greatly
augmented
and
the
armed
forces
were
cut
down
to
the
few
guards
who
were
to
see
the
deported
from
the
country
here
provisions
and
were
put
into
the
cars
and
amid
a
hurrahing
roar
of
thousands
the
train
with
its
strange
load
slowly
pulled
out
it
did
not
at
once
gather
headway
the
engine
whistled
a
prolonged
blast
a
signal
or
warning
not
lost
on
many
of
its
passengers
from
the
front
cars
rose
shrill
cries
that
alarmed
the
prisoners
in
the
rear
the
reason
soon
became
manifest
arms
pointed
and
eyes
stared
at
the
figure
of
a
man
hanging
from
a
rope
fastened
to
the
center
of
a
high
bridge
span
under
which
the
engine
was
about
to
pass
the
figure
swayed
in
the
wind
it
turned
round
disclosing
a
ghastly
distorted
face
and
a
huge
printed
placard
on
the
breast
then
it
turned
back
again
slowly
the
engine
drew
one
after
another
past
the
suspended
body
of
the
dead
man
there
were
no
more
cries
all
were
silent
in
that
train
all
faces
were
pale
all
eyes
transfixed
the
placard
on
the
hanged
man
breast
bore
in
glaring
red
a
strange
message
the
figures
were
the
ones
used
in
the
frontier
days
by
vigilantes
chapter
xxii
a
dusty
climbed
the
long
road
leading
up
to
the
neuman
ranch
it
was
not
far
from
wade
a
small
hamlet
of
the
section
and
the
slopes
of
the
hills
bare
and
yellow
with
waving
grain
bore
some
semblance
to
the
bend
country
four
men
a
driver
and
three
cowboys
were
in
the
automobile
a
big
stone
gate
marked
the
entrance
to
neuman
ranch
cars
and
vehicles
lined
the
roadside
men
were
passing
in
and
out
neuman
home
was
unpretentious
but
his
barns
and
granaries
and
were
built
on
a
large
scale

jake
complacently
as
he
made
as
if
to
the
car
bill
collapsed
in
his
seat
jake
he
expostulated
weakly
this

an
you
jake
why

the
smoothest
an
slickest

evidently
jake
had
a
vulnerable
point
he
straightened
up
with
a
little
swagger
wal
you
watch
me
he
said
i
fetch
the
big
dutchman
eatin
out
of
my

car
an

the
daylights
out
of
him
thet
be
powerful
fine
but
how
you
fellers
take
a
hunch
from
me
replied
jake
and
he
strode
off
up
the
lane
toward
the
jake
had
been
commissioned
to
acquaint
neuman
with
the
fact
that
recent
developments
demanded
his
immediate
presence
at
many
waters
the
cowboy
really
had
a
liking
for
the
job
though
he
pretended
not
to
neuman
had
not
yet
begun
harvesting
there
were
signs
to
experienced
eye
that
the
were
expected
this
very
day
jake
fancied
he
knew
why
the
rancher
had
put
off
his
harvesting
and
also
he
knew
that
the
extra
force
of
would
not
appear
he
was
regarded
with
curiosity
by
the
women
members
of
the
neuman
household
and
rather
enjoyed
it
there
were
several
comely
girls
in
evidence
jake
did
not
look
a
typical
northwest
foreman
and
laborer
booted
and
spurred
with
his
gun
swinging
visibly
and
his
big
sombrero
and
gaudy
scarf
he
looked
exactly
what
he
was
a
cowman
of
the
open
ranges
his
inquiries
elicited
the
fact
that
neuman
was
out
in
the
fields
waiting
for
the
wal
if
he
expectin
thet
outfit
of
he
never
harvest
said
jake
for
some
of
them
is
hanged
an
the
rest
run
out
of
the
country
jake
did
not
wait
to
see
the
effect
of
his
news
he
strode
back
toward
the
fields
and
with
the
eye
of
a
farmer
he
appraised
the
barns
and
corrals
and
the
fields
beyond
neuman
raised
much
wheat
and
enough
alfalfa
to
feed
his
stock
his
place
was
large
and
valuable
but
not
comparable
to
many
waters
out
in
the
were
engines
with
steam
already
up
with
combines
and
threshers
and
wagons
waiting
for
the
word
to
start
jake
enjoyed
the
keen
curiosity
roused
by
his
approach
neuman
strode
out
from
a
group
of
waiting
men
he
was
huge
of
build
and
bearded
with
eyes
are
you
neuman
inquired
jake
that
me
gruffly
came
the
reply
i
anderson
foreman
i
been
sent
over
to
tell
you
thet
wanted
pretty
bad
at
waters
the
man
stared
incredulously
what
who
wants
me
anderson
an
i
reckon
there
more
though
i
ai
informed
neuman
rumbled
a
curse
amaze
dominated
him
anderson
well
i
want
to
see
him
he
replied
i
reckon
you
do
was
the
cowboy
cool
reply
the
rancher
looked
him
up
and
down
however
familiar
his
type
was
to
anderson
it
was
strange
to
neuman
the
cowboy
breathed
a
potential
force
the
least
significant
thing
about
his
appearance
was
that
swinging
gun
he
seemed
cool
and
easy
with
hard
keen
eyes
face
took
a
shade
off
color
but
i
going
to
harvest
he
said
i
late
i
a
hundred
hands
coming
nope
you
have
none
comin
asserted
jake
what
ejaculated
neuman
reckon
it
near
ten
said
the
cowboy
we
run
over
here
powerful
fast
yes
it
near
ten
bellowed
neuman
on
the
verge
of
a
rage
i
have
coming
what
this
talk
wal
about
i
seen
all
your
damned
except
what
was
shot
an
hanged
loaded
in
a
cattlecar
an
started
out
of
the
country
a
blow
could
not
have
hit
harder
than
the
cowboy
biting
speech
astonishment
and
fear
shook
neuman
before
he
recovered
control
of
himself
if
it
true
what
that
to
me
he
bluffed
in
hoarse
accents
neuman
i
did
come
to
answer
questions
said
the
cowboy
curtly
my
boss
jest
sent
me
fer
you
an
if
you
bucked
on
comin
then
i
was
to
say
it
was
your
only
chance
to
avoid
publicity
an
bein
run
out
of
the
country
neuman
was
livid
of
face
now
and
shaking
all
over
his
huge
frame
anderson
threatens
me
he
shouted
anderson
suspicions
me
in
me
he
always
cheated
an
now
he
insults
say
it
ai
healthy
to
talk
like
thet
about
my
boss
interrupted
jake
forcibly
an
we
wastin
time
if
you
do
go
with
me
be
comin
back
the
whole
outfit
of
us
anderson
means
you
to
face
his
man
what
man
dorn
young
dorn
son
of
old
chris
dorn
of
the
bend
dorn
has
some
things
to
tell
you
thet
you
wo
want
made
public
anderson
you
a
square
deal
if
it
was
fer
thet
i
sling
my
gun
on
you
do
you
git
my
hunch
the
name
of
dorn
made
a
slack
figure
of
the
aggressive
neuman
all
right
i
go
he
said
gruffly
and
without
a
word
to
his
men
he
started
off
jake
followed
him
neuman
made
a
short
cut
to
the
gate
thus
avoiding
a
meeting
with
any
of
his
family
at
the
road
however
some
men
observed
him
and
called
in
surprise
but
he
waved
them
back
bill
you
an
andy
collect
yourselves
an
give
neuman
a
seat
said
jake
as
he
opened
the
door
to
allow
the
farmer
to
enter
the
two
cowboys
gave
neuman
the
whole
of
the
back
seat
and
they
occupied
the
smaller
side
seats
jake
took
his
place
beside
the
driver
burn
her
up
was
his
order
the
speed
of
the
car
made
conversation
impossible
until
the
limits
of
a
town
necessitated
slowing
down
then
the
cowboys
talked
for
all
the
attention
they
paid
to
neuman
he
might
as
well
not
have
been
present
before
long
the
driver
turned
into
a
road
that
followed
a
railroad
track
for
several
miles
and
then
crossed
it
to
enter
a
town
the
streets
were
crowded
with
people
and
the
car
had
to
be
driven
slowly
at
this
juncture
jake
suggested
let
go
down
by
the
bridge
sure
agreed
his
allies
then
the
driver
turned
down
a
still
more
peopled
street
that
sloped
a
little
and
evidently
overlooked
the
railroad
tracks
presently
they
came
in
sight
of
a
railroad
bridge
around
which
there
appeared
to
be
an
excited
yet
awestruck
throng
all
faces
were
turned
up
toward
the
swaying
form
of
a
man
hanging
by
a
rope
tied
to
the
high
span
of
the
bridge
wal
glidden
hangin
there
yet
remarked
jake
cheerfully
with
a
violent
start
neuman
looked
out
to
see
the
ghastly
placarded
figure
and
then
he
sank
slowly
back
in
his
seat
the
cowboys
apparently
took
no
notice
of
him
they
seemed
to
have
forgotten
his
presence
funny
they
cut
all
the
other
down
an
leave
glidden
there
observed
bill
them
vigilantes
sure
did
it
up
brown
added
andy
i
was
dyin
to
join
the
band
but
they
did
ask
me

jake
regretfully
an
i
ca
understand
why
onless
it
was
they
was
afeared
i
could
keep
a
secret
who

them
vigilantes

bill
curiously
wal
i
reckon
nobody
knows
but
i
seen
a
thousand
armed
men
this
mornin
they
sure
looked
bad

ought
to
have
seen
them

with
cocked
guns

andy
not
in
the
daytime
nobody
killed
by
this
citizens
protective
league
as
they
call
themselves
they
just
rounded
up
all
the
suspicious
men
herded
them
on
to
thet
an
carried
them
off
it
was
at
night
when
the
vigilantes
worked
masked
an
secret
an
sure
bloody
jest
like
the
old
vigilante
days
an
you
can
gamble
they
through
yet
uncle
sam
wo

to
send
any
soldiers

wal
i
should
smile
not
thet
be
a
disgrace
to
the
northwest
it
was
a
bad
time
fer
the
to
try
any
tricks
on
us
jake
shook
his
lean
head
and
his
jaw
bulged
he
might
have
been
haranguing
for
the
benefit
of
the
man
they
feigned
not
to
notice
but
it
was
plain
nevertheless
that
he
was
angry
what
gits
me
wuss
them
is
the
skunks
thet
give
uncle
sam
the
said
andy
with
dark
face
i
stand
fer
any
man
an
respect
him
if
he
aboveboard
an
makes
his
fight
in
the
open
but
them
coyotes

live
off
the
land
an
pretend
to
be
american
when
they
ai
they
make
me
pisen
mad
i
heerd
the
vigilantes
has
marked
men
like
thet
observed
bill
i
give
you
a
hunch
fellers
replied
jake
grimly
by
gawd
the
west
wo
stand
fer
traitors
all
the
way
to
many
waters
where
it
was
possible
to
talk
and
be
heard
the
cowboys
continued
in
like
strain
and
not
until
the
driver
halted
the
car
before
anderson
door
did
they
manifest
any
awareness
of
neuman
git
out
an
come
in
said
jake
to
the
pallid
sweating
rancher
he
led
neuman
into
the
hall
and
knocked
upon
anderson
study
door
it
was
opened
by
dorn
wal
hyar
we
are
announced
jake
and
his
very
nonchalance
attested
to
pride
anderson
was
standing
beside
his
desk
he
started
and
his
hand
flashed
back
significantly
as
he
sighted
his
rival
and
enemy
no
boss
was
your
orders
said
jake
an
neuman
packin
no
gun
it
was
plain
that
anderson
made
a
great
effort
at
restraint
but
he
failed
and
perhaps
the
realization
that
he
could
not
kill
this
man
liberated
his
passion
then
the
two
big
ranchers
faced
each
other
neuman
livid
and
shaking
anderson
black
as
a
neuman
you
hatched
up
a
plot
with
glidden
to
kill
me
said
anderson
bitterly
neuman
in
hoarse
brief
answer
denied
it
sure
deny
it
what
do
we
care
we
got
you
neuman
burst
out
anderson
his
heavy
voice
ringing
with
passion
but
it
not
your
plot
thet
me
there
been
a
good
many
men
tried
to
do
away
with
me
i
outplayed
you
in
many
a
deal
so
your
personal
hate
for
me
does
count
i
sore
an
you
an
me
ca
live
in
the
same
place
because
you
a
damned
traitor
you
lived
here
for
twenty
years
you
grown
rich
off
the
country
an
you
sell
us
to
your
rotten
germany
what
i
think
of
you
for
that
i
goin
to
tell
you
anderson
paused
to
take
a
deep
breath
then
he
began
to
curse
neuman
all
the
rough
years
of
his
frontier
life
as
well
as
the
quieter
ones
of
his
ranching
days
found
expression
in
the
swift
thunderous
roll
of
his
terrible
scorn
every
vile
name
that
had
ever
been
used
by
cowboy
outlaw
gambler
leaped
to
anderson
stinging
tongue
all
the
keen
hard
epithets
common
to
the
modern
day
he
flung
into
neuman
face
and
he
ended
with
a
profanity
that
was
as
individual
in
character
as
its
delivery
was
intense
i
callin
you
for
my
own
relief
he
concluded
an
not
that
i
expect
to
get
under
your
hide
then
he
paused
he
wiped
the
beaded
drops
from
his
forehead
and
he
coughed
and
shook
himself
his
big
fists
unclosed
passion
gave
place
to
dignity
neuman
it
a
pity
you
an
men
like
you
ca
see
the
truth
the
mystery
to
me
why
any
one
who
had
spent
half
a
lifetime
prospered
here
in
our
happy
an
beautiful
country
could
ever
hate
it
i
never
will
understand
that
but
i
do
understand
that
america
will
never
harbor
such
men
for
long
you
have
your
reasons
i
reckon
an
no
doubt
you
think
you
justified
that
the
tragedy
you
run
off
from
germany
you
will
not
live
there
of
your
own
choice
you
succeed
here
an
live
in
peace
an
plenty
an
by
god
you
take
up
with
a
lot
of
foreign
riffraff
an
the
people
you
owe
so
much
what
wrong
with
your
mind
think
it
over
an
the
last
word
i
have
for
you
anderson
turning
to
his
desk
took
up
a
cigar
and
lighted
it
he
was
calm
again
there
was
really
sadness
where
his
face
had
shown
only
fury
then
he
addressed
dorn
kurt
it
up
to
you
now
he
said
as
my
superintendent
an
partner
what
you
say
goes
with
me
i
do
know
what
bein
square
would
mean
in
relation
to
this
man
anderson
sat
down
heavily
in
his
desk
chair
and
his
face
became
obscured
in
cigar
smoke
neuman
do
you
recognize
me
asked
dorn
with
his
flashing
eyes
on
the
rancher
no
replied
neuman
i
chris
dorn
son
my
father
died
a
few
days
ago
he
overtaxed
his
heart
fighting
fire
in
the
wheat
fire
set
by
men
men
they
burned
our
wheat
ruined
us
neuman
showed
shock
at
the
news
at
the
sudden
death
of
an
old
friend
but
he
did
not
express
himself
in
words
do
you
deny
implication
in
glidden
plot
to
kill
anderson
demanded
dorn
yes
replied
neuman
well
you
a
liar
retorted
dorn
i
saw
you
with
glidden
and
my
father
i
followed
you
at
wheatly
out
along
the
railroad
tracks
i
slipped
up
and
heard
the
plot
it
was
i
who
snatched
the
money
from
my
father
neuman
nerve
was
gone
but
with
his
stupid
and
stubborn
process
of
thought
he
still
denied
stuttering
incoherently
glidden
has
been
hanged
went
on
dorn
a
vigilante
band
has
been
organized
here
in
the
valley
men
of
your
known
sympathy
will
not
be
safe
irrespective
of
your
plot
against
anderson
but
as
to
that
publicity
alone
will
be
enough
to
ruin
you
americans
of
the
west
will
not
tolerate
traitors
now
the
question
you
got
to
decide
is
this
will
you
take
the
risks
or
will
you
sell
out
and
leave
the
country
i
sell
out
replied
neuman
what
price
do
you
put
on
your
ranch
as
it
stands
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
dorn
turned
to
anderson
and
asked
is
it
worth
that
much
no
thousand
would
be
a
big
price
replied
the
rancher
neuman
we
will
give
you
thousand
for
your
holdings
do
you
accept
i
have
no
choice
replied
neuman
sullenly
choice
exclaimed
dorn
yes
you
have
and
you
not
being
cheated
i
stated
facts
you
are
done
in
this
valley
you
ruined
and
glidden
fate
stares
you
in
the
face
will
you
sell
and
leave
the
country
yes
came
the
deep
reply
wrenched
from
a
stubborn
breast
go
draw
up
your
deeds
then
notify
us
said
dorn
with
finality
jake
opened
the
door
stolidly
and
slowly
neuman
went
out
precisely
as
he
had
entered
like
a
huge
man
in
conflict
with
unintelligible
thoughts
send
him
home
in
the
car
called
anderson
chapter
xxiii
for
two
fleeting
days
lenore
anderson
was
happy
when
she
forgot
miserable
when
she
remembered
then
the
third
morning
dawned
at
the
her
father
had
said
cheerily
to
dorn
better
take
off
your
coat
an
come
out
to
the
fields
we
got
some
job
to
harvest
that
wheat
with
only
but
by
george
my
over
dorn
looked
suddenly
blank
as
if
anderson
cheery
words
had
recalled
him
to
the
realities
of
life
he
made
an
incoherent
excuse
and
left
the
table
anderson
characteristic
exclamation
might
have
meant
little
or
much
lenore
what
ails
the
boy
nothing
that
i
know
of
he
has
been
as
as
happy
as
i
am
she
replied
then
it
all
settled
father
i
i
kathleen
high
shrill
gleeful
voice
cut
in
sure
it
settled
look
at
lenorry
blush
lenore
indeed
felt
the
blood
stinging
face
and
neck
nevertheless
she
laughed
come
into
my
room
said
anderson
she
followed
him
there
and
as
he
closed
the
door
she
answered
his
questioning
look
by
running
into
his
arms
and
hiding
her
face
wal
i
be
the
rancher
ejaculated
with
emotion
he
held
her
and
patted
her
shoulder
with
his
big
hand
tell
me
lenore
there
little
to
tell
she
replied
softly
i
love
him
and
he
loves
me
so
so
well
that
i
been
madly
happy
in
spite
of
of
is
that
all
asked
anderson
dubiously
is
not
that
enough
but
dorn
lovin
you
so
well
does
say
he
not
go
to
war
and
it
was
then
that
forgotten
bitterness
returned
to
poison
cup
of
joy
ah
she
whispered
good
lord
lenore
you
do
mean
you
an
dorn
have
been
alone
all
the
time
these
few
days
an
you
have
settled
that
war
question
queried
anderson
in
amaze
yes
how
strange
but
since
well
since
something
happened
we
we
forgot
she
replied
dreamily
wal
go
back
to
it
said
anderson
forcibly
i
want
dorn
to
help
me
why
he
a
wonder
he
saved
the
situation
for
us
here
in
the
valley
every
rancher
i
know
is
praisin
him
high
an
he
sure
treated
neuman
square
an
here
i
am
with
three
big
on
my
hands
lenore
you
got
to
keep
him
home
dad
i
i
could
not
replied
lenore
she
was
strangely
realizing
an
indefinable
change
in
herself
i
ca
try
to
keep
him
from
going
to
war
i
never
thought
of
that
since
since
we
confessed
our
love
but
it
made
some
difference
it
kill
me
i
think
to
let
him
go
but
i
die
before
i
ask
him
to
stay
home
sighed
anderson
and
releasing
her
he
began
to
pace
the
room
i
do
begin
to
understand
you
girl
but
i
respect
your
feelin
it
a
hell
of
a
muddle
i
forgotten
the
war
myself
while
chasin
off
them
but
this
war
has
to
be
reckoned
with
send
dorn
to
me
lenore
found
dorn
playing
with
kathleen
these
two
had
become
as
brother
and
sister
kurt
dad
wants
to
see
you
said
lenore
seriously
dorn
looked
startled
and
the
light
of
fun
on
his
face
changed
to
a
sober
concern
you
told
him
yes
kurt
i
told
him
what
little
i
had
to
tell
he
gave
her
a
strange
glance
and
then
slowly
went
toward
her
study
lenore
made
a
futile
attempt
to
be
patient
she
heard
her
father
deep
voice
full
and
earnest
and
she
heard
dorn
quick
passionate
response
she
wondered
what
this
interview
meant
anderson
was
not
one
to
give
up
easily
he
had
set
his
heart
upon
holding
this
capable
young
man
in
the
great
interests
of
the
wheat
business
lenore
could
not
understand
why
she
was
not
praying
that
he
be
successful
but
she
was
not
it
was
inexplicable
and
puzzling
this
change
in
her
this
end
of
her
selfishness
yet
she
shrank
in
terror
from
an
impinging
sacrifice
she
thrust
the
thought
from
her
with
passionate
physical
gesture
and
with
stern
effort
of
will
dorn
was
closeted
with
her
father
for
over
an
hour
when
he
came
out
he
was
white
but
apparently
composed
lenore
had
never
seen
his
eyes
so
piercing
as
when
they
rested
upon
her
whew
he
exclaimed
and
wiped
his
face
your
father
has
my
poor
old
dad
what
does
kathleen
say
skinned
to
a
frazzle
what
did
he
say
asked
lenore
anxiously
a
lot
and
just
as
if
i
did
know
it
all
better
than
he
knows
replied
dorn
sadly
the
importance
of
wheat
his
three
ranches
and
nobody
to
run
them
his
growing
years
my
future
and
a
great
opportunity
as
one
of
the
big
wheat
men
of
the
northwest
the
present
need
of
the
government
his
only
son
gone
to
war
which
was
enough
for
his
family
and
then
he
spoke
of
you
heiress
to
waters
what
a
splendid
noble
girl
you
were
like
your
mother
what
a
shame
to
ruin
your
happiness
your
future
he
said
you
make
the
sweetest
of
wives
the
truest
of
mothers
oh
my
god
lenore
turned
away
her
face
shocked
to
her
heart
by
his
tragic
passion
dorn
was
silent
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
and
then
he
cussed
me
hard
as
no
doubt
i
deserved
added
dorn
but
what
did
you
say
she
whispered
i
said
a
lot
too
replied
dorn
remorsefully
did
did
you
began
lenore
and
broke
off
unable
to
finish
i
arrived
to
where
i
am
now
pretty
dizzy
he
responded
with
a
smile
that
was
both
radiant
and
sorrowful
he
took
her
hands
and
held
them
close
lenore
if
i
come
home
from
the
war
still
with
my
arms
and
legs
whole
will
you
marry
me
only
come
home
and
no
matter
what
you
lose
yes
yes
she
whispered
brokenly
but
it
a
conditional
proposal
lenore
he
insisted
you
must
never
marry
half
a
man
i
will
marry
she
cried
passionately
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
loved
him
all
the
more
every
moment
even
though
he
made
it
so
hard
for
her
then
through
blurred
dim
eyes
she
saw
him
take
something
from
his
pocket
and
felt
him
put
a
ring
on
her
finger
it
fits
is
that
lucky
he
said
softly
my
mother
ring
lenore
he
kissed
her
hand
kathleen
was
standing
near
them
and
in
an
ecstasy
of
realization
kathleen
your
sister
has
promised
to
marry
me
when
i
come
from
the
war
said
dorn
to
the
child
she
squealed
with
delight
and
manifestly
surrendering
to
a
temptation
she
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
hugged
him
close
it
perfectly
grand
she
cried
but
what
a
chump
you
are
for
going
at
all
when
you
could
marry
lenorry
that
was
kathleen
point
of
view
and
it
must
have
coincided
somewhat
with
anderson
kathleen
you
would
have
me
be
a
slacker
asked
dorn
gently
no
but
we
let
jim
go
was
her
argument
dorn
kissed
her
then
turned
to
lenore
let
go
out
to
the
fields
it
was
not
a
long
walk
to
the
alfalfa
but
by
the
time
she
got
there
lenore
impending
woe
was
as
if
it
had
never
been
dorn
seemed
strangely
gay
and
unusually
demonstrative
apparently
he
forgot
the
in
the
joy
of
the
hour
that
they
were
walking
in
the
open
seemed
not
to
matter
to
him
kurt
some
one
will
see
you
lenore
remonstrated
you
more
beautiful
than
ever
he
said
by
way
of
answer
and
tried
to
block
her
way
lenore
dodged
and
ran
she
was
fleet
and
eluded
him
down
the
lane
across
the
cut
field
to
a
huge
square
stack
of
baled
alfalfa
but
he
caught
her
just
as
she
got
behind
its
welcome
covert
lenore
was
far
less
afraid
of
him
than
of
laughing
eyes
breathless
she
backed
up
against
the
stack
you
a
cannibal
she
panted
but
she
did
not
make
much
resistance
you
a
goddess
he
replied
me
of
what
why
of
waters
goddess
of
wheat
the
sweet
waving
wheat
rich
and
golden
the
very
spirit
of
life
if
anybody
sees
you
mauling
me
this
way
i
not
seem
a
goddess
to
him
my
hair
is
down
my
waist
oh
kurt
yet
it
did
not
very
much
matter
how
she
looked
or
what
happened
beyond
all
was
the
assurance
of
her
dearness
to
him
suddenly
she
darted
away
from
him
again
her
heart
swelled
her
spirit
soared
her
feet
were
buoyant
and
swift
she
ran
into
the
uncut
alfalfa
it
was
thick
and
high
tangling
round
her
feet
here
her
progress
was
retarded
dorn
caught
up
with
her
his
strong
hands
on
her
shoulders
felt
masterful
and
the
sweet
terror
they
inspired
made
her
struggle
to
get
away
you
shall
not
hold
me
she
cried
but
i
will
you
must
be
taught
not
to
run
he
said
and
wrapped
her
tightly
in
his
arms
now
surrender
your
kisses
meekly
i
surrender
but
kurt
someone
will
see
dear
we
go
back
or
somewhere
who
can
see
us
here
but
the
birds
he
said
and
the
strong
hands
held
her
fast
you
will
kiss
me
enough
right
now
even
if
the
whole
world
looked
on
he
said
ringingly
lenore
my
soul
lenore
i
love
you
he
would
not
be
denied
and
if
she
had
any
desire
to
deny
him
it
was
lost
in
the
moment
she
clasped
his
neck
and
gave
him
kiss
for
kiss
but
her
surrender
made
him
think
of
her
she
felt
his
effort
to
let
her
go
lenore
heart
felt
too
big
for
her
breast
it
hurt
she
clung
to
his
hand
and
they
walked
on
across
the
field
and
across
a
brook
up
the
slope
to
one
of
lenore
favorite
seats
and
there
she
wanted
to
rest
she
smoothed
her
hair
and
brushed
her
dress
aware
of
how
he
watched
her
with
his
heart
in
his
eyes
had
there
ever
in
all
the
years
of
the
life
of
the
earth
been
so
perfect
a
day
how
dazzling
the
sun
what
heavenly
blue
the
sky
and
all
beneath
so
gold
so
green
a
lark
caroled
over
lenore
head
and
a
quail
whistled
in
the
brush
below
the
brook
babbled
and
gurgled
and
murmured
along
happy
under
the
open
sky
and
a
soft
breeze
brought
the
low
roar
of
the
harvest
fields
and
the
scent
of
wheat
and
dust
and
straw
life
seemed
so
stingingly
full
so
poignant
so
immeasurably
worth
living
so
blessed
with
beauty
and
richness
and
fruitfulness
lenore
your
eyes
are
windows
and
i
can
see
into
your
soul
i
can
read
and
first
i
uplifted
and
then
i
sad
it
was
he
who
talked
and
she
who
listened
this
glorious
day
would
be
her
strength
when
the
ah
but
she
would
not
complete
a
single
bitter
thought
she
led
him
away
up
the
slope
across
the
now
cut
and
harvested
to
the
great
swelling
golden
spaces
of
wheat
far
below
the
engines
and
harvesters
were
humming
here
the
wheat
waved
and
rustled
in
the
wind
it
was
as
high
as
lenore
head
it
fine
wheat
observed
dorn
but
the
wheat
of
my
desert
hills
was
richer
more
golden
and
higher
than
this
no
regrets
murmured
lenore
leaning
to
him
there
was
magic
in
those
words
the
same
enchantment
that
made
the
hours
fly
she
led
him
at
will
here
and
there
along
the
lanes
from
afar
they
watched
the
busy
harvest
scene
with
eyes
that
lingered
long
on
a
great
glittering
combine
with
its
horses
plodding
along
i
can
drive
them
horses
she
asserted
proudly
no
yes
will
you
come
i
will
show
you
it
is
a
temptation
he
said
with
a
sigh
but
there
are
eyes
there
they
would
break
the
spell
who
talking
about
eyes
now
she
cried
they
spent
the
remainder
of
that
day
on
the
windy
high
up
alone
with
the
beauty
and
richness
of
many
waters
beneath
them
and
when
the
sun
sent
its
last
ruddy
and
gold
rays
over
the
western
hills
and
the
weary
harvesters
plodded
homeward
lenore
still
lingered
loath
to
break
the
spell
for
on
the
way
home
she
divined
he
would
tell
her
he
was
soon
to
leave
sunset
and
evening
star
their
beauty
and
serenity
pervaded
soul
surely
there
was
a
life
somewhere
else
beyond
in
that
infinite
space
and
the
defeat
of
earthly
dreams
was
endurable
they
walked
back
down
the
wheat
lanes
hand
in
hand
as
dusk
shadowed
the
valley
and
when
they
reached
the
house
he
told
her
gently
that
he
must
go
but
you
will
stay
she
whispered
no
it
all
arranged
he
replied
thickly
they
to
drive
me
over
my
train
due
at
eight
i
kept
it
till
the
last
few
minutes
they
went
in
together
we
too
late
for
dinner
said
lenore
but
she
was
not
thinking
of
that
and
she
paused
with
head
bent
i
i
want
to
say
to
you
here
she
pointed
to
the
dim
curtained
entrance
of
the
i
like
that
too
he
replied
i
go
up
and
get
my
bag
wait
lenore
slowly
stepped
to
that
shadowed
spot
beyond
the
curtains
where
she
had
told
her
love
to
dorn
and
there
she
stood
praying
and
fighting
for
strength
to
let
him
go
for
power
to
conceal
her
pain
the
one
great
thing
she
could
do
was
to
show
him
that
she
would
not
stand
in
the
way
of
his
duty
to
himself
she
realized
then
that
if
he
had
told
her
sooner
if
he
were
going
to
remain
one
more
hour
at
many
waters
she
would
break
down
and
beseech
him
not
to
leave
her
she
saw
him
come
with
his
small
which
he
set
down
his
face
was
white
his
eyes
burned
but
her
woman
love
made
her
divine
that
this
was
not
a
shock
to
his
soul
as
it
was
to
hers
but
stimulation
a
man
strange
spiritual
accounting
to
his
he
went
first
into
the
and
lenore
heard
her
mother
and
sisters
voices
in
reply
to
his
presently
he
came
out
to
enter
her
father
study
lenore
listened
but
heard
no
sound
there
outside
a
creaked
and
hummed
by
the
window
to
stop
by
the
side
porch
then
the
door
of
her
father
study
opened
and
closed
and
dorn
came
to
where
she
was
standing
lenore
did
precisely
as
she
had
done
a
few
nights
before
when
she
had
changed
the
world
for
him
but
following
her
kiss
there
was
a
terrible
instant
when
with
her
arms
around
his
neck
she
went
blind
at
the
realization
of
loss
she
held
to
him
with
a
savage
intensity
of
possession
it
was
like
giving
up
life
she
knew
then
as
never
before
that
she
had
the
power
to
keep
him
at
her
side
but
a
thought
saved
her
from
exerting
it
the
thought
that
she
could
not
make
him
less
than
other
men
and
so
she
conquered
lenore
i
want
you
to
think
always
how
you
loved
me
he
said
loved
you
oh
my
boy
it
seems
your
lot
has
been
hard
toiled
you
lost
all
and
now
listen
he
interrupted
and
she
had
never
heard
his
voice
like
that
the
thousands
of
boys
who
go
to
fight
regard
it
a
duty
for
our
country
i
had
that
but
more
my
father
was
german
and
he
was
a
traitor
the
horror
for
me
is
that
i
hate
what
is
german
in
i
will
have
to
kill
that
but
you
helped
me
i
know
i
american
i
do
my
duty
whatever
it
is
i
would
have
gone
to
war
only
a
beast
with
my
soul
killed
before
i
ever
got
there
with
no
hope
no
possibility
of
return
but
you
love
me
ca
you
see
how
great
the
difference
lenore
understood
and
felt
it
in
his
happiness
yes
kurt
i
know
thank
god
i
helped
you
i
want
you
to
go
i
pray
always
i
believe
you
will
come
back
to
me
life
could
not
be
so
utterly
cruel
she
broke
off
life
ca
rob
me
now
nor
death
he
cried
in
exaltation
i
have
your
love
your
face
will
always
be
with
me
as
now
lovely
and
brave
not
a
tear
and
only
that
sweet
smile
like
an
angel
oh
lenore
what
a
girl
you
are
say
and
go
she
faltered
another
moment
would
see
her
weaken
yes
i
must
hurry
his
voice
was
a
whisper
almost
gone
he
drew
a
deep
breath
lenore
my
promised
wife
my
star
for
all
the
black
nights
god
bless
you
keep
you
she
spent
all
her
strength
in
her
embrace
all
her
soul
in
the
passion
of
her
farewell
kiss
then
she
stood
alone
tottering
sinking
the
swift
steps
now
heavy
and
uneven
passed
out
of
the
hall
the
door
closed
the
creaked
and
rolled
away
the
droning
hum
ceased
for
a
moment
of
despairing
shock
before
the
storm
broke
lenore
blindly
wavered
there
unable
to
move
from
the
spot
that
had
seen
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
her
brief
hour
of
love
then
she
summoned
strength
to
drag
herself
to
her
room
to
lock
her
door
alone
in
the
merciful
darkness
and
silence
and
loneliness
she
need
not
lie
nor
play
false
nor
fool
herself
here
she
had
let
him
go
inconceivable
and
monstrous
truth
for
what
it
was
not
now
with
her
that
deceiving
spirit
which
had
made
her
brave
but
she
was
a
woman
she
fell
upon
her
knees
beside
her
bed
shuddering
that
moment
was
the
beginning
of
her
sacrifice
the
sacrifice
she
shared
in
common
now
with
thousands
of
other
women
before
she
had
pitied
now
she
suffered
and
all
that
was
sweet
loving
noble
and
motherly
all
that
was
womanly
rose
to
meet
the
stretch
of
gray
future
with
its
endless
suspense
and
torturing
fear
its
face
of
courage
for
the
light
of
day
its
despair
for
the
lonely
night
and
its
vague
faith
in
the
lessons
of
life
its
possible
and
sustaining
and
eternal
hope
of
god

xxiv
camp
dear
sister
lenore
it
been
long
since
i
wrote
you
i
sorry
dear
but
i
have
just
been
in
shape
to
write
have
been
transferred
to
a
not
far
from
new
york
i
do
like
it
the
air
is
raw
penetrating
different
from
our
high
mountain
air
in
the
west
so
many
gray
gloomy
days
and
wet
why
you
never
saw
a
rain
in
washington
fine
bunch
of
boys
though
we
get
up
in
the
morning
at
sweep
the
streets
of
the
camp
i
glad
to
get
up
and
sweep
for
i
near
frozen
long
before
daylight
yesterday
i
peeled
potatoes
till
my
hands
were
cramped
nine
million
spuds
i
guess
i
wearing
citizen
clothes
too
thin
by
gosh
and
sleeping
in
a
tent
on
a
canvas
cot
with
one
blanket
would
care
a
scoose
me
sis
i
would
mind
if
i
had
a
real
gun
and
some
real
fighting
to
look
forward
to
some
life
i
do
think
but
i
meant
to
tell
you
why
i
here
you
remember
how
i
always
took
to
cowboys
well
i
got
chummy
with
a
big
cow
puncher
from
montana
his
name
was
andersen
is
that
queer
his
name
same
as
mine
except
for
the
last
e
where
i
have
o
he
a
swede
or
norwegian
american
well
i
should
smile
like
all
cowboys
he
six
feet
four
broad
as
a
door
with
a
flat
head
of
an
indian
and
a
huge
bulging
chin
not
real
handsome
but
say
he
one
of
the
finest
fellows
that
ever
lived
we
call
him
montana
there
were
a
lot
of
in
our
outfit
and
right
away
i
got
in
bad
you
know
i
never
was
much
on
holding
my
temper
anyway
i
got
licked
powerful
fine
as
dad
would
say
and
i
been
all
beaten
up
but
for
montana
that
made
us
two
fast
friends
and
sure
some
enemies
you
bet
we
had
the
tough
luck
to
run
into
six
of
the
just
outside
of
the
little
town
where
they
been
drinking
i
never
heard
the
name
of
one
of
that
outfit
we
were
acquainted
at
all
strange
how
they
changed
my
soldier
career
right
at
the
start
this
day
when
we
met
them
they
got
fresh
and
of
course
i
had
to
start
something
i
soaked
that
sis
and
do
you
forget
it
well
it
was
a
fight
sure
i
got
laid
out
not
knocked
out
for
i
could
see
but
i
was
any
help
to
pard
montana
it
looked
as
if
he
did
need
any
the
jumped
him
then
one
after
another
he
piled
them
up
in
the
road
just
a
swing
and
down
went
each
one
cold
but
the
fellow
i
hit
came
to
and
grabbing
up
a
with
all
his
might
he
soaked
montana
over
the
head
what
an
awful
crack
montana
went
down
and
there
was
blood
everywhere
they
took
montana
to
the
hospital
sewed
up
his
head
it
was
long
before
he
seemed
all
right
again
but
he
told
me
sometimes
he
felt
queer
then
they
put
us
on
a
with
boys
from
california
and
all
over
and
we
came
east
i
have
seen
any
of
those
other
western
boys
though
since
we
got
here
one
day
without
any
warning
montana
keeled
over
down
and
out
paralysis
they
took
him
to
a
hospital
in
new
york
no
hope
the
doctors
said
and
he
was
getting
worse
all
the
time
but
some
new
york
surgeon
advised
operation
anyway
so
they
opened
that
place
in
his
head
where
the
hit
and
what
do
you
think
they
found
a
splinter
off
that
stuck
two
inches
under
his
skull
in
his
brain
they
took
it
out
every
day
they
expected
montana
to
die
but
he
did
but
he
die
i
went
over
to
see
him
he
unconscious
part
of
the
time
crazy
the
rest
no
part
of
his
right
side
moves
it
broke
me
all
up
why
could
that
soak
he
got
have
been
on
the
kaiser
head
i
tell
you
lenore
a
fellow
has
his
eye
teeth
cut
in
this
getting
ready
to
go
to
war
it
makes
me
sick
i
enlisted
to
fight
not
to
be
chased
into
a
climate
that
does
agree
with
me
not
to
sweep
roads
and
juggle
a
wooden
gun
there
are
a
lot
of
things
but
say
got
to
cut
out
that
kind
of
talk
i
feel
almost
as
far
away
from
you
all
as
if
i
were
in
china
but
i
nearer
france
i
hope
you
well
and
standing
pat
lenore
remember
you
dad
white
hope
i
was
the
black
sheep
you
know
tell
him
i
do
regard
my
transfer
as
a
disgrace
the
officers
did
and
he
need
give
my
love
to
mother
and
the
girls
tell
them
not
to
worry
maybe
the
war
will
be
over
before
i
write
you
often
now
so
cheer
up
your
loving
brother
jim
camp
my
dearest
lenore
if
my
writing
is
not
very
legible
it
is
because
my
hand
shakes
when
i
begin
this
sweet
and
sacred
privilege
of
writing
to
my
promised
wife
my
other
letter
was
short
and
this
is
the
second
in
the
weeks
since
i
left
you
what
an
endless
time
you
must
understand
and
forgive
me
for
not
writing
oftener
and
for
not
giving
you
definite
address
i
did
not
want
to
be
in
the
western
regiment
for
reasons
hard
to
understand
i
enlisted
in
new
york
and
am
trying
hard
to
get
into
the
rainbow
division
with
some
hope
of
success
there
is
nothing
to
me
in
being
a
member
of
a
crack
regiment
but
it
seems
that
this
one
will
see
action
first
of
all
american
units
i
do
want
to
be
an
officer
either
how
will
it
be
possible
for
me
to
write
you
as
i
want
to
letters
that
will
be
free
of
the
plague
of
myself
letters
that
you
can
treasure
if
i
never
come
back
sleeping
and
waking
i
never
forget
the
wonderful
truth
of
your
love
for
me
it
did
not
seem
real
when
i
was
with
you
but
now
that
we
are
separated
i
know
that
it
is
real
mostly
my
mind
contains
only
two
things
this
constant
memory
of
you
and
that
other
terrible
thing
of
which
i
will
not
speak
all
else
that
i
think
or
do
seems
to
be
mechanical
the
work
the
training
is
not
difficult
for
me
though
so
many
boys
find
it
desperately
hard
you
know
i
followed
a
plow
and
that
is
real
toil
right
now
i
see
the
brown
fallow
hills
and
the
great
squares
of
gold
but
visions
or
thoughts
of
home
are
rare
that
is
well
for
they
hurt
like
a
stab
i
can
not
think
now
of
a
single
thing
connected
with
my
training
here
that
i
want
to
tell
you
yet
some
things
i
must
tell
for
instance
we
have
different
instructors
and
naturally
some
are
more
forcible
than
others
we
have
one
at
whom
the
boys
laugh
he
tickles
them
they
like
him
but
he
is
an
ordeal
for
me
the
reason
is
that
in
our
first
bayonet
practice
when
we
rushed
and
thrust
a
stuffed
bag
he
made
us
yell
god
damn
you
german
die
i
do
imagine
this
to
be
general
practice
in
army
exercises
but
the
fact
is
he
started
us
that
way
i
ca
forget
when
i
begin
to
charge
with
a
bayonet
those
words
leap
silently
but
terribly
to
my
lips
think
of
this
as
reality
lenore
a
sad
and
incomprehensible
truth
in
all
in
me
that
is
spiritual
reasonable
all
that
was
once
hopeful
revolts
at
this
actuality
and
its
meaning
but
there
is
another
side
that
dark
one
which
revels
in
anticipation
it
is
the
in
me
hiding
by
night
waiting
with
a
bludgeon
to
slay
i
am
beginning
to
be
struck
by
the
gradual
change
in
my
comrades
i
fancied
that
i
alone
had
suffered
a
retrogression
i
have
a
deep
consciousness
of
baseness
that
is
going
to
keep
me
aloof
from
them
i
seem
to
be
alone
with
my
own
soul
yet
i
seem
to
be
abnormally
keen
to
impressions
i
feel
what
is
going
on
in
the
soldiers
minds
and
it
shocks
me
set
me
wondering
forces
me
to
doubt
myself
i
keep
saying
it
must
be
my
peculiar
way
of
looking
at
things
lenore
i
remember
your
appeal
to
me
shall
i
ever
forget
your
sweet
face
your
sad
eyes
when
you
bade
me
hope
in
god
i
am
trying
but
i
do
not
see
god
yet
perhaps
that
is
because
of
my
morbidness
my
limitations
perhaps
i
will
face
him
over
there
when
i
go
down
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
one
thing
however
i
do
begin
to
see
is
that
there
is
a
divinity
in
men
slowly
something
divine
is
revealing
itself
to
me
to
give
up
work
property
friends
sister
mother
home
sweetheart
to
sacrifice
all
and
go
out
to
fight
for
country
for
honor
that
indeed
is
divine
it
is
beautiful
it
inspires
a
man
and
lifts
his
head
but
alas
if
he
is
a
thinking
man
when
he
comes
in
contact
with
the
actual
physical
preparation
for
war
he
finds
that
the
divinity
was
the
hour
of
his
sacrifice
and
that
to
become
a
good
soldier
he
must
change
forget
grow
hard
strong
merciless
brutal
humorous
and
callous
all
of
which
is
to
say
base
i
see
boys
who
are
who
love
life
who
were
born
sufferers
who
can
not
inflict
pain
how
many
silent
cries
of
protest
of
wonder
of
agony
must
go
up
in
the
night
over
this
camp
the
sum
of
them
would
be
monstrous
the
sound
of
them
if
voiced
would
be
a
clarion
blast
to
the
world
it
is
sacrifice
that
is
divine
and
not
the
making
of
an
efficient
soldier
i
shall
write
you
endlessly
the
action
of
writing
relieves
me
i
feel
less
burdened
now
sometimes
i
can
not
bear
the
burden
of
all
this
unintelligible
consciousness
my
mind
is
not
large
enough
sometimes
i
feel
that
i
am
going
to
be
every
soldier
and
every
enemy
each
one
in
his
strife
or
his
drifting
or
his
agony
or
his
death
but
despite
that
feeling
i
seem
alone
in
a
horde
i
make
no
friends
i
have
no
way
to
pass
my
leisure
but
writing
i
can
hardly
read
at
all
when
off
duty
the
boys
amuse
themselves
in
a
hundred
ways
going
to
town
the
theaters
and
movies
chasing
the
girls
especially
that
to
judge
by
their
talk
play
boxing
games
and
i
am
sorry
to
add
many
of
them
gamble
and
drink
but
i
can
not
do
any
of
these
things
i
can
not
forget
what
i
am
here
for
i
can
not
forget
that
i
am
training
to
kill
men
never
do
i
forget
that
soon
i
will
face
death
what
a
terrible
strange
vague
thrill
that
sends
shivering
over
me
amusement
and
forgetfulness
are
past
for
kurt
dorn
i
am
concerned
with
my
soul
i
am
fighting
that
black
passion
which
makes
of
me
a
sleepless
watcher
and
thinker
if
this
war
only
lets
me
live
long
enough
to
understand
its
meaning
perhaps
that
meaning
will
be
the
meaning
of
life
in
which
case
i
am
longing
for
the
unattainable
but
underneath
it
all
must
be
a
colossal
movement
of
evolution
of
spiritual
growth
or
of
retrogression
who
knows
when
i
ask
myself
what
i
am
going
to
fight
for
i
answer
for
my
country
as
a
patriot
for
my
hate
as
an
individual
my
time
is
almost
up
i
go
on
duty
the
rain
is
roaring
on
the
thin
roof
how
it
rains
in
this
east
whole
days
and
nights
it
pours
i
can
not
help
but
think
of
my
desert
hills
always
so
barren
and
yellow
with
the
whirling
one
day
of
this
rain
useless
and
wasted
here
would
have
saved
the
bend
crop
of
wheat
nature
is
almost
as
inscrutable
as
god
lenore
for
this
time
think
of
me
but
not
as
lonely
or
unhappy
or
uncomfortable
out
there
in
the
cold
raw
black
wet
night
i
will
be
neither
some
one
a
spirit
will
keep
beside
me
as
i
step
the
beat
i
have
put
unhappiness
behind
me
and
no
rain
or
mud
or
chill
will
ever
feaze
me
yours
with
love
kurt
dorn
camp
dear
sister
lenore
after
that
little
letter
of
yours
i
could
do
nothing
more
than
look
up
another
pin
like
the
one
i
sent
kathleen
i
inclose
it
hope
you
will
wear
it
i
very
curious
to
see
what
your
package
contains
it
arrived
yet
all
the
mail
comes
late
that
makes
the
boys
sore
the
weather
has
been
so
wet
lately
as
when
i
last
wrote
but
colder
believe
me
these
tents
are
not
but
we
grin
and
try
to
look
happy
it
not
the
most
cheerful
thing
to
hear
the
old
call
in
the
morning
and
tumble
out
in
the
cold
gray
dawn
say
got
two
blankets
now
just
time
for
mess
then
we
hike
down
the
road
i
in
for
artillery
now
i
guess
the
air
service
really
fascinated
me
but
you
ca
have
what
you
want
in
this
business
this
letter
will
be
in
sections
no
use
sending
you
a
little
dab
of
news
now
and
then
i
write
when
i
can
and
mail
when
the
letter
assumes
real
proportions
your
package
arrived
and
i
was
delighted
i
think
i
slept
better
last
night
on
your
little
pillow
than
any
night
since
we
were
called
out
my
pillow
before
was
your
sleeveless
jersey
it
after
three
and
i
on
guard
that
is
battery
guard
and
i
have
to
be
up
from
midnight
to
reveille
not
on
a
post
but
in
my
tent
so
that
if
any
of
my
men
i
a
corporal
now
whom
i
relieve
every
two
hours
get
into
trouble
they
can
call
me
go
on
guard
once
in
six
days
so
about
every
sixth
night
i
get
along
with
no
sleep
we
have
been
ordered
to
do
away
with
all
personal
property
except
shaving
outfit
and
absolutely
necessary
articles
we
ca
keep
a
trunk
valise
or
even
an
ordinary
in
our
tents
everything
must
be
put
in
one
barrack
bag
a
canvas
sack
just
like
a
thank
the
girls
for
the
silk
handkerchief
and
candy
they
sent
i
sure
have
the
sweetest
sisters
of
any
boy
i
know
i
never
appreciated
them
when
i
had
them
i
learning
bitter
truths
these
days
and
tell
mother
i
write
her
soon
thank
her
for
the
pajamas
and
the
napkins
tell
her
i
sorry
a
soldier
has
no
use
for
either
this
morning
i
did
my
washing
of
the
past
two
weeks
and
i
was
so
busy
that
i
did
hear
the
bugle
blow
and
thereby
got
on
the
black
book
which
means
that
i
wo
get
any
time
off
soon
before
i
forget
lenore
let
me
tell
you
that
i
taken
ten
thousand
dollars
life
insurance
from
the
government
in
your
favor
as
beneficiary
this
costs
me
only
about
six
and
a
half
dollars
per
month
and
in
case
of
my
death
well
i
a
soldier
now
please
tell
rose
i
taken
a
liberty
bond
of
the
new
issue
for
her
this
i
paying
at
the
rate
of
five
dollars
per
month
and
it
will
be
delivered
to
her
at
the
end
of
ten
months
both
of
these
of
course
i
paying
out
of
my
government
pay
as
a
soldier
the
money
dad
sent
me
i
spent
like
water
lent
to
the
boys
threw
away
tell
him
not
to
send
me
any
more
tell
him
the
time
has
come
for
jim
anderson
to
make
good
i
a
rich
dad
and
he
the
best
dad
any
boy
ever
had
i
going
to
prove
more
than
one
thing
this
trip
we
hear
so
many
rumors
and
none
of
them
ever
come
true
one
of
them
is
funny
that
we
have
so
many
rich
men
with
political
influence
in
our
regiment
that
we
will
never
get
to
france
is
that
the
limit
but
it
funny
because
if
we
have
rich
men
i
like
to
see
them
still
there
are
thirty
thousand
soldiers
here
and
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
such
rumors
are
laughed
and
cussed
at
we
hear
also
that
we
going
to
be
ordered
south
i
wish
that
would
come
true
so
cold
and
drab
and
muddy
and
monotonous
my
friend
montana
fooled
everybody
he
did
die
he
seems
to
be
hanging
on
lately
he
recovered
consciousness
told
me
he
had
no
feeling
on
his
left
side
except
sometimes
his
hand
itched
you
know
like
prickly
needles
but
montana
will
never
be
any
good
again
that
fine
big
cowboy
he
been
one
grand
soldier
it
sickens
me
sometimes
to
think
of
the
difference
between
what
thrilled
me
about
this
war
game
and
what
we
get
maybe
though
there
goes
my
call
i
must
close
love
to
all
jim
new
york
city
dearest
lenore
it
seems
about
time
that
i
had
a
letter
from
you
i
sure
letters
are
on
the
way
but
they
do
not
come
quickly
the
boys
complain
of
the
mail
service
is
it
strange
that
there
is
not
a
soul
to
write
me
except
you
jeff
my
will
write
me
whenever
i
write
him
which
i
have
done
yet
i
on
duty
here
in
new
york
at
an
armory
bazaar
it
certainly
the
irony
of
fate
why
did
the
officer
pick
on
me
i
like
to
know
but
i
never
complained
of
an
order
so
far
and
i
standing
it
several
of
us
and
they
chose
the
husky
boys
have
been
sent
over
here
for
absolutely
no
purpose
that
i
can
see
except
to
exhibit
ourselves
in
uniform
it
a
woman
bazaar
to
raise
money
for
work
and
so
on
the
hall
is
almost
as
large
as
that
field
back
of
your
house
and
every
night
it
is
packed
with
people
mostly
young
my
comrades
are
having
fun
out
of
it
but
i
feel
like
a
fish
out
of
water
just
the
same
lenore
i
learning
more
every
day
if
i
was
not
so
disgusted
i
think
this
was
a
wonderful
opportunity
as
it
is
i
regard
it
only
as
an
experience
over
which
i
have
no
control
and
that
interests
me
in
spite
of
myself
new
york
is
an
awful
place
endless
narrow
streets
crowded
with
hurrying
throngs
taxicabs
cars
and
full
of
noise
and
dust
i
am
always
choked
for
air
and
these
streets
reek
where
do
the
people
come
from
and
where
are
they
going
they
look
wild
as
if
they
had
to
go
somewhere
but
did
not
know
where
that
was
i
no
time
or
inclination
to
see
new
york
though
under
happier
circumstances
i
think
i
like
to
people
in
the
east
seem
strange
to
me
still
as
i
never
mingled
with
many
people
in
the
west
i
can
not
say
truly
whether
eastern
people
are
different
from
western
people
but
i
think
so
anyway
while
i
was
in
spokane
portland
san
francisco
and
los
angeles
i
did
not
think
people
were
greatly
concerned
about
the
war
denver
people
appeared
not
to
realize
there
was
a
war
but
here
in
new
york
everything
is
war
you
ca
escape
it
you
see
that
war
will
soon
obsess
rich
and
poor
alien
and
neutral
and
belligerent
pacifist
and
militarist
since
i
wrote
you
last
i
tried
to
read
the
newspapers
sent
to
us
it
hard
to
tell
you
which
makes
me
the
sicker
the
prattle
of
the
pacifist
or
the
mathematics
of
the
military
experts
both
miss
the
spirit
of
men
neither
has
any
soul
i
think
the
german
minds
must
all
be
mathematical
but
i
want
to
write
about
the
women
and
girls
i
see
here
in
new
york
in
the
camps
and
towns
on
the
trains
everywhere
lenore
the
war
has
thrown
them
off
their
balance
i
have
seen
and
studied
at
close
hand
women
of
all
classes
believe
me
as
the
boys
say
i
have
thought
more
than
twice
whether
or
not
i
would
tell
you
the
stark
truth
but
somehow
i
am
impelled
to
i
have
an
overwhelming
conviction
that
all
american
girls
and
mothers
should
know
what
the
truth
is
they
will
never
be
told
lenore
and
most
would
never
believe
if
they
were
told
and
that
is
one
thing
wrong
with
people
i
believe
every
soldier
from
the
time
he
enlists
until
the
war
is
ended
should
be
kept
away
from
women
this
is
a
sweeping
statement
and
you
must
take
into
account
the
mind
of
him
who
makes
it
but
i
am
not
leaping
at
conclusions
the
soldier
boys
have
terrible
peril
facing
them
long
before
they
get
to
the
trenches
not
all
or
nearly
all
the
soldiers
are
going
to
be
vitally
affected
by
the
rottenness
of
great
cities
or
by
the
mushroom
hotbeds
of
vice
springing
up
near
the
camps
these
evils
exist
and
are
being
opposed
by
military
and
government
by
police
and
and
good
influence
of
good
people
but
they
will
never
wholly
stamp
it
out
nor
do
i
want
to
say
much
about
the
society
women
who
are
rushing
the
officers
there
may
be
one
here
and
there
with
her
heart
in
the
right
place
but
with
most
of
them
it
must
be
first
this
something
about
war
that
has
unbalanced
women
and
secondly
a
fad
a
novelty
a
new
sentimental
stunt
a
fashion
set
by
some
leader
likewise
i
want
to
say
but
little
about
the
horde
of
common
women
and
girls
who
lie
in
wait
for
soldiers
at
every
corner
so
to
speak
all
these
to
be
sure
may
be
unconsciously
actuated
by
motives
that
do
not
appear
on
the
surface
and
if
this
be
true
their
actions
are
less
bold
less
raw
than
they
look
what
i
want
to
dwell
upon
is
my
impression
of
something
strange
unbalanced
incomprehensible
about
the
frank
conduct
of
so
many
refined
and
good
women
i
see
and
about
the
eagerness
restlessness
the
singular
response
of
nice
girls
to
situations
that
are
not
natural
a
handsome
stylishly
gowned
woman
of
about
thirty
came
up
to
me
with
a
radiant
smile
and
a
strange
brightness
in
her
eyes
there
were
five
hundred
couples
dancing
on
the
floor
and
the
music
and
sound
of
sliding
feet
made
it
difficult
to
hear
her
she
said
you
handsome
soldier
boy
come
dance
with
me
i
replied
politely
that
i
did
not
dance
then
she
took
hold
of
me
and
said
i
teach
you
i
saw
a
on
the
hand
she
laid
on
my
arm
then
i
looked
straight
at
her
madam
very
soon
i
be
learning
the
dance
of
death
over
in
france
and
my
mind
concerned
with
that
she
grew
red
with
anger
she
seemed
amazed
and
she
snapped
well
you
a
queer
soldier
later
i
watched
her
flirting
and
dancing
with
an
officer
overtures
and
advances
innumerable
have
been
made
to
me
ranging
from
the
assured
onslaught
like
this
woman
to
the
slight
subtle
something
felt
more
than
seen
of
a
more
complex
nature
and
lenore
i
blush
to
tell
you
this
but
i
been
mobbed
by
girls
they
have
a
thousand
ways
of
letting
a
soldier
i
could
not
begin
to
tell
them
but
i
do
not
actually
realize
what
it
is
that
is
conveyed
that
i
know
and
i
am
positive
the
very
large
majority
of
soldiers
at
night
i
listen
to
the
talks
of
my
comrades
and
well
if
the
girls
only
heard
many
times
i
go
out
of
hearing
and
when
i
can
not
do
that
i
refuse
to
hear
lenore
i
am
talking
about
nice
girls
now
i
am
merciless
there
are
many
girls
like
you
they
seem
like
you
though
none
so
pretty
i
mean
you
know
there
are
certain
manners
and
distinctions
that
at
once
mark
a
really
nice
girl
for
a
month
i
been
thrown
here
and
there
so
that
it
seems
i
seen
as
many
girls
as
soldiers
i
have
been
sent
to
different
entertainments
given
for
soldiers
at
one
place
a
woman
got
up
and
invited
the
girls
to
ask
the
boys
to
dance
at
another
a
crowd
of
girls
were
lined
up
wearing
different
ribbons
and
the
boys
marched
along
until
each
one
found
the
girl
wearing
a
ribbon
to
match
the
one
he
wore
that
was
his
partner
it
was
interesting
to
see
the
eager
mischievous
brooding
eyes
of
these
girls
as
they
watched
and
waited
just
as
interesting
was
it
to
see
this
boy
face
when
he
found
his
partner
was
ugly
and
that
boy
swell
with
pride
when
he
found
he
had
picked
a
winner
it
was
all
adventure
for
both
boys
and
girls
but
i
saw
more
than
that
in
it
whenever
i
could
not
avoid
meeting
a
girl
i
tried
to
be
agreeable
and
to
talk
about
war
and
soldiers
and
what
was
going
on
i
did
not
dance
of
course
and
i
imagine
more
than
one
girl
found
me
a
queer
soldier
it
always
has
touched
me
though
to
see
and
feel
the
sweetness
graciousness
sympathy
kindness
and
that
other
indefinable
something
in
the
girls
i
have
met
how
they
made
me
think
of
you
lenore
no
doubt
about
their
hearts
their
loyalty
their
americanism
every
soldier
who
goes
to
france
can
fight
for
some
girl
they
make
you
feel
that
i
believe
i
have
gone
deeper
than
most
soldiers
in
considering
what
i
will
call
of
the
sexes
if
it
is
normal
then
underneath
it
all
is
a
tremendous
inscrutable
design
of
nature
or
god
if
that
be
true
actually
true
then
war
must
be
inevitable
and
right
how
horrible
my
thoughts
confound
me
sometimes
anyway
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
this
i
heard
an
officer
tell
an
irate
father
whose
two
daughters
had
been
insulted
by
soldiers
my
dear
sir
it
is
regrettable
these
men
will
be
punished
but
they
are
not
greatly
to
blame
because
so
many
girls
throw
themselves
at
their
heads
your
daughters
did
not
of
course
but
they
should
not
have
come
here
that
illustrates
the
fixed
idea
of
the
military
all
through
the
ranks
throw
themselves
at
soldiers
it
is
true
that
they
do
but
the
idea
is
false
nevertheless
because
the
mass
of
girls
are
misunderstood
misunderstood
i
can
tell
you
why
surely
the
mass
of
american
girls
are
nice
fine
sweet
wholesome
they
are
young
the
news
of
war
liberates
something
in
them
that
we
can
find
no
name
for
but
it
must
be
noble
a
soldier
the
very
name
from
childhood
is
one
to
make
a
girl
thrill
what
then
the
actual
thing
the
uniform
invested
somehow
with
chivalry
and
courage
the
athletic
young
man
somber
and
fascinating
with
his
intent
eyes
his
serious
brow
or
his
gallantry
the
compelling
presence
of
him
that
breathes
of
his
sacrifice
of
his
near
departure
to
privation
to
squalid
comfortless
trenches
to
the
fire
and
hell
of
war
to
blood
and
agony
and
death
in
a
word
to
fight
fight
fight
for
women
so
through
this
beautiful
emotion
women
lose
their
balance
and
many
are
misunderstood
those
who
would
not
and
could
not
be
bold
are
susceptible
to
advances
that
in
an
ordinary
time
would
not
affect
them
war
invests
a
soldier
with
a
glamour
love
at
first
sight
flirtations
rash
intimacies
quick
engagements
immediate
marriages
the
soldier
who
is
soon
going
away
to
fight
and
perhaps
to
die
strikes
hard
at
the
very
heart
of
a
girl
either
she
is
not
her
real
self
then
or
else
she
is
suddenly
transported
to
a
womanhood
that
is
instinctive
elemental
universal
for
the
future
she
feels
what
she
does
not
know
she
surrenders
because
there
is
an
imperative
call
to
the
depths
of
her
nature
she
sacrifices
because
she
is
the
inspiritor
of
the
soldier
the
reward
for
his
loss
the
savior
of
the
race
if
women
are
the
spoils
of
barbarous
conquerors
they
are
also
the
sinews
the
strength
the
soul
of
defenders
and
so
however
you
look
at
it
war
means
for
women
sacrifice
disillusion
heartbreak
agony
doom
i
feel
that
so
powerfully
that
i
am
overcome
i
am
sick
at
the
gaiety
and
playing
i
am
full
of
fear
wonder
admiration
and
hopeless
pity
for
them
no
man
can
tell
what
is
going
on
in
the
souls
of
soldiers
while
noble
women
are
offering
love
and
tenderness
throwing
themselves
upon
the
altar
of
war
hoping
blindly
to
send
their
great
spirits
marching
to
the
front
perhaps
the
man
who
lives
through
the
war
will
feel
the
change
in
his
soul
if
he
can
not
tell
it
day
by
day
i
think
i
see
a
change
in
my
comrades
as
they
grow
physically
stronger
they
seem
to
grow
spiritually
lesser
but
maybe
that
is
only
my
idea
i
see
evidences
of
fear
anger
sullenness
moodiness
shame
i
see
a
growing
indifference
to
fatigue
toil
pain
as
these
boys
harden
physically
they
harden
mentally
always
off
there
is
the
war
and
that
seems
closely
related
to
the
near
duty
here
what
it
takes
to
make
a
man
these
fellows
will
measure
men
differently
after
this
experience
with
sacrifice
obedience
labor
and
pain
in
that
they
will
become
great
but
i
do
not
think
these
things
stimulate
a
man
mind
changes
are
going
on
in
me
some
of
which
i
am
unable
to
define
for
instance
physically
i
am
much
bigger
and
stronger
than
i
was
i
weigh
one
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
as
for
my
mind
something
is
always
tugging
at
it
i
feel
that
it
grows
tired
it
wants
to
forget
in
spite
of
my
will
all
of
these
keen
desires
of
mine
to
know
everything
lag
and
fail
often
and
i
catch
myself
drifting
i
see
and
feel
and
hear
without
thinking
i
am
only
an
animal
then
at
these
times
sight
of
blood
or
a
fight
or
a
plunging
horse
or
a
broken
leg
and
these
sights
are
common
affects
me
little
until
i
am
quickened
and
think
about
the
meaning
of
it
all
at
such
moments
i
have
a
revulsion
of
feeling
with
memory
comes
a
revolt
and
so
on
until
i
am
the
distressed
inquisitive
and
morbid
person
i
am
now
i
shudder
at
what
war
will
make
me
actual
contact
with
earth
exploding
guns
fighting
comrades
striking
foes
will
make
brutes
of
us
all
it
is
wrong
to
shed
another
man
blood
if
life
was
meant
for
that
why
do
we
have
progress
i
can
not
reconcile
a
god
with
all
this
horror
i
have
misgivings
about
my
mind
if
i
feel
so
acutely
here
in
safety
and
comfort
what
shall
i
feel
over
there
in
peril
and
agony
i
fear
i
shall
laugh
at
death
oh
lenore
consider
that
to
laugh
in
the
ghastly
face
of
death
if
i
yield
utterly
to
a
fiendish
joy
of
bloody
combat
then
my
mind
will
fail
and
that
in
itself
would
be
evidence
of
god
i
do
not
read
over
my
letters
to
you
i
just
write
forgive
me
if
they
are
not
happier
every
hour
i
think
of
you
at
night
i
see
your
face
in
the
shadow
of
the
tent
wall
and
i
love
you
unutterably
faithfully
kurt
dorn
camp

sister

for
you

a
chill
that
lasted
for
fifteen
minutes
i

like
a
leaf

left
me
and
then
i
got
a
terrible
pain
in
my
side
but
i
did
give
in
which
i
feel
now
was
a
mistake
i
stayed
up
till
i
dropped

here
in
the
hospital

a
long
shed
with
three
stoves
and
a
lot
of
beds
with
other
sick
boys

more
lines

and
dismal

fellow

weight
on

chest

pain
that
moan
of
wind
makes
me
feel
so
lonely

lot
about
you
girls
and
mother
and
dad
tell
dad
i
made
good
jim
chapter
xxv
jim
last
letter
was
not
taken
seriously
by
the
other
members
of
the
anderson
family
the
father
shook
his
head
dubiously
that
ai
like
jim
but
made
no
other
comment
anderson
sighed
the
young
sisters
were
not
given
to
worry
lenore
however
was
haunted
by
an
unwritten
meaning
in
her
brother
letter
weeks
before
she
had
written
to
dorn
and
told
him
to
hunt
up
jim
no
reply
had
yet
come
from
dorn
every
day
augmented
her
uneasiness
until
it
was
dreadful
to
look
for
letters
that
did
not
come
all
this
fortified
her
however
to
expect
calamity
like
a
bolt
out
of
the
clear
sky
it
came
in
the
shape
of
a
telegram
from
camp
saying
that
jim
was
dying
the
shock
prostrated
the
mother
jim
had
been
her
favorite
anderson
left
at
once
for
the
east
lenore
had
the
care
of
her
mother
and
the
management
of
many
waters
on
her
hands
which
duties
kept
her
mercifully
occupied
anderson
however
after
a
day
rallied
surprisingly
lenore
sensed
in
her
mother
the
strength
of
the
spirit
that
sacrificed
to
a
noble
and
universal
cause
it
seemed
to
be
anderson
conviction
that
jim
had
been
shot
or
injured
by
accident
in
or
at
least
by
a
horse
lenore
did
not
share
her
idea
and
was
reluctant
to
dispel
it
on
the
evening
of
the
fifth
day
after
anderson
departure
a
message
came
saying
that
he
had
arrived
too
late
to
see
jim
alive
anderson
bore
the
news
bravely
though
she
weakened
perceptibly
the
family
waited
then
for
further
news
none
came
day
after
day
passed
then
one
evening
while
lenore
strolled
in
the
gloaming
kathleen
came
running
to
burst
out
with
the
announcement
of
their
father
arrival
he
had
telephoned
from
vale
for
a
car
to
meet
him
not
long
after
that
lenore
who
had
gone
to
her
room
heard
the
return
of
the
car
and
recognized
her
father
voice
she
ran
down
in
time
to
see
him
being
embraced
by
the
girls
and
her
mother
leaning
with
bowed
head
on
his
shoulder
yes
i
fetched
jim
back
he
said
steadily
but
very
low
it
all
arranged
an
we
bury
him
oh
dad
cried
lenore
hello
my
girl
he
replied
and
kissed
her
i
sorry
to
tell
you
i
could
locate
kurt
dorn
that
new
york
an
that
trainin
camp
he
held
up
his
hands
in
utter
futility
of
expression
lenore
quick
eyes
noted
his
face
had
grown
thin
and
haggard
and
she
made
sure
with
a
pang
that
his
hair
was
whiter
i
sure
glad
to
be
home
he
said
with
a
heavy
expulsion
of
breath
i
want
to
clean
up
an
have
a
bite
to
eat
lenore
was
so
disappointed
at
failing
to
hear
from
dorn
that
she
did
not
think
how
singular
it
was
her
father
did
not
tell
more
about
jim
later
he
seemed
more
like
himself
and
told
them
simply
that
jim
had
contracted
pneumonia
and
died
without
any
message
for
his
folk
at
home
this
prostrated
anderson
again
later
lenore
sought
her
father
in
his
room
he
could
not
conceal
from
her
that
he
had
something
heartrending
on
his
mind
then
there
was
more
than
tragedy
in
his
expression
lenore
felt
a
leap
of
fear
at
what
seemed
her
father
hidden
anger
she
appealed
to
him
importuned
him
plainer
it
came
to
her
that
he
wanted
to
relieve
himself
of
a
burden
then
doubling
her
persuasions
she
finally
got
him
to
talk
lenore
it
not
been
so
long
ago
that
right
here
in
this
room
jim
begged
me
to
let
him
enlist
he
was
of
age
but
would
i
let
him
go
to
fight
for
the
honor
of
our
country
for
the
future
safety
of
our
home
we
all
felt
the
boy
eagerness
his
fire
his
patriotism
wayward
as
he
been
we
suddenly
were
proud
of
him
we
let
him
go
we
gave
him
up
he
was
a
part
of
our
flesh
an
blood
sent
by
us
andersons
to
do
our
share
anderson
paused
in
his
halting
speech
and
swallowed
hard
his
white
face
twitched
strangely
and
his
brow
was
clammy
lenore
saw
that
his
piercing
gaze
looked
far
beyond
her
for
the
instant
that
he
broke
down
jim
was
a
born
fighter
the
father
resumed
he
was
vicious
he
just
had
a
leanin
to
help
anybody
as
a
lad
he
fought
for
his
little
pards
always
on
the
right
side
an
he
always
fought
fair
this
opportunity
to
train
for
a
soldier
made
a
man
of
him
he
have
made
his
mark
in
the
war
strong
an
game
an
fierce
he
he
well
he
dead
he
four
months
after
enlistment
he
dead
an
he
never
had
a
rifle
in
his
hands
he
never
had
his
hands
on
a
or
a
piece
of
artillery
he
never
had
a
uniform
he
never
had
an
overcoat
he
never
then
anderson
voice
shook
so
that
he
had
to
stop
to
gain
control
lenore
was
horrified
she
felt
a
burning
stir
within
her
lem
me
get
this
out
choked
anderson
his
face
now
livid
his
veins
bulging
i
drove
to
tell
it
i
was
near
all
day
locatin
company
found
the
tent
where
he
lived
it
was
cold
damp
muddy
jim
messmates
spoke
high
of
him
called
him
a
prince
they
all
owed
him
money
he
done
many
a
good
turn
for
them
he
had
only
a
thin
blanket
an
he
caught
cold
all
the
boys
had
colds
one
night
he
gave
that
blanket
to
a
boy
sicker
than
he
was
next
day
he
got
worse
there
was
miles
an
miles
of
them
tents
i
like
to
never
found
the
hospital
where
they
sent
jim
an
then
it
was
six
in
the
mornin
a
raw
bleak
day
that
freeze
one
of
us
to
the
marrow
i
had
trouble
gettin
in
but
a
soldier
went
with
me
an
an
anderson
voice
went
to
a
whisper
and
he
looked
pityingly
at
lenore
that
hospital
was
a
barn
no
doctors
too
early
the
nurses
in
sight
i
met
one
later
an
poor
girl
she
looked
ready
to
drop
herself
we
found
jim
in
one
of
the
little
rooms
no
heat
it
was
winter
there
only
a
bed
jim
lay
on
the
floor
dead
he
fallen
or
pitched
off
the
bed
he
had
on
only
his
underclothes
that
he
had
on
when
he
left
home
he
was
stiff
an
must
have
been
dead
a
good
while
lenore
held
out
her
trembling
hands
dead
jim
dead
like
that
she
faltered
yes
he
got
pneumonia
replied
anderson
hoarsely
the
camp
was
full
of
it
but
my
god
were
not
the
the
poor
boys
taken
care
of
implored
lenore
faintly
it
a
terrible
time
all
was
done
that
be
done
then
it
was
all
for
nothing
all
all
our
boy
an
many
like
him
the
best
blood
of
our
country
western
blood
dead
because
because
anderson
voice
failed
him
oh
jim
oh
my
brother
dead
like
a
poor
neglected
dog
jim
who
enlisted
to
fight
for
lenore
broke
down
then
and
hurried
away
to
her
room
with
great
difficulty
anderson
was
revived
and
it
became
manifest
that
the
prop
upon
which
she
had
leaned
had
been
slipped
from
under
her
the
spirit
which
had
made
her
strong
to
endure
the
death
of
her
boy
failed
when
the
sordid
bald
truth
of
a
miserable
and
horrible
waste
of
life
gave
the
lie
to
the
splendid
fighting
chance
jim
had
dreamed
of
when
anderson
realized
that
she
was
fading
daily
he
exhausted
himself
in
long
expositions
of
the
illness
and
injury
and
death
common
to
armies
in
the
making
more
deaths
came
from
these
causes
than
from
war
it
was
the
elision
of
the
weaker
element
the
survival
of
the
fittest
and
some
indeed
very
many
mothers
must
lose
their
sons
that
way
the
government
was
sound
at
the
core
he
claimed
and
his
own
rage
was
at
the
few
incompetents
and
profiteers
these
must
be
weeded
out
a
process
that
was
going
on
the
gigantic
task
of
a
government
to
draft
and
prepare
a
great
army
and
navy
was
something
beyond
the
grasp
of
ordinary
minds
anderson
talked
about
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
proving
the
wonderful
stride
already
made
but
all
that
he
said
now
made
no
impression
upon
anderson
she
had
made
her
supreme
sacrifice
for
a
certain
end
and
that
was
as
much
the
boy
fiery
ambition
to
fight
as
it
was
her
duty
common
with
other
mothers
to
furnish
a
man
at
the
front
what
a
hopeless
awful
sacrifice
she
sank
under
it
those
were
trying
days
for
lenore
just
succeeding
her
father
return
and
she
had
little
time
to
think
of
herself
when
the
mail
came
day
after
day
without
a
letter
from
dorn
she
felt
the
pang
in
her
breast
grow
heavier
intimations
crowded
upon
her
of
impending
troubles
that
would
make
the
present
ones
seem
light
it
was
not
long
until
the
mother
was
laid
to
rest
beside
the
son
when
that
day
ended
lenore
and
her
father
faced
each
other
in
her
room
where
he
had
always
been
wont
to
come
for
sympathy
they
gazed
at
each
other
with
hard
dry
eyes
truth
grim
reality
the
nature
of
this
catastrophe
the
consciousness
of
war
dawned
for
each
in
the
look
of
the
other
brutal
shock
and
then
this
second
exceeding
bitter
woe
awakened
their
minds
to
the
futility
of
individual
life
lenore
it
over
he
said
huskily
as
he
sank
into
a
chair
like
a
nightmare
what
have
i
got
to
live
for
you
have
us
girls
replied
lenore
and
if
you
did
not
have
us
there
would
be
many
others
for
you
to
live
for
dad
ca
you
see
i
reckon
but
i
growin
old
an
mebbe
i
quit
no
dad
you
never
quit
suppose
all
we
americans
quit
that
mean
a
german
victory
never
never
never
by
god
you
right
he
ejaculated
with
the
trembling
strain
of
his
face
suddenly
fixing
blood
and
life
shot
into
his
eyes
he
got
up
heavily
and
began
to
stride
to
and
fro
before
her
you
see
clearer
than
me
you
always
did
lenore
i
beginning
to
see
but
i
ca
tell
you
replied
lenore
closing
her
eyes
indeed
there
seemed
a
colossal
vision
before
her
veiled
and
strange
whatever
happens
we
break
it
because
of
the
war
we
have
our
tasks
greater
now
than
ever
we
believe
could
be
thrust
upon
us
yours
to
show
men
what
you
are
made
of
to
raise
wheat
as
never
before
in
your
life
mine
to
show
my
sisters
and
my
friends
all
the
women
what
their
duty
is
we
must
sacrifice
work
prepare
and
fight
for
the
future
i
reckon
he
nodded
solemnly
loss
of
mother
an
jim
changes
this
damned
war
whatever
in
my
power
to
do
must
go
on
so
some
one
can
take
it
up
when
i
that
the
great
conception
dad
added
lenore
earnestly
we
are
tragically
awakened
we
been
surprised
terribly
struck
in
the
dark
something
monstrous
and
horrible
i
can
feel
the
menace
in
it
for
all
over
every
family
in
this
broad
land
lenore
you
said
once
that
jim
now
how
you
know
it
was
all
over
for
him
a
woman
heart
dad
when
i
said
to
jim
i
knew
it
was
forever
did
you
feel
that
way
about
kurt
dorn
no
he
will
come
back
to
me
i
dream
it
it
in
my
spirit
my
instinct
of
life
my
life
of
the
future
it
in
my
belief
in
god
kurt
dorn
ordeal
will
be
worse
than
death
for
him
but
i
believe
as
i
pray
that
he
will
come
home
alive
then
after
all
you
do
hope
said
her
father
lenore
when
i
was
down
east
i
seen
what
women
were
doin
the
bad
women
are
good
an
the
good
women
are
great
i
think
women
have
more
to
do
with
war
then
men
even
if
they
do
stay
home
it
must
be
because
women
are
mothers
lenore
you
bucked
me
up
i
go
at
things
now
the
need
for
wheat
next
year
will
be
beyond
calculation
i
buy
ten
thousand
acres
of
that
wheatland
round
old
chris
dorn
farm
an
my
shot
at
the
germans
will
be
wheat
i
raise
a
million
bushels
next
morning
in
the
mail
was
a
long
thick
envelope
addressed
to
lenore
in
handwriting
that
shook
her
heart
and
made
her
fly
to
the
seclusion
of
her
room
new
york
city
dearest
when
you
receive
this
i
will
be
in
france
then
lenore
sustained
a
strange
shock
the
beloved
handwriting
faded
the
thick
sheets
of
paper
fell
and
all
about
her
seemed
dark
and
whirling
as
the
sudden
joy
and
excitement
stirred
by
the
letter
changed
to
sickening
pain
he
in
france
she
whispered
oh
kurt
a
storm
of
love
and
terror
burst
over
her
it
had
the
onset
and
the
advantage
of
a
bewildering
surprise
it
laid
low
for
the
moment
her
fortifications
of
sacrifice
strength
and
resolve
she
had
been
forced
into
womanhood
and
her
fear
her
agony
were
all
the
keener
for
the
intelligence
and
spirit
that
had
repudiated
selfish
love
kurt
dorn
was
in
france
in
the
land
of
the
trenches
strife
possessed
her
and
had
a
moment
of
raw
bitter
triumph
she
bit
her
lips
and
clenched
her
fists
to
restrain
the
impulse
to
rush
madly
around
the
room
to
scream
out
her
fear
and
hate
with
forcing
her
thought
with
hard
return
to
old
arguments
there
came
back
the
nobler
emotions
but
when
she
took
up
the
letter
again
with
trembling
hands
her
heart
fluttered
high
and
sick
and
she
saw
the
words
through
blurred
eyes
i
give
the
letter
to
an
ensign
who
has
promised
to
mail
it
the
moment
he
gets
back
to
new
york
lenore
your
letter
telling
me
about
jim
was
held
up
in
the
mail
but
thank
goodness
i
got
it
in
time
i
already
been
transferred
and
expected
orders
any
day
to
go
on
board
the
transport
where
i
am
writing
now
i
have
written
you
or
at
least
telegraphed
you
yesterday
after
seeing
jim
if
i
had
not
expected
to
see
him
again
but
this
morning
we
were
marched
on
board
and
i
can
not
even
get
this
letter
off
to
you
lenore
your
brother
is
a
very
sick
boy
i
lost
some
hours
finding
him
they
did
not
want
to
let
me
see
him
but
i
implored
said
that
i
was
engaged
to
his
sister
and
finally
i
got
in
the
nurse
was
very
sympathetic
but
i
did
care
for
the
doctors
in
charge
they
seemed
hard
hurried
brusque
but
they
have
their
troubles
the
hospital
was
a
long
barracks
and
it
was
full
of
cripples
the
nurse
took
me
into
a
small
bare
room
too
damp
and
cold
for
a
sick
man
and
i
said
so
she
just
looked
at
me
jim
looks
like
you
more
than
any
other
of
the
andersons
i
recognized
that
at
the
same
moment
i
saw
how
very
sick
he
was
they
had
told
me
outside
that
he
had
a
bad
case
of
pneumonia
he
was
awake
perfectly
conscious
and
he
stared
at
me
with
eyes
that
set
my
heart
going
hello
jim
i
said
and
offered
my
hand
as
i
sat
down
on
the
bed
he
was
too
weak
to
shake
hands
who
you
he
asked
he
could
speak
very
well
when
i
told
him
my
name
and
that
i
was
his
sister
fiancé
his
face
changed
so
he
did
not
look
like
the
same
person
it
was
beautiful
oh
it
showed
how
homesick
he
was
then
i
talked
a
blue
streak
about
you
about
the
girls
about
many
waters
how
i
lost
my
wheat
and
everything
he
was
intensely
interested
and
when
i
got
through
he
whispered
that
he
guessed
lenore
had
picked
a
winner
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
was
curious
about
me
and
asked
me
questions
till
the
nurse
made
him
stop
i
was
never
so
glad
about
anything
as
i
was
about
the
happiness
it
evidently
gave
him
to
meet
me
and
hear
from
home
i
promised
to
come
next
day
if
we
did
not
sail
then
he
showed
what
i
must
call
despair
he
must
have
been
passionately
eager
to
get
to
france
the
nurse
dragged
me
out
jim
called
weakly
after
me
kurt
stick
some
germans
for
me
i
never
forget
his
tone
nor
his
look
lenore
he
does
expect
to
get
over
to
france
i
questioned
the
nurse
and
she
shook
her
head
doubtfully
she
looked
sad
she
said
jim
had
been
the
lion
of
his
regiment
i
questioned
a
doctor
and
he
was
annoyed
he
put
me
off
with
a
sharp
statement
that
jim
was
not
in
danger
but
i
think
he
is
i
hope
and
pray
he
recovers
we
sailed
yesterday
it
was
a
wonderful
experience
leaving
hoboken
our
transport
and
the
dock
looked
as
if
they
had
a
huge
swarm
of
yellow
bees
hanging
over
everything
the
bees
were
soldiers
the
most
profound
emotion
i
ever
had
except
the
one
when
you
told
me
you
loved
me
came
over
me
as
the
big
boat
swung
free
of
the
dock
of
the
good
old
of
home
i
wanted
to
jump
off
and
swim
through
the
eddying
green
water
to
the
piles
and
hide
in
them
till
the
boat
had
gone
as
we
backed
out
pulled
up
tugs
and
got
started
down
the
river
my
thrills
increased
until
we
passed
the
statue
of
liberty
and
then
i
could
tell
how
i
felt
one
thing
i
could
not
see
very
well
i
gazed
beyond
the
colossal
statue
that
france
gave
to
the
across
the
water
and
the
ships
and
the
docks
toward
the
west
that
i
was
leaving
feeling
like
mine
then
only
comes
once
to
a
man
in
his
life
first
i
seemed
to
see
all
the
vast
space
the
farms
valleys
woods
deserts
rivers
and
mountains
between
me
and
my
golden
then
i
saw
my
home
and
it
was
as
if
i
had
a
magnificent
photograph
before
my
very
eyes
a
sudden
rush
of
tears
blinded
me
such
a
storm
of
sweetness
regret
memory
then
at
last
you
as
you
stood
before
me
last
the
very
loveliest
girl
in
all
the
world
my
heart
almost
burst
and
in
the
wild
sick
pain
of
the
moment
i
had
a
strange
comforting
flash
of
thought
that
a
man
who
could
leave
you
must
be
impelled
by
something
great
in
store
for
him
i
feel
that
i
told
you
once
to
laugh
at
death
that
is
what
i
shall
do
but
perhaps
that
is
not
the
great
experience
which
will
come
to
me
i
saw
the
sun
set
in
the
sea
back
toward
the
western
horizon
where
the
thin
dark
line
that
was
land
disappeared
in
the
red
glow
the
wind
blows
hard
the
water
is
rough
dark
gray
and
cold
i
like
the
taste
of
the
spray
our
boat
rolls
heavily
and
many
boys
are
already
sick
i
do
not
imagine
the
motion
will
affect
me
it
is
stuffy
i
spend
what
time
i
can
above
where
i
can
see
and
feel
it
was
dark
just
now
when
i
came
below
and
as
i
looked
out
into
the
windy
darkness
and
strife
i
was
struck
by
the
strangeness
of
the
sea
and
how
it
seemed
to
be
like
my
soul
for
a
long
time
i
have
been
looking
into
my
soul
and
i
find
such
ceaseless
strife
such
dark
unlit
depths
such
chaos
these
thoughts
and
emotions
always
with
me
keep
me
from
getting
close
to
my
comrades
no
not
me
but
it
keeps
them
away
from
me
i
think
they
regard
me
strangely
they
all
talk
of
submarines
they
are
afraid
some
will
lose
sleep
at
night
but
i
never
think
of
a
submarine
when
i
gaze
out
over
the
tumbling
black
waters
what
i
think
of
what
i
am
going
after
what
i
need
seems
far
far
away
always
i
am
no
closer
now
than
when
i
was
at
your
home
so
it
has
not
to
do
with
distance
and
lenore
maybe
it
has
not
to
do
with
trenches
or
germans
it
grows
harder
to
get
a
chance
to
write
and
harder
for
me
to
express
myself
when
i
could
write
i
have
to
work
or
am
on
duty
when
i
have
a
little
leisure
i
am
somehow
clamped
this
old
chugging
boat
beats
the
waves
hour
after
hour
all
day
and
all
night
i
can
feel
the
vibration
when
i
asleep
many
things
happen
that
would
interest
you
just
the
duty
and
play
of
the
soldiers
for
that
matter
and
the
stories
i
hear
going
from
lip
to
lip
and
the
accidents
oh
so
much
happens
but
all
these
rush
out
of
my
mind
the
moment
i
sit
down
to
write
there
is
something
at
work
in
me
as
vast
and
heaving
as
the
ocean
at
first
i
had
a
fear
a
dislike
of
the
ocean
but
that
is
gone
it
is
indescribable
to
stand
on
the
open
deck
at
night
as
we
are
driving
on
and
on
and
on
to
look
up
at
the
grand
silent
stars
that
know
that
understand
yet
are
somehow
merciless
to
look
out
across
the
starlit
moving
sea
its
ceaseless
movement
at
first
distressed
me
now
i
feel
that
it
is
perpetually
moving
to
try
to
become
still
to
seek
a
level
to
find
itself
to
quiet
down
to
peace
but
that
will
never
be
and
i
think
if
the
ocean
is
not
like
the
human
heart
then
what
is
it
like
this
voyage
will
be
good
for
me
the
hard
incessant
objective
life
the
physical
life
of
a
soldier
somehow
comes
to
a
halt
on
board
ship
and
every
hour
now
is
immeasurable
for
me
whatever
the
mystery
of
life
of
death
of
what
drives
me
of
why
i
can
not
help
fight
the
demon
in
me
of
this
thing
called
war
the
certainty
is
that
these
dark
strange
nights
on
the
sea
have
given
me
a
hope
and
faith
that
the
truth
is
not
utterly
unattainable
we
in
the
danger
zone
now
with
destroyers
around
us
and
a
cruiser
ahead
i
am
all
eyes
and
ears
i
lose
sleep
at
night
from
thinking
so
hard
the
ship
doctor
stopped
me
the
other
day
studied
my
face
then
he
said
you
too
intense
you
think
too
hard
are
you
afraid
and
i
laughed
in
his
face
absolutely
no
i
told
him
then
forget
and
mix
with
the
boys
play
cut
up
fight
do
anything
but
that
doctor
is
a
good
chap
but
he
figure
kurt
dorn
if
he
imagines
the
germans
can
kill
me
by
making
me
think
we
nearing
france
now
and
the
very
air
is
charged
an
aeroplane
came
out
to
meet
us
welcome
us
i
guess
and
it
flew
low
the
soldiers
went
wild
i
never
had
such
a
thrill
that
air
game
would
just
suit
me
if
i
were
fitted
for
it
but
i
no
mechanic
besides
i
too
big
and
heavy
my
place
will
be
in
the
front
line
with
a
bayonet
strange
how
a
bayonet
fascinates
me
they
say
we
ca
write
home
anything
about
the
war
i
write
you
something
whenever
i
can
do
be
unhappy
if
you
do
not
hear
often
or
if
my
letters
cease
to
come
my
heart
and
my
mind
are
full
of
you
whatever
comes
to
me
the
training
over
here
the
going
to
the
trenches
the
fighting
i
shall
be
safe
if
only
i
can
remember
you
with
love
kurt
lenore
carried
that
letter
in
her
bosom
when
she
went
out
to
walk
in
the
fields
to
go
over
the
old
ground
she
and
kurt
had
trod
hand
in
hand
from
the
stone
seat
above
the
brook
she
watched
the
sunset
all
was
still
except
the
murmur
of
the
running
water
and
somehow
she
could
not
long
bear
that
as
the
light
began
to
shade
on
the
slopes
she
faced
them
feeling
as
always
a
strength
come
to
her
from
their
familiar
lines
twilight
found
her
high
above
the
ranch
and
absolutely
alone
she
would
have
this
lonely
hour
and
then
all
her
mind
and
energy
must
go
to
what
she
knew
was
imperative
duty
she
would
work
to
the
limit
of
her
endurance
it
was
an
autumn
twilight
with
a
cool
wind
gray
sky
and
sad
barren
slopes
the
fertile
valley
seemed
half
obscured
in
melancholy
haze
and
over
toward
the
dim
hills
beyond
night
had
already
fallen
no
stars
no
moon
no
afterglow
of
sunset
illumined
the
grayness
that
in
this
hour
seemed
prophetic
of
lenore
future
he
said
shall
be
safe
if
only
i
can
remember
you
she
whispered
to
herself
wonderingly
what
did
he
mean
pondering
the
thought
she
divined
it
had
to
do
with
dorn
singular
spiritual
mood
he
had
gone
to
lend
his
body
as
so
much
physical
brawn
so
much
weight
to
a
concerted
movement
of
men
but
his
mind
was
apart
from
a
harmony
with
that
lenore
felt
that
whatever
had
been
the
sacrifice
made
by
kurt
dorn
it
had
been
passed
with
his
decision
to
go
to
war
what
she
prayed
for
then
was
something
of
his
spirit
slowly
in
the
gathering
darkness
she
descended
the
long
slope
the
approaching
night
seemed
sad
with
autumn
song
of
insects
all
about
her
breathed
faith
from
the
black
hills
above
the
gray
slopes
below
from
the
shadowy
void
from
the
murmuring
of
insect
life
in
the
grass
the
rugged
fallow
ground
under
her
feet
seemed
to
her
to
be
a
symbol
of
faith
faith
that
winter
would
come
and
pass
the
spring
sun
and
rain
would
burst
the
seeds
of
wheat
and
another
summer
would
see
the
golden
fields
of
waving
grain
if
she
did
not
live
to
see
them
they
would
be
there
just
the
same
and
so
life
and
nature
had
faith
in
its
promise
that
strange
whisper
was
to
lenore
the
whisper
of
god
chapter
xxvi
through
the
pale
obscurity
of
a
french
night
cool
raw
moist
with
a
hint
of
spring
in
its
freshness
a
line
of
soldiers
plodded
along
the
lonely
melancholy
lanes
wan
starlight
showed
in
the
rifts
between
the
clouds
neither
dark
nor
light
the
midnight
hour
had
its
unreality
in
this
line
of
marching
men
and
its
reality
in
the
dim
vague
hedges
its
spectral
posts
its
barren
fields
rain
had
ceased
to
fall
but
a
fine
cold
penetrating
mist
filled
the
air
the
ground
was
muddy
in
places
slippery
in
others
and
here
and
there
it
held
pools
of
water
the
stride
of
the
marching
men
appeared
short
and
dragging
without
swing
or
rhythm
it
was
weary
yet
full
of
the
latent
power
of
youth
of
unused
vitality
stern
youthful
faces
were
set
northward
unchanging
in
the
shadowy
pale
gleams
of
the
night
these
faces
lifted
intensely
whenever
a
strange
muffled
roar
rolled
out
of
the
murky
north
the
night
looked
stormy
but
that
rumble
was
not
thunder
fifty
miles
northward
beyond
that
black
and
mysterious
horizon
great
guns
were
booming
war
sometimes
as
the
breeze
failed
the
night
was
silent
except
for
the
slow
sloppy
tramp
of
the
marching
soldiers
then
the
low
voices
were
hushed
when
the
wind
freshened
again
it
brought
at
intervals
those
deep
significant
detonations
which
as
the
hours
passed
seemed
to
grow
heavier
and
more
thunderous
at
length
a
faint
gray
light
appeared
along
the
eastern
sky
and
gradually
grew
stronger
the
dawn
of
another
day
was
close
at
hand
it
broke
as
if
reluctantly
cold
and
gray
and
sunless
the
detachment
of
united
states
troops
halted
for
camp
outside
of
the
french
village
of
a
kurt
dorn
was
at
mess
with
his
squad
the
months
in
france
had
flown
away
on
wings
of
training
and
absorbing
and
waiting
dorn
had
changed
incalculably
but
all
he
realized
of
it
was
that
he
weighed
one
hundred
and
ninety
pounds
and
that
he
seemed
to
have
lived
a
hundred
swift
lives
all
that
he
saw
and
felt
became
part
of
him
his
comrades
had
been
won
to
him
as
friends
by
virtue
of
his
helping
hand
by
his
devotion
to
training
by
his
acceptance
of
all
the
toils
and
knocks
and
pains
common
to
the
making
of
a
soldier
the
squad
lived
together
as
one
large
family
of
brothers
dorn
comrades
had
at
first
tormented
him
with
his
german
name
they
had
made
fun
of
his
abstraction
and
his
they
had
misunderstood
his
aloofness
but
the
ridicule
died
away
and
now
in
the
presaged
nature
of
events
his
comrades
all
governed
by
the
physical
life
of
the
soldier
took
him
for
a
man
perhaps
it
might
have
been
chance
or
it
might
have
been
true
of
all
the
american
squads
but
the
fact
was
that
dorn
squad
was
a
strangely
assorted
set
of
young
men
perhaps
that
might
have
been
conviction
from
coming
to
live
long
with
them
they
were
a
part
of
the
new
york
division
of
the
th
all
supposed
to
be
new
york
men
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
was
not
true
dorn
was
a
native
of
washington
sanborn
was
a
sturdy
fellow
with
the
clear
brown
tan
and
clear
brown
eyes
of
the
californian
brewer
was
from
south
carolina
a
lean
lanky
southerner
with
dark
eyes
dixon
hailed
from
massachusetts
from
a
fighting
family
and
from
harvard
where
he
had
been
a
noted
athlete
he
was
a
big
lithe
handsome
boy
and
purcell
was
a
of
rich
family
highly
connected
and
his
easy
clean
fine
ways
with
the
elegance
of
his
person
his
blond
distinction
made
him
stand
out
from
his
comrades
though
he
was
clad
identically
with
them
rogers
claimed
the
bronx
to
be
his
home
and
he
was
proud
of
it
he
was
little
almost
undersized
but
a
knot
of
muscle
a
youth
with
irish
blood
in
him
these
particular
soldiers
of
the
squad
were
closest
to
dorn
corporal
bob
owens
came
swinging
in
to
throw
his
sombrero
down
what
the
orders
bob
some
one
inquired
we
going
to
rest
here
he
replied
the
news
was
taken
impatiently
by
several
and
agreeably
by
the
majority
they
were
all
and
worn
dorn
did
not
comment
on
the
news
but
the
fact
was
that
he
hated
the
french
villages
they
were
so
old
so
dirty
so
obsolete
so
different
from
what
he
had
been
accustomed
to
but
he
loved
the
pastoral
french
countryside
so
calm
and
picturesque
he
reflected
that
soon
he
would
see
the
devastation
wrought
by
the
huns
any
news
from
the
front
asked
dixon
i
should
smile
replied
the
corporal
grimly
well
open
up
you
clam
owens
thereupon
told
swiftly
and
forcibly
what
he
had
heard
more
advance
of
the
germans
it
was
familiar
news
but
somehow
it
was
taken
differently
here
within
sound
of
the
guns
dorn
studied
his
comrades
wondering
if
their
sensations
were
similar
to
his
he
expressed
nothing
of
what
he
felt
but
all
the
others
had
something
to
say
hard
cool
fiery
violent
speech
that
differed
as
those
who
uttered
it
differed
yet
its
predominant
note
rang
fight
just
heard
a
funny
story
said
owens
presently
spring
it
somebody
replied
this
comes
from
berlin
so
they
say
according
to
rumor
the
kaiser
and
the
crown
prince
seldom
talk
to
each
other
they
happened
to
meet
the
other
day
and
the
crown
prince
said
pop
what
got
us
into
this
war
the
emperor
replied
son
i
was
deluded
sire
impossible
exclaimed
the
prince
could
it
be
some
years
ago
i
was
visited
by
a
grinning
from
new
york
no
other
than
the
great
i
took
him
around
he
was
most
interested
in
my
troops
after
he
had
inspected
them
and
particularly
the
imperial
guard
he
slapped
me
on
the
back
and
shouted
bill
you
could
lick
the
world
and
my
son
i
fell
for
it
this
story
fetched
a
roar
from
every
soldier
present
except
dorn
an
absence
of
mirth
in
him
had
been
noted
before
dorn
ca
you
laugh
protested
dixon
sure
i
can
when
i
hear
something
funny
replied
dorn
his
comrades
gazed
hopelessly
at
him
my
lawd
boy
thet
was
shore
funny
drawled
brewer
with
his
lazy
southern
manner
kurt
you
not
human
said
owens
sadly
that
why
they
call
you
demon
dorn
all
the
boys
in
the
squad
had
nicknames
in
dorn
case
several
had
been
applied
by
irrepressible
comrades
before
one
stuck
the
first
one
received
a
poor
reception
from
kurt
the
second
happened
to
be
a
great
blunder
for
the
soldier
who
invented
it
he
was
not
in
dorn
squad
but
he
knew
dorn
pretty
well
and
in
a
moment
of
deviltry
he
had
coined
for
dorn
the
name
kaiser
dorn
dorn
reaction
to
this
appellation
was
discomfiting
and
painful
for
the
soldier
as
he
lay
flat
on
the
ground
where
dorn
had
knocked
him
he
had
struggled
with
a
natural
rage
quickly
to
overcome
it
he
showed
the
right
kind
of
spirit
he
got
up
dorn
i
apologize
i
was
only
in
fun
but
some
fun
is
about
as
funny
as
death
on
the
way
out
he
suggested
a
more
felicitous
name
demon
dorn
somehow
the
boys
took
to
that
it
fitted
many
of
dorn
violent
actions
in
training
especially
the
way
he
made
a
bayonet
charge
dorn
objected
strenuously
but
the
name
stuck
no
comrade
or
soldier
ever
again
made
a
hint
of
dorn
german
name
or
blood
fellows
if
a
funny
story
ca
make
dorn
laugh
he
absolutely
a
dead
one
said
owens
spring
a
new
one
quick
spoke
up
some
one
gee
it
great
to
laugh
why
i
not
heard
from
home
for
a
month
dorn
will
you
beat
it
so
i
can
spring
this
one
queried
owens
sure
replied
dorn
amiably
as
he
started
away
i
suppose
you
think
me
one
of
these
sort
of
chaps
forget
her
dorn
come
out
of
it
chirped
up
rogers
to
dorn
regret
he
believed
that
he
failed
his
comrades
in
one
way
and
he
was
always
trying
to
make
up
for
it
part
of
the
training
of
a
soldier
was
the
need
and
duty
of
cheerfulness
every
member
of
the
squad
had
his
secret
his
own
personal
memory
his
inner
consciousness
that
he
strove
to
keep
hidden
long
ago
dorn
had
divined
that
this
or
that
comrade
was
looking
toward
the
bright
side
or
pretending
there
was
one
they
all
played
their
parts
like
men
they
faced
this
incomprehensible
duty
this
tremendous
separation
this
dark
and
looming
future
as
if
it
was
only
hard
work
that
must
be
done
in
good
spirit
but
dorn
despite
all
his
will
was
mostly
silent
aloof
brooding
locked
up
in
his
eternal
strife
of
mind
and
soul
he
could
not
help
it
notwithstanding
all
he
saw
and
divined
of
the
sacrifice
and
pain
of
his
comrades
he
knew
that
his
ordeal
was
infinitely
harder
it
was
natural
that
they
hoped
for
the
best
he
had
no
hope
boys
said
owens
there
a
squad
of
blue
devils
camped
over
here
in
an
old
barn
just
back
from
the
front
some
one
said
there
was
a
man
in
it
who
had
had
a
dozen
wounds
and
some
twice
that
many
we
must
see
that
bunch
bravest
soldiers
of
the
whole
war
they
been
through
the
three
years
at
verdun
on
the
marne
and
now
this
awful
flanders
drive
it
up
to
us
to
see
them
news
like
this
thrilled
dorn
during
all
the
months
he
had
been
in
france
the
deeds
and
valor
of
these
blue
devils
had
come
to
him
here
and
there
and
everywhere
dorn
remembered
all
he
heard
and
believed
it
too
though
some
of
the
charges
and
some
of
the
burdens
attributed
to
these
famed
soldiers
seemed
unbelievable
his
opportunity
had
now
come
with
the
moving
up
to
the
front
he
would
meet
reality
and
all
within
him
the
keen
strange
eagerness
the
curiosity
that
perplexed
the
unintelligible
longing
the
heat
and
burn
of
passion
quickened
and
intensified
not
until
late
in
the
afternoon
however
did
off
duty
present
an
opportunity
for
him
to
go
into
the
village
it
looked
the
same
as
the
other
villages
he
had
visited
and
the
inhabitants
old
men
old
women
and
children
all
had
the
somber
eyes
the
strained
hungry
faces
the
oppressed
look
he
had
become
accustomed
to
see
but
sad
as
were
these
inhabitants
of
a
village
near
the
front
there
was
never
in
any
one
of
them
any
absence
of
welcome
to
the
americans
indeed
in
most
people
he
met
there
was
a
quick
flashing
of
intense
joy
and
gratitude
the
americans
had
come
across
the
sea
to
fight
beside
the
french
that
was
the
import
tremendous
and
beautiful
dorn
met
dixon
and
rogers
on
the
main
street
of
the
little
village
they
had
been
to
see
the
blue
devils
better
stay
away
from
them
advised
dixon
dubiously
no
why
ejaculated
dorn
dixon
shook
his
head
greatest
bunch
i
ever
looked
at
but
i
think
they
resented
our
presence
pat
and
i
were
talking
about
them
it
strange
dorn
but
i
believe
these
blue
devils
that
have
saved
france
and
england
and
perhaps
america
too
do
like
our
being
here
impossible
replied
dorn
go
and
see
for
yourself
put
in
rogers
i
believe
we
all
ought
to
look
them
over
thoughtfully
dorn
strode
on
in
the
direction
indicated
and
presently
he
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
village
where
in
an
old
orchard
he
found
a
low
rambling
dilapidated
barn
before
which
clusters
of
soldiers
in
blue
lounged
around
smoking
fires
as
he
drew
closer
he
saw
that
most
of
them
seemed
fixed
in
gloomy
abstraction
a
few
were
employed
at
some
task
of
hand
and
several
bent
over
the
pots
on
fires
dorn
sweeping
gaze
took
in
the
whole
scene
and
his
first
quick
strange
impression
was
that
these
soldiers
resembled
ghouls
who
had
lived
in
dark
holes
of
mud
kurt
meant
to
make
the
most
of
his
opportunity
to
him
in
his
peculiar
need
this
meeting
would
be
of
greater
significance
than
all
else
that
had
happened
to
him
in
france
the
nearest
soldier
sat
on
a
flattened
pile
of
straw
around
which
the
ground
was
muddy
at
first
glance
kurt
took
him
to
be
an
african
so
dark
were
face
and
eyes
no
one
heeded
kurt
approach
the
moment
was
poignant
to
kurt
he
spoke
french
fairly
well
so
that
it
was
emotion
rather
than
lack
of
fluency
which
made
his
utterance
somewhat
unintelligible
the
soldier
raised
his
head
his
face
seemed
a
black
flash
his
eyes
piercingly
black
staring
deep
full
of
terrible
shadow
they
did
not
appear
to
see
in
kurt
the
man
but
only
the
trim
clean
united
states
army
uniform
kurt
repeated
his
address
this
time
more
clearly
the
frenchman
replied
gruffly
and
bent
again
over
the
faded
worn
coat
he
was
scraping
with
a
knife
then
kurt
noticed
two
things
the
great
hollow
spare
frame
and
the
torn
shirt
stained
many
colors
one
of
which
was
dark
red
his
hands
resembled
both
those
of
a
mason
with
the
horny
callous
inside
and
those
of
a
fisherman
with
bludgy
fingers
and
barked
knuckles
that
never
healed
dorn
had
to
choose
his
words
slowly
because
of
unfamiliarity
with
french
but
he
was
deliberate
too
because
he
wanted
to
say
the
right
thing
his
eagerness
made
the
frenchman
glance
up
again
but
while
dorn
talked
of
the
long
waits
the
long
marches
the
arrival
at
this
place
the
satisfaction
at
nearing
the
front
his
listener
gave
no
sign
that
he
heard
but
he
did
hear
and
so
did
several
of
his
comrades
we
coming
strong
he
went
on
his
voice
thrilling
a
million
of
us
this
year
we
untrained
we
have
to
split
up
among
english
and
french
troops
and
learn
how
from
you
but
we
come
and
we
fight
then
the
frenchman
put
on
his
coat
that
showed
him
to
be
an
officer
he
wore
medals
the
dark
glance
he
then
flashed
over
dorn
was
different
from
his
first
it
gave
dorn
both
a
twinge
of
shame
and
a
thrill
of
pride
it
took
in
dorn
characteristic
teutonic
blond
features
and
likewise
an
officer
swift
appreciation
of
an
extraordinarily
splendid
physique
you
german
blood
he
said
yes
but
i
american
replied
dorn
simply
and
he
met
that
black
gaze
with
all
his
intense
and
fearless
spirit
dorn
felt
that
never
in
his
life
had
he
been
subjected
to
such
a
test
of
his
manhood
of
his
truth
my
name
huon
said
the
officer
and
he
extended
one
of
the
huge
deformed
hands
mine
dorn
replied
kurt
meeting
that
hand
with
his
own
whereupon
the
frenchman
spoke
rapidly
to
the
comrade
nearest
him
so
rapidly
that
all
kurt
could
make
of
what
he
said
was
that
here
was
an
american
soldier
with
a
new
idea
they
drew
closer
and
it
became
manifest
that
the
interesting
idea
was
kurt
news
about
the
american
army
it
was
news
here
and
carefully
pondered
by
these
frenchmen
as
slowly
one
by
one
they
questioned
him
they
doubted
but
dorn
convinced
them
they
seemed
to
like
his
talk
and
his
looks
dorn
quick
faculties
grasped
the
simplicity
of
these
soldiers
after
three
terrible
years
of
unprecedented
warfare
during
which
they
had
performed
the
impossible
they
did
not
want
a
fresh
army
to
come
along
and
steal
their
glory
by
administering
a
final
blow
to
a
tottering
enemy
gazing
into
those
strange
seared
faces
beginning
to
see
behind
the
iron
mask
dorn
learned
the
one
thing
a
soldier
lives
fights
and
dies
for
glory
kurt
dorn
was
soon
made
welcome
he
was
made
to
exhaust
his
knowledge
of
french
he
was
studied
by
eyes
that
had
gleamed
in
the
face
of
death
his
hand
was
wrung
by
hands
that
had
dealt
death
how
terribly
he
felt
that
and
presently
when
his
excitement
and
emotion
had
subsided
to
the
extent
that
he
could
really
see
what
he
looked
at
then
came
the
reward
of
reality
with
all
its
incalculable
meaning
expressed
to
him
in
the
gleaming
bayonets
in
the
worn
accoutrements
in
the
greatcoats
like
clapboards
of
mud
in
the
hands
that
were
claws
in
the
feet
that
hobbled
in
the
strange
wonderful
significance
of
bodily
presence
standing
there
as
proof
of
valor
of
man
limitless
endurance
in
the
faces
ah
there
dorn
read
the
history
that
made
him
shudder
and
lifted
him
beyond
himself
for
there
in
those
still
dark
faces
of
boys
grown
old
in
three
years
shone
the
terror
of
war
and
the
spirit
that
had
resisted
it
dorn
in
his
intensity
in
the
of
his
passion
so
terribly
driven
to
prove
to
himself
something
vague
yet
illusive
yet
imperious
divined
what
these
blue
devil
soldiers
had
been
through
his
mind
was
more
than
telepathic
almost
it
seemed
that
souls
were
bared
to
him
these
soldiers
quiet
intent
made
up
a
grim
group
of
men
they
seemed
slow
thoughtful
plodding
wrapped
and
steeped
in
calm
but
dorn
penetrated
all
this
and
established
the
relation
between
it
and
the
nameless
and
dreadful
significance
of
their
weapons
and
medals
and
uniforms
and
stripes
and
the
magnificent
vitality
that
was
now
all
but
spent
dorn
might
have
resembled
a
curious
boy
to
judge
from
his
handling
of
rifles
and
the
way
he
slipped
a
strong
hand
along
the
gleaming
but
he
was
more
than
the
curious
youth
he
had
begun
to
grasp
a
strange
intangible
something
for
which
he
had
no
name
something
that
must
be
attainable
for
him
something
that
for
an
hour
or
a
moment
would
make
him
a
fighter
not
to
be
slighted
by
these
supermen
whatever
his
youth
or
his
impelling
spirit
of
manhood
the
fact
was
that
he
inspired
many
of
these
veterans
of
the
bloody
years
to
homeric
narratives
of
the
siege
of
verdun
of
the
retreat
toward
paris
of
the
victory
of
the
marne
and
lastly
of
the
kaiser
battle
this
last
and
most
awful
offensive
of
the
resourceful
and
frightful
foe
brunelle
told
how
he
was
the
last
survivor
of
a
squad
at
verdun
who
had
been
ordered
to
hold
a
breach
made
in
a
front
stone
wall
along
the
out
posts
how
they
had
faced
a
bombardment
of
heavy
guns
a
whistling
shrieking
thundering
roar
pierced
by
the
higher
explosion
of
a
bursting
shell
smoke
and
sulphur
and
gas
the
crumbling
of
walls
and
downward
fling
of
shrapnel
how
the
lives
of
soldiers
were
as
lives
of
gnats
hurled
by
wind
and
burned
by
flame
death
had
a
manifold
and
horrible
diversity
a
soldier
head
with
ghastly
face
and
conscious
eyes
momentarily
poised
in
the
air
while
the
body
rode
away
invisibly
with
an
exploding
shell
he
told
of
men
blown
up
shot
through
and
riddled
and
brained
and
disemboweled
while
their
comrades
grim
and
unalterable
standing
in
a
stream
of
blood
lived
through
the
rain
of
shells
the
smashing
of
walls
lived
to
fight
like
madmen
the
detachment
following
the
bombardment
and
to
kill
them
every
one
mathie
told
of
the
great
retreat
how
men
who
had
fought
for
days
who
were
unbeaten
and
unafraid
had
obeyed
an
order
they
hated
and
could
not
understand
and
had
marched
day
and
night
day
and
night
eating
as
they
toiled
on
sleeping
while
they
marched
on
and
on
desperate
and
terrible
filled
with
burning
thirst
and
the
agony
of
ceaseless
motion
on
with
dragging
legs
and
laboring
breasts
and
eyes
on
and
onward
unquenchable
with
the
spirit
of
france
sergeant
delorme
spoke
of
the
sudden
fierce
at
the
marne
of
the
irresistible
onslaught
of
men
whose
homes
had
been
invaded
whose
children
had
been
murdered
whose
women
had
been
enslaved
of
a
ruthless
fighting
swift
and
deadly
and
lastly
of
a
bayonet
charge
by
his
own
division
running
down
upon
superior
numbers
engaging
them
in
conflict
malignant
and
fatal
routing
them
over
a
field
of
blood
and
death
monsieur
dorn
do
you
know
the
french
use
of
a
bayonet
asked
delorme
no
replied
dorn
i
will
show
you
he
said
taking
up
two
rifles
and
handing
one
to
dorn
come
it
is
so
and
so
a
trick
the
boches
ca
face
cold
steel
ah
monsieur
you
have
the
supple
wrists
of
a
juggler
you
have
the
arms
of
a
giant
you
have
the
eyes
of
a
duelist
you
will
be
one
grand
spitter
of
german
pigs
dorn
felt
the
blanching
of
his
face
the
tingling
of
his
nerves
the
tightening
of
his
muscles
a
cold
and
terrible
meaning
laid
hold
of
him
even
in
the
instant
when
he
trembled
before
this
french
veteran
who
complimented
him
while
he
instructed
how
easily
dorn
thought
could
this
soldier
slip
the
bright
bayonet
over
his
guard
and
pierce
him
from
breast
to
back
how
horrible
the
proximity
of
that
sinister
blade
with
its
glint
its
turn
its
edge
so
potently
expressive
of
its
history
even
as
dorn
crossed
bayonets
with
this
inspired
frenchman
he
heard
a
soldier
comrade
say
that
delorme
had
let
daylight
through
fourteen
boches
in
that
memorable
victory
of
the
marne
you
are
very
big
and
strong
and
quick
monsieur
said
the
officer
huon
simply
in
you
will
be
a
killer
of
boches
in
their
talk
and
practice
and
help
in
their
intent
to
encourage
the
young
american
soldier
these
blue
devils
one
and
all
dealt
in
frank
and
inevitable
terms
of
death
that
was
their
meaning
in
life
it
was
immeasurably
horrible
for
dorn
because
it
seemed
a
realization
of
his
imagined
visions
he
felt
like
a
child
among
old
savages
of
a
war
tribe
yet
he
was
fascinated
by
this
suggestion
of
man
to
man
in
battle
of
german
to
american
of
materialist
to
idealist
and
beyond
all
control
was
the
bursting
surge
of
his
blood
the
exercises
he
had
gone
through
the
trick
he
had
acquired
somehow
had
strange
power
to
liberate
his
emotion
the
officer
huon
spoke
english
and
upon
his
words
dorn
hung
spellbound
you
americans
have
the
fine
dash
the
nerve
you
will
perform
wonders
but
you
do
realize
what
this
war
is
you
will
perish
of
sheer
curiosity
to
see
or
eagerness
to
fight
but
these
are
the
least
of
the
horrors
of
this
war
actual
fighting
is
to
me
a
relief
a
forgetfulness
an
excitement
and
is
so
with
many
of
my
comrades
we
have
survived
wounds
starvation
poison
gas
and
fire
the
diseases
of
war
the
awful
toil
of
the
trenches
and
each
and
every
one
of
us
who
has
served
long
bears
in
his
mind
the
particular
horror
that
haunts
him
i
have
known
veterans
to
go
mad
at
the
screaming
of
shells
i
have
seen
good
soldiers
stand
upon
a
trench
inviting
the
fire
that
would
end
suspense
for
a
man
who
hopes
to
escape
alive
this
war
is
indeed
the
ninth
circle
of
hell
my
own
particular
horrors
are
mud
water
and
cold
i
have
lived
in
dark
cold
so
long
that
my
mind
concerning
them
is
not
right
i
know
it
the
moment
i
come
out
to
rest
rest
do
you
know
that
we
can
not
rest
the
comfort
of
this
dirty
old
barn
of
these
fires
of
this
bare
ground
is
so
great
that
we
can
not
rest
we
can
not
sleep
we
can
not
do
anything
when
i
think
of
the
past
winter
i
do
not
remember
injury
and
agony
for
myself
or
the
maimed
and
mangled
bodies
of
my
comrades
i
remember
only
the
horrible
cold
the
endless
ages
of
waiting
the
hopeless
misery
of
the
dugouts
foul
black
that
we
had
to
crawl
into
through
sticky
mud
and
filthy
water
mud
water
and
cold
with
the
stench
of
the
dead
clogging
your
nostrils
that
to
me
is
war
misérables
you
americans
will
never
know
that
thank
god
for
it
could
not
be
endured
by
men
who
did
not
belong
to
this
soil
after
all
the
filthy
water
is
half
blood
and
the
mud
is
part
of
the
dead
of
our
people
huon
talked
on
and
on
with
the
eloquence
of
a
frenchman
who
relieves
himself
of
a
burden
he
told
of
trenches
dug
in
a
swamp
lived
in
and
fought
in
and
then
used
for
the
graves
of
the
dead
trenches
that
had
to
be
lived
in
again
months
afterward
the
rotting
dead
were
everywhere
when
they
were
covered
the
rain
would
come
to
wash
away
the
earth
exposing
them
again
that
was
the
strange
refrain
of
this
moody
lament
the
rain
that
fell
the
mud
that
forever
held
him
rooted
fast
in
the
tracks
of
his
despair
he
told
of
night
and
storm
of
a
weary
squad
of
men
lying
flat
trying
to
dig
in
under
cover
of
rain
and
darkness
of
the
hell
of
cannonade
over
and
around
them
he
told
of
hours
that
blasted
men
souls
of
death
that
was
a
blessing
of
escape
that
was
torture
beyond
the
endurance
of
humans
crowning
that
night
of
horrors
piled
on
horrors
when
he
had
seen
a
dozen
men
buried
alive
in
mud
lifted
by
a
monster
shell
when
he
had
seen
a
refuge
deep
underground
opened
and
devastated
by
a
like
projectile
came
a
that
flooded
the
trenches
and
the
fields
drowning
soldiers
whose
injuries
and
garments
impeded
their
movements
and
rendering
escape
for
the
others
an
infernal
labor
and
a
hideous
wretchedness
unutterable
and
insupportable
round
the
the
blue
devils
stood
or
lay
trying
to
rest
but
the
habit
of
the
trenches
was
upon
them
dorn
gazed
at
each
and
every
soldier
so
like
in
strange
resemblance
so
different
in
physical
characteristics
and
the
sad
profound
and
terrifying
knowledge
came
to
him
of
what
they
must
have
in
their
minds
he
realized
that
all
he
needed
was
to
suffer
and
fight
and
live
through
some
little
part
of
the
war
they
had
endured
and
then
some
truth
would
burst
upon
him
it
was
there
in
the
restless
steps
in
the
prone
forms
in
the
sunken
glaring
eyes
what
soldiers
what
men
what
giants
three
and
a
half
years
of
unnamable
and
indescribable
fury
of
action
and
strife
of
thought
not
dead
nor
stolid
like
oxen
were
these
soldiers
of
france
they
had
a
simplicity
that
seemed
appalling
we
have
given
all
we
have
stood
in
the
way
borne
the
brunt
saved
you
this
was
flung
at
dorn
not
out
of
their
thought
but
from
their
presence
the
fact
that
they
were
there
was
enough
he
needed
only
to
find
these
bravest
of
brave
warriors
real
alive
throbbing
men
dorn
lingered
there
loath
to
leave
the
great
lesson
of
his
life
held
vague
connection
in
some
way
with
this
squad
of
french
privates
but
he
could
not
pierce
the
veil
this
meeting
came
as
a
climax
to
four
months
of
momentous
meetings
with
the
best
and
the
riffraff
of
many
nations
dorn
had
studied
talked
listened
and
learned
he
who
had
as
yet
given
nothing
fought
no
enemy
saved
no
comrade
or
refugee
or
child
in
all
this
whirlpool
of
battling
millions
felt
a
profound
sense
of
his
littleness
his
ignorance
he
who
had
imagined
himself
unfortunate
had
been
blind
sick
here
were
soldiers
to
whom
comfort
and
rest
were
the
sweetest
blessings
upon
the
earth
and
they
could
not
grasp
them
no
more
could
they
grasp
them
than
could
the
gaping
civilians
and
the
distinguished
travelers
grasp
what
these
grand
hulks
of
veteran
soldiers
had
done
once
a
group
of
civilians
halted
near
the
soldiers
an
officer
was
their
escort
he
tried
to
hurry
them
on
but
failed
delorme
edged
away
into
the
gloomy
damp
barn
rather
than
meet
such
visitors
some
of
his
comrades
followed
suit
ferier
the
incomparable
of
the
blue
devils
the
wearer
of
all
the
french
medals
and
the
bearer
of
wounds
received
in
battle
he
sneaked
away
afraid
and
humble
and
sullen
to
hide
himself
from
the
curious
that
action
of
ferier
was
a
revelation
to
dorn
he
felt
a
sting
of
shame
there
were
two
classes
of
people
in
relation
to
this
war
those
who
went
to
fight
and
those
who
stayed
behind
what
had
delorme
or
mathie
or
ferier
to
do
with
the
world
of
selfish
comfortable
men
dorn
heard
a
million
voices
of
france
crying
out
the
bitter
truth
that
if
these
veterans
ever
returned
alive
to
their
homes
it
would
be
with
hopes
and
hearts
and
faiths
burned
out
with
hands
forever
lost
to
their
old
use
with
bodies
that
the
war
had
robbed
dorn
bade
his
friends
adieu
and
in
the
darkening
twilight
he
hurried
toward
his
own
camp
if
i
could
go
back
home
now
honorably
and
well
i
would
never
do
it
he
muttered
i
could
bear
to
live
knowing
what
i
know
now
unless
i
had
laughed
at
this
death
and
risked
it
and
dealt
it
he
was
full
of
gladness
of
exultation
in
contemplation
of
the
wonderful
gift
the
hours
had
brought
him
more
than
any
men
of
history
or
present
he
honored
these
soldiers
the
germans
feared
like
an
indian
dorn
respected
brawn
courage
fortitude
silence
aloofness
there
was
a
divinity
in
those
soldiers
he
soliloquized
i
felt
it
in
their
complete
ignorance
of
their
greatness
yet
they
had
pride
jealousy
oh
the
mystery
of
it
all
when
my
day
comes
i
last
one
short
and
terrible
hour
i
would
never
make
a
soldier
like
one
of
them
no
american
could
they
are
frenchmen
whose
homes
have
been
despoiled
in
the
tent
of
his
comrades
that
night
dorn
reverted
from
old
habit
and
with
a
passionate
eloquence
he
told
all
he
had
seen
and
heard
and
much
that
he
had
felt
his
influence
on
these
young
men
long
established
but
subtle
and
unconscious
became
in
that
hour
a
tangible
fact
he
stirred
them
he
felt
them
thoughtful
and
sad
and
yet
more
unflinching
stronger
and
keener
for
the
inevitable
day
chapter
xxvii
the
monstrous
possibility
that
had
consumed
kurt
dorn
for
many
months
at
last
became
an
event
he
had
arrived
on
the
in
france
all
afternoon
the
company
of
united
states
troops
had
marched
from
far
back
of
the
line
resting
as
darkness
came
on
at
a
camp
of
reserves
and
then
going
on
artillery
fire
had
been
desultory
during
this
march
the
big
guns
that
had
rolled
their
thunder
miles
and
miles
were
now
silent
but
an
immense
activity
and
a
horde
of
soldiers
back
of
the
lines
brought
strange
leaden
oppression
to
kurt
dorn
heart
the
last
slow
travel
of
his
squad
over
dark
barren
space
and
through
deep
narrow
winding
lanes
in
the
ground
had
been
a
nightmare
ending
to
the
long
journey
france
had
not
yet
become
clear
to
him
he
was
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
in
spite
of
his
tremendous
interest
and
excitement
all
seemed
abstract
matters
of
his
feeling
the
plague
of
himself
made
actuality
the
substance
of
dreams
that
last
day
the
cumulation
of
months
of
training
and
travel
had
been
one
in
which
he
had
observed
heard
talked
and
felt
in
a
nervous
and
fevered
excitement
but
now
he
imagined
he
could
not
remember
any
of
it
his
poignant
experience
with
the
blue
devils
had
been
a
reality
he
could
never
forget
but
now
this
blackness
of
subterranean
cavern
this
damp
sickening
odor
of
earth
this
presence
of
men
the
strange
muffled
sounds
all
these
were
unreal
how
had
he
come
here
his
mind
labored
with
a
burden
strangely
like
that
on
his
chest
a
different
utterly
unfamiliar
emotion
seemed
rising
over
him
maybe
that
was
because
he
was
very
tired
and
very
sleepy
sometime
that
night
he
must
go
on
duty
he
ought
to
sleep
it
was
impossible
he
could
not
close
his
eyes
an
effort
to
attend
to
what
he
was
actually
doing
disclosed
the
fact
that
he
was
listening
with
all
his
strength
for
what
he
could
not
answer
then
he
heard
the
distant
muffled
sounds
and
low
voices
nearer
and
thuds
and
footfalls
his
comrades
were
near
him
he
heard
their
breathing
he
felt
their
presence
they
were
strained
and
intense
like
him
they
were
locked
up
in
their
own
prison
of
emotions
always
heretofore
on
nights
that
he
lay
sleepless
dorn
had
thought
of
the
two
things
dearest
on
earth
to
him
lenore
anderson
and
the
golden
of
his
home
this
night
he
called
up
lenore
image
it
hung
there
in
the
blackness
a
dim
pale
phantom
of
her
sweet
face
her
beautiful
eyes
her
sad
lips
and
then
it
vanished
not
at
all
could
he
call
up
a
vision
of
his
beloved
so
the
suspicion
that
something
was
wrong
with
his
mind
became
a
certainty
it
angered
him
quickened
his
sensitiveness
even
while
he
despaired
he
ground
his
teeth
and
clenched
his
fists
and
swore
to
realize
his
presence
there
and
to
rise
to
the
occasion
as
had
been
his
vaunted
ambition
suddenly
he
felt
something
slimy
and
hairy
against
his
wrist
then
a
stinging
bite
a
rat
a
trench
rat
that
lived
on
flesh
he
flung
his
arm
violently
and
beat
upon
the
soft
earth
the
incident
of
surprise
and
disgust
helped
dorn
at
least
in
one
way
his
mind
had
been
set
upon
a
strange
and
supreme
condition
of
his
being
there
of
an
emotion
about
to
overcome
him
the
bite
of
a
rat
drawing
blood
made
a
literal
fact
of
his
being
a
soldier
in
a
dugout
at
the
front
waiting
in
the
blackness
for
his
call
to
go
on
guard
this
incident
proved
to
dorn
his
limitations
and
that
he
was
too
terribly
concerned
with
his
feelings
ever
to
last
long
as
a
soldier
but
he
could
not
help
himself
his
pulse
his
heart
his
brain
all
seemed
to
beat
beat
beat
with
a
nameless
passion
was
he
losing
his
nerve
was
he
afraid
his
denial
did
not
reassure
him
he
understood
that
patriotism
and
passion
were
emotions
and
that
the
realities
of
a
soldier
life
were
not
dorn
forced
himself
to
think
of
realities
hoping
thus
to
get
a
grasp
upon
his
vanishing
courage
and
memory
helped
him
not
so
many
days
weeks
months
back
he
had
been
a
different
man
at
bordeaux
when
his
squad
first
set
foot
upon
french
soil
that
was
a
splendid
reality
how
he
had
thrilled
at
the
welcome
of
the
french
sailors
then
he
thought
of
the
strenuous
round
of
army
duties
of
training
tasks
of
traveling
in
cold
of
endless
marches
of
camps
and
villages
of
drills
and
billets
never
to
be
forgotten
was
that
morning
now
seemingly
long
ago
when
an
officer
had
ordered
the
battalion
to
pack
we
are
going
to
the
front
he
announced
magic
words
what
excitement
what
whooping
what
bragging
and
joy
among
the
boys
what
hurry
and
bustle
and
remarkable
efficiency
that
had
been
a
reality
of
actual
experience
but
the
meaning
of
it
the
terrible
significance
had
been
beyond
the
mind
of
any
american
i
here
at
the
front
now
whispered
dorn
to
himself
a
few
rods
away
are
germans
inconceivable
no
reality
at
all
he
went
on
with
his
swift
account
of
things
with
his
mind
ever
sharpening
with
that
strange
mounting
emotion
flooding
to
the
full
ready
to
burst
its
barriers
when
he
and
his
comrades
had
watched
their
transport
trains
move
away
when
they
had
stood
waiting
for
their
own
trains
had
the
idea
of
actual
conflict
yet
dawned
upon
them
dorn
had
to
answer
no
he
remembered
that
he
had
made
few
friends
among
the
inhabitants
of
towns
and
villages
where
he
had
stayed
what
leisure
time
he
got
had
been
given
to
a
seeking
out
of
sailors
soldiers
and
men
of
all
races
with
whom
he
found
himself
in
remarkable
contact
the
ends
of
the
world
brought
together
by
one
war
how
could
his
memory
ever
hold
all
that
had
come
to
him
but
it
did
passion
liberated
it
he
saw
now
that
his
eye
was
a
lens
his
mind
a
sponge
his
heart
a
gulf
out
of
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
american
troops
in
france
what
honor
it
was
to
be
in
the
chosen
battalion
to
go
to
the
front
dorn
lived
only
with
his
squad
but
he
felt
the
envy
of
the
whole
army
what
luck
to
be
chosen
from
so
many
to
go
out
and
see
the
game
through
quickly
he
began
to
consider
that
differently
now
the
luck
might
be
with
the
soldiers
left
behind
always
underneath
dorn
perplexity
and
pondering
under
his
intelligence
and
spirit
at
their
best
had
been
a
something
deeply
personal
something
of
the
internal
of
him
a
selfish
instinct
it
was
the
nature
of
man
like
a
tempest
swept
over
dorn
the
most
significant
ordeal
and
lesson
of
his
experience
in
france
that
wonderful
reality
when
he
met
the
blue
devils
and
they
took
him
in
however
long
he
lived
his
life
must
necessarily
be
transformed
from
contact
with
those
great
men
the
night
march
over
the
unending
roads
through
the
gloom
and
the
spectral
starlight
with
the
dull
rumblings
of
cannon
shocking
his
heart
that
dorn
lived
over
finding
strangely
a
minutest
detail
of
observation
and
a
singular
veracity
of
feeling
fixed
in
his
memory
afternoon
of
that
very
day
at
the
reserve
camp
somewhere
back
there
had
brought
an
officer
address
to
the
soldiers
a
strong
and
emphatic
appeal
as
well
as
order
to
obey
to
do
one
duty
to
take
no
chances
to
be
eternally
vigilant
to
believe
that
every
man
had
advantage
on
his
side
even
in
war
if
he
were
not
a
fool
or
a
daredevil
dorn
had
absorbed
the
speech
remembered
every
word
but
it
all
seemed
futile
now
then
had
come
the
impressive
inspection
of
equipment
a
careful
examination
of
rifles
knapsacks
after
that
the
order
to
march
dorn
imagined
that
he
had
remembered
little
but
he
had
remembered
all
perhaps
the
sense
of
strange
unreality
was
only
the
twist
in
his
mind
yet
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
what
part
of
france
how
far
north
or
south
on
the
front
line
in
what
sector
could
not
that
account
for
the
sense
of
feeling
lost
nevertheless
he
was
there
at
the
end
of
all
this
incomprehensible
journey
he
became
possessed
by
an
irresistible
desire
to
hurry
once
more
dorn
attempted
to
control
the
of
his
thoughts
to
come
down
to
earth
the
earth
was
there
under
his
hand
soft
sticky
moldy
smelling
vilely
he
dug
his
fingers
into
it
until
the
feel
of
something
like
a
bone
made
him
jerk
them
out
perhaps
he
had
felt
a
stone
a
tiny
creeping
chilly
shudder
went
up
his
back
then
he
remembered
he
felt
he
saw
his
little
attic
room
in
the
old
home
back
among
the
of
the
northwest
six
thousand
miles
away
he
would
never
see
that
room
again
what
unaccountable
vagary
of
memory
had
ever
recalled
it
to
him
it
faded
out
of
his
mind
some
of
his
comrades
whispered
now
and
then
one
rolled
over
none
snored
for
none
of
them
slept
dorn
felt
more
aloof
from
them
than
ever
how
isolated
each
one
was
locked
in
his
own
trouble
every
one
of
them
like
himself
had
a
lonely
soul
perhaps
they
were
facing
it
he
could
not
conceive
of
a
careless
thoughtless
emotionless
attitude
toward
this
first
night
in
the
trench
dorn
gradually
grew
more
acutely
sensitive
to
the
many
faint
rustling
whispering
sounds
in
and
near
the
dugout
a
soldier
came
stooping
into
the
opaque
square
of
the
dugout
door
his
rifle
striking
the
framework
gave
out
a
metallic
clink
this
fellow
expelled
a
sudden
heavy
breath
as
if
throwing
off
an
oppression
is
that
you
sanborn
this
whisper
dorn
recognized
as
dixon
it
was
full
of
suppressed
excitement
yes
guess
it
my
turn
next
how
how
does
it
go
sanborn
laugh
had
an
odd
little
quaver
why
so
far
as
i
know
i
guess
it
all
right
damn
queer
though
i
wish
we
got
here
in
daytime
but
maybe
that
would
help
humph
pretty
quiet
out
there
so
bob
says
but
what
he
know
more
than
us
i
heard
guns
up
the
line
and
not
so
far
off
can
you
see
any
not
a
damn
thing
yet
everything
interrupted
sanborn
enigmatically
dixon
called
owens
low
and
quickly
from
the
darkness
dixon
did
not
reply
his
sudden
hard
breathing
the
brushing
of
his
garments
against
the
door
then
swift
soft
steps
dying
away
attested
to
the
fact
of
his
going
dorn
tried
to
compose
himself
to
rest
if
not
to
sleep
he
heard
sanborn
sit
down
and
then
apparently
stay
very
still
for
some
time
all
of
a
sudden
he
whispered
to
himself
dorn
distinguished
the
word
hell
what
ailin
you
pard
drawled
brewer
sanborn
growled
under
his
breath
and
when
some
one
else
in
the
dugout
quizzed
him
curiously
he
burst
out
i
bet
you
galoots
the
state
of
california
against
a
dill
pickle
that
when
your
turn
comes
you
be
sick
in
your
gizzards
we
take
our
medicine
came
in
the
soft
quiet
voice
of
purcell
no
more
was
said
the
men
all
pretended
to
fall
asleep
each
ashamed
to
let
his
comrade
think
he
was
concerned
a
short
dull
heavy
rumble
seemed
to
burst
the
outer
stillness
for
a
moment
the
dugout
was
silent
as
a
tomb
no
one
breathed
then
came
a
jar
of
the
earth
a
creaking
of
shaken
timbers
some
one
gasped
involuntarily
another
whispered
by
god
the
real
thing
dorn
wondered
how
far
away
that
jarring
shell
had
alighted
not
so
far
it
was
the
first
he
had
ever
heard
explode
near
him
roaring
of
cannon
exploding
of
shell
this
had
been
a
source
of
talk
among
his
comrades
but
the
jar
the
tremble
of
the
earth
had
a
dreadful
significance
another
rumble
another
jar
not
so
heavy
or
so
near
this
time
and
then
a
few
sharply
connected
reports
clamped
dorn
as
in
a
cold
vise
shots
many
thousand
shots
had
he
heard
but
none
with
the
life
and
the
spite
and
the
spang
of
these
did
he
imagine
the
difference
cold
as
he
felt
he
began
to
sweat
and
continually
as
he
wiped
the
palms
of
his
hands
they
grew
wet
again
a
queer
sensation
of
and
weakness
seemed
to
possess
him
the
roots
of
his
seemed
numb
nevertheless
all
the
more
revolving
and
seemed
his
mind
the
officer
in
his
speech
a
few
hours
back
had
said
the
sector
to
which
the
battalion
had
been
assigned
was
alive
by
this
he
meant
that
active
bombardment
fire
throwing
and
or
attack
in
force
might
come
any
time
and
certainly
must
come
as
soon
as
the
germans
suspected
the
presence
of
an
american
force
opposite
them
that
was
the
stunning
reality
to
dorn
the
actual
existence
of
the
huns
a
few
rods
distant
but
realization
of
them
had
not
brought
him
to
the
verge
of
panic
he
would
not
flinch
at
confronting
the
whole
german
army
nor
did
he
imagine
he
put
a
great
price
upon
his
life
nor
did
he
have
any
abnormal
dread
of
pain
nor
had
the
teachings
of
the
bible
troubled
his
spirit
was
he
going
to
be
a
coward
because
of
some
incalculable
thing
in
him
or
force
operating
against
him
already
he
sat
there
shivering
and
sweating
with
the
load
on
his
breast
growing
laborsome
with
all
his
sensorial
being
absolutely
at
keenest
edge
rapid
footfalls
halted
his
they
came
from
above
outside
the
dugout
from
the
trench
dorn
come
out
called
the
corporal
dorn
response
was
instant
but
he
was
as
blind
as
if
he
had
no
eyes
and
he
had
to
feel
his
way
to
climb
out
the
indistinct
blurred
form
of
the
corporal
seemed
half
merged
in
the
pale
gloom
of
the
trench
a
cool
wind
whipped
at
dorn
hot
face
surcharged
with
emotion
the
nature
of
which
he
feared
dorn
followed
the
corporal
stumbling
and
sliding
over
the
wet
boards
knocking
bits
of
earth
from
the
walls
feeling
a
sick
icy
gripe
in
his
bowels
some
strange
light
flared
up
died
away
another
rumble
distinct
heavy
and
vibrating
to
his
left
somewhere
the
earth
received
a
shock
dorn
felt
a
wave
of
air
that
was
not
wind
the
corporal
led
the
way
past
motionless
men
peering
out
over
the
top
of
the
wall
and
on
to
a
widening
where
an
abutment
of
filled
bags
loomed
up
darkly
here
the
corporal
cautiously
climbed
up
breaks
in
the
wall
and
stooped
behind
the
fortification
dorn
followed
his
legs
did
not
feel
natural
something
was
lost
out
of
them
then
he
saw
the
little
figure
of
rogers
beside
him
dorn
turn
meant
rogers
relief
how
pale
against
the
night
appeared
the
face
of
rogers
as
he
peered
under
his
helmet
at
dorn
a
low
whining
passed
in
the
air
overhead
rogers
started
slightly
a
thump
sounded
out
there
interrupting
the
corporal
who
had
begun
to
speak
he
repeated
his
order
to
dorn
bending
a
little
to
peer
into
his
face
dorn
tried
to
open
his
lips
to
say
he
did
not
understand
but
his
lips
were
mute
then
the
corporal
led
rogers
away
that
moment
alone
out
in
the
open
with
the
strange
windy
pall
of
night
with
the
flares
like
along
the
horizon
with
a
rumble
here
and
a
roar
there
with
whistling
fiends
riding
the
blackness
above
with
a
series
of
popping
impelling
reports
seemingly
close
in
front
that
drove
home
to
kurt
dorn
a
cruel
and
present
and
unescapable
reality
at
that
instant
like
bitter
fate
shot
up
a
rocket
or
a
of
calcium
light
bursting
to
expose
all
underneath
in
pitiless
radiance
with
a
gasp
that
was
a
sob
dorn
shrank
flat
against
the
wall
staring
into
the
fading
circle
feeling
a
creep
of
paralysis
he
must
be
seen
he
expected
the
sharp
biting
series
of
a
or
the
bursting
of
a
bomb
but
nothing
happened
except
that
the
flare
died
away
it
had
come
from
behind
his
own
lines
control
of
his
muscles
had
almost
returned
when
a
heavy
boom
came
from
the
german
side
miles
away
perhaps
but
close
that
boom
meant
a
great
shell
speeding
on
its
hideous
mission
it
would
pass
over
him
he
listened
the
wind
came
from
that
side
it
was
cold
it
smelled
of
burned
powder
it
carried
sounds
he
was
beginning
to
appreciate
shots
rumbles
spats
and
thuds
whistles
of
varying
degree
all
isolated
sounds
then
he
caught
a
strange
low
moaning
it
rose
it
was
coming
fast
it
became
an
nearer
and
nearer
it
took
on
a
singing
whistle
it
was
passing
no
falling
a
mighty
blow
was
delivered
to
the
earth
a
jar
a
splitting
shock
to
windy
darkness
a
wave
of
heavy
air
was
flung
afar
and
then
came
the
soft
heavy
thumping
of
falling
earth
that
shell
had
exploded
close
to
the
place
where
dorn
stood
it
terrified
him
it
reduced
him
to
a
palpitating
stricken
wretch
utterly
unable
to
cope
with
the
terror
it
was
not
what
he
had
expected
what
were
words
anyhow
by
words
alone
he
had
understood
this
shell
thing
death
was
only
a
word
too
but
to
be
blown
to
atoms
it
came
every
moment
to
some
poor
devil
it
might
come
to
him
but
that
was
not
fighting
somewhere
off
in
the
blackness
a
huge
iron
monster
belched
this
hell
out
upon
defenseless
men
revolting
and
inconceivable
truth
it
was
dorn
ordeal
that
his
mentality
robbed
this
hour
of
novelty
and
of
adventure
that
while
his
natural
physical
fear
incited
panic
and
nausea
and
a
horrible
convulsive
internal
retching
his
highly
organized
exquisitely
sensitive
mind
more
like
a
woman
in
its
capacity
for
emotion
must
suffer
through
imagining
the
infinite
agonies
that
he
might
really
escape
every
shell
then
must
blow
him
to
bits
every
agony
of
every
soldier
must
be
his
but
he
knew
what
his
duty
was
and
as
soon
as
he
could
move
he
began
to
edge
along
the
short
beat
once
at
the
end
he
drew
a
deep
and
shuddering
breath
and
fighting
all
his
involuntary
instincts
he
peered
over
the
top
an
invisible
thing
whipped
close
over
his
head
it
did
not
whistle
it
cut
out
in
front
of
him
was
only
thick
pale
gloom
with
spectral
forms
leading
away
to
the
horizon
where
flares
like
of
a
summer
night
storm
ran
along
showing
smoke
and
bold
ragged
outlines
then
he
went
to
the
other
end
to
peer
over
there
his
eyes
were
keen
and
through
long
years
of
habit
at
home
going
about
at
night
without
light
he
could
see
distinctly
where
ordinary
sight
would
meet
only
a
blank
wall
the
flat
ground
immediately
before
him
was
bare
of
living
or
moving
objects
that
was
his
duty
as
sentinel
here
to
make
sure
of
no
surprise
patrol
from
the
enemy
lines
it
helped
dorn
to
realize
that
he
could
accomplish
this
duty
even
though
he
was
in
a
torment
that
space
before
him
was
empty
but
it
was
charged
with
current
wind
shadow
gloom
smoke
electricity
death
spirit
whatever
that
current
was
dorn
felt
it
he
was
more
afraid
of
that
than
the
occasional
bullets
which
zipped
across
sometimes
shots
from
his
own
squad
rang
out
up
and
down
the
line
off
somewhat
to
the
north
a
on
the
allies
side
spoke
now
and
then
spitefully
way
back
a
big
gun
boomed
dorn
listened
to
the
whine
of
shells
from
his
own
side
with
a
far
different
sense
than
that
with
which
he
heard
shells
whine
from
the
enemy
how
natural
and
yet
how
unreasonable
shells
from
the
other
side
came
over
to
destroy
him
shells
from
his
side
went
back
to
save
him
but
both
were
shot
to
kill
was
he
the
unknown
and
shrinking
novice
of
a
soldier
any
better
than
an
unknown
and
shrinking
soldier
far
across
there
in
the
darkness
what
was
equality
but
these
were
germans
that
thing
so
often
said
so
beaten
into
his
brain
did
not
convince
out
here
in
the
face
of
death
four
with
the
gray
light
came
a
gradually
increasing
number
of
shells
most
of
them
struck
far
back
a
few
to
right
and
left
dropped
near
the
front
line
the
dawn
broke
such
a
dawn
as
he
never
dreamed
of
smoky
and
raw
with
thunder
spreading
to
a
circle
all
around
the
horizon
he
was
relieved
on
his
way
in
he
passed
purcell
at
the
nearest
post
the
elegant
bore
himself
with
outward
calm
but
in
the
gray
dawn
he
looked
haggard
and
drawn
older
that
flashed
through
mind
a
single
night
had
contained
years
more
than
years
others
of
the
squad
had
subtly
changed
dixon
gave
him
a
penetrating
look
as
if
he
wore
a
mask
under
which
was
a
face
of
betrayal
of
contrast
to
that
soldier
bearing
of
youth
that
was
gone
forever
chapter
xxviii
the
squad
of
men
to
which
dorn
belonged
had
to
be
on
the
lookout
continually
for
an
attack
that
was
inevitable
the
germans
were
feeling
out
the
line
probably
to
verify
spy
news
of
the
united
states
troops
taking
over
a
sector
they
had
not
however
made
sure
of
this
fact
the
came
over
regularly
making
life
for
the
men
a
kind
of
suffocation
most
of
the
time
and
the
great
shells
that
blew
enormous
holes
in
front
and
in
back
of
their
position
never
allowed
a
relaxation
from
strain
drawn
and
haggard
grew
the
faces
that
had
been
so
and
brown
and
fresh
one
evening
at
mess
when
the
sector
appeared
quiet
enough
to
permit
of
rest
rogers
was
talking
to
some
comrades
before
the
door
of
the
dugout
it
sure
got
my
goat
that
little
promenade
of
ours
last
night
over
into
no
man
land
he
said
we
had
orders
to
slip
out
and
halt
a
german
patrol
that
was
supposed
to
be
stealing
over
to
our
line
we
crawled
on
our
bellies
looking
and
listening
every
minute
if
that
is
the
limit
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
i
could
breathe
and
for
the
first
moments
if
i
run
into
a
hun
i
had
no
more
strength
than
a
rabbit
but
all
seemed
clear
it
was
not
a
bright
night
sort
of
opaque
and
gloomy
shadows
everywhere
there
was
any
patrol
coming
but
corporal
owens
thought
he
heard
men
farther
on
working
with
wire
we
crawled
some
more
and
we
must
have
got
pretty
close
to
the
enemy
lines
in
fact
we
had
when
up
shot
one
of
those
damned
calcium
flares
we
all
burrowed
into
the
ground
i
was
paralyzed
it
got
as
light
as
noon
strange
flare
it
magnified
flat
as
i
lay
i
saw
the
german
embankments
not
fifty
yards
away
i
made
sure
we
were
goners
slowly
the
light
burned
out
then
that
you
all
heard
began
to
rattle
something
queer
about
the
way
every
shot
of
a
bites
the
air
we
heard
the
bullets
low
down
right
over
us
say
boys
i
almost
rather
be
hit
and
have
it
done
with
we
began
to
crawl
back
i
wanted
to
run
we
all
wanted
to
but
owens
is
a
nervy
guy
and
he
kept
whispering
another
cut
loose
and
bullets
rained
over
us
like
hail
they
hit
somewhere
ahead
scattering
the
gravel
we
almost
reached
our
line
when
smith
jumped
up
and
ran
he
said
afterward
that
he
just
could
help
himself
the
suspense
was
awful
i
know
i
been
a
clerk
in
a
bank
get
that
and
there
i
was
under
a
hail
of
hun
lead
without
being
able
to
understand
why
or
feel
that
any
time
had
passed
since
giving
up
my
job
to
go
to
war
queer
how
i
saw
my
old
desk
well
that
how
smith
got
his
i
heard
the
bullets
spat
him
sort
of
thick
and
soft
ugh
owens
and
i
dragged
him
along
and
finally
into
the
trench
he
had
a
bullet
through
his
shoulder
and
leg
guess
he
live
all
right
boys
take
this
from
me
nobody
can
you
what
a
is
like
a
rifle
now
is
not
so
much
you
get
shot
at
and
you
know
the
man
must
reload
and
aim
that
takes
time
but
a
whew
it
a
comb
a
comb
and
you
the
louse
it
after
you
hear
that
steady
rattle
and
then
you
hear
bullets
everywhere
think
of
a
man
against
a
it
not
a
square
deal
dixon
was
one
of
the
listeners
he
laughed
rogers
i
like
to
have
been
with
you
next
time
i
volunteer
you
had
action
a
run
for
your
money
that
what
i
enlisted
for
standing
still
doing
nothing
but
wait
that
drives
me
half
mad
my
years
of
football
have
made
action
necessary
otherwise
i
go
stale
in
mind
and
body
last
night
before
you
went
on
that
scouting
trip
i
had
been
on
duty
two
hours
near
midnight
the
shelling
had
died
down
all
became
quiet
no
flares
no
flashes
anywhere
there
was
a
luminous
kind
of
glow
in
the
sky
moonlight
through
thin
clouds
i
had
to
listen
and
watch
but
i
could
keep
back
my
thoughts
there
i
was
a
soldier
facing
no
man
land
across
whose
dark
space
were
the
huns
we
have
come
to
regard
as
devils
in
brutality
yet
less
than
men
and
i
thought
of
home
no
man
knows
what
home
really
is
until
he
stands
that
lonely
midnight
guard
a
shipwrecked
sailor
appreciates
the
comforts
he
once
had
a
desert
wanderer
lost
and
starving
remembers
the
food
he
once
wasted
a
volunteer
soldier
facing
death
in
the
darkness
thinks
of
his
home
it
is
a
hell
of
a
feeling
and
thinking
of
home
i
remembered
my
girl
i
been
gone
four
months
have
been
at
the
front
seven
days
or
is
it
seven
years
and
last
night
in
the
darkness
she
came
to
me
oh
yes
she
was
there
she
seemed
reproachful
as
she
was
when
she
coaxed
me
not
to
enlist
my
girl
was
not
one
of
the
kind
who
sends
her
lover
to
war
and
swears
she
will
die
an
old
maid
unless
he
returns
mine
begged
me
to
stay
home
or
at
least
wait
for
the
draft
but
i
was
built
that
way
i
enlisted
and
last
night
i
felt
the
bitterness
of
a
soldier
fate
all
this
beautiful
stuff
is
bunk
my
girl
is
a
peach
she
had
many
admirers
two
in
particular
that
made
me
run
my
best
down
the
stretch
one
is
he
could
fight
the
other
is
all
yellow
him
she
liked
best
he
had
her
fooled
the
damned
slacker
i
wish
i
could
believe
i
get
safe
back
home
with
a
few
huns
to
my
credit
the
croix
de
guerre
and
an
officer
uniform
that
would
be
great
how
i
could
show
up
those
fellows
but
i
get
killed
as
sure
as
god
made
little
apples
i
get
killed
and
she
will
marry
one
of
the
men
who
would
not
fight
it
was
about
the
middle
of
a
clear
morning
still
cold
but
the
sun
was
shining
guns
were
speaking
intermittently
those
soldiers
who
were
off
duty
had
their
in
their
hands
all
were
gazing
intently
upward
dorn
sat
a
little
apart
from
them
he
too
looked
skyward
and
he
was
so
absorbed
that
he
did
not
hear
the
occasional
rumble
of
a
distant
gun
he
was
watching
the
airmen
at
work
the
most
wonderful
and
famous
feature
of
the
war
it
absolutely
enthralled
dorn
as
a
boy
he
had
loved
to
watch
the
soaring
of
the
golden
eagles
and
once
he
had
seen
a
great
condor
swooping
along
a
how
he
had
envied
them
the
freedom
of
the
heights
the
loneliness
of
the
unscalable
crags
the
companionship
of
the
clouds
here
he
gazed
and
marveled
at
the
of
the
air
german
planes
had
ventured
over
the
lines
flying
high
and
english
planes
had
swept
up
to
intercept
them
one
was
rising
then
not
far
away
climbing
fast
like
a
with
prey
in
its
claws
its
color
its
framework
its
propeller
and
its
aviator
showed
distinctly
against
the
sky
the
buzzing
drone
of
its
motor
floated
down
the
other
aeroplanes
far
above
had
lost
their
semblance
to
mechanical
machines
they
were
now
the
eagles
of
the
air
they
were
rising
circling
diving
in
maneuvers
that
dorn
knew
meant
pursuit
but
he
could
not
understand
these
movements
to
him
the
looked
as
it
must
have
looked
to
an
indian
birds
of
prey
in
combat
dorn
recalled
verses
he
had
learned
as
a
boy
written
by
a
poet
who
sang
of
future
wars
in
the
air
what
he
prophesied
had
come
true
was
there
not
a
sage
now
who
could
pierce
the
veil
of
the
future
and
sing
of
such
a
thing
as
sacred
human
life
dorn
had
his
doubts
poets
and
dreamers
appeared
not
to
be
the
men
who
could
halt
materialism
strangely
then
as
dorn
gazed
bitterly
up
at
these
fierce
fliers
who
fought
in
the
heavens
he
remembered
the
story
of
the
three
wise
men
and
of
bethlehem
was
it
only
a
story
where
on
this
sunny
spring
morning
was
christ
and
the
love
of
man
for
man
at
that
moment
one
of
the
forward
aeroplanes
which
was
drifting
back
over
the
enemy
lines
lost
its
singular
grace
of
slow
sweeping
movement
it
poised
in
the
air
it
changed
shape
it
pitched
as
if
from
wave
to
wave
of
wind
a
faint
puff
of
smoke
showed
tiny
specks
visible
to
dorn
powerful
eyes
seemed
to
detach
themselves
and
fall
to
be
followed
by
the
plane
itself
in
sheer
downward
descent
dorn
leaped
to
his
feet
what
a
thrilling
and
terrible
sight
his
comrades
stood
bareheaded
red
faces
uplifted
and
wild
with
excitement
not
daring
to
disobey
orders
and
yell
at
the
top
of
their
lungs
dorn
felt
strong
above
the
softened
wonder
and
thought
of
a
moment
back
a
tingling
pulsating
wave
of
gushing
blood
go
over
him
like
his
comrades
he
began
to
wave
his
arms
and
stamp
and
bite
his
tongue
swiftly
the
doomed
plane
swept
down
out
of
sight
gone
at
that
instant
something
which
had
seemed
like
a
bird
must
have
become
a
broken
mass
the
other
planes
drifted
eastward
dorn
gasped
and
broke
the
spell
on
him
he
was
hot
and
wet
with
sweat
quivering
with
a
frenzy
how
many
thousand
soldiers
of
the
allies
had
seen
that
downward
flight
of
the
boche
dorn
pitied
the
destroyed
airman
hated
himself
and
had
all
the
fury
of
savage
joy
that
had
been
in
his
comrades
dorn
relieved
from
guard
and
rushed
back
to
the
dugout
he
needed
the
dark
of
that
dungeon
he
crawled
in
and
searching
out
the
remotest
blackest
corner
hidden
from
all
human
eyes
and
especially
his
own
he
lay
there
clammy
and
wet
all
over
with
an
icy
sickening
rend
like
a
wound
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
he
shut
his
eyes
but
that
did
not
shut
out
what
he
saw
help
me
god
he
whispered
to
himself
six
endless
months
had
gone
to
the
preparation
of
a
deed
that
had
taken
one
second
that
transformed
him
his
life
on
earth
his
spirit
in
the
beyond
could
never
be
now
what
they
might
have
been
and
he
sobbed
through
grinding
teeth
as
he
felt
the
disintegrating
agonizing
irremediable
forces
at
work
on
body
mind
and
soul
he
had
blown
out
the
brains
of
his
first
german
fires
of
hell
in
two
long
lines
bordering
a
barren
ghastly
hazy
strip
of
land
burst
forth
from
the
earth
from
holes
where
men
hid
poured
thunder
of
guns
and
stream
of
smoke
and
screeching
of
iron
that
worthless
strip
of
land
barring
deadly
foes
shook
as
with
repeated
earthquakes
huge
spouts
of
black
and
yellow
earth
lifted
to
the
dull
heavy
bursts
of
shells
pound
and
jar
whistle
and
whine
long
broken
rumble
and
the
rattling
concatenation
of
quick
shots
like
metallic
cries
exploding
of
iron
in
the
air
a
desert
over
which
thousands
of
puffs
of
smoke
shot
up
and
swelled
and
drifted
the
sliding
crash
far
away
the
sibilant
hiss
swift
overhead
boom
weeeee
eeeeooooo
from
the
east
boom
weeeee
eeeeooooo
from
the
west
at
sunset
there
was
no
the
night
was
all
the
more
hideous
along
the
horizon
flashed
up
the
hot
sheets
of
lightning
that
were
not
of
a
summer
storm
angry
lurid
red
these
upflung
blazes
and
flames
illumined
the
murky
sky
showing
in
the
fitful
and
flickering
intervals
wagons
driving
toward
the
front
and
patrols
of
soldiers
running
toward
some
point
and
great
upheavals
of
earth
spread
high
this
heavy
cannonading
died
away
in
the
middle
of
the
night
until
an
hour
before
dawn
when
it
began
again
with
redoubled
fury
and
lasted
until
daybreak
dawn
came
reluctantly
dorn
thought
he
was
glad
it
meant
a
charge
another
night
of
that
hellish
shrieking
and
bursting
of
shells
would
kill
his
mind
if
not
his
body
he
stood
on
guard
at
a
corporal
owens
lay
at
his
feet
wounded
slightly
he
would
not
retire
as
the
cannons
ceased
he
went
to
sleep
rogers
stood
close
on
one
side
dixon
on
the
other
the
squad
had
lived
through
that
awful
night
soldiers
were
bringing
food
and
drink
to
them
all
appeared
grimly
gay
dorn
was
not
gay
but
he
knew
this
was
the
day
he
would
laugh
in
the
teeth
of
death
a
slumbrous
slow
heat
burned
deep
in
him
like
a
covered
fire
fierce
and
hot
at
heart
awaiting
the
wind
watching
there
he
did
not
voluntarily
move
a
muscle
yet
all
his
body
twitched
like
that
of
the
trained
athlete
strained
to
leap
into
the
great
race
of
his
life
an
officer
came
hurrying
through
the
talking
hushed
men
on
guard
backs
to
the
trench
never
moved
their
eyes
from
the
forbidden
land
in
front
the
officer
spoke
look
for
a
charge
reserves
were
close
behind
he
gave
his
orders
and
passed
on
then
an
allied
gun
opened
up
with
a
boom
the
shell
moaned
on
over
dorn
saw
where
it
burst
sending
smoke
and
earth
aloft
that
must
have
been
a
signal
for
a
bombardment
of
the
enemy
all
along
this
sector
for
big
and
little
guns
began
to
thunder
and
crack
the
spectacle
before
dorn
hard
keen
eyes
was
one
that
he
thought
wonderful
far
across
no
man
land
which
sloped
somewhat
at
that
point
in
the
plain
he
saw
movement
of
troops
and
guns
his
eyes
were
telescopic
over
there
the
ground
appeared
grassy
in
places
with
green
ridges
rising
and
patches
of
brush
and
straggling
trees
standing
out
clearly
faint
squads
of
soldiers
passed
in
sight
with
helmets
flashing
in
the
sun
guns
were
being
hauled
forward
mounted
horsemen
dashed
here
and
there
vanishing
and
reappearing
and
all
through
that
wide
area
of
color
and
action
shot
up
live
black
spouts
of
earth
crowned
in
white
smoke
that
hung
in
the
air
after
the
earth
fell
back
they
were
beautiful
these
round
balls
of
white
smoke
magically
appeared
in
the
air
to
spread
and
drift
long
yellow
columns
or
streaks
rose
here
and
there
leaped
up
a
dirty
cloud
savage
and
sinister
sometimes
several
shells
burst
close
together
dashing
the
upflung
sheets
of
earth
together
and
blending
their
smoke
at
intervals
a
huge
explosion
like
a
geyser
rose
aloft
to
spread
and
mushroom
then
to
detach
itself
from
the
heavier
body
it
had
upheaved
and
float
away
white
and
graceful
on
the
wind
sinister
beauty
dorn
soon
lost
sight
of
that
there
came
a
gnawing
at
his
vitals
the
far
scene
of
action
could
not
hold
his
gaze
that
dark
uneven
hummocky
break
in
the
earth
which
was
a
goodly
number
of
rods
distant
yet
now
seemed
close
drew
a
startling
attention
dorn
felt
his
eyes
widen
and
pop
spots
and
dots
shiny
illusive
bobbed
along
that
break
behind
the
mounds
beyond
the
farther
banks
a
yell
as
from
one
lusty
throat
ran
along
the
line
of
which
dorn
squad
held
the
center
dorn
sight
had
a
piercing
intensity
all
was
hard
under
his
grip
his
rifle
the
boards
and
bags
against
which
he
leaned
corporal
owens
rose
beside
him
bareheaded
to
call
low
and
fiercely
to
his
men
the
gray
dots
and
shiny
spots
leaped
up
magically
and
appallingly
into
men
german
soldiers
boches
huns
on
a
charge
they
were
many
but
wide
apart
they
charged
running
low
rattle
and
strangled
shouts
blended
along
the
line
from
the
charging
huns
seemed
to
come
a
sound
that
was
neither
nor
yell
nor
chant
yet
all
of
them
together
the
gray
advancing
line
thinned
at
points
opposite
the
but
it
was
coming
fast
dorn
cursed
his
hard
fumbling
hands
which
seemed
so
eager
and
fierce
that
they
stiffened
they
burned
too
from
their
grip
on
the
hot
rifle
shot
after
shot
he
fired
missing
he
could
not
hit
a
field
full
of
huns
he
dropped
shells
fumbled
with
them
at
the
breech
loaded
wildly
aimed
at
random
pulled
convulsively
his
brain
was
on
fire
he
had
no
anger
no
fear
only
a
great
and
futile
eagerness
yell
and
crack
filled
his
ears
the
gray
stolid
unalterable
huns
must
be
driven
back
dorn
loaded
crushed
his
rifle
steady
pointed
low
at
a
great
gray
bulk
and
fired
that
hun
pitched
down
out
of
the
gray
advancing
line
the
sight
almost
overcame
dorn
dizzy
with
blurred
eyes
he
leaned
over
his
gun
his
abdomen
and
breast
heaved
and
he
strangled
over
his
gorge
almost
he
fainted
but
violence
beside
him
somehow
great
heaps
of
dust
and
gravel
flung
over
him
hoarse
wild
yells
in
his
ears
roused
him
the
boches
were
on
the
line
he
leaped
up
through
the
dust
he
saw
charging
gray
forms
thick
and
heavy
they
plunged
as
if
actuated
by
one
will
bulky
blond
men
ashen
of
face
with
eyes
of
blue
fire
and
brutal
mouths
set
grim
huns
up
out
of
the
shallow
trench
sprang
comrades
on
each
side
of
dorn
no
rats
to
be
cornered
in
a
hole
dorn
seemed
drawn
by
powerful
hauling
chains
he
did
not
need
to
climb
four
big
germans
appeared
simultaneously
upon
the
embankment
of
bags
they
were
shooting
one
swung
aloft
an
arm
and
closed
fist
he
yelled
like
a
demon
he
was
a
on
the
instant
a
bullet
hit
dorn
tearing
at
the
side
of
his
head
stinging
excruciatingly
knocking
him
down
flooding
his
face
with
blood
the
shock
like
a
weight
held
him
down
but
he
was
not
dazed
a
body
rolled
down
beside
him
convulsively
flopped
against
him
he
bounded
erect
his
ears
filled
with
a
hoarse
and
clicking
din
his
heart
strangely
lifting
in
his
breast
only
one
german
now
stood
upon
the
embankment
of
bags
and
he
was
the
threatening
the
others
were
down
gray
forms
wrestling
with
brown
dixon
was
lunging
at
the
and
reaching
him
with
the
bayonet
ran
him
through
the
belly
he
toppled
over
with
an
awful
cry
and
fell
hard
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
of
loaded
bags
the
bomb
exploded
in
the
streaky
burst
dixon
seemed
to
charge
in
bulk
to
be
flung
aside
like
a
leaf
by
a
gale
little
rogers
had
engaged
an
enemy
who
towered
over
him
they
feinted
swung
and
cracked
their
guns
together
then
locked
bayonets
another
german
striding
from
behind
stabbed
rogers
in
the
back
he
writhed
off
the
bloody
bayonet
falling
toward
dorn
showing
a
white
face
that
changed
as
he
fell
with
quiver
of
torture
and
dying
eyes
that
dormant
inhibited
self
of
dorn
suddenly
was
no
more
fast
as
a
flash
he
was
upon
the
murdering
hun
bayonet
and
lunged
through
him
and
so
terrible
was
the
thrust
that
the
german
was
thrown
back
as
if
at
a
blow
from
a
dorn
whirled
the
bloody
bayonet
and
it
crashed
to
the
ground
the
rifle
of
the
other
german
dorn
saw
not
the
visage
of
the
foe
only
the
body
and
this
he
ripped
open
in
one
mighty
slash
the
german
life
spilled
out
horribly
dorn
leaped
over
the
bloody
mass
owens
lay
next
alive
but
stricken
purcell
fought
with
clubbed
rifle
backing
away
from
several
foes
brewer
was
being
beaten
down
gray
forms
closing
in
dorn
saw
leveled
small
guns
flashes
of
red
the
impact
of
lead
striking
him
but
he
heard
no
shots
the
roar
in
his
ears
was
the
filling
of
a
gulf
out
of
that
gulf
pierced
his
laugh
gray
forms
guns
bullets
bayonets
death
he
laughed
at
them
his
moment
had
come
here
he
would
pay
his
immense
and
terrible
joy
bridged
the
ages
between
the
past
and
this
moment
when
he
leaped
light
and
swift
like
a
huge
cat
upon
them
they
fired
and
they
hit
but
dorn
sprang
on
tigerishly
with
his
loud
and
nameless
laugh
bayonets
thrust
at
him
were
straws
these
enemies
gave
way
appalled
with
sweep
and
lunge
he
killed
one
and
split
a
second
skull
before
the
first
had
fallen
a
third
he
lifted
and
upset
and
gored
like
a
bull
in
one
single
stroke
the
fourth
and
last
of
that
group
screaming
his
terror
and
fury
ran
in
close
to
get
beyond
that
sweeping
blade
he
fired
as
he
ran
dorn
tripped
him
heavily
and
he
had
scarcely
struck
the
ground
when
that
steel
transfixed
his
bulging
throat
brewer
was
down
but
purcell
had
been
reinforced
soldiers
in
brown
came
on
the
run
shooting
yelling
brandishing
they
closed
in
on
the
germans
and
dorn
ran
into
that
mêlée
to
make
one
thrust
at
each
gray
form
he
encountered
shriller
yells
along
the
line
american
yells
the
enemy
there
had
given
ground
dorn
heard
he
saw
the
gray
line
waver
he
saw
reserves
running
to
aid
his
squad
the
germans
would
be
beaten
back
there
was
whirling
blackness
in
his
head
through
which
he
seemed
to
see
the
laugh
broke
hoarse
and
harsh
from
his
throat
dust
and
blood
choked
him
another
gray
form
blocked
his
leaping
way
dorn
saw
only
low
down
the
gray
arms
reaching
with
bright
unstained
blade
his
own
bloody
bayonet
clashed
against
it
locked
and
felt
the
helplessness
of
the
arms
that
wielded
it
an
instant
of
pause
a
heaving
breathless
instinct
of
impending
exhaustion
a
moment
when
the
petrific
mace
of
primitive
man
stayed
at
the
return
of
the
human
then
with
bloody
foam
on
his
lips
dorn
spent
his
madness
a
supple
twist
the
french
trick
and
dorn
powerful
lunge
with
all
his
ponderous
weight
drove
his
bayonet
through
the
enemy
lungs
ma
rod
came
the
strange
strangling
cry
a
weight
sagged
down
on
dorn
rifle
he
did
not
pull
out
the
bayonet
but
as
it
lowered
with
the
burden
of
the
body
his
eyes
fixed
at
one
height
suddenly
had
brought
into
their
range
the
face
of
his
foe
a
boy
dying
on
his
bayonet
then
came
a
resurrection
of
kurt
soul
he
looked
at
what
must
be
his
last
deed
as
a
soldier
his
mind
halted
he
saw
only
the
ghastly
face
the
eyes
in
which
he
expected
to
see
hate
but
saw
only
love
of
life
suddenly
reborn
suddenly
surprised
at
death
god
save
you
german
i
give
my
life
for
yours
too
late
dorn
watched
the
youth
last
clutching
of
empty
fingers
the
last
look
of
consciousness
at
his
conqueror
the
last
quiver
the
youth
died
and
slid
back
off
the
rigid
bayonet
war
of
men
a
heavy
thud
sounded
to
the
left
of
dorn
a
bursting
flash
hid
the
face
of
his
german
victim
a
terrific
wind
sharp
and
hard
as
nails
lifted
dorn
into
roaring
blackness
chapter

many
waters
shone
white
and
green
under
the
bright
may
sunshine
seen
from
the
height
of
slope
the
winding
brooks
looked
like
silver
bands
across
a
vast
belt
of
rainy

and
purple
that
bordered
the
broad

in

a
summer
haze
filled
the
air
and
hints
of
gold
on
the
waving

slopes
presaged
an

bountiful
harvest
it
was
warm
up
there
on

where
lenore

watched
and
brooded
the

brought
fragrant
smell
of

and
the

of

the

gleamed

down

a
crept
along

with
its

of

two
miles
of
soft

lay
between
lenore
and
her
home
she
had
needed
the
loneliness
and
silence
and
memory
of
a
place
she
had
not
visited
for
many

had

it

for

private
mortally

so
had
read
the
brief
and
terrible
line
in
a

newspaper
publishing
an

despatch
of
pershing
no
more
that
had
been
the
only
news
of
kurt
dorn
for
a
long
time
a
month
had
dragged
by
of
doubt
of
hope
of
slow
despairing
up
to
the
time
of
that
fatal
announcement
lenore
had
scarcely
noted
the
fleeting
of
the
days
with
all
her
spirit
and
energy
she
had
thrown
herself
into
the
organizing
of
the
women
of
the
valley
to
work
for
the
interests
of
the
war
she
had
made
herself
a
leader
who
spared
no
effort
no
sacrifice
no
expense
in
what
she
considered
her
duty
conservation
of
food
intensive
farm
production
knitting
for
soldiers
liberty
loans
and
red

these
she
had
studied
and
mastered
to
the
end
that
the

of
the
great

had
accomplished
work
which
won
national
honor
it
had
been
excitement
joy
and
a
strange
fulfilment
for
her
but
after
the
shock
caused
by
the
fatal
news
about
dorn
she
had
lost
interest
though
she
had
worked
on
harder
than
ever
just
a
night
ago
her
father
had
gazed
at
her
and
then
told
her
to
come
to
his
office
she
did
so
and
there
he
said
you
workin
too
hard
you
got
to
quit
oh
no
dad
i
only
tired
she
had
replied
let
me
go
on
i
planned
so
no
he
said
banging
his
desk
you
run
yourself
down
but
father
these
are
could
i
do
less
could
i
think
of
you
done
wonders

been
the
life
of
this
work

one
else

carry
it
on
now
you
kill
yourself
an
this
war
has
cost
the
andersons
enough
should
we
count
the
cost
she
asked
anderson
had
sworn
no
we
should
but
i
not
goin
to
lose
my
girl
do
you
get
that
hunch
i
bought
bonds
by
the
bushel
given
thousands
to
your
relief
societies
i
gave
up
my
son
jim
an
that
cost
us
mother
i
raisin
a
million
bushels
of
wheat
this
year
that
the
government
can
have
an
i
starvin
to
death
because
i
do
get
what
i
used
to
eat
then
this
last
blow
dorn
that
fine
young
the
best
aw
lenore
but
dad
is
is
there
any
any
hope
anderson
was
silent
dad
she
had
pleaded
if
he
were
really
dead
buried
oh
would
i
feel
it
you
overworked
yourself
now
you
got
to
rest
her
father
had
replied
huskily
but
dad
i
said
no
i
a
heap
of
pride
in
what
you
done
an
i
sure
think
you
the
best
anderson
of
the
lot
that
all
now
kiss
me
go
to
bed
that
explained
how
lenore
came
to
be
alone
high
up
on
the
vast
watching
and
feeling
with
no
more
work
to
do
the
slow
climb
there
had
proved
to
her
how
much
she
needed
rest
but
work
even
under
strain
or
pain
would
have
been
preferable
to
endless
hours
to
think
to
remember
to
fight
despair
mortally
wounded
she
whispered
the
tragic
phrase
when
where
how
had
her
lover
been
mortally
wounded
that
meant
death
but
no
other
word
had
come
and
no
spiritual
realization
of
death
abided
in
her
soul
it
seemed
impossible
for
lenore
to
accept
things
as
her
father
and
friends
did
nevertheless
equally
impossible
was
it
not
to
be
influenced
by
their
practical
minds
because
of
her
nervousness
of
her
overstrain
she
had
lost
a
good
deal
of
her
mental
poise
and
she
divined
that
the
only
help
for
that
was
certainty
of
dorn
fate
she
could
bear
the
shock
if
only
she
could
know
positively
and
leaning
her
face
in
her
hands
with
the
warm
wind
blowing
her
hair
and
bringing
the
rustle
of
the
wheat
she
prayed
for
divination
no
answer
absolutely
no
mystic
consciousness
of
death
of
an
end
to
her
love
here
on
earth
instead
of
that
breathed
a
strong
physical
presence
of
life
all
about
her
in
the
swelling
waving
slopes
of
wheat
in
the
beautiful
butterflies
in
the
singing
birds
low
down
and
the
soaring
eagles
high
above
life
beating
and
surging
in
her
heart
her
veins
unquenchable
and
indomitable
it
gave
the
lie
to
her
morbidness
but
it
seemed
only
a
physical
state
how
could
she
find
any
tangible
hold
on
realities
she
lifted
her
face
to
the
lonely
sky
and
her
hands
pressed
to
her
breast
where
the
deep
ache
throbbed
heavily
it
not
that
i
ca
give
him
up
she
whispered
as
if
impelled
to
speak
i
i
given
him
up
it
this
torture
of
suspense
oh
not
to
but
if
that
newspaper
had
claimed
him
one
of
the
killed
i
not
believe
so
lenore
trusted
more
to
the
mystic
whisper
of
her
woman
soul
than
to
all
the
unproven
outward
things
still
trust
as
she
might
the
voice
of
the
world
dinned
in
her
ears
and
between
the
two
she
was
on
the
rack
loss
of
jim
loss
of
her
mother
what
unfilled
gulfs
in
her
heart
she
was
one
who
loved
only
few
but
these
deeply
when
they
were
gone
was
different
from
yesterday
when
they
were
here
different
because
memory
recalled
actual
words
deeds
kisses
of
loved
ones
whose
life
was
ended
utterly
futile
was
it
for
lenore
to
try
to
think
of
dorn
in
that
way
she
saw
his
stalwart
form
down
through
the
summer
haze
coming
with
his
springy
stride
through
the
wheat
yet
the
words
mortally
wounded
they
had
burned
into
her
thought
so
that
when
she
closed
her
eyes
she
saw
them
darkly
red
against
the
blindness
of
sight
pain
was
a
sluggish
stream
with
source
high
in
her
breast
and
it
moved
with
her
unquickened
blood
if
dorn
were
really
dead
what
would
become
of
her
selfish
question
for
a
girl
whose
lover
had
died
for
his
country
she
would
work
she
would
be
worthy
of
him
she
would
never
pine
she
would
live
to
remember
but
ah
the
difference
to
her
never
for
her
who
had
so
loved
the
open
the
silken
rustle
of
the
wheat
and
the
waving
shadows
the
slopes
the
birds
of
the
air
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
the
voice
of
child
and
the
sweetness
of
life
never
again
would
these
be
the
same
to
her
if
dorn
were
gone
forever
that
ache
in
her
heart
had
communicated
itself
to
all
her
being
it
filled
her
mind
and
her
body
tears
stung
her
eyes
and
again
they
were
dry
when
tears
would
have
soothed
just
as
any
other
girl
she
wept
and
then
she
burned
with
fever
a
longing
she
had
only
faintly
known
a
physical
thing
which
she
had
resisted
had
become
real
insistent
beating
through
love
and
loss
she
was
to
be
denied
a
heritage
common
to
all
women
a
weariness
dragged
at
her
noble
spirit
was
not
a
natural
thing
it
must
be
intelligence
seeing
the
higher
but
to
be
human
was
to
love
life
to
hate
death
to
faint
under
loss
to
throb
and
pant
with
heavy
sighs
to
lie
sleepless
in
the
long
dark
night
to
shrink
with
unutterable
sadness
at
the
wan
light
of
dawn
to
follow
duty
with
a
laggard
sense
to
feel
the
slow
ebb
of
vitality
and
not
to
care
to
suffer
with
a
breaking
heart
sunset
hour
reminded
lenore
that
she
must
not
linger
there
on
the
slope
so
following
the
lane
between
the
sections
of
wheat
she
wended
a
reluctant
way
homeward
twilight
was
falling
when
she
reached
the
yard
the
cooling
air
was
full
of
a
fragrance
of
flowers
freshly
watered
kathleen
appeared
on
the
path
evidently
waiting
for
her
the
girl
was
growing
tall
lenore
remembered
with
a
pang
that
her
full
mind
had
left
little
time
for
her
to
be
a
mother
to
this
sister
kathleen
came
running
excited
and
lenore
i
thought
you
never
come
she
said
i
know
something
only
dad
told
me
not
to
tell
you
then
do
replied
lenore
with
a
little
start
but
i
never
keep
it
burst
out
kathleen
breathlessly
dad
going
to
new
york
lenore
heart
contracted
she
did
not
know
how
she
felt
somehow
it
was
momentous
news
new
york
what
for
she
asked
he
says
it
about
wheat
but
he
ca
fool
me
he
told
me
not
to
mention
it
to
you
the
girl
was
keen
she
wanted
to
prepare
lenore
yet
did
not
mean
to
confide
her
own
suppositions
lenore
checked
a
rush
of
curiosity
they
went
into
the
house
lenore
hurried
to
change
her
outing
clothes
and
boots
and
then
went
down
to
supper
rose
sat
at
table
but
her
father
had
not
yet
come
in
lenore
called
him
he
answered
and
presently
came
tramping
into
the
blustering
and
cheerful
not
for
many
months
had
lenore
given
her
father
such
close
scrutiny
as
she
did
then
he
was
not
natural
and
he
baffled
her
a
fleeting
vague
hope
that
she
had
denied
lodgment
in
her
mind
seemed
to
have
indeed
been
wild
and
unfounded
but
the
very
fact
that
her
father
was
for
once
unfathomable
made
this
situation
remarkable
all
through
the
meal
lenore
trembled
and
she
had
to
force
herself
to
eat
lenore
i
like
to
see
you
said
her
father
at
last
as
he
laid
down
his
napkin
and
rose
almost
he
convinced
her
then
that
nothing
was
amiss
or
different
and
he
would
have
done
so
if
he
had
not
been
too
clever
too
natural
she
rose
to
follow
catching
kathleen
whisper
do
let
him
put
it
over
on
you
now
anderson
lighted
a
big
cigar
as
always
after
supper
but
to
delicate
sensitiveness
he
seemed
to
be
too
long
about
it
lenore
i
takin
a
run
to
new
york
leave
at
eight
an
i
want
you
to
sort
of
manage
while
i
gone
here
some
jobs
i
want
the
men
to
do
all
noted
down
here
an
you
answer
letters
calls
an
all
that
not
much
work
you
know
but
you
have
to
hang
around
somethin
important
might
turn
up
yes
dad
i
be
glad
to
she
replied
why
why
this
sudden
trip
anderson
turned
away
a
little
and
ran
his
hand
over
the
papers
on
his
desk
did
she
only
imagine
that
his
hand
shook
a
little
wheat
deals
i
reckon
mostly
he
said
an
mebbe
i
run
over
to
washington
he
turned
then
puffing
at
his
cigar
and
calmly
met
her
direct
gaze
if
there
were
really
more
than
he
claimed
in
his
going
he
certainly
did
not
intend
to
tell
her
lenore
tried
to
still
her
mounting
emotion
these
days
she
seemed
all
imagination
then
she
turned
away
her
face
will
you
try
to
find
out
if
kurt
dorn
died
of
his
wound
and
all
about
him
she
asked
steadily
but
very
low
lenore
i
sure
will
he
exclaimed
with
explosive
emphasis
no
doubt
the
sincerity
of
that
reply
was
an
immense
relief
to
anderson
once
in
new
york
i
can
pull
wires
if
need
be
i
absolutely
promise
you
find
out
what
all
you
want
to
know
lenore
bade
him
and
went
to
her
room
where
calmness
deserted
her
for
a
while
upon
recovering
she
found
that
the
time
set
for
her
father
departure
had
passed
strangely
then
the
oppression
that
had
weighed
upon
her
so
heavily
eased
and
lifted
the
moment
seemed
one
beyond
her
understanding
she
attributed
her
relief
however
to
the
fact
that
her
father
would
soon
end
her
suspense
in
regard
to
kurt
dorn
in
the
succeeding
days
lenore
regained
her
old
strength
and
buoyancy
and
something
of
a
control
over
the
despondency
which
at
times
had
made
life
misery
a
golden
day
of
sunlight
and
azure
blue
of
sky
ushered
in
the
month
of
june
many
waters
was
a
world
of
verdant
green
lenore
had
all
she
could
do
to
keep
from
flying
to
the
slopes
but
as
every
day
now
brought
nearer
the
possibility
of
word
from
her
father
she
stayed
at
home
the
next
morning
about
nine
while
she
was
at
her
father
desk
the
rang
it
did
that
many
times
every
morning
but
this
ring
seemed
to
electrify
lenore
she
answered
the
call
hurriedly
hello
lenore
my
girl
how
are
you
came
rolling
on
the
wire
dad
dad
is
it
you
cried
lenore
wildly
sure
is
just
got
here
are
you
an
the
girls
we
well
fine
oh
dad
you
need
send
the
car
i
hire
one
yes
yes
but
dad
oh
tell
me
wait
i
be
there
in
five
minutes
she
heard
him
slam
up
the
receiver
and
she
leaned
there
palpitating
with
the
queer
vacant
sounds
of
the
telephone
filling
her
ear
five
minutes
lenore
whispered
in
five
more
minutes
she
would
know
they
seemed
an
eternity
suddenly
a
flood
of
emotion
and
thought
threatened
to
overwhelm
her
leaving
the
office
she
hurried
forth
to
find
her
sisters
and
not
until
she
had
looked
everywhere
did
she
remember
that
they
were
visiting
a
girl
friend
after
this
her
motions
seemed
ceaseless
she
could
not
stand
or
sit
still
and
she
was
continually
going
to
the
porch
to
look
down
the
shady
lane
at
last
a
car
appeared
coming
fast
then
she
ran
indoors
quite
aimlessly
and
out
again
but
when
she
recognized
her
father
all
her
outward
fears
and
tremblings
vanished
the
broad
brown
flash
of
his
face
was
reality
he
got
out
of
the
car
lightly
for
so
heavy
a
man
and
taking
his
valise
he
dismissed
the
chauffeur
his
smile
was
one
of
gladness
and
his
greeting
a
hearty
roar
lenore
met
him
at
the
porch
steps
seeing
in
him
feeling
as
she
embraced
him
that
he
radiated
a
strange
triumph
and
finality
say
girl
you
look
somethin
like
your
old
self
he
said
holding
her
by
the
shoulders
fine
but
you
a
woman
now
where
are
the
kids
they
away
replied
lenore
how
you
stare
laughed
anderson
as
with
arm
round
her
he
led
her
in
anythin
queer
about
your
dad
handsome
mug
his
jocular
tone
did
not
hide
his
deep
earnestness
never
had
lenore
felt
him
so
forceful
his
ruggedness
seemed
to
steady
her
nerves
that
again
began
to
fly
anderson
took
her
into
his
office
closed
the
door
threw
down
his
valise
great
to
be
home
he
exploded
with
heavy
breath
lenore
felt
her
face
blanch
and
that
intense
quiver
within
her
suddenly
stilled
tell
me
quick
she
whispered
he
faced
her
with
flashing
eyes
and
all
about
him
changed
you
an
anderson
you
can
stand
shock
any
any
shock
but
suspense
i
lied
about
the
wheat
deal
about
my
trip
to
new
york
i
got
news
of
dorn
i
was
afraid
to
tell
you
yes

went
on
anderson
lenore
hands
went
out
in
mute
eloquence
he
was
all

anderson
hoarsely
but
he
alive
he
live

hands

my
girl
dorn

i
brought
him

he
here
screamed
lenore
yes
they
have
him
here
in
half
an
hour
lenore
fell
into
her
father
arms
blind
and
deaf
to
all
outward
things
the
light
of
day
failed
but
her
consciousness
did
not
fade
before
it
seemed
a
glorious
radiance
that
was
the
truth
lost
for
the
moment
blindly
groping
in
whirling
darkness
when
she
did
feel
herself
again
it
was
as
a
weak
dizzy
palpitating
child
unable
to
stand
her
father
in
alarm
and
probable
anger
with
himself
was
coaxing
and
swearing
in
one
breath
then
suddenly
the
joy
that
had
shocked
lenore
almost
into
collapse
forced
out
the
weakness
with
amazing
strength
she
blazed
she
radiated
she
burst
into
utterance
too
swift
to
understand
hold
on
there
girl

anderson

an
now
rustle
lenore
paced
and
crouched
and
lay
in
her
room
waiting
listening
with
an
intensity
that
hurt
when
a
slow
procession
of
men
and
carried
kurt
dorn
into
the
house
and
lenore
trembled
with
a
storm
of
emotion
all
her
former
agitation
love
agony
and
suspense
compared
to
what
she
felt
then
was
as
nothing
not
the
joy
of
his
being
alive
not
the
terror
of
his
expected
death
had
so
charged
her
heart
as
did
this
awful
curiosity
to
see
him
to
realize
him
at
last
a
step
a
knock
her
father
voice
lenore
come
her
ordeal
of
waiting
was
over
all
else
she
could
withstand
that
moment
ended
her
weakness
her
blood
leaped
with
the
irresistable
revivifying
current
of
her
spirit
unlocking
the
door
lenore
stepped
out
her
father
stood
there
with
traces
of
extreme
worry
fading
from
his
tired
face
at
sight
of
her
they
totally
vanished
good
you
got
nerve
you
can
see
him
now
alone
he
unconscious
but
he
not
been
greatly
weakened
by
the
trip
his
vitality
is
wonderful
he
comes
to
once
in
a
while
sometimes
he
rational
mostly
though
he
out
of
his
head
an
his
left
arm
is
gone
anderson
said
all
this
rapidly
and
low
while
they
walked
down
the
hall
toward
the
end
room
which
had
not
been
used
since
anderson
death
the
door
was
ajar
lenore
smelled
strong
pungent
odors
of
antiseptics
anderson
knocked
softly
come
out
you
men
an
let
my
girl
see
him
he
called
doctor
lowell
the
village
practitioner
lenore
had
known
for
years
tiptoed
out
important
and
excited
lenore
it
to
bad
he
said
kindly
and
he
shook
his
head
another
man
glided
out
with
the
movements
of
a
woman
he
was
not
young
his
aspect
was
pale
serious
lenore
this
is
jarvis
the
nurse
now
go
in
an
do
forget
what
i
said
she
closed
the
door
and
leaned
back
against
it
conscious
of
the
supreme
moment
of
her
life
dorn
face
strange
yet
easily
recognizable
appeared
against
the
white
background
of
the
bed
that
moment
was
supreme
because
it
showed
him
there
alive
justifying
the
spiritual
faith
which
had
persisted
in
her
soul
if
she
had
ever
in
moments
of
distraction
doubted
god
she
could
never
doubt
again
the
large
room
had
been
bright
with
white
curtains
softly
blowing
inward
from
the
open
windows
as
she
crept
forward
not
sure
on
her
feet
all
seemed
to
blur
so
that
when
she
leaned
over
the
still
face
to
kiss
it
she
could
not
see
clearly
her
lips
quivered
with
that
kiss
and
with
her
sob
of
thankfulness
my
soldier
she
prayed
then
with
her
head
beside
his
on
the
pillow
and
through
that
prayer
and
the
strange
stillness
of
her
lover
she
received
a
subtle
shock
sweet
it
was
to
touch
him
as
she
bent
with
eyes
hidden
terrible
it
would
be
to
look
to
see
how
the
war
had
wrecked
him
she
tried
to
linger
there
all
tremulous
all
gratitude
all
woman
and
mother
but
an
incalculable
force
lifted
her
up
from
her
knees
ah
she
gasped
as
she
saw
him
with
cleared
sight
a
was
at
her
heart
kurt
dorn
lay
before
her
gaze
a
man
and
not
the
boy
she
had
sacrificed
to
war
a
man
by
a
larger
frame
and
by
older
features
and
by
a
change
difficult
to
grasp
these
features
seemed
a
mask
transparent
unable
to
hide
a
beautiful
sad
stern
and
ruthless
face
beneath
which
in
turn
slowly
gave
to
her
startled
gaze
sloping
lines
of
pain
and
shades
of
gloom
and
the
pale
set
muscles
of
forced
manhood
and
the
faint
hectic
flush
of
fever
and
disorder
and
derangement
a
livid
angry
scar
smooth
yet
scarcely
healed
ran
from
his
left
temple
back
as
far
as
she
could
see
that
established
his
identity
as
a
wounded
soldier
brought
home
from
the
war
otherwise
to
lenore
his
face
might
have
been
that
of
an
immortal
suddenly
doomed
with
the
curse
of
humanity
dying
in
agony
she
had
expected
to
see
dorn
bronzed
haggard
gaunt
starved
bearded
and
bruised
and
battered
blinded
and
mutilated
with
gray
in
his
fair
hair
but
she
found
none
of
these
her
throbbing
heart
sickened
and
froze
at
the
nameless
history
recorded
in
his
face
was
it
beyond
her
to
understand
what
had
been
his
bitter
experience
would
she
never
suffer
his
ordeal
never
that
was
certain
an
insupportable
sadness
pervaded
her
soul
it
was
not
his
life
she
thought
of
but
the
youth
the
nobility
the
splendor
of
him
that
war
had
destroyed
no
intuition
no
divination
no
power
so
penetrating
as
a
woman
love
by
that
piercing
light
she
saw
the
transformed
man
he
knew
he
had
found
out
all
of
physical
life
his
hate
had
gone
with
his
blood
deeds
deeds
of
terror
had
left
their
imprint
upon
his
brow
in
the
shadows
under
his
eyes
that
resembled
blank
walls
potent
with
invisible
meaning
lenore
shuddered
through
all
her
soul
as
she
read
the
merciless
record
of
the
murder
he
had
dealt
of
the
strong
and
passionate
duty
that
had
driven
him
of
the
eternal
remorse
but
she
did
not
see
or
feel
that
he
had
found
god
and
stricken
as
he
seemed
she
could
not
believe
he
was
near
to
death
this
last
confounding
thought
held
her
transfixed
and
thrilling
gazing
down
at
dorn
until
her
father
entered
to
break
the
spell
and
lead
her
away
chapter

it
was
night
lenore
should
have
been
asleep
but
she
sat
up
in
the
dark
by
the
window
underneath
on
the
porch
her
father
with
his
men
as
audience
talked
like
a
torrent
and
lenore
hearing
what
otherwise
would
never
have
gotten
to
her
ears
found
listening
irresistible
slow
dragging
footsteps
and
the
clinking
of
spurs
attested
to
the
approach
of
cowboys

buses
with

on

a
mile
i
rode
some
in

day
but
this
was
the
ride
of
my
life
i
could
hear
myself
think
music
at
full
blast
roar
of
traffic
voices
like
whisperin
without
end
flash
of
red
an
white
blue
shine
of
a
thousand

down

wonderful

anderson
voice
broke
a
little
at
this
juncture
and
he
paused
all
was
still
except
the
murmur
of
the
running
water
and
the
song
of
the
insects
presently
anderson
cleared
his
throat
and
resumed
i
saw
five
hundred
australian
soldiers
just
arrived
in
new
york
by
way
of
panama
lean
wiry
boys
like
arizona
cowboys
looked
good

medals
some
one
said
the
germans
called
these
scotch
from
hell
when
i
heard
that
i
had
to
ask
questions
an
i
learned
these
fellows
were
simply
hell
with
cold
steel
after
i
heard
that
i
looked
again
an
wondered
why
i
had
seen
it
i
ought
to
know
men
then
i
saw
the
outfit
of
blue
devil
frenchmen
that
was
sent
over
to
help
stimulate
the
liberty
loan
when
i
seen
them
i
took
off
my
hat
i
knowed
a
heap
of
tough
men
an
bad
men
an
handy
men
an
fightin
men
in
my
day
but
i
reckoned
i
never
seen
the
like
of
the
blue
devils
i
ca
tell
you
why
boys
blue
devils
is
another
german
name
for
a
regiment
of
french
soldiers
they
had
it
on
the
any
western
man
just
to
look
at
them
would
think
of
wild
bill
an
billy
the
kid
geronimo
an
custer
an
see
that
mebbe
the
whole
four
mixed
in
one
might
have
made
a
blue
devil
my
young
friend
dorn
that
dyin
now
he
had
a
name
given
him
that
this
is
like
the
old
days
when
we
used
to
hit
on
right
pert
names
for
everybody
demon
dorn
they
called
him
an
he
got
that
handle
before
he
ever
reached
france
the
boys
of
his
outfit
gave
it
to
him
because
of
the
way
he
run
wild
with
a
bayonet
i
do
want
my
girl
lenore
ever
to
know
that
a
soldier
named
owens
told
me
a
lot
he
was
the
corporal
of
outfit
a
sort
of
foreman
i
reckon
anyway
he
saw
dorn
every
day
of
the
months
they
were
in
the
service
an
the
shell
that
done
dorn
made
a
cripple
of
owens
this
fellow
owens
said
dorn
had
not
got
so
close
to
his
until
they
reached
france
then
he
begun
to
have
influence
over
them
owens
did
know
how
he
did
it
in
fact
never
knew
it
at
all
until
the
outfit
got
to
the
front
somewhere
in
northern
france
in
the
first
line
they
were
days
in
the
first
line
close
up
to
the
germans
watchin
an
sneakin
all
the
time
shootin
an
dodgin
but
they
never
had
but
one
real
fight
that
was
when
one
mornin
the
germans
came
pilin
over
on
a
charge
far
outnumberin
our
boys
then
it
happened
lord
i
wish
i
could
remember
how
owens
told
that
scrap
boys
you
never
heard
about
a
real
scrap
it
takes
war
like
this
to
make
men
fighters
listen
now
an
i
tell
you
some
of
the
things
that
come
off
durin
this
german
charge
i
tell
them
just
as
they
come
to
mind
there
was
a
boy
named
griggs
who
ran
the
german
barrage
an
that
a
gantlet
seven
times
to
fetch
ammunition
to
his
pards
another
boy
on
the
same
errand
was
twice
blown
off
the
road
by
shells
an
then
went
back
owens
told
of
two
of
his
company
who
rushed
a
bunch
of
germans
killed
eight
of
them
an
captured
their
before
that
german
charge
a
big
shell
came
over
kicked
up
a
hill
of
mud
next
day
the
americans
found
their
sentinel
buried
in
mud
dead
at
his
post
with
his
bayonet
presented
owens
was
shot
just
as
he
jumped
up
with
his
pards
to
meet
the
chargin
germans
he
fell
an
dragged
himself
against
a
wall
of
bags
where
he
lay
watchin
the
fight
an
it
so
happened
that
he
faced
dorn
squad
which
was
attacked
by
three
times
their
number
he
saw
dorn
shot
go
down
an
thought
he
was
done
but
no
dorn
came
up
with
one
side
of
his
face
all
blood
dixon
a
college
football
man
rushed
a
german
who
was
about
to
throw
a
bomb
dixon
got
him
an
got
the
bomb
too
when
it
went
off
little
rogers
an
irish
boy
mixed
it
with
three
germans
an
killed
one
before
he
was
bayoneted
in
the
back
then
dorn
like
the
demon
they
named
him
went
on
the
stampede
he
had
a
different
way
with
a
bayonet
so
owens
claimed
an
dorn
was
heavy
powerful
an
fast
he
lifted
slung
those
two
germans
one
after
another
quick
as
that
like
you
toss
a
couple
of
wheat
sheafs
with
your
pitchfork
an
he
sent
them
rollin
with
blood
squirtin
all
over
an
then
four
more
germans
were
shootin
at
him
right
into
their
teeth
dorn
run
laughin
wild
an
terrible
owens
said
an
the
germans
could
stop
that
flashin
bayonet
dorn
ripped
them
all
open
before
they
stopped
floppin
he
was
on
the
bunch
that
killed
brewer
an
were
makin
it
hard
for
his
other
pards
whew
owens
told
it
all
as
if
it
took
lots
of
time
but
that
fight
was
like
lightnin
an
i
ca
remember
how
it
was
only
demon
dorn
laid
out
nine
germans
before
they
retreated
owens
seen
him
do
it
like
a
mad
bull
loose
then
the
shell
came
over
that
put
dorn
out
an
owens
too
well
dorn
had
a
mangled
arm
an
many
wounds
they
amputated
his
arm
in
france
patched
him
up
an
sent
him
back
to
new
york
with
a
lot
of
other
wounded
soldiers
they
expected
him
to
die
long
ago
but
he
hangs
on
he
full
of
lead
now
what
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
killin
some
men
take
my
boy
jim
would
have
been
like
that
so
there
boys
you
have
a
little
bit
of
american
fightin
come
home
to
you
straight
an
true
i
say
that
what
the
germans
have
roused
well
it
was
a
bad
day
for
them
when
they
figgered
everythin
on
paper
had
it
all
cut
an
dried
but
failed
to
see
the
spirit
of
men
lenore
tore
herself
away
from
the
window
so
that
she
could
not
hear
any
more
and
in
the
darkness
of
her
room
she
began
to
pace
to
and
fro
beginning
to
undress
for
bed
shaking
in
some
kind
of
a
frenzy
scarcely
knowing
what
she
was
about
until
sundry
knocks
from
furniture
and
the
falling
over
a
chair
awakened
her
to
the
fact
that
she
was
in
a
tumult
what
i
doing
she
panted
in
bewilderment
reaching
out
in
the
dark
to
turn
on
the
light
like
awakening
from
a
nightmare
she
saw
the
bright
light
flash
up
it
changed
her
feeling
who
was
this
person
whose
image
stood
reflected
in
the
mirror
lenore
recognition
of
herself
almost
stunned
her
what
had
happened
she
saw
that
her
hair
fell
wildly
over
her
bare
shoulders
her
face
shone
white
with
red
spots
in
her
cheeks
her
eyes
seemed
balls
of
fire
her
lips
had
a
passionate
savage
curl
her
breast
bare
and
heaving
showed
a
throbbing
tumultuous
heart
and
as
she
realized
how
she
looked
it
struck
her
that
she
felt
an
inexplicable
passion
she
felt
intense
as
steel
hot
as
fire
quivering
with
the
pulsation
of
rapid
blood
a
victim
to
irrepressible
thrills
that
rushed
over
her
from
the
very
soles
of
her
feet
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
something
glorious
terrible
and
furious
possessed
her
when
she
understood
what
it
was
she
turned
out
the
light
and
fell
upon
the
bed
where
as
the
storm
slowly
subsided
she
thought
and
wondered
and
sorrowed
and
whispered
to
herself
the
tale
of
dorn
tragedy
had
stirred
to
the
depths
the
primitive
hidden
and
unplumbed
in
the
unknown
nature
of
her
just
now
she
had
looked
at
herself
at
her
two
selves
the
and
girl
that
civilization
had
produced
and
the
blazing
panting
savage
woman
of
the
bygone
ages
she
could
not
escape
from
either
the
story
of
demon
dorn
terrible
fight
had
retrograded
her
for
the
moment
to
the
female
of
the
species
more
savage
and
dangerous
than
the
male
no
use
to
lie
she
had
gloried
in
his
prowess
he
was
her
man
gone
out
with
club
to
beat
down
the
brutes
that
would
steal
her
from
him
alas
what
are
we
what
am
i
she
whispered
do
i
know
myself
what
could
i
not
have
done
a
moment
ago
she
had
that
primitive
thing
in
her
and
though
she
shuddered
to
realize
it
she
had
no
regret
life
was
life
that
dorn
had
laid
low
so
many
enemies
was
grand
to
her
and
righteous
since
these
enemies
were
as
cavemen
come
for
prey
even
now
the
terrible
thrills
chased
over
her
demon
dorn
what
a
man
she
had
known
just
what
he
would
do
and
how
his
spiritual
life
would
go
under
the
woman
of
her
gloried
in
his
fight
and
the
soul
of
her
sickened
at
its
significance
no
hope
for
any
man
or
any
woman
except
in
god
these
men
these
boys
like
her
father
and
jake
like
dorn
and
his
comrades
how
simple
natural
inevitable
elemental
they
were
they
loved
a
fight
they
might
hate
it
too
but
they
loved
it
most
life
of
men
was
all
strife
and
the
greatness
in
them
came
out
in
war
war
searched
out
the
best
and
the
worst
in
men
what
were
wounds
blood
mangled
flesh
agony
and
death
to
men
to
those
who
went
out
for
liberation
of
something
unproven
in
themselves
life
was
only
a
breath
the
secret
must
lie
in
the
beyond
for
men
could
not
act
that
way
for
nothing
some
hidden
purpose
through
the
ages
anderson
had
summoned
a
great
physician
a
specialist
of
world
renown
lenore
of
course
had
not
been
present
when
the
learned
doctor
examined
kurt
dorn
but
she
was
in
her
father
study
when
the
report
was
made
to
lenore
this
little
man
seemed
all
intellect
all
science
all
electric
current
he
stated
that
dorn
had
upward
of
wounds
some
of
them
serious
most
trivial
and
all
of
them
combined
not
necessarily
fatal
many
soldiers
with
worse
wounds
had
totally
recovered
dorn
vitality
and
strength
had
been
so
remarkable
that
great
loss
of
blood
and
almost
complete
lack
of
nourishment
had
not
brought
about
the
present
grave
condition
he
will
die
and
that
is
best
for
him
said
the
specialist
his
case
is
not
extraordinary
i
saw
many
like
it
in
france
during
the
first
year
of
war
when
i
was
there
but
i
will
say
that
he
must
have
been
both
physically
and
mentally
above
the
average
before
he
went
to
fight
my
examination
extended
through
periods
of
his
unconsciousness
and
aberration
once
for
a
little
time
he
came
to
apparently
sane
the
nurse
said
he
had
noticed
several
periods
of
this
rationality
during
the
last
hours
but
these
and
the
prolonged
vitality
do
not
offer
any
hope
an
emotion
of
exceeding
intensity
and
duration
has
produced
lesions
in
the
kinetic
organs
some
passion
has
immeasurably
activated
his
brain
destroying
brain
cells
which
might
not
be
replaced
if
he
happened
to
live
he
might
be
permanently
impaired
he
might
be
neurasthenic
melancholic
insane
at
times
or
even
grow
permanently
so
it
is
very
sad
he
appears
to
have
been
a
fine
young
man
but
he
will
die
and
that
really
is
best
for
him
thus
the
man
of
science
summed
up
the
biological
case
of
kurt
dorn
when
he
had
gone
anderson
wore
the
distressed
look
of
one
who
must
abandon
his
last
hope
he
did
not
understand
though
he
was
forced
to
believe
he
swore
characteristically
at
the
luck
and
then
at
the
great
specialist
i
known
indian
who
could
give
that
doctor
cards
spades
he
exploded
with
gruff
finality
lenore
understood
her
father
perfectly
and
imagined
she
understood
the
celebrated
scientist
the
former
was
just
human
and
the
latter
was
simply
knowledge
neither
had
that
which
caused
her
to
go
out
alone
into
the
dark
night
and
look
up
beyond
the
slope
to
the
stars
these
men
particularly
the
scientist
lacked
something
he
possessed
all
the
wonderful
knowledge
of
body
and
brain
of
the
metabolism
and
chemistry
of
the
organs
but
he
knew
nothing
of
the
source
of
life
lenore
accorded
science
its
place
in
progress
but
she
hated
its
elimination
of
the
soul
stronger
than
ever
strength
to
endure
and
to
trust
pervaded
her
spirit
the
dark
night
encompassing
her
the
vast
lonely
heave
of
the
dim
sky
with
its
steady
stars
these
were
voices
as
well
as
tangible
things
of
the
universe
and
she
was
in
mysterious
harmony
with
them
lift
thine
eyes
to
the
hills
from
whence
cometh
thy
help
the
day
following
the
specialist
visit
dorn
surprised
the
family
doctor
the
nurse
anderson
and
all
except
lenore
by
awakening
to
a
spell
of
consciousness
which
seemed
to
lift
for
the
time
at
least
the
shadow
of
death
kathleen
was
the
first
to
burst
in
upon
lenore
with
the
wonderful
news
lenore
could
only
gasp
her
intense
eagerness
and
sit
trembling
hands
over
her
heart
while
the
child
babbled
i
listened
and
i
peeped
in
was
kathleen
reiterated
statement
kurt
was
awake
he
spoke
too
but
very
soft
say
he
knows
he
at
waters
i
heard
him
say
oh
i
so
happy
lenore
that
before
he
dies
he
know
you
talk
to
you
hush
child
whispered
lenore
kurt
not
going
to
die
but
they
all
say
so
that
funny
little
doctor
yesterday
he
made
me
tired
but
he
said
so
i
heard
him
as
dad
put
him
into
the
car
yes
kathie
i
heard
him
too
but
i
do
not
believe
replied
lenore
dreamily
kurt
does
look
so
so
sick
went
on
kathleen
only
only
i
know
what
different
i
guess
i
crazy
to
go
in
to
see
him
lenore
will
they
ever
let
me
their
father
abrupt
entrance
interrupted
the
conversation
he
was
pale
forceful
as
when
issues
were
at
stake
but
were
undecided
kathie
go
out
he
said
lenore
rose
to
face
him
my
girl
dorn
come
to
an
he
asked
for
you
i
was
for
lettin
him
see
you
but
lowell
an
jarvis
say
no
not
yet
now
he
might
die
any
minute
seems
to
me
he
ought
to
see
you
it
right
an
if
you
say
so
yes
replied
lenore
by
heaven
he
shall
see
you
then
said
anderson
breathing
hard
justified
even
even
if
it
he
did
not
finish
his
significant
speech
but
left
her
abruptly
presently
lenore
was
summoned
when
she
left
her
room
she
was
in
the
throes
of
uncontrolled
agitation
and
all
down
the
long
hallway
she
fought
herself
at
the
door
she
paused
to
lean
against
the
wall
there
she
had
the
will
to
still
her
nerves
to
acquire
serenity
and
she
prayed
for
wisdom
to
make
her
presence
and
her
words
of
infinite
good
to
dorn
in
this
crisis
she
was
not
aware
of
when
she
moved
how
she
ever
got
to
dorn
bedside
but
seemingly
detached
from
her
real
self
serene
with
emotions
locked
she
was
there
looking
down
upon
him
lenore
he
said
with
voice
that
just
reached
her
gladness
shone
from
his
shadowy
eyes
welcome
home
my
soldier
boy
she
replied
then
she
bent
to
kiss
his
cheek
and
to
lay
hers
beside
it
i
never
hoped
to
see
you
again
he
went
on
oh
but
i
knew
murmured
lenore
lifting
her
head
his
right
hand
brown
bare
and
rough
lay
outside
the
coverlet
upon
his
breast
it
was
weakly
reaching
for
her
lenore
took
it
in
both
hers
while
she
gazed
steadily
down
into
his
eyes
she
seemed
to
see
then
how
he
was
comparing
the
image
he
had
limned
upon
his
memory
with
her
face
changed
you
older
more
beautiful
yet
the
same
he
said
it
seems
long
ago
yes
long
ago
indeed
i
am
older
but
all
well
that
ends
well
you
are
back
lenore
have
you
been
told
i
ca
live
yes
but
it
untrue
she
replied
and
felt
that
she
might
have
been
life
itself
speaking
dear
something
gone
from
me
something
vital
gone
with
the
shell
that
took
my
arm
no
she
smiled
down
upon
him
all
the
conviction
of
her
soul
and
faith
she
projected
into
that
single
word
and
serene
smile
all
that
was
love
and
woman
in
her
opposing
death
a
subtle
indefinable
change
came
over
dorn
lenore
i
paid
for
my
father
he
whispered
i
killed
huns
i
spilled
the
blood
in
me
i
hated
but
all
was
wrong
wrong
yes
but
you
could
not
help
that
she
said
piercingly
blame
can
never
rest
upon
you
you
were
only
an
american
soldier
oh
i
know
you
were
magnificent
but
your
duty
that
way
is
done
a
higher
duty
awaits
you
his
eyes
questioned
sadly
and
wonderingly
you
must
be
the
great
sower
of
wheat
sower
of
wheat
he
whispered
and
a
light
quickened
in
that
questioning
gaze
there
will
be
starving
millions
after
this
war
wheat
is
the
staff
of
life
you
get
well
listen
she
hesitated
and
sank
to
her
knees
beside
the
bed
kurt
the
day
you
able
to
sit
up
i
marry
you
then
i
take
you
home
to
your
for
a
second
lenore
saw
him
transformed
with
her
spirit
her
faith
her
love
and
it
was
that
for
which
she
had
prayed
she
had
carried
him
beyond
the
hopelessness
beyond
incredulity
some
guidance
had
divinely
prompted
her
and
when
his
mute
rapture
suddenly
vanished
when
he
lost
consciousness
and
a
pale
gloom
and
shade
fell
upon
his
face
she
had
no
fear
in
her
own
room
she
unleashed
the
strange
bonds
on
her
feelings
and
suffered
their
recurrent
surge
and
strife
until
relief
and
calmness
returned
to
her
then
came
a
flashing
uplift
of
soul
a
great
and
beautiful
exaltation
lenore
felt
that
she
had
been
gifted
with
incalculable
power
she
had
pierced
dorn
fatalistic
consciousness
with
the
truth
and
glory
of
possible
life
as
opposed
to
the
dark
and
evil
morbidity
of
war
she
saw
for
herself
the
wonderful
and
terrible
stairs
of
sand
which
women
had
been
climbing
all
the
ages
and
must
climb
on
to
the
heights
of
solid
rock
of
equality
of
salvation
for
the
human
race
she
saw
woman
the
primitive
the
female
of
the
species
but
she
saw
her
also
as
the
mother
of
the
species
made
to
save
as
well
as
perpetuate
learning
from
the
agony
of
and
the
meaning
of
him
who
said
thou
shalt
not
kill
tremendous
would
be
the
final
resistance
of
woman
to
the
brutality
of
man
women
were
to
be
the
saviors
of
humanity
it
seemed
so
simple
and
natural
that
it
could
not
be
otherwise
lenore
realized
with
a
singular
conception
of
the
splendor
of
its
truth
that
when
most
women
had
found
themselves
their
mission
in
life
as
she
had
found
hers
then
would
come
an
end
to
violence
to
greed
to
hate
to
war
to
the
black
and
hideous
imperfection
of
mankind
with
all
her
intellect
and
passion
lenore
opposed
the
theory
of
the
scientist
and
biologists
if
they
proved
that
strife
and
fight
were
necessary
to
the
development
of
man
that
without
violence
and
bloodshed
and
endless
contention
the
race
would
deteriorate
then
she
would
say
that
it
would
be
better
to
deteriorate
and
to
die
women
all
would
declare
against
that
and
in
fact
would
never
believe
she
would
never
believe
with
her
heart
but
if
her
intellect
was
forced
to
recognize
certain
theories
then
she
must
find
a
way
to
reconcile
life
to
the
inscrutable
designs
of
nature
the
theory
that
continual
strife
was
the
very
life
of
plants
birds
beasts
and
men
seemed
verified
by
every
reaction
of
the
present
but
if
these
things
were
fixed
materialistic
rules
of
the
existence
of
animated
forms
upon
the
earth
what
then
was
god
what
was
the
driving
force
in
kurt
dorn
that
made
some
kind
of
murder
which
overthrew
his
mind
what
was
the
love
in
her
heart
of
all
living
things
and
the
nameless
sublime
faith
in
her
soul
if
we
poor
creatures
fight
said
lenore
and
she
meant
this
for
a
prayer
let
the
women
fight
eternally
against
violence
and
let
the
men
forever
fight
their
destructive
instincts
from
that
hour
the
condition
of
kurt
dorn
changed
for
the
better
doctor
lowell
admitted
that
lenore
had
been
the
one
medicine
which
might
defeat
the
death
that
all
except
she
had
believed
inevitable
lenore
was
permitted
to
see
him
a
few
minutes
every
day
for
which
fleeting
interval
she
must
endure
the
endless
hours
but
she
discovered
that
only
when
he
was
rational
and
free
from
pain
would
they
let
her
go
in
what
dorn
condition
was
all
the
rest
of
the
time
she
could
not
guess
but
she
began
to
get
inklings
that
it
was
very
bad
dad
i
going
to
insist
on
staying
with
kurt
as
as
long
as
i
want
asserted
lenore
when
she
had
made
up
her
mind
this
worried
anderson
and
he
appeared
at
a
loss
for
words
i
told
kurt
i
marry
him
the
very
day
he
could
sit
up
continued
lenore
by
george
that
accounts
exclaimed
her
father
he
been
tryin
to
sit
up
an
we
had
hell
with
him
dad
he
will
get
well
and
all
the
sooner
if
i
can
be
with
him
more
he
loves
me
i
feel
i
the
only
thing
that
counteracts
the
the
madness
in
his
mind
the
death
in
his
soul
anderson
made
one
of
his
violent
gestures
i
believe
you
that
hits
me
with
a
bang
it
takes
a
woman
lenore
what
your
idea
i
want
to
to
marry
him
murmured
lenore
to
nurse
him
to
take
him
home
to
his
you
shall
have
your
way
replied
anderson
beginning
to
pace
the
floor
it
ca
do
any
harm
it
might
save
him
an
anyway
you
be
his
wife
if
only
for
by
george
we
do
it
you
never
gave
me
a
wrong
hunch
in
your
life
but
girl
it
be
hard
for
you
to
see
him
when
when
he
has
the
spells
spells
echoed
lenore
yes
you
been
told
that
he
raves
but
you
did
know
how
why
it
gets
even
my
nerve
it
fascinated
me
but
once
was
enough
i
stand
to
see
his
face
when
his
huns
come
back
to
him
his
huns
ejaculated
lenore
shuddering
what
do
you
mean
those
huns
he
killed
come
back
to
him
he
fights
them
you
see
him
go
through
strange
motions
an
it
as
if
his
left
arm
was
gone
he
used
his
right
arm
an
the
motions
he
makes
are
the
ones
he
made
when
he
killed
the
huns
with
his
bayonet
it
terrible
to
watch
him
the
look
on
his
face
i
heard
at
the
hospital
in
new
york
that
in
france
they
photographed
him
when
he
had
one
of
the
spells
i
hate
to
have
you
see
him
then
but
maybe
after
doctor
lowell
explains
it
understand
poor
boy
how
terrible
for
him
to
live
it
all
over
but
when
he
gets
well
when
he
has
his
and
me
to
fill
his
mind
those
spells
will
fade
maybe
maybe
i
hope
so
lord
knows
it
all
beyond
me
but
goin
to
have
your
way
doctor
lowell
explained
to
lenore
that
dorn
like
all
mentally
deranged
soldiers
dreamed
when
he
was
asleep
and
raved
when
he
was
out
of
his
mind
of
only
one
thing
the
foe
in
his
nightmares
dorn
had
to
be
held
forcibly
the
doctor
said
that
the
remarkable
and
hopeful
indication
about
dorn
condition
was
a
gradual
daily
gain
in
strength
and
a
decline
in
the
duration
and
violence
of
his
bad
spells
this
assurance
made
lenore
happy
she
began
to
relieve
the
nurse
during
the
day
and
she
prepared
herself
for
the
first
ordeal
of
actual
experience
of
dorn
peculiar
madness
but
dorn
watched
her
many
hours
and
would
not
or
could
not
sleep
while
she
was
there
and
the
tenth
day
of
his
stay
at
many
waters
passed
without
her
seeing
what
she
dreaded
meanwhile
he
grew
perceptibly
better
the
afternoon
came
when
anderson
brought
a
minister
then
a
few
moments
sufficed
to
make
lenore
dorn
wife
chapter
xxxi
the
remarkable
happened
scarcely
had
the
minister
left
when
kurt
smiling
wonder
and
happiness
sustained
a
break
as
sharp
and
cold
and
terrible
as
if
nature
had
transformed
him
from
man
to
beast
his
face
became
like
that
of
a
gorilla
struggling
up
he
swept
his
right
arm
over
and
outward
with
singular
twisting
energy
a
and
for
him
his
left
arm
was
still
intact
a
savage
unintelligible
yet
unmistakably
german
escaped
his
lips
lenore
stood
one
instant
petrified
her
father
grinding
his
teeth
attempted
to
lead
her
away
but
as
dorn
was
about
to
pitch
off
the
bed
lenore
with
piercing
cry
ran
to
catch
him
and
force
him
back
there
she
held
him
subdued
his
struggles
and
kept
calling
with
that
intensity
of
power
and
spirit
which
must
have
penetrated
even
his
delirium
whatever
influence
she
exerted
it
quieted
him
changed
his
savage
face
until
he
relaxed
and
lay
back
passive
and
pale
it
was
possible
to
tell
exactly
when
his
reason
returned
for
it
showed
in
the
gaze
he
fixed
upon
lenore
i
had
one
of
my
fits
he
said
huskily
oh
i
do
know
what
it
was
replied
lenore
with
quavering
voice
her
strength
began
to
leave
her
now
her
arms
that
had
held
him
so
firmly
began
to
slip
away
son
you
had
a
bad
spell
interposed
anderson
with
his
heavy
breathing
first
one
she
seen
lenore
i
laid
out
my
huns
again
said
dorn
with
a
tragic
smile
lately
i
could
tell
when
they
were
coming
back
did
you
know
just
now
queried
lenore
i
think
so
i
was
really
out
of
my
head
i
known
when
i
did
that
it
a
strange
feeling
thought
memory
and
action
drives
it
away
then
i
seem
always
to
to
kill
my
huns
all
over
again
lenore
gazed
at
him
with
mournful
and
passionate
tenderness
do
you
remember
that
we
were
just
married
she
asked
my
wife
he
whispered
husband
i
knew
you
were
coming
home
to
me
i
knew
you
would
not
die
i
know
you
will
get
well
i
begin
to
feel
that
too
then
maybe
the
black
spells
will
go
away
they
must
or
or
you
lose
me
faltered
lenore
if
you
go
on
killing
your
huns
over
and
over
it
be
i
who
will
die
she
carried
with
her
to
her
room
a
haunting
sense
of
dorn
reception
of
her
last
speech
some
tremendous
impression
it
made
on
him
but
whether
of
fear
of
domination
or
resolve
or
all
combined
she
could
not
tell
she
had
weakened
in
mention
of
the
return
of
his
phantoms
but
neither
dorn
nor
her
father
ever
guessed
that
once
in
her
room
she
collapsed
from
sheer
feminine
horror
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
dorn
change
from
a
man
to
a
gorilla
and
to
repeat
the
savage
orgy
of
remurdering
his
huns
that
was
too
much
for
lenore
she
who
had
been
invincible
in
faith
who
could
stand
any
tests
of
endurance
and
pain
was
not
proof
against
a
spectacle
of
dorn
strange
counterfeit
presentment
of
the
actual
and
terrible
killing
he
had
performed
with
a
bayonet
for
days
after
that
she
was
under
a
strain
which
she
realized
would
break
her
if
it
was
not
relieved
it
appeared
to
be
solely
her
fear
of
dorn
derangement
she
was
with
him
almost
all
the
daylight
hours
attending
him
watching
him
sleep
talking
a
little
to
him
now
and
then
seeing
with
joy
his
gradual
improvement
feeling
each
day
the
slow
lifting
of
the
shadow
over
him
and
yet
every
minute
of
every
hour
she
waited
in
dread
for
the
return
of
dorn
madness
it
did
not
come
if
it
recurred
at
night
she
never
was
told
then
after
a
week
a
more
pronounced
change
for
the
better
in
dorn
condition
marked
a
lessening
of
the
strain
upon
lenore
a
little
later
it
was
deemed
safe
to
dismiss
the
nurse
lenore
dreaded
the
first
night
vigil
she
lay
upon
a
couch
in
dorn
room
and
never
closed
her
eyes
but
he
slept
and
his
slumber
appeared
sound
at
times
and
then
restless
given
over
to
dreams
he
talked
incoherently
and
moaned
and
once
appeared
to
be
drifting
into
a
nightmare
when
lenore
awakened
him
next
day
he
sat
up
and
said
he
was
hungry
thereafter
lenore
began
to
lose
her
dread
well
son
let
talk
wheat
said
anderson
cheerily
one
beautiful
june
morning
as
he
entered
dorn
room
wheat
sighed
dorn
with
a
pathetic
glance
at
his
empty
sleeve
how
can
i
even
do
a
man
work
again
in
the
fields
lenore
smiled
bravely
at
him
you
will
sow
more
wheat
than
ever
and
harvest
more
too
i
should
smile
corroborated
anderson
but
how
i
only
one
arm
said
dorn
kurt
you
hug
me
better
with
that
one
arm
than
you
ever
did
with
two
arms
replied
lenore
in
sublime
assurance
son
you
lose
that
argument
roared
anderson
me
an
lenore
stand
pat
you
sow
more
an
better
wheat
than
ever
than
any
other
man
in
the
northwest
get
my
hunch
well
i
tell
you
later
now
see
here
let
me
declare
myself
about
you
i
seen
it
worries
you
more
more
now
you
gettin
well
you
miss
that
good
arm
an
you
feel
the
pain
of
bullets
that
still
lodge
somewhere
in
you
an
you
think
you
be
a
cripple
always
look
things
in
the
face
square
sure
compared
to
what
you
once
was
you
be
a
cripple
but
kurt
dorn
weighin
one
hundred
an
ninety
let
loose
on
a
bunch
of
huns
was
some
man
my
gawd
forget
that
an
forget
that
you
never
chop
a
cord
of
wood
again
in
a
day
look
at
facts
like
me
an
lenore
we
gave
you
up
an
here
you
with
us
comin
along
fine
an
you
be
able
to
do
hard
work
some
day
if
you
crazy
about
it
just
think
how
good
that
is
for
lenore
an
me
too
now
listen
to
this
anderson
unfolded
a
newspaper
and
began
to
read
continued
improvement
with
favorable
weather
conditions
in
the
states
and
encouraging
messages
from
the
northwest
warrant
an
increase
of
crop
estimates
made
two
weeks
ago
and
based
mainly
upon
the
government
report
in
all
probability
the
yield
from
winter
fields
will
slightly
exceed
bushels
increase
of
acreage
in
the
spring
states
in
unexpectedly
large
for
example
minnesota
food
administrator
says
the
addition
in
his
state
is
per
cent
instead
of
the
early
estimate
of
per
cent
throughout
the
spring
area
the
plants
have
a
good
start
and
are
in
excellent
condition
it
may
be
that
the
yield
will
rise
to
bushels
making
a
total
of
about
from
such
a
crop
could
be
exported
in
normal
times
and
by
conservation
the
surplus
can
easily
be
enlarged
to
or
even
in
canada
also
estimates
of
acreage
increase
have
been
too
low
it
was
said
that
the
addition
in
alberta
was
per
but
recent
reports
make
it
per
cent
canada
may
harvest
a
crop
of
bushels
or
nearly
more
than
last
year
our
allies
in
europe
can
safely
rely
upon
the
shipment
of
bushels
from
the
united
states
and
canada
after
the
coming
harvest
there
will
be
an
ample
supply
of
wheat
for
the
foes
of
germany
at
ports
which
can
easily
be
reached
in
addition
the
large
surplus
stocks
in
australia
and
argentina
will
be
available
when
ships
can
be
spared
for
such
service
and
the
ships
are
coming
from
the
builders
for
more
than
a
year
to
come
there
will
be
wheat
enough
for
our
war
partners
the
belgians
and
the
northern
european
neutral
countries
with
which
we
have
trade
agreements
lenore
eagerly
watched
her
husband
face
in
pleasurable
anticipation
yet
with
some
anxiety
wheat
had
been
a
subject
little
touched
upon
and
the
war
had
never
been
mentioned
great
he
exclaimed
with
a
glow
in
his
cheeks
i
been
wanting
to
ask
wheat
for
the
allies
and
neutrals
for
more
than
a
year
anderson
the
united
states
will
feed
and
save
the
world
i
reckon
son
we
sendin
thousands
of
soldiers
a
day
now
ships
are
buildin
fast
aeroplanes
comin
like
a
swarm
of
bees
money
for
the
government
to
burn
an
every
american
gettin
mad
dorn
the
germans
do
know
they
ruined
what
do
you
say
dorn
looked
very
strange
lenore
help
me
stand
up
he
asked
with
strong
tremor
in
his
voice
oh
kurt
you
not
able
yet
appealed
lenore
help
me
i
want
to
do
it
lenore
complied
wondering
and
frightened
yet
fascinated
too
she
helped
him
off
the
bed
and
steadied
him
on
his
feet
then
she
felt
him
release
himself
so
he
stood
free
what
do
i
say
anderson
i
say
this
i
killed
germans
who
had
grown
up
with
a
training
and
a
passion
for
war
i
been
a
farmer
i
did
not
want
to
fight
duty
and
hate
forced
me
the
germans
i
met
fell
before
me
i
was
shocked
gassed
and
bayoneted
i
took
wounds
and
then
it
was
a
shell
that
downed
me
i
saw
my
comrades
kill
and
kill
before
they
fell
that
is
american
our
enemies
are
driven
blinded
stolid
brutal
obsessed
and
desperate
they
are
german
they
lack
not
strength
nor
efficiency
nor
courage
but
soul
white
and
spent
dorn
then
leaned
upon
lenore
and
got
back
upon
his
bed
his
passion
had
thrilled
her
anderson
responded
with
an
excitement
he
plainly
endeavored
to
conceal
i
get
your
hunch
he
said
if
i
needed
any
assurance
you
given
it
to
me
to
hell
with
the
germans
let
do
talk
about
them
any
more

to
come

our
job

plans
that

a
bumper
crop

thousand
acres

much
for

i
got
mad
this
summer
i
blowed
myself

the
farms

that
ten
thousand
acres
anderson
gasped
dorn
yes
anderson
mimicked
the
rancher
my
blood
up
but
i
never
have
felt
so
good
about
it
if
you
had
come
back
the
land
not
all
paid
for
but
it
ours
we
meet
our
notes
i
been
up
there
twice
this
spring
you
never
know
a
few
hills
had
burned
over
last
harvest
olsen
an
your
other
neighbors
or
most
of
them
will
work
the
land
on
you
be
boss
an
sure
you
be
well
for
fall
sowin
that
make
you
the
biggest
sower
of
wheat
in
the
northwest
my
sower
of
wheat
murmured
lenore
seeing
his
rapt
face
through
tears
dreams
are
coming
true
he
said
softly
lenore
just
after
i
saw
you
the
second
time
and
fell
so
in
love
with
you
i
had
vain
dreams
of
you
but
even
my
wildest
never
pictured
you
as
the
wife
of
a
wheat
farmer
i
never
dreamed
you
loved
wheat
but
ah
i
do
replied
lenore
why
when
i
was
born
dad
bought
waters
and
sowed
the
slopes
in
wheat
i
remember
how
he
used
to
take
me
up
to
the
fields
all
green
or
golden
i
grown
up
with
wheat
never
want
to
live
anywhere
away
from
it
oh
you
must
listen
to
me
some
day
while
i
tell
you
what
know
about
the
history
and
romance
of
wheat
begin
said
dorn
with
a
light
of
pride
and
love
and
wonder
in
his
gaze
leave
that
for
some
other
time
interposed
anderson
son
would
it
surprise
you
if
i
tell
you
that
i
switched
a
little
in
my
ideas
about
the
no
replied
dorn
well
things
happen
what
made
me
think
hard
was
the
way
that
government
man
got
results
from
the
in
the
lumber
country
you
see
the
government
had
to
have
an
immense
amount
of
timber
for
ships
an
spruce
for
aeroplanes
had
to
have
it
quick
an
all
the
lumbermen
an
loggers
were
or
most
of
them
anyhow
all
the
lumbermen
last
summer
belonged
to
the
these
fellows
believed
that
under
the
capitalistic
order
of
labor
the
workers
an
their
employers
had
nothin
in
common
an
the
government
was
hand
an
glove
with
capital
now
this
government
official
went
up
there
an
convinced
the
that
the
best
interest
of
the
two
were
identical
an
he
got
the
work
out
of
them
an
the
government
got
the
lumber
he
dealt
with
them
fairly
those
who
were
on
the
level
he
paid
high
an
considered
their
wants
those
who
were
crooked
he
punished
accordin
to
their
offense
an
the
innocent
did
have
to
suffer
with
the
guilty
that
deal
showed
me
how
many
of
the
could
be
handled
an
got
to
reckon
with
the
most
all
the
in
the
country
belong
to
it
this
summer
i
give
the
square
harvesters
what
they
want
an
that
a
big
for
me
but
i
wo
stand
any
from
disorganizers
if
men
want
to
work
they
shall
have
work
at
big
pay
you
will
follow
out
this
plan
up
in
the
bend
country
we
meet
this
labor
union
after
the
war
there
may
come
trouble
between
labor
an
capital
it
begins
to
seem
plain
to
me
that
men
who
work
hard
ought
to
share
somethin
of
the
profits
if
that
does
settle
the
trouble
then
we
know
we
up
against
an
outfit
with
socialist
an
anarchist
leaders
time
enough
then
to
resort
to
measures
i
regret
we
practised
last
summer
anderson
you
fine
you
as
big
as
the
hills
burst
out
dorn
but
you
know
there
was
bad
blood
here
last
summer
did
you
ever
get
proof
that
german
money
backed
the
to
strike
and
embarrass
our
government
no
but
i
believe
so
or
else
the
leaders
took
advantage
of
a
critical
time
i
bound
to
say
that
now
thousands
of
laborers
are
loyal
to
the
united
states
and
that
made
me
switch
i
deal
with
them
the
same
way
responded
dorn
with
fervor
then
lenore
interrupted
their
discussion
and
pleading
that
dorn
was
quite
worn
out
from
excitement
and
exertion
she
got
her
father
to
leave
the
room
the
following
several
days
lenore
devoted
to
the
happy
and
busy
task
of
packing
what
she
wanted
to
take
to
dorn
home
she
had
set
the
date
but
had
reserved
the
pleasure
of
telling
him
anderson
had
agreed
to
her
plan
and
decided
to
accompany
them
i
take
the
girls
he
said
it
be
a
fine
ride
for
them
stay
in
the
village
overnight
an
come
back
home
next
day
lenore
it
strikes
me
your
leavin
what
will
become
of
me
all
at
once
he
showed
the
ravages
of
pain
and
loss
that
the
last
year
had
added
to
his
life
of
struggle
lenore
embraced
him
and
felt
her
heart
full
dad
i
not
leaving
you
she
protested
he
get
well
up
there
find
his
balance
sooner
among
those
desert
we
will
divide
our
time
between
the
two
places
remember
you
can
run
up
there
any
day
your
interests
are
there
now
dad
do
think
of
it
as
separation
kurt
has
come
into
our
family
and
we
just
going
to
be
away
some
of
the
time
thus
she
won
back
a
smile
to
the
worn
face
we
all
got
a
weak
spot
he
said
musingly
mine
is
here
an
a
fear
of
growin
old
an
bein
left
alone
that
selfish
but
lived
an
i
reckon
i
no
more
to
ask
for
lenore
could
not
help
being
sad
in
the
midst
of
her
increasing
happiness
joy
to
some
brought
to
others
only
gloom
life
was
sunshine
and
storm
youth
and
age
this
morning
she
found
kathleen
entertaining
dorn
this
was
the
second
time
the
child
had
been
permitted
to
see
him
and
the
immense
novelty
had
not
yet
worn
off
kathleen
was
a
if
she
had
been
devoted
to
dorn
before
his
absence
she
now
manifested
symptoms
of
complete
idolatry
lenore
had
forbidden
her
to
question
dorn
about
anything
in
regard
to
the
war
kathleen
never
broke
her
promises
but
it
was
plain
that
dorn
had
read
the
mute
anguished
wonder
and
flame
in
her
eyes
when
they
rested
upon
his
empty
sleeve
and
evidently
had
told
her
things
kathleen
was
white
and
beautiful
then
with
all
a
child
imagination
stirred
i
been
telling
kathie
how
i
lost
my
arm
explained
dorn
i
hate
germans
i
hate
war
cried
kathleen
passionately
my
dear
hate
them
always
said
dorn
when
kathleen
had
gone
lenore
asked
dorn
if
he
thought
it
was
right
to
tell
the
child
always
to
hate
germans
right
exclaimed
dorn
with
a
queer
laugh
every
day
now
he
showed
signs
of
stronger
personality
lenore
what
i
went
through
has
confused
my
sense
of
right
and
wrong
some
day
perhaps
it
will
all
come
clear
but
lenore
all
my
life
if
i
live
to
be
ninety
i
shall
hate
germans
oh
kurt
it
too
soon
for
you
to
to
be
less
narrow
less
passionate
replied
lenore
with
hesitation
i
understand
the
day
will
come
when
you
not
condemn
a
people
because
of
a
form
of
government
of
military
class
it
will
never
come
asserted
dorn
positively
lenore
people
in
our
country
do
not
understand
they
are
too
far
away
from
realities
but
i
was
six
months
in
france
i
seen
the
ruined
villages
thousands
of
refugees
and
i
met
the
huns
at
the
front
i
i
seen
the
realities
in
regard
to
this
war
i
can
only
feel
you
got
to
go
over
there
and
see
for
yourself
before
you
realize
you
understand
this
that
but
for
you
and
your
power
over
me
i
be
a
emotionally
out
man
but
through
you
i
seem
to
be
reborn
still
i
shall
hate
germans
all
my
life
and
in
the
what
ever
that
may
be
i
could
give
you
a
thousand
reasons
one
ought
to
suffice
you
read
of
course
about
the
regiment
of
frenchmen
called
blue
devils
i
met
some
of
them
got
friendly
with
them
they
are
great
beyond
words
to
tell
one
of
them
told
me
that
when
his
regiment
drove
the
huns
out
of
his
own
village
he
had
found
his
mother
disemboweled
his
wife
violated
and
murdered
his
sister
left
a
maimed
thing
to
become
the
mother
of
a
hun
his
daughter
carried
off
and
his
little
son
crippled
for
life
these
are
cold
facts
as
long
as
i
live
i
will
never
forget
the
face
of
that
frenchman
when
he
told
me
had
he
cause
to
hate
the
huns
have
i
i
saw
all
that
in
the
faces
of
those
huns
who
would
have
killed
me
if
they
could
lenore
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
oh
horrible
is
there
nothing
no
hope
only
she
faltered
and
broke
down
lenore
because
there
hate
does
not
prove
there
nothing
left
listen
the
last
fight
i
had
was
with
a
boy
i
did
know
it
when
we
met
i
was
rushing
head
down
bayonet
low
i
saw
only
his
body
his
blade
that
clashed
with
mine
to
me
his
weapon
felt
like
a
toy
in
the
hands
of
a
child
i
swept
it
aside
and
lunged
he
screamed
before
the
blade
reached
him
too
late
i
ran
him
through
then
i
looked
a
boy
of
nineteen
he
never
ought
to
have
been
forced
to
meet
me
it
was
murder
i
saw
him
die
on
my
bayonet
i
saw
him
slide
off
it
and
stretch
out
i
did
not
hate
then
i
have
given
my
life
for
his
i
hated
what
he
represented
that
moment
was
the
end
of
me
as
a
soldier
if
i
had
not
been
in
range
of
the
exploding
shell
that
downed
me
i
would
have
dropped
my
rifle
and
have
stood
strengthless
before
the
next
hun
so
you
see
though
i
killed
them
and
though
i
hate
now
there
something
something
strange
and
inexplicable
that
something
is
the
divine
in
you
it
is
god
oh
believe
it
my
husband
cried
lenore
dorn
somberly
shook
his
head
god
i
did
not
find
god
out
there
i
can
not
see
god
hand
in
this
infernal
war
but
can
what
called
you
so
resistlessly
what
made
you
go
you
know
the
debt
i
thought
i
ought
to
pay
and
duty
to
my
country
then
when
the
debt
was
paid
the
duty
fulfilled
when
you
stood
stricken
at
sight
of
that
poor
boy
dying
on
your
bayonet
what
happened
in
your
soul
i
do
know
but
i
saw
the
wrong
of
war
the
wrong
to
him
the
wrong
to
me
i
thought
of
no
one
else
certainly
not
of
god
if
you
had
stayed
your
bayonet
if
you
had
spared
that
boy
as
you
would
have
done
had
you
seen
or
heard
him
in
time
what
would
that
have
been
pity
maybe
or
scorn
to
slay
a
weaker
foe
no
no
no
i
ca
accept
that
replied
lenore
passionately
can
you
see
beyond
the
physical
i
see
only
that
men
will
fight
and
that
war
will
come
again
out
there
i
learned
the
nature
of
men
if
there
divinity
in
you
there
divinity
in
every
man
that
will
oppose
war
end
it
eventually
men
are
not
taught
right
education
and
religion
will
bring
peace
on
earth
to
man
no
they
will
not
they
never
have
done
so
we
have
educated
men
and
religious
men
yet
war
comes
despite
them
the
truth
is
that
life
is
a
fight
civilization
is
only
underneath
man
is
still
a
savage
he
is
a
savage
still
because
he
wants
the
same
he
had
to
have
when
he
lived
in
primitive
state
war
is
necessary
to
show
how
every
man
fights
for
food
clothing
shelter
it
called
competition
in
business
look
at
your
father
he
has
fought
and
beaten
men
like
neuman
look
at
the
wheat
farmers
in
my
country
look
at
the
they
all
fight
look
at
the
children
they
fight
even
at
their
games
their
play
is
a
battle
or
escaping
or
funeral
or
capture
it
must
be
then
that
some
kind
of
strife
was
implanted
in
the
first
humans
and
that
it
is
necessary
to
life
survival
of
the
fittest
exclaimed
lenore
in
earnest
bitterness
kurt
we
have
changed
you
are
facing
realities
and
i
am
facing
the
infinite
you
represent
the
physical
and
i
the
spiritual
we
must
grow
into
harmony
with
each
other
we
ca
ever
hope
to
learn
the
unattainable
truth
of
life
there
is
something
beyond
us
something
infinite
which
i
believe
is
god
my
soul
finds
it
in
you
the
first
effects
of
the
war
upon
you
have
been
trouble
sacrifice
pain
and
horror
you
have
come
out
of
it
impaired
physically
and
with
mind
still
clouded
these
will
pass
and
therefore
i
beg
of
you
do
grow
fixed
in
absolute
acceptance
of
the
facts
of
evolution
and
materialism
they
can
not
be
denied
i
grant
i
see
that
they
are
realities
but
also
i
see
beyond
them
there
is
some
great
purpose
running
through
the
ages
in
our
day
the
germans
have
risen
and
in
the
eyes
of
most
of
the
world
their
brutal
force
tends
to
halt
civilization
and
kill
idealism
but
that
only
apparent
only
temporary
we
shall
come
out
of
this
dark
time
better
finer
wiser
the
history
of
the
world
is
a
proof
of
a
slow
growth
and
perfection
it
will
never
be
attained
but
is
not
the
growth
a
beautiful
and
divine
thing
does
it
now
oppose
a
hopeless
prospect
life
is
inscrutable
when
i
think
only
think
without
faith
all
seems
so
futile
the
poet
says
we
are
here
as
on
a
darkling
plain
swept
by
confused
alarms
of
struggle
and
flight
where
ignorant
armies
clash
by
night
trust
me
my
husband
there
is
something
in
woman
the
instinct
of
creation
the
mother
that
feels
what
can
not
be
expressed
it
is
the
hope
of
the
world
the
mother
burst
out
dorn
i
think
of
that
in
you
suppose
i
have
a
son
and
war
comes
in
his
day
suppose
he
is
killed
as
i
killed
that
poor
boy
how
then
could
i
reconcile
that
with
this
this
something
you
feel
so
beautifully
this
strange
sense
of
god
this
faith
in
a
great
purpose
of
the
ages
lenore
trembled
in
the
exquisite
pain
of
the
faith
which
she
prayed
was
beginning
to
illumine
dorn
dark
and
tragic
soul
if
we
are
blessed
with
a
son
and
if
he
must
go
to
war
to
kill
and
be
killed
you
will
reconcile
that
with
god
because
our
son
shall
have
been
taught
what
you
should
have
been
taught
what
must
be
taught
to
all
the
sons
of
the
future
what
will
that
be
queried
dorn
the
meaning
of
life
the
truth
of
immortality
replied
lenore
we
live
on
we
improve
that
is
enough
for
faith
how
will
that
prevent
war
it
will
prevent
it
in
the
years
to
come
mothers
will
take
good
care
that
children
from
babyhood
shall
learn
the
of
fight
of
war
boys
will
learn
that
if
the
meaning
of
war
to
them
is
the
wonder
of
charge
and
thunder
of
cannon
and
medals
of
distinction
to
their
mothers
the
meaning
is
loss
and
agony
they
will
learn
the
terrible
difference
between
your
fury
and
eagerness
to
lunge
with
bayonet
and
your
horror
of
achievement
when
the
disemboweled
victims
lie
before
you
the
glory
of
a
statue
to
the
great
general
means
countless
and
nameless
graves
of
forgotten
soldiers
the
joy
of
the
conquering
army
contrasts
terribly
with
the
pain
and
poverty
and
unquenchable
hate
of
the
conquered
i
see
what
you
mean
rejoined
dorn
such
teaching
of
children
would
change
the
men
of
the
future
it
would
mean
peace
for
the
generations
to
come
but
as
for
my
boy
it
would
make
him
a
poor
soldier
he
would
not
be
a
fighter
he
would
fall
easy
victim
to
the
son
of
the
father
who
had
not
taught
this
beautiful
meaning
of
life
and
terror
of
war
i
want
my
son
to
be
a
man
that
teaching
would
make
him
all
the
more
a
man
said
lenore
beginning
to
feel
faint
but
not
in
the
sense
of
muscle
strength
courage
endurance
rather
there
never
was
peace
than
have
my
son
inferior
to
another
man
my
hope
for
the
future
is
that
men
will
come
to
teach
their
sons
the
wrong
of
violence
lenore
never
will
that
day
come
replied
dorn
she
saw
in
him
the
inevitableness
of
the
masculine
attitude
the
difference
between
man
and
woman
the
preponderance
of
blood
and
energy
over
the
higher
motives
she
felt
a
weak
little
woman
arrayed
against
the
whole
of
mankind
but
she
could
not
despair
unquenchable
as
the
sun
was
this
fire
within
her
but
it
come
she
insisted
gently
but
with
inflexible
spirit
yes
it
might
if
men
change
you
have
changed
yes
i
do
know
myself
if
we
do
have
a
boy
will
you
let
me
teach
him
what
i
think
is
right
lenore
went
on
softly
lenore
as
if
i
would
not
he
exclaimed
i
try
to
see
your
way
but
just
because
i
ca
i
never
oppose
you
teach
if
you
can
she
kissed
him
and
knelt
beside
his
bed
grieved
to
see
shadow
return
to
his
face
yet
thrilling
that
the
way
seemed
open
for
her
to
inspire
but
she
must
never
again
choose
to
talk
of
war
of
materialism
of
anything
calculated
to
make
him
look
into
darkness
of
his
soul
to
ponder
over
the
impairment
of
his
mind
she
remembered
the
great
specialist
speaking
of
lesions
of
the
organic
system
of
a
loss
of
brain
cells
her
inspiration
must
be
love
charm
care
a
healing
and
building
process
she
would
give
herself
in
all
the
unutterableness
and
immeasurableness
of
her
woman
heart
she
would
order
her
life
so
that
it
would
be
a
fulfilment
of
his
education
of
a
heritage
from
his
fathers
a
passion
born
in
him
a
noble
work
through
which
surely
he
could
be
saved
the
cultivation
of
wheat
do
you
love
me
she
whispered
do
i
nothing
could
ever
change
my
love
for
you
i
am
your
wife
you
know
the
shadow
left
his
face
are
you
really
lenore
anderson
lenore
dorn
it
is
a
beautiful
name
now
it
does
sound
sweet
but
you
my
wife
never
will
i
believe
you
will
have
to
very
soon
why
a
light
warm
and
glad
and
marveling
shone
in
his
eyes
indeed
lenore
felt
then
a
break
in
the
strange
aloofness
of
him
in
his
impersonal
gentle
acceptance
of
her
relation
to
him
i
going
to
take
you
home
to
your
chapter
xxxii
lenore
told
her
conception
of
the
history
and
the
romance
of
wheat
to
dorn
at
this
critical
time
when
it
was
necessary
to
give
a
trenchant
call
to
hope
and
future
in
the
beginning
man
struggle
was
for
life
and
the
mainstay
of
life
was
food
perhaps
the
original
discoverer
of
wheat
was
a
savage
who
in
roaming
the
forests
and
fields
forced
by
starvation
to
eat
bark
and
plant
and
berry
came
upon
a
stalk
of
grain
that
chewed
with
strange
satisfaction
perhaps
through
that
accident
he
became
a
sower
of
wheat
who
actually
were
the
first
sowers
of
wheat
would
never
be
known
they
were
older
than
any
history
and
must
have
been
among
the
earliest
of
the
human
race
the
development
of
grain
produced
wheat
and
wheat
was
ground
into
flour
and
flour
was
baked
into
bread
and
bread
had
for
untold
centuries
been
the
sustenance
and
the
staff
of
life
centuries
ago
an
old
chaldean
priest
tried
to
ascertain
if
wheat
had
ever
grown
wild
that
question
never
was
settled
it
was
universally
believed
however
that
wheat
had
to
have
the
cultivation
of
man
nevertheless
the
origin
of
the
plant
must
have
been
analogous
to
that
of
other
plants
must
necessarily
have
been
people
who
stayed
long
in
one
place
wandering
tribes
could
not
till
and
sow
the
fields
the
origin
of
wheat
furnished
a
legendary
theme
for
many
races
and
mythology
contained
tales
of
favoring
chosen
peoples
ancient
china
raised
wheat
centuries
before
christ
grains
of
wheat
had
been
found
in
prehistoric
ruins
the
dwellers
along
the
nile
were
not
blind
to
the
fertility
of
the
valley
in
the
days
of
the
pharaohs
the
old
river
annually
inundated
its
low
banks
enriching
the
soil
of
vast
areas
where
soon
a
ocean
of
wheat
waved
and
shone
under
the
hot
egyptian
sun
the
arabs
on
their
weird
beasts
of
burden
rode
from
the
desert
wastes
down
to
the
land
of
waters
and
of
plenty
rebekah
when
she
came
to
fill
her
earthen
pitcher
at
the
well
looked
out
with
dusky
dreamy
eyes
across
the
golden
grain
toward
the
mysterious
east
moses
when
he
stood
in
the
night
watching
his
flock
on
the
starlit
arabian
waste
felt
borne
to
him
on
the
desert
wind
a
scent
of
wheat
the
bible
said
he
maketh
peace
in
thy
borders
and
filleth
thee
with
the
finest
of
the
wheat
days
of
the
middle
ages
when
crude
grinding
made
impure
flour
were
the
days
of
the
oppressed
peasant
and
the
rich
landowner
dark
days
of
toil
and
poverty
and
war
of
blight
and
drought
and
famine
when
common
man
in
his
wretchedness
and
hunger
cried
out
bread
or
blood
but
with
the
spreading
of
wheat
came
the
dawn
of
a
higher
civilization
and
the
story
of
wheat
down
to
modern
times
showed
the
development
of
man
of
many
lands
surrounding
homes
of
prosperous
farmers
fruitful
toil
of
happy
peoples
the
miller
and
his
humming
mill
when
wheat
crossed
the
ocean
to
america
it
came
to
strange
and
wonderful
fulfilment
of
its
destiny
america
fresh
vast
and
free
with
its
sturdy
pioneers
ever
spreading
the
golden
grain
westward
with
the
advancing
years
when
railroad
lines
kept
pace
with
the
indomitable
with
unprecedented
harvests
yielding
records
to
each
succeeding
year
with
boundless
fields
tilled
and
planted
and
harvested
by
machines
that
were
mechanical
wonders
with
enormous
humming
and
whirring
each
grinding
daily
ten
thousand
barrels
of
flour
pouring
like
a
white
stream
from
the
steel
rolls
pure
clean
and
sweet
the
whitest
and
finest
in

america
the
new
county
became
in
the
salvation
of
starving
belgium
the
mainstay
of
england
the
hope
of
france
wheat
for
the
world
wheat
that
was
to
say

hideous
medieval
horde

rising
out
of
its
peaceful
slumber
to
a
mighty
wrath
magnificent
and
unquenchable
throwing
its
vast
resources
of
soil
its
endless
streams
of
wheat
into
the
gulf
of
war
it
was
an
exalted
destiny
for
a
people
its
truth
was
a
blazing
affront
in
the
face
of
autocracy
fields
and
toil
and
grains
of
wheat
first
and
last
the
salvation
of
mankind
the
freedom
and
the
food
of
the
world
far
up
the
bulge
of
valley
slope
above
the
gleaming
river
two
cars
climbed
leisurely
and
rolled
on
over
the
height
into
what
seemed
a
bare
and
lonely
land
of
green
it
was
a
day
in
june
filled
with
a
rich
thick
amber
light
with
a
fragrant
warm
wind
blowing
out
of
the
west
at
a
certain
point
on
this
road
where
anderson
always
felt
compelled
to
halt
he
stopped
the
car
this
day
and
awaited
the
other
that
contained
lenore
and
dorn
lenore
joy
in
the
ride
was
reflected
in
her
face
dorn
rested
comfortably
beside
her
upon
an
improvised
couch
as
he
lay
half
propped
up
by
pillows
he
could
see
out
across
the
treeless
land
that
he
knew
his
eyes
held
a
look
of
the
returned
soldier
who
had
never
expected
to
see
his
native
land
again
lenore
sensitive
to
every
phase
of
his
feeling
watched
him
with
her
heart
mounting
high
anderson
got
out
of
his
car
followed
by
kathleen
who
looked
glad
and
mischievous
and
pretty
as
a
wild
rose
i
just
never
can
get
by
this
place
explained
the
rancher
as
he
came
and
stood
so
that
he
could
put
a
hand
on
dorn
knee
look
son
lenore
do
you
miss
this
never
fear
dad
replied
lenore
it
was
i
who
first
told
you
to
look
here
terrible
big
and
bare
but
grand
exclaimed
kathleen
lenore
looked
first
at
dorn
face
as
he
gazed
away
across
the
length
and
breadth
of
land
could
that
land
mean
as
much
to
him
as
it
did
before
he
went
to
war
infinitely
more
she
saw
and
rejoiced
her
faith
was
coming
home
to
her
in
verities
then
she
thrilled
at
the
wide
prospect
before
her
it
was
a
scene
that
she
knew
could
not
be
duplicated
in
the
world
low
billowy
green
hills
bare
and
smooth
with
square
brown
patches
stretched
away
to
what
seemed
infinite
distance
valleys
and
hills
with
less
fallow
ground
than
ever
before
significant
and
striking
lost
the
meager
details
of
clumps
of
trees
and
dots
of
houses
in
a
green
immensity
a
million
shadows
out
of
the
west
came
waving
over
the
wheat
they
were
ripples
of
an
ocean
of
grain
no
no
bleached
roads
no
yellow
hills
june
and
the
desert
found
its
analogy
only
in
the
sweep
and
reach
a
thousand
hills
billowing
away
toward
that
blue
haze
of
mountain
range
where
rolled
the
oregon
acreage
and
mileage
seemed
insignificant
all
was
green
green
the
fresh
and
hopeful
color
strangely
serene
and
sweet
and
endless
under
the
azure
sky
beautiful
and
lonely
hills
they
were
eloquent
of
toil
expressive
with
the
brown
squares
in
the
green
the
lowly
homes
of
men
the
long
lines
of
roads
running
everywhither
overwhelmingly
pregnant
with
meaning
wheat
wheat
wheat
nothing
but
wheat
a
staggering
visual
manifestation
of
vital
need
of
noble
promise
that
that
rolled
out
anderson
waving
his
big
hand
as
if
words
were
useless
only
a
corner
of
the
great
old
what
would
the
germans
say
if
they
could
look
out
over
this
what
do
say
lenore
beautiful
she
replied
softly
like
the
rainbow
in
the
sky
promise
of
life
an
kathie
what
do
say
went
on
anderson
some
replied
kathleen
with
an
air
of
woman
wisdom
fetch
on
your
young
dad
and
i
pick
out
a
husband
an
son
finished
anderson
as
if
wistfully
yet
heartily
playing
his
last
card
he
was
remembering
jim
the
wild
but
beloved
son
the
dead
soldier
he
was
fearful
for
the
crowning
hope
of
his
years
as
ye
sow
so
shall
ye
reap
was
dorn
reply
strong
and
thrilling
and
lenore
felt
her
father
strange
content
twilight
crept
down
around
the
old
home
on
the
hill
dorn
was
alone
leaning
at
the
window
he
had
just
strength
to
lean
there
with
uplifted
head
lenore
had
left
him
alone
divining
his
wish
as
she
left
him
there
came
a
sudden
familiar
happening
in
his
brain
like
a
and
the
contending
tide
of
gray
forms
the
huns
rushed
upon
him
he
leaned
there
at
the
window
but
just
the
same
he
awaited
the
shock
on
the
ramparts
of
the
trench
a
ferocious
and
terrible
storm
of
brain
that
used
to
have
its
reaction
in
outward
violence
now
worked
inside
him
like
a
hot
wind
that
drove
his
blood
during
the
spell
he
fought
out
his
great
fight
again
for
the
thousandth
time
he
rekilled
his
foes
that
storm
passed
through
him
without
an
outward
quiver
his
huns
charged
again
bayoneted
again
and
he
felt
acute
pain
in
the
left
arm
that
was
gone
he
felt
the
closing
of
the
hand
which
was
not
there
his
huns
lay
in
the
shadow
stark
and
shapeless
with
white
faces
upward
a
line
of
dead
foes
remorseless
and
abhorrent
to
him
forever
damned
by
his
ruthless
spirit
he
saw
the
boy
slide
off
his
bayonet
beyond
recall
murdered
by
some
evil
of
which
dorn
had
been
the
motion
then
the
prone
gray
forms
vanished
in
the
black
gulf
of
dorn
brain
lenore
will
never
know
how
my
huns
come
back
to
me
he
whispered
night
with
its
trains
of
stars
softly
the
darkness
unfolded
down
over
the
dim
hills
lonely
tranquil
sweet
a
caroled
the
song
of
insects
very
faint
and
low
came
to
him
like
a
still
sad
music
of
humanity
from
over
the
hills
far
away
in
the
world
the
world
of
men
was
there
and
life
was
incessant
monstrous
and
inconceivable
this
old
home
of
his
the
old
house
seemed
full
of
sounds
of
mouse
and
cricket
and
leaf
against
the
roof
and
soft
night
wind
at
the
eaves
sounds
that
brought
his
boyhood
back
his
bare
feet
on
the
stairs
his
father
aloofness
his
mother
love
then
clearly
floated
to
him
a
slow
sweeping
rustle
of
the
wheat
it
stood
down
there
outside
his
window
a
moving
body
higher
than
the
gloom
that
rustle
was
a
voice
of
childhood
youth
and
manhood
whispering
to
him
thrilling
as
never
before
it
was
a
growing
rustle
different
from
that
when
the
wheat
had
matured
it
seemed
to
change
and
grow
in
volume
in
meaning
the
night
wind
bore
it
but
life
bursting
life
was
behind
it
and
behind
that
seemed
to
come
a
driving
and
a
mighty
spirit
beyond
the
growth
of
the
wheat
beyond
its
life
and
perennial
gift
was
something
measureless
and
obscure
infinite
and
universal
suddenly
dorn
saw
that
something
as
the
breath
and
the
blood
and
the
spirit
of
wheat
and
of
man
dust
and
to
dust
returned
they
might
be
but
this
physical
form
was
only
the
fleeting
inscrutable
moment
on
earth
springing
up
giving
birth
to
seed
dying
out
for
that
purpose
which
ran
through
the
ages
a
soft
footfall
sounded
on
the
stairs
lenore
came
she
leaned
over
him
and
the
starlight
fell
upon
her
face
sweet
luminous
beautiful
in
the
sense
of
her
compelling
presence
in
the
tender
touch
of
her
hands
in
the
whisper
of
woman
love
dorn
felt
uplifted
high
above
the
dark
pale
of
the
present
with
its
war
and
pain
and
clouded
mind
to
wheat
to
the
fertile
fields
of
a
golden
age
to
come
